    Breaking Free from the Circle of Affairs
    Party Branch Secretary Li Wanming of Sangzhuang Production Brigade, Hou'an People's Commune, Fucheng County, Hebei

    To fully mobilize the initiative of each member of the branch committee is an important prerequisite for the party branch to play its role as a fighting fortress. How can we mobilize everyone's initiative? I pondered this question while studying Chairman Mao's "On the Proper Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Methods of Work of Party Committees." The more I read, the more I felt enlightened. Chairman Mao said, "For things one does not understand or is not familiar with, one should ask the subordinates and not readily express agreement or disagreement." I, however, was subjective and arbitrary, putting my personal opinions first. Chairman Mao told us to "learn to play the piano," but I was grabbing everything at once, busy beyond measure. Chairman Mao said, "Collective leadership and personal responsibility, neither should be neglected." I, however, took everything upon myself, not practicing collective leadership. No wonder the work was not done well; it was because I did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    Having found the root of the problem, I repeatedly sought the opinions of each branch committee member. Zhang Zhenjiang said, "In the past, you took on most of the work, and we discussed less, so the committee members developed a dependent mindset. When they encountered things they couldn't understand, they were not enthusiastic and were afraid to voice their opinions, leading to a lack of coordination in the work." Sun Shuhe said, "I am the brigade leader, and production should be my responsibility. However, some things I had just arranged were overturned by you, so the brigade leaders said I was just a figurehead, and you were the one in charge, so I just didn't bother anymore." Listening to everyone's opinions and thinking about Chairman Mao's teachings, I said, "All these problems are my fault. From now on, I will definitely change."

    Based on everyone's opinions, the branch, in addition to democratically formulating and improving the meeting system, followed the principle of combining collective leadership with personal responsibility. The committee members divided their work. Major issues were collectively studied, and issues within their authority were handled independently. After the division of labor, each committee member knew their responsibilities clearly, and the work became more proactive. From then on, the heavy burden was shared by everyone, and everyone took care of what they were responsible for. Everything had a clear assignment, and everyone had their tasks. The committee members worked together as one, fully playing the role of collective leadership. This way, I was also freed from the tedious circle of affairs and had ample time to focus on political and ideological work.

    从事务圈子跳出来
    河北阜城县后安公社桑庄大队党支部书记　李万明
    把支委会每个成员的积极性充分调动起来，这是发挥党支部战斗堡垒作用的重要前提。怎么样才能把大家的积极性调动起来呢？我带着这个问题，学习了毛主席的《关于健全党委制》和《党委会的工作方法》。越读越觉得亲切，心里一下子亮堂起来。毛主席说：“不懂得和不了解的东西要问下级，不要轻易表示赞成或反对。”我却主观武断，个人意见第一。毛主席要我们“学会‘弹钢琴’”，我却眉毛胡子一齐抓，忙得不可开交。毛主席说：“集体领导和个人负责，二者不可偏废。”我却包揽一切，不实行集体领导。怪不得工作没有做好，原来是我没按照毛主席的指示办事。
    根子找到了，我又反复征求了各个支部委员的意见。张振江说：“过去工作你抓得多，大伙商量少，委员们产生了依赖思想，碰到想不通的事干着不积极，提意见又怕碰一鼻子灰，工作七拧八挣没有搞好。”孙树和说：“我是大队长，生产本来应当我负责，可是有些事我头里刚安排了，后头你给推翻了，生产队长们说我是挂牌的，你是主事的，我就干脆不问了。”听着大伙的意见，想着毛主席的教导，我说：“这些事全怨我瞎头子，今后坚决改。”
    根据大伙的意见，支部除民主制订和健全了会议制度以外，遵照集体领导和个人负责相结合的原则，支委们进行了分工。重大问题集体研究，职权范围以内的问题自行处理。分工以后，委员谁管什么责任明确了，工作积极主动了。从此千斤担子众人挑，凡事该谁管的谁管，真是事事有着落，样样有人管，支委会拧成了一股绳，充分发挥了集体领导作用。这样，我也就从烦琐的事务圈子里解放出来，有充分的时间抓政治思想工作了。
