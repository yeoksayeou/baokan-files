	The Soviet revisionists have been eagerly accommodating, and the U.S. imperialists have been vigorously courting them. On October 13, U.S. President Johnson made a statement, boasting that his recent meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko was "beneficial and fruitful."

	He also stated that during the meeting, he had invited Soviet leaders to visit the United States, indicating that the pace of U.S.-Soviet collusion is accelerating.

	At a press conference on the 13th, someone asked Johnson whether he was more optimistic about the further improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations after his recent meeting with Gromyko. Johnson replied that he was an "optimist" regarding U.S.-Soviet relations. He said, "I feel that our meeting went very well," and "I believe that this meeting was fruitful, and I believe that this meeting will yield results."

	At the press conference, Johnson announced that during the meeting, he had expressed to Gromyko, "We welcome the leaders of your country to visit our country."

	He emphasized, "It is important that we (the two countries) understand and respect each other."

	In recent times, especially since the U.S. used the United Nations General Assembly as an opportunity to carry out its "bombing halt" deception in the Vietnam issue, the Johnson administration's courting of the Soviet revisionist leadership has become increasingly blatant. The U.S. and the Soviet Union have been colluding closely on many issues, and their relationship has become increasingly warm.

	U.S. bourgeois reactionary newspapers have been jubilant about the rapid development of U.S.-Soviet collusion. The New York Times published an editorial on the 11th about the Johnson-Gromyko meeting, saying, "There is obviously a subtle and important discussion going on between the United States and the Soviet Union... This discussion has at least warmed the atmosphere." Earlier, the Christian Science Monitor published an article stating, "Johnson's efforts to achieve a high degree of reconciliation with Moscow have now reached a critical moment."

	The Associated Press also reported that due to "Russia's new willingness to improve relations becoming increasingly clear," the Johnson-Gromyko meeting "has unusual importance."

    苏修百般迎合　美帝竭力拉拢
    约翰逊宣布邀请苏联领导人访美
    新华社十四日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十三日发表谈话，宣扬几天前他同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的会谈“有助益，有收获”。
    他还表示，在会谈中已经邀请苏联领导人访问美国，这表明美苏加紧勾结的步子迈得越来越大。
    在十三日的一次记者招待会上，有人问约翰逊，他在最近同葛罗米柯会谈后，对美苏关系的进一步改善是否更加乐观。约翰逊在回答时表示，他对美苏关系是一个“乐观主义者”。他说：“我感到我们的这次会晤进行得很好”，“我认为，这次会谈是有成果的，我相信，这次会谈将会产生结果。”
    约翰逊在记者招待会上宣布，他在会谈中已经向葛罗米柯表示：“我们欢迎你们国家的领导人来我国访问。”
    他强调说：“重要的是，我们（美苏两国）相互谅解、彼此尊重。”
    最近以来，特别是美国利用联合国大会开会时机在越南问题上大搞“停炸诱和”的阴谋活动以来，约翰逊政府对苏联修正主义领导集团的拉拢越来越露骨，美苏在许多问题上都在加紧勾结，打得火热。
    美国资产阶级反动报刊对美苏勾结的大步发展普遍表现兴高采烈。《纽约时报》十一日就约翰逊—葛罗米柯会谈发表社论说：“美国和苏联之间显然在进行微妙而重要的讨论……这种讨论至少已经使气氛温暖起来了。”在这以前，《基督教科学箴言报》发表文章说：“约翰逊争取同莫斯科取得很大程度的和解的运动，现在已经到了关键时刻”。
    美联社在一篇报道中也说，由于“俄国愿意改善关系的新动向最近变得很明显”，约翰逊同葛罗米柯的会谈“具有不寻常的重要性”。
