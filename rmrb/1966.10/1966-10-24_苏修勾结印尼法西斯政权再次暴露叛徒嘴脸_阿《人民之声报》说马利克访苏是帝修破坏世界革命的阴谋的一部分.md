According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 23rd, the editorial department of the Albanian newspaper *The People's Voice* published an article on the 21st regarding the visit of the foreign minister of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary military regime, Malik, to the Soviet Union. The article pointed out that the collusion between the Soviet revisionist leaders and the Indonesian fascist butchers, whose hands are stained with the blood of revolutionary people and communists, has once again exposed their traitorous faces to the people of the world.

The article states that Malik's visit to Moscow is a necessary result of the close collusion between the Soviet revisionist leadership and the Indonesian reactionaries. The purpose is to further strengthen the comprehensive connections and cooperation between the Indonesian reactionaries and the Khrushchev revisionists, and to coordinate their joint actions internationally.

The article states that before Malik's visit to Moscow, the Soviet revisionists expelled the correspondent of the Indonesian Communist Party's organ, *The People's Daily*, from Moscow. This is a despicable and shameful crime committed by the Soviet revisionists, who are trying to curry favor with the Indonesian reactionaries.

The article emphasizes that the close collusion between the Khrushchev revisionists and the Indonesian reactionaries is an important part of the policy and conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries against the freedom of the people in various countries, against the world revolution, and against international security. It is directly linked to the common conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionists to sabotage the liberation struggles of the people in various countries, to force the heroic Vietnamese people to surrender, and to establish and strengthen the "encirclement" against China.

    苏修勾结印尼法西斯政权再次暴露叛徒嘴脸
    阿《人民之声报》说马利克访苏是帝修破坏世界革命的阴谋的一部分
    据新华社地拉那二十三日电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十一日就印度尼西亚右派反动军人政权的外交部长马利克访问苏联发表编辑部文章指出，苏联修正主义领导人同双手沾满革命人民和共产党人鲜血的印度尼西亚法西斯刽子手的勾结，再次在全世界人民面前暴露了他们叛徒的嘴脸。
    文章说，马利克访问莫斯科，是苏联修正主义领导集团和印度尼西亚反动派之间紧密勾结的必然结果，其目的在于进一步加强印尼反动派和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者之间的全面联系和合作，协调他们在国际上的共同行动。
    文章说，在马利克访问莫斯科的前夕，苏联修正主义者把印度尼西亚共产党机关报《人民日报》驻莫斯科记者赶走，是苏联修正主义者的卑鄙无耻的罪恶行径，他们企图借此讨好印尼反动派。
    文章强调指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者同印尼反动派的紧密勾结，是美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派反对各国人民的自由、反对世界革命和国际安全的政策和阴谋的一个重要组成部分，是与美帝国主义和苏联修正主义者妄图破坏各国人民的解放斗争、使英雄的越南人民屈膝投降以及建立和加强反对中国的“包围圈”的共同阴谋直接联系在一起的。
