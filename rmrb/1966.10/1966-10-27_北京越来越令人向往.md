Upon arriving in Beijing, we all felt a kind of excitement we had never experienced before. The storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept through the entire city. Every street and alley, every college and university, every government office and factory, was plastered with tens of millions of revolutionary big-character posters. On the streets, propaganda vehicles were constantly seen singing, performing, and broadcasting, creating a truly revolutionary atmosphere.

The Red Guards of the capital left the deepest impression on us. These young revolutionaries, armed with the Four Books and a red heart, wielded the revolutionary iron rod with all their might, charging into the old world. During our days and nights in Beijing, we witnessed the Red Guards issuing millions of declarations, truly awe-inspiring and striking fear into the hearts of enemies. Now, the Red Guards of the capital are fiercely attacking the capitalist roaders.

The Red Guards of the capital have the reddest hearts and the sharpest eyes. We saw that they also launched a fierce attack against imperialism, exposing a long-standing reactionary organization in Beijing that had been conducting espionage activities under the guise of religion—the Maria Biczuk Sisters of Charity. This organization, after liberation, used the cover of running schools to carry out a series of serious activities that endangered our national sovereignty. This time, Red Guards from more than ten schools in Beijing tore off its disguise. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards won the firm support of the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the broad revolutionary masses. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee announced the disbandment of this reactionary organization, took over the Saint Heart School run by this organization, and expelled the foreign nuns who were conducting counter-revolutionary activities. This is indeed a great relief.

Beijing, the capital of the Chinese revolution, the center of the world revolution, and the place where Chairman Mao resides, has become more beautiful and more enviable under the washing of the Cultural Revolution.

    北京越来越令人向往
    来到北京，我们都感到一种从来没有过的兴奋。无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，席卷了整个北京城。大街小巷，大专院校，机关厂矿，到处贴满了数以千万计的革命大字报。街道上，常见宣传车辆说唱讲演，放送广播，真是一派革命声势。
    首都的红卫兵给了我们最深的印象。这些革命小将们凭着雄文四卷，红心一颗，奋起革命千钧棒，向旧世界冲锋陷阵。在北京的日日夜夜里，我们目睹红卫兵发出千万张宣言书，真是气吞山河，威慑鬼神。现在，首都红卫兵战士正在向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火。
    首都的红卫兵心最红，眼最亮。我们看到，他们还大造了帝国主义的反，揭露了一个长期窃踞在北京进行特务活动的反动组织——玛利亚方济格修女会。这个修女会，在解放后披着宗教外衣，借办学为掩护，进行了一系列严重危害我国主权的特务破坏活动。这次，北京十多个学校的红卫兵撕开了它的伪装。红卫兵的革命行动获得了北京人民政府和广大革命群众的坚决支持，北京市人民委员会宣布取缔了这个反动修女会，接管了这个修女会办的圣心学校，把进行反革命活动的外国修女驱逐出境。这件事，实在是大快人心。
    北京，这个中国革命的首都，世界革命的中心，毛主席居住的地方，在文化大革命风浪的冲洗下，变得越来越美丽，越来越令人向往了。
