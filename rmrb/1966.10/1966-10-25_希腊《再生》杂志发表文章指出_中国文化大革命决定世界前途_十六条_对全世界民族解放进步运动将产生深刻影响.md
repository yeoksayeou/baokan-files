Greek "Regeneration" magazine has published an article pointing out that the Chinese Cultural Revolution determines the world's future. The "Sixteen Points" will have a profound impact on the national liberation and progressive movements around the world.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, the 23rd issue of Greek "Regeneration" magazine this year published an article stating: "Chairman Mao is the most outstanding people's leader of our time," "The Chinese Cultural Revolution has proven the boundless vitality of the socialist system, and it has also proven the blood-and-flesh relationship between the Chinese leadership and the masses, as well as the pioneering spirit of Chinese youth."

The article, titled "No Slander Can Harm the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Which Has World-Historical Significance," points out that the socialist cultural revolution is an unprecedented, bold, and profound revolution. Its purpose is to consolidate the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to provide profound socialist education to the people.

The article states: Now, international imperialism and reactionary forces in various countries have targeted New China as their main strategic objective. With the help of international revisionism, especially the leading group of its center, the Soviet Union, they directly threaten the Chinese people and their victories, thereby also threatening all nations and peoples of the world. This is because the main pillar in their struggle is People's China. Therefore, this revolution has even greater significance today.

The article points out: "The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will not only have a profound impact on China itself but also on the national liberation and progressive movements of the entire world." The article points out: "The stance taken by imperialism, reactionary forces in various countries, and revisionism towards the Cultural Revolution strongly proves that things are going well in China."

The article states that the process of the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution will determine the future of New China and the world. The broad masses of the Greek people enthusiastically welcome and support China's Cultural Revolution with great revolutionary fervor.

The article concludes: "The slander of the reactionaries cannot diminish the world-historically significant proletarian Cultural Revolution that is sweeping across the entire country like a torrent. The imperialist, reactionary, and revisionist frenzied anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people movements will surely suffer a miserable defeat. No force can stop the victorious advance of the masses."

This magazine also published in full the communiqué of the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."
