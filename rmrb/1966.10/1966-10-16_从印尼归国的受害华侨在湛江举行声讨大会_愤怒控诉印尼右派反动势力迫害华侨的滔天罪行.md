The first batch of overseas Chinese victims who returned to the country on the Guanghua ship held a rally in Zhanjiang today to denounce and condemn the fascist atrocities committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces against the overseas Chinese. Local revolutionary masses and Red Guards participated in the rally.

The returnees, one after another, recounted their personal experiences and presented irrefutable facts to angrily denounce the heinous crimes committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their brutal persecution and massacre of the overseas Chinese.

Lu Luzhen, an elderly overseas Chinese who worked as a clerk in the Simalungun region of Indonesia, denounced: "Starting on April 18, the local authorities in Simalungun, under the pretext of 'celebrating the anniversary of the establishment of the Civil Defense Corps,' organized thugs led by the local police chief to launch a frenzied persecution of the overseas Chinese. The thugs shouted anti-communist and anti-Chinese slogans while looting and destroying the property of the overseas Chinese. The violence lasted until the 20th, when the reactionary authorities in Aceh Province brought in a batch of thugs from Medan belonging to the 'KAMI' (Indonesian Student Action Union) and 'Pancasila Youth' reactionary organizations. Led by officials from the Medan court, these thugs joined forces with the Simalungun thugs to wreak havoc. Over a thousand thugs armed with sticks, iron bars, and knives swarmed into the urban and suburban areas of Simalungun, beating and kicking the overseas Chinese, and subjecting them to various forms of humiliation."

While the overseas Chinese were being subjected to this fascist persecution, the Indonesian authorities also dispatched Kuomintang spy elements from the Aceh capital to coerce and entice the refugees to betray their country and join the Kuomintang spy organization 'Loyalty Association,' which is sheltered by the Indonesian reactionaries. The Indonesian authorities publicly announced that anyone who joined the 'Loyalty Association' would have their life and property guaranteed. The broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese upheld the great spirit of the Chinese nation, united together, and bravely fought against the Indonesian reactionaries.

Subsequently, overseas Chinese from Wondama, West Aceh, Medan, Tjilatjap, Lhokseumawe, and Kuala Selangor also took the stage to denounce the anti-Chinese and discriminatory crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary authorities. Difficult woman Liu Lianying, as she recounted the ordeal of her husband being skinned and his eyes gouged out before he was killed by the Indonesian reactionaries, could not hold back her tears. Her son took the stage with his mother and together they raised their fists and shouted, "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries! We demand revenge! Blood debts must be repaid in blood!" At this moment, the entire venue was filled with indignation, and slogans such as "Down with American imperialism," "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries," and "Send our heartfelt greetings to the victims of the overseas Chinese" echoed throughout the venue.

Difficult woman Cai Wenxiu, after denouncing the ordeal of her husband being brutally killed, said: "I want to warn the Indonesian reactionaries: blood debts must be repaid in blood, the revolutionary people of Indonesia will never let you off, this blood debt will be settled one day!"

Many returnees further denounced the Indonesian reactionary government's obstruction of China's efforts to repatriate overseas Chinese, and the persecution and obstruction of overseas Chinese who voluntarily requested to return to China. In a recent statement, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs shamelessly claimed that they had been making every possible effort to ensure the smooth repatriation of overseas Chinese. Difficult man Zhang Guichang pointed out that this is a blatant lie. Patriotic overseas Chinese will not be manipulated by the Indonesian reactionaries; where there is oppression, there is resistance. To survive, we must struggle. The overseas Chinese in Pulau Tiga fought tenaciously against the Indonesian authorities. When the Indonesian government created difficulties and prevented our repatriation ships from docking, the right-wing authorities deceived us, trying to drive us to the Port of Belawan, where they would forcibly expel us. However, we insisted on waiting for the arrival of our consul to arrange our return, and we refused to leave Pulau Tiga. In the end, the Indonesian right-wing authorities had to allow our consul to go to Medan and let our ship dock at the port. Chairman Mao said that all reactionaries are paper tigers, and this is absolutely true. Our victorious return this time is the result of the patriotic overseas Chinese, inspired by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly resisting and struggling.

Difficult young female teacher Wang Suying, on behalf of the returnees, said that after returning to the country, they would study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They would actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.

Workers' representatives and Red Guards' representatives from Zhanjiang also spoke at the rally. They expressed their heartfelt greetings to the returnees and strongly condemned and protested the anti-Chinese and discriminatory atrocities committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

All the returnees unanimously adopted a denunciation letter at the rally. The denunciation letter listed the anti-Chinese, anti-communist, and anti-people crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries and expressed that all the returnees, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, would contribute their strength to build a powerful socialist motherland, to overthrow American imperialism, to oppose modern revisionism, and to oppose the reactionary forces of all countries, including the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

    从印尼归国的受害华侨在湛江举行声讨大会
    愤怒控诉印尼右派反动势力迫害华侨的滔天罪行
    据新华社湛江十五日电　第一批乘光华轮从印度尼西亚回国的受难华侨，今天在湛江市举行大会，向祖国人民和全世界人民控诉和声讨印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华排华、疯狂迫害华侨的法西斯暴行。当地的广大革命群众和红卫兵参加了大会。
    归国难侨在会上一个接一个地以自己的亲身遭遇，以大量无可辩驳的事实，愤怒控诉印度尼西亚右派反动势力残酷迫害和惨杀华侨的滔天罪行。
    原在印度尼西亚亚齐地区的司马委当店员的老华侨罗鹿珍控诉说：今年四月十八日开始，司马委地方当局以“庆祝民防部队成立周年纪念”为名，由当地的宪兵队长组织暴徒对华侨进行了疯狂的迫害。暴徒们一面狂呼反共反华口号，一面大肆抢劫、破坏华侨的财物。暴行延续到二十日，亚齐省反动当局又从美伦调来了一批属于“卡比”（印度尼西亚学生统一行动组织）和“潘查希拉青年”两个反动组织的暴徒。这些暴徒在美伦地方法院官员的带领下，和司马委的暴徒结伙逞凶。一千多暴徒拿着棍棒、铁条、刀子等凶器，涌进司马委的市区和郊区，见了华侨就拳打脚踢，百般侮辱。
    在华侨受到上述法西斯迫害的同时，印度尼西亚当局又指使来自亚齐首府的蒋帮特务分子胁迫、诱骗难侨背叛祖国，加入受到印度尼西亚反动派庇护的蒋匪特务组织“效忠会”。印度尼西亚当局公开宣布：谁加入了“效忠会”，就保证他生命财产的安全。广大爱国华侨坚持了伟大中华民族的气节，团结起来，对印尼反动派进行了英勇的斗争。
    接着，从万达亚齐、西吉利、美伦、打京岸、鹿树昆、瓜拉新邦等地回来的华侨，也纷纷上台声讨印度尼西亚右派反动当局反华排华的罪行。难侨妇女刘莲瑛上台控诉她丈夫被印度尼西亚反动派剥皮、挖眼后惨死的经过时泣不成声。她儿子走上台和母亲一起振臂高呼：“打倒印度尼西亚反动派！”“我们要报仇！血债一定要用血来还！”这时，全场万分激愤，“打倒美帝国主义”“打倒印度尼西亚反动派”“向受害华侨致亲切的慰问”的口号声此起彼落，响彻全场。
    难侨妇女蔡文秀控诉她丈夫惨遭杀害的经过以后说：我要警告印尼反动派：血债一定要用血来还，印尼的革命人民一定不会饶过你们，这笔血债总有一天要清算的！
    许多归国难侨进一步控诉印度尼西亚反动政府对我国的接侨工作设置重重障碍，对自愿要求回国的华侨进行重重阻碍和迫害。印度尼西亚政府外交部在不久前的一项声明中，竟然恬不知耻地说什么对我接回华侨的工作“一直在进行一切可能的努力”，要“确保”这一工作“能够顺利进行”。难侨章贵昌指出，这完全是无耻的谎言。爱国华侨是不甘受印度尼西亚反动派的摆布的，哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，要生存就要斗争。住在浮罗巴烟的难侨和印度尼西亚当局进行了不屈不挠的斗争。当印度尼西亚政府制造困难阻碍我国接侨轮船不能靠岸时，右派当局欺骗我们，想把我们赶到勿拉湾港码头上去，由他们来安排名单强行驱逐，但我们坚持等候我国的领事到来安排返国事宜，否则我们坚决不离开浮罗巴烟。最后，印度尼西亚右派当局不得不让我们的领事到棉兰，让我们的轮船进港靠码头。毛主席说，一切反动派都是纸老虎，这句话千真万确。我们这次胜利归国，是爱国华侨在战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞下，不畏强暴，坚持斗争所取得的胜利。
    难侨青年女教师王素英代表难侨表示，回国后要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，积极参加祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    湛江市工人代表和红卫兵代表，也在大会上讲话，他们对归来的难侨们表示亲切的慰问，对印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华排华的暴行表示最大的愤怒和强烈的抗议。
    全体归国难侨在会上一致通过了对印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的声讨书。声讨书历数印度尼西亚反动派反华排华、反共反人民的罪行之后，表示全体归国难侨要在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，为建设强大的社会主义祖国，为打倒美帝国主义，反对现代修正主义，反对包括印度尼西亚右派反动势力在内的各国反动派贡献自己的力量。
