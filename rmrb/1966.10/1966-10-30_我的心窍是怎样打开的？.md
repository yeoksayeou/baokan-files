In Shanghai County, Meilong Commune, Jixin Brigade, First Production Team, there is a Communist Party member named Sheng Xinqin. She often follows Chairman Mao's teachings to do ideological work, and the commune members affectionately call her "Auntie Sheng."

Auntie Sheng is an ordinary rural woman with a low level of education. She has four children and a lot of housework. In recent years, she not only insists on studying Chairman Mao's works every day but also often leads others to study. She always pays attention to spreading Mao Zedong Thought among the masses. It was under her help that I gradually changed.

Before I got married, I joined the Communist Youth League. However, after marriage, old ideas plagued my mind. I thought of myself as a "bride" and felt it was unseemly to run around to meetings. I didn't even want to participate in the organization's activities. After having two children, I completely retreated into the "small world" of the family.

Just as my individualistic thoughts were becoming more serious, Sheng Xinqin came to my house again and again to help me. She would always help with the chores while talking to me. However, I not only did not appreciate her revolutionary kindness but also grew tired of her. Once, she said to me, "Being a member of the Communist Youth League is a heavy responsibility. You should take the lead in class struggle and production struggle. The class struggle in our team is very complicated, Yongzhen, you can't just muddle through life!" Hearing this, I got angry. I thought: I neither steal nor rob; I earn my living through labor; there's nothing shameful about it! So, I said to her, "You've lectured me with big words before in the league. You're busy with your own chores, so don't bother with my affairs anymore." I even mocked her for "meddling in other people's business."

Later, I found out that she was very sad after hearing my words. However, when she looked up and saw Chairman Mao's portrait, she regained her confidence. She remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." She thought, "Yongzhen is also from a poor family. I cannot let her fall behind like this. I must unite her. Yongzhen will definitely change. The problem is that my work is not thorough enough. I must have the determination of 'moving mountains' to help her. If ten times don't work, try twenty times; if two hundred times don't work, try four hundred times. As long as I persist in helping her, she will change someday."

Sure enough, the next day she came again, and as soon as she saw me, she criticized herself, saying that she had not cared for and helped me enough. I originally thought that after our quarrel, she would not come again, but she was even more sincere and patient in helping me. Her attitude made me start thinking: "Why does she come to help me again and again? Is it for my good or to make me look bad? If it's to make me look bad, then why do I always 'hate' her and even scold her, but she is always so sincere to me?" Thinking it over, I felt that she was doing it for my good and for the good of the team. I began to believe her and even consulted her on matters. She also became more affectionate towards me, often patiently pointing out my faults. Whenever I made a little progress, she encouraged and praised me. Under her constant help and education, I began to care about the collective. The commune members saw me going to work early and coming back late, and they said, "Yongzhen has improved."

Just as my thoughts were beginning to change, the socialist education movement started. Sheng Xinqin asked me to study Chairman Mao's works with her. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." I thought, our team also has enemies without guns, and some people have been pulled over by them. If they take control, won't we poor and lower-middle peasants have to suffer the old society's hardships again? It was then that I deeply felt that in the past, I only cared about my small family and not about the revolutionary cause, truly "muddling through life"! Chairman Mao's teachings opened my eyes, and I joined Sheng Xinqin in actively participating in the great socialist education movement. Under the party organization's education and cultivation, my ideological awareness continuously improved. In April this year, I was honored to join the Communist Party.

Sheng Xinqin not only helped me progress but also helped several other young people in the team from being backward to becoming advanced. Many commune members in our team have received her great help.

    我的心窍是怎样打开的？
    山永珍
    上海县梅陇公社集心大队第一生产队，有个共产党员，名叫盛新琴。她经常按照毛主席的教导做思想工作，社员们都亲切地叫她“盛嫂嫂”。
    “盛嫂嫂”是普通的农村妇女，文化水平很低，有四个小孩，家务很忙。这几年，她不但自己坚持每天学习毛主席著作，并且经常带动别人学习，时时注意把毛泽东思想灌输到群众中去。我就是在她的帮助下，逐步转变过来的。
    我在结婚前入了团。可是结了婚，旧思想在我脑子里作怪，以为自己是个“新娘子”，东跑西跑去开会，不像样子，连团的组织生活也不想参加了。生了两个孩子以后，我就完全钻进了家庭的“小天地”里。
    正在我的个人主义思想越来越严重的时候，盛新琴一次又一次地到我家来帮助我。她总是一边帮我做活，一边和我谈心。可是，我不但不领受她这番革命情谊，反而厌烦她。有一次，她跟我说：“做一个共青团员，责任很重，要在阶级斗争和生产斗争中起带头作用。队里阶级斗争很复杂，永珍，你可不能胡里胡涂过日子啊！”听到这里，我冒火了。我想：我一不偷，二不抢，凭劳动吃饭，没啥不光荣！于是就对她说：“你讲的大道理，我过去在团里听得多了。你自己家务很忙，我的事以后不要再麻烦你了。”我还当面讽刺她“多管闲事”。
    后来我才知道，那天她听了我的话心里很难过。但是，当她抬头看见毛主席像，就又有信心了。她记起毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”她想：“永珍也是贫苦人家出身，我绝不能看她这样落后下去，一定要把她团结过来，永珍也肯定能转变过来的。问题是我的工作做得还不到家，‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民服务的精神还不够。只要我有‘愚公移山’的决心，十次不行二十次，一百次不行二百次，坚持帮助她，她总有一天会转变过来的。”
    果然，第二天她又来了，而且一见面就作自我批评，说对我关心和帮助很不够。我原来以为自己同她吵闹过，她不会再上门了，想不到她更加诚恳、耐心地帮助我。她的这种态度使我开始考虑一个问题：“她一趟一趟来帮助我，到底是为我好呢，还是要我丑？要是为了使我丑，那么为啥我对她总是‘白眼睛’（讨厌），还骂过她，她对我却总是这样热诚呢？”想来想去，觉得她是为了我好，为了队里好。我开始相信她了，有事也和她商量了。她也对我更加亲热了，常常耐心地指出我的毛病。我有了一点点进步，她鼓励我、表扬我。在她的不断帮助和教育下，我开始关心集体，社员们看到我早出工，晚收工，都说：“永珍变好了。”
    就在我思想有些转变的时候，社会主义教育运动开始了。盛新琴要我和她一起学习毛主席著作。我们反复地学习了毛主席的教导：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”我想，我们队里也有不拿枪的敌人，有的人还被不拿枪的敌人拉了过去。如果让他们掌了印把子，我们贫下中农不是又要过旧社会的苦日子吗？我这时才深切地感到，自己过去只关心小家庭，不关心革命事业，真是“胡里胡涂过日子”啊！毛主席的教导使我眼睛亮了，我就和盛新琴一起，积极投入伟大的社会主义教育运动。在党组织的教育和培养下，我的思想觉悟不断有了提高，今年四月我光荣地参加了共产党。
    盛新琴不但帮助我进步，还帮助队里好几个青年从落后变成了先进。我们队里许多社员，都得到过她很大的帮助。
