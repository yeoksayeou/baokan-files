The Chinese Red Cross delegation withdrew from the 86th Executive Committee meeting of the Red Cross Society held in Geneva on October 4, protesting that the meeting, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, disregarded repeated warnings from the Chinese Red Cross delegation before the meeting, closely collaborated with U.S. imperialism and its accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in playing a new "peace talks" trick on the Vietnam issue, and insisted on inviting the "representatives" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime's Red Cross, who represent no one, to attend the meeting as observers. The meeting discussed the so-called "restoration of peace in Vietnam" without the attendance of representatives from the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

After the meeting began, Wang Min, the head of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, solemnly declared: Only the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people. The "representatives" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime must be expelled from the meeting. Wang Min emphasized that any resolution on the Vietnam issue made by the meeting without the attendance of the legitimate representatives of the Vietnamese people is illegal and invalid. Wang Min also exposed the conspiracy of "peace talks" between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to cover up the criminal purpose of U.S. imperialism's expansion of the aggression war in Vietnam. He stressed that U.S. imperialism and all the demons and snakes serving it are doomed to failure.

The chairman of the meeting, under the pretext of not discussing politics, repeatedly obstructed the head of the Chinese delegation from speaking and rejected the Chinese delegation's just demand to expel the "representatives" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime.

Wang Min immediately strongly protested against the suppression of democracy by the meeting's chairperson, who was serving U.S. imperialism. He announced that the Chinese Red Cross delegation was withdrawing from the 86th Executive Committee meeting of the Red Cross Society.

The statement of the Chinese Red Cross delegation sternly condemned the attempt by U.S. imperialism and its accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership, to promote the "peace" trick in the Executive Committee of the Red Cross Society to cover up the U.S. war expansion plot.

The statement also pointed out: "The South Vietnamese puppet regime is a tool of U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. It has long been despised by the South Vietnamese people and represents no one. Only the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people. We firmly oppose the participation of the Red Cross of the South Vietnamese puppet regime in any capacity in the 86th Executive Committee meeting of the Society. The meeting should immediately expel it from the meeting venue."

"The Chinese Red Cross delegation solemnly declares: Since the 86th Executive Committee meeting of the Red Cross Society rejects our just demand, the Chinese Red Cross delegation decides to withdraw from this meeting. We will not be bound by any resolution passed by the meeting and will not assume any obligations. All consequences arising therefrom must be borne by U.S. imperialism and its followers."

    坚决反对红十字会协会配合美苏在越南问题上玩弄和谈阴谋
    我代表团退出红十字会协会执委会会议
    据新华社日内瓦四日电　中国红十字会代表团退出四日在日内瓦召开的红十字会协会第八十六次执行委员会会议，抗议会议在美帝国主义操纵下，不顾中国红十字会代表团在会前一再提出的警告，紧密配合美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上玩弄新的“和平谈判”骗局，坚持邀请不代表任何人的南越傀儡政权红十字会的“代表”以观察员身份参加会议，在越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线红十字会没有派代表出席会议的情况下讨论所谓在越南“恢复和平”的问题。
    会议开始后，中国红十字会代表团团长王敏严正声明：只有越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一的真正的代表，必须把南越傀儡政权的“代表”驱逐出会场。王敏强调说，在没有越南人民的真正代表出席的情况下，会议作出的有关越南问题的任何决议，都是非法的、无效的。王敏还揭露，美帝国主义及苏联修正主义勾结搞“和谈”阴谋，以掩盖美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的罪恶目的。他着重指出，美帝国主义以及为它效劳的一切牛鬼蛇神都注定要失败。
    会议主席借口不许谈政治，一再阻挠中国代表团团长发言，并且拒绝中国代表团提出的驱逐南越傀儡“代表”的正义要求。
    王敏立即强烈抗议会议主持者压制民主，为美帝国主义效劳。他宣布中国红十字会代表团退出红十字会协会第八十六次执委会会议。
    中国红十字会代表团的声明严正谴责美帝国主义和它的帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团企图在红十字会协会执行委员会上也推行“和平”骗局，以掩盖美国扩大战争的阴谋。
    声明还指出：“南越傀儡政权是美帝国主义侵略越南的工具。它早已被越南南方人民所唾弃，它不代表任何人。只有越南南方民族解放阵线才是越南南方人民唯一的真正的代表。我们坚决反对南越傀儡政权的红十字会以任何身份参加协会第八十六次执委会会议。会议应立即把它驱逐出会场。”
      “中国红十字会代表团庄严声明：红十字会协会第八十六次执委会既然拒绝我们的正义要求，中国红十字会代表团决定退出这次会议。对会议通过的决议，我们将不受任何约束，不承担任何义务。由此而引起的一切后果，必须由美帝国主义及其追随者承担。”
