In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the Red Guards, with their daring spirit of thinking, speaking, acting, and revolutionizing, have swept away all ghosts and monsters, breaking the four olds and establishing the four news. In a short period, they have given a thorough cleansing to the mud and filth left over from the old society.

They are right, they are doing well, and they are doing it thoroughly!

I am fifty-six years old this year. I started working in a bathhouse as an apprentice at the age of fourteen. In the old society, the bathhouse was the most despised profession. After liberation, I transformed from a "stinky foot masseur" into a foot disease technician, treating various foot diseases for the working people. I was also elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, participating in the management of state affairs. However, there are still many remnants of the old society and untransformed bourgeois elements who continue to view us with old eyes, demanding that we serve them as we did in the past. This is very unreasonable. I have repeatedly represented the workers to the former Beijing Municipal Committee, requesting the cancellation of services specifically for bourgeois lords, but these requests were not taken seriously. Isn't this strange? No, because they are representatives of the bourgeoisie, how could they accept our opinions?

In this storm of the proletarian cultural revolution, the Red Guards have acted swiftly and decisively. In just a few days, they have solved problems that have lingered for many years—things like massages, foot rubs, strange hairstyles, and peculiar clothing—all have been swept away. Today, the streets and alleys of Beijing have a new look: decayed shop names and street names have been changed to revolutionary names; walls and windows are filled with portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao; on the streets and in vehicles, songs praising our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, can be heard everywhere. It is truly a thriving scene of proletarian revolution!

These days, I often get so excited that I can't sleep. I have thought about many things, and I am filled with hope and confidence for the future of our country because of this generation of successors. The significance of this proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is indeed profound.

We old workers in the service industry have all come from the old society, and it is inevitable that we have been tainted, to some extent, by the dust of the old society. This cultural revolution is a revolution that touches the soul. Breaking the superficial four olds is easy, but breaking the four olds in thought is difficult, and breaking the four olds in thought is the most fundamental. If the four olds in thought are not broken, then good and bad will be indistinguishable, and the ability to resist the invasion of dust will be lost. To break the four olds in thought, one must seriously study the works of Chairman Mao and use Chairman Mao's words to examine one's own actions. Only in this way can one's thoughts be continuously revolutionized, and only then can this proletarian cultural revolution be carried through to the end.

    从思想上破“四旧”
    全国人民代表大会代表北京曙光浴池脚病技师  安起
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵小将以敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢于革命的精神，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，破“四旧”，立“四新”，在短短的时间里，把旧社会遗留的污泥浊水来了一个大冲刷。
    他们干得对，干得好，干得痛快！
    我今年五十六岁，从十四岁就进澡堂子当学徒。在旧社会，澡堂是最被人看不起的行业。解放后，我从一个“臭修脚的”变成了脚病技师，为劳动人民治疗各种脚病。我还当选为全国人民代表大会代表，参加了管理国家的大事。但是，也还有不少旧社会的残渣余孽、没有改造好的资产阶级分子，仍然以老眼光看待我们，要我们像过去一样地侍候他们，这是很不合理的。我曾经代表职工向前北京市委多次提出意见，要求取消专为资产阶级老爷们服务的项目，但是没有受到重视。这不有些奇怪吗？不，因为他们就是资产阶级的代表，这些人怎么可能接受我们的意见呢？
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命的风暴中，红卫兵小将们，雷厉风行，几天工夫就把多少年解决不了的问题，什么搓澡、捏脚那一套，什么怪发型、奇装异服，都给它来个一扫光。今天的北京城街头巷尾面貌一新：腐朽的店名、街名改换成具有革命意义的名称；墙壁上、橱窗里，到处都可以看到毛主席画像、毛主席语录；走在路上、坐到车里，到处可以听到歌颂我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的歌曲。真是一派兴旺的无产阶级革命景象啊！
    这些天来，我经常兴奋得睡不着觉。我想了很多事，想到我们有了这样一代接班人，使我对祖国的未来充满了希望和信心。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命的意义实在太深远了。
    我们服务行业的老职工，都是从旧社会走过来的，在我们的身上，不可避免地或多或少地沾染上旧社会的灰尘。这场文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命。破形式上的“四旧”易，破思想上的“四旧”难，而破思想上的“四旧”又是最根本的。思想上的“四旧”不破，就会香臭不分，就会失去抵抗灰尘入侵的能力。要破思想上的“四旧”，就要认真学习毛主席著作，用毛主席的话来检验自己的言行。只有这样才能使自己的思想不断革命化，才能真正把这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
