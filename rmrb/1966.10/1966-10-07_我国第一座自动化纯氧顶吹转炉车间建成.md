Workers in Shanghai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have created another heroic feat. They have built the country's first automated pure oxygen top-blown converter shop in just three months during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have also produced the first batch of high-quality steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 6th – The heroic workers of Shanghai, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have, in a short span of three months, rapidly and with high quality, built the country's first pure oxygen top-blown converter shop using new technology and automation. This is another heroic feat created by the heroic Shanghai working class during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On the morning of September 6th, the newly built pure oxygen top-blown converter in this shop poured out its first batch of high-quality steel. Workers gathered in front of the furnace, pasting a sign that read "Anti-Imperialism, Anti-Revisionism, Steel of Pride" on the furnace. They beat drums and gongs, enthusiastically celebrating another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, celebrating the double victory of the Cultural Revolution and production.

The pure oxygen top-blown converter is an advanced steelmaking technology that emerged in the 1960s. Using a pure oxygen top-blown converter for steelmaking is faster and far surpasses the general converter. It not only can smelt steel grades that ordinary converters cannot, but it can also replace open-hearth furnaces to smelt alloy steel and replace electric furnaces to smelt some high-grade steel. Its construction investment is far less than that of open-hearth furnaces, and its production cost is lower than that of general side-blown converters, open-hearth furnaces, and electric furnaces. Adopting this new technology can also recover coke gas and dust for comprehensive utilization by the chemical industry to produce fertilizers and chemical raw materials; it can also recover iron oxide slag as a raw material for blast furnace ironmaking. This turns harm into benefit, is beneficial to environmental hygiene, and avoids damage to crops around the factory. Therefore, the emergence of the pure oxygen top-blown converter is regarded as a major technological revolution in the world steel industry.

The pure oxygen top-blown converter shop in Shanghai was built by the workers in a quick, good, and cheap manner and has reached an advanced world level. It has two distinctive features: First, it adopts the latest technology with a high degree of automation. From charging, smelting to tapping, it is fully automatically controlled; second, the entire project was designed, equipment manufactured, and installed by China itself. All mechanical, electrical equipment, instruments, electronic components, and materials used are domestically produced. The completion of this project sets a model for China to further develop this new steelmaking technology in a quick, good, and cheap manner.

This shop started construction on June 1st, the day the People's Daily published the editorial "Sweep Away All Monsters and Demons," and by September 6th, the day before the People's Daily published the editorial "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," the first furnace had smelted out the first batch of steel. Throughout the process, the workers grasped revolution and production with one hand each, fighting bravely on both the spiritual and material fronts. Relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, they criticized anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought rightist elements and bourgeois academic "authorities." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the strongest driving force for production development, and the wisdom and creativity of the working masses have been fully brought into play. They have shown with their actions that the working masses are not only the main force of the Cultural Revolution but also the pioneers in scaling the heights of science and technology. They dare to think, dare to do, dare to innovate, and dare to make revolution, breaking through foreign frameworks and dogmas, and with the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, they have blazed a trail for the development of pure oxygen top-blown converter steelmaking in the Chinese style.

At the most intense time of the construction and installation of the pure oxygen top-blown converter shop, it was the hottest season Shanghai had seen in years. The workers, carrying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," remembered Mao's teachings of "Resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory," and persisted in welding for several hours in the hot and stuffy gas tank. At the most intense time of the concrete pouring for the furnace, the workers, inspired by Mao's teachings of "carrying forward the spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, daring to get tired, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," worked day and night, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and completed the task ahead of schedule. The workers proudly said: We want to use the fact that we have quickly built the pure oxygen top-blown converter to show the world that the Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most resolute and thorough revolutionaries. We are not only good at smashing the old world but also good at quickly building a brand-new new world with Mao Zedong Thought!

The workers regarded the rapid construction of the pure oxygen top-blown converter shop as a serious class struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, a struggle for time and speed. On the construction site, they had to demolish old buildings, build new ones, and install furnace bodies, instruments, and smoke gas purification and recovery devices, etc., with numerous tasks. Under the unified command of the construction command department, from the air to the ground, they adopted three-dimensional cross-operation, with all projects progressing simultaneously, presenting a revolutionary scene of all-round great leap forward. Workers, cadres, technical personnel, and PLA soldiers, with their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the class enemies, fought bravely at their respective posts. The PLA soldiers responsible for blasting the old concrete foundation proposed: "We must blast the old foundation like we blasted the 'Three Family Village'!" The machine tool workers said: "Every cut we make is peeling off a layer of skin from the imperialists and modern revisionists!" They boosted the morale of the Chinese working class and crushed the arrogance of the imperialists, modern revisionists, and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities." To build such a furnace, from design, equipment manufacturing to construction and installation, capitalist countries need several years; the Shanghai workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought only needed more than ten months, and the construction and installation took only three and a half months to complete.

The completion of the pure oxygen top-blown converter shop is a brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy." More than 150 factories, schools, and research institutions in Shanghai participated in this great battle. Workers, revolutionary cadres, and technical personnel from various relevant departments, in strategy, despised the "enemy," but in tactics, took the "enemy" seriously. To seize the overall victory, under the unified command of the construction command department, they completed their respective tasks on time, in quantity, and in quality. (Photo attached)

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海工人又创英雄业绩
    我国第一座自动化纯氧顶吹转炉车间建成
    纯氧顶吹转炉是六十年代的先进炼钢技术。上海工人在无产阶级文化大革命中，抓革命，促生产，仅用三个月时间就多快好省地建成这个车间，并炼出了第一炉优质钢。
    新华社上海六日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的上海工人，抓革命，促生产，用短短三个月的时间，高速度、高质量地建成了我国第一个采用新技术和自动化的纯氧顶吹转炉车间。这是英雄的上海工人阶级，在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，创造的又一英雄业绩。
    九月六日清晨，这个车间新建成的一个纯氧顶吹转炉，放出第一炉优质钢水。聚集在炉前的工人把用大红纸写的“反帝反修争气炉”贴在炉子旁。工人们敲锣打鼓，热烈庆贺毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，庆贺文化大革命和生产双胜利。
    纯氧顶吹转炉是六十年代大量发展起来的先进的炼钢技术。用纯氧顶吹转炉炼钢，速度快，远远超过一般的转炉。它不仅可以冶炼普通转炉不能炼的钢种，还可以代替平炉冶炼合金钢和代替电炉冶炼一部分高级钢种；而它的建设投资远比平炉少，生产成本也比一般侧吹转炉、平炉和电炉低。采用这种新技术，还可以回收煤气和烟尘，供化学工业综合利用，生产化肥和化工原料；还可回收氧化铁屑，作为高炉的炼铁原料。这样就变有害为有利，有利于环境卫生，避免了对工厂周围农作物的损害。因此，纯氧顶吹转炉的出现，被看作是世界炼钢工业的一项重大技术革命。
    上海这个纯氧顶吹转炉车间是工人们多快好省地建设起来的，具有世界先进水平。它有两个鲜明的特点：第一，采用了最新技术，自动化程度高。从加料、冶炼到出钢，完全是自动控制的；第二，整个工程完全是我国自己设计、自己制造设备、自己安装的。所用的机械、电气设备、仪器仪表、电子元件、材料等，全部是国产的。这个工程的建成，为我国多快好省地进一步发展这一炼钢新技术树立了样板。
    这个车间，从六月一日《人民日报》发表社论《横扫一切牛鬼蛇神》那一天动工，到九月六日，即《人民日报》发表《抓革命，促生产》社论的前一天，第一个炉子冶炼出了第一炉钢水。在整个过程中，工人群众一手抓革命，一手抓生产，在精神和物质两条战线上奋勇作战。工人们靠伟大的毛泽东思想，批判反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的资产阶级右派分子，批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”。无产阶级文化大革命是推动生产发展的最强大的推动力，工人群众的聪明才智更充分地发挥出来了。他们用自己的行动表明，工人群众既是文化大革命的主力军，也是攀登科学技术高峰的闯将。他们敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢革命，大破洋框框、洋教条，以无产阶级彻底的革命精神，闯出了一条中国式的发展纯氧顶吹转炉炼钢的技术道路。
    纯氧顶吹转炉车间建设安装工程最紧张的时候，正是上海历年罕见的持续高温季节。工人们身上带着《毛主席语录》，牢记着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，在又闷又热的煤气罐里，坚持几小时的焊接。炉子浇灌混凝土工程最紧张的时候，工人们用毛主席教导的“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”来激励自己，夜以继日，不怕苦，不怕累，提前完成了任务。工人们自豪地说：我们就是要用多快好省地建成纯氧顶吹转炉的事实向全世界表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人，是最坚决、最彻底的革命派，我们不仅勇于砸烂旧世界，也善于用毛泽东思想迅速建设一个崭新的新世界！
    工人们把迅速建成纯氧顶吹转炉车间，看作是和帝国主义、现代修正主义争时间、比速度的一场严重的阶级斗争。安装工地上，既要拆除旧厂房，建设新厂房，又要安装炉体、仪器仪表以及烟气净化回收装置等等，头绪纷繁。工人们在工程指挥部的统一指挥下，从空中到地下，采取立体交叉作业，各项工程同时并进，整个现场呈现出一派热气腾腾的全面大跃进的革命景象。工人、干部、技术人员和解放军指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，在各自岗位上奋勇战斗。担任爆破旧混凝土基础的解放军战士提出：“要像捣毁‘三家村’一样，捣毁旧基础！”制造设备的机床工人说：“我们每刨一刀，就是多剥帝国主义者、现代修正主义者一层皮！”他们长了中国工人阶级的志气，灭了帝国主义者、现代修正主义者以及资产阶级反动技术“权威”的威风。建成这样的炉子，从设计、设备制造到施工安装，资本主义国家需要几年时间；用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海工人，只用了十个多月时间，其中建筑施工安装仅仅用三个多月就完成了。
    纯氧顶吹转炉车间的建成，是毛主席“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”伟大战略思想的辉煌胜利。上海共有一百五十多家工厂、学校、研究单位参加了这场大会战。各有关部门的工人、革命干部和技术人员，在战略上藐视“敌人”，在战术上重视“敌人”，为了夺取全局的胜利，在施工指挥部的统一指挥下，按质、按量、按时完成了自己所担负的任务。（附图片）
