	Ah! It is he, Chairman Mao, the most outstanding warrior against imperialism and old and new colonialism,
	Ah! It is he, the true successor of Marx and Lenin, the great defender of world peace and freedom,
	Ah! It is he, the friend of the poor, the excellent son of the people,
	Ah! It is he, Chairman Mao, the source of strength for the oppressed peoples of all countries, whose great thoughts are the most powerful and reliable weapons of struggle in our time,
	Ah! Chairman Mao, you were born to serve the people of the whole world, you are their most loyal and conscious excellent servant,
	Ah! Chairman Mao, you are unique in my heart, you are not only a great philosopher of our time, but also a great warrior in the history of contemporary revolution,
	Ah! Great Mao Zedong, great genius, the giant who makes American imperialism tremble with fear,
	Ah! The greatest of the great, glory to you!
	Wishing you happiness, wishing you eternal life!

Note: This poem was written by Langbo'er to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    向毛主席致敬
    刚果（布）小学教师　朗贝尔
    啊！正是他，毛主席，反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的最杰出的战士，
    啊！正是他，马克思和列宁的真正继承者，世界和平和自由的伟大捍卫者，
    啊！正是他，穷人的朋友，人民的优秀儿子，
    啊！正是他，毛主席，各国被压迫人民的力量的源泉，他的伟大思想是当代最强大和最可靠的战斗武器，
    啊！毛主席，您为全世界人民服务而生，您是他们最忠诚和最自觉的优秀勤务员，
    啊！毛主席，您在我心中是举世无双的，您不仅是当代伟大的哲学家，而且是当代革命史上的伟大战士，
    啊！伟大的毛泽东，伟大的天才，使美帝国主义胆战心惊的巨人，
    啊！最最伟大的人啊，光荣属于您！
    祝您幸福，祝您万寿无疆！注：这首诗是朗贝尔为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年而写的。
