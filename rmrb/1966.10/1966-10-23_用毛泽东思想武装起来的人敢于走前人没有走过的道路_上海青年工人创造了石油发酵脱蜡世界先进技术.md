People armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to tread paths uncharted by their predecessors. Shanghai's young workers have created a world-leading technology for microbial oil dewaxing.

Oil microbial dewaxing is a new technology that began to develop internationally in the 1960s. Some capitalist countries have been researching it for 50 to 60 years, and even now, only a few countries are in the intermediate trial stage. Shanghai's young workers and technical personnel have completed in just over five years what capitalist countries have not been able to achieve in several decades.

	New China News Agency, Shanghai, October 22 — Shanghai workers and scientific and technical personnel, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to tread paths uncharted by their predecessors and dare to scale peaks unclimbed by their predecessors. Young scientific and technical workers from an institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and young workers from relevant Shanghai factories have collaborated to complete in just over five years what capitalist countries have been researching for several decades but have not yet achieved. They have created the latest technology for oil microbial dewaxing.

	This new technology has now been put into production. Factory intermediate trials have proven that high-grade, low-congealing-point oil products refined using this new technology far surpass the quality of similar American oil products. In terms of utilizing the yeast produced during oil microbial dewaxing, China has also achieved remarkable results.

	This new technology created by relevant Shanghai units has opened up a fast, efficient, good, and economical path for utilizing China's abundant oil resources to produce high-grade oil products and high-protein yeast.

	Some capitalist countries have been researching this technology for 50 to 60 years, but even now, only a few countries are in the intermediate trial stage. Relevant Shanghai units began researching oil microbial dewaxing in May 1961. They were determined to strive for progress, catch up, and surpass Western capitalist countries in the shortest time possible. They dared to think, dared to act, and dared to revolutionize. By 1963, they had achieved initial results and determined the direction of using microorganisms to dewax and refine oil. They then pressed on, spending over two more years to complete the intermediate trials. According to available materials, the largest oil microbial dewaxing fermentation tank in the world is 15,000 liters, while Shanghai's fermentation tank is several times larger.

	The entire trial process of this new technology was a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works by relevant units' young scientific and technical workers and workers. They drew clear directions and gained immense strength from Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "On Practice," "Serve the People," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They said: The people of Daqing, relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, have created the world's latest level in oil extraction technology, enabling China to remove the "foreign oil" label; we have the great Mao Zedong Thought, and we will definitely scale the peak of using microorganisms to refine oil. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are doing what our predecessors have never done, a most glorious and great cause. Our goal must be achieved. Our goal can be achieved." What the Western bourgeoisie can do, the Chinese working class can do; what the Western bourgeoisie cannot do, the Chinese working class can definitely do. They regarded every trial and every tiny piece of work as a serious struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism for time and speed.

	The first major problem encountered in oil microbial dewaxing was finding microorganisms that could "eat wax." Among countless microorganisms, finding one that could "eat wax" was an extremely complex and meticulous task. Young scientific and technical workers from an institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, undaunted by hardship, traveled to many places, collecting nearly a hundred soil samples. With the spirit of moving mountains, they screened over a thousand microorganisms. After numerous trials, they finally found a relatively ideal microorganism that could "eat wax," solving the key problem of oil microbial dewaxing and achieving laboratory trial success. They then achieved success in expanded trials.

	The industrial intermediate trials were undertaken by over a dozen young workers, with an average age of less than 23. They had never been involved in the oil microbial industry. However, they always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, combining revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude, making significant contributions to the success of this new technology trial. In the trials, they strictly followed Chairman Mao's teachings in "On Practice." Cultivating microorganisms for oil microbial dewaxing was a very difficult problem. How to make the microorganisms grow quickly and strongly, with high "eating wax" efficiency? There were two differing opinions, and the debate was intense. They studied "On Practice" together. Chairman Mao said: "The criterion of truth is social practice." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, conducting extremely strict comparative trials based on the two differing opinions, letting practice draw the conclusion. Through their own practice, they finally explored new conditions for cultivating microorganisms, reducing the cultivation period by half.

	For example, at the beginning of the research trial, a relatively complex set of process equipment was determined. This process equipment was technically complex, consumed a lot of power, and could not be used for large-scale industrial production. The young workers participating in the industrial intermediate trials, in order to make this new technology quickly applied to production, decided to discard this set of processes. They boldly envisioned and proposed a completely new process, expanding the fermentation scale by many times. At the beginning of the trial, the congealing point of the oil products and the yield of yeast did not meet the predetermined requirements. But these young people remained undaunted. Every time they failed, they reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely, fearlessly, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They summoned their courage to overcome difficulties. They believed: Persistence is victory. They analyzed each trial's progress with veteran workers, finding the main causes of failure, taking necessary measures, and persisting in the trials. Finally, they made the yield and quality of the oil products and yeast meet the predetermined requirements.

	The fact that Shanghai's young workers and technical personnel created the new technology of oil microbial dewaxing in a short time once again proves: Mao Zedong Thought is the guide to scientific and technological research and the golden bridge to scaling scientific peaks. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, bravest, and most innovative.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人敢于走前人没有走过的道路
    上海青年工人创造了石油发酵脱蜡世界先进技术
    石油发酵脱蜡是六十年代国际上开始发展起来的新技术。有些资本主义国家研究了五六十年，直到现在，只有个别国家处于中间试验阶段。上海青年工人和科技人员仅用五年多时间，就完成了资本主义国家几十年没有办到的事。
    新华社上海二十二日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的上海工人和科学技术人员，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。中国科学院一个研究所的青年科学技术工作者和上海有关厂的青年工人，通力合作，在五年多的时间内，完成了资本主义国家花了几十年还没有办到的事，创造了石油发酵脱蜡的最新技术。
    现在这项新技术已经投入生产。经过工厂中间扩大试验证明，采用这项新技术精制出来的高级低凝点石油产品，大大超过了美国同类石油产品的质量；在石油发酵过程中对产生的酵母的利用方面，我国也取得了显著成就。
    上海有关单位创造的这项新技术，为利用我国丰富的石油资源，生产高级石油产品和高蛋白酵母，开辟了一条多、快、好、省的途径。
    这项技术，有些资本主义国家已经研究了五六十年，但是直到现在，只有个别国家处于中间试验阶段。上海有关单位的工人和科学技术工作者，从一九六一年五月才开始研究石油发酵脱蜡。他们决心奋发图强、后来居上，在最短的时间内赶上并超过西方资本主义国家。他们敢想、敢干、敢革命，一九六三年就取得了初步成果，确定了用微生物脱蜡精制石油的方向。接着，他们乘胜前进，又花了两年多时间，完成了中间扩大试验。据已知的材料，世界上现有最大的石油发酵脱蜡的发酵罐为一万五千立升，而上海的发酵罐比这要大好几倍。
    这项新技术的整个试验过程，就是有关单位青年科学技术工作者和工人们活学活用毛主席著作的过程。他们从毛主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》、《实践论》等光辉著作中，明确了前进的方向，获得了极其巨大的力量。他们说：大庆人靠伟大的毛泽东思想，在石油开采技术上创造了世界最新水平，使我国摘掉了用“洋油”的帽子；我们有伟大的毛泽东思想，也一定能攀登用微生物精制石油的技术高峰。毛主席教导我们：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。我们的目的一定要达到。我们的目的一定能够达到。”西方资产阶级能够做到的事，我们中国工人阶级能够做到；西方资产阶级做不到的事，我们中国工人阶级也一定能够做到。他们把每一个试验，每一项极细小的工作，都看作是和帝国主义、现代修正主义争时间、比速度的一场严重斗争。
    石油发酵脱蜡碰到的第一个大问题，是要找到能够“吃蜡”的微生物。而在多得难以数计的微生物中，找出一种能够“吃蜡”的微生物，这是一件极其复杂细致的工作。中国科学院一个研究所的年轻的科学技术工作者，不辞劳苦，多处奔跑，采集了近百种土样，以愚公移山的精神，筛选了上千种微生物。经过多次试验，终于找到了比较理想的能“吃蜡”的微生物，解决了石油发酵脱蜡的关键问题，取得了实验室试验成功。接着，又取得了扩大试验的成功。
    承担工业化中间试验的是十多个平均年龄还不到二十三岁的青年工人。他们从来没有接触过石油发酵工业。但是，他们时时事事牢记毛主席的教导，把敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，同严格的科学态度结合起来，在这项新技术试验成功的战斗中，作出了重大贡献。在试验中，他们严格按照毛主席在《实践论》中的教导办事。培养石油发酵脱蜡的微生物，是一个非常困难的问题。怎么使微生物长得又快、又壮，“吃蜡”效率高？有两种不同的意见，争论很激烈。他们就一起学习《实践论》。毛主席说：“真理的标准只能是社会的实践。”他们遵照毛主席的教导，按两种不同的意见进行极严格的对比试验，让实践作结论。他们通过自己的实践，终于摸索出培养微生物的新条件，使培养周期缩短了一半。
    又如，在做研究试验之初，确定了一套比较复杂的工艺设备。这种工艺设备技术复杂，耗费动力大，而且无法进行大规模的工业生产。参加工业化中间试验的青年工人们为了争取这项新技术尽快运用到生产中去，决心革掉这套工艺。他们大胆设想，提出一套崭新的工艺，并且把发酵规模扩大了许多倍。开始试验时，石油产品的凝固点和酵母的产量都没有达到预定的要求。但这些青年人毫不动摇，他们每失败一次，就重温一次毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，鼓起勇气，去战胜困难。他们相信：坚持就是胜利。他们和老工人一起仔细分析每次试验的进展，找出失败的主要原因，采取必要措施，坚持试验，最后终于使产品油和酵母的产量、质量等都达到了预定要求。
    上海青年工人和科学技术工作者，在短短的时间内创造了石油发酵脱蜡新技术的事实再一次说明：毛泽东思想是研究科学技术的指南，是攀登科学高峰的金桥。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最聪明，最勇敢，最有首创精神。
