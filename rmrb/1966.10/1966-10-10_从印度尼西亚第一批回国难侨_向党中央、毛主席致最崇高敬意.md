From the Guanghua Ship: The first batch of returnees from the Aceh region of Indonesia, upon hearing the October 8 editorial from the People's Daily titled "Warmly Welcoming the Return of Injured Overseas Chinese" over the ship's radio, were deeply moved and filled with tears of joy, cheering and jumping with excitement. They immediately sent a telegram to the beloved Party Central Committee and beloved Chairman Mao to express their highest respect.

The telegram said: We deeply feel the boundless care of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the seven hundred million people of our great motherland, which has given us boundless strength and brought us endless happiness.

The telegram said: Now we are about to return to the embrace of our compatriots in the motherland. To create a happy future together with our compatriots, we have launched a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works on the ship, responding to Chairman Mao's call to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to eliminate the "four olds" we brought from capitalist society. We pledge to the beloved Party Central Committee, beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, and our compatriots in the motherland that after returning to the motherland, we will definitely, together with the revolutionary people of the entire country, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promote the revolutionization of our thinking, and carry the socialist revolution and socialist construction through to the end.

    新华社九日讯　光华轮消息：从印度尼西亚亚齐地区第一批回国的难侨，在光华轮上从广播里听到十月八日《人民日报》社论《热烈欢迎受害侨胞回到祖国》的时候，大家激动得热泪盈眶，欢呼跳跃。他们立即打电报给敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席表示最崇高的敬意。
    电报说，我们深深地感受到我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，我们伟大的祖国七亿亲人对我们无微不至的关怀，给我们增添了无穷的力量，带来了无限的幸福。
    电报说，现在我们就要回到祖国亲人的怀抱了，为了和祖国亲人一道创造幸福的未来，我们在船上掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮，响应毛主席把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的号召，清除自己从资本主义社会带来的四旧。我们向敬爱的党中央，敬爱的毛泽东主席和祖国亲人保证，回到祖国以后，一定和全国革命人民一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设进行到底。
