The heroic county of Gò Cầu, located just 30 kilometers from Saigon, is like a sharp dagger thrust into the heart of the U.S. puppet regime's stronghold. The military and civilians of South Vietnam frequently launch attacks from here into the suburbs of Saigon, posing a significant threat to the U.S. puppet regime's nest, Saigon. For several years, U.S. puppet forces have continuously conducted "sweeps" and bombings in Gò Cầu. However, the military and civilians of Gò Cầu have repeatedly thwarted the enemy's "sweeps," annihilating a large number of American invaders. The heroic Gò Cầu stands firm like an iron wall. A small county like Gò Cầu has inflicted such heavy losses on the American invaders. No matter how many more American invaders the Johnson administration sends, they will only meet their doom in the vast ocean of people's war.

    英雄的古芝
    距离西贡只有三十公里的古芝县，是插在美伪集团统治中心的一把尖刀。越南南方军民经常从这里进入西贡市城郊打击敌人，使美伪集团的巢穴西贡受到极大的威胁。几年以来，美伪军不断对古芝进行“扫荡”、轰炸。但是，古芝军民不断粉碎敌人的“扫荡”，歼灭了大量美国侵略军。英雄的古芝，仍然像铜墙一样屹立着。一个小小的古芝县就把美国侵略者打得那么惨。约翰逊政府不论再派多少美国侵略军来，也只能在怒涛滚滚的人民战争汪洋大海里遭到灭顶之灾。
