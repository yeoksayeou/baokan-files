Chairman Mao's good worker Wei Fengying's deeds exhibition opened today in Beijing.

This exhibition is a living classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It radiates the golden light of the great Mao Zedong Thought and fully embodies the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Through Wei Fengying's countless ordinary yet great and moving deeds, the exhibition demonstrates a truth that cannot be overturned: people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, the wisest, the most morally upright, and the purest in spirit. They are the greatest fighting force, capable of creating any miracle.

During the pre-opening period, Comrades Tao Zhu, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, and Cai Chang visited the exhibition.

The exhibition consists of the following parts: "Growing Up Under the Nurture of Mao Zedong Thought," "Following Chairman Mao's Words, Never Forgetting Class Struggle," "Using Mao Zedong Thought as a Guide, Making Great Technological Innovations," "Following Chairman Mao's Teachings, Showing Extreme Enthusiasm for Comrades," "Using Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Life," and "Promoting, Learning from, and Surpassing Wei Fengying."

At the entrance of the exhibition, there is a large photograph of our great leader Chairman Mao warmly shaking hands with Wei Fengying. Wei Fengying has had the fortune of meeting Chairman Mao thirteen times. Each meeting with Chairman Mao has given her immense strength to advance, inspiring her to march forward on the path indicated by Mao Zedong Thought.

Since this year, Wei Fengying has been invited to give reports in more than thirty sessions in thirteen cities and counties, including Beijing, Chongqing, Shenyang, and Harbin. Her advanced thoughts and heroic deeds have resonated strongly among the masses, who have expressed their determination to learn from Wei Fengying and resolutely take the revolutionary path. Recently, during the pre-opening period, revolutionary masses from the capital and a large number of Red Guards and revolutionary students from various places who came to Beijing for revolutionary connections visited the exhibition. They were deeply moved by Wei Fengying's advanced deeds. After visiting the exhibition, they felt even more the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. They said: After the visit, all words boil down to one sentence: Mao Zedong Thought is a priceless treasure for destroying the old world, creating a new world, transforming old thoughts, and cultivating new thoughts.

    据新华社二十三日讯　毛主席的好工人尉凤英同志事迹展览会，今天在北京正式开幕。
    这个展览会，是一个活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想的金色光辉，充分体现了毛泽东思想的胜利。展览会通过尉凤英无数平凡而伟大的生动感人的事迹，向人们显示了一个颠扑不灭的真理：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最勇敢、最聪明的人，是道德最高尚、灵魂最纯洁的人，是最大的战斗力，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    展览会预展期间，陶铸、李富春、刘宁一、蔡畅等同志参观了展览。
    尉凤英事迹展览会由以下几部分组成：综合部分——“在毛泽东思想哺育下成长”；“听毛主席的话，念念不忘阶级斗争”；“以毛泽东思想为指针，大闹技术革新”；“按毛主席教导，对同志极端的热忱”；“用毛泽东思想统帅生活”；“宣传尉凤英，学习尉凤英，赶超尉凤英”。
    在展览会的进口处，挂着一幅我们伟大领袖毛主席同尉凤英亲切握手的大照片。尉凤英曾经十三次幸福地会见过毛主席。毛主席的每一次接见，都给了她巨大的前进力量，鼓舞她沿着毛泽东思想指明的道路奋勇前进。
    尉凤英今年以来，曾应各地邀请，先后在北京、重庆、沈阳、哈尔滨等十三个市和县作过三十多场报告。她的先进思想和英雄事迹，在广大群众中引起强烈的反响，人们纷纷表示要向尉凤英学习，坚决走革命化的道路。最近预展期间，首都革命群众、各地来京进行革命串连的大批红卫兵和革命师生，参观了展览会。他们深深地为尉凤英的先进事迹所感动。他们看了展览，更加体会到毛泽东思想的伟大。他们说：参观后，千言万语归结一句话：毛泽东思想是破坏旧世界、创建新世界，改造旧思想、培养新思想的无价法宝。（附图片）
