After watching the performances by the amateur troupes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we had tears in our eyes and our hearts couldn't calm down for a long time. We felt a surge of upward momentum throughout our bodies. What a thrilling performance!

The amateur performers of workers, peasants, and soldiers, nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have long been on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements. Many of them are outstanding workers, model community members, exemplary soldiers, and active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works. They sing about themselves, perform about themselves, and praise the heroes within their own ranks. Therefore, their performances are so profound, vivid, and natural! The heroic deeds they sing about are often experiences they have personally gone through, so their performances are so genuine and authentic! Through their own experiences and personal feelings, they passionately praise the Party and the red sun in the hearts of a billion people—the beloved leader Chairman Mao. This is the most sincere expression of their deep class sentiments, a voice from the heart. Their performances have completely renewed the look of our stage. Their successful performances inspire us, encourage us, and give us the greatest encouragement and motivation! This is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought on the cultural front, a new victory of the Mao Zedong literary and artistic line!

We are professional cultural workers. In the past, under the control and influence of Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line, we did not truly immerse ourselves among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor did we serve them well. We feel that we have let down the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have disappointed the Party's expectations of us. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we stand together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with the Red Guards, to fight against all those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, both inside and outside the institution, and to begin eliminating their influence. We urgently need to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to wholeheartedly serve them, and to serve proletarian politics.

We must humbly learn from the amateur performance troupes of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must, like them, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics in everything, and with the greatest enthusiasm, praise the great leader Chairman Mao and the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must make the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought our lifelong mission.

    虚心向工农兵学习
    中国东方红话剧院  林克欢　夏志新  沈及明　赵云声
    看完工农兵业余演出队的演出，我们眼边挂着泪花，心头很久不能平静，浑身感到有一股向上的热力。这是多么激动人心的演出呵！
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的工农兵业余演员，长期战斗在三大革命的最前线。他们许多人，在生活中就是优秀工人，模范社员，五好战士，学习毛主席著作的积极分子。他们唱自己，演自己，歌颂自己队伍中的英雄人物，所以他们演的是那样深刻，生动，自然！他们歌颂的英雄事迹，很多都是他们亲身经历的，所以他们演的是那样朴实，逼真！他们通过自己的经历和切身的感受，满怀激情地歌颂党，歌颂亿万人民心中的红太阳——敬爱的领袖毛主席。这是他们深厚的阶级感情的最真诚的表现，是发自肺腑的心声。他们的演出，使我们的舞台面貌焕然一新。他们成功的演出，振奋着我们，激励着我们，给了我们最大的鼓舞和鞭策！这是毛泽东思想在文艺战线上的新的胜利，这是毛泽东文艺方向的新的胜利！
    我们是专业文艺工作者，过去在周扬反革命修正主义文艺路线的控制和影响下，没有真正深入工农兵，没有很好地为工农兵服务。我们感到对不起工农兵，辜负了党对我们的期望。在这场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，与广大工农兵群众、红卫兵站在一起，向院内外一切走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级的反动“权威”进行了斗争，开始清除他们的影响。我们迫切地要求与工农兵相结合，全心全意为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务。
    我们一定要虚心地向工农兵业余演出队学习，一定要像他们那样高高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，处处突出政治，用最大的热情歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂工农兵英雄人物，把宣传毛泽东思想当做我们毕生的战斗任务。
