A delegation led by Vice Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Blackden Junnan, and Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Miyazaki Seiken, departed Guangzhou by train this morning, heading back to their country via Shenzhen. On the eve of their departure, Blackden Junnan spoke to our reporter, enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He also expressed his determination to continue promoting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China upon his return.

Blackden Junnan said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the world's people in their struggle against imperialism and for national liberation. Chairman Mao is in excellent health, which is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world."

Blackden Junnan said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has brought the socialist revolution to a new stage, which is a great innovation of Mao Zedong Thought. The Cultural Revolution in China aims to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, sweeping away old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and establishing new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits. To build socialism, one must follow the path of the Cultural Revolution. The Soviet Union, which did not carry out the Cultural Revolution, has produced revisionism. China's socialist construction has created a path that no other country has taken, and the Cultural Revolution is the creative practice of Chinese socialism."

He further said, "The Cultural Revolution in China is carried out according to Mao Zedong Thought. Seven hundred million Chinese people have united under Mao Zedong Thought, as united as one person, listening to Chairman Mao's words and acting according to his instructions, sweeping away old ideas, and establishing new customs. The Red Guards have participated in the Cultural Revolution and achieved great results."

He said, "This year's National Day activities in Beijing reflected the thoughts of the Cultural Revolution. The magnificent parade of 1.5 million people expressed the Chinese people's determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and their strong will to oppose the aggression of American imperialism and to oppose revisionism."

In discussing the development of the Japan-China friendship movement, he said, "No matter how the American imperialists and their followers try to sabotage Japan-China friendship, or how internal forces obstruct Japan-China friendship exchanges, Japan-China friendship exchanges are unstoppable, and the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China is ever-developing. Recently, 52 prominent figures from various sectors in China issued a statement supporting the statement by prominent figures from various sectors in Japan on promoting Japan-China friendship, which greatly boosted our morale. He said, "After returning to Japan, I will resolutely fight against the forces that obstruct Japan-China exchanges and strive to further promote the development of friendship between the peoples of Japan and China." He emphasized that, under the current situation, the peoples of Japan and China must unite closely to fight against their common enemy, American imperialism.

When the delegation left Guangzhou, Chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Chairman of the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Guangzhou Branch, Zeng Sheng, and relevant officials, as well as Japanese peace activist Nishizonoji Koichi, who was in Guangzhou, went to the station to see them off.

    黑田寿男欢呼中国红卫兵取得巨大战果
    七亿中国人民用毛泽东思想统一起来
    要建设社会主义就必须走文化大革命的道路
    新华社广州十六日电　由日本日中友协副会长黑田寿男和日中友协理事长宫崎世民率领的日中友协代表团，今晨乘火车离开广州经深圳回国。黑田寿男在回国前夕对本社记者发表谈话，热烈赞颂毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，并且表示回国后要继续为促进日中两国人民的友好而努力。
    黑田寿男说，毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是领导全世界人民反对帝国主义斗争和争取民族解放的伟大领袖。毛主席非常健康，这是对世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞。
    黑田寿男说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命使得社会主义革命发展到了一个新阶段，这是毛泽东思想的创举。中国进行文化大革命就是要在意识形态上灭资兴无，横扫旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。要建设社会主义，就必须走文化大革命的道路。苏联由于没有进行文化大革命，就产生了修正主义。中国进行社会主义建设，创造了别国所没有走的道路，文化大革命就是中国社会主义创造性的实践。
    他还说，中国文化大革命是根据毛泽东思想进行的。七亿中国人民用毛泽东思想统一起来，团结得像一个人一样，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，横扫旧思想，树立新风尚。红卫兵参加文化大革命，取得了巨大的战果。
    他说，今年北京的国庆活动体现了文化大革命的思想。雄伟的一百五十万人的游行队伍表达了中国人民要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心，以及他们反对美帝国主义侵略和反对修正主义的坚强意志。
    他在谈到日中友好运动的发展时说，不管美帝国主义及其追随者怎样破坏日中友好，或者是我们运动内部出现阻挠日中友好来往的势力，但日中友好来往是任何力量也无法阻挡的，日中两国人民的友好是越来越发展的。中国各界五十二位知名人士最近发表声明，支持日本各界知名人士关于促进日中友好的声明，这大大鼓舞了我们的斗志。他说，我回日本后，要同阻挠日中友好往来的势力作坚决的斗争，为进一步推动日中两国人民友好的发展而努力。他强调说，在目前的形势下，日中两国人民必须紧密团结起来，为反对共同敌人美帝国主义而斗争。
    在代表团离开广州时，中日友好协会会长廖承志，中国人民对外友好协会广州分会代会长曾生和各有关方面的负责人，以及正在广州的日本和平人士西园寺公一，前往车站欢送。
