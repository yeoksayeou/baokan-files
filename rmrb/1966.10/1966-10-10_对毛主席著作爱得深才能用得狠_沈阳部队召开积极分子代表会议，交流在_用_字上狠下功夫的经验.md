The People's Liberation Army Shenyang Military Region recently held a conference of representatives of activists who study Chairman Mao's works. The conference widely exchanged experiences in the intensive study and application of Chairman Mao's works, especially in the aspect of "use." The representatives said: There are a thousand or even ten thousand experiences in studying, but the most fundamental one is to have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Only by loving Chairman Mao's works deeply can one use them effectively, and only by using them effectively can one love them even more deeply.

The Shenyang Military Region, in implementing the study of Chairman Mao's works, has prominently demonstrated the spirit of intensity. First, the leadership has been intense in leading by example, setting up models, and promoting experiences. Second, everyone has been intense in applying the works to transform their worldviews, engage in class struggle, and combat selfish and impure thoughts. The intense implementation has made the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works increasingly better, especially since Comrade Lin Biao proposed the five principles of emphasizing politics, the situation has become even better. Old models have new developments, and new models have reached new heights. A lively scene has emerged where "old comrades" lead "new comrades," "new comrades" inspire "old comrades," headquarters lead units, units inspire headquarters, superiors lead subordinates, subordinates inspire superiors, cadres lead family members, and family members inspire cadres. A large number of advanced units in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have emerged, as well as a large number of "old comrades," "new comrades," and "female comrades." The comrades attending this conference are outstanding representatives of the "four large groups."

The experiences introduced at the meeting show that the intensity in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works comes from an unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives said: "Father and mother are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao," "Mao Zedong Thought is connected to our flesh and blood, heart to heart," "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the reddest sun in our hearts," "Mao Zedong Thought is the root of revolution, the soul of life, the ocean of wisdom, the source of strength, the weapon of struggle, and the guide to action." Some representatives, who were illiterate when they joined the army, were able to quickly overcome the difficulty of not knowing how to read and directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought. They relied on their unlimited love for Chairman Mao and their deep class feelings towards Chairman Mao's works. They held Chairman Mao's works in one hand and a dictionary in the other, learning word by word and memorizing point by point, studying culture for the sake of studying Chairman Mao's works, seizing time, overcoming all difficulties, and rapidly growing under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. They realized that whether one can grasp Mao Zedong Thought does not depend on the level of education but on the depth of feelings towards Chairman Mao's works. Whether one uses them intensely depends on how deeply one feels about Chairman Mao's works. A soldier from the Engineering Corps, Yin Yangchun, from a poor family, overcame the difficulties of not speaking or reading Chinese by hating the old society and loving Chairman Mao. He used the Chinese version to study Chairman Mao's works just as well. Some comrades, despite having eye diseases and being unable to read Chairman Mao's books, had others read to them. Some, after recovering their sight, looked at the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" first. Some, despite being seriously ill and unable to eat, never stopped studying Chairman Mao's works. Some representatives said: If someone asked me, what do you love the most in the world? I would answer without hesitation: I love Chairman Mao the most, and I love Mao Zedong Thought the most. The deeds of many units and comrades show that because they have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, they also regard studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the highest, greatest, most important, and heaviest thing.

Where do the deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought come from? Everyone realized: First, from recalling bitterness and sweetness. Comrade Lin Biao said, recalling bitterness is recalling class bitterness, recalling national bitterness. Studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works should start from here. The facts are indeed like this: those who remember class bitterness deeply have high class consciousness and love Chairman Mao's works the most and study them the best. Every time a bitterness education campaign is launched, the army launches a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Second, from reviewing the history of our party and army and personal progress. In the history of our party and army, whenever the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is held high and everything is done according to Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary cause is invincible. Whenever Mao Zedong Thought is violated, mistakes are bound to be made. Third, from the practical struggle of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many comrades, through the struggle of intensively applying Chairman Mao's works, deeply realized that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can only be done in struggle, in struggle, and in intense application to understand, remember, and apply. The more one studies, the more intensely one applies, the deeper the class feelings. The more one studies Chairman Mao's works, the more one loves Chairman Mao; the more one loves Chairman Mao, the more one loves studying Chairman Mao's works. Fourth, from learning from heroic figures. Learning from the heroes of the Mao Zedong era is a great inspiration for class feelings in studying Chairman Mao's works. Every time a hero is publicized, it is a great promotion for studying Chairman Mao's works.

The attendees unanimously agreed that the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has reached a new high tide, and the entire party, army, and nation have entered a new stage of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, presenting a new situation and new developments. This great revolutionary situation is a great encouragement and strong motivation for our army, which further emphasizes our responsibility. We must resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call to turn the army into a great school. With deep class feelings, we must study Chairman Mao's works extensively and establish Mao Zedong Thought firmly. Chairman Mao's books are not only for our generation to study but also for future generations to study, to study better each year, each generation. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is not only for our generation to hold high but also for future generations to hold high, to hold it higher each year, each generation. Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be abandoned; the sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but the determination to study Chairman Mao's works will never change.

    对毛主席著作爱得深才能用得狠
    沈阳部队召开积极分子代表会议，交流在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验
    新华社沈阳九日电　最近，人民解放军沈阳部队召开学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议，广泛交流活学活用毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验。代表们说：学习的经验有一千条，一万条，无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想是最根本的一条。对毛主席著作爱得深才能用得狠，用得狠才能爱得更深。
    沈阳部队在抓学习毛主席著作的落实中，突出地表现了一个“狠”字。一是领导抓得狠：抓党委带头狠，抓典型引路狠，抓经验推广狠；二是大家用得狠：狠在改造世界观上用，狠在阶级斗争中用，在狠斗私心杂念上用。抓得狠，学得狠，特别是用得狠，使活学活用毛主席著作的形势越来越好，特别是林彪同志提出继续突出政治五项原则以来，更是好上加好，老典型有新发展，新典型有新高度。出现了“老将”带“小将”，“小将”促“老将”；机关带连队，连队促机关；上级带下级，下级促上级；干部带家属，家属促干部的生动局面。涌现了一大批活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位，一大批“老将”，一大批“小将”，一大批“女将”。出席这次会议的同志，就是“四个一大批”的突出代表。
    会上介绍的经验表明：活学活用毛主席著作的狠劲，来自对伟大的领袖毛主席，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱。代表们说：“爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席亲”，“毛泽东思想和我们血连肉，心贴心”，“毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们心中最红最红的太阳”，“毛泽东思想是革命的根本，生命的灵魂，智慧的海洋，力量的源泉，战斗的武器，行动的指南”。有些代表，入伍时是文盲，他们能够很快地闯过不识字的难关，直接掌握毛泽东思想，靠的就是对毛主席无限热爱，对毛主席著作有深厚的阶级感情。他们一手拿毛主席著作，一手拿字典，一字一字地学，一条一条地记，为学习毛主席著作而学文化，抢时间，排万难，在毛泽东思想哺育下，迅速成长。他们体会到，能不能掌握毛泽东思想，不在于文化水平高低，而在于对毛主席著作感情的深浅。用得狠不狠，在于对毛主席著作的感情深不深。工程兵某部朝鲜族战士尹阳春，出身于贫苦家庭，他以憎恨旧社会，热爱毛主席的感情，克服了不通汉语，不识汉字的困难，用汉文版本同样学好了毛主席著作。有的同志害了眼病，不能看毛主席的书，就请别人给念；有的眼睛受伤，恢复光明后，第一眼要看的是《毛主席语录》；有的病重吃不下饭，学毛主席著作从不间断。有的代表说：要是有人问我，世界上你最爱的是什么？我会毫不犹豫地回答：我最爱毛主席，最爱毛泽东思想。许多单位，许多同志的事迹表明：由于他们对毛主席怀有深厚的阶级感情，他们也就把活学活用毛主席著作看得高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切。
    对毛主席，对毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情从哪里来？大家体会到：首先，从忆苦思甜中来。林彪同志说，忆苦就是忆阶级苦，忆民族苦。学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席著作，都要从这里出发。事实正是这样，谁对阶级苦记得牢，谁的阶级觉悟就高，谁对毛主席著作爱的也就最深，学习得最好。每搞一次忆苦教育，部队就掀起一次活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。其次，从回顾我党我军历史和个人的进步成长中来。在我党我军的历史上，凡是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底按毛泽东思想办事的，革命事业就无往而不胜。凡是违背了毛泽东思想，就一定要犯错误。第三，从活学活用毛主席著作的斗争实践中来。许多同志通过在用字上狠下功夫的斗争实践，深刻认识到：活学活用毛主席著作，只有在斗争中学，斗争中用，在用字上狠下功夫才能学得懂、记得住、用得上。学得越多，用得越狠，阶级感情越深。越学毛主席著作，越热爱毛主席；越热爱毛主席，越爱学毛主席著作。第四，从学习英雄人物中来。学习毛泽东时代的英雄人物，是对学习毛主席著作阶级感情的大激发。每宣传一次英雄，就是对学习毛主席著作的一次大推动。
    到会同志一致认为，当前我国无产阶级文化大革命出现了新高潮，全党全军全国活学活用毛主席著作进入了一个新阶段，出现了新局面新形势。这种大好的革命形势对我们部队是个巨大的鼓舞，有力的鞭策，更加重了我们的责任，我们一定要最坚决地贯彻党的八届十一中全会精神，最热烈地响应毛主席关于把部队办成大学校的伟大号召，带着深厚的阶级感情大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想。毛主席的书，不仅我们这一代要学，子孙万代都要学，要一级比一级学得好，一年比一年学得好，一代比一代学得好；毛泽东思想伟大红旗不仅我们这一代要高举，子孙万代都要高举，要一级比一级举得高，一年比一年举得高，一代比一代举得高。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢，海可枯，石可烂，学习毛主席著作决心永不变。
