    To the Editor,

    We live in an area near the Bohai Gulf, where the land is vast and the population sparse, with abundant wild resources. Thanks to the socialist education campaign, we have protected these various wild resources very well this year. At first glance, these miscellaneous items may not seem significant, but when gathered together, they are treasures that benefit production, life, and national construction.

    Chairman Mao said, "Comprehensive planning and consideration are for the six hundred million people. When we make plans, do work, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has six hundred million people. Never forget this point." When we do a good job in the "Little Autumn Harvest," we should also not forget this point. We should have a broad vision for the country and look at the world. Not to mention some export commodities and precious medicinal materials, just taking firewood as an example, if we gather it, not only can we be self-sufficient, but we can also support other places in large quantities. If the whole country does the same, it can save the country a large amount of coal. Moreover, there are countless wild plants that can be utilized across the country. If everyone takes action and collects them through the "Little Autumn Harvest," the effect will be even greater.

    The "Little Autumn Harvest" is actually not small; it is a major task in rural production at present. Organizing and arranging it well is very important. We hope that leaders at all levels will pay attention to this, hope that various sectors will provide assistance, and hope that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants will study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and fight a good battle in the "Little Autumn Harvest."

    Dang Chunyang
    Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association, Dajiaxiang Brigade, Jiaxiang Commune, Huanghua, Hebei

    To the Editor,

    This autumn harvest is a good one. Now, the peasants are all happily engaged in the three autumn tasks. We must harvest the main crops well and also do a good job in the "Little Autumn Harvest." The production team should organize labor to gather all kinds of wild plants that can be eaten, worn, used, and burned. We should gather everything that grows on the mountains, on the ground, on the trees, and in the water. Last year, our team alone earned more than 5,000 yuan just from the "Little Autumn Harvest." The returns are substantial!

    Liu Naili
    Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association, Hongyang Brigade, Yujixiang Commune, Shangcheng, Henan

    The letters from Dang Chunyang and Liu Naili show a high sense of political responsibility and the poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love for socialism. The two letters raise an important issue that deserves attention during the current autumn harvest.

    At this time of year, there are many useful wild plants everywhere. We should seize the opportunity to collect as many of them as possible. Doing so can support the country's socialist construction, meet the needs of urban and rural populations, and increase the income of collectives and peasants.

    Comrades in charge of rural work in various places must pay attention to this matter and not overlook the "Little Autumn Harvest" just because agriculture has had a good harvest. — Editor

### 抓好“小秋收”

    抓好“小秋收”编辑同志：
    我们这一带靠近渤海湾，地广人稀，野生的东西很多很多。因为经过社会主义教育运动，今年我们对各种野生资源都保护得很好。乍看起来，这些杂七杂八的东西，好像不显眼，可是，抓到手，集中起来，都是宝贝，对生产、生活和国家建设，都有很大的用项。
    毛主席说：“统筹兼顾，是指对于六亿人口的统筹兼顾。我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”我们搞好“小秋收”，也不要忘记这一点。也要胸怀祖国，放眼世界。不用说一些出口物资和珍贵药材，就拿烧柴一项来说，我们抓到手，不光能自给自足，还可大量支援外地。全国都照样办，就能给国家节约大量煤炭。再说，全国各地有数不尽的可以利用的野生植物，如果人人动手，通过“小秋收”，收集起来，作用就更大了。
    “小秋收”其实并不小，是当前农村生产中的一件大事。组织好，安排好，很要紧。我们希望各级领导重视起来，希望各行各业加以协助，希望广大贫下中农社员活学活用毛主席著作，打好“小秋收”这一仗。
    河北黄骅贾象公社大贾象大队贫协主任  董春阳编辑同志：
    今年秋收是个好年成，眼下社员们都在欢天喜地的搞三秋。俺们要把大秋收好，也要把“小秋收”搞好。生产队要组织劳力，把能吃的，能穿的，能用的，能烧的各种野生植物都收起来，把山上长的，地上生的，树上长的，水里生的各种有用的东西，都尽量收起来。去年俺们队光搞“小秋收”，就收入五千多元，油水可大哩！
    河南商城余集公社红阳大队贫协主任  刘乃礼
    董春阳、刘乃礼同志的来信，表现了高度的政治责任心，表现了贫下中农对社会主义的无限热爱。两封信提出了当前秋收中的一个值得重视的问题。
    当前这个季节，有用的野生植物，遍地都是。应当把这些东西，不失时机地尽量采集起来。这样做，既可以支援国家社会主义建设，满足城乡人民生活需要，又可以增加集体和社员的收入。
    各地领导农村工作的同志们，一定要把这件事重视起来，切不可因为农业又获得丰收，就把“小秋收”忽略了。　　　　——编者
