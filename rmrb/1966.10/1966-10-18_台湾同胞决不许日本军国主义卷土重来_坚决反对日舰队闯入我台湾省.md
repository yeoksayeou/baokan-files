Taiwanese compatriots will never allow Japanese militarism to resurge.
Firmly oppose the Japanese fleet's intrusion into our Taiwan Province.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, the Japanese government led by Sato, a faithful henchman of American imperialism, recently dispatched a fleet to intrude into our territory, Taiwan Province's Keelung Port, sparking great indignation among Taiwanese compatriots.

According to a magazine published by the KMT in Hong Kong, *News World*, it was revealed that on September 29th, four Japanese destroyers, equipped with 127mm cannons, flew the Rising Sun flag and arrogantly sailed into Keelung Port. Seeing this, Taiwanese compatriots were filled with rage. A Mr. Lin from Keelung City, who had suffered greatly under Japanese imperialism, could not contain his anger and exclaimed: "When Japan occupied Taiwan, we endured enough of the Japanese militarists' oppression. Today, they dare to come back!" This magazine from the KMT had to admit that Mr. Lin's words expressed the common indignation of 12 million Taiwanese people against the American and Japanese reactionaries' invasion of our territory and waters.

Even more intolerable is that when the Japanese fleet intruded into Keelung Port, the Japanese "Embassy Military Attaché Office" in Taiwan audaciously proposed to the KMT authorities that the more than 1,100 Japanese naval officers and soldiers on board should hold an armed parade in the city of Keelung. Due to the firm opposition of Taiwanese compatriots, this provocative plan was not dared to be carried out.

    台湾同胞决不许日本军国主义卷土重来
    坚决反对日舰队闯入我台湾省
    据新华社十七日讯  美帝国主义的忠实走卒日本佐藤政府，在不久前派遣舰队闯入我国领土台湾省基隆港，激起了台湾同胞极大的愤怒。
    据蒋帮在香港办的杂志《新闻天地》透露，九月二十九日，四艘日本驱逐舰，配备着一二七毫米口径的大炮，高悬膏药旗，耀武扬威地开进基隆港。台湾同胞看见这种情况，个个怒火填膺。一个曾经饱受日本帝国主义摧残与欺凌的基隆市林姓同胞，按不住心头怒火，愤慨地说：过去日本占据台湾的时候，我们受够了日本军阀的气，今天他们竟然又来了！这家蒋帮的杂志也不得不承认，这位林姓同胞的话，正表达了一千二百万台湾人民反对美日反动派侵犯我国领土领海的共同的愤怒呼声。
    更加令人不能容忍的是，日本舰队侵入基隆码头时，日本驻台湾“大使馆武官处”，竟公然向蒋帮当局提出，舰上的一千一百多名日本海军官兵要在基隆市区武装游行。由于台湾同胞的坚决反对，这一挑衅计划才未敢实现。
