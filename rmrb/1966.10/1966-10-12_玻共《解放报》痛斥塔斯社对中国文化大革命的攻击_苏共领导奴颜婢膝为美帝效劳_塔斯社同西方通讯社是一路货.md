New China News Agency reports: La Paz news: The Communist Party of Bolivia's Central Committee's organ, "Liberation Daily," recently published an article strongly condemning the Soviet Union's Tass news agency for singing in unison with U.S. imperialism to madly attack the Communist Party of China, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently unfolding in China.

The article states: Since modern revisionism usurped the leadership of the CPSU, Tass has been relentlessly slandering Marxist-Leninists all over the world and serving the interests of U.S. imperialism. Tass's actions have become increasingly blatant in recent days because it has been spreading a large amount of slander and attacks against the People's Republic of China, attacking the leadership of the Communist Party of China, especially Chairman Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution that is triumphantly unfolding in China.

The article states that Tass's slanders are in line with the goals of the Associated Press, United Press International, and other Western news agencies, which is to defame the People's Republic of China and serve the U.S. ruling class, attempting to split and disintegrate the peoples of various countries, especially those peoples fighting for national liberation. The article points out that the root cause of Tass spreading such news is the modern revisionism that slavishly serves the interests of U.S. imperialism.

    玻共《解放报》痛斥塔斯社对中国文化大革命的攻击
    苏共领导奴颜婢膝为美帝效劳  塔斯社同西方通讯社是一路货
    新华社讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党中央委员会机关报《解放报》最近发表文章，强烈谴责苏联塔斯社同美帝国主义一唱一和，疯狂攻击中国共产党、中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，和正在中国开展的无产阶级文化大革命。
    文章说：自从现代修正主义篡夺苏共领导权以来，塔斯社一个劲儿地诬蔑全世界的马克思列宁主义者，为美帝国主义的利益效劳。塔斯社这种勾当近日来更加露骨，因为它大量诬蔑攻击中华人民共和国，攻击中国共产党领导人，特别是攻击毛泽东主席和正在中国胜利开展的文化革命。
    文章说，塔斯社的诬蔑同美联社、合众国际社和其他西方通讯社的目的是一致的，就是诋毁中华人民共和国，为美国统治集团服务，企图分裂和瓦解各国人民，特别是那些为民族解放而斗争的人民。文章指出，塔斯社之所以播发这样的消息，根源在于奴颜婢膝地为美帝国主义利益效劳的现代修正主义。
