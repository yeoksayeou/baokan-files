The U.S. Empire, in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, is pushing a "peace talk" plot to cover up the escalation of the war. McNamara heads to South Vietnam to plan the expansion of the war, while Johnson is set to visit the Philippines to meet with Asian and Australian lackeys.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, Washington reports: U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara left Washington on the 8th for Saigon to inspect the South Vietnamese battlefield for a week and discuss with the heads of the invading U.S. forces in Vietnam and the South Vietnamese puppet regime on how to intensify the U.S. war in Vietnam.

This is McNamara's eighth trip to South Vietnam during the U.S. invasion. Accompanying him are Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler, Deputy Secretary of State Katzenbach, and others. On the evening of the 7th, the U.S. President specially met with McNamara and others to give them "final instructions" for their trip to South Vietnam. It is reported that McNamara personally inspects the South Vietnamese battlefield again to collect information for the U.S. government to make new decisions on U.S. war expenses in Vietnam, further military expansion, and weapons production, preparing for the escalation of the war.

The backdrop of McNamara's trip to South Vietnam this time is that the U.S. imperialists are suffering heavy losses in South Vietnam, becoming more defeated, and the war of aggression in Vietnam is increasingly at a dead end. Therefore, they have recently become more blatant in pushing the "peace talk" deception to cover up the preparation for the escalation of the war, attempting to continue their desperate struggle.

The Johnson administration has recently been continuously sending more troops to South Vietnam and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam while, at the same time, colluding with the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, the British Labour government, UN Secretary-General U Thant, and the likes of the Vatican Pope, using the United Nations as the center of activity. They are utilizing every possible diplomatic contact point to surround the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam, launching a new "peace offensive." For a moment, a chaotic scene of demons dancing appears, throwing out various "peace" proposals such as the "Goldberg Plan," "U Thant Plan," and "Brown Plan." Accompanying these activities, the White House announced on the 5th that the U.S. has temporarily suspended bombing the eastern section of the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam, bringing the U.S. "peace offensive" to a new high.

However, the Johnson administration's "peace" posture cannot cover up the U.S. imperialists' actions to escalate the war.

It is reported that the U.S. has formulated a plan to establish an "international" force composed of U.S., South Korean, Australian, and South Vietnamese troops to invade the demilitarized zone after the U.S. congressional elections. In coordination with this, on October 5th, another 4,000 U.S. invading troops landed in South Vietnam, bringing the total number of U.S. invading troops in Vietnam to 321,000. According to a report by The New York Times on the same day, the U.S. also plans to send an additional 75,000 troops to Vietnam by early next year, bringing the total to 400,000 to 425,000.

At the same time, a meeting planned by the U.S., with the participation of the heads of governments of the U.S., South Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, is scheduled to be held in the Philippines in late October. Johnson also announced that he will visit Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, "Malaysia," and South Korea before and after attending the above meeting. According to U.S. news agencies, he may also stop by South Vietnam. Regarding the purpose of this series of activities by the Johnson administration, the U.S. Christian Science Monitor admits: "While launching a 'peace offensive,' the U.S. is preparing for a larger-scale war in Vietnam."

    在南越捣乱失败还要再捣乱再失败直至灭亡
    美帝勾结苏修大搞“和谈”阴谋掩盖战争“升级”
    麦克纳马拉再去南越策划扩大战争　约翰逊将到菲律宾与亚澳仆从会谈
    据新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉八日离开华盛顿前往西贡，对南越战场作一个星期的视察，并同侵越美军和南越卖国集团的头子讨论加紧进行美国侵越战争的问题。
    这是麦克纳马拉在美国侵越战争中第八次到南越活动。随行的有参谋长联席会议主席惠勒、副国务卿卡曾巴赫等人。七日晚间，美国总统又专门接见了麦克纳马拉等人，对他们的南越之行作了“最后的指示”。据报道，麦克纳马拉再次亲自出马视察南越战场，是要为美国政府收集情况，以便就美国的侵越战争费用，进一步扩军问题和武器生产等问题作出新的决定，为扩大战争作准备。
    麦克纳马拉这次南越之行的背景是：美帝国主义在南越战场上损兵折将，越败越惨，侵越战争更加走投无路，因而最近更加露骨地在加紧推行“和谈”骗局的掩盖下，猖狂地准备战争“升级”，企图继续进行垂死的挣扎。
    约翰逊政府最近在继续不断向南越增兵，加强对越南北方的狂轰滥炸的同时，勾结苏联现代修正主义领导集团、英国工党政府、联合国秘书长吴丹和梵蒂冈教皇之流，以联合国为活动中心，利用每一个可能的外交接触点，围绕美国侵越政策，展开了一个新的“和平攻势”，一时间出现了群魔乱舞的局面，抛出了什么“戈德堡方案”、“吴丹方案”、“布朗方案”等五花八门的“和平”建议。配合着这些活动，白宫在五日宣布美国已经暂停对越南南北部之间非军事区东段的轰炸，使美国的“和平攻势”，达到一个新的高潮。
    但是，约翰逊政府的“和平”姿态，掩盖不了美帝国主义扩大战争的行动。
    据报道，美国为了加剧战争，已经制定了一项计划，规定建立一支由美国、南朝鲜、澳大利亚和南越军队组成的所谓“国际”部队，在美国国会选举之后侵入非军事区。与此相配合，十月五日，又有四千名美国侵略军在南越登陆，使美国侵越军总数达到了三十二万一千人。据《纽约时报》同一天报道，美国还预定到明年初再增派侵越美军七万五千名，使总数达到四十万到四十二万五千人。
    在这同时，一个由美国策划，有美国、南越、泰国、菲律宾、南朝鲜、澳大利亚和新西兰政府首脑参加的会议，将于十月下旬在菲律宾举行。约翰逊还宣布，他在出席上述会议前后，将访问澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、“马来西亚”以及南朝鲜。据美国通讯社透露，还可能到南越停留。对于约翰逊政府这一连串活动的目的，美国《基督教科学箴言报》承认：美国在发动“和平攻势”的同时，“正在作好准备在越南进行规模更大的战争”。
