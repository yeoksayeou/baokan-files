Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Denounces Manila Conference as a War Meeting of U.S. Imperialism and Its Lackeys
Vietnamese People Resolutely Fight to Achieve Final Victory
The Peace Deception of U.S. Imperialism and Its Lackeys Cannot Fool the World's People

	Hanoi, October 23 (Xinhua) — The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today condemning the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to hold the Manila Conference scheduled for October 24. The statement pointed out, "The essence of the Manila Conference is a war meeting of the United States and its lackeys."

	The statement reaffirmed the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the serious stance of the Vietnamese people on the resolution of the Vietnamese issue. The statement emphasized, "No matter how vicious and cunning U.S. imperialism is, it cannot save itself from defeat. The Vietnamese people resolutely fight to achieve the final victory."

	The statement said, "For ten years, U.S. imperialism has launched and almost single-handedly conducted the war of aggression against Vietnam. Over 300,000 U.S. expeditionary forces are currently carrying out occupation and 'pacification' tasks in South Vietnam. It is also accelerating the deployment of troops, preparing to strengthen and expand the war in South Vietnam, while frantically escalating the conflict by bombing an independent and sovereign country — the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The crimes committed by the United States in Vietnam are far more severe than those committed by Hitler's fascism."

	The statement further pointed out that due to the strong condemnation from progressive humanity, including the American people, U.S. imperialism is in unprecedented isolation. Facing this situation, U.S. imperialism is conspiring to use the Manila Conference to cover up its own despicable face of waging war. However, the United States holding a meeting with a group of exposed lackeys in Asia and the Pacific not only fails to cover up the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism but also further exposes the United States' vicious conspiracy of using Asians to fight Asians.

	The statement said, "U.S. imperialism and its lackey group are loudly advocating peace for the Vietnamese issue. However, their peace deception cannot fool the world's people."

	The statement said, "The United States and its lackey group talk about developing the economy and society, talk about eliminating poverty, disease, and ignorance in war; this is nothing but a replay of the 'carrot and stick' trick."

	The statement said, "The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam call on the people of the world, as well as the people of the United States, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand, to resolutely fight to smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to use the Manila Conference to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, and to further strongly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people."

    越外交部发言人指出马尼拉会议是美帝及其走狗的一次战争会议
    越南人民坚决战斗　夺取最后胜利
    美帝及其走狗的和平欺骗论调遮不住世界人民的耳目
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天发表声明谴责美帝国主义策划的将在二十四日举行的马尼拉会议的阴谋。声明指出，“马尼拉会议的实质是美国及其走狗的一次战争会议。”
    声明重申越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明是越南人民关于解决越南问题的严正立场。声明强调指出：“不管美帝国主义多么恶毒和狡猾，也挽救不了它的败局。越南人民坚决战斗，以夺取最后的胜利”。
    声明说，“十年来，美帝国主义发动并几乎是‘单枪匹马’地进行对越南的侵略战争。三十多万美国远征军正在越南南方执行占领和‘绥靖’任务。它还在加紧增兵，准备加强和扩大对越南南方的战争，同时疯狂地升级，用飞机袭击一个独立和拥有主权的国家——越南民主共和国。美国在越南犯下的罪行比希特勒法西斯犯下的罪行还要严重多倍。”
    声明接着指出，由于遭到包括美国人民在内的进步人类的强烈谴责，美帝国主义陷于空前的孤立。面对这种情况，美帝国主义阴谋用马尼拉会议来掩盖美国自己进行战争的卑鄙面目。但是，美国同亚洲和太平洋的一群暴露无遗的走狗开会，不仅掩盖不了美帝国主义的侵略面目，反而进一步揭穿了美国用亚洲人打亚洲人的恶毒阴谋。
    声明说：“美帝国主义及其走狗集团大肆宣扬为越南问题谋求和平。但是，它们的和平欺骗论调是遮不住世界人民的耳目的。”
    声明说：“美国及其走狗集团谈到发展经济和社会，谈到消灭贫穷、疾病和愚昧的战争；这只不过是它重演‘大棒加胡萝卜’的骗局而已。”
    声明说：“越南人民和越南民主共和国政府呼吁世界人民以及美国、南朝鲜、菲律宾、泰国、澳大利亚和新西兰人民，为粉碎美帝国主义利用马尼拉会议来加强和扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋而坚决斗争，并进一步强有力地支持越南人民的正义斗争。”
