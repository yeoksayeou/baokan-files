The entire city rejoices: Long live, long live Chairman Mao!
—The capital's people warmly celebrate the success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch

Hurrah! Sing! Today, our great motherland's capital, the place where our most beloved leader Chairman Mao resides—Beijing—is immersed in boundless joy. Millions of people are spreading the news that fills the heart with excitement: Our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch was successful! Millions of people shout in unison:

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live, long live, long live our most beloved leader Chairman Mao!

At midnight, the powerful radio waves of the Central People's Broadcasting Station transmitted the great news to the capital and to revolutionary people around the world. The "extra edition" of the People's Daily with big red characters flew all over the city. People cheered, jumped, and ran to tell each other, creating a scene of great rejoicing. Many people stayed up all night to put up banners, write reports of joy, and rush to Tiananmen Square and the reception center of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council to express their utmost joy and their determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the early morning, Tiananmen City Gate and the surrounding square were brightly lit. Red Guards and revolutionary students from the capital and other places who came to Beijing for revolutionary connections held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, carried revolutionary red flags, beat drums, struck gongs, sang songs, and danced the Yangge from their schools and homes, braving the cold frost, gathering here in groups. In front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, they waved the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live Chairman Mao!" They sang songs like "The Ship Sails on Because of the Helmsman" and danced the Yangge.

When the cars distributing the "extra edition" arrived at Tiananmen Square, they were immediately surrounded by the crowd, with countless arms raised high, everyone wanting to get a copy of the "extra edition" first. The "extra edition" flew like snowflakes among the crowd. People who got the "extra edition" ran and jumped, shouting over and over, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" At this time, cars full of revolutionary students from other places arrived here, and they all stopped spontaneously. The people on the square immediately ran over, reporting the good news to their comrades in the cars, and jumping, they handed the "extra edition" through the car windows to their comrades.

Some revolutionary students from Inner Mongolia, Xi'an, Wuhan, Harbin, and other places got off the train and heard the news, and with their backpacks, they rushed straight to Tiananmen Square. They excitedly said, "We came to Chairman Mao's side, and the first thing we encountered was such a big piece of good news, it's really too happy!"

Some revolutionary students from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics heard the good news and immediately thought of Chairman Mao and the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They pasted a giant double happiness character at the front of Tiananmen and pasted large red banners on the red wall of the viewing platform. A big-character poster read: "The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, the US-Soviet collaboration is on the verge of collapse."

On the west side of the road in Tiananmen Square, the performers of the Cultural and Art Group of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions sang and danced:

The Chinese people hold high the red flag of revolution,
Successfully launched the missile and nuclear weapon,
Angering the US imperialists, angering the "old revisionists."
The revolutionary people are overjoyed,
Long live, long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

On this day of national rejoicing, the revolutionary masses of the capital all eagerly wanted to report their joy to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. The radio waves that first broadcast this good news had not yet faded, and the stream of people reporting to Chairman Mao, like a tide, surged from all directions of Beijing City to the reception center of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.

In front of the reception center and on the connected roads, the crowd was like the sea, and the red flags were like forests. The sound of drums and gongs, and cheers shook the earth, forming a sea of rejoicing. This was the center of the capital's revolutionary masses' rejoicing, with waves of joy one after another, never ending.

Among the thousands of reporting teams, there was a team of workers. On top of their report of joy, they pinned a beautifully made plastic Chairman Mao badge and five small badges, with the words: "Please pass this to the soldiers, workers, and scientific and technological personnel who participated in the missile and nuclear weapon test. All revolutionary workers of the Beijing Plastic Button Factory." It turned out that the workers of this factory, after hearing the good news in the early morning, immediately decided to send representatives to report to the Party Central Committee. The plastic Chairman Mao badge is a new product that this factory just successfully trial-produced yesterday. They said that the soldiers, workers, and scientific and technological personnel who participated in the test held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and made important contributions. Giving this gift to them is the most appropriate.

The reporting teams surged forward. In the afternoon, eleven young revolutionaries came to the reception center. Their dark faces were flushed with excitement, and they performed lively cheers for the success of the missile and nuclear weapon test launch, such as "Three Sentences and a Half" and "Small Drums," winning enthusiastic applause from the audience. These eleven young revolutionaries were Red Guards from the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team" of Bengbu Railway Middle School. Not long ago, they traveled for forty-four days from the south bank of the Huai River to Beijing for revolutionary connections. Today, the good news excited them to the point of boiling blood. They said, "We just arrived at Chairman Mao's side, and we got such big news, it's really double happiness!" They expressed their determination at the reception center: "A red heart that never changes, forever loyal to Chairman Mao!"

Revolutionary scientific workers and revolutionary workers from various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also came to the reception center. This morning, when the good news came, many people were awakened from their sleep, and without even putting on their clothes, they went out to find the "extra edition" and quickly formed a team to go to the reception center to report the good news. The revolutionary comrades of the Chemical Research Institute discussed what banner to bring to the reception center, with some saying to write "Warmly celebrate the success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch" and others thinking that this did not express everyone's feelings and that "most" should be added before this sentence. Everyone was still not satisfied. Finally, everyone agreed to write "Long live, long live Chairman Mao" in six large characters on the banner.

The good news reached the coal mining area of Jingxi. Retired old miner Bai Baochun heard the shouting of "extra edition" on the street from his sleep and hurriedly got up and ran to the street. Upon hearing that our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch was successful, he was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. After getting the "extra edition," he forgot his old age and fatigue and ran to dozens of houses, knocking on doors to spread the news. He said, "We Chinese have missile and nuclear weapons, this is the pride of the Chinese people, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. I want to shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" After hearing the broadcast, some workers of the Beijing Second Textile Mill immediately organized a reporting team to report the good news in various workshops. Every time they went to a workshop, they loudly read the "extra edition." The workers could not contain their excitement, holding up the "extra edition," standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, shouting over and over, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live Chairman Mao!" During the break, a team of women workers, wearing red flowers and holding bouquets, danced the "The Ship Sails on Because of the Helmsman" in the workshop.

"We have missile and nuclear weapons!" Many members of the Huangtugang Production Brigade of Huangtugang People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing got up especially early this morning, and people eagerly spread this inspiring good news to their class brothers. Some young men jumped out of bed, put on their clothes, and went to write a blackboard newspaper. The brigade broadcaster turned on the radio one hour earlier than usual to broadcast this good news to all members. National People's Congress representative and agricultural labor model Yin Weichen, who has seen our great leader Chairman Mao more than ten times since liberation, said excitedly, "Chairman Mao, it is you who led us poor people to make revolution, established New China, and won one victory after another in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Now our country also has missile and nuclear weapons, this should be attributed to your wise leadership."

In the universities and colleges in the urban and suburban areas of Beijing, from early morning to night, the sound of singing did not stop, and the spirits were high. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff stayed up all night to write big-character posters, hold celebration meetings, parade, and rush to rehearse reporting art programs. The shouts of "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" echoed through the campuses of various schools.

    满城人民齐欢呼：万岁，万岁，毛主席！
    ——首都人民热烈庆贺我国发射导弹核武器试验成功
    欢呼啊！歌唱啊！今天，我们伟大祖国的首都、我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席居住的地方——北京，整日沉浸在无比的欢乐之中。千百万人传颂着一个振奋人心的消息：我国发射导弹核武器试验成功！千百万人齐声欢呼：
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    今天凌晨零点五十分，中央人民广播电台的强大电波给首都和全世界革命人民传送着大喜讯，《人民日报》大红字的“号外”满城飞舞，人们欢呼、跳跃，奔走相告，一片欢腾。许多人星夜贴标语、写喜报，奔向天安门，奔向中共中央和国务院的群众接待站，向毛主席和党中央表达他们最最欢乐的心情和誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。
    凌晨，天安门城楼和广场四周灯光通明。首都和外地来京进行革命串连的红卫兵和革命师生高举着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，扛着革命的红旗，擂起鼓，敲起锣，唱着歌，从学校、从住地，冒着寒霜，成群结队地汇集到这里。他们在毛主席的巨幅画像面前，不停地挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，高呼“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”纵情地歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，扭起了秧歌舞。
    当散发“号外”的汽车来到天安门广场的时候，立刻被人群围得水泄不通，无数双手臂高举过头，谁都想首先得到一张“号外”。“号外”像雪片似的在人群中飞舞。人们拿到“号外”，乐得跑呀，跳呀，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”这时，一辆辆满载外地来京革命师生的汽车来到这里，都不约而同地停下来了，广场上的人们马上奔跑过去，一边向车上的战友报告好消息，一边跳着把一张张“号外”从车窗口送到战友们的手里。
    来自内蒙古、西安、武汉、哈尔滨等地的一些革命师生，有的下了火车听到这个消息，就背着背包直奔天安门广场来了。他们激动地说：“我们来到毛主席身边，头一桩就遇到这么大的喜事，真是太幸福了！”
    北京航空学院一些革命学生听到了喜讯，首先想到的就是毛主席，就是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们把一个巨大的双喜字贴在天安门前，把一幅幅大红标语贴在观礼台的红墙上。一张大字报写道：“毛泽东思想红旗高照，美苏合作日暮途穷。”
    在天安门广场西头的大道上，中华全国总工会文工团的演员们载歌载舞地唱道：
    中国人民高举革命红旗，
    成功发射了导弹核武器，
    气死美帝，气死“老修”。
    革命人民欢天喜地，
    万岁，万岁，伟大的中国共产党！
    万岁，万岁，伟大的领袖毛主席！
    在这举国欢腾的大喜日子里，首都广大革命群众都急切地想把心中的欢乐报告给最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。第一次播送这个喜讯的电波还没有消逝，向毛主席报喜的人流，就像潮水一般，从北京城的四面八方，滚滚涌向中共中央和国务院的群众接待站。
    接待站门前和与它相连接的大道上，人群如海，红旗如林，锣鼓声、欢呼声震天动地，汇成了一片欢腾的海洋。这里是首都广大革命群众欢腾的中心，欢乐的高潮一个接着一个，整日不断。
    在千百个报喜的队伍中，有一支工人的队伍，他们在一份喜报的上面，别着一个用塑料制成的精致的毛主席像大纪念章和五个小纪念章，旁边写着：“请党中央转交给参加导弹核武器试验的解放军指战员、工人和科学技术人员。北京塑料钮扣厂全体革命职工。”原来，这个厂的职工在今天凌晨听到喜讯以后，立即决定派代表向党中央报喜，塑料制的毛主席像纪念章是这个工厂昨天刚刚试制成功的新产品。他们说，参加试验的解放军指战员、工人和科学技术人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，作出了重要贡献，送这个礼物给他们最恰当不过了。
    报喜的队伍汹涌向前。下午，接待站前来了十一名革命小将，他们黝黑的脸上泛着激动的红光，演出了热烈欢呼发射导弹核武器试验成功的“三句半”、“小锣鼓”等节目，赢得了观众们热烈的掌声。这十一名小将是蚌埠铁路中学“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”的红卫兵。不久前，他们经过四十四天的长途跋涉，从淮河南岸来到北京进行革命串连。今天，喜讯激动得他们热血沸腾。他们说：“我们刚来到毛主席身边，又获得大喜讯，真是双喜临门！”他们在群众接待站前表达自己的决心：“一颗红心永不变，永远忠于毛主席！”
    中国科学院各研究所的革命科学工作者和革命职工也来到了接待站。今天清晨，当喜讯传来的时候，许多人从睡梦中被惊醒，来不及穿好衣服就上街找“号外”，并且很快就整好队伍，到接待站报喜。化学研究所的革命同志们在讨论带什么横幅到接待站的时候，有的说，写上“热烈欢呼我国发射导弹核武器试验成功”就可以了；有的认为，这样表达不了大家的心情，应当在这句话的前面加“最最”两个字。大家仍然不满意。最后，大家一致赞成在横幅上写：“毛主席万万岁”六个大字。
    喜讯传到了京西煤矿矿区，退休老矿工白宝纯，从睡梦中听到街上喊“号外”，连忙起床跑上街头，听说是我国发射导弹核武器试验成功，激动得热泪盈眶。他拿到“号外”后，忘记了年迈劳累，一口气跑了几十家，挨户宣传。他说：“我们中国有了导弹核武器，这是中国人民的骄傲，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我要高呼：毛主席万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”北京第二棉纺织厂的一些职工听到广播之后，立即组织了报喜队到各车间报喜。每到一个车间，他们就大声地宣读“号外”。工人们抑制不住内心的激动，高举着“号外”，站在毛主席像前，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”休息时，一队女工头戴红花，手拿花环，在车间里跳起《大海航行靠舵手》的舞蹈。
    “我们有导弹核武器了！”京郊黄土岗人民公社黄土岗大队的许多社员今天早晨起床特别早，人们争着把这个鼓舞人心的好消息传给自己的阶级兄弟。有的小伙子从被窝里一骨碌爬起来，披上衣服就去写黑板报。大队广播员比平时提前一个小时打开了广播机器，向全体社员播送这个好消息。全国人民代表大会代表、农业劳动模范殷维臣，解放以后见过我们伟大的领袖毛主席十几次，他激动地说，毛主席啊毛主席，是您老人家领导我们穷人闹革命，建立了新中国，赢得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一个又一个的胜利。现在我们国家也有了导弹核武器了，这应该归功于您老人家的英明领导。
    在北京市区和郊区的各大专院校里，今天从凌晨到夜晚歌声不断，群情振奋，革命的师生员工们连夜写大字报、开庆祝会、游行和赶着排演报喜的文艺节目。“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”的欢呼声响彻了各个学校的校园。
