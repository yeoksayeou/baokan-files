Chairman Mao's words have helped me straighten out the relationship between revolutionary and personal interests. I have decided to spend my life on the island. The island is my home.

Since 1952, I have been fighting and living on an island far from the mainland. Over the past fourteen years, the domestic and international situations have undergone tremendous changes, and the appearance of the military and the island has also changed greatly. We have seen off batch after batch of old comrades and welcomed batch after batch of new comrades. The military is truly a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. On our small island, we have trained a large number of red successors for the country.

After working on the island for a long time, I have experienced many struggles and island-building labors, and my feelings for the island have deepened. The idea of treating the island as my home has become more and more firmly established. However, for a period of time, my wife sent a letter from the mainland, hoping that I could return to the mainland to work. Her letter caused me to struggle with my thoughts: "Yes! I'm not young anymore, and I've been on the island for quite some time! It's time to reunite with my family." When I thought of my family, I quickly recalled the bitter days of the old society. In the old society, my ancestors and I worked for the landlord, my father was tortured to death by the landlord, and my mother went out begging to support the family. I became a long-term worker for the landlord at the age of seventeen. If it weren't for the Party liberating me and Mao Zedong Thought educating and cultivating me, how could I have today?

Later, I studied the section "The Whole Party Should Unite and Struggle to Achieve the Party's Tasks" in the article "On the Coalition Government." Chairman Mao calls on us: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward in their blood!" I thought of the past war years, how many revolutionary comrades had sacrificed their lives. We, the living, think of them and feel sad. I asked myself: Is there any personal interest that I cannot give up? I am a Communist Party member. The Party calls on me to guard the front line of the sea defense. This is my honor. The island is a steel dagger in the enemy's heart. I should be the steel on the blade. I should stand on the island, with my heart connected to Beijing and my eyes looking at the world. I wrote these thoughts in a letter to my wife, helping her to raise her awareness and correctly handle the relationship between revolutionary and personal interests.

Over the past fourteen years, I have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Hard work is like a burden in front of us. Let's see if we dare to bear it." I, together with my comrades, have built the island, built barracks, repaired fortifications, built reservoirs, paved roads, and reclaimed land for production. Every time there is a big wind or heavy rain at night, I go to the sentry post to stand guard with the soldiers.

The island is a shield of the motherland and the front line for defending the socialist construction of the motherland and supporting the world revolution. My heart is closely connected with the island. The island is my home. As long as the Party needs me, I am willing to spend my life on the island.

    毛主席的话，使我摆正了革命利益和个人利益的关系。我决心在海岛上干一辈子，
    海岛就是我的家
    福建前线某部副营长　唐和
    从一九五二年开始，我一直战斗和生活在远离大陆的海岛上。十四年来，国内外形势起了翻天覆地的变化，军队和海岛的面貌也起了很大的变化。送走了一批一批的老同志，又迎来了一批一批的新同志。军队真是一座毛泽东思想的大学校。在我们这个小岛上，就为国家造就了大批红色接班人。
    在海岛工作时间长了，经过了许多斗争和建岛劳动，我对海岛有了深厚的感情，以岛为家的思想越来越牢固了。可是，有一段时间，我的爱人从大陆上寄信来，希望我能回到大陆工作。她的信引起我的思想斗争：“是啊！年纪也不小了，在岛上的时间也不短啦！是和家人团聚的时候了。”想到了家，我很快就想起了旧社会的苦日子。在旧社会，我家祖祖辈辈给地主扛活，父亲被地主折磨死了，母亲为了养活全家外出讨饭，我十七岁就去给地主当长工。如果不是党解放了我，不是毛泽东思想教育、培养了我，我那能有今天？
    后来，我又带着这个问题学习了《论联合政府》一文中《全党团结起来，为实现党的任务而斗争》一节。毛主席号召我们：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”我想到以往的战争年代，多少革命战友牺牲了，我们活着的人，想到他们就心里难受。我责问自己：难道自己还有什么个人利益不能抛弃？我是一个共产党员，党叫我守卫在海防前线，这是我的光荣。海岛是我们插在敌人心窝的一把钢刀，我应该做刀刃上的钢。我要站在海岛，心连北京，眼望全球。我把这些想法写信告诉我爱人，帮助她提高认识，正确对待革命利益和个人利益的关系。
    十四年来，我一直牢记毛主席的教导：“艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”我和同志们一起进行海岛建设，盖营房，修工事，建水库，铺道路，开荒生产。每当刮大风、下大雨的夜晚，我就到哨位上陪同战士站岗。
    海岛是祖国的屏障，是捍卫祖国社会主义建设和支持世界革命的最前哨。我的心和海岛紧紧连在一起。海岛就是我的家。只要党需要，我愿意在海岛上干一辈子。
