The South China 155, a cargo ship with a capacity of over 4,000 tons, belongs to the Guangzhou Maritime Administration. For several years, it has sailed along the coastal waters of South China and the routes between China and Vietnam and Cambodia. Since early 1964, it has encountered American warships 53 times and aircraft over 200 times while sailing in international waters, facing challenges and threats. However, the crew is fearless, brave, and determined. They have broken through the enemy's disruptions and the raging waves, completing their sea transport missions excellently. People praise it as the "Sea Hardliner" and the "Sea Great Leap Forward."

The crew says: "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, the growth of all things relies on the sun, and doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Over the past few years, the Party branch of the South China 155 has organized the crew to study Chairman Mao's works, especially repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's brilliant statements about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers. The crew has armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, strategically despising the enemy while tactically taking them seriously, engaging in a fierce struggle against American imperialism. They fearlessly confront and firmly resist the provocations and threats from American warships and aircraft, ensuring that they can load and unload, and that their journey cannot be disrupted, becoming a revolutionary and combat-ready sea transport team. The fighting practice of the crew of the South China 155 once again proves that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force and the greatest fighting power.

One evening in March last year, the South China 155 encountered ten American warships, including an aircraft carrier, east of the Xisha Islands. They formed a battle array and came straight at us. One of the American warships used signal lights to interrogate and provoke for a long time. The South China 155 resolutely ignored it, while closely monitoring the movements of the enemy ships and maintaining its original speed and direction, breaking through the waves. The American warship that was signaling tried to approach, coming within four nautical miles of our merchant ship. The South China 155 firmly did not respond to the enemy's signal lights. The American warship, finding no way out, had to slip away.

At dawn on August 10 last year, in waters 85 nautical miles from the Tonggu Mouth of Hainan Island, the South China 155 had another confrontation with an American destroyer. This American warship, like a pirate, came from the left front, crossing over and continuously sending signal lights to interrogate. The South China 155 also ignored it. This American warship, when it was two nautical miles ahead of the South China 155, stopped and blocked its path. This deliberate violation of international maritime collision avoidance rules was clearly a provocation by the American warship. At this critical moment, the captain and the political commissar decided: We must resist this arrogant behavior and firmly defend the dignity of our motherland. Thus, the captain firmly ordered: "Course unchanged! Maintain original speed!"

At this time, the first-class sailor on duty, filled with hatred towards the enemy, steadfastly held the steering wheel, charging straight at the enemy ship. According to international maritime collision avoidance rules, the American warship should give way and move aside. When it was within one nautical mile, the American warship, seeing the situation was not good, hastily retreated in disgrace. The crew pointed at it and said, "If you really dared to collide with us, you would be a cowardly dog!" The American imperialists once again revealed their true colors as paper tigers in front of the heroic Chinese sailors. The South China 155, under the morning sky filled with clouds, sailed triumphantly through the waves and returned to the embrace of the motherland.

The sailors of the South China 155 always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "In front of wild beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice." They fearlessly sailed straight ahead even when American military aircraft were specifically sent to tail them. Last June, the South China 155 returned from Cambodia and was continuously tailed by American aircraft for three days and nights. Twenty days later, when it set sail from the motherland to Cambodia again, it was tailed by American aircraft for five days and nights. This time, the U.S. Seventh Fleet dispatched multiple batches of naval patrol aircraft in succession, taking turns to provoke, sometimes one, sometimes two or three, day and night, tailing the South China 155 for over 1,200 nautical miles, totaling 119 hours. The American imperialists were so crazy about disrupting the freedom of navigation on the high seas, shamelessly setting a "world record" for military aircraft tailing merchant ships for a long time.

The provocative aircraft circled around the South China 155, repeatedly diving to reconnoiter, taking low-altitude photographs, sometimes flying lower than the ship's mainmast, skimming past the ship's side. At night, they often used strong searchlights to shine on the ship's bridge, disrupting the navigation and control; or they threw luminous objects into the sea in front of the ship's course, disrupting our merchant ship's navigation and threatening the safety of our crew. However, the crew of the South China 155 are all revolutionary hardliners. They resolutely smashed the enemy aircraft's disruptions and sailed proudly towards their destination port amidst the raging waves. During the day, when American aircraft dove to take photographs, the current captain, Lu Ping, also took out a camera and stood on top of the bridge, photographing the provocations of the American aircraft and recording their model numbers. At night, when American aircraft used searchlights to shine and threw luminous objects, the on-duty navigation personnel watched the sea more carefully, precisely calculated the ship's position, and navigated more spiritedly at night, avoiding all obstacles thrown by the enemy aircraft and defeating their plot to disrupt safe navigation. Sailors Zhang Chun, Lu Suobao, and others were responsible for monitoring the movements of the American aircraft. Regardless of wind and rain, or the scorching sun, they always stood guard. Lu Suobao wrote a couplet on his post: "In the vast sky, search through the layers of clouds for flying insects; in the vast sea, capture snakes and insects amidst the rolling waves."

In the eyes of the crew of the South China 155, these American aircraft that came to provoke them were just buzzing, wailing, and crying like flies, just like harmful snakes and insects, nothing to be afraid of. The old captain, Shi Xingfu, said at the time: "We are just a merchant ship, and the American imperialists are so panicked and alarmed, as if facing a great enemy, tailing us for a long time. They look fierce, but in reality, it shows their weakness." Amidst the howling of the circling and diving American aircraft, the crew who were not on duty often laughed about the paper tigers. The engine mechanic, Wu Deming, humorously said, "This is Johnson sending a special aircraft to 'escort' us!" The sailor, Qiao Zhongyun, said, "The handover system of the American aircraft is quite 'sound,' we should write a letter to commend Johnson, the commander of the escort squadron." Under the provocation of the American aircraft, the crew sang revolutionary songs as they did before. The majestic songs of "Navigating the Sea Relies on the Helmsman," "Storm and Thunder," and "Liberating the South" broke through the howling of the American aircraft, echoing in the public sea tens of nautical miles off the coast of Kinh Mon Bay and Kunlun Island in South Vietnam.

Chairman Mao's brilliant statement that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers gave them great encouragement and boundless strength. Over the past few years, the crew hung this famous statement in the ship's meeting hall and repeatedly studied and applied it. The crew all said that it was Mao Zedong Thought that illuminated their fighting journey, making them dare to use an ordinary merchant ship to overcome the provocations of American imperialist aircraft and warships in the vast sea, and win the victory of sea transport. The fireman, Yu Guangshan, wrote a poem: "Chairman Mao's works illuminate the ship, every crew member's heart is bright, wholeheartedly for the revolution, the will to aid Vietnam and resist America is strong."

Chairman Mao taught us: Big things are not to be feared. Isn't American imperialism very big? We resisted it a bit, and it's nothing. So, some big things in the world are actually not to be feared. The crew of the South China 155 seriously implemented Chairman Mao's teachings, truly embodying the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people. Indeed, for an ordinary merchant ship, the American warships and aircraft that came to provoke are all big. However, the crew, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the lofty spirit of dedicating themselves to the socialist motherland and the world revolutionary cause, fear nothing and are not afraid of anything.

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The crew of the South China 155, whether at sea or in port, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and continuously armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the crew studying and discussing Chairman Mao's works.

    一只革命化战斗化的海上运输船
    ——记海上硬骨头南海一五五轮
    广州海运管理局所属的南海一五五轮，是一艘载重四千多吨的货轮，几年来行驶在华南沿海和中越、中柬航线上。从一九六四年初到现在，它在公海上航行时，曾先后遇到美国军舰五十三艘次、飞机二百多架次的挑衅和威胁。但是，船员们天不怕，地不怕，不怕苦，不怕死，冲破敌人的捣乱，冲破惊涛骇浪，出色地完成了海上运输任务。人们称誉它是“海上硬骨头”、“海上大庆”。
    船员们说：大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。几年来，南海一五五轮党支部组织船员学习毛主席著作，特别是反复学习毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，船员们以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人，同美帝国主义进行了针锋相对的英勇斗争。他们对美帝国主义军舰、飞机的挑衅威胁，就是不怕，就是敢顶，就是坚决做到装得上，卸得下，打不断，走得通，成为一支革命化、战斗化的海上运输队。南海一五五轮船员们的斗争实践再一次证明：毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量，产生最大的战斗力。
    去年三月的一个晚上，南海一五五轮在西沙群岛以东，遇到十艘美国军舰，内有一艘航空母舰，它们摆开战斗队形，迎面开过来。其中一艘美国军舰长时间用灯语盘询，进行挑衅。我国南海一五五轮坚决置之不理，一面严密监视着美舰的动向，一面保持原来速度和方向破浪前进。打灯语的美舰曾故意逼近，离我国商船只有四浬，南海一五五轮坚决不答复敌舰的灯语。美舰无可奈何，只好从旁边溜掉。
    去年八月十日拂晓，在距离海南岛铜鼓嘴八十五浬的海面上，南海一五五轮又与美国的一艘雷击舰进行了一场针锋相对的斗争。这艘美国军舰像拦路海盗一样，远远从左前方横驶过来，同时不断发出灯语盘问。南海一五五轮同样不予理睬。这艘美舰开到南海一五五轮前方二浬时，竟耍起无赖，停止前进，挡住一五五轮的去路。这种故意违反国际海上避碰规则的行为，分明是美国军舰有意挑衅。在这紧急的时刻，船长和政委决定：对美舰这种横行霸道的行为，必须顶回去，坚决维护祖国的尊严。于是，船长坚决地下达命令：“航向不变！原速前进！”
    这时，值班操舵的一等水手，怀着满腔的对敌仇恨，坚定地把稳舵盘，直冲敌舰。按照国际海上避碰规则，美国军舰就应该让路，自己走开。到了相隔一浬之遥，美国军舰眼见来势不妙，灰溜溜地急忙开车跑了。船员们指着它说：“当你真敢和我们碰呢，原来是一条怕死狗！”美帝国主义者在英雄的中国海员面前再一次露出了纸老虎的原形。南海一五五轮披着太阳出海前的满天彩霞，胜利地乘风破浪疾进，驶返祖国的怀抱。
    南海一五五轮的海员们时刻牢记毛主席的教导：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”他们在美国专门派出军用飞机跟踪下，同样昂然直驶，无所畏惧。去年六月，南海一五五轮从柬埔寨返国，已被美国飞机连续跟踪了三天三夜。二十天后从祖国开往柬埔寨，又被美机跟踪，时间长达五天五夜。这一次，美国第七舰队先后出动了海军巡逻机多批，轮流进行挑衅，有时一架，有时两三架，不分昼夜跟踪南海一五五轮达一千二百多浬，跟踪的时间长达一百一十九小时。美帝国主义就是这样疯狂地破坏公海航行自由，无耻地创下了军用飞机长时间追踪商船的“世界纪录”。
    前来挑衅的这些美机，绕着南海一五五轮兜圈子，反复俯冲侦察，低空拍照，有时飞得比轮船大桅还低，靠近船舷擦过去。晚上，还常常用强烈探照灯光向轮船驾驶台照射，扰乱驾驶操纵；或向轮船前进方向的海面乱抛发光浮物，扰乱我商船航行，威胁我船员的生命安全。但是，南海一五五轮的船员们，个个都是无产阶级的革命硬骨头。他们坚决粉碎敌机的捣乱，在狂涛怒海中，昂然驶向目的港。白天，美机俯冲拍照，现任船长鲁萍也拿起照相机站在驾驶台顶，拍下美机挑衅的罪证，并把机型编号一一记下。晚上，美机用探照灯照射和抛掷发光浮物，值班驾驶人员就更加聚精会神地了望海面，精密地测算船位，更加精神抖擞地正确操舵夜航，绕过美机投下的一切障碍物，击败敌机扰乱安全航行的阴谋。船员张春、卢锁保等负责监视美机的一举一动，不管风吹雨打，烈日当头，始终坚守岗位。卢锁保在哨位题了一副对联：“了长空，絮云层层搜飞蝇；望阔海，惊涛滚滚捕蛇虫。”
    在南海一五五轮船员们看来，这些张牙舞爪地飞来挑衅的美国飞机，只不过是嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣的飞蝇，只不过是害人的蛇虫，并没有什么了不起。当时的老船长施兴复说：“我们不过是一艘商船，美帝就如此惊慌失措，如临大敌，长时间跟踪。它样子很凶，实际上正是它虚弱的表现。”在美机盘旋、俯冲的嘶鸣声中，不值班的船员们，常常笑谈纸老虎。机匠吴德明风趣地说：“这是约翰逊派专机给咱们‘护航’啦！”水手乔忠云说：“美机交接班制度倒挺‘健全’，得写信表扬约翰逊这个护航大队长。”在美机挑衅下，船员们跟过去一样大唱革命歌曲。《大海航行靠舵手》、《风雷之歌》和《解放南方》的雄壮歌声，冲破了美机的嘶鸣，震荡在越南南方金瓯角、昆仑岛外几十浬的公海上。
    毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，给了他们巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。几年来，船员们把这一著名论断的语录悬挂在船上的会议厅，反复进行学习，活学活用。船员们都说，是毛泽东思想照亮了他们战斗的航程，使他们敢于以一条普通商船，在茫茫大海上压倒美帝国主义前来挑衅的飞机和军舰，夺取了海上运输的胜利。生火长余广善有一首诗写道：“毛主席著作照船上，船员个个心亮堂，一心一意为革命，援越抗美斗志强。”
    毛主席教导我们：大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。南海一五五轮船员认真贯彻毛主席这一教导，真正发扬了中国人民的革命硬骨头精神。的确，对一艘普通商船来说，前来挑衅的美国军舰、飞机，都算得上大。但是，船员们用毛泽东思想武装起来，有着献身于社会主义祖国和世界革命事业的崇高精神，就无所畏惧，就什么都不怕。  新华社记者（附图片）
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。南海一五五轮船员不论在航行中或港口上，坚持学习毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己。这是船员们在学习和讨论毛主席著作。　新华社稿
