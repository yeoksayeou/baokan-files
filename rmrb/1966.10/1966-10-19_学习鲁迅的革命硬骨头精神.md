Today, as we are in the midst of the great upsurge of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the passing of Lu Xun, the most courageous and great banner-bearer on China's cultural front. This has great significance both domestically and internationally.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has given Lu Xun the highest praise.

Chairman Mao said: "Lu Xun is the commander of the Chinese cultural revolution. He is not only a great literary figure but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary. Lu Xun's bones are the hardest. He has not the slightest trace of servility or flattery. This is the most precious quality for the people of a colony and a semi-colony. Lu Xun is the vanguard on the cultural front, representing the majority of the nation, charging into the enemy's ranks with the greatest correctness, courage, decisiveness, loyalty, and enthusiasm. The direction Lu Xun points to is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation."

In commemorating Lu Xun, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and carry forward and develop Lu Xun's spirit of proletarian revolutionary ruthlessness.

Lu Xun is a critic and rebel against the old world. He emerged from a feudal society in decline but could "counterattack" and "strike the enemy to death." He harbored deep hatred for the semi-feudal, semi-colonial old society and detested the old ideas and old culture that maintained the old system. He despised, exposed, lashed, and swept away all reactionary forces and reactionary cultures that oppressed, deceived, and poisoned the people. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must learn from Lu Xun's spirit of rebellion, thoroughly criticize the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and establish the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. We must establish the thought of Mao Zedong and let it occupy every position.

In battle, Lu Xun always stood firmly and had great heroic spirit. The enemy subjected him to various political persecutions and cultural "sieges." Those who wore the cloak of proletarian revolution but followed the capitulationist line of Wang Ming, such as the Zhou Yang clique, maliciously attacked and slandered him. They shot at him from all directions, putting him in a situation of being surrounded on all sides. However, Lu Xun was a tall, independent tree, not a small grass that bends to the sides. He held high the banner of proletarian revolutionary culture, firmly supported Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and was unyielding against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Lu Xun's political direction was always clear, never retreating in the face of difficulties, and never wavering in the face of setbacks. In the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must learn from Lu Xun's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to revolution. We must resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly oppose the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and defend Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and Mao Zedong Thought to the death. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought must be overthrown.

Lu Xun showed no mercy or leniency to any enemy. He would not show the slightest pity even if the enemy was in a miserable state, nor would he stop if the enemy was on the verge of death. He advocated "finishing off the fallen dog" and "if you hit, hit to the end." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must carry forward Lu Xun's spirit of "finishing off the fallen dog." We must be unyielding and merciless towards the enemy. We must resolutely overthrow, smash, and expose to shame the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the counter-revolutionary revisionists, and all the monsters and demons, so that they will never be able to rise again.

The storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has aroused extreme hostility from the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and all reactionaries. They seize every opportunity to slander and attack us maliciously. The Soviet revisionists even shamelessly use the pretext of "commemorating" Lu Xun to clamor and slander the great Communist warrior Lu Xun as a bourgeois humanitarian and a defender of old culture, using this to attack our cultural revolution. These traitors to the proletariat will find no pretext to attack our cultural revolution on the great Communist warrior Lu Xun. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is an irresistible historical trend. Anyone who tries to block this trend will surely be met with a bloody nose. Lu Xun said well: "Anyone who obstructs this path, whether ancient or modern, human or ghost, must be trampled down."

"With a stern brow facing a thousand accusing fingers, and a bowed head willing to be an ox for the children," these two lines of Lu Xun's poetry are a high summary of his revolutionary worldview. In his long years of struggle, under the guidance and inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, Lu Xun tirelessly pursued the revolutionary truth of the proletariat, thoroughly broke with the ideological consciousness of all exploiting classes and old traditional concepts, and finally became a great Communist warrior. We learn from Lu Xun and must be like him, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our souls, and bravely advancing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution amidst the storm of struggle!

### 学习鲁迅的革命硬骨头精神

    学习鲁迅的革命硬骨头精神
    今天，我们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，纪念我国文化战线上最英勇的伟大旗手鲁迅逝世三十周年，无论在国内和国际上，都有着极为重要的意义。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，对鲁迅曾经给予了极高的评价。
    毛主席说：“鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家。鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”
    我们纪念鲁迅，一定要遵循毛主席的教导，继承和发扬鲁迅的无产阶级的革命硬骨头精神。
    鲁迅是旧世界的批判者、造反者。他是从正在溃败的封建社会中出来的，但他会“杀回马枪”，“致强敌于死命”。他对半封建半殖民地的旧社会刻骨仇恨，对维护旧制度的旧思想、旧文化深恶痛绝。一切压迫人民，愚弄人民，毒害人民的反动势力和反动文化，他都憎恶之，暴露之，鞭挞之，扫荡之。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们就是要学习鲁迅的造反精神，大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，大立毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    鲁迅在战斗中始终旗帜鲜明、立场坚定，具有大无畏的英雄气概。敌人对他进行了种种政治迫害，文化“围剿”。披着无产阶级革命外衣，执行王明投降主义路线的周扬一伙，对他进行了恶意的攻击，无耻的中伤。明枪暗箭，使他处于层层包围、内外夹攻之中。但是，鲁迅是一株独立支持的大树，不是向两旁偏倒的小草。他高举无产阶级革命文化的大旗，坚决拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级的反动路线势不两立。鲁迅的政治方向始终是明确的，不因困难而退缩，不因挫折而动摇。在无产阶级文化大革命的风浪中，我们要学习鲁迅的敢于斗争、敢于革命的精神，一定要誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对资产阶级的反动路线，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，就打倒谁。
    鲁迅对任何敌人从不纵恶和姑息。他决不因敌人被打得狼狈不堪而有丝毫的怜悯，更不因敌人已经奄奄一息而就此住手。他主张“打落水狗”，“要打就得打到底”。我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，就要发扬鲁迅这种“打落水狗”的精神，对待敌人决不心软，决不留情。我们要坚决把一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，把那些反革命修正主义分子，把一切牛鬼蛇神，统统斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，让他们永世不得翻身。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，引起了以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派的极端仇视。他们利用一切机会，对我们进行恶毒的诽谤和攻击。苏联修正主义者，甚至无耻地以“纪念”鲁迅为幌子，吵吵嚷嚷，把伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅诬蔑为资产阶级的人道主义者和旧文化的维护者，借以攻击我国的文化大革命。这些无产阶级的叛徒们，在伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅身上，要想找到攻击我国文化革命的任何借口，都是枉费心机的。我国无产阶级文化大革命，是不可阻挡的历史潮流。谁要阻挡这个潮流，就一定会碰得头破血流。鲁迅说得好：苟有阻碍这前途者，不管是古是今，是人是鬼，全部踏倒他。
    “横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”，鲁迅这两句诗，是他革命世界观的高度概括。鲁迅在长期的斗争生活中，在毛泽东思想的引导和鼓舞下，不倦地追求无产阶级的革命真理，彻底地同一切剥削阶级的意识形态和旧的传统观念决裂，终于成了伟大的共产主义战士。我们学习鲁迅，就要像他那样，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，在无产阶级文化大革命中，迎着斗争的暴风雨奋勇前进！
