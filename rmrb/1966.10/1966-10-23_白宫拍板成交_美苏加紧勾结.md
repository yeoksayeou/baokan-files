President Johnson is "highly inspired" by the results of the US-Soviet talks. He told Gromyko as he saw him off: "You must remember what I said!"

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, recent American reactionary publications have extensively discussed the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and US President Johnson in Washington, highlighting the new developments in US-Soviet collusion. They joyfully celebrate the strengthening of this collusion and strongly endorse and support the Soviet revisionist leadership's increasingly blatant policy of colluding with the US against China.

The Washington Post published an article on the 15th detailing some of the "most exciting moments" from Johnson's secret meeting with Gromyko on the 10th. The article stated, "This meeting has made Johnson highly inspired about the prospects for improving East-West relations. After Gromyko disappeared through the back door, Johnson enthusiastically said, 'I have never been so inspired.'"

The report revealed that during the meeting, Johnson mentioned that the US's use of the "bombing halt" tactic at the end of last year and the beginning of this year was a result of accepting the Soviet "appeal"; he asked Gromyko to continue serving the US on the Vietnam issue. The report said that at this point, "Gromyko chuckled," showing "cautious interest" in the matter. As Gromyko prepared to leave, "Johnson, in a friendly manner, put his arm around Gromyko's shoulder and poked his chest with his finger, saying, 'You must remember what I said!'"

The Christian Science Monitor also published an article on the 17th, hailing the Johnson-Gromyko talks as the most obvious and concrete thaw in US-Soviet relations since Khrushchev and Eisenhower created the "Spirit of Camp David."

The article also pointed out that the development of relations between the Soviet leaders and the US is in "tandem" with their expansion of anti-China actions. Therefore, the article believes that this development in US-Soviet relations "may prove to be more enduring than previous instances" and "may go further."

    白宫拍板成交　美苏加紧勾结
    约翰逊对美苏会谈的结果感到“无比鼓舞”。他在送别葛罗米柯时说：“你可得记住我说的话啊！”
    据新华社二十日讯　美国反动报刊最近环绕苏联外交部长葛罗米柯同美国总统约翰逊在华盛顿的会谈，广泛议论美苏勾结的新发展。它们兴高采烈地欢呼这种勾结的加强，并且大力赞扬和支持苏联修正主义领导集团日益露骨地推行联美反华的叛卖路线。
    《华盛顿邮报》十五日刊载的一篇报道，追述了约翰逊十日同葛罗米柯秘密会谈的一些“最精采的情节”。报道说，“这次会谈使得约翰逊对于改善东西方关系的前景感到无比鼓舞。他在葛罗米柯从后门走得不见踪影之后热情洋溢地说：‘我感到前所未有的鼓舞。’”
    报道透露，约翰逊在会谈中提到，美国在去年底今年初施展“停炸诱和”的手法，是接受苏联“呼吁”的结果；他要求葛罗米柯在越南问题上继续为美国效劳。报道说，这时，“葛罗米柯咯咯地笑了起来”，对这个问题“表现出审慎的兴趣”。在葛罗米柯准备离开时，“约翰逊友好地搂着葛罗米柯的肩膀，用手指捅了一下他的胸口说：‘你可得记住我说的话啊！’”
    《基督教科学箴言报》也在十七日发表文章，欢呼约翰逊—葛罗米柯的会谈是自从赫鲁晓夫同艾森豪威尔搞出“戴维营精神”以来，美苏关系“最明显、最具体的解冻”。
    文章还指出，苏联领导人同美国关系的发展，是同他们扩大反华行动的“步调一致”的，因此，文章认为，这次美苏关系的发展“可能证明比前几次更为持久”，并且“可能走得更远”。
