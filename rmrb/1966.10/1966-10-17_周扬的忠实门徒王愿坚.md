Edition: 6

	Wang Yanjian, who was praised by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang as a "rare and precious" and "most accomplished" writer, is a class enemy who infiltrated the Party and the military. For more than a decade, under the guise of "writing about revolutionary wars" and "writing about old cadres," he has been engaged in evil activities against the Party and socialism.

	During several major political movements of the socialist revolution, Wang Yanjian always stood on the reactionary side, launching vicious attacks on the Party and the people. In 1955, during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, he published the novel "Three Notes," which obliquely attacked the Party's rural policies and incited farmers to turn against the Party. In 1957, he became a spearhead for the rightist elements of the bourgeoisie in their frenzied attacks on the Party, viciously slandering the Party's leadership of literature and art as "layer upon layer of control, too tightly bound," and openly calling for the Party to step down. In 1958, he collaborated with domestic and foreign reactionaries, publishing the poisonous weed "Rest," using the opportunity to say, "We not only have heroes who died in battle, but also martyrs who died from overwork," viciously slandering the Great Leap Forward. In 1963, he published another poisonous weed, "Financial Management," shouting slogans like "glorious isolation," defending rightist opportunists, and inciting rightist opportunists and ghosts and snakes to resist to the end.

	In many of his "works," Wang Yanjian deliberately distorted the history of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, portraying the great Long March as miserable and bleak. In his novel "Party Dues," he openly attributed the errors of "Left" opportunism and escapeism to Chairman Mao, not only distorting history but also directly aiming his attacks at our red sun, Chairman Mao.

	In Wang Yanjian's writings, the revolutionary war is depicted as an endless sea of suffering. Whether it is the heroic Red Army soldiers or the revolutionary people in the base areas, they are all struggling in the abyss of death. In his works, there is no sign of the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, no indication of the just nature of the revolutionary war and its inevitable victory, and no display of lofty revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism. On the contrary, he spared no effort to serve the "three harmonies" line of Khrushchev's revisionism, advocating bourgeois "human love," slandering the revolutionary war as destroying "personal happiness," and extensively promoting things like "mother-daughter affection," "husband-wife affection," "true and false father-son affection," and "father-in-law and son-in-law affection," peddling revisionist goods. Wang Yanjian is indeed a capable propagandist for Zhou Yang's revisionist literary line.

    周扬的忠实门徒王愿坚
    被反革命修正主义分子周扬吹捧为
  “难能可贵的”“最有成就的”“作家”王愿坚，是个混进党内军内的阶级异己分子。十多年来，他打着“写革命战争”“写老干部”的幌子，干着反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当。
    在社会主义革命的几次重大政治运动中，王愿坚都站在反动立场，向党向人民进行恶毒的攻击。一九五五年农业合作化高潮时，他抛出了小说《三张纸条》，含沙射影地攻击党的农村政策，挑拨农民和党的血肉关系。一九五七年，他充当资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的急先锋，咬牙切齿地污蔑党对文艺的领导是“层层节制，扣得太死”，公然叫嚷要党下台。一九五八年，他又配合国内外反动派的蠢动，抛出了毒草《休息》，借题发挥，说“我们不但有战死的英雄，也有累死的烈士”，恶毒地污蔑大跃进。一九六三年，他抛出了另一棵毒草《理财》，叫嚷什么“光荣孤立”，为右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，鼓动右倾机会主义分子和牛鬼蛇神顽抗到底。
    王愿坚在他的许多“作品”里，肆意歪曲中国革命斗争的历史，把伟大的长征写得凄凄惨惨。他在小说《党费》里，公然地把“左”倾机会主义的逃跑主义错误，算到毛主席的账上，不仅歪曲了历史，而且把进攻的矛头直接指向我们心中的红太阳毛主席。
    在王愿坚的笔下，革命战争是无边苦海，不论是英雄的红军战士还是根据地的革命人民，都在死亡的深渊里挣扎。在他的作品里，看不到毛泽东思想的无比巨大的威力，看不到革命战争的正义性质和必然胜利的前景，看不到高昂的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神。相反，他不遗余力地为赫鲁晓夫修正主义的“三和路线”效劳，宣扬资产阶级的“人类之爱”，污蔑革命战争破坏了“个人幸福”，大肆渲染什么“母女情”“夫妻情”“真假父子情”“丈人和女婿之情”等等，推销修正主义黑货。王愿坚不愧为周扬修正主义文艺路线的得力吹鼓手。
