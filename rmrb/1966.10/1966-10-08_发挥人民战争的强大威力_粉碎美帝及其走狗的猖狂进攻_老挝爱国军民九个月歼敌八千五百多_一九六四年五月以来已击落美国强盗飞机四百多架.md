The patriotic military and civilian population of Laos have fully exploited the immense power of people's war. From January to September this year, they bravely fought a defensive battle, smashing the frenzied attacks of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs on the liberated areas. They annihilated a total of 8,533 enemy troops.

The radio station said that during this period, the patriotic military and civilian population of Laos shot down nearly 200 American aggressor aircraft, seized tens of tons of weapons and military supplies, and recovered many areas previously occupied by the enemy. They also liberated more than 10,000 residents. At the same time, they achieved great success in the campaign against bandits.

The radio station pointed out: U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are unwilling to admit defeat. Recently, they have been intensifying their preparations, mobilizing troops, and planning to launch a large-scale new offensive against the liberated areas during the upcoming dry season.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, on October 2, the anti-aircraft defense forces of the liberation army in the province of Xieng Ngeun shot down an intruding U.S. F-104 jet fighter and damaged a helicopter.

Previously, on September 9, the armored forces of the liberation army in Xieng Ngeun Province shot down another U.S. F-104 jet fighter in the Mang Rung area.

The radio station said that from May 17, 1964, to October 2 this year, the patriotic military and civilian population of Laos shot down a total of 411 American aggressor aircraft and damaged hundreds more.

Another broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on October 7 said that in September, more than 31,500 people from various ethnic groups and sectors in the provinces of Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, Phongsaly, and Xieng Ngeun held 126 meetings. They strongly protested and condemned U.S. imperialism and its running dogs for violating the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos issue, destroying the Lao National Unity Government, and for their frenzied attacks on the liberated areas of Laos, as well as for sending aircraft to bomb and strafe the liberated areas.
