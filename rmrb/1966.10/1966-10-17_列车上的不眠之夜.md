On a night in September, a special train filled with Red Guards departed from Shenyang Station, the largest transportation hub in Northeast China, heading towards the capital, Beijing, the birthplace of the Cultural Revolution.

Inside each car, the collective recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations and joyful singing drowned out the sound of the speeding wheels.

Some male and female students wearing bright red Red Guard armbands were busy moving about with thermoses in hand.

In Car 10, three female Red Guards sat by a window. They would occasionally glance at the passing station lights outside the window or ask the conductor what time it was and when they would arrive in Beijing. When the conductor told them they would arrive in Beijing the next morning, a Red Guard with a short braid said anxiously, "I wish I could fly straight to Beijing and to Chairman Mao's side!" This sentiment was shared by all 2,000-plus Red Guards on the train.

Someone found out that the train they were on was the same one that had fought against the floods, and that the crew on board was the famous "March 8th" crew. The current conductor was a well-known "Five Good" model and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from Shenyang. The Red Guards decided to invite the conductor to meet them and talk. Coincidentally, the conductor, Li Guirui, was passing by, and they pulled her to their seats.

"Comrades, you are so fortunate!" Li Guirui hugged a 12 or 13-year-old female Red Guard and sighed, "I see you all taking the special train to Beijing, to see Chairman Mao. I am so happy for you. I never had such a happy childhood. In the old society, my father was taken away to be a laborer and died outside, and I had to beg on the streets with my mother when I was very young... how could I have ridden a train?" The young Red Guards stood by the conductor, listening silently to Li Guirui's denunciation of the old society. The conductor's words and tears stirred up the Red Guards' intense hatred for the old world, and many of them clenched their fists involuntarily.

A few Red Guards returning from Anshan to Beijing heard that there was an old Communist Party member on the train who had fought against the floods seven years ago and was working in the baggage car. They decided to visit him. At two in the morning, when the train left Shanhaiguan Station, four Red Guards from the capital appeared in the baggage car at the front of the train. They talked with the old hero until dawn.

A sleepless night passed, and the first light of day shone into the cars.

Several Red Guards from Shenyang Yucai School, sitting in Car 10, read Chairman Mao's quotations in the dim morning light. The girl with the short braid left her seat, carrying a thermos, and went from seat to seat, pouring water for her comrades having breakfast. One thermos, two thermoses, three thermoses... the sweat beads on the tip of her nose kept rolling down. Only after her comrades had finished eating and drinking did she return to her seat, pour herself a cup of water, and start eating her breakfast. The other Red Guards each took a broom and a mop and began cleaning the train.

When the train left Tianjin Station, the conductor announced that the next stop was the final destination, Beijing. The entire train erupted in excitement. Some pulled their comrades to the windows; some were so excited they couldn't sit still and ran to the door to wait, hoping to be the first to step onto Beijing Station; some took out their diaries and recorded this exciting moment. A young woman from the coastal city of Luda Normal School leaned against the window and wrote: "The train of the times is rushing forward, and the green fields are spread out before my eyes. With the wheels spinning fast, my heart is beating wildly. How can I not be excited? We are about to arrive at the capital of our motherland, the center of the world revolution—Beijing, and we are about to be by the side of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao, you are the eternal red sun in our hearts... Dear Party, beloved leader Chairman Mao, we will not disappoint your expectations. We will study revolutionary experiences seriously in Beijing. We will bring the revolutionary spark from Beijing back to the coastal city and let it burn fiercely!"

The train slowly pulled into the capital's Yongdingmen Station, and the welcoming drums for out-of-town revolutionary students and teachers rang out loudly on the platform.

    列车上的不眠之夜
    九月的一个夜晚，一列满载红卫兵的专车，由东北最大的交通枢纽沈阳站，向祖国的首都、文化大革命的策源地北京疾驶。
    各个车厢里，集体朗读毛主席语录声，欢乐的歌声，淹没了车轮飞奔的声响。
    一些戴着鲜红夺目的红卫兵袖章的男女学生，手提着开水壶，往来不停。
    在十号车厢的一个车窗下，坐着三个女红卫兵。她们一会儿瞧瞧窗外闪过的火车站的灯火，一会儿向走过来的列车员询问几点钟了，啥时候才能到北京？当列车员告诉她们明天上午才能到北京之后，一个扎短辫的红卫兵焦急地说：“我恨不得一下子就飞到北京，飞到毛主席的身边！”这句话，也正是此刻全列车上两千多名红卫兵的共同心情。
    不知是哪一个红卫兵，打听到他们乘坐的这趟列车，就是曾经同洪水搏斗过的英雄列车，车上的包乘组就是著名的“三八”包乘组，现任车长又是沈阳著名的五好标兵、学习毛主席著作积极分子，于是大家一致决定请列车长跟他们见见面，谈谈话。巧得很，列车长李桂茹正好从他们身边走过，大家便拥上去把她拉到了座席上。
      “同学们，你们多么幸福啊！”李桂茹把一个十二三岁的女红卫兵搂在自己的怀里，感慨地说：“我看到同学们今天乘坐着专车去首都北京，去见毛主席，我真替你们高兴。我就没有过这样幸福的童年。在吃人的旧社会，我的父亲被抓去当劳工，死在外边，我很小的时候就跟着妈妈沿街乞讨……，哪里能坐上火车呀？”红卫兵小将们站在列车长的身旁，鸦雀无声地倾听着李桂茹对旧社会的控诉。列车长的话和她脸上的泪水，激起了红卫兵们对旧世界的无比仇恨，许多人情不自禁地握紧了拳头。
    几个从鞍山回北京的红卫兵，打听到这趟英雄列车上，还有一位七年前曾在列车上同洪水搏斗过的老共产党员在行李车上工作，便决定去访问他。凌晨两点，当列车从山海关站开出的时候，四名首都红卫兵已出现在列车最前部的行李车上，她们同老英雄一直谈到东方破晓。
    一个不眠之夜过去了，曙光射进了车厢。
    坐在十号车厢里的沈阳育才学校的几个红卫兵，趁着窗外射进来的黎明光亮，默读了一阵毛主席语录。那个扎短辫的女孩子离开了座席，提着一把开水壶，逐座为正在用早餐的战友们送水。一壶、两壶、三壶……她鼻子尖上的汗珠不断地滚下来。直到战友们吃好喝足，她才回到自己的座席，倒上一杯水，开始吃早点。另外几个红卫兵又各自拿起条帚和地板擦子，开始清扫列车。
    当列车离开天津车站，列车员宣告前方停车站就是终点站北京的时候，整个列车沸腾了。有的拉着伙伴们一齐涌向车窗；有的激动得实在坐不住了，干脆背起背包早早跑到车门口去等着，争取第一个踏上北京站；有的掏出日记本，记下了这个激动人心的时刻。一个来自海滨之城旅大师范的女青年，伏在车窗前写道：“时代的列车在飞奔着，绿色的田野展现在我的眼前，随着车轮飞快的转动，我的心在激烈地跳动着。啊，我怎能不激动呢？我们马上就要到达祖国的首都、世界革命的中心——北京了，就要到我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的身边了！毛主席呀，您是我们心中永远不落的红太阳……。亲爱的党啊，敬爱的领袖毛主席，我们一定不辜负您对我们的希望，一定在北京认真地学习革命经验。我们一定要把北京革命的火种带回去，让它猛烈的燃烧在海滨之城！”
    列车缓缓驶进首都永定门车站，站台上欢迎外地革命师生的锣鼓声热烈地敲响起来。　本报记者
