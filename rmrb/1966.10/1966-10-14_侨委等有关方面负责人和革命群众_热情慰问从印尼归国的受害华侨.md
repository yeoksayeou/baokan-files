On the morning of the 11th, Vice Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Vice Chairman of the Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, Lin Yixin, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province and Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, Zhao Zhuoyun, and others, visited the temporary residence of overseas Chinese returning from Indonesia to express their warm regards. Lin Yixin and others encouraged them to turn their hatred towards the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia into a great force, actively participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.

Today, many revolutionary youths and Red Guards from Zhanjiang City and other places who came to Zhanjiang for revolutionary linkages also came to express their warm regards to the injured overseas Chinese. In the past two days, workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary youths, and Red Guards from all over the country have also sent enthusiastic telegrams and letters to the injured overseas Chinese.
