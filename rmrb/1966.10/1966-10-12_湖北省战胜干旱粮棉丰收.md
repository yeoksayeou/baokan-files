The vast rural population of Hubei Province, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has overcome a severe drought and achieved a bumper harvest. From the harvest situation in various places, it can be seen that this year's grain and cotton production in most regions can reach the level of last year's bumper harvest, and some places even have a slight increase in production compared to last year. As of now, the cotton sold by the masses in various places to the state has already exceeded that of the same period last year by 1.7 times. The grain storage tasks in regions such as Xiaogan and Xianning have been basically completed.

    湖北省战胜干旱粮棉丰收
    湖北广大农村人民公社社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜严重干旱，取得了丰收。从各地收获情况看，大部分地区今年的粮、棉产量，可以达到丰收的去年的水平，其中有些地方还比去年略有增产。到最近为止，各地社员向国家出售的棉花，已超过去年同期一点七倍。孝感、咸宁等地区的粮食入仓任务已基本完成。
