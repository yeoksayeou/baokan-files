After visiting several schools during the day, we returned in the evening to our "warm home"—the Fourth Reception Station for Revolutionary Teachers and Students from Outside Beijing.

In late September, the Beijing nights are quite cool. As soon as we opened the window, the tall television tower caught our attention. At the top of the tower, a red star was shining brightly. A row of red neon lights with gold borders on the tower's waist displayed the words "Long Live Chairman Mao." Ah, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the eternal red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people around the world. You are the guiding light for the revolutionary people of the world. It is you who personally initiated this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, to temper and cultivate a new generation, to spread the revolutionary spark throughout the country, you have sent us to Beijing to make connections, and you have made the best arrangements for our lives without overlooking any detail. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, how can we repay your care and support for us? We must listen to your words, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the middle of the night, I woke up and heard the door being pushed open slightly. Soon, someone came in sideways, holding a long flashlight, and quietly walked to the side of a classmate, covering them with a quilt, then closing the window. After that, they tiptoed out of the dormitory. When he turned around, I saw that it was the director of the Fourth Reception Station. The staff at the reception station are like this. Every night, they take turns covering us with quilts and closing the windows, fearing that we might catch a cold. During the day, they handle our meals, arrange visits, and manage a thousand and one miscellaneous tasks; at night, they are still worrying about us.

Later, I learned that all the reception stations in Beijing that accommodate revolutionary teachers and students from outside the city have staff on duty every night. While we are in sweet dreams, they are still serving us. Thinking of this, I couldn't help but shed tears of excitement. Our revolutionary family is so warm!

Beijing, Beijing, because our great revolutionary leader Chairman Mao lives here, you have become a star that shines forever red in the universe, a star that people around the world look up to! Coming here, we feel incredibly fortunate!

    一颗永远闪光的红星
    在几个学校参观了一天，晚上又回到了我们“温暖的家”——外地革命师生第四接待站。
    九月下旬的北京，晚上天气很凉爽，一打开窗户，高大的电视塔架吸引了我们。高大的塔顶，一颗红星闪闪发光。塔腰一排金边红字的霓虹灯，映出了“毛主席万岁”几个大字。啊，毛主席呀毛主席，您是全世界革命人民心中不落的红太阳，您是全世界革命人民的指路明灯，是您亲自发起了这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。今天，您为了锻炼和培养我们新的一代，为了把革命的火种撒遍全国，又要我们到北京来串连，并且无微不至地给我们的生活作了最好的安排。毛主席呀毛主席，我们如何报答您老人家对我们的关怀和支持呢？我们一定要听您的话，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    半夜，一觉醒来，只听见门轻轻地推开了一道缝，紧接着侧着身进来了一个人，手拿长电筒，轻轻地走到同学的旁边，为他们盖好了被子，又把窗户关好，然后轻手轻脚地走出了寝室。当他一转脸，我看清了，原来就是第四接待站的指导员。接待站的干部就是这样。每天晚上轮流给我们盖被子、关窗户，惟恐我们受了凉。他们白天为我们料理伙食，安排参观，处理千头万绪的杂事；而晚上还在为我们操心。
    后来我才得知，全北京住有外地革命师生的接待站，晚上都有工作人员轮流值班，当我们在甜蜜的睡乡里的时候，他们还在为我们服务。想到这里，我不禁流下了激动的眼泪，我们的革命大家庭是多么温暖呵！
    北京呀北京，因为我们伟大的革命领袖毛主席住在这里，你成了全世界人民仰望的、宇宙间永远闪光的一颗红星！我们来到这里，感到无比的幸福！
