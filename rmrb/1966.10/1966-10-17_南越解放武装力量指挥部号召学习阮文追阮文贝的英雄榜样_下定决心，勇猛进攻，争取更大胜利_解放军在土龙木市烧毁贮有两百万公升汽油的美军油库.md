The Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam has issued a directive calling on the main forces, local forces, and guerrillas of the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam to extensively carry out activities commemorating the second anniversary of the martyrdom of hero Nguyen Van Thieu.

This directive also calls for learning from the great deeds of hero Nguyen Van Bay, who is in the style of Nguyen Van Thieu.

The directive of the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam states: All military and civilian people of South Vietnam should take Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Van Bay as examples, strengthen their revolutionary spirit, resolutely decide to annihilate the enemy, and launch more fierce and continuous attacks on the enemy to achieve greater new victories.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on October 15, the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam recently published a commentary in the "Liberation Army" newspaper, calling on the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam to learn from the heroic spirit of Nguyen Van Bay, who is in the style of Nguyen Van Thieu, and more bravely annihilate the American aggressors.

The commentary says that Nguyen Van Bay is an ordinary patriotic youth in South Vietnam. He lives in the extraordinary and passionate revolutionary life of the entire nation. However, when the country and the people need him to make sacrifices, he does not hesitate to bravely sacrifice himself to exchange for more enemy deaths, carrying forward the nation's unyielding tradition and great heroic spirit.

The commentary says that Nguyen Van Bay is indeed a second Nguyen Van Thieu. Although Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Van Bay engaged in two different revolutionary tasks in two different environments, they both encountered the same extremely sharp and fierce battle situations. They both know how to choose the most thorough solution for a revolutionary soldier, that is, only to attack, decisively seize victory, be loyal and brave, and be willing to die gloriously rather than live shamefully and surrender to the invaders and traitors.

The commentary says that after Nguyen Van Thieu issued the call to die unyielding, thousands of young "anti-American heroes" and thousands of outstanding heroic soldiers emerged in South Vietnam. After Nguyen Van Bay's historic and heroic sacrifice, it can be believed that every young person in South Vietnam, every soldier of the Liberation Armed Forces, will live, fight, and win like Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Van Bay.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on October 16, the Liberation Army in South Vietnam burned down an American oil depot storing two million liters of gasoline in the heavily guarded city of Tu Du on the morning of October 8.

Just as the enemy was still in shock, the Liberation Army attacked another nearby gasoline depot. The fires from these two depots quickly spread, causing damage to the nearby enemy postal and telecommunications station. (Accompanying picture)

    南越解放武装力量指挥部号召学习阮文追阮文贝的英雄榜样
    下定决心，勇猛进攻，争取更大胜利
    解放军在土龙木市烧毁贮有两百万公升汽油的美军油库
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方解放武装力量指挥部最近发布指示，号召越南南方解放武装力量主力部队、地方部队和游击队，广泛开展纪念英雄阮文追就义两周年的活动。
    这个指示还要求学习阮文追式的英雄阮文贝的伟大事迹。
    越南南方解放武装力量指挥部的指示说：我们全体越南南方军民要以阮文追和阮文贝为榜样，增强革命斗志，下定消灭敌人的高度决心，更加猛烈地、连续地向敌人进攻，争取更巨大的新胜利。
    据新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方解放武装力量指挥部机关报《解放军报》最近发表评论，号召越南南方解放武装力量学习阮文追式的英雄阮文贝烈士的崇高革命英雄主义精神，更加勇敢地消灭美国侵略强盗。
    评论说，阮文贝是越南南方一个非常平凡的爱国青年。他生活在整个民族的不平凡的热气腾腾的革命生活之中。但在祖国和人民需要他作出牺牲的时候，他毫不犹疑地勇于用自己的壮烈牺牲来换取敌人更多的死亡，把民族的坚强不屈的传统和伟大的英雄气魄发扬光大。
    评论说，阮文贝不愧为第二个阮文追。阮文追和阮文贝虽然干不同的两项革命工作，处在两个不同的活动环境，但都遇到相同的极其尖锐和激烈的战斗境遇，都懂得选择一个革命战士的最彻底的解决办法，那就是，只有进攻，坚决夺取胜利，赤胆忠诚，宁愿光荣地死去，也不愿意可耻地活着、向侵略者与卖国贼投降。
    评论说，在阮文追发出宁死不屈的呼声以后，越南南方涌现出了数以千计的年青的“歼美勇士”，数以千计的非常出色的英雄战士。
  在阮文贝具有历史意义的壮烈牺牲以后，可以相信：每个越南南方青年，解放武装力量的每个战士，都会像阮文追和阮文贝那样生活、战斗和胜利。
    新华社河内十六日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放军十月八日上午在敌人严密控制的土龙木市，烧毁了一个贮藏有二百万公升汽油的美军油库。
    正当敌人惊魂未定的时候，解放军又袭击了附近的另一个汽油库。这两个油库的大火迅速向四处蔓延，使附近的敌人邮电站也受到损失。（附图片）
