Comrades and friends:

Today is the great day marking the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, and on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I extend the warmest greetings to the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the entire nation, to the revolutionary students and teachers, to the Red Guards and other revolutionary youth organizations, to the revolutionary people of all nationalities, and to the revolutionary cadres throughout the country! I also express my heartfelt welcome to our friends from all over the world!

The 17 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been extraordinary years. In our country, these have been 17 years of tremendous upheaval. In the world, these have also been 17 years of tremendous upheaval.

Comrade Mao Zedong led the Chinese people through a long and arduous revolutionary struggle. The enemies at home and abroad were once powerful, but they were ultimately overthrown and driven away by the Chinese people. The imperialists led by the United States, all reactionaries, and modern revisionists—these paper tigers—have all been exposed by the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of various countries.

In just 17 short years, the Chinese people have completely transformed their past. This is the great achievement of the Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong. We believe that all oppressed peoples and nations around the world will, according to their own national conditions, forge their own paths and achieve ultimate victory, just as the Chinese people have done.

Today, we are celebrating this great day amidst the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new and creative revolution carried out after the proletariat has seized political power. This revolution aims to overthrow a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to sweep away all the ghosts and monsters in society, to destroy the old ideas, culture, habits, and customs of the exploiting classes, and to establish new ideas, culture, habits, and customs of the proletariat. The goal is to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and develop the socialist system. The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat tells us that if we do not do this, revisionism will take over, and capitalist restoration will occur. In our country, if such a situation arises, we will return to the old path of colonialism, semi-colonialism, feudalism, and semi-feudalism. Imperialism and reactionaries will once again ride roughshod over the people. The importance of our Cultural Revolution is very clear.

Now, hundreds of millions of people have been mobilized. Revolutionary people are exultant, while the reactionary bourgeoisie is in disarray. We are advancing. We have laid the foundation for a great victory.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution promotes the ideological transformation of the people, thereby becoming a powerful driving force for the development of socialist production in our country. This year is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. The industrial production plan for this year is expected to be overfulfilled, and agriculture is expected to have another good harvest. Our scientific and technological achievements are reaching new heights. Our great motherland has never been so prosperous and so full of vitality. Our national defense has never been so strong.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out that throughout the entire socialist historical period, there exists class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there exists a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage in the struggle between these two classes and two roads. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the anti-revolutionary line of the bourgeoisie continues. Those who insist on the wrong line are only a handful of people. They are detached from the people, opposing the people and opposing Mao Zedong Thought, which determines that they will inevitably fail.

Comrades and friends: The current world situation is excellent. The great upheavals of the past few years have shown that the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries will not last long.

The U.S. imperialists are trying to find a way out by launching a world war. We must take this seriously. The current focus of the struggle is in Vietnam. We have made all the necessary preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices to resolutely support our Vietnamese comrades in carrying the anti-American national liberation war to the end. The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party are colluding to engage in deceptive peace talks, aiming to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national revolutionary war, to extinguish the flames of national revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and to extinguish the flames of world revolution. As long as the people of the world keep their eyes open, their plots will not succeed. Twenty years ago, Chairman Mao said that the people of the world should unite to form a united front against U.S. imperialism to defeat U.S. imperialism. The revolutionary peoples of various countries are advancing on this path.

Chairman Mao said: "The people of the world must have the courage to fight, to dare to struggle, to be unafraid of difficulties, and to advance wave upon wave. Then, the whole world will certainly belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed." The future of the world will certainly be like this.

The Chinese people will continue to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the banner of proletarian internationalism, together with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of various countries, to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to the end, and to carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party to the end!

Comrades and friends!

All our achievements and victories have been won under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. They are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thinking of the entire Party and the thinking of the people throughout the country. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the country. We must turn the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must build our great motherland to be even stronger and more prosperous. This is the need of the Chinese people and also the hope of the people of the world.

Long live the people of all nationalities in China!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    在中华人民共和国成立十七周年庆祝大会上
    林彪同志的讲话
    新华社一日讯　林彪同志在中华人民共和国成立十七周年庆祝大会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们，朋友们：
    今天是中华人民共和国成立十七周年的伟大节日。我代表我们伟大领袖毛主席，代表党中央，代表中华人民共和国政府，向全国的工农兵，向全国的革命师生，向革命的红卫兵和其他战斗的青少年组织，向全国各民族的革命人民，向全国的革命干部，致最热烈的敬礼！向来自世界各国的朋友们表示衷心的欢迎！
    中华人民共和国成立十七周年，这是不平常的十七年。在我国，是翻天覆地的十七年。在世界，也是翻天覆地的十七年。
    毛泽东同志领导我国人民进行革命，经历了千辛万苦的曲折道路。国内外的敌人曾经是强大的，但终于被中国人民推翻了，赶跑了。以美国为首的帝国主义者，一切反动派，现代修正主义者，这些纸老虎，都被中国人民和各国革命人民戳穿了。
    中国人民在短短的十七年间，完全改变了过去的面貌。这是毛泽东同志领导的中国人民群众的丰功伟绩。我们相信，全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，都会按照本国的情况，走自己的路，像中国人民一样，夺取最后的胜利。
    今天，我们是在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中来庆祝这个伟大节日的。这场无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级夺取政权以后进行的一种崭新的创造性的大革命。这场大革命，要斗倒一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神，破剥削阶级的四旧，立无产阶级的四新，目的是为着进一步巩固无产阶级专政，发展社会主义制度。国际无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，如果我们不这样做，就会出现修正主义的统治，就会发生资本主义的复辟。在我国，如果出现这种情况，就会回到殖民地半殖民地、封建半封建的老路上去，帝国主义和反动派，就会重新骑在人民头上。我们这场文化大革命的重要性，是很清楚的。
    现在，亿万人民群众发动起来了。革命人民扬眉吐气，反动资产阶级威风扫地。我们正在前进。我们已经奠定了伟大胜利的局面。
    无产阶级文化大革命促使人们思想革命化，因而成为发展我国社会主义生产的强大的推动力。今年是第三个五年计划的第一年。今年的工业生产计划预计可以超额完成，农业可以获得又一个好收成。我国的科学技术正在攀登新的高峰。我们伟大的祖国，从来没有这样繁荣，这样生动活泼。我们的国防从来没有这样强大。
    毛主席早就指出，在整个社会主义的历史时期，存在着无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。无产阶级文化大革命，就是这两个阶级、两条道路斗争的新阶段。在无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反对革命路线的斗争还在继续。那些坚持错误路线的人，只是一小撮人，他们脱离人民，反对人民，反对毛泽东思想，这就决定了他们一定要失败。
    同志们，朋友们：当前的世界是一片大好形势。几年来世界的大动荡表明，以美国为首的帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派，他们的寿命不长了。
    美帝国主义力图从发动一场世界战争中寻找出路。我们必须加以认真对待。当前斗争的焦点在越南。我们已经作好了一切准备。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，正在狼狈为奸，积极搞和谈欺骗的勾当，目的是要扑灭越南人民反美民族革命战争的烈火，扑灭亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族革命斗争的烈火，扑灭世界革命的烈火。只要全世界人民擦亮眼睛，他们的阴谋是不能得逞的。二十年前，毛主席就说过，全世界人民要结成反对美帝国主义的统一战线，来打败美帝国主义。世界各国革命人民，正在这条道路上前进。
    毛主席说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”世界的前途，一定是这样。
    中国人民将继续高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，同全世界马克思列宁主义者一起，同各国革命人民一起，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！
    同志们，朋友们！
    我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们要用毛泽东思想统一全党的思想，统一全国人民群众的思想。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步在全国开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。我们要把全国变成为一个毛泽东思想的大学校。我们要把伟大的祖国建设得更加强盛，更加兴旺。这是我国人民的需要，也是世界各国人民对我们的希望。
    中国各族人民万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
