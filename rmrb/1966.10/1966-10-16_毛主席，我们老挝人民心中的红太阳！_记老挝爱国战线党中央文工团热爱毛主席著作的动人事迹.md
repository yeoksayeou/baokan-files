The walls are adorned with large-character posters written in Lao. A group of Lao men and women gather in front of the posters, some sitting on the floor, others leaning against the wall. Each person holds a red-covered notebook, carefully copying the words one by one.

The posters feature quotations from our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao. The Lao youths copying the quotations are members of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Cultural Troupe, who have come from the front lines of the anti-American struggle.

Chairman Mao's works are the treasure of the revolution. We must study them diligently and become good students of Chairman Mao.

From March to the beginning of October this year, our Lao friends have been visiting and performing in China for half a year. As soon as they set foot on Chinese soil, they eagerly hoped to obtain a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When they received this precious book from Chinese friends, many were moved to tears. Some spontaneously burst into singing "The East Is Red," while others jumped up, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

The Lao friends received the Chinese version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which they couldn't read. However, this did not deter their ardent love for Chairman Mao's works. They asked Chinese translators to translate the Chinese into Lao and write it on large-character posters to hang on the walls of their hotel. Everyone then began copying them diligently. They worked from dawn to dusk, day and night, with some even skipping meals and continuing to copy despite illness. Even the twelve-year-old actor, Mai Xin, neatly copied an entire notebook.

While translating and copying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the Lao friends repeatedly requested that the reception unit purchase several hundred copies of Chairman Mao's works in single volumes and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese. They carried Chairman Mao's books with them wherever they went, reading them on the go. Even when traveling by car, they often read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together. Despite their busy schedule of performances and visits, they published a wall newspaper to exchange learning experiences and wrote numerous study notes. The deputy director of the troupe, Zhan Nong, said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. The more we read, the more we want to read."

Study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, walk the revolutionary path for a lifetime. Transform one's thoughts for a lifetime and serve the people for a lifetime.

In the process of studying Chairman Mao's works, the Lao friends all focused on the word "use." The director of the troupe, Kanma Fu Gong, said, "We must use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds and guide our revolutionary actions."

After studying Chairman Mao's works, the troupe member Tao Zhuang underwent significant changes in his thinking. He excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's works have shown me the direction and taught me the principles of being a revolutionary. I will make studying Chairman Mao's works my duty, follow Chairman Mao's words, and serve the people."

These words of the young actor expressed the shared aspirations of the more than forty Lao friends in the troupe. The singer Wei Lai Wan, after reading Chairman Mao's works, wrote on the cover page of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, walk the revolutionary path for a lifetime. Transform one's thoughts for a lifetime and serve the people for a lifetime."

One morning, the deputy director, Ba Se, met with the reporter. When discussing how Chairman Mao's literary thoughts guide the Lao Patriotic Front's artistic warriors forward, he quoted a passage from Chairman Mao: "To make literature and art a component of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy." Ba Se said, Chairman Mao's teachings have made them clear that literature and art must meet the needs of the suffering working people, serve the revolution, and serve politics. The Lao people are suffering from the barbaric invasion of American imperialism, and they will use this weapon of literature and art to inspire the people and soldiers' fighting spirit, resolutely defeating the invaders.

The Lao Patriotic Front Central Cultural Troupe, born in the midst of war, feels very close to Mao Zedong Thought. Many actors said that Chairman Mao's words resonate deeply with them. They will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, blend in with the Lao farmers and soldiers, learn from them, understand them, and better serve them.

Even during their visit and performances in China, the Lao friends did not miss the opportunity to train among the workers and peasants. Before China's National Day, the friends visited a people's commune in Shandong Province. They went to the fields and saw the commune members plowing the land. They immediately joined in the labor. The musician Lin Tong was the first to pick up a hoe and start working. To work more efficiently, he even took off his shoes and threw them aside. The Lao friends repeatedly requested to be organized for labor. When Chinese friends advised them to take care of their health, they always said, "This is Chairman Mao's teaching. We must learn from the working people." Some actors even said, "Those who do not participate in labor do not understand how to serve the people and may become revisionists!"

The Lao people, relying on the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely drive out American imperialism and achieve true national independence and liberation.

During the troupe's visit to China, the reporter had multiple interactions with them. Many Lao friends we visited said that Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path forward for all revolutionary people worldwide. The Lao people, relying on the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely drive out American imperialism and achieve true national independence and liberation.

Actors Bu Pai, Ma Ni Wan, and Wei Lai Wan have repeatedly gathered with Chinese friends to read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "All the people of the world, unite! Beat back the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the world are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys!" They excitedly told Chinese friends, "Chairman Mao has expressed what is in our hearts. American imperialism appears strong but is actually weak. Only the masses are the true iron wall. The Lao people, tested by long-term struggles, are becoming stronger and stronger in battle!"

A Lao friend, holding Chairman Mao's works in both hands, told the reporter, "The Lao people will encounter various difficulties on their forward march, but as long as they follow Chairman Mao's teachings, make up their minds, fear no sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory, they will definitely achieve the final victory!"

During the troupe's visit to China, they received dozens of letters from relatives and friends back home, repeatedly instructing them to bring back more of Chairman Mao's works upon their return. The troupe member Xiang Tong told the reporter that the warriors of the Lao Patriotic Front love to read Chairman Mao's books. In the forests, in the caves, and in the most difficult environments, they persist in studying Chairman Mao's works. The more than forty Lao friends in the troupe, in addition to each having a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," also brought back over six hundred copies of Chairman Mao's works to their homeland, preparing to give them to their anti-imperialist comrades.

The sun is red, the sun is bright, the sun's rays are endless. Great leader Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts.

In every performance, every visit, and every gathering with Chinese friends, the Lao friends always sing "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman," "I Love to Read Chairman Mao's Book," and "Long Live Chairman Mao" in Chinese, over and over again. They said these songs they will sing thousands and thousands of times to express the Lao people's boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

The great leader Chairman Mao's portraits and images have been carefully collected by the Lao friends, with almost everyone having three or four copies. However, they still cut out Chairman Mao's portraits from newspapers, neatly placing them in their boxes to bring back and give to their relatives and friends. They said the Lao people think of Chairman Mao day and night and all want to see Chairman Mao.

Once, the troupe member Zhan Su went to the Xinhua Bookstore to buy Chairman Mao's books. The clerk gave her a portrait of Chairman Mao. She took the precious gift with both hands, so moved that she couldn't speak. She affectionately pressed the portrait of Chairman Mao to her face, reluctant to put it down for a long time.

On October 1st, on this glorious revolutionary holiday celebrated worldwide, the entire troupe happily saw the great leader Chairman Mao. When they stood on the viewing platform at Tiananmen Square and saw Chairman Mao waving to the people, they were so moved that they shed tears of joy. From morning to afternoon, for more than six hours, they didn't want to eat or drink, not wanting to leave the viewing platform for a single step, just wanting to see more of Chairman Mao. They would sing "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman" passionately one moment, and the next, they would raise the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

The Lao friends love Chairman Mao so much because they deeply understand that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader and helmsman of the Chinese people but also the great leader and helmsman of all revolutionary people worldwide. He is the one who guides all revolutionary people worldwide to victory. The dancer Mary learned to recite two poems in Chinese, which reflect the sincere feelings of all the troupe members and the Lao people's boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao: "The sun rises to shine on all four directions, Mao Zedong Thought shines with golden light. The sun warms the people, Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our hearts. The sun is red, the sun is bright, the sun's rays are endless. The great leader Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts."

    “毛主席，我们老挝人民心中的红太阳！”
    ——记老挝爱国战线党中央文工团热爱毛主席著作的动人事迹
    墙壁上张贴着一张张用老挝文写的大字报。一群老挝男女青年簇拥在大字报前面，有的席地而坐，有的倚墙站立，每人手里拿着一本红色封面的笔记本，在一字字地认真抄录。
    大字报上写的，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的语录。抄录语录的老挝青年，是来自反美斗争前线的老挝爱国战线党中央文工团的朋友们。
    毛主席著作是革命的宝书。我们一定要好好学习，做毛主席的好学生。
    从今年三月到十月上旬，老挝朋友们在中国访问演出了半年。他们踏上中国国土以后，就热切期望得到一本《毛主席语录》。当他们从中国朋友手中接过这本宝书的时候，许多人激动得热泪盈眶。有的人情不自禁地放声高歌《东方红》，有的人跳起来不断欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”演员汶翁手捧《毛主席语录》说：“毛主席著作是革命的宝书。我们一定要好好学习，做毛主席的好学生。”
    老挝朋友们拿到的是中文版《毛主席语录》，他们看不懂。这也难不住对毛主席著作无比热爱的老挝朋友。他们请中国译员把中文译成老挝文，写成大字报贴在旅馆的墙上，大家就一节节地抄起来。他们起早贪黑，夜以继日，有人常常饭也顾不得吃，有人病了还坚持抄。连十二岁的小演员麦信，也工工整整地抄了一厚本。
    在译抄《毛主席语录》的同时，老挝朋友还一次又一次地提出要求，请接待单位代买了几百本中文版、泰文版和越文版的毛主席著作单行本和《毛泽东选集》。他们随身携带毛主席的书，走到哪儿读到哪儿。坐汽车外出，他们也常常集体朗读《毛主席语录》。尽管参观演出很繁忙，他们还出了交流学习心得的墙报，写了许多学习笔记。文工团副团长占农说：“毛主席的话句句是真理，我们越读越爱读。”
    读一辈子毛主席的书，走一辈子革命的路。一辈子改造思想，一辈子为人民服务。
    老挝朋友们在学习毛主席著作的过程中，都在“用”字上下了功夫。文工团团长坎马·富贡说：“我们要用毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来，指导我们的革命行动。”
    团员陶庄学习了毛主席著作以后，思想上起了很大的变化。他激动地说：“毛主席著作使我看清了方向，懂得了做一个革命者的道理。我要把学习毛主席著作当做自己的天职，听毛主席的话，为人民服务。”
    这位青年演员的话，表达了文工团四十多位老挝朋友的共同心愿。歌唱演员维莱婉读了毛主席著作，提笔在《毛主席语录》的扉页上端端正正地写道：“读一辈子毛主席的书，走一辈子革命的路。一辈子改造思想，一辈子为人民服务。”
    一天上午，副团长巴色接见了记者。当谈到毛主席的文艺思想怎样指引着老挝爱国战线党文艺战士们的前进方向的时候，他引用了毛主席的一段话：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”巴色说，毛主席的教导，使他们明确了文艺一定要符合苦难中的劳动人民的需要，要为革命服务，要为政治服务。老挝人民正在遭受美帝国主义的野蛮侵略，他们就是要用文艺这个武器来鼓舞人民和战士的斗志，坚决打败侵略者。
    在战火中诞生的老挝爱国战线党中央文工团，对毛泽东思想感到非常亲切。许多演员都说，毛主席的话说到了他们心坎上。他们将根据毛主席的教导，和老挝的农民、战士打成一片，学习他们，了解他们，更好地为他们服务。
    即使在中国访问演出期间，老挝朋友也不放过到工农群众中去锻炼自己的机会。我国国庆前夕，朋友们来到山东省的一个农村人民公社参观。他们走到田间，看见社员们正在翻地，马上跑过去劳动开了。乐队队员林通第一个抄起铁锨干起来，他为了干活利索，把一双鞋也脱下扔在一边。老挝朋友不止一次地要求组织他们参加劳动，当中国朋友劝他们多注意身体健康的时候，他们总是说：“这是毛主席的教导，我们要向劳动人民学习。”有的演员还说：“谁不参加劳动，就不懂得为人民服务，就可能会变成修正主义！”
    老挝人民依靠战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想，一定能够赶走美帝国主义，获得真正的民族独立和解放。
    在文工团访问中国期间，记者同他们有过多次的接触。我们所访问过的许多老挝朋友都说，毛泽东思想照耀着全世界革命人民前进的道路。老挝人民依靠战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想，一定能够赶走美帝国主义，获得真正的民族独立和解放。
    演员布派、玛尼婉和维莱婉，不只一次地同中国朋友聚集在一起，朗读毛主席的这段语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”他们兴奋地告诉中国朋友说：“毛主席说出了我们心里要说的话。美帝国主义表面强大，实际虚弱，只有人民群众才是真正的铜墙铁壁。老挝人民经过长期斗争的考验，正在越战越强！”
    一位老挝朋友双手捧着毛主席的著作对记者说：“老挝人民在前进的道路上还会遇到各式各样的困难，但是，只要遵循毛主席的教导，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利，就一定能够取得最后胜利！”
    在文工团访问中国期间，他们收到了国内亲友的数十封来信，再三叮嘱他们回国时要多带回去一些毛主席著作。团员香通告诉记者，老挝爱国战线党的战士们最爱读毛主席的书。在森林中，在山洞里，在极艰苦的环境下，他们也坚持学习毛主席著作。文工团的四十多个老挝朋友，除了人手一册《毛主席语录》外，他们还把六百多本毛主席著作带回了祖国，准备送给他们的反帝战友。
    太阳红，太阳亮，太阳的光辉万万丈。伟大领袖毛主席，我们心中的红太阳。
    在每场演出中，在每次参观访问中，在同中国朋友联欢的每一个晚会上，老挝朋友们总是一遍又一遍用中国话放声歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《毛主席的书我最爱读》、《万岁，毛主席》等歌曲。他们说，这些歌我们要唱千遍万遍，来表达老挝人民无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的心情。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的像片和画像，老挝朋友们已经珍藏不少，差不多每个人都有三四张。但是，他们还把报纸上刊登的毛主席像一张一张剪下来，平平整整地放在自己箱子里，准备带回去送给亲友。他们说，老挝人民日夜想念毛主席，都想看一看毛主席。
    有一次，文工团成员占苏到新华书店去买毛主席的书，营业员送给她一张毛主席像。她双手接过珍贵的礼品，激动得一句话也说不出来。她亲切地把毛主席像贴在脸上，久久地不愿放下。
    十月一日，在这个普天同庆的光辉革命节日，文工团全体成员幸福地见到了伟大领袖毛主席。当他们站在天安门前的观礼台上看到毛主席向人们挥手致意的时候，他们激动得流下了热泪。从上午到下午的六个多小时中，他们饭也不想吃，水也不想喝，一步也不愿离开观礼台，一心只想多看看毛主席。他们一会儿纵情高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，一会儿高举红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，欢呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    老挝朋友们这样热爱毛主席，是因为他们深深地懂得，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖和舵手，也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖和舵手，是毛主席指引着全世界革命人民胜利前进的方向。舞蹈演员玛丽，学会了用中国话朗诵两首诗，这两首诗反映了文工团所有成员和老挝人民对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的真挚感情：“太阳出来照四方，毛泽东思想闪金光。太阳照得人身暖，毛泽东思想照得咱心里亮堂堂。”“太阳红，太阳亮，太阳的光辉万万丈。伟大的领袖毛主席，我们心中的红太阳。”
