Soldiers from the plateau shake off the flying snow from the Kunlun Mountains, basking in the warm sunlight of Beijing. How fortunate are the soldiers from the plateau, arriving at the Red Square of Tiananmen. Standing shoulder to shoulder with revolutionary students and teachers, they enthusiastically sing "The East Is Red." The soldiers from the plateau have longed for Chairman Mao day and night. How fortunate they are today to be by the side of the great leader. Countless red flags flutter in the wind, countless red hearts turn towards the red sun; countless copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are held high, turning the square into a red ocean. Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived! The square is swept by a wave of excitement; "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers are louder than thunder. Chairman Mao, great teacher, great leader, you are the brightest sun in the hearts of the soldiers, giving us life, giving us warmth, guiding us forward. We stand guard on the snow-capped mountains, always carrying your book with us; what do we fear in the thin air at high altitudes? Your book is an inexhaustible "Kunlun oxygen." Chairman Mao, great commander, great helmsman, you lead the revolutionary army forward. The soldiers from the plateau have seen you today, and their bodies are filled with boundless strength. Wielding the pen to sweep away all ghosts and monsters, we will be heroes in the Cultural Revolution. Wielding the gun to vigilantly watch the enemy, we are always ready to bury the invaders completely.

    高原战士来到毛主席身旁
    解放军某部  廖代谦抖落满身昆仑的飞雪，披着北京温暖的阳光，高原战士多么幸福，来到了红色的天安门广场。和革命师生紧紧站在一起，热情洋溢地把《东方红》高唱，高原战士日夜想念毛主席，多么幸福，今天来到了伟大领袖的身旁。千万面红旗迎风飞舞，千万颗红心向着红太阳；千万本《毛主席语录》高高举起，广场变成了红色的海洋。毛主席来了！毛主席来了！广场掀起了欢腾的巨浪；“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”阵阵欢呼声比春雷更响。毛主席啊，伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，您是战士心中最红的太阳，给我们生命，给我们温暖，给我们指引前进的方向。我们在雪山上站岗放哨，时刻把您的书带在身旁；万丈高山空气稀薄怕什么，您的书就是取之不竭的“昆仑氧”。毛主席啊，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手，您率领革命大军奔向前方，高原战士今天见到了您，浑身充满了无穷的力量。握紧笔杆子横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，在文化大革命中当闯将，握紧枪杆子警惕地监视敌人，时刻准备把侵略者彻底埋葬。
