Edition: 1

The 1st Squadron of a certain unit in the Air Force has, over the past decade, highly carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. With an indomitable heroism that crushes all enemies, they have successively shot down or damaged fourteen enemy aircraft, with no losses of their own, achieving a glorious record of fourteen to zero. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense conferred the honorable title of "Air Force Hero Squadron" on this squadron. The 1st Squadron's invincibility and victory in every battle are not due to steel or technology, but to politics, courage, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

"The Squadron that Thunders in the Sky"

Soon after this squadron was established, it volunteered to participate in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. At that time, each person had flown only about twenty hours on the fighter jets, and their flying skills were not high. Some pilots said, "Many American pilots participated in World War II and have flown two to three thousand hours, while we have only flown twenty to thirty hours. The difference is a hundredfold. Our wings are still soft. If we engage in combat, can we win?"

The squadron's party branch addressed this active thought by posing a question for everyone to discuss: Can our newly winged air force defeat the "air superiority" of American imperialism? Comrades who had participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation said: During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, our weapons were rifles and grenades, while the Japanese devils and Kuomintang bandits had aircraft, cannons, and tanks. We relied on our courage and fearlessness to defeat them. Now we have aircraft against aircraft. Even if our weapons are slightly inferior and our wings are a bit soft, we have red hearts and brave spirits, wholeheartedly devoted to the Party and the revolution. As long as we inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of our army's political victories, using the spirit of bayonet charges and explosive packages, we will definitely defeat the "air superiority" of American imperialism.

After the discussion, the pilots decided to engage in a showdown with the American air pirates. They brought the spirit of bayonet charges into the air battles, winning several consecutive victories. On November 28, 1952, our eight aircraft encountered eight enemy aircraft over Sariwon. The pilots, upon seeing the enemy, were all eyes red, charging into the enemy formation with the ferocity of a bayonet charge. They first overwhelmed the enemy spiritually. Seeing the situation was not favorable, the enemy aircraft panicked and scattered in all directions. Our No. 3 aircraft, Ma Qian, and No. 4 aircraft, Bi Xushai, chased after them and shot down two. After the initial victory, the pilots joyfully said: No matter how much you talk, winning battles still relies on people's courage and fearlessness. Courage can produce tactics, unity, and turn disadvantages into advantages. Only when your thoughts are firm can your wings truly be strong. Like American pilots who are cowardly and run away at the first sign of battle, no matter how good their weapons, how strong their skills, or how many tactics they learn, it won't be of any use.

Since then, whenever new pilots joined the squadron, the party branch would educate them: "Relying on the consciousness and courage of the proletariat to achieve victory in air battles," passing down this fine tradition of political victories. Multiple air battles have proven: Our army's traditional revolutionary spirit, no matter how dangerous the situation or who the enemy is, will always bloom into victory. Last March 18th's battle is another clear example.

That day, Gao Changji took off and discovered two U.S.-made RF-101 type Kuomintang aircraft. Filled with hatred, he dove down fiercely. The enemy aircraft turned around and dived to increase speed, trying to escape destruction. Gao Changji pursued relentlessly. At the beginning of the pursuit, the enemy aircraft was at an altitude of 9,000 meters, while he was at 11,000 meters. Gao Changji believed that fully utilizing human factors could make up for the speed disadvantage. High-speed aircraft diving produces a negative load, making the person weightless. Gao Changji's body floated up, his head hitting the canopy, and his body leaving the seat. The control stick could not be pushed down. However, his hatred for the enemy and his lofty ideals for communism gave him superhuman willpower and strength, fully utilizing the aircraft's performance. The distance grew closer and closer. He finally overcame numerous difficulties, pursuing to the effective firing range, pouring all his hatred into the cannon shells, and a burst of cannon fire sent the enemy aircraft crashing into the sea. The air force commander praised Gao Changji as "very brave, very calm, very tenacious, very clever, and very tough."

The greatest combat effectiveness is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death.

The hero squadron, relying on the spirit of bravery and fearlessness of death, fights with the power of thunder, unyielding and irresistible, striking fear into the enemy. Therefore, people habitually praise them as the "thunderous squadron that shakes the sky."

Political emphasis is emphasizing the masses

Fighting relies on politics, on people's courage and fearlessness of death. With this fearless spirit, the greatest wisdom is born, making them dare to struggle and struggle wisely. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, everyone in the hero squadron is fearless of death and eager to fight. To win battles, they all actively contribute ideas and methods. During the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they fought against the large formations of American imperialism; after returning home, they shifted to air defense, mainly fighting against the Kuomintang's single or small groups of reconnaissance and fighter aircraft. The situation changed, but for a period, in some battles, they still mechanically applied the tactics used against American aircraft in the Korean War. Therefore, they either did not discover the enemy aircraft or failed to open fire, and even when they did open fire, it was only a "farewell salvo" to the enemy. At that time, the cadres were so anxious that they scratched their heads, unable to come up with a good solution. A pilot who had served in the army suggested to the leadership: "In the past, when fighting in the army, whenever we encountered difficulties, we would hold a Zhuge Liang meeting, and solutions would emerge. Let's hold a Zhuge Liang meeting!"

At the first military democratic meeting, a pilot excitedly said: The objects of combat have changed, and the enemy's tactics have also changed. We are still applying rules and frameworks. Chairman Mao said in "On Protracted War": "We must try our best to blind and deafen the enemy, making them become blind and deaf, ... to achieve our victory." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we often followed this directive from Chairman Mao, frequently winning battles. Can we also make the enemy "blind and deaf" in air battles? Another pilot said: "Following the regulations to attack from a high position is correct, but it cannot be rigid. Now, to fly higher than the enemy aircraft, we are always flying at a certain altitude, and the enemy has long been prepared for this. How can we win the battle? Can we adopt flexible tactics?"

This military democratic meeting deeply educated the cadres, and everyone felt their minds had opened up. The party branch seriously adopted everyone's opinions and formulated a combat plan.

Before the National Day in 1956, they followed the enemy aircraft's activity patterns and adopted hidden methods, turning the enemy's radar into "blind" and their listening equipment into "deaf." On National Day, the enemy sent four aircraft to arrogantly intrude into our ×× region. Just as the enemy was complacent, Zhao De'an led four aircraft to secretly fly behind the enemy and suddenly attacked. Before the enemy could retaliate, they shot down and damaged one aircraft each. The pilots said: Many people mean many ideas; three cobblers can top one Zhuge Liang. In the future, if there are any ideas, speak up boldly. The cadres said: The masses are the true heroes and sages. We will definitely fully carry forward military democracy in the future. Since then, before each battle, they would tell everyone the purpose of the combat, the favorable and unfavorable conditions, and adopt a method of combining military, political, and flight personnel to express their opinions. Then, the party branch would summarize and formulate a plan. After the battle, they would conduct three evaluations: evaluate thoughts, evaluate command, and evaluate tactics. In this way, they gradually developed the tactic of changing with the enemy, changing before the enemy, and striving to outmaneuver the enemy.

Political emphasis is to emphasize the masses. To emphasize the masses, the key is whether the leadership believes in the masses and can humble themselves to discuss problems with everyone as an ordinary soldier; whether they can prioritize revolutionary interests, bravely accept the truth, bravely correct mistakes; whether they can create a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and personally comfortable, lively, and vivid. Now, the 1st Squadron has such a political situation, so the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can be fully mobilized. In air combat command and tactics, they continuously discover, invent, create, and make progress!

Courage and wisdom come from the great Mao Zedong Thought

In the hero squadron, there is a popular saying: To dare to engage in a bayonet fight with the enemy in the air, one must first engage in a bayonet fight with bourgeois thoughts in one's mind using Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades of the hero squadron place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. They study every day, apply everywhere, apply thoroughly, and apply flexibly, constantly struggling against selfish and impure thoughts, accumulating small victories into big victories, and continuously advancing on the path of ideological transformation.

Those familiar with the flight unit know that in daily flights, who flies first, who flies last, who flies which aircraft, and whether the coordination is good, etc., will all cause fluctuations in the pilots' thoughts. These issues essentially reflect the struggle between public and private, individual and collective, bourgeois and proletarian thoughts. The pilots bring these active thoughts to study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve their problems.

Once, the squadron organized a flight. As soon as pilot Sun Xiangtao landed, he boasted about the performance of his aircraft to others. At this time, the superior wanted to change his aircraft. He thought: Why change the high-performance aircraft to others? They are on the front line fighting, and I am also on the front line fighting; they need high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, and I need them too! Thinking of this, he was ready to raise objections to the squadron cadres. Should he raise them or not? He brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said in "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work": "We must oppose the tendency of localism that only cares about oneself and not others. Whoever does not care about others' difficulties, does not provide personnel when others need them, or sends bad personnel to others, 'passing the buck,' does not think about other units, other places, or other people at all, such a person is called a localist, which is a complete loss of communist spirit." He used this passage to reflect on himself again and again, unwilling to change the good aircraft to others, isn't this the thought of only caring about oneself and not others that Chairman Mao mentioned? The superior changing the good aircraft to others must be because others need it more and it is more beneficial to the battle. A communist must consider the overall situation, understand the big picture, and have a communist spirit. Thinking of this, he happily obeyed the superior's decision.

Being able to consider the whole in peacetime means being able to sacrifice oneself for the group in wartime. In one air battle, when Gao Changji was about to open fire on the enemy aircraft, he suddenly discovered that another enemy aircraft had aimed at his wingman Zhang Yilin. Should he only care about his own merits or go to aid his comrade? At this critical moment, Chairman Mao's words "selflessly serving others" flashed in his mind, and he immediately turned the aircraft to aid the wingman, turning danger into safety for Zhang Yilin.

Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." The comrades of the hero squadron, in the process of ideological transformation, closely focused on the fundamental issue of for whom to fly and for whom to fight, firmly grasping the transformation of world outlook, and firmly establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. Dong Xiaohai has been in the flight unit for about ten years, almost always as a wingman. After being transferred to the hero squadron, the leadership still let him be a wingman. He thought: Being a wingman, skills improve slowly, and there are fewer opportunities to attack in battle. He was ready to raise objections to the leadership. But he thought again, Chairman Mao said: "Wholeheartedly serving the people, never leaving the masses; everything from the people's interests, not from personal or small group interests; ... these are our starting points." He used this passage to reflect on himself, discovering that his unwillingness to be a wingman was not from the people's interests but from personal considerations, which was against Chairman Mao's teachings. Thinking of this, he bravely exposed his thoughts to all the comrades in the squadron, requesting their criticism and supervision. From then on, he actively studied how to be a good wingman, not seeking fame or personal gain in any situation, and was content to be a "hardworking ox" for the people. Last April 3rd, Dong Xiaohai shot down a U.S. military aircraft, and the superior was ready to award him. He thought: The ultimate goal of our proletarian warriors' revolution is to smash the entire old world and build a new communist world. Shooting down one or two enemy aircraft is just a drop in the ocean in the entire communist cause. Moreover, shooting down this enemy aircraft is not just my merit but the result of the Party's leadership and everyone's joint efforts. Therefore, he requested the superior not to award him personally and expressed his willingness to contribute everything to the revolution.

The comrades of the "Air Force Hero Squadron" are like this, always studying Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, fearing no difficulties and no enemies. In their defense zone, no matter if the enemy comes from high altitude, low altitude, daytime, nighttime, clear weather, or rainy weather, they will shoot without fail, winning every battle and establishing merit for the motherland and the people.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the comrades of the hero squadron have been even more ardent. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, holding a gun in one hand and a pen in the other, smashing the old world, criticizing the old world, building the new world, and defending the new world. They resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to grasp the study and application of Chairman Mao's works even more tightly, to further carry out ideological transformation, and to achieve new and greater victories in the struggle against the enemy.

### 毛泽东思想是胜利的根本——记空军某部“航空兵英雄中队”

    毛泽东思想是胜利的根本
    ——记空军某部“航空兵英雄中队”
    空军某部一中队，十几年来高度发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，用压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，先后击落击伤十四架敌机，自己无一损伤，创造了十四比零的辉煌战绩。最近，国防部授予这个中队以“航空兵英雄中队”光荣称号。一中队能够所向无敌，每战必胜，不是靠钢铁，靠技术，是靠政治，靠勇敢，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    “威震长空的霹雳中队”
    这个中队刚成立不久，就志愿参加了赴朝抗美作战。当时，每个人在战斗机上仅仅飞了二十多小时，驾驶技术水平还不高。有的飞行员说：“美国飞行员很多是参加过第二次世界大战的，飞了两三千小时，我们才飞了二三十小时，相差百倍，翅膀还软，交起手来，我们能打赢吗？”
    中队党支部针对这种活思想，就出题让大家讨论：我们刚长上翅膀的空军，能不能打败美帝国主义的“空中优势”？参加过抗日战争和解放战争的同志说：抗日战争和解放战争时期，我们的武器是步枪、手榴弹，日本鬼子和蒋匪军的武器是飞机、大炮加坦克，我们硬是靠勇敢不怕死的精神打败了它们。现在我们是飞机对飞机，即使武器差点，翅膀软点，但是我们心红胆大，一心向党，一心向革命，只要继承和发扬我军靠政治打胜仗的光荣传统，用刺刀见红、送炸药包的革命精神去干，就一定能打败美帝国主义的“空中优势”。
    经过讨论，飞行员们决心和美国空中强盗较量一番，他们把刺刀见红的精神用到了空战中去，接连打了几个胜仗。一九五二年十一月二十八日，我机八架在沙里院上空和八架敌机遭遇。飞行员们一见敌机个个眼红，以端刺刀冲锋格斗的气势，猛插到敌人机群中去，首先在精神上压倒了敌人。敌机一见形势不妙，惊慌失措，四散奔逃。我三号机马骞和四号机毕序海猛追上去，干掉两架。初战胜利，飞行员们兴高采烈地说：说一千道一万，打胜仗还是靠人的勇敢、不怕死。勇敢可以出战术，出团结，可以变劣势为优势。只有思想过得硬，翅膀才能真硬。像美国飞行员那样贪生怕死，一打仗就向后跑，武器再好，技术再强，战术学得再多也不顶用。
    以后，每来了新飞行员，中队党支部就教育他们：“靠无产阶级的觉悟和勇敢才能取得空战胜利”，把这种靠政治打胜仗的优良传统代代传下来。多次空战证明：我军这种传统的革命精神，不论在任何艰险的情况下同任何敌人作战，都会开出胜利之花。去年三月十八日那次战斗，是又一个明显的例子。
    那一天，高长吉起飞后发现两架美制RF—101型蒋机，就满怀仇恨地猛扑下去。敌机掉转机头下滑增速，企图摆脱被歼的命运。高长吉紧追不舍。开始追时，敌机高度九千米，他高度一万一千米。高长吉坚信充分发挥人的因素，可以弥补速度上的弱点。大速度飞机俯冲时产生一种负荷，使人失去重量，高长吉全身往上飘，头顶住了座舱盖，身子离开了座椅，驾驶杆往下推推不动。可是对敌人的仇恨和对共产主义的崇高理想，使他产生了超人的意志和力量，飞机性能得到充分的发挥，距离越追越近。他终于克服了重重困难，追赶到有效射击距离，把仇恨全部倾注在炮弹上，一串炮弹把敌机打得立即掉到大海里去了。空军首长称赞高长吉“十分勇敢，十分沉着，十分顽强，十分机智，十分过硬”。
    最大的战斗力，就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢不怕死。
    英雄中队就凭着勇敢不怕死的精神，打起仗来威力就好像霹雳，一往无前，势不可当，敌人闻风丧胆。因此，人们习惯地赞扬他们为“威震长空的霹雳中队”。
    突出政治就是突出群众
    打仗靠政治，靠人的勇敢、不怕死。有了这种大无畏的精神，就有了最大的智慧，使他们在敢于斗争的基础上，群策群力，善于斗争。英雄中队在毛泽东思想的哺育下，人人不怕死，人人想打仗，他们为了打胜仗，都积极地出主意，想办法。在赴朝抗美作战时，他们打的是美帝国主义的大机群；回国后转入国土防空，主要打的是蒋匪帮单批单架侦察机和小股窜犯的战斗机。情况变了，但是开始一个时期，在有些战斗中，他们还机械运用朝鲜战场上和美机作战的打法。所以不是发现不了敌机，就是捞不到开炮，即使开了炮，也是对敌人打的“欢送炮”。当时把干部们急的抓耳挠腮，一时也想不出好办法来。在陆军当过兵的飞行员就向领导提议说：“过去在陆军打仗，一遇到困难，就开诸葛亮会，开了就有好办法，还是开个诸葛亮会吧！”
    在第一次军事民主大会上，一个飞行员激动地说：作战的对象变了，敌人的战术也变了，我们还是搬条条，套框框。毛主席在《论持久战》中早就说过：“我们要把敌人的眼睛和耳朵尽可能地封住，使他们变成瞎子和聋子，……用以争取自己的胜利。”抗日战争时期，我们经常按毛主席这一指示去做，经常打胜仗。在空战中，我们是不是也可以使敌人“变成瞎子和聋子”呢？另外一个飞行员说：“按照条令居高临下地打是对的，但是不能一成不变。现在，我们为了比敌机飞得高，老是在某个高度上飞，敌人早就作了防备。这样，怎么能打胜仗呢？是不是可以采取机动灵活的打法？”这次军事民主大会，使干部们受到了深刻教育，大家都感到脑子开了窍。党支部认真采纳了大家的意见，制成作战方案。
    一九五六年国庆节前，他们根据敌机活动的规律，采用了隐蔽的办法，把敌人的雷达变成了“瞎子”，把敌人的侦听设备变成了“聋子”。国庆节那天，敌人派了四架飞机大摇大摆地窜到我××地区上空。正在敌人洋洋得意的时候，赵德安率领着四架飞机十分隐蔽地飞到敌机后面，突然向敌机进行攻击。敌机还没有来得及还手，就被他们击落击伤各一架。飞行员们说：人多就是主意多，三个臭皮匠就是能顶一个诸葛亮，以后有啥想法就大胆提。干部们说：群众才是真正的英雄，才是真正的圣人，我们今后一定要充分发扬军事民主。以后，每次战斗前，他们都把作战的目的、有利条件和不利条件告诉大家，采取军事干部、政治干部、飞行员三结合的办法，各抒己见，然后由党支部再集中起来制定方案。打完仗后，进行三评：评思想，评指挥，评战术。这样，逐步开展了敌变我变、我先变于敌，争取比敌人高一招的战术研究活动。
    突出政治就是要突出群众。要突出群众，关键在于领导相信不相信群众，能不能放下架子，以普通一兵的身份和大家研究问题；能不能以革命利益为重，勇于接受真理，勇于改正错误；能不能创造出又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅，生动活泼那样一种政治局面。现在，一中队就有这样的政治局面，因而，群众的积极性和创造性就能充分地调动起来，在空战指挥和作战战术方面，他们就不断地有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进！
    勇敢和智慧来源于伟大的毛泽东思想
    在英雄中队里，流行着这样一句话：要敢于在空中和敌人拚刺刀，首先要用毛泽东思想和自己头脑里的资产阶级思想拚刺刀。英雄中队的同志们把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。他们天天读，处处用，用得狠，用得活，一点一滴地和私心杂念作斗争，积小胜为大胜，在思想革命化的大道上不断前进。
    熟悉飞行部队的人都知道，在平时飞行中，谁先飞，谁后飞，谁飞那架飞机，协同的好不好，等等，都会引起飞行员的思想波动。这些问题实质上都是公和私、个人和集体、资产阶级和无产阶级两种思想斗争的反映。飞行员们带着这些活思想学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想回答和解决自己的问题。
    有一次，中队组织飞行。飞行员孙湘涛一落地，就向别人夸耀自己的飞机性能好。正在这时，上级要调换他的飞机。他想：为什么要把性能好的飞机调给别人？他们在前线打仗，我也是在前线打仗；他们需要速度大爬高快的飞机，我也需要啊！想到这里，他就准备向中队干部提意见。该不该提呢？他带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席在《整顿党的作风》一文里说：“必须反对只顾自己不顾别人的本位主义的倾向。谁要是对别人的困难不管，别人要调他所属的干部不给，或以坏的送人，‘以邻为壑’，全不为别部、别地、别人想一想，这样的人就叫做本位主义者，这就是完全失掉了共产主义的精神。”他用这段话对照自己想了又想，不愿意把好飞机调给别人，这不正是毛主席说的只顾自己不顾别人的思想吗？上级把好飞机调给别人，一定是别人比自己更需要，对作战更有利。一个共产党员要顾大局，识大体，要有共产主义精神。想到这里，他就愉快地服从了上级的决定。
    平时能够处处为整体着想，战时就能够舍己为群。高长吉在一次空战中，当他瞄准了敌机刚要开炮时，突然发现另一架敌机已经瞄准了自己的僚机张以林。是只顾自己立战功呢，还是去援助战友？在这紧急关头，毛主席的“毫不利己专门利人”的话在自己的脑子里闪现出来，他毫不迟疑地猛转机头去援救僚机，使张以林同志转危为安。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。英雄中队的同志们在思想革命化过程中，紧紧围绕着为谁飞行、为谁打仗这个根本问题，狠抓世界观的改造，牢固树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。董小海到飞行部队十来年，几乎都是当僚机。他调到英雄中队后，领导上还是让他当僚机。他想：当僚机，技术提高的慢，打仗时攻击的机会少，准备向领导上提意见。但他又一想，毛主席说：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；……这些就是我们的出发点。”他拿这段话对照检查自己，发现自己不想当僚机，不是从人民利益出发，而是从个人考虑出发，这是违背毛主席的教导的。想到这里，他大胆地在全中队同志面前暴露自己的思想，请求同志们批评、监督。从这以后，他积极钻研怎样当好僚机，任何情况下不为名不为利，安心做一个人民的“老黄牛”。去年四月三日，董小海打掉了一架美国军用飞机，上级准备给他立功授奖。他想：我们无产阶级战士革命的最终目的，是要打破整个旧世界，建立一个共产主义的新世界。击落一两架敌机，在整个共产主义事业中，不过是大海之一滴。再说，打下这一架敌机，也不是我一个人的功劳，而是党的领导和大家共同努力的结果。于是，他请求上级不要给他个人立功，并表示要为革命贡献自己的一切。
    “航空兵英雄中队”的同志们就是这样，时时刻刻读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，什么困难都不怕，什么敌人都不在话下。在他们的防区里，不管敌人是高空来，低空来，白昼来，黑夜来，晴天来，雨天来，都照打不误，每战必胜，为祖国人民建立了功勋。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，英雄中队的同志们更加斗志昂扬。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，一手拿枪，一手拿笔，打碎旧世界，批判旧世界，建设新世界，保卫新世界。他们坚决响应林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的号召，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加抓紧活学活用毛主席著作，进一步搞好思想革命化，夺取对敌斗争新的更大的胜利。

    英雄中队的飞行员无限忠于毛泽东思想。他们每次练兵前都要认真学习毛主席有关帝国主义本性不会改变的论述，带着对美帝国主义的强烈的阶级仇恨去练兵。
