In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wuhan has seen the emergence of over 3,000 "Ulanhu Chi" style Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Tens of thousands of propagandists have taken to the streets, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao, actively spreading Mao Zedong Thought, deeply propagating the Sixteen Points, creating a grand and unprecedented spectacle, and receiving the warm welcome and support of the broad masses.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams were born in the midst of the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are primarily composed of Red Guards, with participants including revolutionary teachers and students from various levels of schools, revolutionary workers from industrial, transportation, financial, commercial, and health systems, rural farmers from the suburbs, revolutionary cadres, and active members of residents' committees and Young Pioneers, as well as performers and staff from professional art troupes. With boundless loyalty and love for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, they are filled with high revolutionary enthusiasm and are active on the front lines of the struggle. Since late August, these propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought have been continuously appearing on the streets. Revolutionary songs, revolutionary slogans, and leaflets can be seen everywhere in Wuhan, effectively supporting the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams are not only propaganda teams but also study teams. Each team places the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront, leading the way in learning, actively applying what they learn, and actively propagating. They strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. Some Red Guards from schools, when their propaganda teams were first established, were concerned about not being able to sing or dance well and feared that the propaganda might not be effective. They studied "Three Articles" and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and other articles, which strengthened their resolve. They said: With a heart that loves Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and with efforts to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, one can become a red propagandist. Many people regard participating in the activities of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams as attending a training class to study Chairman Mao's works. Each propaganda activity is, in fact, a lively session of studying and sharing Chairman Mao's works.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams are the "Ulanhu Chi" of the cities. They carry forward the fine traditions of revolutionary propaganda teams and battlefield cultural troupes, breaking away from all old frameworks, creating and performing their own shows, and adopting forms that the masses love to see. They go deep into the streets and alleys to propagate among the people. The propagandists, with deep class feelings, timely create and perform a large number of programs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, praising the Sixteen Points, and praising the Red Guards, which are deeply loved by the masses.

Wherever the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams go, the revolutionary masses welcome them warmly. Some masses even visit them at home or write letters inviting the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to their places for propaganda. To meet the demands of the masses, the propaganda teams do not set any conditions, do not fear the distance, do not fear fatigue, and fight continuously, sometimes performing in more than ten places from morning to night. Some Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams went to the suburban people's communes, where the team members labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants and performed in the fields, earning the praise of the poor and lower-middle peasants: The propaganda teams have brought us Mao Zedong Thought and the spirit of proletarian revolution.

    热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席　广泛传播毛泽东思想
    武汉涌现三千多“乌兰牧骑”式宣传队
    十几万人的宣传大军活跃在大街小巷和郊区公社受到群众的热烈欢迎
    据新华社武汉十三日电　在无产阶级文化大革命中，武汉地区出现了三千多个“乌兰牧骑”式的毛泽东思想宣传队。十几万人的宣传大军，走上街头，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，积极宣传毛泽东思想，深入宣传十六条，声势浩大，盛况空前，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎和支持。
    毛泽东思想宣传队是在波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命运动中诞生的，是以红卫兵为主体组织起来的，参加的有各大中小学校的革命师生，有工交、财贸、卫生系统的革命职工，有郊区农民，有革命干部，还有居民委员会的积极分子和少先队员，也有专业文艺团体的演员职员。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限忠诚、无限热爱的感情，以高度的革命激情，活跃在斗争前线。从八月下旬以来，这些传播毛泽东思想的宣传大军，川流不息地出现在街头巷尾。武汉市到处是革命的歌声，到处是革命的标语和传单，有力地配合了无产阶级文化大革命的斗争。
    毛泽东思想宣传队，既是宣传队，又是学习队。各个宣传队都把学习毛主席著作放在首位，带头学习，活学活用，活宣传，坚持做到努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想。有的学校红卫兵组成的宣传队刚建立时，有的人耽心不会唱、不会跳，搞不好宣传。他们就学习“老三篇”和《中国社会各阶级的分析》等文章，坚定了信心。他们说：有了一颗热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想的红心，努力用毛泽东思想武装头脑，就能够做个红色的宣传员。许多人把参加毛泽东思想宣传队的活动看做是进了一次学习毛主席著作训练班。而每一次的宣传活动，实际上也是一次生动的学习毛主席著作讲用会。
    毛泽东思想宣传队，是城市的“乌兰牧骑”，他们发扬了革命宣传队、战地文工团的优良传统，打破了一切旧框框，自编自唱自讲，采取群众喜闻乐见的形式，深入大街小巷，向群众宣传。宣传队员们怀着深厚的阶级感情，及时编写和演出了大量的歌颂伟大领袖毛主席、歌颂十六条、赞扬红卫兵的节目，深受群众欢迎。
    毛泽东思想宣传队走到那里，那里的革命群众就热情地接待他们。有的群众还登门拜访或写信热情邀请毛泽东思想宣传队到他们那里去宣传。宣传队为了满足群众要求，不讲条件，不怕路远，不怕疲劳，连续作战，有时从早到晚到十几个地方进行演出。有些毛泽东思想宣传队到了市郊人民公社，队员们和贫下中农同劳动，在田头地边演出，贫下中农反映：宣传队给我们送来了毛泽东思想，送来了无产阶级革命精神。
