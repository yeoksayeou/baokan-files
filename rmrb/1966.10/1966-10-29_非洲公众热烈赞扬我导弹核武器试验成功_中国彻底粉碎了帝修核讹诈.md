The news of China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test reached the exhibition of pictures from Dazhai People's Commune and Dazhai Production Brigade held in Bamako, the capital of Mali, and was warmly welcomed by people from various sectors of Mali. Hundreds of viewers applauded enthusiastically several times and shook hands warmly with Chinese staff to express their congratulations.

A Malian student wrote in the guest book: "I am very happy to learn about China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test. I congratulate all the people of China who are advancing bravely under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. People of all countries in the world, especially those in Asia and Africa, feel infinite excitement upon hearing this important news, feeling themselves becoming stronger and stronger. Reactionaries of all countries, especially American imperialists and modern revisionists, are trembling like leaves upon hearing this news. In fact, as Chairman Mao said, they are all paper tigers.

"Down with the reactionaries!
"Long live the revolution!
"Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

A Malian worker said, after China's three nuclear explosions, it has achieved another great victory. The people of Africa are very happy. For the people of Mali, this is a great encouragement; for the imperialists, this is a heavy blow.

A Malian worker named Yusuf said, now the imperialists can no longer use nuclear blackmail against the oppressed people. Mali highly values China's great achievements, which are weapons of peace.

A teacher said, China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test has completely shattered the nuclear blackmail of imperialists and revisionists. China's nuclear weapons belong to the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 28 - The acting chairman of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), Leballo, issued a statement here on the evening of the 27th, welcoming and congratulating China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test. The statement pointed out that this great achievement of China is "the direct result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China and the powerful and correct application of Mao Zedong Thought."

The statement said, this great achievement of China has forever shattered the slanders of American imperialists and revisionists that the people of China are backward in nuclear science, ended the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union, and is a guarantee against nuclear blackmail. It is a great contribution to the defense of true peace and a timely response to the Manila Conference directed by the United States. The statement said, this achievement of China is a great encouragement to the revolutionary struggles currently unfolding in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and is a great support to the people of colonial countries.

The statement said: "The great achievements of the People's Republic of China will definitely inspire and encourage the oppressed and exploited people of Azania, helping them in their revolutionary struggle on the African continent."
