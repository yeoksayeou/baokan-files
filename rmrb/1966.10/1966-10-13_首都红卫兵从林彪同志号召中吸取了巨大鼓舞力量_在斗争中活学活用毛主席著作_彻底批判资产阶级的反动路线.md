Capital Red Guards Draw Great Inspiration from Comrade Lin Biao's Call

In the Struggle, Actively Learn and Apply Chairman Mao's Works to Thoroughly Criticize the Bourgeois Reactionary Line

Xinhua News Agency, October 12th - Comrade Lin Biao's recent call to elevate the mass movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage has greatly inspired and encouraged the revolutionary Red Guards in the capital who are currently criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. They say, "We Red Guards are the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the People's Liberation Army are also instructions to us. The Red Guards unanimously declare that they will definitely regard Mao Zedong Thought as their first lifeline, truly achieve active learning and application in the struggle, resolutely defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

After hearing the broadcast and reading the newspapers, the revolutionary Red Guards in the capital's colleges and universities were extremely excited and elated. Many immediately copied Comrade Lin Biao's call word for word onto big-character posters in bright red ink and held discussions. Many revolutionary Red Guards at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics organized study sessions and discussions through the night. They said, "At this critical moment in the deepening of the Cultural Revolution, Comrade Lin Biao issued this directive, like a timely rain, every word and sentence fell into our hearts, adding boundless wisdom and strength, and pointing out the direction for us to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must seriously understand the spirit of Comrade Lin Biao's call and definitely master Mao Zedong Thought, applying it in actual struggles. Only in this way can we become good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

After studying Comrade Lin Biao's directive, many revolutionary Red Guards at Tsinghua University excitedly said: "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We can see clearly in the complex struggles and persist in the struggles without wavering in difficult times, all thanks to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We deeply feel that whoever holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought can grasp the general direction of class struggle and be invincible. They declared that they would definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, push the movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high level, open up a new situation, and forever be Red Guards loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionary Red Guards at Beijing Normal University held a discussion on the topic of 'How to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.' They said, "The key to whether one learns well or not is whether one truly acts according to Chairman Mao's teachings. We must repeatedly learn and apply in the midst of class struggle storms to root Mao Zedong Thought deeply in our minds and truly make it our soul."

During the study of Comrade Lin Biao's directive, many revolutionary Red Guards from institutions such as Renmin University of China, Beijing Institute of Geology, and Peking University reviewed the struggles of the previous stage. They deeply felt that the younger generation needs to strive to learn the "Three Articles" and take the "Three Articles" as their motto. While transforming the objective world, they must vigorously transform the subjective world, take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest action guideline, emphasize implementation, and work hard on application to quickly launch a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They will use Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful ideological weapon, to identify, criticize, and command everything, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, overthrow all ghosts and monsters, and achieve greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Many Red Guard organizations in colleges and universities have also made decisions to implement Comrade Lin Biao's call, making it an unshakable rule to read and apply daily. They are determined to truly build the Red Guards into a combat team, study team, and propaganda team that is extremely proletarianized and revolutionary, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

    首都红卫兵从林彪同志号召中吸取了巨大鼓舞力量
    在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作  彻底批判资产阶级的反动路线
    新华社十二日讯　林彪同志最近向人民解放军发出的把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动提高到一个新阶段的号召，给首都正在批判资产阶级反动路线的广大革命的红卫兵小将带来了极大的鼓舞和力量。他们说，我们红卫兵是人民解放军的后备军，林彪同志对人民解放军的指示，就是对我们的指示。红卫兵们一致表示，一定要把毛泽东思想当作自己的第一生命，在斗争中真正做到活学活用，坚决捍卫和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    首都大专院校的红卫兵小将们听到广播和读到报纸以后，万分振奋，欢欣鼓舞。许多人立刻把林彪同志的号召逐字逐句地抄写在鲜红的大字报上，并且纷纷举行座谈。北京航空学院许多革命的红卫兵连夜组织学习和讨论。他们说，林彪同志在文化大革命深入发展的关键时刻，发出这个指示，像“及时雨”一样，字字句句落到我们的心坎上，给我们增添了无限的智慧和力量，指明了我们活学活用毛主席著作的方向。我们一定要认真领会林彪同志号召的精神，一定把毛泽东思想真正学到手，在实际斗争中用，只有这样，才能当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    清华大学许多革命的红卫兵小将学习了林彪同志的指示以后，激动地说：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我们能在复杂的斗争中心明眼亮，在困难的时候能坚持斗争，毫不动摇，就是靠的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们深深体会到，谁把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高，谁就能掌握阶级斗争的大方向，谁就能无往而不胜。他们表示，一定要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作运动推向新高潮，提到新水平，打开新局面，永远做忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的红卫兵。北京师范大学许多革命的红卫兵，以“怎样才能把毛泽东思想学到手”为题进行了座谈。他们说，学得好不好，最关键的一条，看你是不是真正的照毛主席教导去做。我们必须在阶级斗争的大风大浪中反复学，反复用，才能使毛泽东思想在自己的脑子里扎下根，真正化为自己的灵魂。
    中国人民大学、北京地质学院、北京大学等大专院校的许多革命的红卫兵，在学习林彪同志指示时，回顾了前一阶段的斗争。他们深深感到，青年一代更需要努力学习“老三篇”，以“老三篇”作为座右铭，在改造客观世界的同时，狠狠地改造主观世界，把毛泽东思想作为最高的行动纲领，要讲究落实，在用字上狠下功夫，迅速掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，用毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器去识别一切，批判一切，统帅一切，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更大胜利。
    许多大专院校的红卫兵组织还作出了贯彻执行林彪同志号召的决定，把天天读，天天用定为雷打不动的制度，决心把红卫兵真正建设成为活学活用毛泽东思想的非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的战斗队、学习队和宣传队。
