The spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on October 11, strongly protesting the savage crimes of the U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of the Vietnamese demilitarized zone and sternly exposing the clumsy tricks played by the American aggressors in their so-called "cessation" of bombing the eastern part of the demilitarized zone.

Recently, the American aggressors have been wantonly bombing the Vietnamese demilitarized zone. Just a few days ago, they suddenly announced a "cessation" of bombing the eastern part of the demilitarized zone. This is part of the "bombing halt and enticement" grand deception being orchestrated by the Johnson administration. In recent days, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, along with their various lackeys, have been busily promoting this deception. The American aggressors are now putting on a show of "halting" bombing in the eastern part of the demilitarized zone to carry out their "bombing halt and enticement" deception. This trick is transparent to all.

At the same time that the White House announced the "cessation" of bombing the eastern part of the demilitarized zone, Western newspapers revealed that U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara went to Saigon to plot military schemes for the U.S. aggressors to invade the demilitarized zone and launch an amphibious assault on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On October 10, the U.S. military headquarters in Vietnam formally announced the deployment of two Marine Corps divisions to the vicinity of the demilitarized zone. Look, the so-called "cessation" of bombing in the eastern part of the demilitarized zone—isn't this just a cover for the U.S. imperialists' further war adventures?

The American aggressors even openly declared that they would impose a "blockade" on the demilitarized zone. Their "cessation" of bombing the eastern part of the demilitarized zone is also to use the International Control Commission to help achieve this plot. The American aggressors have completely torn up the Geneva Agreement, even openly bombing the demilitarized zone, so what right do they have to talk about inspections by the International Control Commission? The American bandits' imposition of a military "blockade" on the demilitarized zone and their use of the International Control Commission for so-called "inspections" are all acts of aggression against the Vietnamese people and will be severely condemned by the Vietnamese people and people all over the world.

The heroic Vietnamese people have already declared to the world that as long as the U.S. aggressors do not completely withdraw from the sacred territory of Vietnam, they will fight to the end until they achieve final victory. The "bombing halt and enticement" deception being carried out by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices is doomed to fail.

    美国侵略者的拙劣花招本报评论员
    越南民主共和国外交部发言人十月十一日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义接连轰炸越南非军事区的野蛮罪行，并且严正地揭穿了美国侵略者玩弄所谓“停止”轰炸非军事区东部地区的拙劣花招。
    前些时候，美国侵略强盗滥肆轰炸越南非军事区，最近几天忽然宣布“停止”轰炸非军事区东部地区。这是约翰逊政府正在策动的“停炸诱和”大骗局的一个组成部分。这些天来，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，及其形形色色的走卒们，都在紧张地为这个骗局奔忙。美国侵略者现在作出一个在非军事区东部地区“停炸”的姿态，来推行它的“停炸诱和”的骗局。这种鬼把戏，是一眼就可以看穿的。
    就在白宫宣布“停止”轰炸非军事区东部地区的同时，据西方报刊透露，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉到西贡，就是去策划美国侵略军进攻非军事区和通过“两栖登陆”侵入越南民主共和国的军事阴谋。十月十日，侵越美军总部正式宣布，把两师海军陆战队调往非军事区附近。请看，所谓在非军事区东部地区的“停炸”，难道不是为了替美帝国主义进一步扩大战争冒险的阴谋打掩护吗？
    美国侵略者竟然公开宣称，要对非军事区实行“封锁”。它对非军事区东部地区的“停炸”，也是为了利用国际委员会来帮助它实现这个阴谋。美国侵略者已经彻底撕毁了日内瓦协议，甚至公然对非军事区进行了轰炸，还有什么资格谈论国际委员会的视察呢？美国强盗对非军事区实行什么军事“封锁”和利用国际委员会进行所谓“视察”，都是对越南人民的侵略罪行，都将受到越南人民和全世界人民的严厉谴责。
    英雄的越南人民早已向全世界宣告，美国侵略军不全部撤出越南的神圣国土，他们就一定要战斗到底，直到取得最后的胜利。美帝国主义及其帮凶所推行的“停炸诱和”骗局，是注定要失败的。
