A new acrylonitrile plant in China has recently been completed and has started production.

Acrylonitrile is a crucial intermediate in the production of new synthetic materials. Through polymerization, it can be used to manufacture fibers that are excellent for clothing and yarn, offering good insulation, high elasticity, softness, lightness, and durability, and are resistant to mildew. Acrylonitrile can also be copolymerized with other chemical raw materials to produce high-performance synthetic rubber and plastics, which have wide applications in industrial, agricultural production, and national defense construction.

The newly built acrylonitrile plant was entirely designed and constructed by China, using equipment manufactured domestically.

    我国新建丙烯腈车间投产
    我国一个新的丙烯腈车间，最近已经建成并投入了生产。
    丙烯腈是新型合成材料的重要中间体。它经过聚合，可以制造一种保暖性好，弹性高，柔软、轻盈、结实，还不霉蛀，用做衣料和毛线的好纤维。丙烯腈还可以和其他化工原料共聚，制成性能优异的合成橡胶和塑料，在工、农业生产和国防建设上有着广泛的用途。
    新建成的这个丙烯腈车间，完全是我国自己设计，自己施工，采用的设备也是我国自己制造的。
