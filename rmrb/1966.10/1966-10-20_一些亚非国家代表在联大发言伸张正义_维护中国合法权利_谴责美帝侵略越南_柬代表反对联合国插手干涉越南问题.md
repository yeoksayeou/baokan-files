Some Asian and African countries' representatives at the UNGA spoke to uphold justice, defend China's legitimate rights, condemn U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and the Cambodian representative opposed UN interference in Vietnam.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 19th, New York: On the 17th, Cambodia's representative to the United Nations, Hou Senba, spoke during the UN General Assembly's general debate. He strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, exposed the U.S.'s "peace talks" tricks, and demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from South Vietnam. He also pointed out that the UN has no right to interfere in Vietnam's affairs.

Hou Senba in his speech also refuted U.S. imperialism's slanders against China. He demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

Hou Senba, when discussing the Vietnam issue, pointed out: "The only ones causing the Vietnamese people's suffering are the American imperialists." He said: "Washington's excuses can no longer make us forget the brutal military actions the U.S. is currently conducting in Vietnam."

He expressed support for the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and pointed out that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the true representative of the South Vietnamese people.

He opposed the UN's interference in Vietnam's affairs and pointed out: The UN General Assembly's "sole responsibility" is to condemn U.S. aggression and demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam.

Hou Senba also strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's support and instigation of the South Vietnamese puppet regime and the Thai reactionary government's repeated invasions of Cambodian territory.

Hou Senba in his speech reaffirmed that the Royal Government of Cambodia advocates for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and pointed out that the U.S. should return Taiwan, which it controls through the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to China. In praising China's peaceful policies, he refuted the U.S.'s slanders against China.

After approximately one month of general debate at the UNGA, it concluded on the 18th. During the debate, U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression against Vietnam and hostility towards China were repeatedly condemned by some Asian and African countries.

On the 14th, Mali's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ousmane Ba, in his speech strongly demanded that the U.S. stop its aggression against Vietnam. He said that the bombing of North Vietnam must stop, foreign troops in South Vietnam must withdraw, and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam must be recognized as the sole representative of the South Vietnamese people.

Ousmane Ba also emphasized that the United Nations is paralyzed because "someone is exerting pressure, plotting conspiracies, and engaging in blackmail to obstruct the restoration of the rights of a country whose people make up a quarter of the world's population." He demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and pointed out, "The Chinese people are an indivisible whole, the true government of the Chinese people is in Beijing, and insisting on giving the representative rights of the Chinese people to the Chiang Kai-shek regime is an affront to justice, something our organization can no longer tolerate."

On the same day, Congo (Brazzaville)'s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ganao, clearly pointed out: "There is aggression in Vietnam. The aggressor is U.S. imperialism, and the victim is the Vietnamese people." He said that the brutal crimes of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam "make it difficult for us to find any difference between the U.S. government and Hitler's Germany." He also demanded the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations and the expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's "representatives" from the UN organization.

Romania's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Manescu, in his speech on the 14th also condemned U.S. aggression against Vietnam and expressed "a firm demand for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and other international organizations." Before this, representatives from Pakistan, Nepal, Guinea, and other countries also strongly expressed their support for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

    一些亚非国家代表在联大发言伸张正义
    维护中国合法权利　谴责美帝侵略越南
    柬代表反对联合国插手干涉越南问题
    据新华社十九日讯  纽约消息：柬埔寨驻联合国代表胡森巴十七日在联合国大会一般性辩论中发言，强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南的侵略罪行，揭露美国的“和谈”花招；他要求美国军队撤出越南南方，指出联合国无权过问越南问题。
    胡森巴在发言中还驳斥了美帝国主义对中国的诬蔑。他要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    胡森巴在谈到越南问题时指出：“唯一造成越南人民苦难的是美帝国主义者。”他说：“华盛顿提出的辩解不再能使我们忘记（美国）目前正在越南进行的残暴的军事行动”。
    他表示支持越南人民争取民族独立的正义斗争，并且指出，越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的真正代表。
    他表示反对联合国插手越南问题，并且指出：联合国大会的“唯一责任”，是谴责美国的侵略和要求美军撤出南越。
    胡森巴还强烈谴责美帝国主义支持和怂恿南越傀儡政权和泰国反动当局不断侵犯柬埔寨的领土。
    胡森巴在发言中重申，柬埔寨王国政府主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，并指出，美国应把它通过蒋介石集团统治的台湾归还给中国。他在赞扬中国的和平政策时，驳斥了美国对中国的诬蔑。
    联大一般性辩论进行了约一个月之后，已经在十八日结束。在辩论中，美帝国主义侵略越南和敌视中国的政策，不断遭到一些亚非国家的谴责。
    马里外交部长乌斯曼·巴在十四日的发言中强烈要求美国停止对越南的侵略。他说，对越南北方的轰炸必须停止，在南越的外国军队必须撤走，必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一代表。
    乌斯曼·巴还强调指出，联合国处于瘫痪状态，因为“有人施加压力、策划阴谋和进行讹诈，来阻挠恢复占全世界人口四分之一的一个国家的人民的权利”。他要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，并指出，“中国人民是不可分割的一个整体，中国人民真正的政府在北京，硬要把代表中国人民的代表权交给蒋介石当局，就是无视正义，这是我们这个组织再也不能容忍的事。”
    同一天，刚果（布）外交部长加纳奥在发言中明确指出：“在越南存在侵略。侵略者是美帝国主义，受害者是越南人民。”他说，美帝国主义在越南的残酷罪行“使我们难以找到美国政府和希特勒德国之间有丝毫的差别。”他也要求恢复中国在联合国的合法席位，把蒋介石的“代表”驱逐出联合国组织。
    罗马尼亚外交部长曼内斯库在十四日的发言中，也谴责美国对越南的侵略，并表示“坚决要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国以及其它国际组织中的合法权利。”在这以前，巴基斯坦、尼泊尔、几内亚等国代表在发言中，也都强烈表示支持恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。
