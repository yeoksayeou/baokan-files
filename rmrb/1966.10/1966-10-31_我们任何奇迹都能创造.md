Upon hearing the news of our country's successful test launch of a missile carrying a nuclear weapon, I felt immense excitement and joy. I shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

The successful test launch of a missile carrying a nuclear weapon is a major achievement for the Chinese people in further strengthening national defense, safeguarding national security, and promoting world peace. It is a severe blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. It solemnly declares to the world that the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism have completely failed! Their evil attempts to blockade and sabotage our people's acquisition of nuclear weapons have been thoroughly smashed! We possess the spiritual atomic bomb that our enemies do not have, and now we also have the material atomic bomb. We will definitely defeat any invader!

The successful test launch of a missile carrying a nuclear weapon is a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a victory of the Chinese people's spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress. Chairman Mao said: "People's social existence determines their thoughts. Once the correct thoughts representing the advanced class are grasped by the masses, they will become a material force to transform society and the world." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people, with deep proletarian revolutionary feelings, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, and dare to scale peaks that no one has reached. This successful test launch of a missile carrying a nuclear weapon fully proves that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, will generate tremendous material force, and any miracle in the world can be created. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to most resolutely, actively, and enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the soul and promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, to better build socialism, and to support the world revolution!

    我们任何奇迹都能创造
    全国人民代表大会代表  国际主义战士罗盛教的父亲  罗迭开
    听到我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的大喜事，我感到无比的激动，无比的高兴。我一千次一万次地高呼：毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
    发射导弹核武器试验成功是我国人民进一步加强国防力量，保卫祖国安全和世界和平所取得的新的重大成就，是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的一个严重的打击，它庄严地向全世界宣告：美帝国主义、现代修正主义的核垄断、核讹诈彻底破产了！他们封锁和破坏我国人民掌握核武器的罪恶企图，被我们彻底粉碎了！我们拥有敌人不可能有的精神原子弹，也有了物质原子弹，我们一定能战胜任何侵略者！
    发射导弹核武器试验成功，是毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果，是我国人民发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神的胜利。毛主席说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”我国人民在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，带着深厚的无产阶级革命感情，活学活用毛主席著作，大力促进了人的思想革命化，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。这次发射导弹核武器试验成功，充分地证明了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，一旦为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量，任何人间奇迹都能创造出来。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，最坚决最积极最热烈地响应林彪同志的伟大号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，用毛泽东思想改造灵魂，促进人的思想革命化，更好地建设社会主义，支援世界革命！　（新华社讯）
