Our great leader Chairman Mao has called on us to learn from Comrade Zhang Thide, Comrade Norman Bethune, and Comrade Lei Feng. They are all people with a lofty communist spirit. They have no selfish motives, seek neither fame nor wealth, fear neither hardship nor death, and serve the people wholeheartedly. They live and fight for the revolution, and die for the revolution. They are selfless communist warriors.

Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, in our army and our country, tens of thousands and millions of selfless communist warriors are growing and emerging. Comrade Cai Yongxiang is another shining example.

When a train full of Red Guards suddenly faced danger, Comrade Cai Yongxiang stepped forward, removed the obstacles placed on the tracks by the cunning class enemies, and sacrificed his precious life to ensure the safety of thousands of class brothers on the train. His selfless communist spirit will forever live in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, becoming a force that inspires, motivates, and drives people forward.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a new stage in the deepening of the socialist revolution. It is a new stage in the deepening of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. This great revolution aims to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, develop the socialist system, and uproot the roots of capitalism and revisionism. This inevitably encounters the frenzied resistance of the enemies of the proletariat and the people.

However, in the face of the revolutionary people armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how cunning the class enemies are, their sabotage and disruption will not succeed. Comrade Cai Yongxiang remained highly vigilant against the class enemies. With his brave and decisive actions, he foiled the enemy's plot and made a contribution to safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang once said: In this life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, I will dedicate everything to the Party and the people! In the critical moment, he faithfully fulfilled this vow. He is truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao and a loyal defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. His heroic deeds fully embody the boundless loyalty of our military personnel to Chairman Mao, their deep love for the Red Guards, and their sense of responsibility to safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang's life was completely and thoroughly dedicated to the people. His comrades-in-arms said: "Comrade Cai Yongxiang's mind was filled with comrades and others, but there was no room for himself." To complete the great cause of socialist revolution and construction, and to gradually transition to communism, we need to cultivate tens of thousands and millions of such selfless new communist people. Such people are the noble, pure, moral, and disinterested people who are beneficial to the people, as Chairman Mao said.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang loved Chairman Mao the most, read Chairman Mao's books the most, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions the most, propagated Mao Zedong Thought the most, learned from heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought the most, and hated those who opposed Mao Zedong Thought the most. He studied Chairman Mao's works the most, focusing on the "Three Articles." He put what he learned into practice, carrying out a revolution in the depths of his soul. As he said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works must touch the soul; a revolutionary's mind must not harbor any selfish thoughts." It was the great Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured him to rapidly grow into a communist warrior.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang is our good example. Every revolutionary should be like him, loving Chairman Mao to the utmost, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and making every effort to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. We must focus on transforming our worldview, thoroughly eliminating the bourgeois "self" and firmly establishing the proletarian "public."

We should be like Comrade Cai Yongxiang, extremely enthusiastic towards the people and extremely hateful towards the enemies. We should always maintain high revolutionary vigilance, firmly guard our posts, actively participate in, and resolutely defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We should be like Comrade Cai Yongxiang, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party and the people's revolutionary cause, and become selfless communist warriors.

    一心为公的共产主义战士
    ——向舍身抢救红卫兵列车的蔡永祥同志学习
    我们伟大领袖毛主席号召我们学习的张思德同志，白求恩同志，雷锋同志，都是具有崇高的共产主义精神的人。他们都毫无自私自利之心，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，全心全意地为人民服务。他们生为革命战斗，死为革命献身。他们是一心为公的共产主义战士。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在我们的军队和我们的国家里，千千万万个一心为公的共产主义战士，正在成长和涌现出来。蔡永祥同志，是又一个光辉的代表。
    当一辆满载红卫兵的列车突然面临危险的紧急关头，蔡永祥同志挺身而出，排除了阴险的阶级敌人在轨道上设下的障碍，用自己宝贵的生命，换取了列车上千百个阶级弟兄的安全。他那舍己为人的共产主义精神，将永远活在亿万人民的心里，成为鼓舞、激励、推动人们前进的力量。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是社会主义革命深入发展的新阶段，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争深入发展的新阶段。这场大革命，要巩固无产阶级专政，发展社会主义制度，挖掉资本主义、修正主义的根子，这就不能不遇到无产阶级的敌人、人民的敌人的疯狂反抗。
    但是，在伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，不管阶级敌人多么狡猾，他们的破坏和捣乱是不能得逞的。蔡永祥同志对阶级敌人保持着高度的警惕。他以英勇果敢的行动，粉碎了敌人的阴谋，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命作出了贡献。
    蔡永祥同志说过：在无产阶级和资产阶级这场你死我活的斗争中，我要把自己的一切献给党和人民！他在关键的时刻，忠实地履行了这个誓言。他不愧为毛主席的好战士，不愧为无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者。他的英雄行为，集中地表现出我军指战员对毛主席的无限忠诚，对红卫兵的无比热爱，对保卫无产阶级文化大革命的崇高的责任感。
    蔡永祥同志的一生，是完全、彻底为人民的一生。他生前的战友们说：“蔡永祥同志的头脑里，只有同志，只有他人，就是没有自己。”我们要完成伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，要逐步过渡到共产主义，就要培养千千万万个这样一心为公的共产主义新人。这样的人，就是毛主席说的高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。
    蔡永祥同志最热爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，最爱照毛主席的指示办事，最爱宣传毛泽东思想，最爱学习用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，最仇恨那些反对毛泽东思想的人。他学习毛主席著作，学得最多的是“老三篇”。他学了就用，在自己的灵魂深处闹革命。就像他所说的：“学习毛主席著作必须触及灵魂，革命战士的头脑里容不得半点私心杂念。”正是伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育，使他迅速地成长为一个共产主义战士。
    蔡永祥同志是我们的好榜样。每一个革命战士，都要像他那样，无限热爱毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。要狠抓世界观的改造，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字。
    我们要像蔡永祥同志那样，对人民极端热忱，对敌人极端仇恨。要时刻保持高度的革命警惕性，坚守战斗岗位，积极参加和坚决保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    我们要像蔡永祥同志那样，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党和人民的革命事业，做一个一心为公的共产主义战士。
