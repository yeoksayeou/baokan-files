I am a welder in the repair team. Doing maintenance work is like a military operation. We go wherever we are needed, whenever we are needed. Sometimes we have to take great risks. In such situations, we often study Chairman Mao's works and arm ourselves with great Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's words give me boundless strength.

One night, a water injection pipeline in the North Area ruptured and needed immediate repair. We rushed to the scene. Seeing the water gushing up more than a zhang high, with a pressure of ninety atmospheres, we were at a loss. The water kept gushing out, and no matter how many times we tried to block it, it just wouldn't stop. I was anxious, thinking, "If there were no pressure, it would only take a few minutes to weld it. But how can we weld it under such high pressure? I've never done this before, and I've never even heard of it. According to the operating procedures, you can't weld under pressure. But then I thought, the oil field is injecting water, and more water means more oil. Water is oil. The revisionists want to strangle us with oil. Socialism needs oil, and the revolutionary people need oil. For the sake of oil, we must risk our lives to do it!

How to weld under high pressure? We have to blaze a trail. I charged forward. Some comrades held me back, concerned, saying, "Molten iron meeting cold water turns into iron pellets, and under such high pressure, they fly out faster than bullets." Should I charge forward or retreat? I remembered Chairman Mao's words: "People will die eventually, but the meaning of death is different." "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." A revolutionary soldier must not retreat in the face of the enemy or run away when the battle starts. At this moment, the leadership mobilized the masses, coming up with many good ideas, which further boosted my confidence and determination. Holding the welding torch, I charged forward. But as soon as I lit the fire, "pfft," it was extinguished by the water. I tried several times, but it just wouldn't ignite.

It was already midnight. I tore a piece of cotton from the hole in my cotton-padded jacket, plugged the welding point a bit, used a screwdriver to hold it in place with one hand, and operated the welding torch with the other hand, finally igniting the fire. With the help of my comrades, we welded it bit by bit. When we got to the last part, there was still a hole the size of an eye, and the water was gushing out too strongly to weld it shut. We took a nut and used the method of welding the nut first and then screwing in the bolt. When screwing in the bolt, the ninety-atmosphere water flow was gushing out along the nut, and if we loosened our grip even a little, the bolt would fly out, posing a danger to our lives. I held the bolt and charged forward twice with a few comrades, finally managing to twist the bolt in and weld it tight.

This battle made me deeply realize that doing revolution is not smooth sailing; difficulties and dangers can arise at any time. The only way to deal with difficulties and dangers is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings: dare to struggle, dare to pioneer, dare to do, and charge forward in the face of difficulties. Only by spiritually overcoming difficulties can we conquer them in action.

    干革命就不能怕困难，怕危险。对待困难和危险，就要按照毛主席的教导，
    迎着困难冲上去
    大庆采油部电焊工　杨万全
    我是抢修班的电焊工。搞维修工作，就像军队打仗一样。哪里需要就到哪里去，什么时候需要什么时候到。有时还需要冒很大的危险。在这种情况下，我们就经常学习毛主席著作，用伟大的毛泽东思想来武装自己。毛主席的话，给了我无穷的力量。
    一天晚上，北区某注水干线破裂了，要立即抢修。我们立即赶到出事地点。一看，水喷起一丈多高，压力有九十个大气压。水越喷越大，堵来堵去，总堵不住。我急得要命，心想：要是没有压力，几分钟就能焊好。可是，现在那么高的压力怎么焊呢？别说自己没干过，连听都没听到过。按操作规程，带压就不能焊。可是又一想：油田正在投入注水，多注水就能多采油，水就是油。想到了油，心里就燃起了烈火。修正主义者想用石油卡我们的脖子。社会主义建设要油，革命人民要油。为了油，就是拚上命也要去干！
    压力高怎么焊？得闯出个经验来。我一下子就冲了上去。有的同志抓住了我，关切地说：“化了的铁水遇到冷水，就变成铁蛋子，在那么高的压力下飞出来，比子弹还厉害。”是冲上去，还是退下来？我想起了毛主席的话：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。”“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。一个革命战士，决不能临阵脱逃，打起仗来向后跑。这时，领导上发动群众，想出了不少好办法，进一步增强了我的信心和决心。我手握焊把，冲了上去。谁知刚一打火，“扑”地一下就被水打灭了，连打几次都没着。
    这时，已经是夜里十二点了。我从棉衣破口里扯下一块棉絮，把焊口堵住一点，一只手用螺丝刀顶住，一只手操作焊把打着了火。在同志们的帮助下，一点点地焊起来。焊到最后，还有眼睛大的圆洞，水喷过猛，说什么也焊不住。我们又拿了个螺母，采取先焊螺母、后上丝杆的办法。上丝杆的时候，九十个大气压的水流顺着螺母直往外冲，稍一松手，丝杆打出来，就有生命危险。我拿着丝杆连着往上冲了两次，终于和几个同志一起，七手八脚地把丝杆拧上焊死。
    这场战斗，使我深深体会到：干革命决不是一帆风顺的，随时都可能碰到困难、危险。对待困难、危险，唯一的办法就是按照毛主席的教导：敢于斗争，敢闯、敢干，迎着困难冲上去。只有在精神上压倒困难，才能在行动上战胜困难。
