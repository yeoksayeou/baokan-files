On October 1st, I stood on Tiananmen Gate and saw our greatest leader, Chairman Mao. This was the greatest happiness and the greatest honor of my life.

On the evening of the 30th, when I learned that I would be going to Tiananmen Gate, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. I repeatedly read Chairman Mao's Quotations. Although I had read them countless times, today they felt especially close to my heart and left a deep impression. I got up and wrote some study notes. I just wanted the day to hurry up and dawn so I could see our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

The long-awaited moment of greatest happiness finally arrived. On October 1st, the representatives for the National Day celebration ascended Tiananmen Gate. At 2:25 PM, Chairman Mao greeted us on the gate. When I saw Chairman Mao walking towards us with strong steps and waving to us, I was so moved that tears flowed down my face. I shouted loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" But I felt that even if I shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" a thousand times, ten thousand times, it still wouldn't fully express my boundless respect, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. We saw Chairman Mao with a radiant face, full of vitality, and in excellent health. I thought, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the great helmsman of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Your health is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. I had only one thought: May Chairman Mao live ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the brightest sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light, the lifeblood of our revolution. It is you who correctly lead our country's revolution, navigating past one reef after another, achieving one great victory after another. I myself, being able to do something for the people, and when comrades are in danger, being able to rush to rescue them without hesitation, all of this is done according to your teachings. You teach us to learn from Dr. Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness, his extreme dedication to work, and his extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people. It is your teachings that make me understand that caring for comrades is caring for the revolution; loving revolutionary comrades is loving the revolution. Therefore, in times of danger, I can, for the revolution and for rescuing class brothers, sacrifice everything.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, becoming your good soldier. I will definitely keep your instructions firmly in my heart and mind; learn and apply them in the struggle; forever be loyal to you, loyal to the Party, and pass down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation. We will definitely advance bravely on the course you have opened for us!

    毛主席教导我热爱战友
    福州部队空军某部管理员、爱兵模范　王裕昌
    十月一日，我在天安门城楼上见到了我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，这是我一生中最大的幸福，最大的光荣。
    三十日晚上，当我知道我将要去天安门城楼的时候，我兴奋得睡不着觉，就反复读毛主席语录。这些语录虽然学了不知多少遍了，但今天重读，感到特别亲切，印象特别深刻，字字都印在脑子里。我又起来写了一段学习笔记。我只想快天亮吧，天亮了我就可以见到最敬爱的领袖毛主席了。
    久已盼望的最幸福的时刻终于来到了。十月一日，国庆观礼的代表登上了天安门城楼。下午两点二十五分，毛主席在城楼上接见了我们。当我看到主席迈着健壮的步子，向我们走来并向我们不断招手的时候，我激动得流下泪来。我用力高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁！”但我感到即使高呼一千句一万句毛主席万岁，也不能完全表达出我对毛主席无限敬爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情。我们见到毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，身体非常健康。我想，毛主席呀，毛主席，您是中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大舵手，您的健康，是我们中国人民的最大幸福，也是世界革命人民的最大幸福。我只有一个念头：祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    毛主席呀，毛主席，您是我们心中最红最红的太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的指路明灯，是我们革命的命根子。是您正确领导着我国的革命，绕过了一个又一个的暗礁，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。我自己能够为人民作一点事情，遇到战友有危险的时候，能够奋不顾身去抢救，也都是按照您的教导去做的。您教导我们，要学习白求恩那种毫不利己专门利人的精神，学习白求恩对工作的极端负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。是您的教导，使我认识到，关心同志就是关心革命；热爱革命同志，就是热爱革命，因而在危险的时刻，我能够为革命、为抢救阶级弟兄，不惜豁出自己的一切。
    毛主席呀，毛主席，我要永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我一定把您的指示，牢牢地记在心上，印在脑子里；在斗争中学，在斗争中用；永远忠于您，忠于党，把毛泽东思想一代一代永远传下去。我们一定在您开辟的航道上，奋勇前进！
