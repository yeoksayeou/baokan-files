Jiangxi's main economic crops, such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea, which have been harvested or are currently being harvested, have all yielded better results than last year. Citrus fruits are laden with fruits, and sugarcane is growing well, both of which are expected to surpass last year's production.

Among all the economic crops, hemp and tobacco have seen significant increases in production. The number of units achieving large-scale high yields has increased significantly compared to last year. The quality of the various economic crop products that have been harvested is also better than in previous years.

This year, Jiangxi's climate conditions have been unfavorable. The early period experienced prolonged rain and low temperatures, while the later period experienced prolonged drought, both of which had adverse effects on the growth of economic crops. However, the broad masses of community members studied "The Three Articles" and "Farewell to Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," raising their morale and overcoming natural disasters. They achieved a double harvest in both ideology and production.

    江西省经济作物收成好
    江西各地已经收获或正在收获的棉花、黄麻、烟草、茶叶等主要经济作物，收成都好于去年。柑桔结实累累，甘蔗长势良好，也将比去年增产。
    各项经济作物中，以黄麻、烟草增产幅度较大。获得大面积高产的单位比去年增加很多。已收的各种经济作物产品的质量都比往年好。
    今年江西的气候条件不好。前期久雨低温，后期久晴干旱，都给经济作物生长带来不利影响。但是，广大社员学习了
  “老三篇”和《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，提高了斗志，战胜了自然灾害，取得了思想、生产双丰收。
