Who says "bad"? Who says "good"?

The Party Branch Secretary of Tongbi Commune in Gui County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Tan Jinsuo (Zhuang nationality)

Zhou Yang shouts: "The slogan of writing, performing, singing, and painting the center is inappropriate." This is a brazen opposition to the service of literature and art to proletarian politics, attempting to lead our literature and art down the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao has long told us: literature and art belong to a certain political line. Since the establishment of the cultural room in our Tongbi Commune, we have always followed Chairman Mao's instructions. Whatever central task comes up, we write and perform about it. The songs change people's spirits, leading to bountiful harvests. In 1963, our commune encountered a once-in-a-century drought. Landlord elements took the opportunity to deceive the masses into praying for rain instead of fighting the drought. We countered this by composing songs to dispel superstitions and emphasize human victory over nature, raising the masses' awareness and uniting the entire commune to fight the drought. This resulted in an unusually good harvest.

Zhou Yang maliciously slanders the works written and performed by workers, peasants, and soldiers as "vulgar," "simplistic," "formulaic," and "short-lived." However, the poor and lower-middle peasants say our service to the center is "very good." The poor and lower-middle peasants say:

"Your performances strongly propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making people's eyes bright and hearts clear."

"Your programs provide spiritual nourishment, making people full of energy and enthusiastic about labor."

"Your programs sing about our own village and perform our own village's stories, the more we listen, the more we enjoy, the more we watch, the more we love to watch."

Regarding "writing the center, performing the center," who says "bad"? It is the Zhou Yang clique; who says "good"? It is we revolutionary people, we poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The cultural room of our Tongbi Commune will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unwaveringly write the center, perform the center, and serve proletarian politics for life.

### 谁个说“糟”？谁个说“好”？

    谁个说“糟”？谁个说“好”？
    广西壮族自治区贵县同闭公社党支部书记  覃进校（壮族）
    周扬叫嚷：“写中心，演中心，唱中心，画中心的口号是不恰当的。”这是猖狂地反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，妄想把我们的文艺引到资产阶级的邪路上去。
    毛主席早就告诉我们：文艺是属于一定的政治路线的。我们同闭公社文化室从创办以来，就一直按照毛主席的指示办事，什么中心任务来了，我们就编什么，演什么。唱得人的精神大变样，生产大丰收。一九六三年，我社遇到百年未遇的大旱灾，地主分子乘机活动，欺骗群众去求神祈雨，不去抗旱。我们针锋相对，编了破除迷信、人定胜天的抗旱歌，去提高群众的觉悟，把全社群众团结起来，合力抗旱，使夏收获得少见的好收成。
    周扬恶毒地污蔑工农兵写中心、演中心的作品是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“公式化”、“短命鬼”。可是，贫下中农却说我们为中心服务“好得很”。贫下中农说：
    “你们演出的节目，大力宣传毛泽东思想，叫人看了眼睛明，心里亮。”
    “你们的节目，使人思想添养料，浑身长力气，劳动增干劲。”
    “你们的节目，唱的本村人，演的本村事，越听越有味，越看越爱看。”
    对于“写中心、演中心”，谁个说“糟”？是周扬一伙；谁个说“好”？是我们革命人民，我们贫下中农。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们同闭公社文化室一定按照毛主席的教导，坚定不移地写中心，演中心，一辈子为无产阶级政治服务。
