A shining example of thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's great educational thoughts, a model of a proletarian revolutionary school—the history exhibition of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (referred to as the Anti-Japanese University)—is currently being displayed across the country. Broad revolutionary masses, after visiting the exhibition, are greatly inspired and deeply educated, expressing their determination to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the Anti-Japanese University, to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly reform education, and to establish our schools as the most advanced, most revolutionary, and most progressive Anti-Japanese style schools.

After the Anti-Japanese University history exhibition was displayed at the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum in Beijing, it sparked a strong response among the audience. Broad workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary students from all over the country hoped to see this exhibition. To meet the demands of revolutionary masses from various places, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum specially made over three hundred copies of the entire exhibition and sent them to various parts of the country. Currently, the exhibition has been displayed in cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Wuhan, Tianjin, Harbin, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Lanzhou, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Nanning, Hohhot, Baoding, and Yinchuan.

During the exhibition period, broad workers, peasants, revolutionary students, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from various places continuously visited the exhibition. In Shanghai, over ten days, more than ten thousand viewers visited the exhibition. Many revolutionary students traveled hundreds of miles to the provincial capital to visit the exhibition. Some, after visiting once, were still not satisfied and visited it a second or third time. Many viewers brought notebooks with them, copying many inscriptions by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao into their notebooks. Viewers generally felt that, in the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution, revisiting the revolutionary traditions of the Anti-Japanese University was the most vivid, profound, and lively class of Mao Zedong Thought education, thereby deepening their boundless love, faith, and adoration for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Engineer Zhou Zhenhua, a worker from the Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory, said, "We will turn the factory into an Anti-Japanese style school of Mao Zedong Thought, forging ourselves into new-type workers who can both write and fight, and criticize the bourgeoisie." Many knowledge youth who went to the countryside and settled down in Xi'an expressed their determination to learn from the shining example of the Anti-Japanese University, turning the countryside into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Retired worker Wang Jingtian, over seventy years old from Baoding, said excitedly after visiting the exhibition, "Although I am retired, my heart cannot retire, and my thoughts cannot retire. I will strive to study Chairman Mao's works and follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end." Many old comrades who once studied at the Anti-Japanese University and are now working in Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Changsha, and Yinchuan felt very familiar after visiting the exhibition, determining to forever inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions and revolutionary spirit of the Anti-Japanese University, making the study, implementation, promotion, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought their lifelong combat mission, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

Many revolutionary students held discussions after visiting the Anti-Japanese University history exhibition. They said that visiting the exhibition in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution added to their fighting courage and strength. Revolutionary students and Red Guards from higher education institutions in Zhengzhou, who had just returned from the "three autumns" frontline in the countryside, said excitedly after visiting the exhibition, "Chairman Mao's great educational thoughts are the most correct and brilliant. The Anti-Japanese University is the most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive school in the world. We will definitely take the Anti-Japanese University as an example, resolutely follow the road of the Anti-Japanese University, establish Anti-Japanese style schools, thoroughly smash the old educational system, and let the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the battlefield of proletarian education." A female student from Lanzhou wrote a poem full of enthusiasm and ambition after visiting the exhibition: "Revolutionary predecessors built great achievements, the Anti-Japanese University's fame spreads both at home and abroad; inheriting the revolutionary spirit of our predecessors, the Anti-Japanese University will definitely have successors." Many young revolutionaries proudly said: We will definitely follow the road of the Anti-Japanese University, let imperialism and modern revisionism cry in despair, we, the younger generation, will forever be the red successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Many soldiers and students from military academies of the People's Liberation Army expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call after visiting the exhibition, turning the army into a revolutionary school, being able to farm with a hoe, work with a hammer, fight with a gun, and criticize the bourgeoisie with a pen, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, defending the iron-clad mountains and rivers of the proletariat, and ensuring they remain unchanged for thousands of generations.

    人民解放军许多指战员和军事院校的师生们参观以后，一致表示，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，把部队办成革命化的大学校，拿起锄头会种地，拿起锤子会做工，拿起枪杆能打仗，拿起笔杆能批判资产阶级，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，保卫无产阶级铁打的江山，千秋万代永不变色。
