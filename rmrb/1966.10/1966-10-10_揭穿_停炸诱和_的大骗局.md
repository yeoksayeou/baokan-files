The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique have been colluding, using this session of the United Nations General Assembly as the center, to push forward their "peace talks" conspiracy on the Vietnam issue, becoming increasingly blatant and arrogant.

On September 22, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, threw out the so-called "three-point proposal" at the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, Gromyko and Fedlin had long discussions with Johnson and Rusk, or had lunches together, or expressed that Soviet-American relations were "becoming closer and closer," almost like brothers, getting along very well. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union and the United States, their followers were very active, and various "peace talks" plans were put forward one after another. The British Labour government proposed the so-called "six-point proposal"; the Vatican issued a so-called "peace" appeal; the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant reiterated his "three-point" plan; India and Yugoslavia were also busy promoting the "peace talks" deception. All these facts show that the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are launching a new large-scale "peace offensive" around the Vietnam issue.

What tricks are the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists playing in this "peace offensive"? We only need to analyze the U.S. "three-point proposal" to see clearly.

The first point of the U.S. proposal is: the United States can "first stop bombing North Vietnam," on the condition that the Vietnamese people "take corresponding and timely steps to reduce or stop" "military activities."

This point, in short, is a deception. The only way to restore peace in Vietnam is to immediately withdraw all armed forces of the United States and its followers from Vietnam, not the issue of temporarily stopping bombing the North. Johnson began large-scale bombing of North Vietnam in February last year, with the purpose of forcing the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks." The method was to bomb for a while, stop for a while, bomb to "force peace," stop to "lure peace." "Bombing to force peace" doesn't work, so they resort to "stopping bombing to lure peace." For more than a year, bombing and stopping have been played twice, and now they want to play stopping again. This old trick has been seen through by the people.

It must be pointed out that bombing is indeed unadulterated war blackmail, and stopping is also genuine war blackmail. At the same time as the United States put forward the "three-point proposal," U.S. imperialism crazily increased troops in South Vietnam and deployed a new "dry season offensive." There are reports that the Johnson administration has planned for U.S. troops to land near the temporary military demarcation line. This means that the U.S. imperialists' plan is: if they can deceive, they will deceive; if they cannot deceive, they will fight big.

The second point of the U.S. proposal is: "The United States is ready at any time to withdraw its troops when others withdraw their troops," and is "willing to agree on" a "schedule for the withdrawal of all foreign troops."

This is outrageous! The "foreign troops" in Vietnam are the troops of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. This invading army should have been kicked out of Vietnam long ago, and there is no room for bargaining. As long as there is one U.S. soldier on Vietnamese soil, the 31 million Vietnamese people have the right to take any means to wage an anti-American national revolutionary war. Calling the South Vietnamese people's armed forces "foreign troops" is a vicious slander against the heroic Vietnamese people and is also an excuse for the U.S. aggressors to stay in Vietnam.

The third point of the U.S. proposal is that the "position of the Viet Cong in the negotiations" "will not be an insurmountable problem."

Many people who do not understand the truth think that this point is a concession by the United States, but in fact, it is a very dangerous deception. The United States has not acknowledged that the National Liberation Front is the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people. It only expresses that it can give the National Liberation Front a seat at the negotiating table set up by the United States to sit together with the U.S. puppet in Saigon. This is the old trick of the U.S. imperialists trying to copy the three-carriage system of Laos, using the so-called united government to obtain what they cannot get on the battlefield.

It must be pointed out that the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant's so-called "three-point" plan appears neutral but is actually a genuine U.S. product. Just compare the U.S. "three-point proposal" with U Thant's "three-point" plan, and the matter becomes clearer. U Thant's first point is to "stop bombing North Vietnam," and the U.S.'s first point is to "stop bombing North Vietnam"; the difference is that the U.S. makes the condition for stopping the bombing clearer, while U Thant hides the condition for stopping the bombing in his so-called second point, that is, both sides reduce "military activities"; it cannot be said that U Thant is more just than the U.S., but it can be said that U Thant is as cunning as the U.S. As for U Thant's reduction of "military activities" by both sides and the U.S.'s second point of both sides withdrawing troops, they are two sides of the same coin, birds of a feather. U Thant's third point is "the National Liberation Front participates in any peaceful resolution," and the U.S.'s third point is that the "position of the Viet Cong in the negotiations" is not "insurmountable." Look, U Thant's "three-point" plan and the U.S.'s "three-point proposal" are not exactly the same?

Whether it is the U.S.'s "three-point proposal," U Thant's "three-point" plan, or other various "peace talks" plans, their core content is to use the cessation of bombing North Vietnam as bait to exchange for the Vietnamese people stopping their struggle and accepting "peace talks," to exchange for the right of the U.S. aggressors to stay in South Vietnam. This is certainly unacceptable to the heroic Vietnamese people. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out in his call: "The United States must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, must withdraw all U.S. troops and their accomplice troops from Vietnam, and then peace will be immediately restored. The position of Vietnam is clear: this is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Apart from this, there is no other way!"

The reason why the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists and their followers want to engage in "peace talks" conspiracy activities in the United Nations is to use the concern of the majority of United Nations member states about the expansion of the Vietnam War to serve their "peace talks" deception, and to try to link the Vietnam issue with the United Nations, creating a fait accompli of the United Nations' illegal intervention in the Vietnam issue. This big conspiracy must be exposed. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have repeatedly clearly stated that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue. All countries with a sense of justice should firmly support the just position of the Vietnamese people and firmly oppose the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists using the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue.

On the Vietnam issue, right and wrong are clear. The United States is the aggressor, and Vietnam is the victim. The U.S. aggression against Vietnam must be strongly condemned, and the U.S. aggressor troops must be immediately and completely withdrawn from Vietnam. On this principle issue, there is absolutely no room for compromise. Asian and African countries that still have fresh memories of the pain of imperialist and colonialist aggression cannot compromise. All countries that uphold justice cannot compromise. The majority of countries participating in the United Nations General Assembly are naturally concerned about the serious situation caused by the U.S. aggression against Vietnam. But in order to prevent this natural concern from being used by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, it is necessary to strongly expose the big conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet Union using the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue, and to take various possible means outside the United Nations to strongly condemn the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, and to unanimously demand that the U.S. and its accomplice aggressor troops immediately, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly get out of the sacred territory of the Vietnamese people. Otherwise, calling for peace without distinguishing right from wrong, echoing the U.S.'s "bombing halt to lure peace" deception, and allowing the U.S. to succeed in its conspiracy to use the United Nations, the result can only be to help the "peace talks" conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, only to encourage the U.S. to further expand its war of aggression against Vietnam, and further threaten the independence of the peoples of various countries and world peace.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that it is impossible to hope that imperialists will "have a change of heart and turn back." The only way is to organize forces to struggle against them. Today, the 31 million Vietnamese people are responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, organizing their own forces, and bravely fighting against the U.S. aggressors. The great Vietnamese people are invincible. No matter what "peace talks" tricks the U.S. imperialists play, no matter what military adventures they plot, their ultimate failure is inevitable.

### 揭穿“停炸诱和”的大骗局

    揭穿“停炸诱和”的大骗局
    美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团相互勾结，以这一届联合国大会为中心，在越南问题上推行“和谈”阴谋，越来越露骨，越来越嚣张了。
    九月二十二日，美国驻联合国代表戈德堡在联合国大会上抛出了美国的所谓“三点建议”。与此同时，葛罗米柯、费德林同约翰逊、腊斯克之间，或作长时间会谈，或相约共进午餐，或彼此表白苏美关系“越来越接近”，简直是亲如手足，打得火热。在苏美的带头之下，他们的追随者大肆活动，各种“和谈”方案纷纷出笼。英国工党政府提出了所谓“六点建议”；梵蒂冈发出了所谓“和平”呼吁；联合国秘书长吴丹重申他的“三点”方案；印度和南斯拉夫也在为推销“和谈”骗局而奔走。种种事实表明，美帝和苏修围绕着越南问题，正在发动一个新的大规模的“和平攻势”。
    美帝和苏修在这一次“和平攻势”中究竟是在玩弄什么把戏，我们只要分析一下美国的“三点建议”，就一清二楚了。
    美国的第一点建议是：美国可以“先对北越停止轰炸”，条件是越南人民“采取相应的、及时的步骤来减少或停止”“军事活动”。
    这一条，说来说去，其实就是一个“骗”字。恢复越南和平的唯一途径，是立即从越南撤走美国及其追随者的一切武装力量，而不是什么对北方暂停轰炸的问题。约翰逊去年二月开始对越南北方进行大规模轰炸，其目的就是为了诱迫越南人民接受“和谈”，其作法是炸一阵，停一阵，炸是为了“迫和”，停是为了“诱和”。“以炸迫和”不行，就又搞“停炸诱和”。一年多以来，炸炸停停已经耍过两次，现在又要耍停，这种老手法，人们早就看透了。
    必须指出，炸固然是不折不扣的战争讹诈，停也是地地道道的战争讹诈。就在美国端出“三点建议”的同时，美帝国主义疯狂地向越南南方增兵，部署发动新的“旱季攻势”。有消息透露，约翰逊政府已经策划了美军在临时军事分界线附近登陆的计划。这就是说，美帝国主义的打算是：骗得了就骗，骗不了就大打。
    美国的第二点建议是：“美国随时准备在别人撤出军队时撤出自己的军队”，并且“愿意商定”一份“撤出一切外来军队的时间表”。
    真是岂有此理！在越南的“外来军队”，就是美帝国主义及其帮凶的军队。这支侵略军，早就应当从越南滚蛋，根本没有什么讨价还价的余地。只要在越南土地上还有一个美国兵，三千一百万越南人民就有权采取任何方式，进行反美民族革命战争。把南越人民武装说成是“外来军队”，这是对英勇的越南人民的恶毒诬蔑，也是美国侵略者企图赖在越南不走的借口。
    美国的第三点建议是：“越共在谈判中的地位”“不会是一个不可解决的问题”。
    许多不明真相的人以为这一条是美国的“让步”，其实这是一个极端危险的骗局。美国并没有承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一合法代表，它只是表示可以在美国摆下的谈判桌旁，给民族解放阵线一把椅子，同美国的西贡傀儡坐在一起。这是美帝国主义企图抄袭老挝的三套马车的老办法，用所谓联合政府的手段来取得它在战场上得不到的东西。
    必须指出，联合国秘书长吴丹的所谓“三点”方案，貌似中立，其实是地地道道的美国货。只要把美国的“三点建议”同吴丹的“三点”方案，作一比较，事情就更清楚了。吴丹的第一点是“停止对北越的轰炸”，美国的第一点是“对北越停止轰炸”；所不同者美国把停炸的条件说得明白些，而吴丹却把停炸的条件隐藏在它的所谓第二条里，即双方减少“军事活动”；绝不能说吴丹比美国公正，只能说吴丹同美国一样阴险。至于说吴丹的双方减少“军事活动”和美国第二点的双方撤兵，更是半斤八两，一丘之貉。吴丹的第三点是“民族解放阵线参加任何和平解决”，美国的第三点是“越共在谈判中的地位”不是“不可解决的”。请看，吴丹的“三点”方案和美国的“三点建议”不是一模一样的吗？
    无论是美国的“三点建议”，还是吴丹的“三点”方案，以及其他形形色色的“和谈”方案，其中心内容都是以停炸越南北方作为钓饵，来换取越南人民停止斗争、接受“和谈”，来换取美国侵略者赖在越南南方的权利。这当然是英雄的越南人民所不能接受的。正如胡志明主席在号召书中所指出的：“美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。越南的立场是明确的：这就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。此外，没有其他办法！”
    美帝和苏修及其追随者所以要在联合国大搞“和谈”阴谋活动，其罪恶目的就是要利用联合国的多数国家担心越南战争扩大的心理，来为它们的“和谈”骗局服务，并且企图把越南问题同联合国挂上钩，造成联合国非法干预越南问题的既成事实。对于这样一个大阴谋，必须予以揭穿。越南民主共和国政府和越南南方民族解放阵线曾经多次明确声明，联合国无权干涉越南问题。一切有正义感的国家，都应该坚决支持越南人民的正义立场，都应该坚决反对美帝和苏修利用联合国干预越南问题。
    在越南问题上，是非是清清楚楚的。美国是侵略者，越南是被侵略者。美国对越南的侵略必须受到强烈谴责，美国的侵略军必须立即全部撤出越南。在这个原则问题上，是绝对不能妥协的。对于帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略苦痛记忆犹新的亚非国家绝不能妥协。一切主持正义的国家也绝不能妥协。参加联合国大会的多数国家对美国侵略越南所造成的严重局势表示关切是十分自然的。但为了使这种理所当然的关心不为美帝国主义和苏联修正主义所利用，就必须大力揭露美苏利用联合国干预越南问题的大阴谋，并且在联合国外采取各种可能的方式，大力谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的滔天罪行，一致要求美国及其帮凶的侵略军立即、全部、彻底、干净地滚出越南人民的神圣国土。否则，不分是非地呼吁和平，附和美国“停炸诱和”的骗局，并且让美国利用联合国的阴谋得逞，其结果只能是为美国和苏修的“和谈”阴谋帮忙，只能鼓励美国进一步扩大侵略越南的战争，进一步威胁各国人民的独立和世界和平。
    毛泽东同志指出，希望劝说帝国主义者“发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。今天，三千一百万越南人民正在响应胡志明主席的号召书，组织自己的力量，同美国侵略者进行英勇的斗争。伟大的越南人民是不可战胜的。美帝国主义不论玩弄什么“和谈”花招，不论策划什么军事冒险，它的最后失败都是不可避免的。
