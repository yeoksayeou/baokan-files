Guangzhou City Holds a Week-Long Performance of Revolutionary Arts by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 9th: Guangzhou City recently held a grand week-long performance of revolutionary arts by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Over 800 workers, peasants, and revolutionary students, who are amateur cultural warriors, took the stage with heads held high. With the deepest class sentiments, they sang praises to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They fully demonstrated the resolute will of workers, peasants, and soldiers to occupy the cultural front and to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

This revolutionary and magnificent arts performance lasted for eight days and concluded on October 5th. During the week, a total of 49 performances were held, featuring over 170 items, attracting more than 120,000 spectators. Among the items, over 150 were created or adapted by workers, peasants, and revolutionary students themselves. It was the first time in Guangzhou's 17-year history of arts performances that so many workers, peasants, and amateur cultural warriors gathered for such a concentrated performance of such a large number of clearly defined items.

As the curtain rose, a red sun was seen rising in the background. Over 200 workers, peasants, and revolutionary students sang together on stage, performing revolutionary songs such as "The East is Red," "The Ship Sails on Because of the Helmsman," and "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers March at the Forefront of the Revolution." These amateur performers were all from the front lines of production and combat. Most of them were performing on stage for the first time, with many being model workers, model peasants, model soldiers, and active learners of Chairman Mao's works. The oldest was 62 years old, and the youngest was only 12. They solemnly declared: The time for workers, peasants, and soldiers to occupy the arts stage has begun. The audience below thundered with applause.

The workers of Guangzhou Chemical Factory performed the drum poem "The Spirit of Guangzhou Chemical Workers," showcasing the bold spirit of the working class under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Workers in work clothes, led by a young worker carrying a large drum overhead, marched onto the stage with quick steps. After a series of drumbeats, they loudly recited: "Red flags fly everywhere in the wind, Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly! Hammers are raised to create great deeds, wrenches turn the world upside down, pipes lead to Beijing, hearts embrace the country and look at the world. Hey! For the Chinese revolution, for the liberation of all mankind..." The powerful lines and thunderous drumbeats fully demonstrated that the Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are the masters who stand tall and create the world. Four old poor peasants from the Red Guards Commune in Huacheng County performed "Old Poor Peasants Study Chairman Mao's Works" in the folk form of "three-sentence-half." They used several percussion instruments to accompany their performance, sharing their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works. The amateur performance team of soldiers from the Guangzhou garrison performed the poem "Chairman Mao in Military Uniform," depicting the moving scene of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao standing side by side on Tiananmen. They also used poetic language to recall the great scenes of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese revolution from victory to victory. When they recited, "Chairman Mao wears a green military uniform, the people's soldiers also wear green uniforms, the same red stars, the same red badges, wearing Chairman Mao's revolutionary uniform, never forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings..." the soldiers' boundless love and admiration for the great commander Chairman Mao resonated deeply with the audience. The revolutionary students participating in the performance performed songs and dances such as "Red Guards Sing Praises to Chairman Mao" and "Forever Be Good Soldiers of Chairman Mao," fully showcasing their vibrant revolutionary spirit nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

Throughout the performance week, the performance was guided by the red line of Mao Zedong Thought. The amateur cultural warriors of workers, peasants, and soldiers fully recognized that occupying the arts stage is a major political task. Every item performed was a cannon shot aimed at the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" and the bourgeois artistic frameworks. Therefore, they practiced diligently during rehearsals and performed with utmost seriousness. During the performance week, not only were there simultaneous performances in eight theaters across the city, but they also performed on the streets at propaganda stations. After the performance week, they will also perform in rural areas and factories.

    广州市举行工农兵革命文艺演出周
    据新华社广州九日电  广州市最近举行了规模盛大的工农兵革命文艺演出周。八百多名工农兵和革命学生业余文艺战士，昂首阔步登上文艺舞台，用最真挚最深厚的阶级感情，歌颂最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，充分显示了工农兵占领文化阵地，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强意志。
    这次革命气势磅礴的文艺演出周，历时八天，于十月五日闭幕。演出周中一共演出四十九场，一百七十多个节目，观众达十二万多人。节目中有一百五十多个是工农兵和革命学生自己创作或改编的。在一次演出活动中集中这样多的工农兵业余文艺战士，演出这样多旗帜鲜明的节目，在广州市十七年来的文艺演出史上还是第一次。
    帷幕拉开，背景上一轮红日喷薄升起。二百多名工农兵和革命学生同台歌唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《工农兵革命路上打先锋》等革命歌曲。这些工农兵业余演员，都是来自生产、战斗第一线。他们绝大多数是首次登上文艺舞台，其中有许多是五好职工、五好社员、五好战士，还有许多是学习毛主席著作积极分子，年纪最大的已有六十二岁，最小的只有十二岁。他们庄严地宣告：工农兵占领文艺舞台的时刻开始了。台下观众掌声雷动。
    广州化工厂工人表演的锣鼓词《广化工人志气豪》，表现了工人阶级在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，勇于冲锋陷阵的豪迈气概。身穿工作服的工人演员，由一个手托大鼓过顶的青年工人带领，以急速的步伐走上舞台，在一阵紧似一阵的擂鼓声过后，他们响亮地朗诵：“红旗处处迎风飘，毛泽东思想放光彩！铁锤高举创大业，扳手摆动转乾坤，管道条条通北京，胸怀祖国看世界。嘿！为了中国革命，为了全人类解放……”响当当的台词和震天动地的锣鼓声，充分显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，是顶天立地创造世界的主人。花县红卫兵公社四位老贫农，用发自内心的最深厚的阶级感情，以“三句半”的民间说唱形式演唱了《老贫农学毛著》。他们用几种打击乐器配合，演唱了学习毛主席著作的体会。广州驻军战士业余演出队的诗表演《毛主席穿军装》，描绘了毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志并肩站在天安门上的动人场面，并且用诗的语言回忆了毛主席引导中国革命从胜利走向胜利的伟大情景。当他们朗诵到“毛主席身穿绿军装，人民战士也穿绿军装，一样的红五星，一样的红领章，身穿毛主席的革命装，毛主席的教导永不忘……”时，人民战士对伟大统帅毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰的感情，激起了观众的强烈的共鸣。参加演出的革命学生，演出了歌舞《红卫兵战士歌颂毛主席》、《永远做毛主席的好战士》等节目，充分表现出他们在毛泽东思想哺育下，朝气蓬勃的革命精神面貌。
    演出周的整个演出，贯串着一条毛泽东思想的红线。工农兵业余文艺战士充分认识到，占领文艺舞台是一项重大的政治任务，演出的每一个节目，都是射向资产阶级反动“权威”和资产阶级艺术框框的炮弹，因此他们在排练过程中勤学苦练，在演出中又极端认真。演出周中，不仅在全市八个剧场同时演出，还上街到宣传站表演。演出周结束后，他们还将分别到农村和工厂表演。
