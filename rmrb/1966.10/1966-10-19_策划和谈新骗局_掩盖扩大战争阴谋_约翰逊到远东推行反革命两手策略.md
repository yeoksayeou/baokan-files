Johnson, the war hawk, departed Washington on the 17th and arrived in Honolulu, beginning his tour of East Asia under the guise of "peace" while actually aiming to escalate the war in Vietnam.

The U.S. government's leader personally embarked on this East Asian tour, indicating that the U.S.'s policy of aggression in Vietnam has encountered unprecedented difficulties. The desperate Johnson administration, in a last-ditch effort, has dispatched high-ranking officials to engage in frenzied activities, pushing forward a counter-revolutionary strategy of "peace" and war.

During his planned two-week tour of East Asia, Johnson's main agenda includes participating in the "Seven-Nation" summit scheduled for October 24th and 25th in Manila, attended by the U.S., the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the puppet regimes of South Vietnam and South Korea. Before and after this summit, he will also visit Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, "Malaysia," and South Korea.

In recent speeches, Johnson has repeatedly sworn that the purpose of his East Asian tour is "peace," claiming that the U.S. will work with its "partners" to achieve a "decent peace" in Southeast Asia as soon as possible. However, it is this very Johnson who, in the same speeches, has once again exposed his true intentions. In his speech on the 17th in Honolulu, he shouted that the agenda for the Manila meeting includes "all major issues related to the war." In his press conference on the 13th, he stated that the U.S.'s participation in the Manila meeting is to "review the commitments we made six months ago" (during his meeting with the head of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, Nguyen Cao Ky, in Honolulu in February) and to "implement the U.S. plan." Everyone knows that since that meeting, the U.S. has continued to suffer defeats in South Vietnam, with increasing casualties, yet it persists with its policy of "gradual escalation," continually intensifying the war in Vietnam.

To conceal the war-aggravating nature of the Manila meeting and to prepare public opinion for the U.S. to further "escalate" the war, the Johnson administration has recently not only had its representative Goldberg propose a three-point "peace talk" in the United Nations but has also colluded with the Soviet revisionist clique to intensify efforts to serve the U.S.'s policy of "bombing for peace" in Vietnam. It has also conspired with UN Secretary-General U Thant and the British Labour government to propose various "peace talks." However, regardless of whether it is the U.S.'s own "peace proposal" or the proposals of its lackeys, the essence is to enable the U.S. to achieve at the negotiating table what it cannot achieve on the battlefield, that is, to force the Vietnamese people to surrender under the increasing pressure of U.S. imperialism and to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

While launching this "peace offensive," the Johnson administration, on the eve of the Manila meeting, dispatched its Secretary of Defense, McNamara, to South Vietnam for his eighth inspection of the battlefield. It also held a military meeting in Honolulu, attended by the Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific, Sharp, and the head of U.S. forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland.

The U.S. Christian Science Monitor, in commenting on Johnson's East Asian tour, revealed the U.S.'s intentions. The newspaper said: "In Manila, the U.S. and its allies will coordinate and redefine their terms for peace in Vietnam. If these terms are rejected, McNamara will prepare the U.S. war machine for new offensives." However, the same newspaper has no confidence in the success of U.S. imperialism's plans. The Christian Science Monitor acknowledged on the 14th that the U.S. war in Vietnam is facing failures everywhere and has an "uncertain future."

### 策划和谈新骗局　掩盖扩大战争阴谋  约翰逊到远东推行反革命两手策略

    策划和谈新骗局　掩盖扩大战争阴谋
    约翰逊到远东推行反革命两手策略
    新华社十八日讯　战争瘟神约翰逊十七日离开华盛顿到达檀香山，开始了他的打着“和平”旗号，行扩大侵越战争之实的远东地区之行。
    美国政府头子亲自出马到远东活动，这表明美国在越南的侵略政策已经陷入空前的困难，焦头烂额的约翰逊政府为了进行垂死的挣扎，不得不出动政府要员到处进行活动，加紧推行反革命的“和”、战两手策略。
    约翰逊在预定为期两周的远东地区之行中，主要的节目，是参加十月二十四、五两日在马尼拉召开的由美国、菲律宾、泰国、澳大利亚、新西兰等五国政府和南越、南朝鲜等两个傀儡政权凑成的所谓“七国”首脑会议，并且在参加这次会议前后，访问澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、“马来西亚”和南朝鲜等国家和地区。
    约翰逊在他最近的一些谈话中，一再赌咒发誓，说他这次远东之行“目的是为了和平”，美国将同它的“伙伴一起争取一有可能就使东南亚实现体面的和平”。但是，就是这个约翰逊，就是在他的这些谈话中，却再一次作了生动的自我暴露，他十七日在檀香山发表的讲话中叫嚷说，马尼拉会议“议程上的是战争的一切方面的重大问题”。他在十三日的记者招待会上还说，美国出席马尼拉会议的目的是“研究我们在六个月前（即他同南越傀儡集团头子阮高其二月间在檀香山举行会议时）承担的义务”，“贯彻美国的计划”。谁都知道，自从那次会议以来，美国在南越战场上继续屡吃败仗，兵员伤亡越来越大，但是它仍然坚持“逐步升级”的侵越政策，不断加剧侵越战争。
    约翰逊政府为了掩盖马尼拉会议策划加剧战争的性质，并为美国使战争进一步“升级”作舆论准备，最近不仅由它自己的代表戈德堡在联合国抛出了一个三点“和谈”建议，而且同苏联修正主义集团打得火热，要它加紧为美国对越南的“以炸迫和”政策效劳。它还勾结联合国秘书长吴丹和英国工党政府，抛出各种“和谈”建议。但是，万变不离其宗，不管是美国自己的“和平建议”还是它的走狗的各种“和平建议”，其实质都是要使美国能够在谈判桌上取得它在战场上所无法取得的东西，就是要使越南人民在美帝国主义不断增加的压力面前屈服、投降，扼杀越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    约翰逊政府在发动这个“和平攻势”的同时，在马尼拉会议前夕派出了它的国防部长麦克纳马拉到南越战场进行第八次视察，并且在檀香山举行了有太平洋美国武装部队总司令夏普和侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰等人参加的军事会议。
    美国《基督教科学箴言报》在评论约翰逊的远东之行时道出了美国的打算。这家报纸说：“在马尼拉，美国和它的盟国将协调和重新规定它们关于越南和平的条款，如果这些条款遭到拒绝，麦克纳马拉就使美国战争机器为新的进军作好准备”。但是，同是这家报纸，对于美帝国主义的打算能否实现也毫无信心。《基督教科学箴言报》十四日在一篇报道中承认，美国侵越战争是处处失利，“前途渺茫”。
