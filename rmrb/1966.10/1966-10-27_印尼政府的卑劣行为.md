	The Indonesian government has committed a despicable act. At the end of August this year, Lieutenant General Panggabean, the Deputy Commander of the Indonesian Army, reported the results of the army's second meeting to the Chairman of the Cabinet, General Suharto, and proposed to alter the name of the People's Republic of China. Subsequently, the Indonesian official news agency, radio stations, television, and newspapers all maliciously changed the name of the People's Republic of China to the "Republic of Zhina" and referred to Chinese residents as "Zhina residents." The Acting Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Dja, in his press conference on September 20, and the statement by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on September 23 regarding China's dispatch of ships to rescue the affected Chinese residents, also openly used the same derogatory terms. This clearly shows that the alteration of China's national name was orchestrated by the Indonesian government. This is a grave insult to the Chinese people. The Chinese people are greatly indignant at the shameless behavior of the Indonesian government.

	It is well known that the term "Zhina" was used during the period when Indonesia was under imperialist and colonialist rule to insult the Chinese people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Indonesian people have consistently referred to China by its correct name, the People's Republic of China, and the Indonesian government has also used this correct designation. Now, in order to incite anti-Chinese and racist sentiments, the Indonesian government has resorted to adopting the filthy language of imperialists and colonialists, placing itself in the position of an imperialist lackey. This is a truly pathetic fall!

	The Indonesian people have a glorious anti-imperialist tradition and are close comrades of the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialism. The Indonesian people have suffered long-term oppression and humiliation at the hands of imperialists and have endured various insults. They have waged a heroic struggle to achieve independence and defend the dignity of the Indonesian nation. The Indonesian government's despicable actions against China completely contradict the will of the Indonesian people, damage the honor of the Indonesian people, and will inevitably be condemned and opposed by the Indonesian people.

	We solemnly warn the Indonesian government: the more frantically you engage in anti-Chinese activities, the more you will expose your treacherous nature of betraying the cause of Asian-African solidarity and anti-imperialism, and the more you will reveal your role as an imperialist lackey. There will be no other outcome.

    印尼政府的卑劣行为
    本报评论员
    今年八月底，印度尼西亚陆军副司令庞加贝安，在向内阁主席团主席苏哈托汇报陆军第二次讨论会的结果时，竟然提出要篡改中华人民共和国国名。接着，印尼官方通讯社、广播电台、电视台和报刊纷纷把中华人民共和国的国名恶毒地改为“支那人民共和国”，把中国侨民称为“支那侨民”。印尼政府代理外交部长迪亚，在九月二十日举行的记者招待会上的讲话，和印尼外交部九月二十三日关于中国派船接运受害华侨的声明，也公然使用了同样的字眼。这就充分说明，篡改中国国名是印尼政府主使的。这是对中国人民的莫大侮辱。中国人民对印尼政府这种无耻的行为，表示极大的愤慨。
    众所周知，“支那”一词，是在印尼还受到帝国主义和殖民主义统治时期用来侮辱中国人民的用语。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，印尼人民就一直把中国的国名称为中华人民共和国，印尼政府也一直使用这一正确的称呼。现在，印尼政府为了煽动反华排华的种族主义情绪，不惜抄袭帝国主义者和殖民主义者的这种肮脏语言，把自己摆到帝国主义走卒的地位，这真是堕落到十分可悲的地步！
    印尼人民是具有光荣的反帝传统的人民，是中国人民在反帝斗争中的亲密战友。印尼人民曾经受过帝国主义的长期奴役和欺凌，也遭受过帝国主义者的种种辱骂。他们为了争取独立，捍卫印尼民族的尊严，进行过英勇的斗争。印尼政府对中国的这种卑劣的作法，完全违背了印尼人民的意志，损害了印尼人民的荣誉，势必受到印尼人民的谴责和反对。
    我们严正警告印尼政府，你们越是疯狂地反华，就越要暴露你们背叛亚非团结反帝事业、充当帝国主义走卒的丑恶面目，绝不会有什么别的结果。
