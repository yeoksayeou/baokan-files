From "The Great Ascension to the Hall" to "The Song of the War Horses"

Zhōu Yáng advocates for the creation of so-called "harmless works," claiming that "artworks without political content can also serve politics." This is a poisonous arrow shot by Zhōu Yáng, attempting to use a soft blade to kill people.

I am involved in traditional musical instruments. In the past, I learned some "old relics" from so-called "experts" and performed pieces like the Hebei clapper opera "The Great Ascension to the Hall" and "The Yellow Eagle Spreads Its Wings," which are supposedly "harmless works." The bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" praised these tunes as "refined through countless hammerings," saying they "should be promoted and popularized." However, when performing on the islands, they were opposed by the soldiers.

Once, after a performance, a soldier asked me, "The Hebei clapper opera you played was 'The Great Ascension to the Hall,' right? It's about Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan ascending to the emperor's throne, right?" At that moment, I felt embarrassed and couldn't respond. I could only mumble, "Yeah." A soldier next to him was not so polite and said, "You gave us a negative political lesson."

The soldiers' sharp criticism stirred up a fierce struggle within me. With this question in mind, I studied "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Chairman Mao's words enlightened me. Any artwork carries class characteristics, and people of different classes have different standards and preferences for art. How can a work like "The Great Ascension to the Hall," which praises emperors and generals, be called "harmless"? Zhōu Yáng's advocacy for so-called "harmless works" is peddling capitalist revisionist poison. I decided to use genuine revolutionary works to overthrow those so-called "harmless works."

With the help of leaders and comrades, as well as the specific guidance of professional composers, I finally wrote the draft of the dizi solo "The Song of the War Horses," reflecting the scene of countless troops charging forward. Although this piece is still quite rough and my performance is not very skillful, the soldiers were very satisfied. They said, "The Song of the War Horses" reflects the current spirit of our troops, charging forward with all their might, and it boosts our morale. Later, when performing in a certain city, it was criticized by some so-called "experts" and "authorities." They said, "The Song of the War Horses" has too much battle and not enough song; it's all horse hoof sounds, and you can't hear any music. The same work received two completely different evaluations: "The Great Ascension to the Hall" was liked by "experts" but opposed by soldiers; "The Song of the War Horses" was welcomed by soldiers but opposed by "experts." This shows that the "harmless works" advocated by Zhōu Yáng are actually poison for the bourgeoisie but harmful to workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    从《大登殿》到《战马之歌》
    广州部队海上文化工作队　王从礼
    周扬提倡大搞所谓“无害的作品”，胡说什么“没有政治内容的（文艺作品）也可以为政治服务”。这是周扬放出的毒箭，他企图用软刀子来杀人。
    我是搞民间乐器的，过去在所谓“专家”那里学了一些“老古董”，演奏过河北梆子《大登殿》《黄鹰亮翅》等所谓“无害的作品”。资产阶级的“专家”“权威”们赞扬这些曲子是“经过千锤百炼”的，说“应该发扬光大”，可是下海岛演出，却遭到战士们的反对。
    有一次演出后，一位战士问我：“你演奏的那个河北梆子是《大登殿》吧？就是薛平贵和王宝钏大登皇帝的金銮宝殿吧？”当时我真不好意思，无言答对，只好支吾地回答：“嗯。”旁边一位战士却不客气地说：“你给我们上了一堂反面的政治课。”
    战士的尖锐批评，引起了我激烈的思想斗争。我带着这个问题学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席的话，使我心里豁亮了。任何文艺作品都带有阶级性，不同阶级的人对文艺有不同的标准和不同的爱好。像《大登殿》这样歌颂帝王将相的作品，怎能说是“无害”呢？周扬提倡所谓“无害的作品”，是贩卖资本主义修正主义的黑货。我下决心要用真正革命的作品，去打倒那些所谓“无害的作品”。
    经过领导和同志们的帮助，以及专业作曲工作者的具体指导，我终于写出了反映部队千军万马奔腾形势的笛子独奏曲《战马之歌》的初稿。尽管这支曲子还比较粗糙，演奏也不够熟练，但是战士们听了却非常满意。他们说：《战马之歌》反映了部队当前万马奔腾的精神面貌，鼓舞了斗志。可是后来在某城市演出，却遭到某些所谓“专家”和“权威”的非议。他们说《战马之歌》是“战之有余而歌之不足，满耳朵全是马蹄声，就是听不见音乐。”同一个作品，两种截然不同的评价：《大登殿》“专家”喜欢，战士反对；《战马之歌》战士欢迎，“专家”反对。可见周扬所提倡的“无害的作品”，实际上是对资产阶级有益、对工农兵有害的毒药！
