The PLA resolves to truly master Mao Zedong Thought

	Firmly following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level

The People's Liberation Army is determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Broad masses of officers and soldiers joyfully say that Comrade Lin Biao's call is a great political concern for all cadres and soldiers, a battle cry for leading the entire army to run a good Mao Zedong Thought school, and a guiding light for the entire army to advance along a highly proletarian and highly combatant path.

Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: Comrade Lin Biao recently issued a call to the People's Liberation Army to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, which was immediately met with the most resolute and enthusiastic support and response from all officers and soldiers. They say: Comrade Lin Biao's instruction is too important, too timely. It is a new and great impetus for the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, which is currently being deeply carried out. Officers and soldiers unanimously express that they will spare no effort to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, truly grasp it, and quickly raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the entire army to a new level.

Comrade Lin Biao's call spread like a spring breeze throughout the entire army. Officers and soldiers are all joyful and excited, spreading the news to each other, saying that this is another major joyous event in political life. From the interior to the border, the entire army, upon hearing the news, immediately organized study and discussion. The party committees of the Shenyang, Beijing, Jinan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Air Force, and Engineering Corps units, after seriously studying and discussing, all took effective measures to quickly convey and implement this instruction. The certain unit of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, in order to let Comrade Lin Biao's instruction meet with the broad masses of officers and soldiers as soon as possible, dispatched a work team to remote border units and outposts to convey the instruction. The certain unit of the Kunming forces, which was holding a three-level cadre meeting, upon receiving Comrade Lin Biao's new instruction, had the attending leading cadres study it seriously to understand its spirit, while also calling their respective units to quickly convey this important instruction to the companies. In many companies, the study of Comrade Lin Biao's instruction was carried out with exceptional enthusiasm. Some organized report meetings, some organized propaganda teams, some specially published wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers. Many cultural soldiers also propagated the great significance of this instruction with the greatest political enthusiasm. The naval cultural work team from Guangzhou, which was performing in Beijing, upon hearing this instruction, studied and discussed it through the night and composed the sayings from "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" into songs, propagating and teaching them to the audience in the theater.

Broad masses of officers and soldiers throughout the army unanimously say: Comrade Lin Biao's instruction is a timely rain, a new mobilization order, timely reflecting the strong desire of all officers and soldiers to truly master and grasp Mao Zedong Thought. They say: In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the situation where the entire Party and the entire country's study of Chairman Mao's works has taken on a new situation and new outlook, Comrade Lin Biao has put forward higher requirements for the entire army to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, issuing a mobilization order that shakes the heartstrings. This is a great political concern for the entire army's cadres and soldiers, a battle cry for leading the entire army to run a good Mao Zedong Thought school, and a guiding light for the entire army to study Mao Zedong Thought and advance along a highly proletarian and highly combatant path. A certain platoon leader stationed in the Tibetan Plateau said: "Comrade Lin Biao once again teaches us that Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth of the proletariat tested through long-term revolutionary struggles, the most practical Marxism-Leninism, and the unified action guideline for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country's people. We believe in this correct judgment one hundred percent and unreservedly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, definitely being loyal and loving Chairman Mao without limit, having faith and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought without limit, and being good soldiers of Chairman Mao." The active study members of the Chengdu forces said: "Comrade Lin Biao's instruction is like a bright torch, illuminating our path of studying Chairman Mao's works red and bright." The soldiers of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Railway Engineering Corps expressed that they will definitely follow the path pointed out by Comrade Lin Biao, imprint the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, dissolve it in their blood, and implement it in their actions. The military regions of Shandong, Zhejiang, and the frontline air force units in Fujian are holding conferences for active study members of Chairman Mao's works. After studying, the representatives unanimously reflected: Their minds are clearer, their eyes are brighter, and their momentum to truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought is greater and more sufficient.

Many units in the Navy, Wuhan, Fuzhou, and Xinjiang have, during their studies, compared themselves with Comrade Lin Biao's instruction, summarized past experiences, and found new gaps. They are determined to, according to Comrade Lin Biao's new instruction, definitely grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works more tightly, more concretely, and more broadly, taking "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" as mottos, and working hard on transforming their worldviews, quickly raising the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.
