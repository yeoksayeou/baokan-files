A group of sculptors from Sichuan Province have adhered to Chairman Mao's artistic direction, building on the successful experience of creating the clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard." They ventured into the advanced unit of the country, the Dazhu Commune in Hanshou County, Sichuan Province, and collaborated with the poor and lower-middle peasants to create a large-scale clay sculpture group titled "The New Qu Yuan of the Great Tree." It consists of thirty-three life-sized sculptures, divided into three parts: "Splitting Mountains and Building Dams," "Throwing Stones to Block the Flow," and "Opening Fields and Changing Soil." These parts collectively depict the heroic spirit and deeds of the people of Dazhu in their revolutionary struggle against nature, the land, and water, and enthusiastically praise the heroic figures of the poor and lower-middle peasants who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

"The New Qu Yuan of the Great Tree" is another achievement of Sichuan sculptors serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism under the guidance of Chairman Mao's artistic thought. It has been warmly praised by the broad revolutionary masses.
