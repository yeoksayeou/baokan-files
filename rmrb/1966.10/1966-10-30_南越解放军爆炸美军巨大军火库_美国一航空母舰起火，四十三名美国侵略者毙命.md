The South Vietnamese Liberation Army blew up a massive U.S. ammunition depot near Saigon on the night of the 28th, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

Initial reports indicate that many U.S. aggressor troops were killed or wounded in the blast.

According to reports, the ammunition depot is located in Long Binh, about 18 kilometers northeast of Saigon and just one kilometer away from the U.S. Air Force's important base at Bien Hoa. The depot is surrounded by a brigade of the U.S. 4th Division, as well as a U.S. command headquarters and numerous supply facilities. The depot is responsible for supplying ammunition to the enemy's air and ground forces in the Third Military Region. It stores tens of tons of explosives and various bombs and shells.

Western news agencies reported that the explosion occurred at 9 PM on the 28th, with a deafening roar followed by a giant fireball rising into the sky, and then a series of explosions. The explosions shook the entire city of Saigon, shattering many windows. Even an hour after the explosion, flames and thick smoke could still be seen from Saigon.

After the explosion, chaos reigned in Saigon and the Long Binh area. The U.S. military police in Saigon, terrified, rushed around the city in their cars, desperately trying to locate the site of the explosion.

The U.S. Seventh Fleet's aircraft carrier "Oriskany," which has been conducting war activities off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, suddenly caught fire on the morning of the 26th. The fire killed 43 U.S. aggressors and seriously injured 16 others.

The 42,000-ton aircraft carrier was carrying 70 aircraft.

The Associated Press admitted that the fire "caused massive damage to the aircraft carrier." "This severe damage will render the 'Oriskany' unusable." (Photo attached)

    据报道，这个军火库在西贡东北郊区的隆平，距西贡有十八公里，离美军的重要空军基地边和只有一公里。军火库附近驻有美国第四师的一个旅，还有美军指挥部和许多供应设施。这个军火库负责供应第三军区的敌人空中和地面部队的军火。那里存放着数十吨炸药和各种炸弹和炮弹。
    西方通讯社的消息说，爆炸在二十八日晚上九时发生，一声震天的巨响之后，一个巨大的火球升入天空，接着响起一连串的爆炸声。爆炸声震动了整个西贡，许多窗户都被震坏了。在爆炸一个小时之后，从西贡还可以看到火焰和浓烟。
    爆炸发生后，西贡和隆平地区一片混乱。被吓破了胆的西贡市的美国宪兵慌忙开车在市内疯狂乱转，寻找爆炸发生的地点。
    据新华社讯　西贡消息：在越南民主共和国沿海进行战争活动的美国第七舰队的一艘航空母舰“奥里斯坎尼号”，二十六日早晨突然起火。大火烧死了四十三名美国侵略者，另有十六人受重伤。
