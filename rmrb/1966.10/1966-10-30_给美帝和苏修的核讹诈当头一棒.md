The joyous news reached Daqing, where drums beat and firecrackers exploded, and everywhere the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed. The entire oil field was in a state of excitement.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, the people of Daqing, who have made great achievements in China's socialist construction, enthusiastically hailed the successful test launch of China's missile and nuclear weapons. They resolved to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further strengthen ideological transformation, and make greater contributions to China's socialist revolution and construction, and to support the revolutionary peoples of the world.

When the news reached Daqing, the oil field immediately erupted in a cacophony of drums and firecrackers, with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" echoing everywhere. The entire oil field was in a state of excitement.

The famous "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi, upon hearing the news, excitedly said, "The successful test launch of China's missile and nuclear weapons is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a brilliant achievement of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have mastered missile and nuclear weapons, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary peoples of the world and striking a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries." The Five Good Worker of the Petroleum Industry Department, Xue Guobang, said, "The successful test launch of China's missile and nuclear weapons is a great achievement of the Chinese people turning Mao Zedong Thought, this spiritual atomic bomb, into a material atomic bomb. It is a great material achievement of implementing Comrade Lin Biao's latest instructions and pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage."

When the news reached the famous 1202 Drilling Team's well site, the workers cheered and jumped for joy, unanimously shouting, "Long live our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao!"

When the news reached the home of the famous Five Good Family member Yu Wenlan, she was so happy that she rushed out barefoot, telling everyone to listen to the good news. She joyfully said, "This is a blow to the nuclear blackmail of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. We, the families of Daqing, must study and apply Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, transform our thoughts, set great aspirations, and make the greatest contributions to supporting national construction, supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and supporting the world's revolutionary peoples."
