Chairman Mao is the Teacher of World Revolutionaries
Progressive Students from Various Countries Love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 10th: Progressive students from France and various countries who participated in the International University Student Cultural Festival held in Paris in September expressed their ardent love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to Chinese students.

	An African student studying in France told Chinese students, "The African people love Mao Zedong the most and love New China. Chairman Mao is today's teacher of world revolutionaries. China has become the most eye-catching place in the world. What I need most urgently now is to read more of Chairman Mao's books and understand Mao Zedong Thought."

	He pinned a Chairman Mao badge over the emblem of an African student organization, saying, "This means our organization should carry out activities under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought."

	A Haitian student said: The Haitian people need Mao Zedong Thought to get rid of imperialism and gain true independence and freedom. He said, "We love Mao Zedong. He is the person we are most familiar with." He expressed that upon his return to his country, he would use the books of Chairman Mao he possessed to set up a workers' library, so that the Haitian people could know the truth.

	A student from Suriname (formerly Dutch Guiana) studying in the Netherlands said that he would "arm himself with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, otherwise it would be impossible to participate in the revolutionary struggle to liberate the motherland together with the masses."

	A French university student from Lyon told Chinese students that every time he comes to Paris, he tries to buy a few Chinese publications. He said, "China has become the center of the world revolution. The works of Chairman Mao are not only for the Chinese people to read, but also for the people of the world to read."

	Another French student said, "Although my time is tight, I cannot not read the works of Chairman Mao and Chinese publications. Because China has high held the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and now the center of the world revolution has shifted to China."

	Progressive students from various countries, in their eager pursuit of truth, flocked to Chinese students to request Chairman Mao's works and other Chinese publications. Upon receiving the works of Chairman Mao, they were overjoyed, as if they had obtained a treasure.

    毛主席是世界革命者的导师
    各国进步学生热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想
    据新华社巴黎十日电　参加九月间在巴黎举行的国际大学生文化联欢节的法国和各国进步学生，满怀激情地向中国学生表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的热爱。
    一个非洲留法学生对中国学生说：“非洲人民最热爱毛泽东，热爱新中国。毛主席是今天世界革命者的导师。你们中国成了世界最引人注目的地方。我现在最迫切需要的就是多读毛主席的书，领会毛泽东思想。”
    他把一枚毛主席像纪念章佩在胸前的一个非洲学生组织的徽章之上，他说：“这意味着我们的组织应在毛泽东思想指导之下进行活动。”
    一位海地学生说：海地人民为了摆脱帝国主义，获得真正独立自由，需要毛泽东思想。他说：“我们热爱毛泽东，他是我们最熟悉的人。”他表示，他回国后要用他所拥有的毛主席的书办一个工人图书室，让海地人民知道真理。
    一位在荷兰读书的苏利南（即荷属圭亚那）学生说，他要“用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来武装自己，否则就不可能同群众一起参加解放祖国的革命斗争。”
    一位来自里昂的法国大学生告诉中国学生说，他每次来到巴黎，总要设法买几本中国出版的书刊。他说：“中国成了世界革命的中心。毛主席著作不仅中国人民要读，世界人民也必须读。”
    另一位法国学生说：“我的时间虽然很紧，但不能不读毛主席著作和中国书刊。因为，中国高高举起了马克思列宁主义大旗，现在世界革命的中心已转移到了中国。”
    各国进步学生就是在这种渴望追求真理的心情下，纷纷向中国学生索取毛主席著作和其他中国书刊。他们得到毛主席著作后欣喜若狂，如获至宝。
