In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a shining collective imbued with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought emerged on China's oil front—the 32111 Drilling Team. They diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, internalizing his instructions, embodying them in their actions. In response to Chairman Mao's great call, they forged ahead with self-reliance and arduous struggle, seeking gas and oil, and made tremendous contributions to the socialist construction of our motherland.

On the morning of June 22, 1966, they were performing the final task before the production of a newly drilled gas well—closing the well for pressure testing. Due to the well's exceptionally high gas pressure (nearly double that of nearby old wells), an imported seamless steel pipe burst, immediately igniting a raging inferno that engulfed the well site.

The entire gas field faced imminent destruction. Comrades working at the well site immediately bravely rushed into the flames to battle the blaze. Great Mao Zedong Thought guided their heroic struggle. Deputy team leader and Communist Party member Zhang Yongqing, deputy driller and Young Communist League member Wang Ping, along with apprentices Luo Huatai, Wang Zuming, and Wu Zhongqi, were the first to charge into the inferno. Their sole thought was to extinguish the blaze and save the gas well.

The flames raged back and forth across the well site. The steel derrick collapsed in just three minutes. Zhang Zhongmin, a member of the mine party committee and deputy commander-cum-chief engineer, was severely burned but ignored the pain, determined that in this life-or-death moment, a Communist must advance, not retreat! He persisted in the battle, charging back into the flames. Comrades rushed to pull him out, but he urgently shouted, "Don't mind me, quickly! Quickly! Quickly close the number three valve!"

The fierce flames prevented the warriors from approaching the number three valve. In this critical moment, Deputy Political Instructor Lei Hongbin recalled Chairman Mao's teachings on flexible tactics and strategies, realizing that a frontal assault was futile. If they could open the side valves to divert the gas away from the well site, they could weaken the blaze. Thus, he led a group of comrades towards the number eight valve on the right side of the well site.

Lei Hongbin led the charge to open the number eight valve. Under the scorching flames, he collapsed three times but was each time rescued by comrades. Regaining consciousness, he recalled the golden words of Chairman Mao standing by the well site, instantly finding boundless courage and strength. He stood up and charged back into the inferno.

At the same moment, Deputy Team Leaders Peng Jiashi, Liu Shourong, and Hu Deyin, along with Xu Guangyi and others, spontaneously formed a combat unit to open the number five relief valve on the left side of the well site. Due to the intense flames, several attempts failed. Peng Jiashi and Xu Guangyi grabbed the water hose and charged into the fire, shielding the comrades ahead. The flames and gas blasted them off their feet. They persisted, gaining precious seconds, and finally opened the number five valve.

After opening the number eight and number five relief valves, the flames weakened. The heroes concentrated their efforts on the number three valve. However, the number three valve had warped from the heat, and comrades strained with all their might but couldn't budge it. The roaring flames and choking fumes caused them to collapse repeatedly. But the fire, no matter how fierce, could not extinguish the red spirit of the oil workers' loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, and to the people. The heroes fought on, undaunted.

The heroes fell, then rose again. Apprentice Xu Guangyi seemed to hear Chairman Mao's warm voice: "Little comrade, little comrade, charge ahead!" He bravely rushed back into the fire. Hu Deyin regained consciousness and charged towards the number three valve. He thought: Now is the time when the Party needs me the most. Human life is precious, but the Party's cause is even more so. As long as I can move, I must close you! Every second counts, every turn of the valve adds to the fire-fighting effort!

The number three valve was finally closed, cutting off the gas supply and weakening the blaze. However, the wellhead pressure rapidly increased, posing an imminent risk of explosion. Everyone immediately joined the battle to protect the wellhead. Young Communist League member Wang Youfa was the first to grab a wet blanket and charge towards the flames. Several attempts failed, and he could barely stand. He told himself: You, an orphan of the old society, were raised by the Party. You can sacrifice everything, but you must not sacrifice the Party's interests.

Wang Youfa grabbed another wet blanket and, with all his strength, threw it towards the wellhead, but it was still unsuccessful. At that moment, the great leader Chairman Mao's voice echoed in his ears: "To conquer is everything; to yield is death." The images of heroes like Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun stood before his eyes. He jumped up, shouting, "Burn, burn!" He dove into the flames, covering the wellhead with his body and the blanket.

In the bloody battle against the inferno, miners, families of the drilling team, and nearby commune members all bravely joined the firefighting efforts. Worker's family member Mou Maoxiu was rushing to transport heavy barytes when someone shouted, "Your husband is badly burned, go see him!" She was shaken, but she thought: To struggle is to sacrifice... She quickened her steps and continued the firefighting efforts.

The heroes, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, used their lives and blood to extinguish the raging inferno and protect national property. The injured comrades were quickly sent to the hospital. In their battle against burns, they demonstrated the unyielding will of revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Leaders visiting them said, "We extinguished the great fire with Mao Zedong Thought, and now we will overcome burns with Mao Zedong Thought."

Severely burned Deputy Commander Zhang Zhongmin, upon regaining consciousness, asked for "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When the doctor asked if he was afraid of the pain from the skin graft surgery, he firmly replied: "Oil workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of death, so why fear pain!" The surgery lasted six hours. He drew immense strength from Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly reciting Mao's teachings: "Resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Diesel engine driver Ran Shurong, while extinguishing the fire, repeatedly rushed into the engine room to rescue comrades, sustaining severe injuries. In the hospital, he several times lost consciousness, shouting in his delirium, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He saw eating, taking medicine, and treatment as Chairman Mao's care and tasks for him. He overcame unimaginable physical pain, lying prone for over forty days and nights, striving to recover and return to the battlefield.

The Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the entire nation showed boundless concern for the heroic wounded of the 32111 team. They organized 22 medical units with over 130 medical staff to rush to the scene and provide emergency treatment. The doctors declared, "We are sent by Chairman Mao to save the lives of our class brothers. We will spare no effort to save them."

News of the heroic wounded spread, and the safety of the wounded became the top concern of all workers in the region. Everyone said, "The wounded need as much blood as we can give; the wounded need as much skin as we can donate." Families of the mine workers also rushed to donate blood. Some waited until midnight, refusing to leave without permission. Seventy-year-old family member Mao Zhaolan excitedly said, "My heart is already with the wounded. Please, Party Committee, let me donate blood too!" During these days, tens of thousands of letters and telegrams of concern poured in, expressing the people's boundless care and respect for the heroes.

In this bloody battle against the inferno, the higher Party committee bestowed upon the 32111 team the glorious title of "Proletarian Revolutionary Heroic Drilling Team." They posthumously recognized martyr Communist Party member Zhang Yongqing as an exemplary party member, and Young Communist League members Wang Ping, Luo Huatai, and Wu Zhongqi as formal party members. The higher League committee posthumously recognized martyrs Wang Zuming and Deng Muguang as Young Communist League members. They awarded the firefighting heroes with the glorious titles of "Five Good Workers" and "Five Good Employees" of the Petroleum Industry Department.

The deeds of the 32111 Proletarian Revolutionary Heroic Drilling Team once again prove that when Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes a tremendous material force, creating miracles. Let us hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the heroes' thoughts, walk the heroes' path, and create heroic achievements. Let us carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and march forward bravely on the road of socialist revolution and socialist construction!

    伟大毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌
    ——32111钻井队血战火海抢救气井的英雄事迹
    《工人日报》美术组编绘
    ①在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国石油战线上出现了一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄集体——32111钻井队。他们活学活用毛主席著作，“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”他们响应毛主席的伟大号召，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，找气、找油，为祖国的社会主义建设作出了巨大贡献。
    ②一九六六年六月二十二日凌晨，他们在一口新打的天然气井上，进行投入生产前的最后一项工作——关井测压。由于这口井产量特别大，天然气压力特别高（比附近老井的压力高出近一倍），致使井口旁一根进口的无缝钢管突然憋破，凶猛的气流立即引起一场冲天大火，吞没了井场。
    ③整个大气田面临毁灭的危险。正在井场工作的同志们，立即奋不顾身地与烈火展开搏斗。伟大的毛泽东思想指挥他们英勇战斗。副班长、共产党员张永庆，副司钻、共青团员王平，以及学工罗华太、王祖明、吴仲启等，首先冲进火海。他们只有一个思想：扑灭大火，保住气井。
    ④烈火在井场来回翻滚。钢铁井架三分钟就被烧倒。矿区党委委员、副指挥兼总工程师张仲珉，全身被烧伤，但他忘记剧痛，想到在生死关头，共产党员只能前进，不能后退！他坚持战斗，再次扑向火海。同志们把他抢背出来，他焦急地喊：“莫管我，快！快！快关三号闸门！”
    ⑤烈火凶猛地喷向勇士们，使他们无法靠近三号闸门。副指导员雷洪炳在这紧急关头，想起毛主席关于作战要有机动灵活的战略战术的教导，感到单从正面硬攻不行，如果把左右两侧的放喷闸门打开，把气引出井场，就可以减弱火势。于是他带领一部分同志，向井场右侧的八号闸门冲去。
    ⑥雷洪炳带头抢开八号闸门，在烈火的熏烤下，三次昏倒，都被同志们救了出来。他苏醒以后，想起平日矗立在井场旁的金光闪闪的毛主席语录，顿时感到有了无穷的勇气和力量，猛地挺起身来，又冲进火海。
    ⑦同一时刻，副队长彭家治、刘守荣和胡德炳、徐光益等同志，自动组成一个战斗小组，去开井场左侧的五号放喷闸门。由于火势太猛，冲了几次都没有成功。彭家治和徐光益就抱起水龙带冲进火海，掩护前面的同志。火浪和气流冲得他们站不住脚。他们坚持战斗，赢得了可贵的几秒钟，终于打开了五号闸门。
    ⑧八号、五号放喷闸门打开后，火势减弱了。英雄们集中力量总攻三号闸门。可是三号闸门已被烧得变形了，同志们使尽全身力气也扳不动。熊熊的火焰，呛人的毒气，使他们接连昏倒。但是，火再红，没有石油工人忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于党、忠于人民的思想红。英雄们前赴后继，顽强战斗。
    ⑨英雄们昏倒了，又爬起来。徒工徐光益仿佛听到毛主席亲切的声音：小鬼，小鬼，你冲啊！他又坚强地冲进火场。胡德炳苏醒过来，坚持冲向三号闸门。他想：现在是党最最需要我的时刻。人的生命宝贵，党的事业更宝贵。只要我还能动弹，我就要关住你！多坚持一秒钟，多关一圈，就为灭火多出一分力！
    ⑩三号闸门关住了，切断了气源，火势减弱了。但是，井口压力迅速上升，时刻都有爆炸的危险。大家马上投入保护井口的战斗。共青团员王有发，首先抓起湿被子，扑向火网。几次扑盖，烈火还是挡不住。他已经支持不住了，他对自己讲：你这个旧社会的孤儿，是党把你抚养成人的，自己的一切都能舍弃，就是不能舍弃党的利益。
    ?王有发又抓起一条湿棉被，使尽全身力量，往井口盖去，还是没有成功。这时，伟大领袖毛主席的声音响在他的耳边：要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。黄继光、邱少云等英雄形象也矗立在他的眼前。他一下子跳起身来，高喊：“你烧吧！你烧吧！”连人带被子一起堵住火口。
    ?在血战火海的斗争中，矿区民工团的同志们，钻井队的家属，附近公社的社员，都英勇地参加了灭火战斗。工人家属牟茂修正在抢运重晶石粉，忽然有人喊她：“你爱人被烧坏了，快去看看吧！”她心里一震，但是她想：要奋斗，就会有牺牲……她迈着更快的步伐，坚持投入救火战斗。
    ?英雄们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，用自己的生命和鲜血，扑灭了一场冲天大火，保护了国家的财产。负伤的同志迅速被送进医院。他们在对烧伤作斗争中，表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士的坚强意志。领导同志来看望他们，他们说：“我们扑灭大火靠毛泽东思想，现在战胜烧伤，也要靠毛泽东思想。”
    ?被严重烧伤的副指挥张仲珉，刚苏醒过来，就向护士要《毛主席语录》。医生问他作植皮手术怕不怕痛，他坚定地回答：用毛泽东思想武装起来的石油工人，死都不怕，还怕什么痛！手术进行了六小时。他从毛主席著作中汲取了巨大的力量，不停地默念着毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    ?柴油机司机冉树荣扑灭大火时，多次冲进机房抢救阶级弟兄，身负重伤。来到医院后，他几次休克，在昏迷中不断喊：“毛主席万岁！”他把吃饭、吃药、治伤……都看成是毛主席对他的关怀，给他的任务。他克服了难以想象的肉体痛苦，在床上俯卧了四十多个昼夜，争取早日恢复健康，重返战斗岗位。
    ?党中央、毛主席和全国人民无限关怀32111队的英雄伤员，组织了二十二个医疗单位的一百三十多名医护人员，跋山涉水，争分夺秒，星夜赶到现场投入抢救。医生们表示：“我们是毛主席派来抢救阶级兄弟生命的，决心全力以赴，把阶级兄弟抢救过来。”
    ?救井勇士光荣负伤的消息传布开来，伤员的安危成为全战区职工最关心的大事。人们听说伤员需要输血、植皮，大家都说：“伤员要多少血，我们输多少血；伤员要多少皮，我们献多少皮。”
    ?矿区家属们也自动赶来，一批又一批要求献血。有的守候到晚上十二点，不批准就不走。七十岁的家属毛兆兰激动地说：“我的心早已飞到病人身边，请党委也批准我去献血吧！”在这些日子里，上万封慰问电、慰问信雪片般飞来，表达了广大群众对英雄的无限关怀和崇高敬意。
    ?在这场血战火海的斗争中，上级党委授子32111队以“无产阶级革命英雄主义钻井队”的光荣称号。追认烈士共产党员张永庆为模范共产党员，共青团员王平、罗华太、吴仲启为中共正式党员。上级团委追认烈士王祖明、邓木全为共青团员。授予救火勇士以石油工业部五好标兵、五好职工的光荣称号。
    ?32111无产阶级革命英雄主义钻井队的事迹，再一次证明，毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量，创造出人间奇迹。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，创英雄的业绩，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上，奋勇前进！
