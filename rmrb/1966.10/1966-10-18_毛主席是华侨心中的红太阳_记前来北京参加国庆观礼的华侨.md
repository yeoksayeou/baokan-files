Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in the Hearts of Overseas Chinese
—Recounting Overseas Chinese Who Came to Beijing to Attend the National Day Celebrations

Generations of Overseas Chinese scattered across the five continents, though separated from their motherland by mountains and seas, deeply love Chairman Mao and the socialist motherland, just as the people of the motherland do. A young Overseas Chinese woman from Southeast Asia who came to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations expressed the common sentiment of Overseas Chinese abroad. She said, "We have been waiting for the stars and the moon to see Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We wish Chairman Mao eternal life every day!"

Thousands of Miles Are Nothing

During this year's National Day celebrations, more than a thousand Overseas Chinese from over twenty countries and regions across the five continents came to Beijing to celebrate the holiday with the people of the capital. Many of them overcame numerous difficulties to realize their wish to return to the motherland and see Chairman Mao. Among them, some came from the front lines of the anti-American struggle in Vietnam. Despite the constant bombing by American aggression planes along the way in Vietnam, they were determined to return to the motherland. Some came from Indonesia, where they had to engage in months of struggle with the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia to obtain visas to return to the country. Some Overseas Chinese were servants abroad, and to raise enough money for the trip back, they had worked extra hard for several years. There were also eleven Overseas Chinese from Laos who longed for Chairman Mao day and night and were eager to return. When they decided to set out, they encountered a raging flood. They waded through the floodwaters, trudged through the muddy paths, endured hunger and thirst, and walked for five days before reaching the border of the motherland. No matter how difficult the journey was, or how hungry they were, many people's shoes were worn out. But as long as they thought that with each step they took, they were one step closer to Chairman Mao and Beijing, everyone's hearts were warm, and they were full of energy.

Eager to See Chairman Mao

An elderly Overseas Chinese woman who had worked as a servant abroad for decades returned to the motherland. As soon as she boarded the train to Beijing in Guangzhou, she joyfully exclaimed, "Now we can see Chairman Mao!"

Some Overseas Chinese teachers and students who arrived in Beijing earlier were deeply moved by the great wave of the Cultural Revolution. The news of Chairman Mao receiving revolutionary teachers and students at Tiananmen Square was the most stirring to their hearts. One day, they heard that Chairman Mao was going to receive revolutionary teachers and students again. This group of Overseas Chinese teachers and students, without carefully verifying the news, set out early in the morning towards Tiananmen. They talked as they walked. Someone said:

"Chairman Mao is receiving domestic revolutionary teachers and students. We are not!"

Someone proudly replied, "No, we are also revolutionary teachers and students. We are also coming to Beijing to study Mao Zedong Thought!"

They arrived at Tiananmen Square and waited for a long time before learning that the news about the reception that day was false.

A few days later, the same news was heard again. These Overseas Chinese teachers and students' firm belief in seeing Chairman Mao was not shaken in the slightest. At eight o'clock in the morning, they set out towards Tiananmen again. This time, Chairman Mao was indeed receiving revolutionary teachers and students, and people were surging towards Tiananmen Square from all directions. These Overseas Chinese teachers and students could not enter the square. Just as they were worried, the Red Guards inside the square noticed them. Knowing that they were Overseas Chinese who had traveled thousands of miles to return to the motherland and were also young teachers and students, the Red Guards enthusiastically helped them enter the square and specially arranged for them to be in a position where they could clearly see Chairman Mao.

That afternoon, Chairman Mao appeared on the Tiananmen rostrum to the music of "The East Is Red." The Overseas Chinese youth teachers and students cheered, jumped, and clapped enthusiastically. They were immersed in immense joy.

"The Car of Happiness" Carries Happy People

On October 1st, the Overseas Chinese who came to Beijing for sightseeing were invited to the viewing stand. With hearts full of reverence, they gazed intently at Chairman Mao. One Overseas Chinese held a pair of binoculars and looked at Chairman Mao for several dozen minutes, still reluctant to put them down. The parade, like a surging red tide, passed through Tiananmen to accept Chairman Mao's inspection, which strongly stirred the hearts of every Overseas Chinese.

After the celebration was over, Chairman Mao appeared again on the Tiananmen rostrum amidst the thunderous cheers of tens of thousands of people in the square. Soon, Chairman Mao walked down from the rostrum to the edge of the Golden Water Bridge. At that moment, a group of Overseas Chinese who had just come down from the viewing stand unexpectedly found themselves next to Chairman Mao, so close to him! They cheered, jumped, and shouted themselves hoarse, and clapped their hands until they were sore, but they still could not express their love for the greatest leader, Chairman Mao. At that time, a female Overseas Chinese teacher was short and could not see Chairman Mao, making her very anxious. A soldier next to her noticed this and immediately helped her stand on a stool used by photographers nearby and loudly asked, "Can you see now?" The female teacher was overjoyed and replied, "I can see! I can see!" She repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

After the meeting, the Overseas Chinese returned to the hotel by car, and everyone was so happy they couldn't close their mouths. They discovered that everyone in the car had seen Chairman Mao by the Golden Water Bridge and felt infinitely happy. They named their car the "Car of Happiness." Along the way, the car was full of joy and song, and people continuously sang "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao." Along the way, no matter who they met, the Overseas Chinese enthusiastically waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to greet them. They said passionately, "Comrade! Do you know, we are the happiest people who have seen Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao and the Hearts of Overseas Chinese Are United

The ship sails on the sea with the helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. The Overseas Chinese saw the great leader Chairman Mao, which gave them immense encouragement!

"Seeing Chairman Mao is the great force that propels us forward. We will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will serve the Chinese people and the people of the world for life!" This is the oath of a group of Overseas Chinese youth.

An elderly Overseas Chinese from Indonesia excitedly said with his personal experience, "Overseas Chinese love Chairman Mao, and Overseas Chinese love the motherland. Chairman Mao loves Overseas Chinese the most, and the motherland loves Overseas Chinese the most. Chairman Mao and Overseas Chinese have united hearts. We Indonesian Overseas Chinese are not afraid of anything!"

A female Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia said, "Chairman Mao understands our hearts the most. Abroad, people like me who work for others can only enter high-rise buildings to sweep the floors. Now I not only participated in the National Day celebrations but also saw the most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is truly the reddest red sun in our hearts!"

    毛主席是华侨心中的红太阳
    ——记前来北京参加国庆观礼的华侨
    世世代代侨居海外、遍布五大洲的华侨，虽然同祖国远隔千山万水，但是他们同祖国人民一样，深深地热爱着毛主席，热爱着社会主义祖国。一位来北京参加国庆观礼的东南亚华侨女青年，说出了海外华侨的共同心意。她说：“我们盼星星盼月亮盼着见到毛主席，毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，我们每天都在祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！”
        万水千山只等闲
    今年国庆节期间，有一千多名来自五大洲的二十多个国家和地区的华侨来到北京，同首都人民一起欢度节日。许多人为了实现回祖国见到毛主席的心愿，克服了重重困难。他们当中有的来自抗美斗争最前线的越南，为了回到祖国，他们不顾越南境内沿途美国侵略飞机的轰炸；有的来自印度尼西亚，为了获得回国签证，他们同印度尼西亚右派反动势力进行了好几个月的周旋。有的华侨是在国外做佣工的，为了筹足回国的旅费，他们曾好几年付出了不少额外的劳动。还有来自老挝的十一位华侨，日夜想念毛主席，归心似箭。他们决定启程的时候，碰到洪水猛涨，他们就趟着洪水，踏着泥泞道路，忍饥挨饿，徒步走了五天才到了祖国的边境。不管道路多么难走，肚子多么饥饿，许多人的鞋子都走破了，但他们只要想到再多走一步，就同毛主席、同北京靠近一步时，每个人心里都是热呼呼的，浑身是劲。
        一心想见毛主席
    一位在海外做了几十年佣工的老年华侨妇女，回到祖国后，在广州一登上开往北京的火车，就喜出望外地说：“这下可好了，能见到毛主席了！”
    有些到达北京较早的华侨教师和学生，深深地被无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮激动着。毛主席在天安门接见革命师生的消息，最最强烈地打动着他们的心。有一天，听说毛主席又要接见革命师生，这一群华侨师生来不及仔细打听，一早就结伴来到天安门。他们边走边谈。有人说：
      “毛主席接见的是国内的革命师生，我们不是呀！”
    有人自豪地回答：“不，我们也是革命师生，也是到北京来学习毛泽东思想的！”
    他们来到了天安门广场，等了很久，才知道这天接见的消息是误传了。
    过了几天，又传来了同样的消息。这些华侨师生迫切要求见到毛主席的坚定信念，丝毫也没有动摇。早上八点钟，他们又结伴向天安门进发。这天真的是毛主席接见革命师生，人流从四面八方涌向天安门广场。这些华侨师生进不了广场。正在着急的时候，场内的红卫兵发现了他们，知道他们是万里迢迢从国外归来的侨胞，又是青年师生，就热情地协助他们进入场内，还特地把他们安排在一个能够清楚地看到毛主席的位置上。
    这天下午，毛主席在《东方红》的乐曲声中出现在天安门城楼上。华侨青年师生尽情地欢呼、跳跃、鼓掌。他们沉浸在巨大的欢乐之中。
        “幸福车”载幸福人
    十月一日这天，来京观光的华侨应邀登上了观礼台。他们怀着万分崇敬的心情，目不转睛地凝视着毛主席。有一个侨胞举着望远镜仰望毛主席，一连看了几十分钟，还舍不得放下。游行队伍像汹涌澎湃的红色海浪，通过天安门接受毛主席检阅的情景，强烈地激荡着每一个侨胞的心。
    庆祝大会宣布结束后，毛主席又在整个广场几十万人雷鸣般的欢呼声中，出现在天安门城楼上。不一会，毛主席走下城楼，来到金水桥边。这时，一批从观礼台上下来的侨胞意外地发现，他们竟走到了毛主席的身边，和毛主席靠得这样近！他们欢呼啊，跳跃啊，喊哑了嗓子，拍痛了手掌，也表达不尽对最伟大的领袖毛主席的热爱。当时，有一位华侨女教师因为个子矮，看不见毛主席，急得什么似的。她身旁一位解放军同志发现了，立刻帮助她站在附近摄影师用的凳子上，大声问道：“看到了没有？”女教师高兴万分地回答：“看到了！看到了！”她不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    散会以后，侨胞们乘汽车回旅馆时，人人高兴得合不拢嘴。他们发现，原来整个车里的人，全都在金水桥畔看到了毛主席，人人都感到无限幸福。他们把自己乘坐的车子命名为“幸福车”。一路上，满车欢乐满车歌，人们不断高唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》等歌曲。一路上，无论见到谁，侨胞们都热情地挥舞《毛主席语录》，向他们致意。他们豪情满怀地说：“同志！你可知道，我们都是见到毛主席的最最幸福的人！”
        毛主席和华侨心连心
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。华侨同胞见到了伟大领袖毛主席，给他们多么巨大的鼓舞力量啊！
      “见到了毛主席，这是推动我们前进的伟大力量。我们要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，一辈子为中国人民、世界人民服务！”这是一群华侨青年的誓言。
    一位印度尼西亚老华侨，以他的切身体会激动地说：“华侨热爱毛主席，华侨热爱祖国。毛主席最爱护华侨，祖国最爱护华侨。毛主席和华侨心连心，我们印尼华侨什么也不怕！”
    来自东南亚的一位华侨妇女说：“毛主席最了解我们华侨的心。在海外，像我这样给人家做工的人，就是能够进入高楼大厦，也只有扫地的份。现在我不但参加了国庆观礼，还见到了最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，毛主席真是我们心中最红最红的红太阳！”　新华社通讯员
