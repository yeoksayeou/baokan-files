Editors' Note: Take root along the border, and let your hearts bloom like sunflowers. The soldiers guarding the frontier of Tibet think of our great leader Chairman Mao day and night. Chairman Mao's sunshine illuminates their hearts. They are not afraid of the cold of the snowy mountains, nor the dangers of the highland roads. They bear heavy responsibilities and stand firm on their glorious posts. The soldiers long to wear Chairman Mao's portrait badges on their chests so they can see him day and night!

On October 12th, our newspaper published a letter expressing the soldiers' wishes. Soon after, Red Guards and revolutionary masses from all over the country sent letters filled with revolutionary passion and many shining Chairman Mao portrait badges, as well as Red Guard armbands, red scarves, and Chairman Mao's quotations badges. They said, "Quickly send these to the most beloved soldiers. Let the border guards wear them first." They said, "Badges, fly quickly!"

These are not ordinary letters and gifts. They are hearts sent to the soldiers guarding the roof of the world. Across thousands of miles, badges are sent, and hearts are connected. From Tibet to Beijing, to every corner of the country, the hearts of hundreds of millions of people beat together for Chairman Mao. From the five lakes and four seas, from north to south, revolutionary youth and masses care deeply about our border guards. They want to join the border guards in using Mao Zedong Thought to illuminate their minds; they want to follow Chairman Mao in revolution forever; they want to defend Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao with their lives, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. With proletarian revolutionary feelings, they hope to share their happiness with the soldiers and let the border guards wear Chairman Mao's portrait badges on their chests.

We have selected a few of these letters to publish. Everyone should read them and draw new strength from them. Let us inspire and learn from each other, care for each other, and promote each other on the revolutionary path. Together, let us march forward under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Let the Badges Inspire Us to Move Forward

Most Beloved People—Border Guards:

You guard the frontier of Tibet, and you have worked hard! We, the Red Guards and revolutionary youth, greet you and extend our warmest regards and highest revolutionary salute to you!

Seeing the letter expressing your wishes deeply moved us. You guard the frontier of Tibet, looking towards Beijing, and your hearts are always with Chairman Mao!

You hold your rifles tightly, standing alert in the icy snow, standing proudly on the roof of the world, protecting the safety of our people, and protecting the Party Central Committee and our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! When we work and study, you stand on the ice-covered mountains with your assault rifles; when we rest, you are sharpening your knives and cleaning your guns, ready to strike back at any invaders!

You are the most beloved sons of the motherland! You bear the people's trust, brave like Huang Jiguang, and selfless like Lei Feng. We are determined to be like you, forever the strong revolutionary successors, forever the Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao!

Most beloved soldiers, from your letters, we see your boundless love for Chairman Mao. You have only one Chairman Mao portrait badge, which you wear during duty; you gather around the badge every day to study Chairman Mao's works.... We are deeply moved by your strong class feelings. Wearing the Chairman Mao portrait badge on your chest is like living by Chairman Mao's side, feeling endless happiness, closeness, and warmth. We have decided to send you the Chairman Mao portrait badges and Chairman Mao's quotations badges we received in Beijing, expressing our deepest respect.

Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, the guiding light of world revolution. Wear the Chairman Mao portrait badge and patrol! Wear it and fight! It will give you endless wisdom and strength.

We solemnly promise you: We will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and march forward bravely!

专栏：

    编者的话：扎根边防线，心开向阳花。守卫在西藏边疆的战士们，日日夜夜想念着我们伟大的领袖毛主席。毛主席的阳光照亮了他们的心。他们不怕雪山风寒，不怕高原路险，肩负重任，坚守在光荣的岗位上。战士们多么想在胸前戴上毛主席像纪念章，好日日夜夜看到毛主席啊！
    本报十月十二日刊登表达战士们这种愿望的信以后，各地的红卫兵和革命群众很快就寄来了一封封充满火热的革命激情的信，寄来了许多金光闪闪的毛主席像纪念章，还有红卫兵袖章、红领巾、毛主席语录章等礼物。他们说，快把这些转送给最可爱的战士，让边防战士先戴上。他们说，纪念章，快飞吧！
    这不是一些平常的信和礼品，这是送往守卫在世界屋脊上的边防战士的一颗颗红心。迢迢万里赠送纪念章，隔山隔水心连心。从西藏到北京，到全国各地，亿万人民的红心共同向着毛主席。五湖四海，地北天南，革命小将、革命群众都十分关心我们的边防战士，要和边防战士一起，用毛泽东思想把自己的思想照得通红通红；要和边防战士一起，跟着毛主席永远干革命；要和边防战士一起，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们怀着无产阶级的革命深情，希望把自己的幸福和战士分享，让边防战士胸前戴上毛主席像纪念章。
    我们选载其中几封来信，大家读一读，一定会从中汲取新的力量。让我们在革命的道路上互相鼓舞、互相学习、互相关怀、互相促进，共同在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下阔步前进！
    让纪念章鼓舞我们前进最可爱的人——边防战士：
    你们守卫在祖国的西藏边疆，你们辛苦了！我们红卫兵战士、革命小将向你们问好，向你们致以最热烈的问候，致以最崇高的革命敬礼！
    看到表达你们愿望的信，深受感动。你们守卫在祖国的西藏边疆，眼望着北京城，心里时刻想念着毛主席！
    你们紧握枪杆，警惕地坚守在冰天雪地里，傲然挺立在世界屋脊上，保卫着祖国人民的安全，保卫着党中央和我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！当我们工作和学习的时候，你们正挎着冲锋枪站立在滴水成冰的雪山上；当我们休息的时候，你们正在磨刀和擦枪，准备痛击来犯的侵略者！
    你们是祖国人民最可爱的子弟兵！你们肩负着人民的嘱托，像黄继光一样勇敢，像雷锋一样甘做人民的勤务员。我们决心像你们那样，永远做坚强的革命后代，永远做毛主席的红小兵！
    最可爱的战士们，从你们的信里，我们看到你们无限热爱毛主席的红心。你们只有一枚毛主席像纪念章，执勤的时候戴上它；你们每天围在纪念章周围学习毛主席著作。……我们被你们这种强烈的阶级感情深深感动了。胸前戴上毛主席像纪念章，就会像生活在毛主席身边一样，觉得无限幸福，无比亲切，无比温暖。我们决定把在北京得到的毛主席像纪念章和领到的毛主席语录章赠送给你们，表示我们的一片敬意。
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，是世界革命的指路明灯。你们戴上毛主席像纪念章去巡逻吧！戴上它去战斗吧！它会给你们无穷的智慧和力量。
    我们最坚决地向你们保证：永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进！
