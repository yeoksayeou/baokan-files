	Workers sing "The East is Red"
	The workers of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Machinery Repair Factory study Chairman Mao's quotations before work and then go to the workshop. Walking on the road, they sing "The East is Red." The sun is in my heart! Remembering Chairman Mao's words, the hammer swings with boundless strength. I dare to create miracles, I dare to overcome difficulties. The news of production success shines in the sky! Striving to be even stronger, with great aspirations surging, the world is within my sight, and the five continents are in my heart. The responsibility of the world revolution is heavy! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fiercely attacking and surging forward, smashing the old world, sweeping away the harmful insects. Forever keep the country red for ten thousand generations! The earth shakes but I do not shake, the ground quakes but I do not move, carrying the great red flag, the revolutionary spirit never relaxes. Forever follow Chairman Mao!

    工人高唱《东方红》
    武汉冶金建筑机械修造厂工人　陶世绵班前学“语录”，学罢去上工。走在大路上，高唱《东方红》。太阳就在我心中！牢记毛主席的话，挥锤力无穷。奇迹我敢创，难关我敢攻。生产捷报照天红！奋发又图强，志壮豪情涌，四海收眼底，五洲记在胸。世界革命责任重！文化大革命，猛打又猛冲，砸碎旧世界，横扫害人虫。永保江山万代红！山摇我不摇，地动我不动，肩扛大红旗，革命劲不松。永远跟着毛泽东！
