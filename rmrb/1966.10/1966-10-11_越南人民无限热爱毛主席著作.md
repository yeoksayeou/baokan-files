Many Vietnamese comrades say: Chairman Mao's books are a summary of Marxist-Leninist theory and the revolutionary experiences of the peoples of the world. The more one studies and understands them, the more one comprehends the principles involved. When encountering problems in work, one studies Chairman Mao's works, and upon studying, finds solutions.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the Vietnamese people have an unbounded love for Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's works have been widely circulated throughout Vietnam. According to an official from the Vietnam Central Book and Periodical Distribution Company, many of Chairman Mao's works are in high demand, and due to the requests of a wide readership, they have had to be reprinted multiple times. For example, "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" have been reprinted seven or eight times by July of this year.

Many Vietnamese comrades say that they love reading Chairman Mao's books because Chairman Mao's works are classic Marxist-Leninist works, rich in content and easy to understand. A secretary of a provincial committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party excitedly told a reporter: he is currently rereading Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." He said that he has always insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, and the more he studies, the deeper his understanding and the more principles he comprehends. He said: "Whenever I encounter problems in my work, I study Chairman Mao's works, and upon studying, I find solutions." A colonel from the People's Army said that from the war against the French to the war against the Americans, he has always insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, especially Chairman Mao's military works. He said: "Chairman Mao's series of discussions on the people's army, people's war, and how imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers are all extremely brilliant and correct." A teacher from Peace Province, when talking about his insights from studying Chairman Mao's works, said: "Chairman Mao's works are 'priceless treasures.' Anyone who wants to truly understand Marxism-Leninism must study Chairman Mao's works." A veteran worker from the famous Thai Nguyen Steel Plant told the reporter that he loves reading Chairman Mao's books because "Chairman Mao's books are a summary of Marxist-Leninist theory and the revolutionary experiences of the peoples of the world." A common member of an agricultural cooperative from South River Province poured out his boundless love for Chairman Mao's works to the reporter, saying: "When I obtained a set of Chairman Mao's works, it was like obtaining an extremely precious treasure."

The heroic Vietnamese military and civilians, with their personal experiences of defeating American imperialism, enthusiastically praise the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and the theory that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They say: the great victory of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression for national salvation is also a great victory of Chairman Mao's people's war thought. A brigade commander of the People's Army who has experienced countless battles told the reporter: "We in the South Liberation Army use Chairman Mao's military thoughts and tactical principles, fight close-quarter battles, fight night battles, concentrate forces to fight annihilation battles, and have defeated the modernized American invading army. In the North, we implement nationwide air defense and have shot down over 1,400 American aggressor planes with inferior weapons. This makes us deeply feel that Chairman Mao's great military thought is invincible."

To meet the needs of the broad masses of the Vietnamese people, this year the "Truth Publishing House" in Vietnam reprinted Chairman Mao's philosophical masterpieces "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" in Vietnamese.

    越南人民无限热爱毛主席著作
    许多越南同志说：毛主席的书是马克思列宁主义理论和世界各国人民革命经验的总结；越学体会就越深，懂得的道理就越多；在工作中碰到问题时，就学习毛主席著作，一学习，就有了解决办法。
    据新华社河内电　越南人民无限热爱毛主席著作。毛主席著作已经广泛地流传到越南各地。据越南中央书刊发行公司负责人的介绍，许多毛主席著作往往供不应求，在广大读者的要求下，不得不连续再版。如《矛盾论》和《实践论》，到今年七月份为止，就再版了七、八次。
    许多越南同志说：他们非常喜欢读毛主席的书，因为毛主席的著作是马克思列宁主义的经典著作，内容很丰富，而且通俗易懂。一位越南劳动党省委书记兴奋地告诉记者：他现在正在重读毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》和《湖南农民运动考察报告》等著作。他说，他过去就经常坚持学习毛主席著作，越学体会就越深，懂的道理就越多。他说：“每当我在工作中碰到问题的时候，我就学习毛主席著作，一学习，办法就有了。”人民军的一位上校说，从抗法战争到抗美战争，他一直坚持学习毛主席著作，特别是毛主席的军事著作。他说：“毛主席关于人民军队、人民战争以及帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎等一系列的论述，都是无比英明和正确的。”和平省的一位教师在谈到他学习毛主席著作的心得时说：“毛主席著作是‘无价之宝’，谁要想真正懂得马克思列宁主义，谁就得学习毛主席著作。”著名的太原钢铁厂中的一位老工人向记者说，他很爱读毛主席的书。因为“毛主席的书是马克思列宁主义理论和世界各国人民革命经验的总结。”南河省一位普通的农业社社员向记者倾吐他对毛主席著作无限热爱的心情时说：我得到一套毛主席著作，就好像得到无比珍贵的宝物。
    英雄的越南军民特别以他们亲身打败美帝国主义的战斗经历，热烈赞扬毛主席关于人民战争思想、帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断的英明和正确。他们说：越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，也是毛主席人民战争思想的伟大胜利。一位身经百战的人民军团长对记者说：“我们南方解放军运用毛主席的军事思想和战术原则，打近战，打夜战，集中力量打歼灭战，战胜了现代化装备的美国侵略军。在北方，我们实行全民防空，用劣势武器打落了一千四百多架美国强盗飞机。这使我们更深深体会到毛主席的伟大军事思想是战无不胜的。”（附图片）
