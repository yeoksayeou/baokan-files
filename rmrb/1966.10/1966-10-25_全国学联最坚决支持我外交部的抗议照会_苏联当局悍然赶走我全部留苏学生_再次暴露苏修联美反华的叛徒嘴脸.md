The All-China Students' Federation today issued a statement saying that Chinese students strongly support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' October 22 protest note to the Soviet Embassy in China, and strongly condemn the Soviet government's unilateral decision to suspend Chinese students in the Soviet Union and force them to leave the country within a specified time. This is another serious incident in the recent wave of frenzied anti-China activities launched by the Soviet leadership worldwide, further deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations.

The statement points out that the Soviet authorities have consistently violated the Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation agreement, disrupted exchanges between Chinese and Soviet students, and subjected Chinese students to various forms of harassment. In 1965, the Soviet government, in opposition to Chinese students in the Soviet Union participating in rallies supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression, brutally suppressed Chinese and Vietnamese students, a bloody crime that is still fresh in our memory. Today, the Soviet authorities have once again expelled all Chinese students from the Soviet Union, further exposing the hypocrisy of the Soviet leadership's claims of anti-imperialist "united action" and revealing their role as accomplices of U.S. imperialism, conspiring with the U.S. against China. We must warn the Soviet leadership: Your despicable actions will be met with opposition from revolutionary students and people in the Soviet Union and around the world, and you will not get away with it. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the long run, only promote more extensive and more violent revolutions among the people." The Soviet government's anti-China actions will also meet with utter failure.

The statement says that at present, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the people and students of our country are engaged in an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great struggle to uproot the roots of revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, firmly planting the roots of Mao Zedong Thought among all the people and youth of China. It will inevitably arouse the deep hatred of U.S. imperialism, the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and all reactionaries. They are beside themselves with fury, doing everything in their power to slander, distort, incite, fabricate lies, and defame our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, as Chairman Mao teaches: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unstoppable. The howls of the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet leadership, and all reactionaries cannot conceal their inner fear. Let all these monsters tremble before our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, before the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought! The Chinese people and students will stride forward triumphantly on the path indicated by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

    全国学联最坚决支持我外交部的抗议照会
    苏联当局悍然赶走我全部留苏学生
    再次暴露苏修联美反华的叛徒嘴脸
    新华社二十四日讯  中华全国学生联合会今天发表声明说，中国学生最坚决地支持我国外交部十月二十二日给苏联驻华大使馆的照会，最强烈地抗议苏联政府片面决定中国在苏联的全部留学生休学并限期离开苏联的无理行径。这是苏联领导最近在全世界掀起疯狂反华运动中，又一恶化中苏关系的严重事件。
    声明指出，苏联当局破坏中苏文化合作协定，破坏中苏两国学生之间的交流，对中国留学生进行百般刁难是一贯的。一九六五年苏联政府为反对中国留苏学生参加支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的游行，野蛮镇压中国和越南等国留学生的血腥罪行对我们记忆犹新。今天苏联当局又悍然把全部中国留苏学生赶回国，只能再一次戳穿苏联领导集团叫嚷反帝“联合行动”的假象，再一次暴露他们充当美帝帮凶、联美反华的叛徒嘴脸。我们要正告苏联领导：你们的这种恶劣行径必将遭到苏联和全世界革命学生和人民的反对，是决不会有好下场的。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。苏联政府的这一反华行动也必将遭到彻底失败。
    声明说，目前，我国人民和学生在我们伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，正进行着一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这是一场挖掉修正主义根子、防止资本主义复辟、进一步巩固无产阶级专政，在全中国人民和青年中牢牢扎下毛泽东思想根子的伟大斗争。它必然地会引起美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和一切反动派的刻骨仇恨。他们歇斯底里大发作，对我们这场无产阶级文化大革命极尽污蔑、歪曲、挑拨、造谣、诽谤之能事。但是，正如毛主席教导的：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。我国这场无产阶级文化大革命的影响是无法阻挡的。以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派的狂吠绝对掩盖不了他们内心的恐惧。让这一切牛鬼蛇神在我们的无产阶级文化大革命面前，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民面前发抖吧！中国人民和学生将昂首阔步朝着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席所指引的道路胜利前进！
