The various ethnic groups of Zhenfeng County in Guizhou Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, through self-reliance, have built rural small-scale power stations, achieving remarkable success. After three years of effort, this county has now completed the construction of seventy-seven small power stations. The construction of these power stations has greatly improved the appearance of this backward mountainous region. Many places have begun to use electric power for husking rice, grinding flour, sawing wood, and irrigating farmland. Eighty percent of the communes in the entire county have power stations, and more than one-third of the commune members have installed electric lights in their homes.

    从江自力更生建设电站
    贵州从江县各族人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自力更生地建设农村小型电站，获得了很大成就。经过三年的努力，现在，这个县已建成小型电站七十七座。这些电站的兴建，使这个生产落后的山区面貌大大改观。许多地方都开始用电力来碾米、磨面、锯木和灌溉农田。全县百分之八十的公社有了电站，三分之一以上的社员家里装上了电灯。
