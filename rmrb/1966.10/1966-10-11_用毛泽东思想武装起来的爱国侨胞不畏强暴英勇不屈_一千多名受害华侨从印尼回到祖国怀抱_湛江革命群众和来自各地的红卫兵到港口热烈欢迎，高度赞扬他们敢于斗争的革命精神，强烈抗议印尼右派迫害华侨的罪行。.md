More than a thousand overseas Chinese who suffered persecution in Indonesia returned to the embrace of their motherland. Revolutionary masses of Zhanjiang and Red Guards from various parts of the country warmly welcomed them at the port, highly praising their revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle, and strongly protesting against the crimes of the Indonesian rightists in persecuting overseas Chinese.

A thousand and six patriotic overseas Chinese who suffered brutal persecution in Indonesia arrived at Zhanjiang Port aboard the Guanghua ship this morning. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary youth, and Red Guards from all over the country warmly welcomed these sons and daughters of the Chinese nation who fearlessly resisted and remained unyielding in the face of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces back to the great socialist motherland.

Under the bright sunlight, Zhanjiang Port today was a sea of red flags and a sea of Chairman Mao's quotations. Revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed everywhere. The ships anchored at the port hoisted colorful signal flags. Buildings and tall gantry cranes near the pier were adorned with huge red banners reading, "Sending warm greetings to the overseas Chinese who suffered persecution in Indonesia" and "Strongly protesting against the persecution of overseas Chinese by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces." From the pier to the exit road, more than four thousand workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary youth, and Red Guards held up portraits of Chairman Mao, Mao's quotations, and large red welcome signs, dancing and singing under the morning sun to warmly welcome the returning persecuted overseas Chinese.

At 8:20 AM, the ships anchored at the port blew their horns, and the Guanghua ship, flying the five-star red flag and displaying a large portrait of Chairman Mao, slowly approached the pier. The patriotic overseas Chinese and heroic sailors stood in rows on the deck. The pier immediately resounded with music and cheers. The loudspeakers continuously broadcasted welcome speeches, expressing respect and greetings to the patriotic overseas Chinese and the heroic sailors of the Guanghua ship. People held up the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waving flowers and red flags, cheering and jumping, shouting, "Welcome! Welcome!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The overseas Chinese and sailors on the ship raised portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and excitedly waving to their compatriots on shore. Many people were so moved that they had tears in their eyes, repeatedly shouting, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" The ship and the pier were filled with songs, cheers, slogans, and firecracker sounds that echoed through the sky.

Under the solemn melody of "The East Is Red," the overseas Chinese who had upheld the glorious patriotic tradition and maintained national dignity in the face of brutal persecution by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces stepped onto the pier one by one. Among those returning this time, many originally resided in various places in the Aceh region of Indonesia, such as Simalungun, Lhokseumawe, Medan, Kuala Lumpur, Sigli, and Blangkejeren. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the firm support of the 700 million people of the motherland, they fearlessly resisted, united as one, and fought bravely against the persecution by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. Many overseas Chinese in Simalungun pasted the five-star red flag on their doors a few days before they were forced to leave their homes. The right-wing thugs used intimidation, beatings, and other barbaric methods to try to tear down the five-star red flag. To maintain the dignity of the motherland, the patriotic overseas Chinese fought face-to-face with the right-wing thugs, who were protected by Indonesian armed police, until they left their homes, and the solemn five-star red flag remained on their doors. After being driven to the cotton plantation "temporary shelter" in Medan, they, together with overseas Chinese from other places, fought bravely against the provocations of Indonesian military police and American spies. Lin Yixin, the vice chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the vice chairman of the Commission for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, who specially came to welcome the persecuted overseas Chinese, shook hands with Zhang Guichang, who had actively organized the patriotic overseas Chinese in Simalungun to fight bravely, and praised them for fighting well and being worthy sons and daughters of the great Chinese nation. Overseas Chinese Luo Luozhen had organized overseas Chinese in the Medan "shelter" for the displaced to fight against the extortion and harassment of Indonesian officials. Today, he led his family ashore with a sense of victory and told the welcoming crowd, "The Chinese people are not to be bullied. Fighting with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon can defeat all enemies!"

The patriotic overseas Chinese received a warm welcome from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards at the pier. Liu Lianying's husband was brutally killed by Indonesian right-wing fascist thugs, and all the property in her home was looted, but she managed to preserve the revolutionary treasure—Chairman Mao's works. Today, she held up Chairman Mao's works, and her son held up Chairman Mao's portrait as the whole family of seven stepped off the Guanghua ship. Lin Yixin and other leaders went forward to express their warm welcome. Learning from Mao Zedong's works enthusiast, Yangchun Overseas Chinese Farm worker, and Indonesian returnee He Guizhen, Liang Qihao, knowing her experience, pushed forward from the crowd and gave Liu Lianying's family a portrait of Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao's works, and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" wrapped in red paper, hoping that they would read Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and join the revolution and construction with the revolutionary people of the whole country. Persecuted overseas Chinese Wang Suying's family loves Chairman Mao and actively studies Chairman Mao's works. A Red Guard from Beijing specially gave her a commemorative badge he obtained during his visit to Chairman Mao's hometown Shaoshan. When Wang Suying received this precious gift, she was so moved that she repeatedly shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Many of the overseas Chinese returning this time had their bodies severely damaged under the inhuman persecution of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. When the medical team and the stretcher squad composed of Red Guards carried them one by one ashore, the masses expressed great indignation towards the Indonesian reactionaries. The crowd shouted, "Strongly protesting against the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in persecuting overseas Chinese!"

A group of overseas Chinese youth, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, Mao's quotations, and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," marched down the gangway with high spirits. The Red Guards immediately rushed forward to shake hands with them and cheer warmly. The overseas Chinese youth who had returned victorious from the frontline of international class struggle and the Red Guards who had established great merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution met in victory. The fighting camaraderie made them so excited that their eyes were filled with tears. Many Red Guards took off the Mao badges from their chests and pinned them on the chests of the overseas Chinese youth. The Red Guards said, "We warmly hail your victory in struggle and warmly welcome your return to the motherland to join the revolutionary and construction work of socialism with the people of the whole country." The overseas Chinese youth expressed their determination to study Mao Zedong Thought and learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, actively participating in the revolutionary and construction work of socialism in the motherland.

Today, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, teachers, students, and Red Guards in Zhanjiang City also warmly welcomed the heroic crew members of the Guanghua ship who, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcame all difficulties and completed the mission entrusted by the people of the motherland, successfully returning the first batch of persecuted overseas Chinese.

At the Zhanjiang Port pier, welcoming the patriotic overseas Chinese and heroic sailors were also Peng Deqing, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications, and leaders of the Party and government of Guangdong Province, Zhanjiang Prefecture, and Zhanjiang City, including Zhao Zoyun, Huang Jie, Mo Huai, and Wang Youlin.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国侨胞不畏强暴英勇不屈
    一千多名受害华侨从印尼回到祖国怀抱
    湛江革命群众和来自各地的红卫兵到港口热烈欢迎，高度赞扬他们敢于斗争的革命精神，强烈抗议印尼右派迫害华侨的罪行。
    新华社湛江十日电　一千零六名在印度尼西亚遭受残酷迫害的爱国侨胞，乘光华轮于今天上午回到湛江港。湛江市广大工农兵群众、革命青少年和来自全国各地的红卫兵，在港口码头上热烈欢迎这些在印度尼西亚右派反动势力面前不畏强暴、英勇不屈的中华民族的好儿女回到伟大的社会主义祖国。
    阳光普照的湛江港，今天是一片红旗的海洋和毛主席语录的海洋。到处响彻《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》的革命歌声。在港口停泊的轮船，升起了五光十色的信号旗。码头附近的建筑物和高大的龙门式起重机上，挂着鲜红夺目的巨幅标语，上面写着：“向在印度尼西亚受迫害的侨胞致以最亲切的慰问”、“强烈抗议印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨”。从码头到出口的大道上，四千多名工农兵群众、革命青少年和红卫兵，高举毛主席像、毛主席语录牌和大红的欢迎标语牌，迎着朝阳，载歌载舞地热烈欢迎受害侨胞胜利归来。
    八时二十分，停泊在港口的轮船汽笛长鸣，飘扬着五星红旗、高悬着毛主席巨幅画像的光华轮徐徐靠近码头。爱国侨胞和英雄海员们一排排地站立在甲板上。码头上顿时鼓乐齐鸣，欢声雷动。广播器里不断播送着欢迎词，向爱国侨胞和光华轮的英雄海员们表示敬意和慰问。人们举着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，挥舞着花束和红旗，欢呼着、跳跃着，高呼：“欢迎！欢迎！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”船上的侨胞和海员们一个个高举毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，激动地向祖国亲人招手。许多人激动得热泪盈眶，不断高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”轮船上、码头上，歌声、欢呼声、口号声、鞭炮声响彻云霄。
    在庄严的《东方红》乐曲声中，发扬了光荣的爱国传统，在印度尼西亚右派反动势力的残酷迫害面前坚持了民族气节的侨胞们，陆续走上码头。这次回国的侨胞，有许多原来侨居在印度尼西亚亚齐地区的司马委、鹿树昆、美伦、瓜拉新邦、西吉利、打京岸等地。他们在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的感召下，在祖国七亿人民的坚决支援下，不畏强暴，团结一致，曾同印度尼西亚右派反动势力的迫害行为进行了英勇的斗争。司马委的许多华侨在被迫离开住地的前几天，还在自己的房门口贴上了五星红旗。右派暴徒们对他们采取了恐吓、毒打等野蛮手段，企图撕下五星红旗。爱国侨胞为维护祖国尊严，同在印度尼西亚武装军警掩护下的右派暴徒进行了面对面的斗争，直到他们离开自己的住地，庄严的五星红旗依然贴在家门口。他们被赶到集中营式的棉兰“临时收容所”以后，同其他地方的受害侨胞一起，又向印度尼西亚军警和美国特务的挑衅活动进行了英勇的斗争。专程前来迎接受害侨胞的华侨事务委员会副主任、接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员林一心，同曾积极组织司马委爱国华侨进行英勇斗争的章贵昌紧紧握手，赞扬他们斗得好，不愧为伟大中华民族的好儿女。华侨罗鹿珍曾在棉兰浮罗吧烟的难侨“收容所”里，组织侨胞同印度尼西亚官员的勒索、刁难行为进行了针锋相对的斗争，今天他带着胜利的激情，领着一家大小走上岸来，他对欢迎群众说：“中国人民不可侮。以毛泽东思想为武器进行斗争，可以战胜一切敌人！”
    爱国华侨们在码头上受到了广大工农兵和红卫兵的热烈欢迎。难侨刘莲瑛的丈夫惨遭印度尼西亚右派法西斯暴徒杀害，家中的财物也被抢掠一空，但她千方百计把革命的宝书——毛主席著作保存了下来。今天她捧着毛主席著作，她的儿子高举着毛主席像，全家七口走下光华轮时，林一心等负责人走上前去向他们表示热烈欢迎。学习毛主席著作积极分子、阳春华侨林场职工、印度尼西亚归侨何桂珍、梁齐好得知她的经历后，从人群里挤上前去，把用红纸包着的毛主席像、毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》送给刘莲瑛全家，希望他们好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，和全国革命人民一起闹革命，搞建设。受害侨胞王素英全家热爱毛主席，积极学习毛主席著作，来自北京的一名红卫兵特地把自己参观毛主席家乡韶山时得到的一枚纪念章送给她。王素英接过这件珍贵的礼物时，激动地连声高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    这次归国的许多华侨，在印度尼西亚右派反动势力惨无人道的迫害下，身体受到严重摧残。当医务人员和红卫兵组成的担架队把他们一个个用担架抬上岸来的时候，广大群众对印度尼西亚反动派表现了无比的愤慨。人群中响起了“坚决抗议印度尼西亚反动派迫害华侨的滔天罪行”的怒吼声。
    一队华侨青少年，高举着毛主席像、毛主席语录牌和《毛主席语录》，唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，斗志昂扬地走下船梯。红卫兵们立即围上前去同他们紧紧握手，热烈欢呼。从国际阶级斗争前线胜利归来的青少年爱国侨胞，和在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了伟大功勋的红卫兵战士胜利会师了。战斗的情谊使他们激动得满眼泪花。许多红卫兵取下自己胸前的毛主席像纪念章，佩在青少年爱国侨胞的胸前。红卫兵们说，我们最热烈地欢呼你们斗争的胜利，最热烈地欢迎你们回到祖国，和全国人民一起，参加祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。华侨青少年们表示，要努力学习毛泽东思想，学习红卫兵的革命精神，积极投身到祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中去。
    今天，湛江市的广大工农兵、革命干部、革命师生和红卫兵，还热烈欢迎光华轮的英雄船员们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，排除万难，完成了祖国人民的重托，接运首批受害华侨胜利返航。
    在湛江港码头欢迎爱国侨胞和英雄海员的，还有交通部副部长彭德清，广东省和湛江专区、湛江市党、政府的负责人赵卓云、黄洁、莫怀、王友林等。（附图片）
