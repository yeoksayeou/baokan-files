They Stand with Us in Battle
—Foreign Friends in Beijing Warmly Support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

In the midst of the new high tide of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is shaking the world, many foreign experts who have come to Beijing to help with China's construction have enthusiastically praised this great revolution and actively supported it. They have shown their boundless revolutionary fervor to challenge the old world alongside the Chinese people.

The revolutionary actions of friends from all five continents have given the Chinese workers in their units one internationalist education after another, and have also made us more deeply aware of the great global significance of China's Cultural Revolution.

Offering a Red Heart of a Proletarian Revolutionary

Let us first read some excerpts from the revolutionary big-character posters written by some foreign friends!

—The more than 50-year-old British friend, Chapman, has been working in China for 17 years. After the Cultural Revolution began, he stayed up two nights in a row, writing two open letters full of revolutionary fervor to his Chinese colleagues, raising many questions worth pondering, and offering his red heart as a proletarian revolutionary:

"As a Communist, my life is closely linked with my work in China.... 'Struggle is life!' I eagerly hope to participate in the struggle of life for the sake of the proletarian cause and to do my part in the struggle."

"We are determined to do our best to raise our children to be good proletarian revolutionaries, to be good children of the Mao Zedong era. We ourselves must also change our thoughts and habits and play our due role in the Cultural Revolution...."

—The Belgian friend, Qiu Hengli, and his wife Monique, who came to work in China last year, simultaneously posted two revolutionary big-character posters. They proposed a series of revolutionary initiatives, voluntarily requesting to live like Chinese workers and hoping to organize themselves to participate in physical labor among China's workers and peasants. After their big-character posters were posted, Chinese colleagues in their unit rushed to copy them, and many people cried tears of excitement as they copied. The two Belgian friends wrote:

"We do not want to be outsiders, but want to fight alongside you, all the Chinese revolutionaries, and all the revolutionaries of the world, for the victory of communism, for the elimination of imperialism and reactionaries, and for the elimination of all systems of human exploitation!"

"We did not come to China for money, but to help the Chinese people. Money can only corrupt those who possess it."

Let Mao Zedong's Voice Spread Rapidly Around the World

—The American friend, Irene, the French friend, Shanal, and two other Belgian friends, Barry and Allete, expressed in a joint big-character poster their determination to advance side by side with Chinese comrades in the Cultural Revolution, and their boundless love and faith in Mao Zedong Thought:

"We come from all over the world. We are determined: (1) to work harder to reform ourselves, promote our revolutionization, and establish a proletarian worldview; (2) for this, we must systematically study Mao Zedong Thought and strive to apply it actively; (3) we must take a political command attitude towards the work assigned to us.... To defeat our common enemy—American imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and to achieve the victory of Mao Zedong Thought around the world, we must fight alongside the Chinese people!"

Such revolutionary big-character posters can be copied many times. After reading the big-character posters of foreign friends, can we not feel a surge of internationalist spirit coursing through us?!

Many foreign friends, while posting revolutionary big-character posters and proposing revolutionary initiatives, have hung framed portraits of Chairman Mao in their offices and dormitories, with Mao's quotations they have copied themselves next to the portraits. Some have voluntarily organized Mao Zedong Thought study groups, reading regularly and discussing periodically. They say: "Mao Zedong's works are the truth guiding the world revolution. We must read them every day and follow them every word." Some foreign friends have proposed naming the building they live in "Norman Bethune Building" to express their desire to become internationalist warriors like Norman Bethune. They have written "For the Revolution" in large letters on their typewriters and work harder than ever. Some foreign friends, in their spare time, stay up all night writing articles to introduce the great significance and victorious situation of China's Cultural Revolution to their compatriots; some stay up late translating Mao Zedong's works, preparing to send the manuscripts back home for publication. They say: "We want to let the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao spread rapidly around the world!"

Why do friends from various countries show such high revolutionary fervor in China's Cultural Revolution? Recently, reporters, through contact with many foreign experts, have gained a deeper understanding from their passionate and unrestrained conversations.

With a Revolutionary China, the Whole World Has Hope

A friend from an Asian country said: "China's Cultural Revolution is a major historical event related to the fate of the whole world. With China's ever-red revolutionary banner, the revolution of the whole world has hope!"

An African friend said: "China's Cultural Revolution is a great innovation in world history. Its victorious progress has indisputably declared to the revolutionary people of the world that people must carry out this great revolution in the ideological realm to maintain their revolutionary youth forever."

A Latin American friend said: "China's Cultural Revolution is the greatest, deepest, and most thorough revolution. After this great revolution, China, the center and base of the world revolution, will be even stronger and will more powerfully support the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world."

When the reporter visited the office of the Italian expert, Mario Dinozzi, this Italian friend, full of deep emotion, looked up at the portrait of Chairman Mao that he had personally hung on the wall, pointing to the Mao quotations he had written himself on both sides, and excitedly told the reporter: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by the great leader Chairman Mao is the best guarantee for China to build socialism successfully and transition to communism. In this great revolution, the old world is being thoroughly buried, and a new world is flourishing. A new generation of proletarians is being fostered. Whether for China or for the whole world, the Cultural Revolution has great historical significance."

Red Guards Will Forever Shine in the Red Universe of the Proletariat

In Beijing, many international friends, like all revolutionaries around the world, regard New China, illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, as the hope of all the people of the world. For this reason, they not only care about China's present but also about China's future. They have given high praise to the vanguard role of revolutionary youth and the emergence of revolutionary youth organizations like the Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution.

The Yemeni friend, Salah Dahhan, is a poet. On the day before the Red Guards in the capital took to the streets to sweep away the "Four Olds," he was deeply moved by the revolutionary spirit of the young guards and could not contain his excitement, writing a poem that day to praise the Red Guards. He wrote: "The young guards of China, the students of Mao Zedong! You are defending the red tomorrow, defending the glorious cause of the Party, defending the great eastern world of workers, peasants, and soldiers of Mao Zedong's China!"

The Brazilian friend, Martins, although not a poet, used poetic language to praise that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is fostering a new generation, fostering millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. He told the reporter: "For the billions of new heroes who will appear in the world, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the stars in the sky seem too few. These new heroes will shine like stars forever in the red universe of the proletariat!"

China Has Become a Fortress and Base of the World Revolution

Friends from Oceania, New Zealand's Reek, and North America, the American Epstein, also highly evaluated the revolutionary spirit of China's Red Guards and youth. Reek said: "The emergence of the Red Guards and their revolutionary actions not only mean that socialism will be more consolidated in this generation in China, but also mean that the proletarian rule in China will never change color. Revolutionary people around the world who oppose American imperialism will receive greater support from this world revolutionary base in China." Epstein pointed out: "The revolutionary youth of China have never been as spirited as they are today. They have revolutionary enthusiasm and are guided by Mao Zedong Thought. They have the revolution of China and the whole world in their hearts. They have only one standard to distinguish right from wrong, which is Mao Zedong Thought, the interests of the proletariat, the revolution of China, and the revolution of the world."

Dear reader comrades, here, let us introduce another moving activity organized by some foreign experts in Beijing themselves, a Mao Zedong Thought study group. The members of this group, while studying Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," visited the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum four times to better grasp Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war, and then discussed many times in connection with their study and visit. That day, the reporter visited a member of the study group, the Ceylonese friend, Kandasamy. Kandasamy, dressed in a plain khaki Zhongshan suit, wore a Chairman Mao badge on his chest. When he talked to the reporter about the great significance of Chairman Mao initiating the Cultural Revolution and the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, he was full of enthusiasm and eloquent.

He said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest revolutionary, and the greatest genius. Chairman Mao is the great leader and commander of the world revolution. He summed up the experience of the Chinese and the entire international communist movement, proposed the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, initiated the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and thus fundamentally guaranteed that China would become an unbreakable fortress and base of the world revolution from the root."

He also said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism and the guiding star of the world revolution. In the current Cultural Revolution, China is becoming a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The oppressed nations and peoples of the world have seen the great role that Mao Zedong Thought has played in the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and have increasingly believed without doubt: only Mao Zedong Thought can lead the world proletarian revolution to victory!"

The World Revolution Cannot Do Without the Great Helmsman Chairman Mao

The Nigerien friend from fighting Africa, Hamidu, repeatedly told the reporter in Chinese during the reporter's visit: "Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman!" "Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman!" He also recited the lyrics of the song "Navigating the Great Sea Relies on the Helmsman" in Chinese to the reporter, pointing out that not only China's Cultural Revolution and the entire socialist revolution and socialist construction cannot do without the great helmsman Chairman Mao, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, but the entire world revolution also cannot do without the great helmsman Chairman Mao to steer the course, needing the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought to illuminate.

Hamidu now studies Mao Zedong's works every day and can recite many of Mao's profound quotations. He told the reporter that he and many African friends felt very familiar after reading Mao's works, and everyone felt that although Mao had not been to Africa, it was as if he had personally gone to Africa, because Mao's discussions on many issues were very relevant to the situation in Africa. This African friend told the reporter in a very sincere tone: "We are very, very grateful to the great leader Chairman Mao because he has given the revolutionary people of the world the most effective and powerful ideological weapon."

"Mao Zedong Thought is the highest directive of the Chinese revolution and also the highest directive of the world revolution. After this Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought will shine even more brightly, illuminating the path of the revolutionary people of the world! This is the greatest happiness and the greatest news for the revolutionary people of the world." The international friends the reporter has contacted have all, with the greatest enthusiasm and the most beautiful language, praised the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought to us, pointing out that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of power for achieving all victories.

"Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" This voice is echoing endlessly around the world.

    他们和我们并肩战斗
    ——在京外国朋友热情支持我国文化大革命
    在震撼世界的我国无产阶级文化大革命新高潮中，许多在北京帮助我国建设的外国专家，热情地赞颂这场伟大的革命，积极地支持这场伟大的革命，表现了要同中国人民并肩向旧世界挑战的无限革命激情。
    来自世界五大洲各国朋友们的革命行动，使得他们所在单位的中国职工，受到了一次又一次生动的国际主义教育，也使得我们更深刻地体会到了我国文化大革命的伟大世界意义。
    献出一颗无产阶级革命者的红心
    现在，让我们先读一读一些外国朋友写下的革命大字报的片断吧！
    ——今年五十多岁的英国朋友夏庇若，到中国工作已经十七年了。文化大革命开始以后，他两次深夜不眠，奋笔疾书，给所在单位中国同志写了两封充满革命激情的公开信，提出了许多值得人们深思的问题，也献出了他一颗无产阶级革命者的赤心：
    “作为一个共产党人，我的一生是和我在中国的工作紧密联结在一起的。……‘斗争就是生活！’我迫切希望为了无产阶级事业的利益参加到生活的斗争中去，并在斗争中做我的一份工作。”
    “我们决心尽我们的所能，使我们的孩子成长为好的无产阶级革命者，成为毛泽东时代的好孩子。我们自己也要改换思想和习惯，在文化革命中起我们应起的作用。……”
    ——去年刚到中国工作的比利时朋友丘恒力和他的夫人莫尼克，同时贴出了两张革命的大字报。他们提出了一系列革命倡议，主动要求和中国工作人员过一样的生活，希望经常组织他们到我国工农群众中去参加体力劳动。他们的大字报贴出以后，所在单位的中国同志争相传抄，许多人边抄边流下了激动的热泪。两位比利时朋友写道：
    “我们不愿做一个局外人，而要像你们所有的人一样，同中国革命同志和全世界革命同志斗争在一起，为共产主义的胜利，为消灭帝国主义和反动派，为消灭所有人剥削人的制度而奋斗！”
      “我们不是为了钱来中国的，而是为了帮助中国人民来的。钱只能使占有它的人腐化。”
    让毛主席的声音迅速传遍全世界
    ——美国朋友艾琳，法国朋友沙纳尔和另外两位比利时朋友巴里、阿莱特，在联合写的一张大字报上，表达了他们要和中国同志在文化大革命中并肩前进的决心，表达了他们对毛泽东思想的无限热爱和无限信仰：
    “我们来自世界各地。我们决心：（一）更加努力改造我们自己，促进我们革命化，树立无产阶级世界观；（二）为此，我们要系统地学习毛泽东思想，力求做到活学活用；（三）以政治挂帅的态度来对待分配给我们的工作。……为了战胜我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，为了毛泽东思想在全世界取得胜利，我们要和中国人民并肩作战！”
    这样的革命大字报还可以转抄很多。当我们读了外国朋友的这些大字报以后，能不感到有一股股国际主义精神的暖流激荡着自己吗？！
    许多外国朋友，在贴出革命大字报和提出革命倡议的同时，有的在办公室和宿舍里挂起了镶着镜框的毛主席像，在毛主席像旁贴着他们自己抄下的毛主席语录。有的自动组织起毛主席著作学习小组，每天按时阅读，定期讨论。他们说：“毛主席著作是指导世界革命的真理，我们要天天读，句句听。”有的外国朋友，倡议把他们住的一幢大楼命名为“白求恩大楼”，表示他们都要成为白求恩式的国际主义战士。他们在自己工作用的打字机上写下了“为革命”三个大字，工作得比任何时候更加勤奋。有的外国朋友在工作之余，彻夜赶写文章，向本国人民介绍中国文化大革命的伟大意义和胜利形势；有的深夜伏在灯下赶译毛主席著作，准备把译稿寄回国内出版。他们说：“我们要让伟大领袖毛主席的声音，迅速传遍全世界！”
    为什么各国朋友在我国文化大革命中会迸发出如此高昂的革命激情？最近记者在同许多外国专家的接触中，从他们热情奔放的谈吐中，一次比一次得到了更深刻的了解。
    有了革命的中国整个世界就有了希望
    一位来自亚洲国家的朋友说：“中国文化大革命是关系到整个世界命运的重大历史事件。有了中国这一面永远鲜红的革命大旗，整个世界的革命就有了希望了！”
    一位非洲朋友说：“中国文化大革命是世界历史上的伟大创举。它的胜利进展已经无可辩驳地向全世界革命人民宣告，人们要想永葆革命的青春，必须进行这一场意识形态领域内的伟大革命。”
    一位拉丁美洲朋友说：“中国文化大革命是一场最伟大、最深刻、最彻底的革命。经过这场大革命，中国这个世界革命的中心和根据地必将更加强大，必将更加有力地支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的革命运动。”
    当记者来到意大利专家马恩利奥·迪努齐的办公室访问他时，这位意大利朋友满怀深情，仰望着他亲手挂在墙壁上的毛主席像，手指着两旁他自己抄写的毛主席语录，激动地对记者说：“由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是中国胜利建成社会主义和过渡到共产主义的最好保证。在这场伟大的革命中，旧世界正在被彻底埋葬，新世界正在蓬勃发展，无产阶级的一代新人正在被造就出来。无论是对中国还是对全世界，文化大革命都有着巨大的历史意义。”
    红卫兵永远在红色宇宙中闪烁光辉
    在北京的许多国际友人和全世界所有革命者一样，都把毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的新中国看作是全世界人民的希望。正因为这样，他们既关心中国的今天，更关心中国的明天。他们对于文化大革命中革命青少年的急先锋作用和红卫兵等革命青少年组织的出现，给予了极高的评价。
    也门朋友萨利赫·达汉是一位诗人。在首都红卫兵上街横扫“四旧”的头一天，他被小将们的革命精神深深地感染着，激情难以抑制，当天就写了一首诗，赞颂红卫兵。他写道：中国的小将们，毛泽东的学生们！你们捍卫着红色的明天，捍卫着光荣的党的事业，捍卫着毛泽东中国的伟大东方的工农兵世界！
    巴西朋友马尔丁斯虽然不是诗人，也用诗一般的语言，赞颂中国文化大革命正在造就着一代新人，造就着千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。他对记者说：“对于世界上将要出现的亿万个用毛泽东思想武装起来的新型英雄来说，天穹中的星星也显得为数太少了。这些新型的英雄人物，将像星星一样永远在无产阶级的红色宇宙中闪烁光辉”！
    中国已成为世界革命的堡垒和基地
    来自大洋洲的新西兰朋友雷克和来自北美洲的美国朋友爱泼斯坦，他们同样高度评价了中国红卫兵和青少年的革命精神。雷克说：“红卫兵的出现和他们的革命行动，不仅意味着社会主义将在中国的这一代更加巩固，而且意味着中国无产阶级的江山将永不变色。全世界反对美帝国主义的革命人民，将从中国这块世界革命根据地得到更大的支援。”爱泼斯坦指出：“中国革命的青少年从来没有像今天这样意气风发。他们既有革命的热情，又有毛泽东思想作指导。他们心中装着中国革命和整个世界革命。他们心中只有一个分辨是非的标准，这就是毛泽东思想，就是无产阶级的利益、中国革命和世界革命的利益。”
    亲爱的读者同志们，在这里，让我们再介绍一个由部分在京外国专家自己组织的毛主席著作学习小组的感人活动。这个小组的成员，在学习林彪同志的文章《人民战争胜利万岁》的时候，为了更好地掌握毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想，曾前后到中国人民革命军事博物馆参观了四十次，然后结合学习和参观讨论了不知道多少次。那天，记者去访问了这个学习小组的成员、锡兰朋友康德萨密。康德萨密身穿一套朴素的卡叽布中山装，胸前佩带着毛主席像纪念章，当他向记者谈到毛主席发动文化大革命的伟大意义和毛泽东思想的无穷威力的时候，热情洋溢，滔滔不绝。
    他说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，最伟大的革命者和最伟大的天才。毛主席是世界革命的伟大领袖和统帅。他总结了中国和整个国际共产主义运动的经验，提出了关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，发动了当前的无产阶级文化大革命，从而从根本上保证中国成为世界革命的牢不可破的堡垒和基地。”
    他还说：“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是世界革命的指路明星。在当前文化大革命中，中国正在成为毛泽东思想的大学校。全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民，看到了毛泽东思想在中国人民革命事业中所发挥的伟大作用，已经越来越深信不疑：只有毛泽东思想能够引导世界无产阶级革命走向胜利！”
    世界革命离不开伟大的舵手毛主席
    来自战斗着的非洲的尼日尔朋友哈米杜，在记者访问他时，一再用中国话对记者重复地说：“大海航行靠舵手！”“大海航行靠舵手！”他还用中国话复述歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》中的歌词，向记者指出，不仅中国文化大革命和整个社会主义革命、社会主义建设离不开伟大的舵手毛主席，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，而且整个世界革命也离不开伟大的舵手毛主席掌握航向，需要毛泽东思想的光辉照耀。
    哈米杜现在每天都坚持学习毛主席著作，能够背诵毛主席的许多精辟语录。他告诉记者，他和许多非洲朋友读了毛主席的著作以后，都感到十分亲切，大家觉得毛主席虽然没有到过非洲，但是就好像他亲自去过非洲一样，因为毛主席论述的许多问题都非常切合非洲的情况。这位非洲朋友以极其真挚的语调对记者说：“我们非常非常感激伟大的领袖毛主席，因为他给了全世界革命人民最有效、最强大的思想武器。”
    “毛泽东思想是中国革命的最高指针，也是世界革命的最高指针。经过这场文化大革命，毛泽东思想将更加光芒四射，照耀着全世界革命人民前进的道路！这是全世界革命人民的最大幸福和最大喜讯。”记者接触过的国际友人，都以最大的热情，最美好的语言，向我们赞颂伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，指出毛泽东思想是取得一切胜利的力量源泉。
    “伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”这个声音正在全世界到处引起循环不绝的回响。
