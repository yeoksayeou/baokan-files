		Most beloved Chairman Mao, comrades, students, and friends:

		On this brilliant and glorious National Day, amidst the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we—revolutionary students from all over the country—have gathered in the capital, united around our great leader and dearest comrade, Chairman Mao. This is an unforgettable moment of supreme happiness for us.

		Chairman Mao! You are the brightest red sun in our hearts. We think of you every day and long for you every day! Today, we have finally seen this day and realized our wish!

		Beloved Chairman Mao! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which you personally initiated and led, is like a surging river and towering waves, rolling forward with each wave higher than the last. Chairman Mao! Following you, we raise high the banner of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, charge into battle, and advance bravely. We launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois ideology, old customs, and old habits, and thoroughly defeat the counter-revolutionary revisionists, the bourgeois rightists, and the bourgeois reactionary authorities, making them lose all their prestige and never able to rise again! Workers, peasants, and soldiers support us, and the revolutionary people support us. The revolutionary situation is excellent!

		"The ship sails with the helmsman, everything grows with the sun, dew nourishes the seedlings, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our path forward. We will forever raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strictly implement the Sixteen Points, and grasp the direction of the struggle. We dare to make revolution and are good at making revolution; we dare to fight and are good at fighting. We will be at the forefront in the great storms of revolution, fight at the forefront, humbly learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and unite with them to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

		Chairman Mao! You have told us that the future of China belongs to us, and the future of the world belongs to us! We must definitely become the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The great cause opened up by the revolutionary forerunners must be built into an ironclad fortress in our hands; with our hearts devoted to the motherland and our eyes on the world, we will carry the struggle to advance the world revolution to the end! Even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble, our red hearts will never change!

		We warn imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries: your illusions have been shattered! The new generation of New China has sterner bones and redder hearts. You foolishly hope to pin your hopes for peaceful evolution on our third and fourth generations—this is a pipe dream!

		On this day of national celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we pledge to you: We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. We vow to be critics of the old world and creators of the new world. We will sweep away all the mud and filth left by the old world and create a radiant new world of Mao Zedong Thought. Together with all the revolutionary people of China and all the revolutionary people of the world, we will raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and let it fly forever!

		Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
		Long live the Communist Party of China!
		Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
		Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our great leader Chairman Mao!

    毛主席啊！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。我们天天想啊！日日盼！我们终于盼到了这一天，实现了我们的心愿！
    敬爱的毛主席啊！由您亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，就像大河水，长江浪，汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前，一浪高过一浪。毛主席啊！我们跟着您，高举无产阶级革命造反的大旗，冲锋陷阵，勇往直前，向资产阶级意识形态、旧风俗、旧习惯势力，展开猛烈的进攻！要把反革命修正主义分子，把资产阶级右派分子，把资产阶级反动权威，彻底打倒，打垮，使他们威风扫地，永世不得翻身！工农兵支持我们，革命的人民支持我们，革命的形势好得很！
    “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想”。毛泽东思想照亮着我们前进的道路。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，不折不扣地贯彻执行十六条，掌握斗争的大方向。敢于革命，善于革命；敢于斗争，善于斗争。我们要在革命的大风大浪中冲在前，打在前，虚心向工农兵学习，和工农兵团结一致，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席啊！您老人家告诉我们，中国的前途是属于我们的，世界的前途是属于我们的！我们一定要成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。革命先辈开创的基业，要在我们手里建成铁打的江山；胸怀祖国，放眼世界，要把推进世界革命事业的斗争进行到底！海枯石烂，我们的红心永不变！
    正告帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，你们的幻想破灭了！新中国的新一代骨头更硬，心更红。你们妄想把和平演变的希望寄托在我们第三代、第四代身上，这是白日作梦！
    在这举国欢庆中华人民共和国成立十七周年的今天，我们要向您宣誓：我们要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民。我们誓做旧世界的批判者，新世界的创造者。我们要荡涤旧世界遗留下来的一切污泥浊水，要创造出一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。我们要同全中国革命人民一起，同全世界革命人民一起，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
