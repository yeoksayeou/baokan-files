The All-China Journalists Association has issued a statement announcing that it will not attend the Sixth Congress of the International Federation of Journalists. The statement, excerpted below, reads as follows:

Under the control and manipulation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the International Federation of Journalists held an executive committee meeting in the city of Trebic in South Moravia, Czechoslovakia, from September 22 to 23, and will convene its Sixth Congress in Berlin from October 10 to 15. The purpose of these two meetings is to further promote the line of capitulationism and splitism of the Soviet revisionist leadership, to serve the interests of American imperialism, and to harm the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the world's people. The All-China Journalists Association solemnly declares: We firmly oppose and condemn the capitulationist and splitist activities of certain leaders of the International Federation of Journalists, and we resolutely will not send our delegation to attend these two meetings.

For a long time, the International Federation of Journalists, under the control and manipulation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, has betrayed the will and wishes of the vast majority of progressive journalists around the world to unite against imperialism. It has degenerated into a shameful tool for promoting the line of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world." It has extensively advocated the entire set of revisionist lines of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful transition," and "peaceful competition" of the Soviet leadership, and has striven to beautify American imperialism, attempting to stifle the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

On the Vietnam issue, certain leaders of the International Federation of Journalists have closely collaborated with the Soviet revisionist leadership in playing the trick of fake support and real betrayal. Everyone knows that the Soviet revisionist leadership has long been the number one accomplice of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. The actions of certain leaders of the International Federation of Journalists are entirely in accordance with the intentions of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

It must also be pointed out that just before this executive committee meeting, the General Secretary of the International Federation of Journalists, Masner, maliciously slandered the consistent and just stance of the Chinese people in firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. In an article, he maliciously said that "China's position on the Vietnam issue is very complicated." This is obviously intended to direct the spearhead at China and cover up the dirty political dealings between the Soviet Union and the United States.

To implement the line of capitulation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, certain leaders of the International Federation of Journalists have bowed and scraped to beg for cooperation with the "International Federation of Journalists" controlled by American imperialism, repeatedly pleading for the "consultative" status of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, a tool of American imperialism. On the other hand, they actively undermine the fighting unity of progressive journalists in various countries, using all kinds of despicable tricks such as striking, expelling, deceiving, and inciting, to carry out shameful splitist activities among journalists' organizations in various countries. They have spared no effort in attacking and destroying the Asian-African Journalists Association, which has raised the banner of anti-imperialist revolution.

Certain leaders of the International Federation of Journalists regard China as the biggest obstacle to their capitulationist and betrayal activities, as a thorn in their side, and therefore use every opportunity to attack and slander China. They not only engage in anti-China conspiracies everywhere but also openly publish vicious articles and pictures attacking the All-China Journalists Association and the Chinese people in the journal of the International Federation of Journalists. Their hysterical anti-China actions are obviously in line with the needs of American imperialism and are a shameful betrayal.

Regarding the line of capitulation and splitism promoted by certain leaders of the International Federation of Journalists, the All-China Journalists Association and many other member organizations have repeatedly expressed opinions and criticisms. However, they have not changed their ways but have instead gone further and further down the path of betrayal and splitism. They have done countless bad things behind the backs of progressive journalists around the world and the All-China Journalists Association. Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership and its followers are using the Sixth Congress of the International Federation of Journalists to further intensify their evil activities of fake anti-imperialism, true capitulation, fake support, true betrayal, fake unity, and true splitism. Before the meeting, they have sent people to engage in activities to sabotage the unity of progressive journalists in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and to incite anti-China sentiments. Regarding the preparations for this executive committee meeting and congress, the Secretariat of the International Federation of Journalists has imposed a strict blockade on the All-China Journalists Association, and even the main documents to be submitted to the congress, such as the General Secretary's report, have not been sent to us. This is a very undemocratic and abnormal evil practice.

Given the above circumstances, the All-China Journalists Association, of course, cannot send its delegation to attend this executive committee meeting and the Sixth Congress of the International Federation of Journalists. We believe that progressive journalists around the world must thoroughly expose the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership using the International Federation of Journalists to promote its line of capitulation and splitism, must draw a clear line of demarcation with them, and must not engage in any "joint actions" with them. We must establish the broadest international united front against American imperialism and its lackeys. This united front must not include the Soviet revisionist leadership, which is the number one accomplice of American imperialism. On the contrary, they should be the target of struggle in the international anti-American united front.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. But having only this kind of army is not enough. We must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." We progressive journalists are an important component of this cultural army. Chinese journalists are willing to work together with progressive journalists around the world to use our pens as powerful weapons to unite the people, educate the people, strike at the enemy, and annihilate the enemy. We firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries in the world, and fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. We are not afraid of any risks and are willing to pay any heavy price until we completely, thoroughly, and cleanly drive the American aggressors out of Vietnam and achieve final victory.

Chairman Mao Zedong said: "People of the world, unite! Let us all strive for the victory of the cause of the world's people! All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." All progressive journalists around the world, let us unite, join forces with all anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist people in the world, and carry on the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys to the end. Let us carry on the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership to the end, and push the revolutionary cause of the world's people forward.

    我记协发表声明宣布不出席国际记协第六次代表大会
    揭露苏修利用国际记协进行投降分裂活动
    号召全世界进步新闻工作者加强团结把反帝反修斗争进行到底
    据新华社六日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会发表声明，宣布不出席国际新闻工作者协会第六次代表大会。声明摘要如下：
    在苏联修正主义领导集团操纵和控制下的国际新闻工作者协会，于今年九月二十二日到二十三日，在捷克斯洛伐克的南捷克州特累蓬城召开了执委会，并将于十月十日到十五日在柏林召开第六次代表大会。国际新闻工作者协会召开这两次会议，目的是为了进一步推行苏联修正主义领导集团的投降主义和分裂主义路线，为美帝国主义效劳，危害世界人民的反帝革命事业。中华全国新闻工作者协会郑重宣布：我们坚决反对和谴责国际新闻工作者协会某些领导人的投降和分裂活动，并且坚决不派自己的代表团出席国际新闻工作者协会的这两次会议。
    长期以来，国际新闻工作者协会在苏联修正主义领导集团控制和操纵下，违背全世界广大进步新闻工作者团结反帝的意志和愿望，堕落成了推行“美苏合作主宰世界”投降主义路线的一个可耻的工具。它大肆鼓吹苏联领导集团的“和平共处”、“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”等一整套修正主义路线，并竭力美化美帝国主义，妄图扼杀亚、非、拉人民的革命斗争。
    在越南问题上，国际新闻工作者协会某些领导人紧密配合苏联修正主义领导集团玩弄假支持、真出卖的勾当。谁都知道，苏联修正主义领导集团早已成为美帝国主义侵略越南的头号帮凶。国际新闻工作者协会某些领导人完全是按照苏联修正主义领导集团的意旨行事的。
    这里还必须指出，就在这次执委会开会之前，国际新闻工作者协会总书记麦斯纳竟然对中国人民一贯坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争的正义立场，进行恶毒的诽谤。他在一篇文章中别有用心地胡说什么在越南问题上“中国的立场是十分复杂的”。这显然是为了把矛头指向中国，掩盖苏美进行肮脏的政治交易。
    为了贯彻苏联修正主义领导集团的投降路线，国际新闻工作者协会的某些领导人，卑躬屈膝地哀求同美帝国主义控制的“国际新闻工作者联合会”合作，再三地乞求取得美帝国主义的工具——联合国教科文组织的“谘询”地位。另一方面，他们积极破坏各国进步新闻工作者的战斗团结，使用打击排挤、欺骗拉拢、挑拨离间等种种卑劣伎俩，在各国记者组织间进行可耻的分裂活动。他们对高举反帝革命旗帜的亚非新闻工作者协会，更是不遗余力地加以攻击和进行破坏。
    国际新闻工作者协会的某些领导人，把中国看成是进行投降叛卖活动的最大障碍，是他们的眼中钉、肉中刺，因而利用一切场合，对中国进行攻击和诬蔑。他们不仅到处进行反华阴谋活动，而且公然在国际新闻工作者协会的会刊上，发表恶毒攻击中华全国新闻工作者协会和中国人民的文章和图片。他们这样歇斯底里地进行反华，显然是适应美帝国主义的需要，是一种可耻的背叛。
    对于国际新闻工作者协会某些领导人推行的这一整套投降分裂路线，中华全国新闻工作者协会和其他许多会员组织曾经多次提出意见和批评。然而他们却毫不悔改，相反，在叛卖和分裂的道路上越走越远。他们背着全世界进步新闻工作者和中华全国新闻工作者协会干出了无数的坏事。现在，苏联修正主义领导集团及其追随者，又要利用国际新闻工作者协会第六次代表大会，变本加厉地进行假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖，假团结、真分裂的罪恶活动。他们在会议之前，就派人四出活动，阴谋破坏亚、非、拉进步新闻工作者的团结，加紧煽动反华。关于这次执委会和代表大会的筹备工作，国际新闻工作者协会书记处对中华全国新闻工作者协会实行严密封锁，甚至准备提交代表大会的主要文件，如总书记的报告，一直没有发给我们。这是一种极不民主、极不正常的恶劣作法。
    鉴于以上种种情况，中华全国新闻工作者协会当然不可能派出自己的代表团参加国际新闻工作者协会的这次执委会和第六次代表大会。我们认为，全世界进步新闻工作者必须彻底揭露苏联修正主义领导集团利用国际新闻工作者协会推行其投降分裂路线的丑恶面目，必须同他们彻底划清界限，而决不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。我们必须建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的国际统一战线。这个统一战线绝不能包括充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的苏联修正主义领导集团。相反，他们只能是国际反美统一战线的斗争对象。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”我们进步新闻工作者就是这支文化军队的一个重要组成部分。中国新闻工作者愿同全世界的进步新闻工作者一起，把我们手中的笔杆子，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争，全力支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何重大代价，直到把美国侵略者全部、彻底、干净地赶出越南，取得最后胜利。
    毛泽东主席说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”全世界一切进步的新闻工作者，让我们团结起来，联合世界上一切反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的人们，把反对美帝及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把世界人民革命事业推向前进。
