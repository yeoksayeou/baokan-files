One afternoon, soldiers stationed in a remote mountain area beat drums and gongs, shouting slogans, as if celebrating a grand festival. It turned out that twenty-nine soldiers were celebrating the joyous event of receiving their copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

This spring, these twenty-nine soldiers came to this remote mountain area to carry out their mission. They said:

"We may be far from our leaders and carrying out our mission alone, but we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to guide us. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively."

Although each soldier had "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," only the platoon leader had a complete set of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

When the news came that the Central Committee had decided to publish a large number of Chairman Mao's works, everyone was overjoyed. They jointly wrote a long letter full of revolutionary passion to the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore Mail Order Department, expressing their urgent desire to obtain the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The next day, this letter, representing the hearts of twenty-nine soldiers, flew from a remote mountain valley in the motherland to Beijing, to the side of the reddest red sun—Chairman Mao.

A few days later, twenty-nine neatly packaged sets of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were sent from the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore Mail Order Department. Upon hearing that the precious books had arrived, who could not be happy? They shouted, "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" The resounding shouts echoed through the valley. New soldier Zhou Baoren, holding the four-volume golden book, could not hold back his tears. He said, "In the past, when I saw someone holding the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' I thought they were the happiest person. Today, I am also the happiest person." The twenty-nine soldiers jumped and danced, holding hands and singing the song "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman." Finally, the platoon leader read the letter from the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore Mail Order Department. Looking at the brand-new "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and listening to the voice from Beijing, everyone's face beamed with happiness.

The next day, the twenty-nine soldiers jointly wrote a letter of thanks to the comrades of the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore Mail Order Department. The letter said: "You sent twenty-nine sets of the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' to the mountain area, and a red sun that never sets rose in the mountain area. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, and our twenty-nine red hearts will forever be toward the red sun. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, work hard on our words, and strengthen our ideological transformation. We will defend Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to the death, carry out the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end. Let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the entire universe red."

    山区战士的欢笑
    红兵
    一天下午，驻守某山区的战士们敲锣打鼓，高呼口号，好像过盛大的节日一样热闹。原来这是二十九名战士在庆祝自己得到《毛泽东选集》的大喜事。
    今年春天，这二十九名战士来到这偏僻山区执行任务。他们说：
  “我们虽然远离领导，单独执行任务，但一定要靠毛泽东思想给我们掌舵，我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作。”虽然每个战士都有《毛泽东著作选读》和《毛主席语录》，但全排只有排长有一套《毛泽东选集》。
    党中央决定大量出版毛主席著作消息传来，大家真是欣喜若狂。他们联名给北京新华书店邮购部写了一封充满革命激情的长信，表达了战士们渴望得到《毛泽东选集》的无限迫切的心情。第二天，这封代表着二十九颗红心的信，从祖国的一个偏僻山沟飞向北京，飞向最红最红的红太阳——毛主席身边。
    几天以后，包装整整齐齐的二十九套《毛泽东选集》，从北京新华书店邮购部寄来了。战士们听说宝书邮来了，哪个不高兴，他们高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”响亮的呼声震动了山谷。新战士周保仁手捧四卷金书，抑制不住的热泪滚滚往外流。他说：“过去我看到拿着《毛泽东选集》的人，就认为他是最幸福不过了。今天我也是最幸福的人了。”二十九名战士跳跃着，手挽着手纵情唱起《大海航行靠舵手》的歌曲。最后，排长给大家念北京新华书店邮购部革命职工写来的信。战士们望着崭新的《毛泽东选集》，听着北京来的声音，每个人的脸上都露出幸福的微笑。
    第二天，二十九名战士又联名给北京新华书店邮购部同志写了感谢信。信中说：“你们把二十九套《毛泽东选集》寄到山区，山区升起了永远不落的红太阳。毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，我们二十九颗红心永远向着红太阳。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，加强思想改造。我们要誓死保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。让毛泽东思想的光辉把整个宇宙照得通红通红。”
