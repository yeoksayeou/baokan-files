The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) recently issued a statement exposing the collusion between U.S. imperialism and revisionists in plotting a new "peace talk" deception over the Vietnam issue. The statement also expressed support for the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, vowing to fight to the end until final victory is achieved.

The statement said: The U.S. fascists have been swallowed up by the vast ocean of the Vietnamese people's war. While they are desperately intensifying their aggression, they are also cunningly pushing forward their "peace talk" deception. Their various lackeys—from counter-revolutionary revisionist traitors to their running dogs in various countries—are conspiring, utilizing all their institutions, such as the United Nations General Assembly, to plot new "peace talk" schemes to serve U.S. imperialism. The statement said, "The tested Vietnamese people will never allow them to succeed. Their vile collusion will only make them the constant target of criticism from all those who uphold justice."

    西南非洲民族联盟发表声明支持越南人民斗争
    谴责修正主义者为美帝侵越效劳
    据新华社开罗电　西南非洲民族联盟最近发表声明，揭露美帝国主义和修正主义者勾结在越南问题上策划新的“和谈”骗局。声明还表示支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    声明说：美国法西斯已经淹没在越南人民战争的汪洋大海之中，他们一面竭力加紧进行侵略战争，一面狡猾地加紧推行“和谈”骗局。他们各色各样的仆从——从反革命修正主义叛徒直到他们在各国的走狗——正在进行密谋，利用他们的全部机构，如联合国大会等，来策划新的“和谈”阴谋，为美帝国主义效劳。声明说，“经受过考验的越南人民，是决不会让他们得逞的。他们进行丑恶的勾结，只会使他们成为一切主持正义的人们不断抨击的目标。”
