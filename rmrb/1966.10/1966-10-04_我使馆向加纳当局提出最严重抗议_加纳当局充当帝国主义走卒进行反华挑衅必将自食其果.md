Our embassy has lodged the most severe protest with the Ghanaian authorities. Ghanaian authorities acting as lackeys of imperialism in provoking anti-China incidents will reap what they sow.

		NEW DELHI, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Ghana today handed a note to the Ghanaian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lodging the most serious protest against the Ghanaian authorities' implementation of anti-China policies and creation of anti-China incidents. The full text of the note is as follows:

		Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ghana:

		The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Ghana, on behalf of the Chinese government, makes the following statement:

		On September 23, 1966, the General Secretary of the Ghana Trade Union Congress, Bentum, took advantage of the transit of the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique, Yang Xikun, and others through Accra Airport to violently obstruct the work of a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, holding a press conference to maliciously fabricate the story that the Chinese Embassy is harboring Red Guards and launching a vicious attack on the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

		The above-mentioned anti-China incident is another serious step taken by the Ghanaian authorities in implementing their anti-China policies. Since the Chinese people launched the great Cultural Revolution, official Ghanaian newspapers have been continuously engaging in anti-China clamor. Since August alone, the "Ghana Times," "News Evening Post," and "Daily Graphic" have published more than ten articles viciously slandering the Chinese Cultural Revolution, inciting trouble, and interfering in China's internal affairs. It is particularly important to point out that these newspapers have shamelessly attacked the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, which is absolutely intolerable to the 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese Embassy hereby lodges the most serious protest against the Ghanaian authorities.

		All these actions by the Ghanaian authorities are completely those of a lackey of imperialism. You will not gain anything by doing so. If you do not take effective measures to stop anti-China actions, you will only reap what you sow.

		Embassy of the People's Republic of China

		October 1, 1966, Accra

		According to Xinhua News Agency, Oct. 2: Accra news: Since August this year, the Ghanaian military junta, through its controlled newspapers, has continuously published more than ten anti-China editorials and articles, shamelessly attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and even viciously slandering the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. The Ghanaian authorities' serious provocative behavior once again exposes their ugly role as lackeys and vanguards of imperialism's anti-China campaign.

		China's unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution is advancing victoriously across the country. Revolutionary people all over the world are thrilled by it, while a handful of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries are in a state of panic, terrified to death. They have launched an anti-China wave, making shameless slanders against China. At this time, the Ghanaian authorities, disregarding the repeated verbal protests of the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, have used despicable fabrication and slander in the "Ghana Times," "News Evening Post," and "Daily Graphic" to repeat the hackneyed phrases used by the imperialist propaganda machine, viciously slandering China's great cultural revolution and abusing the Red Guards, who play a vanguard role in the Chinese Cultural Revolution, as "bandits."

		On September 23, the General Secretary of the Ghana Trade Union Congress, Bentum, took advantage of the transit of the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique, Yang Xikun, and others through Accra Airport to violently obstruct the normal work of a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, holding a press conference to maliciously fabricate the story that the Chinese Embassy is harboring Red Guards and launching a vicious attack on the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

		All these despicable plots by the Ghanaian authorities, apart from exposing their own reactionary nature, cannot deceive the Ghanaian people. A Ghanaian friend, in a letter full of enthusiasm praising the Chinese Cultural Revolution, pointed out, "The Chinese Cultural Revolution has destroyed the last hope of China's enemies, so what is strange about the great shock, anger, and clamor in the imperialist press?" Another Ghanaian friend pointed out that Bentum's press conference was a "vicious attack on 700 million Chinese people."

		The Ghanaian junta, following the imperialists and modern revisionists, has been spreading lies, slanders, and insults against the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. All these are just a few flies buzzing, which cannot stop the wheels of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from rolling forward, nor can they prevent the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought from spreading widely among the revolutionary people of the world.

    我使馆向加纳当局提出最严重抗议
    加纳当局充当帝国主义走卒进行反华挑衅必将自食其果
    新华社阿克拉一日电  中华人民共和国驻加纳共和国大使馆今天向加纳外交部递交了一份照会，对加纳当局执行反华政策、制造反华事件提出最严重的抗议。照会全文如下：加纳外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻加纳共和国大使馆奉中国政府之命，向加纳外交部申述如下：
    一九六六年九月二十三日，加纳工会大会总书记本图姆竟利用蒋介石匪帮的“外交部次长”杨西昆等人路经阿克拉机场时横暴地阻挠中国新华社记者进行正常工作事，举行记者招待会，别有用心地捏造中国大使馆窝藏红卫兵并大肆攻击中国文化大革命。
    上述反华事件是加纳当局执行反华政策的又一个严重步骤。自从中国人民进行伟大的文化大革命以来，加纳官方报纸就不断地进行反华叫嚣。仅自八月以来，《加纳时报》、《新闻晚报》和《每日写真报》即发表了十余篇恶毒诬蔑中国文化大革命的文章，进行煽动，干涉中国内政。特别要严重指出的是，这些报纸竟然肆无忌惮地攻击中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，这是七亿中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。中国大使馆特向加纳当局提出最严重的抗议。
    加纳当局这一切行径，完全是充当了帝国主义走卒的角色。你们这样做，是不会捞到什么好处的。如果你们不采取有效措施，停止反华行动，你们将只会自食恶果。
    中华人民共和国驻
      加纳共和国大使馆
        一九六六年十月
          一日于阿克拉
    据新华社二日讯　阿克拉消息：加纳军事政变当局通过它控制的报纸自今年八月以来连续发表了十多篇反华社论和文章，肆无忌惮地攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命，甚至恶毒地诽谤中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席。加纳当局的这种严重挑衅行为，再次暴露了它充当帝国主义反华的走卒和急先锋的丑恶嘴脸。
    中国史无前例的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命正在全中国范围内胜利地向前发展。全世界革命人民莫不为之欢欣鼓舞，而一小撮帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派却惊惶万状，害怕得要死，他们掀起反华浪潮，对中国进行无耻的诬蔑。正在这个时候，加纳当局不顾中国驻加纳大使馆多次的口头抗议，在《加纳时报》、《新闻晚报》、《每日写真报》上采用可耻的捏造、诽谤的手段，重复帝国主义的宣传机器所使用的陈词滥调，恶毒地诬蔑中国伟大的文化大革命，谩骂在中国文化大革命中起急先锋作用的红卫兵是什么“匪帮”。
    九月二十三日，加纳工会大会总书记本图姆竟利用蒋介石匪帮的“外交部次长”杨西昆等人路过阿克拉机场时横暴地阻挠新华社记者进行正常工作一事举行记者招待会，别有用心地捏造中国大使馆“窝藏红卫兵”，并且大肆攻击中国文化大革命。
    加纳当局的这一切卑鄙阴谋除了暴露他们自己的反动嘴脸以外，是骗不了加纳人民的。一位加纳朋友在一封热情洋溢赞扬中国文化大革命的信中指出，中国文化大革命“毁灭了中国的敌人的最后希望，在帝国主义报刊引起这么大的震惊、狂怒和叫嚷，这有什么奇怪呢？”另一位加纳朋友指出，本图姆的记者招待会是“向七亿中国人民进行恶毒的攻击”。
    加纳政变当局追随帝国主义和现代修正主义对中国文化大革命和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的造谣、诬蔑、谩骂、攻击，都只不过是几只苍蝇嗡嗡叫，决不能阻挡中国无产阶级文化大革命的车轮滚滚向前，更不能阻挡光芒万丈的毛泽东思想在世界革命人民中的广泛传播。
