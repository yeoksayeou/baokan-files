With unbounded love for Chairman Mao and learning from the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army's Long March, the "Long March Red Guards" from the Dalian Maritime Institute trekked 2,000 li to Beijing for a revolutionary link-up.

Fifteen revolutionary students from the Dalian Maritime Institute spent a month braving wind and rain, crossing mountains and rivers, and passing through twenty-one counties and cities. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings that "the Long March is a manifesto, a propaganda corps, and a sowing machine." Along the way, they studied Chairman Mao's works, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, learned from the workers and peasants, and strictly observed the three disciplines and eight points of attention. The local people praised them as loyal little red soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The New China News Agency reported on October 21 that under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, fifteen revolutionary students from the Dalian Maritime Institute formed the "Long March Red Guards." With unbounded love for the great leader Chairman Mao, they learned from the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army's 10,000-li Long March. With indomitable revolutionary will, they braved wind and rain, crossed mountains and rivers, and overcame numerous difficulties. In one month, they trekked over 2,000 li from Dalian to the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the great capital of our motherland, Beijing—to engage in revolutionary link-ups.

The revolutionary youngsters carried a bright red banner of the "Long March Red Guards," backpacks on their shoulders, and Chairman Mao's works in their hearts. They studied Chairman Mao's works and propagated Mao Zedong Thought along the way. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, emulated the PLA's three-eight work style, learned from the workers and peasants wherever they went, and helped with chores and production labor wherever they stayed. They took the PLA as their model and strictly observed the three disciplines and eight points of attention. The workers and peasants along the way warmly praised them as "loyal little red soldiers of Chairman Mao," "heirs of the old Red Army and the Eighth Route Army," and "propagators of Mao Zedong Thought."

In August, when revolutionary students and teachers across the country were engaged in revolutionary link-ups under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Li Longfu and other students from the Ship and Electrical Engineering Class of 1961 at the Dalian Maritime Institute were arranged to be the first batch to travel to Beijing by car for revolutionary link-ups. How they wished to fly to Chairman Mao's side! But they also thought, if they could undertake a "mini Long March" like the Red Army and walk to Beijing, wouldn't that be a better way to temper themselves? Thus, they made up their minds: they would set out on foot to Beijing to see Chairman Mao.

On the morning of August 25, fifteen revolutionary youngsters set out on their journey, braving wind and rain, not taking cars or boats, crossing mountains and rivers, and passing through twenty-one counties and cities in Liaoning and Hebei provinces and one agricultural reclamation area. In the vast world, they endured wind and rain, saw the world, and underwent a stern test of revolutionary will. Along the way, the youngsters, inspired by the great Mao Zedong Thought, were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and trampled one difficulty after another underfoot. When they encountered strong winds and heavy rain during their march, they would recite Chairman Mao's poems, "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the Long March, ten thousand rivers and mountains are but trifles..." and sing revolutionary songs, advancing against the wind and rain. Sometimes, when a big river blocked their path, they would encourage each other with Chairman Mao's great practice of swimming the Yangtze River and the magnificent lines, "No matter how the wind blows or the waves beat, it is like a leisurely stroll in the courtyard." They would not take boats or cross bridges but swim across the river. The youngsters said, "Chairman Mao swam the Yangtze River at the age of seventy-three. We are the future sailors of New China and should endure the trials of great winds and waves." When their feet swelled and blistered, and they felt tired, they would read Chairman Mao's quotations, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and immediately become spirited and full of courage. When mosquitoes disturbed their sleep at the campsite, they would think of the hardships endured by revolutionary forerunners and say, "Our conditions are much better than those of the Red Army in the past. What right do we have to complain?" In a month's journey, they overcame storms and floods, crossed rivers and mountains, and successfully reached Beijing.

The warriors of the "Long March Red Guards" followed Chairman Mao's great statement that "the Long March is a manifesto, a propaganda corps, and a sowing machine" and declared, "We want to be the sowing machines of the revolution and spread Mao Zedong Thought to every corner." They studied and propagated along the way, spreading Mao Zedong Thought wherever they went. They read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud to the villagers in the fields and carefully explained the Sixteen Points and the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee; they posted revolutionary leaflets and slogans in villages and markets, actively propagating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Every day, no matter how tired they were from long-distance marches or how inconvenient their living conditions were, the first thing they did upon arriving at the campsite was to find newspapers and documents to study by the faint light of a candle. Whenever important editorials were published, they would promptly print them out and distribute them to the masses. To let more people hear the voices of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, they specially chose mountain roads upon entering Hebei Province to propagate the revolution to the people in remote mountain areas. To make Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in people's hearts and known to every household, they saved money along the way to buy steel plates and paper to print revolutionary leaflets and slogans; when the Party Central Committee issued the call to "grasp revolution and promote production," they joined the villagers in the autumn harvest night battle, working and propagating at the same time. These enthusiastic propagators of Mao Zedong Thought not only propagated to the masses but also educated themselves. They not only tempered a pair of iron feet but also made their hearts redder.

The warriors of the "Long March Red Guards" deeply understood that to propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, one must first study Mao Zedong Thought well. They would rather carry fewer luggage and clothes than leave behind Chairman Mao's works and propaganda materials. On rainy days, their clothes were soaked, but they used the only raincoat in the team to wrap Chairman Mao's Selected Works. They said, "Clothes will dry soon, but the precious books must not be soaked by the rain. They are our lifeblood!" Along the way, no matter how tired or busy they were, they never neglected studying Chairman Mao's works. Moreover, the busier, the more tired, and the more difficulties they faced, the more they studied Chairman Mao's works. They learned and applied in actual struggles. The great Mao Zedong Thought illuminated their path forward, gave them the courage and strength to overcome difficulties, and made them advance step by step and grow continuously on the revolutionary journey of the "mini Long March."

The deeds of the youngsters of the "Long March Red Guards," who strove to learn and enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, deeply moved the revolutionary masses along the way. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically supported them. Printing workers worked through the night to print propaganda materials for them; some poor and lower-middle peasants rode bicycles for dozens of li to get propaganda materials on Mao Zedong Thought; some Red Guards wrote letters at night to be delivered to Chairman Mao by them, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life. People praised these revolutionary youngsters for bringing the old Eighth Route Army style, saying, "With such successors, the revolution of China and the world has hope!"

Chairman Mao said, "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the workers and peasants to truly learn." The youngsters of the "Long March Red Guards" followed Chairman Mao's teachings, organizing visits, interviews, and discussions along the way, and seizing every opportunity to learn from workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary veterans. From Dalian to Beijing, they held over forty discussions with old workers, old poor and lower-middle peasants, old Eighth Route Army soldiers, and revolutionary students. Through these activities, they received profound class education and revolutionary tradition education. In Jin County, they visited the labor model and active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Ma Yucheng. This old poor peasant, who never forgot his class bitterness and deeply cherished his blood debt, loved the Party and Chairman Mao, and persistently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, deeply educated the revolutionary youngsters. They resolved to be like the old poor peasant, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good students of Chairman Mao. In early September, they came to the famous "Tashan Hero Regiment" battle area, where they paid tribute to the "Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Tower of the Tashan Blocking Battle." Every mountain, river, grass, and tree here recorded the glorious deeds of the heroes. The youngsters stood on the land watered by the heroes' hot blood and in front of the martyrs' memorial tower, solemnly pledged, "We, the 'Long March Red Guards,' will follow in your footsteps, take up your guns, continue the fight, and complete your unfinished mission. For the eternal prosperity of our great motherland, for the construction and defense of the proletarian iron fortress, we are ready to endure hardships and sacrifices at any time, forever following Chairman Mao in the revolution!"

In the great capital of our motherland, the revolutionary youngsters of the "Long March Red Guards" happily saw the great leader Chairman Mao, whom they had longed for day and night. Li Longfu represented the team and honorably ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum on October 1, together with representatives from all over the country, and was received by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Now, the youngsters of the "Long March Red Guards" are about to leave Beijing and return to school. They firmly declared that they would bring Chairman Mao's support and care for the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary spirit and experience of the capital's revolutionary students back to Dalian and the school. They would resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    怀着对毛主席的无比热爱　学习红军长征的革命精神
    “长征红卫队”步行两千里来京进行革命串连
    大连海运学院十五名革命学生，用一个月的时间，不怕风雨，跋山涉水，走过了二十一个县市。他们遵照毛主席关于“长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机”的教导，一路学习毛主席著作，一路宣传毛泽东思想，一路向工农群众学习，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意。沿途群众赞扬他们是毛主席的忠实红小兵。
    新华社二十一日讯　在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，大连海运学院十五名革命学生组成的“长征红卫队”，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，学习红军万里长征的革命精神，以顽强的革命毅力跋山涉水，战胜重重困难，用一个月的时间从大连步行二千余里，来到无产阶级文化大革命的中心——我们伟大祖国的首都北京进行革命串连。
    革命小将们扛着鲜红的“长征红卫队”的队旗，身背背包，胸怀宝书，一路学习毛主席著作，一路宣传毛泽东思想。他们遵循毛主席的教导，发扬解放军的三八作风，走到哪里就向哪里的工农群众学习；驻在哪里，就帮助哪里的群众担水、扫院子，参加生产劳动。他们以解放军为榜样，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意。沿途的工农群众热情地赞扬他们是“毛主席的忠实红小兵”，“老红军、老八路的红后代”，“毛泽东思想的宣传队”。
    八月间，正当各地革命师生在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下进行革命大串连的时候，大连海运学院船电六一级学生李隆夫等被安排第一批乘车赴京进行革命串连。他们多么想一下子飞到毛主席身边啊！但是，他们又想，如果像红军那样，进行一次“小长征”，步行到北京，不是可以得到更好的锻炼吗？于是，他们下定决心：迈开双脚，走到北京去见毛主席。
    八月二十五日清晨，十五名革命小将雄赳赳气昂昂地踏上了征途。他们不怕风、不怕雨，不乘车、不坐船，逢山过山，遇水涉水，用自己的双脚迈过了辽宁、河北两省的二十一个县市和一个农垦区，在广阔的天地里经了风雨，见了世面，受到了一次严峻的革命意志的锻炼。一路上，小将们在伟大的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，满怀革命豪情，把一个又一个的困难踩在脚下。当他们在行军途中遇到六、七级大风和滂沱大雨的时候，他们就齐声朗诵毛主席的诗句“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲……”，高唱革命歌曲，迎着风雨前进。有时，遇到大河拦路，他们就以毛主席畅游长江的伟大实践和“不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步”的壮丽诗句互相鼓舞，不搭船、不过桥，泅渡过河。小将们说：“毛主席七十三岁还畅游长江，我们是新中国未来的海员，更应该经受大风大浪的考验。”当他们走得脚肿起泡，感到疲乏的时候，他们就朗读毛主席的语录“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，立刻精神抖擞，勇气百倍。当宿营地蚊虫打扰，不能安睡的时候，他们就想起革命前辈走过的艰难历程，他们说：我们现在的条件比起当年的红军，不知好了多少倍，有什么理由叫苦呢？在一个月的征途中，他们就这样地战胜了狂风暴雨，越过百水千山，胜利地到达了北京。
    “长征红卫队”的战士们遵照毛主席关于“长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机”的伟大论述，提出了“我们要做革命的播种机，把毛泽东思想传遍每个角落”的豪言壮语，他们在途中边学习，边宣传，走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想传播到哪里。他们在田间、地头给社员高声朗读毛主席语录，细心讲解十六条和中共八届十一中全会的公报；在村镇、集市张贴革命的传单和标语，积极宣传毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。每天，不管远途行军多么劳累，居住条件多么不便，他们一到宿营地，第一件事就是找报纸、学文件，在微弱的烛光下刻印文化大革命的宣传品。每当报上发表重要社论，他们就及时油印出来，散发到群众中。为了让更多的人听到党中央、毛主席的声音，他们在进入河北省后，特地选择山路走，向偏僻山区的群众进行革命宣传。他们为了让毛泽东思想深入人心，家喻户晓，一路上省吃俭用，把节省下来的钱购买钢板和纸张，印刷革命传单和标语；当党中央刚刚发出“抓革命，促生产”的号召，他们就和社员一道进行秋收夜战，一面干活，一面宣传。这些热情宣传毛泽东思想的红色宣传员，既宣传了群众，又教育了自己。他们不但炼出了一副铁脚板，而且把一颗红心炼得更红了。
    “长征红卫队”的战士们深深地懂得，要宣传好毛泽东思想，首先要自己学习好毛泽东思想。他们宁肯少带行李、衣物，也要带上毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，多带宣传品。在阴雨连绵的日子里，他们身上穿的衣服淋湿，却把全队唯一的一件雨衣用来包着《毛泽东选集》。他们说：“衣服打湿了，一会儿就会干的，宝书可千万不能被雨淋着，这是我们的命根子！”一路上，他们不论怎样疲劳，怎样繁忙，从不耽误学习毛主席著作。而且，他们越是繁忙，越是疲劳，越是有困难，越要学习毛主席著作。他们在实际斗争中学，在实际斗争中用。伟大的毛泽东思想照亮了他们前进的道路，给了他们克服困难的勇气和力量，使他们在“小长征”的革命征途上一步一个脚印，不断前进，不断成长。
    “长征红卫队”的小将们，努力学习毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想的动人事迹，深深地感动了沿途的革命群众。广大工人、贫下中农都热情支持他们。印刷工人为了给他们赶印宣传品，彻夜不眠地工作；有的贫下中农骑车追赶几十里向他们要宣传毛泽东思想的传单；有的红卫兵连夜写信托他们带给毛主席，祝毛主席万寿无疆。人们称赞这些革命小将带来了老八路作风，他们说：“有了这样的接班人，中国和世界的革命就有希望了！”
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”“长征红卫队”的小将们遵照毛主席的教导，沿途组织参观、访问和座谈，利用一切机会向工人、贫下中农和革命老前辈学习。从大连到北京的途中，他们同老工人、老贫农、老八路和革命学生一起，一共举行了四十多次座谈会。通过这些活动，他们受到极其深刻的阶级教育和革命传统教育。在金县，他们访问了劳动模范、学习毛主席著作积极分子马玉成。这位老贫农不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，无限热爱党和毛主席，长期坚持活学活用毛主席著作的事迹，深深地教育了革命小将。他们决心像老贫农那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。九月上旬的一个中午，他们来到著名的“塔山英雄团”浴血战斗过的塔山地区，瞻仰了“塔山阻击战革命烈士纪念塔”。这里的一山一水，一草一木都记录着当年英雄们的光辉业绩。小将们站在革命先烈们用热血灌溉过的土地上，站在烈士纪念塔前，庄严地宣誓：“我们‘长征红卫队’要踏着你们的血迹，接过你们手中的枪，继续战斗，去完成你们未竟的事业。为了使伟大祖国千秋万代不变颜色，为了建设和保卫无产阶级的铁打江山，我们随时准备经受千辛万苦，不惜牺牲自己的一切，永远跟着毛主席干革命！”
    在伟大祖国的首都，“长征红卫队”的革命小将们幸福地见到了日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席。李隆夫同学还在十月一日那天代表全队光荣地登上了天安门城楼，同来自全国各地的代表一起，受到了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的接见。现在，“长征红卫队”的小将们即将离京返校。他们坚决表示一定要把毛主席对革命群众的支持和关怀，把首都革命师生的革命精神和革命经验，带回大连，带回学校，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
