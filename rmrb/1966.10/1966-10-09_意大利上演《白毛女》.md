A group of Italian actors performed the famous Chinese revolutionary drama "The White-Haired Girl" in Turin on the 5th. The performance was enthusiastically received. This was the first time the play was staged in Italy.

During the intermissions, pictures and excerpts from documentaries were shown, accompanied by explanations through a loudspeaker. These images and film clips depicted the great Chinese revolution from 1925 to the founding of the People's Republic of China, providing the audience with historical context and helping them better understand the drama.

A portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong appeared on the screen for an extended period, while the loudspeaker introduced Mao's historically significant leadership role in the Chinese revolution.

The pictures and film clips also covered the Long March and the War of Liberation. The loudspeaker recited Mao's famous poem: "Even more delightful is the thousand-mile snow of Mount Min, after the army passes, all smiles."

The audience applauded enthusiastically at the end of each act.
