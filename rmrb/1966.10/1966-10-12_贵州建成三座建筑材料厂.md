Guizhou Province has, based on the characteristics of its local mountainous regions, rapidly and efficiently constructed three new-type building material factories. These factories have already produced large quantities of sand-lime bricks, shale bricks, and fly-ash concrete blocks. They have also successfully trial-produced fly-ash shale sintered bricks, medium-sized hollow concrete blocks, and large cement tiles. These products have significantly supported national construction and saved a considerable amount of timber.

    贵州建成三座建筑材料厂
    贵州省从当地山区特点出发，多快好省地建成了三座新型建筑材料工厂，并已生产出大批灰砂砖、页岩砖和粉煤灰砌块，试制出粉煤灰页岩烧结砖、混凝土中型空心砌块和水泥大瓦等新产品。这些产品有力地支援了国家建设，节约了大量木材。
