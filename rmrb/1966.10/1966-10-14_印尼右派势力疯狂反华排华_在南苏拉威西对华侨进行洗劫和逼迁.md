The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have recently continued their anti-Chinese and expelling Chinese activities in South Sulawesi, brutally persecuting and expelling Chinese residents. This is another heinous anti-Chinese and expelling Chinese activity by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces following the large-scale anti-Chinese and expelling Chinese actions in the Aceh region.

Chinese residents in Barru, South Sulawesi, were attacked and robbed by local right-wing thugs in the afternoon of September 24. The mob shouted slogans such as "Drive out the Chinese" and "Chinese get out," and tore down and destroyed the signs of all Chinese shops in the city. The thugs then raided every Chinese shop and residence, tearing up and stealing all Chinese books, newspapers, and magazines, and tearing up and stealing portraits of Chinese leaders and the national flag of the People's Republic of China. Some Chinese residents' clothing was also stolen. The thugs even forbade Chinese residents from speaking Chinese, and if they were caught speaking Chinese, they were interfered with or beaten.

Chinese residents in Banggai, South Sulawesi, have recently been continuously forced to leave by local right-wing soldiers and thugs. On September 22, the local military commander summoned Chinese residents and issued an expulsion order, demanding that all Chinese residents voluntarily leave Banggai by September 27. On September 23, another batch of organized thugs forcibly summoned all Chinese residents, giving them three days to leave the area, and threatening and insulting the Chinese residents in various ways. Currently, a large number of Chinese residents have been forced to move to Sijang, staying with relatives and friends.

Chinese residents in Lembah and Polewali islands under the jurisdiction of Soppeng and Polewali Mandar counties have also received expulsion orders from local police and district heads, ordering them to leave these areas within the shortest possible time. Chinese shops in Mandai have been illegally ordered to close by the local government since September 15.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on October 11, under the personal mediation of U.S. imperialism, the Indonesian right-wing military regime, which has been secretly colluding with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, has turned to open activities, serving U.S. imperialism's anti-Chinese conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

According to reports from the Chiang clique's newspapers, the Indonesian right-wing military regime recently signed a "mutual assistance cooperation plan" with the Chiang clique in the United States. On October 6, it openly sent five "commercial representatives" to Taiwan to engage in activities.

The Chiang clique's newspapers also revealed that the Indonesian right-wing military regime and the Chiang clique are plotting a "fishing cooperation plan." In addition, both sides are doing "bridge-building" work to open a regular air route between Jakarta and Taipei to further strengthen so-called "contacts between the two governments."

    印尼右派势力疯狂反华排华
    在南苏拉威西对华侨进行洗劫和逼迁
    新华社十一日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派反动势力最近继续在南苏拉威西进行反华排华活动，蛮横地对华侨进行迫害和逼迁。这是印尼右派反动势力继亚齐地区大规模反华逼迁的又一反华排华的罪恶活动。
    居住在南苏拉威西巴罗坡的华侨九月二十四日下午，遭受当地右派暴徒的轮番袭击和抢劫。成群暴徒狂喊：“赶走华人”、“华人滚出去”等反华排华口号，并且把全市华侨商店的招牌拆下毁坏，然后暴徒又到每一家华侨商店、住宅大肆搜查，撕毁和抢走所有中文书报杂志，并且撕毁中华人民共和国国旗和中国领导人挂像。有的华侨的衣物也被抢走了。暴徒甚至不准华侨讲中国话，如果讲中国话被暴徒听到，就遭到干涉或殴打。
    在南苏拉威西邦加英宜的华侨最近连续地遭到当地右派军人和暴徒的逼迁。九月二十二日当地驻军司令召集华侨下了驱逐令，限所有华侨必须在九月二十七日以前自动搬离邦加英宜。九月二十三日又有一批有组织的暴徒，强行召集所有华侨限期三天以内离开这一地区，并对华侨进行百般威吓和侮辱。目前已有一大部分华侨被逼迁到锡江，寄宿在亲友家中。
    在宋古明那沙县属下的兰梦和波勒哇里县属下的邻岛华侨也先后接到当地警察和区长的驱逐令，限他们在最短期间内离开这些地区。在万岱营的华侨商店，从九月十五日起被当地政府悍然无理地下令全部关闭。
    据新华社十一日讯在美帝国主义的亲自撮合下，印度尼西亚右派军人政权与台湾蒋介石匪帮由偷偷摸摸的暗中勾结，转入明目张胆的活动，为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的反华阴谋效劳。
    据蒋帮报刊透露，印度尼西亚右派军人政权最近在美国同蒋帮签订了“互助合作计划”。十月六日，又公然派遣“商务代表”五人到台湾活动。
    蒋帮报纸还透露，印度尼西亚右派军人政权和蒋帮正在谋划一项“渔业合作计划”。另外，双方正就开辟雅加达—台北定期航线做“搭桥”工作，以便进一步加强所谓“两国政府”的广泛接触。
