The spokesperson of the Asian Committee of the New Forces Games issued a statement on October 6, severely condemning the recent unjustified "ban" imposed by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) and the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) on their Asian member associations from participating in the upcoming first Asian New Forces Games, as well as their threatening behavior.

The spokesperson stated that this is another instance of the U.S. imperialists, through the International Olympic Committee (IOC), instigating the IAAF and FIFA to disrupt the normal sporting activities of the Asian people. This is a serious provocation against the Asian New Forces Games and cannot but arouse the strong condemnation of the peoples and athletes of various Asian countries.

The spokesperson emphasized that the Asian New Forces Games are independently and autonomously organized by the peoples of various Asian countries, and Asian athletes have the legitimate right to participate. No international organization has the right to interfere.

The spokesperson said that the holding of the first Asian New Forces Games reflects the common aspiration of the peoples of various Asian countries to break through the monopoly and control of imperialism and to independently and autonomously develop their sports. This is an irresistible trend that no force can stop. If the IOC, IAAF, FIFA, and other reactionary international sports organizations insist on their bullying tactics, they will inevitably face greater resistance from the peoples of various Asian countries, and their failure will be even more disastrous!

The spokesperson concluded by expressing confidence that the peoples and athletes of various Asian countries will raise the banner of unity against imperialism even higher and contribute all their strength to the success of the first Asian New Forces Games.

    新运会亚委会发言人痛斥美帝操纵国际田联足联破坏亚洲新运会
    亚洲人民决心独立自主地发展体育事业
    据新华社六日讯　新兴力量运动会亚洲委员会发言人六日发表谈话，严厉谴责国际业余田径联合会和国际足球联合会最近无理“禁止”其亚洲会员协会参加即将举行的第一届亚洲新运会并进行威胁的恶霸行为。
    发言人说，这是美帝国主义操纵下的国际奥委会唆使国际田联、国际足联破坏亚洲人民正常的体育活动的又一恶霸行为，这是对亚洲新运会的严重挑衅，不能不引起亚洲各国人民和运动员的强烈谴责。
    发言人强调指出，亚洲新运会是亚洲各国人民独立自主举办的，亚洲各国运动员有参加的正当权利，任何国际组织都无权加以干涉。
    发言人说，第一届亚洲新运会的召开，反映了亚洲各国人民冲破帝国主义垄断和控制、独立自主发展体育事业的共同愿望，是任何力量都无法阻止的。如果国际奥委会、国际田联、国际足联等反动的国际体育组织硬要蛮干下去，其结果必然将遭到亚洲各国人民更大的反抗，它们的失败将会比以前更大更惨！
    发言人最后表示深信，亚洲各国人民和运动员将更高地举起团结反帝的大旗，为第一届亚洲新运会的胜利而贡献出全部力量。
