The people of Canberra, the capital of Australia, and Melbourne, another major city, held demonstrations to protest against U.S. President Johnson's activities in Australia.

When Johnson arrived in Canberra on the evening of the 20th, many people at the airport held up banners denouncing U.S. aggression in Vietnam to "welcome" him. The demonstrators shouted, "Johnson, go back!" Later, several hundred people with banners and placards gathered outside the hotel where Johnson was staying to hold a protest demonstration. The demonstrators' placards read, "Yankees, go back!" "No more Australian troops to Vietnam!" Despite the presence of hundreds of U.S. security personnel and local police providing protection for Johnson, he slipped away from the crowd like a rat crossing the street and sneaked into the hotel through a side door.

On the morning of the 21st, when Johnson went to the Parliament House in Canberra to deliver a television speech, several hundred demonstrators waiting there jeered and laughed at him. The demonstrators' placards read, "Butcher, go back!"

In Melbourne, on the morning of the 21st, just before Johnson was to pass by, walls and sidewalks along the route were covered with slogans reading, "Johnson, go to hell" and "The U.S. is an aggressor." When Johnson arrived in Melbourne that evening, 500 Australians held a demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate. The demonstrators' placards read, "Johnson not welcome!" "Yankees, go back!" "Yankees, get out of Vietnam!" "Stop bombing North Vietnam!" "No more troops to Vietnam!" Some placards compared Johnson to Hitler.

The people of Melbourne held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate on the 20th, before Johnson's arrival in Australia.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, October 20th, the U.S. President Johnson, who is currently visiting here, was greeted by more than 1,500 demonstrators shouting strong protests against U.S. aggression in Vietnam when he arrived at the Parliament House to attend a state banquet.

People held up hundreds of banners, some of which read, "Stop the massacre of Asians!" "The Manila Conference is for expanding the war!" "Yankees, get out of South Vietnam!" and "U.S., stop invading Vietnam!"

In other major cities of New Zealand, protests against Johnson's visit were also held, and thousands of leaflets reading "Johnson, go back!" were distributed.

    瘟神到哪里，哪里逐瘟神
    澳大利亚和新西兰人民示威，高呼约翰逊滚回去
    新华社墨尔本二十一日电　澳大利亚首都堪培拉和另一大城市墨尔本的群众，分别举行示威，抗议美国总统约翰逊到澳大利亚活动。
    在约翰逊二十日晚上到达堪培拉时，机场上许多群众拿着谴责美国侵略越南的标语牌“迎接”他，示威群众高呼：“约翰逊滚回去！”接着，又有数百名群众带着横幅和标语到约翰逊住的旅馆外边举行抗议示威。示威者的标语牌上写着：“美国佬，滚回去！”“不再派澳大利亚人参加越南战争！”尽管有数以百计的美国保安人员和当地的警察给约翰逊保镖，但是他像老鼠过街一样躲开了人群，从旁门偷偷溜进了旅馆。
    二十一日上午，当约翰逊到堪培拉议会大厦去发表电视演说时，等候在那里的数百名示威群众朝他发出嘘声和嘲笑声。示威者打着的标语牌上写着：“刽子手滚回去！”
    在墨尔本，二十一日清早，就在约翰逊将要经过的路旁墙上和人行道上出现了“约翰逊见鬼去”和“美国是侵略者”的标语。当约翰逊当天晚上到达墨尔本时，五百名澳大利亚人在美国领事馆外面举行示威。示威者的标语牌上写着，“不欢迎约翰逊！”“美国佬滚回去！”“美国佬滚出越南！”“停止轰炸越南北方！”“不许向越南增兵！”有的标语把约翰逊比作希特勒。
    墨尔本的群众二十日在约翰逊到达澳大利亚之前就在美国领事馆前举行了一次示威。
    据新华社惠灵顿二十日电　正在这里访问的美国总统约翰逊今天到达议会大厦参加国宴时，一千五百多示威的人齐声向他发出强烈的抗议吼声，反对美国侵略越南。
    人们高举着几百面横幅，其中有些横幅写着：“停止屠杀亚洲人！”“马尼拉会议是为了扩大战争！”“美国佬，从南越滚出去！”和“美国，停止侵略越南！”等口号。
    在新西兰其他各个大城市，也展开了抗议约翰逊访问的活动，散发了成千张写着“约翰逊，滚回去！”的传单。
