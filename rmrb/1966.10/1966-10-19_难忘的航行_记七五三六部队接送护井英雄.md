On the morning of August 8, two helicopters from the People's Liberation Army 7536 Unit, bathed in the morning sun, took off into the sky, heading east.

The pilots were extremely excited. They were going to pick up three seriously injured members of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team and take them to a place with better medical facilities for treatment.

	“Red Flight Path”

This was an unforgettable flight.

The place they were to land had no airport and no navigation equipment. What should they do? The pilots said, "The most important preparation is to study Chairman Mao's works. With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we fear no difficulties." Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the only purpose of this army." Five Good Pilot Zhao Congzheng said, "These heroes are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Our love for them is love for the Party, love for Chairman Mao, love for the people. We can contribute to the heroes' early recovery, this is the greatest honor." People saw this flight as a thorough test of serving the people, a test of implementing Chairman Mao's teachings, a test of one's revolutionary will. Although there was no flight path to the destination, Chairman Mao's teachings had drawn a "red flight path" in the pilots' hearts. Flying on this path, we will always be victorious!

Everyone carefully checked every part, every pipe, every joint, and every weld on the aircraft. They studied how to land and take off when the landing site was uneven, to minimize the pain of the injured. They tried to think of every possible problem and found solutions, then took off towards their destination.

	Meeting the Heroes

As soon as the aircraft landed, the pilots, despite their fatigue, rushed to the hospital. Before they even entered the ward, some lightly injured heroes had come out to welcome them. The heroes shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Thank you for the Party and Chairman Mao's care!" The pilots grasped their hands, too excited to speak.

Deputy Commander and Chief Engineer of the mine, Zhang Zhongmin, was seriously injured and could only sit on the bed. He said, "Thank you for Chairman Mao's care. We will definitely study Chairman Mao's works better in the future, learn from the PLA, reform our thoughts, and find more and larger oil and gas fields."

Ran Shurong lay on his stomach on the bed. Hearing that the pilots had come to see him, he happily said, "PLA comrades, I can't see you, I really want to see you!" The pilots walked to his side, bent down, and said close to his face, "We will learn from your heroic deeds, definitely like you, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

	Exchange of Revolutionary Enthusiasm

The aircraft returned with the three heroes, Zhang Zhongmin, Ran Shurong, and Huang Chenghou.

On the way there, to ensure accuracy and speed, they flew at a low altitude, navigating by the ground targets. This made the cabin temperature high. On the way back, the pilots, considering the high temperature was not good for the injured, made the aircraft fly as high as possible to lower the cabin temperature.

Not long after takeoff, clouds appeared in the sky. The pilots immediately thought that if they flew through the clouds, the aircraft's vibration would increase, causing more pain to the injured. They decided to make the aircraft climb above the cloud layer.

The aircraft flew steadily forward, and the sunlight illuminated the cabin. The injured requested to see the beautiful scenery of their motherland. The pilots and nurses gently helped the injured sit up. Everyone looked out of the window, gazing at the beautiful land of their motherland. Everyone leaned close to each other, exchanging revolutionary feelings. Everyone's face was filled with a happy smile.

The aircraft landed safely. Everyone was busy lifting the injured onto the car. Pilot Yu Bingxi hugged Zhang Zhongmin onto the ambulance. The pilots watched as the car quickly disappeared into the distance. However, the heroes' noble character would forever remain in their memory, forever inspiring them to move forward.

    难忘的航行
    ——记七五三六部队接送护井英雄
    八月八日早晨，中国人民解放军七五三六部队的两架直升飞机，披着朝霞，凌空而起，飞向东方。
    飞行员的心情，万分激动。因为，他们是去接送32111英雄钻井队的三位重伤员，到医疗条件更好的地方去治疗的。
        “红色航线”
    这是一次难忘的航行。
    他们要降落的地方，没有机场，没有导航设备，怎么办？飞行员们说：“最重要的准备是学习毛主席著作。用毛泽东思想领航，天大的困难也不怕。”大家反复学习毛主席的教导：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”五好飞行员赵从政说：“这些英雄，是毛泽东思想哺育起来的，我们热爱他们，就是热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱人民。我们能为英雄们早日恢复健康出力，就是最大的光荣。”人们把这次飞行，看作是彻底为人民服务的考验，是执行毛主席教导的考验，是对自己革命意志的考验。虽然要去的地方没有航线，但是，毛主席的教导，在飞行员心中划出了“红色航线”。在这条航线上飞行，永远胜利！
    大家精心地检查了飞机上的每一个机件、每一根管线、每一个接头和焊点。他们研究了机场不平坦时，如何降落，如何起飞，才能减少伤员的痛苦。他们尽量想到一切可能发生的问题，并且找到了解决问题的办法，才驾起飞机向目的地飞去。
          会见英雄
    飞机一着陆，飞行员不顾疲劳，马上赶到医院。他们还没有走进病房，一些轻伤的勇士已经出来欢迎了。勇士们高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“感谢党和毛主席的关怀！”飞行员们握住他们的手，激动得连一句话都说不出来。
    矿区副指挥兼总工程师张仲珉的伤势很重，只能坐在床上。他说：“感谢毛主席的关怀。我们今后一定更好地学习毛主席著作，向解放军学习，改造自己的思想，找出更多更大的油田气田。”
    冉树荣俯卧在床上，听说飞行员们来看他，高兴地说：“解放军同志，我看不见你们，我真想看看你们啊！”飞行员走到他跟前，弯下腰，挨着他的脸说：“我们要向你的英雄行为学习，一定像你那样，活学活用毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。”
      革命热情的交流
    飞机载着张仲珉、冉树荣、黄成厚三个英雄返航了。
    来的时候，为了准确、迅速，他们低空飞行，看着地面的目标前进。这样，机舱里的温度就高。往回飞的时候，飞行员考虑到温度高对伤员不利，让飞机尽量升高，使舱内的温度下降。
    飞行不久，天空出现了积云。飞行员立即想到，如果在云中飞行，飞机的震动就大，会增加伤员的痛苦。大家商量，决定使飞机爬到云层上去。
    飞机平稳地向前飞行，阳光把机舱里照得通亮。伤员要求看一看祖国的锦绣河山，飞行员和护士把伤员轻轻地扶起，大家透过机窗，眺望祖国美丽的大地。大家紧紧地靠在一起，革命的感情交流在一起，每个人的脸上都挂着幸福的笑容。
    飞机安全降落了。大家忙着把伤员抬上汽车。飞行员于炳燮把张仲珉抱上了救护车。飞行员们目送着汽车飞快地去远了。但是，英雄们的崇高思想品质，永远留在他们的记忆中，永远鼓舞他们前进。
