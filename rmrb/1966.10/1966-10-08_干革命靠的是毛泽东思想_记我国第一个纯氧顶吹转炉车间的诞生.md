	On the banks of the Huangpu River in Shanghai, a project of great significance to the development of China's steel industry—the country's first automated pure oxygen top-blown converter shop—has been completed. This is another great victory won by the heroic Shanghai working class under the banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Now, from a distance, one can see the towering factory buildings of this converter shop. Unlike ordinary steel mills, there are no yellow smoke billowing from its chimneys; the smoke from the converters is all purified. Inside the shop, workers sit in bright, clean glass instrument rooms, observing automatic instruments and controls, pressing buttons, and operating the entire set of massive, complex equipment. Once the molten iron is poured into the converter, a thick oxygen lance is inserted into the furnace, and a batch of steel is refined in a very short time.

	The completion of this important project, which represents the advanced level of the 1960s, is a great achievement of Shanghai's broad masses of workers who have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, transforming spiritual strength into material strength. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, said: "The imperialists are bullying us like this, and this needs to be seriously dealt with."

	In the previous few years, when our country decided to develop pure oxygen top-blown converters, the imperialists and modern revisionists did everything they could to obstruct us from mastering this new technology. The workers were filled with indignation, saying: The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionists think they can tie us up with "blockades," but this is just a pipe dream!

	Our great leader, Chairman Mao, taught us: "With one grain of rice and one ton of steel, everything will be fine." The Shanghai workers remember Chairman Mao's teachings. They said, in the past, we relied on Mao Zedong Thought to achieve great development in the steel industry. In the future, we will rely on Mao Zedong Thought to continuously reach new heights in technology. Dare we adopt new steelmaking technologies? This is about daring to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced technology levels, which is about daring to make a revolution. We must boost the morale of the Chinese working class, smash the arrogance of the imperialists, and smash the arrogance of the modern revisionists. What the Western bourgeoisie can do, the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought can do, and do even better!

	Conquering the technological fortress of the pure oxygen top-blown converter is not just an economic battle, but a political one! The Shanghai workers said, we do have many material and technical difficulties: no design experience, no experience in manufacturing such equipment, no technical data. But we have the most powerful ideological weapon, Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the source of our boundless strength and boundless wisdom. With this most powerful ideological weapon, we will definitely be able to reach the peak of science and technology. Chairman Mao said: "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." He also said: "The people have limitless creativity."

	When the design of the pure oxygen top-blown converter began, there was a fierce struggle between two lines of thought and two paths.

	The focus of the struggle was on two points: one was whether to be the master or the slave; the other was whether to follow revolutionary philosophy or the philosophy of crawling. In the end, it came down to one question: whether to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and promote the masses' spirit of initiative!

	At that time, some bourgeois technical "authorities" were intimidated by the mysterious foreign data and completely bowed down to imperialism. They said: "If we are to do it, we must do it according to the foreign model!" They were actually capitulationists. Some bourgeois technical "authorities" saw from foreign data that this furnace, if not handled properly, could cause explosions. They deliberately frightened people: "If the equipment and buildings are blown up, they can be rebuilt, but if people are blown up, it's not a joke!" Their conclusion was: this thing should not be touched!

	Other bourgeois technical "authorities" vigorously promoted the "philosophy of crawling," saying things like, "No experience, no data, and lack of instrument equipment... how can we do it?" They thought: according to the current domestic oxygen top-blown converters, with a little improvement, we can first produce the oxygen blowing part of the automated oxygen top-blown converter, which would be fine. As for realizing production automation control and other advanced equipment, we can leave it for later, slowly. If all the advanced equipment is put into operation at once, who knows when it will be completed. If we follow the opinions of these bourgeois technical "authorities," even if we build this converter, it will only have an ordinary technical level, still lagging far behind the world's advanced level; China's steel industry will still lag behind others.

	Chairman Mao's teachings on promoting the mass line and his wise decision to break the foreign framework and follow our own path of industrial development pointed the way forward for the workers. The workers and revolutionary technical personnel refuted the various fallacies of the bourgeois technical "authorities." "So many things are urgent; the world turns, time presses. A thousand years is too long, we must strive for every moment." The workers, with the spirit of "striving for every moment," dared to make a revolution, dared to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced technology, and decided to include a series of advanced equipment for the automated pure oxygen top-blown converter in the construction blueprint, taking a leap forward and quickly entering the world's advanced technological field.

	After the large pure oxygen top-blown converter shell was manufactured, it encountered unexpected difficulties in transportation. This shell is a gigantic object, weighing over twenty tons and as tall as a three-story building. Placing it on a flatbed truck for transportation from the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant, dozens of kilometers away, to the converter shop construction site, there were many power lines blocking the way, making it impossible to pass. The transportation workers measured the height of all the power lines along the route with bamboo poles and found that over a hundred power lines were blocking the large furnace body; these power lines belonged to different departments. On the day of transporting the furnace shell, the transportation workers and workers from more than ten departments were already waiting on the road. As soon as the transport truck arrived, they quickly climbed the poles and raised the power lines, allowing the furnace shell to pass smoothly.

	The wisdom of the revolutionary masses is something that those bourgeois technical "authorities" can never understand. Ensuring the quality of the recovered coal gas and preventing coal gas combustion is a major technical challenge, and abroad, a nitrogen curtain sealing method is used to solve it. This way, a large amount of nitrogen gas is consumed in production, wasting a lot of money. Our workers and technical personnel creatively used new technical methods and forged their own technological path. Just this one innovation saved tens of millions of yuan in investment for this large pure oxygen top-blown converter project. Chairman Mao said: "No matter who wants to understand anything, except to come into contact with that thing, that is, to live in (practice in) that environment, there is no way to solve it.... You want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality."

	Designing and building this pure oxygen top-blown converter had no experience, so what? The workers and technical personnel of Shanghai repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" and started with these two brilliant works. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, daring to practice and mastering this new thing through practice. The workers learned from the successful experience of manufacturing a 12,000-ton hydraulic press, first conducting scientific experiments on small equipment, and then gradually moving from small to large equipment for further experiments. They mastered the first-hand data from their own practice, unraveling the secrets of new technology and mastering the laws of science and technology. To solve the most critical technical problem of coal gas explosion, workers, designers, and revolutionary teachers and students from universities cooperated to first manufacture a 40-kilogram model furnace for experiments, initially exploring some rules of explosion. Then, they designed a 3.5-ton pure oxygen top-blown converter to further experiment and explore the possible causes of explosions. During the experiments, they followed Chairman Mao's instruction to be contemptuous of the enemy strategically and serious about the enemy tactically, combining the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and do with the most rigorous scientific attitude. Each experiment fully estimated the possibility of explosions and made necessary preparations, not fighting without preparation or without confidence. They were not afraid of explosions in their minds but strictly prevented explosions in their actions, finally understanding and mastering the laws of explosions, finding ways to prevent explosions, and solving the explosion problem.

	The smoke purification and recovery device of this 3.5-ton pure oxygen top-blown converter was designed by young designers with an average age of less than thirty, including draftsmen who had never done any design work before. They went deep into the field and combined with the workers and technical personnel of the factory. Their design started from practice. To design a machine or an instrument, they often needed to conduct hundreds of experiments. Experiment, fail, experiment again, until finally succeeding, they designed the entire system.

	After achieving success with the 3.5-ton furnace, workers and technical personnel immediately began designing and manufacturing large pure oxygen top-blown converters. From the 3.5-ton furnace to the large furnace, it was not a simple repetition and expansion in technology, but required solving many new technical problems through further practice. The data and technical materials accumulated on the 3.5-ton furnace were sometimes completely usable, sometimes needed to be changed according to new situations, and new laws needed to be explored and mastered.

	The large pure oxygen top-blown converter's giant furnace shell has a supporting ring outside weighing over seventy tons. This ring is so large that a ping-pong table can be placed inside for close-range rallies. Such a large component has very high precision requirements, especially the concentricity of the two holes at both ends of the ring. The workers of the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant fully utilized the experience of welding and machining large components of the 10,000-ton hydraulic press, summarized the methods of electric slag welding large components and "ant gnawing bone" machining, and manufactured the supporting ring with a concentricity difference of only half a hair, better than the design requirements.

	Relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, the workers successfully manufactured the automated large pure oxygen top-blown converter, once again demonstrating in practice the tremendous power of our own path of rapid, good, and economical technological development.

	From the 40-kilogram model furnace to the automated 3.5-ton pure oxygen top-blown converter to the automated large pure oxygen top-blown converter, the time spent was: three and a half months, five and a half months, and three months. This path fully illustrates that practice produces science, and the masses are the real authorities. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful force for the rapid, good, and economical development of science and technology.

	The Shanghai workers, who have already made great progress in practice, said: The large pure oxygen top-blown converter has been completed, but in the long run, this is still an experimental furnace, a new starting point.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "The objective world of reality is constantly changing and moving, and people's understanding of truth in practice is also constantly changing." The Shanghai workers follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continue to make revolutions, continue to advance, continue to practice, and strive to climb higher peaks to produce larger and more advanced pure oxygen top-blown converters for the country! Chairman Mao taught us: "The method of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy should not only be applied to the deployment of campaigns but also to the deployment of tactics."

	The automated pure oxygen top-blown converter was able to be completed at high speed and high quality because it followed Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy. When this great battle was being planned, people clearly recognized that they must use the strategic thought of concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy to guide them to reach the peak of world technology. Only by concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy can they be decisive, and only by concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy can they quickly occupy one technological peak after another. From an overall perspective, only by concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy can they quickly occupy one batch of new technological fields after another, rapidly changing the technological face of our country.

	Over 150 units participated in this great battle of the automated pure oxygen top-blown converter, including workers, engineering and technical personnel, PLA soldiers, students, teachers, scientific researchers, and cadres, totaling over 6,000 people. They promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. On the construction site, there was a magnificent scene of over 4,000 people engaged in three-dimensional cross-construction, from thirty meters high in the air to very deep underground foundations, layer upon layer of simultaneous construction of factory buildings and installation of equipment. In just three months, the installed equipment alone amounted to thousands of items, with a total weight of thousands of tons. Most of the main equipment was designed, manufactured, and installed for the first time. This construction project alone had an excavation volume of 52,000 cubic meters. The workers said: Without concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy, it is unimaginable that this giant project could be completed in just three months.

	Pure oxygen top-blown steelmaking is a complex comprehensive new technology. The relevant departments in Shanghai adopted the "divide and conquer" method of attack, breaking down many new technologies and new equipment problems into smaller parts, organizing forces from all sides and various experiences, concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy. Many originally complex technical problems became relatively easy to solve when divided and conquered by professionals familiar with the field. For example, dust prevention technology, which the metallurgical industry had less experience with, was more commonly used in the chemical industry. They drew on the experience of Shanghai's chemical industry and, based on the characteristics of steelmaking, made changes and developments, quickly overcoming the dust prevention technology problem in just a few months. The experience of this project proves that "divide and conquer" is a good method for annihilating the enemy on the industrial front, which can quickly integrate the latest technologies from all sides and apply them to key engineering projects.

	In the battle to conquer the pure oxygen top-blown converter, Shanghai workers and scientific and technical personnel paid great attention to tactical deployment. They also used the principle of concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy when solving each stage and each technical issue. The designers of the Shanghai Black Metallurgy Design Institute felt a mountain of difficulties when they first designed the smoke purification and recovery system, and they did not know where to start. They took their problems to study Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction." Chairman Mao said: "From this, it can be seen that in any process, if there are multiple contradictions, there must be one that is principal, playing a leading and decisive role, while others are in a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, when studying any process, if it is a complex process with two or more contradictions, one must use all efforts to find its principal contradiction. Once the principal contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved." Chairman Mao's teachings pointed the way forward for the designers. They overcame various difficulties, analyzed the internal connections between various difficulties, and finally found the principal contradiction in this design task. They immediately, together with more than ten units including the Shanghai Thermal Instrument Research Institute, Shanghai Chemical Research Institute, Shanghai Jiaotong University, and the Instrument Manufacturing Plant, held several technical meetings, concentrated the opinions of all sides, formulated a correct plan, and devoted all their efforts to solving this technical issue. Once this technical issue was overcome, many difficulties in the design of the smoke purification and recovery system were solved.

	The automated pure oxygen top-blown converter, equipped with new technology, was completed under the powerful impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It eloquently shows that the Chinese workers armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought dare to make revolutions and are good at making revolutions. They not only dare to destroy an old world but also know how to build a new world! The Shanghai working class is determined to forever follow the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and bravely advance, building our socialist motherland into an iron fortress of the proletariat!

    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想
    ——记我国第一个纯氧顶吹转炉车间的诞生
    在上海的黄浦江畔，对发展我国钢铁工业具有重要意义的一项工程——我国第一个采用新技术和自动化的纯氧顶吹转炉车间诞生了。这是英雄的上海工人阶级，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗所取得的又一重大胜利。
    现在，从远处就可以看到这个转炉车间高耸的厂房。它和普通的炼钢厂不同，烟囱不喷吐黄色的浓烟，转炉冒出的烟气都经过净化处理了。走进车间，只见工人们坐在明亮、洁净的玻璃仪表房里，观察着自动仪器、仪表，按动电钮，操纵着整套巨大、复杂的设备。铁水装进转炉后，很粗的喷氧管就插进炉膛，一炉钢在很短的时间内就炼好了。
    这个具有六十年代先进水平的重要工程项目的建成，是上海广大职工活学活用毛主席著作，把精神力量转化成物质力量的巨大成果。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。”
    前几年，当我国决定发展纯氧顶吹转炉的时候，帝国主义者、现代修正主义者千方百计地阻挠我们掌握这项新技术。工人们憋了一肚子怒气说：美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义集团妄想用“封锁”把我们捆住，这是白日做梦！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“一个粮食、一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了。”上海工人牢记着毛主席这一教导，他们说，过去，我们靠毛泽东思想，钢铁工业有了大发展，今后，我们靠毛泽东思想，一定能够不断攀登技术的新高峰。敢不敢采用炼钢新技术，就是敢不敢赶上和超过世界先进技术水平，也就是敢不敢革命。我们一定要大长中国工人阶级的志气，大灭帝国主义者的威风，大灭现代修正主义者的威风；西方资产阶级能够做到的事，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级也一定能做到，而且做得更好！
    攻克纯氧顶吹转炉这一技术堡垒，这不仅是一场经济仗，更是一场政治仗！上海工人说，我们在物质技术上的确有许多困难：没有设计经验，没有制造这种设备的经验，没有技术资料。但是，我们有伟大的毛泽东思想这一最强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想，是我们无穷的力量的源泉，是我们无穷的智慧的源泉。有了这一最强大的思想武器，我们一定能够攀登上科学技术的最高峰。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”又说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”
    当纯氧顶吹转炉开始设计的时候，两种思想、两条道路的斗争十分激烈。
    斗争的焦点有两个：一是做主人还是做奴隶；二是革命哲学还是爬行哲学。归根结蒂是一句话，是不是相信群众，依靠群众，发扬群众的首创精神！
    当时，一些资产阶级技术“权威”，被外国故弄玄虚的洋资料吓住了，完全拜倒在帝国主义的脚下。他们说：“要搞，就要照外国的样子搞！”他们实际上是取消派。有的资产阶级技术“权威”看到外国资料介绍说，这种炉子弄不好会引起爆炸。他们就故意吓唬人：“炸坏设备，炸坏建筑可以重来，炸坏了人，可不是玩的！”他们的结论是：这个东西碰不得！
    另一些资产阶级技术“权威”，拚命宣扬“爬行哲学”，说什么“一无经验，二无资料，三又缺乏仪表装备……怎么能搞起来？”他们认为：照国内现有的氧气顶吹转炉，稍加改进，先搞出自动化氧气顶吹转炉的氧气炼钢部分，就不错了。至于实现生产自动化控制和其它具有世界先进水平的装置，留到以后慢慢再说，如果所有的先进装置一齐上马，还不知道何年何月才算有个头。假如按照这些资产阶级技术“权威”的意见办，即使把这种转炉建设起来，也只有一般技术水平，和世界先进水平仍然相差一大截；我国的炼钢工业还是要落在别人后面。
    毛主席关于发扬群众路线的教导和关于打破洋框框、走自己工业发展道路的英明决策，给工人们指明了前进的方向。工人们和革命的技术人员们批驳了资产阶级技术“权威”的种种谬论。“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”工人们以“只争朝夕”的精神，敢于革命，敢于赶上和超过世界先进技术水平，决定把自动化纯氧顶吹转炉的一系列先进装置都安排在建设的蓝图上，一步登天，迅速跨进世界先进的技术领域。
    大型纯氧顶吹转炉的炉壳制造出来后，运输上遇到了意想不到的麻烦。这个炉壳是个庞然大物，它重达二十多吨，有三层楼房那么高。把它放在平台运输卡车上，从数十公里外的上海重型机器厂运到转炉车间工地，沿途有许多电线“挡驾”，无法通过。运输工人们用竹竿量遍了沿途所有电线的高度，发现有一百多条电线拦住了这个大炉体；而这些电线又分别属于不同的部门。运输炉壳的那一天，运输工人和十多个部门的工人，早就来到公路上等候着。运输的汽车一到，他们飞快地爬上电杆，架高了电线，让炉壳顺利地通过。
    革命群众的聪明智慧是那些资产阶级技术“权威”老爷们所根本不能理解的。保证回收的煤气质量，防止煤气燃烧，这是技术上一个大关键，在国外是采用一种氮幕封口的方法来解决的。这样，生产中就要消耗大量氮气，浪费大量费用。我国的工人和技术人员们创造性地运用了新的技术方法，走出了自己的技术道路。单这一项创造，在这座大型纯氧顶吹转炉的建设中，就节约了数十万元的投资。毛主席说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。……你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”
    设计和建设这座纯氧顶吹转炉，没有经验，怎么办？上海的工人们和技术人员们反复学习了毛主席的《实践论》和《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》依靠这两篇辉煌的著作起了家。他们按照毛主席的教导，勇于实践，在实践中认识和掌握这个新事物。工人们学习了制造一万二千吨水压机的成功经验，首先在小设备上打科学实验仗，再从小到大，在大设备上作进一步试验。他们从亲身的实践中，掌握了第一性资料，揭开了新技术的秘密，掌握了科学技术的规律。为了解决煤气爆炸这一最关键的技术难题，工人、设计人员和高等学校的革命师生合作，先制造了一座四十公斤的模拟炉进行试验，初步摸索到一些引起爆炸的规律。接着，他们又设计了一座三吨半的纯氧顶吹转炉，对可能发生爆炸的原因作了进一步的试验和摸索。在试验过程中，他们按照毛主席的在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人的伟大指示，把敢想敢干的革命精神和最严格的科学态度结合起来，每次试验，都对爆炸的可能性作了充分估计和必要的准备，不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗。他们思想上不怕爆炸，行动上严防爆炸，最后终于认识和掌握了爆炸的规律，找到了防止爆炸的办法，解决了爆炸问题。
    这座三吨半的纯氧顶吹转炉的烟气净化回收装置，是由平均年龄不到三十岁的青年设计人员们担任设计的，其中有从来也没有搞过设计的制图员。他们深入现场，和工厂的工人、技术人员相结合。他们的设计就是从实践开始的。为了设计一台机器，一个仪器，他们往往需要进行数百次试验。试验，失败，再试验，直到最后成功，终于把整个装置系统设计出来了。
    在三吨半炉子上取得成功经验后，工人、技术人员立即着手设计、制造大型纯氧顶吹转炉。从三吨半的炉子到大型炉子，在技术上不是简单的重复和扩大，还需要通过进一步的实践来解决许多新的技术难题。在三吨半炉子上积累的数据和技术资料，有的完全用得上，有的则需要根据新的情况加以改变，重新探索和掌握新的规律。
    大型纯氧顶吹转炉巨大的炉壳外面，有一个重达七十多吨的托圈。这个托圈很大，里面可以放上乒乓球台作近台对攻。这样大的部件，精度要求却很高，特别是托圈两端两个孔的同心度要求更高。上海重型机器厂的工人们，充分运用焊接和加工万吨水压机大部件的经验，又总结了电渣焊焊接大部件和“蚂蚁啃骨头”的加工方法，制造出来的托圈的同心度只差半根头发丝，比设计要求还好。
    工人们依靠伟大的毛泽东思想，制造成功自动化大型纯氧顶吹转炉，再一次在实践中显示出了我们自己的多快好省发展技术的道路的巨大威力。
    四十公斤模拟炉——自动化三吨半纯氧顶吹转炉——自动化大型纯氧顶吹转炉，它们所花费的时间是：三个多月——五个半月——三个月。这条道路充分说明，实践出科学，群众是真正的权威。毛泽东思想是多快好省发展科学技术的最强大的动力。
    已经在实践中取得了巨大进展的上海工人说：大型纯氧顶吹转炉干出来了，但从长远来说，这还是一个试验炉，是一个新的起点。
    毛主席教导我们：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”上海工人遵照毛主席的教导，还要不断革命，不断前进，不断实践，去攀登更高的险峰，为国家制造更大、更先进的纯氧顶吹转炉！毛主席教导我们：“集中优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人的作战方法，不但必须应用于战役的部署方面，而且必须应用于战术的部署方面。”
    自动化纯氧顶吹转炉所以能够高速度、高质量地建成，是贯彻执行毛主席的集中力量打歼灭战的伟大战略思想的结果。在酝酿这场大会战时，人们就明确地认识到，必须用集中力量打歼灭战的战略思想作指导，才能攀登世界技术高峰。只有集中力量打歼灭战，才能速决，才能用最快的速度，攻占一个又一个技术高峰。从整体来看，也只有集中力量打歼灭战，才能够多快好省地占领一批又一批新的技术领域，迅速改变我国的技术面貌。
    参加自动化纯氧顶吹转炉这场大会战的有一百五十多个单位，有工人、工程技术人员、解放军指战员、学生、教师、科学研究人员、干部等共六千多人。他们发扬了共产主义大协作精神。在建设工地上出现了四千多人进行立体交叉施工的宏伟场面，从三十多米的高空，到很深的地下基础，密密层层地同时建筑厂房和安装设备。在三个月内，单是安装的设备就有几千台件，总重量达数千吨。主要的设备都是第一次设计、制造和安装的。这项建设工程仅是挖土的工程量就达五万二千立方米。工人们说：不是集中力量打歼灭战，这个巨大工程在短短三个月内建成是不能想象的。
    纯氧顶吹炼钢是一项技术复杂的综合性新技术。上海有关部门采用了“分散难题，合力攻关”的作战方法，把许多新技术、新设备的难题，化整为零，组织各方面的力量和各方面的经验，集中力量打歼灭战。许多原来感到复杂的技术问题，一分散，分而食之，由熟悉这一行的专业人员分担，就变得比较容易解决。例如防尘技术，冶金工业部门经验比较少，化学工业部门在生产上就用得比较多。他们吸取了上海化学工业部门的经验，再根据炼钢工业的特点加以改变、发展，在短短的几个月内，就迅速攻下了防尘技术的难题。这个工程的经验证明，“分散难题，合力攻关”是工业战线上打歼灭战的好办法，它可以把各方面出现的最新技术综合起来，迅速地运用到重点工程项目上去。
    在攻克纯氧顶吹转炉这一大战役中，上海工人和科学技术人员很重视战术部署，他们在解决每一个阶段、每个技术课题时，也运用了集中力量打歼灭战的原则。上海黑色冶金设计院的设计人员开始设计烟气净化回收系统时，感到困难一大堆，而且都很棘手，头绪纷繁，不知道应该从哪里着手。他们带着问题学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》。毛主席说：“由此可知，任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”毛主席的教导给设计人员指明了前进的方向。他们排除各种困难，分析各种困难之间的内在联系，终于找出了这项设计任务中的主要矛盾。他们立即和上海热工仪表研究所、上海化工研究院、上海交通大学和仪表制造厂等十多个单位一起，开了几次技术会议，集中各方面的意见，制订了正确的方案，全力以赴，解决了这个技术课题。这个技术课题一攻克，烟气净化回收系统设计的许多困难就迎刃而解了。
    用新技术装备起来的自动化纯氧顶吹转炉，是在无产阶级文化大革命强有力地推动下建成的。它雄辩地说明，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人，敢于革命，也善于革命，他们既有无畏的革命气概，又有高超的革命艺术。他们不但敢于破坏一个旧世界，而且也善于建设一个新世界！上海工人阶级决心永远永远跟着伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席奋勇前进，把我们的社会主义祖国建设成为无产阶级铁打的江山！
