Albanian Premier Shehu held a banquet in Tirana on the evening of October 13 to warmly welcome the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Government Economic Delegation led by Vice Premier Le Quy. Albanian Party and government leaders Charcani, Balluku, Toska, Kaba, and others attended the banquet.

Shehu spoke at the banquet, saying that today, the Vietnamese issue is a touchstone to distinguish true friends of the Vietnamese people from enemies, and revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries. Modern revisionists have once again exposed themselves as traitors to the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries and close collaborators of U.S. imperialism in the imperialist aggression against Vietnam. Although the Soviet revisionist leaders have been deceiving people by shouting "united action" and "aiding the Vietnamese people," in fact, they are on the same front with the U.S. imperialists against the just cause of the Vietnamese people.

Shehu said that the policy adopted by the Soviet revisionists on the Vietnamese issue is mainly aimed at making the Vietnamese people surrender to the U.S. aggressors through "peace talks" and organizing a "fire encirclement" by the U.S. and the Soviet Union against People's China. Recently, Brezhnev's "lightning visit" to Tito and other revisionists, Gromyko's cordial meetings with Rusk and Johnson in New York and Washington, and the series of visits made by the Khrushchev revisionists to some Asian countries are all for this purpose.

Shehu said that U.S. imperialism is suffering more and more shameful defeats in Vietnam. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call has further strengthened the revolutionary spirit and unshakable determination of the Vietnamese people to carry the struggle through to the end.

Shehu said: The people's war being waged by the Vietnamese people shows to the peoples of all countries that imperialism, which appears to be "strong," is actually weak. This struggle once again proves another universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, that is, the fate of war does not depend on weapons but on people. The significance of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has gone beyond the borders of Vietnam. Their struggle is an example for the oppressed peoples and nations, a great contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of all countries, the cause of revolution, freedom, and independence, as well as the cause of true peace and socialism.

Shehu, in his speech, warmly praised the support of the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He said that great People's China has already given and is giving firm support and selfless, comprehensive aid to Vietnam. Great People's China is a strong, loyal, and reliable rear guard for the Vietnamese people. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the People's Republic of China is thoroughly loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and is ready at any time to join the battle to defend heroic Vietnam. The People's Republic of China is the strongest and most sincere supporter of the struggle of the oppressed peoples for freedom and independence, the number one enemy and main obstacle to U.S. imperialism and its lackey Soviet revisionism, and an invincible fortress of socialism.

Shehu said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people is also a struggle to defend the People's Republic of Albania. We are determined to provide all possible assistance to the Vietnamese people until the Vietnamese people achieve a complete victory over the U.S. aggressors. The assistance given by the Albanian people to the Vietnamese people is the internationalist duty of the Albanian people.

Shehu also enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China in his speech. He pointed out that this cultural revolution will forever eliminate all possibilities of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China. He said, our people and our party firmly believe that the seven hundred million Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, will advance victoriously on the road of socialist construction according to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and will never allow revisionism to emerge in China and the restoration of capitalism.

Le Quy, in his speech, pointed out that the U.S. government, in order to implement its two-pronged policy, while expanding the war of aggression, is also pushing the "peace talks" deception to cover up its barbaric crimes and deceive world public opinion and the American people. The U.S. imperialists think that by using force and deception, they can make the Vietnamese people submit to their position of strength and force the Vietnamese people to the negotiating table to accept their terms. But they are greatly mistaken. They cannot make us submit by military means, nor can they achieve this purpose by deception and conspiracy. The Vietnamese military and people unanimously and resolutely respond to Chairman Ho's great call on July 17 this year, determined to overcome all difficulties and achieve a complete victory over U.S. imperialism.

Le Quy said that the Vietnamese people have consistently received active support from the brotherly Albanian people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, have always upheld the spirit of proletarian internationalism and revolutionary combat unity, supporting the Vietnamese people in the past and now.

He said that this time, our delegation and the Albanian People's Republic Economic Delegation held talks on economic aid and cooperation in a brotherly friendly atmosphere. The talks were concluded in a short time and relevant agreements were signed. The assistance given by the Albanian Party of Labor and government to the Vietnamese people this time, like the assistance given in the past, not only greatly encouraged all the military and people of our country but also contributed to strengthening the friendship, combat unity, and brotherly cooperation between the two parties, the two peoples, and the two countries.

Newswire Tirana, October 14 - Albanian Party of Labor Central Committee First Secretary Enver Hoxha received the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation led by Le Quy, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Vice Premier of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic, on October 13.

Present at the reception were Hysni Kapo, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, Haxhi Toska, member of the Political Bureau and Deputy Premier of the Council of Ministers, and Foreign Minister Nasi Nasiu, among others.

Vietnamese Ambassador to Albania Nguyen Ngoc Thuan was also present at the reception.

    谢胡主席在欢迎越南政府经济代表团的宴会上指出
    苏修帮助美帝搞“和谈”骗局再次暴露叛徒面目
    黎清毅副总理赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民对越南人民的国际主义援助
    霍查同志接见黎清毅率领的越南政府经济代表团
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡十三日晚在地拉那举行宴会，热烈欢迎由越南民主共和国副总理黎清毅率领的越南民主共和国政府经济代表团。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人查尔查尼、巴卢库、托斯卡、卡博等出席了宴会。
    谢胡在宴会上讲话说，今天越南问题是区别越南人民的真正朋友和敌人，区别革命者和反革命者的试金石。现代修正主义者在帝国主义对越南的侵略中再一次暴露了他们做为各国人民自由和独立的叛徒、美帝国主义的密切合作者的真面目。苏联修正主义领导人尽管蛊惑人心地叫嚷“联合行动”，“援助越南人民”，但事实上他们是同美帝国主义者站在同一条战线上反对兄弟的越南人民的正义事业。
    谢胡说，今天苏联修正主义者在越南问题上所采取的政策，主要目的是通过“和谈”使越南人民向美国侵略者投降，并组织美苏反对人民中国的“火力包围圈”。最近勃列日涅夫在他的“闪电式旅行”中同铁托和其他修正主义者的会谈，葛罗米柯在纽约和华盛顿同腊斯克、约翰逊的亲切会晤，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在亚洲某些国家进行的一系列访问，都是为了这个目标。
    谢胡说，美帝国主义在越南正在遭到越来越大的可耻失败。胡志明主席的号召书更加加强了越南人民把斗争进行到底的革命精神和不可动摇的决心。
    谢胡说：越南人民正在进行的人民战争向各国人民表明，帝国主义貌似
  “强大”，而实际上是虚弱的。这个斗争再次证明了马克思列宁主义的另一个普遍真理，即战争的命运不取决于武器而是取决于人。越南人民英勇斗争的意义已经超越了越南的国界。他们的斗争是被压迫人民和民族的榜样，是对各国人民的反帝斗争事业，革命、自由和独立事业，以及真正和平与社会主义事业的一个巨大贡献。
    谢胡在讲话中热烈赞扬中国人民对越南人民抗美救国斗争的巨大支持。他说，伟大的人民中国已经给予并正在给予越南以坚决的支持和无私的、全面的援助，伟大的人民中国是越南人民的强大、忠实和可靠的后盾。在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下的中华人民共和国，彻底忠实于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则，随时准备投入保卫英雄越南的战斗。中华人民共和国是被压迫人民争取自由和独立斗争的最强大和最真诚的支持者，它是美帝国主义及其仆从苏联修正主义者的头号敌人和主要障碍，是社会主义不可摧毁的堡垒。
    谢胡说，越南人民的斗争也是保卫阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的斗争，我们决心尽我们的一切可能援助越南人民，直到越南人民取得彻底打败美国侵略者的胜利为止。阿尔巴尼亚人民给予越南人民的帮助是阿尔巴尼亚人民的国际主义义务。
    谢胡在讲话中还热情赞扬了中国无产阶级文化大革命。他指出，这场文化大革命将永远铲除在中国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的一切可能性。他说，我国人民和我们党深信，七亿中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，根据马克思列宁主义的教导，在社会主义建设的道路上胜利前进的时候，将永远不会允许在中国产生修正主义和使资本主义复辟。
    黎清毅在讲话中指出，美国政府为了实行它的两手政策，在扩大侵略战争的同时，又推行“和谈”骗局，以掩饰它的野蛮罪行，欺骗世界舆论和美国人民。美帝国主义者以为，采用武力和欺骗手段，就能使越南人民在他们的实力地位面前屈服，迫使越南人民坐到谈判桌上来，接受他们提出的条件。但是他们大错特错了。他们不能用军事手段使我们屈服，更不能用欺骗阴谋达到这一目的。越南军民一致坚决响应胡主席今年七月十七日发出的伟大号召，决心克服一切困难，直到取得对美帝国主义的彻底胜利。
    黎清毅说，越南人民在抗美救国斗争中一贯得到兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民的积极援助。阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志的领导下，发扬无产阶级国际主义和革命的战斗团结精神，过去和现在一贯支持越南人民。
    他说，这次我们代表团和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国经济代表团关于经济援助和合作的会谈，是在兄弟般的友好气氛中进行的，会谈在很短的时间内结束，并签订了有关协议。这次阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府给予越南人民的援助，同过去的援助一样，不仅大大地鼓舞了我国全体军民，而且为加强我们两党、两国人民和两国之间的友谊、战斗团结和兄弟合作作出了贡献。
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记恩·霍查，十三日接见了由越南劳动党中央政治局委员、越南民主共和国副总理黎清毅率领的越南政府经济代表团。
    接见时在座的有，阿劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记希·卡博、中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席哈·托斯卡、外交部长奈·纳赛等。
    接见时，越南驻阿尔巴尼亚大使阮玉山也在座。
