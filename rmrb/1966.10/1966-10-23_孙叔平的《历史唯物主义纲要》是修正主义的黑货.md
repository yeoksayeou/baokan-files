Jiang Zhengyan and Zong Yudong of the *New China Daily* published an article criticizing Jiangsu Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences Director Sun Chuping's book *Outline of Historical Materialism*. The article points out that Sun Chuping peddles a series of revisionist junk in this book.

Sun Chuping systematically propagates revisionist principles in the *Outline*, claiming that the "possibility of a 'parliamentary road' and 'peaceful transition' to socialism actually exists"; that "peaceful coexistence" is the "essence" of Marxism-Leninism, and that socialism can "defeat" capitalism in a "peaceful competition." He also says that in a socialist society, after the socialist transformation of ownership, classes no longer exist, and "a people's democracy" has emerged. The transition from socialism to communism "no longer requires a political revolution"; all that is needed is to "organize production and life" and strengthen the "material and technological foundation." These are all pure and unadulterated Khrushchev lines of abandoning world revolution and surrendering to imperialism and all reactionaries; they are lines of abolishing class struggle, proletarian dictatorship, and socialist revolution, thereby restoring capitalism.

The article points out: Khrushchev's revisionism was immediately countered by our Party with a principled struggle as soon as it was unveiled at the 20th Congress of the CPSU. In 1956, our Party published articles such as *On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat* and *On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Again*, which powerfully refuted Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies. However, Sun Chuping's *Outline* was published after these articles, and he continued to propagate "opposition to personality cult," "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "three reconciliations," and "two wholes." He also distorts and falsifies Marx and Lenin's revolutionary judgments to find theoretical grounds for Khrushchev's revisionism.

In 1960, the editorial department of *Red Flag* published articles such as *Long Live Leninism*. However, in the 1961 third edition of the *Outline*, Sun Chuping merely deleted Khrushchev's name and the lengthy quotations from Khrushchev and others, but retained the spirit of Khrushchev's revisionism. Under the guise of "comprehensive analysis," he continued to peddle fallacies such as "peaceful transition."

The Chinese people have grown up under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" attempt to use revisionist junk to deceive and corrupt the masses to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism, but they will not succeed.

### 孙叔平的《历史唯物主义纲要》是修正主义的黑货

    孙叔平的《历史唯物主义纲要》是修正主义的黑货
    南京《新华日报》发表江正言、宗宇东的文章，批判江苏哲学社会科学研究所所长孙叔平编写的《历史唯物主义纲要》一书。文章指出孙叔平在这本书中贩卖了一系列的赫鲁晓夫修正主义黑货。
    孙叔平在《纲要》中系统地宣扬修正主义的原则，他说什么通过“议会道路”“和平过渡”到社会主义的“可能性事实上是存在的”；“和平共处”是马克思列宁主义的“精髓”，社会主义在“和平竞赛”中可以“战胜”资本主义。他还说，在社会主义社会里，经过所有制的社会主义改造之后，阶级就不存在了，“出现了全民的民主”。社会主义向共产主义的过渡“不再需要政治革命”了，只要“组织生产和生活”，加强“物质技术基础”就行了。这都是地地道道的赫鲁晓夫的取消世界革命，向帝国主义和一切反动派投降的路线；是取消阶级斗争、无产阶级专政和社会主义革命，从而复辟资本主义的路线。
    文章指出：赫鲁晓夫的修正主义在苏共二十大刚出笼后，我党就对它进行了针锋相对的原则斗争。一九五六年我党发表了《关于无产阶级专政的历史经验》和《再论无产阶级专政的历史经验》等文章，都最有力地驳斥了赫鲁晓夫的修正主义谬论。而孙叔平的《纲要》是在这以后出版的，他仍旧大肆宣扬什么“反对个人迷信”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三和”、“两全”。他还歪曲和篡改马克思和列宁的革命论断，来为赫鲁晓夫的修正主义找理论根据。
    一九六○年，《红旗》编辑部《列宁主义万岁》等文章已经发表了。可是，一九六一年出版的《纲要》第三版上，孙叔平仅仅删掉了赫鲁晓夫的名字，删掉了原来抄引的大段大段赫鲁晓夫等的原话，仍保留了赫鲁晓夫修正主义的精神。他在“全面分析”的幌子下，继续兜售“和平过渡”等谬论。
    中国人民是在毛泽东思想的指导下成长起来的。资产阶级反动学术“权威”妄图用修正主义的黑货来欺骗群众，腐蚀群众，达到他们复辟资本主义的目的，那是办不到的。
