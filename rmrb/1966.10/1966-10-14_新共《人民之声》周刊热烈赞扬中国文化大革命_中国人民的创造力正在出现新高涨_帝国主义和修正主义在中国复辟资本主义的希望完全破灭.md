	New Zealand Communist Party's "People's Voice" Weekly Warmly Praises China's Cultural Revolution
	Chinese People's Creativity is on the Rise
	The Hope of Imperialism and Revisionism to Restore Capitalism in China is Completely Shattered

	BEIJING, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- WELLINGTON -- The New Zealand Communist Party's organ "People's Voice" Weekly published an article on Oct. 5, stating that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution "has extremely important significance for the Chinese people and the people of the whole world."

	The article was published to celebrate China's National Day. It pointed out that this year's National Day comes at a time when China is in the midst of a great proletarian cultural revolution. The article said: "In the past 17 years, the great achievements made by the Chinese people 'have been made under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great Marxist-Leninist thinker and revolutionary Mao Zedong.' Today, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao in the cultural revolution, the creativity of the Chinese people is surging to new heights." The article said that this revolution will further consolidate socialism, promote the great development of production, and change the face of all the people.

	The article sternly condemned the slander by imperialism and its followers, the Soviet revisionist leadership, against China's cultural revolution and the Red Guards who are at the forefront of this revolution. The article pointed out: "It is not surprising that imperialists and modern revisionists slander the Chinese people, because the cultural revolution has sounded the death knell for the hopes of imperialism and revisionism to restore capitalism in China through peaceful means or other means."

	The article concluded: "In its 17 years of existence, the People's Republic of China has proven to be the strongest supporter of the struggle of the oppressed revolutionary people of the world. Today, it stands as a base supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people against the aggression of American imperialism."

    新共《人民之声》周刊热烈赞扬中国文化大革命
    中国人民的创造力正在出现新高涨
    帝国主义和修正主义在中国复辟资本主义的希望完全破灭
    新华社十三日讯　惠灵顿消息：新西兰共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊五日发表文章指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命“对中国人民和全世界人民具有非常重要的意义”。
    这篇文章是为祝贺中国国庆而发表的。文章指出，中国今年的国庆是在中国正进行伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的时候到来的。文章写道：十七年来，中国人民取得的巨大成就“是在中国共产党和伟大的马克思列宁主义思想家和革命家毛泽东主席的领导下取得的。今天，在毛主席亲自领导的文化革命的促进下，中国人民的创造力正在出现新的高涨”。文章说，这场革命必将进一步巩固社会主义，促进生产的大发展和改变全体人民的面貌。
    文章严正谴责帝国主义及其追随者苏联修正主义领导集团对中国文化革命和站在这一革命最前列的红卫兵的诬蔑。文章指出：帝国主义者和现代修正主义者诬蔑中国人民“这是不奇怪的，因为文化革命给帝国主义和修正主义在中国用和平方式或其它方式复辟资本主义的希望敲响了丧钟。”
    文章最后说：“中华人民共和国在成立十七年当中，已经表明它是全世界被压迫的革命人民的斗争的最坚强的支持者。它今天作为支持战斗中的越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争的基地而屹立着。”
