Salute, the Red Capital

Over the past two months, our great capital has welcomed several million revolutionary students and teachers from all over the country. They spent an unforgettable time in Beijing: they saw our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, received the warm hospitality of the revolutionary people of Beijing, and learned many revolutionary experiences that cannot be learned in the classroom...

Revolutionary students and teachers from outside Beijing call this time spent in Beijing as "a lifetime of unforgettable days spent by the side of Chairman Mao," and "the best political lesson."

Many revolutionary students and teachers from outside Beijing wrote enthusiastic letters to our newspaper before and after leaving Beijing, recounting their experiences in Beijing. In these letters, they expressed their revolutionary passion and praised our great leader Chairman Mao, praised the great victory of the Cultural Revolution in the capital, and praised the revolutionary people of the capital who are advancing on the road to revolutionization. Today, we have selected four of these letters and published excerpts as follows.

Class Affection as Deep as the Sea

"From the grasslands to Tiananmen Square,
	Raise the golden cup and sing the song of praise;
	Thank the great Communist Party,
	Wish Chairman Mao eternal life."

Every time I sing this song, a warm current of happiness surges into my heart, and I can't help but recall the days in September in Beijing.

Soon after I arrived in Beijing, I unfortunately fell ill. At that time, the reception station arranged for me to stay at Taiping Lake Primary School. The teachers at the school knew I was sick and came to see me. Some immediately went out to call a doctor to treat me; others ran to a distant restaurant to buy noodles for me...

In the evening, the teachers from the school came to visit me again. They brought me hot water, asked about my condition, and what I needed, and comforted me to rest and recover. Later, they brought me a new, unused quilt to cover myself. The teachers' warm care and attention made me so moved that I was at a loss for words.

At midnight, two teachers came in, bringing me a hot bowl of ginger tea. I said excitedly, "You've gone to so much trouble." But they replied, "This is what we should do. We are all working together to carry out the Cultural Revolution. You are here as if you were at home."

I recovered in three days. During these three days, the teachers not only took care of me in every way like family, but also cared for my political progress, giving me Chairman Mao's works to study, and delivering the People's Daily and Guangming Daily for me to read every day.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." During my time in Beijing, I deeply felt that the revolutionary people of Beijing are indeed following Chairman Mao's words.

    敬礼，红色的首都
    最近两个月来，我们伟大的首都，接待了来自全国各地的几百万革命师生。他们在北京度过了一段难忘的日子：见到了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，受到了北京革命人民的热情接待，学到了许多在课堂上学不到的革命经验……
    外地的革命师生把这段在北京的日子，称为“在毛主席身边度过的毕生难忘的日子”，称为“最好的一堂政治课”。
    许多外地革命师生在离京前后，给本报写来了热情洋溢的信稿，记述了他们在北京的见闻。在这些信稿里，他们以满腔的革命激情，歌颂了我们的伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂了首都文化大革命的伟大胜利，歌颂了在革命化大道上前进的首都革命人民。今天，我们选了其中的四篇，摘要发表如下。
                ——编者
    阶级情意海样深
    “从草原来到天安门广场，
    高举金杯把赞歌唱；
    感谢伟大的共产党，
    祝福毛主席万寿无疆。”
    每当我唱起这支歌，一股幸福的暖流就涌进我的心房，不由得想起了九月间在北京的一段日子。
    我到北京不久，就不幸生病了。那时，接待站安排我住宿在太平湖小学。学校老师们知道我生病了，都跑来看我。有的马上出去请医生来给我看病；有的跑到很远的饭店里给我买来了面条……。
    晚上，学校老师们又来看望我。他们给我打来开水，问我病情怎样？需要些什么？并安慰我好好养病。后来，又送来了一床没有使用过的新花被子让我盖。老师们对我的热情关怀照顾，使我激动得热泪盈眶，不知说什么话好。
    半夜十二点钟，我正要入睡，又进来了两位老师，端着一碗滚热的姜汤让我喝。我激动地说：“太麻烦你们了”。可是她们却说：“这是我们应该做的。咱们都是为了搞好文化大革命嘛，你到我们这儿就像是回到你家里一样。”
    我病了三天就痊愈了。在这三天里，老师们不仅在生活上像亲人一样无微不至地关怀我，还从政治上关心我的进步，送给我毛主席著作学习，每天送给我《人民日报》和《光明日报》阅读。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”我在北京的这些日子里，深切感到，北京的革命人民就是按照毛主席的话做的。
