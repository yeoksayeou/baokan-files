In the past, there were no pine trees planted on the sand dunes. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions, dared to practice, and finally succeeded in planting the pine trees. This is truly,

    A red heart, green trees

    Nationally renowned forestry labor model and "soil expert" in afforestation, Tian Fu, following Chairman Mao's teachings, has made new achievements in forestry construction.

Chairman Mao said: Human beings must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress. The viewpoints of stagnation, pessimism, inaction, and self-satisfaction are all wrong. Tian Fu found the direction of progress from Chairman Mao's words. He thought: Socialism is constantly developing, and people's lives are constantly improving. Having only poplar and elm trees is not enough. If we can plant a grove of pine trees on these sand dunes, that would be wonderful! Thus, he made up his mind to let valuable tree species such as larch take root in the agricultural forestry brigade.

He shared this idea with the Party branch and all the commune members. Most people supported this suggestion. However, some people said: "Planting poplar or elm trees on the sand dunes is fine, but I've never heard of planting pine trees." Tian Fu thought, let's see what Chairman Mao says. He led all the commune members to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "No matter who wants to understand something, apart from coming into contact with that thing, that is, living (practicing) in that environment, there is no way to solve it." In the discussion, everyone said: "The road is walked by people, and trees are planted by people. In the past, there were no poplar trees on the sand dunes, but now there are, wasn't that because we planted them? If we don't plant the pine trees ourselves, when will we have pine trees? We should try planting them." Finally, everyone's thoughts were unified. This spring, he led the commune members to plant more than five thousand larch saplings on the sandy wasteland, and now the saplings have taken root.

When encountering problems, Tian Fu always looked for answers in Chairman Mao's works and then used Chairman Mao's words to persuade the masses. During the processing of mulberry seeds for germination, they failed twice. Some people thought they should not continue. Tian Fu said to everyone: "Didn't Chairman Mao tell us to learn from failures and turn failures into victories? It's a pity that the seeds are wasted, but if we find the reasons for the failure from these experiences, we can succeed." He led everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our morale." Everyone said: "Right, if we retreat after hitting a nail, how can we call it revolution? Failing once, we gain one experience; failing twice, we gain two experiences. We have failed twice, so we have experience. Let's try again, we can't give up." They then summarized the lessons from the two failures and conducted the third germination processing, which was successful. The commune members happily said: "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, they work wherever they are applied."

    过去沙坨子上没有栽过松树，我们听毛主席的话，勇于实践，终于把松树栽活了。这真是，
    心红树绿
    被人们誉为造林“土专家”的全国林业劳动模范田富，按照毛主席的教导，在林业建设上又做出了新的成绩。
    毛主席说：人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。田富从毛主席的话里找到了前进的方向。他想：社会主义建设不断发展，人民生活不断提高，光有杨树、榆树是不够的。我们这沙坨子上要栽上一片松树，那该多好！于是，他下定决心，要让落叶松等珍贵树种在农林大队安家落户。
    他把这个想法向党支部和全体社员说了，大多数人支持这个建议。也有个别人说：“沙坨子上栽棵杨树、榆树还行，没听说还能栽松树。”田富想，还是看看毛主席怎样说的。他领着全体社员学习了毛主席语录：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”在讨论中，大家说：“路是人走的，树是人栽的，从前沙坨子上没有杨树，现在有了，那还不是我们栽上去的？要不亲手栽松树，什么时候咱也不会有松树，得栽栽看。”最后大家思想统一了。今年春天，他带领社员，在沙荒地上栽了五千多棵落叶松，现在松苗已经成活。
    遇到问题，田富总是到毛主席著作里去找答案，然后用毛主席的话去说服群众。在作桑子催芽处理时，两次都失败了。有人认为不能再搞了。田富对大伙说：“毛主席不是告诉我们要从失败中吸取教训，变失败为胜利吗？种子瞎了是可惜，但咱们从失败中找找原因，就可以搞成。”他又领导大家学习了毛主席语录“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”大伙说：对呀，碰个钉子就回头，怎能算干革命呢？失败一次，就会长一次见识，咱们失败两次就有经验了，再干，不能撂挑子。接着，他们从两次失败中总结了教训，做第三次催芽处理，果然取得成功。社员们高兴地说：“毛主席的话句句是真理，用到那里那里灵。”　（富集文）
