Chairman Ho Chi Minh denounces U.S. imperialist plot to further expand the war
Reaffirms Vietnamese people's resolve to endure hardships and sacrifices and determination to defeat U.S. aggressors

	HANOI, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) - According to local newspapers, Chairman Ho Chi Minh recently spoke at a competition meeting of the Vietnamese People's Public Security Armed Forces in Hanoi. He emphasized, "The Vietnamese people must unite as one, fear no hardships, fear no sacrifices, and are determined to defeat the American aggressors. The enemy will surely fail. The Vietnamese people will surely win."

	Chairman Ho denounced the U.S. imperialists' plot to further intensify and expand the war. He said, "The American aggressors are suffering heavy defeats in both North and South Vietnam. The more defeats they suffer, the more desperately they struggle. They are sending large numbers of troops to the South, madly bombing the North, and at the same time, they are vigorously engaging in political and diplomatic activities, shouting lies about 'peace' in the United Nations, and convening a seven-nation conference in the Philippines, and so on."

	Chairman Ho said, the heroic people of the South have fought well and achieved great victories. In the six months from April to September, they annihilated 21 enemy battalions. The people of the North have also shot down 1,500 American aggressor planes. In this great victory, the public security forces have made their own contributions.

	The meeting summarized the achievements of the Vietnamese People's Public Security Armed Forces in the past two years of anti-American, national salvation competitions.

	At the meeting, the representative of the Public Security Department read the decision of the Vietnamese Government meeting approving 176 units as "Decisive Units of 1965" and presented medals issued by the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly to various advanced units.

	In a resolution to the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, and Chairman Ho, the meeting expressed its determination to do better and more outstanding work in public security and defense; to fight side by side with the broad masses of soldiers and people, and to strive for the final victory in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    胡志明主席谴责美帝进一步扩大战争的阴谋
    重申越南人民不怕艰苦牺牲  决心战胜美国侵略强盗
    新华社河内二十二日电　据这里的报纸报道：越南民主共和国主席胡志明最近在越南人民公安武装力量在河内举行的竞赛大会上发表讲话时强调：“越南人民要团结一致，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。”“敌人一定失败。越南人民一定胜利。”
    胡主席谴责美帝国主义正在阴谋进一步加强和扩大战争。他说：“美国强盗正在越南北、南两方遭到惨败。它越遭到惨败，就越拚命挣扎。它大规模向南方增兵，疯狂地轰炸北方，同时，竭力进行政治和外交活动，在联合国大肆叫嚷骗人的‘和平’，在菲律宾召开七国会议等等。”
    胡主席说，英雄的南方军民打得好，取得了巨大胜利。从四月份到九月份的六个月中，总共歼灭敌人二十一个营。北方军民也已把一千五百架美国强盗飞机打得粉身碎骨。在这个大胜利中，人民公安作出了自己的贡献。
    这个大会，总结了全越南北方人民公安武装力量两年来展开抗美救国竞赛所取得的巨大成绩。
    在大会上，公安部代表宣读了越南政府会议批准一百七十六个单位为一九六五年“决胜单位”的决定，并把越南国会常务委员会颁发的勋章授予各个先进单位。
    大会在给越南劳动党中央、政府和胡主席的决心书中表示要把治安、保卫工作搞得更好，更出色；要同广大军民并肩战斗，争取抗美救国斗争的最后胜利。
