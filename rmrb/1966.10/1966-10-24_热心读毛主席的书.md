	Eagerly Reading Chairman Mao's Book

	An elderly sailor, around fifty years old, spent a long time attentively reading the Chinese version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" at the China Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Kyushu, Japan. The sailor told a Chinese reporter that he had started studying the Japanese version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" more than a year ago. He said, "Mao Zedong's books are most useful to us and easiest to understand. In the most difficult times of the revolution, Mao Zedong and many Chinese revolutionaries endured countless hardships and persevered to pioneer the revolutionary cause. When I began reading Chairman Mao's early works, I was deeply moved by this spirit."

	During his conversation with the Chinese reporter, the sailor specially wrote down a few sentences in his not-so-fluent Chinese to express his feelings: "I hope for friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Japan. We respect Teacher Mao Zedong. Long live Mao Zedong! Long live the unity and friendship between China and Japan!"

    热心读毛主席的书
    一位年约五十多岁的老船员，在日本九州举行的中国经济贸易展览会上长时间地聚精会神地阅读《毛泽东选集》中文版。这位老船员告诉中国记者说，他是一年多以前开始学习《毛泽东选集》日文版的。他说：“毛泽东的书对我们最有用处，又最容易懂。在革命最困难的时候，毛泽东和中国许多革命家尽了千辛万苦，百折不挠地去开拓革命大业。当我开始读毛主席早期著作时，就为这种精神深深感动了。”这位老船员在同中国记者谈话时，特地用不大熟练的中文写下了几句话，来表达自己的心情：“我希望中日两国人民友好和团结，我们尊敬毛泽东老师。毛泽东万岁！中日友谊团结万岁！”
