Friends, experts, and students from various countries, together with the people of the capital, enthusiastically celebrated China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test, hailing it as another brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the early hours of the 28th, after the joyous news was broadcast, many foreign friends were too excited to sleep. Some jumped out of bed and immediately called their friends to share the good news. Some foreign friends tightly grasped the hands of their Chinese comrades, tears of excitement in their eyes, and together they shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang "The East is Red."

Not long after the inspiring news was broadcast, a delegation of 23 friends from 14 countries, including Albania, Vietnam, Belgium, Britain, Australia, Canada, Spain, Azania, Tanzania, New Zealand, Sudan, Haiti, the United States, and Peru, braved the night's chill to rush to the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao and the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and shouted to the revolutionary masses of the capital in Chinese, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" Many friends tightly grasped the hands of the reception station staff, excitedly saying, "Your achievements have inspired the people of the world. We are so excited. Thank you, dear Chairman Mao. Thank you, the Chinese people."

The news of this test greatly inspired the Vietnamese comrades from the front lines of the anti-American struggle. The deputy head of the Vietnamese government's economic delegation, Li Ban, and other members of the delegation visited relevant departments in China on the morning of the 28th to extend their warm congratulations. Li Ban said, "China's new achievements in nuclear weapon testing not only have great significance for defending Chinese territory but also provide great support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation."

Albanian friend Kimiter told the reporter with excitement, "Under the leadership of the glorious, correct, and great Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved this great victory, which makes me feel very proud and honored. The great victory of the Chinese people is also our great victory."

Yemeni friend Salah Dahhan, who had previously composed a poem to celebrate China's successful detonation of its first atomic bomb, could not contain his joy upon hearing the news. He told the reporter, "This is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of the Chinese people studying and applying Chairman Mao's works."

Malaysian friend Lin Jianzong said, "China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test is a heavy blow to the nuclear blackmail and monopoly policies of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism." Cameroonian student Musong said, "Chairman Mao pointed out that if the enemy sharpens his knife, we should also sharpen ours. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are developing nuclear weapons not only for the security of China but also for the security of all oppressed peoples around the world."

Belgian expert Bei Hu said, "People armed with Mao Zedong Thought will have a great spiritual force and can create miracles. We have further understood the great significance of studying Mao Zedong Thought from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the great achievements the Chinese people have made this time."

A Peruvian friend also celebrated this great victory with the people of the capital. He said, "The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the Latin American people. This victory has inspired the people of Latin America and all oppressed and exploited countries in the world, strengthening their fighting spirit."

On the 28th, Spanish expert Simeniz from the Central Committee's Translation Bureau came twice to the reception station of the Central Committee to congratulate China on the successful missile and nuclear weapon test. He shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

    来自世界各国的朋友为我国新胜利热烈欢呼
    毛泽东思想武装起来的人民能创造一切奇迹
    据新华社二十九日讯　来自世界各国的朋友、专家和留学生，同首都人民一起，热烈欢呼我国发射导弹核武器试验成功，欢呼毛泽东思想的又一辉煌胜利。
    二十八日凌晨，当喜讯广播以后，不少外国朋友兴奋地睡不着觉，有的人从床上跳了起来，立即把这个好消息用电话告诉自己的朋友，有些外国朋友紧紧地握着中国同志的手，含着激动的泪花，和中国同志一起一遍一遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！”高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    振奋人心的消息刚刚广播不久，由阿尔巴尼亚、越南、比利时、英国、澳大利亚、加拿大、西班牙、阿扎尼亚、坦桑尼亚、新西兰、苏丹、海地、美国、秘鲁等十四个国家的二十三位外国朋友组成的报喜队，迎着深夜的寒风，赶到中共中央和国务院的群众接待站，他们高举着毛主席画像和红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，向前来贺喜的首都革命群众用中国话高呼“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”许多朋友紧紧握着接待站工作人员的手激动地说，你们的成就鼓舞了全世界人民，我们太兴奋了，感谢敬爱的毛主席，感谢中国人民。
    这次试验的喜讯，极大地鼓舞了来自反美斗争前线的越南兄弟。正在北京的越南政府经济代表团副团长李班和代表团其他成员，二十八日上午欢欣鼓舞地到我国有关部门热烈祝贺。李班说：“中国在试验核武器方面的新成就，不仅对保卫中国国土有巨大意义，而且对越南人民的抗美救国斗争也是巨大支持。”
    阿尔巴尼亚朋友基米特尔怀着激动的心情对记者说，中国人民在以毛主席为首的光荣、正确、伟大的中国共产党领导下，取得的这一巨大成就，使我感到很光荣和很自豪。中国人民的伟大胜利，也是我们的伟大胜利。
    也门朋友萨利赫·达汉在我国第一颗原子弹爆炸成功的时候，曾激动地赋诗欢呼。这次他听到喜讯后，抑制不住喜悦心情向记者说，这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是中国人民活学活用毛主席著作的成果。
    马来亚朋友林建宗说，中国发射导弹核武器试验成功，对美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的核讹诈和核垄断政策是个迎头痛击。喀麦隆留学生木松说，毛主席指出，敌人磨刀我们也磨刀。中国人民在毛主席的领导下发展核武器，不仅是为了中国的安全，也是为了全世界被压迫人民的安全。
    比利时专家贝湖说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就会有一个巨大的精神力量，创造出一切奇迹。我们从中国的文化大革命中，从中国人民这次取得的巨大成就中，进一步理解到学习毛泽东思想的伟大意义。
    一位秘鲁朋友也同首都人民一起欢庆这一伟大胜利。他说，中国人民的这一胜利，就是拉丁美洲人民的胜利。这一胜利鼓舞了拉丁美洲和全世界一切受压迫被剥削国家的人民，增强了他们斗争的勇气。（附图片）
