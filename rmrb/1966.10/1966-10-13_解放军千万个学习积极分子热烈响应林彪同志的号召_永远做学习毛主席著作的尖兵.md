	Millions of PLA Study Activists Eagerly Respond to Comrade Lin Biao's Call
	Forever Be the Vanguard in Studying Chairman Mao's Works

	Xinhua News Agency, October 12th—In recent days, millions of PLA activists who study Chairman Mao's works have, while earnestly studying Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, unanimously declared: We must steadfastly follow the direction pointed out by Comrade Lin Biao, further study for the revolution, with deep proletarian feelings, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, raise it to a new level, and redouble our efforts to lead the new stage of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

	Many units' activists studying Chairman Mao's works said, Comrade Lin Biao is the closest comrade-in-arms and best student of the great leader Chairman Mao. He sees far, thinks deeply, and grasps accurately. Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage is a new call to arms for the army on the path of extremely proletarian and extremely militarized construction, pointing the way for the entire army to march forward with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought held even higher.

	In their enthusiastic study and discussion of Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, they unanimously agreed that in the future, they must strictly adhere to the high standards set by Comrade Lin Biao. First, they must clarify the purpose of studying Chairman Mao's works, which is to study for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Rosong Leshan, an activist studying Chairman Mao's works in the Wuhan unit, said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "We study Marxism-Leninism not for show, nor because it has some mystery, but because it is the science that leads the proletarian revolutionary cause to victory." Chairman Mao's books are the science of revolution, the most practical Marxism-Leninism. We strive to study Chairman Mao's works to forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. I am engaged in logistics work. Every time I allocate funds, I always consider "saving every copper coin for the war and revolutionary cause." In terms of ideological reform, I always think of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, being a faithful servant of the people. Feng Fusheng, a political instructor in a certain unit of the Air Force on the Fujian front, said: "In the past, I was a cook. I studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution in the kitchen. Now, as a political instructor, I must strive even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, leading the company to win battles in ideological revolutionization." Qu Jianwen, the former squad leader of the squad where Lei Feng served, said: "Lei Feng became a great communist warrior because he truly understood 'In Service of the People,' dedicating his limited life to the endless service of the people. I will definitely take Lei Feng as an example and truly master Mao Zedong Thought." Xue Huilan, a five-star soldier and activist studying Chairman Mao's works in the Lanzhou unit, spoke about his experience of studying for the revolution, saying: "In the first two years after enlisting, I did not gain much from studying Chairman Mao's works because I did not dare to reveal my thoughts and cut off my tail. Later, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, I worked hard on studying 'the three articles,' fighting against selfish thoughts, and the more I studied, the more I progressed. I was evaluated as a five-star soldier for three consecutive years. I will resolutely carry out Comrade Lin Biao's new instructions and forever be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

	Many activists studying Chairman Mao's works, in their study of Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, talked about another experience: One must have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and an infinite loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, with very deep proletarian feelings, to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Ye Zhongyang, a first-class meritorious soldier and deputy political instructor in a certain unit of the Fuzhou unit, comes from a poor family. Chairman Mao saved his family of nine, and Mao Zedong Thought nurtured him into a soldier of the people. He has a particularly deep sense of gratitude towards Chairman Mao, reading Chairman Mao's books with deep class feelings. He is fearless in his struggle against the enemy. He said: "I am not afraid of sacrificing myself in the frontline struggle against the enemy. This is completely because Mao Zedong Thought made me understand that revolutionaries must be brave people." Tang Huosheng, a squad leader in a certain unit of the Beijing Guard, recently saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square and participated in the Beijing unit's conference of activists studying Chairman Mao's works. He said: "I grew up under the sun and rain of Chairman Mao. In the old society, my family had no house and no land, generation after generation working for the landlord, living a life worse than cattle and horses. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering and made us masters of the state. Chairman Mao's books are the books for the poor to rise up and make revolution. I will read his old man's books well, never forget the bitterness of class struggle, and defend the ironclad socialist mountains and rivers."

	Many activists studying Chairman Mao's works, with revolutionary enthusiasm, expressed their determination on how to work hard on studying, how to study and apply in the struggle.

	Chairman Mao said: "The enemy of study is one's own satisfaction. To seriously study something, one must start from not being satisfied with oneself." The activists studying Chairman Mao's works unanimously declared that they will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, never stagnate, continue to improve, continue to develop, forever be the vanguard in studying Chairman Mao's works, and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

    解放军千万个学习积极分子热烈响应林彪同志的号召
    永远做学习毛主席著作的尖兵
    新华社十二日讯　连日来，中国人民解放军千万个学习毛主席著作积极分子，在热烈学习林彪同志指示时，一致表示：一定要坚定不移地朝着林彪同志指引的方向，进一步为革命而学，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情而学，真正把毛泽东思想学到手，提高到新的水平，加倍努力走在活学活用毛主席著作群众运动新阶段的前列。
    许多部队学习毛主席著作积极分子说，林彪同志是伟大领袖毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生，站得高，看得远，想得深，抓得准。林彪同志把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的指示，是对部队在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化建设的道路上，发出的新的动员令，给全军指明了更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的方向。
    他们在热烈地学习讨论林彪同志的指示时，一致认为，今后要不折不扣地做到林彪同志提出的高标准，首先要明确学习毛主席著作的目的，就是为中国革命和世界革命而学。武汉部队学习毛主席著作积极分子宋乐山说，毛主席教导我们：“我们学马克思列宁主义不是为着好看，也不是因为它有什么神秘，只是因为它是领导无产阶级革命事业走向胜利的科学。”毛主席的书就是革命的科学，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，我们努力学习毛主席著作，就是为了永远跟着毛主席闹革命。我是做后勤工作的，每开支一笔经费，总是考虑到“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”，在思想改造上，总是想到“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务，做人民的忠实勤务员。福建前线空军某部指导员、学习毛主席著作积极分子丰福生说：“我过去当炊事员，学习运用毛泽东思想，在炊事房里闹革命，现在当指导员，更要努力活学活用毛主席著作，领导连队在思想革命化上打胜仗。”雷锋生前所在班班长曲建文说：“雷锋所以能够成为伟大的共产主义战士，就是因为他真正学懂了《为人民服务》，把自己的有限生命投入到无限的为人民服务之中。我一定以雷锋为榜样，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。”兰州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士薛惠兰在谈到为革命而学的体会时，他说：“入伍的头两年学习毛主席著作收获不大，就是因为不敢亮思想，割尾巴，后来根据林彪同志的指示，在用字上狠下功夫，反复学习‘老三篇’，狠斗私心杂念，越学越进步，连续三年被评为五好战士。我要坚决执行林彪同志的新指示，永远做毛主席的好战士。”
    许多学习毛主席著作积极分子在学习林彪同志指示中，谈到的另一个体会是：一定要无限的热爱毛主席，无限的忠于毛泽东思想，怀着非常浓厚的无产阶级感情，才能真正把毛泽东思想学到手。福州部队一等功臣、某部副指导员叶中央出身贫苦家庭，是毛主席救了他一家九口人，是毛泽东思想哺育他成长为人民战士，他对毛主席的恩情感受特别深，读毛主席的书阶级感情特别深，他在对敌斗争中英勇无畏。他说：“我在前线对敌斗争不怕牺牲，这完全是毛泽东思想使我懂得了干革命要做勇敢的人。”北京警卫部队某部班长唐火生，前不久在天安门前见过最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，还参加了北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会。他说：“我是在毛主席的阳光雨露下长大的，在旧社会，我家房无片瓦，地无半垄，祖祖辈辈给地主扛长活，过着牛马不如的生活，是毛主席从苦海里把我们救出来，成了国家主人。毛主席的书，就是我们穷人翻身闹革命的书，我要好好读他老人家的书，永远不忘阶级苦，保卫社会主义铁打的江山。”
    许多学习毛主席著作积极分子还满怀革命激情，表示了今后怎样在用字上狠下功夫，怎样在斗争中学，在斗争中用等方面的决心。
    毛主席说：“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。”学习毛主席著作积极分子们，一致表示要遵循毛主席的教导，决不停滞不前，要继续提高，继续发展，永远做学习毛主席著作的尖兵，永远做毛主席的好战士。
