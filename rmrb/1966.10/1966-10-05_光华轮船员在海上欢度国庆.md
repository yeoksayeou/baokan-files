The entire crew of the Guanghua Ship held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on the morning of October 1st in the waters of the Belawan Port in Medan, Indonesia, to enthusiastically celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The solemn five-star red flag was raised to the top of the mast at 8 AM on October 1st to the accompaniment of the national anthem. At this moment, all crew members, dressed in clean white sailor uniforms, stood solemnly on the deck, saluting the flag with their eyes. The entire ship was adorned with strings of colorful flags fluttering in the wind, presenting a festive scene.

After the flag-raising ceremony, the crew members gathered in front of the loudspeaker to listen to the live broadcast of the national day celebrations in the capital. When they heard that our most respected and great leader Chairman Mao was ascending the Tiananmen Gate to the solemn melody of "The East Is Red," the crew members, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," joined the 150 million revolutionary masses in front of Tiananmen and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    光华轮船员在海上欢度国庆
    据新华社四日讯　光华轮消息：光华轮的全体船员一日清晨在印度尼西亚棉兰勿拉湾港口海面上举行隆重的升旗仪式，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年。
    庄严的五星红旗一日上午八时在国歌声中升上光华轮的旗杆顶。这时，全体船员穿着洁白的海员服肃立在甲板上，向国旗行注目礼。全船一串串彩旗迎风飘扬，呈现着节日的景象。
    升旗仪式结束后，船员们又聚集在扩音器前收听祖国首都举行国庆盛典的实况广播。当他们听到我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在《东方红》的庄严乐曲声中登上天安门城楼的时候，船员们举着《毛主席语录》，和天安门前的一百五十万革命群众一起欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
