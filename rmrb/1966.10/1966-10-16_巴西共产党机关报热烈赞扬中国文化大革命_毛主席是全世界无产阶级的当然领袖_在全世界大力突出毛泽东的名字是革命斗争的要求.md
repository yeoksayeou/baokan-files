	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, a message from Rio de Janeiro states: The Brazilian Communist Party's organ, "The Worker's Class Newspaper," recently published an article enthusiastically praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and hailing Chairman Mao as the "natural leader of the world's proletariat."

	The article states, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a movement of great significance for the destiny of world socialism." "The Chinese Communist Party and its outstanding leader, Mao Zedong, have led a historic transformation within their country, demonstrating great wisdom."

	The article states, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not just a matter for China. It will undoubtedly have an impact everywhere. It is an important aspect of the great struggle against modern revisionism, a strong wind that will awaken everything, and it will eliminate the opportunistic poison that has affected almost all workers' ranks. It will guide the working people onto a new path of brightness."

	When discussing the slander by modern revisionists centered around the leadership of the CPSU against China's Cultural Revolution, the article says: "Soviet publications have shamelessly compared the Chinese Red Guards to the police of the old Russian tsarist era. This absurd accusation against Chinese youth is actually a perfect portrayal of the CPSU leaders themselves. Those who, in front of the U.S. embassy in Moscow, used unprecedented barbaric methods to suppress student demonstrations protesting against U.S. aggression in North Vietnam, are truly acting like tsarist police."

	The article states, "The CPSU leaders slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China because: 'The CPSU leaders are afraid that a mass movement like the one currently being carried out in China will also emerge in the Soviet Union. If such a thing happens, they will be finished, they will be overthrown, and the Soviet Union will return to the revolutionary path.'"

	The article emphasizes, "The Chinese Communist Party has set a brilliant example for us on how to learn from the masses and correctly lead the masses. Its attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a model of correct party-mass relations. This is the application of Mao Zedong's mass line at a new level, and this line is being proven by reality."

	The article states, "Imperialists, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionists are still frantically attacking the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, because 'Mao Zedong is the embodiment of the great thought that can lead the people of all countries to complete liberation today. Throughout history, the most outstanding leaders of the proletariat have all been subjected to the beastly hatred of reactionary forces and reformists. Marx and Engels suffered endless insults from revolutionary enemies. No one has been attacked and cursed more fiercely by international reactionaries and socialist traitors than Lenin.'"

	The article states, "So far, no great struggle on a large scale has been possible without a tested, respected, and authoritative leader. The proletariat not only has its own national leaders but also has leaders on a global scale."

	The article emphasizes, "Undoubtedly, at present, due to Mao Zedong's courage, his revolutionary firmness, his experience, and his political foresight, he is the natural leader of the world's proletariat. He is the symbol of the uncompromising struggle against American imperialism and for the victory of socialism in all countries of the world. He leads the main stronghold of the world revolution, leading a country of 700 million people who bravely fight against the warmongers of the United States. He is the banner-bearer of the great struggle to defend the invincible principles of Marxism-Leninism against modern revisionism. Whether in China or throughout the world, it is a requirement of the revolutionary struggle to prominently feature the name of Mao Zedong."

	The article continues, "The dissemination and study of Mao Zedong Thought is a necessity for all those who support the revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is nothing but Marxism-Leninism applied to our contemporary era. This leader of the Chinese Communist Party creatively applies the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism to the practice of the Chinese revolution, enriching and continuing to enrich the powerful proletarian doctrine. His thought illuminates the path for those struggling for national liberation, people's democracy, and socialism. Spreading this thought among the masses is to promote the revolution."

    巴西共产党机关报热烈赞扬中国文化大革命
    毛主席是全世界无产阶级的当然领袖
    在全世界大力突出毛泽东的名字是革命斗争的要求
    据新华社十五日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西共产党机关报《工人阶级报》最近刊登一篇文章，热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命，称颂毛主席是“全世界无产阶级的当然领袖”。
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是“一个对世界社会主义命运有极其重大意义的运动”。“中国共产党及其杰出的领袖毛泽东领导了在他们国内进行的历史性变革，表现了巨大的智慧”。
    文章说：“无产阶级文化大革命并不是只限于中国范围的事情。它肯定会在一切地方发生影响。这是反对现代修正主义的伟大斗争的一个重要方面，是促使万物苏醒的劲风，它将从工人运动中清除影响到几乎所有工人队伍的机会主义的流毒。将引导劳动人民走上新的光明大道。”
    文章谈到以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者对中国文化大革命大肆诬蔑时说：“苏联报刊居然无耻地把中国红卫兵比作旧俄沙皇时代的警察。这种对中国青年的荒唐指责，恰好是苏共领导人自己的绝妙写照。那些在莫斯科美国大使馆门前以闻所未闻的野蛮手段镇压抗议美国侵略越南北方的学生示威的人，才真是和沙皇警察的行径一模一样。”
    文章说，苏共领导人诬蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是因为：“苏共领导人害怕在苏联也出现像中国目前正在开展的群众运动。如果发生这样的事，他们就算完了，他们就会被赶下台，苏联就会重新走上革命的道路。”
    文章强调指出：“中国共产党为我们作出了怎样向群众学习和正确领导群众的光辉榜样。它对无产阶级文化革命运动的态度，是正确的党群关系的典范。这是毛泽东制订的群众路线在新的水平上的运用，这条路线正得到现实生活的证实。”
    文章说，帝国主义者、各国反动派和现代修正主义者，还拚命地攻击中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东，这是因为“毛泽东是今天能够引导各国人民取得彻底解放的伟大思想的化身。历代最杰出的无产阶级领袖，无不遭到反动势力和改良主义者兽性的痛恨。马克思和恩格斯受尽革命敌人的辱骂。没有人比列宁受到国际反动派、社会主义叛徒更厉害的攻击和咒骂。”
    文章说：“至今为止，任何巨大规模的斗争，如果没有久经考验的、有威望的、有权威的领袖来领导，都是不可能实现的。工人阶级不仅有自己本国的领袖，而且有世界范围内的领袖。”
    文章强调说：“毫无疑问，在目前，由于毛泽东的胆略、由于他的革命坚定性、由于他的经历、由于他的政治远见，因此，他是全世界无产阶级的当然领袖。他是对美帝国主义进行不调和的斗争、为社会主义在全世界所有国家取得胜利而进行不调和斗争的象征。他领导着世界革命的主要堡垒，领导着一个勇敢地同美国好战分子斗争的七亿人口的国家。他是世界各国革命者捍卫战无不胜的马克思列宁主义原理、反对现代修正主义的伟大斗争的旗手。无论在中国还是在全世界，大力地突出毛泽东的名字，都是革命斗争的要求。”
    文章接着说：“传播和学习毛泽东思想，对所有拥护革命的人说来，是一种需要。毛泽东思想不是别的，正是运用于我们当代的马克思列宁主义。这位中国共产党的领袖创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理运用于中国革命的实践，丰富了并在继续丰富着强大的无产阶级学说。他的思想照亮了为民族解放、人民民主和社会主义而斗争的人们的道路。在群众中传播这种思想，就是促进革命。”
