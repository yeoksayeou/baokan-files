Munich

Munich is the largest city in southern West Germany. Historically, Munich was the stronghold of the German Nazi Party. In September 1938, the heads of state of England, France, Germany, and Italy met in Munich and signed an agreement stipulating that Czechoslovakia cede most of its territory to Germany. The imperialists of England and France attempted to use this method to encourage Fascist Germany to direct its aggression towards the Soviet Union. As a result, with the connivance of England and France, Fascist Germany not only completely annexed Czechoslovakia but also instigated the Second World War. Later, people referred to this imperialist policy of sacrificing other countries and encouraging aggression as the Munich Policy.

    慕尼黑
    慕尼黑是西德南部最大的城市。在历史上，慕尼黑是德国纳粹党的根据地。一九三八年九月，英、法、德、意四国首脑在慕尼黑开会，签订了一项协定，规定捷克斯洛伐克把大部分领土割让给德国。英、法帝国主义企图用这种办法，来鼓励法西斯德国把侵略矛头指向苏联。结果，在英、法的纵容下，法西斯德国不但完全吞并了捷克斯洛伐克，而且挑起了第二次世界大战。后来人们把帝国主义这种牺牲他国、纵容侵略的政策，叫做慕尼黑政策。
