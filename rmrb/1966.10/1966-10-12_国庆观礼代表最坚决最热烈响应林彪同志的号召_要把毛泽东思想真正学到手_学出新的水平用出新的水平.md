Representatives from various ethnic groups who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations have expressed their firm support and enthusiastic response to Comrade Lin Biao's call to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They said that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions reflect the sentiments of the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants of all ethnic groups across the country, pointing out the direction for their progress.

The heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team, known as the "collective of proletarian revolutionary heroism," after seriously studying Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, resolved to better master Mao Zedong Thought. Wang Youfa, a hero in the style of Huang Jiguang who fought through fire and water, said that Comrade Lin Biao's call is not only a mobilization order to the entire army but also a battle cry to the 700 million people of the country. If the 700 million people truly master Mao Zedong Thought, imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries will be nothing to fear. We will be able to smash the entire old world and create a bright red new world. Deputy team leader Wang Cunyu expressed that he would definitely learn from the People's Liberation Army better, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and create greater achievements for the Party and the people. Team members Hu Debing, Lei Hongbing, Peng Jiazhi, and worker family member Mou Maoxiu declared that they would study Chairman Mao's works even better, focusing on application, and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Representatives from the industrial and agricultural fronts across the country excitedly pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions have brought them new and great strength. Shanghai Qiuxin Shipbuilding Factory worker Xiao Yinzhen said that in the future, she would better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further focusing on ideological revolutionization. She said that only by revolutionizing one's ideology can Mao Zedong Thought be applied actively and effectively in production. Worker Wu Guixian from Xiangtan Cotton Mill No. 1 emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is our action guideline and the source of our victories. The deeper our love and faith in Mao Zedong Thought, the better we can study and apply Chairman Mao's books. Workers Zhou Aqing from Nanjing Radio Factory and Engineer Zhao Zhijian from Jiangxi Tractor Factory pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions have set higher requirements and pointed out the direction for them. They combined studying Comrade Lin Biao's instructions with learning from the inspiring examples of the PLA's heroes in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, finding their own gaps, and expressed their determination to follow the PLA, pushing their own and their factory's study activities to a new stage. Zhao Zhijian also stressed that the "Three Articles" are forever "New Three Articles," and we must study them for life, apply them for life, study them at all times, and apply them at all times.

Hebei Province's active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Lyu Yulan, said: Comrade Lin Biao's call to the PLA is also a call to the people of the entire country. The PLA has already studied well, and today they need to reach even greater heights. We poor and lower-middle peasants also cannot remain at our original level. She said that one must have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, the busier the work, the more one must study, the more difficulties there are, the more one must study, the greater the contradictions, the more one must study, and the more complex the struggles, the more one must study. Jia Jincai, chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of Dazhai Brigade, said: The more I listen to Comrade Lin Biao's call, the more energetic I feel. Chairman Mao's books are treasures of revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought in hand, anything can be done, any disaster can be overcome, and any harm can be eliminated. Deng Huagui, secretary of the Party branch of Huangshandong Brigade in Boluo County, Guangdong Province, mentioned that many people in Huangshandong can now recite "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and many illiterate people can recite more than sixty quotations from Chairman Mao. In the future, not only must we study diligently, but more importantly, we must apply diligently. We must combine our study with our ideological reality and the reality of the three great revolutionary movements, study diligently, and apply diligently. Met Altao, a famous active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a poor peasant from Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, expressed that she would go back and lead her family, production team, and the entire brigade to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieving new levels of study and application. She said, "One person studying well makes one heart bright, everyone studying well makes a red expanse, and collective power is boundless."

More than six hundred representatives from various ethnic minorities across the country expressed in different languages during a discussion that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are very timely and important. They said that they would definitely carry out this instruction, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, turning every sector of the country into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The famous Korean ethnic model of studying Chairman Mao's works, Huang Shuyu, said that Comrade Lin Biao's timely call in the new situation has brought the nationwide movement of studying Chairman Mao's works into a new stage. We must study with the strongest class feelings, truly making Mao Zedong Thought our soul.

Representatives from Tibet said excitedly: The hundred thousand emancipated serfs in Tibet need to be liberated, need revolution, and need to build a new socialist life. We must truly master Mao Zedong Thought, letting Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the entire Tibetan plateau red. Kang Qiong, who became a vice township head, said: I will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works first in all matters. Gang Sangwongzu said: "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of us emancipated serfs. I will forever be a good student of Chairman Mao."

Uyghur representative Abuduola and Kazakh representative Mushtapa, holding "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said that coming to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, whom they miss day and night, and hearing the call from Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, by Chairman Mao's side, is a double joy. Abuduola also emphasized: "The PLA holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studies Chairman Mao's books well, and applies them well, setting the best example for us. We must catch up with the PLA, study for the revolution, apply for the revolution, never forget class struggle, and defend and build the socialist motherland's borders."

Representatives from the "grassland Dazhai," Wushenzhao Commune in Inner Mongolia, Sqinggeli, said: Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the people of Wushenzhao. I will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call and go back to turn Wushenzhao into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. Mongolian representative Degjijiwu also happily said that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions hit the spot, just in time. I will go back to the commune and lead everyone to create a strong atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works and fully charge the spirit of studying and applying.

Bian Zhuodi, a Zhuang ethnic female community member from Guangxi who is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, composed a mountain song before coming to Beijing to share her learning experiences in thirteen brigades, expressing her enthusiastic response to Comrade Lin Biao's call. Li ethnic youth Huang Qiyuan from Hainan Island once captured a fully armed American Kuomintang spy with bare hands and was awarded the title of second-class meritorious warrior. He said, "One can go a day without food, but one cannot go a day without reading Chairman Mao's books. I will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, focus on application, and achieve ideological revolutionization."
