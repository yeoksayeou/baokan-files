October 12 marked the 21st anniversary of the Lao Revolution. On this day, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a call to arms, urging the nation's people to strengthen unity, fight bravely, and resolutely carry on the just struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys to the end. This is a heroic declaration of struggle by the Lao people, a proclamation to vanquish the American aggressors and their lackeys.

The past 21 years have been a period of glorious struggle for the Lao people under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, fighting against old and new colonialism and striving for national liberation. They have successfully waged a nine-year war against the French and have been bravely fighting against the world's most vicious enemy, American imperialism, and its lackeys for over a decade. The 21-year history of struggle has proven: the Lao people are indeed a heroic people. Such a people are invincible!

Currently, the tasks facing the Lao people are still very arduous. While expanding the war in Vietnam, American imperialism is also intensifying its preparations to launch new armed attacks on the liberated areas of Laos. Recently, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara's visit to Saigon was aimed at plotting to expand the war in Vietnam. These facts indicate that the American aggressors are attempting to further escalate the war in Vietnam to Laos and the entire Indochina region.

Facing this situation, the Lao Patriotic Front calls on the nation's people to continue to fight resolutely and not retreat. The call to arms states: "No matter how long this war lasts, no matter what sacrifices we have to make, we will carry on this just war against American imperialism and its lackeys to the end." This call reflects the iron will of the entire Lao people to thoroughly defeat American imperialist aggression and achieve national liberation. Chairman Mao, in his 1948 essay "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," pointed out: "The enemy will not disappear of its own accord. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the U.S. imperialist forces of aggression in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." The situation in Laos today is the same. The American aggressors and their lackeys in Laos will not disappear of their own accord. All reactionary elements are not defeated unless they are fought against. The Lao people must fight resolutely and fight to the end to achieve final victory and build a completely independent new Laos!

The Chinese people firmly support the Lao people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation. We are confident that as long as the Lao people strengthen their unity and carry on the spirit of brave struggle, they will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve the final victory of the Lao national liberation cause.

    气壮山河的战斗宣言
    本报评论员
    十月十二日是老挝革命节二十一周年纪念日。这天，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发表了号召书，号召全国人民加强团结，英勇战斗，坚决把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争进行到底。这是老挝民族气壮山河的战斗宣言，是讨伐美国侵略强盗及其走狗的檄文。
    过去的二十一年，是老挝人民在光荣的老挝爱国战线党的领导下，坚持反对新老殖民主义、争取民族解放斗争的二十一年。他们曾经胜利地进行了九年抗法战争，随后又同世界上最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗，进行了十多年的英勇战斗。二十一年的斗争历史证明：老挝人民不愧为英雄的人民。这样的人民是不可战胜的！
    当前，老挝人民的斗争任务还是十分艰巨的。美帝国主义在扩大侵越战争的同时，正在加紧部署，对老挝解放区发动新的武装进攻。最近，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉到西贡去活动，就是为了策划扩大侵越战争的阴谋。这些事实表明，美国侵略者正在力图把侵越战争进一步扩大到老挝和整个印度支那。
    面临着这种形势，老挝爱国战线党号召全国人民继续坚决战斗，决不后退。号召书指出：“不管这一场战争打多久，不管要付出多大的牺牲，我们也要把这一场反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义战争进行到底”。这个号召反映了老挝全体人民彻底打败美帝国主义侵略、争取民族解放的钢铁般的意志。毛主席在一九四八年写的《将革命进行到底》一文中指出：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”今天老挝的情况也是一样。美国强盗及其在老挝的走狗，决不会自行消灭的。凡是反动的东西，是不打不倒的。老挝人民只有坚决打，打到底，才能打出最后胜利来，才能打出一个完全独立的人民的新老挝来！
    中国人民坚决支持老挝人民的抗美救国斗争。我们坚信，只要老挝人民加强团结，发扬英勇战斗精神，就一定能够排除万难，取得老挝民族解放事业的最后胜利。
