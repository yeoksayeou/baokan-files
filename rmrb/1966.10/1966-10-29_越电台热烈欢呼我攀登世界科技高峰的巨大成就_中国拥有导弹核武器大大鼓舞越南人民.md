Vietnamese Radio Station Warmly Celebrates China's Great Achievement in Climbing the World's Scientific and Technological Peak
China's Possession of Missiles and Nuclear Weapons Greatly Inspires the Vietnamese People

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, October 28th – The "Voice of Vietnam" radio station broadcasted the news of China's successful test of nuclear missiles multiple times on the 28th and published a commentary titled "Warmly Celebrating the Great New Achievement of Our Brotherly Chinese People."

	The commentary pointed out, "This great achievement of China is the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao. It is a brilliant victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."

	The commentary said, "The Vietnamese people are overjoyed by the success of our brotherly Chinese people in testing nuclear missiles. We regard China's victory as our own. With boundless excitement, we extend our warmest congratulations to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, workers, engineering and technical personnel, and all brotherly Chinese people."

	The commentary said, the imperialists led by the United States are in a state of panic in the face of the news of China's successful test of nuclear missiles. The Vietnamese people and peace-loving people around the world, however, feel boundless excitement and pride. Because China possesses nuclear weapons and then missiles, this is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression for national salvation and to the revolutionary people of various countries who are fighting for liberation. It is a very precious contribution to the cause of safeguarding world peace.

	The commentary said, "Seventeen years ago, China was an impoverished and backward agricultural country. However, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have displayed self-reliance, bravely overcoming all difficulties and achieving many victories in the cause of socialist construction. The old semi-colonial and semi-feudal China has today become a socialist power with a modern industry, modern agriculture, modern national defense, and a modern scientific and technological foundation." "In the seventeen years of socialist construction, China has climbed many peaks of world scientific and technological achievement that capitalist countries with a hundred years of industrial development have not reached."

	The commentary said, China is a country that loves peace very much. "China's development of missiles and nuclear weapons is for self-defense, to safeguard the Chinese people and to oppose the threat of missiles and nuclear weapons by U.S. imperialism. China's goal in this field is to break the monopoly of missiles and nuclear weapons by U.S. imperialism, so that they can no longer use missiles and nuclear weapons to threaten and intimidate the people of various countries."

	The commentary said, "In this test, China once again solemnly declares that under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will, as always, firmly and unwaveringly strive for the lofty goal of a complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. This declaration is a powerful proof of China's determination to safeguard peace."

    越电台热烈欢呼我攀登世界科技高峰的巨大成就
    中国拥有导弹核武器大大鼓舞越南人民
    新华社河内二十八日电　“越南之声”广播电台二十八日连续广播了中国试验导弹核武器成功的消息，并且发表题为《热烈欢呼兄弟的中国人民巨大的新成就》的评论。
    评论指出，“中国的这一巨大成就，是以毛主席为首的中国共产党的正确领导的结果，是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。”
    评论说，“越南人民对兄弟的中国人民试验导弹核武器成功感到欢欣鼓舞。我们把中国的这一胜利看作是自己的胜利，我们怀着无比兴奋的心情，向中国人民解放军、工人、工程技术人员和全体兄弟的中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺。”
    评论说，以美国为首的帝国主义，正在中国成功试验导弹核武器的消息面前惊慌失措。而越南人民和世界爱好和平人民却感到无限兴奋和自豪。因为中国拥有原子武器，接着又拥有导弹，这是对正在进行抗美救国斗争的越南人民和正在进行解放斗争的各国革命人民的巨大鼓舞，是对保卫世界和平事业的极其宝贵的贡献。
    评论说，“十七年前，中国还是一个‘一穷二白’的农业落后的国家。但是，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，中国人民发扬自力更生精神，英勇地克服了一切困难，在社会主义建设事业中接连取得许多胜利。半殖民地半封建的旧中国，今天已经成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代国防和现代科学技术基础的社会主义强国”。“中国在十七年进行社会主义建设中，已经攀登了许多具有百年工业发展基础的资本主义国家所没有达到的世界科学技术的高峰。”
    评论说，中国是一个十分爱好和平的国家。“中国发展导弹和核武器是为了自卫，是为了保卫中国人民、反对美帝国主义的导弹和核武器威胁。中国在这个领域中的目标，是为了粉碎美帝国主义的导弹和核武器的垄断，使它们不能继续用导弹和核武器来威胁和恫吓各国人民。”
    评论说，“在这次试验中，中国再一次郑重宣布，在任何时候、任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。中国人民和中国政府将一如既往，坚定不移地为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而奋斗。这一声明是中国决心保卫和平的强有力的证据。”
