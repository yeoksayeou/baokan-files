Johnson, the notorious war-monger, the U.S. President, secretly flew to the U.S. war base at Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam after the Manila conference, which he himself orchestrated to escalate the aggression in Vietnam, ended on October 26. This was an "absolutely secret" lightning visit.

Upon arriving at the Cam Ranh Bay base, where 11,000 U.S. aggressor troops are stationed, Johnson immediately addressed the U.S. troops. He desperately tried to boost the morale of the U.S. soldiers, who had been beaten down by the South Vietnamese people. He raved madly about "repelling" the "invasion" across the border. He also "inspected" the vast Cam Ranh Bay air base and the U.S. military supply warehouses.

Johnson, who is terrified by the widespread people's war in South Vietnam, arranged this "visit" in extreme secrecy to save his own skin. This coward, under heavy guard, hastily completed his "visit" in about two and a half hours before fleeing back to Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by airplane.

    约翰逊偷偷到南越金兰湾活动
    据新华社二十七日讯　西贡消息：臭名昭著的战争贩子——美国总统约翰逊，在他一手策划的扩大侵越战争的马尼拉会议结束后，二十六日偷偷飞到美国在南越的战争基地——金兰湾进行了一次“绝对保密”的闪电式“访问”。约翰逊和腊斯克等一伙人在刚刚到达驻有一万一千名美国侵略军的金兰湾基地后，他就向美国侵略军发表讲话，竭力给那些被南越人民打得丧魂落魄的美军士兵们打气，疯狂叫嚷要“击退”越过边界的“侵略”。他还“视察”了巨大的金兰湾空军基地和美军供应仓库等。
    被广泛开展人民战争的南越军民吓破了胆的约翰逊，为了保命，把这次“访问”活动弄得极端“保密”。这个怕死鬼在戒备森严的状态中匆匆“访问”了约两个半小时后，就又乘飞机溜回了菲律宾的首都马尼拉。
