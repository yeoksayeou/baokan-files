I went to Fangcheng County, Xiu Shi Commune, Fan Jia Production Brigade to understand the work situation of Yang Yushan, a graduate of the Veterinary Department of Jiangxi Communist Labor University, in the countryside. The brigade leader, upon seeing me, immediately took my hand and said, "You talk about Little Yang, he is indeed a good comrade. His ideology is red, his skills are solid, and he can blend in with the masses. We need university students like those from your Communist Labor University."

At this moment, the commune members living in the brigade office also gathered around. Taking advantage of the opportunity when everyone was free, we held a discussion meeting.

The chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, Huang Shuisheng, said, "Little Yang is truly 100% dedicated to his work. Compared to the past when some people at the veterinary station had the 'three immobiles' (not moving during rest, not moving when there is work at the station, not moving when the distance is far or it is late), he is beyond words. Last March, when the pig in the home of Fan De Dong in our brigade got sick, at ten o'clock in the evening, we went to ask for his help. At that time, Little Yang had just returned from another place, he put down his bowl of rice and followed Fan De Dong to treat the pig. This is truly a good student cultivated by Chairman Mao."

Poor peasant Fan Xigen said, "Little Yang is always in solidarity with us poor and lower-middle peasants. If your pig gets sick, you ask for his help today, and tomorrow you don't need to ask again, he will definitely come to check if the pig is better, otherwise, he won't be at ease."

The speeches at the discussion meeting were very enthusiastic. I did not interrupt but just kept taking notes.

The director of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, Fan Tinghe, also introduced Little Yang's learning of castration. He said, "When we heard that he wanted to learn castration, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Fan Jia Village enthusiastically supported him, encouraged him, and let him start practicing in our village. At first, he was a bit afraid of making mistakes, but we said, 'Go ahead and practice, we trust you, even if you make a mistake, it's okay.'"

Later, I learned that Little Yang's learning of castration involved a struggle!

Originally, there were two veterinarians here who considered castration as an inherited "iron rice bowl" and were unwilling to easily teach others, intending to make some money and go into private business. Seeing this situation, Little Yang couldn't wait to learn the castration technique and resolutely block the capitalist road.

After diligent study and practice, he finally mastered the castration technique. He helped the masses castrate more than ten pigs without any accidents.

Little Yang also often encountered difficulties in his work, but he firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and wholeheartedly served the people. Therefore, he quickly took root among the masses.

    “我们就是要这样的大学生”
    ——江西共产主义劳动大学毕业生杨玉山为贫下中农服务的事迹
    我到丰城县秀市公社范家生产队，了解江西共产主义劳动大学牧医系毕业生杨玉山在农村工作的情况。队长一见面就拉着我的手说：“你说小杨呀，这可是个好同志。他思想红，技术过硬，能和群众打成一片。我们就是要你们共大这样的大学生。”
    这时，住在队部院里的社员也围上来了。趁大伙儿有空，开了一个座谈会。
    贫协主席黄水生说：“小杨这个人对工作真是百分之百的认真。比起过去兽医站某些人的‘三不动’（休息的时候不动身，站里有事不动身，路远或天晚时不动身），真是好得没话说。去年三月间，我队范德东家里的猪病了，晚上十点钟去请他，这时小杨刚从别处回站，把饭碗一丢，就随着范德东来诊猪病。这真是毛主席培养出来的好学生。”
    贫农范西根说：“小杨处处同我们贫下中农一条心。你家里的猪病了，今天请了他，明天就不要再请了，他准来看看猪好了没有，要不，他就是不放心。”
    座谈会上的发言真是热烈，我一直没有插嘴，只是一股劲儿地作记录。
    贫协组长范庭和还介绍了小杨学阉割的事。他说：“听说他要学阉割，我们范家村的贫下中农就大力支持他，鼓励他，让他在咱们村先割。开始他还有些怕割坏，我们就说：‘你割吧，我们信得过你，就是割坏了也不要紧’。”后来，我才知道小杨学阉割，还经过一番斗争呢！
    原来这里有两个兽医，自认为阉割是祖传的“铁饭碗”，不肯轻易教人，一心想赚几个钱搞单干。小杨看到这情况，恨不得一下子学会阉割技术，坚决把资本主义的路堵死。
    经过勤学苦练，他终于学会了阉割技术。帮群众阉割了上十头猪，没有发生事故。
    小杨在工作中也经常碰到困难，但他牢牢记住毛主席的教导，全心全意地为人民服务。因此，他很快就在群众中扎下了根子。
