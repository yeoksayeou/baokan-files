Vice Premier Chen Yi Replies to Vongvisith Supporting the Stand of the Lao Patriotic Front
The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos Has Become a Tool for U.S. Aggression; British and Soviet Governments' Shameless Cover-Up Fully Exposes Their Role as Accomplices

	BEIJING, Oct. 2 (New China News Agency) -- Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Chen Yi, on Oct. 2 replied to the letter from Vongvisith, General Secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Culture, and Tourism of the Lao National United Government, and member of the National Implementation Committee of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos Question, expressing the firm support of the Chinese Government and people for the stand taken in the statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on Aug. 29. The full text of the reply is as follows:

	To Vongvisith, General Secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Culture, and Tourism of the Lao National United Government, and Member of the National Implementation Committee of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos Question,

	I have received your letter and the statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front dated Aug. 29, 1966, which you enclosed.

	In its statement, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front has sternly denounced the U.S. imperialists' aggression and interference in Laos and their plot to expand the war of aggression in Indochina; it has exposed and denounced the illegal activities of the British Government and the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos in serving the U.S. imperialists and slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Lao Patriotic Front. I, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, firmly support the above-mentioned stand of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front.

	At present, the U.S. imperialists are stepping up their aggression against South Vietnam, plotting to launch a new dry-season offensive, and intensifying their bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists are also plotting to gradually expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to Laos and the whole of Indochina. Recently, U.S. planes have even repeatedly intruded into Chinese airspace to carry out military provocations. At this time, the British Government and the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos have again slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Lao Patriotic Front, obviously acting on the instructions of the United States, with the aim of deceiving world public opinion and serving the U.S. imperialists' plot to expand the war of aggression.

	The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos has long since become a tool of U.S. aggression. The Lao Patriotic Front has repeatedly demanded the cessation of the illegal activities of the International Commission. However, the British Government and the Soviet Government, as the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, have consistently adopted an attitude of connivance and cover-up toward the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos. The actions of the British Government and the Soviet Government fully expose them as accomplices of U.S. aggression. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front pointed out in its statement that all activities carried out in the name of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos are completely illegal and invalid. The Chinese Government considers that the stand of the Lao Patriotic Front on this question is completely justified.

	In the face of the heroic struggle of the Lao people and the people of Indochina, the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism has been fully exposed. No matter how the U.S. imperialists struggle, no matter how hard their accomplices work for them, they cannot escape the fate of final defeat. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they will not be able to go against this logic."

	Yours sincerely,

	Chen Yi
	Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
	Beijing, Oct. 2, 1966

	BEIJING, Oct. 2 (New China News Agency) -- Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi received a letter from Vongvisith, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Culture, and Tourism of the Lao National United Government, and member of the National Implementation Committee of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos Question, in August, together with a statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on Aug. 29.

	The statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front sternly denounced the U.S. imperialists' aggression and interference in Laos and their plot to expand the war of aggression in Indochina; it exposed and denounced the illegal activities of the British Government and the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos in serving the U.S. imperialists and slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Lao Patriotic Front.

	The statement pointed out that the United States is stepping up its war of aggression against Laos, attempting to expand this war to the whole of Indochina, and plotting military adventures that threaten the peace of Southeast Asia and the world. The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos fabricated a "report," repeating the nonsense of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, claiming that "there are North Vietnamese troops in Laos," with the aim of helping the U.S. imperialists prepare public opinion for their plot to expand the war of aggression.

	The statement pointed out that, according to the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos Question, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos has lost all legal rights to carry out activities in Laos since July 30, 1965.

	The statement pointed out that the British Government, on Aug. 22, published the "report" of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos and arbitrarily added slanderous remarks, which is a despicable act of collusion with the U.S. imperialists' aggression and war-expansion plot and a despicable act against the Lao people.

    陈毅副总理复信冯维希支持老挝爱国战线党的严正立场
    老挝国际委员会已成为美帝侵略工具  英苏政府肆意包庇充分暴露帮凶面目
    新华社二日讯　中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅，二日复信老挝爱国战线党总书记、老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议全国实施委员会委员富米·冯维希，代表中国政府和人民坚决支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会八月二十九日声明的严正立场。复信全文如下：桑怒老挝爱国战线党总书记、老挝民族团结政府
  新闻、宣传和游览大臣、一九六二年关
  于老挝问题的日内瓦协议全国实施委员
  会委员富米·冯维希先生阁下，阁下：
    我收到了你的来信和随信附来的老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一九六六年八月二十九日的声明。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在声明中严正谴责了美帝国主义侵略、干涉老挝和阴谋扩大侵略印度支那战争的罪行；揭露和谴责了英国政府和老挝国际委员会为美帝国主义效劳、诬蔑越南民主共和国和老挝爱国战线党的非法活动。我代表中国政府和中国人民坚决支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的上述严正立场。
    目前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大侵略越南南方的战争，阴谋发动新的旱季攻势，并且加紧对越南民主共和国的轰炸。美帝国主义还阴谋逐步把侵略越南的战争扩大到老挝和整个印度支那。最近，美国飞机甚至接连侵入中国领空进行军事挑衅。在这个时候，英国政府和老挝国际委员会再次对越南民主共和国和老挝爱国战线党进行诬蔑，显然是在美国的指使下进行的，目的是为了欺骗世界舆论，为美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋效劳。
    老挝国际委员会早已成为美帝国主义的侵略工具。老挝爱国战线党曾经一再要求停止国际委员会的非法活动。但是，作为日内瓦会议两主席的英国政府和苏联政府却一贯对老挝国际委员会采取纵容和包庇的态度。英国政府和苏联政府的所作所为，充分暴露了他们是美帝国主义的侵略帮凶。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在声明中指出，任何人利用老挝国际委员会的名义进行的一切活动都是完全非法和无效的。中国政府认为，老挝爱国战线党的这一立场是完全正当的。
    在老挝人民和印度支那人民的英勇斗争面前，美帝国主义纸老虎的原形，已经暴露无遗。不管美帝国主义怎样进行挣扎，不管它的帮凶怎样为它卖力，它们都逃脱不了最后失败的命运。正如毛泽东主席指出的，捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。
    顺致敬意。
    中华人民共和国
    国务院副总理兼外交部长  陈毅
    一九六六年十月二日于北京
    新华社二日讯　陈毅副总理兼外交部长收到了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议全国实施委员会委员富米·冯维希八月间的一封来信和附来的老挝爱国战线党中央委员会八月二十九日发表的一项声明。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的声明严正谴责了美帝国主义侵略、干涉老挝和阴谋扩大侵略印度支那战争的罪行；揭露和谴责了英国政府和老挝国际委员会为美帝国主义效劳、诬蔑越南民主共和国和老挝爱国战线党的非法活动。
    声明指出，美国正在加紧进行侵略老挝的战争，妄图把这场战争扩大到整个印度支那，阴谋进行威胁东南亚和世界和平的军事冒险。老挝国际委员会捏造出一个“报告”，重弹美帝国主义及其走狗的滥调，说什么“在老挝有北越军队”，其目的是为了帮助美帝国主义实现扩大侵略战争的阴谋进行舆论准备。
    声明指出，按照一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，从一九六五年七月三十日起，老挝国际委员会就失去在老挝进行合法活动的一切权利。
    声明指出，英国政府在八月二十二日公布了老挝国际委员会的“报告”，并且恣意加进诬蔑的论调，是附和美帝国主义侵略和扩大战争阴谋的卑鄙行为，是反对老挝人民的卑鄙行为。
