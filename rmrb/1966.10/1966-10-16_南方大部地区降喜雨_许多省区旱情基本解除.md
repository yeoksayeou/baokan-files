Central Meteorological Observatory reports that during the first half of October, most of the drought-affected areas in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River received rainfall. The long-standing drought in most parts of Hubei and Hunan provinces, most of Jiangxi, most of Fujian, as well as southern Henan and northern Guangdong and Guangxi, have all experienced heavy or torrential rain. The total rainfall in various regions generally ranged from 50 millimeters to over 100 millimeters, which is one to three times the average for the same period in previous years. The drought in southern Henan, which has persisted since April, has significantly eased; the severe droughts that occurred in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangxi since mid-July have been largely alleviated by the rain. This is highly beneficial for autumn planting and late-season rice growth. Only a few areas have experienced excessive rainfall.

In addition to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, most of Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, as well as the Shandong Peninsula, received appropriate rainfall before October, with 25 to 60 millimeters of rain falling in the first half of October, which is more than the average for the same period in previous years. This is very favorable for the sowing and germination of winter wheat in the aforementioned regions.

    南方大部地区降喜雨
    许多省区旱情基本解除
    新华社十五日讯　中央气象台消息：十月上半月，我国长江中游大部分受旱的地区都下了雨。长期干旱的湖北省和湖南大部、江西大部、福建大部地区，以及河南南部和广东、广西北部地区，先后都下了大雨或暴雨。各地总雨量一般达五十毫米到一百多毫米，比常年同期偏多一倍到三倍。河南南部从四月份以来出现的旱情现在已大为缓和；湖北、湖南、江西、福建、广西等地区七月下半月以来先后出现的严重干旱，雨后已基本排除。这对秋播和晚稻生长很有益处，只有个别地区出现了雨水过多的现象。
    除长江中游地区外，陕西、山西两省大部，以及山东半岛等地区十月以前降雨比较适宜，十月上半月又分别下了二十五毫米到六十毫米的雨，雨量比常年同期为多。这对上述各地的冬小麦播种和出苗十分有利。
