Vietnamese newspapers have condemned the visit of U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to Saigon, accusing him of plotting to escalate the aggressive war in Vietnam. They assert that the U.S. imperialists' military adventures in South Vietnam will inevitably lead to greater failures.

The Cambodian national radio has exposed the U.S. imperialists' use of false peace tactics to accompany the escalation of the war.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on October 10, the Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published a commentary on October 8. It pointed out that McNamara's trip to Saigon only serves to highlight the severe failures the U.S. has suffered in South Vietnam, and it exposes the U.S.'s so-called "peaceful intentions" as mere deception.

The commentary stated that the purpose of McNamara's visit to Saigon is to plan the expansion of the U.S. imperialists' evil invasion of South Vietnam and to prepare for a "new strategic counteroffensive" during the upcoming dry season.

The commentary noted that McNamara made this trip at a time when the U.S.-puppet regime is in a precarious position. It said that McNamara's previous seven "visits" to Saigon failed to reverse the U.S.'s failures, and his eighth visit will certainly not bring new hope to the U.S. aggressors. The *People's Army Newspaper* also published a commentary on October 7, stating that each time McNamara "visits" South Vietnam, it marks a new heavy defeat for the U.S.'s aggressive war.

The commentary pointed out that each time McNamara goes to South Vietnam, the U.S. becomes more deeply embroiled in military adventurism and suffers more severe defeats. This trip to Saigon will be no exception to this rule.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh on October 7, the Cambodian national radio broadcasted a commentary on the evening of October 6, once again exposing the U.S. imperialists' false peace posture on the Vietnam issue, deceiving American and international public opinion.

The commentary pointed out that Johnson, Bundy, Rusk, and others recently expressed the U.S. government's willingness to "reconcile" on the Vietnam issue and to resolve the Vietnam problem through negotiations.

The commentary emphasized: "Every surface peace posture or statement by the U.S. is always accompanied by intensified war efforts and new attempts to escalate the war." Indeed, Johnson and his government are very keen on using this tactic. The commentary said, however, that this tactic will never succeed.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on October 10, Saigon news: U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara arrived in Saigon on October 10. He will stay in South Vietnam for four days to hasten the planning of further escalation of the war in Vietnam.

This is the eighth time the infamous war monger has been to South Vietnam since 1962. This time, he is accompanied by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Katzenbach and Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler, among others.

According to reports from Western news agencies, after arriving at the New Saigon Airport, McNamara immediately made warlike statements at a press conference. He said that since his "visit" to South Vietnam last year, the number of U.S. troops invading Vietnam has doubled in less than twelve months.

    越报谴责麦克纳马拉到西贡策划扩大侵略战争
    美帝在南越加紧军事冒险必遭更大失败
    柬埔寨国家电台揭露美帝用假和平手法配合战争“升级”
    据新华社河内十日电  越南《人民报》八日发表评论指出，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉的西贡之行，只能说明美国在南越遭到了惨重失败，同时揭穿了美国的“和平诚意”只是一种欺骗。
    评论说，麦克纳马拉的西贡之行，目的是策划扩大美帝国主义对越南南方进行的罪恶的侵略战争，并准备在即将到来的旱季中，发动一次“新的战略反攻”。
    评论说，麦克纳马拉这次是在美伪集团地位岌岌可危的时候前往西贡的。评论说，麦克纳马拉前七次“访问”西贡，未能挽救美国的失败，他的第八次西贡之行，肯定也不会给美国侵略者带来新的希望。《人民军队报》七日也发表评论说，麦克纳马拉每到南越“访问”一次，就是美国的侵略战争遭到沉重失败的一个新的凭证。
    评论指出，麦克纳马拉每次到南越，都使美国更深地走向军事冒险的道路和遭到更加惨重的失败。这次西贡之行，也完全不会离开这一规律。
    据新华社金边七日电柬埔寨国家电台六日晚上发表评论，再次揭露美帝国主义在越南问题上装出假和平姿态，欺骗美国舆论和世界舆论。
    评论指出，约翰逊、邦迪、腊斯克等人最近表示美国政府愿意在越南问题上“和解”，并且通过谈判解决越南问题。
    评论强调指出：“美国的每一个表面的和平姿态或者声明，都始终是同加紧进行战争和再次使战争‘升级’的新企图相配合的。”的确，约翰逊及其政府都非常热中于采取这种手法。评论说，但是，这种手法是永远不会得逞的。
    据新华社十日讯　西贡消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉十日到达西贡，他将在南越活动四天，以加紧策划进一步扩大侵越战争。
    这是这个臭名远扬的战争贩子自一九六二年以来第八次到南越活动。这次同他一起到南越活动的有美国副国务卿卡曾巴赫和美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒等人。
    据西方通讯社报道，麦克纳马拉在刚刚到达西贡的新山一机场以后，就在记者招待会上不断发出战争叫嚣。他说，自从他去年“访问”南越以来，在不到十二个月中侵越美军已增加一倍。
