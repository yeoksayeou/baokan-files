The Australian *Vanguard* strongly condemned the collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in betraying the Vietnamese people in an editorial published on October 20, commenting on U.S. President Lyndon Johnson's activities in Australia.

The editorial said that U.S. imperialism plays a despicable role of aggressor on the world stage, while the role played by the Soviet leaders is even more hateful.

The editorial pointed out: "The Soviet leaders are increasingly scheming to align their role with that of U.S. imperialism. They are conspiring to betray the Vietnamese people. This must be recognized."

The *Vanguard* said that the Soviet leaders can play their malicious tricks, but the Vietnamese people have the genuine support of the oppressed peoples of the world. Their struggle is bound to be victorious.

The *Vanguard* pointed out that Johnson's activities in Australia clearly show the isolation of the United States. His visit will only increase the people's resistance.

    澳《先锋报》谴责美苏勾结出卖越南人民
    新华社墨尔本二十日电　澳大利亚《先锋报》二十日就美国总统约翰逊到澳大利亚活动发表评论，强烈谴责美苏勾结。
    评论说，美帝国主义在世界舞台上扮演着令人憎恶的侵略者角色，而苏联领导人扮演的角色更加可恨。
    评论指出：“苏联领导人正在日益处心积虑地把自己的角色同美帝国主义的角色配合起来。他们在阴谋出卖越南人民。千万要认清这一点。”
    《先锋报》说，苏联领导人可以玩弄和施展他们的险恶阴谋，但是，越南人民得到世界被压迫人民的真正支持。他们的斗争必定能够取得胜利。
    《先锋报》指出，约翰逊到澳大利亚活动，再清楚不过地表明了美国的孤立。他的访问必将增加人民的反抗。
