The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists for their "peace talks" deception over the Vietnam issue. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, after observing the recent developments in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, feels it has the responsibility to expose the new conspiracy plotted by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership: to make the U.S. occupation of Vietnam permanent.

In June, the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers in Support of the National Liberation Struggles of the Vietnamese and Asian-African Peoples was held in Beijing. During the conference, the U.S. imperialists bombed Hanoi and Haiphong. However, this did not save the U.S. imperialists from their failures on the Vietnam battlefield.

Every time the U.S. aggressors face new failures or plot to expand the war in Vietnam, they shout for "peace talks." This has become a routine for the U.S. aggressors.

Recently, the U.S. aggressors have again tried to use the so-called cessation of bombing to induce the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks," lay down their weapons, and let the U.S. imperialists obtain what they cannot get on the battlefield through negotiations.

Johnson's "peace offensive" is being carried out while two Marine Corps divisions are being sent to the demilitarized zone, and McNamara is busy in Saigon planning further escalation of the war in Vietnam. This clearly shows that their "peace talks" conspiracy is merely a smokescreen for the escalation of the war in Vietnam. The Afro-Asian writers and peoples strongly condemn this "escalation—'peace talks'—further escalation" conspiracy.

It is noteworthy that the U.S. "peace offensive" is being carried out while Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko is visiting the White House. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are conspiring together in this dirty plot. Under the U.S. imperialists' direction, their various lackeys and followers are working hard to promote the "peace talks" deception. The so-called "Manila Conference" held by several countries, British Foreign Secretary Brown's so-called six-point plan, the Vatican's "peace appeal," and the efforts of the Yugoslav and Indian reactionaries to promote "non-alignment" are all manifestations of this evil conspiracy. It is particularly worth noting that U.N. Secretary-General U Thant's so-called "three-point plan" is essentially a different form of the U.S. "three-point proposal," serving the U.S. imperialists. Many Asian-African countries participating in the United Nations naturally express concern over the serious situation caused by U.S. aggression in Vietnam. However, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists cunningly attempt to use this legitimate concern to realize their outdated "peace talks" deception, creating a fait accompli for the United Nations to illegally intervene in the Vietnam issue. This sinister plot must be exposed.

The position of the Vietnamese people is clear. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have repeatedly pointed out that the only way to solve the Vietnam issue is to realize the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. In a word: The U.S. aggressors must stop their aggression in Vietnam, immediately and unconditionally withdraw all their troops and puppet armies, and dismantle all their military bases and facilities, allowing the Vietnamese people to solve their own problems.

We, the Afro-Asian writers, will continue to firmly support the correct position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, as well as Chairman Ho Chi Minh's famous letter to the Vietnamese people, and will fully expose the joint actions of the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries.

At a time when the U.S. imperialists are plotting further escalation and intensification of their aggression in Vietnam, the so-called "peace proposals" or "peace appeals" that equate the aggressors with the victims, regardless of their source, only mean that the Vietnamese people should lay down their weapons and surrender to the U.S. aggressors. In short, this is a betrayal of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Vietnamese people and the Asian-African peoples.

The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau calls on the Asian-African peoples to strongly condemn this "peace talks" conspiracy and strengthen their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

    亚非作家常设局指出“和谈”阴谋是美帝扩大侵越战争的烟幕
    强烈谴责美帝苏修合伙大搞“和谈”骗局
    所谓“和平”建议不管来自何处都是对越南人民反帝斗争的背叛
    新华社二十二日讯  亚非作家常设局发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义伙同苏联现代修正主义者在越南问题上大搞“和谈”骗局。声明全文如下：
    亚非作家常设局在观察了近来美国侵略越南战争的事态发展之后，认为有责任揭露美帝国主义与苏联现代修正主义领导集团相勾结共同策划的新阴谋：使美国对越南的罪恶占领永远存在下去。
    六月份在北京召开了支援越南和亚非人民民族解放斗争的亚非作家紧急会议，会议期间，美帝国主义轰炸了河内和海防。但是，这并没有挽救了美帝国主义在越南战场上的失败。
    每当美国侵略者在越南战场上面临着新的失败或阴谋扩大战争的时候，他们就大叫“和谈”。这已经变成了美国侵略者的惯例。
    最近，美国侵略者又想通过所谓停止轰炸，诱使越南人民接受“和谈”，放下他们的武器，美帝国主义正企图在谈判桌上得到他们在战场上得不到的东西。
    约翰逊政府的“和平攻势”是在两个海军陆战队师开到了非军事区附近，麦克纳马拉正在西贡忙于策划进一步扩大越南的战争升级的时候进行的。这一点清楚地证明：他们的“和谈”阴谋只不过是扩大侵越战争的烟幕而已。亚非作家和人民强烈谴责这个“升级——‘和谈’——再升级”的阴谋。
    值得注意的是，美国的“和平攻势”，正是在苏联外长葛罗米柯进出白宫的时候进行的。美帝苏修正在合谋这一肮脏的阴谋。在美帝的策划下，它的形形色色的走狗和追随者，正在为“和谈”骗局大卖力气。几个国家召开的所谓的“马尼拉会议”，英国外交大臣布朗提出了所谓的六点计划，梵蒂冈的“和平呼吁”，南斯拉夫和印度反动派的所谓不结盟的努力，也都是这种罪恶阴谋的各种表现形式。特别要指出的是，联合国秘书长吴丹提出的所谓“三点方案”，这完全是美国“三点建议”不同形式的翻版，是为美帝效劳的。参加联合国的许多亚非国家，对美国侵略越南所造成的严重局势表示关切是十分自然的，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义者却狡猾地企图利用这种理所当然的关心，来实现他们陈旧的“和谈”骗局，为联合国非法干预越南问题造成既成事实。这一个险恶的大阴谋必须揭露。
    越南人民的立场是一清二楚的。越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线一再指出，解决越南问题的唯一方法是实现越南民主共和国的四项主张，和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。一句话：美国侵略者必须停止在越南的侵略，立即全部和无条件地撤出它所有军队和仆从军，拆除他们所有军事基地和设施，让越南人民去解决他们自己的问题。
    我们亚非作家将继续坚定地支持越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线上述正确的立场，以及胡志明主席著名的告越南人民书，并将充分揭露美帝国主义者同现代修正主义者以及一切反动派的联合行动。
    在美帝国主义者策划进一步升级、加剧他们在越南的侵略的时候，将侵略者和被侵略者相提并论的所谓的“和平建议”或“和平呼吁”，不管来自何处，只不过意味着要越南人民放下武器，向美国侵略者屈服。总之，这是对越南人民也是对亚非人民反帝斗争的背叛。
    亚非作家常设局为此呼吁亚非人民，强烈地谴责这个“和谈”的大阴谋。加强支持越南人民抗美救国的斗争。
