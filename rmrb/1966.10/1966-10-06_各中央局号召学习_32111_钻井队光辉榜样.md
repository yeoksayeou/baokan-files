	Highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry forward the fearless and thorough revolutionary spirit
	All Central Bureaus Call for Learning from the Exemplary 32111 Drilling Team
	The bureaus urge people in all regions to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, to turn every industry into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to channel the surging enthusiasm into the Cultural Revolution and production and construction.

	According to a summary by Xinhua News Agency: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China have respectively issued notices or decisions on widely promoting and learning from the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team. These notices or decisions point out that carrying out this promotional and learning activity is of great significance in furthering the new upsurge of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, in furthering the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and in promoting the thought reform of the people and the new upsurge in production and construction.

	The notices or decisions of the six bureaus point out: The 32111 Drilling Team is a heroic collective that emerged in the high tide of the seven hundred million people in China studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat on the petroleum industry front. They bravely and tenaciously, one after another, fearlessly, and overcoming all difficulties, extinguished a raging fire, safeguarded state property and the people's interests with their lives and blood, and preserved a large gas well, creating a miraculous heroic feat. This is another triumphant song of the great Mao Zedong Thought resounding through the clouds.

	These notices or decisions say: The 32111 heroic drilling team, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is a collective Huang Jiguang, a collective Qiu Shaoyun, a collective Ouyang Hai, a collective Wang Jie, a collective Mai Xiande, a collective Liu Yingjun. They have boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. They have long persisted in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, regarding reading Chairman Mao's books as their first need in life, turning Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, truly achieving the goal of "imprinting Chairman Mao's instructions in the mind, dissolving them in the blood, and implementing them in actions," setting a brilliant example for us in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	The notices or decisions point out: The heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team once again vividly prove: Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a tremendous material force for transforming the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of revolutionary people. As long as revolutionary people possess this great soul, they will be the most noble, the bravest, the wisest, the most united, the most steadfast in their stance, and the most thorough in their revolution, daring to climb mountains of knives and to rush into seas of fire, and able to create miraculous feats that shake the heavens and the earth.

	The six bureaus respectively call on all party organizations, Communist Party members, workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary youth, and all revolutionary people in their regions to actively promote and seriously learn from the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They should, like the heroic drilling team, study Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings, turning Mao Zedong Thought into their soul, taking Chairman Mao's words as the guiding principles for all actions, regarding revolutionary interests as their first life, and being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to the Party, forever loyal to the people, and forever loyal to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. Through this promotional and learning activity, they should firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, strive to turn every industry into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought, and into a heroic collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

	The bureaus require the people in all regions to, like the heroic drilling team, highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry forward the fearless and thorough revolutionary spirit. In the current Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, they should resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to struggle, dare to make revolution, be good at struggling, be good at making revolution, trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and conscientiously, comprehensively, thoroughly, and unconditionally implement the Sixteen Points. They should grasp the general direction of the struggle, concentrate their forces to strike at a handful of rightist elements of the bourgeoisie and at those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, uproot the roots of revisionism, and ensure that the proletariat's iron-clad mountain will never change color. At the same time, they must take the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat as the key link, grasp both revolution and production, and channel the surging revolutionary enthusiasm into production struggles and scientific experiments, striving to fully and over-fulfill this year's state production and construction tasks, laying a solid foundation for the successful implementation of the country's third five-year plan, and making greater contributions to supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.
