Patriotic fighters in "Portuguese" Guinea grow stronger in battle

Over a thousand five hundred Portuguese colonial troops annihilated in one year

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Conakry: The patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea have annihilated over 1,500 Portuguese colonial troops in the past year, destroyed dozens of enemy vehicles, shot down three enemy planes, and seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and supplies.

Recently, the patriotic fighters of "Portuguese" Guinea used artillery to bombard the city of Bolama, occupied by the Portuguese colonialists on Bolama Island, for the first time. From September 3 to 9, the patriotic regular army and guerrillas launched multiple attacks on the Portuguese colonialists, causing significant casualties and material losses to the enemy.

On September 3, the patriotic regular army used heavy weapons to attack the Ampada military camp, destroying at least 90% of the camp's military facilities. Many colonialists were injured.

On September 5, a Portuguese enemy force, under the cover of jet planes, attempted to attack the patriotic base at Mansakenda but was ambushed and suffered heavy losses. Two Portuguese helicopters made seven trips to transport the dead and wounded. On the same day, guerrillas in the Kubissek region killed five Portuguese colonialists and wounded several others in another attack.

On September 9, a Portuguese enemy force from Bolama attempted to reoccupy the port of Bambaya in the Kubissek region but was fiercely attacked by two units of the patriotic regular army and local guerrillas. The Portuguese forces were besieged for twelve hours, leaving behind seventeen corpses and a large amount of military supplies and ammunition before fleeing in disarray.
