	Albanian "People's Voice" Warmly Congratulates the Success of Our Country's Missile Nuclear Weapon Launch
	Greatly Boosts the Morale of Revolutionary People
	Greatly Dismays the Arrogance of Imperialists, Revisionists, and Reactionaries

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 28th

	The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" today published an editorial on the success of our country's missile nuclear weapon test launch. The editorial pointed out that China's successful missile nuclear weapon test launch has great historical significance. This is a new contribution and great encouragement to the people of the world who are struggling for national independence, liberation, and the defense of true peace.

	The editorial said that China's three successful nuclear explosions in two years and this successful missile nuclear weapon test launch best prove the great leap forward in China's science and technology. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the workers, engineers, scientific workers, and the People's Liberation Army of China, by emphasizing politics, self-reliance, and striving for progress, have already and are pushing China's science and technology to the peak of modern world science and technology.

	The editorial said that in the current world situation, the further strengthening of China's national defense has particularly important international significance. Currently, the Johnson administration and the Soviet revisionist leaders are continuing to hastily conclude the dirty deal of "preventing nuclear proliferation" and are closely cooperating. The purpose of this new conspiracy is to maintain the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly in order to suppress and blackmail other countries and peoples, making them submit to the will of the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. China's successful missile nuclear weapon launch is a major support to the revolutionary people who are fighting against the threats and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

	The editorial emphasized that China's successful missile nuclear weapon test launch is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are resisting the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialism and to all revolutionary forces that love freedom; at the same time, it makes the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the CPSU leadership, as well as the reactionaries of various countries, feel deeply uneasy and discouraged.

	The editorial said that the purpose of China's development of nuclear weapons is to strengthen national defense, thoroughly break the nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and is beneficial to the guarantee of world peace.

	The editorial concluded by saying that the Albanian people feel boundless joy and pride for the historic new victory achieved by their comrades and brothers, the Chinese people, under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong. Our people warmly congratulate the glorious victory of the brotherly Chinese people.

    阿《人民之声报》热烈祝贺我导弹核武器发射成功
    大长革命人民志气　大灭帝修反的威风
    新华社地拉那二十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》今天就我国发射导弹核武器试验成功发表社论指出，中国发射导弹核武器试验成功具有重大的历史意义。这是对正在为争取民族独立、解放和保卫真正和平而斗争的全世界人民的一个新贡献和巨大鼓舞。
    社论说，中国在两年内三次核爆炸成功和这次发射导弹核武器试验成功最好地证明了中国科学技术的巨大跃进。在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下的工人、工程师、科学工作者以及中国人民解放军，由于突出政治，自力更生，奋发图强，已经和正在把中国的科学技术推向世界现代科学技术水平的高峰。
    社论说，在当前的世界形势下，中国国防力量的进一步增长具有特别重要的国际意义。目前约翰逊政府和苏联修正主义领导人正在继续进行尽速缔结“防止核扩散”的肮脏交易和紧密合作。这一新阴谋的目的在于保持美苏核垄断，以便压服和讹诈其他国家和人民，使他们屈从于苏美两大国的意旨。中国发射导弹核武器成功对正在同美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的威胁和阴谋进行斗争的革命人民是一个重大支持。
    社论强调指出，中国发射导弹核武器试验成功对正在反对美帝国主义野蛮侵略的英雄的越南人民和一切爱好自由的革命力量是一个巨大的鼓舞；同时，它使以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者以及各国反动派深感不安和沮丧。
    社论说，中国发展核武器的目的在于增强国防力量，彻底打破美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的核垄断，有利于保障世界和平。
    社论最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民为自己的战友和兄弟的中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下取得的这一历史性的新胜利而感到无限的喜悦和自豪。我国人民热烈祝贺兄弟的中国人民的这一辉煌的胜利。
