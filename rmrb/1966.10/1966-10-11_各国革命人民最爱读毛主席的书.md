The revolutionary people of all countries love to read Chairman Mao's books. Chairman Mao's books are treasures.

The people of Tanzania are eagerly studying Mao Zedong Thought. Many Tanzanian workers often study Chairman Mao's works during their rest time. Some workers not only read Chairman Mao's articles carefully themselves but also enthusiastically read them aloud to other workers in their spare time. They say, Chairman Mao's books are treasures, and they find Chairman Mao's words easy to understand.

A young worker obtained a small book containing several important talks between Chairman Mao and people from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He loves it dearly. Wherever he goes, he carries this small book with him. Once, when he was transferred to a new job, while packing his luggage, he put this small book into his bag first.

Fish cannot live without water.

The people of Algeria are eagerly demanding to study Chairman Mao's works. At the China Pavilion of the International Expo in Algiers, visitors are continuously buying and requesting Chairman Mao's works. An old Algerian worker, after purchasing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," told the exhibition hall staff: "We revolutionary people need Chairman Mao's works as urgently as a thirsty person needs water. I compare myself to a fish, and Chairman Mao's works are like water; a fish cannot live without water."

Another visitor, after obtaining a copy of Chairman Mao's works, affectionately kissed it and said, "Chairman Mao's works are the truths of revolution. To carry out revolution and construction, one must study Chairman Mao's works." He then shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Another veteran, Kherifali Slimane, who was injured during the Algerian War of Independence, came to the Chairman Mao's works reading room in a wheelchair to read Chairman Mao's works. After obtaining some single-volume books, he said, he had known Mao Zedong and loved him during the liberation war!

A doctor from Haiti, after purchasing "Selected Military Works of Mao Zedong," excitedly said: "Mao Zedong Thought is universally applicable." He also said, "Mao Zedong not only leads the Chinese people forward but also leads the people of the world, including the people of Haiti, forward. Despite the various restrictions imposed by American imperialism, progressive intellectuals in Haiti are now also reading 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' Mao Zedong Thought will definitely achieve victory throughout the world."

Truth cannot be blocked.

American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries are terrified by Mao Zedong Thought, and they desperately try to block it, but truth cannot be blocked. An American flew from the United States to Hong Kong. As soon as he got off the plane at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, he rushed to a bookstore to buy the English version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He told the bookstore clerk that due to the Johnson administration's persecution of progressive Americans, he could not see Chairman Mao's books in the United States. He wanted to read as much of Chairman Mao's books as possible in the three days he could stay in Hong Kong.

A bookstore in Hong Kong also received a letter from a Spanish friend. He wrote: The Spanish reactionary authorities extremely hate the revolutionary people, and whoever reads Chairman Mao's books will be put on the blacklist by the reactionary authorities, and their personal freedom will be restricted, and they may even be fired by the capitalists. However, revolutionary people still try every means to read Chairman Mao's books. He said, he had already been put on the blacklist by the reactionary authorities, but "the reactionary authorities can restrict my personal freedom but cannot obstruct my lofty ideals." A friend from Southeast Asia wrote to the bookstore: "No pressure can make me yield. As long as I can read Chairman Mao's books, I will not hesitate to pay any price, no matter how great."

### 各国革命人民最爱读毛主席的书

    各国革命人民最爱读毛主席的书
    毛主席的书是宝书
    坦桑尼亚人民如饥似渴地学习毛泽东思想。许多坦桑尼亚工人经常在休息时间学习毛主席著作。有些工人不仅自己认真阅读毛主席的文章，而且还在业余时间热情地向其他工人朗读。他们说，毛主席的书是宝书，毛主席的话他们容易懂。
    有一位青年工人得到一本毛主席同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人士的几次重要谈话的小册子，他喜爱极了。无论走到那里，他都随身带着这本小册子。有一次，他调动工作，在收拾行李时，他首先把这本小册子放到行李包里。
    鱼儿离不开水
    阿尔及利亚人民热烈要求学习毛主席著作。在阿尔及尔国际博览会中国馆中，购买和索取毛主席著作的观众络绎不绝。一位阿尔及利亚老工人在买到《毛泽东选集》后，对展览馆工作人员说：“我们革命人民需要毛主席著作就像非常口渴的人需要水一样的迫切，我把自己比作鱼，毛主席著作就好像是水，鱼离开水是不能活的。”
    另一位观众在索取了一本毛主席著作后，亲切地吻了吻，并且说：“毛主席的著作都是革命的真理，要进行革命和建设，就必须学习毛主席著作。”他接着高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    还有一位在阿尔及利亚解放战争中受了伤的前老战士凯里法利·斯利曼坐着手推车来到毛主席著作阅览室阅读毛主席著作。他在索取了一些单行本后说，他在解放战争时就了解毛泽东，热爱毛泽东！
    一位来自海地的医生在购买了《毛泽东军事文选》后兴奋地说：“毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的”。他还说：“毛泽东不仅领导中国人民前进，也领导世界人民、包括海地人民前进。尽管美帝国主义进行各种限制，但是海地进步知识分子现在也在阅读《毛泽东选集》。毛泽东思想肯定地要在全世界获得胜利”。
    真理是封锁不了的
    美帝国主义和各国反动派被毛泽东思想吓得发抖，它们拚命封锁毛泽东思想，但是，真理是封锁不了的。一个美国人从美国乘飞机到香港，他在香港启德机场一下飞机，就赶到书店买了英文版的《毛泽东选集》。他对书店的营业员说，由于约翰逊政府迫害美国进步人士，他在美国看不到毛主席的书。他要在香港只能停留三天的时间内尽量多读些毛主席的书。
    香港的书店还接到一位西班牙朋友的来信。他写道：西班牙反动当局极端仇视革命人民，谁要读毛主席的书，谁就要被反动当局列入黑名单，人身自由就要受到限制，甚至要被资本家解雇，但是革命人民还是千方百计要读毛主席的书。他说，他早已被反动当局列入黑名单，但是“反动当局尽管限制我的人身自由，绝不能阻挠我的崇高理想”。一位东南亚朋友给书店来信说：“任何压力都不能使我屈服，只要能读到毛主席的书，不管要付出多大的代价，我也在所不惜。”
