The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally led by Chairman Mao, is sweeping away the capitalist roaders within the Party and all ghosts and monsters with an irresistible force. Every time we achieve a new victory, we cannot help but shout, "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" With Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, we will forever march from victory to victory. From the color film of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary masses at Tiananmen, we see that Chairman Mao is in such good health. We are truly overjoyed and filled with confidence in victory.

Recently, batches of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country have come to Beijing, to Chairman Mao's side. To carry out revolutionary linkages, they have traveled thousands of miles to the capital of our great motherland without hesitation. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Beijing suburbs, welcome these revolutionary pioneers most enthusiastically and firmly support their revolutionary actions.

Our Dongsheng People's Commune mainly produces vegetables. To express our sentiments, we will produce more vegetables and supply them to the guests invited by Chairman Mao as quickly as possible, so that they can eat well and happily return to their battle stations, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better!

    毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正以排山倒海之势，横扫党内走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神。我们每获得一次新的胜利，就禁不住要高呼“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”有了毛主席的英明领导，我们将永远从胜利走向胜利。从毛主席在天安门接见红卫兵和革命群众的彩色纪录片中，我们看到毛主席他老人家那样健康，我们真是感到最大的幸福，充满了胜利的信心。
    最近，全国各地的红卫兵和革命师生一批批地来到北京，来到了毛主席身边。为了革命串连，他们不辞辛苦，千里迢迢地来到了伟大祖国的首都。我们北京郊区的贫下中农，最热烈地欢迎这批革命闯将，最坚决地支持他们的革命行动。
    我们东升人民公社以生产蔬菜为主。为了表达我们的心意，我们要生产更多的蔬菜，尽快供应给毛主席请来的客人，让他们吃饱、吃好，高高兴兴地回到自己的战斗岗位，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好！
