	Determined to Advance Side by Side in the Revolutionary Storms
	Wei Fengying Discusses Learning Chairman Mao's Works with Red Guards

	Wei Fengying said, Mao Zedong Thought is our soul, and we must learn it generation after generation and pass it down forever. She encouraged the Red Guards to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to push the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, October 22, Chairman Mao's model worker and exemplar of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, Wei Fengying, recently participated in a symposium with many Red Guards in the capital to discuss their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The Red Guards said they would definitely follow Wei Fengying's example, keeping Chairman Mao's works with them at all times, learning in struggle and applying in struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls, establish a proletarian worldview, and become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The Red Guards who participated in the symposium had seen the exhibition on Wei Fengying's advanced deeds at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall multiple times, and some had heard Wei Fengying's report. They all said Wei Fengying was truly a model worker of Chairman Mao and a model for Red Guards. Wei Fengying humbly said, without Mao Zedong Thought, without the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and without the collective wisdom, what could I have accomplished? It's like a pear blossom; the flower may be beautiful, but without the tree, it will wither and die and cannot bear fruit. If we separate from Mao Zedong Thought, we lose our soul and will go downhill. She turned to a Red Guard and said, we must study the passage on page 174 of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" repeatedly. Premier Zhou has repeatedly instructed us to study and deeply understand the great significance of this passage by Chairman Mao. Our "Red-Special Squad" has repeatedly studied and applied this teaching of Chairman Mao, received profound education, and gained tremendous strength. The Red Guard opened his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and, upon seeing the passage "Humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and advance," excitedly told Wei Fengying, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and advance forever, revolutionizing to the end.

	Wei Fengying solemnly said: The current proletarian cultural revolution is a sharp and complex class struggle. We must be armed with Mao Zedong Thought to achieve victory. Workers and Red Guard youths are like fruits on the same vine. Your fearless revolutionary spirit in charging against the old world gives us great encouragement. Our factory workers also fight against the authorities who oppose our innovations and walk the capitalist road, criticize bourgeois reactionary authorities, smash all old frameworks, and resolutely walk the path of China, manufacturing our own products. Wei Fengying also earnestly told the Red Guards: In struggle, we must arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle. No matter what demons and monsters, as long as we use the political microscope and telescope of Mao Zedong Thought to examine them, they will reveal their true forms. She said, Comrade Lin Biao calls on us to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We must resolutely respond to this great call. The enemy fears and opposes us the most when we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, so we must study Mao Zedong Thought even more, generation after generation, and pass it down forever.

	The Red Guard youths expressed their determination to learn from Comrade Wei Fengying. They vowed to read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Currently, they must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Wei Fengying also repeatedly told the Red Guards, we will study Chairman Mao's books together and advance side by side in the revolutionary storms.

    决心在革命的大风大浪中并肩前进
    尉凤英同红卫兵谈学习毛主席著作体会
    尉凤英说，毛泽东思想是我们的灵魂，要世世代代学，永远传下去。她勉励红卫兵响应林彪同志号召，把活学活用毛主席著作运动推向新阶段。
    据新华社二十二日讯　毛主席的好工人、活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样尉凤英，最近在一次座谈会上，同首都许多红卫兵一起畅谈活学活用毛主席著作的体会。红卫兵小将们说，我们一定要像尉凤英同志那样，毛主席著作不离身，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，树立无产阶级世界观，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    参加座谈的红卫兵，有的已经在北京美术展览馆看了十几次关于尉凤英先进事迹的展览，有的听过尉凤英的报告。他们都说尉凤英不愧是毛主席的好工人，是红卫兵的好榜样。尉凤英听了红卫兵的话，谦虚地说，离开毛泽东思想，没有党中央和毛主席的领导，没有集体的智慧，我能做出什么来呢？就像是一朵梨花，花虽然很好，可是离开了树就会枯死，就不能结果，我们如果离开毛泽东思想就没有了灵魂，就要走下坡路。她回过头，对一个红卫兵说，我们要好好学习《毛主席语录》一百七十四页上的一段话，周总理一再嘱咐我们要反复学习、深刻理解毛主席这段话的伟大意义。我们“红专大队”反复学用毛主席的这一教导，受到了深刻的教育，获得了巨大的力量。这个红卫兵打开《毛主席语录》本，看到“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”这段话时，激动地对尉凤英说，我们一定听毛主席的话，永远前进，革命到底。
    尉凤英严肃认真地说：当前这场无产阶级文化大革命是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。一定要用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能取得胜利。工人和红卫兵小将是一条藤上的瓜，你们向旧世界冲锋陷阵的大无畏的革命精神给我们很大鼓舞，我们厂工人也同反对我们搞革新的走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争，批判资产阶级反动权威，打碎了一切旧框框，坚决要走中国的道路，制造自己的产品。尉凤英还语重心长地告诉红卫兵：在斗争中一定要用毛主席的阶级斗争学说武装头脑，不管什么妖魔鬼怪，只要用毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜和望远镜一照，就现了原形。她说，林彪同志号召我们把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。我们要坚决响应这个伟大号召。敌人最怕我们也最反对我们掌握毛泽东思想，我们就越是要学习毛泽东思想，要世世代代学，永远传下去。
    红卫兵小将纷纷表示向尉凤英同志学习。要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。当前，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。尉凤英也一再对红卫兵说，我们共同学习毛主席的书，在革命的大风大浪中，共同携手前进。
