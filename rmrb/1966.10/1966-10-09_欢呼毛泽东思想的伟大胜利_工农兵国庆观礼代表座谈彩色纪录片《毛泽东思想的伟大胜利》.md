In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, advanced representatives from all fronts across the country, bearing the aspirations of the people of the whole country, gathered around our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, to celebrate the National Day together. At this moment, the color documentary "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought - Hail the Success of China's Three Nuclear Tests" was released. The editorial department of this newspaper invited some workers, peasants, and soldiers who came to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations, as well as active learners of Chairman Mao's works, to hold a symposium.

Heroes from all walks of life gathered together. They were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, like a surging river, pouring out their joyful sentiments. They had a thousand words and ten thousand words, passionately praising our greatest leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers who attended the National Day celebrations unanimously pointed out in their speeches that the film truthfully recorded how the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and self-strengthening, and with great leaps forward, successfully conducted three nuclear tests, dealing a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. The American imperialists' dream of nuclear hegemony burst like a soap bubble. The modern revisionists' plot to intimidate the revolutionary people of the world with nuclear terror was thoroughly smashed.

The representatives unanimously praised the success of the three nuclear tests as a manifestation of the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. They said: With Mao Zedong Thought, we can make atomic bombs. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all difficulties and accomplish anything.

The following are excerpts from the symposium.

**Editor's Note**

**Mao Zedong Thought Creates Miracles**

Zhou Wenhua (32111 Proletarian Revolutionary Heroism Drilling Team Leader, Five-Good Red Banner Holder):

The film "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought" once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is invincible. The film tells us that with Mao Zedong Thought, there will be atomic bombs. If the Chinese people all master Mao Zedong Thought, it is not just a matter of three atomic bombs, but having seven hundred million spiritual atomic bombs. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the greatest combat effectiveness, far surpassing the power of any atomic bomb by tens of thousands of times. The soldiers, workers, engineers, and scientific and technical personnel in the film, armed with this spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought, were able to break through the imperialists' and modern revisionists' blockade in a short period and create miracles.

We, the members of the 32111 team, mastered Mao Zedong Thought and dared to brave the fire. When I saw the mushroom cloud rising and the rolling smoke in the film, I thought of our drilling team's comrades fighting the fire. That day, in the rolling flames, we couldn't hear anyone speaking, and we couldn't see who was giving orders. But each of us knew that Chairman Mao is our supreme commander, and Mao Zedong Thought is directing our battle. We thought of Chairman Mao's instructions to find gas and oil, and we thought of protecting the state's property. One person fell, and another batch rushed forward. This is how we, with our blood and lives, extinguished the great fire.

With Mao Zedong Thought, atomic bombs can explode; with Mao Zedong Thought, all difficulties can be overcome; with Mao Zedong Thought, any human miracle can be created. We must take the action of fighting the fire as a new starting point, learn from the PLA, learn from Daqing and Dazhai, learn from the Red Guards, and learn from the people in the film. We must always keep Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We must greatly increase the drilling speed, quickly catch the "gas tiger," and meet the needs of socialist construction and support the revolutionary people of the whole world.

**Boosting the Morale of Revolutionary People**

Yang Huaiyuan (Model Learner of Chairman Mao's Works on the Transportation Front, Deputy Political Commissar of Shanghai Wheel Ship Company's Minzhu No. 5 Ship):

The film "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought" is excellent. It greatly boosts the morale of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and it greatly dampens the arrogance of imperialism and modern revisionism. After watching the film, I was particularly moved, with a thousand words and ten thousand words to say. The success of the three atomic bombs has made the Chinese people and the people of the whole world hold their heads high, and the American imperialists and modern revisionists are trembling with fear. Their nuclear monopoly, nuclear terror, and nuclear blackmail have completely collapsed in these three explosions.

After watching this film, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's judgment that atomic bombs are also paper tigers is completely correct. In the face of heroic people, atomic bombs are not frightening. The revisionists' talk about atomic bombs "destroying humanity and everything" is all lies.

**The Spiritual Atomic Bomb Has the Greatest Power**

Xing Yanzi (National People's Congress Representative, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Sigezhuang Brigade, Dazhuang Commune, Baodi County, Hebei Province, and a returned intellectual who has long settled in the countryside):

The success of the three atomic bombs shows the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Imperialism and modern revisionism desperately tried to isolate us and intimidate us. They thought we could do nothing and accomplish nothing, but we have given them a powerful rebuttal with ironclad facts.

**The Spiritual Atomic Bomb Has the Greatest Power**

Huang Shunyu (National People's Congress Representative, Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in Jilin Province, Secretary of the Party Branch of Dongsheng Brigade, Dongsheng Commune, Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture):

After watching the film of the three atomic bomb explosions, I was very happy. This film tells us that the power of material atomic bombs is not the greatest; the greatest power is the spiritual atomic bomb. Now, we have the spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought and the material atomic bomb. Our power is even greater, and the power of the world revolution is also greater. We will definitely thoroughly defeat American imperialism and modern revisionism.

**Zhang Daolu (Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in Shenyang Military Region, Inventor of the Coal-Saving Stove Method, Deputy Commissar of the Third Company of a Certain Unit):**

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and self-strengthening, relying entirely on their own design and manufacturing, and in a very short period, have broken through the heavy blockade of imperialism and modern revisionism, finally achieving the great victory of three successful nuclear tests. This fully proves that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have spirit, ideals, and power. We are invincible in the world. The Chinese government has repeatedly declared that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances. However, we must warn the imperialists that if they dare to impose war on us, we will definitely break their backs and thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate them!

There is no difficulty in the world, only those who dare to try. As long as we have confidence and determination, we can overcome any difficulty. Our people, under conditions where scientific and technological equipment is not so perfect, were able to successfully conduct nuclear tests three times in a short period. This is because we actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works and seriously followed Chairman Mao's instructions. In the aspect of saving coal, I broke the framework of bourgeois "authorities" and achieved some small results, which is also the result of learning Chairman Mao's works.

**Thousands of Victories, Tens of Thousands of Victories, All Are the Great Victories of Mao Zedong Thought**

Chen Yongkang (National People's Congress Representative, National Famous Agricultural Labor Model, and Peasant Scientist):

The success of China's atomic bomb explosion is the victory of the general line, the victory of self-reliance. Thousands of victories, tens of thousands of victories, all are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

From the life reflected in the film, we see a prominent feature, which is that the political atmosphere is very strong. Slogans are posted on the tents, and quotations are hung on the walls. The soldiers seize every minute and second to study Chairman Mao's works. They take Chairman Mao's books with them, rush into the atomic explosion area, fearing neither death nor hardship, and conduct combat exercises, achieving one victory after another. Seeing this, my heart is warm. Chairman Mao's book is truly a revolutionary treasure! Although I am not well-educated and my level is low, Chairman Mao's book is easy to understand, the more I listen, the more I like it, and the more I study, the more I like it. We peasants read Chairman Mao's book, which is to use what and learn what.

In the past, we farmed to have something to eat, and one mu of land could only produce four or five hundred jin. We never even thought of producing a thousand jin per mu. Chairman Mao told us to farm for the revolution, to produce more grain, to support socialist construction, and to support the revolutionary people of the world. These words made us see clearly. Once the ideology is clear, enthusiasm comes. Everyone gets up early and works late, engaging in scientific farming. Now we can plant two or three crops a year, and one mu of land can produce more than two thousand jin of grain.

This year, we also went to Subei to plant demonstration fields. In the past, rice was planted there, with a yield of only two or three hundred jin per mu. We took Chairman Mao's books and the revolutionary spirit of daring to venture and daring to do, leveled the fields, and applied enough fertilizer. We immediately planted more than ten mu of double-crop rice, and the average yield of the first season reached one thousand and thirteen jin per mu.

We must strive for higher yields, revolutionize to the end, study until old age, work until old age, and transform until old age. We must definitely serve the people better in the latter half of our lives and dedicate everything to the revolution. To achieve this, we must resolutely learn from the PLA, workers, and scientific and technical personnel in the film, and wholeheartedly and actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works.

**The Success of the Three Atomic Bombs Once Again Proves the Truth That People Are the Decisive Factor**

Xu Yongjiang (Heroic Boat Captain who sank the Chiang Kai-shek's "Jianmen" ship in the "August 6" naval battle last year, First-Class Meritorious Warrior):

After watching the film, I was deeply moved and inspired. The success of the three atomic bombs is the glorious victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Our motherland, in such a short time, has created such a great miracle, which vividly proves the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and proves the truth that people are the decisive factor, as Chairman Mao said.

The success of the three atomic bombs is like this, and our "August 6" naval battle last year is also like this. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek's warships were dozens of times larger than ours, and their cannons were much larger than ours. We, on the other hand, only used some small boats and small cannons, and most of the soldiers were young conscripts who had never fought a naval battle before. However, our soldiers were armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and they were the bravest and fearless of death. Therefore, as soon as the battle began, our soldiers first completely suppressed the enemy spiritually. In the fierce battle, although shells were flying over our heads and shrapnel was whizzing past our bodies, everyone remained calm, with a full chest of class hatred and Chairman Mao's teachings in their minds. Everyone dared to fight and dare to die, daring to fight close-quarters and night battles, truly doing their best in the face of light injuries and not leaving their positions in the face of heavy injuries. After several hours of continuous and tenacious fighting, we finally sank the American-made Chiang Kai-shek's large anti-submarine ship "Jianmen," achieving a brilliant victory.

**Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Revolutionary Enthusiasm Is Great**

Lv Yulan (Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in Hebei Province, Secretary of the Party Branch of Dongliushan Brigade, Xianxi County):

After watching this film, I further understood the truth that spirit can change into matter. The people participating in the nuclear tests all actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, so they became smarter and more powerful. In the future, we must learn from these heroes and catch up.

In recent years, we peasants have responded to the Party's call, taking the PLA as an example, and launched a campaign to study Chairman Mao's works extensively. Since our brigade launched the high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works, the spiritual outlook of the community members has changed greatly. Now, everyone in the whole brigade has Chairman Mao's books, and everyone wears quotation badges. Many illiterate old men and women can recite many quotations. Some old women participated in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and said that now every hoe and sickle is for the revolution, preparing for war and famine for the people! A sixty-year-old man engaged in high-yield experimental fields and also understood that farming well and producing more grain is to serve the people, to support the socialist construction of the motherland, and to support the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world.

Once the ideological awareness is raised, the enthusiasm for production is great. This year, the grain and cotton yields of our brigade have increased compared to last year. The community members said: People listen to Chairman Mao's words, the land listens to people's words, people change, the land changes, and the yield changes.

Now, we peasants also follow Chairman Mao's instructions to criticize the bourgeoisie. The community members actively write articles criticizing revisionist elements and reactionary academic "authorities" who are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. Now, everyone says: We must study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, transform our thoughts for a lifetime, engage in class struggle for a lifetime, and do revolution for a lifetime.

**Yuan Zhaoxiang (Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in a Certain Unit of the Air Force, Deputy Squadron Leader):**

This film has given me great education and enlightenment. It tells us that we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at any time. In this regard, I also have deep feelings. Chairman Mao's words must be listened to in times of difficulty and danger. Last year, during a flight, the equipment malfunctioned, and I had to make an emergency landing. The plane was about to hit the ground when I discovered that there were about a dozen community members working in the field. What to do? At that moment, the images of heroes like Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune flashed before my eyes, and Chairman Mao's warm teachings echoed in my ears: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses for a moment; everything should be based on the interests of the people..." I would rather die myself than let the people live. Thinking this, I stepped on the right rudder and pushed the stick, turning sharply to the right, letting the plane crash into the hillside. Although I was seriously injured, I saved the lives of the community members.

**Establish Proletarian Ambition**

Song Tongtai (Representative of the Four-Good Company of the Engineering Corps that has long been fighting on the border, Political Instructor):

I saw in the film that the soldiers, in the midst of strong winds and flying sand, still firmly guarded their posts while studying Chairman Mao's works. Our company has been fighting on the border for seventeen years, completing various tasks assigned by the Party in wind and rain, relying on studying Chairman Mao's works and the hard-working spirit of heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Last October, we went to the "high mountains where geese cannot fly and ice seals cannot cross" Bai Gu Mountain for construction, which was a season of strong winds and severe cold, with no water to drink, no firewood to burn, no food to eat, and no sleep. However, the soldiers studied "Abolish Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and everyone said: You have hard soil, and I have a strong will. In this way, we finally built the first Happy Road on Bai Gu Mountain at the fastest speed.

**Li Jirong (Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in the Tianjin Textile System, Worker of Tianjin Sixin Silk Mill):**

The success of the atomic bomb explosion reflected in the film proves that as long as there is revolutionary ambition, anything can be done. I have also felt this in my work. I am a textile worker who entered the factory in 1958. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood that I should spin for the revolution, and work is to solve the clothing problem of seven hundred million people, and also to support the world's revolutionary people. I established revolutionary ambition, practiced hard skills, and created the highest level of spinning in Tianjin. I deeply feel that being able to achieve this level of success is because Mao Zedong Thought plays a decisive role. I am determined to better study Chairman Mao's works, be humble and eager to learn, and strive to do more work for the people and contribute more strength.

**Li Lanjun (Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in the National Defense Science and Technology Commission System of the People's Liberation Army):**

The film tells us that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it can turn into a great material force. We must defeat American imperialism, mainly relying on the spiritual atomic bomb and Mao Zedong Thought.

I will humbly learn from the PLA, workers, and scientific and technical personnel who participated in the nuclear tests, and from the heroes of the 32111 drilling team, and always adhere to the "five unchanging principles": actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, being an ordinary soldier, maintaining a simple and frugal style, humbly learning and uniting with the masses, and emphasizing politics and combining red with expertise.

**Hail China's Great Leap Forward in Science and Technology**

Wang Amu (Political Instructor of the 32111 Proletarian Revolutionary Heroism Drilling Team, Five-Good Red Banner Holder):

The success of the three atomic bombs is a great joy for the people of the whole country and a great joy for the revolutionary people of the whole world. I hail the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought a thousand times, ten thousand times, and hail the new level of China's science and technology and industrial development. With atomic bombs, the Chinese people hold their heads high, and the revolutionary people of the world are also delighted and celebrate together.

The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and most capable. We must have what foreigners have, and we must also create what foreigners do not have. We dare to take paths that others have not taken and dare to climb peaks that others have not climbed. In the film, we can see that from the success of the first atomic bomb explosion to the nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, it only took a little over a year. This great leap forward speed far exceeds that of all imperialists. This fully proves that our national defense industry is powerful, and our scientific and technological level has made a leap forward and improvement.

**People Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Are the Smartest**

Liu Changrui (National People's Congress Representative, Industrial Labor Model of Heilongjiang Province, Worker Engineer of Jiamusi City Construction Company, and Mason Group Leader):

The ironclad fact of the three successful atomic bomb explosions fully proves that those who master Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, bravest, and most creative. Although China's science and technology are not very developed, we can conduct nuclear explosions containing thermonuclear materials at a much faster speed than British and American imperialism, mainly because of the thought revolution of people, daring to venture, daring to do, and daring to revolution. Our mason group is also because, under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have learned Chairman Mao's works, changed our spiritual outlook, and realized that every brick and tile we lay is a contribution to socialism. Therefore, for more than ten years, we have been continuously rated as an advanced collective.

We deeply understand that it is not enough to just focus on construction. We must never forget class struggle. In the current situation, in addition to seizing the gun, we must also seize the pen. Without the pen, we will lose the gun. After the Cultural Revolution began, we actively participated in this class struggle. I personally wrote more than twenty articles, criticizing bourgeois rightists and reactionary academic "authorities."

    欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    ——工农兵国庆观礼代表座谈彩色纪录片《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，我国各个战线上的先进代表们，带着全国人民的心意，来到我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席的身边，共同欢度国庆节。正在这个时候，彩色纪录片《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利——欢呼我国三次核试验成功》上映了。本报编辑部邀请部分来京观礼的工农兵代表和学习毛主席著作积极分子，举行了座谈会。
    各路英雄，欢聚一堂。他们满怀革命豪情，像滔滔不绝的江水，倾吐自己喜悦的心情。他们千言万语，热情地歌颂我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    工农兵观礼代表们在发言中一致指出，影片真实地纪录了我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，发扬了奋发图强、自力更生的精神，以大跃进的速度，成功地进行了三次核试验，给了帝国主义和现代修正主义以沉重的打击。美帝国主义的核霸王美梦，像肥皂泡一样破灭了。现代修正主义妄图用核恐怖来恫吓世界革命人民的阴谋，也被彻底粉碎了。
    代表们一致颂扬三次核试验的成功，显示了毛泽东思想的无比威力。他们说：有了毛泽东思想，我们能造出原子弹。有了毛泽东思想，一切困难我们都能够克服，什么事情我们都能够办好。
    下面发表的是座谈会的一部分发言。
     ——编者
    毛泽东思想创造奇迹
    周文华（32111无产阶级革命英雄主义钻井队队长、五好红旗手）：
    影片《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》，再一次证明了毛泽东思想是战无不胜的。影片告诉我们，有了毛泽东思想，就会有原子弹。中国人民都掌握了毛泽东思想，这就不只是三颗原子弹的问题，而是有了七亿颗精神原子弹。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人具有最大的战斗力，比什么原子弹的威力都强大千倍万倍。影片里的解放军、工人、工程科学技术人员，掌握了毛泽东思想这个精神原子弹，所以能在很短的时间内，打破帝国主义和现代修正主义的封锁，创造出人间奇迹。
    我们32111队的同志，掌握了毛泽东思想，才敢于闯火海。当我从影片里看到蘑菇云上天，看到那滚滚的烟云，我就想起了我们钻井队同志们血战火海的情景。那一天，在滚滚的火海中，听不到说话声，看不清谁在指挥。但我们每个人都清楚，毛主席是我们的最高统帅，毛泽东思想在指挥我们作战。我们想到的是毛主席要我们找气找油的指示，想到的是要保卫国家财产。一个人倒下去，一批人跟上来。我们就是这样用鲜血和生命扑灭了这场大火。
    有了毛泽东思想，原子弹能够爆炸；有了毛泽东思想，一切困难能够克服；有了毛泽东思想，任何人间奇迹都能创造。我们要以血战火海的行动作为新的起点，向解放军学习，向大庆、大寨学习，向红卫兵小将学习，向影片中的人们学习，永远把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。我们要大大提高钻井速度，尽快捉住“气老虎”，满足国家社会主义建设需要，支援全世界革命人民。
    大长革命人民的志气
    杨怀远（交通战线学习毛主席著作标兵、上海轮船公司民主五号轮副政委）：
    《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》这部电影好得很。它大长中国人民和世界革命人民的志气，大灭帝国主义、现代修正主义的威风。我看了电影后，心情特别激动，有千言万语要说。三颗原子弹的爆炸成功，中国人民和全世界人民扬眉吐气，美帝国主义和现代修正主义害怕得发抖。它们的核垄断、核恐怖、核讹诈，在这三声巨响中彻底地破产了。
    看了这部影片以后，我深深地体会到毛主席关于原子弹也是纸老虎的论断是完全正确的。在英雄人民面前，原子弹并不可怕。修正主义者胡说什么原子弹“会毁灭人类，毁灭一切”，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    邢燕子（全国人民代表大会代表、河北省宝坻县大中村公社司各庄大队党支部副书记、长期在农村落户的回乡知识青年）：
    三颗原子弹的爆炸成功，显示了毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。帝国主义和现代修正主义者，拚命想孤立我们，吓倒我们，他们以为我们什么也做不成，什么也做不好，我们却用铁的事实给了它们有力的回击。
    精神原子弹能量最大
    黄顺玉（全国人民代表大会代表、吉林省学习毛主席著作积极分子、延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县东盛公社东盛大队党支部书记）：
    看了三次原子弹爆炸的影片，心里非常高兴。这部影片告诉我们，物质的原子弹并不是最大的力量，最大的力量是精神原子弹。现在，我们有了毛泽东思想这个精神原子弹，又有了物质原子弹，我们的力量就更加强大了，世界革命力量也更加强大了，我们一定能够彻底地斗垮美帝国主义和现代修正主义。
    张道路（沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、创造改灶节煤烧火法的某部三连司务长）：
    我国人民在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，完全依靠自己设计、自己制造，在一个很短的时间内，粉碎帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重封锁，终于取得了三次核试验成功的巨大胜利。这充分地说明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民有志气、有理想、有力量。我们是无敌于天下的。我国政府多次声明：中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。但是，我们必须警告帝国主义者，如果胆敢把战争强加在我们的头上，我们一定要打断侵略者的脊骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭掉！
    天下无难事，只怕有心人。我们只要有信心，有决心，任何困难都可以克服。我国人民在科学技术设备并不那么完善的条件下，能在短期内三次成功地进行核试验，这是因为活学活用毛主席著作、认真按照毛主席指示去做的结果。我在节约用煤方面打破了资产阶级“权威”的框框，取得一点微小的成绩，也是学习毛主席著作的结果。
    千胜利，万胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    陈永康（全国人民代表大会代表、全国著名农业劳动模范、农民科学家）：
    我国原子弹爆炸成功，是总路线的胜利，是自力更生方针的胜利。千胜利，万胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    从影片所反映的生活中，我们看到一个显著的特点，就是政治空气很浓。帐篷上贴着标语，墙上挂着语录板，战士们抓紧一分一秒时间学习毛主席著作。他们带着毛主席的书，冲进原子爆炸地区，不怕死、不怕苦，进行战斗演习，取得了一个又一个胜利。看到这里，我心里热呼呼的。毛主席的书真是革命的宝啊！我虽然文化浅、水平低，但毛主席的书一听就懂，越听越爱听，越学越爱学。我们农民读毛主席的书，就是用什么、学什么。
    以前，我们种田是为了有的吃，一亩田只能打个四、五百斤，亩产千斤连想也没想过。毛主席告诉我们，要为革命种田，要多打粮食，支援社会主义建设，支援世界革命人民。这些话说得我们心里透亮。思想通了，积极性就来了，大家起早落夜，搞科学种田。现在可以种二季、三季，一亩田可以年产二千多斤粮食。
    今年我们还到苏北去种样板田，以前那里种水稻，亩产只有二、三百斤。我们带去了毛主席的书，带去了敢闯、敢干的革命精神，把田整得平平的，把肥施得足足的，一下就试种了十多亩双季稻，第一季度平均亩产达到一千零十三斤。
    我们就是要高产更高产，要革命到底，要学到老，做到老，改造到老，一定要在后半辈子为人民服务得更好，为革命献出一切。我们要做到这些，就必须下决心像电影里的解放军、工人和工程科学技术人员一样，全心全意地活学活用毛主席著作。
    三颗原子弹的爆炸，再一次证明了人的因素第一的真理
    许永江（在去年“八·六”海战中击沉蒋帮军舰“剑门号”的英雄艇艇长、一等功臣）：
    看了电影，很受感动和鼓舞。三颗原子弹的爆炸，是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。我们祖国，在这么短的时间里，就创造了这么大的奇迹，这就生动地证明了毛泽东思想的无穷威力，证明了毛主席说的人的因素第一的真理。
    三颗原子弹的爆炸成功是这样，我们去年“八·六”海战也是这样。当时，蒋匪帮的军舰比我们的大几十倍，炮也比我们的大得多。我们呢，只用了一些小艇小炮，而且战士大部分是年青的义务兵，从来没有打过海战。但是，我们的战士是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，他们最勇敢、最不怕死。所以，战斗一开始，我们的战士首先就在精神上完全压倒了敌人。在激烈的战斗中，尽管炮弹在头上飞，弹片从身边擦过，但大家脸不变色心不跳，胸膛里是满腔的阶级仇恨，脑子里想的是毛主席的教导。个个敢打敢拚，敢于打近战、打夜战，真正做到了轻伤不叫苦，重伤不离战位。经过几个小时的连续顽强的战斗，终于击沉了美制蒋帮大型猎潜舰“剑门号”，取得了辉煌的战果。
    听毛主席的话，革命干劲大
    吕玉兰（河北省学习毛主席著作积极分子、临西县下堡寺公社东留善固大队党支部书记）：
    看了这部电影，使我更进一步地理解了精神可以变物质的道理。参加核试验的人员，人人都活学活用毛主席著作，所以就变得更聪明，更有力量。俺们今后要好好地向这些英雄们学习，要迎头赶上。
    近年来，俺们农民响应党的号召，以解放军为榜样，开展了大学毛主席著作运动。俺队自从掀起学习毛主席著作的高潮以来，社员的精神面貌起了很大变化。现在全大队人人有毛主席的书，个个戴语录牌。许多不识字的老汉、老大娘都能背出许多条语录。有的老大娘参加了毛主席著作学用会，就说现在一锄一镰为革命，备战备荒为人民！六十多岁的老汉搞高产试验田，也懂得种好田多打粮食是为人民服务，为支援祖国社会主义建设，为支援世界人民的革命斗争。
    思想觉悟提高了，生产的干劲就大了。今年俺队的粮食、棉花产量都比去年提高了。社员们说：人听毛主席的话，地听人的话，人变地变，产量也变。
    现在，俺们农民也按照毛主席的指示，批判资产阶级。社员们积极写文章批判反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”。现在社员们个个都说：要学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，搞一辈子阶级斗争，干一辈子革命。
    袁兆祥（空军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子、飞行副中队长）：
    这部影片给我的教育和启发很大。它告诉我们，任何时候都要听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。在这方面，我也有深切的体会。毛主席的话，平时要听，在困难危急的时候尤其要听。去年，在一次飞行时，机件失灵，被迫降落。飞机快接近地面了，我才发现有十几个社员正在田野里劳动。怎么办？当时我眼前闪现出张思德、白求恩等英雄形象，耳边响起了毛主席的亲切教导：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发……”。我宁愿自己死，也要群众活。想到这里，我向右蹬舵、压杆，往右急转，让飞机迎着山坡冲去。虽然我因此受了重伤，但保全了社员的生命。
    要树立无产阶级的雄心壮志
    宋同太（长期战斗在祖国边疆的工程兵四好连队代表、指导员）：
    我从电影上看到战士们学了毛主席著作，在狂风大作、飞沙走石中，依然坚守工作岗位的情景，感到非常亲切。我们连队转战边疆十七年来，在风里雨里完成党交给我们的各项任务，就是靠学习毛主席著作，靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄们的艰苦奋斗精神。去年十月，我们到“山高雁难飞、冰封猴难过”的白骨山施工，正是狂风漫天、天寒地冻的季节，没有水喝，没有柴烧，吃不上饭，睡不着觉。但是，战士们学习了《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》和《愚公移山》等文章，大家就说：你有坚硬的土壤，我有过硬的思想。这样，终于以最快的速度在白骨山上修出了第一条幸福大道。
    李基荣（天津纺织系统学习毛主席著作积极分子、天津四新纱厂工人）：
    影片所反映的原子弹爆炸成功的事实证明，只要有革命的雄心壮志，任何事情都是可以办到的。这一点我在自己的工作中也有体会。我是一九五八年进厂的纺织工人。学习了毛主席著作以后，我懂得了要为革命而纺纱，做工是为了解决七亿人民的穿衣问题，也是为了支援世界人民革命。我树立了雄心壮志，苦练过硬本领，创造了天津市纺纱看台的最高水平。我深深体会到，能够取得这一点成绩，是毛泽东思想起着决定性的作用。我决心更好地学习毛主席著作，戒骄戒躁，努力为人民多做一点工作，多贡献一点力量。
    李兰君（中国人民解放军国防科委系统学习毛主席著作积极分子）：
    影片告诉我们，毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就能变成巨大的物质力量。我们要战胜美帝国主义，主要是靠精神原子弹、靠毛泽东思想。
    我要虚心地向参加核试验的解放军、工人和工程科学技术人员学习，向32111钻井队的勇士们学习，永远做到“五不变”：活学活用毛主席著作不变，做普通一兵不变，保持艰苦朴素作风不变，虚心学习、团结群众不变，突出政治、以红带专不变。
    欢呼我国科学技术大跃进
    王阿毛（32111无产阶级革命英雄主义钻井队政治指导员、五好红旗手）：
    三颗原子弹的爆炸成功，是全国人民的大喜事，是全世界革命人民的大喜事。我一千遍、一万遍地欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，欢呼我国科学技术和工业发展的新水平。有了原子弹，中国人民扬眉吐气，世界革命人民也欢欣鼓舞，同声庆贺。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民最聪明、最能干。外国人有的我们要有，外国人没有的我们也要制造出来。我们敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。在影片里，我们可以看到从第一颗原子弹的爆炸成功，到进行含有热核材料的核爆炸，仅仅用了一年多的时间。这种大跃进的速度，大大超过了一切帝国主义。这充分说明了我们的国防工业是强大的，我们的科学技术水平得到了飞跃的发展和提高。
    毛泽东思想武装的人最聪明
    刘长瑞（全国人民代表大会代表、黑龙江省工业劳动模范、佳木斯市建筑公司工人工程师、瓦工组长）：
    三次原子弹爆炸成功的铁的事实，充分证明掌握了毛泽东思想的人最聪明、最勇敢、最富于创造性。我国的科学技术还不很发达，但是能够以比美、英帝国主义快得多的速度进行含有热核材料的核爆炸，主要是人的思想革命化，敢闯、敢干、敢革命的结果。我们瓦工小组也是由于在党和毛主席的教导下，学习了毛主席著作，精神面貌变了，认识到多砌一块砖一片瓦，就是为社会主义出一点力的道理，所以十多年来，连续被评为先进集体。
    我们深深懂得，只埋头搞建设是不行的，千万不可忘记阶级斗争。在当前，除了抓枪杆子外，还要抓笔杆子。没有笔杆子就要失掉枪杆子。文化大革命开始以后，我们积极投入了这场阶级斗争，我个人就写了二十多篇文章，批判资产阶级右派和反动学术“权威”。
