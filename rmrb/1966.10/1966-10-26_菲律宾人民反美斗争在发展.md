The Filipino people's struggle against American imperialism is developing. The head of American imperialism, Johnson, gathered a group of accomplices and lackeys to hold a meeting in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, on October 24, plotting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. This meeting has been strongly opposed by the Filipino people.

A chorus of anger drives away the plague

Even before the meeting began, the Filipino people had already expressed their opposition. Many Filipino newspapers pointed out that this meeting was a war conference, opposing the Philippines acting as a henchman for the United States in its aggression against Vietnam. One hundred student leaders from the University of the Philippines issued a declaration opposing the Manila meeting, pointing out that the only way to peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue is for the United States and its henchmen to immediately withdraw their invading troops.

On the evening of October 23, the plague carrier Johnson arrived in Manila. That night, a group of students demonstrated in front of the hotel where he was staying, angrily denouncing Johnson as a war criminal.

On the evening of the 24th, several thousand Filipino students held a massive anti-American demonstration, angrily protesting the U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam. They carried torches, flags, and placards, chanting slogans in front of the U.S. embassy and the hotel where Johnson was staying. The placards read, "Down with the American aggressors!" "Johnson, go back!" The Philippine military police opened fire on the demonstrating students, but met with fierce resistance.

Opposing American imperialist control of the Philippines

The Filipino people have always strongly opposed the aggressive policies of American imperialism.

In 1898, the Philippines became a U.S. colony. It was not until 1946 that it gained independence. However, the United States signed several unequal treaties with the Philippines, allowing the United States to continue to control the Philippines as before. According to these treaties, Americans in the Philippines have the right to mine, operate factories, establish companies, and control the Philippines' foreign trade and important economic sectors, just like Filipinos. The national capital of the Philippines has been squeezed out and attacked, causing large-scale unemployment among workers. The lives of the Filipino people are very miserable.

The United States has many military bases in the Philippines. Currently, there are 100,000 U.S. troops stationed at these bases. U.S. soldiers in the Philippines commit all kinds of crimes but are not subject to Philippine law.

The U.S. imperialist aggression against the Philippines has aroused the resistance of the Filipino people, and their awareness in the struggle has been increasingly heightened. The Filipino people have repeatedly launched anti-American struggles, opposing the United States' strangling of the Philippine national economy, opposing U.S. military bases, and demanding the abolition of all unequal treaties signed with the United States.

Not becoming cannon fodder for U.S. aggression in Vietnam

American imperialism has always regarded the Philippines as an important base for encircling China and invading Vietnam. Most of the troops and military supplies sent by the United States to South Vietnam pass through the Philippines. The wounded U.S. invading troops in South Vietnam are also sent to the Philippines for treatment. Many of the U.S. planes bombing the liberated areas of Vietnam and Laos take off from the Philippines. Now, in order to expand the war of aggression, the United States is frantically expanding military bases and sending more U.S. troops to the Philippines.

The reactionary forces in the Philippines have become accomplices in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam. At the beginning of this year, the Philippine reactionaries, despite the people's opposition, decided to send 2,000 cannon fodder to South Vietnam to assist the U.S. aggression. This batch of cannon fodder has already been sent to South Vietnam in batches.

In the first half of last year, the Filipino people held six large-scale anti-American demonstrations. At the beginning of this year, a new anti-American storm was stirred up, with demonstrations in many cities where the crowds angrily shouted, "Yankee go home!" "Don't send Filipinos to Vietnam!"

Chairman Mao has pointed out that Western bourgeoisie in the East have created two types of people: "One type is the minority who serve imperialism as compradors; the other type is the majority who resist imperialism, including the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and the intelligentsia from these classes. All these are the gravediggers that imperialism has created for itself, and revolution arises from these people." The Philippines is another noose around the neck of U.S. imperialism. As the Filipino people's anti-American struggle continues to develop, this noose is being pulled tighter and tighter.

### 菲律宾人民反美斗争在发展

    菲律宾人民反美斗争在发展
    美帝国主义头子约翰逊纠集了一伙帮凶走狗，十月二十四日在菲律宾的首都马尼拉开会，策划扩大侵越战争的阴谋。这个会议遭到了菲律宾人民的强烈反对。
    一片怒吼驱瘟神
    还在开会以前，菲律宾人民就纷纷反对。许多菲律宾报纸指出这次会议是一个战争会议，反对菲律宾给美国充当侵略越南的帮凶。菲律宾大学一百名学生领袖发表宣言，反对马尼拉会议，指出和平解决越南问题的办法只有一个，就是：立即撤出美国和它的帮凶的侵略军。
    十月二十三日，瘟神约翰逊到了马尼拉。当天晚上，就有一群学生到他住的饭店前面示威，愤怒谴责约翰逊是战犯。
    二十四日晚上，几千名菲律宾学生，又举行了声势浩大的反美示威，愤怒抗议美帝国主义侵略越南。他们举着火把、旗帜和标语牌，高呼口号，到美国大使馆和约翰逊住的饭店前面示威。标语牌上写着“打倒美国侵略者！”“约翰逊，滚回去！”菲律宾军警开枪镇压示威学生，遭到学生的英勇抵抗。
    反对美帝控制菲律宾
    菲律宾人民一向强烈地反对美帝国主义的侵略政策。
    一八九八年，菲律宾成了美国的殖民地。一九四六年才独立。但是，美国同菲律宾签订了好几个不平等条约，使美国能够仍旧像从前一样控制菲律宾。根据这些条约，美国人在菲律宾，有权像菲律宾人一样开矿，办工厂，设公司，控制菲律宾的对外贸易和重要经济部门。菲律宾的民族资本受到排挤和打击，使得工人大批失业。菲律宾人民的生活非常痛苦。
    美国在菲律宾有许多军事基地。在这些基地上，现在驻扎着十万美国军队。美国兵在菲律宾无恶不作，却不受菲律宾法律的制裁。
    美帝国主义对菲律宾的侵略，激起了菲律宾人民的反抗，并且使他们在斗争中觉悟越来越高。菲律宾人民不断掀起反美斗争，反对美国扼杀菲律宾的民族经济，反对美国军事基地，要求废除同美国签订的一切不平等条约。
    不当美帝侵越炮灰
    美帝国主义一直把菲律宾当作它包围中国、侵略越南的一个重要基地。美国运到南越去的军队、军火物资，大部分都经过菲律宾。在南越受伤的美国侵略军，也都送到菲律宾医治。轰炸越南和老挝解放区的美国飞机，有许多是从菲律宾起飞的。现在，美国为了扩大侵略战争，还在拚命扩充军事基地，并且把更多的美国军队派到菲律宾去。
    菲律宾的反动派充当了美国侵略越南的帮凶。今年年初，菲律宾反动派不顾人民的反对，决定送两千名炮灰到南越去，帮助美国侵略。现在这批炮灰已经陆续派往南越。
    去年上半年，菲律宾人民举行了六次大规模的反美示威。今年年初又掀起了一个新的反美风暴，在许多城市举行示威的群众，愤怒地高呼“美国佬滚回去！”“不要派菲律宾人到越南去！”
    毛主席曾经指出，西方资产阶级在东方造成了两类人，“一类是少数人，这就是为帝国主义服务的洋奴；一类是多数人，这就是反抗帝国主义的工人阶级、农民阶级、城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和从这些阶级出身的知识分子，所有这些，都是帝国主义替自己造成的掘墓人，革命就是从这些人发生的。”菲律宾是套在美帝国主义脖子上的又一根绞索，随着菲律宾人民反美斗争的不断发展，这根绞索正在越拉越紧。
