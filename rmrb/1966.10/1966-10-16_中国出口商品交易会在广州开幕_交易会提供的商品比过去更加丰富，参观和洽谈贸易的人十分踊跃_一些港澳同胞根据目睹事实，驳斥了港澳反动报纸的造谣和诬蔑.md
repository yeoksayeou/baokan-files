Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the 1966 Autumn China Export Commodities Fair opened today in Guangzhou.

In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire nation, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has been seizing the revolution and promoting production. As a result, industry and agriculture have achieved even greater development, providing this session of the fair with more abundant export commodities. Among the nearly 30,000 exhibits displayed in the exhibition halls, there are many new varieties of machinery, textiles, light industrial products, chemical products, instruments and meters, handicrafts, agricultural and sideline products, livestock products, and local specialties, with significantly improved quality. Over 100 types of machinery products on display are mostly new products. The new products successfully developed by Chinese textile workers during the Cultural Revolution are particularly impressive. The number of new products in the light industry sector has increased significantly compared to last autumn, and new products account for half of the exhibits in the instruments and meters category. In terms of agricultural and sideline products, China's traditional major exports such as rice and soybeans are available in full varieties. China's handicrafts, which have long enjoyed an international reputation, have taken on a new look, with a significant increase in works that reflect revolutionary struggles and the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Participants in this session of the fair, including foreign businesspeople, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, have been very enthusiastic. Today, more than 2,000 people visited the exhibition halls to view the exhibits and discuss trade. The number of businesspeople coming to discuss trade on the opening day alone is unprecedented in the history of the fair since 1957. Many of them praised China's achievements in socialist construction, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the excellent situation brought about by the people's efforts to seize the revolution and promote production. Some compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau also refuted the slander and lies spread by reactionary newspapers in Hong Kong and Macau, such as "domestic industrial and agricultural production has stopped" and "the fair has been postponed."

In the evening, the fair held an opening banquet to welcome foreign businesspeople, overseas Chinese, and businesspeople from Hong Kong and Macau. After 100 Red Guards recited Chairman Mao's quotations and sang revolutionary songs, the director of the China Export Commodities Fair, Zeng Sheng, delivered a speech. Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Yang Haolu, also spoke at the banquet. He said that following Chairman Mao's directive, "The Chinese people are willing to engage in friendly cooperation with the people of all countries, restore and develop international trade, and benefit the development of production and the prosperity of the economy," we will continue to implement the policy of "equality and mutual benefit, mutual exchange of needs" in foreign trade. According to needs and possibilities, we will actively engage in trade with businesspeople from various continents, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, and President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, attended the banquet and proposed a toast.

After the banquet, an evening of performing arts was held to entertain the guests.

    中国出口商品交易会在广州开幕
    交易会提供的商品比过去更加丰富，参观和洽谈贸易的人十分踊跃  一些港澳同胞根据目睹事实，驳斥了港澳反动报纸的造谣和诬蔑
    据新华社广州十五日电　在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，一九六六年秋季中国出口商品交易会今天在广州开幕。
    在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，由于全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，工农业获得了更大发展，因而为这届交易会提供出口的商品也比过去更加丰富。在陈列厅展出的近三万种展品中，机械、纺织品、轻工业品、化工产品、仪器仪表、工艺品和农副产品、畜产品、土特产品的新品种很多，质量显著提高。展出的一百多台各种机械产品，大部分是新产品。我国纺织工人在文化大革命高潮中试制成功的新产品更是琳琅满目。轻工业方面的新产品比去年秋季增加很多，仪器仪表的新产品也占了这类展品的一半。在农副产品方面，我国历来大宗出口的大米、大豆，品种齐全。一向享有国际声誉的我国手工艺品，出现了崭新的面貌，以革命斗争为题材，反映工农兵形象的作品大大增加。
    参加这一届交易会的各国客商和华侨、港澳同胞十分踊跃。今天有二千多人到陈列馆参观和洽谈贸易。开幕第一天就有这样多的客商前来洽谈贸易，这是一九五七年以来的历届交易会所没有的。他们中有许多人赞扬我国的社会主义建设成就，赞扬无产阶级文化大革命和我国人民抓革命、促生产带来的大好形势。一些港澳同胞，还根据自己在广州看到的事实，驳斥了港澳反动报纸散布的“国内工农业生产停顿了”、“交易会延期举行”等造谣诬蔑。
    晚上，交易会举行开幕酒会招待各国客商和华侨、港澳商人。在一百名红卫兵朗读毛主席语录、高唱革命歌曲以后，中国出口商品交易会主任委员曾生讲了话。对外贸易部副部长杨浩庐在酒会上讲话，他说，我们遵照毛主席“中国人民愿意同世界各国人民实行友好合作，恢复和发展国际间的通商事业，以利发展生产和繁荣经济”的教导，将继续贯彻“平等互利，互通有无”的对外贸易政策，根据需要和可能，同来自各大洲的工商界人士、海外侨胞和港澳同胞，积极进行交易。
    华侨事务委员会主任、中国亚非团结委员会主席、中日友好协会会长廖承志出席了酒会并在会上祝酒。
    酒会结束后，举行文艺晚会招待客人。
