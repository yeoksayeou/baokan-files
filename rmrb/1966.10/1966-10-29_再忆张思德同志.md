Comrade Zhang Thide was from Lihechang, Yilong County, Sichuan Province. He was born in 1915 into a poor peasant family and from a young age suffered under the oppression and exploitation of the evil landlord class. In 1933, he joined the Red Army. From then until his martyrdom in 1944, Comrade Zhang Thide always took it upon himself to liberate the oppressed people of the world and realize the ideal of communism. When the revolution needed him to clear land and farm, he picked up the hoe and exchanged sweat for grain. When the revolution needed him to make charcoal, he worked with his comrades to produce bright and shiny good charcoal to keep his fellow soldiers warm. When the revolution needed him to be a squad leader, he led his entire squad to become a combat collective that could withstand any test. If he was needed as a soldier, he happily served as an ordinary soldier. He truly embodied Chairman Mao's words: "Completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests."

For the Ideal of Communism

I remember our squad had twelve people, most of whom were young men in their late teens. These twelve people came from all over the country—Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Shanxi. They truly came from the "four corners of the country." Comrade Zhang Thide was the oldest, but he was only in his twenties. He led the entire squad with great spirit. He was strict with every task, but he was most strict with ideological work. He was good at raising the class consciousness of the soldiers from the root, so under his leadership, everyone made rapid progress.

Our squad had a new soldier, whose surname was Liu, and he was only sixteen or seventeen years old. When he first came, he was very timid and didn't dare go out alone at night, even needing someone to accompany him to the toilet. When asked why, he always said there were ghosts at night. To address this situation, one time Comrade Zhang Thide spoke at a squad meeting: "When I was young, I also feared ghosts. Later, the Red Army led by Chairman Mao came to our county, and I was overjoyed. I was no longer afraid of anything and ran thirty miles at night to find the Red Army, leading them to our village. At that time, I asked the Red Army if there were ghosts. They told me: there are no ghosts in the world; if there were, they would be the living ghosts of landlords and capitalist exploiters. Chairman Mao led the Red Army northward, specifically to fight the Japanese ghosts. From then on, I saw through it: ghosts and spirits are all tricks used by landlords and those reactionaries to frighten us poor people, making us not dare to rebel and make a revolution."

Comrade Zhang Thide raised his voice: "We are the people's army, fearing nothing! We do not believe in gods, nor do we fear ghosts. We believe in communism!"

Comrade Zhang Thide's words, one by one, one sentence by one sentence, struck our hearts, making our blood boil and feeling an endless strength within us, determined to smash the old world where ghosts and spirits reign. Little Liu suddenly stood up and shouted, "Comrade Leader, you are right! There are no ghosts in the world. This time, I see through the landlords' tricks to deceive people. From now on, no matter how dark the night or how far the road, let me go deliver the message alone. I am not afraid!"

Later, Comrade Zhang Thide thought of every way to cultivate Little Liu's courage. One time, he had to go to Dingbian Salt Lake to deliver a message. Dingbian Salt Lake is about six or seven hundred miles from Yan'an, with high mountains and difficult roads, and few people. Comrade Zhang Thide personally took Little Liu there. Under Comrade Zhang Thide's leadership, Little Liu later became a brave and clever communication soldier.

Comrade Zhang Thide did ideological work very carefully, often discovering soldiers' ideological problems from their daily behavior; once discovered, he would grasp the opportunity to educate and solve the problem immediately.

In 1942, when we were cultivating land in Nanhuwan, there was a new soldier in our squad with the surname Han. He was usually very lively, but one day, we suddenly didn't hear his violin playing. Comrade Zhang Thide asked me:

"Little Han seems unhappy today."

"I don't know why," I said.

He immediately went to talk to Little Han. It turned out that Little Han had received a letter from home the day before. The letter said: the Japanese devils had raided their hometown, burning down all the houses in the village. Little Han was thus homesick. Comrade Zhang Thide comforted him and said:

"Now, not only your family and village have suffered the barbaric burning and killing of the Japanese devils, but many of our squad members' hometowns, many places and people across the country have also suffered the burning, looting, and killing of the Japanese devils. Only by resolutely fighting against Japan and driving away the evil Japanese devils can the people of the whole country have a good life. You should write a letter to your family, urging them to actively participate in the anti-Japanese struggle. We ourselves should turn our hatred into strength, do a good job in production, and support the frontline military and civilians in fighting the Japanese devils."

That night, he also had Little Han read the family letter to the entire squad, using this fact to educate everyone to resolutely fight against Japan.

"Tomorrow, I will definitely dig a few more plots of land." Some soldiers said angrily.

Comrade Zhang Thide said: "Right! Digging a few more plots of land is like killing a few more Japanese devils."

As a result, not only was Little Han's mood stabilized, but the production enthusiasm of the entire squad was also inspired.

Comrade Zhang Thide was also very good at ideological work with soldiers who had made mistakes, always through careful and patient ideological work, awakening their revolutionary consciousness, making them realize their mistakes.

Our squad had a new comrade transferred from the company. As soon as he arrived, he shouted:

"I have cold legs, and I can't deliver messages."

Everyone knew: his illness was at least 80% psychological. He was "ill" for a few days, and some comrades were impatient, saying to Comrade Zhang Thide:

"His illness is incurable even by the best doctor."

But Comrade Zhang Thide did not agree with these opinions. He patiently explained to us: "If doctors can't cure it, then we need to treat it even more! We are all class brothers and should take good care of him and help him." Comrade Zhang Thide made an analogy. He said: "Doing ideological work requires hard work, carefulness, and patience, just like the shoe-making class in the Third Company, Li Yuanhai, who stitches the soles of shoes one stitch at a time, making the shoes sturdy."

Comrade Zhang Thide himself always enthusiastically cared for this new comrade, taking care of him in life, personally making sickbed meals for him, and getting up in the middle of the night to pour him water to drink. This made the comrade feel extremely warm, and his attitude gradually changed.

Then, Comrade Zhang Thide further reasoned with him:

"Communication work is not to be underestimated! Although we hold things weighing less than five taels in our hands, they are heavier than ten thousand jin loads! ... The messages and words we deliver are the Party's instructions, the people's hopes. Think about it, the Party entrusts us with such an important task, how much trust the Party has in us!"

The comrade listened, thought, and a warm current surged in his heart. He told Comrade Zhang Thide his thoughts:

"Comrade Leader, I just felt that being a communication soldier was not as glorious as being a soldier, running errands all day, more tiring than being in the company. Always lazy and scattered, learning nothing."

"The more tiring, the more glorious. Putting hardship first and enjoyment later, that's a good comrade. It seems like our work is scattered, but it's not. The key is that our thoughts should be tense, not scattered. Delivering messages, there are more opportunities to learn. We meet leaders, soldiers, and villagers every day and can learn a lot from them. Our teachers are the most numerous. ..."

Comrade Zhang Thide's words untangled the knots in the comrade's heart, and he promised Comrade Zhang Thide to correct his mistakes and do a good job. Later, he indeed changed in action and became a good communication soldier.

In the midst of busy work and study, Comrade Zhang Thide often chatted and laughed with everyone. But even in these moments of chatting and laughing, he also guided us to raise our consciousness. Once, when everyone was chatting, the topic turned to how to explain the word "revolution." Everyone had different opinions. When asked Comrade Zhang Thide, he said: "Revolution is not fearing sacrifice, daring to dedicate one's life for the people. In fact, from the day we joined the revolution, we have already dedicated our lives to the Party and the people. We make revolution just like everyone said, to overthrow landlords and capitalists, and now it is to overthrow Japanese imperialism. Our ultimate ideal is to establish a communist society."

We were all greatly inspired by his words.

Mutual Care, Mutual Love, Mutual Help

Although Comrade Zhang Thide was our squad leader and an old comrade who had gone through the Long March, he never treated himself specially, always thinking of others, and caring for comrades more than himself.

In the summer of 1940, to thwart the plot of the Ma Buqing bandits to sneak attack Yan'an, our communication squad followed the troops to the front line about fifty miles northeast of Yan'an at Miaodianzi. One evening, the battalion commander ordered Comrade Zhang Thide to immediately send a letter to the War Room of the General Staff in Wangjiaping, Yan'an, and also instructed to do it as quickly as possible. Comrade Zhang Thide thought of his comrades who had just finished a day of combat exercises and were very tired, so he decided to go himself. We saw him enter the cave with his gun, and quickly asked him:

"Comrade Leader, where are you going?"

"Urgent letter. I'm going back to Yan'an tonight and will return early tomorrow morning."

We a few people immediately gathered around, saying:

"Comrade Leader, you are too tired. Let me go."

Comrade Zhang Thide said: "You are all tired, go rest. I am not tired."

But we still insisted on going. Comrade Zhang Thide immediately said seriously: "I order you to rest properly!" After a pause, he said:

"Comrade Leader orders Zhang Thide to immediately set out and deliver this urgent letter to Yan'an. Do you have any objections?"

With this, everyone laughed. Comrade Zhang Thide took the opportunity to slip out of the cave and set off on the road to Yan'an.

The morning bugle call woke everyone up. I climbed out of bed and looked, it was already dawn. I thought, Comrade Leader must have successfully completed the mission. Suddenly, I heard someone outside shouting:

"Comrade Zhang, you are sweeping the courtyard with your gun, are you afraid the broom will run away?"

"I just returned from Yan'an." This was the voice of the Comrade Leader. Ah! The Comrade Leader has returned, and we felt at ease.

I don't know who said: "Then you should go rest quickly, or you will be late for roll call."

"I am carrying the gun to prepare for roll call." When we put on our clothes and walked out of the cave, Comrade Zhang Thide had already carried two buckets of warm water, waiting for everyone to wash their faces!

From 1940 to 1942, the financial and economic situation of the border area was at its most difficult. We even had difficulty eating, and every day we could only eat some sprouted wheat. One evening, I and Comrade Zhang Thide were walking along the Yanhe River. He said to me while walking:

"Look, recently we have been eating sprouted wheat, and food is becoming more and more scarce. This is only a temporary difficulty. In the future, Party members should eat less."

I nodded, and he smiled and said:

"The stomach is like rubber. Eating eight-tenths full is fine."

I said: "Your words are right; but you eat too little. If you continue like this, your body will collapse."

He smiled calmly and replied: "The comrades have just joined the army and are in a period of growth. Let them eat more and build up their bodies to adapt to the needs of the revolution. I eat less, and my heart feels more comfortable."

At the most difficult time, Comrade Zhang Thide first thought of his comrades, not himself. He regarded sacrificing personal interests for the Party, the people, and comrades as the happiest thing. His great communist spirit infected us. Under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the influence of Comrade Zhang Thide, all the comrades in our squad showed a high degree of unity and love in the face of severe difficulties. When eating, if there were a few steamed buns, no one would eat them, and everyone would push them to each other. Finally, there was no choice but for Comrade Zhang Thide to divide them equally into twelve portions. But he still would not eat the portion given to himself, always saving it to give to the comrade with a weaker body.

Comrade Zhang Thide also cared for comrades from other squads and paid attention to unity. Whenever he had free time, he would go to help the kitchen squad with firewood and water, help the stableman with hay and feed the animals, read newspapers to them, and tell stories of the Long March. He saw that the barber Yang Dingzhong (an old Red Army soldier) was very busy alone, so he picked up the broom and swept the scattered hair out of the cave. When dealing with the relationship between squads, Comrade Zhang Thide always educated us: "Put the brother squad in the first place." Once, a brother squad borrowed our targets. Although we also needed them, he happily lent our targets to them and mobilized us to draw a few targets on old newspapers to use.

I remember that after the Eighth Route Army Grand Theater was built, the Yan'an Pingju Theater performed to entertain the builders of the theater. Our squad also participated in the construction, and Comrade Zhang Thide stood out during the construction and was praised. That day, everyone entered the theater and sat in the front seats. But Comrade Zhang Thide sat in the last row. I called him several times to sit in the front, but he never went. Later, he said to me:

"We are Communist Party members, servants of the people. Our work should be at the forefront, but some living enjoyments and entertainment should be left to other comrades first."

I was deeply moved by Comrade Zhang Thide's high revolutionary consciousness and also ashamed that I had not been as strict with myself as Comrade Zhang Thide.

Indeed, always thinking of others is a noble quality that Comrade Zhang Thide always embodied.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Our cadres should care for every soldier. Everyone in the revolutionary ranks should care for, love, and help each other." Comrade Zhang Thide did exactly that.

A Loyal Servant of the People

Comrade Zhang Thide was a loyal and devoted comrade, truly a loyal servant of the people. Even in his daily interactions with the people, he always paid attention to the interests of the people, serving the people wholeheartedly.

In June 1940, Comrade Zhang Thide led us from Hezhuangping north of Yan'an to complete the weeding task and returned to the Yanhe River. He saw an old villager urgently driving a cow cart in the river channel. It turned out that when crossing the river, the wheel of the big cart sank into the mud, and no matter how hard he drove or pulled, it couldn't be pulled out, making the old villager sweat profusely. Comrade Zhang Thide quickly ran over, not even taking off his clothes and shoes, and jumped into the water, using his shoulder to support the wheel of the big cart. We also rushed over, helping the old villager pull and push, quickly getting the cow cart onto the shore. The old villager wiped the sweat from his head and happily said:

"Thanks to you for helping, I was really worried just now. I was really afraid the Yanhe River would rise."

After the old villager drove the cow cart away, Comrade Zhang Thide said to us: "No matter what difficulties the masses encounter, we should step forward and help them when we see them."

Then, he used his personal experience from the Long March to educate us: "At that time, the reactionary troops of the Kuomintang chased us, and some comrades were injured and couldn't walk. The villagers hid them on their own. No matter how the enemy searched, they couldn't find them. This shows the truth of Chairman Mao's teaching: the army loves the people, and the people support the army."

Comrade Zhang Thide always used his exemplary actions to deepen the people's love for their army. In the autumn of 1941, we came to Nanhuwan to cultivate land. One day, the battalion commander called Comrade Zhang Thide and asked him to deliver a letter to the General Political Department in Yan'an. He waded through water and crossed forests, crossing the Rentai Mountain Ridge up and down for more than twenty miles. When he was about to go down the mountain, he saw an old woman carrying a bundle of firewood, struggling to move down the mountain. He quickly sped up and took the bundle of firewood from the old woman. He felt it was too light, so he cut more firewood by the roadside, bundled it up, and walked down the mountain with the old woman.

When they arrived at the old woman's home, the old woman insisted on having him stay for a meal, but Comrade Zhang Thide politely declined.

The old woman said gratefully: "You Eighth Route Army soldiers, each one loves us common people, truly good soldiers educated by Chairman Mao!"

Comrade Zhang Thide replied: "Grandma! We are the people's children, and we should serve the people. I still have a lot to do."

Comrade Zhang Thide did many things for the Party and the people but never considered his own life. He always put the interests of the people first and paid attention to reducing the burden on the people. His clothes were always patched and patched. A set of cotton clothes was already so torn that it couldn't be patched anymore, but he didn't want to change it. His belt was made of several pieces, and his leggings were so old that they were frayed. In the few years I was with him, I never saw him wear a new pair of cloth shoes. He said: "I can make straw shoes. I save one pair of shoes, and the villager can make one less pair of shoes."

Comrade Zhang Thide always showed the noble quality of serving the people wholeheartedly. His high-quality character was the result of seriously following Chairman Mao's teachings. Our great leader Chairman Mao's personal example in this regard also constantly inspired Comrade Zhang Thide. I remember an incident:

Once, Comrade Zhang Thide went to Dingbian Salt Lake to deliver a message. When he returned to Yan'an, it was already late at night. At that time, he hadn't eaten. He quietly entered the cave, and the comrades were sleeping soundly. He saw that some comrades had kicked off their quilts, so he quickly went over and gently covered them up. Then, he scooped a bowl of water and sat down to drink.

Just then, I also returned from delivering a message. When I entered the cave and saw the Comrade Leader had returned, I quickly went over to greet him. But he had already stood up and tightly held my hand, speaking first:

"Where have you been? Are you tired? Have you eaten?"

I said: "Not tired. I went to Sanli Pu to deliver an urgent letter after dinner. Comrade Leader, you are too tired. You haven't eaten yet, have you?"

Comrade Zhang Thide shook his head and softly said: "Tired? Compared to Chairman Mao, our tiredness is nothing. I just came from Zaoyuan and Yangjialing, and I saw the lights flashing in the caves there. Chairman Mao is still working late at night for the liberation of the Chinese people! Originally, I felt tired, but as soon as I saw those lights, my heart became warm, and I don't know where I got so much strength. I thought: with Chairman Mao, the suffering and oppressed Chinese people will definitely be liberated. I thought more and more, and I became more and more spirited, unknowingly walking to the door. ..."

He was so excited that he almost shed tears and continued: "As long as I think of the Party and Chairman Mao, as long as I think of the complete liberation of the people across the country, all tiredness, all hunger, all difficulties, and all dangers are nothing." I listened, and I couldn't control my inner excitement.

These are things that happened more than twenty years ago. But even now, when I recall them, it's as if they just happened. Comrade Zhang Thide's face, always smiling and kind, seems to be right in front of me. His voice full of revolutionary spirit seems to be echoing in my ears.

In these years, every time I think of Comrade Zhang Thide, I can't control my excitement, and sometimes I can't help but shed hot tears. Comrade Zhang Thide's spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people forever inspires me to move forward. Comrade Zhang Thide will forever be our example to learn from.

    再忆张思德同志
    陈耀
    张思德同志是四川省仪陇县六合场人。他于一九一五年出生在一个贫农家庭里，从小就受着万恶的地主阶级的欺压和剥削。一九三三年，他参加了红军。从那时起，直到一九四四年牺牲，张思德同志始终以解放世界被压迫人民、实现共产主义理想为己任。革命需要他开荒种地，他就拿起镢头，用汗水换来粮食。革命需要他烧炭，他就和同志们一起生产出明光光、蓝油油的好木炭，供战友们取暖。革命需要他当班长，他就把全班带领成经得起考验的战斗集体。再要他当战士，他就愉快地当好普通一兵。他真正做到了毛主席所说的：完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。
    为了共产主义的理想
    记得我们班共有十二个人，多半是十七、八岁的小青年。这十二个人来自全国各地，有湖南、江西、贵州、四川的，也有甘肃、陕西、河北和山西等地的，真是“来自五湖四海”。张思德同志年龄最大，也只有二十几岁，他把全班战士带领得精神焕发。他对什么工作都抓得很紧，但是抓得最紧的是思想工作。他善于从根本上提高战士的阶级觉悟，所以，在他的领导下，大家的进步都很快。
    我们班有个新战士，记得姓刘，年纪才十六、七岁，刚来时胆子很小，夜间一个人不敢出去，连大小便也要找个人作伴儿。问他为什么，他总是说夜间有鬼。针对这种情况，有一次张思德同志就在班务会上讲：“我小时候，也怕鬼。后来，毛主席领导的红军到了我们县境，我高兴极了，什么也不怕了，深夜跑到三十里外去找红军，把红军领到我们村里去了。那时，我问过红军，有没有鬼。他们告诉我：天下根本没有鬼；要有，那就是活着的、剥削咱们的鬼地主、鬼资本家。毛主席率领红军北上，就是专门打日本鬼的。从那以后，我看穿了：鬼神，全是地主和那些反动家伙们用来吓唬咱们穷人的，让咱们不敢翻身闹革命。”
    张思德同志提高了嗓音：“咱们是人民的军队，什么也不怕！咱们一不信神，二不怕鬼，咱们信共产主义！”
    张思德同志的话，一字字，一句句，紧紧扣着我们的心，说得我们热血直往上涌，感到身上有无穷的力量，定能把那鬼神横行的旧世界砸烂。小刘霍地站起来，高声说：“班长，你说得对！天下根本没有鬼。这回，我看透了地主老财们那套骗人的鬼把戏。以后送信，不论天多黑，路多远，就叫我一个人去送吧。我不怕！”
    以后，张思德同志又想尽办法，培养小刘的胆量。一次，要往定边盐池去送信。定边盐池离延安有六七百里，沿途尽是高山，道路难走，人烟稀少。张思德同志亲自带着小刘去了。在张思德同志的带领下，小刘后来成了一个又勇敢又机灵的通信战士。
    张思德同志做思想工作做得很细，往往从战士的日常表现中就能发现战士思想上的问题；发现了就抓紧教育，及时解决。
    一九四二年我们在南泥湾开荒生产的时候，班里有个姓韩的新战士，平时很活泼，没事的时候，就拉起他那把用木瓜树制做的土胡琴来。可是，一天，忽然听不到他的琴声了。张思德同志问我：
    “小韩今天怎么不高兴了？”
    我说：“不知道为啥。”
    他立刻去找小韩谈心。原来小韩昨天收到了家信。信里说：日本鬼子扫荡了他们家乡，烧光了全村的房屋。小韩因而一时想起家来。张思德同志安慰了他，并且对他说：
      “现在不仅是你们一家、一个村子遭到了日本鬼子的野蛮烧杀，咱们全班很多同志的家乡，全国很多地方、很多老百姓都遭到了日本鬼子的烧杀抢掠。只有坚决抗日，赶走万恶的日本鬼子，全国人民才能过好日子。你应当给家里写信，动员家里人积极参加抗日，咱们自己更应该把仇恨化为力量，搞好生产，做好工作，支援前方军民打日本鬼子。”
    晚上，他又让小韩把家信读给全班战士听，用这个事实来教育大家坚决抗日。
    “明天上山，我一定多挖它几分地。”有的战士愤愤地说。
    张思德同志说：“对！多挖几分地，就等于多消灭几个日本鬼子。”
    结果，不但稳定了小韩的情绪，而且激励了全班战士的生产热情。
    张思德同志对于犯有过错的战士，也总是通过细致耐心的思想工作，启发他的革命自觉性，使他醒悟过来。
    我们班从连里调来一个新同志。一到班里来，就嚷嚷：
    “我有寒腿病，可送不了信。”
    大家心里都清楚：他的病，起码有八成是思想病。他这样“病”了几天，有的同志就不耐烦了，对张思德同志说：
    “他那个病，再好的医生也治不了。”
    但是张思德同志很不同意这些意见。他耐心地向我们解释说：“医生治不了，就更需要咱们大家治啊！咱们都是阶级兄弟，应当好好关心他、帮助他。”张思德同志打了个比喻。他说：“做思想工作要下苦功夫，要细致耐心，就像三连做鞋班李元海同志纳鞋底一样，要一针一针、细细地纳，做出的鞋子才结实。”
    张思德同志自己始终热情地关怀这个新同志，在生活上照顾他，亲自给他做病号饭，半夜起来给他倒水喝。使那位同志感到了极大的温暖，态度渐渐转变了。
    于是，张思德同志进一步给他讲道理：
    “通信工作可不能小看哪！别看咱们手上拿的是不到五钱重的东西，可它要比千斤担万斤担还重啊！……咱们送的信、传的话，都是党的指示，都是人民的希望。你想想看，党把这么重要的任务交给咱们，对咱们有多大的信任啊！”
    那位同志听着、想着，一股暖流在心里升腾起来。他向张思德同志说出了心里话：
    “班长，我就觉得当通信员没有当战士光荣，整天跑腿儿，比在连里还累。成天散散漫漫的，学不到什么东西。”
    “越累才越光荣。吃苦在前，享受在后，这才是好同志。看起来，咱们的工作好像是散漫，其实并不是那样。问题是咱们的思想要紧张，不要散漫。送信，学习的机会更多。咱们天天接触首长、战士和老乡，可以向他们学到不少东西。咱们的老师最多。……”
    张思德同志的话，使那位同志解开了疙瘩，他向张思德同志保证，坚决改正错误，做好工作。后来，他果然在行动上有了转变，成了一个很好的通信战士。
    在紧张的工作和学习之余，张思德同志经常和大家一起说说笑笑。但就在这说说笑笑的时候，他也注意引导我们提高觉悟。有一次大伙儿聊天，扯到了“革命”这两个字怎样解释。各有各的看法。问到张思德同志，他说：“革命，就是不怕牺牲，敢为人民献出自己的生命。实际上咱们从参加革命那天起，就已经把自己的生命交给党和人民了。咱们闹革命就是像大家所说的是为了推翻地主、资本家，现在就是为了打倒日本帝国主义。咱们的最终理想是建立共产主义社会。”
    我们听了，都受到很大启发。
    互相关心、互相爱护、互相帮助
    张思德同志虽然是我们的班长，是经过长征的老同志，但是，他从不特殊，处处想到别人，关心同志比关心自己为重。
    一九四○年初夏，为了粉碎马步芳匪军偷袭延安的阴谋，我们通信班随部队开到延安东北约五十里的姚店子前线。一天傍晚，营首长命令张思德同志立即派人把一封急信送到延安王家坪总参谋部作战室，并且叮嘱越快越好。张思德同志想到战友们刚刚结束了一天的战斗演习，很累，便决定自己去送。我们见他一走进窑洞就拿枪，忙问他：
    “班长，你到哪里去？”
    “有急件。今晚回一趟延安，明天一早赶回来。”
    我们几个人立刻围过去，纷纷说：
    “班长，你太累了，我去吧。”
    张思德同志说：“你们都累了，快休息吧。我不累。”
    但我们仍然争着要去。张思德同志马上严肃地说：“我命令你们老老实实休息！”停了停，他又说：
    “班长命令张思德立刻出发，把这封急件送回延安。你们有没有意见？”
    这么一说，大家乐开了。张思德同志趁机一溜烟跑出了窑洞，踏上了通往延安的大道。
    起床的号音把人们叫醒。我爬起来，一看，天已经麻麻亮了。心想，班长大概顺利完成任务了吧。忽然，听见外面有人在喊：
    “张班长，你打扫院子还背着枪，是不是怕扫帚跑掉啊？”
    “我从延安刚回来。”这是班长的声音。啊！班长回来了，我们心里踏实了。
    不知是谁又说：“那你还不赶快休息去，一会儿就要出操了。”
    “我背着枪，就是准备出操的。”当我们穿好衣服，走出窑洞时，张思德同志早已挑了两桶温水，等候大家洗脸呢！
    一九四○年到一九四二年，边区的财政经济处在最困难的时期。我们连吃粮都很困难，每天只能吃些生了芽的麦子。有天傍晚，我和张思德同志在延河岸边散步。他一边走，一边对我说：
    “你看，最近吃开了生芽的麦子，粮食越来越不够吃了。这只是暂时的困难，今后咱们党员要少吃点。”
    我点点头，他又笑着说：
    “肚子这玩艺儿，是橡皮的。吃个八成饱也就成了。”
    我接过来说：“你说的道理很对；不过你吃得太少了。这样下去，你的身体会搞垮的啊！”
    他坦然地笑了笑，回答说：“同志们参军不久，正是成长的时候。让他们多吃点，把身体搞好，好适应革命的需要。我少吃一点，心里反而舒坦。”
    在最困难的时候，张思德同志首先想到的不是自己，而是同志。他把能够为党、为人民、为同志而牺牲个人的利益，当作最愉快的事。他的这种伟大的共产主义精神感染了我们。在党和毛主席的教育下，在张思德同志的影响下，我们全班同志在严重的困难时期，都表现了高度的团结友爱精神。吃饭时，有几个馒头，谁也不肯吃，都互相推让。最后没办法，张思德同志只好平均分成十二份。但是，他还是不肯把分给自己的一份吃掉，总是留着，等最后送给身体弱的同志。
    张思德同志对于其他班的同志同样非常爱护，注意团结。一有空，他就去帮助炊事班烧火担水，帮助饲养员铡草喂牲口，给他们读报，讲长征故事。他看到理发员杨定忠同志（老红军战士）一个人很忙，就拿起扫帚把地上的乱头发扫出去。在处理班与班的关系时，张思德同志总是教育我们：要把兄弟班放在第一位。有一次，兄弟班向我们借靶子。本来我们也正要用，但是他愉快地把我们的靶子借给了他们，而动员我们用旧报纸画几个靶子用。
    记得八路军大礼堂建成以后，延安平剧院演戏慰问礼堂的建设者。我们班也参加了建设，在建设中张思德同志表现得很突出，曾受到表扬。这天，大家走进礼堂，都往前面的位子上坐。可是张思德同志却坐到最后一排。我几次叫他坐到前面去，他始终没去。事后，他对我说：
    “咱们是共产党员，是人民的勤务员，工作应当跑在前边，可是一些生活享受和娱乐的事情，应当先让给别的同志。”
    我听了，深深为张思德同志那种高度的革命自觉性所感动，也深深为自己没有像张思德同志那样严格要求自己而惭愧。
    的确，处处想到别人，这是张思德同志身上时刻闪耀着的一种高贵品质。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”张思德同志正是这样做的。
    忠实的人民勤务员
    张思德同志是个忠心耿耿的好同志，他不愧是一个忠实的人民勤务员。就是在日常和人民群众接触中，他也随时随地注意关心人民群众的利益，全心全意为人民服务。
    一九四○年六月，张思德同志带着我们从延安北边的河庄坪完成锄草任务回来，走到延河边，看见一位老乡在河道里着急地吆喝着赶一辆牛车。原来过河时大车的轱辘陷进泥水里，怎么赶、怎么拉也出不来，急得老乡满头大汗。张思德同志急忙跑过去，连衣服和鞋子也没脱，就跳进水里，用肩膀扛着大车的轱辘。我们也随着赶到，帮助老乡连拉带推，很快就把牛车赶上了岸。老乡擦擦头上的汗，高兴地说：
    “多亏你们来帮忙，刚才可把人急死了。我真怕延河涨水啊！”
    老乡赶走牛车以后，张思德同志对我们说：“不论群众遇到什么困难，咱们看见了都要挺身而出，帮助他们。”
    接着，他又用长征中亲身经历的事情教育我们说：“那时，国民党反动军队追赶我们，有些同志负了伤，来不及走。老乡们就自动把他们藏起来。敌人怎么搜也搜不到。这就说明了毛主席教导的真理：军爱民，民就拥军。”
    张思德同志时时以自己的模范行动，去加深人民群众对自己军队的爱戴。一九四一年深秋，我们来到了南泥湾开荒生产。一天，营首长把张思德同志叫了去，叫他送一封信到延安总政治部去。他趟水穿林，翻过了上下二十多里的仁台山梁，下山就是仁台村。张思德同志刚要下山，发现一位老大娘背着一捆干柴，正艰难地往山下移动。他连忙加快脚步，赶上前去，抢着背过大娘的那捆干柴。他觉得太轻了，便又在道旁砍了些干柴，捆在一起，跟着老大娘走下山去。
    到了老大娘的家，老大娘非要留他吃饭不可，张思德同志婉言谢绝了。
    大娘感激地说：“你们八路军，个个都爱我们老百姓，可真是毛主席教育出来的好战士啊！”
    张思德同志回答说：“大娘！我们是人民的子弟兵，应该为人民服务。我还做得很不够。”
    张思德同志为党为人民做了许许多多工作，却从不考虑个人的生活。他以人民群众的利益为重，时刻注意减轻人民群众的负担。他的衣服，总是补钉摞补钉。一套棉衣已经破烂得没法再补了，他也不肯换新的。他的皮带是几截儿接成的，绑腿破旧得发了毛。在我同他相处的几年中，没见他领过布鞋。他说：“我会打草鞋。我少要一双鞋，老乡就可以少做一双鞋。”
    张思德同志处处表现了全心全意为人民服务的高尚品质。他这种高尚的品质，是因为他认真听从毛主席的教导的结果。我们的伟大领袖毛主席在这方面的身体力行，更是经常熏陶着张思德同志。记得有这样一件事：
    有一次，张思德同志到定边盐池送信。赶回延安，已经是深夜。那时他还没有吃饭。他轻轻地走进窑洞，同志们睡得正香。发现有些同志把被子踹开了，他连忙走过去，轻轻地给他们盖好。随后，他舀了一碗水，坐下喝着。
    刚巧，这时我也送信回来。走进窑洞，一看班长回来了，连忙过去想问候他。但他却已经站起来，紧紧地握住我的手，先开口了：
    “你到哪儿去了？累了吧，吃饭没有？”
    我说：“不累。我是吃过晚饭出去的，到三十里铺送了份急件。班长，你太累了。你还没吃饭吧？”
    张思德同志摇摇头，轻声地说：“累什么，比起毛主席来，咱们这点累算不了什么。我刚才从枣园、杨家岭那边过来，看到那边窑洞里灯光闪闪。毛主席深夜还在为中国人民的解放事业操心呢！本来，我是感到累，可一看到那些灯光，心里就热呼呼的，不知哪来的那么大劲儿。我想到：有了毛主席，受苦受难的中国人民一定能得到彻底解放。我越想越有精神，不知不觉就走到了门口。……”
    他激动得几乎流出了眼泪，又接着说：“一想起党和毛主席，一想起全国人民的彻底解放，什么累，什么饿，全都跑光了；什么困难，什么危险全都不在话下。”我听着，也抑制不住内心的激动。
    这些，都是二十多年前的事了。可是，直到现在回忆起来，还是像刚刚发生的一样。张思德同志那副总是微笑的、亲切的面容，仿佛就在眼前。他的充满革命精神的响亮声音，好像就在耳边萦回。
    这些年来，每当想起张思德同志的时候，我都控制不住激动的心情，有时情不自禁地滚下热泪。张思德同志那种完全地、彻底地为人民服务的革命精神永远鼓舞着我前进。张思德同志永远是我们学习的榜样！（原载《解放军报》）
