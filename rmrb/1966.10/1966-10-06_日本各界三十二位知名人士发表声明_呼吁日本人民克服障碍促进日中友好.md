	Japanese various circles 32 prominent figures issued a statement
	Urging the Japanese people to overcome obstacles and promote Sino-Japanese friendship
	According to a report from our newspaper, on the afternoon of October 5, the chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Miyazaki Seiichi, read out the statement "At a time of internal and external crises, once again appealing to the people to promote Sino-Japanese friendship" issued by 32 prominent figures from various circles in Japan on September 26, at a rally of people from all walks of life in the capital. The full text is as follows:

		(1) The promotion of friendship and exchange between Japan and China, and the strengthening of solidarity between the two peoples, is a matter of great importance that cannot be ignored for a single day in post-war Japan, for all those who seriously consider problems and truly love their country. It reflects the aspirations of the vast majority of the people who have sworn in their hearts never to repeat the path of Japanese militarism that led from aggression to destruction.

		Therefore, the national movement to achieve Sino-Japanese friendship and restore diplomatic relations has overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieved brilliant development. In February of the previous year, representatives from various circles who share the same ideals issued the "Appeal for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China," which received the support of the broad masses of the people. Now, this movement has become the sole bastion of all democratic and patriotic forces and their movements in our country.

		The Chinese people, who have won the victory of the liberation struggle, have made tremendous efforts, regardless of the crimes committed by Japanese militarism, for the sake of Sino-Japanese friendship and exchange on a new basis of equality and mutual benefit, and for the solidarity of the two peoples. This has responded to the aspirations of the vast majority of the Japanese people. The efforts made by the peoples of the two countries for friendship and solidarity have played an extremely great role in the peace of Asia and in the struggle for liberation of all oppressed peoples in Asia.

		(2) Today, the situation in Asia is extremely tense. Under the brave and selfless struggle of the people of North and South Vietnam, American imperialism has been falling into a more and more painful situation day by day. However, the more painful its situation becomes, the more it chooses the path of expanding the war. China, with its vast territory and 700 million people, stands firmly on the side of the Vietnamese people, declaring its determination to take all necessary measures deemed necessary by the two peoples in the struggle against American imperialism, not giving an inch.

		The development of the situation has made the movement to achieve Sino-Japanese friendship and exchange and the solidarity of the two peoples face a more urgent and important moment than ever before. If the broad masses of the Japanese people defend and expand the bastion of Sino-Japanese friendship, it will undoubtedly not only be in the interests of the two peoples but will also be a great support to the Vietnamese people and an important contribution to the peace and liberation of Asia.

		(3) The environment surrounding the Sino-Japanese friendship movement will be more severe in the future than it has been in the past. Forces that specialize in following the American government will certainly intensify their obstruction and suppression of friendship and exchange. The conspiracy of "two Chinas," disguised in various ways, will also be carried out more vigorously.

		At the same time, in order to further advance the movement for Sino-Japanese friendship and exchange, it is necessary to overcome the obstacles that have arisen within the movement in Japan. Recently, there has also been a tendency within our movement to create various pretexts to obstruct the development of friendship and exchange. Such tendencies are nothing but making the U.S.-Japanese reactionary forces happy and lending a helping hand to their anti-China policy.

		The Sino-Japanese friendship movement has accumulated enough strength to overcome any pressure and has accumulated experience not to be deceived by any conspiracy. This national movement, regardless of who obstructs it, will continue to expand, deepen, and develop. This is an irresistible historical trend.

		We, the signatories of this statement, appeal to the broad masses of the people and all patriotic people from all walks of life to advance the great cause of Sino-Japanese friendship with confidence before the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

		Iwai Akio, Ito Takeo, Ueno Shinkichi, Ota Kuni, Otani Yoshitoshi, Ouchi Hyoe, Kenmoto Tomitaro, Kamei Shoichiro, Kawasaki Natsu, Kaneko Jiro, Kimura Ibuei, Kuroda Toshio, Kubo Hakujitsu, Kobayashi Yoshio, Kobayashi Yuichi, Sasakura Kozo, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, Shiraishi Bon, Suetake Hiroshi, Sugimura Shunko, Chida Koreyuki, Takano Minoru, Tanaka Sumiko, Tsuchi Shigemasa, Nakajima Kenzo, Hara Takeshi, Horii Toshikatsu, Fukao Sumako, Makino Takeshi, Matsuoka Yoko, Miyazaki Seiichi, Mishima Kazuichi

### 日本各界三十二位知名人士发表声明  呼吁日本人民克服障碍促进日中友好

    日本各界三十二位知名人士发表声明
    呼吁日本人民克服障碍促进日中友好
    本报讯　日中友协理事长宫崎世民五日下午在首都各界群众集会上，宣读日本各界三十二位知名人士九月二十六日发表的《在内外危机的时候，再次呼吁国民促进日中友好》的声明，全文如下：
    （一）推进日本和中国的友好—交流，加强两国人民的团结，这在战后的日本，对于一切认真考虑问题、真正爱国的人来说，是一天也不容忽视的重大事情。它反映了在心里宣誓要决不重走过去日本军国主义走过的从侵略走向毁灭的道路的绝大多数国民的愿望。
    因此，争取日中友好和恢复邦交的国民运动，才克服了所有的困难和障碍，得到了辉煌的发展。前年二月，代表各界志同道合的人士发表了《恢复日中邦交号召书》，得到了广大国民的支持。现在，这个运动已经成为我国一切民主的爱国的力量及其运动的唯一的堡垒。
    取得了解放斗争的胜利的中国人民，不顾日本军国主义犯下的罪行，为了新的平等互惠的基础上的日中友好—交流和两国人民的团结，一贯作出了巨大的努力，回答了绝大多数日本国民的愿望。日中两国人民为友好团结所作的努力，对于亚洲和平以及亚洲一切被压迫民族的解放斗争，起了极其巨大的作用。
    （二）今天，亚洲形势极为紧张。美帝国主义在南北越南人民英勇的奋不顾身的斗争下，已经一天一天陷入痛苦的境地。但是，它越是处境痛苦，就越是继续一个劲地选择扩大战争的道路。有辽阔国土和七亿人民的中国，坚决站在越南人民的一边，表示决心要采取两国人民认为必要的一切手段，在同美帝国主义针锋相对的斗争中寸步不让。
    形势的这种发展，使我们争取日中友好—交流和两国人民团结的运动也面临了比过去更紧急而重要的时刻。如果广大的日本人民保卫和扩大日中友好的堡垒，那么，肯定不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且会成为对越南人民的巨大支援，成为对亚洲的和平与解放的重要贡献。
    （三）围绕着日中友好运动的环境，今后将比过去更加严峻。专门以追随美国政府为事业的势力，肯定会加紧阻挠和压迫友好—交流。处心积虑用各种伪装打扮起来的“两个中国”阴谋也将变本加厉地推行。
    与此同时，目前，为了进一步推进日中友好—交流的运动，就必须克服在日本的运动内部产生的障碍。在我们的运动内部，最近也产生了制造种种借口，企图极力阻挠友好—交流发展的倾向。这样的倾向不外是使美日反动势力高兴，给他们的反华政策助一臂之力。
    日中友好运动已经具备了足以战胜任何压力的力量，积累了不受任何阴谋欺骗的经验。这个国民运动，不管阻挡它的人是谁，都将越来越扩大、加深和发展。这是任何人也阻挡不了的强大的历史潮流。
    我们，在本声明上签字的人，在中国国庆十七周年以前，呼吁广大国民、各阶层一切爱国的人士满怀信心地把日中友好的伟大事业进一步推向前进。
