Editor's Note: On this joyous National Day, we are thrilled to introduce to our readers a series of advanced experiences and insights from workers, peasants, and soldiers who are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. These comrades are fighting on all fronts of our motherland, with diverse jobs, but they share one common trait: they have an immense class sentiment for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. They read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their minds and guide their actions. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, the smartest, and the most selfless, possessing the greatest fighting spirit. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, they are invincible. Whether they are fighting, drilling for oil, planting trees, or slaughtering pigs, no matter what difficulties they encounter or what problems arise, they can find inspiration and solutions in Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our victories.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, with a population of 700 million. We need a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought. By instilling Chairman Mao's thoughts into the workers and peasants, we can change the spiritual face of the laboring people and transform spiritual strength into immense material force. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have repeatedly proven this truth through their personal experiences.

Currently, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, the nationwide movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has entered a new stage and reached a new peak. What we publish here is only a few ripples and droplets from this high tide, but even from these small details, the brilliant light and boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought are vividly reflected, as well as the new spiritual face of the revolutionary people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's words are the truth, every word and sentence is full of infinite power. In battle,
Chairman Mao's quotations are the call to arms.

On the East China Sea, a heroic gunboat—“Sea Tiger Boat”—is sailing. On every combat position of this boat, sailors have carefully made quotation boards of Chairman Mao, and in the engine room, sailors have personally drawn quotation slogans. The sailors say: Chairman Mao's words are unshakable truths, every word and sentence is the root of revolution, the source of strength, the guide to action, and the weapon of battle. In stormy seas, learning them makes difficulties seem like nothing; in the midst of gunfire, learning them makes any enemy seem insignificant.

Last November 14th, at dawn, the sea east of Chongwu was filled with the roar of cannons. The heroic People's Navy fleet, punishing the American-made Kuomintang pirate ships “Yongchang” and “Yongtai,” had begun their battle. The “Sea Tiger Boat” was like a sharp dagger, directly charging at the enemy ships. The boat was flying through the waves, shaking like a cradle. Some comrades vomited. At that moment, from the gun positions, from the engine room, pieces of paper with Chairman Mao's quotations were passed around the boat: “Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory.” “This army has a spirit of pressing forward unyieldingly. It will vanquish all enemies and will never be subdued by any enemy.”

One quotation is a call to arms. Every word of Chairman Mao gives the brave fighting sailors boundless strength.

The boat, under enemy fire, fought more fiercely, getting closer and closer to the enemy ships. In the engine room, the engine mechanic Lin Lizhao, in a temperature of over 40 degrees, was choked by the oil smoke, making it hard for him to open his eyes, and he was vomiting continuously. The engine room leader, Communist Party member Wang Muchang, saw this and wrote on the wall: “Develop the spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, daring to endure hardships, and daring to fight continuously (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest).” Seeing this quotation from Chairman Mao, Lin Lizhao felt an infinite surge of strength. This new soldier, participating in a sea battle for the first time, stood at his combat position for over ten hours, completed his battle mission excellently, and was awarded a meritorious deed.

    编者按：在举国欢腾的国庆节日，我们怀着无比兴奋的心情，向读者介绍一批工农兵同志活学活用毛主席著作的先进事迹和心得体会。这些同志战斗在祖国的四面八方，工作岗位千差万别，但是，有一点却是共同的：他们对伟大的领袖毛主席，对伟大的毛泽东思想，具有无限深厚的阶级感情。他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，指导自己的行动。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，最聪明，最无私，是最大的战斗力，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中，无往而不胜。他们不论是打仗，还是采油、种树、杀猪，不论碰到什么困难，发生什么问题，都可以从毛主席著作中得到启示，找到解决问题的途径。毛泽东思想是我们取得一切胜利的源泉。
    林彪同志指出：我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。广大工农兵以自己的切身经验，反复地证明了这一真理。
    目前，随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，已经进入一个新的阶段，出现一个新的高潮。这里发表的，虽然只是学习毛主席著作高潮中的几个浪花，几滴水珠，但是，从这些点滴的材料里，已经鲜明地反映出毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉和无限威力，反映出在毛泽东思想哺育下，革命人民的崭新的精神面貌。
    毛主席的话，字字句句都是真理，字字句句都有无穷的力量。在战斗中，
    毛主席语录就是动员令
    在祖国东海上，驰骋着一艘英雄的炮艇——“海上猛虎艇”。这艘艇的每个战位上，都有水兵们精心制作的毛主席语录板，机舱里有水兵们亲手绘制的语录标语。水兵们说：毛主席说的话，都是颠扑不破的真理，字字句句都是革命的根本，力量的源泉，行动的指南，战斗的武器。在狂风恶浪中学了它，艰苦困难踩脚下；在枪林弹雨中学了它，任何敌人都不怕。
    去年十一月十四日凌晨，崇武以东的海面上，炮声隆隆。英雄的人民海军舰艇部队，痛惩美制蒋帮海盗舰只“永昌号”、“永泰号”的战斗打响了。“海上猛虎艇”像一把锋利的尖刀，直插敌舰。战艇在巨浪中飞驰，艇身像只摇篮，剧烈地摇晃着。有的同志呕吐了。这时，从炮位，从机舱，一张张写着毛主席语录的纸条，在艇上传开了：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”
    一条语录，就是一道动员令。毛主席的每一句话，都给英勇战斗的水兵们增添了无限的力量。
    战艇冒着敌人的炮火，越打越勇猛，越打距离敌舰越近。战斗在机舱里的轮机兵林立潮，在四十多度的高温下，油烟熏得他眼难睁，不断呕吐。轮机班长、共产党员王木昌看见了，就在舱壁上写了：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”林立潮看着这段毛主席语录，浑身增添了无穷的力量。这个第一次参加海战的新战士，坚守战位十几个小时，出色地完成了战斗任务，荣立了战功。
