A type of electrostatic spray painting machine that can fundamentally improve the working conditions of manual spray painting has been successfully developed in Beijing at the Taoran Ting Electrostatic Equipment Factory.

Using this electrostatic spray painting machine not only saves 30 to 50 percent of paint compared to general manual spray painting, but also ensures that the paint film is evenly thick and less prone to peeling. Additionally, the phenomenon of paint mist permeating the air, which occurs during manual spray painting, is significantly reduced.

    北京试制成功静电喷漆机
    一种能从根本上改善手工喷漆劳动条件的静电喷漆机，在北京陶然亭静电设备厂试制成功。
    使用这种静电喷漆机不仅比一般手工喷漆节约油漆百分之三十到百分之五十，而且漆膜厚薄均匀，不易脱落。同时，手工喷漆时那种漆雾弥漫的现象也显著减少。
