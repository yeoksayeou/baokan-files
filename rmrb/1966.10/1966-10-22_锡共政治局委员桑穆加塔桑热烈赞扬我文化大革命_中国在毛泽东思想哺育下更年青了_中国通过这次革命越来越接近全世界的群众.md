	Sri Lankan Communist Party Central Committee Politburo Member and Secretariat Member Sanmugathasan has warmly praised our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in an article in the *Labour News*. He enthusiastically lauded Chairman Mao Zedong's special contributions to the theoretical treasury of Marxism-Leninism.

	He said: "One of Mao Zedong's special contributions to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism is that he summarized the experiences of the revolutions in China and other countries and drew the conclusion that throughout the entire historical period of socialism, there exist classes and class struggle, there exists the danger of capitalist restoration, and there exists the danger of the loss and overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

	Sanmugathasan said that Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China were aware of this threat and had taken measures to deal with it. "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China was launched under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and is being carried out under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong."

	Sanmugathasan's article, titled "News from Beijing," was written after he returned to Sri Lanka from Beijing, where he participated in the celebrations of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was published in the October 12 issue of the *Labour News*.

	Sanmugathasan spoke about his impressions of participating in the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing: "On that unforgettable day, when I stood on Tiananmen Gate and watched the parade of a million people accepting the inspection of Chairman Mao Zedong, I was convinced that the leadership of the world revolutionary movement is in reliable hands." This was a massive demonstration of the people, the largest in the world.

	Sanmugathasan said that all of China has become younger under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. "The red light in the Kremlin has gone out. The red lanterns on Tiananmen Square shine brighter and brighter, lighting the way for all the oppressed peoples of the world."

	Sanmugathasan enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards in China. He said: "What interests me most in this great revolutionary upsurge taking place in China today is that the Chinese people clearly realize and know that it is not enough just to achieve success in the Chinese revolution, to raise their own living standards and compete with the West. They realize that they must also achieve success in the world revolution, and they must clearly remember the fate of the unliberated peoples and help them."

	He refuted the imperialist and modern revisionist propaganda that China has isolated itself through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He pointed out: "Through this great revolutionary upsurge, China is becoming closer and closer to the masses of the world. It is these masses who make up more than ninety percent of the world's population."

    锡共政治局委员桑穆加塔桑热烈赞扬我文化大革命
    中国在毛泽东思想哺育下更年青了
    中国通过这次革命越来越接近全世界的群众
    新华社科伦坡十九日电　锡兰共产党中央委员会政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑在《劳工报》上发表一篇介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的文章，热情赞扬毛泽东主席对马克思列宁主义的理论宝库作出了特殊的贡献。
    他说：“毛泽东对马克思列宁主义宝库所作的特殊贡献之一，是他总结了中国和其他国家革命的经验并且作出他的结论：在整个社会主义的历史时期都存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险，存在着无产阶级专政丧失和被颠覆的危险。”
    桑穆加塔桑说，毛泽东主席和中国共产党意识到这个威胁，并且采取了措施来对付它。“中国的无产阶级文化革命一开始就是由中国共产党中央委员会领导并且是在毛泽东主席的亲自指导下进行的。”
    桑穆加塔桑的这篇标题为《来自北京的消息》的文章，是他在到北京参加了庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年的庆祝活动回到锡兰以后写的，发表在十月十二日出版的《劳工报》上。
    桑穆加塔桑谈到他在北京参加庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年的庆祝大会的观感时说：“在那个难忘的日子里，当我站在天安门城楼上观看接受毛泽东主席检阅的百万人游行的时候，我确信世界革命运动的领导权掌握在可靠的人手里。”这是一次大规模的群众示威，是世界上最大的一次示威。
    桑穆加塔桑说，全中国在毛泽东思想的哺育下变得年青了。“克里姆林宫的红灯已经熄灭。天安门广场上的红灯笼照得愈来愈红，愈来愈亮，它是世界上一切被压迫人民的指路明灯。”
    桑穆加塔桑热情地赞扬中国文化大革命和红卫兵。他说：“今天正在中国掀起的这场伟大的革命高潮中最使我感兴趣的是：中国群众清楚地意识到并知道，光是中国革命获得成功，只提高他们自己的生活水平和同西方竞赛，这是不够的。他们认识到，还必须使世界革命成功，他们必须清楚地记住未获得解放的人民的命运并帮助他们。”
    他驳斥了帝国主义和现代修正主义散布的所谓中国通过无产阶级文化大革命把自己孤立起来的谰言。他指出：“通过这次革命大高涨，中国越来越接近全世界的群众。正是这些群众占全世界人口百分之九十以上。”
