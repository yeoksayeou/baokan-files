After the formation of the Red Guards, the revolution surged forward like a torrent, sweeping away everything that opposed it. In a matter of days and weeks, the Red Guards accomplished what could not have been done in decades. They played a vanguard role in the Cultural Revolution.

Under the leadership of the contemporary Lenin—Mao Zedong, the young Red Guards of China are cleansing the past's filth and eliminating all the remnants of feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism, paving the way for China's great leap forward. Their experiences and victories will contribute to the international communist movement of Marxism-Leninism.

The struggle of the Red Guards is the best barrier against the infiltration and corruption of bourgeois ideology and the prevention of revisionism. This is the succession of the revolution, which will not allow the revolution to stagnate, become conservative, or reverse course.

The actions of the Red Guards are revolutionary actions of destruction and renewal, which will be recorded in the annals of class struggle led by the proletariat.

The Red Guards are Chairman Mao Zedong's little red soldiers, the successors of revolutionary forebears. We have witnessed the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. They have smashed the old and established the new, protected cultural relics and national property, and achieved great success. All of this powerfully refutes the vile lies spread by bourgeois and revisionist newspapers about the Red Guards.

		Japan		Seisuke Shimizu

The Red Guards are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the purest, most intelligent, most awakened, most courageous, and most revolutionary youth. They are determined to temper themselves in the fiery crucible of the Cultural Revolution, becoming reliable successors to the revolutionary cause of the nation, fearless of hardship and death, and dedicated to the revolution and the people.

		Japan		Miyazaki Seimin

The Chinese Red Guards are revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the successors of the proletarian cause. Today, China is able to carry out this Cultural Revolution because the successors of the proletarian cause not only grasp Mao Zedong Thought but also effectively apply it in practice. The Chinese Red Guards are trustworthy people who have been tested by the fiery trials of this Cultural Revolution. They have played a tremendous role in this Cultural Revolution.

		Laos		Ula

The Red Guards are the successors of the former Red Army of China. In China, workers and peasants are the masters of the state, and the Red Guards are the offspring of workers and peasants. They remember the sufferings of class oppression endured by their forebears, and therefore, they will not allow imperialism to enslave the Chinese people again.

		Congo (Brazzaville)		Obe Lenda

The Red Guards are guided by Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards are a constructive force, working for the welfare of the people. They only want to eliminate the traces left by imperialism, which are a disgrace to humanity. We do not expect imperialism and modern revisionism to praise the Red Guards or even speak the truth about them. However, as peace-loving people, we must highly respect the Red Guards, support, and praise their work.

    红卫兵赞
    在红卫兵成立以后，革命像洪流一样向前推进，荡涤掉一切同革命对抗的东西。红卫兵们在几天和几个星期之内实现了在几十年内没有能够做到的事情。他们在文化革命中起了先锋的作用。
                        锡兰　桑穆加塔桑
    中国的红卫兵小将们在当代列宁——毛泽东领导下，正在涤荡过去的污泥浊水，消除封建主义、资本主义和帝国主义的一切遗毒，为中国的巨大跃进开辟了道路；他们的经验和胜利，都将为马克思列宁主义的国际共产主义运动作出贡献。
    红卫兵的斗争是抵制资产阶级意识形态的渗透和腐蚀、防止出现或发展修正主义的最好屏障。这是革命的接班，它将不容许革命停顿、保守、开倒车。
    红卫兵的行动是破旧立新的革命行动，它将载入无产阶级领导的阶级斗争的史册。
                        法国《新人道报》
    红卫兵是毛泽东主席的红小兵，是革命前辈的继承人。我们亲眼看到了红卫兵的革命行动。他们大破四旧、大立四新，保护文物古迹等国家财产，很有成绩。这一切，有力地驳斥了资产阶级和修正主义报纸对红卫兵所制造的种种卑劣的谎言。
                            日本　清水正夫
    红卫兵是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，是最纯洁、最聪明、最觉悟、最勇敢、最革命的青少年。他们决心在文化大革命的烈火中，把自己锻炼成不怕苦，不怕死，一心一意为革命，全心全意为人民服务，祖国革命事业的最可靠的接班人。
                            日本　宫崎世民
    中国红卫兵是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命青少年，是无产阶级事业的接班人。今天中国之所以能够进行这场文化大革命，是因为无产阶级事业的接班人不仅掌握了毛泽东思想，而且能有效地应用到实践中去。中国红卫兵是经过这次文化大革命烈火考验的、可以信赖的人。他们在这场文化大革命中发挥了巨大的作用。
                                老挝　乌拉
    红卫兵是当年中国红军的继承人。在中国，工人、农民是国家的主人，红卫兵是工人、农民的子弟，他们牢记父辈过去受尽阶级压迫的痛苦，因此，帝国主义想重新奴役中国人民，他们是决不允许的。
                    刚果（布）　奥贝·伦达
    红卫兵是以毛泽东思想作为指导的。红卫兵是一支建设性的力量，它是为人民谋福利的。他们只是要消除帝国主义留下来的痕迹，这种痕迹是人类的耻辱。我们不期望帝国主义和现代修正主义赞扬红卫兵，或者甚至讲些有关红卫兵的真话。但是，我们作为爱好和平的人民，必须高度尊敬红卫兵，支持和赞赏他们的工作。
                        索马里　穆罕默德
