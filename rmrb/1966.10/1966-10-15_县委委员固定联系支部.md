    Editor,
    In recent years, the Communist Party of China's committee in Shanxi's Pingshun County has consistently implemented the system of county committee members fixing contact with grassroots branches. The main tasks are to personally give party lessons to the branches, guide party members in studying Chairman Mao's works, help the branches with party and non-party political and ideological work, and inspect and supervise the branches in strictly implementing various party life regulations.

    When this system was first implemented, some county committee members thought that having a deputy secretary to manage the branch work was enough; the county committee secretary and members should mainly manage production; otherwise, production would not improve, and it would be difficult to speak and account for it. In response to this situation, the county committee's responsible comrades organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "The Working Methods of the Party Committee" and other works, making everyone realize that the county committee must grasp the work of the grassroots if it wants to grasp the construction of the party branches. On the basis of unified thinking, the county committee often checks the implementation of this system, requiring county committee members to report on the situation of the branches they are in contact with when reporting their work. Therefore, whether it is the secretary or the committee members, they generally consciously implement this system.

    The result of Pingshun County Committee's consistent implementation of this system has formed a wind of the whole party grasping the work of the branches, continuously changing the face of the rural grassroots party organizations in the whole county, and continuously strengthening the fighting capacity of the party branches; it also enables the county committee to better understand the situation of the grassroots party organizations, which helps the county committee to implement correct leadership. I think this is a successful experience that can be referred to by other places.

    县委委员固定联系支部编辑同志：
    近几年来，中共山西平顺县委坚持执行县委委员固定联系基层支部的制度。主要任务是亲自给支部上党课，辅导党员学习毛主席著作，帮助支部做好党内外的政治思想工作，检查督促支部认真贯彻执行有关党内生活的各项制度。
    在刚开始实行这一制度的时候，有些县委委员认为，有县委副书记管支部工作就行了，县委书记和委员主要应管生产；否则生产上不去，话就不好说，账就不好交。针对这种情况，县委负责同志组织大家学习了毛主席的《党委会的工作方法》等著作，使大家认识到，县委要抓好基层工作，就非抓好党支部的建设不可。在思想一致的基础上，县委又经常抓紧检查执行这一制度的情况，规定县委成员汇报工作，先要汇报所联系支部的情况。因此，不论是书记还是委员，一般都能自觉地执行这一制度。
    平顺县委坚持执行这一制度的结果，形成了全党抓支部工作的风气，使全县农村基层党组织的面貌不断发生变化，党支部的战斗力不断加强；也使县委更好地了解了基层党组织的情况，有助于县委实行正确的领导。我以为这是一项成功的经验，可供其他地方参考。
