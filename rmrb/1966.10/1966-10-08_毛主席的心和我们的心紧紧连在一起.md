Editor's Note: In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, batches of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country have crossed mountains and rivers to come to the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Beijing, to the side of the great leader Chairman Mao. They have a common wish: to see with their own eyes the most beloved leader Chairman Mao, to express their boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, and to express their determination to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Our great leader Chairman Mao is always with the masses, always heart to heart with the masses. He has received the Cultural Revolution army time and time again. Each time Chairman Mao receives the Red Guards and revolutionary students, it greatly encourages the Red Guards and revolutionary masses throughout the country, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new high tide.

The color documentary films "Chairman Mao with the Million Strong Cultural Revolution Army," "Chairman Mao Receives the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students," and "Chairman Mao's Third Reception of the Million Revolutionary Youth" vividly portray the unforgettable scenes of Chairman Mao's three receptions of the Red Guards and revolutionary students, recording the touching scenes of the revolutionary youth and revolutionary students' boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Since the films were shown, revolutionary masses in the capital and throughout the country have sent letters and articles to this newspaper. They said: After watching the films, they all felt the greatest honor and happiness, and received the greatest encouragement and support. They unanimously expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, and seriously, thoroughly, completely, and unconditionally carry out the Sixteen Points, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and create a bright red new world.

Chairman Mao's Heart is Tightly Connected with Our Hearts

With boundless happiness and immense excitement, we watched the color documentaries "Chairman Mao Receives the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students" and "Chairman Mao's Third Reception of the Million Revolutionary Youth."

We saw on the screen the benevolent smile of our greatest and most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and saw that he is so healthy. We are truly overjoyed. Having the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and revolutionary people around the world!

Look, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, arrived in an open-top car at Tiananmen Square, among the vast Red Guards and revolutionary students. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" echoed through the capital's sky, and the entire square became a sea of happiness, with everyone immersed in joy.

Look, Chairman Mao, with his vigorous steps, ascended Tiananmen. He waved to the vast Red Guards and revolutionary students time and time again. The revolutionary students were too excited, they were so moved that they couldn't speak, and some shed tears of happiness. When we saw this, we also had tears in our eyes, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" with everyone. Our hearts flew with the revolutionary students to Tiananmen, to Chairman Mao's side, tightly connected with the heart of our great leader.

We all deeply feel that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the brightest red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people. It illuminates the path of our revolution and points out the direction of our advance. We must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good students and good soldiers of Chairman Mao; we must seriously, thoroughly, completely, and unconditionally carry out the Sixteen Points, and actively participate in the Cultural Revolution.

We are steel workers in the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing, by Chairman Mao's side. We must never forget Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and be the strong backbone of the revolutionary Red Guards. We must resolutely learn from the heroic 32111 Drilling Team, take the warriors of the 32111 Drilling Team as our example, imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, produce high-quality steel materials in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, seize the revolution and promote production, be a pioneer, and strive for double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production construction.

    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，各地一批又一批的红卫兵和革命师生，越过千山万水，来到了无产阶级文化大革命的中心北京，来到了伟大领袖毛主席的身边。他们有着一个共同的心愿：亲眼见到最敬爱的领袖毛主席，表达自己对毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的心情，表达自己读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士的决心。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，永远和群众在一起，永远和群众心连心，一次、再次、又一次地接见了文化革命大军。毛主席的每一次接见，都极大地鼓舞了红卫兵和全国广大革命群众，都把无产阶级文化大革命推向了一个新的高潮。
    彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》、《毛主席接见红卫兵和革命师生》和《毛主席第三次接见百万革命小将》，生动地表现了毛主席三次接见红卫兵和革命师生的令人难忘的情景，纪录了革命小将和革命师生无限热爱毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的感人的场面。影片上映以来，首都和全国广大革命群众纷纷给本报来信来稿。他们说：看了影片，都感到最大的光荣和幸福，得到了最大的鼓舞和支持。他们一致表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，响应林彪同志的号召，认真地、全面地、彻底地、不折不扣地执行十六条，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，创造一个红彤彤的新世界。

    我们怀着无限幸福、无比激动的心情，看了《毛主席接见红卫兵和革命师生》和《毛主席第三次接见百万革命小将》的彩色纪录片。
    我们看到银幕上出现我们最伟大的、最敬爱的领袖毛主席的慈祥笑容，看到他老人家这样健康，我们真是打心眼里高兴。我们有了伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，这是我们全中国和全世界革命人民最大的幸福啊！
    看，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志以及中央其他领导人，乘着敞篷汽车来到了天安门广场，来到了广大红卫兵和革命师生中间。“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的口号声响彻首都的上空，整个广场汇成了幸福的海洋，每个人都沉浸在幸福之中。
    看，毛主席迈着雄健的步伐登上了天安门，他一次又一次地向广大红卫兵和革命师生挥手致意。革命师生太兴奋了，他们感动得说不出话，有的流出了幸福的眼泪。我们看到这里，也是热泪盈眶，跟着大家喊“毛主席万岁！”我们的心也跟着广大革命师生飞向天安门，飞到了毛主席身边，和我们伟大领袖的心紧紧连在一起了。
    我们都深深感到，伟大的毛泽东思想是我们革命人民心中最红最红的太阳。它给我们照亮了革命的道路，指明了前进的方向。我们一定要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生、好战士；我们一定要认真地、全面地、彻底地、不折不扣地贯彻执行十六条，积极参加文化大革命。
    我们是在无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京，在毛主席身边的钢铁工人。我们一定不忘毛主席的教导，向解放军学习，誓做红卫兵革命小将的坚强后盾。我们一定坚决向英雄的32111钻井队学习，以32111钻井队的勇士们为榜样，把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，一定要多、快、好、省地生产优质钢材，抓革命，促生产，当一名闯将，誓夺文化革命和生产建设双胜利。
