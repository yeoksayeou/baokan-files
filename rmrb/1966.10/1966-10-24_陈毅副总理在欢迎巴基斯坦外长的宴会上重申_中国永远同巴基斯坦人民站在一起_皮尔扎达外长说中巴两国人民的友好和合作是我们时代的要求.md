Vice Premier Chen Yi, at a banquet welcoming the Pakistani Foreign Minister, reiterated that China will always stand with the Pakistani people. Foreign Minister Pirzada said that the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and Pakistan are a requirement of our times.

	BEIJING, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) — Vice Premier Chen Yi said at a banquet tonight welcoming the Pakistani Foreign Minister that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in our country is a great revolution to arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought. It will ensure that our 700 million people forever retain revolutionary youth, accelerate our socialist construction, strengthen our national defense, and enable us to more effectively implement Chairman Mao's diplomatic line and better fulfill our internationalist duties.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi said: Chairman Mao has said, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries have maliciously slandered our Cultural Revolution. This proves that what we are doing is completely correct. The more vigorously they oppose us, the more it proves that our work is successful. They vainly attempt to use this to sow discord and disrupt our relations with friendly countries in Asia and Africa, but they have completely miscalculated.

	At the banquet hosted by Vice Premier Chen Yi, who is also the Foreign Minister, and Zhang Qi, Pakistani Foreign Minister Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada and his wife received a warm welcome.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said, China-Pakistan friendship has not grown in a greenhouse; it has withstood the test of storms. Imperialism led by the United States, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries have never stopped their activities to sabotage China-Pakistan friendship. However, China-Pakistan friendship has not only not weakened but is growing stronger day by day.

	He said, Chairman Mao has said, "True, good, and beautiful things always exist and develop in struggle against false, evil, and ugly things." China-Pakistan friendship has developed through constant struggle against evil forces. He pointed out that the friendly relations between China and Pakistan are based on the fundamental interests of the two countries' peoples and on maintaining peace and security in this region. With such a solid foundation, China-Pakistan friendship is unbreakable by any force.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterated: The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys. The Chinese government and people will continue to develop friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This stance will not change. Vice Premier Chen Yi expressed that in the struggle of the Pakistani people to defend national independence, oppose Indian expansion, and resist foreign aggression, and in the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination, the Chinese government and people have stood with the Pakistani people in the past and will always stand with the Pakistani people in the future.

	Foreign Minister Pirzada said in his speech that Pakistan attaches great importance to its friendly relations with China. He pointed out that Sino-Pakistani friendship is built on the genuine fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples. He said, we should discard the directions imposed on us during the period of foreign rule. Our two countries can cooperate and exchange experiences in many aspects.

	Foreign Minister Pirzada said, the policies of our two countries provide a good foundation for strengthening our friendship. The friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Pakistan and China are a requirement of our times, and any attempt to obstruct this friendship will not succeed.

	Foreign Minister Pirzada thanked the Chinese government and people for their support for the just struggle of the Kashmiri people. He said, the Pakistani government and people will never forget the assistance and support given by the Chinese government and people when Pakistan was invaded. He pointed out that China's support for Pakistan's resistance to aggression is a stabilizing factor in South Asia.

	He finally raised his glass to toast the health and longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong.

	Before the banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi, who is also the Foreign Minister, and Zhang Qi met with Foreign Minister Pirzada and his wife and held a welcome reception.

	Those who attended the banquet and reception included Deputy Foreign Minister Han Nianlong and other responsible officials from relevant departments.

	Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan Muhammad Khan and diplomatic officials from the embassy were invited to attend the banquet and reception.

	Diplomats from various countries accredited to China were invited to attend the reception. (Photo attached)

    陈毅副总理在欢迎巴基斯坦外长的宴会上重申
    中国永远同巴基斯坦人民站在一起
    皮尔扎达外长说中巴两国人民的友好和合作是我们时代的要求
    新华社二十三日讯　陈毅副总理今晚在欢迎巴基斯坦外交部长的宴会上说：我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命是以伟大的毛泽东思想武装人们灵魂的大革命，它将使我国七亿人民永远保持革命的青春，加速我们的社会主义建设，增强我们的国防力量，使我们更有力地贯彻毛主席制定的外交路线，更好地执行我们应尽的国际主义义务。
    陈毅副总理说：毛主席说过，“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对我们的文化大革命进行了种种诬蔑，这证明我们做的是完全对的。它们反对得越起劲，就越加证明我们的工作很有成绩。它们妄图借此挑拨和破坏我们同亚非友好国家的关系，那是完全打错了算盘。
    在陈毅副总理兼外交部长和张茜今晚举行的宴会上，巴基斯坦外交部长赛义德·沙里夫丁·皮尔扎达和夫人，受到了热烈的欢迎。
    陈毅副总理在宴会开始时讲话。他说，中巴友谊的花朵不是在温室里长大的，它是经过了风浪的考验的。美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和印度反动派从来没有停止过破坏中巴友谊的活动。但是，中巴友谊不仅没有削弱，而且正在日益加强。
    他说，毛主席曾经说过：“真的、善的、美的东西总是在同假的、恶的、丑的东西相比较而存在，相斗争而发展的。”中巴友谊就是在同丑恶势力不断斗争中发展起来的。他指出，中巴两国友好关系是以两国人民的根本利益为基础的，是以维护这个地区的和平和安全为基础的，有着这样巩固基础的中巴友谊，是任何势力破坏不了的。
    陈毅副总理重申：中国政府和中国人民坚决支持亚非拉各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争，中国政府和中国人民将继续在和平共处五项原则的基础上同亚非各国发展友好合作关系，这个立场是决不会改变的。陈毅副总理表示，在巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立、反对印度扩张和外来侵略的斗争中，在克什米尔人民争取自决权利的斗争中，中国政府和中国人民过去同巴基斯坦人民站在一起，今后也将永远同巴基斯坦人民站在一起。
    皮尔扎达部长在讲话中说，巴基斯坦非常重视同中国的友好关系。他指出，巴中友谊是建筑在我们两国和人民真正的根本利益基础上的。他说，我们两国应该抛弃过去外国统治时期强加于我们的方向。我们两国在很多方面可以互相合作和互相交流彼此的经验。
    皮尔扎达部长说，我们两国的政策为加强我们两国的友谊提供了良好的基础。巴中两国人民的友好和合作是我们时代的要求，任何阻挡这种友谊的企图都是不会成功的。
    皮尔扎达部长感谢中国政府和中国人民对克什米尔人民正义斗争的支持。他说，巴基斯坦政府和人民永远不能忘记中国政府和人民在巴基斯坦遭到侵略的时候给予的援助和支持。他指出，中国支持巴基斯坦反抗侵略是南亚很稳定的因素。
    他最后举杯祝毛泽东主席健康长寿。
    在宴会之前，陈毅副总理兼外交部长和张茜会见了皮尔扎达部长和夫人，并举行了欢迎酒会。
    出席宴会和酒会作陪的，有外交部副部长韩念龙，以及其他有关方面的负责人。
    巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆罕默德·汗和使馆外交官员，应邀出席了宴会和酒会。
