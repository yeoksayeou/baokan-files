Sri Lankan Communist Party Central Committee Politburo Member and Secretariat Member Samugathasan pointed out in a speech to the masses in Colombo on the 19th that the anti-China conspiracies of the imperialists and a small handful of modern revisionists show how much they fear the revolutionary influence of the proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China.

He pointed out that modern revisionists are terrified because they are worried that the influence of China's proletarian cultural revolution will expand.

He said that the imperialists and modern revisionists are shouting loudly because the cultural revolution currently underway in China has shattered all their hopes of a peaceful evolution back to capitalism in China. Therefore, Johnson, along with Brezhnev, Tito, and others, have formed a holy alliance to slander the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards, launching an anti-China chorus on a global scale.

He also pointed out that the revisionists in Sri Lanka actually say that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is not led by the Chinese Communist Party, and that the Red Guards have no class basis. Nothing could be more absurd than this statement. Samugathasan said that during his recent visit to Beijing, he had conversations with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and several leaders of the Red Guards. He confidently said that the entire proletarian cultural revolution is being carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the personal guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong. The Red Guards have a solid proletarian foundation.

Samugathasan said that the news about the Chinese Cultural Revolution published in bourgeois and revisionist newspapers is fabricated.

In discussing China's religious freedom, he said that the Red Guards had told him that they respect the constitutional right of every person to have religious beliefs. However, they do not allow religion to be used as a cover for counter-revolutionary activities.

Samugathasan finally said that the purpose of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is to transform people's thinking, to eliminate all the bad thoughts left over from the exploiting classes, and to replace them with new proletarian thoughts, thereby eliminating the possibility of capitalist restoration, as happened in the Soviet Union.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, October 21st, Sri Lankan Afro-Asian Solidarity Association Chairman Thega Gunawadana said at a recent annual meeting of this association that Soviet revisionists have been hoping for a coup in China and a revisionist leadership, but this hope has been dashed by the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

She also said that so far, the fierce attacks on China have come from the revisionist clique and American imperialists, and their attacks on China have been thoroughly defeated. She said that the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are all grateful to China.

At the annual meeting held on October 18th, a resolution was passed praising and supporting the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The resolution said: "We express our support for the Chinese people who are now entering the revolutionary historical stage of consolidating socialism on the road to their predetermined goal."

    中国文化大革命使帝修怕得要死
    古纳瓦达纳夫人说亚非拉革命人民都感激中国
    新华社科伦坡二十二日电　锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑十九日在科伦坡向群众发表演说时指出，帝国主义者和一小撮现代修正主义者的反华阴谋，表明了他们是多么害怕中国现在正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命的革命影响。
    他指出，现代修正主义者感到恐惧，是由于他们担心，中国的无产阶级文化大革命的影响会扩大。
    他说，帝国主义者和现代修正主义者都在大叫大嚷，因为现在中国正在进行的文化大革命，粉碎了他们想使中国回复到资本主义的和平演变的一切希望。因此，约翰逊同勃列日涅夫、铁托等人建立了神圣同盟，诽谤中国文化大革命和红卫兵，展开了世界范围的反华大合唱。
    他还指出，锡兰的修正主义者竟然说中国文化大革命不是由中国共产党领导的，红卫兵没有阶级基础。再没有比这种说法更荒谬的了。桑穆加塔桑说，他最近在访问北京期间，同中国共产党的领导人以及几个红卫兵领导人谈了话。他充满信心地说，整个无产阶级文化大革命是在中国共产党领导下和毛泽东同志亲自指导下进行的。红卫兵具有牢固的无产阶级基础。
    桑穆加塔桑说，资产阶级和修正主义报纸刊载的关于中国文化大革命的消息是捏造的。
    他在谈到中国的宗教自由时说，中国的红卫兵曾对他说，他们尊重每一个人的宗教信仰这种宪法上规定的权利。但是，他们不允许把宗教作为掩护反革命活动的幌子。
    桑穆加塔桑最后说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的目的是要改造人的思想，消灭剥削阶级遗留下来的一切坏思想，而代之以无产阶级的新思想，从而消除像在苏联发生的那种资本主义复辟的一切可能性。
    据新华社科伦坡二十一日电　锡兰亚非团结协会主席特加·古纳瓦达纳夫人最近在这里举行的这个协会的年会上说，苏联修正主义者一心希望中国发生政变，出现修正主义领导，这个希望已由于中国文化大革命而破灭了。
    她还说，到目前为止，攻击中国的激烈言论都是修正主义集团和美帝国主义者发出的，他们对中国的攻击已遭到彻底的挫败。她说，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命人民都感激中国。
    在十月十八日举行的这次年会通过一项决议，赞扬和支持中国的文化大革命。决议说：“我们表示支持在走向预定目标的道路上，现在正进入巩固社会主义的革命历史阶段的中国人民。”
