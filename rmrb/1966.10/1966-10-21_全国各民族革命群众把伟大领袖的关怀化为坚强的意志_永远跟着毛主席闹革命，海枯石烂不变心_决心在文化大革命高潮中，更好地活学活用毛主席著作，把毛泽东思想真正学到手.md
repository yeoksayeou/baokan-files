The joyous news that our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has received revolutionary students and teachers from all over the country for the fourth time has spread like a spring breeze across the entire country. From the interior to the border regions, from cities to villages, revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups have once again been immersed in boundless joy and happiness.

On the day Chairman Mao inspected the cultural revolution army, many revolutionary youngsters who came to Beijing to be inspected immediately took the joyous news back to their battle stations; more regions sent telegrams and phone calls to their schoolmates. The next morning, when the radio broadcast this joyous news to the country, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and Red Guards, revolutionary students and teachers shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Everywhere was a scene of jubilation. Many revolutionary youngsters and masses took to the streets, beating drums and gongs, setting off firecrackers, singing revolutionary songs, and marching in procession; many factories, communes, and schools held discussion meetings, celebration meetings, and oath-taking meetings. The broad revolutionary masses and youngsters enthusiastically cheered for Chairman Mao's health and were greatly inspired by the great leader's boundless concern, support, and trust for the revolutionary masses. Revolutionary masses and youngsters of all ethnic groups across the country have turned the immense encouragement they received into a common resolve: to forever closely follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, to defend and carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Workers and commune members in Tianjin, Harbin, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Baoding, Nanjing, Jinan, Hefei, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, and other places said that Chairman Mao's repeated receptions of Red Guards and revolutionary students are the most affectionate care and encouragement for revolutionary youth, and also the most affectionate care and encouragement for us, the working class and commune members. With boundless excitement, they expressed their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and to smash anyone who opposes Chairman Mao. In the current high tide of the Cultural Revolution, they will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seize the revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production. The workers and families of the Daqing Oilfield said, "We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to build a first-class oilfield at high speed and high level. Now, we must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more seriously and diligently. Like the 32111 Hero Drilling Team, we will imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We will be the main force in the Cultural Revolution, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and create more and better new achievements on the spiritual and material fronts. We will sail forward on the revolutionary course opened by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, breaking waves and surging ahead."

Workers on the industrial and transportation front in Wuhan, active learners of Chairman Mao's works such as Ma Xueyi, said in a discussion on this joyous news, "Chairman Mao's repeated receptions of revolutionary youth are to let the youngsters bravely temper themselves and grow in class struggle, to become good successors of the revolution. This is a great cause that concerns the fate and future of our country and the world revolution. We, the working class, firmly support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and vow to be their strong rear guard." The chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association and old hero Jia Jincai of the Daqia Village in Shanxi Province said with great excitement, "Chairman Mao, you are forever in our hearts, forever our intimate friend, forever the guarantee of our revolutionary victory, forever the source of our strength. We will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to better study and apply your works. We will not be daunted by difficulties or lack of culture. We will definitely master Mao Zedong Thought and pass it down from generation to generation, never changing our hearts."

The villagers of Wuren Bridge Village in Anxian County, Hebei Province, which Chairman Mao visited, heard the joyous news and once again felt the happiness of seeing Chairman Mao eight years ago. The chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association, Guo Shouren, said, "We must forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution, promote production, and strive for even greater harvests next year on the basis of this year's significant increase in production." Metatou, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a villager from Shaxi Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, was picking cotton in the field when she heard this joyous news. She immediately joined everyone in singing "The East Is Red" and "The Great Helmsman," expressing her boundless love for the great leader. Metatou said, "I will study Chairman Mao's books well, keep Chairman Mao's words in my heart, imprint them in my mind, speak them with my mouth, and use them with my hands, and together with the villagers, turn the production team and brigade into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought."

The joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary youngsters flew over mountains and rivers, quickly reaching the regions where various ethnic minorities reside. Revolutionary masses of various ethnic minorities shouted in different languages, "Our most red, most red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, live forever!" In Lhasa, Tibetan revolutionary students, teachers, Red Guards, and workers and peasants sang enthusiastically: "The red sun rises on the golden mountains of Beijing, the snow mountains of Tibet are bright and clear, the red sun is Chairman Mao, the emancipated serfs will always be by your side." More than 700 students of the Tibet Autonomous Region Normal School solemnly swore to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao after listening to the broadcast: "We, the children of the 100 million emancipated serfs, will forever follow Chairman Mao, defend Chairman Mao with our lives, defend the Party Central Committee with our lives, defend Mao Zedong Thought with our lives, firmly defend and carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Cai Rangzhuoma, a Tibetan student from Qinghai Nationalities Institute, who saw the great leader Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Square during the National Day, said with great excitement, "I will carve the happiness of seeing Chairman Mao on National Day into my brain like carving on gold, never to forget! I will be a pioneer in the Cultural Revolution. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, who opposes the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we will definitely smash them!"

Yang Wenlie, a model worker of the Buyi and Miao ethnic groups from the Agricultural Machinery Factory in Kaili, Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, said, "I will stick to studying Chairman Mao's books until my death, listen to Chairman Mao's words without any discount, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions without any wavering, and follow Chairman Mao in making revolution until my death." In the snow-capped mountains and grasslands of Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, revolutionary students and teachers of various ethnic groups held grand meetings in many places. Tibetan Red Guards expressed in discussions that their parents and elder brothers have been following Chairman Mao in making revolution since the Red Army era. We must follow in their footsteps, forever love Chairman Mao and the Party, and follow the old man in making revolution for life.

Revolutionary youngsters and masses of various ethnic groups in Yinchuan took to the streets with their red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing songs composed with Chairman Mao's quotations, expressing their boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. Buyituersun, a Red Guard from the Xinjiang Post and Telecommunications School, opened his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" when he heard the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary youngsters again. Looking at the red cover page dyed with the soil from the Tiananmen Wall, he read the words "Long live Chairman Mao!" he wrote at that most happy moment, and tears welled up in his eyes. He told his classmates, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao! Having such a great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman as Chairman Mao is our greatest happiness and pride."

Yisabai, a Uygur steelworker and active learner of Chairman Mao's works from the Xinjiang No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, said, "The hearts of the Uygur people are forever with Chairman Mao. Gold is more precious than jade, but Chairman Mao's books are more precious than jade. I will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions and truly make studying Chairman Mao's works the first need of life." Eighteen young representatives of minority ethnic groups visiting Kunming said in their discussions, "Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious treasure, and Chairman Mao's books are the best revolutionary books. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution and building a new socialist frontier."

In the past two days, many towns far from the capital have been as festive as the capital and other cities. Revolutionary teachers, students, and workers in Fuzhou on the coastal defense front listened to the radio with great enthusiasm and shared the happiness and joy of revolutionary youngsters being inspected by Chairman Mao. They said, "With Chairman Mao guiding us, we dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea. If imperialism and all ghosts and monsters dare to touch a hair of ours, we will definitely break their backs. Revolutionary teachers and students from Fujian Forestry College, who recently saw Chairman Mao in the capital, firmly stated, "We are on the front line of defending the motherland and the front line of the cultural revolution. We will definitely make the cultural revolutionary fire lit by Chairman Mao burn even brighter and carry the cultural revolution through to the end, defending the ironclad proletarian state to the death."

In Nanning, workers and peasants' representatives who were conveying the joyous scene of being inspected by Chairman Mao in the capital on National Day immediately held a discussion when they heard that Chairman Mao had received revolutionary youngsters again. They said, "With such revolutionary successors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, our ironclad proletarian state will definitely remain unshakable for thousands of years. In the border city of Yining, drums and gongs resounded, and revolutionary masses of more than ten ethnic groups shouted in unison, 'Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!' In the border city of Manzhouli, Red Guards and revolutionary students, upon hearing the joyous news, enthusiastically looked towards the capital and shouted, 'Long live Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao lives forever!' Students from Manzhouli Middle School unanimously expressed, 'We have boundless love, loyalty, and faith in the great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.' In Tumen City, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups held a grand celebration meeting. They said, 'Although we are on the border of the motherland, our hearts have long flown to Beijing, to Chairman Mao's side.' Students of Korean and Han ethnic groups from the First Middle School in Jian County immediately shouted, 'Long live Chairman Mao!' Many people jumped and shouted, expressing a solemn vow with thousands of words: 'We can die, we can shed blood, but Mao Zedong Thought will never be abandoned; the sea can dry up, the stones can crumble, but our red hearts following Chairman Mao in making revolution will never change.'

In many middle schools and universities in Chongqing, Red Guards and revolutionary students were overjoyed when they heard that their comrades who had traveled long distances to the capital had been inspected by Chairman Mao. Revolutionary students said, "As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and inherit the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle, we will definitely trample all great difficulties underfoot and achieve countless victories. Some Red Guards in Chongqing, upon hearing the broadcast in the early morning of the 19th, immediately jumped out of bed in excitement, not even bothering to put on their outer clothes, and shouted along with the loudspeaker, 'Long live Chairman Mao!' Among the revolutionary youngsters inspected by Chairman Mao in Beijing, there were more than a thousand of their comrades who had walked more than 300 li before taking the train north. These Red Guards expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle of these comrades, to follow Chairman Mao's words, and to temper their revolutionary will in the great winds and waves of class struggle. The joyous news reached the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan, and the broad revolutionary masses were extremely excited. Red Guards from Jinggangshan Middle School said, 'Chairman Mao, we offer you millions of red hearts! We are the descendants of the revolutionary people of Jinggangshan. Our parents and elder brothers followed you, holding long spears and big knives to conquer the world. Today, we will definitely take over and pass down the revolutionary red flag, following you in making revolution forever, generation after generation."

The great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, with a radiant face and full of vigor, stood on an open car and inspected the 150 million cultural revolution army cheering along the route. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary movement of the masses the most. We must turn Chairman Mao's care and trust into new fighting strength, firmly carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
