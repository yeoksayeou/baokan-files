Implementing Chairman Mao's wise decision to forge our own path in industrial development

China produces first batch of 100,000 kilowatt water turbine generators

Workers at the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant have successfully designed and manufactured the country's first batch of 100,000 kilowatt water turbine generators, achieving both speed and quality. Two sets of these generators have been installed and put into operation, demonstrating performance and parameters that surpass imported counterparts.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 7th: Workers at the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to act, dare to break through, and dare to innovate. They have successfully designed and manufactured China's first batch of 100,000 kilowatt water turbine generators at high speed and with high quality. Two sets of these generators have already been installed and put into operation. The results of several months of operation show that the quality of domestically produced water turbine generators is excellent, and their performance and parameters surpass those of imported counterparts.

The 100,000 kilowatt water turbine generator is a high-tech, large-scale power generation equipment. It includes a water turbine, generator, and many complex auxiliary devices, and when installed, it stands as tall as an eight-story building. One such set can generate approximately 600 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, equivalent to the power needed to mine 30 million tons of coal or weave over 10 billion meters of cloth. Its successful manufacture marks a new level in China's power generation equipment manufacturing technology.

The birth of the 100,000 kilowatt water turbine generator is a victory of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a new triumph for the workers in China's machinery industry who have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's wise decision to break free from foreign constraints and forge our own path in industrial development.

Some bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" with a pro-foreign mindset once claimed that China could not produce such large-capacity, high-demand hydroelectric equipment; even if it were produced, the quality could not be guaranteed, and it could not be used in important power stations. They advocated for imports, arguing that "silk clothes are better than cotton clothes." The Soviet modern revisionist clique exploited this, making a big fuss and attempting to control us. Workers at the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, through studying Chairman Mao's works and discussing the situation, deeply understood that whether or not we could quickly and successfully produce the 100,000 kilowatt water turbine generator was a matter of opposing imperialism and revisionism, of whether to carry out thorough revolution, dare to shoulder revolutionary responsibilities, and dare to catch up with international standards. They resolved to produce the 100,000 kilowatt generator to bring glory to the motherland and to Chairman Mao.

From the beginning of the trial production, workers proposed the goal of achieving "high speed and high standards." Without ready-made blueprints or data, and with the need to design such a large-capacity, high-tech product in a short time, this was indeed a new challenge for most of the young technicians who had just graduated. However, the Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has no insurmountable difficulties and no impassable barriers. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions that "correct ideas can only come from social practice, from the three kinds of social practice—production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." They went to the users, treating the nation's hydropower stations as a living repository of data, learning from veteran workers, and conducting extensive surveys and scientific experiments. Many important projects and key components were adopted in the design structure only after multiple trials, sometimes even hundreds of trials.

During the manufacturing process, workers also followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "the world fears nothing more than the words 'seriousness.' The Communist Party is the most serious about 'seriousness.'" They were meticulous in every detail and serious in every aspect, treating the production battle as a political battle, and many moving stories emerged. The workers in the grinding group, with the spirit of "Moving Mountains," ground the 50-ton rotor blades to a golden luster, surpassing the smoothness of foreign products. Some components had low precision requirements, but the workers insisted on treating "rough" work as fine work. For some processes, the quality requirements were difficult to specify in writing, so they proposed that if there were no fixed standards, they would set living standards. They conducted evaluations every shift, and whoever did it well set the standard.

During the manufacturing process, workers also adopted the method of combining internal and external efforts, breaking many constraints, and solving many key technical problems.

The successful trial production of the 100,000 kilowatt water turbine generator fully demonstrated the power of communist great cooperation and the superiority of the socialist system. Seventeen factories and enterprises across the country were responsible for the trial production of new materials, new components, new supporting equipment, and instruments needed for the generator sets. To solve the problems encountered in the trial production process, ten scientific research institutions and universities conducted a large amount of work. Workers at a certain heavy machinery manufacturing plant dared to think and act, not only casting a 150-ton large steel ingot but also successfully using the internationally advanced large-section electroslag welding technology to weld a shaft with a diameter of over one meter, thus solving the biggest key problem in the manufacturing process.

### 我国制成第一批十万瓩水轮发电机组

    贯彻执行毛主席关于走自己工业发展道路的英明决策
    我国制成第一批十万瓩水轮发电机组
    哈尔滨电机厂职工又快又好地设计制成这种大型发电设备，其中两套机组投入生产的运转情况表明，性能和参数超过了外国进口的同样机组。
    新华社哈尔滨七日电　哈尔滨电机厂广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢创的无产阶级革命精神，高速度、高质量地设计制造成功我国第一批十万瓩水轮发电机组，其中的两套机组已经安装并且投入生产。几个月来的运转结果表明，国产水轮发电机组的质量很好，性能和参数，超过了外国进口的同样机组。
    十万瓩水轮发电机组是技术要求很高的大型发电设备。它包括水轮机、发电机和许多复杂的附属装置，安装起来有八层楼高。一套这样的机组每年可以发电六亿度左右，相当于开采三千万吨煤或织一百多亿尺布所用的电力。它的制造成功，标志着我国发电设备的制造技术达到了一个新的水平。
    十万瓩水轮发电机组的诞生，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是我国机械工业部门职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的关于打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路的英明决策的新胜利。
    有些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”和具有崇洋思想的人曾经断言，像十万瓩水轮发电机组这样大容量、高要求的水电设备，我国是做不出来的；即使勉强做出来，也保证不了质量，不能用在重要电站上。他们主张从国外进口，理由是：“绸衣裳总比布衣服强”。苏联现代修正主义集团利用这一点，大作文章，妄图卡住我们的脖子。哈尔滨电机厂的广大职工通过大学毛主席著作，大讲形势，深刻地认识到：能否又快又好地造出十万瓩水轮发电机组，是关系到反帝反修的大问题，是要不要彻底革命，敢不敢挑革命重担，敢不敢赶超国际水平的问题。他们立志要把十万瓩机组造出来，为祖国争光，为毛主席争光。
    试制工作一开始，职工们就提出实现“高速度、高水平”的要求。没有现成图纸，没有资料，要在短时间内设计出这样容量大、技术要求高的产品，对绝大部分是刚出校门的年轻技术人员来说，确实是一个新课题。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，没有克服不了的困难，没有攻不下的难关。他们遵照毛主席关于“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来”的教导，深入到用户中去，把全国水电站作为活的资料宝库，拜老工人为师，大搞调查研究和科学实验。许多重要项目和关键部件，都是经过多次试验，甚至经过几百次试验才在设计结构上采用。在制造过程中，职工们还遵照毛主席关于“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’”的教导，事事严格，处处认真，他们把生产仗当做政治仗打，涌现了很多生动的、感人的事迹。铲磨小组工人发扬“愚公移山”精神，硬把五十吨的转子叶片磨得金光耀目，超过了国外产品的光洁度。有些部件精度要求不高，但是工人们却提出“粗”活要当细活干。有的工序，质量要求很难用文字规定，他们就提出，没有死的标准就订活的标准。他们每班进行评比，谁干的好，谁的就是标准。
    在制造过程中，职工们还采取厂内外三结合的办法，打破了很多框框，解决了很多技术关键问题。
    十万瓩水轮发电机组的试制成功，充分显示了共产主义大协作的威力，显示了社会主义制度的优越性。全国有十七个工厂企业担负了机组需要的新材料、新元件、新的配套设备和仪表的试制工作。为了解决试制研究过程中的难题，有十个科学研究机关和高等学校进行了大量的工作。某重型机器制造厂的职工，敢想敢干，不仅铸出了重一百五十吨的大钢锭，而且成功地采用了具有国际水平的大截面电渣焊技术，焊成了直径一米多的大轴，从而解决了制造过程中一个最大的关键问题。（附图片）
