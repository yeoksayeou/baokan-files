The news of China's successful test of nuclear missiles has strongly shaken American imperialism. Western news agencies reported from Washington that China's announcement "shocked American officials" and "left Washington stunned." On the 28th, U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey hastily convened a meeting with high-ranking U.S. government officials to discuss China's successful test of nuclear missiles.

After maintaining silence for more than a day, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 28th, feigning composure by saying that China's test was conducted "within the period the U.S. had anticipated." However, this is merely a lie to cover up their panic. In a news report on the 27th, the Associated Press admitted that U.S. officials had previously doubted whether China could produce a missile with a nuclear warhead within ten years. American imperialism also attempted to downplay the significance of China's test, claiming that its "propaganda and psychological impact" was much greater than its military significance. However, this cannot conceal the anxiety of American imperialists. On the 28th, the French newspaper *Combat* pointed out that this test was a "bolt from the blue" for Johnson. Agence France-Presse also reported that due to China's successful launch of nuclear missiles, Johnson's visit to Bangkok on the 28th was overshadowed by a "gloomy atmosphere."

American bourgeois politicians and media also had to acknowledge China's significant achievements in developing nuclear weapons and missiles. On the 28th, Republican Senator Hickenlooper said, "I don't know of any other country that has successfully launched a missile on its first attempt and hit the target." "Launching such a set of weapons requires a fairly complex mechanical engineering and physical plan." The *Washington Post* also acknowledged on the 28th that China had become a "nuclear power," which is a "reality" that the West must acknowledge.

American imperialism and its propaganda machine took the opportunity to viciously attack China and incite anti-China sentiment, advocating for closer U.S.-Soviet collusion. On the 28th, the Associated Press shouted that China's test was a "threat," and the U.S. needed to "devise a way to deal with China." On the 28th, U.S. Vice President Humphrey shouted that China was a "common threat" to the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and emphasized that colluding with the Soviet revisionist clique to conclude a "non-proliferation treaty" had become the U.S.'s "primary concern." He even attempted to include China in this treaty, tying the hands of the Chinese people in defending their national security and safeguarding world peace.

### 红色核导弹腾空起　华盛顿黯然一片愁  美国官方强作镇静掩盖不了内心的惊慌

    红色核导弹腾空起　华盛顿黯然一片愁
    美国官方强作镇静掩盖不了内心的惊慌
    新华社二十九日讯  中国导弹核武器试验成功的消息强烈地震动了美帝国主义。西方通讯社从华盛顿发出的消息说，中国宣布的消息“使美国官员们大吃一惊”，“使华盛顿目瞪口呆”。美国副总统汉弗莱二十八日匆匆同美国政府高级官员举行会议，讨论中国导弹核武器试验成功的事情。
    美国国务院在保持了一天多的沉默之后，在二十八日发表了一个声明，强作镇静地说什么中国这次试验是在美国“预见的时期之内”进行的。但是，这不过是用撒谎来掩盖自己的惊慌。美联社在二十七日的一条消息中承认，美国官员本来认为，中国能否在十年内制造装有核弹头的导弹，“是值得怀疑的”。美帝国主义还妄图贬低中国这次试验的成就和意义，说什么它的“宣传上”、“心理上”的意义“比军事上的意义大得多”。但是，这掩盖不了美帝国主义者的不安。法国《战斗报》二十八日指出，这次试验对约翰逊是一个“晴天霹雳”。法新社也报道说，由于中国成功地发射了导弹核武器，约翰逊二十八日访问曼谷时“阴暗的气氛占了上风”。
    美国资产阶级政客和报刊也不得不承认中国在发展核武器和导弹方面的巨大成就。共和党参议员希肯卢珀二十八日说：“我还不知道有任何别的国家在第一次试验中就成功地发射出一枚导弹，并且使它命中目标。”“把这样一套武器发射出去，是要有一套相当复杂的机械工程和物理计划的”。《华盛顿邮报》二十八日也承认，中国已经是“一个核国家”，这是西方必须承认的“现实”。
    美帝国主义和它的宣传机器还借机恶毒攻击中国和煽动反华，鼓吹美苏加紧勾结。美联社二十八日叫嚷中国这次试验是一种“威胁”，美国要“拟订出一套对付中国的办法”。美国副总统汉弗莱二十八日叫嚷中国是对美苏的“一个共同的威胁”，并且强调勾结苏联修正主义集团缔结一项“防止核扩散”条约已经成为美国“关注的首要问题”。他甚至还妄想把中国也套进这个条约，束缚中国人民保卫自己祖国安全和保卫世界和平的手脚。
