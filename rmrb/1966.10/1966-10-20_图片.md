Title: Chairman Mao on the Spirit of Lu Xun
Author: Zhou Sicong
Date: 1966-10-20
Edition: 6

Chairman Mao said, "Lu Xun's two lines of poetry, 'Frowning at a thousand accusing fingers, bowing my head to become an ox for the children,' should be our guiding principle. 'A thousand' here refers to the enemy. We will never yield to any vicious enemy. 'Children' here refers to the proletariat and the masses. All communists, all revolutionaries, and all revolutionary literary and artistic workers should learn from Lu Xun's example, become an 'ox' for the proletariat and the masses, dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly until our last breath."

	Lu Xun's Manuscript
	The great writer, thinker, and revolutionary—Lu Xun
	In November 1932, Lu Xun returned to Beijing from Shanghai and was warmly welcomed by many students from universities and colleges in Beijing. He was invited to give speeches in various places. This is Lu Xun giving a speech at Beijing Normal University.

	This is the first edition of Lu Xun's collection of essays from his later years.
	Throughout his life of struggle, Lu Xun wrote many brilliant essays. Chairman Mao said, "Lu Xun was under the rule of dark forces and had no freedom of speech, so he fought using the form of satirical essays. Lu Xun was completely correct." Chairman Mao also pointed out, "Lu Xun's essays from his later years are the most profound and powerful, and they have no one-sidedness."

	This is part of Lu Xun's "Reply to the Trotskyites" published in the July 1936 issue of _Literature Miscellany_. This letter sharply refutes the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the Trotskyites. At the same time, in this letter, Lu Xun, with boundless respect and revolutionary affection, praises our great leader Chairman Mao. Lu Xun wholeheartedly supports Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership.

	In the struggle against the enemy, Lu Xun always led the youth to bravely charge into battle. With boundless enthusiasm, he cared for the growth of the youth and inspired them to fight. At the same time, he saw the hope and future of China in the vigorous revolutionary youth, which strengthened his revolutionary faith and fighting spirit. This depicts Lu Xun receiving young visitors late at night.

    毛主席说“鲁迅的两句诗，‘横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛’，应该成为我们的座右铭。‘千夫’在这里就是说敌人，对于无论什么凶恶的敌人我们决不屈服。‘孺子’在这里就是说无产阶级和人民大众。一切共产党员，一切革命家，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”
    鲁迅手迹
    伟大的文学家、思想家和革命家——鲁迅
    一九三二年十一月，鲁迅从上海回到北京，受到北京许多大中学校学生的热烈欢迎，各处纷纷请他讲演。这是鲁迅在北京师范大学向学生讲演的情形。
    这是鲁迅后期杂文集的初版本。
    在鲁迅战斗的一生里，写下了许多光辉的杂文。毛主席说：“鲁迅处在黑暗势力统治下面，没有言论自由，所以用冷嘲热讽的杂文形式作战，鲁迅是完全正确的。”毛主席又指出：“鲁迅后期的杂文最深刻有力，并没有片面性”。
    这是一九三六年七月发表在《文学丛报》上的鲁迅《答托洛斯基派的信》的一部分。这封信尖锐地驳斥了托派的反革命谬论。同时在这封信里，鲁迅怀着无限崇敬和热爱的革命感情，赞颂了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。鲁迅对毛主席的英明领导是衷心拥护的。
    在和敌人的搏斗中，鲁迅总是带领青年勇敢地冲锋陷阵。他怀着满腔的热忱，关怀着青年的成长，鼓舞着他们去战斗。同时，他也从朝气蓬勃的革命青年身上，看到了中国的希望和未来，从而增强了革命的信心和战斗的勇气。这里描绘的是鲁迅在深夜里接见青年来访者的情形。　　　　周思聪画
