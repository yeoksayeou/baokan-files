Under the banner of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, Shanghai's scientific and technical personnel and workers, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, have broken away from superstition, liberated their minds, and forged their own path. After eight years of effort, they have successfully synthesized the important chemical raw material benzene, opening up a new avenue for benzene production in China.

Editor's Note: In just eight years, China has overcome a scientific and technological challenge that Western countries have been pursuing for nearly a century without success—the synthesis of the important chemical raw material benzene—and has begun production. This is a great boost to the morale of the revolutionary people and a significant blow to the arrogance of imperialism and modern revisionism.

The birth of synthetic benzene in China is a brilliant victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The scientific and technical personnel and workers of relevant research institutions in Shanghai, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, have broken away from superstition, liberated their minds, and dared to tackle a challenge that Westerners have not overcome in a century. They have shown the great heroic spirit of the Chinese people. With sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm and a scientific spirit of seeking truth, they have persevered through numerous trials and tribulations, conducted repeated experiments, and fought relentlessly until they achieved success.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will certainly continue to create miracles.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 16th—The scientific and technical personnel and workers of relevant research institutions in Shanghai, under the banner of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, dared to tread a path that no one else has taken. In just eight years, they have overcome a scientific and technological challenge that Western countries have been pursuing for nearly a century without success—the synthesis of the important chemical raw material benzene—and have begun production, writing a glorious chapter in the history of the world's chemical industry.

This project, during its research and experimental phase, received the cooperation and support of many factories and schools in Shanghai and the East China region.

Currently, in a synthetic benzene plant in Shanghai, the production equipment is running smoothly. Pure synthetic benzene flows like tap water day and night, and its quality far surpasses benzene extracted from coking and oil refining processes. This fact once again proves that when Chinese workers and scientific and technical personnel are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they demonstrate boundless creative abilities.

Benzene is a crucial raw material for manufacturing plastics, synthetic rubber, synthetic fibers, dyes, and pesticides, among other things. Both national economic construction and national defense construction require large quantities of benzene. However, up to this point, all countries in the world can only extract benzene from coking and oil refining processes, limiting its production. Some industrially advanced countries have been trying to expand the sources of benzene for nearly a century, but they are still groping and experimenting.

The question is, should we dare to tackle a challenge that advanced Western industrial countries have not been able to achieve, or should we be intimidated by it? This struggle of ideas has been present throughout the entire process of researching synthetic benzene. When selecting the research topic of synthetic benzene, some people opposed it, saying, "Foreign countries haven't succeeded yet, why should we be able to?" However, some young technical personnel and workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, with the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat daring to practice and transform the world, declared, "We must dare to tackle the challenge that foreigners have not overcome in a century!"

After the research began, the first technical problem they encountered was finding a suitable catalyst for producing synthetic benzene. Should they explore on their own or follow in someone else's footsteps? This was another serious struggle. Initially, the researchers were not free from the constraints of foreign frameworks and copied the catalysts used in foreign experiments. However, after numerous failed attempts, they realized that following in someone else's footsteps would not lead to success. They decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, break away from superstition, liberate their minds, and forge their own path. They divided into five groups to explore new catalysts in practice. They prepared one possible catalyst after another for experiments, often conducting one or two experiments per day, sometimes even ten times a day. They held a firm belief: benzene is a material urgently needed by the state, and we must succeed in our research to contribute to socialist construction and to the pride of the Chinese people! Difficulties could not deter them, and explosions could not frighten them. After more than half a year of repeated experiments, they finally developed a relatively ideal catalyst, bringing the research a significant step closer to success.

Just as the experiments showed promising results, the country faced natural disasters and temporary economic difficulties. Class struggles were intense, and those who doubted and opposed the Great Leap Forward raised a cold wind, calling for the project to be halted. Bourgeois "authorities" tried every means to sabotage this research, which was of great significance to China's socialist construction. They cited numerous foreign documents to intimidate those who persisted in the experiments, saying, "This topic has baffled foreigners for nearly a century, how can we succeed?" They also encouraged people to work on smaller, more easily successful topics, using fame and fortune to shake their resolve. A "doctor" who had studied in the U.S. even conducted a "counter-experiment" to prove that using this catalyst would "necessarily fail," attempting to overturn the achievements already made. The young researchers insisted on continuing the experiments. This "authority" remained unyielding, delaying the approval of the research plan proposed by the young researchers and creating obstacles for the necessary materials, hindering the continuation of the experiments. The young researchers fought resolutely against these bourgeois "authorities" and did not retreat.

At the most critical moment of the struggle, the Party organization provided the strongest support to the young scientific and technical workers. The leaders of the research institution fully affirmed the achievements of the young researchers and clearly stated: synthetic benzene must be pursued and will succeed. Success in ten years is fast, and success in fifteen years is not late! They also instructed the internal departments of the research institution, such as machinery, supply, and administration, to "green-light" the research on synthetic benzene, providing extremely favorable conditions. This effectively stopped the "halt" wind.

The Party's expectations inspired the young researchers to fight with even greater determination. At that time, the synthetic reaction was still unstable. Should they persist on their own path or give up halfway? Some people with weak wills and serious thoughts of personal gain still had doubts and wavered. At this time, the Party's teachings helped the young researchers realize: researching synthetic benzene is a struggle against imperialism and revisionism, a political battle that must be won, not lost! Facing those pessimistic views of "doing nothing," the young pioneers who were determined to scale the heights of world science firmly believed: human factors come first, and with Mao Zedong Thought, we can certainly master the objective laws of nature. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," they focused on the main contradictions and conducted tenacious experiments. Through multiple cycles of practice leading to knowledge, knowledge leading to practice, and repeated cycles of recognition and practice, they finally found the causes of the experimental instability and took various measures to address these issues. The small-scale experiments on synthetic benzene finally succeeded.

In the latter half of 1964, the institution researching synthetic benzene launched a great socialist education movement. The researchers of the synthetic benzene project, in this struggle to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements, held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. They studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all their work. They established the "five definite" system for studying Chairman Mao's works: definitely study at the beginning of each task, definitely study when encountering difficulties, definitely study when discovering negative tendencies, definitely study when achieving results and progress, and definitely study when a task is completed. Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength, and the entire team was filled with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm, rapidly conducting model experiments. Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." The researchers of synthetic benzene, taking the Daqing oil workers as an example, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work, self-reliance, and seizing the day, rapidly mastering the new technology and achieving success in model experiments. On this basis, they immediately began industrial-scale trials of the synthetic benzene plant. They refuted the idea of some people that they could take their time, daring to think, speak, and act, breaking through old rules and practices, and implementing a method of conducting small experiments, model experiments, and intermediate experiments in parallel. At the same time, in the design and construction of the synthetic benzene plant, they implemented a "three-in-one" approach with the research team, design team, and construction team, greatly saving manpower, materials, and time, and speeding up the process. In this way, they quickly built the world's first synthetic benzene plant using their own created process route.

Early this year, with the cooperation of relevant factories, the synthetic benzene plant successfully conducted its first trial run. Using this synthetic method to produce benzene has a high yield and requires less investment and quicker setup. This type of plant can be built nationwide, thus opening up a new and broad path for benzene production in China.

    毛主席教导我们：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”我国人民在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下，一定能够不断创造出人间奇迹来。
    新华社上海十六日电　上海有关研究单位的科学技术工作人员和职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢于走前人没有走过的路，用八年时间，攻克了西方国家探求了近百年而没有解决的科学技术难题——用合成的方法获得重要的化工原料苯，并投入了生产，在世界化学工业史上写下了光辉的一页。
    这个项目在研究试验过程中，得到了上海及华东地区不少工厂和学校的配合、协作。
    现在，在上海一个生产合成苯的车间里，生产装置正在正常地运转，纯净的合成苯像自来水一样日夜畅流，质量远远超过了从炼焦、炼油过程中提炼出来的苯。这一事实再一次雄辩地证明：我国工人和科学技术工作者一旦用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来，就显示出了无比的创造才能。
    苯是制造塑料、合成橡胶、合成纤维、染料以及农药等重要的基本原料。国家的经济建设和国防建设都需要大量的苯。但到目前为止，世界各国都只能从炼焦、炼油过程中提取苯，产量受到限制。一些工业发达的国家近百年来一直设法扩大苯的来源，至今仍在摸索试验。
    西方工业生产先进的国家长期没有做到的事情，我们是敢于去闯，还是为它所吓倒？两种思想的斗争一直贯串着合成苯的整个研究过程。在选择合成苯这一研究课题时，就有人站出来反对，说：“外国至今还没有搞出来，我们凭什么能搞成！”但是一些青年技术人员和工人遵照毛主席的教导，以敢于实践、敢于改造世界的无产阶级革命气魄，发出了豪言壮语：“偏要闯一闯外国人百年未过的难关！”研究工作开始后，遇到的第一个技术问题是，要寻找一种适用于生产合成苯的最理想的催化剂。是自己摸索，还是跟在人家后面爬行？这又是一个严重的斗争。研究人员起先没有摆脱洋框框的束缚，照搬了外国试验时使用的催化剂。结果，试来试去，总是失败。他们从中吸取了经验教训，醒悟到：人家还没有搞成功，我们跟在他们屁股后面打转转，怎么能搞出名堂来呢？他们决心遵照毛主席的教导，破除迷信，解放思想，走自己的路。他们分兵五路，到实践中去探索新的催化剂。他们制备一种又一种可能适用的催化剂进行试验，每人每天几乎都要试一、两次，有时一天甚至试十来次。他们心里怀着一个坚定的信念：苯是国家迫切需要的物资，我们一定要研究成功，为社会主义建设出力，为中国人民争气！困难难不住他们，燃烧、爆炸吓不倒他们。经过半年多的反复试验，终于配制成一种较理想的催化剂，使研究工作向胜利跨进了一大步。
    试验刚有了良好的开端，就遇到了我国遭受自然灾害、经济暂时困难时期，社会上阶级斗争很激烈，那些怀疑、反对大跃进的人，对合成苯这个对我国社会主义建设有重大意义的研究课题，刮起了一股竭力叫喊下马的冷风。资产阶级“权威”千方百计地想搞垮这项研究，他们翻了一大堆外国文献，一再吓唬坚持试验的人们，说什么“这个专题外国人搞了近百年没有成功，奥妙得很，我们怎么行？”同时又动员人去搞一些容易出成果的小专题，用名利来动摇军心。一个留美的“博士”，甚至出马进行一种“反试验”，企图证明用这种催化剂进行试验“必然失败”，来推翻已经取得的成果。青年们坚持进行试验。这个“权威”仍不甘心，他迟迟不批准青年们制定的研究计划；试验需要的各种材料，他也多方刁难，拖后腿，阻挠试验继续进行。青年们同这些资产阶级“权威”展开了坚决的斗争，没有后退一步。
    在斗争最尖锐的时刻，党组织给了青年科学技术工作者最有力的支持。研究单位的领导人充分肯定青年们的成绩，明确表示：合成苯一定要搞下去，一定能搞下去。十年成功算快，十五年成功也不算迟！同时，还指示研究单位内部机修、供销、行政等部门为合成苯的研究“开绿灯”，提供极为有利的条件。这样，就把那股“下马风”煞住了。
    党的殷切期望，鼓舞着青年们以更大的决心去战斗。当时，合成反应还不稳定。是坚定地沿着自己的路走下去呢，还是半途而废？有些意志薄弱、名利思想比较严重的人，对此仍然怀疑、动摇。这时，党的教导使青年们认识到：搞合成苯，是同帝国主义、修正主义作较量，是一场反帝、反修的政治仗，这一仗，只能打胜，不能打败！面对那些“无所作为”的悲观论调，决心攀登世界科学高峰的青年小将们坚信：人的因素第一，我们有毛泽东思想，就一定能掌握自然的客观规律。他们根据毛主席在《实践论》、《矛盾论》中的教导，抓住主要矛盾进行顽强的试验，通过实践到认识，由认识到实践、认识、再实践、再认识的多次反复，终于找到了试验不稳定的原因，针对这些原因采取了各种措施，合成苯的小型试验终于获得了成功。
    一九六四年下半年，研究合成苯的单位开展了伟大的社会主义教育运动，合成苯专题的科学研究人员在这场灭资兴无的思想斗争中，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，时时处处活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针，还建立了“五个一定”学习毛主席著作的制度：每一段工作开始的时候一定学，遇到困难的时候一定学，发现不良“苗子”的时候一定学，取得成绩和进展的时候一定学，工作告一段落的时候一定学。毛主席的亲切教导，给了他们无穷的力量，全组同志斗志昂扬，革命干劲冲天，迅速进行模型试验。毛主席说：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”合成苯研究人员以大庆石油工人为榜样，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生和只争朝夕的革命精神，迅速地掌握了新工艺，取得模型试验的成功。在此基础上，他们又立即动手进行一定规模的合成苯车间的工业性试验。他们驳斥了有些人认为可以慢慢来的论调，敢想、敢说、敢干，冲破了陈规旧套，实行小试验、模型试验、中间试验相互交叉进行的办法。同时，在合成苯车间设计、建造中，又实行了专题研究组同设计、施工单位“三结合”，大大节约了人力、物力和时间，争取了速度。就这样，他们用自己创造出来的工艺路线，迅速建成了世界上第一座合成苯车间。
    今年年初，这个合成苯车间在有关工厂协作下，第一次试车就取得了成功。用这种合成的方法生产苯，得率很高，而且投资少，上马快。这种车间可以在全国遍地开花，从而为我国苯的生产开辟了一条崭新的广阔的道路。（附图片）
