Chairman Mao said: To make progress in thought and politics, one must study Marxism and current political affairs. Without correct political views, one is as good as having no soul.

Refuting Kuang Yaming's "Intellectual Education First"

Chairman Mao said: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education, and become socially conscious laborers with culture." However, Kuang Yaming has brought out a set of revisionist goods to oppose Mao Zedong's educational thoughts. He said: "To measure whether a student has made progress, first see if they study well," "To measure whether a teacher is a good teacher, first see if they diligently teach and are responsible to students, and have a relatively high academic level." In short, regardless of political ideology, as long as one's work is good, they are a "good teacher"; as long as one's scores are high, they are a "good student." After new students enrolled, Kuang Yaming specially convened a meeting for high-scoring students, extensively promoting individual struggle and fame-seeking bourgeois decadent thoughts. He absurdly said: "If you score 105, I will let you join the party. If I die, you can come to my grave and tell me." In his first class for new political science students, he promoted: "As long as you study hard, you will have profound knowledge," "Write a good article and you will be carried to the capital in a sedan chair. From then on, you will have wealth and honor." Look, isn't this openly promoting the feudal society's "Books contain golden houses"? Isn't this promoting "Study hard and become an official"? Kuang Yaming often told students: "Fame and profit are objectively existent," "Fame is fame, who doesn't want it?" This is completely in line with the reactionary thought of "If one does not seek personal gain, heaven will punish them."

Representatives of the bourgeoisie, in today's society, recruit and train successors in an attempt to achieve "peaceful evolution," often using "fame" and "success" as bait to undermine the fighting spirit of revolutionary youth, making them the social base for the restoration of capitalism in China.

Kuang Yaming also maliciously distorted the relationship between red and expert, saying: "Red is manifested in expertise," "The process of expertise is also the process of being red." "As long as young people have three parts red, they are revolutionaries and should spend seven parts or more of their time on studying expertise." "Therefore, it is designated by the leadership that certain comrades, within a certain period, should focus their main energy on expertise, which is still the unity of red and expert, not the separation of red and expert, and cannot be said to be only expert, not red." He called on students to bury their heads in books, saying that as long as they study, they will definitely have a "red hat" to wear in the future.

Chairman Mao has always taught us that politics is the commander, the soul. These teachings are the highest criterion and guiding direction for us to correctly understand and handle the relationship between red and expert. The set of bourgeois, revisionist black goods peddled by Kuang Yaming cannot withstand the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought. His so-called "red is manifested in expertise" actually means "expertise is red." Kuang Yaming played a trick of "stealing the beam and replacing the pillar," canceling out the red. Unveiling Kuang Yaming's disguise reveals that his statement is just a variant of the fallacy of "politics implemented in work."

As early as more than twenty years ago, Chairman Mao taught us youth: "How to judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard to use? What to use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, to see if they are willing and actually combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing and actually combine with workers and peasants are revolutionary, otherwise they are not revolutionary or counter-revolutionary." This clearly indicates that a young person, to be revolutionary, must throw themselves into the broad masses of workers and peasants, blend with them, and in the three great revolutionary struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, brave the storms, see the world, and grow through tempering, and absolutely cannot shut the door and bury their heads in books, isolating themselves from society.

However, the wolf in sheep's clothing Kuang Yaming vigorously opposed young students participating in the three great revolutionary practices and combining with the masses of workers and peasants, and advocated the so-called "intellectual education first." At one time, the school criticized the bourgeois educational thought of "intellectual education first." At that time, Kuang Yaming was not in the school, but after he returned to the school, he immediately flew into a rage, in addition to overturning the verdict of "intellectual education first" in large and small meetings, he also quickly took reactionary measures to weaken political and ideological work, compressing the time for students to participate in social movements and labor. Kuang Yaming also put on a show of "caring for the younger generation," proposing that young teachers should have four supports: first, "diligently study and practice," second, "guidance from a master," third, "collective help," fourth, "leadership arranges and inspects well." This "four supports" has some support from bourgeois "experts" and "scholars," some support from individual struggle, but lacks support from the party's leadership and lacks support from Mao Zedong Thought as the commander. Kuang Yaming also said in the lecturer's meeting that they should "each find an 'expert' and 'authority' as a goal to strive for, if there is none in the school, they can find one nationwide, if there is none in the country, there must be one in the world." In short, he wants young people to kneel before the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," become servants of the bourgeoisie, inherit the bourgeoisie's mantle, and prepare for the restoration of capitalism.

From the above facts, it can be clearly seen that the counter-revolutionary revisionist Kuang Yaming completely implements the revisionist educational line and fights with the proletariat for the next generation. Our struggle with Kuang Yaming is a life-and-death class struggle between restoration and anti-restoration. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the party's educational policy, and thoroughly uproot the revisionist roots of Kuang Yaming and his ilk.

    毛主席说：在思想上要有所进步，政治上也要有所进步，这就需要学习马克思主义，学习时事政治。没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。
    驳匡亚明的“智育第一”
    江苏文
    毛主席说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”匡亚明却搬出一套修正主义货色对抗毛泽东教育思想。他说：“衡量一个学生是不是进步，第一看他学得好不好”，“衡量一个教师是不是好教师，首先看他是不是勤勤恳恳地教书，对学生负责，有比较高的学术水平”。总之，不管政治思想如何，只要业务好就是“好教师”，只要分数高就是“好学生”。匡亚明在新生入学后，还曾特地召开高分数学生座谈会，大肆宣扬个人奋斗、成名成家的资产阶级腐朽思想。他十分荒谬地说：“你们要考到一百零五分，我就让你们入党，要是我死了，你们就到坟上来告诉我。”匡亚明在给政治系新生上第一堂课时，就宣扬：“你们只要苦读，就会有高深的学问”，“写出一篇好文章”就可以“一顶小轿子抬到京城去。从此你也就荣华富贵了”。看，这不就是公开推行封建社会的“书中自有黄金屋”吗？不就是宣扬“学而优则仕”吗？匡亚明还经常对学生讲：“名和利是客观存在”，“名字就是名，那个不要名呢？”这和旧社会“人不为己，天诛地灭”这一反动思想完全是一路货色。
    资产阶级代表人物，在今天为自己招兵买马，培养接班人，妄图实现“和平演变”，常用成“名”成“家”做钓饵，瓦解革命青年的斗志，使之成为他们在中国复辟资本主义的社会基础。
    匡亚明还别有用心地歪曲红专关系，说：“红表现在专上”，“专的过程也就是红的过程。”“青年人只要有三分红就是革命者了，应当把七分或者更多的时间放在钻研业务上。”“因此，由领导上指定一定同志，在一定时期里将主要精力放到专上，这仍然是红专统一，而不是红专分割，也不能说是只专不红。”他号召学生要埋头读书，说什么只要读书，将来定会有顶“红帽子”戴上。
    毛主席历来教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂。这些教导，就是我们正确认识和处理红专关系的最高准则和指导方向。匡亚明贩卖的那一套资产阶级、修正主义黑货，是见不得毛泽东思想这个伟大真理的阳光的。他的所谓“红表现在专上”，实际含义是“专就是红”。匡亚明耍了一个“偷梁换柱”的花招，把红取消了。揭开匡亚明的画皮，就暴露出他这种说法不过是“政治落实到业务”的谬论的变种。
    早在二十多年前，毛主席就教导我们青年说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”这就清楚地指明了，一个青年，要革命，就必须投身到广大的工农群众中去，和他们打成一片，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命中，经风雨，见世面，锻炼成长，而决不能关起门来埋头读书，与社会隔绝。
    但是，狼子野心的匡亚明，却竭力反对青年学生参加三大革命实践、与工农群众相结合，而提倡所谓“智育第一”。有一个时期，学校里批判了“智育第一”的资产阶级教育思想。当时，匡亚明不在学校，可是他返校后，立即大发脾气，除了在大大小小的会上为“智育第一”翻案以外，还迅速采取了削弱政治思想工作的反动措施，压缩学生参加社会运动和劳动的时间。匡亚明还摆出一副“关心后辈”的姿态，提出青年教师要有四靠：一靠“踏踏实实地勤学苦练”，二靠“名师指导”，三靠“集体帮助”，四靠“领导善于安排检查”。这个“四靠”，有的是靠资产阶级“专家”、“学者”，有的是靠个人奋斗，唯独没有靠党的领导，没有靠毛泽东思想挂帅。匡亚明还在讲师座谈会上，要他们“每人找一个‘专家’、‘权威’作为奋斗的目标，校内没有，可以到全国去找，全国没有，世界上总是有的。”总之，他要青年拜倒在资产阶级“专家”、“权威”的脚下，做资产阶级的奴仆，接资产阶级的衣钵，准备复辟资本主义。
    从以上事实可以很清楚地看出反革命修正主义分子匡亚明，完全推行修正主义的教育路线，和无产阶级争夺下一代。我们和匡亚明的斗争，是一场复辟和反复辟的你死我活的阶级搏斗。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，彻底挖掉匡亚明之流的修正主义根子。
