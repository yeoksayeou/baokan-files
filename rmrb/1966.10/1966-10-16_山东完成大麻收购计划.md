Shandong Province has completed and exceeded this year's hemp procurement plan ahead of schedule. Currently, various hemp-producing production teams are still continuing to sell excess hemp to the state, striving to make greater contributions to socialist construction.

This year, the hemp-producing areas of Shandong suffered from a drought. The broad masses of community members actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, fighting against the drought with the revolutionary spirit of moving mountains, and ultimately achieved a bumper hemp harvest. After obtaining a good harvest, the people of the hemp-producing areas actively carried out harvesting, soaking, and processing activities, promptly selling the bumper hemp to the state.

    山东完成大麻收购计划
    山东省已经提前超额完成今年的大麻收购计划。目前，各产麻生产队还在把多余的大麻继续交售给国家，争取为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    今年，山东麻区遭受了旱灾，广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，以愚公移山的革命精神与干旱进行斗争，终于夺取了大麻丰收。麻区人民在获得好收成后，积极开展了收割、沤洗和剥制活动，及时把丰收的大麻卖给国家。
