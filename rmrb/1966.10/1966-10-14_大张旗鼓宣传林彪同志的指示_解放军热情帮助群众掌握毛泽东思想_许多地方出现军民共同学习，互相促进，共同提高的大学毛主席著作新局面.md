The People's Liberation Army, which regards the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought as its glorious duty, has in recent days, with great enthusiasm, stepped out of their camps, airports, docks, and border outposts to the surrounding areas of their stations, spreading Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The soldiers say, we must, together with the hundreds of millions of people across the country, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, truly grasp it, and turn the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

From the interior to the border regions, in the grand propaganda activities, the broad masses of officers and soldiers, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have traversed mountains and valleys, tirelessly spreading Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the broad masses of the people. The Beijing troops of a certain unit, which had previously organized a ten-thousand-strong propaganda team to arm the people of the Tangshan earthquake-stricken area with Mao Zedong Thought, recently organized 36 propaganda teams and film units. They turned Comrade Lin Biao's instructions into slides and once again deeply entered the Tangshan earthquake-stricken area to spread the great significance of Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the people. Many poor and lower-middle peasants were moved to say, when we suffered the earthquake disaster, you brought us the treasure of Mao Zedong Thought, helping us to stand tall and quickly restore our homes and achieve a bumper harvest; now that we are a bit complacent, you have timely brought us Comrade Lin Biao's instructions. Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are for the army, but they are also for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We firmly support them and will definitely follow them. In the past year, many units of the Wuhan troops have established more than a thousand Mao Zedong Thought study guidance stations in the surrounding rural areas of their stations. In recent days, these troops have sent out batches of guidance personnel to the guidance stations to spread Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the people. Some production team members, after listening, voluntarily requested to change the three guidance sessions in ten days to three guidance sessions in seven days. The team members said: among a thousand things, learning Chairman Mao's works is the top priority; among a thousand treasures, Mao Zedong Thought is the priceless treasure. The frontline military and civilian joint defense advanced unit, the 4th Company of a certain unit in Fujian, studied together with the militia at the joint defense outpost and held a military-civilian oath-taking rally in response to Comrade Lin Biao's call. They said: we will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, truly arm the coastal military and civilians with Mao Zedong Thought, and build the coastal defense line into an iron wall. Many officers and soldiers of the Guangzhou, Nanjing, Navy, and Air Force troops, while spreading Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the people, also extensively introduced their personal experiences in learning for the revolution, learning with class feelings, and working hard on the application of what they have learned.

Propagating to the masses, educating oneself. The broad masses of officers and soldiers have seized the opportunity to propagate to the masses, humbly learning from the advanced deeds and experiences of local activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, borrowing the local wind to push the army's mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The propaganda team of more than 500 activists in studying Chairman Mao's works from the Chengdu troops, while spreading Comrade Lin Biao's instructions in the countryside, held discussions with the community members on their learning experiences. Many units of the Lanzhou troops, while leading propaganda teams to spread Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the people, continuously invited the people's communes to introduce the advanced thoughts and deeds of activists in studying Chairman Mao's works. Large propaganda teams from the Kunming troops, while spreading the instructions in the border minority areas, learned from the revolutionary spirit of various ethnic groups in building a socialist border. Many units of the Jinan troops and the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet Military Districts have, while propagating, continuously visited the poor, asked the poor and lower-middle peasants to give reports, and enhanced their class feelings in studying Chairman Mao's works.

After the propaganda, many places across the country have seen a new situation where the military and civilians jointly study, mutually promote, and jointly improve in the great school of studying Chairman Mao's works.

    许多地方出现军民共同学习，互相促进，共同提高的大学毛主席著作新局面
    据新华社十三日讯　把宣传毛泽东思想作为自己光荣职责的人民解放军广大指战员，最近几天，欢欣鼓舞地走出营区、机场、码头和边防哨所，到驻地周围，向人民群众宣传林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的指示。战士们说，我们一定要和全国亿万人民一起，真正把毛泽东思想学到手，真正掌握起来，把全国变成毛泽东思想大学校。
    从内地到边疆，在声势浩大的宣传活动中，广大指战员满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，翻山越岭，不辞辛劳，把林彪同志的指示传达给广大人民群众。曾经组织万人宣传队，用毛泽东思想武装邢台地震地区人民的北京部队某部，最近组织了三十六个宣传队和电影组，把林彪同志的指示制成幻灯，再次深入邢台地震地区，向人民群众宣传林彪同志指示的重大意义。许多贫下中农感动地说，我们受到地震灾害的时候，你们送来了毛泽东思想这个法宝，帮我们硬起腰杆子，很快恢复了家园，夺得了丰收；目前我们有点满足的时候，你们又及时地送来了林彪同志的指示。林彪同志的指示是对解放军讲的，也是对我们贫下中农讲的，我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。武汉部队许多单位近一年来在驻地周围农村建立了一千多个学习毛主席著作辅导站。连日来，这些部队都派出大批辅导员到辅导站向人民群众宣传林彪同志的指示。有的生产队社员听了后，主动要求把十天辅导三次，改为七天辅导三次。社员们说：千件事，万件事，学习毛主席著作是头件事；千件宝，万件宝，毛泽东思想是无价宝。福建前线军民联防先进单位某部四连，在联防哨所同民兵们一起学习，并召开了军民响应林彪同志号召的誓师大会。他们说：林彪同志的指示，我们一定照办，真正用毛泽东思想武装海防军民，把海防线筑成铜墙铁壁。广州、南京和海军、空军等部队许多指战员，在向人民群众宣传林彪同志指示时，还用自己的亲身体会，广泛介绍了为革命而学、带着阶级感情学和在用字上狠下功夫等方面的经验。
    宣传群众，教育自己。广大指战员抓紧向群众宣传的时机，虚心地学习地方上学习毛主席著作积极分子的先进事迹和经验，借地方的东风，把部队学习毛主席著作群众运动推向一个新阶段。成都部队由五百多名学习毛主席著作积极分子组成的宣传队，在农村宣传林彪同志指示时，和社员们一起座谈学习体会。兰州部队许多单位领导干部在带领宣传队向群众宣传林彪同志指示的过程中，不断地请人民公社介绍学习毛主席著作积极分子的先进思想和先进事迹。昆明部队的大批宣传队，在边疆少数民族地区，边宣传边学习各族人民建设社会主义边疆的革命精神。济南部队和内蒙古、新疆、西藏军区许多单位的指战员在宣传中，还不断访贫问苦，请贫下中农作报告，提高自己学习毛主席著作的阶级感情。
    经过宣传，全国许多地方出现了军民共同学习，互相促进，共同提高的大学毛主席著作的新局面。
