A hardening oil factory with an annual production capacity of 3,000 tons has recently been completed and put into production in Wuhan. The workers of the Wuhan Chemical Factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have completed the construction of the factory in just five months, achieving the goals of speed, quality, and economy. Previously, Hubei Province was unable to produce hardening oil. The hardening oil needed for the production of soap and stearic acid had to be transported from locally produced vegetable oils to other cities for processing.

    武汉新建一座硬化油厂
    一座年产三千吨的硬化油厂，最近在武汉市建成并投入生产。武汉化工厂职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在短短五个月的时间内，就多快好省地完成了建厂任务。湖北过去不能生产硬化油。制造肥皂和硬脂酸所需的硬化油，靠把本省出产的植物油，远运到其他城市加工。
