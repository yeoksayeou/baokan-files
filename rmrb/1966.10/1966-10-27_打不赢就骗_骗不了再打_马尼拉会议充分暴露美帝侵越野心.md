When Unable to Win, Resort to Deception; When Deception Fails, Resort to Force:
The Manila Conference Fully Exposes U.S. Imperialism's Aggression Against Vietnam

The conference's communiqué plays tricks with "withdrawal," arrogantly demanding that the Vietnamese people lay down their arms and surrender.

New China News Agency, October 26th: Manila - At the moment when U.S. imperialism is in cahoots with the Soviet revisionist leadership, conspiring to pull off a dirty deal on the Vietnam issue, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson personally attended a meeting in the Philippine capital of Manila. He gathered his accomplices in the aggression against Vietnam—Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the two puppet regimes of South Vietnam and South Korea—to hold a so-called "Seven-Nation Summit" on the Vietnam issue from the 24th to the 25th.

This American president, who has suffered continuous defeats in South Vietnam and is at a loss for a solution, and who received "unprecedented encouragement" after a secret talk with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, demanded in the two-day secret Manila meeting that his six lackeys jointly serve the U.S. strategy of "forcing peace through war" and using "peace" propaganda to cover up the expansion of the war.

This meeting was a pure and simple war conference. Johnson, in the secret meeting, according to the logic of American aggressors, continued to blow the horn about the so-called "aggression" of North Vietnam against the South, shouting that U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in the aggression against Vietnam are "resolute" and their "determination will not waver," demanding that the Vietnamese people "change their attitude" and surrender to the American aggressors. The head of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland, even more brazenly shouted that the "Vietnam War is far from over" and that "the United States and its allies should send more troops to this country (South Vietnam)." According to Agence France-Presse, American experts at the meeting admitted that the "military potential" of the U.S. puppets in South Vietnam is "almost exhausted," while at the same time demanding that the participating accomplices "send the maximum possible aid, the sooner the better."

The joint communiqué adopted at the meeting, full of gunpowder, in accordance with the tune set by the United States, shouted that U.S. imperialism and its accomplices will not allow South Vietnam to be "conquered," meaning that the American aggressors want to stay put in South Vietnam. The communiqué also shouted that the "military efforts and all other efforts" of the United States and its accomplices must be continued, "as resolutely as needed and for as long as needed."

To cover up the U.S. imperialism's plot to expand the war and to play the trick of "forcing peace through war," the joint communiqué, while advocating the continuation of the "peace talks" plot, proposed a so-called "withdrawal proposal." Originally, U.S. imperialism itself is the aggressor, and the only way to solve the Vietnam problem is to withdraw the U.S. imperialist and its accomplice troops. However, this joint communiqué, turning black into white, proposed that in the event of "the other side withdrawing its troops to the North and stopping infiltration, thereby reducing the level of violence," the U.S. invading forces and their accomplice forces "will withdraw as soon as possible, not later than six months after the above conditions are met." This blatant blackmail and shameful deception is mainly aimed at promoting the "peace talks" plot, openly demanding that the Vietnamese people surrender to the American aggressors.

To continue the war of aggression against Vietnam and to occupy South Vietnam for a long time, the United States, at this meeting, following the pattern of the Honolulu meeting it orchestrated in February, concocted a set of military "pacification" plans to suppress the people of South Vietnam, political deception measures, as well as so-called social "progress" and "economic stability" plans. Even the Western press had to admit that the "comprehensive policy" in the conference communiqué could not cover up its purpose of expanding the war, and that "there was nothing new" except that.

This meeting also exposed the U.S. imperialism's plot to form a new anti-China alliance and its ambition to enslave the peoples of Asian countries for a long time. Johnson, in the secret meeting on the 24th, talked at length about the so-called "regional cooperation" issue, emphasizing the "need for a partnership" and advocating the "establishment of a new family." The so-called "Declaration on Peace and Progress in Asia and the Pacific Region" adopted at the meeting openly proposed that through so-called "economic, social, and cultural cooperation," it would "build this vast region of Asia and the Pacific, which has about one-third of the world's population, into a safe, orderly, and progressive region." In other words, it is to put the vast region of Asia and the Pacific, including China, completely under the slavery and control of U.S. imperialism. An article published in the U.S. Christian Science Monitor on the 24th admitted that the Manila meeting was a "unity," and the "long-term concern that brought the representatives together" was aimed at China.

Chairman Mao Zedong said: "U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. We must have a clear head, which includes not believing in the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of the threats of imperialism." U.S. imperialism has been using the two counter-revolutionary tactics of war and peace on the Vietnam issue, resorting to deception when unable to win, and resorting to force when deception fails. However, no matter what "peace talks" tricks U.S. imperialism plays or what new military adventures it plots, its ultimate failure is inevitable.

    打不赢就骗　骗不了再打
    马尼拉会议充分暴露美帝侵越野心
    会议公报玩弄“撤军”花招，狂妄地要越南人民放下武器投降
    新华社二十六日讯  马尼拉消息：正当美帝国主义同苏联修正主义领导集团打得火热、共谋在越南问题上大搞一场肮脏买卖的时刻，美国总统约翰逊亲自出马到菲律宾首府马尼拉，纠集它的侵越帮凶泰国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾和南越、南朝鲜两个傀儡政权，在二十四日到二十五日举行了讨论越南问题的所谓“七国首脑会议”。
    这个在南越连战皆败、苦无良策，而在同苏联外长葛罗米柯一场密谈之后受到“空前鼓舞”的美国总统，在两天的马尼拉秘密会议中，要他的六个仆从共同为美国“以战迫和”，和用“和平”广告掩盖扩大战争的新手法效劳。
    这次会议是一次不折不扣的战争会议。约翰逊在秘密会议上，按照美国侵略者的强盗逻辑，继续大吹所谓越南北方“侵略”南方的滥调，叫嚷美帝国主义及其侵越帮凶国家“是坚定的”，“决心是不会动摇的”，要越南人民“改变态度”，向美国侵略者妥协投降。侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰在会上更露骨地叫嚷“越南战争远没有结束”，“美国及其盟国应派遣更多的军队到这个国家（南越）来。”据法新社报道，参加会议的美国专家在会上一方面承认美伪在南越的“军事潜力几乎要枯竭了”，同时要求参加会议的帮凶“派出最大限度的援军，愈快愈好。”
    会议通过的一项充满火药味的联合公报中，按照美国定下的调子，叫嚷美帝国主义及其帮凶决不让南越被“征服”，就是说，美国侵略者要死赖在南越不走。公报还叫嚷要把美国及其帮凶的“军事努力和其他一切努力继续进行下去，需要多坚决就多坚决，需要多久就多久”。
    为了配合美帝国主义的“以战迫和”的花招，掩盖美帝国主义的扩大战争的阴谋，联合公报在鼓吹继续推行“和谈”阴谋时，提出了一项所谓“撤军建议”。本来美帝国主义自己是侵略者，解决越南问题的唯一途径应该是撤退美帝国主义及其帮凶的军队。可是这个联合公报却颠倒黑白地提出所谓在“另一方把它的军队撤退到北方、停止渗入，从而暴力程度消减时”，美国侵略军及其帮凶军“在上述条件实现后将尽快地不迟于六个月内撤走”。这种十足的讹诈，可耻的欺骗，目的主要是为了推行“诱和”阴谋，赤裸裸地要越南人民向美国侵略者投降。
    美帝国主义为了继续进行侵越战争和长期霸占南越，在这次会议上又仿照今年二月间它一手策划的檀香山会议的模子，炮制了一套镇压越南南方人民的军事“绥靖”计划、政治欺骗措施，以及所谓社会“进步”和“经济稳定”计划。连西方报界也不得不承认，会议公报的这“一大堆政策的综合”，掩盖不了它扩大战争的目的，除此之外“没有什么新东西”。
    这次会议还暴露了美帝国主义策划新的反华联盟，阴谋长期奴役亚洲各国人民的野心。约翰逊在二十四日的秘密会上大谈所谓“地区合作”问题，强调“需要伙伴关系”，鼓吹“建立一个新的大家庭”。会议通过的所谓《关于亚洲和太平洋地区的和平与进步问题的宣言》，明目张胆地提出要通过所谓“经济、社会和文化合作”，把“这个辽阔的、约有（世界）三分之二人口的亚洲和太平洋地区建成一个安全的、有秩序的和进步的地区”，换句话说，就是要把包括中国在内的亚洲和太平洋广大地区，完全置于美帝国主义的奴役和控制之下。美国《基督教科学箴言报》二十四日发表的一篇文章承认，马尼拉会议是一个“联合”，它的“把代表们集合在一起的长远关心的事情”就是针对中国的。
    毛泽东主席说：“美国帝国主义是外强中干的。我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”美帝国主义纸老虎在越南问题上一直是交替使用战“和”的反革命两手，打不赢就骗，骗不了再打。但是，不论美帝国主义玩弄什么“和谈”花招，策划什么新的军事冒险，它的最后失败是不可避免的。
