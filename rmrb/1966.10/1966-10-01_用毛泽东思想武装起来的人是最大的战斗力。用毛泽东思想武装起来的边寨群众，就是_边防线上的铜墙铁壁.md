Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. The border village masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the iron wall and copper wall on the border line.

As a border guard, one must not only defend the villages and hamlets on the border but also spread Mao Zedong Thought there. By arming the border village masses with Mao Zedong Thought, a true iron wall and copper wall can be built on the border.

Our company's defense area is inhabited by Dai people. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, one must learn the Dai language. Therefore, whenever I am with the Dai people, I actively engage in conversation with them. I ask about everything I see, learn a sentence, remember a sentence, and use a sentence. At night, I recite what I have learned in bed. After a period of study, I can explain Chairman Mao's works and the party's policies in the Dai language.

A political night school was established in Leiyun Village, with more than twenty young people participating. I served as the teacher there. The main content of the lessons was Chairman Mao's works, as well as some revolutionary hero stories and revolutionary songs. During the classes, I first talked about the history of suffering of the border people in the old society, then about the reactionary nature of the class enemy's exploitation and oppression of the people, and finally guided everyone to study relevant articles or discussions by Chairman Mao to raise their awareness and consciousness. The Dai youth studied very seriously. They all expressed that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, avenge their class brothers who died in the past, and fight for the defense of the southwestern gate of the motherland for life.

The masses had a strong desire to study Chairman Mao's works, but Chairman Mao's works were not available at the time. What should we do? I cut out some hard paper pieces, wrote Chairman Mao's quotations on them, and distributed them for everyone to study. These quotation boards were convenient to carry, and could be studied at night school and in the fields during the day.

Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority, one sentence is worth ten thousand. Once the Dai people learned Chairman Mao's instructions, they generated tremendous material force. The amateur propaganda team leader Enshuai, who originally did not work hard in the commune, established the idea of farming for the revolution through study, not only worked hard in the commune but also actively organized the propaganda team to sing the praises of socialism everywhere and propagate the bright future of border construction. Later, he was rated as an advanced producer. The teacher of the community-run primary school, Xiaojin, who originally did not work hard in teaching, learned from "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and realized that educating children is a major issue of cultivating revolutionary successors. She worked actively and seriously, educating the children very well, and the masses praised her as a good teacher. The accountant Moxiang, who had a physical illness, learned from Chairman Mao's works, took Zhang Side and Norman Bethune as examples, ignored his back pain, led the masses to plow the fields and sow seedlings, and worked actively in production. He was praised by the masses as the "good manager of Leiyun Commune." In the past, a few militia members were not very active in militia activities. After learning Chairman Mao's people's war theory, they realized that defending the national border is everyone's responsibility, and everyone should participate. They actively participated in various militia activities.

The growth of a new generation of Dai people made me see more clearly: those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force and the greatest productive force.

### 用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。用毛泽东思想武装起来的边寨群众，就是——边防线上的铜墙铁壁

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。用毛泽东思想武装起来的边寨群众，就是——
    边防线上的铜墙铁壁
    云南边防部队某部班长　蒋绍武
    一人红，红一点；全连红，红一连；防区红，红一片。作为一个边防战士，不仅要保卫好祖国边防线上的村村寨寨，还要在那里传播毛泽东思想。用毛泽东思想武装边寨群众，就能在边防线上，筑起一道真正的铜墙铁壁。
    我们连的防区都是傣族群众。要想向群众宣传毛泽东思想，就要学会傣族语言。因此，每逢和傣族群众在一起时，我就主动和他们攀谈。见什么，问什么，学一句，记一句，用一句，晚上睡在床上还要背诵一遍。经过一段时间的学习，我就能用傣语讲解毛主席著作和党的政策了。
    雷允寨子办了一所政治夜校，有二十多个青年参加，我在夜校担任教员。学习的主要内容是毛主席著作，同时也学习一些革命英雄故事和革命歌曲。讲课时，我先讲边疆人民在旧社会的血泪史，再讲阶级敌人剥削和压迫人民的反动本性，最后引导大家学习毛主席的有关文章或论述，提高认识，提高觉悟。傣族青年学得很认真。他们纷纷表示：一定要听毛主席的话，为过去的死难阶级兄弟报仇，为守好祖国的西南大门斗争一辈子。
    群众要求学习毛主席著作的愿望很强烈，可是，毛主席著作一时买不到。怎么办呢？我就剪些硬纸片，写上毛主席语录，发给大家学习。这种语录板携带方便，晚上在夜校学，白天可以带到田头学。
    毛主席的话威信最高，一句顶一万句。傣族群众一旦学了毛主席的指示，就产生了巨大物质力量。业余宣传队队长恩帅，原先不安心在社里劳动，通过学习，树立了为革命种田的思想，不仅安心在社里劳动，还积极组织宣传队，到处歌唱社会主义好，宣传边疆建设的远大前景。后来，被评为先进生产者。民办小学教师小金，以前不安心教学工作。学了《为人民服务》，她认识到：教育孩子是培养革命接班人的大问题，工作积极、认真，把孩子教育得很好，群众称她是好老师。会计莫相，身体有病，学了毛主席著作后，以张思德、白求恩为榜样，不顾腰疼，带领群众犁田撒秧，积极生产，被群众称为“雷允社的好管家人”。过去有少数联防队员对民兵活动不够积极，学了毛主席的人民战争思想，认识到：保卫祖国边防，人人有责，个个有份，就积极参加民兵的各种活动。
    一代傣家新人的成长，使我更清楚地看到：毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，最大的生产力。
