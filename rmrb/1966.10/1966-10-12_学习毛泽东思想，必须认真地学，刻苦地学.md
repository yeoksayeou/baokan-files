Comrade Lin Biao recently called on the People's Liberation Army to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. This directive is not only applicable to the entire army but is also extremely important and timely for the entire Party and the people of the whole country.

For many years, the People's Liberation Army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. In the areas of ideological and work revolutionization, it has achieved great successes and set a brilliant example for the people of the whole country.

In 1964, Comrade Mao Zedong issued a great call to the people of the whole country to learn from the People's Liberation Army. The people of the whole country, taking the People's Liberation Army as their example, strengthened political and ideological work and launched a vigorous mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In just a few years, numerous advanced units and individuals who actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works emerged on all fronts. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which smashes bourgeois ideology and establishes Mao Zedong Thought, has brought the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage throughout the Party and the country.

At present, we are in a new era of world revolution and a new stage of socialist revolution in our country. The situation of class struggle both domestically and internationally is changing rapidly. We must consciously and earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, master the powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, in order to adapt to the new situations and changes in class struggle and push the wheel of revolution forward.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: Mao Zedong Thought is the revolutionary science of the proletariat, the truth of the proletariat tested by long-term revolutionary struggles, the most practical Marxism-Leninism, and the unified program of action for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country.

The work on various fronts throughout the country is complex, and the situations are diverse. However, the point of unifying our thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought is common to all. If we grasp this one point of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasize politics, and revolutionize people's ideology, all work can be carried forward and done well.

In recent years, the People's Liberation Army has accumulated rich experience in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	(1) Study for the Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our comrades must understand that we study Marxism-Leninism not for show, nor because it has some mystery, but because it is the science that leads the proletarian revolutionary cause to victory." We study Chairman Mao's works for the same reason—to serve the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We must have the firm resolve to dedicate ourselves to the revolution, study Chairman Mao's works for life, and transform our ideology for life. We must regard studying Chairman Mao's works as our primary need in life. On this ideological foundation, everyone will have a high level of self-awareness in study, will exert effort, perseverance, and time, and will not be deterred by any obstacles or difficulties.

	(2) Study with Deep Proletarian Sentiments. Comrade Lin Biao said: "Mao Zedong Thought reflects the objective laws of class struggle both domestically and internationally and reflects the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people." Only by firmly standing on the proletarian standpoint, with deep proletarian sentiments, can we have boundless love, loyalty, and faith in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Only then can we deeply understand and effectively apply Chairman Mao's works, and achieve the goal of "doing as Chairman Mao says."

	(3) Focus on Application. Comrade Lin Biao proposed: "Studying Chairman Mao's works should be done with problems in mind, applying them actively, combining study with application, learning what is urgently needed first, and seeing results immediately. This method of study is the method of combining theory with practice, and it is the most effective Marxist method of study tested by practice. We should combine the study of Chairman Mao's works with the current domestic and international class struggle situation, with the Party's policies, and with our own thoughts and work. We should use the 'arrow' of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the 'target' of various ideological and practical problems. We should especially focus on transforming the bourgeois worldview, eliminating private interests, and promoting proletarian ideology.

	(4) Study and Apply in Struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Studying Marxism is not only about learning from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the workers and peasants that one can truly learn." In sharp and complex class struggles, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, can help us see clearly, stand firmly, and withstand pressure, remaining unshaken by storms and thunder. At the same time, we can learn from both positive and negative experiences, gaining lessons and improving ourselves in the midst of great waves.

	(5) Study Key Articles Regularly and Fundamental Views Repeatedly. Comrade Lin Biao requires the troops to treat Chairman Mao's works as compulsory courses. "Whether officers or soldiers, they should select a few compulsory and most relevant articles to the current actual struggle to read deeply, understand the spirit, and solve the current problems of the troops." He also advocates combining actual practice with studying Chairman Mao's quotations and memorizing some revolutionary aphorisms. In this way, by repeatedly studying and applying, Chairman Mao's many fundamental views can gradually deepen and take root in people's minds.

	(6) Leaders Should Study First. The four sentences, "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," are not only for the soldiers but also, and primarily, for the leaders, especially the high-ranking leaders. How high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held and how well Chairman Mao's works are studied are the primary criteria for evaluating the quality of leaders. Now, many young people study Chairman Mao's works very well. If those in leadership positions do not study seriously, they will inevitably fall behind.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway is a great school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This revolution is extremely sharp, complex, and profound, impacting every corner of social life and deeply touching the souls of every individual. Over the past few months, the surging waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought have been, for the broad revolutionary masses and cadres, a class without classes and an exam without exams; it is a million times more profound than classroom teaching and a million times more rigorous than classroom exams.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to unify the thoughts of the people of the whole country with Mao Zedong Thought, to uproot the roots of revisionism, to prevent capitalist restoration, and to ensure that our country gradually transitions from socialism to communism—a hundred-year plan.

In the storms of struggle, batch after batch of brave new warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are rapidly growing. Mao Zedong Thought is further changing the entire social landscape and the spiritual outlook of the people. Our great motherland is shining with ten thousand rays of light under the universal illumination of Mao Zedong Thought.

Let the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country all earnestly and diligently study Chairman Mao's works, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and rapidly turn the whole country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

### 学习毛泽东思想，必须认真地学，刻苦地学

    学习毛泽东思想，必须认真地学，刻苦地学
    林彪同志最近号召人民解放军，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段。这个指示，不仅对全军，而且对全党、全国人民都完全适用，都极为重要，极为适时。
    多年以来，人民解放军高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在思想革命化和工作革命化等方面，都取得了伟大成就，为全国人民树立了光辉榜样。
    一九六四年，毛泽东同志向全国人民发出了大学解放军的伟大号召。全国人民以解放军为榜样，加强政治思想工作，开展了蓬蓬勃勃的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。短短几年中，各条战线上都涌现了许许多多活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位和先进人物。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，使全党全国活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新的局面。
    现在，我们正处在世界革命的一个新时代，处在我国社会主义革命的一个新阶段。国内外阶级斗争的情况正在急剧地变化。我们只有更加自觉地、认真地学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想这个强大的无产阶级思想武器，才能够适应阶级斗争的新情况、新变化，向前推进革命的车轮。
    林彪同志指出：毛泽东思想是无产阶级的革命科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的真理，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。
    全国各条战线的工作尽管很复杂，情况尽管千差万别，但是，用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想，这一点却是共同的。把活学活用毛主席著作这一条抓好了，突出了政治，人的思想革命化了，一切工作就都能带动起来，都能做好。
    这几年，解放军活学活用毛主席著作，积累了丰富的经验。
    （一）为革命而学。毛泽东同志说：“我们的同志必须明白，我们学马克思列宁主义不是为着好看，也不是因为它有什么神秘，只是因为它是领导无产阶级革命事业走向胜利的科学。”我们学习毛主席著作，同样地是为了中国革命和世界革命。我们必须抱有干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想的坚强决心，把学习毛主席著作当作自己生活的第一需要。在这个思想基础上，每个人就会有高度的学习自觉性，就会出干劲，出毅力，出时间，任何阻力挡不住，任何困难压不倒。
    （二）怀着深厚的无产阶级感情学。林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想，反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律，反映了无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益。”只有坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，才能对毛主席著作领会得深，运用得好，才能做到“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做”。
    （三）在用字上狠下功夫。林彪同志提出：“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫。”这种学习方法，是理论联系实际的方法，是经过实践检验的最有效的马克思主义的学习方法。我们要把学习毛主席著作，同当前国内外阶级斗争形势，同党的政策紧密结合起来，同自己的思想和工作紧密结合起来，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，来射各种思想问题和实际问题之“的”。要特别重视在改造资产阶级世界观上狠下功夫，破私立公，大灭资产阶级思想，大兴无产阶级思想。
    （四）在斗争中学，在斗争中用。毛泽东同志说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，真正掌握毛泽东思想，就能够看得清，站得稳，顶得住，“台风刮不动，霹雷轰不倒”。同时，还可以从正反两个方面受到教育，取得经验教训，使自己在大风大浪中得到锻炼和提高。
    （五）重点文章经常学，根本观点反复学。林彪同志要求部队，把毛主席著作当作必修课。“无论是干部和战士，都应该挑选几篇必修的和当前实际斗争联系最密切的文章去精读，领会精神实质，解决当前部队的现实问题。”他还提倡结合实际学习毛主席语录，背熟一些革命警句。这样，反复学习，反复运用，就可以使毛主席的许多根本观点，在人们头脑里逐步加深，逐步扎根。
    （六）干部学在前头。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，这四句话，不仅是对战士讲的，而且首先是对干部、尤其是对高级干部讲的。毛泽东思想红旗举得高不高，毛主席著作学得好不好，这是衡量干部优劣的首要标准。现在，大量的青年人对毛主席著作学得很好。担任干部职位的同志，如果不认真地学习，就必然会被抛到落后的地位。
    当前正在开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是一个活学活用毛主席著作的大学校。这场革命，极其尖锐，极其复杂，极其深刻，冲击着社会生活的每一个角落，深深地触动每一个人的灵魂。几个月来，在毛泽东思想旗帜下进行的无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛骇浪，对于广大革命群众和干部来说，是不上课的上课，不考试的考试；比学校里的上课深刻一万倍，比课堂里的考试过硬一万倍。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是用毛泽东思想统一全国人民思想的伟大革命，是挖掉修正主义根子，防止资本主义复辟，保证我国由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的百年大计。
    在斗争的风雨中，大批大批用毛泽东思想武装起来的英勇新战士正在迅速成长。毛泽东思想正在进一步地改变整个社会面貌和人们的精神面貌。我们伟大的祖国，正在毛泽东思想的阳光普照下发出万丈光芒。
    让我们全党全军和全国人民，都来认真地、刻苦地大学毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，把全国真正地、迅速地办成为毛泽东思想的大学校！
