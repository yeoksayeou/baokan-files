We have personally witnessed the birth of the Red Guards during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are a foreign theater troupe visiting China to perform, and we have received strong support from the Red Guards, which has ensured the success of our performances. During our interactions with the Red Guards, they have been very friendly and kind to us. The bourgeois reactionary press claims that the Red Guards are narrow-minded nationalists, which is completely slanderous. We believe that the Red Guards are imbued with internationalism. We see in the Red Guards a pure and lovable spirit of patriotism and unity with international friends. Our entire troupe loves the Red Guards.

	Kawahara Shichirō, Director of the Japanese Zenshinza Theater Troupe

The Red Guards are sweeping away all reactionary, decadent, and feudal influences, and are eliminating all outdated customs. I have never seen anything as inspiring as the activities of the Red Guards in my life.

	Karon Jumaire, Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association

The Red Guards dare to engage in a thorough struggle against decayed, reactionary old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and dare to challenge imperialism. This shows that Chinese youth are successfully undergoing the test of great storms and trials, and they will certainly become the successors of the proletarian revolution.

	Ortega, Member of the Mexican National Liberation Movement

The new generation of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is playing a vanguard role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are determined to carry the Chinese revolution through to the end.

The proletarian internationalism of the Red Guards is deep and sincere. The Red Guards have expressed their heartfelt and complete support for the young Marxist-Leninists in France who are fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and monopoly capitalism under difficult conditions. The third and fourth generations of China will all be red.

The Red Guard movement is a great example for young French Marxist-Leninists and all French Marxist-Leninists.

The activities of the Chinese Red Guards make the revisionists uneasy, because these young people are the shock troops of the cultural revolution. It is they who are the hope that capitalism will not be restored in China and that China will forever advance on the path of socialism and communism.

The Red Guards have set a brilliant example, inspiring and will continue to inspire the fighting youth of the world.

    红卫兵赞
    我们亲眼看到红卫兵是在文化大革命中诞生的。我们是一个外国剧团，来到中国访问演出，得到红卫兵的大力支持，使我们演出获得成功。在我们和红卫兵接触过程中，红卫兵对我们非常亲切友好。资产阶级反动报刊说红卫兵是狭隘民族主义，这完全是造谣诽谤。我们认为，红卫兵是具有国际主义精神的。我们从红卫兵身上看到他们这种热爱祖国、团结国际朋友的纯真可爱的精神，我们全团都喜爱红卫兵。
    日本前进座剧团团长　河原崎长十郎
    红卫兵正在荡涤一切反动、腐朽和封建的影响，横扫一切陈规陋习。我生平从来没有见过像红卫兵活动那么令人鼓舞的事情。
    亚非记协书记处书记　卡荣朱迈勒
    红卫兵敢于同腐朽的、反动的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯作彻底的斗争，敢于向帝国主义挑战，这就表明，中国青少年正在胜利地接受大风雨的考验，他们肯定会成为无产阶级革命接班人。
    墨西哥民族解放运动成员　奥尔特加
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国新的一代在无产阶级文化大革命中起着急先锋的作用，他们决心把中国革命进行到底。
    红卫兵的无产阶级国际主义的感情是深厚的和真诚的。红卫兵表示，衷心和完全支持来自巴黎公社的国家和正在困难的条件下为反对帝国主义、修正主义和垄断资本的政权而进行斗争的法国年轻的马克思列宁主义者。中国的第三代和第四代都将是红色的。
    红卫兵运动是法国年轻的马克思列宁主义者和全体法国马克思列宁主义者的伟大榜样。
    法国《新人道报》
    中国红卫兵的活动使修正主义者不安，因为这些青年是文化革命的突击队，正是他们，是使资本主义不能在中国复辟，使中国永远在社会主义、共产主义道路上前进的希望。
    红卫兵树立了光辉的榜样，现在和将来都在鼓舞着世界上战斗着的青年。
