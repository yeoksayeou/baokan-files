Chairman Mao cares for and trusts the masses the most. Who cares for and trusts the masses the most? Who is best at relying on the masses? It is our greatest leader, Chairman Mao. Who cares the most about the healthy growth of young people? It is our great teacher, Chairman Mao. Who cares the most about the liberation of the oppressed peoples? It is the leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

Dear Chairman Mao, under your nurturing sunlight and rain, we have grown up healthily. We have great aspirations and lofty ideals. We are not afraid of storms and rain, and we will forever march forward!

You respect the masses' pioneering spirit the most. Our great Red Commander, Chairman Mao, you care for the masses the most, trust the masses the most, respect the masses' pioneering spirit the most, and support the masses' revolutionary actions the most. You are always with us Red Guards, and we Red Guards are always by your side. With your care, trust, and support, we are fearless, daring to smash the old world, and daring to change the heavens and the earth!

Jiangxi Shangrao Normal School Red Guard

You are our guide. We came from the red old capital of Ruijin to the heart of the motherland, Beijing, with countless feelings and excitement. In the history of the Chinese people's revolution, from Ruijin to Beijing, what a difficult and long journey it has been! Wise and great leader Chairman Mao, you have always been our guide. Today, I want to swear to you: In the current class struggle storm, no matter how fierce the wind and waves, even if Mount Tai presses down, we will definitely follow you and revolutionize for life.

You forever lead us in revolution. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, it is you who turn the world upside down, plan far ahead, have a broad vision, fight in the south and north, and have a million brave soldiers in your heart, pushing the wheel of history forward.

Chairman Mao, you are the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the revolutionary people, who are truly worthy of the title. You are the Red Commander, and we are the Red Guards. We will always listen to your words, read your books, and always follow you in revolution.

You have greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat. Since ancient times, in class society, it has always been "oppression is justified" and "rebellion is a crime." In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters, based on Chairman Mao's famous saying "rebellion is justified," have turned the world upside down, shaken the world, greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat, and greatly dampened the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

Why do we Red Guards dare to rebel against the bourgeoisie and all the monsters and demons? It is because we have the support of Chairman Mao's profound saying.

You are always connected with the masses. Chairman Mao, you care for the masses the most, believe in the masses the most, and you are always connected with the broad masses. The masses trust you infinitely, and you also trust the masses infinitely. You have received us revolutionary students four times in your busy schedule, which is the greatest trust, support, and encouragement for the revolutionary masses.
