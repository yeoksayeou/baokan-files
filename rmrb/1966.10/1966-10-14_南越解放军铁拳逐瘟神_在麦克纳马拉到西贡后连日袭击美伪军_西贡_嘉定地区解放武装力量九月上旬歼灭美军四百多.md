The South Vietnamese Liberation Army's iron fist drives away the plague

In the days following McNamara's arrival in Saigon, the liberation forces have been continuously attacking the U.S. and puppet forces.

West of Saigon, in the Gia Dinh region, the liberation armed forces annihilated over four hundred American soldiers in early September.

Xinhua News Agency, October 12th: Saigon reports: In the past two days, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces have intensified their attacks on U.S. and puppet forces near Saigon, causing significant casualties and losses to the enemy.

According to reports from Western news agencies, on the day U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara arrived in Saigon (October 10th), the liberation armed forces launched an attack on an enemy vehicle concentration point in the suburbs of Saigon. They destroyed a sentry post, several buildings, and some vehicles, and wounded several U.S. and puppet soldiers.

On the morning of the 11th, the liberation armed forces seized an enemy outpost located about forty kilometers southwest of Saigon, killing and wounding many defenders. On the 12th, the liberation armed forces used hand grenades to attack American officers riding in a jeep in the suburbs of Saigon.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 12th: According to reports from the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, in early September, the liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region launched continuous offensive attacks against the enemy in the city and suburbs of Saigon and Gia Dinh, annihilating 844 enemy personnel, including 409 American invaders killed and wounded. They captured six enemy outposts and sentry points, and destroyed 55 enemy vehicles.

Recently, the liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region have also launched fierce attacks on enemy-occupied areas, conducting an average of four battles per day and annihilating many U.S. and puppet soldiers. The military and civilians in this region have also recently smashed the U.S. and puppet ruling institutions in many areas on the outskirts of Saigon, annihilating enemy soldiers and police in entire rows.

According to another report, the command of the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces recently decided to award a third-class Liberation Military Merit Medal to a unit of the liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region, in recognition of their achievement in sinking the U.S. "Barton Latch Victory" 10,000-ton military transport ship in the Long Do River in August this year.
