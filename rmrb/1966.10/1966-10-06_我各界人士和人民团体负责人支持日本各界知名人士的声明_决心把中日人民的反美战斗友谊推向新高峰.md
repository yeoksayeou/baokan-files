Chinese figures and leaders of people's organizations issued a statement on October 5 supporting the statement issued by 32 prominent Japanese figures on September 26, calling for the promotion of Sino-Japanese friendship. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On September 26, 1966, 32 prominent Japanese figures from various sectors issued a statement titled "At a Time of Internal and External Crises, Again Appeal to the Nation to Promote Sino-Japanese Friendship," expressing the determination of Japanese progressives to further develop Sino-Japanese friendship and strengthen the unity of the two peoples. We, representing the people of various sectors and mass organizations in China, warmly welcome and wholeheartedly support this statement.

Chairman Mao said, "Apart from the pro-American monopolistic capitalists and militaristic cliques, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." The Chinese and Japanese peoples are good friends. We should be friends from generation to generation. Sino-Japanese friendship concerns the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and the peace of Asia and the world. The Chinese people have consistently and resolutely supported the Japanese people's just struggle against American imperialism. The heroic struggle of the Japanese people is also a powerful support for the Chinese people. Over the years, the peoples of the two countries have united closely in the common struggle against American imperialism and forged a deep friendship. As your statement points out, the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Japanese peoples "have played an extremely great role in the peace of Asia and the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples in Asia."

At present, American imperialism is escalating its aggression in Vietnam, attempting to spread the war to the entire Indochina region and China. American imperialism is using Japan as an important military base for its aggression in Asia. American imperialism is colluding with Japanese reactionaries to revive Japanese militarism, trying to bind the Japanese people to its war chariot to serve its aggressive war.

The Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. The 700 million Chinese people are a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have made up their minds to bear the greatest national sacrifices to support the Vietnamese people in defeating American imperialism. Therefore, all genuine, and not hypocritical, forces in Japan that oppose American aggression in Vietnam will inevitably support the Chinese people's anti-imperialist revolutionary stance and will inevitably struggle to further strengthen the combat friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The statement by the 32 Japanese figures proves this indisputable truth.

American imperialism, the Japanese Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and its various old and new followers are extremely afraid of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and are doing everything they can to sabotage the friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries. The issuance of the statement by the 32 prominent Japanese figures is a blow to the reactionary forces that oppose Sino-Japanese friendship and a great encouragement to the Japanese people who advocate Sino-Japanese friendship. Of course, a small clique of reactionary forces will not stop their sabotage activities against Sino-Japanese friendship; on the contrary, they will intensify their sabotage activities. However, as the statement says, the Sino-Japanese friendship movement has already possessed the power to overcome any pressure and is an irresistible historical trend. Any attempts by American imperialism, the Japanese Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and its various old and new followers to instigate, sow discord, damage, or sabotage this relationship will be jointly resisted and opposed by the peoples of the two countries; the result of their conspiracy will only be to lift a stone to drop on their own feet.

The Chinese people must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and adhere to the policy of developing friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. Let us raise the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship even higher, strengthen the struggle against our common enemy, American imperialism, further develop friendly exchanges and cultural and economic exchanges between the two peoples, and strive to achieve the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival. Let us work together to push the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan in the struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs to a new height.

### 我各界人士和人民团体负责人支持日本各界知名人士的声明  决心把中日人民的反美战斗友谊推向新高峰

    我各界人士和人民团体负责人支持日本各界知名人士的声明
    决心把中日人民的反美战斗友谊推向新高峰
    本报讯　我国各界人士和人民团体负责人五日发表声明，支持日本各界三十二位知名人士九月二十六日发表的呼吁促进日中友好的声明，全文如下：
    一九六六年九月二十六日，三十二位日本各界知名人士发表了《在内外危机的时候，再次呼吁国民促进日中友好》的声明，表达了日本进步人士要求进一步发展中日友好，加强两国人民团结的决心。我们代表中国各界人士和各群众团体，对这一声明表示热烈欢迎和衷心支持。
    毛主席说：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友”。中国人民和日本人民是好朋友。我们两国人民要世世代代地友好下去。中日友好，关系到中日两国人民的根本利益，关系到亚洲和世界和平。中国人民一贯坚决支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。日本人民进行的英勇斗争，也是对中国人民的有力支持。多年来，我们两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，紧密地团结起来了，并且结成了深厚的战斗友谊。正像你们的声明所指出的，中日两国人民的友好团结，“对于亚洲和平以及亚洲一切被压迫民族的解放斗争，起了极其巨大的作用”。
    目前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，妄图把战火烧到整个印度支那和中国。美帝国主义把日本当作它在亚洲进行侵略战争的重要军事基地。美帝国主义正在加紧勾结日本反动派，复活日本军国主义，力图把日本人民拴在它的战车上，为其侵略战争服务。
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。中国七亿人民是越南人民的坚强后盾。中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中国人民下定了决心，准备承担最大的民族牺牲，支援越南人民战胜美帝国主义。因此，日本一切真正的、而不是虚伪的反对美帝侵略越南的力量，就必然会支持中国人民的反帝革命立场，必然会为进一步加强中日两国人民的战斗友谊而斗争。日本三十二位知名人士的声明，证明了这一无可辩驳的大道理。
    美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义和它的形形色色的新旧追随者，十分害怕中日两国人民的友好，千方百计地破坏中日两国人民的友好关系。三十二位日本各界知名人士声明的发表，是对敌视中日友好的反动势力的当头一棒，是对要求中日友好的日本人民的巨大鼓舞。当然，一小撮反动势力决不会从此袖起手来，不再干破坏中日友好的罪恶活动，相反的，他们必将变本加厉地进行破坏活动。但是，正像声明所说，中日友好运动已经具备了足以战胜任何压力的力量，是任何人也阻挡不了的强大的历史潮流。美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义和它的形形色色的新旧追随者的任何挑拨、离间、损害、破坏这种关系的阴谋活动，必将遭到中日两国人民的共同抵制和反对；他们进行这种阴谋活动的结果，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    中国人民一定要遵循毛主席的教导，坚持发展中日两国人民的友好方针。让我们更高地举起中日友好的旗帜，加强反对我们共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争，进一步开展两国人民的友好往来和文化、经济交流，争取实现第二届中日青年友好大联欢。让我们共同努力，把中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中结成的战斗友谊推向一个新的高峰。
