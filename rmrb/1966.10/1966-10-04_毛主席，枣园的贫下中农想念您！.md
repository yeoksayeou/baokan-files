On the seventeenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary students from the capital and all over the country, together with our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, spent the happiest moments. So many moving scenes, so many exciting events, will forever be remembered by the people. The following are excerpts from the reporter's on-the-spot reporting.

    Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Zao Yuan miss you!

    "Chairman Mao has arrived!"

    "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    Cheers erupted on Tiananmen. The workers and peasants representatives lined up on the west side of the Tiananmen City Tower were the first to see the great leader Chairman Mao, whom they had been longing for day and night. They applauded enthusiastically and shouted joyfully.

    Among the crowd, the one wiping his eyes was Zhang Buwen, the party branch secretary of Zao Yuan Village. He was too excited, and tears kept welling up. Zhang Buwen clearly remembered that one year on the fifteenth day of the first month, Chairman Mao received the lion dance troupe from Zao Yuan. At that time, he had seen Chairman Mao. Time flies so fast, twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye. Chairman Mao is in such good health! He said to himself, "I'll take this good news back to Zao Yuan and tell the villagers. This is what everyone has been looking forward to!"

    On September 24, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Zao Yuan received a notice to send someone to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations. The people of Zao Yuan were so happy! They immediately held a celebration meeting. Men, women, old, and young all gave instructions, asking Zhang Buwen to greet Chairman Mao. Someone picked fresh fruits and green beans to hand over to Chairman Mao.

    How could he bring so many gifts? After much consideration, apart from selecting a small box of fruits, he also brought a small bag of red beans for the old poor peasant Gao Tongyou, who had eaten with Chairman Mao back then; and a small bag of green beans for the former women's director Han Guying, because she knew that Chairman Mao liked to eat green bean porridge. The former administrative director Li Xingfa said, "Chairman Mao is from Hunan and loves to eat chili peppers," insisting on bringing a small packet of chili peppers. As for Zhang Buwen himself, he brought two pounds of small millet. He thought that the golden yellow small millet from Yan'an symbolizes the glorious tradition of our party. Our party and army relied on "small millet and rifles" to defeat the Japanese devils and the reactionary Kuomintang, achieving the great victory of the Chinese revolution.

    Today, Zhang Buwen, carrying the deep affection of the people of Zao Yuan, came to Chairman Mao's side. There are so many words in his heart that he wants to say to the old man! In the past twenty years, Zao Yuan has changed, greatly changed! Today's Zao Yuan, from a distance, is shaded by green trees and orchards; up close, there are herds of cattle and sheep, and donkeys and horses fill the pens. Every household is well-fed and clothed. This change is because we listened to Chairman Mao's words and firmly followed the path of agricultural collectivization.

    Chairman Mao! The people of Zao Yuan still remember you writing many brilliant articles under the lamplight in the cave dwellings. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zao Yuan today read your books and feel especially close. Although you are far away in Beijing, we still feel as if we are by your side. Every day, when we go to work and pass by the platform where you gave the famous speech "In Memory of Norman Bethune," we think about whether we have done it "completely" and "thoroughly."

    "Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Zao Yuan miss you!" When Chairman Mao walked past the workers and peasants representatives, Zhang Buwen excitedly expressed his heartfelt words.

### 毛主席，枣园的贫下中农想念您！

    在中华人民共和国成立十七周年这个光辉的日子，首都和来自全国各地的工农兵代表、红卫兵和革命师生们，同我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席在一起度过了最幸福的时刻。多少感人的场面，多少激动人心的事情，将永远记在人们的心里。这是本报记者现场采写的几个片断。
    ——编者
    毛主席，枣园的贫下中农想念您！
    “毛主席来了！”
    “毛主席万岁！”
    天安门上，欢声四起。排列在天安门城楼西边的工农代表，首先见到了日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席。他们热烈地鼓掌，尽情地欢呼。
    人群中那个正在擦着眼睛的，是延安枣园大队的党支部书记张步文。他太激动了，热泪一次又一次地涌出来。张步文清楚地记得，有一年正月十五，毛主席接见枣园的秧歌队，那时他见过毛主席。时间多快呵，转眼二十年了。毛主席健康极了！他自言自语地说：“就把这个喜事带回枣园，告诉乡亲们吧，这是大家最盼望的事！”
    九月二十四日，枣园的贫下中农接到派人来北京参加国庆观礼的通知。枣园的人多么高兴呵！他们立即开了一个庆祝大会。男女老少千捎话万叮咛，要张步文向毛主席问好。有人摘下水果，拿出绿豆，要他转交给毛主席。
    怎么能带这么多礼物呢？再三考虑，除了挑选一小箱水果外，还为当年同毛主席一块吃过饭的老贫农高同有带一小袋红豇豆；为当年的妇女主任韩桂英带一小袋绿豆，因为她知道毛主席爱吃绿豆稀饭。当年的行政主任李兴发老汉说，毛主席是湖南人，最爱吃辣椒，坚持要带一小包辣椒来。张步文自己呢？带来了两斤小米。他想，金黄色的延安小米象征着我们党的光荣传统。我们的党和军队，就是靠“小米加步枪”，打败了日本鬼子和美蒋反动派，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利的。
    今天，张步文带着枣园人民的深情厚意来到毛主席的身边，有多少心里话要向他老人家说啊！二十年来，枣园变了，大变了！如今的枣园，远看绿树成荫，果树连片；近看牛羊成群、骡马满圈。家家户户丰衣足食。这变化，是因为听毛主席的话，坚定不移地走农业集体化的道路。
    毛主席呵！枣园人民还记得您在窑洞的灯光下，写下了许多光辉的文章。枣园的贫下中农，今天读您的书，特别感到亲切。虽然您远在北京，我们好像仍然在您的身边。每天出工，走过您当年发表著名讲演《为人民服务》的讲话台时，都要想一想自己是不是做到了“完全”和“彻底”。
    “毛主席啊，枣园的贫下中农想念您！”当毛主席走过工农代表身边时，张步文激动地说出了自己的心里话。
