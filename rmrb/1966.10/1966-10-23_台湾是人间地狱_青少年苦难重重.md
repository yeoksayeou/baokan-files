Under the rule of American imperialism and its lackey, the Chiang bandit clique, many young people in Taiwan are suffering severe abuse and living inhuman lives.

Humans Suffering Like Dogs

The *Taiwan News* recently reported the tragic fate of a young girl named Lin Jinbao, who was repeatedly sold and subjected to constant beatings, eventually ending up with a dog collar around her neck.

Lin Jinbao was abandoned by her mother at birth and spent her early years wandering, living a subhuman life. When she was seven, her mother, unable to endure any longer, reluctantly sent her to be adopted. A year later, this family sold her for 5,000 Taiwan dollars to a man named Wu in Kaohsiung City, who made her work in a "tea room" (a euphemism for a brothel) serving customers. When Lin Jinbao was nine, the owner sold her again for 5,000 Taiwan dollars to a man named Chen who ran a "coffee shop." The owner's wife, dissatisfied with Lin Jinbao's age, piled on heavy chores and frequently beat her, leaving her body bruised. Unable to bear it, Lin Jinbao ran away to the streets, sleeping under eaves at night. The woman owner caught her and, in a fit of madness, shaved her head, put a dog collar around her neck, and handcuffed her, imprisoning her like a criminal and beating her mercilessly, forcing her to do even heavier work.

The *Taiwan News* reported that Lin Jinbao is only twelve years old, but her young mind has already been severely damaged. "Her eyes stare straight ahead," the report said, "her expression is blank." Asked why she doesn't smile, she angrily replied, "Smile? Smile at what? I have never smiled."

A Thirteen-Year-Old Pedicab Driver

The *Taipei Trust News* reported that on a day in June, in the mountains between Yudalia Village and Fengshan Town in Kaohsiung County, a frail boy named Wang Taishun, hunchbacked and emaciated, was pedaling a tricycle with a fat woman and two children. Wang Taishun, starving, pedaled and pedaled, but halfway up the slope, he could go no further. The tricycle rolled down the slope, and Wang Taishun, desperate, jumped off and pushed it back up with all his might. He earned only six Taiwan dollars for his efforts, enough to buy only three pounds of cabbage in Taiwan.

Today, under the oppression of American imperialism and the dark rule of the Chiang bandit clique, a thirteen-year-old boy has to earn such blood money to support his family.

Wang Taishun's father is an old pedicab driver, drained of his strength by the Chiang clique, falling ill from overwork and bedridden. To support his family of six, Wang Taishun had no choice but to let his thirteen-year-old son pedal the tricycle to earn a living. Wang Taishun goes out early and returns late every day, seeking business. However, American soldiers and Nationalist Party officials and their wives all look down on his broken-down tricycle and small stature, refusing to ride with him. Wang Taishun toils day and night, shedding blood and sweat, but cannot even earn enough to feed his family of six, let alone pay for his father's medical treatment.

A Girl's Tears of Blood

According to Taiwanese newspapers, in a rundown house by the Tainan Canal, a girl is moaning in pain.

This girl is named He Man, twenty-four years old. After graduating from high school, she worked as a librarian at the "Recreation Library" of the American military base in Taiwan. One evening, He Man was on duty when an American soldier, Tux, came to "borrow" books. He took three books and tried to leave without signing, which angered him. That night, as He Man walked home to a dimly lit street corner, Tux suddenly grabbed her, choking her with his claws, pinning her to the ground, and then stomping on her legs and punching her head. He Man was severely injured and fainted on the spot. Later, she was found and sent to the hospital, remaining unconscious for two weeks.

He Man's eyes were the most severely injured, with a risk of blindness. She repeatedly demanded that the American military authorities punish the culprit and treat her injuries. However, the American military authorities, citing "no eyewitnesses" and "lack of sufficient evidence," let the culprit go free; not only did they not treat He Man's injuries, but they also forced her to work while sick. He Man's condition worsened, and she could no longer work the night shift. The American military authorities then dismissed her, leaving her without a livelihood, moaning in despair.

    台湾是人间地狱　青少年苦难重重
    在美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮统治下的台湾，许多青少年遭受着严重的摧残，过着非人的生活。
    人受狗罪
    《台湾新闻报》前不久，报道了台湾幼女林金宝，被人接二连三转卖，长期遭受毒打，最后被老板用狗圈套颈的悲惨遭遇。
    林金宝一生下来就随着被遗弃的母亲四处流浪，过着非人的生活。当她七岁的时候，母亲实在无法活下去，才忍痛把她送给人家做养女。一年以后，这一家以五千元台币，把她卖给高雄市一个姓吴的老板，让她在“金山茶室”（台湾的所谓“茶室”、“咖啡室”等都是变相的妓女院）里侍候人。林金宝长到九岁，老板又以五千元台币把她转卖给一家开“咖啡室”姓陈的老板。老板娘嫌她年纪小，不能“捧茶奉客”，便把繁重的杂活琐事全压到她头上，还动不动拳打脚踢，打得她遍体鳞伤。林金宝忍受不了，逃到街上不敢回去，夜晚就蜷缩在街头檐下睡觉。女老板把她抓回去，竟丧心病狂地把她的头发剃光，用套狗圈套住她的脖子，带上手铐，像犯人一样囚禁起来，任意毒打她，强逼她干更重的活。
    《台湾新闻报》说，林金宝今年仅十二岁，但在她幼小的心灵上已遭受到严重的摧残，“她两眼直视”，“表情呆板”，问她为什么不笑？她气愤地说：“笑？笑什么？我从来没有笑过。”
    十三岁的三轮车工
    台北《征信新闻报》报道，今年六月的一天，在高雄县由大寮乡影剧七村到凤山镇的山坡上，一个骨瘦如柴的少年王台顺，佝偻着腰，蹬着一辆三轮车，车上坐着一个肥猪似的胖太太，还有两个小孩。王台顺饥肠辘辘，蹬呀蹬呀，刚到半坡，再也蹬不动了。车子顺着坡势往下滑，王台顺不顾一切地跳下车，尽平生之力，把车子推上坡头。他流尽了血汗，得到的只是六元台币，在台湾只能买三斤白菜。
    今天在美帝国主义蹂躏和蒋匪帮黑暗统治下的台湾，年仅十三岁的少年就要赚这样的血汗钱，养家糊口。
    王台顺的父亲是一个老三轮车工人，被蒋帮榨干了骨髓，积劳成疾，卧床不起。为了一家六口的活命，他无奈何，只好忍痛让十三岁的长子去蹬三轮车，担负起维持家计的重担。王台顺每天早出晚归，招徕生意。可是，那些美国佬和国民党老爷太太们都嫌他车破人小，不愿坐他的车子。王台顺天天披星戴月，流血流汗，连一家六口人糊口的米钱也赚不回来，更不用说给父亲治病的医药费了。
    少女的血泪
    据台湾报纸报道，在台南运河畔的一间不避风的平房里，一个少女在痛苦地呻吟。
    这个少女叫何满，二十四岁，高中毕业后，到侵台美军机场的“康乐图书馆”当管理员。一天黄昏，何满值班，美国兵屠克斯来“借书”，抓了三本书就想走，她按规定要屠克斯签字，就为这事触怒了这个美国兽兵。这天晚上，何满回家走到街口灯光昏暗处，屠克斯突然出来把她抓住，用魔爪卡住她的脖子，把她捺倒在地，然后用脚踩住她的两腿，挥拳向她的头部猛击。何满被打得身受重伤，当场昏迷过去。后来被别人发觉，送进医院，两星期都处在昏迷状态中。
    何满受伤最重的是眼睛，有失明的危险。她再三向侵台美军当局提出，要求惩办凶手和给她治病。美军当局却以“没有目击证人”和“足资证明的物证”为理由，让凶手逍遥法外；不但不为何满治伤，还硬要她带病上班。何满伤势愈来愈重，不能再上夜班，美军当局竟借故把她踢出门外，使她丧失生计，在“绝望中呻吟”。
