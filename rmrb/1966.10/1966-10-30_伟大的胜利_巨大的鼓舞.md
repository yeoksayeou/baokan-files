The heroic members of the 3211 Drilling Team, who fought through fire and water, expressed their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao with great enthusiasm and celebrated the success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch. They said, "All our victories are attributed to our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and to the great Mao Zedong Thought."

Wang Youfa, a model worker of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, was extremely excited and said, "The success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the masses, can become a tremendous material force, capable of creating any miracle and overcoming any great difficulty. I firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently and ensure that Mao Zedong Thought is always in our minds, in our blood, and in our actions, contributing more to the socialist construction of our country."

Wang Cunyu, the deputy leader of the drilling team and a model worker of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, said, "This great victory will make the revolutionary people love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought even more, inspiring people to accelerate the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study the 'Three Articles' as our guiding principles, and work hard on mastering the use of words, ensuring that we truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought."

The heroes of the drilling team, Zhang Zhongmin, Ran Shurong, Peng Meifen, Fu Zhengjiang, Huang Chenghou, and Xu Yongmao, who are currently recuperating in the hospital, were overjoyed upon hearing the news. They immediately got out of bed and wrote an article collectively for the newspaper that night. They wrote: "Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. Once grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force and demonstrate immense power. They also expressed their determination to recover quickly, temper their thoughts to be even more red, and return to their posts as soon as possible to contribute more to the revolution."

The model workers of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Lei Hongbin, Peng Jiaji, and the worker's family member Mou Maoxiu, proudly said, "The success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and crushed the enemy's arrogance. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing and can create anything."
