To convenience the members in sending and receiving mail, my work has achieved fixed routes and points. Over time, the members have called me the "living clock."

I have been a mail carrier since 1958. Through continuous study of Chairman Mao's works, my sense of serving the people has become clearer, and my service work has become more effective.

After achieving direct delivery of mail and newspapers to each household, I used the standard of "complete" and "thorough" service to the people to examine my work. I asked myself, what else should I do for the people? What other requirements should I set for myself? I often saw many members, especially military dependents and Five Guarantees households, having to travel dozens of miles to send a letter, receive money, or pick up a package, which affected agricultural production. I thought, if I could handle these matters for them, wouldn't it save them time and allow them to focus on agricultural production? Isn't this contributing to the socialist revolution and socialist construction? From then on, I took on the responsibility of handling the mail, packages, and remittances for the "four types" and Five Guarantees households. Since 1962, I have ensured that Comrade Zhu, an elderly military dependent in Huangcun, has not had to go to the post office.

To let the members know the time I arrive at each village, making it convenient for them to send and receive mail, I also achieved fixed routes and points. Over time, the members often said, "Old Li is here, it's time to cook." "Old Li is here, it's time to go to the fields." The members have called me the "living clock."

    社员都叫我“活钟表”
    菏泽县投递员　李振芳
    我从一九五八年开始做投递员。经过不断的学习毛主席著作，我为人民服务的思想越来越明确，服务工作的路子，也越走越宽了。
    我在做到了邮件、报刊直接投到户以后，又用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的标准，检查了自己的工作。看一看，我还应该为群众办哪些事情？想一想，还应当对自己提出些什么要求？我经常看到有很多社员，特别是军工烈属和五保户，为寄一封信、领一次款或取一次包裹，要跑几十里路，影响农业生产。我想，如果这些事我都给办了，不就能为他们节省些时间，让他们集中精力搞好农业生产吗？这不就是为社会主义革命和社会主义建设尽了自己的一份力量吗？从此，我就把“四属”、“五保户”的信件、包裹和汇款包了下来。黄屯军属朱老大娘，从一九六二年起，我没让她跑过邮局。
    为了让社员群众知道我到达每个村庄的时间，便于交寄信件，我还做到了定班、定点。日子长了，社员们就常说：“老李来了，该做饭了。”“老李来了，该下地了。”社员们都叫我“活钟表”。
