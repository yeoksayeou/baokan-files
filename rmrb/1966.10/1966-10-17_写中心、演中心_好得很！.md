Chairman Mao teaches us that the Party's literary and artistic work "is to serve the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party in a certain revolutionary period." Chairman Mao's instructions are the compass and the steering wheel. We resolutely follow them. We, the Wulan Muqi, resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and do not listen to Zhou Yang's nonsense. For nine years, we have been deeply rooted in rural and pastoral areas, writing and performing the center, vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how much Zhou Yang and his gang oppose it, no matter how much the demons and monsters slander us, we continue to write, perform, sing, and draw. The masses love it more and more, and we are more enthusiastic about it. It is truly excellent!

Writing and performing the center means vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought, actively reflecting the socialist revolution and construction, and firmly believing in and promoting the Party's various policies and guidelines.

Our Wulan Muqi performance team has always tightly integrated itself with the revolutionary machine, moving in accordance with the revolution's momentum. When Chairman Mao called on us not to forget class struggle, we sang "Five Things Not to Forget" loudly and vigorously promoted the importance of remembering class and class struggle. When those demons and monsters cursed the people's communes as "ruined" and "established too early," we responded with passion and performed "The People's Commune is Good" and "The Old Couple Praises the Commune." In recent years, we have performed "Herder Loves Reading Chairman Mao's Books" and other programs to promote the masses' active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. These programs, which we compose and perform in response to the center, the farmers and herders want to see more and hear more. They are genuinely happy and fully support us. They enthusiastically praise us as the "Party's propaganda team." When asked for suggestions, they say: "Above all, promoting Chairman Mao's policies is the best." The words of the farmers and herders are the highest award for us. We must firmly establish this red foundation!

Writing and performing the center means being the vanguard of the literary and artistic front. As soon as the Party and Chairman Mao issue a call, we respond immediately, take the lead, and serve proletarian politics wholeheartedly. Whether Mao Zedong's instructions can be promptly and powerfully promoted among the workers, peasants, and soldiers is crucial to the success or failure of every revolutionary movement and central task. The workers, peasants, and soldiers regard Mao Zedong's instructions on various revolutionary movements as "timely rain." In every revolutionary stage and central task, Chairman Mao always timely guides the revolutionary masses in the right direction, accurately leading the revolution to victory. By writing and performing the center, we can quickly bring Mao Zedong's instructions to the masses, timely meeting the urgent needs of the farmers and herders. This is truly like sending timely rain in a drought or coal in the snow. As soon as we hear Chairman Mao's call, we immediately organize the masses to listen to broadcasts, read newspapers, and conduct oral propaganda; at the same time, we quickly compose programs, create lantern slides, and hold exhibitions. Thus, our propaganda becomes a trumpet, becomes a bullet, like lightning and thunder, quickly and effectively inspiring the masses and fiercely striking the enemy. Many party members, cadres, and herders who watched our short plays reflecting class struggle, such as "The 23rd of the 12th Month" and "An Unforgettable Night," immediately expressed their determination to firmly hold the printing press, tightly grasp the gun and the lasso, and fiercely fight against the enemy's politics, properly hold the revolutionary printing press, and defend the red mountains. An old herder who watched our performance of "Herder Loves Reading Chairman Mao's Books" read Chairman Mao's works late into the night. The old man said: "I suffered more than they did (referring to the characters in the play), I am older than them, I study Chairman Mao's books, I cannot fall behind them, I must catch up with them."

Writing and performing the center also helps us better study Chairman Mao's instructions, raise class consciousness and policy level, strengthen ideological remolding, and temper ourselves through labor. Without studying Chairman Mao's works, without deeply integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, without changing our stance and making our thoughts red, you will not be willing to write and perform the center, nor will you be able to write and perform well, expressing that fiery class sentiment. Only by studying Chairman Mao's works well and making our thoughts revolutionary can we correctly promote Mao Zedong Thought and speak to the hearts of the masses.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. Wherever Mao Zedong's instructions reach and are applied, revolution and production achieve victory. The members of Wushen Banner, following Chairman Mao's instructions, transformed the desertified grasslands into pastoral areas like Dazhai; when the people of Changtu listened to Chairman Mao's words, they exposed the sabotage plots of the demons and monsters. These victories, we wrote, performed, and sang about, ultimately praising the greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, through writing and performing the center, we deeply understand the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Each time we deeply enter the rural and pastoral areas to propagate, our understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions deepens, and our hearts become closer to the broad masses of farmers and herders. Many farmers and herders say: "Whatever we do, you do; whatever we think, you sing about." They also encourage us: "You do as Chairman Mao says, and you will be loved by the working people wherever you go!"

However, Zhou Yang and his gang oppose writing and performing the center, maliciously slandering writing and performing the center as "inappropriate demands," as walking a "narrow path," inciting writers not to write "things that match the center," rejecting "specific requirements," and even saying that "not matching is matching." This is pure nonsense! The creative performance and propaganda activities of Wulan Muqi, with large-scale writing and performing the center, are welcomed everywhere in rural and pastoral areas. The workers, peasants, and soldiers approve and support us, giving us a "pass" to gallop forward on the broad road of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This "pass" is issued by millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and Zhou Yang cannot revoke it! Every member of our team writes and performs the center, and good programs are increasing. We self-compose and self-perform, making our propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought more extensive and profound; we match the three great revolutionary movements more closely and powerfully, and our revolutionary flames, Zhou Yang, no matter how you pour cold water, cannot be extinguished! For nine years, our practice of deeply entering rural and pastoral areas to write and perform the center has fully proven that writing and performing the center is a broad road!

Why does Zhou Yang and his gang fiercely oppose writing and performing the center? This is not surprising. Because the Party's central task is to use the great Mao Zedong Thought to unite and educate revolutionary people and to strike and eliminate class enemies. Class enemies are most afraid of using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolutionary masses' movements. Every time a revolutionary movement is carried out, class enemies are exposed and defeated, and the revolutionary cause advances a big step. As a spokesman for the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, Zhou Yang naturally fears the Party's central task and naturally does not allow us to write and perform the center.

In the past, some demons and monsters on the grasslands feared our Wulan Muqi writing and performing the center to death. They "suggested" that Wulan Muqi inherit the decadent culture of lama dancing and feudal eroticism, "suggested" that Wulan Muqi wear lama robes to perform so-called "traditional arts." Zhou Yang is the spokesman for this gang of demons and monsters. They attempt to blacken revolutionary literature and art, trying to pull us into their revisionist mud pit, to be tools for capitalist restoration, which is absolutely impossible. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must serve the revolutionary needs, serve the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, write and perform the center extensively, and enthusiastically promote the great Mao Zedong Thought, promoting it every day and everywhere, letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in the hearts of 700 million people and in the hearts of people all over the world!

### “写中心、演中心”好得很！

    “写中心、演中心”好得很！
    内蒙古自治区直属乌兰牧骑第一队
    毛主席教导我们：党的文艺工作，“是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的”。毛主席的指示，是指南针，是方向盘，我们坚决照办。我们乌兰牧骑，坚决听毛主席的话，不听周扬的鬼话。九年来，我们一直扎根在农村牧区，写中心，演中心，大力宣传毛泽东思想。不管周扬一伙怎么反对，不管牛鬼蛇神怎么诬蔑，我们照样写，照样演，照样唱，照样画，群众越看越欢迎，我们越干越起劲，真是好得很！
    写中心，演中心，就是要大力宣传毛泽东思想，就是要积极反映社会主义革命和建设，就是要对党的各项方针、政策坚信不疑，宣传上紧跟、合拍。
    我们乌兰牧骑演出队，一直把自己紧紧拧在革命的机器上，跟随着革命机器的转动而转动。当毛主席向我们发出千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召的时候，我们就大唱《五个不可忘记》，大力宣传千万不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争。当那些牛鬼蛇神大骂人民公社“办糟了”“办早了”的时候，我们针锋相对，满怀激情地编演了《人民公社好》、《老两口夸公社》。最近几年，我们大演特演《牧民爱读毛主席的书》等节目，促进群众活学活用毛主席的书。我们这些随编随演配合中心的节目，农牧民看了还要看，听了还想听。他们打心眼里高兴，举双手赞成。他们热情地称赞我们乌兰牧骑是“党的宣传队”。请他们提意见，他们说：“千条万条，宣传毛主席的政策好，这是头一条。”农牧民的话，是给我们的最高奖赏，我们一定要扎牢这个红根！
    写中心，演中心，就是要当文艺战线的尖兵。党和毛主席的号召一发出，我们就闻风而动，打头阵，冲在前，紧紧为无产阶级政治服务。能不能把毛主席的指示，尽快地、有力地宣传到工农兵群众中去，关系着每项革命运动和中心工作的成败。工农兵群众把毛主席对各项革命运动的指示比为“及时雨”，在每个革命阶段和中心工作中，毛主席总是那么及时地为革命群众指明了方向，把革命准确地引向胜利。我们写中心，演中心，就能最快地把毛主席的指示带到群众中去，及时满足农牧民的迫切要求，这才是“旱天送去及时雨”，“雪中送炭”。我们一听到毛主席的号召，就马上组织群众收听广播，阅读报纸，进行口头宣传；同时立即编节目，画幻灯，搞展览。这样，我们的宣传就变成了号角，变成了子弹，像闪电雷鸣一样，又快又好地鼓舞群众，又狠又猛地打击敌人。许多看过我们反映阶级斗争的短剧《腊月二十三》《难忘的一夜》的党员干部和农牧民，当时就表示决心，要掌稳印把子，握紧枪杆子和套马杆子，狠狠专敌人的政，好好掌革命的印，保卫红色的江山。有位贫苦牧民老大爷，看了我们演出的《牧民爱读毛主席的书》，当晚回家读毛主席著作读到深夜。老人说：“我受苦比他们（指戏中人物）还深，我年纪比他们要大，我学毛主席的书，不能落在他们后边，要赶上他们。”
    写中心，演中心，也能帮助我们更好地学习毛主席的指示，提高阶级觉悟和政策水平，加强思想改造和劳动锻炼。不学习毛主席著作，不深入工农兵，立场不变，思想不红，你就不乐意写中心、演中心，也写不好，演不像，演不出那种火辣辣的阶级感情。学好毛主席著作，思想革命化了，才能正确地宣传毛泽东思想，才能说到群众的心坎上。
    毛泽东思想是我们各项工作的指导方针。毛主席的指示传到哪里，用到哪里，哪里的革命和生产就取得胜利。乌审召的社员按照毛主席的指示办事，就把沙化的草原改造成为牧区大寨；当铺地的群众听了毛主席的话，就揭穿了牛鬼蛇神的破坏阴谋。这些胜利，我们写了，演了，唱了，归根结底，都是为了歌颂毛泽东思想的无比伟大和正确。这样，我们在写中心、演中心的过程中，对毛泽东思想的伟大力量就体会得更加深刻。每深入农村牧区宣传一次，我们对毛主席的指示的体会就深一层，我们的心就和广大农牧民更贴近一步。好多农牧民说：“咱们干啥，你们就干啥，咱们想啥，你们就唱啥。”他们还这样鼓励我们：“你们照着毛主席说的做了，走遍天下，劳动人民都喜欢你们！”
    可是，周扬一伙却反对写中心、演中心，恶毒地诬蔑写中心、演中心是“不适当的要求”，是走“独木小桥”，煽动作家不写“配合中心的东西”，拒绝“某一个具体要求”，甚至说什么“不配合就是配合”，这纯粹是胡说八道！乌兰牧骑的创作演出宣传活动，大编大演中心，走遍农村牧区到处受欢迎，工农兵赞成，工农兵批准，给了我们在为工农兵服务的大道上快马加鞭、畅行无阻的“通行证”。这个“通行证”，是千千万万工农兵发给我们的，周扬你没收不了！我们队员人人写中心，人人演中心，好节目越来越多，自编自演越搞越红火。我们宣传毛泽东思想越来越广泛深入；我们配合三大革命运动越来越紧密有力，我们的革命烈火，周扬你怎么泼冷水，也扑不灭！九年来，我们深入农村牧区写中心、演中心的实践，充分证明了写中心、演中心是一条阳关大道！
    周扬一伙为什么这样疯狂反对写中心、演中心呢？这一点也不奇怪。因为我们党的中心工作，就是用伟大的毛泽东思想去团结和教育革命人民，去打击和消灭阶级敌人的。阶级敌人最怕用毛泽东思想去统帅革命的群众运动。革命运动每搞一次，阶级敌人就暴露一次，就被打倒一批，革命事业就向前推进一大步。作为地富反坏的代言人，周扬对党的中心工作当然害怕，当然不准我们写中心、演中心。
    过去，草原上的一些牛鬼蛇神，对我们乌兰牧骑写中心、演中心，害怕得要死。他们“建议”乌兰牧骑去继承喇嘛跳鬼、封建色情的腐朽文化，“建议”乌兰牧骑穿上喇嘛服装去搞什么“传统文艺”。周扬正是这伙牛鬼蛇神的代言人。他们妄想给革命文艺抹黑，企图把我们拉进他那个修正主义烂泥坑，去给资本主义复辟充当工具，这是绝对办不到的。革命的文艺工作者一定要服从革命的需要，服从工农兵的需要，大写大演中心，无限热情地宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，天天宣传，处处宣传，让毛泽东思想在七亿人民的心里扎下根，在全世界人民的心里扎下根！
