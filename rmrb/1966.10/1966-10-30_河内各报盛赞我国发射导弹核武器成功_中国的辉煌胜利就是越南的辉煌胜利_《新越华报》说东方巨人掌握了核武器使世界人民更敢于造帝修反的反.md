Hanoi newspapers have enthusiastically praised China's successful launch of missile nuclear weapons. China's glorious victory is Vietnam's glorious victory. The *New Vietnam Chinese News* says that the Eastern giant's possession of nuclear weapons makes the people of the world more daring in their resistance against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 29th: On the 29th, all Hanoi newspapers prominently featured on the front page the news of China's successful missile nuclear weapons test and published editorials to express their warm congratulations to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the fraternal Chinese people.

The editorial of the *People's Daily* said, "China is the rear base of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. China's glorious victory is also Vietnam's glorious victory. China's successful test of missile nuclear weapons is a tremendous boost to all our military and civilian personnel."

The editorial pointed out that China's great achievements in science and technology are a great victory for the socialist system in China, a great victory for the glorious Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao, and a great victory for the heroic Chinese people.

The editorial emphasized, "China's strength in all aspects is continuously growing, which is a crucial support for the people of all countries in their struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism. The stronger China's national defense becomes, the more secure peace in Asia and the world will be."

The editorial of the *Hanoi Capital Daily* said, "The miracle created by the Chinese people proves the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and proves the power of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 29th: On the 29th, the *New Vietnam Chinese News* published an editorial, enthusiastically hailing China's successful test of missile nuclear weapons and the new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The editorial said, "China's successful test of missile nuclear weapons is good news for the revolutionary people of the world and a victory report for those fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries." The editorial pointed out that at a time when imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are conspiring together to plot new and greater anti-China schemes, and when American imperialism is convening the Manila black meeting to prepare for the expansion of the war in Vietnam while collaborating with revisionism to plot the Munich conspiracy in the East, China successfully launched missile nuclear weapons, frightening the demons dancing wildly on the international stage and making the revolutionary people of the world applaud.

The editorial said, "Today, this Eastern giant possesses missile nuclear weapons, making the revolutionary people of the world even more spirited and confident, daring to resist imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and daring to overthrow imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries."

On the 29th, Huang Guoyue (standing second from the left), leading a delegation composed of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, visited the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam to warmly congratulate Ambassador Zhu Qiven (standing third from the left) on China's successful launch of missile nuclear weapons.
