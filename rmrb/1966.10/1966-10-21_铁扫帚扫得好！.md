The youth of Morogoro in Tanzania have smashed the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain and replaced it with a portrait of Tanzanian President Nyerere. This is a new development in the struggle of the Tanzanian people against imperialism and in defense of national independence. We warmly applaud: the revolutionary action of the Tanzanian youth is excellent!

Spiritual invasion has always been an extremely important front in imperialism's aggression. Imperialism, in the countries of Asia and Africa that have already gained independence, strives to instill and maintain its ideological influence, corrupting the national consciousness and fighting spirit of the people of various countries, in order to create and prepare the spiritual conditions for the implementation of neo-colonialism. The continued display of the portrait of the British queen in Tanzania serves this purpose.

Eliminating the ideological influence of imperialism is a very important task for the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa in establishing a new national culture.

Chairman Mao pointed out, "Imperialist culture 'is something that should be overthrown. If this is not overthrown, no new culture can be established. Without destruction, there can be no construction; without elimination, there can be no progress; without stopping, nothing can be achieved. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle.' The youth of Tanzania have taken up the iron broom to thoroughly sweep away the ideological influence of imperialism in Tanzania, thereby paving the way for the creation of their own new national culture.

    铁扫帚扫得好！
    坦桑尼亚莫罗戈罗市的青年，砸碎了英国女王伊丽莎白二世的像片，换上了坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔的像片。这是坦桑尼亚人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立斗争的一个新发展。我们热烈欢呼：坦桑尼亚青年的这个革命行动好得很！
    精神侵略从来都是帝国主义进行侵略的一条极为重要的战线。帝国主义对亚非已经取得独立的国家，竭力要灌输和保持它们的思想影响，腐蚀各国人民的民族意识和斗争意志，来为推行新殖民主义制造和准备精神条件。在坦桑尼亚继续悬挂英国女王的像片，其作用就在这里。
    肃清帝国主义的思想影响，是亚非新兴国家建立新的民族文化的一项十分重要的任务。
    毛主席指出，帝国主义文化“是应该被打倒的东西。不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”坦桑尼亚青年举起了铁扫帚，要把帝国主义在坦桑尼亚的思想影响彻底扫除干净，这就为创造自己的新的民族文化开辟了道路。
