Like the countless heroes and models of the Mao Zedong era, Wei Fengying has an infinite love for Chairman Mao and for Mao Zedong Thought. She is a good worker of Chairman Mao, a living example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Wei Fengying's distinctive feature in studying Chairman Mao's works is her courage to carry out a revolution in the depths of her soul. For over a decade, she has persistently and unremittingly carried out self-reform, ensuring that Mao Zedong Thought takes root in her mind.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs reform, the exploiters need reform, and the laborers also need reform. The working class must, in the struggle against the class enemy and in the struggle against nature, reform the entire society, and at the same time reform itself."

Although Wei Fengying comes from a worker's family, she has never relaxed her self-reform. On the contrary, she has a firm grip on her self-reform and sets high standards for herself. In Wei Fengying's view, "there is no such thing as being naturally red." She says: "To become a thorough revolutionary, one must first attack the 'self.'"

The worldview of the proletariat, the communist worldview, is not spontaneously generated. It is formed in the practical struggle of social class conflicts, in the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in the continuous self-reform of one's thoughts. If one does not arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and reform oneself, even if one comes from the working class, one will not be able to withstand the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and, of course, will not be able to become a conscious revolutionary fighter of the proletariat. Therefore, self-reform is a matter of utmost importance for everyone.

Proletarian thought and bourgeois thought are irreconcilable; one must prevail over the other. One must fiercely and thoroughly fight against the enemy in one's thoughts, showing no mercy. Some people fail in their self-reform because they lack this fierce determination and adopt a liberal attitude towards their erroneous thoughts. In our self-reform, we should be like Wei Fengying, who does not overlook even the slightest erroneous thought that flashes through the mind but pursues it to the root, leaving no room for it in the mind.

Wei Fengying, in summarizing her experience in self-reform, says: "Everything changes. Advanced individuals are not static. Advanced individuals will always have shortcomings. If one does not strengthen self-reform and carries the slightest achievement as a burden, one will go from being advanced to backward." Wei Fengying's spiritual realm can reach new heights precisely because she can continuously revolutionize and reform her thoughts. We should be like Wei Fengying, treating self-reform as a lifelong task, never being satisfied, and never relaxing.

Wei Fengying's deeds once again vividly prove that revolutionary people, by using Mao Zedong Thought to reform their souls and truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, will have the highest level of awareness, the greatest courage, and the richest wisdom. Such people are invincible.

Let us all be like Wei Fengying, study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, carry out thorough revolutions, continuous revolutions, and eternal revolutions.

    灵魂深处闹革命
    ——向毛主席的好工人尉凤英学习
    同毛泽东时代的千千万万个英雄模范人物一样，尉凤英无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。她是毛主席的好工人，是活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样。
    尉凤英学习毛主席著作的最大特点，是勇于在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，十几年如一日，坚持不懈地进行思想改造，使毛泽东思想在自己的头脑中扎下根子。
    毛主席教导我们：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造，剥削者要改造，劳动者也要改造”，“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。”
    尉凤英虽然出身于工人家庭，但她决没有因此而放松自己的思想改造。相反，她对思想改造抓得很紧，对自己要求很严。在尉凤英看来，“‘自来红’是根本没有的事”。她说：“要成为彻底的革命者，首先要向‘我’字开火。”
    无产阶级的世界观，共产主义的世界观，不是自发产生的，而是在社会阶级斗争的实践中，在活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造自己思想的过程中，逐步形成的。如果不是用毛泽东思想武装自己，改造自己，即使出身于工人阶级，也经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀，当然也不可能成为自觉的无产阶级革命战士。因此，思想改造对任何人来说，都是头等重要的大事。
    无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想是势不两立的，有敌无我，有我无敌。对自己思想上的敌人，一定要狠狠地斗，彻底地斗，毫不留情。有些人在思想改造中打败仗，就是因为缺乏这种狠劲，对自己的错误思想抱着自由主义的态度。我们在思想改造上，应该像尉凤英那样，对于即使是在脑子里一闪而过的一点错误思想苗头，也不放过，而是穷追到底，挖它的老根，决不给它在头脑里留下任何地盘。
    尉凤英在总结自己改造思想的体会时说：“什么事情都是变化的，先进人物不是一成不变的。先进人物总会有缺点，如果不加强思想改造，把一点成绩当成包袱背起来，就会由先进变后进。”尉凤英的思想境界所以能从一个高度达到另一个新的高度，就是由于她能不断革命，不断改造自己的思想。我们要像尉凤英那样，把思想改造看成一辈子的事情，永远不要满足，永远不要放松。
    尉凤英的事迹再一次生动地证明，革命人民用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，把毛泽东思想真正掌握起来，就会有最高的觉悟，最大的勇敢，最丰富的智慧。这样的人民是天下无敌的。
    让我们每个人都像尉凤英那样，把毛主席著作学好用好，彻底革命，不断革命，永远革命。
