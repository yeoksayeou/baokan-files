We watched the color documentary films "Chairman Mao and the Million-Strong Cultural Revolution Army" and "Chairman Mao Meets the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students" with tears of excitement welling up in our eyes. When we first saw Chairman Mao in his military uniform, striding with vigorous steps on the screen, we immediately felt a great warmth surge through our entire bodies. This was not just watching a movie; we truly felt as if we were standing by Chairman Mao's side! We cheered and sang along with the revolutionary masses on the screen. Look, Chairman Mao is radiant and full of vitality. His health is our greatest happiness as revolutionaries. Look, Chairman Mao is waving at us, smiling at us, and we feel an endless source of strength! Look, Chairman Mao is dressed in a military uniform, wearing a red badge and red armband, just like us soldiers! We feel immense pride, immense happiness, and supreme honor! Our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao! We will forever be your good soldiers, loyal to you, loyal to the Party, loyal to the people. We will forever, forever keep your instructions in our minds, in our blood, and put them into action, truly becoming revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

All reactionaries fear nothing more than the people being armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In recent years, anti-Party and anti-socialist revisionists have been extremely hostile to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works. They restrict the publication of Chairman Mao's works, preventing us from studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to sever the flesh-and-blood ties between Chairman Mao and the workers and peasants! This is like a mad dog trying to bite the sun, a foolish dream! Chairman Mao's heart is forever with the revolutionary people. Chairman Mao trusts the people the most, cares for the people the most, and understands the people the most. At this crucial moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has repeatedly received Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country, striking fear into the hearts of the monsters and demons. With the revolutionary people united with Chairman Mao, we have limitless courage and boundless strength. We dare to climb mountains of blades and cross seas of fire, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

We revolutionary soldiers love Chairman Mao dearly, believe in, admire, and are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. We read Chairman Mao's books every day, listen to every word he says, and carry out his instructions resolutely. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, hold a gun in one hand and a pen in the other, and counterattack all enemies who dare to invade. We firmly support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, and together with the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary masses, we will thoroughly smash the old world and sweep away all harmful elements! Even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble, our red hearts will never change. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will be held high, passed down from generation to generation, so that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will forever, forever fly high across all of China and the world!

    永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席
    中国人民解放军空军某部五好战士  刘培豪
    我们看到彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》和《毛主席接见红卫兵和革命师生》的时候，激动得热泪盈眶。当我们第一眼看到毛主席穿着军装，迈着雄健的步伐在银幕上出现的时候，顿时觉得一股巨大的暖流传遍全身。这不是在看电影，我们是真的来到了毛主席身旁！我们和银幕上的革命群众一起欢呼，一同欢唱。看，毛主席神采奕奕，满面红光。他老人家身体这样健康，这是我们革命人民最大的幸福。看，毛主席在向我们招手，向我们微笑，我们浑身产生了无穷的力量！看，毛主席身穿军装，戴着红帽徽、红领章，和我们战士完全一样！我们感到无限骄傲、无限幸福、无上光荣！我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席！我们要永远做您的好战士，忠于您，忠于党，忠于人民；我们要永远地、永远地把您的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，使自己真正成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士。
    一切反动派最害怕的就是用毛泽东思想武装人民。几年来，反党反社会主义的修正主义分子对于我们广大工农兵学习毛主席著作十分仇视，他们限制出版毛主席著作，不让我们广大工农兵学习和掌握毛泽东思想，妄想割断毛主席和工农兵的血肉关系！这是恶狗想咬太阳，痴心梦想！毛主席的心永远和革命人民的心贴在一起，毛主席最信任人民，最关心人民，最了解人民。在这场无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，毛主席一次又一次地接见了全国各地的红卫兵和革命师生，使牛鬼蛇神胆战心惊。革命人民和毛主席在一起，就有了无限的勇气和无穷的力量，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    我们革命战士无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚于毛泽东思想。毛主席的书我们天天读，毛主席的话我们句句听，毛主席的指示我们坚决照办。我们要牢记毛主席的教导，永远不忘阶级斗争，一手拿枪，一手拿笔，反击一切胆敢来犯的敌人。我们坚决支持红卫兵的革命行动，与红卫兵和广大的革命群众一起，彻底砸毁旧世界，横扫一切害人虫！海枯石烂，我们的红心永不变。毛泽东思想红旗高举再高举，一代传一代，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远地、永远地在全中国、在全世界高高飘扬！
