The PLA Shenyang Military Region's active participants in the study of Chairman Mao's works enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, determined to lead the way in raising the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

	The PLA Shenyang Military Region's active participants in the study of Chairman Mao's works have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, expressing their determination to make every effort to truly master Mao Zedong Thought and to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the military to a new level.

	Recently, some active participants in the study of Chairman Mao's works in the Shenyang Military Region held a study session and discussion on Comrade Lin Biao's instructions. Many comrades mentioned that since implementing Comrade Lin Biao's five principles for emphasizing politics, the military's understanding of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has reached a new height. Broad masses of cadres and soldiers have deeply realized that whether or not to study Chairman Mao's works is not only related to personal progress and the construction of the unit, but also to the fate of the Party and the state, and to whether the Chinese revolution and the world revolution can be carried through to the end. Chen Jinyuan, the political instructor of the original Red Ninth Company, said, "Grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works is grasping the revolutionary long-term plan. Let Mao Zedong Thought be passed down for thousands of generations, so that the leadership of the Party and the state can be firmly in the hands of revolutionary comrades of the proletariat for thousands of generations, and the revolutionary base established by the older generation can remain unchanging for thousands of generations." Zhao Rong, the political commissar of a certain regiment, said, "Strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. These four sentences collectively express the boundless love and loyalty of all comrades in the military to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and also represent the new level reached by the military in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works this year."

	The comrades present believed that by focusing on the "application" of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the military's ideological revolutionization has continuously achieved new victories. Cao Huishen, the political instructor of a certain unit, said, "Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is about carrying out class struggle and uprooting the soil of 'peaceful evolution.' Each study session, each application, and each uprooting is a blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries." Many comrades have shifted from defending to attacking in transforming their worldview, from peripheral battles to decisive battles, and are carrying out a revolution deep in their souls. The comrades present said that many military party committees can go out and carry out the revolution, with the party committee collective undergoing revolutionization. Broad masses of cadres and soldiers can grasp their own active thoughts and consciously carry out the revolution. The military has seen a lively and vibrant situation where old comrades lead young comrades, young comrades inspire old comrades, superiors lead subordinates, subordinates inspire superiors, headquarters lead units, units inspire headquarters, cadres lead family members, and family members inspire cadres. These are very encouraging phenomena that have emerged in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works this year and are also signs that a new stage of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is approaching.

	Comrades excitedly discussed that a great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has arisen nationwide. Especially since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the study and application of Chairman Mao's works across the country have taken on a new situation. From villages to cities, everywhere you see is a red sea of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and everywhere you hear is the loud voice of reciting Chairman Mao's works. Men, women, old, and young are all studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This is an unprecedented great revolutionary situation, truly heart-stirring! In this situation, Comrade Lin Biao has timely pointed out the direction for our military. We must resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, further grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, and strive for a new situation and a new level.

	The comrades present unanimously expressed that they would see the situation clearly, recognize their responsibilities, lead by example in studying well, and focus on the "application." Comrades said that the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee pointed out: "Comrade Lin Biao called on the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong throughout the military, setting a brilliant example for the whole Party and the whole country." This is the greatest encouragement and the highest requirement for us. How well the military studies Chairman Mao's works has an impact on the people of the whole country and the whole world. We must make every effort to truly master, truly study, and truly apply Mao Zedong Thought, and not disappoint the Party and the people's expectations. Everyone pointed out that leaders must lead by example in studying and applying well. Leaders must, like leading troops into battle on the battlefield, take the lead in the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, first arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and then leading the troops to study well and build the troops well. Everyone expressed that they would humbly learn from the workers and peasants, take the new situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that has emerged nationwide as a driving force for the military's progress, and push the military's mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

    大学毛主席著作　大立毛泽东思想
    在灵魂深处闹革命
    沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子响应林彪同志号召决心带头把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动提高到新阶段
    本报讯　解放军沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子，热烈响应林彪同志的号召，表示一定尽最大努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，把部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段。
    最近，沈阳部队的部分学习毛主席著作积极分子，学习座谈了林彪同志的指示。许多同志谈到，自从贯彻林彪同志突出政治五项原则的指示以来，部队对活学活用毛主席著作的认识，达到了一个新的高度。广大干部战士深刻认识到，学不学毛主席著作，不仅关系到个人的进步和连队的建设，而且关系到党和国家的命运，关系到能不能把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。原红九连指导员陈金元说，抓学习毛主席著作就是抓革命的万年大计。让毛泽东思想千秋万代传下去，党和国家的领导才能千秋万代掌握在无产阶级革命家的手里，老一代打出来的革命江山才能千秋万代永不变色。某团政委赵容说，努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，积极宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，这四句话集中地表达了全军同志对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想的无限热爱，无限忠诚，也是今年部队活学活用毛主席著作达到的新水平。
    到会同志认为，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下了功夫，部队的思想革命化不断地取得了新胜利。某部指导员曹惠臣说，活学活用毛主席著作就是搞阶级斗争，挖“和平演变”的土壤。学一次，用一次，挖一次，就是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的一次打击。许多同志在改造世界观方面，已由过去打防御仗转到打进攻仗，由打外围仗转到打攻坚仗，在灵魂深处闹革命。到会同志说，不少部队党委能够走出门闹革命，党委班子集体搞革命化，广大连队干部战士能够自己抓自己的活思想，自觉革命。部队出现了老将带小将、小将促老将，上级带下级、下级促上级，机关带连队、连队促机关，干部带家属、家属促干部的生动活泼的局面。这些都是今年活学活用毛主席著作中出现的非常可喜的现象，也是预示着活学活用毛主席著作新阶段到来的标志。
    同志们十分兴奋地谈到，全国已经兴起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动。特别是开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，全国活学活用毛主席著作更出现了新的形势。从乡村到城市，到处看到的是《毛主席语录》的红色海洋，到处听到的是朗读毛主席著作的响亮声音，男女老少都在学毛主席著作，用毛主席著作，这是从来没有过的大好革命形势，真是太激动人心了！在这种形势下，林彪同志及时地给我们军队指出了前进的方向。我们一定要坚决贯彻林彪同志的指示，毛主席著作的学习，一定要进一步抓紧，更讲究落实，要出现新的局面，提高到新的水平。
    到会同志一致表示，要看清形势，认清责任，带头学好，狠抓用字。同志们说，党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“林彪同志号召人民解放军在全军展开学习毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，为全党全国树立了光辉的榜样。”这是对我们最大的鼓舞，也是最高的要求。军队学习毛主席著作搞得怎么样，对全国、全世界革命人民都有影响，我们一定要尽最大努力，把毛泽东思想真正掌握起来，真正学到，真正会用，决不辜负党和人民的期望。大家一致指出，领导带头学好用好，是使活学活用毛主席著作群众运动深入向前发展的关键。领导干部一定要像在战场上带领部队冲锋陷阵那样，在活学活用毛主席著作运动中打头阵，首先用毛泽东思想武装自己，才能领导部队学好，把部队建设好。大家表示，一定要虚心向工农群众学习，把全国出现的活学活用毛主席著作的新形势，当作促进部队前进的动力，把部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段。
