Hundreds of revolutionary teachers and students from other provinces, as well as Red Guards, held a get-together with representatives from various countries' youth and student delegations at the Nationalities Cultural Palace on October 3.

At the beginning of the get-together, the Red Guards and the foreign youth and students together read a quote from Chairman Mao: "All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world, be courageous, and dare to fight, defying difficulties, braving hardships, and advancing wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All monsters will be routed." They then sang "The East Is Red" together.

During the get-together, the Red Guards and the foreign youth and students had friendly conversations, exchanged greetings, signed each other's books, and sang revolutionary songs together, praising our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's Health Is the Happiness of the World's People

A female Red Guard asked a French youth friend, "Did you see our great leader Chairman Mao the day before yesterday?" The French youth friend replied, "I saw him. I was less than twenty meters away from Chairman Mao." The female Red Guard said, "Chairman Mao is in good health. Chairman Mao's health is the happiness of the Chinese people." The French youth friend immediately added, "It is also the happiness of the world's people." A Red Guard from Shandong took out his diary and asked the head of the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Revolutionary Movement Youth Delegation, Paul Madouba, to sign it. Paul Madouba took the pen and enthusiastically wrote, "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." A Japanese student, while signing for the Red Guards, wrote, "The youth of Japan and China are united by Mao Zedong Thought. Let us strive to be good students of Chairman Mao!"

Remember Chairman Mao's Words and Carry the Revolution Through to the End

A French youth friend, while signing for the Chinese youth at the get-together, wrote as his first words, "Long live Chairman Mao!" One French youth friend wrote while signing, "For the victory of the French and world revolution, we must learn well from you and study Chairman Mao's works together with you. The world belongs to us young revolutionaries. Chairman Mao said, we are the sun at eight or nine in the morning. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's words, struggle resolutely, and carry the revolution through to the end."

Mao Zedong Thought Is the Beacon for the Revolutionary People

A female miner from Bolivia received a very warm welcome from the Red Guards. She enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao, saying that Chairman Mao had brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon. By mastering this weapon in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you will surely uproot revisionism. She also said that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the revolutionary people of the world. We love Chairman Mao because Chairman Mao has never forgotten the people of the world.

Mao Zedong Thought Is the True Marxism-Leninism of Our Time

Many foreign youth friends spoke at the get-together, enthusiastically praising our great leader Chairman Mao. An African youth friend, Yusuf, said in his speech that African students are engaged in various struggles. To achieve victory in these struggles, the African people take Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle. He said that in our time, true Marxism-Leninism is Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has universal significance and is the most vibrant Marxism-Leninism. He raised high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly saying, "We are completely confident that we will be victorious because we have such a weapon. This weapon is more powerful than the atomic bomb. This weapon is Mao Zedong Thought." He finally shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese and African peoples! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

At the get-together, some foreign youth friends sang Chinese revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red," "The East Is Red," "I Am a Soldier," and others.

When the get-together ended, the Red Guards and the foreign youth friends held hands and sang "We Are Marching on the Great Road." As they parted, the hosts and guests raised high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

    世界属于我们年青的革命者
    ——来京外地革命师生和各国青年、学生联欢
    来北京的数百名外地革命师生、红卫兵小将，三日在民族文化宫和各国青年、学生代表团举行了联欢。
    联欢会开始的时候，红卫兵小将和各国青年、学生一起朗读毛主席的一段语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”接着，一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    在联欢会上，红卫兵小将和各国青年、学生亲切交谈，互祝友好，互相签字留念，还一齐读《毛主席语录》、唱革命歌曲，歌颂我们伟大的领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席的健康是世界人民的幸福
    一位女红卫兵亲切地问法国青年朋友说：“你前天见到我们伟大的领袖毛主席了吗？”法国青年朋友回答说：“见到了，我和毛主席相隔不到二十米”。女红卫兵说：“毛主席真健康。毛主席的健康，是我们中国人民的幸福。”法国青年朋友紧接着说：“也是世界人民的幸福。”一位从山东来的红卫兵拿出日记本请刚果（布）全国革命运动青年代表团团长马东巴·保罗签字。马东巴·保罗拿起笔热情地写道：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。”一位日本学生在为红卫兵签字时写道：“日中两国青年是以毛泽东思想联结在一起的，我们为成为毛主席的好学生而努力吧！”
    牢记毛主席的话，把革命进行到底
    法国青年朋友在联欢会上为中国青年签字时，第一句话就写：“毛主席万岁”。有一位法国青年朋友在签字时写道：“为了法国和世界革命的胜利，我们要很好地向你们学习，和你们一起学习毛主席著作。世界是属于我们年青的革命者。毛主席说，我们是早晨八、九点钟的太阳。我们应该很好地牢牢记住毛主席这句话，坚决斗争，把革命进行到底。”
    毛泽东思想是革命人民的指路明灯
    来自玻利维亚的女青年矿工，受到红卫兵小将的极其热烈的欢迎，她热烈地赞颂毛主席。她说，毛主席天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是强大的武器，你们在无产阶级文化大革命中掌握了这个武器，就一定能把修正主义的根子挖掉。她还说，毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的指路明灯，我们热爱毛主席，因为毛主席从来没有忘记过全世界人民。
    毛泽东思想是当代真正的马列主义
    许多外国青年朋友在联欢会上发表了讲话，热情称颂我们伟大领袖毛主席。非洲青年朋友尤素福在讲话中说，非洲学生正在进行各种斗争。为了取得斗争的胜利，非洲人民把毛泽东思想当作自己的行动指针。他说，在我们的时代，真正的马克思列宁主义，就是毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想具有普遍的意义，是最活的马克思列宁主义。他高高举起《毛主席语录》，激动地说，我们完全相信我们是能够胜利的，因为我们有这样一种武器，这种武器比原子弹的威力大得多，这种武器就是毛泽东思想。他最后用中国话高呼：“中国人民和非洲人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”
    在联欢会上，一些外国青年朋友演唱了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《我是一个兵》等中国革命歌曲。
    联欢会结束的时候，红卫兵小将和各国青年朋友手拉手唱着《我们走在大路上》，在临别的时候，宾主高举《毛主席语录》，欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
