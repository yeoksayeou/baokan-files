Title: Fully Support the Red Guards!

I, as a Japanese person, fully support the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards. I am convinced that China will build a socialist state through this Cultural Revolution. In Japan, this Cultural Revolution is being propagated as if it were some sort of bad deed. Some newspapers are now saying that China's Cultural Revolution is leading the country to international isolation and so on. No matter how badly they speak of it, I do not believe that the Cultural Revolution is a bad thing.

Japan is a capitalist country, where workers and farmers are being exploited by capitalists. At the same time, domestic prices are rising, and life is becoming more difficult day by day, with a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Young people are losing hope, and workers cannot discuss ideology in society. Japan is truly a country without freedom. When China completely and thoroughly eliminates exploitation, the phenomenon of exploitation in my country will become more serious, and the gap between the rich and the poor will also become more pronounced. What is justice? Where is equality? The Japanese people must not be intimidated by such malicious propaganda. Truth will surely prevail.

    全力支持红卫兵！
    我作为一个日本人，全力地支持中国红卫兵的革命行动。我确信，中国将通过这一场文化大革命建设社会主义国家。在日本国内，竟把这场文化革命宣传成为做了什么坏事似的。一些报纸现在都在说中国的文化革命使中国走上了国际孤立的状态等等。尽管他们说得多么坏，但我决不相信文化革命是坏事。
    日本是一个资本主义国家，工人和农民都被资本家剥削着，同时国内物价上涨，生活是一天比一天困难，贫富悬殊。年青人丧失了希望，工人在社会上不能谈论主义，在日本真是一个没有自由的国家。当中国将完全彻底消灭剥削的时候，在我国剥削的现象将日益严重，贫富之差也日益显著。什么叫做正义？平等究竟在哪里？日本人民决不能被恶劣的宣传所吓倒，真理必定会胜利的。
