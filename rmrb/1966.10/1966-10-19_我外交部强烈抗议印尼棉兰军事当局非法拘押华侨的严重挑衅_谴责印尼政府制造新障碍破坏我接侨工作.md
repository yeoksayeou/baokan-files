	China's Foreign Ministry strongly protests the serious provocation by the Indonesian military authorities in Medan for illegally detaining overseas Chinese. It condemns the Indonesian government for creating new obstacles and sabotaging China's work of receiving overseas Chinese.

	New China News Agency, October 18th: On October 18th, China's Foreign Ministry handed over a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China, strongly protesting to the Indonesian government over the serious incident of the Indonesian military authorities in Medan illegally detaining overseas Chinese.

	The note states: "On October 10, 1966, the Indonesian military authorities in Medan deliberately created a serious incident of persecuting overseas Chinese. In the afternoon at around 1:00 PM, Captain Achda Be of the Medan Military Sub-district led a group of soldiers to provoke the overseas Chinese who were gathered in the dormitory of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School. Immediately, the Medan military authorities dispatched a large number of troops to storm into the dormitory of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, arresting dozens of overseas Chinese victims, and forcibly detaining them in the Medan Military Sub-district Command, subjecting them to unreasonable interrogation and brutal beatings. Some of them were seriously injured. Despite the fact that these overseas Chinese victims staged a hunger strike to protest, and the representatives of all the victims sent to Medan repeatedly negotiated with the Medan military authorities, the Medan military authorities still continued to detain these overseas Chinese and refused to release them."

	The note states: "The Indonesian government implements an anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese policy, driving a large number of overseas Chinese from the Aceh region to Medan, forcing them to leave Indonesia. These overseas Chinese are already in a situation of homelessness and destitution. The Indonesian government not only fails to take responsibility for protecting their safety but also repeatedly deploys troops to persecute them. On September 13th, the Indonesian armed forces, in order to cover up the insults of American reporters to the victims, had previously opened fire and suppressed the victims. Now, the Medan military authorities are again provoking and insulting the victims, creating this serious incident of persecuting overseas Chinese. At a time when the Chinese government is dispatching ships to receive the victims, the Indonesian government is taking such actions, obviously intending to create new obstacles and sabotage the work of the Chinese government in receiving overseas Chinese. This cannot be ignored by the Chinese government."

	The note states: "The Chinese government demands that the Indonesian government immediately release the overseas Chinese illegally detained by the Medan military authorities, punish the perpetrators, apologize to the victims, take responsibility for treating the injured overseas Chinese, and immediately take measures to ensure the safety of overseas Chinese and prevent similar incidents from happening again. Otherwise, the Indonesian government must bear the serious consequences that arise from this."

    我外交部强烈抗议印尼棉兰军事当局非法拘押华侨的严重挑衅
    谴责印尼政府制造新障碍破坏我接侨工作
    新华社十八日讯　中国外交部十八日把一件照会交给印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，就印尼棉兰军事当局非法扣押华侨的严重事件，向印尼政府提出强烈的抗议。
    照会说：“一九六六年十月十日，印度尼西亚棉兰军事当局，有计划地制造了一次迫害华侨的严重事件。当日下午一时许，棉兰军支区阿赫达·贝上尉率领一批军人，向被集中在棉兰华侨中学宿舍的受害华侨进行挑衅，接着棉兰军事当局即出动大批军队，冲入棉兰华侨中学宿舍，逮捕了四、五十名受害华侨，将他们强行拘押在棉兰军支区司令部，并且进行无理审讯和残酷殴打，有的人受了重伤。尽管这些受害华侨进行了绝食斗争，表示抗议，被赶到棉兰的全体受害华侨，也派代表向棉兰军事当局一再进行交涉，但是，棉兰军事当局仍然将这些华侨继续扣押，拒绝释放。”
    照会说：“印度尼西亚政府推行反华排华政策，把大批华侨从亚齐地区驱赶到棉兰，强迫他们离开印度尼西亚。这些华侨已经陷于流离失所，生活无着的困境。印度尼西亚政府不但不负责保护他们的安全，反而一再出动军队对他们进行迫害。九月十三日，印度尼西亚武装部队为了掩护美国记者侮辱受害华侨，曾经对受害华侨开枪镇压。现在，棉兰军事当局又对受害华侨进行挑衅和侮辱，制造了这次迫害华侨的严重事件。正当中国政府派船接运受害华侨回国的时候，印度尼西亚政府采取这样的行动，显然是蓄意制造新的障碍，阻挠和破坏中国政府派船接侨。对此，中国政府不能不严加注意。”
    照会说：“中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府，立即释放被棉兰军事当局非法拘留的华侨，惩办肇事人，向受害者道歉，负责治疗受伤华侨，并立即采取措施保障华侨的安全，保证不再发生类似事件。否则，印度尼西亚政府必须承担由此而产生的严重后果。”
