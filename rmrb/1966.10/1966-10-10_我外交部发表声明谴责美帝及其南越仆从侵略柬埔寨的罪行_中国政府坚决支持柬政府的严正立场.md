China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement Condemning U.S. Imperialism and Its South Vietnamese Puppets' Aggression Against Cambodia
The Chinese Government Firmly Supports the Cambodian Government's Just Stance

Xinhua News Agency, October 9th: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on October 9th regarding the recent attacks by U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese puppets' helicopters on Cambodia's Kampong Cham province border outposts. The statement expresses that the Chinese government and people firmly support the stance articulated in the Cambodian Kingdom Government's statement on September 28th. The full text of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement is as follows:

Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
October 9, 1966

On September 28th, the Cambodian Kingdom Government issued a statement strongly protesting the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese puppets' helicopters attacking Cambodia's Kampong Cham province border outposts. It also called on peace-loving and justice-seeking countries to take necessary measures to stop the savage aggression by U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese puppets. The Chinese government and people firmly support the Cambodian Kingdom Government's just stance.

Since August of this year, U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese puppets have repeatedly invaded the territory of the Cambodian Kingdom, causing severe losses to the lives and property of Cambodian border residents. This is an act of military threat by U.S. imperialism against the Cambodian Kingdom while it is escalating its aggression in Vietnam; it is also a crime of aggression committed by the Johnson administration against the Cambodian people at a time when it claims to want to improve relations with Cambodia. The repeated incursions by U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese puppets into Cambodian territory once again expose the wolfish ambitions and ugly face of U.S. imperialism, which is determined to be an enemy of the peoples of Indochina.

China and Cambodia are close friendly neighbors. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Our common enemy is U.S. imperialism, and we are all on the same front. We need to unite and support each other." The Chinese government and people have always followed Chairman Mao's directive, standing firmly with the Cambodian people, and using all our strength to support the Cambodian people in their just struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its puppets, to defend national sovereignty, neutrality, and territorial integrity.

    我外交部发表声明谴责美帝及其南越仆从侵略柬埔寨的罪行
    中国政府坚决支持柬政府的严正立场
    新华社九日讯　中国外交部九日就美帝国主义及其南越仆从的直升飞机最近袭击柬埔寨桔井省边防哨所发表声明，表示中国政府和中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府在九月二十八日的声明中所阐明的严正立场。中国外交部的声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                                          一九六六年十月九日
    九月二十八日，柬埔寨王国政府发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义及其南越仆从的直升飞机袭击柬埔寨桔井省边防哨所的罪行，并且呼吁爱好和平和主持正义的国家采取必要措施，制止美帝国主义及其南越仆从这种野蛮的侵略行动。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的这一严正立场。
    今年八月以来，美帝国主义及其南越仆从不断地侵袭柬埔寨王国的领土，造成了柬埔寨边境和平居民生命财产的严重损失。这是美帝国主义在加紧扩大侵略越南战争的同时，对柬埔寨王国采取的军事威胁行动；也是约翰逊政府声称要同柬埔寨改善关系的时候，对柬埔寨人民犯下的侵略罪行。美帝国主义及其南越仆从连续侵犯柬埔寨边境的事件，再一次暴露了美帝国主义决心与印度支那各国人民为敌的狼子野心和狰狞面目。
    中国和柬埔寨是亲密友好的邻邦。毛泽东主席说：“我们共同的敌人是美帝国主义，我们大家都是站在一条战线上，大家需要互相团结，互相支持。”中国政府和中国人民一贯遵循毛主席的这一指示，坚决同柬埔寨人民站在一起，并且尽一切力量支援柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略，维护国家主权、中立和领土完整的正义斗争。
