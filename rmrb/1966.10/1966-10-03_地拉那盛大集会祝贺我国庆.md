People from various circles in the Albanian capital of Tirana held a grand rally at the Cultural Palace on the afternoon of the 29th to enthusiastically celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Albanian Party of Labour Central Committee member and Chairman of the Albanian-China Friendship Association, A. Kelaizi, delivered a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in socialist construction over the past 17 years vividly demonstrate the correctness of the line led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong.

Kelaizi said, "China today has become an indestructible revolutionary fortress and a steadfast defender of Marxist-Leninist unity in the international communist movement."

Kelaizi concluded by saying, "A fraternal and everlasting friendship binds the peoples of Albania and China together. This friendship was forged by the Albanian Party of Labour led by Enver Hoxha and the Chinese Communist Party led by Mao Zedong, born and developed in the struggle against common enemies, and is based on the immortal teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the lofty principles of proletarian internationalism."

Following this, Mu Lin, the head of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association delegation, spoke at the meeting. He said, "All the achievements of the Chinese people are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people, through long-term revolutionary struggle, deeply feel that Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time."

Mu Lin then enthusiastically praised the Albanian people for their heroic spirit in launching a revolutionary upsurge on all fronts under the inspiration of a series of revolutionary measures adopted by the Albanian Party of Labour. He praised the Albanian people for setting a brilliant example in the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and all the peoples of the world, and for their high principles and fearless revolutionary spirit in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

Kelaizi and Mu Lin's speeches were frequently interrupted by slogans such as "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Long live the People's Republic of China!" and thunderous applause. The meeting was filled with a fraternal and combative atmosphere of unity between the peoples of China and Albania from beginning to end.

    地拉那盛大集会祝贺我国庆
    据新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那各界人士二十九日下午在文化宫举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚中国友好协会主席阿·凯莱齐在大会上发表讲话。他指出，中华人民共和国十七年来在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就，生动地证明了由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党的路线的正确性。
    凯莱齐说，中国今天已经成了不可摧毁的革命堡垒、国际共产主义运动的马克思列宁主义团结的坚定的捍卫者。
    凯莱齐最后说，兄弟般的、永恒的友谊把阿中两国人民联系在一起。这种友谊是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党缔造起来的，是在反对共同敌人的斗争中诞生和发展起来的，是建立在马克思列宁主义的不朽学说和无产阶级国际主义崇高原则的基础上的。
    接着，中国阿尔巴尼亚友好协会代表团团长穆林在会上讲话。他说，中国人民所取得的一切成就，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。中国人民从长期的革命斗争实践中，深切地体会到，毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。
    穆林接着热情地赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所采取的一系列革命化措施的鼓舞下，以英雄的气概在各条战线上掀起的革命高潮，热情赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在国际无产阶级和全世界人民的革命事业中树立的光辉榜样以及他们在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中表现出的高度的原则性和大无畏的革命精神。
    凯莱齐和穆林的讲话不时被“恩维尔—毛泽东”“中华人民共和国万岁！”等口号和暴风雨般的掌声所打断。大会自始至终洋溢着中阿两国人民兄弟般的友谊和战斗团结的气氛。
