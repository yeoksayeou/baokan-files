Despite the increasingly vicious attacks and slanders by the Soviet revisionist leadership against the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Soviet people have an even greater love and admiration for the great Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

A teacher in Moscow said, "The world's revolutionary leader today is Mao Zedong." A young student in Georgia told a Chinese comrade, "Mao Zedong is the leader of the world revolution. His health is our happiness." A middle-aged person in Leningrad said, "Mao Zedong and Stalin are true Marxist-Leninists." An elderly female worker in Moscow said, "Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time."

The Soviet people enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought and love Chairman Mao's works. A Soviet person told a Chinese comrade, "Chairman Mao's works have great significance not only for the world revolutionary struggle but also for guiding work in all fields." A student in Moscow said, "Lenin led the October Revolution, and after his death, Stalin led the construction of socialism. Now, it is up to Mao Zedong. We must study Mao Zedong's works well."

Many Soviet people, despite the obstacles from the authorities, enthusiastically express their boundless admiration for the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Mao Zedong. Once, an old man in Moscow saw a Chinese comrade on Red Square and excitedly raised his thumb, shouting, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" When the police pulled him aside and scolded him, he continued to shout loudly, "Mao Zedong!" Then he stood firmly with the Chinese comrade and requested a photo to commemorate the moment. A Georgian said, "The Georgian people's hearts for Mao Zedong will never change. We place our hopes on the Chinese people!" An old man in Moscow said, "In the past, we shouted 'Long live Stalin! Long live Mao Zedong!' Now, even though we are not allowed to shout, we still shout in our hearts, forever shouting."

    苏修的恶毒诽谤改变不了人心所向
    苏联人民无限爱戴毛主席
    据新华社莫斯科电　尽管苏联修正主义领导集团，对中国共产党和毛主席进行越来越恶毒的攻击和诽谤，但是苏联人民对伟大的毛主席和毛泽东思想却更加热爱，更加敬仰。
    莫斯科一位教师说：“现在世界革命的导师是毛泽东。”格鲁吉亚一个青年学生向中国同志说：“毛泽东是世界革命的领袖，他的健康也就是我们的幸福。”列宁格勒的一个中年人说：“毛泽东和斯大林是真正的马克思列宁主义者。”莫斯科一位老年女工说：“毛泽东就是当代的列宁。”
    苏联人民热烈赞扬毛泽东思想和热爱毛主席著作。一个苏联人向中国同志说：“毛主席的著作不仅对世界革命斗争有伟大意义，对各行各业的工作都有指导意义。”莫斯科的一位学生说：“列宁领导了十月革命，他死后有斯大林领导建设社会主义。现在只有靠毛泽东了，要好好研究毛泽东著作。”
    许多苏联人民不顾当局的阻挠，热情地向中国同志表达他们对当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的无比敬爱的心情。有一次，一位老人在莫斯科红场见到中国同志，便兴奋地翘起大拇指欢呼“毛泽东！毛泽东！”当警察把他拉在一旁训斥时，他还是继续大声高呼“毛泽东！”随后又紧紧地同中国同志站在一起，要求拍照留念。一个格鲁吉亚人说：“格鲁吉亚人民对毛泽东的心永远不会变，我们把希望寄托在中国人民的身上！”莫斯科的一个老人说：“过去我们喊斯大林万岁！毛泽东万岁！现在虽然不让喊了，但我们心里仍在喊，永远在喊。”
