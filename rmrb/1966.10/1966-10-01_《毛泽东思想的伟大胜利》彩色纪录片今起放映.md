The color documentary film "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought" will start screening today.

	Cheering the Success of China's Three Nuclear Tests

	The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dare to tread paths where none have gone before and dare to scale peaks never reached. China has mastered nuclear weapons, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and striking a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 30th, the color documentary film "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought," which celebrates the success of China's three nuclear tests, has been completed by the August First Film Studio and will be screened in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities starting October 1st, with subsequent screenings across the country.

	This film truthfully records the scenes of China's three nuclear explosions: on October 16, 1964, at 15:00; on May 14, 1965, at 10:00; and on May 9, 1966, at 16:00. These world-shaking pieces of good news have made people ecstatic with joy. Amidst the cheers of "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" and "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!", the narrator, with a resolute and proud voice, recites to the audience: China's self-designed and self-manufactured atomic bomb is a complete success. China's first nuclear test surpassed the initial nuclear test levels of the United States, Britain, and France! From the successful explosion of China's first atomic bomb to conducting a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, it took only over a year. This leap-forward speed fully proves that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dare to tread paths where none have gone before and dare to scale peaks never reached.

	The success of China's three nuclear tests is the result of the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of workers, engineering and technical personnel, scientific researchers, and all relevant personnel, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as Comrade Zhou Enlai, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, pooling wisdom and strength, and working in close cooperation. The great achievements of China's three nuclear tests solemnly declare to the world: the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism have been thoroughly exposed! Their evil attempts to blockade and sabotage China's mastery of nuclear weapons have been thoroughly smashed! We possess the spiritual atomic bomb that the enemy cannot have, and we also have the material atomic bomb. We will definitely be able to defeat any aggressor.

	The victories of China's three nuclear tests are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, great victories of the General Line. They are songs of triumph for Mao Zedong Thought that resonate through the clouds. The film, with a wealth of facts, eloquently demonstrates: once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force, and any human miracle can be created.

	The film also introduces the scenes of the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, engineering and technical personnel, scientific researchers, and all relevant personnel participating in the nuclear tests, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and conducting intense training and test activities, especially their scenes of hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works: the entire test site is a large school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and everywhere is filled with a strong political atmosphere.

	The film also introduces the scenes of scientific research activities conducted at the test site. On-site, many materials were recorded, repeatedly proving that the power of our nuclear weapons is formidable. At the same time, it repeatedly proves that as long as serious protective measures are taken, nuclear weapons can be completely defended against. These scenes powerfully refute the nuclear blackmail of U.S. imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, which claim that atomic bombs "will destroy humanity and everything," completely exposing their lies.

	The film emphasizes that China, at any time and under any circumstances, will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will, as always, continue to work with all peace-loving peoples and countries around the world to firmly strive for the lofty goal of a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

	The success of China in mastering nuclear weapons greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and strikes a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Newspapers carrying congratulatory messages from many fraternal parties and friendly countries' government leaders, people's organizations, and prominent figures on the success of China's three nuclear tests flash across the screen one by one. In their telegrams, they enthusiastically cheer: The nuclear weapons in the hands of the Chinese people are nuclear weapons for defending world peace, nuclear weapons for encouraging the anti-U.S. struggle of the revolutionary people of the world! They are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought!

    欢呼我国三次核试验成功
    《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》彩色纪录片今起放映
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰中国掌握了核武器，大长世界革命人民的威风，大灭帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的气焰
    据新华社三十日讯　欢呼我国三次核试验成功的彩色纪录影片《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》，已经由八一电影制片厂摄制完成，将于十月一日在北京、上海、天津等城市上映，并将陆续在全国各地放映。
    这部影片真实地纪录了一九六四年十月十六日十五时，一九六五年五月十四日十时，一九六六年五月九日十六时，我国三次核爆炸试验的现场情景。这些轰动世界的大喜讯，使人们欢欣若狂。在“伟大的中国共产党万岁”、“伟大领袖毛主席万岁”的欢呼声中，解说员用刚毅、自豪的语气，向观众朗诵：我国自己设计、自己制造的原子弹，是完全成功的。我国第一次核试验，超过了美国、英国和法国初期核试验的水平！我国从第一颗原子弹的爆炸成功，到进行含有热核材料的核爆炸，仅仅用了一年多的时间。这种大跃进的速度，充分证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。
    我国三次核试验成功，是解放军指战员、广大工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员，在党中央，在我们伟大领袖毛主席和他亲密的战友林彪同志以及周恩来同志的正确领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，集中兵力打歼灭战，群策群力，大力协同的结果。我国三次核试验的伟大成就，庄严地向全世界宣告：美帝国主义、现代修正主义的核垄断、核讹诈彻底破产了！它们封锁、破坏我国人民掌握核武器的罪恶企图，被我们彻底粉碎了！我们拥有敌人不可能有的精神原子弹，我们也有了物质原子弹，我们一定能战胜任何侵略者。
    我国三次核试验的胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是总路线的伟大胜利，是一曲又一曲响彻云霄的毛泽东思想的凯歌。影片以大量的事实，雄辩地说明：战无不胜的毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。
    影片还介绍了参加核试验的解放军指战员、工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员，把毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针，进行紧张的训练和试验活动的情形，特别是他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的情景：整个试验场区，是一所活学活用毛主席著作的大学校，到处是一派浓浓的政治空气。
    影片还介绍了在试验场区进行科学研究活动的情况。在现场，摄下了许多资料，一再证明我们的核武器威力是强大的。同时也一再证明，只要认真进行防护，原子武器是完全可以防御的。这些镜头有力地粉碎了美帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义对革命人民的核讹诈，它们胡说什么原子弹“会毁灭人类，毁灭一切”，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    影片强调指出，中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。中国人民和中国政府将一如既往，继续同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家一道，坚定不移地为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而共同奋斗。
    中国人民成功地掌握了核武器，大大地长了世界革命人民的威风，灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的气焰。登载着许多兄弟党和友好国家的政府首脑、人民团体、知名人士祝贺我国三次核试验成功消息的报纸，一张张在银幕上映过。他们在贺电中热烈欢呼：中国人民手里的核武器，是保卫世界和平的核武器，是鼓舞世界革命人民反美斗争的核武器！是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
