Workers, peasants, and soldiers in the audience enthusiastically praised the amateur performances by workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said: "The performances are about our lives, and the words are ours. Every word and sentence resonates in our hearts." This is a new victory for Chairman Mao's line on literature and art.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, during this year's National Day celebrations, amateur cultural workers from the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as the main force of the Cultural Revolution, made their debut on the national stage in the capital for the first time. They sang enthusiastically in praise of our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, turning the stage into a platform for promoting Mao Zedong Thought, which stirred a strong response among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They enthusiastically praised the successful performances by the amateur cultural workers, calling it a new achievement in implementing Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, and a new victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Among the workers, peasants, and soldiers who watched the joint performance by amateur cultural workers from the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers, National Labor Model and famous sanitation worker Shi Chuanxiang was particularly moved. When he saw workers, peasants, and soldiers performing on stage, singing praises to the Communist Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the great Mao Zedong Thought, he laughed so hard that his mouth couldn't close, and his eyes welled up with tears of excitement. He excitedly said: "It's great to have workers, peasants, and soldiers on stage! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!"

Soldiers Wei Yingji and Chen Baokui from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, who had both been awarded twice for meritorious service, regarded the successful performance as a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line on literature and art represented by Zhou Yang. They said that Chairman Mao pointed out as early as twenty-six years ago: "Literature and art should serve the people, the workers, and the peasants, who make up more than ninety percent of the nation, and gradually become their literature and art." However, a small clique of power-holders in the literary and artistic circles who took the capitalist road, led by Zhou Yang, did everything they could to suppress the literary and artistic performances by workers, peasants, and soldiers, allowing a few bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" to control the stage, making the stage a mess, and preparing the ideological and public opinion ground for the restoration of capitalism. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao led us to strike down the power-holders in the literary and artistic circles who took the capitalist road, making them lose their prestige. The day has come for us workers, peasants, and soldiers to take the lead in literature and art and become the masters of culture. The era of bourgeois domination of the stage is gone forever.

In praising the performances by workers, peasants, and soldiers, many people quoted Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our demand is the unity of politics and art, of content and form, of revolutionary political content and the best possible artistic form." They enthusiastically praised the performances by amateur cultural workers from the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the best they had ever seen, and believed that only those who loved Chairman Mao dearly, who had lived among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, and who fought on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements could perform such warm and moving programs.

The program "Daqing Workers Report Victory," which depicted the Daqing people overcoming numerous difficulties to build a world-class oil field under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, stirred strong resonances among the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the audience. National Agricultural Labor Model and Party Branch Secretary of Huangtugang Brigade, Huangtugang People's Commune, Beijing, Yin Weichen, was moved to tears when he saw in the program an old worker holding a new oil product of world advanced level, reciting: "You have made the Chinese people proud, and brought glory to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!" He said, "These programs praise our great savior Chairman Mao, praise our lifeline Mao Zedong Thought, perform our deeds, and speak our words. Every word and sentence resonates in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The more we watch, the more we like it, and the more we listen, the more we are inspired. We would be happy to watch a thousand times and listen a million times!"

Many workers, peasants, and soldiers pointed out that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and Chairman Mao will forever be the reddest sun in our hearts. To sing praises to our great leader Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most glorious mission of all revolutionary literary and artistic workers. The programs performed by amateur cultural workers from the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers are excellent in every way, but ultimately, they are good in one way—they have performed the sincere feelings of the revolutionary masses' boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao.

The distinct political content of the performances by amateur cultural workers from the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers is combined with a relatively perfect artistic form. They completely start from the need to sing praises to Mao Zedong Thought and to portray the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, without being constrained or limited by the rules and frameworks of bourgeois dramatic art. They have boldly innovated and created in the art of performance.

During the joint performance by workers, peasants, and soldiers, a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations was recited: "You are a bourgeois artist, and you will not sing praises to the proletariat but to the bourgeoisie; you are a proletarian artist, and you will not sing praises to the bourgeoisie but to the proletariat and the working people: the two must be one or the other." In light of Chairman Mao's teachings, many spectators believed that workers, peasants, and soldiers are the most loyal, steadfast, and active executors and defenders of Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, and are good examples for professional literary and artistic workers to learn from. Former Volunteer Army First-Class Hero Zhang Jihui said: "How to treat Chairman Mao's line on literature and art is the dividing line between proletarian artists and bourgeois artists. To create a new socialist culture, we need workers, peasants, and soldiers. Workers, peasants, and soldiers must, as the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, take up the pen, step onto the stage, and use Mao Zedong Thought to break the old and establish the new, letting the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate and redden every literary and artistic front!"

    把舞台变成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地
    工农兵观众热情赞扬工农兵业余文艺演出。他们说：演的是我们的事，说的是我们的话，字字句句都唱到我们心窝里。这是毛主席文艺路线的新胜利。
    据新华社十一日讯　今年国庆期间，工农兵业余文艺战士以文化大革命主力军的姿态，第一次登上国庆节首都艺术舞台，纵情歌颂我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，把舞台变成宣传毛泽东思想的讲坛，在广大工农兵观众中激起了强烈的反响。他们热情赞扬业余文艺战士的成功演出，是贯彻执行毛主席文艺路线的新成果，是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    在观看工农兵业余文艺战士同台演出的工农兵观众中，全国劳动模范、著名的清洁工人时传祥特别激动。当他看到工农兵上台自己演自己，歌颂共产党，歌颂毛主席，歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想的时候，一会儿笑得合不拢嘴，一会儿激动得热泪盈眶。他兴奋地说：工农兵上台太好了，这真是毛泽东思想的一个大胜利！
    中国人民解放军驻京部队某部曾立过两次大功的魏应吉和五好战士陈保奎把演出的成功看作是对以周扬为代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线的沉重打击，是无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。他们说，毛主席早在二十六年前就指出：文化“应为全民族中百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众服务，并逐渐成为他们的文化。”但文艺界周扬等一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，千方百计地压制工农兵的文艺演出活动，让少数资产阶级的“专家”“权威”把持舞台，把舞台搞得乌烟瘴气，为复辟资本主义做思想上、舆论上的准备。在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席领导我们把文艺界走资本主义道路的当权派打得威风扫地。我们工农兵在文艺上出头、做文化的主人的日子到了，资产阶级统治舞台的时代一去不复返了。
    在评赞工农兵的演出时，许多人都引用了毛主席的这样一段教导：“我们的要求则是政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。”他们热烈赞扬工农兵业余文艺战士的演出是他们所看到的最好的演出，并且认为，只有无限热爱毛主席，只有长期生活在工农兵群众之中，只有战斗在三大革命第一线上的人，才能演出这样亲切动人的好节目。
    表现大庆人在光辉的毛泽东思想指导下克服重重困难建成世界第一流大油田的节目《大庆职工报捷》，在工农兵观众中激起了强烈的共鸣。全国农业劳动模范、北京市黄土岗人民公社黄土岗大队党总支书记殷维臣，看到节目中老工人捧着具有世界先进水平的石油新产品，朗诵道：“你，为中国人民争了气，为党中央、为毛主席增了光！”激动地流下了眼泪。他说，这些节目歌颂了我们的大救星毛主席，歌颂了我们的命根子毛泽东思想，演的是我们的事，说的是我们的话，字字句句都唱到我们贫下中农的心窝里，越看越爱看，越听越来劲，看一千遍、听一万次也乐意！
    许多工农兵观众指出，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛主席永远是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是一切革命文艺工作者最光荣的任务。工农兵业余文艺战士演出的节目，千好万好，归根到底是一好——把革命群众对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的真挚感情演出来了。
    工农兵业余文艺战士演出的鲜明的政治内容是和比较完美的艺术形式结合在一起的。他们完全从歌颂毛泽东思想和表现工农兵英雄人物的需要出发，丝毫不受资产阶级戏剧艺术那些清规戒律、框框套套的约束和限制，在表演艺术上进行了大胆的革新和创造。
    工农兵联合演出时朗诵了一段毛主席语录：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”对照毛主席的教导，许多观众都认为，工农兵是毛主席的文艺路线的最忠诚、最坚定、最积极的执行者和捍卫者，是专业文艺工作者学习的好榜样。前志愿军一级战斗英雄张积慧说：如何对待毛主席的文艺路线，是区别无产阶级文艺家和资产阶级文艺家的分水岭。创造社会主义新文化要靠工农兵。工农兵就是要以无产阶级文化大革命主力军的姿态，拿起笔杆，登上舞台，用毛泽东思想破旧立新，让毛泽东思想的光辉把一切文艺阵地都照亮、照红！
