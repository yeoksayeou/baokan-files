The Chinese Beijing Song and Dance Troupe held its first performance in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 17th, receiving a warm welcome. Nearly 2,000 people from various circles in Tokyo watched the troupe's excellent performance, armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Whenever a radiant portrait of Chairman Mao during the Long March appeared on stage, or a portrait of Chairman Mao wearing a Red Guard armband appeared, or when the performers sang "Mao Zedong Thought is the Sun That Never Sets" in Japanese, the audience burst into prolonged applause, expressing their boundless love and respect for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

This performance demonstrated the fighting unity between the peoples of China and Japan in their struggle against American imperialism. When the Chinese performers sang "The Anti-American Song Echoes Across the Land" in Japanese, the entire audience clapped in rhythm, blending the anti-American sentiments of the performers and the audience into one.

Throughout the nearly three-hour performance, the singing and applause on and off the stage blended into one.

At the end of the performance, the resounding song "Count on the Helmsman to Navigate the Seas" echoed throughout the venue.

    北京歌舞团在东京首次演出全场歌声掌声融成一片
    据新华社十八日讯  东京消息：中国北京歌舞团十七日下午在东京举行第一场演出，受到热烈欢迎。东京各界群众近两千人，观看了用毛泽东思想武装起来的北京歌舞团的精采演出。
    每当舞台上映出光芒四射的毛主席在长征时代的巨幅画像的时候，出现毛主席佩戴着红卫兵袖章的巨幅画像的时候，或者是当演员用日文唱出《毛泽东思想是不落的太阳》这首歌曲的时候，全场一再响起经久不息的掌声，表达了日本观众对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和无限崇敬。
    这次演出显示了日中两国人民在反美斗争中的战斗团结。当中国演员用日文演唱起《反美歌声响彻大地》这首歌曲时，全场观众有节奏地拍起手来，演员和观众的反美情感融合在一起。
    在将近三小时的演出中，台上台下的歌声和掌声一再融成一片。
    演出结束时，《大海航行靠舵手》的嘹亮歌声震荡全场。
