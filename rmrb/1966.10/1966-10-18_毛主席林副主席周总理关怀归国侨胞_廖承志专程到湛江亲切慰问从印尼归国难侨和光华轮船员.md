Amidst the enthusiastic applause of the overseas Chinese, Liao Chengzhi delivered a speech. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai, have asked me to convey their greetings to you. You have worked hard! Chairman Mao is very concerned about your return and has repeatedly inquired about your health. I am very happy to see that although you have suffered a lot in Indonesia, your health has gradually recovered after returning to the motherland."

Liao Chengzhi said, "Under the oppression of the reactionary regime in Indonesia, our overseas Chinese have shown great unity and have fought bravely. We should learn from you and pay our respects to you! I encourage you to learn from Chairman Mao's works, participate in the socialist revolution and construction of the motherland under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, and become good workers, farmers, soldiers, and intellectuals. Chairman Mao has instructed us that the entire country should become a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military affairs. You will soon go to the farm to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. I hope that when you arrive at your workstation, you will study hard, work hard, train hard, and most importantly, master Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the people of the motherland, there is no difficulty you cannot overcome."

Liao Chengzhi said, "Our overseas Chinese have gone through the test of struggle in Indonesia. I believe that after returning to the motherland, you will definitely become a strong force in socialist construction. I wish you great progress and contributions in participating in the socialist construction of the motherland, studying Chairman Mao's works, and working together with the people of the entire nation."

The overseas Chinese who suffered hardships expressed their heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the people of the motherland for their care with the warmest applause.

Liao Chengzhi then visited the medical room at the residence of the overseas Chinese who suffered hardships and the ward at Zhanjiang People's Hospital, where he warmly visited the injured and sick overseas Chinese.

In the afternoon, Liao Chengzhi visited the Guanghua ship and warmly visited the crew members. Liao Chengzhi praised the crew members for overcoming all difficulties and excellently completing the first batch of receiving overseas Chinese tasks. He encouraged everyone to unite as one and complete the new battle tasks even better. All crew members of the Guanghua ship unanimously expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the motherland even better.
