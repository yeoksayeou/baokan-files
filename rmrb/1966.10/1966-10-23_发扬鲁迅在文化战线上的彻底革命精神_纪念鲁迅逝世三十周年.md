The great communist warrior and the brave standard-bearer of China's cultural revolution, Lu Xun, passed away thirty years ago. However, his spirit of thorough revolution, together with his rich cultural legacy, has always lived on in the revolutionary cause of our people.

As early as 1940, our great leader Chairman Mao had made a very high evaluation of Lu Xun's position in China's revolutionary history and revolutionary culture. Chairman Mao said:

Lu Xun is the commander of China's cultural revolution. He is not only a great writer but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary. Lu Xun's bones are the hardest; he has not an ounce of servility or flattery in him, which is the most precious quality for the people of a colony and a semi-colony. Lu Xun is the one who, on the cultural front, represents the majority of the nation, charging into the enemy's ranks with the most correct, most courageous, most resolute, most loyal, and most enthusiastic spirit. Lu Xun's direction is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation.

Lu Xun's immortal achievements are multifaceted. Here, we will discuss the issue of inheriting and carrying forward Lu Xun's spirit of thorough revolution on the cultural front.

As a revolutionary, Lu Xun was an uncompromising rebel against the old China. As a thinker and writer, his greatness first and foremost lies in his being a thorough critic of all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes.

In semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, as soon as Lu Xun entered the literary world, he used his pen as a sword and spear, launching a brave attack on imperialism and feudalism. During the May Fourth Movement, the novels and numerous political essays he wrote under the command of the pioneers of the communist revolution were all sharp daggers and spears, piercing straight into the heart of imperialism and feudal forces. His first novel, "Diary of a Madman," fiercely criticized the "civilization" of the feudal family system and feudal ethics, sharply exposing the fact that the several thousand years of "civilization" of the feudal ruling class were nothing but a bloody "cannibalistic feast" hidden under the sweet-sounding words of "benevolence, righteousness, and morality." He called out loudly: "This cannibalistic feast is still being set up, and there are many people who still want to keep it going. Sweeping away these cannibals, overturning this feast, and destroying this kitchen is the mission of the revolutionaries."

Starting from this resolute anti-feudal stance, for a period, Lu Xun directed his battle pen at feudal civilization and its domestic and foreign defenders, mercilessly dissecting and lashing out at them. It can be said that from the various reactionary warlords and politicians who advocated "reverence for Confucius" and "anti-communism," to the imperialist running dogs who hung the bell of the "special knowledge class"; from the various absurdities of the old scholars, young scholars, guardians of morality, and national essence advocates, to the semi-feudal and semi-colonial specialties of "cooing and flirting" and "butterfly and mandarin duck" erotic literature, all the demons and monsters were stripped of their disguises under Lu Xun's sharp daggers and spears.

"Against the deeply rooted so-called old civilization, launch an attack and make it shake," this was the rebellious task that Lu Xun set for himself at that time. He repeatedly taught revolutionary literary workers, "Without a pioneer who breaks through all traditional ideas and methods, China will not have real new literature." To have new literature, one must carry out a "thought revolution," absolutely not allowing "a car full of 'ancestral traditions,' 'old customs,' 'national essences,' etc., all wanting to pile up on the road, burying all the people completely," absolutely not allowing the "swamp of deception and fraud" to continue obstructing the wheels of history. One must definitely tear apart the ugly faces of all feudal guardians and all comprador slaves, and definitely bury all the old culture that poisons the people by the feudal class and imperialists. "If there is anything obstructing this path, whether it is ancient or modern, human or ghost, whether it is the 'Three Tombs' and 'Five Classics,' a thousand Song and a thousand Yuan, celestial sphere and river map, golden statues and jade Buddhas, ancestral pills, secret elixirs, all must be trampled down."

From 1927 onwards, over the next ten years, Lu Xun became a great communist warrior. "Originally, I hated this familiar class, and I did not regret its collapse. Later, due to the lessons of reality, I believed that only the rising proletariat has a future." This solemn oath marked the beginning of the brave standard-bearer of the May Fourth cultural revolution finding the true revolutionary path. Especially under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, and in the magnificent struggle of the Red Army led by Chairman Mao in the Soviet areas, Lu Xun received powerful support and drew spiritual strength for his battles, seeing the hope of a new China. From then on, his battles on the cultural front also had a new and great beginning. He regarded revolutionary literature as "one wing of the proletarian liberation struggle." Facing the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the "encirclement and suppression" of counter-revolutionary culture, Lu Xun raised the revolutionary banner of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism even higher on the cultural front. With his iron pen that sweeps away thousands of enemies, he responded to the armed struggle of the Red Army in the Soviet areas, conducting a more profound dissection and more powerful lashing out against the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and the various old ideas and old cultures that maintained this reactionary rule.

When the fighting left-wing literary front led by Lu Xun began to take shape, the Kuomintang reactionaries almost mobilized all the reactionary scholars and writers they could, waving various banners, launching a frenzied attack on the fighting left-wing literary front. They, in coordination with the Kuomintang's massacres, bans, and closures, brandished their rotten weapons, attempting to annihilate the proletarian literary army in one fell swoop. However, just as the Kuomintang's "encirclement and suppression" of the Red Army led by Chairman Mao suffered a shameful defeat, their cultural "encirclement and suppression" also ended in failure. Under Lu Xun's merciless exposure, not a single reactionary writer could escape the fate of defeat. Capture the ringleader first. Lu Xun, with his sharp, witty, and powerful iron pen, grabbed their representative figures, exposing their disguises in one stroke and revealing their reactionary essence. He called the "Crescent Society" the "stray dogs of the bankrupt capitalists"; he exposed in one stroke that the so-called "nationalist literature" was nothing but a "favorite dog literature" with fascist teeth; he sketched with great contempt the "comprador appearance" of Lin Yutang, who used "humor" to spread comprador ideology...

In summary, Lu Xun's scathing pen was invincible, and all the "demons and monsters" of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their slave culture were finally defeated and retreated in disarray. "While the communist Lu Xun became a great man of the Chinese cultural revolution in this 'encirclement and suppression.'"

In the arduous struggle against the old forces and old culture, Lu Xun was both daring to fight and good at fighting. He "came from the old camp," deeply understanding the serious harm of old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and also understanding that new proletarian culture could only "develop in the resistance against the old rulers and their culture." He pointed out very early on: "If these are not reformed, then this revolution will be fruitless, like building a tower on sand, collapsing in an instant." Therefore, even if it was just a small worm, Lu Xun never hesitated to use his dagger, digging them out bravely time and time again. In his long struggle against the old forces and old culture, he summed up many precious fighting experiences, teaching people to fight, to be vigilant, and to advance. He often admonished his comrades: "The struggle against the old society and old forces must be resolute, persistent, and uninterrupted, and attention must be paid to strength. The foundation of the old society is originally very solid, and the new movement cannot shake it without greater force. Moreover, the old society has its good ways to make the new forces compromise, but it itself is never compromising." Therefore, to thoroughly eliminate them—

First, one must engage in "tenacious" fighting or "trench warfare." Use "tenacity" to deal with the old forces' demons with "soft knives." "Tenacity" means holding on without letting go, unbending; "trench warfare" means strengthening one's own position, lying in the trenches calmly, advancing step by step, and cleverly defeating the enemy.

Second, one must carry forward the spirit of "beating a fallen dog." He pointed out sharply that "the nature of a dog does not change easily," and even if a dog is "pitiful" enough to fall into the water, it will still be a dog when it climbs out, still biting you, and at the very least, splashing you with mud. Therefore, he opposed indulging and tolerating evil, advocating that if you hit, you must hit to the end.

The spirit of thorough revolution of the communist warrior Lu Xun still deeply inspires us today.

In 1937, Chairman Mao praised Lu Xun enthusiastically: In the face of darkness and violence, he is a tree that stands independently, not a grass that leans to the sides. He saw clearly the political direction and fought bravely towards a goal, never surrendering or compromising halfway. At a time when we are thoroughly settling accounts with the Rongming opportunist line, Chairman Mao's high evaluation of Lu Xun is thought-provoking.

Next to this independently standing tree, who is the grass that leans to the sides? In the left-wing literary movement of the 1930s, there was always a fierce struggle between the true left and the false left, which was a fierce struggle between two classes and two lines. The politically far-sighted Lu Xun had long seen this. In his speech at the founding meeting of the Left-Wing Writers' League, he issued a warning: "'Left-wing' writers are very easy to become 'right-wing' writers." "Locked in a room, it is easiest to talk about thoroughgoing ideologies, but it is also easiest to 'right-lean.'" Finally, he pointed out meaningfully: "Our front cannot be united, which proves that our goals cannot be consistent, or it is only for a small group, or actually only for the individual. If the goals are all for the working masses, then the front will naturally be united."

Lu Xun deeply understood that "if there is a 'platform,' there will inevitably be struggles." Moreover, the foundation of the "Left League" was not good, and "some so-called revolutionary writers were actually the scattered descendants of the fallen gentry." Lu Xun's prophecy soon became a reality. The representatives of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated the left-wing line began to stir up trouble as soon as they stabilized their positions. They wore various disguises, firing clear shots and shooting dark arrows, all joining forces to "encircle and suppress" Lu Xun, forcing Lu Xun to fight fiercely on two fronts. In a letter, Lu Xun once expressed his indignation: "The likes of Ba'er are not to be feared. The most frightening are the so-called 'comrades' who are insincere, because they are impossible to guard against, such as the likes of Shao Bo (i.e., Tian Han). I still do not understand what he means? To guard the rear, I have to stand sideways, not facing the enemy. Moreover, looking forward and backward, it is even more laborious."

To guard the rear, "one has to stand sideways, not facing the enemy," this describes Lu Xun's situation at that time so accurately! And it vividly depicts the evil role of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang in the 1930s! The two classes and two lines cannot coexist peacefully in one "common body." These representatives of the bourgeoisie "encircled and suppressed" Lu Xun precisely because the fighting left-wing literature led by Lu Xun upheld and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. While the line advocated by Zhou Yang and his clique was the right-opportunist capitulationist line of Rongming. Thus, Lu Xun naturally became a thorn in their eyes. This sharp struggle finally, at a time when the Chinese nation was at a critical juncture of life and death in the 1930s, intensified around the debate over two slogans in the literary world.

The advocates of "National Defense Literature" led by Zhou Yang brazenly distorted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of the anti-Japanese national united front. Based on Rongming's bourgeois capitulationist line, they put forward the so-called slogan of "National Defense Literature" for the entire nation. They enthusiastically advocated: "The theme of national defense should become the central theme of the works of all writers except traitors." (Zhou Yang) This was clearly using the establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front as an excuse to eliminate class struggle, abandon the proletarian banner, and cancel the leadership of proletarian revolutionary literature.

In response to this capitulationist slogan, under the guidance of the correct line represented by Chairman Mao, Lu Xun clearly put forward the proletarian slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War of the Masses," and carried out an unyielding struggle against the bourgeois cultural line of Zhou Yang and his clique. This was the most concentrated and sharpest manifestation of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the cultural front in the 1930s.

In his article "On Our Current Literary Movement," Lu Xun clearly stated his position: "The proposal of a new slogan does not mean the cessation of the revolutionary literary movement," but rather its deeper and more practical development. He severely refuted Zhou Yang and his clique's fallacy of canceling proletarian leadership: "It is not that revolutionary literature wants to abandon its responsibility of class leadership, but rather that it increases and expands this responsibility."

Chairman Mao said in "On New Democracy": "Because the current Chinese revolution cannot be separated from the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, the current new culture of China cannot be separated from the leadership of the proletarian cultural thought of China, that is, it cannot be separated from the leadership of communist thought." Practice has proven that it was precisely Lu Xun's slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War of the Masses" that correctly implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of the anti-Japanese national united front; it was also Lu Xun who, at that time, based on Chairman Mao's correct line, resolutely defended the leadership of the revolutionary proletariat in the cultural realm.

Lu Xun's clear and uncompromising stance disrupted Zhou Yang and his clique's dream of capitulation. They immediately gathered all the dregs and launched a heinous "encirclement and suppression" against Lu Xun, who was seriously ill at the time. In the left-wing literary front at that time, the great Lu Xun was indeed a tree that stood independently!

The communist Lu Xun was very clear that for the revolutionary camp, the harm caused by the representatives of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated was very great, and they could play a destructive role that the reactionary rulers could not. Lu Xun pointed out deeply: "The enemy is not to be feared, the most frightening are the termites in our own camp, many things are ruined by them." Therefore, Lu Xun, even in his serious illness, uncompromisingly fought resolutely with them. His brilliant long article "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front" is the most systematic and comprehensive exposure and criticism of Zhou Yang and his clique's counter-revolutionary crimes of "raising a big flag as a tiger's skin."

Lu Xun was also very clear that this was a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership. If he tolerated Zhou Yang and his clique to stir up trouble on the literary front, it would cause great harm to the revolution. Therefore, he never forgot to expose them and lash out at them. After the publication of "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front," he still talked about continuing this struggle to the end in his correspondence.

In a letter dated August 28, 1936, Lu Xun said: "...Actually, the one who wrote this letter (referring to Xu Mo-yong) represents a certain group. If you read carefully, you can see the tone and understand. Therefore, I think it is more necessary to have a public reply. If it were just a personal matter between us, unrelated to the big picture, then why bother to chatter in the magazine? You think about this matter, it is not just a waste of energy, it is not so simple. It can expose the faces of the demons hiding under the shadow of the great banner, and see the recent Shanghai small newspapers and the like, this effect is already very obvious, they will eventually reveal their true selves in front of everyone."

Until four days before Lu Xun's death (October 15, 1936), he still remembered to point out: "These people, though despicable, are indeed harmful to people's hearts."

Always remembering class and class struggle, always remembering to resolutely defend the revolutionary interests of the proletariat, as Chairman Mao said, seeing clearly the political direction, fighting bravely towards a goal, never surrendering or compromising halfway. This is the fundamental reason why Lu Xun became a "great man of the Chinese cultural revolution" in the face of internal and external "encirclement and suppression."

However, Lu Xun's independently standing tree in the 1930s was not fighting alone, because the roots of this tree were deeply rooted in the soil of Chairman Mao's correct line. It was precisely Chairman Mao's leadership of the Red Army's armed struggle in the Soviet areas that inspired and promoted the fighting left-wing literary front led by Lu Xun. It was also Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of the anti-Japanese national united front that gave Lu Xun a powerful weapon to carry out a sharp struggle against Zhou Yang and his clique's bourgeois capitulationist cultural line.

When the Red Army ended the Long March and arrived in Shaanxi, it was Lu Xun in Shanghai who sent a telegram congratulating this historic victory. When the Trotskyite bandits maliciously slandered Chairman Mao, it was also Lu Xun who gave them a resolute rebuttal. In that famous reply to the Trotskyite bandits, he expressed his revolutionary feelings of respect and admiration for Chairman Mao, and proudly declared: "Those who are truly fighting for the survival of the Chinese people today, I am proud to consider them comrades." Recently, Comrade Xu Guangping's article also mentioned: "Lu Xun, although he did not have the opportunity to meet our great leader Chairman Mao in his lifetime, was enthusiastic in his support for Chairman Mao's wise leadership and sincerely convinced."

Lu Xun himself, in his article "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front," clearly said: "The policy of the anti-Japanese united front proposed by the revolutionary party (referring to the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao) to the people of the whole country, I have seen it, I support it, I unconditionally join this front."

In short, it was the Party and Chairman Mao who gave Lu Xun strength. It was also Lu Xun who resolutely defended the Party and Chairman Mao's correct line on the left-wing literary front.

Zhou Yang and his clique understood very well that in the 1960s socialist China, they wanted to revive the bourgeois cultural line. Chairman Mao's affirmation of Lu Xun's direction was a great obstacle to their counter-revolutionary plan. Therefore, in order to "clear the way," they had to distort history, create public opinion, and deceive the masses. In 1957, their farce of rehabilitating "National Defense Literature" was a major performance of this conspiracy. However, the ant trying to shake a big tree is laughable and does not know its own measure. No matter how carefully the counter-revolutionary revisionists planned, they could not escape the magic mirror of great Mao Zedong Thought. This group of 1930s clowns who had been hiding in the Party for decades and had not been reformed finally were thoroughly exposed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Lu Xun went from being a traitor to the feudal class to a great communist warrior, traveling a long road. The key to this leap was that Lu Xun always insisted on transforming his ideological stance in the practice of revolutionary struggle. As early as in the article "Written After the Grave," he talked about: "I indeed often dissect others, but more ruthlessly dissect myself." He constantly drew strength from the sublime spiritual world of the laboring masses. From his famous novel "Hometown," one can see how passionately he yearned for the life he spent with peasant children in his childhood and hated the era that separated him from Yun Tou. Especially the article describing the rickshaw puller helping an old woman who had fallen, "A Trifling Incident." The author felt the greatness of the laboring masses and his own insignificance from the rickshaw puller's upright behavior, and at the same time drew spiritual strength to transform himself from the excellent qualities of the laboring masses. The ending of the novel says: "...This trifling incident always floats before my eyes, sometimes even more clearly, making me ashamed, urging me to reform, and increasing my courage and hope."

When the communist doctrine began to spread in China, Lu Xun was not yet a Marxist. From the May Fourth Movement to the 1927 Revolution, Lu Xun went through a long period of painful exploration before becoming a great communist warrior. However, it should also be seen that Lu Xun's literary activities during the May Fourth period were still influenced by Marxism. In his words, he fought under the leadership and call of the communist "forerunners." He called his works "command literature," and he proudly declared: "The command I follow is that of the forerunners of the revolution at that time," "I must take the same steps as the forerunners."

After experiencing the split of the May Fourth cultural united front, the "March 18th Massacre" of patriotic students by the warlord Duan Qirui, the May 30th Movement, and especially the rise and failure of the 1925-1927 Revolution, Lu Xun's relationship with the Party became closer. During his time in Guangzhou, he had contact with many Communists and secretly met with the person in charge of the Party in Guangdong at that time. All of this promoted Lu Xun's ideological development and helped him see clearly the future of the Chinese revolution and the leading force of the Chinese revolution.

However, the reason why Lu Xun's path was so firm and powerful compared to others was that he accepted Marxism in the practice of revolutionary struggle. He was different from those who "issued shares last year, hired lawyers the year before, and only raised the banner of 'revolutionary literature' this year." His unwearying pursuit of revolutionary truth was to adapt to the needs of the battle, and first of all, to illuminate himself with revolutionary truth, dissect and transform his ideological stance.

The 1928 debate on "revolutionary literature," the initiators of the Creation Society and the Sun Society, made Lu Xun their target of attack. In the serious ideological struggle with them, Lu Xun not only deeply studied Marxism but also correctly grasped and used Marxism. He mentioned several times later that this debate brought him benefits: "I have one thing to thank the Creation Society for, they 'forced' me to read a few scientific literary theories, and I understood the doubts that the literary historians had been talking about for a long time but were still tangled up." He also said that during the debate, he was always "waiting for someone who could use the critical method of Marxism to shoot at" him, but "no one appeared." He thought this was because "there were too few such theories to refer to." Therefore, he took the initiative to study and translate, using Marxist weapons to criticize himself and arm himself. He compared this work to Prometheus stealing fire for mankind, and he declared with revolutionary enthusiasm: "I stole fire from another country, but my original intention was to cook my own flesh, thinking that if the taste was better, it might benefit the eater more, and I would not have wasted my body in vain." Lu Xun not only studied Marxism diligently himself but also advised revolutionary literary workers to "seek medical treatment from fundamental and practical social sciences," "the trend of the reading community towards social sciences is a good and proper turn, not only beneficial to other aspects but also to literature, it can promote it towards the correct and progressive path." Until he replied to the slander of Xu Mo-yong and Zhou Yang and his ilk before his death, he still said with confidence: "If I can survive, I will certainly continue to learn." Lu Xun also advocated learning Marxism in connection with reality. He warned young literary workers more than once: "Reading must be connected with real society, making the books read come to life." "If you do not come into contact with the actual social struggle, just stay in the glass window and write articles, research problems, no matter how radical, 'left,' it is easy to achieve; but as soon as you come into contact with reality, you will immediately hit a wall."

Because Lu Xun found Marxism and mastered the method of class analysis in the fierce class struggle; he recognized the truth of Marxism in seeking the way out of the Chinese revolution, using Marxism to dissect himself and transform himself, therefore, as soon as he took the path of a communist, he became a most steadfast proletarian warrior.

It is precisely because Lu Xun had this experience of self-transformation that he particularly valued the issue of the ideological stance of literary workers. He once clearly said: "The fundamental issue is whether the author is a 'revolutionary person.' If so, then no matter what event is written about, what material is used, it is all 'revolutionary literature.' Water comes out of a fountain, and blood comes out of a blood vessel."

Lu Xun was a steadfast proletarian revolutionary warrior. History has proven that in the 1930s, no matter how complex the class struggle situation was, no matter what split appeared in the left-wing literary front, and no matter what kind of reorganization and reordering took place within the revolutionary camp at the critical juncture of national survival, Lu Xun always stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary proletariat, with a far-reaching vision and keen political insight, skillfully identifying the true faces of various enemies through various disguises, tearing them apart, and conducting sharp exposure and powerful lashing out. Lu Xun always held high the revolutionary banner, standing on the frontline of the proletarian cultural front.

Today, as we commemorate Lu Xun in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must learn from Lu Xun's spirit of thorough revolution on the cultural front, definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, sweep away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left by the exploiting classes, and establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Today, as we commemorate Lu Xun, we must, like him, uncompromisingly carry out the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on two fronts and two lines, and like him, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's correct line. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, no matter what banner the enemy waves, what clothes they wear, or what form they appear in, as long as they oppose Mao Zedong Thought, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must all root them out, carry forward the spirit of beating a fallen dog, and fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to the end, showing no mercy to these counter-revolutionary revisionists.

Today, as we commemorate Lu Xun, we must, like Lu Xun in the battle, learn Marxism-Leninism in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls, seriously and diligently study Chairman Mao's works, master the great Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, examine everything, and transform everything, sweep away the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and truly become good students and good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Let us raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, shoulder the historical mission bestowed by the great era, carry forward Lu Xun's spirit of thorough revolution on the cultural front, and fight to the end to smash the old world and create a new world!

    发扬鲁迅在文化战线上的彻底革命精神
    ——纪念鲁迅逝世三十周年
    黎帆
    伟大的共产主义战士，中国文化革命的英勇旗手鲁迅逝世三十年了。但是，他彻底的革命精神，同他的丰富的文化遗产一起，一直永生在我国人民的革命事业中。
    早在一九四○年，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，就对鲁迅在我国革命史和革命文化史上的地位，作出了极高的评价。毛主席说：
    鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家。鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。
    鲁迅不朽的功绩是多方面的，这里谈谈继承和发扬鲁迅在文化战线上的彻底革命精神问题。
    一
    作为革命家的鲁迅，他是旧中国毫不妥协的革命造反者。作为思想家、文学家的鲁迅，他的伟大，首先也在于他是一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的彻底批判者。
    处在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，鲁迅一走上文坛，就用笔作刀枪，向帝国主义和封建主义展开了英勇的进攻。五四运动时期，他遵奉共产主义革命先驱的命令写出的小说和大量的政论杂文，都是极锋利的匕首和投枪，直刺到帝国主义和封建势力的心脏。他的第一篇小说《狂人日记》，猛烈地抨击了封建家族制度和封建礼教的“文明”，尖锐地揭露了封建统治阶级几千年的文明史，都不过是在“仁义道德”的动听词句下，掩盖着的血淋淋的人“吃人”的关系。他大声疾呼：“这人肉的筵宴现在还排着，有许多人还想一直排下去。扫荡这些食人者，掀掉这筵席，毁坏这厨房”，是革命者的使命。
    从这一坚决的反封建立场出发，在一个时期里，鲁迅把他战斗的笔锋，集中地指向封建文明及其国内外的维护者，毫不留情地解剖它们，鞭挞它们。可以说，从“尊孔”、“反赤”的形形色色的反动军阀、政客，到挂着“特殊知识阶级”铃铛的帝国主义走狗们；从五花八门的遗老、遗少、卫道者、国粹派的谬论，到“卿卿我我”、“蝴蝶鸳鸯”半封建半殖民地特产的色情文学等等，一切牛鬼蛇神，在鲁迅的锋利的匕首和投枪下，无一不被剥下画皮来。
    “对于根深蒂固的所谓旧文明，施行袭击，令其动摇”，这就是鲁迅当时给自己确定的造反任务。他反复教导革命文艺工作者，“没有冲破一切传统思想和手法的闯将，中国是不会有真的新文艺的。”要有新文艺，就必须进行“思想革命”，绝不能让“满车的‘祖传’，‘老例’，‘国粹’等等，都想来堆在道路上，将所有的人家完全活埋下去”，绝不能让“瞒和骗的大泽”继续阻碍历史的车轮。一定要撕破一切封建卫道者和一切买办洋奴的丑恶嘴脸，一定要把封建阶级和帝国主义者毒害人民的旧文化统统埋葬。“苟有阻碍这前途者，无论是古是今，是人是鬼，是《三坟》《五典》，百宋千元，天球河图，金人玉佛，祖传丸散，秘制膏丹，全都踏倒他。”
    从一九二七年以后的十年中，鲁迅成了伟大的共产主义战士。“原先是憎恶这熟识的本阶级，毫不可惜它的溃灭，后来又由于事实的教训，以为惟新兴的无产者才有将来”。这个庄严的誓言，标志着五四文化革命的英勇旗手，找到了真正的革命道路。特别是在毛主席正确路线的指引下，在毛主席所领导的苏区红军的波澜壮阔的斗争中，鲁迅得到了有力的支持，汲取了进行战斗的精神力量，看到了新中国的希望。从此，他在文化战线上的战斗，也有了一个新的伟大的开始。他把革命文艺看作“无产阶级解放斗争底一翼”。面对着国民党反动派的血腥统治和反革命文化“围剿”，鲁迅在文化战线上，更高地举起了反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的革命大旗，用他力扫千军的铁笔，与苏区工农红军的武装斗争遥相呼应，对国民党的反动统治，对形形色色的维护这种反动统治的旧思想和旧文化，进行了更深刻的解剖，更有力的鞭挞。
    当以鲁迅为首的战斗的左翼文学阵线开始形成的时候，国民党反动派几乎纠集了一切可以调动的反动学者和文人，亮出了形形色色的招牌，对战斗的左翼文学战线进行疯狂的围攻。他们配合着国民党的屠杀、查禁和封闭，挥舞起破烂武器，妄图一举歼灭无产阶级的文艺大军。但是，正像国民党对在毛主席领导下的工农红军的“围剿”遭到了可耻的失败一样，他们的文化“围剿”也一败涂地。在鲁迅的无情剥露下，没有一个反动文人能逃脱溃败的命运。擒贼先擒王。鲁迅用他那支又泼辣、又幽默、又有力的铁笔，抓住他们的代表人物，一语道破地撕开了他们的伪装，揭出了他们的反动本质。他称“新月派”为“丧家的资本家的乏走狗”；他一针见血地揭露了所谓“民族主义文学”不过是装着法西斯牙齿的“宠犬派文学”；他以极大的轻蔑勾划了利用“幽默”散布洋奴思想的林语堂的“西崽相”……。
    总之，鲁迅的辛辣的笔锋，所向披靡，国民党反动派及其奴才文化的各种“枭蛇鬼怪”，最后都被打得落花流水，败下阵去。“而共产主义者的鲁迅，却正在这一‘围剿’中成了中国文化革命的伟人。”
    在与旧势力、旧文化进行艰苦的奋战中，鲁迅既敢于斗争，又善于斗争。他“从旧营垒中来”，深知旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的严重危害性，也深知新的无产阶级文化只能“发达于对于旧支配者及其文化的反抗中”。他很早就指出：“倘不将这些改革，则这革命即等于无成，如沙上建塔，顷刻倒坏。”因而，哪怕发现的只是一只小小的蛀虫，鲁迅也从不吝惜自己的匕首，一遍又一遍地奋勇剜剔它们。他在与旧势力、旧文化的长期的斗争中，总结出了许多宝贵的斗争经验，教人战斗，教人警惕，教人前进。他经常告诫战友们说：“对于旧社会和旧势力的斗争，必须坚决，持久不断，而且注重实力。旧社会的根柢原是非常坚固的，新运动非有更大的力不能动摇它什么。并且旧社会还有它使新势力妥协的好办法，但它自己是决不妥协的。”因而，为了彻底消灭它们——
    第一，必须进行“韧”性的战斗或“壕堑战”。以“韧”的战斗，对付旧势力的拿着“软刀子”的妖魔。“韧”，就是咬住不放，百折不挠；“壕堑战”，就是有力地巩固自己的阵地，伏在壕沟里沉着应战，一步一步地前进，巧妙地战胜敌人。
    第二，必须发扬“打落水狗”精神。他尖锐地指出“狗性总不大会改变的”，狗即使“可怜”到落水，可是它爬上来仍旧是狗，仍旧要咬你一口，最低限度还要溅你一身污泥。所以，他反对纵恶和姑息，主张要打就得打到底。
    共产主义战士鲁迅的这种彻底革命精神，直到今天，仍然深深地激励着我们。

    一九三七年，毛主席这样热情地赞誉过鲁迅：他在黑暗与暴力的进袭中，是一株独立支持的大树，不是向两旁偏倒的小草。他看清了政治的方向，就向着一个目标奋勇地斗争下去，决不中途投降妥协。正在彻底清算王明机会主义路线的时候，毛主席这样高度评价鲁迅，是引人深思的。
    在这株独立支持的大树旁边，谁是向两旁偏倒的小草呢？三十年代的左翼文艺运动内部，一直存在着真左翼和假左翼的激烈斗争，也就是两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争。富有政治远见的鲁迅，早已洞察到了这一点。在左翼作家联盟成立大会的讲话中，他就提出了警告：“‘左翼’作家是很容易成为‘右翼’作家的。”“关在房子里，最容易高谈彻底的主义，然而也最容易‘右倾’。”最后他还意味深长地指出：“我们战线不能统一，就证明我们的目的不能一致，或者只为了小团体，或者还其实只为了个人，如果目的都在工农大众，那当然战线也就统一了。”
    鲁迅深深地懂得，“有一个‘坛’，便不免有斗争”。何况“左联开始的基础就不大好”，“有些所谓革命作家，其实是破落户的漂零子弟”。鲁迅的预言很快就变成了现实。混进左翼阵线的资产阶级代表人物，当他们一稳住阵脚，就开始捣乱了。他们披着形形色色的外衣，投明枪，射暗箭，一起“围剿”鲁迅，迫使鲁迅不得不在两条战线上展开激烈的斗争。鲁迅在一封信里，曾这样倾吐过自己的愤慨：“叭儿之类是不足惧的。最可怕的却是口是心非的所谓‘战友’，因为防不胜防，例如绍伯（即田汉）之流，我至今还不明白他是什么意思？为了防后方，我就得横站，不能正对敌人。而且瞻前顾后，格外费力。”
    为了防后方，“就得横站，不能正对敌人”，这多么确切地描绘了鲁迅当时的处境啊！又多么深刻地活画出反革命修正主义分子周扬一伙在三十年代的恶劣作用啊！两个阶级、两条路线是不能在一个“共同体”里和平共处的。这些资产阶级代表人物所以“围剿”鲁迅，就是因为以鲁迅为首的战斗的左翼文学，贯彻和捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。而周扬一伙所推行的，却是王明的右倾机会主义的投降路线。这样，鲁迅自然就成了他们的眼中钉。这场尖锐的斗争，终于在三十年代中华民族处于生死存亡的关头，围绕着文艺界的两个口号的争论激烈地展开了。
    以周扬为首的“国防文学”的鼓吹者，肆意篡改毛主席的抗日民族统一战线的无产阶级的革命路线。他们根据王明的资产阶级的投降主义路线，提出了所谓全民族的“国防文学”的口号。他们狂热地宣扬：“国防的主题应当成为汉奸以外的一切作家的作品之最中心的主题。”（周扬）这分明是借口建立抗日民族统一战线，抹杀阶级斗争，放弃无产阶级的旗帜，取消无产阶级革命文学的领导作用。
    针对这个投降主义的口号，鲁迅在以毛主席为代表的正确路线的指导下，明确地提出了“民族革命战争的大众文学”的无产阶级口号，对周扬一伙的资产阶级文化路线进行了不屈不挠的斗争。这是三十年代无产阶级和资产阶级在文化战线上的两条路线斗争的一次最集中、最尖锐的表现。
    鲁迅在《论现在我们的文学运动》一文里，鲜明地说出了自己的主张：“新的口号的提出，不能看作革命文学运动的停止”，而是它的更深入，更实际的发展。他严厉地驳斥周扬一伙取消无产阶级领导的谬论：“决非革命文学要放弃它的阶级的领导的责任，而是将它的责任更加重，更放大”。
    毛主席在《新民主主义论》中说：“由于现时中国革命不能离开中国无产阶级的领导，因而现时的中国新文化也不能离开中国无产阶级文化思想的领导，即不能离开共产主义思想的领导。”实践证明，正是鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号，正确地贯彻了毛主席的抗日民族统一战线的革命路线；也正是鲁迅，在当时根据毛主席的正确路线，坚决地捍卫了革命无产阶级在文化领域里的领导地位。
    鲁迅的鲜明的不妥协的立场，打乱了周扬一伙投降主义的美梦。他们立刻纠合一切败类，对正在重病中的鲁迅，进行了罪恶的“围剿”。在当时的左翼文学战线里，伟大鲁迅真是一株独立支持的大树啊！
    共产主义者的鲁迅十分清楚，对于革命阵营来说，周扬这类混进来的资产阶级代表人物危害是很大的，他们能起到反动统治者所不能起的破坏作用。鲁迅深刻地指出：“敌人是不足惧的，最可怕的是自己营垒里的蛀虫，许多事都败在他们手里。”所以鲁迅在重病中，毫不妥协地和他们展开了坚决的斗争。他的光辉的长篇论文《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》，就是对周扬一伙“拉大旗作为虎皮”的反革命罪行的最系统、最全面的揭露和批判。
    鲁迅也十分清楚，这是一场无产阶级和资产阶级争夺领导权的斗争，如果容忍周扬一伙在文艺战线上兴风作浪，就会给革命造成很大的损害。因而，他始终念念不忘揭露他们，鞭挞他们。在《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》发表以后，他还在通信中不断地谈到要把这场斗争进行到底。
    鲁迅在一九三六年八月二十八日的一封信中说：“……其实，写这信的虽是他一个（指徐懋庸），却代表着某一群，试一细读，看那口气，即可了然。因此我以为更有公开答复之必要。倘只我们彼此个人间事，无关大局，则何必在刊物上喋喋哉。先生虑此事，徒费精力，实不尽然，投一光辉，可使伏在大纛荫下的群魔嘴脸毕现，试看近日上海小报之类，此种效验，已极昭然，他们到底将在大家的眼前露出本相。”
    直到鲁迅逝世前四天（一九三六年十月十五日）的信里，他还念念不忘地指出：“此辈虽猥劣，然实于人心有害”。
    时刻不忘阶级和阶级斗争，时刻不忘坚决捍卫无产阶级的革命利益，如毛主席所说的，看清了政治的方向，就向着一个目标奋勇地斗争下去，决不中途投降妥协。这就是伟大鲁迅在内外“围剿”中，成为“中国文化革命的伟人”的根本原因。
    但是，鲁迅这株独立支持的大树，在三十年代决不是孤军作战的，因为这棵大树的根，深深地扎在毛主席正确路线的土壤里。正是毛主席在苏区领导的工农红军的武装斗争，鼓舞和推动了以鲁迅为首的战斗的左翼文学战线，也正是毛主席的抗日民族统一战线的伟大战略思想，给了鲁迅向周扬一伙资产阶级投降主义文化路线进行尖锐斗争的有力武器。
    当工农红军结束两万五千里长征胜利到达陕北时，是鲁迅在上海发去了祝贺这一历史性胜利的电报。当托洛斯基匪徒恶毒地诬蔑毛主席时，也是鲁迅给予了他们坚决的回击。在那封答托洛斯基匪徒的著名的回信里，他对毛主席充满了崇敬和爱戴的革命感情，并且自豪地宣称：“那切切实实，足踏在地上，为着现在中国人的生存而流血奋斗者，我得引为同志，是很以为光荣的。”最近许广平同志的文章也谈到：“鲁迅生前虽然没有能够见到我们伟大的领袖毛主席，但他对毛主席的英明领导，是热情拥护，心悦诚服的。”鲁迅自己在《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》一文中，更十分明确地说过：“革命的政党（按：指毛主席领导的中国共产党）向全国人民所提出的抗日统一战线的政策，我是看见的，我是拥护的，我无条件地加入这战线”。
    总之，正是党和毛主席给鲁迅以力量。也正是鲁迅在左翼文学战线上坚决地捍卫了党和毛主席的正确路线。
    周扬一伙很明白，在六十年代的社会主义中国，他们想复活资产阶级的文化路线，毛主席所大力肯定的鲁迅的方向，是他们实现反革命计划的一个大障碍。因而，他们要“扫清”道路，就必须颠倒历史，制造舆论，欺骗群众。一九五七年，他们为“国防文学”翻案的丑剧，就是这种阴谋策划的大演出。但是，蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。不管反革命修正主义分子怎样周密策划，他们总是逃不脱伟大的毛泽东思想的照妖镜。几十年来屡教不改埋伏在党内的这群三十年代的小丑，终于在无产阶级文化大革命中被彻底揭露了。
    三
    鲁迅从封建阶级的逆子贰臣，到伟大的共产主义战士，是走过了漫长的道路的。这个飞跃的关键，就在于鲁迅始终坚持在革命斗争的实践中改造自己的思想立场。他早在《写在〈坟〉后面》一文里，就谈到：“我的确时时解剖别人，然而更多的是更无情面地解剖我自己”。他不断地从劳动人民的崇高的精神世界里汲取力量。从他的有名的小说《故乡》里，可以看出，他是多么热情地怀恋幼年时和农民孩子在一起的生活，痛恨把自己和闰土“隔绝”的时代。特别是那篇描写人力车夫搀扶跌倒的老妇人的《一件小事》。作者从人力车夫的正直行为中，感到了劳动人民的伟大和自己的渺小，同时从劳动人民的优秀品质里汲取了改造自己的精神力量。小说的结束语说：“……这一件小事，却总是浮在我眼前，有时反更分明，教我惭愧，催我自新，并且增长我的勇气和希望。”
    当共产主义学说在中国开始传播的时候，鲁迅还不是马克思主义者。从五四运动到一九二七年的大革命，鲁迅是经过长期的痛苦探索，才成为伟大的共产主义战士的。不过，也应当看到，五四时期鲁迅的文学活动，还是接受了马克思主义的影响。用他的话说，他是在共产主义“前驱”的领导下、号召下进行战斗的。他把自己的作品叫做“遵命文学”，他自豪地宣称：“我所遵奉的，是那时革命的前驱者的命令”，“必须与前驱者取同一的步调”。
    经历了五四文化革命统一战线的分裂，经历了北洋军阀段祺瑞枪杀爱国学生的“三·一八”惨案，经历了五卅运动，特别是经历了一九二五年至一九二七年大革命的兴起和失败，鲁迅和党的关系更密切了。他在广州时期，曾经和很多共产党员有过接触，并秘密会见过当时党在广东方面的负责人。这一切，都推动了鲁迅思想的发展，都帮助他认清了中国革命的前途，中国革命的领导力量。
    但是，鲁迅的道路所以较之别人走得这样坚实有力，其关键就在于他是在革命斗争的实践中接受马克思主义的。他和那些“前年招股本，去年请律师，今年才揭起‘革命文学’的旗子”的人们不同。他对革命真理的不倦的追求，是为了适应战斗的需要，而且首先是用革命真理的光照亮自己，剖析和改造自己的思想立场。
    一九二八年的“革命文学”的论争，创造社和太阳社的倡导者们，把鲁迅当成了攻击的靶子。鲁迅在和他们进行严肃的思想斗争中，不仅深刻地钻研了马克思主义，而且正确地掌握和运用了马克思主义。他以后几次提到这次论战带给他的好处：“我有一件事要感谢创造社的，是他们‘挤’我看了几种科学底文艺论，明白了先前的文学史家们说了一大堆，还是纠缠不清的疑问。”又说，他在论战时，一直“等待有一个能操马克思主义批评的枪法的人来狙击”他，却“终于没有出现”。他想，这是因为“可供参考的这样的理论，是太少了”。于是他就亲自动手，一面学习，一面翻译，用马克思主义的武器批判自己，武装自己。他把这项工作比做是普罗米修士窃火给人间，他充满革命豪情地宣称：“我从别国里窃得火来，本意却在煮自己的肉的，以为倘能味道较好，庶几在咬嚼者那一面也得到较多的好处，我也不枉费了身躯”。鲁迅不只自己努力学习马克思主义，而且劝导革命的文艺家，都应当“求医于根本的，切实的社会科学”，“读书界的趋向社会科学，是一个好的，正当的转机，不惟有益于别方面，即对于文艺，也可催促它向正确，前进的路。”直到他在逝世前答复徐懋庸、周扬之流的诬蔑时，还充满信心地说：“倘能生存，我当然仍要学习”。鲁迅还提倡联系实际地学习马克思主义，他不只一次地警告青年文艺工作者：读书“必须和实社会接触，使所读的书活起来。”“倘若不和实际的社会斗争接触，单关在玻璃窗内做文章，研究问题，那是无论怎样的激烈，‘左’，都是容易办到的；然而一碰到实际，便即刻要撞碎了。”
    由于鲁迅是在激烈的阶级斗争中找到马克思主义，掌握阶级分析的方法的；是在探求中国革命出路中认识马克思主义的真理，运用马克思主义剖析自己、改造自己的，因此，当他一走上共产主义者的道路，就成了一个最坚定的无产阶级战士。
    也正是由于鲁迅有这种自我改造的体验，所以他特别重视文艺工作者的思想立场问题。他曾明确地说过：“根本问题是在作者可是一个‘革命人’，倘是的，则无论写的是什么事件，用的是什么材料，即都是‘革命文学’。从喷泉里出来的都是水，从血管里出来的都是血。”
    鲁迅是一个坚定的无产阶级革命战士。历史证明，在三十年代，不管阶级斗争形势多么复杂，左翼文学战线出现了什么分裂的局面，也不管在民族存亡的历史关头，革命营垒内部有什么样的重新改组，重新排队，鲁迅总是坚定地站在革命无产阶级一边，高瞻远瞩，以敏锐的政治洞察力，善于透过形形色色的伪装，确切地识别各种敌人的真面目，撕破它们，进行尖锐的揭露和有力的鞭挞。鲁迅始终高举革命大旗，屹立在无产阶级文化战线的前哨阵地上。
    今天，我们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中纪念鲁迅，就是要学习鲁迅在文化战线上的破旧立新的彻底革命精神，一定遵循毛主席的教导，横扫剥削阶级遗留下来的一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    今天，我们纪念鲁迅，就要像他那样毫不妥协地开展无产阶级对资产阶级的两个阶级两条路线的斗争，像他那样，坚决捍卫毛主席的正确路线。在无产阶级文化大革命中，不管敌人打着什么招牌，穿着什么外衣，以什么形式出现，只要他们反对毛泽东思想，反对无产阶级专政，反对无产阶级文化大革命，我们就要统统把它们揪出来，发扬打落水狗精神，把他们彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，决不怜惜这些反革命的修正主义分子。
    今天，我们纪念鲁迅，就要像鲁迅在战斗中学习马克思列宁主义那样，在当前这场触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命中，认真地刻苦地学习毛主席的著作，掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，检验一切，改造一切，横扫资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，使自己真正成为毛主席的好学生、好战士。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，肩负着伟大时代赋予我们的历史使命，发扬鲁迅在文化战线上的彻底革命精神，为砸烂旧世界创造新世界战斗到底吧！
