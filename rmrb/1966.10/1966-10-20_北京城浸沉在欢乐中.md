Our great leader Chairman Mao has received revolutionary youngsters for the fourth time, and the entire city of Beijing has been immersed in joy ever since. People enthusiastically discuss their happiness at seeing Chairman Mao. Radio waves have spread the news of Chairman Mao's reception nationwide. In the dormitories of revolutionary students and teachers, singing and laughter fill the air.

Singing, dancing, in this night of happiness

Revolutionary students and teachers from various places, after being inspected by our great leader, returned to their dormitories, but their hearts were still racing. Everyone wanted to sing, to cheer, to share the immense happiness of seeing our great leader Chairman Mao with comrades and family. At night, the dormitories were brightly lit. Some were busy writing letters, some were writing diaries, some were reading Chairman Mao's quotations, and more were gathered in groups, enthusiastically discussing their joy at seeing Chairman Mao.

In one dormitory, students from Mudanjiang Industrial School, Northeast Agricultural College, and Shanghai Pioneer Middle School held a get-together. A student from Mudanjiang Industrial School was the first to speak: "Comrades, today we saw our great leader Chairman Mao, it was so exciting! Let's sing together!" Everyone immediately sang "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" with great emotion. This song praising our great leader is sung every day, and tonight, it was sung with even more feeling. Next, students from Shanghai Pioneer Middle School sang a revolutionary song, and Korean revolutionary students danced and sang joyful Korean folk songs.

Singing, dancing, more and more people joined in. Some who had already gone to sleep got up and joined the extraordinary evening gathering. In no time, the number of participants grew from a few dozen to over two hundred.

At this get-together, singing and laughter never stopped. Faces glowing with happiness shone brightly under the lights.

Late into the night, everyone left the venue with revolutionary enthusiasm, ready to face new battles.

On the Fifty-Mile Red Road

Tiananmen Square is where our great leader Chairman Mao started his inspection by car. The next day, batch after batch of Red Guards and revolutionary students poured in from all directions. Everyone sat under Tiananmen, by the Golden Water Bridge, looking up at the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, reluctant to leave. Some wrote diaries here, some wrote letters, forever preserving their happiness and sharing it with family and comrades. More people formed long lines, patiently waiting to take photos in front of Chairman Mao's portrait.

A few Red Guards from Shenyang Machine Tool School walked twenty-plus miles along the red road that Chairman Mao traveled on the 18th, reaching Tiananmen. Along the way, they talked about their happiness at seeing Chairman Mao, encouraging each other to always follow Chairman Mao through storms and waves.

Li Zhengxiu, a Yi ethnic female student from Weidong County Middle School in Xichang District, Sichuan, saw Chairman Mao on the 18th, whom she had longed to see day and night. The next day, she came to Tiananmen with a heart full of excitement, standing in front of Chairman Mao's giant portrait. She said: Under Chairman Mao's leadership, our family was liberated from slavery; under Chairman Mao's leadership, I came from the deep mountains to Beijing; under Chairman Mao's leadership, our motherland will definitely be built into a paradise on earth.

On the 19th, many units along the fifty-mile red road were still in a state of excitement. On the lawn of Beijing Chemical Engineering University, revolutionary students gathered in groups, enthusiastically recalling the scene of Chairman Mao passing by their school. They were particularly proud that Chairman Mao not only waved to the revolutionary students but also carefully looked at their school.

Spread the Good News to Comrades at the Fastest Speed

Red Guards and revolutionary students who were received by Chairman Mao poured into the Beijing Telegraph Building in batches. They rushed to the telegram windows, entered the soundproof telephone booths, and posted letters into mailboxes. Thousands of words, one message: to spread the joy of seeing Chairman Mao to family and comrades as quickly as possible.

Some Red Guards raised their voices so high while making phone calls that the soundproof booths couldn't contain their excitement. Some, recalling the happy moment of seeing Chairman Mao, couldn't calm down, and their hands trembled as they drafted telegrams. The spacious business hall was packed with people. Some, unable to find a desk to write on, had to crouch on the floor.

An excited Red Guard, red-faced, came from Anhui. In the telegram he sent to all revolutionary students in his school, he wrote: "We saw our most beloved Chairman Mao at 1:20 PM on October 18, two meters away.... He smiled and waved at us, and we were extremely excited."

A revolutionary student representative from the northwest region wrote in a letter to his comrades: "On the 17th, we received the notice of Chairman Mao's reception, and everyone was so excited that they couldn't sleep. Early on the 18th, everyone got up and lined up, heading to the assembly point. Chairman Mao came to inspect our ranks in an open-top car. Chairman Mao is tall and strong, symbolizing the strength of our country. Chairman Mao is the embodiment of truth, the hope of mankind...."

Some telegrams said: "After seeing our most beloved Chairman Mao, with Chairman Mao's care and hope, we will quickly return to make a big fuss about the revolution."

On this day, nearly six thousand telegrams were sent from here, more than twice the usual amount. Long-distance calls increased by nearly four times. Letters were received and mailed at a rate of six to seven hundred per hour, seven to eight times the usual amount. The staff of the Telegraph Building were inspired and encouraged by these enthusiastic young people, completely forgetting fatigue and thirst. Their workload increased several times, but they ensured the quality of their work, delivering the young people's messages to every corner of the country at the fastest speed.

    北京城浸沉在欢乐中
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席第四次接见革命小将之后，整个北京城一直浸沉在欢乐中。人们热情地谈论着见到毛主席的幸福心情。电波把毛主席接见的喜讯传向全国。革命师生的宿舍里，歌声不断，笑声四起……。
    唱呵，跳呵，在这幸福之夜
    各地革命师生接受了伟大领袖的检阅，回到宿舍以后，心怎么也不能平静。人人都想歌唱，都想欢呼，都想把见到伟大领袖毛主席的巨大幸福，告诉给战友和亲人。晚上，宿舍里灯光明亮，有的在忙着写信，有的在写日记，有的在阅读毛主席语录，更多的是三五成群畅谈见到毛主席的欢乐心情。
    在一个宿舍里，牡丹江工业学校、东北农学院、上海前锋中学的革命师生，开了一个联欢会。牡丹江工业学校一位同学最先发言：“同学们，今天见了伟大领袖毛主席，真是太激动了，让我们同声歌唱吧！”大家马上兴奋地唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》。这支歌颂伟大领袖的歌曲，大家天天都唱，今晚，大家唱得更有感情。接着，上海前锋中学的师生唱了一支革命歌曲，朝鲜族的革命师生跳起了优美欢乐的朝鲜舞，唱起了表达幸福心情的朝鲜族民歌。
    唱呵，跳呵，参加的人越来越多。有的人已经睡了，又穿上衣服赶来参加这个不平凡的晚会，一会儿就由原来的几十个人，增加到二百多人。
    在这个联欢会上，歌声不断，笑声不断。一张张幸福的笑脸，在灯光下显得朝气勃勃。
    夜深了，大家满怀革命豪情离开会场，准备迎接新的战斗。
    在五十里红色大道上
    天安门广场，是我们伟大领袖毛主席乘车检阅的起点。第二天，一批又一批的红卫兵和革命师生，从四面八方拥来。大家坐在天安门下，金水桥边，昂首望着毛主席的巨幅画像，久久不肯离去。有人在这里写日记，有人在这里写信，把幸福永远记下来，把幸福分送给亲人和战友。更多的人排成长长的队伍，耐心地等待着，在毛主席像前摄影留念。
    沈阳机床工业学校的几名红卫兵，沿着毛主席十八日通过的红色大道，徒步二十几里，来到天安门前。他们一路上边走边谈，回忆着见到毛主席时的幸福心情，相互鼓励，要永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进。
    四川西昌专区会东县中学彝族女学生李正秀，十八日见到了日想夜盼的毛主席。第二天，她又怀着激动的心情来到天安门，来到毛主席的巨幅画像前面。她说：在毛主席领导下，我们一家人才从奴隶制度下解放出来；在毛主席领导下，我才能从深山里来到了北京；在毛主席领导下，我们的祖国一定能建设成幸福的人间天堂……。
    五十里红色大道两旁的许多单位，十九日还是一片欢腾。在北京化工学院的草坪上，革命师生三五成群，热情地回忆着毛主席从学校门前经过的情景。谈到毛主席不但向革命师生们招手致意，还很注意地看了看他们的学校，大家得意极了。
    用最快的速度把喜讯告诉战友
    受到毛主席接见的红卫兵和革命师生，一批又一批地涌进北京电报大楼。他们奔向发电报的窗口，走进隔音的电话室里，并把一封封书信投进邮箱……。千言万语，一个意思，就是要把见到毛主席的喜讯最快地传给亲人和战友。
    有的红卫兵打电话的时候，嗓门提得很高，隔音间也隔不住他们激动的声音。有的人回想起见到毛主席的幸福时刻，心情怎么也平静不下来，在起草电报底稿时，激动得手直打颤。宽大的营业厅里挤满了人，有人一时找不到写字的桌子，只好伏在地板上写。
    一个兴奋得满脸通红的红卫兵，来自安徽。他在发给全校革命师生的电报中说：“我们于十月十八日下午一时二十分见到了最最敬爱的毛主席，距离两米，……他老人家向我们微笑招手，我们兴奋极了。”
    一位来自西北地区的革命师生代表，在写给自己战友的信中说：“十七日得到了毛主席接见的通知，大家兴奋得怎么也睡不着。十八日一大早，大家就起床排队，走向集合地点。毛主席是乘着敞篷汽车来检阅我们队伍的。毛主席身体魁梧，象征着我们国家的力量。毛主席是真理的化身，人类的希望。……”
    有的电报说：“见了最最敬爱的毛主席，带着毛主席的关怀和希望，我们很快就回来大闹革命。”
    这一天，从这里发出了近六千份电报，比平日增加了两倍以上。长途电话增加了近四倍。信件每小时收寄六七百件，比平时增加了七八倍。电报大楼职工，被这些热情洋溢的青年人感染着，鼓舞着，完全忘了疲劳和饥渴。这一天，他们的工作量增加了几倍，但是，他们保证了工作质量，用最快的速度把年青人的心意传递到全国的每一个角落。
