The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a strongly worded protest to the Indonesian Embassy in China on October 21, condemning the Indonesian government's inhumane persecution and expulsion of overseas Chinese.

The note pointed out that the Indonesian government's persecution of overseas Chinese has escalated to the point of collective expulsion. Now, the Indonesian government is taking advantage of China's dispatch of ships to repatriate overseas Chinese, seizing their property and cutting off their livelihoods, attempting to drive them out of Indonesia in batches. This is something the Chinese government absolutely will not tolerate and will not allow to happen.

The note said that in recent periods, the Indonesian government has intensified its anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese policies, subjecting overseas Chinese living in various parts of Indonesia to even more brutal persecution. In West Java, South Sulawesi, South Kalimantan, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra, large numbers of overseas Chinese have been repeatedly attacked and robbed by right-wing thugs. Their homes have been destroyed, shops have been forced to close, signs have been smashed, and goods have been looted. Many overseas Chinese have been insulted, beaten, and arbitrarily arrested, even being collectively imprisoned. Thousands of overseas Chinese are now in a situation where their livelihoods are cut off and their lives and property are unprotected.

The note said that it is particularly worth noting that after the Aceh authorities expelled a large number of overseas Chinese, right-wing reactionary forces in various parts of Indonesia have launched a wave of expelling overseas Chinese. Some local military and political authorities in West Java and South Sulawesi have ordered local overseas Chinese to leave within a set time, and have sent thugs to drive them out. The provincial assemblies of South Sulawesi and South Kalimantan have made decisions to expel overseas Chinese on a large scale. The military commander of Bangka Belitung in South Sulawesi issued an expulsion order on September 22, requiring all overseas Chinese in the area to leave by September 27. Currently, a large number of overseas Chinese have been forced to move to Makassar. The Immigration Department of West Java has issued an order to force local overseas Chinese to leave within a set time. At the same time, various right-wing thug organizations such as "KAMI" and "KAPPI" are loudly calling for the expulsion of all "Chinese," banning overseas Chinese from speaking Chinese, reading Chinese newspapers, and listening to Beijing broadcasts, and threatening to launch a larger-scale persecution of overseas Chinese. All of this shows that the Indonesian government's persecution of overseas Chinese has escalated to the point of collective expulsion. The Chinese government strongly protests the Indonesian government's inhumane persecution and expulsion of overseas Chinese.

The note pointed out that overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations have formed a deep bond with the Indonesian people. They have made active contributions to promoting friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia, supporting the Indonesian people's struggle to maintain national independence and oppose imperialism, and to the development of Indonesia's national economy. No one can erase the contributions of the broad masses of overseas Chinese with any pretext or fabricated charges. According to the relevant treaties and agreements signed by the Chinese government and the Indonesian government, the Indonesian government has the obligation to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Now, the Indonesian government is acting unilaterally, reneging on its treaty obligations, and using various coercive measures to persecute and expel overseas Chinese on a large scale. This not only violates international norms, but also goes against the national interests of Indonesia.

The note said that it is worth noting that the persecution and expulsion of overseas Chinese is taking place while the Chinese government is dispatching ships to repatriate the affected overseas Chinese. Arranging ships and assisting the affected overseas Chinese to return to their country is a responsibility that the Indonesian government should fulfill. Due to the Indonesian government's failure to fulfill this responsibility, the Chinese government decided to dispatch ships to repatriate the affected overseas Chinese. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that the Indonesian government must immediately stop persecuting overseas Chinese and ensure the safety of their lives and property, otherwise, the repatriation work will be difficult to carry out. The Indonesian government has neither fulfilled its responsibility to arrange ships and assist the affected overseas Chinese to return to their country, nor has it paid any attention to the Chinese government's reasonable demands. Instead, you are taking advantage of the Chinese government's dispatch of ships to repatriate overseas Chinese, seizing their property and cutting off their livelihoods, attempting to drive them out of Indonesia in batches. This is something the Chinese government absolutely will not tolerate and will not allow to happen.

The note finally said that the Chinese government must warn the Indonesian government that the dispatch of ships to repatriate overseas Chinese does not mean that the Indonesian government can shirk its responsibility for the affected overseas Chinese, nor does it mean that the Indonesian government can arbitrarily expel overseas Chinese. The Chinese government demands that the Indonesian government immediately stop persecuting and expelling overseas Chinese and ensure the safety of their lives and property. Otherwise, the Indonesian government must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

    我外交部照会强烈抗议印尼政府变本加厉迫害华侨
    中国政府绝不容忍印尼当局集体驱赶华侨
    新华社二十一日讯  中华人民共和国外交部二十一日照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，对印尼政府惨无人道地迫害和驱赶华侨的行为提出强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，印度尼西亚政府对华侨的迫害越演越烈，已经发展到集体驱赶华侨的严重地步。现在印度尼西亚政府竟然利用中国政府派船接侨，大肆掠夺华侨的财产，断绝他们的生计，企图一批一批地把他们赶出印度尼西亚，这是中国政府绝对不能容忍的，也是绝对行不通的。
    照会说，最近一个时期以来，印度尼西亚政府加紧推行反华排华政策，对居住在印度尼西亚各地的华侨进行了更加残酷的迫害。在西爪哇、南苏拉威西、南加里曼丹、北苏门答腊和西苏门答腊等地，大批华侨遭到右派暴徒的轮番袭击和抢劫，华侨的住宅横遭破坏，商店被勒令停业，招牌被捣毁，货物被抢劫一空。许多华侨遭到侮辱殴打和无理逮捕，甚至被集体监禁。数以千计的华侨已处在生计断绝、生命财产毫无保障的境地。
    照会说，特别需要指出的是，继亚齐当局大批驱赶华侨之后，印度尼西亚各地右派反动势力正掀起一股驱赶华侨的浪潮。西爪哇和南苏拉威西的一些地方军政当局下令当地华侨限期离境，并出动暴徒驱赶华侨。南苏拉威西和南加里曼丹的省议会作出了大规模驱逐华侨的决定。南苏拉威西邦加英宜驻军司令九月二十二日发布驱逐令，限当地所有华侨必须在今年九月二十七日前搬离该地。目前已有一大部分华侨被迫迁到望加锡。西爪哇移民厅发布了逼迫当地华侨限期离境的命令。与此同时，各地“卡比”和“卡米”等右派暴徒组织大肆叫嚣要赶走所有“支那人”，不准华侨讲中国话、看中文报和收听北京广播，并威胁要发动一次更大规模的迫害华侨的运动。这一切都说明，印度尼西亚政府对华侨的迫害越演越烈，已经发展到集体驱赶华侨的严重地步。中国政府对印度尼西亚政府这样惨无人道地迫害和驱赶华侨的行为，提出强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，世代居住在印度尼西亚的华侨，同印度尼西亚人民结成血肉相连的情谊。他们对增进中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友好，对支持印度尼西亚人民维护民族独立和反对帝国主义的斗争，对印度尼西亚民族经济的发展，都作出了积极的贡献。任何人企图以任何借口或莫须有的罪名，抹煞广大华侨的这种贡献，是永远办不到的。根据中国政府同印度尼西亚政府签订的有关条约和协议，印度尼西亚政府负有保护华侨正当权利和利益的义务。现在，印度尼西亚政府竟然一意孤行，背弃自己应承担的条约义务，采取种种强制手段，大规模迫害和驱赶华侨。这不仅破坏了国际关系准则，而且也违背了印度尼西亚的民族利益。
    照会说，值得注意的是，上述迫害和驱赶华侨是在中国政府派船接运受害华侨的时候进行的。安排船只，协助受害华侨回国，本来是印度尼西亚政府应尽的责任。由于印度尼西亚政府未履行这一责任，中国政府才决定派船接回受害华侨。中国政府曾一再提出，印度尼西亚政府必须立即停止迫害华侨，切实保障华侨生命财产的安全，否则，接侨工作将难于进行。印度尼西亚政府既不履行安排船只、协助受害华侨回国的义务，又完全无视中国政府的上述合理要求。你们竟利用中国政府派船接侨，大肆掠夺华侨的财产，断绝他们的生计，企图一批一批地把他们赶出印度尼西亚。这是中国政府绝对不能容忍的，也是绝对行不通的。
    照会最后说，中国政府有必要正告印度尼西亚政府，中国政府派船接侨，绝不意味着印度尼西亚政府就可以推卸它对受害华侨应负的责任，更不意味着印度尼西亚政府可以恣意赶走华侨。中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止迫害和驱赶华侨，切实保证华侨的生命财产的安全。否则，印度尼西亚政府必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
