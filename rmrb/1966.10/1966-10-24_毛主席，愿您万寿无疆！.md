Your name is known to everyone. I, a revolutionary, salute you.

You are loved and revered by the people. You are a friend, a leader, and a teacher.

Your brilliant ideas shine like a beacon in the dark night,
Your wise star is a lighthouse for the working class.

You have brought glory to China.
In the past, imperialism and its running dogs turned China into a hell,
Today, you have turned China into a paradise on earth.

You are the red dawn, and the paper tigers have nowhere to hide from you.
You are a marksman who never misses, striking right at the heart of imperialism.

You wield an iron broom, sweeping away all remnants and dregs.
As long as you are alive, thieves will never be able to extinguish the light of truth!

Although you are already seventy-three years old, your face still radiates the glow of labor and unparalleled honor.

I wish you deep blessings, long live Chairman Mao!

    毛主席，愿您万寿无疆！
    巴基斯坦　塔利布·贾伦达
    您的名字家喻户晓。我，一个革命者，向您致敬。
    您受人们爱戴，受人们景仰。您是朋友，是领袖，是导师。
    您的思想明珠在黑夜中华光闪烁，
    您的智慧红星是工人阶级的灯塔。
    您为中国增添了荣光。
    过去，帝国主义及其走狗把中国变成地狱，
    今天，您把中国变成人间天堂。
    您是红色的曙光，纸老虎见了您无处躲藏。
    您是百发百中的射手，正中帝国主义的胸膛。
    您挥起铁扫帚，把残渣余孽一扫而光。
    只要有您健在，窃贼就休想熄灭真理之光！
    您虽然已经高龄七十三，但您的脸上依然焕发着劳动的神采和无尚的荣光。
    深深为您祝福，愿您万寿无疆！
