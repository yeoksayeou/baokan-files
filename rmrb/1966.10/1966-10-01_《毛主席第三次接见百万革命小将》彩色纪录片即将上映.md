The color documentary "Chairman Mao's Third Reception of Millions of Revolutionary Youngsters" will soon be released nationwide. This film, along with "Chairman Mao with the Million-Strong Cultural Revolution Army" and "Chairman Mao Receives the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students and Teachers," will be shown during the National Day celebrations, bringing great joy and inspiration to the revolutionary people across the country.

This film was jointly produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and the August First Film Studio. It faithfully recreates the historic scene of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao receiving millions of Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers from across the country and the capital on September 15.

At the beginning of the film, the audience is taken to the heart of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the capital of our great motherland. Here, revolutionary fervor is everywhere, and the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shines everywhere: the workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call to seize the revolution and promote production, striving for new victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. United by the red thread of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary students and teachers from all over the country learn from each other, support each other, and exchange experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the Cultural Revolution. The young revolutionaries take the People's Liberation Army as their example, eagerly study Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, seriously implement Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. These scenes fully demonstrate the firm resolve of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary students and teachers to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people.

When our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao and other central leaders, ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum at 5 PM, the screen showed a vast sea of red. Chairman Mao affectionately waved to the Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers on the Tiananmen Rostrum and square, and the young revolutionaries, with tears of joy in their eyes, held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The screen also showed Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, appearing again on the brightly lit Tiananmen Rostrum at 8:30 PM, with Chairman Mao walking to the east and west ends of the rostrum, waving and greeting the cheering and jumping Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers, in a moving scene.

The film also records Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai delivering speeches, which were warmly received by the entire audience, and the scene of Red Guards and revolutionary student representatives expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The film also shows Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao posing for a photo with Comrade Jiao Yulu's daughter, Jiao Shuyun.

    新华社三十日讯　大型彩色纪录片《毛主席第三次接见百万革命小将》，即将在全国各地陆续上映。这部影片和《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》、《毛主席接见红卫兵和革命师生》两部纪录片在国庆期间同时放映，将给全国革命人民带来极大的幸福和鼓舞。
    这部影片是由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂和八一电影制片厂联合摄制的。它真实地再现了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，在九月十五日第三次接见来自全国各地和首都的百万红卫兵和革命师生这一具有伟大历史意义的场景。
    影片一开始，就把观众引进了无产阶级文化大革命的中心——我们伟大祖国的首都。这里，到处洋溢着热气腾腾的革命景象，到处闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉：工农兵群众热烈响应毛主席和党中央抓革命促生产的伟大号召，正在为夺取社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新胜利而奋斗。由毛泽东思想这根红线串连在一起的全国各地革命师生为了共同的革命目标，互相学习，互相支持，互相交流活学活用毛主席著作和文化大革命的经验。革命小将们处处以解放军为榜样，努力学习毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，认真贯彻毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想。这些镜头充分显示了广大工农兵、红卫兵和革命师生忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于党、忠于人民的坚定意志。
    当我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志于下午五时登上天安门城楼时，银幕上出现了一片波涛翻滚的红色海洋。毛主席慈祥地向登上天安门城楼和广场上的红卫兵和革命师生频频招手，革命小将们闪烁着幸福的泪花，高举着红色的《毛主席语录》，纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”银幕上还再现了毛主席和林彪同志以及中央其他领导同志一起，在晚上八时半又一次出现在灯火辉煌的天安门城楼上，毛主席走向城楼的东西两头，向欢呼、跳跃的红卫兵和革命师生招手致意的激动人心的场面。
    影片还记录了林彪同志、周恩来同志发表讲话，受到全场热烈欢迎；以及红卫兵、革命师生代表在讲话中表示要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心的场景。毛主席和林彪同志同焦裕禄同志的女儿焦守云合影的情形，也出现在银幕上。
