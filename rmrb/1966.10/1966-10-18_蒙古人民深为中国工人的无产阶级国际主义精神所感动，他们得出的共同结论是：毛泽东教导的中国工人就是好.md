The Mongolian people are deeply moved by the internationalist spirit of Chinese workers. They have reached a common conclusion: the Chinese workers taught by Mao Zedong are truly great.

Chinese workers assisting in Mongolia have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, have toiled tirelessly for a decade in various construction projects across Mongolia, contributing to the economic and social life of the Mongolian people. The noble spirit and actions of Chinese workers have deeply touched the hearts of the Mongolian people, who enthusiastically praise these workers sent by Mao Zedong.

Over the past decade, Chinese workers in Mongolia have completed numerous major projects. These include a 377-meter-long large bridge, over 110 kilometers of roads within Ulaanbaatar and its suburbs, several large building complexes with a total area of tens of millions of square meters, and many modern enterprises. The Mongolian people regard these projects as "symbols of the great friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples."

When the Peace Bridge in Ulaanbaatar, built by Chinese workers, was handed over, even herdsmen from over a hundred miles away came to participate. They caressed the bridge railings and pressed their faces against the polished stone, reluctant to leave. After the completion of the first phase of Ulaanbaatar's residential project, a Mongolian resident who moved into a new home excitedly said he wanted to send a telegram of thanks to Chairman Mao.

Through these large-scale projects and the selfless work of Chinese workers over the past decade, the Mongolian people have clearly seen that the Chinese people, with their high sense of proletarian internationalism, are the most reliable, selfless friends and brothers. They praise the Chinese workers' spirit of hard work, dedication, and high sense of responsibility. They say, "The Chinese workers are genuinely helping us build, with no ulterior motives." They believe that China's aid is "silent but visible and tangible," unlike some countries' aid that is "heard but not seen or felt." They highly evaluate the quality and efficiency of China's aid projects in Mongolia, saying, "The construction progress is exceptionally fast, and the quality is exceptionally good, serving as a model for Mongolian construction workers." Mongolian workers who have long worked alongside Chinese workers sincerely expressed their desire to pass on "the style and techniques taught by Chinese comrades," because "this is the most precious gift left by Chinese comrades."

"Mao Zedong is good, China is good, and the Chinese workers taught by Mao Zedong work well." This is the common conclusion reached by the Mongolian people after a decade of experience. Therefore, whenever the Mongolian people express their heartfelt friendship to Chinese workers, they always say, "Mao Zedong is very good, very good."

When Chinese workers were building a road in Ulaanbaatar, a Mongolian man in his thirties came to the construction site and said, "You are doing a great job, and all Mongolian people can see it. You are working under the guidance of Mao Zedong's thoughts." An elderly retired worker, after visiting a residential project covering 220,000 square meters, said, "Chinese workers not only helped us build many high-rise buildings but also saved many Mongolian lives during the Ulaanbaatar flood. I greatly admire Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is like Lenin, he is the greatest leader."

When a certain Chinese unit in Mongolia was about to move to another place, local Mongolian residents specially came to see them off. They said, "China is good, Mao Zedong is good. Only the new China led by Chairman Mao can help us in the most difficult times. We will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness."

Now, thousands of Chinese workers in Mongolia, after studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and better complete their tasks in Mongolia, letting Mao Zedong Thought shine brightly in China's aid projects in Mongolia.

    蒙古人民深为中国工人的无产阶级国际主义精神所感动，他们得出的共同结论是：
    毛泽东教导的中国工人就是好
    中国援蒙工人牢记毛主席的教导，根据无产阶级国际主义精神，十年如一日，艰苦奋战在蒙古各地许多建设战线上，为蒙古人民的经济生活作出了贡献。中国工人的崇高精神和行动深深地打动了蒙古人民的心，他们热烈赞扬这些毛泽东派来的好工人。
    十年来，中国援蒙工人先后为蒙古人民建成了大量的工程项目。其中有长达三百七十七米的大型桥梁，总长度为一百一十多公里的乌兰巴托市内道路和郊区公路，总面积达几十万平方米的大建筑群和许多现代化企业。蒙古人民把这些工程看作是“蒙中两国人民伟大友谊的象征”。
    当中国援蒙工人修建的乌兰巴托市和平大桥举行移交仪式时，离城一百多里以外的牧区人民也赶来参加。他们情意深长地抚摸着桥栏，用脸紧贴在水磨石上，久久舍不得离开。乌兰巴托第一期住宅工程竣工后，搬进新居的一位蒙古人激动地表示，他要给毛主席拍个感谢电。
    通过中国援蒙的这些巨大工程，通过中国工人十年来的忘我劳动，蒙古人民清楚地看到，具有高度无产阶级国际主义精神的中国人民是最可信赖的大公无私的朋友和兄弟。他们对中国工人不怕苦、不怕累、干劲大、责任心强的高尚品质赞不绝口。他们说，“中国工人是真心实意帮助我们建设的，没有任何私心”。他们认为中国的援助是“听不见，看得见，摸得着”，而不像有些国家的援助那样，光是“听得见”，可是“看不见，摸不着”。他们高度评价中国援蒙工程的质量和效率，认为“施工进度特别快，工程质量特别好，是蒙古工人建筑施工的典范”。曾经长期同中国工人并肩劳动的蒙古工人诚挚地表示，要把“中国同志的作风和教给的技术传下去”，因为“这是中国同志留给他们最珍贵的礼物”。
    “毛泽东好，中国好，毛泽东教导出来的中国工人干得好。”这是蒙古人民积十年之经验得出的共同结论。因此，每当蒙古人民向中国援蒙人员倾吐内心的友情时，总是口口声声地说：“毛泽东依赫赛、依赫赛（毛泽东非常好、非常好）。”
    中国援蒙工人在修建乌兰巴托的一条道路时，一位三十多岁的蒙古人走到工地说：“你们干得就是好，我们蒙古人都看得清楚。你们是在毛泽东思想指导下这样干的。”一位退休老工人在参观了二十二万平方米的住宅工程以后说：“中国工人不但帮助我们建设了许多高楼，乌兰巴托闹大水时还救了很多蒙古人的命。我非常崇拜毛主席，毛主席就是列宁，他是最伟大的领袖。”
    中国援蒙某单位要移到另一个地方时，周围的蒙古居民特地前来送行。他们说：“中国好，毛泽东好，只有毛主席领导的新中国，才能在最困难的时候帮助我们。我们永远忘不了毛主席的好处。”
    现在，数千名中国援蒙工人学习了党的八届十一中全会的公报以后纷纷表示：要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，更好地完成援蒙任务，让毛泽东思想在中国援蒙工程上大放光芒。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
