	Once, due to my carelessness, I lost my ammunition pouch. It took a lot of time to find it, but the small oil bottle inside was gone. What should I do? If I spoke up, it would be considered a responsibility accident, not only would my "five good" status be at risk, but the "four good" class might also be affected. After much thought, I decided to hide it. However, from then on, I carried a heavy burden in my heart. I didn't dare to criticize others' shortcomings, fearing that they might expose my own. Later, after repeatedly studying "In Service of the People," I gradually realized the seriousness of this issue. How could a Communist Party member deceive the leadership and comrades over the "five good" issue? So, I bravely revealed my thoughts and asked the leaders and comrades to criticize and help me.

	This incident taught me a profound lesson. Although the oil bottle was small, it reflected that my ideological transformation was far from complete. In the future, I will definitely take Lei Feng and Wang Jie as my examples and establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    事情小反映的问题不小
    副班长  蔡菊生
    有一次，由于我粗心大意，把子弹袋丢掉了。后来费了不少时间才把它找回来，可是里面的小油壶没有了。怎么办呢？说出来吧，这是个责任事故，不但自己的五好不保险，弄不好四好班也会吹掉。想来想去，把它隐瞒下来了。但是，从此我却背上了一个思想包袱。别人有了缺点我也不敢大胆地开展批评，生怕人家把我的短处揭出来。后来反复学习了《为人民服务》，我才逐渐认识到这个问题的严重性。一个共产党员，怎么能为五好问题欺骗领导、欺骗同志呢？于是我大胆地把思想“亮”了出来，请领导和同志们对我批评帮助。
    这件事给了我很深的教育。油壶虽小，但它反映出我的思想改造还很不彻底。今后，我一定以雷锋、王杰为榜样，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。
