The fundamental reason is that I have studied Chairman Mao's works and have a golden sun in my heart.

The waters of the Qinghai Lake are deep and vast, originating from the high snow-capped mountains. The revolutionary spirit is high and mighty, coming from the great thought of Mao Zedong. The grass on the grasslands is green and lush, nourished by the earth. Our hearts are bright and clear, because they hold the golden sun.

Last year, the higher authorities awarded me a Tibetan version of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (Type B). From then on, I carried Chairman Mao's book with me every day, reading it while herding during the day and at night. Chairman Mao's words resonated deeply in my heart. The more I read Chairman Mao's book, the more I loved it, and the brighter my heart became.

Before winter, our brigade harvested over 50,000 catties of grass by the Qinghai Lake to prepare for winter fodder. The brigade asked me to take charge of bringing the grass back. I happily took on this heavy responsibility, driving the horse-drawn cart day and night, making six or seven trips a day, and loading and unloading the cart myself. After two days, I was exhausted with a sore back and legs. But when I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, my strength surged, and I completed the task in just six days. The brigade members wanted to give me work points, but I refused to take any.

In early March this year, the grasslands were hit by cold winds, and the new grass had just sprouted. The remaining winter grass was scarce, and the livestock were quite weak. Seeing this situation, I was very worried. I thought that I should, as Chairman Mao taught, be extremely responsible in my work. So, I took some dry food, drove the sheep to the Qinghai Lake to graze, and slept on the open grassland at night. The cold wind from the lake chilled me to the bone, making it hard to sleep. I thought of Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune. They endured countless hardships for the revolution and ultimately sacrificed their precious lives; I was herding sheep for the revolution, so why couldn't I overcome this bit of hardship and endure this bit of suffering? With this thought, my body gained boundless strength. The newly born lambs were cold, so I wrapped them in felt and coats and warmed them with my body. During the day, I carried the weakest lambs in my arms and backpack while herding the flock. I did everything I could to ensure that not a single lamb died, for every additional sheep would contribute more to the construction of socialism.

Thus, I endured the wind and rain, persisting by the lake for two whole months. The ten horses and over 170 sheep I herded all grew fat and strong, and the 70-plus lambs born were all lively and jumping. Seeing the public commune's livestock thrive, my heart was sweeter than honey.

    是什么力量使我能做到关心集体胜过关心自己？最根本的原因就是我学习了毛主席著作，
    心里装着金色的太阳
    共和县甲乙公社社员　拉兰加（藏族）西海的水哟深又广，来自高高的雪山顶上。革命的劲头哟高万丈，来自伟大的毛泽东思想。草原的草哟青又青，只因大地把它滋养。我们的心哟明又亮，只因装着金色的太阳。
    去年，上级奖给我一本藏文版的《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本。从此，我天天把毛主席的书揣在怀里，白天放牧的时候读，晚上也读。毛主席的话句句说在我的心坎上，毛主席的书我越读越爱读，越读心里越亮堂。
    入冬前，我们队在青海湖边拔了五万多斤草，准备作冬季饲料。队里要我负责把草拉回来，我高兴地挑起了这副重担子，赶着马车不分白天黑夜地拉，一天拉六、七回，还要自己装车卸车。拉了两天，就累得腰酸腿痛。但是，我一想起毛主席的教导，浑身的劲头就上来了，结果只用了六天时间就完成了任务。社员们要给我记工分，我一分也不要。
    今年三月初，草原上寒风阵阵，青草刚刚露头，队里剩下的冬草不多了，牲畜都比较瘦弱。我看到这种情况，非常着急。我想，应该像毛主席教导的那样，对工作极端负责任。于是，我就带上干粮，赶着羊群来到青海湖边放牧。晚上我睡在露天的草滩上。从湖上吹来的寒风透入骨髓，冻得睡不着。我就想起张思德、白求恩同志。他们为了革命，不仅历尽千辛万苦，而且最后献出了自己宝贵的生命；我也是为革命而放羊，难道这点困难都不能克服，这点苦都不能吃吗？想到这里，我的身上增添了无穷的力量。刚产下的羊羔怕冷，我就用毡子、皮袄把它们包起来，用自己的身体去温暖它们。白天，我把体质最弱的羊羔揣在怀里、背在背包里随群放牧。我想尽一切办法不让一只羊羔死掉，多一只羊就为社会主义建设多增加一分力量。
    就这样风里来雨里去，在湖边整整坚持了两个月。我放牧的十匹马和一百七十多只羊，都长得膘肥体壮，生下的七十多只羊羔个个活蹦乱跳。看着公社的牲畜长好了，我心里真比吃蜜还甜。
