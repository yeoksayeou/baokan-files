According to a report from the Central Meteorological Station, since October 4, many regions in North China, Central China, and Southwest China have received a beneficial rainfall for autumn sowing.

In the previous period, the drought was relatively severe in Henan and Hubei provinces, with a wide range of rainfall and relatively large amounts. In Henan, except for the eastern region where the rainfall was less than 10 millimeters, most areas received 10 to 20 millimeters of rain, with the highest amount in Nanyang District reaching 41 millimeters. Most areas in Hubei Province received 10 to 20 millimeters of rain, with the western region receiving 25 to 30 millimeters. The northwestern region of Hunan and most of Shanxi Province also received 5 millimeters and 10 to 20 millimeters of rain, respectively. Additionally, parts of Hebei in the west and north, Shaanxi, Shandong, Guizhou, and Inner Mongolia received less than 10 millimeters of light rain.

Currently, it is the peak season for autumn sowing, and this rainfall is very beneficial for improving the soil moisture in wheat fields. However, some drought-affected regions did not receive rain or had relatively little rain, and efforts must be made to continue with anti-drought sowing.

    华北中南西南许多地区普降喜雨有利当前秋播
    新华社六日讯　据中央气象台消息：十月四日以来，我国华北、中南和西南许多地区，降了一场对秋播很有利的喜雨。
    前一个时期旱情较重的河南、湖北两省降雨范围较广，雨量也较大。河南除东部地区降雨量不足十毫米外，大部地区降雨十到二十毫米，最多的南阳专区达四十一毫米。湖北省大部分地区降了十到二十毫米雨，西部地区降雨二十五到三十毫米。湖南西北部地区和山西大部分地区也分别降了五毫米、十毫米到二十毫米雨。另外，河北西部和北部，陕西、山东、贵州和内蒙古部分地区，都降了十毫米以下的小雨。
    目前，正是秋播的大忙时节，这场雨对增加麦田的墒情很有作用。但是有些受旱地区没有降雨或雨量较小，仍需要抓紧抗旱播种。
