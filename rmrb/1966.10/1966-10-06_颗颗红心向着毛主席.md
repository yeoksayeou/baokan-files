Chairman Mao is forever united with the hearts of the people. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, Chairman Mao's warm instructions, and Chairman Mao's great practices are deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people of Yan'an, in the hearts of the people of Changgang and Caixi, and in the hearts of all the people of the nation. Chairman Mao is always by our side, always caring for the people, and always guiding the people forward.

Every red heart forever turns to Chairman Mao. The sentiments of the people of Yan'an, the people of Changgang, and the people of Caixi are the sentiments of all the people of the nation. Chairman Mao's kindness is something we can never fully express. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought forever shines brightly. We have boundless love, boundless faith, and boundless admiration for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We will forever be loyal to the great Chairman Mao and forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

A ship sailing on the ocean needs a helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. Chairman Mao is our helmsman, and Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal red sun in our hearts. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution and forever march from victory to victory under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought!
