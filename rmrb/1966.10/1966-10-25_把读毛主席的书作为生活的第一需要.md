Editor's Note: The following are excerpts from the diaries of some comrades from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team. Every sentence and every word in these diaries come from the depths of the heroes' souls; every sentence and every word shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team are a new generation nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. They regard the study of Chairman Mao's works as the primary need of life, transform Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, turn the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, and consider revolutionary interests as their first priority. They are always ready to contribute everything for the cause of communism.

The heroes' words are heart-rending. They say: "I will always use Mao Zedong Thought to transform my own thoughts, constantly struggle against the 'I,' and resolve to be a revolutionary petroleum worker for life." They say: "My life is given by the Party, every cell in my body belongs to the Party.... I can give up everything, but I cannot give up the Party's interests." ... They say what they do, and their words and deeds are consistent. It is precisely because of this that they can withstand the most severe tests. In the struggle to find gas and oil for the motherland, they are pioneers; in the fight against raging fires, they are true gold; in the face of life-threatening injuries, they are tough men.

In the great era of Mao Zedong, the growth of all heroes is derived from Mao Zedong Thought. Lei Feng, Wang Jie, the people of Daqing, the people of Dazhai, and the heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team are all like this. To learn from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, one should, like them, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in one's mind, dissolve them in one's blood, and implement them in actions.

We firmly believe that by further instilling the great Mao Zedong Thought into workers and peasants, more heroic collectives and heroes like the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team will emerge nationwide.

Making the Study of Chairman Mao's Works the Primary Need of Life

Chairman Mao's words point the way for revolutionaries, Chairman Mao's books give revolutionaries boundless strength, and Chairman Mao's instructions give revolutionaries the most sublime and far-reaching ideals.

		— Zhang Yongqing

Chairman Mao's words are the words of the working people. Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences.

I feel stifled if I don't study Chairman Mao's works for a day. Picking up Chairman Mao's books, I feel spirited and full of strength.

To do revolutionary work well, one must first study Chairman Mao's works well. If one does not study for a day, one will not enjoy meals or sleep well.

		— Wang Ping

The most precious thing in the world is the sun, and what people need most is Mao Zedong Thought. We should, like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry out the Chinese and world revolutions to the end.

		— Luo Huatai

Chairman Mao's books are the highest directives for all work. After reading Chairman Mao's books, any difficulty can be overcome, and any human miracle can be created.

I follow Chairman Mao's words, and I can endure any pain; I act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and I can withstand any difficulty.

		— Deng Miquan

Studying a passage from Chairman Mao's works before work gives direction and strength for the day. If one does not study Chairman Mao's works for a day, one's thoughts will rust, and one will lack energy for work.

		— Wu Zhongqi

Mao Zedong Thought is the sun, shining wherever it goes. Wherever there is Mao Zedong Thought, work will improve every day. Acting according to Mao Zedong Thought will lead to success; otherwise, it will lead to failure, mistakes, and significant losses for the revolution. In the future, I will definitely study, delve into, and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently for the revolution.

		— Zhang Zhongmin

Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the working people. Chairman Mao's works are the most powerful weapons of struggle, the source of all strength. One can eat less and sleep less, but one cannot read Chairman Mao's books any less. After reading Chairman Mao's books, one can stand firm in a typhoon of twelve levels; in life-or-death situations, one remains calm and unperturbed. With Mao Zedong Thought, one can see through everything in any complex situation. Mao Zedong Thought will forever be our driving force.

		— Lei Hongbin

Whether or not to study Chairman Mao's works is a matter of stance, a matter of whether or not to be revolutionary. To be revolutionary, one must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Comrade Liao Chujian said: "Since Yu Gong can move mountains, why worry that theory cannot be mastered? With the resolve of Yu Gong moving mountains, step by step, climb the mountain of theory. To dig mountains, one needs picks and shovels; to study, one needs perseverance and diligence." These words have greatly inspired me. Previously, I often found it hard to study Chairman Mao's works, lacking perseverance; I always felt I had no time, lacking diligence. Time is in one's hands. To study well, one must have perseverance and diligence.

		— Wang Youfa

Every time I encounter a problem, I turn to Chairman Mao's works. I do as Chairman Mao says.

To do revolution, if one does not study Chairman Mao's works for a moment, revolutionary willpower will wane.

To become a communist warrior, one must, like Lei Feng, study Chairman Mao's works with insatiable hunger.

		— Huang Chenghou

### 把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要

专栏：

    编者按：这里发表的，是32111英雄钻井队一部分同志的日记摘抄。
    这些日记，每一句话，每一个字，都出自英雄们的灵魂深处；每一句话，每一个字，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    32111钻井队的英雄，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的一代新人。他们把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命利益当成第一生命。他们时刻准备着：为了共产主义的事业贡献出自己的一切。
    英雄们的语言是感人肺腑的。他们说：“我要时刻用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，不断地向‘我’字作斗争，决心为革命当一辈子石油工人。”他们说：“我的生命是党给的，我身上每一个细胞都是属于党的。……我能舍弃自己的一切，就是不能舍弃党的利益。”……他们说了就做，言行一致。正因为这样，他们才能经受得住最严重的考验。在为祖国找气找油的斗争中，他们是闯将；在和冲天的烈火搏斗时，他们是真金；在危及生命的伤痛面前，他们是硬汉。
    在伟大的毛泽东时代，一切英雄人物的成长，无一不是来源于毛泽东思想。雷锋、王杰是这样，大庆人、大寨人是这样，32111钻井队的英雄们也是这样。学习32111英雄钻井队，就应该像他们那样，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。
    我们深信：把伟大的毛泽东思想进一步灌输到工人农民中去，必将在全国涌现更多的32111英雄钻井队那样的英雄集体和英雄人物。
    把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要
  　毛主席的话给革命的人指出方向，毛主席的书给革命的人无穷力量，毛主席的指示给革命的人最崇高、最远大的理想。
                      ——张永庆
    毛主席的话是劳动人民的心里话。毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。
    我一天不学习毛主席著作，心里就憋得慌。拿起毛主席的书，就精神振奋，浑身是力量。
    要把革命工作干好，首先要把毛主席著作学好。如果一天不学习，就吃饭不甜，睡觉不香。
                      ——王平
    世界上最珍贵的是太阳，人最需要的是毛泽东思想。我们应该像雷锋、王杰一样，活学活用毛主席著作，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。
                    ——罗华太
    毛主席的书是一切工作的最高指示。读了毛主席的书，什么困难都可以克服，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    我听毛主席的话，再大的痛苦也能忍受；我按毛主席的教导去做，再大的困难也能经受得住。
                    ——邓木全
    上班前学习一段毛主席著作，一天的工作就有了方向，就有了力量。一天不学习毛主席著作，思想就要生锈，工作就没有劲头。
                                ——吴仲启
    毛主席思想是太阳，照到那里那里亮。那里有了毛主席思想，那里的工作就天天向上。按毛主席思想办事，就顺利，就成功；反之就失败，就犯错误，就给革命造成重大损失。今后，对毛主席著作，我一定要勤学、苦钻、狠用，为革命学，为革命钻，为革命用。
                                ——张仲珉
    毛泽东思想是我们劳动人民的命根子。毛主席著作是最强有力的战斗武器，是一切力量的源泉。饭可以少吃，觉可以少睡，毛主席的书可一点也不能少读。读了毛主席的书，在十二级台风里能站得住；在生死关头，面不改色，心不跳。有了毛泽东思想，在任何复杂情况下都能洞察一切。毛泽东思想永远是我们前进的动力。
                              ——雷洪炳
    学不学毛主席著作是立场问题，是革不革命的问题。要革命，就要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    廖初江同志说：“既然愚公能移山，何愁理论不能钻，立下愚公移山志，步步登上理论山，挖山要用镐和锹，学习要靠挤和钻。”这段话对我启发很大。以前我学习毛主席著作，常常学不进去，就是没有钻劲；总感到没有时间，就是没有挤劲。时间是靠人掌握的。要想学得好，就要有钻劲和挤劲。
                            ——王有发
    我每次碰到了问题，都要找毛主席著作，毛主席怎样说，我就怎样办。
    干革命，一时不学毛主席著作，革命意志就会衰退。
    要想成为一个共产主义战士，就必须像雷锋一样，如饥如渴地学习毛主席著作。
                            ——黄成厚
