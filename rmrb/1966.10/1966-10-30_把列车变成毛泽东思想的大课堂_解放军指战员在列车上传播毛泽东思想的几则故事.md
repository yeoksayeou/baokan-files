The People's Liberation Army's many units of officers and soldiers, when traveling, take it as their first task to propagate Mao Zedong Thought on the train, making Mao Zedong Thought occupy every aspect of the passengers' travel life. Passengers have composed such poems, enthusiastically praising the officers and soldiers who actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, singing the praises of these new events that occurred on the thousand-mile railway.

A Novel Performance Tour

Deputy Platoon Leader Li Yinshan was on a train from Baotou to Beijing. He happened to notice that there were many musical instruments on the luggage rack. Upon inquiry, he found out that they belonged to a performance troupe from Inner Mongolia. An idea flashed through his mind: "Wouldn't it be great to perform with the Inner Mongolia performance troupe on the train to propagate Mao Zedong Thought! This is also a good opportunity to learn from the Inner Mongolia performance troupe!" He discussed this with a few fellow soldiers on the train, and they all agreed. They then took the initiative to contact the troupe members. The members of the Inner Mongolia performance troupe, who took it as their duty to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, eagerly accepted Li Yinshan's suggestion. They excitedly took down the musical instruments from the luggage rack and began a novel performance tour with Li Yinshan and others on the train.

Li Yinshan took charge of the performance, giving an opening speech, and then announced the program: "The first item: Reciting Chairman Mao's quotations. Participants: All revolutionary comrades in the car. Please open to page 15 of 'Chairman Mao's Quotations'." With the command "Ready, go," the car was filled with the sound of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, drowning out the roar of the train: "After the armed enemies have been wiped out, the unarmed enemies still exist, and they will inevitably engage in a life-and-death struggle with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." They performed a few items and recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations. The car became a classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought, filled with a strong political atmosphere. Finally, everyone sang "The East Is Red" together, concluding the performance.

They toured from one car to the next, and wherever the performance troupe went, joy and excitement followed. When they toured to Car 6, they found a sick passenger. Fearing to disturb the patient, they thought of skipping this car. However, the passengers in this car would not agree. When Li Yinshan was explaining to everyone, the sick passenger propped himself up and said, "Go ahead with your performance. Listening to you propagate Mao Zedong Thought makes me feel good, and my illness will be reduced!" The performance troupe had to perform an extra show for Car 6. After the performance, the entire car was in an uproar, with the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!" echoing endlessly.

Learning the Sixteen Points with the Red Guards

"Everyone, shall I read the Sixteen Points for you?" Deputy Squad Leader Liu Yufu's resonant voice instantly quieted the car. "Good!" the Red Guards and passengers in the car responded in unison. Liu Yufu continued, "Let's first study a quotation from Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: 'Only when the Party's policies and strategies are all on the right track will the Chinese revolution have the possibility of victory. Policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the Party. All levels of leadership must fully pay attention and must not be careless.'" Liu Yufu read loudly, and the Red Guards echoed him. After reciting the quotation, he said, "Comrades, students, Red Guards, the Sixteen Points are the great program of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, personally drafted by our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao. To make the Cultural Revolution better, let's study the fifth point of the Sixteen Points together and resolutely carry out the Party's class line." The Red Guards enthusiastically applauded. As soon as Liu Yufu finished, another soldier took over, saying, "To better understand the spirit of this point, let's study the speeches given by Comrade Lin Biao and Premier Zhou at the reception of revolutionary teachers and students from other provinces, shall we?" Many Red Guards quickly took out newspapers and booklets containing the full text of the speeches, but some did not have these materials and became anxious. Liu Yufu quickly said, "Comrades, if there are not enough study materials, we can help solve some of the problems." He then took out a stack of small cards and distributed them to the passengers who lacked documents. It turned out that before boarding the train, they had anticipated such a problem and, to facilitate everyone's study, had written the main contents of Comrade Lin Biao and Premier Zhou's speeches on small cards and brought them along. The Red Guards immediately cheered, saying, "The PLA thinks of everything to propagate the Sixteen Points and Mao Zedong Thought!"

Model Behavior is the Most Powerful Propaganda

The train was speeding along the Jing-Jin line. A soldier from a certain unit, Qiu Shuren, dressed in a neat green military uniform, was busy on the train. He would sometimes hold "Chairman Mao's Quotations" and organize passengers to study with the Red Guards and train staff, and other times he would pour tea and sweep the floor, serving the passengers. Once, while pouring tea for the passengers, an unexpected incident occurred: he had just lifted the lid of the teacup when the train suddenly jolted, and a passenger bumped into him, causing the lid to fall and shatter. Qiu Shuren was about to go find the train staff to compensate for the damage. However, he thought that the train staff would not accept his compensation. What to do? He remembered that his platoon leader, Bi Changhong, was good at persuading people, so he took out five jiao and found the platoon leader, asking him to help complete this "task."

The platoon leader found the train staff and explained the situation, sincerely apologizing and taking out the money to compensate. The train staff, upon seeing this, smiled and waved his hand, saying, "You have been propagating Mao Zedong Thought and helping us with chores all the way, giving us the greatest support. Because the car shook, a teacup lid broke, how could we let you compensate?" Bi Changhong said, "Propagating Mao Zedong Thought and doing chores is what we should do. How can we be specially 'treated' just because we did a little work?" The two pushed and pulled, neither yielding. The train staff seriously said, "We train staff do not compensate for breaking a cup lid either. You helping us work is like being a volunteer train staff, and this cannot be an exception." Bi Changhong also seriously said, "Our Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention clearly state: 'Compensate for damaged items.'" The train staff took out a small notebook from his pocket and said, "We don't have this compensation rule here." Bi Changhong also took out his "Chairman Mao's Quotations" book, flipping to page 221, saying, "We have the clear regulation 'Compensate for damaged items,' which is the discipline personally given to us by Chairman Mao!" The train staff, seeing that he could not persuade the platoon leader, became anxious: "In any case, you have to listen to us on the train." Bi Changhong and Qiu Shuren could not persuade the train staff, so they put the money away and left. When the train arrived at Beijing Station, five jiao appeared under a cup in the train staff's room. The train staff immediately picked up the money and ran to the platform, but Bi Changhong and Qiu Shuren had already disappeared.

Many passengers praised, "The PLA's model behavior is the most powerful propaganda for Mao Zedong Thought!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    把列车变成毛泽东思想的大课堂
    ——解放军指战员在列车上传播毛泽东思想的几则故事
    “毛泽东思想是太阳，解放军战士把太阳带到列车上，他们把列车变成毛泽东思想的播种机，把列车办成毛泽东思想的大课堂。”人民解放军许多部队指战员外出的时候，在列车上把宣传毛泽东思想作为自己的第一任务，让毛泽东思想占领旅客旅行生活的一切阵地。旅客们编了这样的诗歌，热情赞扬积极传播毛泽东思想的指战员，传颂着这些发生在千里铁路线上的新事。
    别开生面的巡回演出
    副连长李银山乘车从包头到北京，偶尔发现行李架上放着许多乐器，一打听，原来是内蒙古的一支乌兰牧骑演出队带的。一个念头闪过他的脑海：“能和乌兰牧骑演出队一起在列车上宣传毛泽东思想该多好！这也是向乌兰牧骑学习的好机会呀！”他和同车的几位战友商量了一下，大家都同意，便主动和乌兰牧骑的队员们联系。以宣传毛泽东思想为己任的乌兰牧骑演出队的同志们，欣然接受了李银山的建议，他们兴奋地从行李架上取下乐器，同李银山等在车上开始了一场别开生面的巡回演出。
    李银山担任演出的指挥，他说了个开场白，然后就报节目：“第一个节目：朗读毛主席语录。参加者：车厢内全体革命同志。请打开《毛主席语录》第十五页。”随着“预备起”的口令，车厢里响起了朗读毛主席语录的声音，盖过了火车的轰鸣：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”他们演出几个节目，朗读一段毛主席语录。车厢成了学习毛泽东思想的课堂，政治空气浓浓的。最后，大家又齐声唱起《大海航行靠舵手》，结束了演出。
    他们一个车厢接一个车厢去巡回演出，演出队到那里，那里就出现欢乐的热潮。他们巡回到六号车厢时，发现车厢里有一位病人，因为怕干扰病人就想把这个车厢隔过去。谁知这个车厢的旅客不答应。李银山在给大家解释时，这位病人却从铺上欠起身来说：“你们演出吧。我听你们宣传毛泽东思想，心里畅快，病就能减轻！”演出队只得给六号车厢补演了一场。演出之后，整个车厢沸腾起来，“毛主席万岁，万万岁”的口号声经久不息。
    和红卫兵一起学十六条
    “大家听我念十六条，好不好！”副班长刘玉秀宏亮的声音一下子就使车厢静下来，“好！”车厢里的红卫兵和旅客同声回答。刘玉秀接着说：“咱们先学一段毛主席语录。毛主席说：‘只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。’”刘玉秀大声念，红卫兵们齐声和。念完语录，他接着说道：“同学们，红卫兵同志们，十六条是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的。为了把文化大革命搞得更好，咱们一起来学习十六条中的第五条，坚决执行党的阶级路线。”红卫兵们热烈鼓掌欢迎。刘玉秀一念完，另一位战士接上来说：“为了更好地领会这一条的精神，咱们再来学习林彪同志和周总理在接见外地革命师生大会上的几次讲话，好不好？”许多红卫兵很快拿出载有讲话全文的报纸和小册子，可是有一些人没有这些材料，着急起来了。刘玉秀连忙说：“同学们，学习材料不够用，我们可以帮助解决一些。”说罢拿出一叠小纸板，分发给缺少文件的旅客。原来他们在上车前，就估计到可能会碰到这样的问题，为了方便大家学习，就把林彪同志和周总理的几次讲话的主要内容，抄写在小纸板上，随身带着。红卫兵们立刻欢呼起来，说：“解放军为了宣传十六条，宣传毛泽东思想，想得真周到！”
    模范行动是最有力的宣传
    列车在京津线上飞驰。穿着整整齐齐草绿色军装的某部战士邱树仁，在车上忙个不停。他一会儿拿着《毛主席语录》，和红卫兵、列车员一起组织旅客们学习，一会儿，又倒茶扫地，为旅客们服务。一次，他在为旅客倒茶的时候，一件意外的事发生了：他刚揭起茶杯的瓷盖，不料列车猛地一震，有位旅客撞到他身上，瓷盖掉在地上，打了个粉碎。邱树仁准备立即去找列车员赔偿。可是他一想，列车员一定不会收他赔的钱。怎么办？他想起同行的班长毕长红善于说服人，就拿出五角钱，找到班长，请班长帮他完成这个“任务”。
    班长找到列车员说明情况，恳切地道了歉，拿出钱来赔偿。列车员一见笑着摆手说：“你们这一路上，一边宣传毛泽东思想，一边帮我们搞勤务，给了我们最大的支援。因为车子震动，打碎了个杯子盖儿，哪能让你们赔呢？”毕长红说：“宣传毛泽东思想，做勤务，这是我们应当做的。怎么能因为我们做了一点工作就特殊‘照顾’啊！”两个人推来让去，各不相让。列车员认真地说：“我们列车员不慎打了杯盖也是不赔偿的。你们帮我们工作就是义务列车员，这也不能例外。”毕长红也认真地说：“我们的三大纪律八项注意上写得清清楚楚：损坏东西要赔。”列车员从口袋里掏出一个小本本说：“我们这里没有这项赔钱规定啊。”毕长红也掏出了《毛主席语录》本，翻开第二百二十一页说：“我们这里却有‘损坏东西要赔’的明文规定，这是毛主席亲手给我们定的纪律！”列车员看说不服班长发了急：“反正你们在车上得听我们的。”毕长红和邱树仁实在无法说服列车员，就把钱收了起来走了。车到北京站，在列车员小屋的一只杯子下出现了五角钱。列车员马上拿起钱来追到站台上，可是，毕长红和邱树仁早跑得没影没踪了。
    许多旅客称赞说：“解放军的模范行动是最有力的宣传毛泽东思想！”　（新华社）
