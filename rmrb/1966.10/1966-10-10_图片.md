The workers of Daqing have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, relying on the two brilliant essays "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." They have overcome numerous difficulties and, through four years of hard work, built a first-class modern oil field in a desolate, uninhabited grassland. They have brought honor to the Party and the people! This is the victory performance by the Daqing Oil Field Workers' Family Amateur Troupe, "Victory Report of Daqing Workers."
