The broad masses of workers on the front lines of China's fertilizer industry have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried out thorough thought reform, and achieved new victories in fertilizer production. From January to September this year, the national fertilizer output increased by 37 percent compared to the same period last year. The quality of nitrogen fertilizers has remained stable, and the quality of phosphate fertilizers has improved. The consumption of electricity, raw materials, and materials has been universally reduced, and production costs have been lowered.

Workers on the fertilizer industry front lines have pointed out that these great achievements are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since the beginning of this year, fertilizer factories across the country have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. Especially during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, with deep class feelings, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in the midst of struggle. The broad masses of workers have used Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful and sharpest weapon, to launch a fierce attack on the capitalist roaders in power within the Party and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, breaking all old rules and customs that hinder the development of productive forces and further liberating productive forces. The broad masses of workers dare to think, dare to do, and dare to make revolution, and in a short period of time, have created many new technologies, new processes, new equipment, and new products. Several new types of catalysts that have been put into production are examples of this.

Since the beginning of this year, the broad masses of workers on the fertilizer industry front lines have loudly put forward the slogan of using the same types and quantities of raw materials to produce more and better fertilizers for the state to support agriculture. The main fertilizer factories across the country have saved nearly 200,000 tons of coal and white coal in the production of synthetic ammonia this year, which can be used to increase fertilizer production.

    活学活用毛主席著作促进人的思想革命化
    我国化肥工业大幅度增产
    一月到九月的化肥产量比去年同期增长百分之三十七
    据新华社南京十六日电　我国化肥工业战线广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大搞思想革命化，推动化肥生产取得了新胜利。今年一到九月，全国化肥产量，比去年同期增长百分之三十七。氮肥的质量稳定，磷肥的质量提高。电力、原料、材料的消耗普遍下降，生产成本降低。
    化肥工业战线职工们指出，这一巨大成就的取得，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命开的花，结的果。今年以来，各地化肥厂都把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。尤其是在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，广大职工怀着无比深厚的阶级感情，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。广大职工运用毛泽东思想这个最强大最锐利的武器，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动
  “权威”猛烈开火，破除一切阻碍生产力发展的旧规陋习，进一步解放了生产力。广大职工敢想敢干敢革命，在短时期内创造了许多新技术、新工艺、新设备、新产品。已经用于生产的几种新型触媒产品，就是这样创造出来的。
    化肥工业战线广大职工今年以来，响亮地提出用同样品种、同样数量的原料材料，为国家增产更多更好的化肥支援农业的口号。全国主要化肥厂今年以来生产合成氨节约的焦炭和白煤，可以用来增产近二十万吨化肥。
