In September, American reporters, under the cover of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, repeatedly entered the "refugee camp" in Medan, Indonesia, to produce anti-China propaganda materials. Thousands of overseas Chinese, driven from Aceh by the Indonesian government to Medan, bravely fought against the Americans to defend the dignity and honor of their motherland. Thousands of injured overseas Chinese, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, united as one, and drove the provocative Americans away in disarray.

No Photos Allowed for Americans!

At around 11 a.m. on September 13, an American reporter, accompanied by an Indonesian "reporter," sneaked into the dormitory of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, which had been seized by Indonesian reactionaries and was now used as a "refugee camp." The American, full of arrogance, raised his camera to take pictures of the suffering overseas Chinese who were eating. A young overseas Chinese noticed this and immediately shouted, "Hey! No photos here!" The American was startled by the shout, put down his camera, and stared at the young man in disbelief. At this moment, the overseas Chinese surged forward like a tide. An overseas Chinese who recognized the American shouted, "He is a reporter from The New York Times, don't be fooled!"

Upon hearing that it was an American, the anger of the overseas Chinese flared up. Thousands of fists were raised high, and the angry slogans of "Down with American Imperialism" echoed throughout the "camp." The American was terrified by the crowd and could no longer keep his composure. He quickly turned and fled.

That evening at around 8:30 p.m., the American returned. As soon as he was spotted, the people immediately surged out from the dormitories and dining halls to keep an eye on him. To prevent the American from taking photos, the overseas Chinese turned off the lights in the dining hall. The angry shouts of "Americans get out!" and "Down with American Imperialism" resonated once again. At this moment, the Indonesian soldiers guarding the "camp" rushed out with guns, shouting loudly in an attempt to stop the overseas Chinese from chanting slogans. However, the slogans continued to shake the night sky. "Bang!" An Indonesian soldier fired a shot into the air. But the slogans of "Down with American Imperialism and its running dogs" became even louder.

The American had no choice but to slink away.

Arrogant Upon Arrival, Cowardly Upon Departure

At 9:30 a.m. on September 14, a jeep stopped in front of the dormitory of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School. Five or six armed Indonesian soldiers jumped out of the car, standing on high alert. The same American, under the protection of an Indonesian lieutenant, strutted in arrogantly. The overseas Chinese closely watched their movements. Wherever they went, the people followed. When they reached the place where the overseas Chinese stored their luggage, the American suddenly stopped. To obtain deceptive anti-China materials for world opinion, he raised his camera again. At this moment, some overseas Chinese raised their arms, some held up chairs, and some held up basins, blocking the American's camera lens. Just as the Indonesian soldiers were pushing and pulling the overseas Chinese, the injured overseas Chinese could no longer contain their anger. People shouted and surged forward, some climbed onto tables to block the American's view, and some rushed forward to seize the camera. "Americans get out!" "Down with Neocolonialism!" Along with the slogans, the children of the overseas Chinese also rushed forward, grabbing the American's camera. The representative of the overseas Chinese immediately lodged a strong protest with the Indonesian military officer. When the Indonesian military officer rudely rejected the protest, the slogans became even louder. The overseas Chinese questioned the American, "Which country are you from?" This American shamelessly lied, "I am French, I am here for a visit!" After saying this, he jumped into the jeep and slinked away.

Let Me Hit Him with My Cane

On the same morning at around 12 p.m., the shameless American rushed to the "refugee camp" in Batam, which was originally a tobacco drying room. The American met with resistance here as well. The overseas Chinese, young and old, men and women, formed a human wall at the entrance of the "camp," hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder. An elderly overseas Chinese woman with a cane pushed her way into the crowd, saying, "Let me hit the American with my cane!" Seeing this scene, the American did not even dare to get out of the car and quickly drove away.

On September 18, the overseas Chinese in the "refugee camp" of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School received a notice from the Indonesian military that the commander of the Second Military District, Subianto, would be coming for an inspection and that the overseas Chinese should make preparations to "welcome" him. At 3:30 p.m. that afternoon, more than ten armed Indonesian soldiers got out of the car and began patrolling and guarding the open space in the dormitory. At this moment, an overseas Chinese discovered three Americans and several Indonesian police officers in the windows of the second floor of the school building, and also noticed another window covered with cloth that had a shiny object, which turned out to be the Americans secretly filming. At this moment, an American, accompanied by an Indonesian military officer and an Indonesian "reporter," barged into the dormitory. It turned out that it was not the commander of the Second Military District coming for an inspection, but a deliberate deception of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese decided to first negotiate with the Indonesian military officer, demanding that the Americans stop filming and leave immediately. The negotiations failed, and the overseas Chinese angrily shouted, "Americans get out! If you don't leave, we will take action immediately!" The Americans and the Indonesian military officer still did not listen, so the overseas Chinese angrily threw stones at the window on the second floor where the film camera was hidden. The Americans were panicked and quickly fled with their heads covered. At this moment, a Kuomintang spy came out from a coffee stall set up in the corner of the dining hall, barking, "It's okay, let them take pictures!" This spy was under the protection of the Indonesian reactionaries, using the sale of coffee as a cover to monitor the injured overseas Chinese. The injured overseas Chinese immediately shouted, "Down with the Kuomintang spies!" This Kuomintang spy was beaten black and blue by the overseas Chinese on the spot, and his coffee stall was smashed to pieces.

Angry Shouts Drowned Out Gunshots

At around 10 a.m. on September 20, two American reporters, protected by more than twenty armed Indonesian police officers, once again came to the Overseas Chinese Middle School. As soon as the Americans entered the gate, they raised their cameras and began taking pictures hastily. The overseas Chinese had already made their preparations. They bravely fought back against the blatant provocation of the Americans and the Indonesian reactionaries. "Hit them! Hit them hard! Kill the Americans!" Along with the angry shouts, stones, fruit pits, slippers, and anything else within reach were thrown at the Americans.

At this moment, the Indonesian soldiers fired hundreds of shots into the air to suppress the situation. However, the gunshots could not frighten the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The songs "The East Is Red" and "Unity Is Strength," along with the slogans "Down with the Americans," "Long Live the Motherland," and "Long Live Chairman Mao," drowned out the dense gunfire of the Indonesian reactionaries.

The Indonesian people stood on the side of the injured overseas Chinese. They supported the patriotic and just struggle of the overseas Chinese in whatever way they could. A guard of the Medan "refugee camp" said excitedly to the injured overseas Chinese after they drove away the Americans five times, "You have won!"

    受害华侨怒逐美国佬
    九月份，美国记者在印度尼西亚右派反动势力的掩护下，一再到印度尼西亚棉兰的难侨“收容所”制造反华宣传材料。被印度尼西亚政府从亚齐地区赶到棉兰的数千名受害华侨，为了捍卫祖国的尊严和荣誉，面对面地同美国佬进行了英勇的斗争。那里的数千名受害华侨，用毛泽东思想武装起来，团结一致，把前来挑衅的美国佬打得狼狈而逃。
    不准美国佬照相！
    九月十三日上午十一时许，一名美国记者由一名印度尼西亚“记者”陪同，鬼鬼祟祟地闯进被印度尼西亚反动派霸占后现在作为难侨“收容所”的棉兰市华侨中学宿舍。美国佬得意洋洋地举起照相机，对着正在吃饭的受难侨胞拍照。一位难侨青年发现后，马上大喝一声：“喂！不准在这里拍照！”美国佬被这一喝声吓得放下了相机，望着这个青年发呆。这时，难侨们像潮水般涌过来。一位熟悉这个美国佬的难侨喊道：“他是《纽约时报》的记者，千万别上当！”
    一听说是美国佬，难侨们心中的怒火就燃烧起来。千百只拳头高高举起，“打倒美帝国主义”的愤怒口号声，响彻了整个
  “收容所”。美国佬被愤怒的人群吓呆了，他再也沉不住气，马上扭身溜了出去。
    这天晚上八时多，这个美国佬又来了。他一被发现，人们立即像潮水一样从宿舍、饭堂里涌出来监视他。为了不让美国佬拍照，难侨们把饭厅里的电灯关掉了。“美国佬滚蛋”“打倒美帝国主义”的怒吼声再一次震响起来。这时，看守“收容所”的印度尼西亚军人提着枪从哨岗上冲了出来，并且大声狂喊，妄图制止难侨喊口号。可是，口号声继续震撼着夜空。“呯！”印度尼西亚军人竟然向空中开了一枪。但是，“打倒美帝国主义和它的走狗”的口号声却变得更加响亮。
    这个美国佬不得不夹起尾巴滚蛋了。
    气汹汹而来，灰溜溜而走　
    九月十四日上午九时半，一辆吉普车停在棉兰华侨中学宿舍门前，五六名印度尼西亚武装军人从车上跳下来，如临大敌地紧急戒备。又是那个美国佬在一名印度尼西亚中尉军官的保护下，耀武扬威地走了进来。难侨们密切地注视着他们的行动。他们走到哪里，人们就围到哪里。走到难侨存放行李的地方，美国佬一下站住，他为了摄取欺骗世界舆论的反华材料，又把照相机举了起来。这时，有的难侨举起手臂，有的扛起凳子，有的端起脸盆，团团把美国佬的相机镜头挡住。正当印度尼西亚军人推拉难侨的时候，受害侨胞们再也按不住胸中的怒火，人们高呼着一拥而上，有的跳上桌子挡住美国佬的视线，有的冲上去夺取照相机。“美国佬滚出去！”“打倒尼哥林（新殖民主义的意思）！”随着口号声，难侨的孩子们也冲上去扯住美国佬的相机不放。难侨代表当场向印度尼西亚军官提出了强烈抗议。当印度尼西亚军官横蛮拒绝抗议的时候，口号声更高地响起来。难侨们质问美国佬：“你究竟是哪国人？”这个美国佬竟然无赖地撒谎说：“我是法国人，是来游历的！”说完钻进吉普车灰溜溜地溜走了。
    让我用拐杖揍他几下
  　同日上午十二时左右，无耻的美国佬又赶到巴烟的难侨“收容所”，这里原来是烤烟房。美国佬在这里又碰了壁，难侨男女老少在“收容所”门前手挽手、肩并肩，形成一道人墙。有个华侨老大娘拄着拐杖挤进队伍，她说：“让我用拐杖揍美国佬几下！”美国佬看到这场面，连车也不敢下，倒过车来就跑了。
    九月十八日，华侨中学难侨“收容所”的侨胞们接到印度尼西亚军方通知，说是第二军区司令苏比兰要来视察，要难侨们作好“欢迎”准备。这天下午三时半，十几名印度尼西亚武装军人一下汽车，就在宿舍的空地上警戒巡逻。这时，有个难侨发现校舍二楼窗口上出现了三个美国佬和几个印度尼西亚宪兵的身影，同时发现另一个用麻布罩着的窗口有种发亮的镜子，原来是美国佬在偷偷摸摸地拍电影。这时，一个美国佬在一名印度尼西亚军官和一名印度尼西亚“记者”的陪同下，闯进宿舍来。原来，并不是什么第二军区司令来视察，而是故意对难侨们进行欺骗。难侨们决定先向印度尼西亚军官进行交涉，要求美国佬停止在这里偷拍电影，并立即滚蛋。交涉无效，侨胞们就愤怒地呼喊：“美国佬滚蛋！不滚蛋，我们立即采取行动！”美国佬和印度尼西亚军官仍然不听，侨胞们就愤怒地向二楼上藏着电影机的窗口掷石块。美国佬慌了手脚，急忙抱头逃走。这时，一个蒋帮特务分子从设在饭厅一边的咖啡摊里钻了出来狂吠：“不要紧，让他们拍照！”这个特务是在印度尼西亚反动派的保护下，以卖咖啡为名来监视受害华侨的。受害华侨们立即响起了“打倒蒋帮特务”的怒吼声，这个蒋帮特务当场被难侨们打得鼻青脸肿，他的咖啡摊也被难侨们打得粉碎。
  　　怒吼声压倒枪声
  　九月二十日上午十时许，两个美国记者在二十多名荷枪实弹的印度尼西亚宪兵的保护下，再次来到华侨中学。美国佬一进大门，就端起照相机，急急忙忙拍摄起来。难侨们早已做好了准备，敌人敢来挑衅，就要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。他们对美国佬和印度尼西亚反动派明目张胆的挑衅行为进行了英勇的抗击。“打！狠狠地打！打死美国佬！”随着愤怒的喊声，石块、果核、拖鞋，凡是随手能够拿到的东西都一起向美国佬飞去。
    这时，印度尼西亚军人竟然对空发射了数百发子弹进行镇压。但是枪声吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中华儿女，《大海航行靠舵手》、《团结就是力量》的歌声和“打倒美国佬”“祖国万岁”“毛主席万岁”的口号声，压倒了印度尼西亚反动派的密集枪声。
    印度尼西亚人民站在受害侨胞的一边。他们用可能做到的方式支持华侨的爱国正义斗争。看守棉兰难侨“收容所”的一个印度尼西亚军人，在侨胞们五次赶走美国佬以后激动地对受害侨胞们说：“你们胜利了！”　（据新华社湛江十一日电）
