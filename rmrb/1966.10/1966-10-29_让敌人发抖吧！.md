A loud explosion, shaking the five continents, the hearts of seven hundred million people surged like waves, everyone rushed to tell each other, "Good news, good news—our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch was successful!"

How exciting, how thrilling! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the latest fruit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and another great example of our people's self-reliance and striving for strength.

What a powerful blow it is to the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail by the U.S. and Soviet collusion! What strong support it is to our heroic Vietnamese brothers who are fighting against U.S. aggression and for national salvation! What a great encouragement it is to the revolutionary people of the world! What a great contribution it is to the defense of world peace!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We are advocates of the annihilation of war, we do not want war; but we can only annihilate war through war, and we must pick up the gun to refuse to pick up the gun." Faced with the fact that U.S. imperialism is desperately developing nuclear weapons, carrying out nuclear blackmail, and invading everywhere, how can we not adopt self-defense measures and conduct necessary and limited nuclear tests? Our ultimate goal in developing nuclear weapons is precisely to eliminate nuclear weapons.

"The successful launch of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test!" This is the biggest, newest, and best news. All the revolutionary and peace-loving people of the world will surely applaud and celebrate this news with all their hearts.

The U.S. imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries will surely tremble with fear and shake all over when they hear this news. Let them rage, let them have hysterics! All of this is futile and cannot save them from the failure of their nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail; it cannot cover up their inner panic and emptiness. The success of our Chinese people's missile and nuclear weapon test launch has left you speechless. Tell you, we Chinese people have an invincible spiritual atomic bomb—Mao Zedong Thought, and one after another even greater victories that will make you tremble with fear. Wait and see!

Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!

    让敌人发抖吧！
    北京有线电厂工人　孙有纯
    一声巨响，震动五洲，七亿人民的心好似波涛翻腾，人人奔走相告：“好消息，好消息——我国发射导弹核武器试验成功！”
    多么令人兴奋啊，多么叫人激动！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的光辉结晶，这是活学活用毛主席著作的最新成就，这是我国人民自力更生、奋发图强的又一伟大例证。
    它对美苏勾结实行核垄断、核讹诈，是一个多么有力的打击，对正在进行着抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南兄弟又是一个有力的支援！它对全世界革命人民是一个莫大的鼓舞，对保卫世界和平是一个巨大贡献！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们是战争消灭论者，我们是不要战争的；但是只能经过战争去消灭战争，不要枪杆子必须拿起枪杆子。”面对着美帝国主义拚命发展核武器，进行核讹诈，到处侵略的事实，我们怎能不采用自卫的手段，进行必要而有限制的核试验呢？我们发展核武器的最终目的正是为了消灭核武器。
    “我国发射导弹核武器试验成功！”这是一则最大最新最好的消息。全世界革命的爱好和平的人民听到这则新闻一定会拍手称快，衷心庆贺。
    美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派听到这则新闻则会胆颤心惊，浑身发抖。让他们去狂怒吧，让他们去歇斯底里大发作吧！这些都是无济于事的，一点也挽救不了他们核垄断、核讹诈失败的命运；一点也掩盖不了他们内心的恐慌和空虚。我们中国人民发射导弹核武器试验成功，叫你们目瞪口呆。告诉你们，我们中国人民有威力无比的精神原子弹——毛泽东思想，还有一个接一个的更大的新胜利，叫你们胆颤心惊的。你们等着吧！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
