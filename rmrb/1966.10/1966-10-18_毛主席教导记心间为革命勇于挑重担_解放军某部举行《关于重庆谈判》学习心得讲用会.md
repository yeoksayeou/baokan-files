To commemorate the 21st anniversary of Chairman Mao's "On the Talks at Chongqing," active members and some soldiers of a certain unit in the People's Liberation Army held a meeting to share their learning experiences. The theme of the meeting was "Chairman Mao's Teachings Are Always in Our Hearts: Carrying the Heavy Burden for the Revolution." Below are the speeches of six comrades.

Soldier Wei Shanming said:

Carrying the Heavy Burden for the People, the Harder the Place, the More We Should Go

I have been in the army for less than a year, and the leadership transferred me from the infantry to be a driver. When I heard this, I felt a chill. I thought, "If I don't go, it's an order, and I have to obey; if I go, I'll be dealing with animals all day, it's dirty and tiring, and there's no future." I brought this thought to my study of "On the Talks at Chongqing." Chairman Mao said, "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, see if we dare to take it on. Burdens are light and heavy. Some people pick the light ones and push the heavy ones to others, this is not a good attitude." Chairman Mao's words seemed to be speaking directly to me. As I read, I felt my face burning. I thought, the heavy burden is the greatest interest of the people. The people need me to be a driver, if I don't go, is this the attitude towards the revolution? So, I made up my mind to be a driver for the revolution and happily accepted the leadership's decision.

After becoming a driver, I followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "We are working and struggling to solve difficulties." I humbly learned from the old drivers, and I took on the dirtiest and hardest work, the more I did, the more enthusiastic I became. From this experience, I deeply felt that carrying the heavy burden for the people is the most happy and promising thing.

Class Leader Zhang Hancheng said:

Carrying the Heavy Burden, Strategically We Must Contempt Difficulties, Tactically We Must Respect Difficulties

At the beginning of this year, the organization assigned me to be the class leader of the second class. The second class had not been rated as a model class for four consecutive years, and there were many problems. Before I went to the second class, the political instructor repeatedly instructed me, "This is a heavy burden, you must work hard to carry it!" At this time, I studied "On the Talks at Chongqing," and from Chairman Mao's teachings on struggling against difficulties and carrying the heavy burden, I was inspired. After going to the second class, I worked hard and grabbed every opportunity to improve. However, the class's appearance did not change much. What was the reason? I studied "On the Talks at Chongqing" again. Chairman Mao said, "Some comrades do not want to think about difficulties. But difficulties are facts, we must acknowledge as many as there are, we cannot adopt the 'non-acknowledgment' attitude. We must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and struggle against difficulties." Comparing myself with Chairman Mao's teachings, I lacked this scientific analysis attitude, underestimated the difficulties, lacked serious analysis, so although my enthusiasm was great, I did not grasp the key points, and the work was not done well. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I and the classmates analyzed the reasons, found the key points, and focused on the problems in the class. We vigorously promoted the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasized politics, and achieved ideological revolutionization. Since then, the entire class's appearance has greatly improved, and in the initial evaluation, it has been rated as a model class. From this, I felt that to carry the heavy burden of the revolution, we must first have the courage to contemn difficulties and dare to win. But just having courage is not enough, we must also have a scientific analysis attitude. In specific problems, we must respect difficulties, seriously analyze difficulties, and take different measures for different problems. Only in this way can we truly carry the heavy burden of the revolution and carry it well.

Five Good Soldier, Class Leader Qi Guocheng said:

Carrying the Heavy Burden, We Must Fully Mobilize the Masses and Rely on the Masses

Last year during the field training, the deputy class leader of the fourth class was not present, and the company assigned me to act as the class leader. During the arduous field training, although I took on the hardest work, I did not bring all the classmates along. Some comrades were afraid of difficulties and tiredness, and were frightened by the difficulties. I brought this problem and reviewed "On the Talks at Chongqing." Chairman Mao taught us, "The affairs of China must be handled by the Communist Party and the people.... As long as we unite with all the people better, the affairs of China will be easy to handle."

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I cared for the comrades politically and in life. I fully played the role of the class cadres, mobilized the enthusiasm of every comrade, and everyone competed to carry the heavy burden during the march. Because the masses were mobilized, everyone's morale was high. In the arduous thousand-mile march and the hundred-mile raid, no one fell behind, no one complained of tiredness, and the field training task was successfully completed. The comrades' ideological awareness was greatly improved. At the end of the year, our class was rated as a model class. This event made me deeply feel that to carry the heavy burden of the revolution, we must fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. An individual's strength is limited, but the masses' strength is limitless. Only by mobilizing the masses, everyone competing to carry the heavy burden, can we do all the work well, and our cause can develop rapidly.

Soldier Cao Yanping said:

Daring to Carry the Heavy Burden Reflects Two Different Worldviews, Using Which Ideology to Guide Carrying the Heavy Burden Also Reflects Two Different Worldviews

In the past, I carried the "heavy burden" with personal motives. I often did not rest when running the club, and I worked hard on sideline production. I always volunteered for duties. I thought, this way, I can not only get training but also get the leadership's praise and the comrades' approval. Because I carried the "heavy burden" with a "selfish" motive, so I did not want to do things that did not get praise.

Later, I repeatedly studied "On the Talks at Chongqing." Chairman Mao taught us, "Let others enjoy, take the heavy burden, suffer first, and enjoy later. Such comrades are good comrades." Comparing myself, do I count as the good comrade Chairman Mao mentioned? I answered myself: I do not. Although I competed to carry some heavy burdens, I was calculating for myself, this is not a complete and thorough revolutionary ideology.

After the struggle in my thoughts, I realized: carrying the heavy burden with a "selfish" motive, the more you carry, the lower your ideological awareness, and the heavier your personal motives. Only by carrying the heavy burden with a "public" motive, everything from the revolutionary interests, everything from the people's interests, can you carry more and more enthusiastically, and your ideological awareness will be higher and higher. I followed Chairman Mao's teachings, overcame personal motives, and truly established the ideology of carrying the heavy burden for the revolution.

Deputy Class Leader Xuan Enhui said:

Carrying the Heavy Burden Should Not Be Divided into Official and Unofficial Duties

I am the deputy class leader. In the past, I always thought there was a class leader, so I pushed what I could to him. When I saw that many comrades in the company saw work and rushed to do it, I thought, why can they do this, and why can't I? I brought this problem and studied Chairman Mao's "On the Talks at Chongqing." Chairman Mao taught us, "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties." Chairman Mao's words inspired me greatly. I realized that the work we do is revolutionary work, and the burden we carry is a revolutionary burden. Revolutionary work has no boundaries, doing revolution has no distinction between you and me, no distinction between main and deputy, and no distinction between official and unofficial duties. Where there are difficulties and problems that need to be solved, we should actively do it and do it well. From then on, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings, actively assisted the class leader in doing the class's political and ideological work, organized the class to study Chairman Mao's works, often had heart-to-heart talks with the comrades, carried out ideological mutual assistance, and as long as it was beneficial to the revolution, I worked hard.

Soldier Chen Jiasen said:

Arming the Mind with Mao Zedong Thought, Firmly Carrying the Heavy Burden of World Revolution to the End

After joining the army, I felt that military life was too tense and the work was too hard, and I was not willing to work in the army. Later, I brought this problem and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "On the Talks at Chongqing." Chairman Mao said, "There is no straight road in the world, be prepared to walk a winding road, do not be greedy for convenience. Do not imagine that one morning, all reactionaries will kneel on the ground. In short, the future is bright, the road is winding." I thought repeatedly: yes, revolution is to struggle against difficulties, to suffer, to be prepared to walk some winding roads, to be greedy for convenience, and to be afraid of suffering is not to do revolution. The proletarian dictatorship needs to be defended, the oppressed and exploited people in the world need to be liberated, imperialism needs to be buried, who will carry this burden? It is us! It is the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the revolutionary people of the whole world. We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era, we carry the hope of the people of the world on our shoulders, our responsibility is to carry the world revolution to the end. After thinking through these reasons, my courage came.

Since then, Chairman Mao's teachings have firmly taken root in my heart. The harder the work, the more I rushed to do it, and I connected every piece of work I did with the world revolution.

From practice, I deeply felt that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the source of our strength to carry the heavy burden. With Mao Zedong Thought armed in our minds, we fear nothing, and we can carry any heavy burden. In the future, I am determined to read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform my soul, fear no hardship, fear no death, face difficulties, be in the company, have the country in mind, and look at the world, and swear to carry the heavy burden of the world revolution to the end!

    毛主席教导记心间为革命勇于挑重担
    ——解放军某部举行《关于重庆谈判》学习心得讲用会
    为纪念毛主席《关于重庆谈判》发表二十一周年，人民解放军某部连队学习毛主席著作积极分子和部分战士，以“毛主席教导记心间，为革命勇于挑重担”为主题举行了讲用会。下面是六位同志的发言。
    战士韦善明说：
    为人民挑重担子，越是困难的地方越是要去
    入伍不到一年，领导上把我从步兵连调出来去当驭手。我一听，心里凉了半截子。心想，不去吧，这是“命令”，要服从；去吧，整天跟牲口打交道，又脏、又累，没啥前途。我带着这个思想问题学习了《关于重庆谈判》。毛主席说：“艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”毛主席的这些话，好像完全是针对我说的，我读着读着，脸上感到火辣辣的。我想，重担子就是人民最大利益的需要，人民需要我去当驭手，我不去，难道这是对待革命的态度吗？于是，我下定决心，为革命当驭手，愉快地服从了领导上的决定。
    当了驭手以后，我遵照毛主席“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的”的教导，虚心地向老驭手学习，平时越是脏、越是累的工作，我越是抢着去干，而且越干越起劲。从这段经历中，使我深深体会到：为人民争着担重担子，是最幸福，最有前途的。
    班长张汉成说：
    挑重担子，在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难
    今年年初，组织上调我到二班当班长。二班连续四年没有评上四好，问题比较多。我到二班以前，指导员一再嘱咐我说：“这是一副重担子，你可要使把劲挑起来啊！”这时，我学习了《关于重庆谈判》，从毛主席关于向困难作斗争、挑重担子的教导中得到了鼓舞。到二班以后，我就使劲干，使劲抓，一天到晚干得满热火。但是，班里的面貌改进还是不大。到底是什么原因呢？我再次学习《关于重庆谈判》，毛主席说：“有些同志不愿意多想困难。但是困难是事实，有多少就得承认多少，不能采取‘不承认主义’。我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”对照毛主席著作检查自己，我就是缺乏这种科学分析态度，对困难估计不足，缺乏认真的分析，因此干劲虽然很大，但没有抓到要害上，工作没有做到点子上。遵照毛主席的教导，我和班里同志们分析了原因，找到了关键，针对班里存在的问题，狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出政治，实现思想革命化。从此，全班的面貌大大改变，在初评中已被评为四好班。从这里，我体会到，要挑起革命的重担子，首先必须有勇气，要敢于藐视困难，敢于胜利。但光有勇气还不够，还必须有科学分析的态度，在具体问题上，重视困难，认真分析困难，针对不同问题，采取不同的办法，这样，才能把革命的重担子真正挑起来，挑得好。
    五好战士、班长祁国成说：
    挑重担子，必须充分发动群众，依靠群众
    去年野营时，四班正副班长都不在，连里调我到四班去代理班长。在艰苦的野营途中，尽管我专拣最艰苦的工作干，但是并没有把班里的同志都带起来，有的同志畏难怕苦，被困难吓住了。我带着这个问题，重温了《关于重庆谈判》，毛主席教导我们：“中国的事情，要靠共产党办，靠人民办。……只要我们同全体人民更好地团结起来了，中国的事情就好办了。”
    我遵循毛主席的教导，从政治上关心同志，生活上照顾同志。充分发挥班里骨干的作用，调动每个同志的积极因素，大家在行军途中互相关心，互相鼓励，个个争着挑重担。由于群众发动起来了，大家情绪很高。在艰苦的千里行军中，在百里奔袭途中，无一掉队，无一叫累，圆满地完成了野营任务，同志们的思想觉悟都有了很大的提高。年终我们班被评为四好班。这件事使我深刻地体会到，要挑起革命的重担，必须充分发动群众，依靠群众。个人的力量是有限的，群众的力量是无限的。只有把群众都发动起来，大家都争着挑重担子，我们的一切工作才能搞好，我们的事业就能迅速发展。
    战士曹焰屏说：
    敢不敢挑重担子是两种世界观的反映，用什么思想作指导去挑重担子，也是两种世界观的反映
    过去，我是带着私心杂念去挑“重担子”。搞俱乐部常常不肯休息，搞副业生产也很努力，公差勤务总是抢着去。我想，这样做，不仅可以得到锻炼，还可以受到领导上的表扬，得到同志的好评。由于带着“私”字去挑“重担子”，所以，出了力就想“讨好”，所谓出力不讨好的事就不愿意干。
    后来，我反复学习了《关于重庆谈判》，毛主席教导我们：“享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”对照检查自己，我算不算得上毛主席说的好同志呢？我自己回答：算不上。我虽然争挑了一些重担子，但打的是个人的算盘，这不是完全、彻底的革命思想。
    经过思想斗争，我认识到：带着“私”字去挑重担子，越挑思想觉悟越低，私心杂念也越重。只有带着“公”字去挑重担子，一切从革命利益出发，一切从人民利益出发，才能越挑越有劲，越挑思想觉悟越高。我按照毛主席的教导，克服了私心杂念，才真正树立了为革命挑重担的思想。
    副班长宣恩辉说：
    挑重担子不能分份内份外
    我是副班长，过去干工作总觉得有班长，自己能推的就推。当我看到连里许多同志看见工作都抢着去干，我就想，他们为什么能够这样做呢！而我又为什么不能这样做呢！我带着这个问题学习了毛主席《关于重庆谈判》，毛主席教导我们说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”毛主席这段话给我的启发很大。我认识到，我们干的工作是革命工作，挑的担子是革命的担子。革命工作是没有界线的，干革命是没有你我之分、正副之分和份内份外之分的。那些地方有困难，有问题，需要我们去解决，我们就应该主动去干，把它干好。从此，我就照着毛主席的教导去办，平时我积极协助班长做好班里的政治思想工作，组织班里学习毛主席著作，经常和同志们谈心，开展思想互助，只要对革命有利的事情，我就拚命地干。
    战士陈家森说：
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑，坚定不移地把世界革命的重担挑到底
    参军后，我有一段时间感到部队生活太紧张，工作太艰苦，不安心在部队工作。后来我带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席《关于重庆谈判》，毛主席说：“世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜。不能设想，那一天早上，一切反动派会统统自己跪在地下。总之，前途是光明的，道路是曲折的。”我反复想：是啊，革命就要同困难作斗争，要吃苦，要准备走一些曲折的路，想贪便宜，害怕吃苦是干不了革命的。无产阶级政权要保卫，世界上被压迫受剥削的人民要解放，帝国主义要埋葬，这个担子靠谁去挑呢？就是要靠我们！靠广大工农兵，靠全世界革命的人民。我们是毛泽东时代的青年，我们肩上挑着世界人民的希望，我们的责任就是要将世界革命进行到底。想通了这些道理，我的勇气就来了。
    从那以后，毛主席的这一教导在我心中牢牢地扎下根。越是艰苦的工作，我越是抢着干，我把干的每件工作都同世界革命紧紧联系起来。
    从实践中，我深深体会到，伟大的毛泽东思想是我们挑重担子的力量源泉。用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，我们就什么都不怕，什么重担子都能挑。今后，我决心读一辈子毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想来改造灵魂，不怕苦，不怕死，迎着困难走，身在连队，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，誓把世界革命重担挑到底！
