The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, at the invitation of the Japan National Federation of Labor Music Associations and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, arrived in Tokyo on the evening of the 11th.

Japanese friends, including the Secretary-General of the "National Labor Music" Federation, Masano Hiroyuki, the Chairman of the Tokyo "Labor Music" Committee, Okamoto Hiro, the Secretary-General of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Shirakawa Go, the director of the Matsuyama Ballet, Matsuyama Juko, the director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Shimada Masao, and the director of the Japanese Folk Dance Troupe, Yamauchi Ryuichi, as well as representatives and activists from the National Labor Music, Tokyo Labor Music, Yokohama Labor Music, and Yokosuka Labor Music groups, totaling over 300 people, went to Haneda Airport to warmly welcome the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe. Also present at the airport to welcome them were the Chief Representative of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaozhi Office in Tokyo, Sun Pinghua, and the Vice Chairman of the Tokyo Chinese Association, Wu Puwen.

The waiting room at Haneda International Airport was filled with Japanese friends holding colorful bouquets and wreaths. Over 300 members of the Labor Music Association formed a long corridor with wreaths. As the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe passed through this corridor, the room echoed with the song "Tokyo-Beijing." Then, each member of the troupe was presented with a bouquet of flowers and a wreath, and the entire scene was filled with joy.

In his welcome speech, the Secretary-General of the National Labor Music Association, Masano, emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. We firmly oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and the Sato government's role as a lackey of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Asia. We will strive to build a Japan that is independent, democratic, and belongs to the people.

He said, "The revolutionary songs and dances of China will certainly inspire the struggle of the Japanese people." He concluded by wishing for the continuous strengthening of the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

In his speech, the Director of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, Wang Qian, emphasized, "Through this visit to Japan, the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe will introduce to the Japanese people the brilliant achievements of socialist literature and art in China under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and the struggles and lives of the Chinese people, past and present, to strengthen and develop cultural exchanges and fighting friendship between the two peoples."

Wang Qian pointed out, "U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, along with their various old and new followers, are trying every means to sabotage our friendly cause, but the China-Japan friendship movement has not only not been weakened or reduced, but has instead been strengthened and expanded."

He pointed out, "China-Japan friendship is an irresistible historical tide that no force can destroy." He concluded, "With the joint efforts of the peoples of China and Japan, the fighting friendship between the two peoples will continue to achieve new developments."

    中国革命歌舞定会鼓舞日本人民斗争
    北京歌舞团到东京受到日本朋友热烈欢迎
    据新华社十二日讯  东京消息：应日本全国勤劳者音乐协议会联络会议和日中文化交流协会的邀请，中国北京歌舞团十一日晚上到达东京。
    日本“全国劳音”事务局长牧野弘元、东京“劳音”委员长冈本弘、日中文化交流协会事务局长白土吾夫、松山芭蕾舞团松山树子、日中友协岛田政雄、日本民族歌舞团导演山内龙一以及全国劳音、东京劳音、横滨劳音、横须贺劳音等团体负责人和积极分子三百多人前往羽田机场热烈欢迎北京歌舞团。前往机场欢迎的还有，廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所首席代表孙平化、东京华侨总会副会长吴普文等。
    羽田国际机场的候机室里挤满了手持五彩缤纷的花束、花环的日本朋友。三百多名劳音会员用花环搭成了长廊，当北京歌舞团通过这个长廊时，场内响起一片《东京—北京》的歌声。接着，给每一个团员献上了一束束鲜花，一个个花环，这时，全场一片欢腾。
    全国劳音事务局长牧野在致欢迎词中强调说，美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人。我们坚决为反对美帝国主义侵略越南、反对佐藤政府充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的帮凶，为建设一个民族独立、人民民主、人民大众的日本而努力。
    他说，中国的革命的歌舞，一定会鼓舞日本人民的斗争。他最后祝愿日中两国人民的战斗友谊不断加强。
    北京歌舞团团长王前在讲话中强调说，“北京歌舞团通过这次访日，将向日本人民介绍我国社会主义文艺在毛泽东思想哺育下所取得的光辉成就，介绍中国人民过去和今天的斗争和生活，以加强和发展两国人民间的文化交流和战斗友谊。”
    王前强调指出，“美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者，虽然千方百计地破坏我们的友好事业，但中日友好运动，不但没有因之而削弱、缩小，相反地更加加强和扩大了。”
    他指出，“中日友好是一股不可阻挡的历史洪流，是任何力量也破坏不了的。”他最后说，“在中日两国人民的共同努力下，两国人民的战斗友谊将会继续不断地取得新的发展。”
