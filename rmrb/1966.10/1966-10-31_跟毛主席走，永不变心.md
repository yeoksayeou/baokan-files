Upon hearing the news of our country's successful launch of a missile carrying a nuclear warhead, my heart swelled with immense joy. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a momentous event for the 700 million people of our nation. For the heroic people of Vietnam, who are engaged in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and for all revolutionary people around the world who are fighting bravely, this is the greatest encouragement and support. For imperialism and all reactionaries, it is a devastating blow.

Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people. We poor and lower-middle peasants understand best the profound kindness of our Party and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is great, Mao Zedong Thought is great, our country is great. Today's Chinese people are truly happy. In all of history, no dynasty can compare to the Mao Zedong era. People like me, who were once trampled in the mud for generations, have completely turned our fortunes around in the era led by Chairman Mao. Moreover, I have become a representative of the National People's Congress and have had the honor of seeing our beloved leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, twice.

Due to Chairman Mao's teachings, I have come to deeply understand that the enemy always harbors hatred for us. They will stop at nothing to sabotage our efforts, preventing us from following Chairman Mao on the socialist path. The enemy will struggle desperately to the end, so we must always be vigilant and never forget class struggle. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, together with the workers and the People's Liberation Army, must firmly grasp the reins of power of the proletariat and forever safeguard the socialist state. I often write to my son Ouyang He in the army, instructing him to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Recently, my wife and I have been discussing whether our son Ouyang Zengbang, who is eligible to enlist this year, should join the army if the Party needs him. We will definitely encourage him, just like his two elder brothers, to take up arms and bravely defend our socialist homeland. Our family has only one path and one resolve: to resolutely follow the Party, follow Chairman Mao, and never waver!

    跟毛主席走，永不变心
    全国人民代表大会代表  共产主义战士欧阳海的父亲欧  阳恒文
    听了我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息，我心中万分高兴。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是我国七亿人民的大喜事。这对于正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民，对于全世界正在进行英勇斗争的革命人民，是一个最大的鼓舞和支持；对于帝国主义和一切反动派，是一个最沉重的打击。
    毛主席是我们革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳，我们贫下中农最懂得我们的党和毛主席的恩情。毛主席就是伟大，毛泽东思想就是伟大，我们的国家就是伟大。今天的中国人民就是幸福。自古以来，没有那一个朝代能与毛泽东时代相比。像我这样过去祖祖辈辈被踩在泥沟里的穷光蛋，在毛主席领导的时代，彻底翻了身，而且成为全国人民代表大会代表，两次见到过我们心中的红太阳、最敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    由于毛主席的教导，也使我深深懂得，敌人总是仇视我们的。他们总是千方百计进行破坏，不让我们跟毛主席走社会主义道路。敌人还要垂死挣扎，我们一定要时刻提高警惕，千万千万不要忘记阶级斗争。我们广大贫下中农和广大工人、解放军一道，一定要掌握好无产阶级的印把子，永保社会主义江山。我经常写信给在部队的儿子欧阳湖，嘱咐他：在部队一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    这一向，我也同老伴儿在商量，满崽增榜今年参军已够格了，如果党需要，我俩一定叫他像他两个哥哥一样，拿起枪杆子，去勇敢地捍卫我们的社会主义的江山。我们全家的道路只有一条，决心只有一个：就是坚决跟党走，跟毛主席走，永不变心！
