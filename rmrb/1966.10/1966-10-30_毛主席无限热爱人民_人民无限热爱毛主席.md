The three films documenting Chairman Mao's three receptions of the Red Guards and revolutionary students are being screened in rural areas across the country. Millions of revolutionary masses are overjoyed and enthusiastic, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echo everywhere in the cinema and screening venues.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, the three large-scale color documentary films of our great leader Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary students have been screened in rural areas, remote regions, and minority areas across the country. Millions of revolutionary masses have seen their most beloved leader Chairman Mao on the screen, regarding it as the greatest happiness of their lives. They say, Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Chairman Mao receiving revolutionary masses in Beijing is the same as receiving us. Chairman Mao's heart is always with us. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

In vast areas of our country, whether in plains, villages, counties, or towns, when the news of screening the films of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary students spread, the masses were overjoyed and spread the word to each other. At each screening location, a festive revolutionary scene unfolded. Revolutionary masses held up red flags, carried portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, held copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang revolutionary songs, beat drums and gongs, and marched towards the screening venue.

In Chairman Mao's hometown, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan Commune, revolutionary cadres and masses from various departments in the Shaoshan area, and Red Guards from all over the country visiting Shaoshan gathered in the playground of Shaoshan School to watch the color documentary film of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary students. When our most beloved leader Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the entire venue erupted in excitement, and everyone repeatedly held up copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waving their arms and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!" The poor and lower-middle peasants from Zao Yuan, Yang Jia Ling, and Wang Jia Ping, where Chairman Mao stayed in Yan'an, recently saw Chairman Mao on the screen. Chen Youma, an old member of the Red Guards from Zao Yuan, had represented the revolutionary masses of Zao Yuan to see Chairman Mao in Beijing in 1957, and Chairman Mao shook hands with him. This time, when he saw Chairman Mao on the screen, he instinctively reached out his hand, as if shaking hands with Chairman Mao again. Old peasant Gao Tongyou from Zao Yuan said, "Tonight, Chairman Mao is back in our Zao Yuan, talking to us as if he were here, giving us strength." His daughter-in-law, Deputy Platoon Leader of the militia, Dou Fengying, said, "Chairman Mao loves the people, and the people love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's heart is always connected with ours."

The poor and lower-middle peasants in the revolutionary old base areas yearn for Chairman Mao day and night. They welcomed the screening of these three films with the eagerness to see Chairman Mao again. When the films arrived at the revolutionary old base area of Ningxia Pastoral Region, Yancai County, Fanxiu Commune, Dongfeng Brigade, it was already one o'clock in the morning. Many community members had been waiting here. Some had even traveled from dozens of miles away. When Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, radiant and spirited, appeared on the screen among the millions of cultural revolutionaries, the screening venue immediately boiled over. The cheers on the screen and the cheers at the screening venue merged into one. Every time Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the screening venue erupted in enthusiastic cheers and applause. After one screening, it still could not satisfy the community members' desire to see Chairman Mao, so they watched three screenings in a row. In the revolutionary old base area of Longyan County, Fujian Province, West Bank Commune, 82-year-old old peasant community member Guo Jinlong had seen Chairman Mao and heard Chairman Mao's speech in Longyan in 1929. This time, he leaned on a cane to the screening venue and watched two screenings. He said emotionally, "Chairman Mao is always with us, the revolutionary masses of the old base areas. Chairman Mao is in such good health, which is the greatest happiness for the people of the whole country and the world." After watching the film, Lao Hongmi, an old Red Army soldier from Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province, Yixiu People's Commune, expressed his determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works actively, to be like the 32111 Hero Drilling Team, to imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, unchanging even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble.

Many revolutionary masses in remote and minority areas watched Chairman Mao in the film with immense excitement and joy, receiving great encouragement. Twenty-one brotherly ethnic minorities in Yunnan border areas saw Chairman Mao in the film. A 91-year-old old woman, Tang Congshan, from the city of Mengzi, was supported by her 61-year-old daughter to watch the film. Tang Congshan said, "I want to see with my own eyes our great savior, Chairman Mao." Many poor and lower-middle peasant community members in Baonan County, Guangdong Province, near the border, said after watching the film: Chairman Mao shaking hands with the Red Guards warms our hearts, as if Chairman Mao had shaken hands with us! The liberated herdsmen in the vast northern Tibetan region of Naqu, with the deepest affection for Chairman Mao, dressed in new clothes for festivals, held up portraits of Chairman Mao, rode tall horses, and joyfully went to the outdoor screening venue to watch the film. The vast herdsmen jointly expressed: Although we are on the plateau, our hearts are always towards Beijing. We must read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and respond to Chairman Mao's greatest concern for us.

Revolutionary masses in various places were greatly inspired after watching the film and unanimously expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works actively, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, seizing the revolution, promoting production, and achieving double victories in revolution and production. Five Korean ethnic poor peasant women in Yanji City, Jilin Province, organized a study group immediately after watching the film, studying Chairman Mao's quotations every day. In the Yanghe Bank area of Xixiang County, Shannan (now belonging to Yanghe Commune), where Chairman Mao had made comments in the book "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," 20,000 community members watched the film. The broad poor and lower-middle peasant community members expressed: We must resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, and turn the entire commune into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Red Guards and revolutionary students in various places were even more overjoyed after watching the film. They expressed: Chairman Mao trusts us the most and supports us the most. We must forever follow Chairman Mao, learn to fight in the struggle, learn to revolutionize in the revolution, and temper ourselves into good students and good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Filmmakers in various places regarded the screening of the films of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary students as the most significant and glorious political task of learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, regarding participating in this screening work as their greatest happiness. They all completed this task with the most enthusiastic revolutionary spirit.
