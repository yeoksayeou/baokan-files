The Chinese Embassy has lodged a serious protest with the Indonesian authorities over their attempt to illegally close the Chinese Consulate in Medan. The Chinese government will not allow the Indonesian government to strip the consulate of its privileges.

	New China News Agency, October 25th: Jakarta — On the 22nd, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, protesting strongly against the right-wing military authorities' unreasonable announcement of "taking over" the Chinese Consulate in Medan. The note pointed out that this is a serious incident of blatantly trampling on international norms and deliberately worsening relations between China and Indonesia.

	The note said: On the morning of October 12, 1966, several military officers from the 0212 Military District of Medan forcibly entered the temporarily closed Chinese Consulate in Medan. They openly announced to the consulate's custodians that they were going to "take over" the Chinese Consulate and threatened the custodians to hand over the keys to the consulate. Three of the officers, ignoring the consulate's custodians' objections, rushed into the consulate's rooms and conducted a "property inventory." Before leaving, these officers even ordered the Chinese consulate's custodians to move out within a week. This is a serious incident of blatantly trampling on international norms and deliberately worsening relations between the two countries. The Chinese Embassy strongly protests to the Indonesian government over this.

	The note said: The military authorities in Medan have long been attempting to "take over" the Chinese Consulate in Medan. After the Chinese Consulate was forced to suspend operations in March, the military authorities in Medan increased the number of police officers stationed at the consulate and brazenly hoisted the Indonesian national flag. The Chinese Embassy had previously lodged a serious protest with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding that the Indonesian government withdraw the police from the Chinese Consulate and stop hoisting the Indonesian national flag. It is outrageous that the Indonesian government has not taken any measures to correct this blatant act. What's more, in late September, when Vice Consul Kwok Suk-ming of the Chinese Consulate in Medan returned to the consulate to handle the repatriation of affected overseas Chinese, the military authorities in Medan imposed various restrictions and obstacles on Vice Consul Kwok Suk-ming's normal consular duties, even unreasonably preventing the Chinese Vice Consul from hoisting the Chinese national flag at the consulate. On September 29, the Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region, Leo Roblisha, met with Vice Consul Kwok Suk-ming and openly denied the existence of the Chinese Consulate in Medan and the consular status of Vice Consul Kwok Suk-ming. Now, the military authorities in Medan are attempting to "take over" the Chinese Consulate, obviously aiming to use illegal means to close the Chinese Consulate. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese government.

	The note said: It must be pointed out that the Chinese Consulate in Medan was forced to suspend operations after being attacked and destroyed multiple times by right-wing thugs in Indonesia, with the safety of consulate personnel seriously threatened and their normal duties unreasonably restricted. The Chinese government will not allow the Indonesian authorities to unilaterally deny the existence of the Chinese Consulate in Medan and arbitrarily strip and infringe upon the privileges of the Chinese consulate. The Chinese Embassy reiterates that the Indonesian government must apologize for the above serious incidents and take effective measures to protect the safety of the Chinese Consulate in Medan and its custodians, and ensure that the consular privileges enjoyed by Chinese consular officials are not infringed upon.

    我大使馆照会严重抗议印尼当局企图非法封闭我驻棉兰领事馆
    中国政府绝不许印尼政府剥夺我领事特权
    新华社二十五日讯  雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十二日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就右派军事当局无理宣布“接管”中国驻棉兰领事馆，向印度尼西亚政府提出严重抗议，并且指出，这是粗暴践踏国际关系准则，蓄意进一步恶化中国和印尼两国关系的严重事件。
    照会说：一九六六年十月十二日上午，印度尼西亚棉兰○二一二军支区派出军官多名，强行进入暂时停止办公的中国驻棉兰领事馆，公然向中国领事馆看守人员宣布要“接管”中国领事馆，威胁看守人员交出领事馆的钥匙。其中三名军官，不顾领事馆看守人员的反对，冲进领事馆室内，进行了“财物登记”。这批军官临走时还竟然限令中国领事馆看守人员在一周内迁出。这是粗暴践踏国际关系准则，蓄意进一步恶化两国关系的严重事件。对此，中国大使馆向印度尼西亚政府提出严重抗议。
    照会说：棉兰军事当局企图“接管”中国驻棉兰领事馆由来已久。中国领事馆在今年三月间被迫暂停办公后，棉兰军事当局就增派一名警官强行进驻领事馆，并悍然在领事馆升起印度尼西亚国旗。对此，中国大使馆曾经向印度尼西亚外交部提出严正交涉，要求印度尼西亚政府撤走住在中国领事馆内的警察，停止在中国领事馆升印度尼西亚国旗。令人愤慨的是，印度尼西亚政府一直没有采取任何措施来纠正这种粗暴的做法。不仅如此，今年九月下旬，中国驻棉兰领事馆副领事邝叔明返回领事馆办理接运受害华侨回国事宜期间，棉兰陆军当局竟对邝叔明副领事履行正常领事职务进行了种种限制和刁难，甚至无理阻挠中国副领事在领事馆升挂中国国旗。九月二十九日第二军区参谋长利奥·罗布利沙接见邝叔明副领事，公然否认中国驻棉兰领事馆的存在，否认邝叔明副领事的领事地位。现在棉兰军事当局又出面要“接管”中国领事馆，显然是印度尼西亚政府企图用非法霸占的手法以达到封闭中国领事馆的目的。这是中国政府绝对不能同意的。
    照会说：必须指出，中国驻棉兰领事馆是在遭到印度尼西亚右派暴徒多次袭击和破坏，领事馆人员的安全受到严重威胁，执行正常职务受到无理限制的情况下，才被迫暂停办公。中国政府绝不容许印度尼西亚当局片面否认中国驻棉兰领事馆的存在，任意剥夺和侵犯中国领事的特权。中国大使馆重申，印度尼西亚政府必须就上述严重事件道歉，并采取切实有效的措施保护中国驻棉兰领事馆和领事馆看守人员的安全，保障中国领事官员应享有的领事特权不受侵犯。
