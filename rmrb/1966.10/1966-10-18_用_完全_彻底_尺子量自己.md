In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards have achieved tremendous feats! The People's Liberation Army has such heroic successors, and I feel immensely proud.

Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party and the Communist Party-led Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are revolutionary forces. Our forces are completely dedicated to liberating the people and thoroughly serve the interests of the people."

In recent years, I have deeply felt that to revolutionize, to transform one's thoughts, and to do a good job, one must always rely on Mao Zedong Thought and the high standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as taught by Chairman Mao. Using the "complete" and "thorough" rulers to measure thoughts and work can help you quickly identify problems and solve them effectively. Wherever you apply it, it works.

Let me share a small incident: When I first became the stock manager, one night I heard that the warehouse storing peanuts had two rat holes, and I wanted to block them. However, I couldn't move the sacks by myself. Should I ask for help? I was afraid others would say: You are truly a new official setting three fires, burning during the day and night. With such thoughts, my actions became hesitant. But thinking of Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, I decided to start moving the sacks immediately. Comrades heard about it and came to help, and soon the holes were blocked.

Chairman Mao said: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must serve the interests of the people. If there are errors, they must be corrected, and this is called being responsible to the people." From this, I understand that no matter what we do, as long as it is responsible to the revolution and beneficial to the revolution, nothing else should be considered. Fear of this and that is all individualism and selfish thoughts. Every time you do a job and fight a battle of thought, your consciousness will be raised, and the roots of Mao Zedong Thought will be deeper. The more thorough the struggle, the deeper the roots of Mao Zedong Thought will be.

Dear Red Guards, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the "Sixteen Points" as our weapon, bravely charge into battle, and achieve the most complete and thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Let Mao Zedong Thought shine forever, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high all over the world!

### 用“完全”“彻底”尺子量自己

    用“完全”“彻底”尺子量自己
    济南部队某部军需股长　孙乐义
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵小将们立下了巨大功勋！解放军有这样英雄的后备军，我感到无比自豪。
    毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    这些年，我深深体会到：要革命，要改造自己的思想，要做好工作，一刻也离不开毛泽东思想，离不开毛主席教导的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的高标准。用“完全”“彻底”这两把尺子来量思想，量工作，它能使你发现问题快，解决问题好，用到哪里，哪里灵。
    我不妨谈一件小事：在我刚当股长的时候，有一天晚上，我听说放花生米的仓库里，有两个老鼠洞，想去堵一堵。可是，我一个人搬不动麻袋，怎么办？找别人吧，又怕别人说：你真是新官上任三把火，白天烧，晚上也烧。思想上有了顾虑，行动上就犹豫了。可是，想到毛主席教导的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，又决心立即动手去搬，同志们听说后也都来了，很快就把洞堵好了。
    毛主席说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”从这里我体会到，不管干什么事情，只要是对革命负责，对革命有利，别的什么也不应该去考虑。怕这怕那的，都是个人主义，都是私心杂念。干一件工作，斗一次思想，觉悟就会提高一步，毛泽东思想的根子就会扎深一分。斗争越彻底，毛泽东思想的根子就扎得越深。
    亲爱的红卫兵小将们，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以十六条为武器，勇敢地冲锋陷阵，最完全最彻底地取得无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，让毛泽东思想世世代代永放光芒，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在全世界高高飘扬！
