Today in the afternoon, part of the workers, peasants, and soldiers representatives and heroic models who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration met with 80,000 Red Guards from the capital at the Workers' Stadium. They praised the Red Guards' daring spirit of revolution, daring to rebel, daring to fight, and daring to make revolution in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to be the strong backing of the Red Guards and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They enthusiastically encouraged the Red Guards to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points" in their struggles, to become steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers representatives and heroic models attending today's meeting included: Wang Youfa, Lei Hongbing, and Li Zhiguo from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, Jia Jincai, the chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association of Dazhai Brigade, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, Li Chengming, a peasant from Qiping County, Shandong Province, and the vice-secretary of the county committee who is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, San Shengcun, the squad leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Wang Yuchang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao and a model of loving soldiers, Feng Yuping, a good daughter of the Party, Liu Guangyou, the foster mother of Zhang Side, Luo Diekai, the father of the internationalist soldier Luo Shengjiao, Ouyang Hengwen, the father of the communist warrior Ouyang Hai, Wang Jue's father Wang Rutan, and Liu Yingjun's mother Zhu Xiulan, totaling more than 40 people.

At around 2 PM, when the meeting was about to begin, the workers, peasants, and soldiers representatives and heroic models first circled the field to greet the Red Guards. The entire venue immediately erupted in thunderous applause and cheers: "Learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers!" "Salute to the workers, peasants, and soldiers!" "Learn from the heroes and models!" "Salute to the heroes and models!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" The Red Guards enthusiastically stood up, holding high the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waving them continuously, turning the entire venue into a sea of red.

Jia Jincai, the chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association of Dazhai Brigade and an old hero, was the first to speak at the meeting. He praised the millions of Red Guards as Chairman Mao's good students. He said, "I love the Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought the most." His brief and powerful speech was met with enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

Li Chengming, a peasant and vice-secretary of the Shandong Provincial Qiping County Committee, originally from the Double Temple Commune, Double Temple Brigade, vividly introduced at the meeting how the Double Temple Brigade, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has been learning from Daqing, Dazhai, and the People's Liberation Army since 1963. They have firmly grasped the class struggle as the key link, carried out the three great revolutionary movements, overcome the three major disasters of drought, flood, and alkali, and turned the brigade from low yield to high yield. He said, "These achievements are the victories of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever is done according to Mao Zedong Thought will be smooth and successful. Mao Zedong Thought is effective in all aspects, subduing the heavens and increasing the yield of the earth. Fighting capitalism will greatly promote socialism, and fighting the bourgeoisie and revisionism will sweep away the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and revisionism." When talking about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he said passionately, "We poor and lower-middle peasants will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to criticize the bourgeoisie and turn Qiping County and Double Temple Brigade into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Let us join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and march forward bravely along the path indicated by Chairman Mao!" His report was met with sustained applause from the Red Guards.

San Shengcun, the squad leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, and Wang Yuchang, a model of loving soldiers, both expressed in their speeches their support for the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, encouraging them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, to focus on the "use" aspect, to grasp the correct direction of the struggle, to unite the majority, to overthrow, smash, and expose the capitalist roaders in power within the Party, to sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Zhu Xiulan, the mother of Liu Yingjun, praised at the meeting, "The Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought, breaking the four olds of the bourgeoisie and establishing the four news of the proletariat, are great and good deeds! We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards!"

The heroic words and passionate speeches of the workers, peasants, and soldiers representatives and heroic models greatly inspired the Red Guards. Many Red Guards expressed that they would definitely make reading Chairman Mao's books their first need in life, like the heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team, taking Mao Zedong Thought as their soul, imprinting it in their minds, dissolving it in their blood, and implementing it in their actions. They said, the workers, peasants, and soldiers have the most steadfast stance, the clearest hatred and love, and the deepest love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They are the main force of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We should pay tribute to the heroes of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and learn from them. We should rise up with a thousand-catty hammer, thoroughly rebel against the bourgeoisie, revisionism, imperialism, and all reactionaries, let Mao Zedong Thought shine over the globe, and create a bright red new world.

    革命小将们表示：一定要向工农兵学习，把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要
    新华社八日讯　今天下午，来北京参加国庆观礼的部分工农兵代表和英雄模范人物在工人体育场同首都八万红卫兵亲切会见。他们赞扬红卫兵在无产阶级文化大革命中敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，表示要做红卫兵的坚强后盾，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们热情地鼓励红卫兵在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作和十六条，做坚定的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    出席今天大会的工农兵代表和英雄模范人物有：32111英雄钻井队的王有发、雷洪炳、李治国，山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队贫协主任贾进才，山东省学习毛主席著作积极分子、茌平县农民出身的县委副书记李成明，中国人民解放军某部指导员、学习毛主席著作积极分子桑圣存，毛主席的好战士、爱兵模范王裕昌，党的好女儿冯玉萍，以及张思德的养母刘光友、国际主义战士罗盛教的父亲罗迭开、共产主义战士欧阳海的父亲欧阳恒文、毛主席的好战士王杰的父亲王儒堂、刘英俊的妈妈朱秀兰等共四十多人。
    二时许，当大会快开始的时候，工农兵代表和英雄模范们首先绕场一周和红卫兵见面，全场顿时响起了雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声：“向工农兵学习！”“向工农兵致敬！”“向英雄模范学习！”“向英雄模范致敬！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”红卫兵小将们纷纷起立，高高举起红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不停地挥舞，使整个会场变成了红色的海洋。
    大寨大队的贫协主任、老英雄贾进才第一个在大会上讲话。他称赞千千万万个红卫兵是毛主席的好学生。他说：“我最爱用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵。”他简短有力的发言，博得全场热烈的掌声。
    农民出身的中共山东省茌平县委副书记李成明，原来是，现在仍然兼任这个县双庙公社双庙大队的党支部书记。他在会上生动地介绍了双庙大队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自一九六三年到现在，学习大庆、大寨，学习解放军，紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，进行三大革命运动，战胜旱、涝、碱三大灾害，使这个队由低产变高产的事迹。他说：“这些成就，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。凡是按照毛泽东思想办事的，一顺百顺万事顺，一胜百胜万事胜。毛泽东思想百用百灵，斗天天低头，斗地地增产。斗资本主义，社会主义就大大发扬，斗资产阶级、修正主义，资产阶级、修正主义就威风扫地。”在谈到无产阶级文化大革命时，他热情奔放地说：“我们贫下中农要坚决按照毛主席的指示，也要批判资产阶级，把茌平县、双庙大队办成毛泽东思想的大学校。”“让我们手拉手，肩并肩，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席所指引的方向，奋勇前进！”他的报告，获得了全场红卫兵经久不息的掌声。
    解放军某部指导员、学习毛主席著作积极分子桑圣存、爱兵模范王裕昌，都在发言中表示支持红卫兵的革命行动，鼓励他们活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，掌握好斗争的大方向，团结大多数，把党内走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    刘英俊的母亲朱秀兰在会上称赞说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵，大破资产阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，这是大快人心的好事，好得很！我们贫下中农坚决支持红卫兵的革命行动！”
    工农兵代表和英雄模范们的豪言壮语和热情洋溢的讲话，极大地鼓舞了红卫兵小将。许多红卫兵纷纷表示，一定要把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，像32111钻井队的英雄们那样，把毛泽东思想作为自己的灵魂，印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上。他们说，工农兵立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，对毛主席、毛泽东思想最热爱，他们是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的主力军。我们要向工农兵英雄们致敬，向他们学习。我们要奋起千钧棒，彻底造资产阶级、修正主义、帝国主义和一切反动派的反，让毛泽东思想普照全球，创造一个红通通的新世界。
