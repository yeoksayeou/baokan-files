According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on October 29, Tokyo: The majority of the leadership of the Japan-China Friendship Association, in order to firmly oppose U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism and their various followers, and to further develop the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, announced on October 25 that they resolutely sever ties with a small clique within the association that sabotages Sino-Japanese friendship. They also expressed their determination to continue fighting to defend the glorious tradition of the Japan-China Friendship Association.

On October 25, the Japan-China Friendship Association held a standing committee meeting to discuss the joint statement signed by the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation and the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation in Beijing on October 12. At the meeting, a small clique of people who, under the guise of "friendship," actually oppose Sino-Japanese friendship, put forward various excuses in an attempt to obstruct the meeting from adopting this joint statement. Thus, the majority of the leadership, who insist on Sino-Japanese friendship, engaged in a fierce struggle with them. During the vote, the majority of those present expressed their support for the joint statement, thereby foiling the plot of that small clique. However, that small clique, in a fit of rage, rushed to the chairman's seat after the vote, demanding the cancellation of the vote. In this situation, the leaders of the Japan-China Friendship Association, including Kurosawa Toshio, Ito Takeo, Mishima Hitoshi, Miyazaki Seikin, Ohmori Shinichiro, Iwamura Sanzen, Miyoshi Kazuo, Makino Takeshi, Saito Norie, Akatsuki Yoshizo, Otaka Ariaki, Koya Shoichiro, Okada Haruo, Hozumi Shichiro, Shimada Masao, Osagawa Shunsho, Sakata Teruaki, and Amae Reizo, immediately declared that they resolutely sever ties with that small clique that sabotages Sino-Japanese friendship. Together with four others, a total of 29 people, they left the meeting. The president of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Matsumoto Jiichiro, expressed his support for the just actions of these 29 people.

That evening, Miyazaki Seikin, the chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, held a press conference, representing those who left the meeting, announcing that they would sever ties with the small clique within the Japan-China Friendship Association that sabotages Sino-Japanese friendship and fight for the development of genuine Sino-Japanese friendship.

The leaders of the Japan-China Friendship Association who insist on the correct stance issued a statement to the members of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the broad masses of the Japanese people on October 26.

The statement pointed out: "Some people supported by a certain political party obstructed the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival and obstructed the development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement in every way," "Maliciously, they hang the sign of 'Sino-Japanese friendship' while secretly engaging in anti-China propaganda."

The statement said that these people refused to acknowledge the joint statement signed by the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation and the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation in Beijing on October 12.

The statement expressed the determination to sever ties with this small clique that sabotages Sino-Japanese friendship.

The statement called on the broad members of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Japanese people to unite around the "Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters," "based on the demands of the broad masses of various strata for Sino-Japanese friendship, and with the joint statement of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation and the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation as the pillar, to vigorously develop the friendship movement."

The statement was signed by Matsumoto Jiichiro, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters, Vice Chairman Ito Takeo, Mishima Hitoshi, Kurosawa Toshio, Yoshida Hosei, Chairman Miyazaki Seikin, Vice Chairman Ohmori Shinichiro, Iwamura Sanzen, and Secretary-General Miyoshi Kazuo.

On the same day, these leaders of the Japan-China Friendship Association who insist on the correct stance, along with about 90 supporting members of the Japan-China Friendship Association, held a meeting in Tokyo, expressing their determination to resolutely expel those who sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship and strive to promote the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. The meeting unanimously agreed with the correct stance taken by Kurosawa Toshio, Miyazaki Seikin, and others at the standing committee meeting of the Japan-China Friendship Association on October 25, and the statement issued by the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters. The attendees decided that, as long as the elements sabotaging Sino-Japanese friendship have not been eliminated, they would call their own headquarters the "Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters."

The leaders of the Japan-China Friendship Association who insist on the correct stance made statements one after another on the evening of October 25, explaining the significance of this split between the majority of the leaders of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and the small clique of saboteurs.

    谁破坏日中友好谁就遭到唾弃
    日中友协多数领导人同一小撮反华分子决裂
    据新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会的多数领导人为坚持反对美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者，为进一步发展日中两国人民的战斗友谊，二十五日宣布坚决同这个协会的一小撮破坏日中友好的分子断绝关系，并且表示今后为继续保卫日中友好协会的光荣传统而斗争。
    日中友好协会二十五日举行常任理事会，讨论日中友好协会代表团同中日友好协会代表团十月十二日在北京签署的共同声明。会上，一小撮打着“友好”招牌反对日中友好的别有用心的分子，提出种种借口，妄图阻挠会议通过这一共同声明，于是坚持日中友好的多数领导人，同他们展开了激烈的斗争。在表决时，出席会议的多数人表示赞成共同声明，这样就挫败了那一小撮人的阴谋。但是，那一小撮人竟然恼羞成怒，在表决以后，蛮不讲理地拥上主席席位，要求取消表决。在这种情况下，日中友好协会的领导人黑田寿男、伊藤武雄、三岛一、宫崎世民、大森真一郎、岩村三千夫、三好一、牧野内武人、斋藤纪江、赤津益造、大塚有章、古谷庄一郎、冈田春夫、穗积七郎、岛田政雄、押川俊夫、坂田辉昭、雨宫礼三等二十五人，当即声明坚决同那一小撮破坏日中友好的分子断绝关系，并同其他四人共二十九人一道退出了会场。日中友好协会会长松本治一郎表明他支持这二十九人的正义行动。
    当晚，日中友好协会理事长宫崎世民举行记者招待会，代表退出会场的人宣布，今后要同日中友好协会内部的一小撮破坏日中友好的分子断绝关系，为发展真正的日中友好运动而斗争。
    坚持正确立场的日中友好运动的领导人，二十六日发表了致日中友好协会会员和日本广大同胞的声明。
    声明指出：“一些得到特定政党支持的人阻挠了日中青年友好大联欢，并且在每一件事情上都阻挠日中友好运动的发展”，“阴险卑鄙的是，他们表面上挂着‘日中友好’的招牌，背地里专心致力于反华宣传”。
    声明说，这些人拒绝承认日中友好协会代表团和中日友好协会代表团十月十二日在北京签署的共同声明。
    声明表示要同这一小撮破坏日中友好的分子断绝关系。
    声明号召广大的日中友好协会会员和日本人民，团结在“日中友好协会（正统）总部”周围，“以广大的各阶层同胞对于日中友好的要求为基础，以日中友好协会代表团和中日友好协会代表团的共同声明为支柱，大力地发展友好运动。”
    在这个声明上签字的有日中友好协会（正统）总部会长松本治一郎、副会长伊藤武雄、三岛一、黑田寿男、吉田法晴，理事长宫崎世民，副理事长大森真一郎、岩村三千夫，事务局长三好一。
    同一天，这些坚持正确立场的日中友好运动的领导人和大约九十名支持他们的日中友好协会理事在东京举行会议，表示要坚决摈弃破坏日中友好的分子，努力推进日中友好运动。会议一致同意了黑田寿男、宫崎世民等人二十五日在日中友好协会常任理事会会议上采取的正确态度和日中友协（正统）总部发表的声明。与会者决定，在破坏日中友好的分子没有消亡以前，要把他们自己的总部称为“日中友好协会（正统）总部”。
    坚持正确立场的日中友好协会领导人曾于二十五日晚间纷纷发表谈话，阐明这一次日中友好运动的多数领导干部同一小撮破坏分子决裂的重要意义。
