According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 4th: According to the Guanghua ship, the Guanghua ship, commissioned by the Chinese government and people to go to Indonesia to bring back persecuted overseas Chinese, departed from the port of Belawan in Medan, Indonesia, on the afternoon of the 3rd, carrying 1,005 persecuted overseas Chinese back to the motherland.

The Guanghua ship entered the port of Belawan on September 26. Due to the new obstacles set up by the Indonesian government in this repatriation work, the Guanghua ship was forced to stay in the port for eight days.

At noon on the 3rd, the persecuted overseas Chinese began to board the motherland's repatriation ship. The Guanghua ship flew the Five-Star Red Flag and dozens of colorful banners, with the solemn melody of "The East Is Red" playing over the loudspeakers. The crew, dressed in white sailor uniforms, stood neatly on the deck, welcoming their compatriots who had suffered persecution in Indonesia. On the dock, the military authorities of Medan, Indonesia, had been on high alert since dawn, as if facing a major enemy.

The persecuted overseas Chinese were warmly received by the crew of the Guanghua ship. Many crew members helped the elderly and children on the dock and at the gangway, and used stretchers to carry the severely ill and disabled compatriots, who had been tortured by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, onto the ship. Many of the persecuted compatriots were moved to tears by the great care of the motherland. As soon as they boarded the ship, they held the crew's hands and said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for sending you to bring us back. Long live Chairman Mao!" They also gathered on the deck, facing the dock, and raised their arms to shout slogans such as "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and sang songs like "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" in unison. The voices of the persecuted compatriots and the applause of the crew blended together.

These overseas Chinese were driven from the Aceh region of Sumatra Island to Medan by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia. As soon as they boarded the Guanghua ship, they angrily denounced to their compatriots in the motherland the fascist crimes of the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia who had brutally persecuted the overseas Chinese. Many of them were evicted from their homes, and their property was looted by right-wing thugs. The 1,005 overseas Chinese who boarded the ship had only 853 pieces of luggage in total. The vast majority had been beaten by right-wing thugs, or subjected to savage treatment such as being doused with paint, exposed to the sun, and forced to drink dirty water. Some of their relatives were also brutally killed by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia.

The persecuted overseas Chinese pointed out that the brutal persecution of overseas Chinese by the Indonesian authorities is undeniable and must be severely condemned by the just public opinion of the world. They said, "We have Chairman Mao and 700 million people of the motherland as our backing, we are not afraid of anything!"

    毛主席领导的伟大祖国是华侨的强大后盾
    光华轮接运千余难侨从印尼启航归国
    难侨们热烈感谢祖国的巨大关怀，愤怒控诉印尼反动势力的反华罪行
    据新华社四日讯　据光华轮消息：接受祖国政府和人民的委托前往印度尼西亚接运受害华侨回国的光华轮，已在三日下午载着一千零五名受害华侨，从印度尼西亚棉兰的勿拉湾港启航回国。
    光华轮是在九月二十六日进入勿拉湾港的。由于印度尼西亚政府在这次接侨工作中设置了新的重重障碍，光华轮不得不在港内滞留了八天之久。
    三日中午，受害华侨陆续登上祖国的接侨船。光华轮上飘扬着五星红旗和几十面彩旗，扩音器里播送着庄严的《东方红》乐曲。船员们穿着白色的海员服，整齐地排列在甲板上，迎接在印度尼西亚受尽迫害的侨胞上船。在码头上，印度尼西亚棉兰军事当局的武装部队从清晨起就戒备森严，如临大敌。
    受害华侨们受到了光华轮船员们的热情接待。许多船员在码头上和舷梯边扶老携幼，并用担架把因受印度尼西亚右派反动势力的折磨而患重病和造成残废的侨胞抬到船上。许多受害侨胞对于祖国的巨大关怀感动得热泪盈眶，他们一上船就拉着船员们的手说：“感谢毛主席和祖国人民派你们来接我们，毛主席万岁！”他们还齐集在甲板上，面向码头举臂高呼“中华人民共和国万岁”“中国共产党万岁”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”等口号，并不断高唱《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲。受害侨胞的歌声和船员们的掌声响成一片。
    这些华侨都是从苏门答腊岛上的亚齐地区被印度尼西亚右派反动势力逼赶到棉兰的。他们一登上光华轮，就向祖国亲人愤怒控诉印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂残害华侨的法西斯罪行，他们中间有许多人被扫地出门，财产被右派暴徒抢劫一空，上船的一千零五名华侨，一共只有八百五十三件行李。绝大多数人都受到右派暴徒的毒打，或者受到用油漆浇身、在烈日下曝晒以及逼灌污水等等野蛮残害。有些人的亲人还惨遭印度尼西亚右派反动势力杀害。
    受害华侨们指出，印度尼西亚当局残酷迫害华侨的暴行是抵赖不了的，他们一定要受到全世界公正舆论的严厉谴责。他们说：“我们有毛主席和七亿祖国人民做后盾，什么也不怕！”
