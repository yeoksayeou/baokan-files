	Old Thoughts Will Not Fall Without a Fight
	Five Good Soldier Wu Jun

	From my studies, I have come to realize that to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must first dare to "put oneself in it," to dare to expose the bourgeois dirty thoughts in one's mind. Whether one dares to "expose" or not is a question of daring to carry out self-revolution. It is also a breakthrough point for using Mao Zedong Thought to transform oneself. If one cannot open this breach, one cannot fight a deep battle, let alone completely defeat the "enemy."

	Last year, I went to a certain place on a mission and accidentally injured my right hand. The leadership advised me to rest, but I thought about how, since joining the army, I had often been praised, so I gritted my teeth and continued to work. In this way, I worked for more than ten days, but not only did I not receive any praise, my name was not even mentioned. I was very unhappy about this. But I immediately realized: seeking praise in work is the result of personalistic selfish thoughts, exactly what Chairman Mao criticized: "Having done a little work, one feels great, likes to boast, and is afraid that others do not know." I wanted to expose this stinking thought several times, but then I thought, I am a model soldier in studying Chairman Mao's works in the company, and just a few days ago, I shared my experiences. If I expose it, will my comrades laugh at me? The result of the struggle was still to secretly change it. Who would have thought that personalism is like mold, the more it is not exposed to the sun, the more it proliferates. Although I used great willpower to suppress the thought of seeking praise, the personalistic calculations in my head still clicked away. What was the reason? I brought this question to Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary things, if you do not hit them, they will not fall." Chairman Mao's teachings immediately removed the tight ring from my head. I realized that erroneous thoughts are also not defeated without a fight, so I summoned the courage to expose all my dirty thoughts at the class meeting. My comrades not only did not laugh at me, but actively and enthusiastically helped me. I also studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles, using Mao Zedong Thought as an arrow to shoot at my personalistic thoughts, determined to take the martyrs as an example, to fight selfishness everywhere, and to thoroughly uproot the bad thoughts of seeking fame and profit. Whether the leadership praises or criticizes, as long as it is for the revolution, one must work with all one's might.

	This incident made me realize that to study Chairman Mao's works well, one must bring out the dirty things in one's mind to the public, let them see the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, expose them, and disinfect them. Only in this way can one truly overcome old thoughts and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

    旧思想不打不倒
    五好战士　吴均
    我从学习中体会到，要想真正把毛泽东思想学到手，首先就要敢把自己“摆进去”，敢把头脑中的资产阶级脏思想“亮出来”。敢不敢“亮”，是敢不敢自我革命的问题。也是用毛泽东思想改造自己的一个突破口。口子撕不开，就打不了纵深战，更谈不到全歼“敌人”。
    去年，我到某地执行任务，不小心，把右手砸伤了。领导上劝我休息，但我一想到入伍以来，经常受到表扬，还是咬着牙坚持干。这样一连干了十多天，不但没受表扬，连提都没有提一下我的名字。我心里很不痛快。但我马上意识到：工作上图表扬，这是个人主义私心杂念在作怪，正是毛主席所批评的那种人：“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。”对自己这个臭思想，几次想把它“亮”出来，可是又一想，自己是连里学习毛主席著作积极分子，几天前还介绍过经验。要是亮出来了，同志们岂不笑话？斗争的结果还是决定偷偷改掉。谁知道个人主义就像霉菌一样，越不敢晒太阳，就越繁殖得厉害。虽然我用很大的毅力克制了图表扬的思想，可是个人主义算盘在脑袋里还是打得哗哗响。是什么原因呢？我带着这个问题，请教毛主席著作。毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”毛主席的教导，一下子解脱了我头上的紧箍圈。我认识到错误思想也是不打不倒的，便鼓起勇气在班务会上把自己的脏思想全部端了出来。同志们不但没有笑话我，反而积极热情地帮助我。我又学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射我个人主义思想之“的”，决心以先烈为榜样，处处狠斗私心，彻底挖掉图名图利的坏思想。不管领导上表扬还是批评，只要是为革命，都要一股劲地干。
    这件事使我认识到，要学好毛主席著作，就要把自己头脑里的脏东西拿到大庭广众之中，让它见见毛泽东思想的阳光，晒一晒，消一消毒。只有这样才能真正克服旧思想，才能真正把毛泽东思想学到手。
