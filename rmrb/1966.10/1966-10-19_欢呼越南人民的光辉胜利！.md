The heroic military and civilian people of North Vietnam, by October 14th, have shot down 1,500 American aggressor planes. The Vietnamese people are fighting fiercely and effectively! This is a magnificent achievement in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. It is a living proof of the Vietnamese people's ability to defeat the American aggressors. The Chinese people enthusiastically hail this great victory of the fraternal Vietnamese people and extend their highest and most militant salute to the brave and skilled Vietnamese military and civilians!

Currently, the U.S. imperialists, who are at their wits' end in Vietnam, are desperately using the tactics of escalating the war and deceitful "peace talks" to counter the Vietnamese people. On the battlefield, the U.S. imperialists are accelerating their military adventurism, actively mobilizing troops, and the number of U.S. aggressor troops in South Vietnam has reached nearly 330,000, surpassing the number of troops they used in the Korean War. Their bombing of North Vietnam has become increasingly frenzied. At the same time, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership, along with their various followers, are jointly engaging in conspiracy activities for "peace talks" both domestically and internationally. The inspiring victory of the North Vietnamese military and civilians shooting down 1,500 American aggressor planes has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. plan to escalate military adventurism and has powerfully exposed the U.S. "peace talk" deception.

The U.S. imperialists have always boasted about their so-called "air superiority" to intimidate the revolutionary people of the world. On the battlefield of Vietnam, this myth has long been thoroughly shattered! The fact that the North Vietnamese military and civilians have shot down 1,500 planes proves once again that the U.S. Air Force is nothing to be afraid of. The Vietnamese military and civilians, relying on revolutionary heroism, the will to fight to the end, and the strategy and tactics of people's war, have beaten the American air pirates to a pulp. The U.S. imperialists are nothing but paper tigers. The U.S. "air superiority" is also nothing but a paper tiger.

Chairman Mao said: "All the people of the world, unite! All the people of the world, fight! Down with U.S. imperialism and all its running dogs! All the people of the world, be brave and fight! Don't fear difficulties and sacrifice! The whole world belongs to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be driven out." The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation has already achieved great victories, making a tremendous contribution to the world people's anti-imperialist revolutionary cause and receiving strong support from the people of the world. The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as the Vietnamese people continue their efforts and carry the war of resistance against American aggression to the end, they will definitely be able to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory!

    欢呼越南人民的光辉胜利！
    本报评论员
    英雄的越南北方军民，到十月十四日为止，已经打下了美国强盗飞机一千五百架。越南人民打得狠，打得好！这是越南人民抗美救国战争所取得的辉煌战果。这是越南人民有力量战胜美国侵略强盗的活生生的证明。中国人民热烈欢呼兄弟的越南人民的这一伟大胜利，并且向英勇善战的越南军民致以崇高的、战斗的敬礼！
    目前，在越南处于穷途末路的美帝国主义，正在拚命地用扩大战争和“和谈”欺骗的反革命两手，来对付越南人民。在战场上，美帝国主义加速扩大军事冒险的部署，积极调兵遣将，美国侵略军在南越的人数已经接近三十三万，超过了它在侵朝战争中使用的兵力。它对越南北方的轰炸，越来越疯狂。同时，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，以及它们的形形色色的追随者，在联合国内外，大搞“和平”谈判的阴谋活动。越南北方军民打下一千五百架美国强盗飞机的令人鼓舞的胜利，既沉重地打击了美国扩大军事冒险的计划，又有力地回答了美国“和平谈判”的骗局。
    美帝国主义一贯吹嘘它的所谓“空中优势”，来吓唬世界革命人民。在越南战场上，这种神话早就被彻底粉碎了！越南北方军民打下一千五百架飞机的事实，再一次证明美国空军没有什么了不起。越南军民依靠革命英雄主义、决战决胜的意志和人民战争的战略战术，把美国空中强盗打得落花流水。美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。美国的“空中优势”也不过是一只纸老虎。
    毛主席说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”越南人民的抗美救国战争已经取得了伟大的胜利，为世界人民的反帝革命事业作出了巨大的贡献，并得到了全世界人民的有力支持。中国人民坚信，只要越南人民再接再厉，把抗美救国战争进行到底，就一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后胜利！
