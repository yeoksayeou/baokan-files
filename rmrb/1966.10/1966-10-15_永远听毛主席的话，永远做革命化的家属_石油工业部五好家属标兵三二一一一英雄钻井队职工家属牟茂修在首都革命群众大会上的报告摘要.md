I went to visit the 32111 Hero Drilling Team in June 1966. Upon arrival, I saw that the entire team of workers, regardless of day or night, rain or shine, were working tirelessly to prepare mud for drilling, in order to tap into the gas layer. Some workers had been on duty for over twenty hours straight without rest. I asked my husband, "Why are you all so enthusiastic?" He replied, "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have instructed us oil workers to quickly produce oil and gas. Therefore, everyone is working hard to contribute to the socialist construction of our motherland, to resist imperialism and revisionism, and to support Vietnam against America."

When I visited the 32111 team, I saw that the workers were very busy. I wondered, what can I do to help? I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings about serving the people wholeheartedly. So, I helped the comrades with washing, mending, cleaning vegetables, and sweeping the floor.

At that time, I thought: As a family member of an oil worker, I should also contribute to finding gas and oil, and to the socialist construction. However, I couldn't directly participate in the drilling work like the workers. What should I do? Just then, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: No matter how small one's abilities are, as long as one does something beneficial to the people, it is revolutionary work. So, starting from June 8th, I helped the workers wash clothes, bedding, sheets, and mosquito nets. I mended torn items and washed dirty ones. In just over ten days, I washed and mended over eighty items for more than ten workers. I also helped in the kitchen by cleaning vegetables and sweeping the floor, which allowed the workers to have more time to rest and focus on production.

On the evening of the 21st, around midnight, after I had finished sorting the day's vegetable and grain tickets and just lay down to rest, I was suddenly awakened by a loud explosion. I quickly got out of bed and saw that the drilling site was engulfed in flames, with the entire machine room and drilling platform surrounded by fire. The workers, without any fear, rushed into the fire to save the state's property. I saw that our "gas tiger" was in danger, and I was very worried. But I thought, at this critical moment, just being worried is not enough; I should contribute my strength to the battle. I remembered Lei Feng's words: In times of emergency, one should stand up; I also thought of Xiang Xiu Li, who set a shining example for us women by sacrificing her life to save state property. These two heroes gave me great strength. I rushed towards the burning drilling site and, together with the comrades, carried basket after basket of heavy powder to protect the wellhead. Soon, I was overcome by the heat and fumes, feeling dizzy and weak. Everyone from head to toe was covered in heavy powder, and our clothes were soaked. No one could recognize each other. I saw some workers rushing into the fire, one batch getting burned and carried out, another batch rushing in, just like soldiers charging into battle.

At this tense moment, I suddenly heard someone urgently calling my name, "Mou Maoxiu, your husband is injured, you should go and take care of him!" At that moment, my heart ached. I thought of my husband, born into a poor family, whose parents died early. Should I go to see him, or should I continue to fight the fire? No! I cannot think of personal matters; saving state property is more important. The fire is still raging. No! I cannot waver. White, an American, came to China for our liberation cause, sacrificing everything. His selfless spirit deeply moved me. I am still young; how can I think of personal interests when our country's property is in danger? My husband's injury pains me, but the loss of state property pains me more. Without national interests, where is personal interest? I did not go to see my husband. No matter how dizzy or weak I felt, I had only one thought: to fight the fire with the comrades until it was extinguished.

At this time, someone signaled that we no longer needed heavy powder but needed quilts. I immediately turned around and, together with the comrades, passed quilt after quilt to the cement truck to be soaked and then passed to the workers to use for closing valves and sealing the wellhead. I passed quilt after quilt with the comrades, and the workers rushed in batch after batch, finally extinguishing the fire at the wellhead. Then, I saw the comrades rescuing the injured and, together with them, brought bamboo stretchers to the drilling site. I also heard someone shouting, "Quick, bring water! Quick, bring water!" I immediately brought two basins and, together with the comrades, carried water to extinguish the fire in the machine room.

While carrying water, another comrade told me, "Mou Maoxiu, when the fire started, your husband was still calculating the pressure, and it was all burned." At that moment, I was carrying a basin of water, not knowing what to do. But I saw a comrade suddenly collapse to the ground, then get up, carry a few basins of water, and collapse again. This scene deeply moved me, and I gradually calmed down. As I carried water, tears streamed down my face. I thought, should I go and see him, is he dead or injured? No! I cannot go; we must win the final victory! I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "To struggle is to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, the suffering of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and it is a worthy death." Chairman Mao seemed to be by my side, giving me endless strength. I thought, even if my husband died, it would be glorious. Whether my husband is dead or injured, the fire has not been completely extinguished. I should do my best, take on the responsibility, and fight the fire with the comrades until it is extinguished. After thirty minutes of struggle, we finally extinguished the fire and saved the large gas well. In the battle against the fire, some class brothers were injured, and some class brothers sacrificed their lives. I will follow Chairman Mao's teachings to turn grief into strength and always be a revolutionary family member.

After the fire was extinguished, team leader Peng Jiazhi called for the 32111 team to assemble. I saw that Class 4 had no one left, and Class 1 had only a few people remaining. I thought of our class brothers who, for socialist construction and to protect state property, were injured and some sacrificed their lives. I was deeply saddened by the loss of these close class brothers. But their deaths were for the people's interests and were worthy deaths. Chairman Mao said, "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai," they lived greatly and died gloriously.

At this moment, the comrades told me, "All the injured comrades and your husband have been sent to the hospital." After good rescue and treatment, all the injured comrades and my husband were safe. I couldn't help but think of the suffering of workers in the old society and deeply felt that only in the great era of Mao Zedong could there be the workers' today! I have countless words of gratitude to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country for their care of us!

Why was I able to do this work? The main reason is that Mao Zedong Thought armed my mind, and the worker comrades also gave me a lot of help. But the Party and the people gave me the greatest glory. My glory should be attributed to the great Communist Party of China and to the great Mao Zedong Thought. I will turn grief into strength and carry on the unfinished tasks of the martyrs. Chairman Mao taught us, "Countless martyrs, for the people's interests, bravely sacrificed their lives in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their blood-stained path!" I will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and always be a revolutionary family member.

    永远听毛主席的话，永远做革命化的家属
    石油工业部五好家属标兵三二一一一英雄钻井队职工家属牟茂修在首都革命群众大会上的报告摘要
    我是今年六月六日从家乡到三二一一一队去探亲的。去了以后，看见全队工人同志不分白天黑夜，风里雨里，一股劲地在抢配泥浆，为打开气层作好准备。有的师傅连着干二十多个小时都不下班。当时我就问我爱人，你们干劲为什么这样大？他回答我说：“党中央和毛主席指示我们石油工人，要很快地拿出油、气来。所以大家都在用实际行动，为祖国社会主义建设和反帝反修，援越抗美，贡献力量。”我去三二一一一队探亲，看到工人同志们都很忙。我该做些什么呢？我记起了毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导，于是，我帮助同志们拆洗缝补，摘菜扫地……
    当时我想：我是一个石油工人的家属，也要和全队师傅一样为找气找油，为社会主义建设贡献一点力量，但是自己又不能像师傅他们那样，直接上班去打钳子、提卡瓦、开机器，究竟做些什么呢？正在这时候，我想起了毛主席的教导，一个人的能力有大小，干啥事情只要是对人民有利，都是干革命。所以，我从六月八号那天起，每天帮助师傅们洗衣服，洗铺盖，洗床单和蚊帐，见烂了的就补，见脏了的就洗，十多天给十几位师傅洗了八十多件、补了二十多件，还帮助厨房摘菜，扫地，卖菜票。这样使师傅们能抽出更多的时间休息好，集中精力搞好生产。
    二十一日晚上，十二点多钟，我清理完一天卖的菜票和粮票，刚倒在床上睡了不多一会，忽然听到轰的一声响，把我惊醒了。我一下子从床上翻起来，跑到门外一看，只见井场一片火海，天都红了半边，整个机房、钻台被大火包围，全队师傅临危不惧，往火海里直冲，抢救国家财产。当时，我看见我们的“气老虎”要受到损失了，着急得很。但我想：在这关键的时刻，光急也没有用，应该把自己的力量投入到战斗中去。我想起雷锋同志说的，在紧急的关头，要挺身而出；又想起向秀丽，她在我们女同志当中树立了光辉的榜样，为了抢救国家财产，牺牲了自己宝贵的生命。这两个英雄，给了我很大的力量。我就往燃着大火的井场跑去，跟同志们一起一筐又一筐地端重晶石粉，去保住井口。没多一会，我就被大火和一股臭气熏得头晕眼花，脚杆也软了。我们每个同志从头到脚都是重晶石粉，衣服也湿透了，谁也认不清是哪个。我看到有些师傅直往火海里冲进去，一批烧伤了，背出来，又一批冲了进去，和在战场上冲锋陷阵一个样子。
    正在这紧张战斗的时刻，我忽然听到有人用急促的声音喊我的名字，说：“牟茂修，你爱人受伤了，你快去照顾你爱人吧！”当时我心里非常难过，想起我爱人出生在穷苦家庭，父母亲死得很早。在这时，我是去看他呢，还是去灭火呢？不！我不能考虑个人问题，抢救国家财产要紧。眼前这么大的火还燃着。不！不！决不能动摇。白求恩同志是个外国人，他为了我们国家的解放事业，不远万里来到中国，牺牲自己的一切。他这种毫无自私自利之心的精神，对我教育很深，我还是青年，看到我们国家的财产受损失时，怎能考虑个人的利益？我爱人受伤我很痛心，但国家财产遭受损失我更痛心，没有国家利益，哪有个人利益？我就顾不得去看爱人，哪怕头晕眼花脚杆软，只有一个心眼，和同志们一起进行紧张战斗。我正在紧张救火的时候，我的爱人受伤了。我该怎么办呢？我记起了毛主席关于要奋斗就会有牺牲的教导，于是，我毫不动摇地继续和同志们一起向烈火搏斗，直到扑灭大火。
    在这时候，有人打手势，意思就是说，不要重晶石粉了，要被子。我又转身和同志们一起把棉被递到水泥车上去，打湿后再递给师傅们抢关闸门和堵井口用。我和同志们递了一床又一床的被子，师傅们一批一批地冲进去，终于把井口的大火扑灭了。接着，我看见同志们在抢救伤员，又和同志们拿了竹凉板到井场。又听见有人大声喊：“快送水来呀！快送水来呀！”我立即拿来两个脸盆，和同志们一起端水，扑灭机房的火。
    在端水的时候，又一个同志告诉我说：“牟茂修，你爱人火刚着时，他还在那里算压力，都烧坏了。”当时我端着一盆水，不晓得怎办了。可我眼前一个师傅猛地倒在地上，一下子又翻起来，端几盆水，又晕倒了。这情景使我感动很深，逐渐镇定了下来。我一边端水，一边流下了眼泪，心想：我是不是去看一下，他到底是死了还是受伤了？不！不能去，要争取最后的胜利！我又想起了毛主席的教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛主席好像在我的身边，给了我无穷的力量。我想，爱人即使死了，也是光荣的。不管我爱人是死了，还是负伤，这时候火还没有全部扑灭，我应该尽我的能力，把责任担起来，和同志们一起扑灭机房的烈火。经过三十分钟的搏斗，终于把大火扑灭了，保住了大气井。在同烈火斗争中，一些阶级兄弟光荣负伤，一些阶级兄弟英勇牺牲。我一定按照毛主席关于踏着先烈的血迹前进的教导，化悲痛为力量，永远做革命化的家属。
    大火扑灭以后，队长彭家治喊三二一一一队的人集合。我看见四班一个人都没有，一班也只剩下几个人。我想起我们的阶级兄弟为了社会主义建设，为了保护国家财产，有些人负伤，有的牺牲了自己的生命。我为那些亲密的阶级兄弟的牺牲感到万分悲痛。但是他们的死是为人民利益而死的，是死得其所。毛主席说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，他们生的伟大，死的光荣。
    正在这时候，同志们告诉我说：“所有负伤同志和你爱人，已经送到医院去了。”经过很好的抢救和治疗，所有负伤的同志和我爱人脱险了。我不由地想起旧社会的工人所受的苦，深深体会到，只有生长在伟大的毛泽东时代，才会有工人阶级的今天！我有千言万语也感谢不尽党中央、毛主席和全国人民对我们的关怀！
    我为什么能做这一点工作呢？最主要的原因是毛泽东思想武装了我的头脑，工人同志也给了我很多帮助。可是党和人民给了我最大的光荣。我的光荣应归功于伟大的中国共产党，归功于伟大的毛泽东思想。我要化悲痛为力量，把烈士们未完成的任务继承下来。毛主席教导我们说：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”我要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，永远做革命化的家属。（附图片）
