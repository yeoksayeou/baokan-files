According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th. The Chairman of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association and leader of the Cambodian delegation, Lan Neth, concluded his friendly visit to China and departed Shanghai by plane this evening to return to his country. Before his departure, he gave a written statement to our reporter, enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Lan Neth said, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought is shining more and more brightly over the entire world. All the people of the world, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are oppressed by imperialism and colonialism, love and praise Chairman Mao. They regard Chairman Mao as the greatest thinker of our times.

He said, relying on Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's correct views, the peoples of various countries who are fighting against imperialism will surely win victory, and imperialism will surely suffer defeat.

Lan Neth said, China is now in the midst of a great upsurge of the Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao. So many young men and women who have formed the Red Guards of Chairman Mao are the hope of the Chinese people and all the people of the world who love justice and peace. The Red Guard movement and the Cultural Revolution movement are both irresistible. They will have a great and profound impact on the whole world.

In discussing the Vietnam issue, he said, the Vietnamese people will win victory in their heroic struggle against the criminal aggression of U.S. imperialism. There will be no peace talks in Vietnam. The only way to restore peace in Vietnam is for the U.S. troops to withdraw immediately from South Vietnam, or for the Vietnamese people's struggle to continue until final victory is achieved, inflicting a thorough defeat on the U.S. troops.

He said, in the struggle of our Vietnamese brothers to defeat our common enemy, the Chinese people, the Cambodian people, and all the people of the world who love justice have given resolute and steadfast support to our Vietnamese brothers.

He finally said, the traditional friendship between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the People's Republic of China is indestructible. It flows on forever like the Mekong River and the Yangtze River.

    柬中友协主席兰·涅特赞扬我国文化大革命
    红卫兵是全世界人民的希望
    据新华社上海二十五日电　柬中友协主席、柬中友协代表团团长兰·涅特结束了在中国的友好访问，今晚乘飞机离开上海回国。他在临行前向本社记者发表书面谈话，热情赞颂毛泽东思想和中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    兰·涅特说，毛泽东思想的光辉正日益普照全世界。全世界人民，首先是受帝国主义和殖民主义剥削的亚非拉人民热爱和赞扬毛主席。他们把毛主席看成我们时代的最伟大的思想家。
    他说，依靠毛泽东思想，依靠毛主席的正确观点，正在和帝国主义斗争的各国人民必将获得胜利，帝国主义必将遭到失败。
    兰·涅特说，中国正处在毛主席发动的文化大革命蓬勃开展的高潮中。那么多的青年男女组成的毛主席的红卫兵，是中国人民以及世界上一切爱好正义与和平的人民的希望。红卫兵运动和文化革命运动一样，都是不可抵挡的。它们对全世界将会产生伟大的、深刻的影响。
    他在谈到越南问题时说，越南人民将在反对美帝国主义罪恶侵略的英勇斗争中取得胜利。在越南不会有任何和平谈判。在越南恢复和平的唯一途径是：要不美国军队立即从越南南方撤退，要不越南人民的斗争一直进行到取得最后胜利，使美国军队遭到彻底失败。
    他说，在越南兄弟为战胜我们的共同敌人作出的英勇斗争中，中国人民、柬埔寨人民以及全世界一切爱好正义的人民，给予了越南兄弟坚决的和始终如一的支持。
    他最后说，柬埔寨王国和中华人民共和国之间的传统友谊是不可摧毁的，它像湄公河和长江一样永流不息。
