The warriors of the 32111 drilling team have used their blood and lives to extinguish a massive fire and save the gas well. In this heart-pounding battle, some comrades were injured. They were heroes in the battle against the flames, and they are heroes in their struggle against their injuries.

"I Must Be Responsible to the Party and the People"

The heroes did not want to leave the fire-engulfed drilling site. Some injured comrades, who had just regained consciousness from their faint, shouted, "Put out the fire! Put out the fire!" and rushed back into the flames. The comrades from the civilian labor team responsible for rescuing the injured held them back, repeatedly advising, "Comrade, you are injured and cannot rush in again. Hurry to the hospital for treatment."

Half-conscious, Lei Hongbin refused to be carried onto the ambulance. He shouted, "Why are you taking me away? I want to save the well, save my comrades." When they put him on the ambulance, he struggled to get out, and as soon as one foot touched the ground, he fainted.

Severely injured Hu Debin repeatedly requested on the ambulance, "Let me get off! I am a Communist Party member. I must be responsible to the Party and the people. I cannot leave the drilling site."

In the dead of night, the car carrying the injured comrades sped along the winding mountain road towards the nearest county hospital.

The comrades escorting the injured were mostly young female workers who had just left school. They were so moved by the heroes' revolutionary spirit and noble character that they burst into tears.

Severely injured deputy commander and chief engineer of the mining area, Zhang Zhongmin, heard the crying and comforted them, "Don't cry. Struggle will bring sacrifices. Be strong. Chairman Mao's oil warriors are made of steel and can withstand any difficulty."

After emergency treatment, the injured comrades regained consciousness. When they learned that the great leader Chairman Mao and the dear Party had sent the best doctors to them in the middle of the night, they spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!" They said, "Only the Party and Chairman Mao truly care for us workers." Party member Wang Cunyu, tears streaming down his face, told deputy commander Lei Hongbin, "In the old society, I was exploited and suffered. Today, Chairman Mao cares so much for us workers. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, recover from my injuries, and return to the battlefield to contribute everything I have to the Party and the people."

In the hospital, the injured comrades never forgot to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to find gas and oil. Huang Chenghou was severely burned and could not lie down to sleep. For over forty consecutive days and nights, he sat with his arms raised. One night, in his dream, he returned to the well, and it seemed as if the commander told him, "Old Huang, your injury has not healed, you cannot work." He firmly requested, "Commander, can I at least sit by the well?" The commander still did not allow it... He woke up feeling sad.

Xu Yongmao's right hand was burned, and for over twenty days, he had to keep his hand suspended from the bed frame. In moments of unbearable pain, he sang loudly, "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsman." His love for the great leader made him forget his own pain.

Deng Muquan had burns covering 90% of his body. After being injured, he rolled into a sewage ditch, causing severe infection and multiple diseases. This steadfast oil warrior never uttered a sound of pain during treatment. Deputy commander Lei Hongbin brought him the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and he happily said, "Thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their care. I will follow Chairman Mao's words and overcome any difficulty."

Deng Muquan developed pulmonary edema and had difficulty breathing. Doctors took all measures to save him, but to no avail. As he was about to stop breathing, he mustered his last bit of strength to say, "Follow... Chairman Mao's... words... and... do..." As soon as he finished speaking, this most loyal warrior of Chairman Mao, this good son of the Party and the people, bid his final farewell.

Chairman Mao Gave Him Infinite Strength

Ran Shurong was in the hospital for less than forty-eight hours and had three consecutive episodes of shock. He then developed septicemia and toxic symptoms of the nervous system.

In his delirium, he repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party! Quick, go put out the fire, protect the gas well!" He even angrily criticized the doctors and nurses, "Why aren't you putting out the fire? Quick, charge with me!"

The doctors took many measures to try to restore his consciousness so he could receive treatment, but to no avail. They heard Ran Shurong repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao," and knew that he loved our great leader Chairman Mao the most and listened to Chairman Mao's words the most. So they shouted to Ran Shurong, "Chairman Mao has sent us to treat your illness."

As soon as Ran Shurong heard the name of the great leader Chairman Mao, he opened his eyes wide, looked at the doctors in amazement, and repeatedly said, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" The doctor handed him the medicine and said, "This is the medicine Chairman Mao has given you!" He immediately swallowed the medicine in large mouthfuls.

Ran Shurong, the son of a porter, loved Chairman Mao from a young age. Hearing that soldiers who fought and won battles could see Chairman Mao, he often twisted his father's and mother's arms, asking to join the army. As soon as he reached the age of service, he became a border guard. In 1956, the Central Visiting Group gave him a portrait of Chairman Mao, which he carried with him for ten years, looking at it several times a day. He would call out, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" every time, feeling the greatest happiness.

After Ran Shurong regained consciousness, his first request was, "Hang a portrait of Chairman Mao by my bed. I want to see him." The medical staff hung several portraits of Chairman Mao for him so that he could see Chairman Mao as soon as he opened his eyes.

Ran Shurong regarded eating and taking medicine as carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions and as a revolutionary need. Whatever the doctor told him to do, he did it. He used incredible willpower to lie on his stomach in bed for over forty days and nights.

His burns covered a large area, and every day when the bandages were changed, it felt like countless steel needles were piercing his body. But he never uttered a sound. He said, "Mai Xiande was injured in the head on the battlefield and still continued to fight. I want to learn from him and be a good warrior of Chairman Mao."

At the most painful moments, he opened his eyes wide, gazed at the portrait of Chairman Mao, and recited loudly, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

This was the voice of a great steel warrior of Chairman Mao, charging into the battlefield of pain on his sickbed.

After being transferred to another hospital, the doctors, in order to quickly heal his injuries so that he could go to Beijing to see the great leader Chairman Mao before National Day, decided to use the saltwater soaking treatment. The burned flesh touched the saltwater, making him shiver with pain. But Ran Shurong said, "I am not afraid of pain! As long as I can heal my injuries quickly and return to the battlefield, I would dare to jump into the fire."

A doctor was moved and said, "I am a specialist in burns and have never seen such a brave, optimistic, and strong person."

Heal the Injuries
Strengthen the Mind

As soon as Zhang Zhongmin entered the hospital, he eagerly said, "Quick, bring me the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' Now, I need to read Chairman Mao's books the most."

The next day, the doctor asked him, "To heal your burned hands, we need to cut off the scabs and transplant skin from your thighs to your hands. Are you afraid of the pain?" Zhang Zhongmin firmly replied, "Chairman Mao's oil warriors are not afraid of death, let alone pain! As long as I can save this pair of laboring hands, this pair of hands serving the people, it will be my greatest happiness."

After the surgery, Zhang Zhongmin, full of revolutionary spirit, told the doctors and nurses, "You are treating diseases for the revolution, and I am recuperating for the revolution. For a common purpose, we have come together. We are a combat team under the command of the great Mao Zedong Thought." His revolutionary spirit deeply moved the doctors and nurses. They wrote in the medical records, "Treating diseases for the revolution is the driving force for us, and it is also the highest evaluation given to us medical staff."

Zhang Zhongmin was severely burned, and whenever waves of intense pain attacked him, he repeatedly recited the great leader's quotations, "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, must boost our courage."

He insisted on studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every day. At first, his eyes could not open, so he asked the nurse to read to him over and over again. Later, when his eyes opened and he could sit up, he asked the doctor to make a small wooden frame to place the book on, in front of him to read. When he first used his stiff fingers to turn the pages, his heart was filled with joy! He excitedly said, "Chairman Mao! I can open your book to read again."

Zhang Zhongmin not only studied Chairman Mao's works diligently but also cared deeply about the study of other injured comrades. He proposed two tasks to his comrades: one was to heal the injuries, and the other was to arm the mind. He asked the nurse to find ten pieces of iron, wrote several quotations from Chairman Mao on them, and distributed them to the injured comrades to hang on their beds.

Under the education and inspiration of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the warriors quickly healed their burns and also strengthened their minds. With the great ideal of communism, they all expressed their desire to join the Party and the League. They said: In the future, they were willing to undergo a thousand, ten thousand tests of climbing the knife mountain and crossing the fire sea, and to contribute everything to the Party's cause.

On August 6, it was a day Ran Shurong would never forget. When the Party branch of the 32111 drilling team announced that the higher Party committee had approved his application to join the Communist Party of China, this steel warrior was overwhelmed with emotion. Despite the pain, he lay on the bed and wrote his oath with his burned hand:

"I am now a probationary party member and must study Chairman Mao's books diligently, follow Chairman Mao's words, establish the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people, and forever be a servant of the people."

On August 30, in the convalescent hospital, Huang Chenghou was also approved to join the Party. At the admission ceremony, he solemnly swore to Chairman Mao and the Party:

"I will follow Chairman Mao and dedicate my life to the revolution. I will forever follow Mao Zedong Thought to transform my thoughts and forever put revolutionary interests as my first life."

Ran Shurong and Huang Chenghou's oaths expressed the common wishes and determination of the heroic injured comrades of the 32111 drilling team. They deeply felt that it was the great Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured their growth; it was the great Mao Zedong Thought that commanded their battles; it was the great Mao Zedong Thought that guided them to overcome their pain. They were determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, to regard reading Chairman Mao's books as their first need in life, to quickly heal their injuries, return to the battlefield, and do their work even better, and to temper themselves to be even stronger in the struggle.

    毛主席的石油战士是硬骨头
    ——记同烧伤顽强斗争的32111钻井队的英雄伤员
    32111钻井队的勇士们以鲜血和生命，扑灭了大火，保住了气井。在这场惊心动魄的战斗中，有些同志光荣负伤了。他们在血战火海中是英雄，在同伤痛斗争中也是英雄。
   “我要对党对人民负责”
    英雄们不愿离开大火冲天的井场。有些伤员从昏迷中刚刚苏醒，就大喊着：“救火呵！救火呵！”又向火海冲去。负责抢救伤员的民工团的同志，拉住伤员不放，再三劝阻说：“同志，你受伤了，不能再冲了，赶快进医院治疗。”
    处于半昏迷状态的雷洪炳，不让人把他抬上救护车。他大声喊道：“你们为什么把我抬走，我要去救井，救同志。”把他抬上车，他又挣扎着下来，一只脚刚伸出车外，就昏过去了。
    身负重伤的胡德炳在车上一再要求：“让我下车吧！我是个共产党员，我要对党对人民负责。我不能离开井场。”
    深夜里，汽车载着伤员，沿着崎岖山路奔向附近的县医院。
    护送伤员的同志，大半是刚刚离开学校的年轻女工。她们被英雄们的革命精神和高尚品德，感动得哭了起来。
    负了重伤的矿区副指挥兼总工程师张仲珉听到哭声，安慰她们说：“不要哭。要奋斗就会有牺牲。要坚强些。毛主席的石油战士是硬骨头，天大的困难也顶得住。”
    伤员们经过急救，苏醒过来。当他们知道伟大领袖毛主席和亲爱的党，连夜给他们派来最好的医生的时候，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”他们说：“只有党和毛主席，才最爱护我们工人。”党员王存友流着热泪对副指导员雷洪炳说：“我在旧社会受剥削受苦。今天，毛主席这样关心我们工人，我一定听毛主席的话，养好伤，重返战斗岗位，为党和人民贡献出自己的一切。”
    在医院中，伤员们念念不忘执行毛主席的找气找油的指示。黄成厚烧伤较重，不能躺下睡觉。一连四十多个昼夜，他都平举双手，坐着休息。一天晚上，他在梦里回到井上，仿佛指导员对他说：老黄，你的伤还没有好，不能上班。他坚决地要求：指导员，不让我上班，我坐在井台旁边行不行？指导员还是不让……，他难过得醒了。
    许永茂烧坏了右手，一连二十多天，都得把手吊在床架上。在剧痛难忍的时候，他放声欢唱《大海航行靠舵手》。对伟大领袖的热爱，使他忘记了自己的伤痛。
    烧伤面积达到百分之九十的邓木全，受伤后又滚进污水沟，引起严重感染，并发多种疾病。这个坚强的石油战士，在治疗中从来不叫一声痛。副指导员雷洪炳送去《毛主席语录》，他高兴地说：“感谢党和毛主席的关怀。我听毛主席的话，再大的困难也能克服。”
    邓木全并发了肺水肿病，呼吸困难。医生采取一切措施，抢救无效。他快要停止呼吸的时候，还用力发出十分微弱的声音说：“按……毛主席……的……话……去……做……。”刚说完，这个毛主席最忠诚的战士，党和人民的好儿子，就和大家永别了。
    毛主席给了他无穷的力量
    冉树荣入院不到四十八小时，连续休克了三次。接着，又发生了败血症和中毒性神经症状。
    在昏迷中，他不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”“快去救火，保卫气井！”他甚至愤怒地批评医生和护士：“你们为什么不去救火？快跟我冲上去！”
    医生们采取了许多措施，努力使他首先恢复神智，接受治疗，但是不见效果。他们听到冉树荣不断高呼“毛主席万岁”，知道他最热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，最听毛主席的话，于是就对冉树荣喊道：“毛主席派我们给你治病来了。”
    冉树荣一听说伟大领袖毛主席，就睁大眼睛，惊异地看着医生，连声地说：“毛主席！毛主席！”医生拿着药告诉他：“这是毛主席给你的药！”他马上大口大口地把药吞下。
    搬运工人的儿子冉树荣，从小热爱毛主席。听说当解放军杀敌立功能见到毛主席，就经常扭着爸爸、妈妈，要求去参军。刚到服役年龄，他就当上了边防战士。一九五六年中央慰问团送给他的一张毛主席像，他一直带在身边十年，每天都要看几遍。他一边看，一边亲切地喊：“毛主席！毛主席！”每当这个时候，他就感到最大的幸福。
    冉树荣恢复神智后，提出的第一个要求是：“在我的床前，挂上毛主席像。我要看他老人家。”医护人员就给他挂了几张毛主席像，让他一睁开眼就能看见毛主席。
    冉树荣把吃饭、吃药……都看成是执行毛主席的指示，看成是革命的需要。医生要他怎么办，他就怎么办。他用惊人的毅力，在床上俯卧了四十多个昼夜。
    他的烧伤面积很大，每天换药，揭一次纱布，像无数钢针扎在身上。但是他从不叫一声。他说：“麦贤得在战场上脑部受了伤，还坚持战斗。我要向他学习，做一个毛主席的好战士。”
    最疼痛的时候，他睁大眼睛，凝望着毛主席像，一遍又一遍地高声朗诵：“下定决心，——不怕牺牲，——排除万难，——去争取胜利。”
    这是伟大的毛主席的钢铁战士在病床上向伤痛冲锋陷阵的声音。
    转院以后，医生们为了迅速治好他的伤，让他能在国庆节前到北京，去见伟大的领袖毛主席，决定采取盐水浸泡疗法。烧伤的皮肉一接触盐水，使他痛得发抖。但是，冉树荣说：“我不怕痛！只要能早日治好我的伤，重返战斗岗位，就是火海我也敢下。”
    一个医生感动地说：“我是搞烧伤专业的，从来没有见过这样勇敢、乐观、坚强的人。”
    把伤病养好
    把思想炼红
    张仲珉一进医院，就急切地说：“快把《毛主席语录》拿来，现在，我最需要读毛主席的书。”
    第二天，医生对他说：“为了医好你烧坏的双手，需要切掉痂皮，把大腿上的皮移植到手上，你怕不怕痛？”张仲珉坚定地回答：“毛主席的石油战士，死都不怕，还怕痛？！只要能挽救这一双劳动的手，为人民服务的手，就是我的最大幸福。”
    手术过后，张仲珉满怀革命激情地对医生和护士说：“你们为革命治病，我为革命养伤，为了一个共同的目的，我们走到一起来了。我们是在伟大的毛泽东思想指挥下的一个战斗的小组。”他的革命精神深深感动了医生和护士。他们在病历上写道：“为革命治病，这是鞭策我们的动力，也是给予我们医护人员的最高评价。”
    张仲珉烧伤严重，每当一阵阵剧痛向他袭来的时候，他不断地默诵着伟大领袖的语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    他每天坚持学习《毛主席语录》。最初，眼睛睁不开，请护士一遍又一遍地念给他听。后来眼睛睁开了，也能够坐起来了，就请医生做了一个小木架，放上书，搁在自己面前阅读。当他第一次用僵硬的手指，翻阅书页的时候，心里是多么高兴呵！他激动地说：“毛主席！我又能翻开您的书来读了。”
    张仲珉不仅自己努力学习毛主席著作，而且十分关心其他受伤同志的学习。他向战友们提出两条任务：一是养好伤；二是武装好思想。他请护士找来十块铁皮，写上几段毛主席语录，分别送给伤员，挂在他们的床头。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的教育鼓舞下，勇士们迅速治好了烧伤，也更加炼红了思想。他们怀着共产主义的伟大理想，纷纷提出了入党入团的要求。他们表示：今后，愿意经受一千次、一万次上刀山、闯火海的考验，为党的事业贡献出自己的一切。
    八月六日，是冉树荣终生难忘的日子。当32111钻井队党支部宣布上级党委批准接受他为中国共产党党员的时候，这位钢铁战士激动万分。他不顾疼痛，趴在床上，用烧伤的手，写下了誓言：
    “我现在是一名预备党员，更要苦读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，树立完全、彻底为人民服务的思想，永远作一个人民的勤务员。”
    八月三十日，在疗养院里，黄成厚也被批准入党。他在入党仪式上向毛主席、向党庄严宣誓：
    “我要跟着毛主席，干一辈子革命。我要永远按照毛泽东思想，改造自己的思想，永远把革命利益当成第一生命。”
    冉树荣和黄成厚的誓言，表达了32111钻井队的英雄伤员们的共同愿望和决心。他们深深地体会到：是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育他们成长；是伟大的毛泽东思想指挥他们战斗；是伟大的毛泽东思想指导他们战胜了伤痛。他们下定决心：一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把读毛主席的书当作自己生活的第一需要，要迅速把伤养好，重返战斗岗位，把工作做得更加出色，在斗争中把自己锻炼得更加坚强。
