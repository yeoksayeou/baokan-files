The vast cadres and community members of the Guyuan District in Ningxia, where Chairman Mao passed through during the Long March, have raised high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. They have overcome severe natural disasters such as drought, hail, pests, and waterlogging, achieving a bumper harvest of autumn grains and oilseed crops.

This year, Guyuan District has had over 200 days without significant rainfall. Faced with the severe drought, the cadres and community members studied articles such as "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Abolish Illusions, Prepare for Struggle." They armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, adopting the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who moved the mountains, and engaged in a tenacious struggle against the drought. They built irrigation canals, dredged rivers, constructed dams, dug wells, and tapped springs, working tirelessly to achieve victory in the anti-drought campaign. This year, the late-autumn crops that were replanted, supplemented, and re-sown across the district have mostly yielded good harvests.

    六盘山上红旗招展
    固原专区秋粮油料增产
    据新华社银川十七日电 毛主席长征时经过的宁夏六盘山区的固原专区的广大干部社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜严重的旱、雹、虫、涝等自然灾害，使秋粮和油料作物获得丰收。
    固原专区今年有二百多天没有下过透雨。在大旱面前，广大干部和社员学习《愚公移山》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，以愚公移山的精神，同干旱进行顽强的斗争。他们修渠引水，拦河筑坝，打井挖泉，艰苦奋斗，取得了抗旱斗争的胜利。今年，全专区增种、补种、复种的晚秋作物，大部分都获得好收成。
