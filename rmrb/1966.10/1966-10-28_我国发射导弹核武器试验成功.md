The missile flew normally, and the nuclear warhead accurately hit the target at the predetermined distance, achieving a nuclear explosion.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission warmly congratulate the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, and scientific and technical personnel who participated in this test. They highly praise the new achievements they have made in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

China's development of nuclear weapons is precisely to oppose the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail by the collusion of the United States and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people's mastery of missiles and nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression and for national salvation, to all revolutionary people around the world who are fighting bravely, and is a new contribution to the defense of world peace.

We once again solemnly declare that under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. China will continue to work with all peace-loving peoples and countries around the world to firmly strive for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

		October 27, 1966

		On October 27, 1966, China successfully conducted a test of a nuclear missile on its own territory. The missile flew normally, and the nuclear warhead accurately hit the target at the predetermined distance, achieving a nuclear explosion.

		This successful test marks that China's scientific and technological and national defense capabilities, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are developing at an even faster pace. This is another major achievement made by the Chinese people in further strengthening national defense, safeguarding the security of the motherland, and defending world peace.

		The People's Liberation Army, scientific and technological personnel, and the broad masses of workers have actively responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized politics, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and in the drive of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, grasped revolution and promoted production. They have displayed the spirit of self-reliance, striving for progress, collective wisdom, and great cooperation, ensuring the complete success of this test. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. It fully proves that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force and exert immense power.

		The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission extend warm congratulations to all the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who participated in this test, to the workers, engineering and technical personnel, scientific researchers, and all relevant personnel who have made contributions to China's development of missiles and nuclear weapons. They highly praise the new achievements they have made in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They hope that they will continue to make efforts, persevere, raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, create a new situation, and further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. They hope that they will achieve new and greater successes in the struggle to further strengthen China's national defense construction and realize national defense modernization.

		At present, the imperialists led by the United States and the revisionists centered around the leadership of the CPSU are in cahoots, tightening their collusion, and plotting to make a deal on the so-called issue of preventing nuclear proliferation to maintain their nuclear monopoly position and sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. China's development of nuclear weapons is precisely to oppose the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail by the collusion of the United States and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people's mastery of missiles and nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression and for national salvation, to all revolutionary people around the world who are fighting bravely, and is a new contribution to the defense of world peace.

		China conducts necessary and limited nuclear tests and develops nuclear weapons purely for defensive purposes, with the ultimate goal of eliminating nuclear weapons. We once again solemnly declare that under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will, as always, continue to work with all peace-loving peoples and countries around the world to firmly strive for the lofty goal of completely prohibiting and thoroughly destroying nuclear weapons.

    我们再一次郑重宣布，在任何时候、任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。中国将继续同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家一道，坚定不移地为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器而共同奋斗
    新华社十月二十七日讯　新闻公报
    一九六六年十月二十七日，中国在本国的国土上，成功地进行了导弹核武器的试验。导弹飞行正常，核弹头在预定的距离，精确地命中目标，实现核爆炸。
    这次试验成功，标志着我国的科学技术和国防力量，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，正以更大的速度向前发展。这是中国人民在为进一步加强国防力量、保卫祖国安全和世界和平方面取得的又一个新的重大成就。
    中国人民解放军、科学技术人员和广大职工，积极响应林彪同志的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，抓革命，促生产，发扬自力更生、奋发图强、群策群力、大力协同的精神，保证了这次试验的圆满成功。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。它充分证明毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量，发挥无比强大的威力。
    中国共产党中央委员会、国务院和中共中央军事委员会向参加这次试验的人民解放军全体指战员，向为我国发展导弹和核武器作出贡献的工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员致以热烈的祝贺，高度赞扬他们活学活用毛主席著作所取得的新成就。希望他们再接再厉，坚持不懈，把学习毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段，搞出新的局面，进一步促进人的思想革命化。希望他们在进一步加强我国的国防建设、实现国防现代化的斗争中，取得新的更大的成就。
    当前以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的修正主义者，狼狈为奸，加紧勾结，阴谋在所谓防止核扩散问题上做成交易，以保持它们的核垄断地位，破坏各国人民的革命斗争。中国发展核武器，正是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断和核讹诈。中国人民掌握了导弹和核武器，对于正在进行抗美救国战争的英雄的越南人民，对于全世界正在进行英勇斗争的革命人民是一个巨大的鼓舞，对于保卫世界和平是一个新的贡献。
    中国进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，完全是为了防御，其最终目的就是为了消灭核武器。我们再一次郑重宣布，在任何时候、任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。中国人民和中国政府将一如既往，继续同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家一道，坚定不移地为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而共同奋斗。
