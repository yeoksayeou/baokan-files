Beijing, forever in our hearts! Farewell to the capital, Chairman Mao, farewell!

"Farewell, red Beijing!"
"Farewell, golden Tiananmen!"

Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country, who came to the capital, bid farewell to Beijing with hearts full of joy for having seen the great leader Chairman Mao.

In the morning, several hundred Red Guards and revolutionary students from Xiangfan, Hubei, lined up and headed towards Beijing Railway Station. When the procession reached Dongdan, many turned back, stood on tiptoes, and gazed deeply at Tiananmen. Someone said, "Let us take one last look at the magnificent Tiananmen!"

"Before we leave, let us sing our hearts out by Chairman Mao's side one last time!" A group of female Red Guards from the half-work, half-study school of Xiangtan Textile Printing Factory, Chairman Mao's hometown, sat in a circle on the square of Beijing Railway Station and sang loudly, song after song, melody after melody. Thousands of songs could not express their excitement; thousands of melodies could not express their deep affection for Chairman Mao!

Students from Xi'an University of Technology formed a long line at Beijing Railway Station. At this precious moment of leaving Beijing, their hearts were filled with both excitement and complexity. Some wrote down their diaries of the last day by Chairman Mao's side. A Red Guard wrote: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, it is you who personally ignited the flames of the cultural revolution, it is you who forever share our breath and fate, it is you who care most about our revolutionary youth. I will not disappoint your expectations, I will forever advance on the course you have opened!"

Many students enthusiastically discussed the happy moments of seeing Chairman Mao, encouraging and inspiring each other to take Chairman Mao's care and hope back home as a lifelong motivation for struggle.

The train whistle blew, and the train was about to depart. At this moment, how can words describe the surging waves in our hearts? What an unforgettable Beijing! Here, we saw the great leader Chairman Mao; here, we gained the true essence of revolution; here, we were infected with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the capital...

Train, please go slower, just a little slower, let us take one last look at this heroic city and its heroic people!

"Goodbye, Beijing!" No, Beijing will forever stay in our hearts, because this is the center of the revolution, this is where Chairman Mao resides.

Train, fly faster!

At 10:49 AM on October 19, the train whistle blew, and a train bound for Guangzhou, carrying revolutionary students from various places, left Beijing Railway Station. More than a thousand hands waved out of the windows, saying goodbye to the people of the capital; more than a thousand pairs of eyes gazed deeply in the direction of Tiananmen.

Train, please go slower, just a little slower! Let us stay by Chairman Mao's side for a little longer, even if it's just a moment! Let us take one last look at the red capital, even if it's just a glance!

Beijing gradually disappeared from view. Only then did everyone shift their gaze to the inside of the carriage.

"Comrade, where are you from?"
"I am from Guangdong."
"Where are you from?"
"I am from Hunan."
"I am from Hubei."
"I am from Henan."

Someone said, "We come from all over the country, we are the happiest people in the world." These words struck a chord with everyone. Lin Dongqing, a student from the Communist Labor University in Chaozhou, Guangdong, said that his father was an old guerrilla fighter who joined the revolution in 1927 and followed Chairman Mao everywhere, but never had the chance to see him. In the happy days after liberation, the old man longed to see the great leader. Now, the wish of the older generation has been realized by the new generation. Lin Dongqing was so excited that he kept saying, "We are truly blessed!"

The train sped south, taking the happy youth back to their hometowns. What should be the first thing to do upon returning home? The first and most important thing is to report to the fellow villagers and comrades-in-arms about the situation of seeing Chairman Mao in detail. Then, turn the trust and care of the great leader into new fighting strength, resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Everyone talked enthusiastically, and despite the shaking of the train, many students took out their notebooks and wrote down their plans for after returning home.

Train, fly faster! The people and comrades-in-arms in our hometowns are waiting for us.

"When will this train arrive in Guangzhou?"
"When will this train arrive in Wuhan?"

People asked again and again, wishing the train had wings. But at this moment, people's feelings were so complex: Beijing was far away, yet they missed Beijing and Chairman Mao even more! A student said meaningfully, "Beijing, farewell! Chairman Mao, farewell!" These words sparked another round of heated discussion. Someone said that after this return from Beijing, they must study Chairman Mao's works diligently and work hard on the "use" aspect, turning the school into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. Someone said that they would strive to be an active participant in studying Chairman Mao's works and see Chairman Mao again in Beijing next year. Everyone encouraged each other, wishing for another chance to gather by Chairman Mao's side in the future.

### 北京，永远在我们心里

    北京，永远在我们心里
    向首都告别，毛主席再见！
    “再见了，红色的北京！”
    “再见了，金色的天安门！”
    从五湖四海来到首都的广大红卫兵和革命师生，怀着见到伟大领袖毛主席的幸福激情，向首都告别。
    早晨，湖北襄樊地区的几百名红卫兵和革命师生，整队走向北京车站。队伍到了东单，不少人回过头来，踮起脚尖，深情地眺望天安门。有人说：“让我们再看一眼吧，雄伟壮丽的天安门！”
    “要离开了，让我们在毛主席身边再一次尽情地歌唱吧！”来自毛主席故乡——湘潭纺织印染厂半工半读学校的一群女红卫兵，围坐在北京车站广场上放声高歌，一支又一支，一曲又一曲。千歌万歌，难以唱出她们激动的心情；千曲万曲，难以表达她们对毛主席的无比深情！
    西北工业大学来京师生，在北京车站排成了长长的队伍。在即将离开北京的宝贵时刻里，他们的心情激动又复杂，有人写下了在毛主席身边最后一天的日记。一个红卫兵这样写道：“毛主席啊，毛主席，是您亲自点燃了文化革命的烈火，是您永远和我们同呼吸共命运，是您最关怀我们革命的青少年，我一定不辜负您的期望，一定在您开辟的航道上，永远前进！”不少同学在热情洋溢地谈论着见到毛主席的幸福时刻，大家相互鼓舞，相互启发，要把毛主席的关怀和希望带回去，当作终身奋斗的动力。
    汽笛长鸣，列车要出发了。这时的心潮呀，怎能用文字来描写？！多么难忘的北京城啊！在这里，见到了伟大的领袖毛主席；在这里，取得了革命的真经；在这里，感染了首都人民的革命热情……。火车呀，你慢点开，你开得慢一点啊，让我们再看看这英雄的城市，再看看这里英雄的人民！
    “别了，北京！”不，北京永远留在我们的心中，因为这是革命的中心，这是毛主席居住的地方。
    列车，飞快地奔驰吧！
    十月十九日上午十点四十九分，汽笛长鸣，一列去广州的火车，满载着各地的革命师生，离开北京车站。一千多只手伸出车窗，向首都人民频频招手；一千多双眼睛，深情地朝着天安门方向眺望。
    列车啊，你开慢一点，再慢一点吧！让我们在毛主席身边多待一会儿，那怕是一会儿！让我们把红色首都再仔细地看上一眼，那怕是一眼啊！
    北京城渐渐看不见了。这时，大家才把视线转到车厢里面。
    “同志，你是那里的？”
    “我是广东的。”
    “你是那里的？”
    “我是湖南的。”
    “我是湖北的。”
    “我是河南的。”
    不知那个同学说了这么一句：“我们来自五湖四海，我们都是世界上最幸福的人。”这话说得好，说到了每个人的心里。广东潮州共产主义劳动大学学生林冬青说，他的父亲是一个老游击队员，一九二七年参加革命，就跟着毛主席走南闯北，可是一直没有机会见到毛主席。在解放后的幸福日子里，老人家想念着毛主席，一直想见一见伟大的领袖。现在，老一辈没有实现的愿望，由新一辈实现了。林冬青多么激动啊，他连声说：“我们真是太幸福了！”
    列车向南飞驰，把幸福的青年人带到自己的家乡去。到了家乡，第一件事应该干什么呢？第一件事也是最最紧要的事，就是要把见到毛主席的情况，原原本本地向乡亲们汇报，向战友们汇报。紧接着，要把伟大领袖的信任和关怀化为新的战斗力量，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。人们尽情地谈论着，尽管火车在震动，许多同学还是拿出笔记本，把自己回去以后的打算写下来。
    列车啊，更快地飞驰吧！家乡人民和战友们在等待着我们。
    “这列车什么时候到广州啊？”
    “这列车什么时候到武汉啊？”
    人们问了一遍又一遍，恨不得火车长上一对翅膀。但是，人们的心情这时多么复杂：北京离远了，又想北京，更想毛主席啊！有一个同学意味深长地说：“北京，再见！毛主席，再见！”这话又引起了一阵热烈的议论。有人说，这一次从北京回去以后，一定要刻苦地学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，一定把学校办成毛泽东思想的大学校。有人说，回去争取做一个学习毛主席著作的积极分子，来年上北京再见毛主席。大家互相勉励着，祝愿将来再有机会来到毛主席身边聚会。
