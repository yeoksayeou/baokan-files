Comrades in Cai Yongxiang's former platoon, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have resolved to take Comrade Cai Yongxiang as their model, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more effectively, and to serve the people wholeheartedly.

	On October 26, the company where Comrade Cai Yongxiang served held a rally to learn from his example. All the soldiers and officers in the company vowed to learn from Comrade Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, serving the people wholeheartedly, and fearlessly facing danger. They pledged to defend the ironclad proletarian state of socialism.

	Comrade Cai Yongxiang had an infinite respect for Chairman Mao and an infinite love for Chairman Mao's works. The photographs show some of the books by Chairman Mao and other heroic figures that Comrade Cai Yongxiang had read.
