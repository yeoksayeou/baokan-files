Students from Dalian Maritime University, fifteen in total, formed the "Long March Red Guards" squad, taking the Red Army as their example, crossing mountains and rivers, spending a month on the journey, covering two thousand miles, and walking from Dalian to Beijing.

The Great Link-up is a great creation of the masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao has always been strongly supportive of the Great Link-up and advocates for the widespread promotion of this revolutionary action.

Students from universities and colleges across the country, and some from middle schools, coming to the capital for the Great Link-up, and students from various places linking up with each other, is one of the best ways for students to educate themselves. In the revolutionary school of the Great Link-up, students can familiarize themselves with society, with the masses, with class struggle, and withstand storms and waves, gaining various tempering experiences.

The revolutionary students from Dalian Maritime University, not taking trains or cars, marched on foot for the Great Link-up, which is another significant innovation. We sincerely congratulate these revolutionary students on the success of their Long March exercise and hope that students from other places, under voluntary and possible conditions, will also do the same.

Chairman Mao said: "The Long March is a manifesto, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a seeder." The students who walked from Dalian to Beijing, following Chairman Mao's teachings, studied, propagated, and did mass work while marching. Wherever they went, they propagated Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the Party Central Committee's Sixteen Points, spreading the seeds of Mao Zedong Thought to the cities and villages along the way. The masses praised them as "loyal little red soldiers of Chairman Mao," "descendants of the old Red Army and the old Eighth Route Army," and "propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought."

These students who walked to Beijing, like the PLA, strictly followed the three disciplines and eight points of attention formulated by Chairman Mao, learned from the masses, and did good deeds for the masses. Whenever they arrived at a place, they visited old workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, listened to revolutionary predecessors telling their stories of struggle and liberation. Despite the fatigue of the journey, they carried water, swept the floor, did odd jobs, participated in the autumn harvest, and truly blended in with the masses.

The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause must go through hardships and trials. They must not be like greenhouse flowers that cannot withstand wind and rain; instead, they must be like sturdy pines on the mountains, daring to face the challenges of storms and tempests. The students who walked from Dalian to Beijing deeply felt: Although we left the bright classrooms, comfortable beds, and superior living conditions, and gave up convenient means of transportation, we have gained a great liberation, tempering, and elevation in our thoughts.

Indeed, those who do not plan to struggle hard cannot become true revolutionaries. Those who want to "revolutionize comfortably" may "peacefully evolve" and slip into the swamp of revisionism.

The proletarian revolutionary cause, the communist cause, is the greatest and most arduous cause in human history. The task is heavy, and the road is long. We, the younger generation, must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. We must inherit and pass down the revolutionary tradition of "The Red Army fears not the difficulties of the Long March, ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains are but trifles" for generations to come.

### 红卫兵不怕远征难

    红卫兵不怕远征难
    大连海运学院，有十五个革命学生，组成了“长征红卫队”，以红军为榜样，跋山涉水，历时一个月，行程两千里，从大连步行到了北京。
    大串连，是群众在无产阶级文化大革命中的伟大创造。我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，一直是极力支持大串连的，并且主张把这种革命行动大大推广。
    全国大专学校的学生，中学的一部分学生，到首都来串连，各地的学生互相串连，这是学生自己教育自己的最好方式之一。学生们在串连的革命大学校中，可以熟悉社会，熟悉群众，熟悉阶级斗争，经受大风大浪，得到种种锻炼。
    大连海运学院的革命学生，不坐火车汽车，徒步行军进行大串连，这又是一个很有意义的创举。我们衷心祝贺这些革命学生长征演习的胜利，并且希望各地的革命学生，在自愿和可能的条件下，也这样做。
    毛主席说：“长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机。”从大连步行到北京的学生，根据毛主席的教导，边行军，边学习，边宣传，边做群众工作。他们走到哪里，就在哪里宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命，宣传党中央的十六条，把毛泽东思想的种子传播到沿途的城市和乡村。群众称赞他们是“毛主席的忠实红小兵”，“老红军、老八路的红后代”，“毛泽东思想的宣传队”。
    这些步行来京的学生，像解放军那样，坚决遵守毛主席制定的三大纪律八项注意，向群众学习，为群众做好事。他们每到一地，就访问老工人和贫下中农，听革命前辈讲述斗争史，翻身史。他们不顾旅途的疲劳，为群众担水，扫地，干零活，参加秋收，真正和群众打成一片。
    无产阶级革命事业的接班人，一定要经过艰难困苦的磨炼。他们决不能做温室里的花朵，经不起风吹雨打；而要做高山上的劲松，勇于迎接暴风雨的挑战。大连步行来京的学生深有体会地说：我们虽然离开了明亮的教室，舒适的床位和优越的生活条件，抛开了方便的交通工具，但是在思想上得到了一次大解放，大锻炼，大提高。
    事实正是这样，不打算艰苦奋斗的人，不可能成为真正的革命者。谁想要“舒舒服服地干革命”，谁就可能“舒舒服服地和平演变”，滑到修正主义的泥坑中去。
    无产阶级革命事业，共产主义事业，是人类历史上最伟大也是最艰巨的事业。任重而道远。我们青年一代，一定要永远忠实于毛主席，忠实于毛泽东思想，忠实于党，忠实于人民，把“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的革命传统，继承下来，千秋万代地传下去。
