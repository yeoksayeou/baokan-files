The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, following their great victories in the 1965-1966 dry season, have further demonstrated the boundless power of people's war in the past six months. They have bravely fought and annihilated 21 enemy battalions and regiments, including 7 U.S. infantry battalions and 3 armored and tank regiments of the U.S. aggressors.

After suffering heavy losses in the "dry season offensive" of 1965-1966, the U.S. aggressors continued to send more than 100,000 additional troops to South Vietnam and actively prepared for a new and larger "dry season counteroffensive" in 1966-1967. However, the situation this rainy season shows that the enemy is becoming more and more passive. The Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have launched continuous attacks on the enemy, annihilating a large number of enemy troops. The so-called "Big Red One" U.S. First Infantry Division on the 13th Highway in the South Central region has suffered a fatal blow; the so-called "Tropical Lightning" U.S. 25th Infantry Division has suffered heavy losses as soon as it set foot in the South; the U.S. First Cavalry Division, Marine Corps, 173rd Airborne Brigade, and 101st Airborne Division have all fallen into a passive situation of being beaten. In addition, important U.S. military bases such as Da Nang and Qui Nhon, as well as military defenses on the 13th Highway, have fallen into the encirclement of guerrilla forces and are frequently attacked by the main forces of the people's armed forces, suffering heavy losses.

The above brilliant victories of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have further pushed the U.S.-puppet clique into a passive and failing situation, making their so-called "pacification plan" a failure. The liberated areas in the South have further expanded.

The brilliant achievements of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam in the past six months further demonstrate their rapid growth. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam have enough strength to defeat the enemy under all conditions and on all battlefields.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 11, the Vietnamese "People's Army" newspaper published an editorial on October 11, warmly applauding the great victory of the heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam in annihilating 21 enemy battalions and regiments in the past six months.

The editorial pointed out that this great victory once again proves: the war waged by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam is not seasonal, and the enemy can be beaten at any time and place.

The editorial said that the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the past period have laid the foundation for achieving even greater victories in the coming period.

    在旱季能打，在雨季更能打　见伪军要歼，见美军更要歼
    南越军民六个月来歼敌二十一个营和战团
    美国侵略军被歼七个步兵营和三个坦克、装甲车战团
    新华社河内十二日电　据越南通讯社报道：英雄的越南南方军民，继一九六五——一九六六年旱季大捷以后的六个月来，进一步发挥人民战争的无穷威力，英勇战斗，共歼灭美伪军和帮凶军二十一个营和战团，其中包括美国侵略军七个步兵营和三个坦克、装甲车战团。
    一九六五——一九六六年的“旱季攻势”遭到惨重失败后，美国侵略军继续向越南南方增派了十多万兵力，并且积极准备在一九六六——一九六七年的旱季中，发动一次新的规模更大的“旱季反攻”。但是，今年雨季以来的战况表明，敌人越来越被动。越南南方解放武装力量在这期间，向敌人发起连续不断的进攻，歼灭了敌人大批有生力量。号称“大红一”的美国第一步兵师在南部东区的十三号公路上受到了致命的打击；号称“热带闪电”的美国第二十五步兵师刚刚踏上南方的土地就遭到惨重的失败；美国第一骑兵师、海军陆战队、第一七三空降旅、第一零一空降旅也都陷入了被动挨打的处境。此外，美国侵略军的重要基地岘港，古芝以及十三号公路上的军事防线，陷入了游击队的歼美包围圈，并且经常遭到人民武装主力部队的袭击，损失惨重。
    南越军民的上述光辉的胜利，使美伪集团进一步陷于被动和失败的境地，使他们的所谓“绥靖计划”遭到破产。南方解放区进一步扩大了。
    越南南方军民六个月来取得的辉煌战果，进一步表明了越南南方军民的迅速成长。越南南方军民有足够的力量，在一切条件下，在一切战场上战胜敌人。
    据新华社河内十一日电　越南《人民军队报》十一日发表社论，热烈欢呼英雄的越南南方军民在最近六个月内歼敌二十一个营和战团的巨大胜利。
    社论指出，这一巨大胜利再一次证明：南越军民所进行的战争是不分季节的，敌人随时随地都可以被打得焦头烂额。
    社论说，越南人民在过去期间取得的巨大胜利，为在即将到来的时间里取得更加巨大的胜利提供了前提。
