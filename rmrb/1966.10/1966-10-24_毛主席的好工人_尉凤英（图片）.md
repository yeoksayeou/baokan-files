During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wei Fengying, together with the broad revolutionary masses, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to sweep away all monsters and demons, vowing to defend the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong Thought to the death. She said, "Whoever opposes our great leader Chairman Mao and opposes the great Mao Zedong Thought, we workers, peasants, and soldiers will fight to the death!"

"Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our revolution. The more the enemy opposes and fears Mao Zedong Thought, the more we workers, peasants, and soldiers love and study Mao Zedong Thought diligently." Comrade Wei Fengying is deeply engrossed in reading Chairman Mao's books, drawing wisdom and strength from them.

In the face of achievements and honors, Wei Fengying never forgets Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one go forward, while conceit makes one lag behind." She remains humble and cautious, avoiding arrogance and impatience, and continuously learns from others, making progress.

		This is her exchange with Liao Chujian on the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Wei Fengying always puts revolutionary interests first and never allows personal issues to affect revolutionary work. She often organizes her entire family to study Chairman Mao's works, promoting the thought revolution among family members.

Wei Fengying often recalls and shares her family's history of suffering with her comrades, reminding herself and her comrades to never forget class hatred, to always remember class struggle, to always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, to love the Communist Party more, and to love Chairman Mao more.

A group of worker and peasant representatives who participated in the National Day celebration gathered to discuss their impressions of visiting the Wei Fengying exhibition. They resolved to learn from Comrade Wei Fengying, to bring back the good experience of studying Chairman Mao's works, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.
