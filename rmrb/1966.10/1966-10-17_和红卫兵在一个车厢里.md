	Many comrades from the People's Liberation Army have written to our newspaper, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary spirit and noble character of the Red Guards. They commend them for truly being like the sun at eight or nine in the morning, full of vitality and brimming with revolutionary youthful energy, worthy of being the new generation of the Mao Zedong era. Many letters specifically introduce the touching deeds they witnessed during their interactions with the Red Guards. Now, we have selected three letters to publish excerpts as follows. — Editors

	With the Red Guards in the Same Carriage

	On September 5th, four of us from our unit boarded a train from Mianyang back to Beijing.

	That day, many passengers boarded the train from Mianyang. When we entered Carriage No. 3, it was already filled with Red Guard warriors. We were heading to the next carriage when we suddenly heard several people shouting, "Comrades from the PLA, there are seats here!" Looking back, we saw several Red Guards busy making room. We thought that sharing a journey with these revolutionary youngsters was a rare opportunity, so we happily sat down. When they learned that we were soldiers who had been stationed in Beijing for a long time, they asked how tall Tiananmen Gate was, how big Tiananmen Square was, and whether we could see Chairman Mao clearly during the parade? It seemed that their hearts had already flown to Tiananmen Gate and to Chairman Mao's side.

	After a while, according to their arrangement, we studied together Chairman Mao's quotations about class and class struggle. A Red Guard first proposed, "Under the direct leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, the PLA learned the earliest and used it the best. Please, comrades from the PLA, guide us." The surrounding Red Guards enthusiastically supported this proposal. Under their enthusiastic invitation, we reluctantly shared some of our own experiences.

	Along the way, many Red Guard warriors, like Lei Feng, were busy serving the passengers in the carriage. One Red Guard returning to Beijing would sometimes sweep the floor, sometimes deliver hot water, and his seat was mostly used by others as a bed. When others praised him, he would always modestly say, "I am just starting to learn, and in the future, I still need to learn more from the PLA." These young people are so humble and eager to learn!

专栏：红卫兵赞

    许多解放军同志给本报来信，热烈地赞扬红卫兵的革命精神和崇高的风格，称赞他们真正像早晨八、九点钟的太阳那样，生气勃勃，充满革命的青春活力，不愧是毛泽东时代的一代新人。不少来信里，具体介绍了他们和红卫兵接触中看到的动人事迹。现在，我们选出三封来信，摘要发表如下。　——编者
    和红卫兵在一个车厢里
    九月五日，我们部队的四个人，从绵阳乘火车返回北京。
    这天，从绵阳上车的旅客很多。当我们走进三号车厢时，里面已坐满了红卫兵战士。我们正往前一节车厢走，忽然听到好几个人在喊：“解放军同志，这里有座位！”回头一看，好几个红卫兵正在忙着腾位子。我们想，能同这些革命小将共同过一段旅途生活，是一个难得的机会，便欣然坐了下来。当他们知道了我们是久住北京的战士，便问天安门城楼有多高？天安门广场有多大？游行的时候，能不能看清毛主席？……看来，这些革命小将的心早已飞向天安门，飞到毛主席身边了。
    过了一会儿，按照他们的安排，我们一道学习了毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的语录。一个红卫兵首先提出：“在林彪同志直接领导下，解放军学得最早，用得最好。请解放军同志给我们辅导辅导。”周围几个红卫兵热烈拥护这个动议。在他们热情邀请下，我们勉为其难地讲了一些自己的体会。
    一路上，好多红卫兵战士像雷锋那样，在车厢里忙着为旅客服务。有一位回北京去的红卫兵，时而扫地，时而送开水，他的座位大部分时间让给别人当睡铺了。当别人称赞他的时候，他总是谦虚地说：“我才开始学着做，今后还得好好向解放军学习。”这些青年人是多么谦逊好学呵！
