The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has aroused a strong response among the Japanese people. Many Japanese friends have expressed their views, enthusiastically praising this great proletarian cultural revolution, which is personally led by Chairman Mao and has great historical significance.

Recently returned from a visit to China, Bamboo Motoyoshi, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Teachers' Union, said, "This time I went to China and saw with my own eyes that the 700 million Chinese people are organized and full of fighting spirit. Their socialist morality is noble, and their socialist consciousness is very high."

Taki no Oko, a teacher at the 10th Middle School in Tokyo's Bunkyo Ward, said, "During my visit to China, the most striking impression was the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people. In particular, the Red Guards' vigorous spirit, their confidence in the future, and their firm determination to carry the revolution through to the end."

Mori Mikio, a teacher at Tokyo Municipal Taito Commercial High School, said, "The most vivid impression I have is of the vigorous Chinese youth and Red Guards, full of confidence, actively participating in the cultural revolution. After reading the 'Sixteen Points' issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I feel even more strongly that the revolutionary mass movement, formed by believing in the masses and mobilizing them, has cultivated countless reliable revolutionary successors."

Small Lin Liangxiong, leader of the delegation from the Osaka-China Friendship Institute, who is striving to visit China to participate in the second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival, said that the cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao and the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are aimed at uprooting revisionism in China. Only by ensuring that the working class takes the lead and carries out continuous revolution can the country be guaranteed to remain unchanged.

Huo Dongzi, a graduate of the senior department of the Osaka-China Friendship Institute, said, "Before coming to Tokyo to participate in the struggle for visas to visit China, I reread Chairman Mao's 'Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan' and the 'Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.' I feel that these are great historical documents that touch people's souls. The education they provide is very profound."

Xiang Jian Xiao, a member of the Shimonoseki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association's Yamaguchi Prefecture Federation, said, "This cultural revolution is indeed a great revolution that touches people's souls. Only today's socialist China can achieve this."

    中国人民革命气势磅礴
    日本朋友热情赞扬红卫兵坚定的革命精神
    据新华社讯　东京消息：中国的无产阶级文化大革命在日本人民心中引起了强烈的反响。许多日本朋友纷纷发表谈话，热情赞扬这场由毛主席亲自领导的、具有伟大历史意义的无产阶级文化大革命。
    不久前访华归来的东京都教职员工会的竹本良美说，“我这一次到中国亲眼看到中国七亿人民是有组织的，是富有战斗精神的。他们的社会主义的道德是高尚的，社会主义觉悟是很高的”。
    东京都文京区立第十中学教员泷尾纪子说，“访华期间，印象最为强烈的是：中国人民的革命气势。特别是红卫兵那种生气蓬勃、对未来充满信心、坚定革命到底的精神”。
    东京都立台东商业高等学校教师森幹夫说：“朝气勃勃的中国青年们、红卫兵们满怀信心地活跃在文化大革命运动中，给了我最强烈的印象”。他说：“在读了中国共产党中央委员会公布的（关于无产阶级文化大革命的）十六条以后，越发感到，由于相信群众和放手发动群众而形成的革命的群众运动，培养了无数完全可以信赖的革命接班人”。
    正在争取访华参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的大阪日中友好学院代表团团长小林良雄说，毛主席亲自领导的中国文化大革命和红卫兵的革命行动，是为了在中国挖掉修正主义的根子。只有工人阶级当家作主之后进行不断革命，才能保证国家永不变色。
    大阪日中友好学院高等部毕业生后等顺子说，“来东京参加争取访华护照斗争前，又重读了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，感到这是充满伟大气魄的触及人们灵魂的光辉的历史文献。对我们的教育是十分深刻的”。
    日中友好协会山口县联合会下关分会的相见佳孝说，“这次文化大革命的确是触及人们灵魂的大革命，这只有今天的社会主义中国，才能做到。”
