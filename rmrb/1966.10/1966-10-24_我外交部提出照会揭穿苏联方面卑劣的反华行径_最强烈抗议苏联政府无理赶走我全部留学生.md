China's Foreign Ministry Issues Note Exposing the Soviet Side's Vile Anti-China Actions
Strongest Protest Against the Soviet Government's Unreasonable Expulsion of All Chinese Students

The note sternly points out: The Soviet government's brazen violation of the Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation agreement is not an isolated incident. Recently, the Soviet leadership has meticulously planned a new global-scale anti-China movement. Soviet publications have maliciously slandered and attacked the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, spreading rumors and defaming the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the same time, the Soviet government has taken a series of steps to worsen relations between the two countries. All of this once again exposes the Soviet side's hypocrisy in advocating anti-imperialist "joint actions," while their joint actions with the U.S. imperialists to oppose China are genuine.

	New China News Agency, October 23rd: On October 22nd, Yu Zhan, Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, Razdukhov, and handed him a note. The note strongly protests the Soviet authorities' escalation of anti-China activities and worsening of Sino-Soviet relations, and the unreasonable decision to suspend all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires, cornered and at a loss for words, refused to accept the note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Yu Zhan expressed deep regret at this unreasonable attitude.

	The note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry states that according to a notice from the Soviet Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education on October 7, 1966, the Soviet government unilaterally decided to suspend all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union and ordered them to leave the Soviet Union by the end of October this year. This is a serious incident in which the Soviet government brazenly violates the Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation agreement and further worsens relations between the two countries.

	This incident was deliberately created by the Soviet government. On September 20, 1966, the Ministry of Higher Education of the People's Republic of China notified the Soviet Embassy in China that due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in Chinese institutions of higher learning, all Chinese institutions of higher learning have suspended classes, and all foreign students in China have been suspended for one year. Those who are scheduled to graduate this summer and at the end of this year can graduate early. The Soviet students in China, who were originally scheduled to graduate at the end of this year, have basically completed their main courses and can graduate early. The graduation time will be determined in principle with the Soviet side, and then the schools will determine the specific time with each student based on their academic progress. Despite repeated inquiries from the Chinese side, the Soviet side has not responded, but instead recalled the Soviet students in China on their own. On the very day the Soviet students returned home, the Soviet government falsely accused the Chinese government of unilaterally deciding to suspend the Soviet students in China and, on the pretext of the so-called principle of reciprocity, suddenly announced the decision to order all Chinese students in the Soviet Union to leave within a specified time.

	The note states that the Soviet authorities' pretext is completely untenable. The whole world knows that China is currently undergoing a cultural revolution, and suspending classes for one year is not just for Soviet students in China, but for all foreign students in China. In the Soviet Union, there is no situation where all foreign students are suspended for one year. Unilaterally deciding to suspend Chinese students in the Soviet Union is clearly a discriminatory act aimed specifically at Chinese students.

	The Soviet leadership has long been plotting to disrupt the exchange of students between the two countries. For a long time, the Soviet side has made every effort to reduce the number of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union and has created various difficulties for their studies. They have unilaterally changed their majors, restricted their access to materials and practical training, fabricated excuses to expel them back to China, and even engaged in subversive activities against them. Now they have finally expelled all Chinese students. You are turning right and wrong upside down, trying to shift the blame for disrupting the exchange of students onto us, which is in vain.

	The note states that it should be pointed out that the Soviet government's expulsion of Chinese students is not an isolated incident. Recently, the Soviet leadership has meticulously planned a new global-scale anti-China movement. Soviet publications have published endless anti-China materials, maliciously slandering and attacking the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and spreading rumors and defaming the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the same time, the Soviet government has taken a series of steps to worsen relations between the two countries. All of this once again exposes your hypocrisy in advocating anti-imperialist "joint actions," while your joint actions with the U.S. imperialists to oppose China are genuine.

	The note concludes by stating that we strongly protest the Soviet side's vile anti-China actions and behavior that worsens relations between the two countries, and we have decided that Chinese students in the Soviet Union will leave Moscow and return to China on October 27th.

    我外交部提出照会揭穿苏联方面卑劣的反华行径
    最强烈抗议苏联政府无理赶走我全部留学生
    严正指出：苏联政府这次悍然破坏中苏文化合作协定并不是孤立事件，最近以来苏联领导精心策划新的世界规模的反华运动，苏联报刊恶毒诬蔑和攻击中国人民、中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，造谣诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命，同时苏联政府采取一系列恶化中苏两国关系的步骤。所有这些，再次暴露了苏方高唱什么反帝“联合行动”完全是骗人的鬼话，同美帝“联合行动”反华倒是货真价实的。
    新华社二十三日讯　中华人民共和国外交部苏联东欧司司长余湛，十月二十二日召见苏联驻华大使馆临时代办拉兹杜霍夫，交给他一份照会，就苏联当局加紧反华和恶化中苏关系，无理决定我国全部留苏学生休学事，向苏联政府提出最强烈抗议。苏联临时代办理屈词穷，竟拒绝接受我外交部的照会。余湛同志对这种无理态度，表示极大的遗憾。
    我外交部的照会说，据一九六六年十月七日苏联高等和中等专业教育部通知，苏联政府单方面决定中国全体留苏学生休学，并限令他们于今年十月份离开苏联。这是苏联政府悍然破坏中苏文化合作协定，进一步恶化中苏两国关系的严重事件。
    这个事件是苏联政府蓄意制造出来的。一九六六年九月二十日中华人民共和国高等教育部通知苏联驻华大使馆，由于中国高等院校正在进行无产阶级文化大革命，中国所有高等院校已全部停课，所有外国在华留学生休学一年，明年暑期和今年年底毕业的留学生可以提前毕业。苏联在华留学生原计划今年年底毕业，基本课程已经学完，可以提前毕业。毕业时间在与苏联方面原则商定后，再由学校根据各个学生的学习进度，与苏联学生具体商定。对此，尽管中国方面多次催询，苏联方面一直不予答复，却自行将苏联留华学生召回。就在苏联学生回国的第二天，苏联政府竟诬赖中国政府单方面决定苏联留学生休学，并借口所谓对等原则，突然宣布勒令全体中国留学生限期离开苏联的决定。
    照会说，苏联当局的借口是完全不能成立的。全世界都知道，中国正在进行文化大革命，休学一年并不单对苏联在华留学生，而是对所有外国在华留学生。在苏联并不存在所有在苏外国留学生休学一年的情况，片面决定中国在苏留学生休学，分明是一种专门针对中国留学生的歧视行为。
    苏联领导破坏中苏两国交换留学生的关系，蓄谋已久。长期以来，苏联方面就对我国派遣留学生百般刁难，极力减少我国留苏学生的人数；对我国在苏留学生的学习制造种种困难，片面改变他们的学习专业，限制他们阅读资料和进行实习，制造借口把他们赶回中国，甚至对他们进行策反活动，现在终于把我国留学生全部赶回。你们颠倒是非，企图将破坏交换留学生关系的责任加在我们身上，这是枉费心机的。
    照会说，应该指出，苏联政府这次赶走中国留学生并不是一个孤立的事件。最近以来，苏联领导精心策划了一个新的世界规模的反华运动。苏联报刊连篇累牍地发表反华材料，对中国人民、中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席进行恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，对中国无产阶级文化大革命极尽造谣诽谤之能事。与此同时，苏联政府采取了一系列步骤，恶化中苏两国关系。所有这些，再次暴露你们高唱什么反帝“联合行动”完全是骗人的鬼话。同美帝“联合行动”反华倒是货真价实的。
    照会最后说，对于苏联方面卑劣的反华行径和恶化两国关系的行为，我们提出最强烈抗议，并决定中国在苏联的留学生于十月二十七日离莫斯科回国。
