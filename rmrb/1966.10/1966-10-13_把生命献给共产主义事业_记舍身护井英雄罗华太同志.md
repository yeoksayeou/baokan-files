"In the world, the sun is the most precious, and for people, Mao Zedong Thought is the most needed. We should be like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and carrying out the Chinese and world revolutions to the end."

This was written in the diary of Luo Huatai, the hero who sacrificed himself to protect the well in the 32111 drilling team. This hero, who was only twenty-four years old, started reading Chairman Mao's books eagerly from the day he joined the revolution. He listened to Chairman Mao's words seriously and followed Chairman Mao's instructions firmly. No matter where he was assigned, he always gave his best.

Luo Huatai's grandfather and father both worked as laborers for landlords to make a living. After liberation, when he started school, he remembered two phrases: "Never forget the Communist Party after liberation, forever follow Chairman Mao."

Work is Struggle

In 1960, Luo Huatai joined the People's Liberation Army with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao. From then on, he insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, determined to devote his life to the great cause of serving the people.

In 1962, his unit was stationed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The organization assigned him to make charcoal, which was very tiring work, but he never rested for a single day. Not only that, but the transportation conditions at the station were very inconvenient, and sometimes the food supply was not enough. He used every spare moment to cross mountains and brave the snow to fetch grain for the company from twenty miles away. Due to overwork, his stomach often acted up, sometimes even making him sweat profusely. But no one could stop him.

In 1963, the unit started farming on the plateau. The production tasks were heavy, and at the beginning, some comrades had a sense of difficulty. Luo Huatai voluntarily went to the squad leader and said, "To complete this reclamation task, the key is not the comrades' physical strength, but their ideology. As long as we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of every soldier, no matter how heavy the task is, it can definitely be completed. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests.' As long as the soldiers understand this, they will generate tremendous power in their work." During labor, he often organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and used his own actions to influence and inspire everyone. Once, while digging the ground, his hands were full of blisters. The medic told him to rest, but he refused. The political instructor urged him to go back and rest, but he still refused, saying, "A few blisters on the hands are nothing. Chairman Mao said: 'Work is struggle.' No matter how hard the stone is, it is not as hard as the soldiers' ideology. For the people's interests, I am not afraid of any difficulties." The class that Luo Huatai was in, under his influence, everyone was full of spirit, never complained, and never got tired. The original task set by the higher-ups was to reclaim three and a half mu per person per day, but their class averaged nine and three-tenths mu per person per day.

Extremely Responsible to the Revolution

In 1965, Luo Huatai was transferred to the 32111 drilling team. At first, everything was unfamiliar to him in the industrial sector, and he did not understand any of the equipment, so he had some fluctuations in his thoughts. Later, he brought his questions and repeatedly studied the three articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," finding the answers in Chairman Mao's works. He said, "Serving the people means not picking the light and avoiding the heavy. Revolutionaries on any post should fulfill their duties."

In his work, he always showed an extremely responsible revolutionary spirit. Last September, the team assigned their class to test the pressure of the cast iron plate used for testing, requiring it to be tested up to two hundred atmospheres. After the class accepted the task, the work started smoothly, but when the pressure rose to one hundred and eighty atmospheres, it became difficult to increase it further. Some comrades said, "Just forget it, it can withstand one hundred and eighty atmospheres, and it seems that two hundred atmospheres won't have any problems." Luo Huatai heard this and said seriously, "This won't do. No matter how much effort we have to put in, we must complete the task with quality and quantity guaranteed." He took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read to everyone, "In the world, the most feared are the words 'seriousness.' The Communist Party is the most serious about 'seriousness.' We must do as Chairman Mao said, do safe and reliable work for the Party and the people, and not be careless or make do." From then on, everyone voluntarily set strict requirements, used their brains to find ways, and finally tested up to two hundred atmospheres, completing the task with quality and quantity guaranteed.

In his work, he always took the lead, shouldering the heaviest burdens. Wherever it was the most difficult, he appeared there. Wherever it was the most dangerous, he fought there. Once, during the night shift, it happened to be raining heavily, and the mud pool had a lot of sediment. The driller decided to clean the mud pool. Luo Huatai, without waiting for the assignment, quickly took off his clothes and jumped into the mud pool. At that time, it was very cold, and soon he was shivering. The comrades wanted to go down and replace him, but he said, "Let me freeze, so that everyone else won't be affected by the cold and the work won't be affected." He continued to work until he finished cleaning the mud pool, but his feet were burned by the lye. He secretly washed the mud off his feet, put on his clothes, and continued to work as if nothing had happened.

He always thought of the revolution and never cared about personal gains or losses. He often endured pain and worked while sick. Soon after he joined the petroleum department, he participated in the construction of the communication line. When carrying the poles, others carried one pole with two people, but he carried one pole alone. However, when walking empty-handed, he held his stomach. Later, it was known that his stomach disease had relapsed. Some comrades asked him in concern, "Why didn't you say you were sick earlier? Working like this will ruin your health, what good will that do for the revolution?" He replied, "Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, and many other heroes, for the sake of rescuing state property and rescuing class brothers, sacrificed their precious lives. They were not afraid of death, so how could I lie down in front of this little sickness!"

Never Let a Revolutionary Comrade Fall Behind

Luo Huatai had deep class feelings for his revolutionary comrades and always treated others' difficulties as his own. He always put others' interests above his own. When he was in the army, two new soldiers were assigned to their class. Because they were new to the army, they were not used to everything, and their work was sometimes hot and sometimes cold. At that time, someone suggested, "Such soldiers assigned to the class will affect the class's honor." However, Luo Huatai, on the one hand, mobilized the whole class to do ideological work, and on the other hand, actively approached them and studied the articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" with them repeatedly. After help, these two comrades became good soldiers. They said to Luo Huatai, "Deputy squad leader, you and the comrades made us understand that on any post, we are doing revolution, and any work is for serving the people. In the future, we must do a good job." When Luo Huatai was transferred, these two soldiers held his hands and, with tears in their eyes, sent him all the way to the company.

After joining the 32111 team, he still maintained the fine traditions of the army, spreading Mao Zedong Thought wherever he went. He helped all ten comrades in the class. He said, "These comrades are all our class brothers. We must not let a single class brother fall behind."

Last winter, the organization decided that the driver's assistant Li Wenxuan would take on the driver's job. After the announcement, Li Wenxuan was in low spirits. Luo Huatai guessed that he might be afraid of taking on heavy responsibilities. One day, he took the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to find Li Wenxuan and studied together the words in "On the Chongqing Negotiations": "The burden is light or heavy. Some people pick the light and avoid the heavy, pushing the heavy burden to others and picking the light for themselves. This is not a good attitude. Some comrades are not like this. They let others enjoy first and take the heavy burden themselves. They eat bitterness in front of others and enjoy in the back. Such comrades are good comrades. We must all learn this communist spirit." This study and conversation had a great impact on Li Wenxuan. Later, he happily took on the driver's job and did it very well.

Facing Danger, Unflinching and Unafraid

Chairman Mao's instructions on finding gas and oil shook the entire mining area. Everyone, with unparalleled loyalty, carried out Chairman Mao's instructions. Luo Huatai was even more excited. He couldn't wait to drill out a large gas field with one drill bit. He promised the Party, "To find the gas field, I am determined to fight to the death, fearing no hardships or difficulties, and in any dangerous situation, I will remain calm and fearless. For the Party and the people's cause, I am willing to sacrifice everything."

On June 14th, the well he was working on, according to the geological forecast, needed to be careful of blowouts. The driller assigned Luo Huatai to observe the wellhead display and make good records. That day, the footage was fast, and indeed, a strong blowout occurred. At this moment, Luo Huatai bravely rushed up and used his body to protect the driller's safe operation.

At 00:00 on June 22nd, he and the collector Heng Sishu were on duty to observe the pressure changes. When he saw that the wellhead pressure had risen to one hundred and sixty-nine atmospheres, he was extremely happy. He said to Heng Sishu, "The pressure is so high and rising so fast, it must be a big 'gas tiger.' If we really catch this big 'gas tiger,' Chairman Mao will be so happy!" The pressure was rising, and Luo Huatai's heart was boiling. Like a sentry on the front line, he was fully focused, his eyes fixed on the pressure changes, and he recorded every small change in the pressure without missing a single detail.

Just as he had just recorded one hundred and seventy-nine atmospheres, something unexpected happened...

Comrade Luo Huatai's life was a life shining with the great light of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the sun and rain of Chairman Mao, a child from a poor peasant family was nurtured into a hero of our great era.

    把生命献给共产主义事业
    ——记舍身护井英雄罗华太同志
    “世界上最珍贵的是太阳，人最需要的是毛泽东思想。我们应该像雷锋、王杰一样，活学活用毛主席著作，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。”
    这是32111钻井队舍身护井的英雄罗华太，生前写下的一段日记。
    这位只有二十四岁的英雄，从参加革命的那天起，就如饥如渴地读毛主席的书，认真听毛主席的话，坚定不移地按照毛主席的指示办事。不论在任何岗位上，都是最大限度地发挥着自己的作用。
    罗华太的祖父和父亲都给地主当长工、卖劳力维持生活。解放后，他一入小学读书，就牢牢地记住了两句话：“翻身不忘共产党，永远跟着毛主席”。
            工作就是斗争
    一九六○年，罗华太怀着对党和毛主席的无限热爱参加了中国人民解放军。从那以后，他就一直坚持活学活用毛主席著作，下定决心把自己的生命贡献给为人民服务的伟大事业。
    一九六二年，他所在的部队在康藏高原上执勤。组织上决定他烧木炭，这个工作很累，他却从没有休息过一天。不但如此，当时部队驻地交通很不方便，有时粮食供应不上。他还利用一切空隙，翻山越岭，冒着风雪，到二十里外为连队背粮食。由于过度疲劳，他的胃病经常发作，有时甚至痛得直冒汗。但是谁也劝阻不住他。
    一九六三年，部队在高原上开荒种地。生产任务重，开始时有些同志有畏难情绪。罗华太主动找班长说：“要完成这次开荒任务，关键不在于同志的体力，而在于思想。只要充分发挥每个战士的积极性，任务再重，也一定能够完成。毛主席教导我们：‘我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。’只要战士们懂得了这一点，就会在工作中产生巨大的威力。”他在劳动过程中经常组织大家学习毛主席著作，并用自己的实际行动，去影响和带动大家。一次挖地时，他的双手打满了血泡，卫生员叫他休息，他不肯，指导员动员他回去休息，他也不肯，他说：“手上打几个泡泡算得了什么，毛主席说：‘工作就是斗争。’石头再坚硬，也没有人民战士思想硬，为了人民的利益，什么困难我也不怕。”罗华太所在的那个班，在他的带动下，同志们个个意气风发，从不叫苦，从不叫累，本来上级规定的任务是每人每天开荒三分五厘，而他们班里平均每人每天开了九分三厘。
            对革命极端负责
    一九六五年罗华太转业到32111钻井队。初到工业部门，一切都很陌生，什么设备都不懂，因此在他思想上曾经产生过波动。后来他带着问题，反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》三篇文章，从毛主席著作中找到了答案，他说：“为人民服务就不能拈轻怕重，革命者在任何岗位上，都应该尽到自己的责任。”
    他在工作中处处表现出极端负责的革命精神。去年九月，队上布置他们班给测试用的生铁板试压，要求试到二百个大气压。班里接受任务后，开始工作还比较顺利，可是当压力上升到一百八十个大气压时，再往上压就困难了。有个别同志说：“干脆算了，它能承受一百八十个大气压，看来二百个大气压也不会有什么问题。”罗华太听了，严肃地说：“这不行，那怕我们付出再大的力气，也要保质保量完成任务。”他拿出《毛主席语录》给大家读道：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”他说：“我们要按毛主席说的办，要给党给人民干保险活，不能马虎凑合。”从这以后，大家自觉地提出严格要求，动脑筋想办法，终于试到二百个大气压，保质保量地完成了任务。
    他在工作中一向处处走在前头，争挑重担子。那里最困难，他就出现在那里，那里最危险，他就在那里斗争。有一次上夜班，正赶上泥浆池沉淀物很多，司钻决定清洗泥浆池。罗华太没等分配任务，就赶快脱去衣服跳进泥浆池。当时正下着大雨，天气很冷，一会就冻得发抖。同志们要下去换他，他说：“要冻就冻我一个，免得大家都受冻影响工作。”他一直干到把泥浆池洗完，而自己双脚的皮肤却被烧碱烧烂了。他为了不使别人发现，偷偷地洗去脚上的泥浆，然后穿上衣服，若无其事地又继续工作。
    他一心想着革命，从不计较个人的得失，经常忍受痛苦，带病工作。他刚到石油部门就参加通讯线路的架设工作。在扛电线杆时，别人两人抬一根，他一人扛一根。可是空手走路时，他却抱着肚子，后来才知道他的胃病复发了。有的同志关心地问他说：“你有病为啥不早点说，这样硬干把身体弄坏了对革命有什么好处？”他回答说：“王杰、欧阳海等许许多多英雄人物，他们为了抢救国家财产，为了抢救阶级兄弟，献出了自己宝贵的生命。他们死都不怕，我还能在这点小病前躺下吗！”同志们被他这种一心为革命的崇高精神深深感动。
          决不让一个革命同志掉队
    罗华太对待革命同志有着深厚的阶级感情，从来都把别人的困难，当作自己的困难，把别人的利益看得比自己的利益还重。还在部队时，有两名新战士编到他们班上。因为他们初到部队，各方面都不习惯，工作忽冷忽热。当时有人提出：“这样的战士分到班上会影响全班的荣誉。”但是罗华太一方面发动全班同志作思想工作，一方面主动和他们接近，和他们一起反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。经过帮助，这两位同志都成了很好的战士。他们对罗华太说：“副班长，你和同志们使我们懂得了在任何岗位上都是干革命，作任何工作都是为人民服务。今后我们一定要搞好工作。”罗华太转业时，这两位战士拉着他的双手，流着眼泪，一直把他送到营部。
    到32111队以后，他依然保持着部队的优良传统，走到那里，就把毛泽东思想宣传到那里。他对班里十个同志，都进行过帮助。他说：“这些同志都是我们的阶级弟兄。我们决不能让一个阶级弟兄掉队。”
    去年冬天，组织上决定司机助手李文轩担任司机工作。宣布以后，李文轩闷闷不乐。罗华太估计他可能是怕挑重担子。一天，他拿着《毛主席语录》去找李文轩，共同学习《关于重庆谈判》中的一段话：“担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”这次学习和谈话，对李文轩教育很大。后来他愉快地担任了司机工作，并且工作做的很好。
        紧急关头，脸不变色，心不跳
    毛主席关于找气找油的指示，震动整个矿区。每一个人都以无比忠诚的实际行动，执行着毛主席的指示。罗华太更是控制不住内心的激动。他恨不得一个钻头砸出一个大气田来。他向党保证：“为了找出气田，我决心拚死拚活冲上去，任何艰难困苦都不怕，在任何危急关头，一定做到脸不变色，心不跳，为了党和人民的事业，牺牲个人的一切都心甘情愿。”
    六月十四日，他工作的那口气井，根据地质预告要注意防喷。司钻分配罗华太观察井口显示，作好记录。这天进尺很快，果真发生了强烈的井喷。这时，罗华太勇敢地冲上去，用自己的身体保护着司钻安全操作。
    六月二十二日零时正，是他和采集员衡思树负责看压力变化情况。当他看到井口的气压已上升到一百六十九时，他真高兴极了。他对衡思树说：“压力这么大，又上升得这样快，一定是个大‘气老虎’。若真抓到这个大‘气老虎’，毛主席他老人家该是多么高兴啊！”压力在上升，罗华太的心在沸腾。他像站在阵地前沿的哨兵一样，全神贯注，两眼死死地盯住压力变化，把压力的每一个细小变化，都一点不漏地记录下来。
    就在他刚刚记下一百七十九个大气压时，意外的事情发生了……。
    罗华太同志的一生，是闪耀着伟大毛泽东思想光辉的一生。在毛主席的阳光雨露下，把一个贫农出身的孩子哺育成为我们伟大时代的英雄。
