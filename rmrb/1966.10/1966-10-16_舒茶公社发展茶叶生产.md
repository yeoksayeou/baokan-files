Shucha Commune in Anhui Province, known for its tea production, is actively developing its tea industry under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teachings. The hills that were previously uncultivated have now been transformed into terraced fields, becoming new-style tea gardens. The rows of tea plants are growing lush and strong. This year, the commune's tea production has increased more than fourfold compared to pre-liberation levels and has doubled since Chairman Mao's inspection in 1958. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    舒茶公社发展茶叶生产
    盛产茶叶的安徽省舒城县舒茶公社，按照毛主席的教导，积极发展茶叶生产。这个公社过去没有开垦过的山坡，现在已修筑成一层层梯田，开辟成新式茶园，纵横成行的茶棵，生长得青翠茁壮。今年全社茶叶产量比解放前增加四倍多，比毛主席来这里视察的一九五八年增加了一倍。　（据新华社讯）
