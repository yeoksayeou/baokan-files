	Mao Zedong Thought Shines Brightly, Good News Comes from All Directions
	Over 700,000 People in the Capital Visit the Party Central and State Council Reception Stations to Celebrate

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, "Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, good news comes from all directions, the red nuclear missile has succeeded, and the revolutionary people are smiling." In the capital Beijing, over the past three days, more than 700,000 revolutionary masses, with hearts full of excitement, have visited the reception stations of the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council to deliver good news, congratulatory letters, and resolutions. They enthusiastically celebrate the success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch, and the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

	People have expressed on countless congratulatory letters, congratulatory messages, and resolutions: Great Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon. We must truly master Mao Zedong Thought and let the great Mao Zedong Thought guide us to create one miracle after another and lead us to one victory after another.

	Over the past three days, the capital has been immersed in unprecedented joy. Tens of thousands of workers from the capital, commune members from the suburbs, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, scientific and technological workers, as well as revolutionary students and Red Guards from the capital and from all over the country, braved the cold wind, carrying large red congratulatory messages, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beating drums and gongs, surging from every street and alley in the city towards the location of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Over the past three days, the reception stations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council have been crowded with people, with red flags flying, and teams delivering good news coming one after another. People have sung "The Ship of State Needs a Helmsman" and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" countless times.

	Many workers, without even changing out of their work clothes, rushed to deliver good news as soon as they got off work. Some far-flung communes also sent representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to deliver congratulatory letters and resolutions by night train. The broad masses of workers and peasants who came to deliver good news pointed out that this great achievement is due to Mao Zedong Thought above all else. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force and exert an invincible power. The broad masses of workers and peasants have expressed their determination to learn from the soldiers, scientific and technological personnel, and workers who participated in the test, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to create miracles with Mao Zedong Thought. They will seize the revolution and promote production in the current high tide of the Cultural Revolution, striving for victory in both revolution and production.

	Revolutionary students and Red Guards from the capital and from all over the country have gathered like a thousand rivers flowing into the sea, from all corners of the capital to the reception stations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They sang, danced, and rejoiced. Many students from outside the capital heard the good news on the train to Beijing and formed teams to come and celebrate as soon as they got off. In their resolutions, they wrote, "Thousands of victories, tens of thousands of victories, all victories belong to the great Mao Zedong Thought, all victories belong to the great leader Chairman Mao." Revolutionary students and Red Guards have expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, to uphold Mao Zedong Thought extensively, to resolutely defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, scientific and technological workers, revolutionary students, and Red Guards have pointed out in their celebrations that the success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test launch has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and has greatly dampened the spirits of imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have mastered missile and nuclear weapons, which is a significant contribution to opposing the aggression of American imperialism and safeguarding world peace.

    首都七十多万人连日到党中央和国务院群众接待站欢呼报喜
    据新华社三十日讯　“毛泽东思想放光彩，万里东风捷报来，红色核导弹成了功，革命人民笑颜开。”在首都北京，三天来有七十多万革命群众，怀着无比兴奋的心情，到中共中央和国务院群众接待站送喜报、贺信和决心书，热烈欢呼我国发射导弹核武器试验成功，欢呼毛泽东思想新的伟大胜利。
    人们在数不清的喜报、贺信和决心书上表示：伟大的毛泽东思想是最强大的武器，我们一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，让伟大的毛泽东思想指导我们创造一个又一个奇迹，引导我们走向一个又一个胜利。
    三天来，首都一直浸沉在无比欢乐之中。成千上万的首都工人、郊区公社社员、解放军指战员、革命干部、科学技术工作者，以及首都和来自全国各地的革命师生、红卫兵小将们，冒着寒风，抬着大红喜报，高举毛主席画像和《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，从全市大街小巷向党中央和国务院所在地涌来。三天来，党中央和国务院群众接待站前，人如潮涌，红旗翻飞，报喜队络绎不绝。人们千遍万遍同声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，千遍万遍同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”
    许多工人刚下班连工作服都顾不上脱就赶来报喜。一些远郊区的农村人民公社，也选派贫下中农代表连夜乘火车送来贺信和决心书。前来报喜的广大工农群众指出，这一巨大成就的取得，千条万条，毛泽东思想第一条。毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量，发挥无比强大的威力。广大工农群众纷纷表示，要向参加试验的解放军指战员、科学技术人员和职工们学习，像他们那样活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来创造奇迹。要在当前无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，抓革命，促生产，夺取革命和生产双胜利。
    首都和来自全国各地的广大革命师生和红卫兵小将，这几天像千河万流归大海一样，从首都各处汇集到党中央和国务院群众接待站来。他们唱呀，跳呀，欢喜若狂。许多外地革命师生在来北京的火车上听到喜讯，下车后就结队前来贺喜。他们在一份份的决心书上说，千胜利，万胜利，胜利归于伟大的毛泽东思想，胜利归于伟大的领袖毛主席。广大革命师生和红卫兵们纷纷表示，一定要在无产阶级文化大革命中，大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，坚决捍卫和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广大工农兵、革命干部、科学技术工作者、革命师生和红卫兵在报喜中指出，我国发射导弹核武器试验成功，大大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的威风。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民掌握了导弹核武器，对于反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平是一个重大贡献。
