We have seen many performances, but the "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Sing Praises to Chairman Mao" evening show is the most unforgettable. Such a performance by workers, peasants, and soldiers singing praises to our great leader Chairman Mao is something we poor and lower-middle peasants have longed to see for a very long time. This wish has finally been realized in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This performance truly expresses our love for Chairman Mao! We poor and lower-middle peasants love to watch such programs the most!

We poor and lower-middle peasants have boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. We all regard Chairman Mao's books as our guiding principles. After studying Chairman Mao's works, our political consciousness has been continuously raised, and many heroes and countless good deeds have emerged in the countryside. We hope that artistic performances will reflect these inspiring deeds and our boundless love for Chairman Mao's works. However, in the past, under the control of Zhou Yang's revisionist literary line, the stage was full of feudal and bourgeois art, none of which served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and all of which opposed the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. This joint performance by workers, peasants, and soldiers can be said to be a powerful blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang and others.

Every song and every performance in the program greatly inspired us. The performance by the garrison troops in Beijing made us see that the revolutionary army personally created by Chairman Mao is indeed a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We poor and lower-middle peasants must learn from the People's Liberation Army and make every brigade and production team in our commune a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire country. From the performance, we were very happy to see the workers and their families from Daqing Oil Field studying Chairman Mao's works earnestly, following the Party's instructions, and always maintaining a revolutionary spirit. Their fearless, revolutionary spirit has given us a vivid political lesson. Especially when they, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, overcame numerous difficulties and finally conquered the oil field, we were indescribably happy, clapping our hands vigorously, and feeling warm in our hearts. Truly, the hearts of the audience and the performers were connected!

We poor and lower-middle peasants love to read Chairman Mao's books the most and love to listen to Chairman Mao's words. We will resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The amateur performance team from Hebei Province sang praises to Chairman Mao, and every word and sentence was from the heart, touching our hearts deeply. Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts, Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and Mao Zedong Thought is our compass. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The commune peasants should take agriculture as their main focus (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries), and also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. When conditions permit, they should also set up small factories collectively and criticize the bourgeoisie." We poor and lower-middle peasants will resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

The performance by the Hebei Province amateur performance team, "The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Love Chairman Mao the Most," truly reflects the touching scene of us poor and lower-middle peasants loving Chairman Mao and loving Chairman Mao's works. All our community members cannot do without Chairman Mao's works. We bring the little red book to the fields and study during our rest time. The more we study, the brighter our hearts become. We will study Chairman Mao's books for life and serve the people for life! This is our lifelong aspiration!

After watching the performance, our revolutionary enthusiasm is even higher, and our confidence is even stronger. We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the socialist revolutionary cause through to the end!

    我们的愿望实现了
    北京市海淀区东升公社　傅玉德　赵秀玲
    “工农兵歌颂毛主席”晚会，是我们看过的演出中最难忘的一场演出。像这样的工农兵歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的文艺节目，我们贫下中农很早很早就想看到。这个愿望终于在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中实现了。这次演出可把我们热爱毛主席的心情表达出来了！我们贫下中农最喜欢看这样的节目！
    我们贫下中农对最最敬爱的领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。我们都把毛主席的书当作指导方针。学习了毛主席著作以后，我们的政治觉悟不断提高，在农村出现了许多英雄人物和说不完的好人好事。我们希望文艺演出要反映这些激动人心的事迹和我们对毛主席著作的无比热爱。可是，以前在周扬修正主义文艺路线的控制下，舞台上尽是些封建文艺和资产阶级文艺，都不是为我们工农兵服务的，都是反对宣传毛泽东思想的。这次工农兵的联合演出，可以说是对反革命修正主义分子周扬等人的有力打击。
    节目中的每一首歌，每一个表演，都使我们受到了很大的鼓舞。驻京部队战士的演出，使我们看到了毛主席亲手缔造的革命化的军队，确实是一个毛泽东思想的大学校。我们贫下中农就是要向解放军学习，也要让我们公社的每一个大队、生产队都成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    毛泽东思想光芒万丈，照亮了祖国的四面八方。从演出中，我们非常高兴地看到大庆油田的工人和家属们，认真学习毛主席著作，听党的话，永远闹革命的冲天干劲。他们这种天不怕，地不怕，敢于革命的精神，给我们上了一堂生动的政治课。特别是他们以毛泽东思想为指南，克服了重重困难，最后终于拿下了大油田的时候，我们的心里有说不出来的高兴，双手用劲地鼓掌，心里热呼呼的，真是观众的心与演员的心连结在一起了！
    我们贫下中农最爱读毛主席的书，最爱听毛主席的话，坚决照毛主席的指示办事。河北省农民业余演出队对毛主席的赞颂，字字句句是真情，处处说在我们的心坎上。毛主席就是我们心中最红最红的太阳，毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子，毛泽东思想是我们的方向盘。毛主席教导我们说：“公社农民以农为主（包括林、牧、副、渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化。在有条件的时候，也要由集体办些小工厂，也要批判资产阶级。”我们贫下中农坚决按毛主席指示去办。
    河北省农民业余演出队表演的《贫下中农最爱毛主席》，真实地反映了我们贫下中农热爱毛主席，热爱毛主席著作的动人情景。我们广大社员人人离不开毛主席著作。我们把语录牌带到了田间、地头，利用休息的时间进行学习。我们贫下中农越学心里越亮堂，我们要学一辈子毛主席的书，为人民服务一辈子！这就是我们贫下中农的终生的志愿！
    看完演出以后，我们的革命干劲更高了，信心更强了。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义革命事业进行到底！（附图片）
