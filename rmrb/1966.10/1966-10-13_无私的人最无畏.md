Title: The Selfless Are the Most Fearless
Author: Gong Guangbo
Date: 1966-10-13
Edition: 3

The heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team, like our old platoon leader, special-grade merit citizen, and special-grade combat hero Huang Jiguang, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, are infinitely loyal to the people, and love the motherland infinitely. They think of the seven hundred million people, and have no thought of themselves. The selfless are the most fearless. Huang Jiguang, for the sake of the motherland, for the people, for the revolution, bravely used his body to block the enemy's machine gun nest, sacrificing his precious life to win the battle and establish an immortal merit for the revolution. Today, the 32111 Team is a collective Huang Jiguang. They, like Huang Jiguang, are loyal and brave, protecting the state's property, and adding new luster to our era. We learn from the heroes, and we must learn from them to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to turn Mao Zedong Thought into our soul, and to regard revolutionary interests as our first life. If we can do this, we can be invincible.

    无私的人最无畏
    三二一一一英雄钻井队的英雄们，和我们的老班长、特等功臣、特级战斗英雄黄继光同志一样，最听毛主席的话，对人民无限忠诚，对祖国无限热爱，心里想着七亿人民，唯独没有个人。无私的人最无畏。黄继光同志为了祖国、为了人民、为了革命，英勇地用身体堵住了敌人的机枪眼，献出宝贵的生命，换取了战斗的胜利，为革命立下了不朽的功勋。今天，三二一一一队，就是集体的黄继光。他们同黄继光一样，赤胆忠心，保卫国家的财产，给我们的时代增添了新的光采。我们学英雄，就是要学他们听毛主席的话，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把革命利益当作第一生命。做到这一点，我们就可以所向无敌。
