	Send the Badges to Them

	Editor,

	I read in the People's Daily an article expressing the feelings of the PLA soldiers stationed on the border of Tibet. I was deeply moved. Their eagerness to obtain Chairman Mao's portrait badge reflects the boundless love and admiration of the 700 million revolutionary people of China and all revolutionary people around the world for Chairman Mao. When I read that letter, I thought, we should let our border guards wear Chairman Mao's portrait badge, for they stand on the frontline defending our motherland and are Chairman Mao's most loyal soldiers. If I had a Chairman Mao portrait badge, I would definitely give it to the border guards first. What a coincidence, today I received a Chairman Mao portrait badge. I was so excited! At this moment, I thought of the border guards, and I decided to send this badge to them. Please help me forward it. Before sending it to them, I wore this shining badge on my chest for three hours, feeling infinite happiness and warmth.

	Editor, please quickly forward this badge to the border guards. Hurry, hurry! Let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminate the hearts of the border guards, and let Mao Zedong Thought bind the hearts of revolutionary people on different posts together like a red thread.

	Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!

    把纪念章送给他们编辑同志：
    我从《人民日报》上看到表达驻守西藏边疆的解放军战士心情的信，非常感动。他们那种迫切希望得到毛主席像纪念章的心情，代表了我国七亿革命人民和全世界革命人民对毛主席的无比热爱和敬仰。看到那封信时，我想，应该让我们的边防战士戴上毛主席像纪念章，因为他们站在保卫祖国的最前线，是毛主席最忠实的战士。如果我有毛主席像纪念章，我一定先送给边防战士。真巧，今天我得到了一枚毛主席像纪念章，我是多么兴奋呀！就在这个时候，我想起边防战士，我决定把这枚纪念章送给他们，请你们代转一下。在送给他们之前，我让这枚金光闪闪的纪念章在我胸前戴了三个小时，心里感到无限的幸福和温暖。
    编辑同志，请赶快把这枚纪念章转给边防战士，快，快！让毛泽东思想的光辉永远照亮边防战士的心坎，让毛泽东思想把我们各个不同岗位上革命人民的心像红线一样联结起来。
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
