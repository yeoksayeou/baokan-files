Hundreds of millions of urban and rural people across the country, with deep class feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have immediately begun studying and widely propagating Comrade Lin Biao's call to the People's Liberation Army to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They are determined to swiftly implement this call in action.

In the past few days, in all 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, activities to study, discuss, and propagate Comrade Lin Biao's instructions have been launched everywhere. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres have all pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao's call, issued in the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is extremely important and timely for the whole Party and the people of the whole country. It points out the direction for our advance. The workers of the Daqing Oil Field excitedly pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao's call has struck a chord with the people of Daqing. Every victory of Daqing is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We must further master Mao Zedong Thought. At the First Automobile Works in Changchun, Jilin Province, 30,000 workers and their family members held a rally to pledge their response to Comrade Lin Biao's call. They decided to take the People's Liberation Army and the heroic 32111 drilling team as their examples and advance the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the entire factory to a new stage. In the suburbs of Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, at the Gu Mountain Commune, a meeting to propagate Chairman Mao's works was held with 4,000 participants from each production brigade. Everyone expressed their determination to achieve new levels of study and further advance the revolutionization of their thoughts, turning the people's commune into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. In Kunming City, Yunnan Province, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Kunming Department Store, the heroine Xu Xuehui, propagated Comrade Lin Biao's call in the broadcasting room to tens of thousands of customers. She said: Comrade Lin Biao, through leading the People's Liberation Army to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, has led the people of the whole country onto the great path of studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Today, his great call reflects the wishes of hundreds of millions of people across the country and is the most timely and powerful encouragement for the people of the whole country.

In the process of studying and discussing, people across the country unanimously emphasized that to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, the fundamental issue is to constantly raise revolutionary consciousness, establish a proletarian worldview, and fully recognize the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought. With the strongest class feelings, we must study Chairman Mao's works. Many workers in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, at a meeting, enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought as the root of revolution, the ocean of wisdom, the source of strength, the guide to action, the weapon of struggle, the guarantee of victory, and the eternal red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people. They expressed their determination to more consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Many workers in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, pointed out in discussions that we must never forget that there are still sharp class struggles within the country and that imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries still exist in the world. We bear the great historical mission of carrying the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end. To accomplish this mission, we must arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and use it to unify the thoughts of all ethnic groups in the country. Li Quanxu, the secretary of the party branch of Nanhuanglonggou Brigade, Beizhuang Commune, Pingshan County, Hebei Province, said, "The core of Mao Zedong Thought is class struggle. Only with proletarian feelings can we see class struggle, grasp class struggle, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought." In Tibet and Yunnan, many ethnic minority peasants who have stood up expressed with deep class feelings that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the hearts of the ethnic minority people and warmed their bodies. We must forever study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad revolutionary masses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and other provinces and autonomous regions have all expressed their determination to follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, combine them with actual conditions, link them with thoughts, link them with work, especially link them with the actual class struggle, and study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Only in this way can we truly master Mao Zedong Thought. The activists of studying Chairman Mao's works in Fangxiang Brigade, Jiangsu Province, discussed at a meeting that studying without applying is like farming without sowing seeds, a waste of effort. People pointed out that only by combining with actual conditions can we understand, remember, and apply what we learn. Many places have voluntarily compared themselves with the People's Liberation Army, feeling that the biggest gap is the word "apply." The activists participating in the report meeting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works held by the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee discussed that Comrade Lin Biao has set higher requirements for us. To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, we must, like the People's Liberation Army, work hard on combining with actual conditions.

The broad revolutionary masses and cadres also expressed their determination to firmly implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, take "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" as their guiding principles, study them repeatedly, apply what they learn, and advance the revolutionization of their thoughts. Some workers in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, talked about how only by studying these three articles can we truly establish a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people, serve the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly like Norman Bethune and Zhang Side, overcome all difficulties like the foolish old man, and strive for new victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards who have taken the lead in various places have all expressed their determination to also take the lead in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The Red Guards in cities such as Jinan, Kunming, Guiyang, and Xining have issued initiatives, held meetings and discussions, and made study plans, enthusiastically responding to and implementing Comrade Lin Biao's call. The young Red Guards have proposed to thoroughly and unconditionally implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions. Currently, we must especially pay attention to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the problems of the Cultural Revolution. We must firmly defend the proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and strive to complete the tasks of one struggle, two lines, and three transformations.

The brave soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army Air Force guarding the front lines in Fujian have most resolutely responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, determined to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They must study Chairman Mao's works more tightly, combine them with actual conditions, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

    据新华社十二日讯　全国各地亿万城乡人民，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，立即学习和广泛宣传林彪同志号召人民解放军把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的号召，决心把这个号召最迅速地贯彻到行动中去。
    这几天，在全国二十八个省、市和自治区，到处都展开了学习、讨论和宣传林彪同志指示的活动。广大工农兵群众、革命知识分子和革命干部纷纷指出，林彪同志在无产阶级文化大革命新高潮中发出的这一号召，对全党和全国人民都非常重要、非常及时，它给人们指出了前进的方向。大庆油田广大职工兴奋地指出，林彪同志的号召说到了我们大庆人的心坎上。我们大庆的每一个胜利都是毛泽东思想的胜利，我们一定要把毛泽东思想进一步学到手。在吉林省的长春第一汽车制造厂，有三万名职工和职工家属举行誓师大会，坚决响应林彪同志的号召，决心以解放军和英雄的32111钻井队为榜样，把全厂活学活用毛主席著作的运动推向新阶段。在福建省福州市郊的鼓山公社，以大队为单位举行了有四千人参加的毛主席著作讲用会，大家表示一定要学出新的水平，进一步搞好思想革命化，把人民公社办成毛泽东思想的大学校。在云南省，昆明市百货大楼团总支书记、女英雄徐学惠在广播室里向成千上万的顾客宣传了林彪同志的号召。她说：林彪同志通过领导解放军活学活用毛主席著作，把全国人民带上了学习和掌握毛泽东思想的大道。今天他发出的伟大号召，反映了全国亿万人民的心愿，对全国人民是最及时、最巨大的鼓舞力量。
    各地人民在学习和讨论中一致强调，要把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段，最根本的问题是要不断提高革命的自觉性，树立无产阶级世界观，充分认识毛泽东思想的伟大意义，带着最强烈的阶级感情学习毛主席著作。黑龙江省哈尔滨市的许多职工，在座谈会上热情赞颂毛泽东思想是革命的根本，是智慧的海洋，是力量的源泉，是行动的指南，是斗争的武器，是胜利的保证，是革命人民心中永远不落的红太阳。他们表示一定要更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。内蒙古自治区呼和浩特市的许多工人在讨论中指出，我们千万不能忘记，国内还存在着尖锐的阶级斗争，世界上还存在着帝国主义、修正主义和反动派，我们肩负着把中国革命和世界革命进行到底的伟大历史使命。要完成这个使命，就必须用战无不胜的毛泽东思想把我们武装起来，用它来统一全国各族人民的思想。河北省平山县宅北公社南滚龙沟大队党支部书记李全寿说，毛泽东思想的核心是阶级斗争。有了无产阶级感情，才能看到阶级斗争，抓住阶级斗争，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。在西藏和云南等地区，许多少数民族翻身农民怀着极其深厚的阶级感情说，毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了我们少数民族人民的心，温暖了少数民族人民的身，我们一定要永远学习、贯彻、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想。
    江苏、浙江、湖南、广西、新疆、宁夏等省和自治区的广大革命群众，都表示要按照林彪同志的指示，结合实际，联系思想，联系工作，特别联系阶级斗争的实际，活学活用毛主席著作，这样才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。江苏省方巷大队的学习毛主席著作积极分子们在座谈会上谈到，学了不用，等于种田不撒种，白费一场工。人们指出，只有结合实际，才能学得懂，记得住，用得上。许多地方自动地同解放军找差距，大家感到最大的差距就是一个“用”字。正在参加中共山西省委举办的毛主席著作学用报告会的学习积极分子们谈到，林彪同志向我们提出了更高的要求，要把毛泽东思想真正掌握起来，就必须像解放军那样，在联系实际上下硬功夫。
    广大革命群众和革命干部还表示要坚决执行林彪同志的指示，把《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》作为座右铭来学，反复地学，学了就用，搞好思想革命化。甘肃省兰州市有的职工谈到，只有学好这三篇文章，才能真正树立起完全彻底为人民服务的世界观，才能像白求恩、张思德那样全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务，才能像老愚公那样去战胜一切困难，争取社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的新胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中充当急先锋的各地红卫兵，纷纷表示在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中也要充当急先锋。济南、昆明、贵阳、西宁等城市的红卫兵，有的发出倡议，有的集会座谈，有的订出学习规划，热烈响应贯彻林彪同志的号召。红卫兵小将们提出，要彻底地不折不扣地执行林彪同志的指示，当前要特别注意带着文化大革命中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作。坚决捍卫无产阶级的革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级的反动路线，努力完成一斗、二批、三改的任务。（附图片）
    英勇守卫在福建前线的人民解放军空军部队干部、战士，最坚决地响应林彪同志的号召，决心把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，对毛主席著作的学习，要抓得更紧，要结合实际学，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。这是出席福建前线空军部队学习毛主席著作积极分子大会的丰福生同志（右二）和代表们在一起学习林彪同志的号召。
