	Editor's Note: The songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations published in our newspaper on September 30 and October 12 have been enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards. In the countryside and border areas, cities and villages, factories and fields, barracks and schools across the country, the songs praising Chairman Mao's quotations are being sung everywhere. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the Red Guards, say, "We love to sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations the most. When we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, we think of Chairman Mao. When we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, we think of Chairman Mao's teachings. When we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, we feel that Chairman Mao is by our side. The more we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, the more our hearts burn with revolutionary spirit and our fighting spirit soars."

	Comrade Lin Biao said, "To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must repeatedly study Chairman Mao's fundamental views, repeatedly study and repeatedly apply them. The most profound words in Chairman Mao's works should be memorized." Recently, Comrade Lin Biao emphasized again: "The 'Old Three Articles' should not only be studied by soldiers but also by cadres. The 'Old Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them. We should study the 'Old Three Articles' as a motto. Everyone at every level should study them. Once studied, they should be applied to promote ideological revolutionization."

	Currently, the people of the entire country and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are enthusiastically responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call, launching a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and studying the 'Old Three Articles' as a motto. To accompany the study of the 'Old Three Articles,' the editorial department of the *Liberation Army Daily* and the editorial department of *Liberation Army Songs* organized military musicians to compose songs based on the important quotations from the 'Old Three Articles.' The nine songs published in our newspaper today include the first song, which is Comrade Lin Biao's recent directive on studying the 'Old Three Articles,' composed by Comrade Jiefu, and the remaining eight songs, which are quotations from Chairman Mao set to music, all reprinted from the *Liberation Army Daily*.

	The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and Red Guard revolutionaries, we will forever sing the 'Old Three Articles,' singing to revolutionize our thoughts. We will forever study the 'Old Three Articles,' studying them seriously and applying them in practice, studying until our hearts are red and bright, forever following Chairman Mao in revolution.

    把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学
    编者按：本报九月三十日和十月十二日发表的为毛主席语录谱写的歌曲，受到了广大工农兵群众和红卫兵革命小将们最热烈的欢迎。在全国的内地和边疆，城市和乡村，工厂和田间，军营和学校，到处响起了高唱毛主席语录的歌声。广大工农兵群众和红卫兵说，我们最爱唱毛主席语录歌。唱起毛主席语录歌，就想起毛主席。唱起毛主席语录歌，就想起毛主席的教导。唱起毛主席语录歌，就更觉得毛主席在我们身边。越唱毛主席语录歌，就越是心红眼亮，斗志昂扬。
    林彪同志说，为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，反复学习，反复运用，毛主席著作中最精辟的话要能背下来。最近，林彪同志又强调指出：“老三篇”不但战士要学，干部也要学。“老三篇”最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。
    现在，全国人民和解放军指战员，热烈响应林彪同志号召，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新热潮，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。为了配合“老三篇”的学习，《解放军报》编辑部和《解放军歌曲》编辑部，组织部队的音乐工作者为“老三篇”的重要语录谱写了歌曲。本报今天发表的九首歌曲，第一首是林彪同志最近关于学习“老三篇”的指示，由劫夫同志谱曲，其余八首为毛主席语录谱的曲子，都转载自《解放军报》。
    广大的工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子和红卫兵革命小将，我们要永远歌唱“老三篇”，唱得思想革命化，我们要永远学习“老三篇”，认真学，切实用，学得心里红通通，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
