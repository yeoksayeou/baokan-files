More than a thousand overseas Chinese who suffered brutal persecution at the hands of right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia have returned to their motherland aboard the Guanghua. From the moment they boarded the repatriation ship on October 3rd, throughout the seven-day voyage, they have expressed their boundless love for the great socialist motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao at every moment.

These persecuted overseas Chinese were all victims of arson, looting, beatings, and humiliation by right-wing thugs in the Aceh region of Sumatra, Indonesia. They were then forcibly interned in Medan by the Indonesian government. Some were injured, others were tortured into serious illness, and they lived in extremely poor conditions in the refugee camp for persecuted overseas Chinese. Their days were truly miserable. When the news came that the Guanghua was setting sail on September 14th to bring them back to their motherland, they rejoiced and shouted, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has sent a ship to bring us back!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

In the afternoon of October 3rd, the persecuted overseas Chinese boarded the Guanghua. Before this, eight overseas Chinese had already been tortured to death in the refugee camp, and some were critically ill. Many were emaciated and weak. Some had to be carried onto the ship on stretchers by the crew. Upon boarding, they saw their compatriots from the motherland and looked back at the heavily guarded harbor, moved to tears, they exclaimed, "Two worlds, one on the ship and one on the dock! We've entered a new world!" Many overseas Chinese, upon boarding, rushed to the deck, tears streaming down their faces, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the motherland!" Many of them tightly grasped the hands of the crew, saying, "You are sent by Chairman Mao, you are closer to us than our own family!"

As soon as the persecuted overseas Chinese set foot on the motherland's ship, they demonstrated their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. An elderly overseas Chinese immediately asked the crew where they could find Chairman Mao's books. Some, seeing Chairman Mao's photo of him receiving millions of people at Tiananmen, were overjoyed and looked at it repeatedly. On October 4th, as the Guanghua sailed through the Malacca Strait, the Chinese government's repatriation team aboard the ship, on behalf of the people of the motherland, expressed heartfelt greetings to the returning persecuted overseas Chinese and presented them with copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Many persecuted overseas Chinese, upon receiving the long-awaited revolutionary treasure, were so moved that they wept, and despite feeling seasick, they immediately began to study it eagerly. Some elderly people, unable to see clearly, borrowed magnifying glasses to read Chairman Mao's books. Some elderly people who were illiterate asked young people to explain to them, and some elderly people stayed up late at night to read Chairman Mao's works carefully to help their companions understand. The persecuted overseas Chinese youth were particularly active, often gathering to read Chairman Mao's works and sing revolutionary songs. For several days at sea, the songs "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed across the waves. Many young people, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," understood that they should actively help others and care for others, and many good deeds of helping the elderly and caring for the sick emerged. Some elderly people happily said, "Our children have changed so quickly in just a few days on the ship!" The young people joyfully said, "Chairman Mao is the leader of the world's revolutionary people, the great motherland is the pillar of world revolution, the center of world revolution, and the place that the world's revolutionary people yearn for. We are proud to be Chinese! After returning to the motherland, we must listen to Chairman Mao even more and learn from the Red Guards to become a new generation of people in New China, actively participating in the revolution and construction of the motherland."

The persecuted overseas Chinese also recounted to their families how, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, with the broad support of the Indonesian people, they bravely fought against the persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries. To defend the dignity and honor of the motherland, the patriotic overseas Chinese stood firm against the fascist atrocities of the right-wing thugs in Indonesia, demonstrating the great revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people and the revolutionary spirit of loyalty to the motherland and Mao Zedong Thought. The patriotic overseas Chinese, despite the brutal persecution by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works. Many overseas Chinese also entrusted the returning persecuted overseas Chinese to convey their deep longing for the great leader Chairman Mao to the people of the motherland. They expressed to the people of the motherland that they would use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to struggle for the right to live and to defend the friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia.

    爱国华侨热爱毛主席
    在印度尼西亚受尽右派反动势力残酷迫害的一千多名华侨，已经乘光华轮回到祖国。他们从十月三日踏上祖国接侨船的那天起，在七天的航行中，每时每刻都表现出对伟大的社会主义祖国和伟大的领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    这一批受害华侨，都是在印度尼西亚苏门答腊岛上的亚齐地区受到右派暴徒的烧杀、抢劫、殴打和侮辱后，又被印度尼西亚政府强行集中到棉兰的。他们有的被打伤，有的被折磨得身患重病，住在生活条件极为恶劣的受害华侨收容所里，真是度日如年。当光华轮在九月十四日启航前来接运他们回国的消息传来，他们欢腾跳跃，尽情地欢呼：“我们伟大的领袖毛主席派船接我们来了！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    十月三日下午，受害华侨登上了光华轮。在这以前，已有八名华侨被折磨得死在受害华侨收容所里，有些华侨被折磨得病势沉重，危在旦夕。不少人被折磨得面黄肌瘦、骨瘦如柴。有些人上船时，是光华轮的船员用担架从码头上抬走的。侨胞登上船后，见到祖国亲人，回头再望着印度尼西亚武装军人警戒森严的海港码头，激动地说：“船上码头，两个世界，换了人间！”许多侨胞一上船就拥到甲板上热泪盈眶地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祖国万岁！”不少人紧握船员的手说：“你们是毛主席派来的，你们比我们的亲人还亲！”
    受害侨胞一踏上祖国轮船，就表现了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。有位受害华侨老人，首先向船员们打听那儿有毛主席的书。有的人看到船上挂着毛主席在天安门接见百万群众的照片，笑逐颜开，看了又看。十月四日光华轮在马六甲海峡航行的时候，随船的中国政府接侨工作组，代表祖国人民向归国受害侨胞表示亲切的慰问，并向他们赠送了《毛主席语录》。许多受害华侨在接受他们盼望已久的革命宝书时激动得流下了热泪，并且不顾晕船，马上如饥如渴地学习起来。有的老人因为看不清字，就借了放大镜来读毛主席的书。有的高龄老人不识字，就到处请青年讲解，有的老人为了帮助同伴们了解毛主席著作，自己先在深夜仔细阅读。受害华侨青年更是活跃，他们经常围聚在一起读毛主席著作，唱革命歌曲。在航行的几天中，海面上飘荡着《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》的嘹亮歌声。许多青年学了《为人民服务》后，懂得要主动去帮助别人、关心别人，出现了大量扶老携幼、关照病人等好人好事。有些老人欢喜地说：“上船几天，我们的孩子变得真快啊！”青年们高兴地说：“毛主席是世界革命人民的领袖，伟大祖国是世界革命的支柱，是世界革命的中心，是世界革命人民向往的地方。我们作为一个中国人感到自豪！回国后一定要更加听毛主席的话，向红卫兵学习，做新中国的一代新人，积极参加祖国的革命和建设。”
    受害侨胞还向亲人们叙述了他们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在印度尼西亚人民的广泛支持下，同印度尼西亚反动派进行英勇的反迫害斗争的事迹。为了捍卫祖国的尊严和荣誉，爱国华侨在印度尼西亚右派暴徒的法西斯暴行面前威武不屈，表现了中华儿女伟大的革命英雄气概，表现了他们忠于祖国、忠于毛泽东思想的革命硬骨头精神。爱国华侨们，任凭印度尼西亚暴徒和蒋帮分子进行种种胁迫利诱，誓死不背叛祖国。暴徒们强迫华侨喊污辱祖国污辱领袖的口号，华侨们坚决不喊，打也不喊，他们反而高喊“打倒美帝国主义”“打倒印度尼西亚反动派”，而且越打喊声越大。不少爱国华侨在印度尼西亚右派反动势力的残酷迫害下，仍然坚持学习毛主席著作。许多华侨还委托回国的受害华侨，向祖国人民转达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限怀念。他们向祖国人民表示，一定要用毛泽东思想作为武器，为了争取生存的权利，为了保卫中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间的友谊而努力。
