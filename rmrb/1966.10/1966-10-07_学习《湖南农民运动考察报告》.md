The editors of the People's Liberation Army Daily note: Chairman Mao's "Report on the Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," written in 1927, is a brilliant classic work of Marxism-Leninism that guides the proletarian revolutionary movement and addresses the issue of proletarian leadership in peasant revolutionary struggles.

In this great work, Chairman Mao, with a thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, enthusiastically praises the peasant movement, brilliantly summarizes the experience of the peasant movement, vehemently refutes all slanders and attacks by class enemies against the peasant movement, and lays a solid ideological foundation for our party to correctly lead mass movements and for the victory and development of the Chinese revolution. This is the most outstanding example for every revolutionary to correctly handle mass movements. This work has extremely great practical significance for the current proletarian cultural revolution.

The proletarian cultural revolution is a broader and deeper socialist revolution. The conscious participation of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of this great revolution. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, this revolution has become a magnificent mass movement, shaking the nation and the world. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres have launched a fierce attack on a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and on all the ghosts and monsters in society. They are smashing the old customs of the exploiting classes and establishing the new customs of the proletariat. They are studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought extensively, making the entire society's spiritual face completely renewed. Their revolutionary direction is always correct, and their revolutionary actions are truly excellent! It is no surprise that domestic and foreign class enemies are screaming "it's terrible." The more the revolutionary mass movement develops widely and deeply, the closer the enemy's doom approaches. The enemy's shameless slander is nothing new. Chairman Mao refuted it thoroughly 39 years ago.

Chairman Mao said: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The more the enemy curses, the more it proves we are right. We proletarian revolutionary fighters must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, understand the essence and mainstream of the revolutionary mass movement, firmly support the revolutionary mass movement, and resolutely advance the proletarian cultural revolution to the end with the revolutionary masses.

To help comrades in the units study this great work, we have compiled this guide material for reference.

Historical Background

"Report on the Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" was published in March 1927. It was written by Chairman Mao at a critical juncture in the Chinese revolution to refute various criticisms from within and outside the party regarding the peasant revolutionary struggle, and to firmly support the rising peasant revolutionary movement. This is a brilliant classic work of Marxism-Leninism.

At that time, the first domestic revolutionary war led by our party was developing victoriously. The Northern Expedition Army, starting from Guangdong, had reached the Yangtze River basin and occupied half of China. The worker and peasant mass movements were flourishing. The earth-shaking peasant revolutionary struggle was raging across the country, especially in Hunan, the center of the national peasant movement, where it was as fierce as a storm. Millions of peasant masses, with the momentum of a landslide, swept away the reactionary rule of the feudal landlord class, achieving a feat unmatched in thousands of years.

In the face of the rapidly developing revolutionary situation, the counter-revolutionary forces were extremely panicked. They fiercely opposed the Chinese Communist Party, opposed and sabotaged the peasant movement, and suppressed the peasant revolutionary struggle. Imperialism prepared to openly strangle the Chinese revolution with force, while intensifying support for the right-wing of the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek hidden within the revolutionary ranks. Chiang Kai-shek, in particular, revealed his ferocious nature, uniting all reactionary forces to attack the worker and peasant masses, plotting a counter-revolutionary massacre to strangle the revolution.

Within the party, the right-opportunist clique led by Chen Duxiu did not understand the importance of the peasant question, extremely feared and hated the peasant revolutionary struggle, opposed Chairman Mao's correct line, and practiced capitulationism to the landlord bourgeoisie. They were frightened by the counter-revolutionary tide of the Kuomintang reactionaries, not only dared not support the great peasant movement but followed the landlord bourgeoisie, shouting and attacking the peasant movement as "excessive" and "ruined." To appease the Kuomintang reactionaries, they forced the peasants to hand over the rural revolutionary government and peasant armed forces to the landlord class, willing to abandon the peasants, the main ally, making the working class and the Communist Party isolated and helpless, leading the revolution to the path of failure.

In this situation, to lead and promote the peasant movement, save the revolution, and defeat the enemy, Chairman Mao spent 32 days personally investigating the peasant movement in the five counties of Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Hengshan, Liling, and Changsha. He summarized the experience of the peasant movement and wrote the "Report on the Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," solving a series of fundamental problems in the Chinese revolution, thoroughly refuting the attacks and slanders of the landlord bourgeoisie and the right-opportunist clique within the party against the peasant movement, greatly encouraging and supporting the rising Chinese peasant revolutionary struggle, and laying a solid ideological foundation for the victory and development of the Chinese revolution.

Great Significance

Chairman Mao's "Report on the Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" is a brilliant document guiding the proletarian revolutionary movement. In this work, Chairman Mao, starting from the most resolute and thorough revolutionary standpoint of the proletariat, scientifically summarizes the experience of the proletarian-led peasant revolutionary struggle, clearly points out the extreme seriousness of the peasant question, thoroughly solves the central issue of proletarian leadership—the issue of the peasant ally, formulates the party's class line in the countryside, and for the first time proposes the great strategic thought of establishing proletarian-led peasant armed forces and peasant governments. It comprehensively and creatively enriches and develops the Marxist-Leninist theory on the peasant question, making a great contribution to the Marxist-Leninist theoretical treasury.

In this work, Chairman Mao proposes the theory of proletarian leadership in the peasant revolutionary struggle, the establishment of peasant armed forces and rural revolutionary governments, and later develops the great theory of establishing rural revolutionary bases, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing the cities. This is the most precious wealth shared by the Chinese people and revolutionary people all over the world. It is like a lighthouse with countless rays of light, guiding the Chinese revolution to victory and pointing out the realistic path to liberation for the oppressed nations and peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. As more and more revolutionary people master and apply this great theory, it will greatly promote the development of the world people's revolutionary cause and thoroughly bury imperialism and its lackeys and running dogs.

In this great work, Chairman Mao, with the most fervent class feelings and the most vivid language, enthusiastically praises the revolutionary mass movement, greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary masses, and greatly dampens the arrogance of the landlord bourgeoisie. This work deeply expounds the revolutionary viewpoint of trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses extensively, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, laying the theoretical foundation for the party's mass line. Chairman Mao's theory on the revolutionary mass movement is forever the most fundamental guiding ideology for us to carry out revolutionary mass movements and promote the proletarian revolutionary and construction cause. It is forever the source of strength for the world's revolutionary people to strive for liberation.

The brilliant thoughts in this work are the compass for our country's proletarian cultural revolution and a powerful ideological weapon for us revolutionaries to observe problems, distinguish right from wrong, smash all obstacles, and promote the victory of the revolutionary mass movement. Studying Chairman Mao's work seriously and using the great thoughts in this work to guide our thoughts and actions is of special and great significance for us to achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

Main Points

The entire article is divided into eight sections:

1. The Seriousness of the Peasant Question. The rise of the peasant movement is a major issue. In a short period, tens of millions of peasants from the central, southern, and northern provinces of China will rise up, with the momentum of a storm, fierce and swift, and no great force can suppress it. All imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry will be buried by them. All revolutionary parties and comrades will be tested by them and decide to support or oppose. Will you lead them from the front, criticize them from behind, or oppose them from the opposite side? The situation will force everyone to choose quickly.

2. Organization. The peasant movement in Hunan can be roughly divided into two periods: the organizational period and the revolutionary period. With the organization of the peasants, they began to take action, creating an unprecedented rural revolution.

3. Overthrowing Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry, All Power to the Peasant Associations. The main targets of the peasants' attacks are local tyrants and evil gentry, lawless landlords, and various feudal ideas and institutions, as well as corrupt officials in the cities and bad habits in the villages. This attack is like a sudden storm, those who follow it survive, those who resist it perish. The result is that the special privileges of the feudal landlords for thousands of years are swept away. With the landlord power overthrown, the peasant associations become the sole power organs, truly achieving what is called "all power to the peasant associations."

4. "Terrible" and "Excellent." The feudal local tyrants and evil gentry, the lawless landlord class, are the foundation of autocratic politics for thousands of years, the cornerstone of imperialism, warlords, and corrupt officials. The broad masses of peasants overthrowing this feudal force is the true goal of the national revolution. This is an unprecedented feat accomplished in tens or even thousands of years. This is excellent, not at all "terrible." The "terrible" is clearly a counter-revolutionary theory that strikes at the peasants from the standpoint of landlord interests. Every revolutionary comrade should not follow such nonsense.

5. The So-Called "Excessive" Issue. The so-called "excessive" remarks about the peasant movement are essentially a landlord theory that supports the interests of the privileged class. Revolution is not about inviting guests to a banquet, writing articles, or painting and embroidering. It cannot be so elegant, so leisurely, so polite, and so modest. Revolution is an uprising, a violent action of one class overthrowing another. If the peasants do not use great force, they cannot overthrow the deeply rooted landlord power of thousands of years. There must be a great revolutionary tide in the countryside to inspire tens of thousands of masses and form a great force. The so-called "excessive" actions are extremely necessary in the revolutionary period. To correct a distortion, one must overcorrect; otherwise, the distortion cannot be corrected.

6. The So-Called "Hooligan Movement." All those who were once trampled down by the gentry and had no standing or voice in society are now raising their heads and holding power. The so-called "hooligan movement" is completely the counter-revolutionary talk of the Kuomintang right-wing and the gentry.

7. Revolutionary Vanguards. In the countryside, the main force that has been fighting and struggling for a long time is the poor peasants. They listen to the leadership of the Communist Party the most and are the mortal enemies of local tyrants and evil gentry. They have nothing to lose. They are the backbone of the peasant associations, the vanguards of overthrowing feudal forces, and the heroes who accomplish the revolutionary cause. Because they are the most revolutionary, they have obtained the leadership of the peasant associations. Without the poor peasants, there is no revolution. If they are denied, it is a denial of the revolution. If they are attacked, it is an attack on the revolution. Their revolutionary direction has always been correct.

8. Fourteen Major Achievements. (1) Organizing peasants into peasant associations. (2) Politically attacking landlords. (3) Economically attacking landlords. (4) Overthrowing the feudal rule of local tyrants and evil gentry—overthrowing the local militia. (5) Overthrowing the landlord armed forces and establishing peasant armed forces. (6) Overthrowing the power of county magistrates and their subordinates. (7) Overthrowing the clan power of ancestral halls and the god power of city gods, earth gods, and Buddhas, as well as the male power of husbands. (8) Popularizing political propaganda. (9) Peasant prohibitions. (10) Clearing out bandits. (11) Abolishing exorbitant taxes. (12) Cultural movement. (13) Cooperative movement. (14) Building roads and dikes. The fourteen major achievements of the peasants are excellent. Those right-wingers who talk about revolution but are terrified when the masses rise up.

Key Points to Understand

In the current proletarian cultural revolution, we should focus on understanding the following points when studying this great work:

1. The proletarian revolutionary cause is the cause of the people's masses. Without a great mass movement, there is no proletarian revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "Revolution is an uprising, a violent action of one class overthrowing another." Class struggle is a life-and-death struggle. No exploiting class will voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. The proletariat can only rely on the great mass movement of the conscious participation of the broad masses to overthrow the reactionary rule of the exploiting class, establish and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian revolution.

In this work, Chairman Mao points out: "The feudal local tyrants and evil gentry, the lawless landlord class, are the foundation of autocratic politics for thousands of years, the cornerstone of imperialism, warlords, and corrupt officials." "If the peasants do not use great force, they cannot overthrow the deeply rooted landlord power of thousands of years. There must be a great revolutionary tide in the countryside to inspire tens of thousands of masses and form a great force." The peasants of Hunan, in the midst of a roaring revolutionary tide, formed an irresistible force, fiercely attacking the power of the feudal landlords, fundamentally shaking the foundation of feudal rule, and accomplishing a feat unmatched in thousands of years. Currently, in the high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution, the brave revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary students, with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with the force of thunder and lightning, charge forward, and in a short period, make those power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie look disheveled. They drag out those old parasites and bloodsuckers hiding in dark corners, the enemies of the people, one by one. They exhibit their hidden gold and silver treasures and various accounts of rebellion and murder weapons to the public. All the old customs and habits of the exploiting classes are swept out like garbage. They have done a lot of good deeds, achieved brilliant results, and established great merits. This fully proves that any great revolutionary movement is a roaring mass movement. Revolution is originally the conscious demand of the broad masses of the people. They harbor immense revolutionary enthusiasm. Only by mobilizing hundreds of millions of people, unleashing their daring to think, speak, do, and venture, can a great force be formed to break through all obstacles of the old forces and achieve a thorough victory in the revolution.

In the revolutionary tide, the roaring mass movement will inevitably disrupt all the old rules, regulations, and order of the exploiting classes. All class enemies will also shout "excessive" and "abnormal." Chairman Mao refutes the slander of class enemies in this work. Chairman Mao said: "Revolution is not about inviting guests to a banquet, writing articles, or painting and embroidering. It cannot be so elegant, so leisurely, so polite, and so modest." The so-called "excessive" and "abnormal" by the class enemies are actually necessary actions and inevitable phenomena in the revolutionary process. Without the revolutionary actions of the broad masses and the great mass movement, there is no proletarian revolution. In the current proletarian cultural revolution, the broad revolutionary masses put the character "break" first, smashing the old customs of the exploiting classes and establishing the new customs of the proletariat. This is normal and a great thing in our eyes as revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao said: "Only the people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history." (_On the Coalition Government_) We can only rely on the broad masses of the people to overcome all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and do all work well. Without the masses of the people, we will become a tree without roots and a river without a source, and we will achieve nothing. Trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses extensively, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit is Chairman Mao's consistent great thought and the fundamental policy of our party in leading mass movements. In the past, we followed Chairman Mao's great thought, implemented the party's fundamental policy, and achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and socialist revolution. The current proletarian cultural revolution has developed our socialist revolution to a deeper and broader new stage. This is an extremely fierce, sharp, and profound class struggle. Only by fully trusting the masses, relying on the masses, respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, mobilizing the masses extensively, and carrying out revolutionary mass movements can we achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution and truly solve the question of who will win in the ideological realm between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

2. How to treat the revolutionary mass movement is an important dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution, Marxism and revisionism.

How to treat the revolutionary mass movement is an important dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution, Marxism and revisionism. Everyone must reflect their standpoint, viewpoint, and political image on this issue.

Chairman Mao said: "For a thing or a person, there are two opposite views, and two opposite arguments arise. 'Terrible' and 'excellent,' 'hooligans' and 'revolutionary vanguards' are examples." In 1927, the peasants of Hunan, with the momentum of a storm, swept away the special privileges of the feudal landlords for thousands of years, and the broad masses of peasants and revolutionaries were overjoyed. While the landlord class and reactionaries were panicked and extremely hated, they launched various vicious slanders and attacks on the revolutionary actions of the peasants. The current proletarian cultural revolution in our country is the same. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially the revolutionary vanguards, the Red Guards, and revolutionary students, launch a fierce attack on a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, on the ghosts and monsters in society, and on the strongholds of the bourgeoisie. They cleanse all the dirt and filth left over from the old society and sweep away the garbage and filth of the exploiting classes. Their revolutionary actions are warmly praised and cheered by the people of our country and the revolutionary people of the world. Domestic and foreign class enemies are very angry and resentful. They slander the Red Guards as "youthful hotheads" and attack the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards as "destroying social traditions." The completely opposite views and attitudes towards the revolutionary mass movement are determined by two fundamentally opposed class interests and are a reflection of two fundamentally opposed standpoints and worldviews. All exploiting classes are opposed to the broad masses. The more the masses rise up to make a revolution, the closer the death of the exploiting classes approaches. Therefore, those who stand on the side of the exploiting classes must fear the masses and oppose the revolutionary mass movement. The proletariat is a thoroughly revolutionary class. In the revolutionary struggle, the more extensive the masses are mobilized, the larger the scale of the mass movement, the faster the revolution develops, and the more beneficial it is for the thorough liberation of their class. Only by standing firmly on the proletarian standpoint can one share the same fate and breathe the same air with the masses and actively support the revolutionary mass movement.

Dialectical materialism tells us: the development of things is determined by the essence and mainstream of things. Therefore, when we look at problems, we must look at the essence and the mainstream. Eleven years ago, when Chairman Mao criticized some comrades' right-opportunist errors on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, he pointed out: "These comrades' method of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential and mainstream aspects of the problem but emphasize those non-essential and non-mainstream aspects. It should be pointed out: we must not overlook non-essential and non-mainstream aspects of the problem and must solve them one by one. However, we should not regard these as the essence and mainstream, lest we lose our direction." (_On the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization_) The proletarian-led revolutionary mass movement is always in line with the objective laws of social development. The eyes of the revolutionary masses are bright. They can fully grasp the party's policies, distinguish between enemies and friends, clarify right and wrong, and identify true and false. Their revolutionary direction has always been correct. In the revolutionary mass movement, it is inevitable that some local and temporary shortcomings will occur, but these are secondary and inevitable phenomena in the process of advancement. The masses learn to swim while swimming and learn to make a revolution while making a revolution. In the revolutionary movement, the masses will educate themselves, identify what is right and what is wrong, what actions are correct and what actions are incorrect, improve their awareness, increase their abilities, and quickly correct these shortcomings. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary students and cadres in our country, in the proletarian cultural revolution, have always advanced bravely along the correct direction indicated by Chairman Mao. This is the essence and mainstream of the movement. If we do not see the revolutionary direction of the mass movement, do not see the essence and mainstream, regard the secondary as the mainstream, and regard the phenomenon as the essence, we will lose our direction and may be used by the class enemies.

Chairman Mao points out that how to treat the revolutionary mass movement is a serious test for every revolutionary. Chairman Mao is the greatest example of correctly treating the revolutionary mass movement and the most outstanding example of our party in leading mass movements. Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary movement of the masses the most, with his heart connected to the revolutionary masses. In the current proletarian cultural revolution, we should seriously study Chairman Mao's great thoughts and great practices in treating the revolutionary mass movement, oppose all erroneous attitudes that are opposed to the revolutionary mass movement, and enthusiastically support the revolutionary mass movement.

3. Listen to Chairman Mao's words, always be a thorough revolutionary, and a promoter of the revolutionary mass movement.

In this great work, Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary comrades must know: the national revolution needs a great rural upheaval. The Xinhai Revolution did not have this upheaval, so it failed. Now there is this upheaval, which is an important factor for the completion of the revolution. All revolutionary comrades must support this upheaval; otherwise, they will stand on the counter-revolutionary position." The fundamental purpose of our study of Chairman Mao's great work is to listen to Chairman Mao's words, consciously transform our thoughts, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, correctly treat the revolutionary mass movement, always be a thorough revolutionary, and a promoter of the revolutionary mass movement.

The current proletarian cultural revolution is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. It will inevitably encounter various obstacles, and the movement will also experience setbacks and twists and turns. Because the enemies we face are very cunning, vicious, and ruthless. A handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, do everything they can to suppress the mass movement and sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. A handful of reactionary bourgeois elements, untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, they try to bombard our proletarian revolutionary command headquarters. There are also obstacles from the old social habits. In this complex class struggle, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our thoughts and actions, and achieve ideological transformation. Only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought, this most sharp weapon, can we see through the phenomena, understand the essence, see through everything, expose the enemy's tricks, break through obstacles from all sides, and achieve victory in the struggle.

Chairman Mao said: Policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the party. To be a promoter of the revolutionary mass movement, we must firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and act according to the party's policies. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the proletarian cultural revolution, the Sixteen Points, was formulated under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao. This is the programmatic document of our country's proletarian cultural revolution. Firmly implementing and executing the Sixteen Points is the key to achieving a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. We must seriously study the Sixteen Points, familiarize ourselves with the Sixteen Points, master the Sixteen Points, apply the Sixteen Points, and use the Sixteen Points as a weapon. We must insist on political struggle, not armed struggle, enthusiastically support the leftists, and severely attack the rightists and all ghosts and monsters. We must firmly carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The People's Liberation Army, born and grown in the revolutionary struggles of the people, has always regarded the revolutionary mass movement as its own cause. When the people rise up to destroy the old system and struggle hard to transform society and nature, the People's Liberation Army always stands firmly with the people, giving them tremendous support with all their hearts... When the enemy forces try to obstruct and sabotage the revolutionary mass movement, the People's Liberation Army always steps forward to support the people. At the same time, the surging mass movement always inspires and educates the army in return, becoming a revolutionary crucible for tempering and raising the political awareness of the army." (_Raise High the Banner of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong's Military Thought and Advance in Big Strides_) We must follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions and firmly support the revolutionary mass movement. Our army is the main pillar of the proletarian dictatorship and the defender of the socialist system. In the proletarian cultural revolution, one of our important tasks in supporting the revolutionary mass movement is to heighten revolutionary vigilance, guard our posts, do well in preparations, and be ready to smash the sudden attacks of American imperialism and its lackeys at any time, ensuring the thorough victory of our country's proletarian cultural revolution.

    学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》
    解放军报编者按：毛主席在一九二七年写的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，是指导无产阶级革命运动，解决无产阶级领导农民革命斗争问题的一部辉煌的马克思列宁主义经典著作。
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，以无产阶级的彻底革命精神，热情地歌颂了农民运动，天才地总结了农民运动的经验，痛斥了阶级敌人对于农民运动的一切诬蔑和攻击，为我们党正确地领导群众运动，为我国革命的胜利发展，奠定了坚固的思想基础。这是每个革命者正确地对待群众运动的最卓越的典范。这部著作，对于当前的无产阶级文化大革命，具有极其伟大的现实意义。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是更广阔、更深入的社会主义革命，亿万革命群众自觉地参加斗争，是取得这场大革命胜利的根本保证。在毛主席亲自发动和领导下，这场革命已经成为波澜壮阔的伟大群众运动，震动了全国，震动了全世界。广大的工农兵、红卫兵和革命师生、革命干部，向一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，向社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，大学大用毛泽东思想，使整个社会的精神面貌焕然一新。他们的革命大方向始终是正确的，他们的革命行动真是好得很！国内外阶级敌人拚命叫嚷“糟得很”，这是不奇怪的。因为革命的群众运动越是广泛深入地发展，敌人的末日也就越加临近。敌人的这种无耻谰言，并不是什么新鲜玩艺儿，毛主席早在三十九年前就痛快淋漓地驳斥过了。
    毛主席说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”敌人越咒骂，越证明我们做得对。我们无产阶级革命战士要时刻牢记毛主席的教导，站稳无产阶级立场，认清革命的群众运动的本质和主流，坚决支持革命的群众运动，坚定地和革命群众一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    为了帮助连队的同志们学好这部伟大著作，我们编写了这个辅导材料，供学习参考。
    历史背景
    《湖南农民运动考察报告》，发表于一九二七年三月，是毛主席在中国革命的紧要关头，为了答复党内外对农民革命斗争的各种责难，坚决支持正在兴起的农民革命运动而写的。这是一部辉煌的马克思列宁主义经典著作。
    当时，我们党领导的第一次国内革命战争正在胜利发展。从广东出发的北伐军，打到了长江流域，占领了半个中国。工农群众运动蓬勃发展。惊天动地的农民革命斗争，在全国猛烈地开展起来，特别在全国农民运动的中心——湖南，更如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常。千百万农民群众以排山倒海之势，把封建地主阶级的反动统治打得落花流水，这是几千年未曾成就过的奇勋。
    在革命急剧发展的大好形势下，反革命势力极度恐慌。他们疯狂反对中国共产党，反对和破坏农民运动，镇压农民革命斗争。帝国主义准备公开用武力绞杀中国革命，同时加紧扶持隐藏在革命阵营内部的以蒋介石为首的国民党右派。蒋介石更是凶相毕露，联合一切反动势力，对工农群众实行进攻，阴谋发动反革命大屠杀，扼杀革命。
    党内以陈独秀为首的右倾机会主义者，不懂得农民问题的重要性，极端害怕和仇视农民的革命斗争，反对毛主席的正确路线，实行对地主资产阶级的投降主义。他们被国民党反动派的反革命逆流所吓倒，不仅不敢支持伟大的农民运动，反而跟在地主资产阶级的后面，大肆叫嚷和攻击农民运动“过火了”、“搞糟了”。为了迁就国民党反动派，他们硬要农民把农村革命政权和农民武装交给地主阶级，宁愿抛弃农民这个最主要的同盟军，使工人阶级和共产党处于孤立无援的地位，把革命引到失败的路上去。
    在这种情况下，为了领导和推动农民运动，挽救革命，击败敌人，毛主席用了三十二天的时间，亲自考察了湘潭、湘乡、衡山、醴陵、长沙五县农民运动的形势，总结了农民运动的经验，写出了《湖南农民运动考察报告》，解决了中国革命的一系列根本问题，彻底地驳倒了地主资产阶级和党内右倾机会主义者对农民运动的攻击和污蔑，极大地鼓舞和支持了正在兴起的中国农民革命斗争，为中国革命的胜利发展，奠定了坚实的思想基础。
    伟大意义
    毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，是一部指导无产阶级革命运动的光辉文献。毛主席在这一著作中，从无产阶级最坚定最彻底的革命立场出发，科学地总结了无产阶级领导的农民革命斗争的经验，明确地指出了农民问题的极端严重性，透彻地解决了无产阶级领导权的中心问题——农民同盟军问题，制定了党在农村中的阶级路线，第一次提出了关于建立无产阶级领导的农民武装和农民政权的伟大战略思想，全面地、创造性地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义关于农民问题的理论，对马克思列宁主义的理论宝库作出了伟大的贡献。
    毛主席在这部著作中提出的关于无产阶级领导农民革命斗争的理论，关于建立农民武装和农村革命政权，以及后来发展为建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的伟大理论，是中国人民和全世界革命人民共有的最珍贵的财富。它像光芒万丈的灯塔，引导中国革命取得了伟大胜利，也给全世界革命人民，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫民族和被压迫人民指出了争取解放的现实道路。随着这一伟大理论被越来越多的革命人民所掌握，所运用，必将极大地推动世界人民革命事业的发展，彻底埋葬帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗。
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，以最炽烈的阶级感情，最生动的语言，满腔热情地歌颂了革命的群众运动，大长了革命群众的志气，大灭了地主资产阶级的威风。这部著作深刻地阐明了信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众首创精神的革命观点，为党的群众路线奠定了理论基础。毛主席关于革命群众运动的学说，永远是我们大搞革命的群众运动，推动无产阶级革命和建设事业前进的最根本的指导思想，永远是世界革命人民争取解放的力量的源泉。
    毛主席这部著作的光辉思想，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的指南针，是我们革命者观察问题，明辨是非，粉碎一切阻力、推动革命群众运动胜利发展的强大思想武器。认真学习毛主席这一著作，用这一著作中的伟大思想指导我们的思想行动，对于我们取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，具有特别重大的意义。
    段落大意
    全文共分八个问题：
    一、农民问题的严重性。农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题。很短的时间内，将有几万万农民从中国中部、南部和北部各省起来，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，无论什么大的力量都将压抑不住。一切帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，都将被他们葬入坟墓。一切革命的党派、革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？时局将强迫每个人迅速地选择。
    二、组织起来。湖南农民运动大约分为两个时期，即组织时期和革命时期。农民有了广大的组织，便开始行动起来，造成了一个空前的农村大革命。
    三、打倒土豪劣绅，一切权力归农会。农民的主要攻击目标是土豪劣绅，不法地主，旁及各种宗法的思想和制度，城里的贪官污吏，乡村的恶劣习惯。这个攻击的形势，简直是急风暴雨，顺之者存，违之者灭。其结果，把几千年封建地主的特权，打得个落花流水。地主权力既倒，农会便成了唯一的权力机关，真正办到了人们所谓“一切权力归农会”。
    四、“糟得很”和“好得很”。宗法封建性的土豪劣绅，不法地主阶级，是几千年专制政治的基础，帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏的墙脚。广大的农民群众起来打翻这个封建势力，乃是国民革命的真正目标。这是几十年乃至几千年未曾成就过的奇勋。这是好得很。完全不是什么“糟得很”。“糟得很”，明明是站在地主利益方面打击农民的反革命的理论。每个革命的同志，都不应该跟着瞎说。
    五、所谓“过分”的问题。对农民运动所谓“过分”的议论，其实质依然是拥护特权阶级利益的地主理论。革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。农民若不用极大的力量，决不能推翻几千年根深蒂固的地主权力。农村中须有一个大的革命热潮，才能鼓动成千成万的群众，形成一个大的力量。所谓“过分”的举动，在革命时期是非常之需要的。矫枉必须过正，不过正不能矫枉。
    六、所谓“痞子运动”。一切从前被绅士们打在泥沟里，在社会上没有了立足地位，没有了发言权的人，现在居然伸起头来，而且掌权了。所谓“痞子运动”，完全是国民党右派、绅士们的反革命议论。
    七、革命先锋。乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。他们最听共产党的领导，是土豪劣绅的死对头。他们不怕失掉什么。他们是农民协会的中坚，打倒封建势力的先锋，是成就革命大业的元勋。贫农，因为最革命，所以他们取得了农会的领导权。没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。他们的革命大方向始终没有错。
    八、十四件大事。（一）将农民组织在农会里。（二）政治上打击地主。（三）经济上打击地主。（四）推翻土豪劣绅的封建统治——打倒都团。（五）推翻地主武装，建立农民武装。（六）推翻县官老爷衙门差役的政权。（七）推翻祠堂族长的族权和城隍土地菩萨的神权以至丈夫的男权。（八）普及政治宣传。（九）农民诸禁。（十）清匪。（十一）废苛捐。（十二）文化运动。（十三）合作社运动。（十四）修道路，修塘坝。农民做的十四件大事好得很。那些右派口谈革命，但群众起来了又害怕得要死。
  要着重领会的问题
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，我们学习这部伟大著作，要着重领会以下几个问题：
    一、无产阶级的革命事业是人民群众自己的事业。没有伟大的群众运动，就没有无产阶级革命
    毛主席说：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”阶级斗争是你死我活的激烈斗争。一切剥削阶级都不会自动退出历史舞台。无产阶级只有依靠广大群众自觉参加的伟大的群众运动，才能推翻剥削阶级的反动统治，建立和巩固无产阶级专政的政权，取得无产阶级革命的彻底胜利。
    毛主席在这部著作中指出：“宗法封建性的土豪劣绅，不法地主阶级，是几千年专制政治的基础，帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏的墙脚。”“农民若不用极大的力量，决不能推翻几千年根深蒂固的地主权力。农村中须有一个大的革命热潮，才能鼓动成千成万的群众，形成一个大的力量。”湖南农民正是在轰轰烈烈的革命热潮中，形成了极大的力量，以锐不可挡之势，向着封建地主的权力猛烈冲击，从根本上动摇了封建统治的基础，完成了几千年未曾成就过的奇勋。当前，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，英勇的革命红卫兵和革命师生，在广大工农兵群众的热烈支持下，以雷霆万钧之力，冲锋陷阵，在短短的时间内，把那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，资产阶级的反动“权威”，搞得狼狈不堪，把那些躲藏在阴暗角落里的老寄生虫，吸血鬼，人民的仇敌，一个个地揪了出来。把这些家伙隐藏的金银财宝和各种变天账、杀人武器，统统拿出来展览示众。一切剥削阶级的旧风俗、旧习惯，都像垃圾一样，被他们扫地出门。他们办了大量的好事，取得了辉煌的战果，建立了很大的功勋。这充分说明，任何大革命运动，都是轰轰烈烈的群众运动。革命本来就是广大人民群众的自觉要求，他们中间蕴藏着极大的革命积极性。只有把亿万群众动员起来，发挥他们敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命积极性，才能形成巨大的力量，冲破一切旧势力的阻挠，取得革命的彻底胜利。
    在革命热潮中造成的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，必然要把一切剥削阶级的旧章法、旧规矩、旧秩序统统打乱，一切阶级敌人也总是会叫喊“过火”了，“反常”了。毛主席在这部著作中有力地驳斥了阶级敌人的这种诬蔑。毛主席说：“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。”阶级敌人所谓的“过火”、“反常”，其实正是革命过程中必要的举动，必然的现象。没有广大群众的这种革命举动，没有伟大的群众运动，就没有无产阶级革命。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众“破”字当头，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新。这在我们革命者看来是正常的，是大好事。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”（《论联合政府》）我们只有依靠广大人民群众，才能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人，做好一切工作。离开人民群众，我们就会成为无源之水，无本之木，我们就将一事无成。信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，是毛主席一贯的伟大思想，是我们党领导群众运动的根本方针。过去我们遵循毛主席的这一伟大思想，贯彻党的这一根本方针，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利。当前的无产阶级文化大革命，使我国社会主义革命发展到一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段，这是一场极其激烈、极其尖锐、极其深刻的阶级斗争。也只有充分信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，放手发动群众，大搞革命的群众运动，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，真正解决在意识形态领域中无产阶级和资产阶级之间谁战胜谁的问题。
    二、怎样对待革命的群众运动，是区分革命和反革命、真革命和假革命、马克思主义和修正主义的重要的分水岭
    怎样对待革命的群众运动，是区分革命和反革命、真革命和假革命、马克思主义和修正主义的一个重要的分水岭。一切人在这个问题面前，都必然要反映出他们的立场、观点和政治面貌。
    毛主席说：“对于一件事或一种人，有相反的两种看法，便出来相反的两种议论。‘糟得很’和‘好得很’，‘痞子’和‘革命先锋’，都是适例。”一九二七年，湖南农民以暴风骤雨之势，把几千年封建地主的特权，打得落花流水，广大农民和革命派无不拍手称快，欢欣鼓舞。而地主阶级和反动派则惊慌不安，极端仇恨，对农民的革命行动发出种种恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。我国当前的无产阶级文化大革命也是这样。广大的工农兵群众，特别是革命的急先锋红卫兵和革命师生们，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，向社会上的牛鬼蛇神，向资产阶级的顽固堡垒猛烈开火，荡涤旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水，清扫剥削阶级的垃圾脏物。他们的革命行动，得到我国人民和全世界革命人民热烈的赞扬和欢呼。国内外阶级敌人则十分恼火和愤恨。他们诬蔑红卫兵是“少年狂热分子”，攻击红卫兵的革命行动，是“破坏社会传统”。对待革命的群众运动的这种截然不同的看法和态度，是两种根本对立的阶级利益决定的，是两种根本对立的立场和世界观的反映。一切剥削阶级，都是和广大群众相对立的。群众越是起来闹革命，剥削阶级的死亡，就越加临近。因此，站在剥削阶级立场上的人，必然害怕群众，反对革命的群众运动。无产阶级是彻底革命的阶级，在革命斗争中，群众发动得越广泛，群众运动的规模越大，革命的发展就越迅速，就越有利于本阶级的彻底解放。只有站在坚定的无产阶级的立场上，才能和群众同命运，共呼吸，才能积极支持革命的群众运动。
    辩证唯物主义告诉我们：事物的发展是由事物的本质和主流方面决定的。因此，我们看问题一定要看本质，看主流。十一年前，毛主席在批评一些同志在农业合作化问题上的右倾机会主义错误的时候，就曾经指出：“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。应当指出：不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，必须逐一地将它们解决。但是，不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。”（《关于农业合作化问题》）无产阶级领导的革命的群众运动，总是和社会发展的客观规律相符合的。革命群众的眼睛是雪亮的，他们完全能够掌握党的政策，分清敌我，明辨是非，识别真假，他们的革命大方向始终没有错。在革命的群众运动中，难免也会发生某些局部性、暂时性的缺点，但这毕竟是次要的，是前进中不可避免的现象。群众是在游泳中学会游泳，在革命中学会革命的。群众在革命运动中，会自己教育自己，识别哪些是对的，哪些是错的，哪些做法是正确的，哪些做法是不正确的，会提高觉悟，增长才干，迅速纠正这些缺点。我国的广大工农兵、红卫兵和革命师生、革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，始终沿着毛主席指引的正确方向奋勇前进，这就是运动的本质和主流。如果看不到群众运动的革命大方向，看不到本质和主流，把支流当主流，把现象当本质，就会迷失方向，甚至被阶级敌人所利用。
    毛主席指出，对待革命的群众运动，采取什么态度，是站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？这对每个革命者都是一个严重的考验。毛主席是正确对待革命群众运动的最伟大的榜样，是我们党领导群众运动的最卓越的典范。毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，和革命群众心连心。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，我们应当认真地学习毛主席对待革命群众运动的伟大思想和伟大实践，反对一切同革命群众运动相对立的错误态度，满腔热情地支持革命的群众运动。
    三、听毛主席的话，永远做彻底的革命派，做革命群众运动的促进派
      毛主席在这部伟大著作中教导我们：“一切革命同志须知：国民革命需要一个大的农村变动。辛亥革命没有这个变动，所以失败了。现在有了这个变动，乃是革命完成的重要因素。一切革命同志都要拥护这个变动，否则他就站到反革命立场上去了。”我们学习毛主席的这部伟大著作，根本目的就在于听毛主席的话，自觉地改造思想，牢固地树立无产阶级世界观，正确地对待革命的群众运动，永远做彻底的革命派，做革命群众运动的促进派。
    当前的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场极为尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争。必然会遇到种种阻力，运动也会出现反复和曲折。因为我们面对的敌人是十分狡猾、阴险、毒辣的。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，打着“红旗”反红旗，千方百计地压制群众运动，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。一小撮反动资产阶级分子，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右五类分子，他们企图炮打我们无产阶级的革命司令部。还有来自旧社会的习惯势力，也是运动的阻力。在这种复杂的阶级斗争中，我们必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来统帅自己的思想和行动，实现思想革命化。只有掌握毛泽东思想这一最锐利的武器，才能透过现象，看清本质，洞察一切，识破敌人的阴谋诡计，击破来自各方面的阻力，取得斗争的胜利。
    毛主席说：政策和策略是党的生命。我们要做革命群众运动的促进派，就要坚定不移地听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，按党的政策办事。中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，即十六条，是在毛主席亲自主持下制定的，这是我国无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件。坚决贯彻和执行十六条，这是取得无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的关键。我们一定要认真地学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，以十六条为武器，坚持文斗，不要武斗，热情地支持左派，狠狠地打击右派和一切牛鬼蛇神，坚决地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    林彪同志说：“从人民群众的革命斗争中诞生和成长起来的中国人民解放军，历来把革命的群众运动看成是自己的事。当人民群众起来破坏旧制度，为改造社会和自然的面貌而进行艰苦斗争的时候，人民解放军总是紧紧地同人民站在一起，满腔热情地给人民以巨大的支援……。当敌对势力企图阻挠和破坏革命的群众运动的时候，人民解放军总是挺身而出，为群众撑腰。同时，汹涌澎湃的群众运动，又总是反过来大大鼓舞和教育了军队，成为锻炼和提高军队政治觉悟的革命熔炉。”（《高举党的总路线和毛泽东军事思想的红旗阔步前进》）我们一定要按照林彪同志的指示，坚决地支持革命的群众运动。我军是无产阶级专政的主要支柱，是社会主义制度的保卫者。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们支持革命群众运动的一个重要任务，就是要提高革命警惕，坚守岗位，做好战备，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的突然进攻，保证我国无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利。
