Edition: 2

Petroleum fermentation dewaxing is a new technology that began to develop internationally in the 1960s. It uses microorganisms that can "eat wax" to absorb the large amounts of wax contained in petroleum, thereby refining the petroleum. This method can be used to refine various types of low-pour-point oils for high-altitude and high-cold environments, suitable for high-precision instruments. It can also produce a large amount of high-protein yeast for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries, which is of great significance for strengthening national defense construction and developing new technologies. Refining high-grade oils using this method has the advantages of simple equipment, low construction investment, quick results, and easy operation. Currently, the production of low-pour-point petroleum products generally uses solvent, cold pressing, and urea dewaxing methods.

    什么是石油发酵脱蜡
    石油发酵脱蜡是六十年代国际上才开始发展起来的一项新技术，它是用一种可以“吃蜡”的微生物吸收石油中所含大量石蜡的方法来精制石油。用这种方法，可以精制各种高空、高寒环境下使用的高级精密仪器用的低凝点油；还可以生产大量供食品、医药等工业使用的高蛋白酵母，这对加强国防建设、发展新技术等都具有重大意义。用这种方法精制高级油品，具有设备简单、建设投资少、收效快、操作技术容易掌握等优点。目前制取低凝点石油产品，一般采用溶剂、冷榨、尿素等脱蜡方法。
