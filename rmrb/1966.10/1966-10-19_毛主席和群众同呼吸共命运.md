On October 18th, a bright red sun rose from the east, casting its radiant light over Beijing. Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao and other central leaders, rode in open-top cars to review, for the fourth time, 1.5 million Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country.

At 12:50 PM, the solemn melody of "The East Is Red" played. One by one, brand-new open-top cars, led by a formation of motorcycles in a V-shape, sped along the fifty-mile-long red review route.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, stood radiantly on the first open-top car, appearing before the jubilant crowd.

Comrade Lin Biao stood brilliantly on the second open-top car, closely following Chairman Mao, and together they reviewed the cultural revolution army.

The revolutionary masses sitting along the sides of the road waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" like countless revolutionary red hearts flying towards our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" echoed throughout Beijing.

The Red Guards from Yanji County, Jilin Province, standing in front of the North Gate of the Great Hall of the People, were the happiest people in the world today. Chairman Mao came to them first. Emotional tears blurred their vision, and their blood boiled with excitement. Countless words condensed into one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

These Korean Red Guards had just arrived in Beijing on the 17th. This morning, they wore the Chairman Mao badges given to them by the Beijing Red Guards and came to Tiananmen Square, where they saw the Chairman Mao they had longed for day and night. They said, "Chairman Mao is so healthy; this is the greatest happiness for all the people of the country."

More than 5,800 revolutionary students from the Jinggangshan area also saw Chairman Mao first today. Before they left, the people of the old revolutionary base repeatedly reminded them, "Chairman Mao cares the most about the people, trusts the people the most. The people of Jinggangshan miss Chairman Mao and look up to Chairman Mao." A 60-year-old veteran from Yongxin County, Yin Zhen, told his son Yin Wenxian, "In the past, Chairman Mao often came to Yongxin. He wore straw shoes and stood with us to eat, leading us to fight against landlords and distribute land. This time you go to Beijing, you must greet Chairman Mao on our behalf and tell us in detail what you saw." Today, Yin Wenxian saw Chairman Mao and excitedly said, "The older generation of revolutionaries in the Jinggangshan area drew strength from Chairman Mao in the most difficult times and persisted in the struggle. We must follow the older generation and, under Chairman Mao's guidance, resolutely carry the socialist revolution to the end."

From August 18th, when Chairman Mao first received the cultural revolution army at Tiananmen, to today, exactly two months have passed. During these two months, Chairman Mao has received the revolutionary masses four times and, on National Day, reviewed the parade of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary students. The scale of the masses and the momentum were unprecedented in China and the world. Chairman Mao meeting with so many masses, personally going among the masses, and being with the masses, Chairman Mao is the most brilliant example of the Party's connection with the masses. Many Red Guards excitedly said: Chairman Mao, despite his hardships, has received the revolutionary masses multiple times. This is a great encouragement to the people of the entire country and a great impetus to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Chairman Mao is coming! Chairman Mao is coming!"

The fifty-mile-long red road was filled with cheers, shaking the earth and mountains. People waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao," with every excited face and every passionate gaze focused on the endless road ahead.

The students from Shanghai Dongfanghong Middle School were particularly anxious. On the 17th, they heard the news on the train that Chairman Mao would receive the revolutionary students again and felt that the train stopped too many times and took too long, fearing they might miss the important event. Early this morning, as soon as they got off the train, they didn't eat or find a place to stay, but rushed to join the review line. When they finally saw Chairman Mao, one of the Red Guards wrote in his "Quotations from Chairman Mao": "At 1:03 PM on October 18, 1966, Chairman Mao came to see us. I finally saw my beloved leader, Chairman Mao, whom I have longed for day and night. Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Chairman Mao stood on the review car, constantly waving to the crowd. The crowd became even more excited. Seeing Chairman Mao was not just for themselves; each person represented countless others. A large part of the reviewed revolutionary masses were representatives of middle school students from various places. After the representatives from Chongqing Shuangliu County were selected, the workers in the county said, "These are our representatives!" The barbers hurried to give them haircuts; the food factory workers rushed to make dry rations for them; the truck drivers decorated the cars and sent them on their way. When they expressed their thanks for the workers' support and help, the workers said, "No need to thank us. You go to Tiananmen and shout 'Long live Chairman Mao' for us more times, wishing him eternal life!"

These revolutionary students, carrying the hearts of the people from all over the country, came to Beijing. The first thing they did after getting off the train was to go to Tiananmen. More than a thousand revolutionary students from Hainan Island came to Tiananmen Square and saw the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, reluctant to leave. Some touched the railing of the Golden Water Bridge and said, "Chairman Mao must have touched this railing." Some looked at the water under the Golden Water Bridge and said, "Chairman Mao must have seen this water." Some sat down on the spot where Chairman Mao had sat on the Golden Water Bridge, excitedly saying, "I am sitting next to Chairman Mao." Some hoped Chairman Mao would suddenly appear on the Tiananmen City Tower. Some hoped Chairman Mao would suddenly come out and wave to everyone. Now, Chairman Mao is truly by their side, waving to them, how could they not shout with all their hearts?

Chairman Mao's car was still far away, and people were extremely anxious, feeling that the car was moving too slowly. Everyone hoped: Car, go faster, go faster, let us see Chairman Mao sooner.

Chairman Mao's car passed by, and people felt the car was moving too fast. Everyone hoped: Car, go slower, go slower, let us see Chairman Mao more.

Chairman Mao's car had gone far away, and people were still passionately expressing their immense happiness at seeing Chairman Mao. A student from the East China Communist Labor University said what was in everyone's heart: "When Chairman Mao passed by us, it was only for a moment, but this moment is unforgettable."

At around 1:50 PM, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao reached the end of the review, waving to the surrounding revolutionary masses. The crowd standing on both sides of the road reached the peak of joy. They could not contain their extremely excited and happy feelings, reluctant to leave.

Chairman Mao's car had already passed, but a young Red Guard from East China was still looking at the departing car, shouting enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" Some classmates next to him said, "Chairman Mao has already left." She said, "No, Chairman Mao is always with us."

Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' pioneering spirit the most. Chairman Mao breathes with the masses, shares their fate, and is always connected with the masses.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is Chairman Mao who has most resolutely supported the masses' revolutionary struggle and the masses' pioneering spirit.

When the first revolutionary big-character poster was just put up at Peking University and was being attacked by the capitalist-roaders in power, who supported the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University? It was not someone else, but our great commander Chairman Mao.

When the Red Guards were just emerging and were being persecuted by some people, who supported the Red Guards? It was not someone else, but our great commander Chairman Mao.

In just a few months, revolutionary big-character posters were put up all over the cities and towns across the country, and the Red Guards developed into a vast revolutionary force that shook the heavens and the earth. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shook the entire society and the whole world. All the ghosts and monsters saw the revolutionary big-character posters and the revolutionary Red Guards, and they trembled with fear. All those who feared the masses and the revolution were also anxious.

Who supported the revolutionary teachers and students' great linking-up? It was not someone else, but our great commander Chairman Mao.

In just a few months, the revolutionary great linking-up had become one of the best ways for students to educate themselves. They distinguished right from wrong in the linking-up, familiarized themselves with society, familiarized themselves with the masses, familiarized themselves with class struggle, and turned the cultural revolution across the country into one, making themselves grow rapidly in the revolutionary great furnace of linking-up.

Among the revolutionary masses from outside who were received today, there were many revolutionary students who were the vanguard in fighting against the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line. They had been suppressed for a long time, but they persisted in the struggle and opened up the situation.

Who gave them the courage and strength? It was the great leader Chairman Mao.

Today, Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country accepted Chairman Mao's review, their fighting spirit was higher, and their courage was greater. Many people swore: They would definitely defend and carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line!

Some Red Guards from the Zunyi area said: Our great helmsman Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us at every critical moment of the revolution. After the Zunyi Conference established the correct line represented by Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution has continuously moved from victory to victory. Today, Chairman Mao personally leads the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and leads us to fight against the reactionary bourgeois line. We will advance bravely along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao and will definitely accomplish the historical mission of the cultural revolution!

    毛主席和群众同呼吸共命运
    毛主席来到我们身边
    十月十八日，一轮红彤彤的太阳从东方升起，灿烂的阳光铺满北京城。我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，和他亲密的战友林彪同志，以及中央其他负责同志，乘敞篷汽车，第四次检阅了来自全国各地的一百五十万红卫兵和革命师生。
    中午十二时五十分，响起了庄严的《东方红》乐曲声。一辆辆崭新的敞篷汽车，由一列排成箭头形的摩托车队作前导，驰向五十里长的红色检阅大道。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，穿着草绿色军装，容光焕发地站在第一辆敞篷汽车上，出现在欢腾的群众面前。
    林彪同志神采奕奕地站在第二辆敞篷汽车上，紧跟着毛主席，和毛主席一起检阅了文化革命大军。
    车道两侧席地而坐的革命群众，挥动着《毛主席语录》，像千百万颗革命的红心，飞向我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻整个北京城。
    排列在人民大会堂北门前的吉林省延吉县红卫兵，今天是世界上最幸福的人。毛主席首先来到他们身边。激动的热泪蒙住了他们的双眼，沸腾的热血激荡着他们的全身。千言万语并成了一句话：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    这些朝鲜族红卫兵，是十七日刚到北京的。今天清晨，他们就佩戴着首都红卫兵给他们送来的毛主席像纪念章，来到了天安门广场，看见了日夜想念的毛主席。他们说：“毛主席这么健康，这是全国各族人民最大的幸福。”
    来自井冈山地区的五千八百多名革命师生，今天也最早看见了毛主席。他们动身前，老革命根据地群众再三向他们叮嘱：“毛主席最关心群众，最相信群众，我们井冈山人民怀念着毛主席，心向着毛主席。”永新县六十多岁的老赤卫队员尹珍，对他的儿子尹文先说：“当年，毛主席他老人家常来永新。他穿着草鞋，和我们一起站着吃饭，领导我们打土豪分田地。你这次到北京，一定要替我们向毛主席问候，要把看见毛主席的情形，回来详细告诉我们。”今天，尹文先看到了毛主席，他激动地说：“井冈山地区的老一辈革命人民，在最艰苦困难的日子里，从毛主席那里得到鼓舞，坚持了斗争。我们一定要像老一辈人那样，在毛主席指引下，坚决将社会主义革命进行到底。”
    从八月十八日，毛主席第一次在天安门接见文化革命大军，到今天整整是两个月。在这两个月当中，毛主席四次接见革命群众，在国庆节还检阅了工农兵代表和革命师生的游行队伍。群众规模之大，声势之盛，在中国，在世界，都是史无前例的。毛主席同那么多的群众见面，亲自到群众中去，同群众在一起，毛主席是全党联系群众的最光辉的榜样。许多红卫兵兴奋地说：毛主席这样不辞辛苦，多次接见革命群众，这是对全国人民的极大鼓舞，是对无产阶级文化大革命的巨大推动。
    亿万人民心向毛主席
    “毛主席来了！”“毛主席来了！”
    五十里红色大道欢声雷动，地动山摇。人们挥动着《毛主席语录》，欢呼着“毛主席万岁”，一张张激动的脸，一双双热情的目光，都集中到一眼望不到头的车道的前方。
    上海东方红三中的同学们特别着急。他们十七日在火车上听到毛主席又要接见革命师生的喜讯时，总嫌列车停站次数太多，时间太长，深怕耽误了大事。今天一早，刚下火车，饭也不吃，住宿地点也不找，就赶来参加了接受检阅的行列。当他们终于见到毛主席时，他们中的一位红卫兵，在《毛主席语录》本上写着：“一九六六年十月十八日下午一时零三分，毛主席来看我们了，我终于看见了我日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    毛主席站在检阅车上，不断地向群众挥手致意。群众更加欢腾了。他们见到毛主席，不只是他们个人见到毛主席。他们每一个人，都代表许许多多人。这次受检阅的革命群众，很大一部分是各地选出来的中学生的代表。四川省双流县中学生代表选出后，县里的工人说：“这是我们的代表！”理发工人忙着为他们理发；食品厂工人为他们赶制干粮；汽车司机扎彩车，送他们上路。他们对工人的支持和帮助表示感谢时，工人们说：“不用谢，你们到天安门替我们多喊几声毛主席万岁，祝他老人家万寿无疆！”
    这些带着全国人民的心意来到北京的革命学生，下了火车的第一件事，就是到天安门去。从海南岛来的一千多革命学生，到了天安门广场，看到毛主席的巨幅画像，久久不愿离去。有的摸着金水桥上的栏杆说：“毛主席一定摸过这里的栏杆。”有的看着金水桥下的水说：“毛主席也看过这里的水吧？！”有的在金水桥上毛主席坐过的地方坐下来，激动地说：“我坐在毛主席身边了。”有的希望毛主席忽然出现在天安门城楼上。有的希望毛主席忽然走出来向大家招手。现在，毛主席真的来到自己身边，向自己招手，他们怎能不尽情地欢呼呢？
    毛主席乘的车还在远处，人们万分焦急，总觉得车开得太慢了。一个个全都盼望着：车啊，快点开，快点开，让我们早一点见到毛主席。
    毛主席乘的车从自己身旁过去，人们又觉得车开得太快了。一个个全都盼望着：车啊，慢点开，慢点开，让我们再看看毛主席。
    毛主席乘的车走远了，人们还在热烈地倾吐着自己见到毛主席的无比幸福。江西共产主义劳动大学的一位同学，说出了大家心里的话：“毛主席从我们身旁走过的时候，虽然只有一刹那的工夫，这却是永生难忘的一刹那。”
    沿着毛主席开辟的航道前进
    下午一时五十多分，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志到达检阅终点，向周围革命群众挥手致意。站在大道两旁人山人海的群众，出现了欢乐的最高潮。人们抑制不住万分激动、万分幸福的心情，恋恋不舍，不肯离去。
    毛主席的车子早已开过去了，一个华东来的红卫兵小将还翘首望着远去的车子，尽情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”旁边有的同学说：“毛主席已经走了。”她说：“不，毛主席永远和我们在一起。”
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最信任群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的首创精神。毛主席和群众同呼吸，共命运，永远和群众心连心。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，是毛主席最坚决地支持了群众的革命斗争，最坚决地支持了群众的首创精神。
    当北大第一张革命的大字报刚刚贴出，正遭到走资本主义道路的当权派攻击时，是谁支持北大的革命师生呢？不是别人，是我们的伟大的统帅毛主席。
    当红卫兵刚刚露苗，还遭受到一些人的摧残时，是谁支持红卫兵呢？不是别人，也是我们的伟大统帅毛主席。
    短短几个月的时间，革命的大字报贴遍了全国各地的大中城市，红卫兵发展成为惊天动地的广大群众的革命队伍。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动震动了整个社会，震动了全世界。一切牛鬼蛇神看到革命的大字报、革命的红卫兵，就吓得发抖。一切怕群众、怕革命的人，也惶惶不安。
    又是谁支持了革命师生的大串连呢？不是别人，还是我们伟大的统帅毛主席。
    短短几个月的时间，革命大串连已经成了学生自己教育自己的最好方式之一。他们在串连中辨别是非，熟悉社会，熟悉群众，熟悉阶级斗争，把全国的文化大革命打成一片，使自己在串连的革命大熔炉里，受到各种锻炼，迅速成长起来。
    今天被接见的外地来京革命群众当中，有不少革命学生，是同党内走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线斗争的急先锋。他们曾经长时间受到压制，可是他们坚持了斗争，打开了局面。
    是谁给了他们勇气和力量？是伟大的领袖毛主席。
    今天，来自全国各地的红卫兵和革命师生，接受了毛主席的检阅，斗志更高，勇气更足。许多人宣誓：一定要坚决捍卫和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，一定要彻底批判资产阶级反动路线！
    来自遵义地区的一些红卫兵说：我们伟大的舵手毛主席，在革命的每一个关键时刻，为我们指明航向。遵义会议确立了以毛主席为代表的正确路线以后，中国革命就不断地从胜利走向胜利。今天，毛主席亲自领导无产阶级文化大革命，领导我们同资产阶级反动路线作斗争。我们沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道勇往直前，就一定能胜利完成文化大革命的历史使命！
