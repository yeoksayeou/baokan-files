Editor's Note: The Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe's revolutionary modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has undergone multiple revisions and improvements, presenting itself in a new form to the capital's broad audience once again.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" was born in the midst of sharp and complex class struggles. Since Chairman Mao issued the call at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to "never forget class struggle," the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology on the cultural front has further intensified. Revolutionary playwrights across the country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have launched an attack on Peking opera, the most stubborn stronghold of performances about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, revolutionizing it from its ideological content to its artistic form. The Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is one of the outstanding fruits of this battle to seize the Peking opera stronghold.

The revolution of Peking opera has touched the roots of the culture of the exploiting classes. Those bourgeois agents who have infiltrated the Party and seized leadership positions in the literary and artistic circles, and those remnants of the feudal class, have sensed their impending doom. In their desperate hour, they are making their final struggles. They have launched open and covert attacks on revolutionary modern Peking operas, with frenzied intensity. The deputy leader of the revisionist clique of Zhou Yang, Lin Mohan, after meticulous planning behind the scenes, had his lackeys publicly publish articles in newspapers to defame the revolutionary masterpiece "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," attempting to use this to attack Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts. However, their plots did not succeed.

At the National Modern Peking Opera Observation and Performance Conference in 1964, outstanding revolutionary modern Peking operas such as "The Red Lantern," "The White-Haired Girl," and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" received enthusiastic welcome from the broad audience. The revolution of Peking opera achieved great victory.

In the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary comrades of the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe, with the spirit of continuous revolution, have continuously revised and improved "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," making the play significantly better in both ideological and artistic aspects. The play more prominently praises Chairman Mao's people's war thoughts and more prominently portrays the heroic figures of revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought. It has also achieved a better unity of political content and artistic form.

The success of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a fruit of the Cultural Revolution. The process of creation, performance, and revision of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" by the revolutionary comrades of the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe is a process of highlighting Mao Zedong Thought and adhering to the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. It is also a process of the proletarian literary line and the bourgeois literary line confronting each other head-on. The facts have proven that only by thoroughly criticizing bourgeois ideology can proletarian ideology be established; only by overthrowing the reactionary artistic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie can proletarian literature and art develop and flourish further.

The Heroic Figure Radiating the Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought

The revolutionary modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" performed by the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe is a highly ideological and artistic masterpiece. We watched it and were deeply moved and greatly inspired.

The setting of this play is in the early days of the War of Liberation—in the winter of 1946. It tells the story of our army's pursuit squad, following Chairman Mao's directive to "establish a solid Northeast base," venturing into the forest and snowfields, mobilizing the masses in the Mudanjiang area, and eliminating the bandits nestled in the deep mountains. It portrays a group of heroic figures radiating the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, among whom the heroic image of the reconnaissance platoon leader Yang Zhirong is particularly prominent.

Yang Zhirong is a hero nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the revolutionary fires. He has boundless love and loyalty to the Party, the people, and the revolutionary cause; his stance is firm, his hatred and love are clear, and his class feelings are intense; his heart is broad, his vision is far-reaching, and he takes the liberation of all people as his mission; he is brave and fearless, wise and calm, unafraid of sacrifice, and possesses the heroic spirit of overcoming all enemies without being overwhelmed by them. His every action radiates the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and shines with the luster of high revolutionary heroism.

The play first depicts Yang Zhirong's deep and intense class feelings for the people. After the pursuit squad arrived in the forest and snowfields, they immediately visited the poor, established roots, and connected with the people, treating the people's sufferings as their own. In the scene "Visiting the Poor," Yang Zhirong, after hearing Chang Bao's accusation of the bandits' arson, looting, and killing of her grandmother and mother, was instantly filled with a surge of intense class feelings: "Little Chang Bao accused the bandits' crimes, every word was blood, every sound was tears, stirring up my heart with hatred. All oppressed people in the world have a book of blood and tears, seeking revenge, seeking justice, blood debts must be repaid with blood." He also took off his food bag and left it with Chang Bao's father and daughter, advising them to move temporarily to avoid the bandits' persecution.

Through this scene, the play vividly displays Yang Zhirong's noble inner world nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, explaining the ideological foundation of Yang Zhirong's heroic character. Yang Zhirong, with a heart full of determination to avenge the mountain people and eliminate the stubborn bandits to consolidate the rear, conducted thorough investigations and analyses, and requested from the battalion commander, Shao Jianbo, the arduous task of "disguising as a bandit and infiltrating Tiger Mountain." He declared: "Communist Party members always heed the Party's call, choosing the heaviest burdens to bear, 'knowing the journey is fraught with danger, the more dangerous, the more forward,' 'a red heart like a flame, turning into a sword to slay the stubborn and evil!' Here, a heroic image of someone who is willing to brave fire and water for the people, choosing the heaviest burdens, is further revealed.

After accepting the mission, Yang Zhirong left his commander and comrades, "crossing the forest and snowfields," and "climbing the mountain to fight the tiger." Although he was alone, although he was in the lion's den, he was "spirit soaring," facing the towering mountains, expressing such great ambition: "Wishing the red flag to wave over the five continents and four seas, even if it is a sea of fire and a mountain of knives, I will charge forward. I wish the flying snow could quickly turn into spring water, welcoming spring to change the world." The audience, watching this, seems to see a towering mountain standing before them. Who would not admire and be moved by Yang Zhirong's towering heroic spirit, that fiery red heart, and that sublime ideal!

"Party gives me wisdom, gives me courage, facing a thousand difficulties and ten thousand dangers with ease." Yang Zhirong, with a brave heart, took big steps, continuing to advance into the vast, snow-covered, and misty snowfields.

If climbing the mountain to fight the tiger initially showed Yang Zhirong's heroic character, then when he entered the bandits' den and came to the Tiger Hall, it was a further elevation of his heroic character. He stood tall and proud, calm and composed, in front of the cunning enemies; he was agile and adept, handling everything with ease, in the midst of the ferocious wolf pack. When Seatiger Mountain was questioning his identity and the origin of the map, Yang Zhirong, facing the enemy, remained calm and composed, answering fluently, gaining the enemy's trust. In the scene "Sending the Intelligence," the cunning and treacherous enemy Seatiger Mountain and the bandits devised a secret plan to test Yang Zhirong. However, Yang Zhirong, with a revolutionary soldier's high alertness and keen eyesight, saw through the enemy's plot at a glance, using "turning the enemy's plot against them," not only making Seatiger Mountain's plot fail but also seizing the opportunity to send the intelligence out.

During the days Yang Zhirong stayed in the tiger's den, he was always full of revolutionary enthusiasm, always suppressing the enemy with revolutionary righteousness. Although he left his comrades and was alone, he always felt that he had "millions of class brothers" by his side, had the great Party, had the "morning sun" that "melts the ice and snow" in his heart, and had the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "The Party's words are a guarantee of victory, the Party's words are the truth that shines forever." From here, we not only see Yang Zhirong's loyalty to the Party and his boundless love for Chairman Mao but also powerfully prove that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, most intelligent, most steadfast, most combat-ready, most fearless of hardship and death. They are invincible and conquer all.

After Yang Zhirong devised a plan to send the intelligence down the mountain, he was about to successfully reunite with the "Hundred Chicken Banquet." However, the captured Lu Ping suddenly escaped and came to the Tiger Hall. This was a great threat to Yang Zhirong! If Yang Zhirong made the slightest mistake or showed the slightest panic, not only would his life be in danger but it would also affect the entire military operation of our side. At this critical moment, Yang Zhirong remained calm and composed, using his unique wisdom, calmness, bravery, and revolutionary righteousness to suppress Lu Ping, displaying Yang Zhirong's heroic spirit! Finally, Yang Zhirong got Seatiger Mountain and the bandits drunk, and the pursuit squad took the opportunity to enter and reunite at the Tiger Hall, annihilating this nest of "blood-debted and heinous" bandits, and the Party and Chairman Mao's sunlight shone into this deep valley.

Yang Zhirong's heroic image was gradually established in the process of overcoming one difficulty after another. He ascended the socialist literary stage with a new appearance, providing a model for our country's revolutionary modern Peking opera in portraying heroic figures.

Socialist literature is a completely new revolutionary literature. It aims to establish the newness of socialism and the uniqueness of the proletariat, to portray the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, praising the proletariat, portraying the proletariat's heroes, and making the proletariat's heroic figures occupy the dominant position in literary works is the fundamental line that distinguishes proletarian literature from all exploiting class literature. The revolutionary Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has withstood the criticism, suppression, and attacks of the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, such as Zhou Yang, Lin Mohan, and Tan Han, as well as the bourgeois artistic "authorities," shattered the old Peking opera's rules and regulations, and created for us a brilliant image of a proletarian hero armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is a victory for the reform of Peking opera, a victory for the Cultural Revolution, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought! We believe that under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary literary and artistic workers will definitely create more and better works in the three great revolutionary movements, portraying even greater and more brilliant heroic figures.

At the moment when Seatiger Mountain was holding the "Hundred Chicken Banquet," our pursuit squad arrived in time, annihilating all the bandits and achieving a glorious victory.

专栏：

    编者按：上海革命京剧文工团演出的革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》，经过多次加工修改，精益求精，以崭新的面目又一次和首都广大观众见面了。
    《智取威虎山》是在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中诞生的。自从毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的号召之后，文化战线上的灭资兴无斗争进一步开展起来了。全国革命的戏曲工作者以毛泽东思想为武器，向京剧这个表演帝王将相、才子佳人的最顽固的堡垒开了炮，使它从思想内容到艺术形式，都来了个大革命。京剧《智取威虎山》就是这场攻克京剧堡垒战斗中的硕果之一。
    京剧的革命，触动了剥削阶级文化的根基。那些钻进党内的、窃踞文艺界领导地位的资产阶级代理人，那些封建阶级的遗老遗少，预感到自己行将灭亡的命运。他们在岌岌可危的时刻，进行着最后的挣扎。他们明枪暗箭，对革命现代京剧进行了疯狂的攻击。周扬修正主义集团的副帅林默涵，在幕后经过紧张的策划之后，通过他的娄罗公然在报刊上发表文章诋毁《智取威虎山》这出革命的优秀剧目，妄图借此攻击毛主席的文艺思想。但是他们的阴谋没有得逞。
    在一九六四年全国京剧现代戏观摩演出大会上，《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》等优秀革命现代京剧，受到了广大观众的热烈欢迎。京剧革命化取得了伟大的胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，上海革命京剧文工团的革命同志，以不断革命的精神，不断加工修改《智取威虎山》，使得这出戏无论在思想上和艺术上都有了非常显著的提高。这出戏更加突出地歌颂了毛主席的人民战争思想，更加突出地塑造了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士的英雄形象。在政治内容与艺术形式上也达到了更好的统一。
    革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》的成功，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。上海革命京剧文工团的革命同志们创作演出和加工修改《智取威虎山》的过程，是突出毛泽东思想，坚持活学活用毛主席著作的过程，也是无产阶级文艺路线和资产阶级文艺路线针锋相对地进行斗争的过程。事实证明，只有大破资产阶级思想，才能大立无产阶级思想；只有打倒资产阶级的反动艺术“权威”，无产阶级文艺才能得到进一步发展和繁荣。
    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄形象
    中国人民解放军某部　江宗开
    上海革命京剧文工团演出的革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》，是一出具有高度思想水平和艺术水平的好戏。我们看了，感动得很，振奋得很。
    这个戏的背景是在解放战争初期——一九四六年冬天。它通过我军的一个追剿队，遵照毛主席关于“建立巩固的东北根据地”的指示，深入林海雪原，在牡丹江一带发动群众，消灭盘踞深山的土匪座山雕的故事，塑造了一群闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄人物，其中，又特别突出了侦察排长杨子荣的英雄形象。
    杨子荣是一个在毛泽东思想照耀下成长起来的英雄，是在革命战火中冶炼出来的英雄。他对党、对人民、对革命事业无限热爱、无限忠诚；他立场坚定，爱憎分明，阶级感情十分强烈；他心胸开阔，目光远大，以天下人民的解放为己任；他勇敢无畏，机智沉着，不怕牺牲，有着压倒一切敌人而绝不被敌人所压倒的英雄气概。在他身上处处闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉；处处焕发出高度革命英雄主义的光彩。
    这出戏首先描写了杨子荣对人民深沉而强烈的阶级感情。当追剿队来到林海雪原以后，马上就访贫问苦，扎根串连，把人民的痛苦当作自己的痛苦。在《访贫问苦》一场戏中，杨子荣听完常宝控诉座山雕烧杀掳掠，杀死她祖母、母亲的时候，顿时，一股强烈的阶级感情冲上了这个出身雇农、全家也被地主逼死了的杨子荣的胸口：“小常宝控诉了土匪罪状，字字血，声声泪，激起我仇恨满腔。普天下被压迫的人民都有一本血泪账，要报仇，要伸冤，血债要用血来偿”。他并且解下干粮袋，留给常宝父女，又劝告他们父女暂时转移，以避土匪迫害。
    通过这场戏，生动地展示了在毛泽东思想哺育下的杨子荣那崇高的内心世界，交代了杨子荣的英雄性格的思想基础。杨子荣满怀着为山区人民报仇雪恨，消灭顽匪，巩固后方的决心，通过周详的调查和分析，向团首长少剑波请求把“扮装土匪，打进威虎山”的艰巨任务交给自己。他表示：“共产党员时刻听从党召唤，专拣重担挑在肩”，“明知征途有艰险，越是艰险越向前”，“一颗红心似火焰，化作利剑斩凶顽！”在这里，一个为人民甘愿赴汤蹈火，专拣重担子挑的英雄形象得到了更进一步的揭示。
    杨子荣接受任务以后，离开了自己的首长，离开了自己的战友，“穿林海跨雪原”，“打虎上山”了。虽然是单枪匹马，虽然是身入虎穴，可他“气冲霄汉”，面对那巍峨耸立的群山，表达了这样的豪情壮志：“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展，哪怕是火海刀山也扑上前。恨不得急令飞雪化春水，迎来春天换人间。”观众看到这里，仿佛有一座巍峨耸立的高山屹立在面前，谁不为杨子荣那顶天立地的英雄气概，那颗火辣辣的红心，那种崇高的理想而钦佩，而感动呢！
    “党给我智慧给我胆，千难万险只等闲”。杨子荣一身是胆，甩开大步，朝着白雪皑皑、烟雾蒙蒙的雪原继续前进。
    如果说，打虎上山初步显示了杨子荣的英雄性格，那么当他进入匪窟，来到威虎厅里，则是他英雄性格的更进一步的升华。他在那狡诈的敌人面前，昂首傲立，从容不迫；他在那凶残的狼群当中，机智灵活，应付裕如。座山雕在盘问他的身份和地图的来历的时候，杨子荣面对敌人，镇定自若，对答如流，取得了敌人的信任。在《计送情报》一场戏中，阴险狡猾的敌人座山雕和匪徒们，又定下密计，考验杨子荣。但是，杨子荣以一个革命战士高度的警觉，敏锐的目光，一眼看穿了敌人的阴谋，来了个“将计就计”，不仅使座山雕的阴谋诡计破产，而且还乘机将情报送出去了。
    在杨子荣身居龙潭虎穴的日子里，他始终充满了革命的豪情，总是以革命的正气绝对压倒敌人。他虽然离开了战友，只身单影，但始终感到身旁有“千百万阶级弟兄”，有伟大的党，胸中有“抗严寒化冰雪”的“朝阳”，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他说：“党的话句句是胜利保障，党的话是真理永放光芒。”从这里，我们不仅看到杨子荣对党赤胆忠心，对毛主席无比热爱，而且，还有力地证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，最机智，最坚定，最有战斗力，最不怕苦，最不怕死，他们所向无敌，战无不胜。
    杨子荣定计将情报送下山之后，眼看就要顺利地会师“百鸡宴”了。但是，为我方俘虏的栾平突然跑掉，来到了威虎厅。这对杨子荣是一个多么大的威胁呵！如果杨子荣稍有失策，稍有慌神，那么，不仅生命危在旦夕，而且还会影响我方整个军事行动。在这样紧要的关头，杨子荣脸不改色心不跳，以特有的机智、沉着、勇敢和革命正气压住了栾平，显示了杨子荣的英雄本色！最后，杨子荣把座山雕等匪徒们灌得酩酊大醉，追剿队乘机而入，会师威虎厅，把这窝“血债累累罪滔天”的匪徒们一举消灭了，党和毛主席的阳光照进了这深山幽谷。
    杨子荣的英雄形象正是在战胜这样一个又一个困难的过程中，逐步树立起来的。他以崭新的面貌登上了社会主义的文艺舞台，为我国革命现代京剧在塑造英雄形象上提供了一个样板。
    社会主义的文艺，是一种完全崭新的革命文艺，它就是要标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，就是要塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵的英雄形象。因此，歌颂无产阶级，塑造无产阶级的英雄，让无产阶级的英雄人物在文艺作品中居于统治地位，是区分无产阶级文艺和一切剥削阶级文艺的根本界线。革命京剧《智取威虎山》，顶住了周扬、林默涵、田汉等党内走资本主义道路的当权派以及资产阶级艺术“权威”的责难、压制和打击，砸碎了旧京剧的条条框框，为我们塑造了一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级英雄人物的光辉形象。这是京剧改革的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利！我们相信，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，革命的文艺工作者一定会在三大革命运动中，创作出更多更好的作品，塑造出更高大更光辉的英雄形象。（附图片）
    在座山雕大张“百鸡宴”的时刻，我追剿队及时赶到，全歼众匪，取得辉煌胜利。
