A group of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Kunming military region share their experiences

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, October 14th -- A group of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Kunming military region shared their experiences while studying Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on advancing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They discussed the profound significance of studying the "Three Articles" ("In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Qu Yuan and the Will to Overcome"). They said, "The Three Articles" are treasures of the revolution. The more you study them, the clearer your mind and eyes become, and the stronger your revolutionary will becomes.

Platoon leader Bai Zhicheng (Yi ethnic group) said: Comrade Lin Biao calls on us to definitely study the "Three Articles" well. This really hits the mark. Emphasizing the study of the "Three Articles" is grasping the fundamental issue of transforming worldviews. This is the most important and fundamental issue for revolutionary soldiers. Once you genuinely establish a proletarian worldview, you can wholeheartedly serve the people, dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire, and fear no enemy.

Chairman Mao said, "To struggle is to make sacrifices, and deaths are common occurrences. To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." Repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings, I feel that serving the people requires bravely fighting. In the border areas, a few years ago, I fought several battles. Once, we counterattacked a group of bandits and special agents. I was at the forefront. When we were about to catch up with the enemy, my gun had only one bullet left. What should I do? I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and charged forward without hesitation. I thought, even without bullets, I could use my bayonet to stab, my gunstock to smash, and my teeth to bite, to annihilate the enemy and not let them escape. Thus, I and my entire platoon annihilated this group of enemies.

Soldier Bi Fengchang (Yi ethnic group) said: The "Three Articles" are short, and seem easy to understand at first glance, but the principles are as deep as the Eastern Sea. They must be studied and practiced repeatedly, without interruption. Last August, during a live-fire exercise, I was injured all over my body and my mouth swelled so much that I couldn't eat. At that time, I took out "Serve the People" and studied it repeatedly. Chairman Mao's book is more effective than painkillers. Injections can only stop physical pain, but Mao Zedong Thought makes my willpower stronger and helps me overcome the pain completely. A few days later, the doctor told me that my left eye could not be saved. Upon hearing this news, my mind was suddenly in chaos. At that moment, Chairman Mao's teachings came to my mind. I thought: Although I am injured and disabled, as long as I have no selfishness, I can still serve the people. As soon as my injuries improved slightly, I saw that the medical staff were very busy, so I endured the pain to help them clean the place, carry urine bottles, pour water, and feed medicine to the seriously ill. Countless facts have made me deeply realize that the "Three Articles" are the fundamental fundamentals. They must be studied repeatedly, used continuously, and never left for a moment.

Former guidance officer of the Bake ethnic work team, Zhang Youfu, said: The "Three Articles" discuss the proletarian worldview. In our revolution, big and small matters all cannot be separated from this fundamental issue. We must work hard on the "use" aspect and not be clever. We must be honest and only then can we study the "Three Articles" well. I have worked in the border areas for ten years and deeply feel this point. Our Bake Township is adjacent to the border line, with twelve villages, and is a remote mountainous area. In the early days of liberation, life here was very hard, and the struggle was very complicated. Can we persist in doing a lifetime of revolution here? With this question in mind, I studied the "Three Articles." It was Comrade Zhang Side who inspired me to be completely and thoroughly for the people; it was Comrade Norman Bethune who inspired me to be selfless and dedicated to others; it was the old fool who inspired me to fear neither heaven nor earth and to fight to the death in revolution. With the thought of serving the people, I broke through numerous obstacles, propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the people, and educated the people of Bake Township to get rid of the shackles of feudal superstition and overcome the attacks of class enemies. Then, I used Mao Zedong Thought to educate the Lisu people to change their backward appearance, break old habits and establish new ones, so that the production of the entire township developed continuously, from relying on state relief grain to selling tens of thousands or even tens of thousands of surplus grain to the state every year. Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are very timely. I will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, do a lifetime of revolution, study the "Three Articles" for a lifetime, and resolutely turn the Bake work team and Bake Township into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    世界观的改造是最重要最根本的问题
    干一辈子革命学一辈子“老三篇”
    昆明部队一批学习毛主席著作积极分子畅谈体会
    据新华社昆明十四日电　中国人民解放军昆明部队一批学习毛主席著作积极分子，在学习林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的指示时，根据自己的切身体会，畅谈了学习“老三篇”（《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》）的重大意义。他们说：“老三篇”是革命的宝，越学心越明眼越亮，革命意志越坚强。
    班长白志成（傣族）说：林彪同志号召我们一定学好“老三篇”，这真是说到了我们的心坎上。强调学好“老三篇”，这是抓住了改造世界观这个根本。这是革命战士最重要、最根本的问题。真正树立了无产阶级世界观，就能全心全意为人民服务，就能做到刀山敢上，火海敢闯，什么敌人也不怕。
    毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。”“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。反复学习毛主席这些教导，我觉得为人民服务就要勇敢地去斗争。在边疆，前几年我打过几次仗。有一次，我们反击一股匪特，我冲在前面，当快追上敌人的时候，枪里只剩一发子弹了，怎么办？我想到毛主席的教导，就不顾一切地冲上去。我想，没有子弹，用刺刀刺，枪托砸，用牙齿咬，也能把敌人消灭，绝不能叫敌人跑掉。于是，我和全班同志一起全歼了这股敌人。
    战士毕凤昌（彝族）说：“老三篇”文章短，看起来一读就懂，其实道理比东海还深，必须反复学习，反复实践，永不间断。去年八月我在一次实战训练中，全身受伤几十处，口腔肿得吃不下饭。这时，我拿出《为人民服务》反复学习，毛主席的书比止痛药灵验得多，针水只能止住肉体的疼痛，毛泽东思想使我意志更坚强，彻底战胜伤痛。过几天，医生又告诉我，说我的左眼无法挽救了，听到这一消息，我心里顿时乱哄哄的。这时，毛主席的教导涌上心头，我想：我虽然受伤残废了，只要毫无自私自利之心，还是能为人民服务的。伤势稍好，我看医务人员很忙，我就忍着疼痛帮她们打扫卫生，给重病号提尿壶、倒水、喂药。无数事实，使我深深体会到：“老三篇”是根本的根本，必须反复学，不断用，一刻也不能离开。
    蚌孔民族工作队前指导员张友福说：“老三篇”讲的是无产阶级的世界观，我们干革命，大事小事都离不开这个根本问题，非在“用”字上狠下功夫不可，不能耍“小聪明”，要老老实实，有了老实态度才能学好“老三篇”。我在边疆工作十年深切地体会到这一点。我们蚌孔乡紧靠国境线，有十二个寨子，是一个偏僻的山区。解放初期，这里生活很艰苦，斗争很复杂。能长期坚持在这里干一辈子革命吗？带着这个问题，我学习了“老三篇”。是张思德同志鼓舞了我“完全”“彻底”为人民；是白求恩同志鼓舞了我毫不利己专门利人；是老愚公鼓舞了我天不怕，地不怕，拚死拚活干革命。有了为人民服务的思想，我就冲破了重重阻力，在群众中宣传毛泽东思想，教育蚌孔人民摆脱封建迷信的枷锁，战胜阶级敌人的进攻。接着，又用毛泽东思想教育傈僳族人民改变落后面貌，破旧立新，使全乡生产不断发展，由吃国家救济粮，变成每年向国家卖几万斤甚至十几万斤余粮。林彪同志的指示太及时了，我一定遵照林彪同志的指示，干一辈子革命，学一辈子“老三篇”，坚决把蚌孔工作队和蚌孔乡办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
