	This is where the U.S. Marines meet their doom!
	The U.S. magazine *Newsweek* on October 10 published a report admitting that a battalion of U.S. Marines recently invaded a hill south of the demilitarized zone and fell into a trap set by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, suffering a crushing defeat.

	The October 10 issue of *Newsweek* published a report from its correspondent who followed the invading U.S. Marines in South Vietnam. The report described the U.S. Marines' recent humiliation in the area south of the demilitarized zone, where they were ambushed by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army.

	The report said that on the morning of September 27, the third battalion of the fourth Marine Regiment was advancing towards "Mount 400" on the "Rocky Ridge" south of the demilitarized zone. Just on a small path leading to this hill, "a Marine company had recently suffered sixty percent casualties in combat." When the third battalion reached "Mount 400," they immediately fell into a trap set by the Liberation Army. "The guide tripped over a bamboo stick and fell. This triggered a booby trap three yards behind him and set off several hand grenades hanging from the tree branches. Four people were injured. Suddenly, a burst of machine-gun fire came from an unseen direction." Then came the Marines' desperate calls for "Medics!"

	Following this, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army's mortars opened fire. The reporter wrote: "Mortar shells exploded around us. I couldn't move; I was breathless." "A Marine didn't have time to jump into a foxhole, and his head was blown off."

	When the U.S. Marines retreated, they were ambushed again by the Liberation Army. "Two machine guns mowed us down." The Liberation Army "almost surrounded us. I had a terrible feeling that I would never see my family again."

	"11:05 a.m. — The second mortar barrage came. After nine terrifying mortar shells exploded, there were cries of 'Medics!' again."

	"12:15 p.m. — ... Many wounded Marines were waiting in the scorching sun for help." "They had been without water and food for twenty-four hours."

	At 3 p.m., "wounded Marines were still being brought in..." By the next day, "8:20 a.m. — The fourth mortar barrage came. I don't know how many shells there were."

	"9 a.m. — Shells flew over our heads. A 105mm shell from the U.S. Marines fell short and hit the outskirts of the command post. Five more were injured."

	"10:10 a.m. — The fifth mortar barrage began." In the afternoon, "1:55 p.m. — This was the most intense barrage." The Liberation Army's "artillery fire surrounded us on all sides. Then came the order, 'Quick! All medics forward!' The K Company was shelled again."

	Not long ago, the invading U.S. Marines ventured into the area south of the demilitarized zone and were met with a crushing defeat by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army. This is the humiliating scene after the U.S. Marines' defeat.

	U.S. Marine helicopters attempted to wreak havoc but were shot down by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army.

    这里是美军的葬身之地！
    美国《新闻周刊》十日发表一篇报道承认：侵越美军的一营海军陆战队最近窜犯非军事区南面的一个山头，结果陷入了南越解放军布下的天罗地网，遭到迎头痛击，溃不成军。
    十日出版的美国《新闻周刊》发表了该刊跟随侵越美军的记者从南越发回的一篇报道，记述美军最近在非军事区以南地区遭到南越解放武装力量迎头痛击时的狼狈相。
    报道说，侵越美军第四海军陆战团第三营九月二十七日早晨正在开向非军事区南面的
  “石堆山岭”上的“四○○山头”。就在通向这个山头的一条小路上，不久前，“美国陆战队一个连在作战中死伤达百分之六十。”当美军第三营到达“四○○山头”时，他们立即陷入了解放武装力量布下的天罗地网。“领路的人踩着一根竹竿摔了一跤。这一来却扳响了在他后面三码的撞雷，同时还牵响了从树枝吊下来的几颗手榴弹。有四人伤亡。突然间，一阵机关枪扫过来。也看不见来自那个方向。”接着是美军的“阵阵呼唤‘救护员！’的叫声。”
    随后，南越解放军的迫击炮打响了。记者写道：“迫击炮弹在我们周围爆开。我不能动，呼吸困难。”“一名陆战兵来不及跳到洞里，他的头被炸断一半。”
    当美军退回来的时候，他们又中了解放武装力量的伏击。“两挺机关枪向我们密集扫射。”解放武装力量“现在几乎把我们包围起来了。我有一种可怕的感觉，我觉得我再也不会和家人见面了。”
    “十一时零五分——（解放武装力量）第二次迫击炮袭击又来了。随着九响可怕的迫击炮弹爆炸之后，又是一阵阵惨叫‘救护员’之声。”
    “中午十二时十五分——……不少的美军伤兵在烈日下等着人来救伤”。“他们断水和粮已二十四小时了”。
    下午三时，美军“伤兵还是不断的送来……”到了翌日“八时二十分——第四次迫击炮进袭又来了。多少发，我也数不清。”
    “九时——炮弹从我们头上飞过。美军的一枚一○五毫米炮弹，竟然未到达射程便落了下来，击中了（美军）指挥站的外围。又有五人受伤。”
      “十时十分——第五次迫击炮袭击又开始了。”下午，“一时五十五分——这是空前猛烈的一次”。解放军的“炮火四面包围着我们。接着又是‘快！一切医务员上前！’的号令。（美军）K连又被炮轰了。”　（新华社）（附图片）
    不久以前，侵越美军窜犯非军事区以南的地区，遭到南越解放军的迎头痛击。这是美军惨败后的狼狈相。
    美军直升飞机企图逞凶，也被南越解放军击落下来。
