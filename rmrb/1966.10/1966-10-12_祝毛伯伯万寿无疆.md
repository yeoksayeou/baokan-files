From the upper reaches to the lower reaches of Laos,
The people's hearts bloom with fresh flowers,
These flowers full of friendship,
Let me offer them to you,
Great Chairman Mao.

We study your revolutionary truths,
Unceasingly reform our thoughts,
Diligently temper ourselves,
And forever march forward according to your instructions.

May Chairman Mao's ideals be realized,
Long live Chairman Mao forever!

    从上寮到下寮，
    人民心中盛开的鲜花，

    愿毛伯伯理想实现，
    祝毛伯伯万寿无疆！
