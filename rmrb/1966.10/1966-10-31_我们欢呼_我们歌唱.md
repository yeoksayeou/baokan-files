	"We have successfully launched a nuclear missile test!" A thunderous roar shattered the night sky, echoing throughout the entire campus. Students who were writing big-character posters immediately put down their pens, and those who were sleeping quickly got up. Everyone was too excited to contain their joy, rushing out the door, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

	As soon as the first broadcast ended, cheers and the sound of drums and gongs filled the air. Students from Nanjing who had come to Beijing for revolutionary activities rushed back to their lodgings and quickly wrote many big-character posters. They jumped and danced, saying, "We came from thousands of miles away to be near Chairman Mao, and every night we are so excited that we can't sleep. Today, we have encountered such a joyous event, how can we not cheer and sing?" Vietnamese students studying at the university were also inspired by the news. They saw this great victory as their own and were as happy as their Chinese classmates. They immediately wrote big-character posters and banners in Chinese, saying, "Heartily congratulate China on the successful launch of nuclear missiles."

	On the square, crowds quickly gathered, beating drums, waving red flags, and holding high portraits of our beloved leader Chairman Mao, singing and dancing as they marched in celebration. Students who had just arrived from Shenyang, fresh off the train, heard this exhilarating news. Without a moment's rest from their journey, they dropped their bags and immediately joined the marching crowd.

	Many students had already run to the school gate and the streets, waiting for the extra edition of the People's Daily. People huddled together, discussing the news. A Red Guard warrior said, "This nuclear missile will hit the heads of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists!" As he spoke, he mimicked Johnson getting hit, making everyone laugh. A foreign student also stood in the crowd, eagerly waiting for the extra edition. Dressed in ordinary Chinese clothes, with a Mao Zedong badge shining on his chest, he excitedly grabbed the hand of a Red Guard warrior, saying, "I heard it! I heard the broadcast!" He raised his right hand, extending his index finger, gesturing, "This achievement belongs to the Party and Chairman Mao. China went from having no missiles to having missiles. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! I feel that the happiest people in the world are those who have Mao Zedong Thought in their minds. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a cultural revolution of global significance. I am one hundred percent sure that China will never change color. With Mao Zedong Thought and seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, China will never change color."

	When the extra edition of the People's Daily arrived, the entire campus became a sea of joy, and the sky echoed with cheers and songs. Everyone's hearts had already flown to Zhongnanhai, and the song "The Ship Sails on with the Helmsman" filled the night sky.

	The east gradually brightened, and the sun rose from the horizon. Under a sea of red flags, a grand procession marched towards Zhongnanhai to report the good news. The sun rose higher and higher, and the entire city of Beijing was bathed in golden sunlight.

    我们欢呼　我们歌唱
    中国人民大学两个红卫兵
    “我国发射导弹核武器试验成功了！”
    一声春雷划破了夜空，震荡在整个校园。正在写大字报的同学，立即放下笔，睡下的同学，也赶忙爬了起来，大家都按捺不住内心的激动，飞步跑出门外，第一句就高喊：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    第一遍广播刚一结束，欢呼声，锣鼓声，便在四处响了起来。南京来京串连的同学，飞快地跑回住处，一连气就写出好多张大字报。他们跳啊，蹦啊，高兴地说：“我们从几千里外来到毛主席身边，每天兴奋得夜里都睡不着觉，今天又遇上了这样的大喜事，我们怎么能不欢呼，不歌唱呢！”在校的越南留学生，也为这个喜讯所鼓舞，他们把这个伟大胜利看作是自己的胜利，像中国同学一样高兴。他们立刻写出了“热烈祝贺中国发射导弹核武器试验成功”的中文大标语和大字报。
    广场上，立刻集合起群众队伍，敲着锣鼓，举着红旗，高举着敬爱的领袖毛主席的画像，载歌载舞，去游行欢庆。从沈阳来京串连的同学刚下火车，就听到这振奋人心的消息，他们顾不上旅途的疲劳，放下背包，马上就参加了游行的队伍。
    不少同学早就跑到校门口和马路上，等待着《人民日报》的号外。人们簇拥着，谈论着。一位红卫兵战士说：“这颗导弹核武器可击中了美帝和苏修的脑袋！”他一边说着，一边表演约翰逊挨打的丑态，逗得大家都笑了起来。一个外国留学生也站在人群中，焦急地等待号外，他和平常一样，仍是一身普通的中国衣服，一枚毛主席像纪念章在他胸前闪闪发光。他激动地攥着一位红卫兵战士的手说：“我听到了，我听到广播了！”他抬起右手，伸出食指，比划着说：“这个成绩归于党和毛主席。中国从没有导弹到有了导弹，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我感到世界上最幸福的人，就是脑子里有毛泽东思想的人。中国人民的文化大革命，是有全世界意义的文化大革命。我百分之百地相信中国永远不会变色，有了毛泽东思想，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，中国就永远不会变色。”
    《人民日报》号外送到时，整个校园都变成了欢乐的海洋，整个天空都回响着欢呼和歌唱，人们的心早就飞到了中南海，《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声响彻夜空。
    东方渐渐地亮了，朝阳从大地上升起。在一片红旗之下，大队人马浩浩荡荡地奔向中南海去报喜。太阳越升越高，整个北京城都沐浴在金色的阳光中。
