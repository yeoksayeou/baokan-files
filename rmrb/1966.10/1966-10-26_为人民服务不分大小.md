Title: Service to the People Knows No Big or Small

There is a distinction between big and small transactions, but serving the people knows no such distinction. In the past, I did not fully understand this, so in my work, I only wanted to handle big transactions and was reluctant to deal with small ones. Once, a comrade from a forestry station wanted to buy a batch of wool sweaters. I thought: completing this big transaction would be a significant achievement. We inquired everywhere and found out that the Qiangxin Supply and Marketing Cooperative had some wool yarn in stock, so we arranged for it to be transported back and sent to the wool factory for processing. After completing this transaction, we were all very pleased.

For everyday items that the masses frequently need, I thought of them as small transactions, so I was not very enthusiastic about managing them. For example, many customers wanted to buy black thread, but we only had white thread. Although some comrades suggested processing some, I was too lazy to do it. Because of this preference for big transactions and disdain for small ones, the number of small items we managed decreased, the masses' complaints increased, and our sales plan became increasingly difficult to complete.

Why did this situation arise? Firstly, it was due to my own ideological issues. Chairman Mao said, "Our army is a people's army. It is an army for the complete liberation of the people. It is an army that is thoroughly for the people's interests." However, I acted from a selfish perspective, thinking that handling big transactions would yield quick results, complete tasks, and earn praise from leaders; managing small items was troublesome, with little profit, and no benefits. What else could this be if not an ideological issue? Additionally, there was a problem with my approach. Mainly, I did not fully understand the dialectical relationship between big and small transactions under certain conditions. Small transactions might seem to yield little profit, but if sold in large quantities, they could become big transactions; big transactions might seem to yield high profits, but with fewer transactions, they could eventually become small transactions.

After gaining this understanding, in my work, I pay attention to both big and small transactions. Previously, we sold wool by the pound, then by the half-pound, and now we even sell by the yard. With the right mindset, the number of small items we manage has increased, and we have lowered the retail starting point for more than twenty items, greatly convenience the masses. Our sales volume has also increased compared to before, and business is more lively.

Through this experience, I have come to understand a profound truth: serving the people requires thinking big and starting small. By thinking big, I mean always considering the interests of the people, the socialist revolution and construction, and the world revolution, and linking every small matter to the revolutionary cause. This way, when doing small things, one has abundant revolutionary enthusiasm. By starting small, I mean serving the people is not just about talking; it is about doing small things like selling needles and thread conscientiously and thoroughly, and contributing to the revolution through these small things.

### 为人民服务不分大小

    为人民服务不分大小
    山西襄垣县红旗商场售货员　张小棠
    买卖有大小之分，为人民服务可没有大小之别。过去我对这一点认识不够，所以在工作中，只愿意做大生意，不愿意做小买卖。有一次，林场有位同志要买一批毛背心，我想：做了这笔大生意，能顶大事。我们四处打听，了解到强新供销社存压着一些毛线，就从那里把毛线调济回来，并送到毛织厂去加工。这笔生意做成以后，我们都很高兴。
    对群众经常需要的日用品，由于我思想上认为是小买卖，经营就不是那样热心。比如许多顾客要买黑线，我们只有白线，尽管有的同志建议加工一部分，我也懒得去做。由于存在着喜大厌小思想，所以，经营的小商品越来越少，群众意见越来越多，销售计划也越来越完不成。
    为什么会造成这种情况呢？首先是自己思想意识上的问题。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”而自己从个人主义出发，认为抓大生意，见效快，能完成任务，能受到领导表扬；经营小商品，零零乱乱，麻烦多，卖钱少，没啥油水。这不是思想意识问题是什么？同时，也有思想方法上的问题。主要是自己对大小买卖在一定条件下互相转化的辩证关系认识不够。小买卖看来卖的钱少，但卖得多了就变成了大生意；大生意看来卖的钱多，但交易次数少，长久没有交易，也就成了小买卖了。
    认识提高了以后，我在工作中，既重视抓大的，也重视抓小的。以前我们的毛线是论斤卖，后来变成了论两卖，现在就是有人买几尺我们也卖。思想对了，经营的小商品也多了，还降低了二十多种商品的零售起点，大大方便了群众。销售额也比以前上升，买卖更加活跃了。
    通过这一活的教训，使我明确了一个大道理：为人民服务，必须从大处着想，小处着手。所谓大处着想，就是要时时刻刻想到全国人民，想到社会主义革命和社会主义建设，想到世界革命，把每一件小事和革命大事紧紧联系在一起。这样，干起小事来，就有充沛的革命干劲。所谓从小处着手，就是为人民服务，不能只在口头上喊，必须把卖针卖线等平凡的小事情，扎扎实实地做好，通过做好这些小事，为革命贡献力量。
