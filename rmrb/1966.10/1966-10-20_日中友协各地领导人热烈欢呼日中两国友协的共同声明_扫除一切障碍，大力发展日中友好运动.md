Local leaders and masses of the Japan-China Friendship Association in various parts of Japan have been enthusiastically hailing the joint statement signed in Beijing on October 12 by the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation and the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation.

They pointed out that under the brilliant guidance of this joint statement, the friendship movement between the peoples of the two countries will certainly overcome the obstacles created by U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism and their various followers, and will forge ahead to achieve new and greater developments.

Zenguichi Koya, a standing director of the Japan-China Friendship Association and chairman of the Shimonoseki branch of the Yamaguchi Prefecture association, said: "We wholeheartedly support this statement and are determined to immediately carry out its spirit in our practical work." He said: "This joint statement is a new pledge to further develop the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries and to wage a resolute struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism. This statement is a great contribution to the peace cause of the Asian peoples and the liberation cause of the peoples of all countries. We are firmly convinced that it will become the foundation for the further development of the Japan-China friendship movement."

He said: "As the joint statement points out, in Japan, various reactionary forces have been slandering and defaming the Japan-China friendship movement, which is not only groundless but also an attempt to sabotage the Japan-China friendship movement from within. We will resolutely eliminate all such sabotage and obstacles and, on a broader scale, develop the Japan-China friendship movement, making it achieve even greater development."

Masao Shimada, a standing director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said: "The joint statement of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the China-Japan Friendship Association is a guideline for the development of the friendship movement between the two countries in the future and a serious blow to those engaged in anti-China and splittist activities. The joint statement's strong support for the Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Festival will certainly enhance the fighting spirit and confidence of Japanese youth."

Kiezo Saito, a standing director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, expressed his determination to promote the Japan-China friendship movement in accordance with the principles of the joint statement. He said: "Although there are still various obstacles in the Japan-China friendship movement at present, we will certainly make it advance in the correct direction."

Kazuo Fujisawa, a director of the Fukuoka Prefecture Federation and chairman of the Fukuoka City branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said: "Recently, from the preparations for the China Economic and Trade Exhibition, from the preparations for the Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Festival, we have seen with great indignation the various sabotage and obstruction activities of a small group of people who oppose Japan-China friendship, and we have waged a resolute struggle against them. Just as this China Exhibition has achieved great success, no matter how much these people try to sabotage and obstruct, the Japan-China friendship movement will certainly advance, and they will surely suffer a shameful failure and reap the fruits of their own actions."

A member of the Japan-China Friendship Association who is a teacher, Eiken Taruhisa, said: "This joint statement reflects the historical trend of the peoples of the two countries desiring friendship. All reactionaries and anti-China elements who attempt to obstruct this trend will inevitably meet with failure."

    日中友协各地领导人热烈欢呼日中两国友协的共同声明
    扫除一切障碍，大力发展日中友好运动
    据新华社十八日讯　东京消息：日本各地日中友好协会领导人和群众，连日来热烈欢呼十月十二日在北京签字的日本中国友好协会代表团和中国日本友好协会代表团的共同声明。
    他们纷纷指出，在这一共同声明的光辉照耀下，日中两国人民的友好运动，必将战胜美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者的阻碍，乘风破浪获得新的、更大的发展。
    日中友好协会常任理事、日中友好协会山口县下关市分会会长古谷庄一郎说：“我们衷心拥护这个声明，并决心立即把声明的精神贯彻到实际工作中去。”他说：“这个共同声明，是进一步发展日中两国人民的战斗友谊，同两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义进行坚决斗争的新的誓言，这个声明，对亚洲人民的和平事业和各国人民的解放事业，是一个巨大的贡献，我们坚信，它定将成为日中友好运动进一步发展的基础。”
    他说：“正如共同声明所指出的，在日本，形形色色的反动势力对日中友好运动的诽谤和中伤，不仅是毫无根据的，而且是企图从内部破坏日中友好运动。这种破坏和阻碍，我们都将坚决清除，并在更加广泛的范围内，发展日中友好运动，使日中友好运动获得更大的发展。”
    日中友好协会常任理事岛田政雄说：“日中友好协会和中日友好协会的共同声明，是今后发展两国友好运动的指针，是对进行反华分裂活动者的一个严重打击。共同声明对日中青年友好大联欢的巨大支持，定会增强日本青年的斗争勇气和信心。”
    日中友好协会常任理事斋藤纪江表示，今后将根据共同声明的准则推进日中友好运动，他说：“尽管现在在日中友好运动中还存在着种种障碍，我们一定能使日中友好运动沿着正确的方向前进。”
    日中友好协会福冈县联合会理事、福冈市分会会长藤泽一雄说：“最近，从中国经济贸易展览会的准备工作中，从日中青年友好大联欢的筹备工作中，我们极其愤慨地目睹了反对日中友好的一小撮人的种种破坏和阻碍活动，并且同他们作了坚决的斗争。正如这次中国展览会所取得的巨大成功一样，不管这一小撮人，如何尽其破坏与阻碍之能事，日中友好运动必将向前发展，而他们则必将遭到可耻的失败，自食其恶果。”
    一位担任教员的日中友好协会会员垂永英彦说：“这一共同声明，反映了日中两国人民要求友好的历史潮流，凡是企图阻碍这一潮流前进的各种反动派、反华分子，都将避免不了遭到失败的命运。”（附图片）
