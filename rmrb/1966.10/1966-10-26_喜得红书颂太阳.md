Even before the opening of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition in Kitakyushu, Japan, many Japanese friends eagerly anticipated obtaining a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at the exhibition.

As soon as the exhibition began, visitors eagerly wrote in the guestbook: "We need 'Quotations from Chairman Mao'!"

Under the strong demand from the broad masses of Japanese friends, the Japanese edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was soon delivered. Upon hearing the news, Japanese friends immediately spread the word, and the good news quickly spread. Everyone rushed to the exhibition to get the precious book. Those who obtained "Quotations from Chairman Mao" were overjoyed, as if they had found a treasure.

Some Japanese friends who assisted with the Chinese exhibition, after receiving this precious book, carried it in their pockets like Chinese staff members, reading it at any time. Some Japanese friends, after obtaining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," eagerly took it out on the train home to read and introduced it to other passengers: "This is the precious book that Chinese Red Guards read."

Long live Chairman Mao!

A viewer from Kokura, who had visited the exhibition four times, felt more and more the greatness of Chairman Mao. He excitedly said: The great leap forward and victories of the Chinese people are the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. On the day he obtained "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he wrote a letter to the Chinese exhibition on a four or five-meter-long paper strip in large red characters. The letter read: "Long live Mao Zedong ten thousand times! Wish you eternal health. The Japanese people have unlimited friendship for the great proletarian state armed with Mao Zedong Thought—the new China. The great revolutionary victory of seven hundred million Chinese people gives us hope and a vision of the future, and it gives us the courage to fight against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and all monsters and demons. Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

Some young people in Yamaguchi Prefecture held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at the closing banquet of the exhibition, turning to the page with Chairman Mao's portrait, and repeatedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Carrying the Precious Book to the Struggle

A housewife recently actively assisted the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe of China in their performances in Fukuoka, Japan. She obtained a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the Chinese performers. When she brought the book home, her daughter immediately took it. The daughter carried this revolutionary treasure with her and participated in the nationwide workers' strike on October 21.

This housewife and several other women had organized a study group a few years ago to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and modern Chinese revolutionary history. This time, most of the women in this study group obtained "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They planned to make this book the focus of their study and prepare to expand their study group. The woman said when talking about her love for Chairman Mao's works: "Chairman Mao's works are profound yet easy to understand, with vivid language, as if they were specially written for us women."

    喜得红书颂太阳
    我们需要《毛主席语录》
    还在中国经济贸易展览会在日本北九州开幕前，许多日本朋友就热切地期待着在展览会上能够得到一本《毛主席语录》。
    展览会一开始，观众们纷纷在留言本上写下他们的要求：“我们需要《毛主席语录》！”
    在广大日本朋友的强烈要求下，日文版的《毛主席语录》不久就运来了。日本朋友们听到这个消息后立即奔走相告，喜讯迅速传开。大家纷纷到展览会来索取宝书，得到《毛主席语录》的人都如获至宝，万分高兴。
    协助中国展览会工作的一些日本朋友，得到这本宝书后，也像中国工作人员一样，把它放在衣袋里，随身携带，随时阅读。有的日本朋友得到了《毛主席语录》后，在回家的电车上，就迫不及待地拿出来翻看，并向其他乘客介绍：“这就是中国红卫兵读的宝书”。
    毛主席万岁！
    一位住在小仓的观众曾经四次参观展览会，他越看越感到毛主席的伟大。他激动地说：中国人民的伟大跃进和胜利，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想的胜利。他在得到《毛主席语录》那一天，在有四五丈长的纸条上，用红色大字给中国展览会写了一封信。信上写道：“毛泽东万万岁！祝您永远健康。日本人民对于用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大无产阶级的国家——新中国寄予无限的友情。七亿中国人民的伟大革命胜利，使我们看到世界的希望和未来，并给予了我们同美帝国主义、现代修正主义及一切牛鬼蛇神进行斗争的勇气。日中两国人民始终不渝的战斗友谊万岁！”
    山口县有的青年在庆祝展览会闭幕的酒会上，把《毛主席语录》拿出来，翻到毛主席像的扉页，高举起来，一再欢呼“毛主席万岁！”
    带着宝书参加斗争
    一位家庭妇女最近曾积极协助中国北京歌舞团在日本福冈的演出，她从中国演员那里得到一本《毛主席语录》。当她把书拿到家以后，马上被她的女儿要去了。她的女儿把这本革命宝书带在身上，参加了十月二十一日全国工人的罢工斗争。
    这位家庭妇女和其他几位妇女在几年前就组织了一个学习小组，学习《毛泽东选集》和中国现代革命史。这次，这个小组的大部分妇女都得到了《毛主席语录》，她们打算把这本书作为学习的重点，并且准备扩大她们的学习小组。这位妇女在谈到她热爱毛主席著作的心情时说：“毛主席的著作深入浅出，语言生动，好像专门给我们妇女写的。”
