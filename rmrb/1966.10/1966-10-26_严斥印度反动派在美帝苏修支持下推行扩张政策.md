Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly denounced the Indian reactionaries' expansionist policy, backed by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, at a banquet hosted by the Pakistani Ambassador for the visit of Pakistani Foreign Minister Pirzada to China. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo attended the banquet upon invitation. Pirzada, Sultan, and Chen Yi all spoke, praising the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on October 25, Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a speech at a banquet hosted by Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan Muhammad Khan for the visit of Pakistani Foreign Minister Sayyid Sharifuddin Pirzada and his wife. Chen Yi strongly condemned the Indian reactionaries for continuing to expand their military and prepare for war with the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, stubbornly pursuing a policy of great power chauvinism and expansionism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The Indian reactionaries are brutally oppressing the Kashmiri people who are fighting for self-determination and are tightening their control over Bhutan, which is striving for independence and autonomy. At the same time, the Indian reactionaries are shouting about the so-called 'collusion' between China and Pakistan, claiming that China is 'threatening' India, and fabricating lies about the Chinese army 'invading' Bhutan. They are trying to sow discord between China and its neighboring countries to achieve their sinister goals." Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the Indian reactionaries are oppressing their people at home and relying on the U.S. imperialists abroad to expand. Their backward actions will not end well.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo attended the banquet upon invitation.

Foreign Minister Pirzada spoke at the banquet, enthusiastically praising the eternal friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China, which helps maintain world peace. He said, "Our visit to China has allowed us to see your great country and great people, and the tremendous progress you have made, which has been very educational for us."

Ambassador Sultan spoke first at the banquet. He said, "Pakistan and China are geographically close and have a long history of friendly relations. The friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China is deep-rooted, and we firmly believe that this friendship will last forever."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech, "In the past few days, we have had very sincere and friendly talks with Foreign Minister Pirzada, deepening our mutual understanding and enhancing the friendship between our two countries. Vice Premier Chen Yi asked Foreign Minister Pirzada to convey the warm greetings of the Chinese people to the fraternal people of Pakistan."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "We are confident that, with our joint efforts, the friendly cooperative relations between China and Pakistan will continue to develop, and the peoples of China and Pakistan will be even more closely united in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism."

Those who attended the banquet upon invitation also included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Hanrong, as well as Zhang Qi, Yu Ligun, Wang Zhen, and others.

    陈毅副总理说，印度反动派残酷迫害争取自决权利的克什米尔人民，加紧控制争取独立自主的不丹。与此同时，印度反动派却大嚷大叫所谓中巴“勾结”，“威胁”印度，编造中国军队“侵入不丹”的谎言，妄图以此挑拨中国同邻国的关系，达到它不可告人的目的。陈毅副总理指出，印度反动派对内血腥镇压人民，对外投靠美帝，进行扩张。它这样倒行逆施是不会有好下场的。
