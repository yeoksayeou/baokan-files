I am the livestock keeper of the production team. In the past, I thought that raising pigs was a dirty and smelly job. For 360 days a year, I had to follow the pigs around, and it seemed like a dead-end job. Moreover, I had many selfish thoughts, so the collective pigs were not raised well. I lost heart and wanted to quit.

After the Party branch secretary discovered my ideological problems, he said to me, "Go and study Chairman Mao's works!" I studied "Qu Fuxian Moves Mountains" and was greatly educated. I asked myself, I am a poor peasant. If we poor and lower-middle peasants do not raise pigs for the collective, will we let the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements do it? We poor and lower-middle peasants must be the backbone of the revolution. Any job will encounter difficulties. If everyone retreats when they encounter difficulties, then who will shoulder the heavy burdens?

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, I understood that I should do a good job as a livestock keeper for the revolution. From then on, whenever I encountered difficulties, I studied Chairman Mao's works.

Some time ago, the second batch of piglets stopped drinking milk soon after they were born, and everyone said they were hard to raise. I took this problem and reread "Qu Fuxian Moves Mountains." Chairman Mao said, "Have the courage to face any sacrifice and overcome every difficulty to win victory." These four sentences inspired me. I thought of various ways to raise the piglets well, such as feeding them carefully, letting them eat little but often, finding feed that the piglets like, and keeping them warm at night. As a result, the piglets gradually became plump. From this, I felt that no matter what job you do, you cannot do without studying Chairman Mao's works.

    为革命敢挑重担
    我是生产队的饲养员。过去我想，养猪这活又脏又臭，一年三百六十天，天天跟着猪屁股转，没出息；加上思想上有许多私心杂念，结果集体的猪养不好，我泄了气，想不干了。
    党支部书记发现我的思想问题以后，对我说：“去请教请教毛主席著作吧！”我学习了《愚公移山》，受到了很大教育。我反问自己，我是一个贫农，我们贫下中农不为集体养猪，难道让地富反坏分子来干？我们贫下中农要做革命的硬骨头。干任何工作都会遇到困难，如果大家都像我这样遇到困难就退却，那么困难的担子由谁来挑呢？
    在毛主席的教导下，我懂得了要为革命做好饲养员的工作。从这以后，我一遇到困难，就学毛主席著作。
    前些时候，第二批小猪出生不久就断了奶，别人都说难养活。我带着这个问题，重读了《愚公移山》。毛主席说“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这四句话鼓舞了我。我就想出种种办法把小猪养好，比如：细心喂养，让小猪少吃多餐，找小猪喜欢吃的饲料，晚上给小猪保温。结果小猪慢慢肥壮起来了。从这点，我体会到，不论做什么工作，不读毛主席著作就不行。
