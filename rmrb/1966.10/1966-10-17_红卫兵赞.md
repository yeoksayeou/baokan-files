The Chinese Cultural Revolution marks the beginning of a new stage in the Chinese socialist revolution, which will have a tremendous impact on the revolutionary movement in Japan. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are excellent. They are breaking the old and establishing the new, striving for the cause of the socialist revolution.

Western countries slander the Chinese Cultural Revolution and defame the Red Guards. This is because China, through the Cultural Revolution, has blocked the path to capitalist restoration. The emergence of the Red Guards in China has shattered their illusions about the possibility of a "peaceful evolution" in China's second generation.

	Iraq	Al Fayaadi

We hail the glorious appearance of the Red Guards. Their brave revolutionary actions have shaken the entire world, making all reactionaries tremble. The young warriors of the Red Guards, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, have made the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only a guarantee of the sacred revolutionary cause in China but also in the world. People are learning from them with respect and following their lead.

	Colombia	Kelaweihao

We see that China has launched the Cultural Revolution. In this revolution, the strength of the Red Guards is the great strength of the masses. They represent the great strength of the people who have been mobilized. I greatly admire their indomitable spirit in the face of the enemy.

	Mexico	Weila

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great movement. The youth of China are participating in the management of the state. This is a good thing.

	Australia	Mulin William

The new generation of Chinese Red Guards is full of enthusiasm for the Cultural Revolution. This revolution is a great one, and it will surely sweep away all the illusions of imperialism.

	Sudan	A technical school teacher

The Chinese Cultural Revolution is excellent. The older generation of revolutionaries has passed the torch of the Long March of revolution to the younger generation, ensuring the presence of revolutionary successors.

	Algeria	An old warrior

    红卫兵赞
    中国文化大革命标志着中国社会主义革命进入一个新阶段，这对日本的革命运动将发生巨大的影响。红卫兵的革命行动很好，他们正在破四旧，立四新，为社会主义革命事业而奋斗。
                                      日本　饭冢昭吉
    西方国家诬蔑中国的文化大革命，诽谤红卫兵，这是因为中国通过文化大革命，堵死了资本主义复辟的道路。中国出现了红卫兵，粉碎了他们对中国第二代可能会“和平演变”的幻想。
                            伊拉克　阿尔·法雅迪
    我们欢呼光荣的红卫兵的出现。他们勇敢的革命行动震撼了整个世界，使地球上一切反动派吓得发抖。用毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的红卫兵年青战士们，使得无产阶级文化大革命成为不仅在中国，而且在全世界继承神圣的革命事业的坚强保证。人们正以尊敬的心情在学他们，并跟随着他们前进。
                                哥伦比亚　克拉维豪
    我们看到中国掀起了文化大革命。在这场革命中，红卫兵的力量就是群众的伟大力量，他们代表着已经动员起来了的人民群众的伟大力量。我十分钦佩他们面对敌人的那种刚毅不拔的气概。
                                        墨西哥　维拉
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命是一个伟大的运动。中国的青年正在参加管理国家。这是一件好事情。
                            澳大利亚　穆林·威廉斯
    中国红卫兵新生一代怀着进行文化大革命的极大热情。这次革命是一次伟大的革命，它必将扫除帝国主义的一切幻想。
                              苏丹　一技术学校教师
    中国文化大革命好极了。老一代革命者已经把革命的长征火炬传给了年青一代，有了革命的接班人。
