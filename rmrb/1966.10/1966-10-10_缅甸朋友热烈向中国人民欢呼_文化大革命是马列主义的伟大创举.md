Burmese peace activist U Tun Tin recently told a New China News Agency correspondent: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a glorious new and great initiative of the Communist Party of China under the leadership and personal guidance of Chairman Mao. It is a new and great initiative in the history of Marxism-Leninism."

He said, "The experience of world revolutionary history has given a great lesson to revolutionaries all over the world. It is not enough for revolutionary forces to merely overthrow the old regime and establish a new one. Without the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there is no reliable guarantee against the restoration of capitalism."

He said, "Real revolutionaries around the world have 'noticed the changes in the Soviet Union, and they have seen with their own eyes how Khrushchev and his followers have betrayed the great cause of socialism.' He said: China, with the support of all genuine Marxist-Leninists in the world, has waged a firm and principled struggle against Khrushchev's modern revisionism, 'and has thus become the true center of world revolution.'"

He said, "The decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution adopted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 8 is indeed, like the great Communist Manifesto, a historic document."

He said, this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will certainly make the People's Republic of China a land of true socialism that will never revert to capitalism—a beacon and center of world revolution. It will be a base for the revolutionary people of the world to wage a heroic struggle against imperialism led by the United States, all reactionaries, and modern revisionism. Launching this great and historic revolution is a victory for the great thought of Mao Zedong.

According to a New China News Agency report from Rangoon, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association U Tin Maung on the afternoon of October 10 at the reception held by the Burma-China Friendship Association to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China.

U Tin Maung said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is a great revolution to prevent the revisionists from attempting to restore capitalism in China; it is also a great revolution to ensure that China can steadfastly and faithfully support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. Therefore, this great revolution has not only won the heartfelt support and enthusiastic backing of the Chinese people, but also the heartfelt support and enthusiastic backing of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, including the Burmese people." U Tin Maung pointed out: "This Cultural Revolution, armed with the invincible spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought, will smash all imperialist aggression, smash all reactionaries who have infiltrated from within, and smash all the plots of the revisionists, ensuring that China will never change color, and thus contribute to the interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world."

U Tin Maung, on behalf of the Burma-China Friendship Association, presented a large red flag to Chairman Mao, on which was written: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

    缅甸朋友热烈向中国人民欢呼
    文化大革命是马列主义的伟大创举
    据新华社仰光电　缅甸和平战士吴吞丁最近向新华社记者发表谈话说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命是光荣的中国共产党在毛主席的领导和亲自指导下的一个新的、伟大的创举，是马克思列宁主义历史上的一个新的、伟大的创举”。
    他说，世界革命历史的经验给予全世界的革命者一个很大的教训。革命力量仅仅推翻旧的政权，建立新的政权是不够的，要是没有无产阶级文化大革命，防止资本主义复辟就没有可靠的保证。
    他说，全世界的真正革命者“注意到了苏联的转变，他们亲眼看到了赫鲁晓夫及其追随者背叛了伟大的社会主义事业。”他说：中国在全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者支持下，同赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义开展了坚定和有原则的斗争，“从而成为名副其实的世界革命的中心”。
    他说：“今年八月八日通过的中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，的确正如伟大的共产党宣言一样，是又一个历史性文件。”
    他说，这场无产阶级文化大革命，定将使中华人民共和国成为保证永远不再回到资本主义的真正的社会主义的国土——世界革命的灯塔和中心，全世界革命人民同以美国为首的帝国主义、一切反动派和现代修正主义进行英勇斗争的根据地。发动这场伟大的具有历史意义的革命，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    据新华社仰光电　缅中友好协会主席信波一日下午在缅中友好协会举行的庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年的招待会上，热情赞扬中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命。
    信波说：由毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命“是为了阻止修正主义者妄想在中国复辟资本主义的大革命；也是保证中国能够坚定地忠实地对世界各国人民的革命斗争给予不断支援的大革命。所以，这场大革命，不仅得到了中国人民的衷心拥护和热烈支持，同样也得到了包括缅甸人民在内的亚非拉和世界人民的衷心拥护和热烈支持。”信波指出：“这场文化大革命，将以毛泽东思想这一威力无穷的精神原子弹把中国人民武装起来，粉碎一切帝国主义的侵略，粉碎钻进内部的一切反动派的破坏，并粉碎一切修正主义者的阴谋，将使中国永不变色，从而为中国人民和世界人民的利益作出贡献。”
    信波代表缅中友好协会向毛主席赠献了一面大红旗，上面写着：“毛主席万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”
