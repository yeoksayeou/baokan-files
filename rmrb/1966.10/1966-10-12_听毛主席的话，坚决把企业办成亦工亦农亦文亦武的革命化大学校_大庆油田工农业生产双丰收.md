The workers and family members of the Daqing Oilfield have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, greatly inspiring people's revolutionary spirit and deepening the revolutionization of thought. This year, in the construction of a new type of mining area that combines industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, they have achieved a double harvest in industrial and agricultural production. From January to September, oil production, oil refining, oilfield drilling, and construction have all reached the highest level since the start of the campaign, with major economic indicators all exceeding the state plan. Compared to the same period last year, crude oil production increased by 26.6 percent, oil refining increased by 82.8 percent, and the number of wells drilled was 1.2 times the total length drilled last year. Agricultural production also presents a thriving scene of harvest, with grain production expected to increase significantly compared to last year.

The development of industrial and agricultural production in the Daqing Oilfield is a victory of Chairman Mao's brilliant idea that all sectors should be turned into revolutionary schools that are also industrial, agricultural, cultural, and military. It demonstrates with irrefutable facts the unparalleled superiority of building a new type of mining area that combines industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, guided by Mao Zedong Thought. It not only greatly promotes the revolutionization of people's thoughts, promotes the gradual narrowing of the gaps between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and manual and mental labor, but also facilitates the unified planning of industry and agriculture and the unified allocation of manpower and material resources, achieving mutual promotion between industry and agriculture and a leap in productivity.

In the early days of oilfield development, the workers and family members of Daqing, following Chairman Mao's instructions, not only rapidly and at a high level developed a world-class oilfield but also used their own hardworking hands to reclaim tens of thousands of acres of wasteland. Every year, workers not only work in the factories but also participate in agricultural labor; family members, with agriculture as their main focus, also participate in industrial labor. Workers and family members advance together on the revolutionary path. Over the years, both industrial and agricultural production have achieved outstanding results.

This year, the workers of Daqing have actively participated in the oilfield's agricultural and sideline production according to the plan. They participated in spring plowing, summer weeding, and wheat harvesting. They leveled and plowed more than 50,000 acres of land for the family production teams, dug dozens of wells, and excavated a 52-kilometer-long flood control and drainage canal, benefiting more than 100,000 acres of land with irrigation and drainage. They also trained many tractor drivers for the family production teams. By the end of August, the workers had completed a total of 170,000 agricultural labor days. They can use tools to work in the factories and use hoes to farm the land. Many people have mastered various farming skills. With the support of industry, the agricultural and sideline production in Daqing has now been largely mechanized, and the production level is continuously improving. This year, the 100,000 acres of wheat planted by the family members and workers of Daqing have been harvested, with an average yield per acre increasing by more than 40 percent compared to last year. The corn, soybeans, and other field crops are about to be harvested, with yields also expected to increase significantly compared to last year. Currently, family members and workers are busy fertilizing, plowing the land, and applying fertilizer for next year's production.

While raising agricultural production to the sky, the family members of Daqing also implement the policy of farming during busy agricultural seasons and working in industry during slack periods, actively participating in auxiliary labor in industry. They set up factories, repair roads, open shops, and provide services on the construction sites. Many family members have also mastered some modern production technologies. This year, family members have completed a total of 400,000 industrial labor days, contributing to the construction of the oilfield.

The great achievements in industrial and agricultural production and construction in the oilfield this year are the result of the workers and family members of Daqing studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, seriously implementing the Sixteen Points, and promoting production while carrying out the revolution. This year, the industrial production tasks in the Daqing Oilfield are heavier than in previous years. However, they have fought the production battle as a political battle, fully relying on the masses, promoting worker-designed projects, and conducting scientific research, thus overcoming one difficulty after another and achieving one victory after another in production. In agriculture, family members have drawn endless strength from Chairman Mao's works through repeated study of articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They have overcome spring droughts and pestilences. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have taken the fields as battlefields and hoes as weapons, greatly strengthening the field management of crops. All field crops have been fertilized twice and have achieved three weeding and three tilling, securing a good harvest in agriculture.

    听毛主席的话，坚决把企业办成亦工亦农亦文亦武的革命化大学校
    大庆油田工农业生产双丰收
    新华社十一日讯　大庆油田的广大职工和家属，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，大大激发了人们的革命精神，加深了人的思想革命化，今年以来在建设工农结合城乡结合的新型矿区中，取得了工农业生产双丰收。一到九月，原油生产、原油炼制、油田钻井和建设等方面都出现了会战以来的最高水平，主要经济指标都超额完成了国家计划。与去年同期比较，原油产量增长了百分之二十六点六，原油加工增长了百分之八十二点八，钻井数量相当于去年全年总进尺的一点二倍。农业生产也出现一片热气腾腾的丰收景象，粮食产量将比去年有大幅度增长。
    大庆油田工农业生产的发展，是毛主席提出的各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的光辉思想的胜利。它以无可争辩的事实显示了，以毛泽东思想为指针建设起来的工农结合城乡结合的新型矿区的无比优越性。它既可以大大促进人们的思想革命化，促进逐步缩小工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，又有利于工业和农业的统一规划，人力、物力的统一调配，做到工农业互相促进，使生产力得到了飞跃的发展。
    在油田开发初期，大庆职工和家属遵照毛主席的指示，在高速度、高水平地拿下世界第一流大油田的同时，还用自己勤劳的双手开垦了几十万亩荒地。每年，工人除了做工，还参加农业劳动；家属以农为主，也参加工业劳动。职工和家属共同在革命化的大道上前进。几年来，工农业生产都创造了优异的成绩。
    今年，大庆职工有计划地积极地参加了油田的农副业生产。他们参加了春耕、夏锄、麦收，为家属生产队平整、翻耙轮休地五万多亩，打水井几十口，开凿了长达五十二公里的防洪排涝渠，使十万多亩土地收到了灌溉、排涝效益。他们还为家属生产队培养了许多拖拉机手。到八月底为止，职工们总共做了十七万多个农业劳动日，他们拿起工具能做工，拿起锄头能种地，许多人熟练地掌握了各种农活。在工业的支援下，大庆的农副业生产现在已大部分实现了机械化，生产水平日益提高。今年，大庆家属和职工种的十万亩小麦获得了丰收，平均亩产量比去年增长四成以上。玉米、大豆等大田作物即将收割完毕，产量也将比去年增加很多。当前，家属和职工正在大搞积肥，进行秋翻地和送肥工作，为明年生产作准备。
    大庆的职工家属在把农业生产一面天顶起来的同时，还实行农忙务农，农闲做工，积极参加工业上的辅助性劳动。她们办工厂，修公路，开商店，把服务工作做到了工地。许多家属还掌握了一些现代化生产技术。今年以来，家属共做了四十万个工业劳动日，为油田的建设做出了自己的贡献。
    今年油田工农业生产建设取得的巨大成就，是大庆职工和家属活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，认真贯彻执行十六条，抓革命，促生产的结果。今年大庆油田工业生产任务比往年重，但是，他们把生产仗当政治仗打，充分依靠群众，大搞工人设计，大搞科学研究，从而克服了一个又一个困难，在生产上取得了一个又一个胜利。在农业方面，家属们通过反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章，从毛主席著作中汲取了无穷无尽的力量，战胜了春旱和虫灾。在无产阶级文化大革命中，她们又以田间当战场，把锄头当刀枪，大大加强作物的田间管理，大田作物普遍追了两次肥，全部实现了三铲三趟，夺得了农业的好收成。
