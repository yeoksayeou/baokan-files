The red nuclear missile soars into the sky, with a thunderous roar;
The hearts of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists tremble, while the revolutionary people sing in joy!

    The same sound evokes completely different feelings and reactions among the revolutionary people and the counter-revolutionary forces.

    "China successfully tests nuclear missile weapons!" This earth-shattering news is like a spring thunder and a symphony to the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people around the world, bringing smiles and immense joy; but to the imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries, this news is like a thunderbolt, striking them a heavy blow, leaving them stunned and shocked!

    From October 16, 1964, when our country conducted its first nuclear test, to now, it has only been a little over two years. China has successfully launched a nuclear missile test. The "tigers" and "bears" of the world, facing this stern reality, some say they are "surprised," others shout "unexpected" ... a chorus of "surprise."

    This chorus of "surprise" reminds us of U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara's "prophecy" two years ago. After our country's first nuclear test, this secretary of defense, posing as a "prophet," declared: China will not have nuclear-tipped missiles for another ten years. We still vividly remember that it was not just this secretary of defense who made such a "prophecy"; wasn't Khrushchev also singing a similar tune?

    Now, their "prophecies" have completely failed, and these gentlemen are all lousy "prophets"!

    All reactionaries always underestimate the power of the revolutionary people. Chairman Mao said: "... They use a subjective and metaphysical method to think, so their estimates are always wrong. Their class instincts lead them to always think: they themselves are so great, while the revolutionary forces are always not up to the mark." The "imperialist" and "revisionist" lords, with their heads full of subjective and metaphysical worldviews and methodologies, do not "prophecy" if they do not, but once they do, they are bound to fail. This is inevitable.

    McNamara and the likes of Khrushchev use subjective and metaphysical methods to estimate the power of the Chinese people and make their "prophecies." They do not understand and cannot possibly understand that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the means and ability to achieve great leaps in the development of science and technology, have the wisdom and strength to create miracles in the world. Therefore, they always say that what we can do is "impossible," and what we can quickly achieve is "not fast enough." The great creative power and great victories of the Chinese people have repeatedly shattered their nonsense. Thus, they can only be: "stunned," "shocked."

    A Western news agency reported that China's nuclear test "once again shocked the world, even with a double shock." Let the imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries experience "double shock," "triple shock"! Honestly, the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will make you experience "double shock," "triple shock" and more. Just wait and see!

    “预言家”们的“震惊”
    辛午
    红色核导弹腾空起，惊天动地一声响；
    美帝苏修心里慌，革命人民齐欢唱！
    ——同是一种声响，在革命人民和反革命势力中，产生了完全两样的感觉，引起了截然不同的反应。
    “中国发射导弹核武器试验成功！”这惊天动地的声音，对越南人民和全世界革命人民来说，如春雷，似乐章，听了喜笑颜开，高兴万分；但是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派来说，这声音却如霹雳，给他们当头一棒，他们闻之目瞪口呆，震惊不已！
    从一九六四年十月十六日我国第一次核试验起，到现在还不过短短的两年零十几天，我们中国发射导弹核武器试验成功了。世界上的“虎豹”和“熊罴”们，面对这个严峻的客观事实，有的说“感到意外”，有的喊“出乎预料”……一片“意外”声。
    这一片“意外”声，不禁使我们想起了美国国防部长麦克纳马拉两年前的一次“预言”。那是在我国第一次核试验之后，这位国防部长摆出一副“预言家”的架势说道：中国要在十年以后才会拥有带核弹头的导弹。我们还清楚地记得，作过这种“预言”的又岂止这一位美国国防部长，赫鲁晓夫之流不是也唱过类似的调子吗！
    如今，他们的“预言”已经彻底破产，这些老爷全是蹩脚透顶的“预言家”！
    一切反动派总是低估革命人民的力量的。毛主席说过：“……他们用以想事的方法是主观主义的和形而上学的方法，因此他们的估计总是错误的。他们的阶级本能引导他们老是在想：他们自己怎样了不起，而革命势力总是不行的。”“帝”字号、“修”字号的老爷们，满脑子装的是主观主义和形而上学的世界观、方法论，他们不“预言”还罢，一“预言”则准破产。这是必然无疑的。
    麦克纳马拉和赫鲁晓夫之流，就是用主观主义和形而上学的方法，来估计中国人民的力量，来作出他们的“预言”的。他们不懂得、也不可能懂得，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，有办法、有能耐在发展科学技术上实现大跃进，有智慧、有力量创造出人间的奇迹。所以，他们总是把我们能够办到的事情说成是“不可能”，把我们能够迅速地实现的事情断定为“快不了”。中国人民的伟大创造力和伟大胜利的事实，一次又一次地粉碎了他们的胡言乱语。于是，他们就只能是：“目瞪口呆”，“震惊不已”。
    一家西方通讯社报道，中国的这次核试验，“再一次使世界震惊，甚至是双重的震惊”。让帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派“双重的震惊”去吧！老实告诉你们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，要使你们“双重震惊”、“三重震惊”的事还多着呢，你们等着吧！
