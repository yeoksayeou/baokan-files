Vice Premier Chen Yi, at a banquet hosted for Tanzanian guests, said that China's Cultural Revolution makes friends happy and enemies afraid. Team Leader Kidtondu said that China's Cultural Revolution has shattered the illusions of imperialism.

	BEIJING, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) — Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the Tanzanian friendly delegation led by Tanzanian Coast Province Governor Kidtondu.

	At the banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, has already achieved tremendous victories. We are advancing in victory, and the situation is getting better and better. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will block the road to capitalist restoration, further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and develop China's socialist system. Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the world's people are overjoyed and strongly support China's Cultural Revolution. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are extremely panicked. They spread rumors and maliciously curse us everywhere, which exposes their reactionary and ugly faces even more to the people of the world and further proves that the Chinese people are doing the right thing.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Tanzanian friends visiting our country have seen with their own eyes the new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works and establishing Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese people, and have seen with their own eyes the revolutionary prosperity brought by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Vice Premier Chen Yi expressed his gratitude to the Tanzanian friends for their praise of China's Cultural Revolution.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned in his speech that American imperialism, modern revisionism, and their followers are plotting a new "peace talk" conspiracy, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national revolutionary war. Vice Premier Chen Yi said, however, that the people of the world see clearly that the crux of the Vietnamese issue is that the U.S. aggressor troops must withdraw from Vietnam completely, thoroughly, and cleanly. Without this, there is no question of any Geneva Agreement, let alone any peaceful solution to the Vietnamese issue. Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that any proposal or advocacy that does not demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops, whether through the United Nations or any conference of several countries, is a cover for the U.S. imperialists to continue increasing troops in Vietnam and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, which is something that Vietnam absolutely cannot agree to.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi also said that we Asian and African countries have all been countries long subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression. In the struggle against imperialism, the peoples of Asian and African countries are one. Today, on the issue of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, we Asian and African countries and peoples can only stand on the side of the Vietnamese people who insist on the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Vice Premier Chen Yi said that we believe that the Asian and African countries and peoples can see through the trap of the "peace talk" conspiracy created by American imperialism and can see through the true face of the accomplices and lackeys of American imperialism.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterated that the Chinese government and people most warmly and resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call for anti-American national salvation. He said: Seven hundred million Chinese people have already made preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support our Vietnamese brothers and sisters in fighting the anti-American national salvation struggle to the end. Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the Tanzanian people for their great victories in the struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, old and new, and for national independence, and wished the Tanzanian people continued progress on the road to independence and development. He also praised the delegation's visit to our country, which has made new contributions to enhancing mutual understanding and friendly unity between the peoples of China and Tanzania.

	Team Leader Kidtondu spoke at the banquet. He enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao in China. He said that the Cultural Revolution aims to eliminate all old things that do not conform to socialism, making the country more united, more consolidated, and more powerful. He condemned imperialism for attacking and slandering China's Cultural Revolution and defaming New China. He said that imperialism does so because the Cultural Revolution has touched their sore spot and shattered their illusions of "peaceful evolution" in China. He said that the Cultural Revolution in China is writing a new history of socialist revolution.

	Kidtondu said that Chairman Mao Zedong is the wise and great leader of the Chinese people. Mao Zedong Thought is the further development of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought has given the Chinese people a unified will and formed a strong unity. He congratulated the Chinese people on achieving greater successes under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

	Finally, he proposed a toast to the health of Chairman Mao and to the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania.

	Attending the banquet were Zhang Qixiao, Ji Pengfei, Ding Xilin, and other relevant officials. Tanzanian Ambassador to China Waziri Juma was also invited to the banquet.

    陈毅副总理在宴请坦桑尼亚客人招待会上说
    我国文化大革命使朋友高兴敌人害怕
    基顿杜团长说中国文化大革命粉碎了帝国主义的幻想
    新华社四日讯　陈毅副总理今晚举行宴会，招待由坦桑尼亚海岸省省长基顿杜率领的坦桑尼亚友好代表团。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话说，我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了巨大的胜利。我们正在胜利前进，形势越来越好。我国无产阶级文化大革命将堵死资本主义复辟的道路，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，发展我国的社会主义制度。陈毅副总理说，对中国的文化大革命，世界各国人民欢欣鼓舞，热烈支持。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派却万分惊慌，他们到处造谣，恶毒咒骂，这就在世界人民面前更加暴露了他们的反动的丑恶面目，更加证明了中国人民做得好，做得对。
    陈毅副总理说，坦桑尼亚的朋友们访问我们国家，亲眼看到了我国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中，大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，促使人的思想革命化的新高潮，亲眼看到了我国无产阶级文化大革命带来的一片革命的繁荣景象。陈毅副总理表示感谢坦桑尼亚朋友对我国文化大革命的赞扬。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义、现代修正主义和他们的追随者，正在策划新的“和谈”阴谋，企图扑灭越南人民反美民族革命战争的烈火。陈毅副总理说，但是，全世界人民看得很清楚，越南问题的焦点是美国侵略军必须立即从越南全部、彻底、干净地撤出去。离开这一点，根本谈不上什么日内瓦协议，更谈不上什么和平解决越南问题。陈毅副总理指出，任何不要美国撤军的建议和主张，无论通过联合国或者什么几个国家的会议，都是替美帝国主义继续增兵越南、扩大侵略越南战争打掩护，都是越南绝对不能同意的。
    陈毅副总理还说，我们亚非国家，都是长期遭受帝国主义侵略和压迫的国家。在反对帝国主义的斗争中，亚非各国人民是一个整体。今天，在美帝国主义侵略越南的问题上，我们亚非国家和人民只能站在坚持抗美救国斗争的越南人民一边。陈毅副总理说，我们相信，亚非国家和人民能够识破美帝国主义制造“和谈”阴谋的圈套，能够看清美帝国主义帮凶和走卒的真面目。
    陈毅副总理重申，中国政府和中国人民最热烈、最坚决地支持胡志明主席的抗美救国的号召书。他说：七亿中国人民已经作好了准备，我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底。陈毅副总理赞扬坦桑尼亚人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争中所取得的重大胜利，并祝坦桑尼亚人民在独立发展的道路上不断向前迈进。他还赞扬代表团的这次访问我国，为增进中坦两国人民的互相了解和友好团结作出了新的贡献。
    基顿杜团长在宴会上讲话。他热烈赞扬毛主席亲自领导的中国的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，文化大革命要消灭一切不适应社会主义的旧东西，使你们的国家更加团结、更加巩固、更加强大。他谴责帝国主义攻击、诬蔑中国的文化大革命和诽谤新中国。他说，帝国主义所以这样做，是因为文化大革命触动了他们的痛处，打破了他们对中国“和平演变”的幻想。他说，中国文化大革命正在写着社会主义革命的新历史。
    基顿杜说，毛泽东主席是中国人民英明伟大的领袖。毛泽东思想是进一步发展了的马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想使中国人民有了统一的意志，形成了坚强的团结。他祝贺中国人民在毛主席的领导下，取得更大的成就。
    最后，他提议为毛主席的健康，为中坦两国人民的友谊干杯。
    出席宴会作陪的，有张奚若、姬鹏飞、丁西林等有关方面负责人。坦桑尼亚驻中国大使瓦齐里·朱马也应邀出席了宴会。
