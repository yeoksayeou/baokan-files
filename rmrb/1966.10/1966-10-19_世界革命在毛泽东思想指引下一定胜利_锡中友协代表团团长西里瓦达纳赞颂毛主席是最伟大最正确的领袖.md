The delegation head of the Sino-Ceylon Friendship Association, Sirivardhana, spoke to a reporter from our news agency during his visit to our country, saying: "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest and most correct leader. Mao Zedong Thought has shown the correct revolutionary path to all the people of the world. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary cause of all oppressed nations and peoples will surely achieve victory."

Sirivardhana said, "The Chinese people, regardless of age or gender, all love Chairman Mao deeply. Everyone studies the works of Chairman Mao and acts according to his instructions, actively participating in the ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They actively support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and are full of confidence in defeating American imperialism."

During his visit, Sirivardhana personally witnessed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. He said: "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution being carried out in China has greatly inspired and aided the revolutionary people of the world, pointing out the direction of revolution for the revolutionary people of the world."

He emphasized, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will definitely be carried through to the end, uprooting the roots of capitalism and revisionism, and achieving final victory. Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people will be united even more closely, and their will more unified."

Pointing to the red armband he wore on his left arm, Sirivardhana excitedly told the reporter, "This was given to us by the Red Guards after we had a discussion with them at a school and established a deep friendship. We think this is the most precious gift. From that day on, the members of our delegation have all been wearing the red armband." He said, "The Red Guards have left a deep impression on us. Wherever we go, the Red Guards welcome and receive us enthusiastically, shake hands with us, and have friendly conversations. They actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, serve the people, help the people with their work; they are disciplined, upright, and live frugally."
