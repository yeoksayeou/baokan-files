Red Guards and revolutionary students from various places who came to Beijing for revolutionary exchanges have returned to their battle stations with the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the rich fighting experience of the revolutionary students in the capital. They are full of fighting spirit.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 15th, in the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, batches of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country who came to the capital for revolutionary exchanges have returned to their respective battle stations with the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the rich fighting experience of the revolutionary students in the capital. They are full of fighting spirit. Millions of revolutionary youngsters have returned from the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing with a common resolve: to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to resolutely implement the Sixteen Points, to bravely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to spread the revolutionary spark lit by Chairman Mao across the country, thus pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward to greater victories.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students regard the day they were received by Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square as the happiest and most unforgettable day of their lives. They recorded this happy moment in their copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the spot. As soon as they returned to school, they immediately conveyed the inspiration and revolutionary enthusiasm they received to millions of revolutionary classmates, bringing great fighting strength to the broad masses of revolutionary students. The broad masses of revolutionary students enthusiastically cheer for the health of the great leader Chairman Mao and feel extremely honored and proud to have such a great leader leading us to victory. They expressed their determination to turn Chairman Mao's warm care into a source of revolutionary fighting strength and to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary experience of the capital has countless aspects, but the most fundamental one is to study Chairman Mao's works and to uphold Mao Zedong Thought. This is the common feeling of the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students who came to Beijing for revolutionary exchanges. At present, a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has formed in schools across the country. In many schools in Guangzhou, the practice of "daily reading" Chairman Mao's works has been widely implemented. Revolutionary students all carry the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, discuss work together, participate in debates, and carry out criticism and struggle. In Shanghai, many revolutionary youngsters not only study Chairman Mao's works more diligently but also form propaganda teams to frequently propagate the Sixteen Points and the great Mao Zedong Thought on the streets and in public buses and trams. Revolutionary students in some schools in Wuhan, based on the principle of learning first what is urgently needed, have recently selected Chairman Mao's quotations on class struggle and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as the "Three Articles," and have studied and applied them repeatedly, making many of Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints gradually deepen and take root in everyone's mind.

The Red Guards and revolutionary students from various places who came to the capital for revolutionary exchanges have a clearer understanding of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line in the current cultural revolution. After returning from Beijing, many Red Guards and revolutionary students in schools in Shenyang, Harbin, Xi'an, and Chengdu have become even more daring, fearless of difficulties, and bravely thrown themselves into the battle.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students from various places who came to the capital for revolutionary exchanges never forget the call of Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, and are determined to learn well from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to temper themselves into fighters with high political consciousness and high organizational discipline, to be the reserve army of the PLA, and to be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    勇敢捍卫毛主席代表的无产阶级革命路线  坚决把毛主席点燃的革命火种传遍全国
    各地来京串连的红卫兵和革命师生，带着伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀，斗志昂扬地回到战斗岗位。
    据新华社十五日讯　在波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命中，全国各地来首都进行革命串连的一批又一批红卫兵和革命师生，带着伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和首都革命师生的丰富斗争经验，斗志昂扬地陆续回到了各自的战斗岗位。成百万革命小将从无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京带回的共同决心是：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行十六条，勇敢捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把毛主席亲自点燃的革命火种传遍四方，更有力地推动无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进。
    广大红卫兵和革命师生把在天安门受到毛主席接见的日子看作自己一生最最幸福、最最难忘的日子。他们曾当场在《毛主席语录》本上记下了这个幸福的时刻。一回到学校，他们立刻把自己受到的鼓舞和革命激情，传到了千百万革命同学当中，给广大革命师生带来巨大的战斗力量。广大革命师生为伟大领袖毛主席的健康尽情欢呼，为有这样的伟大领袖领导我们胜利前进感到无上光荣和自豪。他们表示要把毛主席的亲切关怀变成革命斗争力量的源泉，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。
    首都的革命经验千条万条，最根本的一条就是大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想。这是各地来京进行革命串连的广大红卫兵和革命师生的共同感受。目前，一个在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，已经在各地学校中形成。广州市许多学校普遍实行了“天天读”毛主席著作的制度，革命师生人人随身带着《毛主席语录》，共同商量工作，参加辩论，开展批判斗争。上海许多革命小将现在不但更加勤奋地学习毛主席著作，并且组成了宣传队，经常在街头、公共汽车电车上，向群众宣传十六条，宣传伟大的毛泽东思想。武汉市一些学校的革命师生，本着急用先学的原则，最近选择毛主席有关阶级斗争、有关无产阶级文化大革命的语录和“老三篇”等文章，反复学习，反复运用，使毛主席的许多根本观点，在大家头脑里逐步加深，逐步扎根。
    来首都进行革命串连的各地红卫兵和革命师生，对当前文化大革命中以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争有了更明确的认识。沈阳、哈尔滨、西安、成都等地许多学校的红卫兵和革命师生，从北京取经回去以后，“敢”字当头，不畏困难，更加勇敢地投入了战斗。
    各地来京进行革命串连的广大红卫兵和革命师生，念念不忘毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志的号召，决心好好向工农兵学习，把自己锻炼成为具有高度政治觉悟和高度组织性纪律性的战士，作解放军的后备军，作无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
