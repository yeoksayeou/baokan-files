The large-scale color documentary films "Chairman Mao and the Million-Strong Cultural Revolution Army Together" and "Chairman Mao Meets the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students" have been screened in various provinces and cities across the country during the National Day holiday. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres have watched these films with great excitement, sharing the happiness of being with the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao on screen. They have been greatly inspired.

The broad revolutionary masses have expressed their unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao and his thoughts with boundless love, loyalty, and faith. They have treated the screening of these two films as a great joyous event. Movie theaters and screening points across the country have been decorated like during a festival, with large portraits of Chairman Mao and banners hanging. Revolutionary masses have flocked to the theaters in groups, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding high red flags and quotations from Chairman Mao, and singing revolutionary songs like "The Ship Sails on Because It Has a Helmsman."

In some places, the broad revolutionary masses have called the movie tickets "notices to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao." Inside the theaters, whenever the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao appears on the screen, the audience erupts in cheers. The broad revolutionary masses and the comrades on screen shout in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sing "The Ship Sails on Because It Has a Helmsman." Seeing Chairman Mao so spirited and healthy, the broad revolutionary masses are overjoyed, saying that Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and for revolutionary people around the world. Many are moved to tears. Many have written poems and quick-talk verses on the spot to express their revolutionary resolve. A young worker wrote a poem after watching the film, representing the sentiments of the broad revolutionary masses: "We, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, have the reddest hearts and the clearest eyes, leading the revolution. We will forever follow Chairman Mao, generation after generation, making revolution, sweeping away all harmful elements!"

After watching the films, workers have expressed their determination to follow the example of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, internalizing Chairman Mao's instructions, and implementing them in action. They have said that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to seriously and diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on mastering the essence, turning our factories into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting revolution and production, and contributing all our efforts to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end and complete the Third Five-Year Plan. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Third General Machinery Factory have said that these two films have given us unlimited confidence and strength to carry out the Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, carry out the Cultural Revolution, and promote production. The famous Daqing-style enterprise, the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, had many workers shed tears of excitement while watching the film. They said that Chairman Mao's repeated meetings with the revolutionary masses have given us great encouragement and strength. One week after Chairman Mao's third meeting with the million revolutionary youngsters, the workers of this factory, with great revolutionary spirit, overcame various difficulties and successfully cast a special large steel piece, making an important contribution to China's heavy machinery manufacturing industry.

When these two films were screened in urban suburbs and rural areas, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, who have been longing for Chairman Mao, were all inspired and joyful. In the suburbs of Shenyang, Zhang Guosheng, a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants in Liaoning Province, brought his entire family to watch the film. He told everyone, "I came today to see Chairman Mao!" After watching the film, he was very excited and immediately wrote a quick-talk verse, expressing his determination to always read Chairman Mao's books and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, forever following Chairman Mao in revolution. In the suburbs of Xi'an, more than seventy members of the Dongfanghong Commune who participated in the training class for militia instructors on studying Chairman Mao's works watched "Chairman Mao Meets the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students" together. They expressed their determination to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage with all the militia; to focus on mastering the essence, emphasizing implementation, creating a new situation, and raising the level of study. The broad revolutionary masses in Lhasa were deeply moved while watching the documentary "Chairman Mao Meets the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students." Millions of excited hearts flew to Chairman Mao, millions of eyes filled with tears of happiness looked up at Chairman Mao, and millions of voices merged into one sentence: "Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for us, the million liberated serfs. We will forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution, unchanging hearts even if the sea dries up and the rocks crumble."

After watching the film "Chairman Mao Meets the Red Guards and Revolutionary Students," the soldiers stationed in various places have unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and forever follow Chairman Mao, bravely advancing through storms and waves. Soldier Liu Zhongde from a unit of the People's Liberation Army in Jiangxi Province wrote passionately: "Chairman Mao's books, every golden word is a call to advance, every quotation is a mobilization order, every work is a revolutionary treasure. I will read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, forever follow Chairman Mao, and make revolution for a lifetime."

Chairman Mao's three meetings with the revolutionary youngsters in one month have greatly inspired the broad revolutionary students and Red Guards. Two students from Shanghai Conservatory of Music, who are of Tibetan serf origin, recalled the happy scene of seeing Chairman Mao in Beijing on September 15th when they saw him on the screen, and they were moved to tears. They said, "Chairman Mao has given us the greatest trust and care. Without Chairman Mao's leadership, there would be nothing for us, and nothing for all the laboring people of China. We will seriously and diligently study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao in revolution forever!" The Red Guards from Harbin Institute of Technology, who saw our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Rostrum on August 31st, said excitedly after watching the film, "On the road of the Cultural Revolution, we have the beacon of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought to guide us, and the great helmsman Chairman Mao to steer us. We dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire! We have full confidence and determination to create a new world where Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly."
