Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated Caixi. In the former Central Soviet Area model township, now Caixi Commune in Shanghang County, Fujian Province, every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao, and Mao's quotations are posted everywhere. Every village has a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda station, and everyone loves to read Chairman Mao's works. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be like Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the new Yu Gong, have become good customs in Caixi.

Our great leader Chairman Mao came to Caixi in 1933 and wrote the famous "Investigation of Caixi Township." In 1934, in the article "Care for the People's Livelihood and Pay Attention to Work Methods," he again praised Caixi Township. Chairman Mao's praise and encouragement for Caixi Township have shown the people of Caixi the direction to overcome difficulties and move forward!

Brigade Party Branch Deputy Secretary and Women's Federation Chairwoman Wu Shujin once felt that women's work was difficult to do and even blamed female commune members for being backward. She studied Chairman Mao's "Care for the People's Livelihood and Pay Attention to Work Methods" several times, and the more she studied, the brighter she felt, determined to listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Wu Shujin, together with women representatives from various production teams, investigated how many pregnant women there were in the entire brigade, how many were breastfeeding, and how many elderly women could take care of children. They discussed with everyone and made reasonable arrangements for the work: pregnant women do light work and not heavy work, breastfeeding women do nearby work and not far work, and elderly women help take care of children. They conducted ideological education for female commune members. Women's specific difficulties were solved, and their enthusiasm for labor reached an unprecedented height. They not only actively participated in production but also cared about the collective and national affairs.

Caixi Township has a famous poor place called "Weak Pit" in the past, which was afraid of both flooding and drought, with a grain yield of only about a hundred jin per mu. When Chairman Mao investigated here, he kindly told the poor and lower-middle peasants, "Weak Pit is not good, it should be called Rich Pit." The poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's instructions, changed the name to "Rich Pit," and under the encouragement of Chairman Mao's teachings, persisted in the socialist direction and strived to develop production. Now, Weak Pit has been transformed into a true Rich Pit.

The production team leader of Rich Pit, 69-year-old old poor peasant Lin Panfu, was the township farmers' association group leader at that time, saw Chairman Mao, and heard Chairman Mao's kind words. No matter what difficulties he encountered, as long as he read Chairman Mao's books, he was full of energy.

In 1962, a wave of individual farming swept through here, and some well-off middle peasants advocated dividing the land back to individual farming. Lin Panfu firmly said, "Without Chairman Mao's instructions, no one is allowed to divide." He took his grandson wearing a red scarf and went door to door to propagate Chairman Mao's "Introduction to a Cooperative." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants realized that only by relying on the collective could they thoroughly uproot poverty, and they resolutely opposed individual farming and persisted in the collectivization path.

Last year, an irrigation canal that had just been opened was washed away by a mountain flood. Some commune members lost heart. Lin Panfu held Mao Zedong's works and had his grandson read to him sentence by sentence. The spirit of the old Yu Gong inspired him. As soon as spring came this year, he went up the mountain to dig the canal again. The entire team of commune members, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, dug countless large and small stones, drilled through the giant rocks, and opened the irrigation canal. When the canal water flowed into the dry fields, Lin Panfu happily told the commune members, "This water is from Beijing! It is from Chairman Mao!"

Rich Pit has been continuously carrying out agricultural and water conservancy construction in recent years. Now, the yield per mu has increased from over a hundred jin in the early days of liberation to over seven hundred jin. Before the cooperative, it had to rely on the state for over six hundred thousand jin of grain every year. Since 1959, it has been selling over four hundred thousand jin of surplus grain to the state every year.

The changes in Rich Pit are a microcosm of the changes in Caixi, a red flower and a big fruit blossomed and borne by Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛泽东思想照红了才溪
    在前中央苏区模范乡、现在的福建省上杭县才溪公社，家家挂着毛主席像，处处贴着毛主席语录，村村有毛泽东思想宣传站，人人爱读毛主席著作。毛泽东思想照红了才溪。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，当张思德、白求恩、新愚公，已是才溪的好风气。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，一九三三年来到才溪，写了著名的《才溪乡调查》；一九三四年在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文中，又表扬了才溪乡。毛主席对才溪乡的表扬和鼓励，给才溪人民战胜困难指出了前进的方向！
    大队党支部副书记、妇代会主任吴树金，有一段时间感到妇女工作不好做，甚至埋怨女社员落后。她几次学习毛主席写的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，越学心里越亮，决心要听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。
    吴树金和各生产队妇女代表一起，调查了全大队有多少孕妇，多少给孩子喂奶的，有多少能带孩子的老妈妈，并和大家商量，把工作做了合理安排：孕妇干轻活不干重活，喂奶的干近活不干远活，老妈妈帮助带孩子。他们向女社员进行了思想教育。妇女们的具体困难解决了，劳动热情空前高涨，不仅积极参加生产，而且关心集体，关心国家大事。
    才溪乡有个有名的穷地方，过去叫“衰坑”，怕涝怕旱，粮食亩产量只有百来斤。当年毛主席在这里调查的时候，亲切地对贫下中农说：“叫衰坑不好，要叫发坑。”贫下中农遵照毛主席的意见，改名为“发坑”，并在毛主席教导的鼓舞下，坚持社会主义方向，努力发展生产，现在，衰坑已改造成为真正的发坑。
    发坑生产队长、六十九岁的老贫农林攀福，当年是乡农会小组长，见过毛主席，听过毛主席的亲切讲话。他不论碰到什么困难，只要读了毛主席的书，就浑身是劲。
    一九六二年这里刮起了一股单干风，有些富裕中农主张把地分回去种。林攀福斩钉截铁地说：“没有毛主席的指示，谁也不许分。”他拉着戴红领巾的小孙儿，挨家挨户地宣传毛主席写的《介绍一个合作社》。广大贫下中农认识到只有依靠集体，才能彻底挖掉穷根，就坚决反对单干，坚持走集体化道路。
    去年刚开的水渠，被一场山洪冲刷得无影无踪。有些社员泄气了。林攀福捧着毛主席著作，叫小孙儿一句句念给他听，老愚公的精神鼓舞了他，今年一开春，又再次上山开渠。全队社员用愚公移山的精神，挖起数以万计的大小石块，凿穿了巨石，开成了水渠。当渠水流进旱田时，林攀福高兴地向社员们说道：“这水是北京来的呀！是毛主席那里来的！”
    发坑，几年来不断进行农田基本建设和水利建设，现在亩产量从解放初期一百多斤提高到七百多斤。合作化前每年要国家供应六万多斤粮食，从一九五九年起每年向国家交售四万多斤余粮。
    发坑的变化是才溪变化的缩影，是毛泽东思想开的红花，结的硕果。
