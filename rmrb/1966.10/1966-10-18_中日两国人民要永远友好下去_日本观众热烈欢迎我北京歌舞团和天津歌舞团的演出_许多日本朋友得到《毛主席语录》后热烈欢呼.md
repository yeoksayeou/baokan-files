	The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe of China received a warm welcome from the Japanese audience on the evening of October 14th in Kitakyushu, Japan. The performance was another resounding success, with the Japanese people showing their enthusiasm and support.

	When the stage lit up with a radiant portrait of Chairman Mao and his quote, "The Japanese people are a great people. They will never allow the American imperialists to ride roughshod over them for long," the Japanese friends in the audience could not help but applaud enthusiastically, expressing their boundless respect for the great Chairman Mao.

	During one of the performances, the stage featured spirited Red Guards loudly reciting Chairman Mao's quote, "The thousand and one truths of Marxism can be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" The Japanese audience once again clapped enthusiastically, moved by the performance.

	The Chinese performers sang the revolutionary Japanese song "Give Us Back Okinawa," and the audience below responded with fervent shouts of "Give Us Back Okinawa!" This demonstrated the shared sentiment of the Chinese and Japanese people against their common enemy.

	Japanese friends from Yamaguchi Prefecture, who had traveled a long distance, expressed their special enthusiasm for the successful performance. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship!" After the performance, they rushed onto the stage to embrace and cheer with the Chinese performers. The Chinese performers presented the Japanese friends with Japanese editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The Japanese friends, who had long awaited this red treasure, excitedly said, "We will study it diligently and use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to fight resolutely." At this moment, the stage echoed with the majestic song "The East Is Red," praising the great leader Chairman Mao.

	According to a report from the New China News Agency on October 15th, the Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe of China, which is currently visiting Japan, performed in an open-air square of a chemical factory in Tokyo on the 15th. The performance was met with enthusiastic applause from the Japanese workers.

	The Chinese artists performed songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, such as "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman." Each performance was met with enthusiastic applause. These performances stirred the audience's boundless love for Chairman Mao. Many in the audience requested badges featuring Chairman Mao's portrait from the performers of the song and dance troupe.

	The workers were deeply moved by the Chinese performers coming to the factory to perform for them. An elderly worker excitedly said, "The people of China and Japan are brothers. We must remain friends forever."

	Another young worker expressed to the performers, "I deeply admire your spirit of serving the workers and peasants."

	According to a report from the New China News Agency on October 17th, all members of the Tianjin Song and Dance Troupe of China, who are currently visiting Japan, held a gathering with 300 Japanese youth in Hakodate, Hokkaido, on the evening of the 16th. Throughout the gathering, the atmosphere was filled with the fervent friendship between the youth and people of China and Japan.

	Some Japanese youth eagerly requested "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the Chinese performers during the gathering. Upon receiving this revolutionary treasure, one youth excitedly raised his hand and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Another Japanese youth noticed that a member of the song and dance troupe was holding a portrait of Chairman Mao and walked over to hang some flowers on it, expressing his admiration for Chairman Mao.
