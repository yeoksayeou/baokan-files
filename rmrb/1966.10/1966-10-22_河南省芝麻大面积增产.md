Henan Province, a major sesame-producing region in China, has seen a bumper harvest this year with over three million mu of sesame planted.

This year, despite facing prolonged droughts during the sesame cultivation process, the broad masses of commune members in Henan Province persisted in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, overcoming hardships and difficulties, and strengthening field management. Ultimately, they triumphed over the drought. The four major sesame-producing areas of Nanyang, Zhumadian, Zhoukou, and Xuchang all achieved significant increases in production.

Sesame produced in Henan Province is known for its thin skin, fragrant aroma, and high oil content. The sesame oil processed from it is popular in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places.
