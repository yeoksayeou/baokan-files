In the joyous city of Beijing

When the news of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon test was announced, the capital has been immersed in a wave of joy for days. Revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country, as well as workers, peasants, cadres, and residents of the capital, have been carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, large banners, joyous news, Little Red Books, wreaths, and flowers, drumming and cheering to report the good news to Chairman Mao and to cheer for the great leader, Chairman Mao!

These days, in the joyous Beijing, there have been countless touching stories and scenes. Let us recount a few!

From the bedside to the joyous report

There were two Red Guard brothers who had come to Beijing for revolutionary activities. The younger brother suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized. Due to the severity of the illness, the elder brother stayed by his side day and night.

At 00:50 on October 28th, the news of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon test spread like a spring breeze to the hospital. The elder brother, who had been guarding his younger brother, was very excited and wanted to join the parade but couldn't leave. He quickly found paper and ink to write a big joyous report, expressing the feelings of the two brothers. Then, in a short time, he rushed to the newspaper office to request that his joyous report be sent to Chairman Mao. It was late at night, and he raised his voice in the midst of drumming and cheering to express the feelings of the two brothers to the comrades there. Then, with a slightly calmed heart, he rushed back to the hospital to take care of the patient. The revolutionary spirit of the young fighters is like fire, and they, though by the bedside, have hearts that leap for joy at our successful missile and nuclear weapon test. Their hearts are with Chairman Mao.

One hundred "red peanuts"

A team of revolutionary students from another province, after reading the big red joyous report, immediately handed over a big red package to the person in charge of the central reception station: "Comrade, please hand this package to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!"

Upon opening the package, one hundred plump and full red peanuts were found!

What was this about? We were still guessing when we saw a few letters folded at the bottom of the package.

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, how we long for Beijing, how we yearn to see you in person! For many years and many months, day and night, moment by moment, we have been waiting and waiting, and finally, this happy day, this unforgettable day has come! We, the representatives selected from an agricultural middle school in Sichuan, have come to your side. Here, we have heard the news of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon test. We are so happy, so fortunate! On behalf of all the revolutionary students in our school, we present one hundred peanuts to you. These peanuts are grown by us after clearing the land, and are the largest peanuts selected by all the students. Please inspect the students' achievements of 'studying as the main task, learning other things as well'; please taste and accept our good wishes. One hundred peanuts, thousands of hearts, each red heart is with Chairman Mao, with the city of Beijing."

Salute to China's red missile and nuclear weapons, to Chairman Mao!

On October 28th, in the sea of people and forest of red flags at Tiananmen Square, there were also many international friends. Among them, one person, after cheering for this great victory, pushed his way to the front of Tiananmen and stopped. He solemnly looked up at the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, bowed deeply, and then, with a smile, left the square.

In his deep gaze at the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, how much love for Chairman Mao was contained! How much joy and happiness for China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test was contained!

It was also on this day that a foreign expert working in the publishing department, with a translator, carrying a banner and a letter of congratulations, walked and shouted slogans, coming to the Central Committee's reception station. He stood by the loudspeaker, excitedly reading his letter of congratulations. After finishing, he joined the crowd, took photos with the Red Guards, and shouted in Chinese: "Heartily congratulate China's successful missile and nuclear weapon test! Long live Mao Zedong, long live Mao Zedong!" As he shouted, he couldn't help but shed tears of joy. He was happy and fortunate for the world's revolutionary people to have Chairman Mao and China. How could the joyous Beijing, full of revolutionary vigor, not move him so?

    在欢腾的北京城里
    红波
    当我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息公布后，连日来，首都沉浸在一片欢腾之中。来自全国的革命师生、红卫兵和首都的工农兵、机关干部、居民，抬着毛主席像，巨幅标语，喜报，拿着语录本、花环和鲜花，敲锣打鼓，向毛主席报喜，向伟大的领袖毛主席欢呼！
    这些天，在欢腾的北京，不知有多少动人的故事和场景。这里，让我们记述几则吧！
    从病床边送来的喜报
    有兄弟两个红卫兵，前些日子革命串连来到了北京。弟弟突然患病住了医院，由于病势较重，哥哥就整日守在弟弟的身边。
    十月二十八日零点五十分，我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息像春风一样，传到了医院。一直在守护弟弟的哥哥，这时心情很激动，想上街去参加游行，又走不了。他就急忙找来笔墨写了一张大喜报，表达他们弟兄的心情。然后用很短时间，就近跑向报社，要求把他的喜报转送给毛主席。这时正是深夜，他在锣鼓声中，放大嗓门对那里的同志倾吐完他们弟兄的心情，然后才带着稍微安定下来的心情赶回医院看护病人。革命小将的热情像火一样热，他们身在病床边，心却为我们发射导弹核武器试验成功而欢跳，他们的心向着毛主席。
    一百颗“红花生”
    有一队外地的革命师生队伍读过大红喜报后，马上将一个大红纸包交给了中央接待站的负责人：“同志，请您把这个包转献给我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席吧！”
    打开包来，发现了一百颗壮实饱满的红花生！
    这是怎么回事？我们正在猜测的时候，又见包底叠着几封信。
    “毛主席呀毛主席，我们是多么向往北京，多么渴望能亲眼见到您老人家呵！我们多少年多少月，日日夜夜，时时刻刻地盼呀盼呀，终于，这幸福的一天，这难忘的一天来到了！我们四川一个农业中学选出的代表，来到了您老人家的身旁。在这里，我们又听到了我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息，我们该有多么高兴呀，多么幸福呀！我们受了全校革命师生的委托，把一百颗花生献给您。这花生，是我们自己开荒种出来的，是全校同学精选出来的三豆粒的大花生，请您老人家检阅学生‘以学为主，兼学别样’的成果；请您老人家尝尝，收下我们的心意。一百颗花生千百颗心，颗颗红心向着毛主席，向着北京城。”
    为中国红色的导弹核武器，向毛主席敬礼！
    十月二十八日，在人群似海、红旗如林的天安门广场狂欢的人流中，也有不少国际友人。其中有一位在欢呼这个大胜利之后，从人群中挤到天安门前面，停下了脚步。他深沉地仰望着毛主席巨幅画像，恭恭敬敬地鞠了一个躬，然后，满带笑容，离开了广场。
    在他那深沉望着毛主席巨像的眼里，蕴含了多少对毛主席的热爱！蕴含了多少对中国人民发射导弹核武器试验成功的欢乐喜悦呵！
    也就是在这一天，有一位在出版部门工作的外国专家，带着翻译，打着标语牌，拿着贺信，一边走，一边喊着口号，来到了党中央接待站。他心情激动地站在扩音器旁，大声地读着自己写的贺信，读完后，又挤入人群，同红卫兵一起拍照，并且用中国话大声呼喊：“热烈祝贺中国发射导弹核武器试验成功！”“毛泽东万岁，毛泽东万岁！”喊着喊着，他禁不住热泪涌出。他是为世界革命人民能有毛主席和中国而感到庆幸和高兴。欢腾的北京，这样充满革命的朝气，怎不使他这样感动呢？
