According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana, the editorial board of the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article on October 12 condemning the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in playing tricks with the "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue.

The article states that U.S. imperialism is using all means, using its puppets in Asia, using Wilson, Brown, the Pope, U Thant, Tito, Indira Gandhi, and others to serve its "peace talks" deception. The so-called "three-point proposal" for "establishing peace in Vietnam" thrown out by U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg at the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the proposals put forward by U Thant and British Foreign Minister Brown, are merely old plans with new packaging, with the same purpose of deceiving the Vietnamese people and attempting to trap them.

The article points out that the "cordial meeting" between Johnson, Rusk, and Gromyko during the United Nations General Assembly is another proof of further collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and another conspiracy between imperialism and revisionism. The U.S. and the Soviet Union continue to plot behind the backs of the Vietnamese people to deceive them with "peace talks."

According to a report from the New China News Agency on October 16, the Singapore Socialist Front's organ "Front Line" recently published a commentary pointing out that the "three-point proposal" thrown out by the United States on September 22 at the United Nations is another conspiracy by U.S. imperialism to stay in South Vietnam. The commentary severely refutes the logic of U.S. imperialism, stating that U.S. imperialism has invaded other people's territories, bombed and slaughtered the Vietnamese people without restraint, and still talks about asking the Vietnamese people to "stop counterattacking," which is truly outrageous.

Famous Burmese writer Du Amah published an article in the Burmese newspaper "People's News" on October 14, stating that Vietnam is a country that has been persistently resisting U.S. aggression. The United States is doing its utmost to destroy Vietnam, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and accept "peace talks" on its terms. In this situation, the Soviet Union "does not express sympathy and support for Vietnam, but instead winks and nods with the aggressor, the United States." She pointed out, "This is a betrayal of the people who are fighting."

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Brazzaville on October 16, the recent issue of the Congolese (Brazzaville) weekly "Independence" published an article condemning the U.S. conspiracy to escalate the war in Vietnam through the United Nations. The article refutes the so-called "three-point proposal" on the Vietnam issue thrown out by U.S. Representative Goldberg at the United Nations General Assembly on September 22, and points out that this proves that the Americans "still maintain their open looting mentality and actions. They continue to use the trick of the thief crying 'catch the thief'." The article states: "But they can no longer deceive anyone."

    各国舆论揭露帝修反群魔乱舞策划侵略越南的新阴谋
    美帝和谈骗局的新装潢掩不住旧圈套
    据新华社地拉那电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十二日发表编辑部文章，谴责美帝国主义和苏联修正主义互相勾结在越南问题上玩弄“和谈”阴谋。
    文章说，美帝国主义正在利用一切工具，利用在亚洲的傀儡，利用威尔逊、布朗、罗马教皇、吴丹、铁托、英迪拉·甘地等为它的“和谈”骗局效劳。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡在联合国大会抛出的所谓“建立越南和平”的“三点建议”以及吴丹和英国外长布朗提出的所谓建议，只不过是老计划新装潢，其目的仍然在于欺骗越南人民，妄图使越南人民落入圈套。
    文章指出，约翰逊、腊斯克和葛罗米柯在联合国大会期间的“亲切会晤”是美苏进一步勾结的又一证明，是帝国主义和修正主义的又一阴谋。美苏继续背着越南人民在策划反对越南人民的“和谈”阴谋。
    据新华社十六日讯  新加坡社会主义阵线机关报《阵线报》最近发表评论指出，美国九月二十二日在联合国抛出的“三点建议”是美帝国主义企图赖在南越不走的又一个阴谋。评论严厉驳斥美帝国主义的强盗逻辑说，美帝国主义侵略了别人的地方，肆无忌惮地狂轰滥炸、屠杀越南人民，还谈什么要越南人民“停止反击”，这真是岂有此理。
    著名的缅甸作家杜阿玛十四日在缅甸《人民报》上发表文章说，越南是坚持不懈地抗击美国侵略的一个国家。美国正在竭尽全力在越南进行破坏，妄图迫使越南人民屈服，按照它的条件接受“和谈”。在这种情况下，苏联“不对越南表示同情和声援，反而同侵略者美国眉来眼去”，她指出：“这是对正在进行斗争的人民的出卖。”
    据新华社布拉柴维尔十六日电　最近一期的刚果（布）《独立》周刊发表文章，谴责美国通过联合国加剧侵越战争的阴谋。文章驳斥了美国代表戈德堡九月二十二日在联合国大会上就越南问题抛出的美国的所谓“三点建议”，并且指出，这证明美国佬“仍然保持他们公开抢劫的强盗思想和行径。他们继续在玩弄贼喊捉贼的手法”。文章说：“但是，他们再也骗不了任何人。”
