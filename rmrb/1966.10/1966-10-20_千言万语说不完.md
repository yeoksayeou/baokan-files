	Red flags are as numerous as forests, and people are as vast as the sea.
	Revolutionary students and teachers are beaming with joy.
	Millions of hands wave the Little Red Book,
	The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echo across the four seas.
	At this moment of universal jubilation and boundless enthusiasm, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, arrived among us in an open-top car.
	Chairman Mao, with his radiant spirit, waved and greeted us repeatedly. We couldn't help but shout in unison: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! ... As we shouted, tears of joy streamed down our faces. The shouts of the people rolled like the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, my heart burned with passion, and a thousand words and ten thousand sentences surged into my mind like water bursting through a dam.
	Dear Chairman Mao, I was born into a poor peasant family. Before liberation, my family had no roof over our heads and no place to stand. All five of us often went hungry and cold, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. We endured, and endured, until 1949; we waited, and waited, until 1949. My hometown was finally liberated, and you, Chairman Mao, saved me from the sea of suffering and nurtured me from an ignorant child into a student of the people’s university ...
	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I have so much to tell you. But my heart, beating wildly, cannot calm down, and a thousand words and ten thousand sentences cannot be sorted out. I have only one thought: to forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, to be your little red soldier. I am determined to study and apply your works even more diligently, to firmly carry out the sixteen points that you personally presided over and formulated, to bring the precious experiences learned in Beijing to Hubei, to complete the glorious tasks of class struggle, criticism, and reform that you have entrusted to us, and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    千言万语说不完
    红旗如林人似海，
    革命师生笑颜开，
    千万只手挥语录，
    “毛主席万岁”的欢呼声震四海。
    就在这万众欢呼、热情奔放的时刻，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席身着草绿色军装，乘敞篷汽车来到了我们中间。
    毛主席，他老人家神采奕奕地向我们频频招手致意，我们不禁齐声欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！……喊着，喊着，一串串的热泪滚滚而出。人们的欢呼声，像那滚滚黄河、滔滔长江一样不断地翻滚，我的一颗火热的心几乎要跳出来，千言万语就像破了堤的水一样，一齐涌上心头。
    敬爱的毛主席，我出生在一个穷苦的贫农家庭里。解放前，我家上无片瓦，下无插针之地，全家五口人经常衣不暖体，食不饱肚，过着比牛马都不如的痛苦生活。熬啊，熬啊，总算熬到了一九四九年；盼啊，盼啊，总算盼到了一九四九年。我的家乡终于解放了，您老人家把我从苦海里救了出来，把我从一个无知的儿童培养成为一个人民的大学生……。
    毛主席啊，毛主席，我有多少话要向您倾吐。但我一颗剧烈跳动的心啊，怎么也不能平静，千言万语无法理出个头绪来。我只有一个心思：永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的红色小兵。我决心更加努力地活学活用您的著作，坚决执行您亲自主持制定的十六条，把从北京学到的宝贵经验带到湖北去，完成您交给我们的一斗二批三改的光荣任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
