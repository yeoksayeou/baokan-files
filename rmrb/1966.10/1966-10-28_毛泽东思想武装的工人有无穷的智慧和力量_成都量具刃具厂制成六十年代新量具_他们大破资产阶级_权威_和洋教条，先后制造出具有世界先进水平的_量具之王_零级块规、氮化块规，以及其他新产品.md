Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have limitless wisdom and power. The Chengdu Precision Tools Factory produced new precision tools in the 1960s. They broke through bourgeois "authorities" and foreign dogmas, successively manufacturing world-class precision tools such as the "king of precision tools," the zero-grade gauge block, and nitrided gauge blocks, as well as other new products.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on the 26th, the workers of the Chengdu Precision Tools Factory, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, broke through foreign frameworks and dogmas, and crushed the arrogance of bourgeois technical "authorities." With the courage to think, speak, venture, act, and revolutionize, they manufactured world-class precision tools such as the "king of precision tools," the zero-grade gauge block, and nitrided gauge blocks, as well as other new products.

The Chengdu Precision Tools Factory was built during the First Five-Year Plan. In the past, some bourgeois technical "authorities" clung to foreign frameworks, believing that foreign equipment could not be touched and that foreign-designed products and processes could not be changed. They only focused on "four percent" (completing four percent of the monthly plan each day), seeing things but not people, severely restricting the workers' enthusiasm and creativity in production.

The socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution greatly raised the class consciousness and revolutionary spirit of the workers. The entire factory launched a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works. They used Mao Zedong Thought to guide and solve problems in thought and production, using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize bourgeois ideology within the enterprise, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters. They dared to revolutionize and dared to compete with imperialism and revisionism, achieving one scientific and technological achievement after another.

In the past, the Chengdu Precision Tools Factory could only produce first and second-grade gauge blocks. In recent years, with the rapid development of China's industry and scientific research, there was an urgent need to produce higher-precision zero-grade gauge blocks. Could we produce zero-grade gauge blocks to meet the needs of the developing socialist construction? Bourgeois technical "authorities" said: No. Foreign countries took decades to produce them, and we have only been doing it for a few years, how could we expect to succeed overnight? We need to take it slow. However, a group of young workers in the gauge block workshop firmly answered: Yes! They said, "With Mao Zedong Thought, we can move mountains and fill seas, why worry about not getting zero-grade gauge blocks!" They experimented and explored, learning from Chairman Mao's works and summarizing experiences and lessons after each failure and encountering each problem. After hundreds of experiments, they finally produced zero-grade gauge blocks that could compete with the top products of capitalist countries. The workers were not satisfied with this; they continued to strive and successfully developed a new product of the 1960s—the nitrided gauge block.

This year, the state allocated a set of imported drill grinding machines from a capitalist country to the factory. After the machines arrived at the factory, the workers found that the technical documents were incomplete and wrote to the manufacturing factory to inquire. However, the reply exaggerated the machines, saying that only very intelligent people could master them and that they were prepared to send "experts" to help, along with a long list of conditions. The workers read the letter and were furious, saying, "We are Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought; no difficulty can make us bow our heads." The trial grinding team of workers and technicians, after just over two months of effort, not only mastered the machines but also modified the "foreign tiger," making it capable of grinding two types of high-speed steel with different properties instead of just one type as originally designed.

Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have limitless wisdom and power. Now, several types of products produced by this factory have undergone new changes: the design of vernier calipers and micrometers has been improved, the angles of milling cutters and reamers have been reformed, and drills, taps, and gear cutters have all been improved. The improved small vernier calipers reduced the weight from the original 366 grams to 180 grams, and the measuring tips were added with hard alloy, significantly extending their lifespan. At the same time, new products such as universal gear measuring instruments, precision levels, and lever micrometers began mass production.

    毛泽东思想武装的工人有无穷的智慧和力量
    成都量具刃具厂制成六十年代新量具
    他们大破资产阶级“权威”和洋教条，先后制造出具有世界先进水平的“量具之王”零级块规、氮化块规，以及其他新产品
    据新华社成都二十六日电　成都量具刃具厂广大职工以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，大破洋框框，洋教条，大灭资产阶级技术“权威”的威风，以敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢革命的英勇气概，制造出具有世界先进水平的“量具之王”零级块规、氮化块规以及其他新产品。
    成都量具刃具厂是在第一个五年计划期间建设起来的。过去，一些资产阶级技术“权威”抱着洋框框不放，认为外国设备动不得，外国设计的产品、工艺改不得。他们每天只抓“百分之四”（即每天完成月计划的百分之四），见物不见人，严重束缚了工人的生产积极性和创造性。
    社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命极大地提高了广大职工的阶级觉悟和革命热情。全厂掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮。他们用毛泽东思想指导和解决思想上、生产上的问题，用毛泽东思想批判企业中的资产阶级思想，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。他们敢于革命，敢于和帝国主义、修正主义较量，拿下了一项又一项科学技术成果。
    成都量具刃具厂过去只能生产一二级块规。近年来，随着我国工业和科学研究事业的大发展，迫切需要生产精度更高的零级块规。我们能不能生产出零级块规来满足日益发展的社会主义建设事业的需要呢？资产阶级技术“权威”说：不能。外国搞了几十年才生产出来，我们才干了几年，哪能一口吃成胖子，得慢慢来。但是，这个厂块规小组的几十个青年工人却果断地回答：能！他们说：“我们有了毛泽东思想，山能移、海能填，何愁零级块规不到手！”他们边试验、边摸索，每失败一次，每遇到一个问题，就学习毛主席著作，总结经验教训。经过上百次的试验，终于生产出了可以与资本主义国家王牌产品媲美的零级块规。职工们并不以此为满足，大家再接再厉，又试制成功了六十年代的新产品——氮化块规。
    今年一季度，国家拨给这个厂一套从资本主义国家进口的钻头轧机。机器运到工厂后，职工们发现技术资料不全，就写信去生产工厂询问。但对方回信中把这套机器吹嘘得神乎其神，说什么“要很聪明的人才能掌握”，并提出他们准备派“专家”来帮助，还提出一大堆条件。工人们读了这封信，肺都要气炸了，他们说，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人，没有困难能使我们低头。试轧小组的工人和技术人员，仅仅经过两个多月的努力，不仅熟练地掌握了这套机器，而且还给这个“洋老虎”动了“手术”，使它从原设计只能轧制一种韧性较好的高速钢，发展为可以轧制两种性能不同的高速钢。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，他们的智慧和力量是无穷无尽的。现在，这个厂生产的几类产品，都有了新的变化：千分尺、千分表的设计改进了，铣刀、绞刀的角度改革了，钻头、丝锥、板牙等都作了改进。改进后的小型千分尺重量由原来的三百六十六克下降到一百八十克，最易磨损的测头上加上硬质合金，大大延长了它的寿命。与此同时，万能测齿仪、精密水平仪、杠杆千分尺等新产品也开始成批生产。
