	Imperialism has always placed its hopes for a restoration on the young generation of China. Now, the young generation of China is becoming the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The hopes of imperialism and all the ghosts and monsters of various countries have been dashed, and they are now raving madly against the Red Guards.

	To us revolutionary people, the curses of the reactionaries against the Red Guards only make us feel the joy of victory and have firm confidence in China's future.

		Newspaper: *People's Forum* (Singapore)

	All revolutionary people of the world salute you, the young and brave Red Guards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Your resolute determination to eradicate reactionary culture is an inspiration to all the people of the world who are fighting. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards not only gain the support of the Chinese people but also the support of all progressive people of the world.

		Representative of the South West Africa People's Organization, Kanju

	The Red Guards are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards' resolute actions to smash old ideas and old customs are completely justified. The Red Guards are qualified successors of the Chinese revolution.

		Representative of the South West Africa People's Organization, Wei Yi

	The Red Guards are the genuine young generation defending Mao Zedong Thought.

		Representative of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, Xibei Ke

	The path taken by the Chinese Red Guards is correct. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will accelerate the socialist economic construction of this country.

		Sudanese educator, Hamid

	The Chinese Red Guards are truly excellent! Look, they are so brave and disciplined. Imperialism and all reactionaries are certainly very afraid of them, and therefore slander them.

		A journalist from Tanzania

	The task of the Chinese Red Guards is to eliminate old ideas and old culture, and cultivate new ideas and new culture. They are full of revolutionary passion and will surely achieve victory.

		Tanzanian Colonel, Himid

	The Red Guards are a "troop" in the Cultural Revolution, doing a lot of work and making great contributions. The Red Guards are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

		Leader of the Somali Cultural Delegation to China, Jama

    红卫兵赞
    帝国主义一直把复辟的希望寄托在中国年轻一代的身上。现在，中国年轻一代正在成为无产阶级革命事业的坚强可靠的接班人。帝国主义、各国的大小牛鬼蛇神的希望统统落空了，因此疯狂地咒骂起红卫兵来。
    对于我们革命的人民来讲，反动派对红卫兵的咒骂，只能使我们感到胜利的喜悦和对中国的未来具有坚强的信心。
                              新加坡《人民论坛》
    全世界的所有革命人民都向你们，向无产阶级文化大革命的年轻的英勇红卫兵致敬；你们根除反动文化的坚定决心是对全世界所有正在战斗的人民的鼓舞。红卫兵的革命行动不仅得到中国人民的支持，而且也得到世界所有进步人民的支持。
                    西南非洲民族联盟代表  坎朱
    红卫兵是文化大革命的先锋队。红卫兵大破旧思想、旧习惯的行动是完全正当的。红卫兵是中国革命的合格的接班人。
                    西南非洲民族联盟代表  维伊
    红卫兵是真正捍卫毛泽东思想的革命的年轻一代。
              阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会代表  西贝科
    中国红卫兵所走的道路是正确的。中国的文化大革命将加速这个国家的社会主义经济建设。
                          苏丹教育工作者  哈米德
    中国红卫兵真是好得很！你们看，他们是这样的英勇，这样的有纪律。帝国主义和一切反动派当然非常害怕他们，因而对他们进行诬蔑。
                          坦桑尼亚  一新闻工作者
    中国红卫兵要做的是消灭旧思想和旧文化，培育新思想和新文化。他们满怀革命的激情，他们一定会取得胜利。
                            坦桑尼亚  希米德上校
    红卫兵是文化大革命中的一支“军队”，他们作了很多工作，作出了很大贡献。红卫兵决心要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
                索马里访华文化代表团团长  贾马
