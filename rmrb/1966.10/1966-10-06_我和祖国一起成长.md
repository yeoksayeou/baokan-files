On October 1, 1949, the day after our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao announced to the world the founding of the People's Republic of China, I was born into a poor peasant family.

Over the past seventeen years, our great motherland, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has undergone tremendous changes. The motherland is becoming more prosperous and flourishing every day. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I have grown up healthily. On the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, representing the Uyghur people, came to the heart of the motherland—Beijing, stood by Chairman Mao's side to participate in the celebration activities. This is the most unforgettable moment in my life, the greatest happiness for the Uyghur people. I couldn't help but raise both hands and shout: Long live Chairman Mao!

On the evening of September 23, at around ten o'clock, I received the notice to go to Beijing to see the great leader Chairman Mao. At that moment, I was so excited that tears of joy streamed down my face. When the old poor peasants and revolutionary youths heard the news, they were also as excited as I was. Batch after batch, they came to instruct me: "Ask Chairman Mao how he is doing!" "Tell Chairman Mao that we Uyghur people will always follow him in revolution."

At the station, I asked my father, "Our village has undergone such great changes. When we go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, what should we say?" He pointed to the crops and said, "Before liberation, this was a vast wasteland, not a single grain was harvested; now, every year is a good year." He then pointed to the tractor station and said, "In recent years, the commune has tractors, seeders, rice hullers, built new houses, and even has a movie theater... All of this is done according to the path guided by Chairman Mao, listening to Chairman Mao's words."

The changes in the sky and on the earth are determined by the changes in people's thoughts. The changes in our hometown are the result of people's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, not only has the production landscape been changed, but it has also nurtured us, the revolutionary successors who are both literate and martial. We were born in the new society and have not gone through the severe trials of class struggle. We have studied more than ten articles written by Chairman Mao, such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Serve the People," and have only begun to understand some revolutionary truths.

During the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the nation, I saw the great Chairman Mao, heard the instructions from the central committee of the Party, and learned the advanced experiences from representatives of workers and peasants from various places. I will definitely share the happiness of seeing Chairman Mao and the revolutionary experiences I have learned with all the Uyghur people.

    我和祖国一起成长
    新疆米泉县金岗山公社社员　桂思木汉
    一九四九年十月一日，当我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席，向全世界宣告中华人民共和国成立的第二天，我出生在一个贫农的家庭里。
    十七年来，我们伟大祖国在毛主席的领导下，发生了翻天覆地的变化。祖国一天比一天繁荣昌盛。我在毛泽东思想抚育下也茁壮成长。在中华人民共和国成立十七周年的伟大节日里，我代表维吾尔族人民来到祖国的心脏——北京，站在毛主席身边参加庆祝活动。这是我一生中最难忘的时刻，是我们维吾尔族人民的最大幸福，我情不自禁地举双手高呼：毛主席万岁！
    九月二十三日晚上十点多钟，我接到了要我到北京去见伟大领袖毛主席的通知，当时我激动得落下了幸福的眼泪。老贫农和革命青年们知道这个消息以后，也都像我一样激动，一批又一批地前来嘱咐我：“亚夏松（毛主席）他老人家什么时候都想着咱们，你到北京要问他老人家好！”“告诉亚夏松，咱维吾尔族人民永远跟着他老人家闹革命。”
    在汽车站上，我问爸爸：“咱乡这么大的变化，到了北京见了毛主席，可从那说起呢？”他指指庄稼地说：解放前，这里是一片荒草原，不收一粒粮；现在，年年都是好年景。他又指着拖拉机站说：几年来，公社有了拖拉机、播种机、碾米机，盖了新房，还有电影院……，这都是按毛主席指引的道路，听了毛主席的话，办起来的。
    天变地变，决定于人的思想变。我们家乡的变化，是人们活学活用毛主席著作的结果。通过学习毛主席著作，不仅改变了生产面貌，还抚育出我们这些能文能武的革命接班人。我们生在新社会，没有经过严峻的阶级斗争锻炼。我们学习了毛主席写的《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等十几篇文章，才懂得了一些革命道理。
    在参加国庆十七周年的活动中，我见到了伟大的毛主席，听到了党中央负责同志的教导；我还学习了各地工农代表的先进经验，我一定把见到毛主席的幸福，和学到的革命经验，告诉所有的维吾尔族人民。
