Chairman Mao said: "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress."

Shanghai medical staff have once again created a new miracle in finger replantation. They have successfully replanted fourteen fingers for ten patients, keeping China's limb replantation surgery at the forefront internationally.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 25 — Shanghai's surgical medical staff, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have been practicing and advancing continuously. Following the success of hand replantation, they have once again created a new miracle in medical history by successfully using microvascular anastomosis to replant completely severed fingers, keeping China's limb replantation surgery at the forefront internationally.

Since last winter and this spring, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai First Medical College Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Institute of Orthopedics, and Shanghai Second Medical College's affiliated Dongfanghong (formerly Guangci) Hospital have all overcome the challenge of replanting severed fingers. So far, they have successfully replanted fourteen fingers for ten patients. Some patients' replanted fingers are regaining function, and some patients can already use their replanted fingers for labor. Last year, a young apprentice who successfully underwent finger replantation surgery wrote with his replanted thumb: "Study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good student of Chairman Mao." This expressed the young man's boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao.

The success of finger replantation surgery is a new victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Three years ago, Shanghai's surgical medical staff successfully replanted a worker's severed hand for the first time in the world. They decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, practice continuously, summarize experiences, strive for discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. Thus, the new task of replanting severed fingers was presented to Shanghai's surgical medical staff. However, their initial attempts at surgery all failed. Why couldn't the fingers be replanted? The surgical medical staff had various opinions. Some thought: the blood vessels in the fingers are too small, making them difficult to connect. Others said: after the fingers are severed, the blood vessels spasm, and to overcome this, one must study vascular physiology, but our current conditions are not sufficient. Some even thought: losing a hand is a big deal, but losing a finger is not. At this time, the hospital's party organization timely guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They used Chairman Mao's teachings to reflect on themselves, finding the root cause of the surgical failures: it was not a technical issue but a lack of deep class feelings for the workers and peasants, and a failure to establish a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people. In short, Mao Zedong Thought had not been truly mastered. After studying and discussing, everyone criticized the "it's just a finger, it doesn't matter" attitude of the bourgeoisie. They firmly stated: we are medical staff of the Mao Zedong era, servants of the workers and peasants, and we must thoroughly criticize all kinds of bourgeois thoughts, doing everything possible to replant severed fingers for the working people!

With Mao Zedong Thought leading the way, the courage, strength, and wisdom to overcome difficulties burst forth. The medical staff conducted a series of research and technical training on finger replantation. The first problem they needed to solve was suturing the small blood vessels of the severed fingers. The blood vessels in the fingers are much smaller than those in the arms, generally less than one millimeter in diameter, with the smallest being thinner than a needle. Doctors had to align the ends of the blood vessels, which were as thin as needles, and suture them without deviation, ensuring equal stitches and no bumps, otherwise, it would cause blood flow obstruction and surgical failure. This was a very difficult and meticulous task. How could one master the objective laws of suturing small blood vessels? Chairman Mao said: "Correct human thought can only come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice—production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." Based on this great directive, the doctors chose rabbit ear blood vessels, which are even smaller than finger blood vessels, to practice their skills. At the beginning, when suturing rabbit ear blood vessels, due to the vascular lumen shrinking and closing tightly, it was very difficult to pull them together for suturing. It took an entire afternoon to suture two blood vessels from cutting to completion. They used Chairman Mao's teachings, "carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," to urge themselves, enduring the dizziness and blurred vision caused by long hours of precise operations, and persisted in practicing until they finally developed a relatively ideal method for suturing small blood vessels.

Through continuous practice and summarizing experiences, Shanghai's surgical medical staff also broke the record in foreign medical literature that severed limbs cannot be replanted if the blood circulation is interrupted for more than six hours. They successfully applied the method of extending the preservation time of severed limbs in clinical practice, replanting fingers severed for twelve hours and arms severed for eighteen hours.

Shanghai's medical staff, who are actively participating in the current high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carry forward the daring and pioneering spirit of the proletarian revolution, remain humble and cautious, continue to advance, and strive to reach new heights in the field of medical science and technology.

### 上海医务人员又创断指再植新奇迹

    毛主席说：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”
    上海医务人员又创断指再植新奇迹
    为十位病人接活了十四个断指，使我国断肢再植手术在国际上一直领先
    新华社上海二十五日电　上海市外科医务人员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断实践，不断前进，继断手再植之后，又一次创造了世界医学史上的新奇迹——成功地运用小血管缝合方法接活了完全断离的手指，使我国断肢再植手术在国际上一直保持着领先的地位。
    去冬今春以来，上海市第六人民医院、上海第一医学院中山医院、上海市伤科研究所和上海第二医学院附属东方红（原广慈）医院都攻克了接活断手指这个医学科学上的又一个难关。到目前为止，他们已经为十位病人成功地接活了十四个断手指，有些病人接活了的手指的功能正在恢复，有些病人已能用接活的手指进行劳动了。去年接受断指再植手术并获得成功的是一位青年学徒工。他的右手拇指被轧断了。当他第一次用接活了的手指握笔的时候，兴奋地写下：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。”表达了这个青年人对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情。
    断指再植手术成功，是伟大的毛泽东思想的新胜利。三年前，上海的外科医务人员，在世界上第一次圆满成功地接活了一个工人的断手后，他们决心遵循毛主席的教导，不断实践，不断总结经验，力求做到有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。于是接活断手指的新课题就提到了上海市外科医务人员的面前。但他们开始时进行的几次手术，都失败了。断指为什么接不上去？外科医务人员中议论纷纷。有的认为：手指的血管太细，就是难接通。有的说：手指断了以后，血管会发生痉挛，要克服血管痉挛，必须研究血管生理，而我们现在的条件还不具备。有的甚至认为：没有手不行，缺一个手指头关系不大。这时候，医院的党组织及时引导大家学习毛主席的《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等著作，他们用毛主席的教导来对照自己，找出了手术失败的根本原因，不是什么技术问题，而是对工农群众缺乏深厚的阶级感情，没有树立起完全、彻底为人民服务的世界观，一句话，毛泽东思想没有真正学到手。经过学习讨论，大家批判了“缺一个手指头关系不大”的这种资产阶级老爷态度。他们坚决表示：我们是毛泽东时代的医务人员，是工农群众的勤务员，一定要彻底批判形形色色的资产阶级思想，要千方百计为劳动人民接活断指！
    毛泽东思想挂了帅，克服困难的勇气、力量和智慧就迸发出来了。医务人员进行了一系列断指再植的研究工作和技术训练。他们要解决的第一个难题是缝合断手指的小血管。手指的血管比手臂的血管小得多，直径一般都在一毫米以下，最小的血管比大头针还细。医生要把大头针一样粗细的血管断口对准之后，不偏不倚地缝合起来，针距要相等，不能有丝毫凹凸，否则会引起血流阻塞，导致手术失败。这是一件多么艰难、细致的工作，怎样才能掌握缝合小血管的客观规律？毛主席说：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”根据这个伟大指示，医生们选择了比手指血管更细的兔耳血管，苦练过硬本领。开始在兔耳血管上进行缝合时，由于血管管腔缩小紧闭，很难拉拢来缝合，两根血管从切断到缝合要花整整一个下午。他们用毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，鞭策自己，不顾长时间的精细操作而引起的头昏眼花，坚持练习，终于摸索出一套比较理想的小血管缝合方法。
    上海的外科医务人员经过不断地实践，不断地总结经验，还打破了国外医学文献上记录的所谓在临床上，血液循环中断超过六小时的断肢就无法接活的论断，成功地在临床上应用延长断肢保存时间的方法，接活了断离时间达十二小时的手指和断离十八小时的手臂。
    正在积极投入当前无产阶级文化大革命高潮中的上海市医务人员，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步发扬敢闯敢干的无产阶级革命精神，戒骄戒躁，继续前进，奋勇攀登医学科学技术领域的新高峰。（附图片）
