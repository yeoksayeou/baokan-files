Victory comes from Mao Zedong Thought!
A team of Red Guards from Jilin came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage.

Our country's missile and nuclear weapon test was successful! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses can overcome all difficulties and create miracles.

We came from the northeast of our motherland to the capital, to the center of the world revolution—Beijing. On October 18th, we received the inspection of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao. Our excitement has not yet subsided, and we received the inspiring news: our country's missile and nuclear weapon test was successful! When we heard the broadcast, we all jumped up in joy and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" Everyone quickly got dressed and rushed to find pens to write slogans. Red Guards with different accents ran and jumped, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" In a short time, cheers, drumbeats, and the resounding song "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman" filled the air. Slogans celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought were posted all over the campus, and the entire residential area was in an uproar. Revolutionary students and teachers from all over the country gathered into a long procession, marching towards the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to express their congratulations to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At this time, the reception station had already become a sea of joy, and people from all directions rushed towards the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The principles of Marxism are numerous, but in the final analysis, it is just one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" Led by the United States, imperialists blockade us, and modern revisionists led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union collude with the American imperialists, intensifying their efforts to implement nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. This cannot intimidate us. The people armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought are daring to rebel, to rebel against imperialism, and to rebel against revisionism. Great! Our red missile and nuclear weapons are a great victory in rebelling against imperialism and revisionism.

The great fire of the Cultural Revolution personally ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao is burning more fiercely, and the situation is excellent! The American imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries are sparing no effort to slander our Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We have the most powerful and sharpest weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. We are fearless of heaven and earth, daring to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea! We will temper and transform ourselves in the great Cultural Revolution, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and strive to study Chairman Mao's works. We will raise the level of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, promote our own ideological revolutionization, and remember Chairman Mao's teachings to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal red sun!

    胜利来自毛泽东思想
    吉林来京革命串连的一队红卫兵
    我国发射导弹核武器试验成功了！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。革命群众有了毛泽东思想，就能战胜一切困难，就能创造奇迹。
    我们从祖国的东北来到首都，来到世界革命的中心——北京。十月十八日接受了伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的检阅，兴奋的心情还没平静，又传来了振奋人心的消息：我国发射导弹核武器试验成功了！当我们听到广播以后，都高兴得跳了起来，齐声欢呼“毛主席万岁！”大家穿好衣服就急忙找笔写标语。操着不同口音的红卫兵，奔跑着、跳跃着，欢呼“毛主席万岁！”不一会儿，欢呼声、锣鼓声和“大海航行靠舵手”的宏亮歌声响成一片，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想伟大胜利的巨幅标语贴满校园，整个居住地区沸腾起来了。来自五湖四海的革命师生汇集成一支长长的队伍，浩浩荡荡奔向中共中央接待站，向党中央、向毛主席表示庆贺。此时接待站早已成为欢腾的海洋，各路人流都奔向一个方向，向着党中央，向着毛主席！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”以美国为首的帝国主义封锁我们，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者又和美帝狼狈为奸，加紧勾结，企图实行核垄断和核讹诈。这并不能吓倒我们。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，就是敢造反，造帝国主义的反，造修正主义的反。好啊，我们的红色导弹核武器，你是中国人民造帝国主义的反，造修正主义的反的伟大胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命之火，越烧越旺，形势好得很！美帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，挖空心思污蔑我国无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们是毛主席的红卫兵，我们有毛泽东思想这个最强大、最锐利的思想武器，天不怕、地不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯！我们要在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼自己，改造自己，向解放军学习，努力学习毛主席著作，把活学活用毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段，促进自己的思想革命化，记住毛主席的教导，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛泽东思想是永远不落的红太阳！
