The proletarian internationalist friendship between Tanzanian workers and Chinese workers and experts, forged through common labor and shared living, shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

An old worker named Rashid, who installs water pipes, shared a vivid contrast from his personal experience. He said that he has been doing water pipe installation for eighteen years. In the past, technicians from colonialist countries did not genuinely help them; they never allowed them to see the blueprints. Whenever it came to the critical moment in installing water pipes, they would send them away to do odd jobs. Now, Chinese experts not only let them see the blueprints but also systematically teach them, sharing all their technical knowledge without reservation, enabling them to master the entire process of water pipe installation. The old worker excitedly said, "The Chinese experts taught by Chairman Mao are dedicated to serving the working people of the world."

An African cook who worked with Chinese survey experts said that during the more than ten years he worked for Western experts, he had endured much discrimination and coldness. Now, working with Chinese experts, he receives respect and warm care. Chinese experts often cook with him and eat at the same table. When he was sick, the Chinese experts even fed him medicine and took meticulous care of him. The sincere comradely friendship and warm brotherly care from the Chinese experts deeply moved him. He requested that the Chinese experts give him a Mao Zedong badge. When he received the badge, he excitedly said, "I will forever wear Chairman Mao's portrait on my chest and never forget Chairman Mao and the Chinese experts taught by Chairman Mao."

    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的友谊
    坦桑尼亚工人热爱毛主席派去的中国工人和专家
    坦桑尼亚工人同中国工人、专家在共同劳动和共同生活中，结下了深厚的无产阶级国际主义的友谊。这个友谊闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    一位名叫拉什迪的安装水管的老工人，谈了他的一段鲜明对比的亲身经历：他说，他干安装水管这项活已经十八年了。从前，殖民主义国家技术人员不是真心帮助他们，从来不让他们看图纸，每次在安装水管的关键时刻，就把他们支开去干杂活。而现在，中国专家不仅让他们看图纸，而且还系统地给他们讲课，毫无保留地把技术传授给他们，使他们掌握了安装水管的全部技术。这位老工人激动地说，“毛主席教导的中国专家是全心全意为全世界劳动人民服务的。”
    一位同中国勘探专家一道工作的非洲厨师说，他过去在为西方专家工作的十多年中，曾受尽了歧视和冷淡。现在，在同中国专家一道工作的日子里，他受到的却是尊重和热情的关怀。中国专家经常同他一起做饭，同他一桌吃饭。在他生病的时候，中国专家还给他喂药，无微不至地照顾他。中国专家这种同志般的真挚友谊和兄弟般的亲切关怀使他深受感动。他要求中国专家送给他一枚毛主席像纪念章。他得到纪念章时激动地说，我要永远把毛主席像佩带在胸前，永远不忘毛主席和毛主席教导的中国专家。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
