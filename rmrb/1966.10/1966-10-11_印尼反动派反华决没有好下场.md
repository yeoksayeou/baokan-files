The Guanghua ship dispatched by our government has already brought back over a thousand overseas Chinese who were persecuted by the Indonesian reactionaries to their homeland. This is a victory achieved by our overseas Chinese, with the support of their motherland, in their resolute struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries.

	The Crimes of the Indonesian Reactionaries

Since the Indonesian reactionaries carried out their fascist military coup, they have launched a frenzied attack on the people, conducting a bloody massacre of progressive individuals and Communist Party members. At the same time, the Indonesian reactionaries have engaged in extensive anti-China activities and brutally persecuted overseas Chinese.

	From last October to now, the Indonesian reactionaries have repeatedly slandered and attacked our country. They have sent thugs and even the military to attack our embassy, consulates, and other facilities over twenty times, injuring more than forty of our diplomatic personnel, staff, and journalists, and looting and destroying many items. Ten buildings of our diplomatic missions and the Xinhua News Agency branch have now been seized by the reactionaries.

	The Indonesian reactionaries have also colluded with the Kuomintang bandits to persecute overseas Chinese nationwide. They have set fire to overseas Chinese shops and homes, looted their belongings, and brutally killed many overseas Chinese. The reactionaries have also ordered the dissolution of overseas Chinese organizations, closed overseas Chinese schools and newspapers. Now, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese face extremely difficult living conditions and have no guarantee of safety.

	Chairman Mao said as early as 1949: "Our nation will no longer be a nation that is bullied by others. We have stood up." Our government and people cannot tolerate the persecution of our overseas citizens by the Indonesian reactionaries. Our powerful motherland is the backbone of the overseas Chinese. Our government has resolutely fought against the Indonesian reactionaries and finally brought back the first batch of overseas Chinese who requested to return to the country.

	The Indonesian Reactionaries Are Running Dogs of the U.S. Imperialists

	The anti-China tide that has emerged in Indonesia is part of the international anti-China tide instigated by U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries.

	The right-wing military clique in Indonesia is a running dog of U.S. imperialism. They seized power and persecuted the people domestically, all under the orders of U.S. imperialism. After they came to power, U.S. imperialism immediately rewarded them with fifty thousand tons of rice and over one hundred million dollars in loans. They also, under U.S. command, stopped their opposition to the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" and decided to rejoin the United Nations to act as a tool for the United States.

	The Indonesian reactionaries also have close ties with other U.S. puppets and accomplices. They have borrowed large sums of money from the Japanese Sato government and the Indian reactionary government. They plan to establish "diplomatic" relations with the U.S. puppet in South Korea and the Kuomintang bandits. They have close relations with the reactionaries in Thailand and the Philippines and plan to form some kind of "Southeast Asian Nations Alliance" with them.

	The Indonesian reactionaries also have close ties with the Soviet revisionist leadership and are preparing to send Foreign Minister Malik to the Soviet Union. They have also established relations with the Tito clique in Yugoslavia.

	The Indonesian People Want Friendship with China

	All reactionaries in the world always end up hurting themselves. The right-wing military regime in Indonesia, following the lead of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism in their frenzied anti-China activities, will not end well.

	Chairman Mao said: "All the people of the world are our friends; imperialism and its running dogs are our common enemies, but they are very few in number." In the world, only a small handful of people are anti-China. In Indonesia, only a small handful of people are anti-China.

	The Indonesian people have a traditional friendship with the Chinese people. The Indonesian people and the overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia have long been united in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, forming a deep bond of friendship. The right-wing military clique in Indonesia's frenzied anti-China activities are completely against the wishes of the broad masses of the Indonesian people. Although the Indonesian reactionaries are carrying out bloody repression domestically, revolutionary struggles against the right-wing military regime are constantly emerging in various places. The revolutionary people of Indonesia will definitely rise up to overthrow the fascist military regime, demand justice for the massacre of their people, and also settle accounts for their anti-China crimes. The traditional friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people will definitely be restored and developed.

### 印尼反动派反华决没有好下场

    印尼反动派反华决没有好下场
    我国政府派出的光华轮，已经把一千多名受印度尼西亚反动派迫害的华侨接回祖国。这是我国侨胞在祖国支持下同印度尼西亚反动派进行了坚决斗争而取得的一个胜利。
      印尼反动派的反华罪行
    印度尼西亚反动派实行法西斯军事政变以来，向人民发动疯狂进攻，对进步人士和共产党员进行了血腥的大屠杀。在这同时，印度尼西亚反动派又大肆进行反华活动，并且疯狂地迫害华侨。
    从去年十月到现在，印度尼西亚反动派不断对我国进行污蔑和攻击，并且派出流氓甚至军队，对我国大使馆、领事馆等进行了二十多次袭击，打伤我国外交官员、工作人员和记者四十多人，抢走并破坏了许多东西。我国外交机构和新华社分社的十处房子，现在都被反动派霸占着。
    印度尼西亚反动派还勾结蒋帮分子，在全国疯狂迫害华侨。他们放火烧掉华侨的商店和房子，抢华侨的东西，残酷地杀死了许多华侨。反动派还下令解散华侨团体，封闭华侨学校和报纸。现在，成千上万的华侨，生活非常困难，生命也没有保障。
    毛主席早在一九四九年就说过：“我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。”我国政府和人民决不能容忍印度尼西亚反动派迫害我国侨民。我们强大的祖国是华侨的靠山。我国政府同印度尼西亚反动派进行了坚决斗争，终于接回了第一批要求回国的华侨。
      印尼反动派是美帝的走狗
    在印度尼西亚出现的这股反华逆流，是美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起的国际反华逆流的一个组成部分。
    印度尼西亚右派军人集团是美帝国主义的走狗。他们在国内篡夺政权、迫害人民，都是在美帝国主义指使下干的。在他们当政以后，美帝国主义马上就赏给他们五万吨大米，一亿多美元贷款。他们还按照美国的指挥，停止了同新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”的对抗，决定印度尼西亚重新回到联合国，在联合国里给美国充当工具。
    印度尼西亚反动派同美国的其它走狗、帮凶也勾搭得很紧。它向日本佐藤政府和印度反动政府借了许多钱。它打算同南朝鲜的美国傀儡和蒋匪帮建立“外交”关系。它同泰国、菲律宾的反动派打得火热，要同它们一起拼凑什么“东南亚国家合作联盟”。
    印度尼西亚反动派同苏联修正主义领导集团关系很密切，还准备派外交部长马利克到苏联去。它同南斯拉夫铁托集团也拉上了关系。
      印尼人民要求同中国友好
    世界上一切反动派总是搬起石头砸自己的脚。印度尼西亚右派军人政权跟着美帝国主义和现代修正主义猖狂反华，决不会有什么好下场。
    毛主席说过：“全世界的人民都是中国人民的朋友；帝国主义以及他们的走狗则是我们的共同敌人，但是他们的人数很少。”在世界上，反华的只是一小撮人。在印度尼西亚，反华的也只是一小撮人。
    印度尼西亚人民同中国人民有着传统的友谊。印度尼西亚人民同旅居印度尼西亚的华侨，长期来在反帝反殖的共同斗争中更是结成了深厚的战斗友谊。印度尼西亚右派军人集团猖狂进行反华活动，是完全违反印度尼西亚广大人民愿望的。尽管印度尼西亚反动派在国内进行血腥镇压，但是各地不断出现革命人民反对右派军人政权的斗争。印度尼西亚的革命人民一定要起来推翻法西斯军事政权，讨还他们屠杀国内人民的血债，同时也要清算他们的反华罪行。印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的传统友谊一定会重新得到恢复和发展。
