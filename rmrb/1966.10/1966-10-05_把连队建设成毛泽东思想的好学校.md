Building the Company into a Good School of Mao Zedong Thought

Deputy Director of the Political Department of a Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Former Political Commissar of the Red Ninth Company, Chen Jinyuan

In February 1949, Chairman Mao wrote in "Transforming the Army into a Work Team": "The army is a school. Two million one hundred thousand troops are equivalent to thousands of universities and colleges. All cadres mainly rely on the army itself to solve the problem." Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school. We understand that to make the army into a great school, the most fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm people, to cultivate revolutionaries with communist consciousness.

Our company is a Red Army company personally established by Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan. From the day it was born, it has been a revolutionary furnace under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought. Our predecessors, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have cultivated many outstanding revolutionary cadres and heroic revolutionary soldiers in the long-term revolutionary struggle, and have established immortal merits for the people.

In July 1961, when Comrade Lin Biao inspected our unit, he pointed out: "A good company is a school, and the Ninth Company is a good school." Comrade Lin Biao's instructions greatly encouraged us and gave us boundless confidence and strength. In recent years, we have followed Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisted on the Four Firsts, strengthened political and ideological work, and grasped the transformation of worldviews. This has further promoted the glorious traditions of the company and strengthened the role of the revolutionary furnace. Batch after batch of ordinary young people from villages, factories, and schools have quickly grown into conscious revolutionary soldiers under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Since 1961, 175 model and active study-and-apply-Chairman-Mao's-works activists have emerged, 110 soldiers have joined the Communist Party of China, and 21 have been promoted to cadres. Because Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in the minds of many soldiers, after they are demobilized, they can also insist on studying and spreading Mao Zedong Thought. Many of them can play the role of "red seeds." The construction of the company has been strengthened year by year, and it has been consecutively rated as a Four-Good Company for five years. In 1964, the Ministry of National Defense awarded us the title of "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works."

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Cultivate People Is the Foundation of All Work

Before 1959, the cadres of our company also wanted to do a good job. However, the direction was unclear, and they spent all day running in circles on military training, squad life, and cleanliness and hygiene. They focused more on administrative work and less on political and ideological work, focusing on things rather than people. There were many problems in the company. Some people said that the situation at that time was "neat interior, disunited hearts." We few cadres were very anxious.

In 1959, Comrade Lin Biao published the article "Hoisting High the Red Flag of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong's Military Thought and Marching Forward in Big Strides." Comrade Lin Biao said: "Equipment and technology are indeed important, but the human factor is more important. Technology is also something that people have to master. People and things should be unified, and people should be the leading factor." He also said: "In the new historical period, political work and ideological work in the army are very important and must not be relaxed. ... Politics is the most fundamental thing. If political work and ideological work are not done well, then all other work is out of the question." Comrade Lin Biao's words clearly pointed out the problems of the company. At the party branch meeting, I introduced Comrade Lin Biao's article to everyone and studied with everyone the section on "military absolutism" in the resolution of the Gutian Conference drafted by Chairman Mao. After full discussion, we decided to organize the company to seriously study Chairman Mao's works and grasp the ideological education of people.

Soon, our Ninth Company was to have a tug-of-war competition with the Fifth Company. The Fifth Company was the tug-of-war champion of the 1955 Beijing Military Games. When many people heard that they were to compete with the Fifth Company, they lost heart and said, "It's impossible to defeat the big guys of the Fifth Company." We organized the study of Chairman Mao's statements on subjective initiative in response to this lack of confidence. The tug-of-war team studied and practiced simultaneously, becoming more enthusiastic the more they studied. The result was that the Ninth Company won. The Fifth Company was not convinced, so both sides agreed to compete again during the Spring Festival. The Fifth Company was very enthusiastic and practiced at night, tying one end of the rope to a big tree and pulling on the tree. Our tug-of-war team saw this and analyzed it using Chairman Mao's statements on subjective initiative: "A tree is a lifeless thing. Practicing like this does not train people's abilities well, and there is no guarantee of how much the tug-of-war ability has improved. We cannot pull a dead tree; we have to pull a living person." Based on everyone's opinions, we selected 30 soldiers to practice with 25 tug-of-war team members. During the practice, the number of soldiers gradually increased, and later, 25 people could confidently pull over 33 people. During the Spring Festival competition, our tug-of-war team won again with a score of 3-0. Where did our strength come from? The tug-of-war team members said: This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's teachings, and the result of exerting subjective initiative. The cadres also saw the immense power of using Mao Zedong Thought to unify people's thoughts and saw that as long as people's enthusiasm is fully mobilized, miracles that one cannot even imagine can be created.

After a while, we went to build a reservoir and found that some old soldiers were not in high spirits. Upon investigation, the main reason was that they could not correctly handle the issue of joining the Party and the League. For example, the seventh platoon leader said: "Progress or not mainly depends on the leadership. Who the leadership cultivates, that person progresses quickly." Some old soldiers, because of this ideological problem, not only did not play a leading role in labor but also affected the morale of the new soldiers.

After research, we decided to study Chairman Mao's instructions on the relationship between internal and external factors to solve the problem of emphasizing external factors and not valuing subjective efforts. Chairman Mao said: "Dialectical materialism holds that external factors are conditions for change, and internal factors are the basis for change. External factors act through internal factors." In the discussion, the seventh platoon leader said: "In my opinion, the fundamental reason for a person's progress is external factors. The company is like a furnace, the soldier is like ore, and the leadership is like a worker. No matter how good the ore is, if the leadership does not light the fire for you, you will not become steel no matter how hard you try." Several people agreed with his opinion, but many comrades did not agree with this view. Eighth platoon soldier Li Zhihua said: "It is one-sided to emphasize external factors. A person's progress, although external factors are important, is more important internally. We should not forget that people are living ore. If you do not actively come into contact with the fire, always afraid of being burned, I think you will never become steel in your life." After a heated debate, it was unanimously agreed: External factors are the conditions for progress, internal factors are the fundamental factors for progress, and external factors act through internal factors. The seventh platoon leader's mind was greatly opened, and from then on, he studied and worked very well, receiving two advanced production awards. He deeply felt: Emphasizing external factors brings suffering, emphasizing internal factors brings sweetness. Later, he joined the Communist Party of China.

This study of Chairman Mao's works solved the ideological problems of the old soldiers, and the new soldiers also received an education, which strongly promoted the completion of the construction task. We further realized that the work of grasping people is to grasp the transformation of their worldviews. Only when ideological problems are solved can people's initiative and enthusiasm be fully brought into play.

In 1960, Comrade Lin Biao personally presided over an enlarged meeting of the Military Commission and formulated the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army." The resolution emphasized the Four Firsts, calling for the high holding of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and insisting on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead in all work. The resolution pointed out: "Only through strong political and ideological work can the political awareness of the broad masses of officers and soldiers be raised, inspire people's courage and tenacity, and bring into full play people's high initiative and initiative, so that we can always stand unshakable." These words we felt particularly close. The more we studied, the clearer our minds became, the clearer our direction became, and the more determined we were to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate and cultivate people. We decided to firmly follow the direction indicated by the Military Commission resolution and continue to move forward, letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in the Ninth Company and become a treasure to be passed down from generation to generation.

What is the most fundamental thing to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate and cultivate people? We have realized in practice that the most fundamental thing is to grasp the education of class and class struggle.

In 1961 and 1962, the company recruited two batches of urban youth soldiers. They were enthusiastic, had a strong sense of progress, and quickly learned new things, adding new strength to the unit. However, they also brought some new problems. For example, some sought personal fame and profit, thinking that being an infantryman was a waste of talent. Some did not obey the leadership, had poor organizational discipline, and some sought enjoyment in life.

These young soldiers were mostly children of workers and peasants, with relatively pure thoughts, but they had not experienced the hardships of the old society's laboring people. Although they lived in happiness, they were not content, always looking at the grass on the other side of the fence, not knowing the great cause of class and the needs of the revolution. As Comrade Lin Biao said: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, then you do not understand revolution." If we do not give the young soldiers this lesson on class struggle, they will not be able to truly study Mao Zedong Thought, and their thoughts will have no basis. Therefore, we emphasized class education, studied articles such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," organized visits to the poor and investigations of soldiers' family histories, and inspired soldiers to recall bitterness and sweetness, raising their class consciousness. Through education, the revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works were greatly aroused. Many soldiers deeply examined their erroneous thoughts and expressed their determination to remember class bitterness, to be good ordinary soldiers, and to serve the people wholeheartedly.

Later, ideological problems still emerged among the soldiers, and some problems could not be solved. Just at this time, Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, issued the great call to never forget class struggle. We seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions and, in conjunction with reviewing the resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, realized that class struggle in society must be reflected within the unit, and the influence of bourgeois ideology on soldiers is still widespread. To strengthen realistic class education, we mobilized everyone to expose the enemy situation, invited cadres from nearby communes to introduce the class struggle situation in the countryside, so that soldiers saw the evil face of the class enemy and raised their class vigilance. We also often conducted "investigations of the enemy situation," grasped living targets, and let everyone use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and criticize, solve their own problems, and transform their worldviews.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of soldiers, making them have a solid class struggle consciousness, and a clear distinction between enemies and ourselves is the basic course of the revolution. This course must be grasped, otherwise, serious mistakes will be made. Only by understanding class struggle can one clearly see where one's ideological problems come from and how they will develop, and only then can one consciously study Chairman Mao's works, eliminate the influence of old thoughts, and enhance immunity.

Using the Small Rectification Method to Study Chairman Mao's Works and Inspire Soldiers to Revolutionize Consciously

For the problems in the soldiers' minds, that is, the infiltration of various old thoughts, in addition to guiding them to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in participating in social class struggle and gradually eliminating the influence of old thoughts, we also, according to Chairman Mao's instructions on rectification, infused the spirit of rectification into the regular study of Chairman Mao's works, inspiring soldiers to consciously revolutionize, overcoming various non-proletarian thoughts, and gradually establishing a proletarian worldview.

We saw that soldiers, on the one hand, were receiving socialist ideological education, and on the other hand, were influenced by bourgeois ideology, so their minds had "liberated areas" and also "enemy-occupied areas," had "red areas" and also "white areas." Chairman Mao said: "In all processes, the conflicting aspects are originally mutually exclusive, mutually struggling, and mutually opposed." New and old thoughts "living together," if you do not eat it, it will eat you, and it will not coexist peacefully. In doing ideological work, we must adopt an offensive posture, actively struggle against various erroneous thoughts, and liberate the positions in soldiers' minds occupied by old thoughts, infusing new communist thoughts.

Chairman Mao said: "The fundamental cause of the development of things is not in the external things but in the internal things, in the internal contradictions of things." Transforming soldiers' thoughts is also determined by internal factors, and it must rely on soldiers to consciously revolutionize. The responsibility of the leadership is to create external conditions, mobilize the positive factors in soldiers' minds to overcome negative factors, and promote them to consciously engage in ideological struggle, using soldiers' words, called "fighting" between new and old thoughts.

Using the small rectification method to study Chairman Mao's works is a good method to guide soldiers to consciously revolutionize. This method is gradually explored in the process of implementing the principle of studying with problems, actively studying and applying, combining study with use, and learning first what is urgently needed, as proposed by Comrade Lin Biao. Chairman Mao said: "Rectification is for the whole party to learn Marxism through criticism and self-criticism. In the process of rectification, we will definitely learn more Marxism." Small rectification is to infuse the spirit of rectification into a regular form, as a regular form of studying Chairman Mao's works to transform thoughts. Its basic spirit is to mobilize positive factors, inspire conscious revolution, uproot bourgeois ideology, and plant Mao Zedong Thought.

In the small rectification, how to mobilize positive factors and inspire the masses to consciously revolutionize?

First, infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the minds of soldiers.

To make the correct thoughts in soldiers' minds defeat erroneous thoughts, the most fundamental thing is to guide them to study Chairman Mao's works, infuse Mao Zedong Thought into their minds, and strengthen their internal positive factors. Once soldiers' minds have Mao Zedong Thought, they will have a standard to distinguish right from wrong and a weapon to fight with, and various non-proletarian thoughts will be eaten away one by one.

In the small rectification, we infused Mao Zedong Thought by studying one basic viewpoint at a time, repeatedly studying it deeply. We also studied entire articles, but we focused on basic viewpoints. Studying an article is to find the stance, viewpoint, and method to solve problems from the article; studying a viewpoint can bring the article, mastering the basic viewpoint can better understand the spirit and essence of the entire article. Truly mastering a viewpoint can solve a series of problems. Soldiers said: Mastering a viewpoint can be used for a lifetime. Day by day, month by month, some basic viewpoints learned can be integrated and strung together, gradually truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought. In recent years, we have used the small rectification method to organize everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's basic viewpoints on class struggle, people's war, emphasizing politics, serving the people, hard struggle, two leaps, etc., breaking down bourgeois ideology and establishing Mao Zedong Thought.

Second, grasp the "key" active thoughts.

The struggle between the two kinds of thoughts in soldiers' minds is like a battle between two armies. In this "battle," on the one hand, we must arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, raise their original naive class consciousness to a conscious level, and create an advantage for proletarian thoughts; on the other hand, we must make them recognize their erroneous thoughts, find the "enemy," so that they can know both themselves and the enemy, win a battle, and win a battle.

Helping soldiers find the problem cannot be done by discussing specific problems, but by grasping the root of their thoughts. Each soldier's ideological problem is not accidental but has deep class roots. This is the reflection of social class struggle in soldiers' minds, which we call "key" active thoughts. Grasping the "key" active thoughts well, the problem is solved deeply, and the worldview can be fundamentally strengthened; if not grasped well, the problem is solved shallowly, like "weeding without uprooting, spring comes back green." Of course, the transformation of soldiers' worldviews cannot be completed in one grasp, but grasping the "key" active thoughts, grasping once, can have a leap in ideological revolutionization; repeatedly grasping, the proletarian thought position in soldiers' minds can be gradually expanded, and the territory of bourgeois ideology will be gradually squeezed out.

Third, guide soldiers to summarize the experience of transforming thoughts.

Using the method of summarizing experience to study Chairman Mao's works is the basic form we use in small rectification to inspire soldiers to consciously revolutionize. This method can best mobilize soldiers' initiative in transforming thoughts and best inspire soldiers to engage in the struggle between new and old thoughts. To summarize well, one must study well and use well, combining study with use, linking thoughts for comparison and analysis, finding experiences and lessons. In this way, it will definitely cause a "fight" between the two kinds of thoughts in the mind. The fourth platoon has a soldier who, at the beginning of studying Chairman Mao's works, had a poor conscious revolutionary spirit, saying one thing and doing another. For example, after studying the viewpoint of "two aspects," I told him: Use the viewpoint of "two aspects" to summarize your thoughts well. He was very happy and went back to write all his advantages on paper, but after thinking about it, he felt something was wrong. He thought, the platoon leader asked me to summarize my experience of studying the viewpoint of "two aspects," and I only found advantages, isn't this one-sided? Thus, he engaged in a "fight" between new and old thoughts, using the viewpoint of "two aspects" to fully analyze his advantages and disadvantages. He further used the viewpoint of "two aspects" to find the advantages of all his platoon mates and compared himself, finding eight gaps, and one by one overcame them in action, making rapid progress in his thoughts. In summarizing his experience, he said: "Studying 'two aspects' requires learning to distinguish and more importantly, learning to struggle. Only by distinguishing can one see the advanced thoughts and backward thoughts in one's mind; only by struggling can one use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome one's backward thoughts."

Guiding soldiers to summarize the experience of transforming thoughts not only enhances the spirit of conscious revolution but also overcomes the habit of generalizing learning, making knowledge deepen continuously, and making the roots of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind deeper and deeper. Comrades reflected: Summarizing experience gave us a signpost, knowing the next step to take.

Fourth, use typical examples to lead the way.

Using typical examples to lead the way is an active and good method to promote soldiers to consciously revolutionize. For example, in 1963, during the small rectification of "digging out non-proletarian ideological imprints," some comrades did not dare to openly express their thoughts, fearing embarrassment and pain. We first let a comrade who had done well in expressing thoughts introduce his own non-proletarian ideological imprints. He said: "After graduating from high school, I wanted to apply to the Music Academy and become a musician in the future. After enlisting, I could not put down this burden, feeling that I had suffered a loss by enlisting, thinking that my dream of becoming a musician was over. Where did this thought come from? Mainly it was influenced by the old thoughts at home. On the day before my mother died, she still told me, 'Your voice is very good, and you love music. Study hard and strive to become a musician in the future.' My mother has been dead for three years, but her words are still deeply ingrained in my mind. Only now do I realize that this is the injection of non-proletarian ideology into me, not to make me a cultured ordinary worker, peasant, or soldier, but to make me famous and successful. I must resolutely uproot this bourgeois individualist ideological imprint." His introduction inspired many comrades. Following this, the whole company launched an active activity to consciously uproot non-proletarian ideological imprints.

We realized that using typical examples to lead the way can set up a living opposite in people's minds, making everyone see the difference, find the gap, clarify the direction, and cause a struggle between the opposites in the mind. As long as a typical example is presented, it can break the calm, open up the mind, and make many people sit up and think, engaging in a "fight" between new and old thoughts.

In the execution of various tasks, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's worldviews

Can people's worldviews be transformed in the process of completing various tasks? This question was clarified by us through a period of practice. At first, when we engaged in training, we only thought about shooting; when we engaged in construction, we only thought about stones; when we engaged in production, we only thought about grain. It seemed that executing tasks could only be about these things. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's words: "Studying Marxism, not only from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can truly learn Marxism." We realized that the process of executing various tasks is a good opportunity to study Mao Zedong Thought and transform people's worldviews. From analyzing the situation of some comrades, we saw that in work practice, people's worldviews are not naturally transformed. Those who have made progress are all the result of paying attention to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This means that the proletarian worldview must be consciously practiced and transformed under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to gradually establish itself. If in the process of completing tasks, we neglect the study of Chairman Mao's works and lose the ideological weapon to guide practice, then people's thoughts will not be transformed.

In the process of executing tasks, we grasp the transformation of soldiers' worldviews, which is to make soldiers strive to study Chairman Mao's works, solve real ideological problems, guide actions, and temper thoughts in work practice; on the basis of practice, again use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the summary, further enriching thoughts. This is what we often say, the "leap" in thoughts.

Once, our company engaged in construction, and the main task was to dredge sand. New soldier Wang Yongtian was a student soldier from the city who had never participated in labor at home. On the first day, he was assigned to carry sand, and a blister the size of an egg yolk appeared on his shoulder, causing his waist and legs to ache. After work that evening, he wanted to find the platoon leader to request a change to a lighter type of labor. Just at this time, the platoon organized the study of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Hard work is like a burden placed in front of us, seeing if we dare to bear it. Burdens are light and heavy. Some people pick the light ones and push the heavy ones to others, choosing the light ones to carry. This is not a good attitude." When he heard this, Wang Yongtian struggled in his thoughts. After thinking it over, he gave up the idea of changing jobs and decided to listen to Chairman Mao's words, becoming a good comrade who dares to bear heavy burdens. He wrote in his diary: "In the face of hardships, only by first overcoming the fear in one's mind can one overcome the difficulties in work. If there is no fear in one's mind, there will be no difficulties in work." In this way, he studied and tempered himself, finally enduring the hardships and difficulties. Later, he summarized his experience of studying and practicing, saying: "The shoulder has a piece of flesh worn away, and the mind has a thought of fearing hardships removed; the shoulder has a callus, and the mind has a spirit of daring to struggle tempered." Many soldiers, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, after this hard construction practice, changed their attitude towards difficulties.

Another example is Company Commander Li Shijie learning dialectical materialism in the process of executing tasks. When he first became a company commander, he did not dare to train the troops in harsh and complex conditions. One day last year, according to the plan, there was to be a night shooting practice that evening. In the morning, he heard the weather broadcast that there would be rain and a six-level wind that night. Should they shoot or not? He could not decide, fearing that the bad weather would make the soldiers unable to feel the effect and waste the bullets. The company cadres discussed this problem while studying Chairman Mao's words on where correct thoughts come from. After studying and discussing, it was clear that only by insisting on training in complex conditions could one understand the law of hitting the target in various situations, and wind and rain were good opportunities to master new skills, and one should insist on shooting. The result was a hit rate of 67%. When it came to the formal night shooting, it went very smoothly. Through this incident, Li Shijie felt deeply, saying: This shooting practice gave me a living education in dialectical materialism. When training, avoiding the easy and choosing the difficult, shooting becomes difficult; when training, avoiding the difficult and choosing the easy, shooting becomes easy. Only by daring to struggle and practice can one understand the law and gain freedom.

From practice, we deeply realized that every time we execute a difficult task, some soldiers are prone to ideological fluctuations. At this time, it is most necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought to solve problems. However, work is often very busy, and it is not possible to have a large block of time to sit down and study. What should we do? Chairman Mao said: "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious.' The Communist Party is the most serious about this." He also said: "Only by grasping something tightly and not relaxing can it be grasped. If it is grasped but not tightly, it is as good as not grasping it." In our company, we advocate the "iron wedge" spirit in studying Chairman Mao's works during work. In the midst of busy tasks, it is not enough to just squeeze in; even if there is no "gap," we use an iron wedge to squeeze in.

The soldiers said well: "Fish cannot live without water, babies cannot live without mothers, and revolutionary soldiers cannot live without Chairman Mao's works." We must squeeze out the territory for Mao Zedong Thought and make the atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works thick. In this way, we can make cadres and soldiers receive more education from Mao Zedong Thought in work practice and better transform their worldviews.

Handing Over the Leadership of the Company to Those Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor."

Several years of practice have made us realize that to make the company a good school of Mao Zedong Thought, we must also have a cadre team loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we ensure that this school firmly holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strongly resist the influence of military absolutism, withstand any impact from any direction, and firmly defend the proletarian ideological position.

In our efforts to build cadres, we mainly follow the standards of Mao Zedong Thought, boldly promote cadres, and insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and improve them, striving to build a cadre team loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. The specific methods are as follows:

First, organize cadres to learn Chairman Mao's military thoughts in the struggle between the two military lines.

In our army, the struggle between the proletarian military line and the bourgeois military line has never stopped. This struggle must be reflected in the minds of our cadres. Chairman Mao said: "History tells us that the correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, regard various erroneous thoughts as "fertilizer," organize cadres to struggle against various bourgeois military thoughts, make cadres learn from this, and continuously improve their understanding of Chairman Mao's military thoughts.

Some people think that if military technology is not good, it means that Chairman Mao's works have not been studied well; if military technology is good, it means that Chairman Mao's works have been studied well. Some even compare politics and technology to two legs, saying that the Red Ninth Company is "only red, not professional," is "one leg," "one and a half legs," and so on. Our party branch decided to use the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the resolution of the 1960 enlarged meeting of the Military Commission as weapons, mobilize the masses, and carry out a big debate around this main issue. In the debate, everyone spoke many specific facts and profound truths, criticizing this erroneous thought. The so-called good technology is good study of Chairman Mao's works, which is a lie, actually opposing the emphasis on politics and opposing the study of Chairman Mao's works. The fundamental purpose of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is to achieve the ideological revolutionization of people, which is a major direction, ensuring that every soldier of ours is always revolutionary, ensuring that our country will never change color. If we only grasp technology, it will be like Soviet revisionism, with satellites in the sky but thoughts on the ground. If we regard military affairs as one leg and the study of Chairman Mao's works as one leg, this is extremely wrong. If there is no head armed with Mao Zedong Thought, no soul, not to mention one leg, two legs, even if there are thousands of legs and ten thousand legs, they will not walk to communism but will retreat to capitalism. Through debate and summary, everyone improved their understanding and strengthened their awareness of actively studying Chairman Mao's works.

The most intense moment of struggling against erroneous military thoughts is also the moment when we most deeply understand Chairman Mao's military thoughts. Through struggle, we withstood the impact of erroneous military thoughts, educated ourselves, turned a bad thing into a good thing, and tempered cadres and soldiers in the struggle between the two military lines.

Second, help cadres break through one point, taste the sweetness, and improve their awareness in studying Chairman Mao's works.

People always change the objective world according to their worldview. If a cadre's mind has Mao Zedong Thought, he will build the company according to Mao Zedong Thought in work practice; if a cadre's mind does not have Mao Zedong Thought, he will use erroneous thoughts to change the company in work practice. Therefore, to make cadres consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate soldiers, we must continuously increase Mao Zedong Thought in their minds and help them first break through one point in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, taste the sweetness, and gradually form the habit of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Helping each cadre to break through one point and taste the sweetness, the most important thing is to choose the "point" well. Each person's situation is different, and the "point" is also different. It must be concretely analyzed and treated differently. This "point" can be ideological or work-related, but it must be the most urgent problem that needs to be solved and is difficult to solve. Only by breaking through at such a "point" can there be sweetness. If the "point" is not chosen correctly, it will not be easy to break through, and even if it is broken through, it will not taste much sweetness. Breaking through one point, having a good start, can continuously improve the awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works.

Third, develop party members, select platoon leaders, and promote cadres from among the active study-and-apply-Chairman-Mao's-works activists, and establish the roots firmly.

To build the company into a good school of Mao Zedong Thought, the leadership must be in the hands of those loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. In addition to relying on education and improvement, we must also have a set of specific organizational construction methods to ensure this, starting from nurturing and selecting seedlings, and establishing the roots firmly. The question of selecting what seedlings is actually the question of handing over the leadership to whom.

In recent years, we have insisted on developing party members from among the active study-and-apply-Chairman-Mao's-works activists, selecting platoon leaders from among the active study-and-apply-Chairman-Mao's-works activists, and promoting cadres from among the active study-and-apply-Chairman-Mao's-works activists, firmly grasping the three key points of developing party members, selecting platoon leaders, and promoting cadres. Experience shows that by doing so, we can best insist on the policy of selecting cadres with both virtue and ability. What is virtue? It is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective world well. What is ability? It is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the objective world well. The so-called virtue and ability are to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform both the subjective world and the objective world well. On the contrary, those without Mao Zedong Thought are lacking in great virtue and great ability and must not be promoted. For cadres, party members, and active study-and-apply-Chairman-Mao's-works activists, we must have high standards and strict requirements. Even if there is a drop of bourgeois ideology, it must not be ignored and must be evaporated by the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent years, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought, we have cultivated batch after batch of successors loyal to Mao Zedong Thought; handing over the leadership work to these people loyal to Mao Zedong Thought has ensured the correct political direction of the company in establishing Mao Zedong Thought.

Every soldier we cultivate should make Chairman Mao feel at ease.

We have organized cadres and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works for nearly seven years. Our understanding of using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and cultivate people has gradually improved.

Before 1959, for a period of time, we began to organize the study of Chairman Mao's works mainly to better complete the work tasks at that time. Later, we saw that after the soldiers studied Chairman Mao's works, their thoughts progressed rapidly, and the atmosphere of the company gradually changed. We felt that if we continued to grasp it like this, the soldiers would not have major problems during their service, would not cause trouble, and would not bring disgrace to the company, which would be fine.

Just at this time, we heard the news that a demobilized soldier from our company had made a mistake. After hearing this news, I thought about many problems over and over again and felt more and more ashamed. Chairman Mao said: "Our responsibility is to the people." Chairman Mao called on every Communist Party member to learn from Comrade Bai Qiuen, to be extremely responsible to work, and to be extremely enthusiastic to comrades and the people. The purpose of our ideological work, the responsibility of the cadres of our company, is it just to manage the soldiers' few years in the company without problems? Is this an extremely responsible attitude towards work? Is this an extremely enthusiastic attitude towards comrades and the people? I felt that as a Communist Party member, I am not only responsible for the construction of a company but also for the entire cause of the party. I am not only responsible for the progress of soldiers in the company but also for the soldiers' lifelong revolution. Only by starting from the entire cause of the party and thinking about letting soldiers revolutionize for a lifetime can we truly manage the soldiers' few years in the company; only by truly managing the soldiers' few years in the company can we lay a good ideological foundation for the soldiers' lifelong revolution.

Chairman Mao stands the highest and sees the farthest. For the future of the proletarian revolutionary cause and for the country's eternal prosperity, he has put forward the cultivation of revolutionary successors as a top priority. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, grasp the work of cultivating revolutionary successors, pass on the class of Mao Zedong Thought, and pass it down. Cultivating successors requires a solid foundation, which is to uproot the non-proletarian ideological roots in soldiers' minds and deeply plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought. Only with deep roots can one not be shaken by the wind. In this way, no matter where they go and no matter what obstacles and difficulties they encounter, they will definitely firmly pass on Mao Zedong Thought and become a shining red seed, making one place red and one place red, making one place bright and one place bright, letting Mao Zedong Thought shine brightly over the five lakes and four seas.

Every year, our company has a batch of old soldiers demobilized. They have worked in the army for four or five years and have a good foundation for studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming thoughts. If they can actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought after returning to their hometowns and play the role of red seeds, they will make greater contributions to the party's cause. Before the old soldiers leave, we organize them to study a passage from Chairman Mao's "On the Talks at Chongqing": "We Communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we go to a place, we must combine with the local people, take root, bloom, and bear fruit in the people." We also study Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on taking the propagation and implementation of Mao Zedong Thought as a lifelong career. The party branch requires demobilized old soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime and propagate Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime.

Some demobilized soldiers have created many touching examples in propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Our workers and peasants are the most loving of Chairman Mao and the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words. Although they have left the company, as long as Mao Zedong Thought has armed their minds, no matter where they go, they are completely reliable and can be trusted.

Our company has achieved some achievements and progress under the correct leadership of the party, with the whole company implementing and executing Mao Zedong Thought. However, due to our subjective efforts being insufficient, there are still many weak links in our work. Compared with Chairman Mao's instructions that the army should become a revolutionary great school, there is still a big gap. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee issued a call to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We express our most resolute support and most enthusiastic response. In the future, we must study Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, implement Mao Zedong Thought more faithfully, propagate Mao Zedong Thought more enthusiastically, and defend Mao Zedong Thought more bravely, and continue to strive to build the company into a good school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    把连队建设成毛泽东思想的好学校
    解放军某部团政治处副主任、前红九连指导员　陈金元
    一九四九年二月，毛主席在《把军队变为工作队》一文中说过：“军队就是一个学校，二百一十万野战军，等于几千个大学和中学，一切工作干部，主要地依靠军队本身来解决。”最近，毛主席又指出：人民解放军应该是一个大学校。我们体会，把军队办成大学校，最根本的就是用毛泽东思想教育人、武装人，造就具有共产主义觉悟的革命战士。
    我们连是毛主席在井冈山亲手创建的一个红军连队。它从诞生的那一天起，就是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的一座革命熔炉。我们的老前辈，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在长期的革命斗争实践中，造就了许多优秀的革命干部和英雄的革命战士，为人民立下了不朽的功勋。
    一九六一年七月，林彪同志来我部视察工作时指出：好的连队就是一个学校，九连就是一个好学校。林彪同志的指示，极大地鼓舞了我们，给我们增添了无比的信心和力量。几年来，我们按照林彪同志的指示，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，加强政治思想工作，狠抓世界观的改造，使连队的光荣传统进一步得到了发扬光大，加强了革命熔炉的作用。一批又一批来自农村、工厂、学校的普通青年，在毛泽东思想哺育下，迅速成长为自觉的革命战士。一九六一年以来，先后出现了活学活用毛主席著作的标兵和积极分子一百七十五人，一百一十名战士加入了中国共产党，二十一人被提升为干部。由于毛泽东思想在许多战士头脑里扎下了根子，他们复员后，也能作到坚持学习和传播毛泽东思想，许多人能起到“红色种子”的作用。连队建设一年比一年加强，连续五年被评为四好连队。一九六四年，国防部授予我们以“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”的称号。
    用毛泽东思想培养人是一切工作的根本
    一九五九年以前，我们连队的干部，也想把工作搞好。但是，方向不明确，一天到晚光是在军事训练、队列生活、清洁卫生这些事情上兜圈子，抓事务性的工作多，抓政治思想工作少，抓物不抓人，连队中问题很多。有人说，当时的情况是“内务整齐，人心不齐”。我们几个干部心里着急得很。
    一九五九年，林彪同志发表了《高举党的总路线和毛泽东军事思想的红旗阔步前进》的文章。林彪同志说：“装备、技术固然重要，但是人的因素更为重要。技术也是要人去掌握的。人和物应当统一起来，并且要以人为主导因素。”又说：“在新的历史时期，军队的政治工作、思想工作十分重要，是万万放松不得的。……政治是最根本的东西，政治工作、思想工作不做好，其他一切工作就都无从谈起。”林彪同志这些话，把连队的问题点得清清楚楚。在支委会上，我向大家介绍了林彪同志的文章，并和大家一起学习了毛主席起草的古田会议决议中“关于单纯军事观点”一节。经过充分讨论，决定认真组织连队学习毛主席著作，抓好人的思想教育工作。
    不久，我们九连要同五连举行拔河比赛。五连是一九五五年参加北京全军运动会的拔河冠军队。许多人一听说同五连比赛，就泄了气，说：“想战胜五连的大个子，根本没门。”我们针对这种信心不足的情况，组织学习了毛主席有关主观能动性的论述。拔河队同志一边学习，一边练习，越学习越起劲。比赛结果，九连获胜。五连同志哪里服气，于是双方约定春节再赛。五连劲头很足，夜晚也进行练习，他们把绳子一端缠在大树上，对大树使劲。我们拔河队的同志看到后，就用毛主席关于主观能动性的论述分析说：“树是死家伙，这样练，人的能力得不到很好的锻炼，究竟拔河能力提高了多少也没有底。我们不能拔死树，要拔活人。”根据大家的意见，我们挑选了三十名战士同二十五名拔河队员进行练习，在练习中战士人数逐步增加，后来，二十五人可以有把握地拔过三十三人了。春节比赛，我们拔河队又以三比○取胜。我们的劲是从哪里来的？拔河队的同志说：这都是听了毛主席的教导，发挥了主观能动性的结果。干部们也看到了用毛泽东思想把人的思想统一起来的巨大威力，看到了只要把人的积极性充分调动起来，就能创造出想也想不到的奇迹。
    过了一段时间，我们去修水库，发现有些老战士情绪不高。一了解，主要是不能正确对待入党入团问题。如七班长说：“进步不进步，主要看领导，领导培养谁，谁就进步快。”部分老兵由于存在这种思想问题，不仅在劳动中起不到带头作用，还影响了新兵的情绪。
    经过研究，决定学习毛主席关于内因与外因关系问题的指示，解决片面强调客观原因、不重视主观努力的问题。毛主席说：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”讨论中，七班长说：“我看哪，一个人进步的根本原因就是靠外因。连队好比熔炉，战士好比矿石，领导好比工人。矿石再好，领导上不给你烧火，再使劲也变不成钢。”有几个人赞成他的意见，但许多同志不同意这种看法。八班战士李志华说：“光强调外因是片面的。一个人的进步，外因虽然是重要的，但更重要的是内因。我们不要忘了人是活矿石，如果自己不主动接触烈火，老是怕烧怕烫，我看一辈子也变不成钢。”经过一场热烈辩论，一致认为：外因是进步的条件，内因是进步的根本，外因要通过内因起作用。七班长的脑子大大开了窍，从此，学习劳动都很好，两次获得了先进生产者奖状。他深有所感地说：“强调外因吃苦头，强调内因有甜头。”后来，他加入了中国共产党。
    这次学习毛主席著作，把老兵的思想问题解决了，新兵也受到一次教育，有力地推动了施工任务的完成。我们进一步认识到，抓人的工作要抓人的思想改造，只有思想问题解决了，人们的主动性、积极性才能充分发挥出来。
    一九六○年，林彪同志亲自主持军委扩大会议，制订了《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》。决议强调坚持四个第一，号召高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅。决议指出：“只有通过坚强的政治思想工作，提高广大官兵的政治觉悟，鼓舞人们的勇敢精神和顽强意志，发挥人的高度积极性和主动性，才能使我们永远立于不败之地。”这些话我们感到特别亲切。大家越学心里越明亮，越学方向越清楚，更加坚定了用毛泽东思想教育人、培养人的信心。我们决心坚定不移地按照军委决议所指引的方向继续前进，让毛泽东思想在九连扎根，成为代代相传的法宝。
    用毛泽东思想教育人、培养人，最根本的是抓什么呢？我们在实践中体会到，最根本的是抓阶级和阶级斗争的教育。
    一九六一年和一九六二年，连队补入了两批城市知识青年战士。他们热情很高，上进心强，学习新东西快，给部队增添了新的力量。但也带来了一些新的问题。如有的追求个人名利，认为当步兵是大材小用，有的不服从领导，组织纪律性很差，还有的追求生活享受。
    这些青年战士大多是工农子弟，思想比较纯洁，但是他们没有经受过旧社会劳动人民的苦难生活，尽管生活在幸福之中，也不知足，这山望着那山高，不知阶级的大事和革命的需要。正像林彪同志所说的：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”如果不给青年战士补上阶级斗争这一课，他们就不可能真正学好毛泽东思想，想问题就没有根据，没有基础。于是，我们大抓阶级教育，学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》等文章，组织访贫问苦，调查战士家史，启发战士忆苦思甜，提高他们的阶级觉悟。经过教育，大大激发了他们的革命精神和学习毛主席著作的积极性。许多战士沉痛地检查了自己的错误思想，表示要牢记阶级苦，老老实实当好普通一兵，全心全意为人民服务。
    以后，战士中还是不断出现思想问题，有些问题老是解决不了。正在这时，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召。我们认真学习了毛主席的这一指示，并结合重温了军委扩大会议决议。我们认识到，社会上的阶级斗争必然要反映到部队内部来，资产阶级思想对战士的影响还很广泛。为了加强现实的阶级教育，我们发动大家摆敌情，请驻地附近公社的干部介绍农村的阶级斗争情况，使战士看到了阶级敌人的凶恶面目，提高了阶级警惕性。我们还经常搞“调查敌情”，抓住活靶子，让大家运用毛泽东思想进行分析批判，解决自己的问题，改造世界观。
    用毛主席关于阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的思想武装战士的头脑，使他们具有牢固的阶级斗争观念，鲜明的敌我界限，这是革命的基础课。这一课非得抓好不可，抓不住就要犯极大的错误。只有懂得阶级斗争，才能认清自己的思想问题是从哪里来的，会向何处发展，才能自觉地学习毛主席著作，消除旧思想的影响，增强免疫力。
    用小整风的方法学习毛主席著作，启发战士自觉革命
    对战士头脑中的问题，也就是他们受到的各种旧思想的侵蚀，我们除了引导他们在参加社会阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，逐步清除旧思想的影响外，同时，还按照毛主席关于整风的指示，把整风精神贯彻到经常性的学习毛主席著作中，启发战士自觉革命，克服各种非无产阶级思想，逐步树立无产阶级世界观。
    我们看到，战士一方面受着社会主义思想教育，一方面又有资产阶级思想影响，所以他们头脑里有“解放区”，也有“敌占区”，有“红区”，也有“白区”。毛主席说：“一切过程中矛盾着的各方面，本来是互相排斥、互相斗争、互相对立的。”新旧两种思想“住宿”在一起，你不吃掉它，它就会吃掉你，绝不会和平共处。我们做思想工作，就要采取进攻姿态，积极同各种错误思想进行斗争，把战士头脑里旧思想占领的阵地解放出来，把共产主义新思想灌输进去。
    毛主席说：“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性。”改造战士的思想，也是内因起决定作用，必须依靠战士自觉革命。领导上的责任是创造外因条件，调动战士头脑里的积极因素去克服消极因素，促使他们自觉进行思想斗争，用战士的说法，叫自己进行新旧思想“打架”。
    用小整风的方法学习毛主席著作，是引导战士进行自觉革命的一个好方法。这种方法，是在贯彻林彪同志提出的带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫的原则的过程中，逐步摸索出来的。毛主席说：“整风就是全党通过批评和自我批评来学习马克思主义。在整风中间，我们一定可以更多地学到一些马克思主义。”小整风是把整风的精神经常化，作为学习毛主席著作改造思想的一种经常形式。它的基本精神是调动积极因素，启发自觉革命，拔掉资产阶级思想的根子，扎进毛泽东思想的根子。
    在小整风中，怎样调动积极因素，启发群众自觉革命？
    一、把毛泽东思想灌输到战士头脑里去
    要使战士头脑里的正确思想战胜错误思想，最根本的是引导他们学习毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想灌输到他们头脑里去，加强他们内在的积极因素。战士头脑里有了毛泽东思想，就有了分清是非的标准，有了战斗的武器，形形色色的非无产阶级思想就会被一口一口吃掉。
    我们在小整风中灌输毛泽东思想，是一次学习一个基本观点，反复地学，学深学透。整篇的文章也学，但是围绕着基本观点来学。学篇是为了学点，是从文章中找出解决问题的立场、观点、方法；学点可以带篇，掌握了基本观点，才能更好地领会整篇文章的精神实质。真正学透一个观点，可以举一反三，解决一连串的问题。战士们说：学透一个观点，可以管一辈子，用一辈子。日积月累，学过的一些基本观点就可以融会贯通，穿起串来，逐步把毛泽东思想真正学到手。几年来，我们用小整风的方法组织大家反复学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争、人民战争、突出政治、为人民服务、艰苦奋斗、一分为二、两个飞跃等基本观点，大破了资产阶级思想，大立了毛泽东思想。
    二、抓好“纲”上的活思想
    战士头脑里两种思想的斗争，就像两军对战。在这场“战斗”中，一方面要用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑，把他们原有的朴素阶级觉悟提高到自觉的程度，给无产阶级思想造成优势；另一方面要使他们认清自己的错误思想，找准“敌人”，这样才能做到知己知彼，打一仗，胜一仗。
    帮助战士找准问题，不能就事论事地抓一些具体问题，要透过他们的思想抓到根子上。每个战士的思想问题都不是偶然产生的，是有着深刻的阶级根源的。这是社会阶级斗争在战士头脑里的反映，我们把它叫作“纲”上的活思想。抓好了“纲”上的活思想，问题就解决得深，就能从根本上加强世界观的改造；如果抓不好，问题就解决得浅，就像“铲草不除根，春来又返青”。当然，战士世界观的改造不可能是抓一次就完成的，但是抓好“纲”上的活思想，抓一次，就可以在思想革命化上有一个飞跃；反复地抓下去，战士头脑里的无产阶级思想阵地就可以一步一步地扩大，资产阶级思想的地盘就会被一步一步地挤掉。
    三、引导战士总结改造思想的经验
    运用总结经验的方法学习毛主席著作，是我们在小整风中启发战士进行自觉革命的基本形式。这种方法，最能调动战士改造思想的主动性，最能引起战士自己进行新旧思想斗争。要总结好，就要学好用好，就要学用结合，联系思想进行对照比较，分析提高，找经验，找教训。这样，就一定会引起头脑里的两种思想“打架”。四班有个战士，开始学习毛主席著作时，自觉革命精神比较差，说是说，做是做。如学习一分为二观点后，我对他说：你用一分为二观点把自己的思想好好总结总结。他听了很高兴，回去把所有的优点都写在纸上，可一琢磨，觉得不对头。他想，指导员叫我总结学一分为二观点的体会，我光找优点，不成一分法了吗？于是进行了思想“打架”，用一分为二观点把自己的优缺点作了全面分析。他又进一步用一分为二观点找全班同志的优点，并对照自己找了八条差距，在行动中一条一条克服，思想进步很快。他在总结体会时说：“学习一分为二，要学会分，更要学会斗。会分，才能看清自己头脑里的先进思想和落后思想；会斗，才能用毛泽东思想克服自己的落后思想。”
    引导战士总结改造思想的经验，不仅能提高自觉革命精神，而且可以克服学习一般化的毛病，使认识不断深化，使毛泽东思想的根子在自己的头脑里越扎越深。同志们反映：总结经验给我们插了路标，知道下一步怎么走了。
    四、运用典型引路
    典型引路是推动战士自觉革命的一种活方法、好方法。如一九六三年，搞“挖非无产阶级思想烙印”的小整风，有些同志不敢大胆亮思想，怕丑怕痛。我们就先让亮思想好的一位同志给大家介绍了自己所沾染的非无产阶级思想。他说：“我高中毕业后，一心想投考音乐学院，将来当个音乐家。入伍后总放不下这个包袱，感到当兵吃了亏，心想，当音乐家的理想全完了。这个思想是从哪里来的呢？主要是受了家中旧思想的影响。妈妈临死的头一天还对我说，你的嗓子很好，又爱好音乐，好好钻一钻，争取将来当个音乐家。妈妈死去三年了，可是她说的这些话还深深留在我的脑子里。现在才认识到，这是给我灌输了非无产阶级思想，不是叫我当个有文化的普通工人、农民、战士，而是叫我成名成家。我要坚决挖掉这种资产阶级个人主义思想烙印。”他的介绍，启发了很多同志。接着，在全连展开了自觉挖非无产阶级思想烙印的活动。
    我们体会到，用典型引路的方法，能够在人们头脑外面设置起活的对立面，使大家看到高低，找到差距，明确方向，引起头脑里的对立面的斗争。只要拿出典型一讲，就可以打破平静，打开思路，使好多人坐不住，都去思考问题，进行思想“打架”。
    在执行各项工作任务中，用毛泽东思想改造人的世界观
    在完成各项工作任务的过程中，能不能改造人的世界观呢？这个问题我们是经过了一段实践才搞清楚的。开始，一搞训练，就只想到打靶；一搞施工，就只想到石头；一搞生产，就只想到粮食。好像执行工作任务就只能搞这些东西。后来，学习了毛主席的语录：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”我们认识到执行各种工作任务的过程，是学习毛泽东思想，改造人的世界观的一个好机会。我们从分析一些同志的情况中看出，在工作实践中，人的世界观并不是自然地就可以得到改造的。凡是有所进步的同志，都是在工作实践中注意学习运用毛主席著作的结果。这就是说，无产阶级世界观，必须在毛泽东思想指引下，自觉实践，自觉改造，才能逐渐树立起来。如果在完成工作任务中，忽视学习毛主席著作，失掉了指导人们实践的思想武器，那样，人的思想也就不可能得到改造。
    在执行工作任务过程中，我们抓战士世界观的改造，就是要战士努力学习毛主席著作，解决现实思想问题，指导行动，在工作实践中磨炼思想；在实践的基础上，又用毛泽东思想为指导去进行总结，进一步丰富思想。这也就是我们常说的思想上的“飞跃”。
    有一次，我们连搞施工，主要任务是淘沙子。新战士王永田是个从城市来的学生兵，在家没参加过劳动。头一天分配他担沙子，肩上就磨起了鸡蛋黄大的一个泡，压得腰酸腿疼。晚上收工后，他想找班长提出换一个劳动轻一点的工种。这时，正好班里组织学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”学到这里，王永田思想斗争很激烈。想来想去，打消了调换工种的念头，决心听毛主席的话，做一个敢于挑重担子的好同志。他在日记中写道：“在艰苦困难面前，只有首先斗倒了脑子里的怕字，才能在工作上斗倒难字。头脑里没有怕字，工作上才没有难字。”就这样，边学习边锻炼，终于经住了艰苦困难的考验。后来，他总结这段学习和实践的体会说：“肩膀上磨破了一块肉，脑瓜里磨掉了一个畏难怕苦的思想；肩膀上磨起一块肉茧，脑瓜里磨炼出敢于斗争的精神”。许多战士在毛泽东思想指导下，经过这次艰苦施工的锻炼，改变了对待困难的态度。
    再讲一个连长李世杰在工作任务中学习唯物辩证法的事例。他刚当连长的时候，不敢在艰苦复杂的条件下放手训练部队。去年有一天，按计划当天晚上要进行一次体会射击。上午，听到气象广播，晚上有中雨，六级风。究竟打不打呢？他拿不定主意，怕这样坏的天气进行射击，战士体会不到东西，把子弹浪费了。连的干部结合这个问题学习毛主席关于人的正确思想是从那里来的。经过学习讨论，明确了只有坚持在复杂条件下进行训练，才能认识各种情况下打得准的规律，刮风下雨正是掌握新本领的好机会，应当坚持打。结果命中率达到百分之六十七。到正式进行夜间射击时，打得很顺利。通过这件事，李世杰感受很深，他说：这次打靶使自己受到了一次唯物辩证法的活教育，训练时候避易就难，打靶时候就变难为易；训练时候避难就易，打靶时候就变易为难。只有敢于斗争，敢于实践，才能认识规律，获得自由。
    从实践中，我们深深体会到，每当执行艰苦的工作任务时，有些战士容易引起思想波动。这个时候，最需要用毛泽东思想来解决问题。但是，工作往往是很紧张的，不可能有大块的时间坐下来学习。怎么办呢？毛主席说：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”又说：“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”我们连队在工作中学习毛主席著作，提倡“铁楔子精神”。在繁忙的工作任务中，光是见缝插针还不行，就是没有“缝”，用铁楔子挤也要挤进去。
    战士们说得好：“鱼儿离开水不行，婴儿离开娘不行，革命战士离开毛主席著作不行”。我们就是要为毛泽东思想狠挤阵地，把学习毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的。这样，才能使干部战士在工作实践中更多地受到毛泽东思想的教育，更好地改造世界观。
    把连队的领导权交给忠实于毛泽东思想的人
    毛主席教导我们说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”
    几年的实践使我们体会到，要把连队办成一个毛泽东思想的好学校，还必须有一个忠实于毛泽东思想的干部班子。这样，才能保证这个学校坚定不移地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，有力地抵制单纯军事观点的影响，顶住来自任何方面的冲击，坚守住无产阶级思想阵地。
    我们抓干部建设，主要是按照毛泽东思想的标准，大胆提拔，并且坚持用毛泽东思想教育提高，努力建设一个忠实于毛泽东思想的干部班子。具体作法有三点：
    一、组织干部在两条建军路线的斗争中，学习毛主席的建军思想
    在我们军队里，无产阶级军事路线同资产阶级军事路线的斗争，从来就没有停止过。这种斗争，必然反映到我们干部头脑中来。毛主席说：“历史告诉我们，正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”我们按照毛主席的教导，把各种错误思想看作是“肥田粉”，组织干部同形形色色的资产阶级军事思想作斗争，使干部从中受到教育，不断提高对毛主席建军思想的认识。
    有人认为，军事技术不好，就是毛主席著作没学好；军事技术好了，才能说是毛主席著作学好了。有人甚至把政治和技术比作两条腿，说红九连是“只红不专”，是“一条腿”，“一条半腿”，等等。我们党支部确定，以古田会议决议和一九六○年军委扩大会议决议为武器，放手发动群众，围绕着这个主要问题，开展一场大辩论。辩论中，大家讲了许多具体的事实和深刻的道理，批判了这种错误思想。所谓技术好，就是学习毛主席著作好，这是骗人的鬼话，实际上是反对突出政治，反对学习毛主席著作。活学活用毛主席著作的根本目的是为了实现人的思想革命化，这是个大方向，是保证我们每个战士永远革命，保证我们国家永不变质的问题。光抓技术就会像苏联修正主义一样，卫星上了天，思想却下了地。把军事当成一条腿，把学习毛主席著作当成一条腿，这是极端错误的。如果没有用毛泽东思想武装起来的头脑，没有了灵魂，不用说有一条腿、两条腿，就是有千条腿、万条腿，也不会走到共产主义，而是退到资本主义去。通过辩论、总结，大家提高了认识，加强了学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    同错误的军事思想斗争最激烈的时刻，也是我们领会毛主席建军思想最深刻的时刻。通过斗争，我们顶住了错误的军事思想的冲击，教育了自己，把坏事变成了好事，使干部、战士在两条建军路线的斗争中受到了锻炼。
    二、帮助干部在学习毛主席著作中突破一点，尝到甜头，提高自觉性
    人们总是按照自己的世界观去改造客观世界的。干部头脑里有毛泽东思想，他在工作实践中就会按照毛泽东思想去建设连队；干部头脑里没有毛泽东思想，他在工作实践中就会用错误的思想去改造连队。因此，要想干部能够自觉地用毛泽东思想去培养战士，就必须使他们头脑中不断地增加毛泽东思想，必须帮助他们在活学活用毛主席著作中首先突破一点，尝到甜头，逐步养成活学活用毛主席著作的习惯。
    帮助每个干部突破一点，尝到甜头，最要紧的是选好“点”。每个人的情况不同，“点”也不同，要具体分析，区别对待。这个“点”，可以是思想上的，也可以是工作上的，但都必须是最需要解决而又不好解决的问题。在这样的“点”上突破后，才会有甜头。“点”找不准，就不容易突破，突破了，也尝不到多大甜头。突破了一点，有了好的开端，就能不断提高学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    三、从学习毛主席著作积极分子中，发展党员，选拔班长，提拔干部，把根子扎正
    要把连队建设成毛泽东思想的好学校，领导权一定要由忠实于毛泽东思想的人来掌握。这除了靠教育提高以外，还要在组织建设上有一套具体办法来保证，从育苗、选苗做起，把根子扎正。选什么苗子的问题，实际上是把领导权交给什么人的问题。
    几年来，我们坚持从学习毛主席著作积极分子中发展党员，从学习毛主席著作积极分子中选拔班长，从学习毛主席著作积极分子中提拔干部，把好发展党员、选拔班长、提拔干部这三个关口。经验说明，这样做就能最好地坚持德才兼备的干部政策。什么是德？就是用毛泽东思想改造主观世界好。什么是才？就是用毛泽东思想改造客观世界好。所谓德才兼备，就是用毛泽东思想改造主观世界和改造客观世界都好。相反，没有毛泽东思想的人，就是缺大德、少大才，是千万提拔不得的。对干部，对党员，对学习毛主席著作积极分子，必须高标准、严要求，那怕是有一点资产阶级思想的水珠，也不可忽视，一定要用毛泽东思想的阳光把它蒸发掉。
    几年来，我们通过大立毛泽东思想，培养出一茬一茬的忠实于毛泽东思想的接班人；把领导工作交给这些忠实于毛泽东思想的人，保证了连队大立毛泽东思想的正确政治方向。
    我们培养出来的每个战士，都应当让毛主席放心
    我们组织干部战士学习毛主席著作，将近七年了。我们对于用毛泽东思想教育人、培养人的认识，是逐步提高起来的。
    一九五九年以前的一个时期，开始组织学习毛主席著作，主要是为着更好地完成当时的工作任务。后来，看到战士们学了毛主席著作后，思想进步很快，连队的空气逐渐发生了变化，就觉得照这样抓下去，战士在服役期间不出什么大问题，不捅漏子，不给连队抹灰，就行了。
    就在这个时候，传来了我们连队一个复员战士犯错误的消息。听到这个消息后，我反来复去想了许多问题，越想越感到惭愧。毛主席说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”毛主席号召每个共产党员都要学习白求恩同志，对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。我们做思想工作的目的，我们连队干部的责任，难道就是管战士在连队的几年不出问题吗？这是对工作极端负责的态度吗？这是对同志对人民极端热忱的态度吗？我觉得，作为一个共产党员，不仅对一个连队的建设有责任，而且对党的整个事业也有责任，不仅对战士在连队的进步有责任，而且对战士一辈子革命也有责任。只有从党的整个事业出发，想到让战士革命一辈子，才能确实管好战士在连队的几年；真正管好战士在连队的几年，才能为战士革命一辈子打好思想基础。
    毛主席站得最高，看得最远，为着无产阶级革命事业的前途，为着祖国千秋万代永不变色，他把培养革命接班人当作一件头等大事提了出来。我们决心照毛主席的指示去做，抓好培养革命接班人的工作，把毛泽东思想的班接过来，传下去。培养接班人要把根基打牢，就是要把战士头脑里的非无产阶级思想根子拔掉，把毛泽东思想的根子扎得深深的。根深才不怕风摇动。这样，他们无论走到哪里，遇到什么样的阻挠和困难，也一定会坚定不移地去传播毛泽东思想，成为一颗闪闪发光的红色种子，在一地红一地，到一处红一片，让毛泽东思想把五湖四海都照得通红通红。
    连队每年都有一批老战士复员，他们在部队干了四、五年，学习毛主席著作改造思想有了较好的基础，如果回乡后，都能积极宣传毛泽东思想，起到红色种子的作用，那就对党的事业贡献更大了。老战士临走前，我们就组织他们学习毛主席《关于重庆谈判》一文中的一段话：“我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”还学习了林彪同志关于要把传播、贯彻毛泽东思想作为自己毕生事业的指示。党支部要求复员老战士学习一辈子毛主席著作，宣传一辈子毛泽东思想。
    有些复员战士，在宣传毛泽东思想方面，创造了许多动人的事例。我们的工农战士，最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。尽管他们离开了连队，但只要毛泽东思想武装了他们的头脑，无论走到什么地方，都是完全可以信赖，可以放心的。
    我们连队所以能够取得一些成绩和进步，是在党的正确领导下，全连同志贯彻执行毛泽东思想的结果。但由于我们主观上努力不够，工作中还有许多薄弱环节，同毛主席关于军队应该成为一个革命化的大学校的指示对照起来，还相差得很远。党的八届十一中全会发出了更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大号召。我们表示最坚决地拥护，最热烈地响应。今后，一定要更努力地学习毛泽东思想，更忠实地贯彻毛泽东思想，更热情地宣传毛泽东思想，更勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，继续努力把连队建设成为毛泽东思想的好学校！
