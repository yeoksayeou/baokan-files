The successful testing of missile and nuclear weapons in our country has greatly inspired the revolutionary masses across the nation. Advanced individuals from various fronts have expressed their determination to, together with the broad masses, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to break new ground, be self-reliant, strive hard, and work hard to create new achievements and reach new heights on all fronts.

Revolutionary masses across the country emphasized while celebrating the victory that the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism, the most effective weapon to defeat all enemies and difficulties, and the key to scaling the heights of science and technology. By internalizing Mao Zedong Thought, one will fear no enemies, overcome any obstacles, and find no path impassable. The "Iron Man" of Daqing, Wang Jinxi, the "Five Good" model workers of the Petroleum Industry Department, Zhang Hongchui, Xue Guobang, Pan Xingguo, Wang Zhaohua, and the broad masses of Daqing Oilfield all expressed that the people of Daqing will definitely learn from the comrades who participated in the missile and nuclear weapon testing, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, accelerate the revolutionization of thought, and with the speed of developing missile and nuclear weapons, reach new heights in the petroleum industry and achieve greater feats. Workers like Cai Zucuan from Shanghai, Huang Rongchang, a deputy chief engineer from Chongqing Steel Company, and Chen Yongkang, a farmer scientist from Jiangsu, all expressed their determination to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, overcome all difficulties, dare to tread paths where none have gone before, and create new achievements for the revolution in their respective posts.

Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely accomplish what previous generations could not. Lu Zhidou, a young technician from the Electronic Instrument Factory in Yingkou, Liaoning Province, along with other workers, broke through the blockade of imperialism and revisionism, overcame numerous difficulties, and successfully developed two new products, filling a gap for the motherland. Upon hearing the news of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon testing, Lu Zhidou was greatly inspired. He said, "What we have done is still far from the Party's requirements. We must learn from the heroes who participated in the missile and nuclear weapon testing, strive our utmost to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and dedicate ourselves to the three great revolutionary movements." Fu Shengchang, a worker engineer from Jinan Heavy Machinery Factory and a representative of the National People's Congress, also expressed his determination to use the "Three Articles" as a weapon, break down the "self" and establish the "public," further promote the revolutionization of thought, develop more new products, scale the heights of science and technology, and support the country's socialist construction and world revolution. Sun Zhuankui, a model worker from Tianjin and a fitter from Tianjin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, said, "It is precisely because we studied Chairman Mao's 'Three Articles' that we broke through the revisionist blockade and completed the task of developing new products for diesel locomotives. Whenever we encounter difficulties, face failures, or achieve successes and are prone to arrogance, we repeatedly study the 'Three Articles.' This is how we developed more than twenty new products." Sun Zhuankui said, "Upon hearing the news of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon testing, our hearts are filled with joy. The fact once again proves that with Mao Zedong Thought, we are invincible. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can scale any heights."

The working class of Shanghai, which has made great contributions to scaling the heights of science and technology, is determined to, like the heroes who participated in this test, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly achieve the revolutionization of thought, and make new contributions to accelerating our country's socialist construction and strengthening national defense. Famous innovator Wang Linhe said, "Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, most capable, and most powerful. Our factory only took one year and four months to develop the electric bridge, while the Americans took much longer. This is because we have Mao Zedong Thought." Young workers who created the world's advanced technology of oil fermentation dewaxing, with practical actions, learned from the comrades who participated in this test, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and in the past two days, increased the separation speed of oil fermentation dewaxing by nearly onefold, and the product recovery rate also increased compared to before.

The famous "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew of Beijing Railway Bureau, after informing the crew members of the joyous news of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon testing, excitedly said, "Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force and be able to scale the highest peaks of world science and technology. Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. We have identified it and held it high. We will forever high hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, driving the revolutionary train forever on the track guided by Chairman Mao, and advance with full steam."

Many advanced individuals on the agricultural front expressed their determination to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and achieve greater feats in agriculture. National agricultural labor model and secretary of the Five Public Commune, Ruyang County, Hebei Province, Geng Changsuo said: The reason for the success of the missile and nuclear weapon testing is that Chairman Mao's wise leadership is the first and foremost. We must resolutely implement the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions for a lifetime. We must break down the self and establish the public, further promote the revolutionization of people's thoughts, and strive to achieve the third five-year plan ahead of schedule. National People's Congress representative and party branch secretary of Xiadinjia Brigade, Dalu Family Commune, Huang County, Shandong Province, Wang Yongxing said with great joy, "This missile and nuclear weapon testing success is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to turn poor mountains into rich mountains. In the future, we must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve greater feats in agriculture, contributing more strength to the Chinese revolution and world revolution." Zhang Fengxiang, party branch secretary of Zhuxia Brigade, Zhuxia Commune, Mengyin County, said: Every piece of good news proves that nothing is greater than the power of Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought, it is not difficult. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and detonate an "atomic bomb" in agriculture.

The joyous cheers celebrating our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon testing echoed through the People's Liberation Army's various units. Broad ranks of officers and soldiers enthusiastically cheered this great achievement as a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. At various units' celebration meetings, reporting meetings, and symposiums, officers and soldiers expressed their determination to turn this great victory into a new driving force, most enthusiastically and resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, create a new situation, and achieve new results.

Representatives attending the Kunming Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works were filled with joy and said, "The success of the missile and nuclear weapon testing relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We must turn this great news into a new driving force for better studying Chairman Mao's works." Representatives decided to specially arrange time for discussion meetings and experience-sharing meetings on this great news, further deepen the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and the great significance of emphasizing politics, and discuss the relationship between spirit and matter, politics and business. Representatives immediately took action, adopting a combination of in-meeting learning and out-of-meeting propaganda, quickly launching a new high tide of propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Some representatives also organized reporting teams to nearby units and organizations to give reports, introduce experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, and promote units to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Some leaders above the battalion level from a unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, who were learning from advanced units studying Chairman Mao's works, such as a certain transport team, cheered the greatest victory of Mao Zedong Thought upon hearing the news. Their enthusiasm for learning advanced experiences and studying Chairman Mao's works grew even stronger. They and the transport team's soldiers stood guard together, discussed how to study and apply the "Three Articles," and expressed their determination to master the transport team's experiences, study and apply the "Three Articles" well, grasp the transformation of worldview, use the thought revolutionization of leaders to drive the revolutionization of the unit, and accelerate the revolutionary construction of our army. On the afternoon of the day the news was heard, the political instructor of the 7th Company of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region once again lectured to the entire company's officers and soldiers on Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on raising the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, compared and checked the gaps in the previous stage of learning, and determined to take the "Three Articles" as a motto, repeatedly study and apply, and truly establish a communist worldview of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

Inspired by the great news, many unit officers and soldiers specially studied how to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, proposed new requirements, adopted new measures, and determined to grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works even tighter and more concretely. Representatives attending the Nanjing Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works checked and revised their study plans. All officers and soldiers of an advanced unit studying Chairman Mao's works on Hainan Island immediately held a symposium upon hearing the news, expressing their determination to humbly learn from the comrades who participated in the missile and nuclear weapon testing. All officers and soldiers of this unit also went to the production brigade near their station, held a study and application meeting of the "Three Articles" with poor and lower-middle peasants, and agreed with the brigade party branch to institutionalize the joint study and application meeting of military and civilians, truly achieving mutual learning, mutual promotion, jointly raising the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

After the news of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon testing was announced, the entire city of Beijing was in jubilation. Revolutionary masses continuously walked to the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao's quotations, and quotation books, reporting the joyous news to the Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao.

    各地先进人物和解放军指战员决心向参加这次试验的英雄们学习
    据新华社三十日讯　我国成功地进行了导弹核武器的试验，极大地鼓舞了全国的广大革命群众。各条战线上的先进人物纷纷表示，一定要同广大群众一起，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，发扬敢想敢干敢闯的革命精神，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，奋发图强，在各条战线上创造出新的成绩，攀登新的高峰。
    各地广大革命群众在欢呼胜利时强调指出，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是战胜一切敌人、一切困难的最有效的武器，是攀登科学技术高峰的法宝。把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，就不怕任何敌人，就能突破任何难关，就没有闯不出的道路。大庆“铁人”王进喜、石油工业部五好标兵张洪池、薛国邦、潘兴国、汪兆华和大庆油田广大职工都表示，大庆人一定要向参加发射导弹核武器试验的同志们学习，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，加速思想革命化，用搞导弹核武器的速度，在石油工业战线上攀登新的高峰，搞出更多的大名堂。上海工人出身的电光源专家蔡祖泉、重庆钢铁公司工人出身的副总工程师黄荣昌、江苏的农民科学家陈永康，都纷纷表示决心，要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，排除万难，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，在各自的岗位上为革命而创造新的成就。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，一定能够完成前人所不能完成的事业。辽宁省营口市电子仪器厂青年工人技术员吕志斗曾同其他工人一起，冲破帝国主义和修正主义的封锁，克服重重困难，先后试制成功两种新产品，为祖国填补了一项空白。吕志斗在听到我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息时，受到了巨大的鼓舞。他说，我们所做的距离党的要求还很远。我们要向参加发射导弹核武器试验的英雄们学习，尽最大努力真正把毛泽东思想学到手，献身于三大革命运动。济南重型机械厂工人工程师、全国人民代表大会代表傅圣昌也表示，一定要以“老三篇”为武器，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，进一步促进思想革命化，试制更多的新产品，攀登科学技术高峰，支援国家的社会主义建设和世界革命。天津市五好职工标兵、天津机车车辆厂钳工孙占奎说，我们正是由于学习了毛主席的“老三篇”，终于突破了修正主义的封锁，完成了试制内燃机车用的新产品的任务。我们遇到困难的时候，遭到失败的时候，取得成功而容易骄傲的时候，都反复地学习“老三篇”，终于把二十多种新产品都搞出来了。孙占奎说，听到我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息，我们心里高兴透了。事实再一次证明，有了毛泽东思想，我们就能天下无敌，掌握了毛泽东思想，再高的水平我们也能攀登。
    在攀登科学技术高峰作出巨大贡献的上海工人阶级，决心像参加这次试验的英雄们那样活学活用毛主席著作，彻底实现思想革命化，为加速我国社会主义建设、增强国防力量，作出新的贡献。著名革新闯将王林鹤说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最聪明，最能干，最有力量。我们厂里只用了一年零四个月就试制成电容电桥，而美国却花了很长的时间，这就是因为我们有毛泽东思想。创造石油发酵脱蜡世界先进技术的一些青年工人，以实际行动向参加这次试验的同志们学习，活学活用毛主席著作，这两天又把石油发酵脱蜡的分离速度提高了将近一倍，产品的回收率又比过去增加。
    著名的北京铁路局“毛泽东号”机车包车组的司机长蔡连兴，把我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的喜讯告诉乘务员后，他们激动地说，毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量，就能够攀登世界科学技术的最高峰。毛泽东思想是胜利的旗帜，我们认定了，举定了。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开着革命的列车永远在毛主席指引的轨道上，加足马力前进。
    许多农业战线上的先进人物，表示要用毛泽东思想来武装头脑，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，在农业上创造更大成绩。全国农业劳动模范、河北省饶阳县五公公社社长耿长锁说：发射导弹核武器试验成功的胜利，原因千条万条，毛主席的英明领导是头一条。我们一定要坚决贯彻执行林彪同志的指示，读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，一辈子照毛主席的指示办事。我们要破私立公，进一步促进人的思想革命化，为提前实现第三个五年计划而奋斗。全国人民代表大会代表、山东黄县大吕家公社下丁家大队党总支书记王永幸怀着无比喜悦的心情说，这次导弹核武器试验成功，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们靠毛泽东思想使穷山沟变成了富山沟。今后我们一定要响应林彪同志的号召，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，在农业上做出更大的成绩，为中国革命和世界革命贡献更多的力量。蒙阴县诸夏公社诸夏大队党支部书记张凤祥说：一桩桩喜事，都证明了天大地大，没有毛泽东思想的威力大；千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难。我们一定要用毛泽东思想武装起来，在农业上放出“原子弹”。
    据新华社三十日讯　热烈庆祝我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的欢呼声，响彻人民解放军各个部队，广大指战员纵情欢呼这一伟大成就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利。在各部队举行的庆祝大会、报喜大会和座谈会上，指战员们纷纷表示，要把这一伟大胜利作为新的推动力量，最热烈最坚决地响应林彪同志的号召，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高举更高举，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，搞出新的局面，取得新的收获。
    正在参加昆明部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表们欢欣鼓舞地说，发射导弹核武器试验成功靠的是毛泽东思想。我们一定要把这个大喜讯变成更好地学习毛主席著作的新的鼓舞力量。代表们决定专门安排时间开讨论会、讲用会，就这个大喜讯，大谈精神和物质、政治和业务的关系，进一步提高对毛泽东思想的认识，提高对突出政治伟大意义的认识。代表们立即行动起来，采取会内学习与会外宣传相结合的办法，迅速掀起一个宣传毛泽东思想的新高潮。一部分代表还组织了报告队，到附近部队和机关作报告，介绍学习毛主席著作的经验，促进部队更好地活学活用毛主席著作。广州部队某部部分团以上领导干部，正在学习毛主席著作先进单位、某团运输队参观学习，喜讯传来，大家最热烈地欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，学习先进经验、学好毛主席著作的劲头更大了。他们和运输队的战士一起值勤，一起座谈怎样活学活用“老三篇”。他们表示一定要把运输队的经验学到手，学好、用好“老三篇”，狠抓世界观的改造，用领导的思想革命化，来带动部队的革命化，加速我军革命化建设。北京部队某部七连指战员，听到喜讯的当天下午，指导员又一次向全连干部战士宣讲了林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段的指示，对照检查，找出前一阶段学习中的差距，决心把“老三篇”作为座右铭，反复学反复用，真正树立起“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的共产主义世界观。
    在大喜讯的鼓舞下，许多部队指战员专门研究了如何进一步学好用好毛主席著作的问题，他们提出了新的要求，采取了新的措施，决心把学习毛主席著作抓的更紧，更讲究落实。参加南京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表们，纷纷检查并重新修订了自己的学习计划。驻海南岛部队学习毛主席著作某先进单位的全体干部战士，听到喜讯后，立即举行了座谈会，表示要虚心向参加发射导弹核武器试验的同志们学习。这个单位的全体干部战士还到驻地附近的生产大队，和贫下中农一起开了活学活用“老三篇”的讲用会，并同大队党支部商定，把军民共开讲用会作为制度固定下来，真正作到互相学习，互相促进，共同把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到新的阶段，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。（附图片）
