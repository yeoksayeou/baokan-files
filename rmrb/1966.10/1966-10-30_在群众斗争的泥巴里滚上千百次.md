On January 28 of this year, I was honored to join the Communist Party of China. At this joyous moment, feelings of happiness and excitement surged through my heart. Reflecting on how I, a city girl, grew into a pre-party member of the Communist Party, I realize that this is all thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao's education and cultivation, and the warm support of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Doujiamiao. It is the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought that illuminated my path forward, and it is Chairman Mao's books that taught me how to live and how to walk the right path.

Four years ago, when I was about to graduate from high school and choose my life's path, Chairman Mao's warm instructions pointed the way for me. Chairman Mao said: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing and actually do combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants."

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, I settled down in Doujiamiao Brigade, Baodi County, Hebei Province.

Coming to the countryside did not mean that I had truly combined with the masses. In the early days, my petty-bourgeois ways clashed with the masses. I did not understand them, and they did not understand me. At this time, I turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao said: "Intellectuals need to combine with the masses and serve the masses, and this requires a process of mutual understanding. This process will inevitably involve many difficulties and frictions, but as long as everyone has the determination, these goals can be achieved." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me boundless strength, making me begin to put down my intellectual airs and genuinely become a student of the masses, willingly accepting hardships and tempering myself.

In the great classroom of struggling against nature, I fought alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly learning from them. We worked together to drain water, carry manure, plow fields, and harvest crops. We transformed uneven dry land into fields that are resistant to both drought and waterlogging, turning overgrown wastelands into terraced fields with crisscrossing ditches. Around the village, we planted rows of willows and poplars, and entire groves of fruit trees. We erected power poles, installed electric mills, water pumps, and electric lights...

I witnessed with my own eyes the tremendous changes taking place in Doujiamiao. Through long-term joint labor, the poor and lower-middle peasants not only taught me many farming techniques but, more importantly, their noble qualities gradually infected me and deeply educated me. My thoughts, feelings, interests, and hobbies began to undergo qualitative changes. Dealing with manure and mud all day, covered in sweat and dirt, I did not feel dirty; instead, I felt this was the most glorious thing. A piece of clothing with twenty or thirty patches did not make me feel "shabby"; instead, I felt most comfortable wearing such clothes. It was then that I truly came to love the poor and lower-middle peasants, truly understood them, and no longer found them "rustic." They, in turn, came to understand me more and more, liked me more and more, and no longer said I was "foreign." Gradually, I formed a deep revolutionary bond with the poor and lower-middle peasants of Doujiamiao.

On the path of combining with workers and peasants, I have only just taken my first steps, and there is still a long way to go before I can cultivate myself into a successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The reason I have achieved some successes in this regard is that I have read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words. I and some young people in the village, in addition to using the people's school and club to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, also organized many study groups for Chairman Mao's works. I served as the study guide. Some days ago, when I was sick and in the hospital, I organized a study group with my fellow patients, bringing up the active thoughts that arose during my illness and studying Chairman Mao's works with everyone every day. Reading Chairman Mao's books has become my first need in life.

I often think: What does it take to be a pure Communist Party member? After repeatedly studying the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I understood that to be a pure Communist Party member, one must be like Norman Bethune, with no selfishness, extremely responsible in work, and extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people. I am determined to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly learning from Norman Bethune. During the summer harvest, when I was sick, but when I thought of "the wheat is ripe for just a moment," and thought of Norman Bethune risking his life to save wounded soldiers, I felt full of energy and finally, despite my illness, I persisted in pulling out the last sheaf of wheat. During my illness in the hospital, I actively cared for my fellow patients, helping those with mobility difficulties to fetch water, buy food, empty bedpans, comb hair, and wash faces. I feel that these things are indeed small, but as long as I insist on doing them at all times and in all places, and constantly demand of myself the high standard of serving the people wholeheartedly, my worldview will undergo a fundamental change.

Chairman Mao said: "We Communist Party members should face the wind and rain, see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." Our generation grew up under the red flag, eating honey, and has not experienced the bitterness of being oppressed and exploited, nor do we understand the seriousness of class struggle. To temper ourselves into a strong Communist in the great storm of class struggle, in April of this year, I participated in the "Four Clean-ups" campaign in Xianghe County. On the front line of class struggle, when I saw with my own eyes the old poor peasant Wang Yushan denouncing how, in the evil old society, the landlord took away his three mu of rented land, forcing his entire family to beg for food, it further aroused my hatred for the class enemy, further strengthened my feelings for my class brothers, and raised my class consciousness. I am determined to temper myself in the great waves of class struggle to become even stronger.

Over the past four years, it is Chairman Mao who has led me onto the revolutionary path, learning the art of swimming in the great waves, tempering my courage and will to struggle. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in my heart. In the future, I am determined to more consciously read Chairman Mao's books, always, in all things and places, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good student of Chairman Mao. Now, Chairman Mao is personally leading the people of the entire country in a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution. The revolutionary situation is excellent. The old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from the old society are being swept away by the revolutionary masses with an iron broom. I am determined to learn the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and rebel from the revolutionary young people, learn the "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao, take the lead in thoroughly criticizing the old and establishing the new in the countryside, and firmly occupy the ideological and cultural positions in the countryside with Mao Zedong Thought.

    在群众斗争的泥巴里滚上千百次
    侯隽
    今年一月二十八日，我光荣地参加了中国共产党。在这幸福的时刻，高兴，激动，种种感情都涌上了我的心头。想想我从一个城市姑娘成长为一个中共预备党员，这都是党和毛主席教育、培养的结果，是窦家桥广大贫下中农热情帮助的结果。是毛泽东思想的阳光，给我照亮了前进的道路，是毛主席的书教导我懂得了人该怎样生活，路该怎样走。
    四年前，正当我高中毕业，选择生活道路的时候，毛主席的亲切教导给我指明了方向。毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”我按照毛主席的指示，到河北宝坻县窦家桥大队安家落户了。
    到了乡下，并不等于就是和群众结合在一起了。在最初的日子里，我那一套小资产阶级的东西与群众格格不入。我不了解群众，群众也不了解我。这时候，我就请教毛主席著作。毛主席说：“知识分子要和群众结合，要为群众服务，需要一个互相认识的过程。这个过程可能而且一定会发生许多痛苦，许多磨擦，但是只要大家有决心，这些要求是能够达到的。”毛主席的教导给我增添了无穷的力量，使我开始放下了知识分子的臭架子，愿意真心实意地当群众的小学生，自觉地接受艰苦的锻炼。
    在同自然作斗争的大课堂里，我和贫下中农一起战斗，虚心地向他们学习。我们一起排水运粪、耪地收割，一起把高低不平的旱地改造成旱涝保收的园田，把荒草遍野的涝洼碱地改造成沟渠纵横的台田，在村庄的周围栽上了一行行的杨、柳和成片的果树，竖起了一根根电线杆，装上了电磨、抽水机，安上了电灯……。我亲眼看见窦家桥正在发生巨大的变化。在长期的共同劳动中，贫下中农不但教会了我许多农活技术，尤其重要的是，他们的许多高贵品质，渐渐地感染了我，深深地教育了我。我的思想感情、兴趣爱好，开始发生质的变化。成天同粪土和泥巴打交道，一身汗水，一身泥巴，我并不觉得脏，反而觉得这最光荣。一件衣服上补了二十几块补钉，我并不觉得“寒伧”，反而觉得穿这样的衣服最舒服。这时，我才真正爱上了贫下中农，真正了解了他们，再也不嫌他们“土气”了；而他们也越来越了解我，越来越喜欢我，再也不说我“洋气”了。慢慢地，我和窦家桥的贫下中农结下了深厚的革命情谊。
    在和工农结合的大道上，我还只是刚刚迈开了脚步，距离把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人还差得很远。我所以在这方面取得了一些成绩，都是因为读了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话。我和村里的一些青年，除了利用民校、俱乐部宣传毛泽东思想以外，还组织了许多学习毛主席著作小组，我担任了学习辅导员。前些日子我生病住院，就和病友们一起组织了学习小组，带着生病中出现的一些活思想，天天和大家一起学毛主席著作。读毛主席的书，已经成了我生活的第一需要。
    我常想：怎样做，才算得上是个纯粹的共产党员？反复学习《纪念白求恩》一文后，我懂得了，要做一个纯粹的共产党员，必须像白求恩那样毫无自私自利之心，对工作极端的负责，对同志对人民极端的热忱。我决心按照毛主席的教导办，虚心向白求恩学习。今年夏收大忙的时候，我正闹病，但是当我想到“麦熟一晌”，想到白求恩冒着生命危险抢救伤病员的时候，只觉得浑身有使不完的劲，终于带病坚持拔完了最后一把麦子。在生病住院期间，我主动关心病友，替行动困难的病友打水、买饭、倒便盆、梳头、洗脸。我觉得，这些事情固然很小，但是只要随时随地坚持这样做，经常用全心全意为群众服务的高标准要求自己，就会使自己的世界观发生根本的转变。
    毛主席说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”我们这一代，是在红旗下吃着蜜糖长大的，没有受过被压迫、被剥削的苦，不懂得阶级斗争的严重意义。为了在阶级斗争的大风雨里，把自己锻炼成为一名坚强的共产主义战士，今年四月我参加了香河县的四清工作。在阶级斗争的前线，当我亲眼看到老贫农王玉山控诉在罪恶的旧社会，地主夺去了他的三亩租地，逼得他全家讨饭时，更加激起了我对阶级敌人的恨，更加增强了我对阶级兄弟的感情，提高了我的阶级觉悟。我决心在阶级斗争的大风浪里把自己锻炼得更坚强。
    四年来，是毛主席带领我走上革命的道路，在大风大浪中学习革命的游泳术，锻炼勇敢精神和斗争意志。毛主席是我心中最红最红的红太阳。今后我决心更自觉地读毛主席的书，时时、事事、处处按照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。现在，毛主席亲自领导着全国人民进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。革命形势好得很。旧社会遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，正在被革命群众用铁扫帚加以扫除。我决心学习革命小将们敢想、敢说、敢做、敢造反的革命精神，学习毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，带头在农村中大破四旧，大立四新，用毛泽东思想牢固地占领农村的思想阵地和文化阵地。
