The Tibetan farmers of Paril, known as the "Roof of the World's Dazhai," have, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in practice. They have achieved a bumper harvest for the third time this year, with the total output exceeding that of last year by more than three times.

Paril is located at an altitude of 4,200 meters in the Himalayas, where natural conditions are very harsh. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Paril dared to struggle against nature and overcame numerous difficulties to achieve this year's bumper harvest.

    “世界屋脊上的大寨”
    帕里又获大面积丰收
    据新华社拉萨十六日电　被称为“世界屋脊上的大寨”——帕里的藏族翻身农民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，今年第三次获得大面积丰收，总产量超过去年三倍多。
    帕里地处海拔四千二百米的喜马拉雅山区，自然条件很差。用毛泽东思想武装起来的帕里人民，敢于与天斗与地斗，终于战胜重重困难夺得今年的大丰收。
