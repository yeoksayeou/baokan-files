The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry has exposed a new trick of U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialists' trick of stopping the bombing of the eastern part of the demilitarized zone is a preparation for expanding their military adventure.

	NEW DELHI, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on Oct. 11 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of the demilitarized zone and their recent trick of "stopping" the bombing of the eastern part of the demilitarized zone.

	The statement pointed out that in the demilitarized zone, U.S. imperialists frequently sent aircraft, including B-52s, to bomb indiscriminately. They launched large-scale "sweeps" in the southern part of the demilitarized zone and dropped chemical poisons and conducted extremely barbaric bombings in various villages and towns in the northern part of the demilitarized zone, including the Hien Luong Bridge area. The U.S. imperialists also threatened to occupy the demilitarized zone and landed troops north of the 17th Parallel in the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The statement said that after committing these heinous crimes, the United States has recently played tricks by stopping the bombing of the eastern part of the demilitarized zone. It also attempted to use the International Control Commission to legalize its evil deeds in the demilitarized zone. At the same time, it tried to use the above methods to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and prepare public opinion for its new evil deeds in the demilitarized zone and its northern regions.

	The statement emphasized that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the U.S. Government must completely stop all bombing in the entire demilitarized zone and completely stop all other military activities on the ground, rivers, and in the air; must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; must stop invading South Vietnam and withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam.

    越南外交部揭穿美帝的新花招
    美帝停炸非军事区东段的把戏是为扩大军事冒险作准备
    新华社河内十一日电  越南民主共和国外交部发言人十一日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义接连轰炸非军事区的罪行和最近玩弄“停止”轰炸非军事区东部地区的把戏。
    声明指出，在非军事区，美帝国主义经常派遣飞机，包括Ｂ—52型飞机在内，接连到处进行轰炸。它向非军事区南部地区发动了多次大规模的“扫荡”，同时向非军事区北部各个乡、村，甚至贤良桥地区撒放化学毒药和进行极其野蛮的轰炸。美帝国主义还威胁说，要占领非军事区，并且派兵在十七度线以北的越南民主共和国领土登陆。
    声明说，美国在犯下这些滔天罪行以后，最近几天又玩弄停止轰炸非军事区东部地区的把戏。它还企图利用国际委员会来使它在非军事区的罪恶行动合法化。同时，它妄图以上述手段，诬蔑越南民主共和国，为它在非军事区及其北部地区的新的罪恶行动进行舆论准备。
    声明强调指出，越南民主共和国政府要求美国政府必须完全停止在整个非军事区进行的轰炸，完全停止在地面、河流和天空的其它一切军事活动；必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其它一切战争活动；必须停止侵略越南南方，从越南南方全部撤出美国及其仆从国军队。
