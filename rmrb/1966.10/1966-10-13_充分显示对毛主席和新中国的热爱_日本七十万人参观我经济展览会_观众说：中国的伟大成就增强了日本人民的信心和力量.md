According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th: Tokyo news: In recent days, the broad masses of the Japanese people have enthusiastically visited the China Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Kitakyushu City. In the first ten days of the exhibition, the number of visitors has exceeded 700,000. This fully demonstrates the Japanese people's boundless love for Chairman Mao Zedong and New China, and shows that the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is deeply rooted in people's hearts.

People from various strata in Japan have, after visiting the exhibition, enthusiastically praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao in socialist construction, and praised the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought. One visitor wrote in the exhibition's guestbook:

"Following the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people have achieved remarkable achievements, which have given us Japanese people a strong force. We deeply feel that we must also strive for the early construction of a beautiful society."

Another visitor enthusiastically said that the exhibition shows the great achievements made by New China in socialist construction over the past 17 years, "which made me feel the greatness of Marxism-Leninism, and the greatness of the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese Communist Party. Long live the Chinese people! Long live Sino-Japanese friendship!"

The China Economic and Trade Exhibition has attracted a wide range of Japanese people to visit, greatly deepening the Japanese people's understanding of New China, and making the friendship between the peoples of the two countries more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Among the visitors, there are not only people from nearby areas such as Fukuoka, Saga, Kumamoto, and Yamaguchi, but also people who have traveled from distant places like Kagoshima at the southern end of Kyushu and Okayama and Shimane in Honshu. The exhibition has seen many local workers, employees, and women carrying baskets and children visiting during their lunch breaks.
