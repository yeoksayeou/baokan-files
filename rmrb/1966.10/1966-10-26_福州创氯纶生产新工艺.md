Workers at the Fuzhou Synthetic Fiber Factory, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have broken away from superstitions, dared to think and act boldly, and pioneered a new, faster, better, and more economical method for producing chlorine fiber. This has contributed to meeting the clothing needs of the broad masses of people and expanding the production of industrial fabrics. The factory primarily uses the abundant limestone, salt, and coke resources of Fujian Province to produce chlorine fiber. Chlorine fiber is more durable than cotton and warmer than wool, with characteristics such as low water absorption, good wrinkle resistance, light weight, resistance to mold and insects, making it highly suitable for workers, peasants, and soldiers to make clothing. This fiber is also resistant to acids and alkalis, and has good insulation properties, making it suitable for special industrial fabrics.

    福州创氯纶生产新工艺
    福州合成纤维厂职工在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下，破除迷信，敢想敢闯，在氯纶的生产方法上闯出了一条新的多快好省的道路，为满足广大人民穿衣需要和扩大工业用布生产作出了贡献。这个厂主要用福建省极丰富的石灰石、盐、焦炭等作原料，生产氯纶纤维。氯纶纤维比棉花耐磨，比羊毛保暖，具有吸水性小、抗皱性好、轻便、不霉、不蛀等特性，很适合广大工农兵制作衣服。这种纤维还耐酸、耐碱、绝缘性好，适于作工业上的特殊用布。
