Many Yemeni workers cherish the days they spent with Chinese experts as an unforgettable happiness in their lives. They say, "We thank the Chinese experts, and we are even more grateful to the great leader Mao Zedong who taught the Chinese experts."

At the behest of the 700 million Chinese people, and with the teachings of the great leader Mao Zedong, Chinese experts came to the Yemen Arab Republic to help the Yemeni people build a textile factory. In just two years, they worked alongside Yemeni workers to not only complete the construction of a modern, comprehensive cotton spinning, weaving, and dyeing factory in Sana'a, but also shared the hardships with the local people, finding every possible way to ensure that Yemeni workers fully mastered the technology. They helped Yemen train over 800 technical workers in civil engineering and textiles. Now, in this factory, known as the "Sino-Yemeni Friendship Building," people can hear everywhere the enthusiastic praise of Yemeni workers for the brotherly friendship between the Chinese experts and Yemeni workers, and for the selfless sharing of technology by the Chinese experts. Many Yemeni workers regard the days they spent with the Chinese experts as an unforgettable happiness in their lives. They say, "We thank the Chinese experts, and we are even more grateful to the great leader Mao Zedong who taught the Chinese experts."

From the beginning of the project, the Chinese experts faced difficulties such as language barriers, lack of technical personnel, and the challenge of adapting to the high-altitude climate. In the face of these difficulties, they repeatedly recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them the great strength to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. When faced with language barriers, the experts would demonstrate personally, teaching by example. If the Yemeni workers did not understand after one lesson, they would teach again, and again, and again... until the Yemeni workers were satisfied with their mastery of the operation. From construction to machine installation, from factory economic accounting to administrative management, for all the engineering and administrative personnel needed by the factory, the Chinese experts did everything possible to train them one by one.

Many Yemeni workers, after mastering the technology, gratefully said, "The Chinese experts truly understand our difficulties and our feelings. The Chinese experts help us sincerely." A Yemeni worker named Ali said, "What makes me happy is that the Chinese experts teach their wisdom and technology to Yemeni workers without reservation. What impresses me the most is that the Chinese experts, in their work, always follow Chairman Mao's instructions to help Yemen in its construction."

Yemeni workers unanimously praised the work style and living style of the Chinese experts in their joint labor. An old worker named Ahmed Naji said, "The Chinese experts, in their work, are not only active but also proactive. Where there are difficulties, they go. They especially respect Yemeni workers, never get angry, and treat people equally and kindly. I have dealt with many foreigners, but I have never seen anyone as good as the Chinese experts."

In the days they spent with the Chinese experts, Yemeni workers not only learned technology but also saw the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought from the experts. From their personal experiences, they increasingly felt that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world today. Now, more and more Yemeni workers love Chairman Mao and read his works. A worker named Ali, after reading a book by Chairman Mao, said, "Chairman Mao's books serve the people. Every sentence in the book is the truth of revolution and anti-imperialism. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest thought."

    毛主席派来的好专家
    许多也门工人把同中国专家相处的日子，当作他们终生难忘的幸福。他们说：“我们感谢中国专家，更感谢教导中国专家的伟大领袖毛主席。”
    中国专家受七亿中国人民的委托，带着伟大领袖毛主席的教导，来到阿拉伯也门共和国，帮助也门人民建设纺织工厂。在短短两年内，他们同也门工人一道，不但把一座现代化的综合性的萨那棉纺织印染厂的厂房盖起来了，而且还同当地群众同甘共苦，想方设法使也门工人充分掌握技术，帮助也门培养了八百多名土木建筑和纺织方面的技术工人。现在，在这个被称为“中也友谊大厦”的工厂里，人们到处可以听到也门工人热情赞扬毛主席派来的中国专家和也门工人结成兄弟般的友谊，中国专家无私地向也门工人传授技术。许多也门工人把同中国专家相处的日子，当作他们终生难忘的幸福。他们说：“我们感谢中国专家，更感谢教导中国专家的伟大领袖毛主席。”
    工程一开始，中国专家就面临着语言不通，技术力量缺乏，以及不适应高原气候的困难。他们在困难面前，一再重温毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”毛主席的教导给予他们排除万难，争取胜利的巨大力量。语言不通，专家就现身说法，亲自把着手教。教一次不会，就再作一次，两次，三次……直到也门工人满意地学会操作为止。从土建到机器安装，从工厂的经济核算到行政管理，凡是这个工厂需要的一切工程技术和行政管理人员，中国专家都想尽办法为他们一一培训。
    许多也门工人在掌握了技术之后感激地说：“中国专家真正懂得我们的困难，了解我们的心情。中国专家帮助我们是真心诚意的。”一位名叫阿里的也门工人说：“我感到幸福的是：中国专家毫无保留地把自己的智慧和技术教给也门工人。最使我钦佩的是：中国专家在工作中，始终贯彻毛主席的指示，帮助也门进行建设。”
    也门工人也异口同声地赞扬中国专家在同也门工人一起劳动中的工作作风和生活作风。一位名叫艾哈迈德·纳吉的老工人说：“中国专家在工作中，不但积极，而且主动，哪里有困难，他们就到哪里去。他们特别尊重也门工人，从来不发火，待人既平等又和蔼。我同许多外国人打过交道，但从来没有见过像中国专家这样好。”
    也门工人在同中国专家相处的日子里，不但学到了技术，同时也从专家的身上看到了毛泽东思想的伟大。他们从自己的亲身经历中越来越体会到毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是当代全世界革命人民的伟大导师。现在越来越多的也门职工热爱毛主席，爱读毛主席的著作。一位名叫阿里的工人，在读完一本毛主席的著作之后说：“毛主席的书是为人民服务的，书中每一句话都是革命反帝的真理。毛泽东思想是最伟大的思想。”
