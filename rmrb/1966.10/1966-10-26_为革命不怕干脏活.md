I come from a poor peasant family and was raised as a child bride. At the age of eighteen, I started pushing the night soil cart and emptying chamber pots. In the past, I always thought that my fate was miserable, so I had to do this dirty and smelly job. After liberation, I also thought about not doing this work anymore. Later, under the Party's education and especially after studying Chairman Mao's works, my class consciousness was raised. I understood that today, pushing the night soil cart and emptying chamber pots is different from the old society. It is for serving the people, for accumulating fertilizer for agriculture, and for improving the sanitary environment for residents. It is revolutionary work. Therefore, I made up my mind to work on the sanitation front for life and serve the people wholeheartedly.

Chairman Mao said: "Our army is a people's army. It is an army for the people. It is an army that is completely and thoroughly for the people's interests." Chairman Mao's words are deeply engraved in my mind. I always strictly require myself according to Chairman Mao's teachings. To achieve "completely" and "thoroughly," our team has investigated the situation of 1,743 households: how many are dual-income families, which families have elderly mothers who need care, which families have people who are inconvenienced or blind, etc. Based on different situations, we provide specific help.

Once, during a heavy storm with deep water on the roads, the cart could not be pushed into the alley. If the residents brought out their chamber pots to be emptied, many would get their clothes wet. I thought, if anyone has to get wet, let it be me. I went back and forth in the water for over three hours, emptying more than 200 chamber pots.

With the thought of serving the people, I am not afraid of the smell or the dirt in my work. One winter morning, the northwest wind was howling, and the temperature was below zero. At the Xujiahui night soil wharf, we were busy unloading night soil. Suddenly, the pipe from the night soil pit to the night soil boat froze and cracked, and the night soil flowed into the river. The high-quality fertilizer we had just obtained would be wasted. Moreover, the night soil flowing into the river would spread diseases. I quickly took off my trousers and shoes, jumped into the night soil pit, grabbed the wooden plug, and with all my strength, plugged the crack in the pipe.

I follow Chairman Mao's words and have only done what I should for the residents. The masses, however, have given me great honor and have done their best to help me. An old grandmother with white hair, regardless of wind or rain, always waits at the high slope by the alley entrance to help me push the cart past. Seeing all this, I feel even more that only dirty thoughts are dirty, not the work. The truly dirty thing is the exploitative class's contempt for labor and the laboring people, and the bourgeois individualist thought. Serving the people, no matter what work you do, is glorious.

    为革命不怕干脏活
    上海徐汇区清洁工　孙小花
    我出身在贫农家庭，从小当童养媳，十八岁就推粪车、倒马桶。过去总认为自己命苦，才做这种又脏又臭的活。解放后，也曾想不再干这个工作。后来，在党的教育下，特别是学了毛主席著作以后，提高了阶级觉悟，懂得了今天推粪车、倒马桶和旧社会不同，是在为人民服务，为农业积肥料，为居民改善环境卫生，干的是革命工作。因此，我下定决心要在清洁工作岗位上干一辈子，全心全意为人民服务。
    毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席的话，印在我脑子里，我时时刻刻以毛主席的教导严格要求自己。为了做到“完全”“彻底”，我们小组摸清了一千七百四十三户居民的情况：有多少双职工，哪家有无人照顾的老妈妈，哪家有行动不便或双目失明的人，等等。根据不同的对象，进行具体帮助。
    有一次，狂风暴雨，路上积水很深，车子推不进弄堂。如果让居民把马桶送出来倒，很多人都要淋湿衣服。我想，要湿就湿我一个人。我来来往往在水里整整忙了三个多小时，倒了二百多只马桶。
    有了为人民服务的思想，在工作中就能不怕臭，不怕脏。有一个冬天的早晨，西北风呼呼地吹着，气温在零度以下。徐家汇粪码头上，正忙着卸粪。忽然，粪池通向粪船的管子冻裂了，大粪直往河里淌。已经到手的优质肥料，让它白白流掉多可惜。再说，大粪流到河里，还会传染疾病。我连忙脱下长裤和鞋袜，跳进粪坑，抓住木塞，用全力塞住了管子裂口。
    我听毛主席的话，为居民只做了一些我应该做的事，群众却给了我很大的荣誉，还想尽办法帮助我。有个白发苍苍的老妈妈，不管刮风下雨，总是等在弄堂口的高坡旁，帮助我把车子推过去。看到这一切，我更加体会到，只有肮脏的思想，没有肮脏的工作。真正脏的，不是推粪车倒马桶的工作，而是轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的剥削阶级思想，是资产阶级个人主义思想。为人民服务，不论做什么工作，都是光荣的。
