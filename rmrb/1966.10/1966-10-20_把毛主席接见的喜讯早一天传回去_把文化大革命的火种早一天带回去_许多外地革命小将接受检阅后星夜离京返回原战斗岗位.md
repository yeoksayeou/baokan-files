	Many revolutionary youngsters from outside Beijing, after being inspected by Chairman Mao, hurried back to their original battlefields.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, a large number of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country who came to Beijing for revolutionary connections were filled with joy and high spirits after being inspected by the great leader Chairman Mao yesterday. Many of them returned to their original battlefields that very night. The revolutionary youngsters were eager to spread the joyous news one day earlier and to bring the spark of the revolution back one day earlier. They firmly declared: They would definitely defend and carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	In the afternoon of the 18th, as soon as the reception ended, many revolutionary youngsters from various places rushed to the train station with enthusiasm. They made the most of the time before boarding the train to send telegrams to their comrades and families, reporting the joyous news of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao, so that more people could share this honor and happiness with them. Some, on their way to the train station, once again came to Tiananmen Square, standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to solemnly vow: Dearest leader Chairman Mao, rest assured, we will definitely follow your words, resolutely defend and carry out the proletarian revolutionary line you represent. Anyone who opposes this revolutionary line, anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely and thoroughly overthrow them. Many revolutionary youngsters who came to Tiananmen Square to bid farewell gazed longingly at the Tiananmen Gate Tower where Chairman Mao had stood. They said: Every minute we spend by Chairman Mao's side is incredibly happy, but we cannot stay away from our posts for too long. The tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are waiting for us, and we must quickly return to join the battle.

	That night, on the brightly lit square in front of Beijing Railway Station and on the trains about to leave Beijing, one could see revolutionary youngsters exchanging revolutionary experiences everywhere and hear them expressing their excitement after seeing Chairman Mao.

	More than 400 Red Guards and revolutionary students from various ethnic groups at Xinjiang University, Xinjiang Institute of Technology, Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Agricultural Academy, and Kashgar Normal School sang "The Great Ship Needs a Helmsman" as they walked to the train station. Before boarding, they were still discussing how to fight upon their return. Red Guards from Chengdu Second Normal School and Wuxi Guangrui Middle School left Beijing that very night after seeing Chairman Mao. As the train was about to depart, they excitedly said: "We must take the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of us, the deep affection of the Red Guards and revolutionary masses in the capital, and the spirit of studying Chairman Mao's works and establishing Mao Zedong Thought back to our places, and fight more actively, vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Revolutionary youngsters from the industrial city of Shenyang in Northeast China and the heroic city of Xiamen on the front line in Fujian also performed artistic performances at Tiananmen Square before leaving Beijing, praising the great leader Chairman Mao. The youngsters said: In the current acute and complex class struggle, we must undergo tempering and testing, not retreat in the face of difficulties, and not waver in the face of setbacks. We dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, vowing to defend Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and Mao Zedong Thought with our lives. This is our lifelong mission.

    十八日下午，当接见刚结束，来自各地的许多革命小将就满怀激情地奔向车站。他们抓紧上车前的时刻，纷纷发电报给自己的战友和亲人，报告见到伟大领袖毛主席的喜讯，让更多的人和他们共享这一崇高的荣誉和幸福。有的在去车站的途中，又一次来到天安门广场，站在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，你放心吧，我们一定听你的话，坚决捍卫和执行你所代表的无产阶级革命路线。谁要反对这条革命路线，谁要反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决彻底把他打倒。来到天安门广场告别的许多革命小将留恋不舍地久久仰望着毛主席站过的天安门城楼。他们说：我们在毛主席身边多呆一分钟也感到无比幸福，可是我们不能离开自己的岗位太久，无产阶级文化大革命的斗争任务等待着我们，我们要尽快地回去投入战斗。
    当晚，在灯火通明的北京车站站前广场上，在一列列即将离开北京的火车上，到处都可以见到革命小将们在交流革命经验，到处都可以听到革命小将们表达见到毛主席以后激动心情的话语。
    新疆大学、新疆工学院、新疆生产建设兵团农学院、喀什师专等大中院校的四百多名各族红卫兵和革命师生，一边走一边高歌《大海航行靠舵手》，来到火车站。上车前，他们还在热烈地讨论着回去怎样战斗。成都市第二师范学校和无锡市广瑞中学的红卫兵小将在见到毛主席以后，连夜离京踏上征途。当列车快要开动的时候，他们激动地说：“我们一定要把毛主席接见我们的喜讯，把首都红卫兵和革命群众对我们的深情厚意，把首都革命群众大学毛主席著作、大立毛泽东思想的精神带回去，更加积极地投入战斗，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。来自东北工业城市沈阳和福建前线英雄城市厦门的革命小将，在离开北京前还到天安门广场进行了文艺演出，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席。小将们说：在当前尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们要经受锻炼和考验，遇到困难不退缩，受到挫折不动摇，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，这是我们毕生的战斗任务。
