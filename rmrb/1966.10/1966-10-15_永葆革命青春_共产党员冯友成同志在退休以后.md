Editor's Note: Retired revolutionary cadre and Communist Party member Feng Youcheng, though old in age, remains steadfast in his revolutionary spirit. He sets a high standard for himself, striving to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." He continues to work diligently for the Party and the people, setting a fine example for retired cadres.

Chairman Mao has said: "It is not difficult for a person to do some good deeds, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, to do no bad deeds, to be consistently beneficial to the broad masses, to be consistently beneficial to the youth, to be consistently beneficial to the revolution, to struggle hard for decades as if it were just one day. This is the most difficult thing of all!" Feng Youcheng comrade is precisely following Chairman Mao's teachings, consistently doing good deeds for the Party and the people. Whether in office or retired, he dedicates all his wisdom and strength to the magnificent cause of communism.

In our Party, there are many good comrades like Feng Youcheng. The fundamental reason they can maintain their revolutionary youth is that they persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, constantly transforming their worldview, and strengthening their ideological revolutionization. It is Chairman Mao's affectionate guidance that has enabled Feng Youcheng to grow from an ordinary shepherd into a Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre with a high level of proletarian consciousness, who can always broaden his horizons, advance steadfastly, and maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit in any situation.

Over the past year, some revolutionary old cadres from Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, have returned home to retire. Among them is Feng Youcheng, known as the "Flying Legs" and "Shepherd County Magistrate" during the War of Resistance. He has a heart dedicated to the revolution. He said: "People may retire, but their thoughts should not retire!" He voluntarily went to the county committee and suggested that twelve retired cadres form a separate Party branch. Everyone elected Feng Youcheng as the branch secretary.

After the Party branch was established, Feng Youcheng used his savings to subscribe to several newspapers and magazines. The branch set up some practical and feasible systems. To ensure that everyone studies seriously and well, and to achieve active learning and application, Feng Youcheng led everyone in collective study of Chairman Mao's works, frequently exchanging learning experiences. He himself continued to study at home, reading Chairman Mao's works every morning and reading newspapers and other revolutionary books in the evening. When he encountered important articles, he often read until late at night. His wife, Gao Ronghua, worried about his health, repeatedly advised him to read less. He optimistically said: "Reading more, knowing more about revolutionary principles, and understanding more about domestic and international affairs will make one's mind clear and eyes bright, which is good for one's health and has no bad effects." Feng Youcheng's spirit of studying for the revolution influenced and inspired other retired comrades, who also subscribed to the "Red Flag" magazine and newspapers.

Feng Youcheng not only pays attention to improving his own ideology but also sets strict requirements for others. At the beginning of collective study, a few comrades emphasized, "We didn't study well when we were young, it's no use now!" "We are retired, whether we study or not is the same, anyway, we can't contribute to the revolution anymore." After hearing these words, he organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works such as "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose Liberalism," and "Organize." He also told everyone, "We may be old, but our thoughts should not be old. Even if our bodies are weak, our mouths should not be idle. If we study well, we can be useful, lecturing to students, to the youth, to poor and lower-middle peasants, keeping the revolutionary ranks forever vigorous and advancing. To do these things well, we must rely on studying Chairman Mao's works; if we do not study, we will fall behind Mao Zedong Thought and make mistakes."

Under his help and enlightenment, eleven old comrades have consistently adhered to the Tuesday and Thursday study system. Initially, a few comrades raised some inappropriate demands in terms of life. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, they not only solved these problems but also further raised their awareness, expressing their willingness to continue doing good deeds for the Party and the people.

Before returning home to retire, Feng Youcheng first thought that as a farmer, he should contribute to changing the face of Pinglu. He bought a pickaxe, two straw mats, a straw coat, three baskets, two shovels, two manure forks, and a load of baskets; he went up the mountain to collect seeds of twenty kinds of trees such as fir, spruce, and pine; he also bought seeds of cotton and more than ten other economic crops, all of which he brought back. He took the lead in organizing other retired cadres to plant more than two mu of land, engaging in agricultural and forestry scientific experiments. Someone said to him, "Old Feng, you are really strange, giving up a comfortable life to do these things for what?" Feng Youcheng smiled and said, "Farmers, if they forget their trade, can they still be called farmers? If we succeed with these things, Pinglu will become like the south of the Yangtze River!" Everyone respectfully said to him, "You are indeed a good comrade, always thinking for the people and the next generation, no matter what time it is. We must learn from your noble communist style."

Feng Youcheng insists on collecting manure all year round. In winter, he wears the dog-skin coat he made in 1942, and before the sun rises, he carries a basket and a load of baskets, braving the bitter cold to collect manure; in the hot summer, he wears a straw hat and collects manure along the streets and alleys. Under his leadership, all the old comrades of the "Honored Rest" branch bought manure collection tools and started collecting manure. In one year, they collected more than ten thousand jin of manure, all of which was used in the experimental fields. This year in June, seeing that his experimental wheat, locust trees, and walnuts were successful, he was very happy. He also used the opportunity of visiting to collect seeds of six kinds of trees such as cypress, locust, and birch from places like Lingqiu, and cultivated them, determined to pave a way for the greening of Pinglu.

The fundamental reason Feng Youcheng can maintain his revolutionary youth and serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly" is that he always insists on studying Chairman Mao's works, constantly transforming his worldview, and raising his class consciousness. He wrote in his notes:

	Chairman Mao's books are read every day, the mind is clear and not lost;
	Chairman Mao's books are read every day, the spirit can be boosted;
	Chairman Mao's books are read every day, difficulties can be overcome;
	Chairman Mao's books are read every day, thoughts can resist poison.

He also wrote: "The revolutionary path is still long, there are still class enemies at home and abroad, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is still long-term, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism will not be over in one go. As long as I have a breath, I can speak, I will read Chairman Mao's works and serve the people for life."

    永葆革命青春
    ——共产党员冯友成同志在退休以后
    中共山西省平鲁县委会
    编者按：退休的革命干部、共产党员冯友成同志，年老心红，不减当年英雄本色。他以“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的高标准要求自己，继续勤勤恳恳地为党为人民工作，为退休干部树立了一个好榜样。
    毛主席说过：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众，一贯的有益于青年，一贯的有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！”冯友成同志正是按照毛主席这样的教导，一贯地为党为人民做好事。在职也好，退休也好，他都能够把自己的全部智慧和力量献给壮丽的共产主义事业。
    在我们党内，像冯友成同志这样的好党员是很多的。他们所以能够永葆革命青春，最根本的一条，就是坚持活学活用毛主席著作，不断地改造自己的世界观，加强自己的思想革命化。正是毛主席的亲切教导，使冯友成同志由一个普通的羊倌成长为一个有高度无产阶级觉悟的共产党员和革命干部，在任何情况下都能够放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进，始终保持着旺盛的革命朝气。
    去年以来，家在山西省平鲁县的一些革命老干部，陆续退休回来了。抗战时期的“飞毛腿”、“羊倌县长”冯友成同志，就是其中的一个。他有一颗为革命的红心。他说：人退休了，思想可不能退休啊！他主动到县委建议，让十二个退休干部单独成立党支部。大家选举冯友成为支部书记。
    党支部成立后，冯友成同志拿出自己的积蓄，订了几份报纸和刊物。支部建立了一些切实可行的制度。为使大家认真学，学的好，做到活学活用，思想永不褪色，冯友成同志领导大家集体学习毛主席著作，经常交流学习心得。他自己回到家里还坚持学习，每天早晨学习毛主席著作，晚上读报、读其他革命书籍。碰上重要文章，他常常看到深夜。他爱人高荣华担心他的身体吃不住，多次劝他少读一些。他乐观地说：“多读书，多看报，多懂得革命的道理，多知道国内外大事，心明眼亮了，对身体只有好处，没有坏处。”冯友成同志这种为革命学习的精神，影响和鼓舞了别的退休的同志，他们也订了《红旗》杂志和报纸。
    冯友成同志不但注意改造提高自己的思想，对别的同志也提出严格要求。在集体学习开始的时候，有几个同志强调说：“年轻时候没学好，现在不顶用啦！”“退休啦，学不学一样，反正对革命再没有啥贡献了。”他听到这些话以后，就组织大家学习毛主席的《整顿党的作风》、《反对自由主义》、《组织起来》等著作。他还对大家说：“我们人老了，思想可不能老。身体不行了，嘴可不能闲住。咱们学好了，用处很大，给学生们讲，给青年们讲，给贫下中农讲，让革命队伍永远旺盛，永远前进。要做好这些工作，就要靠学习毛主席著作；如果不学习，就跟不上毛泽东思想，就要犯错误。”
    十一个老同志在他的帮助和启发下，一直坚持了星期二、四学习的制度。最初，有个别同志在生活方面提出一些不适当的要求。通过学习毛主席著作，他们不但解决了这些问题，而且进一步提高了觉悟，表示要继续为党为人民做好事。
    冯友成同志退休回来之前，首先想到的是自己是庄稼汉出身，应该为平鲁改天换地出一份力量。他买了一把镐、两个棕垫、一件棕衣、三个背篓、两张铁锹、两把粪杈子、一担箩头；上山采集了云杉、冷杉、马尾松等二十种树籽；还买了棉花等十几种经济作物种籽，一并带了回来。他带头组织其他退休干部，种了二亩多地，从事农业、林业科学试验。有人对他说：“老冯，你这人真怪，放着清福不享，折腾这些个干啥？”冯友成同志笑笑说：“庄户人嘛，忘了这行还行？把这些东西搞成功，平鲁不就成了江南啦！”大家对他敬佩地说：“你真是个好同志，不管啥时候，总是为人民为后代着想，我们一定要学习你这种高尚的共产主义风格。”
    冯友成同志坚持常年拾粪。冬天，他穿上那件一九四二年做的狗皮大衣，太阳还没有出山，就背着背篓，挎着箩头，冒着刺骨的寒风拾粪；炎热的夏天，他顶着草帽，沿路串巷拾粪。在他的带领下，“荣休”支部的全体老同志，都买了拾粪工具拾起粪来。一年来，他们拾粪一万余斤，全部上在试验地里。今年六月，看见自己试验的小麦、槐树、核桃成功了，他很高兴，又利用参观的机会，到灵丘等地采集了柏树、槐树、桦树等六种树籽，进行培育，决心为平鲁的绿化闯出一条路来。
    冯友成同志所以能够永葆革命青春，做到“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，根本的原因是他始终坚持学习毛主席著作，不断地改造自己的世界观，提高阶级觉悟。他在笔记里写道：
    毛主席的书天天读，心明不迷路；
    毛主席的书天天读，干劲能鼓足；
    毛主席的书天天读，困难能克服；
    毛主席的书天天读，思想能抗毒。
    他还写道：“革命的路程还很长，国内外还有阶级敌人，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，还是长期的，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，也不是一下会完结的。只要我有口气，能说话，就要读毛主席的著作，为人民服务终身。”
