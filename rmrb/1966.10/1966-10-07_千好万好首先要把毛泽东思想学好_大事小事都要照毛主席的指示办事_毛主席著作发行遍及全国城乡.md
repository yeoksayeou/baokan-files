Nationalwide, in all provinces and autonomous regions, in medium and small cities, and in vast rural and border areas, Chairman Mao's works and portraits were widely distributed before and after National Day. Revolutionary masses of all nationalities who received these revolutionary treasures were overjoyed and sang songs of praise. They excitedly declared: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, infuse them into our blood, and put them into action. No matter how fierce the storms, we will always follow Chairman Mao in making revolution.

During the National Day holiday, the bookstores in Changchun, Harbin, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Guizhou, Kunming, Jinan, Hefei, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Nanchang, and Fuzhou were adorned with lanterns and red flags, presenting a festive atmosphere. According to incomplete statistics, since September, the distribution of various editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in medium and small cities, rural areas, and border regions across the country has exceeded the total distribution of these regions in several previous years, and the coverage is the widest since liberation. Additionally, the distribution of other editions of Chairman Mao's works and portraits has also reached an unprecedented scale.

Revolutionary masses in medium and small cities and rural market towns across the country were jubilant upon receiving revolutionary treasures during the National Day holiday, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" On September 26, in Shaoshan, Hunan Province, the hometown of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When the colorful vehicles loaded with Chairman Mao's works entered Shaoshan, the revolutionary masses on both sides of the road waved red flags and portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums, set off firecrackers, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Mao Fuxuan, the son of the first secretary of the Communist Party of China Shaoshan Branch established by Chairman Mao and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, wrote a quick-verse poem after buying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong": "Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious treasure, use it wherever you go and it will be good, fight against heaven and heaven will bow, fight against earth and earth will yield grain, fight against people and people will change, fight against all ghosts and snakes, and all ghosts and snakes will be swept away."

In the foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, and in Qinghai, Ningxia, Guangxi, and other regions, broad masses of revolutionary minorities received the long-awaited Chairman Mao's works and portraits while celebrating National Day. On the eve of National Day, the Xinjiang Bookstore of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region delivered Chairman Mao's works and portraits to the summer camp of the Huljiltu Production Brigade of Xinjiang People's Commune in Ulanqab League. Male and female herdsmen, dressed in their festive attire, rode horses, drove carts, and herded livestock from all directions to the book-selling point. Herdsmen who received Chairman Mao's works shouted and sang revolutionary songs, performing self-composed "good-come-baos" praising Chairman Mao. Some herdsmen sat down on the spot to study. In Lhasa, a city with a small population on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, over 68,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works in Tibetan and Chinese editions and 80,000 portraits of Chairman Mao were sold in the past month. Many elderly emancipated serfs hung five, ten, or even more portraits of Chairman Mao in their homes. They said, "Only the most miserable people know how sweet today's happy life is. This happiness is all given by Chairman Mao. We can go a day without eating tsampa, but we cannot go a day without reading Chairman Mao's books or seeing Chairman Mao's portraits." During the National Day holiday, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region supplied 1.5 million copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and 650,000 portraits of Chairman Mao. From Nanning to the right bank of the Youjiang River where the Zhuang people reside, from the Dong people's region in the north to the Jing people's fishing port in the north, various nationalities who received the treasures shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and declared, "With the treasure in hand, we follow the Party forever, and we will never change our revolutionary hearts."

    千好万好首先要把毛泽东思想学好  大事小事都要照毛主席的指示办事
    毛主席著作发行遍及全国城乡
    据新华社六日讯　全国各省、自治区的中小城市和广大农村、边疆地区，在国庆节前后都大量发行毛主席著作和毛主席画像。各族革命群众得到革命宝书，莫不欣喜若狂，欢呼歌唱。他们激动地表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，不管狂风巨浪，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。
    国庆节期间，长春、哈尔滨、太原、兰州、郑州、长沙、贵州、昆明、济南、合肥、南京、杭州、南昌、福州等城市的新华书店门市部，张灯结彩，红旗飘扬，呈现了一片喜气洋洋的节日景象。据不完全的统计，全国各中小城市和农村、边疆地区从九月份以来，发行的各种版本《毛泽东选集》超过了这些地区过去好几年的发行总数，供应面也是解放以来最广的一次。此外，发行的其他版本毛主席著作和毛主席画像的数量也是空前的。
    各地中小城市和农村集镇的广大革命群众在欢度国庆期间获得革命宝书，都欢欣鼓舞，高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”九月二十六日，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——湖南湘潭县韶山有数以千计的革命群众买到了《毛泽东选集》和《毛主席语录》等。当满载着毛主席著作的彩车驶入韶山时，公路两旁的革命群众，高举着红旗和毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，鸣放鞭炮，“毛主席万岁，万万岁”的口号声响彻云霄。毛主席亲手建立的中共韶山党支部第一任书记毛福轩烈士的儿子、学习毛主席著作积极分子毛迪秋，买到《毛泽东选集》后，兴奋地写了一首快板诗：“毛泽东思想宝中宝，用到哪里哪里好，与天斗天低头，与地斗地增粮，与人斗人变样，与一切牛鬼蛇神斗，牛鬼蛇神一扫光。”
    在天山脚下，在西藏高原，在内蒙古的草原上，以及青海、宁夏、广西等地区，广大的少数民族革命群众，在欢度国庆的同时，也得到了他们盼望已久的毛主席著作和毛主席画像。国庆节前夕，内蒙古自治区新华书店把毛主席著作和毛主席画像送到了乌兰察布盟新宝力格牧区人民公社呼吉勒图生产大队的夏营地上，男女牧民们穿着节日的盛装，有的骑着马，有的坐大车，有的赶着畜群，从四面八方赶到这里的售书点。得到毛主席著作的牧民们欢呼跳跃，纵情歌唱革命歌曲，并演唱了自己编写的歌颂毛主席的“好来宝”。有些牧民当场席地而坐学习起来。在拉萨这个人口不多的西藏高原城市里，最近一个月内就出售了藏、汉文版毛主席著作六万八千多本，毛主席画像八万多张。许多年老的翻身农奴家里贴了五张、十张，甚至更多的毛主席像。他们说：“最苦的人才懂得今天的幸福生活最甜，这些幸福生活都是毛主席给的。我们一天不吃糌粑可以，一天不读毛主席的书，不见毛主席的像就不行。”国庆节期间，广西壮族自治区供应了《毛泽东选集》、《毛泽东著作选读》、《毛主席语录》等共一百五十多万册，毛主席像六十五万多张。从南宁到壮族聚居的右江河谷，从桂北侗族地区到北部湾京族渔港，得到宝书的各族人民高呼：“毛主席万岁！”表示要“手捧宝书跟党走，永远革命不变心”。
