In the Days of Rescuing Heroes
Excerpts from the Diary of the Medical Leadership Group for Rescuing the Heroic Injured of the 32111 Drilling Team

June 22
	Batch after batch of medical personnel, filled with deep class sentiments, arrived in this remote small city today. They came from different regions, including veteran doctors who have been engaged in burn treatment for many years, as well as young medical workers who have just graduated. We cannot help but recall that in the era of Mao Zedong, wherever there is difficulty, support comes from all directions. An endless force inspires us, and this force is the great Mao Zedong Thought.

June 29
	Two elderly traditional Chinese medicine doctors in their sixties, who came from afar, rushed to the ward as soon as they got off the car yesterday, ignoring the fatigue of a long journey, to consult with the patients. They felt that it was a great honor to treat the heroes nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.
	This morning, they carefully conducted a second consultation for Ruan Shurong. An old doctor movedly said, "I used to only know the phrase 'leaping into the fire and wading into the water,' but today I truly understand what it means. The heroes' spirit of sacrificing themselves to protect state property more than their own lives is something that only exists in the era of Mao Zedong."
	These two old doctors personally go to the pharmacy to get the medicine and personally prepare it each time they write a prescription. When others advised them to rest, they said, "As long as the patients eat more and sleep more, we are willing to endure more hardship."

July 3
	This morning, as the bandages were changed for the patients, the ward resonated with the strong, heroic, and powerful voices reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and singing "The East Is Red."
	Each time the bandages are changed, the patients experience great pain. To distract the patients' attention during the bandage change, the doctors give the patients fruit to eat. Patient Xu Yongmao said, "Nurse, I am an oil worker and I love reading Chairman Mao's works. Please read 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' to me more often." The nurse complied with his request, reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao" each time the bandages are changed, giving him immense spiritual strength to overcome the pain.

July 18
	Mao Zedong's good soldier and the "hard bone" of the working class—Ruan Shurong, with a burn area covering 52.75% of his body, has turned from danger to safety after extensive rescue efforts. At noon, the two chief physicians were so happy that they each ate an extra bowl of rice. In recent days, they were anxious and worried about their class brothers, eating and sleeping poorly. The service staff said, "The expressions on the doctors' faces and their appetite are the 'thermometers' of the patients' condition."
	In capitalist society, the relationship between doctors and patients is based on money. Today, the relationship between doctors and patients is a new proletarian camaraderie. Our common revolutionary goal and guiding ideology—the great Mao Zedong Thought—binds us together.

July 23
	After two skin graft surgeries, Zhang Zhongmin's fingers can move again. He wrote his first letter to Ruan Shurong with immense excitement.
	Although Zhang Zhongmin and Ruan Shurong do not stay in the same ward, Zhang Zhongmin still remembers that he is a party worker, placing himself among the masses and caring for his class brothers politically. He is not only an engineer in the technical sense but also an engineer who uses Mao Zedong Thought to transform himself and the souls of his class brothers. We should learn from him, not only to be doctors who treat wounds but also to be doctors who heal souls.

August 8
	Today, the patients are about to be transferred to the convalescence department and other hospitals. After a period of convalescence, the heroes will return to their battle stations. Who can be joyful and excited? Who can be moved?
	In the morning, two helicopters to transport the patients stopped in front of the hospital. We, along with thousands of local workers, peasants, cadres, and Young Pioneers, rushed to the helicopters, with tears of excitement in our eyes, waving our hands, and bidding a reluctant farewell to our heroes.
	We must bring their revolutionary spirit back to our workplaces, spread it to our comrades, take the heroes as our examples, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, smash the old world, create a new world, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    在抢救英雄的日子里
    抢救32111钻井队英雄伤员医疗领导小组日记摘抄
              六月二十二日
    一批又一批的医务人员，怀着深厚的阶级感情，今天纷纷来到这个偏远的小城。他们来自不同的地区，其中有多年从事烧伤治疗的老医生，也有才出校门不久的青年医务人员。我们不禁联想到，在毛泽东时代，真是一方有困难，八方来支援。一种无穷的力量鼓舞着我们，这力量就是伟大的毛泽东思想。
              六月二十九日
    从远道专程赶来的两位六十岁左右的老中医，昨天一下汽车，不顾长途跋涉的疲劳，就直奔病房，给伤员会诊。他们感到，能为毛泽东思想哺育的英雄治病，是十分光荣的。
    今天上午，他们又细致地给冉树荣进行了第二次会诊。一位老医生感动地说：“我过去只知道赴汤蹈火这个词，今天才知道真有这样的事。英雄们这种爱护国家财产比爱护自己生命还重的英勇牺牲精神，只有毛泽东时代才有。”
    这两位老医师每次开好药方，又亲自到药店抓药，亲自动手煎熬。当别人劝他们休息时，他们说：“只要伤员多吃点饭，多睡点觉，再累点也感到乐意。”
                  七月三日
    今天上午，给伤员换药时，病房里响起了坚强、豪迈、有力的朗读《毛主席语录》的声音和《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声。
    每次换药伤员都很痛苦。医生为了换药时分散伤员的注意力，就给伤员水果吃。伤员许永茂说：“护士同志，我是一个石油工人，最喜欢读毛主席著作。请你多给我读《毛主席语录》吧。”护士按照他的要求，每次换药都读《毛主席语录》，给他增加了战胜伤痛的巨大精神力量。
              七月十八日
    毛主席的好战士、工人阶级的“硬骨头”——冉树荣，全身烧伤面积达百分之五十二点七五，经过多方抢救，转危为安了。中午，两位主治医生高兴得多吃了一碗饭。前些日子，他们都为阶级兄弟焦急不安，吃不好，睡不好。服务员同志说：“医生脸上的表情，饭量大小，是伤员病情的‘体温表’。”
    在资本主义社会，医生和病人是金钱关系。今天，医生和伤员的关系是崭新的无产阶级情谊。共同的革命目标，共同的指导思想——伟大的毛泽东思想，把我们紧紧地联系在一起。
      七月二十三日
    经过两次植皮手术，张仲珉的手指可以活动了。他怀着无比激动的心情，给冉树荣写了第一封信。
    张仲珉和冉树荣尽管不住在一个病房，但是，张仲珉仍然不忘记自己是一个党的工作人员，把自己置身于群众之中，从政治上关心阶级弟兄。他不仅是技术方面的工程师，而且是用毛泽东思想改造自己、也改造阶级兄弟灵魂的工程师。我们要向他学习，不仅要做治疗创伤的医生，更要做人们灵魂的“医生”。
                八月八日
    今天，伤员们就要转到疗养部门和其他医院。英雄们再经过一段疗养，就可以重返战斗岗位了，谁能不欢欣鼓舞，谁能不激动啊！
    上午，接运伤员的两架直升飞机停在医院前面。我们和当地成千上万的工人、农民、机关干部、少先队员赶到飞机前，两眼噙着激动的泪花，挥舞着双手，和我们的英雄依依惜别。
    我们一定要把他们的革命精神带回工作岗位，传播给战友，以英雄为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，砸烂旧世界，创造新世界，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
