Glory to Mao Zedong!

People of Eastern European Countries Express Their Boundless Admiration for Chairman Mao

According to Xinhua News Agency, in recent days, the people of Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria have expressed their boundless love and admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

A resident of Czechoslovakia recently wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "You are the brilliant successor of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. With your creative achievements, you have further developed the advanced ideology of the proletariat, the poor, and the oppressed people of the entire world. You have become the universally recognized leader of the proletarian revolution."

A professor in Prague began his letter with "Long live Mao Zedong!" He wrote passionately: "Mao Zedong has achieved victories in the past, is achieving victories now, and will definitely achieve victories in the future. Glory to Mao Zedong."

A worker said thoughtfully, "I really wish I could go to China to see Comrade Mao Zedong in person and tell him that in Czechoslovakia, workers like me love and support him. May he always be healthy and live long. This is the happiness of the working people of the world."

An elderly worker in the German Democratic Republic who had read many of Chairman Mao's works said: "Mao Zedong is the leader of contemporary communism. He is loved by the people. All revolutionaries must study the works of Mao Zedong."

A farmer said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. China is the future of humanity."

An official said, "Mao Zedong upholds and develops true Marxism-Leninism. He is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought represents the interests of the world proletariat and revolutionary people, and thus can inspire and lead the people forward."

A university student, in praising Mao Zedong Thought, said, "The works of Comrade Mao Zedong are a new development of Marxism-Leninism. The problems arising in the current world revolution can only be found in the works of Comrade Mao Zedong."

An old party member from Hungary said, "Mao Zedong led the Chinese revolution through arduous struggles to achieve today's victories. The entire history of the Chinese revolution proves that Mao Zedong is a great leader. How correct he is!"

A cultural worker said, "I believe that Mao Zedong Thought is not only correct in China but is also applicable throughout the world."

An elderly retired worker said excitedly, "Mao Zedong is the second Lenin. The Soviet revisionists attack Comrade Mao Zedong for leading the Chinese people to make a world revolution. Is it a crime to make a world revolution?"

A technician said, "The Communist Party of China is a true Marxist-Leninist party. Now we place all our hopes in China."

A university student said, "I am studying the works of Mao Zedong and I have come to realize that Mao Zedong Thought is a very correct revolutionary doctrine."

An old party member of the Polish United Workers' Party said, "Comrade Mao Zedong is the great leader and commander of the international communist movement and all the people of the world." He said, "We old communists, whenever we think of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, are filled with hope, firmly believing that communism will break through all difficulties and ultimately achieve complete victory throughout the world."

A Polish composer said, "Mao Zedong Thought has developed Leninism. He is a figure of the times."

A Polish university student said, "To build communism in China, there can only be one thought—Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese are thinking of all the poor people in the world."

In Bulgaria, you can hear the working people everywhere expressing their love and admiration for Chairman Mao. A retired worker said, "Mao Zedong is the contemporary Marx and Lenin. The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the world working class." An old party member proudly said, "I am a member of Mao Zedong's party because the Communist Party of China is a true Marxist-Leninist party." A university student said, "Choosing the path of China, society advances; otherwise, it will regress."

Once, when some Chinese comrades were sightseeing on a mountain, a group of Bulgarian friends immediately ran over to them, shook hands and embraced them warmly. They said enthusiastically, "We love Mao Zedong and support Mao Zedong."

    光荣属于毛泽东！
    东欧国家人民纷纷表达对毛主席的无限敬仰
    据新华社讯　捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、波兰和保加利亚等国的人民群众最近纷纷表达他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和无限敬仰。
    捷克斯洛伐克一位居民不久前在写给毛主席的信中热情地写道：“你是马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的天才继承者，你以创造性的成就进一步发展了整个世界上的无产阶级、穷苦人和被压迫者的先进思想。你成了世界公认的无产阶级革命领袖。”
    布拉格的一位教授在来信中一开头就写着“毛泽东万岁！”信中热情洋溢地写道：“毛泽东过去取得胜利，现在取得胜利，将来也一定取得胜利。光荣属于毛泽东。”
    一位工人语重心长地说，“我真想能去中国，亲眼见一见毛泽东同志，当面告诉他，在捷克斯洛伐克，像我这样的工人都热爱他，拥护他。愿他永远健康、长寿。这是世界劳动人民的幸福。”
    德意志民主共和国的一位曾经读过不少毛主席著作的老工人说：“毛泽东是当代的共产主义领袖，他受到人民的敬爱。所有革命者都必须学习毛泽东著作。”
    一位农民说：“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，中国是人类的未来。”
    一位干部说：“毛泽东坚持并发展了真正的马克思列宁主义，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想代表世界无产阶级和革命人民的利益，因而能够鼓舞人民和领导人民前进。”
    一位大学生在赞扬毛泽东思想时说，毛泽东同志的著作“是马克思列宁主义的新发展。当前世界革命中发生的问题，只有在毛泽东同志的著作中才能找到答案”。
    匈牙利的一位老党员说：“毛泽东领导中国革命经过艰苦卓绝的斗争才取得今天的胜利，整个中国革命的历史都证明了毛泽东是一位伟大的领袖，他是多么正确！”
    一位文化工作者说：“我认为毛泽东思想不但在中国是正确的，在全世界也都是适用的。”
    一位退休工人激动地说：“毛泽东是第二个列宁。苏联修正主义攻击毛泽东同志领导中国人民搞世界革命，难道进行世界革命也有罪吗！”
    一位技术员说：“中国共产党是真正的马克思列宁主义的党，现在我们把希望都寄托在中国的身上了。”
    一位大学生说：“我正在学习毛泽东的著作，我认识到毛泽东思想是十分正确的革命学说。”
    波兰统一工人党的一位老党员说：“毛泽东同志是国际共产主义运动和全世界人民的伟大领袖和统帅。”他说：“我们这些老共产党人，一想到世界上有中国共产党，有毛泽东同志，就充满着希望，坚信共产主义必将冲破重重困难，最终在全世界取得完全的胜利。”
    一位波兰作曲家说：“毛泽东思想发展了列宁主义，他是划时代的人物。”
    一位波兰大学生说：“中国要建成共产主义，只能有一种思想——毛泽东思想。中国人考虑着世界上所有的穷人。”
    保加利亚到处都可以听到劳动人民表达他们对毛主席的热爱和敬仰。一位退休工人说，“毛泽东是当代的马克思和列宁，中国共产党是世界工人阶级的先锋队。”一位老共产党员骄傲地说，“我是毛泽东的党员，因为中国共产党是真正的马克思列宁主义的政党。”一位大学生说，“选择中国的道路，社会就向前发展，否则就要倒退。”
    有一次，当一些中国同志在一座山上游览时，一群保加利亚朋友马上朝他们跑来，同他们热烈地握手拥抱，他们热情地说：“我们热爱毛泽东、拥护毛泽东。”
