	Japan, apart from the monopolistic capitalists and militarist cliques that are pro-American, the broad masses of the people are our true friends. Friends have true and false, but through practice one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend.
	Mao Zedong

	Capital representatives from various circles gathered to support the appeal by prominent Japanese figures to promote Sino-Japanese friendship

	Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we will hold high the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship

	Liao Chengzhi said: Those who collude with the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Japanese reactionaries to oppose Sino-Japanese friendship are merely jumping jacks. Blackda Junnan, Kaneta Tomitaro, and Saionji Kichinosuke said: We must resolutely fight to the end against the forces that obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship.

	New China News Agency, October 5th: Over 1,500 representatives from various circles in the capital gathered this afternoon for a grand meeting to express their enthusiastic welcome and full support for the appeal by prominent figures from various circles in Japan on September 26th to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.

	The meeting declared that the Chinese people will unswervingly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, adhere to the policy of developing friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and together with the Japanese people, resolutely hold high the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship, create a thick atmosphere of Sino-Japanese friendship, and carry out the Sino-Japanese friendship movement in a solid and practical manner, making new contributions to the struggle of the peoples of the world against American imperialism and its lackeys.

	The meeting read out the statement by responsible persons from various circles and mass organizations in our country, expressing heartfelt support for the appeal by prominent figures from various circles in Japan to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. The statement pointed out that any attempts by American imperialism, the Japanese Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various old and new followers to sow discord, create divisions, harm, and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship will be jointly resisted and opposed by the peoples of China and Japan; the result of their conspiratorial activities will only be that they will lift a rock to drop on their own feet.

	Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, and other responsible persons from relevant circles attended the meeting.

	After Zhao Anbo, Secretary-General of the China-Japan Friendship Association, announced the start of the meeting, Liao Chengzhi, President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, delivered a speech. He warmly praised the statement issued by prominent Japanese figures, saying it was excellent and timely, greatly encouraging all those who wish to be friends with China and dealing a heavy blow to all forces hostile to Sino-Japanese friendship. Liao Chengzhi said, American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Japanese Sato government are extremely afraid of friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, fearing it to the core. They are constantly striving to obstruct Sino-Japanese exchanges and sabotage Sino-Japanese relations. However, the Sino-Japanese friendship movement has not been weakened or diminished by their obstruction and sabotage but has instead been strengthened and expanded. He pointed out that the Sino-Japanese friendship movement has achieved such great successes through arduous struggles, and the peoples of China and Japan cherish it dearly. Whoever obstructs it, we will not agree; whoever sabotages it, we will fight to the end!

	Liao Chengzhi said that recently, some people talk about Sino-Japanese friendship but in practice collude with American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries to strongly oppose Sino-Japanese friendship. These people have actually joined the ranks opposing Sino-Japanese friendship. There is nothing to be afraid of; they can only play the role of pitiful jumping jacks. In the face of the mighty current of Sino-Japanese friendship, they are like "ants shaking a tree." Their actions only expose their true colors to the peoples of China and Japan, placing themselves in a position opposed to the Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

	Liao Chengzhi said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "Apart from the monopolistic capitalists and militarist cliques that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." Chairman Mao also said, "Friends have true and false, but through practice one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend." Now, who is maintaining Sino-Japanese friendship and who is opposing it, the lines are becoming clearer. This is a necessary result of the deepening development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. This is a good thing, not a bad thing. It will be more conducive to the healthy development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

	He emphasized that the appearance of this countercurrent in the Sino-Japanese friendship movement is only a temporary phenomenon. There are many obstacles on the road to Sino-Japanese friendship, and various difficulties will inevitably arise in the future. However, the mainstream of the peoples of China and Japan seeking to develop friendship is unstoppable, and victory will definitely belong to the peoples of China and Japan!

	After Liao Chengzhi's speech, Kuroda Junnan, Vice-President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Kaneta Tomitaro, Vice-Chairman of the Japanese General Council, and Chairman of the Port Workers' Union, and Saionji Kichinosuke, a peace activist in Beijing, delivered speeches one after another.

	Kuroda Junnan said that the vast majority of the Japanese people oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and oppose Japan becoming a puppet of foreign military forces. They have made a firm vow: never to fight with China again. He pointed out that strengthening the unity of the peoples of China and Japan is not only in the interests of the peoples of the two countries but will also make an important contribution to supporting the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peace and liberation of Asia.

	Kuroda Junnan mentioned the emergence of a force in Japan that obstructs Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that we who truly and sincerely wish for Sino-Japanese exchanges and unity of the peoples of the two countries should, at this moment, resolutely rise up and fight against this obstructive force, smashing it to pieces.

	Kuroda Junnan emphasized that the unity movement of the peoples of China and Japan is a movement that conforms to the great historical trend and is a necessary historical movement. The obstruction of anyone will definitely fail, and our goal will definitely be achieved.

	Kaneta Tomitaro said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the successive cabinets of Japan have consistently obstructed the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. The struggle of the Japanese people to restore Sino-Japanese relations and the struggle for Japan's complete independence are one and the same. The current stage of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement is a sharp struggle against the Japanese and American reactionaries. He pointed out that in Japan, some people have degenerated to the point of following the modern revisionist line. They go against the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and have even stirred up a countercurrent. This shows that the situation of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and the struggle for Japan's complete independence is extremely complex and turbulent. He expressed his determination to carry out the Sino-Japanese friendship and the struggle for Japan's independence to the end and wished the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, even greater success.

	Saionji Kichinosuke said that American imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of China and Japan. Launching a joint struggle against this common enemy is the most important foundation of Sino-Japanese friendship. To achieve final victory in the struggle against American imperialism, we must recognize the true face of its accomplice, Soviet revisionism, and wage a resolute struggle against it. American imperialism and its followers, Soviet revisionism, and its lackeys, and some people who spout nonsense, actually serve the "anti-China holy alliance." All these people are our enemies. He pointed out that in this complex situation, it is extremely important to distinguish between friends and enemies, stand shoulder to shoulder with our own people, and dare to wage an uncompromising and merciless struggle against the enemy. There is no third way to avoid responsibility, and it is absolutely not allowed to stand in the position of a bystander who keeps a clear conscience.

	Saionji Kichinosuke said that recently, in Japan, some people have spouted strange theories. When we emphasize friendship, unity, and cooperation with the Chinese people, they label us as if we have lost our autonomy and independence and are national traitors. I want to respond to them as follows:

	First, every person in New China is a patriot. For this reason, the Chinese people are willing to make any sacrifice to support the anti-American national liberation struggles of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of other countries but do not pay any attention to those who have lost their independence and patriotism. The Chinese people support the Sino-Japanese friendship movement of the Japanese people because it is a patriotic and just movement of the Japanese people, a cause that conforms to the principle of equality and mutual benefit between the peoples of China and Japan, and an important task to drive American imperialism out of Asia and achieve true peace.

	Second, so-called autonomy is to act according to one's own judgment, to choose and unite with friends according to one's own judgment, to recognize enemies, and to wage struggles. We choose the Chinese people, who are firmly united around Chairman Mao Zedong with Mao Zedong Thought as their strong foundation, as our most reliable friends, and struggle for friendship, unity, and cooperation with them. This is the greatest extent to which we exercise our autonomy.

	Saionji Kichinosuke finally pointed out that friendship, unity, and cooperation with the Chinese people are the sincere wishes of the vast majority of the Japanese people. Whoever obstructs this is a traitor to the Japanese people, and we must resolutely struggle against them.

	Following this, in the midst of warm applause, Miyazaki Seiken, Vice-President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, read out the statement "Again Appeal to the Nation to Promote Sino-Japanese Friendship in the Face of Internal and External Crises" by 32 prominent figures from various circles in Japan. Kang Yonghe, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, read out the statement "Support the Appeal by Prominent Figures from Various Circles in Japan to Promote Sino-Japanese Friendship" by responsible persons from various circles and mass organizations in China.

	Over 400 Japanese friends currently visiting Beijing were invited to attend the meeting. Among them were: the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the delegation of the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee visiting China led by Sakamoto Tokumatsu and Kaji Shizuma, the delegation of the Japanese Women's Congress led by Tanaka Sumiko, the delegation of Japanese listeners to Beijing Radio led by Hamada Sei, the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet led by Shimizu Masao, the Japanese Zenshinza Theater led by Kawahara Shojiro, and Japanese experts and students studying in Beijing.

	Today's meeting was jointly organized by the China-Japan Friendship Association and seven other organizations.

专栏：

    日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。……朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。
    毛泽东
    首都各界集会支持日本知名人士呼吁促进日中友好运动的声明
    遵循毛主席的教导，高高举起中日友好的旗帜
    廖承志说：同美帝苏修和日本反动派狼狈为奸反对中日友好的人不过是跳梁小丑黑田寿男兼田富太郎西园寺公一等表示：要同阻挠日中友好的势力坚决斗争到底
    新华社五日讯　首都各界群众一千五百多人，今天下午隆重集会，对日本各界知名人士九月二十六日呼吁促进日中友好运动的声明，表示热烈欢迎和全面支持。
    大会表明，中国人民将坚定不移地遵循毛主席的教导，坚持发展中日两国人民友好的方针，同日本人民一道，决心把中日友好的旗帜举得高高的，把中日友好的空气搞得浓浓的，把中日友好运动开展得扎扎实实的，为世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争做出新的贡献。
    大会宣读了我国各界人士和各群众团体负责人的声明，衷心支持日本各界知名人士呼吁促进日中友好运动。声明指出，美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义和它的形形色色的新旧追随者的任何挑拨、离间、损害、破坏中日友好的阴谋活动，必将遭到中日两国人民的共同抵制和反对；他们进行阴谋活动的结果，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    郭沫若、刘宁一等有关方面负责人出席了大会。
    中日友协秘书长赵安博宣布大会开始后，中日友协会长廖承志发表讲话，热烈赞扬日本知名人士发表的声明好得很，发表得及时，它大大鼓舞了一切愿意同中国友好的人们，沉重地打击了一切敌视中日友好的势力。廖承志说，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本佐藤政府害怕中日两国人民友好，害怕得要命，他们无时无刻不在卖劲地阻挠中日友好往来，破坏中日友好关系。但是，中日友好运动并没有因为他们的阻挠、破坏而削弱、缩小，而是更加加强，更加扩大了。他指出，中日友好运动取得这样重大的成就，是经过艰苦斗争取得的，中日两国人民十分珍视它，谁要阻挠它，我们坚决不答应，谁要破坏它，我们就要跟它拚到底！
    廖承志说，最近，有些人口头上讲中日友好，但在行动上却同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本反动派狼狈为奸，一股劲地反对中日友好。这些人实际上参加了反对中日友好的行列。这没有什么了不起，他们只能充当一名可怜的跳梁小丑。在强大的中日友好的洪流面前，他们就像“蚂蚁撼大树”。他们这样做，恰恰在中日两国人民面前暴露了自己的真面目，把自己放在同中日友好运动相对立的地位。
    廖承志说，毛主席教导我们：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”毛主席又说，“朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。”现在，谁在维护中日友好，谁在反对中日友好，阵营是越来越明显了。这是中日友好运动深入发展的必然结果。这是好事，不是坏事。它将更有利于中日友好运动健康的发展。
    他强调说，中日友好运动出现这股逆流只不过是暂时的现象，在中日友好的道路上存在许多障碍，今后也还会出现这种或那种的困难，但是中日两国人民要求发展友好的主流，是永远也阻挡不了的，胜利一定属于中日两国人民！
    廖承志讲话以后，日中友好协会副会长黑田寿男、日本总评议会副议长、港湾工会委员长兼田富太郎、在京日本和平人士西园寺公一接着在大会上先后讲话。
    黑田寿男说，绝大多数日本人民反对复活日本军国主义，反对日本充当外国军事势力的傀儡，并且立下了坚定的誓言：决不再同中国打仗。他指出，加强日中两国人民的团结，不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且对于支持越南人民的反美斗争以及亚洲的和平与解放，必将做出重要的贡献。
    黑田寿男谈到在日本出现的一股阻挠日中友好的势力时说，我们真正地衷心愿望日中友好交流和两国人民团结的人，在这个时刻应当坚决奋起，同这股阻挠的势力进行斗争，并把它们打得粉碎。
    黑田寿男强调指出，日中两国的团结运动，是符合历史巨大潮流的运动，是历史必然的巨大运动，任何人的阻挠都必定失败，我们的目的一定能够获得成功。
    兼田富太郎说，自从中华人民共和国成立以来，日本的历届内阁一贯阻挠日中友好运动。日本人民为恢复日中邦交的斗争和争取日本完全独立的斗争是一回事。目前阶段的日中友好运动，就是同美日反动派进行尖锐较量的斗争。他指出，在日本有一些人已经堕落到执行现代修正主义路线。他们违背日中友好运动，甚至掀起了一股逆流。这说明，日中友好运动和为争取日本的完全独立的斗争，形势是极为复杂和动荡的。他表示决心把日中友好和争取日本独立的斗争进行到底，并祝在毛主席英明领导下的中国文化大革命获得更大的成功。
    西园寺公一说，美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人，向这个共同敌人展开共同的斗争，这就是日中友好的最重要的基础。为了在反对美帝国主义的斗争中取得最后的胜利，我们必须认清它的帮凶苏联修正主义的真面目，并与之进行坚决的斗争。美帝国主义及其追随者，苏联修正主义以及听从其指挥棒的走卒，还有些人发表胡言乱语，竟然和中国对抗，其结果是在为“反华神圣同盟”服务。所有这些人都是我们的敌人。他指出，在这种复杂的形势下，极为重要的是，认清敌我，紧紧地和自己人肩并肩，敢于同敌人进行毫不妥协的、无情的斗争。不可能存在回避责任的第三条道路，也绝不允许站在明哲保身的旁观者的立场。
    西园寺公一说，最近，在日本，有些人发表奇谈怪论。当我们强调同中国人民友好、团结和合作时，他们就把我们说成仿佛丧失了自主性和独立性的民族败类。我要这样回答他们：
    第一，每一个新中国的人民，都是爱国者。正因为这样，中国人民不惜付出多大的牺牲，支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，以及其他国家人民的爱国正义斗争，但绝不去理睬那些丧失独立性和爱国心的人们。中国人民所以支持日本人民的日中友好运动，是因为这是日本人民的爱国正义运动，是符合日中两国人民之间的平等互利的方针的事业，而且，这也是把美帝国主义赶出亚洲、实现真正和平的重要工作。
    第二，所谓自主性，就是根据自己的判断来采取行动，根据自己的判断来选择和团结朋友，认清敌人，开展斗争。我们选择以毛泽东思想为坚强基础，坚定地团结在毛泽东主席周围的中国人民作为我们最可靠的朋友，为同他们的友好、团结和合作而斗争，这就是最大限度地发挥了我们的自主性。
    西园寺公一最后指出，同中国人民的友好、团结和合作是绝大多数日本人民的衷心愿望，谁要加以阻挠，谁就是日本人民的叛徒，我们必须坚决和他们进行斗争。
    接着，在热烈的掌声中，日中友协理事长宫崎世民宣读了三十二位日本各界知名人士发表的《在内外危机的时候，再次呼吁国民促进日中友好》的声明。中华全国总工会副主任康永和宣读了中国各界人士和各群众团体负责人发表的《支持日本各界知名人士促进中日友好》的声明。
    正在北京访问的四百多名日本朋友应邀出席大会。他们当中有：日中友协代表团，由坂本德松和甲斐静马率领的日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团，由田中寿美子率领的日本妇女会议代表团，由滨田系卫率领的日本北京广播听众代表团，以清水正夫为首的日本松山芭蕾舞团，以河原崎长十郎为首的日本前进座剧团，以及在京的日本专家和留学生等。
  今天的大会是由中日友协等八个团体联合举办的。
