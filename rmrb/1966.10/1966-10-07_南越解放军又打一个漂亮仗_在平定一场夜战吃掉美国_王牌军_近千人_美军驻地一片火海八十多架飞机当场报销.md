The Liberation Army of South Vietnam has scored another brilliant victory. In a night battle in the province of Binh Dinh, they annihilated nearly a thousand American "elite" troops, turning the American military base into a sea of fire with over eighty aircraft destroyed.

According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the armed forces of Binh Dinh province launched fierce attacks on the American invaders and puppet troops on the nights of September 22 and 23, achieving significant victories. Preliminary reports indicate that the liberation forces killed or wounded nearly a thousand American troops from the 1st Cavalry Division, completely annihilated a puppet army battalion, and destroyed or damaged over eighty enemy aircraft and nearly one hundred and fifty military vehicles.

To conduct a large-scale "sweep" in the southern region of Vinh An district, Binh Dinh province, the American invaders concentrated most of the 1st Cavalry Division's forces, nearly ninety aircraft of various types, and more than one hundred and fifty military vehicles in the Na Mountain area, six kilometers northwest of Phu Quy town. On the night of September 22, the liberation forces of Binh Dinh province cleverly approached the American base and launched a sudden, fierce artillery barrage, turning the American base into a sea of fire. Following this, the liberation forces launched a multi-pronged assault on the American camp, airstrip, and parking lot. The soldiers bravely charged into the enemy lines, fighting fiercely and annihilating nearly a thousand American invaders. They destroyed or damaged over eighty aircraft and nearly one hundred and fifty military vehicles, and burned down an ammunition depot and many tents, once again routing the American "elite" troops.

On the night of September 23, the liberation forces of Binh Dinh province, riding on the momentum of victory, launched a fierce attack on the puppet troops of the 41st Regiment's 3rd Battalion, stationed fourteen kilometers north of Phu My town in My Loc commune, completely annihilating this enemy battalion.

The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam also published a commentary, enthusiastically hailing the recent victories of the liberation forces in Binh Dinh province, where they inflicted heavy losses on the American invaders and puppet troops.

The commentary said that this battle was fought brilliantly, with the infantry and artillery of the liberation forces coordinating closely. The liberation forces, with their bravery, cunning, and fierce firepower, quickly seized control of the battlefield, catching the enemy off guard. In just twelve minutes, the entire American forward base was completely paralyzed. Of the nearly ninety American aircraft, only three helicopters could take off, while the rest were burned or damaged along with hundreds of military vehicles.

The commentary pointed out that this great victory demonstrates the continuous development of the liberation forces' magical tactics.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on October 4, the Vietnam People's Army newspaper published a commentary on October 4, stating that the recent victories of the military and people of South Vietnam in Binh Dinh province, where they annihilated nearly a thousand American troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and a puppet army battalion, conclusively prove that the military and people of South Vietnam have the ability to annihilate the enemy at any place and time. Not only can they defeat the enemy conducting "sweeps," but they can also annihilate the enemy before it launches "sweeps."

The commentary pointed out that the military and people of the South have fully utilized the advantages of people's war, pushing the enemy into a strategically passive and desperate situation. The more they struggle, the less they find a way out.

    南越解放军又打一个漂亮仗
    在平定一场夜战吃掉美国“王牌军”近千人  美军驻地一片火海八十多架飞机当场报销
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方平定省解放武装力量，九月二十二日和二十三日两天夜晚接连猛烈袭击美国侵略军和伪军，取得重大胜利。据初步消息，解放武装力量共打死、打伤美国第一骑兵师侵略军近一千名，全歼伪军一个营，击毁、击伤敌机八十多架和军车近一百五十辆。
    美国侵略者为了对平定省怀恩县南部地区进行大规模“扫荡”，把第一骑兵师的大部兵力和近九十架各种类型飞机、一百五十多辆军车，集中在符吉县城西北六公里的没山地区。二十二日夜晚，平定省解放武装力量机智地接近美军驻地，突然进行猛烈炮击，把美军驻地打成一片火海。接着，解放武装力量又分多路猛攻美军营地、停机坪和停车场。战士们勇猛冲入敌阵，猛冲猛杀，一举消灭美国侵略军近千名，击毁、击伤敌机八十多架和军车近一百五十辆，并烧毁一座弹药库和许多帐篷，再一次把美国“王牌军”打得狼狈不堪。
    二十三日夜晚，平定省解放武装力量乘胜猛烈袭击驻扎在符美县城以北十四公里美禄乡的伪军第四十一团第三营，一举将这营敌军全部歼灭。
    越南南方解放电台还发表评论，热烈欢呼解放武装力量最近在平定省痛歼美国侵略军和伪军的大捷。
    评论说，这次战斗打得非常漂亮，解放武装力量的步兵和炮兵配合得非常紧密。解放武装力量以自己的勇敢、机智和猛烈的火力，迅速地控制了阵地，使敌人措手不及。仅在十二分钟内，美军的整个野战基地就被打得完全瘫痪。在美军的近九十架飞机中，只剩下了三架直升飞机可以起飞，其余的都和成百辆军车一起被烧毁或击伤。
    评论指出，这次大捷说明了解放武装力量的神奇战术的不断发展。
    据新华社河内四日电　越南《人民报》四日发表评论指出，越南南方军民最近在平定省一举歼灭美国第一骑兵师近千名和伪军一个营的大捷，雄辩地证明：越南南方军民有能力在任何地方和任何时候消灭敌人，不但可以打败进行“扫荡”的敌人，而且还可以在敌人准备发动“扫荡”的时候就消灭它。
    评论指出，南方军民发挥了人民战争的优势，使敌人深深陷入战略被动处境，越挣扎越找不到出路。
