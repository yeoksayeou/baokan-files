Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, who were unjustly ordered to suspend their studies and leave the country by the Soviet government, totaling 41 people, departed from Moscow by train on the 27th. Additionally, 24 Chinese students studying in Irkutsk, Soviet Union, will board the same train when it passes through that city, returning to their motherland.

More than 100 people, including Deputy Chief of Mission Zhang Deguan, Counselor An Zhiyuan, embassy staff, and representatives of the Chinese community, went to the station to give a warm send-off.

Embassy officials pinned a flower of honor on each Chinese student.

Students from many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, as well as some European countries studying in the Soviet Union, also came to the station to bid farewell enthusiastically. Some Soviet students also rushed to the station to say goodbye to the Chinese students. They shook hands and embraced the Chinese students, presented them with flowers, exchanged badges and gifts, and some even took photos with the Chinese students to commemorate the moment. Vietnamese students shed tears of emotion as they embraced the Chinese students. A Soviet young woman, upon hearing the Chinese students singing "The Internationale," exclaimed, "Chinese people! You are great!"

At the station, the Chinese students held high the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," wore Mao badges and flowers of honor on their chests, and together with those who came to see them off, sang "The East is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "The Internationale" in unison.

Before the Chinese students left Moscow, all staff of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union held a grand farewell banquet for the Chinese students on the evening of the 26th.

Deputy Chief of Mission Zhang Deguan strongly condemned the Soviet authorities' despicable actions of intensifying anti-China activities and worsening Sino-Soviet relations. He extended his warmest and most sincere greetings to the Chinese students who were unjustly expelled by the Soviet authorities. In his speech, he quoted Chairman Mao's words: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing."

Zhang Deguan emphasized that Chinese revolutionary youth, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless. He encouraged the Chinese students to study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, faithfully implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Chinese student representative Sun Manling said at the meeting: "We will firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and stand firm in our struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. No matter what storms and waves we may encounter on the road of struggle, we will definitely walk this revolutionary path." In his speech, he quoted Chairman Mao's words: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are grown in the midst of the people's struggles, tempered in the great winds and storms of revolution." He said that in the future, they will continue to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the great storms and waves of class struggle.

The atmosphere at the banquet was enthusiastic, with continuous shouts of "Oppose imperialism, oppose revisionism!" "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry the struggle against revisionism to the end!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!"

After the banquet, everyone watched the documentary film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" and held a tea party and get-together.

    欢送会上，大家都情绪激昂，不断高呼：“反帝必须反修！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决把反对修正主义的斗争进行到底！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！”
