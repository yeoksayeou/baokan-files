In the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, once again received 1.5 million Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, and reviewed the magnificent army of the cultural revolution composed of them.

From August 18 to today, in just two months, Chairman Mao has received the Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country and the capital four times. Today, the young revolutionaries said with great excitement that Chairman Mao understands us the most, cares for us the most, and supports us the most. Chairman Mao's four receptions of us during the Cultural Revolution are the greatest encouragement to us revolutionary youth and the broad revolutionary masses. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defend and carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and fight to the end for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, the sky over the capital was clear and blue, and the sun shone brightly over the entire city. When the sun rose from the eastern horizon, casting a thousand rays of light, the Red Guards and revolutionary students, full of vigor, held high red flags and portraits of Chairman Mao, converging from all directions to Tiananmen Square and the wide avenues connected to it. The young revolutionaries wore red "Red Guards" armbands, each holding a shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," forming a magnificent red tide stretching for fifty li. They faced the rising red sun, reading aloud the quotations from Chairman Mao and singing "The East is Red" and "The Ship of the Great Sea." They also sang enthusiastically: "Raise the red flag, beat the war drum, with loyal hearts to make revolution, the morning sun shines with ten thousand rays, we are the Red Guards of Chairman Mao!"

At 12:50 PM, the solemn melody of "The East is Red" began to play, and the most happy moment that everyone had been looking forward to day and night arrived!

Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Kang Sheng, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yun, Dong Biwu, Chen Yi, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Li Xuefeng, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, Wang Renzhong, Liu Zhijian, Zhang Chunqiao, and others, rode in nine open-top cars and came among the vast Red Guards and revolutionary students. At this moment, Tiananmen Square and the wide avenues were filled with an unprecedented surge of joy. Countless arms waved the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and countless eyes looked towards the reddest sun in their hearts. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, was radiant and full of vigor, standing on the first open-top car. For more than an hour, Chairman Mao rode through the 1.5 million cultural revolutionaries who lined the streets, waving and greeting the Red Guards and revolutionary students continuously.

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, full of spirit, stood on the second open-top car, reviewing the cultural revolution army together with Chairman Mao.

"Chairman Mao is coming!" "Chairman Mao is coming!" Throughout the review of the cultural revolution army, wherever Chairman Mao's open-top car passed, there was a surge of joy, and the shouts and songs were like a roaring sea, reaching a peak of joy.

Fifteen revolutionary young people from Dalian Maritime Academy, who walked more than two thousand li from Dalian, saw their beloved leader Chairman Mao today. They were full of passion and shouted loudly towards Chairman Mao, expressing the boundless love of hundreds of millions of revolutionary youth across the country for Chairman Mao. These revolutionary young people inherited and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the Long March of the Red Army, forming a "Long March Red Guard Team." With indomitable will, they crossed mountains and rivers, overcame countless difficulties, and walked to Beijing, the place they had longed for day and night, in just one month. To express their love for Chairman Mao, they decided to present the "Long March Red Guard Team" banner they had sewn with their own hands, which had been through wind and rain and recorded their battle journey, to Chairman Mao. They also wrote a pledge titled "Long Live Chairman Mao," expressing their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and advance bravely in the stormy seas, fighting the revolution to the end on the long march of revolution.

From the coast of the South China Sea to the north of the Tianshan Mountains, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Red Guards and revolutionary students from various ethnic groups who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" thousands of times today when they accepted the review of the great commander Chairman Mao. Red Guards from cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, and Shenyang, after being reviewed by Chairman Mao, took an oath on the spot: "Dear Chairman Mao, please rest assured. We will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We will learn in the struggle and truly focus on the 'use' of Chairman Mao's works. We will defend the proletarian revolutionary line you represent and be your good soldiers and students. Anyone who opposes you and this proletarian revolutionary line, we will thoroughly overthrow them!"

Chairman Mao's open-top car passed in front of the revolutionary young people from the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi. The young people clearly saw their most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and they shouted excitedly, "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" They said: "Chairman Mao is very healthy, which is our greatest happiness and the greatest guarantee for the victory of the Chinese and world revolution! The first revolutionary story we heard as children was the story of Chairman Mao saving the Chinese revolution at the Zunyi Conference. Our first classroom for learning revolutionary traditions is the site of the Zunyi Conference. We deeply understand that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the lifeline of the Chinese people, and doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought! We said: We have come to Chairman Mao's side in the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seen our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and been greatly encouraged. We will inherit the revolutionary traditions of the Zunyi Conference, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and be the vanguard in thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, letting the light of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao shine forever!"

Red Guards and revolutionary students from the revolutionary cradle of Jiangxi Pinggangshan region came to Beijing, bringing a red banner embroidered by their classmates day and night, to present to the great leader Chairman Mao. The banner was embroidered with eighteen golden characters: "Wishing our most, most, most beloved leader Chairman Mao a long life." Today, when Chairman Mao rode towards Tiananmen Square, these revolutionary young people shouted and sang enthusiastically: "The party's favor is greater than the sky and the earth, parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao." They also brought a pair of new straw shoes they had woven themselves, wrapped in a red paper box, prepared to present to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to learn the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, follow Chairman Mao to revolution for life, and never change their hearts.

Revolutionary young people from Yan'an University, on behalf of the poor peasants and revolutionary cadres of Yan'an, brought corn from Yangjialing and corn grown on the land where Chairman Mao had worked, to Beijing to present to Chairman Mao. Today, Chairman Mao came to see them, and they could not suppress their boundless passion. They wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, saying: "We are the youth of Yan'an, we love Chairman Mao the most, we admire and respect the great Mao Zedong Thought the most, we love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and we love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We dare to make revolution, we dare to rebel, we will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!"

Chairman Mao stood majestically on the open-top car, occasionally looking at the joyful crowds on both sides of the avenue, waving his arms, and greeting the Red Guards and revolutionary students. The crowd's cheers rose higher and higher.

After Chairman Mao's open-top car passed in front of the revolutionary students from Kashgar Normal School and Xinjiang Postal School, many students quickly opened their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wrote the same words on the cover page: "At 1:10 PM on October 18, this is the happiest and most unforgettable moment of my life, I saw the eternal red sun Chairman Mao." Some students, seeing Chairman Mao, shed tears of happiness and wrote down their excited poems on the spot: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I cannot express my gratitude to you in a thousand words! If it were not for you leading us to make revolution, how could a herder's daughter come to Beijing. On this unforgettable day, I solemnly pledge to you: The sea may dry up, the stones may rot, but my heart to follow you in revolution will never change."

Three hundred and eighty-three minority revolutionary students from Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan saw the great leader Chairman Mao waving to them in his military uniform, and many of them were moved to tears. A Yi student from a slave family said: "My ancestors were all slaves. My parents were killed by the slave owners when I was one year old. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are my parents." He clenched his fist and swore: "I love to read Chairman Mao's books the most. This time, seeing Chairman Mao, has given me boundless strength. I will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works well. I will definitely be fearless, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!"

More than thirty thousand revolutionary students from the military academies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army accepted the review of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao with boundless happiness and great excitement. At 1:20 PM, when Chairman Mao's open-top car passed in front of the queue of a certain military medical academy, amidst the endless cheers, a Red Guard took out a camera and captured this unforgettable moment. Comrades wrote down a poem titled "The Happiest 'Ten Bests'" for this photo on the spot: "Write down the happiest moment, take the happiest photo, record the most unforgettable place, hold up the reddest quotations, shout the loudest slogans, sing the most heartfelt songs, exchange the happiest thoughts, make the most revolutionary resolutions, wish the most beloved leader Chairman Mao a long life."

Many comrades from military academies hurriedly bought a new "East is Red" diary after coming to Beijing, wanting to start writing their red diaries from the day they saw Chairman Mao. A son of a revolutionary martyr wrote after seeing Chairman Mao: "The red flags dance in the eastern wind, the five mountains shout for Mao Zedong, the four volumes of great works are in my hands, the highest instructions are in my heart. The soul is in revolution, the hard skills are practiced, the hot blood is shed for the people, and the leader Mao Zedong is defended." Some comrades wrote: "Chairman Mao, in this great storm of class struggle, your body is so healthy, you stand at the forefront of the revolutionary ship, pointing the direction of victory, inspiring us to move forward forever!"

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, ended their warm meeting with everyone. On Tiananmen Square and the fifty-li-wide avenue, the vast Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country could not suppress their excitement and did not want to leave for a long time. They gathered in groups, talking about their happy feelings after seeing Chairman Mao. Everyone's thousand words and ten thousand words converged into a common wish: We must take Chairman Mao's boundless concern and great encouragement to the whole country, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new high tide!

    从八月十八日到今天的短短两个月中，毛主席先后四次专门接见了来自全国各地和首都的红卫兵和革命师生。今天，革命小将们怀着无比激动的心情说，毛主席最了解我们，最关心我们，最支持我们。毛主席在文化大革命中四次接见我们，是对我们革命青少年和广大革命群众的最大鼓舞。他们表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决捍卫和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    今天，首都碧空万里，灿烂的阳光普照全城。当太阳从东方地平线上喷出万道霞光的时候，英姿焕发的红卫兵和革命师生们，高举红旗和毛主席像，从四面八方汇集到天安门广场，汇集到和广场相连结的宽广大道上。小将们佩戴着红色的“红卫兵”袖章，人人手持闪着红光的《毛主席语录》，整个队伍绵延达五十华里，结成了一条极其壮观的红色巨流。小将们迎着冉冉升起的红太阳，一遍一遍地朗读毛主席语录，高歌《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》。他们还纵情地唱道：“举红旗，擂战鼓，赤胆忠心闹革命，早晨的太阳光芒万丈，我们是毛主席的红卫兵！”
    中午十二点五十分，庄严的《东方红》乐曲声响起来了，人们日夜盼望的最幸福的时刻来到了！
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他负责同志周恩来、陶铸、陈伯达、邓小平、康生、刘少奇、朱德、李富春、陈云、董必武、陈毅、贺龙、李先念、谭震林、徐向前、聂荣臻、叶剑英、李雪峰、谢富治、刘宁一、萧华、杨成武、江青、王任重、刘志坚、张春桥等，分乘九辆敞篷汽车，来到了广大红卫兵和革命师生中间。这时，天安门广场和宽广的大道上，激起无比欢腾的声浪。千万双手臂挥舞红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，千万双眼睛迎向心中最红最红的红太阳。“毛主席万岁”、“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声，震响云霄。
    毛主席身穿草绿色军装，红光满面，神采奕奕，一直站在第一辆敞篷车上。在一个多小时中，毛主席乘车从夹道欢呼的一百五十万文化革命大军中驰过，不停地向红卫兵和革命师生们招手致意。
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，精神焕发，站在第二辆敞篷汽车上，同毛主席一起检阅了文化革命大军。
    “毛主席来啦！”“毛主席来啦！”在检阅文化革命大军的整个过程中，毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车驶到哪里，哪里就一片欢腾，口号声和歌声像山呼海啸，出现了欢乐的高潮。
    从大连步行二千多里来到北京的大连海运学院十五名革命小将，当他们今天见到敬爱的领袖毛主席的时候，热情奔放，向着毛主席不停地放声欢呼，表达了全国亿万革命青少年无限热爱毛主席的心情。这些革命小将们继承和发扬红军长征的革命精神，组成了一支“长征红卫队”，以顽强的毅力，跋山涉水，战胜重重困难，用一个月时间走到了他们日夜向往的北京。他们为了表达对毛主席的热爱，决定把他们自己亲手缝制的，经过风吹雨打，纪录了他们战斗历程的“长征红卫队”大旗，献给毛主席。他们还以“毛主席万岁”为题写了一份决心书，表示一定要遵照毛主席的教导，在大风大浪中奋勇前进，在革命的长征路上跟着毛主席革命到底。
    从南海之滨到天山南北，从黑龙江畔到康藏高原，来京进行革命大串连的各民族红卫兵和革命师生，今天在接受伟大统帅毛主席检阅的时刻，千百次地振臂欢呼“毛主席万岁！”上海、天津、广州、成都、西安、沈阳等城市的许多红卫兵小将，在毛主席检阅以后，当场立下了誓言：敬爱的毛主席，请你老人家放心，我们坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，在斗争中学，真正在“用”字上狠下功夫，捍卫你所代表的无产阶级革命路线，做你的好战士、好学生。谁要反对你，谁要反对这条无产阶级革命路线，我们就把他彻底打倒！
    毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车驶过了来自革命历史名城遵义的革命小将队列前面。小将们清楚地看到了最敬爱的领袖毛主席，兴奋得连声欢呼毛主席万寿无疆。他们说：毛主席非常健康，是我们最大的幸福，是中国和世界革命胜利的最大保证！遵义的革命小将们从小听到的第一个革命故事，就是毛主席在遵义会议上挽救了中国革命的故事。他们学习革命传统的第一个课堂，就是遵义会议会址。他们深深懂得：毛主席代表的无产阶级革命路线是中国人民的命根子，干革命全靠毛泽东思想！他们说：我们在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中来到了毛主席身边，见到了最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，受到了极大的鼓舞。我们要继承遵义会议的革命传统，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓当彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的急先锋，让毛主席代表的无产阶级革命路线的光芒永照万代！
    从中国革命摇篮江西井冈山地区来到北京的红卫兵和革命师生们，带来了在校同学日夜赶绣的一面红色锦旗，献给伟大领袖毛主席。锦旗上绣着十八个金字：“祝我们最最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆”。今天，当毛主席乘车驰向天安门广场时，这些革命小将尽情地欢呼歌唱：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”他们还带来了亲手织的一双新草鞋，用红纸盒装起来，准备献给毛主席，表示自己要努力学习工农红军艰苦奋斗的革命精神，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，永远永远不变心。
    来自革命圣地的延安大学革命小将们，受延安贫下中农和革命干部的委托，把杨家岭出产的小米和毛主席曾经劳动过的一块土地上长的玉米，带来北京转送给毛主席。今天，毛主席来看大家了，他们怎么也抑制不住内心的无限激情，大家给毛主席写了一封信。信中写道：“我们是延安的青年，我们最最热爱毛主席，最最崇拜、敬仰伟大的毛泽东思想，我们最爱读毛主席的书，最爱听毛主席的话。我们敢革命，敢造反，我们坚决遵循毛主席的教导，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    毛主席雄伟地屹立在敞篷汽车上，不时环顾两旁大道上欢腾的队伍，挥动手臂，向着红卫兵小将和革命师生致意。人群中，欢呼声一浪高过一浪。
    当毛主席乘着敞篷汽车从新疆喀什师专和新疆邮电学校革命师生的队伍面前驰过以后，许多学生赶紧打开《毛主席语录》，在扉页上写下了同样的语言：“十月十八日下午一点十分，是我一生中最最幸福、最最难忘的时刻，我见到了永远不落的红太阳毛主席。”有的学生见到了毛主席，含着幸福的热泪，当场写下了激动的诗句：“毛主席啊毛主席，我对你感激之情千言万语说不尽！不是你老人家领导我们干革命，一个牧民的女儿那能上北京。在难忘的今天，我向你庄严宣誓：海可枯，石可烂，永远跟你干革命的心不变。”
    四川凉山彝族自治州的三百八十三名少数民族革命师生代表，看到伟大的领袖毛主席身穿军装向他们招手的时候，许多人都激动得热泪盈眶。一个出身于奴隶家庭的彝族学生说：“我家祖祖辈辈是奴隶。我的父母在我一岁那年就被奴隶主杀死。毛主席和共产党就是我的亲爹娘。”他握紧拳头发誓说：“我最爱读毛主席的书。这次见到了毛主席，更给我增添了无穷的力量。我一定响应林彪同志的号召，好好学习毛主席著作。我一定要天不怕，地不怕，坚决听毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    三万多名来自中国人民解放军军事院校的革命师生，怀着无限幸福、无比激动的心情，接受了毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的检阅。下午一点二十分，毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车在某军事医学院的队伍前面通过时，在经久不息的欢呼声中，一位红卫兵拿起照相机拍下了这个难忘的镜头。同志们当场你一句我一句，为这幅照片写下了题为《最幸福的“十最”》的题照诗：“写下最幸福的时刻，拍下最幸福的照片，记下最难忘的地点，举起最鲜红的语录，喊出最响亮的口号，唱出最衷情的歌声，交流最幸福的感想，定下最革命的决心，祝愿最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆。”
    军事院校的不少同志来京后急忙买了一册崭新的“东方红”日记本，要从见到毛主席的这一天开始写自己的红色日记。一位革命烈士的儿子见到毛主席以后写道：“四海红旗舞东风，五岳欢呼毛泽东，雄文四卷捧在手，最高指示印心中。灵魂深处闹革命，苦练杀敌过硬功。洒尽热血为人民，保卫领袖毛泽东。”有的同志写道：“毛主席啊，在这阶级斗争的大风大浪里，你的身体是多么健康，你站在革命航船的前头，指引着胜利的方向，激励着我们永远向前！”
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志以及中央其他负责同志，同大家的亲切会见结束了，在天安门广场上，在五十华里的宽阔大道上，来自全国各地的广大红卫兵和革命师生无法抑制内心的激动，久久不愿离开。他们一群群地围拢在一起，交谈着见到毛主席以后的幸福心情。人们千言万语，汇成一个共同的心愿：我们一定要把毛主席的无限关怀和巨大鼓舞带到全国去，把无产阶级文化大革命推向新的高潮！（附图片）
