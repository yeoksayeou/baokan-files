Chairman Mao teaches us to be responsible for the people's interests. To mark defects on the cloth one has woven is to draw a revolutionary red circle in one's mind.

Marking defects on the cloth one has woven is an advanced experience we learned from a sister mill. When this method was first proposed, I thought it would be beneficial for improving product quality and actively responded to it. However, after marking defects for a few days, I found that I had two or three pieces of substandard cloth each day, exceeding the standard by one or two times, and falling behind the apprentices. I began to waver. Should I stop or continue marking defects? This sparked a fierce struggle in my mind. At this time, I re-studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and other articles. Chairman Mao said: "Our army is a people's army. It fights for the people's interests and liberates the people." I thought, if I stop marking defects and let them pass, this does not align with Chairman Mao's teachings and is not a responsible attitude towards the people's interests. Continuing to mark defects is to persist in the revolution. Chairman Mao's words gave me the determination and strength to carry out self-revolution. I used to think that covering up defects was deceiving the inspectors. Upon reflection, it is not just deceiving the inspectors but also deceiving my country, my party, and my people. Thinking of this, I became more determined: I must continue marking defects and, with the attitude of a master, weave good cloth for the people.

In the process of implementing this method, I also heard some cold remarks. Things like "it affects bonuses" and "what's in it for me," and so on. I think: if one is reluctant to give up bonuses that should not be taken, it means one is unwilling to break with bourgeois ideology. I would rather take less or no bonuses, but I will revolutionize. When we do something, we should not first consider what's in it for us. We should first consider what's good for the party, the revolution, the people, and the country. I think this method of marking defects has many advantages. First, doing so is responsible to the party and the people, achieving genuine results, not false ones; second, it can expose production problems, making it easier to take measures to solve them; third, it can create favorable conditions for the next process, reducing missed inspections.

Through marking defects, I received a profound education on for whom we labor. I realized that this is not just about drawing a few circles on the cloth. More importantly, it is about truly drawing a red circle of serving the people and revolutionizing in one's mind.

    毛主席教导我们，要对人民的利益负责。在自己织的布上画出疵点，就是在思想上——
    画上革命的红圈
    金州纺织厂工人　魏兴成
    在自己织的布上画出疵点，这是我们厂向兄弟厂学来的一项先进经验。
    开始提出这个办法的时候，我觉得这样做对提高产品质量有好处，积极带头响应。可是，画了几天，每天都出两、三匹次布，超过指标一两倍，落在徒工的后面了。我就有点动摇。是停下来，还是坚持画下去？在我思想上引起了激烈的斗争。这时，我又重新学习了《为人民服务》、《将革命进行到底》等文章。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我想，停下来不画，把疵点放过去，这样做不符合毛主席的教导，不是对人民的利益负责的态度。坚持画下去就是坚持革命。毛主席的话给了我进行自我革命的决心和力量。我过去总以为掩盖疵点是糊弄验布工。仔细一想，糊弄的不是验布工，而是自己的国家，自己的党，自己的人民。想到这里，我更加坚定了决心：一定要继续画下去，要以主人翁的劳动态度，为人民织好布。
    在实行这个办法的过程中，也听到一些冷言冷语。什么“影响得奖”啦，“对自己有什么好处”啦，等等。我认为：舍不得那些不应该拿的奖金，就是不愿意和资产阶级思想决裂。我宁肯少拿或不拿奖金，也要革命。我们做一件事，不能首先考虑对自己有什么好处，应该首先考虑对党、对革命、对人民、对国家有什么好处。我觉得这种画圈的办法好处很多，第一，这样做是对党对人民负责，是真成绩，不是假成绩；第二，可以暴露生产上的矛盾，便于采取措施解决；第三，可以为下道工序创造有利条件，减少漏验。
    通过画圈，我受到了一次深刻的为谁劳动的教育，懂得了这不仅是在布面上画几个圈的问题，更重要的是，要在思想上真正画上为人民服务的红圈、革命的红圈。
