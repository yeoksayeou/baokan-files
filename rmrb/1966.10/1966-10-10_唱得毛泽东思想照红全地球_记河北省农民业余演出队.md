The sky is blue, the sea is deep,
Mao Zedong loves the people the most,
He works for the people's happiness,
He cares for the people's every need,
Mao Zedong is our poor and lower-middle peasants' dear friend.

The sun is red, the sun is bright,
The sun is Mao Zedong,
It illuminates our hearts so bright,
It stirs the waves across the seas,
It rouses the drums on all continents,
Billions of people sing in unison:
Dear Mao Zedong,
You are the red sun in our hearts!

During the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, an amateur performance troupe composed of several dozen poor and lower-middle peasants from nine prefectures and over forty production brigades in Hebei Province, sang praises and, with the demeanor of the main force of the Cultural Revolution, ascended the stage of the capital's arts. Their performance of the song and dance show "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Love Mao Zedong the Most" was enthusiastically received by workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Red Guards gathered in the capital praised their performance with fiery language: "The stage is full of new proletarian winds, full of images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, full of Mao Zedong Thought!" Students from Peking University wrote in a letter to them: "Your successful performance is a resounding blow to the bourgeois reactionary 'authorities' in the arts world, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!"

The Hebei Province Farmers' Amateur Performance Troupe was born and grew in the midst of sharp class struggle.

A few years ago, when our country's economic construction encountered temporary difficulties, some ghosts and snakes emerged, using the pretext of guiding rural club activities to stage dramas and dances full of capitalist, revisionist, and feudal poison. The poor and lower-middle peasants living in Hebei's rural areas, with their glorious revolutionary struggle history, saw these messy programs and felt very indignant. They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and decided to wage an uncompromising struggle against these ghosts and snakes.

The well-known Red Flag Militia Camp of Guozhuang, under the leadership of the party branch, took the lead in counterattacking in the summer of 1964, picking up the pen to create works that reflected the fiery struggle of life and inspired people's fighting spirit, such as "Grip the Gun in Hand" and "Militia Spirit High." These performances were immediately warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Other rural areas in Hebei Province also saw poor and lower-middle peasants "raise the hoe to open the sky and pick up the pen to write articles," engaging in mass amateur literary and artistic creation and performance activities, producing a batch of revolutionary literary and artistic works, and training a cadre team for amateur literary and artistic activities.

The current Hebei Farmers' Amateur Performance Troupe was formed in the spring of 1965 based on the Hebei Province Amateur Art Festival. Since then, they have gathered three times and performed throughout most of Hebei Province. They perform while guiding, spreading the seeds of socialist culture everywhere, inspiring people's fighting spirit, and continuously expanding and occupying the socialist cultural front in rural areas.

This new type of farmers' amateur performance troupe not only fights against ghosts and snakes in rural areas but also bravely ascends the stage of arts in an uncompromising struggle against the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought artistic line led by Zhou Yang.

In March 1965, when the farmers' amateur performance troupe was organized for the first time to tour rural areas, Zhou Yang, as the deputy head of the Propaganda Department, happened to be in Tianjin. The comrades enthusiastically organized a special performance for him, hoping to gain his support. However, Zhou Yang, this head of the black line in the arts, did not clap even once after watching the performance and adopted a non-acknowledgment attitude. This spring, when the amateur performance troupe was organized for the second time to tour rural areas and passed through Beijing, someone suggested that they perform in Beijing, but they were suppressed by a small clique of anti-party, anti-socialist rightists in the Beijing municipal cultural department. The comrades of the amateur performance troupe were very angry and said, "If you don't approve, let the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and working people approve! If Beijing has no stage for us, we will go to the vast stages of the countryside. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, want to be revolutionary hard bones, like Lu Xun, 'frowning at a thousand pointing fingers,' and not beg you people!"

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is like a spring thunder, breaking the monopoly of the stage by a small clique of bourgeois "artists"! In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Hebei Province Farmers' Amateur Performance Troupe was organized for the third time and received a notice from the Ministry of Culture to come to Beijing to participate in the National Day performance. The news spread, and the comrades were all excited and proud, shouting in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" Especially on the eve of National Day, Premier Zhou Enlai watched their performance and went on stage to shake hands with each of them, representing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to warmly greet them. The comrades could not help but shed tears of joy, saying: Today, the stage is set by the Party for us, and Chairman Mao personally directs us to ascend. Our wish to perform by Chairman Mao's side has been realized! We will sing and dance freely on this stage, by Chairman Mao's side, for thousands of years, singing until the red flags fly everywhere, singing until Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire globe!

This beloved performance troupe is also an excellent propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. They go wherever they perform, and they propagate wherever they go. The masses affectionately call them the "Eighth Route Army Propaganda Team."

    唱得毛泽东思想照红全地球
    ——记河北省农民业余演出队
    “蓝天高，大海深，毛主席最最爱人民，处处为人民谋幸福，事事为人民来操心，毛主席是咱贫下中农的知心人。……”
    “太阳红，太阳亮，太阳就是毛主席，照得我们心儿亮堂堂，照得四海浪涛翻，照得五洲战鼓响，亿万人民齐欢唱：敬爱的毛主席，你是我们心中的红太阳！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，由河北省九个专区、四十多个生产大队的几十名贫下中农社员组成的业余演出队，高唱赞歌，以文化大革命主力军的英姿登上了首都文艺舞台。他们演出的《贫下中农最爱毛主席》歌舞专场，受到工农兵空前热烈的欢迎。云集在首都的红卫兵用火一般的语言赞美他们的演出是：“满台无产阶级新风，满台工农兵形象，满台毛泽东思想！”北京大学的同学在给他们的信中写道：“你们成功的演出，是对艺术界的资产阶级反动‘权威’的迎头痛击，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！”
    河北省农民业余演出队是在尖锐的阶级斗争中诞生和成长起来的。
    几年前，当我国经济建设遭到暂时困难的时候，社会上一些牛鬼蛇神破门而出，借口辅导农村俱乐部活动，大排充满资本主义、修正主义和封建主义毒素的戏剧和歌舞。生活在有着光荣革命斗争历史的河北农村的贫下中农，看到这些乌七八糟的节目，感到十分愤慨，他们记起毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，决心同那些牛鬼蛇神进行不调和的斗争。
    为大家所熟知的郭庄红旗民兵营，在党支部的领导下，在一九六四年夏天，首先奋起反击，挥笔创作，先后登台演出了《紧握手中枪》、《民兵志气高》等反映火热斗争生活、激励人们斗志的节目，立即受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。河北省农村的其他一些地区也出现了贫下中农“举起镢头开天地，拿起笔杆写文章”的群众性业余文艺创作、演出活动，涌现出一批革命文艺作品，锻炼了一支业余文艺活动骨干队伍。
    现在的这个河北农民业余演出队，就是一九六五年春天在河北省业余文艺会演的基础上，抽调部分演出骨干组成的。从那时到现在，先后集中过三次，演出遍及河北省的大部。他们一边演出，一边辅导，到处散播社会主义文化的种子，鼓舞人们的斗志，从而不断扩大和占领农村的社会主义文化阵地。
    这支新型的农民业余演出队，不仅在农村中同牛鬼蛇神斗，而且也是在同以周扬为首的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺路线进行不调和的斗争中，英勇地登上文艺舞台的。
    一九六五年三月，农民业余演出队第一次组织起来到农村巡回演出时，正逢周扬以中宣部副部长的身份去到天津，同志们热忱地为他组织了一次专场演出，希望得到他的支持。但是，周扬这个文艺黑线头子看了这场演出，连一次掌也没有鼓过，采取了不承认态度。今年春天，业余演出队第二次组织起来在农村巡回演出路过北京时，曾有人提出要他们在北京演出，结果又遭到当时北京市文化部门一小撮反党反社会主义右派分子的压制。业余演出队的同志们非常气愤，他们说，你不批准，让广大贫下中农、劳动人民来批准！北京没有我们的舞台，我们就到农村的广大舞台去，咱贫下中农要当革命的硬骨头，像鲁迅那样“横眉冷对千夫指”，不向你们这些人求告！
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命好似春雷一声，打破了一小撮资产阶级“文艺家”垄断舞台的局面！在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，河北省农民业余演出队第三次组织起来，并且接到文化部的通知，要他们到北京参加国庆演出。消息传来，同志们无不感到欢欣鼓舞，扬眉吐气，同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”特别在国庆节前夕，周恩来总理观看了他们的演出，并且上台一一和他们握手，代表党中央和毛主席亲切地向他们问好时，同志们禁不住热泪盈眶地说：今天的舞台党给咱们搭，毛主席亲自指挥我们登，我们渴望在毛主席身边演出的心愿实现了！我们要在这个舞台上，在毛主席身边放声歌唱，纵情舞蹈，要千年万代唱下去，唱得红旗满天飘，唱得毛泽东思想照红全地球！”
    这支受人爱戴的演出队，也是一支出色的毛泽东思想宣传队，他们走到哪里，宣传到哪里。群众亲切地称他们为“八路军宣传队”。
