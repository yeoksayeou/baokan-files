The Soviet revisionist leaders recently engaged in a dirty counter-revolutionary political deal with Malik, the foreign minister of the Indonesian fascist regime whose hands are stained with blood. Malik visited the Soviet Union from October 17 to 22, shortly after his trip to the United States.

Prior to Malik's much-anticipated visit, officials from the Soviet Union and Indonesia, along with their propaganda machines, repeatedly praised each other, expressing their desire for "unity and cooperation." In early September, the Soviet revisionist leadership openly and unreasonably expelled Anwar Darma, the correspondent of the Indonesian Communist Party's organ, *Harian Rakyat*, from Moscow as a friendly gesture to welcome Malik. Shortly after, Soviet Ambassador to Indonesia, Sekanov, met with the right-wing military leader of Indonesia, Suharto, in mid-September, praising this reactionary regime, which had openly aligned itself with U.S. imperialism, for "continuing to pursue its anti-imperialist and anti-colonial policies." He stated that the "Soviet government's attitude towards the Indonesian government remains unchanged."

Malik received a grand welcome in the Soviet Union and held separate talks with Soviet Premier Kosygin, Foreign Minister Gromyko, and the Chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, Skachkov.

During Malik's visit, the Soviet leaders openly provided him with a platform to slander China and communism. According to reports from the Antara News Agency, Malik delivered a lengthy speech at a welcome banquet hosted by Skachkov on October 18, falsely accusing China of interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs and viciously attacking and slandering the Indonesian Communist Party. He justified the bloody crimes committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in suppressing the Communist Party and the people. At the same time, Malik stated that the suppression of the Indonesian Communist Party by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces was an "internal affair of Indonesia," and he hoped that this action would "not hinder or affect the existing friendly relations between Indonesia and the Soviet Union." He also said that the right-wing military regime led by Suharto in Indonesia "eagerly desires to maintain friendly relations and cooperation with the Soviet Union."

Although the Soviet propaganda machine strictly kept the content and results of the talks secret, Western news agencies reported that before leaving Moscow on October 22, Malik said with satisfaction that his visit was "very satisfactory for Indonesia," and his talks with Kosygin, Gromyko, and others had "brought about understanding and closer relations between the Soviet Union and Indonesia." Western news agencies also revealed that "Gromyko has accepted an invitation to visit Indonesia."

To support the right-wing military regime in Indonesia, which is facing serious economic difficulties, the Soviet revisionist leadership, which has nearly $1.2 billion in claims on Indonesia, has expressed a "willingness to seriously consider Indonesia's request to defer debt repayment." After Malik left the Soviet Union, Suprayogi, the chairman of Indonesia's Financial Audit Agency, will continue to stay for "more detailed and technical talks" with the Soviet side.

In coordination with the dirty dealings between the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, Malik and Gromyko also discussed the Vietnam problem.

    苏修集团为马利克提供反华反共讲台
    马利克同苏修领导人会谈后表示满意
    新华社二十三日讯  莫斯科消息：苏联修正主义领导人同双手沾满鲜血的印尼法西斯政权的外交部长马利克之间，最近在莫斯科进行了一场肮脏的反革命政治买卖。马利克是在刚刚访美回国之后，在十七日至二十二日到苏联访问的。
    在马利克的这次酝酿已久的访问之前，苏联和印尼的官员以及它们的宣传机器曾一再互相吹捧，表示“团结合作”的愿望。苏联修正主义领导集团在九月初公然无理驱逐了印度尼西亚共产党机关报《人民日报》驻莫斯科记者安瓦尔·达尔马，作为欢迎马利克的友好姿态。紧接着，苏联驻印度尼西亚大使塞坚科在九月中旬会见印尼右派军人政权头目苏哈托，吹捧这个已经公开投靠美帝国主义的反动政权在“继续执行它的反帝反殖政策”，表示“苏联政府对印尼政府的态度仍然不变”。
    马利克在苏联受到了隆重的接待，他同苏联部长会议主席柯西金、外交部长葛罗米柯、对外经济联络委员会主席斯卡奇科夫分别举行了会谈。
    在马利克访问期间，苏联领导人公然为他提供反华反共的讲坛。据安塔拉通讯社报道，马利克在十八日在斯卡奇科夫为他举行的欢迎宴会上发表长篇讲话，诬蔑中国干涉印度尼西亚的内政，大肆诽谤攻击印度尼西亚共产党，为印尼右派反动势力镇压共产党和人民的血腥罪行进行辩解。同时，马利克表示，印尼右派反动势力镇压印度尼西亚共产党“是印度尼西亚的内政问题”，他希望这一行动“将不致妨碍和影响印尼和苏联之间现存的友好关系”。他还说，由苏哈托领导的印尼右派军人政权“热望（保持）同苏联的友好关系和合作”。
    尽管苏联宣传机器对双方会谈的内容和结果严格保密。但是，据西方通讯社报道，马利克在二十二日离开莫斯科之前心满意足地说，他的这次访问“对印度尼西亚说来是很令人满意的”，他同柯西金、葛罗米柯等人的会谈“已带来苏联和印尼之间的谅解和更密切的关系”。西方通讯社还透露，“葛罗米柯已接受邀请访问印度尼西亚”。
    为了支持面临严重经济困难的印尼右派军人政权，对印尼拥有将近十二亿美元的债权的苏联修正主义领导集团已表示“愿意对印度尼西亚延期偿还债务的要求给予认真的考虑”。在马利克离开苏联之后，印尼财政审核机构主席苏普腊约基将继续留下同苏联方面举行“更为详细的、技术性的会谈”。
    配合苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义在越南问题上加紧进行的肮脏交易，马利克同葛罗米柯还讨论了越南问题。
