Chairman Mao belongs to the revolutionary people of the world. All revolutionaries trust Mao Zedong Thought. Workers in Mali and Senegal love Chairman Mao and love reading the works of Chairman Mao.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bamako: Workers in Mali and Senegal love Chairman Mao and love reading the works of Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically praise, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time," "Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible weapon."

A worker named Musa from Mali often reads the works of Chairman Mao. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun, illuminating our path to revolution."

Another worker, when talking about his thoughts on studying the works of Chairman Mao, said, "People can find the correct methods to solve all problems encountered in life, work, and struggle in the works of Chairman Mao. Therefore, I say, Chairman Mao is the great genius of the world's people."

He emphasized, "Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible weapon to overcome all difficulties," "Chairman Mao belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to the people of the whole world."

A worker from Senegal said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. All revolutionaries in the world trust Mao Zedong Thought."

Another worker from Senegal recently, after reading the works of Chairman Mao, wrote in an article, "The American imperialists and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party will never be able to stop the victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The Chinese Cultural Revolution is combined with the invincible thought of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist theorist and great leader of our times." He said, "The Chinese Cultural Revolution is not only a weapon of the Chinese people but also a powerful weapon given by beloved Chairman Mao to the world proletariat. The people will use this weapon to forever eliminate imperialism, with American imperialism—the number one enemy of the people of all countries—as the leader, and its accomplices—the revisionists led by the Soviet leadership."

    据新华社巴马科电  马里和塞内加尔工人热爱毛主席、爱读毛主席著作。他们满怀激情地赞扬“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”，“毛泽东思想是战无不胜的武器”。
    一位名叫穆萨的马里工人经常阅读毛主席著作。他说：“毛泽东思想就像太阳一样，照耀着我们走上革命的道路。”
    另一位工人在谈到他学习毛主席著作的感想时说：“人们能够在毛主席著作里找到正确的办法来解决生活中、工作中和斗争中所遇到的一切问题。所以我说，毛主席是世界人民的伟大天才。”
    他强调说：“毛泽东思想是战胜一切困难的战无不胜的斗争武器”，“毛主席不仅属于中国人民，而且也属于全世界人民。”
    一位塞内加尔工人说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，全世界一切革命者都信赖毛泽东思想。”
    塞内加尔另一位工人最近读了毛主席著作后在一篇文章中写道：“美帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者永远也阻挡不了中国文化大革命的胜利，中国文化大革命是同我们时代杰出的马克思列宁主义理论家和伟大领袖的战无不胜的思想结合在一起的。”他说：“中国文化大革命不仅仅是中国人民的武器，而且也是敬爱的毛泽东交给世界无产阶级的强有力的武器，人民使用这个武器将永远消灭以美帝国主义——世界各国人民的头号敌人——为首的帝国主义及其帮凶——以苏联领导集团为首的修正主义者。”
