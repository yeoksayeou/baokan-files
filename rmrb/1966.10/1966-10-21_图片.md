Great Leader Chairman Mao, we come from all corners of the country, gathering by your side. We draw strength from your works, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will be your good students, forever following you through storms and waves!
