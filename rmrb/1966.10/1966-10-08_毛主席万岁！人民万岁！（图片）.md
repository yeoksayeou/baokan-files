Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the people!

Great leader Chairman Mao, you love the masses the most, you trust the masses the most. You are always with the masses, always with the masses heart to heart. The comrades in our drilling team love to read your books and listen to your words the most. We must engrave your instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. This is Chairman Mao conversing warmly with worker Wang Youfa of the 32111 Drilling Team at the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Great leader Chairman Mao, you are the reddest sun in our hearts. We must remember your teachings: care about national affairs, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! We will follow you closely, surmount all obstacles, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly forever in the world, fly high.

Model soldier Wang Yuchang and the heroic comrades of the 32111 Drilling Team, who fought through fire, along with the Red Guards, gathered together. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire.

The Red Guards pinned shining gold Mao badges on the chest of the father of martyr OuYang Hai, OuYang Hengwen. The Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. The image of hero OuYang Hai inspires the young revolutionaries to advance bravely.

In the days celebrating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the "Iron Man" of Daqing, Wang Jinxi, and the mother of martyr Liu Yingjun, Zhu Xulan, had a warm meeting. They expressed: We will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to achieve greater victories on different battlefronts.

The Red Guards eagerly shook hands with the father of martyr Wang Jie, Wang Rutan. They expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from comrade Wang Jie's spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death and dedicating himself to the revolution, temper themselves in the great winds and waves of the revolution, and become good successors of the proletariat.
