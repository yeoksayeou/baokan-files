The path that the Chinese people have taken is the best. I am a chemistry student, but studying chemistry cannot save the nation. Only by reading the works of Mao Zedong can one save the nation. We need the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" just as we need bread every day.

    读毛主席的书才能够救国
    中国人走过的路是最好的。我是学化学的，学化学救不了国，读毛泽东的著作才能救国。我们需要《毛泽东选集》就像每天需要面包一样。
