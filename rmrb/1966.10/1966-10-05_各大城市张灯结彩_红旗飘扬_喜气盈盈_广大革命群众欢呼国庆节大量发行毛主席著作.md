	Major cities across the country are adorned with lanterns and red flags, creating a joyous atmosphere. Revolutionary masses nationwide are celebrating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the widespread distribution of Chairman Mao's works.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, during the celebration of the great national holiday marking the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, major cities across the country have distributed large quantities of Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionary masses who are celebrating the festival and have received revolutionary treasures regard this as a double blessing. They have expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	On October 2nd, Beijing distributed 150,000 copies of the popular edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and 6,000 bound copies. Revolutionary masses finally obtained the long-awaited revolutionary treasures. Many revolutionary students and teachers from other provinces who came to Beijing the day before saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square, and on this day, they also received Chairman Mao's works. They said, "This trip to Beijing is truly a great happiness!"

	During the National Day holiday, Shanghai distributed 200,000 copies of the simplified Chinese horizontal edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for the first time. On the 1st and 2nd, from morning to night, large numbers of revolutionary masses continuously rushed to the more than 350 Xinhua Bookstores, bookstalls, supply and marketing cooperatives, and some postal and telecommunications department newspaper and periodical sales outlets distributed in the city center, industrial areas, and rural market towns to purchase the new edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." During the National Day holiday, Guangzhou's Xinhua Bookstores, with more than 90 supply points distributed in urban and suburban areas, distributed large quantities of Chairman Mao's works. On the 1st and 2nd, the city distributed more than 60,000 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and 85,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," as well as a large number of single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works. During the National Day holiday, tens of millions of revolutionary masses in Shenyang, Xi'an, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places received Chairman Mao's works.

	During the holiday, the Xinhua Bookstores in various cities hung large portraits of Chairman Mao, decorated with lanterns, and flew red flags, creating a joyous atmosphere. Revolutionary workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary youth who had been eagerly awaiting Chairman Mao's works for days and nights heard the good news of the distribution of Chairman Mao's works and rushed to the bookstores like a tide, queuing up to wait. With immense excitement, they read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" aloud in front of the bookstores and sang revolutionary songs such as "The Ship Sails on Because of the Helmsman." Many people also voluntarily and enthusiastically helped the bookstores with their work. Those who received Chairman Mao's works were overjoyed, congratulating each other, and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" Revolutionary staff of Xinhua Bookstores in various places worked day and night before the holiday to prepare for the large-scale distribution of Chairman Mao's works. Many people repeatedly studied articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," determined to complete this glorious task with high revolutionary enthusiasm. In addition to setting up more bookstores, many cities also sent out mobile vehicles to directly distribute Chairman Mao's works to schools, industrial areas, residential areas, and suburbs. On October 1st, Shenyang held a celebration meeting for the distribution of the simplified Chinese horizontal edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in front of the Xinhua Bookstore on Anti-Revisionism Street. Active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the PLA Shenyang Garrison, such as Liao Chujiang, and active learners from Shenyang City, such as Wen Shumin, spoke at the meeting. When the municipal committee's responsible comrade announced the start of the distribution of Chairman Mao's works, firecrackers exploded, and drums beat, and people lined up to enter the bookstore to purchase revolutionary treasures.

	After receiving Chairman Mao's works, revolutionary masses in various places determined to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to imprint Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, to infuse it into their blood, and to implement it in their actions. Some people, after receiving Chairman Mao's works, wrote excitedly on the spot: "Today, I bought 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' It is the happiest and most unforgettable day of my life. Chairman Mao! I will definitely read your books better, listen to your words, and be your good student for life." Some Red Guards who came from Fujian to Beijing for revolutionary linking-up were extremely excited after receiving "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and specially took a photo with Chairman Mao's book at Tiananmen Square. They determined to read Chairman Mao's books better and to propagate Mao Zedong Thought better. Revolutionary teachers and students of Hubei University in Wuhan expressed at the celebration meeting for the distribution of Chairman Mao's works that they would definitely take Chairman Mao's works as weapons, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle in the Cultural Revolution, and resolutely complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, turning Hubei University into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.
