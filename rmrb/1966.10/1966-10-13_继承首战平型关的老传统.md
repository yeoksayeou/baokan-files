	In our new era of socialism, the emergence of heroic collectives like the 3211 Drilling Team is a source of pride for all the people of the nation. The heroes are able to achieve this because they study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, turning Mao Zedong Thought into their very souls. I am determined, together with the militia of Pingxingguan, to learn from these heroes, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, to carry forward and develop the revolutionary tradition of bravery and self-sacrifice shown by the old Eighth Route Army in the First Battle of Pingxingguan. We will farm on the one hand and train on the other, actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly establish a sense of preparedness for war, heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and master the skills to defeat the enemy. If the enemy dares to impose war on us, we will make sure it comes back with nothing, and we will completely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilate it!

    继承首战平型关的老传统
    在我们社会主义新时代，出现了三二一一一钻井队这样的英雄集体，是全国人民的骄傲。英雄们所以能这样，是活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想化作自己的灵魂的结果。我决心和平型关的民兵一起，向英雄学习，活学活用毛主席著作，继承和发扬老八路首战平型关时表现出的英勇奋斗、不怕牺牲的革命传统，一面种田，一面练武，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，牢固树立战备观念，提高革命警惕，练好杀敌本领。如果敌人敢于把战争加在我们头上，一定叫它有来无回，全部、彻底、干净地消灭它！
