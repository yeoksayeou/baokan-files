We must dare to innovate and be different, innovating in the new socialist spirit and being different in the proletarian way. The fundamental task of socialist literature and art is to strive to create heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Editor's Note: On this great National Day, amidst the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, amateur performance troupes from the forefront of the three great revolutionary movements have taken the stage of socialist literature and art as masters. The amateur performance troupe of workers and families from the Daqing Oil Field, the amateur performance troupe of peasants from the famous Sandstone Ravine, Wugong, and Guozhuang in Hebei Province, and the amateur performance troupe of soldiers stationed in Beijing have jointly performed, showcasing the creative abilities of workers, peasants, and soldiers in creating socialist culture.

The amateur performance troupes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with strong class sentiments, use the newest and most beautiful language to praise our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, to praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to praise the heroic figures armed with Mao Zedong Thought, to praise the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, and to praise the lofty ideal of communism. They have turned the stage into a platform for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the theater into a classroom for learning Mao Zedong Thought. In their minds, the most glorious, happiest, most urgent, and fundamental task is to be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

These programs that enthusiastically praise the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. From their enthusiastic comments, it is vividly reflected how the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers yearn to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls, arm their minds, and inspire their fighting spirit.

Workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, as well as the main force in the Cultural Revolution. We must rely on workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly criticize bourgeois literature and art, create new socialist literature and art, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Sing Praises to Chairman Mao

Sun Youchun, Worker at Beijing Cable Factory

We workers, peasants, and soldiers have an infinite love for the Party and our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. What language can express our love and gratitude for the Party and Chairman Mao? What songs can sing out our deep affection for Chairman Mao? We shout "Long live Chairman Mao" thousands of times, but it still cannot express our heartfelt admiration for the great leader. This time, the joint performance by workers, peasants, and soldiers has sung out the songs from our hearts, singing out our deepest affection for the great leader Chairman Mao. How can we not cheer for this successful performance!

Every program performed by the amateur performance troupe of workers and families from the Daqing Oil Field is very genuine and moving. The song and dance "Daqing People Forever Follow Chairman Mao" expresses the Daqing people's boundless love for Chairman Mao. They follow the Party and Chairman Mao with one heart. In this Cultural Revolution, they have used their own experiences to refute the various fallacies of the ghosts and snakes who oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

The Daqing people love to read Chairman Mao's books the most. The Daqing people firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible ideological weapon, so they can fight against heaven and earth, subdue dragons and tigers, and be invincible. "Daqing Workers Report Victory" shows the heroic spirit of Daqing people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. At the end of this program, when the Daqing workers report the victory of the oil field to Chairman Mao, the performers on stage were so moved that they shed tears. This is such a sincere feeling for the great leader Chairman Mao! This makes the audience below the stage feel that they are not watching a performance but are reporting the victory to Chairman Mao together with the Daqing workers.

Only those who love Chairman Mao, the Party, and the motherland infinitely, and only those who have fought against the wilderness like the Daqing people, can perform this program so intimately, so movingly, so realistically, and so successfully.

Peasants are not only good at farming but also excellent at performing on stage. The song and dance "Eight Sisters Struggle for Deep Plowing" performed by the amateur performance troupe of peasants from Hebei Province shows the revolutionary spirit of eight rural women who, for the sake of a bumper grain harvest, dare to struggle against difficulties. In the absence of livestock, they pull the plow to till the land, reading Chairman Mao's quotations: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we will surely win victory." We workers, peasants, and soldiers, when encountering difficulties in the three great revolutionary struggles, always use Chairman Mao's words to inspire ourselves to overcome difficulties. The fact shows that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a material force to transform society and the world.

The performance of workers, peasants, and soldiers has broken the framework of bourgeois art "experts" and "authorities." The performance is both serious and lively, both simple and intimate, and the emotions of the performers and the audience are blended together. This is something that those bourgeois art "experts" and "authorities" have never done and will never be able to do!

    我们要敢于标新立异，就是标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。努力塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵的英雄人物，是社会主义文艺的根本任务。
    编者按：在伟大的国庆节日里，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，来自三大革命第一线的工农兵业余演出队，以主人翁姿态登上了社会主义文艺舞台。
    从英雄大庆来的大庆油田工人、家属业余演出队，从全国闻名的沙石峪、五公、郭庄……来的河北省农民业余演出队和驻京部队战士业余演出队的联合演出，显示了工农兵创造社会主义文化的才能。
    工农兵业余演出队怀着强烈的阶级感情，用最新最美的语言，歌颂我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，歌颂无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，歌颂崇高的共产主义理想。他们把舞台变成了宣传毛泽东思想的讲坛，把剧场变成了学习毛泽东思想的课堂。在他们的心目里，最光荣、最幸福、最迫切、最根本的任务，是当好毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    这些热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂毛泽东思想的节目，受到了广大工农兵群众最热烈的欢迎。从他们的热情洋溢的评论中，鲜明地反映了亿万工农兵群众多么渴望用毛泽东思想来改造自己的灵魂，来武装自己的头脑，来鼓舞自己的斗志。
    工农兵是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的主力军，也是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。我们就是要靠工农兵，彻底批判资产阶级的文艺，创造社会主义的新文艺，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    工农兵齐声歌颂毛主席
    北京有线电厂工人　孙有纯
    我们工农兵无限热爱党，热爱我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。用什么语言能表达出我们对党，对毛主席的热爱和感激？用什么歌子能唱出我们对毛主席的深情厚意？我们千次万次地高呼毛主席万岁，还是表达不尽我们对伟大领袖爱戴的心意。这次工农兵联合演出的节目，唱出了我们心底的歌，唱出了我们对伟大的领袖毛主席最最热爱的深情厚意。我们怎能不欢呼这次成功的演出呢！
    大庆油田工人、家属业余演出队演出的每一个节目都非常真切，非常动人。歌舞《大庆人永远跟着毛主席》，表达了大庆人对毛主席无限热爱的心情。他们一个心眼跟党走，跟毛主席走。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，他们用自己经历的事实，有力地驳斥了那些牛鬼蛇神反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的种种谬论。
    大庆人最爱读毛主席的书，大庆人牢牢地掌握了毛泽东思想这一战无不胜的思想武器，所以他们能够战天斗地，降龙伏虎，无往而不胜。《大庆职工报捷》就表现了这种用毛泽东思想武装起来的大庆人的英雄气概。在这个节目的末尾，当大庆职工拿下了大油田向毛主席报捷的时候，台上的演员激动得流下了眼泪。这是对伟大领袖毛主席多么真挚的感情啊！这使台下的观众感到：自己不是在看节目演出，而是在和大庆职工一起向毛主席报捷。
      只有无限热爱毛主席，热爱党，热爱祖国，只有经过同荒原搏斗的大庆人才能把这个节目演得这样亲切，这样动人，这样逼真，这样成功。
    农民不仅种田是能手，登台演出也是好样的。河北省农民业余演出队演出的歌舞《八大嫂闹深翻》，表现了八位农村妇女为了夺取粮食大丰收，不怕困难、敢于斗争的革命精神。在没有牲畜的情况下，她们拉犁耕田，一面同困难搏斗，一面读着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。我们工农兵在三大革命斗争中遇到困难的时候，总是用毛主席的话来激励自己去战胜困难。事实表明，毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。
    工农兵的演出已经打破了资产阶级艺术“专家”“权威”的那一套框框。演出自始至终既严肃又活泼，既朴实又亲切，演员与观众的感情溶合到一起了。这是那些资产阶级艺术“专家”“权威”过去不曾办到的，也是永远办不到的事！
