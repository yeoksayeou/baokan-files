"The Old Three Articles are eternal! The Old Three Articles are forever the New Three Articles!" This is the enthusiastic praise of the revolutionary masses for Chairman Mao's three brilliant works: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains."

The "Old Three Articles" are powerful ideological weapons for transforming our worldview and are the most fundamental compulsory courses for achieving ideological revolutionization. The broad cadre and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, through repeated study of the "Old Three Articles," have achieved remarkable results in ideological revolutionization, producing communist heroes such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun. They seek neither fame nor wealth, fear neither hardship nor death, and are willing to give their all for the people. For the sake of the Party and the people, they dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, and they will never change even if their bodies are crushed to pieces. The broad masses of workers and peasants, through repeated study of the "Old Three Articles," have produced towering figures like the people of Daqing, the people of Dazhai, the 32111 Hero Drilling Team, and countless other heroic and model figures. Metu, an illiterate peasant woman from Jiangsu Province, precisely because she studied the "Old Three Articles," firmly remembered "three people with one broom," and under the inspiration of the shining examples of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the foolish old man, she broke private interests and established public interests everywhere, becoming a new-type peasant who wholeheartedly serves the collective and the revolution. Countless facts prove that actively learning and applying the "Old Three Articles" have such important significance in changing the spiritual face of the Chinese people and the face of our motherland!

To study the "Old Three Articles" well, the key is to study them with deep proletarian feelings, to learn and apply them actively, and to focus on the "application." If one lacks the strong desire to transform one's thoughts and the firm resolve to focus on "application," even if one reads them a thousand times or ten thousand times, the transformation of one's worldview will still not be significant. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "The Old Three Articles" are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them. This is absolutely true. Every revolutionary comrade must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study the "Old Three Articles" as a motto, study them for a lifetime, apply them for a lifetime, and let the "Old Three Articles" forever be the driving force for our progress.

    “老三篇”永远是“新三篇”
    “‘老三篇’万岁！”“‘老三篇’永远是‘新三篇’。”这是广大革命群众对毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》这三篇光辉著作的热烈赞颂。
    “老三篇”是我们改造世界观的强大思想武器，是实现思想革命化的最根本的必修课。解放军的广大干部战士，由于反复学习了“老三篇”，在思想革命化上取得了显著的成效，涌现了雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、刘英俊等共产主义的英雄战士。他们不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，“掏尽红心为人民”。为了党和人民的利益，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，粉身碎骨，永远不变。广大工农群众，由于反复学习了“老三篇”，就出现了顶天立地的大庆人、大寨人、32111英雄钻井队，以及许许多多英雄模范人物。江苏省不识字的贫农妇女顾阿桃，正是因为学习了“老三篇”，牢牢记住了“三个人一把扫帚”，在张思德、白求恩和老愚公的光辉形象鼓舞下，处处破私立公，成了一个一心为集体，一心为革命的新型农民。无数事实证明，活学活用“老三篇”，对改变我国人民的精神面貌，改变我们祖国的面貌，具有多么重要的意义啊！
    学好“老三篇”，关键在于带着深厚的无产阶级感情去学，活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。如果没有改造思想的强烈愿望，没有在“用”字上狠下功夫的坚强决心，你就是读一千遍，读一万遍，对世界观的改造，还是成效不大。林彪同志指出：“老三篇”最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。这是千真万确的。我们每一个革命同志，都要响应林彪同志的号召，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。学一辈子“老三篇”，用一辈子“老三篇”，让“老三篇”永远成为我们前进的原动力。
