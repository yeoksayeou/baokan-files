The deputy squad leader of the 32111 drilling team, Communist Party member, and demobilized soldier Zhang Yongqing, sacrificed his life in the battle to extinguish a fire and rescue a well.

As people mourn the martyr, they recall his resolute words: "We live for the revolution and are prepared to die for it. If our death benefits the entire revolutionary cause, then we die a worthy death, our deaths weigh heavier than Mount Tai."

Zhang Yongqing lived a glorious life following the instructions of Chairman Mao.

Red-hearted Loyalty to the Revolution

In 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, Zhang Yongqing honorably became a petroleum soldier.

In his work, Zhang Yongqing always remembered the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, showing unwavering loyalty to the revolutionary cause and fully embodying the spirit of proletarian revolutionary heroism. He dared to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire.

Once, an oil well caught fire. After the flames on the ground were extinguished, the fire on the twenty-meter-high second platform was still burning. Thinking of the people's interests as his command, Zhang Yongqing disregarded his own safety and immediately climbed onto the second platform, quickly extinguishing the fire. His comrades praised him for his bravery. Zhang Yongqing said, "Courage is a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the revolution."

Another time, a well blew out, seriously threatening the safety of the driller and the drilling site. Zhang Yongqing rushed onto the drilling platform, using his body to protect the driller. No matter how much mud splashed onto his body or how many stones hit him, he remained steadfast, bravely safeguarding the safety of his class comrades and the drilling site.

This May, during a severe well blowout, the "gas tiger" was particularly ferocious. The equipment used to control the blowout, the back-pressure valve, was blown off as soon as it was installed, blown off again as soon as it was reinstalled. In this critical moment, Zhang Yongqing grabbed the back-pressure valve, leaped up, and pressed it down with his body, shouting, "Press! Press! Press on me!"

Several hands pressed down on Zhang Yongqing. The pressure from the well pushed up, while his comrades' strength pushed down. How painful it must have been! But a person who puts revolutionary interests first is an iron-willed hero. Zhang Yongqing did not utter a sound. He continued to shout loudly, "Press and push, push flat!" Zhang Yongqing's body became the handle, and his comrades pushed, turning it once, twice... Finally, the back-pressure valve was installed, and the "gas tiger" was subdued. After the battle, a large area of muscle on Zhang Yongqing's stomach, the size of a bowl, was pressed and turned purple-black by the back-pressure valve.

"Keep Your Heart on the Well"

In his daily work, Zhang Yongqing was also loyal to the Party. He believed that every specific task in finding gas and oil was an execution of Chairman Mao's instructions and should be done responsibly for the people.

Every time he checked the internal threads of the drilling tools, not even a half-thread crack escaped his eyes. He said, "A half-thread crack is a time bomb."

To find a screw, he searched for over two hours in the muddy round well after work until he found it. He said, "Losing a screw means losing the heart of responsibility to the people."

If there was an error in the production records, he would run to the well site in the middle of the night to correct it. Someone said, "Correct it tomorrow." He replied, "Errors must be corrected immediately and cannot be left overnight. This is being responsible to the people."

One day in 1964, the team held a field meeting. The sealing device they installed did not meet the specifications, and Zhang Yongqing felt very upset. He was the first to speak, saying, "The sealing device was not installed properly, indicating that we lack the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people." He tightened the screws while speaking to his classmates, "Our hearts should be like the screws on the sealing device, always tightened on the well."

This May, Zhang Yongqing's squad was tasked with testing a new gas layer. By then, Zhang Yongqing had been working for several days despite being ill. For several meals, he could only barely drink some rice soup and porridge. Before one shift, the squad leader advised him to rest. He said, "To carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on finding gas and oil, as soon as I hear the drilling machine, I am no longer ill."

That day, he could barely stand on the operating platform. But he said, "Small illnesses fear resolve, big illnesses fear the revolution," and he leaned his body against the separator, firmly guarding his post. During mealtime, he only drank a few sips of water. The squad leader saw this and advised him to rest again, but it was ineffective, so he asked the instructor to persuade him. He earnestly told the instructor, "American imperialism is invading Vietnam and is about to reach our doorstep. At this time of competing with the enemy for every second, if I can produce gas one minute earlier, I am willing to sacrifice myself on duty."

Zhang Yongqing's illness worsened, and he was sent to the hospital. However, after a few days, he repeatedly requested to be discharged. Before his illness was fully recovered, he returned to the well site.

Concern for Others is Greater than Concern for Oneself

"Concern for others is greater than concern for oneself." Zhang Yongqing firmly carried out Chairman Mao's instruction.

Among the martyr's belongings, there was a mosquito net with many patches. This was a mosquito net that shone with communist light.

In July 1964, the driller Chen Mingzhi had just been transferred and had a tattered mosquito net on his bed. Late at night, Chen felt someone lightly fanning away mosquitoes for him. After three nights, Chen still did not know who did this, and he was puzzled. Zhang Yongqing walked over and said, "Let's exchange mosquito nets, okay?" Chen Mingzhi then realized that it was this unnamed teacher who had been caring for him.

In the evening, Chen Mingzhi returned from playing basketball and saw that Zhang Yongqing had already exchanged the mosquito nets.

Zhang Yongqing was very thrifty in his life. The cotton coat he wore, the quilt he covered, and the cotton padding he slept on were all issued to him in 1953 when he was a soldier in the army. The union chairman knew his family was in financial difficulty and said to him, "If you have difficulties, we can provide some assistance." Zhang Yongqing replied, "We cannot just think of ourselves. As long as we think of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, it is joyful to be a little hard on ourselves."

Zhang Yongqing regarded helping his class brothers as his greatest happiness. In January 1962, Zhang Yongqing stayed in the home of an elderly poor peasant who had no children. The elderly couple's bedding was very thin, and Zhang Yongqing thought: everything a Communist Party member has is given by the Party, and we cannot ignore the difficulties of our class brothers. He immediately took a new six-jin quilt from his bed and gave it to the elderly poor peasant, leaving himself with a thin army-issued quilt. The elderly poor peasant was moved and asked him, "Do you have anyone in your family?" Zhang Yongqing just said, "I am also a sufferer from the old society."

Diligently Transforming One's Soul

The growth of every revolutionary fighter is inseparable from Mao Zedong Thought. Zhang Yongqing was no exception.

In 1961, Zhang Yongqing began studying Chairman Mao's works. He studied diligently, transforming his soul bit by bit, and overcoming selfish thoughts. He wrote in his diary, "A knife is not sharp without grinding, water does not boil without heating, and a person cannot become a revolutionary without studying Chairman Mao's works." He learned a little, used a little, repeatedly learned, and repeatedly used. No matter how late it was, he always studied a section of Chairman Mao's works before sleeping; even when he had a high fever in the hospital, he still did not put down the book. Until his last moment.

On the night of June 21, Zhang Yongqing studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune" under the lamp again. He studied and thought, and then wrote neatly on the margin, "Every revolutionary fighter, living, must completely and thoroughly serve the people." After finishing, he did not close the book, and the pen was still on it. He changed into his work clothes, put on his helmet, and strode towards the brightly lit well site. Soon, he bravely sacrificed himself in the battle against the flames.

Comrades mourned Zhang Yongqing, saying: he lived like Lei Feng and died like Wang Jie. He is another shining example for our working class.

    以革命利益为第一生命
    ——记石油工业部五好标兵、模范共产党员张永庆烈士
    32111钻井队的副班长、共产党员、转业军人张永庆，在灭火救井的战斗中，光荣地献出了自己的生命。
    人们在悲痛地悼念烈士的时候，耳边响起了他生前铿锵的声音：“我们为革命而生，也要准备为革命而死。如果我们的死，有利于整个革命事业，就是死得其所，死有重于泰山。”
    张永庆按照毛主席的指示，度过了光辉的一生。
    赤胆忠心为革命
    在一九五八年大跃进的年月里，张永庆光荣地成为一名石油战士。
    在工作中，张永庆牢记着伟大领袖毛主席的教导，对革命事业赤胆忠心，高度发扬了无产阶级革命英雄主义精神，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。
    有一次，油井着火。地面上的火焰扑灭以后，二十多米高的二层平台上还在燃烧。张永庆想到人民的利益就是命令，不顾个人的生死安危，立即爬上二层台，很快把火扑灭。同志们都称赞他胆子大。张永庆说：“胆子，就是对党对革命的高度责任心。”
    又有一次井喷，严重地威胁着司钻和井场的安全。张永庆一个箭步，冲上钻台，用自己的身体掩护着司钻。任凭泥浆往自己身上喷刺，任凭砂石往自己身上射来，毫不动摇，英勇地保卫了阶级弟兄和井场的安全。
    今年五月发生的一次强烈井喷，“气老虎”特别凶猛。控制井喷的设备——回压凡尔，一戴上去，就被冲下来，再戴上去，再被冲下来……。在这紧急关头，张永庆抱起回压凡尔，一跃而起，连人带回压凡尔一齐压了上去，喊道：“压！压！压住我！”
    十几只手同时压向张永庆。井下的压力往上顶，同志们的力量向下压，这是多么难受呵！但是，以革命利益为第一生命的人，是铁打的英雄汉。张永庆没有吭一声。他继续大声喊：“压着推，推平！”张永庆的身体成了推柄，同志们推着，一转、两转……，终于戴上了回压凡尔，制服了“气老虎”。战斗结束以后，张永庆肚子上碗口大的一块肌肉，被回压凡尔顶压得变成了紫黑色。
    “把心拧在井口上”
    张永庆在日常工作中，也是对党忠心耿耿。他认为，找气找油的每一项具体工作，都是执行毛主席的指示，都应当对人民负责。
      每次检查钻具的内丝扣，半丝裂纹都逃不过他的眼睛。他说：“一丝裂纹就是一颗定时炸弹。”
      为了找一颗螺丝，他下班以后，在满是泥浆的圆井里，摸了两个多钟头，直到把它找到。他说：“丢了一颗螺丝，就是丢了向人民负责的心。”
    生产记录错一个字，他半夜跑到井场去改。有人说：“明天再改吧。”他说：“有错就要改，不能过夜。这是向人民负责。”
    一九六四年的一天，队里召开现场会。他们安装的封井器不合规格，张永庆心里很难受，第一个发言说：“封井器没有装好，说明我们缺乏完全、彻底为人民服务的思想。”他边紧螺丝，边对班里同志说：“咱们的心，要像封井器上的螺丝一样，时刻都拧在井口上。”
    今年五月，张永庆班担负了测试一个新气层的任务。这时，张永庆已经带病坚持工作好几天了。好几餐，他只能勉强喝些米汤和面羹。一天上班以前，班长劝他休息。他说：“为了贯彻执行毛主席的找气找油指示，我一听钻机响，就没有病了。”
    这天，他在操纵台上站都站不稳。可是，他说：“小病怕决心，大病怕革命”，他使劲把身体靠在分离器上，坚守岗位。吃饭时，他只喝了几口开水。班长见他这样，再次劝他休息，没有效果，就请指导员来说服他。他恳切地对指导员说：“美帝国主义侵略越南，快要打到我国的大门口。在这同敌人争分夺秒的时候，只要能早一分钟拿出气来，我就是牺牲在岗位上，也心甘情愿。”
    张永庆的病更重了，被送进了医院。但是，没有过几天，他一次又一次地要求出院。病还没有好，就回到井场。
    关心他人比关心自己为重
    “关心他人比关心自己为重。”张永庆坚决执行了毛主席的这一教导。
    在烈士的遗物中，有一顶补了很多补钉的蚊帐。这是一顶闪耀着共产主义光芒的蚊帐。
    一九六四年七月，钻工陈明思刚调来，床上挂着一顶破破烂烂的蚊帐。深夜，小陈在迷迷糊糊中，感到有人用扇子在轻轻给自己赶蚊子。三夜过去了，小陈还不知道这些事情是谁做的，他正在纳闷，张永庆走过来说：“咱们俩把蚊帐换一换，怎么样？”小陈这才明白，是这位不知姓名的师傅在关心自己。
      傍晚，陈明思打篮球回来，一看，蚊帐已经让张永庆给换过去了。
      张永庆在生活上十分勤俭。他穿的棉大衣，盖的棉被，铺的棉絮，还是一九五三年在部队当兵时发的。工会组长知道他家生活困难，对他说：“有困难，补助点。”张永庆却说：“我们不能光想到个人。只要想到中国革命和世界革命，自己艰苦点，也是愉快的。”
    张永庆把帮助阶级兄弟，看作是自己的最大的幸福。一九六二年一月，张永庆住在一户无儿无女的老贫农家里。老贫农夫妇铺的盖的都很单薄，张永庆心想：共产党员的一切都是党给的，不能看着阶级兄弟有困难不管。他毫不犹豫地从自己床上取起一床六斤重的新絮，送给老贫农，给自己留下一床部队发的薄棉絮。老贫农激动地问他：“你家里还有什么人？”张永庆只是说：“我也是旧社会的受苦人。”
    刻苦地改造自己的灵魂
    一切革命战士的成长，都离不了毛泽东思想。张永庆也是这样。
    一九六一年，张永庆开始学习毛主席著作。他认真地学习，刻苦地改造自己的灵魂，一点一滴地克服私心杂念。他在日记中写道：“刀不磨不快，水不烧不开，人不学毛主席著作，就当不了革命派”。他学一点，用一点，反复学，反复用。不管多晚，他总要学上一段毛主席著作再睡；在医院发高烧时仍然手不释卷。直到他生命的最后一刻。
    六月二十一日深夜，张永庆在灯光下又一次学习了伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》。他学着、想着，又在书眉上端端正正地加上了一段话：“我们每个革命者，活着，就是要完全彻底为人民服务。”学完，书没有合上，上面搁着钢笔，他便换上工衣，戴上铝盔，大踏步地向灯火辉煌的井场走去。不久，他就在同烈火搏斗中英勇牺牲了。
    战友们悼念张永庆说：他像雷锋那样活着，像王杰那样死去。他是我们工人阶级又一个光辉的榜样。
