One morning, a little girl wearing a red scarf came to the gate of the Ministry of Culture. She took out a square package from her schoolbag and handed it to the duty officer at the guardhouse, then ran quickly towards the street, disappearing into the crowd.

The comrades at the Ministry of Culture opened the package marked "Confidential" and found inside it 1,100 yuan in cash, along with a letter full of revolutionary fervor. The letter began by denouncing the crimes of Zhou Yang and his gang in obstructing the publication of Chairman Mao's works. It then continued with passionate words:

"We love Chairman Mao the most, and we yearn the most for Mao Zedong Thought, the invincible weapon of mankind. With it, the revolutionary path has a direction; with it, no difficulty is feared; with it, the heart is broad and the eyes are bright; with it, communism will surely be realized.

"My father and mother are both Communist Party members. My father has retired, and my mother is still an ordinary public servant. ... Words cannot express our boundless love for Chairman Mao and our boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought. When we saw that the Party Central Committee had decided to publish a large number of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' we were overjoyed. Now, we are sending the savings of our family over the years, 1,100 yuan, to the publishing house to contribute a little to the publication of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' The more copies of Chairman Mao's works are printed, the more people will master Mao Zedong Thought, the stronger the revolutionary forces will be, and the sooner communism will be realized. Let Mao Zedong Thought be passed down for generations and generations forever!"

The letter was signed: "Successors of the Chinese Revolution." After reading this letter full of boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, many comrades at the Ministry of Culture were moved and said, "We must learn from this revolutionary family, and we must find this family!"

In the vast sea of people, where do we start looking? A comrade accidentally found a clue in the package: a small piece of paper used to tie the cash had a bank teller's stamp on it.

The comrades at the Ministry of Culture followed this clue and immediately began tracking and investigating. The police station, savings office, and many units' comrades all rushed to find this "Successor of the Chinese Revolution." They also posted the letter on blackboards and wall newspapers to educate more people.

After five days of effort, they finally solved the mystery. It turned out that the little girl was named Lin Xiaohua, 14 years old, a second-year student at Dongfanghong Fourth Middle School (Dengshikou Girls' School). Her father and mother both came from poor peasant families and had joined the revolution in the midst of war, holding deep feelings for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

When they saw the big-character poster in the People's Daily titled "Accusation of Zhou Yang's Crimes in Obstructing the Publication of Chairman Mao's Works," they were very indignant. On July 25, the Lin family held a special family meeting to discuss this matter. Xiaohua's father said, "From now on, we should not only study Chairman Mao's works ourselves but also find ways to let more people master Mao Zedong Thought."

Xiaohua's father and mother proposed using the money the family had saved through thrift to buy several hundred copies of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' to give to others. However, they were afraid they couldn't buy so many books at once. Finally, it was Xiaohua who came up with the idea: to send all the savings to the publishing house to add a sum of money for the large-scale publication of Chairman Mao's works!

Her suggestion was immediately supported by the whole family. But how to send the money? Her mother said, "Send it through the post office." Xiaohua thought, "Sending it through the post office requires an address. We should learn from Liu Yingjun and not let people know our names. Sending it by post is not a good idea." Finally, they decided: Xiaohua would deliver it to the Ministry of Culture.

That night, Xiaohua drafted the letter. The next morning, Xiaohua took off her school badge, carried the packaged letter and money, and set off from home. The mission was completed very smoothly. When Xiaohua ran out of the Ministry of Culture's gate, she was as happy as a little swallow, flying back home.

Afterward, the family established a rule: this matter is only for the family to know, and it must be kept absolutely secret from outsiders!

The next day after this "secret" was revealed, reporters came to Lin Xiaohua's home. As soon as they entered the door, they saw that every room had colorful portraits and photos of the great leader Chairman Mao. In Xiaohua's room, there was also a plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations. Xiaohua's father and mother said that this plaque with quotations was established by Xiaohua in 1964 when their family received the first copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." She would change the quotation every two or three days according to the domestic and international situation and the thoughts of her family and herself, and she had never stopped for more than two years. Since she entered junior high school, she had been studying Chairman Mao's works. After school, she often studied "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Since the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, Lin Xiaohua had repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works on class and class struggle. She followed Chairman Mao's teachings and actively participated in the struggle, criticism, and transformation at school and in society, becoming a little revolutionary in the cultural revolution.

Growing up in a revolutionary family, Xiaohua had been influenced by revolutionary traditions since she was young. Her father often educated them to never forget class bitterness and to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and self-reliance of the old Red Army and the Eighth Route Army. Xiaohua had a small jacket that she had worn since she was ten years old, with two sleeves that had been lengthened and patched seventeen times, all sewn by her one stitch at a time. Every year, Xiaohua's family would go to the countryside several times to dig wild vegetables to eat. Every time they ate wild vegetables, they would remember the Red Army and the Eighth Route Army, and the countless revolutionary heroes who had sacrificed their lives for the cause of people's liberation, and they would love the Party and Chairman Mao even more.

The Ministry of Culture, to commend Lin Xiaohua's family for their boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, specially sent people to Lin Xiaohua's home to present them with "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other works of Chairman Mao. After persuasion and explanation, they returned the 1,100 yuan donated by Xiaohua to her family. On that day, Xiaohua and her two sisters wore their father's old military uniforms and red armbands, enthusiastically receiving the comrades from the Ministry of Culture. They expressed that in the future, they would definitely read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and temper themselves into strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the great winds and waves of class struggle.

    小姑娘送来的“密件”
    章墨渊
    一个早晨，文化部的门前来了一位戴着红领巾的小姑娘。她从书包里取出一个方方正正的纸包交给传达室的值班人员，就飞也似地跑向大街，隐没到人群中去了。
    文化部的同志打开这个标有“密件”字样的纸包，发现里面包着一千一百元人民币，还附有一封充满革命激情的信。信上一开头就痛斥了周扬一伙阻挠出版毛主席著作的罪行，接着就满腔热情地写道：
    “我们最最热爱毛主席，最最渴望得到毛泽东思想这个人类战无不胜的武器。有了它，革命道路有方向；有了它，什么困难都不怕；有了它，心胸开阔眼睛亮；有了它，共产主义定实现。
    “我的爸爸、妈妈都是共产党员。爸爸已经退休，妈妈现在还是一个普通的人民勤务员。……千言万语表达不完我们对毛主席的无限热爱，表达不完我们对毛泽东思想的无限信仰。当我们看到党中央已决定大量出版《毛泽东选集》的时候，高兴得不知怎么好了。现将我家多年来节余的人民币一千一百元送上，请转交出版机关，为大量出版《毛泽东选集》献上一点点经费。多印一本毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想的人就多一个，革命队伍也就能壮大一些，共产主义也就能早一天实现。让毛泽东思想千代万代永远传下去吧！……”
    信的署名是：中国革命接班人。看完这封充满对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱的信，文化部许多同志都激动地说，一定要向这个革命家庭学习，一定要把这一家人找到！
    茫茫人海，从哪里找起呢？一位同志无意中从纸包里发现了一个线索：在捆扎人民币的小纸条上盖有银行出纳员的印章。
    文化部的同志循着这个线索，立即开始跟踪寻查。派出所、储蓄所和许多单位的同志都为寻找这位“中国革命接班人”奔忙起来。他们还把这封信登在黑板报和墙报上，让更多的人受到教育。
    经过五天的努力，他们终于把这个谜底揭开了。原来那位小姑娘叫林小华，今年十四岁，是东方红四中（灯市口女中）二年级的学生。她的父亲和母亲都出生在贫下中农的家庭，早在战火纷飞的年代就参加了革命，对党中央和毛主席怀有深厚的感情。
      当他们从《人民日报》上看到《控诉周扬阻挠出版毛主席著作的罪行》的大字报以后，都十分气愤。七月二十五日，林小华家专门为这件事开了一个家庭会议。小华的爸爸说：“咱们以后不能光自己学习毛主席著作，还要想办法让更多的人掌握毛泽东思想。”
    小华的父亲和母亲提议把全家省吃俭用储蓄起来的钱，拿出来买几百套《毛泽东选集》赠送给别人。但是，又怕一下子买不到那么多书。最后还是小华想出了个主意：把积蓄的钱都送给出版机关，为大量出版毛主席著作增添一笔经费！
    她的建议立刻得到全家的拥护。可是钱怎么送出去呢？母亲说：“从邮局寄。”小华一想，从邮局寄要留地址，咱们学刘英俊，不能让人家知道我们的名字，邮寄的办法不好。最后决定：由小华送到文化部去。
    当晚，小华把信起草好了。第二天上午，小华摘下胸前的校徽，带着包扎好了的信和钱，从家里出发了。这次任务完成得非常顺利。当小华从文化部大门里跑出来的时候，高兴得像一只小燕子，飞也似地跑回了家。
    事后全家订了一条纪律：这件事只许家里人知道，对外绝对保密！
    这个“秘密”被揭开的第二天，记者来到林小华家。一进门，只见所有的房间里，都挂着伟大领袖毛主席的彩色画像和照片。小华住的房间里，还挂着一块毛主席语录牌。小华的爸爸妈妈说，这块语录牌是一九六四年他们家得到第一本《毛主席语录》的时候，小华自动建立起来的。她针对每个时期的国内外形势，针对家里人和她自己的活思想，每隔两三天就换上一条语录，两年多来从未间断过。她从进初中起，就开始坚持学习毛主席著作，放学回家，经常学习《毛泽东选集》。无产阶级文化大革命的高潮开始以来，林小华反复学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的著作，她遵照毛主席的教导，积极地参加了学校和社会上的斗批改，成了文化大革命的一员小闯将。
    在革命家庭里成长起来的小华，从小就受到革命传统的熏陶。她父亲经常教育他们，要永远不忘阶级苦，坚持发扬老红军、老八路艰苦奋斗的优良作风。小华有一件从十岁穿到现在的小褂，两个袖子已经接了长长一截，上面补了十六七个补钉，全都是她一针一线缝起来的。每年，小华他们一家都要几次到野外去挖野菜吃。每当吃野菜，他们就怀念起红军、八路军，怀念起千千万万为人民解放事业而献身的革命英雄，更加热爱党，热爱领袖毛主席。
    文化部为了表扬林小华全家对毛主席对毛泽东思想的无限热爱，专门派人到林小华家，向他们全家赠送了《毛泽东选集》和《毛主席语录》等毛主席著作，并且经过说服解释，把小华送到文化部的一千一百元捐款退还给她家。这一天，小华和她的两个姊姊穿着他们父亲穿过的旧军装，佩戴着红卫兵袖章，热情地接待了文化部来的同志。她们表示，今后一定要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中把自己锻炼成坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
