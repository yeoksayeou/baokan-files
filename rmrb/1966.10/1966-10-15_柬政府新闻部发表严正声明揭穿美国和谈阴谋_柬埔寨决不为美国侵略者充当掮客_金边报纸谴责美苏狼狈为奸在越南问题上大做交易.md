The Cambodian government information department issued a solemn statement on October 13, pointing out that Cambodia rejects acting as an unscrupulous intermediary in the Vietnam issue that benefits U.S. aggressors.

The statement from the Cambodian information department was issued to refute a rumor spread by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs. The statement said: "According to a recent report from Manila by Agence France-Presse about the possibility of Indonesia mediating in the Vietnam conflict, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs pointed out on this issue, 'Other Asian countries, such as Cambodia, have already refused to act as honest intermediaries to try to open the way for negotiations with Hanoi.'"

The statement said: "The government information department of the Kingdom of Cambodia wants to clarify this issue: the more accurate statement should be: Cambodia has refused to act as an unscrupulous intermediary in the Vietnam issue."

The statement pointed out that although Cambodia sincerely hopes to see peace restored in its neighboring country of Vietnam, "it absolutely does not want to contribute to a peace that is unjust to the heroic Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting on their own soil against naked foreign aggression; this is a peace that, according to the conditions of the aggressors, serves the interests of the aggressors, and harms the victims."

The statement said: "Cambodia believes that if it were to try to open the way for 'negotiations with Hanoi,' it would only benefit the U.S. government—the U.S. government's position in Vietnam is undoubtedly that of an aggressor—and it would only benefit the Saigon authorities that are closely aligned with the U.S. government. To benefit the aggressors, in whatever way, is to act as a disreputable intermediary. Cambodia will not play such a role."

The Cambodian News Agency reported on October 14 that the Cambodian newspaper "Cambodia Telegraph" published an editorial on October 13 condemning Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's secret talks in Washington with U.S. President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk, accusing the Soviet Union of colluding with the United States.

The editorial said: "The more Washington expands the war in Asia, the more Moscow advocates peace and peaceful coexistence." The editorial pointed out that there is ample evidence that during the Gromyko-Johnson and Gromyko-Rusk talks, there was an atmosphere of "frankness and friendliness." "Whether on the banks of the Moscow River or the (Potomac River flowing through Washington), everyone is saying: 'The Soviet Union and the United States want to reach an understanding.'"

The editorial pointed out that as long as high-level officials of the Soviet Union and the United States "continue to have intimate conversations in the living room to ensure that the Vietnam conflict does not 'seriously affect the future of Soviet-U.S. relations,'" then the Soviet Union's "aid" to Vietnam is meaningless. The editorial also pointed out, "One cannot help but think of such a collusion: this is possibly a secret agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States behind the backs of the peoples of various countries fighting against U.S. imperialism."

    柬政府新闻部发表严正声明揭穿美国和谈阴谋
    柬埔寨决不为美国侵略者充当掮客
    金边报纸谴责美苏狼狈为奸在越南问题上大做交易
    新华社金边十三日电　柬埔寨王国政府新闻部十三日发表声明，指出柬埔寨拒绝在越南问题上充当有利于美国侵略者的不正直的中间人。
    柬埔寨新闻部的声明，是为了驳斥菲律宾外交部散布的一项谣言而发表的。声明说：“据法新社最近发自马尼拉的关于印度尼西亚可能在越南冲突中进行斡旋的消息说，菲律宾外交部就这个问题指出，‘其他一些亚洲国家，例如柬埔寨，已经拒绝充当正直的中间人来设法为同河内举行谈判开辟道路。’”
    声明说：“王国政府新闻部要就这个问题明确指出，更确切得多的说法应该是这样的：柬埔寨已经拒绝在越南问题上充当不正直的中间人。”
    声明指出，虽然柬埔寨热切希望看到在越南这个邻国恢复和平。但是“它绝不愿意有助于促成这样的和平：对于在自己的国土上为抗击赤裸裸的外国侵略而英勇地斗争的英雄的越南人民是不公正的和平；这是一种按照侵略者的条件，为侵略者的利益效劳，而损害受害者的和平。”
    声明说：“柬埔寨认为，由它来设法为‘同河内举行谈判开辟道路’，只会有利于美国政府——美国政府在越南所处的地位，毫无疑问是侵略者的地位——只会有利于紧紧依附美国政府的西贡当局。而有利于侵略者，不管其方式如何，只能是充当不光采的掮客。柬埔寨不充当这样的角色。”
    新华社金边十四日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》十三日就苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在华盛顿同美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克举行秘密会谈发表社论，谴责苏联同美国加紧勾结。
    社论说：“华盛顿越是在亚洲扩大战火，莫斯科就越是鼓吹和平与和平共处。”社论指出，有大量的事实证实葛罗米柯—约翰逊以及葛罗米柯—腊斯克会谈期间一直笼罩着“坦率和友好的”气氛。“无论是在莫斯科河边还是在（流经华盛顿的）波托马克河边，大家都在说：‘苏联和美国都想取得谅解。’”
    社论指出，只要苏美两国高级官员“还继续在客厅里亲密交谈以使越南冲突不致‘过于严重地影响苏美关系前途’”的时候，那么苏联对越南的“援助”都是没有意义的。社论还指出，“人们不能不想到这样一种狼狈为奸的阴谋：这就是可能正背着为反对美帝国主义而斗争的各国人民达成一项苏美秘密默契。”
