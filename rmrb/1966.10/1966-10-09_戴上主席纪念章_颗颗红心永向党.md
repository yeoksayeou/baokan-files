Recently, a lively scene has unfolded on the streets of Beijing: outside bookstores, supply and marketing cooperatives, and stationery shops, hundreds or even thousands of students from other provinces often gather, patiently waiting in line for the most precious souvenir—a Chairman Mao badge. Red Guards and revolutionary students who have purchased the badges gather in small groups, sharing their boundless joy.

This golden-edged, red-background, shining badge has captured the hearts of countless revolutionary youth!

Students from other provinces who come to Beijing to learn from the cultural revolution experience all share a common wish: to bring back the most meaningful gift from Beijing to their classmates who stayed behind. This most precious gift is the Chairman Mao badge.

Every day, countless letters filled with revolutionary passion and boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao fly from all corners of the country to Beijing, to the supply and marketing cooperatives, and to the factories producing the badges.

Some letters say: “Although we are far away from Beijing, our hearts are with Beijing, with our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. We are so eager to obtain the great leader Chairman Mao’s badge!” Others write: “No matter how many pens and sheets of paper we use, we cannot fully express our love for Chairman Mao; no matter how many words and nights we spend, we cannot fully express our belief in Mao Zedong Thought. We miss Chairman Mao, and we urgently need to wear Chairman Mao’s badge to be by his side at all times.” Some letters say: “Wearing the badge, we feel full of strength, our hearts forever loyal to the Party!”

The moving scenes of people rushing to buy badges on the streets and the letters expressing boundless love for Chairman Mao have inspired the workers.

In recent days, workers at the Red Flag Badge Factory have been working day and night in the workshop to complete the production tasks quickly, efficiently, and economically. They say: “Producing Chairman Mao badges is a serious political task, a task of great political significance. Every badge produced adds strength to the cultural revolution.”

Workers in the stamping department of this factory use magnifying glasses to inspect the badges, ensuring that every badge leaving the factory is flawless. Workers in the painting department repeatedly study “Qu Yuan Moves Mountains,” continuously improving their painting techniques and increasing efficiency. Workers in the oxidation department are so meticulous that if anything does not meet the standard, they cannot eat or sleep well. Once, worker Li Hongchun was working with acid water, but due to insufficient acidity, the plating was not done well, and the badge did not shine brightly. During his break, he immediately studied “In Memory of Norman Bethune,” reflecting on his lack of responsibility. He said: “Without Chairman Mao, how could we have today? I must make the badge better and better.”

    戴上主席纪念章　颗颗红心永向党
    最近以来的北京街头，有一个引人注目的生动景象：一些书店、供销社、文具商店门口，常常拥挤着成百上千的外地学生。他们排着队，在那里耐心等候，等候一件最珍贵的纪念品——毛主席纪念章。买到纪念章的红卫兵和革命学生，三三两两聚拢在一起，彼此倾谈着无限喜悦的心情。
    这枚金边红地、闪闪发光的纪念章啊，你吸引了多少万革命青少年的心！
    外地来京的革命同学，在学习北京文化大革命的经验的同时，都怀着一个心愿，要把北京最有纪念意义的礼物，带回去送给留校同学。这最珍贵的礼物就是毛主席纪念章。
    每天，多少封充满着革命激情，充满着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的书信，从祖国的四面八方飞向北京，飞向供销店，飞向制造纪念章的工厂。
    有的信上说：“我们虽然身在离北京遥远的地方，可是，我们的心向着北京，向着我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。我们多么迫切需要得到伟大领袖毛主席的纪念章啊！……”有的这样写着：“无数支笔，无数张纸，都表达不尽我们对毛主席的热爱；千言万语，几天几夜，也讲不完我们对毛泽东思想的信仰。我们想念毛主席，我们迫切需要佩戴毛主席纪念章，让我们时时刻刻在毛主席的身边。”有的信上说：“戴上纪念章，浑身有力量，红心永向党！”
    街头出现的争购纪念章的动人场面，封封书信所表达的对毛主席无限热爱的心情，激励着职工们。
    这些天来，红旗证章厂的工人，为了多快好省地完成生产任务，日夜不离车间。他们说：“生产毛主席纪念章，是一项严肃的政治任务，是一项具有伟大政治意义的战斗任务。多生产一枚纪念章，就多给文化大革命增添一分力量。”
    这个工厂冲压组的工人为了保证毛主席纪念章的质量，经常用放大镜来检查，做到每一枚出厂的纪念章都完好无损。描漆组工人一遍又一遍地学习《愚公移山》，不断改进描绘技术，提高工效。氧化组的同志们，在操作过程中，有一点不合标准，就连饭也吃不香，觉也睡不着。一次，工人李洪春正在酸水里做镪活，由于酸水的药性不足，镪活没干好，纪念章显得不够亮。下班休息时，他马上学习《纪念白求恩》，联系自己责任心不强作了检查。他说：“没有毛主席，那能有今天？我要把纪念章做得好上加好。”
