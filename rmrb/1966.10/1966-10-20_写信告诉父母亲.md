Write a letter to inform parents,
In Beijing, I have seen relatives.
The rising sun illuminates the city,
Chairman Mao has come to see us.

Write a letter to inform parents,
The Chairman smiled at me warmly,
My blood boils with excitement, my heart is warm,
A thousand words turn into cheers of “Long live!”

Write a letter to inform parents,
The Chairman’s words are forever in my heart,
I will manage state affairs,
I will never forget the revolution in my life.

Write a letter to inform parents,
The Cultural Revolution is leading the charge,
I dare to brave the knife mountain and fire sea,
I will charge through the stormy winds and waves.

Write a letter to inform parents,
I have a red heart for the people,
Like the pine tree standing tall against the cold,
I vow to be a revolutionary successor!

    写信告诉父母亲
    写信告诉父母亲，北京城里见亲人，
    东升太阳照满城，毛主席来看我们。
    写信告诉父母亲，主席对我笑盈盈，
    热血沸腾心儿暖，万语化作“万岁”声。
    写信告诉父母亲，主席话儿永记心，
    国家大事我要管，革命一生不忘本。
    写信告诉父母亲，文化革命打头阵，
    刀山火海我敢闯，狂风恶浪我要冲。
    写信告诉父母亲，一颗红心为人民，
    苍松劲挺不畏寒，誓作革命接班人！
