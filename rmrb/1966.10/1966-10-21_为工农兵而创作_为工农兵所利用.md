In the deepening and developing Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat, amateur art warriors from Daqing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and other places, as well as the Inner Mongolia Ulanqab Performing Troupe, the Guangzhou Military District's Sea Culture Work Team, and the innovative Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe, have all come to Beijing with a fighting spirit, bringing the bountiful harvest of the Cultural Revolution to report their performances to Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses of the capital. They have been warmly received by the audience. Whenever the performance ends, the performers and the audience gather together, celebrating the victory of the Cultural Revolution. Many audience members give their beloved Chairman Mao badges to the performers, shouting in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and singing enthusiastically, "The East Is Red." This moving scene is unprecedented. Thousands of enthusiastic letters from the audience praise: "The art of workers, peasants, and soldiers is excellent!"

Singing Praises to the Red Sun in Our Hearts, Singing Praises to Great Mao Zedong Thought

In a massive choral performance, the most resonant and melodious song is the praise song for our great leader Chairman Mao. The workers, peasants, and soldiers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts, the brightest eyes, the firmest stance, and the clearest love and hate. They say: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. When we think of Chairman Mao, we have a thousand poems in our hearts, and when we think of Chairman Mao, we have ten thousand songs on our lips." The large-scale poetry chorus "Dear Chairman Mao, You Are the Red Sun in Our Hearts," the couplet "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," the solo "The Daur People Listen Most to Chairman Mao's Words," and the song and dance "The Little Red Book Is Given to Us" — every performance is filled with deep affection for Chairman Mao, vividly expressing the boundless admiration and love of the broad masses of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers for Chairman Mao; expressing the resolve of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

Singing praises to Chairman Mao is the voice from their hearts. Li Yuzheng, a member of the Hebei Provincial Farmers' Amateur Performance Troupe, becomes emotional and tears up when talking about Chairman Mao. He says: "Every time I perform 'The Little Red Book Is Given to Us,' I am very moved and naturally recall the excitement when the village party branch gave me the Little Red Book. At that time, I held the golden book I had longed for in both hands, laughing in my heart and shedding tears of happiness. Every performance makes me relive the happiness of receiving the Little Red Book." He Dezhi, a 42-year-old member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Amateur Performance Troupe, says: "When I was 12, I herded cattle for the landlord, living a life worse than cattle. In the cold winter, I went barefoot up the mountain to herd cattle, freezing like being pierced by needles. There was no way, so I warmed my feet by stepping on cow dung. Like this, when one pile of cow dung got cold, I changed to another pile, eagerly watching the east, waiting for the red sun to rise. Chairman Mao is my savior. How can I not sing praises to Chairman Mao! We will sing praises to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, for generations to come."

Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the fundamental reason for the revolutionary people to rebel and make a revolution. Its brilliance illuminates the path forward for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. With it, we have everything. Singing praises to Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, is the fundamental task, glorious mission, and eternal theme of revolutionary art. In this reporting performance, the red thread of Mao Zedong Thought runs through every evening performance and every program. The performances by the Daqing Oilfield Workers and Family Members' Amateur Performance Troupe, "The Daqing Workers Report Victory" and "The Daqing Workers' Families Report Victory," are triumphant reports of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Can acrobatics highlight politics and propagate Mao Zedong Thought? The Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe's performance gives a positive answer: Yes! During the Cultural Revolution, they criticized bourgeois authorities, advocated daring to think and dare to venture, and created many new acrobatics reflecting the fiery struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, such as "Celebrating the Harvest," "Air Force Training," "Exercising After Work," and "Red Salesgirl." The ancient frameworks were smashed, and the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought was raised on the acrobatics stage. Although their performances still have some flaws, the direction is correct. We believe that since they dare to innovate and take the first solid and precious step, they will definitely create socialist new acrobatics that unify high political content with perfect artistic form.

Singing Praises to the Heroic Figures of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Armed with Mao Zedong Thought

The workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, are engaged in the great task of thoroughly criticizing the old world and establishing a new world. In this struggle to change heaven and earth, they have written the most magnificent poems of humanity with their own hands and composed the newest and most beautiful heroic symphonies with their revolutionary passion. Portraying them and singing praises to them is the duty of revolutionary art workers.

This amateur performance by workers, peasants, and soldiers is truly a stage full of heroes and a chorus of victory songs. The song and dance "Praising Wang Jinxi," the chorus "Being a Good Soldier of Chairman Mao," the female vocal performance "The Song of Liu Yingjun," and the performances depicting collective heroic deeds such as "The People of Dangpu Change Heaven and Earth" and "The Sun Shines on Shashi Yu" — all with high-spirited tunes and fervent emotions, expressing the broad revolutionary masses' praise for these heroic figures, heroic collectives, and heroic deeds.

The power of examples is boundless. From the diaries of some new heroic figures, one can see how much strength they have drawn from the predecessors' heroic figures! Why do these heroic figures have such great power? In these performances, it is vividly and vividly revealed: Why can Wang Jinxi, in such a difficult place and under such difficult conditions, dare to take on heavy responsibilities, face difficulties head-on, and create astonishing miracles? What are the 32111 Oil Drilling Team thinking about when they climb mountains and cross rivers without tiring, go to the ends of the earth without turning back, know there are tigers in the mountains but still go to the tiger mountain, know fire burns people but still rush into the fire sea? What is Wang Jie thinking when he uses his life to save twelve class brothers? What is Mai Xiande thinking when he writes a heroic and magnificent victory song with his blood? Every action, every invention, every creation, and every victory of theirs shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Every step they take forward is the result of Mao Zedong Thought guiding them.

Learning from heroic figures is to study Chairman Mao's works in the struggle; singing praises to heroic figures is to sing praises to Mao Zedong Thought through heroic figures. Every heroic praise song they sing is a praise song to Mao Zedong Thought.

Write the Center, Perform the Center, Excellent!

Holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following the revolutionary tasks of the Party in each period, serving proletarian politics, is the common characteristic of this workers, peasants, and soldiers' art performance. Workers, peasants, and soldiers' art is the product of the three great revolutionary struggles. Every program and every performance of the amateur art warriors of workers, peasants, and soldiers are responses to the Party's calls and adaptations to the needs of the revolution. They have always regarded writing the center and performing the center as the most realistic and urgent tasks of revolutionary art.

In this great Cultural Revolution, singing "The Sixteen Points," praising the revolutionary little generals Red Guards, exposing the ugly faces and evil plots of ghosts and snakes, and singing praises to the great significance and great victory of the Cultural Revolution, is a common theme of this performance. The chorus "The War Drum of the Cultural Revolution" performed by the Hebei Provincial Farmers' Amateur Performance Troupe was warmly received by the audience. The performers' class feelings are very rich. The drummer is a young girl, radiant and full of spirit, drumming with great energy and pride. Two drumsticks in her hands are like two hand grenades, and with one beat, she wants to smash the ghosts and snakes to pieces. She said: "When I practiced drumming, I beat my thighs with two fists, and old grudges and new hatreds surged up in my heart. The more I beat, the more strength I had, and I beat my legs until they were swollen." The "Drum Group" performed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Amateur Performance Troupe is new in form and grand in spirit: four tall and large red war drums are lined up in the middle of the stage, and four cultural revolution pioneers stand tall and handsome. The giant drums roar, shaking the heavens and the earth. The class enemies hear it and lose their souls; the revolutionaries hear it and are greatly encouraged, greatly inspired, and greatly motivated, standing tall and proud. Worker Xu Changtian from the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant said: "I watched it and was happy from the bottom of my heart. My fists were clenched tightly, and I wanted to smash those anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to pieces, smash the entire old world to pieces."

Writing the center and performing the center is to timely propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, guidelines, and lines according to the Party's combat tasks in each period; writing the center and performing the center is the urgent requirement of the three great revolutionary struggles; writing the center and performing the center is excellent!

Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Advancing in the Direction of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Whether one is willing or not to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers is a matter of class stance. Whether one can serve well or not is first a matter of class feelings.

Why are the works and performances of amateur art warriors of workers, peasants, and soldiers so popular with the masses? Because they love Chairman Mao the most and admire Mao Zedong Thought the most; because they are practitioners of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and they understand the aspirations and voices of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers the best. They have truly achieved "creating for workers, peasants, and soldiers and letting them use it." Their performances are the most vivid and practical, with the strongest revolutionary and fighting spirit. Those who have watched "Grip the Gun in Your Hand" cannot help but be infected by that magnificent spirit and fiery fighting passion. Every line of dialogue and every action are filled with hatred for class enemies, fully expressing the high spirits and confidence in victory of the Chinese militia armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Those who have watched the performances by the Daqing Oilfield Workers and Family Members' Amateur Performance Troupe praising Daqing, who does not cheer for heroic Daqing, who does not take pride in heroic Daqing!

Professional art workers, in order to make their creations and performances popular with the masses, must go to workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time and unconditionally, go to the fiery struggles of the masses, and change and transform their feelings. The Ulanqab Performing Troupe did this and achieved results; the Guangzhou Military District's Sea Culture Work Team did this and was warmly welcomed by the masses. Wherever they go, they put familiarizing themselves with workers, peasants, and soldiers and learning from them first. They not only perform for the masses, show movies, and project slides, but also labor and fight with workers, peasants, and soldiers, help them organize clubs, and cultivate workers, peasants, and soldiers' art cadres. The Guangzhou Military District's Sea Culture Work Team, in more than a year, traveled through the Wan Shan Islands, wholeheartedly serving the soldiers. Before and after the performances, they also used their spare time to mend the soldiers' uniforms. The soldiers excitedly said: "You have learned 'Serve the People,' and you wholeheartedly serve the people. You mended not just a few patches for us, but the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity. Every stitch and every thread are filled with the Party's care and class feelings. Wearing the uniforms you mended, poisonous winds and sweet-talking shells cannot penetrate, and sugar-coated bullets cannot knock us down." The art warriors deeply feel: Only by going to workers, peasants, and soldiers, going to the fiery struggles of the masses, studying Chairman Mao's works in the three great revolutionary struggles, learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and completely breaking with all old traditions, can one become a faithful spokesman for the masses, and the work will be meaningful.

The unprecedented Cultural Revolution has pushed the revolutionary art of workers, peasants, and soldiers to a new historical stage. Workers, peasants, and soldiers' art has never been as brilliant as it is today. We must carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly criticize bourgeois old thoughts and old cultures, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionist art thought represented by Zhou Yang. We must have great aspirations, climb high peaks, advance in the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, innovate socialism, establish proletarian uniqueness, and create more brilliant socialist new art.

    为工农兵而创作　为工农兵所利用
    艺兵
    在无产阶级文化大革命日益深入发展的今天，大庆、河北、黑龙江等地的工农兵业余文艺战士，和长期活跃在三大革命斗争第一线的内蒙古乌兰牧骑演出队、广州部队海上文化工作队以及勇于革新的武汉市杂技团，以战斗的姿态，带着无产阶级文化大革命的丰收硕果来到北京，向毛主席和首都革命群众汇报演出，受到观众的热烈欢迎。每当演出结束，演员和观众就围拢在一起，共祝无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，许多观众把自己心爱的毛主席像纪念章给演员戴在胸上，齐声欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”纵情高歌《大海航行靠舵手》。这种动人的情景是前所未有的。千百封热情洋溢的观众来信赞扬说：工农兵文艺好得很！
    歌颂我们心中的红太阳，歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想
    在一组规模巨大的“大合唱”中，最响亮最动听的歌，是歌唱我们伟大领袖毛主席的颂歌。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵业余文艺战士，心最红、眼最亮、立场最坚定、爱憎最分明，对毛主席的感情比山高、比海深。他们说：毛主席，是亿万人民心中的红太阳，“想起毛主席，我们心中有千首诗，想起毛主席，我们嘴边有万支歌”。大型诗歌联唱《敬爱的毛主席，您是我们心中的红太阳》，对口词《毛泽东思想万岁》，独唱《达斡尔族人民最听毛主席的话》，歌舞《毛主席语录发给咱》等，每一个节目都灌注着对毛主席的无比深厚的感情，生动地表达了广大工农兵革命群众对毛主席的无限敬仰与无限热爱；表达了亿万工农兵群众永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，把社会主义革命进行到底的决心。
    歌颂毛主席，是发自他们心底的声音。河北省农民业余演出队的队员李玉璋，一谈起毛主席就激动得热泪盈眶，他说：“我每次演《毛主席语录发给咱》时都非常激动，很自然地回忆起在村里党支部发给我《毛主席语录》时的激动心情。当时，我双手捧着我久所盼望的金光闪闪的宝书，心里在笑，两眼流出了幸福的眼泪。每演一次都使我重享一次领受《毛主席语录》的幸福。”黑龙江省工农兵业余演出队达斡尔族四十二岁的社员何德志说：“我十二岁上就给地主放牛，过着人不如牛的生活。十冬腊月，赤着脚上山放牛，冻得像针穿似的，没办法，就两脚踩在牛粪上取暖。这样，一摊牛粪凉了，再换一摊，眼巴巴地望着东方，等着红太阳出来。毛主席是我的救命恩人，我怎么不歌唱毛主席！我们要世世代代歌唱我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。”
    毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是革命人民闹翻身干革命的根本。它的光辉照亮了中国人民和世界革命人民的前进的道路。有了它，就有了一切。歌颂毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，是革命文艺的根本任务、光荣的使命、永恒的主题。在这次汇报演出中，毛泽东思想的红线，贯穿在每个晚会、每个节目当中。大庆油田工人、家属业余演出队演出的《大庆职工报捷》和《大庆职工家属报捷》，就是伟大毛泽东思想的胜利捷报。
    杂技这门艺术能不能突出政治，宣传毛泽东思想？武汉市杂技团的演出作了肯定的回答：能！他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，批判了资产阶级权威，发扬了敢想、敢闯的革命精神，创编出《庆丰收》《空军锻炼》《工余练武》和《红色售货员》等许多反映工农兵火热斗争生活的新杂技。千年的老框框砸碎了，毛泽东思想伟大红旗插到了杂技这块阵地上。他们的节目尽管还存在着一些缺点，但方向是正确的。我们相信，他们既然敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，迈出了踏实可贵的第一步，就一定能创造高度的政治内容与完美的艺术形式相统一的社会主义新杂技来。
    歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄人物
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，在毛主席的英明领导下，正在从事着彻底批判旧世界，创立新世界的伟大创举。在这个改天换地的斗争中，他们用自己的双手写下了人间最壮丽的诗篇，用他们的革命豪情谱出了最新最美的英雄乐章。表现他们，歌颂他们，是革命文艺工作者义不容辞的责任。
    这次工农兵业余演出真是英雄满台，凯歌盈耳。歌舞《歌颂王铁人》，联唱《做毛主席的好战士》，女声表演唱《刘英俊之歌》以及表现集体英雄业绩的《当铺地人民改天换地》、《阳光照红了沙石峪》等节目，都以高昂的调子，炽烈的感情，倾诉了广大革命群众对这些英雄人物、英雄集体和英雄业绩的赞颂。
    榜样的力量是无穷的。从一些新的英雄人物的日记里可以看到，他们的成长，从前辈英雄人物身上吸取了多么大的力量啊！英雄人物为什么有这么大的力量呢？在这些节目中作了生动、形象的揭示：王铁人所以能够在那样困难的地方、困难的条件下，敢于承担重担，迎着困难上，创造出惊人的奇迹，靠的是什么？32111石油钻井队为给祖国找油找气，爬山涉水脚不软，天涯海角不回头，明知山有虎，偏向虎山行，明知火烧人，偏向火海冲，他们想的是什么？王杰用生命保住了十二个阶级弟兄，麦贤得用鲜血写出了英雄壮丽的凯歌，为的是什么？他们每一个行动，他们每一个发明，每一个创造，每一个胜利，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。他们每前进一步，都是毛泽东思想指引的结果。
    学习英雄人物，就是从斗争中活学活用毛主席著作；歌颂英雄人物，就是要通过英雄人物来歌颂毛泽东思想。他们演唱的每一支英雄的颂歌，就是一曲毛泽东思想的颂歌。
    写中心，演中心，好得很！
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧密配合党在各个时期内的革命任务，为无产阶级政治服务，是这次工农兵文艺演出的共同特征。工农兵文艺都是三大革命斗争的产物，工农兵业余文艺战士的每一个节目，每一次演出，都是响应党的号召、适应革命的需要而创作的。他们一向把写中心、演中心看成是革命文艺的最现实、最迫切的任务。
    在这次轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，歌唱“十六条”，歌颂革命的小闯将红卫兵，揭露牛鬼蛇神的丑恶嘴脸和罪恶阴谋，歌颂无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义与伟大胜利，是这次演出的一个共同的主题。河北省农民业余演出队演出的联唱《文化革命的战鼓》，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。演员们阶级感情非常充沛。擂鼓手是个年轻的姑娘，满面红光，神采奕奕，擂起鼓来，神气得很，自豪得很。两个鼓槌在她手中像两颗手榴弹一样，一槌下去，恨不得把牛鬼蛇神一下打它个粉身碎骨。她说：“我练打鼓时，用两个拳头往大腿上打，旧恨新仇涌上心头，越打越有劲，把两腿都打肿了。”黑龙江省工农兵业余演出队演出的“锣鼓群”这个节目，形式新，气势大：四座又高又大的红色战鼓并排在舞台中间，四员文化革命的闯将飒爽英姿，巨鼓齐鸣，惊天动地。阶级敌人闻之丧魂落魄；革命者听了大长志气，大添精神，大鼓干劲，扬眉吐气。北京汽车制造厂工人许长田说：“我看了打心里高兴，拳头攥得紧紧的，恨不得一拳把那些反党反社会主义分子砸它个稀巴烂，把整个旧世界砸它个稀巴烂。”
    写中心，演中心，就是根据党在各个时期的战斗任务，及时地宣传毛泽东思想和党的方针路线政策；写中心，演中心，是三大革命斗争的迫切要求；写中心，演中心，好得很！
    为工农兵服务，沿着工农兵方向前进
    愿意不愿意为工农兵服务，是一个阶级立场问题。能不能服务得好，首先是阶级感情问题。
    工农兵业余文艺战士的作品和演出为什么那样受群众欢迎，因为他们最热爱毛主席，最崇拜毛泽东思想；因为他们是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实践者，最了解工农兵群众的愿望和呼声。他们真正做到了“为工农兵所创作，为工农兵所利用”。他们的演出最生动、最实际，革命性和战斗性最强。看过《紧握手中枪》的观众，谁也不能不为那种雄壮的气魄和火一样的战斗激情所感染，它的每一句台词，每一个动作都充满对阶级敌人的仇恨，充分表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国民兵那种昂扬斗志和必胜的信心。看过大庆油田工人、家属业余演出队歌颂大庆的节目，谁不为英雄的大庆欢呼，谁不为英雄的大庆骄傲！
    专业文艺工作者，要想使自己的创作和演出为群众所欢迎，就必须长期地无条件地到工农兵中去，到群众的火热斗争中去，使自己的感情来一个变化，来一番改造。乌兰牧骑这样做了，就做出了成绩；广州部队海上文化工作队这样做了，就大受群众欢迎。他们无论到那里，都把熟悉工农兵，学习工农兵放在第一位。他们除了为群众演出，放电影，放幻灯，还跟工农兵一起劳动战斗，帮助他们整顿俱乐部，培养工农兵文艺骨干。广州部队海上文化工作队，在一年多的时间里，走遍了万山群岛，全心全意地为战士服务。在演出前后，他们还利用空余时间为战士补军衣，战士激动地说：“你们学习了《为人民服务》，就全心全意为人民服务，你们给我们补的不只是几个补钉，而是艰苦朴素的光荣传统，这一针针、一线线，都带着党的关怀和阶级感情，穿上你们补的军衣，香风毒气攻不透，糖衣炮弹打不倒。”文艺战士们深深体会到：只有到工农兵中去，到群众的火热斗争中去，在三大革命斗争过程中，活学活用毛主席著作，学习工农兵，与一切旧的传统观念实行彻底决裂，才能成为群众的忠实代言人，工作才有意义。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把工农兵革命文艺推向了一个崭新的历史阶段。工农兵文艺从来都没有像今天这样光辉灿烂。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底批判资产阶级旧思想、旧文化，彻底肃清以周扬为代表的修正主义文艺思想的流毒。我们要树雄心，攀高峰，沿着工农兵方向前进，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，创造出更加灿烂的社会主义新文艺。（附图片）
