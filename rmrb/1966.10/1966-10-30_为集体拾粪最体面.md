Last May, our production brigade decided to assign three members to collect manure to reduce production costs. The brigade held a meeting to mobilize volunteers. At that time, I thought that other farm work could be done, but collecting manure was a "lowly" job. It was suitable for children and old men to do, but it would be too undignified for a young intellectual like me. In the future, it would be hard to find a partner! During the meeting, I remained silent from beginning to end.

Back at home, I couldn't sleep all night, thinking over and over: I have studied the essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune," but have I really put it into practice? Where should I apply it? Comrade Zhang Side was an old revolutionary who had gone through the Long March. The Party assigned him to make charcoal, and for the needs of the revolution, he willingly went to the most difficult places, even sacrificing his precious life. Compared to Comrade Zhang Side, I am far behind. In revolutionary work, is there any distinction between high and low? Is there any difference between dignified and undignified? Serving the people is the most honorable thing.

After a night of struggle, I finally overcame my bourgeois thoughts and decided to take up the hoe for the revolution.

The next morning, as soon as it was light, I ran to the brigade leader's house and requested to go collect manure. The brigade leader asked me, "Can you stick it out?" I firmly replied, "By constantly reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words, I can stick it out."

Following my lead, two other brigade members also volunteered to collect manure.

Over the past year, I have been getting up early and carrying the hoe, walking through various villages, and collecting over four hundred loads of manure for the collective. The brigade has increased its manure supply, and I have also tempered my thoughts.

    为集体拾粪最体面
    去年五月间，我们生产队为了降低生产成本，决定安排三个社员去拾粪。队里召开社员大会，动员自愿报名。当时我想，其他农活可做，拾粪是件“下贱”活，小孩、老头干这种活还合适，知识青年去干太不体面，今后连对象都难找哩！我在会上，自始至终不言不语。
    回到家里，我一夜睡不着觉，想了又想：我学过《为人民服务》这篇文章，究竟有没有用，要用到哪里去呢？张思德同志是一个经过长征的老战士，党叫他烧木炭就烧木炭，为了革命工作的需要，自愿到最艰苦的地方去，甚至献出了宝贵的生命。比起张思德同志，我差得太远了。革命工作还有什么贵贱之分、还有什么体面不体面呢？为人民服务才是最体面的。
    经过一夜思想斗争，我终于战胜了资产阶级思想，下决心为革命拿畚箕。
    第二天天刚亮，我就跑到队长家中，向队长要求去拾粪。队长问我：“你能坚持到底吗？”我坚决回答：“经常读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，我就能坚持到底。”
    在我的带动下，还有两位社员也报名参加拾粪。
    一年来，我起早摸黑挑着畚箕，走遍各村，为集体拾了四百多担粪肥。生产队增加了粪肥，我自己也炼红了思想。
