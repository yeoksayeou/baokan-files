The number one war criminal in the massacre of the Vietnamese people, Johnson, traveled thousands of miles to Asia to convene a so-called "Seven-Nation Summit." The joint communiqué of the meeting, on the one hand, shouted about continuing the war of aggression in Vietnam, saying, "for as long as necessary"; on the other hand, it raised the banner of "pursuing peace" and "achieving reconciliation." This is a meeting that plays with a new "peace talk" trick, a meeting of "using war to force peace," and a meeting that plots to expand the war of aggression.

The American aggressors and their accomplices, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, are now talking about "peace" and "reconciliation." Isn't this a bit ridiculous? Look at the joint communiqué issued by the Manila meeting, and you will know that they are trying to use the so-called "pursuit of peace" and "achievement of reconciliation" to obtain what they cannot get on the battlefield.

The Manila meeting's joint communiqué, on the issue of "peace talks," has played a new card, saying that "when the other side withdraws its troops to the north and stops infiltration, thereby reducing the level of violence," the U.S. aggressor forces and their accomplice forces will "not be delayed for more than six months" to withdraw. Does the United States really want to lay down its butcher's knife, stop the aggression, and roll out of Vietnam? Absolutely not. The so-called "withdrawal within six months" plan is a complete hoax.

The U.S. imperialists say that withdrawal is possible, but there are conditions. What conditions? One is called "reducing the level of violence," which means that the people of South Vietnam should stop armed struggle under the gunpoint of the 300,000 U.S. aggressor troops. Another is called "the other side withdrawing its troops to the north and stopping infiltration," which means that the people of North Vietnam should abandon their support for their compatriots in the south and abandon their sacred struggle of anti-American national salvation. In a word, it is to make the 31 million Vietnamese people surrender to the counter-revolutionary violence of U.S. imperialism and fully capitulate. The U.S. imperialists and their accomplices have expended tremendous effort, fought for several years, and wanted to conquer Vietnam, but they were beaten by the Vietnamese people to the point of being disheveled and disgraced. The U.S. imperialists are the losers on the Vietnam battlefield, and now they dare to act like conquerors, demanding that the heroic Vietnamese people sign a "capitulation agreement" with them. This is extremely arrogant and laughable!

For many years, the Vietnamese people have fought bravely, one after another, to strive for the complete unification and thorough liberation of their motherland. To make the Vietnamese people accept the humiliating conditions proposed by the Manila meeting is to make the Vietnamese people abandon the victory fruits of their anti-war struggle for more than twenty years. Isn't this to make the Vietnamese people become slaves of the American colony? This is absolutely impossible.

The U.S. imperialists are the aggressors, and the Vietnamese people are the victims of aggression. The United States sent more than 300,000 troops to invade Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people are resisting the invasion on their own land. This is an ironclad fact that no one can reverse. The aggressors should roll out of Vietnam, which is only natural. If the United States really wants to withdraw its troops, it should withdraw unconditionally, and there is no need to talk about any prior conditions; it should withdraw immediately and completely, and there is no need for six months. In fact, six days would be enough. The Manila meeting's joint communiqué, with thousands of words, boils down to one sentence: the U.S. aggressors do not want to withdraw their troops and want to stay in South Vietnam.

In the Manila meeting's joint communiqué, there is also a dark saying: "When the aggression stops," South Vietnam will achieve "reconciliation of all members of society." What does this mean? In short, first, the people of South Vietnam lay down their weapons; then, they can be given a few official positions in the U.S. puppet government; finally, on a certain morning, they will be killed. In the history of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, haven't the imperialists and reactionaries performed this treacherous and vicious counter-revolutionary trick enough times? The bloody lessons left in this regard are already more than enough!

Chairman Mao said: "The principle of the reactionary forces towards the people's democratic forces is to eliminate them if they can be eliminated, and to prepare to eliminate them in the future if they cannot be eliminated temporarily." The principle of U.S. imperialism towards the Vietnamese people's revolutionary forces must also be this, and it will not deviate from this principle.

The Manila meeting is also a meeting that plots to expand the war of aggression. Before the meeting, McNamara went to Saigon to make military deployments. After the meeting, Johnson went to South Vietnam to boost the morale of the U.S. aggressor troops. The U.S. military leaders in Vietnam shouted at the Manila meeting that they would send more U.S. aggressor troops and accomplice troops to Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists are playing "using war to force peace." If this scheme fails, they will prepare to fight a big war. Therefore, the "pursuit of peace" tune sung at the Manila meeting is actually the prelude to the further expansion of the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression.

The Manila meeting's joint communiqué is not the sole creation of the United States. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is also involved, as are the various followers of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The secret talks between Gromyko and Johnson in the White House, the Soviet leadership clique and its followers' frenzied activities inside and outside the United Nations, as well as the running around of the Indian reactionaries and the Tito clique, are all parts of this "using war to force peace" grand conspiracy. To smash the U.S. imperialists' grand conspiracy and defend the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people and all the people of the world, it is also necessary to thoroughly expose the betrayal activities of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and wage an irreconcilable struggle against this gang of shameless traitors.

The core of the current Vietnam issue is the issue of the immediate and complete withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Vietnam. Any "peace talks" and "mediation" that do not demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of the United States are serving the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression and war. This is a major issue of right and wrong, a principle that cannot be compromised. If this principle is violated, it will not only harm the interests of the Vietnamese people but also harm the interests of all the people of the world. Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia is right: "The only way to end the Vietnam conflict is to demand that the Americans withdraw from Vietnam," "which does not require negotiations and mediation."

The Vietnamese people are a great people who stand tall and firm. They have achieved brilliant victories in their great struggle of anti-American national salvation. They have repeatedly exposed and smashed the various tricks and schemes of the U.S. imperialists and their followers. Such a people are invincible. Chairman Ho Chi Minh recently issued a solemn call to all Vietnamese people: "The Vietnamese people must unite as one, endure hardships, and make sacrifices to defeat the American aggressor bandits"; "The enemy will definitely fail, and the Vietnamese people will definitely win." Undoubtedly, the 31 million Vietnamese people will, under this battle call, overcome all difficulties and march forward bravely towards the final victory of the anti-American national salvation struggle!

    评战争罪犯“谋求和平”
    观察家
    屠杀越南人民的第一号战争罪犯约翰逊，不远万里，来到亚洲，召集了一个所谓“七国首脑会议”。会议的联合公报，一面叫嚷要把侵越战争打下去，“需要多久就多久”；一面打出所谓“谋求和平”、“实行和解”的旗号。这是一个玩弄“和谈”新骗局、“以战迫和”的会议，是一个策划扩大侵略战争的会议。
    双手沾满越南人民鲜血的美国侵略强盗及其帮凶，现在怎么大讲“和平”、“和解”呢？这岂不有点滑稽吗？看一看马尼拉会议发表的联合公报，人们就可以知道，他们是企图通过所谓“谋求和平”、“实行和解”，来取得他们在战场上所得不到的东西。
    马尼拉会议联合公报，在“和谈”问题上，打出了一张新的牌，说什么“在另一方把它的军队撤退到北方、停止渗入，从而暴力程度消减时”，美国侵略军及其帮凶军将“不迟于六个月内撤走”。美国作出这样一副姿态，难道真的是要放下屠刀，停止侵略，从越南滚出去吗？绝对不是。所谓“六个月内撤军”的方案，完全是大骗局。
    美帝国主义说，撤军是可以的，但是要有条件。什么条件呢？一个叫做：“消减”“暴力程度”，这就是要越南南方人民在美国三十几万侵略军的枪口下，停止武装斗争。再一个叫做：“另一方把它的军队撤退到北方、停止渗入”，这就是要越南北方的人民放弃对他们南方同胞的支援，放弃他们抗美救国的神圣斗争。一句话，就是要三千一百万越南人民向美帝国主义的反革命暴力屈服，全面投降。美帝国主义及其帮凶，费了九牛二虎之力，打了几年仗，想要征服越南，结果却被越南人民打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。美帝国主义是越南战场上的失败者，现在居然以征服者的姿态，要英雄的越南人民同它订“城下之盟”，这真是狂妄之极，可笑之极！
    越南人民多少年来，前赴后继，英勇战斗，就是为了争取祖国的完全统一和彻底解放。要越南人民接受马尼拉会议提出的这种屈辱的条件，岂不是等于要越南人民把二十多年来浴血抗战的胜利成果付诸东流吗？岂不是要越南人民沦为美国殖民地的奴隶吗？这是一万个办不到的。
    美帝国主义是侵略者，越南人民是被侵略者。美国派了三十几万军队侵入越南，越南人民是在自己祖国的土地上抵抗侵略。这是任何人也颠倒不了的铁的事实。侵略者应当从越南滚出去，这是天经地义。如果美国真的要撤军，它就应当无条件地撤，而根本谈不到什么先决条件；它就应当立即全部撤，根本不需要六个月。其实，六天就完全足够了。马尼拉会议的联合公报洋洋数千言，说来说去还是那句话：美国侵略者是不想撤军的，是要赖在南越不走的。
    马尼拉会议的联合公报中，还有一句黑话：“当侵略停止了的时候”，南越将实现“社会全体成员的和解”。这句话是什么意思呢？说穿了，就是：首先，南越人民放下武器；然后，在美伪控制的政权中，可以给你几个官做；最后在某一个早晨，就要杀你的头。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的历史上，帝国主义和反动派所表演的这一套阴险毒辣的反革命把戏，难道还少吗？在这方面留下的血的教训，已经够多的了！
    毛主席说：“反动势力对于人民的民主势力的原则，是能够消灭者一定消灭之，暂时不能消灭者准备将来消灭之。”美帝国主义对于越南人民革命力量的原则，也必然是这样，而绝不会违背这个原则。
    马尼拉会议，也是一个策划扩大侵略战争的会议。在会议之前，麦克纳马拉到西贡去进行了军事部署。在会议之后，约翰逊又到南越，为美国侵略军打气。侵越美军头目在马尼拉会议上叫嚷，要派更多的美国侵略军和帮凶军到越南去。美帝国主义搞的是“以战迫和”。此计若不成，它就准备大打。因此，马尼拉会议所唱的“谋求和平”的调子，实际上是美帝国主义进一步扩大侵略战争的前奏曲。
    马尼拉会议的联合公报，并非美国的独创，苏联修正主义领导集团是有份的，美苏两家的形形色色的追随者也是有份的。葛罗米柯同约翰逊的白宫密谈，苏联领导集团及其追随者在联合国内外的紧张活动，以及印度反动派和铁托集团的奔走，都是这个“以战迫和”的大阴谋的组成部分。要粉碎美帝国主义的这个大阴谋，保卫越南人民和全世界人民的革命利益，也就必须彻底揭穿苏联修正主义领导集团的叛卖活动，同这一伙无耻的叛徒进行不调和的斗争。
    当前越南问题的核心，是美国侵略军立即全部从南越撤走的问题。任何不要美国立即全部撤军而提出的“和谈”与“调解”，都是为美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策效劳的。这是一个大是大非的问题，是一个不容含混的原则问题。如果这个原则受到破坏，那就不仅损害越南人民的利益，而且损害全世界人民的利益。柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王说得对：“要结束越南冲突而应该遵循的唯一道路，就是要求美国人从越南撤走”，“这是无需举行谈判和进行调停的”。
    越南人民是顶天立地的伟大的人民。他们在抗美救国的伟大斗争中取得了辉煌胜利。他们不断地揭穿和粉碎了美帝国主义及其追随者的各式各样的阴谋花招。这样的人民是不可战胜的。胡志明主席最近再一次向全体越南人民发出庄严的号召：“越南人民要团结一致，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，决心战胜美国侵略强盗”；“敌人一定失败，越南人民一定胜利”。毫无疑问，三千一百万越南人民，将在这个战斗号召下，排除万难，向着抗美救国斗争的最后胜利，奋勇前进！
