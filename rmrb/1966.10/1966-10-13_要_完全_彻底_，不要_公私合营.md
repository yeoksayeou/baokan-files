Last year, a fire broke out at a certain paper pulp factory. The raging flames, fanned by the wind, burned more fiercely, and state property was in imminent danger of severe loss. The situation was extremely urgent. At this time, our platoon rushed to the scene and launched a fierce battle to extinguish the fire. The platoon leader shouted, "Follow me!" and took a leap forward, fearlessly using fire-fighting tools to beat back the flames. I also followed the platoon leader into the battle. At this moment, I saw the sixth squad leader take off his clothes to carry soil to extinguish the fire, and I also took off my new military uniform, pressing bundle after bundle of soil onto the flames, working very hard. Under the joint efforts of all the comrades in the platoon, the fire was quickly extinguished.

The next day, a summary meeting was held for the fire-fighting battle. I thought I would definitely be praised this time. When the instructor read out the names, I listened carefully. But when the names were finished, there was no mention of me. I thought: I was at the forefront, fearless of danger, and for carrying soil and extinguishing the fire, I even got my new military uniform dirty, but in the end, I didn't even get a word of praise. I was very unhappy.

With this question in mind, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." The more I studied, the more I felt that my thoughts were wrong. Serving the people must be "complete" and "thorough." How can one do something just to be praised? Doing something just to be praised is not truly serving the people wholeheartedly. From then on, I used the two standards of "complete" and "thorough" to strictly demand of myself, and my ideological transformation achieved great success.

This incident made me understand: ideological transformation cannot be mixed with any falsehood. The struggle between public and private is a struggle of annihilation, and it is absolutely not possible to have a "public-private joint venture" or "peaceful coexistence." The idea that "a little bit of individualism does not affect serving the people" is wrong. One must insist on the high standard of "complete" and "thorough" to carry out ideological transformation in order to make progress; otherwise, eliminating private interests and establishing public interests would be just empty talk.

    要“完全”“彻底”，不要“公私合营”
    战士  李双祥
    去年，某造纸原料场失火了。熊熊的烈火借着风威，越烧越猛，国家财产眼看要受到严重损失，情况十分危急。这时，我们连赶到火场，展开了一场激烈的灭火战斗。连长大喊一声，“跟我上！”一个箭步冲了上去，奋不顾身地用灭火工具扑打火苗。我也紧跟着连长投入了战斗。这时候，我看见六班长脱下自己的衣服运土压火，我也脱下崭新的军装，把一包包土压在火焰上，干得很起劲。在全连同志的奋勇抢救下，火很快被扑灭了。
    第二天作救火战斗总结，我满以为这次该受到表扬了。指导员念名单时，我就仔细听着。可是名字念完了并没有我。心想：我冲在前面，不怕危险，为运土扑火把新军装都弄脏了，结果连个表扬也没捞到。心里非常不高兴。
    带着这个问题，我学习了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，越学越觉得自己的思想很不对头。为人民服务要“完全”“彻底”，怎么能为了受表扬呢？为了受到表扬才去干某一件事，那就算不得全心全意为人民服务。从此以后，我就用“完全”“彻底”这两把尺子严格要求自己，思想改造取得了很大成绩。
    这件事使我懂得了：思想改造不能掺一点假。公和私之间的斗争是有你无我的斗争，绝对不能搞什么“公私合营”、“和平共处”。所谓“有点小个人主义也不影响为人民服务”的说法是不对的。必须坚持“完全”“彻底”这个高标准来进行思想改造才能取得进步，否则，破私立公就是一句空话。
