With Mao Zedong Thought, we are fearless and full of energy. We are not afraid of wind, rain, pests, or drought. We have the power to transform the world.

Fangxiang Brigade in Jiangsu Province's Yanhong County persists in studying Chairman Mao's works during the busy agricultural season, effectively boosting the enthusiasm of the brigade members and promoting agricultural production.

The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Fangxiang Brigade began last autumn. They always prioritize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in their production struggles, achieving great victories on both the spiritual and material fronts. Previously, this brigade had the lowest yield of summer crops in the entire commune. This year, the cost of producing three types of wheat was reduced by 3%, and the average yield increased by 26% compared to last year, making it the high-yield brigade in the commune. The early rice that has been harvested has an average yield of over 600 jin per mu, a 33.3% increase compared to last year, with the highest yield reaching 842 jin per mu. Elderly people in their 60s and 70s said: "We have never seen such a high yield in our lives. The people are the same, and the land is the same. Why did we achieve such a significant increase in yield this year?" Everyone has a few sayings: "Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun, shining on Fangxiang Brigade and transforming it. People listen to Chairman Mao, and the land listens to people. People change their minds, and the land changes its appearance. Spirit becomes matter, and Mao Zedong Thought produces high yields." Many cadres have realized that the busier we are, the more we need to study Chairman Mao's works. With Mao Zedong Thought, we are fearless and full of energy. We are not afraid of wind, rain, pests, or drought. We have the power to transform the world.

Can we persist in studying Chairman Mao's works during the busy agricultural season? Initially, everyone's understanding was not the same. Some said: "Study more during the off-season and less during the busy season. Take a break during the peak season." Their reasoning was that the season does not wait for people, and it doesn't matter if studying Chairman Mao's works is delayed for a few days. Others said: "Gold paves the ground, and the young and old bend over. As soon as we open our eyes, we are busy until the lights are on. Where is the time to study?" A few cadres also thought: "Everyone has studied enough, and we can get by without studying." After these thoughts were exposed, the Party branch first organized the cadres to study Chairman Mao's quotations on grasping ideological education, realizing that if political and ideological work is not done well, production tasks cannot be completed.

The Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations such as "Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. The situation is constantly changing, and to make our thoughts adapt to the new situation, we must study." This further made everyone realize that studying cannot be relaxed for a moment. Old poor peasant Fang Jinchang said: "If we do not study Chairman Mao's works for a day, our consciousness cannot be raised. We must study no matter how busy we are." Poor peasant Kong Lanying said: "No matter how busy we are, we cannot forget to study Chairman Mao's works." Everyone thought that because there are many farm tasks, heavy workloads, tight deadlines, and complex problems, we must even more use Mao Zedong Thought as the banner. The hoe needs to be held by people, and people's thoughts control the hoe. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought understand what revolution is and will consciously connect their labor with the revolution of the whole country and the world. They will fear neither hardship nor difficulty and will be skilled and enthusiastic in production struggles. Many people recalled: This year's wheat increase was due to everyone studying Chairman Mao's works, using the thought of serving the public to overcome selfishness, and using the thought of hard work to overcome the fear of difficulties. Therefore, when it rained, everyone rushed to plant in the rain; when it froze, they broke the ice to fertilize.

According to the specific situation during the busy agricultural season, the Party branch selected Chairman Mao's quotations on class and class struggle, serving the people, moving mountains, and thrift, for everyone to study. During the study, the Party branch firmly grasped the struggle between the two thoughts and two roads, cultivating the communist virtue of "completely selfless and dedicated to others," establishing the thought of facing difficulties head-on, achieving good collection and management, opposing extravagance and waste, and paying attention to thrift. On the day of the Red Star Production Team's harvest, many wheat grains were dropped in the morning. After lunch, team leader Xu Zhaoliang gathered the team members to study Chairman Mao's quotation: "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious.' The Communist Party is the most serious about 'serious.'" In the afternoon, everyone was very careful when harvesting wheat, and even if a few grains were dropped, they were picked up.

In terms of study methods, they were flexible and varied according to local conditions. The entire brigade used old wooden boards and used fertilizer plastic bags to write more than a hundred large and small quotation boards, which were carried to the fields and threshing floors by work teams, achieving the goal of studying and applying at any time. Everyone said: "Carry the quotation boards to the fields, look up and study, compare with Chairman Mao's words, and thousands of difficulties can be overcome."

To strengthen study guidance, Fangxiang Brigade also organized a core group to study Chairman Mao's works, using spare time to hold small group leader meetings, check study situations, and exchange study experiences.

Fangxiang Brigade's persistence in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the busy season has effectively promoted the thought revolution of cadres and brigade members. During the busy season, there were continuous good deeds of unity, friendship, concern for the collective, and selfless labor. Despite the weak production foundation, insufficient tools, livestock, and funds, Fangxiang Brigade relied on its own strength, overcame difficulties, and completed the production tasks well.

During the current autumn harvest and planting, cadres and brigade members have carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, studied and applied them everywhere, and made the autumn production lively and vigorous. In addition to rushing to harvest the already ripe middle-season rice and achieving precise harvesting, fine threshing, and grain collection, they also carried forward the spirit of hard work, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous battle, squeezing out time to accumulate fertilizer. The entire brigade has already had sufficient base fertilizer for 80% of the autumn planting land. (With pictures)

### 方巷大队农忙季节坚持学习毛主席著作

    有了毛泽东思想，我们浑身是胆，全身是劲，风雨虫旱都不怕，改天换地力量大。
    方巷大队农忙季节坚持学习毛主席著作
    干部和社员团结友爱，关心集体，忘我劳动，夺得夏秋两季好收成
    编者按：方巷大队在农忙期间，组织干部和社员学习毛主席著作，这是个好经验。
    有的人认为，事情一忙，工作都顾不过来，那有精力来学习。在他们看来，只要把工作抓紧抓好就行了，学习可以往后推。
    方巷大队和许多单位的经验一再证明，这种看法是不对的。
    事实上，我们工作越忙，越要好好学习毛主席著作。看来学习占了一些时间，其实是大大节约了时间。精神状态不一样，工作效果就不一样。人的思想革命化了，积极性提高了，干劲鼓足了，各项工作就可以做得又多，又快，又好，又省。
    反之，如果不抓紧毛主席著作的学习，不抓紧政治思想工作，思想问题一大堆，工作是怎么也搞不好的。即使成绩暂时上去了，也会退下来。
    本报讯　江苏省邗江县方巷公社方巷大队社员，在生产大忙季节，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，有效地提高了社员的劳动积极性，促进了农业生产的发展。
    方巷大队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，是从去年秋天开始的。他们在生产斗争中始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，在精神和物质两条战线上，都取得了很大的胜利。过去这个大队夏熟作物产量在全公社是最低的。今年三麦成本降低了百分之三，平均单产比去年增产百分之二十六，一跃而为全公社的高产队。已收割的早稻平均亩产都在六百斤以上，比去年增产百分之三十三点三，最高的亩产达八百四十二斤。六七十岁的老年人说：我们活了这么大年纪，从来没有见过一亩田打这么多稻。人还是原来的人，地还是原来的地，为什么今年会获得这样大幅度的增产呢？大家有这样几句话：毛泽东思想是红太阳，照得方巷大队变了样，人听毛主席的话，地听人的话，人换思想地换装，精神变物质，毛泽东思想出高产。很多干部体会到，越忙越要学习毛主席著作。有了毛泽东思想，我们浑身是胆，全身是劲，风雨虫旱都不怕，改天换地力量大。
    在生产大忙中，能不能坚持学习毛主席著作？起初，大家的认识并不一致。有人说：“农闲多学，农忙少学，大忙放假。”他们的理由是，季节不饶人，学习毛主席著作迟几天不要紧。还有人说：“黄金铺地，老少弯腰，眼睛一睁，忙到点灯，哪里有时间学习。”也有少数干部认为：“大家已经学得差不多了，不学也能应付过去。”这些活思想暴露出来以后，党支部首先组织干部学习了毛主席有关掌握思想教育的语录，认识到如果不做好政治思想工作，生产任务是完成不好的。
    党支部组织大家学习了毛主席的“政治是统帅，是灵魂。”“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”等语录，使大家进一步认识到学习一刻也不能放松。老贫农房金昌说：“一天不学习毛主席著作，觉悟就不能提高，再忙也要学习。”贫农孔兰英说：“千忙万忙，学习毛主席著作不能忘。”大家认为，正因为农活多、任务重、季节紧、问题复杂，就越要用毛泽东思想挂帅。锄头是要人拿的，人的思想支配锄头。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，懂得了什么是革命，就会自觉地把自己的劳动同全国、全世界的革命联系起来，就会一不怕苦，二不怕难，就会在生产斗争中心灵手巧干劲大。许多人回顾说：今年三麦增产，就是由于大家学了毛主席著作，以一心为公的思想克服了自私自利的思想，用艰苦奋斗的思想战胜了害怕困难的思想。因此，下雨，大家就冒雨抢种；结冰，就破冰积肥。
    党支部根据农忙期间的具体情况，选择了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争，为人民服务，愚公移山，以及勤俭节约的语录，供大家学习。在学习中，党支部狠抓两种思想两条道路的斗争，培养“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义品德，树立见困难就上的思想，做到收好、管好，反对铺张浪费，注意节约。红日生产队开镰收割那天，上午掉的麦穗较多。中饭后，生产队长许兆良把社员召集在一起，学习了毛主席语录：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”下午割麦，大家都很精心，偶尔掉了穗子，也都拾起来。
    他们在学习方法上，因地制宜，灵活多样。全大队用旧木板和用过的化肥塑料袋，写了大大小小一百多块语录牌，由作业组带到田头、场头，做到随时学，随时用。大家说：“语录牌田头带，抬头一看学起来，毛主席话儿一对照，千难万难能排开。”
    为了加强学习辅导，方巷大队还组织了学习毛主席著作中心小组，利用空隙时间召开小组长会议，检查学习情况，交流学习经验。
    方巷大队坚持在大忙期间活学活用毛主席著作，有力地促进了干部和社员的思想革命化。在大忙中，团结友爱，关心集体，忘我劳动的好人好事不断出现。方巷大队在生产底子薄，农具、畜力、资金都不足的情况下，依靠自己的力量，克服困难，生产任务完成得很好。
    在目前的秋收秋播中，干部和社员做到了《毛主席语录》随身带，处处学起来，事事用起来，把秋季生产搞得热火朝天。除了抢割已经成熟的中稻，做到精收细打，颗粒归仓外，还发扬艰苦奋斗，不怕疲劳，连续作战的精神，挤出时间大搞积肥。全大队已有百分之八十的秋播地有了足够的基肥。（附图片）
