New York, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) — As the U.S. imperialists are actively plotting to intensify and expand the war in Vietnam, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech on Oct. 7 about U.S. policy towards Europe, advocating for the "peaceful bridging" of the rift with the Soviet Union and promoting greater "reconciliation" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This is to facilitate the U.S. in concentrating its forces to escalate the war in Vietnam.

Johnson, in his speech at the National Conference of Newspaper Editors, emphasized that a "wind of change" (i.e., the wind of peaceful evolution) is blowing through the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He said that the U.S. does not want its differences with the Soviet Union in Vietnam or elsewhere to "prevent us from exploring every opportunity." The U.S. hopes that the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries know that the U.S. and its allies "will go step by step with them, as far as they are willing to go." He also expressed that the U.S.'s consistent policy towards the Soviet Union is to use both "deterrence" and "peaceful evolution."

Johnson listed several actions that U.S. imperialism is taking and plans to take to further promote the "wind of change" in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. These include urging Congress to ratify the U.S.-Soviet consular agreement early, preparing to grant most-favored-nation tariff treatment to Eastern European countries, easing exports, and providing commercial loans. To promote the peaceful evolution of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, he vigorously advocated that "Americans and all Europeans share a common bond beyond political differences," a "common civilization," and a "common destiny." The U.S. aims to establish a "continent where East and West Europeans work together for common interests" and achieve so-called "true reconciliation" in Europe.

After outlining these measures to "improve relations," Johnson then demanded that the Soviet revisionist leadership make new deals with the U.S. on the issue of preventing nuclear proliferation. He also specifically requested that the Soviet Union and the U.S. withdraw part of their troops from Eastern and Western Europe, respectively, to allow the U.S. to redeploy its forces to the Vietnam War.

The head of U.S. imperialism also advocated for the "reunification" of Germany under the condition of "improving East-West relations" and "building a greater Europe." This means that the Soviet revisionist leadership would hand over the German Democratic Republic to the West German militaristic clique.

At the same time, Johnson brandished the big stick, issuing threats. He stressed that the U.S.'s first concern is to maintain the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and "no one should doubt the obligations the U.S. has undertaken in Western Europe."

According to Western news agencies, Johnson's speech is the result of six months of internal research and debate by the U.S. government on U.S. policy towards Europe. This speech makes Johnson's scheduled meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in Washington on Oct. 10 "unusually significant."

    苏修集团的“和平演变”助长了美帝侵略野心
    约翰逊鼓吹东西欧拆墙搭桥合二为一
    要苏联从东欧撤退部分军队以便美国放手抽调兵力加紧侵越
    新华社八日讯　纽约消息：在美帝国主义正积极策划加剧和扩大侵越战争的时候，美国总统约翰逊七日就美国对欧洲的政策发表一篇讲话，鼓吹加紧“和平地弥合”同苏联的“裂痕”，实行美苏之间更大的“和解”，以便于美国更集中力量放手进行侵越战争。
    约翰逊在美国全国报刊主编会议上发表演说强调，苏联东欧“正在吹过改变之风”（就是和平演变之风）。他说，美国不想让它和苏联在越南或者其他地方的所谓“分歧”“来阻止我们探讨一切机会”，美国希望苏联和东欧国家知道，美国和它的盟国“将同它们一起一步一步地走下去，它们愿意走多远就走多远”。他同时表示，美国对苏联始终如一的政策是“威慑”与“和平演变”并用。
    约翰逊列举了美帝国主义为进一步促进苏联东欧的“改变之风”，而正在采取和将要采取的一些行动，其中包括：要国会早日批准美苏领事协议，准备给东欧国家最惠国关税待遇以及放宽出口和给予商业贷款等。为了推动苏联东欧国家的和平演变，他竭力鼓吹“美国人和所有的欧洲人之间有一种超越政治分歧的共同联系”，“共同的文明”，“共同的命运”。美国要建立“一个东西欧人民为了共同的利益而在一起工作的大陆”，在欧洲实现所谓“真正的和解”。
    约翰逊在历述了这样一些“改善关系”的措施之后，接着又要求苏联修正主义领导集团在防止核扩散问题上同美国作出新的交易。他还特别要苏联同美国一起分别从东西欧撤退部分军队，以便于美国能够抽出兵力用于侵越战争。
    这个美帝国主义的头子还鼓吹在“改善东西方关系”、“建立一个更大的欧洲”的情况下，实现德国的“重新统一”。这就是要苏联修正主义领导集团拱手把德意志民主共和国交给西德军国主义集团。
    同时，约翰逊挥舞大棒，发出威胁。他强调美国“关心的第一件事是北大西洋公约组织保持强大”，“谁也不要怀疑美国（在西欧）承担的义务”。
    据西方通讯社报道，约翰逊的这篇演说，是美国政府就美国对欧政策进行了六个月的内部研究和辩论的结果。这篇演说使约翰逊订于十日在华盛顿同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯举行的会谈“具有不同寻常的重要性”。
