A certain regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region's Sixth Company recently held a meeting to commemorate the 21st anniversary of Chairman Mao's "On the Negotiations in Chongqing." During the meeting, cadres and soldiers recalled the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggles and the company's glorious history, linked it to the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and shared their insights on studying "On the Negotiations in Chongqing." Everyone expressed their determination to forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao in the great storms of class struggle and bravely advance.

Political Instructor Liao Kuansui said, Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Negotiations in Chongqing" shines with the great thought of daring to struggle and daring to win. Twenty-one years ago, the sky over our motherland was dark with clouds. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to seize the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, disregarded the wishes of the entire nation for peace and actively prepared for civil war. To smash Chiang Kai-shek's war plot and safeguard the interests of the entire nation, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, disregarding personal safety, personally went to the reactionary stronghold of Chongqing at that time to negotiate. The ink on the "Double Ten Agreement" had not yet dried when Chiang Kai-shek blatantly tore up this agreement and launched a counter-revolutionary war against the communists and the people. Under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, the Chinese people and the Chiang bandits engaged in a head-on struggle. After nearly four years of arduous struggle, they finally overthrew the Chiang dynasty and established New China. Decades of revolutionary practice have proven that our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest, bravest, most resolute, and most thorough revolutionary in the history of the Chinese and world revolutions. Chairman Mao's great example and brilliant thought of daring to struggle and daring to win have always been a great driving force for the Chinese people to engage in head-on struggles with any enemy and to carry the revolutionary cause to the end.

During the war years, our company, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "this army has a spirit of marching forward without fear of sacrifice, it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy," closely followed the great commander to make revolution. Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the fearless spirit of marching forward, we were not afraid of heaven or earth, and with the spirit of daring to do so, we fought many hard battles, trampled the enemy, achieved victory, and won the honorable title of a model combat company. Today, re-reading the brilliant work "On the Negotiations in Chongqing," we must learn from Chairman Mao's great example, carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, forever follow the great commander Chairman Mao in the great storms of class struggle, and bravely advance, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and to carry the socialist revolution to the end.

Five Good Soldier Xiao Bingxiong said, today, re-reading "On the Negotiations in Chongqing," every word and sentence feels particularly close to my heart. Chairman Mao's work, from beginning to end, is permeated with the spirit of daring. It teaches us that in revolution, we must not be afraid of difficulties and must have the revolutionary heroism of daring to struggle and daring to win. Whenever I encounter difficulties, I think of Chairman Mao's teaching, and it adds boundless strength to me. In military training, every day, fully equipped, facing the wind and rain, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, after climbing a few hills, I am already sweating profusely. I really feel a bit tired. The company commander saw through my thoughts and came to help me, learning "On the Negotiations in Chongqing" together. Chairman Mao taught, "What is work? Work is struggle.... We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade." These words deeply educated me. I examined myself and the more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt, so I made up my mind not to fear hardship, to train well, and to stand out for the people of the world. Once, our class participated in the regiment's assessment, carrying backpacks and full equipment, running more than ten miles of mountain roads, climbing six hills, and crossing three streams. My whole body was soaked with sweat. When it came to the final item, my stomach suddenly started to hurt, and cold sweat beaded on my forehead. I really wanted to stop and rest, but at that moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching of "work is struggle" and the heavy responsibility of the world revolution on our shoulders, and I felt energized all over, finally persevering to the end of the assessment. This experience made me realize that all difficulties are paper tigers. They can only scare those with weak wills. In the face of revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, mountains will bow their heads, and rivers will give way, and no difficulty will be a problem.

Active learner of Chairman Mao's works and new soldier Huo Laosheng said, in "On the Negotiations in Chongqing," Chairman Mao pointed out: "On the road of revolution, there are still many obstacles and difficulties.... We must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and struggle against difficulties." Repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's instruction, I deeply feel that: to be a proletarian revolutionary soldier, one must not only dare to struggle and dare to revolutionize, but also be good at struggling and revolutionizing.

In the past, I did not understand this truth well and did not like to use my brain in my work. Once, the company commander asked me to take a few comrades to an outer island to transport a ship of fresh water. The company commander said: "This task is very arduous, you and the others should study it well." At that time, I did not say anything, but in my heart, I thought: transporting a ship of fresh water, what's difficult about that, what's there to study! The next day, we five people took three buckets and rowed the boat away. To save trouble, we did not even wear shoes. When we arrived on the island and asked around, we found that the water source was in the mountain valley in the center of the island, and the boat could not go in. Carrying a load of water required crossing a mountain and a dam, walking for fifteen minutes. We borrowed five loads of buckets from a brother company, without shoes, with stones under our feet, we endured the pain and carried on until six o'clock in the afternoon before we finally filled a ship with fresh water. When we returned to the company, it was already dark. The company commander asked me about the situation of transporting water, and I told him the truth. The company commander kindly said: "Little Huo, doing revolution cannot be done with just a rush of spirit! Chairman Mao teaches us: strategically, we must despise the enemy, tactically, we must take the enemy seriously. The same goes for difficulties, just despising them without taking them seriously will lead to losses." One incident, one lesson. From then on, every time before transporting water, we made full preparations, and thus successfully completed the task of loading and transporting fresh water.

How can we combine daring to revolutionize and being good at revolutionizing well? My experience is: the most fundamental thing is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. No matter what problems and difficulties we encounter, we must think more and think about how Chairman Mao taught us. Chairman Mao's words are the highest and most powerful, every sentence is the truth. Whatever is in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, we must firmly carry them out; whatever is not in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, we must firmly oppose them. In this way, we can clarify the direction of the struggle, determine the methods of defeating the enemy, and break through any difficulties and obstacles on the road of revolution, forever advancing from victory to victory.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are currently carrying out is a great revolution that touches people's souls. In this life-and-death class struggle, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, be daring and good at revolutionizing, take the Sixteen Points as a weapon, resolutely overthrow, overthrow, and expose a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, resolutely complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and will not stop until we achieve complete victory!

    永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席在阶级斗争大风浪中奋勇前进
    ——广州部队某团六连纪念《关于重庆谈判》发表二十一周年座谈纪要
    人民解放军广州部队某团六连为纪念毛主席《关于重庆谈判》发表二十一周年，最近召开了座谈会。会上，干部战士回忆中国人民革命斗争史和连队光荣史，联系当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，畅谈学习《关于重庆谈判》的心得体会。大家表示，决心永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进。
    永远记住毛主席的教导，敢于同任何敌人进行针锋相对的斗争
    政治指导员廖宽遂说，毛主席《关于重庆谈判》这篇光辉著作，闪烁着敢于斗争，敢于胜利的伟大思想光辉。二十一年前，祖国的天空乌云密布。蒋介石为了抢夺抗日战争的胜利果实，不顾全国人民的和平愿望，积极准备内战。为了粉碎蒋介石的战争阴谋，维护全国人民的利益，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，不顾个人安危，亲自到当时蒋匪帮的反动统治中心重庆去谈判；《双十协定》墨迹未干，蒋介石公然撕毁这一协定，发动了反共反人民的内战。在毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民和蒋匪帮展开了针锋相对的斗争，经过近四年的艰苦奋战，终于推翻了蒋家王朝，建立了新中国。几十年来的革命实践证明，我们的伟大领袖毛主席是中国和世界革命史上最伟大、最勇敢、最坚决、最彻底的革命者。毛主席敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大榜样和光辉思想，一直是激励中国人民同任何强敌进行针锋相对的斗争，将革命事业进行到底的巨大动力。
    在战争年代里，我们连队按照毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导，紧紧跟着伟大统帅闹革命，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠一往无前的大无畏精神，天不怕，地不怕，“敢”字当头，打了许多硬仗，压倒了敌人，取得了胜利，获得了战斗模范连的光荣称号。今天，重温《关于重庆谈判》这一光辉著作，我们一定要学习毛主席的伟大榜样，发扬敢于斗争，敢于胜利的大无畏革命精神，永远跟着伟大统帅毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    干革命必须发扬敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命英雄气概
    五好战士萧炳雄说，今天重读《关于重庆谈判》，字字句句都感到格外亲切。毛主席这篇著作，自始至终贯串着一个“敢”字，教导我们干革命不能怕困难，要有敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命英雄气概。每当我遇到困难的时候，想起毛主席的这一教导，就增添了无穷无尽的力量。在军事训练中，每天全副武装，披风顶雨，爬山涉水，冲了几个山头，就汗流浃背，我真觉得有些累。连长看透我的心事，便来帮助我，和我一起学习《关于重庆谈判》。毛主席教导说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。……我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这一段话深深地教育了我。我对照检查自己，越想越惭愧，便下定决心不畏艰苦，练好本领，为世界人民立功。有一次，我们班参加团的考核，背着背包和全副武装，跑了十多里山路，爬了六个山头，过了三道小溪，我全身都被汗水湿透了。进行最后一个课目时，我的胃突然痛起来，额角直冒冷汗，真想停下来休息，这时我想起毛主席“工作就是斗争”的教导，想起我们肩负的世界革命的重担，浑身都来劲了，终于坚持到考核结束。这一段经历，使我认识到：一切困难都是纸老虎，它只能吓倒那些意志薄弱的软骨头。在以毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士面前，高山要低头，河水得让路，任何困难都不在话下。
    把敢于革命和善于革命结合起来，将革命进行到底
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、新战士霍佬胜说，毛主席在《关于重庆谈判》中指出：“在革命的道路上还有许多障碍物，还有许多困难。……我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”反复学习毛主席这个指示，我深深体会到：做一个无产阶级革命战士既要敢于斗争，敢于革命，也要善于斗争、善于革命。
    过去我不大懂得这个道理，干工作不爱动脑子。一次，连长叫我带几个同志到外岛运一船淡水。连长说：“这个任务很艰巨，你和大伙好好研究一下。”当时我嘴里没说，心里却想：运一船淡水，有什么难的，有啥好研究的！第二天，我们五个人带了三副水桶，划着船就走了。为了图省事，我们连鞋也没穿。到了岛上一打听，水源在岛中心的山谷里，船开不进去，挑一担水要翻山过堤，走十五分钟。我们到兄弟连队借了五担桶，没穿鞋，石子垫脚，我们忍着痛，一直挑到下午六点钟，才挑满一船淡水。运回连队时，天已全黑了。连长问起我运水的情况，我照实说了。连长亲切地说：“小霍，干革命不能光凭一股猛劲呀！毛主席教导我们：战略上要藐视敌人，战术上要重视敌人。对待困难也一样，光藐视不重视是要吃亏的。”经一事，长一智。从此以后，每次运水前，我们都做好充分的准备，因而顺利地完成了装运淡水的任务。
    怎样才能把敢于革命和善于革命很好地结合起来呢？我的体会是：最根本的就是在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，照毛主席指示办事。不管碰到什么问题和困难，都要多动脑筋想一想，多想毛主席是怎样教导的。毛主席的话，水平最高，威力最大，句句都是真理。凡是符合毛主席指示的，坚决执行；凡是不符合毛主席指示的，坚决反对。这样就能明确斗争的方向，确定克敌制胜的方法，就能冲破革命道路上的任何困难障碍，永远从胜利走向胜利。
    我们正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命。在这场你死我活的阶级斗争中，我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，做敢于革命、善于革命的闯将，以十六条为武器，坚决把一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派斗垮、斗倒、斗臭，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，坚决完成一斗二批三改的任务，不获全胜，决不收兵！（据新华社广州十七日电）
