Guizhou Province has recently completed and put into operation seven new phosphate fertilizer plants. These newly built plants have an annual production capacity of fourteen thousand tons of chemical fertilizers.

Since this year, the chemical industry department and various construction units in Guizhou have been focusing on both revolution and production, achieving a faster pace of chemical fertilizer industry construction than in previous years.

By the beginning of September, the province's new chemical fertilizer production capacity has nearly doubled compared to last year's production capacity.

    贵州省又新建七座磷肥厂
    贵州省最近又有七个磷肥厂先后建成并投入生产。这批新建的磷肥厂每年能生产十四万吨化肥。
    今年以来，贵州化学工业部门和各施工单位一手抓革命，一手抓生产，使化肥工业建设速度比历年都快。
    到九月上旬为止，全省新增的化肥生产能力，等于去年生产能力的近一倍半。
