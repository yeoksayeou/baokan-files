	Guangxi Film Machinery Factory's revolutionary workers, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, embodying the daring spirit of revolutionary innovation. They have successfully developed the "Zhuangzhi" brand 16mm lightweight film projector. This projector weighs only 26 kilograms, more than half the weight of the "Changjiang" brand 16mm projector, making it possible for two people to carry it, which is suitable for mobile screenings in multi-ethnic and remote areas.

    广西制成轻便型放映机
    广西电影机械厂革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬敢想敢闯的革命精神，试制成功“壮志牌”十六毫米轻便型电影放映机。这种放映机仅重二十六公斤，比“长江牌”十六毫米放映机轻一半以上，两个人就可以背着走，适合在多民族地区和边远地区巡回放映。
