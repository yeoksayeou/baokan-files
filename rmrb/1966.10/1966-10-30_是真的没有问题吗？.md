The secretary of the Party branch of Xidachuan Brigade, Hongjiang City, Jilin Province, Yang Chengshan, discussed holding a Party life meeting with the deputy secretary of the branch, Yin Yuceng. Yin Yuceng said: “There is no problem that needs to be solved. Whether or not to hold Party days is fine either way. I think we should just drop it.”

Yang Chengshan thought: It is not that the branch has no problems, but rather that some Party members have developed a complacent attitude. If this mindset is not changed, it will be impossible to frequently use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to timely solve the problems that exist within the Party.

The Party branch organized Party members to study the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: “Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the Party. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve them within the Party, the Party’s life will stop.”

After studying Chairman Mao’s teachings, everyone linked them to their own thoughts, found the problems that existed in the branch’s work and in their personal thoughts, and further recognized that criticism and self-criticism are powerful weapons for continuously exposing and resolving contradictions. Therefore, it is necessary to consistently hold Party days.

    是真的没有问题吗？
    吉林省浑江市西大川公社西大川大队党支部书记杨成山，找支部副书记尹玉成研究开党的生活会的问题。尹玉成说：“没有什么问题需要解决了，党日过不过都行，我看算了吧。”杨成山想：并不是支部没有问题，而是部分党员产生了差不多思想。这个思想不改变，就不能经常运用批评和自我批评的武器，及时解决党内存在的问题。
    党支部组织党员学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”学习了毛主席的论述，大家联系思想，找出了支部工作和个人思想中存在的问题，进一步认识到批评和自我批评是不断揭露矛盾、解决矛盾的有力武器，因而必须经常坚持过党日。
