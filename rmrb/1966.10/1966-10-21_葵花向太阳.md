People of various countries have limitless love and admiration for Chairman Mao. Every day, in various parts of the world, there are many touching incidents that reflect the sincere feelings of people from different countries towards our great leader. Here are a few of the countless vivid examples.

Chairman Mao is with us

At a reception held by our embassy in Vietnam, a person from the south who had gathered in North Vietnam put on a badge with Chairman Mao's portrait and requested a photograph of Chairman Mao in military uniform standing on Tiananmen Square. As he gazed at the portrait of Chairman Mao, he said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is with the Chinese people and will always be with the Vietnamese people. Chairman Mao wearing military uniform is a great encouragement to us Vietnamese people. We must fulfill the sacred call of Chairman Hu, hold our rifles tightly, fight to the end, and strive for a thorough victory in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation!"

Flowers for the Great Leader

During China's National Day celebrations, a Polish worker presented a bouquet of flowers to a Chinese comrade in Poland, saying excitedly, "Please present this to the great leader of the working class, Mao Zedong, and to the Chinese revolutionary youth who have emerged under Mao Zedong's leadership during the Cultural Revolution—the Red Guards, and to the great Cultural Revolution." He said, "This bouquet represents the friendship between the Polish people and the Chinese working class. Please accept it as the most beautiful flowers in the world!"

The Great Image in My Heart

At the recent 13th Damascus International Fair, a blind Syrian, guided by his friend, came to the Chinese pavilion. After his friend introduced him, he specially asked his friend to lead him to the portrait of Chairman Mao and describe the great image of Chairman Mao. As he listened, he shouted, "China! Mao Zedong! Long live! Mao Zedong!"

A Precious Gift Expressing My Heart

On the afternoon of September 29, an African student studying in the Soviet Union held up a pillowcase made of sheepskin with both hands and, with a trembling heart, said to the staff of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, "This is a type of pillow that our elderly people like very much. Therefore, I specially present it to Chairman Mao to express our love for Chairman Mao." He then took out a pillow cover and said, "This was sewn by hand for Chairman Mao by my younger sister."

I Want to See Chairman Mao Every Day

A driver named Haidi from Yemen hung the portrait of Chairman Mao, which he obtained from a Chinese friend, neatly on the wall of his home. He said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader. I want to hang the portrait of Chairman Mao so that my friends and the adults and children in my family can see Chairman Mao every day."

    各国革命人民对毛主席无限热爱，无限敬仰。在世界各地每天都有许多动人的事情，反映出各国人民热爱我们伟大领袖的真挚感情。这里报道的是千千万万桩生动事例中的几桩。
    毛主席和我们在一起
    在我驻越南使馆招待会上，一位集结在越南北方的南方人员戴上了毛主席像纪念章，还要求给他一张毛主席穿着军装站在天安门上的照片。他一面端详着毛主席像，一面激动地说：“毛主席和中国人民在一起，也永远和我们越南人民在一起。毛主席穿上了军装，是对我们越南人民很大的鼓舞。我们一定要实现胡主席的神圣号召，握紧枪杆，战斗到底，争取抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利！”
    鲜花献给伟大领袖
    一位波兰普通劳动者在中国国庆期间，把一束鲜花交给在波兰的一位中国同志，激动地说：“请代我把它献给工人阶级的伟大领袖毛泽东，献给那些在毛泽东领导下在文化革命中出现的中国革命青年——红卫兵，献给伟大的文化大革命。”他说：
  “这束花代表波兰人民对中国工人阶级的情谊，请你们把它当作世界上最美丽的鲜花收下吧！”
    伟大的形象记心中
    在最近举行的第十三届大马士革国际博览会中，一位叙利亚的盲人，在他的朋友引导下来到中国馆。他听完朋友介绍后，又特别要他的朋友领他到毛主席像前，给他描述毛主席的伟大形象。他边听，边欢呼：“中国！毛泽东！万岁！毛泽东！”
    珍贵的礼物表心意
    九月二十九日下午，一位非洲留苏学生双手捧出一个用羊皮制作的枕头套，怀着激动的心情对中国驻苏联大使馆工作人员说：“这是我们国家老年人最喜欢用的一种枕头。因此，我特别把它送给毛主席，以表示我们对毛主席的敬爱。”他又拿出一块枕巾说：“这是我妹妹亲手为毛主席缝制的。”
    要天天看到毛主席
    也门一位名叫海迪的司机，把从中国朋友那里要到的毛主席像，端端正正地挂在家里。他说：
  “毛主席是最伟大的领袖。我要把毛主席的像挂起来，让我的朋友和我家里的大人孩子都能天天看到毛主席。”
