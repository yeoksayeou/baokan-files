The people of the whole world are celebrating the new achievements of the Chinese people! The great proletarian cultural revolution initiated by Chairman Mao is advancing in leaps and bounds, and the Chinese people are creating miracles one after another. This is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world and a severe blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will definitely win a complete victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution and make even greater contributions to the world revolution. Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution! Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!
