On the morning of September 21st, a water pipe near a road beside the Hubei Medical College burst. This pipe carried water from the river, and after it burst, water gushed out, reaching a height of over two zhang. The water levels on both sides of the road were uneven, and if the leak was not stopped in time, it would damage the road.

At that moment, part of our unit was working nearby. Seeing the situation, under the leadership of our commanding officers, they rushed over to stop the water. However, the water pressure was too high, and there were not enough hands, so it couldn't be stopped immediately.

At this critical moment, a group of students wearing red guards armbands rushed over. Some brought dry grass, while others brought nothing and, without even taking off their clothes, jumped into the water to fight alongside us. After a while, we repeatedly asked them to rest on the shore. However, they refused, saying, "We will definitely fight shoulder to shoulder with you until the end, and we will not retreat until we achieve complete victory."

After an hour of intense battle, the water was finally stopped. Both the red guards and our comrades were covered in mud. We deeply admired these red guard fighters and unanimously expressed our desire to learn from the red guards. They said, "We are still far from fully and thoroughly serving the people as Chairman Mao said. We still have a lot to learn from the People's Liberation Army."

As they were leaving, we repeatedly asked them which school they were from and their names, but they just smiled and didn't say. From their school badges, we saw that one was from Yan'an University, and a few were from Wuhan University. Later, we found a wet certificate on the ground and learned that the other eight red guards were students from Beijing Haidian District Ganjiapukou Middle School.

### 一场肩并肩的战斗

    一场肩并肩的战斗
    九月二十一日上午，湖北医学院附近一条公路边的水管，被压裂了。这水管是从江边通过来的，管子破裂以后，大量往外喷水，高达两丈多。公路两边水位高低不平，如果不及时堵住，将会把公路冲坏。
    这时候，我们部队一部分人正在附近施工，看到这情景，就在部队首长带领下，飞奔过去堵水。但是水管压力太大，人手不足，一时没有堵住。
    正在紧急关头，一群戴着红卫兵袖章的学生急步跑来。有的抱来干草，有的什么也没拿，连衣服也没脱，就跳进水里和我们一起战斗。过了一会儿，我们一再叫他们上岸休息。可是，他们坚决不肯，一齐说：“我们坚决和你们并肩战斗到底，不获全胜决不收兵。”
    经过一个小时的紧张战斗，终于把水堵住了。红卫兵和我们的同志个个都成了泥人。我们从内心里钦佩这些红卫兵战士，一致表示要向红卫兵学习。他们却说：“我们离毛主席说的‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民服务还相差很远很远，还得很好地向解放军学习。”
    临走时，我们一再问他们是哪个学校的，叫什么名字，他们总是笑着不说。我们从校徽上看出来，一个是延安大学的，有几个是武汉大学的。最后从地上发现了一个打湿的证件，才知道另外八名红卫兵是北京海淀区甘家口中学的学生。
