The Soviet revisionist leadership has recently held talks with the Japanese Sato government in Tokyo and Moscow to further discuss the issue of "joint development" of Siberian and Soviet Far Eastern resources by the Soviet Union and Japanese monopoly capitalists. This is another shameful act by the Soviet leadership to strengthen its full collaboration with Japanese reactionaries.

Since the current Soviet leadership took power, under the guidance of the capitulationist foreign policy line of "Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world," it has been even more blatant than Khrushchev in pursuing a policy of full collaboration with the Japanese Sato government, the main pillar of American imperialism in Asia. It actively advocates for joint action by the Soviet Union and Japan on "a series of important issues." As part of this cooperation, over the past year or so, it has held a series of talks with Japan, seeking to strengthen "Soviet-Japanese economic cooperation," especially begging Japanese monopoly capitalists to "help" it develop Siberia and the Soviet Far East. The Japanese Sato government, taking advantage of the situation where the Soviet leadership is politically and economically dependent on Japan, strongly encourages Japanese monopoly capital to expand into the Soviet Union.

According to reports, a Soviet delegation led by Deputy General Manager Suschkov of the Soviet Oil Export Company has been in Tokyo since late September, holding special talks with Japanese oil monopoly capitalists on the issue of joint development and export of natural gas from the Soviet Far East region of Sakhalin to Japan. The talks are still ongoing. According to preliminary agreements, the Soviet Union has agreed to export 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Sakhalin to Japan annually for 15 to 20 years. According to TASS, as part of the Soviet-Japanese joint development plan for Siberian and Soviet Far Eastern resources, the Soviet delegation has requested to sign a contract with Japan on this issue in the near future. TASS commented on this, saying, "It should be considered that after the signing of this contract, cooperation in other aspects will also be signed."

Just as the talks in Tokyo began, a Japanese government economic delegation composed of representatives from various large companies of the Japanese monopoly capital group had just completed its visit and talks in the Soviet Union. According to reports, this delegation led by Toshizo Arai, president of "Dowa Mining" Company, discussed "Soviet-Japanese cooperation in the development of Siberia and the Soviet Far East" with Soviet government officials such as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Commission Baibakov in Moscow during their 21-day visit to the Soviet Union. During the talks, the Soviet side was very hospitable, saying that if Japanese businessmen were willing to cooperate with Soviet experts in Siberia and the Far East, the Soviet Union would be "prepared to study their proposals." To attract Japanese monopoly capital investment, they proactively raised the issue of cooperation with Japan in the development of Siberian copper mines, as well as the joint development of non-ferrous metals, natural gas, and forest resources in Siberia and the Far East. In addition, they proposed "specific development plans for economic cooperation between the two countries on four projects: rock salt, potash, phosphate, and fluorite." According to Arai, who returned to Tokyo on September 27, during the talks, the Soviet authorities eagerly expressed the hope that the Japanese side would "quickly respond" to the Soviet Union's proposal at the Soviet-Japanese Economic Cooperation Committee (Tokyo) meeting in March this year regarding the two countries' "joint development" of a massive plan for Siberia and the Far East.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's eagerness to pursue "economic cooperation" with Japanese reactionaries is entirely for its line of uniting with American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries to jointly oppose China in the international arena. "Soviet-Japanese economic cooperation" is the product of "Soviet-Japanese political cooperation." Recently, Japanese and American bourgeois newspapers have repeatedly claimed that the Soviet authorities' "pro-Japanese diplomacy" aims to "isolate" China and serves the strategic needs of American imperialism to "encircle" China. The Soviet Union's active request for Japan's assistance in developing Siberia and the Far East is due to the Soviet Union's "policy towards Communist China," which has "defense and political reasons." For this reason, Soviet-Japanese political and economic "cooperation" has always been encouraged by American imperialism. However, the logic of history will go in the opposite direction of what the Soviet revisionists have imagined, and their criminal acts can only further expose their traitorous faces.

    苏修领导集团加紧同日本反动派全面勾结
    乞求日本垄断资本集团开发西伯利亚和苏联远东地区
    美日报刊说苏领导奉行“联日外交”是为美帝包围中国的战略服务
    新华社十一日讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团最近同日本佐藤政府分别在东京和莫斯科举行谈判，进一步讨论苏联同日本垄断资本集团“联合开发”西伯利亚和苏联远东地区资源的问题。这是苏联领导集团为加强同日本反动派的全面勾结，而干出的又一个可耻的勾当。
    苏联现领导上台以来，在苏美合作主宰世界的投降主义外交路线支配下，比赫鲁晓夫更加露骨地推行同美国在亚洲的主要支柱日本佐藤政府全面勾结的“苏日合作”政策，积极鼓吹苏日两国在“一系列重要问题上采取联合行动”。作为这种合作的一个方面，最近一年多来，它同日本已经进行了一系列会谈，要求加强“苏日经济合作”，特别是乞求日本垄断资本集团“帮助”它开发西伯利亚和苏联远东地区。而日本佐藤政府，则利用苏联领导集团在政治上和经济上都有求于日本的情况，极力鼓励日本垄断资本向苏联扩张。
    据报道，由苏联石油出口公司副总经理苏什科夫率领的苏联代表团，从九月底起在东京同日本的石油垄断资本集团就苏日两国联合开发和向日本出口苏联远东地区库页岛的天然气的问题，专门进行会谈。目前，这一会谈尚在进行中。根据初步的协议，苏联已经答应在十五年至二十年内每年从库页岛向日本出口二十亿立方米天然气。据塔斯社透露，作为苏日联合开发西伯利亚和苏联远东资源计划的一部分，苏联代表团已经要求同日本不久将就这个问题签订合同。塔斯社就此发表评论说，“应当认为，继这一合同签订以后，还将签订其他方面的合作”。
    就在东京会谈开始的时候，一个由日本垄断资本集团各大公司的代表组成的日本政府经济代表团刚刚结束在苏联的访问和会谈。据报道，这个由“同合矿业”公司总经理新井友藏率领的代表团，在苏联进行的二十一天访问中，曾经同苏联部长会议副主席、国家计划委员会主席巴伊巴科夫等苏联政府要员在莫斯科讨论了“日苏在开发西伯利亚和苏联远东方面的合作问题”。会谈中，苏联方面大献殷勤，说“如果日本企业家愿意同苏联专家在西伯利亚和远东地区合作的话”，苏联就“准备研究他们的建议”。为了吸引日本垄断资本的投资，他们主动提出了同日本在开发西伯利亚铜矿上进行合作的问题，以及联合开发西伯利亚和远东地区的有色金属、天然气和森林资源的问题。此外，还提出了“苏日两国就岩盐、钾盐、磷矿和萤石等四个项目实行经济合作的具体开发计划”。据新井友藏九月二十七日回到东京时透露，这次会谈期间，苏联当局还急不可待地表示希望日本方面对于苏联今年三月在日苏经济合作委员会（东京）会议上提出的关于两国“联合开发”西伯利亚和远东地区的庞大计划“迅速作出表示”。
    苏联修正主义领导集团如此积极地追求同日本反动派搞“经济合作”，完全是为它在国际上联合美帝国主义和各国反动派共同反华的路线服务的。“苏日经济合作”正是“苏日政治合作”的产物。日本和美国资产阶级报刊，最近就曾一再宣称，苏联当局奉行的“联日外交”以“孤立”中国为目的，是为美帝国主义“包围”中国的战略需要服务的，苏联积极要求日本协助开发西伯利亚和远东地区，是出于苏联“对共产党中国的政策”，有着“国防上和政治上的理由”。正因如此，苏日政治和经济“合作”，一直得到美帝国主义的鼓励。然而，历史的逻辑将向苏联修正主义者所设想的反面走去，他们的罪恶勾当只能进一步暴露他们的叛徒嘴脸。
