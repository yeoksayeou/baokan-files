Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia said that Cambodia will not fall into the trap of the Manila Conference. On the issue of Vietnam, there can be no mediation or negotiation. The only necessary thing is for the United States to withdraw from Vietnam. Cambodia cannot agree with the proposal of the New Delhi Three-Nation Conference to hold negotiations on the Vietnam issue.

	PHNOM PENH, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on October 24, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk said on October 23: Cambodia believes that in the conflict over Vietnam, there is no question of holding negotiations or conducting mediation, because the only necessary thing is for the United States to withdraw from Vietnam and finally respect the right of the Vietnamese people to self-determination, and these things do not require negotiations or mediation.

	Prince Sihanouk made these remarks to representatives of the Cambodian News Agency and the Reuters correspondent stationed in Cambodia. He mentioned an AFP news item from Manila on October 22, which talked about a plan for a "peace conference attended by all Asian countries." The news item also mentioned that, according to reliable sources, Cambodia had rejected a request from the Philippines to act as a mediator. According to the same news source, the Cambodian government had rejected the request on the grounds that the situation was not appropriate. Prince Sihanouk clearly pointed out that the Cambodian government had never given such a reply. Furthermore, the Cambodian government had already made it clear through a denial issued by the Ministry of Information on October 13 that it would not agree to act as an "unsavory broker" on the Vietnam issue. Cambodia's very clear position on this matter has already blocked any possible request for mediation from one country or another. In short, the issue is not whether the situation is "appropriate" or "inappropriate." In fact, today there is only one actual situation caused by U.S. interference in Vietnam, characterized by the violation of rights due to this illegal interference.

	Regarding the various speculations about Cambodia possibly mediating, Prince Sihanouk reiterated: Cambodia will in no way agree to mediate, and therefore, any "feelers" sent to the Cambodian government on this matter are completely useless. In fact, the only way to end the conflict in Vietnam is to demand that the Americans withdraw from Vietnam. However, some places are trying to follow a different path, especially in New Delhi, where three non-aligned countries, India, Yugoslavia, and the United Arab Republic, are currently holding a meeting, and the Vietnam issue is also being discussed there. Prince Sihanouk said that we cannot agree with the proposal of the participating countries to hold negotiations on the Vietnam issue.

	Prince Sihanouk then said regarding the Manila Conference that Cambodia cannot agree to participate in such a conference. He said that this conference will discuss the Vietnam issue, but without the participation of North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, who are the two main parties involved. Moreover, the participants in the Manila Conference, centered around the United States, are all serving the United States and opposing the Vietnamese people. As for Cambodia, it will not fall into the "trap" planned by the Manila Conference. Cambodia only agrees to participate in such an "Asian round-table conference," which would exclude any white countries and those Asian countries that are accomplices in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam.

	Prince Sihanouk finally said: The restoration of external peace in Vietnam completely depends on the United States stopping its aggression, which does not require negotiations or mediation. As for internal peace in this country, that is the business of the Vietnamese people themselves. He pointed out that if the few remaining followers of Nguyen Van Thieu are left to face the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people who support it, then the struggle will be short-lived, and internal peace will soon be restored in South Vietnam.

    西哈努克亲王说柬埔寨决不会落进马尼拉会议的圈套
    在越南问题上谈不到调停和谈判  唯一必需的是美国从越南撤出去
    柬埔寨不能够赞同新德里三国会议就越南问题举行谈判的主张
    新华社金边二十四日电　据柬埔寨新闻社二十四日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十三日发表谈话说：柬埔寨认为，在越南冲突的问题上，谈不上举行谈判，也谈不上进行调停，因为唯一必需的是美国从越南撤走，并最后尊重越南人自决的权利，而这些都是无需举行谈判和进行调停的。
    西哈努克亲王是向柬埔寨新闻社代表和路透社常驻记者发表这次谈话的。他谈到法新社二十二日从马尼拉发出的一条消息，其中提到一项所谓“所有亚洲国家参加的和平会议”的计划。这条消息还谈到“据可靠消息”，柬埔寨拒绝了菲律宾要它充当调停人的要求。据同样的消息来源说，柬埔寨政府是以“情况不适宜”为借口加以拒绝的。西哈努克亲王明确指出，柬埔寨政府从来没有作出过这样的答复，此外，柬埔寨政府已在十月十三日通过新闻部的辟谣声明表示，它决不同意在越南问题上充当“不光彩的掮客”，柬埔寨所采取的这一十分明确的立场，早已堵住了这一国或那一国可能向它提出的调解要求。总之，问题不在于情况是“适宜”或者“不适宜”。实际上，今天只存在一种由美国干涉越南而造成的实际情况，其特点是由于这种非法干涉而侵犯了权利。
    关于柬埔寨可能进行调停的种种猜测，西哈努克亲王重申：柬埔寨无论如何决不同意进行调停，因此，在这个问题上“试探”柬埔寨政府，完全是无益的。事实上，要结束越南冲突而应该遵循的唯一道路，就是要求美国人从越南撤走。可是，有些地方有人打算遵循不同的道路，特别是在新德里，三个不结盟国家印度、南斯拉夫和阿联目前正在那里举行会议，在会上也讨论了越南问题。西哈努克亲王说，我们不能赞同与会国关于就越南问题举行谈判的主张。
    西哈努克亲王接着在谈到马尼拉会议时说，柬埔寨不能同意参加这样一个会议。他说，这次会议将讨论越南问题，但没有北越和越南南方民族解放阵线的参加，而北越和越南南方民族解放阵线却是两个主要的有关方面。何况，以美国为中心的马尼拉会议的参加者都是为美国效劳和反对越南人民的。至于柬埔寨，它决不会落进马尼拉会议所策划的“圈套”里去。柬埔寨只同意参加这样一个亚洲人之间的“圆桌会议”，这个“圆桌会议”要把任何白人国家排除在外，也要把充当美国侵越战争的帮凶的那些亚洲国家排除在外。
    西哈努克亲王最后说：越南对外和平的恢复完全取决于美国停止侵略，这是无需举行谈判和进行调停的。至于这个国家的内部和平，那是越南人自己的事情。他指出，如果让阮高其及其寥寥无几的党羽独自面对越南南方民族解放阵线和支持它的所有的越南人，那么斗争将是短期的，也很快就会在南越恢复内部和平。
