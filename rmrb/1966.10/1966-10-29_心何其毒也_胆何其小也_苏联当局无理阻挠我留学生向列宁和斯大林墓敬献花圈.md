How Vile and How Cowardly

The Soviet authorities unreasonably obstructed Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union from paying their respects to Lenin and Stalin's tombs with wreaths.

On October 26, Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, who were arbitrarily ordered by the Soviet authorities to suspend their studies and leave the country within a specified time, on the eve of their farewell to the Soviet people, with hearts full of admiration for the great leader of the proletariat, wanted to pay their respects to Lenin's remains and Stalin's tomb once more. However, they encountered numerous obstacles set up by the Soviet authorities. The Soviet authorities broke their promises and created countless difficulties, attempting to obstruct Chinese students from paying their respects to Lenin and Stalin's tombs with wreaths. The Soviet authorities' despicable actions once again exposed their evil intentions to sabotage the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and fully reflected their weak nature of fearing the people, fearing the truth, and fearing revolution.

    心何其毒也　胆何其小也
    苏联当局无理阻挠我留学生向列宁和斯大林墓敬献花圈
    十月二十六日，被苏联当局无理勒令休学并限期离境的中国留苏学生，在向苏联人民告别的前夕，怀着对无产阶级伟大领袖无限敬仰的心情，想再次瞻仰列宁的遗容和斯大林墓，竟遇到苏联当局设下的重重障碍。苏联当局不守诺言，百般刁难，妄想阻挠中国留学生向列宁和斯大林墓敬献花圈。苏联当局的这种卑劣行径，再一次暴露了他们蓄意破坏中苏人民友谊的丑恶嘴脸，也充分反映了他们害怕人民、害怕真理、害怕革命的虚弱本质。（附图片）

    苏联当局出动了大批警察，红场四周戒备森严，三步一岗，五步一哨，如临大敌。
