Japanese youth held rallies and protest marches again on October 1 to denounce the Sato government's refusal to issue visas to Japanese youth for visits to China and its continued obstruction of Japanese youth's participation in the Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Festival.

More than 250 Japanese youth held a protest rally in the morning at the National Railway Labor Hall in Tokyo. The rally unanimously adopted the policy of fighting for visas to visit China and for the realization of the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Festival. This policy stipulates that the struggle to realize the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Festival will be carried out to the end, and that the struggle will not be abandoned until complete victory is achieved.

In the afternoon, more than 400 Japanese youth preparing to participate in the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Festival, along with supporting organizations and union workers, held a protest rally in Tokyo's Shiba Children's Park.
