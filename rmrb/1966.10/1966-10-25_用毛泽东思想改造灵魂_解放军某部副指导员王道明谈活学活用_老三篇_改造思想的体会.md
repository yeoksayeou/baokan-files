Editor's Note: Chairman Mao said, "A change in worldview is a fundamental change." Comrade Wang Daoming, following Chairman Mao's instructions, has diligently studied the "Three Articles" and bravely carried out a revolution in the depths of his soul. His experiences and insights are educational for every comrade.

We all live in socialist New China. Our new society did not fall from the sky; it emerged from the old society. The influences of the old society affect not only the elderly and middle-aged, but also the younger generation to varying degrees. Currently, we are in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, which touches the souls of people. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between two classes and two roads, cannot but be reflected more sharply in the minds of each individual. In everyone's mind, there are various contradictions and conflicts. For example, the conflict between anti-private ownership and private ownership, between anti-exploitation and exploitation, between serving the people and serving oneself, between revolutionary self-sacrifice and the philosophy of "better to live miserably than to die well," between hard work and enjoyment, between being a student and servant of the people and being above the people and acting like a lord, and so on. All these conflicts ultimately boil down to the conflict between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. In a battle, there is always a winner and a loser. Either one overcomes the other, or the other overcomes it. To resolve these conflicts, one must, like Wang Daoming, thoroughly discard various ideological burdens, never be self-satisfied, and continuously advance, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to overcome non-proletarian thoughts in one's mind, and daring to engage in a life-and-death struggle with selfish thoughts.

Comrade Lin Biao emphasized, "The 'Three Articles' are not just for soldiers to study; cadres should also study them. The 'Three Articles' are easy to read, but it is not easy to truly apply them. They should be studied as a guiding principle. The entire Party, the entire nation, and the entire army must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, earnestly study the 'Three Articles,' learn and apply them in struggle, learn a little and apply a little, repeatedly learn and repeatedly apply, and work hard on transforming one's worldview and carrying out ideological revolutionization.

Transforming the Soul with Mao Zedong Thought
- Deputy Political Instructor Wang Daoming of the PLA Discusses Experiences in Studying and Applying the "Three Articles" to Transform Thought

Over the past few years, under the Party's guidance and the help of comrades, I have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, transformed my thoughts, and raised my class consciousness. I have come to understand some revolutionary truths. Below, I will discuss a few insights from my experience in studying and applying the "Three Articles" and other works by Chairman Mao to transform my thoughts.

There is no "red by birth," only "red by consciousness"

Previously, my self-awareness of transforming my thoughts was very low, and I did not want to hear the term "transforming thoughts." I always felt that our generation, having attended schools run by the Party and read books published in the new society, received Party education from a young age, grew up singing "The East Is Red" and wearing red scarves, had revolutionary thoughts from the start. My family is of poor peasant origin, and my father is a revolutionary cadre. I did not receive any bad thoughts, so I did not need to transform, thinking I was a naturally red youth, a naturally red revolutionary descendant, and that walking the revolutionary path was not a problem. At home, my father often told me, "Study Chairman Mao's works well and transform your thoughts, otherwise you will change and make mistakes." I thought these words were meant to scare me.

After joining the army, the leadership talked about transforming thoughts, and I initially did not understand. I thought I just wanted to be a good soldier, with progressive thoughts, and I did well in work, training, and production, often receiving praise. Why transform further?

However, later, some incidents in my mind created contradictions, making me feel that my original thoughts were wrong. For example, regarding military uniforms, I felt they were "not very artistic," and when issued cotton shoes, I felt the "big-toed shoes" were too ugly, sometimes preferring to wear liberation shoes and freeze my feet rather than wear the "big-toed shoes." Looking at the leaders and old comrades in the unit, they were satisfied with the military uniforms and "big-toed shoes." The leaders often told us about the hardships of past war years, educating us not to forget the past hardships and the people. Why was I dissatisfied with things that the leaders and old comrades were satisfied with? What was the problem? It was from such incidents that I began to feel that my thoughts indeed needed transformation. Relying solely on the consciousness developed from being immersed in the "sugar bowl" of socialism since childhood seemed insufficient.

I truly realized the importance of transforming thoughts and consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to transform myself after Chairman Mao called for learning from Comrade Lei Feng. I realized that Comrade Lei Feng was able to achieve extraordinary deeds because he actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, understood why he lived and for whom he served, and established a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people. Previously, I also studied the "Three Articles" and did some good deeds. However, I was far from being as selfless as Comrade Lei Feng, not paying attention to transforming my thoughts in every action, and not truly consciously achieving "living for others to have a better life." Learning from Lei Feng made me understand that to completely and thoroughly serve the people, one must completely and thoroughly eliminate selfish thoughts. A revolutionary not only fights against class enemies in society but also fights against the class enemies in one's own thoughts—selfish thoughts, resisting various non-proletarian thoughts, using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate revolutionary qualities, and making Chairman Mao's teachings on wholeheartedly serving the people the soul of one's being.

Later, the entire company used the small rectification method to study Chairman Mao's discussions on class and class struggle. Through self-examination, I further discovered that non-proletarian thoughts and old habits had a significant influence on me. For example, I previously thought that "learning physics, chemistry, and mathematics will make you fearless anywhere in the world" made sense. In school education, there were many poisons, and the idea of fame and wealth left an impression on my mind. This shows that in socialist society, there are indeed sharp and complex class struggles. In front of our generation, there are two teachers: the proletariat is our positive teacher, and the bourgeoisie is our negative teacher. If we do not consciously arm ourselves with proletarian thoughts, bourgeois thoughts will definitely sneak in.

With these questions in mind, I studied a passage from Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to transform themselves. The working class must continuously learn in work, gradually overcome their shortcomings, and never stop." Chairman Mao said that everyone needs to transform, which naturally includes me, a young person who grew up under the red flag. Chairman Mao said that the working class must overcome their shortcomings. What are my shortcomings? From many facts, I felt that the first thing to overcome is the "red by birth" thought that I do not need to transform.

Will the youth of the socialist era be "red by birth"? I realized that my previous idea of being red was a simple class sentiment, born from the feeling of happiness that socialism brought to individuals, from the thought of gratitude towards the Party and Chairman Mao. This simple class sentiment is unique to us workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and children of revolutionary cadres, and it is precious, allowing us to quickly accept Mao Zedong Thought. However, this simple class sentiment does not mean that one understands that socialist society is not just for individual happiness but for the happiness of the entire proletariat and working people. Without raising simple class sentiment to conscious class awareness, one cannot resist the infiltration of bourgeois thoughts. Once it is necessary to sacrifice personal interests for the majority, one will not be able to withstand the test. One must not be satisfied with having simple class sentiment but must raise it to conscious class awareness and Mao Zedong Thought awareness. This requires actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to transform thoughts. Only "red by consciousness" exists; there is no such thing as "red by birth." I am currently in my youth and must read Chairman Mao's books well, set the direction of why I live and for whom I serve, consciously arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, and lay a good foundation for walking the revolutionary path for life.

Transforming oneself according to the standard of a new communist

After clarifying the need for conscious self-transformation, I began to seriously study and apply the "Three Articles" and other works by Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to work hard on transforming thoughts and solving worldview issues. Over the past few years, I have continuously solved some problems by addressing my active thoughts.

(1) Personal interests and revolutionary needs

I have loved drawing since I was young, and when I graduated from the art middle school and joined the army, I still carried a drawing board. Upon arriving at the unit, I was attracted by the boiling life, feeling that I had finally found the richest source of creation, wanting to create some famous paintings. I suggested to the leader that we draw the unit's history, and the leader strongly supported it. However, just as I was about to start drawing, the organization called me to the training camp to study military affairs. At that time, I did not understand and wanted to draw, so I asked if I could not go to study. The deputy political commissar saw that I did not understand and talked to me, sharing his personal experience. He said that before joining the revolution, he was a lathe operator. He said that in the old society, even if poor people had skills, they still had no food to eat and could not live, so he joined the revolution. After joining the revolution, he wanted to do technical work, but at that time, the revolution needed him to pick up a gun to eliminate the enemy, so he picked up a gun. If we all emphasize personal interests and expertise, not serving the revolutionary needs, where would today's victory come from? He told me to study the "Three Articles" well. After studying, I felt that although Comrade Bai Qiu'en had medical skills, he never cared about personal fame and position, always serving the revolutionary needs, and ultimately sacrificing his life for the Chinese revolution. Why couldn't I consciously serve the revolutionary needs with my interest in drawing?

After understanding, I happily went to the training camp to study. However, the original thoughts were not overcome in an instant and kept popping up. Personal interests must completely serve revolutionary needs, which requires repeated ideological struggles. For example, hearing that someone in the class drew a good painting or went to study a profession, my thoughts would fluctuate. Every time this happened, I would study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and Chairman Mao's teachings on wholeheartedly serving the people, using revolutionary needs to replace personal interests. I thought that in our country, personal interests and hobbies have ample room for development. However, this does not mean that we should leave the Party's needs and the purpose of serving the people to develop personal interests and hobbies. Instead, we should learn various skills to serve the people. If we leave revolutionary needs to develop personal interests and professions, we will become bourgeois individualists. Realizing this, my thoughts became more stable when hearing such things. No matter what the organization asked me to do, I could consciously obey and strive to do it well. At the same time, I did not give up drawing. In the company, I actively created blackboard newspapers, wrote slogans, and drew good deeds. From this, I understood that for the revolutionary needs, personal interests can be fully utilized and serve the revolution. Without revolutionary needs, personal interests can only serve oneself, even serving the enemy.

(2) Planting trees and enjoying shade

Previously, I always felt that I was born in good times, witnessing socialism. As the saying goes, "The predecessors plant trees, and the successors enjoy the shade." Revolutionary predecessors endured so much hardship, planting trees for us and conquering the world, so that we, the later generations, could live happily. We are the generation enjoying the shade and happiness. At home, I did not wear clothes with patches, and once my mother used my father's old clothes to make me a jacket, I disliked it and did not want it. After joining the army, for a period, I always felt that life was not as comfortable as at home.

One Sunday, I went to the regiment commander's house to deliver a letter. Upon entering, I saw the regiment commander mending shoes at home, mending the children's shoes, and then his own, with his own mending tools. I thought that these old leaders, who had experienced life and death in the past, still had a strong revolutionary spirit, living frugally and working diligently, often going to the companies and training with the soldiers to cultivate the revolutionary younger generation, sparing no effort. Especially seeing Chairman Mao's photo in Shaanxi, wearing patched cotton pants, I was deeply moved. Thus, I gradually felt that my previous thoughts were wrong. Revolutionary predecessors, at our age, had already shouldered the revolutionary burden and fought in blood. They thought of class liberation and national liberation. Now they think of how to carry the proletarian revolutionary cause to the end. They still maintain the spirit of hard struggle. However, I only thought of personal enjoyment.

Why did I have the thought of only enjoying the shade and not planting trees? I studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Many young people, due to lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing old China and new China, and cannot deeply understand how our people have endured countless hardships to struggle free from the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and how to build a beautiful socialist society through long-term hard work." Chairman Mao's words greatly shocked my thoughts. I forgot that our happy life was exchanged with the blood and sacrifices of many people, forgot that our country was still a poor and backward country, and forgot my responsibilities. Thinking of this, I felt that I had no reason to enjoy and relax. I further thought, what is happiness? Different classes have different views. The proletarian view of happiness is struggle, revolution, labor, and serving the people. Comrades Bai Qiu'en, Zhang Zide, and Lei Feng are the best examples. I should be like them, taking wholeheartedly serving the people as the greatest enjoyment and happiness.

After this, in practice, I paid attention to cultivating my thoughts of putting the public first, the collective first, enduring hardships first, and enjoying later. Sometimes I wanted to send money home, but seeing that other comrades' families needed it more, I sent it to them. When eating, if there were coarse grains and fine grains, I would eat the coarse grains first. During night marches, I always scouted the path ahead, willing to take a few more falls to ensure the path was clear for everyone. Through repeated ideological struggles and practical training, my feelings gradually changed. I understood that only when one truly understands what is hardship and what is happiness, and establishes a proletarian view of happiness, is one the happiest person. Those bound by bourgeois individualism, with heavy selfish thoughts, can never be happy. We are indeed enjoying the happy life exchanged with the blood and sacrifices of revolutionary predecessors, indeed enjoying the shade. However, we cannot just be those who enjoy the shade but must first be those who plant trees. A revolutionary must always be a tree planter, making the people of the world enjoy the shade of socialism and communism.

(3) Defending the country and making revolution

In August 1962, when I joined the army, it was when the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to invade the mainland. At that time, I thought, we must not let these beasts ride on our heads again. I am the son of a poor peasant and a child of a revolutionary cadre. Defending the motherland and happy life is our duty. After joining the unit, I always thought of fighting, often asking when we would go to the front line. Later, hearing that the Kuomintang reactionaries did not dare to come, I told the leader, "If there is no war, I will go home first and come back when there is a war." The leader asked me, "Why did you join the army?" I said, "To defend the motherland." The leader asked, "What else?" I could not answer. In my heart, I thought, what else? The revolutionary predecessors have built the country, and we, this generation, just need to guard it. What other tasks are there? The leader seemed to see through my thoughts and said to me, "There are still many laboring people in the world suffering oppression and exploitation. We not only need to defend the motherland but also support the world revolution. The country built by revolutionary predecessors is not just for us to guard but to make it play the role of a revolutionary base. As long as imperialism exists, war is inevitable. You, this generation, will have battles to fight. To fight a battle, the most important thing is to always have the oppressed and unliberated people in mind, the American imperialists and reactionaries of various countries. Learn from Bai Qiu'en."

After the leader's talk, I opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and read, "We must unite with the proletariat of all capitalist countries, liberate our nation and people, and liberate the people of the world." Chairman Mao also taught us to learn from Comrade Bai Qiu'en's selfless spirit, treating the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause, the internationalist spirit, and communist spirit. This made me realize that the liberation cause of the proletariat has always been international. Comrade Bai Qiu'en treated the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause, and I should treat the liberation of other peoples as my own cause.

Later, the company organized a remembrance of bitterness. I repeatedly thought, why were the landlords and capitalists in the old society so cruel in exploiting and oppressing workers and peasants? Studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood that originally, the landlords and capitalists had the Kuomintang reactionaries protecting them, and the Kuomintang reactionaries had American imperialism backing them. American imperialism supported the Kuomintang reactionaries in massacring the Chinese people in the past and is now massacring the Vietnamese people, supporting the reactionaries of various countries in massacring the people of various countries. What is the reason? Originally, American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries are all protecting the interests of landlords and capitalists, so they are all in cahoots, oppressing and exploiting the people, not allowing the people to rise up in revolution, and not letting the people seek liberation. American imperialism is the common scourge of the world's people today. As long as American imperialism exists, the world's people cannot obtain final liberation, and our victory is not secure. Our generation's task is not only to defend China's socialist mountains and rivers but also to support the world people's revolution, realize communism, and definitely become internationalist warriors like Bai Qiu'en.

With the thought of making revolution for the world's people, my requirements for myself are different, and my work enthusiasm is also different. In daily life, I fiercely fight against my selfish thoughts, sometimes even thinking about whether I thought of others when eating a meal. Last year, during bayonet training, some comrades did not want to train, saying that bayonets are useless in modern warfare. I organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's people's war thoughts, establishing confidence, and everyone said that we should use "bayonets to defeat atomic bombs," always ready to support the world people's revolutionary struggle.

(4) Sunlight and seedlings

Last year, after "Discussing Bayonet Training" and "Discussing How Our Class Grappled with Active Thoughts" were published in the newspaper, many leaders and comrades wrote to encourage me. At that time, I felt that I was facing the problem of how to pass the honor test. At that time, my active thoughts were many, fearing that others would say I was arrogant, sometimes even thinking about whether saying a word would have problems, fearing that I would say the wrong thing and be called arrogant. But again, I thought, wouldn't this make me a cautious gentleman? I still had to say what needed to be said. Sometimes I also feared exposing my shortcomings. At the end of last year, a leader wanted to see our Eighth Platoon and Third Platoon bayonet practice and asked me to participate. At that time, I was reporting to the military and had not practiced bayonets for a long time, fearing that I would not do well, so I did not want to go. But again, I thought this thought was wrong and went. After these incidents, I repeatedly thought, why did I keep thinking about "me" after achieving honor? Originally, after achieving honor, the word "fear" in my mind increased, and the essence of "fear" is "self." I was not afraid to expose my shortcomings in the past, obtain help, and make progress. Now, fearing to expose shortcomings is actually a face-saving thought. This bad selfish thought needs to be fiercely fought against.

At the beginning of this year, after reporting to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, I kept a ticket in my notebook. After returning, many comrades looked at it. At that time, it attracted my attention. In the past, when I reported elsewhere, I never kept anything, but this time, why did I keep a ticket? Was it to let comrades know that I had reported in the Great Hall of the People? I felt that the essence of the problem was this. I secretly tore off the upper half of the printed words on the ticket, leaving a small blank space at the bottom, writing "Fight against selfishness with a bayonet," using it to warn against bad thoughts.

I thought about this for a long time. I thought, how to view one's own learning achievements, how to view the honor given by the Party, this is the key to passing the honor test well. When I first started studying Chairman Mao's works, I did not know how to bring questions, did not know how to use, did not know how to summarize, and it was the leaders and comrades who helped me find problems, helped me use, helped me summarize. I made progress in learning, received encouragement, and immediately obtained help when I had shortcomings. My growth was inseparable from the great Mao Zedong Thought, just like a young seedling growing into a harvested crop, inseparable from the sun. When the crop is harvested, people often easily only discuss how good the crop is. After I made progress in learning, people easily only saw how good I was, giving me a lot of encouragement. In fact, I knew in my heart. I was just a very young seedling, able to grow into a crop, all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal red sun in my heart. I must always see myself as a seedling that cannot live without the sun for a moment.

After this, when encountering problems, I had a bit more self-awareness. For example, sometimes I returned late from an outing to the canteen to eat, and there were leftover dishes and rice that could be eaten, but the cook insisted on making new food. I insisted on not letting them make it and ate the leftovers. I love green onions, and sometimes the cook would give me a few, but I insisted on not eating them. I thought that the cook wanted to make food for me and give me green onions, which was their care for me, but I could not accept it, accepting it would mean acknowledging my specialness, different from the masses. Some comrades made progress in their thoughts, and they often said, "My progress is thanks to Wang Daoming's help." After hearing these words, I strictly examined myself in my work to see if there were phenomena of emphasizing the individual. On one hand, I organized the core members to talk with these comrades, letting these comrades not only report to me but also to the Party branch or other Party members, doing work absolutely not emphasizing the individual, not seeking personal gain.

Chairman Mao said, "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant. Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind, we must always remember this truth." He also said, "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life and not do bad deeds." He taught us to struggle hard for decades like one day. I thought, I have made some progress in studying Chairman Mao's works, but I absolutely cannot rely on this progress for life. The revolutionary road is still long, and the road of life is still long. Living a life means revolutionizing a life, transforming a life, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works for life. Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionizing for life. Achievements and honors, in the eyes of those with bourgeois individualist thoughts, are gold-plated signs, capital for personal gain and enjoyment, the endpoint of progress. Proletarian warriors absolutely do not lie on achievements and honors. In the eyes of proletarian warriors, achievements and honors are encouragement and whips, the starting point for creating greater achievements for the Party, proposing new tasks for oneself, proposing higher requirements for one's ideological revolutionization, the starting point of progress.

Fighting against selfish thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought

I realized that to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, let Mao Zedong Thought take root in one's mind, the most important thing is to be good at using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against bourgeois thoughts in one's mind. Learn in struggle, apply in struggle, transform in struggle, grow in struggle. Only through continuous struggle can one continuously deepen the understanding of Chairman Mao's works, deepen the feelings for Chairman Mao's works, and have one's own insights. Otherwise, there will be no sweetness, and the learning effect will not be easy to consolidate. In the past, our Eighth Platoon summarized the struggle against selfish thoughts in one sentence: "Fight against selfish thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought." My insights are as follows:

(1) Memorize Chairman Mao's words, especially many basic viewpoints and some aphorisms. Once memorized, one can think of Chairman Mao's words when encountering problems. When I first started studying, I had problems but could not find the sayings immediately, sometimes finding the wrong ones, and some problems were not handled well. Later, I often studied, often applied, often memorized, and over time, I memorized them. Memorizing is not just storing them in the mind but embodying them in actions. Only by memorizing can one learn and apply at any time, making thoughts and actions more conscious.

(2) Create a "statue" for oneself, set a model for transforming thoughts. That is, clearly define what kind of person one wants to transform and train oneself to be, having an image of oneself in the future in one's mind. The image in my mind was shaped after studying the "Three Articles," and later, studying Lei Feng added the correct image of treating public and private matters. Listening to Chen Jinyuan's report added the image of being responsible for comrades' revolution for life. Every time I study a hero and an advanced individual, I add a standard for transforming my thoughts. In the company, I also have an "image." For example, the company commander's sense of responsibility and spirit of research, the political instructor's principles and combativeness, and a comrade who still works actively after being wronged. In fact, a person's mind always has an "image." A person always learns from and imitates another person and others. We must consciously learn from and imitate the image of revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought and fight against all bad images, driving out the bad images and firmly establishing the image of a communist warrior in one's mind.

(3) Be good at catching the fleeting thoughts in one's mind. We see, hear, and smell things, which will always produce some ideas in the mind. Usually, one must be good at catching these ideas that pop up at any time, seeing if they are correct, and whether they conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Only by being good at catching one's active thoughts can one learn with questions. For example, this year, once I and some other comrades reported to a unit, after the report, we had a discussion with the active learners of Chairman Mao's works in that unit. At the beginning, everyone said a lot of praise, and I had no bad thoughts. However, when the leading comrade sought everyone's opinions, hoping everyone would raise criticisms, my heart jumped, and I did not dare to raise my head, fearing that it would be directed at me. I immediately realized that this was a very bad thought and actively made a self-examination at the discussion meeting.

(4) Develop "thought film" every night. A person's ears, eyes, nose, and other organs are like the "shutter" of a camera. All objective external things that these organs can see, hear, and smell will leave impressions in the mind. Every night when I lie in bed, I think about and look at what is imprinted on the "thought negative." Good things are kept, and bad things are discarded. Use Chairman Mao's words to "develop" and wash away. If I cannot see clearly, I also ask others to help "enlarge." If one does not consciously do this, some bad thoughts will grow unknowingly.

(5) Guard every pass. At the beginning of this year, once I returned from an outing and reported my thoughts to the political instructor, it was already past ten in the evening. The political instructor wanted me to stay in the company, and the bed was already laid out. At first, I thought that although I was a platoon leader, I had not been in the platoon for a while, and staying in the company for a night would not have a bad influence. However, I thought again, this is an attitude of forgiving oneself, and if one gets used to this, apart from cultivating the bad habit of being special and detached from the masses, there is no benefit. One cannot use the excuse of no bad influence to indulge oneself, but must strictly require oneself in thoughts, not doing anything that is not beneficial to ideological revolutionization even once. Later, I still went back to the platoon to stay. I realized that bad thoughts and wrong thoughts often start from doing the first bad thing. One must guard the first pass, not letting bad thoughts and wrong thoughts open a breach from the first thing and enter one's mind. When forgiving oneself, it is lowering the requirements for ideological revolutionization, making thoughts slide downhill. One must not use any excuse to indulge one's wrong thoughts.

On the other hand, good thoughts and good styles are formed through long-term tempering, cultivated bit by bit over the years. One must not reject doing the first good thing and always be unsatisfied with doing one good thing. Good thoughts and good styles cannot be formed in one morning; one must be good at "accumulating" sparks of thought. When the sparks of thought accumulate, there will be a leap. A person's thoughts will undergo qualitative changes.

(6) Have the stubbornness of a revolutionary. To revolutionize, to transform and temper oneself into a new generation of communists, one must have a firm revolutionary will and firm revolutionary perseverance. Sometimes I have a bit of stubbornness, not thinking about bad thoughts, not doing bad things, using Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against my selfish thoughts, "forcing" myself to do good things. At this time, think more about Chairman Mao's teachings, think more about heroic and model figures, think more about one's future "image." I feel that this revolutionary stubbornness is good. Chairman Mao said, "Our Chinese nation has the spirit of fighting to the death with our enemies, the determination to restore the old on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand independently among the nations of the world." We must have the spirit, determination, and ability taught by Chairman Mao, fighting to the end with the "enemies" in our thoughts, transforming ourselves into strong communist warriors.

专栏：

    编者按：毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。王道明同志遵照毛主席的教导，认真学习“老三篇”，勇于在灵魂深处闹革命。他的经验和体会，对每一个同志都有教育意义。
    我们都生活在社会主义的新中国。我们的新社会，并不是从天上掉下来的，是从旧社会脱胎出来的。旧社会的影响，不但对老年人、中年人，甚至对年青的一代，都还不同程度地起着作用。目前，我们正处在触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命的急流之中。无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，不能不更尖锐地反映到每个人脑子里来。在每个人的头脑里，都存在着各种各样的对立和冲突。例如，反私有观念和私有观念的冲突，反剥削和剥削的冲突，一切为人民和一切为自己的冲突，为革命勇于自我牺牲和“好死不如赖活着”的活命哲学的冲突，艰苦朴素和贪图享受的冲突，甘当人民群众的小学生、勤务员和自居于群众之上、做官当老爷的冲突，等等。所有这一系列的冲突，归根到底，都是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的冲突。两军对战，总有胜负。不是这个克服那个，就是那个克服这个。要解决这些冲突，就要像王道明那样，彻底扔掉这样那样的思想包袱，永不自满，不断前进，不断地用毛泽东思想，克服头脑中的非无产阶级思想，在同私心杂念作斗争中，敢于刺刀见红。
    林彪同志强调指出：“老三篇”不但战士要学，干部也要学。“老三篇”最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。全党、全国、全军都要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，认真学习“老三篇”，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，学一点，用一点，反复学，反复用，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，搞好思想革命化。
    用毛泽东思想改造灵魂
    ——解放军某部副指导员王道明谈活学活用“老三篇”改造思想的体会
    几年来，我在党的教导和同志们的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，阶级觉悟有了一些提高，懂得了一些革命道理。下面谈谈我活学活用“老三篇”和毛主席其他著作，改造思想的几点体会。
    没有“自来红”，只有“自觉红”
    以前我思想改造的自觉性是很不高的，不愿意听“改造思想”这个词。总觉得我们这一代，上的学校是党办的，读的书是新社会出版的，从小就受到党的教育，是唱着《东方红》，带着红领巾长大的，革命的思想从小就有了。我家又是贫农出身，爸爸是革命干部，我的脑子里没有接受什么不好的思想，不需要改造，是生定了的红色青年，生定了的革命后代，走革命道路是没有问题的。在家时，爸爸常对我说：“要好好学习毛主席著作，好好改造思想，不然要变质，要犯错误。”我认为这些话是吓唬我的。
    入伍后，领导上讲要改造思想，开始我也想不通。我觉得自己一心想当个好战士，思想要求进步，工作、训练、生产我干得都不错，经常受表扬。还改造什么呢！
    可是，以后有一些事情在我思想上产生了矛盾，对自己原来的想法感到不对头。譬如，对军装，我感到设计得“不太艺术”，发棉鞋的时候，感到“大头鞋”太难看，有时上街宁肯冻着脚穿解放鞋，也不穿“大头鞋”。再看看部队的首长和老同志，他们对军装和“大头鞋”却很满意。首长还常给我们讲过去战争年代缺鞋少衣的情景，教育我们什么时候也不要忘记过去的艰苦生活，什么时候也不要忘记人民。为什么自己不满意的东西，首长和老同志满意？问题在哪里呢？就从这样的事情上，我开始感觉到自己思想上有些东西确实需要改造。单靠小时候从“社会主义糖罐里”泡出来的觉悟，看来是不够的。
    我真正认识到改造思想的重要，比较自觉地用毛泽东思想改造自己，是在毛主席号召“向雷锋同志学习”以后。我认识到雷锋同志所以能做出平凡而伟大的事迹，成为共产主义战士，最根本的是他活学活用毛主席著作，懂得了为什么活着，为谁服务，树立了全心全意为人民服务的世界观。以前，我也学习“老三篇”，也做过一些好事。但是远没有像雷锋同志那样毫不利己专门利人，没有像他那样在做每一件事的时候，注意改造自己的思想，没有真正自觉地做到“自己活着，就是为了使别人过得更美好”。学习雷锋使我懂得了，要做到完全彻底地为人民服务，就要完全彻底地挖掉私心杂念。一个革命者不但要同社会上的阶级敌人斗，也要同自己思想上的阶级敌人——私心杂念斗，抵制各种各样的非无产阶级思想，用毛泽东思想培养自己的革命品质，把毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导化为自己的灵魂。
    以后，全连用小整风的方法，学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述。经过检查，我进一步发现非无产阶级思想和旧的习惯势力在我身上远不是没有影响的。譬如，“学会数理化，走遍天下都不怕”这类话，我过去也觉得有道理。在学校受的教育中就有不少毒素，名利观念在思想上也有烙印。这说明，社会主义社会里确实还存在着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。在我们这一代面前，有两个教员，无产阶级是我们的正面教员，资产阶级是我们的反面教员。如果我们不自觉地用无产阶级思想武装自己，资产阶级思想就一定会钻进来。
    带着这些问题，我学习了毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中说的这样一段话：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造，……工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”毛主席说人人需要改造，当然包含我这样在红旗下长大的青年。毛主席说工人阶级必须克服自己的缺点。我的缺点是什么？从许多事实中，我感到要首先克服的就是认为自己不需要改造的“自来红”思想。
    社会主义时代的青年会不会自来红？我体会到过去自己认为的思想红，只是一种朴素的阶级感情，是从社会主义给个人带来了幸福的感觉上产生的，是从对党，对毛主席感恩的思想产生的。这种朴素的阶级感情，是我们工人、贫下中农和革命干部子弟所特有的，很宝贵，使我们能够较快地接受毛泽东思想。但是，这种朴素的阶级感情，并不等于已经懂得社会主义社会绝不只是为个人谋幸福，而是为整个无产阶级和劳动人民谋幸福。不把朴素的阶级感情提高到自觉的阶级觉悟，就不能抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。一旦为了多数人的利益，需要牺牲个人利益的时候，就会经不起考验。一个人决不能满足于自己有朴素的阶级感情，必须把朴素的阶级感情提高到自觉的阶级觉悟，提高到毛泽东思想的觉悟。这就要靠活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想。只有“自觉红”，绝没有什么“自来红”。自己正处在青年时期，要好好地读毛主席的书，把为什么活着、为谁服务的方向定正，自觉地用毛泽东思想武装起来，为一辈子走革命道路打个好基础。
    按照共产主义新人的标准改造自己
    明确了要自觉地改造自己，我开始认真活学活用“老三篇”和毛主席的其他著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，在改造思想、解决世界观的问题上狠下功夫。几年来，针对自己的活思想，不断地解决了一些问题。
    （一）个人兴趣和革命需要
    我从小爱画画，从美专附中毕业入伍的时候，还背着个画板。一到部队就被沸腾的生活吸引住了，感到这下子算找到了最丰富的创作源泉，想画出点有名堂的画来。我向首长建议把团史画出来，首长非常支持。可是刚要开始画的时候，组织上又叫我到教导营去学习军事。当时思想不通，想画画，就提出能不能不去学习。团副政委看我思想不通，就找我谈话，给我讲了他亲身的经历。他参加革命前是个车工。他说：在旧社会穷人有技术也没有用，也一样没饭吃，生活不下去就参加了革命。参加革命以后想搞技术工作，但是，当时革命最需要我的是拿起枪杆子消灭敌人，我就拿起了枪杆子。如果我们每个人都强调个人的兴趣，个人的专长，不服从革命的需要，哪里还有今天的胜利。他叫我好好学习“老三篇”。我学习以后，感到白求恩同志虽然有医疗技术，但是他从不计较个人名位，始终服从革命的需要，最后为中国革命牺牲了自己的生命。自己画画这点兴趣，为什么不能够自觉地服从革命的需要呢？
    想通了，我就愉快地到教导营学习去了。但是，原来的思想不是一下子就能克服的，还时时冒出来。个人兴趣要完全服从革命需要，要经过反复的思想斗争。譬如，听说同学中谁谁画了什么好画，谁谁去学专业去了，思想就有点波动。每当这时候，我就学习《纪念白求恩》，学习毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，用革命的需要来代替个人的兴趣。我想，在我们国家里，个人的兴趣和爱好，有充分发展的天地。但是，这决不是叫我们离开党的需要，离开为人民服务的目的，去发展个人的兴趣和爱好，而是要我们学会各种本领去为人民服务。如果离开革命的需要，去发展个人的兴趣、个人的专业，就要变为资产阶级个人主义者。认识到这一点以后，再听到什么，思想上就平稳多了。不管组织上叫我做什么，都能自觉服从，并且努力去做好。同时，画笔我也没丢，在连队我积极出黑板报，写标语，画好人好事。从这里我体会到：为了革命的需要，个人的兴趣才能充分发挥作用，才能为革命服务。离开革命的需要，个人兴趣只能为个人服务，甚至为敌人服务。
    （二）栽树和乘凉
    以前，我总觉得自己生在好时候，赶上了社会主义。俗话说：“前人栽树，后人乘凉”。革命前辈吃了那么多苦，给我们栽了树，打了天下，就是为了我们后代过幸福生活。我们这一代正是乘凉的时候，乐的时候。在家的时候，我不穿带补钉的衣服，有一次妈妈用爸爸的旧衣服给我改件上衣，我嫌旧不要。入伍后，有一段时间总是感到生活不如在家舒服。
    一个星期天，我到团长家去送信，一进门见团长在家修鞋，修完了孩子的，又修自己的，修鞋工具也是自备的。我想，这些老首长们过去出生入死，现在的革命精神，还像当年打仗一样旺盛，生活艰苦朴素，工作勤勤恳恳，经常下连队和战士一起出操上课，为了培养革命的年青一代，他们费尽了心血。特别是看到毛主席在陕北穿着带补钉的棉裤的照片，使我非常感动。这样，慢慢地感到以前的想法错了。革命老前辈在我们这样大年龄的时候，早已担起了革命的担子，在流血奋斗。他们心中想的是阶级解放、民族解放的大事。现在他们想的是怎样把无产阶级的革命事业进行到底。他们仍然保持艰苦奋斗的作风。可是，自己想的净是个人享受的小事。
    为什么会有光想“乘凉”、不想“栽树”的思想呢？我带着问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，而建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过怎样的长时间的艰苦劳动。”毛主席的话使我的思想受到极大的震动。我忘了我们的幸福生活是多少人流血牺牲换来的，忘了我们国家还是一个一穷二白的国家，忘了自己肩上的责任。想到这里，感到自己没有一点讲究享受和松懈斗志的理由。我进一步又想，什么是幸福？不同的阶级有不同的看法。无产阶级的幸福观是斗争、革命、劳动，是为人民服务。白求恩、张思德、雷锋等同志就是最好的榜样。自己应该像他们那样，把全心全意为人民服务当作最大的享受，最大的幸福。
    从这以后，在实践中我注意锻炼自己先公后私，先集体后自己，吃苦在前，享受在后的思想。有时想给家里寄钱，但是看到其他同志家庭更需要，就寄给了其他同志。吃饭的时候有粗粮，有细粮，就先吃粗粮。夜间行军的时候，我总在前面探路，宁愿自己多栽几个跟头，也给大家把路探好。这样经过反复的思想斗争和实践的锻炼，思想感情逐渐变了。我体会到，一个人只有在真正懂得了什么是苦，什么是乐，树立了无产阶级的幸福观以后，才是最幸福的人。被资产阶级个人主义束缚着的人，私心很重的人，个人欲望总也满足不了，这种人永远也没有幸福。我们现在确实在享受着革命先辈流血牺牲给我们换来的幸福生活，确实在“乘凉”。但是，我们不能只做一个乘凉人，而首先要做一个栽树人。一个革命者要永远做一个栽树人，使世界人民都乘上社会主义、共产主义的凉。
    （三）保江山和闹革命
    一九六二年八月我入伍的时候，正是蒋介石反动派企图窜犯大陆的时候，当时想：决不能让这些吃人的野兽再重新骑在我们的头上。我是贫农的儿子，是革命干部子弟，当兵保卫祖国、保卫幸福生活是应尽的天职。到部队以后，天天想打仗，经常问什么时候出发上前线。后来听说蒋介石反动派不敢来了，我就找首长说：“不打仗了，我先回家，等以后打仗了我再来。”首长问我：“你为什么当兵？”我说：“保卫祖国。”首长又问：“还有呢？”我答不上来。心里想：别的还为什么？革命前辈打下的江山，我们这一代把它看好就行啦，别的还有什么任务？首长像看透我的心思，对我说：“世界上还有许许多多的劳动人民还在受压迫、受剥削，我们不光是要保卫祖国，还要支援世界革命，革命前辈打下的江山不是让我们看好就行了，而是要叫它发挥革命根据地的作用。只要帝国主义存在，战争就不可避免。你们这一代仗是有得打的。要打仗，最重要的是脑子里要时时刻刻有被压迫的、没解放的人民，有美帝国主义和各国反动派。要学习白求恩。”
    首长谈话后，我翻开《纪念白求恩》一文，毛主席说：“我们要和一切资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来，……解放我们的民族和人民，解放世界的民族和人民。”又教导我们学习白求恩同志毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业的国际主义精神、共产主义精神。这使我认识到，无产阶级的解放事业从来就是国际性的，白求恩同志把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，我也要把别国人民的解放事业当作自己的事业。
    以后连队组织忆苦。我反复想：旧社会地主、资本家为什么敢那么凶恶地剥削和压迫工人、农民？学习了毛主席著作我明白了，原来地主、资本家有国民党反动派保护着，国民党反动派又有美帝国主义在撑腰。美帝国主义过去支持蒋介石反动派屠杀中国人民，今天又在屠杀越南人民，支持各国反动派屠杀各国人民，这是什么道理？原来美帝国主义和各国反动派都是保护地主、资本家利益的，所以它们都串连一气，欺压和剥削人民，不准人民起来革命，不让人民求得解放。美帝国主义是当前世界人民的总祸根。美帝国主义不消灭，世界人民就不能得到最后解放，我们的胜利也是不巩固的。我们这一代的任务，不单是保中国的社会主义江山，而且要支援世界人民革命，实现共产主义，一定要像白求恩那样，做一个国际主义战士。
    有了为世界人民闹革命的思想，对自己的要求就不一样了，工作的劲头也就不一样了。日常生活中，我狠斗自己的私心杂念，有时吃一顿饭吃一口菜也要想想是不是先想到别人。去年练刺杀时，有的同志不愿练，说刺杀在现代战争中没用，我就组织大家学习毛主席的人民战争思想，树立了信心，大家说，我们要用“拚刺刀打败原子弹”，随时准备支援世界人民的革命斗争。
    （四）阳光和禾苗
    去年，《谈谈练刺杀》和《谈谈我们班是怎样抓活思想的》在报纸上登出来以后，许多首长和同志的来信给了我很多鼓励，这时我感到自己面前摆着一个怎样过荣誉关的问题。当时，我的活思想是很多的，最怕别人说我骄傲了，有时说句话也想想是不是有问题，怕说错了话，人家说骄傲。但又想这不成了谨小慎微的君子了吗？该说还要说。有时又怕暴露缺点。去年年底，有位首长要看看我们八班和三班对刺，叫我也参加。当时我正在军里汇报，刺杀又很长时间没练了，怕刺不好，就不想去，但又想这种想法不对头，又去了。这几件事情发生以后，我反复想，为什么有了荣誉以后，老围着“我”字转起来了呢？原来，随着有了荣誉以后，脑子里的“怕”字多了，“怕”的实质是“私”字。我以前正是不怕暴露缺点，得到帮助，才有了进步的。现在怕暴露缺点，实际上是一种爱面子思想。对这种怕丑的私心，正需要狠狠地斗。
    今年年初，去北京人民大会堂汇报后，我把一张入场券夹在本子里了。回来后很多同志拿着看。当时引起了我思想上的注意。过去我到别处汇报，从来不留什么东西，这次为什么留下了一张票？是不是想让同志们知道自己在人民大会堂汇报过？我觉得实质上是这么个问题。我偷偷地把那张票上半部印的字撕掉，留下底下一小块空白，写上“向私心拚刺刀”，用它来警惕思想上不好的苗头。
    这件事我想了很久。我想：怎样看待自己的学习成绩，怎样看待党给的荣誉，这是能不能过好荣誉关的关键。我开始学习毛主席著作的时候，不会带问题，不知道怎样用，不知道怎样总结，也是首长和同志们帮助我找问题；帮助我用，帮助我总结；我学习有了成绩，就受到鼓励，有了缺点就立即得到帮助。我的成长，一点也离不开伟大的毛泽东思想，就像嫩小的禾苗长成丰收的庄稼，一点也离不开太阳一样。当庄稼丰收的时候，人们常常容易只议论庄稼如何如何好。当我学习有了成绩以后，人们容易只看到我如何如何好，给我很多鼓励。实际上我心里明白。我只不过是一棵很嫩小的禾苗，能长成庄稼，全靠毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是我心中永远不落的红太阳。我要永远把自己看成是一棵一刻也离不开太阳的禾苗。
    这以后，再遇到问题就有了点自觉性了，譬如，有时我外出回来晚了到伙房吃饭，本来有剩菜剩饭就可以吃了，炊事员偏要另做饭，我坚持不叫做，吃剩的。我爱吃大葱，吃饭的时候炊事员有时拿几棵，我也坚持不吃。我想炊事员要给我做饭，给我葱吃，这是他们对我的关心，但是自己决不能接受，接受了就等于承认自己特殊，可以和群众不一样了。还有的同志思想进步了，他们常常说：我的进步是王道明帮助的。我听到这些话以后，严格地检查自己在工作中是不是有突出个人的现象。一方面组织骨干和这些同志谈话，让这些同志不要光向我汇报，要向党小组或其他党员同志汇报，做工作绝不能突出个人，为自己捞个好。
    毛主席说：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”还说：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事”。教导我们要艰苦奋斗几十年如一日。我想，我现在学习毛主席著作有了点成绩，但是，绝不能靠这点成绩过一辈子。革命的道路还很长，一生的道路还很长，活一辈子，就要革命一辈子，改造一辈子，活学活用毛主席著作一辈子。靠毛泽东思想，一辈子走革命道路。成绩和荣誉，在具有资产阶级个人主义思想的人看来，是金字招牌，是为个人捞取地位享受的资本，是进步的终点。无产阶级战士绝不躺在成绩和荣誉上面。在无产阶级战士看来，成绩和荣誉，是鼓励和鞭策，是为党创造更大成绩的出发地，是给自己提出了新的任务，是给自己思想革命化提出了更高的要求，是进步的起点。
    用毛泽东思想同私心杂念“拚刺刀”
    我体会到，要学好用好毛主席著作，让毛泽东思想在自己的脑子里扎根，最重要的是要会运用毛泽东思想和自己脑子里的资产阶级思想斗。在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在斗争中改造，在斗争中成长。只有经过不断斗争，才能不断提高对毛主席著作的认识，加深对毛主席著作的感情，产生自己的体会。不然是不会有甜头的，学习成效也是不容易巩固的。过去我们八班把同私心作斗争概括为一句话，叫作“用毛泽东思想同私心杂念拚刺刀”。我的体会有以下几点：
    （一）对毛主席的话，特别是许多基本观点和有些警句要记熟。熟了，遇到问题就能想起毛主席的话。我开始学习的时候，有了问题，一时找不到语录，有时找的不对，有些问题就没有处理好。以后常学，常用，常记，天长日久，就背熟了。背熟了不是装在脑子里，而是体现在行动上。背熟了，才能随时学，随时用，思想和行动更自觉。
    （二）要给自己“塑像”，给自己订个改造思想的样板。就是明确要把自己改造锻炼成一个什么样的人，脑子里有个自己将来的“形象”。我脑子里的形象，是从学习“老三篇”以后塑起来的，后来学习雷锋，又增加了正确对待公和私的形象，听了陈金元的报告，增加了要对同志一辈子革命负责的形象。每学习一个英雄和先进人物，都给自己增加一条改造思想的标准。在连队我也有“形象”。譬如我们连长的工作责任心和钻研精神，指导员的原则性和斗争性，还有一个受了委屈仍然积极工作的同志。事实上一个人的脑子里总是有“形象”的。一个人总是在学习和模仿另一个人和另一些人。我们要自觉地学习和模仿革命的人，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人的形象，和一切不好的形象斗，把不好的形象挤出去，在自己的脑子里牢固地立起一个共产主义战士的形象。
    （三）要善于抓住脑子里一闪的念头。我们看到，听到，嗅到一些东西，总要在脑子里产生一些想法。平时就要善于抓住这些随时随地产生的想法，看它对不对头，符合不符合毛泽东思想。会抓自己的活思想，才会带着问题学。譬如，今年，有一次我和另一些同志在一个单位汇报，汇报后，和这个单位的学习毛主席著作积极分子座谈。开始大家说了很多赞扬的话，我没什么不好的想法。可是当带队的同志征求大家的意见，希望大家提出批评时，我的心里就跳起来了，头也不敢抬起来了，怕提到自己头上。我马上意识到这是一种极不好的念头，在座谈会上主动做了检查。
    （四）每天晚上冲“思想胶卷”。人的耳、眼、鼻这些器官就像照像机的“快门”。凡是这些器官能看到、听到、嗅到的客观外界的事物，都会在脑子里留下印象。我每天晚上躺在床上就要想想、看看“思想底版”上都印下了什么东西。好的就把它留下来，不好的就把它去掉。用毛主席的话来“定影”，来冲掉。自己看不清楚的，还请别人帮助“放大”。如果不自觉地去这样做，有些不好的思想，就会在不知不觉之中滋长起来。
    （五）把住每一个关口。今年年初，有一次我外出回来向指导员汇报思想情况，汇报完已经是晚上十点多了。指导员要留我在连部住，被子已经铺好了。开始觉得自己虽然是排长，但是前一段不在排里，在连部住一晚上也没啥不好的影响。但是又一想，这是原谅自己的态度，这样惯了，除了养成自己特殊、脱离群众的坏毛病以外，没什么好处。不能用没什么不好的影响来迁就自己，要从思想上严格要求自己，对思想革命化没益处的事一次也不能做。后来，我还是回排里去住了。我体会到，坏思想、错误思想，往往就是从做第一件不好的事情开始的，要把住第一次关，不让坏思想、错误思想从第一件事情上打开突破口，进入自己的脑子里。原谅自己的时候，就是降低了思想革命化的要求的时候，就是思想往下坡路走的时候。决不能以任何借口来迁就自己的错误思想。
    反过来，好思想、好作风也是长期磨炼形成的，靠成年累月一点一滴培养起来的。要不拒绝做第一件好事，又永远不满足于做一件好事。好思想、好作风不可能一个早上就形成，要善于“积累”思想的火花。思想火花“积累”多了，就会产生飞跃。一个人的思想就会起质的变化。
    （六）要有革命的“犟劲”。要革命，要把自己改造锻炼成共产主义的一代新人，没有坚强的革命决心，没有坚强的革命毅力是不行的。有时候我有点犟劲，不好的念头就是不去想，不好的事情就是不去做，用毛泽东思想去狠斗自己的私心杂念，“强迫”自己做好事。这种时候，多想毛主席的教导，多想英雄模范人物，多想自己将来的“形象”。我觉得这种革命的“犟劲”，是好的。毛主席说：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”我们就是要有毛主席教导的这种革命的气概、决心和能力，同自己思想上的“敌人”斗到底，把自己改造成为坚强的共产主义战士。
