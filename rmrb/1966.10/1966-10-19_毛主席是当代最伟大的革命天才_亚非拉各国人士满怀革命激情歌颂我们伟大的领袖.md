People from Asia, Africa, and Latin America have recently continued to make statements and write articles, expressing their fervent admiration for "Chairman Mao as the greatest revolutionary genius of our time, following Marx and Lenin." They praise "Mao Zedong Thought as the universal truth" and as "the most powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism and modern revisionism."

Chairman Mao is the Great Leader and Teacher of the World's Revolutionary People

A leader of a branch of the National Revolutionary Movement of Youth in Congo (Brazzaville), Supu, said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary genius of our time, following Marx and Lenin." He said, "Chairman Mao's revolutionary theories concretely embody the aspirations of the oppressed masses of the world and have already been applied by all genuine revolutionaries to strive for their own liberation."

The Deputy Chairman of the Ceylon Federation of Labor, T.N. Nadangoda, said that Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people. He said that Mao Zedong Thought has become the most precious treasure shared by the Chinese people and the people of the world. The people of the world, by mastering and applying Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon, will surely promote the great development of the world's revolutionary cause and thoroughly bury imperialism and its accomplices and running dogs.

A member of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Parliament, Donasyan Mounda, said: "Mao Zedong is the far-sighted, correct, and wise leader following Marx and Lenin. He not only cares about his own country but also about the socialist and proletarian victories of all countries in the world."

Mao Zedong Thought is the Beacon for the Revolutionary People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America

The Executive Committee member of the Myanmar Peace Committee, U Anza, said: "Chairman Mao is a great defender of Marxism-Leninism and a great inheritor of the Great October Revolution." He said, "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world."

The leader of the Lao Patriotic Forces News Delegation, Zalun Ongsang, who recently visited China, said: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates all of China but also reaches Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, increasingly penetrating people's hearts."

The Deputy Chairman of the All-Pakistan Labor Federation, Khan Bahatiar, said that since the Soviet revisionist leaders betrayed Marxism-Leninism, it is Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought that have guided the working people of the world to continue their struggle for liberation. Mao Zedong Thought embodies the aspirations of the world's working class today. He said, "Chairman Mao's works are the most important revolutionary truths of our time. To achieve final victory, the working class of all countries must follow the teachings of Mao Zedong."

A prominent figure from Mexico, Arenas, said: Chairman Mao has inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest Marxism-Leninism guiding the revolution of the people of the world today. He emphasized that all revolutionaries, the oppressed and exploited, should master Mao Zedong Thought and defend Mao Zedong Thought. They must not allow anyone to distort and slander Mao Zedong Thought in any way.

Mao Zedong Thought Guides the Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Colonial Struggles of the World's Revolutionary People

The manager of the Hofu branch of the Japanese "Long Weekly News," Kiku Takeharu, said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the developed Marxism-Leninism of our time. We must defend Mao Zedong Thought as the common wealth of the working people of the world." He said, "Today's China is the Yan'an of the world. China plays the role of a beacon for the progress and truth-seeking of the people of the world."

A friend from Iraq said: "Mao Zedong is the Marx and Lenin of our time. He is the closest comrade of the Arab people. Everything he thinks, says, and does is for one purpose, that is, to overthrow the old world of the bourgeoisie and build a new world of the proletariat." He also said, "The oppressed people of the world, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will follow the revolutionary path of China."

A journalist from Congo (Brazzaville), Banzi Jan, said that Mao Zedong Thought is inspiring and guiding the revolutionary people of all countries in the world to successfully carry out the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The best way for the people of Africa and Asia to learn from China is to study Mao Zedong Thought, because Mao Zedong Thought is the continuation and development of Marxism-Leninism.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Most Powerful Ideological Weapon to Defeat Imperialism and Revisionism

The General Secretary of a regional organization of the Sudanese Union Party in Mali said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the invincible weapon that will forever bury the true enemy of mankind—imperialism."

A member of the National Assembly of Pakistan, Rana Sabir Khan, said: "Chairman Mao Zedong is a great leader of our time. His teachings and thoughts have epoch-making significance in the struggle of the world's people against imperialism and colonialism and for a better future."

A young person from Ceylon said: "Why are the American imperialists and modern revisionists so afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought? Because Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon that the people will use to thoroughly bury American imperialism and modern revisionism. Therefore, today the people of all countries in the world pay tribute to the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, Chairman Mao."
