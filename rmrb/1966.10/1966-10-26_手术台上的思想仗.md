This spring, a comrade's young daughter was diagnosed with acute laryngitis and was brought to the medical unit. Her condition worsened rapidly, and antibiotics were no longer effective. Her breathing became increasingly difficult, and death was imminent. In this situation, the head of the medical unit ordered me to perform a tracheotomy immediately. Although I verbally agreed, I was hesitant: I had never performed such an operation before. If the trachea could not be opened or was damaged, causing the child to die, what would the consequences be for me? However, if the operation was not performed, there would be no hope, and the child would certainly die.

At that moment, my thoughts were in turmoil, torn between public duty and personal concerns. Past criticisms of doctors who shirked their responsibilities echoed in my mind: "Personal interests have overshadowed class feelings," "deserters on the battlefield." Now, these criticisms were directed at me! In this critical moment, the image of Comrade Norman Bethune, risking his life to save Chinese wounded soldiers under fire, appeared before me.

Chairman Mao said: "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication, his extreme responsibility to his work, and his extreme devotion to his comrades and the people, are qualities every Communist Party member should learn from."

Chairman Mao's great call gave me confidence and strength. As a doctor trained by the Party, how could I hesitate to save a life out of fear of personal risk? A Communist Party member should always prioritize the interests of the Party and the people. With this in mind, I could not afford to hesitate any longer. I summoned my courage and began the operation.

However, before I could open the trachea, the child's breathing stopped. At that moment, I had only one thought: to overcome all difficulties and save the child. I immediately performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and the medical staff provided oxygen and administered medication. After intense efforts, the child's breathing gradually returned. I then proceeded with the tracheotomy. After opening the trachea, blood and thick mucus again blocked the child's airway, and death threatened once more. I quickly cleared the mucus with my mouth, overcoming the lack of an electric suction device, and the child's breathing returned. Finally, I safely transferred the child to the hospital, where she received treatment and quickly recovered.

This battle to save the critically ill child made me realize: the operating table is a battlefield of ideological struggle. Chairman Mao's essays "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "On the Rectification of the Work Style of the Party" are the sharpest weapons for dismantling the fortress of bourgeois individualism.

"The Three Articles" are powerful! They enabled me to succeed in the operation!

    手术台上的思想仗
    解放军某部军医　赵传明
    今年春天，一位同志的小女孩患急性喉炎，来到了卫生队。她的病情发展得很快，抗菌素已经不能控制，呼吸也越来越困难，眼看死亡威胁着她的生命。在这种情况下，卫生队长叫我马上给她做气管切开手术。我嘴里虽然答应“是”，心里却犯了难：自己从来没做过这样的手术，一旦气管切不开或切坏了，造成病儿死亡，对“我”会有什么样的影响呢？可是，要是不动这次手术，那就连一线希望都没有了，病儿肯定马上就要死亡。
    在这一瞬间，我的思想斗争非常激烈，公与私两种思想就像拔河一样，东拉西拽。过去自己在兄弟医院进修的时候，也批评过有的医生逃避手术责任，是“私心夺去了对病人的阶级感情”，是“战场上的逃兵”。现在，这个批评却成了对自己的谴责！在这个紧急关头，白求恩同志冒着枪林弹雨抢救中国伤员的场面，又出现在我的眼前。
    毛主席说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”
    毛主席的伟大号召，给了我信心和力量。我是党一手培养起来的人民军医，怎么能怕担个人风险而见死不救呢？一个共产党员，应该以党和人民的利益为第一生命。想到这里，我觉得不能再有片刻的犹豫，就鼓足勇气，开始给病儿动手术。
    可是，还没来得及切开气管，病儿的呼吸却停止了。当时，我只有一个念头：下定决心，排除万难，治好病儿。于是，我就口对口地对病儿进行人工呼吸，卫生员们也尽全力给氧，注射药品。经过紧张的抢救，病儿逐渐恢复了呼吸。随后，我就动手做气管切开手术。当切开气管后，血和浓痰再次堵住了病儿的喉咙，死亡又一次威胁病儿。我马上用嘴吸出浓痰，克服了没有电动吸引器的困难，使病儿很快恢复了呼吸。最后，把病儿安全地护送到医院，经过治疗，很快就痊愈出院了。
    这次抢救急性病儿的战斗，使我认识到：手术台，就是一个思想斗争的战场。毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等三篇文章，就是攻垮资产阶级个人主义堡垒最锐利的武器。
    “老三篇”有无穷的威力，它使我手术成功了！
