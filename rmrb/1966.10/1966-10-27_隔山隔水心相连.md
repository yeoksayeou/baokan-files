Dear beloved border guards:

First of all, please accept our highest revolutionary salute!

We hold Chairman Mao in boundless admiration, love, and reverence. Each of us has a Chairman Mao badge. It truly shines on our chests and in our hearts.

With boundless excitement, we have read the letter expressing your feelings. Although we usually cherish the Chairman Mao badge like our eyes, never letting anything touch it, and always carefully taking it off and putting it back on when changing clothes, upon hearing that the most beloved border guards are eagerly hoping to obtain Chairman Mao badges, we all took the badges off our chests and sent them to you. Our countless words can be summed up in one sentence: We hope the badges reach you soon, so that our beloved border guards can see Chairman Mao every day and forever follow Chairman Mao forward through storms and waves!

Dear beloved border guards! You stand guard day and night on the borders of our motherland, while we, in the heart of our motherland—Beijing, are participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Though we are separated by mountains and rivers, we are all striving for the same goal. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely complete the combat tasks of "struggle, criticism, and reform" given to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and ensure that our red land will never change color!

The best words cannot express our feelings. Let us together, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the revolution through to the end!

A group of revolutionary youth in Beijing

    隔山隔水心相连敬爱的边防战士们：
    首先，请接受我们崇高的革命敬礼！
    我们对毛主席无限敬仰、无限热爱、无限崇拜。我们每人都有一枚毛主席像纪念章。真是戴在胸前，亮在心上。
    我们怀着无限激动的心情，读完了表达你们心情的信。同学们尽管平时像爱护眼睛一样爱护毛主席像纪念章，不让一点东西碰到它，每到换衣服时，总是小心翼翼地取下，再戴上。可是，听说最可爱的边防战士十分渴望得到毛主席像纪念章，同学们都纷纷把纪念章从胸前取下，寄给你们。同学们千言万语，归结为一句：但愿纪念章早一天飞到你们身边，使我们敬爱的边防战士天天能够看到毛主席，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进！
    敬爱的边防战士们！你们日夜守卫在祖国的边疆，我们在祖国的心脏——北京参加无产阶级文化大革命。我们相隔万水千山，都为着一个共同的目标而奋斗。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决完成党中央、毛主席交给我们的“一斗、二批、三改”的战斗任务，彻底挖掉修正主义根子，保证我们的红色江山永不变色！
    最好的语言也表达不完我们的心意。让我们共同在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，将革命进行到底！
    北京一群革命青年
