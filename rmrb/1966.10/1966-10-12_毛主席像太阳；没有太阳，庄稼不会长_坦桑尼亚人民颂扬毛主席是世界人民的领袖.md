Chairman Mao is like the sun; without the sun, crops will not grow
Tanzanian people praise Chairman Mao as the leader of the world's people

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, October 9th: "Chairman Mao is the true leader of the working people of the whole world!" "Not only do the Chinese people love Chairman Mao, but the people of the whole world also love Chairman Mao. The people of Africa especially love Chairman Mao." Tanzanian workers enthusiastically expressed these sentiments to convey their boundless love for our great leader, Chairman Mao.

During the exhibition of Chinese arts and crafts in the capital of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, a cleaning worker repeatedly came to visit. It turned out that he wanted to obtain a portrait of Chairman Mao. On his last visit, he mustered the courage to make his request to the Chinese staff. He said, "We African people love Chairman Mao... Chairman Mao is like the sun. Without the sun, crops will not grow. The achievements of the Chinese people are because you have a wise leader—Chairman Mao." He also said that he would take the portrait of Chairman Mao back home and hang it on the wall so that he and his family could see Chairman Mao every day.

Recently, a Tanzanian friend, upon hearing the news that Chairman Mao had received a million cultural revolution troops in Beijing, told a Chinese expert, "Chairman Mao is truly great. The people love Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao loves the people. Not only do the Chinese people love Chairman Mao, but the people of the whole world also love Chairman Mao. The people of Africa especially love Chairman Mao."

In July of this year, the news of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River reached Tanzania, and many Tanzanian friends were elated. They said that Chairman Mao's good health is a great happiness for the Chinese people and the people of the whole world. They sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life.

Some Tanzanian workers often enthusiastically ask Chinese workers and experts to teach them to sing "The East is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea" and other songs to express their deep respect for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

On the eve of China's National Day, Tanzanian workers at the construction site of the Friendship Textile Factory, which was built with the help of China, watched the color documentary "The East is Red," a revolutionary epic of Chinese music and dance. Tanzanian workers, who have similar experiences to the Chinese people, found the film's reflection of Chinese revolutionary history particularly familiar. When the red flag with Chairman Mao's portrait appeared on the screen, the more than 500 workers in the audience immediately applauded thunderously. An African warehouse keeper could not help but shout in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" After watching the movie, Tanzanian automobile worker Mannino vividly described China's past suffering by bending over and hunching his back, and then stood up straight and gave a thumbs up to symbolize the present of the Chinese people. He said, "Chairman Mao is truly wise!" "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of the African people."

A Tanzanian worker, after studying Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," was deeply moved. He wrote, "I love Chairman Mao Zedong. I love the Chinese brothers and friends under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the world revolution, Chairman Mao!"

    毛主席像太阳；没有太阳，庄稼不会长
    坦桑尼亚人民颂扬毛主席是世界人民的领袖
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆九日电　“毛主席是全世界劳动人民的真正领袖！”“不仅中国人民热爱毛主席，全世界人民也热爱毛主席。非洲人民特别热爱毛主席。”坦桑尼亚工人热情洋溢地用这些话来表达他们对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    在中国工艺美术展览会在坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆展出期间，一位清洁工人一次又一次前来参观，原来他想得到一张毛主席像。最后一次，他鼓起勇气向中国工作人员提出了他的要求。他说：“我们非洲人民热爱毛主席……毛主席像太阳。没有太阳，庄稼不会长。中国人民取得的成就是因为你们有英明的领袖——毛主席。”他还说，他将把毛主席像带回家里，挂在墙上，让他和他的家人能天天看到毛主席。
    最近，一位坦桑尼亚朋友在听到毛主席在北京接见百万文化革命大军的消息后，他对中国专家说：“毛主席真是伟大。人民热爱毛主席，毛主席热爱人民。不仅中国人民热爱毛主席，全世界人民也热爱毛主席。非洲人民特别热爱毛主席。”
    今年七月，毛主席畅游长江的消息传到坦桑尼亚，许多坦桑尼亚朋友欢欣鼓舞。他们说，毛主席身体健康是中国人民和全世界人民的极大幸福。他们衷心祝毛主席万寿无疆。
    一些坦桑尼亚工人还常常热情要求中国工人和专家教他们唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，以表达他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席深深的敬爱。
    中国国庆节前夕，坦桑尼亚工人在中国帮助建设的友谊纺织厂修建工地上，观看了中国音乐舞蹈革命史诗彩色纪录片《东方红》。有着与中国人民相似经历的坦桑尼亚的工人，对影片反映的中国革命历史感到特别亲切。当有毛主席像的红旗在银幕上出现时，全场五百多名工人观众立即报以雷鸣般的掌声。一位非洲仓库保管员情不自禁地用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”看完电影后，坦桑尼亚汽车工人曼尼诺很形象地以弯腰曲背来形容中国苦难的过去，然后又挺起胸膛、翘起大拇指以象征中国人民的现在。他说：“毛主席真英明！”“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是非洲人民的伟大领袖。”
    坦桑尼亚一位工人学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》一文后，很受感动。他写道：“我热爱毛泽东主席。我热爱在毛主席领导下的中国兄弟和朋友。中国人民和世界革命的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
