The People's Liberation Army always stands shoulder to shoulder with the people, humbly learning from them. This is a scene of soldiers from a certain unit listening to poor peasants recalling their hardships and joys, learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants' clear class stance in class struggle, and their revolutionary spirit of hard work in production struggle.
