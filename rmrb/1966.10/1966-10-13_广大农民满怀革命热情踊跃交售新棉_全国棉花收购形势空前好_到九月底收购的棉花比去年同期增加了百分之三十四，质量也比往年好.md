The broad masses of farmers, filled with revolutionary zeal, are enthusiastically selling their new cotton. The national cotton procurement situation is exceptionally good. By the end of September, the amount of cotton procured increased by 34 percent compared to the same period last year, and the quality is also better than in previous years.

Poor and lower-middle peasants say: Selling one more pound of cotton to the state is adding one more bit of strength to the Cultural Revolution, letting those capitalist-roaders see how we love the Party, love socialism, and love our great leader Chairman Mao!

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th, under the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this year's national cotton procurement has seen an unprecedented good situation. Currently, both the southern and northern cotton-producing areas have entered the peak of cotton procurement. Thousands of procurement stations are bustling with activity, with people and horses cheering, and drums and gongs resonating. Batch after batch of community members, driving carts loaded with pure white cotton, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, beating drums and gongs, are selling their new cotton to the state. By the end of September, the amount of cotton procured nationwide has increased by 34 percent compared to the same period last year. In key cotton-producing areas such as Hubei, Jiangsu, Henan, and Shanghai, the procurement volume has increased by more than onefold compared to the same period last year. The quality of cotton is generally better than in previous years.

This year's cotton procurement peak started in mid-September from the cotton-producing areas along the Yangtze River and is now gradually spreading to the northern provinces. Relevant departments believe that this year's procurement peak came so early and lasted so long, which is a rare new situation since the founding of New China. This is the result of cadres, community members, and the broad masses of staff in the supply and marketing cooperatives across the country studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting revolution, and advancing production. It is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Since this year, the broad masses of cadres and community members in the cotton-producing areas of our country, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people," have carried forward the spirit of "farming for revolution," overcoming natural disasters in various ways, and achieving a bumper cotton harvest. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched, the political enthusiasm of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants has soared even higher. They say: Every pound of cotton we sell to the state is adding one more bit of strength to the Cultural Revolution, letting those capitalist-roaders see how we poor and lower-middle peasants love the Party, love socialism, and love our great leader Chairman Mao!

The staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives across the country generally regard the cotton procurement stations as a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Special reading rooms for Chairman Mao's works and loudspeakers are set up in the stations, using various forms to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the community members, and to propagate the Party's policies and state affairs. These activities are warmly welcomed by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Some community members wrote in the comment book: You are so actively helping us study Chairman Mao's works, which is the greatest care for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will definitely farm well in the future and strive to sell more and better cotton to the state.

    广大农民满怀革命热情踊跃交售新棉
    全国棉花收购形势空前好
    到九月底收购的棉花比去年同期增加了百分之三十四，质量也比往年好
    贫下中农说：向国家多卖一斤棉花，就是为文化大革命多添一分力量，让那些资产阶级右派分子看看我们是怎样热爱党，热爱社会主义，热爱伟大领袖毛主席的！
    据新华社十二日讯  在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，今年全国的棉花收购出现了空前未有的大好形势。目前，南北棉区都已进入棉花收购高潮。成千上万个收购站前，终日人欢马叫，锣鼓喧天。一批又一批的社员，赶着满载洁白棉花的大车，高举毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓，向国家交售新棉。到九月底，全国已经收购的棉花比去年同期增加了百分之三十四，其中湖北、江苏、河南、上海等重点产棉区，收购量都比去年同期增加一倍以上。棉花质量一般也都比往年好。
    今年的棉花收购高潮，是九月中旬从长江流域的各产棉区开始的，目前正逐渐向北方各省发展。有关部门认为，今年的收购高潮来得这样早，持续的时间这样长，是新中国成立以来少有的新形势。这是各地广大干部和社员以及供销社的广大职工活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产的结果，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    今年以来，我国广大棉区的干部和社员，根据毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的指示，发扬“为革命种田”的精神，千方百计克服自然灾害，夺得了棉花丰收。无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，广大贫下中农政治热情更加高涨。他们说：我们向国家多卖一斤棉花，就是为文化大革命多增添一分力量，让那些资产阶级右派分子看看我们贫下中农是怎样热爱党，热爱社会主义，热爱伟大领袖毛主席的！
    各地供销合作社的职工，普遍把棉花收购站当成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，站里专门设立了毛主席著作阅览室，装了广播喇叭，运用各种形式，向社员宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策和国家大事。这些活动受到广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。有的社员在留言簿上写道：你们这样积极帮助我们学习毛主席著作，是对我们贫下中农的最大关怀。我们今后一定要种好棉花，争取把更多更好的棉花卖给国家。
