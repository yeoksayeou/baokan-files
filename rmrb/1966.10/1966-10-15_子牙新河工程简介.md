The Zi Ya River is formed by the confluence of the Huan Yang River and the Hu Tuo River in Xian County, Hebei Province. The Zi Ya River is one of the five major water systems of the Hai River. The drainage area above Xian County covers over 50,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 13 million people and over 35 million acres of cultivated land. The Zi Ya River basin on both sides of the Taihang Mountains is an area with frequent summer and autumn storms. When heavy rains occur, the floods from the upstream Huan Yang and Hu Tuo Rivers are significant, but the Zi Ya River's flood discharge capacity is limited. Once the Zi Ya River overflows, the areas south of Tianjin in Hebei Province become a vast expanse of water, posing a significant threat to Tianjin City and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

The Zi Ya New River Project involves constructing a new channel from Xian County eastward, passing through Qing County and Cangzhou City between the South Canal and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and directly into the sea at Qikou in Beidaihe. The design of the Zi Ya New River includes building two parallel dikes from Xian County to the sea, forming a wide flood discharge channel between the north and south dikes. The width between the two dikes is generally 2.5 kilometers, and it widens to 3.6 kilometers near the sea. This wide flood discharge channel can effectively discharge even the largest floods, such as the one in 1963, into the sea. This channel is primarily used for flood discharge during major floods, allowing the vast farmlands within the dikes to be cultivated as usual. The main roads within the dikes will be reinforced to ensure smooth traffic after flood discharge. In addition to this flood discharge channel, a deeper river channel with a capacity of 300 cubic meters per second will be excavated along the northern dike for regular water flow and navigation. A smaller drainage channel will also be excavated along the southern dike. Furthermore, three large-scale hub projects and other water gates and bridges will be constructed in Xian County, where the new river crosses the canal, and at the sea entrance. The entire project is of significant scale.

Upon completion, the Zi Ya New River Project will form a 300-kilometer-long flood control barrier from Shijiazhuang in the west to the sea entrance in the east, along the northern dikes of the Hu Tuo River and the new river. The drainage capacity of the Heilonggang basin will also be further enhanced. This will not only ensure the safety of Tianjin, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and the broader region but also lay a solid foundation for stable and high agricultural production in this vast area.

    子牙新河工程简介
    河北省的滏阳河和滹沱河在献县合流后称子牙河。子牙河是海河五大水系之一，献县以上的流域面积达五万多平方公里，流域内人口约一千三百多万，有耕地三千五百多万亩。太行山两侧的子牙河流域是一个夏秋暴雨很多的地区，一遇暴雨，上游滏阳、滹沱两河来洪很大，而子牙河泄洪能力很小，子牙河洪水一旦出槽，河北省天津以南地区就会变成一片汪洋，对天津市和津浦铁路的威胁极大。子牙新河工程是从献县向东，在青县和沧州市之间穿过南运河和津浦铁路，给子牙河再开辟一条由北大港的祁口直接入海的、长一百四十三公里的新河道。
    子牙新河的设计，是从献县到海口筑平行的两条堤，由南北两堤形成一条开阔的行洪道。两堤之间一般宽二点五公里，入海一段宽三点六公里。这样宽阔的行洪道，即使再遇一九六三年一样的大洪水，也能顺利宣泄入海。这条行洪道只备特大洪水时行洪，堤内滩地上的广大农田，仍可照常耕种。堤内主要公路的路面要加固，以免行洪后影响交通。全部新河工程除这条行洪道以外，北堤内傍堤要开挖一条可通过三百秒立米流量的较深的河槽，这是将来子牙新河平时的主要河槽，可以通航。南堤内傍堤也将开挖一条较小的排水河。此外，在献县、在新河穿过运河的地方和入海的地方，还将修建三处规模巨大的枢纽工程，和其他一些水闸和桥梁。整个工程规模是很大的。
    子牙新河工程完成后，滹沱河北堤和新河北堤，形成西起石家庄东到新河海口长达三百公里的一道防洪屏障。黑龙港流域的排涝能力也将进一步加强。这不仅保障了天津、津浦铁路和广大地区的安全，还将为这个广大地区的农田稳产高产打下巩固的基础。
