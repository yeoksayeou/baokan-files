Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth of the proletariat tested through long-term revolutionary struggles, the most practical Marxism-Leninism, and the unified action guideline for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation. It must be thoroughly implemented throughout the Party, the army, and the people of the entire nation, and Mao Zedong Thought must be used to unify our thinking.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, Comrade Lin Biao's recent call to elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage reached the Daqing Oilfield. The vast number of workers and their families immediately launched a wave of study and discussion. They unanimously expressed that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are not only applicable to the entire army but also to the entire Party and the people of the entire nation. Daqing has always taken the People's Liberation Army as its learning example. Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the army are also instructions to Daqing. They said that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are extremely important and timely, providing a clear direction for deepening the study of Chairman Mao's works and playing a great role in promoting the current Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth of the proletariat tested through long-term revolutionary struggles, the most practical Marxism-Leninism, and the unified action guideline for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation. It must be thoroughly implemented throughout the Party, the army, and the people of the entire nation, and Mao Zedong Thought must be used to unify our thinking." The people of Daqing unanimously agreed that Comrade Lin Biao's words are absolutely correct and perfectly resonate with the hearts of the people of Daqing.

The "Iron Man" of Daqing, Wang Jinxi, said: I have been in Daqing for nearly seven years. During these years, we have always held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. We have limitless love, loyalty, and faith in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all our work. In the three great revolutionary movements, we have won victory after victory. As the saying goes, "Three people with one heart can turn yellow soil into gold." With Mao Zedong Thought, the seven hundred million people of the entire nation have a unified thought, and the power is boundless, even greater than the power of an atomic bomb. I was away from Daqing for more than a month, and when I returned, I saw that the oilfield had undergone many changes. The 1202 and 1205 drilling teams, which had drilled over fifty thousand meters when I left, have now broken through the seventy-thousand-meter mark. Such a fast drilling speed has left imperialism and revisionism far behind. This victory is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of the drilling workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The workers and families of Daqing have repeatedly studied the part in Comrade Lin Biao's instructions where he mentioned that "the army must truly become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought." They expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the new situation, to make the greatest effort to master Mao Zedong Thought, and to truly turn Daqing into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The model families Lin Shuhua and Du Hengai said: The workers and families of Daqing are advancing courageously on the great path of turning every industry into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, under the guidance of Chairman Mao. We families not only engage in agriculture but also participate in the industrial production of the oilfield and have set up some small factories. During the Cultural Revolution, we also take up the pen with the workers to criticize the bourgeoisie.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed: "Although the work situation of the entire army is very complex, with various different situations, in this regard, it is both complex and not complex, both different and not different, which is to unify everything with Mao Zedong Thought." The people of Daqing have proven with their own experiences that Comrade Lin Biao's instruction is absolutely correct. The model worker of the Petroleum Industry Department, Deputy Commander Huang Yanying of the Third Construction Team of the Daqing Refining Construction Command, said: Our work in Daqing is also very complex, with very different working conditions. There are those who work on surface construction and those who study underground oil layers. The work is varied and numerous. What should we grasp? The most fundamental thing is to grasp the education of Mao Zedong Thought and to emphasize proletarian politics. Production is like fighting a battle for the PLA, relying on people's consciousness, courage, political factors, and ultimately, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The model worker of the Petroleum Industry Department, Drilling Team Leader Hu Falian of the Comprehensive Team Four of the First Oil Extraction Department, said: Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that the "Three Articles" are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them. We should study the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles. In the process of my study, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" are still fresh even after reading them thousands of times. To establish a firm proletarian revolutionary worldview, one must work hard on the "Three Articles." Because every day there are new contradictions in one's thoughts, new difficulties in production, and new problems in work. Only by using the "Three Articles" as a weapon to transform one's thoughts and eliminate selfish and impure thoughts can one do the work well.

The workers and families of Daqing resolutely expressed their determination to repeatedly study and seriously understand Comrade Lin Biao's instructions and implement them in action. They said that Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms and best student. He studies Chairman Mao's works the best, applies them the most actively, and implements Mao Zedong Thought the most loyally, resolutely, and thoroughly. He is our best example. We will resolutely carry out Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, like the PLA, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher, and grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works more tightly, more practically, and raise it to a new level.

    热烈响应林彪同志号召把毛主席著作学得更好用得更好
    大庆人决心像解放军那样永远忠于毛主席
    毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的真理，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。必须彻底把毛泽东思想贯彻于全党全军全国人民，用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想。
    据新华社十五日讯　林彪同志最近向人民解放军发出的把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动提高到一个新阶段的号召传到大庆油田以后，广大职工和家属立即热烈地展开了学习和讨论。他们一致表示，林彪同志的指示，不仅对全军，而且对全党、全国人民都完全适用。大庆历来把解放军做为自己的学习榜样。林彪同志对解放军的指示，就是对大庆的指示。他们说，林彪同志的指示极为重要，极为适时，对深入学习毛主席著作提出了明确的方向，对搞好当前无产阶级文化大革命和促进社会主义建设具有伟大的意义。
    林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的真理，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。必须彻底把毛泽东思想贯彻于全党全军全国人民，用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想。”大庆人一致认为，林彪同志的话说得对极了，说得好极了，完全说到大庆人心坎上了。
    大庆“铁人”王进喜说：我来大庆快七年了。这些年，我们一直高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，我们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，坚决以毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针，在三大革命运动中，打了一个又一个大胜仗。俗话说：“三人一条心，黄土变成金。”有了毛泽东思想，全国七亿人民就有了统一的思想，力量就无穷无尽，比原子弹威力还大。我离开大庆一个多月，回来就看到油田有了许多变化。一二○二和一二○五两个钻井队，在我走的时候，钻井五万多米，现在已经突破了七万米大关。这样快的钻井速度，把帝国主义、修正主义远远甩在后边。这个胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是我们钻井工人活学活用毛主席著作的结果。
    大庆职工和家属对林彪同志在指示中提到的“军队一定要真正成为毛泽东思想的大学校”，作了反复的学习。他们表示，一定要在新形势下更好地活学活用毛主席著作，尽最大努力把毛泽东思想学到手，真正把大庆办成毛泽东思想的大学校。五好家属林淑华、杜恒爱说：我们大庆的职工和家属，正在毛主席指引的把各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的大道上奋勇前进。我们家属不仅务农，而且参加油田的工业生产，办了一些小型工厂。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们也和职工一起拿起笔杆子批判资产阶级。
    林彪同志指示说：“全军工作情况虽然很复杂，有各种不同的情况，但在这一点上，又复杂又不复杂，又有差别又没有差别，这就是都要用毛泽东思想统一起来。”大庆人用自己的亲身体验证明，林彪同志的这一指示无比正确。石油工业部五好标兵、大庆炼油建设指挥部第三施工队副指导员黄彦英说：我们大庆工种也很复杂，工作条件很不一样，有搞地面建设的，有研究地下油层的，工作千头万绪，我们抓哪一条呢？最根本的就是抓毛泽东思想教育，抓突出无产阶级政治。搞生产也和解放军打仗一样，就是靠人的觉悟，靠人的勇敢，靠政治因素，归根到底，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    石油工业部五好标兵、采油一部综合四队井长胡法莲说：林彪同志指出：“老三篇”最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。我在学习过程中，深深体会到这一点，毛主席的“老三篇”读了千遍万遍也还感到新鲜。要想树立坚定的无产阶级革命世界观，就得在“老三篇”上狠下功夫。因为每天思想上都有新的矛盾，每天生产上都有新的困难，每天工作上都有新的问题，只有用“老三篇”作武器，改造自己的思想，消除私心杂念，才能把工作做好。
    大庆职工和家属坚决表示，要反复学习、认真领会林彪同志的指示，在行动中坚决贯彻执行。他们说，林彪同志是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生。他对毛主席著作学得最好，用得最活，贯彻毛泽东思想最忠实，最坚决，最彻底，是我们最好的榜样。我们要坚决执行林彪同志的指示，像解放军那样，永远忠于毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗举得更高，把毛主席著作学习抓得更紧，更讲究落实，提高到新的水平。（附图片）
