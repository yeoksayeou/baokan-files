	You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!
	Mao Zedong

	Editor's Note: "To Make Revolution, 'Dare' Must Come First" is a moving personal account. A young worker dares to pick up the pen to criticize the reactionary "authorities" of the big and small bourgeoisie, dares to step forward and post the first revolutionary big-character poster, exposing the ghosts and snakes within the factory. He is truly a young person who cares about state affairs, a daring and skilled revolutionary fighter. Chen Afa has deep proletarian feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao and for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought will make him burn with indignation, and he will denounce them with both pen and sword. In the face of these young people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all "authorities" and "scholars" who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are nothing but paper tigers, all of them are no match. We firmly support these steadfast and combative revolutionary young fighters, praise their courageous spirit, and celebrate every victory they achieve!

	To Make Revolution, "Dare" Must Come First
	Chen Afa, Young Worker at Shanghai Qianjin Lock Factory

	I am a stamping machine operator at the Qianjin Lock Factory. In 1964, I started working there as an apprentice, just as the factory was launching a campaign to study Chairman Mao's works. I used the great Mao Zedong Thought as my weapon, working hard to transform my subjective world, standing on the stamping machine, and producing more and better locks to serve the people; at the same time, I picked up the pen to fire at the bourgeois "authorities."

	Through actual struggle, I deeply felt that with Mao Zedong Thought in our minds and with the backing of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we dare to fight and dare to criticize, fearing nothing. No matter how famous the bourgeois "authorities" are, we can all bring them down.

	Wielding the Iron Pen to Sweep Away the "Harmful Creatures"

	In 1964, the newspapers launched a criticism of Yang Xianzhen. Initially, I thought it was a matter of the "academic world" and had nothing to do with ordinary workers like us, so I didn't pay much attention. Later, I heard that Yang Xianzhen's "unification of opposites" was against Chairman Mao's dialectical view of "one divides into two," and was against Mao Zedong Thought. This aroused my anger and hatred. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the working people, it is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Yang Xianzhen opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. How could this be an academic issue? It was clearly a serious class struggle!

	With boundless love for Chairman Mao, I prepared to write an article criticizing Yang Xianzhen. However, looking at Yang Xianzhen's dark book, full of mystification, it was really hard to understand. Could I, an ordinary worker, criticize this "philosophical authority"?

	With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and learned about Chairman Mao's view of "one divides into two." I understood that in a class society, advocating "unification of opposites" is to erase class contradictions and cover up class struggle. I also thought about how the capitalists in the factory often said, "Now I eat in the same canteen as you workers, work in the same workshop, and get the same wages. What's the difference between us?" The modern revisionists of the Khrushchev group have always been advocating the "three unifications" line, promoting Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world. Isn't Yang Xianzhen's "unification of opposites" singing the same tune as them? I no longer cared about what "authority" he was; I was determined to fight him to the end.

	Using Chairman Mao's views, with class hatred, I wrote in one breath an article titled "Same and Different," exposing Yang Xianzhen's "unification of opposites" fallacy as aiding the capitalists, as a revisionist clich√©, as deceitful talk. This article was soon published in the newspaper, which greatly encouraged me. On this basis, I also engaged in a struggle against Feng Ding's theory of extinguishing class struggle.

	Through the struggle against Yang Xianzhen and Feng Ding, I realized that the so-called "authorities" of the bourgeoisie were actually paper tigers, strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought could completely bring down the "black tyrants."

	Last year in November, Comrade Yao Wenyuan published the article "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,'" firing a cannon at Wu Han, a capitalist-roader in power. What was the problem with "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"? With questions in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and used the six political criteria that Chairman Mao provided to distinguish between flowers and weeds to expose Wu Han's true form.

	"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was closely linked to the "reversal of verdicts" at that time, advocating for the right-opportunists who had been dismissed from office, attacking the Party as a big poisonous weed. Just as I was about to pick up my pen to write a critical article, a young person in the factory said to me, "Hai Rui is a clean and upright official. Even an 80-year-old grandmother says he is good." Hearing this, I was very surprised. The influence of feudal ideology was so serious! Chairman Mao told us that the future of the world ultimately belongs to us young people. If our minds are controlled by those "clean officials," ancient people, and dead people, how can we take over the class of the proletariat? Thinking of this, my determination to write the article became even greater. Therefore, in late November of last year, I wrote an article titled " 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' Is a Big Poisonous Weed" and sent it to the newspaper.

	Later, I also joined the struggle to criticize the "Three Families Village" and the black line of literature from the 1930s led by Zhou Yang. In the practice of the Cultural Revolution, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's works are the "treasure" of struggle. With it, we are full of strength, we fear nothing; with it, we have the ability to struggle, and we can sweep away all harmful creatures, having no enemies!

	Daring to Lead the Charge for the Revolution

	After June 1, the People's Daily continuously published important editorials such as "Sweep Away All Ghosts and Monsters." I repeatedly studied these editorials.

	At that time, I thought that if we only swept away a few revisionist leaders at the top, without completely uprooting the revisionist roots in society, we still could not guarantee that our country would not change color in the future. Therefore, I decided to write a big-character poster exposing the problems in the factory. But then I thought, facing the ghosts and monsters in the factory, seeing them every day, if you fight them hard, they will retaliate openly or secretly. Besides, no one in the factory had written such a big-character poster yet. Should I be the first to fire the shot?

	I studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn and have the least conservative thoughts, especially in the socialist era." Chairman Mao's words once again illuminated my path forward. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we revolutionary youth should follow the battle orders of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and have the spirit of "daring" to come first. Even if it is a mountain of knives or a sea of fire, we must go, and we must not have any private thoughts. After my thoughts were clear, that night I wrote the first revolutionary big-character poster with the team member Wang Junzhang.

	After this big-character poster was posted, the workers in the factory were greatly shocked. Revolutionary masses said, "It's right, it's well written!" They also wrote big-character posters one after another. Master Zhang Wenhai had rich experience in struggle and had a large amount of class struggle materials. I wrote a batch of big-character posters with him, each one like a heavy artillery shell, exposing a large number of facts about the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the factory.

	A few people with anti-Party and anti-socialist actions hated the revolutionary big-character posters to the core. First, they questioned Master Zhang, demanding that he reveal who the "mastermind" behind this big-character poster was. Master Zhang was not intimidated. He said firmly, "The more they attack me, the more I will write, and I will definitely expose all their cards."

	This trick did not work, so they surrounded me. I replied confidently, "I follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I will firmly oppose all anti-Party actions that do not conform to Chairman Mao's instructions!" They asked, "Where did you get your materials from?" I said, "The anti-Party crimes were committed by you, and the materials were created by you yourselves." Another person shouted loudly, "Who is backing you up?" I said, "The Communist Party is backing me up!" Another person followed up, "Who instructed you to do this?" I proudly said, "Chairman Mao instructed me to do this!" Facing their attacks, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and the support of the worker masses, and I did not waver at all.

	In this struggle, I deeply realized that the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is indeed a life-and-death class struggle. To make a revolution, you cannot be afraid of this or that. Their attacks did not intimidate me, and my fighting spirit became even more resolute.
