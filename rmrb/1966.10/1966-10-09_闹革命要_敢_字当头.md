	You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!
	Mao Zedong

	Editor's Note: "To Make Revolution, 'Dare' Must Come First" is a moving personal account. A young worker dares to pick up the pen to criticize the reactionary "authorities" of the big and small bourgeoisie, dares to step forward and post the first revolutionary big-character poster, exposing the ghosts and snakes within the factory. He is truly a young person who cares about state affairs, a daring and skilled revolutionary fighter. Chen Afa has deep proletarian feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao and for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought will make him burn with indignation, and he will denounce them with both pen and sword. In the face of these young people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all "authorities" and "scholars" who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are nothing but paper tigers, all of them are no match. We firmly support these steadfast and combative revolutionary young fighters, praise their courageous spirit, and celebrate every victory they achieve!

	To Make Revolution, "Dare" Must Come First
	Chen Afa, Young Worker at Shanghai Qianjin Lock Factory

	I am a stamping machine operator at the Qianjin Lock Factory. In 1964, I started working there as an apprentice, just as the factory was launching a campaign to study Chairman Mao's works. I used the great Mao Zedong Thought as my weapon, working hard to transform my subjective world, standing on the stamping machine, and producing more and better locks to serve the people; at the same time, I picked up the pen to fire at the bourgeois "authorities."

	Through actual struggle, I deeply felt that with Mao Zedong Thought in our minds and with the backing of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we dare to fight and dare to criticize, fearing nothing. No matter how famous the bourgeois "authorities" are, we can all bring them down.

	Wielding the Iron Pen to Sweep Away the "Harmful Creatures"

	In 1964, the newspapers launched a criticism of Yang Xianzhen. Initially, I thought it was a matter of the "academic world" and had nothing to do with ordinary workers like us, so I didn't pay much attention. Later, I heard that Yang Xianzhen's "unification of opposites" was against Chairman Mao's dialectical view of "one divides into two," and was against Mao Zedong Thought. This aroused my anger and hatred. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the working people, it is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Yang Xianzhen opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. How could this be an academic issue? It was clearly a serious class struggle!

	With boundless love for Chairman Mao, I prepared to write an article criticizing Yang Xianzhen. However, looking at Yang Xianzhen's dark book, full of mystification, it was really hard to understand. Could I, an ordinary worker, criticize this "philosophical authority"?

	With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and learned about Chairman Mao's view of "one divides into two." I understood that in a class society, advocating "unification of opposites" is to erase class contradictions and cover up class struggle. I also thought about how the capitalists in the factory often said, "Now I eat in the same canteen as you workers, work in the same workshop, and get the same wages. What's the difference between us?" The modern revisionists of the Khrushchev group have always been advocating the "three unifications" line, promoting Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world. Isn't Yang Xianzhen's "unification of opposites" singing the same tune as them? I no longer cared about what "authority" he was; I was determined to fight him to the end.

	Using Chairman Mao's views, with class hatred, I wrote in one breath an article titled "Same and Different," exposing Yang Xianzhen's "unification of opposites" fallacy as aiding the capitalists, as a revisionist cliché, as deceitful talk. This article was soon published in the newspaper, which greatly encouraged me. On this basis, I also engaged in a struggle against Feng Ding's theory of extinguishing class struggle.

	Through the struggle against Yang Xianzhen and Feng Ding, I realized that the so-called "authorities" of the bourgeoisie were actually paper tigers, strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought could completely bring down the "black tyrants."

	Last year in November, Comrade Yao Wenyuan published the article "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,'" firing a cannon at Wu Han, a capitalist-roader in power. What was the problem with "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"? With questions in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and used the six political criteria that Chairman Mao provided to distinguish between flowers and weeds to expose Wu Han's true form.

	"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was closely linked to the "reversal of verdicts" at that time, advocating for the right-opportunists who had been dismissed from office, attacking the Party as a big poisonous weed. Just as I was about to pick up my pen to write a critical article, a young person in the factory said to me, "Hai Rui is a clean and upright official. Even an 80-year-old grandmother says he is good." Hearing this, I was very surprised. The influence of feudal ideology was so serious! Chairman Mao told us that the future of the world ultimately belongs to us young people. If our minds are controlled by those "clean officials," ancient people, and dead people, how can we take over the class of the proletariat? Thinking of this, my determination to write the article became even greater. Therefore, in late November of last year, I wrote an article titled " 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' Is a Big Poisonous Weed" and sent it to the newspaper.

	Later, I also joined the struggle to criticize the "Three Families Village" and the black line of literature from the 1930s led by Zhou Yang. In the practice of the Cultural Revolution, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's works are the "treasure" of struggle. With it, we are full of strength, we fear nothing; with it, we have the ability to struggle, and we can sweep away all harmful creatures, having no enemies!

	Daring to Lead the Charge for the Revolution

	After June 1, the People's Daily continuously published important editorials such as "Sweep Away All Ghosts and Monsters." I repeatedly studied these editorials.

	At that time, I thought that if we only swept away a few revisionist leaders at the top, without completely uprooting the revisionist roots in society, we still could not guarantee that our country would not change color in the future. Therefore, I decided to write a big-character poster exposing the problems in the factory. But then I thought, facing the ghosts and monsters in the factory, seeing them every day, if you fight them hard, they will retaliate openly or secretly. Besides, no one in the factory had written such a big-character poster yet. Should I be the first to fire the shot?

	I studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn and have the least conservative thoughts, especially in the socialist era." Chairman Mao's words once again illuminated my path forward. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we revolutionary youth should follow the battle orders of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and have the spirit of "daring" to come first. Even if it is a mountain of knives or a sea of fire, we must go, and we must not have any private thoughts. After my thoughts were clear, that night I wrote the first revolutionary big-character poster with the team member Wang Junzhang.

	After this big-character poster was posted, the workers in the factory were greatly shocked. Revolutionary masses said, "It's right, it's well written!" They also wrote big-character posters one after another. Master Zhang Wenhai had rich experience in struggle and had a large amount of class struggle materials. I wrote a batch of big-character posters with him, each one like a heavy artillery shell, exposing a large number of facts about the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the factory.

	A few people with anti-Party and anti-socialist actions hated the revolutionary big-character posters to the core. First, they questioned Master Zhang, demanding that he reveal who the "mastermind" behind this big-character poster was. Master Zhang was not intimidated. He said firmly, "The more they attack me, the more I will write, and I will definitely expose all their cards."

	This trick did not work, so they surrounded me. I replied confidently, "I follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I will firmly oppose all anti-Party actions that do not conform to Chairman Mao's instructions!" They asked, "Where did you get your materials from?" I said, "The anti-Party crimes were committed by you, and the materials were created by you yourselves." Another person shouted loudly, "Who is backing you up?" I said, "The Communist Party is backing me up!" Another person followed up, "Who instructed you to do this?" I proudly said, "Chairman Mao instructed me to do this!" Facing their attacks, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and the support of the worker masses, and I did not waver at all.

	In this struggle, I deeply realized that the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is indeed a life-and-death class struggle. To make a revolution, you cannot be afraid of this or that. Their attacks did not intimidate me, and my fighting spirit became even more resolute.

### 闹革命要“敢”字当头

专栏：

    你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛泽东
    编者按：《闹革命要“敢”字当头》，是一篇动人的自述。一位普通的年青工人，敢于拿起笔杆，批判大小资产阶级的反动“权威”，敢于挺身而出，贴出第一张革命的大字报，揭露厂内的牛鬼蛇神。他真正是关心国家大事的好青年，是敢于斗争、善于斗争的小闯将。陈阿发对我们伟大的领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情。谁要是反对毛泽东思想，他就忍不住满腔怒火，口诛笔伐。在这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年人面前，一切反对毛泽东思想的“权威”、“学者”，统统都是纸老虎，统统都不在话下。我们坚决支持这些立场坚定、斗争性强的革命小将，赞扬他们的勇敢精神，欢呼他们取得的每一个胜利！
    闹革命要“敢”字当头
    上海前进锁厂青年工人　陈阿发
    我是前进锁厂的冲床工人，一九六四年进厂当艺徒，正好碰上厂里掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮。我用伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，一面努力改造主观世界，脚踏冲床，做出更多更好的锁去为人民服务；一面又拿起笔杆，向资产阶级“权威”开火。
    通过实际斗争的教育，我深深地体会到：有毛泽东思想武装头脑，有党中央和毛主席撑腰，我们就敢斗敢批，什么也不怕。不管名气多么大的资产阶级“权威”，统统都能打倒。
    举铁笔横扫“害人虫”
    一九六四年，报上开展对杨献珍的批判。起初，我认为那是“学术界”的事，和我们普通工人不搭界，也就不太关心。后来听说杨献珍的“合二而一”是反对毛主席的“一分为二”的哲学观点的，是反对毛泽东思想的，这就激起了我的愤怒与仇恨。毛泽东思想是我们劳动人民的命根子，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。杨献珍反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，这那里是什么学术问题，明明是一场严重的阶级斗争！
    我带着对毛主席无限热爱的心情，准备写文章批判杨献珍。但是，看看杨献珍的黑书，故弄玄虚，实在难懂，我这个普通工人，能批判这个“哲学权威”吗？
    带着这个问题，我学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》，学习了毛主席的一分为二的观点，懂得了在阶级社会中宣扬“合二而一”，就是抹煞阶级矛盾，掩盖阶级斗争。我又想到厂里的资本家经常说：“我现在和你们工人一样在食堂里吃饭，一样在车间里劳动，一样拿工资，同你们没啥区别了”。现代修正主义赫鲁晓夫集团也一直在宣扬“三和”路线，鼓吹苏美合作主宰世界。杨献珍的“合二而一”论，不是和他们同唱一个调子吗？我再也不管他是什么“权威”，定要与他斗个明白。
    我运用毛主席的观点，带着阶级仇恨，一鼓作气，写出了一篇题为《一样与不一样》的文章，揭露杨献珍的“合二而一”谬论是为资本家帮腔，是修正主义的滥调，是骗人的鬼话。这篇文章在报上很快就发表了，这对我鼓舞很大。在这基础上，我又与冯定的阶级斗争熄灭论开展了斗争。
    通过斗杨献珍，斗冯定，我认识到资产阶级的所谓“权威”，其实也不过是外强中干的纸老虎，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，是完全可以打倒“黑阎王”的。
    去年十一月，姚文元同志发表了《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》的文章，向吴晗这个走资本主义道路的当权派开了炮。《海瑞罢官》究竟是什么问题呢？我带着问题学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，用毛主席区分香花毒草的六条政治标准这面照妖镜一照，就照出了吴晗的原形。
    《海瑞罢官》是同当时的“翻案风”紧密呼应，为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子叫冤喊屈，向党进攻的一株大毒草。正当我要拿起笔来写批判文章的时候，厂里有一个青年对我说：“海瑞是个清官大老爷，连八十岁的老奶奶也说他好。”听了这话我非常吃惊，封建意识形态的影响多么严重呵！毛主席告诉我们，世界的未来，归根结底是属于我们青年的。如果我们青年的头脑里被那些“清官”、古人、死人统治着，怎能接好无产阶级的班呢？想到这里，我写文章的决心更大了，于是在去年十一月下旬，写了一篇《〈海瑞罢官〉是株大毒草》的文章寄给报社。
    以后，我又投入了批判“三家村”和批判以周扬为首的三十年代文艺黑线的斗争。我在文化大革命的实践中深深体会到，毛主席著作是战斗的“法宝”，有了它，我们浑身是力量，我们什么都不怕；有了它，我们就有了斗争的本领，就能扫除一切害人虫，全无敌！
    为革命敢于打头阵
    六月一日以后，《人民日报》连续发表了《横扫一切牛鬼蛇神》等重要的社论。我反复地学习了这些社论。
    当时我想，如果我们仅仅扫掉了几个在上面的修正主义头子，不彻底铲除社会上的修正主义根子，那还不能保证我们的国家今后不变颜色。于是我就打算写揭发厂里问题的大字报。但是又一想，同厂里的牛鬼蛇神，天天见面，日日碰头，你斗得他狠，他们会明里暗里进行报复。再说厂里还没有人写这样的大字报，自己去开头炮行吗？
    我又带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”毛主席的话又一次照亮了我前进的道路。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们革命青年应该听从党中央、毛主席的战斗命令，要有“敢”字当头的精神。就是刀山、火海也要上，决不能有半点私心杂念。思想通了，当晚就和团员王俊章写出了第一张革命的大字报。
    这张大字报张贴出来以后，厂内职工震动很大。革命的群众都说：“揭得对，写得好！”他们也纷纷写出了大字报。张文海师傅有丰富的斗争经验，掌握了大量的阶级斗争的活材料。我和他一道写了一批大字报，张张都像是重磅炮弹，揭发了厂内社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的大量事实。
    少数有反党反社会主义言行的人，对革命的大字报恨之入骨。先是质问张师傅，一定要他说出谁是这张大字报的“主使人”。张师傅没有被吓倒。他坚定地说：“他们越是攻我，我越是要写，一定把他们的底牌统统翻出来。”
    这一手没有得逞，他们又对我围攻。我理直气壮地回答：“我听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，我对不符合毛主席指示的一切反党言行，就要坚决反对！”他们追问：“你们的材料是从什么地方来的？”我说：“反党罪行是你们干的，材料是你们自己一手造的。”另一个家伙大声地叫嚷：“是谁撑你的腰？”我说：“是共产党撑我的腰！”还有个家伙接着问：“谁指使你这样干的？”我自豪地说：“是毛主席指示我这样干的！”面对着他们的围攻，我想起了毛主席的教导，想起了工人群众的支持，丝毫不动摇。
    在这场斗争中使我深刻地认识到，当前的无产阶级文化大革命确实是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。要革命就不能怕这怕那。这些人的围攻吓不倒我，我的斗志更加坚定了。
