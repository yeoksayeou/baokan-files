Responding to Chairman Hu's battle call, the heroic people of North Vietnam, under the great inspiration of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, have unleashed the mighty power of people's war. By October 14, they had shot down 1,500 American aggressor planes, shattering the boast of American invaders about their "air superiority."

The 1,500th enemy plane was shot down by the military and people of Nghe An Province. It was an American F-105 jet fighter known as the "Thunderchief."

According to further reports, the military and people of Thanh Hoa Province shot down three more American aggressor planes on October 16 and 17. Thus, by October 17, the military and people of North Vietnam had shot down a total of 1,503 American aggressor planes.

The General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement on October 18, celebrating the glorious achievements of the military and people of North Vietnam in shooting down 1,500 American aggressor planes. The statement pointed out that the more the U.S. imperialists escalate the war in Vietnam, the more disastrous their defeat will be. The military and people of Vietnam, in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call, will not fear hardship or sacrifice and will resolutely defeat all U.S. aggressor "escalation" actions, striving for a complete victory.

The statement said that after suffering heavy losses in their "dry season offensive" plan, the U.S. imperialists stubbornly continued to intensify their war of aggression in South Vietnam and escalate their war against North Vietnam. American aggressor planes have been relentlessly bombing Vietnamese cities, villages, bridges, roads, factories, hospitals, and schools day and night. Even more seriously, they have bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the port city of Haiphong, and have destroyed water conservancy projects during the rainy season. They have also blatantly dispatched B-52 bombers to bomb the demilitarized zone multiple times.

The statement pointed out that this does not indicate the strength of U.S. imperialism, but rather reflects their desperate actions in the face of heavy losses and a passive situation.

The statement said that the savage actions of U.S. imperialism will not intimidate the brave and unyielding people of Vietnam, but will only fuel their hatred for the American aggressors and strengthen their resolve to defeat them.

The statement warmly applauded the heroic military and people of South Vietnam for their new glorious victories after foiling the U.S. imperialists' "dry season offensive." The statement said that the firm will and determination of the Vietnamese military and people are unshakable, and they have the strength to defeat any form of war waged by U.S. imperialism in any situation.

The statement pointed out that although U.S. imperialism has suffered serious setbacks, it will not abandon its ambition to invade Vietnam. In the South, it is hastily preparing for a new, larger, and more brutal "dry season offensive" plan; in the North, it is increasingly frantically continuing air strikes, while also plotting to use ground troops to attack areas north of the 17th parallel, attempting to expand the war of aggression to the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. To cover up its new military adventures, U.S. imperialism is also playing the old trick of "peace talks."

The statement sternly warned U.S. imperialism: the more ferocious and desperate it becomes, the greater and more shameful its defeat will be, and it will surely face the deserved punishment from the Vietnamese military and people.

	Vietnamese anti-aircraft troops in the northern province of Bac Thai bravely fought and fiercely struck down the invading American air pirates.

    响应胡主席战斗号召　发挥人民战争强大威力
    越南北方军民已击落美机一千五百架
    越人民军总司令部公报说越南军民战胜美帝的决心不可动摇
    新华社河内十八日电  据这里十八日晚上公布，英雄的越南北方军民在胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召的鼓舞下，发挥人民战争的强大威力，到十四日为止，已经击落美国强盗飞机一千五百架，粉碎了美国侵略者吹嘘的“空中优势”。
    第一千五百架敌机是被义安省军民击落的。这是一架被称为“雷公式”的美国F105型喷气式战斗机。
    另据公布，清化省军民在十六日和十七日又击落美国强盗飞机三架。这样，到十七日为止，越南北方军民共击落美国强盗飞机一千五百零三架。
    新华社河内十八日电　越南人民军总司令部十八日就越南北方军民击落美国强盗飞机一千五百架的辉煌战绩发表公报指出：美帝国主义越是扩大侵越战争，就必将遭到更加惨重的失败。越南军民响应胡志明主席的神圣号召，不怕艰苦、不怕牺牲，坚决打败美国强盗的一切战争“升级”行动，争取彻底胜利。
    公报说，美帝国主义在“旱季反攻”计划遭到惨重失败以后，仍然顽固地继续加强侵略越南南方的战争和加强对越南北方进行战争“升级”。美国强盗飞机夜以继日地滥肆轰炸越南北方的城市、村庄、桥梁、公路、工厂、医院和学校。更严重的是，它轰炸了越南民主共和国首都河内市和海防市，并且在汛期轰炸破坏水利工程，以及明目张胆地派遣B—52型轰炸机多次轰炸非军事区。
    公报指出，这并不表明美帝国主义的强大，相反，这只是它在遭到惨重失败后处于被动困境的绝望行动。
    公报说，美帝国主义的野蛮行动绝对吓不倒英勇不屈的越南人民，而只能使越南人民对美国侵略者仇恨的火焰越烧越旺，使越南南北两方军民更加决心击败它。
    公报热烈欢呼英雄的越南南方军民在粉碎了美帝国主义的“旱季反攻”以后取得的新的辉煌胜利。公报说，越南军民的坚定意志和决心是不可动摇的，越南军民有足够的力量在任何情况下打败美帝国主义的任何一种战争。
    公报指出，美帝国主义遭到了严重的失败，但是它不会放弃侵略越南的野心。在南方，它正在加紧为一项新的、更大的、更残酷的“旱季反攻”计划作准备；在北方，它正在日益疯狂地继续用空军进行袭击，同时还阴谋使用步兵进攻十七度线以北的地区，妄图把侵略战争扩大到越南民主共和国领土。美帝国主义为了掩盖新的军事冒险，还正在玩弄陈旧不堪的“和平谈判”的骗人把戏。
    公报严厉警告美帝国主义：它越是凶恶和疯狂，就必定遭到更大和更为可耻的失败，就必将遭到越南军民的应有惩罚。（附图片）
