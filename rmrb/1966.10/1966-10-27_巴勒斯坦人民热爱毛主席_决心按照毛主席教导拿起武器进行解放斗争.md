The Palestinian people in the Gaza region have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and have expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously raise their consciousness, be self-reliant, take up arms, and fight for liberation.

The newspaper "Palestinian Patriot" published an article stating: "Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary teacher in the world. Under his leadership, the Chinese people liberated their own country and successfully built their own nation. This provides a brilliant example for the Palestinian people. Now, the Vietnamese people have also set an example for us in resisting American imperialism. We should learn from these examples and take up arms to liberate our homeland."

A Palestinian fighter said: "Chairman Mao and the Chinese people hold the greatest position in our hearts, and this is unchangeable and unshakable." He and his comrades-in-arms requested their Chinese friends to convey their most sincere greetings and highest respect to Chairman Mao.

During the recent visit and performance by the Chinese Folk Dance Troupe in the Gaza region, there were many moving scenes where the local people enthusiastically shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" In the theater, whenever the audience applauded enthusiastically for the successful performance of the dance troupe, they would spontaneously shout, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" Sometimes, when the car carrying the performers of the dance troupe passed through the streets, passersby, local residents, and school students would all enthusiastically shout, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" Some young table tennis players who had recently visited China held copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang "The East Is Red" in Chinese to welcome the Chinese performers. They also shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Palestinian peoples!"

A female table tennis player specially requested her Chinese friend to translate the Chinese quotations of Chairman Mao into Arabic so that she could directly understand Chairman Mao's teachings.

A Palestinian youth said that it was Chairman Mao who taught them to distinguish between enemies and friends. The Chinese people resolutely support the Palestinian people's struggle against American imperialism and its lackey Israel. The Chinese people are the true friends of the Palestinian people. He said that the Soviet revisionist clique verbally supports Palestine, but in politics, economics, and diplomacy, it colludes with Israel. On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet revisionist clique also expresses support for the Vietnamese people, but in reality, it serves the American "peace talks" conspiracy.

After studying Chairman Mao's statement that "the decisive factor in war is the people, not a few modern weapons," he pointed out that the Palestinian people should continuously raise their consciousness, be self-reliant, take up arms, and fight against American imperialism and its lackey Israel.

    巴勒斯坦人民热爱毛主席
    决心按照毛主席教导拿起武器进行解放斗争
    新华社开罗二十五日电　在加沙地区的巴勒斯坦人民无限热爱毛主席，表示要按照毛主席的教导，不断提高觉悟，自力更生，拿起武器，进行争取解放的斗争。
    《巴勒斯坦爱国者报》发表文章说：“毛主席是世界上最伟大的革命导师。中国人民在他的领导下解放了自己的国家，成功地建设着自己的国家。这为巴勒斯坦人民提供了光辉的范例。现在，越南人民又给我们提供了抗击美帝国主义的范例。我们应该效法这些榜样，拿起武器来解放我们的祖国。”
    一位巴勒斯坦战士说：“毛主席和中国人民在我们的心目中占有最大的位置，这是永远不可改变和不可动摇的。”他和他的战友们要求他们的中国朋友向毛主席转达他们最诚挚的问候和最崇高的敬意。
    在中国民间歌舞团最近在加沙地区访问演出期间，一再出现当地群众热烈欢呼“毛主席万岁”的动人场面。在剧院里，观众们每当热烈鼓掌祝贺歌舞团演出成功时，就情不自禁地高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”有时，载着歌舞团演员的车子开过街道，过往行人和当地居民，以及学校的学生都纷纷纵情高呼“毛泽东主席万岁！”一些不久前曾经访问过中国的青年乒乓球运动员，他们手里捧着《毛主席语录》本，用中文高唱《东方红》来欢迎中国的演员。他们还操着中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”“中国和巴勒斯坦人民友谊万岁！”。
    一个女乒乓球运动员还特地请她的中国朋友把中文的毛主席语录译成阿拉伯语，以便直接领会毛主席的教导。
    一位巴勒斯坦青年说，是毛主席教导他们分清了敌人和朋友。中国人民坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从以色列的斗争，中国人民就是巴勒斯坦人民的真正朋友。他说，苏联修正主义集团口头上也说支持巴勒斯坦，但是，在政治上、经济上和外交上却同以色列进行勾结。在越南问题上，苏联修正主义集团也表示支持越南人民，但是实际上却为美国“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    他在学习毛主席关于“决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器”的论断之后指出，巴勒斯坦人民应该不断提高觉悟，自力更生，拿起武器同美帝国主义及其仆从以色列进行斗争。
