Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shaoxing revolutionary masses hold rallies to solemnly commemorate the 30th anniversary of Lu Xun's death. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from Lu Xun's great revolutionary and fighting spirit, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary line, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang, and unshakably carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to the New China News Agency, Shanghai, where Lu Xun spent the last ten glorious years of his fighting life, held a grand rally today to solemnly commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of Lu Xun, whom our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao called the greatest and bravest flag bearer of China's new cultural army.

Over ten thousand workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary youth who have been charging into the front lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution participated in the meeting. The attendees, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, expressed their common resolve: to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from Lu Xun's great revolutionary and fighting spirit, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line; resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary line, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang; concentrate forces to strike down a handful of bourgeois rightists and those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on the literary front and other fronts, and unshakably carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Leaders from the Party, government, and military of Shanghai, members of the Central Committee's East China Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Committee's Cultural Revolution Group, and leaders of various people's organizations in Shanghai attended the meeting. The leader of the Albanian Cultural Delegation, Visan Kilica, and the leader of the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, Seisuke Shimizu, who are visiting Shanghai, were also invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Wang Shaoyong, deputy head of the Shanghai Municipal Committee's Cultural Revolution Group. Ding Xuelai, worker writer Hu Wanchun, and Red Guard Ji Zhongxing spoke at the meeting.

Ding Xuelai said in his speech that commemorating Lu Xun in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entering a new high tide is of extraordinary significance. Chairman Mao gave a very high evaluation of the brilliant and fighting life of the great communist warrior Lu Xun. Chairman Mao said: "Lu Xun is the most correct, bravest, most resolute, most loyal, most enthusiastic, and unprecedented national hero on the cultural front, representing the majority of the nation, charging into the enemy's ranks." What is most worth learning from Lu Xun is the thorough revolutionary communist spirit he showed in class struggle.

He said that Lu Xun not only defeated the mad attacks and persecutions of open enemies from the front, but also deeply exposed the ugly face of the "worms in our own camp" represented by Zhou Yang, ruthlessly tearing off their false revolutionary masks. In the 1930s, Zhou Yang faithfully carried out Wang Ming's opportunist line. Zhou Yang put forward the so-called "National Defense Literature" slogan, vigorously promoting class surrenderism and national surrenderism. Lu Xun, on the other hand, enthusiastically supported the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy on the anti-Japanese national united front, and put forward the proletarian slogan of "mass literature of national revolutionary war," engaging in a head-on struggle with the likes of Zhou Yang. The struggle on the literary front at that time was actually an important part of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming. For thirty years, the struggle between the two lines on the literary front has never stopped.

Ding Xuelai said that in 1965, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao sounded the bugle call, and the group of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, represented by Zhou Yang, were finally exposed by the revolutionary masses and finally revealed their true colors in broad daylight. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Hu Wanchun said in his speech that we should learn from Lu Xun according to Chairman Mao's instructions, learn from his clear revolutionary stance, his indomitable "hard-boned" spirit, and his spirit of daring to revolutionize himself. We must strive to learn contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought at the highest level, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our subjective world, so that we will fear neither heaven nor earth, dare to charge into the front lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and become vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Red Guard Ji Zhongxing said excitedly at the meeting that Lu Xun is a great revolutionary rebel. He rebelled against imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and all opportunist lines. Lu Xun waged an uncompromising struggle against the opportunist line represented by Zhou Yang, defending the Marxist-Leninist line represented by Chairman Mao. We Red Guards must learn from Lu Xun's spirit of daring to rebel and daring to revolutionize, rebel against imperialism, revisionism, those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and reactionary academic "authorities," and rebel against the "four olds," to forge a new world that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. We will resolutely implement the "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao, resolutely defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, imprint Mao Zedong Thought in our brains, dissolve it in our blood, and implement it in our actions, to be lifelong little red soldiers of Chairman Mao.

According to the New China News Agency, Guangzhou, over five thousand workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals held a grand rally today to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of the great communist warrior Lu Xun.

The meeting was held at the Guangzhou Gymnasium and was presided over by Zhu Mengjue, a responsible comrade of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Attendees included leaders from the Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Party, government, and military, as well as various people's organizations. Japanese friend Nishizono Koichi, who is in Guangzhou, was also invited to attend the meeting.

Zhu Mengjue first spoke at the meeting. She said that the great communist warrior Lu Xun is the commander of China's cultural revolution. He is not only a great literary figure but also a great thinker and revolutionary.

Zhu Mengjue said that in the 1930s, Lu Xun fought bravely on the cultural front in two aspects: on the one hand, he opposed the counter-revolutionary cultural "encirclement" by the Kuomintang; on the other hand, he opposed the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang. In the struggle between the two lines, Lu Xun always stood on the side of Chairman Mao's correct line, while fiercely struggling against the opportunist line executed by Zhou Yang and others, which opposed Mao Zedong Thought.

Zhu Mengjue emphasized that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has finally exposed Zhou Yang and his gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the Party, and exposed their evil activities of distorting history and viciously attacking Lu Xun. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Today, as we commemorate Lu Xun, we must, like Lu Xun, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to be the first, fearing nothing, being unyielding to the enemy, and being loyal to the Party and the people. We must resolutely defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Workers from the Guangzhou Paper Mill, Zheng Xiuqian, poor peasant community member Huang Pinggen from Dongsheng Brigade of Shahe People's Commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and Yang Ziyou, a political instructor from a certain air force unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, spoke at the meeting. These three active learners of Chairman Mao's works unanimously expressed that they would follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from Lu Xun's revolutionary spirit of "frowning at a thousand accusing fingers, bowing down to be an ox for the children." They said that we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution, and we must raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, turning factories, rural areas, and the military into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representative of worker, peasant, and soldier writers Wang Xingyuan said at the meeting that we, the worker, peasant, and soldier literary warriors, will forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, like Lu Xun, bravely take up literary weapons to fight against the enemy, sing the most fighting and gunpowder-scented songs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and sing the boundless love of the poor and lower-middle peasants for the Party and Chairman Mao.

Speakers at the meeting also included representatives of Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals.

According to the New China News Agency, representatives from various sectors, including workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from Lu Xun's hometown, Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, and some of Lu Xun's relatives, held a symposium today to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of the great communist warrior Lu Xun.

Participants also visited the Lu Xun Memorial Hall in Shaoxing, which exhibits Lu Xun's life and achievements.

On October 19th, revolutionary masses from Shanghai and other places flocked to Lu Xun's tomb in Hongkou Park, Shanghai, to pay their respects to the bravest great flag bearer on China's cultural front.

    上海、广州、绍兴广大革命群众举行集会
    隆重纪念鲁迅逝世三十周年
    决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习鲁迅的伟大革命精神和战斗精神，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的文艺路线，彻底粉碎以周扬为代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    据新华社上海十九日电　鲁迅一生中最后的光辉十年的战斗生活所在地——上海，今天举行盛大集会，隆重纪念被我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席称为中国文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手鲁迅逝世三十周年。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的工农兵、革命的知识分子、革命干部和红卫兵以及革命青少年一万余人参加了大会。到会者满怀革命豪情表达了他们共同的决心：要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习鲁迅的伟大革命精神和战斗精神，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线；坚决贯彻执行毛主席的文艺路线，彻底粉碎以周扬为代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线；集中力量，打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子，打击党内走资本主义道路的当权派，完成文艺战线和其他战线上的一斗二批三改的任务，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    上海市党、政、军负责人，中共中央华东局、中共上海市委文化革命小组成员和上海市各人民团体负责人出席了大会。正在上海访问的阿尔巴尼亚文化代表团团长维尔桑·基利察和日本松山芭蕾舞团团长清水正夫也应邀参加了大会。
    大会由中共上海市委文化革命小组副组长王少庸主持。市委文化革命小组成员丁学雷、工人作家胡万春、红卫兵季中兴先后在大会上讲了话。
    丁学雷在讲话中说，在无产阶级文化大革命进入新高潮的大好形势下纪念鲁迅，有着异常重要的意义。毛主席对伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅的光辉的战斗的一生，作了十分崇高的评价。毛主席说：“鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。”鲁迅最值得我们学习的地方，就是他在阶级斗争中表现出来的那种彻底革命的共产主义精神。
    他说，鲁迅不仅击溃了从正面来的公开敌人的疯狂进攻和迫害，而且深刻揭露了以周扬为代表的“自己营垒里的蛀虫”的丑恶面目，毫不容情地撕开了他们伪装革命的画皮。周扬在三十年代，忠实地执行着王明的机会主义路线。周扬提出了所谓“国防文学”的口号，大肆宣扬阶级投降主义和民族投降主义。而鲁迅则热烈拥护以毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导，坚决贯彻了毛主席提出的关于抗日民族统一战线的政策，并且提出了“民族革命战争的大众文学”这一无产阶级的口号，同周扬之流进行了针锋相对的斗争。当时我国文艺战线上的这场斗争，实际上是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同王明右倾机会主义路线斗争的一个重要组成部分。三十年来，文艺战线上两条路线的斗争一直没有间断过。
    丁学雷说，一九六五年，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的号角吹响了，周扬这一帮混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，终于被革命群众揪出来了，终于在光天化日之下显出了原形。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    胡万春在讲话中说，我们应该按照毛主席的指示来学习鲁迅，学习他爱憎分明的革命立场，坚韧不拔的“硬骨头”精神和勇于不断自我革命的精神。我们要发奋学好当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想改造自己的主观世界，这样就会天不怕、地不怕，就敢于在这场无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵，作无产阶级文化大革命的闯将。
    红卫兵季中兴在大会上激动地说，鲁迅是伟大的革命造反者，他造帝国主义的反，造封建主义的反，造官僚资本主义的反，也造一切机会主义路线的反。鲁迅同以周扬为代表的机会主义路线进行了不调和的斗争，捍卫了以毛主席为代表的马克思列宁主义路线。我们红卫兵战士就是要学习鲁迅这种敢于革命，敢于造反的精神，造帝国主义、修正主义的反，造党内走资本主义道路当权派和反动的资产阶级学术“权威”的反，造“四旧”的反，闯出一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的通红通红的新世界来。我们坚决贯彻执行毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，坚决捍卫和贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决批判资产阶级反动路线，坚决用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，把毛泽东思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，做一辈子毛主席的红小兵。
    据新华社广州十九日电　广州市五千多名工农兵、红卫兵、革命干部和革命知识分子，今天举行盛大集会，纪念伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅逝世三十周年。
    大会在广州市体育馆举行，由中共广东省委负责同志区梦觉主持。参加大会的有中共中央中南局和广东省、广州市党政军以及各人民团体的负责人。在广州的日本朋友西园寺公一，也应邀出席了大会。
    区梦觉首先在会上讲话。她说，伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅，是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家。
    区梦觉说，在三十年代，鲁迅在文化战线上，无比英勇地从事两个方面的战斗：一方面是反对国民党的反革命文化“围剿”；一方面是反对以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线。鲁迅在两条路线的斗争中，始终站在毛主席的正确路线方面，而对周扬等人执行的一条与毛泽东思想相对抗的机会主义路线，进行了尖锐激烈的斗争。
    区梦觉强调指出：毛主席亲自领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，终于把周扬等一伙混进党内的反革命修正主义分子揪出来了，把他们篡改历史、恶毒攻击鲁迅的罪恶活动揭露出来了，这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们今天纪念鲁迅，就要像鲁迅那样，发扬“敢”字当头，无所畏惧，对敌人毫不妥协，对党对人民忠心耿耿的革命精神。一定要坚决捍卫和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广州造纸厂工人郑秀逵、广州市郊沙河公社东升大队贫农社员黄平根、广州部队空军某部指导员杨子有，在大会上发言。这三个学习毛主席著作积极分子一致表示，一定要遵照毛主席的教导，学习鲁迅“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”的革命精神。他们说，我们干革命靠的是毛泽东思想，一定要把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段，把工厂、农村、部队都办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    工农兵作家代表王杏元在会上说，我们工农兵文艺战士，永远要听毛主席的话，像鲁迅那样，勇敢地拿起文艺武器，去向敌人展开搏斗，唱出工农兵最战斗的、火药味浓浓的歌，唱出贫下中农对党对毛主席的无限热爱。
    在大会上发言的还有红卫兵、革命干部和革命知识分子的代表。
    据新华社杭州十九日电　鲁迅故乡——浙江省绍兴县的工农兵、红卫兵小将、革命干部等各方面代表和鲁迅的一些亲友今天举行座谈会，纪念伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅逝世三十周年。
    参加座谈的人还参观了绍兴鲁迅纪念馆的鲁迅生平事迹陈列室。（附图片）
    十月十九日，上海和各地革命群众纷纷到上海虹口公园鲁迅墓地，瞻仰我国文化战线上最英勇的伟大旗手。这是红卫兵和革命青年，在鲁迅墓前诵读毛主席赞扬鲁迅的语录，决心学习鲁迅的革命造反精神，永远忠于毛泽东思想。新华社记者摄（传真照片）
