The Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe has brought a fresh and delightful set of acrobatic performances to the capital's audience. For many years, acrobatics, which were once deemed by bourgeois "authorities" as "pure art," have been revolutionized by the revolutionary comrades of the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dared to break free from the old frameworks of the bourgeoisie, and created many new acrobatics that reflect the fiery struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, emphasize politics, and highlight Mao Zedong Thought. This has made acrobatic art shine with new vitality.

Can acrobatics reflect the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers? Can it propagate Mao Zedong Thought and serve as a tool for the class struggle to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish the proletariat? The Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe has given a resounding affirmative answer. This performance features workers, peasants, and soldiers on stage. "Construction Site," which reflects the tense and joyful labor life of construction workers, "Celebrating the Harvest," which praises the people's communes and the great leap forward in agriculture and expresses the joy of the commune members at the harvest, "Air Force Training," which reflects the dedication of our People's Liberation Army air force soldiers in defending the motherland, training diligently, and being ready to strike at any invading enemy at any time, and "Red Saleswoman," which praises the noble spirit of commercial workers who serve the people wholeheartedly—these excellent programs not only highlight Mao Zedong Thought and praise the revolutionary spirit of the worker, peasant, and soldier masses but also retain the characteristics of acrobatics, showcasing its unique strengths and achieving artistic effects that other forms of art cannot express.

Chairman Mao said, "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line. Art for art's sake, art that stands above classes, and art that is compatible with or independent of politics—such art does not exist in fact." The successful performance of the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe has thoroughly shattered the revisionist fallacies of the bourgeois "authorities." In the past, these "authorities" claimed that acrobatics could not be changed, but in reality, they did not want to change it, did not allow it to be changed, and did not want acrobatic art to serve proletarian politics. This was a struggle with us proletarians over the acrobatics field, attempting to occupy it permanently. This time, the revolutionary comrades of the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe have reclaimed this field and planted the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high on the acrobatics field. This is a victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The performers of the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe are filled with passion when they talk about the reform of acrobatics. Comrade Zhang Genbao said, "In the past, every time we performed with workers, peasants, and soldiers, they sang about socialism and praised Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, but we performed old stuff from hundreds of years ago. We couldn't express our love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and it felt very uncomfortable. Those guys like Zhou Yang had us by the throat, not allowing us to change. If it weren't for this cultural revolution, acrobatics would never have been able to turn over a new leaf."

To make a revolution, one must inevitably face difficulties and obstacles. Any new thing grows in the midst of struggle. Although some programs still have this or that flaw, their direction is completely correct. We are fully confident that the revolutionary comrades of the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe, since they can smash the old frameworks and are determined to thoroughly revolutionize old acrobatics, will definitely create socialist new acrobatics that unite revolutionary political content with as perfect artistic form as possible.

    创造社会主义的新杂技

    武汉市杂技团给首都观众带来了崭新可喜的杂技节目。多少年来，一直为资产阶级艺术“权威”称之为“纯艺术”的杂技，被武汉市杂技团的革命同志革了命。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢字当头，破了资产阶级老爷们那套旧框框，创造出许多表现工农兵火热斗争，突出政治，突出毛泽东思想的新杂技，使杂技艺术焕发出青春的光辉。
    杂技能不能表现工农兵，能不能宣传毛泽东思想，成为灭资兴无的阶级斗争的工具？武汉市杂技团已经做出了肯定的回答。这次演出是满台工农兵形象。反映建筑工人紧张愉快的劳动生活的《建筑工地》，歌颂人民公社、歌颂农业大跃进、表现社员们丰收喜悦心情的《庆丰收》，反映我人民解放军空军战士，为了保卫祖国、加紧锻炼、随时准备打击敢于进犯的敌人的《空军锻炼》，以及歌颂商业工作者全心全意为人民服务崇高精神的《红色售货员》等优秀节目，不仅突出了毛泽东思想，歌颂了工农兵群众意气风发的革命精神，也保持了杂技的特色，发挥了杂技的特长，取得了其它艺术形式难以表达的艺术效果。
    毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”武汉市杂技团这次成功的演出，彻底粉碎了资产阶级“权威”的那套修正主义谬论。过去这些“权威”们说什么杂技不能改，实际是不想改，不准改，不愿杂技艺术为无产阶级政治服务。这是在和我们无产阶级争夺杂技这个阵地，企图永远霸占下去。这次武汉市杂技团的革命同志们把这块阵地夺了回来，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高插到杂技这块阵地上来了。这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    武汉市杂技团的演员们，每谈到杂技的革新都激情满怀。张根宝同志说：“过去每次与工农兵一起演出，人家唱的是社会主义，歌颂的是毛主席和毛泽东思想，可我们演的是几百年以前的老货色，我们对党、对毛主席的热爱表达不出来，心里别扭得很。周扬这帮家伙把我们的脖子卡得死死的，不许我们改。要不是这次文化大革命，杂技仍然翻不了身。”
    要革命就一定会遇到困难，就会碰到阻力，任何新生的事物都是在斗争中成长起来的。尽管一些节目还存在着这样或那样的缺点，但他们的方向是完全正确的。我们完全相信，武汉市杂技团的革命同志们，既然能够砸碎旧框框，决心对旧杂技进行彻底的革命，就一定能够创造出革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式相统一的社会主义新杂技来。
