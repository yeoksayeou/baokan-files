"The decision is made, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's four words shine brilliantly. In the past, they inspired revolutionary forerunners to bravely fight, overcoming all obstacles, and overthrowing the three mountains that had oppressed the Chinese people; now, these four words inspire seven hundred million people to fight against class enemies and nature, achieving one victory after another. These four words have composed countless heroic victory songs! The blood battle of the 3211 Drilling Team in the fire is one of the most resounding.

From the actions of the heroes, I understand that to turn Chairman Mao's instruction into conscious action, the key lies in the four words "fear no sacrifice." Therefore, we must internalize these four words, "fear no sacrifice," into our blood and plant them deep in our souls. To achieve this, we must fundamentally transform our worldview, discard the "I," eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, and wholeheartedly serve the public, turning the spirit of fearing no sacrifice into our conscious action.

    毛泽东思想谱成的英雄凯歌
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的这四句话，光芒万丈。过去，鼓舞着革命的前辈，前赴后继，英勇奋斗，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山；现在，这四句话，又激励着七亿人民，向阶级敌人和大自然展开斗争，取得一个又一个新的胜利。这四句话，谱出了多少支英雄的凯歌！三二一一一钻井队血战火海，就是其中最响亮的一曲。
    从英雄们的行动中，我领会到，要想把毛主席的这个指示变成自觉的行动，关键在于“不怕牺牲”这四个字。所以，要把“不怕牺牲”这四个字，溶化在血液里，扎根在灵魂的深处。要做到这点，就要根本改造世界观，丢掉“我”字，清除资产阶级思想影响，就一心为公，把不怕牺牲的精神变成自己的自觉行动。
