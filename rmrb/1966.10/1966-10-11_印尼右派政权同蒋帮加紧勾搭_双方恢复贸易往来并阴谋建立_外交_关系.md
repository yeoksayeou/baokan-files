The right-wing military regime in Indonesia, following the instructions of its American imperialist masters, is increasingly colluding with the KMT regime in Taiwan.

According to a report by Agence France-Presse, after several months of "unpublicized negotiations," the Indonesian right-wing authorities and the KMT regime recently reached an agreement in Tokyo. The KMT regime agreed to sell 14.75 million yards of Taiwanese cotton fabric to the Indonesian authorities. It is also reported that on September 19, both sides formally signed an agreement for the KMT regime to process 75,000 bales of U.S. "aid" cotton for the Indonesian authorities.

According to a report by the American news agency on October 8, due to the resumption of trade relations between the Indonesian authorities and the KMT regime, they will establish formal "diplomatic" relations within the next twelve months.
