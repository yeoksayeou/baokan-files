Representatives of the 3211 Heroic Drilling Team, in the days leading up to National Day and immediately following it, reported to over 300,000 Red Guards and revolutionary students from across the country in the capital. They shared their heroic deeds of fighting through flames to save the gas well. The heroes' report, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply stirred the hearts of the young revolutionaries, inspiring them to resolve to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They aim to forge themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who are unafraid of hardship, unafraid of death, and wholeheartedly dedicated to revolution and the people.

Many middle and high school Red Guards and revolutionary students held discussions, created blackboard newspapers, wrote big-character posters, and continuously broadcast the heroes' recorded reports, sparking a wave of learning from the 3211 proletarian revolutionary heroic drilling team. "In the midst of the raging flames, why were the workers of the 3211 drilling team able to remain calm and composed? Why were they able to rush into the fire to save the gas well?" Many middle and high school Red Guards and revolutionary students discussed and unanimously agreed: It was the great Mao Zedong Thought that gave them boundless courage and strength. It was their practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, imprinting the great Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, infusing it into their blood, and putting it into action. Students from Jiangxi Communist Labor University and many Red Guards and revolutionary students from Qingdao said in their discussions: "Learning from the heroes, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works at all times, in all places, and in all things, especially to work hard on putting them into practice and using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our souls." Red Guards and revolutionary students from Beijing Normal University and Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute took the words written by the drilling team heroes in their diaries, "Imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, infuse them into our blood, and put them into action," as their motto. They use it to urge themselves to study Chairman Mao's works diligently and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

At Peking University, nearly 20,000 Red Guards and revolutionary students from Peking University and other places braved the rain to listen to the heroes' report. Many took to the stage to express their resolutions. They said: "To protect state property, the heroes truly dared to face knife mountains and fire seas. Although we do not have knife mountains and fire seas before us, we do have the great waves of class struggle. We must, like the heroes fighting through the flames, use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, charge into the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and thoroughly overthrow all monsters and demons."

     三十多万红卫兵和革命师生听了英雄钻井队的报告
    决心向英雄学习在革命烈火中锻炼成长
    据新华社五日讯　三二一一一英雄钻井队的代表们，在国庆节前后，向首都和来自全国各地的三十多万红卫兵和革命师生介绍了他们血战火海、保住气井的英雄事迹。英雄们闪耀毛泽东思想光辉的报告，强烈地激动着小将们的心，鼓舞着小将们决心在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中，活学活用毛主席著作，把自己锻炼成为一不怕苦、二不怕死，一心一意为革命，全心全意为人民的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    许多大中学校的红卫兵和革命师生纷纷座谈讨论，出黑板报、写大字报，连续播送英雄们的录音报告，掀起了学习三二一一一无产阶级革命英雄主义钻井队的热潮。“在烈焰飞腾的火海中，三二一一一钻井队的工人们为什么能够面不改色心不跳？为什么能够敢于冲入火海、抢救气井？”许多大中学校的红卫兵和革命师生在座谈中一致认为：是伟大的毛泽东思想给他们带来了无比的勇气和力量，是他们活学活用毛主席著作，把伟大的毛泽东思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上的结果。江西共产主义劳动大学和来自青岛的许多红卫兵、革命师生在座谈中说：“我们向英雄学习，最根本的一条，就是时时、处处、事事活学活用毛主席著作，特别在用字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂。”北京师范大学和北京邮电学院的红卫兵和革命师生，把钻井队英雄在他们的日记本上写下的“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上”这段话作为座右铭，用它来督促自己努力学习毛主席著作，照毛主席指示办事。
    在北京大学，近两万名北大和来自外地的红卫兵、革命师生冒雨倾听了英雄们的报告，很多人上台表示决心。他们说：“为了保护国家财产，英雄们真正做到了刀山敢上，火海敢下。我们面前虽然没有刀山火海，但是有阶级斗争的大风大浪，我们要像英雄们血战火海那样，以毛泽东思想为武器，在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵，彻底斗倒一切牛鬼蛇神。”
