    社会主义建设的明珠　中阿战斗友谊的结晶
    阿尔巴尼亚第一座钢铁企业投入生产
    据新华社地拉那十七日电　在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立二十五周年前夕，阿尔巴尼亚第一座钢铁企业——爱尔巴桑轧钢厂隆重举行正式开工典礼。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局候补委员、工业和矿产部长科乔·蒂奥多西等参加了庆祝典礼，并讲了话。蒂奥多西首先代表劳动党中央、部长会议和霍查同志热烈祝贺爱尔巴桑区人民在完成第三个五年计划中取得的成就和这个工厂的正式投入生产。
    他说，今天投入生产的这个工厂对我国经济和工业发展具有重大的意义。由于这个工厂的建成，我国重工业又增加了一个新的部门——黑色冶金工业。我们已在建立一套完整的黑色冶金工业方面跨出了坚定的一步。
    蒂奥多西说，爱尔巴桑轧钢厂是中华人民共和国在我国第三个五年计划期间给予我们的兄弟般的、国际主义援助的建设项目之一。对于这种国际主义的援助，我们向由杰出的马克思列宁主义者、我国人民尊敬的朋友毛泽东同志领导下的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，表示衷心的感谢。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办王锦川也在会上讲话，向到会者表示热烈祝贺。他高度赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义的封锁和破坏，在第三个五年计划中取得的成就。
    王锦川热情地称颂由毛泽东同志和霍查同志亲手缔造的中阿友谊。他说，爱尔巴桑轧钢厂的建成，是中阿两国友谊和团结的又一个具体例证。他说，由毛泽东思想哺育成长的中国专家，以能为兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民尽到自己应尽的无产阶级国际主义义务而感到无尚的光荣。他对这个厂的领导同志和全体职工对中国专家的关怀表示感谢。
    爱尔巴桑轧钢厂是在一九六四年四月开始兴建的设备现代化的钢铁企业。今年三月开始试生产，产品质量优良。职工们在中国专家的帮助下，只用了半年时间，基本上掌握了全部生产工艺过程。
