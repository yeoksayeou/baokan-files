By more than 2,000 Red Guards from the capital, along with the naval cultural troupe of the Guangzhou Military Region and the workers-peasants-soldiers amateur performance team from the 1966 "Summer in Harbin" music festival, a grand gala was held tonight at the Workers' Stadium in the capital to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The gala was attended by workers and peasants representatives from all over the country, representatives of ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese returning to visit their homeland, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, as well as anti-imperialist revolutionary fighters and other international friends from the five continents.

Tonight, the magnificent Workers' Stadium in Beijing was filled with a festive atmosphere. The Red Guards and workers-peasants-soldiers performers, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art, sang revolutionary songs and danced revolutionary dances, praising our great leader Chairman Mao and singing the praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. These performances fully demonstrated the spiritual face of the revolutionary people of our country who are successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Leaders from various sectors, including Tao Zhu, Kang Sheng, Zhu De, Chen Yi, Liu Ningyi, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, Yang Mingxuan, Saifudin, Gao Zongmin, Cai Tingkai, Li Siguang, Fu Zuoyi, Xie Jueying, Shen Yanbing, Li Dequan, Yang Xiufeng, and Zhang Dingcheng, attended the gala and watched the performances.

The gala began with the resounding song "The East Is Red." More than 2,000 male and female Red Guards, each holding a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," recited in unison: "The core of leadership for our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The theoretical foundation guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." "The oppressed peoples' struggle for complete liberation depends first and foremost on their own efforts, and only then on international aid. The peoples who have already won revolutionary victories should aid the struggles of those still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty."

"Thousands of songs, millions of songs, we cannot sing enough of our boundless love, faith, and admiration for you! We sincerely wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long life!" Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the Red Guards, full of passion, sang "The East Is Red" and followed it with "Great Leader Mao Zedong" and "Long Live Chairman Mao," expressing their determination to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to revolutionize to the end. The Red Guards also sang "The Song of Revolutionary Rebellion," "I Am a Soldier," and the Vietnamese combat song "Liberate the South" with high spirits.

Next, a Red Guard recited: "Workers of the world, unite! Workers of the world, unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought! Declare war on American imperialism! Declare war on modern revisionism! Declare war on all reactionaries! Resolve to fight to the end, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory!" More than 2,000 people then sang the international revolutionary anthem "The Internationale." At this moment, more than 10,000 spectators stood up in respect. After the singing ended, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause.

Amidst the thunderous applause, the members of the naval cultural troupe of the Guangzhou Military Region marched into the hall, singing "We Are the Cultural Light Cavalry of the Sea." They sang songs such as "Chairman Mao Is with Us," "Let Us Sing Mao Zedong," and "Soldiers Love to Read the Three Articles," expressing the boundless love of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for Chairman Mao. In the suite "Mao Zedong Thought Shines the World," they sang, "Mao Zedong Thought shines the world, the five continents tremble with thunder. The oppressed and exploited peoples fight shoulder to shoulder, and will not rest until they defeat the American aggressors." The warriors of Mao's literature and art sang the voice of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, stirring up wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The cultural warriors from Guangzhou also performed an attractive song and dance, "In Praise of the Red Guards," enthusiastically praising the Red Guards as a new phenomenon on the eastern horizon, as the vanguard in defending Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Drums were beaten, gongs were struck, and workers-peasants-soldiers loved to sing revolutionary songs. The performance by amateur performers from Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of our country, was also warmly received. The performers of "Beat the Drums, Sweep Away All Ghosts and Monsters" were machine workers from Heilongjiang Province, and the performers of "The Miners' Song" were coal miners from Heilongjiang. The Korean and Hezhe ethnic community members from Heilongjiang Province also performed the dances "Red Flags Flying Over the Water Conservancy Site" and "Hezhe Militia Ready," which are rich in national characteristics. The coal miners sang in their self-composed song, "The red sun shines over the mine, Mao Zedong Thought arms the coal miners, the history of art monopolized by a few people has passed, and the victory song comes from the depths of the earth!"

As the performance ended, the entire audience stood up and sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." People held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and cheered for a long time, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

Among the foreign guests invited to attend the gala were Edward Francis Hill, chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), and his wife; Sheikh Mukhtar Muhammad Hussein, head of the Somali National Assembly Friendship Delegation and speaker of the National Assembly; Abdul Munaim Khan, head of the Pakistani Friendship Delegation; Kitundu, head of the Tanzanian Friendship Delegation; N.
