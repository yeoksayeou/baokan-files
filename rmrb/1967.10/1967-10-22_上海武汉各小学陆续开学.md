Shanghai and Wuhan Primary Schools Resume Classes

Many schools are carrying out the policy of "resuming classes while making revolution," further consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, conducting revolutionary criticism, and carrying out reform within their units.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 21st: Starting from the 20th, primary schools in Shanghai have gradually resumed classes. On the 20th, most primary schools had their first class. Some schools will also gradually resume classes in the next few days.

This semester, Shanghai's primary schools have more than ten thousand new students enrolled.

Before the resumption of classes, many primary schools in Shanghai had their revolutionary mass organizations' leaders, revolutionary cadres, and some revolutionary teachers participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They seriously studied the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China regions. After the end of the last semester in late August, the revolutionary cadres and teachers of various primary schools also conducted about a month of intensive study and criticism. Through criticizing the revisionist educational thoughts and systems promoted by China's Khrushchev, such as "intellectual education first," "grades first," and "entrance exam first," they further deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and educational thoughts.

This resumption of classes, many primary schools implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, taking "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, striving to highlight Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics. They are determined to carry out both teaching and reform in this semester's teaching practice. Many primary schools, upon resuming classes, have strengthened political and ideological education. Guangling Road Primary School, upon resuming classes, conducted military and political training for senior students, organized students to study the "Three Articles," "Against Liberalism," "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and Chairman Mao's five conditions for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, learning from the People's Liberation Army, and promoting the "Three-Eight Style."

After studying Chairman Mao's educational policies and the "May 7th Directive," Shanghai's primary schools have determined the course settings and teaching content, with 18 to 24 classes per week. Generally, the courses include: Chairman Mao's Quotations, Language, Arithmetic, General Knowledge, Revolutionary Songs, Drawing, Military Sports, and Industrial and Agricultural Labor. The arithmetic textbooks for grades one to five and the language textbooks for lower grades are all newly compiled during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with content highlighting the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. For example, some arithmetic problems in the lower-grade textbooks are about calculating the exploitation accounts of landlords and capitalists against workers and poor peasants, allowing students to learn arithmetic while receiving profound class education. This semester, various primary schools will prepare to compile supplementary teaching materials for language, arithmetic, and general knowledge courses. Some schools have determined four principles for compiling supplementary teaching materials: first, propagate Mao Zedong Thought; second, closely combine with the current situation; third, target students' active thoughts; fourth, consider the age characteristics of students in different grades. Many primary schools also plan to reform teaching methods, inviting workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the People's Liberation Army to give lectures and guidance, fully mobilizing students' initiative and enthusiasm in learning.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 21st: Primary schools in the Wuhan area have gradually resumed classes since mid-October, carrying out the policy of "resuming classes while making revolution." Schools in Hongshan and Qingshan districts that resumed classes earlier are further consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination through resuming classes while making revolution, carrying out criticism, struggle, and reform within their units, and both revolutionary and teaching work are presenting a new situation.

The proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan's primary schools, through the previous stage of revolutionary criticism, promoted revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, forming a cultural revolution army with leftists as the core in the primary school sector, which laid a solid foundation for resuming classes while making revolution. Since October, various districts and schools have held resumption of classes while making revolution oath-taking rallies, symposiums, or discussion meetings. Revolutionary teachers at these meetings expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve new victories for the people in resuming classes while making revolution. Many schools have achieved great unity in resuming classes while making revolution, and some have even established revolutionary committees; schools that have not yet achieved unity have established a unified leadership body for resuming classes while making revolution through consultation. After the establishment of the united leadership group for resuming classes while making revolution in Jianghan District, the work of resuming classes while making revolution has been greatly promoted, guiding all schools in the district to achieve universal and timely resumption of classes. Since the resumption of classes, various schools have made new arrangements for teaching subjects, teaching content, and teaching methods. The main teaching content is to study the "Three Articles" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," while combining the teaching of important political events in the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan and across the country; arithmetic is also taught. To guide students to participate in the Cultural Revolution, various schools use methods such as visiting, reporting, discussing, and holding criticism meetings, educating students through practical activities. Teachers teach half a day and participate in the movement for half a day, closely combining teaching with revolution. Various schools' proletarian revolutionary factions correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, releasing a large number of cadres. Many primary schools have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing cadres to participate in learning. Some primary schools also do a good job of ideological work for cadres who have made mistakes, helping them to make amends in resuming classes while making revolution.

    用毛泽东思想培育祖国一代新人
    上海武汉各小学陆续开学
    许多学校通过复课闹革命，正在进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的三结合，进行革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改
    据新华社上海二十一日电　上海市各小学从二十日起陆续开学。二十日，大部分小学已上了第一课。一部分小学也将在最近几天内陆续上课。
    这学期上海各小学共有十多万新生入学。
    在开学之前，上海的许多小学的革命群众组织的负责人、革命干部和部分革命教师，参加了毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习了“老三篇”和毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列最新指示。上学期在八月底放假以后，各小学的革命干部、革命教师也普遍进行了一个月左右的大学习、大批判。他们通过对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“智育第一”、“分数第一”、“升学第一”等修正主义教育思想、教育制度的批判，更加提高了对毛主席的革命路线和教育思想的认识。
    这次开学，许多小学贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，努力突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治。他们决心在这学期的教学实践中，一边进行教学，一边进行改革。许多小学一开学就大力加强了政治思想教育。广灵路小学在开学时，就对高年级学生进行军政训练，组织学生学习“老三篇”、《反对自由主义》“三大纪律、八项注意”和毛主席提出的培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人的五项条件，大学解放军，大树“三八作风”。
    上海各小学学习毛主席的教育方针和“五·七”指示后，确定了课程设置和教学内容，每周上课十八节到二十四节。一般的课程有：毛主席语录、语文、算术、常识、革命歌曲、图画、军事体育和工农业劳动等。一年级到五年级的算术课本和低年级的语文课本，都是在无产阶级文化大革命中新编出来的，内容突出阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动。如低年级算术课本，有些例题就是通过算地主、资本家对工人、贫下中农的剥削帐，让学生既学了算术，又受到了深刻的阶级教育。各小学在这学期中，对语文、算术、常识等课，都准备自己编写补充教材。有的学校编写补充教材，确定了四个原则：一、宣传毛泽东思想。二、紧密结合当前形势。三、针对学生的活思想。四、照顾各年级学生年龄的特点。许多小学在教学方法上，也打算进行改革，准备邀请工人、贫下中农、解放军讲课和进行辅导，充分调动学生在学习中的主动性和积极性。
    新华社武汉二十一日电　武汉地区的小学从十月中旬以来陆续开学，复课闹革命。开学较早的洪山、青山区各小学，通过复课闹革命正在进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，进行本单位的斗批改，革命和教学工作都呈现出一派新气象。
    武汉地区小学的无产阶级革命派，经过前一阶段的革命大批判，促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，在小学界形成了一支以左派为核心的文化革命大军，这就为复课闹革命打下了坚实的基础。十月份以来，各区、校都召开了复课闹革命誓师大会、座谈会或讨论会。革命教师在这些会上表示，一定要紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，在复课闹革命中为人民立新功。许多学校在复课闹革命中实现了大联合，有的还成立了革命委员会；暂时未能联合的学校，经过协商，也建立了统一的复课闹革命的领导班子。江汉区成立了联合的复课闹革命领导小组以后，大大推动了复课闹革命工作的进展，指导全区学校做到了普遍按时复课。各校复课以来，都对教学科目、教学内容和教育方法进行了新的安排。教学内容主要是学“老三篇”和《毛主席语录》，同时结合讲授武汉和全国的文化大革命运动中的重要政治事件；另外还学算术。为了引导学生参加文化大革命，各校都采用参观、访问、听报告、讨论和开批判会等方式，使学生在实际活动中受到教育。教师则是半天上课半天参加运动，使复课和革命紧密结合。各校的无产阶级革命派正确地执行毛主席的干部政策，已经解放一大批干部。许多小学筹办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织干部参加学习。有些小学还认真做好犯错误干部的思想工作，帮助他们在复课闹革命中将功补过。
