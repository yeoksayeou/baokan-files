Chairman Mao teaches us: “Without investigation, no right to speak,” “To understand the situation, the only method is to investigate the living conditions of various classes in society.” Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to investigation and research. In every historical period of the Chinese revolution, he personally conducted a large number of investigations and research, writing brilliant works that guide the Chinese revolution and world revolution, and at the same time, scientifically summarizing the Marxist-Leninist method of investigation and research, which is mainly to hold investigation meetings. Chairman Mao particularly emphasizes: “For those who undertake guiding work, it is necessary to plan to grasp a few cities and a few villages, using the basic viewpoints of Marxism, that is, the method of class analysis, to conduct several thorough investigations. This is the most basic method to understand the situation.” To hold such investigation meetings, “without a heart full of enthusiasm, without the determination to look down, without the desire for knowledge, without the spirit of putting down one’s airs and being willing to be a small student, it is definitely impossible to do and definitely cannot be done well.” Chairman Mao’s wise teachings are the highest directives for us to conduct investigation and research.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev jumped out in 1964, shouting: “The method of holding investigation meetings is no longer applicable in many cases now.... Investigation meetings cannot investigate problems,” advocating “squatting,” “without squatting, one cannot lead,” and so on, how fierce!

At first glance, this Chinese Khrushchev, who never seriously conducts investigation and research, suddenly pays attention to “investigation and research,” isn’t it strange! But false is false, and the disguise should be stripped off. We only need to peel off the skin of the “Peach Garden Squatting” black experience concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his wife, the bourgeois element Wang XX, to see that the Chinese Khrushchev’s “squatting” harbors an unmentionable evil intention.

Chairman Mao’s method of investigation and research through investigation meetings starts from the basic point of believing in the masses and relying on the masses. He admonishes us: “The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable. Not understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge.” In the draft of the “Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Current Problems in Rural Work” personally presided over by Chairman Mao, it is also pointed out: “This movement needs strong leadership, to rely on the organization of poor and lower-middle peasants, to do a good job of investigation and research among the masses, and to mobilize the masses.” What is the Chinese Khrushchev’s “squatting”? His basic starting point is not to believe in the masses and to regard the masses as enemies. He has repeatedly shouted that now “the poor and lower-middle peasants have many concerns and do not tell us the truth, do not tell us the real situation,” and must “conduct some secret work, only by rooting and connecting, they will not be afraid and can speak.” Thus, his wife, the bourgeois element Wang XX, received his “imperial edict,” and as soon as she entered the Peach Garden, she disguised herself, changed her name, secretly investigated, and sneaked around, secretly rooting and connecting. Look, this is the Chinese Khrushchev’s investigation and research! This is a great slander against the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought!

Chairman Mao’s method of investigation and research through investigation meetings is to use the Marxist class analysis method to conduct systematic and thorough investigations and research on the surrounding environment. Class analysis is the core and soul of Chairman Mao’s investigation and research methods. However, the Chinese Khrushchev’s “Peach Garden Squatting” fiercely opposes the class analysis method that Chairman Mao has always insisted on. He, through his wife Wang XX, deliberately confused right and wrong, mixed black and white, supported the right and opposed the left in the “Peach Garden Squatting,” demoted good cadres and promoted bad cadres; and colluded with a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, ghosts, and snakes to carry out “rooting and connecting.” His “Peach Garden Squatting” is essentially a trial point for restoring capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev fiercely opposes Chairman Mao’s methods of investigation and research, opposes the mass line and class analysis in investigation and research, which is not accidental and not just a matter of methods, but serves his ultra-left in form but right in essence bourgeois reactionary line, creates public opinion, and opens the way for restoring capitalism in China.

However, “The opportunists who want to stop the tide are almost everywhere, but the tide is unstoppable. Socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, throwing all stumbling blocks behind it.” Our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the “Some Current Problems in the Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside” or the “Twenty-Three Articles,” thoroughly smashing the Chinese Khrushchev’s evil plot to use the “Four Clean-ups” movement to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. We must remember Chairman Mao’s teaching that “the enemy will not be eliminated by itself,” and thoroughly criticize the various reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, making him never be able to turn over!

　　“蹲点”是假反党是真
　　装甲兵机关无产阶级革命派
    毛主席教导我们：“没有调查就没有发言权”，“要了解情况，唯一的方法是向社会作调查，调查社会各阶级的生动情况。”毛主席一贯十分重视调查研究，在中国革命的每一个历史时期，都亲自进行了大量的调查研究，写出了指导中国革命和世界革命的光辉巨著，同时，也科学地总结了以开调查会为主的马克思列宁主义的调查研究方法。毛主席特别强调指出：“对于担负指导工作的人来说，有计划地抓住几个城市、几个乡村，用马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法，作几次周密的调查，乃是了解情况的最基本的方法。”开这样的调查会，“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”毛主席的英明教导，是我们进行调查研究的最高指示。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却在一九六四年跳了出来，大嚷大叫：“现在开调查会的办法，在很多情况下是不行了。……调查会调查不出问题来”，要“蹲点”，“不蹲点，就不能作领导了”，如此等等，好不厉害！
    乍一看去，这个从不认真作调查研究的中国赫鲁晓夫，突然重视起“调查研究”来了，岂不怪哉！但是，假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。我们只要揭开中国赫鲁晓夫及其老婆、资产阶级分子王××所炮制的“桃园蹲点”黑经验的画皮，就可以看出，中国赫鲁晓夫的“蹲点”，包藏着不可告人的祸心。
    毛主席开调查会的调查研究方法，基本出发点就是相信人民群众，依靠人民群众。他告诫我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”在毛主席亲自主持制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》中，也指出：“这次运动要有坚强的领导，要依靠贫下中农组织，要在群众中做好调查研究，要放手发动群众。”中国赫鲁晓夫的“蹲点”，是什么货色呢？他的基本出发点是不相信群众，视群众为敌人。他曾不止一次地叫嚷，现在“贫下中农有很多顾虑，不向我们说真话，不把真实情况告诉我们”，必须“进行一些秘密工作，只有扎根串连，他们不怕了，才能讲话。”于是，他的老婆、资产阶级分子王××领了他的“圣旨”，一进桃园，就象进了敌占区一样，乔装打扮，改名换姓，私查暗访，鬼鬼祟祟，大搞神秘化的扎根串连。请看，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的调查研究！这是对我们毛泽东思想哺育下的广大贫下中农群众的极大污蔑！
    毛主席开调查会的调查研究方法，就是用马克思主义的阶级分析方法，对周围环境作系统的周密的调查和研究。阶级分析，是毛主席调查研究方法的核心和灵魂。但是中国赫鲁晓夫的“桃园蹲点”，却疯狂反对毛主席历来坚持的阶级分析方法。他通过他的老婆王××，在桃园“蹲点”中，故意颠倒是非，混淆黑白，扶右反左，把好干部打下去，把坏干部扶起来；和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神搞“扎根串连”。他的“桃园蹲点”，实质上就是复辟资本主义的试点。
    中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对毛主席的调查研究方法，反对调查研究中坚持群众路线和阶级分析，绝不是偶然的，也绝不仅仅是方法问题，而是为他推行形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线服务，为在中国复辟资本主义制造舆论，开辟道路。
      但是，“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》即“二十三条”，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫妄想利用“四清”运动搞反革命复辟的罪恶阴谋。我们要牢记毛主席“敌人是不会自行消灭的”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的种种反动谬论，叫他永世不得翻身！
