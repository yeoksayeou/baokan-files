The Japanese "People's Star" celebrates the growth of the leftist forces in the Japanese Communist Party in the anti-revisionist struggle
Raising the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought to strongly oppose the Ryohei Yamamoto faction
Calling on revolutionary leftists to unite and build a genuine proletarian revolutionary party

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 13th, the organ of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Leftist) of the Japanese Communist Party, "People's Star," recently published an article pointing out that, inspired by the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary leftist forces in Japan are growing stronger and the struggle to smash the Ryohei Yamamoto revisionist faction has spread throughout the country. The article denounces the anti-China fallacies and crimes against Mao Zedong Thought committed by the Yamamoto faction, calling on members of the Japanese Communist Party to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, unite around the leftists, and strongly oppose the counter-revolutionary revisionist faction of Yamamoto.

The article says: The revolutionary leftists in Japan, inspired by the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, are fighting under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. In the past year, this struggle has developed with an irresistible momentum. The revolutionary leftist forces, with Mao Zedong Thought as their great banner, are growing stronger, while the Yamamoto revisionist faction is falling apart.

The article says: The Yamamoto revisionist faction is extremely afraid of the broad masses seeing revolutionary party members rising up everywhere, raising the banner of the left, and overthrowing their rule. Recently, they have begun publishing a large number of articles in the "Akahata" newspaper to slander these leftist party organizations. Their despicable slanders will not be able to stop the development of the leftist party organizations. The article strongly condemns the Yamamoto revisionist faction for echoing the Soviet revisionist leadership in their frenzied anti-China propaganda, and refutes the Yamamoto faction's vicious attacks on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong in tune with the Soviet revisionists.

The article points out: The Communist Party of China is a party built and nurtured by Comrade Mao Zedong, a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a great and glorious proletarian revolutionary party that has withstood the most intense, arduous, prolonged, and complex struggles in history.

When discussing the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Communist Party of China, the article warmly praises the great leader Chairman Mao for his consistent, brilliant, creative, and comprehensive inheritance, defense, and development of Marxism-Leninism; it warmly praises the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

The article says: The history and revolutionary traditions of the Communist Party of China are the traditions and history of the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to make the Communist Party of China, which has a great revolutionary tradition, degenerate into a revisionist party, to restore capitalism in China, and has consistently opposed Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Mao Zedong, attempting to seize the leadership of the party. This despicable plot has been thoroughly smashed by the Cultural Revolution. The Yamamoto revisionist faction fabricates history in an attempt to separate the Communist Party of China from the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought, which is in vain. This is what is meant by "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet," which describes fools like Yamamoto Ryohei.

The article refutes the slanders against Chairman Mao's philosophical thoughts published in the "Akahata" by the Yamamoto faction. The article points out: Comrade Mao Zedong's great philosophical work "On Contradiction" defends Lenin's philosophical views of dialectical materialism and develops them to a higher new stage, making an immense and incomparable contribution to Marxism-Leninism. Only those revisionist elements who lack revolutionary theory, historical knowledge, and understanding of practical movements, and are philosophical idiots like Yamamoto, would shamelessly publish such anti-Mao Zedong Thought articles in the "Akahata."

The article says: The Yamamoto faction is in a state of panic over the great leap forward of the leftist party organizations that raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, spreading fragmented and bizarre theories. Although they say that the leftist party organizations are "a small group of people with no basis among the Japanese people," they also say that the struggle against this "small group of people" "will affect the overall situation of our country's mass struggles, united front, and party building, and will relate to the future of the Japanese revolutionary movement, and is the most important struggle." This self-contradictory and chaotic statement shows that the Yamamoto faction is terrified of the great development of the leftist organizations.

The article says: The Yamamoto revisionist faction is so afraid of the development of the leftist forces that it is becoming more and more isolated among the revolutionary masses and is increasingly facing rebellion. We must work even harder to build a genuine proletarian revolutionary party, raise the banner of the leftist party organizations across the country, and engage in anti-revisionist struggles on a larger scale, pressing the attack and dealing a more severe blow to the Yamamoto faction. The article points out: Party members loyal to the revolution across the country will definitely stand up according to their revolutionary will and unite under the banner of the left. The counter-revolutionary slave chains of the Yamamoto faction are being broken one by one. No one can stop this revolutionary rebellion.

　　日本《人民之星》欢呼日共左派队伍在反修斗争中发展壮大
　　高举毛泽东思想红旗大造宫本集团的反
　　号召革命左派团结起来建设真正无产阶级革命政党
    据新华社十三日讯　日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）机关报《人民之星》最近刊载一篇文章指出，在中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利的鼓舞下，日本革命左派队伍日益发展壮大，粉碎宫本修正主义集团的斗争已遍及全国。文章痛斥了宫本集团的反华谬论和反毛泽东思想罪行，号召日共党员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结在左派周围，大造宫本反革命修正主义集团的反。
    文章说：日本的革命左派为中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利所鼓舞，高举当代马克思列宁主义顶峰毛泽东思想的旗帜而进行的斗争，在这一年来以排山倒海之势发展着。以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命左派队伍日益发展壮大，而宫本修正主义集团日益分崩离析。
    文章说：宫本修正主义集团非常害怕广大人民看到各地革命党员接踵而起，举起左派的旗帜，推翻他们的统治的形势。最近，他们在《赤旗报》上开始发表大量文章，对这些左派党组织进行造谣诬蔑。他们卑鄙的造谣诬蔑是决不能阻止左派党组织的发展的。文章强烈谴责宫本修正主义集团同苏修领导集团互相呼应，变本加厉地进行疯狂的反华宣传，并且驳斥了宫本集团按照苏修的调子，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和伟大领袖毛泽东主席的恶毒攻击。
    文章指出：中国共产党是毛泽东同志缔造和培育起来的党，是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党，是经受历史上最激烈、最艰苦、最长期、最复杂的斗争考验的、伟大而光荣的无产阶级革命政党。
    文章谈到中国共产党的光荣革命传统时，热烈赞扬伟大的领袖毛主席始终一贯地天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义；热烈赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。
    文章说：中国共产党的历史和革命传统，也就是当代马克思列宁主义顶峰毛泽东思想胜利的传统和历史。中国的赫鲁晓夫企图使具有伟大革命传统的中国共产党蜕化变质成为修正主义的党，企图在中国实现资本主义复辟，一贯反对毛泽东思想和毛泽东同志，篡夺党的领导权。这种卑鄙的阴谋被无产阶级文化大革命彻底粉碎了。宫本修正主义集团捏造历史企图把中国共产党同伟大的领袖毛泽东同志和毛泽东思想割裂开来，那是徒劳的。搬起石头打自己的脚，这就是说的宫本显治那样的蠢人。
    文章驳斥了宫本集团在《赤旗报》上对毛主席的哲学思想的诬蔑。文章指出：毛泽东同志伟大的哲学著作《矛盾论》，捍卫了列宁的辩证唯物论的哲学观点，并将其发展到更高的新阶段，对马克思列宁主义作出了伟大的、不可估量的贡献。只有那些既没有革命理论，又没有历史知识，更不理解实际运动的修正主义分子、哲学的白痴——宫本之流才会不知羞耻地在《赤旗报》上发表这种反对毛泽东思想的奇文。
    文章说：宫本集团对于高举毛泽东思想红旗的左派党组织的大跃进，显得手忙脚乱，散布支离破碎的奇谈怪论。他们虽然说左派党组织是“在日本人民中没有任何基础的一小撮人”，但是却又说什么同这“一小撮人”进行斗争“将会影响我国的群众斗争、统一战线、党的建设的全局，将关系到日本革命运动的前途，是最重要的斗争”。这种自相矛盾的混乱的说法就说明了宫本集团对左派组织的巨大发展害怕得要死。
    文章说：宫本修正主义集团就是这样害怕左派队伍的发展，在革命的群众中越来越孤立，越来越陷于众叛亲离。我们一定要更加努力建设真正的无产阶级革命政党，在全国各地树起左派党组织的大旗，更大规模地进行反修斗争，加紧追击，给宫本之流以更严重的打击。文章指出：全国忠于革命的党员一定会按照自己的革命意志，勇敢地站起来，团结在左派的旗帜下。宫本集团的反革命奴隶主义枷锁正在一个又一个地被砸断。任何人也阻挡不住这种革命的造反行动。
