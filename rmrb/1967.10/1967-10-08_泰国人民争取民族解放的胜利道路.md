The Thai people, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, are advancing victoriously with the banner of revolutionary armed struggle. In the first nine months of this year, the Thai people's armed forces launched 269 attacks, annihilating over 400 enemy troops, and dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Prapas co-sellout clique.

Over the past two years, the Thai people's armed forces have repeatedly smashed the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, growing from small to large and steadily expanding. Armed struggle has spread from the Northeast to the South, North, and Central regions, covering vast areas. The development of the Thai people's armed struggle signifies the upsurge of the Thai people's revolutionary movement, shaking the criminal rule of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries. The head of the Thai reactionary government, Thanom, lamented that he could not "suppress" the people's armed forces. The victory of the Thai people's armed struggle is a victory for people's war, a victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

The Thai people's armed struggle is an important part of the struggle of the peoples of Southeast Asia against U.S. imperialist aggression. It directly strikes at the U.S. imperialists' plan to expand the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula, strongly supporting the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and making important contributions to the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

U.S. imperialism has long made Thailand an important military base and new colony in Southeast Asia. Apart from heavily backing the Thanom sellout clique, it has stationed over 60,000 invading troops in Thailand, controlling important strategic strongholds, and directly participating in the suppression of the Thai people's revolutionary struggle.

U.S. imperialism thought that by directly controlling Thailand and placing it under its bayonets, it could prevent the Thai revolution from happening and use Thailand as it pleased as a base for invading Vietnam and a springboard for attacking China. However, the rapid development of the Thai revolutionary situation has shattered U.S. imperialism's sweet dreams.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance; the deeper the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The more ferociously U.S. imperialism and its lackeys suppress the Thai people, the more it drives the Thai people to rise up and wage a national democratic revolution to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and feudalism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out to the revolutionary people of the world the great truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally applicable, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Thai Communist Party resolutely led the Thai people to take up arms and engage in a brave struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. It was in the Northeast region, where U.S. imperialist military bases are concentrated, that the Thai people lit the torch of armed struggle. It was under the direct suppression of U.S. imperialism that the flames of armed struggle burned brighter and brighter. This fact fully demonstrates that even in a country heavily guarded by U.S. imperialist troops, where U.S. military bases are densely packed, and where extreme fascist rule is enforced, as long as the revolutionary people have correct leadership, possess the daring spirit to fight and win, and unite all possible forces, then not only can armed struggle be launched, but it can also be sustained and ultimately victorious.

Under the circumstances of the enemy being strong and the self being weak, the Thai people's armed forces have boldly mobilized the peasant masses, strengthened political and ideological work, and employed the flexible and mobile strategies and tactics of guerrilla warfare, ensuring the victorious development of armed struggle.

Although U.S. imperialism has spared no effort to establish its colonial rule in Thailand, the vast rural areas are beyond its control. The countryside is the weak link in the U.S.-Thai reactionary rule and the vast expanse where revolutionaries can roam freely. The broad peasant masses, who have suffered deeply from national and class oppression, have strong revolutionary demands, harbor immense revolutionary potential, and are the main force of the national democratic revolution. The people's armed forces led by the Thai Communist Party have focused their work on the countryside. They have long been deeply involved in the countryside, conducting painstaking and meticulous mobilization and organizational work, accumulating and tempering their strength. In this way, they have been able to gradually establish and expand the bases of armed struggle, and after a long struggle, form the encirclement of the cities from the countryside, ultimately seizing the cities and winning nationwide victory.

The Thai people have used the gun to create a great revolutionary situation, providing another brilliant example for all oppressed nations and peoples in the world to struggle for independence and liberation. No matter how much U.S. imperialism and its lackeys intensify their suppression, the flames of the Thai people's armed struggle cannot be extinguished. The heroic Thai people, walking the path of people's war, walking the path of Mao Zedong, will surely defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and win complete liberation.

    泰国人民争取民族解放的胜利道路
　　本报评论员
    泰国人民正在泰国共产党的领导下，高举着革命武装斗争的旗帜，胜利前进。今年头九个月，泰国人民武装出击二百六十九次，歼敌四百余人，沉重打击了美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团。
    两年多来，泰国人民武装力量多次粉碎敌人的“围剿”，从小到大，逐步地发展壮大起来。武装斗争已经从东北部扩大到南部、北部和中部等广大地区。泰国人民武装斗争的发展，标志着泰国人民革命运动的高涨，动摇了美泰反动派在泰国的罪恶统治。泰国反动政府头子他侬哀叹，无法把人民武装“镇压下去”。泰国人民武装斗争的胜利，是人民战争的胜利，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利。
    泰国人民的武装斗争，是东南亚人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争的一个重要组成部分。它直接打击了美帝国主义企图把战争扩大到整个印度支那的侵略计划，有力地支援了正在英勇地进行着抗美救国斗争的越南人民，对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动作出了重要的贡献。
    美帝国主义早已把泰国作为它在东南亚的重要军事基地和新殖民地。它除了大力扶植他侬卖国集团之外，还在泰国驻扎了六万多侵略军，控制了泰国重要的战略据点，并且直接参与镇压泰国人民的革命斗争。
    美帝国主义以为，它只要把泰国直接控制起来，置于它的刺刀之下，就可以防止泰国革命的发生，就可以随心所欲地利用泰国作为它侵略越南的基地和进攻中国的跳板。但是，泰国革命形势的迅速发展，惊破了美帝国主义的酣梦。
    有压迫，就有反抗；压迫愈深，反抗也就愈烈。美帝国主义及其走狗对泰国人民的镇压愈是凶恶，就愈促使泰国人民起来，进行民族民主革命，推翻帝国主义和封建主义的反动统治。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席向全世界革命人民指出了“枪杆子里面出政权”这个伟大的真理。“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    泰国共产党在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，果断地领导泰国人民拿起武器，同美国侵略者及其走狗展开英勇的搏斗。正是在美帝国主义军事基地集中的东北部地区，泰国人民点起了武装斗争的火炬。正是在美帝国主义直接参与镇压的情况下，武装斗争的怒火越烧越旺。这个事实充分说明了，即使在一个美帝国主义重兵把守、美军基地林立、实行极端残暴的法西斯统治的国家里，革命人民只要有正确的领导，具有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏精神，团结一切可以团结的力量，那末，就不仅能够发动武装斗争，而且能够坚持下去，取得最后的胜利。
    在敌强我弱的形势下，泰国人民武装力量放手发动农民群众，加强了政治思想工作，运用了游击战争的灵活机动的战略战术，保证了武装斗争的胜利发展。
    美帝国主义虽然煞费苦心在泰国建立它的殖民统治，但是广大农村却是它无法控制的。农村，是美泰反动统治的薄弱环节，是革命者纵横驰骋的广阔天地。饱受民族压迫和阶级压迫的广大的农民群众，具有强烈的革命要求，蕴藏着巨大的革命潜力，是民族民主革命的主力军。泰国共产党领导的人民武装力量，把自己的工作重点放在农村。他们长期深入农村，进行艰苦细致的动员和组织工作，积蓄和锻炼自己的力量。这样，他们就能逐步建立和扩大武装斗争的根据地，经过长期的斗争，形成农村包围城市的局面，最后夺取城市，夺取全国的胜利。
    泰国人民用枪杆子打出了一个大好的革命形势，为全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民提供了争取独立和解放的又一个光辉榜样。不管美帝国主义及其走狗怎样加紧镇压，泰国人民武装斗争的烈火是扑不灭的。英雄的泰国人民，走人民战争的道路，走毛泽东的道路，就一定能够打败美帝国主义及其走狗，赢得彻底的解放。
