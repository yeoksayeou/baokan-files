Hanoi Military and Civilians Achieve Consecutive Victories, Shooting Down 10 U.S. Planes in One Day

The heroic military and civilians of Hanoi achieved three consecutive victories. On the 26th, they shot down 10 U.S. aggressor planes that invaded Hanoi, damaged several, and captured multiple American pilots. Thus, in three days, the military and civilians of Hanoi have shot down a total of 23 U.S. aggressor planes.

On the 26th, in the middle of the day, multiple batches of U.S. aggressor planes invaded Hanoi's airspace and continuously bombed the densely populated residential areas of Hanoi for the third consecutive day. This is a serious act of war "escalation" by U.S. imperialism. The various armed forces defending the capital, filled with deep hatred for the enemy, immediately bravely intercepted the U.S. aggressor planes. Various calibers of weapons were fired fiercely and accurately. Many enemy planes were hit and caught fire in the initial few rounds of artillery fire, crashing immediately and turning to dust. The pilots who parachuted were all captured alive.

The military and civilians of Ha Tay Province, on the 26th, in the middle of the day, closely coordinated with the military and civilians of Hanoi, also shot down two U.S. aggressor planes.

Additionally, it was reported that the military and civilians of Hai Phong City shot down three U.S. aggressor planes during the battle on the 22nd.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 25th, strongly condemning the new war "escalation" crimes of the U.S. sending aggressor planes to brutally bomb the urban and suburban areas of Hanoi in recent days.

The statement pointed out that in the past two months, U.S. planes have continuously carried out extremely savage attacks on Hai Phong City, the Vinh Yen area, Quang Binh Province, and the demilitarized zone. At the same time, the U.S. has also sent another brigade of American troops to South Vietnam and coerced its lackeys, Australia and New Zealand, to send more mercenary troops. These all clearly show that U.S. President Johnson's recent words about "seeking peace" are merely to deceive public opinion and cover up its cunning means of intensifying the Vietnam War.

The statement warns the U.S. aggressors that the Vietnamese people will resolutely fight to the final victory. The more the U.S. aggressors escalate the war, the more they will suffer heavier defeats.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 22nd, severely condemning the aggressive actions of the Australian and New Zealand governments announcing the increase of troops to South Vietnam. The statement warns the Australian and New Zealand governments that if they insist on acting as lackeys of the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, they will follow the inevitable path of failure of the U.S. aggressors.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns and accuses the Australian and New Zealand governments of their aggressive actions against the Vietnamese people. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the U.S. and the Australian and New Zealand governments must immediately stop sending Australian and New Zealand troops to South Vietnam; the U.S. must stop its aggression against Vietnam, withdraw all American and mercenary troops from South Vietnam, and must unconditionally stop bombing and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and must respect the various basic national rights of the Vietnamese people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, on the 25th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported that the spokesperson of the External Relations Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on the 24th, strongly condemning the reactionary governments of Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand, as lackeys of U.S. imperialism, for following the policy of aggression against Vietnam and sending mercenary troops to South Vietnam.

The statement said that since the U.S. has been sending large numbers of troops to South Vietnam, nearly 250,000 American and mercenary troops have lost their combat effectiveness. This undeniable fact shows that the more troops the U.S. sends to South Vietnam, the more will be destroyed, and its failure is irreversible. The statement once again warns the lackeys of the U.S. that if they blindly follow the U.S., they will also meet the same shameful fate as their American masters.

    河内军民连战连捷一天击落美机十架
    越南外交部强烈谴责美帝野蛮轰炸河内市的战争“升级”罪行
    越外交部和越南南方民族解放阵线谴责美国走狗增兵南越
    新华社河内二十六日电　英雄的河内市军民三战三捷，二十六日又击落侵入河内市的美国强盗飞机十架，击伤多架，活捉美国飞贼多名。这样，河内市军民在三天中共击落美国强盗飞机二十三架。
    二十六日中午，美国强盗飞机多批侵入河内市上空，连续第三天野蛮轰炸河内市居民稠密区。这是美帝国主义的严重的战争“升级”行动。对敌人怀着深刻仇恨的保卫首都的各人民武装力量，立即英勇截击美国强盗飞机，各种口径的武器打得猛，打得准。许多敌机在最初的几排炮火中就中弹起火，当场坠落，摔得粉身碎骨，跳伞的飞贼也被全部活捉。
    河西省军民二十六日中午同河内市军民紧密配合作战，也击落了美国强盗飞机两架。
    另据补充公布，海防市军民在二十二日的战斗中，共击落了美国强盗飞机三架。
    新华社河内二十六日电　越南民主共和国外交部二十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美国连日来派遣强盗飞机野蛮轰炸河内市区和郊区的新的战争“升级”罪行。
    声明指出，近两个月来，美国飞机连续地对海防市、永灵区、广平省和非军事区进行了极其野蛮的袭击。与此同时，美国又向越南南方增派了一个旅的美军，并胁迫它的仆从澳大利亚和新西兰派遣更多的帮凶军。这些都清楚地表明，美国总统约翰逊最近关于“谋求和平”的言词，只不过是为了欺骗舆论和掩盖它加强越南战争的狡诈手段而已。
    声明警告美国侵略者，越南人民坚决战斗到最后胜利。美国侵略者越进行战争“升级”，它们就越会遭到更加惨重的失败。
    据新华社河内电　越南民主共和国外交部二十二日发表声明，严厉谴责澳大利亚当局和新西兰当局宣布向越南南方增兵的侵略行动。声明警告澳大利亚当局和新西兰当局，如果它们一味顽固地充当美国侵略越南的帮凶，它们就将走上美国侵略者必然失败的道路。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府强烈谴责和控诉澳大利亚和新西兰当局对越南人民的侵略行动。越南民主共和国政府要求美国和澳大利亚、新西兰当局必须立即停止向越南南方派遣澳大利亚军队和新西兰军队；美国必须停止对越南的侵略，把美军和帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，必须无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须尊重越南人民的各种基本民族权利。
    据新华社河内二十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人二十四日发表声明，强烈谴责美国走狗泰国、澳大利亚和新西兰反动当局追随美帝国主义侵略越南的政策，向越南南方增派帮凶军的罪恶阴谋。
    声明说，自从美国向南越大肆增兵以来，已有近二十五万美军和帮凶军丧失了战斗力，这个无可辩驳的事实表明，美国向越南南方增兵越多，被消灭的也就越多，它的失败是无可挽救的。声明再次警告美国的仆从，如果他们一味盲目地追随美国，也将会遭到同他们的美国主子一样的可耻下场。
