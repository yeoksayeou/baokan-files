"The Struggle Against Revisionism in the Examination Hall" is a fine piece of material. It vividly records the experience of a Chinese student studying in the Soviet Union three years ago during an examination at a Soviet university.

This examination was not an ordinary one; it was a fierce class struggle: a struggle between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and modern revisionism, a struggle between revolutionary "little people" and reactionary "big shots."

The patriarch of revisionist literature, Sholokhov, is a famous "big shot." From the Soviet revisionist leaders Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin, to the bourgeois masters in the West, all praise him to the skies. The leaders of the revisionist literary black line in our country also worship him as a god. Thus, Sholokhov has become an invincible giant!

Our young student studying abroad, however, "speaks of great men with contempt." He dares to challenge such a reactionary "big shot," daring to touch the tiger's tail. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, he directly targets the famous Sholokhov, criticizing this "big shot's" representative work. It is strange to say, this big mouthpiece for the restoration of capitalism, this patriarch of revisionist literature, this towering "big shot," was poked a few times by a revolutionary "little person," and his thick makeup was torn off, revealing the demon's true face, the paper tiger's true form. The former glory was swept away. The Soviet revisionist teachers who were examining him were at a loss for words, in a sorry state, and had to retreat.

The revolutionary "little person's" speech in the examination hall was righteous and bold, like a sharp dagger and a whistling arrow, piercing the heart of Soviet revisionist literature and frightening the Soviet revisionist writers!

The revolutionary "little person's" speech in the examination hall was high and mighty, like a swift and unstoppable force, greatly boosting the morale of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and greatly dampening the spirit of revisionism!

This revolutionary "little person" is truly outstanding!

"A newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger." Revolutionary "little people," revolutionary "newborn calves," are not afraid of tigers because they are armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought. They do not believe in heaven, earth, gods, or ghosts; they only believe in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They fear neither heaven nor earth, nor gods nor ghosts, daring to despise all reactionary and decadent "big shots," be they "great writers" or "great authorities," none of them matter.

"A small weight can pull down a thousand pounds." "Little people" who grasp Mao Zedong Thought have great morale, strong fighting spirit, keen eyes, and strong power. They not only dare to "treat the former nobles of ten thousand households as dung" and "speak of great men with contempt," but they can also defeat all counter-revolutionary "big shots"! The fact that this young student studying abroad debated with Soviet revisionist teachers and defeated Sholokhov is a vivid example. "Today is even better." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there are tens of thousands of such "little people." They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, charging towards the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, towards all counter-revolutionary "big shots," fighting without fear of defeat, attacking without fail, and establishing immortal merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Let's see who the heroes are today!"

    “说大人则藐之”
    ——赞《考场上的反修斗争》
    辛午
    《考场上的反修斗争》，是一份好材料，它生动地记录了我国一个留苏学生三年前在苏联某高等学校的一场考试经过。
    这场考试，不是一般的考试，而是一场激烈的阶级斗争：马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同现代修正主义的斗争，革命的“小人物”同反动的“大人物”的斗争。
    修正主义文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫，是一个赫赫有名的“大人物”。从苏修领导集团的赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，到西方的资产阶级老爷们，无不把他捧得神乎其神。我国修正主义文艺黑线的头目们，也都把他奉为九天神明。于是乎，这个肖洛霍夫俨然成了一个不可触犯的庞然大物！
    我们这位年轻的留学生，“说大人则藐之”，对于这样一个反动的“大人物”，硬是“勿视其巍巍然”，敢于太岁头上动土，敢于摸老虎屁股。他以毛泽东思想为武器，锋芒直指大名鼎鼎的肖洛霍夫，批判了这个“大人物”的代表作。说也奇怪，这个复辟资本主义的大吹鼓手，这个修正主义文艺的祖师爷，这个巍巍然的“大人物”，被革命的“小人物”戳了这么几指头，厚厚的画皮就被捅破了，妖魔现出了真相，纸老虎显示了原形，昔日威风扫地以尽。主考的苏修教师们也理屈词穷，狼狈不堪，只得败下阵来。
    这个革命“小人物”在考场上的一席谈话，义正词严，理直气壮，犹如一把锋利的匕首，一支飞鸣的响箭，刺进了苏修文艺的心窝，吓破了苏修文人的胆！
    这个革命“小人物”在考场上的一席谈话，高屋建瓴，势如破竹，大长了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的志气，大灭了修正主义的威风！
    这个革命“小人物”真是好样的！
    “初生之犊不怕虎。”革命的“小人物”、革命的“初生之犊”所以“不怕虎”，因为他们是由伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的。他们不信天，不信地，不信神，不信鬼，只信马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。他们天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕，敢于藐视一切反动的、腐朽的“大人物”，什么“大作家”，什么“大权威”，统统不在话下。
    “秤砣虽小坠千斤”。掌握了毛泽东思想的“小人物”，志气大，斗志旺，眼睛亮，力量强，不但敢于“粪土当年万户侯”，“说大人则藐之”，而且能够打败一切反革命的“大人物”！这位年轻的留学生舌战苏修教师，击败肖洛霍夫的事实，就是一个生动的例证。“今朝更好看”。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，这样的“小人物”更是成千上万。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向着党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，向着一切反革命的“大人物”，冲锋陷阵，战无不胜，攻无不克，为无产阶级文化大革命建立了不朽的功勋。
    “数风流人物还看今朝”！
