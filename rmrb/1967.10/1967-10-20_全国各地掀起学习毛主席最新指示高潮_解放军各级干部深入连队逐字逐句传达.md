The entire nation has launched a widespread and in-depth campaign to study, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Military cadres at all levels have gone deep into the ranks to convey these instructions word for word and sentence by sentence.

Hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians have placed the study, propaganda, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position that is greater than everything, higher than everything, heavier than everything, and more urgent than everything. They are determined to study them deeply and thoroughly, to implement them resolutely, sentence by sentence and word by word, to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage.

Xinhua News Agency, October 19th: The extremely important instructions given by our great leader Chairman Mao during his recent inspection of the North China, Central South, and East China regions have sparked a widespread and in-depth movement to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions across the country. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres are excitedly saying: The extremely important series of instructions given by our great leader Chairman Mao recently on the need to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, to further promote revolutionary unity, the three-in-one combination, and to hold extensive study classes, are great historical documents of Marxism-Leninism. They are the most scientific, most complete, most profound, and most thorough summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and a half. They are the beacon guiding the entire Party, the nation, and the army to advance courageously. They are the most powerful ideological weapon to ensure the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must study them seriously, propagate them extensively, understand them deeply, and implement them resolutely, sentence by sentence and word by word. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the capital have placed the study, propaganda, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position that is greater than everything, higher than everything, heavier than everything, and more urgent than everything, sparking a wave of mass study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison Command have successively held mobilization meetings to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, issuing decisions on seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's important instructions. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Dyeing Factory, which has achieved revolutionary unity by workshop and department, have linked the study and discussion of Chairman Mao's latest instructions with reality, fought against selfishness, further consolidated revolutionary unity by system, and promoted the three-in-one combination. The majority of the members of the recently established Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee have gone deep into communes, factories, enterprises, and institutions to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the masses. The county revolutionary committee has also dispatched a large number of cadres to form propaganda teams to go to the countryside to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism with the broad masses of commune members, promoted revolution, and increased production. The members of the school and department revolutionary committees of Beijing Agricultural University and the class cultural revolution small groups, after receiving Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have taken the lead in studying and applying them, and have fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism with revolutionary teachers and students, basically achieving revolutionary unity by class.

The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee recently issued a notice on resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and held a report meeting. Zhang Chunqiao, a leading member of the municipal revolutionary committee, conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the report meeting. In recent days, the entire city of Shanghai, in various districts, systems, and departments, has taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The broad masses of cadres, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, and Red Guards participating in the study have, through the study of the "Old Five Articles," fought against selfishness, fiercely criticized revisionism, and firmly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionary young people in schools, during the study, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrating their firepower on non-proletarian thoughts. Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues have greatly encouraged the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary cadres of Shanghai. Revolutionary cadres say, we resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, expand the scope of education, unite the majority, dare to liberate a large area, and bravely strike a small handful.

The standing committee members of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and summed up the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and a half. The provincial revolutionary committee has also issued an urgent notice to various regions (cities), counties, revolutionary committees, and revolutionary mass organizations, requiring them to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, understand them deeply, and implement them resolutely. The standing committee members of the Shandong Provincial and Jinan Municipal Revolutionary Committees have also, in accordance with the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better," left a small number of standing committee members in the office to handle daily work, while the majority of standing committee members have gone deep into factories, schools, and other grassroots units, eating, living, and working with the revolutionary masses, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes together, and fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. The Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Revolutionary Command Headquarters, the Red Guards Shandong Command, and other revolutionary mass organizations have all taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, and formulated specific measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee passed a resolution on October 18th to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions, calling on the entire province's military and civilians to immediately launch a wave of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions. Currently, from the Miao Mountains to the banks of the Wujiang River, from the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi to the Wumeng Mountains, large Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have gone deep into the grassroots, extensively propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many factories, people's communes, institutions, schools, and neighborhoods have held mobilization meetings, seminars, and study report meetings. The revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses of Zunyi, Xingyi, and Bijie prefectures have shown a new situation of revolutionary unity after studying Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions.

A widespread and unprecedented movement to study, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions has swept across the entire province of Heilongjiang. Many counties and cities have organized propaganda teams of several hundred to over a thousand people, going deep into factories, neighborhoods, schools, and rural areas to propagate Chairman Mao's important instructions; some county and city revolutionary committees' main responsible persons have conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses and fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism with the revolutionary masses.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in Shanxi Province have resolutely stated: We must print Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions, using the great thought of Mao Zedong to command everything, transform everything, and promote everything, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The revolutionary committee of the Taiyuan Transformer Factory held a mobilization meeting to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and mobilized the broad revolutionary workers to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a guide, summing up the experience of the cultural revolution over the past year and a half, strengthening political and ideological work on cadres, enabling more revolutionary cadres to take up leadership positions, and further consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting of the revolutionary committee on October 17th and 18th to specially study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The meeting decided to use various propaganda tools to launch large-scale propaganda activities, making them known to every household and person. It was required that revolutionary committees (preparatory groups) at all levels and revolutionary mass organizations formulate plans and measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, launching a new wave of active learning and application of Mao Zedong's works, a new wave of revolutionary criticism and rectification of the unit, a new wave of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, a new wave of supporting the army and loving the people, and a new wave of promoting revolution and production and increasing production and saving, to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, October 19th: In the magnificent movement to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the leading cadres of the People's Liberation Army, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, have traversed mountains and rivers, rushed to grassroots units, frontline islands, border outposts, and the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word. Wherever they convey Chairman Mao's instructions, there is a wave of excitement. The broad masses of soldiers and officers are extremely excited, saying that the extremely important series of instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China are the highest mobilization order for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the greatest driving force for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers and officers enthusiastically respond to the call of the Central Military Commission, determined to study them seriously, propagate them extensively, understand them deeply, and implement them without any deviation.

In recent days, many old Red Army soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in battles north and south, many outstanding commanders and political workers who have experienced countless battles, have carried Chairman Mao's latest instructions, shouldered their bags, and with high spirits, day and night, gone deep into the ranks, airfields, ships, and outposts, conveying and explaining to the soldiers word for word and sentence by sentence. They said, the earlier the soldiers hear Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the earlier they will obtain the greatest happiness, and the earlier they will obtain the greatest strength. Many leading cadres of the Navy, Air Force, and the Beijing, Wuhan, Jinan, Shenyang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, and other units, when conveying and explaining at the grassroots units, some combined the current good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to extol the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions; some used their personal experiences of following Chairman Mao in revolution to repeatedly explain the truth that acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions is victory. Some, before the explanation, held seminars to understand the soldiers' active thoughts, and during the explanation, linked them with reality, making the soldiers understand more deeply. In Jiangxi, where Chairman Mao inspected, the local garrison unit, except for leaving one leading cadre to take care of daily work, the rest, under the leadership of Political Commissar Xu Lianfa, immediately dispersed to various small teams executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks. Xu Lianfa, without hesitation, walked more than seventy miles in one go, and as soon as he arrived at the ranks, he began to explain. The mess hall hadn't heard, so he went to the mess hall to explain. The Signal Corps unit conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every soldier in a very short time. This unit had a soldier on duty more than ten miles away from the garrison. To ensure no one was missed, the leading cadres specially went to convey to him. In the Northeast forest area, it is now the season of heavy snow and bitter cold. The leading cadres of the Railway Engineering Corps unit, upon receiving Chairman Mao's latest instructions, immediately formed a joyous team, braving the wind and snow, rushed to the construction sites scattered in the deep forest, and explained to the cadres and soldiers of more than twenty units. Wherever the joyous team went, there was excitement and jumping. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoed through the forest.

In the southeastern coastal areas, the units stationed in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan Island have all sent their leading cadres to high mountain outposts, frontline islands far from the mainland, frontline airfields on high alert, and naval vessels patrolling at sea to convey the good news to the heroic soldiers defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The party committee of a certain unit on Nanri Island in Fujian, upon receiving Chairman Mao's latest instructions, immediately set sail, braving the waves, rushed to the water-based teams dozens of miles away and the independent teams working on land reclamation, reading each word to every soldier and leading a serious discussion. The leading cadres of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Army, with bags on their backs, crossed mountains and valleys to explain to the ranks, and then fought against selfishness with the soldiers, criticized revisionism, and fought against selfishness. On Hainan Island, the soldiers and officers of a certain "Four Good" radar station who have been guarding the mountain top for seventeen years, upon hearing the conveyance, immediately expressed in front of the radar screen: They will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's extremely important series of instructions such as "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," "promoting revolution, production, work, and preparedness," and forever be good "thousand-mile eyes" of the motherland and red guards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On a certain naval unit, some vessels are patrolling in the open sea. The leading cadres convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the vessels through signals and telegrams. The sailors gather on the deck, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing "The Great Helmsman Steers Us Across the Seas," determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a beacon, bravely advance in the great waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

On the long border lines of the motherland, various units have also responded swiftly, widely and deeply conveying and explaining Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the Dianxiangbei Plateau's Dulong River Valley, there is a very dispersed border unit. This unit is blocked from the higher-level leadership by a snow-capped mountain over 4,000 meters high. Now, with the mountain covered in snow and transportation difficult, the unit's responsible person immediately conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word and sentence by sentence over the phone. The party branch, upon receiving the phone call, immediately dispatched people to cross mountains and cliffs to convey to the soldiers on duty hundreds of miles away. The soldiers, upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, excitedly said: No matter how high the mountain is, it cannot block the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao; no matter how far the road is, it cannot cut off the soldiers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. In the Zhongxi border of Tibet, the responsible person Wang Baogong of a certain unit rushed through the night to bring Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the heroic border soldiers. The soldiers at the Naqula Pass were very excited and expressed their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, be ready for battle at any time, and firmly repel any provocations from the Indian aggressors, achieving new merits for the people in defending the national defense and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang, various border units have widely used telegraphs, telephones, and other communication tools to convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to border outposts and dispersed duty units in a timely manner. The soldiers guarding the border day and night are determined to consciously fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism in the movement to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, turning the outposts and checkpoints into red Mao Zedong Thought schools, and building an iron wall against revisionism and preventing revisionism.
