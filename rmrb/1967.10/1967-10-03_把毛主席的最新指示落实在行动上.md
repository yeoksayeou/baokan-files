On the glorious National Day, we heard from the radio the joyous news of Chairman Mao ascending the Tiananmen Gate and Comrade Lin Biao's extremely important speech. We cheered and jumped for joy, overjoyed. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest support for us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Comrade Lin Biao, in his speech, conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self." This is the guiding principle for achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will do as Chairman Mao says, fearing neither knife-edge mountains nor raging fires, and remaining steadfast as rocks and stones. We will imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, infuse them into our blood, and implement them in our actions. We will firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and create new achievements for the revolution.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Only by thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the 'self' can we carry the struggle against revisionism through to the end." This is an absolute truth. As the saying goes, "A single leaf can obscure the view of Mount Tai." If there is a "self" in one's mind, it is often difficult to see the correct direction of the struggle and waver in the midst of intense class struggle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the soul. Only by repudiating the "self" can we thoroughly uproot the breeding ground for capitalist restoration; only by destroying the bourgeois kingdom in our minds can we thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. Therefore, we must critically examine our souls, repudiate the "self," and resolutely overcome sectarianism, cliquism, and other petty-bourgeois tendencies. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, promote the great criticism and great unity of the revolution, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao. We will ride the wind and break the waves forward, striving to make Wuhan a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    把毛主席的最新指示落实在行动上
    武汉钢二司　新华工革命委员会
    在光辉的国庆节日里，从广播里听到毛主席登上天安门城楼的喜讯和林副主席的极为重要的讲话，我们欢呼跳跃，欣喜若狂。这是毛主席对我们无产阶级革命派的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大支持。
    林副统帅在讲话里，传达了毛主席关于“斗私，批修”的最新指示，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利的指南。毛主席怎样说的，我们就怎样做，刀山火海无所惧，海枯石烂不变心。我们要把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，为革命立新功。
    林副主席说：“只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”这是千真万确的真理。俗话说：“一叶障目，不见泰山。”头脑里有一个“私”字，就往往会看不清斗争的大方向，在剧烈的阶级斗争中左右摇摆。无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，只有斗掉了“私”字，才能彻底铲除资本主义复辟的温床；只有摧毁自己头脑里的资产阶级王国，才能彻底地摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。因此，我们要狠触自己的灵魂，狠斗“私”字，坚决克服山头主义、小团体主义等等小资产阶级派性，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，做革命的大批判和革命的大联合的促进派。我们决心永远跟着毛主席，乘风破浪向前进，为把武汉办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
