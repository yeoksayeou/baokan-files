	Sing Loudly the "East is Red"
		Liao Daqian

	Ten thousand red flags dance in the east wind,
	Five lakes and four seas are in harmony,
	Joyfully celebrating National Day,
	Millions sing "East is Red" together.

	Sing loudly the "East is Red",
	Great teacher Mao Zedong,
	Leads workers and peasants in revolution,
	Shatters the chains and frees the dragon.

	From Mount Jigang to Beijing,
	Crossing countless obstacles,
	Every step is a victorious path,
	All thanks to the savior Mao Zedong.

	Sing loudly the "East is Red",
	Great leader Mao Zedong,
	With a grand plan to create great achievements,
	The country's rivers and mountains take on a new look.

	Red flowers bloom everywhere in Dazhai,
	The spirit of Daqing shines brightly,
	Nuclear bombs shake the enemy's courage,
	Steel flowers light up the sky...

	Sing loudly the "East is Red",
	Great commander Mao Zedong,
	On Tiananmen Square, he waves his mighty hand,
	The cultural revolution surges forward.

	Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians rise up,
	Sweeping away all harmful pests,
	Rooting out revisionism,
	The great motherland will be red for generations to come.

	Sing loudly the "East is Red",
	Great helmsman Mao Zedong,
	In wind and waves, we follow you,
	Step by step, we achieve new victories.

	Looking ahead with joy at Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
	The wind and thunder roar, the fire burns brightly,
	People of the world follow you,
	Swearing to make the universe red.

	Joyfully celebrating National Day,
	Five lakes and four seas are in harmony,
	Every red heart turns to Beijing,
	Millions sing "East is Red" together.
