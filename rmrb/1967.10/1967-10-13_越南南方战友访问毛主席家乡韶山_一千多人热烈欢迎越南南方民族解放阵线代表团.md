	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, Changsha, October 12th - The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, coming from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, visited the hometown of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, Shaoshan, today with immense excitement. Vietnamese South friends praised the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought during their visit.

	The mountains surrounding Shaoshan village were adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums and music, creating a warm atmosphere of proletarian internationalist combat friendship. More than a thousand revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaoshan formed long lines to welcome the Vietnamese South friends, expressing the deep affection of the people of Shaoshan for the people of Vietnam.

	Upon arriving in Shaoshan, the Vietnamese South friends enthusiastically visited Chairman Mao's former residence, observing the bedroom where he once lived, the tools he used, and the places where he conducted revolutionary activities. They listened attentively to the guide's explanation of Chairman Mao's early revolutionary activities in his hometown. Competitive warriors from the South, such as Le Zhi Yuan, also took detailed notes. Afterwards, they braved the rain to visit the threshing ground where Chairman Mao worked and the pond where he swam.

	The Vietnamese South friends were very happy and excited to personally learn about Chairman Mao's glorious youth and his honorable revolutionary family in Shaoshan. Team leader Nguyen Van Dan wrote in the visitor's book: "The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is extremely excited to visit the hometown of our beloved Chairman Mao. Through this visit, we have learned the spirit of thorough revolution from Chairman Mao. At the same time, we have come to know the great teacher and leader of the Chinese people who was born in Shaoshan. We, the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, sincerely wish Chairman Mao eternal life."

	Before leaving, the Chinese and Vietnamese comrades had a very friendly conversation, exchanging gifts with each other.

	Tonight, the Vietnamese South friends met with the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in Changsha and watched revolutionary art performances by the Hunan Province Puppet Shadow Play Troupe, which had previously visited Vietnam.
