	Carry the Campaign of "Criticizing the Self and Opposing Revisionism" Through to the End
	Shanghai Tongji University Revolutionary Committee, Dongfanghong Detachment

	“It is better to pursue the enemy to the bitter end than to let the enemy off the hook like Xiang Yu.” After studying Comrade Lin Biao’s important speech at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and the editorial by the editorial departments of the People’s Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily, “Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,” we reviewed the year’s battle with pride. We revolutionary rebels are fully aware that only by following Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment can we achieve one victory after another.

	Now Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee call on us to “criticize the self and oppose revisionism.” This is the fundamental policy for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We revolutionary Red Guards will carry it out a thousand times and follow it a million times.

	Opposing revisionism means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and to struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Liu Shaoqi is the chief representative of Chinese revisionism, the protector of ghosts and monsters. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrate our targets, and concentrate our firepower to criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by Liu Shaoqi, and make them stink for ten thousand years.

	The educational revolution is an important part of the cultural revolution. Whether the educational revolution is successful or not is a major issue concerning what kind of people the school will cultivate in the future. Therefore, the educational revolution is a matter of great importance for a hundred years and a thousand years. The old educational system and old teaching methods are traditions that have been passed down for thousands of years. To completely overthrow them and eliminate their poisonous influence, we must exert great effort. However, we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We are not afraid of any difficulties. We are determined to carry forward the great revolutionary spirit and launch a magnificent educational revolution, achieving new successes in the educational revolution.

	Criticizing the self is essential for opposing revisionism. Only by thoroughly criticizing the “self” can we better carry the struggle against revisionism through to the end. In our ranks, various non-proletarian thoughts still exist. For example, some people think that sitting down is boring, while running around outside is exciting; some even use the excuse of “liberating oneself” to say that no one can control them, which is a serious anarchist trend. Various petty-bourgeois thoughts seriously hinder the deep development of the great criticism. Comrade Lin Biao’s speech has timely educated us, making us deeply realize the harmfulness of the “self” and the importance of criticizing the self. The “self” is the commodity peddled by Liu Shaoqi. If we do not thoroughly criticize the “self,” we cannot talk about revolution, and opposing revisionism would be just empty talk. We resolutely take “criticizing the self and opposing revisionism” as the guideline, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao’s works in the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit, guiding the petty-bourgeois thoughts in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. We must both regard ourselves as a revolutionary force and continuously regard ourselves as the object of revolution, thoroughly criticize the “self,” promote the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit—the educational revolution, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination.

	At this historic moment when the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, the class enemies are not willing to accept their doom. We must heighten our vigilance and be ready at any time to smash the evil plots of a handful of people to shake the leadership of Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters from the right and the ultra-“left.” We must follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

### 把“斗私，批修”进行到底

    把“斗私，批修”进行到底
    上海同济大学革命委员会、东方红兵团
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们学习了林副主席在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上的重要讲话和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部文章《无产阶级专政下的文化大革命胜利万岁》之后，以自豪的心情回顾了一年的战斗历程，我们无产阶级革命派非常清醒地知道：只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，才能取得一个又一个的胜利。
    现在毛主席、党中央又号召我们要“斗私，批修”，这是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的根本方针。我们革命的红卫兵，一千个执行，一万个照办。
    批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫是中国修正主义的总后台，是牛鬼蛇神的保护伞，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，集中目标，集中火力，批倒批臭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，使他们遗臭万年。
    教育革命是文化大革命的重要组成部分，教育革命搞得好不好，是关系到今后学校培养什么人的大问题，因此教育革命是百年大计，千年大计。旧教育制度和旧教学方法，是几千年来的习惯传统，彻底推翻它，肃清它的流毒，要花很大的气力。但是我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，什么困难也不怕。我们决心发扬大无畏的革命精神，把轰轰烈烈的教育革命开展起来，在教育革命中立新功。
    批修必须斗私。只有很好地斗掉了“私”字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。在我们的队伍中，至今还存在着种种非无产阶级思想。例如：有的认为坐下来乏味，不如在外面冲冲有劲；甚至还有少数人借口什么“自己解放自己”，谁也管不了，实际上是严重的无政府主义思潮。形形色色的小资产阶级思想，严重地影响了革命大批判的深入开展。林副主席的讲话，及时地教育了我们，使我们深刻地认识到“私”字的危害性和斗私的重要性。“私”字就是中国赫鲁晓夫兜售的货色，如果不狠斗“私”字，那就根本谈不上革命，批修也就成了一句空话。我们坚决以“斗私，批修”为纲，在革命大批判和本单位的斗批改中，活学活用毛主席著作，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想，引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。我们既要把自己当作革命的力量，又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象，狠斗“私”字，促进革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改——教育革命，巩固和发展革命的大联合和“三结合”。
    在史无前例的文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利的今天，阶级敌人是不甘心自己的灭亡的。我们必须提高警惕，时刻准备粉碎一小撮人从右的方面和极“左”的方面动摇毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的罪恶阴谋，给予坚决的回击。我们要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
