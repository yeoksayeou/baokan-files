The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram on the 9th to the patriotic overseas Chinese in the Medan concentration camp who are suffering brutal persecution by the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia. The telegram praises their heroic deeds of solemnly celebrating the glorious national day of our great socialist motherland in the concentration camp under the dark and white terror. The telegram expresses the most sincere condolences to the martyrs and the most heartfelt greetings to the patriotic overseas Chinese who are still suffering in the concentration camp.

The telegram strongly condemns the fascist crime committed by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime on October 1st, when they sent a large number of armed military police to brutally suppress the patriotic overseas Chinese in the Medan concentration camp who were celebrating the glorious national day of our great motherland, killing five overseas Chinese on the spot and injuring and arresting many others. The telegram points out that this is another serious anti-China crime planned by the Indonesian reactionaries at the same time as they were crazily attacking and destroying the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and injuring our diplomatic staff.

The telegram says: We are filled with indignation and strongly condemn the new fascist atrocities of anti-China and expulsion of Chinese by the Indonesian reactionaries. We express our deepest condolences to the martyrs and our most heartfelt greetings to the wounded patriotic overseas Chinese and all the suffering overseas Chinese in the concentration camp!

The telegram says: Under the white terror, you have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the dark concentration camp, you have heroically and solemnly celebrated the glorious national day of our great motherland—the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. You have raised the solemn five-star red flag and sung the national anthem and "The East Is Red," showing your boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the socialist motherland. This is a heavy blow to the crazed anti-China Indonesian reactionary government. The Indonesian reactionaries openly sent a large number of armed military police to storm the venue and open fire on you. You resolutely defended yourselves and bravely fought back, engaging in a fierce struggle with the reactionary military police. Your just struggle expresses the deep feelings of the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese who love their motherland and Chairman Mao. It powerfully demonstrates that overseas Chinese and the great motherland are inseparable, and that no fascist bandits can sever this bond. Overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought are indomitable and fearless, daring to struggle and daring to win.

The telegram says: You have been forcibly deported to the Medan concentration camp by the Indonesian reactionaries for more than a year, enduring all kinds of torture and persecution. In the struggle, you have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought as your guiding beacon, uniting as one, bravely unyielding, and fighting on. You have weathered the storms and waves, defended the dignity of the motherland, maintained national dignity, and repelled the enemy's repeated attacks. With your heroic struggle, you have composed song after song of victory for Mao Zedong Thought, setting a brilliant example for the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese. You are truly the heroic sons and daughters of the socialist motherland, truly the good overseas Chinese nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We salute you! We learn from you!

The telegram strongly condemns the Indonesian reactionaries, who, following the instructions of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, deliberately aim to completely destroy the relations between China and Indonesia and become even more rampant in their anti-China and expulsion of Chinese policies. The telegram says: If they continue to act recklessly, they will surely suffer a crushing defeat. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The more rampant the internal and external dark forces are, the more disasters they bring to the nation; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows that they are in their last struggle, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory."

The telegram points out: The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is sitting on the volcano of armed struggle by the Indonesian people and is in a serious political and economic crisis. The Indonesian people will surely send them to the gallows and give them the severest punishment.

The telegram says: Over the past year, the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victories, exposing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and defeating them completely; the ideological revolutionization of the people nationwide has consolidated our proletarian dictatorship and promoted a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production. Our great motherland has never been as prosperous, flourishing, and strong as it is today. The people of the motherland are full of vigor and fighting spirit, advancing victoriously along the revolutionary course indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao. The great motherland is a strong backing for the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The people of the motherland are always deeply concerned about you and firmly support your just struggle. The 700 million people of the motherland will forever be the strong backing for the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

The telegram concludes by saying: We hope that when your situation becomes more difficult and dangerous, you will redouble your efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen your unity with the Indonesian people, and welcome more violent storms and more severe tests. "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory."

    新华社十二日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会，九日向遭受印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权残酷迫害的棉兰集中营爱国侨胞致慰问电，表彰他们在暗无天日、白色恐怖下的集中营里，不畏强暴，隆重庆祝伟大的社会主义祖国的光辉节日——中华人民共和国成立十八周年的英勇事迹，对他们表示最亲切的慰问，对壮烈牺牲的爱国侨胞表示最深切的悼念。
    慰问电强烈谴责苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权在十月一日公然出动大批武装军警，残酷镇压棉兰集中营爱国侨胞庆祝伟大祖国国庆节的活动，当场枪杀侨胞五人，打伤和逮捕侨胞多人的法西斯罪行。慰问电指出，这是印尼反动派在疯狂袭击、捣毁我国驻印尼大使馆，打伤我外交工作人员的同时，所预谋进行的疯狂反华的又一严重罪行。
    慰问电说：我们怀着无比愤怒的心情，最最强烈谴责印尼反动派的反华排华法西斯新暴行。我们对壮烈牺牲的爱国侨胞表示最深切的悼念，向光荣负伤的爱国侨胞和在集中营的全体受难侨胞致以最亲切的慰问！
    慰问电说：你们在白色恐怖的环境中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在暗无天日的集中营里，英勇地隆重庆祝伟大祖国的光辉节日——中华人民共和国成立十八周年。你们升起了庄严的五星红旗，高唱国歌和《东方红》，表现了对伟大领袖毛主席和社会主义祖国的无限热爱、无限忠诚，是对疯狂反华的印尼反动政府的一个沉重打击。印尼反动派公然派遣大批武装军警冲进会场，向你们开枪射击。你们坚决自卫，英勇还击，同反动军警展开了激烈的搏斗。你们的正义斗争，表达了广大爱国侨胞心向祖国、热爱毛主席的深厚感情，有力地表明了海外华侨和伟大祖国是血肉相连的，不是任何法西斯匪徒的屠刀所能割断的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的华侨，是压不服、吓不倒的，是敢于斗争，敢于胜利的。
    慰问电说：你们被印尼反动派强行逼迁到棉兰集中营，已长达一年多的时间，饱受了种种折磨和迫害。你们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，以光焰无际的毛泽东思想作指路明灯，团结一致，英勇不屈，前赴后继，坚持斗争。你们顶黑风、战恶浪，维护祖国尊严，坚持民族气节，击退了敌人一次又一次的进攻。你们以自己的英勇斗争，谱写了一曲又一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌，为广大爱国华侨树立了光辉的榜样。你们不愧是社会主义祖国的英雄儿女，不愧是毛泽东思想哺育下的好侨胞。我们向你们致敬！向你们学习！
    慰问电强烈谴责印尼反动派秉承美帝和苏修的意旨，蓄意彻底破坏中国和印尼两国关系，更猖狂地反华排华。慰问电说：他们这样蛮干下去，势必碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨。正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”
    慰问电指出：苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，正坐在印尼人民武装斗争的火山口上，陷入严重的政治和经济危机之中。印尼人民终将把他们送上绞刑架，给他们以最严厉的惩罚。
    慰问电说：一年多以来，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利，揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们打得落花流水，全面崩溃；全国人民思想的革命化，巩固了我国的无产阶级专政，推动了工农业生产的新高涨。我们的伟大祖国，从来没有象今天这样兴盛、繁荣、强大。祖国七亿人民意气风发，斗志昂扬，正在沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命航道胜利前进。伟大的祖国是印尼爱国侨胞的强大靠山。祖国人民无时不在深切地关怀着你们，坚决支持你们的正义斗争。祖国七亿人民永远是印尼爱国侨胞的坚强后盾。
    慰问电最后说：我们希望，你们在处境越困难、越险恶的时候，越要加倍努力活学活用毛主席著作，越要同印尼人民加强团结，迎接更猛烈的风暴，经受更严峻的考验。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
