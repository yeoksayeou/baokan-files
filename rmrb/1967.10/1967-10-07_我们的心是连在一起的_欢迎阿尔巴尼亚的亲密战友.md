Our Hearts Are United
— Welcoming the Close Comrades from Albania

The Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Ballet Troupe

On the occasion of celebrating the 18th anniversary of our great national day, when our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved further victories, the amateur art troupe from Tirana, Albania, "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun," came to our country for a visit and performance. This fills us with immense excitement and joy. We have visited heroic Albania before, and this time, being able to meet many familiar comrades again, we feel especially happy. We welcome with the warmest of hearts our close comrades from the Eagle Country by the Adriatic Sea.

Accompanying the art troupe to visit and perform in China are the actor Zoiqe Ha Tou, who played Wu Qinghua in the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," the actor Algon Alia Yi, who played the Fourth Sister, and many other familiar comrades. When they just stepped off the plane and saw us, Zoiqe Ha Tou's first words were: "All the actors and worker comrades in our country send their greetings. I have finally realized my dream of coming to China. I feel as if I am dreaming, and I am extremely excited."

When we went to the hotel to visit them, Algon Alia Yi told us excitedly, "We already have the red and shining 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.'" Zoiqe Ha Tou happily said, "On the day we received the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I and another comrade in the same room read it until late at night. Later, we heard that comrades in the next room were also reading it." After studying the Quotations from Chairman Mao, Algon Alia Yi sighed deeply, "I am a professional actor, and in the past, I always wanted to be with those who are technically good, thinking that I could dance better. This time, coming to China to perform with many amateur artists, I think it is very meaningful. We help each other and learn from each other, which can promote the better development of our art." The Albanian comrades' spirit of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and their sincere words from the heart, deeply moved us. We also introduced our experiences of deepening our lives in factories and rural areas according to Chairman Mao's teachings, telling them that we study Chairman Mao's works every day. Zoiqe Ha Tou excitedly expressed that she also wants to read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every day. We talked passionately with each other, sharing our common fighting friendship. Sometimes we discussed the understanding of this quotation, and sometimes we shared the insights of that quotation. Finally, we studied together, "We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." The common revolutionary ideal binds us closely together. We, the cultural workers of the two countries, should use the weapon of art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to serve socialism, and to serve proletarian politics.

When we were having an enthusiastic conversation with our Albanian comrades, we couldn't help but recall the fighting life of rehearsing the Chinese revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" together in Albania. Zoiqe Ha Tou, in order to portray the character of Wu Qinghua, conducted a painstaking study of the role. She told us, "I like the character of Wu Qinghua very much. I was an orphan in the past, my mother died in prison, and my brother escaped from prison at the age of fourteen and joined the guerrilla forces. I was only seven years old when I was liberated from prison. After liberation, the party raised me, enabling me to learn some professional skills. Everything I have is given to me by the party. In the past, I performed ballets of princesses and ladies, and I found it difficult to understand them. Now, performing revolutionary ballets, I can find the basis for creating these heroic characters because they live around us." Therefore, Zoiqe Ha Tou successfully portrayed the character of Wu Qinghua, leaving a very deep impression on the audience.

The Albanian friends have made great efforts to better perform the Chinese revolutionary ballet. The actresses who played the roles in "The Red Detachment of Women" practiced military stabbing movements over and over again and also asked the army comrades for guidance and help. The workers who made costumes for the ballet enthusiastically told us, "For the first Chinese revolutionary ballet to be performed in Albania, we are willing to do everything best for you." The Chinese revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" finally premiered on July 16 last year on the Albanian stage. This is the crystallization of the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries, a victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

Zoiqe Ha Tou and Algon Alia Yi also excitedly told us the best news: the most beloved leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, watched their performance of "The Red Detachment of Women" and gave it a very high evaluation. We were very happy and greatly encouraged to hear this.

During our days in Albania, we learned a lot from the Albanian comrades. Our shared fighting life has forged a deep friendship. Those pure and simple faces, those scenes full of joy and friendship, are so unforgettable! The comrade who played Hong Changqing, Jiemi Er Ximidiwu, did not come to China, but he brought us a letter full of revolutionary friendship. The letter said: "You are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a great event in the world revolution. You are now fighting on the front line of the struggle. The Chinese Khrushchev has been overthrown! Let the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists tremble! We are very concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. ..."

The heroic messengers from Albania—the amateur art troupe "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun"—came to our country for a friendly visit and performance. They not only brought us artistic programs full of revolutionary and fighting spirit but also enhanced the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries. What makes us especially happy is that Zoiqe Ha Tou and Algon Alia Yi will perform "The Red Detachment of Women" with us on the same stage, which is a further development of the friendship between the cultural workers of the two countries. Let us always be united, fight together, and win together, holding high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism, and advance shoulder to shoulder in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism!

The fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania will last forever!

    我们的心是连在一起的
    ——欢迎阿尔巴尼亚的亲密战友
　　工农兵芭蕾舞剧团　蒋祖慧　张策
    在我们欢庆伟大的国庆十八周年的节日里，当我国无产阶级文化大革命取得进一步胜利的时候，阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团来我国访问演出，使我们感到无比的兴奋和喜悦。我们曾经访问过英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，这次能和许多熟悉的战友相会，感到格外的高兴。我们以最最热烈的心情欢迎来自亚得里亚海边山鹰之国的亲密的战友。
    随艺术团来华访问演出的，有在革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》中扮演吴清华的演员佐依察·哈婥同志，扮演老四的演员阿哥隆·阿利阿伊以及其他许多熟识的同志。当他们刚刚走下飞机，见到我们的时候，佐依察·哈婥同志第一句话就说：“我们那里的全体演员、工人同志们向你们问好。我终于实现了自己的理想，来到了中国。我真好象作梦一样，激动极了。”
    当我们去饭店看望他们的时候，阿哥隆·阿利阿伊同志非常激动、兴奋地告诉我们，他们已经有了红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。佐依察·哈婥同志高兴地说：“接到《毛主席语录》那天，我和同屋的另一个同志，一直读到深夜。后来听到隔壁房间的同志也在读。”阿哥隆·阿利阿伊同志学习了毛主席语录之后非常感慨地说：“我是个专业演员，过去我总想和技术好的在一起，认为可以跳得好一些。这次来中国演出和许多业余艺术工作者在一起，我认为很有意义，我们相互帮助，相互学习，这能推动我们的艺术更好地发展。”阿尔巴尼亚同志这种活学活用毛主席著作的革命精神，发自肺腑的真挚话语，深深地感动了我们。我们也介绍了我们按照毛主席的教导在工厂、农村深入生活的体会，告诉他们说我们天天都学毛主席著作。佐依察·哈婥同志激动地表示，她也要天天读《毛主席语录》。我们彼此热烈地交谈，畅叙我们共同战斗的友谊。一会儿谈学习这条语录的体会，一会儿又谈学习那条语录的心得。最后，我们又共同学习了“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”共同的革命理想，把我们紧紧地团结在一起，我们中阿两国的文艺工作者，就是要用文艺武器为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务，为无产阶级政治服务。
    当我们和阿尔巴尼亚战友们热烈交谈的时刻，我们不禁回想起在阿尔巴尼亚一起排练中国革命的芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的战斗生活。佐依察·哈婥同志为了刻划吴清华这个形象，对角色进行了刻苦钻研。她和我们讲：“我很喜欢吴清华这个角色。我以前是一个孤儿，母亲死在监狱里，哥哥十四岁从监狱逃跑出来，参加了游击队。我七岁的时候，才从监狱里解放出来。解放后，党把我培养长大，使我学到了一定的专业技能，我的一切都是党给予我的。过去我演的芭蕾舞都是公主、小姐，我很难体会他们。现在演革命的芭蕾舞，我能找到创造这些英雄人物的依据，因为他们就生活在我们的周围。”正因为如此，佐依察·哈婥同志非常成功地表演了吴清华这个人物，给观众留下了极其深刻的印象。
      阿尔巴尼亚朋友为了能更好地演出中国的革命芭蕾舞剧，付出了巨大的劳动。扮演娘子军的女演员同志们，一遍又一遍地练习军事刺杀动作，并且请部队同志指导帮助。为舞剧做服装的工人同志曾非常热情地对我们说：“为了中国的第一个革命芭蕾舞剧能在阿尔巴尼亚上演，我们愿意为你们做一切一切最美好的东西。”中国的革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》终于在去年七月十六日，在阿尔巴尼亚舞台上演出了。这是中阿两国人民战斗友谊的结晶，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的胜利！
    佐依察·哈婥和阿哥隆·阿利阿伊同志，还非常兴奋地告诉我们一个最好的消息：阿尔巴尼亚人民最敬爱的领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友——恩维尔·霍查同志，观看了他们演出的《红色娘子军》，并对演出给予了很高的评价。我们听了非常高兴，受到了很大的鼓舞。
    在阿尔巴尼亚的日子里，我们向阿尔巴尼亚同志学习了很多东西。共同的战斗生活，使我们结成了深厚的友谊。那一张张纯朴的笑脸，那充满了欢乐友谊的情景，是多么的令人难忘啊！那次扮演洪常青的杰米尔·西米季乌同志，虽然没有到中国来，但是，却给我们带来了充满革命情谊的书信。信中说：“你们正进行着史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，这是世界革命的大事，你们现在是战斗在斗争的最前线。中国的赫鲁晓夫被打倒了！让美帝国主义和苏修发抖吧！对于中国的无产阶级文化大革命，我们是非常关心的。……”
    阿尔巴尼亚的英雄使者——“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团来到我们的国家进行友好访问演出，不仅给我们带来了充满革命性、战斗性的艺术节目，而且增进了中阿两国人民的战斗友谊。特别值得我们高兴的是，佐依察·哈婥同志，和阿哥隆·阿利阿伊同志将和我们同台演出《红色娘子军》，这是我们中阿两国文艺工作者友谊的进一步发展。让我们永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，高举马克思列宁主义革命大旗，在反帝反修的斗争中并肩前进吧！
    中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万古长青！（附图片）
