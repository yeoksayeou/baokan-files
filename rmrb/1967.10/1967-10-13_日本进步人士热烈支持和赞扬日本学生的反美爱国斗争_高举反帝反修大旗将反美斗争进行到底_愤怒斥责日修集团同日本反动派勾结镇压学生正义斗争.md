Japanese progressive figures and revolutionary youth on October 8th unanimously expressed their support for the unprecedentedly intense anti-American patriotic struggle launched by Japanese students that day. They strongly protested against the Sato government's dispatch of armed police to suppress the students' just struggle.

Chairman Koyama Yuichi of the Japanese Journalists' Union said that Sato Eisaku, who had gone to South Vietnam and other places to serve the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam, had dispatched armed police to suppress the students' patriotic just struggle, killing the patriotic student Yamazaki Hiroshi. This incident shows that Sato Eisaku is thoroughly following the U.S. imperialists, hostile to the people of China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, and is working to revive militarism, driving the Japanese people onto the road of aggressive war.

He said that the Sato government's dispatch of a large number of armed police to suppress the people shows that its reactionary rule has reached an intolerable level.

Koyama, representing the revolutionary journalists of Japan, expressed condolences for the heroic martyr Yamazaki Hiroshi. He said, "We will inherit Yamazaki's will, unite with the broad masses of the people, and resolutely fight against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to thoroughly overthrow the rule of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and make Japan truly independent."

Sakae Motomatsu, Chairman of the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, said that Yamazaki Hiroshi was a national hero who stood at the forefront of the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Sato government's policy of aggression, fearlessly fighting and sacrificing himself.

After denouncing the Sato government's fascist atrocities, he pointed out that the Japanese people must follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, be determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and raise the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism to fight to the end to defeat the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, recover Okinawa, and achieve Japan's complete independence.

Nishikawa Keibun, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Religious Persons' Conference, warmly praised Yamazaki Hiroshi's heroic struggle. He pointed out that Yamazaki's heroic sacrifice will inspire the Japanese people to fight more resolutely.

Miyazaki Seiken, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), said that the Japanese students' action at Haneda Airport to protest Sato's "visit" to South Vietnam was a completely just patriotic action. The name of Yamazaki, who died heroically in the police's violent suppression, will be recorded in history alongside that of Kure Hayashi, who died heroically in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in 1960.

Miyazaki pointed out that Sato's violent suppression of the people will inevitably provoke even stronger resistance from the people. He said, "We will, together with the broad masses of the people, raise the banner of the just patriotic struggle and continue the struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries until the final victory."

Hagiwara Saiji, Executive Director of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, said, "We will, together with the broad masses of the people, pursue Sato's serious crime of murdering Yamazaki Hiroshi and demand that the Sato cabinet resign immediately."

A young person engaged in Japan-China friendly trade, Takagi, said, "We cannot tolerate Sato Eisaku's anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people stance. We must resolutely fight to overthrow the Sato cabinet." He said, "We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Be brave, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and advance fearlessly.'"

Female worker Morikawa Yoko expressed, "We must learn from the students' heroic struggle, advance on the bloodstained path of the martyrs, and fight to the end against the Japanese reactionaries and the revisionist group led by Miyamoto."

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement strongly protesting the Sato government's dispatch of a large number of armed police to brutally suppress the students' just patriotic struggle. The statement pointed out that the Sato cabinet, which is helping the U.S. imperialists wage an aggressive war, is fully responsible for this serious incident. The Japan Socialist Party demands the resignation of the Sato cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, October 9th: According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) issued a statement on the 9th, firmly supporting the heroic anti-American patriotic struggle launched by Japanese patriotic students on the 8th at Haneda Airport. The statement highly praised the patriotic youth Yamazaki Hiroshi, who died heroically in the struggle, and decided to hold a memorial meeting for the martyr Yamazaki in conjunction with various progressive organizations.

The statement pointed out that the martyr Yamazaki, to prevent Sato Eisaku from going to South Vietnam to serve the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, fought heroically and shed his last drop of blood. We will bury the martyr Yamazaki's body properly, inherit his patriotic and internationalist will, and resolutely fight against the traitorous Sato government that implements an aggressive policy.

The statement said that what is particularly intolerable is that the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist group maliciously slandered the Japanese youth students' anti-American patriotic struggle. They said that Yamazaki's death was "incited by counter-revolutionary Trotskyites and self-inflicted," which is a great insult to the thousands of patriotic people.

The statement exposed that while the patriotic youth were heroically fighting against the Japanese reactionaries at Haneda Airport, the Miyamoto revisionist group chose this very day to go to the suburbs of Tokyo to hold a meeting for election propaganda activities, fully exposing their ugly faces of doing counter-revolutionary deeds under the banner of revolution.

The statement concluded by saying, "We swear: To achieve Japan's independence, peace, and democracy, we must unite all the people of the nation who are dedicated to Japan-China friendship, strengthen the anti-American patriotic united front, and fight to the end to thoroughly defeat the common enemy of the people of China and Japan."

　　日本进步人士热烈支持和赞扬日本学生的反美爱国斗争
　　高举反帝反修大旗将反美斗争进行到底
　　愤怒斥责日修集团同日本反动派勾结镇压学生正义斗争
    新华社八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本各界进步人士和革命青年八日纷纷发表谈话，坚决支持日本学生八日开展的空前激烈的反美爱国斗争，强烈抗议佐藤政府出动武装警察镇压学生的法西斯罪行。
    日本记者同盟主席小林雄一说，佐藤荣作为了前往南越等地为美帝国主义侵越战争奔走效劳，出动了武装警察镇压学生的爱国正义斗争，残杀爱国学生山崎博昭。这一事件说明佐藤荣作要彻头彻尾地追随美帝国主义，敌视中国、越南和亚洲各国人民，加紧复活军国主义，驱使日本人民走上侵略战争的道路。
    他说，佐藤政府出动大批武装警察镇压人民，说明了它的反动统治达到了无法容忍的地步。
    小林代表日本革命的新闻工作者对英勇牺牲的爱国学生山崎博昭表示哀悼。他说，我们将继承山崎的遗志，团结广大的人民群众同美日反动派进行坚决的斗争，彻底推翻美日反动派的统治，使日本获得真正的独立。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松说，山崎博昭是站在日本广大人民反对美帝国主义和佐藤政府推行侵略政策的最前线进行英勇斗争，不怕牺牲的民族英雄。
    他在谴责佐藤政府的法西斯暴行后指出，日本人民必须遵循毛主席的教导，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，高举反帝反修的旗帜，为打败美帝在越南进行的侵略战争、收复冲绳、实现日本的完全独立而斗争到底。
    日中友好宗教者恳谈会会长西川景文热烈颂扬山崎博昭英勇斗争的精神。他指出，山崎的英勇牺牲将激起日本人民群众更坚决的斗争。
    日中友好协会（正统）理事长宫崎世民说，日本学生在羽田机场抗议佐藤“访问”南越的行动完全是爱国的正义行动。在警察的暴力镇压中壮烈牺牲的山崎的名字将同一九六○年在反对美日“安全保障条约”斗争中英勇牺牲的桦美智子一样，载入史册。
    宫崎指出，佐藤镇压人民的暴行必将引起人民更加强烈的反抗。他说，我们将同广大的人民一道高举爱国正义斗争的旗帜，继续进行反对美日反动派的斗争，直到最后胜利。
    日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事萩原定司说，我们将同广大的人民群众一起追究佐藤屠杀山崎博昭的严重罪行，要求佐藤内阁立即辞职。
    从事日中友好贸易工作的青年高木说，我们决不能容忍佐藤荣作反华、反共、反人民，我们必须为打倒佐藤内阁而进行坚决的斗争。他说，我们要牢记毛主席的“要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继”的教导。
    女工森川洋子表示，要学习学生们英勇斗争的精神，踏着牺牲者的血迹前进，同日本反动派和宫本修正主义集团斗争到底。
    日本社会党发表声明，强烈抗议佐藤政府出动大批武装警察血腥镇压学生的爱国正义斗争。声明指出，加紧帮助美帝进行侵略战争的佐藤内阁应对这一严重事件负全部责任，日本社会党要求佐藤内阁辞职。
    新华社九日讯　东方通讯社报道：日中友好协会（正统）总部九日发表声明，坚决支持日本爱国学生八日在羽田机场进行的英勇的反美爱国斗争，高度评价在斗争中壮烈牺牲的爱国青年山崎博昭，并且决定同各进步团体联合为山崎烈士举行追悼大会。
    声明指出，山崎烈士为了阻止佐藤荣作去南越为美帝侵略战争效劳，进行了英勇的斗争，流尽了最后一滴血。我们将掩埋好山崎烈士的尸体，继承他的爱国主义、国际主义的遗志，向执行侵略政策的佐藤卖国政府进行坚决的斗争。
    声明说，令人特别不能容忍的是，日共宫本修正主义集团竟然恶毒谩骂日本青年学生的反美爱国斗争，他们胡说什么山崎的死是“受反革命托洛茨基分子的挑拨，自作自受”，这是宫本修正主义集团对于数千爱国人士的极大的侮辱。
    声明揭露说，正当爱国青年在羽田机场向日本反动派英勇斗争的时候，宫本修正主义集团恰恰选择这个日子，跑到东京郊区开大会进行竞选的宣传活动，这就充分暴露了他们打着革命的旗子干着反革命勾当的丑恶嘴脸。
    声明最后说，我们宣誓：为了实现日本的独立、和平和民主，要团结有志于日中友好的全国人民，加强反美爱国统一战线，为彻底战胜日中两国人民的共同敌人而斗争到底。
