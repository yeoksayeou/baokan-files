Editor's Note: The "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing" has given us an important combat mission: to wage a struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists in the realm of literature and art.

Revisionist literature is a variant of bourgeois literature. It wears a sheep's head but sells dog meat, donning the cloak of socialism to peddle bourgeois goods. The historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship tells us: revisionist literature is the hemlock used by the bourgeoisie and their agents to poison the working people, a tool for the restoration of capitalism. It is the mouthpiece of the modern revisionist political line.

To defend Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to expose the reactionary nature of revisionist literature, and to eliminate the influence and poison of revisionist literature, in this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fight against foreign revisionist literature.

The "Minutes" points out: "In the struggle against foreign revisionism in literature and art, we cannot just catch small fry like Chukhrai. We must catch the big ones, catch Sholokhov, and dare to confront him. He is the ancestor of revisionist literature."

The center of foreign revisionist literature is Soviet revisionist literature. Sholokhov, Simonov, Ehrenburg, Tvardovsky, and the like, especially the ancestor of Soviet revisionist literature, Sholokhov, have caused great harm. Today, as we open fire on revisionist literature, we must first "catch the big ones, catch Sholokhov," and criticize and detoxify the main works of these Soviet revisionist literature leaders.

Currently, the hundreds of millions of people in our country are waging a great criticism aimed at the handful of capitalists within the Party. The criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line is an important part of this great criticism. The heads of the revisionist literary black line in our country, such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, Xia Yan, and their ultimate backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, have many fallacies that are wholesale from Soviet revisionist literature. In the high tide of revolutionary criticism, criticizing Soviet revisionist literature will help us deeply criticize the domestic counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line.

The document "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing," which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, points out: "In the struggle against foreign revisionism in literature and art, we cannot just catch small fry like Chukhrai. We must catch the big ones, catch Sholokhov, and dare to confront him. He is the ancestor of revisionist literature." This is the order to launch a general offensive against the international revisionist literary current, and it is a call to arms for the proletarian revolutionaries across the country!

For forty years, the bourgeoisie and revisionists of the Soviet Union and other countries have all hyped Sholokhov as a "great writer." Khrushchev praised him as an "excellent example," saying that he actively participated in and used his works to "narrate the most important and decisive stages of the history of Soviet society." The Chinese Khrushchev also worshipped this "foreign writer" as a god.

What is this Sholokhov? We only need to look at his history, expose his past, and see what role he played in each major historical turning point of the class struggle in the Soviet Union, and we can strip off his cloak of a "proletarian revolutionary writer" and reveal his counter-revolutionary true colors.

The Enemy of the Proletarian Dictatorship

After the victory of the October Revolution, the Party and people of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the great Lenin, shouldered the historical task of defending and consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. The representatives of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated the Party, such as Trotsky and Zinoviev, denied the path of the October Revolution and tried every means to overthrow the newly born Soviet power and restore capitalism. After Lenin's death, the Bolshevik Party led by Stalin resolutely defended the path of the October Revolution, smashed the frenzied attacks of the anti-Party clique, and consolidated the proletarian dictatorship. At this critical moment, Sholokhov stood on the side of the anti-Party clique and first raised the black flag of revisionism on the literary front, attacking the proletarian violent revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and creating public opinion for the Trotsky-Zinoviev counter-revolutionary revisionist clique to seize the Party.

In 1926, he published his first collection of short stories, "The Don Stories," in which "The Road," depicting a young food procurement team member who betrayed and surrendered to the Makhno bandits after being captured, is a self-portrait of the author's ugly traitorous face. This Sholokhov, who claimed to be "born of the revolution and fought for the victory of the Soviets in the years of the civil war," was captured by the Makhno bandits when he was a food procurement team member in 1921. Forty years later, when he recalled the scene of being captured at that time, he still trembled with fear and confessed: "I was too harsh on the kulaks," "but then they came and released me... I really wanted to live!" This is the image of a shameless traitor! From this time on, Sholokhov took the path of betraying the October Revolution.

From 1926 to 1939, Sholokhov spent nearly fourteen years meticulously creating the poisonous weed "And Quiet Flows the Don." In this novel of one and a half million words, the armed seizure of power in the October Revolution and the armed defense of the proletarian dictatorship in the civil war are maliciously depicted as a "great tragedy" that destroyed the "peaceful and prosperous life" of the Don Cossacks, a "more painful and disastrous" event than imperialist wars. The novel praises a blood-stained counter-revolutionary, Grigory, and the wealthy Cossack class he represents, maliciously attacking the Soviet government established by the October Revolution as "a new and worse system," cursing "this government brought only destruction to us Cossacks," and thus denying the glorious path of the October Revolution to establish the proletarian dictatorship through violent revolution. After the October Revolution, Lenin once pointed out: Who curses the first Soviet created by the Russian working class? It is "all the bourgeois scoundrels, all the blood-sucking bandits, and their singers, Kautsky." Sholokhov is precisely one of these bourgeois scoundrels and bandits who were overthrown by the October Revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "We do not practice benevolence towards the reactionaries and reactionary classes," "There is no question of stimulating or not stimulating them." However, in a 1931 letter to Gorky, Sholokhov blatantly claimed that the cause of the Cossack rebellion during the civil war was due to the so-called "excesses" of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, maliciously shouting: "It is necessary to portray the policy errors of settling accounts with the Cossacks and harming the middle peasants, because without portraying this aspect, the cause of the rebellion cannot be revealed. Without reason, not only will there be no rebellion, but even fleas will not bite people." In "And Quiet Flows the Don," he also spared no effort to defend the Cossack counter-revolutionary rebellion. He himself admitted: "I described the struggle between the Whites and the Reds, not the struggle between the Reds and the Whites." He dressed up Grigory, this counter-revolutionary rebel, as an "indecisive middle figure" who was disgusted with both revolution and counter-revolution, trying to make people "trust" the so-called "sincere words" of this enemy of the Soviet government: "If the Soviet government does not oppress me, I will not oppose the Soviet government." Sholokhov so blatantly advocated the "justification of rebellion," demanding that the Soviet government abandon its right to suppress class enemies, is this not creating public opinion for the counter-revolutionary restoration to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship?

After "And Quiet Flows the Don" was published, the broad revolutionary masses of the Soviet Union severely criticized this poisonous weed, sharply pointing out that the novel was "defending the Cossack White Guard rebellion," a work "hating the proletariat and going against the proletariat," the author was not a "proletarian writer" at all, but a "representative of the Cossack kulaks and foreign nobles." The bourgeoisie and revisionists, however, were ecstatic about the "birth of a classic work of Soviet literature" they idealized. The fierce debate surrounding "And Quiet Flows the Don" was essentially a reflection of the sharp struggle between restoration and anti-restoration centered on the power issue in the field of Soviet literature.

Eighteen years after the publication of "And Quiet Flows the Don," in 1956, when the counter-revolutionary rebellion broke out in Hungary, Sholokhov, from his reactionary position, could not help but jump out again, cheering and defending the ghosts and snakes of the Petofi Club, saying they were like Grigory, "accidentally and blindly participating in the White Guard movement" and "indecisive" figures. This fully proves that the Grigory of the 1920s was the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebel of the 1950s. "And Quiet Flows the Don" is a reactionary novel that summons and erects monuments for such counter-revolutionary rebels. Sholokhov is the ancestor of revisionist literature who uses literature to engage in counter-revolutionary activities under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship.

A Loyal Disciple of Bukharin

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Soviet Union entered the period of agricultural collectivization. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without the socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete and consolidated socialism." Realizing agricultural collectivization is a great struggle between socialism and capitalism in the countryside, a profound and extensive socialist revolution. The right-opportunist representatives led by Bukharin strongly opposed agricultural collectivization and the elimination of the kulaks. The Central Committee of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) led by Stalin waged an irreconcilable struggle with these bourgeois representatives within the Party, defending and adhering to Lenin's line of agricultural collectivization.

In this sharp class struggle, Sholokhov acted as the spokesman for the Bukharin right-opportunist clique on the literary front. In the novel "Virgin Soil Upturned" (Part One), which he began writing in 1930, he raised the banner of "anti-leftism," praising the right-opportunist line, and denying the Soviet agricultural collectivization movement. Stalin pointed out that in the agricultural collectivization movement, "the right deviation is past and present is our main danger," while opposing "leftist" errors is "the condition and special form of victory over right opportunism." However, Sholokhov, in the novel, spared no effort to exaggerate the so-called "excesses" of the collectivization period, portraying "leftist" errors as the main danger, and depicting a magnificent collectivization movement as a completely "forced" and "erroneous" behavior without mass support. He openly portrayed Davydov, the chairman of the collective farm who actually implemented a right-opportunist line that excluded poor peasants, relied on wealthy middle peasants, and protected kulaks, as a representative of the "correct line." The novel also tried to beautify the kulaks, portraying a hidden kulak counter-revolutionary as a "scientifically managed," "thoughtful," "hardworking," and "truly devoted to farm management" good manager. Although Sholokhov made clever disguises in the novel and paid some insincere praise to Stalin, he was actually standing on the reactionary position of the right-opportunists, attacking the correct line of eliminating kulaks and complete collectivization, praising Bukharin's opportunist line, and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism.

Sholokhov himself was a thorough right-opportunist. As early as 1929, when the collectivization movement began on a large scale, someone exposed his crimes of protecting kulaks in the Vishenskaya district in the newspapers. By 1933, in a letter to Stalin and the secretary of the Vishenskaya district party committee, he still fiercely attacked the collectivization movement, pleading for the kulaks who had been eliminated, and trying to rehabilitate the right-opportunists, saying that "outstanding figures are considered enemies of the Party," "the problem is very serious," and maliciously shouting: "We must struggle against all brutality and inhumanity." Under the pretext of opposing the "violent behavior" in the grain procurement work, he fiercely attacked the socialist system and the Party's leadership, slandering the collective farms under Stalin's leadership as even "darker" than the villages under the tsarist rule, claiming to "pursue the culprits," his intentions were extremely malicious! Stalin criticized him severely at that time. Sholokhov was so hostile to the socialist collective farms, while he yearned for capitalist agriculture. In 1935, after visiting Denmark, Sweden, England, France, and other countries, he boasted about the "beneficial and valuable achievements" of "advanced capitalist agriculture," and shamelessly said that one should "learn from" those capitalist countries. All this fully shows that Sholokhov is a trumpeter for the restoration of capitalism, a loyal disciple of Bukharin.

A Traitor to the People's Revolutionary War

In the 1940s, the Soviet people, under the leadership of Stalin, engaged in a great struggle with German fascism that determined the future of socialism and humanity. In this severe test, Sholokhov blatantly exposed his ugly face of opposing the people's war. In his political essays and novels written during the war years, he did not sing the praises of the revolutionary heroism of the Soviet military and people, but spread despair and pessimism. The war had only been fought for two years when he issued a cry of despair in the letter "To American Friends," lamenting: "Our country, our people have been ravaged by the war, leaving us battered and bruised," and humbly begged the United States to send troops, placing all his hopes on American imperialism.

After the Second World War, the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America surged. At this time, he jumped out again with Khrushchev, fiercely opposing the people's war. He was frightened by the American nuclear blackmail, crying out that the "shadow of the hydrogen bomb" was "destroying the sunshine of life's joy," saying that the main goal of humanity today was to "struggle for peace," completely canceling the fundamental task of carrying the proletarian world revolution to the end. Chairman Mao taught us: "All just revolutionary wars have great power; they can transform many things or pave the way for transformation," "The whole world can only be transformed by the gun." However, Sholokhov shouted everywhere to "say no to war," claiming that "no war will create anything. War is a destroyer." To "survive," he colluded with imperialism and reactionaries of various countries, shouting to "unite" against the people's revolutionary wars.

The poisonous weed "One Man's Fate," hastily thrown out after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, is evidence of his opposition to the people's revolutionary war. In the novel, through the traitor Sokolov's so-called "tragic experience" in the Patriotic War, he exaggerated the "suffering" and "terror" of the war, singing praises for the traitors who surrendered to the enemy, and maliciously cursing the great anti-fascist war as "burying" the "last joy and hope" of the Soviet people. Today, when the people's wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, the author's propaganda of pacifism and surrenderism, and the Soviet revisionist clique's making it into a film to spread poison throughout the world, is a great betrayal of the world revolution! As a product of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the novel also artistically embodied the "peaceful coexistence" general line of the Soviet revisionist clique in this respect, so the Soviet revisionist literary circle praised it as "laying the foundation for the beginning of a new direction in modern literature." Khrushchev also praised it as an "excellent short novel." After the novel was published, a batch of poisonous weeds like "An Inch of Land," "The Soldier's Song," and "The Living and the Dead," which fiercely attacked Stalin and maliciously cursed the revolutionary war, emerged one after another. The black wind of the Soviet revisionist literary counter-revolutionary war was blown up by Sholokhov.

A Vanguard of the Restoration of Capitalism

After Stalin's death, socialist Soviet Union faced another great struggle between two destinies and two futures. At this critical historical juncture, Sholokhov completely tore off his mask and further revealed his counter-revolutionary true colors.

Chairman Mao taught us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work." Sholokhov was the vanguard in creating public opinion for Khrushchev's seizure of the Party. In the second year after Stalin's death, he took the lead in stirring up trouble at the second congress of the Soviet Writers' Union, completely denying the achievements of revolutionary literature in the Stalin era, shouting loudly to urge writers to "take out the rusty bullets from the ammunition box and replace them with newer ones," to solve the so-called "problems that have made people anxious for twenty years," directly pointing the spearhead at Stalin, whom he once called his "dear lifelong beloved father." At the 20th Congress of the CPSU, he even took off his shirt, openly calling for the dismissal of the Party's literary leaders during the Stalin era.

On the one hand, Sholokhov fiercely attacked Stalin, on the other hand, he frantically cheered for Khrushchev's revisionist line, passionately singing praises for the restoration of capitalism. He praised the thoroughly revisionist "Program of the CPSU" to the skies, saying it was a "fresh and pleasant breeze," "a shining light for humanity," and an "indestructible monument." He highly praised Khrushchev's series of revisionist policies in the economy, such as welfareism and material incentives, claiming that all this would "present a beautiful prospect" for the workers of state farms and collective farms. He even shamelessly praised the great retreat and disaster caused by Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism in industry and agriculture as "unprecedented achievements," and flatteringly praised Khrushchev's reactionary rule as a "beautiful era full of daring and creative spirit."

Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, to "keep in step" with Khrushchev, Sholokhov hastily created the poisonous weed "Virgin Soil Upturned" (Part Two), using historical themes to "cleverly" and "closely" serve the Soviet revisionist clique's actual revisionist political line, advocating the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. In this novel, the guiding ideology of the party organization leaders of the collective farms was Khrushchev's incessant "everything for the people, everything for the happiness of the people," "people and people are friends, comrades, and brothers." These leaders did not criticize or struggle against the spontaneous capitalist forces among the farm members, but indulged and tolerated them, allowing them to spread; they either lost vigilance or indulged and protected the hidden reactionary officers and reactionary kulaks who crazily destroyed the collective economy. This "collective farm" that does not want proletarian dictatorship and socialism has been completely capitalist.

Sholokhov also used the special position given to him by the Soviet revisionist clique to systematically promote Khrushchev's revisionist literary black line in the literary circle.

He fiercely opposed Lenin's literary party spirit principle and Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively advocating "national literature." To cover up the class nature of Soviet revisionist literature serving a handful of new and old bourgeoisie, he portrayed literature as a "matter of conscience," claiming that everything artists do is "for the people, for humanity."

He fiercely opposed the ideological reform of writers, attempting to replace the combination of writers with workers, peasants, and soldiers with Khrushchev's peddling of "maintaining close contact with the life of the people," thereby maintaining the privileged position of Soviet revisionist writers. Sholokhov himself was "maintaining close contact with the life of the people" while living in a villa. He openly declared: "For me, there is no question of 'going to the countryside,'" this "takes a lot of time and affects creation."

He fiercely opposed the criticism of bourgeois literature, vigorously supporting the new and old ghosts and snakes in the literary circle. The great traitor Pasternak was in his eyes a "talented poet," and a group of young reactionary writers who called themselves "children of the 20th Congress of the CPSU," he regarded as "true wealth," vigorously advocating their entry into the leadership of the Writers' Union, fearing that Soviet revisionist literature would die out.

He consistently opposed the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in creation, opposed the portrayal of workers, peasants, and soldiers as heroes in literature, and passionately advocated a set of revisionist literary theories aimed at distorting socialism and the proletarian dictatorship, such as "writing reality" and "writing wavering characters."

Soviet revisionist critics boasted that "today, the general line of Soviet literature, its people's nature, its content and form, are all connected with the name of Sholokhov." This is truly a self-incriminating statement!

For more than a decade, Sholokhov has served the political line of the Soviet revisionist leadership to restore capitalism with all his heart and soul. The Soviet revisionist leadership also particularly favored him. In 1959, Khrushchev personally visited him, establishing him as a "shining example" of Soviet writers, granting him the status of "full representative of the Soviet cultural circle." Subsequently, he was awarded one medal after another, such as "Secretary of the All-Union Writers' Union," "Deputy of the Supreme Soviet," and "Member of the Central Committee of the CPSU." After the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique came to power, they also awarded Sholokhov the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor." In fact, he had become the biggest representative of the bourgeoisie in the Soviet literary circle, the number one representative of the Soviet privileged class in the literary circle.

A Loyal Slave of Imperialism

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The existence of bourgeois influence is the domestic root of revisionism. Yielding to the pressure of imperialism is the foreign root of revisionism." Within the country, Sholokhov actively advocated the restoration of capitalism, and abroad, he served Khrushchev's "peaceful coexistence" general line with the soul of "Soviet-American cooperation." According to incomplete statistics, since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Sholokhov, as the "full representative of the Soviet cultural circle" appointed by Khrushchev, has visited capitalist countries more than twenty or thirty times to collude.

In July 1955, after the Geneva Summit of the Four Powers ended, Sholokhov hurriedly wrote to the editorial department of "Foreign Literature" in August, proposing to convene a "round table conference" of world writers, passionately advocating the so-called "Geneva spirit" to be "implemented in all aspects of international life." He was particularly fond of "Soviet-American cultural exchange."

In 1959, he accompanied Khrushchev to the United States and held talks with Eisenhower at Camp David. This meeting opened the evil history of Soviet-American collusion against the world revolution, but Sholokhov created the atmosphere and public opinion for it. Before the talks, he shouted: "Let's visit each other! We have nothing to argue or fight about," advocating "mutual publication of books, holding exhibitions, and mutual understanding of our peoples, isn't it better than firing anti-aircraft guns?" After the talks ended, he enthusiastically praised Khrushchev's great betrayal as "great, fantastic!"

In 1963, the Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with the United States and Britain, signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in Moscow, openly forming a counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" with the imperialists led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries. On the day the treaty was signed, Sholokhov hurriedly peddled the "Moscow spirit" at the European Writers' Conference, shouting loudly that writers should find a "common language" and "reach an agreement" like the "important politicians and diplomats" of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and form a "holy alliance" of imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary writers.

From the "Geneva spirit" to the "Moscow spirit," Sholokhov and Khrushchev, master and servant, sang in unison, walking a more and more despicable path of betrayal, becoming a loyal slave of imperialism.

"Heaven does not disappoint the diligent." The "efforts" of the slave indeed received the appropriate "reward" from the master. In 1965, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which specially "reserved" the Nobel Prize for Western writers and Eastern traitors, awarded it to him. And his traitorous face was thus even more exposed!

History is the best witness. At every major historical turning point of the class struggle in the Soviet Union, Sholokhov played the shameful role of betraying the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. He once pretended to say: "Betrayal is always the most despicable, filthiest, and most despised thing." But this is precisely the "business" he has been engaged in all his life, and its despicability, filthiness, and shamelessness cannot be washed away even by the waters of the Don River!

The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in our country has greatly inspired and promoted the revolutionary struggles of the revolutionary people of the whole world. The Soviet people with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution will surely rise up one day to create a counter-revolution against the Soviet revisionist leadership. Today, we expose Sholokhov to the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought; tomorrow, Sholokhov will not escape the severe judgment of the Soviet revolutionary people! The Soviet people will surely bury him along with Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like!

    揭穿肖洛霍夫的反革命真面目
    师红游
    编者按：《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》中，向我们提出了一项重要的战斗任务：在文艺上进行反对以苏修为中心的现代修正主义的斗争。
    修正主义文艺是资产阶级文艺的变种。它挂羊头，卖狗肉，披着社会主义的外衣，贩卖资产阶级的货色。国际无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们：修正主义文艺是资产阶级及其代理人毒害劳动人民的砒霜，复辟资本主义的工具。它是现代修正主义政治路线的传声筒。
    为了捍卫马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，为了揭露修正主义文艺的反动本质，为了肃清修正主义文艺的影响和流毒，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们应当高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，对外国修正主义文艺进行坚决的斗争。
    《纪要》指出：“文艺上反对外国修正主义的斗争，不能只捉丘赫拉依之类小人物。要捉大的，捉肖洛霍夫，要敢于碰他。他是修正主义文艺的鼻祖。”
    外国修正主义文艺的中心是苏修文艺。肖洛霍夫、西蒙诺夫、爱伦堡、特瓦尔多夫斯基之流，特别是苏修文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫的一些作品，流毒很大。今天，我们向修正主义文艺开火，首先就“要捉大的，捉肖洛霍夫”，对这些苏修文艺头头的主要作品进行批判和消毒。
    当前，我国亿万群众正在进行着一场矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判。对反革命修正主义文艺黑线的批判，是这个革命大批判的一个重要组成部分。我国修正主义文艺黑线的头头陆定一、周扬、林默涵、夏衍之流及其总后台中国赫鲁晓夫的许多谬论，都是从苏修文艺那里批发来的。在革命大批判的高潮中，批判苏修文艺，有助于我们深入地批判国内的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。
    《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》这个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的马列主义文件指出：“文艺上反对外国修正主义的斗争，不能只捉丘赫拉依之类小人物。要捉大的，捉肖洛霍夫，要敢于碰他。他是修正主义文艺的鼻祖。”这是向国际上修正主义文艺逆流发动总攻击的进军令，这是向全国无产阶级革命派发出的战斗号召！
    四十年来，苏联及其他国家的资产阶级和修正主义者，都把肖洛霍夫吹捧成“伟大作家”。赫鲁晓夫夸他是个“顶好的榜样”，说什么他积极参加了并用作品“叙述了苏维埃社会历史中的最重要的、决定性阶段”的斗争。中国的赫鲁晓夫也把这个“洋作家”奉若神明。
    这个肖洛霍夫究竟是什么东西？我们只要翻翻他的历史，抖抖他的老底，看看他在苏联阶级斗争的每个重大历史关头扮演的是什么角色，就可以剥下他“无产阶级革命作家”的外衣，现出他反革命的原形。
      无产阶级专政的死敌
    十月革命胜利后，苏联的党和人民在伟大列宁的领导下，肩负着保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的历史任务。钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物托洛茨基、季诺维也夫之流，否定十月革命的道路，千方百计企图颠覆新生的苏维埃政权，复辟资本主义。列宁逝世后，以斯大林为首的布尔什维克党则坚决捍卫了十月革命的道路，粉碎了反党集团的猖狂进攻，巩固了无产阶级专政。在这个关键时刻，肖洛霍夫站在反党集团一边，在文艺阵地上首先打出背叛十月革命道路的修正主义黑旗，攻击无产阶级的暴力革命和无产阶级专政，为托洛茨基、季诺维也夫反革命修正主义集团篡党篡政大造舆论。
    他在一九二六年抛出了第一个短篇小说集《顿河的故事》，其中《道路》所写的一个被马赫诺匪帮俘虏后变节投敌的“年青的粮食征集队员”，便是作者丑恶的叛徒嘴脸的自我写照。这个自诩为“革命所诞生的，在国内战争年代为苏维埃的胜利而斗争”的肖洛霍夫，在一九二一年当粮食征集队员时，曾被马赫诺匪帮俘虏过。四十年后，当他回忆起当时被俘的情景，还心有余悸地忏悔说：“我对富农太严厉了”，“可是后来他们来把我放了……非常想活啊！”完全是无耻的叛徒形象！从这时起，肖洛霍夫就走上了背叛十月革命的道路。
    肖洛霍夫从一九二六年到一九三九年，用了近十四年的时间，精心炮制了大毒草《静静的顿河》。在这部洋洋一百五十万言的小说中，武装夺取政权的十月革命和武装捍卫无产阶级政权的国内革命战争，被恶毒地描绘成破坏顿河哥萨克的“宁静富足生活”的一场“大悲剧”，是比帝国主义战争“更加厉害的痛苦和灾难”。小说通篇歌颂一个血债累累的反革命分子葛利高里和他所代表的哥萨克富裕阶层，恶毒地攻击十月革命所建立的苏维埃政权是“一种新的更坏的制度”，诅咒“这个政府给我们哥萨克带来的只是破坏”，从而否定通过暴力革命建立无产阶级专政的十月革命的光辉道路。列宁在十月革命以后曾经指出，究竟是什么人咒骂俄国劳动阶级第一次创立的苏维埃呢？是“所有的资产阶级恶棍，所有的喝血的匪帮，以及他们的讴歌者考茨基”。肖洛霍夫正是这伙被十月革命推翻的资产阶级恶棍和匪帮的讴歌者。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政”，“对于这些人，并不发生刺激与否的问题”。而肖洛霍夫在一九三一年给高尔基的一封信中，却公然胡说国内战争时期发生哥萨克叛乱的原因，是由于布尔什维克党和苏维埃政权的所谓“过火行为”，恶毒地叫嚷：“应该表现清算哥萨克和损害哥萨克中农的政策上的错误，因为不表现这一方面，就不能揭示叛乱的原因。无缘无故，不仅不会叛乱，连跳蚤也不会咬人”。他在《静静的顿河》中，也正是这样竭尽全力为哥萨克反革命叛乱辩护的。他自己供认：“我描写的是白军同红军作斗争，而不是红军同白军作斗争。”他把葛利高里这个反革命叛乱分子打扮成“对革命和反革命都讨厌了”的“动摇不定的中间人物”，竭力要人们“信任”这个苏维埃政权的死敌的所谓“真心话”：“如果苏维埃政权不来压迫我，我是不会去反对苏维埃政权的”。肖洛霍夫如此明目张胆地鼓吹反革命的“叛乱有理”，要苏维埃政权放弃对阶级敌人镇压之权，这不是为颠覆无产阶级专政的反革命复辟制造舆论又是什么？
    《静静的顿河》出笼后，苏联广大革命群众对这株大毒草提出了严厉的批评，尖锐地指出小说是“为哥萨克白匪叛乱辩护”，是一部“仇视无产阶级、同无产阶级背道而驰的作品”，作者根本“不是无产阶级作家”，而是“哥萨克富农与外国的贵族的代表人物”。资产阶级和修正主义者则为他们“所理想”的“苏联经典性作品的诞生”而欣喜若狂。围绕着《静静的顿河》展开的激烈争论，实质上是以政权问题为中心的复辟和反复辟的尖锐斗争在苏联文艺领域内的反映。
    《静静的顿河》发表十八年后，在一九五六年匈牙利发生反革命叛乱时，肖洛霍夫从他的反动立场出发，又情不自禁地跳了出来，为裴多菲俱乐部的牛鬼蛇神喝采和辩护，说他们是象葛利高里那样“偶然地、盲目地参加了白卫军运动”的“动摇不定”的人物。这就充分证明了二十年代的葛利高里就是五十年代的匈牙利反革命叛乱分子。《静静的顿河》就是为这类反革命叛乱分子招魂和树碑立传的反动小说。肖洛霍夫就是在无产阶级专政的条件下，利用文艺进行反革命活动的修正主义文艺鼻祖。
        布哈林的忠实门徒
    二十年代末三十年代初，苏联进入了农业集体化时期。毛主席指出：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”实现农业集体化，是农村中社会主义战胜资本主义的一场大决战，是一场极其广泛而深刻的社会主义革命。以布哈林为代表的右倾机会主义分子竭力反对农业集体化，反对消灭富农。以斯大林为首的联共（布）党中央同这些党内资产阶级代表人物，进行了不调和的斗争，捍卫和坚持了列宁的农业集体化路线。
    在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，肖洛霍夫充当了布哈林右倾机会主义集团在文艺战线上的代言人。他在一九三○年开始创作的小说《被开垦的处女地》（第一部），就是一部打着反“左”的旗号，歌颂右倾机会主义路线，否定苏联农业集体化运动的代表作。斯大林指出，在农业集体化运动中，“右倾危险过去是现在仍然是我们的主要危险”，而反对“左”倾错误，乃是“胜利地和右倾机会主义作斗争的条件和特殊形式。”而肖洛霍夫却在小说里，不遗余力地夸大集体化时期的所谓“过火行为”，把“左”倾错误写成主要危险，把一场轰轰烈烈的集体化运动，写成毫无群众基础，完全是“强迫命令”的“错误行为”。他公然把实际上贯彻一条排斥贫农、依靠富裕中农、包庇富农的右倾机会主义路线的集体农庄主席达维多夫，描绘成“正确路线”的代表。小说还竭力美化富农，把一个暗藏的富农反革命分子描绘成“善于科学经营的”“会动脑筋的”“爱干活的”“真心迷恋农庄管理”的“好当家”。尽管肖洛霍夫进行了巧妙的伪装，在小说中对斯大林作了一些言不由衷的颂扬；实际上却完全是站在右倾机会主义分子的反动立场上，攻击消灭富农、全盘集体化的正确路线，歌颂布哈林的机会主义路线，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    肖洛霍夫本人就是一个道道地地的右倾机会主义者。早在一九二九年集体化运动大规模开始时期，就有人在报刊上揭发肖洛霍夫在维申斯卡亚区袒护富农的罪行。到了一九三三年，他在给斯大林和维申斯卡亚区党委书记的信中，仍大肆攻击集体化运动，替被消灭的富农鸣冤叫屈，为右倾机会主义分子翻案，说什么“优秀的人物被认为是党的敌人”，“问题严重极了”，恶毒地叫嚷：“必须同一切残暴和无情行为作斗争”。他借口反对“征粮工作”中发生的“狂暴行为”，猖狂攻击社会主义制度和党的领导，把斯大林领导时期的集体农庄污蔑为比沙皇统治下的农村还要“黑暗”，声言“要追究指挥他们的祸首”，用心何其毒也！斯大林在当时就对他进行了严正的批评。肖洛霍夫对社会主义集体农庄如此仇视，而对资本主义农业却无限向往。一九三五年，他到丹麦、瑞典、英、法等国访问后，就吹嘘“先进的资本主义农业”的“有益的、可贵的成就”，并无耻地说什么应该“向那些”资本主义国家“学习”。这一切都充分说明了肖洛霍夫是复辟资本主义的吹鼓手，是布哈林的忠实门徒。
      人民革命战争的叛徒
    四十年代，苏联人民在斯大林的领导下，和德国法西斯进行了关系着社会主义前途和人类命运的大搏斗。在这场严峻的考验中，肖洛霍夫赤裸裸地暴露了他反对人民战争的丑恶面目。他在战争年代所写的政论、小说，不去歌颂苏联军民的革命英雄主义，而是竭力散布悲观失望的情绪。战争才打了两年，他就在《致美国友人》的信中发出亡国的哀嚎。他绝望地悲诉：“我们的国家，我们的人民已被战争摧残得遍体鳞伤”，并奴颜婢膝地乞求美国出兵，把希望完全寄托在美帝国主义身上。
    第二次世界大战后，亚非拉人民革命斗争风起云涌。这时，他又跟着赫鲁晓夫跳了出来，疯狂反对人民战争。他被美帝的核讹诈吓破了胆，惊呼“氢弹的魔影”“正摧残着生活欢乐的阳光”，说什么“人类在我们今天的主要目标，就是为和平而斗争”，完全取消了把无产阶级世界革命进行到底的根本任务。毛主席教导我们：“凡属正义的革命的战争，其力量是很大的，它能改造很多事物，或为改造事物开辟道路”，“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”而肖洛霍夫却到处大声疾呼“对战争说‘不要’”，胡说“任何一种战争都不会创造任何东西。战争就是破坏者”。为了“活下去”，他竟然同帝国主义、各国反动派勾结在一起，叫嚣要“集体起来”反对人民革命战争。
    在苏共二十大后急忙抛出来的大毒草《一个人的遭遇》就是他反对人民革命战争的罪证。肖洛霍夫在小说里，通过叛徒索科洛夫在卫国战争中的所谓“悲惨遭遇”，大肆渲染战争的“苦难”和“恐怖”，为向敌人屈膝投降的叛徒大唱赞歌，恶毒地咒骂伟大的反法西斯战争“埋葬了”苏联人民的“最后的欢乐和希望”。在亚非拉人民战争怒潮澎湃的今天，作者进行这种和平主义、投降主义的宣传，苏修集团还把它拍成电影流毒全世界，这是对世界革命的大叛卖！作为苏共二十大的产物，小说也正是在这点上艺术地体现了苏修集团的“和平共处”总路线，因此，苏修文艺界吹捧它“奠定了现代文学新方向的开端”。赫鲁晓夫也夸奖它是“卓越的短篇小说”。小说发表后，一大批象《一寸土》、《士兵的颂歌》、《生者与死者》那种大反斯大林、恶毒诅咒革命战争的毒草竞相出笼。苏修文艺大反革命战争的黑风就是肖洛霍夫刮起来的。
      复辟资本主义的急先锋
    斯大林逝世后，社会主义苏联又一次面临着两种命运两种前途的大决战。在这个重大历史关头，肖洛霍夫更是完全撕下假面具，进一步亮出了自己反革命的真面目。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。”肖洛霍夫就是为赫鲁晓夫篡党篡政制造舆论的急先锋。斯大林死后的第二年，他就带头在苏联作协第二次代表大会上兴风作浪，全盘否定斯大林时期革命文艺的成就，声嘶力竭地煽动作家们“从子弹匣里取出生了锈的子弹，换些比较新的子弹”，起来解决所谓“二十年来使人惴惴不安的问题”，把矛头直接指向他曾称之为“亲爱的终生都热爱的父亲”的斯大林。在苏共二十大时，他更是赤膊上阵，公然号召罢斯大林时期文艺界党的领导人的官。
    肖洛霍夫一方面大反斯大林，一方面又疯狂地为赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线摇旗呐喊，狂热地为复辟资本主义唱赞歌。他把彻头彻尾修正主义的《苏共纲领》吹上了天，说它是什么“新鲜宜人的清风”，“向着人类照耀的光辉”，“不可摧毁的纪念碑”。他对赫鲁晓夫在经济上采取福利主义、物质刺激等一系列修正主义政策备加赞赏，胡说这一切将“在国营农场工人和农庄庄员面前展现着美好的前景”。他甚至厚颜无耻地把由于赫鲁晓夫在工农业中大搞资本主义复辟而造成的大倒退、大灾难，说成是“空前壮举”，并肉麻地吹捧赫鲁晓夫的反动统治是“充满着敢作敢为的创造精神的美好时代”。
    毛主席指出：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”肖洛霍夫在苏共二十大后，为了同赫鲁晓夫“步伐一致”，又急急忙忙炮制出《被开垦的处女地》（第二部）这棵大毒草，利用历史题材，“巧妙地”“紧密地”为苏修集团现实的修正主义政治路线效劳，鼓吹在苏联复辟资本主义。在这一部小说里，指导农庄党组织领导人行动的是赫鲁晓夫所喋喋不休的什么“一切为了人，一切为了人的幸福”，“人和人是朋友、同志和兄弟。”这些领导人对庄员中自发资本主义势力不批判不斗争，一味迁就姑息，任其泛滥；对疯狂破坏集体经济的潜伏的反动军官、反动富农，或者丧失警惕，或者纵容包庇。这种不要无产阶级专政、不要社会主义的“集体农庄”，已经完完全全资本主义化了。
    肖洛霍夫还利用苏修集团赏给他的特殊地位，在文艺界系统地推行赫鲁晓夫的修正主义文艺黑线。
    他竭力反对列宁的文学党性原则和毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，积极鼓吹“全民文艺”。为了掩盖苏修文艺为一小撮新老资产阶级服务的阶级本质，他把文学说成是“良心的事业”，胡说艺术家所从事的一切都是“为了人，为了人类”。
    他竭力反对作家进行思想改造，妄图用赫鲁晓夫兜售的“同人民生活保持密切联系”代替作家与工农兵结合，以此维护苏修作家特权地位。肖洛霍夫本人就是住在别墅里“同人民生活保持密切联系”的。他公然宣称：“对我来说，没有什么要‘下乡’的问题”，这“很费时间，会影响创作。”
    他猖狂反对批判资产阶级文艺，大力扶植文艺界新老牛鬼蛇神。大叛徒帕斯捷尔纳克在他的眼里是“有才华的诗人”，对一大批自称为“苏共二十大的产儿”的反动青年作家，他更视为“真正的财富”，竭力主张把他们拉进作协领导机构，生怕苏修文艺绝了种。
    他一贯反对革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，反对文艺表现工农兵英雄形象，狂热鼓吹旨在丑化社会主义、丑化无产阶级专政的“写真实”、“写动摇人物”等一整套修正主义文艺理论。
    苏修评论家吹嘘“今天苏联文学的总路线，它的人民性、它的内容和形式，都是和肖洛霍夫的名字联系在一起的。”这真是不打自招！
    十几年来，肖洛霍夫为苏修领导集团复辟资本主义的政治路线效劳真是呕心沥血，苏修领导集团对他也格外宠爱。一九五九年赫鲁晓夫亲自登门拜访，把他立为苏修作家的“光辉榜样”，赋予“苏联文化界全权代表”的身份。随后，又给他挂上一个个奖章、勋章，一个个诸如“全苏作协理事会书记”、“最高苏维埃代表”、“苏共中央委员”的头衔。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团上台以后，也授予肖洛霍夫“社会主义劳动英雄”的称号。实际上，他已成了苏修文艺界最大的资产阶级代表人物，成了苏修特权阶层在文艺界的头号代表。
        帝国主义的忠实奴才
    毛主席指出：“资产阶级影响的存在，是修正主义的国内根源。屈服于帝国主义的压力，是修正主义的国外根源。”肖洛霍夫在国内积极鼓吹复辟资本主义，在国外则为赫鲁晓夫的以“苏美合作”为灵魂的“和平共处”总路线奔命效劳。据不完全统计，苏共二十大以来，肖洛霍夫以赫鲁晓夫钦定的“苏联文化界全权代表”的身份，到资本主义国家勾勾搭搭，就达二、三十次之多。
    一九五五年，日内瓦四国首脑会议七月份收场，肖洛霍夫八月份就连忙给《外国文学》编辑部写信，倡议召开世界作家“圆桌会议”，狂热鼓吹要把所谓“日内瓦精神”“贯彻到国际性生活的各个方面去”。他还特别迷恋于“苏美文化交流”。
    一九五九年，他陪同赫鲁晓夫到美国和艾森豪威尔举行戴维营会谈。这次会谈开创了苏美公开勾结反对世界革命的罪恶历史，可是肖洛霍夫却为它大造气氛，大造舆论。会谈前夕，他就叫嚷：“让我们互相往来吧！我们没有什么可争论和斗争的”，鼓吹“相互出版书籍、举办展览会，相互了解我们的人民，岂不比放高射炮更好吗？”会谈结束，他又兴高采烈地夸奖赫鲁晓夫这次大叛卖“真棒，太棒了！”
    一九六三年，苏修集团伙同美英在莫斯科签订了三国部分禁止核试验条约，公开同以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派结成反革命“神圣同盟”。条约签订当天，肖洛霍夫就连忙在欧洲作家会议上贩卖“莫斯科精神”，声嘶力竭地呼吁作家们应象美英苏三国“重要的政治家和外交家们”一样，“找到共同的语言”，“达成协议”，大搞帝、修、反作家的“神圣同盟”。
    从“日内瓦精神”到“莫斯科精神”，肖洛霍夫和赫鲁晓夫一主一仆，一唱一和，走着一条越来越卑鄙的叛卖道路，成为帝国主义的一名忠实奴才。
      “皇天不负有心人”。奴才的“努力”，确实得到了主子应有的“报赏”。一九六五年瑞典皇家科学院把专门“保留给西方作家和东方叛徒”的诺贝尔文学奖金赐给了他。而他的叛徒面目，至此也更加暴露无遗了！
    历史是最好的见证人。在苏联阶级斗争的每个重大历史关头，肖洛霍夫都扮演了背叛无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的可耻角色。他自己曾这样装模作样地说过：“背叛永远都是最卑鄙、最肮脏、最为人不齿的事”。但这却正是他一生所从事的“事业”，其卑鄙、肮脏、无耻，就是倾顿河之水，也是洗刷不掉的！
    史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命大大鼓舞和推动了全世界革命人民的革命斗争。有着十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，总有一天会起来大造苏修领导集团的反。今天，我们把肖洛霍夫揪到毛泽东思想阳光下示众；明天，肖洛霍夫决逃脱不了苏联革命人民的严厉审判！苏联人民一定会把他连同勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流彻底埋葬！
