The reactionary rule of the Ne Win clique has brought about a severe national disaster. Agriculture has collapsed, industry and commerce have declined, and the economy has fallen into a serious crisis. The broad masses of laboring people are in extreme poverty and strongly resent the reactionary rule of Ne Win.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Yangon: The fascist military clique of Ne Win has, in the five years since it came to power, caused the collapse of agriculture, the decline of industry and commerce, and plunged Myanmar's economy into a serious crisis. The broad masses of laboring people are in a state of extreme poverty, with food and clothing scarce.

Myanmar is a country known for its rice production and is one of the world's major rice-exporting nations. Since the Ne Win fascist military clique took power, Myanmar's farmers have not only continued to suffer from the brutal exploitation of the landlord class but have also been subjected to the plundering of the Ne Win clique. As a result, the majority of farmers have gone bankrupt and are unable to engage in farming, leading to vast tracts of fertile land lying fallow. The agriculture minister of the Ne Win reactionary government, Dongji, admitted in March this year that Myanmar has about six hundred acres of land "left uncultivated" each year. This figure accounts for more than a quarter of Myanmar's total cultivated land of over 21 million acres. The Ne Win reactionary government, using "natural disasters" as an excuse, admitted that agricultural production has decreased by tens of percent each year, and the actual situation this year is even more severe.

Due to the bankruptcy of farmers and the sharp decline in rice production, coupled with the widespread resistance by farmers to forced procurement, the amount of rice procured by the Ne Win reactionary government has decreased year by year. In the past, Myanmar could procure 250 million baskets of commercial grain each year (each basket weighs approximately 46 pounds); but this year, despite the Ne Win reactionary government dispatching troops to the Irrawaddy Delta region to forcibly seize rice from farmers and conducting house-to-house searches in the vicinity of Mandalay, according to a bulletin issued by the Myanmar Ministry of Trade, the amount of rice seized this year is only 101.9 million baskets.

Facing a severe food shortage, the Ne Win reactionary government implements a policy of "exporting hunger," strictly controlling the sale of rice within the country, and implementing a rationing system nationwide. In large cities like Yangon, each person is supplied with about 0.7 pounds of rice per day. In Mandalay, each person is supplied with 16 cans of milk per month, with no supply for those under three years old. In Mawlamyine, each person is supplied with only 13 cans of milk per month.

The collapse of agriculture has affected various sectors of the national economy. In 1965, Myanmar's industrial production decreased by 40%, and in 1966, it decreased by more than 30%. Industries such as rice milling and food processing, which account for nearly half of the total industrial output, are in a state of semi-idleness due to a lack of grain. Industries such as textiles, fishing, and small metalwork are also in a state of decline. According to incomplete statistics, more than 20,000 looms in Myanmar have stopped operating.

Due to the collapse of agriculture, Myanmar's rice exports decreased from 17 million tons in the 1962-1963 fiscal year to 4.7 million tons this year, and foreign exchange earnings also plummeted. As a result, the necessary equipment and parts for domestic industry and transportation cannot be imported. Now, many factories have stopped operating due to machine failures, and many cars cannot be driven. In regions such as Taunggyi, 200 out of 500 cars are unable to operate due to a lack of parts.

According to newspaper reports, the number of unemployed and underemployed people in Myanmar has reached 2.8 million, accounting for 12% of the total population, an increase of about tenfold compared to 1962.

Moreover, the Ne Win reactionary government has implemented a so-called "commercial nationalization" policy, monopolizing the operation of 426 types of goods nationwide, including matches, garlic, and onions; this has effectively eliminated almost all wholesalers and retailers, making the already scarce market supply even more tense. Nowadays, in various parts of Myanmar, shop doors are tightly closed, and the shelves of state-run cooperatives are empty. Prices are soaring, and the black market is rampant. The Ne Win reactionary government implements a rationing system for daily necessities in large cities, but due to frequent shortages, the rationing system is practically meaningless. The supply of textiles is also very tight. In recent years, there has been very little supply of textiles in rural areas of Myanmar. Farmers in various places are dressed in rags, and some can only cover themselves with broken cloth, flour bags, or sacks.

The evil rule of the Ne Win reactionary government has only enriched the small number of military warlords, compradors, and bureaucratic capitalists. Corrupt officials buy villas and cars, squandering money. Large speculators, high-ranking government officials, and military police collude to engage in large-scale speculation. They buy agricultural products in rural areas, sell them at high prices in cities, and then steal oil, salt, cloth, and other items from state-run stores to sell in rural areas, making huge profits. The Ne Win reactionary regime has ruled Myanmar for five years, bringing such severe disasters to the broad masses of laboring people in Myanmar, and has aroused strong resentment among them. This dooms it to inevitable destruction.

　　奈温集团的反动统治造成深重的民族灾难
　　农业破产，工商业凋蔽，经济陷入严重危机之中广大劳动人民极度贫困对奈温反动统治强烈不满
    据新华社讯　仰光消息：奈温法西斯军人集团五年来的反动统治，造成缅甸的农业破产，工商业凋敝，使缅甸的经济陷于严重的危机中，广大劳动人民处于食不果腹、衣不蔽体的极端贫困的境地。
    缅甸是一个盛产稻米的农业国，也是世界上输出大米的主要国家之一。奈温法西斯军人集团上台后，缅甸农民不仅继续遭受地主阶级的残酷剥削，而且又受到奈温集团的疯狂掠夺，因而广大农民破产，无力从事耕作，大批良田荒芜。奈温反动政府的农业部长东季在今年三月承认，缅甸每年约有六百英亩土地“休耕”。这个数字占缅甸总耕地面积二千一百多万英亩的四分之一还多。奈温反动政府以“自然灾害”为借口，承认农业历年减产百分之十几到二十几，今年的实际情况更加严重。
    由于农民破产、稻米生产急剧下降，再加上农民广泛开展抵制征购的群众运动，奈温反动政府稻谷收购量逐年下降。过去缅甸每年可以收购到商品粮二亿五千万箩（每箩约四十六磅）；而今年，奈温反动政府尽管派出了军队在缅中和三角洲地区强迫农民交售稻谷，并在曼德勒附近逐户查抄，但是，据缅甸贸易部发表的公告，本年度搜刮到的稻谷才一亿零一百九十万箩。
    面对严重的粮荒，奈温反动政府实行“饥饿出口”的政策，严格控制国内大米的销售量，在全国推行口粮配给制。象仰光这样的大城市，每人每天供应一牛奶罐（约零点七磅）大米。曼德勒每人每月十六牛奶罐，三岁以下不供应。毛淡棉每人每月只有十三牛奶罐。
    缅甸农业破产影响到国民经济的各部门。在一九六五年，缅甸工业生产就下降百分之四十，一九六六年又下降了百分之三十多。占工业总产值的近一半的碾米、食品等工业，因为粮食缺乏，都处于半停工状态。纺织、捕鱼、小五金等行业也很不景气。据不完全统计，缅甸全国已有二万多台织布机停工。
    缅甸由于农业破产，大米出口量从一九六二年到一九六三年度的一百七十万吨，下降到本年度的四十七万吨，外汇收入也急剧下降，因而国内工业和交通所需的设备、零件无法进口。现在，许多工厂因为机器失修而停工，许多汽车不能开动。东枝等地区五百辆汽车中有二百辆因缺零件而停驶。
    根据报纸材料，缅甸失业和半失业人口已达二百八十万，占总人口的百分之十二，比一九六二年增加约十倍。
    不仅如此，奈温反动政府还实行了所谓“商业国有化”的政策，垄断了全国四百二十六种物资的经营权，其中甚至包括火柴、大蒜、葱头等在内；这就取缔了差不多全部批发和零售商，使物资极端缺乏的市场供应更加紧张。现在，缅甸各地，商店大门紧闭，官办合作社的货架上空空荡荡，物价飞涨，黑市猖獗。奈温反动政府在大城市实行日用品凭证供应，因经常缺货，凭证供应等于空话。纺织品的供应也极为紧张。几年来，缅甸农村很少供应纺织品。各地农民穿着破烂不堪，有的只能用破布、面粉袋或麻袋蔽体。
    奈温反动政府的罪恶统治，只是养肥了占人口极少数的军阀、买办、官僚资产阶级。暴富的官员购置洋房、汽车，挥金如土。大投机商、政府高级官员和军警串通一气，进行大规模的投机倒把活动。他们在农村收购农产品，运往城市高价出售，然后盗窃官办商店的油、盐、布等运到农村，牟取暴利。奈温反动小王朝统治缅甸五年来，给缅甸广大劳动人民带来如此深重的灾难，激起了缅甸广大劳动人民强烈的不满，这就注定了它必然走向灭亡的命运。
