Beijing No. 23 Middle School's revolutionary teachers and students are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking "criticizing self and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, and fully resuming classes to make revolution.

The school's classes have fully resumed, focusing mainly on criticizing self and criticizing revisionism. At the same time, some cultural knowledge and physical, literary, and military training are also conducted. Currently, each class generally arranges courses in politics, Chinese, mathematics, and military training. Some classes also offer physics and chemistry, and plan to gradually add foreign language (elective), biology, and labor courses.

The school's full resumption of classes to make revolution has the following characteristics:

1. **Implementing "Criticizing Self and Criticizing Revisionism" as the Guiding Principle.** The revolutionary teachers and students say: Resuming classes to make revolution is to carry out a great revolution of criticizing self and criticizing revisionism, breaking old things and establishing new ones. Nowadays, the morning and part of the afternoon are mainly used for criticizing self and criticizing revisionism. Each class has established many small groups for criticizing self and criticizing revisionism, and teaching reform research groups. They bring problems from the revolutionary criticism and the school's struggle, criticism, and reform to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold discussions, criticism meetings, and write big-character posters, criticism articles, teaching reform plans, and teaching outlines. The revolutionary criticism and the school's struggle, criticism, and reform are carried out both vigorously and solidly. Not long ago, the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and the Military Training Command of the Beijing Garrison held a revolutionary criticism on-the-spot meeting in this school to promote their experiences.

2. **Establishing the Absolute Authority of Mao Zedong Thought and Promoting Proletarian Politics.** After resuming classes to make revolution, a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has been launched. The entire school's revolutionary teachers and students, taking classes as units, insist on reading Chairman Mao's works every day, forming an "unbreakable by thunder" system. Recently, the school has also set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In teaching reform, the revolutionary teachers and students first study Chairman Mao's educational thoughts, using Chairman Mao's educational thoughts as guidance to carry out teaching reform.

3. **Fully Mobilizing and Relying on the Broad Revolutionary Masses, Teaching While Reforming, Practicing While Summarizing, and Improving Continuously.** The revolutionary teachers and students say, Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and taste it yourself." We cannot wait for others to plan for us and come up with complete schemes. We must dare to explore in practice. The school's revolutionary teachers and students, together with the revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing Normal University's teaching reform investigation team and the military training team's PLA comrades, have already proposed the fourth school-wide teaching reform plan and put it into practice. The broad revolutionary teachers and students are continuously supplementing, modifying, and perfecting it in practice.

4. **Teachers Teach, Students Also Teach; Teachers First Become Students of the Students, Students Also Become Teachers; Mutual Benefit, Teaching and Learning from Each Other.** This changes the past method of teachers lecturing and students listening. Teachers have broken away from the past small circle of just teaching and changed the phenomenon of being detached from students, going to the students to criticize self and criticize revisionism together, participate in military training, study, and engage in teaching reform together.

5. **Gradually Establishing a New Revolutionary Order.** Currently, more than 1,600 teachers and students in the entire school, with 95% attending school regularly, and many classes having all students back to school to resume classes and make revolution. Various activities are carried out in an orderly and planned manner. Generally, after the morning military training and "daily reading" classes, there are two political classes for criticizing self and criticizing revisionism. The first two classes in the afternoon also conduct activities for criticizing self and criticizing revisionism, or teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other cultural knowledge. Before dinner, there is one class for literary and physical activities. Teachers and students who have something to do and cannot come to school must request leave. Revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline are strengthened, and a united, tense, serious, and lively atmosphere is gradually forming.

Chairman Mao pointed out in his May 7, 1966 directive: "Students are the same. They should focus on learning while also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 23 Middle School deeply feel that only by fully resuming classes and making revolution can they gradually implement Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts in practice. They are determined, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7" directive, to continuously reform the teaching system and content in the process of resuming classes and making revolution, daring to explore and gradually establish a brand-new proletarian educational system, and turn the school into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 北京二十三中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗全面复课闹革命  做斗私批修先锋　当教学改革闯将

    北京二十三中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗全面复课闹革命
    做斗私批修先锋　当教学改革闯将
    据新华社二十一日讯北京第二十三中学的革命师生，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，全面复课闹革命。
    这个学校的各班级全面复课闹革命，主要是搞斗私批修。同时，学点文化知识和搞点文体军训。目前，全校各班一般都安排了政治、语文、数学、军训课程，还有些班开设了物理、化学课，并且准备逐步增设外语（选读）、生物和劳动课。
    这个学校全面复课闹革命的特点是：
    一、贯彻了以“斗私，批修”为纲。革命师生们说：复课闹革命，就是进行一场斗私批修、破旧立新的大革命。现在每天上午，以及下午的一部分时间，主要是搞斗私批修，班级建立的许多斗私批修小组和教改研究小组，带着革命大批判和本单位斗批改中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，开座谈会、讨论会、批判会，写革命的大字报、批判文章、教改方案和教学提纲。革命大批判和本单位的斗批改，搞得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。不久以前，北京市革命委员会和北京卫戍区军训指挥部，还在这个学校召开了北京市中学革命大批判现场会，推广他们的经验。
    二、大立毛泽东思想绝对权威，突出了无产阶级政治。复课闹革命后，首先掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动高潮。全校革命师生以班级为单位，坚持天天读毛主席著作，形成了“雷打不散”的制度。最近，学校又办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在教学改革中，革命师生也是首先学习毛主席的教育思想，以毛主席的教育思想为指导，进行教学改革。
    三、充分发动和依靠广大革命群众，边教学，边改革，边实践，边总结，边提高。革命师生们说，毛主席教导我们：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”我们不能等着叫别人给我们订出计划，搞出完整的方案来，我们要在实践中大胆探索。这个学校的革命师生和北京师范大学教改调查组的革命师生、军训团的解放军同志一起，已经提出第四个全校教学改革计划的革命方案，并且付诸实践，由广大革命师生在实践中去不断补充、不断修改、不断完善。
    四、教师教，学生也教；教师首先做学生的学生，学生也当先生；相得益彰，教学相长。这就改变了过去单纯的教师讲、学生听的方法。教师跳出了过去除上课外就是教师在一起的小圈子，改变了和学生脱离的现象，到学生中去一起斗私批修，一起参加军训，一起学习，一起搞教改。
    五、逐步建立革命的新秩序。目前，全校一千六百多名师生，经常到校的人数达百分之九十五，许多班的学生已全部到校复课闹革命。各项活动有计划有秩序地在进行。一般是上午上了军训课、“天天读”课之后，有两节政治课，进行斗私批修活动。下午头两节课也进行斗私批修活动，或者上数、理、化等文化知识课。晚饭前还有一节课搞文体活动。师生有事不能到校，都要请假。革命性、科学性和组织纪律性得到加强，一个团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的局面正在逐步形成。
    毛主席在一九六六年五月七日的指示中给教育革命指出方向：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”北京二十三中的革命师生深深感到，只有全面复课闹革命，在实践中才能逐步贯彻毛主席的教育革命思想。他们决心在毛主席“五七”指示的光辉思想指引下，在复课闹革命中，不断改革教学制度和教学内容，大胆探索和逐步建立崭新的无产阶级教育制度，把学校办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
