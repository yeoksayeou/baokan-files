	Look at the red tides sweeping over all the mountains, with every layer of forest dyed red; the vast river is clear blue, and countless boats vie with each other in sailing.
	At the moment of the 18th anniversary of the birth of New China, we reread these magnificent and heroic lines, feeling even more intimate and greatly inspired!
	The thousand-year history is being rewritten, and the ten-thousand-li rivers and mountains are adorned in red. The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has written a new chapter in the thousand-year history of our motherland and adorned our ten-thousand-li rivers and mountains with brilliant red.
	The surging waves are fierce, and the battle of ten thousand horses is still intense. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, form a vast revolutionary army. They unite, criticize, and struggle, destroying the Four Olds, attacking evil, capturing the black dragon, and directly assaulting the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev.
	The revolution advances, and production rises. Shouldering two heavy burdens, the new song of steel and rice flowers is sung.
	The army loves the people, and the people support the army. Like the Great Wall stretching for ten thousand li, like an iron wall. The unity of the army and the people is like one person; see who can defeat us in the world?
	The waves of the Yangtze River push the previous waves forward. A new generation of communists is growing in the fiery trials, and revolutionary veterans are undergoing new tempering.
	Indeed, the mountains are red all over, and the boats vie with each other in sailing!
	The proletarian cultural revolution over the past more than a year has once again powerfully proven this great truth: the correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shines universally, dyeing the mountains and rivers of New China red; the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with boundless power, drives the revolutionary masses to "vie with each other in sailing."
	Matter turns into spirit. Our great leader Chairman Mao has summed up the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, developed Marxism-Leninism in an epoch-making way, and proposed a set of theories, lines, principles, and policies for the proletarian cultural revolution. This is a great leap.
	Spirit turns into matter. After the theories, lines, principles, and policies of Chairman Mao on the proletarian cultural revolution are grasped by hundreds of millions of people, they become a great material force, initiating a magnificent great revolution under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship. This is another great leap.
	The leap in revolutionary practice promotes the leap in people's cognition. Fifty years ago, Lenin said in "The Lessons of the Revolution": "In the revolutionary period, ten thousand people learn in one week what they would learn in a year of confused life." The proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution to prevent capitalist restoration under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, a great revolution of "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and a great revolution that touches people's souls. The boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, in this great revolution, has unprecedentedly spread and penetrated, guiding everything and transforming everything. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, "completely breaking with traditional ideas," are running swiftly on the road of thought revolutionization. In just over a year, what they have learned far exceeds what they would learn in ten or even several decades of ordinary life. "Never have we seen the people so spirited, so full of fighting spirit, and so full of vigor."
	The rising sun shines over the vast sky, and seven hundred million people in China display a new appearance.
	History is advancing, and the struggle is not over. Comrades of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat! Let us continue to make efforts, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of top leaders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smash selfishness and establish public spirit, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Let the brilliant sunlight of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought shine over the globe and illuminate for all eternity!

    万山红遍
    辛午
    看万山红遍，层林尽染；漫江碧透，百舸争流。
    在新中国诞生十八周年的时刻，我们重读这些豪迈壮丽的诗句，更觉亲切，格外振奋！
    千年青史写新篇，万里河山披红装。毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，为祖国的千年青史写下了崭新的篇章，为我们的万里河山披上了鲜红的盛装。
    奔腾急，万马战犹酣。亿万革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，大联合，大批判，大斗争，破四旧，征腐恶，缚鲲鹏，直捣以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。
    革命向前进，生产往上升。两副重担一肩挑，钢水稻花谱新歌。
    军爱民，民拥军。犹如万里长城，恰似铜墙铁壁。军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？
    长江后浪推前浪。共产主义的一代新人在烈火中成长，革命的老前辈经受着新的锻炼。
    真个是：万山红遍，百舸争流！
    一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，再一次雄辩地证明了这个伟大的真理：代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。光焰无际的毛泽东思想，阳光普照，染红了新中国的万山千水；战无不胜的毛泽东思想，威力无穷，推动着革命群众的“百舸争流”。
    物质变精神。我们伟大的领袖毛主席总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，划时代地发展了马克思列宁主义，提出了一整套无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策。这是一个伟大的飞跃。
    精神变物质。毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，为亿万群众掌握以后，就成为巨大的物质力量，在无产阶级专政条件下，掀起了一场波澜壮阔的大革命。这是又一个伟大的飞跃。
    革命实践的飞跃，推动着人们认识上的飞跃。五十年前，列宁在《革命的教训》一文中说过：“在革命时期千百万人民一个星期内学到的东西，比他们平常在一年糊涂的生活中所学到的还要多。”无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下防止资本主义复辟的大革命，是“斗私，批修”的大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命。光焰无际的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在这场大革命中，空前地普及，空前地深入，统帅着一切，改造着一切。亿万革命群众，“同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂”，在思想革命化的大道上迅跑。他们在短短一年多时间里学到的东西，大大超过平常的十年以至几十年，“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”
    旭日东升照长空，七亿神州展新容。
    历史在前进，斗争未结束。无产阶级革命派的战友们！让我们再接再厉，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底批倒批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，大破私字，大立公字，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照全球，闪耀万代！
