The striking workers fought back fiercely. The struggle lasted for several hours, and 24 workers were arrested.

	On the same day, striking dock workers in London also used rotten eggs to fight against right-wing union leaders who came to break the strike. More than 16,000 dock workers in London and Liverpool have been on strike for two to four weeks; they decided on October 16 to continue the struggle.
