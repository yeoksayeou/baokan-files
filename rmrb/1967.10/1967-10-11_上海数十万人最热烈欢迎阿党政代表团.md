In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the source of the great "January Revolution" storm, Shanghai, is in high spirits today. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses lined the thirty-li route from the airport to the hotel, giving the warmest and most enthusiastic welcome to the glorious messengers from the "Land of Eagles"—the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu.

The Albanian comrades arrived in Shanghai accompanied by Comrades Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Liu Xiao, Luo Guibo, and others.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the PLA Shanghai Garrison, including Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Liao Zhenguo, Rao Shoukun, Zhou Jianping, Wang Shaoyong, and Ma Tianhui, as well as leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations, were at the airport to warmly welcome the Albanian comrades.

At 11:45 AM, when the special plane carrying the Albanian Party and Government Delegation landed at the airport, the welcoming crowd burst into enthusiastic cheers. Drums and gongs resounded, and songs echoed through the air. People waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Comrade Shehu, Comrade Aliya, and other Albanian comrades, accompanied by Comrades Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, and others, stepped off the plane. The band played the "Tirana-Beijing" melody, and Comrades Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Liao Zhenguo, and others went forward to shake hands and embrace the Albanian comrades warmly. Thousands of people in the welcoming crowd read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha. Some fighters from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters rushed forward to pin red "Rebel" armbands on the Albanian comrades and presented them with exquisite souvenirs featuring Chairman Mao's portrait and poems.

Accompanied by Comrades Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan, Comrade Shehu and others walked around the airport to meet with the Shanghai revolutionary masses. The crowd shouted, "Long live the great friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!" "Down with U.S. imperialism headed by the United States!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Comrade Shehu and others warmly shook hands with the welcoming crowd and greeted them enthusiastically.

Then, Comrade Shehu, accompanied by Comrades Kang Sheng and Zhang Chunqiao, and Comrade Aliya, accompanied by Comrades Li Fuchun and Yao Wenyuan, each boarded an open-top car and left the airport. Along the streets leading to the hotel, countless red flags and banners formed a sea of red. Among the tens of thousands of welcoming people were workers, peasants, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from various departments. They were filled with revolutionary fervor, singing revolutionary songs of China and Albania, waving the national flags of both countries, and shouting enthusiastic slogans. Along the way, Comrade Shehu and Comrade Aliya waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the open-top cars and greeted the welcoming crowd warmly.

Also present at the airport to welcome the delegation were Albanian comrades visiting Shanghai and Albanian students studying in Shanghai.

The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held a grand banquet tonight to give the warmest welcome to the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu.

Central leaders accompanying the Albanian comrades to Shanghai, including Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Liu Xiao, and Luo Guibo, as well as responsible comrades from relevant central departments, attended the banquet.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the PLA Shanghai Garrison, including Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Liao Zhenguo, Rao Shoukun, Zhou Jianping, Wang Shaoyong, and Ma Tianhui, as well as leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, attended the banquet.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao and Comrade Aliya made enthusiastic speeches at the banquet.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao first, on behalf of the Shanghai workers and peasants, the PLA troops stationed in Shanghai, the Shanghai Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and the people of Shanghai, extended the warmest welcome to Comrade Shehu and all members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao said, the heroic Albanian people, under the wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, have consistently adhered to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism in the midst of enemy encirclement, holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and displaying great heroic fighting spirit.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Albanian people in all aspects of socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said, every victory of the Albanian people brings great encouragement to the people of Shanghai.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao said, our great leader Chairman Mao praises the heroic people of Albania as "a great socialist beacon in Europe." Now, this great socialist beacon shines more and more brilliantly, illuminating the path forward for revolutionary people. We feel greatly honored and proud of this.

After introducing the tremendous changes that have taken place in Shanghai over the past year, Comrade Zhang Chunqiao said, in January, at the critical moment when the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary masses were fighting to seize power from a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, many workers from factories in Albania sent us many enthusiastic telegrams and letters. All of this is the greatest support and encouragement from our brotherly Albanian people to the Shanghai proletariat and the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary masses.

In the midst of warm applause, Comrade Aliya delivered a speech filled with revolutionary friendship. He said, the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has inspired and boosted the morale of the people of the world, all revolutionary factions, and genuine Marxist-Leninists to fight against U.S.-led imperialism, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and reactionaries in various countries. He pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, with its mighty force, has swept away all revisionism and bourgeois filth, opening up a bright future for China's socialist cause and the communist cause.

Comrade Aliya said, when we see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the wise and far-sighted leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, advancing from victory to victory and dealing a devastating blow to the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, we are all greatly pleased. This revolution, unprecedented in history, has greatly raised the consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, peasants, soldiers, and youth, and has greatly promoted their ideological revolutionization. Comrade Aliya pointed out that in the revolutionary furnace, a new generation of revolutionaries is being forged, and the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will forever proudly fly over the great socialist country of China. This is the reliable guarantee.

Comrade Aliya then spoke about the fighting friendship and steel-like unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania. He emphasized that the peoples and parties of Albania and China are inseparable comrades and close allies in the common cause of socialism and revolution. They support each other, learn from each other, and fight side by side.

The banquet was filled with a highly enthusiastic atmosphere of unity and struggle from beginning to end. The hosts and guests had cordial conversations, raised their glasses frequently, and toasted to the great friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and to the health of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Also present at the banquet were Albanian comrades visiting Shanghai and Albanian students studying in Shanghai.

After the banquet, the Albanian comrades watched the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl."

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu concluded their friendly visit to Wuhan and left Wuhan this morning aboard a special plane, accompanied by Comrades Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Liu Xiao, and Luo Guibo, to visit Shanghai. The distinguished guests were given a warm send-off by thousands of revolutionary masses and military personnel at the airport.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Commander-in-Chief of the PLA Air Force Wu Faxian were at the airport to see off the Albanian comrades. Also present at the airport to see them off were responsible comrades of the PLA Wuhan Garrison, including Zhang Siyu and Liu Feng.

Also present at the airport to see them off were: responsible comrades of the PLA Wuhan Garrison, including Xu Guofu, Zhang Yuhua, and Xiao Qian; responsible comrades of the Wuhan Air Force, including Fang Ming and Zhang Chunqing; revolutionary leading cadres, including Sun Dezhu; and responsible comrades of various revolutionary mass organizations in the Wuhan region, and others.

Comrade Shehu, accompanied by Comrades Kang Sheng and Zhang Chunqiao, waved to the revolutionary masses lining the streets as they passed through the city in an open-top car.
