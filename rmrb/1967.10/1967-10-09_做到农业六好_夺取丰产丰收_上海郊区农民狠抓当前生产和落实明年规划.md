In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the suburbs of Shanghai have been making waves and advancing victoriously. Following the bumper harvests of summer grain, early rice, and corn, the autumn crops are now showing signs of a bountiful harvest. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, filled with the spirit of victory, are further implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are focusing on current production and implementing next year's production plan, determined to achieve the "six good practices" in agriculture. They strive to secure a comprehensive bumper harvest this year and prepare for an even greater leap in agricultural production next year.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburban people's communes of Shanghai have enthusiastically discussed and studied the editorial "Achieving Six Good Practices in Agriculture During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" published in the People's Daily. They were greatly inspired and expressed their determination to achieve the "six good practices" in agriculture. They recognized that this is a serious class struggle and a crucial matter concerning whether Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people" can be successfully implemented. It is an extremely important measure for securing a comprehensive bumper harvest this year and ensuring an even greater leap in agricultural production next year. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, are most loyal to Chairman Mao and to the socialist cause. We will resolutely implement and carry out the great call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led and initiated by Chairman Mao, is the strongest driving force for the development of production. During the planting period of this year's autumn crops in the suburban areas of Shanghai, the countryside was in the midst of a high tide of criticism and struggle. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the great Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon. They combined local struggles and their personal experiences to criticize and denounce the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "exploitation is glorious," and the theory of the extinction of class struggle. Through the revolutionary criticism, the class consciousness of the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres rapidly increased. They loved Chairman Mao even more and were more determined to follow the socialist path, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. The autumn crops were planted on time, with sufficient base fertilizer and meticulous management, laying a solid foundation for this year's bumper harvest.

Facing the unprecedentedly good situation of revolutionary and production development in the countryside, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully said, "A thousand victories, ten thousand victories, relying on Mao Zedong Thought is victory." They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to carry out the revolutionary criticism movement more extensively and deeply. At the same time, they will consciously follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "promoting the overall situation" and "taking grain as the key link." On the basis of fully implementing the autumn sowing plan, they will strive to improve autumn sowing and secure an even greater bumper harvest in agriculture.

    做到农业六好　夺取丰产丰收
    上海郊区农民狠抓当前生产和落实明年规划
    据新华社上海八日电　在无产阶级文化大革命中乘风破浪，胜利前进的上海郊区农村，继夏粮和早稻、玉米丰收以后，秋熟作物又呈现一派丰收景象。广大贫下中农和革命干部满怀战斗胜利的豪情，正在进一步贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，狠抓当前生产和落实明年生产规划，决心做到农业“六好”，为夺取今年农业的全面丰收和做好明年农业更大跃进的准备工作而努力。
    上海郊区人民公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，热烈讨论学习了《人民日报》社论《在无产阶级文化大革命中做到农业六好》，受到了极大鼓舞。他们纷纷表示，做到农业“六好”，是一场严重的阶级斗争，是关系到毛主席的伟大战略方针“备战、备荒、为人民”是否能够胜利贯彻的极其重要的问题，是夺取今年农业全面丰收，保证明年农业更大跃进的极其重要的措施。我们贫下中农和革命干部最忠于毛主席，最忠于社会主义事业，对于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的这一伟大号召，坚决贯彻，坚决照办！
    毛主席亲自领导和发动的无产阶级文化大革命，是推动生产发展的一个最强大的动力。上海郊区今年的秋熟作物种植期内，正值农村进入大批判、大斗争高潮。广大革命群众和革命干部，活学活用毛主席著作，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，结合本地的斗争实际和自己的亲身经历，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”和阶级斗争熄灭论等反革命修正主义谬论。在革命大批判中，广大社员和革命干部的阶级觉悟迅速提高，他们更加热爱毛主席，更加坚定地走社会主义道路，生产的积极性大大提高。秋熟作物种植适时，基肥充足，管理精细，为今年的丰收打下了牢固的基础。
    广大贫下中农面对当前农村革命、生产蓬勃发展的空前大好形势，怀着十分喜悦的心情，兴奋地说：“千胜利，万胜利，依靠毛泽东思想就是胜利。”他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更广泛，更深入地开展革命大批判运动，同时，自觉地遵照毛主席的“要提倡顾全大局”和“以粮为纲”的教导，在全面落实秋种计划的基础上，为搞好秋种，夺取农业更大的丰收而奋斗。
