On the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, Hong Kong compatriots, in the midst of the high tide of the anti-British, anti-violence struggle, with great courage, broke through the suppression, intimidation, and sabotage of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, and celebrated the great National Day with revolutionary fervor. Eight thousand patriotic fishermen from Hong Kong and Kowloon also held a massive sea parade.

On the first day, as the sun rose from the east, Hong Kong compatriots in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the "New Territories" hoisted red flags in patriotic unions, schools, associations, and shops. In many streets in the western district of Hong Kong Island and on ships by the sea, red flags were flying, and everywhere was a scene of joy. In some areas, large banners were suspended in the sky with balloons.

More than 1,800 representatives from various circles in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the "New Territories" solemnly held a celebration meeting at the Puqing Theater in Kowloon in the morning. The representatives expressed their heartfelt wishes for the eternal life of our dearest red sun, the great leader Chairman Mao! They wished Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the closest comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, good health! The representatives paid tribute to the great socialist motherland, enthusiastically cheered for the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and for the victories achieved by Hong Kong compatriots in the anti-British, anti-violence struggle. The meeting ended with thunderous applause and cheers, passing a telegram to Chairman Mao. The telegram said: On this glorious day, we solemnly pledge to you: We will definitely study, execute, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought with all our hearts! Even if our heads are cut off and our blood is shed, Mao Zedong Thought will not be abandoned! We will definitely use your brilliant thoughts to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!

The heroic Hong Kong working class began celebrating National Day in mid-September. The Hong Kong British fascist authorities mobilized fully armed police and military to conduct large-scale searches of 29 patriotic unions' 51 venues, illegally arresting or detaining more than 100 workers, attempting to sabotage the Hong Kong workers' National Day celebrations. However, the heroic Hong Kong workers were not afraid of imperialist intimidation. They were determined, fearless of sacrifice, and celebrated National Day with even greater enthusiasm. Many unions' National Day banners were destroyed by the enemy, but the workers immediately repaired them, making them even more magnificent and splendid. Some union members preparing for National Day celebrations were illegally arrested, but the second batch of workers immediately took over. Representatives of workers from various industries who made outstanding contributions in the anti-British, anti-violence struggle, family members of martyrs, family members of arrested anti-violence fighters, and many workers and union leaders wanted by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities actively participated in the celebrations, full of fighting spirit, cheering for the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought around the world.

The vast number of young students in Hong Kong and Kowloon also broke through the numerous obstacles set by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities and launched extensive and enthusiastic National Day celebrations. Many participants in the celebration meeting were students who had broken out of the Hong Kong British brainwashing education fortress. Many of them were celebrating National Day in such a grand manner for the first time in 18 years, and many were shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" for the first time with such abandon. At the celebration meeting, many young students were so moved that they had tears in their eyes.

Farmers, fishermen, patriotic educators, journalists, cultural workers, film workers, women, businesspeople, small traders, and patriotic compatriots from various districts in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the "New Territories," began holding various forms of celebrations starting from September 21 to celebrate National Day.

In recent days, more than 8,000 patriotic fishermen from 13 ports in Hong Kong and Kowloon, aboard 700 fishing boats, sailed to various ports in Baonan County, Guangdong Province, to celebrate National Day with local fishermen and held a massive anti-British, anti-violence sea parade. It was the first time Hong Kong fishermen celebrated National Day on such a large scale since the founding of the nation.

On the first day, when the broadcast announced that Chairman Mao had ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum, more than 8,000 fishermen, like the people of the entire nation, were immersed in boundless happiness and joy. They stood on the bow of the ship, looked towards Beijing, sang "The East Is Red" in unison, and waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" repeatedly, shouting "Long live the great People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Many old fishermen, with tears in their eyes, said excitedly: With the great leader Chairman Mao and the great motherland backing us, we can hold our heads high and return to the national fishing port to celebrate National Day. This is the greatest happiness. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao! In the future, we will use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the youth, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to the great motherland; read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and fight the anti-British, anti-violence struggle to the end.

When the parade began at Tiananmen Square, more than 700 fishing boats immediately started their engines and held a massive sea parade. The five-star red flags on the masts of the fishing boats fluttered in the wind, and each bow had a portrait of Chairman Mao. The hulls were covered with red banners such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" The majestic parade fleet formed a 30-mile-long sea dragon. The ships were filled with the sound of drums and firecrackers, and the slogans "Down with the British Empire!" and "The British must fail, we must win!" mixed with the roar of the engines and firecrackers, echoing in the sea and sky for a long time.

When the parade fleet returned to the various ports of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the Hong Kong British authorities were furious and terrified by the fishermen's patriotic actions. When the parade fleet reached Qing Mountain, the water police boats and motorboats that had been hiding at the foot of the mountain suddenly rushed out, trying to obstruct and sabotage the parade fleet. The Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic fishermen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly opened their engines to the fullest, sang revolutionary songs, and shouted in unison: "Resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They braved the wind and waves, forward bravely, scaring the Hong Kong British police and military, who dared not approach the parade fleet. The "riot control team" of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, known as the "brutal team" by Hong Kong compatriots, also hid in their tents, not daring to show their heads. This action by the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic fishermen once again boosted the morale of patriotic compatriots and crushed the arrogance of British imperialism, celebrating the most glorious day of the motherland with their revolutionary actions.

On the first day, the revolutionary masses in the border areas of Baonan County held celebrations with Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. The porters in Man Kam To and the patriotic workers in the New Territories celebrated National Day together. The atmosphere of the celebration was filled with festivity. The celebration meeting venue was set up at the former police station in the New Territories bridgehead. The solemn five-star red flag flew high in the sky above the Man Kam To bridgehead. The heroic workers of Man Kam To and the patriotic workers of the New Territories defied the Hong Kong British fascist laws, beating drums, setting off firecrackers. The explosion of 300,000 firecrackers shook the valleys and fields, and the white smoke rose straight into the sky. The Hong Kong British police and military hid in the fortifications on the mountain, not daring to show their heads. More than 600 revolutionary masses and patriotic compatriots in the Shatoujiao area of the New Territories also held a celebration meeting on the first day to celebrate National Day, followed by a parade around the town. Finally, they joined the Hong Kong and Kowloon fishermen who were demonstrating at sea, cheering together "Long live the great People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

On the first day, more than 15,000 people from various circles in Macau held a celebration meeting and parade, and 40 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams held performances. Fireworks were set off at night.

    满怀革命豪情欢度国庆
    港澳同胞衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆
    港九渔民举行声势浩大的反英抗暴海上示威游行
    据新华社香港二日电  在伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年的光辉节日里，处在反英抗暴斗争高潮中的香港爱国同胞，以大无畏的英雄气概，冲破了港英法西斯当局的镇压、恐吓和破坏，满怀革命豪情欢度伟大的国庆节。港九八千爱国渔民还举行了声势浩大的海上示威游行。
    一日，朝阳刚从东方升起，香港爱国同胞就在香港、九龙和“新界”的爱国工会、学校、社团和商店，升起了一面面红彤彤的五星红旗，高悬巨幅标语。在港岛西区的许多街道和海边的船舶上，红旗飘扬，到处都是一片欢腾的景象。一些地区的上空还出现了用气球悬挂的大幅标语。
    来自港九、“新界”的各界同胞代表一千八百多人，一日上午在九龙普庆戏院隆重举行了庆祝大会。代表们在大会上衷心祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳、伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！祝毛主席最亲密的战友林彪副主席身体健康！代表们向伟大的社会主义祖国致敬，为无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就、为战无不胜的毛泽东思想、为香港同胞在反英抗暴斗争中所取得的节节胜利热烈欢呼。大会最后在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中通过了给毛主席的致敬电。致敬电说：趁这光辉的节日，我们要向您庄严宣誓：我们一定要认真学习、忠实执行、热情宣传、誓死捍卫毛泽东思想！头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！我们一定要用您的光辉思想，统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切。我们一定要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高高举起，奋勇前进！
    英雄的香港工人阶级从九月中旬就开始了国庆庆祝活动。港英法西斯当局出动了全副武装的军警，大规模地搜查正在筹备庆祝国庆活动的二十九个爱国工会的五十一个会所，非法逮捕或扣留了一百多名工人，妄图破坏香港工人庆祝国庆的活动。但是，英雄的香港工人不怕帝国主义的恐吓，下定决心，不怕牺牲，以更大的热情，把国庆庆祝活动搞得更好，更热烈。许多工会的国庆彩牌被敌人破坏了，工人马上动手把它布置得比原来的更加壮丽辉煌。一些工会庆祝国庆的筹备人员被非法逮捕了，第二批工人就立即接上去。在反英抗暴斗争中作出了杰出贡献的各业工人的代表、烈士家属、被捕抗暴战士家属以及许多被港英法西斯当局“通缉”的罢工工人和工会领导人，都积极地参加了庆祝活动，满怀战斗的激情欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界取得的伟大胜利。
    港九广大青年学生，也冲破港英法西斯当局的重重阻挠，展开了广泛而热烈的国庆庆祝活动。参加庆祝大会的有许多是从港英奴化教育堡垒中冲杀出来的学生，他们许多人是十八年来第一次这样隆重地庆祝国庆，许多人第一次这样纵情地高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”在庆祝大会上，不少青年学生激动得热泪盈眶。
    农民、渔民、爱国教育工作者、新闻工作者、文化工作者、电影工作者、妇女界、工商界、小商小贩和港九、“新界”各区街坊的爱国同胞，为了欢度国庆节，也从九月二十一日开始，分别举行了各种形式的庆祝活动。
    连日来，港九各地十三个海港的爱国渔民八千多人，分乘七百艘渔船开到祖国广东省宝安县海面各港口，同当地渔民共同欢度国庆节，并举行了声势浩大的反英抗暴海上示威游行。香港渔民们象这样大规模地庆祝国庆，还是建国以来第一次。
    一日上午，当广播里传来毛主席登上天安门城楼的喜讯时，八千多渔民和全国人民一样，沉浸在无比幸福喜悦的激情中。他们站在船头，遥望北京，齐声高唱《东方红》，频频挥动《毛主席语录》，千遍万遍地高呼“伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”许多老渔民含着满眶热泪激动地说：有伟大领袖毛主席和伟大祖国给我们撑腰，我们能够扬眉吐气，回到祖国渔港过国庆节，这是最大的幸福。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！今后，我们要用毛泽东思想教育青年，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于伟大的祖国；读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，誓把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    当天安门广场宣布游行开始的时候，七百多条渔船立即开动马达，举行声势浩大的海上示威游行。渔船桅杆顶上的五星红旗迎风招展，每条船头都挂着毛主席画像，船身周围贴满了“毛主席万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”等红色标语。威武雄壮的游行船队组成了三十多里长的海上长龙，船上锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，“打倒英帝”、“港英必败，我们必胜”的口号声和轰隆的马达声、鞭炮声交织在一起，长久地震荡着海空。
    游行的船队浩浩荡荡地返回港九各海港时，港英当局对渔民们的爱国行动恨得要命，怕得要死。当游行船队开到青山口时，早已潜伏在青山脚下的水警轮和摩托艇突然冲了出来，气势汹汹地企图阻挠和破坏游行船队前进。用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九爱国渔民毫无惧色，开足马力，高唱革命歌曲，齐声高呼：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”乘风破浪勇往直前，吓得港英军警始终不敢靠近游行船队。埋伏在山头准备镇压游行渔民的被香港爱国同胞称为“残暴队”的港英法西斯当局的“防暴队”，也龟缩在帐篷里，不敢露头。港九爱国渔民这一行动，再一次大长了爱国同胞的志气，灭了港英帝国主义的威风，用自己的革命行动庆贺了祖国最光辉的节日。
    一日，宝安县边境地区的革命群众，同港九同胞一起举行了庆祝活动。文锦渡的搬运工人和新界爱国工人一起庆祝国庆。文锦渡桥头充满了节日气氛。庆祝大会会场就设在新界桥头警察署旧址门口，庄严的五星红旗高高飘扬在文锦渡桥头上空。英雄的文锦渡工人和新界爱国工人蔑视港英法西斯法令，敲锣打鼓，燃放鞭炮。三十万枚鞭炮的爆炸声震动着山谷田野，团团白烟直冲云霄。港英军警始终躲在山上的工事里不敢露头。沙头角地区革命群众和新界沙头角地区爱国同胞六百多人，也在一日集会庆祝国庆，会后举行了环镇游行。最后，他们和海上示威的港九渔民汇合在一起，共同欢呼“伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    澳门各界同胞一万五千多人在一日举行了庆祝大会和示威游行，四十个毛泽东思想宣传队分别举行了文艺演出。入夜还燃放了节日焰火。
