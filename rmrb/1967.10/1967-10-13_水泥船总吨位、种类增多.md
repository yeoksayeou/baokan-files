    The total tonnage of cement boats produced in Jiangsu Province in the first half of this year increased by 30 percent compared to the same period last year. The variety of boats has also increased. Before the Cultural Revolution, only general-purpose agricultural boats could be produced. Now, various types of agricultural boats, such as motorized drainage boats, navigational marker boats, ammonia water boats, and powered dredging boats, can be produced. In terms of tonnage, previously only small agricultural boats of less than five tons could be built. Now, boats of up to forty tons can be manufactured.

　　水泥船总吨位、种类增多
    江苏省今年上半年生产的水泥农船，总吨位比去年同期增加了百分之三十。船的种类也增多了。在文化大革命以前，只能生产一般的农用船，现在已经能够生产机动排灌船、航标船、氨水船、动力吸泥船等多品种的农用船。在吨位上，以前只能制造五吨以下的小型农船，现在已能制造四十吨的大船了。
