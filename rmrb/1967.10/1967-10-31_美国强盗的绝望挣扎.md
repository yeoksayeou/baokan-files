Since October 24, American imperialism has continuously dispatched hundreds of aircraft to carry out extremely savage and indiscriminate bombing of the densely populated areas in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. This is a serious "escalation" step in the Johnson administration's aggression against Vietnam, committing new heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people.

The large-scale bombing of the Hanoi urban area by American air bandits fully demonstrates that the Johnson administration is a group of the most savage, brutal, and inhuman killers and war mongers in the world today. The Vietnamese people and all the people of the world will never forgive this group of unrepentant aggressors.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said, "The rampancy of all dark forces not only indicates that these dark forces still have strength, but also indicates their last struggles and the approaching victory of the people." Today, the American aggressors are engaged in such desperate struggles on the battlefield in Vietnam.

American imperialism has invested its maximum stake in the Vietnam battlefield, using all the modern weapons it can, and testing all the strategies and tactics it can think of. However, the situation in Vietnam is becoming increasingly unfavorable for the American aggressors. Recently, in the area around the Demilitarized Zone in Khe Sanh, the U.S. "elite" Marine Corps was surrounded by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, the Johnson administration is desperately recruiting cannon fodder with little success. The anger of the American people against the war in Vietnam is growing stronger. The ruling class in the United States is fraught with contradictions and disputes. The Johnson administration is in a desperate situation, at its wits' end.

It is under these circumstances that the Johnson administration has resorted to expanding the bombing, attempting to use ruthless war blackmail to threaten the Vietnamese people into laying down their arms, realizing their evil plot of "bombing to force peace," and seeking a way to avoid complete annihilation.

But this is sheer delusion! The heroic Vietnamese people are indomitable and unbreakable. American imperialism has been bombing North Vietnam for several years, but it has not shaken the Vietnamese people's iron will and determination to completely defeat the American aggressors. Will the expansion of the bombing of North Vietnam yield any different results?

On October 27, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in a letter to the heroic soldiers and people of Hanoi, pointed out: The American bandits, in their desperation, have resorted to various brutal methods in an attempt to extricate themselves from their predicament. However, the more crimes they commit, the more the Vietnamese military and people hate them and the more determined they are to defeat them.

The heroic Vietnamese people have channeled their deep hatred for the American aggressors into the barrels of their guns, mobilizing the entire nation with one heart, launching a wave of everyone fighting the air bandits. In just the past five days, the soldiers and people of Hanoi have shot down 35 American aircraft and captured a large number of American air bandits. This is a severe punishment for the American aggressor bandits!

The Chinese people, together with all revolutionary people of the world, strongly condemn the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in Vietnam, enthusiastically applaud the brilliant results of the Vietnamese people's air defense battles, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in completely defeating the American aggressor bandits and achieving final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

    美国强盗的绝望挣扎
    本报评论员
    从十月二十四日以来，美帝国主义连续出动成百架飞机，对越南民主共和国首都河内市中心的居民稠密区，进行了极其野蛮的狂轰滥炸。这是约翰逊政府侵越战争的严重“升级”步骤，对越南人民犯下了新的滔天罪行。
    美国空中强盗对河内市区的大规模轰炸充分地表明，约翰逊政府是当今世界的一伙最野蛮、最残暴、最灭绝人性的杀人犯和战争贩子，越南人民和全世界人民绝不能饶恕这一伙万恶不赦的侵略强盗。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过，一切黑暗势力的猖獗，“不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利”。美国侵略者今天在越南战场上，正是进行着这种绝望的挣扎。
    美帝国主义在越南战场上，投入了它所能投入的最大赌注，使用了它所能够使用的一切现代化武器，试验了它所能想到的一切战略战术。但是，越南战局仍然对美国侵略者越来越不妙。最近在非军事区周围的昆天，美国“王牌军”海军陆战队被南越解放军团团围困，打得死伤累累。在这同时，约翰逊政府到处搜罗炮灰，收效甚微。美国人民反对侵越战争的怒火，正越烧越旺。美国统治集团内部矛盾重重，争吵不休。约翰逊政府陷于穷途末路，一筹莫展的困境。
    正是在这种情况下，约翰逊政府只好乞灵于扩大轰炸，企图用穷凶极恶的战争讹诈手段来威胁越南人民放下武器，实现它们“以炸压和”的罪恶阴谋，寻找一条避免彻底覆灭的出路。
    但是，这不过是十足的妄想！英雄的越南人民是压不倒，炸不垮的。美帝国主义对越南北方进行了几年的狂轰滥炸，并没有丝毫动摇越南人民彻底战胜美国侵略者的钢铁意志和决心，难道现在扩大对越南北方的轰炸，就会有什么别的结果吗？
    胡志明主席十月二十七日在写给英雄的河内军民的信中指出：美国强盗在走投无路的时候，玩弄了各种残暴的手段，妄图摆脱窘境。但是，它制造的罪行越多，越南军民就越仇恨它，越决心战胜它。
    英雄的越南人民把他们对美国侵略者的满腔仇恨，凝结在炮口和枪口上，全民动员，万众一心，掀起了人人打飞贼的热潮。河内军民仅在最近五天中就击落美国飞机三十五架，活捉大批美国飞贼。这是对美国侵略强盗的严厉的惩罚！
    中国人民和全世界革命人民一道，愤怒谴责美帝国主义在越南所犯下的滔天罪行，热烈欢呼越南人民对空作战所取得的辉煌战果，坚决支持越南人民彻底打败美国侵略强盗，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
