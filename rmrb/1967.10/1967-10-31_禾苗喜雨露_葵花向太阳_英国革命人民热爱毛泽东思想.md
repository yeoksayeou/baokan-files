The British imperialists are terrified and enraged by the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in Britain. The Wilson government vainly attempts to cover the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought with its crow's wings. This is a pipe dream!

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially this year, British people have been sending letters or visiting our representative office daily, requesting Mao Zedong's works, portraits, or badges. On some days, there are as many as sixty requests. "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" (affectionately referred to as the "Little Red Book" by the British people) has become the best-selling book in Britain. According to incomplete statistics, over 100,000 copies of the "Little Red Book" have been circulated in the British Isles. In the imperialist's prestigious university, Cambridge, alone, over 2,000 to 3,000 copies have been sold. In one college, almost every student has a copy.

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate the sea, and all things grow with the sun. The British people also need Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to make their revolution. Study groups of Mao Zedong's works have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in Britain. In one place in Britain, there is a study group composed of twenty young workers. This group regularly holds study and discussion meetings on Sundays, studying and discussing Mao Zedong's quotations section by section. They closely link their studies to the realities of their own country, seriously exploring and analyzing class struggle and the correct path for revolution in their country. A writer has cut out Mao Zedong's quotations from the English version of Xinhua News Agency's telegrams and carefully pasted them into the books and magazines he reads. He said that this would remind him to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize everything.

The British people have come to realize from their own struggles that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon against imperialism and revisionism. Several thousand students at the London School of Economics held a sit-in demonstration for over ten days to oppose racism. They loudly read Mao Zedong's quotations, encouraging their comrades to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. In anti-American demonstrations, one often sees people holding red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" and raising placards with Mao Zedong's quotations. In a large anti-American demonstration against the Vietnam War, Oxford University students carried a giant cartoon of the "Paper Tiger" American imperialism. A British soldier, seeing this, agreed with the comparison of the American aggressors to paper tigers and resolutely joined the demonstration. People will also remember that when the traitor to Marxism-Leninism, Khrushchev's successor, Kosygin, visited Britain, he pretended to lay a wreath at Marx's tomb. British revolutionaries who had gathered there held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" and raised large banners reading "We Want Mao Zedong, Not Kosygin!" shouting revolutionary slogans, scaring the traitor pale and fleeing.

Especially inspiring is that British young workers and students, under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought, have significantly raised their revolutionary consciousness. Several British Young Communist League branches have already rebelled against British revisionism. Some young members are actively studying and striving to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

British revolutionary people have also bravely and tenaciously fought to propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought. A bookstore in a certain place in Britain was under surveillance by British special police for selling Mao Zedong's works. One day, the bookstore's window was smashed by thugs. The store manager was not intimidated. Following Mao Zedong's teachings of "being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing" and "resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," he vowed to continue running the bookstore and firmly defend the position of propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Many British friends wrote to express their resolute support. Some even volunteered to take turns guarding the bookstore day and night.

We warmly applaud: Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the British people are awakening. British friends have said well: "China's today is our tomorrow!" The day the British people arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought will be the day of the British imperialists' doom.

    禾苗喜雨露　葵花向太阳
    ——英国革命人民热爱毛泽东思想
    任卫东
    英帝国主义对战无不胜的毛泽东思想在英国的广泛传播，怕得要死，恨得要命。威尔逊政府妄图以它那乌鸦的翅膀遮住毛泽东思想的无际光焰。这是白日做梦！
    文化大革命以来，特别是今年以来，英国人民给我代办处去信或登门索要毛主席著作、毛主席画像或毛主席像章的，每天有二、三十起，最多的一天达六十余起。《毛主席语录》（英国人民亲切地称之为“小红书”）成为英国最畅销的书。据不完全统计，“小红书”在英伦三岛现已发行十万余册。在英帝的高等学府剑桥一地，就出售了二、三千册。某一个学院，学生几乎人手一册。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。英国人民干革命同样要靠马列主义、毛泽东思想。毛主席著作学习小组如雨后春笋般地在英国建立起来了。在英国某地有一个学习小组，由二十个青年工人组成。这个小组经常在星期日开学习讨论会，逐段学习和讨论毛主席的语录。他们紧密联系本国的现实，认真探讨分析阶级斗争和在本国进行革命的正确道路。有一位作家，把我新华社电讯稿（英文）上的毛主席语录剪下来，仔细地贴在他阅读的书刊上。他说，这样可以提醒自己，用毛泽东思想批判一切。
    英国人民从自己切身的斗争中认识到，毛泽东思想是反帝反修最强大的武器。伦敦经济学院的几千名学生，为反对种族主义举行了上十天的静坐示威。他们高声朗读毛主席语录，鼓舞战友们排除万难，去争取胜利。在反美示威的行列中，经常可以看到人们手擎红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举毛主席的语录牌。在一次反美侵越的大示威中，牛津大学的学生抬着美帝是纸老虎的巨幅漫画，一位英国士兵见了说：他很同意把美国侵略军比做纸老虎，毅然决然地加入了示威的行列。人们还会记得背叛了马列主义的苏修头目柯西金访问英国的时候，曾装模作样地到马克思墓前献花圈。早就聚集在那里的英国革命者，手里拿着《毛主席语录》，高举“要毛泽东，不要柯西金！”的大标语，高喊革命口号，把这个工贼吓得面如土色，逃之夭夭。
    特别令人鼓舞的是，英国青年工人和青年学生在毛泽东思想雨露滋润下，革命觉悟有了很大提高。已有好几个英国共青团支部，造了英修的反。一部分青年团员正在积极学习和努力宣传毛泽东思想。
    英国革命人民还为宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想进行了英勇顽强的斗争。英国某地的一个书店，因为出售毛主席著作，而受到英国警特的监视。有一天，这个书店的窗子被歹徒砸了。书店负责人没有被吓倒，他遵照毛主席的“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，表示一定要把书店办下去，坚守宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。许多英国朋友纷纷给他写信表示坚决支持。有的人还自告奋勇，日夜轮班在书店周围进行保卫。
    我们热烈欢呼：在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，英国人民正在觉醒。英国朋友说得好：“中国的今天，就是我们的明天！”英国人民用毛泽东思想武装起来之日，就是英帝国主义灭亡之时。
