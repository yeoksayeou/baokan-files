Shanghai's revolutionary masses, filled with revolutionary fervor, warmly welcomed the revolutionary artists of the Japanese Hishakuza Theater Troupe, who had just come from the side of our great leader Chairman Mao to Shanghai today.

When the artists of the Hishakuza Theater Troupe arrived in Shanghai, they held up portraits of Chairman Mao and sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. Their fighting spirit won the enthusiastic applause and cheers of the welcoming crowd.

Hundreds of revolutionary masses waiting at the station waved the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beat drums, and shouted slogans to salute the revolutionaries from the frontline against U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Japanese Communist Party revisionists.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Xu Jingxian, Feng Guozhu, and Zhu Xiqi, as well as representatives from the Shanghai branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and revolutionary mass organizations in the arts, went to the station to welcome the Japanese comrades.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has tightly bound the revolutionary peoples of China and Japan together. It is Mao Zedong Thought that guides the revolutionary artists of the Japanese Hishakuza Theater Troupe in their courageous struggle against U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Japanese Communist Party revisionists, achieving great victories. Today, comrades from China and Japan, filled with boundless respect for Chairman Mao and boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought, stood on the platform and read aloud in different languages Chairman Mao's quotations: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow the U.S. imperialists to ride roughshod over it for long." "The Communist Party of China, basing itself on the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism, has a clear understanding of the international and domestic situation, knowing that all the reactionaries at home and abroad must be defeated and can be defeated."

The atmosphere on the welcoming platform was filled with the fervent spirit of the revolutionary unity between the peoples of China and Japan.

The revolutionary artists of Hishakuza and the welcoming crowd held hands and stood shoulder to shoulder, singing together "The East Is Red" and the Japanese revolutionary song "Forward." The platform echoed with thunderous slogans: "Long live the great unity of the peoples of China and Japan! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with Japanese revisionism! Down with all reactionaries in the world!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao!"

Tonight, the revolutionary artists of Shanghai held a reception performance for the Japanese Hishakuza Theater Troupe, performing the revolutionary acrobatic dance "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

    上海人民热烈欢迎日本齿轮座剧团
    新华社上海二十五日电　今天，上海革命群众满怀革命激情，热烈欢迎刚从我们伟大领袖毛主席身边来到这里的日本齿轮座剧团的全体革命文艺战士。
    齿轮座剧团的文艺战士们抵达上海时，举着毛主席画像，唱着毛主席语录歌。他们的战斗的激情，博得了欢迎群众的热烈掌声和欢呼声。
    迎候在车站上的数百名革命群众，挥动着红色宝书《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，高呼口号，向来自反对美日反动派及日共修正主义分子斗争第一线的革命战士致敬。
    上海市革命委员会领导成员徐景贤、冯国柱、朱锡祺，以及对外友协上海分会负责人和文艺界革命群众组织的代表，前往车站欢迎日本战友。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想把中日两国革命人民紧紧地连结在一起。是毛泽东思想指引着日本齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士向美日反动派和日共修正主义分子展开英勇斗争，并取得了重大胜利。今天，中日两国战友满怀着对毛主席无限崇敬，对毛泽东思想无限热爱的心情，在站台上用不同的语言齐声朗读毛主席语录：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“中国共产党依据马克思列宁主义的科学，清醒地估计了国际和国内的形势，知道一切内外反动派的进攻，不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。”
    在欢迎的站台上，始终洋溢着中日两国革命人民战斗团结的热烈气氛。
    齿轮座的革命文艺战士和欢迎群众手挽手，肩并肩，同声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和日本革命歌曲《加油干》。站台上连连响起了雷鸣般的口号声：“中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒日修！打倒各国反动派！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    今晚，上海文艺界的无产阶级革命派为日本齿轮座剧团举行了招待演出，表演了革命杂技歌舞《无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁》。
