The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a call on the 22nd anniversary of the Lao Revolution (October 12) stating that the people of Laos are determined to fight bravely, overcome all difficulties, and decisively defeat the American aggressors.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, in its call, warmly commended the entire military and civilian population of Laos for their great contributions and brilliant victories in the struggle against American aggression and in the construction and consolidation of the liberated areas of Laos.

The call expressed gratitude to the people of the world who love peace and justice for their sympathy and support for the Lao people's struggle against American aggression.

The call said: "Although the U.S. imperialists have suffered successive defeats, they still refuse to abandon their schemes and ambitions to invade Laos. They are pushing the 'special war' in Laos to new heights. Therefore, although the Lao people's struggle against American aggression has achieved many victories, it will also face more and greater difficulties. To defend the honor and independence of the motherland, to achieve national reconciliation and the unification of the country, and to fulfill our lofty internationalist duties, the Lao people are determined to carry forward the glorious traditions of national struggle, to fear no hardships, to bear any sacrifice, and to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors. No matter how frantically and recklessly the U.S. imperialists expand the war, the Lao people are determined to defeat them!"

The call pointed out that the current task of the Lao military and civilian population is to strengthen all aspects of their forces, to defend, consolidate, and develop the political, military, economic, and cultural achievements of the liberated areas, to promote the people's struggle nationwide, and to achieve even greater victories. The call urged the people of all ethnic groups in the liberated areas to further strengthen their unity, to make active contributions to the struggle against American aggression, to resolutely defend and build a strong liberated area, and to smash all the evil schemes of the enemy to extinguish the revolutionary struggle of the Lao people.

In its final appeal, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front called on the governments and peoples of all countries in the world that love peace and justice to strongly condemn the bloody crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Lao people and to provide even stronger support for the Lao people's struggle against American aggression.

    号召书指出，老挝军民当前的任务是，大力加强各方面的力量，保卫、巩固和发展解放区的政治、军事、经济和文化，在全国范围内促进人民的斗争高潮，以便夺取更加巨大的胜利。号召书号召解放区各族人民进一步加强团结，为抗美救国斗争事业作出积极的贡献，坚决保卫和建设强大的解放区，粉碎敌人妄图扑灭老挝人民的革命斗争运动的一切恶毒阴谋。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的号召书最后呼吁全世界爱好和平与正义的国家的政府和人民强烈谴责美帝国主义对老挝人民犯下的血腥罪行，更有力地支持老挝人民的抗美救国斗争。
