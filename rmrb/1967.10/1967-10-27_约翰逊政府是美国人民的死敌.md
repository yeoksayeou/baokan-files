Recently, in Washington and more than twenty other cities in the United States, large-scale demonstrations by the American people against the Vietnam War erupted. Starting on the 20th, tens of thousands of demonstrators from all over the United States gathered in Washington, holding up signs that read, "Bring the troops back immediately!" "We won't go to Vietnam (to fight)!" "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people!" They surrounded the Pentagon and engaged in fierce struggles with the fascist military police. The American ruling class was in a state of panic, hurriedly mobilizing large numbers of troops, military police, and police from thousands of miles away in California and other states to suppress the demonstrators. This fully exposed the true nature of American imperialism as a paper tiger that fears the people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "The nature of the war determines the relationship between the government and the people; this is a historical principle." The war that American imperialism is waging in Vietnam is an unjust, aggressive war. The aggressive nature of this war has placed the Johnson government not only in a position of enmity with the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, but has also deepened its opposition to the American people.

To wage and continuously escalate the Vietnam War, the Johnson government has step by step intensified its attacks on the American people, bringing ever more severe disasters to the broad masses of the American people. It has continuously increased the budget for the Vietnam War, forcing the American people to tighten their belts even more. It has continuously sent more troops to the Vietnam battlefield, causing more American families to be destroyed. Therefore, this aggressive war will inevitably face increasingly strong resistance and opposition from the broad masses of the American people. As long as the Johnson government insists on continuing the Vietnam War, the contradictions between it and the American people will inevitably intensify, and the tide of the American people's opposition to the Vietnam War will inevitably rise more rapidly.

Facing the increasingly surging movement of the broad masses of the people to oppose the Vietnam War, the American ruling class is terrified. The Johnson government boasts every day about American "democracy" and "freedom." However, as soon as the people's demonstration movement arises, the Johnson government is frightened out of its wits, immediately dispatching large numbers of military and police to suppress the demonstrators, throwing away the cover of "democracy" and "freedom." The head of American imperialism, Johnson, even took off his shirt and cursed the American people's anti-war demonstrations as "irresponsible violent behavior and lawless behavior." This once again exposed the ugly face of the Johnson clique.

What "lawlessness"? The Johnson government goes against the will of the American people, violates the interests of the American people, insists on waging the Vietnam War, and uses violence to suppress the demonstrators. How can the American people tolerate this? The American people must rise up to resist the "law" that the American ruling class forces them to become cannon fodder, and they must rise up to overthrow the "heaven" that American imperialism oppresses them with. The American people must use revolutionary violence to counter the reactionary violence of the American reactionaries. Let the "rule of law" and "order" of the Washington masters go to hell!

The surging tide of the broad masses of the American people opposing the Vietnam War is directed against American imperialism. Modern revisionism actually wants to lead the American people's movement to oppose the Vietnam War into the "pacifist" wrong path. They try to obscure the aggressive nature of American imperialism's Vietnam War, divert the direction of the American people's struggle, and make the American people's movement to oppose the Vietnam War, as the American ruling class hopes, not exceed the scope of seeking peace. However, more and more American people are increasingly recognizing that the Johnson government is the chief culprit of the Vietnam War. It is not only the enemy of the Vietnamese people but also the enemy of the American people. The interests of the American people and the Vietnamese people are the same. They must resolutely stand with the Vietnamese people and direct the spearhead of the struggle against the sinister Johnson government. In the recent Washington demonstration, the crowd shouted, "Johnson is the enemy," which is not only a powerful denunciation of American imperialism but also a resounding slap in the face of those who are eager to serve American imperialism, big and small.

Chairman Mao has long said, "The American people should rise up to resist the attacks of the American reactionaries. I believe they will do so." Now, more and more American people have risen up and joined the struggle against their own imperialism. American imperialism is already under attack from both inside and outside. We are firmly convinced that if the American people unite, and the American people and the people of all countries that are subjected to American aggression and threats unite and fight together, they will definitely be able to bury American imperialism completely!

    约翰逊政府是美国人民的死敌
    本报评论员
    最近，在美国华盛顿和其他二十几个城市，爆发了大规模的美国人民反对侵越战争的大示威。二十日开始，十多万示威群众从美国各地到达华盛顿，高举着“立即撤回军队！”“我们不去越南（打仗）！”“越南是越南人的！”等标语牌，包围了美国国防部，并同法西斯军警展开了英勇的搏斗。美国统治集团如临大敌，惊惶万状，赶紧从几千里外的加利福尼亚州等地调动大批军队、宪兵、警察，对示威群众进行镇压。这充分地暴露了美帝国主义害怕人民的纸老虎的本质。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“战争的性质决定政府和人民的关系，这是一个历史的原则。”美帝国主义在越南进行的是一场非正义的、侵略的战争。这场战争的侵略性质，决定了约翰逊政府不仅把自己置于同越南人民和全世界人民为敌的地位，而且加深了它同美国人民的对立。
    约翰逊政府为了进行和不断扩大侵越战争，步步加紧对美国人民的进攻，给美国广大人民带来日益严重的灾难。它不断增加侵越经费，这就迫使美国人民更加勒紧裤带。它不断往越南战场增兵，这就使得更多的美国人民家破人亡。因此，这场侵略战争，必然要遭到美国广大人民越来越强烈的抵制和反对。只要约翰逊政府继续坚持侵越战争，它同美国人民之间的矛盾就必然要日益加剧，美国人民反对侵越战争的浪潮就必然要更加迅猛地高涨起来。
    面对着广大人民日益高涨的反对侵越战争运动，美国统治集团怕得要死。约翰逊政府天天吹嘘美国的什么“民主”、“自由”。但是，人民示威运动一起来，约翰逊政府就吓得魂不附体，立即出动大批军警进行镇压，把“民主”、“自由”的遮羞布丢得一干二净。美帝国主义头子约翰逊甚至赤膊上阵，破口大骂美国人民的反侵越示威是“不负责任的暴力行为和无法无天的行为”。这就再一次暴露了约翰逊之流的狰狞面目。
    什么“无法无天”？约翰逊政府违背美国人民的意志，违反美国人民的利益，坚持进行侵越战争，而且用暴力镇压示威群众，美国人民怎么能够容忍？美国人民就是要起来反抗美国统治集团强迫他们当炮灰的“法”，就是要起来打翻美帝国主义压迫他们的“天”。美国人民就是要用革命的暴力来对付美国反动派的反革命暴力。让华盛顿老爷们的“法治”、“秩序”见鬼去吧！
    美国广大人民反对侵越战争的怒潮是指向美帝国主义的。现代修正主义竟然妄想把美国人民反对侵越战争运动引入“和平主义”的歧途。他们竭力模糊美帝国主义侵越战争的侵略性质，转移美国人民斗争的方向，使美国人民的反对侵越战争运动象美国统治集团所希望的那样，不超越祈求和平的范围。但是，越来越多的美国人民已经日益认识到，约翰逊政府是侵越战争的罪魁祸首，它不仅是越南人民的死敌，也是美国人民的死敌；美国人民同越南人民的利益是一致的，他们一定要坚决同越南人民站在一起，把斗争的矛头指向罪恶滔天的约翰逊政府。在最近华盛顿的这次示威中，群众发出了“约翰逊才是敌人”的吼声，这不仅是对美帝国主义的有力声讨，同时也是给了那些竭力为美帝国主义效劳的大小帮凶们一记响亮的耳光。
    毛主席早就说过：“美国人民应当起来抵抗美国反动派的进攻。我相信他们是会这样做的。”现在，越来越多的美国人民已经纷纷起来，参加到反对本国帝国主义斗争的行列。美帝国主义已处在内外夹攻之中。我们坚信，美国人民团结起来，美国人民和一切受到美国侵略和威胁的国家的人民团结起来，共同战斗，就一定能够把美帝国主义彻底埋葬！
