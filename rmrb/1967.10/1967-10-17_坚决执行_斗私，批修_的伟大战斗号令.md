Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao's speech at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a very important speech. This speech first provides a basic assessment of the fundamental situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and more. This is a very profound and scientific analysis made by Vice Chairman Lin Biao based on Chairman Mao's consistent teachings. It highly summarizes the situation and essence of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads over the past year and more.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao's speech correctly and deeply proposes our current task of struggle: resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions to criticize self and oppose revisionism. Criticizing self and opposing revisionism are closely linked and cannot be separated. Only by thoroughly criticizing self can we more smoothly, more deeply, and more thoroughly oppose revisionism. The issue of criticizing self is a long-term political task for the entire socialist revolutionary period. This "self" is a product of thousands of years of private ownership society. The so-called "if one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth," and the "eat a small loss, gain a big advantage" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev are typical examples of "self," typical egoism and individualism. The ideological root of revisionism is this "self." What does revisionism do? It restores capitalism, promotes private ownership, internally restores capitalism, externally promotes great-power chauvinism and capitulationism, opposes world revolution, opposes internationalism, and does not want communism. Therefore, if the "self" is not resolved, if it is not constantly, long-term, and thoroughly criticized, if it is not overthrown and exposed, the root of revisionism cannot be eliminated. Even if old revisionism is overthrown, new revisionism will emerge. We support the world revolution, we must promote the establishment of public ownership worldwide, and build a society where there is no exploitation or oppression of one person by another. We must carry out a great revolution in our minds to break with the past and establish a new public spirit. While transforming the objective world, we must also transform the subjective world. We must seize two powers: seize the power of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and also seize the power of the "self" in our own minds; overthrow others, and also overthrow ourselves. Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution must also overthrow ourselves. If we do not overthrow ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." Therefore, this Cultural Revolution, if we do not criticize self and oppose revisionism, it will not be reliable. Even if old revisionism is overthrown, new revisionism will still appear, and there will still be the danger of capitalist restoration. Especially as the movement develops to the current stage, the issue of criticizing self becomes more and more important and prominent. What is it that has disrupted the great direction set by Chairman Mao? Apart from the sabotage by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and spies, within the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat, it is the "self" that comes first. This "self" coming first is concentrated in the issue of "power." To struggle for power, factions are formed, and factional struggles are used to replace this serious political and ideological struggle. Factionalism replaces party spirit. In this way, the great unity of the revolution cannot be well achieved, the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution cannot be smoothly implemented, the great criticism of the revolution cannot be well carried out, and the revolution cannot be well promoted and production cannot be well advanced.

Currently, the issue of "self" must be well resolved. We must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions of "criticize self, oppose revisionism" as the guideline to lead the entire Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Thoroughly criticizing "self" is precisely to better, resolutely, and thoroughly oppose revisionism.

To carry out Chairman Mao's great call of "criticize self, oppose revisionism," several issues must be resolved:

First, we must establish Chairman Mao's works study classes and training classes to further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The Guizhou Revolutionary Committee has made a decision that all places with conditions should establish them. The conditions are: places where the leftists are in power can establish them. The province can establish them, the prefecture can establish them, the county can establish them, and each unit can establish them. The Revolutionary Committee can establish them, and revolutionary mass organizations can also establish them. This training class and study class adopts a short-term rotation method. The problem to be solved is concentrated on breaking with the past and establishing a new public spirit, through studying Chairman Mao's works and conducting criticism and self-criticism, so as to achieve good results. The revolutionary faction solving the issue of "self" mainly solves the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the direction of struggle; another issue is the issue of "power." The form of concentrated training of cadres can be a three-in-one combination, with old cadres, new cadres, and Red Guards revolutionary youngsters studying together. After a period of time, the experience of generally establishing study classes can be summarized.

Second, we must carry out the great criticism of the revolution to the end, and we will not stop until the goal is achieved. Regarding the great criticism of the revolution, the situation is good. Currently, we must further improve the level of struggle in the great criticism of the revolution. First, we must improve the awareness and consciousness of the broad masses about the great criticism of the revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a serious political struggle, a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. It is not only necessary to solve the problem of seizing power in terms of organization, but also to thoroughly overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in terms of politics, ideology, and theory. Otherwise, even if the organizational problem is solved, the power will not be consolidated. The Cultural Revolution is not a movement to remove officials, but a great political and ideological revolution. Now, in Guizhou, the organizational problem has been basically solved, and there is even more reason, more conditions, and more necessity to grasp the great criticism movement. This is Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and we must keep up with it. Next, we must more broadly and deeply mobilize the masses. Currently, the development of the movement is not balanced, the countryside is slightly worse than the city, and some departments and units are slightly worse than the grassroots level, and it has not been done to mobilize everyone except the enemy to participate in this great criticism movement. Then, the leadership of the great criticism of the revolution must be strengthened. Good experiences of grassroots units should be discovered, promoted, and popularized, and the great criticism of the revolution and the study and application of Chairman Mao's works should be well unified and combined. In the struggle, learn in the struggle, use in the struggle, and use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize self and use Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism.

Third, regarding the great unity of the revolution. The entire province has made great progress on the original basis, and the mainstream is good, which should be affirmed. However, there have been some incorrect statements recently. Some say that the great unity does not need to distinguish between the left, middle, and right, which is wrong. The left, middle, and right are objectively existing, especially the Cultural Revolution, which is to make the class line clear, whether you stand on Chairman Mao's side or on the side of the Chinese Khrushchev, it must be clarified. Some set targets and percentages, which is wrong and has great dangers, easily confusing the class line, and there is a danger of becoming a big mess.

The great unity of the revolution is the great unity of revolutionary mass organizations under the principle of revolution. The great unity of the revolution, first of all, is the revolution. Separated from the principle of revolution, talking about the great unity will lead to the wrong path and will make mistakes. The key to the great unity of the revolution is the revolution, which is to carry out the great unity on the basis of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to consolidate and develop on this basis.

Fourth, regarding the good implementation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which points out that regarding the cadre issue, "in general situations, the first two kinds of people (good, relatively good) are the majority." Currently, it is a very good time to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Through the great criticism of the revolution, let the cadres come out and gain the understanding of the masses, gradually release the cadres, correctly use the cadres, and achieve the unification of the two 95% through the movement, resolutely implement the correct policy of "strike a small number, release a large area."

Fifth, regarding the promotion of revolution and production. We must resolutely achieve both high yield and high harvest. Industrial production must overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks.

Sixth, we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to launch the "support the army and love the people" movement, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. This requires correctly handling the two types of contradictions. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must maintain a high degree of vigilance in all work departments, be good at distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, and drive them out of our various fronts to safeguard our already achieved and future great victories."

Vice Chairman Lin's speech mentions that we must criticize self and oppose revisionism, which is Chairman Mao's latest battle call to the people of the entire country. We must act immediately and resolutely carry it out. We must push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, study to a new level, and use to a new level, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in every inch of Guizhou's land, and turn Guizhou into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　坚决执行“斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号令
　　贵州省革命委员会主任委员　李再含
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上的讲话，是非常重要的讲话。这个讲话，首先对一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命的基本形势作了基本估价。这是林彪副主席根据毛主席的一贯教导所作的非常精辟的科学分析。它高度概括了一年多来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的情况和实质。
    林彪副主席的讲话，正确地、深刻地提出了我们当前斗争的任务：坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，要斗私，批修。斗私，批修，二者是紧密联系着的，不能割裂开来。只有很好地斗私，才能更顺利地、更深入地、更彻底地批修。斗私的问题是整个社会主义革命时期长远的政治任务。这个“私”字是几千年来私有制社会的产物。那种所谓“人不为己，天诛地灭”，以及中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“吃小亏，占大便宜”，就是典型的“私”，典型的利己主义、个人主义。修正主义的思想根源，就是一个“私”字。修正主义搞什么呢？搞复辟资本主义，搞私有制，它对内复辟资本主义，对外搞大国沙文主义、投降主义，反对世界革命，反对国际主义，不要共产主义。所以，
  “私”字不解决，不经常地斗、长期地斗、彻底地斗，把它斗倒、斗臭，修正主义的根子就不能铲除。老修正主义打倒了，还会产生新的修正主义。我们支持世界革命，要推动全世界建立公有制，建立一个没有人剥削人、人压迫人的社会，必须在思想上破私立公，来一个大革命。在改造客观世界的同时，要改造主观世界。要夺两个权，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，也要夺自己头脑中“私”字的权；革人家的命，也要革自己的命。林彪副主席说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”所以，这场文化大革命，不斗私，批修是靠不住的，打倒了老的修正主义，还会出现新的修正主义，还有资本主义复辟的危险性，特别是运动发展到现阶段，斗私的问题愈来愈重要，愈来愈突出了。是什么东西扰乱了毛主席所规定的、指引的大方向呢？除了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地富反坏右、敌特的破坏以外，在无产阶级革命派内部来说，就是“私”字当头。这个“私”字当头，集中地表现在一个“权”字上。为争权就搞“派”，用派别斗争来代替这场严肃的政治斗争、思想斗争。派性代替了党性。这样，革命的大联合不能很好地搞起来，革命的“三结合”不能顺利实现，革命的大批判不能很好地开展，抓革命，促生产也不能很好地进行。
    当前，“私”字一定要很好地解决。我们要以毛主席的最新指示“斗私，批修”为纲，来统帅整个无产阶级文化大革命。狠斗“私”字，正是为了更好地批修、坚决地批修、彻底地批修。
    要贯彻毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号令，必须解决几个问题：
    一、要大办毛主席著作学习班、训练班，进一步推动活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。贵州省革委会已作了决定，凡是有条件的地方都要办。条件是：确定是左派掌权的地方就可以办，省里可以办，专区可以办，县里可以办，每个单位都可以办；革委会可以办，革命的群众组织也可以办。这个训练班、学习班，采取短期轮训办法，要解决的问题集中在破私立公上，通过学习毛主席著作，进行批评与自我批评，这样就能够收到良好的效果。革命派解决一个“私”字的问题，主要是解决对毛主席的指示、毛主席的革命路线、斗争大方向的态度问题；另外，解决一个“权”字的问题。集训干部的形式，可以搞三结合，老干部、新干部和红卫兵革命小将，在一起学。搞一段时间可以总结普遍办学习班的经验。
    二、要把革命的大批判进行到底，不达目的决不收兵。关于革命大批判，形势是好的。当前还要进一步提高革命大批判的斗争水平。首先，要提高广大群众对革命大批判的认识和觉悟。无产阶级文化大革命是一场严肃的政治斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，不仅要解决组织上夺权的问题，而且要从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底斗倒斗臭。否则，组织问题解决了，政权也是巩固不住的。文化大革命不是罢官运动，是政治思想大革命。现在贵州在组织问题上已基本解决，更有理由、更有条件、更有必要抓好大批判运动。这是毛主席的战略部署，我们一定要紧紧跟上。其次，要更广泛、更深入地发动群众。目前，运动发展不是那么平衡，农村比城市要差一点，某些机关、部门比基层差一点，还没有做到除了敌人外把每个人都发动起来，都来参加这场大批判运动。再次，革命大批判的领导要加强。发现基层单位好的经验，要加以推广、普及，把革命大批判和活学活用毛主席著作很好地统一起来，结合起来。在斗争中学，在斗争中用，用毛泽东思想来斗私，用毛泽东思想来批修。
    三、关于革命的大联合。全省在原有基础上已有很大的发展，主流是好的，应该加以肯定。但在最近有些不正确的说法。有的说，大联合不需分左、中、右了，这种说法是错误的。左、中、右是客观存在，特别是文化大革命，就是要阶级阵容分明，你是站在毛主席这一边，还是站在中国赫鲁晓夫那一边，必须搞清楚。有的提指标，搞百分比，这是不对的，有很大的危险性，容易混淆阶级阵线，有出现大杂烩的危险。
    革命大联合，是在革命的原则下革命群众组织的大联合。革命的大联合，首先是革命二字。离开革命原则，谈大联合，就要往邪路上走，就要犯错误。革命大联合，关键是革命二字，是在坚决贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的基础上搞大联合，在这个基础上巩固发展。
    四、关于搞好革命的“三结合”。毛主席亲自主持制订的“十六条”中指出，关于干部问题，“在一般情况下，前两种人（好的，比较好的）是大多数。”当前是搞好革命“三结合”的非常好的时机。通过革命大批判，让干部出来亮相，取得群众谅解，逐步解放干部，正确使用干部，经过运动达到团结两个百分之九十五，坚决执行“打击一小撮，解放一大片”的正确方针。
    五、关于抓革命，促生产。要坚决做到既丰产，又丰收。工业生产要超额完成今年的生产建设任务。
    六、坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，开展“拥军爱民”运动，加强无产阶级专政，巩固无产阶级专政。这就要求正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，我们一定要按照毛主席的教导：“必须在各个工作部门中保持高度的警惕性，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，把他们从我们的各个战线上清洗出去，这样来保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大的胜利。”
    林副主席讲话中讲的要斗私，批修，是毛主席向全国人民发出的最新战斗号令，我们要闻风而起，坚决照办。我们一定要把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向更新的阶段，学出新水平，用出新水平，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍贵州的每一寸土地，把贵州办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
