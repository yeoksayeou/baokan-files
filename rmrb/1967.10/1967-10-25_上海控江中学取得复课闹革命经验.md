The revolutionary little generals and broad revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai Kuojiang Middle School, in the process of resuming classes and making revolution, have been conducting revolutionary criticism while carrying out investigations and exploring teaching reforms, and have already gained some preliminary experience.

Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army Military and Political Training Team, the red guards and revolutionary teachers and students of this school have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's "March 7th" directive. In March of this year, they achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes and implemented revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and resumed classes while making revolution. Over the past few months, this school's revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit have been carried out vigorously.

The practice of Kuojiang Middle School over the past few months has proven that resuming classes and making revolution first and foremost means giving good lessons on Mao Zedong Thought, on class struggle, and on the Cultural Revolution. Resuming classes and making revolution should take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, continuously deepen the revolutionary criticism, and promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. They believe that reforming the old educational system, teaching policies, and methods is a very important task of the proletarian cultural revolution. In this educational revolution, we must thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line and its poison in our school, reform the old educational system, teaching policies, and methods; clarify what is revisionism and what is socialism in educational issues; what is the line of the Chinese Khrushchev and what is in line with Mao Zedong Thought. In the process of reform, we must thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary youngsters of Kuojiang Middle School in Shanghai, in carrying out the educational revolution, have grasped the key issues of their school, severely criticized the revisionist educational line, and closely linked the criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their unit.

Kuojiang Middle School was established after liberation under the care of the Party to cultivate the children of workers. Chairman Mao said: "Our educational policy must enable those who receive an education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become workers with socialist consciousness and culture." "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." However, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party have completely deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and educational policy, turning Kuojiang Middle School into a "key school" for promoting the revisionist educational line, advocating intelligence first, admission first, scores first, separating from politics, separating from workers and peasants, separating from productive labor, and attempting to cultivate workers' and peasants' children into spiritual aristocrats who deviate from the interests of their own class.

In exposing and criticizing the revisionist educational line and the old educational system, the revolutionary youngsters linked it with the actual situation of their school, focusing on criticizing the "fast class" as a typical example, deeply exposing the evil of the so-called "fast class" advocating "excellence," "teaching according to aptitude," promoting "free competition" in professional skills, deliberately cultivating "elite" students, and guiding students to strive individually. At the same time, they exposed many issues such as the "key class" and the one-sided pursuit of admission rates. All these exposed the reactionary essence of the revisionist educational line in cultivating successors of the bourgeoisie.

They also focused on the issue of "power" and "who runs the school," carrying out exposure and criticism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." He also said: "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The revolutionary teachers and students of Kuojiang Middle School, using Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive as a weapon, analyzed the serious problem of "whose heaven is it" in the old Kuojiang over the past decade or so, exposing the fact that under the rule of the revisionist educational black line promoted by a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, the old Kuojiang heavily relied on some so-called "professionally skilled and experienced" bourgeois intellectuals, praising them as "old hens" and "pillars," and the school leadership was actually in the hands of these people. Through in-depth criticism, the revolutionary teachers and students increasingly deeply realized that "the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." They are determined to thoroughly criticize and establish in the educational revolution, thoroughly eliminate the revisionist educational black line, thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school, and turn the school into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

They adopted the following methods to combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their unit: (1) Comparative analysis. That is, comparing Chairman Mao's instructions with the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, with the various problems existing in the school, and with the ideological understanding of revolutionary teachers and students, and conducting comparative analysis. Those revisionist goods that violate Chairman Mao's teachings are thoroughly exposed and mercilessly criticized, exposing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev on the educational front, seeing through the essence of the various problems existing in the school, and finding the root of the problems. In the process of comparative analysis, revolutionary teachers and students studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. (2) Investigation and research. In the process of criticizing the revisionist educational line, they paid more attention to investigation and research, dissecting the "bitter gourd" and tracing the root. Through investigation, the broad masses of teachers and students saw more clearly how long the black hand of the Chinese Khrushchev had reached and how malicious his intention to restore capitalism was! (3) Revolutionary teachers and students held denunciation meetings together, denouncing the harm of the revisionist educational line to themselves, concentrating the greatest hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev; at the same time, touching their souls, eliminating its influence, and greatly promoting ideological revolutionization.

While criticizing the revisionist educational line, the revolutionary teachers and students, with Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive as their goal, practiced and explored as pioneers of the educational revolution. Some classes adopted the method of teachers and students preparing and teaching lessons together, teaching while criticizing and reforming, exploring new teaching methods; some classes actively applied Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, while criticizing the revisionist educational system, made overall arrangements for studying literature, working, farming, and military affairs, and carried out practice. They also organized educational revolution investigation teams, going deep into factories, rural areas, military units, shops, and primary and secondary schools to widely solicit opinions, so as to gradually propose revolutionary plans for teaching systems and teaching content.

The revolutionary youngsters of Kuojiang Middle School attach great importance to giving full play to the enthusiasm of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers. They criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small area" in the cadre issue, liberating cadres and teachers from the fear. Many little red guards also went to visit teachers' families. At the same time, revolutionary teachers also fought against selfishness, established the spirit of daring, accepted the help of revolutionary youngsters, and together with the revolutionary youngsters held criticism meetings, angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line; together formed teaching reform groups, investigation groups, and criticism groups, jointly studied teaching reform, and jointly conducted investigations and research. Many revolutionary teachers, in the great criticism and great struggle, in the process of resuming classes and making revolution, bravely shouldered the responsibility and played an active role.

The practice of the past few months has made the youngsters deeply realize that in the educational revolution, we must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to practice and create, daring to think and speak, daring to venture and do, so as to continuously summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress, establishing the newest educational system of the proletariat. Recently, the revolutionary teachers and students of Kuojiang Middle School have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying and applying the "Old Three Articles," and the school has seen a new high tide of a broader and deeper educational revolution.

    上好毛泽东思想课　上好阶级斗争课　上好文化大革命课
    上海控江中学取得复课闹革命经验
    联系本校实际，狠揭狠批修正主义教育路线，师生紧密结合探索新的教学途径
    据新华社上海二十四日电　上海市控江中学红卫兵小将和广大革命师生在复课闹革命中，一面开展革命大批判，一面进行调查研究和教学改革的探索，已经取得了一些初步经验。
    这所学校的红卫兵小将和革命师生，在人民解放军军政训练团的帮助下，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“三·七”指示，今年三月就实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，并实现了革命的“三结合”和复课闹革命。几个月来，这个学校的革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改始终搞得热气腾腾。
    控江中学几个月来的实践证明，复课闹革命，首先是上好毛泽东思想的课，上好阶级斗争的课，上好文化大革命的课。复课闹革命要以“斗私，批修”为纲，不断深入地开展革命的大批判，推进本单位的斗批改。他们认为，改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法，是无产阶级文化大革命一个极其重要的任务。在这场教育革命中，我们就是要彻底批判修正主义教育路线及其在本校的流毒，改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法；要弄清在教育问题上什么是修正主义，什么是社会主义；什么是中国赫鲁晓夫那一套，什么是符合毛泽东思想的。要在改革的过程中大破修正主义教育路线，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    上海市控江中学的革命小将们在进行教育革命时，抓住本校的要害问题，狠狠批判了修正主义的教育路线，把大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。
    控江中学是解放后在党的关怀下，为了培养工人子弟建立起来的。毛主席说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合。”但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派完全背离了毛主席的革命路线和教育方针，把控江中学作为推行修正主义教育路线的一所“重点中学”，竭力提倡智育第一，升学第一，分数第一，脱离政治，脱离工农，脱离生产劳动，企图把工农子弟培养成为背离本阶级利益的资产阶级的精神贵族。
    革命小将们在揭发和批判修正主义教育路线和旧的教育制度时，联系本校实际，抓住了“快班”这个典型进行批判，深刻地揭露了所谓“快班”鼓吹“拔尖”“因材施教”、宣扬在业务上“自由竞赛”、对“尖子”着意培养、引导学生个人奋斗的罪恶。同时，还揭露了搞“重点班”、片面追求升学率等许多问题。这些，都有力地揭露了修正主义教育路线培养资产阶级继承人的反动实质。
    他们还抓住“权”的问题、“靠谁办学”的问题，开展了揭发、批判。毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”又说：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”控江中学革命师生以毛主席的“五·七”指示为武器，剖析了旧控江十几年来“究竟是谁家天下”的严重问题，揭露了在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的修正主义教育黑线统治下的旧控江，重用一些所谓“有业务专长和教学经验”的资产阶级知识分子，吹嘘他们是“老母鸡”、“台柱”，学校领导权实际上被这些人所把持的事实，经过深入的批判，革命师生越来越深刻地认识到“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”。他们决心在教育革命中大破大立，彻底铲除修正主义教育黑线，彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    他们采取了以下几种方法，把革命大批判和本单位斗批改结合起来：（一）对照分析。即：用毛主席的指示同中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的反革命修正主义的谬论，同学校所存在的种种问题，同革命师生的思想认识，加以对照分析。对那些违背毛主席教导的修正主义货色，予以彻底揭露，无情批判，戳穿中国赫鲁晓夫在教育战线上所犯的滔天罪行，看清本校存在的种种问题的实质，找到问题的症结。在对照分析中，革命师生活学活用毛主席著作，树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。（二）调查研究。在批判修正主义教育路线的过程中，他们比较重视调查研究，解剖“苦瓜”，顺藤挖根。经过调查，广大师生更加看清了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑手伸得多么长，其复辟资本主义的用心又多么恶毒！（三）革命师生一起开控诉会，控诉修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，把最大的仇恨凝聚到中国赫鲁晓夫身上；同时，触及自己的灵魂，清除它的影响，大大促进思想革命化。
    革命师生们在批判修正主义教育路线的同时，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为奋斗目标，边实践，边探索，当教育革命的闯将。有些班级采取师生结合备课、上课，边教边批边改的方法，摸索新的教学途径；有的班级活学活用毛主席的“五·七”指示，一边批判修正主义教育制度，一边作出学文、学工、学农、学军的全面安排，进行实践。他们还组织了教育革命调查组，深入到工厂、农村、部队、商店以及大中小学，广泛听取意见，以便逐步提出教学制度和教学内容的革命方案。
    控江中学的革命小将，十分重视发挥广大革命干部、革命教师的积极性。他们批判了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把干部和教师从“怕”字中解放了出来。许多红卫兵小将还纷纷到教师家庭中去进行访问。同时，革命教师也狠斗“私”字，树立“敢”字，接受革命小将的帮助，和革命小将一起开批判会，愤怒声讨资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行；一起组成教学改革小组、调查小组和批判小组，共同研究教学改革，一起调查研究。许多革命教师在大批判、大斗争中，在复课闹革命中，勇敢地挑起重担，发挥了主动性积极性。
    几个月来的实践使小将们深深体会到：在教育革命中，一定要发扬勇于实践、敢于创造的革命精神，敢想敢说，敢闯敢干，这样才能不断总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，创立无产阶级的最新的教育体系。最近，控江中学革命师生响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用“老三篇”，学校里出现了一个更广泛、更深入的教育革命的新高潮。
