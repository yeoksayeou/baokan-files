The Indian reactionaries will meet a bad end for invading China!

The Indian side again comes to claim the bodies and weapons of Indian soldiers killed while invading our territory

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 4th - At around 12:00 today, the Indian side, following the notification of the People's Liberation Army's Tibet Border Defense Forces, once again came to the Chinese territory to claim the bodies of five Indian soldiers, one light machine gun, one submachine gun, seven semi-automatic rifles, and some ammunition left behind after they were killed while invading our territory on October 1st through the Zola Pass on the China-Sikkim border. When the Indian representatives, including S.S. Bhambei and five others, carrying a Red Cross flag, arrived at the designated location, our representatives sternly rebuked and warned them, "The People's Liberation Army is armed with Mao Zedong Thought and is not to be trifled with. The Indian reactionaries will meet a bad end for invading China." The Indian representatives nodded repeatedly in response, saying, "Yes, we suffered a shameful defeat."

Following this, S.S. Bhambei checked each body, weapon, and ammunition item by item and signed the inventory list written in both Chinese and Indian languages, which stated: "The bodies and military supplies left behind by the Indian Army on October 1, 1967, when they invaded Chinese territory through the Zola Pass."

At 12:43, the Indian personnel carried the bodies of the Indian soldiers and the weapons and ammunition away in disgrace.

The Indian reactionaries, relying on military provocations to curry favor with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, after launching an armed attack on us on September 11th, again drove the Indian invading army to cross the China-Sikkim border at the Zola Pass into Chinese territory on the morning of October 1st, provoking our border guards with armed aggression. Under the cover of heavy artillery fire, they launched an attack on our border defense forces. Our border defense forces were forced to defend themselves and once again gave the Indian invading army a powerful blow. The Indian invading army left behind many bodies and fled in disarray.

    印度反动派侵略中国绝没有好下场！
    印方再次前来认领入侵我境被击毙的印军尸体和武器
    新华社拉萨四日电　今天十二时许，印方按照我人民解放军西藏边防部队的通知，再次来到中国境内，认领在十月一日越过中锡边界卓拉山口对我进行军事挑衅时，被我边防部队击毙遗弃在中国境内的印军尸体五具、轻机枪一挺、冲锋枪一支、半自动步枪七支和弹药一部。当印方代表斯·斯·班贝伊等六人打着红十字会旗子，来到我方指定地点时，我方代表当面斥责并警告说：“中国人民解放军是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，是不好惹的。印度反动派侵略中国绝没有好下场。”印方代表连连点头回答：“是，遭到了可耻失败。”
    接着，斯·斯·班贝伊一一清点了尸体、武器和弹药，并在用中印两国文字注明：“在一九六七年十月一日，印度军队在卓拉山口越入中国境内进行挑衅时遗弃在中国境内的尸体及军用物资”的清单上签字认领。
    十二时四十三分，印方人员抬着印军尸体和枪支弹药灰溜溜的退出我境。
    依靠军事挑衅来向美帝、苏修讨好乞援的印度反动派，继九月十一日向我发动武装进攻后，十月一日上午，又驱使印度侵略军越过中锡边界卓拉山口进入中国境内，向我边防执勤人员进行武装挑衅，并在猛烈炮火掩护下，向我边防部队发动进攻。我边防部队被迫自卫，再一次给印度侵略军以有力的回击。印度侵略军丢下尸体多具，狼狈逃回。（附图片）
