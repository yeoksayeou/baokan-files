Under the rule of the modern revisionist clique, the laboring people of the Eastern European countries express their deepest feelings and love for the reddest red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. They praise Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the teacher and leader of the world's revolutionary people, and enthusiastically applaud the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

Long live Chairman Mao!

On the eve of our National Day, a Bulgarian woman, in order to express her congratulations to the Chinese people and her boundless love for Chairman Mao, personally embroidered a fine tablecloth and handed it to Chinese comrades to be personally presented to Chairman Mao.

The woman also wrote a fervent letter to Chairman Mao. The letter said: "Comrade Mao Zedong, we warmly accept your thoughts. No force can stop our love for you, the great leader of the proletariat, because Comrade Mao Zedong, you are our teacher and leader." The letter said: "We, the Bulgarian people, are deeply impressed by the great achievements made in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under your wise leadership. We firmly believe that the great Chinese people will achieve even greater victories, and this will also be our victory."

The letter concluded: "Comrade Mao Zedong, please allow me, on behalf of some comrades and myself, to sincerely wish you a long life! Long live!"

Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time

A Bulgarian friend, in a letter to Chairman Mao, enthusiastically praised the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao. The letter said: "The revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong and the seven hundred million Chinese people has great world significance," "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest genius of our time, a true Marxist-Leninist revolutionary." The letter also said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has frightened the enemy, because this is the greatest misfortune for them. Our friends and our enemies are all clear that the revolution taking place in China will promote the revolutionization of the proletariat and national liberation movements around the world. The mass fighting force will overthrow imperialism and all reactionary regimes."

Chairman Mao points the way for revolutionaries

On the 18th anniversary of our National Day, a young worker in the German Democratic Republic who studies Chairman Mao's works every day told Chinese comrades: "The Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, have achieved brilliant achievements in politics, economy, and science in just eighteen years, and I feel very proud of this."

"The Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese people and also the leader of the world's revolutionary people, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. At present, to judge whether a person is a true Communist or whether a party is a true Communist party, one must see whether they study Mao Zedong Thought and apply Mao Zedong Thought." The young worker said: "I deeply admire and love Chairman Mao because he points the way for the world's proletarian revolutionaries."

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is very good. After the working class seizes power, it is necessary to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can the power of the working class be consolidated, and only then can the emergence of a new bourgeoisie and new exploiters be prevented. Chairman Mao's theory about the existence of classes and class struggle in a socialist society is very correct. Chairman Mao's saying that 'rebellion is justified' is very correct."

Following the path pointed out by Chairman Mao

Another young person from the German Democratic Republic told Chinese comrades: "Since the October Revolution, history has experienced a new peak: the People's Republic of China has become the world center of the greatest liberation movement of mankind and the strongest pillar of the international proletariat. Such a country, which is hated by imperialist-revisionists and loved by the world's proletarians, has become an example for the world's people."

He pointed out: "The people of the world are determined to 'follow the path pointed out by the Chinese people and the leader of the world's proletariat—Mao Zedong.'"

Mao Zedong, the Lenin of our time!

Many young people in Czechoslovakia, fearing no persecution, bravely wear Chairman Mao's badges on their chests or on their hats every day. Some students, even when threatened with expulsion for wearing the badges, remain fearless and refuse to take them off. Once, someone maliciously asked a student who was wearing a badge on his chest whose picture was on it. The student proudly replied: "Mao Zedong, the Lenin of our time!"

　　东欧国家劳动人民无限热爱世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳
　　毛主席是当代最伟大的马列主义者
    据新华社讯　在现代修正主义集团统治下的东欧国家的劳动人民以最真挚的感情，无限热爱全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。他们称颂毛主席是当代最伟大的马列主义者，是世界革命人民的导师和领袖；热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    在我国国庆节前夕，保加利亚一位妇女为了表示对中国人民的祝贺和对毛主席的无限热爱，亲手绣制了一块精致的台布，交给中国同志，要中国同志亲自转给毛主席。
    这位妇女同时给毛主席写了一封热情洋溢的信。信中写道：毛泽东同志，我们最热烈地接受您的思想，任何力量也不能阻止我们对您、对无产阶级伟大的领袖的热爱，因为毛泽东同志，您是我们的导师和领袖。信中说：我们，保加利亚人民对在您英明领导下进行的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的巨大成就极为赞佩。我们坚信，伟大的中国人民将取得更伟大的胜利，这也将是我们的胜利。
    信中最后写道：毛泽东同志，请允许我代表一些同志和我本人衷心地祝您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席是当代最伟大的天才
    一位保加利亚朋友在写给毛主席的一封贺信中热情赞扬世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席。信中说：“毛泽东同志领导的七亿中国人民进行的革命具有巨大的世界意义”，“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的天才，是真正的马克思列宁主义的革命家。”信中还说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命，吓坏了敌人，因为这对他们来说是最大的不幸。我们的朋友和我们的敌人都清楚，在中国进行的这场革命将促进全世界无产阶级的革命化和民族解放运动。群众性的战斗力量将要推翻帝国主义和一切反动统治”。
    毛主席给革命者指出斗争方向
    在我国国庆十八周年的时候，德意志民主共和国一位每天坚持毛主席著作学习的青年工人对中国同志说：“中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，仅短短十八年，在政治、经济和科学方面取得了辉煌成就，我对此感到非常骄傲。”
  “毛泽东主席是中国人民的领袖，也是世界革命人民的领袖，是当代最伟大的马列主义者。目前，衡量一个人是否是真正的共产党人，或者衡量一个政党是否是真正的共产党，那就要看他是否学习毛泽东思想，是否运用毛泽东思想。”这位青年说：“我无限敬仰和热爱毛主席，因为他给世界无产阶级革命者指出了斗争的方向。”
      “由毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命非常好。在工人阶级取得政权后，必须进行无产阶级文化大革命，只有通过无产阶级文化大革命才能巩固工人阶级的政权，才能防止产生新的资产阶级，新的剥削者。毛主席关于在社会主义社会中还存在阶级和阶级斗争的理论非常正确。毛主席说的‘造反有理’非常正确。”
    走毛主席指出的道路
    另一位德意志民主共和国青年对中国同志说：“自十月革命以来，历史上又经历了一个新的高峰：中华人民共和国已成为人类最伟大的解放运动的世界中心，是国际无产阶级最强有力的支柱。这样一个被帝修所恨，被世界无产者所爱的国家，已成为世界人民的榜样。”
    他指出：世界各国人民决心“走中国人民和世界无产者的领袖——毛泽东所指出的道路。”
    毛泽东，当代的列宁！
    捷克斯洛伐克的许多青年，不怕迫害，整天勇敢地把毛主席像章佩戴在胸前，或者别在帽子上。有些学生即使因戴像章而受到开除学籍的威胁，也毫不畏惧，依然佩戴，决不摘下。有一次，有人恶意地质问一个学生胸前的像章上是谁，那个学生骄傲地说：“毛泽东，当代的列宁！”
