Title: Where Should Apprentices Be Led?

Are we to use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate and train successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, or are we to use revisionism to “cultivate” apprentices? This is a major political issue. It is also a fundamental issue concerning whether our country will change its color in the future.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we need not only a correct line and policy, but also to cultivate and train millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.” However, China's Khrushchev and his clique do the opposite. As soon as apprentices enter the factory, they do not care about or educate them politically, but instead keep saying: “The power plant is so good, apprentices get allowances, clothing allowances, sick leave has labor insurance, and upon graduation, they can earn so much money…” They claim that the purpose of our apprentices entering the factory is for “money,” for “labor insurance.” This is sheer nonsense! We enter the factory to build socialism, to carry on the legacy of Mao Zedong Thought, to serve the people, and certainly not for a few dollars or to grab some benefits. China's Khrushchev attempts to use money and benefits as bait to lead our youth astray, turning them into his “tame tools” for restoring capitalism. This is a futile attempt! We apprentices must wield the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, take up our pens as weapons, and criticize China's Khrushchev, exposing his true colors and ensuring he never rises again!

    把艺徒引向何处？
    是用毛泽东思想来培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人，还是用修正主义一套来“培养”艺徒？这是一个重大的政治问题，也是关系到我们国家今后会不会改变颜色的大是大非问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”而中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙却反其道而行之。艺徒一进厂，他们首先不是从政治思想上来关心、教育艺徒，而是口口声声讲：“发电厂如何如何好，艺徒有津贴费、服装费，生病有劳保，满师能拿到多少多少钱……。”把我们艺徒进厂的目的说成就是为了“钞票”，为了“劳保”。真是一派胡言！我们进厂是为了建设社会主义，是为了接好毛泽东思想的班，是为人民服务，决不是为了几个钱，捞个什么福利。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用金钱、福利作诱饵，把我们青年引上歧途，变为他复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”，这是痴心妄想！我们艺徒一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，拿起笔作刀枪，把中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒、批臭，叫他永世不得翻身！
