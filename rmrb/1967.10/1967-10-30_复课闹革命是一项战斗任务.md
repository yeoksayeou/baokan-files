Resuming classes and making revolution is a combat mission.

In the great situation where the Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat has achieved decisive victories, the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao has issued a combat mission to revolutionary teachers and students: immediately resume classes and make revolution.

This is necessary to consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances, to liberate cadres and implement revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations, to further carry out revolutionary great criticism, and to conduct struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit or school. In short, it is necessary for the revolution, for better studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and for thoroughly carrying out the great line of "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" to push the Cultural Revolution to the end.

We have countless reasons to immediately resume classes and make revolution, and not a single reason not to do so. Some people say, "The revolutionary tasks are so heavy now, it's too early to resume classes." Others say, "The educational black line has not been thoroughly exposed and criticized, isn't resuming classes a restoration of the old order?" Can these be reasons not to resume classes? No!

The decisive victories of the Cultural Revolution and the unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation have prepared sufficient conditions for schools to immediately resume classes.

Are the revolutionary tasks heavy? Then it is even more necessary to immediately resume classes and make revolution. The various revolutionary tasks of the school depend on the broad revolutionary teachers and students to complete. Resuming classes and making revolution will better mobilize and organize broad revolutionary teachers and students to return to school, pool their strengths, and accelerate the revolutionary process, completing the school's various revolutionary tasks even better.

Is resuming classes a restoration of the old order? No! Resuming classes is to better criticize the educational black line and better carry out educational revolution. Chairman Mao said: "No matter who wants to understand a certain matter, besides coming into contact with that matter, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that matter, there is no other way to solve it." The revolution in education can only be carried out in conjunction with teaching practice; there is no other way.

### 复课闹革命是一项战斗任务

    复课闹革命是一项战斗任务
    立即开学，复课闹革命，这是在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部向革命师生提出的一项战斗任务。
    这样做，是巩固和发展革命大联合的需要，是解放干部和实行革命“三结合”的需要，是进一步开展革命大批判的需要，是进行本单位、本学校斗批改的需要。一句话，是革命的需要，是更好地活学活用毛主席著作，切实贯彻执行“斗私，批修”的伟大方针，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的需要。
    我们有千条万条理由立即开学，复课闹革命，没有一条理由不这样做。有人说：“现在革命任务这么重，开学还太早。”又有人说：“教育黑线还没有很好地挖很好地批，现在开学不是恢复旧秩序了吗？”这些难道能成为不开学的理由吗？不能！
    无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，空前大好的革命形势，为学校立即开学准备了充足的条件。
    革命任务重吗？就更应该立即开学，复课闹革命。学校的各项革命任务，要依靠学校的广大革命师生去完成。复课闹革命，就更有利于动员、组织广大革命师生，全部返回学校，群策群力，加速推进革命的进程，把学校的各项革命任务完成得更好。
    开学是不是就恢复了旧秩序？不！开学是为了更好地批判教育黑线，更好地进行教育革命。毛主席说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”教育的革命，只有结合教学的实践去进行，舍此是没有别的办法的。（浙江日报十月二十一日社论）
