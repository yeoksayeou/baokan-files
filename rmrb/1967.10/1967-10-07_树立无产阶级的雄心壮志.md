In the midst of the triumphant advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another heartening piece of news has come from the scientific and technological front in our country. A state-of-the-art transistorized large-scale general-purpose digital computer has been successfully developed and tested by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a major achievement in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's "grasp revolution, promote production," and a new height reached in the struggle of our people to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level of science and technology.

In the development of science and technology in our country, there has always been a sharp and intense struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois lines. The handful of capitalism-treading power-holders within the Party, with Liu Shaoqi as their representative, have emphasized the role of technology alone, worshipped bourgeois experts and "authorities," advocated material incentives, opposed the prominence of proletarian politics, opposed revolutionary mass movements, opposed the thought reform of people, and pursued a thorough line of slavishness, crawling, and abolitionism in the field of science and technology—a counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line has been defeated. The proletarian revolutionary forces on the scientific and technological front have, through the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation within their units, launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalism-treading power-holders within the Party. At the same time, they have further promoted their own thought reform. Over the past year, the series of new achievements we have made in science and technology have dealt Liu Shaoqi a heavy blow after another. The great spiritual force aroused by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has turned into a great material force driving the development of our national defense construction and industrial and agricultural production.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people have boundless creativity." The proletariat of the East is thousands of times more advanced than the bourgeoisie of the West. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we are striving hard and relying on our own efforts to blaze a new trail in the development of science and technology.

Chairman Mao also teaches us: "The correct ideas of the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, become a material force." The Chinese people, armed with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to tread paths that no one has ever trodden and dare to scale peaks that no one has ever scaled. Such a people can create all kinds of miracles on earth.

"Endless beauty lies in the perilous peaks."

All proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses throughout the country should learn from the revolutionary workers, technicians, and scientific workers who participated in the development of this state-of-the-art transistorized large-scale general-purpose digital computer. They should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish the great ambition of the proletariat, take "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, use the great criticism of the revolution and the struggle-criticism-transformation within their units as a driving force, and vigorously promote a new leap in industrial and agricultural production and science and technology.

    树立无产阶级的雄心壮志
　　·本报评论员·
    在无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的凯歌声中，我国科学技术战线上又传来了一个振奋人心的喜讯。一台最新型的晶体管大型通用数字计算机，在中国科学院研究试制成功了。
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命中“抓革命，促生产”的一个重大成果，是我国人民在赶超世界先进科学技术水平的斗争中达到的一个新的高度。
    在我国科学技术事业的发展中，一直存在着无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线尖锐、激烈的斗争。以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们单纯强调技术的作用，迷信资产阶级专家、“权威”，鼓吹物质刺激，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对革命的群众运动，反对人的思想革命化，在科学技术工作中推行了一条彻头彻尾的奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义的反革命修正主义路线。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫推行的这条反革命修正主义路线破产了。科技战线的无产阶级革命派，在革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改中，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动了猛烈的攻击，同时又进一步推动了自己的思想革命化。一年多来，我们在科学技术上所取得的一系列新的成就，给中国赫鲁晓夫一次又一次的沉重打击。无产阶级文化大革命激发起来的伟大精神力量，变成了推动我国的国防建设和工农业生产发展的伟大物质力量。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民群众有无限的创造力”。东方的无产阶级要比西方的资产阶级高明千百倍。我们在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，正在开创出一条科学技术发展的崭新道路。
    毛主席还教导我们：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，敢于走前人从来没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人从来没有攀登过的高峰。这样的人民，能够创造出一切人间的奇迹。
      “无限风光在险峰”。
    全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要向参加这台最新型的晶体管大型通用数字计算机研制工作的革命工人、技术人员和科学工作者学习，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树立无产阶级的雄心壮志，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把革命大批判和本单位斗批改作为动力，大力促进工农业生产和科学技术的新的飞跃发展。
