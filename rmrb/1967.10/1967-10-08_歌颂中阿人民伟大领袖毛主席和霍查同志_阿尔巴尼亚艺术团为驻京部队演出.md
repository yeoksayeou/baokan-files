The amateur art troupe "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun" from Tirana, Albania, which is on the frontline against imperialism and revisionism, performed a special show for the Beijing-based units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the evening of October 5 at the Great Hall of the People. Over ten thousand soldiers and officers from the army, navy, and air force welcomed them enthusiastically.

Vice Premier and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Yang Chengwu, and Vice Minister of National Defense Su Yu attended the performance.

When the performance began, the screen displayed the radiant portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha. The Albanian cultural warriors waved the flags of both countries, dancing passionately to the majestic tunes of "The Party of Labor - The Heroic Party" and "The East Is Red," singing praises to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. They enthusiastically sang praises to the proletarian internationalist friendship and combat unity between the two parties, the two countries, and the peoples of the two countries. The performance ended with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and shouts of "Mao Zedong - Enver!" and "Enver - Mao Zedong!" echoed both on and off the stage.

During the intermission, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Fuzhi, Yang Chengwu, and Su Yu met with the troupe leader Mu. Gerchali, deputy leader Ya. Toka, and some of the performers, engaging in cordial conversations. After the performance, Nie Rongzhen and other leaders went on stage to shake hands with the performers, congratulating them on their successful show.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the amateur art troupe "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun" from Tirana, Albania, visited the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune on October 6 and worked alongside the commune members.

During the break, the comrades from both China and Albania held a get-together. Songs filled the cotton fields, and shouts of "Enver - Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong - Enver" echoed endlessly over the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune.
