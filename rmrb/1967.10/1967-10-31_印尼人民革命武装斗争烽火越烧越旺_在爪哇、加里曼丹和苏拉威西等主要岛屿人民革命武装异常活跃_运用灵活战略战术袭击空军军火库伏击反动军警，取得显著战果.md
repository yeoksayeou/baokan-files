The fire of the Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle is burning more intensely. In major islands such as Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, the people's armed forces are exceptionally active. By employing flexible strategies and tactics, they have attacked air force armories and ambushed reactionary military and police forces, achieving remarkable results.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 30th, news from Jakarta indicates that the Indonesian people's armed struggle against the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution is continuing to develop in major islands such as Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi.

In the vast rural areas of West Kalimantan, a people's armed force has been frequently launching offensive operations against local reactionary troops in recent months. According to a report from the "Torch of the Poor" on August 23rd, the West Kalimantan people's armed forces, in the early hours of July 16th, attacked the military armory at the Sangkapura Air Force Base. Apart from killing four reactionary Indonesian soldiers on the spot, they also seized over a hundred guns, two mortars, and more than twenty boxes of various types of ammunition. The reactionary Indonesian troops guarding the base were thrown into disarray, with some jumping into wells in fear. According to a report from a Western news agency on August 17th, the West Kalimantan people's armed forces launched another ambush in mid-August, killing two reactionary soldiers. According to a report from the Antara News Agency, on August 24th, the people's armed forces ambushed a patrol squad of the reactionary Indonesian military in the Sangkulu area of the Three Rivers District. The enemy patrol squad was confused and "did not realize the direction from which the attack came." The Jakarta radio station revealed in a broadcast on October 2nd that a people's armed force attacked a squad of reactionary Indonesian military in the Tangar-Labo area of Sangkapura on October 1st, killing several enemy soldiers. According to a report from the Associated Press on October 18th, the West Kalimantan people's armed forces ambushed a patrol squad of the reactionary Indonesian military in the Sangkulu area, killing six reactionary soldiers and seizing some American-made rifles. According to a report from the Indonesian National Cooperation News Agency on October 20th, recently, the West Kalimantan people's armed forces ambushed a squad of reactionary Indonesian military recently transferred from Java near the Merabu Mountains in the Mengkayang area.

According to reports from reactionary Indonesian newspapers, the West Kalimantan people's armed forces have established guerrilla activity zones in Three Rivers, Seluwas, Tebas, and Sangkulu in West Kalimantan. The residents of this area have a long tradition of revolutionary struggle and have never been conquered by any imperialism or colonialism in the past 350 years. The people's armed forces in this area have carried out extensive guerrilla activities.

According to a report from the Antara News Agency, in East Kalimantan, a people's armed force ambushed reactionary Indonesian military and police in late August. According to reports, in Central Java, a people's armed force is continuing the struggle in the revolutionary-rich Merapi Mountain area. Western news agencies revealed that this people's armed force attacked a patrol squad of the reactionary Indonesian military in early September. They were mobile and flexible, striking and then retreating safely. The revolutionary people of the Probolinggo-Kediri area in East Java are also engaged in armed struggle activities. In North Sulawesi, recently, the people's armed forces fought a battle with the reactionary Indonesian military in the Lembeh Island area.

The rise of armed struggles by the people in various parts of Indonesia, especially the development of the armed struggle by the people of West Kalimantan, has caused great alarm to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. According to a report from the Antara News Agency on September 23rd, the reactionary military leaders in Kalimantan recently held a "special meeting" in Makassar to plot and scheme for the intensified suppression of the people's armed forces.

The armed struggle of the Indonesian revolutionary people will surely flourish. This is something that no reactionary forces can stop. No matter how the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime struggles desperately, it cannot escape the fate of being engulfed by the flames of the people's war.

    印尼人民革命武装斗争烽火越烧越旺
    在爪哇、加里曼丹和苏拉威西等主要岛屿人民革命武装异常活跃
    运用灵活战略战术袭击空军军火库伏击反动军警，取得显著战果
    据新华社三十日讯　雅加达消息：据报道，印度尼西亚人民反抗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权反动统治的革命武装斗争，正在爪哇、加里曼丹和苏拉威西等主要岛屿继续发展。
    在西加里曼丹的广大乡村，一支人民武装近几个月来经常主动出击，打击当地反动军队。据《贫民火炬报》八月二十三日报道，西加里曼丹人民武装，在七月十六日凌晨袭击了山口羊空军基地的军火库，除当场打死印尼反动军人四名外，还缴获枪支一百多支，迫击炮两门，各种类型的子弹二十多箱。守卫基地的印尼反动军队被打得不知所措，有的吓得跳入井中。据西方通讯社八月十七日报道，西加里曼丹人民武装在八月中旬又打了一次伏击战，打死反动军人两名。另据安塔拉通讯社报道，八月二十四日，人民武装在三发县桑告勒多地区伏击了一支印尼反动军队的巡逻队。敌军巡逻队被打得昏头转向，却“没有发觉这次袭击是来自哪一个方向”。雅加达电台十月二日在广播中透露，一支人民武装十月一日在山口羊的唐加尔—拉博地区袭击了一支印尼反动军队，打死敌人若干名。美联社十月十八日报道，西加里曼丹人民武装，在桑告勒多地区伏击了印尼反动军队的巡逻队，打死了六名反动军人，缴获了一些美制来福枪。据印尼全国合作通讯社十月二十日报道，最近，西加里曼丹人民武装在孟嘉影地区的梅拉布山附近伏击了刚从爪哇调来的一支印尼反动军队。
    据印尼反动报纸透露，西加里曼丹人民武装还在西加里曼丹的三发、塞卢瓦斯、特巴斯和桑告勒多等地建立了游击活动地区。这个地区的居民有着长期革命斗争的传统，在过去三百五十年的历史中，从来没有被任何帝国主义和殖民主义征服过。人民武装在这个地区，开展了广泛的游击活动。
    据安塔拉通讯社透露，在东加里曼丹，一支人民武装八月下旬伏击了印尼反动军警。据报道，在中爪哇，一支人民武装正在富有革命传统的麦拉比山区继续进行斗争。西方通讯社透露，这支人民武装在九月初袭击了一支印尼反动军队的巡逻队。他们机动灵活，打了就走，安全撤退。东爪哇普洛索克拉登地区的革命人民，也在开展武装斗争活动。在北苏拉威西，最近，人民武装又在冷布韦安山区同印尼反动军队进行了一次战斗。
    印尼各地人民武装斗争的兴起，特别是西加里曼丹人民武装斗争的发展，引起了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的惶恐不安。据安塔拉通讯社九月二十三日报道，加里曼丹反动军队的头头最近在马辰召开了“特别会议”，为加紧镇压人民武装进行阴谋策划。
    印尼革命人民的武装斗争必将蓬勃发展。这是任何反动力量所阻挡不了的。不管苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权如何进行垂死挣扎，都无法摆脱灭亡于人民战争的火海的命运。
