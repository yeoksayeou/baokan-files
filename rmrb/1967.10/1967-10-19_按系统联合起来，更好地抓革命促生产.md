After the announcement by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on implementing revolutionary great alliances by system, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in our Beijing Knitting Factory and all revolutionary masses of the factory were filled with enthusiasm and joy. Everyone repeatedly shouted excitedly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The good news arrived, and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations immediately organized all revolutionary masses of the factory to listen to the broadcast, read the newspaper, post slogans, and deeply propagate and seriously convey the message. They held discussions and unanimously agreed: This is the greatest concern, love, encouragement, and inspiration from our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao spoke our hearts, once again pointing out the direction for us to advance. We enthusiastically respond and resolutely carry it out!

During the discussion, everyone shared their personal experiences about the benefits of implementing revolutionary great alliances by administrative departments. Everyone unanimously felt that after our factory learned from the experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill on September 19 and achieved revolutionary great alliances, our thoughts were unified, our steps were coordinated, and it became easier to grasp the revolution and promote production.

After implementing revolutionary great alliances by administrative departments, the revolutionary masses of our proletariat in the factory have taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously grasping the revolution, and vigorously promoting production. This has brought about a completely new situation in both revolution and production. Now, the movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is more vigorous, revolutionary great alliances are more consolidated, the great criticism is better, and production indicators are continuously rising. The quality of production has also improved. Since achieving revolutionary great alliances on September 19, the average daily output has increased by 3.1%. From October 10, when Chairman Mao's latest instructions were conveyed, to October 14, the average daily output increased by another 6.1%. The facts have proven that only by implementing revolutionary great alliances by department can we better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, develop and consolidate revolutionary great alliances, achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and turn the factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　按系统联合起来，更好地抓革命促生产
　　北京针织总厂无产阶级革命派大联合委员会
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革关于按照系统实行革命大联合的通知发表后，我们北京针织总厂支左的解放军同志和全厂的无产阶级革命群众群情激昂，欢欣鼓舞，大家一遍遍地激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    喜讯传来，在厂支左的解放军同志和革命群众组织的负责人立即组织全厂的革命群众收听广播，读报纸，张贴标语，并深入车间大力宣传，认真传达，分别召开了座谈会。大家一致认为：这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部向我们发出的新的战斗号召，是毛主席他老人家对我们的最大的关怀，最大的爱护，最大的鞭策，最大的鼓舞。他老人家说出了我们的心里话，又一次给我们指明了前进的方向。我们最最热烈地响应，最最坚决地照办！
    座谈会上，大家都以亲身经历畅谈了按行政部门实行革命大联合的好处。大家一致感觉到，我厂在九月十九日学习贵阳棉纺厂的经验，实现革命大联合以后，思想统一了，步调一致了，革命和生产好抓了。
    在按行政部门实现革命大联合以后，我厂无产阶级革命派以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使革命和生产都出现了全新的面貌。现在，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更加高涨，革命大联合越来越巩固，革命的大批判搞得越来越好，生产指标不断上升，生产质量也有提高。从九月十九日实现革命大联合以后，平均日产量提高百分之三点一；从本月十日传达毛主席最新指示到十四日，平均日产量又提高百分之六点一。事实证明，只有按照部门实现革命大联合，才能更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，发展和巩固革命的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
