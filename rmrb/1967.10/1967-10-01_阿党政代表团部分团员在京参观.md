Members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation visited the 27th Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and the famous clay sculpture group “The Rent Collection Courtyard” in Beijing today, and were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses.

Thousands of revolutionary workers at the 27th Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory held high portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, waved the national flags of both China and Albania, and beat drums and gongs to welcome their Albanian comrades. When the Albanian comrades arrived at the factory, the welcoming crowd applauded enthusiastically and shouted slogans such as “Long live Chairman Mao!” and “Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!”

The Albanian comrades and Chinese revolutionary workers held a warm and brotherly discussion. An old worker who had participated in the 27th February strike presented the Albanian Party and Government Delegation with precious gifts—a crescent-shaped axe and a hammer. The Albanian comrades presented a red banner to the Chinese workers. At this moment, the entire venue resounded with shouts of “Mao Zedong—Enver” and “Enver—Mao Zedong.”

When the Albanian comrades left the factory, thousands of revolutionary workers lined the streets to see them off, enthusiastically shouting, “Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!” and “Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!”

This morning, some members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation also visited the large clay sculpture group “The Rent Collection Courtyard.”

On the 27th, some members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation visited the Beijing Stamp Factory and were warmly welcomed by the workers.

    阿尔巴尼亚同志和中国革命工人举行了兄弟般的亲切的座谈。曾经参加过二七大罢工的老工人，向阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团赠送了珍贵的礼物——一把月牙斧、一把铁锤。阿尔巴尼亚同志把一面红色的锦旗，赠给中国工人。这时候，全场响起了“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”的欢呼声。
    当阿尔巴尼亚同志们离工厂时，数千革命职工夹道欢送，热烈欢呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
