The broad masses of officers and soldiers and revolutionary workers of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically launched the "Year of Four-Wang" learning campaign, determined to achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution and pledge to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, the broad masses of officers and soldiers and revolutionary workers of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "struggle against the private character and criticize revisionism." Taking Wang Jianwen, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, as an example, they have actively learned and applied the "Three Articles," fiercely struggled against the "private" character, and strongly criticized revisionism. This has further enhanced their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their absolute loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. In all fields, a new situation has emerged where the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held even higher, Mao Zedong's works are learned and applied even better, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments are closely followed, striving to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The heroic deeds of Wang Jianwen, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, spread throughout the units, organs, factories, hospitals, warehouses, and academies under the General Logistics Department this summer. At that time, the Political Department of the General Logistics Department issued instructions, requiring all units to carry out activities to learn from Comrade Wang Jianwen. The party committees and political organs of various units responded promptly, using newspapers, propaganda teams, and reporting teams in various forms to widely publicize Wang Jianwen's glorious deeds. Engineering troops fighting in the mountains, motor transport companies that have been traveling in the snowy highlands for years, military stations along the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways, horse farms on the border, and all units in various industries have enthusiastically launched activities to learn from Wang Jianwen. Chairman Mao's great call to "struggle against the private character and criticize revisionism," and the moving deeds of Wang Jianwen, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, who fiercely struggled against the "private" character and thoroughly uprooted revisionism, have once again inspired the broad masses of officers and soldiers and revolutionary workers. They have held oath-taking meetings, reporting meetings, and experience-sharing meetings, published wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, and expressed their boundless class feelings of love for Chairman Mao. In learning Chairman Mao's great call to "struggle against the private character and criticize revisionism," they compared themselves with Wang Jianwen's deeds, shared their thoughts, found gaps, and made plans. They all expressed their determination to learn from Wang Jianwen and pledge to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Learning from Wang Jianwen, the heart has only the red sun.

When Wang Jianwen suffered severe brain injuries and his memory was severely damaged, he forgot everything, but he did not forget Chairman Mao. He did not forget the moving deeds taught by Chairman Mao, which moved people to tears. Everyone said that Wang Jianwen was able to stand out in critical moments, fundamentally because he had only Chairman Mao in his heart and only Mao Zedong Thought. He truly achieved unbounded loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and truly achieved what Vice Chairman Lin Biao taught: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." In the learning process, each unit first focused on the fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, further enhancing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their absolute loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. The officers and soldiers of a certain engineering regiment fighting in the mountains, through learning from Wang Jianwen, concentrated their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao into an intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism movement and the "three supports, two militaries" work, which was done even better. The 9th Company, where Wang Jianwen is stationed, has been evaluated as a "four-good" company for six consecutive years and is an advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works. In the activity of deeply learning from Wang Jianwen, through the method of "four remembrances and four discussions," they praised and extolled Chairman Mao: remembrance of family history, talking about Chairman Mao's kindness; remembrance of the growth of the company and individuals, talking about Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness; remembrance of the heroes' journey, talking about the great power of Mao Zedong Thought; remembrance of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the development of the world revolution, talking about Chairman Mao's great achievements. From the depths of their hearts, they burst out with boundless class feelings of love for Mao Zedong, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, and the awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works was greatly enhanced, achieving the goal of studying when there is time and using what has been learned.

Learning from Wang Jianwen, be a pioneer in struggling against the private character and criticizing revisionism.

Wang Jianwen's spirit of fiercely learning and applying the "Three Articles" and fiercely struggling against the "private" character of "a moment's thought" deeply educated the broad masses of officers and soldiers and revolutionary workers. The revolutionary cadres of the direct organs of the General Logistics Department, reviewing the facts of class struggle since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, comparing themselves with Wang Jianwen, and rereading the "Three Articles," more deeply realized that "struggling against the private character and criticizing revisionism" is the basic content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for "struggling against the private character and criticizing revisionism." Struggling against the private character is preventing revisionism. Only by daring to struggle against the private character and thoroughly eliminating it can one better prevent and oppose revisionism. They combined the actual situation of the Cultural Revolution, fiercely struggled against the "private" character, and thoroughly uprooted the poisonous roots of "revisionism." A member of a certain regiment's party committee deeply felt that Wang Jianwen became a soldier with "public" character first after joining the army for a year and became a hero who feared neither hardship nor death. We are older than him in age and have received more education from the party, but our degree of thought revolutionization is not as high as his. The difference lies in that we do not study Chairman Mao's works as diligently as he does, Mao Zedong Thought does not take root in our minds as deeply as his, and we do not struggle against the "private" character as fiercely as he does. After learning from Wang Jianwen, they demanded more of themselves in every aspect, deeply went to the companies and soldiers to study the "Three Articles" together, took the lead in exposing their thoughts, finding gaps, and further strengthened their thought revolutionization. The old soldier of the Red Army, the director of a certain warehouse, Ma Zhiyuan, learned the "Three Articles" with the gaps between himself and Wang Jianwen, deeply realizing that revolution is not about the length of time, and being red is not about age. The most fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to sincerely reform one's worldview. The leading cadres learned first, struggled against the private character and criticized revisionism first, and strongly promoted the thought revolutionization of the troops. In the activity of learning from Wang Jianwen, various units held meetings to control the "private" character and praise the "public" character, combined with the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, fiercely struggled against the "private" character from the depths of their souls, and thoroughly uprooted the roots of "revisionism." Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "seizing the day," fiercely struggling against the "private" character of "a moment's thought." They realized from practice that eliminating one part of selfishness increases one part of love for Chairman Mao, eliminating one part of selfishness follows Chairman Mao one step more. Struggling against the private character every day, following Chairman Mao every day, struggling against the private character for a lifetime, following Chairman Mao for a lifetime.

Learning from Wang Jianwen, forever follow Chairman Mao, dare to go to the knife mountain and fire sea.

In the activity of learning from Wang Jianwen, the broad masses of officers and soldiers and revolutionary workers all followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments like Wang Jianwen, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions in every aspect, learned and applied what they had learned, and continuously raised the level of thought revolutionization to new heights. The "Iron Transport Team on the Sichuan-Tibet Line" named by the Ministry of National Defense launched activities to learn from, compare with, and catch up with Wang Jianwen, seized every bit of time during the journey to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, used the steering wheel of Mao Zedong Thought to control the steering wheel in their hands, and greatly promoted the spirit of unity and cooperation, overcoming the difficulties of thin air and dangerous roads, and safely completing the transportation tasks. On the Kunlun Mountains, the Five-Dao-Liang military station, known as the "snow mountain hot spring," issued a steel oath: "Learn from the hero Wang Jianwen, be a pioneer in breaking the private character and establishing the public character, plant roots under the Kunlun Mountains, and dedicate our lives to the ice mountains and snow peaks." The seven old soldiers of this military station who have served beyond their term expressed after learning from Wang Jianwen's deeds: although our service term has ended, the revolutionary cause of the proletariat is not yet completed. The Kunlun Mountains are our home, and Five-Dao-Liang is our battlefield for struggling for communism. Where the party needs us on the plateau, we will fight on the plateau for a lifetime. The Third Horse Team of the Shandan Horse Farm under the Qilian Mountains has a heavier production task this year than any other year. They combined the activity of learning from Wang Jianwen to launch a high tide of grasping the revolution and promoting production.

　　活学活用“老三篇”狠斗“私”字猛批修正主义
    解放军总后勤部广大指战员和革命职工热烈展开学习年四旺活动，决心在文化大革命中立新功，誓做毛主席好战士
    据新华社十五日讯　中国人民解放军总后勤部广大指战员和革命职工，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的战斗号令，以毛主席的好战士年四旺为榜样，活学活用“老五篇”，狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，进一步增强了对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的绝对忠诚，各行各业都出现了更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，在无产阶级文化大革命中争立新功的新局面。
    毛主席的好战士年四旺的英雄事迹，是今年夏天传遍总后勤部所属部队、机关、工厂、医院、仓库和院校的。当时，总后勤部政治部发出指示，要求各单位深入开展向年四旺同志学习的活动。各部队党委和政治机关闻风而动，运用报刊、宣传队、报告团等各种形式，广泛宣传了年四旺的光辉事迹。战斗在崇山峻岭的工程部队，长年奔驰在风雪高原的汽车连队，青藏、川藏两条公路沿线的兵站，地处边疆的军马场和各行各业各个单位，都热烈展开了向年四旺学习的活动。毛主席发出“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，毛主席的好战士年四旺狠斗“私”字，猛挖修根的动人事迹，再次激励着广大指战员和革命职工，他们纷纷召开誓师会、报告会、讲用会，出墙报、黑板报，满怀对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，在学习毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召时，对照年四旺的事迹，谈感想，找差距，订措施。他们纷纷表示，决心学习年四旺，誓做毛主席的好战士。
    学习年四旺，心中只有红太阳
    年四旺在颅脑严重损伤，记忆力受到严重破坏的时候，什么都忘了，就是不忘毛主席，不忘毛主席教导的动人事迹，激动得人们热泪盈眶。大家说，年四旺所以能在关键时刻挺身而出，根本的根本，是他心里只有毛主席，只有毛泽东思想。他真正做到了无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，真正做到了林彪副主席所教导的：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”。在学习中，各单位首先抓住了对毛主席，对毛泽东思想的这个根本态度问题，进一步增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的绝对忠诚。战斗在崇山峻岭间的工程某团的指战员，通过学习年四旺，把对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱凝结在对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨上，深入地开展革命的大批判运动，“三支”“两军”工作，也做得好上加好。连续六年被评为四好连队的学习毛主席著作先进集体、年四旺所在部队九连党支部，在深入开展学习年四旺的活动中，通过四忆四谈的方法，大赞大颂毛主席，即：忆家史，大谈毛主席的恩情；忆连队和个人的成长，大谈毛主席的英明伟大；忆英雄走过的道路，大谈毛泽东思想的巨大威力；忆中国革命的胜利和世界革命的发展，大谈毛主席的丰功伟绩。他们从内心深处迸发出对世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情，学习毛主席著作的自觉性大大增强，做到了有时间必学，学了必用。
    学习年四旺，斗私批修当闯将
    年四旺狠学狠用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字“一闪念”的革命精神，深深地教育了广大指战员和革命职工。总后勤部直属机关无产阶级革命派战士，回顾无产阶级文化大革命以来阶级斗争的事实，对照年四旺，重温“老三篇”，更加深刻地体会到：“斗私，批修”是无产阶级文化大革命的基本内容，光焰无际的毛泽东思想是“斗私，批修”的最锐利的武器。斗私就是防修，只有勇于斗私，彻底破私，才能更好地防修反修。他们结合文化大革命的实际，狠斗“私”字，狠挖“修”字的毒根。某团党委成员深有体会地说，年四旺入伍一年就成了“公”字当头的战士，成为一不怕苦，二不怕死的英雄，我们论年龄比他大，论受党的教育比他多，可是思想革命化程度不如他高，千差万差，就差在学习毛主席著作不如他勤，毛泽东思想在头脑里扎根不如他深，斗“私”字不如他狠。他们学习年四旺以后，处处以高标准要求自己，深入连队和战士一起学习“老三篇”，带头亮思想，找差距，思想革命化进一步加强，领导作风更加深入。红军老战士、某仓库主任马志远，带着自己同年四旺的差距学习“老三篇”，深刻认识到，革命不在时间长短，心红不在年龄大小，最根本的一条就是要用毛泽东思想老老实实地改造世界观。领导干部学在前，斗私、批修在先，有力地带动了部队的思想革命化。在学习年四旺的活动中，各部队纷纷召开了控“私”会，颂“公”会，结合对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，从灵魂深处狠斗“私”字，狠挖“修”根。大家遵照毛主席“只争朝夕”的教导，狠抓“私”字“一闪念”，他们从实践中体会到，斗掉一分私心就对毛主席增加一分热爱，斗掉一分私心就紧跟毛主席一步，天天斗私，天天紧跟毛主席，一辈子斗私，一辈子紧跟毛主席。
    学习年四旺，永远紧跟毛主席，刀山火海都敢上
    在学习年四旺的活动中，广大指战员和革命职工，都象年四旺那样，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，处处按照毛主席的指示办事，学了就用，学一点，用一点，思想革命化不断提到新的高度。国防部命名的“川藏线上的钢铁运输班”，开展了学年四旺、比年四旺、赶年四旺的活动，抓紧行车途中的点滴时间活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想的方向盘，统帅手中的方向盘，团结协作的精神大发扬，克服了空气稀薄、道路险阻的困难，安全完成了运输任务。在昆仑山上被誉为“雪山温泉”的五道梁兵站，发出了“学习英雄年四旺，破私立公当闯将，昆仑山下把根扎，冰山雪岭献终身”的钢铁誓言。这个兵站的七名超期服役的老战士在学习年四旺的事迹后表示：我们的服役期虽然满了，但是无产阶级的革命事业还没有完成。昆仑山就是我们的家，五道梁就是我们为共产主义奋斗的战场，党需要我在高原，我就在高原战斗一辈子。祁连山下的山丹军马场马三队，今年的生产任务比以往任何一年都重，他们结合开展学习年四旺的活动，掀起了抓革命，促生产的高潮。
