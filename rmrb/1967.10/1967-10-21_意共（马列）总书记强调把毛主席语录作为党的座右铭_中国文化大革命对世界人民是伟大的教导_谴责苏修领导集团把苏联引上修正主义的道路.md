	Rome, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- The general secretary of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Fosco Dinucci, said in a speech at a gathering in Rome on Oct. 15 that he warmly praised Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The gathering was held to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist). Hundreds of party cadres, grass-roots members, and sympathizers from all over Italy attended the meeting. Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao were hung on the stage.

	Dinucci stressed: "Our party is proud to stand on the side of the great Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong." At this point, all the attendees stood up and gave a thunderous applause.

	Dinucci said: At present, China is undergoing a great and historic process. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has world significance and is the greatest lesson for the people of the world today.

	He recalled: Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people achieved victory in the socialist revolution and defeated enemies both at home and abroad. However, today, the Soviet Union has been led by the revisionist leadership onto the path of revisionism.

	He pointed out that Chairman Mao summed up the historical experience of the Paris Commune and the October Revolution, launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thus prevented the emergence of revisionism in China.

	In his speech, Dinucci highly praised Mao Zedong Thought. He said: The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) is studying Mao Zedong Thought. "Our party takes Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding ideology." We must deeply study Mao Zedong Thought, starting from the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao." We can find the essence of Marxism-Leninism in every quotation. This will greatly help us solve our problems. Dinucci said: "We especially take the quotation from Chairman Mao, 'We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, we will not be able to accomplish anything,' as our party's motto."

	In his speech, Dinucci strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's despicable actions of acting as the running dog of U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Vietnam. He pointed out that under the pretext of military aid, the Soviet revisionist leadership is plotting to betray the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	Dinucci finally called on all party members and sympathizers to raise high the great banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, to build a powerful vanguard of the proletariat of Marxism-Leninism, and to actively fight against imperialism and modern revisionism.

    意共（马列）总书记强调把毛主席语录作为党的座右铭
    中国文化大革命对世界人民是伟大的教导
    谴责苏修领导集团把苏联引上修正主义的道路
    新华社讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）总书记福斯科·迪努齐十五日在罗马举行的一次集会上发表讲话，热烈赞扬毛泽东思想和中国的无产阶级文化革命。
    这次集会是为庆祝意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）建立一周年而举行的。数百名来自意大利全国各地的党的干部、基层党员和党的同情者参加了大会。主席台上悬挂着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的巨幅画像。
    迪努齐强调说：“我们党为站在由毛泽东领导的伟大的中国共产党一边而引以自豪”。这时，全体与会者起立，并且发出了雷鸣般的掌声。
    迪努齐说：目前，中国正在经历着一个伟大的、具有历史意义的历程，中国的无产阶级文化大革命具有世界性的重大意义，“是对当代全世界人民的一次最伟大的教导”。
    他回顾说：在列宁和斯大林的领导下，苏联人民曾经取得了社会主义革命的胜利，打败了国内外的敌人。但是，今天，苏联已经被修正主义领导集团引上了修正主义的道路。
    他强调指出，毛主席总结了巴黎公社和十月革命的历史经验，开展了在无产阶级专政条件下的无产阶级文化大革命，从而防止在中国出现修正主义。
    迪努齐在讲话中高度赞扬了毛泽东思想。他说：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）正在学习毛泽东思想。“我们党以毛泽东思想作为自己的学说。”我们要深刻地研究毛泽东思想，从红色的宝书《毛主席语录》入手。我们能够在每一条语录中找到马克思列宁主义的精华。这大大有助于解决我们的问题。迪努齐说：“我们特别把‘我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。’这条毛主席语录作为我们党的座右铭。”
    迪努齐在讲话中强烈谴责苏修领导集团充当美帝国主义侵越帮凶的卑鄙行径。他指出，苏修领导集团在虚伪的军事援助幌子下面，策划出卖越南人民抗美救国斗争的阴谋。
    迪努齐最后号召全体党员和党的同情者高举马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的伟大旗帜，壮大革命的马克思列宁主义的无产阶级先锋队，积极进行反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争。
