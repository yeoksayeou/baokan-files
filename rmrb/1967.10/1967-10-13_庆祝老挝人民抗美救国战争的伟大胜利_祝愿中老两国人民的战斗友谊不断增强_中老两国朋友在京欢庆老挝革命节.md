Today marks the 22nd anniversary of the Lao Revolution. Lao friends in Beijing and comrades from various sectors of the capital gathered to celebrate the great victory of the Lao people's war against American aggression for national salvation and to wish for the ever-strengthening combat friendship between the peoples of China and Laos.

To celebrate the glorious revolutionary holiday of the Lao people, Mrs. Kuying Bunchan, a Lao friend in Beijing, held a reception tonight. Mrs. Kuying Bunchan and other Lao friends delivered speeches at the reception. In their speeches, they wished our great leader Chairman Mao a long life and praised the great thought of Mao Zedong as a precious treasure for the revolutionary people of the world. They wished the Chinese Cultural Revolution even greater triumphs. Mrs. Kuying Bunchan emphasized in her speech that the Lao people must combine Mao Zedong Thought with their revolutionary struggle in Laos, persist in armed struggle, and strive for the final victory in the anti-American struggle.

Vice Chairman Zhou Yiping of the China Council for the Promotion of International Friendship praised the Lao people for, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, holding high the banner of anti-imperialist revolution for 22 years, displaying the tremendous power of people's war, and achieving one major victory after another. Zhou Yiping said that the Lao people have made a valuable contribution to the common struggle of all peoples of the world against American imperialism. Zhou Yiping expressed that the Chinese people will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and resolutely support the Lao people in carrying the war against American aggression for national salvation through to the end.

This afternoon, the China Council for the Promotion of International Friendship and the China-Laos Friendship Association held a film screening to celebrate the glorious holiday of the Lao people. The screening featured a Lao documentary reflecting the revolutionary struggle of the Lao people and a Chinese documentary titled "The World's People Love Chairman Mao." Representatives from relevant departments, including Ding Xilin and Zhou Yiping, revolutionary masses from the capital, Mrs. Kuying Bunchan, and the Lao Cultural Delegation led by Benping Pantong, who are currently visiting Beijing, attended the film screening.
