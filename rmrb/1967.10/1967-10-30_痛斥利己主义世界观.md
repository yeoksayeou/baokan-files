For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has relentlessly peddled a whole set of petty-bourgeois philosophy, such as "suffering a small loss for a big gain," and has vigorously promoted the egoistic worldview of fighting for personal fame, profit, and power. This has poisoned people's souls and attempted to realize his plot to restore capitalism.

Fighting for personal fame is an important part of the egoistic worldview that the Chinese Khrushchev promotes. He blatantly advocates: "When history is written in the future, having your name written in it is the ultimate personal fame and profit." In his view, doing revolution is for the sake of gaining fame, for the sake of having one's name written in history. He also vigorously promotes the idea of "doing things that others are unwilling to do, not fearing misfortune or hardship, and naturally gaining the support, love, and recommendation of comrades, thus gaining the upper hand." The Chinese Khrushchev is a "headline seeker." What he says about "not fearing misfortune or hardship" is all deceitful, while "gaining the upper hand" and "gaining fame" to achieve selfish goals is the real intention.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not be a personal hero or seek headlines," and "headline-seeking and the like are the most despicable." Those who have hope are not those who love to seek headlines. However, the Chinese Khrushchev wraps the most despicable headline-seeking in layers of sugar coating, poisoning people's souls, with extremely sinister intentions. This is also a major revelation of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois nature.

While promoting the idea of fighting for fame, the Chinese Khrushchev also openly incites people to fight for profit. In his view, doing revolution is for the sake of living conditions, wages, and remuneration. He tells the sent-down youth: "Going to the countryside to farm is like going to college for five years. Ten or twenty years later, your living conditions will not be much worse than those of college graduates." What nonsense! Is going to the countryside to farm for the sake of securing living conditions comparable to those of college graduates? This is a malicious distortion and slander of the sent-down youth who, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, are filled with revolutionary aspirations to build socialist new countryside. He also openly incites people to fight for wages, to strive for higher wages, saying: "Getting more wages is like a reward, getting less is like self-criticism." He also says: "Those who wholeheartedly serve the people will be rewarded by the people." Isn't this treating "doing revolution" and "serving the people" as a means to make money?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members... should be models of integrity, not seeking personal gain, doing more work, and taking less remuneration." "Actively working hard and not seeking personal gain," with a spirit of "having no selfish and egotistical heart." Doing revolution without seeking remuneration is the communist ideology. However, the Chinese Khrushchev openly promotes the egoistic worldview of "working for money" and striving for money. Isn't this the living image of a landlord and capitalist? Money! Money! Everything is for money. As Engels said: "In the eyes of the bourgeoisie, nothing in the world exists except for money, including themselves, because they live only to make money, and they know no other happiness except quick enrichment, and no other pain except the loss of money." The Chinese Khrushchev is exactly such a money-grubber.

The Chinese Khrushchev knows that only with "power" can one gain both fame and profit. Therefore, he often talks about the methods of personal struggle for power and promotion. He tells the sent-down youth: I advise you not to be cadres after returning to the countryside, not even accountants. Seriously farm for three to five years, and then you can be cadres of townships, counties, provinces, or even the central government. This is the "promotion map" that the Chinese Khrushchev draws for the sent-down youth.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people," and "we communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution." For revolution or for "being an official," these are two completely opposite worldviews, and also a touchstone to test whether a person is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary. The "promotion map" that the Chinese Khrushchev meticulously draws precisely exposes him as a thoroughgoing false revolutionary and counter-revolutionary.

Fighting for fame, profit, and power is the concrete manifestation of the Chinese Khrushchev's egoistic worldview. The core of egoism is the word "self," which is the root of revisionism.

In a socialist society, class and class struggle still exist. Domestic and foreign class enemies conspire to restore capitalism, always using the word "self" to poison people's souls, making them tools for their evil activities. The Chinese Khrushchev promotes the word "self" precisely to prepare the ideological ground for his plot to usurp the party and the country, restore capitalism, and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Completely eliminating the word "self" is a long-term political task. The word "self" is not uprooted, and the word "revisionism" will not die out. As long as the word "self" exists in our minds, the Chinese Khrushchev will still have ideological command, and capitalism will have the danger of restoration. The current Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has achieved decisive victories, and a small handful of those in power taking the capitalist road will inevitably make a desperate struggle. They will use this word "self," use the factionalism of the petty bourgeoisie, individualism, sectionalism, small-groupism, anarchism, and the like, from the right and "left" sides, to shake and split the headquarters of the proletariat led by Chairman Mao, disrupt the direction of the struggle, and attempt to save their failure.

The reality of the intense and complex class struggle over the past year has made us see more clearly that the word "self" is precisely a "gap" through which the enemy attacks us. We must, with the spirit of "seizing the day," take "criticizing selfishness and revisionism" as the guideline, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionism, completely eliminate the poison of egoism he has spread, and constantly arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. We must thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, thoroughly criticize the word "self," and thoroughly establish the word "public." Let us welcome the red world of Mao Zedong Thought with full confidence!

    痛斥利己主义世界观
    总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫竭力贩卖“吃小亏，占大便宜”等一整套市侩哲学，拚命鼓吹为个人争名、争利、争权的利己主义世界观，毒害人们的灵魂，妄图实现其复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    为个人争名，是中国赫鲁晓夫推销的利己主义世界观的一个重要内容。他露骨地宣扬：“将来写历史的时候，写上你一个名字，个人名利莫过于这个吧！”在他看来，干革命就是为了出名，就是为了将来写历史的时候写上自己的一个名字。他还竭力鼓吹“做一些人家不愿做的事，不怕倒霉，不怕困苦，自然得到同志的拥护爱戴和推荐，这风头便是你们出了。”中国赫鲁晓夫是个“风头迷”，什么“不怕倒霉，不怕困苦”，统统都是骗人的手段，是假的，而“出风头”、“出名”，达到利己的目的，才是真的。
    毛主席教导我们：“不要个人英雄主义和风头主义”，“……风头主义等等，是最可鄙的”。真正有希望的人，不是爱出风头的人。而中国赫鲁晓夫，却把最可鄙的风头主义裹上层层的糖衣，毒害人们的灵魂，其用心极为险恶。这也是中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级的反动本性的一个大暴露。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在鼓吹争名的同时，还公开鼓动人们去争利。在他看来，干革命就是为了生活待遇、工资、报酬。他对下乡知识青年说：“下乡种地等于上五年大学。十年二十年之后……，生活待遇上不见得比大学毕业生差多少。”这是什么话！难道下乡种地就是为了谋取一个和大学毕业生差不多的生活待遇吗？这是对在毛泽东思想哺育下，怀着革命的雄心壮志去建设社会主义新农村的知识青年的恶毒丑化和诬蔑。他还公开鼓动人们去争工资，为多挣工资而奋斗，说什么：“工资拿的多等于奖励，少的等于自我批评。”又说：“一心一意为人民服务的，人民是会给报酬的。”这岂不是把“干革命”、“为人民服务”当作挣钱的一种手段吗？
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员……应该是十分廉洁、不用私人、多做工作、少取报酬的模范。”“积极肯干，不谋私利”，要有“毫无自私自利之心的精神。”干革命不计报酬，这是共产主义思想。而中国赫鲁晓夫公然鼓吹“干活拿钱”，为钱而奋斗这套利己主义世界观。这不是一副活龙活现的地主资本家的嘴脸吗？钱！钱！一切都是为了钱。正如恩格斯所说的：“在资产阶级看来，世界上没有一样东西不是为了金钱而存在的，连他们本身也不例外，因为他们活着就是为了赚钱，除了快快发财，他们不知道还有别的幸福，除了金钱的损失，也不知道还有别的痛苦。”中国赫鲁晓夫，正是这样的一个财迷。
    中国赫鲁晓夫深知，有了“权”才能名利双收。因此，他大讲个人争权升官之道。他对下乡知识青年说：我劝你们回乡后不当干部，连会计都不当，……认真种三、五年地，到那时……就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫给下乡知识青年画的一张“升官图”。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”，“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。为革命，还是为“当官”，这是两种完全对立的世界观，也是检验一个人是真革命，还是假革命的试金石。中国赫鲁晓夫所精心描绘的这张“升官图”，正好暴露了他是一个地地道道的假革命，反革命。
  争名、争利、争权，是中国赫鲁晓夫利己主义世界观的具体表现。利己主义的核心是一个“私”字，它是产生修正主义的根源。
    在社会主义社会，还存在着阶级和阶级斗争。国内外阶级敌人阴谋复辟资本主义，总是利用“私”字来毒害人们的灵魂，使之充当他们进行罪恶活动的工具。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“私”字的目的，就是为他阴谋篡党、篡国，复辟资本主义，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政作思想准备。
    彻底消灭“私”字，是一个长期的政治任务。“私”字不断根，“修”字不绝种。只要我们头脑里的“私”字存在，中国赫鲁晓夫就还有思想上的指挥权，资本主义就有复辟的危险。当前无产阶级文化大革命已取得决定性胜利，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派必然要作垂死挣扎，他们就会利用这个“私”字，利用小资产阶级的派性，个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义、无政府主义等等，从右的和“左”的两个方面动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，扰乱斗争大方向，妄图挽救他们的失败。
    一年来尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争的现实，使我们更加看清了，“私”字正是敌人向我们进攻的一个“缺口”。我们要以“只争朝夕”的精神，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义，彻底肃清他所散布的利己主义的流毒，不断地以毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，大破资产阶级思想，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。让我们满怀信心地迎接红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界吧！
