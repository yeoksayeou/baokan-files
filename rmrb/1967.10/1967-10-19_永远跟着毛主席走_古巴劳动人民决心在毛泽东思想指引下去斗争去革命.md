Forever Follow Chairman Mao
The Cuban Working People Resolve to Struggle and Revolutionize Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Havana: The great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought hold a lofty prestige in the hearts of the Cuban working people. They have expressed their determination to struggle and revolutionize under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

A Cuban worker has a photograph of our great leader Chairman Mao wearing a Red Guard armband hanging on his machine. One day, another Cuban worker asked him why he had hung Chairman Mao's photograph on the machine. He replied, "Mao Zedong Thought has brought us wisdom and strength, inspiring the people to struggle and revolutionize."

In a tourist area in Havana, two Chinese comrades encountered several construction workers. They enthusiastically asked, "Are you Chinese?" The Chinese comrades replied, "We are friends of the Cuban people." One of the workers quickly added, "No, you are brothers of the Cuban people." Then, pointing to the badge of Chairman Mao on the chest of the Chinese comrades, he said, "This is the great leader Mao Zedong. He belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to us Cuban people."

Once, several Chinese comrades visited a famous tourist area. Suddenly, from a distance, they heard the shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Looking far off, about a hundred meters away, three Cuban workers were enthusiastically waving at the Chinese comrades. The Chinese comrades immediately walked towards them and shook hands tightly, expressing their gratitude. They said, "The Chinese people are our brothers. Chairman Mao is the leader of the world's people. We miss Chairman Mao." After a warm conversation, the Chinese comrades said goodbye to them. They shouted even more excitedly, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

One evening, several Chinese comrades visited a museum in Havana and met a Cuban youth worker in his twenties. The worker enthusiastically said, "I greatly admire Chairman Mao and China. I think Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist and the greatest communist in the world."

He said, "The domestic and foreign policies carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao are very correct. Some of my closest friends also admire Chairman Mao and like China. We support the line China is taking and often discuss China's affairs. We are very concerned about your country."

A middle-aged Cuban worker has an infinite love for Chairman Mao and has been eagerly awaiting a Spanish version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Before his wish was fulfilled, he would visit the Chinese comrades and copy two or three quotations from Chairman Mao to take back and study. He carefully copied quotations such as "Create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail more, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause" from the walls of the place where the Chinese comrades lived. After copying the quotations from the walls, he requested to copy them from magazines. The Cuban worker enthusiastically said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the world's people in contemporary times, the greatest Marxist-Leninist. I am convinced of every word Chairman Mao says. I will forever follow Chairman Mao. I regard the enemy's slander and defamation as negative teachers."

　　永远跟着毛主席走
    古巴劳动人民决心在毛泽东思想指引下去斗争去革命
    据新华社讯　哈瓦那消息：伟大的领袖毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想，在古巴劳动人民心目中享有崇高的威信，他们表示要在毛泽东思想的指引下去斗争、去革命。
    一位古巴工人在他使用的机床上，挂着我们伟大领袖毛主席佩戴红卫兵臂章的照片。一天，另一位古巴工人问他，为什么把毛主席的照片挂在机床上。他回答说，“毛泽东思想为我们带来了智慧和力量，鼓舞人民去斗争，去革命。”
    在哈瓦那一个游览区，两位中国同志遇到了几位建筑工人，他们过来热情地问道：“你们是中国人吗？”中国同志回答：“是古巴人民的朋友。”其中一位工人赶忙补充说，“不，你们是古巴人民的兄弟。”然后，他指着中国同志胸前佩戴的毛主席像章说，
  “这是伟大领袖毛泽东，他不只属于中国人民，也属于我们古巴人民。”
    有一次，几个中国同志参观一个著名游览区，突然远处传来了“毛主席万岁！”的呼声。远远望去，离开一百米左右的地方，三位古巴工人正在热情地向中国同志招手。中国同志立即向他们走去，和他们紧紧地握手，表示谢意。他们说，“中国人民是我们的兄弟，毛主席是世界人民的领袖，我们想念毛主席。”在经过热情的谈话以后，中国同志向他们告别，他们更加激动地再次高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    一天晚上，几位中国同志参观在哈瓦那的一所博物馆，碰到一位二十多岁的古巴青年工人，这位工人热情地说：“我非常敬佩毛主席，敬佩中国。我认为毛主席是世界上最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，最伟大的共产主义者。”
    他说：“中国人民在毛主席领导下执行的国内外政策十分正确。”“我的一些最亲密的朋友也和我一样敬佩毛主席，喜欢中国，我们赞成中国实行的路线，经常谈论中国的事，我们很关心你们的国家。”
    一位中年的古巴工人无限热爱毛主席，日夜盼望得到一本西班牙文版《毛主席语录》。愿望未实现以前，他每次到中国同志那里去访问，都要抄写两三条毛主席语录带回去学习。他把中国同志住的地方墙壁上贴着“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”等语录一条一条的细心地抄在笔记本上。抄完了墙上的语录以后，他又要求抄杂志上的。这位古巴工人热情地说：“毛主席是当代世界人民的最伟大的领袖，是最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，我确信毛主席说的每一句话，我永远跟着毛主席走。敌人的造谣和污蔑，我把它看作反面教员”。
