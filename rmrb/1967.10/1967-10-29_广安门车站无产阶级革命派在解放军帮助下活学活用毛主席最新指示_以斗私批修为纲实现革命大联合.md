The People's Liberation Army unit stationed at the Beijing Railway Bureau's Guang'anmen Station has enthusiastically assisted the station's revolutionary masses and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they have fiercely battled the "private" character in their minds, broken down petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and effectively promoted and consolidated revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination." On October 11, a revolutionary committee was established.

Starting from Ideological Education

The revolutionary mass organizations at Guang'anmen Station are basically divided into two major factions: the "Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters" and the "Contact Station." Due to differing views on some specific issues, there was significant opposition between the two factions. The PLA's leftist comrades started with ideological education, first organizing representatives from both factions to study Chairman Mao's works together. At this time, both factions thought: The PLA is going to take a stand this time! We must not lose, we must gain the upper hand. Both sides selected participants who could write, speak, and debate.

On the first day of the study session, both sides had reservations, private interests, and lacked sincerity in solving problems. Therefore, when they began studying the "Three Articles," some people were indifferent, could not listen attentively, could not discuss, and kept their research secret. After analyzing this situation, the PLA organized everyone to repeatedly and seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity. They inspired everyone to genuinely follow the method of "one read, two discuss, three compare, four act," to check and demand of themselves with high standards and high posture. This way, the opposition between the two factions began to ease, and they prepared not "ammunition" but comradely heart-to-heart talks and self-criticism. The leader of the "Headquarters," Dong Zhen Ting, said: "Through study, my mind has opened up. I recalled the past few months of 'internal war' and felt very painful. The bullets were not fired at the capitalists in power who took the capitalist road within the party, but at our own class brothers." He expressed his determination to go to the "Contact Station" for a thorough self-criticism. The leader of the "Contact Station" also said: "In the past, we criticized others more and self-criticized less, always wanting to overthrow the 'Headquarters.' These actions deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. This time, we must go to the 'Headquarters' for a serious self-criticism."

For the Revolution, Promote Revolutionary Great Unity

With a common thought, there is also a common language. After the study session, the leaders of both factions and most core members of both factions had the desire to achieve revolutionary great unity.

Initially, the "Contact Station" believed that to achieve revolutionary great unity, both sides should remove their signs, merge the two organizations, establish a unified leadership team, and even proposed the name "Revolutionary Great Unity Committee." Some in the "Headquarters" heard this and felt half-hearted. The "Headquarters" originally thought they were the power-holding organization that emerged from the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, with strong people and horses, and should represent the revolutionary workers of the unit. They did not take the "Contact Station" seriously. They did not expect the other side to propose achieving revolutionary great unity and starting a new name. Due to some in the "Headquarters" not understanding, the revolutionary great unity that had just been brewing was in danger of collapsing. The leader of the "Headquarters," Dong Zhen Ting, understood the active thoughts of the masses and repeatedly did ideological work among the masses, pointing out that revolutionary great unity is the correct direction and the wish of the majority of workers. At this time, some masses suggested: "Just call it the 'September 20 Great Unity Headquarters'!" Dong Zhen Ting heard this and initially thought it sounded good, but then he thought: Chairman Mao calls on us to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. If we firmly hold on to the words 'Headquarters,' we will still refer to it as 'Headquarters' when communicating with the outside world. Isn't this selfishness? The comrades of the "Contact Station" also said it would be best not to have the words 'Headquarters.' In this stalemate, Dong Zhen Ting remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, and the image of Norman Bethune appeared before his eyes. He kept thinking: Comrade Norman Bethune took the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause, showing such great internationalism and communism; how can we only look at a small hill under our noses and cling to the words 'Headquarters'?

After thinking it through, Dong Zhen Ting again persuaded the core members of his organization. This way, both sides reached an agreement and quickly achieved great unity throughout the station, unanimously agreeing to change the name of the great unity organization to: "Revolutionary United Rebel Corps." There are no masses, so there is no core

To achieve revolutionary great unity, how should the leadership members be determined? The masses of both factions were very concerned about this issue. The comrades of the PLA analyzed and believed that the "Headquarters" organization was large, with over five hundred people, while the "Contact Station" was small, with only fifty people. If an election were held, the "Contact Station" might not be able to elect anyone. This would not be conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all revolutionary masses. They convened representatives from both revolutionary mass organizations to study Chairman Mao's "On Rectifying Wrong Ideas in the Party" and the Wenhui Bao editorial "Criticizing 'With Me as the Core,'" through which everyone further understood: the core is relative to the masses, without the masses, there is no core. To seal oneself as the "core" without the trust and mandate of the masses is a "core" without masses, which is not a true core in reality.

After discussions between the representatives of both sides, everyone agreed to resolve the composition of the leadership team through consultation, initially proposing a plan of ten from the "Headquarters" and five from the "Contact Station." When the news spread, some in the "Headquarters" thought it was not reasonable and found Dong Zhen Ting saying: "From January to now, this journey has not been easy. Don't give us away." This was truly a test for Dong Zhen Ting: was it to emphasize factional interests and let selfishness take the lead? Or to insist on proletarian revolutionary principles and put the public first? Now, it was time to revolutionize oneself, and one must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao said: "Because this kind of sectarianism is still serious in some comrades, it is still hindering the implementation of the party's line, so we must carry out extensive education within the party on this issue." Under the enthusiastic help of the PLA, the masses of both factions believed that they should completely break with factionalism and selfishness, unconditionally submit to the highest interests of the proletariat, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Just at this time, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity were transmitted, and the broad masses of workers were overjoyed, quickly establishing the leadership team of the great unity, creating favorable conditions for promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

    广安门车站无产阶级革命派在解放军帮助下活学活用毛主席最新指示
    以斗私批修为纲实现革命大联合
    本报讯　人民解放军驻北京铁路局广安门车站某部，热情地帮助这个车站的无产阶级革命派和革命群众组织的负责人活学活用毛主席最新指示，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，大破小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级的党性，有力地促进和巩固了革命大联合和“三结合”，并在十月十一日成立了革命委员会。
  从思想教育入手
    广安门车站的革命群众组织，基本上分为以“革命造反总部”为代表和以“联络站”为代表的两大派。两派由于对一些具体问题看法有分歧，对立情绪很大。解放军支左的同志从思想教育入手，首先组织两派群众组织的负责人坐在一起学习毛主席著作。这时，两派想：这次解放军要表态了！咱们决不能打败仗，一定要占上风。双方挑选参加学习的人员都是能写、能讲、能辩的。
    学习的第一天，彼此都有顾虑，都有私心，都缺乏解决问题的诚意。因此，开始学习“老三篇”时，有些人漫不经心，听不进耳，讨论不下去，研究问题互相保密。解放军分析了这种情况后，又组织大家反复认真地学习了毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示，启发大家切实地按照“一读、二议、三对照、四行动”的方法，高标准、高姿态地检查自己，要求自己。这样一来，两派的对立情绪开始缓和了，准备的不是“炮弹”，而是同志式的交心和自我批评。“总部”负责人董振庭说：“通过学习，我脑子开了窍，回忆起过去几个月的‘内战’很是痛心。子弹不是打在党内走资本主义道路当权派的身上，而是打了自己的阶级弟兄。”他表示一定要到“联络站”去作全面深刻的检查。“联络站”的负责人也说：“过去我们总是批评别人多，检查自己少，总想整垮‘总部’，这些都背离了毛主席的革命路线，不符合毛泽东思想。这次一定要到‘总部’去作认真检查。”
          为革命促进革命的大联合
    有了共同的思想，也就有了共同的语言。学习结束后，两派群众组织负责人和各派大部分核心成员都有了实现革命大联合的愿望。
    开始，“联络站”认为，既要实现革命大联合，就都把自己的牌子摘掉，两个组织合并，成立统一的领导班子，而且提出组织的名称叫“革命大联合委员会”。“总部”有些人一听，就凉了半截。“总部”原以为自己是从资产阶级反动路线杀出来的掌权组织，人强马壮，理应成为本单位革命职工的代表，因而没有把“联络站”看在眼里。没有料到对方竟提出实现革命大联合，要另起一个新的名称。由于“总部”有些人想不通，刚刚酝酿的革命大联合又有“崩”的危险。“总部”负责人董振庭了解了群众的活思想后，就再三做群众的思想工作，指出革命大联合是大方向，是广大职工的愿望。这时有的群众又提议：“干脆叫‘九·二○大联合总部’吧！”董振庭刚一听，还挺顺耳，可又一转念：毛主席号召我们要斗私，批修，死死抱住“总部”两个字，将来对外联系还是称“总部”，这不是“私”字吗？“联络站”的同志也说最好不要“总部”二字。在这种僵持的情况下，董振庭又想起毛主席的教导，眼前闪现出白求恩的光辉形象，心里不住地翻腾：白求恩同志把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，表现出多么伟大的国际主义、共产主义精神；咱们怎能老看着自己鼻子下的一个小山头，抱着“总部”两个字恋恋不舍呢？
    董振庭想通以后，又对本组织的核心成员进行了说服教育工作。这样，双方达成了协议，很快实现了全站的大联合，并一致同意把大联合的组织名称改为：“革命联合造反团”。没有群众也就没有核心
    要实现革命大联合，怎样确定领导成员？两派的群众都很关心这个问题。解放军的同志作了分析，认为“总部”组织大，有五百多人，“联络站”组织小，只有五十多人，如果选举，“联络站”就有可能一个也选不上。这样不利于调动全体革命群众的积极性。他们就召集两派革命群众组织负责人，学习了毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》以及文汇报《评“以我为核心”》的社论，通过学习，大家进一步明白了：核心是对群众而言的，没有群众也就没有核心。离开了群众的信任和委托而自封为“核心”，这是没有群众的“核心”，实际上也就不成其为真正的核心。
    经过双方负责人商量，大家都同意协商解决领导班子的组成问题，初步提出了“总部”十个，“联络站”五个的方案。消息一传开，“总部”有些群众又想不通，找到董振庭说：“咱们从一月份到现在，这段历程可不容易呀，你可别把我们‘送了礼’。”这对于董振庭来说，可真是个考验：究竟是强调派别利益，“私”字挂帅呢？还是坚持无产阶级革命原则，“公”字当头呢？如今，轮到革自己命的时候了，一定要按照毛主席的指示办事。毛主席说：“因为这种宗派主义在一部分同志中还很严重，还在障碍党的路线的实行，所以我们要针对这个问题在党内进行广大的教育。”在解放军的热情帮助下，两派群众都认为应该同派性一刀两断，同“私”字彻底分家，无条件地服从无产阶级的最高利益，按毛主席的指示办事。正在这时，传来了毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示，广大职工个个欢欣鼓舞，以最快的速度成立了大联合的领导班子，为促进革命的“三结合”创造了有利条件。
