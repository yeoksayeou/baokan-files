At the solemn moment when the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and all the people of China are celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, British imperialism has once again incurred a blood debt to the Chinese people.

On October 1st, the Hong Kong British authorities brazenly dispatched gunboats, police launches, helicopters, and a large number of "riot control" forces to interfere with Chinese crew members and citizens celebrating National Day at the Hong Kong docks, committing a new fascist atrocity. They killed one Chinese resident and arrested nearly one hundred people. The next day, British troops stationed in Hong Kong tore down and seized the Chinese national flag. This is a new and serious political provocation by British imperialism against the People's Republic of China and the 700 million Chinese people.

The Chinese government has lodged the strongest protest against British imperialism's fascist atrocities, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities punish the culprits; release the detained Chinese residents; compensate the families of the deceased and all affected residents for their losses, and apologize publicly for the incident of damaging the Chinese national flag; and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. The British government must comply with these demands unconditionally. Debts must be repaid; non-repayment is not an option.

For an entire century, the Chinese people have suffered from the bullying and oppression of imperialism. However, today the Chinese people have stood up, and the times have changed. Imperialism is declining and heading towards extinction, while the liberated, Mao Zedong-thought-armed great Chinese people have become incredibly strong. Anyone who provokes the great Chinese people will not end well.

Hong Kong is Chinese territory, and Hong Kong compatriots celebrating their great motherland's national day is their sacred and inviolable right. British imperialism attempts to use fascist violence to deprive Hong Kong compatriots of this right, which is absolutely impossible.

British imperialism is both brutally savage and utterly hypocritical. On one hand, it commits savage fascist acts, while on the other, it pretends to be a gentleman, boasting about British-style "democracy," "freedom," and "civilization," and even claims to "improve" and "ease" relations with China. Isn't this pure deception?

The gentlemen of the British Labour Party are most sensitive to being accused of fascism. Just like a person with a festering wound, as soon as someone exposes it, they will jump up. British Foreign Secretary George Brown has already performed this act.

However, no matter how much British imperialism rages, facts speak louder than words. British imperialism commits pure fascist atrocities. Not only have you committed fascist crimes on the great national day of the Chinese people, but over the past five months, you have killed our compatriots in Hong Kong and destroyed evidence; you have carried out large-scale arrests and kidnappings of our patriotic compatriots, conducted illegal trials and torture; you have issued fascist decrees, arbitrarily attacking and destroying patriotic unions, setting fires and looting; you have deployed fully armed troops, police, secret agents, warships, tear gas, machine guns, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to carry out bloody suppression of our patriotic compatriots. You have committed heinous crimes against our compatriots in Hong Kong. You are unquestionably fascists, disciples of Hitler.

British imperialism's fascist atrocities in Hong Kong only reveal its weakness, showing that it can no longer maintain its reactionary and rotten rule without resorting to naked fascist methods, stripping away the false democratic veil. British imperialism is extremely afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought and extremely afraid of the heroic struggle of our Hong Kong compatriots. Over the past five months, the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots has dealt a heavy blow to British imperialism in Hong Kong, causing those imperialists to be terrified. They are now struggling desperately in Hong Kong.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Now is the period of the final struggle of imperialism; it is about to die." British imperialism is already on its last legs, its days are numbered and will not last long.

    强烈抗议英帝的法西斯暴行
　　本报评论员
    正当香港爱国同胞和全中国人民欢庆中华人民共和国成立十八周年光辉节日的庄严时刻，英帝国主义又一次对我国人民欠下了血债。
    十月一日，港英当局公然出动炮艇、水警轮、直升飞机和大批“防暴队”，对在香港码头上欢度国庆节日的我国船员和群众，进行野蛮的干涉，制造了新的法西斯暴行，打死中国居民一人，逮捕近一百人。第二天，驻港英国陆军，悍然撕毁并抢走中国国旗。这是英帝国主义对中华人民共和国和七亿中国人民的新的严重政治挑衅。
    我国政府对英帝国主义这种法西斯暴行，提出了最强烈的抗议，要求港英当局惩办凶手；释放被捕的中国居民；抚恤死难居民，赔偿受害居民一切损失，并对毁坏中国国旗事件，承认错误，公开道歉；保证不再发生类似事件。英国政府必须无条件地照此办理。欠债必须偿还，不还是不行的。
    整整一个世纪，中国人民曾经饱受帝国主义的欺凌和压迫。但是，今天中国人民已经站起来了，时代不同了。帝国主义日趋没落，走向灭亡，而解放了的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大中国人民，已经变得无比的强大。谁如果向伟大的中国人民挑衅，谁就决不会有好下场。
    香港是中国的领土，香港同胞庆祝自己祖国的伟大国庆节，是他们神圣不可侵犯的权利。英帝国主义想用法西斯暴力剥夺我香港同胞的这种权利，是绝对办不到的。
    英帝国主义是野蛮透顶，也是虚伪透顶的。它一面干尽了野蛮的法西斯勾当，一面却装出一副绅士的架子，夸耀英国式的什么“民主”、“自由”、“文明”，并且还扬言要“改善”和“缓和”同中国的关系，这不是纯粹的欺人之谈吗？
    英国工党政府的先生们，最忌讳指责他们是法西斯。正象一个长着烂疮疤的人，只要别人一揭露，他就会跳起来。英国外交大臣布朗先生早已这样表演过了。
    但是，不管英帝国主义者如何暴跳，事实总是胜于雄辩。英帝国主义干的就是十足的法西斯暴行。你们不仅在中国人民伟大的节日犯下了法西斯罪行，而且五个月来，你们在香港杀害我同胞，毁尸灭迹；你们对我爱国同胞实行大规模的逮捕和绑架，实行非法审讯和严刑拷打；你们颁布一道道法西斯法令，任意袭击捣毁爱国工会、纵火抢劫；你们出动全副武装的军队、警察、特务，调动军舰，使用毒性催泪弹、机关枪、装甲车以至直升飞机，对我爱国同胞进行血腥镇压。你们在香港对我国同胞犯下了滔天大罪。你们是不折不扣的法西斯，是希特勒的门徒。
    英帝国主义在香港的法西斯暴行，只能表明它的虚弱，表明它如果不把虚假民主的遮羞布完全去掉，而采用赤裸裸的法西斯手段，已经不能维持其反动腐朽的统治了。英帝国主义极端害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，极端害怕我香港同胞的英勇斗争。五个月来香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争，给予了港英帝国主义以沉重打击，使那些帝国主义者吓破了胆。它们正在香港进行垂死的挣扎。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“现在是帝国主义最后挣扎的时期，它快要死了”。英帝国主义已经气息奄奄，日薄西山，它的寿命决不会很长了。
