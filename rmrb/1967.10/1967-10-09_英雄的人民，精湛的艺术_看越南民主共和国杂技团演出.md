Revolutionary songs echo throughout the south and north, and the east wind carries friendship for ten thousand miles. Amidst the great triumphs of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we are filled with boundless excitement and warmly welcome our comrades from the front lines of the anti-American armed struggle—the Vietnam Democratic Republic Circus Troupe—for their second visit to perform in our country.

The heroic people of Vietnam, under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, have fully unleashed the power of people's war, striking a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary arrogance of the American aggressors. With their glorious achievements and unyielding fighting spirit, the heroic Vietnamese people have set a shining example of daring to struggle and daring to win for all oppressed peoples and nations worldwide. They have made an extremely valuable contribution to the global struggle against American imperialism.

The peoples of China and Vietnam are great neighboring countries that rely on each other and fight shoulder to shoulder. No matter how many difficulties and obstacles we face, we will always stand together with the Vietnamese people, fight together, and achieve victory together.

Previously, the Chinese Circus Troupe visited the heroic Vietnam Democratic Republic for friendly performances, exchanging experiences and deepening our combat friendship with the comrades of the Vietnam Democratic Republic Circus Troupe. This time, we watched their splendid performance with a special sense of closeness. What makes us particularly happy is that our Vietnamese circus comrades have made beneficial attempts to implement the principle of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the great struggle against American imperialism.

The performance includes many programs based on the theme of the struggle against American imperialism, such as "Mobile Shop," "Happy Production and Ready for Battle," "Yankee Go Home," "Joyful Youth in the Park," and the interlude comedy "Shoe Shining," among others. These programs reflect various aspects of the Vietnamese people's brave and wise spirit and their hardworking and simple noble qualities. In these programs, revolutionary content and perfect artistic form are harmoniously united.

The magic act "Mobile Shop" reflects how, in the face of air raids, the commercial sector organizes mobile shops to adapt to the war environment and meet the people's needs. The program not only shows the dedication of the female salesperson but also fully embodies the spirit of "everyone is a soldier." The program is natural and clever, simple yet humorous. The interlude "Shoe Shining" tells the story of a shoe-shiner who cleverly eliminates an American aggressor, reflecting how the people of South Vietnam under American puppet rule bravely and wisely eliminate American aggressors. From this, we feel that the American aggressors in Vietnam have fallen into the vast sea of people's war, awaiting their doom. "Happy Production and Ready for Battle" depicts the life of the various ethnic groups in the Vietnamese mountains, who hold a plow in one hand and a gun in the other, always ready to fight against invading enemies. It is also very novel and vivid. In summary, these programs have positive political content and a fighting spirit, achieving the purpose of "uniting the people, educating the people, striking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." We are greatly inspired by how our Vietnamese comrades use the weapon of circus arts to serve the great struggle against American imperialism.

In the struggle against American imperialism, the Vietnam Democratic Republic Circus Troupe has formed many small teams to perform at the front lines. They perform while participating in the bloody struggle against American imperialism alongside the heroic people. Some comrades have even been awarded for their bravery. The spirit of our Vietnamese comrades, who are not afraid of sacrifice and serve the people wholeheartedly, is worthy of our learning.

We wish our comrades a successful performance!

    英雄的人民，精湛的艺术
    ——看越南民主共和国杂技团演出
　　中国杂技团革命联合委员会
    革命歌声遍南北，东风万里传友情。在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，我们怀着无限兴奋的心情，热烈欢迎来自反美武装斗争前线的文艺战友——越南民主共和国杂技团再度来我国演出。
    英雄的越南人民，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导下，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，沉重地打击了美国侵略者的反革命气焰。英雄的越南人民以自己辉煌的战绩，不屈不挠的斗争意志，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族树立了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的光辉范例，为全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争作出了非常宝贵的贡献。
    中越两国人民是唇齿相依的伟大邻邦，并肩战斗的亲密战友。不管有多少艰难险阻，我们永远和越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    过去，中国的杂技团曾到英雄的越南民主共和国进行过友好访问演出，和越南民主共和国杂技团的同志们互相学习，互相传授经验，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。这次我们看了他们的精彩演出，感到格外的亲切。特别值得我们高兴的是，越南杂技团的战友们在努力贯彻文艺为工农兵服务、为抗美救国的伟大斗争服务方面，作了有益的尝试。杂技团演出的节目中，有许多是以抗美救国斗争为题材的，《流动商店》、《愉快的生产和随时准备战斗》、《美国佬滚蛋》、《公园里的欢乐少年》以及串场滑稽表演《擦皮鞋》等等，从各个不同方面反映了越南人民英勇善战的精神面貌和勤劳朴实的高贵品质，在这些节目中，革命的内容和完美的艺术形式得到了和谐的统一。
    魔术《流动商店》反映的是在防空疏散的情况下，商业部门如何想方设法组织流动售货商店，以适应战争环境，满足了人民的需要。节目既表现了女售货员全心全意为人民服务的品质，同时充分体现了“全民皆兵”的精神。节目自然而又巧妙，朴实而又风趣。串场节目《擦皮鞋》通过一个擦皮鞋的工人如何机智巧妙地消灭一个美国强盗的故事，反映了美伪统治区的越南南方人民如何勇敢机智地消灭美国强盗，从中使我们感到美国强盗在越南已陷落在人民战争的汪洋大海之中，等待他们的只有覆灭的命运。《愉快的生产和随时准备战斗》表现的则是越南山区各族人民一手扶犁一手拿枪，随时准备打击来犯敌人的战斗的生活，也十分新颖生动。总之，这些节目有着积极的政治内容和战斗的气息，起到了“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的作用。越南战友们运用杂技这个武器为抗美救国的伟大斗争服务，我们感到十分鼓舞。
    越南民主共和国杂技团在抗美救国斗争中，组成许多小分队分赴斗争前沿，他们一面演出，一面与英雄的人民一道参加抗美救国的浴血战斗，有些同志还立了战功。越南战友们这种不怕牺牲、全心全意为人民服务的精神，是值得我们学习的。
    祝战友们演出成功！
