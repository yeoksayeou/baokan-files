Hanoi held a grand rally on the evening of September 30 to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	Attending the rally were Politburo member of the Vietnam Labor Party and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly Long Chen, as well as Huang Guoyue, Nguyen Van Huyen, Nguyen Kishi, and Fan Yuchun, among other relevant department heads. Nguyen Van Tinh, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in North Vietnam, also attended the rally.

	Invited to attend the rally were the delegation of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association led by Yang Dezhi, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a member of the National Defense Council, the delegation of Chinese journalists, Deputy Chief of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam Lu Weiqiao, and other embassy staff and Chinese experts.

	Long Chen delivered the opening speech at the rally. He praised the Chinese people for their great achievements in socialist revolution and construction over the past 18 years under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. He said: Vietnam and China are close neighbors with a long history of unity and friendship. The Vietnamese people have always received the sympathy, support, and help of their Chinese brothers in their revolutionary cause. At present, the Chinese people are giving even more decisive, powerful, substantial, and effective support and help to the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.

	Subsequently, Huang Guoyue, president of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, spoke at the rally. After praising the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist revolution and construction over the past 18 years, he said: "At present, the Chinese people are striving to learn Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deeply and extensively throughout the country, and to actively implement the Third Five-Year Plan in the great cause of socialist construction." Huang Guoyue sincerely wished the Chinese people more and greater victories in socialist construction and in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

	Huang Guoyue said: China has always been a close and reliable friend who wholeheartedly supports and helps all oppressed peoples. The Vietnamese people have always received the firm, powerful, substantial, and effective sympathy, support, and help of the Chinese Communist Party, government, and people. Chairman Mao's statement on August 29, 1963, on the heroic struggle of the people of South Vietnam against American imperialism and its lackeys is a brilliant manifestation of the deep sympathy and sincere support of the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people.

	Yang Dezhi, head of the delegation of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, first introduced to the attendees the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist revolution and construction over the past 18 years under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that this is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

	Yang Dezhi said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, not only shattered the dreams of imperialism and modern revisionism to achieve "peaceful evolution" and restore capitalism in our country, but also greatly inspired and supported the revolutionary peoples of all countries who are engaged in anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles.

	Yang Dezhi then enthusiastically praised the glorious victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their great struggle of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. Yang Dezhi said: The great victories achieved by the people of South and North Vietnam have proven to the world that people's war is the most effective weapon to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys; the American imperialist paper tiger is completely beatable. The final victory will definitely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people. Finally, Yang Dezhi said, China and Vietnam are close brothers and neighbors. The Chinese people, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.

    他说：越南和中国是唇齿相依的亲密邻邦，越中两国人民具有悠久的团结友谊，越南人民在自己的革命事业中，一贯得到兄弟的中国人民的同情、支持和帮助。当前，中国人民对于越南人民的抗美救国战争，又给予更加坚决、有力、巨大和有效的支持和帮助。
    接着，越中友好协会会长黄国越在集会上讲话。他在赞扬中国人民十八年来在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就后说：“目前，中国人民正在加倍努力学习毛泽东思想，深入和广泛地在全国范围内进行无产阶级文化大革命，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中积极实现第三个五年计划。”黄国越表示真诚地敬祝中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中和在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，取得更多更大的胜利。

    杨得志说：由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅打破了帝国主义、现代修正主义在我国实现“和平演变”、复辟资本主义的迷梦，而且对正在进行反帝反修斗争的各国革命人民，也是极大的鼓舞和支持。
    杨得志接着热烈赞扬越南人民在伟大的抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌胜利。杨得志说：越南南方和北方人民所取得的伟大胜利，向全世界证明，人民战争是战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效法宝；美帝国主义这个外强中干的纸老虎是完全能够打败的。最后胜利一定是属于英雄的越南人民。杨得志最后说，中越两国是唇齿相依的亲密的兄弟邻邦。中国人民遵循我们伟大的领袖毛主席的教导，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。
