In the Saratov Chemical Combine in the Soviet Union, there are unfinished factory buildings standing like monuments for several years. People have become accustomed to these structures and no longer pay attention to them.

For example, the No. 194 workshop began construction seven years ago. The total construction cost was 214,000 rubles. The remaining unfinished work is worth 75,000 rubles. However, neither the construction workers nor the installation workers can complete this project.

Take the No. 302 workshop as another example. It was completed 97% a year ago, but it has not been put into use to this day. The No. 329 workshop has been under construction for two and a half years, with 95% of the work completed. However, no measures have been taken to complete it.

How did this situation come about? According to the Soviet revisionist press, it is the "fault" of the material incentive system. The construction management department divides the construction work into profitable and unprofitable parts, chasing after the "total amount," so the remaining "unfinished projects" become heavy and unprofitable, and thus they are never completed. The leaders of the construction management department say: "We have completed the plan, and we have also received the banners and bonuses."

    “物质刺激”的恶果
    在苏联萨拉托夫化学联合工厂里，没有完工的厂房象一座座纪念碑一样，耸立了几年了。人们对于这些建筑物已经习以为常，不再注意它们了。
    例如，第一九四号厂房，七年前就开始兴建了。工程的总造价为二十一万四千卢布。剩下来未完成的工程折合七万五千卢布。然而，无论是建筑工人，还是安装工人，都不能完成这项工程。
    再如第三百零二号厂房。还在一年以前就完成了百分之九十七，可是至今也没有交付使用。第三二九号厂房已经建造二年半了，百分之九十五的工程已经完成。但是现在仍没有采取竣工的措施。
    这种现象是怎样造成的呢？据苏修报刊自己供认，这是物质刺激制度的“毛病起了很坏的作用”。建筑管理局把建筑工作分成有利的和没有利的，一味追逐“总额”，因此剩下来的“未完成的工程”就成了繁重的、没有利的，因而也就总完成不了。建筑管理局领导人的说法是：“计划我们全部完成了，奖旗奖金我们也拿到了。”
