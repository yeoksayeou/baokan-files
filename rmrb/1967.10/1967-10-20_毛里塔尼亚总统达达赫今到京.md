Those who welcomed at the airport included leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, responsible officials of the Shanghai Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, Ma Tianshui, Gao Zhirong, and other relevant officials. A group of Red Guards presented the Red Book of revolutionary classics, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," to President Dah Dah and other Mauritanian friends and together recited the teachings of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao: "The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not fear difficulties, and press on bravely. In that case, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

The Shanghai Hongqiao Airport was brightly lit tonight, with red flags flying high, drums beating, and a festive atmosphere.

When the Mauritanian friends met with the welcoming crowd, people held high the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and the portrait of President Dah Dah, waving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and repeatedly shouted: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial struggle of the Mauritanian people!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" President Dah Dah repeatedly waved to the welcoming crowd.
