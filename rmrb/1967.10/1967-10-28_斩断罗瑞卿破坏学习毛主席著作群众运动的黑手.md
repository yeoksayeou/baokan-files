	"In June, the heavenly troops march to exterminate evil, with a ten-thousand-foot rope to bind the rocs."

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing, over the years, in order to realize his treacherous plot to usurp the military and rebel against the Party, with the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, madly opposed our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely resisted Comrade Lin Biao's directive to emphasize politics, and desperately sabotaged our army's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. His political frame-up of our Third Company and our former political instructor Comrade Liao Chujiang is just one of his countless crimes.

	Luo Ruiqing attempted to cut down Liao Chujiang, this advanced model, as a way to resist Comrade Lin Biao and sabotage the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works—a wicked plot.

	Since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the Military Commission, he has always placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all military construction. At the Military Commission's expanded meeting in 1960, which Comrade Lin Biao personally presided over, he called on the entire army to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought," to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." Under Comrade Lin Biao's call, the entire army launched a widespread movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, producing many model units and active individuals who studied well and applied effectively. The leadership of the Shenyang Military Region once conferred on our company the honor of "Vanguard Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Works" and on our former political instructor Comrade Liao Chujiang the honor of "Vanguard in Studying Chairman Mao's Works." Comrade Lin Biao gave high praise to Liao Chujiang, this advanced model. In April 1964, Comrade Lin Biao said: "Introducing Comrade Liao Chujiang's experience in studying Chairman Mao's works will have a great promoting effect on the entire army's study of Chairman Mao's works." He also gave specific instructions: "Use Comrade Liao Chujiang's experience in studying Chairman Mao's works to promote the entire army's study of Chairman Mao's works," "arrange for Comrade Liao Chujiang to go to Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other units to give reports to cadres and soldiers." Comrade Lin Biao's series of instructions pushed the army's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to new heights.

	The further development of the entire army's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works made the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent Luo Ruiqing tremble with fear. They were furious and wailing, like ants on a hot stove, performing one act after another of futile resistance both onstage and backstage. Just as the experience of Comrade Liao Chujiang and others was being promoted, the Chinese Khrushchev insinuated: "Now, studying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has become a form of formalism. If we continue like this, it will lead to deceit. Studying Chairman Mao's works, writing millions of words of notes, absolutely do not promote this." Luo Ruiqing, following his master's orders, immediately summoned Comrade Liao Chujiang and said: "Now, your experience is going to be promoted. Do you know? This year is a year of large-scale military exercises. Military training must be done well. If military training is not done well, how can it be said that you have studied 'Mao's Works' well?" He also, catching wind of rumors, scolded: "Your company's military training is not done well. How can this prove that you, this 'Mao's Works' study activist, are reliable?" Then, taking advantage of Comrade Liao Chujiang going out to give a report, a work team came to our company to investigate. They asked if there was any falsehood in the media's promotion of Comrade Liao Chujiang, if Comrade Liao Chujiang's study experience was really his own summary. To find evidence of "deceit," in addition to comparing the original drafts of Comrade Liao Chujiang's articles with the published articles, they also "experimented" according to Comrade Liao Chujiang's study experience. If they couldn't do it, they said "it can't be done," saying it was false. They went to great lengths, picking bones out of eggs, and not finding any straw in Comrade Liao Chujiang's deeds and experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, they seized on an issue of the company's shooting practice to launch a frenzied attack on Comrade Lin Biao's great call to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, stubbornly pushing the bourgeois military line. In July 1964, a so-called report on the company's military training "deceit" was finally fabricated. Luo Ruiqing immediately personally wrote an "instruction": "The company where Liao Chujiang is located is not solid in military training, has an unhealthy style, openly deceives, and deceives oneself and others, proving that Chairman Mao's works have not been truly studied, and that Mao Zedong Thought is not truly in command." Not only that, he also, in response to Comrade Lin Biao's instruction to "arrange for Comrade Liao Chujiang to go to Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other units to give reports to cadres and soldiers," maliciously attacked in the "instruction": "Liao Chujiang cannot always be away from home, giving reports outside must have a limit." He personally issued an urgent telegram to recall Comrade Liao Chujiang from Guangzhou to the company for "rectification." Then, he also, like a mad dog, rushed to the exhibition of Comrade Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, and Huang Zushi's experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, publicly cursing the company where Comrade Liao Chujiang is located as having "no one who has studied well," and roaring like a demon to "take down" this model of Liao Chujiang. Due to Comrade Lin Biao's warm concern for this exhibition and the revolutionary masses' resolute resistance, Luo Ruiqing's plot did not succeed.

	At this time, Luo Ruiqing was running around everywhere, spreading poison, shouting at the top of his lungs to advocate "weapons plus technology" as combat effectiveness, promoting military technology "experts," touring performances, and pushing for large-scale military exercises. While Luo Ruiqing was arrogantly "restricting" Comrade Liao Chujiang from going out to introduce his experiences, boasting to take down the model of Liao Chujiang, he was also vigorously promoting the Chinese Khrushchev's "Cultivation," falsely claiming that "Cultivation" is a "component of Mao Zedong Thought," issuing notices to call on the troops to study "Cultivation." Luo Ruiqing, this military usurper and anti-Party conspirator, colluded with the Chinese Khrushchev, truly reaching the height of madness. What they hate, what they love, what they want to destroy, and what they want to achieve, isn't it all clear as day!

	Luo Ruiqing, this great conspirator, repeatedly and ruthlessly struck, attempting to cut down Comrade Liao Chujiang, this advanced model of studying Chairman Mao's works, and obstruct our company's study and application of Chairman Mao's works. This was not just aimed at one model and one company. His target was first and foremost our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Comrade Lin Biao, who holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He attempted, through the political frame-up of an advanced model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to sabotage the entire army's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, ultimately achieving his treacherous goal of usurping the military and rebelling against the Party.

	Highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely resist Luo Ruiqing's black instructions, and in a head-on struggle, adhere to Chairman Mao's military line.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Chiang Kai-shek, regarding the people, seizes every inch of power and every inch of benefit. What is our policy? Our policy is to resist head-on and fight for every inch of land." In dealing with such class enemies as the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing, only by engaging in a head-on struggle with him can we thoroughly smash his wicked plots.

	In August 1964, Luo Ruiqing's black instruction arrived at our company, ordering us to immediately carry out "rectification." His so-called "rectification" was to make us train in military technology day and night to achieve his so-called "military solidity." In essence, Luo Ruiqing, this conspirator, was using the emphasis on technology to undermine our resolve to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought" and to dismantle Comrade Liao Chujiang, this advanced model, ultimately to dismantle the soul of our army and further achieve his goal of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

	"The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." After Comrade Liao Chujiang was urgently recalled to the company by Luo Ruiqing, the first thing he did was to vigorously promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application." At that time, the evil wind of large-scale military exercises that Luo Ruiqing had stirred up continued to assault our company. Comrade Liao Chujiang and all the comrades in the company, with their boundless admiration and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, according to the spirit of the Shenyang Military Region Party Committee's instruction to "definitely raise the red flag," engaged in a head-on struggle with Luo Ruiqing. Didn't Luo Ruiqing scold our company for "not being solid in military training," urging us to emphasize military technology? We first discussed in the "rectification" whether to highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and whether to adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, this fundamental issue, and held a great debate, making everyone deeply realize: No matter how important, the most important thing is to highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to Chairman Mao's military line. We also debated what kind of solidity is needed. Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party" and the resolution of the Military Commission's expanded meeting in 1960, we realized: Under the conditions of sharp and complex class struggles both internationally and domestically, we must, as required by the resolution of the Military Commission's expanded meeting, "in great winds and waves, be able to stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and be forever loyal to the cause of communism, loyal to the Party, loyal to the motherland and the people, and loyal to the line of the leader of the Party and the people, Comrade Mao Zedong." This is the true solidity. Through reminiscences and comparisons, everyone further realized: Adhering to emphasizing politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, such a unit is the bravest, most intelligent, most resolute, and most solid. On the contrary, emphasizing technology, relaxing ideological transformation, forgetting class struggle, will make the unit lose its soul. The seventy-three-day "rectification" was a great study and praise of Chairman Mao's military line for us, and also a great accusation and criticism of Luo Ruiqing's reactionary bourgeois military line. The more we studied Chairman Mao's works, the clearer our minds became, the brighter our eyes became, and the more energetic we became; our resolve to build the company with Mao Zedong Thought also became stronger.

	"Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Luo Ruiqing repeatedly attacked and criticized our company for not placing military training in the first position, which precisely proves that we resisted his evil wind of military first and technology first; it proves that we adhered to the "Four Firsts" and achieved results in emphasizing politics. What "solid training" and "healthy style," in the mouths of different classes, have fundamentally different meanings. Luo Ruiqing's so-called solid training is to train a troupe with the skills of "climbing walls and roofs" and "walking on eaves"; Luo Ruiqing's requirement for a "healthy style" is to follow his baton, be good at opportunism, and know how to put on a show. Such "solidity" and such "health" are all black goods of the bourgeois military line, all corrosive agents that poison the soul of our army!

	Didn't Luo Ruiqing want to "restrict" Comrade Liao Chujiang from going out to introduce his experience in studying Chairman Mao's works? Comrade Liao Chujiang and all the comrades in our company also went the opposite way. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Red Army is an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks.... The Red Army's fighting is not just for the sake of fighting, but to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and help the masses build revolutionary political power." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, Comrade Liao Chujiang, with even higher revolutionary enthusiasm and political responsibility, through giving reports, giving books, writing letters, and writing articles, propagated Mao Zedong Thought and exchanged experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. Luo Ruiqing could not "restrict" Comrade Liao Chujiang, nor could he "restrict" every soldier in our company. All the comrades in our company took Comrade Liao Chujiang as an example, learning wherever they went, always studying and propagating the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	In his black instruction, Luo Ruiqing slandered our company as "openly deceiving." This is truly the thief crying "stop thief"! The biggest deception is you, Luo Ruiqing. You arbitrarily decided on large-scale military exercises for the entire army, openly resisted Chairman Mao's line of building the army, assaulted proletarian politics, and attempted to sabotage the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, trying to pull out the soul of our army's construction. If you insist on saying we deceived, now we can clearly tell Luo Ruiqing: There is deception, and that is: your black instruction wanted our company to "rectify" according to your needs of usurping the military and rebelling against the Party, and we did not do this at all. If this is called "deception," then this "deception" is very good! Because this way, we smashed a plot of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing to usurp the military and rebel against the Party, greatly promoted our company's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and was beneficial to the proletarian revolutionary construction of our army and the consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Our company, after experiencing this sharp and intense struggle with the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing, and after more than a year of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, we have a deeper understanding: The boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army, our lifeline. Since our company was established in 1939, we have fought against the Japanese invaders, fought against the Kuomintang bandits, fought in the south and north, participated in more than two hundred battles, and achieved brilliant victories in various aspects such as combat and production. All these victories are the results of insisting on arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Precisely because Mao Zedong Thought is our soul, our lifeline, all military usurpers and anti-Party elements are always scheming to pull out our soul. They are extremely afraid of and hate revolutionary soldiers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and desperately sabotage it. This makes us deeply realize: The class enemy is afraid of this, afraid of that, but they are most afraid of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This combat effectiveness, that combat effectiveness, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the greatest combat effectiveness. In the future, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly achieving: studying Chairman Mao's works without the slightest negligence, executing Chairman Mao's instructions without the slightest deviation, propagating Mao Zedong Thought without the slightest pause, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line without the slightest wavering! We must definitely master Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must enthusiastically respond to the great battle call of our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, to "criticize selfishness and revise revisionism," take "criticize selfishness and revise revisionism" as the guideline, strengthen ideological education, strengthen company construction, use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" in our heads, use Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism, and fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

    斩断罗瑞卿破坏学习毛主席著作群众运动的黑手
    沈阳部队装甲兵某部三连
    “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，多年以来，为了实现他篡军反党的罪恶阴谋，在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，疯狂地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，极力对抗林彪副主席突出政治的指示，拚命破坏我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他对我们三连和三连前任指导员廖初江同志所进行的政治陷害，就是他无数罪行中的一桩。
      罗瑞卿妄图砍掉廖初江这个先进典
  型，是对抗林副主席，破坏活学活用毛主
  席著作的罪恶阴谋
    林副主席主持军委工作以来，始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在我军一切建设的首位。一九六○年林副主席亲自主持召开的军委扩大会议，号召全军“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”，“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”在林副主席的号召下，全军广泛开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，涌现出很多学得好用得好的模范单位和积极分子。沈阳部队领导机关曾经授予我们连队以“学习毛主席著作先锋连”、授予我们连前任指导员廖初江同志以“学习毛主席著作尖兵”的荣誉称号。对于廖初江这个先进典型，林副主席给予高度的赞扬。一九六四年四月，林副主席说：“介绍廖初江同志学习毛主席著作的经验，对全军学习毛主席著作会有很大推动作用。”并且具体指示：“要运用廖初江学习毛主席著作这个典型，来推动全军对毛主席著作的学习”，“要安排廖初江同志去广州、武汉等各部队，在干部、战士中作报告。”林副主席的一系列指示，把部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，推向了新的高潮。
    全军活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的进一步开展，使中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人罗瑞卿怕得要死。他们恼火、哀嚎，象热锅上的蚂蚁一样，台前幕后，演出了一幕幕螳臂挡车的丑剧。正当推广廖初江等同志学习经验的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫含沙射影地说：“现在学习毛选出现了一种形式主义，这样搞下去，会弄虚作假。学习毛主席著作，写千万字的笔记，千万不要宣传。”罗瑞卿秉承主子的旨意，马上召见了廖初江同志，说：“现在要推广你们的学习经验了。你知道吗？今年是大比武的一年，一定要把军事训练搞好。军事训练不搞好，怎么能说明你们对‘毛著’学好了？”他还望风捕影地训斥说：“你们连队的军事训练搞得不好，这怎么能证明你这个‘毛著’学习积极分子过硬？”接着，趁廖初江同志去外地报告的时候，一个工作组来我们连队调查。他们查问报刊上对廖初江同志的宣传有没有虚假？查问廖初江同志的学习经验是不是他自己总结出来的？他们为了找“弄虚作假”的证据，除了要廖初江同志写的文章的原稿和刊出的文章对照以外，还按照廖初江同志谈的学习经验去“试验”，他们做不到的，就说“办不到”，就说是假的。他们煞费苦心，从鸡蛋里挑骨头，没有从廖初江同志活学活用毛主席著作的事迹和经验中捞到什么稻草，便抓住一次连队打靶的所谓“问题”，借题发挥，疯狂地攻击林副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作的伟大号召，顽固地推行资产阶级军事路线。一九六四年七月，一份所谓廖初江所在连队军事训练“弄虚作假”的报告终于炮制出来了。罗瑞卿马上亲自写了“批示”：“廖初江所在连队，军事训练上不过硬，作风上这样不健康，公然弄虚作假，自欺欺人，证明对于毛主席著作并没有真正学好，并不是毛泽东思想真正挂了帅。”不仅如此，他还针对林副主席“要安排廖初江同志去广州、武汉等各部队，在干部、战士中作报告”的指示，在“批示”中恶毒地攻击说：“廖初江也不能总是不在家，外出作报告要有一个限制。”他亲自批发急电，从广州召廖初江同志回连队接受“整顿”。接着，他还象一条疯狗一样窜到廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示学习毛主席著作经验展览馆，公然咒骂廖初江同志所在连队“一个学好的没有”，凶神恶煞似地叫嚷要把廖初江这个典型“拿下来”。由于林副主席对这一展览的亲切关怀和革命群众的坚决抵制，罗瑞卿这个阴谋才没有得逞。
    就在这个时候，罗瑞卿东奔西跑，到处放毒，声嘶力竭地鼓吹“武器加技术”就是战斗力，大树军事技术“尖子”，巡回表演，推行军事技术大比武。罗瑞卿在蛮横地“限制”廖初江同志外出介绍经验，扬言要拿下廖初江这个典型的同时，极力推销中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》，胡说什么《修养》“是毛泽东思想的组成部分”，发通知号召部队学习《修养》。罗瑞卿这个篡军反党的大野心家，同中国赫鲁晓夫狼狈为奸，真是疯狂到了极点。他们恨什么，爱什么，要破坏什么，要实现什么，不是可以看得清清楚楚了吗！
    罗瑞卿这个大阴谋家一而再、再而三地狠下毒手，想砍掉廖初江同志这个学习毛主席著作的先进典型，阻挠我们连队活学活用毛主席著作，决不仅仅是对着一个典型，一个连队。他的矛头首先是对着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对着高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林副主席，他企图通过对一个活学活用毛主席著作先进典型的陷害，来破坏全军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，进而达到他篡军反党的罪恶目的。
      高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决抵制
  罗瑞卿的黑批示，在针锋相对的斗争中，
  坚持毛主席的军事路线
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“蒋介石对于人民是寸权必夺，寸利必得。我们呢？我们的方针是针锋相对，寸土必争。”对待反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿这样的阶级敌人，只有同他进行针锋相对的斗争，才能彻底粉碎他的罪恶阴谋。
    一九六四年八月，罗瑞卿的黑批示发到我们连队，要我们立即进行“整顿”。他的所谓“整顿”，就是要我们白天黑夜地突击技术训练，以便求得他所谓的“军事过硬”。说穿了，罗瑞卿这个阴谋家就是要在突出技术的过程中整掉我们“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的决心，整垮廖初江同志这个先进典型，最后整掉我军的灵魂从而进一步达到他反对毛主席反对毛泽东思想的罪恶目的。
    “人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”廖初江同志被罗瑞卿急电催回连队后，第一件事就是大抓活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。当时，罗瑞卿一手刮起的大比武妖风，继续冲击着我们连队。廖初江同志和全连同志以对伟大领袖毛主席的无限崇拜、无限忠诚，根据沈阳部队党委“一定要把红旗举起来”的指示精神，同罗瑞卿作了针锋相对的斗争。罗瑞卿不是训斥我们连队“军事训练不过硬”，要我们突出军事技术吗？我们在“整顿”中，首先就要不要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，要不要坚持毛主席无产阶级军事路线这个根本问题展开了一次大辩论，使大家深刻认识到：千重要，万重要，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持毛主席的军事路线最最重要。我们还辩论了要什么样的过硬？通过反复学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和一九六○年军委扩大会议决议，我们认识到：在国际国内存在着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的条件下，要象军委扩大会议决议要求的那样：“在大风大浪中能够站稳立场，分清大是大非，永远忠实于共产主义事业，忠实于党，忠实于祖国和人民，忠实于党和人民的领袖毛泽东同志的路线。”这才是真正的过硬。通过回忆对比，大家进一步认识到：坚持突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化，这样的部队就最勇敢，最聪明，最坚决，最过硬。相反，突出技术，放松思想改造，忘记阶级斗争，就会使部队失去灵魂。为时七十三天的“整顿”，是我们对毛主席的军事路线一次大学习、大颂扬，也是对罗瑞卿推行的反动的资产阶级军事路线的一次大控诉、大批判。我们越学毛主席著作，心越明，眼越亮，劲头越足；用毛泽东思想建设连队的决心，也更加坚强了。
      “被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”罗瑞卿一再攻击、指责我们连没有把军事训练放在第一位，这恰恰证明我们抵制了他的军事第一、技术第一的妖风；证明我们坚持了“四个第一”，突出政治作出了成绩。什么“训练过硬”啦，“作风健康”啦，在不同阶级的人嘴中说出来，就有本质不同的含义。罗瑞卿的所谓训练过硬，就是要练成一支具有“爬墙上房”“飞檐走壁”绝技的杂技队；罗瑞卿要求的“作风健康”，就是能够跟着他的指挥棒转，善于投机取巧、会搞一套花架子。这样的“过硬”、这样的“健康”，统统是资产阶级军事路线的黑货，统统是毒害我军灵魂的腐蚀剂！
    罗瑞卿不是要“限制”廖初江同志外出介绍学习毛主席著作的经验吗？廖初江同志和我们全连同志也是反其道而行之。毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。……红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的”。根据毛主席的教导，廖初江同志以更高的革命热情和政治责任感，通过作报告、赠书、回信、写文章等多种形式，宣传毛泽东思想，交流学习毛主席著作的心得。罗瑞卿“限制”不了廖初江同志，也“限制”不住我们全连每一个战士。我们全连同志都以廖初江同志为榜样，走到那里学到那里，时时刻刻学习和宣传伟大的毛泽东思想。
    罗瑞卿在他的黑批示中，栽诬我们连队“公然弄虚作假”。这真是贼喊捉贼！最大的弄虚作假，是你罗瑞卿，你擅自决定全军大比武，公然对抗毛主席的建军路线，冲击无产阶级政治，妄图破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，抽掉我军建设的灵魂。如果硬要说我们弄虚作假，现在我们可以明白地告诉罗瑞卿：“弄虚作假”是有的，这就是：你的黑批示要我们连队按照你篡军反党的需要去“整顿”，我们一丝一毫也没有这样做，如果说这就是“弄虚作假”，那么，这个“弄虚作假”好得很！因为这样做，粉碎了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿篡军反党的一桩阴谋活动，大大促进了我们连队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，有利于我军无产阶级革命化建设，有利于巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
    我们连队经历了同反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿这一场尖锐激烈的斗争，经历了一年多来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，我们更加深刻地体会到：光焰无际的毛泽东思想是我军的灵魂，是我们的命根子。我们连队从一九三九年建连以来，歼日寇，打蒋匪，南征北战，参战二百多次，在战斗、生产等各个方面连续取得了辉煌胜利。这一切胜利，都是坚持用毛泽东思想武装的结果，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。正因为毛泽东思想是我们的灵魂，是我们的命根子，所以一切篡军反党分子总是处心积虑地妄图抽掉我们的灵魂。他们对于革命战士活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计地进行破坏。这使我们更深地认识到：阶级敌人怕这样，怕那样，他们最怕的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这战斗力，那战斗力，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。今后，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，真正作到：学习毛主席著作一字一句不马虎，执行毛主席指示一丝一毫不走样，宣传毛泽东思想一分一秒不停息，捍卫毛主席革命路线一丝一毫不动摇！我们一定要把毛主席关于无产阶级专政下的革命的理论、路线、方针、政策真正学到手。我们一定要最热烈地响应我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号召，以“斗私，批修”为纲，加强思想教育，加强连队建设，用毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，用毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争。我们一定要遵照林副主席的指示，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
