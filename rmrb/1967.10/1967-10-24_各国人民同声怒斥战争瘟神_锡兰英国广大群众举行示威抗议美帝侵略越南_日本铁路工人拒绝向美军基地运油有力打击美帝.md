People in Ceylon and Britain hold demonstrations to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam. Japanese railway workers refuse to transport oil to U.S. military bases, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Colombo on the 22nd, about 2,000 members of the Ceylon Federation of Labor and other groups held a demonstration and rally in Colombo on the 21st to condemn U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

	The demonstrators chanted slogans such as: "Down with U.S. imperialist aggressors!" "U.S. troops out of Vietnam!" "Down with the traitorous Soviet revisionists!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" and so on.

	At the rally held after the demonstration, Sanmugathasan, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Ceylon Communist Party, delivered a speech. He condemned the U.S. aggression in Vietnam and the Soviet revisionist leadership's promotion of the U.S. imperialist's peace talks hoax, betraying the Vietnamese people.

	Sanmugathasan pointed out in his speech that two lessons have been learned in the heroic national liberation struggle of Vietnam. One is that in the struggle against the main enemy—imperialism and reactionaries—it is extremely important to unite all forces that can be united. The other is that no matter how small a country is, if it wages a people's war, it can successfully fight against U.S. aggression.

	Other speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned U.S. aggression in Vietnam and expressed support for the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in London on the 22nd, more than 6,000 people in London held a march and demonstration today to strongly protest against the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam. In the afternoon of the 22nd, demonstrators gathered in Trafalgar Square in the city center and held a large-scale mass rally. They held up many banners with slogans such as: "U.S. butchers out of Vietnam!" "Arrest Johnson, the mass murderer!" "No fake peace talks, U.S. out!" "The U.S. paper tiger is burned to ashes in Vietnam!" "Long live the people's war!" "Victory to the Vietnamese people!" "Wilson, stop supporting U.S. aggression in Vietnam!"

	After the rally, the demonstrators angrily shouted anti-U.S. slogans and marched towards the U.S. Embassy on Grosvenor Square.

	In the march, a group of demonstrators carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao. Many demonstrators, upon seeing Xinhua News Agency reporters and other Chinese personnel during the march, excitedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese people!" Some even waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." After the demonstration reached the vicinity of the U.S. Embassy, several hundred British police, including many mounted police, savagely attacked the unarmed demonstrators. The demonstrators retaliated with stones and other objects, fighting bravely against the police.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, the East Asia News Agency reported that Japanese national railway workers, starting from the night of the 19th, launched a struggle to refuse to transport military fuel to the U.S. military air bases in Tachikawa and Yokota, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in Vietnam.

	This struggle, initiated by national railway workers from Yokohama and Kawasaki, has already stopped the scheduled transport of jet fuel to the Tachikawa and Yokota bases from Yokohama on the 20th and 21st.

	Before the struggle began, the railway workers distributed a large number of leaflets to the public, exposing the crime of the Sato reactionary government in providing Japanese railways for the U.S. imperialists to transport military supplies for the aggression in Vietnam.

	On the evening of the 20th, more than 2,000 railway workers, full of fighting spirit, held a rally at Tachikawa Station. The meeting passed a resolution stating: The U.S. imperialists, who are invading Vietnam, have been defeated by the Vietnamese people's just war and revolutionary war. We oppose the Sato government's participation in the Vietnam War and firmly refuse to transport military supplies for the aggression in Vietnam. The struggle of the railway workers has received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the Japanese people. More than 1,000 students, workers, and peasants rushed to the venue to support the just struggle of the railway workers.

	However, the running dogs of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party, deliberately sent representatives to speak at the meeting to sabotage the railway workers' anti-U.S. struggle. The absurdities of the revisionist clowns aroused the anger of the entire audience. The railway workers shouted: "Shut up!" "Traitors, get out!" Seeing the situation was not in their favor, the revisionist clowns sneaked out of the venue. After the meeting, more than 100 revolutionary youths, riding on trucks, conducted a two-hour propaganda campaign in Tachikawa City. They exposed the crimes of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to the public, receiving waves of applause and cheers. On the same day, a mass rally with 2,000 participants was held in Yokohama City, expressing the determination to continue this anti-U.S. struggle.

    各国人民同声怒斥战争瘟神
    锡兰英国广大群众举行示威抗议美帝侵略越南
    日本铁路工人拒绝向美军基地运油有力打击美帝
    据新华社科伦坡二十二日电　锡兰工会联合会会员等约两千人，二十一日在这里举行示威游行和集会，谴责美帝国主义侵略越南。
    示威者高呼：“打倒美帝国主义侵略者！”“美国军队撤出越南！”“打倒叛徒苏联修正主义！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”“胡志明主席万岁！”等口号。
    在示威游行后举行的集会上，锡兰共产党政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑在会上发表讲话。他谴责美国侵略越南和苏修领导集团兜售美帝国主义的和谈骗局，叛卖越南人民。
    桑穆加塔桑在讲话中指出，在英勇的越南民族解放斗争中得到了两个教训。一个是，在同主要的敌人——帝国主义和反动派——的斗争中，要团结一切可以团结的力量，这是非常重要的。另一个是，不管国家多么小，如果打人民战争，就能够成功地进行反对美国侵略的战争。
    其他与会者在讲话中一致谴责美国侵略越南，并表示声援越南人民的英勇斗争。
    据新华社伦敦二十二日电　伦敦市六千多人今天举行游行示威，强烈抗议美国侵略越南的战争。二十二日下午，示威者聚集在市中心的特拉法加广场，举行声势浩大的群众大会。他们高举许多标语牌，上面写着：“美国刽子手滚出越南去！”“把进行大屠杀的约翰逊抓起来！”“不要假和谈，美国滚出去！”“美国纸老虎在越南被烧成灰烬！”“人民战争胜利万岁！”“胜利属于越南人民！”“威尔逊，停止支持美国侵略越南！”
    会后，示威者愤怒地高呼反美口号，向位于格罗夫纳广场的美国大使馆前进。
    在游行队伍中，一群示威者抬着一张毛主席的巨幅照片。许多示威者在游行途中，看到新华社记者和其他中国人员时都兴奋地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”有些人还挥动着《毛主席语录》。在示威队伍赶到美国大使馆附近后，数百名英国警察，其中包括许多骑警，野蛮地袭击赤手空拳的示威群众。示威者用石块等进行反击，同警察进行了英勇的斗争。
    据新华社二十一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本国营铁路工人从十九日深夜展开的拒绝向立川、横田两个驻日美军空军基地运输军用汽油的斗争，有力地打击了美帝侵略越南的战争政策。
    由横滨和川崎两市国营铁路工人发起的这次斗争，已经使计划在二十日、二十一日两天从横滨运往立川和横田基地的喷气式飞机用的汽油全部停运。
    铁路工人在斗争开始之前，向市民散发了大量传单，揭露佐藤反动政府把日本铁路提供给美帝国主义运输侵略越南的军用物资的罪行。
    二十日晚上，两千多名铁路工人斗志昂扬地在立川车站举行了誓师大会。大会通过决议说：侵略越南的美帝国主义，被越南人民的正义战争、革命战争打得落花流水。我们反对佐藤政府参加侵越战争，坚决拒绝运输侵越军用物资。铁路工人的斗争得到了日本广大人民的热情支持。有一千多名学生、工人和农民赶到会场支持铁路工人的正义斗争。
    但是，美日反动派的帮凶、日共宫本修正主义集团，为了破坏铁路工人的这次反美斗争，特意派代表到会上讲话。日修小丑的谬论，激起了全场愤怒。铁路工人高呼：“住口！”“叛徒，滚蛋！”日修小丑见形势不妙，偷偷地逃出了会场。大会结束后，一百多名革命青年乘着卡车在立川市内进行了两小时的宣传。他们向市民揭露美日反动派的罪行，博得了一阵阵的掌声和叫好。同天，在横滨市举行了有两千人参加的群众大会，表示要把这场反美斗争坚持下去。
