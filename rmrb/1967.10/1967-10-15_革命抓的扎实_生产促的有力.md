The Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the Provincial Military Region held a meeting on "Grasping the Revolution, Promoting Production, and Saving to Make the Revolution"

Revolution grasp is solid, production promotion is powerful

The meeting, held under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adopted a combination of internal and external meeting methods to launch a major exposure, criticism, and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Southwest China and Guizhou. During and shortly after the meeting, more than ten systems under the province either fully or basically achieved revolutionary great unity by department. During the meeting, more than 200 units reported new achievements in production and construction to the conference.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou Province, October 13th — The Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the Provincial Military Region held a meeting on "Grasping the Revolution, Promoting Production, and Saving to Make the Revolution" from September 11th to 20th. This meeting was a rally for the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of the entire province to firmly and swiftly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, accepting Chairman Mao's latest battle orders with the most resolute and swift combat posture. It was also a rally to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution, promote production," and "save to make the revolution," striving to complete the 1967 production and construction plan. Through the great promotion and push of the meeting, a broader and deeper wave of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, and grasping the revolution to promote production is surging across the Guizhou Plateau with the momentum of a thousand horses.

This meeting was held under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the country and Guizhou Province. The good revolutionary situation has brought about a good situation in production and construction. Guizhou Province has achieved a significant increase in summer grain production this year, and the autumn crops are certain to have a bumper harvest. Industrial production from January to July this year has increased by 5.5% compared to the same period last year. Major industrial products such as raw coal and electricity generation have shown steady increases in production. Fiscal and trade revenues and expenditures are balanced, prices are stable, purchases and sales are brisk, and the market is prosperous. Other work has also achieved significant results. The good situation of revolution and production in Guizhou Province is the result of the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of the entire province responding to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Attending this meeting were Red Guards who have made immortal contributions in the Cultural Revolution, PLA soldiers and officers who have established great merits in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, and representatives from various fronts across the province, including workers, peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres, totaling more than 3,000 people.

Representatives from relevant aspects of the proletarian revolutionary masses from sister provinces (autonomous regions) and cities such as Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Kunming, and Chengdu, as well as representatives from the State Council and relevant central departments, also participated in this meeting.

The meeting, based on Chairman Mao's teachings that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and "nothing can be established without destruction," held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, focused on the great criticism of the revolution, and adopted a combination of internal and external meeting methods to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Southwest China and Guizhou. Through three days of major exposure, criticism, and struggle, the meeting criticized their implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line in the economic field, sounding the charge for a revolutionary criticism on the economic front across the province. The criticism at the meeting, broadcast live, reached every corner of the province, forming a new situation where both internal and external meetings criticize and struggle together. External revolutionary masses listened to the live broadcast of the internal criticism and struggle, linked it with their own system and unit situations, and saw that the bourgeois reactionary line was deeply rooted in the economic departments and that the struggle between the two lines was intense. They also clarified the specific content of further carrying out revolutionary criticism in their own units. Many systems, units, and departments of revolutionary masses, through listening to the live broadcast of the meeting, had a deeper understanding of the importance of carrying out revolutionary criticism. Thus, a comprehensive annihilation battle of revolutionary criticism with internal and external unity was launched on the Guizhou Plateau. Medium and small-scale criticism and struggle meetings were held extensively in urban and rural areas. Revolutionary big-character posters columns sprouted like bamboo shoots after a rain, and people criticized verbally and in writing, attacking from various angles the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen. Revolutionary masses said: This meeting is a meeting that emphasizes proletarian politics, a meeting that thoroughly criticizes the bourgeois reactionary line and establishes Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is also a model meeting for criticism and a training class for criticism.

Revolutionary criticism promoted a new leap in revolutionary great unity. During the meeting, internal representatives and external revolutionary masses seriously and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on great unity, further realizing that revolutionary great unity is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, a key to carrying out revolutionary criticism, and an important condition for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Guizhou Cotton Mill, who created the experience of achieving revolutionary great unity by administrative department, systematically introduced their experience of further consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity at the meeting, greatly encouraging the broad proletarian revolutionary masses. During the meeting and the few days after it, systems such as industry, construction, transportation, agriculture and forestry, finance, commerce, propaganda, education, culture, health, and sports under the province either fully or basically achieved revolutionary great unity by administrative department.

Revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great unity promoted a new high tide in production. The broad proletarian revolutionary masses, through revolutionary criticism at the meeting, also listened to the experience of grasping the revolution and promoting production from typical units such as the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, realizing that only by firmly grasping the revolution can production be vigorously promoted, and that it is not possible to ignore the revolution and only focus on production. It should be led by the revolution, commanded by the revolution, and promoted by the revolution. Chairman Mao said: "The correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." The broad revolutionary masses further straightened out the relationship between revolution and production, and their enthusiasm for production was higher. News of completing production plans ahead of schedule, creating new production records, and successfully developing new products kept coming in. During the meeting, more than 200 units reported new achievements in production and construction to the conference. Among them, the Guizhou Cotton Mill created the highest production record since its establishment; the production of Guizhou Coal Mine in September was much higher than in August; the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Guizhou New China Printing Factory smashed the revisionist frameworks, carried out extensive technological innovations, and successfully developed the golden plastic film hot-stamped cover of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" half a month ahead of schedule, and officially put it into production; the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, after seizing power, continuously exceeded the state plan for seven months, and in September not only created a new production record but also successfully developed a new type of diesel engine.

The meeting passed a resolution, calling on the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of the entire province to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, push the revolutionary criticism to a new high tide; through revolutionary criticism, further promote revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and launch a new high tide of grasping the revolution and promoting production. The resolution also called on the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of the entire province to save to make the revolution; to heighten revolutionary vigilance, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat; and to actively carry out activities to support the army and love the people.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Wuhan Small Tractor Factory actively responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp the revolution and promote production," producing more and better tractors for the country.

　　贵州省革命委员会和省军区召开抓革命促生产要节约闹革命会议
　　革命抓的扎实  生产促的有力
　　会议高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，采取会内会外相结合的办法，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西南和贵州的代理人进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。会议期间和会后短短的几天时间内，省属十多个系统，全部或基本上按部门实现了革命大联合。会议期间，有两百多个单位用生产建设新成就向大会报喜。
    据新华社贵阳十三日电　贵州省革命委员会和贵州省军区在九月十一日到二十日召开了抓革命促生产要节约闹革命会议。这次会议是全省无产阶级革命派和革命群众，以最坚定、最迅速的战斗姿态，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，接受毛主席的最新战斗号令的誓师大会；也是最热烈地响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，为完成一九六七年生产建设计划而奋斗的誓师大会。通过会议的大促进、大推动，一个更广泛、更深入的革命大批判、革命大联合和抓革命促生产的新高潮，正以万马奔腾之势，在贵州高原全面掀起。
    这次会议是在全国和贵州省无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下召开的。革命的大好形势，带来了生产建设的大好形势。贵州省今年夏粮获得大增产，秋季作物丰收已成定局。工业生产，一月至七月的总产值，比去年同期增长百分之五点五。主要工业产品，如原煤、发电量等，产量稳步上升。财政贸易收支平衡，物价稳定，购销两旺，市场繁荣。其他各项工作也都取得较大成绩。贵州省出现的这一派革命、生产的大好形势，是全省无产阶级革命派和革命群众响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，狠抓革命、猛促生产的结果，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    出席这次会议的有在文化大革命中立下不朽功勋的红卫兵小将，有在“三支”“两军”工作中建立了丰功伟绩的解放军指战员，有来自全省各地各个战线的工人、农民、民兵和革命干部的代表，共三千多人。
    湖北、湖南、广东、广西、四川、云南、武汉、广州、重庆、昆明、成都等兄弟省（自治区）、市无产阶级革命派有关方面的代表和国务院、中央有关部门的代表，也参加了这次会议。
    会议根据毛主席的“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”和“不破不立”的教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓紧革命的大批判，采取会内会外相结合的办法，向中国赫鲁晓夫以及他在西南、贵州的代理人发起了猛烈的攻击。会议通过三天的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，清算了他们在经济领域里推行的资产阶级反动路线，在全省吹响了经济战线革命大批判的进军号。会议上的大批判，通过实况广播，传遍了全省各个角落，形成会内会外一起批判，一起斗争的新局面。会外广大革命群众收听会内批判斗争的实况广播，联系本系统、本单位的情况，既看到了经济部门的资产阶级反动路线流毒很深，两条路线斗争很激烈，又明确了本单位进一步开展革命大批判的具体内容。不少系统、单位和部门的革命群众，通过收听会议实况，对开展革命大批判的重要意义有了进一步的认识。于是，一个会内会外大联合的革命大批判的歼灭战，在贵州高原全面打响了。中小型的批判会、斗争会，在城乡各地普遍举行。革命的大字报专栏，如雨后春笋，人们口诛笔伐，从各个角度向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙猛烈开炮。革命群众说：这次会议是突出无产阶级政治的会议，是大破资产阶级反动路线、大立毛泽东思想、大立毛主席革命路线的会议，也是大批判的样板会、大批判的训练班。
    革命的大批判，促进了革命大联合的新飞跃。会议期间，会内代表和会外革命群众认真地反复地学习了毛主席关于大联合的最新指示，进一步看清了革命大联合是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要内容，是搞好革命大批判的关键，是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的重要条件。创造按行政部门实现革命大联合经验的贵阳棉纺厂的无产阶级革命派代表，在会上系统地介绍了他们进一步巩固和发展革命大联合的经验，给广大无产阶级革命派很大鼓舞。在会议期间和会后的短短几天内，省属工业、建筑、交通、农林、财政、贸易、宣传、教育、文化、卫生、体育等系统，都全部或基本上按行政部门实现了革命大联合。
    革命大批判和革命的大联合促进生产出现了新高潮。广大无产阶级革命派在会议上通过革命的大批判，又听了贵州柴油机厂等一些典型单位的抓革命、促生产的经验介绍，认识到只有狠抓革命才能猛促生产，不能不管革命只抓生产，应该以革命来带头，来挂帅，来促进生产。毛主席说：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”广大革命群众进一步摆正了革命和生产的关系，生产干劲更高，提前完成生产计划、创造生产新纪录和试制新产品成功的喜讯不断传来。仅会议期间用生产建设新成绩向大会报喜的单位就有两百多个。其中，贵阳棉纺厂创造了建厂以来的最高生产纪录；贵阳煤矿九月份的产量超过八月份很多；贵州新华印刷厂无产阶级革命派打碎了修正主义的条条框框，大搞技术革新，提前半个月试制成功了金光闪闪的塑料薄膜烫金的《毛泽东选集》封面，并且正式投入了生产；贵州柴油机厂的无产阶级革命派夺权后，连续七个月超额完成国家计划，九月份不仅创造了生产新纪录，还制成功一种新品种柴油机。
    会议通过决议，号召全省无产阶级革命派和革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把革命的大批判推向新高潮；通过革命的大批判，进一步促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，掀起抓革命促生产新高潮。决议还号召全省无产阶级革命派和革命群众要节约闹革命；提高革命警惕，巩固和加强无产阶级专政；大力开展拥军爱民活动。（附图片）
