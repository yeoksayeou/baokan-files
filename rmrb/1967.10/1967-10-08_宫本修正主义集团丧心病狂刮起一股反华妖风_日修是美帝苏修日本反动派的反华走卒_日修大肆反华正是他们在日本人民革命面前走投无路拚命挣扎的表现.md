The revisionist gang of Komoto has gone mad, whipping up an anti-China storm. The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) is a lackey of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Japanese reactionaries in their anti-China activities. The JCP's frenzied anti-China campaign is a desperate struggle in the face of the Japanese people's revolution.

New China News Agency, October 7 -- Our correspondent reports: In recent days, the revisionist gang of Komoto has used the issue of recalling JCP representatives Sun Jian Liang and Gan Yao Chun Yi from China to stir up trouble and launch a frenzied anti-China campaign. This has once again exposed them as lackeys of U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Soviet revisionist clique, and as a bunch of traitors to the Japanese people.

The revisionist gang of Komoto's publications, including "Red Flag," "Vanguard," "Economy," "Worker-Peasant Movement," "Study," and "Road of Democratic Literature," have, after Sun Jian Liang and Gan Yao Chun Yi left China, followed a single tune and published numerous anti-China articles.

The gang's organ, "Red Flag," not only continuously published the portraits of Sun and Gan and spread groundless anti-China rumors, but also published a long and stinking anti-China editorial on August 21. This editorial openly attacked the great leader of the Chinese and world peoples, Chairman Mao, defamed Mao Zedong Thought, cursed the great Communist Party of China, and viciously attacked the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guard movement in China. They ranted about "extreme great-nation chauvinism" and "extreme left opportunism," truly maddened to the extreme.

It is worth noting that the anti-China rhetoric used by the Komoto gang is exactly the same as that used by the Soviet revisionist clique in attacking China. This once again shows that they are merely playing the role of the Soviet revisionists' lackeys.

In this anti-China storm whipped up by the Komoto revisionist gang, all their lackeys, big and small, have joined in. They have incited the prefectural and county committees and grassroots organizations they can still control to continuously issue so-called "protests" and "condemnations" regarding the issue of Sun and Gan, and even hold meetings, making a big fuss. They have twisted black and white, claiming that the recall of Sun and Gan was a "precedent-setting atrocity in the international communist movement" fabricated by the Communist Party of China.

On August 5, the propaganda chief of the Komoto gang led a small group of people to hold a press conference and issued a "protest" from the "JCP Central Committee," inciting their lackeys to direct their attacks at the Communist Party of China.

On October 3, Ye Ban San San, at a so-called "welcome" meeting for the "JCP representatives recalled by the JCP leadership from China," used extremely vicious lies to slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This once again exposed the Komoto leadership's traitorous face as lackeys of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries in their anti-China activities.

Opposing China inevitably means supporting the U.S., and the Komoto revisionist gang's intensified anti-China campaign has completely torn off the last shred of cover they had, claiming to be "anti-imperialist" and "anti-revisionist." The editorial published by "Red Flag" in praise of the counter-revolutionary summit between the U.S. and Soviet leaders in Glassboro, sang the tune of U.S. imperialism, claiming that the U.S. is "initiating cooperation and reconciliation with China," and defended the crimes of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, saying, "We cannot agree with viewing the Soviet leadership as a complete ally of U.S. imperialism, saying that this summit is a conspiracy between the two sides to sell out Vietnam and the peoples of the world." Look, what a disgusting lackey's face!

The Komoto gang's desperate struggle to act as lackeys of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists in their anti-China activities is a sign of their desperation in the face of the revolutionary wave of the Japanese people. They thought that by doing so, they could get out of their predicament, but the result is the opposite. The Komoto gang's criminal actions have further educated the Japanese people from the opposite side. As the revolutionary faction of the JCP said: "Komoto Aizhi is afraid of U.S. imperialism, afraid of war, afraid of suppression, abandons revolution, colludes with Soviet revisionism, and has degenerated into an anti-China vanguard and a lackey of U.S. imperialist aggression, betraying the Japanese people and the peoples of Asia." This is the conclusion drawn by the revolutionary people of Japan about the Komoto revisionist gang.

    宫本修正主义集团丧心病狂刮起一股反华妖风
    日修是美帝苏修日本反动派的反华走卒
    日修大肆反华正是他们在日本人民革命面前走投无路拚命挣扎的表现
    新华社七日讯　本社记者报道：最近以来，宫本修正主义集团利用它们召回日共驻中国代表砂间一良和《赤旗报》驻北京记者绀野纯一的问题，兴师动众，大肆反华，再一次暴露了它们是美日反动派和苏修集团的帮凶，是背叛日本人民的一小撮叛徒。
    宫本修正主义集团的《赤旗报》、《前卫》、《经济》、《工人农民运动》、《学习》、《民主主义文学之路》等刊物，在砂间一良和绀野纯一离开中国以后，都按照一个调调，连篇累牍地发表反华文章。
    它的机关报《赤旗报》，不仅接连刊载砂间和绀野的头像，不断发表纯系造谣的反华言论，而且在八月二十一日还发表一篇又臭、又长的反华社论。这篇社论，公然指名攻击中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席，诋毁毛泽东思想，咒骂伟大的中国共产党，恶毒攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动。它们胡说什么中国是“极其高傲的大国沙文主义、极左机会主义”等等。这真是丧心病狂到了极点。
    值得指出的是，宫本集团在这里所使用的反华滥调同苏修集团攻击中国时使用的滥调，完全一样，这再一次说明它们所扮演的只不过是苏修应声虫的可耻角色而已。
    宫本修正主义集团在它掀起的这次反华妖风中，调动了大小娄罗，一齐上阵。它唆使它们还能够调动的都道府县委员会和基层组织，就砂间和绀野问题，接连不断地发表所谓“抗议”、“谴责”，以至举行集会，吵吵闹闹。他们为了反华的目的而召回砂间和绀野，却颠倒黑白地说成是什么中共制造的“国际共产主义运动中史无前例的暴行”等等。
    八月五日，宫本集团的宣传部长带领了一小撮人，举行记者招待会，发表“日共中央”的“抗议”，煽动娄罗们把攻击矛头集中指向中国共产党。
    十月三日，野坂参三在所谓“欢迎”被日修领导集团召回的“日共驻中国代表”的大会上，使用极其恶毒的谰言，诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命。这就又一次暴露了日修领导集团充当美帝、苏修和日本反动派反华走卒的叛徒面目。
    反华必然降美，宫本修正主义集团加紧反华，把它过去打着的那一点点“反帝、反修”的遮羞布完全扯掉了。《赤旗报》在颂扬美苏首脑葛拉斯堡罗反革命黑会时所发表的社论，唱起美帝国主义的调子，胡说什么美帝是“倡议对中国合作和和解”的，并且为美帝、苏修的罪行辩解说：“把苏联领导视为美帝国主义的完全同盟者，说这次首脑会谈是双方勾结起来出卖越南以及世界各国人民的阴谋”，“我们是不能同意的”。请看，这是一副多么令人作呕的奴才相！
    宫本集团这样不遗余力地充当美苏反华帮凶，正是它们在日本人民革命浪潮面前走投无路，拚命挣扎的表现。它们以为这样就可以使它们摆脱困境，但是结果适得其反。宫本集团的罪恶行径进一步从反面教育了日本人民，正如日共革命派所说：“宫本显治害怕美帝国主义，害怕战争，害怕镇压，放弃革命，和苏联修正主义狼狈为奸，堕落成为反华尖兵和美帝国主义侵略的帮凶，背叛了日本人民和亚洲人民”。这就是日本革命人民给宫本修正主义集团所作的结论。
