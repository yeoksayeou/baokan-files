Recently, the revolutionary cultural and sports troops of the PLA units stationed in Beijing, the revolutionary committee of the Beijing Military Region's Art Troupe, and the temporary preparatory committee have, with boundless love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, modified and rehearsed the five-act play "Huaishu Zhuang" in a fighting posture. The newly revised "Huaishu Zhuang," based on the original play, highlights the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, it uses vivid and typical artistic images to deeply expose and criticize the evil plots of the clique of capitalists within the party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and their social base in the countryside—the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The vivid summary, deep exposure, and merciless criticism make this play like a sharp dagger, piercing deeply into the black hearts of the Chinese Khrushchev. The performance of this play timely and forcefully supports the current nationwide criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev, providing profound education.

"Never Forget Class Struggle"

In 1957, our great leader Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of ownership, class struggle has not ended." "The question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." In 1962, Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, issued the great call: "Never forget class struggle."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev openly opposed the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, madly shouting: "After the completion of the three transformations, class struggle has basically ended, and there are no longer classes and class struggle in our country." "Capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants will all enter socialism." He vigorously advocated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, directly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The essence of this struggle reflects the fundamental issue of whether it is proletarian dictatorship or bourgeois dictatorship.

Has class struggle really ended? Have the overthrown landlords and capitalists resigned themselves to their defeat? No! It is not like that at all! The typical facts of the extremely sharp class struggle in China's countryside from the land reform to the eve of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as described in "Huaishu Zhuang," strongly refutes the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev. Let us listen to a speech by Guo Dama, a poor peasant in the play! She says: "You may think that the landlords' land has been confiscated, but their reactionary thoughts have not been eliminated. Take Cui Laogun for example; he always thinks about the Nationalists, longs for Chiang Kai-shek, and spreads rumors everywhere to sabotage our socialism and our cooperatives." The facts are exactly like this. The last scene of the play cleverly adds a segment where Cui Zhiguo erects a monument for his deceased landlord father, immediately reminding one of the Chinese Khrushchev's erection of a monument and biography for the big capitalist in Tianjin (his stinking father-in-law). The two are contrasted, showing that the Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Cui Zhiguo are all filial sons and grandsons of the landlord and capitalist classes.

"Only Socialism Can Save China"

Chairman Mao said: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, with each family being a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, making the peasants themselves fall into perpetual poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only road to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." "Only socialism can save China."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev openly advocates the "three horses, one plow, one cart" economy of rich peasants, promoting individual farming, and striving to drag China backward.

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line represents the fundamental interests of hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants. In the revised "Huaishu Zhuang," the dialogue between Guo Dama and Cui Zhiguo reflects the sharp struggle between two classes and two roads.

Cui Zhiguo: (smiling) I ask you, what do you call this socialism? Do you have tractors? Do you have power stations?

Guo Dama: We have the leadership of the Party! We have Chairman Mao! As long as we poor and lower-middle peasants are united, organize, and run the cooperatives well, forever following Chairman Mao, we can advance to socialism! Advance to communism!

Cui Zhiguo: ...I think Man Cang is the direction, just to engage in individual farming, "three horses, one plow," and get rich.... If eighty percent of the households in Huaishu Zhuang have "three horses, one plow," life will be better!

Guo Dama: Where did you get this idea? If we really do as you say, the poor will become poorer, the rich will become richer, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will have to beg for food and be exploited again. Won't that be back to the old society? Is this your father's opinion?

Cui Zhiguo: No, no, no! He doesn't have such a high level. This is said by a big figure, but my father also agrees with his opinion....

Guo Dama: Oh, this big figure and the landlords and capitalists are in cahoots....

Guo Dama's words expose the Chinese Khrushchev's evil plot to restore the capitalist system. People clearly see that the reactionary fallacies of the class enemy Cui Zhiguo come from the Chinese Khrushchev.

However, the sabotage of the class enemy and the opposition of the Chinese Khrushchev cannot stop the wheel of history. The cooperative led by Guo Dama, after sharp and complex struggles, advances along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, from the original dozen or so households to occupying more than ninety percent of the households in Huaishu Zhuang.

"A New High Tide of the Socialist Mass Movement is About to Arrive"

Just as the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants across the country were brewing to establish agricultural production cooperatives, Chairman Mao first foresaw: "A new high tide of the socialist mass movement is about to arrive." However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in collaboration with the ghosts and snakes in society, blew up one gust of evil wind after another, singing the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, saying things like "the cooperatives are a mess, established too early, rushed ahead." They madly opposed the so-called "rush ahead" and viciously cut down 200,000 cooperatives.

The newly revised "Huaishu Zhuang" truly reflects this sharp struggle. The off-stage Deng Secretary is the representative figure of those who insist on taking the capitalist road. He obstructs and strangles the development of the cooperatives in every possible way. Just as the masses' hands and feet are tied, and the cooperatives are suppressed, Guo Dama returns from a meeting in Beijing. She brings back our great leader Chairman Mao's new instructions on the cooperatives. Chairman Mao said: "One wants to dismount, and one wants to mount, but this shows the divergence of the two lines." "In the countryside across the country, a new high tide of the socialist mass movement is about to arrive."

Chairman Mao's words are like a thunderbolt from the sky, shattering the Chinese Khrushchev's beautiful dream of restoring capitalism in the countryside. Chairman Mao's words are like a lighthouse with boundless flames, illuminating the poor and lower-middle peasants' path forward. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, Huaishu Zhuang sees a high tide of agricultural cooperatives, followed by strides forward on the broad road of people's communes.

    毛主席革命路线的颂歌
    ——评新改编的话剧《槐树庄》
　　任卫东
    最近，陆海空三军驻京部队无产阶级革命派文体战士联合演出委员会、北京部队战友文工团革命委员会临时筹委会的文艺战士们，怀着对毛主席革命路线的无限热爱和对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，以战斗的姿态，修改、排练了五幕话剧《槐树庄》。新改编的《槐树庄》，在原剧的基础上突出了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，用典型生动的艺术形象，深刻地揭露和批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们在农村的社会基础——地、富、反、坏、右，牛鬼蛇神，在农村妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。形象的概括，深刻的揭露，无情的批判，使这个戏如同一把锋利的匕首，狠狠扎进中国赫鲁晓夫的黑心。这个剧的上演，及时有力地配合了目前全国对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判大斗争，给人深刻的教育。
    “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”
    一九五七年，我们伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：在所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后“阶级斗争并没有结束”。“社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”一九六二年，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，又发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。
    可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫公然反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，疯狂叫喊：“三大改造完成以后，阶级斗争基本结束，在我国再也没有阶级和阶级斗争了。”“资本家、地主、富农都将进入社会主义。”极力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，直接同毛主席的革命路线相对抗。这一斗争的实质，反映了是要无产阶级专政还是要资产阶级专政的根本问题。
    阶级斗争真的结束了吗？被推翻的地主、资产阶级就甘心于他们的失败了吗？不！完全不是那样！《槐树庄》所描写的我国农村从土地改革到无产阶级文化大革命前夜的极其尖锐的阶级斗争的典型事实，有力地回击了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论。让我们听听剧中贫农郭大娘的一段话吧！她说：“你别看地主的地被没收了，可是他们的反动思想没有被消灭，就拿崔老昆来说吧，天天想着国民党，盼着蒋介石，到处造谣破坏我们的社会主义，破坏我们的合作社。”事实正是如此。这个戏最后一场巧妙地增加了崔志国给死了的地主老子树碑一段戏，这马上使人想到中国赫鲁晓夫给天津大资本家（他的臭丈人）树碑立传一事，两相对照，中国赫鲁晓夫和崔志国之流都是地主阶级、资产阶级的孝子贤孙。
  “只有社会主义能够救中国”
    毛主席说：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”“只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    而中国赫鲁晓夫却公然提倡“三马一犁一车”的富农经济，鼓吹单干，极力把中国拖向后退。
    毛主席的革命路线代表了亿万贫下中农的根本利益。在改编后的《槐树庄》中，郭大娘和崔志国的一段针锋相对的对话，反映了两个阶级和两条道路的尖锐斗争。
    崔志国：（笑）我问你，你这叫什么社会主义？你们有拖拉机吗？有水电站吗？
    郭大娘：我们有党的领导，我们有毛主席！只要我们贫下中农一条心，组织起来，办好合作社，永远跟着毛主席走，我们就能走到社会主义！走到共产主义。
    崔志国：……我看满仓那倒是个方向，就是要搞单干，搞“三马一犁”，搞发家致富。……槐树庄有百分之八十的农户都有三马一犁，那日子就好过啦！
    郭大娘：你这一套是哪来的？真要照你说的这样干，那穷的更穷，富的更富，贫下中农还得讨吃要饭受剥削，那不又回到旧社会去了？这是你爹的意见吧？
    崔志国：不，不，不！他那有这么高的水平，这是一个大人物说的，不过我爹也很同意他的意见。……
    郭大娘：噢，这个大人物和地主、资本家穿一条裤子。……
    郭大娘一针见血地戳穿了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义制度的罪恶阴谋。人们清楚地看到，阶级异己分子崔志国的反动谬论，来自中国赫鲁晓夫。
    然而，阶级敌人的破坏，中国赫鲁晓夫的反对，拖不住时代的巨轮。郭大娘领导的合作社，经过尖锐复杂的斗争，沿着毛主席的革命路线前进，由原来的十几户，发展到占槐树庄农户的百分之九十几了。
    “新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来”
    正当全国农村亿万贫下中农酝酿大办农业生产合作社的时候，毛主席首先预见到：“新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来。”然而中国赫鲁晓夫配合社会上的牛鬼蛇神又刮起一股又一股的妖风，同毛主席的革命路线大唱反调，说什么“合作社办糟了，办早了，冒进了。”疯狂地反所谓“冒进”，恶毒地砍掉了二十万个合作社。
    新改编的《槐树庄》真实地反映了这一尖锐的斗争，没有出场的邓书记就是坚持走资本主义道路的代表人物，他百般阻挠和扼杀合作化运动的发展。正当群众的手脚受到束缚，合作化运动遭到压制的时候，郭大娘从北京开会回来了，她带来了我们伟大领袖毛主席对合作化运动的新的指示。毛主席说：“一个要下马，一个要上马，却是表现了两条路线的分歧。”“在全国农村中，新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来。”
    毛主席的话就象劈天巨雷，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在农村复辟资本主义的美梦。毛主席的话，就象光焰无际的灯塔，照亮了贫下中农前进的航程。槐树庄在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，出现了农业合作化高潮，接着又在人民公社化的康庄大道上阔步前进。
