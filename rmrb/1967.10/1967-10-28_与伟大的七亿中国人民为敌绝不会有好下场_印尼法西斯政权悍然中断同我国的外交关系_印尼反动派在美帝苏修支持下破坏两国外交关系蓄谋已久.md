The Indonesian fascist regime, led by Suharto and Nasution, brazenly severed diplomatic relations with our country after armedly attacking the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on October 1st, committing a shocking fascist atrocity. It then took a series of despicable actions, trampling on the basic principles of international relations, and abruptly ending diplomatic ties with China.

The Indonesian reactionary government's note to the Chinese government on October 23rd exposed its ugly face as a running dog of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The note announced the closure of the Indonesian Embassy in China and the withdrawal of all personnel. The note even arrogantly and unreasonably demanded that the Chinese government close the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, the Consulate General in Jakarta, and the Consulates in Medan, Makassar, and Surabaya by October 30th, and withdraw all embassy and consulate personnel, thereby severing the relations between the two countries.

Subsequently, the official mouthpiece of Indonesia, Antara News Agency, Jakarta Radio, and right-wing newspapers went into a frenzy of anti-China hysteria, falsely accusing China of "sabotaging" the relations between the two countries and loudly proclaiming that the Indonesian reactionary government had "closed" its embassy in China.

This vicious anti-China act was meticulously orchestrated by the likes of Suharto and Nasution. On October 9th, an emergency meeting of the "Cabinet Chairman's Committee" convened by Suharto specifically plotted the conspiracy to sever diplomatic relations with China. On that day, the Indonesian fascist military regime sent a note to the Chinese government and issued an anti-China statement, announcing the severance of diplomatic relations with China.

The anti-China statement, while announcing the withdrawal of all personnel from the Indonesian Embassy in China, said in an extremely arrogant manner: "The Chinese government must withdraw all personnel from the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta. Only after receiving a report from the Indonesian diplomatic personnel in Beijing that they have safely arrived in Hong Kong or Dhaka, will the Indonesian government allow Chinese planes to land in Jakarta."

To create a pretext, the statement went to great lengths to distort facts, slandering the Chinese government and accusing China of "violating the traditions and customs of civilized countries," making the personal safety of the Indonesian diplomatic personnel in China "unsecured." It even shamelessly lodged a "strongest protest" against the Chinese government.

It is said that this anti-China statement was a response to the relevant note that the Chinese government recently sent to the Indonesian reactionary government regarding the anti-China atrocities committed by the Indonesian fascist military regime. It is well known that on October 1st, the Indonesian fascist military regime dispatched a large number of armed military police and over a thousand thugs to attack and completely destroy the Chinese Embassy, injuring and beating 20 staff members, including the Chargé d'Affaires Huang Wensheng, in the process. This created a rare fascist atrocity in the history of international diplomatic relations. In response, the Chinese government sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on October 5th, lodging the strongest and most urgent protest against the Indonesian fascist government, and decided to immediately dispatch a special plane to Jakarta to bring back the Chargé d'Affaires and other seriously injured personnel.

However, this reasonable demand by the Chinese government was met with an unreasonable rejection by the Indonesian fascist government. The anti-China statement said: "The Indonesian government will not allow the Chinese special plane to enter Indonesian territory." It is clear that the Indonesian fascist government has been trying every possible means to force the Chinese government to withdraw all personnel from the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, in order to achieve its evil goal of sabotaging the relations between the two countries.

Anti-China and anti-Chinese, sabotaging relations between the two countries, have been a consistent policy of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime to curry favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Recently, the anti-China actions of this fascist regime have become even more brazen. Not long ago, Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik, who had held secret talks with U.S. Secretary of State Rusk and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko in New York, returned to Jakarta with a highly arrogant anti-China attitude. When he met with the leaders of the reactionary student organizations that attacked the Chinese Embassy, he launched a vicious attack on China for allegedly engaging in "subversive activities" in Indonesia and openly declared: "We will move towards severing (diplomatic relations with China)." Later, Malik told the press in Jakarta: "What we are doing is trying to sever (relations with China)." He admitted: "Severing (relations with China) began when the Indonesian government ordered the recall of its personnel from Beijing on August 24th this year."

While sabotaging diplomatic relations with China, the Indonesian fascist government has become even more blatant in its collusion with the public enemy of the Chinese people—the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. It is reported that when Malik returned to Jakarta via Hong Kong from the United States, he had a "meeting" with the Third Director of the Kuomintang Central Committee, Ma Shuli. Upon his return to Jakarta, Malik boasted, "If Taiwan claims to be the Republic of Taiwan, Indonesia can recognize it." According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency on October 10th, Ma Shuli expressed his joy over the Indonesian fascist government's decision to sever diplomatic relations with China, saying that this "increased" the possibility of Indonesia establishing diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang.

These circumstances indicate that the Indonesian fascist military regime's announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with China was a long-planned conspiracy. This reactionary regime, supported by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is so reckless and crazy in its opposition to the great seven hundred million Chinese people that it will not end well. Like all reactionaries, the more it intensifies its anti-China actions, the faster it will hasten its own doom!

### 与伟大的七亿中国人民为敌绝不会有好下场  印尼法西斯政权悍然中断同我国的外交关系  印尼反动派在美帝苏修支持下破坏两国外交关系蓄谋已久

    与伟大的七亿中国人民为敌绝不会有好下场
    印尼法西斯政权悍然中断同我国的外交关系
    印尼反动派在美帝苏修支持下破坏两国外交关系蓄谋已久
    新华社二十七日讯　雅加达消息：以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权在十月一日武装袭击中国驻印尼大使馆，制造了骇人听闻的法西斯暴行后，又采取了一系列卑劣的手段，践踏国际关系的起码准则，悍然中断同中国的外交关系。
    印尼反动政府十月二十三日给中国政府的照会，是它充当美帝苏修反华走狗的丑恶面目的大暴露。照会宣布关闭印尼驻华大使馆，撤走全部人员。照会甚至狂妄地无理限定中国政府在十月三十日以前关闭中国驻印尼大使馆、驻雅加达总领事馆和驻棉兰、马辰、锡江等地领事馆，撤回使领馆全部人员，从而中断了两国关系。
    随后，印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社、雅加达电台和右派报纸反华歇斯底里大发作，反诬中国“破坏”两国关系，并大肆宣扬印尼反动政府已经“关闭”了它的驻华大使馆。
    这一恶毒的反华行径是苏哈托、纳苏蒂安之流一手精心制造的。十月九日，由苏哈托召集的“内阁主席团”紧急会议专门策划了同中国中断外交关系的阴谋。这一天，印尼法西斯军人政权给中国政府发了个照会，并且发表反华公报，宣布中断同中国的外交关系。
    反华公报在宣布撤走印尼驻华大使馆全体人员的同时，极端横蛮地说：中国政府“必须撤走在雅加达的全部中国大使馆人员。只有在接到印尼驻北京外交官员关于他们已安全抵达香港或达卡的报告之后，印尼政府才能准许中国飞机在雅加达着陆。”
    为了制造借口，公报极尽颠倒黑白之能事，对中国政府大肆造谣中伤，攻击中国“违背文明国家的传统和习惯”，使印尼驻华使馆人员的“个人安全没有保证”。它甚至厚颜无耻地向中国政府提出“最强烈抗议”。
    据称，这个反华公报是回答中国政府最近就印尼法西斯军人政权制造的反华暴行交给印尼反动政府的有关照会。众所周知，十月一日，印尼法西斯军人政权出动大批武装军警和一千多名暴徒，武装袭击和彻底破坏了中国大使馆，当场枪伤、打伤中国临时代办黄文胜等全馆二十名同志，制造了国际外交关系史上罕见的法西斯暴行。对此，中国政府于十月五日照会印尼驻华大使馆，向印尼法西斯政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议，并决定立即派专机前往雅加达，接回中国临时代办和其它重伤人员。
    但是，中国政府的这一合理要求却遭到印尼法西斯政府的无理拒绝。反华公报说：“印尼政府不会允许中国专机进入印尼境内”。十分明显，印尼法西斯政府早就千方百计迫使中国政府撤回中国驻印尼大使馆全部人员，以达到它破坏两国关系的罪恶目的。
    反华排华，破坏两国关系，是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权为了讨好美帝苏修而采取的一贯政策。最近，这个法西斯政权的反华行径更加变本加厉。不久前在纽约同美国国务卿腊斯克和苏联外交部长葛罗米柯举行过密谈的印尼外交部长马利克在回到雅加达后，反华气焰十分嚣张。他在接见袭击中国大使馆的反动学生组织头目时，大肆攻击中国在印尼搞“颠覆活动”，并且毫不掩饰地叫嚷：“我们将向（同中国）中断外交关系的方面走去”。接着，马利克在雅加达对报界说：“我们正在干的是设法（同中国）中断关系”。他承认：“中断（同中国）关系，是在（今年）八月二十四日印尼政府下令从北京召回它的人员的时候开始的”。
    印尼法西斯政府在破坏同中国的外交关系的同时，更加明目张胆地同中国人民的公敌——蒋介石匪帮加紧勾结。据透露，马利克从美国返回雅加达路过香港时，曾同蒋帮国民党中央委员会第三主任马树礼“会晤”。回到雅加达后，马利克就扬言，“如果台湾自称是台湾共和国，印尼可以承认它”。据蒋帮中央社十日报道，马树礼对印尼法西斯政府决定同中国中断外交关系表示高兴，说这“增加了”印尼同蒋帮“建立外交关系的可能性”。
    这些情况表明，印尼法西斯军人政权宣布中断同中国的外交关系，完全是蓄谋已久的。美帝苏修支持下的这个反动政权如此一意孤行，疯狂地与伟大的七亿中国人民为敌，是绝不会有好下场的。同一切反动派一样，它越是加紧反华，就越要加速它自己的灭亡！
