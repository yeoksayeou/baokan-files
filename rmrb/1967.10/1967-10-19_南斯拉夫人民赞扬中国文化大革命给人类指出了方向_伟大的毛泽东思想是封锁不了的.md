	Yugoslav people praise China's Cultural Revolution for showing the way for humanity
	The great Mao Zedong Thought cannot be blocked

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade: As the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution achieves victory after victory, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is spreading more and more widely among the Yugoslav working people. Despite the Tito clique's every effort to obstruct and block it, the awakening Yugoslav people's strong desire for Mao Zedong Thought is something that can never be blocked.

	Whether in the capital Belgrade or in other towns, Chinese comrades often encounter ordinary Yugoslav workers, peasants, and young students expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in various ways.

	In Zrenjanin, about seventy kilometers from Belgrade, once people discovered that Chinese comrades were wearing Chairman Mao's badges, many rushed forward, earnestly asking Chinese comrades for them and actively inquiring about the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction. Many people exposed the Yugoslav newspapers' deceitful propaganda about the Chinese Cultural Revolution, praising "the Red Guards' actions are very good," "China is building true socialism." At that time, the public's actions in Yugoslavia aroused extreme hatred and panic from the Tito clique. Just as Yugoslavs were asking Chinese comrades for Chairman Mao's badges, the Tito clique's armed police rushed out, twisting and beating those who were asking for Chairman Mao's badges. A beaten youth angrily cursed the police, saying, "German fascists!"

	At the fruit and vegetable exhibition held in Novi Sad, despite the presence of plainclothes agents keeping watch, many visitors, service staff, and salespeople still went up to the Chinese comrades who came to visit and asked for Chairman Mao's badges.

	In the capital Belgrade, once, a few car repair workers saw Chinese comrades driving, and they immediately put down their work, shouting "badges" "badges" and gesturing with their hands over their chests. The Chinese comrades immediately stopped the car and fulfilled their wishes, giving each of them a Chairman Mao badge. These workers all showed immense happiness.

	On an early autumn day, a couple of unemployed workers brought a pot of "evergreen grass" to visit Chinese friends. They excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is truly a great leader, he truly cares for the people and guides the people correctly, the Chinese people are truly blessed." When leaving, the wife of the unemployed worker handed the "evergreen grass" to the Chinese friends with both hands and said, "Wish Chairman Mao Zedong eternal life!"

	The Tito traitor clique fiercely attacks and slanders the unprecedented Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, but the Yugoslav working people sincerely praise the Cultural Revolution, saying, "It's done well!" "Very well!"

	A worker from Montenegro who came from Slovenia angrily denounced the dark society under the rule of the Tito traitor clique to Chinese friends and enthusiastically praised New China and the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "Our country's leaders are exploiters, oppressors, parasites." This worker went on, "What socialist society of national equality? Where is the equality, it's all deception." He sighed, "Our country has no socialism, only capitalism." He showed great concern for the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution and excitedly said, "What China is doing is exactly what we are pursuing, this is true socialism." The proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in China "is a great cause, it has the same great significance as the October Revolution in Russia, it shows the way for humanity." This worker expressed great indignation at the Tito clique's rampant anti-China and opposition to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, saying, "We workers will no longer allow them to continue doing this."

　　南斯拉夫人民赞扬中国文化大革命给人类指出了方向
    伟大的毛泽东思想是封锁不了的
    据新华社讯  贝尔格莱德消息：随着中国无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在南斯拉夫劳动人民当中的传播日益广泛。尽管铁托叛徒集团百般阻挠、封锁，但是，觉醒中的南斯拉夫人民向往毛泽东思想的强烈愿望是永远也封锁不了的。
    无论在首都贝尔格莱德，还是在其他城镇，中国同志经常会遇到南斯拉夫的普通工人、农民、青年学生通过各种方式表达他们对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限热爱。
    在距贝尔格莱德七十多公里的兹雷尼亚宁市，有一次，很多人发现中国同志胸前佩戴中国人民和世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席的像章，于是纷纷走向前去，恳切地向中国同志索取，并主动地询问中国无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的情况。不少人向中国同志揭露南斯拉夫报纸对中国文化大革命的欺骗宣传，赞扬“中国红卫兵的行动好得很”、“中国在建设真正的社会主义”。当时，南斯拉夫公众的这一行动引起铁托集团的极端仇视和恐慌。正当南斯拉夫人向中国同志索取像章时，铁托集团的武装警察慌忙出来，对向中国同志索取毛主席像章的人又扭又打。一位被打的少年激愤地痛骂警察说：“德国法西斯！”
    在诺维萨特举行的水果、蔬菜展览会上，尽管有便衣特务盯梢监视，但是不少参观的人、服务员、售货员还是向前来参观的中国同志索取毛主席像章。
    在首都贝尔格莱德，有一次，几名修理汽车的工人看到中国同志开车，他们马上放下手中的活，一面大声喊着“像章”“像章”，一面用手在胸前比划着。中国同志立即停车，满足了他们的愿望，每人送了一枚毛主席像章。这几位工人都流露出无比幸福的感情。
    初秋的一天，一对失业工人夫妇手捧一盆“长青草”特意探望中国朋友。他们激动地说：“毛主席真是一位伟大的领袖，他真正关心人民，正确地教导人民，中国人民真幸福。”临走时，失业工人的妻子双手把“长青草”送给中国朋友，并说，“祝毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”
    铁托叛徒集团拚命攻击诬蔑毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，但是，南斯拉夫劳动人民却由衷地赞扬文化大革命“搞得好！”“好得很！”
    一位来自斯洛文尼亚的黑山族工人向中国朋友愤怒控诉铁托叛徒集团统治下的黑暗社会，热情赞扬新中国和中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说：“我们国家的领导人是剥削者、压迫者，是寄生虫。”这位工人接着说：“什么社会主义社会的民族平等？哪里有平等，这都是欺骗。”他感叹地说：“我们国家没有社会主义，只有资本主义。”他对中国无产阶级文化大革命表示极大关心，并激动地说：“中国正在做的一切，也正是我们所追求的理想，这才是真正的社会主义。”中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命“是伟大的事业，它具有同俄国十月革命一样的伟大意义，它给人类指出了方向。”这位工人对铁托集团猖狂反华和反对中国文化大革命的罪行表示极大愤慨，他说：“我们工人不会再允许他们继续这样干下去。”
