The great 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is upon us. This year's National Day celebration is different from the past seventeen years. This year is the year in which our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, the year in which Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victories, and the year in which the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong have been even more deeply ingrained in people's hearts!

Our great leader Chairman Mao, with the highest genius and greatest courage in human history, personally initiated and led the people of the entire country in launching an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launching a total offensive against the Chinese Khrushchev. In just over a year, the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev has crumbled, and Khrushchev-like figures have been one by one exposed, no longer able to wreak havoc as they did in the past.

A year ago, we poor and lower-middle peasants, the revolutionary masses, followed our great leader Chairman Mao in making revolution, bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, and tempering ourselves in the storm of class struggle. Currently, the winds of great revolutionary unity are blowing strongly, and our revolutionary ranks are even more vast and mighty.

Through more than a year of struggle, especially since the launch of the revolutionary criticism campaign, we have clearly recognized that the "mechanization first, then collectivization" and "three autonomies and one contract" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev are all aimed at promoting his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, all aimed at undermining the collective economy, restoring capitalism in China, and making us poor and lower-middle peasants slaves again. We poor and lower-middle peasants must fight them to the end, and we will not rest until we thoroughly criticize and expose them!

Over the past year, we have smashed one plot after another by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and have raised even higher the banners of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "be thrifty and make revolution." With unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm and production fervor, we have achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production.

Over the past year, in the soul-stirring Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants have also made significant achievements in our struggle to transform our thinking. In the struggle, we have continuously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles," using the great thoughts of Mao Zedong as our weapon, fiercely fighting against selfishness, and firmly establishing public spirit. We care about national and international affairs, actively participating in the revolutionary criticism campaign, and bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production.

The achievements of the past year are the great victories of the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong, the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the victories of the hard struggle of the revolutionary masses under the leadership of Chairman Mao! We poor and lower-middle peasants must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, carry out the revolutionary criticism campaign even more deeply, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, develop and consolidate the great revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must better "grasp revolution, promote production" and "be thrifty and make revolution," ensuring that production is good, harvesting is good, seed selection is good, procurement is good, distribution is good, and storage is good, striving for an all-around bumper harvest this year and laying the foundation for a bumper harvest of summer grains next year.

    突出无产阶级政治　保证做到“农业六好”
　　北京市农代会常设委员会
    伟大的中华人民共和国十八周年国庆节日来到了。今年过国庆，和过去十七年不同。今年是我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一年，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得决定性胜利的一年，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想更加深入人心的一年！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席以人类历史上最高的天才，最大的魄力，亲自发动和领导全国革命人民，开展了空前未有的无产阶级文化大革命，向中国的赫鲁晓夫发起了总攻击。时间仅仅过去了一年零几个月，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部就土崩瓦解了，赫鲁晓夫式的人物一个一个被揪了出来，他们再也不能象过去那样猖獗一时了。
    一年前，我们贫下中农无产阶级革命派紧跟伟大领袖毛主席闹革命，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副担子，在阶级斗争的风暴中锻炼成长。目前，革命大联合的东风劲吹，我们的革命队伍更是浩浩荡荡。
    经过一年多来的斗争，特别是开展革命的大批判以来，我们清楚地认识到中国的赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“先机械化后合作化”和“三自一包”等等，都是为了推行他的反革命修正主义路线，都是为了瓦解集体经济，在中国复辟资本主义，使我们贫下中农重新做牛马。我们贫下中农一定要和他们斗争到底，不把他们彻底批倒、批臭，誓不罢休！
    一年多来，我们击溃了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一个又一个阴谋诡计，更高地举起“抓革命，促生产”“要节约闹革命”的旗帜，用无比高涨的革命干劲和生产热情，夺取了农业生产的大丰收。
    一年多来，在触及灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们贫下中农改造思想的斗争，也取得了很大成绩。我们在斗争中不断活学活用毛主席著作，特别是“老三篇”，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，关心国家大事、世界大事，积极投入了革命大批判的斗争，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。
    一年多来的成就，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛主席领导下亿万革命群众艰苦斗争的胜利！我们贫下中农一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，更深入开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，发展、巩固革命的大联合和“三结合”，巩固无产阶级专政。我们一定要更好地“抓革命，促生产”“要节约闹革命”，保证做到：生产好，收割好，选种好，征购好，分配好，保存好，争取今年全面丰收，并为明年夏粮丰收打下基础。
