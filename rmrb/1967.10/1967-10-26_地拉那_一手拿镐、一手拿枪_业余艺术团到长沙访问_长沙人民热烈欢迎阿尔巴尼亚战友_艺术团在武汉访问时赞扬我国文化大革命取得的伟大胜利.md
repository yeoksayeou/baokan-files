The "Pickaxe in One Hand, Gun in the Other" amateur art troupe from Tirana arrived in Changsha for a visit this morning. Over 500 revolutionary cultural workers, PLA cultural warriors, and Red Guards from Changsha greeted the Albanian comrades enthusiastically. They held high portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as Chairman Mao's quotations, and beat drums and gongs to welcome the Albanian friends. The Chinese and Albanian comrades stood shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, and sang revolutionary songs together, repeatedly shouting with great joy: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

This afternoon, the Albanian comrades visited the Hunan First Normal School, where our great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, once studied and engaged in revolutionary activities. The Albanian comrades enthusiastically visited the exhibition hall of Mao Zedong's revolutionary activities in his youth and the dormitory where he stayed during his revolutionary activities. By the well where Chairman Mao used to take cold baths to strengthen his body and willpower, many Albanian comrades were deeply moved and eagerly tried the well water, feeling very close to it. Before leaving, the art troupe performed Albanian songs and dances full of fighting spirit and revolutionary friendship for the Red Guards and revolutionary students.
