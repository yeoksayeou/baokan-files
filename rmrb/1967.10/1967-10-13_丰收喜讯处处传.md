In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Hebei Province, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, used revolutionary criticism and self-criticism as a driving force, overcame drought, wind, hail, pests, and waterlogging disasters, and achieved a bumper autumn harvest.

Currently, from the Great Wall inside and outside to the banks of the Zhang River in Hebei Province, harvest news is spreading everywhere. The province's more than 50 million mu of early autumn crops have been harvested, and late autumn crops are gradually coming in. From the harvesting situation in various places, it can be seen that the main grain crops such as sorghum, corn, millet, and buckwheat are all bumper harvests. The total grain output of the province has increased significantly compared to previous years. This year, the per-mu yield of cotton in the province has also exceeded any previous year. Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with a spirit of not fearing fatigue and continuous fighting, are urgently harvesting late autumn crops, plowing and harrowing wheat fields, and rushing to sow winter wheat, laying a solid foundation for next summer's bumper harvest.

Historically, Hebei Province, which has been short of grain, has achieved a bumper autumn harvest this year. This is the result of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres firmly implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, eliminating selfishness and promoting public interests, and advancing the revolutionization of people's thinking. It is a major achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Henan Province Reports Significant Increases in Grain, Cotton, and Tobacco Leaf Production

Following the summer bumper harvest, Henan Province has reported another bumper autumn harvest. Currently, the province's early autumn crops have been harvested, and late autumn crops are gradually coming in. According to the actual harvest situation in various places, the per-unit area yield of grain, cotton, and tobacco leaf has increased significantly compared to last year. Many regions have seen increases in grain, cotton, and tobacco leaf yields that have exceeded any previous year. The broad masses of rural commune members enthusiastically acclaim that this autumn's bumper harvest is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad masses of commune members are very enthusiastic about delivering grain and cotton. The Nanyang Special District, which completed the grain procurement task ahead of schedule this summer, is preparing to deliver an additional 200 million jin of surplus grain to the state this autumn. By September 20, the province had procured 16% more cotton and 20% more tobacco leaf than the same period last year. The procurement volume of hemp, sesame, and oak silkworms has also increased compared to previous years.

In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's continuous victories, Sichuan Province, one of China's major grain-producing areas, has reported inspiring news: following the bumper harvest of small spring crops, the province's autumn grain crops have also achieved a bumper harvest. Currently, except for sweet potatoes which are being rushed to harvest, the province's more than 60 million mu of rice and corn have been basically harvested, with a total output exceeding last year. Some places have achieved the best harvest in history. The broad masses of farmers are actively selecting and drying grain and enthusiastically delivering it to the state.

Sichuan Province's bumper autumn grain harvest is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a rich fruit of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and a result of the People's Liberation Army's strong support.

　　丰收喜讯处处传
　　河北主要粮食作物样样收成好
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，河北省广大贫下中农和革命干部，以毛泽东思想为武器，以革命大批判为动力，战胜了旱、风、雹、虫、涝灾，夺取了秋季大丰收。
    目前，河北省北起长城内外，南至漳河沿岸，到处传来丰收喜讯。全省五千多万亩早秋作物已收割完毕，晚秋作物也陆续登场。从各地已经收打的情况看，高粱、玉米、谷子、莜麦等主要粮食作物都是丰收，全省粮食总产量比往年有较大的增长。今年全省棉花的亩产量也超过了历史上任何一年。现在，广大贫下中农和革命干部，正以不怕疲劳和连续作战的革命精神，紧张地收割晚秋作物，耕耙麦地，抢种冬麦，为明年夏季大丰收打下坚实的基础。
    历史上缺粮的河北省，今年获得秋季大丰收，是广大贫下中农和革命干部坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，促进人的思想革命化的结果，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大成就。
　　河南粮棉烟叶产量大幅度增长
    河南省继夏季大丰收之后，又传来了秋季全面大丰收的喜讯。目前，全省的早秋作物已经收割完毕，晚秋作物正在陆续登场。据各地的实收情况来看，粮食、棉花、烟叶等作物的单位面积产量都比去年有较大幅度的增长。不少地区的粮食作物、棉花、烟叶的增产幅度都超过了以往任何一年。广大农村社员热烈欢呼，今年秋季的全面大丰收是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    广大社员缴售粮、棉非常踊跃。今年夏季超额完成粮食征购任务的南阳专区，秋季准备增售给国家余粮两亿斤。到九月二十日，全省已征购的棉花比去年同期增加百分之十六，已征购的烟叶比去年同期增加百分之二十，大麻、芝麻、柞蚕的收购量都比往年增加。
　　四川水稻玉米总产量超过去年
    在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，我国主要产粮区的四川省传出了振奋人心的喜讯：全省继小春作物丰收以后，今年秋季粮食作物又获得丰收。目前，除甘薯正在大力抢收外，全省六千多万亩水稻、玉米已基本收割完毕，总产量超过了去年，有些地方取得了历年未有的好收成。广大农民正在积极选晒粮食，踊跃向国家交售。
    四川省今年秋季粮食作物获得丰收，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是广大贫下中农和革命干部认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的丰硕成果，也是人民解放军大力支援的结果。
