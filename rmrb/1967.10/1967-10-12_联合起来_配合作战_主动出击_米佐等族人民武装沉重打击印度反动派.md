	Unite, Coordinate, Take the Initiative
	Mizo and Other Tribal Armed Forces Heavily Strike Indian Reactionaries

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, New Delhi: The Mizo people's armed forces, who are fighting for national liberation, have recently been frequently taking the initiative to launch attacks, eliminating Indian reactionary military and police forces. They recently killed and wounded 160 reactionary military and police personnel.

	The Mizo people's armed forces, equipped with rifles and machine guns seized from the enemy, have recently often ambushed reactionary police motor patrols on mountain roads and then moved to uninhabited valleys. Despite the Indian reactionary government's large-scale manhunts, they have not achieved their counter-revolutionary goals. By dusk, the Mizo people's armed forces almost controlled the entire inhabited areas of Mizo.

	The Mizo and Naga armed forces, active in the northeastern Indian states of Assam, Nagaland, and Manipur, have recently made significant developments. They coordinate their actions and have united with the Kukis and Zeliang tribes in this region to jointly carry out armed struggles for national liberation. In late July, these four tribes united to fight two brilliant battles in the Tamenglong area of Manipur, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indian reactionary army. These two large-scale joint operations shook the rule of the reactionary government in the Manipur region.

　　联合起来　配合作战　主动出击
    米佐等族人民武装沉重打击印度反动派
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：正在为争取民族解放而战斗的米佐族人民的武装力量，近来频繁地主动出击，消灭印度反动军警。他们最近又打死、打伤反动军警一百六十名。
    用从敌人手里缴获的步枪和机枪武装起来的米佐族人民的武装力量，最近经常在山路上伏击反动警察部队的摩托车巡逻队，然后转移到没有人烟的峡谷去。尽管印度反动政府发动了大规模搜捕，都未达到其反革命的目的。每到黄昏，米佐族人民的武装力量就几乎控制了整个米佐的有人居住地区。
    活跃在印度东北部阿萨姆邦、那加兰邦和曼尼普尔地区的米佐族、那加族武装最近有了重要的发展。他们互相配合作战，并且和这个地区的库基族、泽良族联合起来，共同开展争取民族解放的武装斗争。七月下旬，这四个部族联合起来，在曼尼普尔的塔门隆地区打了两次漂亮仗，使印度反动军队遭受重大伤亡。这两次大规模的联合作战，震撼了曼尼普尔地区反动政府的统治。
