	By the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville), Prime Minister and Head of Government Ambroise Noumazalaye-led delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement and Government of Congo (Brazzaville) visited the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition this morning.

	Accompanying the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends on their visit were Vice Premier Li Xiannian, leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee Ma Tian-shui, and Deputy Foreign Minister Xu Yixin.

	Upon arrival at the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, Noumazalaye and other Congolese (Brazzaville) friends were warmly welcomed by the exhibition staff. Before the visit, the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends and the exhibition staff together studied Chairman Mao's quotation: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot depend on it. We rely on our own efforts and the creative power of the entire army and people."

	The exhibition staff enthusiastically introduced to the Congolese (Brazzaville) guests how the Shanghai working class, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works, carries forward the spirit of self-reliance, strives for progress, and works hard to overcome various difficulties, creating many high-level precision products. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers further aroused their enthusiasm, and under Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," they achieved even greater successes. Noumazalaye carefully observed various exhibits and happily said, "I hope you will continue to act according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. By following the path of self-reliance, you will surely achieve your set goals."

	The Congolese (Brazzaville) Ambassador to China, Bazanga, also visited the exhibition.
