Listen! The voices of Soviet workers and youth are denouncing the privileged class as "millionaires," "parasites," and "foremen."

Under the rule of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, many enterprise managers in the Soviet Union have become new capitalists. They treat factories as their own "territory," acting tyrannically and doing as they please. The broad masses of Soviet workers are cruelly oppressed and exploited by the privileged class, and they see more clearly the exploitative nature of this small group of privileged individuals. They express strong indignation and resistance against their crimes.

Two young Soviet technical workers said: "Our leaders are all officials who act like lords. They sit in their offices all day, talking big, and don't care about the workers' lives. They have betrayed Lenin's teachings. When Lenin was alive, he organized voluntary labor on Saturdays and led by example."

An old worker with thirty years of experience said: "We have many millionaires here. We workers count every kopeck, even when eating we have to calculate whether to spend an extra kopeck, but these people don't care about rubles. They have nothing in common with us, not even in language."

A worker from Leningrad angrily said: "Eighty-five percent of our factory's profits go to the officials, and we dare not speak out."

According to the *Komsomolskaya Pravda*, a worker exposed that the factory's leaders forced workers to falsify records and cheat for bonuses. He said, "If you dare to criticize the leaders, they will find fault with you and punish you. Whoever stands up for justice will suffer." The workers are very indignant that the higher-ups and the factory directors are in cahoots, shielding the directors' illegal activities. An old worker from an Armenian sock factory complained about the director's illegal occupation of housing without punishment, saying, "Does the law not apply to directors at all?" Many factory workers pointed out bluntly that their enterprise leaders are "parasites," "foremen," and "oppressors" of the workers.

The broad masses of Soviet youth strongly protest against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's betrayal of Lenin's cause and the restoration of capitalism.

A student from Moscow University said: "The Soviet Union is now a capitalist country. High-salaried people live better than Western capitalists, and all the factories and enterprises in the country are in their hands. Ordinary people, however, live in poverty, even worse than during the tsarist era. I have argued with my father about these issues. He, of course, does not agree with my views because he is also an exploiter. I rarely associate with him."

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist privileged class against the broad masses of people can only arouse the people's revolutionary struggle.

    听！苏联工人和青年的声音
    怒斥特权者是“百万富翁”、“寄生虫”、“工头”
    在勃列日涅夫—柯西金之流统治下的苏联，许多企业负责人已经变成了新的资本家，他们把工厂当作自己的“领地”，横行霸道，为所欲为。苏联广大工人群众受特权阶层的残酷压迫和剥削，对这一小撮特权者的剥削阶级面目看得越来越清楚，对他们的罪行表示强烈的愤慨和反抗。
    有两位苏联青年技术工人说：“我们的领导都是当官做老爷，他们整天坐在办公室里高谈阔论，不管工人的死活。他们背叛了列宁的遗训。列宁在世时，还组织星期六义务劳动，并且亲自带头。”
    一位有三十年工龄的老工人说：“我们这里有好多百万富翁。我们工人用钱是一个戈比一个戈比计算的，连吃饭时都得计算要不要多花一个戈比，可是，这些人把卢布都不当回事。他们跟我们不仅在生活上，而且在语言上也没有什么共同的东西。”
    列宁格勒一位工人愤怒地说：“我们的工厂百分之八十五的利润属于当官的，我们敢怒不敢言。”
    据《共青团真理报》透露，一工人揭露工厂的领导人强迫工人弄虚作假、骗取奖金时说，谁要向领导提意见，“他就会找你的岔，找借口来处罚你”，“谁出来主持正义，谁就倒霉”。工人群众对上级与厂长一鼻孔出气，包庇厂长的不法行为非常愤慨。亚美尼亚共和国一织袜厂老工人对厂长强占住房不受惩罚不平地说，“难道所有的法律对厂长都不起作用吗？”许多工厂的工人一针见血地指出，他们企业的领导人是“寄生虫”、“工头”，是压迫工人的“统治者”。
    苏联广大青年对苏联修正主义统治集团背叛列宁的事业，实行资本主义复辟表示强烈的抗议。
    莫斯科一大学的学生说：“苏联现在已经是一个资本主义国家。高薪的人生活得比西方资本家还好，整个国家的工厂、企业都在他们手中。而普通人却生活得很贫困，甚至比沙皇时代还坏。关于这些问题，我与父亲辩论过，他当然不同意我的观点，因为他也是一个剥削者，我与他很少来往。”
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。苏修特权阶层对广大人民犯下的种种罪行，只能激起人民的革命斗争。
