Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.”

Chairman Mao also teaches us: “Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles.”

Chairman Mao’s latest instructions have greatly inspired the working class and the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. The trend towards revolutionary great unity is irresistible.

The arrival of the revolutionary great unity high tide once again proves: once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become an inexhaustible material force.

The working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, is at the forefront of revolutionary great unity, setting an example for the proletarian revolutionary cadres across the nation.

Chairman Mao points out that the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, “has become the most conscious part of the people, the leader of the Chinese revolution.” The working class has the farthest vision, is selfless, highly organized, disciplined, and thoroughly revolutionary, serving as the leading force of the Chinese revolution and the proletarian cultural revolution. When the working class unites, it can more effectively concentrate its strength, focus its targets, deepen the revolutionary criticism, and improve the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. It can also better implement Chairman Mao’s great policy of “grasp revolution, promote production,” vigorously promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

The revolutionary great unity of the working class is the backbone of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary cadres across the nation. When the working class unites, it can greatly resist the impact of petty-bourgeois factionalism, rally all revolutionary forces around itself, and use its exemplary actions to promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary cadres. Practice has proven that in regions where the working class unites well and takes the lead, the proletarian revolutionary cadres also unite well, and the proletarian cultural revolution can develop smoothly.

The revolutionary great unity of the working class is achieved through “criticizing oneself and opposing revisionism,” and it can only be consolidated and developed through “criticizing oneself and opposing revisionism.” The working class, with its heavy responsibilities, must, after uniting, resolutely implement Chairman Mao’s great policy of “criticizing oneself and opposing revisionism.” It must play a model and leading role in consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity.

Consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity will further advance the struggle between proletarian thought and bourgeois thought, and between socialist public interests and bourgeois individualism. China was originally a country with a large petty-bourgeois population. Although our industry has long been socialized and our agriculture has long been collectivized, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts will still infiltrate the working class through various channels. Within the working class, there will inevitably be a struggle between public and private interests. Chairman Mao says: “The working class must transform the entire society in class struggle and in the struggle against nature, and in doing so, it also transforms itself.” After uniting, the working class must further study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and strive to transform its worldview. At the same time, with its actual actions, it must struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in society, overcome the vacillation of petty-bourgeois elements, guide petty-bourgeois thoughts onto the track of proletarian revolution, and transform our world according to the proletarian worldview.

Organizational unity within the working class must be guaranteed by ideological unity. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the great unity of the working class. If organizational factionalism is eliminated but ideological factionalism still prevails, with “self” as the guiding principle, then there will still be a discrepancy between form and substance. Only by establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought can the great unity of the working class have a common ideological foundation. We must unswervingly use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts and actions of the entire class. A great unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought is the most solid and indestructible.

The working class unites to present a united front against the enemy and to jointly oppose revisionism. The working class is the most resolute in revolution, has the firmest stance, and the clearest banner. In the struggle against the enemy, it stands at the forefront. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are the agents of the bourgeoisie within the party and are the sworn enemies of the working class. If we do not thoroughly criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and if we do not completely overthrow them, then capitalism will have the opportunity to restore itself, and the working class will be thrown back into the abyss, suffering twice. Thoroughly criticizing China’s Khrushchev and his agents means uprooting the poisonous roots of counter-revolutionary revisionism in all fields and on all fronts, eliminating the influence of bourgeois thought, and removing those old things that do not fit the socialist economic base. This is in the fundamental interests of the working class. After uniting, the working class must spare no effort to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionism represented by China’s Khrushchev, combining the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. Based on the specific situation of the unit, it must actively carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, leading the proletarian revolutionary cadres to carry the struggle against revisionism to the end.

The working class can only eliminate internal disagreements without principles in the struggle against revisionism, becoming more conscious and deeply aware of its great historical mission. With one heart and one mind, and with collective wisdom and strength, it can unite more closely, further consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity.

The revolutionary great unity of the working class is a heavy blow to the domestic and foreign class enemies. The class enemies are most afraid of the unity of the working class. They always attempt to use more concealed and vicious means to split the ranks of the working class and sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. This is their arrogant wish. In the triumphant song of revolutionary great unity, we must remember Chairman Mao’s teachings, never forget class struggle, strengthen our awareness of the enemy, and timely expose and smash the plots of the class enemies.

The great unity of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, driven by the great unity of the working class, is promoting a new upsurge in the proletarian cultural revolution and a great leap forward in socialist construction.

Long live the revolutionary great unity of the working class!

　　工人阶级联合起来
　　《红旗》杂志评论员
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”
    毛主席又教导我们：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合，只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”
    毛主席的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了工人阶级和无产阶级革命派。革命大联合的趋势，是不可阻挡的。
    革命大联合高潮的到来，又一次证明了：毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的物质力量。
    具有光荣革命传统的工人阶级，走在革命大联合的最前头，为全国无产阶级革命派树立了榜样。
    毛主席指出，中国工人阶级，在中国共产党的领导下，“成了全国人民中最有觉悟的部分，成了中国革命的领导者”。工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富有组织性、纪律性和革命的彻底性，是中国革命的领导力量，也是无产阶级文化大革命的领导力量。工人阶级联合起来，就可以更有效地集中力量，集中目标，深入开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，巩固和发展革命的“三结合”，就可以更好地贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，大力促进工农业生产的发展。
    工人阶级的革命大联合，是全国无产阶级革命派大联合的骨干力量。工人阶级联合起来，就能够极大地抵制小资产阶级派性的冲击，把一切革命力量紧紧地团结在自己的周围，用自己的模范行动，去促进无产阶级革命派的大联合。实践证明，那一个地区的工人阶级联合得好，起了带头作用，那一个地区的无产阶级革命派就联合得好，无产阶级文化大革命就能顺利发展。
    工人阶级的革命大联合，是在“斗私，批修”中实现的，也只有在“斗私，批修”中，才能得到巩固和发展。工人阶级身负重任，联合起来以后，要坚决贯彻毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大方针，要在巩固和发展革命大联合中，起模范作用，带头作用。
    巩固和发展革命的大联合，将继续更好地开展无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争，社会主义的公和资产阶级个人主义的私的斗争。中国原来是一个小资产阶级众多的国家。虽然我们的工业早已实现社会主义的国有化，农业早已实现社会主义的集体化，但是，资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想，还会通过各种渠道，不断地侵蚀工人阶级的肌体。在工人阶级队伍中，也必然存在公和私两种思想的斗争。毛主席说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。”工人阶级联合起来后，要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，逐步克服自己的缺点，努力改造世界观。同时，以自己的实际行动，同社会上的资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想作斗争，克服小资产阶级的摇摆性，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来，按照无产阶级世界观来改造我们的世界。
    工人阶级组织上的联合，要有思想上的联合来保证。毛泽东思想是工人阶级大联合的灵魂。如果组织上铲除了小山头，思想上还是“私”字当头，派性作怪，那就还会貌合神离。只有树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，工人阶级大联合才有共同的思想基础。我们要坚定不移地用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，统一整个阶级的思想，统一整个阶级的行动。建立在毛泽东思想原则基础上的大联合，是最牢固的，任何力量破坏不了的。
    工人阶级联合起来，是为了一致对敌，共同批修。工人阶级革命最坚决，立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明，在对敌斗争中站在最前列。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是资产阶级在党内的代理人，是工人阶级的死对头。如果不把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批透、批臭，不把他们彻底打倒，那么，资本主义就会有复辟的可能，工人阶级就会被重新打入深渊，受二遍苦。彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，就是在各个领域中，各条战线上，挖掉反革命修正主义的毒根，肃清资产阶级思想的影响，去掉那些不适合社会主义经济基础的旧东西。这是工人阶级的根本利益。工人阶级联合起来以后，就要全力以赴，狠批以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义，把革命大批判和本单位斗、批、改结合起来，根据本单位的具体情况，积极搞好本单位的斗、批、改，带动无产阶级革命派把批修斗争进行到底。
    工人阶级只有在批修斗争中，才能消除内部的无原则分歧，更自觉地、更深刻地认识自己的伟大历史使命，同心同德，群策群力，更紧密地团结起来，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合。
    工人阶级的革命大联合，是对国内外阶级敌人的沉重打击。阶级敌人最害怕工人阶级的团结，他们总是妄图用更加隐蔽、更加毒辣的手段，来分裂工人阶级的队伍，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。这是他们的狂妄想法。在革命大联合的凯歌声中，我们要牢记毛主席的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，加强敌情观念，及时地识破和粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋。
    由工人阶级大联合所带动的无产阶级革命派的大联合，正在促进无产阶级文化大革命的新高涨，促进社会主义建设的大飞跃。
    工人阶级革命大联合万岁！
