The Soviet revisionist *Komsomolskaya Pravda* once published an article titled "Do Not Be Arrogant About Communism," spreading absurd fallacies to Soviet youth, claiming that the task of youth is "to study." Whether it is bourgeois or proletarian culture, it supposedly does not matter. Exposed, their intention is to make youth shut themselves in to study, not to care about national and international affairs, as if to say, "Two ears do not hear what is outside, one heart only reads the classics." They aim to erode the revolutionary will of Soviet youth, to lure youth into focusing only on professional skills, not on politics, and to detach them from real class struggle. They do not want proletarian dictatorship; they want bourgeois dictatorship.

The great Lenin once said that the task of youth is "to study." However, this original meaning has been obviously distorted and mutilated by the Soviet revisionist gang of traitors. In "The Tasks of the Youth League," Lenin clearly pointed out: "The Youth League and all youth striving toward communism should study communism," not just studying from books, but also acting according to the true requirements of communism. Lenin also clearly pointed out, "Schools should become tools of proletarian dictatorship." Thus, Lenin's education of youth has class content and serves proletarian dictatorship. However, the Soviet revisionist traitors quoted only the first half of Lenin's sentence, taking it out of context, and completely trampled on Leninism. The methods of these traitors are truly despicable and shameless to the extreme.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." If the youth of the Soviet Union do not accept proletarian culture and ideology, they will accept bourgeois culture and ideology. The two are mutually exclusive. Learning has class content. So-called classless "learning" does not exist.

The struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat on the educational front is essentially a struggle to win over the youth. The Soviet revisionist leadership wants to cultivate Soviet youth into successors of the bourgeoisie to maintain their bourgeois dictatorship. Under the pretext of "the task of youth is to study," the Soviet educational departments have pushed out bourgeois zombies like "sociology" to students, fiercely attacking Stalin, and shamelessly praising the Soviet Communist Party platform and peddling "the party of the whole people" and "the state of the whole people." They also use the decadent culture of Western imperialism, especially the American way of life, to attack the youth of the Soviet Union. They use every means to lure youth onto the white specialist road of bourgeois individualism, cultivating them into intellectuals of the new bourgeoisie. This is the true content of the revisionist slogan "do not ask about politics, only ask about study."

The proletariat, to cultivate its own successors, has put forward revolutionary demands to the youth. Mao Zedong Thought is to have youth throw themselves into the fiery class struggle to learn and temper themselves, to learn swimming by swimming. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Recently, Chairman Mao also taught us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Chinese revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are following Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, taking up pens as spears, thoroughly smashing bourgeois ideology, and establishing proletarian ideology. Millions of Red Guards in China, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, have risen up to expose China's Khrushchev and a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, fighting to consolidate and strengthen China's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system. The youth of China, under the nurturing of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, in the great storms of class struggle, are tempering themselves into reliable successors of the proletariat.

We believe that the revolutionary youth of the Soviet Union will surely awaken, take the revolutionary road, the road of Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist clique, and reestablish proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union.

    腐蚀苏联青年一代的麻醉剂
    上海华东师大　红小兵
    苏修《共青团真理报》曾经刊载过一篇题为《不要用共产主义妄自尊大》的奇文，向苏联青年散布荒唐透顶的谬论，说什么青年的“任务就是学习。……至于是资产阶级的或无产阶级的文化——这暂时不关重要。”拆穿了，它就是要青年闭门读书，不要关心国家大事和世界大事，所谓“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”。他们是要消磨苏联青年革命意志，诱骗青年只搞业务，不问政治，脱离现实的阶级斗争。他们不要无产阶级专政，只要资产阶级专政。
    伟大的列宁曾经说过青年的任务“就是要学习”这句话。但是，列宁的原意明显地被苏修这伙叛徒们歪曲和阉割了。列宁在《青年团的任务》中还明确地指出：“青年团和所有想走向共产主义的一般青年都应该学习共产主义”，不仅是书本的学习，而且应该是按共产主义的真正要求去行动。列宁还明确指出，“学校应当成为无产阶级专政的工具”。可见，列宁所说的教育青年的任务是有阶级内容的，是为无产阶级专政服务的。可是苏修叛徒们引了列宁的上半句话，断章取义，把列宁主义完全糟踏了。这伙叛徒的手法真是卑鄙无耻到了极点。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”苏联的青年一代不接受无产阶级的文化和意识形态，就要接受资产阶级的文化和意识形态。二者必居其一。学习，是有阶级内容的。所谓超阶级的“学习”是没有的。
    资产阶级和无产阶级在教育阵地上的斗争，实质上就是争夺青年一代的斗争。苏修领导集团就是要把苏联青年培养成资产阶级的接班人，以维护其资产阶级专政。苏修的教育部门在“青年的任务就是学习”这一幌子下，向学生搬出了诸如“社会学”之类的资产阶级僵尸，大反斯大林，大肆吹捧苏共纲领和贩卖“全民党”“全民国家”。他们还用腐朽透顶的西方帝国主义的“文化”，特别是美国生活方式，来向苏联青年一代进攻。他们千方百计地诱惑青年走上资产阶级个人主义的白专道路，把他们培养成为新兴资产阶级的知识分子。这就是所谓“不问政治，只问学习”的这句修正主义格言的真实内容。
    无产阶级为了培养自己的接班人，向青年一代提出了革命的要求。毛泽东思想，就是要青年投身到火热的阶级斗争中去学习，去锻炼，在游泳中学会游泳。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”。最近毛主席又教导我们，要斗私，批修。用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国革命青年，正是遵循了毛主席的光辉教导，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中拿起笔作刀枪，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想。中国千百万红卫兵革命小将，同广大的工农兵群众一起，奋起千钧棒，揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为巩固和加强我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度而斗争。中国的青年一代，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，正在锻炼成为无产阶级的可靠的接班人。
    我们相信，苏联的革命青年们，一定会觉醒起来，走革命的道路，走列宁主义和毛泽东思想的道路，起来造苏修集团的反，在苏联重新建立起无产阶级专政。
