Mount Fuji is roaring, and a wave of anti-American struggle is sweeping across the Japanese archipelago.

On October 8th, thousands of brave Japanese youth, in opposition to the visit of the pro-American, traitorous Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku to the puppet regime in South Vietnam, engaged in a fierce battle with fully armed Japanese reactionary military police at Tokyo's airport. This demon Sato had not even left the country when he was struck with a blow to the head, forcing him to sneak away on a plane under police protection. This struggle by Japanese youth has boosted the morale of the Japanese people and once again dealt a powerful blow to the American and Japanese reactionaries.

The Sato government, facing unarmed patriotic youth, treated them as a major threat, deploying hundreds of armored and police vehicles, thousands of armed police and plainclothes agents to carry out savage suppression. The Japanese reactionary military police injured over two hundred students and beat one student to death with batons. This atrocity once again exposed the true nature of the "democratic politics" boasted by the likes of Sato, which is nothing more than a trick to deceive the people. The Sato government's brutal suppression of the people is a complete implementation of fascist military rule.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long said: "The Japanese people are a great people. They will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over them for long." "The Japanese people have hope."

In this wave of anti-American patriotic struggle that erupted in Tokyo, Japanese youth have shown a heroic spirit of defiance. They are not afraid of armored vehicles, not afraid of batons and bullets, not afraid of fascist wolves, and bravely stand at the forefront of the anti-American struggle. Those revolutionary youth who charge into the front lines of the anti-American patriotic struggle are the pride of the Japanese people and the hope of the Japanese nation.

Since the Sato government came to power, it has actively served American imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia. In recent times, it has been particularly eager to help American and Soviet revisionists forge an anti-China encirclement in Asia, running around frantically. After his conspiratorial activities in South Korea and Taiwan, Sato is now heading to Indonesia, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, and South Vietnam. Japanese militarism, under the patronage of American imperialism, has already risen from the ashes and is being used by American imperialism as the number one henchman for aggression in Asia. Sato's visit to Saigon is clearly aimed at further involving Japan in the American war in Vietnam. This is contrary to the interests of the Japanese people and is something that the Japanese people absolutely cannot tolerate.

Japanese youth's angry protest against Sato's activities in Saigon reflects the strong sentiment of the Japanese people against the American and Japanese reactionaries. Before this, on October 1st, revolutionary masses in Yamaguchi and Fukuoka counties held a massive anti-American demonstration at a U.S. military base. After the outbreak of the anti-American struggle by Tokyo youth, various progressive organizations and patriotic figures in Tokyo warmly supported the revolutionary actions of the youth. These facts fully demonstrate that a new wave of anti-American struggle will inevitably rise on the Japanese archipelago.

The American and Japanese reactionaries and their lackeys and running dogs hate and fear the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people to the core. They are desperately trying to slander and defame the just struggle of Tokyo's patriotic youth. The Miyamoto revisionist group has also jumped out eagerly, maliciously slandering the brave struggle of Japanese youth, shamelessly referring to the conflict between armed police and "counter-revolutionaries." One cannot help but ask, if Japanese youth's anti-American patriotic struggle is labeled as "counter-revolutionary," then according to your absurd logic, isn't the fascist violence of Sato's reactionary police actually a "revolutionary action"? This is a barefaced exposure of the treacherous, counter-revolutionary face of the Miyamoto revisionist group, which betrays the Japanese revolution and the world revolution.

Great Lenin once pointed out: "Not to believe in the masses, to be afraid of their initiative, to be afraid of their creative spirit, to tremble before their revolutionary will... this is the most serious crime of the leaders of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Mensheviks." He also said, "Whoever opposes the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses will become a traitor to the revolution and a betrayer of the revolution."

The common characteristic of all opportunists, all old and new revisionists, is that they fear the masses and fear the revolutionary actions of the masses. They will inevitably turn from fearing the masses and fearing the revolution to opposing the masses and betraying the revolution. The Miyamoto revisionist group has degenerated into such a traitor to the revolution, a shameful lackey of the American and Japanese reactionaries.

However, no matter how the American and Japanese reactionaries carry out fascist suppression, and no matter how the Soviet revisionist group and the Miyamoto revisionist group obstruct and sabotage, the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people will inevitably advance. The Japanese people harbor immense revolutionary power, just like the magma beneath Mount Fuji, which can erupt at any time. No counter-revolutionary forces can stop the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people. One day, the Japanese people will achieve complete liberation, and a completely independent, people's democratic new Japan will stand on the stormy Pacific!

　　日本列岛卷起了反美怒涛
　　本报评论员
    富士山在怒吼，日本列岛又卷起了反美斗争的怒涛。
    十月八日，数千名英勇的日本青年学生，为了反对日本亲美卖国首相佐藤荣作访问南越傀儡集团，在东京机场同全副武装的日本反动军警展开了一场激烈的搏斗。佐藤这个瘟神未出国门，就遭到迎头一棒，不得不在警察的保护下偷偷摸摸地钻进飞机溜走。日本青年的这次斗争，鼓舞了日本人民的斗志，又一次给了美日反动派有力地打击。
    佐藤政府面对手无寸铁的爱国青年学生，如临大敌，出动几百辆装甲车和警备车，上千名武装警察和便衣特务，进行野蛮的镇压。日本反动军警打伤学生二百余人，并用警棍把一名学生活活打死。这一暴行，又一次揭穿了佐藤之流所吹嘘的日本“民主政治”，不过是愚弄人民的把戏。佐藤政府残暴镇压人民，实行的完全是军国主义的法西斯统治。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就说过：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“日本人民是有希望的。”
    在这次东京爆发的反美爱国斗争中，日本青年表现了不畏强暴的英雄气概。他们不怕装甲车，不怕警棍枪弹，不怕法西斯豺狼，勇敢地站在反美斗争的最前线。那些在反美爱国斗争中冲锋陷阵的革命青年，是日本人民的骄傲，是日本民族的希望所在。
    佐藤政府上台以来，积极地为美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策和战争政策效劳。最近一个时期，它更是卖力地为美帝苏修在亚洲拼凑反华包围圈，东奔西跑。佐藤在南朝鲜、台湾进行阴谋活动之后，这次又要去印尼、新西兰、澳大利亚、菲律宾和南越活动。日本军国主义在美帝国主义的扶植下已经死灰复燃，并且正在被美帝国主义当作侵略亚洲的头号打手。佐藤到西贡去，显然要使日本进一步卷入美国的侵越战争。这是同日本民族的利益背道而驰的，是日本人民所绝对不能容许的。
    日本青年愤怒抗议佐藤去西贡活动，反映了日本人民反对美日反动派的强烈情绪。在这之前，十月一日，山口、福冈等县的革命群众，在美军基地举行了声势浩大的反美示威游行。在东京青年学生反美斗争爆发以后，东京各进步团体和各界爱国人士热烈地声援青年学生的革命行动。这些事实充分表明，新的反美斗争的大风暴迟早会在日本列岛上兴起。
    美日反动派及其奴仆和走狗，对日本人民的反美斗争恨之入骨，怕得要命。它们正在竭力诽谤和诬蔑东京爱国青年的正义斗争。宫本修正主义集团也迫不及待地跳了出来，大肆诬蔑日本青年的英勇斗争，居然卑鄙无耻地称之为武装警察同“反革命分子”之间的“冲突”。人们不禁要问，日本青年进行反美爱国斗争，竟然成了“反革命分子”，那末，按照你们的这种荒谬逻辑，佐藤政府反动警察的法西斯暴行，岂不是反倒成了“革命的行动”吗？这正是赤裸裸地暴露了宫本修正主义集团背叛日本革命和世界革命的丑恶的反革命嘴脸。
    伟大的列宁曾经指出：“不相信群众，怕他们发挥创造性，怕他们发挥主动性，在他们的革命毅力面前发抖……这就是社会革命党人和孟什维克的领袖们最严重的罪过”。又说，谁如果反对群众的革命热情，谁“就会成为背叛革命和出卖革命的人”。
    一切机会主义者、一切新老修正主义者的共同特点，就是害怕群众，害怕群众的革命行动。他们从害怕群众、害怕革命必然要走向敌视群众、反对革命的背叛道路。宫本修正主义集团正是这样堕落成为革命的叛徒、美日反动派的可耻奴仆。
    但是，不论美日反动派如何进行法西斯镇压，也不论苏修集团和宫本修正主义集团如何阻挡和破坏，日本人民的革命事业，总是要向前发展的。日本人民中间蕴藏着巨大的革命力量，正象富士山下凝聚着的岩浆一样，随时都会迸发出来。任何反革命势力也阻挡不了日本人民反美斗争的洪流。终有一天，日本人民要获得彻底的解放，一个完全独立的、人民民主的新日本，必将出现在波涛汹涌的太平洋上！
