Let's Hold Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes Nationwide

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao instructed: We must fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, taking 'fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism' as our guideline, to strengthen ideological education for military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. We must hold various study classes, with the center holding them, localities holding them, and all revolutionary mass organizations also able to hold them, turning the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought."

The revolutionary masses of Shanghai have, in order to strengthen the ideological construction of the revolutionary ranks, universally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, gaining many good experiences. We hope that all localities across the country will, like Shanghai, fully mobilize the masses to create more good experiences and methods for holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our task is to lead a great nation of tens of millions of people in an unprecedented, great struggle. Therefore, the task of universally and deeply studying Marxism-Leninism theory is, for us, an urgent problem that must be solved and to which we must devote serious efforts."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally, is a great revolution to transform people's worldviews. In this great revolution, the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview are engaged in fierce struggles and conflicts within the depths of every person's soul. Various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, in accordance with the laws of class struggle, tenaciously manifest themselves. To overcome bourgeois ideology, to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the path of proletarian revolution, to enable us to achieve the greatest fighting strength in the struggle against revisionism and to prevent revisionism, we must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" in our minds.

Through more than a year of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every proletarian revolutionary, every revolutionary cadre, and every Red Guard has undergone severe tests and gained many positive and negative experiences. This has created the most favorable conditions for us to study extensively, summarize extensively, and raise our standards extensively.

Taking "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, to universally hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, is a good form and method to help old cadres, new cadres, and Red Guards to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to overcome various non-proletarian ideologies, and to raise their ideological and political standards. This is our Party's glorious tradition of educating the masses and cadres, and a major strategic measure to promote the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our old cadres, the vast majority of whom are good. They are loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, having done much work for the Party and the people, and having made great contributions. However, some of them, in a peaceful environment, have relaxed their own study and self-transformation, becoming, to varying degrees, detached from the masses and from reality. At the same time, they lack experience and understanding of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, committing various errors in the movement. Holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is to start from education, to expand the scope of cadre education, to give them time and opportunities to seriously summarize experiences, learn lessons, carry forward achievements, correct shortcomings and errors, and better understand and grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; to encourage them to put down their burdens and stride forward with the proletarian revolutionary ranks.

Holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is also to continuously infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the new cadres who have emerged, to help them learn and inherit our Party's fine traditions, to make them have democratic style, have the spirit of self-criticism, closely connect with the masses, closely connect with reality, and politically mature faster.

For the Red Guard ranks that have grown up in more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there is also the task of transforming their worldviews. If Mao Zedong Thought is not used to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, and if the fight against the "self" in one's mind is relaxed, these revolutionary new soldiers and young fighters may also make mistakes. Holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is to strengthen the education of the Red Guards. Revolutionary cadres should use their personal experiences to educate and guide them. Political and ideological work for them mainly involves reasoning with them.

To hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, we must closely combine them with the actual practice of more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively. We must combine study with application, to learn and apply simultaneously, and to focus on the "application." Through study, we must promote the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units, further developing and consolidating the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

To hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, relying on the masses to educate themselves and each other. Using the rectification method, we must carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially conducting serious self-criticism, to thoroughly fight against the "self" in our minds, to thoroughly fight against selfishness, pragmatism, sectarianism, factionalism, and anarchism.

To hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, we must carry forward the three-eight work style of the People's Liberation Army, not only to be serious and tense, but also to be united and lively. We must have a democratic atmosphere, allowing different opinions to be debated and contested. We must combine the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, making our ranks into a revolutionary army that is united in step and full of vigor.

Let's hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes nationwide, turning all factories, rural areas, institutions, schools, and troops into red Mao Zedong Thought schools. In this way, the movement of the seven hundred million people studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively will surely advance to a new and higher level.

### 全国都来办毛泽东思想学习班

　　全国都来办毛泽东思想学习班
    最近，我们的伟大领袖毛主席指示：要斗私，批修。林彪同志说：“我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，用‘斗私，批修’这四个字为纲，加强对军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。”
    上海无产阶级革命派，为了加强革命队伍的思想建设，普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，取得了许多好经验。我们希望全国各地，都象上海那样，充分发动群众，创造出办好毛泽东思想学习班更多的好经验、好办法。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的任务，是领导一个几万万人口的大民族，进行空前的伟大的斗争。所以，普遍地深入地研究马克思列宁主义的理论的任务，对于我们，是一个亟待解决并须着重地致力才能解决的大问题。”
    无产阶级文化大革命，归根到底，是改造人们世界观的大革命。在这场大革命中，无产阶级的世界观和资产阶级的世界观，在每个人的灵魂深处一直进行着激烈的冲突和斗争。形形色色的资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想，都在按照阶级斗争的规律，顽强地表现出来。要战胜资产阶级思想，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来，要使我们在防修、反修的斗争中获得最大的战斗力，就必须用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争。
    经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，每一个无产阶级革命派，每一个革命干部，每一个红卫兵都受到了严峻的考验，取得了许多正面和反面的经验。这就为我们大学习、大总结、大提高创造了最有利的条件。
    以“斗私，批修”为纲，普遍地举办毛泽东思想学习班，这是帮助老干部、新干部和红卫兵活学活用毛主席著作，克服各种非无产阶级思想，提高思想政治水平的好形式、好方法。这是我们党教育群众、教育干部的光荣传统，是推动无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的重大战略措施。
    我们的老干部，绝大多数都是好的。他们忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想，为党、为人民做了许多工作，立下了功劳。但是，他们中有的人，在和平环境中，放松了自己的学习和改造，不同程度地脱离群众，脱离实际。同时，他们对于这场无产阶级文化大革命，又缺乏经验，很不理解，在运动中犯了这样那样的错误。举办毛泽东思想学习班，就是要从教育着手，扩大对干部的教育面，给他们以时间和机会，认真地总结经验，吸取教训，发扬成绩，改正缺点和错误，更好地理解、掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；鼓励他们放下身上的包袱，大踏步地跟上无产阶级的革命队伍。
    举办毛泽东思想学习班，同时就是要不断地向新涌现的干部灌输毛泽东思想，帮助他们学习和继承我们党的优良传统，使他们具有民主作风，具有自我批评精神，密切联系群众，密切联系实际，在政治上更快地成熟起来。
    对于在一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中成长起来的红卫兵队伍来说，也有一个改造世界观的任务。如果不用毛泽东思想去克服资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，放松了对自己头脑中
  “私”字的斗争，这些革命新兵，这些革命小将，也就有可能犯错误。举办毛泽东思想学习班，就是要加强对红卫兵的教育。革命干部要用自己的切身体会，去教育和引导他们。对他们作政治思想工作，主要是同他们讲道理。
    办好毛泽东思想学习班，要很好地结合一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的实际，活学活用毛泽东思想。要学用结合，边学边用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。通过学习，推动革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    办好毛泽东思想学习班，要遵照毛主席的教导，依靠群众自己教育自己，群众互教互学。用整风的方法，开展批评与自我批评，特别是多做认真的自我批评，把自己头脑中的“私”字狠狠斗掉，把利己主义、实用主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、无政府主义狠狠斗掉。
    办好毛泽东思想学习班，要发扬人民解放军的三八作风，不但要做到严肃、紧张，而且要做到团结、活泼。要有民主空气，允许不同意见的争论和交锋。要把无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性结合起来，使我们的队伍成为一支步伐整齐、生气勃勃的革命大军。
    全国都来办毛泽东思想学习班，把全国的工厂、农村、机关、学校、部队都办成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。这样，七亿人民活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，必将推进到一个新的更高的水平。
