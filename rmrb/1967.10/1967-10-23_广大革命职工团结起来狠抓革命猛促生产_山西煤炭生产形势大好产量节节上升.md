Revolutionary workers across Shanxi province have united to seize the revolution and promote production, responding to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." While deepening the revolutionary criticism and consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance, they have rolled up their sleeves and promoted production. The province's coal output has been steadily rising, powerfully supporting socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to statistics from relevant departments, the province's average daily coal output in mid-September increased by 41% compared to early September. By late September, it had increased by another 24%, and in early October, it increased by another 12%. Coal quality has significantly improved, and the consumption rate of pit props has been continuously reduced.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally issued the letter "To the Workers on the Coal Industry Front," which greatly inspired the coal workers of Shanxi province. Many workers excitedly said, "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee sending us a letter is the greatest trust, the greatest care, the greatest inspiration, and the greatest support for us." The entire coal system in the province organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which went deep into the mining teams, groups, and workers' dormitories to widely propagate the letter from the Party Central Committee. Above and below ground, everywhere was filled with enthusiasm. The revolutionary rebels of the Red Third Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau initiated a high-yield day competition on September 10, exceeding the plan by 64%. This achievement inspired the coal workers across the province. The revolutionary rebels of the Jin Dongnan Baotou Coal Mine, which has exceeded the production plan every month this year, insisted on doing a good job of revolution above ground and production below ground, making revolution on the spot, and saving revolution. On September 15, they completed the year's coal production plan 107 days ahead of schedule.

"Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's latest directive spread, and the coal workers across the province were overjoyed. The wind of revolutionary great alliance quickly swept across the entire coal front of the province. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, many revolutionary mass organizations achieved revolutionary great alliance, forming a mighty revolutionary army to seize the revolution and promote production. The production enthusiasm surged higher and higher. After achieving revolutionary great alliance, the revolutionary rebels of the Xi Shan Mining Bureau saw their daily output from September 23 to 30 increase by 53% compared to before the alliance. The revolutionary rebels of the Shiqiaojie Coal Mine united as one, maintained the revolutionary order of the proletariat, protected state property, and saw high-yield days emerge continuously.

Revolutionary workers across the coal front of the province actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, and launch a great exposure and criticism of the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, headed by Chinese Khrushchev. The deeper the revolutionary criticism goes, the greater and deeper the hatred of the broad masses of workers towards Chinese Khrushchev becomes, and the higher their enthusiasm and energy for revolutionary mining and socialist labor become. The revolutionary workers of the Datong Coal Mine used large meetings, small meetings, pre-shift meetings, post-shift meetings, cartoons, street performances, and big-character posters to expose and criticize Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary workers of the Yongdingzhuang Mine said, "What 'material incentives,' 'profit-oriented'? Let Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist goods go to hell. We revolutionary workers have only one mind: to mine for the revolution." Despite facing considerable difficulties, the revolutionary workers of this mine ensured a rapid increase in coal output, creating a record of daily output increasing by 80%.

    广大革命职工团结起来狠抓革命猛促生产
    山西煤炭生产形势大好产量节节上升
    新华社太原二十二日电　山西省煤炭工业战线广大革命职工，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在深入开展革命大批判和巩固发展革命大联合的同时，鼓足干劲，猛促生产，全省煤炭产量节节上升，有力地支援了社会主义建设，支援了无产阶级文化大革命。
    据有关部门统计，全省平均煤炭日产量，九月中旬比九月上旬增长了百分之四十一，九月下旬又比九月中旬增长了百分之二十四，十月上旬又比九月下旬增长了百分之十二。煤炭质量显著提高，坑木消耗率不断下降。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自签发的《给煤炭工业战线职工的信》，给山西省广大煤炭职工以极大的鼓舞。许多工人激动地说，毛主席、党中央给我们来信，是对我们的最大信任，最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大支持。全省煤炭系统组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，深入采煤队、组、职工宿舍广泛宣传党中央的来信，井上井下，到处热气腾腾。大同矿务局红三矿的无产阶级革命派，九月十日首先发起高产日竞赛，超额百分之六十四完成计划。这一成就鼓舞了全省煤炭战线职工。今年以来月月超额完成生产计划的晋东南包头煤矿的无产阶级革命派，坚持上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，就地闹革命，节约闹革命，在九月十五日提前一百零七天超额完成了全年的煤炭生产计划。
    “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的这一最新指示传来，全省煤矿职工一片欢腾。革命大联合的东风迅速吹遍全省煤炭战线。许多革命群众组织在毛主席最新指示的指引下实现了革命大联合，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，抓革命，促生产，生产热潮一浪更比一浪高。西山矿务局的无产阶级革命派实现了革命的大联合后，九月二十三日至三十日的日产量比革命大联合前猛增百分之五十三。石圪节煤矿的无产阶级革命派团结一致，维护无产阶级的革命秩序，保护国家财产，高产日不断出现。
    全省煤炭战线广大革命职工，活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，集中火力，集中目标，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大揭露，大批判。革命大批判搞得越深入，广大职工对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨就越大越深，为革命采煤、为社会主义劳动的热情就越高，干劲就越大。大同煤矿革命职工用大会、小会、班前会、班后会，漫画、活报剧、大字报专栏等各种形式，人人动手，个个动口，对中国赫鲁晓夫口诛笔伐。永定庄矿的革命职工说，什么“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”，让中国赫鲁晓夫这套修正主义黑货见鬼去吧。我们革命工人只有一个心眼：为革命采煤。这个矿的革命职工在相当困难的情况下，保证了煤炭产量迅速上升，创造了日产量猛增百分之八十的纪录。
