President Moktar Ould Daddah of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, along with the delegation he led, concluded their visit to our country. Carrying with them the friendship of the Chinese people towards the people of Mauritania, they left Beijing today to visit Korea.

Premier Zhou Enlai went to the airport to see them off. When leaving, President Daddah requested Premier Zhou Enlai to convey his warm and friendly greetings to Chairman Mao.

Also present at the airport to see them off were Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, Zhou Jianren, Vice Minister of Defense Si Yu, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in the capital, heads of various government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, as well as Chinese Ambassador to Mauritania Lü Zhixian.

Today, the capital airport was adorned with red flags. Thousands of revolutionary masses from the capital gathered at the airport, holding high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and large banners reading "Firmly support the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial struggle of the Mauritanian people," and other slogans. They enthusiastically cheered for the Mauritanian friends.

A grand farewell ceremony was held at the airport. The military band played the national anthems of Mauritania and China. President Daddah, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, inspected the honor guards of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, as well as the militia and Red Guard honor guards, and circled the field to bid farewell to the revolutionary masses. At this time, the people waved the national flags of the two countries and continuously shouted, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Before boarding the plane, a squad of Red Guards loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the reactionaries look fierce, but they are all paper tigers. In essence, they are reactionaries, and they are bound to perish. The people of the whole world should unite and defeat the imperialist and all reactionaries!"

Diplomats from the Mauritanian Embassy in China and various countries' embassies in China also went to the airport to see them off.

Premier Zhou Enlai received a letter from President Moktar Ould Daddah of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania today as he left Beijing. President Daddah expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for the warm reception given to the delegation and himself during their state visit to China. The full text of the letter of thanks is as follows:

To Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China:

As I leave Beijing, I once again express my sincere thanks to the Chinese people, the Chinese Party, and the Chinese government for the particularly warm welcome and fraternal hospitality extended to the delegation and me during our state visit to your beautiful country. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by your wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, aims to restore the dignity of the brave Chinese people, purify their revolutionary virtues, and enable the Chinese people to better contribute to the struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and underdevelopment. I am truly benefited by this visit at a time when this great revolution is achieving brilliant victories. This fills me with genuine joy. Finally, I firmly believe that the friendly, united, and cooperative relations between China and Mauritania, based on the common ideals of peace, justice, friendship, and mutual understanding, as well as between the peoples of all countries in the world, will continue to develop and strengthen. This is beneficial to both China and Mauritania. Please once again convey my greetings to Chairman Mao Zedong, wishing him good health and longevity.

Yours sincerely,
Moktar Ould Daddah
