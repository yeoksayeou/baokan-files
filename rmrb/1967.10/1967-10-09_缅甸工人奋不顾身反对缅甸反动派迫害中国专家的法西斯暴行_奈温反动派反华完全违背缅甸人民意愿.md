	Burma's workers fearlessly oppose the fascist atrocities of the Burmese reactionary forces against Chinese experts. The Ne Win reactionary clique's anti-China stance completely goes against the will of the Burmese people.

	Rangoon, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) — According to the economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma, hundreds of Chinese experts working in Burma have established deep friendships with Burmese workers. When the Ne Win reactionary government whipped up an anti-China and anti-Chinese frenzy, many Burmese workers fearlessly stood side by side with the Chinese experts to oppose the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government.

	Since June this year, the Ne Win reactionary government has been madly carrying out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, intensifying restrictions and persecution against Chinese experts. On one hand, it organized mobs to viciously slander Chinese experts during anti-China activities; on the other hand, under the pretext of "protection," it dispatched large numbers of military police to surround the residences of Chinese experts, intensified the activities of plainclothes agents, and brutally restricted the freedom of movement of the experts, turning their residences into concentration camps. The reactionary military police of Ne Win also committed gross personal assaults on the experts, arbitrarily barged into their offices, and even threatened them with gun barrels. A Burmese official in charge of a certain construction site even publicly threatened, "We cannot guarantee the safety of Chinese experts." Under such circumstances, all Chinese experts unanimously stopped work to express their strongest protest against the Ne Win reactionary government.

	Workers on various construction sites were indignant at the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government and expressed their support for the just action of Chinese experts stopping work to protest. They denounced and condemned the heinous crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government. They told the Chinese experts, "The Ne Win reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese stance completely goes against the will of the Burmese people." "We have learned the truth about Ne Win's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities from the Beijing Radio. We completely support and endorse the broadcasts of the Beijing Radio." The Ne Win reactionary government repeatedly attempted to instigate Burmese workers on construction sites to stage anti-China demonstrations and "demonstrate" against Chinese experts, but each time they were firmly rejected by the Burmese workers, foiling their plots.

	Due to the Ne Win reactionary government's organization of mobs to commit atrocities everywhere, Burmese workers were very concerned about the safety of Chinese experts. Many workers expressed to the experts that they would use their own lives to protect the experts' safety. They said, "Whoever dares to touch a single Chinese expert, we will fight to the death."

	Despite the strict blockade of Chinese experts' residences by Burmese military police, Burmese workers braved the dangers of being expelled and arrested, overcoming numerous difficulties to find various opportunities to meet with the experts. On the fifth day of the Chinese expert team's stop-work protest, more than 20 Burmese workers on a certain construction site braved the dangers to negotiate with the Burmese authorities, demanding the lifting of restrictions on the freedom of movement of Chinese experts. Some workers, despite repeated threats from military police and agents, insisted on visiting Chinese experts. They said, "Even if we go to jail, we are not afraid." Some workers often lingered around the experts' residences, and as soon as they saw the experts, they would rush over, asking about everything, showing great concern. Not long ago, an expert team from a certain place was transferred from the construction site to Rangoon. Burmese workers used every means to break through the military police blockade to see off the Chinese experts and brought them precious gifts. They hugged the experts tightly, reluctant to part, with tears in their eyes. Some workers who could not come themselves sent their children to bid farewell to the experts or wrote letters to express their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their sincere gratitude to the Chinese experts.

	The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is extremely deep, and it is something that no one can destroy. The Ne Win reactionary government's mad anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, using every means to try to destroy this friendship, will only make the broad masses of the Burmese people more clearly recognize the ugly face of this fascist military government. The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma will certainly develop and strengthen in the struggle against the common enemy.

    缅甸工人奋不顾身反对缅甸反动派迫害中国专家的法西斯暴行
    奈温反动派反华完全违背缅甸人民意愿
    新华社六日讯　仰光消息：根据中缅两国经济技术合作协定在缅甸工作的数百名中国专家，同缅甸工人建立了深厚的友谊，在奈温反动政府掀起反华排华的妖风恶浪的时候，许多缅甸工人奋不顾身，同中国专家站在一起，反对奈温反动政府的法西斯暴行。
    奈温反动政府今年六月疯狂进行反华排华以来，就加紧对中国专家的限制和迫害。它一方面组织暴徒在反华活动中恶毒污蔑中国专家；同时以“保护”为名，派大批军警包围中国专家住地，加紧便衣特务活动，野蛮限制中国专家的行动自由，把专家住地变成了集中营。奈温的反动军警还对专家进行粗暴的人身侵犯，擅自闯入专家的办公室，甚至用枪口对着中国专家进行威胁。某工地缅方负责人竟公开威胁说：“不能保证中国专家安全。”在这种情况下，全体中国专家一致停工，对奈温反动政府表示最强烈的抗议。
    各工地的缅甸工人对奈温反动政府的这种法西斯暴行义愤填膺，纷纷表示支持中国专家停工抗议的正义行动，并控诉、声讨奈温反动政府的滔天罪行。他们对中国专家说：“奈温反动政府反华排华是完全违背缅甸人民的意愿的。”“我们从北京电台知道奈温反华排华的真相，我们完全支持和拥护北京电台的广播。”奈温反动政府多次企图策动工地上的缅甸工人搞反华游行，向中国专家“示威”，但每次都遭到缅甸工人的坚决拒绝，使其阴谋不能得逞。
    由于奈温反动政府组织暴徒到处行凶，缅甸工人非常担心中国专家的安全。许多工人向专家表示，他们要用自己的生命来保卫专家的安全。他们说：“谁要动一动中国专家，我们就同他拚。”
    尽管缅甸军警严密封锁中国专家住地，缅甸工人仍冒着被开除和被逮捕的危险，冲破重重困难，寻找各种机会与专家见面。在中国专家组停工抗议的第五天，某工地二十多个缅甸工人不顾危险向缅甸当局提出交涉，要求取消对中国专家行动自由的限制。有些工人不顾军警特务一再威胁，坚持要探望中国专家。他们说：“就是坐牢也不怕。”有些工人经常在专家住地四周徘徊，一见到专家，就一拥而上，问长问短，甚为关怀。不久前，某地专家组从工地转移到仰光，缅甸工人想方设法突破军警的封锁来为中国专家送行，并带来他们珍贵的礼物。他们把专家紧紧抱住，依依不舍，热泪盈眶。有的工人自己不能来，就派他们的小孩来向专家告别，或写信表达他们对毛主席的无限热爱和对中国专家的真诚感谢。
    中缅两国人民有着极其深厚的友谊，这是任何人也破坏不了的。奈温反动政府疯狂反华排华，千方百计企图破坏这种友谊，其结果只能使广大缅甸人民更加清楚地认识到这个法西斯军人政府的狰狞嘴脸。中缅两国人民的友谊必将在反对共同敌人的斗争中日益发展和巩固。
