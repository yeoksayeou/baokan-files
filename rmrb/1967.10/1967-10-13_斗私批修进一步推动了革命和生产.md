	Struggle Against Self and Criticize Revisionism Further Promotes Revolution and Production

	In many factories in Wuhan, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have used Mao Zedong Thought to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, quickly achieving revolutionary unity. Revolutionary criticism is thriving, and production tasks are being overfulfilled.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 12 — Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan's industrial sector are "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism." Many factories have achieved revolutionary unity, further promoting revolution and production.

	Factories such as Wuhan Machine Tool Factory, Wuhan Enamelware Factory, Wuhan Radio Components Factory, Hankou Power Plant, Wuhan Third Textile Mill, Central South Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory have all recently achieved revolutionary unity. Some factories, like Wuhan Chemical Factory, originally had very united revolutionary mass organizations, and now they are even more united. The current situation in Wuhan's factories, where revolutionary unity is emerging, is excellent! This is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's latest instructions speak the hearts of the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses. They say: We will listen to and act on every word and sentence of Chairman Mao. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses take the initiative to act from below and upwards, achieving revolutionary unity by workshop, section, and throughout the entire factory. When some leaders within their own revolutionary mass organizations are still causing factionalism and vying for positions, the broad revolutionary masses automatically unite and use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to prompt their leaders to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, abandon their factions, discard the "I," and quickly achieve revolutionary unity. In Hankou Power Plant, there were two revolutionary mass organizations that, due to factionalism, even refused to sit together for major criticism sessions. In mid-September, they were still engaged in "internal warfare." When discussing revolutionary unity, they argued endlessly over the number of representatives. At this time, the rank-and-file members stood up to fiercely attack the "selfishness" of their leaders, prompting these leaders to make more self-criticisms, eliminate factions, and unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forming a unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire factory.

	Comrade Lin Biao says: "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." In the process of achieving revolutionary unity, the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, that is, the struggle between "public" and "private," runs through the revolutionary mass organizations. On this issue, these factories that have already achieved revolutionary unity have profound experiences. Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, when considering revolutionary unity, always think about how their organizations rebelled early, have more members, and made greater contributions. They worry that achieving revolutionary unity will eliminate their organization's banner and disperse their ranks, and they cannot accept it; some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations always calculate how many people from their organization can enter the leadership after achieving revolutionary unity, and they argue endlessly over these matters, even staying up all night in meetings without resolution. Later, everyone brought their problems, studied and applied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant works "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" to examine their own thoughts, discovering that the root cause of these problems is the "selfishness" in their minds. If left unchecked, it could be exploited by bad elements, leading to "internal warfare," causing pain to friends and joy to enemies. They say, what "my banner" and "your banner," only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought can we achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and only by strictly following Chairman Mao's instructions can we ensure the continuous victory of the revolution in our unit. Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations have come to realize that "selfishness" is the great enemy in the mind during revolutionary unity, and only by using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize "selfishness" and firmly establish "public-mindedness" can we ensure the achievement and consolidation of revolutionary unity.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." Comrades from various revolutionary mass organizations deeply feel that we unite for the revolution, and unite to better carry out the revolution. They express their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the grand direction of the revolutionary struggle, further improve revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation in their units, improve revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and further implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Now, in factories that have achieved revolutionary unity, the situation of revolution and production is very good. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries have set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere in the factories, established special columns for criticism, and verbally and in writing condemn the capitalist-roaders in power within the party, headed by China's Khrushchev. Revolutionary criticism promotes the development of production, and many factories report good production news. Factories such as Wuhan Machine Tool Factory, Central South Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Wuhan Enamelware Factory, and Wuhan Chemical Factory all overfulfilled their production tasks in September.

### 斗私批修进一步推动了革命和生产

　　斗私批修进一步推动了革命和生产
    武汉许多工厂的无产阶级革命派，用毛泽东思想破私立公，迅速实现革命大联合。革命大批判热火朝天，生产任务超额完成
    据新华社武汉十二日电　武汉地区工业战线的无产阶级革命派在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的教导下，“斗私，批修”，许多工厂实现了革命的大联合，进一步推动了革命和生产。
    武汉机床厂、武汉搪瓷厂、武汉市无线电元件厂、汉口发电厂、武汉第三棉纺织厂、中南汽车制造厂、武汉柴油机厂等单位的革命群众组织，都在最近实现了革命大联合。还有一些工厂如武汉化工厂等，原来厂内各革命群众组织就很团结，现在更加团结了。武汉工厂企业当前出现的这种革命大联合的形势好得很！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的最新指示说出了广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的心里话。他们说：毛主席的话，我们字字句句都要听，字字句句都要照办。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众自觉地行动起来，以下促上，自下而上地按班组、车间直至全厂实现革命大联合。当自己的革命群众组织里某些负责人还在闹派性、争席位的时候，广大革命群众就自动地联合起来，并且用毛主席的最新指示去促进他们的负责人破私立公，丢掉山头，抛掉“我”字，尽快地实现革命大联合。汉口发电厂有两个革命群众组织，前一阵因为闹山头，连搞大批判也不愿坐在一起，九月中旬还在打“内战”。讨论大联合问题时，又为名额争论不休。这时，下面的队员就起来猛攻他们负责人的“私”字，促使这些负责人多作自我批评，铲除山头，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下联合起来，成立了全厂统一的革命群众组织。
    林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”在实现革命大联合的过程中，革命群众组织内部贯穿着无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争，即“公”与“私”的斗争。在这个问题上，这些已经实现革命大联合的工厂中的革命群众组织都有深刻体会。有些革命群众组织的负责人在酝酿革命大联合时，心里老惦记着，我的组织造反早，我的组织人数多，我的组织贡献大，实现革命大联合把我的组织旗号搞掉了，队伍拉散了，心里想不通；也有个别革命群众组织的负责人，老是计较实现革命大联合后，我的组织里能有几个人进入领导班子等等，为这些事，有时争论不休，通宵开会也得不到解决。后来大家带着问题，活学活用毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，对照自己的思想进行了检查，发现产生这些问题的原因，是由于自己头脑里“私”字作怪，如果任其发展下去，可能被坏人利用，引起“内战”，使亲者痛仇者快。他们说，什么“打我的旗号”“打你的旗号”，只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，只有不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示办事，才能保证本单位的革命永远胜利前进。许多革命群众组织的负责人都认识到，“私”字是革命大联合中思想上的大敌，必须以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批“私”字，大立“公”字，才能保证实现和巩固革命的大联合。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”各革命群众组织的同志在革命大联合的过程中，深深体会到，我们是为革命而联合，联合起来要更好地干革命。他们表示，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，进一步搞好革命大批判和本单位斗批改，搞好革命大联合和革命“三结合”，进一步贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针。现在，在已经实现了革命大联合的工厂里，革命和生产的形势都很好。广大无产阶级革命派在厂里到处摆开了革命大批判战场，办了大批判专栏，口诛笔伐以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。革命的大批判推动了生产的发展，许多工厂生产喜讯频传。武汉机床厂、中南汽车制造厂、武汉搪瓷厂、武汉化工厂等工厂，九月都提前超额完成了生产任务。
