"Overcome selfishness and criticize revisionism" summarizes the main tasks and fundamental purposes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only by seriously and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions can we thoroughly smash the old ideas of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and establish Mao Zedong Thought, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Criticizing revisionism is the main task of the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrating the spearhead of the struggle on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow them politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

Only by using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons can we severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist ideological system of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This will enable the broad revolutionary masses to direct their greatest hatred towards the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, unite as one, and jointly fight the enemy, further developing and consolidating the great alliance of revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Our ultimate goal is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's souls, thoroughly smash the bourgeois worldview, and establish the proletarian worldview, completely uproot the source of revisionism, and ensure that Mao Zedong Thought occupies all positions, guaranteeing that our country will forever follow the Marxist-Leninist path from socialism to communism.

Currently, Chairman Mao's latest battle cry is guiding us forward like a beacon, and like a strong east wind, it inspires and encourages the fighting spirit of the broad revolutionary masses. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, under Chairman Mao's guidance of "overcome selfishness and criticize revisionism," achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    斗私批修  乘胜前进
    “斗私，批修”，概括了无产阶级文化大革命的主要任务和根本目的。只有认真地、坚决地贯彻毛主席这一最新指示，才能大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想，大立毛泽东思想，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    批修，是文化大革命的主要任务。无产阶级革命派必须坚定不移地掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头集中指向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透批倒批臭。
    只有用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，狠批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义思想体系，才能使广大革命群众，把最大的仇恨集中到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上，团结一致，共同对敌，使革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”进一步得到发展和巩固。
    我们的终极目的是，用毛泽东思想改造人的灵魂，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，彻底挖掉修正主义根子，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，保证我们国家永远沿着马克思列宁主义的道路由社会主义过渡到共产主义。
    当前，毛主席的最新战斗号令正象指路明灯般地指引着我们乘胜前进，象一股强劲的东风，鼓舞和激励着广大无产阶级革命派的战斗豪情。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在毛主席的“斗私，批修”方针指引下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。（《大众日报》十月四日社论）
