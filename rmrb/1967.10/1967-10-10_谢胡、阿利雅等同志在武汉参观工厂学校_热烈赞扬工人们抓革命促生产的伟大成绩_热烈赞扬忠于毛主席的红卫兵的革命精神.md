When Comrade Xie Hu and others arrived at the Wuhan Boiler Factory, both sides of the main road, windows of high-rise buildings, and cranes were filled with welcoming crowds. Revolutionary masses beat drums and gongs, waving the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Hoxha!" Wherever Comrade Xie Hu and others went, there was a scene of great joy. Countless enthusiastic hands reached out to shake hands warmly with Comrade Xie Hu and Comrade Zhou Enlai. Comrade Xie Hu and others continuously waved to the people and had cordial conversations with the workers, enthusiastically praising the workers' great achievements in seizing the revolution and promoting production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, at the Wuhan Steel Plant, the scene was bustling with people everywhere. Many workers who had just finished their night shifts did not rest but stayed to warmly welcome the Albanian comrades.

When Comrade Xie Hu and Comrade Aliya and others visited the Wuhan Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Huazhong Institute of Technology, Wuhan Institute of Water Transport Engineering, and Hubei University, tens of thousands of Red Guards rushed to the streets outside the school gates, performing the Yangge dance and beating drums, enthusiastically welcoming the Albanian guests.

During his visit to the Wuhan Institute of Water Transport Engineering, Comrade Aliya enthusiastically praised the Chinese Red Guards as being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, possessing a high level of revolutionary spirit. He hoped that the Chinese Red Guards would always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Wuhan Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Huazhong Institute of Technology, and Hubei University also held mass rallies of over ten thousand people each to welcome the Albanian guests from the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. The Albanian comrades delivered passionate speeches at the rallies, expressing their most resolute support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, praising the great victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and unanimously pointing out: the victory of this great revolution is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also a victory for the Albanian people and revolutionary people all over the world.

During their visits to these four schools, Comrade Xie Hu and others presented red banners inscribed with "Long live the eternal friendship between Albania and China!" to the glorious Chinese Red Guards. The Chinese Red Guards presented "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Mao badges, and Red Guard armbands to the Albanian comrades.

Tonight, Wuhan revolutionary cultural workers held an art evening for the Albanian guests, performing wonderful art programs.
