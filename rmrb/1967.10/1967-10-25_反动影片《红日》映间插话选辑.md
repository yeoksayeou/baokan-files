	Our army is retreating, and the soldiers look listless, appearing completely disorganized.
	Interjection: The People's Liberation Army of China is a people's army created and led by Chairman Mao, an invincible force. The filmmakers, standing on the reactionary position of the Kuomintang, distort historical facts and maliciously defame our army, portraying this invincible force as a defeated army. Their goal is to undermine the pillar of proletarian dictatorship and prepare public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev to seize power within the party.

	At the foot of Lian Water Tower, Zhang Lingfu and a group of reactionary officers pose for a photo.
	Interjection: Look, this counter-revolutionary executioner Zhang Lingfu, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people, is portrayed here as a "great hero." The filmmakers go to great lengths to erect a "monument to his merits" and take "victory photos" for him. Through this, they summon the spirits of the Kuomintang bandits hiding in Taiwan, cheer for the Kuomintang reactionaries' crazy calls to "retake the mainland," and boost the morale of the ghosts and monsters attacking the party. How evil their intentions are!

	At the military headquarters, General Shen and Political Commissar Ding are talking.
	Interjection: At the critical moment of the decisive battle, the general and political commissar look dejected, thinking about requesting punishment. The filmmakers completely distort the facts, confusing right and wrong, portraying our army from top to bottom as filled with a sense of failure, while the enemy's 74th Division is "well-disciplined" and "fighting spirit is high." This fully exposes the reactionary face of the filmmakers who love the enemy and hate our army.

	Our company commander Shi Donggen is drunk and riding a horse wildly.
	Interjection: Look, in the filmmakers' portrayal, our company commander is depicted as what kind of person? Is this just a defamation of one of our company commanders? No, this is a malicious slander and attack on the People's Liberation Army created and led by Chairman Mao. The filmmakers impose all the ugly appearances of the Kuomintang reactionary army on our army, attempting to defame the great wall of the People's Liberation Army of China. This is the "innovative monologue" of the counter-revolutionaries like Qu Baiyin.

	Zhang Xiaofu attempts to persuade Zhang Lingfu to surrender and is shot dead by Zhang Lingfu.
	Interjection: The film, through the capture, release, persuasion, and killing of Zhang Xiaofu, maliciously distorts and attacks our army's policy on prisoners of war, exaggerating Zhang Lingfu's "unwillingness to surrender" and "unyielding heroism." The filmmakers defame our army and glorify the enemy army, attempting to meet the counter-revolutionary political needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, to politically disintegrate the People's Liberation Army of China, and to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship in our country. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, will not agree to this in a thousand ways, in ten thousand ways! We must criticize and denounce the makers of the reactionary film "Red Sun" and their backers, the Chinese Khrushchev, and turn them into a pile of filth unworthy of humanity.

    反动影片《红日》映间插话选辑
    画面：我军在撤退中，战士们无精打彩，显出一副溃不成军的样子。
    插话：中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和统帅的战无不胜的人民军队。影片编导者站在国民党的反动立场上，篡改历史事实，恶毒丑化我军，把这支常胜之军写成了失败之师，其目的就是要动摇无产阶级专政的柱石，为中国的赫鲁晓夫篡党篡政作舆论准备。
    画面：涟水塔下，张灵甫等一伙反动军官拍照留影。
    插话：请看，这个双手沾满人民鲜血的反革命刽子手张灵甫，在这里却成了神气活现的“盖世英雄”。影片编导者费尽心机地为张灵甫立“纪功碑”，拍“胜利照”，借此给龟缩台湾的蒋匪帮招魂，为国民党反动派疯狂叫嚣“反攻大陆”摇旗呐喊，为牛鬼蛇神向党进攻打气助威，用心何其恶毒也！
    画面：军部，沈军长、丁政委谈话。
    插话：在决战关头，军长、政委却垂头丧气，他们想到的是请求处分。编导者完全颠倒事实，混淆黑白，把我军上上下下描绘得充满了失败情绪，而敌七十四师却是“军容整齐”、“斗志昂扬”，这就完全暴露了影片编导者爱敌军、恨我军的反动嘴脸。
    画面：我军连长石东根醉酒纵马。
    插话：看，在影片编导者的笔下，我军连长竟成了一个什么样的人物？难道这仅仅是对我军一个连长的丑化吗？不，这是对毛主席亲手缔造和统帅的人民解放军的恶毒污蔑和攻击。影片编导者把国民党反动军队的一切丑态都强加在我军头上，妄图诋毁中国人民解放军这座伟大的长城，这就是瞿白音之流反革命的“创新独白”。
    画面：张小甫劝降，被张灵甫一枪打死。
    插话：影片通过对张小甫的一俘、一放、一劝、一毙，恶毒地歪曲和攻击我军俘虏政策，渲染了张灵甫“宁死不降”、“坚贞不屈”的“英雄气节”。编导者丑化我军，美化敌军，妄图配合国内外阶级敌人的反革命政治需要，从政治上瓦解我中国人民解放军，来推翻我国的无产阶级专政，我们无产阶级革命派一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们一定要把反动影片《红日》的炮制者和他们的后台中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒，批臭！把他们批成不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
