	Beijing Military Region convenes a meeting of support personnel from the coal industry in North China to exchange experiences
	Using Mao Zedong Thought to support production is the fundamental guarantee for victory in both revolution and production
	Support personnel are full of fighting spirit and confidence, determined to follow Chairman Mao's great policy of "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" to help revolutionary workers accelerate the increase in coal production and quality, and strive to achieve even greater victories in the fourth quarter

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region recently held a meeting to exchange experiences on supporting and promoting production among support personnel working on the coal industry frontline in North China. At the meeting, the support personnel seriously studied Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China, and summarized the experiences of supporting and helping the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to promote revolution and production. The meeting believed that the revolutionary and production situation in the coal industry in North China is getting better and better, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers is getting stronger and stronger, and the experiences of promoting revolution and production are getting richer and richer. The attendees are determined to, in this favorable situation, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and create new merits for the people in the process of vigorously promoting revolution and vigorously promoting production.

	North China is one of the important coal production regions in our country. After Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left and support industry, the Beijing Military Region responded immediately and dispatched a large number of support personnel to enter the coal mines. The officers and soldiers, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in various mining areas, vigorously promoted revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving remarkable results. The Jingxing Coal Mine has exceeded the state plan every month. From January to September this year, the original coal production of this mine exceeded the state plan by 7.3%. The Jingxi, Datong, Kailuan, and Fengfeng coal mines, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," have also seen a new situation in both revolution and production.

	The support personnel from the coal industry frontline emphasized in their exchange of experiences that the People's Liberation Army must resolutely support the left and actively help the broad revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly handle the relationship between revolution and production, and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, with revolution leading production. This is the fundamental guarantee for running a socialist enterprise well and achieving victory in both revolution and production.

	The Jingxi Changgouya Coal Mine once experienced a decline in production, with some advocating to first boost production and then carry out revolutionary criticism. At this time, the officers and soldiers of the PLA, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions in the mine, reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," making everyone realize that in dealing with production issues, one must first focus on politics. We are engaged in socialist production, and if we deviate from the socialist direction, no matter how many meters of tunneling or tons of coal mining we achieve, it will only lead the industrial and mining enterprises onto the capitalist road. Then, the officers and soldiers helped the proletarian revolutionary factions analyze the reasons for the decline in production, which were precisely the result of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party inciting some deceived masses to go out for linkages and instigate armed struggles. The sharp class struggle educated the broad revolutionary masses, and thus all the revolutionary workers in the mine immediately mobilized to fiercely expose and criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. In this way, not only did production once again show a thriving upward trend, exceeding the state plan, but the revolutionary criticism also deepened.

	At the experience exchange meeting, the support personnel mentioned that helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to achieve revolutionary great unity by system, establishing a new revolutionary order, and insisting on local revolution, part-time revolution, and economical revolution is an important guarantee for grasping revolution and promoting production. After achieving revolutionary great unity by system, the Jingxi Mining Bureau Mucity Coal Mine combined revolutionary criticism with the three-in-one combination of its unit, making the revolution more solid and production continuously rising. After the third section of the backfill achieved revolutionary great unity by system, production became even more united, and the daily output of raw coal increased by more than 50% compared to before.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." The support personnel attending the meeting also introduced their experiences of helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to boldly liberate cadres and fully utilize revolutionary cadres. They deeply felt that whether or not to fully utilize revolutionary cadres is the touchstone for whether Mao Zedong's cadre policy is implemented and whether cadres are truly trusted and relied upon. Through the help of the support personnel and the proletarian revolutionary factions to the cadres, as well as the cadres' own practice of the two-line struggle and active study of Chairman Mao's works, now many cadres in many coal mines have stood out, participated in the temporary power organs of the three-in-one combination, and worked with the workers to solve key production problems, playing their due roles in promoting revolution and production.

	Through this meeting, the personnel executing support tasks on the coal industry frontline are even more full of fighting spirit and confidence, firmly expressing their determination to, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism," help the proletarian revolutionary factions to accelerate the increase in coal production and quality with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and strive to achieve even greater victories in the fourth quarter.

    北京部队召集华北地区煤炭工业战线支工人员交流经验
    用毛泽东思想支工是革命生产双胜利的根本保证
    支工人员斗志昂扬，信心百倍，决心在毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大方针指引下，帮助革命职工加速提高煤炭生产的产量和质量，争取第四季度打个更大的漂亮仗
    据新华社讯　中国人民解放军北京部队最近召开了战斗在华北地区煤炭工业战线上的支工人员抓革命促生产经验交流会。会上，支工人员认真学习了毛主席在视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的极为重要的指示，总结了支持和帮助无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众抓革命促生产的经验。会议认为，华北地区煤炭工业战线的革命和生产形势越来越好，广大职工的革命干劲越来越大，抓革命促生产的经验越来越丰富。到会人员决心在大好形势下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在狠抓革命，猛促生产中，为人民建树新的功勋。
    华北地区是我国煤炭生产的重要地区之一。毛主席发出人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众和支援工业的伟大号召后，北京部队闻风而动，派出大批支工人员进入煤矿。指战员们同各矿区的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一起狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了显著成绩。井陉煤矿月月超额完成国家计划。今年一至九月份这个煤矿原煤产量超额百分之七点三完成了国家计划。京西、大同、开滦、峰峰等煤矿在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的鼓舞下，革命和生产也出现一派新气象。
    来自煤炭工业第一线的支工负责人在交流经验时，以自己的切身体会强调指出：人民解放军必须坚决支持左派，积极帮助广大革命群众按照毛主席的教导，正确处理革命和生产的关系，用毛泽东思想挂帅，以革命统帅生产，这是办好社会主义企业，夺取革命、生产双胜利的根本保证。
    京西长沟峪煤矿一度出现了生产下降的趋势，有人主张先把生产突上去，回头再搞革命的大批判。这时，解放军指战员们和矿里无产阶级革命派一起重温了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，使大家认识到在处理生产问题时，必须首先着眼于政治。我们搞的是社会主义生产，如果离开了社会主义方向，再多的掘进米数和采煤吨数也只能把工矿企业引到资本主义道路上去。接着，指战员又帮助无产阶级革命派分析了生产下降的原因，正是不甘心失败的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派唆使一些受蒙蔽的群众外出串连、挑动武斗所造成的。尖锐的阶级斗争教育了广大革命群众，于是全矿革命职工立即动员起来，狠揭狠批党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。这样，不但使生产又出现了蓬勃上升的大好形势，超额完成了国家计划，而且使革命大批判更加深入了一步。
    在经验交流会上，支工人员谈到，帮助无产阶级革命派实现按系统的革命大联合，建立起革命的新秩序，坚持就地闹革命、业余闹革命、节约闹革命，是抓好革命，促好生产的重要保证。京西矿务局木城涧煤矿在实现按系统的革命大联合以后，把革命大批判和本单位斗批改结合起来，使革命搞得更加扎实，生产不断上升。回采三段按系统实现了革命大联合以后，生产上更加同心协力，原煤日产量比以前提高了百分之五十以上。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”到会的支工人员还介绍了他们帮助无产阶级革命派大胆解放干部，放手使用革命干部的经验。他们深有体会地说，能不能放手使用革命干部是衡量是否贯彻毛主席的干部政策，是否真正相信和依靠干部大多数的试金石。经过支工人员和无产阶级革命派对干部的帮助，以及干部本身通过两条路线斗争，活学活用毛主席著作，现在许多煤矿大批干部站了出来，参加了三结合的临时权力机构，和工人一起顶班劳动，一起解决生产中的关键问题，在抓革命促生产中发挥了应有的作用。
    通过这次会议，在煤炭工业战线上执行支工任务的人员更加斗志昂扬，信心百倍，坚决表示一定要在毛主席“斗私，批修”伟大方针的指引下，帮助无产阶级革命派以“只争朝夕”的革命精神加速提高煤炭生产的产量和质量，争取在第四季度打个更大的漂亮仗。
