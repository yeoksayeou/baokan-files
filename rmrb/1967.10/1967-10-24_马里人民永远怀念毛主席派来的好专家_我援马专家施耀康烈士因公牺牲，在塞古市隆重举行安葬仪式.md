The funeral ceremony for Chinese expert and Chinese Communist Party member, martyr Shi Yaokang, who recently passed away in Mali, was solemnly held in the second largest city of Mali, Segou, on the 19th.

Comrade Shi Yaokang arrived in Mali in February this year and worked at the Segou Textile Mill, which is being built with Chinese aid. On October 11th, the Niger River experienced a historically rare flood, seriously threatening the city of Segou. Chinese experts working at the Segou Textile Mill actively participated in the flood prevention efforts. Comrade Shi Yaokang, who was ill at the time, also rushed to the front lines of the flood prevention efforts and participated in the work despite his illness. Due to overwork, his condition worsened, and despite the efforts of Malian medical personnel and Vietnamese doctors working in Mali to save him, he passed away on October 17th.

Mali held a grand funeral and memorial service for Comrade Shi Yaokang. Attendees included a delegation from the Malian National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution and the Malian government, led by Sedou Badian Kouyate and Dollo Somine, the Minister of Health and Social Affairs, as well as representatives from the Segou government, mass organizations, and over 3,000 workers and residents from the textile mill. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mali, Liu Helin, and Chinese experts working at the textile mill also participated in the funeral and memorial service.

Alioune Sissoko, the deputy speaker of the Malian National Assembly, presided over the memorial service. The administrative head of the Segou region, Abdoulaye Diko, expressed condolences and sympathy to the Chinese government and people, as well as to the family of Comrade Shi Yaokang. Diko said, "Shi Yaokang is truly a student of Chairman Mao. He actively applies the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, takes Norman Bethune as his example, and regards the revolutionary cause of the Malian people as his own."

Diko quoted Chairman Mao's evaluation of Norman Bethune's internationalist spirit: "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication to the cause is reflected in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every communist should learn from him." He said, "We have seen with our own eyes that the great friendly country of China has sent experts to help us, especially the late Chinese expert Shi Yaokang, who has always shown this noble spirit." He also quoted Chairman Mao's words: "People are bound to die, but death has different meanings. An ancient Chinese writer named Sima Qian said: 'A man's death is as certain as the setting of the sun, but the significance of his death can be as heavy as Mount Tai or as light as a feather.' To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather." He concluded, "The Chinese government and the family of Shi Yaokang agreed to let him rest on the soil of Mali as a symbol of the friendship and unity between our two peoples. This particularly moves us. The Malian people will take the remembrance of the Chinese expert Shi Yaokang and the learning of his shining example as their duty."

The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mali, Liu Helin, and the representative of the Chinese experts, Lu Shiren, also spoke at the memorial service.

The Malian government representative said, "We will bury Comrade Shi Yaokang near this factory, so that our future generations can remember him, because he gave his life for the friendship between China and Mali."

During the burial, about 3,000 residents of Segou gathered around the gravesite, bidding a sorrowful farewell to the remains of Comrade Shi Yaokang.

Members of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, including the first deputy speaker of the National Assembly, Yakuba Megu, the Minister of Justice and Labor, Madera Keita, and the chairman of the Economic and Financial Commission of the Sudanese Union Party, Sedou Badian Kouyate, represented the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, President Modibo Keita, the Malian people, and the Malian government in paying their respects at the Chinese Embassy.

    马里人民永远怀念毛主席派来的好专家
    我援马专家施耀康烈士因公牺牲，在塞古市隆重举行安葬仪式
    据新华社巴马科二十三日电　最近在马里逝世的中国专家、中国共产党党员施耀康烈士的安葬仪式，十九日在马里第二大城市塞古市隆重举行。
    施耀康同志今年二月到达马里，在中国援助兴建的塞古纺织联合厂工作。十月十一日尼日尔河出现历史上罕见的洪水，严重威胁着塞古市区。在塞古纺织联合厂工作的中国专家们，积极参加了防洪斗争。正在病中的施耀康同志也赶到防洪前线，带病参加防洪。他因为劳累过度，病势加重，经过马里医务工作人员和在马里工作的越南医生们全力抢救无效，终于在十月十七日逝世。
    马里各界为施耀康烈士举行了隆重的送葬和追悼会。参加追悼会的有以马里保卫革命全国委员会成员塞杜·巴迪昂·库亚特和卫生和社会事务部长多洛·索米内等人组成的马里保卫革命全国委员会和马里政府代表团、塞古机关、群众组织代表及联合纺织厂工人和居民三千多人。中国驻马里大使馆临时代办刘和林和在联合纺织厂工作的中国专家也参加了送葬和追悼会。
    马里国民议会副议长阿利翁·西索科主持了追悼会。塞古地区行政长官阿卜杜拉耶·迪科在追悼会上向中国政府和人民以及施耀康同志的家属表示哀悼和慰问。迪科说：施耀康不愧为毛主席的学生，他活学活用伟大的毛泽东思想，以白求恩为榜样，以马里人民的革命事业作为自己的事业。
    迪科说，毛主席在评价白求恩的国际主义精神时说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”我们亲眼看到，伟大的友邦中国派来援助我们的中国专家，特别是与世长辞的中国专家施耀康，始终表现出这种高贵的精神。他还引用毛主席的话说：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”他最后说：中国政府、施耀康的家属同意让施耀康在马里的国土上安息，作为我们两国人民之间的友谊和团结的象征。这一点特别使我们感动。马里人民将把怀念中国专家施耀康和学习他的光辉榜样，作为自己应尽的职责。
    中国驻马里大使馆临时代办刘和林和中国专家代表陆士荣也在追悼会上讲了话。
    马里政府代表说，我们要把施耀康烈士葬在这个工厂的附近，“是为了使我们的后代怀念他，因为他为马中友谊献出了生命。”
    安葬时，约有三千塞古居民聚集在墓地周围，怀着深切的悲痛心情，向施耀康烈士遗体告别。
    保卫革命全国委员会成员、国民议会第一副议长亚库巴·梅加，保卫革命全国委员会成员、司法部长兼劳工部长马戴拉·凯塔，保卫革命全国委员会成员、苏丹联盟党经济和财政委员会主席塞杜·巴迪昂·库亚特，代表保卫革命全国委员会、莫迪博·凯塔总统、马里人民和马里政府前往中国大使馆吊唁。
