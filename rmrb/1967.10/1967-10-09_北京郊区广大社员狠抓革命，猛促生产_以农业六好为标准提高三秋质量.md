Broad masses of commune members in the suburbs of Beijing are vigorously promoting revolution and production, striving to achieve the "six excellences" in agriculture to improve the quality of the autumn harvest.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Beijing are implementing Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are actively engaged in the autumn harvest production, determined to achieve the "six excellences" in agriculture and secure a bumper harvest this year.

After the publication of the editorial "Achieving the Six Excellences in Agriculture During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" in the *People's Daily* on September 24, the frontline command departments for revolution and production in various counties and districts in the suburbs of Beijing immediately sprang into action. They organized commune members and cadres to further study Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production," "we must grasp grain, we must grasp cotton, we must grasp cloth," "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," and the editorial in the *People's Daily*. Using the "six excellences" in agriculture as a standard, they reviewed the autumn harvest work, accelerated the progress of the autumn harvest, and improved its quality. The frontline command department for revolution and production in Beijing organized five working groups to go to the counties with the largest autumn sowing areas in the suburbs, such as Fangshan, Shunyi, Tongxian, Daxing, and Pinggu. They worked together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to discuss and solve new problems that arose during the autumn harvest. Many county and district offices, after achieving revolutionary unity, dispatched a batch of personnel to the countryside to strengthen leadership. Shunyi County alone sent more than 300 cadres from the departments of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and agricultural machinery to the countryside. According to the requirements of the "six excellences" in agriculture, they strengthened the leadership of the autumn harvest work.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres fighting on the frontline of the autumn harvest are striving to achieve the "six excellences" in agriculture. They are working to harvest quickly, plow in time, sow and plant wheat thoroughly, select good seeds, and complete the procurement tasks excellently. The Kaoying Brigade of Caizhu Commune in Daxing County united the revolutionary masses of the entire village, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres to criticize the revisionist poison spread by the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, which promoted material incentives. They emphasized Mao Zedong Thought, highlighted proletarian politics, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. After the publication of the editorial in the *People's Daily*, the revolutionary masses of this brigade immediately organized all commune members to study it. Everyone unanimously decided to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call to action by vigorously promoting revolution and production. Now, this brigade has completed its grain procurement tasks and can significantly advance the completion of the autumn harvest and sowing tasks. The fifth team of Gaobeidian Commune in Chaoyang District has a large population but few people, and the autumn sowing tasks are heavy. Originally, it was planned to reduce the wheat sowing area. After studying the editorial in the *People's Daily*, the cadres and commune members criticized the thoughts of fearing hard work and fatigue, rearranged the production, and expanded the wheat field area. The party branch secretary and the 63-year-old chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association fought day and night with the commune members, rolling in mud, making the progress of the autumn harvest and sowing much faster than last year.

At the meeting on grain procurement in the suburbs of Beijing held on September 26, revolutionary cadres from relevant departments at the municipal and county levels, based on Chairman Mao's instruction of "considering the interests of the state, collective, and individuals," studied the relevant policies for achieving the "six excellences" in agriculture. They made specific arrangements for this year's grain procurement and autumn distribution work, determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, give full play to the roles of various departments, support the countryside, and achieve new successes in the "six excellences" in agriculture.

    北京郊区广大社员狠抓革命，猛促生产
    以农业六好为标准提高三秋质量
    据新华社八日讯　北京郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，积极投入三秋生产，决心做到农业六好、夺取今年农业全面丰收。
    九月二十四日《人民日报》社论《在无产阶级文化大革命中做到农业六好》发表以后，北京郊区各县区抓革命促生产第一线指挥部立即行动起来，组织社员、干部进一步学习了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”，“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”，“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导和《人民日报》社论，以农业六好为标准，检查三秋工作，加快三秋进度，提高三秋质量。北京市抓革命促生产第一线指挥部组织了五个工作小组，到郊区秋播面积最多的房山、顺义、通县、大兴、平谷等县，与贫下中农、革命干部共同商量解决三秋中出现的新问题。许多县区的机关在实现了革命大联合以后，都抽调了一批人到农村加强领导。顺义县仅农林、水利、农业机械三个局就有三百多名干部下乡，根据农业六好的要求，切实加强三秋工作的领导。
    战斗在三秋第一线的广大贫下中农、革命干部按照农业六好的要求，正努力做到收得快，耕得及时，种足种好小麦，选好种子，出色完成征购任务。大兴县采育公社韩营大队的无产阶级革命派团结全村贫下中农、革命干部，清算了旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团大搞物质刺激的修正主义的流毒，大立毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，农业生产获得了空前大丰收。《人民日报》社论发表后，这个大队的无产阶级革命派立即组织全体社员学习，大家一致决定以狠抓革命，猛促生产的实际行动来响应毛主席、党中央的战斗号召。现在，这个大队的粮食征购任务已全部完成，秋收秋种任务也可以大大提前完成。朝阳区高碑店公社高碑店五队，地多人少，秋播任务繁重，原计划要缩小种麦面积。在学习了《人民日报》社论后，干部、社员批判了怕忙、怕累的思想，重新安排了生产，扩大了麦田面积。党支部书记和六十三岁的贫协主任，日夜与社员战斗在一起，滚得满身泥巴，使秋收秋种进度比去年快很多。
    在九月二十六日召开的北京市郊区征购会议上，来自市县有关领导部门的革命干部，根据毛主席的“兼顾国家、集体、个人三方面的利益”的指示，研究了做到农业六好的有关各项政策，对今年粮食征购和秋收分配工作作了具体部署，决心更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发挥各部门的作用，支援农村，在做到农业六好中立新功。
