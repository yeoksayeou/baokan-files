Japanese revolutionary youth, standing on the front line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, are closely combining their study of Chairman Mao's work "The Direction of the Youth Movement" with actual struggle. They are deeply integrating with workers and peasants, following Chairman Mao's teachings to advance the just anti-American patriotic struggle.

This group of Japanese youth held their first study session on the 10th. The session began with a collective reading of the entire text of "The Direction of the Youth Movement." Participants, including students who fought against Japanese pro-American, sell-out Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's "visit" to South Vietnam at Haneda Airport and young people who supported the farmers of Sanrizuka in their struggle against the Japanese government's seizure of farmland to build an airport, shared their experiences of fighting against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and their insights on combining with workers and peasants. The meeting highly praised the spirit of fearlessness and daring to fight shown by Japanese patriotic youth in the struggle against Sato's "visit" to South Vietnam. They also expressed their condolences to Yamazaki Hiroaki, who was killed by Japanese armed police and died a glorious death.

One youth said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the exploiters and oppressors of the people and die for them is lighter than a feather." Yamazaki died a heroic death for the interests of the Japanese nation, and his death was a worthy one.

The youth attending the study session angrily denounced the slander and defamation by the Japanese Miyamoto revisionist group against this heroic action by Japanese patriotic students. They pointed out that this struggle dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and greatly inspired the Japanese people. The Miyamoto revisionist group cheered for the Japanese reactionaries' bloody suppression of students, thoroughly exposing their traitorous face.

Another youth pointed out: Whether in the 1960 struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" or in the recent struggle against Sato's "visit" to South Vietnam, Japanese youth have played a significant role, just as Chairman Mao said in "The Direction of the Youth Movement," youth are "an important army." Chairman Mao's great evaluation of the youth movement has greatly inspired Japanese youth fighting on the front line of the just anti-American patriotic struggle.

The youth participating in the study session focused on discussing Chairman Mao's thoughts on youth needing to combine with the masses of workers and peasants as pointed out in "The Direction of the Youth Movement." They deeply understood Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese intellectual youth and student youth must go to the workers and peasants. They must mobilize and organize the workers and peasants, who make up 90 percent of the Chinese population. Without this main force, relying solely on the army of intellectual youth and student youth, it is impossible to achieve victory against imperialism and feudalism." The youth at the meeting believed that the direction Chairman Mao pointed out for Chinese youth in the arduous years of the Chinese revolution is also the direction for today's Japanese youth and youth around the world. Only by combining with the masses of workers and peasants can youth fully play their role as a revolutionary "important army" and elevate the anti-American patriotic struggle of Japanese patriotic youth to a new stage.

Japanese youth who have been deeply involved in the agricultural support activities in the rural areas of Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka since May shared their initial experiences of following Chairman Mao's teachings to walk the path of combining with workers and peasants after opposing the Miyamoto revisionist group. They said: Chairman Mao pointed out: "How do we judge whether a youth is revolutionary or not? How do we distinguish him? There is only one criterion, that is, whether he is willing to and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants." They emphasized that Chairman Mao's truth about youth needing to combine with the masses of workers and peasants is being accepted by more and more Japanese revolutionary youth.

A youth who returned from Sanrizuka said: In the past, I also went to the countryside, but at that time, I acted like an intellectual, and the farmers didn't pay any attention to us. Now, because we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly learn from the farmers, insist on working, living, and fighting together with them, learn from them, reform ourselves, introduce the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to them, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, we quickly established class feelings with the farmers. Now, the farmers of Sanrizuka have regarded us as one of their ranks in the battle.

This youth exposed that the Japan Communist Party revisionist group has completely betrayed the working people. They do not support the farmers' struggle at all, and the farmers do not trust them. As Chairman Mao said: "...whether one is a fake Marxist or a true Marxist, it is completely clear by looking at his relationship with the broad masses of workers and peasants."

At the end of the study session, all the youth held up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud the great leader's teachings to the youth: "The world belongs to you, to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You are in the prime of your life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. We hope for you."

　　日本革命青年紧密结合实际斗争学习毛主席著作
　　遵照毛主席教导与工农结合推进反美爱国斗争
　　指出宫本集团为佐藤政府血腥镇压学生摇旗呐喊彻底暴露叛徒面目
    新华社东京十七日电  站在反帝、反修前线的一批日本革命青年，紧密结合实际斗争，学习毛主席著作《青年运动的方向》，正在深入工农，与工农群众相结合，推进反美爱国正义斗争。
    这批日本青年在十日举行了第一次学习会。学习会开始，他们集体朗读了《青年运动的方向》全文，然后由参加羽田机场反对日本亲美卖国首相佐藤荣作“访问”南越斗争的学生、支援三里塚农民反对日本政府强占农田修建机场斗争的青年等，介绍了与美日反动派斗争的情况以及与工农结合的体会。会上一致高度赞扬日本爱国青年在反对佐藤“访问”南越的斗争中所表现的不畏强暴、敢于斗争的精神，并且向被日本武装警察杀害而光荣牺牲的山崎博昭表示悼念。
    一位青年说：毛主席教导我们：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”山崎是为日本民族的利益而英勇牺牲的，他的死是死得其所。
    出席学习会的青年愤怒地谴责了日本宫本修正主义集团对这次日本爱国学生的英雄行动的诽谤和诬蔑，并且指出，这次斗争给美日反动派以沉重打击，给日本人民以巨大鼓舞。宫本修正主义集团为日本反动派血腥镇压学生而摇旗呐喊，彻底地暴露了它的叛徒面目。
    另一位青年指出：日本青年不论在一九六○年反对日美“安全条约”的运动中还是在最近反对佐藤“访问”南越的斗争中，都发挥了很大作用，正象毛主席在《青年运动的方向》文章中所说的那样，青年“是一个重要的方面军”。毛主席对青年运动的伟大评价，给战斗在反美爱国正义斗争最前线的日本青年以极大的鼓舞。
    参加学习的青年着重讨论了毛主席在《青年运动的方向》中指出的青年必须与工农群众结合的思想。他们深刻地体会了毛主席的教导：“中国的知识青年们和学生青年们，一定要到工农群众中去，把占全国人口百分之九十的工农大众，动员起来，组织起来。没有工农这个主力军，单靠知识青年和学生青年这支军队，要达到反帝反封建的胜利，是做不到的。”与会青年认为，毛主席在中国革命的艰苦年代，给中国青年指出的方向，也是给今天的日本青年和世界青年指出的方向。青年学生只有与工农群众结合，才能充分地发挥他们作为革命的“一个重要的方面军”的作用，才能把日本爱国青年学生的反美爱国正义斗争提高到一个新阶段。
    从今年五月开始深入千叶县农村三里塚进行“支农”活动的日本青年，介绍了他们在造了宫本修正主义集团的反之后，遵照毛主席的教导，决心走与工农结合的道路的初步体会。他们说：毛主席指出：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”他们强调说，毛主席的关于青年必须与工农群众结合的真理，正在被越来越多的日本革命青年所接受。
    一位从三里塚回来的青年说：过去我也去过农村，那时摆着知识分子的架子，农民根本不理我们。现在由于我们遵照毛主席的教导，甘当农民的小学生，坚持和农民共同劳动，共同生活，共同斗争，向农民学习，改造自己，向农民介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命，宣传毛泽东思想，很快地就同农民建立起阶级感情。现在，三里塚农民，已经把我们当成他们战斗行列中的一分子。
    这位青年揭露说，日共修正主义集团完全背叛了劳动人民。他们根本不支持农民的斗争，农民也根本不信任他们。正如毛主席所说：“……是一个假马克思主义者还是一个真马克思主义者，只要看他和广大的工农群众的关系如何，就完全清楚了。”
    学习会结束时，全体青年捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读伟大领袖对青年的教导：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”
