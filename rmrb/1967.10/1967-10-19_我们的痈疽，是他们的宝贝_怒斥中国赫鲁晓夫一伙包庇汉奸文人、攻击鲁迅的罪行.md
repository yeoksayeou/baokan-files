The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow any political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, in order to realize their evil plan of restoring capitalism, have carried out many conspiratorial activities. Over the past decade since the founding of the nation, they have used their minions to repeatedly attack Lu Xun on the cultural front, ruthlessly cut and mutilate his works, and maliciously distort the history of the struggle between the two lines on the literary and artistic front. However, for a notorious traitor like Zhou Zuoren, they have shown great solicitude, treating him as a "national treasure," shielding and utilizing him extensively, allowing him to spread poison on the cultural battlefield and harm the people. The contrast is stark and fully exposes their counter-revolutionary conspiracies.

In his brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Literature and art are for the imperialists, people like Zhou Zuoren and Zhang Ziping are like this, this is called traitorous literature and art." The Chinese Khrushchev and his minions, however, have tried every means to rehabilitate the traitor Zhou Zuoren. They have dressed up this broken-backed, mangy dog and let him re-emerge, continuing to harm the people's revolutionary cause. I remember that soon after liberation, they released Zhou Zuoren from the prison in Nanjing. The deputy director of the old Propaganda Department, Hu ××, was overjoyed and immediately instructed some of his trusted subordinates, in their capacity as officials of the state organ, to personally visit Zhou Zuoren at his residence in Badawan, boosting his status and creating public opinion. They also told the public security authorities: "Do not bother Zhou Zuoren anymore." In this way, this notorious traitor gained a legal status and completely escaped the supervision of the people and the dictatorship.

After successfully shielding Zhou Zuoren, they became even bolder and began to utilize him further. The deputy director of the old Propaganda Department, Hu ××, instructed his minions: "We can publish Zhou Zuoren's books," "His essays can also be collected into volumes in the future." They praised Zhou Zuoren as a "rare talent in China," saying that he could translate many foreign works and that his "language is fluent and simple, suitable for use as teaching materials for foreign literature." In fact, they needed to use feudal and capitalist works to poison the people, so they collected translations from as far back as ancient Greece to the Meiji Restoration in Japan. It is revealed that just one unit, the People's Literature Publishing House, published eleven books for this traitor, and there are six more that have been translated but not yet published. In this way, Hu ×× and the likes of Zhou Yang, on the one hand, used the blood and sweat of the working people and several ten thousand yuan of state property to support this imperialist running dog; on the other hand, they let this traitor use his filthy soul to poison our broad masses of people and young students.

What is even more intolerable is that the Chinese Khrushchev and his minions, for the sake of counter-revolution, have raised the red flag to oppose the red flag, brazenly attacking Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as being "outdated," advocating for a "non-class literature" in the future that "any class can accept," and using the traitor Zhou Zuoren to distort Lu Xun's revolutionary spirit under the guise of remembering Lu Xun. In 1956, on the twentieth anniversary of Lu Xun's death, due to the green light from the old Propaganda Department, Zhou Zuoren spread poison in many newspapers and publications. For example, in a small book published by the China Youth Publishing House titled "Helping Readers Understand and Learn from Lu Xun," Zhou Zuoren, following the instructions of the counter-revolutionary revisionists, used many vile tricks to deceive young people who did not know the truth and to numb the revolutionary will of the people. From this, we can see how evil their intentions are. It is well known that Lu Xun is an "unprecedented national hero," while Zhou Zuoren is a slave who, at the slightest sign of trouble, would hang the Rising Sun flag at his door and change "Zhou's residence" to "Yutai's residence." Because Lu Xun was unyielding and fought resolutely against the dark forces, he was first not tolerated by Zhou Zuoren and forced to move out of Badawan, and later was pursued by the imperialist running dogs of the Beiyang warlords, leading him to flee to Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, fighting in the gaps between the enemy, and finally settling in the south. However, in this book, Zhou Zuoren deliberately distorted history and, with ulterior motives, appended other people's articles to whitewash himself. The article says: "When my family and my uncle lived together in Beijing, I was very young, and by the time I grew up, my uncle had moved away, and then he lived in Shanghai..." Zhou Zuoren used this article to cover up the fact that Lu Xun was persecuted and instead exaggerated that "when we lived together, we were a happy and lively big family," trying to erase the class boundaries between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries and spreading the counter-revolutionary poison of "unity." In the conclusion of the article "Lu Xun and 'Dunsheng'," Zhou Zuoren shamelessly declared: "I hope that in the near future I can go to Shaoxing, not only to see the changes in my hometown after liberation but also to see the grandson of this 'Dunsheng'.... Because recalling past events, I might remember some forgotten things, which can be used as materials for my reminiscences, and this is not entirely a selfish wish." This passage is extremely malicious. It makes some young people with less experience think that Zhou Zuoren's long inability to return to his hometown was not due to his complete betrayal of the people, selling out his country, recognizing the enemy as his father, and serving the enemy without a face to return to Jiangdong; but rather due to being busy with official duties and working day and night. Zhou Zuoren here portrays himself as a revolutionary who only wants to retire and return home in his old age, as if he had not committed heinous crimes against the people, but had great merits, and as if he had not betrayed his country, but had deep feelings for it. It is truly shameless! A traitor, what qualifications does he have to defile the new literary world led by the Communist Party, and even dare to say that his production of poison is "not entirely a selfish wish"? This is truly outrageous!

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by the Chinese Khrushchev reached a frenzied level in their conspiracy to promote "all-people's literature" after the 20th Congress of the CPSU. I remember that in October 1956, during the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, they took the opportunity to make a big fuss about it. Before the meeting, Zhou Yang and his ilk, following the instructions of their master, drafted topics, assigned tasks, and studied "the formation of Lu Xun's worldview as a humanitarian and revolutionary democrat" and "the profundity of humanitarian thought in Lu Xun's works." During the meeting, they not only stuffed the presidium with remnants of the Qing dynasty, Kuomintang warlords, mentors of the 1930s, bourgeois politicians, traitors, spies, rightists, hooligans, counter-revolutionary revisionists, and a group of bourgeois reactionary "authorities" who had colluded with foreign countries, but also specially arranged for someone to accompany the great traitor Zhou Zuoren to attend the meeting. The important leader of the counter-revolutionary clique, Lu Dingyi, openly shouted on the stage: "We hope that all old and new writers and artists in the country, including those in Taiwan, will unite under the banner of patriotism." Look, what kind of country do they want to love? To let a great traitor come to "love the country," is this not a great mockery of them?

At that time, Zhou Zuoren had become their "treasure." In many articles, he appeared in the guise of an authority on Lu Xun. In one article, he even publicly said that the materials about Lu Xun, "what I know has become a rare book in the world, and I am sure it is worth recording," and with this, he blackmailed the masses, saying that the materials he held, "are like banknotes, spend one, and one less." A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, in order to let Zhou Zuoren spread poison freely, colluded with Zhou Zuoren, using each other. They also instructed newspapers and magazines to invite Zhou Zuoren to contribute, and for a time, Badawan was bustling with visitors, with contributors coming and going, and it was very lively. It seemed that the history of the Chinese cultural revolution was about to be muddled by them, and Lu Xun's fighting spirit was severely damaged. In 1959, out of indignation, I wrote a special chapter in my "Memoirs of Lu Xun" titled "So-Called Brothers," exposing the true facts and giving some young readers a historical outline. However, due to the shielding of Zhou Yang and his ilk, the great traitor Zhou Zuoren was not affected in the slightest.

Originally, under the instructions of the deputy director of the old Propaganda Department, Hu ××, the capitalist-roaders within the People's Literature Publishing House, under the pretext of advance manuscript fees, gave Zhou Zuoren a living allowance of 200 yuan per month. However, this traitor still thought it was too little, saying that he should be given 400 yuan per month. After hearing this, Zhou Yang immediately approved the full amount, treating him like a pig. During the three years of natural disasters, our broad revolutionary people and cadres overcame the difficulties brought by natural disasters and the Soviet revisionists, relying on their own efforts, working hard, and struggling. However, this great traitor Zhou Zuoren received special treatment. Some capitalist-roaders within the organs presented him with food and visited him to inquire about his "illness." Zhou Yang himself was also very concerned about him, loving and caring for him. When he went out, he specially handed over a stack of blank letterhead with his personal seal to Zhou Zuoren, letting him fill it out as he pleased, going wherever he wanted, letting him do as he pleased, and satisfying all his reactionary demands. Looking back, Zhou Yang and his ilk were so fond of Zhou Zuoren, while harboring so much hatred for Lu Xun, cutting and killing his works, adding annotations, spreading rumors, and attacking and striking him, determined to kill him. Is this coincidental?

Because he was shielded and supported by the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, this traitor Zhou Zuoren became very active whenever the class struggle at home and abroad intensified. It was like this after the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956, and it was also like this around 1962. During the period of temporary difficulties in our country, some counter-revolutionary revisionists released Zhou Zuoren again, colluding with all the ghosts and snakes to attack the Party. At that time, the traitor who was placed in power at the Lu Xun Museum spent 1,800 yuan to purchase Zhou Zuoren's reactionary diary as a "relic." Many newspapers and magazines also rushed to invite Zhou Zuoren to contribute, letting him issue calls to the domestic and foreign class enemies under the pseudonym "Zhong Mi." Moreover, Zhou Zuoren was not restricted in any way and could freely write for Hong Kong's reactionary newspapers. At that time, a shameless writer who kowtowed to the Kuomintang in Hong Kong brazenly attacked our revolutionary writers for using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to discuss Lu Xun's revolutionary experiences and fighting spirit, saying that on the mainland, "even Xu Guangping does not dare to tell the truth." He especially worked hard to praise Zhou Zuoren, saying that the missing parts in the Lu Xun materials had been filled by Zhou Zuoren's "Lu Xun's Ancestral Home" and "Characters in Lu Xun's Novels," and he "particularly hoped" that Zhou Zuoren would write another "Biography of Lu Xun." This group of ghosts and snakes, colluding internally and externally, attacking from both sides, created a chaotic situation, making people very indignant. They almost elevated this traitor to the heavens. I remember Lu Xun saying: After the revolution's victory, some former running dogs will hang out new signs to cover up the truth and deceive the world, "except to fight with them, there is no other way." To protect the revolutionary interests and expose the truth, in an article published on June 7, 1963, I once again exposed Zhou Zuoren's crimes during the enemy's puppet period, using the pretext of his mother's and others' difficult living conditions to instruct others to catalog and sell Lu Xun's books, attempting to eliminate Lu Xun's influence and suppress the people's revolutionary spirit. The day after the article was published, on June 8, 1963, this traitor angrily protested to the old "Beijing Evening News," saying that my exposure was "a baseless slander." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." We revolutionary people expose the crimes of traitors based on facts, and he calls it "baseless slander," then, the poisonous weeds he spreads in newspapers are not precisely the "fragrant flowers" of the counter-revolutionary revisionists? At that time, I did not fully understand why this scum of the nation and the country's vermin dared to be so arrogant? It was not until the Cultural Revolution began that I understood the reason. It turned out that he had a backer. It is revealed that Zhou Yang, the confidant of the Chinese Khrushchev, personally sealed: "Zhou Zuoren has never opposed communism." After hearing such flattering words about himself, Zhou Zuoren immediately wrote a letter to Zhou Yang expressing his gratitude, saying: "I am very grateful and comforted to hear this." With such a backer, how could he not be so bold and counterattack fiercely?

Lu Xun has been gone for thirty-one years. Although the class enemies have been continuously attacking him, his revolutionary spirit will forever inspire the people to fight bravely. In the last will he wrote before his death, Lu Xun warned us: "Those who harm others' teeth and eyes but oppose revenge and advocate tolerance, never associate with them." The Chinese Khrushchev, out of his counter-revolutionary needs, advocates "tolerance" and opposes revenge, opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and promotes class cooperation. As early as the debate over the two slogans in 1936, the Chinese Khrushchev stood on Zhou Yang's side, peddling this black commodity, saying that we should be "more daring, more open, completely open the door, discard all narrow-minded intolerance and arrogant rubbish, regardless of what party, what organization, what kind of person, you should all invite them in." He even openly shouted that we should not "fear losing leadership, fear being used by others, fear traitors coming to sabotage..." and so on. Thirty years have passed, but the minions of the Chinese Khrushchev have not forgotten their master's black instructions and are still more diligently practicing his political program, still "inviting" traitors to engage in sabotage activities for him and creating public opinion for their restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Distinguish between the reactionaries and the revolutionaries, expose the reactionaries' conspiracies and tricks, arouse the vigilance and attention of the revolutionaries, boost our morale, and demoralize the enemy, so as to isolate the reactionaries and defeat them or replace them." The cunning and viciousness of a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists lies in their confusion of class lines, distortion of history, reversal of enemies and friends, and mixing of black and white. The fact that the great traitor Zhou Zuoren was shielded and utilized by a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists after liberation has given us an extremely important lesson: to distinguish between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, "sweep away all harmful creatures," and enhance our revolutionary vigilance is of paramount importance. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like Emperor Xiang Yu." To ensure that our country will never change color and that our people will always be happy, we must respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

　　“我们的痈疽，是他们的宝贝”
　　——怒斥中国赫鲁晓夫一伙包庇汉奸文人、攻击鲁迅的罪行
　　许广平
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙为了实现他们复辟资本主义的罪恶计划，曾经进行了许多阴谋活动。建国十几年来，他们通过自己的爪牙，在文化战线上对鲁迅一再实行围攻，对鲁迅的作品残酷地实行砍削，对文艺战线上两条道路斗争的历史恶毒地进行篡改；而对一个不齿于人类的狗屎堆、臭名昭著的大汉奸周作人，他们却百般殷勤，视为“国宝”，加意包庇，放手利用，让他在文化阵地上大肆放毒，危害人民。两相对照，完全暴露了他们反革命阴谋的罪恶勾当。
    毛主席在他的天才著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，曾经明确地指出：“文艺是为帝国主义者的，周作人、张资平这批人就是这样，这叫做汉奸文艺。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙却想方设法为汉奸周作人翻案。他们把这一条断了脊梁骨的癞皮狗乔装打扮一番，让其重新出笼，继续危害人民革命事业。记得刚刚解放，他们就把周作人从南京监狱中保释出来，旧中宣部的常务副部长胡××如获至宝，立即指使他的一些得力干将，以国家机关负责人的身份，亲自到八道湾登门拜访，抬高周作人的身价，借以造成社会舆论，并且告诉公安部门：“以后不要再找周作人的麻烦”。就这样，使这个臭名昭著的大汉奸取得了合法的地位，完全脱离了人民群众和专政机构对他的监督。
    他们包庇周作人的计划实现以后，更加胆大包天，进一步着手对周作人的利用。旧中宣部的常务副部长胡××指示他的娄罗说：“可以出周作人的书”，“他的杂文将来也可以给他出集子”。他们把周作人吹成是一个“中国难得的人才”，说什么他能翻译很多外国作品，而且“文字流畅，语言朴实，可以作为外国文学的教材使用”。其实，他们正需要利用封建主义和资本主义作品来毒害人民，所以远至上古希腊、近至日本明治维新以后的作品，凡有所译，无不收录。据揭发，仅人民文学出版社一个单位，就为这个大汉奸出书十一种，已经译完而没有来得及出版的尚有六种。就这样，胡××、周扬之流，一方面用劳动人民的血汗，以几万元的国家财产，来养活这个帝国主义走狗；另一方面，又让这个汉奸用他肮脏的灵魂，来毒害我们广大的人民和青年学生。
    尤其令人不能容忍的是：中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙为了反革命的需要，打着“红旗”反红旗，放肆地攻击毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》已经“过时”了，鼓吹今后需要有一种“不再带阶级烙印”的，“使任何一个阶级都可以接受”的“全民文艺”，并且利用周作人这个汉奸，打着回忆鲁迅的旗号，来歪曲鲁迅的革命精神。一九五六年，在鲁迅逝世二十周年的时候，由于旧中宣部的大开绿灯，周作人在许多报刊和出版物中大肆放毒。比如中国青年出版社出版的一本名为《帮助读者认识鲁迅、学习鲁迅》的小册子中，周作人就秉承反革命修正主义分子们的意旨，使出了很多卑劣的伎俩，借以欺骗不明真相的青年，麻醉人民群众的革命意志。从这里我们就可以看出他们的用心是多么恶毒。众所周知，鲁迅是一个“空前的民族英雄”，而周作人则是一个每遇风吹草动，就在大门口悬挂太阳旗、改“周宅”为“羽太寓”的洋奴。由于鲁迅对黑暗势力毫不妥协，坚决斗争，所以遭到敌人的嫉恨，先为周作人所不容，被迫从八道湾搬走，后为帝国主义的走狗北洋军阀所通缉，因而远赴厦门，而广州，而上海，转战于敌人的空隙之处，最后居住在南方。而周作人在这本书里，故意篡改历史，别有用心地附录其他人的文章，替自己粉饰一番。文章说：“我家和伯父在北京同居的时候，我年纪很小，等到懂事了，伯父又搬走了，之后他又住上海……”。周作人利用这篇文章，掩饰鲁迅遭受迫害的情况，反而大肆渲染“在同住的时候，我们是很快乐很热闹的大家庭”，极力抹煞革命者和反革命之间的阶级界限，散布反革命的“合二而一”毒素。在《鲁迅与“闰土”》这篇文章的结尾，周作人竟恬不知耻地扬言：“我希望在不远的期间能够往绍兴去走一趟，不但看看故乡在解放后的变化，还可以看看这位‘闰土’的孙子。……因为追怀往事，或者还能记起些遗忘的事情来，给我作回忆文的资料，这也还不至于是完全自私的愿望吧”。这一段极其恶毒。它使一些阅历不深的青年看来，似乎周作人的多年不能返回故乡，并不是由于他彻底背叛人民，出卖祖国，认贼作父，以身事敌，无面再见江东；而是由于公务丛集，日夜繁忙。周作人在这里把自己打扮成一个到晚年才想退休还乡的革命者，好象他对人民没有犯下滔天罪行，倒有很大功劳，对祖国没有背叛，倒有多么深厚的感情似的。真是不识人间尚有“羞耻”二字。一个汉奸，他到底有什么资格来这样玷辱共产党领导下的新文坛，而且竟敢说他制作毒品“不至于是完全自私的愿望”，真是岂有此理！
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一伙反革命修正主义分子推行“全民文艺”的阴谋活动，在苏共二十次代表大会之后达到了疯狂的程度。记得一九五六年十月，正当鲁迅逝世二十周年之际，他们便借纪念鲁迅的名义，在这方面大作文章。开会以前，周扬之流秉承其主子的意旨，拟定题目，指定干将，研究“作为人道主义者和革命民主主义者的鲁迅的世界观的形成”，研究鲁迅作品中“人道主义思想的深刻性”。会议期间，他们不但把一些前清遗老、国民党军阀、三十年代的祖师爷、资产阶级政客、叛徒、特务、右派、流氓、反革命修正主义分子、里通外国分子以及一批资产阶级反动“权威”，塞入大会主席团之内，而且还指定专人，特地陪同大汉奸周作人去出席这个大会。反革命集团的重要头目陆定一，在台上直言不讳地叫嚷：“我们希望全国一切老的和新的文学家艺术家，包括在台湾的文学家艺术家在内，在爱国的口号下团结起来”。请看，他们到底要爱什么样的国家？把大汉奸都拉来让其“爱国”，这不是对他们的一种莫大的讽刺吗？
    当时，周作人简直成了他们手中的一块“宝贝”。在许多文章中，他俨然以研究鲁迅“权威”的面目出现。在一篇文章中，竟公然说关于鲁迅的资料，“我所知道已成为海内孤本，深信值得录存”，并且以此要挟群众，说什么他掌握的这些资料，“有如钞票一样，用掉一张，便少一张”。一小撮反革命修正主义分子，为了让周作人能够放肆放毒，与周作人狼狈为奸，互相利用。并且指示报刊杂志派人向周作人组稿，一时八道湾门庭若市，约稿者络绎不绝，热闹非凡。眼看中国文化革命运动的历史，快要被他们弄得模糊不堪了，鲁迅的战斗精神，被他们损害得很厉害了。一九五九年，我激于义愤，在自己的《鲁迅回忆录中》独辟一章，专门写了《所谓兄弟》，揭露事实真相，使一些年青的读者能够得到一个历史的梗概。但是，由于周扬之流的包庇，大汉奸周作人却并没有受到稍许的触动。
    本来，由于旧中宣部的常务副部长胡××的指使，人民文学出版社的党内走资本主义道路当权派，就以预支稿费的名义，每月给周作人生活费二百元，但是这个大汉奸还嫌给的太少，说每月应给他四百元才行。周扬听到这话以后，马上批准如数照发，把他象猪猡一样的供养起来。三年自然灾害期间，我国广大革命人民和干部，克服由于天灾和苏修给我们带来的困难，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，但是周作人这个大汉奸却得到格外的照顾。有些机关的党内走资本主义道路当权派，为他奉献食品，去探望他的“疾病”。周扬本人更是对他关心备至，爱护有加，外出期间，特意将一叠盖有周扬私章的空白信笺交给周作人，让其随意填写，愿到那里，就到那里，令其为所欲为，满足其各种反动要求。回想起来，周扬之流对周作人如此垂青，而对鲁迅却那样怀恨，又是砍杀著作，又是曲加注解，又是造谣中伤，又是围攻打击，必欲置之死地而后快，这难道是偶然的吗？
    周作人这个汉奸，因为得到中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的包庇和支持，所以每当国内外阶级斗争趋于紧张的时候，他就显得非常活跃。一九五六年苏共二十大以后是这样，一九六二年前后也是这样。在我们国家暂时困难时期，一些反革命修正主义分子又把周作人放出笼来，联合一切牛鬼蛇神向党进攻。当时，被他们安插在鲁迅博物馆当权的叛徒，曾经用一千八百元的高价，收购了周作人的反动日记，作为“文物”保存。许多报刊也纷纷向周作人组稿，让他用“仲密”的化名，向国内外的阶级敌人发出反党的召唤。而且，周作人还不受任何限制，可以为香港的反动报刊自由写稿。当时，有一个拜倒在国民党门下的无耻文人，就在香港大放厥词，攻击我们革命作家用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来论述鲁迅的革命经历和斗争精神，胡说什么大陆上“连许广平也不敢说真话”。他特别卖劲地替周作人吹嘘，说鲁迅史料中的“一部分缺恨，已经由周作人写了《鲁迅的故家》，《鲁迅小说里的人物》填补起来了”，他“尤其期望”着由周作人再写出一本《鲁迅传》来。这批牛鬼蛇神，里应外合，内外夹攻，闹得乌烟瘴气，令人十分忿恨。他们简直把这个大汉奸快要捧上天了。记得鲁迅说过：革命胜利以后，有些先前的叭儿狗，他会挂出新的招牌来掩饰实情，欺骗世界，“这除却与之战斗以外，更无别法”。为了维护革命利益，为了揭露事实真相，我在一九六三年六月七日刊出的一篇文章中，又一次点名揭发周作人在敌伪时期，借口母亲等人生活困难，指使别人将鲁迅藏书编目出售，企图以此来消除鲁迅的影响，压制人民革命精神。文章发表的第二天，即一九六三年六月八日，这个大汉奸便火气十足地向旧《北京晚报》提出抗议，说我的揭发是“一番胡来的诬蔑”。毛主席教导我们说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。我们革命人民根据事实揭发汉奸的罪行，被他说成是“胡来的诬蔑”，那末，他在报刊上放出的毒草，不是正好成了反革命修正主义分子们的“香花”吗？那时，我还不十分理解，他这个民族的败类和国家的蟊贼，为什么竟敢这样气壮腰粗？文化大革命开始以后，我才明白了这个道理。原来他是有靠山的。据揭发，中国赫鲁晓夫的心腹周扬就亲口封过：“周作人从来不曾反对过共产主义”。周作人听到这样美化他的言论以后，立即写信对周扬表示感恩戴德，说：“闻之甚为幸慰”。他有这样一座靠山，怎么能不那样有恃无恐，猖狂反扑呢？
    鲁迅离开我们已经三十一年了。尽管阶级敌人对他不断的围攻，但是他的革命精神却永远鼓舞着人民群众英勇战斗。鲁迅在他逝世前所写的“遗嘱”的最后一条中，曾经这样告诫我们：“损着别人的牙眼，却反对报复，主张宽容的人，万勿和他接近”。中国赫鲁晓夫出于他的反革命需要，却偏偏主张“宽容”，反对报复，反对无产阶级专政，大搞阶级合作。早在一九三六年两个口号论战的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫就站在周扬一边，贩卖这种黑货，胡说什么“更大胆些，更放手些，把门完全打开，抛去一切狭隘的对人‘不容忍’的傲慢的废物，不管什么党派，什么团体，什么样式的人，你们都要去招致来”。甚至公开叫嚷，不要“怕领导权被人抢去，怕受人家利用，怕汉奸来破坏……”等等，等等。三十年的时间虽然过去了，但是中国赫鲁晓夫的爪牙们并没有忘记主子的黑指示，还在更加卖劲地实践他的政治纲领，还在替他“招致”汉奸来从事破坏活动，为他们复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    毛主席教导我们：“划清反动派和革命派的界限，揭露反动派的阴谋诡计，引起革命派内部的警觉和注意，长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，才能孤立反动派，战而胜之，或取而代之。”一小撮反革命修正主义分子的阴险毒辣之处，正在于他们搅乱阶级阵线，篡改历史，颠倒敌我，混淆黑白。解放以后，大汉奸周作人为一小撮反革命修正主义分子所包庇和利用的事实，使我们得出了一条极为重要的教训：划清革命派和反革命派的界限，“扫除一切害人虫”，提高我们的革命警觉性，乃是头等重要的大事。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。为了我们的国家永不变色，为了我们的人民永远幸福，我们一定要响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
