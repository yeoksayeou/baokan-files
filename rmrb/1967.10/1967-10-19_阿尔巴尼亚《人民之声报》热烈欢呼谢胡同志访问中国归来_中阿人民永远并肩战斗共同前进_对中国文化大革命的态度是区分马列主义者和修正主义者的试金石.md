The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" warmly greets the return of the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, from their visit to China. The delegation's visit to China and the publication of the news communiqué on the delegation's visit to China have been hailed.

The title of the editorial in "People's Voice" is: "In the struggle for the realization of socialism and communism, against imperialism and modern revisionism, we will always be united as one." The editorial states: The Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu received extremely cordial and friendly treatment in China. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao met with the delegation and had extremely cordial talks. The delegation held very sincere talks with other Party and Government leaders in China. This once again vividly demonstrated the eternal fraternal friendship and Marxist-Leninist combat unity between the brotherly peoples of Albania and China. This ironclad friendship and unity were forged by our two parties and our outstanding leaders Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong.

The editorial states: The news communiqué of October 14, 1967, reflects the significant and fruitful results of the Albanian Party and Government delegation's visit to China. The talks have once again shown that in the common struggle for the revolutionary and socialist cause, against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, our two parties and governments have completely consistent positions and views based on the same ideology and the correct Marxist-Leninist line. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people highly appreciate the correct Marxist-Leninist line of the Party of Labor of Albania and the revolutionary stance of the Albanian people in their struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and against the Titoist renegade clique. This is a great honor and a tremendous inspiration for the Albanian people. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe." "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." These words of ardent praise for socialist Albania, the Party of Labor of Albania, and the Albanian people highly express the internationalist friendship and revolutionary unity between our two peoples.

The editorial states: No storms or tempests, no enemies can threaten the great combat friendship and revolutionary unity between the peoples, parties, and governments of Albania and China. We have always supported each other. We fight in the same trench, side by side, against our common enemies. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries attacking China is the same as attacking Albania, and attacking Albania is the same as attacking China.

The editorial states: The visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to China, and the brilliant results of this visit, have elevated this friendship and combat unity to a new height. The Albanian people and the Party of Labor of Albania regard their friendship with great China, the Chinese people, and the Communist Party of China as one of their greatest historical victories. The Albanian people will cherish this friendship like the apple of their eye and will strengthen it even more. Our enemies must take this into account. The news communiqué of October 14 on the visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation to China states: "Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries must count China and Albania together. If anyone dares to attack Albania, the Chinese people will be the staunch backbone of the Albanian people."

The editorial states: The visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to China took place at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, was in full swing and achieving great victories. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest event in the history of the Chinese people since the founding of the People's Republic of China eighteen years ago. The essence of this revolution is the issue of state power, and it is also the fundamental issue of revolution in a socialist state under proletarian dictatorship. The historical necessity of this revolution lies in the fact that a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, occupied some important positions in the Party and the state, attempting to make China revert from the socialist road to the capitalist road, and to stage a tragedy similar to that performed by his accomplice, the renegade Khrushchev, in the Soviet Union. However, the fearless proletarian revolutionaries in China, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, under the guidance of the teachings and revolutionary thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, the legitimate successor and heir to the cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, rose up to smash the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. Now, the counter-revolutionary line of the small clique of revisionists within the Chinese Party has been completely smashed. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has entered a new stage. This great revolution is achieving ever-deeper victories. The editorial states: Under the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong to "grasp revolution, promote production," hundreds of millions of workers, members of people's communes, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary intellectuals have been extensively mobilized. Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have displayed unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity, overfulfilled the industrial production plan, achieved record-breaking agricultural harvests, and won new brilliant victories in the fields of science and technology and nuclear capabilities. China today has become a socialist great power with modern industry, developed and collectivized agriculture, scientific and technological levels reaching the world's highest peaks, and tremendous defense potential.

The editorial states: In the fierce class struggle, in the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, a new generation of revolutionaries is being tempered. They are determined to pass on the torch of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought from generation to generation, ensuring that great China will forever remain red.

The editorial states: The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only has great historical significance for the socialist destiny of China but also for the destiny of socialism and revolution in the world. The Albanian Party and Government delegation fully supports the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and emphasizes that the attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the touchstone for distinguishing Marxist-Leninists from revisionists, and true revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries today. This revolution has smashed the revisionist conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang, defended the fruits of socialist victory, and made China stand tall and become the strongest bastion of socialism, a great revolutionary base for the peoples of all countries, and the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism. This revolution has set a great example for the communists and peoples of countries whose parties have been usurped by revisionist cliques, showing them how to rise up in revolution, how to overthrow the revisionist usurpers in the Party and the state, and how to bring their countries back to the socialist road. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China inspires all oppressed peoples in their struggle for national and social liberation, against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. Therefore, the victory of this revolution has made the imperialists and revisionists tremble with fear and panic. The American imperialists and the Brezhnev-Kosygin renegade clique, in collusion with each other, have directed their main spearhead against the People's Republic of China and cursed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This does not indicate their strength but only shows their extreme fear and weakness.

In discussing the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation, the editorial notes that the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people is defeating the counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism and the joint conspiracy of imperialism and revisionism, setting an inspiring example for all anti-imperialist revolutionary forces in the world.

The editorial concludes: The Albanian people, the Party of Labor of Albania, and the Albanian government are honored and proud to have the brotherly Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and the Chinese government as such inseparable comrades. The visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to China is another great contribution to further strengthening the combat friendship and ironclad unity between the brotherly peoples of Albania and China. Under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist parties headed by Comrades Hoxha and Mao Zedong, the peoples of Albania and China will forever advance together in the struggle for the victory of the socialist and communist cause and will carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism to the end.

　　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》热烈欢呼谢胡同志访问中国归来
　　中阿人民永远并肩战斗共同前进
　　对中国文化大革命的态度是区分马列主义者和修正主义者的试金石
    新华社地拉那十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十八日发表社论，热烈欢呼由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国归来和代表团访问中国新闻公报的发表。
    《人民之声报》的社论题目是：《在为实现社会主义和共产主义，反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，永远团结得象一个人一样》。社论说：以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团在中国受到了极其亲切友好的接待。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志会见了代表团，并进行了极其亲切的谈话。代表团同中国党政的其他领导人进行了十分真挚的会谈。这再次生动地体现了兄弟般的阿中两国人民之间国际主义的永恒友谊和马克思列宁主义的战斗团结。这一钢铁般的友谊和团结是由我们两党和我们的杰出领袖霍查同志和毛泽东同志缔造的。
    社论说：一九六七年十月十四日的新闻公报反映了阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访华的卓有成效的和重要的结果。会谈的结果再次表现了在为革命和社会主义事业，反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏联叛徒领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的共同斗争中，我们两党和两国政府建立在共同的思想和马克思列宁主义正确路线基础上的立场和观点的完全一致。中国共产党和中国人民高度评价阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的马克思列宁主义的正确路线，和阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命立场及其反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，反对铁托叛徒集团的斗争。这是阿尔巴尼亚人民的很大的荣誉和对阿尔巴尼亚人民的巨大鼓舞。毛泽东同志说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”“……不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”这些对社会主义阿尔巴尼亚、对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民所说的热情的话，高度表现了我们两国人民的国际主义友谊和革命团结。
    社论说：任何惊涛骇浪和狂风暴雨，任何敌人都不能威胁阿中两国人民、两党和两国政府之间的伟大的战斗友谊和革命团结。我们从来是互相支持的。我们象兄弟和不可分离的战友一样，战斗在一个战壕里，反对共同的敌人。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派反华也就是反对阿尔巴尼亚，反阿尔巴尼亚也就是反华。
    社论说：由谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的访问中国，以及这次访问的辉煌成果，把这种友谊和战斗团结提升到了一个新的高度。阿尔巴尼亚人民和劳动党把同伟大的中国、中国人民和中国共产党的友谊看作是他们最伟大的历史性胜利之一。阿尔巴尼亚人民将象维护眼珠一样维护这一友谊，将愈益加强这一友谊。我们的敌人必须好好地考虑到这一点。十月十四日的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国的新闻公报中说：“帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派必须把中阿两国计算在一起。如果谁胆敢进攻阿尔巴尼亚，中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。”
    社论说：由谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国，是在由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命充分地开展，无产阶级文化大革命取得了巨大胜利的时候进行的。无产阶级文化大革命是中华人民共和国成立十八年来中国人民的最伟大的事件。这场革命的实质是国家政权问题，它也是无产阶级当政的社会主义国家中的革命的根本问题。这场革命的历史必要性取决于这样的事实，即以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派占据了党和国家的一些重要地位，企图使中国从社会主义道路回到资本主义道路，在中国重演他的伙伴叛徒赫鲁晓夫在苏联演出的悲剧。但是中国大无畏的无产阶级革命派，亿万革命群众，在伟大的马克思列宁主义者，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的事业的当之无愧的接班人和继承者毛泽东同志的教导和革命思想的指导下，起来粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的反革命阴谋。现在，中国党内一小撮修正主义分子的反革命阵线已被全面摧垮。中国无产阶级文化大革命已进入了一个新的阶段。这场大革命正在取得日益深刻的胜利。社论说：在毛泽东主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，亿万工人、人民公社社员、人民解放军战士、革命知识分子广泛地动员起来，在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，发挥了空前巨大的积极性和创造力，超额完成了工业生产计划，获得了创纪录的农业丰收，在科技方面、在核能力领域中取得了新的光辉胜利。中国今天已经成为一个具有现代化工业、发达的和集体化的农业、攀登上世界水平最高峰的科学和技术水平、巨大的国防潜力的社会主义大国。
    社论说：在激烈的阶级搏斗中，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中，正在锻炼出一代革命新人。他们保证要把毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的火把一代一代传下去，使伟大的人民中国永不改变鲜红的颜色。
    社论说：无产阶级文化大革命的胜利不仅对于中国的社会主义命运，而且对于全世界社会主义和革命的命运有着巨大的历史意义。阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团表示完全支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，并且强调指出，对中国无产阶级文化大革命采取什么态度，是今天区分马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者，区分真革命和反革命的试金石。这场革命粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙的修正主义阴谋，保卫了社会主义的胜利果实，使中国巍然屹立并成为社会主义的最强大的堡垒，世界各国人民伟大的革命根据地，马克思列宁主义的旗手。这场革命为被修正主义集团篡夺了政权的国家的共产党人和人民作出了伟大的榜样，告诉他们如何起来革命，如何推翻党和国家中的修正主义篡夺者，如何使他们的国家重新回到社会主义的道路上去。中国无产阶级文化革命鼓舞着所有被压迫人民争取民族和社会解放、反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的斗争。因此，这场革命的胜利使帝国主义者和修正主义者怕得要死，惊慌万分。美帝国主义者和勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团狼狈为奸，把它们的主要矛头指向人民中国，并咒骂中国无产阶级文化大革命。这并不表明它们的强大，而只能表明它们吓得要命，表明了它们的虚弱。
    社论在谈到越南人民抗美救国斗争时指出，英雄的越南人民的斗争正在战胜美帝国主义的反革命全球战略和帝国主义、修正主义的共同阴谋，为世界所有反帝革命力量作出了令人鼓舞的榜样。
    社论最后说：阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府为有兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和中国政府这样不可分离的战友而荣幸和自豪。由谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团在中国的访问，是对进一步加强阿中两国兄弟人民之间的战斗友谊和钢铁般的团结的又一巨大贡献。阿中两国人民在以霍查同志和毛泽东同志为首的马克思列宁主义党的领导下，将在争取社会主义和共产主义事业胜利的斗争中，永远共同前进，将把反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
