Japanese renowned philosopher Matsumura Kazuhito on the evening of the 27th at the "Mao Zedong Thought Study Lecture" said: Mao Zedong Thought has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, becoming the ideological foundation of the international communist movement. The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group's attack on Mao Zedong Thought is to split and sabotage the international communist movement; they are the true splitters. This lecture was organized by the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity.

Matsumura pointed out to the audience: The "philosophy of unity" advocated by the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group is a philosophy of revisionism. It is a philosophy of reconciliation with U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, urging the people to give up the revolutionary struggle. They are the true splitters of the international communist movement. No matter how much they wave the banner of Marxism-Leninism, they cannot conceal their corrupt and degenerate nature.

After refuting the fallacies of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group, Matsumura pointed out: Some "theorists" of the Japanese revisionists, like the reactionary writers nurtured by Khrushchev in the Soviet Union and the capitalist-roaders in the Chinese Communist Party like Yang Xianjian, all defend the class contradictions existing in capitalist society. They are against revolution and class struggle. These revisionist "philosophers" advocate that the people should "approach and merge" with U.S. imperialism, beautifying the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism, and urging the people to surrender to U.S. imperialism.

Matsumura exposed the recent vicious attacks on Mao Zedong Thought in the *Akahata* and *Zenshi* publications by the Japanese revisionists and expressed his determination to stand on the Marxist-Leninist position to firmly support and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Matsumura finally called on the Japanese people to further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, to constantly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to thoroughly overthrow U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism.

    日本著名哲学家痛斥日修集团对毛泽东思想的无耻攻击
    毛泽东思想是国际共运的思想基础
    呼吁日本人民用毛泽东思想武装起来打倒美日反动派和现代修正主义
    新华社二十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本著名哲学家松村一人二十七日晚间在“毛泽东思想学习讲演会”上说：毛泽东思想把马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新阶段，成为国际共产主义运动的思想基础。日共修正主义集团对毛泽东思想的攻击，就是为了分裂和破坏国际共产主义运动，它是真正的分裂主义者。这次讲演会是由亚非人民团结日本委员会主办的。
    松村向听众指出：日共修正主义集团所叫嚷的“团结的哲学”，是修正主义的“哲学”，是同美帝国主义和解，同日本反动派和解，要人民群众放弃革命斗争的“哲学”。他们是国际共产主义运动的真正的分裂主义者。不管他们怎样打着马克思列宁主义的招牌，都无法掩盖他们的腐败堕落的原形。
    松村驳斥了日共修正主义集团的谬论后指出：日修的一些“理论家”，同赫鲁晓夫所豢养的苏联反动文人和中国党内走资本主义道路的当权派杨献珍之流一样，都是为资本主义社会中存在的阶级矛盾辩解，都是反对革命和阶级斗争的。这些修正主义的“哲学家”，要人民同美帝国主义“互相接近，互相融合”，美化美帝国主义的侵略政策，劝人民向美帝投降。
    松村揭露了日修最近在《赤旗报》和《前卫》等刊物上恶毒地攻击毛泽东思想的行径，并且表示要站在马克思列宁主义立场上坚决拥护和保卫毛泽东思想。
    松村最后呼吁日本人民进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，经常活学活用毛主席著作，彻底打倒美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义。
