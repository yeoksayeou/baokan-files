Edition: 6

The protagonist of "Quiet Flows the Don," Grigory, is a heinous counter-revolutionary, a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary restorationist, and a vicious enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

This counter-revolutionary wields a blood-stained sabre. With this sabre, he slashes at the Red Cossacks and Red Army soldiers, "in an instant, he beheaded four." With this sabre, he commands a gang of "three thousand," like a madman, charging at the newly born Soviet power, shouting to seize the land from under the Bolsheviks' feet. With this sabre, like a demon, his eyes flashing with ferocity, he screams that the Bolsheviks must not be allowed to live!

As a representative of the counter-revolutionary class, Grigory attempts to use his sabre to overthrow the newly born dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism!

The powerful dictatorship of the proletariat smashes Grigory and his sabre to smithereens. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people and soldiers crushed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, teaching those who brandished sabres and were once arrogant a harsh lesson with their gun barrels. Their dream of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat with a "sabre" was shattered!

However, these "Grigorys" who dream day and night of reclaiming their lost "paradise" will never lay down their butcher's knives. After the new Soviet power is consolidated, they wield another "butcher's knife" with tenfold ferocity and a hundredfold hatred—the pen, which poisons the souls of revolutionary people.

Sholokhov, this "representative of the kulaks and foreign nobility," is a Grigory who wields a pen.

With his pen, he wipes clean all the blood on Grigory, dressing him up as a lamb with a heart "as soft as dough," urging people to "love" and "sympathize" with him. With his pen, he fabricates lies about the Soviet power "oppressing the Cossacks like wolves," forcing Grigory to "groan" onto the road to ruin. With his pen, he relentlessly throws mud at the Red Soviet led by Lenin and Stalin, shouting to "overthrow the Soviet power," making people live "as before."

Sholokhov, with his black pen, stirs up a torrent of capitalist restorationist filth in "Quiet Flows the Don," eroding the foundations of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

This Sholokhov is a counter-revolutionary ten times more vicious and dangerous than Grigory!

The pen in Sholokhov's hand is a soft blade aimed at the dictatorship of the proletariat. This soft blade kills without spilling blood, achieving what Grigory's sabre could not. Sholokhov wields it, commanding a large group of "Grigorys" with pens, attacking the Bolshevik power created by Lenin and Stalin, helping Khrushchev to "overthrow" a Soviet power with a forty-year history. Now, under the rule of the new tsars in the Kremlin, the Soviet people are living like cattle again. On Red Square in Moscow, the "Grigorys" have once again brandished their blood-stained sabres, slaughtering revolutionary people at will, as before. This is the most painful lesson from the history of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Against the "Grigorys" who wield sabres, the dictatorship of the proletariat must be enforced; against the "Grigorys" who wield pens, the dictatorship of the proletariat must also be enforced—this is the conclusion we draw from this historical lesson.

    葛利高里的马刀和肖洛霍夫的笔
    解放军某部　胜文
    《静静的顿河》的主人公——葛利高里，是一个罪大恶极的反革命分子，是一个彻头彻尾的反革命复辟狂，是无产阶级专政的凶恶的敌人。
    这个反革命分子，手中有一把血腥的马刀。他舞着这把刀，杀向红色的哥萨克和红军战士，“一刹那就砍死了四个”。他舞着这把刀，指挥着“三千人”的匪帮，“象疯子一样”，扑向新生的苏维埃政权，叫嚷要从布尔什维克的“脚底下”把土地“夺过来”。他舞着这把刀，就象一个恶魔，眼里“闪出凶狠的光”，叫喊着不能让布尔什维克“留活命”！
    作为反革命阶级的代表人物，这个葛利高里妄图用马刀来推翻新生的无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟！
    强大的无产阶级专政，把葛利高里之流和他们的马刀砸得稀巴烂。在列宁和斯大林领导下的苏联军民，粉碎了反革命叛乱，用枪杆子狠狠地教训了那些挥舞马刀、嚣张一时的“葛利高里”。他们企图用“马刀”推翻无产阶级专政的美梦破产了！
    但是，这些日夜梦想夺回他们失去了的“天堂”的“葛利高里”，是决不肯放下屠刀的。在新生的苏维埃政权巩固下来后，他们更以十倍的凶狠、百倍的仇恨舞起了另一把“屠刀”——毒害革命人民灵魂的笔杆子。
    肖洛霍夫这个“富农与外国的贵族的代表人物”，就是一个拿着笔杆子的“葛利高里”。
    他挥着笔杆子，把葛利高里浑身的血迹抹得一干二净，把他打扮成一只心“象面团一样软”的“羔羊”，要人们去“爱”他，“同情他”。他挥着笔杆子，胡说苏维埃政权“象狼一样”“压迫哥萨克”，逼得葛利高里“呻吟着”走上绝路。他挥着笔杆子，拚命朝列宁斯大林领导下的红色苏维埃泼污水，叫嚷要“把苏维埃政权栽倒”，让人们还象“从前那样”过日子。
    肖洛霍夫用他的黑笔杆在《静静的顿河》这条臭水沟里掀起了一股股复辟资本主义的恶流浊浪，冲击无产阶级专政的墙脚。
    这个肖洛霍夫是个比葛利高里还凶恶十倍、危险十倍的反革命分子！
    肖洛霍夫手里的笔杆子是杀向无产阶级专政的软刀子。这把软刀子，杀人不见血，起到了葛利高里的马刀不能起的作用。肖洛霍夫舞着它，指挥着一大群拿笔杆的“葛利高里”，杀向列宁斯大林亲手缔造的布尔什维克政权，帮助赫鲁晓夫把一个有四十年历史的苏维埃政权“栽倒”了。现在，在克里姆林宫里的新沙皇统治下，苏联人民又象“从前那样”过着当牛马的日子了。在莫斯科红场上，“葛利高里”们又重新亮出了血腥的马刀，象从前一样任意残杀革命人民了。这是无产阶级专政最沉痛的历史教训！
    对拿马刀的“葛利高里”必须实行无产阶级专政，对拿笔杆的“葛利高里”也必须实行无产阶级专政——这就是我们从这个历史教训中得到的一个结论。
