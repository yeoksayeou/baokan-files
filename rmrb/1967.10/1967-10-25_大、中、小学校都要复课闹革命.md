Resuming classes and making revolution is an urgent need for the development of the Cultural Revolution to this stage, and it is also the common wish of revolutionary teachers and students and the revolutionary masses.

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," personally drafted by Chairman Mao, known as the Sixteen Points, points out: "Reforming the old educational system, reforming the old teaching policies and methods, is an extremely important task of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

In his directive of May 7, 1966, Chairman Mao pointed out the fundamental direction for the educational revolution: "Students are the same. They should focus on learning, but also learn other things, that is, not only learn literature, but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue."

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. After more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists on the educational front have been exposed, and the revisionist educational line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev has been criticized by the masses. This has cleared the way for reforming the old educational system and old teaching policies and methods. Under these circumstances, all schools can and should shift from stopping classes to make revolution to resuming classes to make revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students should concentrate their efforts on the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their own schools.

Carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within one's own school and completing the reform of teaching is a monumental task. We must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of revolutionary teachers and students. We must raise high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and let everyone think and find ways.

Reforming teaching must be combined with teaching practice. We must teach while reforming. Without teaching practice, we won't know how to reform. Chairman Mao teaches us: "...If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and taste it yourself." Only through teaching practice, through mass discussion, criticism, revolution, and creation, can we implement Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, understand the laws of educational revolution under the socialist system, and gradually propose revolutionary plans for the teaching system and teaching content.

Resuming classes and making revolution, and doing a good job of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools, is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, and a struggle between two worldviews. All schools must seriously implement Chairman Mao's great directive on fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, educate every revolutionary teacher and student to fiercely fight against the "self" in their minds, with a high sense of proletarian revolutionary responsibility, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, and firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Against the sabotage activities of class enemies, all revolutionary comrades must remain vigilant.

Grasping the fundamental issue of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism means grasping the political and ideological work among revolutionary teachers and students and deepening the criticism of the revisionist educational line. In this way, resuming classes and making revolution can be done well, and the educational revolution can be implemented.

During the process of resuming classes and making revolution, revolutionary mass organizations in each school and revolutionary Red Guards must follow Chairman Mao's March 7 directive, learn from the experience of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School, achieve great unity under revolutionary principles, according to the teaching system of classes, grades, and departments, help revolutionary cadres and teachers to come forward, and establish a revolutionary three-in-one leading cadre group.

In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, revolutionary teachers and cadres should always remember that their work is related to the great cause of cultivating proletarian revolutionary successors. They should have the courage and determination to thoroughly criticize the old educational system and completely break with their bourgeois worldview. They should recognize that they are educators and also being educated. Students have many places where they are more advanced than themselves. They should go to the students, blend in with the students, and establish a new type of teacher-student relationship under socialism.

Resuming classes and making revolution should also implement the principles of self-reliance and thrift, advocating simplicity and solving problems with everyone's efforts. Students should be educated to cherish state property. Parents should also cooperate with the school to strengthen the political and ideological education of their children.

Completing the task of the proletarian educational revolution is a magnificent and great cause. We must use Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts as a weapon, be brave pioneers of the educational revolution, bravely break through obstacles, fearlessly, with courage and strategy, steadfastly, dare to break away from the bourgeois old frameworks that violate Mao Zedong Thought, dare to propose new socialist educational systems, new teaching content, and new teaching methods that conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Through repeated revolutionary practice, we will continuously summarize experience and establish a red and shining proletarian educational system that radiates the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 大、中、小学校都要复课闹革命

    大、中、小学校都要复课闹革命
    复课闹革命，是无产阶级文化大革命发展到现阶段的迫切需要，也是广大革命师生和广大革命群众的共同愿望。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，即十六条指出：“改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法，是这场无产阶级文化大革命的一个极其重要的任务。”
    毛主席在一九六六年五月七日所作的纲领性指示，为教育革命指出了根本方向：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。经过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，教育战线上的一小撮反革命修正主义分子被揪出来了，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线受到了群众性的批判，这就为改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法扫清了道路。在这种情况下，各个学校完全可能和需要由停课闹革命转入复课闹革命，广大革命师生应当集中力量进行本学校的斗、批、改。
    进行本学校的斗、批、改，完成教学改革，是一个艰巨的任务。必须相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，发挥广大革命师生的积极性和创造性，高举毛泽东思想的革命红旗，大家来动脑筋，想办法。
    改革教学，必须同教学实践相结合，一边进行教学，一边进行改革。离开了教学实践，就不知道怎么改。毛主席教导我们：“……你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”只有在教学的实践中，经过群众性的讨论、批判、革命和创造，我们才能贯彻实行毛主席的教育革命思想，认识在社会主义制度下教育革命的规律，逐步提出教学制度和教学内容的革命方案。
    复课闹革命，搞好学校的斗、批、改，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是两种世界观的斗争。各学校必须认真执行毛主席关于斗私，批修的伟大指示，教育每一个革命师生狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，以高度的无产阶级革命责任感，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。对于阶级敌人的破坏活动，一切革命同志务必保持警惕。
    抓住斗私，批修这个根本问题，就要抓紧对革命师生的政治思想工作，抓紧对修正主义教育路线的深入批判，这样，复课闹革命就能够搞好，教育革命就会落实。
    在复课闹革命的过程中，各个学校的革命群众组织，各个学校革命的红卫兵，要遵照毛主席的“三·七”指示，学习天津延安中学的经验，在革命的原则下，按照教学的班、级、系的系统，实现革命的大联合，帮助革命的干部和教师站出来，建立革命三结合的领导班子。
    在复课闹革命中，革命教师和革命干部应该时刻想到，自己所从事的事业是关系到培养无产阶级革命接班人的大事，应该有勇气有决心对旧的教育制度彻底批判，同自己的资产阶级世界观彻底决裂。应该认识到，自己是教育者，同时也是受教育者，学生有很多比自己高明的地方。要到学生中去，和学生打成一片，建立社会主义的新型的师生关系。
    复课闹革命，也要贯彻自力更生、勤俭节约的原则，提倡因陋就简，大家动手，解决教材和设备问题。要教育学生爱护国家财产。家长也要配合学校，加强对子女的政治思想教育。
    完成无产阶级教育革命的任务，是一个豪迈伟大的事业。我们要以毛主席的教育革命思想为武器，做教育革命勇敢的闯将，披荆斩棘，无所畏惧，有勇有谋，坚韧不拔，敢于破除违反毛泽东思想的那种资产阶级的旧框框，敢于提出符合毛泽东思想的新的社会主义教育制度、新的教学内容、新的教学方法，实践、认识，再实践、再认识，在反复的革命实践中，不断地总结经验，建立起一个红彤彤的闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级教育制度。
