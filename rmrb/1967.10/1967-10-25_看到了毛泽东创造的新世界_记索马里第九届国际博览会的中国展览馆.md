From September 28 to October 12, the grand and magnificent People's Republic of China Pavilion at the Ninth International Trade Fair held in the Somali capital of Mogadishu was the focal point of attention for the Somali audience. During the fair, as soon as night fell, crowds would surge towards the Chinese red exhibition hall. Here, the Somali people saw the miracle of workers in Daqing extracting oil from the wilderness, the courage of the members of Dazhai in transforming the land, the glorious achievements of China's scientific workers in scaling scientific heights, and the spirit of the Chinese people who are carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. More importantly, they saw the source of such great creativity and high revolutionary spirit—the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. Here, visitors eagerly sought Mao's works, many holding the "Little Red Book" and eagerly taking photos in front of Mao's statue, while others shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" They said: We are very happy to have such a good opportunity to see the new world created by Mao Zedong. They said: We have seen how great Mao Zedong Thought has turned into a tremendous material force. "China is the example for all peoples oppressed by imperialism and old and new colonialism. We also hope that one day we can follow the path of the Chinese people."

A young visitor wrote in the guestbook with deep emotion, calling the Chinese Pavilion "a rising sun" at this trade fair. Here, the brilliant light of great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the hearts of the Somali people.

"Back to Beijing Again"

A group of Somali artists, wearing Mao badges and red guards armbands, entered the exhibition hall. They had returned from China just two months ago. As soon as they arrived, seeing the various exhibits, they excitedly chatted non-stop with their companions. They themselves were immersed in the beautiful memories of their visit to China. Some said: "Wearing Mao badges and red guards armbands, entering this red exhibition hall, makes me think of the revolutionary friendship I forged with Chinese revolutionary cultural workers during my visit to China."

It was precisely out of their admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people and their deep affection for the Chinese people that these artists treated the members of the Chinese exhibition team as family. They gathered in front of the tall statue of Chairman Mao, holding high the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing "The East Is Red," "Long Live Chairman Mao," and their self-composed "Praise Chairman Mao" over and over again, shouting slogans like "Long live Sino-Somali friendship!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" An artist told the reporter: "We feel as if we have returned to the center of the world revolution—Beijing. This is so exciting!"

"Long Live Chairman Mao!"

The Somali people's eager desire for Mao's works and Mao badges was evident everywhere.

On the first day of the fair, many Somali visitors rushed to the "Mao Zedong Thought Reading Room" in the Chinese Pavilion. The hundreds of books of Mao's works displayed there were quickly taken away. Two young people who had just obtained "Quotations from Chairman Mao" held up the red book in front of Mao's portrait and excitedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

A disabled Somali person obtained a Mao badge and a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the Chinese exhibition team members. He immediately wore the Mao badge, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and excitedly, though with difficulty, toured the entire exhibition hall amidst the endless stream of people.

An officer, after carefully examining various exhibits and pictures of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, asked the Chinese friends in the exhibition hall for Mao's works. After his wish was fulfilled, he happily said: "It is Chairman Mao who created New China. Chairman Mao is the giant of our times. The people need such a great leader."

One day, two Italian airline personnel, sweating profusely, came to the Chinese Pavilion. It turned out they had come specifically to get "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They told a Chinese worker: "You must give us two copies of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' We are leaving Mogadishu early tomorrow. You know how difficult it is to get a copy of Mao's works elsewhere!"

Among the many exhibits, the machine producing Mao plastic badges constantly attracted large crowds because everyone wanted to get a Mao plastic badge. Many people waited by the machine for a long time until they got the Mao badge they hoped for.

Inside and outside the exhibition hall, each Chinese worker was surrounded by crowds asking for Mao badges countless times. A mother with five daughters asked a worker for Mao badges. After the worker gave them each one, the mother and daughters all showed happy smiles.

"We Urgently Need Mao Zedong Thought"

"All the achievements of China are due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao." This was the common conclusion of many Somali friends after visiting the Chinese Pavilion. During the two-week exhibition, many visitors wrote in the guestbook beautiful praise for the Chinese Pavilion, reflecting the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries, and expressing their boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people.

One visitor wrote: "Mao Zedong represents the will of the people who want to be liberated from slavery. Long live Chairman Mao! May the great Chinese people prosper!"

Another visitor wrote: "All the achievements of China come from the thought of our era's great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, Mao Zedong. Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Another visitor wrote: "No matter how much imperialism and modern revisionism hate China and the great leader of the Chinese people, we oppressed peoples regard Chairman Mao as our true leader, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. Long live the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao!"

Another wrote: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has brought about tremendous changes in China. The people have exposed the enemies hidden within the party. Those who attack this great revolution are precisely the revisionists and imperialists. But the people of the world support this revolution and will advance along this path."

A Somali friend expressed the wish of all visitors in the guestbook. He wrote: "We urgently need Mao Zedong Thought!"

New China News Agency reporter photographed Somali youth eagerly studying Mao's quotations. The picture shows them seriously studying this quotation in front of the quotation board: "All the peoples of the world, unite! Beat back the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and press on! Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed."

    看到了毛泽东创造的新世界
    ——记索马里第九届国际博览会的中国展览馆	初升的太阳
    从九月二十八日到十月十二日在索马里首都摩加迪沙市举办的索马里第九届国际博览会上，宏伟、壮丽的中华人民共和国展览馆，始终是索马里观众瞩目的中心。博览会期间，每当夜幕降临，人潮便涌向中国的红色展览馆。在这里，索马里人民看到大庆的工人在荒原上开采出石油的奇迹，看到大寨的社员改天换地的魄力，看到新中国的科学工作者在攀登科学高峰方面所取得的光辉成就，也看到正在开展史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民的精神面貌。更重要的是他们看到了产生如此伟大创造力和高昂的革命精神的源泉——光焰无际的毛泽东思想。在这里，观众们争先恐后地索取毛主席著作，许多人手捧《毛主席语录》争相在毛主席的塑像前摄影留念，同时又有多少人在高呼“毛主席万岁！”他们说：我们十分高兴能有这样一个绝好的机会看到毛泽东所创造的新世界。他们说：我们看到了伟大的毛泽东思想变成了巨大的物质力量。“中国是一切受帝国主义和新老殖民主义压迫的人民的榜样，我们也希望有一天能走中国人民的道路。”
    一位小观众在留言簿上深情地把中国馆称为本届博览会上的“一轮初升的太阳”。在这里，伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，照亮了索马里人民的心。
      “又回到了北京”
    一群胸佩毛主席像章、臂戴红卫兵袖章的索马里艺术家们走进了展览馆。他们两个月前才从中国访问归来。他们一来到这里，看到各种展品，就兴奋地滔滔不绝地给同伴们讲解。他们自己也沉浸在访问中国时的美好回忆中。有的说：“我们戴着毛主席像章和红卫兵袖章，走进了这座红色的展览馆，就使我想起了访问中国时，同中国革命文艺工作者所结下的战斗友谊。”
    正是出于对中国人民的伟大领袖的爱戴和对中国人民的深情厚谊，这些艺术家们同中国展览团人员亲如家人。他们聚在高大的毛主席塑像前，高举着红色宝书《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地放声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《东方红》、《万岁，毛主席》和他们自编的《歌颂毛主席》等歌曲，一遍又一遍地高呼“索中人民友谊万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号。一位艺术家对记者说：“我们又象回到了世界革命的中心——北京，这太令人兴奋了！”
      “毛主席万岁！”
    索马里人民渴求毛主席著作和毛主席像章的生动事例到处都是。
    博览会开幕的第一天，许多索马里观众拥到中国馆的“毛主席著作阅览室”。陈列在那里的几百本毛主席著作，顷刻之间就被拿空。两位刚拿到《毛主席语录》的青年，对着毛主席像，举起红色宝书激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    一位索马里残废者从中国展览团工作人员那里得到了一枚毛主席像章和一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。他立刻戴上毛主席像章，手拿《毛主席语录》，兴奋地在川流不息的人群中吃力地，但毫不畏难地参观了整个展览馆。
    一位军官在详细地看了各种展品和中国无产阶级文化大革命的图片之后，便向展览馆的中国朋友索取毛主席著作。在他的愿望得到了满足之后，高兴地说：“是毛主席缔造了新中国。毛主席是我们时代的巨人。人民需要这样的伟大领袖。”
    有一天，两位跑得满头大汗的意大利民航人员来到了中国馆。原来他们是特地来要《毛主席语录》的。他们对一位中国工作人员说：“你一定要给我们两本《毛主席语录》。我们明天一早就要离开摩加迪沙。你知道，在别的地方要得到一本毛主席著作是多么不容易啊！”
    在许多展品中，生产毛主席塑料像章的机器，经常吸引着大批观众，因为谁都想得到一枚毛主席的塑料像章。许多人在机器旁长时间地等待着，直到得到他所希望的毛主席像章为止。
    展览馆内外每个中国工作人员不知多少次被索取毛主席像章的人群所包围。一位母亲带着五个女儿向一位工作人员要毛主席像章。工作人员一一给她们戴上了毛主席像章之后，母女都露出了幸福的笑容。
      我们急需毛泽东思想
    “中国所取得的一切成就，都是因为有了毛主席的正确领导。”这是许多索马里朋友参观了中国馆之后得出的共同结论。在两周的展览中，许多观众在留言簿上写下了对中国馆的美好的赞辞，体现了索中两国人民的战斗友谊，表达了对中国人民的伟大领袖的无限敬爱。
    一位观众写道：“毛泽东代表了要从奴役下解放出来的人民的意志。祝毛主席万寿无疆！祝伟大的中国人民繁荣富强。”
    一位观众写道：“中国的一切成就都是来源于我们时代的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛泽东的思想。伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
    另一位观众写道：“不论帝国主义和现代修正主义如何仇恨中国和中国人民伟大的领袖，我们被压迫人民认为毛主席是我们的真正领袖，是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席万岁！”
    又一位写道：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命使中国发生了巨大的变化，人民揭露了隐藏在党内的敌人。攻击这次伟大革命的正是那些修正主义者和帝国主义者。而世界人民都拥护这次大革命，并将沿着这条道路前进。”
    一位索马里朋友在留言簿上表达了所有观众的意愿。他写道：“我们急需毛泽东思想！”
                （新华社摩加迪沙二十四日电）（附图片）
    索马里青年热心学习毛主席语录。图是他们在语录牌前认真学习这样一条语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
