According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 18th, after the issuance of the notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on implementing revolutionary great unity by system, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and people's liberation army fighters stationed on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" across the country enthusiastically cheered and immediately began to study, discuss, and implement the notice seriously. They said, this is a new combat order issued by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, a part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, and under revolutionary principles, unconditionally implement revolutionary great unity by system, by industry, and by class, so as to better promote the revolutionary tripartite alliance, deepen the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-reform of their own units, and do well in promoting revolution, production, work, and preparedness, striving for the thorough victory of the Cultural Revolution.
