The essence of "civilized production"

The Chinese Khrushchev vehemently opposes the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, maliciously slandering the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works as "formalism," and setting up numerous rules and regulations to obstruct the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works in every possible way. A small clique within our factory who are taking the capitalist road, following the black directives of the Chinese Khrushchev, are sparing no effort to oppose our workers studying Chairman Mao's works. "Civilized production" is one of their despicable tactics.

What is "civilized production"? It is using "neat workshops," "clean windows and machines," and "concentrated attention" as excuses to forbid us workers from posting Chairman Mao's quotations and propaganda posters in the workshop, and to forbid the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. What is even more infuriating is that these people actually include these things as conditions for awards. If there is even a slight "mess," it is deemed "uncivilized," and wages will be deducted.

Originally, matters such as arranging the workshop environment have different likes and dislikes for the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. We workers posting Chairman Mao's quotations in the workshop is like Chairman Mao himself standing by our side. We work with all our might. However, in the eyes of those in power taking the capitalist road, this is "uncivilized." Their "civilization," in essence, is to bind workers to the machines, treating workers as speaking machines, not allowing workers to study Chairman Mao's quotations, not allowing workers to revolt. This is bourgeois civilization, a thorough bourgeois dictatorship!

A small clique within the party taking the capitalist road wants to put this shackle of "civilized production" on our necks, pfft, they won't succeed! The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought is forever unshackled. The more the enemy fears us studying Chairman Mao's quotations, the more we must study, study every day, study every year, study until old age, and use it until old age, so that the enemy's plot will never succeed!

    “文明生产”的实质
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力反对活学活用毛主席著作，恶毒污蔑学习毛主席著作的群众运动是“形式主义”，并规定了许多条条框框，千方百计阻挠学习毛主席著作的群众运动。我们厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指示，挖空心思反对我们工人学习毛主席著作。“文明生产”，就是他们卑鄙手法之一。
    “文明生产”是什么货色？就是用“车间美观”、“窗明机净”、“全神贯注”为名，不许我们工人在车间里张贴毛主席语录和宣传画，不许宣传毛泽东思想。更令人气愤的是，这些家伙竟将这些也列入评奖的条件之一，如稍有“不整洁”，就是“不文明”，就得扣奖金。
    原来，象布置车间的环境这样的事情，无产阶级和资产阶级的爱憎也是不同的。我们工人在车间贴上毛主席语录，就好比毛主席他老人家站在我们身旁，我们干起活来，就浑身是劲。然而，这在那些走资本主义道路当权派看来，就是不“文明”。他们的“文明”，说穿了，就是将工人束缚在机器上，把工人当作会说话的机器，不许工人学习毛主席语录，不准工人革命。这是资产阶级的文明，是地地道道的资产阶级专政！
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派妄想把“文明生产”这个枷锁套在我们脖子上，呸，办不到！用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级是永远锁不住的。敌人越害怕我们学习毛主席语录，我们越是要学，天天学，年年学，学到老，用到老，叫敌人的阴谋永远不能得逞！
