A delegation from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, led by combat hero Nguyen Van Dan, visited the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army this morning. They were warmly and enthusiastically welcomed by the officers and soldiers of the fleet.

The docks of the fleet were adorned with red flags and the sound of drums and gongs filled the air. The ships moored at the docks were festooned with flags and signal flags welcoming the distinguished guests. The officers and soldiers stood in formation on the ships and docks, welcoming their comrades from the front lines of the anti-American struggle.

The Vietnamese comrades from the South boarded the 227, a ship that our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao had inspected. They eagerly listened as the ship's officers and soldiers recounted the ship's glorious history. The officers and soldiers of the fleet presented precious commemorative badges to the Vietnamese comrades from the South. The badges bore Chairman Mao's personal inscription on the ship: "To oppose imperialist aggression, we must build a powerful navy."

After the visit, the Chinese and Vietnamese comrades gathered for a friendly discussion. Vietnamese combat heroes Le Chi Vuong and Nguyen Ngoc Bich shared their heroic tales of defeating American aggressors with their Chinese comrades. Combat heroes from the East Sea Fleet who participated in the Chongwu Sea Battle recounted how they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and displayed a fearless and tenacious fighting spirit to sink the Kuomintang warships. East Sea Fleet leader Mei Jia Sheng expressed the determination to learn from the Vietnamese people's daring and victorious revolutionary spirit in their anti-American national salvation war, and to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression.

After the discussion, the Vietnamese comrades from the South boarded the ship to tour the mouth of the Yangtze River.

In the afternoon, the Vietnamese comrades from the South also watched a military performance by the Shanghai People's Militia. The performance featured male and female militia members and Red Guards from various fronts, including farmers in their fifties and students in their teens. They performed seventeen items with skillful and precise movements, achieving outstanding results and fully demonstrating the invincible power of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war. Their performance was highly praised by the Vietnamese comrades from the South.

    舰队的码头上，今天，红旗林立，锣鼓喧天。停泊在码头的舰艇上挂满旗，并悬挂热烈欢迎贵宾的信号旗。指战员们列队在舰艇和码头上，欢迎来自反美斗争最前线的亲密战友。
    越南南方战友登上了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席曾经视察过的二二七舰，他们兴奋地听舰上指战员介绍了这艘军舰的光荣历史。舰队的指战员把珍贵的纪念章赠给越南南方战友，纪念章上有着毛主席在这艘军舰上的亲笔题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”
