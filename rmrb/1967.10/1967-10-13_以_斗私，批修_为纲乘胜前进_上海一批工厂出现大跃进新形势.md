With "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the Main Task, Advance with Victory

A number of factories in Shanghai show a new leap-forward situation

	Broad masses of workers determined to launch a greater production upsurge in the fourth quarter and strive to better fulfill this year's national plan

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for production development. Since this year, the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary workers on the industrial front in Shanghai, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, have bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. They have vigorously grasped revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving great victories on both the revolutionary and production fronts. Currently, the Shanghai working class is determined to take "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the main task, advance with victory, and launch a greater production upsurge in the fourth quarter to better fulfill this year's national plan.

	Recently, good news has been frequently reported on the industrial front in Shanghai. A number of factories have shown a new leap-forward situation. The revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary people of Shanghai Pujiang Machine Tool Factory, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great line of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," have taken revolutionary criticism as the main task, fiercely criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and at the same time, boldly liberated revolutionary cadres, mobilizing all positive factors. They have achieved victories in both revolution and production. On September 29, the factory completed this year's production task one quarter ahead of schedule. The production of machine tools and the total output value both increased compared to last year, and a new type of surface grinder was successfully trial-produced. This new product is now in small-batch production. Shanghai Iron Alloy Factory completed the national plan for quality, quantity, and product specifications on time every month from January to September this year. The total output value and total output both increased by more than 4% and 13% respectively compared to the same period last year. The daily production level of main products increased by more than 9% compared to the same period last year. The revolutionary workers of Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, after overfulfilling the national plan in August, continued to grasp revolution and vigorously promote production. They completed the September production task two days ahead of schedule. The entire factory also implemented 20 major technological innovation projects, universally improving labor productivity.

	In the high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production, some factories have made new achievements in saving and revolutionizing. After criticizing the "creeping philosophy" of the Chinese Khrushchev, some factories have successfully trial-produced a batch of new products. The revolutionary masses of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant united with broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres to not only overfulfill the total output value and steel production plan for January to August this year, achieving more than 90% of the products with stable and improved quality, but also successfully trial-produced 125 new products urgently needed by the state. Recently, the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Dongfanghong Boiler Factory independently designed and successfully trial-produced a small industrial boiler with a new structure, high efficiency, steel-saving, high automation level, and capable of burning low-quality coal—"Dongfanghong" boiling combustion boiler. Through more than half a year of trial operation, it was proven that the quality of this boiler completely meets the design requirements. Due to the reduced size of the boiler, the investment in factory building construction was reduced, the metal consumption was only one-third of the old-style boiler, and the design efficiency was increased by about 11%. At the same time, due to the addition of new automatic control equipment, the labor intensity of the boiler operators was greatly reduced.

　　以“斗私，批修”为纲乘胜前进
　　上海一批工厂出现大跃进新形势
    广大职工决心在第四季度掀起更大的生产高潮，争取更多更好地完成今年国家计划
    据新华社上海电无产阶级文化大革命是推动生产发展的强大动力。今年以来，上海工业战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在人民解放军驻沪三军的有力支援下，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在革命、生产两条战线上都取得了巨大胜利。目前，上海工人阶级决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，乘胜前进，在第四季度掀起一个更大的生产高潮，争取更多更好地完成今年的国家计划。
    最近，上海工业战线上捷报频传，一批工厂已出现新的大跃进形势。上海浦江机床厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指导下，以革命大批判为纲，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，同时大胆解放革命干部，调动各方面的积极因素，取得了革命、生产双胜利。在九月二十九日，这个厂提前一个季度完成了全年的生产任务，机床的产量和总产值都比去年有所增长，还试制成功一种平面磨床，这种新产品现在已开始小批生产。上海铁合金厂今年一月至九月，月月按质、按量、按品种规格全面完成国家计划，总产值和总产量分别比去年同期增长百分之四和百分之十三以上，主要产品的日产水平比去年同期提高百分之九以上。上海柴油机厂革命职工继八月份超额完成了国家计划以后，再接再厉，狠抓革命，猛促生产，又提前两天完成了九月份生产任务。全厂还实现了二十项较大的技术革新项目，使劳动生产率普遍提高。
    在抓革命、促生产的高潮中，有些工厂在节约闹革命方面做出了新成绩；有的工厂在批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“爬行哲学”之后，试制成功一批新产品。上钢三厂无产阶级革命派团结广大革命职工和革命干部，不但超额完成了今年一至八月份的总产值和钢材生产计划，做到百分之九十以上的产品质量稳定和提高，而且还试制成功一百二十五种国家急需的新产品。上海东方红锅炉厂革命职工最近自行设计、试制成功了一台结构新、效率高、节省钢材、自动化水平高、可燃烧劣质煤的小型工业锅炉——“东方红”号沸腾燃烧锅炉。通过半年多的试运行证明，这台锅炉的质量完全符合设计要求，由于锅炉体积缩小，减少了厂房基本建设投资，金属耗用量仅为旧式锅炉的三分之一，设计效率却提高了百分之十一左右。同时由于增加了新型的自动控制设备，大大减轻了司炉的劳动强度。
