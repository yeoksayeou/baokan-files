Title: What "Roots" to Plant? With Whom to "Connect"?

Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and supports the masses the most. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, from his reactionary class standpoint, harbors extreme hostility towards the masses and has always opposed revolutionary mass movements. In his "Peach Garden Experience" black goods, the Chinese Khrushchev depicts the socialist new countryside as a pitch-black "enemy-occupied area," slandering the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as "selfish," "backward" "cunning" elements, all of whom are untrustworthy and unreliable. Thus, he advocates "planting roots and connecting." His wife, the bourgeois element Wang X, in Peach Garden, carried out "planting roots and connecting," which was a major betrayal of Chairman Mao's mass line, a major promotion of secrecy, a gathering of cronies, a cultivation of followers, and the use of these henchmen to suppress the masses, driving down good and relatively good revolutionary cadres, and turning Peach Garden into a black stronghold for the restoration of capitalism.

　　扎什么“根”？同谁“串连”？
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最支持群众。而中国赫鲁晓夫出于他的反动的阶级立场，极端仇视群众，一贯反对革命的群众运动。中国赫鲁晓夫在他的“桃园经验”黑货中，把社会主义的新农村描写成漆黑一团的“敌占区”，把广大贫下中农诬蔑为“自私”、“落后”的“奸诈”之徒，统统信不过，靠不住，于是就来一个“扎根串连”。他的老婆、资产阶级分子王××在桃园搞的“扎根串连”，就是大反毛主席的群众路线，大搞神秘化，拉拢心腹，培植党羽，利用这些打手，镇压群众，把好的和比较好的革命干部打下去，把桃园变成复辟资本主义的黑据点。
