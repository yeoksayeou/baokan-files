The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Shanghai, along with the soldiers and officers of the land, sea, and air forces stationed in the city, are earnestly studying and resolutely implementing the series of extremely important instructions given by the great leader Chairman Mao during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China. Currently, a widespread mass movement to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions is vigorously unfolding across the entire city. All sectors and industries in Shanghai are using "criticize revisionism and repudiate selfishness" as the key link, intensively studying the works of Chairman Mao, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further clarifying the current excellent situation, consolidating and developing revolutionary unity, the revolutionary three-in-one combination, further improving revolutionary criticism, and carrying out rectification in their own units to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee has seriously studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, on October 3, issued a notice on resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, calling for an immediate large-scale study movement throughout the city to ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions bloom and bear fruit across Shanghai.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions, transmitted and widely propagated layer by layer by the municipal Revolutionary Committee and various revolutionary mass organizations, are gradually becoming known to every household and deeply ingrained in people's hearts, serving as a powerful driving force for the current struggle and all work. On October 16, the municipal Revolutionary Committee held a citywide large-scale report meeting. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, in light of the actual situation of Shanghai's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the meeting, providing great education and inspiration to the revolutionary cadres and masses of Shanghai.

Currently, the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of all sectors and industries in Shanghai are, with the greatest enthusiasm and the most resolute actions, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all aspects of their work. All districts, systems, and departments in the city are, using "criticize revisionism and repudiate selfishness" as the key link, closely combining with the actual struggle at present, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. At present, from urban areas to suburban areas, from factories to rural people's communes, from schools to neighborhoods, from leading organs to grassroots units, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are universally set up throughout Shanghai. All relevant units, when setting up study classes, strictly adhere to the principle of the masses educating themselves and liberating themselves, mobilizing the students to study the "Old Five Articles" ("On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Oppose Liberalism," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"), fiercely criticize selfishness, vigorously criticize revisionism, firmly establish the worldview of the proletariat, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Some units whose two revolutionary mass organizations have not yet united have, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and discussing, quickly achieved revolutionary unity under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Some organizations that have achieved revolutionary unity in terms of organization but whose ideological knots have not been completely untied have, through study and discussion, untied the knots and truly united politically and ideologically. The revolutionary big criticism in many units has also been further developed and closely combined with the rectification in their own units.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue have greatly inspired Shanghai's revolutionary cadres and revolutionary cadres, significantly promoting the progress of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Some units whose revolutionary cadres have done relatively well in liberating and using cadres have, through study and discussion, further strictly demanded of themselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and strived to do better in cadre work. The revolutionary cadres of units like the Heat Engineering Instrument Factory, which have done relatively well in cadre work, are determined to further help revolutionary cadres boldly grasp their work, truly stand shoulder to shoulder with them, and work together to carry out revolutionary criticism and rectification in their own units, and do a good job in production and work. Some cadres who originally had more concerns and hesitated have, during this study and discussion, deeply felt the meticulous care and love of the great leader Chairman Mao for revolutionary cadres. They bravely stand out to express their thoughts, criticize selfishness, and have heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary cadres, standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with actual actions. Many factories, stores, schools, offices, hospitals, and research institutes, especially those units that have established revolutionary committees, have, through the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions by old and new cadres together, further enhanced their unity, creating a lively scene of "old leading the new" and "new promoting the old."

The broad soldiers and officers of the land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai, who have established great merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, immediately, with the most enthusiastic political enthusiasm, the fastest actions, and the greatest revolutionary spirit, earnestly studied and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions upon hearing them. In recent days, from the leading organs of the three services stationed in Shanghai to the grassroots units, a hot wave of studying, lecturing, and reciting Chairman Mao's latest instructions has surged. All soldiers and officers are studying and discussing word by word and sentence by sentence, deeply understanding, and imprinting Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their minds, dissolving them in their blood, and implementing them in their actions. Many units are studying while formulating specific measures and immediately implementing them. The broad soldiers and officers have resolutely declared: They will definitely use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a driving force to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the army to a new level, create a new situation in the thought revolutionization of the army, and make new contributions in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work.

    上海市革命委员会发出通知并举行大型报告会。张春桥同志在会上传达了毛主席的最新指示，给全市军民以巨大的教育和鼓舞
    新华社上海二十二日电　上海广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和驻沪陆海空三军指战员，认真学习、坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席在视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列极为重要的指示。目前，一个学习毛主席最新指示的最广泛的群众运动，正在全市范围内轰轰烈烈地展开。上海市各条战线、各行各业都以“斗私，批修”为纲，大抓毛主席著作的学习，大办毛泽东思想学习班，进一步认清当前的大好形势，巩固和发展革命的大联合，革命的三结合，进一步搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    上海市革命委员会对毛主席的最新指示进行了认真的学习和讨论，并于十月三日发出了关于坚决贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的通知，要求全市立即掀起一个大规模的学习运动，让毛主席的最新指示，在全上海开花结果。
    毛主席的最新指示，经过市革命委员会和各革命群众组织的层层传达，广泛宣传，正在逐步做到家喻户晓，深入人心，成为推动当前斗争和各项工作的巨大动力。十月十六日，市革命委员会专门举行了全市性的大型报告会。张春桥同志在会上结合上海无产阶级文化大革命的实际情况，传达了毛主席的最新指示，给了全市无产阶级革命派和革命群众以巨大的教育和鼓舞。
    现在，上海市各条战线、各行各业的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，正在以最大的热情和最坚决的行动，把毛主席的最新指示落实到各方面的工作中去。全市各区县、各系统、各部门，纷纷以“斗私，批修”为纲，紧密结合当前的斗争实际，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。目前，上海市从市区到郊区，从工厂到农村人民公社，从学校到里弄，从领导机关到基层单位，普遍地办了毛泽东思想学习班。各有关单位在举办学习班的时候，都认真执行群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的原则，发动学员大学“老五篇”（《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》《纪念白求恩》《为人民服务》《愚公移山》），狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，大立无产阶级世界观，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。有些单位尚未联合起来的两派革命群众组织，在学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，经过讨论，迅速地在毛泽东思想的旗帜下实现了革命的大联合。一些原来在组织上实现了革命大联合，但思想上的疙瘩并未完全解开的组织，经过学习讨论，也解开了疙瘩，真正从政治上、思想上联合起来。不少单位的革命大批判，也有了进一步的开展，并且跟本单位的斗批改日益紧密地结合起来。
    毛主席在干部问题上所作的最新指示，给上海的无产阶级革命派和革命干部，以极大的鼓舞，大大地促进了革命三结合的进展。原来在解放干部、使用干部上工作做得比较好的一些单位的无产阶级革命派，经过学习讨论，更进一步以毛主席的最新指示严格要求自己，努力把干部工作做得更好。干部工作做得比较好的热工仪表厂等单位的无产阶级革命派决心进一步帮助革命干部大胆抓好工作，真正同他们携手并肩，共同努力，搞好革命大批判和本单位斗批改，搞好生产和工作。有些干部原来顾虑较多，缩手缩脚，这次学习讨论中，深切感到伟大领袖毛主席对革命干部的无微不至的关怀和爱护。他们勇敢地站出来亮思想，斗“私”字，同无产阶级革命派谈心交心，用实际行动站到毛主席革命路线一边来。许多工厂、商店、学校、机关、医院、研究所，特别是那些已经建立了革命委员会的单位，通过新老干部一起学习毛主席的最新指示，都进一步增强了团结，出现了“老带新”、“新促老”的生动局面。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了巨大功勋的驻沪陆海空三军广大指战员，听到伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示后，立即以最饱满的政治热情，最迅速的行动，最大的革命干劲，认真学习，坚决贯彻执行。连日来，从驻沪三军领导机关到基层连队，掀起了一个热气腾腾的大学习、大讲用、大背诵毛主席最新指示的热潮。全体指战员，逐字逐句地反复学习，反复讨论，深刻领会，把毛主席的最新指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。许多单位边学习，边制定了具体措施，立刻贯彻执行。广大指战员坚决表示：一定要以毛主席的最新指示为动力，把部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新水平，使部队思想革命化出现一个新局面，在“三支”“两军”工作中作出新的贡献。
