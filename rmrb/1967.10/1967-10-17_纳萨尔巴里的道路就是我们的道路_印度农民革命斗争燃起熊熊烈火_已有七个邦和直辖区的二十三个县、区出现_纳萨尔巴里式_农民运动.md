The Path of Nasalbari is Our Path
Indian Peasant Revolutionary Struggle Ignites Blazing Fire
"Nasalbari-style" peasant movements have emerged in 23 counties and districts across seven states and union territories

New Delhi, October 16 (Xinhua) — The armed revolutionary struggle of the peasants in Nasalbari, which erupted in March this year, has shaken the Indian subcontinent. Despite the Indian reactionary government dispatching large numbers of military and police forces to brutally suppress the peasants of Nasalbari, it cannot extinguish the revolutionary flames in this region, let alone stop the spread of this struggle across the country. Peasants in many parts of India are widely carrying out struggles under the slogan "The Path of Nasalbari is Our Path."

According to incomplete statistics, from March of this year to the present, "Nasalbari-style" peasant movements have emerged in 23 counties and districts across seven states and union territories.

Peasants in these regions have violently seized and distributed landlords' land, reclaimed wasteland seized by the reactionary government, and in some cases, planted red flags on this land. They have violently resisted landlords' evictions and dismissals, driven out landlords, and attacked reactionary government officials and police.

In West Bengal, from the northern districts of Darjeeling and Cooch Behar to the southern Sundarbans region and the eastern districts of Hooghly and Twenty-four Parganas, peasants in 12 regions have launched land struggles. A minister in West Bengal exclaimed: Landless and poor peasants may create dozens of Nasalbaris within the state.

According to Indian newspapers, in the mountainous areas of Darjeeling district, "Nasalbari-style movements are quietly emerging." The *Ganesh Market Report* recently reported: "In various parts of Darjeeling district, peasants are organizing to seize land in a manner similar to the movement initiated in Nasalbari."

According to the *Ganesh Market Report* last month, peasants in the areas surrounding Nadia district in West Bengal, such as Santipur, Salbanadapur, Nabadeep, Ranaghat, and Chakdaha, have launched Nasalbari-style movements. According to reports, in the regions of Salbanadapur and Santipur, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India leads peasants in armed resistance, training youth for organized armed resistance, and calling on peasants to oppose the government's procurement policies and launch grain seizures. Unarmed police dare not enter these regions. The Indian government is in a state of panic, describing this as a "politically alarming situation" that could potentially become "Nasalbari-style disturbances."

In the districts of Nalgonda and Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh, Nainital and Maihar in Uttar Pradesh, Dindigul in Madras, the suburbs of Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, and Karatur, the rural areas of Purnea, Dhanbad, and Bihar in Bagalpur, peasant land struggles have occurred.

In Andhra Pradesh, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India led peasants in the rural areas of Nalgonda district, where the torch of armed struggle was first raised in 1946, to drive out landlords, cut off landlords' irrigation systems, and attack Congress Party members.

In the Katihar district of Purnea in Bihar, over a thousand peasants shouted slogans such as "Turn Purnea into Nasalbari!" and "The harvest belongs to the tillers!" bravely harvesting five hundred acres of landlord's corn. They fought back against resisting landlords with bricks, sticks, and other weapons. The reactionary government dispatched police to suppress the situation, but they were unable to control it.

In the Wayalar region of Chettayat Taluk in Kerala, peasants seized 800 acres of government-owned flooded land in late September.

From the beginning of the armed struggle of the peasants in Nasalbari to the present, the development of the peasant movement in India over the past half year indicates that the peasant movement in India has gradually developed into an urgent political issue that shakes the reactionary regime of India. No matter what counter-revolutionary methods the Indian reactionaries adopt against the peasants' struggle, the flames of peasant revolution will only burn more fiercely.

### “纳萨尔巴里的道路就是我们的道路”　印度农民革命斗争燃起熊熊烈火　已有七个邦和直辖区的二十三个县、区出现“纳萨尔巴里式”农民运动

　　“纳萨尔巴里的道路就是我们的道路”
　　印度农民革命斗争燃起熊熊烈火
　　已有七个邦和直辖区的二十三个县、区出现“纳萨尔巴里式”农民运动
    新华社十六日讯  新德里消息：今年三月爆发的纳萨尔巴里农民革命武装斗争的一声春雷，震动了印度大地。尽管印度反动政府出动大批军警对纳萨尔巴里农民进行残酷镇压，但是它无法扑灭这个地区农民的革命火焰，更无法阻挡这一斗争传遍全国的影响。印度不少地方的农民，正在“纳萨尔巴里的道路就是我们的道路”的口号下广泛地开展斗争。
    据不完全统计，从今年三月到现在，已有七个邦和中央直辖区的二十三个县、区内出现了“纳萨尔巴里式”的农民运动。
    这些地区的农民暴力夺取和分配地主的土地，自行开垦反动政府霸占的荒地，有的并在这些地上插上红旗。他们用暴力反抗地主的夺佃、解雇，驱逐地主，袭击反动政府官员和警察。
    在西孟加拉邦，从北部的大吉岭县、库奇比哈尔县到南部的松达班斯地区以及东部的胡格里、二十四帕加纳斯，已有十二个地区的农民开展土地斗争。西孟加拉邦的部长惊呼：无地少地农民可能在邦内制造几十个纳萨尔巴里。
    据印度报纸透露，在大吉岭县的一些山区，“正在悄悄地出现纳萨尔巴里式运动”。《甘露市场报》不久前报道说：“大吉岭县各地（农民）正有组织地企图强占土地，其方式同纳萨尔巴里发动的运动的形式相仿。”
    据《甘露市场报》上月报道，在西孟加拉邦纳迪阿县周围的桑提普尔、萨尔巴纳达普尔、纳巴德维普、腊纳加特、查克达等地的农民，开展了纳萨尔巴里式的运动。据报道，在萨尔巴纳达普尔和桑提普尔等地区印共革命派领导农民进行武装割据，训练青年进行有组织的武装抵抗，号召农民反对政府的收购政策，开展抢米运动。非武装的警察已不敢前往这些地区。印度政府惊慌失措，把这称为“有可能成为纳萨尔巴里式骚乱”的“令人恐慌”的政治事态。
    在安得拉邦的拿尔岗达县、斯里卡库兰县，北方邦的奈尼塔尔县、迈哈地区，马德拉斯邦的丹卓尔县，喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅的郊区、卡拉图尔，比哈尔邦的普尔尼亚县、丹巴德县、巴加尔浦县的农村地区，都发生了农民土地斗争。
    在安得拉邦，印共革命派今年上半年在一九四六年首先举起特仑甘纳武装斗争火炬的拿尔岗达县的农村地区领导农民驱逐地主，切断地主的灌溉系统，袭击国大党分子。
    在比哈尔邦普尔尼亚县的卡提哈尔，九月上旬有一千多农民高呼“把普尔尼亚变成纳萨尔巴里！”“收成归于耕种者！”的口号，勇敢地收割了五百英亩地主土地上的玉米。他们用砖石、棍棒和其他武器还击敢于顽抗的地主。反动政府出动警察赶去镇压，但是无法控制局势。
    在喀拉拉邦谢塔赖塔卢克的瓦亚拉尔地区，农民九月下旬夺占了属于政府的八百英亩水淹地。
    从纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争开始到现在，半年多来印度农民运动的发展情况表明，印度农民运动已经逐渐发展成为震撼印度反动政权的紧急政治问题。不管印度反动派对农民的斗争采取什么样的反革命手法，农民革命的火焰必将越烧越旺。
