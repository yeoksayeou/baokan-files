The Representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office Severely Condemns the Anti-China Evil Activities of Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun"
Order Announced to Revoke the Credentials of the Newspaper's Correspondent in Beijing

New China News Agency, October 12th – The representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office in China met with the representative of the Takasugi Office in Beijing on October 12th. The representative severely condemned the anti-China activities of the leadership of Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun," who, at the instigation of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, collaborated with the "Buddhist Missionary Association of Japan" to bring the head of the Tibetan rebels, the Dalai Lama, from India to Japan on September 25, 1967, to engage in anti-China activities. The representative also announced, on orders, the revocation of the credentials of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" correspondent in Beijing effective today.

The representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office pointed out: On September 26th, the Dalai Lama presided over the opening ceremony of the so-called "Tibetan Treasure Exhibition" sponsored by the "Yomiuri Shimbun" in Tokyo. Maps hung at the event and pamphlets sold there all depicted Tibet as another "country," and referred to the "Tibetan people" alongside Japanese and Indian citizens as "citizens of three countries." This is a blatant attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs, to split China's sacred territory; it is a blatant political provocation against China. Participants in this conspiracy included the president of the "Yomiuri Shimbun," Masataro Shoriki, officials from the U.S. Embassy in Japan, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Indian chargé d'affaires, among others.

According to reports, after his activities in Tokyo, the Dalai Lama also went to Kyoto and other places to engage in conspiracy activities.

The representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office pointed out: On September 28th, Wu Shudong, the representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Tokyo, was authorized to issue a serious warning to the "Yomiuri Shimbun" regarding the conspiracy to bring the rebel leader Dalai Lama to Japan. Ancient officials, Guijian Xishizhen and Dakuo Renqing, were also present. Wu Shudong sternly pointed out in the warning that the "Yomiuri Shimbun" orchestrating the Dalai Lama's visit to Japan was an extremely malicious anti-China act, a blatant provocation against China. Wu Shudong solemnly warned the "Yomiuri Shimbun" that it must immediately take effective measures to stop and cancel this anti-China activity, otherwise, the serious consequences that arise from this must be borne by the "Yomiuri Shimbun." However, on September 30th, the "Yomiuri Shimbun" gave a so-called "response" through Guijian Xishizhen to the representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Tokyo, denying that the Dalai Lama's visit to Japan had anything to do with the "Yomiuri Shimbun"; and arguing that the so-called "Tibetan Treasure Exhibition" had no political intentions. It is clear that the "Yomiuri Shimbun" not only took no measures but also persisted in its conspiracy activities, rejecting our warning and continuing its plot. On October 6th, the "Yomiuri Shimbun" gave a second "response" through Guijian Xishizhen, attempting to brush off the matter after its main conspiracy activities had been implemented. This is something we absolutely cannot agree to.

The representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office pointed out: The fact that the leadership of the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" orchestrated the Dalai Lama's visit to Japan to engage in anti-China conspiracy activities is undeniable. Even Guijian Xishizhen admitted, in the presence of the representative of the "Yomiuri Shimbun," that this time the "Yomiuri Shimbun" "invited" the Dalai Lama to Japan was done by the newspaper's president, Masataro Shoriki. As for the "Yomiuri Shimbun" arguing that the exhibition had no political intentions, it is sheer nonsense. As mentioned above, the facts of the evil activities of interfering in China's internal affairs and splitting China's sacred territory cannot be denied. This is another piece of evidence of the Japanese reactionary government's pursuit of the U.S. empire, collusion with the Indian reactionary government, and intensification of anti-China policies. It is a blatant exposure of the ugly face of the leadership of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" as a tool of the Sato reactionary government's anti-China policies.

The representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office pointed out: This conspiracy activity, which took place right after Sato's "visit" to Taiwan and his anti-China collusion in Southeast Asia and other regions, and at the time when the U.S. puppet United Nations General Assembly was in session, further exposes its sinister political purposes. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this.

　　我廖承志办事处代表严厉谴责日本“读卖新闻社”的反华罪恶活动
　　奉命宣布取消该社派驻北京记者资格
    新华社十二日讯　中国廖承志办事处代表十二日约见日本高碕办事处驻北京代表，严厉谴责日本“读卖新闻社”负责人在反华浪潮中，在美日反动派的唆使下，于一九六七年九月二十五日，伙同日本“佛教传道协会”将我国西藏叛匪头目达赖由印度弄到日本，进行反华的罪恶活动；并奉命宣布：自今日起，取消日本“读卖新闻社”派驻北京记者的资格。
    廖办代表指出：九月二十六日，达赖在东京主持了由“读卖新闻社”主办的所谓“西藏秘宝展览会”的开幕式。会上悬挂的地图和出售的小册子里，都把西藏划为另外一个“国家”，把“西藏群众”和日本、印度国民并称为“三国国民”。这是妄图粗暴干涉中国内政，分裂中国神圣领土；公然进行反华的政治挑衅。参与这次阴谋活动的，除“读卖新闻社”社长正力松太郎外，还有美国驻日大使馆官员、日本外务省官员和印度驻日代办等。
    据报道，达赖在东京活动之后，还到京都等地进行了阴谋活动。
    廖办代表指出：九月二十八日，我驻东京廖办代表吴曙东曾受权就“读卖新闻社”包揽叛匪达赖去日阴谋活动一事，向“读卖新闻社”提出严重警告。高碕办事处负责人古井喜实、大久保任晴也在座。吴曙东在警告中严正指出：“读卖新闻社”包揽达赖到日本“访问”，是极端恶劣的反华行为，是对中国的明目张胆的挑衅。吴曙东郑重警告“读卖新闻社”必须立即采取有效措施，停止和取消这一反华活动，否则，由此而引起的严重后果，必须由“读卖新闻社”承担。但是，九月三十日“读卖新闻社”在通过古井喜实向中国驻东京廖办代表作出的所谓“回答”中，竟抵赖说，达赖访问日本与“读卖新闻社”无关；又狡辩说，所谓“西藏秘宝展览会”完全没有政治意图。可见“读卖新闻社”非但没有采取任何措施，反而一意孤行，拒绝了我方的警告，继续其阴谋活动。十月六日，“读卖新闻社”又通过古井喜实作了第二次“回答”，在其阴谋活动的主要部分已经付诸实施之后，竟然企图不了了之。这是我们绝对不能同意的。
    廖办代表指出：日本“读卖新闻社”负责人包揽达赖访日，搞反华阴谋活动，事实俱在，不容抵赖。连古井喜实在会见我驻东京廖办代表时，也当着“读卖新闻社”代表的面说，这次“读卖新闻社”“请”达赖到日本，是该社的社长正力松太郎干的。至于“读卖新闻社”狡辩说，展览会完全没有政治意图，也是一派胡言。如上所述，妄图干涉中国内政，分裂中国神圣领土的罪恶活动事实是赖不掉的。这是日本反动政府追随美帝，勾结印度反动派，加紧推行反华政策的又一罪证，是“读卖新闻社”负责人秉承佐藤反动政府的意旨，充当其反华工具的丑恶嘴脸的大暴露。
    廖办代表指出：这次阴谋活动，选择在佐藤刚刚“访问”台湾之后，和佐藤到东南亚一些国家和地区进行反华串连以及美国的御用工具联合国大会正在开会时进行，就更加暴露了它的阴险的政治目的。中国人民对此绝对不能容忍。
