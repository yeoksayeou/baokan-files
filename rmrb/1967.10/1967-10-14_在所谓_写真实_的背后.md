Title: Behind the So-Called "Write the Truth"

The theory of "writing the truth" is the most outdated commodity of bourgeois literature. However, China's Khrushchev, like the Machists mocked by Lenin, wears the old hat of "writing the truth" discarded by the bourgeoisie, parading around and delighting in it.

He shouts: "Works should be 'objective and true,' 'as long as this life is recorded truthfully,' 'do not add oil and vinegar, do not wear colored glasses,' do not 'emphasize stance'." What a face, as if everyone else is "hypocritical," and only he has found the way to "write the truth"!

What is this "do not add oil and vinegar"? Any literary work expresses the author's political tendencies and is permeated with the author's love and hatred. Where is there any purely objective work? China's Khrushchev clearly wants to speak for the bourgeoisie, yet he hesitates to talk about "truth." The "truth" he talks about is the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie.

What is this "do not wear colored glasses"? In a society where classes and class struggle exist, it is either observing and reflecting the world with Mao Zedong Thought or with bourgeois ideology. Is there anyone in the world who is above class? China's Khrushchev clearly sits on the same bench with the bourgeoisie, yet he deceives himself and others by saying not to "emphasize stance." The "objectivity" he talks about is a distortion of reality.

Only by standing on the proletarian stance and mastering Mao Zedong Thought can one grasp the essence and mainstream of life, reflecting the objective truth that socialism will inevitably triumph and capitalism will inevitably perish. However, China's Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois stance determines that he fears the inevitable laws of social development, distorts, and covers up the objective truth. The "write the truth" he advocates is nothing but a deceptive facade!

We must ask China's Khrushchev:

You repeatedly incite literary and artistic workers to "thoroughly" "expose" the "dark side" of the Three Red Banners, to reflect everything that the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists "dare not say" and "cannot say," is this "objective and true"?

You repeatedly incite literary and artistic workers not to "only say workers are good and capitalists are bad," shouting to give the bourgeoisie a "position," to beautify the bourgeoisie, and to advocate "exploitation is meritorious," is this also "objective and true"?

You repeatedly advocate Western capitalist "civilization," attacking our newspapers for "only publishing criticism of the United States and praising ourselves," which "will create a false impression," wanting us to enthusiastically praise American imperialism and Western capitalist "civilization," is this also "objective and true"?

It turns out that China's Khrushchev's "write the truth" is to make revolutionary literary and artistic workers abandon the proletarian stance, deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought, use the reactionary views of the bourgeoisie and revisionism to understand the world and reflect life, sing the praises of the "brightness" of the capitalist system, "expose" the "darkness" of the socialist system, praise the "progress" of the bourgeoisie, and defame the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers as "backward," completely reversing the bright and dark sides of the world!

It turns out that China's Khrushchev's "write the truth" is to make revolutionary literary and artistic workers betray the proletariat, like rightists, to expose the "darkness" of the socialist system, to call for the "early spring" of capitalist restoration, to write anti-party poisonous weeds like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," to incite all ghosts and snakes to rebel, and to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country!

This is the evil intention hidden behind China's Khrushchev's "write the truth"!

Revolutionary literary and artistic workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have firm stances and clear banners, believing only in the truth of Mao Zedong Thought, not in the bourgeoisie's "write the truth." Socialism is like a red sun rising, and capitalism is "setting sun, gasping for breath." This is the objective truth of our era, and this is the objective truth that we revolutionary literary and artistic workers must write about!

　　在所谓“写真实”的背后
　　文红兵
    “写真实”论，是资产阶级文艺最陈腐的货色。中国赫鲁晓夫却象列宁所嘲笑过的马赫主义者那样，戴上“写真实”这顶资产阶级用破了的旧帽子，招摇过市，而喜不自胜。
    他叫嚷：作品要“客观、真实”，“只要把这种生活如实地记载下来”，“不要添油加醋，不要带有色眼镜”，不要“只强调立场”。好一副别个无不“虚伪”，唯独自己得了“写真实”之道的脸孔！
    什么“不要添油加醋”？任何文艺作品，都表现着作者的政治倾向性，都渗透着作者的爱和憎。哪里有什么纯客观的作品呢？中国赫鲁晓夫明明是要替资产阶级说话，却偏要忸忸怩怩地谈什么“真实”。他所说的“真实”，就是资产阶级的虚伪。
    什么“不要带有色眼镜”？在存在着阶级和阶级斗争的社会里，不是用毛泽东思想去观察、反映世界，就是用资产阶级思想去观察、反映世界，难道世界上有什么超阶级的人吗？中国赫鲁晓夫明明是和资产阶级同坐一条板凳，却自欺欺人地说什么不要“强调立场”。他所说的“客观”，就是对现实的歪曲。
    只有站在无产阶级的立场，掌握毛泽东思想，才能抓住生活的本质和主流，反映出社会主义必然胜利、资本主义必然灭亡的客观真实。而中国赫鲁晓夫的反动资产阶级立场，决定了他害怕社会发展的必然规律，歪曲和掩盖客观真实。他所标榜的“写真实”，不过是骗人的幌子罢了！
    我们要问中国赫鲁晓夫：
    你一再煽动文艺工作者去“彻底”“揭露”三面红旗的“阴暗面”，把地、富、反、坏、右“不敢说的，不能说的”统统反映出来，难道这是“客观、真实”吗？
    你一再煽动文艺工作者不能“只说工人好，说资本家不好”，叫嚣要给资产阶级“地位”，要美化资产阶级，宣扬“剥削有功”，难道这也是“客观、真实”吗？
    你一再鼓吹西方资本主义“文明”，攻击我们的报刊“只登骂美国的，说我们好的”，“就会造成假象”，要我们狂热吹捧美帝和西方资本主义“文明”，难道这也是“客观、真实”吗？
    原来，中国赫鲁晓夫的“写真实”，就是要革命文艺工作者放弃无产阶级立场，背离毛泽东思想的轨道，用资产阶级和修正主义的反动观点去认识世界、反映生活，歌颂资本主义制度的“光明”，“暴露”社会主义制度的“黑暗”，赞美资产阶级的“进步”，污蔑工农兵英雄人物的“落后”，把世界的光明面和黑暗面完全颠倒过来！
    原来，中国赫鲁晓夫的“写真实”，就是要革命文艺工作者背叛无产阶级，象右派分子那样，暴露社会主义制度的“黑暗”，呼唤资本主义复辟的“早春天气”，写《海瑞罢官》那样的反党毒草，煽动一切牛鬼蛇神起来翻天，颠覆我国无产阶级专政！
    这就是中国赫鲁晓夫在“写真实”的背后所包藏的祸心！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命文艺工作者，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，只相信毛泽东思想的真理，不相信资产阶级的“写真实”。社会主义如一轮红日冉冉上升，资本主义“日薄西山，气息奄奄”，这才是我们时代的客观真实，这才是我们革命文艺工作者必须大写特写的客观真实！
