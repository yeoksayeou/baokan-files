The core of "resume classes, carry out the revolution" is carrying out the revolution.

"Resume classes, carry out the revolution" is a great call made by our beloved leader Chairman Mao in the face of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the main direction of the current revolutionary struggle in schools.

"Resume classes, carry out the revolution" requires us to let politics lead business and let revolution lead the resumption of classes. Resuming classes is not the same as restoring the old ways. "Resume classes, carry out the revolution" is not about resuming classes and abandoning the revolution. The core of "resume classes, carry out the revolution" is carrying out the revolution. Currently, the main focus of "resume classes, carry out the revolution" is to take "criticize revisionism and repudiate the self" as the key, to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought actively, to criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize the revisionist educational line, to criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and especially to focus on the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the school, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is the main course. With this premise, we can appropriately resume some business and cultural classes according to different situations. If we think that now that school has started, we can ignore the great criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the school, and dive headfirst into business and cultural classes, reading books mechanically, that would easily lead to the resumption of old rules and the restoration of the old educational order, and even cause the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the past year to be aborted. This is something we must be vigilant against.

    复课闹革命的中心是闹革命
    复课闹革命，是在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席向我们发出的伟大号召，是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要组成部分，是学校当前革命斗争的大方向。
    复课闹革命要求我们用政治统帅业务，用革命统帅复课。复课不是复旧，复课闹革命不是复课丢革命。复课闹革命的中心是闹革命。当前复课闹革命，主要是以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛泽东思想，批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，批判修正主义教育路线，批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”，特别要狠抓本校内的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。这是主课。有了这个前提，可以根据不同情况，适当地复一些业务课和文化课。如果以为现在开学了，就置革命大批判和本校斗批改而不顾，一头栽进业务课、文化课中，死读书，读死书，那就容易承袭旧规，恢复旧的教育秩序，甚至导致一年来无产阶级文化大革命的夭折。这是需要我们警惕的。
