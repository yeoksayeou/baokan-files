The Central Committee's notice on implementing revolutionary great unity by system has reached Wuhan City. The revolutionary masses of our "New First Metallurgical Construction Company" are spreading the news and joyfully cheering. The broad masses of the proletarian revolutionaries enthusiastically say: "Chairman Mao is heart to heart with us rebels. He understands the demands of the masses best. This notice speaks the words in our hearts." The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses are beating drums and gongs, marching in the streets, and shouting a thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live!"

Our First Metallurgical Construction Company Proletarian Revolutionary Representative Congress Preparatory Committee (New First) was born in the life-and-death struggle against the party's biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and their agents in the Wuhan region. Last October, under Chairman Mao's call to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, our company successively established dozens of large and small revolutionary mass organizations. In early February, we seized power from the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the company, thus forming the embryonic form of revolutionary great unity. Soon, we learned from the experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill in implementing revolutionary great unity by administrative departments, fought hard against selfishness, discarded factionalism, leveled the "mountains," and under the principle of revolution, voluntarily linked up to form the New First Proletarian Revolutionary Representative Congress Preparatory Committee. After our revolutionary workers united, our strength was concentrated, our goals were unified, and we always directed our struggle at China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan. We persistently carried out revolutionary great criticism and struggle within the unit, greatly mobilizing the initiative of the broad revolutionary masses, and batch after batch of workers were fully mobilized to become a strong force for the proletarian revolutionaries of "New First." Together with the proletarian revolutionaries of Wuhan City, we have always fought hard on the front line of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Under the inspiration of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, our industrial workers' army has grown from small to large, from weak to strong. Every step forward fully demonstrates the correctness of implementing revolutionary great unity by system. Every achievement we have made is a great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao recently taught us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, like the brilliant sunlight shining in our hearts. Today, Chairman Mao further calls on us to quickly implement revolutionary great unity by system and by industry. This is a major measure to carry out "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." We workers will carry it out a thousand times. We must fight hard against the "self" in our minds, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," persist in implementing revolutionary great unity by system and by industry, so as to deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation within the unit.

　　毛主席的话，我们工人一千个照办
　　武汉新一冶无产阶级革命派代表大会筹委会
    党中央关于按照系统实行革命大联合的通知传到了武汉市，我们“新一冶”的革命群众奔走相告，尽情地欢呼。广大无产阶级革命派万分激动地说：“毛主席他老人家和我们造反派心连心，他老人家最了解群众的要求，这个通知说出了我们的心里话。”无产阶级革命派和革命群众，敲锣打鼓，上街游行，千万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    我们第一冶金建设公司无产阶级革命派代表大会筹委会（新一冶），是在同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在武汉地区代理人的生死搏斗中产生的。去年十月，在毛主席发出彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的号召下，我公司先后成立了几十个大大小小的革命群众组织。二月初，我们夺了公司里走资本主义道路当权派的权，这时便形成了革命大联合的雏形。不久，我们学习贵阳棉纺厂按行政部门实行革命大联合的经验，狠斗“私”字，丢掉派性，铲平“山头”，在革命的原则下，自动串联组成新一冶无产阶级革命派代表大会筹委会。我们革命职工联合起来以后，力量集中，目标一致，始终把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉代理人，坚持在本单位开展革命大批判、大斗争，极大地发挥了广大革命群众的斗争积极性，一批又一批工人充分地发动起来，成为“新一冶”无产阶级革命派的坚强力量。我们和武汉市的无产阶级革命派一道，始终艰苦战斗在保卫毛主席的革命路线的最前线。
    我们这支产业工人大军，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗鼓舞下，由小到大，由弱到强，每前进一步，都充分体现了按系统实现革命大联合的正确性。我们所取得的每一个成绩，都是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。毛主席最近教导我们，要斗私，批修，象灿烂的阳光照得我们心里亮堂堂。今天，毛主席又进一步号召我们迅速按系统、按行业实行革命大联合，这是搞好“斗私，批修”的一项重大措施，我们工人一千个照办。我们一定要狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，坚持按系统、按行业实现革命大联合，以便深入搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。
