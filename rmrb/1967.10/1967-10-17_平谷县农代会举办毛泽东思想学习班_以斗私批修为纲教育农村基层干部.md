Pinggu County Agricultural Representatives Congress Holds Mao Zedong Thought Study Class
	With "Fighting Selfishness and Criticizing Revisionism" as the Guideline to Educate Rural Grassroots Cadres

	Xinhua News Agency, October 16th

	The Agricultural Representatives Congress of Pinggu County, the first county in the Beijing suburbs to establish a revolutionary committee, held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline to educate rural grassroots cadres.

	The study class began on October 6th. Over 200 participants, including members of the Agricultural Representatives Congress from various people's communes and production brigades, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, and instructors of Mao Zedong's works, are grassroots cadres. Among them, some have made various mistakes. In the early stages of the movement, they were criticized and struggled against by the masses, leading to thoughts of not wanting to be cadres anymore. In the study class, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," Mao Zedong's brilliant works, Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and related editorials. They took Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, and the old fool as examples, conducted self-examinations, and engaged in self-education through three remembrances and three comparisons: remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; remembering the three crimes of the capitalist roaders in power and comparing it with the great power of Mao Zedong Thought; remembering the party's cultivation of oneself and comparing it with one's contributions to the revolution.

	In the study class, many cadres bravely exposed their selfish thoughts and asked for help in criticizing them, achieving significant progress. They said that following Chairman Mao in revolution requires continuously fighting against the "self" in one's mind. Revolution with "self" will not be complete and thorough. Only by eliminating "self" can one deeply criticize and expose revisionism, overthrow and denounce the handful of capitalist roaders within the party; only by eliminating "self" can one establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The former party branch secretary of Zhoucun Production Brigade, Daxing Commune, Zhao Guang, was struck down by the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, developing negative thoughts and deciding never to be a cadre again. In the study class, he repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, gaining clarity and exposing all his erroneous thoughts. He decided to return to the brigade and expose all his selfish thoughts, asking the poor and lower-middle peasants for help in criticizing them, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, turn the production brigade into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

	The grassroots cadres participating in the study class, through their studies, further recognized the current excellent situation. They listed dozens of good points for the more than one-year-long Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply feeling that the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are indeed the greatest. They said that the reason they could not see the situation clearly in the past was mainly because they did not have a broad vision for the country and the world, only spinning in their own small circles. In a word, their minds lacked a "public" character and had too much "self."

	The comrades participating in this study class unanimously agreed that the Mao Zedong Thought study class is a powerful ideological stronghold for "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and a good way to popularize Mao Zedong Thought; by persistently running the Mao Zedong Thought study class well, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can be pushed to a new stage. They expressed that they would definitely act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, firmly grasp the grand direction of the revolutionary struggle, further carry out the great criticism, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of their own units, vigorously promote revolution, vigorously promote production, strive to be models of supporting the army and loving the people, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　平谷县农代会举办毛泽东思想学习班
    以斗私批修为纲教育农村基层干部
    新华社十六日讯　北京郊区第一个成立革命委员会的平谷县的农代会，以“斗私，批修”为纲，举办毛泽东思想学习班，教育农村基层干部。
    学习班在十月六日开学。参加学习的二百多名学员，都是来自各人民公社、生产大队的农代会成员、革命群众组织负责人、革命干部和学习毛主席著作辅导员等基层干部。他们中间，有一部分人犯有这样那样的错误，运动初期受到了群众的批判和斗争，产生了不愿意当干部的思想。他们在学习班学习毛主席“斗私，批修”的最新指示和毛主席的光辉著作，林彪副主席在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上的重要讲话以及有关社论，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，对照检查自己。同时，通过三忆三比，即忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆走资本主义道路当权派的三反罪行，比毛泽东思想的巨大威力；忆党对自己的培养，比自己对革命的贡献，来进行自我教育。
    在学习班里，不少干部勇敢地亮出自己灵魂深处的私心杂念，请大家帮助批判，得到了很大的提高。他们说，跟着毛主席干革命，必须不断地和自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，带着“私”字干革命是不会完全、彻底的。只有斗掉“私”字，才能批深批透修正主义，斗倒斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；只有斗掉“私”字，才能树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。大兴庄公社周村大队原党支部书记赵广，在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，受到资产阶级反动路线的打击，产生了消极思想，曾经下决心一辈子不当干部了。在学习班中，他反复学习“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示，心里亮堂了，把自己的错误思想全盘托出，决心回到队里把私心杂念都亮出来，请贫下中农帮助批判，和贫下中农一起把生产大队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    参加学习班的基层干部经过学习，进一步认清了当前的大好形势。他们给一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命摆出了几十条好处，深深体会到，无产阶级文化大革命所取得的成绩的确是最大最大最大。他们说，我们过去所以看不清形势，主要是没有胸怀祖国、放眼世界，只在自己的小圈子里打转。一句话，脑子里少了一个“公”字，多了一个“私”字。
    参加这次学习的同志一致认为，毛泽东思想学习班，是“斗私，批修”的强大思想阵地，是普及毛泽东思想的一个好办法；坚持办好毛泽东思想学习班，就能把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段。他们表示，一定要按照毛主席的最新指示办事，以“斗私，批修”为纲，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，进一步开展革命的大批判，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，争做拥军爱民的模范，加强无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
