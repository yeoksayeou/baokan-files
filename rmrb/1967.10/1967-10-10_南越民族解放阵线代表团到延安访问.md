The revolutionary masses of Yan'an, the revolutionary holy land, and the soldiers and officers of the Yan'an Military Sub-district of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly welcomed the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, led by the combat hero Nguyen Van Danh, who came to visit and tour today. Yan'an is the place where our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao worked and fought. Chairman Mao led the Chinese people here in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, ultimately achieving victory for the Chinese revolution. Today, the people and soldiers of Yan'an, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, feel particularly close and extremely excited about the arrival of the combat heroes from the front lines of the anti-American struggle in South Vietnam. People held up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, and sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," welcoming their glorious Vietnamese comrades on the streets and at the airport.

At 4 PM, when the special plane carrying the Vietnamese comrades from the south landed at Yan'an Airport, the welcoming crowds immediately erupted in shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Salute to the close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho!" When Nguyen Van Danh and other Vietnamese comrades from the south stepped off the plane to meet the welcoming crowds, people applauded enthusiastically and shouted battle slogans.

Tonight, the responsible officials of the Yan'an Military Sub-district held a banquet to warmly welcome the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.
