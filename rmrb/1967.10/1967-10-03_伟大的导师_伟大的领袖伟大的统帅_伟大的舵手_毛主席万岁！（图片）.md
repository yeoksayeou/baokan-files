Great Teacher, Great Leader, Great Commander, Great Helmsman - Long Live Chairman Mao!

Vietnamese cultural workers from the front lines of the struggle against American imperialism express their boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They joyfully sing the Chinese revolutionary song "The Boat Needs a Helmsman."

On October 1st, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, along with the head of the Albanian Party and Government delegation, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Comrade Muhammad Shehu, reviewed the parade on Tiananmen Gate.

Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun, shining wherever it goes. Parade participants dressed in various ethnic costumes, holding high Chairman Mao's works, sang and danced their way through Tiananmen Square, accepting the review of our great leader, Chairman Mao. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's latest directive to "criticize and repudiate revisionism" and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao and Premier Zhou Enlai reviewed the parade on Tiananmen Gate.

The revolutionary literary and artistic circles are advancing victoriously along the revolutionary literary and artistic line of Chairman Mao. The days when China's Khrushchev stubbornly upheld the rule of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties on the stage are gone forever. We workers, peasants, and soldiers not only want to be the masters of the political stage but also the masters of the literary and artistic stage.

    文艺界的无产阶级革命派沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利前进。中国赫鲁晓夫所顽固维护的帝王将相、才子佳人统治舞台的日子，一去不复返了。我们工农兵不仅要做政治舞台的主人，而且要做文艺舞台的主人。　本报记者　沈谷容摄
