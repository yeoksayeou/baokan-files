	Chinese Embassy in Burma Sends Note to Burmese Foreign Ministry
	Demanding Immediate Unconditional Release of All Innocent Detained Chinese Nationals

	Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: Rangoon News: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Foreign Ministry on the 12th, once again demanding that the Burmese government immediately release all innocent detained Chinese nationals.

	The note states that the Ne Win government in Burma, without any reason, has illegally arrested a large number of Chinese nationals in this anti-China, anti-Chinese movement. Despite the strong protests and repeated negotiations by the Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy, demanding that the Ne Win government immediately and unconditionally release all of them, the Ne Win government has ignored this legitimate demand. To this day, many Chinese nationals are still imprisoned in the Insein Prison and other prisons, suffering cruel persecution.

	The note states that among the innocent detained Chinese nationals, Chen Bo Fu, Huang Zhong Quan, and Yuan Ying Tang have suffered both mental and physical torture for over three months. The nearly 70-year-old Chen Bo Fu was beaten by Burmese soldiers, with his right ribcage broken and still not healed. His liver disease has worsened, and he has not been able to eat for a long time, with his health in a very bad condition and not receiving proper treatment. The over 50-year-old Huang Zhong Quan was also beaten by soldiers, with scars still visible on his waist and right chest from being hit with a rifle butt. His kidney disease, heart disease, and rheumatism have worsened, making it difficult for him to walk. The Burmese authorities do not provide proper medical treatment, and his health is in a very bad condition. Yuan Ying Tang was beaten multiple times during several interrogations, leaving him with injuries all over his body and severely damaging his health. The Ne Win government, fearing that the evidence of beating would be discovered, has washed the handkerchief used to wipe Yuan Ying Tang's blood multiple times, attempting to destroy the evidence. What is particularly intolerable is that the relevant departments of the Ne Win government dared to insult the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, during the interrogations, attempting to use despicable means to shake the determination of patriotic Chinese nationals to love their great leader and great motherland. This is absolutely unacceptable.

	The Chinese Embassy once again demands that the Burmese government immediately and unconditionally release all innocent detained Chinese nationals; immediately release Chen Bo Fu, Huang Zhong Quan, Yuan Ying Tang, and other detained Chinese nationals who are in poor health, have been tortured, and are weak and sick; and punish the criminals who persecuted and beat the detained Chinese nationals.

	The note states that if the Burmese government continues to act arbitrarily, it must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences that may arise.

### 我驻缅甸使馆照会缅外交部　必须立即无条件释放所有无辜被捕华侨

　　我驻缅甸使馆照会缅外交部
　　必须立即无条件释放所有无辜被捕华侨
    新华社十三日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十二日照会缅甸外交部，再次要求缅甸政府必须立即释放所有无辜被捕华侨。
    照会说，缅甸奈温政府在这次反华排华运动中毫无理由地非法逮捕了大批华侨，对他们恣意进行迫害。虽然中国政府和中国大使馆为此提出了强烈抗议，进行了多次交涉，要求缅甸奈温政府立即无条件地全部恢复他们的自由。但奈温政府对这一正当要求不予置理，至今很多华侨仍然被监禁在永盛监狱和其他监狱中，遭受残酷迫害。
    照会说，无辜被捕爱国华侨中的陈伯甫、黄忠泉、阮詠棠三人，在三个多月的监禁中受尽精神和肉体的折磨。年近七十的陈伯甫，遭到缅甸军人毒打，右胸肋骨被打弯，至今未愈，肝病也进一步恶化，长期吃不下饭，健康状况非常坏，得不到应有的治疗。五十多岁的黄忠泉也遭军人毒打，被军人用枪托打伤的腰部、右胸的伤疤仍然存在，肾脏病、心脏病、风湿性关节炎病情日益恶化，行走十分困难，缅甸当局不给应有的医疗，健康状况极坏。阮詠棠在几次审讯中，多次遭到毒打，遍体鳞伤，健康遭到极大损害。奈温政府做贼心虚，害怕打人的罪证被抓住，把阮詠棠擦血用的手帕几次冲洗，企图消灭罪证。特别令人不能容忍的是，奈温政府有关部门在审讯中竟敢肆意侮辱中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，妄想用卑鄙手段动摇爱国华侨热爱自己伟大领袖和伟大祖国的决心，那是绝对作不到的。
    中国大使馆再次要求缅甸政府必须立即无条件地释放所有无辜被捕华侨；对健康状况不好的陈伯甫、黄忠泉、阮詠棠和其他受刑、体弱多病无辜在押华侨必须马上释放；惩办迫害和毒打被捕华侨的凶手。
    照会说，如果缅甸政府仍然一意孤行，就必须对由此而引起的一切严重后果承担全部责任。
