	Beijing Municipal Transportation Company Automobile Repair Plant’s “Red Rebel Corps” has, with the line of “Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism,” overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, implemented Chairman Mao’s cadre policy, comprehensively viewed cadres, and boldly liberated cadres, uniting more than 95% of the revolutionary cadres in the entire factory.

	The “Red Rebel Corps” seized power in January, which caused a significant reaction among cadres. Some cadres resolutely supported their revolutionary actions and fought alongside them. However, many cadres did not understand or were displeased with their revolutionary actions, either forming their own organizations or joining organizations with differing views from the “Red Rebel Corps.”

	Why did so many cadres have such strong opposition to them? The comrades of the “Red Rebel Corps” used Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, analyzed the class struggle situation in their factory, and found the answer. The factory had 43 middle-level and above leaders. In the early stages of the movement, the work team, upon entering the factory, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, labeling 60% of the cadres as “black elements” and making them “stand aside.” They then labeled the revolutionary actions of the masses exposing a handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory as “counter-revolutionary incidents.” The work team thus stirred up the masses to fight the cadres and the cadres to fight the masses, creating a serious rift between the masses and the cadres. After analysis, the comrades of the “Red Rebel Corps” realized that to eliminate the cadres’ opposition, they could not handle the issue with petty-bourgeois factionalism just because the cadres joined organizations opposing them; they had to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, free the majority of cadres from the spiritual shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line, and strictly implement Chairman Mao’s cadre policy to educate and unite the majority of cadres.

	Through the thorough criticism of China’s Khrushchev, the old Beijing Municipal Committee’s counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and the factory’s capitalist-roaders, the cadres’ understanding of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party deepened rapidly. The deeper the criticism went, the more the cadres recognized their own mistakes, and the closer they became to the revolutionary masses. There was an organization called “Unified Call,” which was formed with eight middle-level cadres as its core and opposed the “Red Rebel Corps.” Through revolutionary criticism, they realized that their direction was wrong, withdrew from the original “Unified Call,” formed the “Smash Self, Establish Public” Combat Team, and joined the “Red Rebel Corps.”

	Based on the broad appearance of cadres, the “Red Rebel Corps,” following Chairman Mao’s instructions to view cadres comprehensively and historically, organized the masses to conduct a general ranking of middle-level and above cadres. During the ranking, they particularly emphasized using class analysis to view cadres, not factional views. For cadres who had taken the wrong side, they did not use the method of elevating them but, while pointing out their mistakes, gave them the opportunity to strive to be good or relatively good cadres. A middle-level cadre had made relatively serious mistakes in his daily work and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the movement. During the cadre ranking, the revolutionary masses conducted a comprehensive and realistic analysis of him, concluding that although he had made relatively serious mistakes, he was fundamentally still a relatively good cadre. The masses said: “We are not doing this to ‘remove officials’ or to ‘replace people,’ but to help cadres who have made mistakes change their thinking.” The cadre said emotionally: “I haven’t slept for several nights, always thinking about the many mistakes I made. The ‘Red Rebel Corps’ must have wanted to overthrow me, but I didn’t expect you to ‘punish past mistakes and cure the sick to save them,’ truly acting according to Mao Zedong Thought.” This cadre was originally a core member of the organization opposing the “Red Rebel Corps.” The “Red Rebel Corps” handled his issue without petty-bourgeois factionalism, which promoted his voluntary examination of his mistakes and eliminated the differences between the two organizations.

	For cadres who stood on their side, the “Red Rebel Corps” did not shield their mistakes but helped them seriously examine their mistakes and move forward lightly. The original deputy head of the Political Department of the factory party committee returned to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line under their enthusiastic help.

    北京市运输公司汽车修理厂无产阶级革命派
    全面地看待干部  大胆地解放干部
    本报讯　北京市运输公司汽车修理厂“红色造反团”，以“斗私，批修”为纲，克服小资产阶级派性，贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，全面地看待干部，大胆地解放干部，团结了全厂百分之九十五以上的革命干部。
    “红色造反团”一月份夺权，在干部里面引起了很大的反响。有一些干部坚决支持他们的革命行动，跟他们战斗在一起。但是，也有不少干部对他们的革命行动不理解，看不惯，或自己打出旗号成立组织，或参加与“红色造反团”持不同观点的组织。
    为什么不少干部跟自己对立的情绪这么大呢？“红色造反团”的同志以毛泽东思想为武器，通过对本厂阶级斗争形势的分析，找到了问题的答案。这个厂有四十三名中层以上的领导干部。运动初期，工作组一进厂就执行资产阶级反动路线，把百分之六十的干部打成“黑帮”，让他们统统“靠边站”。紧接着又把革命群众揭发厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命行动，打成
  “反革命事件”。工作组就是这样一方面挑动群众斗干部，一方面挑动干部整群众，造成了群众与干部之间的严重对立。经过分析，“红色造反团”的同志认识到，要消除干部的对立情绪，绝不能因为他们参加了同自己对立的组织，就用小资产阶级派性来处理问题；必须高举革命批判的大旗，使广大干部从资产阶级反动路线的精神枷锁中解放出来，同时必须严格地执行毛主席的干部政策，教育和团结干部的大多数。
    通过对中国的赫鲁晓夫、对旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团以及本厂走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，迅速提高了干部对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想罪行的认识。大批判搞得越深透，干部对自己的错误认识越深刻，同革命群众的感情也越接近。有个“齐声唤”组织，是由八个中层干部为核心组织起来的，与“红色造反团”闹对立。经过革命的大批判，他们认识到自己的大方向错了，就退出了原来的“齐声唤”，成立了“破私立公”战斗队，并加入了“红色造反团”。
    通过大批判，在干部广泛亮相的基础上，“红色造反团”遵循毛主席关于全面地、历史地看待干部的教导，发动群众对中层以上干部进行了一次普遍排队。在进行排队时，他们特别强调对待干部要用阶级分析的观点，而不用派别的观点。对站错队的干部，不用拔高的办法，而是在指出他们错误的同时，给他们机会争取作为好的或比较好的干部。有个中层干部在平时工作中有较严重的错误，运动中又执行了资产阶级反动路线。在进行干部排队时，革命群众对他做了全面的实事求是的分析，认为他虽有较严重的错误，从本质上看还是比较好的。群众说：“我们不是为了‘罢官’，也不是为了换人，而是要帮助犯错误的干部换思想。”这个干部感动地说：“我几夜都睡不着觉，总想我过去做了那么多错事，‘红色造反团’一定会把我打倒，没想到你们‘惩前毖后，治病救人’，真是按照毛泽东思想办事。”这个干部原来是“红色造反团”对立面组织的领导核心成员。“红色造反团”这样不带小资产阶级派性去处理他的问题，就促进了他自觉地检查自己的错误，而且消除了两个组织之间的分歧。
    “红色造反团”对站在自己一边的干部，也不袒护他们的错误，而是帮助他们认真检查自己的错误，轻装上阵。原厂党委政治处副主任就是在他们的热情帮助下重新回到毛主席的革命路线上来的。
