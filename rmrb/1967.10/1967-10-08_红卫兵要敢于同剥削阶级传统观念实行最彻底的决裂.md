Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a sweeping away of all the traditional ideas of the exploiting classes over several thousand years. It is an unprecedented revolutionary undertaking in human history to break with the old and establish the new.

In all societies with exploitative systems in history, the exploiting classes, to squeeze out the last bit of flesh, blood, and marrow from the laboring people, established a complete set of ideological systems to maintain private ownership of the means of production and their reactionary political rule—a worldview of selfishness. Although this worldview has different manifestations in slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society, its common point is a filthy "self." The reactionary ruling classes of all ages used the cultural and educational tools they monopolized to deceive, fool, and numb the laboring people, especially to poison the younger generation. Therefore, the selfish worldview that emerged with private ownership has a deep social foundation over several thousand years.

After the reactionary rule of the landlord and bourgeoisie was overthrown by the proletariat, the rotting corpse of the exploitative system still emits a foul odor. The exploiting classes still use their considerable influence in the ideological realm to control many positions and oppose the proletariat. Imperialism and domestic and foreign reactionaries, based on the changes in the Soviet Union, particularly place their hopes of "peaceful evolution" on our younger generation. They strive to corrupt the youth with bourgeois worldviews, attempting to cultivate our next generation into successors of the bourgeoisie to achieve a capitalist restoration in China.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communism is the whole ideological system of the proletariat and at the same time a new social system. This ideological system and social system are distinct from any other ideological system and any other social system. It is the most complete, most progressive, most revolutionary, and most rational in the history of mankind since its inception."

During the entire historical period of transition from capitalism to communism, the proletariat must consolidate the socialist public ownership economy and proletarian dictatorship. This requires breaking with the old ideology that maintains and restores private ownership of the means of production and promoting a worldview of selflessness and communism. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to mold a new generation.

As Marx and Engels pointed out: "The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development moves in the most radical rupture with traditional ideas."

Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a thorough revolution under proletarian dictatorship to smash all ideological systems of the exploiting classes. The fundamental goal of our great leader Chairman Mao's "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and carry the struggle through" is to achieve the ideological transformation of people.

The younger generation of our country, nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought, is the most eager to learn and the least conservative, more readily accepting the communist worldview and Mao Zedong Thought. They have energetically taken to the political stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, charging into battle and launching attacks on the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. Their achievements will forever be recorded in the annals of proletarian revolution.

However, it must be noted that after our country's liberation, for a long period, there existed the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools. The past educational system was basically that of feudalism, capitalism, and modern revisionism. The bourgeoisie used the cultural and educational positions they occupied to instill bourgeois worldviews into young students. The ghosts of the ideological systems of the exploiting classes still haunt our schools. At the same time, our country is a country with a large population of petty-bourgeoisie, and petty-bourgeois ideas also infiltrate our youth through various channels. Moreover, intellectuals, when not united with the worker-peasant masses, have working conditions for individual mental labor that are very close to the living conditions of the petty-bourgeoisie. This often causes them to drift away from the broad ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces, forming a series of petty-bourgeois political and ideological characteristics. Therefore, the task of transforming the bourgeois worldviews in the minds of our intellectuals, including young students, is still long-term and arduous.

Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "Intellectuals, before they unite with the revolutionary struggles of the masses and before they decide to serve the interests of the masses and unite with them, often have tendencies of subjectivism and individualism. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering. Therefore, although the broad revolutionary intellectuals in China have the role of vanguard and bridge, not all of these intellectuals can revolutionize to the end. Among them, a part will, at the critical moment of the revolution, withdraw from the revolutionary ranks and take a negative attitude; a few will even become enemies of the revolution. The shortcomings of intellectuals can only be overcome in long-term mass struggles."

Currently, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of achieving comprehensive victory. The changing positions of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and the development of class struggle in depth have caused a great shock to the depths of everyone's soul. At the same time, it has increasingly exposed the weaknesses of young students, the differences between petty-bourgeois ideas and actions and the revolutionary essence of the proletariat, and the incompatibility of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In our revolutionary ranks, especially in revolutionary student organizations, some wrong tendencies have emerged, such as the political vacillation of going to extremes and swinging left and right, from fervor to leisure; the petty-bourgeois factionalism that places the interests of small groups above the interests of the Party; the bourgeois pragmatism and vulgar style. These are all tenacious manifestations of the bourgeois worldview and the residual influence of the ideological systems of the exploiting classes over several thousand years. If these wrong tendencies are not corrected in time, they may become serious obstacles to the development of the revolution. Engels pointed out: "Old traditions are a great obstacle, a historical inertia. But it is passive, and therefore it must be destroyed." Some comrades, consciously or unconsciously, treat these old traditions as treasures, even dressing them up in various beautiful clothes, insisting on using bourgeois worldviews to transform the world. We must shout: Comrades! Your way is not working. The proletariat cannot accommodate you. If we follow you, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will go astray, and the victories we have achieved will be in danger of being lost.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to transform the world includes the following tasks: transforming the objective world and also transforming one's subjective world—transforming one's ability to recognize and the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world."

The future of our motherland and the hope of humanity are placed on our younger generation. They should make their thoughts adapt to the leapfrog development of human history and continuously align their subjective world with the laws of development of the objective world.

The train of the times is roaring forward. The ideological systems and social institutions of feudalism have already entered the history museum. The ideological systems and social institutions of capitalism are already gasping for breath, on the verge of extinction, under the impact of the great revolutionary tide. Only communism, with its brilliant light, illuminates the earth and guides the path of human progress.

Red Guards, you must spit out the vile and filthy ideas of the old world, dare to smash the spiritual shackles in your minds, and trample down all kinds of bourgeois goods such as selfishness, small-groupism, sectarianism, and anarchism. Make a complete break with the traditional ideas of the exploiting classes over several thousand years, and arm your minds with the most complete and thorough proletarian revolutionary worldview—the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. Become new people of the great era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner.

Red Guards, you must dare to launch a fierce struggle and conflict between collectivism, communism, and individualism in your minds. In the process of using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize bourgeois ideas and in the process of uniting with the worker-peasant masses, continuously dissect yourself, continuously engage in self-criticism, fundamentally transform your worldview, and cultivate yourself into a reliable successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Only in this way can the great struggle of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and carry the struggle through" be carried through to the end, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be carried through to the end.

Only in this way can we ensure that our country will forever march forward on the path of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, achieving eternal victory.

    红卫兵要敢于同剥削阶级传统观念实行最彻底的决裂
　　任立新
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是对几千年来一切剥削阶级传统观念的大扫荡，是人类历史上空前未有的破旧立新的伟大革命事业。
    在历史上一切剥削制度的社会中，剥削阶级为了把劳动人民最后一根筋骨、一块肌肉、一滴血都榨取干净，确立了一整套维护生产资料私有制及其反动政治统治的思想体系——利己主义的世界观。尽管这种世界观，在奴隶社会，封建社会，资本主义社会有着各种不同的表现形式，但是它的共同点是一个肮脏的“私”字。历代反动统治阶级，利用他们所垄断的文化教育等工具，去欺骗、愚弄和麻醉劳动人民，特别是毒害青年一代。因此，几千年来伴随私有制产生的利己主义世界观，有着根深蒂固的社会基础。
    在地主资产阶级的反动统治被无产阶级推翻以后，剥削制度那具腐烂的僵尸还散发着臭气。剥削阶级还利用他们在思想领域中占有的相当大的势力，控制着许多阵地，同无产阶级相对抗。帝国主义和国内外反动派，根据苏联发生的变化，特别把“和平演变”的希望，寄托在我国青年一代的身上。他们竭力用资产阶级世界观腐蚀青年，妄图把我们的下一代培养成为资产阶级的接班人，以便在中国实现资本主义复辟。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。”
    在由资本主义向共产主义过渡的整个历史时期中，无产阶级要巩固社会主义的公有制经济，巩固无产阶级专政，就必须破除那些维护和恢复生产资料私有制的旧意识形态，就必须提倡一心为公的共产主义世界观，用毛泽东思想塑造一代新人。
    正如马克思和恩格斯指出的那样：“共产主义革命就是同传统的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；毫不奇怪，它在自己的发展进程中要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂。”
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，就是在无产阶级专政下彻底摧毁一切剥削阶级意识形态的大革命。我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“斗私，批修”，实现人的思想革命化，就是这场大革命的根本目的。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的我国青年一代，他们最肯于学习，最少保守思想，比较地容易接受共产主义世界观，比较地容易接受伟大的毛泽东思想。他们朝气蓬勃地登上了无产阶级文化大革命的政治舞台，驰骋沙场，冲锋陷阵，对剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯展开了猛烈的进攻。他们的功勋，将永远载入无产阶级的革命史册。
    但是，必须看到，我国解放后，长时期内存在着资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。过去的教育制度，基本上还是封建主义、资本主义和现代修正主义的那一套。资产阶级利用他们所盘踞的文化教育阵地，向青年学生灌输资产阶级的世界观。剥削阶级意识形态的阴魂，还在我们的学校里游荡。同时，我国又是一个小资产阶级人口众多的国家，小资产阶级思想也通过各种渠道，侵蚀着我们的青少年。此外，知识分子在未同工农群众相结合时，其个体脑力劳动的工作条件与小资产阶级的生存条件十分接近，这就使他们往往游离于广大的无产阶级革命队伍之外，形成了一系列小资产阶级的政治和思想的特征。因此，我国的知识分子，包括青年学生在内，他们改造自己头脑中资产阶级世界观的任务，还是长期的，艰巨的。
    毛主席深刻地指出：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。因此，中国的广大的革命知识分子虽然有先锋的和桥梁的作用，但不是所有这些知识分子都能革命到底的。其中一部分，到了革命的紧急关头，就会脱离革命队伍，采取消极态度；其中少数人，就会变成革命的敌人。知识分子的这种缺点，只有在长期的群众斗争中才能克服。”
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了夺取全面胜利的新阶段。无产阶级革命派所处地位的变化，阶级斗争向纵深方向的发展，引起了每个人灵魂深处的大震动。同时，也越来越暴露出青年学生的某些弱点，暴露出小资产阶级的思想和行动同无产阶级革命性的本质区别，暴露出资产阶级、小资产阶级思想同无产阶级文化大革命的格格不入。
    在我们革命队伍中，尤其是在革命学生组织中，出现的某些错误倾向，例如好走极端，左右摇摆，从狂热到逍遥的政治动摇性；把小团体利益凌驾于党的利益之上的小资产阶级派性；资产阶级的实用主义和庸俗作风，都是资产阶级世界观的顽强表现，都是几千年来剥削阶级意识的残存影响。这些错误倾向，如果不及时纠正，就可能成为革命发展的严重障碍。恩格斯指出：旧的传统“是巨大的阻力，是历史的惰力。但是，它是消极的，因此一定要被摧毁。”有些同志却自觉不自觉地把这些旧传统当作宝贝，甚至还为它们披上种种漂亮的外衣，硬要用这种资产阶级世界观去改造世界。对此，我们必须大喝一声：同志！你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级是不能迁就你们的。依了你们，无产阶级文化大革命就要走上歧途，我们所取得的胜利就有丧失的危险。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。”
    在我国的青年一代身上，寄托着祖国的前途，人类的希望。他们应该使自己的思想适应人类历史的飞跃发展，不断使自己的主观世界和客观世界的发展规律一致起来。
    时代的列车呼啸着前进。封建主义的思想体系和社会制度，已经进了历史博物馆。资本主义的思想体系和社会制度，已经在大革命的怒潮的冲击下，气息奄奄，濒于灭亡了。惟独共产主义以其灿烂的光焰普照着大地，指引着人类前进的道路。
    红卫兵小将，要唾弃那些卑鄙污浊的旧世界的丑恶思想，勇于打碎自己头脑中的精神枷锁，把利己主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、无政府主义等形形色色的资产阶级货色统统踏倒，同几千年的剥削阶级传统观念作彻底的决裂，用最完全、最彻底的无产阶级革命世界观——光辉的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，做以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的伟大时代的新人。
    红卫兵小将，要敢于开展头脑里的集体主义、共产主义和个人主义剧烈的冲突和斗争，在用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级的过程中，在同工农群众相结合的过程中，不断地解剖自己，不断地进行自我批评，使自己的世界观来一番根本的改造，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的坚强可靠接班人。
    这样，才能把“斗私，批修”的伟大斗争进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    这样，才能保证我们国家千秋万代永远沿着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的道路胜利前进。
