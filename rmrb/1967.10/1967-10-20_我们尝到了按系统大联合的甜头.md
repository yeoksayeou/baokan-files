On the 18th, everyone was smiling, sitting together, studying and discussing the notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on implementing revolutionary great unity according to systems. Many comrades said, "Chairman Mao seems to have come to our factory to see us. Every word and sentence hit the mark. We have experienced the practice of achieving revolutionary great unity according to systems and feel that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the most brilliant and correct! Following Chairman Mao, we can overcome any difficulty; following Chairman Mao, we will achieve victory!"

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries, through revolutionary criticism and struggle, deeply understand that: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." In July, our entire factory achieved revolutionary great unity according to workshops, departments, and sections. Previously, the four revolutionary mass organizations each acted independently, occupying their own territories, and sometimes even fought "internal wars." Under such circumstances, we could not effectively implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and both revolution and production were affected to some extent. After achieving revolutionary great unity according to systems, the situation changed significantly.

Over the past three months, we have experienced four major benefits: First, we unified the organization, unified our thoughts, and unified our steps. Together, we organized the study of Chairman Mao's works, which greatly promoted the thought revolution among the workers. Now, in addition to the factory-wide Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we have also set up Mao Zedong Thought evening study classes according to workshops, departments, and sections, raising the study of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire factory to a new level. Second, we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and act swiftly. As soon as Chairman Mao gives an order, whether to criticize and repudiate revisionism, we immediately respond; when Chairman Mao issues a notice on implementing revolutionary great unity according to systems, we immediately hold large and small meetings in the entire factory, studying and understanding it over and over again. Third, we have maximally isolated the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and maximally united the revolutionary masses, making the revolutionary criticism and struggle develop further. When we first achieved revolutionary great unity, we only united 80% of the workers and cadres in the entire factory. Now, we have reached over 95%. Fourth, we have more powerfully implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." In the first nine months of this year, the output of water pumps in the entire factory increased by 17.54% compared to last year, and the output in September exceeded the highest monthly output since the factory was established.

Looking back at the three months since our factory achieved revolutionary great unity according to workshops, departments, and sections, it has been three months of rapid progress in both revolution and production, three months of significant advancement in the thought revolution of the people, and three months of further launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We are determined to continue to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well in the future, study the notice on implementing revolutionary great unity according to systems, and study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We will further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, correctly handle revolutionary cadres, quickly achieve the "three-in-one combination," and establish the factory revolutionary committee.

　　我们尝到了按系统大联合的甜头
　　济南水泵厂革命造反总部
    十八日，大家眉开眼笑，坐在一起，一遍又一遍地学习、讨论中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革关于按照系统实行革命大联合的通知。许多同志都说：“毛主席好象到我们厂里看过一样，字字句句都说到俺的心窝里。我们从自己已经按系统实现革命大联合的实践中体会到，毛主席的最新指示最最英明！最最正确！跟着毛主席，什么困难都能克服，跟着毛主席，就是胜利！”
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派，通过革命的大批判，深深认识到：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”今年七月份，我们全厂实现了按班组、按车间、按科室的革命大联合。过去，四个革命群众组织，各自为政，独占一方，有时甚至打“内战”。在这种状况下，毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，我们执行不得力，革命和生产都受到一定影响。实现按系统的革命大联合以后，情况发生了很大的变化。
    三个月来，我们从切身经历中尝到了四大甜头：一，是统一了组织，统一了思想，统一了步调，一起组织学习毛主席著作，有力地促进了职工的思想革命化。现在，除了全厂办的毛泽东思想学习班以外，还按班组、按车间、按科室开办了毛泽东思想业余学习班，使全厂毛泽东思想的学习提高到一个新的水平。二，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，闻风而动。毛主席一声令下，要斗私，批修，我们全厂职工立即响应；毛主席发出按系统实行革命大联合的通知，我们全厂当天开了大会、小会，一遍遍地学，一遍遍地领会。三，最大限度地孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，最大限度地团结了革命群众，使革命的大批判更加向纵深发展。刚实现革命大联合时，我们只团结了全厂百分之八十的群众和干部，现在达到了百分之九十五以上。四，更加有力地贯彻执行了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，今年头九个月，全厂水泵的产量，比去年全年增长百分之十七点五四，九月份的产量，超过建厂以来的月产最高水平。
    回顾我们厂按班组、按车间、按科室实现革命大联合的三个月，是革命和生产突飞猛进的三个月，是人的思想革命化大大前进一步的三个月，是进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮的三个月。我们决心今后更加好好地活学活用毛主席著作，学习关于按照系统实行革命大联合的通知，学习毛主席一系列的最新指示，进一步在毛泽东思想基础上巩固和发展革命的大联合，正确对待革命干部，尽快地实现革命的“三结合”，成立厂革命委员会。
