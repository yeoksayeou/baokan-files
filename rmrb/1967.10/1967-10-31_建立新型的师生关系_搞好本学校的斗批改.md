Classes Resume, Revolution Advances: Improving the School's Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation is a struggle on the educational front between two classes, two lines, two paths, and two worldviews. Only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, immediately resuming classes and advancing the revolution, and thoroughly criticizing the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, can we thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's educational thoughts.

The revolutionary teachers and students of our school have resolutely responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao. In July, we achieved the resumption of classes and the advancement of the revolution. On this forward path, we have used Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to overcome various ideological obstacles in resuming classes and advancing the revolution. Initially, due to the influence of anarchist thoughts in some people's minds, the teacher-student relationship was very tense. Some students did not respect teachers, making some teachers afraid to approach students, and some even unwilling to teach. Most students could not sit still, preferring to run outside, charge ahead, feeling that resuming classes and advancing the revolution was "boring" and "not free." These erroneous thoughts seriously hindered the smooth progress of resuming classes and advancing the revolution. Facing this situation, under the leadership of the school revolutionary committee, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and "May 7" directive, as well as central documents and speeches by central leaders regarding the resumption of classes and the advancement of the revolution. We clearly recognized the importance of resuming classes and advancing the revolution, raising our ideological awareness. Some teachers who were previously afraid to approach students replaced the "fear" with "dare," actively going to the students, listening to their opinions, eliminating the estrangement between teachers and students, and establishing a new proletarian teacher-student relationship. Some students who previously did not want to come to school, after studying, realized their mistakes, and expressed their determination to resume classes well and improve the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. Now, the entire school is experiencing a new high tide of resuming classes and advancing the revolution, with attendance reaching 80%, and some classes reaching 100%. Even the past "carefree" students are now in school participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation with everyone.

Through study and practice, we have come to understand that resuming classes and advancing the revolution is an urgent need for the cultural revolution at this stage and an important measure for improving the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must take "Criticize Revisionism, Rectify the Self" as the key link, launch a more extensive and in-depth new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois educational system, and establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, turning the Thirteenth Middle School into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    建立新型的师生关系
    搞好本学校的斗批改
    青岛市十三中革命委员会
    复课闹革命，搞好本学校的斗批改，是教育战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线、两种世界观的斗争。只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，立即复课闹革命，用毛泽东思想彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，才能彻底贯彻毛主席的教育思想。
    我校广大革命师生，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，今年七月实现了复课闹革命。在前进的道路上，我们以毛泽东思想为武器，克服了复课闹革命中的各种思想阻力。开始，由于无政府主义思潮在一部分人脑子里作怪，师生关系很紧张，有的同学对老师很不尊重，弄得有的教师不敢接近学生，有的甚至不愿当教师。大部分同学坐不下来，总喜欢到外面去跑一跑，冲一冲，感到复课闹革命“没意思”，“不自由”。这些错误思想严重地阻碍着复课闹革命的顺利进行。针对这种情况，在校革命委员会的领导下，我们认真地学习了毛主席的“三·七”指示和“五·七”指示，学习了中央有关文件和中央负责同志关于复课闹革命的讲话，明确认识到复课闹革命的重要意义，提高了思想觉悟。一些原来不敢接近学生的教师，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，主动地到学生中去，听取学生们的意见，消除了师生之间的隔阂，建立了无产阶级新型的师生关系。过去有些同学不愿到学校来，通过学习以后，认识到自己的想法是错误的，表示一定要复好课，搞好本校的斗批改。现在，全校正掀起一个复课闹革命的新高潮，到校人数达到了百分之八十，有的班达到了百分之百。过去的“逍遥派”，也到学校和大家一起参加斗批改。
    通过学习和实践，我们认识到，复课闹革命是文化大革命发展到现阶段的迫切需要，是搞好学校斗批改的重要措施。我们一定以“斗私，批修”为纲，掀起一个更广泛更深入的斗批改的新高潮，大破资产阶级教育制度，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，把十三中办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
