The Romanian military officers' rest and recreation group led by Onuferiu Eugen arrived in China on September 8 for a nearly month-long visit, during which they toured various places and enjoyed their vacation. They departed Beijing by airplane this morning to return home.

Yesterday, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Li Tianyou, received the entire Romanian military officers' rest and recreation group and held a farewell banquet. At the banquet, Wang Huijiu, a responsible person from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, and Onuferiu Eugen both spoke.

During their stay in China, the Romanian military officers' rest and recreation group visited Beijing, Shanghai, Harbin, Jinan, and Qingdao, where they toured military units, factories, and schools. They also held discussions with revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and military personnel regarding the situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the military's support for the left.
