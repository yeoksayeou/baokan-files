The revolutionary masses of the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, uniting the majority of cadres in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism.

More than 90% of the middle-level and above leaders in the entire factory have stood up, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination.

According to Xinhua News Agency from Guiyang on the 25th, the revolutionary masses of the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory firmly follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao to "believe in and rely on the majority of cadres." In the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, they seriously, conscientiously, and warmly help revolutionary leading cadres correct their mistakes, boldly use them, and unite with them to carry out the revolution. This has resulted in more than 90% of the middle-level and above leaders in the factory standing up, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Firmly Believe in the Majority of Cadres

The revolutionary masses of this factory have realized through practice that whether or not to correctly handle cadres and boldly use revolutionary cadres is an important sign of whether one adheres to or not to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao said: "One must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should one look at a cadre's one-time one-event, but also at a cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." The revolutionary masses of this factory, following Chairman Mao's teachings, used the method of class analysis to conduct a historical and comprehensive analysis of the cadres. They analyzed each of the more than 50 leaders at the factory level and workshop and department levels, including the former Party Committee Secretary Yang Zongtian. Everyone agreed that the majority of cadres are good in their main aspects, their mainstreams are good. Although some of them, to varying degrees, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and had various shortcomings and mistakes, their contradictions with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are internal contradictions among the people. After serious analysis, the cadre ranks in the entire factory became clear.

In the Front Line of the Struggle Against Selfishness and Revisionism, Helping Cadres Liberate Themselves

Chairman Mao said: "Different kinds of contradictions can only be resolved by different kinds of methods." After distinguishing between enemies, friends, and ourselves, the revolutionary masses of this factory adopted different methods to solve and handle cadre issues. They concentrated their firepower to thoroughly criticize and resolutely overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. For revolutionary cadres, they warmly helped them completely break with the bourgeois reactionary line and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

At the beginning, some cadres who had made mistakes, although they had the desire to correct their mistakes, did not dare to boldly "come out" and instead sat in their rooms "reflecting in seclusion." The revolutionary masses told the cadres who had made mistakes: We hope you will quickly come to the masses and, together with us, overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. You can't carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end just by writing self-criticisms in seclusion. The revolutionary masses' words from the heart deeply educated the cadres who had made mistakes.

Whether revolutionary leading cadres dared to engage in face-to-face struggles against the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party was a severe test for them. At that time, some cadres had many concerns, fearing that exposing the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party would implicate themselves, fearing that the masses would hold them accountable and not let them go, and still did not dare to "come out." The revolutionary masses felt that to make cadres come to the front line of the struggle, boldly "come out," and stand up to revolution, they must first help them fight against the "selfishness" in their minds. Therefore, they organized these cadres to bring their ideological problems to the study of Chairman Mao's works, launching an attack on "selfishness." The broad revolutionary masses launched a new high tide of great criticism and great struggle within the factory, creating conditions for cadres to "come out" on the front line. The former deputy secretary of the factory Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, Wenquan, under the warm help of the revolutionary masses, seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, established the belief in fully trusting the masses, removed his concerns, and boldly exposed the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in power within the factory. His revolutionary actions were welcomed and supported by the revolutionary masses of the entire factory, and he set an example for cadres who had made mistakes to stand up to revolution.

Boldly Use Revolutionary Cadres, Further Liberate Revolutionary Cadres

Cadres, after being helped, dared to "come out" in the struggle, which was a good beginning for cadres to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. However, to politically and ideologically liberate cadres thoroughly, it is necessary to continue to help cadres grasp the transformation of their worldview in actual struggles. After revolutionary cadres "came out," the revolutionary masses fully trusted and boldly used them, working and struggling together with these cadres, helping them further transform themselves in actual struggles. The revolutionary masses of this factory called this "the continuation of liberating cadres." They, based on the actual needs of revolution and production and the specific situations of revolutionary cadres, after thorough discussion among the masses, arranged appropriate work for each of them. The former Party branch secretary of the cold forging workshop, Hu Ruixiang, had strong organizational abilities and relatively rich struggle experience. After he "came out," the revolutionary workers unanimously elected him to be in charge of the workshop revolutionary leading group. For a few middle-level cadres who had late awakening and had not yet "come out" well, they also arranged some work, letting such cadres correct their mistakes in actual struggles.

After the liberated cadres were arranged with work, the revolutionary masses in the factory loudly proposed: to continue to care for revolutionary cadres politically, to further help revolutionary cadres ideologically, and to strongly support revolutionary cadres in their work. They organized cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, invited them to participate in revolutionary mass organizations, and fight, labor, and study together with the revolutionary masses, breaking down "selfishness" and establishing "public-mindedness." Many cadres also, under the help of the revolutionary masses, through the struggle against selfishness, further liberated themselves politically and ideologically. Some cadres deeply felt: Mao Zedong Thought is indispensable, class struggle must not be forgotten, "selfishness" must not be fought, and ideological transformation must not be relaxed for a moment.

Help Cadres Establish a New Revolutionary Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses

Cadres have improved their understanding, and the masses have become more protective of cadres. The revolutionary masses in the factory respect the leadership of revolutionary cadres in their work, pay attention to establishing the authority of revolutionary cadres, and at the same time, supervise cadres to act according to Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly changing the old ways of the past, promoting the thought revolutionization of cadres. They also established regular criticism meetings to give feedback to cadres, assigned cadres to work in teams, and arranged for them to work shifts regularly, giving cadres more opportunities to interact with the masses. In this way, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, and they have come to understand each other better. Now, the spiritual outlook and attitude towards the masses of the revolutionary cadres in this factory are greatly different from before. Except for attending meetings and studying, they spend most of their time living among the masses. Therefore, the revolutionary great criticism in this factory is carried out vigorously, and the achievements in grasping revolution and promoting production are remarkable.

A member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, the person in charge of the Factory Production General Headquarters, and the former first deputy secretary of the Factory Party Committee, Wang Shiyuan (right one), participated in the "three-in-one combination" leading group and often went to the workshops to work with the workers. This is him studying Chairman Mao's quotations with the workers before the shift.

    贵州柴油机厂无产阶级革命派坚决执行毛主席的干部政策
    在斗私批修中团结干部的大多数
    全厂中层以上领导干部百分之九十以上站了出来，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和三结合
    据新华社贵阳二十五日电　贵州柴油机厂无产阶级革命派，坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，在斗私批修中，严肃地、认真地、热情地帮助革命领导干部改正错误，大胆地使用他们，团结他们一道革命，使这个厂中层以上领导干部百分之九十以上都站了出来，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
      坚决相信干部的大多数
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派在实践中体会到，是否正确对待干部，大胆使用革命干部，是坚持不坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。毛主席说：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派按照毛主席的教导，用阶级分析的方法，对干部进行了历史的全面的分析。他们对原厂党委书记杨宗田等五十多个厂一级和车间、科室一级的领导干部，逐个地进行了阶级分析。大家一致认识到，大多数干部的大节是好的，主流是好的，他们当中有些人虽然在不同程度上执行了资产阶级反动路线，有这样那样的缺点和错误，但是，他们和无产阶级革命派的矛盾是人民内部的矛盾。经过认真的分析，全厂干部队伍的阵线分明了。
  在斗私批修的第一线帮助干部自己解放自己
    毛主席说：“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派在分清了敌友我之后，就采取不同的方法去解决和处理干部问题。对党内走资本主义道路的当权派，他们集中火力，彻底批判，坚决打倒。对革命的干部，则热情地帮助他们同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    开始，有的犯了错误的干部虽有改正错误的愿望，但不敢大胆地站出来“亮相”，而是坐在房子里“闭门思过”。革命群众对犯错误的干部说：我们希望你赶快到群众中来，同我们一起，把党内走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗臭。你们只是关起门来写检讨，怎能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底呢？革命群众这些出自内心的话，深刻地教育了犯错误的干部。
    革命的领导干部，敢不敢向党内走资本主义道路当权派展开面对面的斗争，这对他们是一个严峻的考验。当时，有的干部顾虑重重，怕起来揭发党内走资本主义道路当权派的罪行会牵连自己，怕群众会把自己揪住不放，仍然不敢起来“亮相”。无产阶级革命派感觉到，要使干部走上斗争第一线，大胆“亮相”，站出来革命，首先还要帮助他们狠斗头脑里的“私”字。于是，他们组织这些干部带着思想上的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，向“私”字开火。广大革命群众在厂内掀起了一个大批判、大斗争的新高潮，为干部“火线亮相”创造了条件。原厂党委监委副书记温泉，在无产阶级革命派的热情帮助下，认真学习毛主席著作，确立了充分相信群众的信念，解除了顾虑，大胆地揭发了厂内走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。他的革命行动受到全厂无产阶级革命派和革命群众的欢迎和支持，他为犯错误的干部站出来革命树立了榜样。
      大胆使用革命干部，进一步解放革命干部
    干部经过帮助，敢于在斗争中“亮相”，这是干部回到毛主席革命路线上来的一个良好开端。但是，要使干部从政治上、思想上彻底得到解放，还必须继续在实际斗争中帮助干部狠抓世界观的改造。当革命干部“亮相”以后，无产阶级革命派就充分信任，大胆使用，和这些干部一起革命，一起工作，帮助他们在实际斗争中进一步改造自己。这个厂的无产阶级革命派，把这样做叫做“解放干部的继续”。他们根据革命和生产的实际需要，以及革命干部的具体情况，经过群众的充分讨论，都给安排了适当的工作。冷冲车间原党支部书记胡瑞祥，组织能力比较强，又有比较丰富的斗争经验，在他“亮相”后，革命职工就一致选他担任车间革命领导小组的负责工作。对于个别觉悟较迟，还没有很好地“亮相”的中层干部，他们也安排一定的工作，让这样的干部在实际斗争中改正错误。
    当解放了的干部安排工作之后，厂里的无产阶级革命派又响亮地提出：要在政治上继续关心革命干部，在思想上进一步帮助革命干部，在工作上大力支持革命干部。他们组织干部活学活用毛主席著作，吸收他们参加革命群众组织，同无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，劳动在一起，学习在一起，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。不少干部也都在革命群众的帮助下，通过斗私，进一步从政治上、思想上得到了解放。有的干部深有体会地说：毛泽东思想离不得，阶级斗争忘不得，“私”字不斗了不得，思想改造一刻也放松不得。
    帮助干部建立崭新的革命的干群关系
    干部提高了认识，群众也更加爱护干部。厂里的无产阶级革命派，在工作上都尊重革命干部的领导，注意树立革命干部的威信，同时，监督干部按照毛泽东思想办事，彻底改变过去的一套旧作风，促使干部思想革命化。他们还建立了定期向干部提意见的批评会，把干部分配到班组，定点、定期顶班劳动，让干部有更多的机会和群众接触。这样，干部和群众的关系更密切了，互相间也更了解了。现在，这个厂的革命干部的精神面貌和对待群众的态度，都和以往大不相同。他们除了开会、学习以外，大部分时间都生活在群众当中。因此，这个厂的革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，抓革命、促生产成绩显著。（附图片）
