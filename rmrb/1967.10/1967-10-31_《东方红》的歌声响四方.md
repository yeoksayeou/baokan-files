Several blind veterans who live by the Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi, Vietnam, were all wounded during the Dien Bien Phu battle in the anti-French war. One day, Chinese comrades invited them to share stories about their anti-French battles. At the end of the report, the Chinese comrades gave them several Chairman Mao badges and a plaster statue of Chairman Mao. These blind veterans were extremely moved; they touched and kissed the badges and statue repeatedly, tears welling up in their eyes as they said, "If only we had been blind a few years later, so we could have seen Chairman Mao's image!" One of the blind veterans then stood up, took out a small flute from his side, and played "The East Is Red" with deep affection. This was not an ordinary song; it was a melody from the heart of a Vietnamese People's Army soldier, expressing their love for Chairman Mao.

	"I Want to Be a Good Student of Chairman Mao"

	"In the east the red sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." This is the favorite song of a student from Upper Volta who is studying in an Eastern European country. He learned it from the Beijing Radio Station. He often uses this song to express his deep feelings for Chairman Mao. Under his pillow, he always keeps "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Mao Zedong's Military Writings," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." No matter how busy he is, or how late he sleeps, he always sets aside time every night to study Chairman Mao's works. When he encounters reactionaries in debates, he uses Chairman Mao's quotations to refute them. When he meets Chinese comrades, he often raises both hands and shouts in fluent Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" He also knows how to sing "The East Is Red" in Chinese. When he bids farewell to Chinese students returning home, he earnestly says, "Please convey my respects to Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao! Tell Chairman Mao: I am reading his books, and I want to be his good student."

	"Teach Us to Sing 'The East Is Red'"

	Students from a school in Kulikor, far from the capital of Mali, were overjoyed to visit the Chinese Dazhai exhibition in Bamako. Everyone dressed in their best clothes, as if celebrating a festival. Unfortunately, the truck broke down halfway due to heavy rain. The rain soaked everyone's clothes. Despite being wet, the students eagerly asked the Chinese comrades to teach them their favorite song, "The East Is Red."

	"Our Whole Family Can Sing 'The East Is Red'"

	A female student from Mali once visited the Chinese Dazhai exhibition in the capital, Bamako. She spontaneously sang "The East Is Red" in fluent Chinese with a clear and resonant voice. Her melodious singing attracted many people and received the warmest welcome. Someone asked her in admiration, "You sing so well, how did you learn it?" She smiled and replied, "This famous song of praise was taught to me by my sister from Guinea. My sister taught it to our whole family. Not only do I know how to sing it, but everyone in our family, from the eldest to the youngest, knows how to sing it, and they sing it even better than I do."

	"Mao Zedong, You Are the Eternal Red Sun"

	Exiled revolutionaries from Yugoslavia love to sing "The East Is Red." They often compose their own songs to praise the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people—Chairman Mao. A Yugoslav revolutionary wrote in a poem titled "To Mao Zedong":

	Mao Zedong, you are the eternal red sun,
	You are the sun of freedom, truth, and proletarian unity,
	You are the source of new brotherhood,
	You are the savior of the working people,
	You are the dawn of happiness!

    《东方红》的歌声响四方	盲人的心愿
    越南河内还剑湖畔住着几位盲人，他们都是在抗法战争时期奠边府战役中负伤的荣誉军人。一天，中国同志邀请他们来讲抗法战斗故事。报告结束时，中国同志送给他们几枚毛主席像章和一个毛主席石膏像。这几位盲人激动极了，把毛主席像章和石膏像摸了又摸，亲了又亲，热泪盈眶地说：“如果我们晚盲几年，让我们看看毛伯伯的像该多好啊！”有位盲人同志这时站起来摸出了身边的短笛，情深谊长地吹起了《东方红》。这不是一支普通的歌，这是发自一个越南人民军战士肺腑的声音，它倾吐了他们热爱毛主席的心愿。	“我要做毛主席的好学生”
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”这是在东欧一个国家学习的一位上沃尔特学生最喜欢唱的一支歌。这是他从北京广播电台上学来的。他常用这支歌来表达他对毛主席的千情万意。他枕头下一直放着《毛泽东选集》、《毛泽东军事文选》和《毛主席语录》。不管多么忙，不管睡得多么晚，每天晚上他总要抽出时间学习毛主席著作。遇到同反动家伙辩论时，他就运用毛主席语录对他们痛加驳斥。他见到中国同志时常常高举双手，熟练地用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”他还会用中文唱《大海航行靠舵手》。当他送别即将回国的中国留学生时，他语重心长地说：“请代我向毛主席和林彪同志致敬！告诉毛主席：我正在读他的书，我要做他的好学生。”“	教我们唱《东方红》吧”
    远离马里首都的库里科罗某学校的学生因为要到巴马科参观中国大寨图片展览，他们都高兴极了，人人象过节一样，穿上了自己最好的衣服。可是不巧得很，卡车开到半路，天就下起倾盆大雨来了。暴雨把同学们的衣服都淋透了。同学们到展览馆后，不顾身上湿淋淋的，就兴致勃勃地要求中国同志教他们唱最心爱的歌曲——《东方红》。	“我们全家都会唱《东方红》”
    马里一位女学生，有一次在马里首都巴马科参观中国举办的大寨图片展览时，情不自禁地用流利的中国话和响亮而圆润的音调，唱起了《东方红》。她那嘹亮的歌声吸引了许多人，受到了人们最热烈的欢迎。有的人怀着钦佩的心情问她：“你唱得这么好，是怎么学的呀？”她笑着回答说：“这支著名的颂歌是我姐姐从几内亚学来的。我姐姐又把它教给了我们全家。所以不仅我会唱，我们全家从老到少都会唱，而且唱得比我还好呢。”	“毛泽东，您是永远不落的红太阳”
    流亡在国外的南斯拉夫革命者最喜欢唱《东方红》。他们还常常自编歌曲歌颂世界革命人民心中的红太阳——毛主席。一位南斯拉夫革命者在他的一首题为《献给毛泽东》的诗中，唱出了南斯拉夫革命人民的心声：
    毛泽东，您是永远不落的红太阳，
    是自由，真理，无产阶级团结的太阳，
    您是崭新的兄弟情谊的源泉，
    您是劳动人民的救星，
    您是幸福的曙光！
