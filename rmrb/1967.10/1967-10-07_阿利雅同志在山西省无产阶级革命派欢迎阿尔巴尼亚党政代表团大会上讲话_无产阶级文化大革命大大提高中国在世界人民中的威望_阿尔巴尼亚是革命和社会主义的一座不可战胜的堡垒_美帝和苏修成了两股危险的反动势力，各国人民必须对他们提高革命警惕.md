Comrade Ramiz Alia, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Secretary of the Central Committee, delivered the following speech at the welcoming meeting of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation by the revolutionary masses of Shanxi Province on October 5:

Dear Comrade Li Fuchun, dear Comrade Liu Geping, dear comrades,

We, the members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, feel greatly honored to be able to meet with you, our dear comrades and friends, and the revolutionary working people of Taiyuan today. We bring you the warm, fraternal greetings of the Albanian people, the Party of Labour of Albania, and our beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha. We convey to you the deepest and most sincere revolutionary sentiments and respect from the Albanian people, the Party of Labour of Albania, and our closest and most esteemed friend, Comrade Mao Zedong.

We are particularly pleased to be able to meet the revolutionary masses of Taiyuan, the great industrial city of the People's Republic of China, and to be among the revolutionary masses of Shanxi Province, the second province in China to have smashed a handful of capitalist-roaders in power and established a revolutionary committee based on the "three-in-one combination." This is a significant fact that proves that the revolutionary masses of Shanxi have consistently held high the banner of the invincible thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, have bravely fought for the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and are determined to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward. We are very happy to have the opportunity to visit this great province of China, where the glorious and invincible banner of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is flying high, and to feel that we are being treated with great honor.

We have been in the People's Republic of China for only a few days, but these few days have been enough for us to feel the great revolutionary friendship and boundless love of the great brotherly Chinese people, the workers, Red Guards, soldiers, and peasants of China for the Albanian people, the Party of Labour of Albania, and our party and national leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is out of this lofty sentiment and the great revolutionary unity between our two parties and countries that the Albanian Party and Government Delegation has received an unparalleled warm and grand welcome in various places in China; the Chinese leaders and the brotherly people of the entire country have shown us great concern and love.

In these few days, the great revolutionary upsurge sweeping across the entire great People's Republic of China has left an indelible impression on us. The 700 million Chinese people are unwavering in their determination to advance the socialist revolution, guided by the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to final victory, to smash and overthrow the capitalist-revisionist line and the running dogs of China's Khrushchev, and to bravely fight against international imperialism, Khrushchev revisionism, and all reactionaries. Dear comrades, we, the representatives of the Albanian Labor Party and people, wish you greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This revolution will make People's China even stronger and an unparalleled socialist power.

The Albanian people are deeply concerned about the great victories you have achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and they are jubilant about it. Your resolute struggle, heroic spirit, and great achievements in all aspects of your efforts to strengthen and advance the great, revolutionary, socialist China are a great source of inspiration for us in building socialism, consolidating the people's power, and defending our country.

The purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is to further strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist position in the People's Republic of China, to seize power from a handful of traitors, to smash the capitalist-revisionist line and ideology, and to permanently eliminate the danger of capitalist restoration, degeneration into revisionism, and bourgeoisification. This revolution is not only crucial for the fate of the Chinese people and the socialist future of China but also has a direct bearing on the fate of world socialism and the revolutionary movement. The question of what kind of country China will become, whether it will be a great socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a red China illuminated by the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, or a country under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and revisionism; the question of which path China will take, whether it will be the path of revolution and communism or the path of counter-revolution and capitalist restoration, degeneration into revisionism, is a matter of vital importance. All revolutionaries, all true Marxist-Leninists, the peoples of all countries, and all those fighting for socialism, national liberation, and social liberation are directly concerned about this issue. The Albanian people and Party members, your comrades with the same goal and fellow fighters, firmly support China's Cultural Revolution. The victory of this revolution is the victory of the Mao Zedong line over the traitorous revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his running dogs, the victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, the victory of revolution over counter-revolution, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism over modern revisionism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made a great and principled contribution to Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and practice. The revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong in this revolution is a summary of the experience of socialist construction in China and other countries and a summary of the lessons of the counter-revolutionary revisionism that occurred in the Soviet Union. As the guiding principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and ensuring the unity of thought and action of the 700 million Chinese people, the revolutionary practice of Chairman Mao Zedong, which is currently achieving victory in China, is particularly significant. The broad and comprehensive revolutionary practice, especially the mass movement launched to overthrow traitors, class enemies, running dogs of the bourgeoisie, conspirators, and usurpers of power at all levels, has become a great ideological experience for the revolutionary movement.

The great victories achieved by the Chinese people so far clearly prove that the revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China is correct, that the completely revolutionary principles guiding the Chinese people are correct; they prove a great fact, that is, the Communist Party of China is a thoroughgoing banner of Marxism-Leninism, great People's China is an impregnable fortress of world revolution and socialism, and Comrade Mao Zedong is a great leader, a faithful successor to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has mobilized hundreds of millions of people and armed them with Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out extensive creative activities in all aspects of ideology, politics, economy, organization, military, and culture. This conscious and powerful revolutionary movement, in which workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and revolutionary cadres participate, has special historical significance. In this revolution, the Red Guards were born, who, under the leadership of the Party, according to the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, play a leading role in the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards movement has won the love and praise of the world with its resolute revolutionary actions, its sharp struggle to expose and break the remnants of the old world, and its actions to expose and overthrow a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. The Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao, who study the books of Comrade Mao Zedong, listen to the words of Chairman Mao, and act according to the words of Chairman Mao, not only wage a resolute and unyielding struggle against all exploiting classes and their ideologies, against imperialism, revisionism, and their running dogs, but also temper themselves into revolutionaries and reliable successors to the cause of communism. The cultivation and tempering of such a batch of young people loyal to the Party and the people's cause is a great victory and another guarantee for the future of Chinese socialism, which makes the dictatorship of the proletariat immune from any danger and keeps the socialist banner flying high and unstained forever.

Today, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters the decisive stage, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party have been bankrupted and overthrown, so the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries have become even more frantic. They have formed a chorus and are conducting the most despicable anti-China attacks, trying every means to smear the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong. The enemy's desperate anti-China movement is not unexpected. The faster the Cultural Revolution advances along its own path, the more frantic its enemies become. The more consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist position in China, the more the world reactionaries cannot contain themselves and the more frantic they become.

The vicious attacks of the American imperialists, the Soviet revisionist leaders, and the reactionaries of various countries on the Chinese Cultural Revolution do not indicate their strength but rather their weakness, indicating that the enemies of revolution and communism are in great panic, indicating that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has caused great turmoil in the international counter-revolutionary camp.

The Chinese Cultural Revolution is a new stage, a continuation and deepening of the socialist revolution. It has smashed the old ideology, culture, customs, and habits of the Chinese exploiting classes, defeated the hidden agents of the bourgeoisie and revisionism who have infiltrated the Party and usurped important government positions, smashed the plots and tricks of imperialism, revisionism, and international reactionaries, and smashed their illusions of counter-revolution and capitalist restoration in China. They regard the failure of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party today, the failure of China's Khrushchev and Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, Peng Dehuai, Tao Zhu, and others, as a failure that concerns their life and death, as a heavy blow to them. In fact, it is indeed so.

The achievements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, especially in the Khrushchev revisionist clique, have caused genuine panic. They are now at a loss due to fear and confusion. They see that the example and experience of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, especially the experience of mobilizing the broad masses of young people, the working class, and revolutionary cadres to overthrow traitors, are not just simple Chinese experiences. The anti-China movements of the Brezhnev, Kosygin, and all other revisionist cliques, and their slanderous and frantic attacks on the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, on the Cultural Revolution, show that they are trying to prevent the people of the countries ruled by the revisionists from knowing the principles and practices of this revolution, to block the people from analyzing their national situation with the invincible Marxist-Leninist theory, to block them from rising up according to the example of the Chinese Cultural Revolution to carry out a revolution to eliminate revisionist traitors and renegades.

But all these efforts are in vain, there is no way out and no hope. For more than a hundred years, the bourgeoisie and reactionaries of various countries have tried to block the spread of communist ideology and have spent a lot of money and effort to do so. To achieve this goal, they have used terror, police persecution, armed attacks, counter-revolutionary actions, various traitors and renegades, various opportunists, revisionists, Trotskyites, etc. Despite all this, the Marxist-Leninist ideology has never stopped its victorious march to the world. Marxist-Leninist ideology has occupied the minds and hearts of hundreds of millions of people and has become a great material force for changing the world. It is so now and will always be so.

The new running dogs of imperialist bourgeoisie—the Khrushchev revisionists—cannot stop the revolution from advancing on the road to victory. They cannot fool the peoples of various countries for long and cannot stop the awakening of the masses. We believe that the true Bolsheviks and revolutionaries, the working class, and revolutionary youth in the Soviet Union and other countries currently under revisionist rule will realize their serious historical responsibility to the entire international proletariat, rise up in revolution, and eliminate all traitors, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk, and put an end to the ugly betrayal of revisionism.

Comrades,

The fraternal Chinese people recently celebrated the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. During this period, your beautiful country has achieved great victories, and these victories are still growing and developing. The Albanian people are happy about the achievements you have made. They are very pleased to see the new upsurge in socialist construction in China today, which is the result of the enthusiasm and mass mobilization stirred up by the Cultural Revolution. Under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, by implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production," your industrial production, agricultural production, and scientific and technological fields are all in a very good situation. You are striving to build socialism with great enthusiasm, quickly, efficiently, and economically; you have achieved brilliant achievements in the great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. In all parts of China, one can see that the markets are prosperous and prices are stable. Now, industrial production has surpassed last year in both quantity and quality. The summer harvest and the ongoing autumn harvest prove that there is a bumper harvest in agriculture. The inspiring development is also clearly seen in other economic sectors. All this proves that your Party's line of following the revolutionary principle of self-reliance and building an independent, modern, and relatively complete industrial and agricultural system is being successfully implemented. The high level of scientific and technological achievements embodied in several successful nuclear tests, missile tests, and the first hydrogen bomb test is also proof of the proletarian revolutionary line followed by People's China.

The Albanian people, Party, and government sincerely congratulate all these victories. They congratulate People's China on its achievements in the development of nuclear weapons, which are events of great historical significance to all mankind, because they have dealt a devastating blow to the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of imperialists and revisionists, and to the beastly dreams of imperialists and revisionists to oppress the peoples of various countries through threats and brandishing modern weapons. The peoples of the world now see that the great People's China, which possesses nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles, is a means of strengthening peace and deflating the arrogance of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries. This has further boosted the morale of the peoples of various countries, strengthened their confidence in their own strength, and enhanced their courage to fight for national liberation and social liberation.

People's China is a bastion of peace and socialism; it actively supports the revolutionary struggles and liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries. Our beloved leader Comrade Hoxha has said: "We Albanian communists confidently say, especially in the current situation, the existence of the powerful, revolutionary People's Republic of China, the indomitable great Communist Party of China and its outstanding leader Comrade Mao Zedong, is a great fortune for the peoples of the world and for the freedom of the world, world peace, Marxism-Leninism, and the future of socialism."

The Cultural Revolution has further enhanced the prestige of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China in the ranks of the international communist movement and among the peoples of various countries fighting for freedom and independence.

Comrades,

Under the leadership of Comrade Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian people are enthusiastically striving to further deepen the socialist revolution in all aspects, as determined by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania held last November. The politically conscious and revolutionary-spirited working class, peasants, intellectuals, youth, and women of our country have begun to work hard to complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan. As the Fifth Congress of the Party pointed out, the Fourth Five-Year Plan will ensure the further development of productive forces, so as to more completely establish the material and technical foundations of socialism. Just as last year, this year, the second year, the results are quite satisfactory. Socialist Albania is changing its face extremely rapidly.

Our achievements are due to the correctness of the Party's general line, the mobilization of the working masses, and the people's initiative and creative spirit. These achievements are the result of the extensive educational work that the Party has carried out in the past and is currently carrying out to raise the ideological and political level of the working masses, to arm them with lofty revolutionary virtues, and to enable them to sacrifice everything for the revolution and the defense of the country.

Now, in our country, the entire Party, all mass organizations, and all working masses have been mobilized to carry out a series of important tasks that have been put on the agenda of the development of our country's social history to further develop the socialist revolution. Our Party has been faithful to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism since its founding, has consistently fought to establish and develop Party life according to Leninist principles, has continuously carried out class struggle within and outside the Party, has strengthened the Party and the people's power, has timely eliminated enemy elements and tools of the bourgeoisie and imperialism, and has carried out extensive educational work to raise the revolutionary spirit of the working masses in labor and life. Despite all this, our Party believes that the primary task is to continuously temper the Party and the people's power, to deepen the ideological and cultural revolution, to continuously carry out class struggle on all fronts, and to push forward the great process of revolutionizing state life.

The painful experiences of the Soviet Union and some other countries where revisionism has seized power show that the enemies of the revolution, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goal of making the Communist Party and the proletariat degenerate and restore capitalism, first try to eliminate the revolutionary spirit of the Communist Party members and the working masses. They try to disintegrate the Party ideologically and organizationally, to abolish the Leninist principles of establishing and developing Party life, to liberalize the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to weaken the class nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They try to make the Communist Party members and the masses apathetic and numb, to turn them into simple mechanical tools, to make them lose their way ideologically, to make them develop the tendency to put personal interests above collective interests, etc.

Based on the conditions of our country, our Party has led the struggle to further revolutionize the Party and state life, with the aim of ensuring the victory of socialism, making it immune to any danger of capitalist restoration from within or without, and carrying the socialist revolution to the end in the political, economic, and ideological fronts, to completely and successfully build socialism, and to lay a solid foundation for the development of communism. To this end, our country is carrying out a fundamental reform of the superstructure of society, to get rid of everything that does not conform to the socialist economic base we have established, to further improve the socialist social relations, especially to improve the production relations through correct and revolutionary means, and to carry out a large amount of comprehensive work to revolutionize people's thoughts and spirits, to instill in every worker the fighting slogans of our Party with profound ideological content: "Think, work, and live like a revolutionary."

In the process of revolutionizing the entire life of the Party and the state, the Party's correct and consistent class struggle line runs through it. Class struggle, even in a socialist society, is still the driving force of social progress. The process of revolutionizing the entire life of the Party and the state is the process of developing class struggle. Without this process, without carrying out class struggle, it is impossible to build socialism, and it is impossible to talk about the revolutionary education of the working masses. This process is developing resolutely along the mass line that our Party has always adhered to. Only by relying closely on the masses, mobilizing the masses to join the battle, and making the masses actively participate in state life, at the same time, allowing the masses to dare to express their opinions publicly, only in this way can the road to revisionism and capitalist restoration be blocked, only in this way can the cause of socialism and communism be defended and advanced. Under the leadership of the Party organizations at all levels, the struggle to further realize revolutionization, based on the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's speech on February 6 this year, has swept through all fields and strata of state life. In this way, many revolutionary initiatives and movements have been proposed and carried out in our country to oppose bureaucracy, to oppose the bourgeois husband's rights, customs, superstitions, religious superstitions, and all thoughts incompatible with proletarian thought. The thorough emancipation of women and the subordination of collective interests to individual interests occupy an important position in the revolutionization movement. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, especially the youth and women, through many discussions, criticisms, and self-criticisms, have severely criticized various manifestations that hinder our progress along the path of socialist construction, and at the same time, to effectively carry out their struggle, have taken many specific measures. The Party and the government fully support these initiatives.

The struggle to implement the Party's line, various initiatives, and movements have greatly enhanced the revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative of the people, and all these have strongly promoted the socialist construction of our country and the development of socialist democracy, raised the political and ideological level of the masses, further strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, and consolidated the position of socialism in Albania. The unity of the Party's ranks and the unity of the people with the Party and the Central Committee of the Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha have been further consolidated and strengthened.

The People's Republic of Albania, surrounded by savage and brutal enemies, is building socialism with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun. The imperialists, the Khrushchev and Tito revisionists, regard Albania as a thorn in their side and will not tolerate her revolutionary and internationalist position, her opposition to the reactionary policies of the Soviet Union and the United States, her support for the struggles of the peoples of various countries for national and social liberation, her defense of Marxism-Leninism, and her exposure of the traitors of revisionism. But all this does not harm the Albanian people. No threats, no pressure, no blockade can shake their trust in the Marxist-Leninist line of the Party of Labour, nor can they make them deviate from the correct revolutionary path of building socialism and defending the country, nor can they separate them from their true friends and force them to stop their resolute struggle against the imperialist and revisionist enemies. Albania will forever be an invincible fortress of revolution and socialism on the Adriatic coast.

Dear comrades,

The revolutionary struggles and liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries, the struggles of the great People's China, the People's Republic of Albania, and the revolutionary forces of the world against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet Union, have created a favorable international situation and created new possibilities for advancing the cause of revolution and socialism.

Today, we are witnesses to the great process of turmoil, shaking, and collapse of the imperialist and revisionist lines. The American imperialists, who want to realize Hitler's fascist dream of absolute world hegemony in the contemporary world, are being struck by the peoples of various countries, surrounded, and increasingly isolated. The American imperialists are finding it increasingly difficult to carry out their policy of aggression to seize land, political control, and economic control. Similarly, their accomplice, Soviet revisionism, is unable to extinguish the revolutionary and liberation struggles that have already been ignited. The peoples of the world have the courage to rise up against imperialism and defeat imperialism. They are no longer afraid of the military superiority and modern weapons of imperialism, nor are they afraid of the tricks and betrayals of modern revisionists. They are seeing more and more clearly that the only way to salvation is to make a revolution, to wage a resolute and uncompromising people's armed struggle against imperialism and reactionaries.

The Soviet revisionist group is increasingly exposing itself as a treacherous group against Marxism, a faithful accomplice of imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary and liberation movements of the peoples of various countries, maintaining the exploitative system of imperialist bourgeoisie and colonialism, and restoring capitalism in the socialist world. Currently, due to the great power chauvinism policy, economic pressure, and unrestrained interference in internal affairs executed by the Soviet leadership, the revisionist line is crumbling, in chaos, and nationalistic disputes are rampant, mutual opposition, jealousy, etc. With the wide opening of the door to the economic, cultural, and political infiltration of Western capital, the infiltration of the American way of life, this process of disintegration is becoming more and more intense. The baton has been broken into a hundred pieces, and each revisionist group is still walking its old path.

However, despite the heavy defeats suffered by the imperialist-revisionist camp, despite the fact that the enemies are being isolated and surrounded by the peoples of the world, they have not given up their conspiracies against the peoples of various countries fighting for freedom and independence, nor have they given up their struggles to seize the revolutionary victory fruits of the peoples of various countries and to oppress and enslave the peoples of various countries. The American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leaders, as shown by the meeting between Kosygin and Johnson in Glassboro, are more ruthlessly executing their joint dream of American-Soviet cooperation to conquer the world and divide spheres of influence. They are conspiring to extinguish the liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially to suppress and enslave the heroic Vietnamese people.

Now, the United States and the Soviet revisionists are trying their best to gather various reactionary forces together to form a "holy alliance" against revolution and China and to form an encirclement against People's China. In the joint suppression of the Soviet Union and the United States of the Vietnamese people's war of liberation and the attempt to make imperialism's slavery in that country permanent, one can better see the Soviet-American cooperation. When the United States is escalating military aggression, the Soviet revisionists are using all means to sabotage the struggle of the Vietnamese people and try to force them to sit at the negotiating table with the aggressors. But all the attempts of the imperialists and revisionists have failed and will continue to fail, because the Vietnamese people are determined that no matter how much suffering and sacrifice they will endure for the victory of their just cause, they will fight to the final victory.

The Soviet revisionists, just as in Vietnam, are opposing the Arab people, stabbing the Arab people in the back, and abandoning them at the most difficult time. In this regard, the Soviet revisionists have become the accomplices of American imperialism, traitors who betray their trust. They are willing to sell the interests of other peoples cheaply for the two superpowers to rule the world and are willing to sacrifice the freedom of other peoples at any time.

All this shows that the United States and the Soviet revisionists have become two dangerous reactionary forces, and the peoples of various countries must constantly be on high alert against them, because to defeat imperialism, one must also defeat revisionism with the same force and determination.

Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, our two parties and peoples are bravely fighting against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. The Chinese people and the Albanian people, the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, unreservedly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries and the struggles of the fraternal Vietnamese people. The struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people will certainly defeat the American aggressors and smash the tricks of revisionism. The peoples of China and Albania, the two parties, will fully support the struggle of the Arab people against the aggression of the United States and Israel, and fully support the liberation and revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This struggle has dealt a shocking blow to the position of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries on these continents. The Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, our two peoples, united as one, will forever hold high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, forever hold high the banner of revolution, and forever hold high the uncompromising banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism.

For all revolutionaries in the world, this year is a year of great celebration, the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. For revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists, a more beautiful and magnificent holiday is when the peoples of various countries actively participate in the revolution and in the struggle for the great cause of communism. In the 50th anniversary of the revolution, let us raise the banner of Leninism higher, strengthen our unity with all those who truly struggle for the cause of communism, strengthen the struggle against the number one enemy of the peoples of various countries—imperialism, strengthen the struggle against the traitors of the great October thought and the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, strengthen the struggle against the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Tito clique, and other revisionists. The thought of the October Revolution is a call to battle, a call to action. All true communists, all revolutionaries, should join the battle, join the action to overthrow the traitors. All revolutionaries, no matter where they are, should unite, sever ties with the revisionist parties, eliminate all illusions, establish Marxist-Leninist parties, and organize ruthless revolutionary struggles.

Dear comrades,

Our country is located in Europe, which is ruled by imperialism and revisionism, but it has never felt isolated or far from the many friends in the world, especially the 700 million Chinese people. Our country has formed an unbreakable friendship with the 700 million Chinese people. This friendship is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and is created by our two parties and two leaders, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

The Albanian people cherish this great friendship and are proud to have such a loyal and powerful brotherly friend as the Chinese people. The Albanian people and the Chinese people are fighting side by side against the common enemy of imperialism and revisionism. This friendship is a great revolutionary inspiration for the Albanian people and a powerful support for the construction of socialism and national defense in Albania. Our people are determined to continuously develop and strengthen the Albanian-Chinese friendship, firmly believing that this friendship not only serves the interests of the peoples of our two countries but also serves the interests of the great revolutionary cause of the world, the cause of socialism, and the cause of liberation.

There is no, and there will never be, any force that can harm the fighting friendship between the peoples and parties of Albania and China by a single hair. In his historic telegram of congratulations to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends who are honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted, not those two-faced people. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests." No matter what difficulties and storms appear on our common road to socialism, no matter what storms appear, our two peoples, under the leadership of their Marxist-Leninist parties, will forever hold high the banner of their friendship, help and support each other like brothers, and advance fearlessly to the great revolutionary battles that await us.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples and parties of Albania and China!

Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the most respected friend of the Albanian people!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!

Fraternal and warm greetings to the revolutionary masses of Taiyuan and Shanxi Province!

Glory to Marxism-Leninism!

    阿尔巴尼亚人民十分关切地注视着你们在以毛泽东主席为代表的革命路线的领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利，并为之而欢欣鼓舞。你们在为加强和推进伟大的、革命的、社会主义中国而努力的各个方面所作的坚决斗争、英勇气概和巨大成就，是对我们建设社会主义，巩固人民政权和防卫祖国的巨大鼓舞源泉。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的目的是在中华人民共和国进一步加强和巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义的阵地，夺取一小撮叛徒的权，粉碎资产阶级修正主义的路线和思想，永远消除复辟资本主义，蜕化为修正主义和资产阶级的危险。这场革命不仅对中国人民的命运，对中国的社会主义未来，并且对世界社会主义和革命运动的命运，具有切身攸关的意义。中国将成为一个什么样的国家这个问题，中国成为无产阶级专政的伟大的社会主义国家，马克思列宁主义学说、毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的红色中国，还是成为资产阶级和修正主义专政的中国这个问题；中国走什么道路的问题，是革命和共产主义的道路，还是走反革命和复辟资本主义、蜕化为修正主义的道路，这是具有切身意义的问题。全世界革命者、所有真正的马克思列宁主义者、各国人民、所有为争取社会主义、争取民族解放和社会解放而斗争的人们，都直接关心这个问题。阿尔巴尼亚人民和劳动党员，你们的同一目标的兄弟和共同斗争的同志，坚决支持中国的文化大革命。这场革命的胜利就是毛泽东路线战败中国赫鲁晓夫及其走狗的修正主义叛徒路线的胜利，就是无产阶级战败资产阶级的胜利，就是革命战败反革命的胜利，马克思列宁主义战败现代修正主义的胜利。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命对马克思列宁主义革命理论和革命实践的贡献是很大的，是具有原则意义的。毛泽东同志在这场革命中的马克思列宁主义革命路线，是对中国和其它国家社会主义建设中的经验总结，是对苏联发生修正主义反革命的教训总结。作为无产阶级文化大革命的指南，并保证了七亿中国人民的思想一致和行动一致的毛泽东同志的指导原则，目前正在中国取得胜利的广泛的、全面的革命实践，尤其是为了打倒叛徒、阶级敌人、资产阶级走狗、阴谋家和各级党政权力的窃取者而开展的广泛的群众运动，成了对革命运动具有重大思想意义的经验。
    中国人民迄今所取得的伟大胜利清楚地证明中国共产党的革命路线是正确的，指导中国人民的完完全全的革命原则是正确的；它们证明这样一个伟大的事实，即：中国共产党是彻底忠于马克思列宁主义的旗手，伟大的人民中国是全世界革命和社会主义的坚不可摧的堡垒，毛泽东同志是伟大的领袖，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的忠实的继承者。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命广泛地发动了亿万人民群众，并用毛泽东思想武装起来，在思想、政治、经济、组织、军事和文化等所有方面开展极为广泛的创造性活动。工人、农民、战士、学生和革命干部参加的这场自觉的、十分强大的革命运动，有着特殊的历史意义。在这场革命中，红卫兵诞生了，他们在党的领导下，根据毛泽东同志的教导，在文化大革命中起着首要的作用。红卫兵运动用自己果敢的革命行动，用揭露和打破旧世界残余的尖锐斗争，用揪出和打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的行动，赢得了全世界的热爱和赞扬。毛主席的红小兵，坚持读毛泽东同志的书，听毛泽东同志的话，照毛泽东同志的话办事，不仅同所有剥削阶级及其思想，同帝国主义、修正主义及其走狗进行了坚决的、始终不渝的斗争，同时还把自己锻炼为一个革命者，使自己成为共产主义事业可靠的接班人。造就和锻炼这样一批忠于党和人民的事业的年青一代是一个伟大的胜利，是对中国社会主义未来的又一保证，它使无产阶级专政免受任何危险，使社会主义旗帜永远高高飘扬，不受沾污。
    今天，由于无产阶级文化大革命进入了决战阶段，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经遭到破产，已经被打倒了，所以，帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派变得更加疯狂了。他们组成了大合唱，最卑鄙地进行反华攻击，千方百计地企图给伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席抹黑。敌人这种垂头丧气的反华运动并不是意料之外的事情。文化革命沿着自己的道路走得越快，它的敌人就越加疯狂。中国的无产阶级专政和社会主义的阵地越巩固，世界反动派就越加抑制不住自己，就越加疯狂起来。
    美帝国主义者、苏修领导人和各国反动派对中国文化大革命的恶毒攻击，不是说明他们的强大，而是说明他们的软弱，说明革命和共产主义的敌人十分恐慌，说明中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利在国际反革命营垒中引起了一片混乱。
    中国的文化革命，是一个新的阶段，是社会主义革命的继续和深入，它大破中国剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，打败了混进党内，并窃据了政府要职的资产阶级和修正主义的隐蔽的代理人，粉碎了帝国主义、修正主义和国际反动派的阴谋诡计，粉碎了他们企图在中国搞反革命和复辟资本主义剥削制度的妄想。他们把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派今天所遭到的失败，把中国的赫鲁晓夫和彭真、罗瑞卿、陆定一、彭德怀、陶铸等所遭到的失败，看成是他们的生死攸关的失败，是给他们的沉重打击。实际上也确实如此。
    中国文化革命的成就，特别是在赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团中，引起了真正的惊慌，他们由于恐惧和混乱，现在已不知所措。他们看到，中国文化革命的榜样和经验，特别是发动广大青年、工人阶级和革命干部起来打倒叛徒的经验，不仅仅是单纯的中国经验，勃列日涅夫、柯西金和所有其他修正主义集团的反华运动和他们对中国共产党和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，对文化大革命的诬蔑和疯狂攻击说明，他们力图阻止修正主义者统治的国家的人民知道这一场革命的原则和实践，阻挡人民用战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说来分析本国的形势，阻挡他们按照中国文化革命的榜样起来进行消灭修正主义叛徒和变节分子的革命。
    但是所有这一切都是枉费心机的，是找不到出路和任何希望的。一百多年以来，各国的资产阶级和反动派竭力阻挡共产主义思想的传播，并且为此动用了大量的资金和力量。为了达到这一目的，他们曾利用恐怖、警察迫害、武装进攻、反革命行动、各种叛徒和变节分子、各式各色的机会主义、修正主义者、托洛茨基分子等。尽管这样，马克思列宁主义思想一刻也没有停止它向全世界的胜利进军。马克思列宁主义思想占领了亿万人的思想和心灵，并且已成为改造世界的伟大物质力量。现在是如此，将来也必将如此。
    帝国主义资产阶级的新走狗——赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是无法阻挡革命在胜利的道路上发展的。他们不可能长期骗住各国人民，不可能阻挡群众的革命觉醒。我们相信，苏联和今天在修正主义统治下的其他国家的真正的布尔什维克和革命者、工人阶级和革命青年，必将意识到自己对整个国际无产阶级所担负的严重历史责任，起来进行革命，将消灭所有叛徒、赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，结束修正主义的丑恶背叛行为。
    同志们，
    兄弟的中国人民最近庆祝了中华人民共和国成立十八周年。在这一时期内，你们美好的国家取得了伟大的胜利，并且这些胜利还在日益增长和发展。阿尔巴尼亚人民为你们取得的成就感到高兴。他们以巨大的同情心情，十分高兴地注视今天中国的社会主义建设新高潮，这种新的高潮是文化革命激起的干劲和进行大动员的结果。在毛泽东同志为首的共产党的领导下，由于贯彻了毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，你们的工业生产、农业生产、科学技术方面，都呈现着一派大好形势。你们鼓足干劲，多快好省地建设社会主义；你们在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验伟大革命运动中，取得了光辉的成就。在全中国各地，都可以看到，市场繁荣，物价稳定。现在，工业生产已在数量和质量上超过去年。夏季收成和正在进行的秋收证明在农业方面是丰收。鼓舞人心的发展也清楚地表现在其他经济部门。所有这一切都证明，你们党遵循自力更生的革命原则，建设一个独立的、现代化的和比较完全的工农业体系的正确路线，正在成功地执行。几次原子弹试验、导弹试验和第一颗氢弹试验成功所体现的高度科学技术水平，也是人民中国所遵循的这条无产阶级革命路线的证明。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府衷心地祝贺这一切胜利。他们祝贺人民中国在发展核武器方面的成就，这些成就是全人类具有伟大历史意义的事件，因为它们给了帝国主义者和修正主义者的核垄断和核讹诈，给了帝国主义者和修正主义者为通过威胁和挥舞现代化武器的办法来压迫各国人民的野兽梦想以毁灭性打击。全世界人民现在看到，伟大的人民中国掌握核武器和运载工具，是加强和平，打掉帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派威风的手段。这就更加长了各国人民的志气，增强了他们对自己的力量的信心，提高了他们争取民族解放和社会解放的勇气。
    人民中国是和平和社会主义的堡垒；它积极支持各国人民的革命斗争和解放斗争，我们敬爱的领袖霍查同志说过：“我们阿尔巴尼亚共产党人满怀信心地说，特别是在当前的形势下，强大的、革命的中华人民共和国的存在，战斗的、忠实于马克思列宁主义的不屈不挠的伟大的中国共产党及其卓越的领袖毛泽东同志的存在，是世界人民及其自由、世界和平、马克思列宁主义和社会主义的前途的巨大幸运。”
    文化革命更加提高了中国共产党和中华人民共和国在国际共产主义运动的队伍中，在为自由和独立而斗争的各国人民当中的威望。
    同志们，
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在以霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，在去年十一月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会确定的道路上，正在满腔热情地为使社会主义革命在各方面进一步深入开展而努力。具有高度政治觉悟和健康的革命精神的我国工人阶级、劳动农民、人民知识分子、青年、妇女，已着手为完成第四个五年计划而努力了。正如党的第五次代表大会所指出的，第四个五年计划将保证生产力获得进一步的发展，以便更加完全建立社会主义的物质技术基础。象去年一样，今年，即第二年的成绩是相当令人满意的。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚正在极其迅速地改变它的面貌。
    我国取得成就，是由于党的总路线正确，是由于动员了劳动群众，是由于人民发扬了积极性和创造精神。这些成就是党过去和现在为在思想上、政治上提高劳动群众，为了用崇高的革命美德武装他们，为了使他们能为革命和保卫祖国牺牲一切所进行的广泛的教育工作的结果。
    现在在我国，全党、所有的群众组织和所有劳动群众都已发动起来，为执行社会主义革命不断发展提到我国社会历史发展这一阶段日程上的一系列重要任务了。
    我们党忠实地执行马克思列宁主义学说，从它成立以来，就始终不渝地进行斗争，遵守建立和发展党内生活的列宁主义准则，不断在党内外进行了阶级斗争，加强了党和人民政权，随时清除了敌对分子和资产阶级与帝国主义的工具，为提高劳动群众在劳动和生活中的革命精神进行了工作。尽管这样，我们党认为，首要任务是要不断地锻炼党和人民政权，深入开展思想和文化革命，不断在各个战线上进行阶级斗争，把国家生活革命化的伟大进程推向前进。
    苏联和其他修正主义篡夺了权的某些国家的沉痛经验说明，革命的敌人为了达到他们使党和无产阶级蜕化变质并实行资本主义复辟的反革命目的，首先力图消除共产党员和劳动群众的革命精神。他们力图从思想上、组织上瓦解党，取消建立和发展党内生活的列宁主义准则，使无产阶级专政自由化，削弱无产阶级专政的阶级性。他们力图使共产党员和群众消极、麻木不仁，把他们变成简单的机械工具，使他们在思想上迷失方向，使他们滋长把个人利益放在集体利益之上的倾向，等等。
    我们党根据我国的条件领导了使党和国家生活进一步革命化的斗争，其目的是要保证社会主义的胜利，使之不遭到任何从内部或从外部来的资本主义复辟危险，在政治、经济和思想阵线上把社会主义革命进行到底，保证完全地、成功地建成社会主义，并为向共产主义发展打下巩固的基础。为此，我国正在对社会的上层建筑进行一次根本的改革，使之摆脱一切不符合我们已经建立起来的社会主义经济基础的东西，进一步改进社会主义社会关系，特别是通过正确的、革命的途径，改进生产关系，正在进行大量的、全面的工作，使人的思想和精神革命化，向每一个劳动者灌输我们党的具有深刻思想内容的战斗口号：“象革命者那样思考、工作和生活。”
    在党和国家全部生活革命化的过程中，贯穿着党的正确的、一贯的阶级斗争路线。阶级斗争即使是在社会主义社会，也还是社会前进的动力。党和国家全部生活革命化的过程是阶级斗争发展的过程。没有这一过程，不进行阶级斗争就不可能进行社会主义建设，也谈不上劳动群众的革命教育。这一过程正坚决地沿着我们党所一贯坚持的群众路线向前发展。只有在紧紧依靠群众、发动群众投入战斗，使他们积极参与国家生活的同时，让群众敢于公开地发表自己的意见，只有这样才能堵塞修正主义和资本主义复辟的道路，才能捍卫社会主义和共产主义事业并将其推向前进。在各级党组织的领导下，以党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议和恩维尔·霍查同志今年二月六日讲话为纲的进一步实现革命化的斗争席卷了国家生活的各个领域和各阶层的劳动群众。这样，在我们全国各地提出了和开展了很多反对官僚主义，反对资产阶级的夫权、风俗习惯，宗教迷信思想，反对一切与无产阶级思想毫不相容的思想的革命倡议和革命运动。彻底解放妇女和把整体利益置于个人利益之上在革命化运动中占有一个重要的位置。广大的工人、农民和知识分子群众，特别是青年和妇女，通过多次的讨论，批评和自我批评，严厉地指责了那些阻碍我们沿着社会主义建设道路前进的各种表现，同时，为了他们的有效的斗争，采取了很多具体措施。党和政府完全支持这些倡议。
    为贯彻执行党的路线的斗争，各项倡议和运动，大大提高了人民的革命干劲和首创精神，所有这些都有力地推动了我国的社会主义建设和发扬了社会主义的民主，提高了群众的政治思想水平，进一步地加强了无产阶级专政，巩固了社会主义在阿尔巴尼亚的阵地。党的队伍的统一和人民群众与党与以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的党中央的团结进一步地巩固和加强了。
    处在野蛮的、残暴的敌人包围之中的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，在一手拿镐，一手拿枪地建设社会主义。帝国主义者、赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义者把阿尔巴尼亚视为眼中钉，他们不会容许她的革命的、国际主义的立场，她对苏、美反动政策的反对，她对各国人民为争取民族和社会解放而进行的斗争的支持，她对马克思列宁主义的捍卫和对修正主义叛徒的揭露。但是，这丝毫也无损于阿尔巴尼亚人民。任何恐吓，任何压力，任何封锁，都不能动摇他们对劳动党的马克思列宁主义路线的信任，都不可能使他们离开自己所选择的建设社会主义、保卫祖国的正确的革命道路，任何东西都不能使他们同自己的真正朋友分开，并迫使他们停止反对帝国主义和修正主义敌人的坚决斗争。阿尔巴尼亚永远是革命和社会主义在亚得里亚海边的一座不可战胜的堡垒。
    亲爱的同志们：
    各国人民的革命斗争和解放斗争，伟大的人民中国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、全世界反对帝国主义的革命力量所进行的反对以美国为首的帝国主义、反对以苏联修正主义为首的现代修正主义的斗争，创造了一派有利的国际形势，创造了把革命和社会主义事业推向前进的新的可能性。
    今天，我们是帝国主义和修正主义阵线动荡、动摇和崩溃这一大的过程的见证人。美帝国主义企图在当代来实现希特勒法西斯关于建立世界绝对霸权的痴心妄想，今天，它遭到了各国人民的打击，遭到各国人民的包围和越来越大的孤立。美帝国主义要推行它的霸占土地，进行政治控制和经济控制的侵略政策，是越来越困难了。同样，它的同伙苏联修正主义要想扑灭已经点燃起来的革命斗争和解放斗争的烈火，是不可能的了。世界各国人民有勇气起来反对帝国主义，并战胜帝国主义。他们不再害怕帝国主义的军事优势和现代武器，也不再害怕现代修正主义者的阴谋诡计和背叛行径了。他们越来越清楚地看到，获得拯救的唯一途径就是干革命，就是同帝国主义和反动派进行坚持到底的毫不妥协的人民武装斗争。
    苏修集团越来越暴露它是反马克思主义的叛徒集团，是帝国主义镇压各国人民革命和解放运动，维护帝国主义的资产阶级和殖民主义的剥削制度和在社会主义世界复辟资本主义的得力帮凶。目前，由于苏联领导所执行的大国沙文主义政策，经济压力和对内政的肆无忌惮的干涉，结果，在修正主义阵线内部，正在土崩瓦解，一片混乱，民族主义的争端层出不穷，互相对立，争风吃醋等等。随着为西方资本的经济、文化和政治渗透，为美国的生活方式的渗入大开其门，这种分崩离析的过程越来越加剧了。指挥棒摔成了一百段，而每个修正主义集团还是走他们的老路。
    但是，尽管帝修阵营遭到惨重的失败，尽管敌人被世界各国人民所孤立，所包围，他们并没有放弃反对各国人民争取自由和独立的阴谋，并没有放弃夺取各国人民的革命胜利果实和压迫、奴役各国人民的挣扎。美国帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导，正象柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗的会见所表明的一样，正在变本加厉地来执行美苏合作霸占世界和划分势力范围的共同黄粱美梦。它们正在阴谋策划扑灭亚非拉各国人民解放运动，特别是要镇压和奴役英雄越南人民。
    现在美帝、苏修正在竭力地把各种反动势力纠集在一起，以便共同组织反革命反华的“神圣同盟”和组成对人民中国的包围圈。在苏美联合镇压越南人民的解放战争，并使帝国主义在这个国家的奴役能永久化的企图中，能更好地看出苏美合作。在美国把军事侵略日益升级的时候，苏联修正主义者无所不用其极地来破坏越南人民的斗争，并企图迫使他们同侵略者坐在谈判桌边上来。但是，帝国主义者和修正主义者的一切企图都破产了，并还将遭到破产，因为越南人民决心不论为自己正义事业的胜利将会遭受多大的痛苦，作出多大的牺牲，他们必将坚持斗争到最后胜利。
    苏联修正主义者正象在越南一样，来反对阿拉伯人民，给阿拉伯人民背后一刀，在最困难的时刻把他们置之不顾。这方面，苏联修正主义者成了美帝国主义的帮凶，背信弃义的叛徒。他们为了两大国主宰世界，准备廉价出卖别国人民的利益，在任何时候都准备牺牲别国人民的自由。
    所有这一切说明，美帝和苏修成了两股危险的反动势力，各国人民必须对他们不断提高革命警惕，因为要胜利地反对帝国主义，必须以同样的力量和同样的决心反对修正主义。
    我们两党、两国人民在毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，英勇地反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民，中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，毫无保留地支持各国人民的革命斗争和兄弟的越南人民的斗争。兄弟的越南人民的斗争必将战胜美国侵略者和粉碎修正主义的阴谋诡计。中阿两国人民、两党全力支持阿拉伯人民反对美帝以色列侵略的斗争，全力支持亚、非、拉各国人民的解放和革命斗争。这个斗争给帝、修、反在这些大陆上的地位以震撼性的打击。中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，我们两国人民团结一致，将永远高高举起马克思列宁主义无往而不胜的旗帜，永远高高举起革命的旗帜，永远高高举起毫不妥协的反帝、反修的旗帜。
    对世界一切革命者来说，今年是过大节的一年，是十月社会主义革命五十周年的一年。对于革命者和马克思列宁主义者来说，更美好的，更壮观的节日就是各国人民积极投入革命，投入为伟大共产主义事业而进行的斗争。在革命五十周年里让我们更高地举起列宁主义的旗帜，加强我们和一切真正为共产主义事业而斗争的战士的团结，加强反对各国人民的头号敌人——帝国主义的斗争，加强反对伟大十月思想和列宁、斯大林学说的叛徒的斗争，加强反对苏修领导集团、铁托集团和其他修正主义者的斗争。十月革命的思想是战斗的号召，是行动号召。一切真正的共产党员，一切革命者应该投入战斗，投入打倒叛徒的行动。一切革命者，不管在什么地方，都应该团结起来，断绝和修正主义党的联系，消除一切幻想，成立马克思列宁主义政党，组织无情的革命斗争。
    亲爱的同志们：
    我国位于被帝国主义和修正主义所统治着的欧洲，但是，她从来不感到自己孤立，不感到远离世界上的许许多多的朋友，首先是七亿中国人民，我国同七亿中国人民结成了牢不可破的友谊。这种友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义原则基础上的，是我们两党和两个领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志所缔造的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民非常珍惜这种伟大的友谊，并为有象兄弟的中国人民这样忠诚和强大的战友而感到自豪。阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民战斗在反对共同敌人帝国主义和修正主义的同一个行列。这种友谊对阿尔巴尼亚人民来说，是巨大的革命的鼓舞，是在阿尔巴尼亚建设社会主义和国防的有力支持。我国人民决心不断地发展和加强阿中友谊，深信这种友谊不仅符合我们两国人民的利益，而且，也符合全世界人民的伟大革命事业，社会主义事业和解放事业的利益。
    没有，也永远不会有任何力量能够损害阿中两国人民、两党之间的战斗友谊的一根毫毛。毛泽东同志在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的有历史意义的贺电中说：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”不管在我们向社会主义前进的共同道路上出现什么艰难险阻，不管出现什么风暴，我们两国人民，在他们马克思列宁主义的党的领导下，将永远高举他们友谊的旗帜，兄弟般地互相帮助、互相支持，将向正在等待着我们的伟大的革命战役，而大无畏地进军。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖，阿尔巴尼亚人民最敬爱的朋友毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    向太原和山西省革命群众致兄弟的、热烈的敬礼！
    光荣属于马克思列宁主义！
