	American people have launched a new wave of protests against the Vietnam War and conscription in dozens of cities from the West Coast to the East Coast in recent days. Tens of thousands of young people have taken to the streets, holding demonstrations, surrounding conscription centers, and thousands of young people have publicly burned and torn up their draft cards.

	In San Francisco, over 800 young people have been surrounding the Oakland Induction Center near San Francisco since the morning of the 16th, blocking the entrance to the conscription center. They distributed leaflets opposing the Vietnam War and chanted slogans such as "No, we won't go (to Vietnam)," "Give me freedom now." The demonstrators, undeterred by the brutal repression and arrests by the reactionary authorities, held an all-night mass meeting at the University of California with over 6,000 participants. On the morning of the 17th, a demonstration of over 4,000 people, holding "Oppose Conscription" banners, continued to surround and block the Oakland Induction Center. The demonstrators, facing police tear gas, engaged in fierce struggles with over 400 police officers, who were equipped with helmets and batons, sent to suppress them.

	In Boston, over 5,000 young people held a mass meeting in a public square on the 16th and staged a large-scale demonstration against the Vietnam War. About 300 young people burned or returned their draft cards on the spot. The demonstrators also publicly announced their goal: to "stop the draft and military activities until U.S. troops withdraw from Vietnam."

	In New York, approximately 1,200 demonstrators held a rally in front of City Hall on the 16th to protest conscription and the Vietnam War. During the rally, hundreds of young people tore up their draft cards and each placed a letter declaring their opposition to the government's Vietnam War policy in a box, intended for the Johnson administration. The demonstrators also blocked a conscription center in New York City and the financial district of Wall Street, where American monopolistic capitalists congregate. On the 16th and 17th, demonstrations of varying scales against the Vietnam War also erupted in several dozen major cities across the United States, including Chicago, Washington, Seattle, and Los Angeles.
