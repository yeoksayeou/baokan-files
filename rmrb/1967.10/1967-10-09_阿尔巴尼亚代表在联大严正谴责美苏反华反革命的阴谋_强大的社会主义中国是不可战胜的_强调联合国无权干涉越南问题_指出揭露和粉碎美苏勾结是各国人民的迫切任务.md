Albanian Representative Strongly Condemns US-Soviet Anti-China Counter-Revolutionary Conspiracy at the UN
Powerful Socialist China is Invincible
Emphasizes that the UN has No Right to Interfere in the Vietnamese Issue
Points Out that Exposing and Smashing the US-Soviet Collusion is an Urgent Task for the People of All Countries

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the Albanian News Agency reported: The head of the Albanian delegation to the 22nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, Halim Budo, spoke at the plenary meeting on September 29. He sternly condemned the collaboration between U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership in using the United Nations to plot the expansion of the war in Vietnam, oppress the Arab peoples, and fiercely oppose China in various conspiracies.

In his speech, the Albanian representative strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' collaboration with the Soviet revisionist leadership in their frenzied anti-China activities. He pointed out that all their conspiracies and slanders are doomed to fail. He emphasized that the People's Republic of China is a powerful socialist country. "The glorious victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is another testament to the invincible power of the great Chinese people, a strong guarantee that the great Chinese people will continue to advance in great strides. The Cultural Revolution has dashed the last hopes of the imperialists and revisionists to re-subjugate China to the shackles of capitalism and colonialism."

Halim Budo pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the center of world reactionary forces and the vicious enemy of the peoples of all countries. To realize its aggressive ambitions, the United States is strengthening its collusion with the Soviet revisionist leaders. He pointed out that the Johnson-Kosygin talks in Glassboro "marked a new stage in the 'holy alliance' between imperialism and revisionism."

Budo, in discussing the Vietnamese issue, strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for acting as accomplices to U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. He reaffirmed that the Albanian people and government firmly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and fully support the four just demands of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, believing that this is the only correct way to resolve the Vietnamese issue. He sternly pointed out: "The United Nations Organization has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Vietnam. The internal affairs of Vietnam belong to the Vietnamese people and only to the Vietnamese people."

Budo also, on behalf of the Albanian government and people, expressed resolute support for the just struggles of the Arab peoples and states. Budo called on all member states that cherish freedom and the principles of international security to oppose the deceptive so-called "non-proliferation treaty." Budo also pointed out: Under the control and manipulation of the United States and the Soviet Union, the United Nations "has become a tool of deception and a trading center for selling the interests of the people, a means to cover up the policies of imperialist aggression and oppression of the peoples of various countries, and a tool for imposing pressure, interference, and aggression on free-loving peoples and states."

He then emphasized that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored. He said that the great People's China's seat in the United Nations has been usurped by a traitorous clique that has long been spit upon by the Chinese people, which is unacceptable.

Budo also enthusiastically praised socialist China for its "unstoppable revolutionary momentum in achieving development and progress in all areas, making it a great power with high authority and prestige in the world." He said, "China has consistently and unremittingly pursued a policy of peace and friendship among all peoples, firmly opposed the aggressive and war policies of imperialism and international reactionaries, and unreservedly maintained and supported the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of all countries for freedom, national independence, and social progress."

He also pointed out that the Chinese people have developed their own nuclear weapons, "which has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving countries and peoples, believing it to be a great factor for peace and international security."

Budo finally called on the governments and peoples of all peace-loving countries to be vigilant against the great conspiracy of the United States and the Soviet Union to collude against the peace-loving countries of the world, against the free-loving peoples and national liberation movements. He emphasized that "in the current world situation, exposing and smashing the collusion of these two superpowers has become an extremely urgent and necessary task for all peoples and countries that love freedom and peace."

    阿尔巴尼亚代表在联大严正谴责美苏反华反革命的阴谋
    强大的社会主义中国是不可战胜的
    强调联合国无权干涉越南问题　指出揭露和粉碎美苏勾结是各国人民的迫切任务
    据新华社讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：出席第二十二届联合国大会的阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长哈利姆·布多，九月二十九日在联大全体会议上发言，严正谴责美帝国主义和苏修领导集团勾结在一起，利用联合国策划扩大侵越战争、欺压阿拉伯各国人民和疯狂反对中国的种种阴谋。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表在发言中强烈谴责美帝国主义伙同苏修领导集团疯狂反华。他指出，它们的一切阴谋和诽谤是注定要失败的。他强调指出：中华人民共和国是一个强大的社会主义国家。“中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利是伟大的中国人民的不可战胜的力量的又一例证，是伟大的中国人民将始终大踏步前进的坚强保证，无产阶级文化大革命使帝国主义者和修正主义者企图重新置中国于资本主义和殖民主义枷锁之下的最后希望破灭了。”
    哈利姆·布多指出，美帝国主义是世界反动势力的中心，是各国人民凶恶的敌人。为了实现它的侵略野心，美国正在加强它同苏联修正主义领导人的勾结。他指出，约翰逊—柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的会谈，“标志着帝国主义—修正主义之间‘神圣同盟’的新阶段”。
    布多在谈到越南问题时强烈谴责苏修领导集团充当美帝侵越的帮凶。重申阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争，完全支持越南民主共和国政府的四项正义主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，认为这是解决越南问题的唯一正确的道路。他严正指出：“联合国组织没有任何权利来干涉越南的内部事务。越南的内部事务是属于越南人民的，只属于越南人民。”
    布多在发言中还代表阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民表示，坚决支持阿拉伯人民和国家的正义斗争。布多号召所有珍视自由和国际安全原则的会员国反对欺骗性的所谓“不扩散核武器条约”。布多还指出：在美苏的控制和操纵下，联合国“已经变成一个欺骗的工具和出卖人民利益的交易中心，变成掩盖帝国主义侵略和压迫各国人民的政策的手段，变成对爱好自由的人民和国家施加压力、进行干涉和侵略的工具”。
    他接着强调指出：应该恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。他说，伟大的人民中国在联合国的席位被一个早已为中国人民唾弃的卖国集团霸占着，这是不能容忍的。
    布多还热情赞扬社会主义中国“以不可阻挡的革命动力在各方面取得发展和进步，是一个具有很高的权威和威望的世界大国”，“中国坚持不懈地奉行和平与各国人民互相友好的政策，坚决反对帝国主义和国际反动派的侵略和战争政策，毫无保留地维护和支持各国人民争取自由、民族独立和社会进步的反帝斗争”。
    他还指出，中国人民已经发展了自己的核武器，“这件事情受到爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢呼，认为这是和平与国际安全的巨大因素”。
    布多最后呼吁爱好和平的各国政府和人民，警惕美帝、苏修加紧勾结反对世界爱好和平的国家、反对世界上爱好自由的人民和民族解放运动的大阴谋。他强调指出：“在当前的世界形势下，揭露和粉碎这两大国的勾结，已经成为一切爱好自由与爱好和平的人民和国家的十分必要的迫切任务。”
