Our great leader Chairman Mao has recently issued a great call to arms to the workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals across the nation: to struggle against selfishness and criticize and repudiate revisionism.

Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, conveyed Chairman Mao's latest directive at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Struggling against selfishness means waging a struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the 'selfish' character in one's own mind. Criticizing and repudiating revisionism means using Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose revisionism and to struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These two tasks are interrelated. Only by thoroughly struggling against selfishness can we carry the struggle against revisionism to the end."

"Criticize and repudiate revisionism, struggle against selfishness" is a profound and scientific summary of the basic content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the basic content of criticizing the bourgeoisie throughout the entire socialist historical period. It is the fundamental policy to ensure the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, to prevent capitalist restoration, to strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to turn the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletariat can seize political power from the bourgeoisie in a relatively short period. Overthrowing the system of ownership of the exploiting classes does not take much time either. However, to eliminate the old ideological system left over from the exploiting classes for thousands of years and to remold people's souls with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, will take a very, very long time.

Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought has always held that ideas come from matter. Social consciousness comes from social existence, from the economic base and the system of ownership of society. People's social existence determines people's thoughts. However, thoughts, in turn, play a huge active role in the development of society's politics and economy, and under certain conditions, play a decisive role. Old ideas that reflect the demands of the exploiting classes serve the old economic base and hinder the development of society. New ideas that reflect the demands of the advanced classes serve the new economic base and promote and accelerate the development of society. Once advanced ideas are grasped by the masses, they will become a powerful material force driving social development. Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize old ideas and establish new ones.

Where do the old ideas of the exploiting classes lie? The most essential point is that they lie in the character of "selfishness," that is, viewing the world from the standpoint of oneself, of "selfishness." The selfishness of the exploiting classes is the natural soil for the growth of capitalism, a major factor in the production of revisionism, and a thought poison that undermines socialist public ownership and subverts the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Revisionism is the most concentrated and most stubborn defender of the old ideological system of the bourgeoisie within the working class. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, hidden within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, are some revisionists who, while wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, actually attempt to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

This shows that to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent capitalist restoration, we must launch a great political and ideological revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is to overthrow revisionism, to overthrow all old ideas, to remold people's souls, and to achieve the revolutionization of people's thoughts. Therefore, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must "criticize and repudiate revisionism, struggle against selfishness."

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. To carry this great revolution to the end, we must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, mobilize hundreds of millions of people, and with Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, carry out a broader and deeper revolutionary criticism. We must, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, criticize and repudiate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with Liu Shaoqi as their chief. In the revolutionary criticism, we must, in conjunction with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our own units, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolutionaries and the three-in-one combination, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism in all aspects. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we must also use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome anarchism, factionalism, sectarianism, individualism, and pragmatism within our ranks, and sweep away all non-proletarian thoughts that hinder the completion of political tasks.

Each of us revolutionaries, each revolutionary comrade, must both regard ourselves as a force for the revolution and regard ourselves as the object of the revolution; both be a vanguard in criticizing revisionism and a pioneer in struggling against selfishness. If we do not struggle against selfishness and do not revolutionize ourselves, then we cannot effectively criticize revisionism, and we may even be deceived by revisionist ideas and fall into the revisionist quagmire. Similarly, only by actively engaging in the struggle against revisionism can we deeply touch the soul and thoroughly struggle against selfishness.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take 'criticize and repudiate revisionism, struggle against selfishness' as our guideline, and strengthen the ideological education of military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. We must establish various study classes, centrally, locally, and by various revolutionary mass organizations, and turn the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought."

Establishing study classes, educating cadres, and educating the masses, the most important thing is to, with the various problems and active thoughts in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, diligently and seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, use the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," rely on the masses to educate themselves. For our own shortcomings and errors, we must mainly adopt the method of self-criticism, criticize and repudiate selfishness, summarize experiences, accept lessons, and correct them. Through study, we must raise the ideological and political level of our old cadres, new cadres, and revolutionary youngsters, achieve new unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and in "criticize and repudiate revisionism, struggle against selfishness," achieve new merits for the people.

### “斗私，批修”是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针

    “斗私，批修”是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，最近向全国的工人、农民、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命的知识分子，发出了伟大的战斗号召：要斗私，批修。
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上，传达了毛主席的这个最新指示。林彪同志指出：“斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的‘私’字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”
      “斗私，批修”，很精辟、很科学地概括了无产阶级文化大革命的基本内容，概括了整个社会主义历史时期“批判资产阶级”的基本内容。它是保证我国无产阶级文化大革命取得全面彻底胜利的根本方针，是防止资本主义复辟、加强和巩固无产阶级专政、把全国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的根本方针。
    无产阶级从资产阶级手里夺取政权，可以在比较短的时间内完成。推翻剥削阶级的所有制，时间也不需要很长。但是，要消灭剥削阶级几千年遗留下来的旧的思想体系，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想改造人们的灵魂，却需要很长很长的时间。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想一贯认为，思想是从物质来的。社会意识是从社会的存在来的，从社会的经济基础、社会的占有制度来的。人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。但是，思想，反转来，对社会政治经济的发展起巨大的能动作用，在一定条件下，起决定的作用。反映剥削阶级要求的旧思想，是为旧的经济基础服务的，对社会的发展起着阻碍作用。反映先进阶级要求的新思想，是为新的经济基础服务的，对社会的发展起促进、加速的作用。先进的思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成推动社会发展的强大的物质力量。所以，我们必须大破旧思想，大立新思想。
    剥削阶级的旧思想旧在哪里？最本质的，是旧在一个“私”字上，就是从为自己、为“私”的观点来看世界。剥削阶级的利己主义，是滋长资本主义的天然土壤，是产生修正主义的重大因素，是瓦解社会主义公有经济和颠覆无产阶级专政的思想毒菌。
    修正主义，是资产阶级旧的思想体系在工人阶级内部最集中的代表者和最顽固的维护者。隐藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是一些披着马克思列宁主义外衣，而实际上企图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的修正主义分子。
    这就说明，要巩固和加强无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，就必须开展政治思想的大革命。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是革修正主义的命，革一切旧思想的命，就是改造人的灵魂，就是要实现人的思想革命化。因此，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要“斗私，批修”。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。为了把这场大革命进行到底，就必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发动亿万群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，更广泛、更深刻地开展革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，在革命的大批判中，结合本单位的斗批改，巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的三结合，彻底肃清在各个方面的修正主义流毒。为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，还必须用毛泽东思想克服我们队伍中的无政府主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、个人主义和实用主义，扫除妨碍政治斗争任务完成的各种非无产阶级思想。
    我们每一个无产阶级革命派，每一个革命同志，既要把自己当作革命的一份动力，又应当把自己看作革命的对象；既要做批修的先锋，又要做斗私的闯将。如果不斗私，不革自己的命，那么，批修也是搞不好的，而且可能会被修正主义的东西所蒙蔽，甚至跌入修正主义的泥坑。同样，也只有积极地投入批修的战斗，才能深刻地触及灵魂，狠狠地斗私。
    林彪同志指出：“我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，用‘斗私，批修’这四个字为纲，加强对军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。”
    开办学习班，教育干部，教育群众，头等重要的事，是要带着无产阶级文化大革命中的各种问题、各种活思想，刻苦地、认真地活学活用毛主席著作。要根据毛主席历来的教导，运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，依靠群众自己教育自己。对自己的缺点错误，主要采取自我批评的方法，破私立公，总结经验，接受教训，加以改正。通过学习，使我们的老干部、新干部和革命小将，提高思想政治水平，在毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的基础上达到新的团结，在“斗私，批修”中为人民立新功。
