The Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique, driven by the urgent needs of counter-revolution, is vigorously promoting writers and works that were criticized during Stalin's leadership of the Soviet Union for their vicious attacks on socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are going to great lengths to rehabilitate demons and snakes in the literary realm.

In 1946, the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued a resolution, severely criticizing the reactionary writers Zoshchenko and Akhmatova and their works, and sternly condemning the magazines that provided platforms for them. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that Zoshchenko was a "literary scoundrel and dregs." His works were "specifically designed to promote rotten, thoughtless, vulgar, and apolitical speech, aiming to lead our youth astray and poison their minds." Akhmatova's poetry was "filled with pessimism and decadent thoughts, revealing the taste of old salon poetry formed on the position of bourgeois aristocratic aestheticism and decadence—'art for art's sake'—which did not want to march forward with the people," and it "harmed the cause of educating our youth, and thus was intolerable in Soviet literature."

However, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique openly restored the reputation of these two reactionary writers who were spat upon by the Soviet people in the 1940s, erecting monuments and biographies for them. They dug up these stinking piles of garbage from the historical trash heap to serve themselves, re-publishing their works. In an article in October 1965, the Soviet *Literaturnaya Gazeta* shouted that Zoshchenko was "one of the founders of Soviet humor and satirical literature." It also said, "Zoshchenko's masterpieces are still effective today." Last March, when Akhmatova died, the Soviet revisionist poet Tvardovsky published a memorial article in *Izvestia*, slandering the past criticisms against her as "unfair and brutal attacks," and shamelessly praising her poetry as an "indispensable part of Soviet national poetic culture, a living branch in the great Russian poetic garden."

The Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique not only blatantly decided to publish the traitorous writer Pasternak's reactionary novel *Doctor Zhivago*, which fiercely attacks the October Revolution, but also published the memoirs and poetry collections of this counter-revolutionary. The Soviet revisionist poet Yevtushenko, in his speech in Australia, openly rehabilitated him, saying that *Doctor Zhivago* "in no way can be considered an anti-Soviet novel." The Soviet revisionist clique even went so far as to add a 22-page preface and a 25-page postscript to this traitor's poetry collection, praising this traitor of the Soviet people as an "outstanding artist" and the "most talented creator," and publishing memoirs describing his supposed "tragic fate," using the traitor's mouth to slander socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Reactionary works that were once condemned by the Soviet people are now being revived under the patronage of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The reactionary Russian writer Andreyev, who fled abroad after the October Revolution, and his play *Our Days*, the play *The Storm*, which was banned in the 1940s for its vicious attacks on the purges, are now being performed on stage. Shostakovich's yellow opera *Katerina Izmailova*, which was criticized and banned in the 1930s, not only returned to the stage but was also made into a large-scale color wide-screen film to be shown abroad, earning the praise of the mouthpiece of American monopoly capitalism, *The New York Times*. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique was overjoyed and greatly publicized this, taking pride in it.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's rehabilitation of these elements is to mobilize all demons and snakes and social dregs to more fiercely attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, serving their counter-revolutionary restoration. The scoundrel Shcherbiakova, who was sentenced to imprisonment during Stalin's leadership of the Soviet Union, immediately jumped out after the Soviet revisionist ruling clique rehabilitated her, writing novels to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and Stalin. This scoundrel was particularly favored by the revisionist leader Khrushchev. Khrushchev praised her for "creating" works needed by the Soviet revisionist clique "after her rehabilitation."

### 牛鬼蛇神充斥苏联文艺领域  苏修集团大量重新出版和上演反动文艺作品

    牛鬼蛇神充斥苏联文艺领域
    苏修集团大量重新出版和上演反动文艺作品
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团出于反革命的迫切需要，竭力吹捧在斯大林领导苏联期间受过批判的恶毒攻击社会主义和无产阶级专政的反动作家和作品，在文艺领域内变本加厉地为牛鬼蛇神翻案。
    一九四六年，联共（布）中央委员会曾作出决议，痛斥反动文人左琴科和阿赫玛托娃及其作品，并严厉批评为他们提供放毒场所的杂志。联共（布）中央的决议指出，左琴科是个“文学无赖与渣滓”。左琴科的作品是“专门宣扬腐烂的、缺乏思想性的、庸俗的、缺乏政治性的言论，想使我们的青年走入歧途并毒化他们的意识”。阿赫玛托娃的诗“充满着悲观主义和颓废思想，显露出那种在资产阶级贵族的唯美主义与颓废主义——‘为艺术而艺术’——的立场上形成的、不愿和自己人民齐步前进的旧沙龙诗歌的趣味”，“对教育我们青年的事业带来损害，因而在苏维埃文学中是难以容忍的”。
    但是，苏修统治集团却公然为在四十年代就被苏联人民所唾弃的这两个反动作家恢复名誉，树碑立传。他们把这些早已被扫入历史垃圾堆的臭狗屎搬出来为自己服务，重新出版了他们的著作。苏联《文学报》在一九六五年十月的一篇文章中叫嚷，左琴科是“苏联幽默和讽刺文学创始者之一”。它还说，“左琴科的杰作在今天仍然是起作用的力量”。去年三月，当阿赫玛托娃死去时，苏修反动诗人特瓦尔朵夫斯基在《消息报》上发表纪念文章，污蔑过去对她的批评是“极不公平的、粗暴的攻击”，并无耻吹捧她的诗是苏联
  “民族诗歌文化中不可分割的一部分，是伟大俄罗斯诗园中的一株有生命力的新枝”。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团不仅明目张胆决定出版叛徒作家帕斯捷尔纳克猖狂攻击十月革命的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》，而且出版了这个反革命分子的回忆录和诗集。苏修反动诗人叶夫图申科在澳大利亚的讲话，公然为他翻案，说什么《日瓦戈医生》“无论如何不能被认为是反苏小说”。苏修集团甚至不惜在这个叛徒的诗集前面加了一个长达二十二页的前言和长达二十五页的跋，把这个苏联人民的叛徒吹捧为“一个卓越的艺术家”、“最天才的创作者”，还发表了叙述他所谓的“悲惨遭遇”的回忆录，借叛徒之口，来大肆污蔑社会主义和无产阶级专政。
    过去受到苏联人民谴责的反革命作品，在苏修统治集团的扶植下，纷纷出笼。俄国反动作家，十月革命后一直流窜在国外的白俄分子安德列耶夫的剧本《我们生活的数日》，四十年代刚出笼即被禁演的、猖狂攻击肃反的话剧《暴风雪》，也被搬上了舞台。三十年代受批判被禁演的萧斯塔科维奇的黄色歌剧《卡捷琳娜·伊兹玛洛娃》，不仅重登舞台，而且被摄制成大型彩色宽银幕电影拿到外国去放映，博得了美国垄断资产阶级的喉舌《纽约时报》的赞赏，苏修统治集团受宠若惊，并大肆宣传，以此为荣。
    苏修统治集团为这些家伙翻案，就是要调动一切牛鬼蛇神和社会渣滓更猖狂地攻击无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，为他们的反革命复辟服务。在斯大林领导苏联时期被判处徒刑的坏蛋谢列布里亚科娃，在苏修统治集团替她翻案后，立即跳出来，写小说攻击无产阶级专政和斯大林。这个坏蛋得到了修正主义头子赫鲁晓夫的特别赏识。赫鲁晓夫赞扬她在“恢复名誉之后”，立即“创作着”苏修集团“所需要的作品”。　（据新华社讯）
