The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage war, and only by relying on the people can we wage war." This is an absolutely true great truth. In May 1947, the people of the Yimeng Mountains and tens of thousands of people from various places who came to support the frontlines, together with our children's army, annihilated the Kuomintang's "elite" 74th Division, fully demonstrating the tremendous power of the people's war.

At that time, I was the village militia captain. During the Menglianggu Battle, we militia delivered ammunition, transported grain, and participated in the battle to ambush the enemy. After the battle ended, we immediately cooperated with the troops to capture prisoners and clean up the battlefield, always fighting alongside the main forces and celebrating victories together. At that time, in the Menglianggu area, every village was a battlefield, and everyone was a soldier. Everywhere, men, women, old, and young enthusiastically supported the troops in battle, creating moving scenes. Women worked day and night to cook water, make meals, and make military boots for the children's army. The elderly personally fed the wounded one mouthful at a time, and some even risked their lives to deliver intelligence to the children's army. After the battle began, when the children's army attacked the foot of Menglianggu Mountain, a local guide was needed, but all the men in the village had gone out to fight. A woman in her fifties volunteered, saying, "I'll go! I can definitely lead the way." Indeed, this old woman led the children's army to the top of the mountain. Later, on this mountain, our heroic troops annihilated the Kuomintang's "elite" 74th Division and killed the false division commander Zhang Lingfu.

However, in the reactionary film "Red Sun," there is not the slightest trace of the people supporting the children's army. We must question the film's directors: Why do you distort the historical fact of our people supporting the revolutionary war? Why do you defame our army as a disorganized mob detached from the people? You blatantly sever the flesh-and-blood connection between the people's army and the masses, crazily opposing Chairman Mao's people's war ideology, and preparing public opinion for your master, the Chinese Khrushchev, to seize the party, seize power, and seize the military. This is a futile attempt and will never succeed!

"Soldiers love the people, the people support the soldiers; soldiers and people are as close as one family; soldiers and people united have great strength; together we can defeat the enemy." This was a folk song that circulated in our area during the war years. The people of the Yimeng Mountains have a blood-and-flesh relationship with the children's army. However, in the film, the directors not only fail to reflect the people supporting the war but also maliciously incite the children's army against the people. The film depicts that before the troops wait for orders to depart and execute combat missions, an old farmer says to the soldiers who came to work, "You are all good craftsmen and have helped us a lot. If you could help us harvest the autumn crops, that would be great." But the platoon leader, Shi Donggen, upon hearing this, becomes very impatient and says, "Are we going to settle here, good or bad!" The directors distort the revolutionary masses into selfish and backward individuals who only care about their own interests, not only failing to support the military in battle but also preventing the children's army from annihilating the enemy. They also slander the people's soldiers as being indifferent to the people's interests. They defame and slander the children's army and the people, inciting military-civilian relations. Their intentions are extremely malicious!

The unity of soldiers and civilians is like one person; see who can defeat us! The people of the Yimeng Mountains resolutely will not allow the directors of the reactionary film "Red Sun" and their backers, the Chinese Khrushchevs, to destroy our unbreakable military-civilian unity. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, respond to Chairman Mao's great call, launch the "Support the Army, Love the People" movement, and let all enemies smash their heads and bleed in front of our great wall!

    绝不允许反对人民战争
    山东沂南县孟良崮公社南瓦庄大队老民兵队长  李志营
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”这是千真万确的伟大真理。一九四七年五月，我们沂蒙山区人民和各地来支前的数十万群众，配合和支援子弟兵消灭了蒋匪“王牌”七十四师，充分显示了人民战争的巨大威力。
    当时我是村里的民兵队长。在孟良崮战役中，我们民兵送弹药、运粮草，参加狙击敌人的战斗，战役结束后又立即配合部队捉俘虏、打扫战场，一直和主力部队战斗在一起，胜利在一起。当时我们孟良崮一带地方，村村是战场，人人是战士，到处出现男女老幼欢欣鼓舞地支援部队作战的动人情景。妇女们白天黑夜不停地给子弟兵烧水、做饭、做军鞋。老年人亲自一口一口地给伤员喂饭，有的还冒着生命的危险，给子弟兵送情报。战斗打响以后，当子弟兵攻到孟良崮山下时，需要一个当地人带路，村里的男人都出去参加战斗了，一个五十多岁的老大娘就自告奋勇地说：“我去！我一定能带到。”果然，这位老大娘带着子弟兵到达了大崮顶山。后来就在这座山上，我们英雄的部队消灭了蒋匪“王牌”七十四师，并且打死了伪师长张灵甫。
    但是，在反动影片《红日》里，丝毫看不到人民群众支援子弟兵的伟大场面。我们要责问影片的编导者，你们为什么抹煞我们人民群众支援革命战争的历史事实？为什么把我军污蔑成脱离群众的乌合之众？你们明目张胆地割断了人民军队和群众的血肉联系，疯狂地反对毛主席的人民战争思想，来为你们的主子中国赫鲁晓夫篡党、篡政、篡军作舆论准备，这是痴心妄想，永远办不到！
      “军爱民，民拥军，军民亲如一家人，军民团结力量大，齐心协力打敌人。”这是在战争年代我们这里流传的一首歌谣。我们沂蒙山区人民，与子弟兵有着血肉相联、鱼水不分的关系。但在影片里，编导者不仅不反映人民群众支援战争，反而还恶毒地挑拨子弟兵与人民群众的关系。影片描写在部队待命出发去执行战斗任务前，老农对来劳动的解放军说：“你们都是好把式，帮了我们的大忙，要能再帮我们收大秋，那该多好。”而连长石东根一听，很不耐烦地说：“我们在这里落户，好不好！”编导者把革命群众歪曲成自私落后，只顾自己利益，不但不支援军队打仗，并且还不让子弟兵去消灭敌人的群氓；又把人民战士诬蔑成对人民利益毫不关心的糊涂虫。他们丑化和诬蔑子弟兵和人民群众，挑拨军民关系，用心真是恶毒之极！
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？我们沂蒙山区人民，坚决不许反动影片《红日》的编导者和他们的后台中国赫鲁晓夫之流破坏我们牢不可破的军民团结。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，响应毛主席的伟大号召，开展“拥军爱民”运动，让一切敌人在我们的伟大长城面前碰得头破血流！
