The leaders of the Tokyo Chinese Association and the Kyoto Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) have separately issued statements protesting the use of the traitor Dalai Lama by the reactionary forces of the United States, Japan, and India to engage in anti-China activities.

	Tokyo, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) — On the morning of September 28, six leaders of the Tokyo Chinese Association, including Chairman Gan Wenfang and Vice Chairman Wu Pufen, visited the "Yomiuri Shimbun" in a highly indignant mood to strongly protest its actions in following the instructions of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to "invite" the Dalai Lama, the head of the Tibetan rebels who fled to India, to Japan to engage in anti-China activities.

	The Tokyo Chinese Association's statement of protest pointed out that the Sato government of Japan, following the lead of the U.S. imperialists, colluding with the Soviet revisionists, is increasingly openly pursuing a policy of hostility towards China. This time, it brought the Dalai Lama, who is despised by the Chinese people and is a puppet of the Indian reactionaries, to Japan to engage in criminal activities. This is a further criminal act of destroying the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, following the visit of Japanese Prime Minister Sato to Taiwan. It is a serious provocation to the Chinese people.

	The statement pointed out that at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is achieving decisive victories, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries, who are terrified of the great thought of Mao Zedong, are collaborating to engage in a hysterical anti-China chorus. In this situation, the Sato government, in collusion with the revisionist group led by Maruyama of the Japanese Communist Party, after unreasonably refusing the entry of the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association, conspired with the Indian reactionaries through the "Japanese Buddhist Missionary Association" to bring the traitor Dalai Lama to Japan. Furthermore, the "Yomiuri Shimbun" took the lead in organizing the so-called "Tibet Treasure Exhibition" to brazenly engage in anti-China propaganda. This fully exposes the Sato government's role as the vanguard in the current international anti-China tide.

	The statement pointed out that the Sato government's tool, the "Yomiuri Shimbun," actually hung a map in the exhibition hall of the "Tibet Treasure Exhibition" it organized, which deliberately excludes Tibet from the map of China. The small booklet edited and published by the "Yomiuri Shimbun" contains a letter from the Dalai Lama to the "exhibition," which lists Japan, India, and Tibet as "three countries." It is clear that this is a major criminal act by the "Yomiuri Shimbun," following the instructions of the Sato government, to participate in the conspiracy of the reactionary forces led by U.S. imperialism to separate Tibet, a sacred territory of China, from China.

	The statement finally said that no matter what "reasons" the Sato government and the "Yomiuri Shimbun" use to justify their crimes of hostility towards China and interference in China's internal affairs, they are absolutely unacceptable. We hereby strongly protest to the Japanese government again.

	Tokyo, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, the Kyoto Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) issued a statement on September 27, strongly protesting the new anti-China conspiracy planned by the reactionary forces of the United States, Japan, and India to bring the Tibetan rebel Dalai Lama to Japan. The statement pointed out that the Dalai Lama's visit to Japan, following the visit of Japanese Prime Minister Sato to Taiwan and Southeast Asia, is not a coincidence. It is an action of hostility towards China under the direction of U.S. imperialism.

	The statement called on the people of various strata in Kyoto to take action and resolutely oppose this anti-China crime by the Sato government.

	The traitor Dalai Lama arrived in Kyoto on September 29 and immediately faced strong opposition from active members of the Japan-China friendship movement and local patriotic overseas Chinese. On September 30, when the Dalai Lama, under the "protection" of the Sato government's police, visited Ryoanji Temple and the Western Pure Land Sect, Japanese and overseas Chinese youth held demonstrations and distributed leaflets, exposing the conspiracy behind the Dalai Lama's activities in Japan.

    东京华侨总会领导人和日中友协（正统）京都总部分别发表声明
    抗议美日印反动派利用叛匪达赖搞反华活动
    新华社东京电　东京华侨总会会长甘文芳、副会长吴普文等六人，怀着十分愤慨的心情，在九月二十八日上午到“读卖新闻社”强烈抗议它秉承美日反动派的意旨，“邀请”逃到印度的中国西藏叛匪头目达赖到日本进行反华活动。
    东京华侨总会的抗议声明指出，日本佐藤政府追随美帝，勾结苏修，越来越露骨地推行敌视中国的政策。这次把被中国人民唾弃的、印度反动派的反华僵尸达赖拉到日本进行罪恶活动，是继日本首相佐藤“访问”台湾之后，进一步破坏中日两国人民友好的犯罪行为，是对中国人民的严重挑衅。
    声明指出，正当我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时候，对伟大的毛泽东思想怕得要死的美帝、苏修和各国反动派串通一起，进行歇斯底里的反华大合唱。在这种情况下，佐藤政府同日共宫本修正主义集团勾结起来，在无理拒绝中日友协访日代表团入境之后，又与印度反动派合谋，通过“日本佛教传道协会”，把中国人民的叛徒达赖拉到日本来，并且由“读卖新闻社”出面举办所谓的“西藏秘宝展览”，放肆地进行反华的宣传活动。这充分暴露了佐藤政府在当前国际上的反华逆流中，充当急先锋的狰狞面目。
    声明指出，佐藤政府的御用工具“读卖新闻社”，竟公然在该社主办的“西藏秘宝展览”会场上，挂出别有用心地把西藏划在中国版图以外的中国地图。“读卖新闻社”编辑出版的小册子，刊登有达赖写给“展览会”的信，竟然把日本、印度和西藏平列，称为“三个国家”。十分明显，这是“读卖新闻社”按照佐藤政府的指使，参予以美帝为首的反动势力妄图把中国神圣领土的西藏从中国分割出去的阴谋活动的重大犯罪行为。
    声明最后说，不管佐藤政府和“读卖新闻社”用什么“理由”为它敌视中国和干涉中国内政的罪行进行辩解，都是绝对不能容许的。我们对此向日本政府再次提出严重抗议。
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日中友好协会（正统）京都总部九月二十七日发表声明，强烈抗议美日印反动派策划中国西藏叛匪达赖“访日”的新的反华阴谋。声明指出，达赖在日本首相佐藤荣作到台湾和东南亚活动的前后来到日本，这绝不是偶然的。它是在美帝国主义指挥棒下的敌视中国的行动。
    声明呼吁京都市各阶层人民行动起来，坚决反对佐藤政府的这一反华罪行。
    叛匪达赖在二十九日从东京到达京都，立即受到从事日中友好运动的积极分子和当地爱国华侨的强烈反对。三十日，当达赖在佐藤政府的警察“保护”下“访问”龙谷大学和西本愿寺时，日本青年和华侨青年举行了示威游行，并散发传单，揭露达赖到日本活动的阴谋。
