In the face of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country, thousands upon thousands of young people are graduating from colleges and universities, embarking on new revolutionary journeys.

Graduates' placement is an important battlefield for schools to fight self and criticize revisionism. In dealing with the issue of graduates' placement, is it the proletarian "public" spirit that overcomes the bourgeois "private" spirit, or is it the bourgeois "private" spirit that dominates? Is it the revolutionary interest that comes first, or is it being trapped in the small circle of individualism and unable to extricate oneself? This is a new and severe test. Therefore, in the process of graduates' placement, all graduates must study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, study the "Three Articles" thoroughly, and resolutely implement the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "fighting self and criticizing revisionism," to achieve new victories in overcoming selfishness and establishing public-mindedness!

To focus on fighting self and criticizing revisionism in graduates' placement, we must thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois ideology of material incentives and the exploitative class's aversion to hard work spread by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We must firmly establish the idea that "work is struggle" and "the more difficult the place, the more we should go there." We must strive for revolution all our lives, determined to go to where the motherland needs us most and where the work is hardest. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time," to be ordinary laborers all our lives, to get covered in mud and oil, and truly cultivate ourselves into "socialist-minded, cultured laborers."

Comrades who are revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in colleges and universities, we hope that you will become pioneers in fighting self and criticizing revisionism, and models of actively obeying state assignments! On the one hand, you should strengthen proletarian revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, overcome liberalism and lack of organization and discipline, and treat graduates' placement with great public spirit; on the other hand, you should assist relevant departments in doing thorough and detailed political and ideological work, organize small group discussions and individual talks, sincerely unite and educate fellow students who were once deceived into joining conservative organizations, and patiently help those who are indifferent to the revolution. In the struggle, solve ideological problems, put the state's interests first, jump out of personal small circles, shoulder the burden of revolution, care about state affairs, correctly handle graduates' placement, and actively obey state assignments.

Graduates, you are familiar with the situation in your schools, and you have the conditions and opportunities to contribute more to the school's struggle, criticism, and reform! We hope that you will make full use of your time in school to focus on the educational revolution, fulfill your responsibilities in resuming classes and making revolution, and create models of educational revolution with other comrades!

Graduates, you have your school's graduation certificates, but you have not yet obtained the graduation certificates from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. You are graduates, but you are far from graduating from the school of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment in the three great revolutionary movements. The task is heavy and the road is long. The responsibility of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution lies on your shoulders. Your graduation only means the beginning of a new revolutionary journey. To become steadfast proletarian revolutionary warriors forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and reliable successors to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary cause, you must forever study and apply Chairman Mao's works, forever fight self and criticize revisionism, forever learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and forever insist on transforming your worldview!

Graduates, follow the revolutionary course opened by our great leader Chairman Mao, and march forward bravely! (October 25)

    毕业分配要狠抓斗私批修
    《文汇报》评论员
    在全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，又有成千上万的青年从大中学校毕业，踏上新的革命征途。
    毕业分配工作，是学校斗私批修的一个重要战场。在对待毕业分配的问题上，是无产阶级的“公”字斗倒资产阶级的“私”字，还是受资产阶级的“私”字支配？是以革命的利益为重，还是陷入个人主义的小圈子中不能自拔？这是一场新的严峻的考验。因此，在毕业分配中，广大毕业生一定要大学大用毛主席著作，大学大用“老三篇”，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席提出的“斗私，批修”的方针，夺取破私立公的新胜利！
    在毕业分配中要狠抓“斗私，批修”，就要彻底破除党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派散播的物质刺激、好逸恶劳的剥削阶级思想，牢牢地树立“工作就是斗争”、“越是困难的地方越是要去”的思想，为革命艰苦奋斗一辈子，立志到祖国最需要、工作最艰苦的地方去。我们要遵照毛主席的教导，“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去”，当一辈子普通劳动者，滚一身泥巴，沾一身油污，真正把自己培养成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    大中学校毕业生中的无产阶级革命派战友们，希望你们成为“斗私，批修”的闯将，成为积极服从国家分配的模范！希望你们一方面加强无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，克服自由主义和无组织无纪律的不良倾向，大公无私地对待毕业分配；另一方面又要协助有关部门做好深入细致的政治思想工作，开展小会谈心和个别谈心活动，诚挚地团结教育曾经受蒙蔽而参加过保守组织的同学，耐心地帮助那些逍遥派同学，在斗争中解决思想问题，以国家利益为重，跳出个人小圈子，挑起革命的重担子，关心国家大事，正确对待毕业分配，积极服从毕业分配。
    毕业生同志们，你们对学校的情况比较了解，你们完全有条件有可能为学校的斗批改作出更多的贡献！希望你们充分利用在校时间安心搞教育革命，对复课闹革命尽到自己应尽的责任，和其他同志一起创造出教育革命的样板来！
    毕业生同志们，你们有了学校的毕业鉴定，但还没有取得工农兵群众给你们的毕业证书。你们是毕业生，但你们远远没有在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动这所学校中毕业。任重而道远。中国革命和世界革命的重任放在你们肩上。你们的毕业，只是意味着新的革命征途的开始。你们要成为永远忠于毛主席的坚定的无产阶级革命战士，成为毛主席所期望的无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人，就应该永远活学活用毛主席著作，永远“斗私，批修”，永远向工农兵群众学习，永远坚持改造世界观！
    毕业生同志们，沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席开辟的革命航道，奋勇前进吧！（十月二十五日）
