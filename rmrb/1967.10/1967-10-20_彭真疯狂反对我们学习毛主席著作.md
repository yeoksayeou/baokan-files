Editor's Note: The head of the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, along with the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, is terrified and hates the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the core. They are afraid that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes will be exposed, and their plot to restore capitalism will be foiled. Therefore, they collude with each other and use every means to sabotage the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Their firm resolve to study Chairman Mao's works is unshakable by any force.

To achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must take "criticizing the private and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry out a deeper revolutionary criticism. We must thoroughly criticize and expose the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplice Peng Zhen, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought among the broad revolutionary masses. Let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shine over all of China and the world!

The anti-revolutionary revisionist element Peng Zhen, like Chinese Khrushchev, is terrified and hates to the core the fact that we workers are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They wield the so-called "simplification, vulgarization, and formalism" stick to resist the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They also create false models and set up false examples to deceive the masses and peddle their black goods. The main members of Peng Zhen's anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, including Liu Ren, personally handle the White Cloud Stone Workshop, mobilizing a large number of people to summarize "experience" and forcibly promote it using the "Municipal Committee Decision" organizational method. They blather on about how "whether or not to study White Cloud Stone is a matter of whether or not politics is prominent, whether or not one's Party nature is pure." What utter nonsense! The White Cloud Stone Workshop is actually a "test field" for Peng Zhen's anti-revolutionary revisionist clique to carry out capitalist restoration. Under the banner of White Cloud Stone, they openly declare: "Not studying the works of Mao can still make one a model workshop," and "Not studying the works of Mao can still make one an advanced individual." They are against our studying Chairman Mao's works.

Peng Zhen rants on about how "studying Mao Zedong Thought, everything is Mao Zedong Thought, writing an article is Mao Zedong Thought, it's easy to become vulgar, and labels are pasted everywhere. Don't let the name be empty, let the name be real, it's okay if there's substance without a name, as long as our cause advances, there's no need to pursue empty fame." The lackeys of Peng Zhen in the White Cloud Stone Workshop echo his words: "Even if one studies the works of Mao very well, if production is not improved, it cannot be considered good!" "I don't study the works of Mao and can still be the secretary of a model workshop branch." Master and servant stink alike.

We workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, reading his books as if we were starving. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we listen to it word for word and carry it out. Especially after studying the "Three Articles," our hearts are warm, we stand taller, we see farther, and we have boundless energy. However, under the suppression of Peng Zhen's anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, the White Cloud Stone Workshop did not organize a single study session of Chairman Mao's works in four years. The broad masses of workers could not bear it any longer and repeatedly demanded that the branch designate someone to take charge of the work of studying Chairman Mao's works. But the lackeys of Peng Zhen in the White Cloud Stone Workshop said: "If you want me to lead the study of the works of Mao, I won't do it!" Since they won't do it, we will organize ourselves to do it. We insist on studying every week, regardless of wind or rain, without interruption. However, Peng Zhen and a handful of capitalist-roaders in our company's Party used the so-called "four freedoms" (voluntary participation, free association, self-determined time, self-selected content) to disband our study groups of Chairman Mao's works. What kind of freedom is this? It is the freedom to oppose the study of Chairman Mao's works, not the freedom to study Chairman Mao's works. They also used the banner of "combining work and rest" to cancel the time for studying Chairman Mao's works; they used overtime, one-stop meetings, and other means to squeeze out our study time. The broad masses of workers are very indignant about this.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Capital Iron and Steel Company's Party do not allow us to study Chairman Mao's works, but they treat Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Zhen as gods. In 1962, when "Cultivation" was reprinted, they eagerly bought it with Party funds, giving a copy to each Party member. During organizational life, they never called for studying Chairman Mao's works, but they called for studying "Cultivation." They also concentrated some Party members and cadres to study for two months, and even the infamous counter-revolutionary manifesto "Editorial of the Frontline" became a required reading.

Now, Peng Zhen's anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, along with their backer Chinese Khrushchev, have been exposed. Chairman Mao teaches us: "If we want the revolution to go all the way, we must use revolutionary methods to thoroughly, completely, and utterly eliminate all reactionary forces." We must take "criticizing the private and criticizing revisionism" as the key link and actively participate in the revolutionary criticism movement to thoroughly overthrow them. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be planted throughout the Capital Iron and Steel Company, throughout China, and throughout the world!

专栏：

   编者按　旧北京市委内反革命修正主义集团头子彭真，同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一样，对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想怕得要死，恨得要命。生怕毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，他们的反党反社会主义的罪行就会暴露，他们的复辟资本主义的阴谋就要破产。因此，他们狼狈为奸，千方百计地破坏学习毛主席著作的群众运动。
    广大工农兵、革命知识分子和革命干部，无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想。他们学习毛主席著作的坚强决心，是任何力量也动摇不了的。
    为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，我们要以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，更深入地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其死党彭真一伙批倒批臭，在广大革命群众中大立特立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。让毛泽东思想的光芒普照全中国，普照全世界！

    反革命修正主义分子彭真和中国赫鲁晓夫一样，对我们工人活学活用毛主席著作，怕得要死，恨之入骨。他们挥舞起所谓“简单化、庸俗化、形式主义”的大棒，抵制活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动；他们还制造假典型，树立假样板，来欺骗群众，兜售其黑货。彭真反革命修正主义集团的主要成员刘仁亲自抓白云石车间这个点，调来大批人马总结“经验”，并采用“市委决定”的组织手段强行推广。他们胡说什么：“学不学白云石是突出不突出政治的问题，是党性纯不纯的问题。”真是混蛋透顶！白云石车间这个点，实际上是彭真反革命修正主义集团大搞资本主义复辟的“试验田”。他们打起白云石这面旗子，公然宣称：“不学毛著同样可以成为五好车间”，“不学毛著一样可以当先进人物”。他们就是反对我们学习毛主席著作。
    彭真胡说什么：“学习毛泽东思想，什么都是毛泽东思想，写了一篇文章都是毛泽东思想，容易庸俗，到处贴标签。不要名浮其实，要名符其实，有实无名不要紧，只要我们的事业前进了就行了，不要追求虚名。”彭真在白云石车间的奴才也跟着说：“毛著学的再好，生产搞不上去也不能算好！”“我不学毛著照样当五好车间的支部书记。”主子和奴才臭味相投。
    我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，如饥似渴地读毛主席的书。只要是毛主席的话，我们句句听，句句照办。特别是学了“老三篇”以后，我们心里热呼呼的，站得高了，看得远了，有使不完的力量。可是在彭真反革命修正主义集团的压制下，白云石车间四年不组织一次毛主席著作的学习。广大职工忍无可忍，一再强烈要求支部指定专人，把学习毛主席著作的工作抓起来。而彭真在白云石车间的奴才却说：“要我领导学毛著，我不干！”他不干，我们就自己组织起来干。我们每周坚持学习，无论刮风下雨，从不间断。但是，彭真和我们公司党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派竟用什么“四大自由”（自愿参加、自由结合、自定时间、自选内容）的原则，解散了我们的毛主席著作学习小组。这是什么自由？就是有他们反对学习毛主席著作的“自由”，没有我们学习毛主席著作的自由。他们还打着“劳逸结合”的招牌，取消毛主席著作学习时间；用加班加点、开一揽子会议等手段，来挤掉我们的学习时间。对此，广大职工十分气愤。
    首都钢铁公司党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派不让我们学习毛主席著作，而对中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真却奉若神明。一九六二年《修养》再版发行，他们就迫不及待地用党费购买，党员人手一册。过组织生活时，他们从来不叫学毛主席著作，却叫大学《修养》。他们还集中一些党员干部学习了两个月，连那份臭名昭著的反革命宣言书《〈前线〉发刊词》也成为必读本。
    现在，彭真反革命修正主义集团连同他们的后台中国赫鲁晓夫，已经被揪出来了。毛主席教导我们：“如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力”。我们一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，积极投入革命的大批判运动，把他们彻底打倒。让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍首都钢铁公司，插遍全中国，插遍全世界！
