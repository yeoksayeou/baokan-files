Premier Zhou Enlai Cables Prince Souphanouvong
Warmly Congratulates the 22nd Anniversary of the Lao Revolution

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, October 11 — Premier Zhou Enlai sent a cable on October 11 to Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front and Vice Premier of the Lao National United Government, warmly congratulating the 22nd anniversary of the Lao Revolution. The full text of the cable is as follows:

	Your Highness, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, Vice Premier of the Lao National United Government, Prince Souphanouvong:

	On the occasion of the 22nd anniversary of the Lao Revolution, I, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extend warm congratulations to Your Highness, the Lao Patriotic Front, and the fraternal Lao people.

	For a long time, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front and Your Highness, the Lao people have persisted in armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, demonstrating the power of people's war, achieving one victory after another, and dealing heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Lao people's struggle for national independence and to resist U.S. aggression and aid their country is, like that of the Vietnamese people, a shining example for all oppressed nations and peoples in Asia and the world, showing that they dare to fight and dare to win. It shows to the world that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger; the truly powerful force is not the hollow U.S. imperialism but the revolutionary people who are united and dare to resist aggression. We warmly applaud the brilliant victories achieved by the Lao people in their struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid their country.

	China and Laos are neighboring countries. In the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, our two peoples have forged a combat friendship. After being tempered by the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 700 million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are a solid rear guard for the Lao people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid their country. The Chinese people will always stand with the fraternal Lao people, fully supporting the Lao people's just struggle until they achieve final victory.

	Zhou Enlai
	Premier, State Council of the People's Republic of China
	October 11, 1967

　　周恩来总理致电苏发努冯亲王
    热烈祝贺老挝革命节二十二周年
    新华社十一日讯　周恩来总理十一日致电苏发努冯亲王，热烈祝贺老挝革命节二十二周年。电报全文如下：桑怒老挝爱国战线党主席老挝民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王殿下：
    在老挝革命节二十二周年的时候，我代表中国政府和中国人民向亲王殿下、老挝爱国战线党和兄弟的老挝人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    长期以来，老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党和亲王殿下的领导下，坚持了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争，发挥了人民战争的威力，取得了一个又一个的重大胜利，给予了美帝国主义及其走狗以沉重的打击。老挝人民为争取民族独立所进行的抗美救国斗争，同越南人民一样，为亚洲和全世界一切被压迫民族和人民作出了敢于斗争，敢于胜利的榜样。它向全世界表明，美帝国主义是一只纸老虎；真正强大的不是外强中干的美帝国主义，而是团结一致，敢于反抗侵略的革命人民。我们热烈欢呼老挝人民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的光辉胜利。
    中国同老挝是近邻，我们两国人民在反对我们的共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，结成了战斗的友谊。经过伟大的无产阶级文化大革命锻炼，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，是老挝人民抗美救国斗争的坚强后盾。我国人民将永远同兄弟的老挝人民站在一起，全力支援老挝人民的正义斗争，直到老挝人民取得最后的胜利。
        中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                        一九六七年十月十一日
