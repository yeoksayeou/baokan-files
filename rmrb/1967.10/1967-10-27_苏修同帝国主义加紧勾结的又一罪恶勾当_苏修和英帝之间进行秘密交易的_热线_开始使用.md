The Soviet revisionist leadership and British imperialism, for the purpose of facilitating direct secret political deals, have set up a "hotline," which began formal operation on the 24th. This is another counter-revolutionary action by the Soviet revisionist clique in colluding with imperialist countries led by U.S. imperialism.

According to reports, this line connects the British Prime Minister's office in London with the Kremlin in Moscow, passing through Bonn, Stockholm, Oslo, and Helsinki, with a total length of 1,700 miles. Both sides can use teletypewriters or engage in verbal communication.

British newspapers point out that this "hotline" allows British imperialists to contact the Soviet revisionist leaders at any time to "consult urgently on major developments in international affairs."

This "hotline" was decided upon during Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin's visit to London in February this year, in conjunction with British Prime Minister Wilson. Later, in August, the two countries signed an agreement in London to establish the "hotline."

This is the third "hotline" established by the Soviet revisionist clique with Western imperialist countries. As early as June 1963, the first "hotline" between the Soviet Union and the United States was completed. In June of this year, another "hotline" between Moscow and Paris was also completed. According to British newspaper reports, the Soviet and U.S. sides now test each other's lines every day to ensure they are unobstructed.

    苏修同帝国主义加紧勾结的又一罪恶勾当
    苏修和英帝之间进行秘密交易的“热线”开始使用
    据新华社伦敦二十五日电　苏联修正主义领导集团和英帝国主义之间，为了便于进行直接的秘密政治交易而安设的“热线”，已于二十四日开始正式使用。这是苏修集团同以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家加紧勾结的又一反革命行动。
    据报道，这条把伦敦英国首相府同莫斯科克里姆林宫连接起来的线路，经过波恩、斯德哥尔摩、奥斯陆和赫尔辛基，全长一千七百英里。双方可以使用电传打字机或进行口头联系。
    英国报纸指出，这条“热线”，使英帝国主义者能随时同苏修集团头子“接触”，“就重大的国际事态发展进行紧急磋商”。
    这条“热线”是在今年二月间苏修头子柯西金访问伦敦时，同英国首相威尔逊共同决定建立的。而后，今年八月两国又在伦敦签署了一项安设“热线”的协定。
    这是苏修集团同西方帝国主义国家建立的第三条“热线”。早在一九六三年六月，苏、美之间建成了第一条“热线”。今年六月又建成了莫斯科和巴黎之间的“热线”。据英国报纸报道，苏、美双方现在每天都要试验相互间的线路是否畅通。
