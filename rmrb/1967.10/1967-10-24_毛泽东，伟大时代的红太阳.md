Great leader Mao Zedong, I yearn to see you every moment. For so many years, I have thought of you day and night. Even if it were just for an instant, this instant would become eternal. Mao Zedong, the red sun of a great era!

The sun in the universe, though it can make all things flourish, cannot shine on the hearts of the poor people, nor on their thatched huts. Mao Zedong, the red sun of a great era! Your great thoughts are boundless and endless, illuminating the hearts of the proletariat around the world, bringing sunlight and spring breezes to their broken homes.

Mao Zedong, the great helmsman of the world revolution! The sea has towering waves and raging storms. The great helmsman, you have pointed out the direction, guiding the revolutionary ship through a victorious voyage. Storms rage across Asia, fires burn brightly in Africa, and Latin America roars in awakening... Your great thoughts ignite the sparks of revolution everywhere.

In our beautiful Vietnamese homeland, I have seen your great image and benevolent smile. In the red book of quotations, I have seen your profound thoughts and vast heart. In your magnificent poems, I hear the majestic footsteps of your Long March, which are prophecies of victory, like thunderous echoes.

Great people, glorious national day, sunlight shining, red flags fluttering. I finally see you, in the festive Beijing. You ascend the majestic Tiananmen Gate, radiant and eyes shining. This happiness, what words can describe? Though it is just a brief moment, this moment will become eternal.

The red sun rises from the east of the world, cheers echo in the sea of the masses: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" Listen, the boundless sea of joy surges with waves. At this moment, I am so moved that tears well up, and I join the sea's waves, raising my arms to shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong!"

Great Mao Zedong, you have achieved new and great feats. It is you who ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This great revolution is a milestone of our era, ensuring that the proletarian dictatorship in China will forever be vibrant.

Mao Zedong, the red sun of a great era! In this cultural revolution that shakes the world, I am fortunate to see you, and this happiness will last a lifetime. See the sunlight shining for me, see the time rejoicing for me. This unforgettable and precious moment will become eternal in my heart. Ah, Mao Zedong, the red sun of a great era, how can I express my boundless respect for you! How can I express my boundless love for you, ah, the red sun of a great era, Mao Zedong!
