The Yichun Forestry Bureau in the Xiaoxing'anling region, with the assistance of a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for 58 grassroots cadres who had made mistakes to varying degrees. They studied and applied Mao Zedong's works, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and consciously carried out revolution, achieving remarkable results.

The cadres participating in this study class were all good or relatively good cadres who had passed the test of the socialist education movement. However, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, they made mistakes of varying degrees in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and were criticized and struggled against by the masses. They had "selfish" thoughts and could not change their minds. This situation was not conducive to the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and the promotion of revolution and production in this bureau.

The study class focused on the active thoughts of these cadres, organizing them to study Mao Zedong's "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and Mao Zedong's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This allowed them to sit down and think deeply, break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Through the study class, by studying and applying Mao Zedong's works, engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, the cadres freed themselves from the spiritual shackles of selfishness and drew a clear line in their minds between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. The former secretary of the Party branch of Baihualin Forest Farm, Xu Zhaofan, was previously influenced by "Cultivation of Morality" and carried out the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "material incentives" and "profit-oriented" policies pushed by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. When criticized by the masses, he still could not understand. In this study, through a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalist-roaders within the forestry Party, he realized that the root of the problem was with the Chinese Khrushchev and the poison was within himself. He made countless mistakes because he did not study Mao Zedong's works well and did not seriously reform his worldview. After returning to the farm, he took the lead in studying Mao Zedong's works, leading in self-criticism, leading in revolutionary criticism, and participating in production labor, and was welcomed by the masses.

The cadres participating in the study, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, further understood Mao Zedong's theory, line, policy, and principles on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, generally raised their consciousness, and put down their burdens. The 58 cadres who participated in the study class, after returning to their units, all voluntarily checked with the masses, actively talked with the masses, actively participated in work, took the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong's works, carried out revolutionary criticism, and promoted the reform of their units. This effectively promoted the achievement of revolutionary unity throughout the bureau and laid a good foundation for the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The bureau saw a flourishing scene of seizing revolution and promoting production.

    既要弄清思想又要团结同志
    伊春林区友好林业局举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织犯错误的干部参加学习，斗私批修，自觉革命，获得显著效果
    据新华社哈尔滨二十日电　小兴安岭伊春林区友好林业局在人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席
  “既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的教导，组织犯过不同程度错误的五十八名基层领导干部参加毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，自觉革命，获得了显著的效果。
    参加这次学习班的干部都是经过社会主义教育运动考验的好的和比较好的干部。但是，由于他们受了资产阶级反动路线的毒害，在无产阶级文化大革命中犯了不同程度的错误，受到了群众的批判和斗争。他们头脑中有“私”字，思想上转不过弯来。这种情况，对这个局的革命大批判、革命大联合和抓革命、促生产很不利。
    学习班紧紧抓住这些干部的活思想，组织他们重点学习毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作和毛主席有关无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，使他们坐下来好好想问题，破私立公。在学习班中，通过活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，干部们从“私”字的精神枷锁下解放出来了，从思想上划清了无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的界限。白桦林场原党支部书记许兆凡，过去由于受了《修养》的毒害，执行了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”的反革命修正主义路线。群众批判他，他还想不通。在这次学习中，他通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和林区党内走资本主义道路当权派，认识到根在中国赫鲁晓夫那里，毒在自己身上，千错万错，就错在自己没有很好地学习毛主席著作，没有认真改造世界观。回场后，他带头学习毛主席著作，带头斗私心，带头搞革命大批判，带头参加生产劳动，受到群众的欢迎。
    参加学习的干部，通过斗私批修，进一步理解了毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，普遍提高了觉悟，放下了包袱。参加学习班的五十八名干部，回到本单位后，都自觉地向群众作了检查，主动找群众谈心，积极参加工作，带头活学活用毛主席著作，开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。从而有力地促进全局实现了革命的大联合，为实现革命的“三结合”奠定了良好的基础。局内出现了抓革命、促生产的欣欣向荣的大好景象。
