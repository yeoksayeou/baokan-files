The military and civilians of New An—Di An in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on twelve enemy strongholds on October 12, annihilating over 800 enemies in a single battle. This glorious victory was a tribute to the convening of the Second Heroic Warriors Conference of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam.

At 1:30 AM on October 12, the military and civilians of New An—Di An simultaneously attacked eleven enemy strongholds along the Fourth Highway west of Saigon.

On the U.S. artillery position one kilometer away from the city of Bien Hoa, the liberation forces immediately paralyzed the enemy's entire firepower at the start of the battle, annihilating a U.S. artillery battalion, destroying ten cannons, including six 175mm, 155mm, and 105mm cannons, and destroying thirty-eight military vehicles, including six armored cars. They also destroyed fifty-two enemy barracks, warehouses, and ammunition depots.

In the battle to attack the base of the 4th Battalion of the 50th Regiment of the 25th Division of the puppet army in the Go Dat district, the liberation forces annihilated three companies and a battalion command post of the puppet army, severely damaged a "pacification" unit, and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.

In the attacks on the command post of the 50th Regiment of the 25th Division of the puppet army, the city of Bien Hoa, the military support area of Hiep Thanh, and the enemy strongholds of Tan Binh and Phu Ly, the liberation forces' attacks were swift and decisive. They seized the enemy positions in just a few minutes, rendering the enemy's cannons useless.

Faced with the fierce attacks of the military and civilians of New An—Di An, the enemy was almost entirely paralyzed and unable to resist. It was not until the morning of October 12 that the enemy was able to gather some troops to go to the rescue and retrieve the bodies. However, this group of enemies was repeatedly ambushed by the guerrillas on the way.

While attacking the eleven strongholds along the Fourth Highway, the military and civilians of Duc Hoa County also launched a fierce attack on the enemy stronghold of Luc Giang on October 12. Preliminary reports indicate that four enemy companies were annihilated or severely damaged, and six armored cars were destroyed.

According to reports from the Liberation Communications Agency of South Vietnam, guerrilla forces and local troops active in various parts of South Vietnam have recently been coordinating with the liberation army, launching continuous strikes and annihilating large numbers of enemy forces.

From September 19 to 29, the guerrilla forces in the province of Binh Dinh frequently attacked the enemy, eliminating and disintegrating 335 enemy personnel, including over 200 U.S. soldiers, and sinking or damaging five warships.

From August 10 to 18, the guerrilla forces in the southern part of Quang Nam Province bravely fought and smashed a "sweeping" operation launched by the American aggressors. Using various makeshift weapons, they annihilated nearly 450 enemies, shot down fifteen U.S. planes, and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.

From August 30 to September 10, the local troops and guerrilla forces in the province of Quang Ngai launched extensive attacks on various battlefields, eliminating nearly 300 enemies, including the complete annihilation of two platoons of the South Korean puppet army. They also destroyed five puppet government institutions. On the night of September 10, the local troops and guerrilla forces of Quang Ngai Province infiltrated into the city of Qui Nhon, attacking a company of puppet soldiers guarding the western part of Qui Nhon Airport. They annihilated over forty enemies, destroyed eight enemy barracks, one cannon, and seized a batch of weapons. The guerrilla forces of this province also eliminated many enemies near Cam Ranh Bay on August 30 and 31, blew up a military train, shot down three planes, and destroyed a bridge.

On the night of September 1, the guerrilla forces and local troops in the province of Khanh Hoa suddenly attacked a main force battalion of the puppet army stationed in the new village of Chau Thanh County. After just ten minutes of battle, the guerrilla forces and local troops completely annihilated an enemy company and seized all the enemy's weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

From August 10 to 30, the guerrilla forces in the province of Pleiku continuously ambushed the enemy on the 13th Highway, destroying or damaging twenty-two enemy tanks and armored cars, and shooting down two helicopters. The guerrilla forces of three communes in the county of Buon Ma Thuot destroyed ninety U.S. soldiers, shot down two planes, and destroyed or damaged twenty enemy tanks and armored cars from August 28 to September 4.
