New Delhi, Oct. 9 (Xinhua) - Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Desai, who is a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, returned to New Delhi on Oct. 6 after a month-long trip to North America and Western Europe. During his "visit," in order to beg for more "aid" from Western countries, especially his U.S. master, he expressed that the Indian reactionaries would more frantically oppose China. He promised to sell out more national interests.

Desai, during his visits, begged for money on one hand and used the aggressive actions of the Indian government to frantically propagate anti-China sentiments, distorting facts to slander China for attacking India. During his stay in the U.S., Desai openly admitted the Indian reactionary government's secret plot to follow U.S. imperialism in creating "two Chinas." Not content with that, upon his return to New Delhi, he again shouted about the so-called "two Chinas" in reality.

Besides begging for money, food, and weapons from his U.S. master, Desai eagerly courted U.S. capitalists to invest in India, promising them various conveniences. He also begged the West German government for a loan of 250 million marks (equivalent to over $60 million). According to Indian newspapers, the Indian government hopes that Desai's trip will make the "aid-to-India consortium" formed by Western countries agree to provide more "aid" to India at the meeting scheduled to begin in November this year.

The Indian United News Agency revealed on Oct. 7 that the U.S. also promised to provide so-called "nuclear protection" to India, proposing to establish a so-called "anti-ballistic missile system" in India, which in reality is to turn India into a military base for aggressive war.

All these indicate that the Indian reactionaries rely on U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to consolidate their rule, which will inevitably result in India becoming further colonized by them.

### 乞钱乞粮乞枪　反华反共反人民　印度副总理去北美西欧活动后回国

　　乞钱乞粮乞枪　反华反共反人民
　　印度副总理去北美西欧活动后回国
    据新华社九日讯　新德里消息：印度副总理兼财政部长、美帝的忠实走狗德赛去北美和西欧等地活动一个月后，六日回到新德里。他在“访问”期间，为了向西方国家特别是美国主子乞讨更多的“援助”，表示印度反动派要更加疯狂地反华，答应出卖更多民族利益。
    德赛在他所到之处，一面要钱，一面利用印度政府的这些侵略行动疯狂进行反华宣传，颠倒黑白地诬蔑中国进攻印度。德赛在美国期间，把印度反动政府暗中追随美帝国主义搞“两个中国”的阴谋，公开招认出来。这还不够，他在回到新德里的时候，又叫嚷什么“实际上”有“两个中国”。
    德赛除了向美国主子乞钱、乞粮、乞枪以外，竭力招揽美国资本家到印度去投资，答应给他们各种方便。他还向西德政府乞讨到二亿五千万马克（合六千多万美元）的贷款。据印度报纸说，印度政府希望，德赛此行能使西方国家组成的“援印财团”，在今年十一月开始举行的会议上，答应给印度更多“援助”。
    印度联合新闻社七日透露，美帝还答应给予印度所谓“核保护”，提出要在印度建立所谓“反弹道导弹系统”，实际上是把印度变成侵略战争的军事基地。
    这些表明，印度反动派依赖美帝及其帮凶来巩固自己的统治，结果必然是使印度进一步沦为它们的殖民地。
