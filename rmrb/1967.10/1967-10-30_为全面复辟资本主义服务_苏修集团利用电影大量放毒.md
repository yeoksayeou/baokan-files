The Soviet revisionist clique has always regarded films as an important tool for promoting their revisionist political line and fully restoring capitalism. Over the years, the Soviet revisionist clique has used films to extensively instill various bourgeois ideological poisons into the Soviet people, numbing and poisoning the broad masses of the Soviet people.

	Defaming Lenin and fiercely attacking Stalin

	Soviet revisionist films vigorously promote humanitarianism, even imposing it on Lenin. The "Cultural Daily" strongly advocates describing Lenin with "today's" perspective to "meet the emotional needs of modern audiences." Films based on Lenin, such as "Lenin in Poland," "The Story of Lenin," and "On One Planet," slander Lenin for acting primarily "as a human being," falsely claiming that Lenin once "worried" about releasing unrepentant enemies, portraying Lenin as a bourgeois philanthropist and "humanitarian."

	To cater to the Soviet revisionist clique's need to fiercely attack Stalin, the Soviet film industry has produced several films that directly and indirectly attack Stalin. The most outrageous ones include "Silence," "The Living and the Dead," and "Bright Skies." Among them, "Silence" openly propagates that "after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, people have shed the heavy burdens of suspicion, dogma, and outdated rules."

	Promoting decadent lifestyles and defaming the Soviet people

	To numb the revolutionary will of the Soviet people and promote the bourgeois lifestyle, films advocating such lifestyles have emerged one after another. The Soviet propaganda machine also admits that on Soviet screens, "there are often various idle young people and petty bourgeoisie." The American "Time" magazine, in reviewing a Soviet film "A Few Days in a Year" that depicts love stories, said that in the past, the main characters in Soviet films were "Stakhanovite workers and powerful speakers," but in this film, they are "bourgeois" like the West. This situation shows how far the "quietly developing liberalism" has progressed.

	A film praised by the Soviet revisionists as "friendly," "ingenious," "joyful," and "harmonious," titled "I Walk in Moscow," is actually an "American-style" film. The film is accompanied by "jazz music" and fully imitates the style of "Hollywood." The Soviet youth in the film are depicted as American hoodlums. A foreign newspaper said that if all Soviet letters were replaced with American letters and it was announced that this was an American production, no audience would doubt it.

	Promoting war terror and advocating pacifism

	Following the "purpose and task" of spreading war terror and peddling the philosophy of survival, the Soviet revisionist clique has, over the years, extensively screened films that promote the hardships of war and advocate pacifism. For example, "The Soldier's Song" advocates that "war is so abnormal, and peace is so beautiful." "The Competition" advocates "conquering the enemy's heart with art and preventing war." "The Lark" describes the "cruel and terrifying fascist prisoner-of-war camp" and exaggerates the "suspicious and desperate psychology" of Soviet soldiers in the prisoner-of-war camp, etc.

	Opening the door wide for Western films

	The Soviet revisionist clique extensively peddles Western culture and opens the door wide for Western films. In recent years, Western films have flooded Soviet screens, and Moscow has become a "small shop" for selling Western films. According to the Soviet revisionist "Film Weekly," in 1965, 125 Soviet art films were shown, while 108 foreign films were shown in the same year, most of which were from Western capitalist countries. For example, in the second half of May this year, 42 Soviet films were shown in Moscow's cinemas, while 91 foreign films were shown.

	Among these Western films, decadent, reactionary bourgeois ideologies and lifestyles are rampant.

	Actively promoting anti-China activities with the United States

	The Soviet revisionist leaders also use films to vigorously advocate for a joint effort with the United States against China. In recent years, they have actively produced films that directly or indirectly attack China and vigorously advocate for "Soviet-American cooperation." The French film "The Sky Above" advocates for "Soviet-American joint efforts to repel the threat of atomic maniacs to humanity," which has been highly praised by the Soviet revisionists. The so-called "international film festival" held in Moscow in July, where the Soviet revisionist reactionary film "The Reporter" won the "grand prize," fully exposed the filthy face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's joint effort with the United States against China.

	The decadent and reactionary Soviet revisionist films have sparked strong dissatisfaction and protests from the broad masses of the Soviet people.

	The broad masses of the Soviet people are not interested in the "masterpieces" films that the Soviet revisionists strongly recommend. Some films that have won numerous awards at all-Soviet and international film festivals and are praised as the "most valuable assets" of the Soviet film industry, possessing "all the characteristics of superb art," have very low distribution quotas and do not reach the so-called "planned profits" of the Soviet revisionists.

### 为全面复辟资本主义服务  苏修集团利用电影大量放毒

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

    为全面复辟资本主义服务
    苏修集团利用电影大量放毒
    苏修统治集团一直把电影视为推行修正主义政治路线、全面复辟资本主义的重要工具。多年来，苏修统治集团通过电影，大肆向苏联人民灌输形形色色的资产阶级思想毒素，麻痹、毒害广大的苏联人民。
  污蔑列宁，大反斯大林
    苏修电影大肆宣扬人道主义，甚至把人道主义强加给列宁。《文化报》极力鼓吹要用“今天的”眼光描写列宁，以“符合现代观众的感情需要。”以列宁为题材的电影，如《列宁在波兰》、《列宁的故事》、《在一个星球上》等，诬蔑列宁首先“作为人”而活动，胡说列宁曾经为释放怙恶不悛的敌人而“操心”，把列宁描写成一个资产阶级的慈善家，“人道主义者”。
    迎合苏修统治集团大反斯大林的需要，苏修电影界炮制了不少指名和影射攻击斯大林的影片，最猖狂的有《寂静》、《生者与死者》、《明朗的天空》等。其中《寂静》公开宣传“苏共二十大后人们卸下了怀疑教条和陈规等重担。”
  宣扬腐朽生活，
    丑化苏联人民
    为了麻痹苏联人民的革命意志，宣扬资产阶级生活方式的影片纷纷出笼。苏修的宣传机器也供认，在苏联银幕上，“经常出现形形色色的游手好闲的年轻人”和“小市民”。美国《时代》周刊在评一部描写谈情说爱的苏联影片《一年中的几天》时说，过去苏联影片中的主角都是“斯达哈诺夫式工作者和说话有力的农民”，而这部影片中却是和西方一样的“资产阶级”，这种情况表明“悄悄发展的自由主义已进展到什么程度”。
    被苏修吹捧为“亲切”、“巧妙”、“欢乐”、“和谐”的一部丑化苏联青年的影片《我漫步在莫斯科》，实际上是一部“美国式”的影片。影片配的是“爵士音乐”，学足了“好莱坞”的格调。影片中的苏联青年被描写得象美国阿飞一样。一家外国报纸说，假如把所有苏联字母以美国字母代替，宣布这是美国出品的话，相信没有一个观众感到怀疑。
  宣传战争恐怖，
    鼓吹和平主义
      “遵循”苏修统治集团散布战争恐怖，兜售活命哲学的“目的和任务”，多年来，苏修银幕上大量上演宣传战争苦难，鼓吹和平主义的影片。如宣扬“战争是多么反常，和平是多么美好”的《士兵之歌》，鼓吹“以艺术征服敌人的心并防止了战争”的《比赛》，描写“残酷而可怕的法西斯俘虏营”、渲染苏军战士在俘虏营中“多疑绝望心理”的《云雀》等等。为西方电影大开绿灯
    苏修统治集团大肆贩卖西方文化，对西方电影大开绿灯。几年来，西方电影充斥苏联银幕，莫斯科成了“出售”西方影片的“小卖铺”。据苏修《电影周报》透露，一九六五年上演苏艺术片一百二十五部，而同年上演外国影片就有一百零八部，其中多数是西方资本主义国家的。又如，今年五月下半月，莫斯科的电影院上映苏联影片四十二部，而上映的外国片达九十一部之多。
    在这些西方影片中，腐朽透顶的、反动的资产阶级思想和生活方式无奇不有。
  大搞联美反华活动
    苏修头目还利用电影大肆鼓吹联美反华。近年来，他们积极拍摄指名或影射反华的影片，同时大肆鼓吹苏美“合作”。法国影片《头上的天空》鼓吹“苏美联合击退原子狂人对人类的威胁”，就大受苏修的赞赏。今年七月份在莫斯科举行的所谓国际“电影节”上获得“大奖”的苏修反动影片《记者》，集中暴露了苏修领导集团联美反华的肮脏嘴脸。
    腐朽反动的苏修电影，引起了广大苏联人民群众的强烈不满和抗议。
    苏联广大群众对苏修大力推荐着的“杰作”影片不感兴趣。一些在全苏和国际电影节屡次获奖、被捧之为苏电影界“最宝贵的资产”，“具有高超艺术的一切特征”的影片，发行指标很低，都达不到苏修的所谓“计划利润”。
