Fierce Call to Intensify People's War on Laos National Day

KANGO, Oct. 9 (Xinhua) — In a speech at a reception celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the Laos National Day, Phoumi Vongvichit, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao Patriotic Government, said: "Where there is oppression, there will be resistance; where there is foreign aggression, there will be resistance to aggression. The hatred of the Lao people for the U.S. imperialist aggressors has become an invincible force."

Phoumi Vongvichit made these remarks at a reception celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the Laos National Day.

Phoumi Vongvichit emphasized: "The revolution has made us see clearly: who are our enemies and who are our friends." No matter how the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys plot, the Lao people have seen through the U.S. imperialists' and their lackeys' deceptive schemes of so-called "peace," "independence," and "national unity government," and have seen more clearly the treacherous acts of the Vientiane puppet clique. He went on to point out: The current disturbances by the enemy do not indicate any hope of victory for them; on the contrary, they indicate that they are already in a state of serious failure. They have only one way to go: to move towards greater, more comprehensive, and final failure. Phoumi Vongvichit emphasized the need to strengthen the construction of the three armed forces—regular troops, local troops, and guerrilla militias—to comprehensively build and consolidate liberated areas, develop bases, and ensure the victory of the people's war. He called on all cadres, soldiers, and people to unite more closely and, on the basis of existing victories, to fight to the end for the complete victory of the anti-American national salvation struggle.

In his speech, Phoumi Vongvichit expressed warm praise for the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction and high respect and heartfelt thanks for the wholehearted assistance given by the Chinese people in the anti-American national salvation struggle. He wished the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Also present at the reception were representatives of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front stationed in Xieng Khouang, leaders of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, and heads of various administrative organs and mass organizations, as well as cadres from the two patriotic forces. The heads of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission to Laos and the Economic and Cultural Mission of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Laos were also invited to attend the reception and spoke at the meeting.

    冯维希在老挝革命节招待会上号召人民更有力地开展人民战争
    为争取抗美救国斗争的完全胜利而战斗
    热烈祝贺中国人民在文化大革命中取得辉煌胜利
    据新华社康开九日电  老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣富米·冯维希八日发表讲话说：哪里有压迫，哪里就一定有反抗压迫的斗争；哪里有外来侵略，哪里就一定有反抗侵略的斗争。老挝人民对美帝国主义侵略者的仇恨已变成不可战胜的坚强4力量。
    富米·冯维希是在庆祝老挝革命节二十二周年的招待会上讲这些话的。
    富米·冯维希强调说：“革命已使我们看清：谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。”不管美帝国主义及其走狗怎样玩弄阴谋，老挝人民识破了美帝国主义及其走狗宣扬的所谓“和平”、“独立”、“民族联合政府”的欺骗阴谋，更看清了万象傀儡集团的卖国勾当。他接着指出：目前敌人的捣乱一点也不说明他们有什么胜利的希望，恰恰说明他们已经到了严重失败的地步。他们只有一条路可走：就是走向更大的、全面的、最后的失败。富米·冯维希强调要大力加强正规部队、地方部队和民兵游击队三种武装力量的建设，要全面建设和巩固解放区，发展根据地，以保证人民战争的胜利进行。他号召全体干部、战士和人民更紧密地团结起来，在现有胜利的基础上，为争取抗美救国斗争的完全胜利而冲锋陷阵。
    富米·冯维希在讲话中对中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就表示热烈赞扬，对中国人民在抗美救国斗争中给予老挝人民的全心全意的援助表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢，并祝中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的、用毛泽东思想作为指针的中国共产党的英明领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得辉煌胜利。
    出席招待会的还有老挝爱国战线党中央委员会驻川圹代表，老挝爱国中立力量领导委员会负责人以及各行政机关、群众组织的负责人和两支爱国力量所属部队的干部。中国驻老挝经济文化代表团和越南民主共和国驻老挝经济文化代表团负责人都应邀出席了招待会，并分别在会上讲了话。
