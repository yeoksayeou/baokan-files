The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of all fronts in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have achieved revolutionary unity under the guidance of the extremely important latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao. Recently, they have successively established workers', peasants', Red Guards' representative assemblies, and the Hohhot Municipal and Autonomous Region Directly Affiliated Organs Revolutionary Staff Representative Assembly. On all fronts, revolutionary unity has been basically achieved in schools by class and department, in factories by work teams and workshops, and in offices by sections and bureaus. This has formed a mighty revolutionary army to launch a great struggle and criticism against China's Khrushchev and the clique of capitalist roaders within the Inner Mongolia Party. This is a new achievement of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Hohhot region in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. It is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

During the convening of the five representative assemblies in Hohhot, the great instruction from Chairman Mao to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" was received. The representatives, upon hearing the news, immediately convened a "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" rally. They took "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle to conduct serious self-criticism on the "self" issues such as "self-centeredness," vying for positions, and egalitarianism. This promoted the successful birth of the five representative assemblies.

The successful establishment of the five representative assemblies in Hohhot marks a leap in the revolutionary unity in this region, indicating that the strength of the proletarian revolutionary masses here has reached an unprecedented level of unity and strength, and a new revolutionary order has been established. This great situation will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the further development and more brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Inner Mongolia region.

Since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially in February this year, the broad proletarian revolutionary masses represented by "Hutong Sanwei," "Fire Engine," and "August 18" have, in the life-and-death struggle against the clique of capitalist roaders within the Inner Mongolia Party, raised the banner of revolutionary unity, united, and formed their own command headquarters—the Hohhot Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Headquarters. However, after achieving initial victories in the Cultural Revolution, some people forgot the long-term and complex nature of the struggle; some became arrogant and self-satisfied, seeing themselves as heroes; some vied for fame and fortune, and sought positions. These thoughts hindered the further consolidation and development of revolutionary unity. Especially in some schools, offices, factories, and enterprises, due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line, the "self" issue, and the sabotage by class enemies from both the "ultra-left" and right sides, the grassroots mass organizations split into two opposing factions, fighting "internal wars" and disrupting the overall direction of the struggle.

To build a highly proletarianized and combat-ready proletarian revolutionary mass force, to consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, to carry out a thorough criticism and struggle, and to promote the "three-in-one combination," the preparatory committee of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and the Hohhot Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Headquarters, while seriously leading the revolutionary criticism struggle, convened a city-wide political work conference for the proletarian revolutionary masses in early June. Various revolutionary organizations simultaneously conducted open rectification. In July and August, the preparatory committee of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee consecutively held study sessions on Chairman Mao's works. The leaders and members of the preparatory committee studied with all revolutionary mass organization leaders in the city Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," and Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary unity. They discussed the current situation, tasks, and work guidelines together. These study sessions followed the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," using the method of exposing thoughts and unloading burdens to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness. They criticized bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts such as anarchism, individualism, factionalism, and seeking fame, greatly raising the consciousness of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Many young revolutionaries said, "We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards and will never be the defenders of 'self'."

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hohhot, who are carrying out the "three supports and two military" tasks, go wherever they go to spread Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly propagate Chairman Mao's great instructions to the revolutionary masses, strengthen political and ideological work among the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses, and strive to promote revolutionary unity.

In mid-September, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great instruction that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." This instruction, like a strong east wind, swept across the entire Hohhot. "Follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite, and thoroughly criticize and denounce China's Khrushchev" became the common call of the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses throughout the city. An irresistible red storm of revolutionary unity quickly swept across the entire Hohhot. The working class is most loyal to Chairman Mao and listens to Chairman Mao's words the most. When Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they took the lead, responded resolutely, and led the way in dismantling factions and achieving revolutionary unity. By September 18, they quickly established the preparatory committee for the workers' congress. More than 95% of the units in the city's industrial, transportation, and financial and trade systems achieved revolutionary unity, becoming a model for revolutionary unity throughout the city.

    活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    呼和浩特市五个代表大会胜利诞生
    各条战线基本实现学校按班系，工厂按作业组车间，机关按科室处的革命大联合
    据新华社呼和浩特二十一日电  内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市各条战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在伟大领袖毛主席极为重要的最新指示指引下，实现了革命大联合，最近先后成立了工人、农民、红卫兵代表大会和呼和浩特市、自治区直属机关革命职工代表大会。在各条战线上，基本上实现了学校按班系，工厂按作业组、车间，机关按科室、处的革命大联合，从而汇合成对中国赫鲁晓夫和内蒙古党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大批判、大斗争的浩浩荡荡的革命大军。这是呼和浩特地区无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的新成就。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    呼和浩特市工代会、红代会等五个代表大会召开期间，传来了毛主席的要斗私，批修的伟大指示。代表们闻风而动，马上召开“斗私，批修”誓师大会，以“斗私，批修”为纲，对“以我为核心”和争席位、闹平均主义等“私”字，进行了认真的自我批评，促进了五个代表大会的胜利诞生。
    呼和浩特市五个代表大会的胜利成立，是呼和浩特地区革命大联合的飞跃发展，标志着这个地区无产阶级革命派的力量已经空前强大，空前统一，革命新秩序已经建立。这一大好形势，对今后内蒙古地区无产阶级文化大革命的更加深入发展，取得更加辉煌的胜利，一定会产生深远影响。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，特别是今年二月，以“呼三司”、“火车头”、“八·一八”为代表的广大无产阶级革命派，在同内蒙古党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行的生死搏斗中，高举革命大联合的旗帜，团结起来，组成了自己的战斗司令部——呼和浩特革命造反联络总部。但是，文化大革命取得初步胜利以后，有的人忘记了斗争的长期性和复杂性；有些人产生了骄傲自满和以功臣自居的情绪；有的人争名利，计地位。这些思想情绪阻碍了革命大联合的进一步巩固和发展。特别是有些学校、机关、工厂、企业的基层群众组织，由于资产阶级反动路线的流毒和影响，由于“私”字作怪，同时由于阶级敌人从极“左”方面和从右的方面进行破坏，又分成了对立的两派，互相打“内战”，扰乱了斗争的大方向。
    为了建设一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的无产阶级革命派队伍，为了巩固和发展革命的大联合，搞好革命的大批判，推动革命的“三结合”，自治区革命委员会筹备小组和呼和浩特市革命造反联络总部在认真领导开展革命大批判的同时，在六月初召开了全市无产阶级革命派政治工作会议。各革命组织同时普遍进行了开门整风。七、八月份，自治区革命委员会筹备小组又连续举办了毛主席著作学习会，筹备小组负责人和成员同全市所有革命群众组织的负责人在一起，学习毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，以及毛主席关于革命大联合的指示，一起座谈讨论当前形势、任务和工作方针。这些学习会都按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，采取亮思想、卸包袱的方法，破私立公，批判了无政府主义、个人主义、山头主义、风头主义等资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，大大提高了无产阶级革命派的觉悟。许多革命小将说，我们是毛主席红卫兵，决不做“私”字的保皇派。
    执行“三支”“两军”任务的中国人民解放军驻呼和浩特部队广大指战员，走到那里就把毛泽东思想宣传到那里，反复向革命群众宣传毛主席的伟大指示，加强对无产阶级革命派和革命群众的政治思想工作，努力促进革命大联合。
    九月中旬，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的伟大指示，这个指示象强劲的东风，吹遍了整个呼和浩特。“紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，联合起来，彻底批倒批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫”，成了全市无产阶级革命派、革命群众的共同呼声。一个势不可挡的革命大联合的红色风暴迅速席卷了整个呼和浩特。工人阶级最忠于毛主席，最听毛主席的话。当毛主席的最新指示一下达，他们就一马当先，坚决响应，带头铲山头，搞革命大联合，很快地在九月十八日成立起工代会筹委会。全市工交、财贸系统百分之九十五以上的单位，实现了革命大联合，成为全市革命大联合的模范。
