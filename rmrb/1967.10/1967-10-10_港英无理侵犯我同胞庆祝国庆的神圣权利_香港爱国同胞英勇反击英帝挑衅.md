Hong Kong patriots have been engaged in various forms of struggle over the past few days, bravely counterattacking the Hong Kong British fascist authorities' frenzied sabotage and suppression of our National Day activities during the National Day period.

In the great festival marking the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities brazenly mobilized a large number of military police, spies, tore down and seized national flags hung by patriotic shops, conducted large-scale searches and disruptions of patriotic trade union halls preparing for National Day activities, beat to death and injured, and kidnapped compatriots who were watching fireworks from the ships of our country by the sea, and arbitrarily deleted content related to the praise of Mao Zedong Thought in literary programs. The anti-China atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities have aroused the great indignation of Hong Kong patriots. In addition to responding to the Hong Kong British provocations with unprecedentedly grand and fervent celebration activities, they have also carried out various forms of struggle to counter the provocations of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities.

On the 5th, fishermen from various fishing areas in Hong Kong and Kowloon declared that they would hold a market closure for three consecutive days from the 8th to the 10th of October, refusing to sell their catches in the Hong Kong British fish markets and streets. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Fishermen's Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee stated in a declaration: Our sacred right to celebrate National Day on our own land is inviolable. The Hong Kong authorities' attempt to obstruct our National Day activities is a serious political provocation against the 4 million compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and the 700 million people of our country. We strongly protest against this. We respond to the call of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee of all circles to hold a market closure to maintain the dignity of our great motherland and avenge our compatriots killed by the Hong Kong British.

On the 5th, Hong Kong patriots also set up "fake bomb arrays" in the vast areas of Red Hill, To Kwa Wan in Kowloon, and Causeway Bay, Western District in Hong Kong, confusing and exhausting the Hong Kong British military police. Anti-British and anti-violence fighters hung giant banners with slogans such as "Down with British Imperialism" on main streets, scattered anti-British and anti-violence leaflets from high-rise buildings, and compatriots fearlessly passed them around despite the threats and surveillance of Hong Kong British police and spies. The actions of the anti-British and anti-violence fighters greatly boosted the morale of the patriots and crushed the arrogance of British imperialism.

On the 3rd, patriotic youths in the Sai Kung area of the New Territories held a grand demonstration to counter the Hong Kong British fascist authorities. The vigorous patriotic youths, holding high the portrait of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and giant banners with the words "Long Live the Great Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long Live Chairman Mao!", marched forward amidst the sound of firecrackers and drums, chanting slogans and singing revolutionary songs along the way, making the entire Sai Kung area boil with excitement. The youths' heroic disregard for the stinking laws of the Hong Kong British fascists frightened the police in the nearby Sai Kung police station, who dared not come out of the door.

In schools controlled by the British, Americans, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, patriotic students fearlessly defied the threats of the Hong Kong authorities and the expulsion threats of the reactionary school authorities. During the National Day period, they wrote large slogans and distributed leaflets within the school. They hung three-story-high giant red slogans on school buildings, pasted large-character slogans on the walls of the rooftops, and scattered anti-British and anti-violence leaflets in various corners of the school. These students' patriotic actions were welcomed by the majority of their classmates. Many students shed tears of excitement when they saw the inspiring slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao, May You Live Ten Thousand Years!" "Long Live the Great People's Republic of China!" "Down with British Imperialism!" and "Smash the Slave Education!"

In recent days, the anti-persecution struggle committees of the Hong Kong student community, education sector, film industry, hawkers, and residents have also issued statements, strongly protesting against the Hong Kong British authorities' sabotage of patriotic compatriots' National Day celebrations, and expressing their determination to counter the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British with actual actions.

    港英无理侵犯我同胞庆祝国庆的神圣权利
    香港爱国同胞英勇反击英帝挑衅
    新华社香港九日电　香港爱国同胞连日来展开各种形式的斗争，英勇反击港英法西斯当局在国庆期间疯狂破坏、镇压我国庆活动的罪行。
    在我爱国同胞热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的伟大节日里，港英法西斯当局悍然出动了大批军警、特务，撕毁并劫走爱国商店悬挂的国旗，大规模搜查、捣乱正在筹备国庆活动的各爱国工会会所，打死打伤并绑架在海傍观赏我国货船燃放节日焰火的爱国同胞，无理删改文艺节目中有关歌颂毛泽东思想等内容。港英当局的反华暴行引起了香港爱国同胞的极大愤怒，他们除了用空前盛大、空前热烈的庆祝活动来回答港英的挑衅外，还进行了各种形式的斗争，回击港英法西斯当局的挑衅。
    港九各个渔区的渔民五日宣告，从十月八日至十月十日一连三天举行罢市，拒绝在港英的渔市场和市面上出售渔获物。港九渔民反迫害斗争委员会在一项声明中说：我们在自己的土地上庆祝国庆的神圣权利，是任何人所不能阻止的，港英当局妄想螳臂挡车，破坏我们的国庆活动，这是对港九四百万同胞和我国七亿人民的严重政治挑衅，对此，我们提出最强烈的抗议。我们响应港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会的号召，举行罢市，是为了维护我们伟大祖国的尊严，替被港英杀害的同胞报仇。
    五日这一天，香港爱国同胞还在九龙的红墈、土瓜湾区和香港的铜锣湾、西区等广大地区，大摆“真假炸弹阵”，把港英军警拖得晕头转向，筋疲力尽。反英抗暴战士把“打倒英帝”等巨幅标语挂在通衢大道上，从高楼大厦上把反英抗暴传单撒得漫天飞舞，爱国同胞不怕港英警察、特务的恐吓和监视，争相传阅。反英抗暴战士的行动，大长了爱国同胞的志气，大灭了港英帝国主义的威风。
    三日，新界西贡区的爱国青少年举行声势浩大的示威游行，反击港英法西斯当局。英姿勃勃的爱国青少年们，高举着我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的画像和写着“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的巨幅横额前进。他们在鞭炮和锣鼓声中高歌欢舞，沿途高呼口号，大唱革命歌曲，使整个西贡区都沸腾起来。青少年们蔑视港英法西斯臭法令的英雄气概，吓得近在咫尺的西贡警署内的警察不敢走出大门。
    在英、美、蒋帮所控制的学校里，爱国学生不怕港英当局的恐吓，不顾反动校方开除的威胁，国庆节期间在校内大写标语，大散传单。他们把三层楼高的巨幅红色标语挂在学校建筑物上，把大字标语贴到天台墙壁上，把反英抗暴传单撒在学校的各个角落。这些学生的爱国行动受到广大同学的欢迎，许多学生在看到“毛主席，祝您万寿无疆！”“伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！”“打倒英帝！”“粉碎奴化教育！”等振奋人心的标语时，禁不住流出了激动的热泪。
    连日来，香港学生界、教育界、电影界、小贩和居民的反迫害斗争委员会也纷纷发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局破坏爱国同胞庆祝国庆的活动，表示要用实际行动来回击港英的法西斯暴行。
