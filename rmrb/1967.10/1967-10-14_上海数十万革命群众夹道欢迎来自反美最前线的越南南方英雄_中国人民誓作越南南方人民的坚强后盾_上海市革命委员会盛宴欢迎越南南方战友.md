Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses in Shanghai lined the streets to welcome heroes from the anti-American frontline in South Vietnam. The Chinese people vow to be a strong backbone for the people of South Vietnam. The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee holds a banquet to welcome comrades from South Vietnam.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 13th: Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses and soldiers from the PLA's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai lined the streets today to welcome close comrades from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, led by combat hero Huang Wenden, from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Leaders from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, the PLA's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai, including Liao Zhengguo, Wang Shaoyong, Ma Tianhui, Mei Jiasheng, and Zheng Changhua, as well as leaders from revolutionary mass organizations, went to the airport to warmly welcome the comrades from South Vietnam.

The revolutionary people of Shanghai, with fraternal feelings for the comrades from South Vietnam, held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, and beat drums and gongs along both sides of the airport and streets. The national flags of the People's Republic of China and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fluttered in the wind.

At 4:16 PM, as the special plane carrying the comrades from South Vietnam slowly descended, the welcoming crowd immediately erupted in excitement, with drums and gongs resounding, and the band playing songs from both China and Vietnam such as "The Ship Sails with the Helm" and "Liberate the South." People waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically shouted, "Firmly support the great anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people!" "The Vietnamese people will surely win! The American imperialists will surely be defeated!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Salute to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam led by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho!" Huang Wenden, the team leader, and other members of the delegation stepped off the plane, and comrades Liao Zhengguo, Wang Shaoyong, and others greeted them, shaking hands warmly with the comrades from South Vietnam. The entire welcoming crowd read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao. Ten PLA soldiers then rushed forward and pinned shining Mao badges on the chests of the comrades from South Vietnam, expressing the precious friendship and combat salute of the revolutionary people and soldiers of Shanghai to the comrades from South Vietnam.

Amidst the enthusiastic cheers, the comrades from South Vietnam departed the airport by car. The tens of thousands of revolutionary masses lining the streets warmly welcomed the arrival of the comrades from South Vietnam. Among the crowd lining the streets, a thousand Red Guards performed a combat dance, paying tribute to the heroes from South Vietnam.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 13th: The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome close comrades from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, led by combat hero Huang Wenden, from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Leaders from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the PLA's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai, including Zhang Chunqiao, Liao Zhengguo, Wang Shaoyong, Ma Tianhui, Mei Jiasheng, and Zheng Changhua, as well as leaders from relevant revolutionary mass organizations, attended the banquet.

The banquet was filled with the atmosphere of unity and struggle between the peoples of China and Vietnam. During the banquet, comrades from both countries frequently raised their glasses, enthusiastically toasting to the health of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, to the health of the great leader of the Vietnamese people Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, to the great victories of the Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation struggle, and to the everlasting friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam.

Before the banquet, leaders from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Zhang Chunqiao, met with the entire delegation led by Huang Wenden, the team leader, from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and had a friendly and cordial conversation.

Comrades Liao Zhengguo and Huang Wenden both spoke at the banquet. Comrade Liao Zhengguo first, on behalf of the military and people of Shanghai, extended the warmest welcome to the heroic representatives of the Vietnamese people from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, and expressed the highest fraternal combat respect to the heroic people of South Vietnam and the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces. Comrade Liao Zhengguo highly praised the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people. He said: The heroic anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people has made a tremendous contribution to the common struggle of all peoples of the world against American imperialism. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle once again proves this great truth.

Comrade Liao Zhengguo said, the people of Shanghai, like the people of the entire country, will, regardless of any storms or waves, unswervingly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

Comrade Liao Zhengguo finally said, the delegation from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam visited Shanghai at a time when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, which is a great support to the revolutionary masses and people of Shanghai.

Comrade Huang Wenden, in his speech, expressed heartfelt thanks for the extremely enthusiastic welcome from the military and people of Shanghai. He said, the people of South Vietnam and their sole genuine representative—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam led by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho—highly value the lofty combat friendship of the brotherly Chinese people for the laboring people of South Vietnam. We guarantee that upon our return to South Vietnam, we will convey the sincere support and lofty friendship of the brotherly Chinese people to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and all the military and people of South Vietnam.

    上海市革命委员会负责人、人民解放军驻上海陆海空三军负责人廖政国、王少庸、马天水、梅嘉生、郑长华等以及革命群众组织负责人前往机场热烈欢迎越南南方战友。
    上海革命人民怀着对越南南方战友的兄弟情谊，高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高举胡志明主席和阮友寿主席的画像，敲锣打鼓迎候在机场和街道的两旁。机场上，中华人民共和国国旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜迎风飘扬。
    下午四时十六分，当越南南方战友乘坐的专机在机场徐徐降落时，欢迎人群立刻沸腾起来，锣鼓齐鸣，乐队高奏《大海航行靠舵手》《解放南方》等中越两国乐曲，人们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，激昂地高呼：“坚决支持越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争！”“越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！”“毛主席万岁！”“胡志明主席万岁！”“向以阮友寿主席为首的越南南方民族解放阵线致敬！”黄文旦团长和代表团的其他同志走下飞机时，廖政国、王少庸等同志迎上前去，同越南南方战友一一亲切握手。全场欢迎的人们齐声朗读毛主席语录。接着，十名解放军战士跑上前去，把金光闪闪的毛主席像章戴在越南南方战友的胸前，表达上海革命人民和解放军战士对越南南方战友的珍贵友情和战斗敬礼。
    越南南方战友，在一片热烈的欢呼声中，乘车离开机场。排列在街道两旁的数十万革命群众热烈欢迎越南南方战友们的到来。在夹道欢迎的人群中，由一千名红卫兵小将组成的队伍，跳起了战斗的舞蹈，向来自越南南方的英雄们致敬。
    据新华社上海十三日电　上海市革命委员会今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎站在反美斗争最前线的亲密战友——由战斗英雄黄文旦率领的越南南方民族解放阵线代表团。
    上海市革命委员会负责人和中国人民解放军驻上海陆海空三军负责人张春桥、廖政国、王少庸、马天水、梅嘉生、郑长华等以及有关革命群众组织负责人出席了宴会。
    宴会上，充满了中越两国人民的团结战斗气氛。席间，中越两国战友频频举杯，热情洋溢地共祝我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身体健康，共祝越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席以及越南南方民族解放阵线阮友寿主席身体健康，共庆越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的伟大胜利，共祝中越两国人民的兄弟友谊和战斗团结万古长青。

    廖政国同志说，上海人民和全国人民一样，不管有什么狂风暴雨，不管遇到什么惊涛骇浪，都毫不动摇地支援越南人民的正义斗争。
    廖政国同志最后说，越南南方民族解放阵线代表团在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中来到上海访问，这是对我们上海无产阶级革命派和上海人民的莫大支持。
    黄文旦团长在讲话中，对上海军民极其热情的欢迎，表示衷心地感谢。他说，越南南方人民及其唯一真正的代表——以阮友寿主席为首的越南南方民族解放阵线，高度估价兄弟中国人民对越南南方劳动人民的崇高的战斗友谊。我们保证，回到越南南方以后，我们将向越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和全体越南南方军民转达兄弟中国人民的真诚支持和崇高友谊。
