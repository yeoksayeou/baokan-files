Comrade Kang Sheng's speech at the rally welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation in Shanghai, held by the revolutionary people of Shanghai and the three military branches stationed in Shanghai:

Dear Comrade Muhammad Shehu, Dear Comrade Ramiz Alia, Dear members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, Dear members of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Dear revolutionary masses, people's liberation army soldiers, and Red Guards of Shanghai, Comrades and Friends:

With Comrade Muhammad Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, at the head, the Albanian Party and Government Delegation celebrated our National Day with our great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing and then, with revolutionary and militant fraternal feelings, visited various parts of our country. Everywhere they went, our dear Comrade Shehu and Comrade Alia delivered highly friendly speeches, singing the praises of the militant friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania with the greatest enthusiasm, warmly praising Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fully supporting our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This has greatly encouraged our revolutionary people who are in the midst of a revolutionary high tide.

Now, with Comrade Muhammad Shehu at the head, the Albanian Party and Government Delegation has come to Shanghai, the birthplace of our Party, the city with the most concentrated proletariat, and a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The revolutionary masses of Shanghai are overjoyed to hold this grand rally here to give the warmest welcome to our close comrades-in-arms from heroic Albania.

On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I express my heartfelt thanks to Comrade Muhammad Shehu, Comrade Ramiz Alia, and all members of the delegation. I extend cordial greetings and militant salutes to the great leader of the Albanian people and our closest comrade-in-arms, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people.

Comrades and Friends!

The Albanian Labor Party is a tried and tested genuine Marxist-Leninist party, and the Albanian people are a great and upright people.

The Albanian Labor Party, tempered in the revolutionary flames, has produced its great leader and great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Enver Hoxha, in its 26-year glorious history. Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian Labor Party has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the revolutionary practice of their country, leading the Albanian people with the heroic spirit of the proletariat to break through countless difficulties and obstacles, achieving one victory after another. Your fearless, indomitable, and daring spirit to fight against all brutal enemies in the world has won the admiration of the proletariat and revolutionary people worldwide.

The Albanian Labor Party has raised the banner of struggle against imperialism, standing at the forefront of the people's anti-imperialist struggle worldwide. You firmly oppose the aggressive and war policies of imperialism led by the United States, firmly support the just war of the Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation, and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. With great heroism, you have fought against the threats of imperialism and its lackeys head-on, setting a brilliant example for Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary people worldwide.

The Albanian Labor Party has raised the banner of struggle against modern revisionism, waging an irreconcilable struggle against the Khrushchev clique and their successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin, and the Tito renegade clique. You have deeply exposed and criticized modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, firmly supporting Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in various countries, and have made historic contributions to defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and building a socialist society.

The Albanian Labor Party adheres to the principle of self-reliance, implements the mass line, fully mobilizes the wisdom and strength of the people, and has transformed their country from a backward agricultural nation into a socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. Your spirit of striving for progress and hard work is worth our serious study.

The Albanian Labor Party adheres to the dictatorship of the proletariat, carries out class struggle, holds a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, and continuously strengthens and consolidates national defense, making Albania an unshakable socialist bastion.

One year ago, the Albanian Labor Party held its historic Fifth Congress. This congress reviewed the great victories achieved by the Albanian people in their heroic struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism in recent years, formulated a Marxist-Leninist program to guide the country's entire political life based on the new international and domestic situation, and adopted an ambitious Fourth Five-Year Plan. This congress emphasized class struggle, called for further development of the ideological and cultural revolution, and decided to take a series of measures to promote the ideological transformation of the people, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and prevent capitalist restoration.

Under the guidance of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, a nationwide revolutionary movement has been vigorously developing. Comrade Enver Hoxha's programmatic speech on February 6 this year, and the Party Central Committee and government's announcement on April 29, have launched a new high tide of further deepening the revolutionary movement. Opposing bureaucracy, streamlining organizations, and transferring cadres; planned and regular rotation of cadres between the central and grassroots levels; reducing high salaries and narrowing wage gaps; cadres and intellectuals working alongside workers and peasants to directly participate in production; opposing individualism and advocating personal interests subordinate to collective interests; opposing economism and advocating the primacy of political and ideological work; reducing private plots and livestock to further consolidate the socialist position in rural areas; educating the younger generation with revolutionary spirit to go to the mountains and countryside to participate in voluntary labor; eliminating all remnants of discriminatory thoughts against women and thoroughly liberating women; opposing religious superstition and backward customs, promoting atheism; advocating guns and hoes on the stage of literature and art, etc.

Albania's revolutionary movement has enriched the experience of the international proletarian dictatorship. This is a vivid manifestation of the creative application of Marxism-Leninism to the revolutionary practice of their country by the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha.

With the development of the revolutionary movement, the socialist consciousness of the Albanian people has reached an unprecedented height, and the country is full of a vibrant revolutionary atmosphere. The revolutionary movement has powerfully promoted work in all fields. Last year, the Albanian people overfulfilled the industrial production value plan, and agricultural production value reached the highest level since liberation. The call for "realizing agricultural collectivization in mountainous areas" proposed by the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party became a reality in just three months. This is a great victory.

Heroic Albania is carrying out socialist revolution and construction in the midst of encirclement by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries. The enemy is always waiting for an opportunity, observing the situation, and attempting to invade socialist Albania. Recently, at the instigation of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, the ambitious Greek fascist regime attempted to invade the sacred territory of Albania. Comrade Enver Hoxha issued a stern warning to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Greek fascist regime at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people firmly support Comrade Enver Hoxha's solemn declaration. If anyone dares to invade our closest ally, Albania, the 700 million Chinese people will be the strong backing of the Albanian people.

Comrades and Friends!

Over the past year and more, our great leader Chairman Mao has personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, achieving decisive victories. This is the first great revolution initiated by the proletariat itself in a proletarian dictatorship country in the history of the international communist movement. This is a great innovation and a landmark development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao.

The emergence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is not accidental. It is a necessary stage in the deepening development of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a great achievement of Chairman Mao's long-term study and summary of the laws of class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society. The historical experience of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship tells us: the proletariat seizing power is only the beginning of the revolution, not the end. Even after the completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, classes and class struggle still exist. Our great teacher Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: in socialist society, "the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." In recent years, Chairman Mao has repeatedly reminded us, "We must be particularly vigilant against personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev, and prevent such bad people from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at all levels."

The handful of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, are such a group of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship. They are the most dangerous enemies of the proletariat. They use the power they have usurped to vigorously promote capitalism, attempting to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and using open or covert means to try to restore capitalism. Therefore, overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road has become the main task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our struggle with them is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over who will win.

After more than a year of intense struggle, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victories. The situation throughout the country is excellent, better than ever before.

During this visit, we accompanied the Albanian Party and Government Delegation to various places. In Jinan, Qingdao, Dazhai, Taiyuan, Yan'an, and Wuhan, as in Beijing and other places, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, tens of millions of people have been mobilized on an unprecedented scale. Mao Zedong Thought has combined with the broad masses and become a great material force for transforming the world. The command headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev has been completely defeated and collapsed. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of our people has never been so vigorous, the unity of all ethnic groups in our country has never been so close, and the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country has never been so consolidated. This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also a common victory for the two parties of China and Albania and all Marxist-Leninists worldwide!

In this great proletarian cultural revolution that has shaken the world, Shanghai is a place of great revolutionary significance. Our great leader Chairman Mao, in the process of personally initiating and leading this great revolution, has, at several crucial moments, strongly supported the heroic struggle of the revolutionary people of Shanghai and timely issued extremely important instructions to the revolutionary masses of Shanghai and the people of the whole country, continuously pushing the movement in the country to new heights.

In November 1965, Chairman Mao initiated the criticism of the counter-revolutionary historical play "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" in Shanghai, and the Shanghai "Wenhui Daily" published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the Newly Edited Historical Play 'The Dismissal of Hai Rui'"; then, in March 1966, Chairman Mao issued the battle cry "Overthrow the tyrants, liberate the little devils" here, marking the beginning of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In early January 1967, Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide to a new stage of struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road. Chairman Mao summarized the basic experience of the "January Revolution" as the revolutionary masses uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road. Then, Chairman Mao personally approved the establishment of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. Over the past half year, the broad revolutionary people of Shanghai have high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and made new contributions to the cultural revolution nationwide in carrying out revolutionary criticism, implementing revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, implementing Chairman Mao's traditional cadre policy, educating old cadres and helping new cadres, and promoting production while carrying out the revolution.

On the eve of the National Day this year, in the unprecedented good revolutionary situation, Chairman Mao inspected the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in three major regions of the country and issued a series of extremely important new instructions, such as the working class and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat should further unite. The working class of Shanghai, as the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, immediately took action, responding to Chairman Mao's great call. The new wind of Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly swept across Shanghai and the whole country, greatly promoting the new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

When the storm of the "January Revolution" first swept across Shanghai, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary mass organizations. The Central Committee said in the telegram: "Your series of revolutionary actions have set a brilliant example for the working class and laboring people of the whole country and for all revolutionary masses." The half-year struggle experience has proven that the working class and the broad revolutionary people of Shanghai have continued to strive forward in this direction. The fierce revolutionary struggle has tempered them to be even stronger and braver. They have established new merits for the people.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanghai deeply understand that all victories are achieved by relying on the great thought of Mao Zedong. We hope you will continue to high-hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Under the unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our people across the country must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, high-hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "Criticize selfishness and revisionism," and strive for new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. "Criticize selfishness and revisionism" is our battle program and the fundamental task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The cultural revolution is to criticize revisionism, expose a handful of revisionists who represent the interests of the bourgeoisie. It is to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, i.e., Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, and realize the ideological transformation of the people. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will still need to "criticize selfishness and revisionism." Only in this way can we gradually eliminate bourgeois ideology, prevent capitalist restoration, and make our country advance along the socialist highway towards communism!

In the process of "criticizing selfishness and revisionism," we will further realize revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units. We must love and firmly support the People's Liberation Army, which was personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, and carry out the "support the army and cherish the people" movement. We must seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects.

The U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries, like a group of dying flies and mosquitoes, are cursing the cultural revolution that has sounded their death knell with the most venomous words. Our comrades and friends, especially the fraternal Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people, are singing the praises of our cultural revolution with the greatest enthusiasm. Comrade Enver Hoxha recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is of great significance not only for China but also for all revolutionary factions and the international communist and workers' movement worldwide." "The Albanian people, our Party and government, enthusiastically support and warmly welcome the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. We regard it as the greatest victory of our brotherly Chinese people after the armed revolutionary victory that led to the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, as our victory and the victory of all revolutionary peoples worldwide, and as a brilliant victory of Marxism-Leninism." The enthusiastic praise and high evaluation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country by the Albanian Labor Party and people are a great encouragement and support for the revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of our country. We will surely not disappoint the expectations of the fraternal Albanian people and the revolutionary people of the world, resolutely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, advance with victory, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making our due contributions to the international communist movement.

Comrades and Friends!

The current international situation is favorable for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries and unfavorable for imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the oppressed peoples and nations worldwide. New Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations are constantly emerging, developing, and growing stronger. The national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, and the flames of people's armed struggles are burning across Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation has achieved great victories. U.S. imperialism is in trouble both internally and externally, with numerous contradictions. The treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is further exposed. On a global scale, the lines between revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution, are becoming clearer. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries are deepening and developing.

The practice of the anti-revisionist struggle over the past few years has shown that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. To oppose imperialism, one must raise the revolutionary banner of opposing modern revisionism and mercilessly expose and criticize modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership. Only by thoroughly exposing them and eliminating them can we thoroughly defeat the ferocious imperialist wolves. We are confident that the true Communist Party members of the Soviet Union trained by Lenin and Stalin, and the great Soviet people, will unite under the banner of the great October Revolution, following the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, and thoroughly defeat the handful of imperialist lackeys and traitors of the proletariat, allowing the revolutionary banner of Leninism to fly high in the sky of Moscow again.

The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique and their faithful lackeys have been plotting to convene a counter-revolutionary black meeting against China, Albania, and Marxism-Leninism. Now, these traitors of the October Revolution are attempting to use the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to cover up their treacherous faces of surrendering to U.S. imperialism and betraying the world's revolutionary peoples and plan to convene a counter-revolutionary black meeting under the pretext of celebrating the October Revolution. This is the most shameless desecration of the October Revolution and the great Lenin. The traitors of the October Revolution opposing us precisely proves that we have inherited the glorious tradition of the October Revolution and the great cause of Lenin.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The truth of Marxism-Leninism is on our side. The international proletariat is on our side. The oppressed nations and peoples are on our side. More than 90% of the people of the world are on our side. Our friends are all over the world. We are not afraid of being isolated, and we will never be isolated. We are invincible."

Comrades and Friends! The revolutionary friendship and militant unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania were personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. They are truly built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, with historical and social roots.

Our two peoples have long suffered from the bullying, exploitation, and oppression of imperialism. We both harbor deep hatred for imperialism and have the deepest sympathy for the oppressed nations and peoples.

Our two parties were established after the October Revolution, following the revolutionary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism, and are genuine proletarian revolutionary parties.

Our two parties have no tradition of social democracy, no tradition of the parliamentary road, and firmly adhere to the Marxist-Leninist theory of seizing power by armed force. Our two parties have been engaged in armed struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies since their establishment and have grown stronger in the process.

Our two parties have led their peoples to rely on long-term armed struggle to liberate themselves.

Our two parties were the first to oppose Khrushchev revisionism and have been fighting side by side consistently.

Our two parties adhere to the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the socialist road. Our two parties believe that class struggle exists in socialist society and must take revolutionary measures to prevent capitalist restoration and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

All these factors ensure the continuous victory of the revolutionary cause of our two parties and countries and the continuous strengthening and development of our friendship and militant unity.

The friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania have been tested by storms and are indestructible and eternal. Our friendship is a model of the relationship between fraternal parties, fraternal countries, and fraternal peoples.

We are pleased to note that in recent years, the exchanges between the two parties and countries of China and Albania in the fields of politics, military, economy, and culture have been increasing. The all-round friendly and mutually beneficial cooperative relations between our two parties and countries are continuously developing and consolidating. Last April and May, Comrade Muhammad Shehu led the Albanian Party and Government Delegation to visit China, and in June, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Albania, further developing the friendship between the two parties and countries. Chairman Mao's telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's high evaluation of Sino-Albanian friendship have pushed the great friendship and unity between our two parties and peoples to a new height. The visit of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu to our country has made new and significant contributions to further strengthening Sino-Albanian friendship. The continuous strengthening of the friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania is of great significance for promoting the development of Marxist-Leninist forces in various countries and achieving greater victories in the international proletarian revolutionary cause and the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggles of the peoples of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The peoples of China and Albania unite, all Marxist-Leninists unite, all revolutionary peoples of the world unite, and overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. A new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation will definitely be established." The Chinese people will surely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, fight shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Albanian people and all revolutionary peoples of the world, and strive to accomplish this glorious and great historical task!

Finally, let us shout:

Long live the unity of the proletarians of the world! Long live the unity of the proletarians with the oppressed peoples and nations!

Long live the revolutionary friendship and militant unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the heroic Albanian people!

Long live the strong People's Republic of Albania!

Long live the glorious Albanian Labor Party!

Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the closest comrade-in-arms of the Albanian people!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

　　康生同志在上海革命人民和驻沪三军欢迎阿党政代表团大会上讲话
　　阿尔巴尼亚是不可动摇的社会主义堡垒
    恩维尔·霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上，对美帝、苏修和希腊法西斯当局提出了严厉警告。中国共产党和中国人民坚决支持这一严正声明。如果谁胆敢侵犯我国最亲密的盟友阿尔巴尼亚，七亿中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。
    新华社上海十一日电　康生同志在上海革命人民和驻沪三军欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的穆罕默德·谢胡同志，亲爱的拉米兹·阿利雅同志，亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志们，上海市革命委员会全体同志们，上海市革命群众、人
  民解放军指战员和红卫兵战友们，同志们，朋友们：
    以阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，在北京同我们伟大领袖毛主席一起欢度了我国国庆节，又带着革命的战斗的深情厚谊，到我国各地进行友好访问。每到一地，我们亲爱的谢胡同志和阿利雅同志，都发表了极为友好的讲话，以最大的热情歌颂中阿两党、两国和两国人民的战斗友谊，热烈赞扬毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全力支持我国无产阶级文化大革命，大大鼓舞了正处在革命高潮中的我国革命人民。
    现在，以穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，来到我党的诞生地，我国工人阶级最集中的城市，具有光荣革命传统的上海。上海的革命群众，怀着万分喜悦的心情，在这里举行隆重的集会，最热烈地欢迎来自英雄阿尔巴尼亚的亲密战友。
    我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向穆罕默德·谢胡同志、拉米兹·阿利雅同志，向代表团全体同志，表示最衷心的感谢，向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的最亲密的战友恩维尔·霍查同志，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民，致以亲切的问候和战斗的敬礼。
    同志们，朋友们！
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是久经考验的真正的马克思列宁主义的党，阿尔巴尼亚人民是顶天立地的伟大的人民。
    在革命烈火中锻炼成长起来的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在二十六年的光荣的历史中，产生了自己的伟大领袖、伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志。以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于本国的革命实践，领导着阿尔巴尼亚人民，以无产阶级的英雄气概，冲破了无数艰难险阻，取得了一个又一个的胜利。你们这种吓不倒、压不垮、敢于同世界上一切残暴敌人作斗争的革命大无畏精神，获得了全世界无产阶级和革命人民的敬佩。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，高举反对帝国主义的战斗旗帜，站在世界人民反帝斗争的最前列。你们坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义战争，坚决支持亚非拉各国人民的革命斗争。你们以大无畏的英雄气概，同帝国主义及其走狗的威胁进行了针锋相对的斗争，为全世界马克思列宁主义政党和革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，高举反对现代修正主义的革命旗帜，同赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流，同铁托叛徒集团，进行了不调和的斗争。你们深刻地揭露和批判了以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，坚决支持各国马克思列宁主义政党和组织，为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，建立了历史性的功勋。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，坚持自力更生的方针，实行群众路线，充分发挥人民群众的智慧和力量，把自己的祖国从一个落后的农业国，建设成为一个具有现代工业和集体化农业的社会主义国家。你们这种奋发图强、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，值得我们认真学习。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，坚持无产阶级专政，开展阶级斗争，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，不断加强和巩固国防事业，使阿尔巴尼亚成为一个不可动摇的社会主义堡垒。
    一年前，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党举行了具有历史意义的第五次代表大会。这次大会，检阅了几年来阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的英勇斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，根据国际国内的新形势，制定了指导国家全部政治生活的马克思列宁主义的斗争纲领，通过了宏伟的第四个五年计划。这次大会，强调阶级斗争，号召进一步开展思想文化革命，决定采取一系列措施，促进人的思想革命化，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。
    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的指引下，阿尔巴尼亚全国群众性的革命化运动轰轰烈烈地发展起来。恩维尔·霍查同志今年二月六日的纲领性讲话，四月二十九日党中央和政府的公告，掀起了进一步深入开展革命化运动的新高潮。反对官僚主义，精简机构，下放干部；中央和基层之间有计划的、经常的轮换干部；降低高工资，缩小工资差别；干部、知识分子同工农一道，直接参加生产劳动；反对个人主义，提倡个人利益服从集体利益；反对经济主义，提倡把政治思想工作放在第一位；减少自留地和自留牲畜，进一步巩固农村社会主义阵地；以革命精神教育青年一代，上山下乡，参加义务劳动；破除一切歧视妇女的旧思想残余，彻底解放妇女；反对宗教迷信和落后习俗，宣传无神论；提倡枪和镐走上文艺舞台，等等。
    阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动，丰富了国际无产阶级专政的经验。这是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用于本国革命实践的生动表现。
    随着革命化运动的开展，阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义觉悟空前提高，全国到处是一片生气勃勃的革命气象。革命化运动有力地推动了各方面的工作。去年，阿尔巴尼亚人民超额完成了工业总产值计划，农业生产总值达到了解放后的最高水平。劳动党第五次代表大会提出的“实现山区农业集体化”的号召，在短短三个月内就变成了现实。这是一个很大的胜利。
    英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，是在帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的四面包围中进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的。敌人时刻都在等待时机，窥测方向，妄图侵犯社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚。最近，在美帝国主义和苏修集团的怂恿下，野心勃勃的希腊法西斯当局，妄图侵犯神圣的阿尔巴尼亚领土。恩维尔·霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上，对美帝、苏修和希腊法西斯当局提出了严厉的警告。中国共产党和中国人民坚决支持恩维尔·霍查同志的严正声明。如果谁胆敢侵犯我国最亲密的盟友阿尔巴尼亚，七亿中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。
    同志们，朋友们！
    一年多来，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。这是国际共产主义运动历史上，在无产阶级专政的国家内，由无产阶级自己发动的第一次大革命。这是一个伟大的创举，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的划时代的新发展。
    无产阶级文化大革命在我国的出现，不是偶然的。这是无产阶级专政条件下阶级斗争深入发展的必然阶段，是毛主席长期以来研究和总结社会主义社会阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争规律的伟大成果。无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们：无产阶级夺取了政权只是革命的开始，而不是革命的结束。即使在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造完成以后，阶级和阶级斗争仍然存在。我们的伟大导师毛主席反复教导我们：在社会主义社会中，“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”近几年来，毛主席一再提醒我们，“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，便是这样一批混进无产阶级专政机构内部的反革命修正主义分子，他们是无产阶级最危险的敌人。他们利用所窃取的权力，拚命鼓吹资本主义，妄想变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，用公开的或隐蔽的手段，企图实行资本主义复辟。这样，打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就成为无产阶级文化大革命的主要任务。我们同他们的斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级谁战胜谁的生死搏斗。
    经过一年多的大搏斗，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已经取得决定性的胜利。全国的形势大好，比过去任何时候都好。
      这次我们陪同阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团到各地访问，在济南、青岛、大寨、太原、延安、武汉，如同我们在北京和其他地方看到的一样，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，亿万群众空前广泛地发动起来了。毛泽东思想同广大群众相结合，变为改造世界的巨大物质力量。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部被打得落花流水，全面崩溃。我国广大人民的革命精神从来没有象今天这样奋发昂扬，我国各族人民从来没有象今天这样亲密团结，我国的无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，也是中阿两党和全世界马克思列宁主义者的共同胜利！
    在这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，上海是一个具有重要革命意义的地方。我们伟大领袖毛主席，在亲自发动和领导这场伟大革命的过程中，在几个重要的关键时刻，都大力支持了上海革命人民的英勇斗争，及时地向上海无产阶级革命派和全国人民发出极为重要的指示，不断地推动全国运动走向新的高涨。
    一九六五年十一月，毛主席在上海发动了对反动历史剧《海瑞罢官》的批判，上海《文汇报》发表了姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》的文章；接着，一九六六年三月，毛主席在这里发出了“打倒阎王，解放小鬼”的战斗号召，揭开了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的序幕。
    一九六七年一月初，毛主席又亲自点燃了上海“一月革命”的熊熊烈火，把全国无产阶级文化大革命推进到向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的新阶段。毛主席总结上海“一月革命”的基本经验，就是无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权。接着，毛主席亲自批准了上海市革命委员会的成立。半年多来，上海广大革命人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，在开展革命大批判方面，在实行革命大联合和革命“三结合”方面，在贯彻毛主席传统的干部政策、教育老干部和帮助新干部方面，在抓革命、促生产方面，都为全国文化大革命作出了新的贡献。
    今年国庆前夕，在空前大好的革命形势下，毛主席视察了全国三个大区的无产阶级文化大革命情况，作出了工人阶级和无产阶级革命派要进一步联合起来等一系列极为重要的最新指示。上海工人阶级不愧为上海无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，他们立即行动起来，响应毛主席的伟大号召。毛主席最新指示的东风，迅速地吹遍了全上海，吹遍了全中国，极大地推动了革命的大批判、革命的大联合、革命的三结合的新高涨。
    当“一月革命”风暴首先在上海掀起的时候，中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命群众组织，发来了贺电。中央在贺电中说：“你们这一系列的革命行动，为全国工人阶级和劳动人民，为一切革命群众，树立了光辉的榜样。”半年多来的斗争经历证明，上海工人阶级和广大革命人民是继续朝着这个方向努力前进的。急风暴雨的革命斗争，把他们锻炼得更坚强，更勇敢。他们为人民立了新功。
    上海广大无产阶级革命派深深懂得，一切胜利的得来，都是依靠了伟大的毛泽东思想。希望你们继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好的形势下，我们全国人民要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“斗私，批修”，争取无产阶级文化大革命的新的胜利。“斗私，批修”，是我们的战斗纲领，是无产阶级文化大革命的根本任务。文化大革命，就是要批判修正主义，揭露一小撮代表资产阶级利益的修正主义者。就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想即马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，破私立公，实现人的思想革命化。在无产阶级文化大革命运动结束以后，我们还是要
  “斗私，批修”。只有这样，我们才能逐步消灭资产阶级思想，防止资本主义复辟，使我们的国家沿着社会主义的康庄大道不断向着共产主义前进！
    我们要在“斗私，批修”中，进一步实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗、批、改。要无限热爱和坚决拥护毛主席亲自缔造的、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，开展“拥军爱民”运动。要抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好。
    美帝国主义者、苏联现代修正主义者和各国反动派，象一群垂死的苍蝇蚊子，正在用最恶毒的辞句咒骂给他们敲响了丧钟的这场文化大革命。我们的同志和朋友，特别是兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，正在以最大的热情歌颂我国文化大革命。恩维尔·霍查同志最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界一切革命派以及国际共产主义和工人运动都具有十分重大的意义。”“阿尔巴尼亚人民，我们党和政府，欢呼和热烈支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命。我们把它看作是兄弟的中国人民继导致一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立的武装革命胜利之后的最伟大的胜利，看作是我们的胜利和全世界一切革命人民的胜利，看作是马克思列宁主义的辉煌胜利。”阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民对我国文化大革命的热情赞扬和高度评价，是对我国无产阶级革命派和革命人民的极大鼓舞和支持。我们一定不辜负兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和世界革命人民的期望，坚决按照毛主席指出的方向，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为国际共产主义运动作出我们应有的贡献。
    同志们，朋友们！
    目前的国际形势，有利于各国人民的革命斗争，不利于帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。毛泽东思想在世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族中，越来越深入人心。新的马克思列宁主义政党和组织不断产生、发展和壮大。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动日益高涨，人民武装斗争的烈火燃遍了东南亚各国。越南人民的抗美救国战争取得了伟大胜利。美帝国主义内外交困，矛盾重重。苏修领导集团的叛徒面目进一步大暴露。在世界范围内，革命和反革命，真革命和假革命，阵线更加分明。世界各国人民的革命斗争正在深入发展。
    几年来反修斗争的实践说明，反帝必须反修。要反对帝国主义，就必须高举反对现代修正主义的革命旗帜，无情地揭露和批判以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。只有彻底揭露他们，把他们清除出去，我们才能彻底战胜穷凶极恶的帝国主义豺狼。我们坚信，列宁、斯大林教养出来的真正的苏联共产党党员和伟大的苏联人民，必将遵照列宁、斯大林的遗训，在伟大的十月革命旗帜下团结起来，把一小撮帝国主义的走狗、无产阶级的叛徒彻底打倒，让列宁主义的革命大旗，重新飘扬在莫斯科的上空。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团和它的忠实走卒，一直在策划召开反华、反阿尔巴尼亚、反马克思列宁主义的反革命黑会。现在这些十月革命的叛徒，竟企图利用庆祝十月革命五十周年，来掩盖他们投降美帝国主义、出卖世界人民革命的叛徒面目，并且打算假借庆祝十月革命的名义来筹划召开反革命黑会。这是最无耻地糟踏十月革命，糟踏伟大的列宁。十月革命的叛徒们反对我们，恰恰证明我们继承了十月革命的光荣传统，继承了伟大列宁的事业。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“马克思列宁主义真理在我们一边。国际无产阶级在我们一边。被压迫民族和被压迫人民在我们一边。全世界百分之九十以上的人民大众在我们一边。我们的朋友遍天下。我们不怕孤立，也绝不会孤立。我们是不可战胜的。”
    同志们，朋友们！中阿两党、两国和两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结，是中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲自缔造的，是真正建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，是有历史的、社会的根源的。
    我们两国人民都曾经长期遭受帝国主义的欺凌、剥削和压迫。我们都对帝国主义怀有无比的仇恨，对被压迫民族和被压迫人民具有最深刻的同情。
    我们两党都是在十月革命后，按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的真正的无产阶级革命党。
    我们两党都没有社会民主党的传统，都没有议会道路的传统，都坚持马克思列宁主义关于武装夺取政权的革命学说。我们两党都是从建立的时候起，就进行反对国内外阶级敌人的武装斗争，并且在武装斗争中发展壮大起来的。
    我们两党都是领导本国人民依靠长期的武装斗争，自己解放自己的。
    我们两党是首先反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义，并且始终如一地并肩战斗的。
    我们两党都坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线，坚持无产阶级专政和社会主义道路。我们两党都认为社会主义社会存在阶级斗争，必须采取革命的措施，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政。
    所有这些，保证了我们两党、两国的革命事业不断胜利前进，保证了我们之间的革命友谊和战斗团结不断巩固和发展。
    中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的友谊和团结，是经过急风暴雨考验的，是牢不可破的，是永恒的。我们之间的友谊，是兄弟党、兄弟国家、兄弟人民之间关系的典范。
    我们十分高兴地指出，近几年来，中阿两党、两国在政治、军事、经济、文化等方面的往来日益增多。我们两党、两国之间全面的友好互助合作关系，正在不断地发展和巩固。去年四、五月间穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国，六月间周恩来总理访问阿尔巴尼亚，进一步发展了两党、两国的友谊。毛泽东主席给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电和恩维尔·霍查同志对中阿友谊的高度评
  价，把我们两党、两国人民之间的伟大友谊和团结，推向了一个新的高峰。以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团这次访问我国，对进一步加强中阿友谊作出了新的重大贡献。中阿两党、两国和两国人民的友谊和团结的不断加强，对于促进世界各国马克思列宁主义力量的发展，争取国际无产阶级革命事业和世界人民反帝反修斗争的更大胜利，具有极其重大的意义。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“中阿两党、两国人民团结起来，全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”中国人民一定遵照毛主席的教导，同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界革命人民并肩战斗，为完成这个光荣伟大的历史任务而奋斗到底！
    最后让我们高呼：
    全世界无产者联合起来！全世界无产者同被压迫人民和被压迫民族联合起来！
    中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的革命友谊和战斗团结万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    坚强的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的最亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的最亲密战友毛主席万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！万岁！万万岁！
