For the publication of Chairman Mao's works, produce more paper and better paper, letting the great Mao Zedong Thought shine red throughout the world. The total production of letterpress paper in the first eight months of the year has caught up with last year's total annual production.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary workers on the front lines of China's paper industry, with boundless love and reverence for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, have earnestly implemented the "grasp revolution, promote production" policy. They have achieved the goal of producing more and better paper, making significant contributions to ensuring the paper needed for printing Chairman Mao's works. In the first eight months of this year, the total production of letterpress paper, mainly used for printing Chairman Mao's works, has equaled last year's annual total, increasing by 61% compared to the same period last year; it has increased by 61% compared to the total annual production of 1965; and it has nearly doubled compared to the total annual production of 1964. The quality of the paper is also whiter and more uniform than before.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary workers in various localities have proudly declared: The letterpress paper we produce is largely used to print Chairman Mao's works, providing the necessary conditions for spreading the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The class enemies are terrified of Mao Zedong Thought. The more they obstruct and resist the printing of Chairman Mao's works and prevent us workers, peasants, and soldiers from mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must strive to produce more letterpress paper for publishing Chairman Mao's works, spreading Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world, and letting the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine red everywhere.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary workers in various localities have, throughout the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consistently held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production." They have vigorously grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production. With boundless indignation, they have exposed and criticized the crimes of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and his agents, Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Zhou Yang, and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, who have done everything in their power to obstruct and resist the printing and publishing of Chairman Mao's works, while printing large quantities of poisonous weeds like "Cultivation of the Self" and various anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black books. At the same time, they have severely criticized the "profit-first" and other revisionist lines implemented by the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and his agents in various regions. Filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, they have resolved to produce high-quality letterpress paper that meets the standards for publishing Chairman Mao's works. They have overcome various difficulties and produced a large quantity of high-quality letterpress paper.

In the past, only four large factories in Liaoning, Jincheng, and Tianjin could produce letterpress paper for printing Chairman Mao's works. To meet the need for mass publishing of Chairman Mao's works, the proletarian revolutionary factions in various paper enterprises have, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, vigorously carried out technological innovations and technological revolutions, sparing no effort to tap into their potential and complete this glorious task. Since this year, in addition to Jincheng and Tianjin Paper Mills completing their state plans for January to August in excess, more than twenty medium and small-sized paper mills in various localities have overcome numerous difficulties and are now able to produce paper for printing Chairman Mao's works.

　　为出版毛主席著作多产纸产好纸让
    伟大的毛泽东思想照红全世界
    全国凸版纸头八个月的总产量赶上去年全年
    新华社十四日讯　我国造纸工业战线上的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想无限崇拜的深厚感情，认真贯彻“抓革命，促生产”方针，做到多产纸，产好纸，为保证印制毛主席著作用纸作出了重要贡献。今年头八个月，全国生产的主要用来印制毛主席著作的凸版纸，相当于去年一年的总产量，比去年同期增长了百分之六十一；比一九六五年全年的总产量增长百分之六十一；比一九六四年全年的总产量增长近一倍，纸张的质量也比过去更加洁白、均匀。
    各地造纸企业的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，豪迈地说：我们生产出来的凸版纸，大量地用来印制毛主席著作，就是为传播威力无比的毛泽东思想提供必要的条件。阶级敌人对毛泽东思想怕得要死，他们越是阻挠和抵制印制毛主席著作，不让我们工农兵掌握毛泽东思想，我们就越是要为出版毛主席著作竭尽全力，生产更多的凸版纸，把毛泽东思想传播到全世界，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想把全世界照得红通通的。
    各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，始终高举革命的批判大旗，遵循毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们以无比愤怒的心情，揭发和批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，通过他的代理人彭真、陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子千方百计地抵制和阻挠印制和出版毛主席著作，而大量印制大毒草《修养》和各种反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑书的罪行。同时，他们还狠狠批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，通过他在各地区的代理人所推行的“利润挂帅”等修正主义路线。他们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，怀着对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的刻骨仇恨，下定决心，要生产出优质的凸版纸，达到毛主席著作出版用纸的标准。他们克服了各种困难，生产出大量优质的凸版纸。
    过去用来印制毛主席著作的凸版纸，全国只有辽宁金城，天津等四个大厂能够生产。为了适应大量出版毛主席著作的需要，各地造纸企业的无产阶级革命派，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大力开展技术革新和技术革命，千方百计地挖掘潜力，完成这项光荣任务。今年以来，除金城和天津造纸厂超额完成一至八月份国家计划外，各地已有二十多个中、小型造纸厂，克服种种困难，能够生产印制毛主席著作用纸了。
