The phrase "money can make the devil grind" sums up the bourgeoisie's philosophy of life. Money, money, money—that's all they care about. In the eyes of these profit-hungry bourgeois elements, there is nothing but money. China's Khrushchev is exactly such a man with dollar signs in his eyes.

Listen! He says: A factory must definitely make money. The main business doesn't make much money, but the sideline does.

Listen again! He says: If every worker earns one yuan, a few voluntary workers can build a cinema. Once the cinema is built, tickets can be sold, and money can be made... Enough, enough, China's Khrushchev talks about money when he opens his mouth and talks about money when he closes it, never mentioning political leadership!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without correct political views, one is like a soul-less body." All our work must emphasize politics and achieve the transformation of people's ideology.

China's Khrushchev's relentless advocacy for "material incentives" and fierce opposition to political leadership is an attempt to corrupt the revolutionary will of our people, open the floodgates for the spread of revisionist ideology, and achieve his evil goal of opposing the revolution and restoring capitalism. The great Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will never allow this conspiracy to succeed.

    钱眼里的先生
    “有钱能使鬼推磨”。钱，钱，钱，这就是资产阶级的人生哲学。在那些唯利是图的资产阶级分子眼里，除了钱，还是钱。中国赫鲁晓夫也就是这样一个钱眼里的先生。
    你听！他说：一个工厂一定要赚钱。正业其实不赚什么钱，副业赚钱。
    你再听！他说：每个工人搞一个工的钱，几个义务工就可以盖一所电影院。电影院盖起来可以卖票，又可以赚钱……够了，够了，中国赫鲁晓夫开口钱，闭口钱，就是不讲政治挂帅！
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”我们一切工作都必须突出政治，实现人的思想革命化。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之所以竭力鼓吹“物质刺激”，拚命反对政治挂帅，就是妄图腐蚀我国人民的革命意志，为修正主义思潮泛滥打开闸门，以达到他反对革命，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民绝不允许这个阴谋得逞。
