	China and Mauritania have issued a joint communique. In the anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist struggle, the two countries will support and assist each other. Both sides resolutely support the courageous struggle of the peoples of African countries for national liberation, resolutely support the struggle of the Arab peoples against the aggression of the United States, Britain, and Israel, and resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. They strongly condemn the heinous crimes of American imperialism in its aggression against Vietnam.

	New China News Agency, October 25 — The People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania have issued a joint communique. At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, a delegation led by President Moktar Ould Daddah of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania visited China from October 20 to October 24, 1967.

	Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, met with President Moktar Ould Daddah and other members of the delegation, and had a cordial and friendly conversation with them.

	During their visit to China, the delegation led by President Moktar Ould Daddah visited people's communes, factories, and schools, and had friendly exchanges with Chinese workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and Red Guards who are triumphantly carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The delegation was warmly welcomed and received with great hospitality by the Chinese government and people. This fully demonstrated the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania.

	Premier Zhou Enlai held talks with President Moktar Ould Daddah. The Chinese side participating in the talks included Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and relevant officials Lin Haiyun, Qi Pengfei, Yang Lin, Lin Zhaonan, Dai Ping, and China's Ambassador to Mauritania, Lü Zhixian.

	The Mauritanian side participating in the talks included delegation members Bilani Mamadou Wane, Ahmed Ould Mohamed Saleh, Mohamed Abdallah Ould El Hassan, Farouq Malik, Abdel Aziz Saleh, Moktar Ould Heiba, Mohamed Abdallah Ould Harich, Hamoud Ould Abdoul Wedoud, Mohamed Lemina Ould Limam, and Mouley El Hassan.

	Both sides had a frank exchange of views on further developing friendly cooperation between China and Mauritania and the current international situation. The talks were conducted in a cordial, friendly, and mutually trusting atmosphere.

	Both sides were pleased to note that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mauritania in 1965, friendly cooperation between the two countries has been continuously developing.

	Both sides were pleased to review the implementation of the three agreements on economic, trade, and cultural cooperation signed in February this year between Mauritanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Planning Bilani Mamadou Wane and the Chinese side, and decided to further develop cooperation between China and Mauritania in various fields.

	Both sides believed that in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, the peoples of the two countries should support and assist each other.

	Both sides unanimously expressed their resolute support for the courageous struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Angola, South Africa, and other African countries still under colonial rule for national liberation. Both sides strongly condemned the racial discrimination policies of the colonial regimes in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, and also condemned racial discrimination existing in other parts of the world.

	Both sides unanimously expressed their resolute support for the struggle of the Arab peoples to maintain their sovereignty and territorial integrity and to resist the aggression of American and British imperialism and their tool, Israel. Both sides are confident that the Arab peoples will surely achieve final victory.

	Both sides discussed the Vietnamese issue with concern.

	The Chinese side pointed out that American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the most ferocious enemy of the peoples of the world. The heroic Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation is giving great support and encouragement to the revolutionary peoples of the world. The Chinese government and people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their war of resistance against American aggression to the end. At present, the United States, the Soviet Union, and their followers are hatching new "peace talks" plots and are attempting to use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnamese issue, which is absolutely unacceptable. The Vietnamese issue must be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves.

	The Mauritanian side reiterated its resolute support for the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people, strongly condemned the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in Vietnam and continuing to be committed, and firmly believed that the Vietnamese people will surely win final victory.

	Premier Zhou Enlai expressed support for the non-aligned policy pursued by the Mauritanian government and praised Mauritania's just stance in severing relations with Britain and the United States to support the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and the Arabs.

	The Mauritanian side reiterated its firm support for the restoration of China's lawful rights in the United Nations; firmly advocated the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and opposed any plot to create "two Chinas." Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government, expressed thanks for this.

	President Moktar Ould Daddah expressed that Mauritania is deeply sympathetic to the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of their wise and popular leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and sincerely wished the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China a thorough victory.

	President Moktar Ould Daddah invited Premier Zhou Enlai to lead a Chinese government delegation to visit Mauritania at an appropriate time. Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his pleasure in accepting President Moktar Ould Daddah's invitation. The time of the visit will be determined through diplomatic channels at a later date.

	Both sides were confident that President Moktar Ould Daddah and the delegation he led had greatly enhanced mutual understanding and trust between China and Mauritania during their state visit to China, which would further consolidate and develop friendly cooperation between the two countries and help strengthen the unity of the Asian and African peoples in their anti-imperialist cause.

	President Moktar Ould Daddah of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania expressed deep gratitude to the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people for the extremely warm welcome and fraternal reception extended to him and his delegation during their visit to China.

	October 24, 1967, Beijing

    应中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来的邀请，由毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国总统莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫阁下率领的毛里塔尼亚代表团于一九六七年十月二十日至十月二十四日在中华人民共和国进行了国事访问。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，会见了莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫总统阁下和代表团其它成员，并同他们进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫总统率领的毛里塔尼亚代表团在中国访问期间，参观了人民公社、工厂、学校，同正在胜利地进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国工人、农民、革命师生和红卫兵们进行了友好的接触。代表团受到了中国政府和中国人民的热烈欢迎和隆重接待。这充分体现了中毛两国人民之间的深厚友谊。
    周恩来总理同莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫总统举行了会谈。中国方面参加会谈的，有李富春副总理，各有关方面负责人林海云、姬鹏飞、杨琳、林兆南、戴平，以及中国驻毛里塔尼亚大使吕志先。
    毛里塔尼亚方面参加会谈的，有毛里塔尼亚代表团成员比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼、艾哈迈德·乌尔德·穆罕默德·萨拉赫、穆罕默德·阿卜杜拉希·乌尔德·埃尔·哈桑、法尔·马立克、阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹·萨勒、莫克塔·乌尔德·海巴、穆罕默德·阿卜杜拉希·乌尔德·哈尔希、哈穆德·乌尔德·阿卜杜勒·韦杜德、穆罕默德·勒米纳·乌尔德·利曼、穆拉耶·埃尔·哈桑。
    双方就进一步发展中毛两国友好合作关系和当前国际形势等问题，坦率地交换了意见。会谈是在亲切友好和相互信任的气氛中进行的。
    双方满意地看到，中、毛两国自一九六五年建交以来，两国之间的友好合作关系日益发展。
    双方满意地回顾了今年二月由毛里塔尼亚外交兼计划部长比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼阁下与中国方面签订的经济、贸易、文化三个协定的执行情况，并决定进一步发展中、毛两国在各个方面的合作关系。
    双方认为，在反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，两国人民应该互相支持，互相帮助。
    双方一致表示坚决支持津巴布韦、莫三鼻给、几内亚（比绍）、安哥拉、南非人民以及还处在殖民统治下的非洲其它各国人民为争取民族解放而进行的英勇斗争。双方强烈谴责南非和南罗得西亚殖民当局的种族歧视政策，同时谴责在世界其它地方存在着的种族歧视。

    莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫总统邀请周恩来总理在适当的时候率领中国政府代表团前往毛里塔尼亚进行国事访问。周恩来总理表示愉快地接受莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫总统的邀请。访问时间将在以后通过外交途径商定。
    双方确信，莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫总统以及由他率领的代表团这次对中国的国事访问，大大增进了中毛两国的相互了解和信任，将进一步巩固和发展两国之间的友好合作关系，并有助于加强亚非人民的团结反帝事业。
    毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国总统对中国政府、中国党和中国人民在他本人和代表团访华期间所给予的极为热情的欢迎和兄弟般的接待，表示深切的感谢。
