The revolutionary workers at Anshan Steel's Gongchangling Iron Mine are resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions. They are helping revolutionary cadres fight their selfish tendencies, boost their morale, and take on heavy responsibilities. The revolutionary production situation is excellent. From January to September, the production of iron concentrate set a new record for the same period since the mine was established.

	The revolutionary workers at Anshan Steel's Gongchangling Iron Mine, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, have followed Chairman Mao's formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to correctly handle relations with cadres. They have helped cadres who made mistakes to fight their selfish tendencies, put down their burdens, boost their morale, and take on heavy responsibilities. They have also actively liberated cadres and boldly used them, working together to seize the revolution and promote production. Both the revolution and production have shown a very good situation. From January to September, the production of iron concentrate increased by 3.1 percent on the basis of last year's breakthrough of the highest historical level, creating a new record for the same period since the mine was established.

	During the Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Anshan Steel Party pushed the reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number," causing most revolutionary cadres to be sidelined. This resulted in the mine lacking a strong leadership core, and both the revolution and production were seriously affected for a short period. The broad revolutionary workers were very anxious and dissatisfied with this situation and demanded that the revolutionary cadres stand up to seize the revolution and promote production together with the revolutionary masses.

	Facing this situation, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in the mine held discussions. Two opinions emerged during the discussion: A minority opposed cadres immediately standing up to participate in the movement and production. Their reason was that the leaders at the middle and above levels in the mine had all made various mistakes and needed a relatively long period of testing; otherwise, if they were liberated incorrectly, it would be detrimental to their organization. The majority disagreed with this view. They believed that after more than a year of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, the masses had a clear understanding of most cadres and should follow Chairman Mao's cadre policy to view cadres comprehensively and historically. They should see that although most cadres had made various mistakes, their essence was good, their major principles were correct, and they had relatively rich experience in struggle and production. Helping them to stand up was not only an urgent need for "seizing the revolution and promoting production" but also more importantly, it could allow the cadres to be tempered in the movement, work, and production, giving them the opportunity to correct their mistakes and promote ideological transformation.

	The broad revolutionary masses in the entire mine were very concerned about this matter and participated in the discussion. The masses strongly supported the active education, liberation, and use of cadres. The revolutionary mass organizations widely absorbed the opinions of the masses and, following the instructions of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin on identifying cadres, provided enthusiastic help and serious examination for the cadres. In the process of seizing the revolution and promoting production, they boldly used revolutionary cadres. In a few months (by the end of September), more than 83 percent of the cadres in the entire mine had been liberated, including some revolutionary leading cadres who participated in the overall leadership of this mine.

	When some cadres first stood up, they still had various concerns: they were afraid that if they worked actively, they would be accused of "grasping at straws"; if they did not work actively, they would be accused of "passive resistance"; they were also afraid that if they made mistakes in their work, they would be criticized again. The PLA comrades timely joined the revolutionary workers to study and analyze these active thoughts. They believed that fear was a manifestation, and "selfishness" was the root. No matter how much they feared, it was all because of the "selfish" character. Therefore, through organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, individual talks, home visits, and other methods, using the "Three Articles" as a weapon, they helped these cadres who stood up to fight a battle of breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in their souls. Many cadres who stood up, with the help of the masses, fought hard against "selfishness" on the battlefield of seizing the revolution and promoting production, achieving very good results. Some cadres deeply felt: "Going to the masses, seizing the revolution and promoting production with the masses is a good opportunity to change one's worldview and a good battlefield for 'fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism.'"

	The revolutionary workers and PLA comrades also paid special attention to supporting revolutionary cadres in seizing the revolution and doing a good job. This further stimulated the cadres' enthusiasm. During the revolutionary criticism campaign throughout the mine, many cadres actively joined in, exposing the crimes of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Anshan Steel Party. In early June, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Anshan Steel Party used extremely vicious means in an attempt to sabotage the revolution and production in the mine, forcing a major mining area to stop producing and transporting ore. Revolutionary cadres actively proposed to focus on transportation, and revolutionary workers immediately held an emergency mobilization meeting, fully supporting the cadres' plan. In a short time, they restored transportation and excellently completed the transportation task.

    鞍钢弓长岭铁矿革命职工坚决遵照毛主席的指示办事
    帮助革命干部斗私心鼓干劲挑重担
    革命生产形势大好。一至九月铁精矿产量创建矿以来同期最新纪录
    本报讯　鞍山钢铁公司弓长岭铁矿的广大革命职工，在驻矿的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席提出的“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，正确对待干部，帮助犯错误的革命干部斗私心、放包袱、鼓干劲，并且积极解放干部，大胆使用干部，齐心协力，抓革命促生产，革命和生产都出现了一派大好形势。一至九月，铁精矿产量在去年突破历史最高水平的基础上，又增长了百分之三点一，创造了建矿以来同期的最新纪录。
    在文化大革命中，鞍钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派推行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，大多数革命干部都靠边站了，使这个矿不能形成坚强的领导核心，在一个短时间内，革命和生产曾受到严重影响。广大革命职工对此十分着急和不满，纷纷要求广大革命干部站出来同革命群众一起抓革命促生产。
    面对这一情况，矿里的革命群众组织的负责人展开了讨论。在讨论中出现了两种意见：少数人不同意干部马上站出来参加运动，参加生产。他们的理由是：矿里的中层以上的领导干部，都犯有这样那样的错误，要经过较长时间的考验，否则，万一解放错了，对自己的组织不利。多数人不同意这种意见，他们认为：经过一年多轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，广大群众对大多数干部心中有底了，应当按照毛主席的干部政策，全面地、历史地看干部。应当看到：大多数干部虽然犯过这样那样的错误，但他们本质是好的，大节是好的，有比较丰富的斗争经验和生产经验，帮助他们站出来，不仅是“抓革命，促生产”的迫切需要，更重要的是可以让广大干部在运动、工作、生产中经受锻炼，给他们改正错误的机会，促进思想革命化。
    全矿广大革命群众，都很关心这件大事，参与了这场讨论。广大群众十分赞成积极教育干部，解放干部，使用干部。革命群众组织广泛吸取了群众的意见，按照毛主席和林副主席关于识别干部的指示，对干部进行了热情的帮助，严肃的考察，并在抓革命促生产中，大胆使用革命干部。几个月来（到九月底止），全矿已有百分之八十三以上的干部被解放出来，其中还有一些革命领导干部参加了这个矿的全面领导工作。
    少数干部刚刚站出来时，还有种种顾虑：积极干工作，怕别人说是“捞稻草”；不积极干，又怕别人说“消极对抗”；还怕工作中出了缺点错误，再次挨整。解放军同志及时同广大的革命职工一起，针对这些活思想，进行研究、分析。他们认为：怕是表现，“私”是根子。千怕万怕，都是“私”字作怪。于是通过举办毛泽东思想学习班、个别谈心、登门访问等方式，以“老三篇”为武器，帮助这些站出来的干部，在灵魂深处打了一场破私立公的仗。许多站出来的干部，以抓革命促生产为战场，在群众的帮助下，狠斗“私”字，取得了很好效果。有的干部深有体会地说：“到群众中去，同群众一起抓革命促生产，是改造世界观的好机会，是‘斗私，批修’的好战场。”
    革命职工和解放军同志，还特别注意支持革命干部抓好革命，作好工作。更加激发了干部的积极性。在全矿开展革命大批判中，许多干部纷纷大杀回马枪，揭发了鞍钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。六月初，鞍钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，使出了极其恶毒的手段，妄图破坏矿里的革命和生产，迫使矿里一个主要矿区生产的矿石运不出去。革命干部积极提出抓好运输的建议，革命职工立即召开紧急动员会议，全力支持革命干部的方案，在很短时间内恢复了运输，出色地完成了运输任务。
