The great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call to action for all primary, secondary, and higher education institutions to immediately resume classes and make revolution has been enthusiastically supported and firmly responded to by revolutionary teachers and students nationwide. They are determined to act with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to immediately resume classes and make revolution, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to complete the great and glorious task of educational revolution proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao.

In his programmatic directive of May 7, 1966, Chairman Mao taught us: "Students are the same. They should focus on learning, while also learning other skills, that is, not only learning literature but also industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue."

Revolutionary teachers and students across the country have expressed their determination to follow the fundamental direction of educational revolution pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, to take "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle, to teach and reform simultaneously, and through repeated practice, to create a brand-new proletarian educational system. They will strive forward to make our schools into bright red Mao Zedong Thought schools!

In recent days, primary, secondary, and higher education institutions in cities and countryside across the country have been filled with joy. The number of schools resuming classes and making revolution is increasing. In the capital, a batch of higher education institutions, including Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Agricultural University, University of Science and Technology of China, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, Beijing Institute of Mining and Technology, Beijing Institute of Physical Education for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Beijing Normal University, China Medical University, Institute of International Relations, Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower, have successively resumed classes and made revolution.

Revolutionary teachers and students in various places have emphasized that to complete this great historical task of educational revolution, we must fully carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit, break through obstacles, and be tenacious. We must take Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution as our weapon, dare to break away from all the old frameworks of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. Many revolutionary teachers in primary, secondary, and higher education institutions that have already resumed classes have pointed out that the teaching reform we are carrying out is a magnificent and great undertaking that no one has ever done before. Although the tasks before us are heavy and the difficulties are many, with the great leader Chairman Mao guiding us, we will definitely be able to break through all obstacles and forge ahead. Revolutionary teachers and students in many schools in Shanghai have expressed their determination to "make a resolution like Yu Gong moving mountains and vow to be pioneers who break through obstacles." They said, "We have the reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts, and the brightest guiding light, Mao Zedong Thought, before our eyes. We will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and complete the glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao." On October 25, revolutionary teacher and student representatives from eight higher education institutions, including Harbin Military Engineering Academy, Harbin Institute of Technology, Heilongjiang University, and Harbin Medical University, exchanged experiences in resuming classes and making revolution. They unanimously agreed that to carry out teaching reform, we must have the fearless revolutionary spirit to break through all old traditions and the tenacious willpower to defy all difficulties.

Many revolutionary teachers and students have emphasized that in the process of teaching reform, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres. The teaching reform plans for resuming classes and making revolution in schools such as Guizhou Normal Academy, Guizhou No. 1 Middle School, and Guizhou Nanxiao Primary School were formulated through repeated discussions from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Revolutionary teachers in some schools in Wuhan and Changsha have deeply felt that in teaching reform, we must follow the mass line, go to the students, first be students, and then be teachers.

Revolutionary teachers and students across the country believe that the important guideline proposed in the editorial of the People's Daily, "Reforming teaching must be combined with teaching practice, conducting teaching while carrying out reform," is a crucial policy for completing this great historical task of teaching reform. On October 25, the preparatory committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee convened a meeting with representatives of primary, secondary, and higher education institutions across the city to discuss the issue of resuming classes and making revolution. They unanimously expressed their determination to take immediate action, with "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle, to teach while reforming, and to implement Chairman Mao's educational thoughts in practice. After resuming classes and making revolution, East China Normal University, in addition to setting up courses for criticism, has also begun to reform professional courses. The school's history department decided to set up a course on party history, taking the struggle between the two lines within the party as the main thread, to severely criticize the revisionist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, and to firmly establish the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They also set up courses on learning industry, agriculture, and military training, and the entire school has shown a new atmosphere of teaching while reforming. Since resuming classes and making revolution in March this year, Tianjin Yan'an Middle School has taken Chairman Mao's May 7 Directive as the highest guideline, mobilized the masses extensively, and launched a vigorous campaign to reform teaching ideas, teaching systems, teaching methods, teacher-student relationships, and teaching materials, achieving good results. Revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 23 Middle School have initially proposed teaching reform plans for subjects such as language, mathematics, physics, and chemistry in the practice of resuming classes and making revolution. After resuming classes and making revolution, middle schools in the Xining region have mobilized the masses, taught while reforming, and adopted the method of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers" in teaching methods. Revolutionary teachers and students respect and help each other, establishing a new type of teacher-student relationship. All primary schools in Jinan that have fully resumed classes have decided to highlight Mao Zedong Thought in teaching content and course settings, and to increase courses in military sports and industrial and agricultural labor.

After studying the editorial of the People's Daily, revolutionary teachers and students in primary, secondary, and higher education institutions in Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, and Kunming have returned to their schools, taken the initiative to repair school buildings and teaching equipment, and compile teaching materials. They expressed their determination to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and to make our schools into revolutionary schools in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

    教学改革必须同教学实践相结合
    各地师生积极复课闹革命探索教学改革方案
    据新华社二十六日讯  伟大领袖毛主席和党中央关于大中小学校都要立即复课闹革命的战斗号召，受到了全国各地广大革命师生的热烈拥护和坚决响应。他们决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，立即复课闹革命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，胜利完成伟大领袖毛主席提出的教育革命的伟大光荣任务。
    毛主席在一九六六年五月七日所作的纲领性指示中教导我们：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”全国广大革命师生纷纷表示，在复课闹革命中，一定要沿着伟大领袖毛主席指出的教育革命的根本方向，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，边教学，边改革，通过反复实践，创造出一个崭新的无产阶级的教育制度，为把我们的学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋勇前进！
    连日来，全国城乡的大中小学校，一片喜气洋洋。各地复课闹革命的学校越来越多。在首都，已经有北京航空学院、北京农业大学、中国科技大学、北京地质学院、北京邮电学院、北京矿业学院、北京工农兵体育学院、北京师范大学、中国医科大学、国际关系学院、北京政法学院、北京林学院、北京水利水电学院等一批高等院校，陆续复课闹革命。
    各地革命师生强调指出，为了完成教育革命这个伟大历史任务，一定要充分发扬大无畏的革命精神，披荆斩棘，坚韧不拔，以毛主席的教育革命思想为武器，敢于破除封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的一切旧框框。许多已经开学的大中小学的革命教师指出，我们进行的教学改革，是前人从来没有做过的豪迈伟大事业。虽然摆在我们面前的任务很重，困难很多，但是有伟大领袖毛主席给我们指引航道，我们一定能够冲破一切障碍，勇往直前。上海许多学校的革命师生表示，一定要“立下愚公移山志，誓做披荆斩棘人”。他们说，我们心中有最红最红的红太阳毛主席，我们面前有最亮最亮的指路明灯毛泽东思想，我们一定能战胜一切困难，完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。哈尔滨军事工程学院、哈尔滨工业大学、黑龙江大学、哈尔滨医科大学等八所高等学校的革命师生代表在二十五日座谈交流复课闹革命的经验时，一致认为，要搞好教学改革，必须有冲破一切旧传统的大无畏的革命精神，必须有藐视一切困难的坚韧不拔的毅力。
    许多地方的革命师生着重表示，在改革教学的过程中，一定要相信群众，依靠群众，充分发挥革命师生和革命干部的积极性和创造性。贵阳师范学院、贵阳一中、贵阳南郊小学等学校，复课闹革命和教学改革的方案，都是从上到下，从下到上，经过群众反复讨论以后制定出来的。武汉、长沙一些学校的革命教师也深深地体会到，在教学改革中，一定要走群众路线，到学生中去，先做学生，后做先生。
    各地广大革命师生认为，《人民日报》社论提出的“改革教学，必须同教学实践相结合，一边进行教学，一边进行改革”，这是完成教学改革这一伟大历史任务的一条重要方针。内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组二十五日召集全市大中小学校革命师生代表讨论了复课闹革命的问题，他们一致表示要立即行动起来，以“斗私，批修”为纲，一边教学，一边改革，在实践中贯彻毛主席的教育思想。华东师范大学在复课闹革命以后，除开设了大批判课以外，对专业课也着手进行改革。这个学校的历史系决定开设党史课，以党内两条路线的斗争为纲，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义路线，大立以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们还开设了学工、学农和军事训练课，全校出现了边教学，边改革的崭新气象。天津延安中学从今年三月份复课闹革命以来，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高纲领，广泛发动群众，展开了轰轰烈烈的改革教学思想、改革教学体制、改革教学方法、改革师生关系和改革教材的“五改”活动，收到了很好的效果。北京二十三中的革命师生，已在复课闹革命的教学实践中，初步提出了语文、数学、物理、化学等学科的教学改革方案。西宁地区的中等学校在复课闹革命以后，放手发动群众，一边教学，一边改革，在教学方法上采取了“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的方法，革命师生互相尊重，互相帮助，建立了新型的师生关系。已经全面开学的济南市各小学，决心在教学内容和课程设置上都突出毛泽东思想，并且增加军事体育和工农业劳动等课程。
    天津、郑州、兰州、昆明等地大中小学校的革命师生，学习了《人民日报》社论以后，纷纷回到学校，自己动手整修校舍和教学设备，选编教材。他们表示，一定要发扬自力更生的精神，把我们的学校办成抗大式的革命学校。
