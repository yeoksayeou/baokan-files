The Congolese (Brazzaville) side participating in the talks included: Central Committee members of the National Revolutionary Movement Gabriel Bouka and Felix Taty-Gustave, Minister of the Interior and Post and Telecommunications Andre Ombesa, Special Commissioner of the Prime Minister's Office Auguste Tchouvou, and General Commissioner of Planning Jean-Michel Monbounou.

Both sides held talks on further developing the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries and international issues. The talks were conducted in a friendly, cordial, and mutually trusting atmosphere.

Both sides are pleased to note that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, especially since the visit of President Alphonse Massamba-Débat to China in 1964, the friendly relations between the two peoples and the friendly cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields have been continuously strengthened and developed. Both sides believe that the peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville) should support each other in their just struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys. Both sides expressed their determination to further strengthen and develop the fraternal friendship and cooperative relations between the two countries.

The Chinese side highly praises the great victory of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people's August 1963 revolution. The Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the Congolese (Brazzaville) people in their struggle to maintain national independence and sovereignty against the imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, and firmly support the efforts of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people to eliminate colonialist forces and develop the national economy. The Chinese side expressed respect for the non-aligned policy pursued by Congo (Brazzaville) in international affairs.

The Congolese (Brazzaville) side highly praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and condemns all the slanders and libels by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices against the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

Both sides resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, condemn the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in this region, and believe that the U.S. aggressor troops and their mercenary troops must be completely withdrawn from South Vietnam, and the Vietnamese problem can only be solved by the Vietnamese people themselves.

Both sides are convinced that Premier Alphonse Massamba-Débat and the delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement and the Government of Congo (Brazzaville) led by him have further strengthened and developed the friendship between the peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville) and the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries through this friendly visit to China, and have further promoted the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa.
