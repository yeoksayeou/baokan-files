The East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe of the People's Republic of China, carrying the deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Japanese people and the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, arrived in Japan for a visit and performance. On the evening of the 13th, the troupe held a grand opening ceremony and a welcoming performance in Tokyo.

As the performance began, the stirring song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" filled the air. A propaganda team led by a red flag and carrying Chairman Mao's works appeared on stage, and the audience burst into enthusiastic applause. As the song continued, a radiant portrait of Chairman Mao appeared on the backdrop, and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the auditorium, accompanied by thunderous applause that made the hall tremble.

That night, the Chinese acrobats performed a series of acts that expressed the boundless love of the Chinese people for the great leader Chairman Mao, celebrated the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and enthusiastically spread the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The performance by the East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe enthusiastically praised the new spirit and revolutionary style of the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who serve the people wholeheartedly. It reflected that the Chinese acrobatic art born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution follows Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for literature and art.

At the end of the performance, the China-Japan Friendship Association (orthodox), the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japan External Trade Organization, and the Tokyo Chinese Chamber of Commerce jointly presented the troupe with a large red flag embroidered with golden characters: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

The East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe performed four consecutive shows at the Hibiya Theater in Tokyo on the 14th and 15th, with nearly 10,000 Japanese audience members watching the new Chinese acrobatic art created during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the performance, whenever the announcer recited Chairman Mao's quotations and the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao appeared on the backdrop, the entire audience would be in a state of excitement. The audience repeatedly shouted together with the performers: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

Many Japanese friends, after watching the performance, enthusiastically praised the new Chinese acrobatic program created during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a people's art. They said that the East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe is a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "Every program shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought." "The East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe has brought us the great Mao Zedong Thought!"
