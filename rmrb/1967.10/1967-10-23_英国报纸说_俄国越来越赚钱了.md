	The British newspaper *Yorkshire Post* published an article on July 15th, praising the Soviet revisionists' "new system" of profit-driven policies and heaping praise on the Soviet leader Kosygin. The summary of the article is as follows:

	Russia is making more money. Academician Fedlin told the British Institute of Management in London that in 1966, the profits of 3,600 enterprises operating under the new economic reform principles increased by 25%. Excellent! If it is pointed out that 3,600 enterprises are only a small part of Russia's industry, and that a 25% increase in profits is not particularly remarkable, it might somewhat affect the impact. The key is the principle—that only profitable enterprises are practical, and only incentives can make profits. Russia is now generally acknowledging this and gradually putting it into practice.

	Russia's industry must produce more automobiles, more motorcycles, and more and better various consumer goods. An early decision by the Soviet government said so. Premier Kosygin is known as a practical person who has a genuine interest and capability in economic management. It is said that he believes that more emphasis should be placed on the production of consumer goods, and less on the production of heavy industrial equipment and armaments.

	In Russia and the Eastern European communist countries, the economy is beginning to take precedence over politics in a powerful and influential way. This fact has immeasurable significance. What is beginning to happen is a revolution within communism. The structure that may emerge from this might still call itself communism, but since the Communist Manifesto, communism has set standards for itself that will not recognize such a structure.

    英国报纸说
    “俄国越来越赚钱了”
    英国《约克郡邮报》七月十五日刊登了一篇文章，为苏修推行利润挂帅的“新体制”拍手叫好，对苏修头目柯西金备加赞扬。文章摘要如下：
    俄国越来越赚钱了。费德林院士对伦敦的英国管理学院说，在一九六六年，根据新的经济改革原则经营的三千六百个企业的利润增加了百分之二十五。真好！如果要指出三千六百个企业只是俄国工业中的一小部分，利润增加百分之二十五并不是如何惊人的话，那可能会有些影响其效果。要紧的是原则——只有赚钱的企业是实用的、只有刺激才能获利的这种提法。俄国现在开始普遍地承认这一点，并逐渐付诸实施。
    俄国工业必须生产更多的小轿车，更多的摩托车，更多和更好的各种各样的消费品。今年早些时候苏联政府的一个决定就这样说过。柯西金总理以一个对经济管理工作有爱好和真正能力的实用主义者而闻名。据说他认为，应该更多地强调消费品的生产，而较少地强调重型工业装备和军备的生产。
    在俄国和东欧共产党国家，经济正在取代政治占优先和有力地位。这个事实具有无法估计的重要意义。正在开始进行的事情是共产主义内部的一次革命。从而将产生的结构可能仍旧自称为共产主义的，可是自从马克思的共产党宣言以来，共产主义为它自己所确定的标准将不会承认这种结构。
