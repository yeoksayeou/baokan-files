The Indonesian Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is the political representative of the most reactionary classes in Indonesia—the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie and the feudal landlord class. This regime is the most reactionary and decadent in Indonesian history, a lackey of U.S. imperialism, a counter-revolutionary ally of Soviet revisionism, the most savage executioner of the Indonesian people, the most shameless betrayer of national interests, and the sworn enemy of the Indonesian people.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique has long been in the pay of U.S. imperialism, colluding with Soviet revisionism, and stubbornly pursuing anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people counter-revolutionary policies. It has consistently opposed the Indonesian people's revolution and sabotaged their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles. Over the past decade, the main instigators of the anti-China and anti-Chinese movements in Indonesia have been this reactionary military clique. Due to their extreme political reactionism, Suharto and Nasution have been dubbed the "Indonesian Chiang Kai-shek" and the "Brown-skinned Pentagon General."

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique is itself a clique of bureaucratic comprador capitalists. Many of its key members, including its leaders Suharto and Nasution, have dual identities as reactionary military figures and bureaucratic comprador capitalists. For a long time, this reactionary military clique has used its power to usurp the fruits of the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist struggle, control the lifeblood of the Indonesian national economy, and seize the opportunity to develop bureaucratic comprador capital, establishing a thoroughly rotten reactionary "economic dynasty."

This reactionary military clique has used its power to engage in the evil deeds of developing bureaucratic comprador capital for over a decade. Between 1957 and 1960, when the Indonesian people launched a wave of anti-imperialist struggles and took over Dutch imperialist enterprises in Indonesia, this reactionary military clique took the opportunity to extend its black hands everywhere, and the activities of developing bureaucratic comprador capital intensified greatly. The reactionary military clique led by Nasution, who was then the defense minister, used the "emergency state law" as a cover to seize hundreds of Dutch enterprises that had been taken over by the people. They sent hundreds of right-wing officers to seize key positions such as managers and deputy managers in these enterprises. In this way, this reactionary military clique controlled more than half of the country's large plantations, took over the largest oil company operated by Indonesians and most of the state-owned trading companies, monopolized Indonesia's import and export trade, as well as shipping and maritime transportation, and extended its black hands into various sectors of Indonesia's industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation.

This reactionary military clique, having seized control of the lifeblood of the Indonesian national economy, has been engaged in extensive sell-out activities. They have colluded with imperialism led by the United States, acting as agents of imperialist monopolies in Indonesia, providing imperialism with raw materials produced in Indonesia, and pushing industrial products for imperialism in Indonesia, further turning Indonesia into a source of raw materials and a market for imperialist goods, subjecting the Indonesian people to even more brutal imperialist exploitation. This reactionary military clique has made a fortune from these sell-out activities, and many of its members have become "millionaires" and "multi-millionaires." Suharto and Nasution have thus become bureaucratic comprador capitalists with large amounts of capital; Nasution's capital alone amounts to several thousand dollars. One of Nasution's henchmen, the right-wing military figure and general manager of the Indonesian "state-owned oil company," Ibnu Sutowo, is a big profiteer and has become a major figure in the Indonesian bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique is also a clique of feudal landlords. This reactionary military clique has close ties with the feudal landlord class in various rural areas of Indonesia, and many of its members are themselves large landlords. To consolidate the landlord class's rule over the peasants, this clique has sent batches of retired soldiers to the countryside over the past few years to establish so-called "rural construction soldier organizations" and "civil defense" organizations to serve the landlord class. This reactionary military clique also frequently sends troops to brutally suppress peasant masses in various places who are fighting against the rule of the landlord class. The history of the rise of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique is a history of suppressing the peasant movement.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique staged a counter-revolutionary coup in October 1965, establishing the most brutal fascist military dictatorship in Indonesian history. The series of retrograde actions taken by this regime in the past two years have exposed its extremely reactionary nature as the political representative of the Indonesian bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie and the feudal landlord class. As soon as this reactionary regime took power, it raised the butcher's knife against the broad revolutionary people of Indonesia, massacring tens of thousands of Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters, throwing a large number of the finest sons and daughters of the Indonesian people into prison, and turning the beautiful archipelago into a grim hell on earth. This reactionary regime sent thousands of reactionary military personnel to seize the positions of governors in almost all provinces, half of the county magistrates, and many village heads, forming a united front with local feudal forces, robbing and plundering, running amok, seizing peasant land, and intensifying feudal exploitation and brutal suppression of the peasants.

This reactionary regime has further intensified its policy of selling out to imperialism by opening the door to imperialism, returning the enterprises of U.S. and British imperialism in Indonesia, which the Indonesian people had taken over in their anti-imperialist struggle, to these imperialists. Through one "law" after another, it has opened the door wide for the monopolies of the United States, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, and France to pour into Indonesia, handing over the oil, copper, nickel, tin, gold, and forest resources of Java's coastal areas, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and West Irian to imperialism. It is this regime that has kowtowed to U.S. imperialism, colluded with Soviet revisionism, betrayed Indonesian national interests, and returned to the United Nations, stopped opposing the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia," and turned to ally with "Malaysia." This reactionary regime has eagerly served as the vanguard of the U.S. and Soviet revisionist anti-China forces, actively plotting and organizing the anti-China military alliance—the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations"; at the same time, it has repeatedly and madly whipped up anti-China and anti-Chinese hysteria, not hesitating to damage relations between Indonesia and China. The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has committed countless crimes in the two years since it came to power, and its ugly face as the political representative of the Indonesian bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, feudal landlord class, and imperialist lackey has been fully exposed.

Over forty years ago, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, pointed out in "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society": "In economically backward semi-colonial China, the landlord class and the comprador class are completely appendages of international capitalism, and their survival and development are dependent on imperialism. These classes represent China's most backward and most reactionary production relations, obstructing the development of China's productive forces. They are completely incompatible with the goals of the Chinese revolution. In particular, the large landlord class and the large comprador class always stand on the side of imperialism and are extreme counter-revolutionaries."

The Indonesian fascist military clique led by Suharto and Nasution and its regime represent the most backward and most reactionary production relations in Indonesia, obstruct the development of Indonesia's productive forces, and always stand on the side of imperialism as extreme counter-revolutionaries. Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people have clearly pointed out: this fascist regime is their sworn enemy, and the primary task of the Indonesian revolution in the current stage is to overthrow this counter-revolutionary regime through revolutionary armed struggle, overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in Indonesia, achieve people's democratic dictatorship, and build a completely independent and democratic new Indonesia.

    反动阶级的总代表　屠杀人民最凶恶的刽子手　民族利益最无耻的出卖者
    印尼法西斯政权是印尼人民不共戴天的死敌
    新华社二十八日讯  本社记者述评：印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，是印尼最反动的阶级——官僚买办资产阶级和封建地主阶级在政治上的总代表。这个政权是印尼历史上最反动、最腐朽的政权，是美帝国主义的走狗，是苏联修正主义的反共同盟军，是屠杀印尼人民的最凶恶的刽子手，是印尼民族利益的最无耻的出卖者，是印尼人民不共戴天的死敌。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团长期以来投靠美帝国主义，勾结苏联修正主义，顽固推行反华、反共、反人民的反革命政策。它一贯反对印尼人民革命，破坏印尼人民的反帝反殖斗争。近十多年来在印尼出现的历次反华排华逆流，主要是由这个反动军人集团策动的。由于政治上的极端反动，苏哈托和纳苏蒂安被人们叫做印尼的蒋介石和“棕色皮肤的五角大楼将军”。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团，本身就是一个官僚买办资本家的集团。这个集团的一些重要成员，包括它的头目苏哈托、纳苏蒂安在内，都具有反动军人和官僚买办资本家的双重身份。长期以来，这个反动军人集团利用职权，篡夺印尼人民的反帝斗争果实，控制了印尼的国民经济命脉，乘机发展官僚买办资本，建立了一个腐朽透顶的反动“经济王朝”。
    这个反动军人集团利用职权，十多年来一直进行着发展官僚买办资本的罪恶勾当。在一九五七年到一九六○年间，当印尼人民掀起反帝斗争怒潮，奋起接管荷兰帝国主义在印尼的企业时，这个反动军人集团乘机到处伸出黑手，发展官僚买办资本的活动大大加剧。以当时窃踞国防部长职务的纳苏蒂安为首的反动军人集团，利用“战时掌权者”的地位，以“紧急状态法令”为掩护，把由人民接管的几百家荷兰企业据为己有。他们派出了几百名右派军官，窃取了这些企业的经理、副经理等要职。这样，这个反动军人集团便控制了全国半数以上的大种植园，掌握了由印尼人经营的最大的石油公司和大部分国营贸易公司，垄断了印尼的进出口贸易以及航运和海运等交通工具，把黑手伸进了印尼的工业、农业、商业和交通运输各部门。
    这个反动军人集团霸占了印尼国民经济命脉，大肆进行卖国活动。他们勾结以美国为首的帝国主义，充当帝国主义垄断资本在印尼的代理人，为帝国主义提供印尼出产的原料，为帝国主义在印尼推销工业品，把印尼进一步变为帝国主义的原料产地和商品市场，使印尼人民遭到帝国主义更加残酷的盘剥。这个反动军人集团就在这些卖国活动中大发横财，他们中间不少人一跃而为“百万富翁”、“千万富翁”。苏哈托和纳苏蒂安都这样成了拥有大量资本的官僚买办资本家，纳苏蒂安拥有的资本达几千万美元；纳苏蒂安的爪牙、右派军人、印尼“国营石油公司”的总经理伊布努·苏托沃，是一个大暴发户，成为印尼官僚买办资产阶级的一个大头目。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团同时又是一个封建地主的集团。这个反动军人集团与印尼各地农村的封建地主阶级有着千丝万缕的联系，它的不少成员本身就是大地主。为了巩固地主阶级对农民的统治，这个集团几年来派遣大批退伍军人到农村，建立所谓“农村建设官兵组织”和“民防”组织，为地主阶级效劳。这个反动军人集团还经常派遣军队，对各地为反抗地主阶级的统治而进行斗争的农民群众，进行残暴镇压。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团的发家史，就是一部镇压农民运动的历史。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团在一九六五年十月发动了反革命政变，建立了印尼历史上空前残暴的法西斯军人的独裁政权。这个政权两年以来的一系列倒行逆施，赤裸裸地暴露了它作为印尼官僚买办资产阶级和封建地主阶级在政治上的总代表的极端反动的本质。这个反动政权一上台就向印尼广大革命人民挥动屠刀，杀害了几十万印尼共产党人和革命志士，把大批印尼人民的优秀儿女投入监狱，把美丽的千岛之国变成了一座阴森森的人间地狱。这个反动政权派出数以千计的反动军人，窃踞全国绝大多数省的省长、半数左右县的县长和许多村的村长职务，他们同地方上的封建势力结成一体，打家劫舍，横行霸道，掠夺农民土地，加重对农民的封建盘剥和残酷镇压。
    这个反动政权变本加厉地对帝国主义实行卖国的门户开放政策，把印尼人民在反帝斗争中接管过来的美、英帝国主义在印尼的企业还给这些帝国主义者，并且通过一道又一道的“法令”，为美国、英国、日本、荷兰和法国等帝国主义国家的垄断资本涌进印尼敞开大门，把爪哇沿海、苏门答腊、加里曼丹、苏拉威西、西伊里安等地的石油、铜、镍、锡、金等矿藏和森林资源拱手送给帝国主义。就是这个政权投靠美帝，勾结苏修，背叛印尼民族利益，重新回到联合国，停止对抗新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”，并转到与“马来西亚”结盟。这个反动政权竭力充当美帝、苏修反华的急先锋，积极策划组织反华军事联盟——“东南亚国家联盟”；同时一再疯狂掀起反华排华妖风，不惜破坏印尼和中国的关系。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权上台两年来罪行累累，罄竹难书，它作为印尼官僚买办资产阶级、封建地主阶级的政治代表和帝国主义走狗的丑恶面目已经暴露无遗。
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席四十多年前在《中国社会各阶级的分析》中指出：“在经济落后的半殖民地的中国，地主阶级和买办阶级完全是国际资产阶级的附庸，其生存和发展，是附属于帝国主义的。这些阶级代表中国最落后的和最反动的生产关系，阻碍中国生产力的发展。他们和中国革命的目的完全不相容。特别是大地主阶级和大买办阶级，他们始终站在帝国主义一边，是极端的反革命派。”
    以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的印尼法西斯军人集团和它的政权，就是代表印尼最落后的和最反动的生产关系，阻碍印尼生产力发展，并且始终站在帝国主义一边的极端的反革命派。印尼共产党人和革命人民已经明确地指出：这个法西斯政权是他们不共戴天的死敌，现阶段印尼革命的首要任务，就是通过革命的武装斗争，推翻这个反革命政权，推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在印尼的统治，实现人民民主专政，建立完全独立的民主的新印尼。
