Premier Zhou Holds Grand Reception to Celebrate the 18th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China

Celebrate the Great Victory of Our Country's Cultural Revolution and Wish Long Life to the Great Leader Chairman Mao

Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has truly mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. The great thought of Mao Zedong has been propagated on an unprecedented scale, and the spiritual outlook of the people across the nation has undergone tremendous changes. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed and are now undergoing thorough criticism. The dictatorship of the proletariat in our country has been further consolidated. In accordance with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the policy of "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism," a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is currently sweeping the nation. At present, the situation throughout the world is also excellent. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are growing stronger. The seven hundred million people of China are determined to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys through to the end, to carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end, and to continue to advance the revolutionary cause of the world's people and the international proletariat.

At 7:20 PM, Premier Zhou, accompanied by friends from various countries, entered the brightly lit banquet hall. At this moment, the entire audience stood up, and the applause was deafening. The orchestra played the welcoming music.

The reception began, and the orchestra played the national anthem.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet. He first, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the people of China, extended a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to the friends from various countries who came to visit our country.

Premier Zhou said, "Our great motherland is facing a very good situation. Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has truly mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. The great thought of Mao Zedong has been propagated on an unprecedented scale, and the spiritual outlook of the people across the nation has undergone tremendous changes. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed and are now undergoing thorough criticism. The dictatorship of the proletariat in our country has been further consolidated. In accordance with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the policy of 'criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism,' a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' is currently sweeping the nation."

Premier Zhou said, "Revolution is the locomotive of history." Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" has inspired the boundless enthusiasm of the broad masses of laboring people, and the cause of socialist construction in our country will surely achieve new leaps and bounds.

Premier Zhou said, "At present, the situation throughout the world is also excellent. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are growing stronger. The revolutionary movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also developing. More and more countries are igniting the flames of people's armed struggle. U.S. imperialism is in a state of internal and external turmoil and is having a hard time. The traitorous faces of modern revisionists are becoming increasingly exposed, and they too are having a hard time. Premier Zhou stressed that the seven hundred million people of China are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The historical tide of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world is irresistible. The conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism to counter, oppose, and suppress the revolution will only result in their own downfall and accelerate their failure.

Premier Zhou said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Strive to build a great socialist country and help the broad masses of oppressed and exploited people in the world to fulfill our great internationalist duty.' Premier Zhou said, We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the people of Vietnam in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation until final victory is achieved. We firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. We must unite all Marxist-Leninists in the world, unite all revolutionary people in the world, unite all oppressed peoples and nations, unite all anti-imperialist forces that can be united, form the broadest united front against U.S. imperialism, carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys through to the end, carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end, and continue to advance the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world and the international proletariat."

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was met with thunderous applause from the entire audience.

Before Premier Zhou's speech, three hundred Red Guards, full of vigor and vitality, stood in neat rows on the stage, each holding a red book of revolutionary quotations, and recited Chairman Mao's teachings in unison:

"The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism."

"Marxism-Leninism is on our side. The international proletariat is on our side. The oppressed nations and peoples are on our side. More than ninety percent of the world's people are on our side. Our friends are all over the world."

Following this, the Little Red Guards, filled with boundless love and reverence for our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, with the great ambition to carry the world proletarian revolution through to the end, and with the joy of the greatest victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sang "The Internationale," "The East Is Red," "The People of the World, Unite!," and "The Ship of the Sea Relies on the Helm." When the performance ended, the Red Guards vigorously waved their copies of Chairman Mao's quotations and shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers rolled on without end. The Chinese comrades and international friends in the audience also held up their red copies of Chairman Mao's quotations and waved them in the air, and the hall was instantly filled with a sea of red waves.

The representatives attending the reception were outstanding figures from various fronts. Among them were activists who studied Chairman Mao's works, heroes of battle, and people's liberation army soldiers and officers who had achieved great successes in the "three supports, two military" work, representatives of the revolutionary masses of the people's liberation army stationed in Beijing and the military, revolutionary workers who had achieved remarkable results in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," representatives of the revolutionary masses in the literary and artistic field, scientific and technological personnel and workers who had made outstanding contributions to the economic construction and national defense construction of our country, personnel who had fought bravely against imperialism and revisionism abroad, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao.

Those attending the reception also included responsible comrades from various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and various government departments, responsible comrades from various headquarters, military branches, and military services of the People's Liberation Army, responsible comrades from the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing, as well as representatives from the Workers' Congress, Peasants' Congress, Red Guards' Congress of higher education institutions, and Red Guards' Congress of middle schools in Beijing.

The international friends attending the reception also included friendly delegations from many countries in the political, military, economic, cultural, and folk sectors, as well as famous figures from various fields, experts from various countries who helped our country build socialism, and foreign guests residing in Beijing. Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

The reception was filled with internationalism and friendship from beginning to end. When the reception ended, the orchestra played "The Ship of the Sea Relies on the Helm," and the comrades from various sectors of our country and the international friends waved their red copies of Chairman Mao's quotations, shouting over and over again, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

    招待会开始，乐队奏国歌。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话。他首先代表我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向来我国访问的各国朋友表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    周总理说，我们伟大的祖国面临着一片大好形势。一年多来，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经把亿万革命群众真正发动起来。伟大的毛泽东思想得到了空前未有的大普及，全国人民的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，已经被揭发出来，正在受到彻底批判。我国的无产阶级专政进一步得到巩固。按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，在“斗私、批修”方针的指引下，目前正在全国范围内掀起一个革命大批判、革命大联合、革命“三结合”的新高潮。

    周总理说，当前，全世界也是一片大好形势。马克思列宁主义的队伍正在发展壮大。世界人民特别是亚非拉人民的革命运动也在发展。越来越多的国家燃起了人民武装斗争的烈火。美帝国主义内外交困，日子很不好过。现代修正主义者的叛徒面貌日益暴露，日子也很不好过。周总理强调说，七亿中国人民誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。亚非拉和全世界人民革命斗争的历史潮流，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。美帝国主义和现代修正主义反华、反共、反人民、反革命的阴谋，只会搬起石头打自己的脚，加速他们的失败。
    周总理说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“努力奋斗，建设一个社会主义的伟大强国，并且帮助世界被压迫被剥削的广大人民，完成我们应当担负的国际主义的伟大义务。”周总理说，我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，一直到取得最后胜利。我们坚决支持亚非拉和世界各国人民的革命斗争。我们一定要团结全世界的马克思列宁主义者，团结全世界的革命人民，团结一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，团结一切可以团结的反帝力量，组成最广泛的反对美帝国主义的统一战线，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把世界人民和国际无产阶级的革命事业继续推向前进。
    周恩来总理的讲话，在全场激起了一阵阵暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    在周总理讲话之前，三百名英姿勃勃的红卫兵小将，整齐地排列在主席台上，人人手捧红色革命宝书，齐声朗读毛主席的教导：
    “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
    “马克思列宁主义真理在我们一边。国际无产阶级在我们一边。被压迫民族和被压迫人民在我们一边。全世界百分之九十以上的人民大众在我们一边。我们的朋友遍天下。”
    接着，毛主席的红小兵满怀着对伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情，怀着把无产阶级世界革命进行到底的豪情壮志，带着无产阶级文化大革命取得最大最大胜利的喜悦心情，齐声高唱《国际歌》、《东方红》、《全世界人民团结起来》和《大海航行靠舵手》。表演结束时，红卫兵小将们有力地挥动《毛主席语录》，有节奏地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”欢呼的声浪，滚滚不息。座中的中国同志和国际友人，也把红彤彤的《毛主席语录》举过头顶，在空中挥舞，大厅里顿时呈现出一片红色的波浪。
