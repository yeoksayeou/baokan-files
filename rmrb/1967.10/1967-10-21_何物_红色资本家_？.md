The Chinese Khrushchev deliberately advocates the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," claiming that "capitalists have already handed over their factories" and that "they no longer want to oppose socialism." For this purpose, he has been actively seeking out so-called "red capitalists" to serve as living examples.

Not long after the implementation of the policy of joint public-private ownership of capitalist and commercial enterprises, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai went to great lengths to bring a reactionary capitalist from Shanghai to Beijing to attend the National Political Consultative Conference. The Chinese Khrushchev personally "received" him. At the banquet, the Chinese Khrushchev and this reactionary capitalist were extremely friendly, shamelessly telling this reactionary capitalist that he had led the first major strike at his company. This "reception" instantly boosted the status of this so-called "red capitalist." Under the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, reports, photographs, and films praising this reactionary capitalist were released one after another, making this so-called "red capitalist" extremely popular at the time. The treacherous face of the Chinese Khrushchev at that time aroused the extreme indignation of the broad revolutionary masses of workers. Today, we must thoroughly expose the Chinese Khrushchev's sinister plot to cultivate "red capitalists" in an attempt to restore capitalism.

What kind of person is this reactionary capitalist who was praised by the Chinese Khrushchev as a "red capitalist"?

This "red capitalist," before liberation, sold out his country for personal gain, and had successively hung the stinking signs of "British firm" and "American firm." After the Japanese imperialists occupied Shanghai, he donated three airplanes and a large amount of steel to the Japanese invaders. This "red capitalist" still keeps a photograph personally signed by the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek, given to him when he was a member of the Shanghai puppet legislature. This "red capitalist," in 1949, when the entire city's people were joyfully celebrating the liberation of Shanghai with red flags, drums, and gongs, cursed the Communist Party in his office. This "red capitalist" regarded the joint public-private ownership in 1956 as a "calamity," despairingly lamenting that "decades of hard work had gone to waste." To vent his hatred for socialism, he personally staged a play called "The Bandits of Dongshan," which told the story of bandits from Shandong robbing a wealthy landlord from Guangdong. The implication was clear. At that time, the company's representative from the public sector was from Shandong, and this "red capitalist" was from Guangdong. He used this to launch a vicious attack on our Party, maliciously slandering the Party's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai praised this reactionary action as a "deed" of the "red capitalist," claiming that he "personally staged a play to celebrate the joint public-private ownership" and used him as a model for "peaceful transformation." Soon after, the Chinese Khrushchev brought him to Beijing and personally "received" him.

Under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev, this reactionary capitalist donned a red cloak, and his anti-Party and anti-socialist activities became even more rampant after the joint public-private ownership. He declared that he would preserve the old sign of his company and the old staff, and arrogantly boasted, "The company's sign cannot be lost. As long as I hold onto my power and the original staff remains, the company will be mine again in the future." This truly exposed the wolfish nature of the so-called "red capitalist."

Ironclad facts prove that the Chinese Khrushchev's cultivation of "red capitalists" is driven by sinister intentions. Do you remember that on the eve of national liberation, he was not also actively cultivating a "red capitalist," Song Qinqing, in the Dongya Cotton Mill in Tianjin? The Chinese Khrushchev has always been so enthusiastic and diligent in cultivating "red capitalists." In essence, it is to attempt to restore capitalism in our country. These "red capitalists" are his best social base.

    何物“红色资本家”？
    上海市财革会东方红兵团总部东方红百货商店
    中国赫鲁晓夫别有用心地鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，胡说什么“资本家已经把工厂交出来了”，“他们已经不愿反社会主义了”。为此，他到处物色所谓“红色资本家”作活样板。
    资本主义工商业实行公私合营后不久，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，想方设法把上海的一个反动资本家拉到北京，出席了全国政协会议，中国赫鲁晓夫并亲自“接见”了他。在宴会上，中国赫鲁晓夫与这个反动资本家打得十分火热，恬不知耻地向这个反动的资本家说，你们公司第一次大罢工是我领导的。这次“接见”，使这个所谓“红色资本家”顿时身价百倍。在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，吹捧这个反动资本家的通讯、图片、电影纷纷出笼，使这个所谓“红色资本家”红极一时。当时，中国的赫鲁晓夫这种无耻的叛徒嘴脸激起了我们广大革命职工的无比愤怒。今天我们要彻底揭露中国赫鲁晓夫培养“红色资本家”企图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    被中国赫鲁晓夫吹捧为“红色资本家”的这个反动资本家究竟是个什么东西呢？
    就是这个“红色资本家”，解放前卖国求荣，曾先后挂过“英商”“美商”的臭招牌，日本帝国主义侵占上海后，向日本侵略者捐献三架飞机和大量钢铁。就是这个“红色资本家”，一直保存着他当上海伪参议员时人民公敌蒋介石赠送给他的一张亲笔签名的照片。就是这个“红色资本家”，在一九四九年全市人民兴高采烈地高举红旗敲锣打鼓热烈欢庆上海解放时，他在办公室里咬牙切齿地咒骂共产党。就是这个“红色资本家”，把一九五六年公私合营认为是“浩劫”，绝望地悲叹“数十年心血付之东流”。他为了发泄仇恨社会主义的感情，曾亲自演了一出名叫《东山响马》的戏，内容是说山东强盗抢走了广东财主的财产。寓意是很清楚的。因为当时公司的公方代表是山东人，这个“红色资本家”是广东人。他借此含沙射影地向我们党进行了猖狂进攻，恶毒地污蔑党对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的政策。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人，却把这个反动的行动当作“红色资本家”的“事迹”来宣扬，说什么他“在公私合营时还亲自公开演戏欢庆”啦，并把他当作“和平改造”的活样板。不久，中国赫鲁晓夫又把他拉到北京，并亲自“接见”了他。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫的庇护下，这个反动资本家披上了一层红色外衣，在公私合营以后，反党反社会主义的活动更加嚣张了，声称要保住他那个公司的旧招牌，保住一套旧的人马，并狂妄地叫嚷说：“公司这块牌子不能丢，只要我的权保牢，原班人马保好，将来公司又是我的了。”真是一语暴露了所谓“红色资本家”的豺狼本性。
    铁的事实证明，中国赫鲁晓夫培养“红色资本家”是有其险恶用心的。曾记否，全国解放前夕，他在天津东亚毛纺织厂不是也积极地培养了一个“红色资本家”宋棐卿吗？中国赫鲁晓夫一贯地对培养“红色资本家”如此热心，如此卖力，说穿了，就是为了妄图在我国实现资本主义复辟，这些“红色资本家”就是他的最好的社会基础。
