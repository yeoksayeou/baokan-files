Chairman Mao's words are all truth; following Chairman Mao's words is victory. The vast majority of counties and cities in Jiangxi Province have achieved revolutionary great unity.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism," the proletarian revolutionary factions across the province have thoroughly criticized all non-proletarian thoughts, firmly established Mao Zedong Thought, further consolidated revolutionary great unity, and carried out revolutionary great criticism and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Nanchang on the 12th reported that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a wave of revolutionary great unity has swept across Jiangxi. In recent days, from the provincial capital Nanchang to medium and small towns, from plains to mountainous areas, news of great unity has been coming in one after another. Apart from the revolutionary great unity achieved in various sectors of the provincial capital Nanchang, six prefectures and more than 90% of the counties (cities) and towns in the province have also achieved revolutionary great unity. Currently, the proletarian revolutionary factions across the province are actively responding to Chairman Mao's call to "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism," thoroughly criticizing all non-proletarian thoughts, firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought, further consolidating revolutionary great unity from the ideological level, carrying out revolutionary great criticism and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and striving for a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

With the emergence of the revolutionary great unity wave, a wave of revolutionary great criticism and a new production wave are also rising across the province.

"Whatever Chairman Mao instructs, we will do!" This is the glorious tradition that the people of the Jiangxi revolutionary base area have long upheld. Recently, they have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary great unity should be achieved under revolutionary principles." They excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truth; following Chairman Mao's words is victory. We will carry them out to the letter!" Many units, with a "seize the day" revolutionary spirit, swiftly launched a wave of revolutionary great unity from the bottom up, from individual units to systems, and from systems to regions. In many units, there were two or more revolutionary mass organizations in opposition to each other just yesterday, but after negotiations, they united into a single revolutionary organization the next day; some counties (cities) and towns previously had many "factions," but now, in the tide of revolutionary great unity, they have all merged into a single revolutionary organization. In the Jian-Gangshan area, 13 counties and cities, including Suichuan, Wan'an, Taihe, and Jishui, achieved revolutionary great unity within a few days of receiving Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with more than a thousand units of revolutionary mass organizations uniting. In Ganzhou Prefecture, Ganzhou City's various revolutionary mass organizations had already united, and on September 25th, after hearing the great news of Chairman Mao's inspection of Jiangxi, the revolutionary factions were overjoyed and achieved system and regional revolutionary great unity within a day.

In the process of achieving revolutionary great unity, the most loyal people of the Jiangxi revolutionary base area, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, thus making revolutionary great unity both fast and good. Many revolutionary mass organizations, when resolving some differences among themselves, studied and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," recognizing that the differences among revolutionary mass organizations are based on fundamental interests and are contradictions among the people, the direction of struggle is completely consistent, and they should start from the overall situation, seek common ground while reserving differences, and unite to make the revolution. Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, and both sides actively conducted serious self-criticism, quickly eliminating misunderstandings and achieving revolutionary great unity. When forming the leadership core, they first studied "Old Three Articles," "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," and other brilliant works, criticized petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, and thus achieved large organizations not advocating "me first" and small organizations not contending for "seats."

After the revolutionary mass organizations across the province united, they concentrated their firepower and targets, aiming at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and launched a new wave of revolutionary great criticism in rural and urban areas. Since late September, revolutionary great criticism columns have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, and revolutionary big-character posters are everywhere; denunciation meetings, criticism meetings, and struggle meetings against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party have been held one after another, and everywhere is filled with a strong fighting atmosphere. After achieving revolutionary great unity, Shangrao City immediately formed the "Great Unity Revolutionary Great Criticism Group" to strengthen the leadership of revolutionary great criticism. In less than a week, the city set up more than a hundred large-scale revolutionary great criticism columns. After the revolutionary masses in Fuzhou united, more than 160 revolutionary great criticism columns were set up throughout the town. These columns each issue a special edition, focusing on criticizing the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party attempting to restore capitalism, with concentrated targets, fierce firepower, and lively forms.

In the counties and cities at the forefront of supporting agriculture, after achieving revolutionary great unity, the proletarian revolutionary factions can act and coordinate uniformly in their work, providing strong support for the current "three autumns" production and helping the poor and lower-middle peasants strive to achieve "six goods" in agriculture. Based on revolutionary great unity, the proletarian revolutionary factions in the counties and cities of the Jian-Gangshan area sent a large number of revolutionary cadres, workers, and revolutionary students to the countryside to support the "three autumns." In recent days, more than a dozen counties (cities) in the Yichun Prefecture, such as Anyi, Fengcheng, Tonggu, and Yichun, have held three-level cadre meetings and meetings of various industries after uniting by system and region, organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside, and allocated a large number of fertilizers and various small agricultural tools needed for the current autumn sowing of green manure and red flowers to the countryside. Currently, a production wave centered on the "three autumns" has risen across the region.

　　毛主席的话句句是真理　听毛主席的话就是胜利
　　江西省绝大部分县市实现革命大联合
    各地无产阶级革命派以毛主席的最新指示“斗私，批修”为纲，大破各种非无产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，进一步从思想上巩固革命大联合，搞好革命大批判和革命“三结合”
    新华社南昌十二日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示指引下，江西各地掀起了革命大联合的高潮。这些日子来，从省会南昌到中小城镇，从平原到山区，大联合的喜讯，一个接着一个。现在，除省会南昌市各条战线实现了革命大联合以外，全省六个专区和百分之九十以上的县（市）城镇也已实现了革命的大联合。目前，各地无产阶级革命派正积极响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的战斗号令，大破各种非无产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，进一步从思想上巩固革命的大联合，搞好革命的大批判和革命的“三结合”，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    随着革命大联合高潮的出现，一个革命大批判的高潮和新的生产高潮也正在全省各地兴起。
      “毛主席怎么指示，我们就怎么办！”这是江西革命老根据地人民长期继承下来的光荣传统。最近他们认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合，只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”他们激动地说：“毛主席的话句句是真理，听毛主席的话就是胜利，我们句句照办！”许多单位以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，极为迅速地掀起了从下到上、从单位到系统、从系统到地区的革命大联合高潮。不少单位昨天还有两个或几个革命群众组织互相对立，经过协商，第二天就联合成了一个统一的革命组织；部分县（市）城镇过去“山头”很多，如今在革命大联合的洪流中，也百川归大海，汇成一个统一的革命组织。井冈山地区的遂川、万安、泰和、吉水等十三个县市城镇，在毛主席最新指示传来的几天之内，便有一千多个单位的革命群众组织联合起来，实现了按单位、按系统、按地区的革命大联合。赣州专区赣州市各个单位的革命群众组织，早就联合起来了，九月二十五日听到我们伟大领袖毛主席视察江西的特大喜讯后，革命派欢欣鼓舞，一天内又实现了系统和地区的革命大联合。
    在实现革命大联合的过程中，最忠于毛主席的江西革命老根据地人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，因而使革命的大联合搞得既快又好。许多革命群众组织在解决彼此之间的一些分歧时，活学活用毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作，认识到革命群众组织之间的一些分歧，是根本利益一致基础上的人民内部矛盾，斗争的大方向是完全一致的，应该从大局出发，求大同、存小异，联合起来干革命。有些革命群众组织的负责人认真学习了毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导，双方都主动作了认真的自我批评，很快便消除了隔阂，实现了革命的大联合。在组成领导核心时，他们首先学习了“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，批判了小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性，因而做到了大组织不提“以我为主”，小组织不争“席位”。
    各地革命群众组织联合起来以后，集中火力，集中目标，对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，广大农村城镇迅速出现了革命大批判的新高潮。从九月下旬以来，全省各地无论是街道上，还是机关、工厂、学校内部，革命的大批判专栏犹如雨后春笋，革命的大字报琳琅满目；斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控诉会、批判会、斗争会一个接一个，到处充满了强烈的战斗气氛。上饶市实现革命大联合以后，立即组成了“大联筹革命大批判小组”，加强了对革命大批判的领导，不到一个星期，全市就办起了一百多个大型革命大批判专栏。抚州的革命群众联合起来以后，在全镇办起了一百六十多个革命大批判专栏。这些专栏每期都出专号，集中批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派企图复辟资本主义的罪行，目标集中，火力猛烈，形式也很生动活泼。
    处在支援农业第一线的专、县城镇的各行各业，实现革命大联合后，无产阶级革命派在工作上能够统一行动、统一调度，有力地支援了当前的“三秋”生产，支援了贫下中农努力做到农业“六好”。井冈山地区各县城镇在实现革命大联合的基础上，无产阶级革命派抽出了大批革命干部、工人和革命师生深入农村支援“三秋”。宜春专区的安义、丰城、铜鼓、宜春等十几个县（市），在按系统按地区联合起来以后，最近都纷纷召开了支援农业“三秋”工作的三级干部会，和各行业会议，组织了大批干部下乡，并调拨了大批当前农村秋播绿肥红花草所需要的化肥和大量铁制木制和篾制小农具下乡。目前，一个以“三秋”为中心的生产高潮已在全区兴起。
