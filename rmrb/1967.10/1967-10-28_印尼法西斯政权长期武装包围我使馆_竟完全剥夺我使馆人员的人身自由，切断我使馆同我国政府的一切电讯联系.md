The Indonesian fascist military regime, after mobilizing mobs and reactionary armed police and military to violently attack the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on October 1, has been continuously besieging the Chinese Embassy with armed forces, completely stripping the Chinese Embassy staff of their personal freedom.

For more than twenty days, the Indonesian fascist military regime has dispatched heavy troops to tightly seal off the Chinese Embassy, cutting off all communications between the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese government, and stopping the supply of water, electricity, and gas. Since September 28, the entrance to the Chinese Embassy has been blocked by reactionary police and military using trucks, effectively imprisoning the Chinese Embassy staff inside. When Chinese Embassy staff go out to greet visiting diplomats from other countries, they are often pushed away by reactionary soldiers with rifle butts. Since October 16, the siege has become even stricter, and foreign diplomats visiting the embassy often face harassment.

The Indonesian fascist military regime even stipulates that without the permission of the Jakarta military authorities and the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, no one is allowed to visit the seriously injured acting charge d'affaires Huang Wensheng and other four injured personnel in the hospital, nor are Chinese Embassy staff allowed to escort other injured personnel to the hospital for treatment. Since October 1, through the repeated and heroic struggles of the Chinese Embassy staff, the reactionary authorities in Indonesia have only allowed Chinese Embassy staff to visit the hospital four times, and have dispatched armed personnel to monitor. The seriously injured acting charge d'affaires Huang Wensheng and other personnel in the hospital have been under strict surveillance by reactionary soldiers, completely deprived of their freedom.

    印尼法西斯政权长期武装包围我使馆
    竟完全剥夺我使馆人员的人身自由，切断我使馆同我国政府的一切电讯联系
    新华社二十七日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权自十月一日调动暴徒和反动武装军警疯狂袭击中国驻印尼大使馆以后，一直对中国大使馆进行武装包围，完全剥夺了中国大使馆人员的人身自由。
    二十多天来，印尼法西斯军人政权派遣重兵，对中国大使馆实行严密的武装封锁，切断了中国大使馆同中国政府的一切电讯联系，断绝了水、电和煤气供应。中国大使馆的门口，自九月二十八日起就被反动军警用卡车挡住，中国大使馆人员实际上被监禁在馆内。中国大使馆人员出门迎接来访的一些国家使节时，经常被反动军人用枪托无理推挡。自十六日以来，封锁更严，外国使节来访经常受到刁难。
    印尼法西斯军人政权甚至规定未经雅加达军事当局和印尼外交部的许可，任何人不得到医院看望中国大使馆临时代办黄文胜等四名重伤人员，也不准中国大使馆人员护送其他重伤员去医院治疗。自十月一日以来，经过中国大使馆人员的反复、英勇斗争，印尼反动当局只准许中国使馆人员去医院探望四次，并派武装人员监视。中国大使馆临时代办黄文胜等重伤人员在医院内也一直遭到反动军人的严密监视，完全被剥夺了自由。
