Title: So "Unyielding"

The film "The Fate of a Man," adapted from the novel of the same name by the Soviet revisionist literary forefather Sholokhov, is a poisonous weed that curses revolutionary war and advocates the philosophy of survival. It strives to whitewash the film's protagonist Sokolov—a traitor.

A fake pearl cannot be passed off as a real one. A disguised traitor is still a traitor.

The film's ending shows the following subtitle: "I hope that this Russian, this person with an unyielding will, can endure everything..."

What "unyielding will"? This is all deceitful nonsense!

To submit to the enemy, taking off one's own boots and socks obediently and handing them over to the enemy with both hands, is this "unyielding will"?

In the enemy's prisoner-of-war camp, trembling with fear, enduring humiliation, and fearing a beating, working hard for the enemy by moving stones, is this "unyielding will"?

Gulping down three large cups of "vodka" given by the enemy like a wolf, being so grateful for the butter and bread rewarded by the camp commander, and gnawing at the chicken bones thrown by the German officer like a dog, is this "unyielding will"?

Enough, this is absolutely not "unyielding will," this is sheer surrender, this is barefaced betrayal!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If a person, a party, an army, or a school is not opposed by the enemy, then it is not good, it must be colluding with the enemy."

The one depicted as a "Red Army hero," Sokolov, was spared by the enemy twice, and was even appreciated and utilized by the enemy, which is enough to expose his traitorous face.

The creators of the film racked their brains, piecing together layer upon layer of enchanting veils for Sokolov. However, the more they cover up, the more it is exposed. Sokolov's rotten, stinking traitorous soul is unhideable! Strip off his disguise, and you can see that he is a thorough traitor! It is no wonder that Sholokhov and his kind have unlimited sympathy for such a traitor. Because Sholokhov and his master Khrushchev are themselves thorough traitors. They flirt with imperialism, kiss and hug, conspire, and collude. Khrushchev, Sholokhov, and Sokolov are birds of a feather.

Birds of a feather flock together. The traitor philosophy advocated by China's Khrushchev is so similar to the traitor philosophy advocated by Sholokhov and Khrushchev!

    如此“不屈不挠”
    上海无线电七厂　陈正余
    根据苏修文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫的同名小说改编的影片《一个人的遭遇》，是一株诅咒革命战争、鼓吹活命哲学的大毒草，它竭力为影片的主人公索科洛夫——一个叛徒涂脂抹粉。
    鱼目不能混珠。经过化装的叛徒终究还是叛徒。
    影片结尾出现这样的字幕：“我希望，这个俄罗斯人，这个具有不屈不挠意志的人能经受一切……”。
    什么“不屈不挠”？这是骗人的鬼话！
    对敌人俯首听命，把自己的靴子和袜子服服贴贴的脱下来，双手送给敌人，这是“不屈不挠”吗？
    在敌人的俘虏营里，胆颤心惊，忍辱负重，生怕挨打就卖力地为敌人搬石头，这是“不屈不挠”吗？
    狼吞虎咽般狂饮敌人施舍的三大杯“伏特加”，对俘虏营营长犒赏他牛油和面包是那样的感激涕零，象狼狗一样啃着德国少校扔给他的鸡骨头，这是“不屈不挠”吗？
    够了，这绝不是什么“不屈不挠”，这是十十足足的投降，这是赤裸裸的背叛！
    毛主席教导我们：“一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。”
    被描绘成“红军英雄”的索科洛夫，敌人两次枪下留情，而且得到敌人的赏识和重用，就足以暴露他的叛徒嘴脸了。
    影片的炮制者，挖空心思，七拼八凑地为索科洛夫蒙上了一层层迷人的面纱。但是，欲盖弥彰。索科洛夫的腐朽发臭的叛徒灵魂，是遮盖不住的！剥去他的伪装，就可以看出他是一个彻头彻尾的叛徒！肖洛霍夫之流对于这样一个叛徒寄予无限的同情，那是不足为奇的。因为，肖洛霍夫和他的主子赫鲁晓夫之流本身就是道道地地的叛徒。他们和帝国主义眉来眼去，亲吻拥抱，勾勾搭搭，狼狈为奸。赫鲁晓夫，肖洛霍夫和索科洛夫是一丘之貉。
    物以类聚，人以群分。中国的赫鲁晓夫宣扬的一套叛徒哲学，和肖洛霍夫、赫鲁晓夫之流所鼓吹的一套何等相似乃尔！
