Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are used by them.

Reading Chairman Mao's works at the very desk where he wrote them years ago is particularly warm and happy. Dear Chairman Mao! How much the Japanese revolutionary people yearn for you and how much they love your brilliant works! Because your works are the beacon guiding our revolution.

When the Japanese Hagariza Theater Troupe visited the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, they stood in front of the cave where Chairman Mao once lived, taking a commemorative photo with the old Red Army soldiers and the old village chief, filled with boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

When the Japanese Hagariza Theater Troupe visited the famous Erqi Locomotive Factory, the deputy director, Hattori Seishiku, participated in labor in the forging workshop, demonstrating the deep friendship between the revolutionary people of China and Japan.

The Japanese Hagariza Theater Troupe visited the famous agricultural advanced unit in China - Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province. The left photo shows Chairman Mao's good student, the Party Secretary of Dazhai Brigade, Chen Yonggui, having a friendly conversation with the troupe leader, Fujikawa Natsuko; the lower left photo shows the revolutionary cultural workers of the Japanese Hagariza Theater Troupe performing revolutionary songs and dances in the fields for the revolutionary masses of Dazhai.

During their performance in Beijing, the revolutionary cultural workers of the Japanese Hagariza Theater Troupe visited the revolutionary young guards of the Red Flag of Northern Aviation. They had a friendly discussion about the situation of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

The hearts of the revolutionary people of China and Japan are connected. After watching the Chinese revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women," the friends from the Japanese Hagariza Theater Troupe went on stage, holding hands with the Chinese revolutionary cultural workers, waving the red book, and repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Japan!"

The revolutionary cultural workers of the Japanese Hagariza Theater Troupe, with a strong class hatred towards the landlord class, visited the large clay sculpture exhibition "The Rent Collection Courtyard." They not only appreciated the Chinese revolutionary cultural works but also received profound class education. They expressed their determination to become Chairman Mao's revolutionary cultural warriors and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life.

    做毛主席的革命文艺战士
    ——日本齿轮座剧团在中国
    我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。
    在毛主席当年写作的办公桌前读毛主席的宝书，格外的温暖、幸福。敬爱的毛主席啊！我们日本革命人民是多么的向往您，多么的热爱您的光辉著作呀，因为您的著作是指引我们闹革命的光芒万丈的灯塔。

    中日两国革命人民的心是连在一起的。日本齿轮座的朋友们观看了中国革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》之后，走上台去，和中国革命文艺工作者手挽着手，挥动着红色宝书不断高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中日两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    日本齿轮座的革命文艺工作者怀着对地主阶级的强烈的阶级仇恨参观了大型泥塑群像展览《收租院》。他们不但欣赏了中国的革命文艺作品，而且受到了深刻的阶级教育。他们表示一定要做毛主席的革命文艺战士，为工农兵服务一辈子。新华社记者　李生南摄
