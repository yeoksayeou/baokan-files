Tanzanian youth demand the expulsion of the U.S. "Peace Corps"

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the *Uhuru* newspaper of Tanzania reported on the 2nd that the Youth League of the Tanganyika African National Union passed a resolution at its conference, demanding the immediate expulsion of all U.S. "Peace Corps" members from the mainland of Tanzania.

The conference, held from September 27th to 30th in Dar es Salaam, also called for the expulsion of foreign teachers from capitalist countries. This is because they disrupt the thoughts of Tanzanian youth, leading them astray from the policy of self-reliance in building the nation.

    坦桑青年要求驱逐美国“和平队”
    据新华社讯　据坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》二日报道，坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟青年团大会通过决议，要求立即从坦桑尼亚大陆驱逐所有美国“和平队”队员。
    从九月二十七日到三十日在达累斯萨拉姆举行的这次大会，还要求驱逐来自资本主义国家的外籍教师，因为他们搅乱坦桑尼亚青年的思想，把青年引向背离自力更生建设国家的方针。
