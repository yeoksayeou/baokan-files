Over the past two years, Albanian peasants, advancing steadily along the revolutionary path, have utilized the winter slack season and intervals between farm work to launch a production drive. They have constructed numerous terraces for water conservation, soil preservation, drought prevention, and flood control. Some agricultural production cooperatives have even been hailed as "Albania's Dazhai." According to statistics, this year the country has reclaimed and built 8,500 hectares of terraces and reclaimed 21,700 hectares of wasteland. In addition, various regions have responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania to launch a land leveling movement, with plans to complete land leveling in all plain areas by next year. Currently, 80 to 90 percent of the land in areas like Lushnje and Lezhë has been leveled.

To increase agricultural production and achieve self-sufficiency in grain, various regions have been continuously engaged in water conservancy projects and expanding irrigation areas. Currently, the country's irrigation area has reached 220,000 hectares, accounting for 48 percent of the total cultivated land. This year, the state plans to invest 41 percent of the total agricultural investment in water conservancy projects, an increase of 30.5 million lek from last year. The plan also stipulates the construction of 81 large-scale water conservancy projects in mountainous and hilly regions. Most of these projects are now completed or nearing completion. These water conservancy projects can expand the irrigation area by 4,350 hectares.

To increase grain production, various regions have actively promoted advanced agricultural production experiences. They have also adopted advanced sowing methods such as intercropping, relay cropping, hole planting, and row planting, according to local conditions, developing a diversified economy that combines agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline production. This year, in the districts of Korçë and Lushnje, the area sown with corn using hole planting or row planting methods accounts for more than 65 percent.

Due to the comprehensive implementation of the "Agricultural Code" formulated by the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects, the promotion of advanced agricultural production experiences, and especially the focus on key links such as soil, water, and fertilizer, many agricultural production cooperatives across the country have overcome the situation of grain shortages. In the district of Gjirokastër, only half of the agricultural production cooperatives could achieve grain self-sufficiency in the past few years. Last year, all cooperative members in the district demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary spirit, constructing terraces, leveling land, building water conservancy projects, using organic fertilizer, and strengthening field management. As a result, out of the 28 agricultural production cooperatives in the district, 22 achieved grain self-sufficiency and even sold surplus grain to the state. The "Zoja Çurë" agricultural production cooperative in the district of Mat, which relied on state grain supplies before 1964, has, after several years of hard work, not only achieved grain self-sufficiency but can also sell surplus grain to the state, transforming from one of the most backward agricultural cooperatives in the district to one of the most advanced.

### 积极响应劳动党第五次代表大会号召掀起生产热潮  阿尔巴尼亚农业产量大幅度增长

    积极响应劳动党第五次代表大会号召掀起生产热潮
    阿尔巴尼亚农业产量大幅度增长
    最近两年来，在革命化道路上不断前进的阿尔巴尼亚农民，利用冬闲和农活间隙，掀起生产热潮，修建了许多保水、保土、防旱、防涝的梯田。有的农业生产合作社还被人们誉为“阿尔巴尼亚的大寨”。据统计，今年全国已开垦和修筑梯田八千五百多公顷、开垦荒地二万一千七百多公顷。此外，各地还响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的号召，掀起平整土地的运动，全国平原地区的土地计划在明年平整完毕。目前卢什涅、莱希等区百分之八十到九十的土地已平整完毕。
    为了提高农业生产、实现粮食自给的目标，各地不断兴修水利，扩大灌溉面积。目前，全国灌溉面积已达二十二万公顷，占全国耕地面积的百分之四十八。今年国家计划建设水利工程投资占整个农业计划投资的百分之四十一，比去年增加三千零五十万里克，计划还规定在山区和丘陵地区修建八十一项大型水利工程。目前已大部分建成，或即将完工。这些水利工程可扩大灌溉面积四千三百五十公顷。
    为了增加粮食生产，各地还积极推广农业生产先进经验。各地还因地制宜地推广间种、套种、穴种或条种等先进播种方法，发展农、畜、牧、副相结合的多种经营。科尔察和卢什涅区今年播种玉米时，穴种或条种的面积达百分之六十五以上。
    由于全面地贯彻劳动党中央所制定的“农艺法典”，兴修农田水利，推广农业生产先进经验，特别是狠抓土、水、肥等重要环节，全国许多农业生产合作社已经摆脱了粮食不能自给的状况。吉诺卡斯特区过去几年只有一半农业生产合作社能够做到粮食自给，去年全区农业生产合作社员发扬高度的革命精神，修筑梯田，平整土地，兴修水利，使用有机肥，加强田间管理，结果全区二十八个农业生产合作社中有二十二个社达到了粮食自给，并向国家交售了余粮。马蒂区“宗雅·丘雷”农业生产合作社在一九六四年以前一直依靠国家供应粮食。经过几年的艰苦奋战，目前全社不仅可以做到粮食自给，而且还可向国家交售余粮，从全区最落后的一个农业社一跃而为全区最先进的农业社之一。　（据新华社讯）
