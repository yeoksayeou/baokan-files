	“Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line” Art Exhibition in Beijing

	The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary artists, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have created a large number of artworks. They enthusiastically sing the praises of the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and mercilessly criticize the capitalist roaders in power within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 16th, to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the “Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line” revolutionary art exhibition is being held at the China Art Museum. This unprecedented large-scale revolutionary art exhibition displays a large number of artworks that reflect the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from various angles.

	In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary artists, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. They wielded their pens as swords and guns, creating a large number of artworks in the great criticism movement. They enthusiastically sang the praises of the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and mercilessly criticized the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. The works on display include large photographs and various paintings, vivid and lifelike clay sculptures, and craft artworks with entirely new content. Over 60% of the works were created by workers, peasants, and soldiers. The entire art museum displays the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and radiates the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary artists, with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, depicted his brilliant image using various art forms. Here, there is a woodcut of Chairman Mao's full-color portrait created by workers from the Capital Steel Company, a painting titled “The Tiger Crouches, the Dragon Coils, Today's Scene is Better Than Yesterday's, the Earth Turns Over, the Heavens Shake” created by a member of a commune in the Beijing suburbs, showing Chairman Mao waving to billions of revolutionary masses, and a print created by revolutionary artists depicting Chairman Mao's brilliant image in various revolutionary periods. Many viewers, in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant image, wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

	The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love studying Chairman Mao's works the most and are the most enthusiastic in propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The “Chairman Mao Quotations Art Exhibition” on display here is a new artistic form created by Shanghai workers, peasants, Red Guards, and artists with strong class feelings towards Chairman Mao's works to propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken to the art stage in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line. They have shown boundless wisdom and artistic creativity. The clay sculptures on display here, created by six air force soldiers who had never studied art creation over more than three months, vividly recreate the class struggle history of blood and tears in the old society. This set of clay sculptures is lifelike and powerfully refutes China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacy of “exploitation is meritorious.” The large clay sculpture “In Praise of the Red Guards” enthusiastically sings the praises of the great achievements made by the broad masses of Red Guards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao.

	Many of the works on display are unprecedented records of the glorious process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The glorious achievements of the Red Guards, moving scenes of supporting the army and loving the people, the great storm of the “January Revolution” in Shanghai, the spring thunder in the Southwest, the new dawn in the Northeast, and other great scenes, as well as the great deeds of hundreds of millions of people across the country following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, launching a great criticism movement, and achieving a great alliance of revolution, and the moving scenes of people around the world eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works, are all vividly reflected.

　　“毛主席革命路线胜利万岁”美术作品在京展出
　　广大工农兵、红卫兵和革命美术工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，创作大量美术作品，热烈歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，无情地批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    据新华社十六日讯　为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年举办的“毛主席革命路线胜利万岁”革命美术展览，在中国美术馆展出。这次规模空前的革命美展展出了大量美术作品，从各个角度反映了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大工农兵、红卫兵小将和革命美术工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开猛烈攻击。他们用笔作刀枪，在革命大批判中创作出大量美术作品，热烈歌颂伟大领袖毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，无情地批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。这次展出的作品有巨幅的照片和各种画，有形象生动的泥塑，有内容全新的工艺美术品，其中百分之六十以上是工农兵创作的。整个美术馆显示着毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，放射出毛泽东思想的万丈光芒。
    毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。广大工农兵、红卫兵小将和革命美术工作者，在无产阶级文化大革命中，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，用各种艺术形式描绘我们伟大领袖的光辉形象。这里有首都钢铁公司工人创作的木刻毛主席全身彩色画像，有北京郊区人民公社社员创作的题为《虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷》的毛主席向亿万革命群众挥手致意的画像，有革命美术工作者创作的版画毛主席在各个革命时期的光辉形象。许多观众在伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象前面，祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    广大工农兵群众最爱学习毛主席著作，最积极地宣传毛泽东思想。这里展出的“毛主席语录画展”，就是上海工农兵、红卫兵小将和美术工作者，怀着对毛主席著作的强烈阶级感情，创造的宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新的艺术形式。
    广大工农兵是在同反革命修正主义文艺黑线斗争中登上美术舞台的。他们表现出了无比的智慧和艺术创作才能。这里展出的由六位从未学过美术创作的空军战士经过三个多月时间塑造出来的一组泥塑，活生生地再现了旧社会的阶级斗争血泪史。这组泥塑形象逼真，有力地痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的反革命谬论。大型泥塑《红卫兵赞》从各方面热情地歌颂了广大红卫兵小将在无产阶级文化大革命中，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，建立的丰功伟绩。
    这次展出的许多作品，也是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命光辉进程的纪录。红卫兵的光辉战绩，拥军爱民的动人场景，上海“一月革命”风暴、西南的春雷、东北的新曙光等伟大的场面，以及全国亿万人民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，展开革命大批判、实现革命大联合的壮举，世界人民如饥似渴学习毛主席著作的动人画面，都有真实生动的反映。
