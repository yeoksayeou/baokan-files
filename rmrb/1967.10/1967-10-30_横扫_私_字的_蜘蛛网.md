Young cadre of Hongjing Brigade, Cao Peiying, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, says:

Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Comrade White (White) who has "no selfishness and no personal gain." However, the Chinese Khrushchev tries to seduce us into seeking personal gain, promotion, and wealth, and to climb up. The poison of Chinese Khrushchev's revisionism is like a spider web, everywhere in the corners and crevices. We must use the iron broom of Mao Zedong Thought to sweep it clean.

The Chinese Khrushchev once told the sent-down educated youth: "After you return to the countryside, it is best not to be an official, not even an accountant. Just work honestly in the fields for three to five years, and if you meet three conditions (knowing how to do everything in farming, having culture, and having good relations with the masses), you can become an official at the township, county, or provincial level, or even go to the central government. It all depends on your abilities." In the end, it is to make us strive for "selfishness," for our own future fame and fortune, promotion, and wealth.

I was also poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev. Because of work needs, when the leadership assigned me to be an accountant, I was very unhappy. I heard people say, "Accounting work is very difficult, if you make a mistake, you will have to bear the loss and be scolded." I thought, our brigade has many people and households, if I make a mistake, it will really be "carrying a stone mill to perform, laboring without reward." So, I was always not content with my work.

With such selfish thoughts, how could I draw a clear line with the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev? Things like "fame and fortune," "suffer a little loss to gain a big advantage," "suffer first and enjoy later," etc., once heard, they would enter my ears. My mind was filled with "selfishness" all day, if it developed further, I would become a successor of revisionism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we cannot give up?" To break selfishness and establish public spirit, and to carry out a thorough revolution in the depths of the soul, we must go through a fierce struggle in our minds. Chairman Mao's words point out the direction for us to advance. The shining images of Zhang Zedong, White, and the Old Man Moving Mountains set examples for us to learn from. I fought hard against the "selfishness" in my mind and bravely took up the work.

However, the enemy in our minds is very stubborn. Sometimes when encountering difficulties, or when doing less housework, "selfishness" would rise up. I use the "Three Articles" to constantly fight against "selfishness." I deeply feel that without reading Chairman Mao's books, "selfishness" would come out to cause trouble. With "selfishness" in the mind, one cannot sit still, stand firm, have a clear direction, or have a clear mind. There is no confidence in work, no strength in labor, and work is not done for the revolution. After reading Chairman Mao's books, breaking selfishness, having a clear mind, and a firm stand, one will not be shaken by great winds and waves, and will wholeheartedly work for the revolution.

Water has a source, and trees have roots. The root of revisionism is "selfishness," and the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev is "revisionism" and "selfishness." Only by fighting against selfishness can we more thoroughly criticize revisionism. The weapon for fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we must often read (Chairman Mao's books), carefully connect (our thoughts), fiercely fight (our selfishness), constantly dig (the root of selfishness), and thoroughly eliminate (bourgeois individualism). Only in this way can we ensure that we do not change quality and become good successors of communism.

    横扫“私”字的“蜘蛛网”
    洪泾大队青年社员学习毛主席著作积极分子  曹培英
    毛主席教导我们要学习白求恩同志“毫无自私自利之心的精神”。而中国赫鲁晓夫却竭力引诱我们为个人升官发财，向上爬。中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义流毒，真象蜘蛛网一样，壁角落里都有。我们一定要用毛泽东思想的铁扫帚，把它扫个精光。
    中国赫鲁晓夫曾经对下乡知识青年说：“你们回农村后，最好不当干部，连会计也不要当。老老实实种三五年地，具备了三条（种地样样都会，有文化，群众关系好）就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央，那就看各人的本事了。”说来说去，就是叫我们一心为“私”，为自己将来成名成家，升官发财而奋斗。
    我也受到中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害。因为工作需要，当领导上分配我当会计时，心里就很不开心。听人说“会计工作很难弄，弄错了要吃赔账，还要挨骂。”心想，我们队里人多、户多，弄不好，真是“顶着石臼做戏，吃力不讨好”。所以总是不安心工作。
    有了这样一些私心，哪里还能同中国赫鲁晓夫散布的流毒划清界线。什么“成名成家”，“吃小亏，占大便宜”，“吃苦在前，享福在后”等等，耳朵里一听就进。头脑里一天到晚为“私”字打算，如果发展下去，就会成为修正主义接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”破私立公，灵魂深处闹革命，是要经过一场激烈的思想斗争的。毛主席的话，给我们指明了前进的方向，张思德、白求恩、老愚公的光辉形象，给我们树立了学习的榜样。我狠斗了头脑里的“私”字，勇敢地挑起了工作的担子。
    但是，思想上的敌人是很顽固的，有时碰到困难，或者少做了一些家务，“私”字就要抬头，我就用“老三篇”，不断和“私”字作斗争。我深深体会到，不读毛主席的书，“私”字就要出来作怪。头脑里有了“私”字，坐不定，立不稳，方向不明，头脑不清，工作没有信心，劳动没有劲，做工作不是为革命；读了毛主席的书，破了私心，头脑清醒，立场坚定，大风大浪不动摇，全心全意为革命。
    水有源，树有根，修正主义的总根子就是“私”，中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒就是“修”和“私”。只有斗私，才能更彻底地批修。斗私批修的武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。所以我们一定要经常读（读毛主席的书），好好联（联系自己的思想），狠狠斗（斗自己的私心），不断挖（挖私心的根子），彻底灭（克服资产阶级个人主义）。这样才能保证自己不变质，当好共产主义接班人。
