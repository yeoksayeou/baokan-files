Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades, and Dear Friends:

It is an honor for us to have you here tonight at the reception hosted by the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Revolutionary Movement and Government Delegation, which I am leading.

Your presence embodies the active friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville).

Please allow me to express, on behalf of the National Revolutionary Movement, its General Secretary and President of the Republic, Alphonse Massamba-Débat, the Congolese government and people, and in my personal capacity, our most sincere gratitude.

Your Excellency, the warm welcome extended to us by the people of your country has deeply moved us. We had the opportunity to meet and talk with the Red Guards, students, soldiers, workers, and peasants. Through these interactions, we saw that everyone is striving to learn and apply the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong. We also witnessed how the Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's invincible thoughts, are truly transforming their country: The Shashanyu Production Brigade has turned barren land into fertile fields; the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army cultivate their own land, raise livestock, and meet their own needs through their production units, thus reducing the burden on the people; the Red Guards are determined to build China into a highly developed socialist country where people are always the decisive factor and the people are the true heroes.

We believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, will further accelerate the revolutionization of the masses, enabling them to fulfill their internationalist duties.

The Cultural Revolution has already had an impact abroad. Chairman Mao said correctly at the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949: "Our revolution has won the sympathy and acclaim of the broad masses of the people throughout the world, and our friends are found in every corner of the globe."

No matter how much slander and defamation is directed at the People's Republic of China, we believe that the world must learn to face reality, that is, the People's Republic of China must restore its rightful seat in the United Nations, and the reactionary clique ruling Taiwan must be expelled from the United Nations.

The Congo (Brazzaville) highly values the friendship between the Congo (Brazzaville) and the People's Republic of China, and, as President Alphonse Massamba-Débat has consistently declared, reaffirms: Since the establishment of relations between our two countries, the People's Republic of China has never attempted to interfere in our internal affairs in any way. On the contrary, the People's Republic of China has always sought friendly and frank cooperation with the Congolese people.

China's aid has not only enabled us to defeat the plots to strangle our economy but has also, especially, enabled us to lay the foundations for building a truly independent economy in our country.

There is a saying that the manner of giving is more important than the gift itself. When the People's Republic of China aids our country, it does not haggle like the imperialists and old and new colonialists, but fully demonstrates understanding and brotherly spirit, respecting our country's dignity and sovereignty.

The Congo (Brazzaville) is a newly independent African country surrounded by countries that have made different political choices. The Congo (Brazzaville) has consistently pursued a policy of non-alignment, but this non-alignment does not mean neutrality. This policy of non-alignment enables the Congo (Brazzaville) to judge the policies of every country and every international organization in the world without any external pressure and to make its own decisions based on the fundamental interests of its own people and the fundamental interests of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and all oppressed classes in the world.

The President of the Republic of the Congo often says: Our non-alignment is to consciously promote the development of history together with the peoples of all countries who are struggling for national liberation and the defense of their sovereignty.

We are pleased to see that the People's Republic of China respects this policy that we have adopted in international affairs.

Finally, we must condemn the aggressive war being waged by American imperialism and its lackeys in Vietnam. We are confident that all the "hawks" will be annihilated in the jungle of revolutionary war.

The Vietnamese people will definitely defeat American imperialism and its lackeys.

Your Excellency,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Comrades and Dear Friends:

I propose a toast:

To the health and longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader beloved by the Chinese people,

To the health of our Party's General Secretary and President of the Republic, Alphonse Massamba-Débat,

To the health of Premier Zhou Enlai,

To the health of the envoys and their spouses present,

To the health of the comrades and friends present,

To the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,

To the unbreakable friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville),

To the victory of the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against the American aggressors and their lackeys,

To the unity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America,

To the victory of socialism,

Cheers!

    在刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团访问中国举行的告别宴会上
    努马扎莱总理的讲话
    新华社五日讯　刚果（布）共和国总理、政府首脑安布鲁瓦斯·努马扎莱在刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团访问中国举行的宴会上的讲话总理同志，诸位阁下，女士们、先生们，同志们，亲爱的朋友们：
    你们光临由我率领的刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团今晚举行的招待会，使我们感到荣幸。
    你们的光临体现了中华人民共和国和刚果（布）共和国之间的积极的友谊。
    请允许我代表全国革命运动，代表全国革命运动总书记和共和国总统阿方斯·马桑巴—代巴兄弟，代表刚果政府和刚果人民，并以我个人的名义，向你们表示十分诚挚的谢意。
    总理同志，贵国人民那么热烈地欢迎我们，使我们十分感动。
    我们有机会同红卫兵、学生、士兵、工人和农民群众进行了接触和谈话。通过这些接触和谈话，我们了解到每个人都在努力学习和运用毛泽东主席的战无不胜的思想。我们还看到，中国人民在毛泽东主席的战无不胜的思想的指导下，真正在改造自己的国家：沙石峪生产队就是这样把布满沙砾的不毛之地变成了肥沃的良田；人民解放军的战士就是这样自己耕地、放牧，靠自己的生产单位来满足自己的需要，从而减轻了人民的负担；红卫兵就是这样决心把中国建设成一个高度发展的社会主义国家，在这样的一个国家里，人始终是决定性的因素，人民永远是真正的英雄。
    我们相信，由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，必将进一步加速人民群众的革命化，使他们能够完成自己的国际主义的任务。
    文化革命已经在国外产生影响。毛主席在一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议上说得对：“我们的革命已经获得全世界广大人民的同情和欢呼，我们的朋友遍于全世界。”
    不论人们怎样对中华人民共和国进行造谣诬蔑，我们认为世界必须学会正视现实，这就是说，必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位，必须把统治台湾的反动派从联合国内驱逐出去。
    刚果（布）高度评价刚果（布）同中华人民共和国的友谊，并且象刚果（布）共和国总统阿方斯·马桑巴—代巴兄弟一贯声明的那样，重申：中华人民共和国从我们两国建立关系以来，从未试图以这种或者那种方式来干涉我国的内政。相反，中华人民共和国一贯友好地寻求同刚果人民进行坦率的合作。
    中国的援助使我们不仅能够胜利地击败了窒息我国经济的图谋，而且特别使我们能够开始为我国建立真正独立的经济奠定了基础。
    有一句成语说，赠送的方式比赠送的东西更为重要。中华人民共和国在援助我国的时候，并不象帝国主义和新老殖民主义那样讨价还价，而是充分表现出谅解和兄弟般的精神，尊重我国的尊严和主权。
    刚果（布）是一个新独立的非洲国家，它周围的国家在政治上作出了不同的抉择。刚果（布）一贯奉行不结盟政策，但是这种不结盟不等于中立，这种不结盟政策使刚果（布）能够在不受任何外来压力的情况下判断世界上每一个国家和每一个国际组织的政策，并且根据本国人民的根本利益，根据亚非拉各国人民和世界上一切被压迫阶级的根本利益作出自己的决定。
    刚果（布）共和国总统经常说：我们的不结盟就是同为争取民族解放和维护自己主权而斗争的各国人民一起，自觉地促进历史的发展。
    我们高兴地看到，中华人民共和国尊重我国在国际事务中采取的这一方针。
    最后，我们还要谴责美帝国主义及其走狗在越南进行的侵略战争。我们坚信，所有的“鹰”派必将在革命战争的丛林中被消灭。
    越南人民必将战胜美帝国主义及其走狗。
    总理同志，
    诸位阁下，
    女士们、先生们，
    同志们、亲爱的朋友们：
    我提议：
    为中国人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的健康长寿，
    为我们党的总书记、共和国总统阿方斯·马桑巴—代巴兄弟的健康，
    为周恩来总理的健康，
    为在座的各位使节和夫人们的健康，
    为在座的同志们和朋友们的健康，
    为无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，
    为中华人民共和国和刚果（布）共和国之间的牢不可破的友谊，
    为英勇的越南人民反对美国侵略者及其走狗的斗争的胜利，
    为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的团结，
    为社会主义的胜利，
    干杯！
