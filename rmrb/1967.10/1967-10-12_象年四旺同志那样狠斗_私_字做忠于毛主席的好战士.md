Great Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured countless good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Comrade Nian Siyang is a prominent example. To rescue a passenger train and safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he acted bravely and fearlessly, sustaining severe injuries. When his memory was severely impaired, he forgot everything—his parents, his hometown, his comrades, and even his own name. But he never forgot Chairman Mao. He missed Chairman Mao, sang praises to Chairman Mao, and could write the three characters of Chairman Mao's name and recite quotations from Chairman Mao. Comrade Nian Siyang, with his heroic deeds, has set a fine example for us of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Why could Comrade Nian Siyang become a good soldier loyal to Chairman Mao? It is because he bravely fought the "private" self with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly breaking away from private interests and establishing public interests.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us to fight the "private" self and criticize revisionism.

The "private" self is the core of the ideological consciousness of all exploiting classes, the soil in which revisionism grows and develops, and the root of all evil. Only by overcoming the "private" self can we thoroughly criticize revisionism and effectively prevent the restoration of capitalism. Only by overcoming the "private" self can we be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Every genuine proletarian revolutionary and every good soldier loyal to Chairman Mao should resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instruction to "fight the 'private' self and criticize revisionism." They should bravely shoulder the dual burdens of transforming both the objective world and the subjective world, serving as both pioneers in criticizing revisionism and models in fighting the "private" self.

To fight the "private" self, one must, like Comrade Nian Siyang, diligently and painstakingly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and earnestly study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles." One must always use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, and with the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as taught by Chairman Mao, examine oneself from the depths of one's soul. One must strive to free oneself from the influence of the "private" self of the exploiting classes over thousands of years and become a communist warrior with no trace of selfishness and personal gain.

To fight the "private" self, one must, like Comrade Nian Siyang, take the initiative to launch an offensive against the "private" self, seizing every fleeting thought. One must never adopt a lenient, compromising, or indulgent attitude. As soon as the "private" self rears its head, even if it is just a fleeting selfish thought, one must firmly grasp it and eliminate it.

"Public" and "private," proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, the two sides are in a fierce battle. It is either one side devouring the other. Only by allowing no room in one's mind for the "private" self, as Comrade Nian Siyang did, can one truly overcome the "private" self and establish public interests, transforming one's worldview.

Let us take Comrade Nian Siyang as our example, riding the winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Let us thoroughly overcome selfish thoughts, strengthen ideological transformation, and ensure that our socialist motherland remains free from revisionism for generations to come, forever preserving its revolutionary youth!

　　象年四旺同志那样狠斗“私”字做忠于毛主席的好战士
    伟大的毛泽东思想，哺育了千千万万个毛主席的好战士。年四旺同志就是一个突出的代表。他为了抢救旅客列车，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，英勇无畏，身负重伤。在他的记忆力受到严重破坏的时候，他什么都忘了，忘了爹娘，忘了家乡，忘了战友，也忘了自己的姓名，但是，他永远忘不了毛主席，他想念毛主席，歌唱毛主席，能写毛主席三个字，能背毛主席语录。年四旺同志以自己的英雄行为，为我们树立了一个忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的好榜样。
    年四旺同志为什么能够成为忠于毛主席的好战士？就是因为他勇于用毛泽东思想同“私”字作坚决的斗争，不断地破私立公。
    毛主席最近指示我们，要斗私，批修。
    “私”字，是一切剥削阶级思想意识的核心，是修正主义产生和发展的土壤，是万恶之源。斗倒“私”字，才能彻底地批判修正主义，有效地防止资本主义复辟。斗倒“私”字，才能无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    每一个真正的无产阶级革命派，每一个忠于毛主席的好战士，都应该坚决执行毛主席“斗私，批修”的指示，勇敢地肩负起改造客观世界和主观世界的两副重担，既当批修的闯将，又作斗私的模范。
    斗私，就要象年四旺同志那样，勤奋、刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，狠学狠用“老三篇”。时刻用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，用毛主席教导的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，从灵魂深处检查自己，努力使自己从几千年来剥削阶级的“私”字的影响下解放出来，成为一个毫无自私自利之心的共产主义战士。
    斗私，就要象年四旺同志那样，采取主动进攻的态度，对“私”字自觉地打进攻战，狠抓“一闪念”。决不采取姑息、让步、迁就的态度。“私”字一露头，即使是一闪而过的私心杂念，都要狠狠地揪住它，消灭它。
      “公”和“私”，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想，两军对战，不是这个吃掉那个，就是那个吃掉这个。只有象年四旺同志那样，头脑里只准有“公”字的地盘，不准“私”字有一丝一毫的地盘，才能真正破私立公，改造世界观。
    让我们以年四旺同志为榜样，乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，大破私心杂念，加强思想革命化，保证我们的社会主义祖国千秋万代不出修正主义，永葆革命青春！
