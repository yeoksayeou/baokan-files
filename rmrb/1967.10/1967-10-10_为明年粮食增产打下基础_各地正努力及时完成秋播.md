According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Tirana, the Albanian News Agency reported: In northern Albania, such as Korça and Pogradec, large-scale sowing of wheat and other grain crops has begun. This year, the sowing area of wheat accounts for about 80% of the total area of autumn-sown crops. Wheat holds an important position in Albania's grain production. This autumn, members of agricultural cooperatives and workers of state-owned agricultural enterprises have decided to sow more wheat than in any previous year, increasing the area by 65% compared to 1960.

To increase production, the Albanian government has taken and is continuing to take various important measures. This year, the state has allocated more selected seeds to the cooperatives, and in the fields where wheat is sown, domestic newly-built factories have produced high-quality fertilizers such as phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers.

This year, the total number of tractors in agricultural cooperatives and state-owned agricultural enterprises has increased to 8,900, which is 16% more than in 1965 and 97% more than in 1960.

    为明年粮食增产打下基础
    各地正努力及时完成秋播
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：在阿尔巴尼亚的北方如科尔察、波格拉迪茨等地，已开始大规模播种小麦等粮食作物。今年，小麦的播种面积约占各种秋播作物总面积的百分之八十。小麦在阿尔巴尼亚的粮食生产中占有重要地位。今年秋季，农业合作社社员和国营农业企业的工人决定播种小麦的面积超过以往任何一年，比一九六○年扩大百分之六十五。
    为了增加产量，阿尔巴尼亚政府采取了并且正在采取各项重要措施。今年，国家拨给合作社的农民更多选过的种子，并且在播种小麦的地里，使用了国内新建成的工厂生产的磷肥和氮肥等好肥料。
    今年，在农业合作社和国营农业企业的地里，拖拉机的总数已增加到八千九百台，这个数字比一九六五年增加了百分之十六，比一九六○年增加了百分之九十七。
