The Peking opera "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother" is a poisonous weed that propagates the philosophy of traitors. It praises a traitor who surrendered to the enemy, Yang Si Lang, with sympathy and admiration.

This coward, who fears death, was captured by the Liao soldiers. To save his life, he knelt down before the enemy. The Peking opera "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother," however, goes to great lengths to invent a "pretended surrender" theory, allowing him to shamelessly declare: "Since I have been captured, dying would be of no benefit to the country. It is better to comply and stay in this foreign land, to learn about their movements and plan revenge. Isn't this an opportunity?" It strives to justify his act of betrayal.

This shameless individual, who has no national dignity, after betraying his country, is grateful to the enemy and sings praises for them, vowing "to become a dog or a horse in the next life, repaying with grass and jade." The Peking opera, however, tries every means to cover up his treacherous behavior, claiming he is "like a caged bird with wings unable to spread" or "like a tiger separated from the mountain, feeling lonely." In short, his surrender is "forced by circumstances," and he is loyal to his country.

The Peking opera "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother" praises this traitor in a disgusting manner!

However, it is precisely this traitorous play that has received the praise and applause of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The Chinese Khrushchev is the protector and propagandist of "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother."

In April 1949, when the gunfire of the People's Liberation War was still echoing, the Chinese Khrushchev hurried to Tianjin. On one hand, he advocated the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is beneficial," and on the other hand, he issued a permit for "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother," saying, "It's fine to propagate feudalism. We have been victorious for thousands of years... 'Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother' can be performed."

In 1956, after the 20th Congress of the CPSU had just concluded, and the modern revisionist traitor clique had just seized the leadership of the Soviet party and state, at this time, the Chinese Khrushchev, sensing the opportunity, brought out the corpse of Yang Si Lang again, saying, "'Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother' can be sung without any problem. It has been sung for so many years, and hasn't it sung out a new China?"

In 1961, when our country was facing temporary economic difficulties and intense class struggle both domestically and internationally, and when the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan were stirring, the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang jumped out again to support "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother," and absurdly claimed that watching "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother" would not lead to "running to Taiwan to surrender."

Why does the Chinese Khrushchev repeatedly praise this traitorous play, running around and shouting, trying every means to bring out the corpse of Yang Si Lang? What is the reason behind this?

Traitors love traitors. It turns out that the Chinese Khrushchev and many of his accomplices are traitors, the "Yang Si Langs" of the 20th century. In 1936, the Chinese Khrushchev instigated some people to betray the party and surrender to the enemy. The Chinese Khrushchev is the leader of this traitor group. Sharing the same fate, they sympathize with each other. "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother" expresses the voices of this traitor group, venting their reactionary feelings of betraying the proletarian revolutionary cause, becoming their political trumpet for advocating class and national surrenderism. It is precisely for this reason that the traitor group led by the Chinese Khrushchev and the traitor Yang Si Lang from several hundred years ago have a deep understanding and immediately agree with each other.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The Chinese Khrushchev repeatedly propagates this traitorous play and repeatedly waves the flag of Yang Si Lang, aiming to use this historical ghost to support his traitor group, to encourage the big and small "Yang Si Langs" in real life to "feel at ease" in engaging in evil deeds of betraying the proletarian revolutionary cause; to use this corpse to create counter-revolutionary public opinion for his party usurpation, to pave the way for the full restoration of capitalism in China by fully betraying the proletarian revolutionary cause.

"Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother" is a sugar-coated bullet, a highly toxic drug disguised with an attractive label. Under the pretext of "humanity," "filial piety," and other "humanitarian" slogans, it propagates the theories of surrenderism, traitorism, and the philosophy of survival, thus increasing its harmfulness and deceptiveness.

Look, this traitor Yang Si Lang, who recognizes the enemy as his own, is so full of "humanity": he "thinks of his old mother and his heart aches"; he "cannot bear to part with his six younger brothers, who are talented"; he "cannot bear to part with his two younger sisters, who have not yet left the house"; he "cannot bear to part with his wife, with whom he has shared life." The Yang family, towards such a national disgrace, not only has no condemnation, but instead loves him deeply, caring for him thoroughly, and even feels grateful to the national enemy for sparing this soft-bodied creature's life: "Looking towards the enemy country, deeply bowing, the virtuous daughter-in-law cannot come."

Here, the sharp contradictions and life-and-death struggles between the invaders and the invaded, the patriots and the traitors, are all covered and dissolved by "family affection" and "ethical love." The most vicious part is that it covers the extremely ugly face and extremely filthy soul of the traitor Yang Si Lang with a veil of "emotional entanglement," attempting to inject a reactionary political content of "pity," "respect," and "love" for the traitor through such "artistic" depiction.

"The heart has a tacit understanding." The Chinese Khrushchev is so enthusiastic about promoting "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother" because the cover of "humanitarianism" for this poisonous weed, which propagates the theory of traitors, is particularly suitable for the political needs of this party usurper to promote the philosophy of traitors.

The Chinese Khrushchev uses reactionary "humanitarianism" to oppose the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought of class struggle, vigorously advocating the fallacy of "super-class" "personality" and "conscience." He says: "Capitalists and workers are equal in personality... Positions can be different, but personalities are not." He also says: Throughout history, there have been many classes, so from progressive and revolutionary to reactionary, it is because it "initially lacked conscience," "conscience is covered by something, making it unable to see the truth," "it cannot help but lie, cannot help but go against conscience." According to this fallacy, traitors and revolutionaries have equal "personality," and traitors also have "conscience." Traitors become traitors only because of "a moment of weakness," making the "pure" "conscience" covered with a layer of dust. Once following the methods of the Chinese Khrushchev's "Cultivation," reflecting in the enemy's "reflection room," or like Yang Si Lang, sitting in the palace "thinking and sighing," the dust can be wiped off, the soul purified, the original "personality" restored, and the "conscience" rediscovered. Thus, traitors can become revolutionaries, bears can become heroes, and filthy and ugly souls can become pure and noble. This is pure deception!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Is there such a thing as humanity? Of course, there is. But there is only specific humanity, not abstract humanity. In a class society, there is only humanity with class characteristics, and no such thing as super-class humanity." Similarly, in a class society, there is fundamentally no such thing as super-class "personality" and "conscience." The Chinese Khrushchev's deceitful teachings about "personality" and "conscience" are to make the reactionary nature he represents seem like super-class "common humanity," to give the filthy souls of traitors a beautiful shell.

Traitors are traitors. Whether they are the dead like Yang Si Lang or the living "Yang Si Langs" like the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk, they are all despicable piles of dog shit. To save their own skins, they are willing to betray the interests of the nation and the people, kneeling down before the enemy, willingly becoming the enemy's accomplices and spies, doing all kinds of evil, and deserving to be executed. They are a despicable and contemptible bunch, how can they talk about having "personality"? They have black hearts that bring disaster to the country, how can they have "conscience"?

The Chinese Khrushchev also created such absurd theories: "'Being a person' requires handling various relationships properly, having a specific stance: 'wife's stance,' 'husband's stance,' 'mother's stance,' 'son's stance,' etc." This is utterly absurd. The stance we talk about can only be class stance, either proletarian or bourgeois, one of the two. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, completely denies the class nature of people. According to his fallacy, standing in the "mother's stance," one should love their son, even if he is a traitor, one should love him like Auntie Zhao, "seeing the beloved son, tears fill the face, drop by drop, falling down"; standing in the "wife's stance," one should love their husband, even if he is a traitor, one should love him like Yang Si Lang's wife, "holding the husband's hand, not letting go, if you come, take me with you." The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the "wife's stance," "husband's stance," "mother's stance," "son's stance," attempting to cover up people's class nature with "family affection" and "ethical love," making revolutionary people, regardless of class boundaries, love the enemy, love traitors, and create counter-revolutionary public opinion for this small group of enemies of the people and traitors of the proletariat, to "smoothly" realize their evil plot of usurping the party, the army, and the government.

The Chinese Khrushchev's fondness for traitorous plays like "Yang Si Lang Visits His Mother" and admiration for traitors like Yang Si Lang is not accidental but stems from his reactionary class instincts and counter-revolutionary needs. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not be deceived by the pretext of "humanity," not be deceived by the teachings of "love for humanity." Whether the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang of foxes and dogs appear in their true demonic form, cover themselves with a veil of "love for humanity," or pretend to be harmless and pitiful, we will not be soft-hearted. We must bury the number one traitor, the Chinese Khrushchev, along with his traitor philosophy.

　　《四郎探母》和中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学
　　劈资　洪晓桂
    京剧《四郎探母》是一出宣扬叛徒哲学的大毒草。它以同情和赞美的笔调，歌颂了一个投敌变节的叛徒——杨四郎。
    就是这个贪生怕死的软骨头。当他被辽兵俘虏后，为了活命，乖乖地跪倒在敌人的脚下。京剧《四郎探母》却挖空心思抬出一个“伪降”说，让他大言不惭地表白：“吾既被擒，死亦无益于国，不如应允，留在他国，或知此中动静，徐图报仇，岂不是机会乎？”竭力为他的变节行为开脱。
    就是这个毫无民族气节的无耻之徒，当他投敌之后，对民族的敌人感恩戴德，恬不知耻地为他们大唱赞美诗，并发誓“到来生变犬马结草衔环”，以示忠心。京剧却想方设法为他的叛卖行为掩饰，什么他“好比笼中鸟有翅难展”呀，什么他“好比虎离山受了孤单”呀。一句话，他的投降是“环境所迫”，他对祖国是忠贞不二的。
    京剧《四郎探母》对这个叛徒的吹捧实在令人作呕！
    然而，就是这样一出叛徒戏，却得到了中国赫鲁晓夫的啧啧赞赏，喝彩叫好。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是《四郎探母》的护法神和吹鼓手。
    一九四九年四月，人民解放战争的炮声还在隆隆地响着，就在这个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫赶忙跑到天津，一方面鼓吹“剥削有功”的反动谬论，同时为《四郎探母》发放通行证，说什么“宣传封建，不怕。几千年了，我们不是胜利了？……《四郎探母》可以演”。
    一九五六年，苏共二十大刚刚“收场”，现代修正主义叛徒集团刚刚篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导权，就在这时候，中国赫鲁晓夫又闻风而动，把杨四郎这具僵尸又一次抬了出来，说什么“《四郎探母》唱唱也不要紧，唱了这么多年，不是唱出个新中国吗？”
    一九六一年，正当我国经济处于暂时困难、国内外阶级斗争十分尖锐，龟缩在台湾的蒋匪帮也蠢蠢欲动的时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的一伙，再一次跳出来为《四郎探母》保驾，并且胡说什么看了《四郎探母》不会“跑到台湾去投降”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为什么一而再，再而三地吹捧这出叛徒戏，到处奔走呼号，想方设法把杨四郎这具僵尸抬出来呢？这究竟是为什么呢？
    叛徒爱叛徒。原来中国赫鲁晓夫和他的许多同伙都是叛徒，都是二十世纪的“杨四郎”。中国赫鲁晓夫在一九三六年，策动一些人叛党投敌。中国赫鲁晓夫就是这个叛徒集团的总头目。同病相怜，物伤其类，
  《四郎探母》唱出了这伙叛徒的心声，抒发了他们出卖无产阶级革命事业的反动感情，成了他们鼓吹阶级投降主义和民族投降主义的政治号筒。正是出于这个原因，使以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的叛徒集团和几百年前的叛徒杨四郎心心相印，一拍即合。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”中国赫鲁晓夫所以一再宣扬这出叛徒戏，一再把杨四郎当做旗帜来挥舞，其目的，就是要用这个历史的亡灵给他的叛徒集团撑腰，为现实生活中大大小小的“杨四郎”打气，鼓励他们“心安理得”地从事背叛无产阶级革命事业的罪恶勾当；就是要利用这具僵尸为他叛党篡党制造反革命舆论，为实现他对无产阶级革命事业的大出卖，大背叛，在中国全面复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    《四郎探母》是糖衣裹着的炮弹，是用迷人的商标装潢起来的烈性毒药。它在“人情味”、“儿女情长”等等“人性论”的幌子下，宣扬投降主义、叛徒理论和活命哲学，这就更增加了它的毒害性和欺骗性。
    你看，这个认贼为亲的叛徒杨四郎多么富有“人情味”：他“思老母不由人肝肠痛断”；他“舍不得六贤弟将英才”，“舍不得二贤妹未出闺门外”，“舍不得结发夫妻两分开”。而杨门一家对这样一个民族败类，不仅没有丝毫的谴责，反而一往情深，抚爱备至，甚至为这个软体动物能保留一条狗命，而对民族的死敌感激涕零：“眼望番邦深深拜，贤德的媳妇不能来”。
    在这里，被侵略者和侵略者，爱国者和汉奸叛徒的尖锐矛盾和生死搏斗，都被“骨肉之情”、“伦理之爱”所掩盖、所消溶了。特别恶毒的是它给杨四郎这个叛徒汉奸的极端丑恶的嘴脸和极端卑污的灵魂，蒙上了一层“情丝缠绵”的面纱，企图通过这样的“艺术”描写，贯注一种叛徒“可怜”、“可敬”、“可爱”的反动政治内容。
    “心有灵犀一点通”。中国的赫鲁晓夫所以这样卖力地鼓吹《四郎探母》，是因为这棵大毒草宣扬汉奸理论的遮羞布“人性论”，特别适合于他这个篡党野心家鼓吹叛徒哲学的政治需要。
    中国赫鲁晓夫用反动的“人性论”来对抗马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阶级斗争论，大肆宣扬超阶级的“人格”、“良心”之类的谬论。他说：“资本家和工人在人格上是平等的，……职务可以有区别，人格却没有区别。”他还说：历史上有很多阶级，所以由进步、革命变为反动，就是因为它“开始没有良心了”，“良心蒙上一层东西，使它看不见真理”，“它就不能不撒谎，不能不违背良心。”按照这种谬论，叛徒和革命者都具有平等的“人格”，叛徒也是有“良心”的。叛徒所以当了叛徒，只是由于“一念之差”，使“纯洁”的“良心”蒙上了一层灰尘。而一旦按照中国赫鲁晓夫《修养》的办法，在敌人的“反省院”里“反省”一番，或者象杨四郎那样坐在宫院里“自思自叹”一阵，就可以揩去灰尘，纯化灵魂，恢复固有的“人格”，使“良心”重新发现。于是乎，叛徒就可以变成革命者，狗熊就可以变成英雄，卑污丑恶的灵魂就可以变得纯洁而崇高。这纯粹是欺人之谈！
    毛主席教导我们：“有没有人性这种东西？当然有的。但是只有具体的人性，没有抽象的人性。在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性。”同样，在阶级社会里也根本没有什么超阶级的“人格”和“良心”。中国赫鲁晓夫关于“人格”、“良心”之类骗人的说教，就是要把他所代表的资产阶级的反动性，说成是超阶级的“共同人性”，就是要给叛徒的肮脏的灵魂，配置一副美丽的躯壳。
    叛徒就是叛徒。无论是死去的杨四郎之类，还是活着的“杨四郎”——中国赫鲁晓夫之流，统统是不齿于人类的狗屎堆。他们为了保住一条狗命，不惜出卖民族和人民的利益，甘心跪拜在敌人的脚下，甘心为敌人充当帮凶和内奸，干尽坏事，罪不容诛。这是一群可憎可鄙的无耻之徒，哪里还谈得上有什么“人格”！他们长着一副祸国殃民的黑心肠，哪里还会有什么“良心”发现！
    中国赫鲁晓夫还制造了这样一种奇谈怪论：“‘做人’要妥善的处理各方面的关系，要有具体的立场：‘老婆立场’、‘丈夫立场’、‘母亲立场’、‘儿子立场’”等等。真是荒唐透顶。我们说的立场只能是阶级的立场，不是无产阶级的立场，就是资产阶级的立场，二者必居其一。中国赫鲁晓夫却根本否定人的阶级性，按照他的这种谬论，站在“母亲立场”，就应当爱儿子，即使他是叛徒，也要象佘太君那样“一见娇儿泪满腮，点点珠泪洒下来”；站在“老婆立场”，就应当爱丈夫，即使他是汉奸，也要象杨四郎的老婆那样，“手拉儿夫不放开，你若走来将我带”。中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“老婆立场”、“丈夫立场”、“母亲立场”、“儿子立场”，就是妄图以“骨肉之情”，“伦理之爱”掩盖人的阶级性，要革命人民不分阶级界限，去爱敌人，去爱叛徒这类社会的渣滓，为他们这一小撮人民的死敌、无产阶级的叛徒，制造反革命的舆论，以便“顺利地”实现其篡党篡军篡政的罪恶阴谋。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所以癖爱《四郎探母》这样的叛徒戏，欣赏杨四郎之类的无耻之徒，决不是偶然的，是出于他反动的阶级本能和反革命的需要。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决不为“人性”的幌子所迷惑，决不为“人类之爱”的说教所欺骗。不管中国赫鲁晓夫及其狐群狗党以凶神恶煞的本来面目出现也好，蒙上一层“人类之爱”的面纱也好，装出一副无害而且可怜的样子也好，我们都决不讲“人情”，决不讲“博爱”，决不能手软。我们一定要把头号大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫连同他的叛徒哲学一起埋葬。
