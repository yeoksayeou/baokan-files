Title: Seeing the Ugly Soul of the Soviet Revisionists Through Two Paintings

From two propaganda posters of the Soviet revisionists, one can clearly see how the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin fervently advocates material incentives, proclaims the ruble as the "powerful locomotive" driving everything, and promotes the reactionary bourgeois ideology that money can buy everything.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "A certain culture is the reflection in the realm of ideas of a certain society's politics and economics."

These two posters are a reflection of the reality of Soviet society under modern revisionism. The souls of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk, tainted by the stench of money, loudly proclaim that money is all-powerful and frantically push the ruble to the forefront. In every sector of the Soviet national economy, they vigorously promote the so-called "new system" with the pursuit of profits as the highest principle. They even extend this capitalist principle of material incentives to literature and art, education, scientific research, and ideological work. The Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol solemnly passed a resolution to establish an "incentive fund" to stimulate the "initiative" of cadre members. In short, in all aspects of Soviet politics, economics, ideology, and culture, everything revolves around material incentives and the ruble.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique and the bourgeois privileged stratum they represent have money on their minds and dream of money. For the sake of greed and profit, they are capable of any evil and any dirty deal. Marxism-Leninism, revolutionary principles—all are thrown to the winds.

For money, they engage in hiring labor, free competition, black market transactions, and operate "underground factories" to seize the maximum profit.

For money, they even open pawnshops, exploit the working people, and engage in usury.

For money, they supply strategic materials for making airplanes and bombs to the American bandits who are slaughtering the Vietnamese people, exchanging the blood of revolutionary people for dollars.

For money, they shamelessly turn the fiftieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution into a money-making scheme, attracting Western tourists to make dollars, pounds, francs, and marks.

Engels said: "In the eyes of the bourgeoisie, nothing in the world exists except for money, and they themselves are no exception, for they live only to make money." The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has completely degenerated into the money-grubbing bourgeois merchants vividly depicted by Engels. They have turned the first socialist state in the world, built by Lenin and Stalin, into a decaying and falling capitalist state that kneels before the god of wealth. This is the greatest betrayal of the October Revolution.

Our deputy commander Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: The essence of the old culture and old ideas is that they are old in private ownership, old in the word "private."

The word "private" is the root of all evil, the source of capitalism and revisionism. Revisionism is the inevitable result of the malignant development of the word "private." The Soviet revisionist clique fervently advocates that profit is above all, that the ruble is the driving force, and promotes material incentives and the supremacy of cash. They wildly advocate the word "private," inflate the word "private," to serve their destruction of the socialist public economy and their full-scale restoration of capitalism. Ultimately, it is to facilitate the exploitation and oppression of the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union by the Soviet bourgeois privileged stratum, so that their pockets are filled with more and more money; it is to facilitate the maintenance of their revisionist rule.

The revisionist line centered on the word "private" promoted by the Soviet revisionist clique and the bourgeois privileged stratum they represent has greatly poisoned the Soviet people, especially the younger generation.

Under the drive of the word "private" and the principle of the ruble, evil breeds in Soviet society. Harming others for personal gain, embezzlement and corruption, speculation, murder for profit, robbery, and other vices have become the norm. For the sake of the ruble, some people, when a fire breaks out, only save their own piglets, letting their neighbors' children burn to death. For the sake of the ruble, some lifeguard stations, when seeing someone drowning, do not rescue them because of "economic accounting." Is it not the ruble, which Brezhnev and Kosygin worship, that drives the widespread bourgeois ideology and the outbreak of capitalist crimes? Is it not the full-scale restoration of capitalism?

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique plays the whore and wants to set up a shrine. The mess they make is clearly a full-scale restoration of capitalism, but they shamelessly boast that it is a "new creation" to "strengthen and develop socialism," marking a "new stage" in the Soviet Union's advance toward communism. They even make a big fuss, using the so-called "commemoration activities" of the October Revolution anniversary, to whitewash their ugly deeds. This is a great insult to the October Revolution.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, proposing the great battle program of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism: "Criticize the private, oppose revisionism." Chairman Mao has always taught us: Politics is the commander, the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposed and overthrew the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road headed by China's Khrushchev, further highlighted proletarian politics, smashed the word "private," established the word "public," smashed bourgeois ideology, established Mao Zedong Thought, achieved the revolutionization of people's ideology, and thus drove everything forward, creating one miracle after another of turning spiritual power into material power, promoting the development of our socialist society. The true, the good, and the beautiful always exist and develop in comparison and struggle with the false, the evil, and the ugly. The Soviet people will certainly be enlightened by the great teacher of the world's people, Chairman Mao, leading New China, see through the fake communism and true capitalism of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, rise up in rebellion, rise up in revolution, overthrow the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and the bourgeois privileged stratum they represent, and bring the Soviet Union back onto the socialist track!

    从两幅画看苏修的丑恶灵魂
    向东
    从苏修两幅宣传画中，人们可以清楚地看到：以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修领导集团，是怎样狂热地宣扬物质刺激，宣扬卢布是带动一切的“强有力的火车头”，宣扬有了金钱就有了一切的资产阶级反动思想。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“一定的文化是一定社会的政治和经济在观念形态上的反映。”
    这两幅画，正是现代修正主义统治下的苏联社会现实的一种反映。被铜臭染污了灵魂的勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，大肆鼓吹金钱万能，拚命推行卢布挂帅。他们在苏联国民经济的各部门，大张旗鼓地推行以追逐利润为最高原则的所谓
  “新体制”，并且把这种物质刺激的资本主义原则，推广到了文学艺术、学校教育、科学研究以至思想工作等意识形态领域里。苏联共青团中央，竟为刺激团干部的所谓“积极性”，郑重其事地通过了一个建立“奖励基金”的决议。总之，在苏联政治、经济、思想、文化等等一切方面，无一不是物质刺激，无一不是卢布挂帅。
    苏修统治集团及其所代表的资产阶级特权阶层，满脑子装的是钱，做梦想的也是钱。为了贪财图利，什么坏事也做得出来，什么卑鄙肮脏的勾当也干得出来。什么马克思列宁主义，什么革命原则，统统抛到了九霄云外。
    为了钱，他们大搞雇工剥削，大搞自由竞争，大搞黑市交易，大办“地下工厂”，以攫取最大限度的利润。
    为了钱，他们竟然大开当铺，盘剥工农劳动群众，干起放债吃利息的营生。
    为了钱，他们把制造飞机、炸弹的稀有战略物资大量送货上门，以应屠杀越南人民的美国强盗的急需，竟然拿革命人民的鲜血去换取美元。
    为了钱，他们竟然无耻地把十月社会主义革命五十周年这个节日，作为生财之道，大做游览生意，招揽西方顾客，来捞取美元、英镑、法郎、马克。
    恩格斯说过：“在资产阶级看来，世界上没有一样东西不是为了金钱而存在的，连他们本身也不例外，因为他们活着就是为了赚钱”。苏修统治集团完全堕落成了恩格斯所生动刻划的唯利是图的资产阶级商人。他们把列宁、斯大林所缔造起来的世界上第一个社会主义国家，演变成了拜倒在财神脚下的腐朽没落的资本主义国家。这是对十月革命的最大背叛。
    我们的副统帅林彪同志指出：旧文化、旧思想这些东西，最本质的旧，就是旧在私有制上，旧在一个“私”字上。
      “私”字是万恶之源，是产生资本主义、修正主义的根子。修正主义是“私”字恶性发展的必然结果。苏修集团狂热地鼓吹利润高于一切，卢布就是动力，大搞物质刺激，大搞钞票挂帅，大肆宣扬“人不为己，天诛地灭”、“有钱能使鬼推磨”的信条，正是疯狂鼓吹“私”字，让“私”字大大膨胀，来为他们破坏社会主义公有经济、全面复辟资本主义服务。归根结底，就是为了便于苏联资产阶级特权阶层剥削压榨苏联广大劳动人民，使他们的腰包里装满更多更多的钱；就是为了便于维护他们的修正主义统治。
    苏修集团及其所代表的资产阶级特权阶层所推行的以“私”字为核心的修正主义路线，极大地毒害了苏联人民，毒害了苏联年青的一代。
    在“私”字的推动下，在卢布挂帅原则的推动下，苏联社会罪恶孳生。损人利己，损公肥私，贪污腐化，投机倒把，谋财害命，行凶抢劫，等等，已成风气。为了卢布，有人在失火的时候，只顾抢救自己的小猪崽，任凭邻居的小孩活活烧死。为了卢布，有的救生站，在看到有人落水的时候，竟因为“经济核算”而见死不救。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流顶礼膜拜的卢布所带动的，不正是资产阶级思想的大泛滥，资本主义罪恶的大发作吗？不正是资本主义的大复辟吗？
    苏修统治集团又当婊子，又要想立牌坊。他们搞的乌七八糟的这一套，明明是全面复辟资本主义，却恬不知耻地吹嘘是“加强和发展社会主义”的“新创造”，标志着苏联“在向共产主义道路上前进的新阶段”。他们甚至吹吹打打，借十月革命节的所谓“纪念活动”，为自己的丑行涂脂抹粉。这是对十月革命的莫大污辱。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，提出了巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的伟大战斗纲领：“斗私，批修”。毛主席一贯教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中，揭露和打倒了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，进一步突出无产阶级政治，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，实现人的思想革命化，从而带动了一切，创造了一个又一个精神变物质的伟大奇迹，推动了我国社会主义社会向前发展。真的、善的、美的东西总是在同假的、恶的、丑的东西相比较而存在，相斗争而发展的。苏联人民一定会从世界人民的伟大导师毛主席领导下的新中国得到启示，识破苏修领导集团所搞的假共产主义、真资本主义的那一套，起来造反，起来革命，把苏修领导集团及其所代表的资产阶级特权阶层打翻在地，使苏联重新回到社会主义的轨道上来！　（原载二十四日《解放军报》）
