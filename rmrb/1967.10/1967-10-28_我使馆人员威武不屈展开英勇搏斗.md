The Indonesian fascist military regime led by Suharto-Nasution dispatched a large number of armed military police and over a thousand thugs to launch a shocking armed attack on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on October 1st. This incident is one of the rare fascist atrocities in the history of international diplomatic relations.

The twenty members of the Chinese Embassy, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, fought bravely with their bare hands to defend the dignity of our motherland and the cause of justice for humanity. All of them were honorably wounded in the process.

The Indonesian fascist military regime deliberately chose the day of the glorious national holiday of the Chinese people—the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—to commit this unprecedented fascist atrocity. This is a grave provocation against the great seven hundred million Chinese people and irrefutable evidence of their deliberate sabotage of relations between the two countries!

In the early hours of October 1st, over a thousand thugs, with the support of a large number of armed military police, used armored vehicles to break down the gates of the Chinese Embassy, climbed onto the roof, and rushed into the rooms, firing carbines, rifles, and pistols into every room. The twenty members of the Chinese Embassy, fearless of sacrifice and undaunted by the enemy's strength, put up a heroic resistance. The savage Indonesian fascist thugs and reactionary military police opened fire on the unarmed Chinese embassy staff, wounding four Chinese diplomats on the spot. The Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires Huang Wen-sheng was shot in the right abdomen, sustaining serious injuries. The interpreter Dai Yongbao was shot in the right shoulder, and the comrades Qian Kangsheng and Zhou Qinglong were also wounded by gunfire. Other members of the Chinese Embassy were either stabbed or beaten with knives, iron bars, and other weapons. The armed military police and thugs also looted, smashed, and burned various equipment in the embassy, thoroughly destroying the Chinese Embassy. The armed military police and thugs even brazenly tore down the Chinese national flag, burned it, and hoisted the Indonesian flag in the courtyard of the Chinese Embassy. They even went so far as to throw the portrait of the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" into the fire and burn them.

After this bloody incident, the Indonesian military police openly abducted all the embassy staff and illegally occupied the embassy for eleven hours. The twenty red diplomatic fighters of the Chinese Embassy, when they were forcibly taken away from the embassy, shouted all the way, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and shouted slogans protesting against the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries. When the representative of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry was forced to go to the hospital, the seriously injured Chargé d'Affaires of our country, Huang Wen-sheng, lodged the most urgent, most severe, and strongest protest against the Indonesian fascist military regime for their mad anti-China atrocities.

The official mouthpiece of the Indonesian government, the Antara News Agency, and the right-wing newspapers in Jakarta reported on October 2nd about the armed attack on the Chinese Embassy, which is a confession of the anti-China crimes of the Indonesian fascist military regime. They admitted that this anti-China atrocity was carried out by the "Indonesian University Students Action Front" and the "Indonesian Youth Students Action Front," which have been carrying out anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people riots all over Indonesia for the past two years, in close collaboration with the armed forces. The military mouthpiece "Angkatan Bersenjata" admitted that the right-wing army and thugs carried out a "large-scale attack" on the Chinese Embassy, a "quite intense armed" attack. Subsequently, the thugs held a so-called "victory rally," tore down the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China, and "raised the red and white flag (referring to the Indonesian flag)... The five-star red flag and the portrait of Chairman Mao were all torn to pieces." The "Independent" newspaper even maliciously said that this armed attack and occupation of the Chinese Embassy was a "gift from the Indonesian people to the Beijing government on the occasion of celebrating its revolutionary anniversary today, a memorable and truly special gift." This is a great insult to the heroic people of Indonesia, to the great Chinese people, and to the People's Republic of China, and it is intolerable!

After a fierce struggle, part of the Chinese Embassy staff, who were forcibly taken away, returned to the embassy at midnight on the same day. They defied the brutality of the Indonesian reactionaries, tore down the red and white flag in the courtyard of the embassy, and solemnly raised the five-star red flag again, carrying their wounds and entering a new battle.

After organizing the armed forces and thugs to launch a mad attack on the Chinese Embassy, the Indonesian fascist military regime immediately dispatched heavy troops to impose a strict armed blockade on the Chinese Embassy, completely depriving the embassy staff of their personal freedom, cutting off all communication between the embassy and the Chinese government, and cutting off the supply of water, electricity, and gas. They even stipulated that without the permission of the Jakarta military authorities and the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, no one was allowed to visit the seriously injured Chargé d'Affaires Huang Wen-sheng and the other four comrades in the hospital, nor were the Chinese Embassy staff allowed to escort other seriously injured comrades to the hospital for treatment. The Chinese Embassy staff repeatedly requested to meet with the responsible officials of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry to negotiate the above-mentioned fascist actions. But this reasonable request was unreasonably obstructed by the reactionary armed military police surrounding the Chinese Embassy. To break through the armed blockade, on the 3rd, four members of the Chinese Embassy, with the wounds inflicted by the Indonesian thugs and reactionary military police, bandaged their heads and wore blood-stained clothes, stood proudly in front of the embassy, struggling with the reactionary military police for two and a half hours. They loudly protested and condemned the Indonesian reactionaries' heinous anti-China crimes while shouting the slogan "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" Thousands of Jakarta citizens crowded in front of the Chinese Embassy, witnessing the injuries of the Chinese diplomats and listening to their accusations against the Indonesian reactionaries. On the 6th, four Chinese diplomats, despite the threat of force from the reactionary military police, held up placards and stood again on the sidewalk in front of the embassy, angrily exposing the unreasonable actions of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, which had been refusing to receive the Chinese diplomats. Their placards read: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Strongest protest against the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian government!" "Strongest protest against the Indonesian government's blockade and siege of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China!" "Strongest protest against the Indonesian government's arbitrary prohibition of our visit to the hospital to see our seriously injured Chargé d'Affaires and other comrades!" The unyielding and daring-to-fight spirit of the Chinese diplomats won the sympathy and praise of many Jakarta citizens.

It is reported that the heroic struggle of the Chinese Embassy diplomats has received the warm concern of the ambassadors and diplomats from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Romania, Afghanistan, Syria, Cuba, Pakistan, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stationed in Jakarta. They came to the Chinese Embassy, expressing their sympathy and respect to the Chinese diplomats who were fighting bravely there. Some ambassadors even brought medicine, food, and clothes to the Chinese Embassy staff who were in difficult conditions. At 9 a.m. on the 2nd, the Chargé d'Affaires and diplomats of the Vietnamese Embassy in Indonesia brought food to visit the Chinese comrades but were unreasonably stopped by the Indonesian reactionary military police at the gate. The Chinese Embassy diplomats, dressed in blood-stained clothes, bravely went out to welcome them.

The shocking anti-China atrocity committed by the Indonesian fascist military regime has made the historical fascist bandits of Hitler and Japanese militarism pale in comparison. But this does not indicate its strength; it is only its death throes. As our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rampancy of all internal and external dark forces causes national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows their last struggles, indicating that the people are gradually approaching victory."

    印尼反动派出动大批军警暴徒武装袭击我使馆
    我使馆人员威武不屈展开英勇搏斗
    我外交人员不畏强暴敢于斗争的英雄气概博得雅加达市民的同情和赞扬
    据新华社二十七日讯  本社记者报道：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权，十月一日出动大批武装军警和一千多名暴徒，对中国驻印尼大使馆进行了骇人听闻的武装袭击，制造了国际外交关系史上少有的法西斯暴行。
    中国大使馆全体人员二十名，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，为捍卫祖国尊严和人类正义事业，赤手空拳，同印尼反动武装军警和暴徒展开了英勇的搏斗，全部光荣负伤。
    印尼法西斯军人政权特意选择在中国人民光辉节日——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年之际，制造这一空前的法西斯暴行，是对伟大七亿中国人民的极其严重挑衅，是蓄意破坏两国关系的铁证！
    十月一日凌晨，这一千多名暴徒在大批武装军警的配合下用装甲车破坏中国大使馆大门，爬到屋顶，冲到室内，用卡宾枪、步枪和手枪，对每一个房间进行了射击。中国大使馆全体人员二十名不怕牺牲，不畏强暴，进行了英勇的抵抗。残暴成性的印尼法西斯暴徒和反动军警，对手无寸铁的中国大使馆人员开枪射击，当场击伤四名中国外交人员。中国大使馆临时代办黄文胜右腹中弹，伤势很重，翻译戴永保右肩中弹，严堃生和周庆隆二同志也被枪弹击伤。中国大使馆其他人员都被刀、铁棍和其它利器刺伤或击伤。武装军警和暴徒们还抢劫、砸毁和焚烧大使馆的各种设备，对中国大使馆进行了彻底的破坏。武装军警和暴徒竟悍然扯下中国国旗，加以焚毁，并在中国大使馆院内扯起印尼国旗。他们甚至丧心病狂地把全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像和《毛主席语录》扔到火中烧毁。
    在这一血腥事件发生后，印尼军警又公然把大使馆全部人员劫持离馆，非法霸占大使馆达十一小时之久。中国大使馆二十名红色外交战士在被武装劫持离开大使馆时，一路高呼：“毛主席万岁！”高呼抗议印尼反动派法西斯暴行的口号。当印尼外交部代表被迫到医院时，身负重伤的我国临时代办黄文胜就印尼反动派的疯狂反华暴行，向印尼法西斯军人政权提出了最紧急、最严厉、最强烈的抗议。
    印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社和雅加达右派报纸十月二日关于武装袭击中国大使馆的报道，是印尼法西斯军人政权反华罪行的自供状。它们承认，这一反华暴行是两年来在全印尼疯狂进行反华、反共、反人民暴乱活动的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”，在武装部队的密切配合下进行的。陆军喉舌《武装部队报》承认，右派军队和暴徒对中国大使馆进行了“一次大规模袭击”，“相当激烈的武装”袭击。随后，暴徒们举行所谓“胜利大会”，扯下了中华人民共和国五星红旗，“升起了红白旗（指印尼国旗）……五星红旗和毛主席像都被撕毁”。《独立报》竟居心险恶地说什么，这次武装袭击和强占中国大使馆是“印尼人民献给今天庆祝其革命周年纪念日的北京政府的礼物，是令人难忘和真正特别的礼物”。这是对英雄的印尼人民，对伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国的极大污辱，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    经过一场英勇斗争，被武装劫持的中国大使馆部分人员，一日夜间十二时胜利返回使馆。他们藐视印尼反动派的横暴，在大使馆院内愤怒扯下了红白旗，重新升起了无比庄严的五星红旗，带着伤痛，投入了新的战斗。
    印尼法西斯军人政权在组织武装部队和暴徒疯狂袭击中国大使馆后，立即派遣重兵，对中国大使馆实行严密的武装封锁，完全剥夺了大使馆人员的人身自由，切断了大使馆同中国政府的一切电讯联系，断绝了水、电和煤气供应。他们甚至规定未经雅加达军事当局和印尼外交部的许可，任何人不得到医院看望中国临时代办黄文胜等四位重伤人员，也不准中国大使馆人员护送其他重伤人员去医院治疗。中国大使馆人员一再提出要见印尼外交部负责官员，就上述法西斯行径进行交涉。但这一合理要求却受到包围中国大使馆的反动武装军警的无理阻止。为了冲破武装封锁，三日，四名中国大使馆人员带着被印尼暴徒和反动军警毒打的伤痕，头扎绷带，身着血衣，昂立在大使馆门前，同反动军警斗争达两个半小时。他们一面愤怒抗议和谴责印尼反动派疯狂反华的滔天罪行，一面高呼“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”的口号。数以千计的雅加达市民拥挤在中国大使馆前面的街道上，目睹了中国外交人员的伤势，听取了他们对印尼反动派的控诉。六日，四名中国外交人员不顾反动军警的武力威胁，高举标语牌，再次齐立在大使馆门前的人行道上，愤怒揭露印尼外交部一直拒绝接见中国外交人员的无理行径。他们的标语牌上写着：“毛主席万岁！”“最强烈抗议印尼政府的法西斯暴行！”“强烈抗议印尼政府封锁和包围中华人民共和国大使馆！”“强烈抗议印尼政府专横地禁止我们去医院探望我们被枪击重伤的临时代办和其他同志！”中国外交人员不畏强暴、敢于斗争的英雄气概，博得了许多雅加达市民的同情和赞扬。
    据报道，中国大使馆外交人员的英勇斗争，受到了越南民主共和国、罗马尼亚、阿富汗、叙利亚、古巴、巴基斯坦和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等驻雅加达使节和外交官员的热情关怀。他们来到中国大使馆门前，向正在那里进行英勇斗争的中国大使馆外交人员表示慰问和敬意。有些国家的使节还给处在艰苦条件下的中国大使馆人员带来了药品、食物和衣服。二日上午九时，越南驻印尼大使馆临时代办和外交官带着粮食前来看望中国同志，被印尼反动军警无理拦在门外。中国大使馆外交人员身穿血衣，英勇前往迎接。
    印尼法西斯军人政权制造的这一骇人听闻的反华暴行，使历史上横行一时的希特勒法西斯匪徒和日本军国主义者都为之黯然失色。但这绝不说明它的强大，只不过是它的垂死挣扎而已。正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们的：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”
