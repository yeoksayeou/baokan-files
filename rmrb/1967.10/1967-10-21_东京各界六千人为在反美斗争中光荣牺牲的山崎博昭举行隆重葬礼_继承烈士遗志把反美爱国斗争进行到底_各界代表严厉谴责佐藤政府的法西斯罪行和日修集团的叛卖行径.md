Six thousand workers, students, citizens, and representatives from various circles in Tokyo braved heavy rain on the evening of October 17 to hold a grand funeral for Masaki Hiroshi, a Japanese patriotic youth who sacrificed himself in the anti-American struggle. The funeral ceremony was held at the open-air music hall in Hibiya, Tokyo. The reactionary Sato government, fearing that its bloody suppression of the Japanese patriotic youth's anti-American struggle would be further exposed, dispatched 2,000 armed police to surround the music hall in an attempt to intimidate and disrupt the event. However, this fascist violence only fueled greater anger among the Japanese people and representatives from various circles. Undeterred by the threat, they resolutely held the funeral for Masaki.

Japanese prominent figure Sakamoto Tokumatsu, representing the Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee of Japan, the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), and four other progressive organizations, delivered a eulogy at the funeral ceremony. He said: Masaki stood at the forefront of the broad masses of the Japanese people in their struggle against American imperialism and the Sato government's aggression and war policies. Chairman Mao said, "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties. We must raise high the banner of opposing American imperialism, the Sato government, Soviet revisionism, and Japanese revisionism. We must fight on until we defeat the American imperialists' aggressive policies and achieve complete independence for our country.

Renowned historian Inoue Kiyoshi, representing the faculty and staff of Kyoto University, where Masaki studied, also spoke at the funeral ceremony. He said, Masaki's death has inspired the Japanese people and people around the world to fight against American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. We must follow in Masaki's footsteps, inherit his will, and press forward bravely. Inoue strongly condemned the Sato government's fascist crimes and the betrayal of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle by the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda. He pointed out that the Japanese revisionists have become accomplices of the American-Japanese reactionaries.

Representatives who, on October 8, joined Masaki in protesting against Sato's secret activities in South Vietnam at Haneda Airport, representatives from the residents of Sunagawa Town opposing the expansion of the U.S. military base, representatives from the farmers of Sanrizuka opposing Sato's government's seizure of land to build an airport, and representatives from Japanese youth, workers, women, religious circles, as well as the mother of Japanese national hero Kumi Yumi, all spoke at the funeral ceremony.

    东京各界六千人为在反美斗争中光荣牺牲的山崎博昭举行隆重葬礼
    继承烈士遗志把反美爱国斗争进行到底
    各界代表严厉谴责佐藤政府的法西斯罪行和日修集团的叛卖行径
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本工人、学生、市民和各界人士六千人，十七日晚间冒着大雨为在反美斗争中光荣牺牲的日本爱国青年山崎博昭举行隆重的葬礼。葬礼仪式是在东京日比谷露天音乐堂举行的。佐藤反动政府深恐它的血腥镇压日本爱国青年反美斗争的滔天罪行被进一步揭露，竟然派出二千名武装警察包围了音乐堂，阴谋进行恫吓和破坏。但是，这种法西斯暴行激起了日本人民和各界人士的更大的愤怒。他们不畏强暴，斗志昂扬，坚持为山崎举行了葬礼。
    日本著名人士坂本德松代表亚非人民团结日本委员会、日中友好协会（正统）总部、日本记者同盟等五个进步团体在葬礼仪式上致悼辞说：山崎是站在广大日本人民反对美帝国主义和佐藤政府的侵略和战争政策的最前列、进行英勇斗争的民族英雄。毛主席说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。我们应当按照毛主席的教导，为了正义的事业，不怕牺牲，不畏困难，高举反对美帝国主义、反对佐藤政府、反对苏修和日修的旗帜，为了击败美帝的侵略政策和为了祖国的完全独立而战斗下去，直到取得最后胜利。
    著名历史学者井上清代表山崎母校京都大学的教职员工在葬礼仪式上讲话。他说，山崎的死，激励了日本人民和世界人民反对美帝侵略越南的斗志。我们要踏着山崎的血迹，继承他的遗志，奋勇前进。井上严厉谴责佐藤政府的法西斯罪行和日共宫本修正主义集团对日本人民反美爱国斗争的叛卖。他指出，日修已经堕落成为美日反动派的同谋犯。
    十月八日在羽田机场同山崎一道进行反对佐藤去南越进行阴谋活动的日本学生代表，反对美军扩大空军基地的砂川町居民代表，反对佐藤政府夺田修建机场的三里塚农民代表，日本青年、工人、妇女、宗教界的代表以及日本民族英雄桦美智子的母亲，都在葬礼仪式上讲了话。
