The industrious and brave people of the liberated areas of Laos, while fighting bravely against the American aggressors and their lackeys, are striving to increase agricultural production. After successfully harvesting the early rice, they have launched a new battle for the late rice crop, aiming to achieve a good harvest this year.

According to broadcasts by the Pathet Lao radio station, various levels of leadership in the liberated areas of Laos have strengthened the organization and leadership of agricultural production. The county committee of Mangsay in Vientiane Province has helped farmers consolidate and establish over 100 mutual aid groups. The county committee has also actively encouraged farmers to develop water conservancy projects. In the past few months, farmers in this county have dug over 11 kilometers of irrigation canals, irrigating more than 150 hectares of land. Due to the development of water conservancy, the late rice cultivation area in this county has expanded by nearly 100 hectares. The provinces of Xieng Khouang, Sam Neua, Xam Neua, and Saravane have also completed many irrigation projects, providing irrigation for large areas of farmland.

Currently, in the liberated areas, lush green rice fields stretch as far as the eye can see, and the rice plants are growing well.

Various organs and troops in the liberated areas are carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, launching a wave of self-sufficiency production. They use their spare time and intervals between battles to actively participate in production labor, reclaiming large tracts of wasteland, and planting various grains and vegetables. The organs and troops in Xieng Khouang Province have already produced enough grain to be self-sufficient for two months.

This year, the early rice crop in the liberated areas has been a good harvest. People in various places are enthusiastically paying their grain tax to support the front line.

The people of Mangsay County in Vientiane Province, after completing their grain tax payment, have also sold over 700 tons of surplus grain to the state. The people of Sam Neua, Phong Saly, Xam Neua, and Savannakhet provinces have also sold a large amount of surplus grain to the state.

In many places, people have organized support teams, sending large quantities of grain, meat, and vegetables to the front line to comfort the brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

The people of the liberated areas of Laos are developing production while fighting against American aggression and for national salvation. The picture shows the military and people of the liberated areas of Laos harvesting a bumper crop of rice.

　　一面英勇杀敌　一面努力生产
　　老挝解放区人民力争农业获得好收成
　　各地人民踊跃缴纳公粮或卖余粮支援前线
    新华社康开十二日电  勤劳勇敢的老挝解放区人民，在同美国强盗及其走狗进行英勇战斗的同时，努力增加农业生产，在胜利地收割了早稻之后，又投入了晚造生产的新战斗，力争今年晚稻获得好收成。
    据巴特寮电台广播，老挝解放区各级领导都加强了对农业生产的组织领导。万象省芒塞县县委帮助农民巩固和成立了一百多个互助组。县委还积极鼓励农民兴修水利，在今年的几个月中，这个县的农民就增挖了长达十一公里的水渠，使一百五十多公顷土地得到灌溉。由于水利的发展，这个县的晚稻耕作面积又扩大了近一百公顷。川圹、桑怒、甘蒙等省也建成了许多灌溉工程，使大面积的农田获得了灌溉。
    现在，在解放区里，绿油油的稻田一片连着一片，稻禾长势良好。
    解放区各机关和部队发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗精神，正在掀起一个生产自给的热潮。他们利用业余时间和战斗间隙，积极参加生产劳动，开垦了大量的荒地，种上了杂粮和蔬菜。川圹省各机关和部队所生产的粮食，已可以自给两个月。
    今年，解放区的早稻获得了好收成。各地人民都在踊跃缴纳公粮，支援前线。
    万象省芒塞县人民在完成了缴纳公粮任务之后，还多卖给国家七百多吨余粮。桑怒、丰沙里，甘蒙和沙湾拿吉等省的人民也多卖给国家许多余粮。
    许多地方的人民还组织了支前队，把大批粮食、肉类和蔬菜送到前线，慰劳英勇杀敌的人民解放军。（附图片）
