Revolutionary masses in Huainan resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They widely organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guiding principle for study. They further consolidate and develop the systematic revolutionary great alliance, and coal production continues to rise.

	BEIJING, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- The broad masses of revolutionary workers and revolutionary people in Huainan City, Anhui Province, have earnestly studied and implemented the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, further consolidated and developed the systematic revolutionary great alliance, and promoted the great development of production. Coal production continues to rise.

	Since the Cultural Revolution began, due to the manipulation and instigation of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the revolutionary masses in Huainan City were split into two opposing factions. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two hostile factions," it was like a spring thunder, quickly raising the consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers. The wind of revolutionary great alliance soon swept across the entire city. Under the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary people in Huainan City basically achieved the systematic revolutionary great alliance in just a few days in late September. Now, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, they have placed the study and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. They have launched a magnificent campaign of propaganda and study. The entire city has set up more than 700 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with tens of thousands of revolutionary workers and their families participating in the study. In their studies, they take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guiding principle, seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism, and effectively consolidate and develop the systematic revolutionary great alliance.

	To deepen their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary masses in Huainan City, while organizing the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have focused on class education and carried out the "two remembrances, two discussions" activities, that is, remembering the history of the working class being exploited and oppressed before liberation, and remembering the history of the working class struggling under Chairman Mao's leadership; discussing how the working class can better shoulder the two heavy burdens of "grasp revolution, promote production" given by Chairman Mao, and discussing how to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. Through these activities, the broad revolutionary workers have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. An old miner said painfully: "Before liberation, we workers mined coal together for the capitalists. The capitalist's whip lashing on our comrades was like lashing on ourselves. At that time, our target was unified against the capitalists; after liberation, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we became the masters of the mine, united and struggled for socialist construction; in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, our common target is to overthrow the Khrushchev in China and his agents in Anhui and Huainan. We indeed have no fundamental conflict of interest. Chairman Mao's words truly hit the mark. We must unite and fight the enemy together."

	The great leader Chairman Mao, after the National Day, invited the Prime Minister of Congo (Brazzaville) Numaazale to visit Huainan, which brought great encouragement to the revolutionary masses in Huainan. The broad revolutionary masses said that they must further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, grasp the revolution, and promote production to repay Chairman Mao's great concern for them.

	Now, the broad revolutionary workers in Huainan City all care about the revolutionary great alliance. For the new problems that have emerged after the great alliance, the revolutionary masses, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, take various effective measures to timely handle and correctly solve them. Huainan City has generally established mass supervisory groups, with representatives from the two factions of revolutionary masses and representatives from the People's Liberation Army participating, specifically responsible for handling issues and disputes between mass organizations and workers that are not conducive to the revolutionary great alliance, which has been widely welcomed by the revolutionary masses.

	Because the revolutionary masses in Huainan City resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolutionary situation is getting better and better, and production has also shown a new situation. The workers say: Use Mao Zedong Thought to grasp the revolution, the revolution is invincible; use Mao Zedong Thought to promote production, production develops greatly. At present, the revolutionary miners in the entire city are spirited and full of fighting spirit, and coal production continues to rise. The revolutionary workers of Xiejiaji San Mine are full of boundless love for Chairman Mao, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production. The coal production of the entire mine has increased several times, and the daily production has surged to more than 2,500 tons. Fourteen old miners of Liqingzi Yi Mine voluntarily organized the Red Flag Production Team, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and implement Chairman Mao's instructions in action. They insist on eight hours of underground work and have become the learning example of all workers in the mine. Many miners' families also voluntarily formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, propagandizing above ground and working underground, contributing to grasping the revolution and promoting production. Twenty-four miners' families in Liqingzi Er Mine went underground to participate in auxiliary production, and can help miners produce more than 100 tons of coal every day.

    淮南革命群众坚决执行毛主席最新指示
    普遍举办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲进行学习按照系统的革命大联合进一步巩固发展，煤炭产量不断上升
    新华社合肥二十三日电　安徽淮南市广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真学习和贯彻伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，进一步巩固和发展按系统的革命大联合，促进了生产的大发展，煤炭产量不断上升。
    文化大革命开展以来，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的操纵和挑拨，使淮南市革命群众分成对立的两大派组织。伟大领袖毛主席发出了“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”这一最新指示以后，犹如一声春雷，迅速提高了广大革命职工的觉悟，革命大联合的东风很快吹遍全市。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在中国人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，在九月下旬的短短几天内，就基本上实现了按系统的革命大联合。现在他们又在人民解放军的帮助下，把学习和贯彻毛主席的最新指示放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，开展了轰轰烈烈的大宣传大学习运动。全市办起了七百多个毛泽东思想学习班，有数万革命职工和家属参加了学习。他们在学习中，以“斗私，批修”为纲，认真地开展批评和自我批评，有力地巩固和发展了按系统的革命大联合。
    淮南无产阶级革命派和革命群众为了加深对毛主席的最新指示的领会，在组织学习毛主席的最新指示的同时，狠抓阶级教育，开展“两忆、两谈”活动，即忆解放前工人阶级受剥削，受压迫史，忆工人阶级在毛主席领导下团结斗争史；谈工人阶级如何更好地肩负起毛主席交给的“抓革命，促生产”的两副重担，谈如何读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。通过这些活动，广大革命职工对毛主席的最新指示理解更深了。有的老矿工沉痛地说：“在解放前，我们工人一块儿给资本家挖煤，资本家的鞭子抽在同伴们身上，就象抽在自己身上一样，那时，目标一致对准资本家；解放后，我们在毛主席领导下，做了矿山的主人，团结一致为社会主义建设出力；在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的共同目标，是要打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在安徽和淮南的代理人，我们就是没有根本的利害冲突，毛主席的话真是说到我们的心坎里。我们就是要联合起来，共同对敌。”
    伟大领袖毛主席在国庆节后邀请刚果（布）总理努马扎莱访问淮南，给淮南革命群众带来了极大的鼓舞。广大革命群众说，我们一定要进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合，抓好革命，促好生产，报答毛主席对我们的巨大关怀。
    现在，淮南市的广大革命职工人人都关心革命的大联合。对于大联合以后出现的一些新问题，革命群众按照毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，采取各种有效的措施，及时处理，正确解决。淮南市普遍建立了群众性的监督小组，由两派革命群众组织的代表和人民解放军代表参加，专门负责处理群众组织之间、职工之间不利于革命大联合的问题和纠纷，受到了革命群众的普遍欢迎。
    由于淮南无产阶级革命派和革命群众坚决按毛主席的指示办事，革命的形势越来越好，生产上也出现了新气象。工人们说：用毛泽东思想抓革命，革命无不胜；用毛泽东思想促生产，生产大发展。目前，全市革命矿工精神振奋，斗志昂扬，煤炭产量不断上升。谢家集三矿革命职工满怀对毛主席的无限热爱，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全矿煤产量成倍增长，日产量陡增到二千五百多吨。李郢孜一矿的十四名老矿工，自动组织了红旗生产小组，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的指示落实在行动上，他们坚持八小时井下作业，成为全矿职工的学习榜样。不少矿工家属还自动组成毛泽东思想宣传队，井上宣传，井下劳动，为抓革命、促生产出力。李郢孜二矿有二十四名矿工家属下井参加辅助生产，每天可帮助矿工多生产一百多吨煤。
