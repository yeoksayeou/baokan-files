In factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools in the capital, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being set up everywhere. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres are determined to transform their own thinking through study and to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great line of "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism," a new high tide of the campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is sweeping the capital. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses are determined to "use the weapon of self-criticism and the method of strengthening study to transform ourselves, to meet the needs of the Party and the revolution," and to build new achievements for the people and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is developing in victory.

"The key is to be good at learning." In factories and rural areas in the capital, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. From the municipal and district (county) levels down to the grassroots, all levels are setting them up; revolutionary committees, the frontline command posts for promoting production while carrying out revolution, and revolutionary mass organizations, all are setting them up.

These Mao Zedong Thought study classes generally have the following characteristics: First, they take "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, and use Chairman Mao's series of important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as weapons to summarize the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement, deepening the understanding of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; second, they closely combine with the actual struggle at present, bringing the problems encountered in the great alliance of revolution and the "three-in-one combination" of revolution, and actively applying Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," using Mao Zedong Thought as the "arrow" to shoot at the "target" of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit, promoting the revolutionization of thought; third, they take the People's Liberation Army as an example, under the guidance of the PLA in carrying out the "three supports, two military" tasks, striving to highlight the "four firsts," carry forward the "three-eighths" style, and implement the principle of political leadership and ideological vanguard; fourth, they use the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," mainly through self-criticism, carrying out mass self-education.

The revolutionary workers participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by the industrial, transportation, and urban construction systems regard themselves both as a force for revolution and as an object of revolution. They follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, take up the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, seriously examine the various non-proletarian ideas in their minds, and further promote the revolutionization of thought. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class held at the Beijing Foundry and Forging Company, many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations seriously understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, compare them with their own thoughts, take the lead in self-criticism, examine their petty-bourgeois factionalism and other selfish thoughts, and further correct the erroneous ideas of wanting to "eat up" the other side in the great alliance of revolution. They expressed their determination to bring the gains from their studies back to their units, play a leading role in breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. The first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class in the financial and commercial system of Beijing started on the 9th. Participants include leaders of revolutionary mass organizations and some revolutionary cadres from various bureaus and directly affiliated companies. Commercial, grain, restaurant, service, foreign trade, finance and taxation, supply and marketing, and other municipal financial and commercial organs, as well as financial and commercial units at the district level such as Dongcheng, Chongwen, and Chaoyang, have also successively set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary workers on the financial and commercial front said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like a lighthouse, illuminating our path to victory. We must take Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, take "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, sweep away the "self," and thoroughly expose and criticize the anti-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with Liu Shaoqi as their head, and eliminate their poisonous influence.

The suburban districts of Fengtai, Chaoyang, Pinggu, and Changping have all set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. More than 200 leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in Shunyi County sincerely made self-criticisms in the study class, exposing their selfish thoughts and struggling against selfishness. They said that through study, they have learned how to open up a battlefield to destroy the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat in their minds. Only by liberating themselves from the small world of "self" can they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step. Now, they have returned to their respective posts, leading the masses to deeply study and implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism." Since August this year, the Yucun People's Commune in Daxing County has successively held six sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting the victory of the cultural revolution in the entire commune.

Many colleges, universities, and secondary schools in the capital have also been actively setting up and preparing various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students are actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, deeply touching their souls, launching a battle to break with selfishness and establish public spirit, consolidating and developing the great alliance of revolution and the "three-in-one combination," and concentrating their efforts to complete the glorious historical tasks of revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units.

Soldiers from a certain unit of the garrison in Beijing, who are participating in supporting the left, together with the local proletarian revolutionary cadres, take Chairman Mao's great instruction of "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome various non-proletarian ideas, and fundamentally raise the political consciousness of the proletarian revolutionary cadres.

　　在毛主席的斗私批修伟大方针指引下掀起活学活用毛主席著作运动新高潮
    首都工厂、农村、机关、学校纷纷开办毛泽东思想学习班。广大无产阶级革命派，决心通过学习改造自己的思想，夺取无产阶级文化大革命新胜利
    据新华社十二日讯  在毛主席的“斗私，批修”伟大方针指引下，首都掀起了活学活用毛主席著作群众运动新高潮。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，决心“要用自我批评的武器和加强学习的方法，来改造自己，使适合于党与革命的需要”，在胜利发展的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，为人民建立新的功劳，夺取新的胜利。
    “重要的问题在善于学习”。在首都工厂、农村，毛泽东思想学习班正象雨后春笋般开办起来。从市、区（县）直到基层，各级都办；革命委员会、抓革命促生产第一线指挥部和革命群众组织，各方都办。
    这些毛泽东思想学习班，一般有这样几个特点：一、以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席对无产阶级文化大革命的一系列重要指示为武器，总结前一阶段运动的经验教训，加深对无产阶级文化大革命的理解；二、紧密结合当前斗争的实际，带着在革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”等方面遇到的问题，活学活用毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射资产阶级、小资产阶级之“的”，破私立公，促进人的思想革命化；三、以人民解放军为榜样，在执行“三支”、“两军”任务的解放军的帮助下，努力突出四个第一，大兴三八作风，实行政治挂帅、思想领先的原则；四、运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，主要通过自我批评，进行群众性的自我教育。
    参加工业、交通、城市建设系统举办的毛泽东思想学习班的革命职工，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又把自己当作革命的对象，他们遵循毛主席的伟大教导，拿起批评和自我批评的武器，认真检查自己头脑中的各种非无产阶级思想，进一步促进思想革命化。在北京市铸锻公司举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，许多革命群众组织负责人，认真领会毛主席的最新指示，对照自己的思想实际，带头作自我批评，检查了自己的小资产阶级派性以及其他私心杂念，进一步纠正了想在革命大联合中“吃掉”对方等错误思想。他们表示要把学习中的收获带回本单位，在破私立公中起带头作用，巩固和发展革命大联合，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，搞好本单位的斗批改。北京市财贸系统第一期毛泽东思想学习班九日已经开始，参加学习的包括各局和直属公司革命群众组织的负责人和一部分革命干部。商业、粮食、饭店、服务、对外贸易、财政税收、供销等市级财贸机关，以及东城、崇文、朝阳等区级财贸单位，最近也都相继开办了毛泽东思想学习班。财贸战线上的广大革命职工说，毛主席的最新指示象灯塔，照亮了我们胜利前进的道路。我们一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，横扫“私”字，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒。
    郊区的丰台、朝阳、平谷、昌平等区、县都已纷纷办起毛泽东思想学习班。顺义县二百多名革命群众组织的负责人在学习班中，亮私心，斗“私”字，诚恳地作了自我批评。他们说，经过学习，懂得了怎样在自己头脑里开辟灭资兴无的战场，只有从“私”字的小天地里解放出来，才能步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。现在，他们已经回到各自的岗位，带动群众深入学习和贯彻毛主席“斗私，批修”的指示。大兴县榆垡公社从今年八月以来，连续举办了六期毛主席著作学习班，推动了全公社文化大革命的胜利发展。
    首都许多大专院校和中等学校的革命委员会和革命群众组织，最近也正在积极开办和筹办各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班。广大红卫兵和革命师生，活学活用毛泽东思想，狠触灵魂，开展一场破私立公的战斗，巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，集中力量完成革命的大批判和本单位斗批改的光荣历史任务。（附图片）
