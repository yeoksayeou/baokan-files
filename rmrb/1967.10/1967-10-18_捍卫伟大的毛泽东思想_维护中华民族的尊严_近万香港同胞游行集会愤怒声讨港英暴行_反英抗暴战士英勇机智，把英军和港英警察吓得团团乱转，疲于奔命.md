Nearly ten thousand Hong Kong compatriots have held large-scale demonstrations and street rallies in recent days, firmly supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest note to the British government on the 9th, and angrily denouncing the fascist atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities against our patriotic compatriots since the National Day celebrations.

The flames of anti-British and anti-violence have been burning across Hong Kong and Kowloon in recent days. On the 15th alone, patriotic compatriots held street rallies and marches in 23 areas in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the "New Territories." In the evening, around 7:30 PM, in the bustling Wan Chai district of Kowloon, anti-British and anti-violence protesters bravely hung a large red banner in the middle of the road that read "Avenging the Martyrs." Hundreds of patriotic compatriots immediately gathered from all directions. They formed a grand march, singing "Strive for Victory" and chanting slogans such as "Support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Note," "Protest the British Tearing of Our National Flag," "The British Must Be Defeated, We Must Win," and "Long Live the Invincible Thought of Mao Zedong."

In Tung Tau Village, 1,200 patriotic compatriots held a demonstration and march. The front of the procession carried a red banner that read "Protest the British Fascist Atrocities." The marching crowd chanted "Long Live Chairman Mao" along the way and distributed leaflets. In Oil Street, about 500 patriotic compatriots, despite the nearby Hong Kong British police station, held a mass meeting on the street with great courage. A Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team performed anti-British and anti-violence cultural performances. Nearly a thousand nearby residents cheered for the brave actions of the anti-British and anti-violence fighters. In Tsuen Wan, more than 1,000 patriotic compatriots held a rally in the city center. The chairman of the rally called on compatriots to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further unite, and to organize a grand anti-British and anti-violence army to fiercely counter the provocations of the British fascist authorities. The immense momentum of the anti-British and anti-violence crowd frightened two nearby Hong Kong British policemen, who hurriedly fled into a small shop and dared not come out.

In the afternoon of the 14th, around 1:30 PM, residents of the "tourist area" Tsim Sha Tsui held their first street rally to protest the British fascist atrocities. The crowd gathered in front of a large hotel, continuously raising their arms to chant slogans, singing "Strive for Victory" and "The Great Helmsman Steers the Ship," and distributing a large number of leaflets. After the rally, they held a demonstration and march. At the same time, in the Tai Kok Tsui district, an anti-British and anti-violence cultural troupe performed for the street vendors in the market center. Many nearby residents joined the cultural troupe members in chanting anti-British and anti-violence slogans. After the performance, several hundred workers and students formed a procession and held a demonstration and march.

In recent days, workers from the textile dyeing, gas, telephone, tram, sea and land cargo, milk, assessment, and maritime industries have held rallies. The workers, filled with hatred, angrily denounced the British fascist atrocities against Hong Kong compatriots over the past five months. They said: To uphold the dignity of the Chinese nation and to defend the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, we workers dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. We firmly support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest note and resolutely respond to the call of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Struggle Committee Against British Oppression: Take immediate action and join the battle. If the British do not surrender, we will make them perish!

Patriotic students who have rushed out from schools controlled by the British, Americans, and the KMT in recent days have held joint rallies with the workers to denounce the crimes of the British. Workers and students, through their personal experiences, have bitterly denounced the countless crimes of the British. Many students, with tears in their eyes, exposed the British's evil system of enslavement education. They excitedly said: It is the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought that has opened our eyes, helped us distinguish right from wrong, and clarified our direction. We love the great leader Chairman Mao without limit and are loyal to the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. We must learn the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the Red Guards of our motherland, dare to be bold, and greatly rebel against British imperialism.

Recently, red flags, banners, leaflets, and homemade bombs against the British and violence have appeared everywhere in Hong Kong and the "New Territories." The anti-British and anti-violence fighters, with their bravery and wisdom, have frightened the British army and Hong Kong British police, who are crazily suppressing patriotic compatriots, into a state of panic and exhaustion. The brave actions of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots have made the Hong Kong British authorities feel very frightened and discouraged.

　　捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想　维护中华民族的尊严
　　近万香港同胞游行集会愤怒声讨港英暴行
　　反英抗暴战士英勇机智，把英军和港英警察吓得团团乱转，疲于奔命
    据新华社香港十七日电　近万名香港爱国同胞连日来举行大规模示威游行和街头集会，坚决拥护我国外交部九日给英国政府的抗议照会，愤怒声讨港英当局从我国庆活动以来加紧镇压我爱国同胞的法西斯暴行。
    反英抗暴的怒火这几天在港九遍地燃烧。仅十五日这一天，爱国同胞就在港九和“新界”的二十三个地区举行了街头集会和游行。当晚七时多，在九龙最热闹的旺角区，反英抗暴群众勇敢地在马路中央挂出一幅写着“为烈士报仇”的巨幅红布标语，几百名爱国同胞立即从四面八方汇集拢来。他们组成一支浩浩荡荡的游行大军，高唱着《争取胜利》的歌曲前进，并高呼“拥护我外交部照会”“抗议港英撕毁我国旗”“港英必败，我们必胜”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁”等口号。在东头村，一千二百名爱国同胞举行了示威游行，队伍前面高举着“抗议港英法西斯暴行”的红布横额，游行群众沿途高呼“毛主席万岁”，并散发传单。在油麻地，约五百名爱国同胞蔑视近在咫尺的港英警署，以大无畏的精神在街上举行群众大会。一队毛泽东思想宣传队演出了反英抗暴文艺节目。在旁边观看的近千名街道居民，为反英抗暴战士的英勇行动热烈叫好。在荃湾，一千多名爱国同胞在市区中心举行大会，大会主席号召同胞们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步团结起来，组织起浩浩荡荡的反英抗暴大军，对港英法西斯当局的挑衅进行猛烈的回击。反英抗暴群众的巨大声势，吓得附近的两名港英警察慌忙逃进一家小店里，不敢出来。
    十四日下午一时多，在“旅游区”尖沙嘴的街坊群众第一次在街头举行集会，抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行。群众在一家大酒店前面集会，不断振臂高呼口号，高唱《争取胜利》和《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，并大量散发传单，会后举行了示威游行。与此同时，在大角嘴区，一支反英抗暴文工队在市场中央为小贩们演出，许多围观的街坊群众都跟文工队员们一起高呼反英抗暴口号。演出结束后，几百名工人和学生组成的队伍举行了示威游行。
    连日来，香港纺织染、煤气、电话、电车、海陆理货、牛奶、评务和海事工人等分别举行了集会。工人们怀着满腔仇恨，愤怒声讨港英当局五个多月来迫害香港同胞的法西斯暴行。他们说：为了维护中华民族的尊严，为了捍卫光焰无际的毛泽东思想，我们工人刀山敢上，火海敢闯。我们最坚决地拥护我外交部的抗议照会，坚决响应港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会的号召：立即行动起来，投入战斗。港英不投降，就叫它灭亡！
    从英、美、蒋帮控制的学校里冲杀出来的爱国学生，这几天来同工人主力军一起，联合举行了控诉港英罪行大会。工人和学生用亲身的经历，对港英的累累罪行进行了血泪控诉。许多学生含着眼泪揭露港英万恶的奴化教育制度。他们激动地说：是光焰无际的毛泽东思想使我们擦亮了眼睛，明辨是非，认清方向。我们无限热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们一定要学习祖国红卫兵的革命造反精神，敢字当头，大造港英帝国主义的反。
    最近，港九“新界”各地到处出现反英抗暴红旗、标语、传单和土制炸弹。反英抗暴战士英勇机智，把疯狂镇压爱国同胞的英军、港英警察吓得团团乱转，疲于奔命。香港爱国同胞的英勇行动，使港英当局感到十分恐惧与沮丧。
