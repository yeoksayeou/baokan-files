The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, proposed the brilliant idea of establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities with the countryside. This not only opened the only correct path to victory for the Chinese people, but also pointed out the broad and smooth road to genuine liberation for the proletariat and oppressed people of the entire world. Forty years ago, Chairman Mao ignited the spark on Jinggangshan, and today it has become a raging inferno in many regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Revolutionaries in some Asian, African, and Latin American countries enthusiastically praise the "Jinggangshan Road" as the correct path to revolutionary victory.

	Revolution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America Must Follow the Path of the Chinese Revolution

The heroic people of South Vietnam in their anti-American national salvation war have beaten the American aggressors to a pulp. The military and civilians of South Vietnam have liberated four-fifths of the land and three-quarters of the population in South Vietnam, establishing stable rural revolutionary base areas and forming a favorable situation of surrounding the cities with the countryside. This is a great victory for the people's war. In recalling the fighting experiences of the Burmese people, the first vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, Deqin Badengding, pointed out that the Burmese Communist Party followed Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely taking the path of the Chinese revolution, that is, using the countryside as the base area and guiding the long-term armed struggle with the policy of surrounding the cities with the countryside. They firmly opposed the erroneous proposition of first seizing power in the cities and then developing the countryside, thereby making the Burmese revolution develop in the correct direction. He emphasized, "This is not only an important issue for the Chinese or Burmese revolution, but also a major historical issue related to the revolutionary path of economically backward, agrarian-dominated colonial and semi-colonial, semi-feudal countries." The secretary-general of the Indonesian People's Solidarity Organization, Ibrahim Isa, in a radio speech, said that the Indonesian revolution must achieve complete victory by following the path of the Chinese revolution. He emphasized that apart from completing the establishment of revolutionary base areas in the countryside and transforming the backward countryside into advanced, consolidated base areas, into great revolutionary strongholds in the military, political, economic, and cultural spheres, there is no other way.

The freedom fighters battling on the African continent believe that the rich experience of the Chinese revolution, the path from establishing rural base areas to finally surrounding and seizing the cities, is highly suitable for the revolutionary needs of the African people. Many soldiers of the Congolese (Kin) patriotic armed forces have seriously studied Chairman Mao's theories and strategies of people's war, overcoming the impatience to attack large cities, and establishing the idea of building rural base areas and waging a long-term, protracted war. The organ of the National Liberation Committee of the Congo (Kin), the magazine *Revolution*, in an article titled "Mao Zedong Thought is the Guide for the People of the Congo and the World," pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought not only has great guiding significance for the Chinese people but also for the people of all countries in the world who are waging armed struggles against imperialism and reactionary forces." The article said that after summarizing the experiences and lessons of three years of struggle, "We believe the correct line is to execute the political and strategic teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong on people's war according to the situation and specific conditions of our country." "Any revolutionary who is aware of their responsibility in the struggle cannot ignore this truth. This truth is the absolute guarantee of our final victory."

	Following the Teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong
	Deepening into the Countryside to Wage Armed Struggles

The revolutionary people of Latin America, in order to get rid of the heavy exploitation and brutal oppression of American imperialism and old and new colonialism, are fighting for freedom and liberation by taking up arms. Party organizations, mass organizations, and progressive friends in some countries have made resolutions or issued statements, emphasizing the need to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, deepen into the countryside to wage armed struggles, establish rural base areas, and surround the cities with the countryside to ultimately achieve victory. The Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) of Colombia and the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile, among others, have emphasized in their resolutions that "the defeat suffered by the Dominican urban uprising has clearly proven that, under the current conditions of our continent, the countryside is the inevitable arena for the people's war." "The armed people's war will be led by the party of the proletariat, and the people's war to seize power will be a long-term armed struggle, with the countryside as its main stage." "The people will develop their strength in the struggle, and this strength will be placed in the enemy's weak points—the countryside, where the enemy's contradictions with the people cannot be maintained." A Latin American friend, while visiting the cradle of the Chinese revolution—Jinggangshan, excitedly said, "Wonderful! Chairman Mao's thoughts are wonderful! His theories of people's war, land revolution, seizing power with the gun, and establishing rural base areas are also completely applicable to us. The land in our country is even more concentrated than during your great revolution, with 90% owned by landlords and 70% of the farmers owning nothing. Their suffering is indescribable, and class hatred is particularly deep..." An old revolutionary comrade from Brazil, after visiting Jinggangshan, was particularly excited and said, "In order to find a path to liberation for Brazil, I have been searching for decades. Today, I have found it in China; this is the Jinggangshan Road!" A leader of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization emphasized that the path from the countryside to the cities, found through the experience of Comrade Mao Zedong leading the Chinese revolution for 22 years of armed struggle, "is a great contribution to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." The people of Latin America will implement this Marxist line, summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong after the Chinese revolution, according to their own conditions.

	Only by Mobilizing and Relying on the Masses
	Can the Revolutionary War Achieve Victory

To establish rural base areas, one must go deep into the countryside, rely on the peasants, and mobilize the peasants. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can one wage war, and only by relying on the masses can one wage war." A soldier from the original Second Battalion of the Lao People's Liberation Army, in recalling the growth process of the unit, pointed out that Chairman Mao's teaching that "revolutionary war is the war of the masses" is an unshakable truth. He said that in 1957, when various forces in Laos first united, the enemy wanted the Second Battalion to advance to the Char Plain, which had no mass base, intending to take the opportunity to annihilate it. The enemy secretly distributed weapons, ammunition, and poison to the local people around the station to be used against the Second Battalion. However, because the cadres and soldiers of the Second Battalion, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that the people's army must strengthen political work among the masses, actively propagated and educated the masses in the local area, the enemy's weapons and poison did not harm a single hair of the people's army, and the masses instead supported the people's army. The Angolan guerrilla fighters battling in the African jungles also enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao's teaching that "the army must blend with the people." They said that without the support and help of the local people, the guerrilla forces could not survive and fight. The surrounding masses not only frequently sent intelligence and guides to the guerrilla forces but also continuously supplied water, bananas, and cassava. When the enemy came to search, they also did their best to cover and rescue them. Now, more and more local residents are voluntarily joining the guerrilla forces and taking up arms to fight the enemy.

The Political Committee of the Western Front of the Congolese (Kin) patriotic armed forces, based on Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, clearly pointed out in the summary of three years of armed struggle that the Congolese (Kin) patriotic armed forces must first learn from the past struggles and experiences that they must fully mobilize and organize the people. "Only by mobilizing and organizing the people can we change the balance of power between the enemy and us. We must regard the mobilization and organization of the people's strength as the fundamental guarantee of our victory." The organ of the Congolese (Kin) Revolutionary Youth League, the magazine *Lightning*, emphasized that the urgent task is to master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It said in an article, "The revolutionary experience of the people of various countries in the world proves that the people of a country, no matter how small the country is, as long as the people are politically and ideologically mobilized, organized, and trained, and under the guidance of the correct line, they will definitely be able to resist and defeat any seemingly powerful enemy."

	Using Mao Zedong Thought as a Weapon
	Ultimately Destroying Imperialism

The great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant idea of establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities with the countryside has made a great contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Many revolutionaries in various countries enthusiastically praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. A Burmese friend, Wu Miaozhi, said well, "Chairman Mao's theory of people's war provides an invincible and limitless power to the revolutionary people of the world, especially the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The people will use this weapon to ultimately destroy the bloody rule of imperialism and reactionaries. When the people wage a just people's war in the vast 'rural areas' of the world—Asia, Africa, and Latin America—these areas will become thousands of erupting volcanoes, burying imperialism and reactionaries in the flames!" A Sudanese friend named Ibrahim, in his enthusiastic poem *The Bright Sun* praising Chairman Mao, wrote:

	"The great thought of Comrade Mao Zedong,
	Like the bright sun illuminating the universe.
	The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought,
	Illuminates every place under colonial rule.
	Mao Zedong Thought awakens the people of various countries,
	To make revolution, to fight the strong....
	Our leader!
	Your theory,
	Belongs to the workers and peasants.
	Your theory,
	The entire universe praises.
	We surround the enemy from the countryside.
	We slaughter the enemy with bayonets,
	Victory will surely belong to the working people!"

	Editor's Note: Chairman Mao pointed out: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

	Fifty years ago, the proletariat of Russia, under the leadership of Lenin, used violent revolution to overthrow the reactionary regime and created the world's first socialist country. At that time, imperialism hated the Soviet Union so much that they gnashed their teeth. The United States, Britain, Japan, and 11 other countries launched armed intervention, intending to strangle the newborn Soviet regime in its cradle. However, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people not only defeated the seemingly powerful enemy's attack but also, amidst the enemy's curses, established a socialist country. At that time, revolutionary people around the world, with boundless respect, looked up at the red star on the Kremlin, cheering: The Soviet Union is our example!

	After Stalin's death, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique usurped the victory fruits of the Soviet people's revolution, leading the country onto the path of comprehensive capitalist restoration. At this time, the imperialists and reactionaries of the United States, Britain, Japan, and others, with smiles on their faces, cheered for the Soviet revisionist clique's misdeeds. The red star on the Kremlin was extinguished. The Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world angrily pointed out that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique had betrayed the October Revolution, betrayed Lenin, and they are great traitors to the proletariat!

	As the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, the Soviet people deeply miss the era led by Lenin and Stalin. The Soviet people, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, will never tolerate the Soviet revisionist traitors riding on their heads for long! They will surely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionists and make the Soviet Union return to the broad and smooth road of socialism.

    井冈山道路是被压迫人民求解放的胜利之路
    世界革命人民热烈赞扬毛主席的农村包围城市等光辉思想对世界革命具有伟大意义
    新华社讯世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席关于建立农村根据地，用乡村包围城市的光辉思想，不仅为中国人民开辟了夺取全国胜利的唯一正确的道路，而且为全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民指出了争取真正解放的康庄大道。四十年前，毛主席在井冈山点燃起了星星之火，今天已经在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲很多地区形成熊熊的烈火。亚非拉一些国家的革命者热烈赞扬“井冈山的道路”是取得革命胜利的正确道路。
        亚非拉革命要取得胜利
            必须走中国革命的道路
    英雄的越南南方人民的抗美救国战争，把美国侵略者打得落花流水。南越军民已经解放了南越五分之四的土地和四分之三的人口，建立了稳固的农村革命根据地，形成了农村包围城市的有利局面。这是人民战争思想的伟大胜利。缅共中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶在回顾缅甸人民的战斗经历时指出，缅甸共产党遵循毛主席的教导，坚决走中国革命的道路，即以农村为根据地，在农村包围城市的方针指导下，进行长期武装斗争，坚决反对先在城市里夺取政权，然后再向农村发展的错误主张，因而使缅甸革命朝着正确的方向发展。他强调指出，“这不仅是中国或缅甸革命的重要问题，而且关系到经济落后的、农业经济占统治地位的殖民地和半殖民地、半封建国家的革命道路，是具有历史意义的重大问题。”印尼亚非人民团结组织秘书长易卜拉欣·伊萨在一篇广播讲话中说，印尼革命要取得完全的胜利，必须走中国革命的道路。他强调指出，除了完成在农村建立革命根据地，把落后的农村变成先进的、巩固的根据地，变成军事上、政治上、经济上和文化上的伟大革命阵地外，别无它路。
    战斗在非洲大陆的自由战士认为，中国革命胜利的丰富经验，中国从建立农村根据地到最后包围和夺取城市的道路，非常适应非洲人民的革命需要。刚果（金）爱国武装力量许多战士认真学习了毛主席关于人民战争的理论和战略战术，克服急于攻打大城市的急躁情绪，树立了建设农村根据地和进行长期的持久战的思想。刚果（金）全国解放委员会机关刊物《革命》在一篇题为《毛泽东思想是刚果和全世界革命人民的指南》的文章中指出：“毛泽东思想不仅对中国人民，而且对正在进行反对帝国主义和反动势力的武装斗争的世界各国人民都具有伟大的指导意义。”文章说，刚果（金）爱国武装力量在总结了三年斗争的经验教训之后，“我们认为正确的路线是根据我国的形势和具体条件去执行毛泽东同志关于人民战争的政治上和战略上的教导”。“任何意识到了自己的斗争责任的革命者都不能不重视这个真理。这个真理是我们取得最后胜利的绝对保证。”
        遵循毛泽东同志的教导
            深入农村开展武装斗争
    拉丁美洲革命人民为了摆脱美帝国主义和新老殖民主义的沉重剥削和残酷压迫，争自由，求解放，已经拿起武器进行斗争。一些国家的政党组织、群众团体和进步朋友纷纷作出决议或发表声明，强调要遵循毛主席的教导，深入农村开展武装斗争，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取胜利。哥伦比亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）和智利革命共产党等都分别在决议中强调指出，“多米尼加城市起义所遭受的打击，加倍清楚地证明了在我们大陆目前的条件下，农村是人民战争的必然场所”，“武装的人民战争将由无产阶级的党进行坚定的领导，而夺取政权的人民战争将是一场长期的武装斗争，它的基本舞台将是农村”，“人民将在战斗中发展自己的力量，这力量将摆在敌人薄弱的地点——农村，摆在敌人同人民群众的矛盾无法维持下去的地方”。一位拉丁美洲朋友在参观中国革命摇篮——井冈山时激动地说，“太好了！毛主席的思想太好了！他的人民战争、土地革命、枪杆子夺取政权、建立农村根据地的理论，也完全适合于我们。我们国家的土地比你们大革命时期的土地还要集中，百分之九十归庄园主，百分之七十以上的农民一无所有。他们的痛苦无法形容，阶级仇恨也特别深……。”一位巴西的老革命同志在访问井冈山后特别兴奋地说，“为了寻找一条巴西解放的道路，我找了几十年。今天，我在中国找到了，这就是井冈山的道路！”阿根廷共产主义先锋组织的一位领导人强调指出，毛泽东同志领导中国革命进行二十二年武装斗争经验所找出的从农村到城市的道路，“是对亚非拉各国人民的一个伟大贡献”。拉丁美洲人民将按照自己的条件来贯彻毛泽东同志总结中国革命经验后提出的这条马克思主义路线。
        只有动员群众、依靠群众
            革命战争才能取得胜利
    要建立农村根据地，就要深入农村，依靠农民，发动农民。毛主席指出：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”老挝人民解放军原老二营的一位战士在回顾部队成长的过程时指出，毛主席关于“革命战争是群众的战争”的教导是颠扑不破的真理。他说，一九五七年老挝各种力量第一次联合时，敌人要老二营进驻到没有群众基础的查尔平原去，企图伺机加以消灭。敌人把枪支弹药和毒药秘密发给驻地周围的老百姓，用以对付老二营。但是由于老二营的干部和战士根据毛主席关于人民军队必须加强对群众进行政治工作的教导，在当地积极地宣传群众和教育群众。结果，敌人的武器和毒药不但无损于人民军队的一根毫毛，群众反而支持人民军队。战斗在非洲丛林中的安哥拉游击队员也热烈称颂毛主席关于“军队须和民众打成一片”的教导。他们说，如果没有当地人民的支持和帮助，游击队是无法生存和战斗的。周围群众不仅经常给游击队送情报、做向导，而且还源源不断地送来饮水、香蕉和木薯。当敌人前来搜查时，他们又千方百计掩护和营救。如今已有越来越多的当地居民志愿参加游击队，拿起武器同敌人作战。
    刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会根据毛主席的光辉思想，在关于三年武装斗争的总结中明确指出，刚果（金）爱国武装力量从过去的斗争中首先要吸取经验教训的是必须充分地发动人民和组织人民。“只有把人民发动和组织起来，才能改变敌我力量的对比。我们必须把发动和组织人民的力量看作是我们取得胜利的根本保证。”刚果（金）革命青年联盟机关刊物《闪电》杂志强调当务之急是要把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想掌握起来。它在一篇文章中说，“世界各国人民的革命经验证明，一个国家的人民，不管这个国家多么小，只要人民在政治上和思想上动员起来、组织起来和受到训练，并在正确的路线指引下，那么一定能够抗击和战胜任何貌似强大的敌人。”
        用毛泽东思想作武器
              最后摧毁帝国主义
    伟大领袖毛主席关于建立农村根据地，用乡村包围城市的光辉思想，为世界人民的革命斗争作出了伟大贡献。许多国家的革命者热情赞扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想。缅甸朋友吴苗漆说得好，“毛主席关于人民战争的理论向全世界革命人民、特别是亚非拉革命人民提供了不可战胜的威力无限的武器。人民将用这一武器最后摧毁帝国主义和反动派的血腥统治势力。当人民在广大的世界‘农村地区’，——亚非拉三大洲——进行正义的人民战争时，这些地区将成为成千上万座爆发的火山，把帝国主义和反动派埋葬在烈火中！”
    非洲苏丹一位叫易卜拉欣的朋友在他热情歌颂毛主席的诗篇《光辉的太阳》中写道：
      “毛泽东同志的伟大思想，
    象光辉的太阳照亮了宇宙。
    毛泽东思想的光辉，
    照亮殖民者统治下的每个地方。
    毛泽东思想唤起各国人民，
    闹革命，斗豪强。……
    我们的领袖啊！
    您的理论，
    属于工人、农民。
    您的理论，
    整个宇宙都在赞扬。
    我们从农村包围敌人。
    我们用刺刀杀戮敌人，
    胜利一定属于劳动人民！”
    编者按：毛主席指出：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
    五十年前，俄国的无产阶级在列宁的领导下，用暴力革命推翻了反动政权，创建了世界上第一个社会主义国家。当时，帝国主义对苏联恨得咬牙切齿，美、英、日等十四个国家发动了武装干涉，想把新生的苏维埃政权扼杀在摇篮中。但是，在列宁、斯大林的领导下，苏联人民不但击败了貌似强大的敌人的进攻，而且在敌人的咒骂声中建立了社会主义国家。那时，全世界革命人民怀着无限崇敬的心情，仰望着克里姆林宫上的红星，欢呼：苏联是我们的榜样！
    斯大林逝世以后，苏修统治集团窃取了苏联人民革命的胜利果实，把国家引上了资本主义全面复辟的邪路。这时，美、英、日等帝国主义和反动派，对苏修集团的倒行逆施，满脸堆笑，连声喝采。苏联修正主义统治集团同帝国主义和反动派握手言欢，亲密无间。克里姆林宫上的红星熄灭了。苏联人民和世界革命人民愤怒地指出，苏修统治集团背叛了十月革命，背叛了列宁，他们是无产阶级的大叛徒！
    十月革命五十周年即将到来，苏联人民无比怀念列宁、斯大林领导的时代。具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民，决不会容忍苏修叛徒长久骑在他们的头上作威作福！他们必将起来造苏修的反，使苏联重新走上社会主义的康庄大道。
