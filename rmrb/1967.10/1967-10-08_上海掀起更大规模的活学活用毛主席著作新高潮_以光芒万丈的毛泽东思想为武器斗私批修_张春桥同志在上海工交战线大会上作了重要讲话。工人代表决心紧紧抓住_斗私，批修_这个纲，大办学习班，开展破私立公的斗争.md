Shanghai has launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works on a larger scale. With the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, the city is carrying out the struggle to criticize and repudiate revisionism and to fight against selfishness. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao made an important speech at a meeting of the Shanghai industrial and transportation front. Worker representatives have resolved to firmly grasp the key of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," to hold extensive study classes, and to wage a struggle to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, SHANGHAI, October 7 — In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's recent directive to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" has risen in Shanghai. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have earnestly studied the extremely important speech made by our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in the capital. They unanimously hold that "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is the fundamental policy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the program of action for the revolutionary masses and the people. They have expressed their determination to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest directive, to use the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to wage a struggle against the "self" in their minds, and to wage a struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, in order to win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee has issued a "Notice on Resolutely Carrying Out Chairman Mao's Latest Directive." The notice stresses that the important thing is to be good at studying. In the current high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a fighting style of study should be advocated, actual conditions should be linked with, and work and production should be promoted. The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai have responded enthusiastically, saying that they will do what they say, and will regard the earnest study of Chairman Mao's latest directive as the most important task at present, determined to make Chairman Mao's latest directive bloom and bear fruit throughout Shanghai.

	On October 6, the revolutionary masses of the Shanghai industrial and transportation front held a grand rally to enthusiastically respond to and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest battle cry, immediately launching a new high tide of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." The leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Comrades Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, other members of the Revolutionary Committee, and the responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army's three services stationed in Shanghai attended the meeting.

	Comrade Zhang Chunqiao made an important speech at the meeting on the situation and tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai.

	Comrade Wang Hongwen, a responsible comrade of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, said in his speech that the Shanghai proletariat most enthusiastically responds to and supports Chairman Mao's latest battle order, resolutely carries it out, and resolutely implements it. He said that firmly grasping the key of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is to grasp the most fundamental key of the cultural revolution. Whether one dares to open fire on the "self" in one's mind and whether one dares to revolutionize oneself is a severe test of whether a proletarian revolutionary is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We should win victories in overcoming selfishness and establishing public spirit, and only then can we achieve new merits in the struggle to criticize revisionism. Wang Hongwen said that in the struggle to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the most powerful weapon is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We should further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and extensively and specially establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We should hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The responsible comrades of all levels of revolutionary organizations should personally grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works. The leaders should first study well and set an example.

	The representative of the Shanghai "Workers' General Headquarters" Chemical System Liaison Station, one of the earliest to hold Chairman Mao's works study classes in the Shanghai industrial and transportation front, said at the meeting that the chemical system had previously held nine sessions of Chairman Mao's works study classes, which had played a great role in promoting the extensive study, extensive criticism, and revolutionary great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" in the chemical system. Starting from today, our tenth session of study classes has begun, and the content of this session is "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." We are determined to promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage and to launch a new situation of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism."

	Since June of this year, the Shanghai Third Steel Plant has held Chairman Mao's works study classes in ten workshops and more than 180 large criticism columns. To ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," the representative of the revolutionary committee of the plant proposed four guarantee measures at the meeting: First, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and to immediately launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the plant. Continue to hold Chairman Mao's works study classes well. Second, to further extensively and deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, and in conjunction with the plant's struggle, criticism, and reform, to thoroughly criticize and denounce the revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by Khrushchev of China, and to truly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Third, the leading group should be revolutionized. The members of the revolutionary committee must consciously put themselves under the supervision of the masses, go deep among the masses, participate in labor, be both an official and a common person, and maintain the revolutionary character of the proletariat. Fourth, to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to insist on making revolution in one's spare time, to make revolution by saving, and to launch a high tide of industrial production.

	Comrade Ma Tiancui, a member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting on the issue of grasping revolution and promoting production. He said that the Shanghai proletariat deeply understands that doing a good job in Shanghai's industrial production is a great support to the proletarian revolutionaries throughout the country and a great contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country. Many workers in various factories insist on making revolution in their spare time and have achieved extremely outstanding results in grasping revolution and promoting production.

	Ma Tiancui pointed out that the proletarian revolutionaries of the Shanghai industrial and transportation front must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, welcome the production high tide of the fourth quarter, and complete the production tasks of the fourth quarter of this year even more outstandingly. He said that to launch a new production high tide in the fourth quarter, the key to the key is to further carry out a great study movement with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. He hoped that the broad proletarian revolutionaries of the industrial and transportation front would emphasize politics, put revolution in the first place, grasp revolution, and promote production. According to the needs of production, complete the plan, but do not pursue production value one-sidedly. While striving to increase production, ensure quality, reduce the consumption of raw materials, save labor, greatly improve labor productivity, save expenses, and increase income. To carry forward the communist style, insist on self-reliance.

	In recent days, the atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's latest directive in many grassroots units in Shanghai has been extremely enthusiastic. The broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses have held discussions and exchanged learning experiences. Some units have also held meetings to make specific arrangements for carrying out Chairman Mao's great directive of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." Some members of the revolutionary committees or responsible comrades of revolutionary mass organizations have considered during the National Day holiday how to further carry out the revolutionary great criticism and prepare to take the lead in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. The broad cadres and soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai have enthusiastically welcomed our great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive, extensively and deeply carried out the study, and expressed their determination to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the program of action, to wage a struggle to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit with a spirit of seeing red with bayonets, to carry out a sharp and vigorous criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and to achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    以光芒万丈的毛泽东思想为武器斗私批修
    张春桥同志在上海工交战线大会上作了重要讲话。工人代表决心紧紧抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，大办学习班，开展破私立公的斗争
    新华社上海七日电　在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，一个更大规模的活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻执行毛主席最近发出的要斗私，批修的伟大指示的群众运动新高潮，已在上海兴起。广大工农兵、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，认真学习了我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席在首都庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年大会上极为重要的讲话。他们一致认为：“斗私，批修”，是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针，是无产阶级革命派和革命人民的行动纲领。他们表示一定坚决执行毛主席的这一最新指示，以光芒万丈的毛泽东思想为武器，同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底胜利。
    上海市革命委员会发出了《关于坚决贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的通知》。通知强调指出，重要的问题在善于学习。在当前活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮中，要提倡战斗的学风，要联系实际，要推动工作和生产。上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众闻风而动，说干就干，把认真学好毛主席的最新指示作为当前的头等重要大事，决心让毛主席的最新指示在全上海开花结果。
    上海工业交通战线无产阶级革命派六日举行了盛大集会，最热烈地响应、最坚决地贯彻毛主席发出的最新战斗号召，立即掀起“斗私，批修”的新高潮。上海市革命委员会负责人张春桥、姚文元同志，市革命委员会其他领导成员和中国人民解放军驻沪三军负责人，出席了大会。
    张春桥同志在大会上就上海无产阶级文化大革命的形势和任务作了重要讲话。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部负责人王洪文同志在会上发言说，我们上海工人阶级最最热烈地响应和拥护毛主席的最新战斗号令，坚决执行，坚决照办。他说，紧紧抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，就是抓住了文化大革命的最根本的关键。敢不敢向自己头脑里的“私”字开火，敢不敢革自己的命，这是我们无产阶级革命派忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的严峻考验。我们应当在破私立公中打胜仗，才能更好地在批修斗争中立新功。王洪文说，在“斗私，批修”中，最有力的武器，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们要进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，我们要大办毛泽东思想学习班。各级革命组织的负责人要亲自抓毛主席著作学习。头头首先要学好，树立榜样。
    上海工业交通战线上最早举办毛主席著作学习班之一的上海“工总司”化工系统联络总站代表，在大会上说，我们化工系统过去办了九期毛主席著作学习班，对化工系统的大学习、大批判和革命的大联合、“三结合”起了很大的推动作用。从今天开始，我们的第十期学习班又开学了，这一期的学习内容就是“斗私，批修”。我们决心把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段，开展“斗私，批修”的新局面。
    上海第三钢铁厂从今年六月开始，已经先后有十个车间举办了毛主席著作学习班和一百八十多处大批判专栏。为了确保毛主席“斗私，批修”伟大方针的贯彻，这个厂的革命委员会代表在大会发言中提出四条保证措施：第一，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，立即在全厂掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。继续办好毛主席著作学习班。第二，进一步广泛深入地开展革命的大批判，并结合本厂的斗批改，把中国赫鲁晓夫的一套修正主义办企业路线彻底批倒批臭，真正确立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。第三，领导班子要革命化。革命委员会的成员，必须自觉地把自己放在群众的监督之下，深入群众，参加劳动，既当“官”，又当老百姓，保持无产阶级的革命本色。第四，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持业余闹革命，节约闹革命，掀起工业生产的高潮。
    上海市革命委员会领导成员马天水同志，在大会上就抓革命、促生产问题讲了话。他说，上海工人阶级深深懂得，把上海的工业生产搞好，是对全国无产阶级革命派的巨大支持，是对全国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大贡献。许多工厂的革命职工坚持业余闹革命，在抓革命、促生产方面，作出了极其出色的成绩。
    马天水指出，上海工业交通战线的无产阶级革命派必须继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迎接第四季度的生产高潮，更出色地完成今年第四季度的生产任务。他说，要掀起第四季度的生产新高潮，关键的关键，在于进一步开展一个以“斗私，批修”为纲的大学习运动，活学活用毛主席著作。他希望工业交通战线上的广大无产阶级革命派，突出政治，把革命放在首位，狠抓革命，猛促生产。要根据需要生产，要完成计划，但不能片面追求产值。要在努力增产的同时，保证质量，降低原料材料消耗，节约使用劳动力，大力提高劳动生产率，节约开支，增加收入。要发扬共产主义风格，坚持自力更生。
    最近几天来，上海许多基层单位学习毛主席最新指示的气氛极为热烈。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众纷纷举行座谈，交流学习体会。有些单位还召开大会，就贯彻执行毛主席“斗私，批修”伟大指示作了具体部署。有些单位的革命委员会成员或革命群众组织负责人，在国庆假期中考虑了如何进一步开展革命大批判，准备带头斗私，批修。驻沪三军部队广大指战员热烈欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，广泛深入地开展了学习。他们表示要以“斗私，批修”为行动纲领，以刺刀见红的精神展开破私立公的斗争，尖锐泼辣地开展对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
