Following Chairman Mao's "three-in-one combination" directive, Beijing's Shijingshan Middle School, which achieved school-wide revolutionary unity by class in April, recently summarized its experience, pointing out that achieving revolutionary unity by class is the necessary path for schools to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is the correct path to achieving a thorough victory in the school's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

With the help of soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Railway Corps who were carrying out military training, the school achieved school-wide revolutionary unity by class in early April. Subsequently, it achieved a revolutionary three-in-one combination, established a temporary power organ, and began the process of resuming classes and making revolution. Over the past half year, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students have had unwavering faith in Chairman Mao's "three-in-one combination" directive. Regardless of storms and waves, they have steadfastly followed the course charted by Chairman Mao, advancing steadily and solidly at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing's middle schools.

Three major battles were fought to achieve revolutionary unity based on teaching classes.

Shijingshan Middle School is a junior middle school with over a thousand teachers and students. When the soldiers first entered the school, there were many mass organizations within the school, each operating independently, and some were even engaged in "internal strife." The soldiers, following Chairman Mao's "three-in-one combination" directive and drawing on the experience of Tianjin Yanan Middle School's military and political training, initially focused on three tasks:

First, they launched a "people's war" to deliver a crushing blow to the bourgeois reactionary line, establishing Chairman Mao's class analysis perspective among revolutionary teachers and students, and helping them distinguish between enemies and friends.

The soldiers first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," combining this with the school's class struggle situation to distinguish between two types of different problems. This helped everyone identify the main enemy as the top capitalist-roader in the Party. This approach educated and united the masses who had been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, laying a solid ideological foundation for achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes.

Second, they carried out rectification, launching a fierce struggle against selfishness, breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism, and establishing proletarian party spirit, returning to the classes to make revolution.

The school had twenty-seven mass organizations that crossed classes and teaching research groups. Their general direction was correct, but to varying degrees, they had errors of localism, cliquism, and anarchism. The soldiers guided everyone to use the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts in the Party" as weapons, using the method of unity-criticism-unity-self-criticism-unity to launch a mass rectification movement. This helped everyone recognize that these erroneous tendencies were due to selfishness. Through self-criticism, the various revolutionary mass organizations united on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought, unifying the Red Guards organization by class, grade, and school system. Red Guard youths returned to their classes to make revolution.

Third, they strictly distinguished between two types of different contradictions, daring to liberate and use cadres, liberating teachers, organizing by teaching groups, paving the way for the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and preparing organizationally for resuming classes and making revolution.

The soldiers first encouraged cadres and teachers who had made mistakes to dare to go to the classes to contact the masses, studying Chairman Mao's works together with the students and jointly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. This gradually eliminated the serious opposition between cadres, teachers, and students caused by the bourgeois reactionary line, helping them establish revolutionary feelings. Then, they mobilized the masses to fully expose and criticize the mistakes and problems of the cadres, conducting a comprehensive class analysis, distinguishing between two types of different contradictions, and clarifying the boundaries between revolution and counter-revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, and revolutionary leading cadres and capitalist-roaders in power. The cadres who had made mistakes also sincerely conducted self-criticism. After the cadres came forward, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students warmly welcomed them to return to work. Three out of the seven leading cadres participated in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, and three were assigned appropriate work. For another cadre who had made serious mistakes, following the principle of "punishing past errors to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," he was allowed to work while checking and criticizing himself. This thoroughly smashed the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small clique" regarding cadre issues, tempering the cadres and educating the masses, and consolidating the class-based revolutionary unity ideologically and organizationally.

In the tide of revolutionary unity, four revolutionary teacher mass organizations that crossed teaching research groups also, on the basis of revolutionary principles, organized by administrative group and professional division, prepared organizationally for resuming classes and making revolution.

Consolidating and developing class-based revolutionary unity amidst storms and waves.

Chairman Mao taught, "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns. In socialist construction, to expect no twists and turns, no tremendous efforts, to be all plain sailing, and to achieve success with ease is merely wishful thinking." Shijingshan Middle School's achievement of revolutionary unity by class was immediately followed by a severe impact from the anarchist trend in society. A small number of teachers and students thought that the school's class-based revolutionary unity was a "hodgepodge," withdrew, and established their own factions, linking up with organizations from outside the school to repeatedly disrupt the revolutionary unity and interfere with the resumption of classes and making revolution. The soldiers led the revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "three-in-one combination" directive, repeatedly study the experience of Yanan Middle School achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes, and repeatedly examine their own path of achieving revolutionary unity by class. They firmly believed that Shijingshan Middle School's achievement of revolutionary unity by class was in line with Mao Zedong Thought and followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unanimously expressing their resolve not to waver. At this time, student parents, workers, and poor and lower-middle peasants actively supported the school's class-based revolutionary unity, encouraging revolutionary teachers and students to bravely and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's "three-in-one combination" directive. With the help of the soldiers, every time they faced a disruption, the revolutionary teachers and students consciously conducted self-education on following Chairman Mao's words and achieving revolutionary unity by class; at the same time, they seriously identified weak links, conducted self-criticism, improved their work, and continuously strengthened the revolutionary unity. Each disruption made the class-based revolutionary unity more consolidated organizationally and ideologically.

On the other hand, the soldiers who were responsible for military training, together with the revolutionary teachers and students, studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," correcting their attitude towards the small number of teachers and students who had withdrawn from the revolutionary unity. Through home visits, individual talks, soliciting opinions, and conducting self-criticism, they carried out patient and meticulous political and ideological work on them, achieving the goal of welcoming them back early or late, and continuing to work patiently on those who had not yet returned. Now, more than twenty teachers and students who had withdrawn from the revolutionary unity have all returned. The school held a welcome meeting to welcome them back to their classes to resume classes and make revolution.

Achieving revolutionary unity by class sparked a high tide of intensive study, extensive criticism, and resuming classes and making revolution.

After achieving revolutionary unity by class and establishing a revolutionary three-in-one combination, Shijingshan Middle School, through more than half a year of practice, fully demonstrated its superiority.

The first manifestation of the superiority of achieving revolutionary unity by class is the broadest mobilization of the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Before achieving class-based revolutionary unity, due to the fragmentation caused by small factions, it was often difficult to organize school-wide mass study of Chairman Mao's works. Some mass organizations studying Chairman Mao's works sometimes, due to factionalism, only criticized others' problems without using it to solve their own ideological issues. After achieving unity by class, the broadest mobilization and organization of the masses were achieved, quickly launching a new high tide of intensive study and application of Chairman Mao's works throughout the school. From the school to the classes and individuals, everyone put studying Chairman Mao's works in the first place, maintaining an unshakable one-hour daily study session. The school organized 115 study groups of Chairman Mao's works, with the majority of teachers and students and many parents participating, greatly promoting the ideological revolution of revolutionary teachers and students.

The second manifestation of the superiority of achieving revolutionary unity by class is the powerful launch of revolutionary criticism. Previously, revolutionary criticism was carried out separately by various mass organizations, only able to engage in small, scattered battles; coupled with factional struggles between organizations, it often shifted the revolutionary direction and weakened the struggle against the enemy. After achieving revolutionary unity by class, from the school to the classes, the largest fighting units were formed, unifying thoughts, steps, and targets, concentrating firepower to launch a revolutionary criticism that was both spectacular and in-depth, and combining it with the situation in their own units to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The third manifestation of the superiority of achieving revolutionary unity by class is that students returned to their classes, teachers were organized by groups, revolutionary cadres were liberated, and it was conducive to resuming classes and making revolution. Since April, when revolutionary unity by class was achieved, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students have followed Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, daring to practice and innovate, consistently maintaining the system of teaching while criticizing and reforming. The time for guiding classes on Chairman Mao's works accounted for 30%, criticism classes for 40%, and cultural knowledge classes such as mathematics, physics, foreign languages, music, and physical education for 30%. In teaching, teachers taught, and students also taught, learning from each other, jointly improving and raising their standards.

The fourth manifestation of the superiority of achieving revolutionary unity by class is the strengthening of the school's revolutionary new order, overcoming the state of anarchy. Revolutionary teachers and students acting in unity by class helped overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhancing revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline.

The activities of intensive study and application of Chairman Mao's works, launching revolutionary criticism, resuming classes and making revolution, and strengthening the revolutionary new order, in turn, consolidated and developed the class-based revolutionary unity, making the class-based revolutionary unity play more of its superiority, ensuring that the school's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement advanced smoothly along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

　　沿着毛主席指引的航向前进就是胜利
　　石景山中学总结了按班级实现全校革命大联合的经验
    遵照毛主席的“三七”指示，四月份按照班级实现了全校革命大联合的北京市石景山中学，最近在总结经验时指出：按班级实现革命大联合，是学校进行无产阶级文化大革命必由之路，是夺取学校无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的正确道路。
    这个学校在人民解放军铁道兵某部执行军训任务的指战员帮助下，四月初按班级实现了全校的革命大联合，接着又实现了革命三结合，建立了临时权力机构，开始了复课闹革命。半年来，广大革命师生对毛主席的“三七”指示无比坚信，不管风吹浪打，始终沿着毛主席指引的航向，扎扎实实地稳步走在全市中学无产阶级文化大革命的前列。
    打了三个硬仗，实现以教学班为基础的革命大联合
    石景山中学是个有一千多师生的初级中学。执行军训任务的指战员初进校时，校内群众组织很多，各自为政，有的还在打“内战”。指战员们遵照毛主席的“三七”指示，参照天津延安中学进行军政训练的经验，首先抓了三件事：
    一、发动一场“人民战争”，对资产阶级反动路线给以歼灭性打击，在革命师生中树立毛主席的阶级分析观，帮助他们分清敌我友。
    指战员们首先组织大家学习毛主席的著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，结合这个学校阶级斗争的情况，分清两类不同性质的问题，帮助大家认清主要敌人是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。这样做的结果，团结教育了受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众，为实现以教学班为基础的革命大联合奠定了牢固的思想基础。
    二、开展整风，狠斗“私”字，大破小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性，回到班级闹革命。
    这个学校有二十七个跨班级、跨教研组的革命群众组织。他们的大方向是正确的，但不同程度地存在着山头主义、小团体主义和无政府主义的错误倾向。指战员们引导大家以“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》为武器，用团结——批评和自我批评——团结的方法，展开群众性的整风运动，使大家认识到这种错误倾向，是“私”字在作怪。经过斗“私”，各革命群众组织在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，联合了起来，按班、级、校系统统一了红卫兵组织，红卫兵小将纷纷回班闹革命。
    三、严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，大胆解放和使用干部，解放教师，按教学组织归口，为革命三结合铺平道路，为复课闹革命做好组织准备。
    指战员们首先鼓励犯错误的干部、教师大胆下班接触群众，同学生一起学习毛主席著作，一起批判资产阶级反动路线，消除资产阶级反动路线造成的干部、教师、学生之间的严重对立，使他们逐步建立起革命的感情。然后，发动群众对干部的错误和问题，进行充分揭发、批判，进行全面的阶级分析，分清了两类不同性质的矛盾，划清了革命和反革命、无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线、革命领导干部和走资本主义道路当权派的界限。犯错误的干部也主动地诚恳地进行了检查。在干部亮相后，广大革命师生满腔热情地欢迎他们站出来工作。七个领导干部中有三人参加了“三结合”的临时权力机构，有三人分配了适当的工作。对另一名犯有严重错误的干部，也本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的原则，让他边检查、边批判、边工作。这样就彻底粉碎了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，既锻炼了干部，又教育了群众，从思想上、组织上巩固了按班级的革命大联合。
    在革命大联合的洪流中，四个跨教研组的革命教师群众组织，也在革命原则的基础上，按行政组、业务分工归口，做好班级复课闹革命的组织准备。
    在风吹浪打中巩固和发展按班级的革命大联合
    毛主席教导说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”石景山中学按班级实现革命大联合，紧接着就严重地遭受到社会上无政府主义思潮的冲击。极少数师生认为这个学校按班级的革命大联合是“大杂烩”，退了出去，另立山头，与校外一些单位的组织联系，一次又一次地来冲击革命大联合，干扰复课闹革命。指战员们就领导革命师生反复学习毛主席的“三七”指示，反复研究延安中学以教学班为基础实现革命大联合的经验，反复检查自己按班级实现革命大联合的道路。他们坚信石景山中学按班级实现革命大联合是符合毛泽东思想的，是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的，一致表示决不动摇。这时，学生家长，工人，贫下中农积极支持这个学校按班级实现的革命大联合，鼓励革命师生勇敢地、坚决捍卫毛主席的“三七”指示。革命师生在指战员的帮助下，每受一次冲击，便自觉地进行一次听毛主席话，按班级进行革命大联合的自我教育；同时，认真找一次薄弱环节，进行自我批评，改进工作，不断为革命大联合补台。每冲击一次，按班级的革命大联合从组织上、思想上便更加巩固一步。
    另方面，担负军训任务的解放军指战员又和革命师生一起学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，端正对退出大联合的极少数师生的态度。通过家庭走访，个别谈心，征求意见，开展自我批评，对他们进行耐心细致的政治思想工作，做到早回来早欢迎，晚回来晚欢迎，回来一个欢迎一个，暂时不回来就继续耐心地做工作。现在退出大联合的二十多个师生已经陆续全部回来。全校召开了欢迎大会，欢迎他们回到各班级参加复课闹革命。
    按班级实现革命大联合，掀起大学习、大批判、复课闹革命的高潮
    石景山中学按班级实现革命大联合，建立革命的三结合后，经过半年多的实践，充分显示了它的优越性。
    按班级实现革命大联合优越性的第一个表现，就是把群众最广泛地组织起来活学活用毛主席著作。在没有实现按班级大联合之前，由于小山头割据，全校范围的群众性学习毛主席著作活动，往往组织不起来。一些群众组织学习毛主席著作，有时也由于派性作怪，只针对别人的问题进行指责，不用来解决自己的思想问题。按班级联合以后，最广泛地发动和组织了群众，迅速掀起了全校性的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。从学校到班级和个人，都把学习毛主席著作摆在首位，每天坚持一小时雷打不动的学习制度。全校组织了一百一十五个学习毛主席著作小组，绝大部分师生和许多家长都参加了进来，大大促进了革命师生的思想革命化。
    按班级实现革命大联合优越性的第二个表现，就是有力地开展了革命的大批判。以前的革命大批判，是由各群众组织分别进行，只能进行小而分散的战斗；加上各组织之间有派性斗争，往往转移了革命的大方向，削弱了对敌斗争。按班级实现革命大联合后，从全校到各班，结成最大的战斗兵团，统一思想，统一步调，统一目标，集中火力展开既轰轰烈烈又深入扎实的革命大批判，并结合本单位情况进行了斗、批、改。
    按班级实现革命大联合优越性的第三个表现，就是学生回班，教师归口，革命干部解放，有利于复课闹革命。广大革命师生从四月份按班级实现革命大联合以来，遵循毛主席教育革命的思想，大胆实践，大胆创新，一直坚持边上课，边批判，边教改的制度。上毛主席著作辅导课的时间占百分之三十，批判课占百分之四十，文化知识课如数学、物理、外语、音乐、体育等占百分之三十。在教学上，教师讲，学生也讲，教学相长，共同改进，共同提高。
    按班级实现革命大联合优越性的第四个表现，就是加强了学校的革命新秩序，克服了无政府状态。革命师生按班级统一行动，有利于克服小资产阶级派性，增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    活学活用毛主席著作的活动，开展革命大批判的活动，复课闹革命的活动，加强了革命新秩序，反过来又巩固和发展了按班级的革命大联合，促使按班级的革命大联合发挥更多的优越性，使这个学校的无产阶级文化大革命运动，沿着毛主席指引的航向顺利前进。　（据新华社十九日讯）（附图片）
