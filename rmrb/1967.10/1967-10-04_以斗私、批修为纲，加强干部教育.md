The great leader Chairman Mao recently called on us to use the four characters "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle to strengthen the ideological education of military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and care for the entire army, the cadres across the country, and the revolutionary youngsters of the Red Guards. It is a major strategic measure of far-reaching significance in the new situation of the victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All cadres in our army must resolutely respond and resolutely carry out this directive, seriously understand it, and seriously implement it.

Revolutionary cadres are a precious asset of the revolution. Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the ideological education of cadres and to educating and uniting the majority of cadres.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must be good at taking care of cadres." "Provide them with opportunities to study, educate them, and help them advance a step in theory and work ability." "Inspect their work, help them summarize experiences, promote achievements, and correct mistakes." "Generally, for cadres who have made mistakes, we should adopt the method of persuasion to help them correct their mistakes." "Only for those who have committed serious mistakes and do not accept guidance should we adopt the method of struggle."

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven that the vast majority of cadres in our army are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They not only followed Chairman Mao closely in the decades of revolutionary wars, making significant contributions to the revolutionary cause; in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the socialist period, they also followed Chairman Mao closely, establishing new merits for the people.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented revolutionary movement. The "three supports and two militaries" work is a new and arduous task. To adapt to the new situation of the rapid development of the socialist revolution and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to successfully complete the major historical tasks assigned by the Party and Chairman Mao, all our cadres need to study. Those who have made mistakes need to study, and those who have not made mistakes also need to participate in the study, together with everyone else, to summarize experiences and raise their political and ideological level. We need to ensure that the majority of cadres are educated and improved.

Strengthening the ideological education of cadres must be guided by the principle of "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." This is the only correct political direction for political and ideological education in the socialist period as indicated by Chairman Mao. To be guided by "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" means to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" in one's mind, to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism, and to struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The "self" is the core of the bourgeois worldview and the ideological root of the survival and development of revisionism. Only by criticizing revisionism and thoroughly eliminating the "self" from one's mind can one truly draw a clear line with revisionism, uproot revisionism, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, ensuring that our country will never change color.

To strengthen the education of cadres with the principle of "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," cadres must educate themselves. This means that we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people and the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," learn from past mistakes to prevent future ones, and cure the sickness to save the patient. Comrades should deeply understand the great leader Chairman Mao's affectionate care and expectations for us, and voluntarily engage in criticism and self-criticism. For one's own shortcomings and mistakes, the main approach is to use self-criticism, to reform oneself, to transform oneself, to eliminate the influence of revisionism, and to change one's worldview.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental way to strengthen the education of cadres. As long as comrades can connect the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, connect with their past work, and connect with their current thoughts, bringing questions to seriously read Chairman Mao's books and work hard on the "application," they will definitely be able to promote achievements, correct shortcomings or mistakes.

Let us, the great cadres of the People's Liberation Army, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses, pool our strengths and strive together to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and make greater contributions!

### 以斗私、批修为纲，加强干部教育

    以斗私、批修为纲，加强干部教育
    伟大领袖毛主席最近号召我们，要用“斗私，批修”这四个字为纲，加强对于军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。这是毛主席对全军、全国干部和红卫兵革命小将的最大关怀和爱护，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展新形势下的一项具有深远意义的重大战略措施。我军全体干部必须坚决响应，坚决照办，认真领会，认真执行。
    革命的干部，是革命的宝贵财富。毛主席历来十分重视干部的思想教育，十分重视教育和团结干部的大多数。
    毛主席指出：“必须善于爱护干部。”“给以学习的机会，教育他们，使他们在理论上在工作能力上提高一步”。“检查他们的工作，帮助他们总结经验，发扬成绩，纠正错误。”“对于犯错误的干部，一般地应采取说服的方法，帮助他们改正错误。”“只有对犯了严重错误而又不接受指导的人们，才应当采取斗争的方法。”
    一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的实践证明，我军广大干部都是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。他们不仅在几十年的革命战争中，紧跟毛主席，对革命事业作出了重要贡献；在社会主义时期两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，他们同样是紧跟毛主席，为人民立下新的功勋。
    无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的革命运动，“三支”“两军”工作是一个崭新的艰巨任务。为着适应社会主义革命和无产阶级文化大革命运动迅速向前发展的新形势，圆满完成党和毛主席交给我们的重大历史任务，我们的全体干部都需要学习。犯过错误的同志要学，没有犯过错误的同志也要参加学习，同大家一起，总结经验，提高自己的政治思想水平。要使广大干部普遍地受到教育，得到提高。
    加强干部思想教育必须以“斗私，批修”为纲。这是毛主席给我们指出的社会主义时期政治思想教育的唯一正确的政治方向。以“斗私，批修”为纲，就是要用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。“私”字是资产阶级世界观的核心，是修正主义生存和发展的思想根源。只有在批修的同时，从头脑中彻底铲除“私”字，才能真正同修正主义划清界线，挖掉修正主义的根子，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，保证我们国家永不变色。
    以“斗私，批修”为纲加强干部教育，要靠干部自己教育自己。这就是说，必须按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，惩前毖后，治病救人。同志们应该深刻体会伟大领袖毛主席对我们的亲切关怀和期望，自觉地进行批评和自我批评。对于自己的缺点和错误，主要的是通过自我批评，自己革自己的命，自己改造自己，肃清修正主义的影响，改造世界观。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是“斗私，批修”的强大武器，活学活用毛主席著作是加强干部教育的根本。同志们只要能够联系无产阶级文化大革命的形势，联系自己过去的工作，联系自己的活思想，带着问题认真地读毛主席的书，在“用”字上狠下功夫，就一定能够发扬成绩，纠正缺点或错误。
    让我们伟大的人民解放军干部同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一起，群策群力，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，作出更大的贡献！（十月四日）
