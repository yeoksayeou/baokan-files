Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and a close friend of the Chinese people, delivered an important speech at the reception held by the Chinese Embassy in Albania to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He sincerely wished that Comrade Mao Zedong would live as long as the mountains and that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China was a brilliant victory for Marxism-Leninism.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, TIRANA, Sept. 30 — Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and a close friend of the Chinese people, attended the reception held by the Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Tingquan, to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on September 29. Comrade Enver Hoxha delivered an important speech at the reception.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha first expressed that he, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, the Presidium of the People's Assembly, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, extended the warmest greetings and congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people, the heroic Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and to the great leader of the Chinese people and close friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha said: The Albanian people and the Party of Labor of Albania have deep internationalist sentiments and sincere love for their loyal friends and allies, the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and their beloved leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

	He said: The October 1st holiday is not only cherished by the fraternal Chinese people but also by the Albanian people and all revolutionary people around the world who love freedom. Therefore, this is a day of great joy for all of us.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out: Under the leadership of the experienced Communist Party of China, headed by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people, armed with weapons, went through a long revolutionary struggle against foreign imperialist invaders and domestic traitors, bravely and steadfastly overcoming unprecedented difficulties and obstacles, liberated their glorious homeland, and finally achieved the victory of the people's revolution, proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	October 1st is a great event of immense historical significance, marking a turning point that determines the future of China and opening up broad prospects for the victory of the socialist revolution worldwide. The victory of the Chinese socialist revolution fundamentally shattered the imperialist front, changed the balance of power in the world in favor of socialism, and is a great source of revolutionary inspiration and mobilization for the people of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism and for national and social liberation.

	He said: In the past 18 years of struggle and creative work, great strides have been made. Today, the People's Republic of China enjoys its well-deserved great international prestige. As a great center of the socialist revolution, as a staunch supporter of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of all countries who love freedom, and as a red banner of Marxism-Leninism, it is praised and respected.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha said: This year, the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is being celebrated in an atmosphere of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is being successfully carried out under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. The intense class struggle currently taking place in China shows the deep hatred of the revolutionary masses towards the enemies of Marxism-Leninism. This is a life-and-death struggle between the socialist line and the capitalist line, between revolution and counter-revolution, between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism.

	He said: The revisionists in China have been exposed, thoroughly denounced, and isolated. Their positions have been fundamentally destroyed, and their counter-revolutionary lines have been smashed and annihilated from all sides. The conspiracies and delusions of the imperialists and modern revisionists to repeat the tragedy of the Soviet Union in China have been shattered. What awaits them is only miserable failure. Great People's China will forever remain red and forever be the center of the socialist revolution and the invincible Marxism-Leninism. Marxist-Leninists, steadfast revolutionaries, and progressive people around the world are jubilant and united around the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

	He pointed out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is of great significance not only to China but also to all revolutionaries and the international communist and workers' movement worldwide. Especially for the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary working masses in countries where revisionists are in power, it provides great lessons on how to rise up and overthrow and annihilate the revisionist traitors who have usurped power and restored capitalism.

	The Albanian people, our Party, and government enthusiastically support and wholeheartedly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. We regard it as the greatest victory of the fraternal Chinese people since the victory of the armed revolution that led to the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. We regard it as our victory and the victory of all revolutionary people in the world, as a brilliant victory for Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, we sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater achievements on the glorious road to socialism and communism, and we wish Comrade Mao Zedong eternal life, as long as our mountains.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out: The current international situation is excellent. In all parts of the world, the initiative is in the hands of the forces and people who are making revolutions. Great socialist China, like a giant, is at the forefront and has become a reliable pillar.

	After denouncing and condemning the crimes of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership in colluding to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the world's people, Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out: The people of all countries have recognized that U.S. imperialists are their main enemy, and that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a dangerous and vicious enemy. They must also resolutely fight them mercilessly.

	He said: The resolute struggle of our two parties and countries, all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces, the world proletariat, and revolutionary people against our common enemies, imperialists and revisionists, is continuously achieving victories. The heroic struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people is a brilliant example of the power and superiority of people's revolutionary wars. Our Party, government, and people will always fully support this struggle until the final victory over the U.S. imperialist aggressors, which is undoubtedly inevitable. We hail the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which once again expresses the glorious Vietnamese people's determination to carry on their just and heroic struggle to the end, regardless of sacrifice.

	He pointed out: The power of the people is greater than the power of imperialism. They will definitely win. The revolution is advancing. Marxism-Leninism will inevitably defeat revisionism. Human history has entered an era where the socialist revolution will triumph worldwide, and the bloody oppression and slavery of capitalism will collapse.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha said: The traitors in Moscow actually have the audacity to invite our Party to participate in the "celebration" they are organizing in Moscow for the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. Our Party contemptuously rejected the dirty invitation from the Soviet revisionists. We will celebrate the great October Revolution in our homeland with joyous hearts.

	We, the communists and people of Albania, will continue to sing the praises of the October Revolution, Lenin, Stalin, the Bolsheviks, and the heroic brotherly Soviet people with whom we have maintained close ties in the past and present. Together with the Soviet people, we will smash the heads of the revisionist traitors and bury them through severe and unyielding struggles.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha said: Modern revisionists can only be toys in the hands of the bourgeoisie, only be obedient servants of the bourgeoisie. The fall of all revisionist parties is inevitable. New Marxist-Leninist parties have been established and will be established and tempered. This is an objective law.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha said: At this time when the forces of revolution and counter-revolution are engaged in a great struggle in the world, the Albanian people and their Party of Labor stand on the side of the 700 million Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party, and they are proud of it. The People's Republic of Albania, under the leadership of the Party of Labor, has always adhered to and will forever adhere to the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism. It has withstood and will forever bravely withstand all storms, the conspiracies and fierce attacks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, as well as the Khrushchev and Tito revisionists. China and Albania are forever united.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha finally said: At this moment when the 18th anniversary of the founding of the fraternal People's Republic of China is being celebrated, the great friendship and steel-like internationalist unity between our two peoples and countries are stronger than ever. The visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to the People's Republic of China will write a new page in the history of Albanian-Chinese friendship and brotherly cooperation, embodying the complete unity of thought and action between our two parties and countries. The Albanian people, who are enthusiastically implementing the magnificent program of the Fifth Party Congress to further revolutionize national life, sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people even greater and more glorious victories in this joyous day.

	Before Comrade Enver Hoxha's speech, Charge d'Affaires Li Tingquan first spoke. He said that this year, the 700 million Chinese people are celebrating this great holiday in the situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. In the process of this great revolution's deep development, the boundless Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated and further established its absolute authority among hundreds of millions of people.

	Li Tingquan pointed out that the revolutionary upsurge has promoted the upsurge of production and construction. Our people actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," resulting in a new situation of all-around leaps in the national economy. Our science and technology are reaching new heights. Our national defense capabilities have been raised to a higher level. Our country has never been so prosperous and strong.

	Li Tingquan said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has, for the first time in theory and practice, correctly solved the major historical question of how to carry out a revolution and prevent capitalist restoration under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This great revolutionary practice proves that Chairman Mao has creatively and epoch-makingly developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Charge d'Affaires Li Tingquan warmly praised the fraternal Albanian people for their revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor of Albania, and for their continuous achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	Li Tingquan highly praised the revolutionary measures taken by the Party of Labor of Albania and the government to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. He said that these revolutionary measures fully reflect the revolutionary daring and political foresight of the Party of Labor of Albania, led by the great communist warrior Comrade Enver Hoxha.

	This is another brilliant example of the Party of Labor of Albania, led by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, creatively combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of their own country. These revolutionary measures are the Party of Labor of Albania's new contribution to enriching Marxism-Leninism.

	After talking about the current excellent international situation, Li Tingquan expressed that the 700 million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will better fulfill their internationalist duties in international affairs in the future; the Chinese people are determined to fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries against imperialism and revisionism, and resolutely support the Albanian people's just struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the Greek reactionaries' attempt to invade Albania, vowing to be a strong backbone for the Albanian people.

	When enthusiastically praising the unbreakable friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, Li Tingquan said that currently, the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu is in our country participating in the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and conducting a friendly visit, which is the greatest support and encouragement for our Party and people. Undoubtedly, this visit will push the great proletarian internationalist friendship between the peoples of China and Albania to a new height and bring our mutual assistance and cooperation to a new stage of development.

	Those present at the reception included: Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, List, members and alternate members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor, Charchani, Nushi, Toska, Kaba, Mufitiu, Kolega, Kellezi, Hazbiu, Dumi, Piristri, and leaders of various departments of the Party, government, military, and mass organizations, as well as representatives of some factories, mines, and agricultural cooperatives, totaling hundreds of people.

	Members of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association delegation led by Wang Shousheng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Minister of National Defense, and members of the Chinese Scientific Workers' Delegation, who are visiting Albania, also attended the reception.

	Diplomatic envoys from some countries to Albania also attended the reception.

	At the reception, guests and hosts had cordial conversations, stood up several times, and toasted to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and to the ironclad friendship between China and Albania, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and has been tempered in the common struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

	Previously, Charge d'Affaires Li Tingquan held a National Day film reception on the 26th. The Chinese film "South-North Campaign" was screened at the reception and was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

    霍查同志在我驻阿使馆举行的国庆招待会上发表重要讲话
    衷心地祝愿毛泽东同志象高山一样长寿
    中国文化大革命是马列主义的辉煌胜利
    新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密朋友霍查同志九月二十九日出席了中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃举行的庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年招待会。霍查同志在会上发表了重要讲话。
    霍查同志首先表示，他代表阿尔巴尼亚人民，劳动党中央委员会，人民议会主席团和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，向兄弟的中国人民，英雄的中国共产党，中华人民共和国政府，向中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民亲密的朋友毛泽东同志，致以最热烈的敬意和祝贺。
    霍查同志说：阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，对他们的忠实朋友和盟友，对伟大的中国人民，对光荣的中国共产党及其敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志，怀着深厚的国际主义情谊和真挚的热爱。
    我国人民和我们党认为，十月一日这一节日，不仅是兄弟的中国人民所珍爱的，也是阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界所有爱好自由的革命人民所珍爱的。因此，这是我们大家都十分欢乐的节日。
    霍查同志指出：兄弟的中国人民，在以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，手拿武器，经过抗击外国帝国主义侵略者和本国卖国贼的长期革命斗争，英勇和坚定地克服了罕见的困难险阻，解放了自己的光荣的祖国，终于取得了人民革命的胜利，宣告了中华人民共和国的成立。
    十月一日，是具有巨大历史意义的大事，标志着决定中国的未来的一个转折点，为世界范围的社会主义革命的胜利打开了广阔的前景。中国社会主义革命的胜利，从根本上粉碎了帝国主义阵线，改变了世界的力量对比而有利于社会主义，对于为抗击帝国主义和殖民主义，为争取民族和社会解放而斗争的各国人民来说，是革命的鼓舞和动员的巨大的泉源。
    他说：伟大的人民中国在过去十八年的斗争和创造性的工作中，迈出了巨大的步伐。今天，中华人民共和国享有应得的巨大国际威望，她作为社会主义革命的伟大中心，作为爱好自由的各国人民反帝斗争的坚决支持者，作为马克思列宁主义的红彤彤的旗手，受到赞扬和尊敬。
      霍查同志说：今年，是在毛泽东主席亲自领导下的无产阶级文化大革命正在各地顺利开展、取得辉煌胜利的气氛中，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。目前在中国激烈地开展的阶级斗争，表明了革命群众对马克思列宁主义的死敌的深仇大恨，这是一场社会主义路线和资本主义路线、革命和反革命、马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间的生死搏斗。
    他说：中国的修正主义分子已经被揪出来，被充分揭露和孤立。他们的阵地已经从根本上被粉碎，他们的反革命阵线已经从四面八方被打垮和消灭。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者企图使苏联的悲剧在中国重演的种种阴谋和妄想已经被粉碎。等待着他们的只是悲惨的失败，伟大的人民中国将永远保持红色，永远是社会主义革命和战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的中心。世界各国的马克思列宁主义者，坚定不移的革命者和进步人民欢欣鼓舞，团结在中华人民共和国和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的周围。
    他指出：无产阶级文化大革命不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界一切革命派以及国际共产主义和工人运动都具有十分重大的意义。特别是对于修正主义者当权的那些国家的马克思列宁主义者和革命的劳动群众有很大的教益，向他们指明如何起来推翻和消灭篡夺权力和复辟资本主义的修正主义叛徒。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，我们党和政府，欢呼和热烈支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命。我们把它看作是兄弟的中国人民继导致一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立的武装革命胜利之后的最伟大的胜利，看作是我们的胜利和全世界一切革命人民的胜利，看作是马克思列宁主义的辉煌胜利。因此，我们衷心祝愿兄弟的中国人民在社会主义和共产主义的光辉道路上取得更大的成就，祝愿毛泽东同志万寿无疆，象我们的高山一样长寿。
    霍查同志指出：目前，国际形势一片大好。在世界各地，主动权掌握在起来闹革命的力量和人民手中。伟大的社会主义中国，象巨人一样走在最前列，已成为他们的可靠支柱。
    霍查同志在揭露和谴责美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团互相勾结破坏世界人民革命斗争的罪行后指出：世界各国人民认清美帝国主义者是他们的主要敌人，认清苏修领导集团是危险和恶毒的敌人，必须同样坚决地与之进行无情的斗争。
    他说：我们两党和两国，所有的马克思列宁主义政党和力量，世界无产阶级和革命人民，对我们的共同敌人帝国主义者和修正主义者所进行的坚决斗争，正在不断取得胜利。兄弟的英雄越南人民的英勇斗争，是人民革命战争的威力和优越性的光辉范例。我们党、我国政府和人民将始终全力支持这一斗争，直到取得对美帝国主义侵略者的最后胜利为止，这个最后胜利是毫无疑义的是必然的。我们欢呼越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领，这个政治纲领再一次表达了光荣的越南人民不怕牺牲，要把他们的正义和英勇斗争进行到底，直到胜利的坚定决心。
    他指出：人民的力量比帝国主义力量强大。他们一定会胜利。革命在前进。马克思列宁主义必然地要战胜修正主义。人类历史已经进入了社会主义革命在世界范围内胜利、资本主义的血腥压迫的奴役制度崩溃的时代。
    霍查同志说：莫斯科的叛徒们居然有脸邀请我们党去参加他们将在莫斯科为伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年组织的“庆祝大典”。我们党轻蔑地拒绝了苏联修正主义者的肮脏邀请。我们将在我们的祖国以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝伟大的十月革命。
    我们阿尔巴尼亚的共产党人和人民将一如既往地怀着感激的心情歌颂十月革命，歌颂列宁、斯大林，歌颂布尔什维克们以及我们过去和现在都保持紧密联系的英雄的兄弟的苏联人民，我们和苏联人民一起将通过严峻和不屈不挠的斗争砸烂苏修叛徒之流的脑袋，并且把他们埋葬。
    霍查同志说：现代修正主义者只能是资产阶级手中的玩物，只能是资产阶级的驯服的卖力的奴才。各修正主义政党的覆灭是不可避免的。新的马克思列宁主义政党已经建立和将要建立，并且将要受到锻炼。这是一个客观规律。
    霍查同志说：在今天世界上革命力量和反革命力量正在进行的巨大搏斗的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的劳动党站在七亿中国人民和他们的光荣的共产党一边，他们为此感到自豪。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在劳动党的领导下，一向坚持并将永远坚持马克思列宁主义的不朽原则，它顶住了并且将永远英勇地顶住一切风暴，顶住美帝国主义及其走狗以及赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义分子的阴谋和猛烈攻击。中国和阿尔巴尼亚是永远连结在一起的。
    霍查同志最后说：在兄弟的中华人民共和国建国十八周年庆典的时刻，我们两国人民和两国之间的伟大友谊和钢铁般的国际主义团结，比任何时候都更加坚强。由谢胡同志率领的我国党政代表团这次对中华人民共和国的访问，将在阿中友好关系和兄弟合作的历史上写下新的一页，是我们两党两国思想完全一致、行动完全一致的又一体现。正在以巨大的革命热情着手把党的第五次代表大会关于使国家生活进一步革命化的雄伟纲领变为现实的阿尔
  巴尼亚人民，在兄弟的中国人民的这一欢乐节日中，衷心祝愿他们取得更加辉煌、更加伟大的胜利。
    在霍查同志讲话之前，李庭荃临时代办首先讲话。他说，今年，七亿中国人民是在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的情况下，欢庆这一伟大节日的。在这场大革命的深入发展过程中，光焰无际的毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及、大传播，进一步在亿万人民中树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    李庭荃指出，革命高潮促进了生产建设的高潮。我国人民积极响应毛主席关于
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，使国民经济出现了全面跃进的新局面。我们的科学技术正在攀登新的高峰。我们的国防力量提高到了更高的水平。我国从来没有这样繁荣，这样强大。
    李庭荃说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，在理论上、实践上第一次正确地解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下，进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的重大历史课题。这一伟大革命的实践证明，毛主席创造性地、划时代地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。
    李庭荃临时代办热烈赞扬兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民在伟大的领袖霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中，不断取得的辉煌成就。
    李庭荃高度赞扬阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府为了把社会主义革命进行到底而采取的革命化措施。他说，这些革命化措施充分地表现了以伟大的共产主义战士霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的革命胆略和政治远见。
    这是以伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同本国具体实践相结合的又一个光辉的范例。这些革命化措施，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党对丰富马克思列宁主义的新贡献。
    李庭荃在谈到当前一片大好的国际形势后表示，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，今后在国际事务中将更好地履行自己的国际主义的义务；中国人民决心全力支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持世界各国革命人民反帝反修斗争，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民反对帝国主义、修正主义以及反对希腊反动派妄图侵犯阿尔巴尼亚的正义斗争，誓做阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。
    李庭荃在热情赞扬中阿两党、两国和两国人民建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的牢不可破的友谊时说，目前，由谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团正在我国参加中华人民共和国成立十八周年的庆祝活动并进行友好访问，这是对我们党和我国人民的最大支持和鼓舞。毫无疑问，这一访问将把中阿两国人民之间的无产阶级国际主义的伟大友谊推向新的高峰，把我们之间的互助合作关系推向一个新的发展阶段。
    出席招待会的有：阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希、劳动党中央政治局委员和候补委员查尔查尼、努什、托斯卡、卡博、穆夫蒂乌、科列加、凯莱齐、哈兹比乌、杜米、皮里斯特里以及党、政、军各部门和各群众团体负责人，一些工矿企业和农业合作社的代表等数百人。
