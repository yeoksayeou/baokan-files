Albania's cement industry has seen significant development in recent years. The amount of cement produced in the first four months of this year equals the total production of 1960. The new modern cement plant that began operations in the Kruja region at the end of last year not only greatly increased cement production but also expanded the variety of products. This plant can now produce high-quality anti-seismic cement. The newly built Tirana cement plant also successfully trial-produced decorative white cement this year. Next year, Albania's cement production will see a significant increase. After the large cement plant currently under construction in Elbasan begins operations, Albania, which was once a cement-importing country, will not only be self-sufficient in cement but will also export it in large quantities.

    水泥工业迅速发展
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚水泥工业近年来有较大发展。今年四个月的水泥生产量就等于一九六○年全年的产量。去年年底在克鲁亚地区投入生产的新的现代化水泥厂，不仅使水泥产量大大增加，而且扩大了产品品种。这个厂已能生产高质量的防震水泥。新建的地拉那水泥厂，今年也试产成功了供装饰用的白水泥。明年，阿尔巴尼亚的水泥生产还会有大幅度增长。正在爱尔巴桑兴建的另一个大型水泥厂投入生产后，曾经是水泥进口国的阿尔巴尼亚，在水泥方面不仅能自给，而且还将大量出口。
