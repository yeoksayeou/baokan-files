Our banner is the great Chinese Communist Party, the great leader Chairman Mao – The revolutionary masses of the three services hold a meeting to denounce the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution"

The Chinese Khrushchev, in his "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution" published on October 10, 1942, concentrated and blatantly peddled a set of fallacies aimed at eliminating the leadership of the proletarian revolution. He brazenly extolled Chiang Kai-shek as the "banner of revolution," absurdly claiming that the Kuomintang was the "most popular, legal, best, and ready-made form" of the anti-Japanese national united front. He even propagated that "the Chinese revolution can be carried out under the banner of the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang, at least for the democratic revolution, it would be much smoother than using any other banner." The essence of this fallacy is to openly hand over the leadership of the revolution to the big landlord class and the big comprador class, attempting to drag China back to the dark old road of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society.

Recently, the revolutionary masses of the three services of the General Departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the leadership organs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force held a meeting to thoroughly criticize the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," focusing on criticizing the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The participants in the criticism meeting included the revolutionary masses of the General Staff Department, the General Political Department, the General Logistics Department, the Beijing Military Region, the direct organs of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the "Red Alliance" of the direct organs of the Navy, the revolutionary masses of the direct organs of the Air Force, the revolutionary masses of the Signal Corps, the revolutionary masses of the Armored Corps, the revolutionary masses of the Artillery Corps, the revolutionary masses of the Second Artillery Corps, the revolutionary masses of the Chemical Defense Corps, and the revolutionary masses of the Engineering Corps, totaling thirteen units. This meeting was a battle meeting held on the basis of revolutionary great unity, concentrating firepower to launch a fierce attack on the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the Party. The broad masses of revolutionary soldiers of the three services, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously refuted the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev. Each speech was a sharp sword, piercing through the Chinese Khrushchev's disguise; each speech was a cannon shell, hitting the Chinese Khrushchev's vital points. In the face of the mighty power of the revolutionary criticism, the old opportunism, old capitulationism, and old counter-revolutionary nature of the Chinese Khrushchev were once again exposed nakedly!

The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "If you want a revolution, you must have a revolutionary party." "Without the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, without the Chinese Communist Party members being the backbone of the Chinese people, China's independence and liberation would be impossible, and China's industrialization and modernization of agriculture would also be impossible." The Chinese Khrushchev wants to oppose the revolution and betray the revolution, and first of all, he wants to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party and eliminate the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the Chinese revolution. The broad masses of revolutionary soldiers of the three services angrily denounced the counter-revolutionary fallacies in the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution."

The speakers pointed out: The banner is the program of the class, the symbol of leadership. Who is the banner leading the Chinese revolution? Is it the proletariat or the bourgeoisie? Is it the Communist Party or the Kuomintang? This is a key issue concerning the success or failure of the Chinese revolution. Whether to raise the banner of the Communist Party or the banner of the Kuomintang is the mark of revolution or counter-revolution, the mark of resistance or capitulation.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were two great banners. One was the red banner of revolutionary resistance and salvation, held high by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. All revolutionary and anti-Japanese people gathered under this banner to bravely fight for the great historical task of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. The other was the white banner of capitulation and betrayal, held by Chiang Kai-shek, the representative of the big landlord and big bourgeoisie. All big landlords, big gentry, big warlords, big officials, big compradors, and all big and small traitors gathered under this banner to carry out the evil deeds of dictatorship, betrayal, anti-communism, and anti-people. The Chinese Khrushchev actually wanted us to put down the red banner of revolution and run to the counter-revolutionary banner of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek to carry out "democratic revolution" and "resistance against Japan," which is thoroughgoing capitulationism and the greatest betrayal of the people's revolution.

The speakers said with class hatred: What is the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek? The Kuomintang is the political representative of the big landlord class and the big comprador class, and Chiang Kai-shek is their leader, a traitor to the nation, and an enemy of the people. They are the puppets of imperialism and directly serve imperialism, representing the most backward and reactionary production relations in China, and are extreme counter-revolutionaries. It was this Chiang Kai-shek who, in 1927, betrayed the revolution and carried out the April 12 massacre. It was this Chiang Kai-shek who, in the early 1930s, mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops to launch five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. It was this Chiang Kai-shek who, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, adopted a policy of passive resistance and active anti-communism, concentrating his efforts on massacring the Chinese people. This traitor who brought disaster to the country and committed heinous crimes is the object of the revolution. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, shamelessly, praised this object of the revolution as the banner of revolution. This is the ironclad evidence that the Chinese Khrushchev wants to capitulate and does not want revolution; wants the Kuomintang and does not want the Communist Party. Is this tolerable?

The speakers also pointed out that the Chinese Khrushchev's call to carry out the democratic revolution under the "banner of the Three Principles of the People" is a thoroughgoing betrayal of the revolution. Chairman Mao has long pointed out in "On New Democracy" that communism and the Three Principles of the People are fundamentally different not only in their worldview, in the thoroughness of their revolution, and in whether there is a socialist revolutionary stage, but also in some of their programs during the democratic revolutionary stage. Moreover, the reactionary Kuomintang, with Chiang Kai-shek as its representative, is not advocating the new Three Principles of the People, but the old Three Principles of the People. What is this old Three Principles of the People? Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Their nationalism is to collude with imperialism; their democracy is to oppress the people; their livelihood is to drink the blood of the people as much as possible." The Chinese Khrushchev, following the reactionary Kuomintang, praised this old Three Principles of the People, which is essentially to serve the reactionary Kuomintang's call to "abolish communism." However, the Chinese Khrushchev's foolish dream will never come true. Whether in the past, present, or future, the Chinese people will always remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The current world relies on communism as a savior," "This is something that cannot be 'abolished,' if it is abolished, China will perish."

The revolutionary soldiers of the three services said: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." Whether it is the bourgeois democratic revolution or the proletarian socialist revolution, the responsibility for leading these two revolutions lies with the proletarian party of China—the Chinese Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, no revolution can succeed. The Chinese Communist Party is the sole banner leading the Chinese revolution. Only under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party can the ship of the Chinese revolution sail from victory to victory. The Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to hand over the banner of proletarian leadership of the revolution to the enemy is something we will never agree to!

Without armed struggle, there can be no victory for the revolution

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of state power. Where does state power come from? Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The Chinese Khrushchev, who opposes the revolution and betrays the revolution, must necessarily oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and abolish the guns of the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev's publication of the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution" to propagate the line of capitulationism has another evil purpose: to attempt to make the proletariat hand over their guns and abolish armed struggle.

At the criticism meeting, the revolutionary masses of the three services indignantly exposed the Chinese Khrushchev's conspiracy.

Many comrades said excitedly: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without armed struggle, there would be no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." This is the experience of several decades, bought with blood, and must not be forgotten. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, has always been at odds with Chairman Mao and has always opposed armed struggle.

As early as the period of the First Revolutionary Civil War, the Chinese Khrushchev actively promoted the right-opportunist capitulationist line of Chen Duxiu, opposing the Party's leadership of the workers and peasants in seizing state power. In 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary coup, the Chinese Khrushchev ordered the workers' picket force in Wuhan to surrender their weapons to the Kuomintang. In 1936, he completely agreed with Wang Ming's capitulationism, advocating the surrender of the people's armed forces. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he advocated "uniting all anti-Japanese armed forces in North China under the leadership of the Central Military Commission of the Kuomintang" and "implementing the unified strategic intentions of the Central Military Commission in strategy and the unified anti-Japanese policies of the Central Government in policy." However, after the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the second wave of anti-communist attacks in 1942, in the face of the bloody lessons of the New Fourth Army Incident, this old traitor actually wanted to hand over the leadership of the revolution to the tyrant and traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Isn't this the most blatant surrender of military power and guns?

The speakers angrily said: The established policy of the class enemy is to eliminate the Communist Party. And to eliminate the Communist Party, the most fundamental thing is to eliminate the people's armed forces led by our Party. This is the core of the class enemy's counter-revolutionary policy. The enemy has never abandoned this policy. The Chinese Khrushchev, obsequiously, praised the tyrant and traitor as the "leader" and "banner," which essentially means to abolish the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the revolutionary base areas led by the Communist Party, to obey the "military orders and political orders" of the class enemy, and to become the "tame tool" of the class enemy. This is a great betrayal of the interests of the people, a great betrayal of the interests of the nation. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's armed forces, every gun, every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be surrendered." Whoever dares to make us surrender our weapons, we will fight to the end with them!

With struggle for unity, unity exists; with compromise for unity, unity perishes

The united front is one of the three magic weapons for our Party to defeat the enemy. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," used the trick of substituting one thing for another to attempt to replace Chairman Mao's revolutionary united front with his capitulationist united front. The revolutionary masses of the three services, armed with the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly exposed and criticized his conspiracy.

The speakers first analyzed what kind of united front should be established during the War of Resistance Against Japan. They believed that it must be the "national united front" as indicated by Chairman Mao, the "united front of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants who love their country." Only such a truly revolutionary united front can "mobilize all forces to strive for victory in the war of resistance." However, the Chinese Khrushchev absurdly claimed that the Kuomintang was the "most popular, legal, best, and ready-made form" of the anti-Japanese united front. Isn't this clearly advocating that everything be unified under the Kuomintang? This is even more thorough than Wang Ming's capitulationist policy of "everything through the united front, everything subject to the united front," completely serving the Kuomintang's poisonous plot of "limiting, dissolving, and opposing the Communist Party," attempting to let the reactionaries swallow the Communist Party whole. Such a united front is a genuine counter-revolutionary united front!

The speakers pointed out that the anti-Japanese united front should be unified under what? The speakers pointed out that it must be unified under the anti-Japanese war, unified under unity, and unified under progress. Anti-Japanese war, unity, and progress are the three bases of unity at that time. But the Chinese Khrushchev completely played the role of a spokesman for Japanese imperialism and the big landlord and big bourgeoisie, proposing a set of "unification theory" that is completely at odds with Chairman Mao. In his fallacies, anti-Japanese war, unity, and progress are all discarded, leaving only bare "unification." What is the essence of this "unification"? Chairman Mao has long pointed out that this is to "eliminate the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the democratic anti-Japanese base areas, to eliminate all anti-Japanese forces in various places, so as to be unified under the Kuomintang." This is the unification theory of capitulationism, the unification theory of national betrayal.

The speakers criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies from the strategic issues of the united front. They said that Chairman Mao pointed out: "During the period of the anti-Japanese united front, struggle is the means of unity, and unity is the goal of struggle. Struggle for unity, unity exists; compromise for unity, unity perishes." The revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao advocates both unity and independence; both alliance and struggle. That is, on the basis of the common program of the united front, insist on the principle of the Communist Party's independence in the united front, and insist on the Party's independence in ideology, politics, and organization. That is, adopt the correct policy of developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and opposing diehard forces. However, the capitulationist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev only wants unity, not independence; only wants alliance, not struggle. This is to achieve the evil purpose of abolishing the Communist Party under the banner of the Kuomintang's "one-party dictatorship." This is to eliminate progressive forces, suppress intermediate forces, and expand diehard forces under the pretext of "unification."

Finally, the broad masses of soldiers criticized the Chinese Khrushchev on the issue of who leads whom in the united front. They pointed out: In the united front, is it the proletariat leading the bourgeoisie, or the bourgeoisie leading the proletariat? This not only relates to whether the anti-Japanese national united front can be maintained and the anti-Japanese war can be won during that period, but also relates to the question of where China will go after the victory of the anti-Japanese war. The proletariat must firmly grasp the leadership of the united front and never allow the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the Party to sell out this leadership.

Abandoning principles and boasting of "flexibility" is sheer capitulationism

The Chinese Khrushchev, in the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," shamelessly peddled the black goods of class capitulationism and national capitulationism, attempting to abolish the leadership of the proletariat in the Chinese revolution. However, he brazenly said that this was "out of the need for tactics at that time."

The revolutionary masses of the three services unanimously asked: Whose tactics need this?

The speakers analyzed the situation at that time, pointing out that it was precisely after the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the second wave of anti-communist attacks. Not only had a part of the big bourgeoisie in the Kuomintang, represented by Wang Jingwei, already surrendered to Japanese imperialism, but another part of the big bourgeoisie, represented by Chiang Kai-shek, had also openly revealed their sinister faces of passive resistance, active anti-communism, and preparation for surrender. The activities of the Chiang-Wang alliance had never stopped, and the messengers between Ningbo and Chongqing were unceasing. Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale anti-communist wave, and the Japanese puppet army also directed its full force towards the liberated areas. They were in close cooperation, attempting to strangle the Party and the army that insisted on resistance. Facing this serious situation, Chairman Mao taught us: "When the Kuomintang's diehard anti-communists resolutely carry out their policy of preventing, limiting, and opposing communism and use this as a preparation for surrendering to Japan, we should emphasize struggle, not unity, otherwise it would be a great mistake." "Any revolutionary force of the people, if it wants to avoid being eliminated by Chiang Kai-shek and force him to acknowledge the existence of this force, has no other way but to struggle against his counter-revolutionary policy in a tit-for-tat manner."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev blatantly defied Chairman Mao's instructions and sang a different tune. He actually wanted to "unify" the Party and the army under the Kuomintang, making the traitor Chiang Kai-shek the "banner." This fully shows that the Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "out of the need for tactics at that time" is out of the need for tactics to save the dying Chiang dynasty, out of the need for tactics to surrender to Japanese imperialism. In a word, it is out of the need for tactics of national capitulationism of the big landlord class and the big comprador class.

The broad masses of soldiers further pointed out that the Chinese Khrushchev also repeatedly advocated in this poisonous weed that tactics need to have great "flexibility" and "practicality." Unmasking his trick, people clearly saw that his goods were to flexibly and practically adapt to the needs of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

It was this Chinese Khrushchev who, during the work in the white areas, in order to save the lives of a few traitors, under the pretext of tactical flexibility, instructed Communist Party members to surrender to the enemy in prison and to publish anti-communist statements in newspapers. It was this Chinese Khrushchev who, after the victory of the anti-Japanese war, in order to beg for a position in the reactionary government, under the pretext of tactical flexibility, attempted to sell out the people's state power and the people's army. It was this Chinese Khrushchev who, after the national liberation, in order to restore capitalism, under the pretext of tactical flexibility, advocated "exploitation is meritorious" and ordered workers and peasants to willingly "welcome" the exploitation of capitalists and rich peasants.

In short, the Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "flexibility" and "practicality" in tactics are sheer capitulationism. This is completely contrary to the flexibility in tactics advocated by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The flexibility in tactics advocated by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is based on the firmness of principles. The Chinese Khrushchev abandoned the firmness of principles to boast of the flexibility in tactics, which is opportunism and revisionism, and is the traitor's theory that adapts to the needs of the class enemy.

The revolutionary masses of the three services, in the criticism meeting, thoroughly exposed the traitorous face of the Chinese Khrushchev's capitulation and betrayal, unanimously pointing out: This old counter-revolutionary, in the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," shamelessly praised the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, shamelessly praised the political representative of the big landlord class and the big bourgeoisie, the Kuomintang. This is completely not the strategy and tactics of revolution, but the strategy and tactics of revisionism and capitulationism; this is completely not the strategy and tactics of the proletariat, but the strategy and tactics of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. The fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev in this poisonous weed completely cater to the needs of the big landlord class and the big bourgeoisie to abolish the Chinese Communist Party politically, ideologically, and organizationally, to abolish the people's armed forces, and to strangle the Chinese revolution. Publicly abandoning the leadership of the proletariat in the Chinese revolution, publicly betraying the interests of the Party and the people, and publicly opposing and betraying the revolution, this is the essence of the poisonous weed "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," and it is also the serious crime of the Chinese Khrushchev's consistent pursuit of the capitalist road for forty years. The revolutionary masses of the three services, who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao and swear to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, launch a fierce attack on the vital points of the Chinese Khrushchev, and thoroughly settle the accounts with the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary masses of the three services will definitely firmly grasp the gun, bravely defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and carry the socialist revolution to the end.

　　我们的旗帜是伟大的中国共产党，伟大的领袖毛主席
　　——三军无产阶级革命派举行大会怒斥大毒草《中国革命的战略与策略问题》
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在一九四二年十月十日发表的《中国革命的战略与策略问题》这株大毒草中，集中地、露骨地贩卖了一套取消无产阶级革命领导权的谬论。他公然吹捧蒋介石是“革命的旗帜”，胡说国民党是抗日民族统一战线“最通俗的、合法的、最好的、现成的形式”，甚至宣扬“中国革命能在国民党三民主义这面旗帜下进行，至少是民主革命这一段，要比用其他的旗子顺利得多”。这套谬论的实质，是公然要把革命的领导权拱手让给大地主阶级和大买办阶级，妄图把中国拉回半殖民地半封建社会的黑暗的老路。
    最近，中国人民解放军各总部、国防科委和陆海空三军领导机关的无产阶级革命派，联合举行了彻底批判大毒草《中国革命的战略与策略问题》的大会，集中批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的这一谬论。
    参加批判大会的，有总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派，总政治部机关无产阶级革命派，总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派，北京部队机关无产阶级革命派，国防科委直属机关无产阶级革命派，海军直属机关“红联总”，空军直属机关无产阶级革命派，通讯兵机关无产阶级革命派，装甲兵机关无产阶级革命派，炮兵机关无产阶级革命派，第二炮兵机关无产阶级革命派，防化学兵机关无产阶级革命派，工程兵机关无产阶级革命派等十三个单位。这个大会，是一个在革命大联合的基础上，集中火力，猛攻党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的战斗大会。三军无产阶级革命派广大指战员，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠狠驳斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论。每一篇发言，就是一把利剑，戳穿了中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮；每一篇发言，就是一颗炮弹，击中了中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。在革命大批判的威力面前，中国赫鲁晓夫的老机会主义、老投降主义、老反革命的丑恶本质又一次赤裸裸地暴露出来了！
    领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席英明指出：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。”“没有中国共产党的努力，没有中国共产党人做中国人民的中流砥柱，中国的独立和解放是不可能的，中国的工业化和农业近代化也是不可能的。”中国赫鲁晓夫要反对革命、出卖革命，首先就要取消中国共产党，取消中国共产党对中国革命的领导。三军无产阶级革命派的广大指战员，愤怒地痛斥了《中国革命的战略与策略问题》这株大毒草中的反革命谬论。
    发言的同志们指出：旗帜，是阶级的纲领，是领导权的象征。谁是领导中国革命的旗帜？是无产阶级还是资产阶级？是共产党还是国民党？这是关系到中国革命成败的关键问题。打着共产党的旗帜，还是打着国民党的旗帜，这是革命还是反革命的标志，是抗战还是投降的标志。
    在抗日战争时期，存在着两面大旗。一面是红色的抗日救国的革命大旗，由毛主席领导的中国共产党高举着。一切革命的抗日的人民集合在这面旗帜之下，为完成反帝反封建的伟大历史任务而英勇奋斗。一面是白色的投降卖国的反革命大旗，由大地主大资产阶级的总代表国民党蒋介石举着。一切大土豪、大劣绅、大军阀、大官僚、大买办，以及大大小小的汉奸卖国贼，都集合在这面旗帜之下，进行独裁、卖国、反共、反人民的罪恶勾当。中国的赫鲁晓夫，竟要我们放下红色的革命大旗，跑到国民党、蒋介石的反革命旗帜下面去进行“民主革命”和“抗日战争”，这是彻头彻尾的投降主义，这是对人民革命的最大背叛。
    发言的同志们满怀阶级仇恨地说，国民党和蒋介石是什么东西？国民党是大地主阶级和大买办阶级的政治代表，蒋介石是他们的总头子，是民族罪人，人民公敌。他们是帝国主义所豢养的，并直接为帝国主义服务的，代表中国最落后、最反动的生产关系，是极端的反革命派。就是这个蒋介石，在一九二七年叛变革命，制造了惨绝人寰的四·一二大屠杀。就是这个蒋介石，于三十年代初期，调动了上百万的兵力，对中国工农红军连续发起五次“围剿”。就是这个蒋介石，在抗日战争期间，采取消极抗日，积极反共的投降卖国政策，集中力量屠杀中国人民。这个祸国殃民、罪大恶极的家伙，是革命的对象。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫，却在皖南事变烈士血迹未干的时候，恬不知耻地把这个革命的对象捧为革命旗帜。这是中国赫鲁晓夫要投降，不要革命；要国民党，不要共产党的铁证。是可忍，孰不可忍？
    指战员们同时指出，中国赫鲁晓夫当时叫嚷要在“三民主义这面旗帜”下进行民主革命，也是对革命的彻头彻尾的背叛。毛主席在《新民主主义论》中早已明确指出，共产主义和三民主义，不但在宇宙观上、在革命的彻底性上，在有无社会主义革命阶段上，是根本不同的，而且在民主革命阶段上，也有一部分纲领不相同。何况，以人民公敌蒋介石为代表的国民党反动派，他们所叫嚷的根本不是新范畴的三民主义，而是旧范畴的伪三民主义。这种伪三民主义是什么玩意呢？毛主席一针见血地指出：“他们的民族主义，就是勾结帝国主义；他们的民权主义，就是压迫老百姓；他们的民生主义呢，那就是拿老百姓身上的血来喝得越多越好。”中国的赫鲁晓夫竟跟着国民党反动派一起吹捧这种三民主义，实质上就是为国民党反动派的“收起共产主义”的叫嚣效劳。不过，中国赫鲁晓夫的这种痴心妄想是永远不可能实现的。无论是过去、现在和将来，中国人民永远牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“现在的世界，依靠共产主义做救星”，“这是‘收起’不得的，一收起，中国就会亡国。”
    三军无产阶级革命派的战士们说：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”中国的革命，无论是资产阶级民主主义革命，还是无产阶级社会主义革命，这两重革命的领导责任，都担负在中国无产阶级的政党——中国共产党的肩上。离开了中国共产党的领导，任何革命都不可能成功。中国共产党是领导中国革命的唯一的旗帜，只有中国共产党这面旗帜，才能引导中国革命的航船，从胜利走向胜利。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想把无产阶级领导革命的旗帜，拱手让给敌人，我们一万个不答应！
    离开了武装斗争，就没有革命的胜利
    革命的根本问题，是政权问题。政权从何而来？毛主席精辟地指出：“枪杆子里面出政权”。中国赫鲁晓夫要反对革命，出卖革命，必然要反对无产阶级专政，取消无产阶级的枪杆子。中国赫鲁晓夫抛出《中国革命的战略与策略问题》这株大毒草，宣扬投降主义路线的另一个罪恶目的，就是妄图让无产阶级交出枪杆子，取消武装斗争。
    三军无产阶级革命派在批判大会上，义愤填膺地揭穿了中国赫鲁晓夫的这一阴谋。
    许多同志激动地说：毛主席教导我们：“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”这是几十年用血换来的经验，千万不能忘记。中国的赫鲁晓夫却一贯和毛主席唱反调，一贯反对武装斗争。
    早在第一次国内革命战争时期，中国赫鲁晓夫就积极推行陈独秀的右倾投降主义路线，反对党领导工农群众去夺取政权。一九二七年，蒋介石发动反革命政变，中国赫鲁晓夫就勒令武汉工人纠察队向国民党交出武装。一九三六年，他完全和王明的投降主义相唱和，主张把人民武装交出去。抗日战争初期，他主张“把所有华北的抗日武装部队联合起来，受国民党中央军事委员会的领导”，“在战略上必须实行中央军事委员会统一的战略意图，在政策上必须实行中央政府统一的抗日政策”。而在国民党反动派发动第二次反共高潮以后的一九四二年，在皖南事变的血的教训面前，这个老叛徒竟公然要把革命的领导权交给独夫民贼蒋介石，这不是最露骨地交出兵权，交出枪杆子吗？
    发言的同志们愤怒地说：阶级敌人的既定方针是要消灭共产党。而要消灭共产党，最根本的就是要消灭我们党领导的人民武装力量。这是阶级敌人反革命方针的核心。敌人从来没有放弃过这个方针。中国的赫鲁晓夫，肉麻地吹捧独夫民贼为“领袖”，“为旗帜”，实质上就是要取消中国共产党领导的八路军、新四军和革命根据地，唯阶级敌人的“军令、政令”是从，俯首帖耳地去做阶级敌人的“驯服工具”。这也就是配合敌人的方针，帮助敌人去完成其所不能完成的消灭人民武装的反革命事业。这是对人民利益的大出卖，对民族利益的大出卖。毛主席教导我们：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”谁妄想让我们交出武装，我们就和他拚到底！
    以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡
    统一战线，是我们党战胜敌人的三大法宝之一。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫，却在《中国革命的战略与策略问题》这株大毒草中，以偷梁换柱之术，妄图以他的投降主义的统一战线代替毛主席的革命的统一战线。三军无产阶级革命派，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底揭露和批判了他的阴谋诡计。
    发言的同志们首先分析，在抗日战争时期应该建立一个什么样的统一战线？大家认为，必须是毛主席所指示的“全民族的统一战线”，“工农兵学商一切爱国同胞的统一战线”。只有这样真正革命的统一战线，才能“为动员一切力量争取抗战胜利而斗争”。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么国民党是“抗日统一战线最通俗的、合法的组织形式，最好的现成的形式”。这不是明明白白地主张一切都统一到国民党里去吗？这简直比王明的“一切经过统一战线，一切服从统一战线”的投降主义政策更彻底，完全是为蒋介石“限共、溶共、反共”的毒计效劳，妄想让反动派把共产党一口吃掉。这样的统一战线，是道道地地的反革命的统一战线！
    抗日统一战线应该统一于什么？发言的同志指出，必须是毛主席所指示的：“统一于抗战”，“统一于团结”，“统一于进步”。抗战，团结，进步，这三者是当时统一的基础。但中国赫鲁晓夫却完全充当了日本帝国主义和大地主大资产阶级代言人的角色，提出了一套完全与毛主席背道而驰的“统一论”。在他那套谬论里，抗战、团结、进步都不要了，只剩下光秃秃的“统一”。这种“统一”的实质是什么呢？毛主席早已指出，这是“要把共产党、八路军、新四军和民主的抗日根据地消灭，要把一切地方的抗日力量消灭，以便统一于国民党。”这是投降主义的统一论，这是亡国亡党的统一论。
    发言的同志，从统一战线的策略问题上，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的谰言。大家说，毛主席指出：“在抗日统一战线时期中，斗争是团结的手段，团结是斗争的目的。以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡”。以毛主席为代表的革命路线，既要统一，又要独立；既要联合，又要斗争。那就是在统一战线共同纲领的基础上，坚持共产党在统一战线中独立自主的原则，坚持党在思想上、政治上和组织上的独立性。那就是采取发展进步势力，争取中间势力，反对顽固势力的正确政策。但是，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的投降路线，只要统一，不要独立，只要联合，不要斗争。这是要在国民党“一党专政”的旗帜下，达到取消共产党的罪恶目的。这是要在“统一”的幌子下，消灭进步势力，打击中间势力，扩大顽固势力。
    最后，广大指战员就统一战线中谁领导谁的问题，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫。大家指出：在统一战线中，是无产阶级领导资产阶级，还是资产阶级领导无产阶级？这不仅关系到当时抗日民族统一战线能否坚持，抗日战争能否胜利，而且是关系到中国在抗战胜利以后向何处去的问题。无产阶级必须牢牢掌握统一战线的领导权，绝不允许党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把这一领导权出卖。
    抛弃原则性，侈谈“灵活性”，是地地道道的投降主义
    中国赫鲁晓夫在《中国革命的战略与策略问题》这株大毒草中，公然兜售阶级投降主义和民族投降主义的黑货，妄图取消无产阶级在中国革命中的领导权，可是他却厚颜无耻地说，这是“出于当时的策略需要”。
    三军无产阶级革命派齐声质问：这是出于哪个阶级的策略需要？
    指战员们分析了当时的形势，指出当时正是国民党反动派发起第二次反共高潮之后。不仅国民党中大资产阶级的一部分，以汪精卫为代表，早已投降了日本帝国主义，而且大资产阶级的另一部分，以蒋介石为代表，也早已公开了他们消极抗战、积极反共、准备投降的狰狞面目。蒋汪合流活动从未中断，宁渝之间信使往返不绝。蒋介石全力发动反共高潮，日伪军也全力指向解放区。他们三位一体，紧密配合，妄图扼杀坚持抗战的我党我军。面对着这一严重情况，毛主席教导我们：“在国民党反共顽固派坚决地执行其防共、限共、反共政策，并以此为投降日本的准备的时候，我们应强调斗争，不应强调统一，否则就会是绝大的错误。”“任何的人民革命力量如果要避免为蒋介石所消灭，并迫使他承认这种力量的存在，除了对于他的反革命政策作针锋相对的斗争，便无他路可循。”
    但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却公然违抗毛主席的指示，大唱反调。他竟丧心病狂地要把我党我军“统一”到国民党里去，把人民公敌蒋介石作“旗帜”，这充分说明中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“出于当时策略的需要”，就是出于挽救垂死的蒋家王朝的策略需要，就是出于投降日本帝国主义的策略需要。一句话，就是出于大地主阶级、大买办阶级的民族投降主义的策略需要。
    广大指战员们进一步指出，中国赫鲁晓夫还在这株大毒草中，反复鼓吹什么策略上需要有极大的“灵活性”、“实际性”。戳穿他的西洋景，人们清楚地看出，他的这套货色，就是为了灵活地、实际地适应国民党反动派的需要。
    就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在白区工作的时候，为了保全几个叛徒的狗命，打着策略灵活性的幌子，指示共产党员可以在狱中向敌人自首变节，可以在报纸上发表反共启事。就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在抗战胜利后，为了乞求反动政府的一官半职，打着策略灵活性的幌子，妄图出卖人民的政权，人民的军队。就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在全国解放后，为了复辟资本主义，打起策略灵活性的幌子，鼓吹“剥削有功”，命令工人、农民要心甘情愿地去“欢迎”资本家和富农的剥削……。
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫所谓策略上的“灵活性”、“实际性”，就是地地道道的投降主义。这是和马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想所讲的策略灵活性根本相违背的。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想所讲的策略的灵活性，是以原则的坚定性为前提的。中国赫鲁晓夫抛掉了原则的坚定性，来侈谈策略的灵活性，就是机会主义、修正主义，就是适应阶级敌人需要的叛徒理论。
    三军十三个单位的无产阶级革命派，在批判大会上彻底揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫投降、卖国的叛徒嘴脸，一致指出：这个老反革命在《中国革命的战略与策略问题》这株大毒草中，无耻地吹捧人民公敌蒋介石，无耻地吹捧大地主阶级、大资产阶级的政治代表国民党，这完全不是革命的战略和策略，而是修正主义、投降主义的战略和策略；这完全不是无产阶级的战略和策略，而是地主阶级、资产阶级的战略和策略。中国赫鲁晓夫的这套反革命谬论，完全迎合了大地主阶级、大资产阶级妄图从政治上、思想上、组织上取消中国共产党，取消人民的武装力量，扼杀中国革命的需要。公开放弃无产阶级对中国革命的领导权，公开背叛党和人民的利益，公开反对革命、出卖革命，这就是《中国革命的战略与策略问题》这株大毒草的要害，也就是中国赫鲁晓夫四十年来一贯走资本主义道路的假革命、反革命的严重罪行。永远忠于毛主席，誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的三军无产阶级革命派，一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举革命批判的大旗，猛攻中国赫鲁晓夫的要害，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行。三军无产阶级革命派，一定紧握枪杆子，英勇保卫无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底。（附图片）
