Refuting Peng Zhen's "Social Coercion" Theory
Soldier Zhang Lan of a unit of the Beijing Garrison

The great schemer, great conspirator, and counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen, frenziedly attacks the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, disrupting our efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. He dares to say that studying Chairman Mao's works is "social coercion." This is a crime deserving of ten thousand deaths!

Comrade Lin Biao said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country." Mao Zedong Thought is the sunshine and rain for revolutionary soldiers, the steering wheel for our advance towards communism. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have seen the emergence of communist warriors like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Cai Yongxiang; with Mao Zedong Thought, we have cultivated millions of soldiers beloved by the people.

Take me, for example. I am the son of a poor peasant. In the old society, my parents suffered endless exploitation, oppression, and torture from the landlords. Only after liberation did they stand up. When I enlisted, my parents repeatedly instructed me to listen to Chairman Mao, to listen to the Party, to forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, and never to forget the bitter days of the poor in the old society. Upon arriving at the unit, I bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The more I read, the more I loved it, the more I felt Chairman Mao was wise and great, and the more I cherished Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart. The more I read Chairman Mao's books, the more I wanted to revolutionize; the more I wanted to revolutionize, the more I wanted to read Chairman Mao's books. Sometimes I read so much that I forgot to eat and sleep. I wholeheartedly wanted to master Mao Zedong Thought to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen says that studying Chairman Mao's works is "social coercion." This is sheer nonsense. I read Chairman Mao's books and never felt any "coercion," only a strong desire to master Mao Zedong Thought and to carry the proletarian revolution through to the end, so that the proletariat and working people of the whole world can be liberated!

Now, revolutionary people all over the country are studying Chairman Mao's works, and revolutionary people all over the world are also studying Chairman Mao's works. What force makes people all over the country and the world always want to read Chairman Mao's books? The answer is only one: revolutionary people want revolution, therefore they seek truth and study Chairman Mao's works.

Mao Zedong Thought is the source of revolutionary power. Revolutionary people cannot live without Mao Zedong Thought, just as fish cannot live without water and melons cannot grow without vines. Peng Zhen, this schemer, slanders the study of Chairman Mao's works as "social coercion," essentially trying to cut off the revolutionary people's source of revolutionary power, in order to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism. Pah! This is a pipe dream! Peng Zhen opposes our efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, so we must resolutely overthrow him!

　　斥彭真的“社会强迫”论
　　北京卫戍区某部战士　张岚
    大野心家、大阴谋家、反革命修正主义分子彭真，疯狂地攻击战无不胜的毛泽东思想，破坏我们活学活用毛主席著作。他竟胡说什么：学习毛主席著作是“社会强迫”。真是罪该万死！
    林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”毛泽东思想是革命战士成长的阳光雨露，是我们向共产主义前进的方向盘。有了毛泽东思想，才出现了雷锋、王杰、蔡永祥等共产主义战士；有了毛泽东思想，才培养出千百万受人民爱戴的解放军战士。
    就拿我个人来说吧，我是一个贫农的儿子。在旧社会，我的父母受尽了地主的剥削、压迫和折磨，解放后才翻了身。我入伍时，父母再三嘱咐我要听毛主席的话，听党的话，永远跟着毛主席干革命，千万不要忘了旧社会穷人的苦日子。一到部队，我就买了《毛泽东选集》，越读越爱读，越觉得毛主席英明伟大，越从心眼里热爱毛主席。越读毛主席的书，就越要革命；越想革命，也就越要读毛主席的书。有时我读得忘了吃饭，忘了睡觉。我一个心眼地想把毛泽东思想学到手，为中国人民和世界人民服务。反革命修正主义分子彭真胡说学习毛主席著作是“社会强迫”，这真是鬼话。我读毛主席的书，从来没感到什么“强迫”，只是强烈地希望一定要把毛泽东思想学到手，一定要把无产阶级革命进行到底，使全世界无产阶级和劳动人民得到解放！
    现在，全国革命人民都在学习毛主席著作，世界各国革命人民也都在学习毛主席著作。是什么力量使全国人民、全世界人民时时刻刻想读毛主席的书呢？回答只有一个，就是革命人民要革命，因此就要寻求真理，学习毛主席著作。
    毛泽东思想是革命力量的源泉。革命人民离开毛泽东思想，就象鱼儿离了水，瓜儿离了秧，一刻也不能活。彭真这个野心家污蔑学习毛主席著作是
  “社会强迫”，实质上是企图使革命人民断绝革命力量的源泉，好达到他们复辟资本主义的目的。呸！这是妄想！彭真反对我们活学活用毛主席著作，我们就坚决打倒他！
