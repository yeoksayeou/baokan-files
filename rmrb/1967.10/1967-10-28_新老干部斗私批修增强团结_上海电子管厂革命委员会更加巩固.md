Shanghai Electronics Tube Factory's Revolutionary Committee Becomes More Consolidated

The revolutionary representatives and revolutionary cadres of Shanghai Electronics Tube Factory have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. This has further strengthened the relationship between new and old cadres, making the Revolutionary Committee more consolidated and promoting the development of various tasks.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the factory took on the responsibility of leading the revolution and promoting production. However, there were still some misunderstandings between the revolutionary representatives and the revolutionary cadres. These misunderstandings were mainly caused by the bourgeois reactionary line and the "selfishness" in people's minds. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the deception of the Shanghai agents of the Chinese Khrushchev, Chen Pi-hsien and Tsao Chi-chiu, many cadres in this factory implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, attacking the revolutionary masses in the factory, which led to opposition between the revolutionary masses and the cadres. Later, although a series of criticisms and struggles were carried out against the bourgeois reactionary line, and the cadres who implemented it made self-criticisms, some comrades in the revolutionary faction still had grievances against the cadres who had previously attacked them. The cadres who had been integrated had some resentment towards the revolutionary faction for criticizing them in the past and were not enthusiastic about the revolutionary faction. Due to the misunderstandings between the revolutionary representatives and the revolutionary cadres in the Revolutionary Committee, the revolution and production in the factory were also affected to some extent.

At this critical moment, a series of important instructions given by the great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China were issued. The responsible comrades of the revolutionary faction in this factory, through study, deeply realized that it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his Shanghai agents, Chen Pi-hsien and Tsao Chi-chiu, and at the same time eradicate the "selfishness" in their own minds, fundamentally improving the relationship between new and old cadres. They acted swiftly and immediately organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, separately arranging for more than forty middle-level and above cadres and revolutionary faction leaders in the entire factory to study off-site.

At the study classes, the revolutionary faction leaders focused on studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the necessity to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the path of proletarian revolution, which is a key issue for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory, as well as Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." Through the study, they required solving three correct attitudes: correctly treating oneself; correctly treating cadres; correctly treating the masses. They exposed their thoughts, touched their souls, and uprooted their old habits in the study classes, concentrating their hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev and fiercely struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. They comprehensively analyzed the situation of the cadres in the factory, recognizing that the vast majority of the cadres were good, and some of them, after making mistakes, were able to correct them seriously. This is the mainstream of the cadres, so cadres must be treated with enthusiastic help. Through the study, they established three viewpoints: first, to allow cadres to make mistakes and correct mistakes; second, to allow cadres to stand out; third, to welcome cadres' progress.

At the cadre study classes, they focused on studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not rely on old merits, but strive for new achievements." Through the study, they focused on solving the problem of how to correctly treat the revolutionary faction. They reviewed and further saw the great achievements of the revolutionary faction in the Cultural Revolution. They said, the isolation between us and the revolutionary faction in the past was mainly caused by the bourgeois reactionary line, and this account should be settled with the Chinese Khrushchev. At the same time, they also realized that some cadres in the past did not treat the revolutionary faction warmly but coldly observed, unwilling to raise objections, which was their own "selfishness" at work. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Party, if it does not have a large number of new cadres working together with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted. Therefore, all old cadres should enthusiastically welcome new cadres and care for new cadres." They compared themselves with Chairman Mao's instructions, thinking of their long-term cultivation and education by the Party, deeply feeling their responsibility to actively help the revolutionary faction comrades. They thought again about how the revolutionary faction comrades treated the cadres who made mistakes without holding grudges, and enthusiastically helped, and for themselves not actively supporting and helping the revolutionary faction comrades, they felt more ashamed and guilty. In this way, their feelings for the revolutionary faction deepened, their relationship became closer, and they all required themselves to treat the revolutionary faction with eight words: trust, rely on, protect, and help.

After the revolutionary faction and revolutionary cadres studied back-to-back, everyone wanted to talk face-to-face. Therefore, they held a meeting to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. At the meeting, everyone made self-criticisms and fiercely touched their souls. The revolutionary faction criticized the errors of "self-centeredness," "old rebels," and not being able to accept different opinions. The revolutionary cadres also opened their hearts at the meeting, criticizing the errors of "seeking liberation but not integration," "selfishness first," "difficulty first," and not enthusiastically helping the revolutionary faction but coldly observing. The revolutionary workers participating in the meeting said happily: This meeting is great! You all dare to "face the blade," firing at "selfishness" and the bourgeois reactionary line, we are very happy!

Under the leadership of the members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, all workshops and departments in the factory also focused on the relationship between the revolutionary faction and the cadres, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and holding one after another meetings to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Thus, the relationship between the revolutionary faction and the revolutionary cadres throughout the factory changed significantly, gradually forming an atmosphere of mutual learning, mutual concern, mutual support, and mutual help, promoting the development of various tasks.

    新老干部斗私批修增强团结
    上海电子管厂革命委员会更加巩固
    新华社上海二十七日电　上海电子管厂的革命派代表和革命干部，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，进一步密切了新老干部之间的关系，使革命委员会更加巩固，推动了各项工作的开展。
    电子管厂革命委员会成立之后，负起了全厂抓革命、促生产的领导重任，但是，在革命派代表和革命干部之间，还存在一些隔阂。这种隔阂主要是资产阶级反动路线和人们头脑中的“私”字造成的。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，在中国赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋的蒙蔽下，这个厂的许多干部执行了资产阶级反动路线，围攻了厂里的革命群众，造成了革命群众和干部的对立。后来，虽然对资产阶级反动路线进行了一系列的批判、斗争，执行资产阶级反动路线的干部也作了检讨，但革命派有的同志对过去打击过自己的干部，心里还有疙瘩。已经结合了的干部，有的过去受过革命派的批判，心里不舒服，对革命派不够热情。由于革命委员会的革命派代表和革命干部之间存在着隔阂，厂里的革命和生产也受到了一定的影响。
    正在这个时候，伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列重要指示下达了。这个厂的革命派负责人通过学习，深刻地认识到，必须彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋推行的资产阶级反动路线的流毒，同时铲除自己头脑里的“私”字，从根本上改善新老干部之间的关系。他们雷厉风行，立刻举办毛泽东思想学习班，分别组织全厂四十多个中层以上干部和革命派负责人进行脱产学习。
    在学习班上，革命派负责人重点学习了毛主席关于必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题的教导，以及毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》。通过学习，他们要求解决三个正确对待，即：正确对待自己；正确对待干部；正确对待群众。他们在学习班上亮思想，触灵魂，挖老根，把仇恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，狠狠地斗私批修。他们全面分析了厂里干部的情况，认识到厂里绝大多数干部是好的，他们当中有些人犯了错误以后，也是能够认真改正的。这是干部的主流，因此对干部一定要采取热情帮助的态度。通过学习，他们树立了三个观点：第一是要允许干部犯错误，允许干部改正错误；第二是要允许干部站出来；第三是要欢迎干部进步。
    在干部学习班上，他们重点学习了毛主席的教导：不要吃老本，要立新功。通过学习，他们着重解决如何正确对待革命派的问题。他们通过回顾，进一步看清了革命派在文化大革命中的丰功伟绩。他们说，过去我们和革命派之间有隔阂，主要是资产阶级反动路线造成的，这笔账要算到中国赫鲁晓夫身上。同时，他们也认识到，有些干部过去对革命派不是热情相待，而是冷眼旁观，有意见不愿意提，这是自己头脑里的“私”字在作怪。他们还反复学习了毛主席的教导：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。所以一切老干部应该以极大的热忱欢迎新干部，关心新干部。”他们对照毛主席的指示，想想自己经过党的长期培养教育，深深地感到自己有责任主动帮助革命派同志。他们再想想革命派同志对待犯了错误的干部不记私仇，热情帮助，对于自己主动地支持和帮助革命派同志不够，更感到惭愧和内疚。这样，他们对革命派的感情深了，关系亲了，都要求自己对待革命派要做到八个字：相信、依靠、爱护、帮助。
    革命派和革命干部背靠背地学习以后，大家都要求面对面地谈谈心。于是，他们举行了一个活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公的讲用会。会上，大家都作自我批评，狠触自己的灵魂。革命派批判了“以我为主”，以“老造反”自居和听不得不同意见的错误思想。革命干部也在会上交了心，批判了“只求解放，不求结合”，“私”字当头，“难”字领先，以及对革命派不是热情帮助而是冷眼旁观等错误态度。参加讲用会的革命职工看到这种情况，高兴地说：这个会开得太好了！你们大家都敢于“刺刀见红”，向“私”字开火，向资产阶级反动路线开火，我们太高兴了！
    在厂革命委员会成员的带动下，全厂各车间、各部门也围绕着革命派和干部之间的关系问题，活学活用毛主席著作，纷纷召开斗私批修讲用会。于是，全厂从上到下，革命派和革命干部的关系起了显著变化，逐步形成一种相互学习，相互关心，相互支持，相互帮助的团结友爱的气氛，推动了各项工作的开展。
