Liberation Army Launches Heavy Attack in Quang Tri-Thua Thien Region South of Demilitarized Zone, Achieves Splendid Victory of Nearly 4,000 Enemy Casualties in Half a Month

HANOI, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the liberation armed forces active in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region south of the demilitarized zone in South Vietnam have been continuously launching heavy attacks on the enemy since August 28 to September 13, achieving a splendid victory of nearly 4,000 enemy casualties (including 2,700 American soldiers).

Among the enemy casualties, three American companies and three platoons, and two puppet companies and three platoons were completely annihilated, and three puppet companies were severely damaged. The total number of American soldiers killed in half a month was double that of August. In addition, the liberation armed forces also destroyed and damaged 130 enemy vehicles and shot down and destroyed 85 enemy aircraft.

The report said that during this half month, the liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region attacked the heavily guarded enemy strongholds day and night, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

On August 28, the liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region used artillery to simultaneously launch heavy attacks on the important American military bases of Dong Ha, Khe Sanh, and other places, killing hundreds of enemies in one go. In Dong Ha alone, 300 American bandits were killed or wounded.

Following this great victory, the liberation armed forces launched a swift attack on the Phu Bai American airbase and intelligence center at dawn on August 30, killing 500 enemies, most of whom were American officers and technical personnel; destroying 50 enemy aircraft and 40 vehicles, rendering the airbase paralyzed. The next night, the liberation armed forces attacked the airbase and the headquarters of the American Marine Corps again, killing about 100 more American bandits and destroying 10 enemy aircraft.

The People's Daily of Vietnam published an editorial on September 28, enthusiastically hailing the splendid victory of the liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region, achieving nearly 4,000 enemy casualties in half a month. The editorial pointed out that this victory shows that the liberation armed forces have completely taken the initiative in this strategic region south of the demilitarized zone. The editorial said that although the U.S. imperialists suffered a crushing defeat, they are still stubbornly expanding the war of aggression. The liberation armed forces in South Vietnam are determined to give the aggressors even heavier blows until they achieve complete victory.

    南越广治—承天地区解放军在非军事区以南发起猛烈进攻
    战斗半个月取得歼敌近四千名的辉煌战果
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，近几个月来一直活跃在非军事区以南的越南南方广治—承天地区的解放武装力量，从八月二十八日到九月十三日，又连续不断向敌人发起猛烈进攻，取得了歼敌近四千名（美军二千七百名）的辉煌战果。
    在被歼灭的敌人中包括全歼美军三个连和三个排，伪军两个连和三个排；重创伪军三个连。半个月中美军被歼灭的总数比八月份增加了一倍。此外，解放武装力量还击毁击伤敌人军车一百三十辆，击落击毁美机八十五架。
    报道说，在这半个月里，广治—承天地区解放武装力量不分昼夜，接连袭击了由重兵防守的敌人巢穴，给敌人以重大杀伤。
    八月二十八日，广治—承天地区解放武装力量用大炮同时向东河、昆天、育庙和其他美军重要军事基地进行猛烈轰击，一举歼敌数百名。仅东河一地，就有三百个美国强盗被打死打伤。
    继这个巨大胜利之后，解放武装力量在八月三十日凌晨又迅猛地袭击了芙拜美军机场和情报中心，打死了五百名敌人，其中绝大部分是美国军官和技术人员；摧毁敌机五十架和军车四十辆，从而使这个机场陷于瘫痪。第二天晚上，解放武装力量再次袭击这个机场和美国海军陆战师的司令部，又歼灭美国强盗约一百名，击毁敌机十架。
    越南《人民报》九月二十八日发表社论，热烈欢呼广治—承天地区解放武装力量半个月内取得歼敌近四千名的辉煌胜利。社论指出，这个胜利表明，解放武装力量在非军事区以南这个战略地区完全掌握了主动权。社论说，美帝国主义尽管遭到惨败，但是它仍然顽固地不断扩大侵略战争。越南南方解放武装力量决心给予侵略者以更沉重的打击，直到彻底胜利。
