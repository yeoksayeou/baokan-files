	Only by representing the masses can one educate the masses; only by being a student of the masses can one be their teacher. If one regards oneself as the master of the masses, as a nobleman standing above the "lowly people," then no matter how great one's talents, one is not needed by the masses, and one's work has no future.

	From "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"

    毛主席语录
    只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。如果把自己看作群众的主人，看作高踞于“下等人”头上的贵族，那末，不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的。
       《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》
