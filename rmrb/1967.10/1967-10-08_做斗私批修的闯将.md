Our great leader Chairman Mao recently issued a very important directive: to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism.

Chairman Mao's important directive summarizes the entire content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, serving as the guideline to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. It is also the guiding principle for the current wave of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country deepens and develops, the issues of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism become increasingly prominent and acute, standing before every comrade. They serve as the touchstone to test whether every revolutionary fighter of the proletariat can carry the revolution through to the end.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism are two inseparable aspects of uprooting the roots of revisionism and preventing capitalist restoration. Struggling against selfishness is the key to deepening the criticism of revisionism; criticizing revisionism, in turn, will promote the struggle against selfishness. To carry the criticism of revisionism through to the end, we must struggle against selfishness and be brave in carrying out self-revolution. Otherwise, if we do not struggle against the "self" thoroughly, we will not be able to criticize the "revisionism" to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Society is advancing every day, and people's thoughts are being transformed, especially during times of revolutionary upsurge."

Struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism is a matter of great importance for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years. We must take "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline. In the new wave of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, through various forms of study classes, we must help our old cadres, new cadres, and revolutionary youngsters to further study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, become pioneers in criticizing revisionism and models in struggling against selfishness, raise the political consciousness of the proletariat, and achieve new merits for the people.

### 做斗私批修的闯将

    做斗私批修的闯将
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近发出了极其重要的指示：要斗私，批修。
    毛主席的这一重要指示，概括了无产阶级文化大革命的全部内容，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的纲，也是当前掀起革命大批判、革命大联合和革命“三结合”新高潮的指导方针。
    在我国无产阶级专政下的文化大革命更加深入发展的情况下，斗私、批修的问题，越来越突出、越来越尖锐地摆在我们每个同志的面前，成为考验每一个无产阶级革命派战士能不能将革命进行到底的试金石。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场斗私批修的大革命。斗私和批修，是挖掉修正主义毒根、防止资本主义复辟的不可分割的两个方面。斗私，是深入批修的关键；批修，反过来必将促进斗私。要把批修进行到底，就必须斗私，勇于自我革命。否则，不把“私”字斗透，就不可能把“修”字批臭。
    毛主席教导我们说：“社会就是这样地每天在前进，人们的思想在被改造着，特别在革命高涨的时候是这样。”
    斗私、批修，是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。我们一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，在革命的大批判、大联合和“三结合”的新高潮中，通过开办各种学习班的方式，帮助我们的老干部、新干部和革命小将，进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，成为批修的闯将、斗私的模范，提高无产阶级政治觉悟，为人民大立新功。
