U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have staged a so-called "Tibet Treasures Exhibition" to incite anti-China sentiment. Japanese revolutionary people strongly protested against the holding of the anti-China exhibition. Revolutionary people sang Chairman Mao's quotations in the exhibition hall and exposed the reactionaries' anti-China plots.

	NEW DELHI, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, about 100 Japanese revolutionaries and patriotic Chinese residents in Japan on the afternoon of the 5th rushed into the "Tibet Treasures Exhibition" held on the upper floor of the Matsuzakaya Department Store in Tokyo. They strongly protested against the "Yomiuri Shimbun" for holding this exhibition at the behest of U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to incite anti-China sentiment.

	They exposed to the audience, both inside and outside the exhibition hall, the true face of the Dalai Lama, the head of the Tibetan rebels, who betrayed his country and became a lackey of the Indian reactionaries, continuing his anti-China activities. They also demanded that the organizers immediately stop this so-called "Tibet Treasures Exhibition," which serves the sinister anti-China purpose, and expel the rebel Dalai Lama from Japan.

	The Japanese police authorities dispatched more than 100 police officers to the exhibition hall to brutally suppress the revolutionaries and illegally arrested two young people. However, the revolutionaries fearlessly fought back against the police. In the end, the organizers were forced to suspend the exhibition for half a day. Subsequently, a representative of the revolutionaries strongly demanded that the planning director of the Yomiuri Shimbun, Mr. Murakami, immediately expel the rebel Dalai Lama from Japan and stop holding the exhibition. However, Murakami arrogantly rejected the above demands and threatened to continue the exhibition in Osaka and Shizuoka as planned. Therefore, the revolutionaries distributed leaflets in the Matsuzakaya Department Store, exposing their anti-China plots, and revealed to the audience the reactionary and anti-people policies pursued by the Sato government. They shouted slogans: "Expel the rebel Dalai Lama from Japan!" "Immediately stop holding the exhibition!" "Oppose the Sato government's hostile policy towards China!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

	The brave fighters of China and Japan sang Chairman Mao's quotations as they walked from the sixth floor to the first floor of the department store. They tore down the posters of the "Tibet Treasures Exhibition" and smashed the exhibition's billboards. Then they marched and demonstrated on the street, heading to the police station, demanding the immediate release of the two young people who were illegally arrested.

    美日反动派搞起所谓“西藏秘宝展览会”策动反华
    日本革命人民强烈抗议举办反华展览会
    革命人民在会场内高唱毛主席语录歌　揭露反动派反华阴谋
    新华社六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本革命人士和旅日爱国华侨约一百人五日下午涌进设在东京松坂屋百货店楼上的“西藏秘宝展览会”会场内，强烈抗议“读卖新闻社”秉承美日反动派的意旨，举办这个展览会，策动反华。
    他们在会场内外向被骗来参观的观众揭露了西藏叛匪头目达赖背叛祖国，堕落成为印度反动派的走卒，继续进行反华活动的真面目。他们还要求主办人员立即停止这个为阴险的反华目的服务的所谓“西藏秘宝展览会”，并把叛匪达赖赶出日本。
    日本警察当局竟然出动一百多名警察到会场对革命人士进行血腥镇压，并非法地逮捕了二名青年。但是革命人士毫不畏惧地同警察进行了英勇的斗争，最后展览会的主办人员被迫停止展览半天。随后，革命人士的代表强烈要求《读卖新闻》企划部长村上立即把叛匪达赖赶出日本并停止举行展览会，但是村上蛮横地拒绝了上述要求，并且扬言还要按预定计划，在大阪和静冈继续举行这个展览会。于是革命人士在松坂屋百货店散发传单，揭露了他们的反华阴谋，并向观众揭露佐藤反动政府推行反革命、反人民的政策。他们高喊口号：“叛匪达赖滚出日本！”“立即停止举行展览会！”“反对佐藤政府敌视中国的政策！”“日中两国人民战斗的友谊万岁！”
    日中两国英勇的战士们高唱毛主席语录歌从百货店的六楼走到一楼，他们撕毁了“西藏秘宝展览会”的招贴画，砸了展览会的广告牌，然后在街上游行示威，前往警察署，要求立即释放被非法逮捕的二名青年。
