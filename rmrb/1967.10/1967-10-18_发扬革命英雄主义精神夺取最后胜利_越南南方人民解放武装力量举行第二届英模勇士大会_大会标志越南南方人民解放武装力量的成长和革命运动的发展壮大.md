The People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam hold the Second Conference of Heroes and Models

The conference marks the growth of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam and the development and expansion of the revolutionary movement

	Hanoi, October 17 (Xinhua) — According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Second Conference of Heroes and Models of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam was recently held in the liberated areas of South Vietnam.

	The conference unanimously adopted a resolution to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, expressing their determination to fight to the end for the sake of the country and the revolution, to continuously carry forward the tenacious and brave fighting spirit, to overcome all difficulties, to further promote the high tide of decisively defeating the American aggressor bandits, and to achieve brilliant victories together with all the people.

	The Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho, and other leaders such as Chen Nan Zhong, Feng Wen Gong, Nguyen Thi Dinh, and Chen Guo Rong, as well as representatives from various directly affiliated organizations and groups of the National Liberation Front Central Committee, attended the conference.

	Nearly 200 hero and model representatives from various parts of South Vietnam attended the conference. They include the heroic sons and daughters of Quang Tri and Thua Thien who have established brilliant achievements in Yu Zhao, You Ling, Fu Bai, and the 9th Highway, the brave warriors who have made immortal achievements in Ba Jia, Wen Xiang, Bo Lai Mei, and Chan Gang, the heroic warriors who have won a hundred battles in the Eastern Region of the South, the guerrilla fighters who have broken the enemy in the Mekong Delta in Bin Xiu, Qin Qiu, Cha Rong, Shuo Zhuang, and Jin Gu, and the outstanding commanders who have led the troops to gallop on the battlefield and bravely fight the enemy. Outstanding representatives from artillery, engineering, communications, medical, armament, and transportation departments and branches also attended the conference.

	Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, in a warm atmosphere, delivered the opening speech, pointing out that this conference is held at a time when the military and people of South Vietnam have achieved extremely great victories. This conference is a conference of the military and people of South Vietnam who are determined to defeat the American aggressor bandits, marking the growth of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam and an important milestone in the development and expansion of the revolutionary movement in the South. This conference will surely inspire the military and people of South Vietnam to overcome any hardships and sacrifices to achieve complete victory.

	Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho said, the practice on the battlefield shows that the military and people of South Vietnam have never had so many favorable conditions to achieve great victories as they do now. Our initiative has never been so consolidated. Our offensives in all aspects have never been so developed. The possibility of the military and people of South Vietnam defeating the American aggressor army and its puppet army is becoming a clear reality. Even if the U.S. imperialists increase their troops by fifty, sixty, or even more, they will only suffer more severe and disgraceful defeats.

	Chen Guo Rong, Deputy Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, made a report at the conference. He pointed out that after two years of fighting with the American aggressor army, the military and people of South Vietnam have defeated and are defeating more than a million American troops, mercenaries, and puppet troops. The military and people of South Vietnam fight more and more, see more clearly the weaknesses of the American army, see more clearly their own great power, and are more convinced that they will achieve final victory.

	Chen Guo Rong pointed out that the victories achieved in the past two years are the victories of the will to decisively defeat the American bandits, liberate South Vietnam, defend North Vietnam, and ultimately unify the country. This is the victory of the wise political and military line, the victory of the invincible people's war line of the Vietnamese people.

	In his report, Chen Guo Rong analyzed and summarized the new characteristics of the movement to decisively defeat the American bandits in the past two years. He said that the movement to decisively defeat the American bandits in South Vietnam in the past two years, together with the movement to decisively defeat the American aggressor bandits in the North, has made the entire Vietnamese nation more closely united, strengthened the united will of the people of the whole country to decisively defeat the common enemy, the American aggressor bandits.

	Chen Guo Rong talked about Chairman Ho Chi Minh's teaching that "nothing is more precious than independence and freedom," and emphasized that we are determined to advance with the whole country, to strike the enemy more fiercely, and to strive for complete victory.

	Deputy Commander Nguyen Thi Dinh solemnly read out the resolution of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam at the conference, commending 47 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam who have established brilliant achievements in the movement to decisively defeat the American aggressor bandits in the past two years, and awarding them the title of "Hero of the People's Liberation Armed Forces."

	The number of heroes commended at this conference is twice as many as those commended at the first conference of heroes and models. The number of female heroes has also doubled, including one female hero from an ethnic minority.

	Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, Chen Nan Zhong, Feng Wen Gong, and Nguyen Thi Dinh pinned the hero medals on the heroes.

	Chen Nan Zhong, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, spoke at the conference. He stressed that the heroes, models, and brave warriors are the banners that inspire the whole army to forge ahead and are determined to achieve great victories in the coming period. Chen Nan Zhong said, we are determined to defeat the American bandits, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unify the country.

	He said finally, we must raise the banner of revolutionary heroism of this conference higher and let it fly high in every corner of our country, showing the iron will of the Vietnamese nation to decisively defeat the American aggressor bandits.

	Many heroes and models spoke at the conference, expressing their determination and will to decisively defeat the American invaders and their lackeys together with all the military and people.

	The conference adopted a letter to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in which it was stated: "We are determined to redouble our efforts, to be fearless of hardships and sacrifices, for the independence, freedom, and unity of our country, we will resolutely charge forward and achieve more and greater victories in the coming period."

	The letter adopted by the conference to the heroic people of North Vietnam expressed deep gratitude to the rear base and assured the people of North Vietnam: The People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam are determined to defeat the American bandits, liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country.

	The letter adopted by the conference to the military and people of the South called on all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam to raise the banner of decisively defeating the American bandits higher, to advance bravely, and to achieve greater victories.

    他最后说，必须更高地举起大会的革命英雄主义旗帜，让它在我们祖国各地高高飘扬，显示越南民族坚决战胜美国侵略强盗的钢铁意志。
