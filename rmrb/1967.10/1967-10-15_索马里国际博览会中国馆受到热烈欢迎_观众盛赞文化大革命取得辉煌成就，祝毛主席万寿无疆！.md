The Chinese Pavilion at the Somali International Expo Receives Warm Welcome

Audiences Praise the Resounding Achievements of the Cultural Revolution, Wishing Chairman Mao Eternal Life!

According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, October 13th: The Somali International Expo was held from September 28th to October 12th in Mogadishu.

Many Somalis visited the Chinese Pavilion at this expo and highly praised the resounding achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially during the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the opening ceremony of the expo, Somali Republic President Sharmarke, Speaker of the National Assembly Hussein, and Prime Minister Egal, accompanied by Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Somalia Zheng Peitang and the Director of the Chinese Pavilion Li Si, visited the Chinese Pavilion.

On the 12th, during the closing ceremony, when the Director of the Chinese Exhibition Pavilion Li Si went on stage to receive the commemorative items from the expo, the entire audience erupted in enthusiastic cheers, passionately shouting, "China, Mao Zedong!" "China, Mao Zedong!" However, when the American representative appeared, the crowd booed loudly.

At the beginning of the closing ceremony, about two thousand Somali people gathered in front of the Chinese Exhibition Pavilion. The entire staff of the Chinese Pavilion stood at the entrance, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and shouting, "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with all reactionaries! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" At this time, Somali friends also shouted in Chinese and Somali, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" When the ceremony ended, the Somali crowd applauded warmly, congratulating the successful completion of the Chinese Pavilion at the Somali International Expo and wishing for further strengthening of the friendship between the Chinese and Somali peoples.

During the two weeks since the opening of the expo, the Chinese Pavilion, which reflects the spiritual face of the Chinese people during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and embodies the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, attracted a large number of audiences every night.

Many visitors wrote in the guestbook to enthusiastically praise the Chinese Pavilion. They attributed the great achievements reflected in the Chinese Pavilion to the great Mao Zedong Thought and wished Chairman Mao eternal life.

One visitor wrote: "This is a great opportunity for us to understand the new world created by the great leader Chairman Mao and to know how the Chinese people have made such progress in such a short time. Long live China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Somali peoples!"

One audience member wrote: "The Chinese Pavilion is the best pavilion at this expo. I believe that all these achievements are due to the adherence to Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong is the greatest leader, the greatest teacher, the greatest commander, and the greatest helmsman of our time. Long live the great leader Mao Zedong!"

Another audience member said: "No matter how much the imperialists and modern revisionists hate China and its great leader, we oppressed peoples believe that Chairman Mao is the true leader of the oppressed peoples, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. China's explosion of its first hydrogen bomb is a great joy. This is also a victory for the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression and for freedom. The American aggressors will be defeated! Long live the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time!"

　　索马里国际博览会中国馆受到热烈欢迎
　　观众盛赞文化大革命取得辉煌成就，祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    据新华社摩加迪沙十三日电　索马里国际博览会从九月二十八日到十月十二日在这里举行。
    许多索马里人参观了这个博览会的中国馆，并且高度赞扬在毛主席领导下的中国人民自从中华人民共和国成立以来，特别是在目前的无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的辉煌成就。
    博览会开幕式举行后，索马里共和国总统舍马克、国民议会议长侯赛因和总理埃加勒，在中国驻索马里大使馆临时代办郑佩堂和中国馆馆长李斯的陪同下，参观了中国馆。
    在十二日的闭幕仪式上，当中国展览馆馆长李斯上台接受博览会发给的纪念品时，全场观众发出热烈的欢呼声，热情高呼：“中国，毛泽东！”“中国，毛泽东！”而当美国代表出现时，人们就发出强烈的“嘘！嘘！”声。
    在闭幕式开始时，约有两千名索马里群众聚集在中国展览馆前。中国馆的全体工作人员在中国馆门口，齐声朗读毛主席语录，高呼“打倒美帝国主义！打倒苏联现代修正主义！打倒各国反动派！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁，万万岁！”这时，索马里朋友也用中国话和索马里话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”仪式结束时，索马里群众热烈鼓掌，祝贺索马里国际博览会中国馆圆满成功，祝贺中国人民和索马里人民的友谊进一步加强。
    在博览会开幕以来的两星期里，反映中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中的精神面貌和体现光辉的毛泽东思想的中国馆每晚都吸引了广大观众。
    许多参观者在留言簿上热烈赞扬中国馆。他们把中国馆中所反映出来的伟大成就归功于伟大的毛泽东思想，并祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。
    一位参观者写道：“这是一个大好机会使我们了解了伟大领袖毛泽东主席缔造的一个新世界，知道了中国人民是怎样在这样短的时间里取得这样的进展的。中国万岁！伟大领袖毛主席万岁！索中两国人民友好万岁！”
    一位观众写道：“中国馆是本届博览会中最好的馆。我认为，这一切成就，完全是因为遵循毛泽东思想的缘故。毛泽东是当代最伟大的领袖、伟大的导师、伟大的统帅和伟大的舵手。伟大的领袖毛泽东万岁！”
    另一位观众说：“不管帝国主义者和现代修正主义者如何痛恨中国和她的伟大领袖，我们被压迫人民都认为，毛泽东主席是被压迫人民的真正的领袖，是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。中国爆炸了自己的第一颗氢弹，这是空前的大喜事。这也是正在为反对美帝侵略和争取自由而斗争的越南人民的胜利。美国侵略者必败！当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者万岁！”
