	Today, the center of Shanghai, People's Square, is filled with red flags.

Giant banners around the square read: "The Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people in their struggle to fight the Americans and save the nation to the end!" "Down with imperialism led by the United States! Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Warmly celebrate the great victories of the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam in their struggle to fight the Americans and save the nation!"

	Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee officials, including Liao Zhengguo, Wang Shaoyong, Mei Jiasheng, and Zheng Changhua, as well as representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations, attended the meeting. Vietnamese students and trainees in Shanghai were also invited to attend the meeting.

	Liao Zhengguo spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically praising the glorious victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle to fight the Americans and save the nation.

	Liao Zhengguo pointed out: The people of Shanghai, like the people of the entire country, will, regardless of wind or rain, continue to follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "firmly support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam," and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in their struggle to the end, until they drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory.

	Huang Wendan spoke amid enthusiastic applause. He enthusiastically praised the Chinese people, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, for their efforts to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, self-reliance, and striving for strength and bravery.

	Huang Wendan, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the fraternal combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam and sincerely thanked the Chinese people for their support to the Vietnamese people. He said that the people of South Vietnam highly value the sincere support of the Chinese people and regard it as a great encouragement to their struggle to fight the Americans and save the nation.

	Nguyen Thanh Quang, who has been awarded the title of outstanding anti-American hero three times, and the female hero Nguyen Thi Tuyet, who is only seventeen and a half years old and has already killed twenty-five American aggressors, were invited to the meeting to share their heroic stories of fighting and killing a large number of American invaders in South Vietnam.

	The speeches by Liao Zhengguo and Huang Wendan, as well as the introduction of the combat achievements of Nguyen Thanh Quang and Nguyen Thi Tuyet, repeatedly sparked thunderous applause from the entire audience.

	After the speeches, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee presented a banner to the delegation.
