The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, whether it is to support or oppose, to love or to hate, is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have always fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought. They have directed a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the educational field to vigorously oppose the revolutionary teachers' movement to study, apply, and use Chairman Mao's works. The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen within the former Beijing Municipal Committee, in collusion with a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists from the former Ministry of Higher Education and the former Propaganda Department, have strenuously suppressed the entry of Chairman Mao's quotations into the classroom in our school, which is an ironclad evidence of their counter-revolutionary activities.

In December 1963, our great leader Chairman Mao called on the entire nation to learn from the People's Liberation Army. In 1964, Chairman Mao further instructed that schools should also learn from the People's Liberation Army. The broad revolutionary teachers and students in our school, like the people of the entire nation, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and launched a wave of "universities learning from the army." Students flocked to join the army, and teachers went to advanced military academies to study and visit. Through these activities, the most fundamental lesson everyone learned was that they must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything.

To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary teachers and students followed the teachings of Comrade Lin Biao, repeatedly studying the "Three Articles" as well as the great works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," extracting key sentences for repeated study and application, transforming their thoughts and improving teaching methods. In the second half of 1964, some teachers began using Chairman Mao's quotations to guide teaching in the classroom, achieving immediate results. The spiritual outlook of the broad teachers and students underwent tremendous changes.

Great Mao Zedong Thought guided us to powerfully strike down the influence of Confucius, Dewey, Kappelov, and others in the schools over many years, causing unprecedented changes in the entire teaching content and methods. For example, in the drawing course, when drawing assembly diagrams, using Chairman Mao's teaching, "Battles must be fought one by one, and enemies must be eliminated one by one," the assembly was broken down into several individual components, greatly simplifying complex problems and enabling students to quickly grasp the drawing techniques. The "Molding Materials" course in the casting major had previously copied Soviet revisionist textbooks, severely deviating from production practices, being both tedious and mysterious, making it very difficult for students to learn. After studying Chairman Mao's works, the teachers immersed themselves in production practice, obtaining a large amount of firsthand materials, breaking away from old frameworks, and reforming the teaching content. At the same time, the teachers moved the classroom to the workshop, combining lectures with practice, and closely cooperating with workers and technical personnel to guide students in "practice, cognition, further practice, and further cognition." As a result, not only was the teaching time for this course greatly reduced, and the students' ability to analyze and solve practical problems improved, but production problems were also solved. After a period of study and practice, more and more people tasted the sweetness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the teaching process and production practice, the broad revolutionary teachers and students generally consciously sought solutions to problems from Chairman Mao's works when encountering issues. Everyone deeply felt that Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand, with the highest level and greatest power.

By early 1965, the broad revolutionary teachers and students in our school had reached an unprecedented high tide in using Chairman Mao's quotations in teaching. The classrooms, research rooms, factories, forges, machine tools, and toolboxes all shone with the golden light of Chairman Mao's quotations. The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the entire Beijing Institute of Mechanical Engineering.

The news of our school's Chairman Mao's quotations entering the classroom quickly attracted the widespread attention of sister schools. Comrades from sister schools in Beijing, Tianjin, and Harbin came to visit and observe, giving us great support and encouragement. The flames of educational revolution in our school burned more fiercely.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen within the former Beijing Municipal Committee and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists from the former Ministry of Higher Education and the former Propaganda Department were terrified and hated our school's revolutionary action of bringing Chairman Mao's quotations into the classroom. They colluded to launch a frenzied counter-revolutionary suppression against our revolutionary masses.

In February 1965, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists from the former Beijing Municipal Committee and the former Ministry of Higher Education sent an "investigation team" to our school, specifically collecting so-called "formalistic" examples. They maliciously attacked our school's use of Chairman Mao's quotations in teaching as "labeling" and "vulgarization," and declared, "This way is not acceptable," and "to control the chaotic introduction of experiences."

In March of the same year, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique within the former Beijing Municipal Committee issued a "bulletin," which did not mention the significant meaning and achievements of our use of Chairman Mao's quotations but instead slandered us as having a "mission-oriented approach," "misinterpreting," and most of it being "inserted," "patched," and "stitched" together, and so on.

As soon as this bulletin was released, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the educational field circulated it to colleges and universities and cultural departments across the country. In just a few months, the former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Ministry of Higher Education, and other departments issued five "bulletins," specifically attacking our school's use of Chairman Mao's quotations. Their intentions were extremely malicious!

This group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, in order to thoroughly suppress our study and use of Chairman Mao's quotations, also used organizational means, directing the Ministry of Machinery's capitalist-roaders within the Party to send people to our school to suppress us. They said things like, "Studying Chairman Mao's works 'should be based on specific circumstances, not using a few quotations in every class, this is dogmatism.'" And ordered us: "Follow the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee, listen more to the Municipal Committee's Higher Education Department and the Ministry of Higher Education."

The capitalist-roaders within the Party in our school, following their masters, sang in unison, step by step, and decided that "we will no longer mention the use of Chairman Mao's quotations." It was extremely malicious!

Facing the enemy's rampant attacks, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and revolutionary cadres in our school carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "rebellion is justified," fearing no violence, and continued to insist on using Chairman Mao's quotations without interruption until the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The more the enemy did not allow us to use them, the more we insisted on using them. Not only did we read them in the classroom, but we also printed them in lecture notes and copied them into notebooks, reading and using them every day. We never forgot Chairman Mao's teachings, keeping Chairman Mao's instructions in our hearts and implementing them in our actions. We not only used them in lectures within the school but also, despite the risks of counter-revolutionary suppression, brought Chairman Mao's quotations to the classrooms of other schools when giving lectures outside. Some teachers exchanged experiences of bringing Chairman Mao's quotations into the classroom with sister schools and faced opposition from a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the former Municipal Committee, engaging in face-to-face struggles with them. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," breaking through numerous obstacles, defending the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and giving a powerful response to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party!

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, we proletarian revolutionaries have exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively respond to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be heroes in fighting selfishness, and pioneers in criticizing revisionism, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, completely overthrowing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly smashing the feudal and capitalist educational system, and turning our school into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

　　让毛泽东思想统帅一切改造一切
　　北京机械学院　东方红公社
    对待毛泽东思想采取什么态度，是拥护还是反对，是热爱还是敌视，这是革命和反革命，马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分水岭。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一贯疯狂地反对毛泽东思想。他们在教育界指使一小撮反革命修正主义分子，极力反对革命师生活学活用毛主席著作。旧北京市委内以彭真为首的反革命修正主义集团，伙同旧高教部、旧中宣部一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在我院极力扼杀毛主席语录进课堂，就是他们进行反革命活动的一个铁证。
    一九六三年十二月，我们伟大的领袖毛主席号召全国都要学解放军。一九六四年，毛主席又指示学校也要学解放军。我院广大革命师生和全国人民一样，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，掀起了一个大学解放军的热潮。学生纷纷下连队当兵，教师纷纷前往解放军先进院校学习、访问。通过这些活动，大家学到的最根本的一条，就是必须活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去统帅一切、推动一切和改造一切。
    为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，广大革命师生遵循林彪同志的教导，反复学习
  “老三篇”以及《实践论》、《矛盾论》等伟大著作，把一些警句摘录下来，反复学习，反复运用，改造思想，改进教学。一九六四年下半年，有一部分教师就开始在课堂上运用毛主席语录指导教学，并收到立竿见影的效果，广大师生的精神面貌起了巨大的变化。
    伟大的毛泽东思想引导我们有力地冲击了多少年来孔夫子、杜威、凯洛夫等在学校里的影响，使整个教学内容和教学方法发生空前未有的变化。例如：制图课在画组合体图形时，运用毛主席“打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭”的教导，将组合体解剖成若干单元体，大大简化了复杂的问题，使学生很快就掌握了画图要领。铸造专业“造型材料”这门课程，过去的教学内容完全抄袭苏修教材，严重脱离生产实际，既烦琐，又故弄玄虚，学生在学习时非常吃力。教师们学习了毛主席著作以后，即投身到生产实践中去，取得了大量第一手材料，打破了旧的框框，把教学内容进行了改革。同时，教师还把课堂搬到车间，实行讲练结合，并与工人和技术人员密切合作，指导学生进行“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”。结果不仅大大地压缩了这门课程的教学时数，提高了同学分析、解决实际问题的能力，而且解决了生产中的一些问题。经过一段时间的学习和实践，越来越多的人尝到了活学活用毛主席著作的甜头。广大革命师生在教学过程中，在生产实践中，遇到问题时，一般都能自觉地从毛主席著作中，寻找解决问题的立场、观点和方法。大家深深地体会到：毛主席的话句句是真理，一句顶一万句，水平最高，威力最大。
    到了一九六五年初，我院广大革命师生在教学中活学活用毛主席语录出现了空前未有的高潮。教室、教研室、工厂里，锻锤边，机床旁，工具箱上，毛主席语录处处闪金光。毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了整个北京机械学院。
    我院毛主席语录进课堂的喜讯，很快地引起了各兄弟院校的广泛重视。北京、天津和哈尔滨等地兄弟院校的同志纷纷来访问观摩，给了我们很大的支持和鼓舞。我院教育革命的烈火，越烧越旺。
    旧北京市委内以彭真为首的反革命修正主义集团和旧高教部、旧中宣部一小撮反革命修正主义分子，对我院毛主席语录进课堂的革命行动，怕得要死，恨之入骨。他们串通一气，对我院革命群众进行了疯狂的反革命围剿。
    一九六五年二月，旧北京市委和旧高教部一小撮反革命修正主义分子，派出“调查组”来我院，专门搜集所谓“形式主义”的例子。他们恶毒地攻击我院运用毛主席语录进行教学是“贴标签”、“庸俗化”，并扬言：“这样做不行”，“要控制乱介绍经验”。
    同年三月，旧北京市委内反革命修正主义集团出了一期“简报”，其中绝口不谈我们运用毛主席语录的重大意义和成绩，却胡说我们是“任务观点”，“乱加解释”，多数是“加塞”、“镶缝”、“拼凑”式的运用，等等。
    这期“简报”一出笼，教育界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子又把它通报到全国各高等院校和文教部门。仅在短短的几个月中，旧北京市委、旧高教部等部门就出了五份“通报”，专门攻击我院运用毛主席语录。其用心何其毒也！
    这伙反革命修正主义分子，为了彻底扼杀我们学习和运用毛主席语录，还采用组织手段，指使一机部党内走资本主义道路当权派派人来我院镇压。他们胡说什么，学习毛主席著作“要根据具体情况，不要每堂课都用几条语录，这是教条主义”。并命令我们：“按北京市委的指示办事，多听市委大学部和高教部的。”
    我院党内走资本主义道路的当权派，尾随其主子，一唱一和，亦步亦趋，竟然决定今后“不再提运用毛主席语录”。真是恶毒之极！
    面对阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，我院广大革命师生和革命干部，发扬了“造反有理”的革命精神，不畏强暴，继续坚持运用毛主席语录，直到无产阶级文化大革命开始从未间断。敌人越是不让我们用，我们就越是要用。不仅在课堂上读，而且还印在讲义里，抄在笔记中，天天读，天天用。我们时刻不忘毛主席的教导，把毛主席的指示牢记在心坎里，落实在行动上。我们不仅在校内讲课用，而且在去外校讲课时，冒着反革命围剿的风险，把毛主席语录带到外校的课堂里去。有的教师与兄弟院校交流毛主席语录进课堂的经验，遭到旧市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的反对，就与他们展开了面对面的斗争。我们按照毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，冲破重重阻力，捍卫光焰无际的毛泽东思想，给党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以有力的回击！
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来了！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极响应毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，作斗私的英雄，当批修的闯将，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭，彻底摧毁封建主义和资本主义的教育制度，把我们学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
