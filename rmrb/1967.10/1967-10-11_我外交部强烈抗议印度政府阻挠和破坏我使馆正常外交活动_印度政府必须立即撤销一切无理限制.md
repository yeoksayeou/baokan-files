The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests the Indian government's obstruction and sabotage of normal diplomatic activities of our embassy. The Indian government must immediately revoke all unreasonable restrictions.

	NEW DELHI, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the increasingly frenzied anti-China Indian reactionary government has recently taken a series of restrictive measures against the Chinese Embassy in India, obstructing and sabotaging the normal diplomatic activities of the Chinese Embassy. This is a blatant violation of the most basic international norms and a serious step to further damage bilateral relations. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the Indian Embassy in China and demanded that the Indian side immediately revoke all unreasonable restrictions.

	On June 13, the Indian reactionary government arbitrarily restricted the movement of Chinese Embassy personnel outside the jurisdiction of the New Delhi Municipal Council. This is a blatant provocation against the Chinese Embassy.

	On September 7, the Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires Chen Zhaoyuan and his party were preparing to travel from New Delhi to Calcutta on official business. The Indian reactionary government, however, arbitrarily obstructed them and ordered the travel agency not to sell them airplane tickets. On September 8, the Chinese Embassy purchased train tickets to Calcutta. On September 10, the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent an urgent note to the Chinese Embassy, further arbitrarily restricting the movement of Embassy personnel beyond the restrictions imposed on June 13. They even prohibited Embassy personnel from going to any train station within the New Delhi municipal area. Starting from September 10, the Indian reactionary government deployed more spies and police at the gates of the Chinese Embassy, closely monitoring and following Embassy personnel.

	On September 20, the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent another note to the Chinese Embassy, proposing new restrictive measures. It demanded that the Chinese Embassy submit the names and detailed addresses of all invitees one week in advance for any invitations issued. It also stipulated that businesspeople and other individuals who have official dealings with the Chinese Embassy must obtain a pass from the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, spies sent by the Indian reactionary government closely guarded the Chinese Embassy day and night, interrogating and obstructing those who attempted to enter the Embassy. They brazenly disrupted the normal conduct of the Chinese Embassy's National Day reception.

	The Indian reactionary government's blatant deprivation of the rights of Chinese diplomatic representatives to perform their duties is a complete violation of international norms. When the Chinese Embassy lodged a serious protest with Indian Foreign Ministry officials, the Indian authorities defended themselves by claiming that this was based on the principle of "reciprocity," saying that the Chinese government had also imposed "restrictions" on the Indian Embassy in China. This is a complete fabrication. The Indian Embassy in China has always enjoyed the same treatment as all other foreign missions in Beijing, and the Chinese government has not taken any discriminatory measures against it. However, the Indian government's series of restrictive measures are specifically targeted at the Chinese Embassy, which is a thorough act of hostility and harassment, and has nothing to do with "reciprocity."

	After its deceitful arguments were exposed, the Indian authorities came up with the excuse of "protecting the safety of Chinese Embassy personnel." This is also nonsense. On June 16, a large mob stormed the Chinese Embassy, injuring many Embassy staff members. This was a plot orchestrated by the Indian reactionary government. The disruption of the Chinese Embassy's National Day reception, and even the beating of Indian friends attending the reception, was also done by the Indian government. It is precisely because the Indian reactionary government, following the dictates of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has been frenziedly anti-China and creating bloody incidents that the safety of Chinese Embassy personnel has been threatened. Now, the Indian reactionary government uses the excuse of "protecting safety" to restrict and deprive Chinese diplomatic personnel of their right to perform their duties, which is extremely absurd. The Indian reactionary government's obstinate actions in violating international norms will certainly not escape the stern condemnation of the Indian and world peoples.

### 我外交部强烈抗议印度政府阻挠和破坏我使馆正常外交活动　印度政府必须立即撤销一切无理限制

　　我外交部强烈抗议印度政府阻挠和破坏我使馆正常外交活动
　　印度政府必须立即撤销一切无理限制
    新华社五日讯　新德里消息：在美帝和苏修指使下日益疯狂反华的印度反动政府，最近接二连三地对中国驻印度大使馆采取种种限制措施，阻挠和破坏中国大使馆正常的外交活动。这是印度反动政府粗暴地破坏最起码的国际关系准则，进一步破坏两国关系的严重步骤。中国外交部已经向印度驻华大使馆提出抗议，并且要求印方立即撤销一切无理限制。
    印度反动政府在六月十三日无理限制中国大使馆人员离开新老德里市政当局管辖的范围。这完全是对中国大使馆的挑衅。
    九月七日，中国大使馆临时代办陈肇源一行准备从新德里去加尔各答执行公务。印度反动政府却横蛮地加以阻挠，下令旅行社不售予飞机票。九月八日，中国大使馆购得前往加尔各答的火车票。十日，印度外交部竟然把一件紧急照会送给中国大使馆，在六月十三日的限制措施以外，进一步蛮横地限制大使馆人员的行动，连德里市政范围以内的任何火车站，也不让去。从九月十日起，印度反动政府就在中国大使馆门口增派特务、警察，严密监视。并对使馆人员跟踪监视。
    九月二十日，印度外交部又照会中国大使馆，进一步提出新的限制措施，竟然要中国大使馆的一切邀请，必须在邀请前一个星期向印度外交部提交受邀者名单一式四份和他们的详细地址。它还规定同中国大使馆有事务来往的商人和其他人员，必须向印度外交部取得通行证。与此同时，印度反动政府派遣的特务在中国大使馆附近严密看守，日夜轮班，盘问和阻挠要求进入大使馆的人。蛮横地破坏中国大使馆的国庆招待会的正常进行。
    印度反动政府这样明目张胆地剥夺中国外交代表履行职责的权利，完全是违反国际关系准则的。当中国大使馆向印度外交部官员提出严重抗议时，印度当局狡辩说这是根据“对等”原则，说中国政府对印度驻华大使馆也采取了“限制”措施。这完全是捏造。印度驻华大使馆一向享有北京所有外国使团享有的同样待遇，中国政府对它没有采取任何歧视性措施。但是，印度政府接二连三地采取的限制措施却是专门针对中国大使馆的，这是彻头彻尾的敌视和刁难，根本不是什么“对等”。
    印度当局在它的诡辩被揭穿以后，又拿出所谓“保护中国大使馆人员的安全”作为借口。这也是胡说。六月十六日大批暴徒冲入中国大使馆，打伤使馆工作人员多人，这是印度反动政府一手策划的。破坏中国大使馆的国庆招待会，甚至毒打参加招待会的印度朋友，也是印度政府亲自干的。正是印度反动政府按照美帝苏修的意旨疯狂反华，制造血腥事件，中国大使馆人员的安全才受到威胁。现在印度反动政府还拿什么“保护安全”为借口限制和剥夺中国外交人员执行公务的权利，是极端荒谬的。印度反动政府这样一意孤行，破坏国际关系准则，绝对逃脱不了印度和世界人民的严正谴责。
