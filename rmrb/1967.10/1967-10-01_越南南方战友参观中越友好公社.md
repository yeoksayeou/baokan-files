A delegation from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, coming from the frontlines of the anti-American struggle, visited the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune today with great excitement. They were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses of the commune.

Members of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune wrote large banners in the commune's courtyard, such as "Heartily congratulate the great victories of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation!" and "Seven hundred million Chinese people pledge to be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people!" to welcome their comrades.

When the delegation led by Huang Wendan and all the members arrived at the commune, hundreds of commune members and Red Guards, holding high portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Hu, and portraits of Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, banged drums and gongs, lining the streets to welcome the Vietnamese comrades from the South.

The commune's leaders introduced to the guests the all-around bumper harvest achieved by the commune under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Huang Wendan, the delegation leader, and the 18-year-old heroine who shot down American planes, Vu Thi Tuyet, visited the poor peasant member Van Phu Thi.

The heroine Vu Thi Tuyet and Ly Chi Yuen shared their heroic deeds of fighting against American aggressors at the welcoming ceremony.

Huang Wendan, the delegation leader, praised the Chinese people for actively responding to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "be prepared for war, be prepared for famine, and serve the people," working hard and producing actively, and actively supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

The Vietnamese comrades also visited the commune's cattle farm, pig farm, and horse farm.
