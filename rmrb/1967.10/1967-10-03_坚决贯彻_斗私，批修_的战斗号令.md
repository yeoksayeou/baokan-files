Songs echo through the sky, and victory reports come frequently. The billion people of the nation are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, and enthusiastically acclaiming the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On this glorious day, our deputy commander, Comrade Lin Biao, conveyed the latest battle call issued by our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao: "Criticize self, oppose revisionism." We Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive, carrying it out one thousand times, ten thousand times.

The fundamental task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is not only to thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, along with the various revisionist fallacies they peddle, but also to struggle against the "self" in our own minds, seize the power of the "self," transform people's souls, and promote the revolutionization of thought. We must establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions.

Criticizing self and opposing revisionism are interconnected. Only by criticizing self can we overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, establish proletarian party spirit, and thus carry out the criticism of revisionism. Only by criticizing self can we use the proletarian worldview to defeat the bourgeois worldview. The courage to criticize self is the touchstone for distinguishing true proletarian revolutionaries from false ones. We must use the criticism of self to ensure the criticism of revisionism, and use the criticism of revisionism to promote the criticism of self, to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The most powerful weapon for "criticizing self and opposing revisionism" is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Through more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the biggest handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, along with their agents in Shanghai, have been exposed. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply penetrated people's hearts, and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought has been established. This is the most magnificent achievement and a great contribution to the international communist movement. Recall last year's National Day, when the Khrushchev in China and his agents in Shanghai were still arrogant and overbearing. Yet, in the blink of an eye, these seemingly powerful figures have all been pulled down from their horses and knocked to the ground by us proletarian revolutionaries in the revolutionary storm.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and with the support of the People's Liberation Army, the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries have established a revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organ, firmly grasping the reins of proletarian dictatorship in our own hands, creating a thriving new situation, and achieving new victories in "grasp revolution, promote production"!

In the course of this great struggle that shakes the world, we proletarian revolutionaries have also been greatly tempered and strengthened in thought and organization. This is a remarkable achievement.

The helmsman guides the ship across the sea, the sun nurtures all living things, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. There are countless achievements, but the most fundamental and important one is that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized across the nation, and the political consciousness of our revolutionary people has reached an unprecedented height. We Shanghai workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to change the world includes the following tasks: changing the objective world and also changing one's subjective world," and following Vice Chairman Lin's directive to "regard oneself as a force for revolution and at the same time constantly regard oneself as the object of revolution," have, while fighting against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, also fiercely criticized the "self" in our minds, carried out a revolution in our souls, and launched a mass movement to thoroughly study Chairman Mao's works with the spirit of rectification. Various units have universally established classes for studying Chairman Mao's works, and many grassroots organizations have gradually formed the good practice of studying Chairman Mao's works every day, eagerly learning as if starving. Many comrades learn and then put into practice, resolutely implementing in action, striving to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and thus be able to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, eliminate influences from both the "left" and the "right," and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected Shanghai, which is our greatest happiness and greatest honor. We workers most listen to Chairman Mao's words; whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it. Based on Chairman Mao's latest directive, we have swiftly launched a new high tide of great unity. The proletarian revolutionaries in the ten districts under the Workers' General Headquarters have all achieved great unity. Revolutionary criticism, revolutionary three-in-one combination, struggle-criticism-transformation within the unit, and "grasp revolution, promote production" have all seen new leaps. This is the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's latest directive and the result of thoroughly studying Chairman Mao's works.

Open our eyes to the future and march forward steadfastly. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to further raise our political consciousness, resolutely "criticize self and oppose revisionism," thoroughly eliminate petty-bourgeois factionalism, smash the "self," and establish the "public," achieving the revolutionization of thought. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, ride the east wind of the great revolutionary situation, and advance with high spirits.

    坚决贯彻“斗私，批修”的战斗号令
　　上海工人革命造反总司令部　王洪文
    歌声震天，捷报频传。全国亿万人民满怀革命激情，庆祝伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年，热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命取得的辉煌胜利。就在这个光辉节日里，我们的副统帅林彪同志，传达了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出的“斗私，批修”的最新战斗号令。我们上海无产阶级革命派的工人同志们，坚决贯彻毛主席的这一伟大指示，一千个照办，一万个照办。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的根本任务，就是不仅要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派连同他们所贩卖的种种修正主义谬论批深批透、批倒批臭，而且要同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，夺“私”字的权，改造人的灵魂，促进思想革命化。我们要树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    斗私和批修是互相联系的。只有斗私，才能克服小资产阶级的派性，树立无产阶级的党性，从而搞好批修。只有斗私，才能用无产阶级世界观战胜资产阶级世界观。敢不敢斗私，是鉴别真假无产阶级革命派的试金石。我们一定要用斗私来保证批修，用批修来推动斗私，以夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
      “斗私，批修”的最锐利武器，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    经过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人被揪出来了，毛主席的革命路线深入人心，毛泽东思想的绝对权威已经树立起来，这是最最伟大的成绩，是对国际共产主义运动的巨大贡献。回想去年国庆节时，中国的赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人还得意洋洋，不可一世。可是，曾几何时，这些貌似强大的家伙，在革命的风暴中统统被我们无产阶级革命派拉下了马，打翻在地。
    上海的无产阶级革命派在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在中国人民解放军支持下，建立了革命的三结合的临时权力机构，把无产阶级专政的印把子牢牢地掌握在自己的手里，创造了欣欣向荣的新局面，取得了“抓革命，促生产”的新胜利！
    在进行这场翻天覆地的伟大斗争的同时，也在思想上和组织上极
  大地锻炼和壮大了我们无产阶级革命派，这是一个很了不起的成就。
      大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。成绩千条万条，最根本、最重要的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全国范围内得到最大的普及，我国革命人民的政治觉悟得到空前提高。我们上海工人阶级，遵循毛主席“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界”的教导，遵循林副主席“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”的指示，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的同时，也狠斗自己头脑中的私字，在灵魂深处闹革命，掀起了以整风精神大学毛主席著作的群众运动。各单位普遍开办了毛主席著作学习班，许多基层组织都逐步形成了天天读毛主席著作的良好风气，如饥似渴地学习。许多同志学了就用，在行动中坚决贯彻，努力克服小资产阶级的派性，加强无产阶级的党性，从而使自己能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，排除来自“左”、右两方面的影响，牢牢地掌握了斗争大方向。
    最近，我们伟大领袖毛主席视察了上海，这是我们最大的幸福，最大的光荣。我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干。根据毛主席的最新指示，我们迅速掀起了一个革命大联合的新高潮。我们工总司所属十个区的无产阶级革命派都已实现了革命大联合。革命的大批判，革命的三结合，本单位的斗批改，抓革命、促生产等也出现了新的跃进。这是毛主席最新指示的辉煌胜利，是大学毛主席著作的结果。
    放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进。我们一定要用毛泽东思想来进一步提高我们的政治觉悟，坚决地“斗私，批修”，彻底铲除小资产阶级的派性，大破私字，大立公字，实现思想革命化。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘大好革命形势的东风，高歌猛进。
