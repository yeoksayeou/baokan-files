Our embassy staff in Indonesia have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fought against the Indonesian reactionary military and police.

On October 7, Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to all staff of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, expressing his warmest greetings to them for their brave and tenacious struggle against the armed military and police, as well as the mobs, who were ordered by the Indonesian reactionary government to attack the embassy on October 1. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To all staff of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia:

On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend my warmest greetings to you all.

On October 1, when the Indonesian reactionary government ordered armed military and police, as well as mobs, to launch a frenzied attack on your embassy, you raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly facing the enemy and bravely resisting their aggression.

The twenty staff members of your embassy, in defense of the dignity of our motherland and the cause of justice for humanity, fought bravely against more than a thousand armed reactionary military and police, and mobs, with bare hands. All of you were honorably wounded, fully demonstrating that Chinese diplomatic personnel, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are invincible in any difficult and dangerous situation.

Your brave struggle has greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and thoroughly exposed the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionary clique, which is a running dog of U.S. imperialism.

You are truly heroic sons and daughters of our great motherland and red diplomats of Chairman Mao. Your heroic deeds have set a brilliant example for all diplomatic personnel in our country.

I hope that you will continue to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be prepared to face more intense struggles at any time, and strive for even greater victories.

Zhou Enlai
October 7, 1967
