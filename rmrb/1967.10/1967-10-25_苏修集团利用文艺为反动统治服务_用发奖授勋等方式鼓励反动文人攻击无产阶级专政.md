The Soviet revisionist clique is using literature and art to serve its reactionary rule. It encourages reactionary writers to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat by awarding prizes and decorations.

Recently, the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist clique has intensified its policy of buying over the literary and art circles, awarding a large number of prizes, conferring a large number of decorations, and extolling reactionary writers. They promote reactionary works to further encourage reactionary writers to attack the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Not long after the 23rd Congress of the CPSU, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR jointly issued a resolution to significantly increase the amount of the "Lenin Prize," from the original 7,500 rubles to 10,000 rubles. At the same time, a new "State Prize" was established, to be awarded annually, with 60 recipients each year, including 10 in literature and art, each with a prize of 5,000 rubles.

The Russian Federation and various republics have also established "State Prizes." For example, the Russian Federation has set up 12 types of "State Prizes" in literature and art, to be awarded annually starting from 1966. Even the Soviet revisionist Komsomol established an annual "Lenin Komsomol Prize" last May to reward revisionist literary and artistic works.

In addition to establishing new prizes, the Soviet revisionist clique has also conferred various titles and medals on revisionist writers in batches. In February of this year, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR conferred the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor" on seven writers and awarded them the "Order of Lenin" and the "Gold Hammer and Sickle Medal." Such a large-scale conferral of the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor" on writers is unprecedented in the Soviet Union.

The first to be named as a recipient of the "Hero of Socialist Labor" title is the notorious literary head of revisionism, Sholokhov. It is this Sholokhov who, in his work "And Quiet Flows the Don," viciously attacks the great October Socialist Revolution and sings praises for counter-revolutionaries; in "One Man's Fate," he distorts the great Soviet Patriotic War, portraying traitors as "heroes." It is this Sholokhov who, at the time of Stalin's death, pretended to weep bitterly, calling Stalin his "dear lifelong beloved father." But soon, he tore off his mask, following Khrushchev in his anti-Stalin campaign, shamelessly saying he had an "unspeakable" "admiration" for Khrushchev. It is this Sholokhov, dressed in the cloak of a "Communist Party member," who regards the Nobel Prize for Literature, awarded by Western bourgeois elements, as the highest honor, fully exposing his lackey nature. Because of his actions, even Japanese bourgeois newspapers do not hesitate to call him a "new Soviet aristocrat who has forgotten the workers." Such a person is a thoroughgoing trumpet for the restoration of capitalism, a thoroughgoing bourgeois, and a complete lackey of imperialism.

The extremely shameless reactionary writer Simonov is also greatly extolled. His work "The Living and the Dead," which maliciously defames the Soviet anti-Fascist war and fiercely attacks Stalin, won the Russian State Prize. Soon after Stalin's death, Simonov followed Khrushchev in fiercely attacking the socialist system, opposing Stalin, and maliciously cursing the dictatorship of the proletariat. This court writer is very active in the Soviet revisionist anti-China chorus. Therefore, he is particularly favored by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Those who were also conferred the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor" include the Soviet revisionist lackeys, Konyuchev and Tursun-Zade, who often fiercely attack China at various international conferences.

To expand the influence of the reactionary film "The Living and the Dead," the Soviet revisionist clique has particularly focused on extolling this reactionary film, awarding it many prizes at once—whether it be the author, director, cinematographer, or male lead, all received awards. Other films and plays that attack Stalin and defame the dictatorship of the proletariat, novels that advocate pacifism, and films that depict the cruelty of class struggle—all these poisonous weeds have also received various awards.

The Soviet revisionist clique is taking these measures at a time when their reactionary nature is increasingly exposed and they are facing strong resistance from the people at home and abroad, and when the Soviet literary and art circles are in chaos. The editorial of the Soviet "Pravda" reveals that this is a "new and important social event in the policy of the Party and the state in the field of artistic creation." Its so-called "importance" is obviously in stabilizing the internal affairs of the Soviet literary and art circles, maintaining reactionary rule, and further launching a new wave of anti-communism, anti-China, anti-people, and anti-revolution.

However, the Soviet revisionist clique's despicable tactics cannot deceive the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist newspapers lament that some films, which have won "prizes, certificates, and awards" many times and are "widely praised" by the Soviet revisionist clique, "do not succeed with the broad audience," and the audience "does not believe" the Soviet revisionist clique's "advertisements."

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The various reactionaries of the world are also such a bunch of fools." The Soviet revisionist leadership, in its unbridled buying over of reactionary writers and promotion of reactionary works, can only make the broad masses of the Soviet people see more clearly the thoroughly traitorous nature of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique.

### 苏修集团利用文艺为反动统治服务  用发奖授勋等方式鼓励反动文人攻击无产阶级专政

    苏修集团利用文艺为反动统治服务
    用发奖授勋等方式鼓励反动文人攻击无产阶级专政
    最近，勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义集团，在文艺界加紧推行收买政策，大量发奖，大批授勋，大肆吹捧反动文人，宣扬反动作品，进一步鼓励反动文人攻击社会主义制度和无产阶级专政。
    苏共二十三大以后不久，苏共中央和苏联部长会议就联名公布了一项决议，大大提高“列宁奖金”金额，由原来七千五百卢布提高到一万卢布。同时，增设一项新的“国家奖金”，每年颁发一次，得奖人数为六十人，其中文学艺术为十人，每一个奖的金额为五千卢布。
    俄罗斯联邦和各加盟共和国也都设立了“国家奖金”。如俄罗斯联邦，在文学和艺术方面设立了十二种“国家奖金”，从一九六六年起，每年颁发一次。连苏修的共青团也于去年五月建立了一项每年颁发一次的“列宁共青团奖金”，以犒赏修正主义的文艺作品。
    除增设奖金外，苏修集团还成批授予修正主义作家以各种称号，发给各种名称的奖章。今年二月，苏联最高苏维埃一次就授予七个作家以“社会主义劳动英雄”称号，并颁发“列宁勋章”和“镰刀铁锤金质奖章”。这样成批地给文人封为“社会主义劳动英雄”，在苏联还是第一次。
    所谓被名列“社会主义劳动英雄”称号获得者首位的，是臭名昭著的修正主义文学头目肖洛霍夫。就是这个肖洛霍夫，在他的作品《静静的顿河》中恶毒地攻击伟大的十月社会主义革命，为反革命分子大唱颂歌；在《一个人的遭遇》中歪曲伟大的苏联卫国战争，把叛徒吹捧为“英雄”。就是这个肖洛霍夫，在斯大林逝世时曾假惺惺地痛哭流涕，把斯大林称为“亲爱的终生都热爱的父亲”。但是没有多久，他就撕掉了假面具，追随赫鲁晓夫大反斯大林，恬不知耻地说自己对赫鲁晓夫有“说不出口”的“男人的”“爱慕之情”。就是这个披着“共产党员”外衣的肖洛霍夫，把得到西方资产阶级分子犒赏的诺贝尔文学奖金视为无上光荣，十足暴露出他的走狗相。由于他的所作所为，连日本资产阶级报刊都不讳言他是“忘掉了工人的苏联新贵族”。这种人是彻底的资本主义复辟的吹鼓手，地地道道的资产阶级分子，十足的帝国主义奴仆。
    极端无耻的反动文人西蒙诺夫也被大肆吹捧。他所创作的恶毒丑化苏联反法西斯战争、疯狂反斯大林的作品《生者与死者》，获得了俄罗斯国家奖金。西蒙诺夫在斯大林逝世后不久，就追随赫鲁晓夫猖狂攻击社会主义制度，大反斯大林，恶毒咒骂无产阶级专政。这个御用文人，在苏修反华大合唱中，非常卖力。因此，他也特别受到苏修领导集团的赏识。
    被封为“社会主义劳动英雄”的还有苏修走卒，经常在各种国际会议上猖狂反华的小丑考涅楚克和图尔松—扎杰等。
    为了扩大影片《生者与死者》的影响，苏修集团特别着力于吹捧这部反动影片，一下子给这部影片发了许多个奖，什么作者啦，导演啦，摄影师啦，男主角啦，统统得了奖。其它一些攻击斯大林、丑化无产阶级专政的影片与话剧，宣扬和平主义的小说，渲染阶级斗争残酷的影片等一大批毒草，也分别得到了这样或那样的奖励。
    苏修集团是在他们的反动面目日益暴露，遭到国内外广大人民强烈反击，而苏修文艺界也呈现出一片混乱的时刻，采取这一系列措施的。苏联《真理报》社论透露，这是苏修“党和国家在艺术创作方面的政策的新的重要社会事件”。其所谓“重要”，显然是在于稳定苏修文艺界内部，维持反动统治，进一步掀起反共、反华、反人民、反革命的新浪潮。
    但是，苏修集团这种卑劣手法欺骗不了苏联人民。苏修报纸哀叹说：有些屡次获得“奖品、奖状和奖赏”、被苏修集团“广泛推崇”的影片，“在广大的观众中得不到成功”，观众“不相信”苏修集团的“广告”。
    伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”苏修领导集团这样不顾一切地收买反动文人，宣扬反动作品，只能促使苏联广大人民更进一步看清勃列日涅夫—柯西金之流彻头彻尾的叛徒面目。　（据新华社讯）
