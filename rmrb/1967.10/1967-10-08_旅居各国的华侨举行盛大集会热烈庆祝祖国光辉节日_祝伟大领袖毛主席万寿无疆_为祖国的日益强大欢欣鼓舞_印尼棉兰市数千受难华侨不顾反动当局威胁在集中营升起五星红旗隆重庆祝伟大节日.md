This reception was held under the continued provocative surveillance and monitoring of the Chinese Charge d'Affaires and other Chinese institutions in the UK by the British police authorities. However, the anti-China provocations and threats of the British authorities could not stop the overseas Chinese in the UK from their boundless love for the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great socialist motherland. They wore Mao badges with great pride and arrived at the Charge d'Affaires early.

		Thousands of persecuted overseas Chinese, driven from various places in Sumatra to Medan by the Indonesian reactionaries, defied the "warnings" and "orders" issued by the Medan reactionary authorities and held a solemn gathering in the concentration camp on October 1 to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

		The Medan reactionary authorities openly dispatched a large number of armed military police to brutally suppress the gathering. Four persecuted overseas Chinese were beaten to death on the spot, and many were injured. This is another blood debt owed by the Indonesian fascist military regime to the 700 million Chinese people!

		However, the broad masses of persecuted overseas Chinese, undaunted by the severe white terror, still held a solemn gathering to celebrate the great national day of the motherland. They defied the reactionaries' "warnings" and "orders" and raised the solemn five-star red flag in the concentration camp, sang the national anthem, and expressed their deep feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and the powerful socialist motherland.

		The patriotic action of the overseas Chinese caused panic among the Medan reactionary authorities. They openly dispatched a large number of armed military police to storm the venue and open fire on the unarmed patriotic overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought fought back with stones and bottles, engaging in a fierce struggle with the reactionary military police. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
