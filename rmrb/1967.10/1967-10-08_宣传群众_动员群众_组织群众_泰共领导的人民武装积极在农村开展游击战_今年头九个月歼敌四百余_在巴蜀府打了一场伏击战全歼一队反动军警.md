The Communist Party of Thailand's armed forces are actively waging guerrilla warfare in rural areas, strengthening propaganda and organizing peasant masses, and achieving continuous victories.

According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on October 5, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the patriotic armed struggle of the Thai people is surging forward, demonstrating the power of people's war. In the first nine months of this year, more than 400 enemy personnel have been annihilated, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Prapat traitorous clique.

The radio station reported that, according to incomplete statistics, in the first nine months of this year, the people's armed forces engaged in 178 battles with the enemy. Additionally, they attacked enemy strongholds and ambushed the enemy 91 times, and entered enemy-occupied villages to propagandize and mobilize the masses 126 times. In these battles, the people's armed forces killed 205 enemy personnel, wounded 164, and captured 35.

The radio station emphasized that despite the frantic repression by U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Prapat traitorous clique, the development and growth of the Thai people's armed forces are unstoppable.

According to another report, the Thai people's armed forces have been particularly active in several provinces in the central region recently. On September 22, the people's armed forces in Khao Wichai District, Phetchaburi Province, bravely and intelligently launched an ambush, completely annihilating a squad of reactionary police from the Thanom-Prapat traitorous clique. The people's armed forces first blew up the jeep carrying the reactionary police, then opened fire, immediately killing all the enemies on the vehicle, including a police lieutenant colonel. The people's armed forces also seized all the weapons of the reactionary police. In addition to Phetchaburi, the people's armed forces in the central region of Thailand have also actively carried out armed propaganda in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Lopburi, and Nakhon Pathom provinces, receiving a warm welcome from the peasant masses.

In September, the Thai people's armed forces also launched several ambushes in the northeastern provinces of Sakhon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, and in the southern provinces of Nakhon Si Thammarat and Yala. In addition to annihilating a batch of reactionary military police, they also executed some local tyrants, evil gentry, and spy elements who were enemies of the people.

Due to the continuous strikes by the people's armed forces, the Thanom-Prapat traitorous clique is hurriedly deploying troops, attempting to reverse the failing situation. However, some reactionary leaders of this traitorous clique recently had to admit that they could not cope even after deploying a large number of military police. A high-ranking reactionary military officer recently told a Western reporter in Sakhon Nakhon that the guerrilla tactics were very mobile and flexible. When the reactionary military police arrived in large numbers, the guerrillas had already disappeared into the jungle. At night, the guerrillas often took the initiative to launch attacks.

    宣传群众　动员群众　组织群众
    泰共领导的人民武装积极在农村开展游击战
    今年头九个月歼敌四百余　在巴蜀府打了一场伏击战全歼一队反动军警
    新华社五日讯　泰国共产党领导的人民武装积极在农村地区展开游击战争，加强宣传和组织农民群众的工作，不断取得胜利。
    据“泰国人民之声”电台五日广播，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，泰国人民的爱国武装斗争风起云涌，发挥了人民战争的威力，今年头九个月共歼灭敌人四百多人，沉重打击了美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团。
    电台说，根据不完全的统计数字，在今年头九个月里，人民武装同敌人进行了一百七十八次战斗，此外还袭击敌人据点和伏击敌人九十一次，进入敌后村庄宣传动员群众一百二十六次。在这些战斗中，人民武装共打死敌人二百零五人，打伤一百六十四人，俘虏三十五人。
    这家电台强调指出，尽管美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团正在加紧进行疯狂镇压，但泰国人民武装的发展壮大是任何力量不能阻挡的。
    另据报道，泰国人民武装最近在中部几个府特别活跃。九月二十二日，巴蜀府圭武里县人民武装英勇机智地打了一场伏击战，全歼了他侬—巴博卖国集团的一队反动警察。人民武装首先炸毁了反动警察乘坐的吉普车，接着开枪向车上敌人猛烈射击，立即将其全部击毙，其中有一名警察中校；人民武装并缴获了反动警察的全部武器。在泰国中部，除巴蜀府外，人民武装还在佛丕、叻丕和北碧等府积极展开武装宣传，受到了农民群众的热烈欢迎。
    泰国人民武装九月间还在东北部的沙功那空、那空拍侬以及南部的洛坤、亚拉等府进行了多次伏击战，除了歼灭一批反动军警外，还处决了一些与人民为敌的土豪恶霸和特务分子。
    由于泰国反动军警接连受到了人民武装的打击，他侬—巴博卖国集团正在慌忙调兵遣将，妄图挽救失败的局面。但是，这个卖国集团的一些反动头子最近不得不承认，他们出动了大批军警也感到无法对付。一名高级反动军官最近在沙功那空对一个西方记者说，游击队的战术很机动灵活，反动军警大队开到时，游击队已经消失在丛林中，而在夜间，游击队还经常主动出击。
