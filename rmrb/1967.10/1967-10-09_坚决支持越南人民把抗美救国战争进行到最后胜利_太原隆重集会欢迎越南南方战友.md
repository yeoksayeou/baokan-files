Taiyuan held a grand rally to welcome comrades from South Vietnam

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 8th: Over 5,000 revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Taiyuan held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly welcome the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, led by combat hero Huang Wendan. They resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the very end, until final victory.

The meeting was held at the Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Assembly Hall in the city center. The atmosphere in the venue was filled with the spirit of unity and struggle between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The revolutionary masses sang "The East is Red" and repeatedly raised their fists, shouting, "Down with American imperialism!" When the heroic comrades from South Vietnam arrived at the venue, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time, and together recited the words of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in the struggle. This is how the people of South Vietnam are doing it."

Comrade Liu Geping, Chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, spoke first. He, on behalf of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and the 18 million people of the province, extended a high combat salute to the heroes from the front lines of the anti-American war. He enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam in their heroic struggle against the American aggressors.

Under the warm applause, Huang Wendan, the leader of the delegation, was invited to speak. He strongly condemned the heinous crimes of American imperialism and its running dogs in continuing to pursue their policies of aggression and war in South Vietnam. He said, the facts on the battlefield in South Vietnam have already proven: the more the American aggressors and their lackeys struggle, the more shameful their defeats. He said, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and all the military and people highly value the great assistance of the brotherly Chinese people to the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle. After we return to South Vietnam, we will convey to all the military and people of South Vietnam your shared friendship in times of trouble. Nguyen Van Binh, who has been awarded four times for his bravery in killing the enemy, reported to the meeting his heroic deeds of annihilating American devils.

Also present at the welcoming rally were Deputy Chairmen of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, Yuan Zhen, and leaders of the Shanxi Military Region and the garrison, Cao Yuqing, and Xie Zhenhua.

The comrades from South Vietnam this morning visited the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, where they were warmly welcomed by revolutionary workers.

    据新华社太原八日电　太原市无产阶级革命派五千多人，今天下午隆重集会，热烈欢迎由战斗英雄黄文旦率领的越南南方民族解放阵线代表团，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，直到最后胜利。
    大会在位于市中心的工农兵大会堂举行。会场上呈现着中越两国人民团结战斗的气氛。革命群众高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，并一再振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”当英雄的越南南方战友们来到会场时，全场起立，长时间热烈鼓掌欢迎，并且齐声朗读伟大领袖毛主席语录：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。越南南方人民就是这样做的。”
    山西省革命委员会主任刘格平同志首先讲话，他代表山西省革命委员会和全省一千八百万人民向来自抗美战争前线的英雄们致以崇高的战斗敬礼。他热烈赞扬越南南方军民在英勇抗击美国侵略者的斗争中取得的伟大胜利。
    黄文旦团长在热烈的掌声中应邀讲话。他强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗在越南南方继续推行它们的侵略政策和战争政策的滔天罪行。他说，越南南方战场上的事实已经证明：美国侵略者及其仆从走狗愈是挣扎，愈是遭到可耻的失败。他说，越南南方民族解放阵线和全体军民，高度估价兄弟的中国人民对越南人民抗美救国斗争的巨大援助。我们回到越南南方以后，将向南方全体军民转达你们患难与共的战斗友情。四次评为歼敌勇士的阮玉裴，向大会报告了他歼灭美国鬼子的英勇事迹。
