President Moktar Ould Daddah of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania delivered the following speech at the banquet hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai:

	Total Prime Minister, distinguished guests, dear friends:

	First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China for the kind words he addressed to me and, through me, to our country.

	I bring you the friendly greetings of the Party, government, and people of Mauritania. First, on behalf of the delegation accompanying me and in my own name, I would like to express our gratitude to the Chinese government and people for the very warm welcome and friendly sentiments they have shown us since we set foot on the soil of the People's Republic of China.

	The Chinese people, known for their hospitality, have treated us in this manner, which does not surprise us. Mauritania has had such experiences, especially this year in February, when an important delegation led by our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Biram Mamadou Wane, visited your beautiful country and had similar feelings.

	I am pleased to note that during that visit, our two countries signed cooperation agreements in the fields of culture, technology, economy, and trade, particularly in agriculture, which have already entered the stage of concrete implementation. This is extremely beneficial for the peoples of our two countries.

	I believe that our current visit will help to further strengthen the already friendly relations between our two countries, thus enabling the cooperation that has started smoothly to continue to develop.

	Prime Minister,

	Gentlemen:

	Mauritania watches with great sympathy the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of their wise leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, in the path of development and progress.

	Socialism has opened a breach in the imperialism that has not yet been disarmed and has become more brutal as the end approaches, and China is making new leaps in consolidating socialism through an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution.

	Prime Minister,

	Gentlemen:

	You are already familiar with Mauritania and her efforts under the leadership of the Mauritanian People's Party to consolidate independence and free her economy from underdevelopment.

	The achievements we have already made on this path have not made us forget what we still need to do to overcome underdevelopment. Surprisingly, this underdevelopment itself is very stubborn, even deeply rooted.

	To be frank, we understand the relationship between underdevelopment and imperialism.

	This relationship enables us to better understand the current situation in Africa. This is a poor and divided Africa, but there are also factors for self-strengthening, namely the rich underground resources of Africa, and above all, the will of the African people to unite to better resist foreign imperialism and ultimately defeat imperialism.

	In fact, Africa is taking Mao Zedong's famous teaching: "Dare to struggle, dare to win" as its motto; the heroic Chinese people have successfully put this motto into practice. As long as there is an Asian or African country under foreign rule, the peoples of Asia and Africa should not relax their efforts. We must assist the revolutionaries of Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea in both moral and material terms. We must do everything in our power to eradicate the notorious regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa, of course, these regimes are shamefully plotted by imperialists and supported by imperialists.

	Imperialism, in its desperate struggle to save itself, is extremely brutal.

	Recently, we have another proof of this, which is the bloody aggression of imperialism against the peoples of the Middle East countries in June this year, part of whose territories are still under the occupation of the imperialist agent Israel. However, we are very clear that, as a Chinese proverb says, they "lift the stone only to drop it on their own feet."

	Then, how should we view the escalation of this criminal war that we have seen in Vietnam for many years? Is this not a good illustration of a certain imperialist country knowing that it is doomed to failure, yet "drinking poison to quench thirst," trying to escape its impending doom through violence?

	In such circumstances, it can be said that only through joint great efforts and constant vigilance can we overcome the difficult times. Therefore, we should fully trust the efforts made by the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, that is, the Third World countries, to achieve economic integration and even political integration.

	Naturally, unity binds the peoples of these three continents together, whether people like it or not, this unity will inevitably lead to unification.

	It is with this spirit that we Mauritanian people have come from afar to strengthen the friendly relations between our people and the great revolutionary people of China through practical actions.

	Now, I propose a toast

	To the strengthening of friendly ties between the peoples of Mauritania and China,
	To the strengthening of unity among the peoples of Asia and Africa,
	To the health of the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong,
	To the health of Premier Zhou Enlai,
	To the health of the ambassadors and their spouses,
	To the health of the friends and comrades present,

	Cheers!

    达达赫总统在周恩来总理欢迎宴会上讲话
    以实际行动加强毛中两国人民之间的友好关系
    新华社二十日讯　毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国总统莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫在周恩来总理举行的欢迎宴会上的讲话，全文如下：总理先生，诸位阁下，亲爱的朋友们：
    首先，我向中华人民共和国总理先生表示谢意，感谢你方才对我所讲的，并且通过我对我们国家所讲的亲切的话。
    我给你们带来了毛里塔尼亚党、政府和人民的友好敬意。首先，我代表随我前来的代表团，并以我本人的名义，向中国政府和中国人民致以谢意，感谢他们从我们踏上中华人民共和国国土之时起一直对我们所表示的十分热烈的欢迎和亲切的友情。
    以殷勤好客而著称的中国人民给予我们这样的款待，这并不使我们感到惊奇。
    毛里塔尼亚早就有过这样的体会，特别是今年二月，由我国外交部长比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼率领的一个重要代表团，在你们美丽的国家访问时，就有这样的感受。
    我高兴地指出，在那次访问时，我们两国签订了文化、技术、经济和贸易方面的合作协定，尤其是在农业方面的合作，已经进入了具体执行的阶段，这是极其有利于我们两国人民的。
    我相信，我们的这次访问将有助于进一步增进我们两国之间业已存在的十分友好的联系，从而使已经顺利开始的这种合作能够继续发展。
    总理先生，
    先生们：
    毛里塔尼亚怀着极大的同情注视着中国人民在他们英明的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，在发展和进步的道路上所取得的成就。
    社会主义被尚未解除武装和随着末日来临而更加残暴的帝国主义打开了一个缺口，而中国正在通过史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，在巩固社会主义方面，实现新的跃进。
    总理先生，
    先生们：
    你们已经了解毛里塔尼亚，了解她在毛里塔尼亚人民党的领导下为巩固独立、使自己的经济摆脱不发达状态所作的努力。
    我们在这条道路上已经取得的成就，并没有使我们忘记为了克服不发达状态而应继续做的事。令人感到意外的是，这种不发达状态本身是很顽固的，甚至可以说，是根深蒂固的。
    老实说，我们是了解不发达状态同帝国主义之间的关系的。
    这种关系使我们能够更好地了解非洲当前的局势。这是一个贫瘠的非洲被分裂的非洲，但也存在着足以自强的因素，这就是非洲的富饶的地下资源，尤其是非洲的人民为了更好地抵御外国帝国主义和最后战胜帝国主义而团结一致的意志。
    实际上，非洲正将毛泽东主席的著名教导：敢于斗争，敢于胜利，当作自己的格言；英勇的中国人民非常成功地把这一格言付诸实践。只要还有一个亚洲国家或非洲国家处在外国统治之下，亚非各国人民就不应放松自己的努力。我们必须在道义上和物质上援助安哥拉、莫三鼻给和“葡属”几内亚的革命者。我们必须尽一切努力，根除臭名昭彰的罗得西亚和南非政权这样的脓疮，当然，这些政权是由帝国主义者可耻地阴谋制造出来并得到帝国主义者支持的。
    帝国主义为了挽救败局而进行垂死挣扎时，极尽残暴之能事。
    最近，我们又得到一个证明，这就是帝国主义今年六月对中东各国人民进行了血腥的侵略，这些国家的部分领土仍然处在帝国主义代理人以色列的占领下。但是，我们很清楚，正如中国一句俗语所说的那样，他们“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    那么，对于我们多年来在越南看到的这一罪恶的战争升级，又应怎样看待呢？这岂不是很好地说明了某一个帝国主义国家明明知道败局已定，却“饮鸩止渴”，企图用暴行摆脱即将灭亡的命运吗？
    在这种情况下，可以认为，只有通过共同的巨大努力并经常保持警惕，才能渡过困难的岁月。因此，我们应该对于亚、非、拉各国，即第三世界各国为实现经济一体化以至于政治一体化所作出的努力付予完全的信任。
    理所当然的团结把这三大洲的人民连结在一起，不管人们愿意与否，这种团结必将导致统一。
    我们毛里塔尼亚人正是本着这种精神远道而来，以实际行动来加强我国人民和伟大中国的革命人民之间的友好关系。
    现在，我提议
    为增进毛中两国人民之间的友好联系，
    为加强亚非各国人民的团结，
    为中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东主席的健康，
    为周恩来总理的健康，
    为诸位大使和他们的夫人的健康，
    为在座的朋友们和同志们的健康，
    干杯！
