On October 21, the Israeli warship "Eilat" provoked the United Arab Republic (UAR) and was sunk by the UAR navy. This was well-deserved. However, the Israeli aggressors loudly proclaimed that they would "do as they did five months ago," launching another invasion, and bombarded the UAR's Suez Port. This is a new war provocation by U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel against Arab countries.

In June of this year, the U.S. and Israel launched a large-scale armed invasion in the Middle East. After declaring a so-called "ceasefire," the Israeli aggressors not only continued to occupy Arab territories but also constantly threatened and provoked militarily. In early October, Israeli Defense Minister Dayan arrogantly boasted, "The current ceasefire line is not far from Damascus, Amman, and Cairo," and if war breaks out again, Israel will "enter various Arab capitals." Israel's latest war provocation is a deliberate step in its further invasion of Arab countries.

The reason the Israeli aggressors are so arrogant is that U.S. imperialism is backing them. After the Israeli warship was sunk, the U.S. State Department spokesman and the White House press secretary immediately attacked and threatened the UAR. Johnson and Rusk also held secret talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Eban. At the same time, the U.S. State Department announced the resumption of arms supplies to Israel and immediately provided Israel with sixty military aircraft. It is under such blatant encouragement and support from U.S. imperialism that Israel brazenly bombarded the UAR's Suez Port, escalating military provocations against Arab countries.

The reason the Israeli aggressors are so arrogant is also due to the collusion between the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism, their betrayal of Arab countries, and their indulgence of Israeli aggression. After the Soviet revisionist leadership colluded with U.S. imperialism to force Arab countries to accept the "ceasefire" in June this year, it continued to collude with U.S. imperialism, engaging in extensive treacherous activities. According to the secret agreement between Kosygin and Johnson in Glassboro, the U.S. and the Soviet Union conducted intense transactions within and outside the United Nations, trying to deceive and pressure Arab countries into submission.

On the Middle East issue, the Soviet revisionist leadership has always played the role of a counter-revolutionary two-faced character, using the tactic of false support and real betrayal. This was the case when the U.S. and Israel launched the invasion in June this year, and it is the same this time when the U.S. and Israel are provoking war against Arab countries. The editorial in the Soviet "Pravda" on October 24, on the one hand, hypocritically criticized Israel's "provocations," demanding that Israel "withdraw from the occupied lands"; on the other hand, it emphasized the need to open a "political solution that considers the interests of both sides." What a "political solution that considers the interests of both sides"! This exposes the true face of the Soviet revisionist group in betraying the Arab people. The U.S. and Israel are the aggressors, and the Arab countries are the victims. Their interests cannot be reconciled. To "consider" the interests of the aggressors would inevitably harm the interests of the victims. The so-called "political solution that considers the interests of both sides" by the Soviet revisionist group, stripped of its disguise, means that Arab countries should sacrifice their own interests to "consider" the interests of the aggressors; it means that Arab countries should, according to the unreasonable demands of the U.S.-Israeli aggressors, tolerate Israel's occupation of large tracts of Arab land, lay down their arms, and stop the anti-aggression struggle; it means to maintain the new colonialist invasion stronghold led by the United States in the Middle East and realize the U.S. imperialist's wild ambition to expand its aggression against Arab countries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that the nature of imperialism "cannot be changed." The only way is to organize forces to fight against them.

U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel are the mortal enemies of the peoples of all Arab countries. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will never give up their aggression against Arab countries. The Soviet revisionist group will never stop its treacherous activities. The Arab people need to maintain high vigilance against them and engage in a head-on struggle.

The Chinese government and people have always firmly supported the Arab people's just struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression. We believe that as long as the Arab people unite more closely and persist in the anti-aggression struggle, they will definitely be able to defeat the aggression and provocations of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and achieve final victory.

    坚决挫败美以对阿拉伯国家的战争挑衅
    本报评论员
    十月二十一日，以色列军舰“埃拉特号”向阿联挑衅，被阿联海军击沉。这是罪有应得。但是，以色列侵略者却借此大叫大嚷，扬言要“象五个月以前一样”，重新发动侵略战争，并且炮轰了阿联的苏伊士港。这是美帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯国家的新的战争挑衅。
    今年六月，美以在中东发动大规模武装侵略。在宣布了所谓“停火”以后，以色列侵略者不仅继续霸占着阿拉伯国家的领土，而且不断地进行武力威胁和军事挑衅。十月初，以色列国防部长达扬狂妄地叫嚣，“目前的停火线离大马士革、安曼、开罗并不远”，如果再爆发战争，以色列就要“进入各阿拉伯首都”。以色列的这一次战争挑衅，完全是它进一步侵略阿拉伯国家的一个既定步骤。
    以色列侵略者所以这样嚣张，是由于美帝国主义在背后给它撑腰。以色列军舰被击沉以后，美国国务院发言人和白宫新闻秘书立即出来攻击和威胁阿联。约翰逊、腊斯克还同以色列外长埃班进行了密谈。在这同时，美国国务院宣布恢复向以色列提供军火，并且马上给以色列六十架军用飞机。正是在美帝国主义这种明目张胆的鼓励和支持下，以色列悍然炮轰阿联的苏伊士港，扩大了对阿拉伯国家的军事挑衅。
    以色列侵略者所以这样嚣张，也是由于苏修领导集团勾结美帝国主义、出卖阿拉伯国家、纵容以色列侵略的结果。在今年六月苏修领导集团串通美帝迫使阿拉伯国家接受“停火”以后，它一直继续勾结美帝，大搞叛卖活动。按照柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗的秘密协议，美苏之间在联合国内外进行了紧张的交易，竭力诱骗和压迫阿拉伯国家就范。
    在中东问题上，苏修领导集团一直玩弄假支持、真出卖的手法，扮演反革命两面派的角色。在今年六月美以发动侵略战争时是这样，在这一次美以向阿拉伯国家进行战争挑衅时又是这样。苏联《真理报》十月二十四日的评论，一面假惺惺地指责以色列的“挑衅”，要以色列“从占领的土地上走开”；一面大讲要开辟“考虑到双方利益的政治解决的道路”。好一个“考虑到双方利益的政治解决”！这就暴露了苏修集团出卖阿拉伯人民的真面目。美以是侵略者，阿拉伯国家是被侵略者，双方的利益是不可能调和的。要“考虑”侵略者的利益，就必然要损害被侵略者的利益。苏修集团所谓“考虑到双方利益的政治解决”，拆穿了说，就是要阿拉伯国家牺牲自己的利益，去“考虑”侵略者的利益；就是要阿拉伯国家按照美以侵略者的无理要求，容忍以色列侵占阿拉伯国家的大片领土，放下武器，停止反侵略斗争；就是要维护以美国为首的新殖民主义在中东的侵略阵地，实现美帝国主义扩大侵略阿拉伯国家的狂妄野心。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说，帝国主义的“本性是不能改变的”。“唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。
    美帝国主义及其走狗以色列，是阿拉伯各国人民的死敌。美帝国主义和它的走狗绝不会放弃对阿拉伯国家的侵略。苏修集团也决不会停止它的叛卖活动。阿拉伯人民需要对它们保持高度的警惕，同它们进行针锋相对的斗争。
    中国政府和中国人民一贯坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美以侵略的正义斗争。我们相信，阿拉伯人民只要更加紧密地团结起来，坚持反侵略斗争，就一定能够挫败美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和挑衅，赢得最后胜利。
