The amateur art troupe "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun" from Tirana, Albania, performed for the first time in Beijing this evening at the Great Hall of the People, receiving an extremely warm welcome.

Central leaders and responsible officials from various sectors, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Xie Fuzhi, Yang Chengwu, Cheng Benyu, Wu Faxian, Wang Dongxing, Zhang Ziyu, Liu Xiao, and Luo Guibo, watched the performance.

Comrade Muhammad Shehu, Comrade Ramiz Alia, and other members of the Albanian Party and Government delegation also attended the performance.

When the leaders of China and Albania entered the Great Hall of the People, the entire audience of ten thousand people stood up and applauded enthusiastically, repeatedly and rhythmically chanting, "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong."

The Albanian artists, in tonight's performance, sang with great passion in praise of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, and enthusiastically sang of the fraternal fighting friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania. The performance began with the projection of the radiant images of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha on the screen. Albanian cultural warriors, holding the flags of the two countries, marched onto the stage and sang "The Party of Labor—The Heroic Party" and "The East Is Red." Their performance, filled with proletarian revolutionary feelings, was deeply moving and immediately captivated the entire audience.

Tonight, the Albanian comrades sang many songs in Chinese in praise of Chairman Mao and songs composed based on Chairman Mao's quotations. The songs "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" performed by Man Tema and A. Mura, and the song "Beijing's Golden Mountains" performed by V. Zela, all received extremely enthusiastic applause. Composer A. Mura also performed tonight, passionately singing his composition "In Praise of Chairman Mao's First Big-Character Poster." He sang, "Ah! The great big-character poster, you are the blazing fire of the proletarian cultural revolution, igniting the proletarian cultural revolution.... Firing fiercely at the bourgeois headquarters, the doomsday of imperialism and revisionism has arrived." Young Pioneer Lu. Kasemi sang a song composed for Comrade Shehu's visit to China, "The Song of Sino-Albanian Friendship." Lu. Kasemi sang with deep emotion, "Comrade Muhammad Shehu, please represent the Albanian people in wishing Chairman Mao good health!" Their resonant voices moved the hearts of all.

Tonight, these Albanian amateur cultural warriors from the front lines of production and national defense also performed the choral pieces "Singing the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor," "Village Discussion Meeting," the dances "Destroy the Old and Establish the New," "Build the Country, Defend the Country," and the ballet "Adam Reka." They vividly reflected, through their wonderful songs and dances, the great victories achieved by the Albanian people under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor in their resolute march on the socialist road, in carrying out the movement for the revolutionary transformation of ideology, and in socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The audience also saw the Albanian cultural warriors perform an excerpt from the revolutionary model opera ballet "Red Detachment of Women" on the Chinese stage tonight.

The performance ended with all the performers singing "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." Zhang Ziyu, the director of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Zhou Yiping, the deputy director, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, presented a scroll to the art troupe. The scroll was inscribed with Chairman Mao's quotation:

"'Though you are thousands of miles away, you are as close as neighbors.' The two countries of China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends who are sweet-tongued but treacherous at heart, nor are we those two-faced people. The revolutionary and fighting friendship between us has withstood the test of storms and tempests."

Amidst thunderous applause, Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Comrades Shehu, Alia, and others walked onto the stage and shook hands warmly with the performers. At this moment, the entire audience's joyous mood reached its peak. The Albanian cultural warriors repeatedly and enthusiastically shouted, "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong."

During the intermission, Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Comrades Shehu, Alia, and others met with the troupe leader Mu. Gerchali and some of the troupe members, engaging in very cordial conversation.

The Albanian Writers and Artists Association delegation, the Albanian Consumer Cooperative delegation, the Albanian News delegation, and other Albanian comrades currently in Beijing also watched the performance. (Accompanied by a photograph)
