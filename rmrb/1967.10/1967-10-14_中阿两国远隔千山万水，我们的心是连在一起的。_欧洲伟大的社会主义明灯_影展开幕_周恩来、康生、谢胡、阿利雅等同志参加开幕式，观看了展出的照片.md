In the midst of the enthusiastic praise from the people of the entire country for the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, the photo exhibition titled "The Great Socialist Beacon of Europe" — featuring the visit of the Chinese Photography Delegation to Albania — was grandly opened this afternoon in the capital.

Central leaders and responsible comrades from various sectors, including Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, and Yang Chengwu, as well as revolutionary masses from the capital, attended the opening ceremony.

Albanian Party and Government Delegation Head, Politburo Member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Comrade Muhammad Shehu, and Albanian Party and Government Delegation Member, Politburo Member of the Central Committee, and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, Comrade Ramiz Alia, along with other members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, and other Albanian comrades in Beijing, were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

Today, inside and outside the Beijing Exhibition Hall where the exhibition is being held, the atmosphere was filled with the fervent friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. In the central hall of the exhibition, high above, hung portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, with the words "Long Live the Revolutionary Unity and Fighting Friendship Between the Two Parties and Two Peoples of China and Albania!" written in both Chinese and Albanian. Outside the exhibition hall, the national flags of China and Albania fluttered in the wind. At the entrance of the exhibition hall, on one side hung a quotation from Chairman Mao: "'Though we are far apart, our hearts are close.' The peoples of China and Albania, though separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are united." On the other side hung a quotation from Comrade Enver Hoxha: "The great friendship and ironclad internationalist unity between our two peoples and two countries are stronger than ever."

In the afternoon, Comrade Shehu and other Albanian comrades arrived at the exhibition hall by car, and the revolutionary masses of the capital warmly applauded and lined the streets to welcome the Albanian comrades. Subsequently, Comrades Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, and others, along with Comrades Shehu and Alia, together viewed the exhibited photographs.

Upon entering the spacious exhibition hall, the first thing that caught the eye was a large photograph of the great and unbreakable fighting friendship between the two parties and two peoples of China and Albania, featuring our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, warmly shaking hands. On either side of this radiant photograph stood two rows of red flags, with Chairman Mao's quotation behind them: "The parties and peoples of China and Albania should unite, all Marxist-Leninists in the world should unite, all revolutionary peoples in the world should unite, to defeat imperialism, to defeat modern revisionism, to defeat the reactionaries in all countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without systems of exploitation, will certainly be established."

The friendship between the two parties and two peoples of China and Albania is the greatest and most precious fighting friendship in the world. The exhibition hall first displayed photographs of the warm meetings between the leaders of the two parties and two countries over the past few years, including a photograph of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, together with Comrade Shehu and others, reviewing the parade on Tiananmen Rostrum this year. These photographs vividly show that the friendship between the two parties and two peoples of China and Albania is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is invincible, and will forever be praised by all revolutionary peoples.

Great leader Chairman Mao said: "Heroic Albania, a great socialist beacon in Europe." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the Chinese Photography Delegation visited Albania this summer and photographed the brilliant victories of the Albanian people in their socialist revolution and socialist construction from all angles. The more than 200 photographs on display enthusiastically praise the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, praise the Albanian Labor Party that has always held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism revolution, praise the heroic spirit of the Albanian people, introduce the great victories of the Albanian military and people in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, introduce the great achievements of the Albanian people who "hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other" in their socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially the achievements in their campaign to revolutionize ideology.

Many photographs also introduce the Albanian people's boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and their enthusiastic support for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When Comrades Shehu and others left the exhibition hall, the revolutionary masses of the capital lined the streets to see them off, shouting enthusiastically: "Long Live China-Albania Friendship!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

Those who attended today's opening ceremony also included responsible comrades from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality. Among them were Fang Yi, Li Zuopeng, Wu Faxian, Qiu Huizao, Zhang Zaiyu, Chu Tu-Nan, Ding Xilin, Li Qiang, Ding Guoyi, as well as China's Ambassador to Albania, Liu Xiao. Envoys and cultural attachés from various countries in China were also invited to attend the opening ceremony. (Accompanying photographs)

The Central Cultural Revolution Group organized an evening of performing arts, featuring Chinese and Albanian revolutionary performing artists performing the Chinese revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" together, to entertain the Albanian Party and Government Delegation. After the performance, Comrades Shehu and Alia, accompanied by Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, and Jiang Qing, went on stage to take a group photo with the performers.
