	Pledge to Defend the Great Red Banner of the People's Commune
	Shandong Province, Licheng County, Shuicun Brigade Poor Peasant Zhu Xiru

	As the saying goes, "To uproot a tree, you must dig up its roots." The number one capitalist-roader within the Party is the mastermind behind the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, the chief culprit opposing Chairman Mao and attacking the Three Red Banners.

	In August 1958, Chairman Mao issued the great call for "The People's Commune is good," pointing the way for five hundred million peasants. On August 20th, we established the Beiyuan People's Commune. However, the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously said, "The people's commune movement is not something that can appear just because someone shouts for it." This is a frenzied opposition to Chairman Mao, attempting to obstruct us poor and lower-middle peasants from following Chairman Mao on the socialist path.

	"Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism," under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the people's communes were quickly and universally established. The big and small capitalist-roaders within the Party did not give up, and they began to smear the Three Red Banners. During the three years of economic difficulties, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, in collusion with the class enemies at home and abroad, viciously attacked the people's communes, slandering them as "established too early," "established poorly," and "rushed into existence," vigorously advocating "distribution of land to households or responsibility to households."

	From the day the people's communes were born, the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices never forgot to oppose, slander, and attack the people's communes. They hate the people's communes to the bone, wishing to uproot this red banner and carry out a capitalist restoration. Chairman Mao said, "The majority of peasants in the country, in order to get rid of poverty and improve their lives, and to resist disasters, must unite and advance on the socialist path to achieve their goals." In the old society, we poor peasants were like cattle and horses, suffering enough hardships and injustices. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the fire pit. The Chinese Khrushchev wants us poor peasants to retrace our steps and suffer twice, which is absolutely impossible! "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates "three autonomies and one contract," and we blow a strong "individual farming wind," so we firmly oppose it.

	Chairman Mao said, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We poor peasants respond with a thousand affirmations and carry out Chairman Mao's instructions with ten thousand resolute actions! We will hold high the great red banner of the people's communes, denounce the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, closely follow Chairman Mao, and resolutely walk the socialist path.

　　誓死保卫人民公社伟大红旗
　　山东历城水屯大队贫农　朱希儒
    俗话说：刨树要刨根。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派就是地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神的总后台，是反对毛主席，攻击三面红旗的罪魁祸首。
    一九五八年八月，毛主席发出了“人民公社好”的伟大号召，给五亿农民指明了方向。八月二十日，俺们就办起了北园人民公社。中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说“人民公社运动不是什么人喊一下就会出现的”。他这是疯狂反对毛主席，想阻止俺们贫下中农跟毛主席走社会主义道路。
    “社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度”，在毛主席他老人家指引下，人民公社很快地普遍建立起来。党内大大小小走资本主义道路的当权派贼心不死，又给三面红旗抹黑。三年经济困难时期，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，配合国际国内阶级敌人恶毒攻击人民公社，诬蔑人民公社“办早了”，“办糟了”，是“一轰而起”，竭力鼓吹“分田到户或包产到户”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，自从人民公社诞生的头一天起，一时一刻也没忘记反对、诬蔑、攻击人民公社。他们从骨子里仇恨人民公社，妄想拔掉这面红旗，实行资本主义复辟。毛主席说：“全国大多数农民，为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的。”旧社会，俺们贫下中农当牛做马，吃够了苦，受够了罪，是毛主席他老人家把俺们从火坑中救了出来。中国赫鲁晓夫想叫俺贫下中农走回头路，受二遍罪，是万万办不到的！“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“三自一包”，大刮“单干风”，我们就坚决反对。
    毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”对毛主席的指示，俺贫下中农一千个响应，一万个坚决照办！我们要高举人民公社的伟大红旗，批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，紧跟毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路。
