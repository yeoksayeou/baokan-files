To fully utilize the role of cadres in grasping revolution and promoting production, we conducted an analysis and study of all the cadres in our factory. During the discussion on whether to use a deputy factory director, a debate arose. Some comrades thought this deputy director could be used, while others opposed it. Among those who opposed, some said, "Now we let him return to the leadership position, isn't this handing back the power?"

In response to this issue, everyone sat down again to study Chairman Mao's statements on cadre policy and relevant comments on cadre issues in newspapers and journals. We carefully analyzed the situation of this deputy director and realized that most of his past mistakes were due to issues of style. Although he had executed the bourgeois reactionary line, he had already made a fairly deep self-criticism. Everyone thought that such a leading cadre should be placed in the midst of the masses' struggle to be tested, and should be allowed to play a role in grasping revolution and promoting production. As long as he sincerely corrects his mistakes and stands on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, that would be good. After the discussion, everyone's understanding became consistent, and it was finally decided to include him in the leadership work.

Revolutionary comrades also adopted methods such as heart-to-heart talks and symposiums to help this deputy director, to remove his various doubts about whether the masses trust him and whether he dares to take responsibility, and at the same time actively support his work.

Now, most of the middle-level and above cadres in our factory have been liberated and are working in their respective positions. Some have even become members of the struggle, criticism, and transformation leading groups in various workshops. Some have remained in their leadership positions all along.

    放手让革命干部抓革命促生产
    为了发挥干部在抓革命促生产中的作用，我们对全厂干部进行了分析研究。在讨论能否使用一个副厂长的问题时，引起了争论。有的同志认为这个副厂长可以使用，有的反对。反对的同志中，有的说，“现在又让他回到领导岗位上去，这不是又把权交回去了吗？”
    针对这个问题，大家又坐下来重新学习了毛主席关于干部政策的论述和报刊上有关干部问题的评论，仔细分析了这个副厂长的情况，认识到他过去的错误多数属于作风问题。他虽然执行过资产阶级反动路线，但已作了较深刻的检查。大家认为，象这样的领导干部，应当放到群众斗争中去考验，放手让他在抓革命促生产中发挥作用。只要他认真改正错误，站到毛主席的革命路线上来就好。经过讨论，大家认识一致了，最后决定吸收他参加领导工作。
    革命派同志又采取谈心和座谈等方式，对这个副厂长进行帮助，解除他思想上怕群众不信任、不敢负责的种种疑虑，同时积极支持他工作。
    现在，我们厂的绝大部分中层以上的干部已经解放，都在一定的岗位上工作，有一部分还成为各车间斗批改领导小组的成员。有的人一直留在领导工作岗位上。
