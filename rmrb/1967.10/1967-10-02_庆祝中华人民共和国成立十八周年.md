	The letter of congratulations said: The 18th anniversary of the great People's Republic of China is being celebrated at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led personally by the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has achieved unprecedented victories. This cultural revolution has consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat and thoroughly smashed the illusions of a small handful of people who attempted to restore capitalism in China.

	The letter said: Under the wise leadership of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have built China into a strong bastion of the world's revolutionary people against imperialism and colonialism led by the United States, and against modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership and the reactionaries of various countries. Today's China is the center of the world revolution.

	The letter said: Afro-Asian writers are extremely grateful for the consistent support of Chinese writers and people for the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers. With the firm support of Chinese writers and people, the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference will be held this year in China. This conference will be another milestone in the history of the Afro-Asian writers' movement, which adheres to the guiding line of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought and serves the cause of the Afro-Asian people.

	The letter said: On this historic day, Afro-Asian writers wish to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to you, and through you, to the great writers and people of China, for their assistance to the Afro-Asian writers' movement based on revolutionary internationalism.

	The statement said: Through the cultural revolution, the Chinese people have firmly prevented the emergence of revisionism, greatly strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat in China and most powerfully ensuring that China will never change color. The revolutionary Chinese people have, as always, in the cultural revolution, resolutely and successfully fought against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries. The Afro-Asian people rejoice in this.

	The statement said: The Afro-Asian journalists are greatly pleased to see that China, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is emerging as the strongest and most steadfast bastion of the Afro-Asian people's anti-imperialist struggle, providing the most powerful support to the revolutionary struggle of the Afro-Asian and Latin American peoples for complete national liberation.

	The statement said: The Afro-Asian people will march forward shoulder to shoulder with the brave Chinese people led by the great leader Chairman Mao, completing the historic tasks of the Mao Zedong era, thoroughly smashing imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership, achieving complete national liberation, and advancing towards the victory of socialism worldwide.
