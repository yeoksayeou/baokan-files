In the assistance of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison and stationed troops, large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises such as Shijingshan Power Plant, Beijing Waterworks Company, Changgoutou Coal Mine, and the 2nd Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory have achieved revolutionary unity according to the system, and both revolution and production are in a very good situation.

A large number of large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises have not yet united according to workshops, teams, and departments before National Day. Therefore, various problems that affect the consolidation and development of revolutionary unity continue to occur. The People's Liberation Army soldiers executing the task of supporting the left, based on this situation, further organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and his latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Through study, Chairman Mao's teachings took root in the minds of the broad masses of workers. They vowed to carry out revolutionary unity according to the system as instructed by Chairman Mao, to eliminate factions, to thoroughly revolutionize, and to never give up halfway. Many revolutionary workers deeply felt from practice that carrying out revolutionary unity according to the system is the correct path to achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Immediately, the supporting troops analyzed in detail the various erroneous thoughts that hindered the implementation of revolutionary unity according to the system, and, with "criticize and repudiate revisionism and criticize and repudiate selfishness" as the guideline, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing everyone to engage in the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism. Many workers, with "completely" and "thoroughly" as the standard, voluntarily engaged in self-criticism, exposed their selfish thoughts, struggled against selfishness, and raised their class consciousness. They said, with selfishness, people's hearts are not united, and unity is not tight; with selfishness, there will be competition for positions and the desire to be the "core"; with selfishness, revolutionary unity according to the system cannot be achieved. On this basis, many people quickly returned to their units and carried out revolutionary unity according to workshops, teams, and departments.

Now, in these large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises that have achieved revolutionary unity according to the system, a new situation has universally emerged, and both revolution and production are in a very good situation. Some units have established or are preparing to establish revolutionary committees, and some have established temporary leading bodies for seizing the revolution and promoting production. Units such as Shijingshan Power Plant, Beijing Waterworks Company, Beijing Knitting Factory, and Beijing Garment Factory, from top to bottom, no longer have opposing organizations. The broad masses of workers are all united according to workshops, teams, and departments, studying Chairman Mao's works together; engaging in the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units together; seizing the revolution and promoting production together; and engaging in political activities together. The revolution is booming, and production is rising steadily. After the 2nd Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, Beijing Third Cotton Textile Mill, Changgoutou Coal Mine, and Beijing Instrument Factory achieved revolutionary unity according to the system, everyone firmly guarded their posts, striving to be models for seizing the revolution and promoting production. Wherever there were difficulties, everyone rushed to help. Cooperation between workshops and teams, and between upper and lower processes, was greatly strengthened. The broad revolutionary masses united as one, fought bravely, overcame one difficulty after another, and achieved one victory after another. In recent periods, the production level of Beijing Dyeing Factory has been rising day by day. After Beijing Gear Factory carried out revolutionary unity according to the system, revolutionary workers pooled their wisdom, carried out technological innovations, completed thirteen major technological innovation projects, and the production situation is getting better and better.

    按系统革命大联合有利抓革命促生产
    北京大批大中型工矿企业实现大联合后，革命和生产形势大好
    新华社二十二日讯在人民解放军北京卫戍区和驻京部队支左人员的帮助下，石景山发电厂、北京自来水公司、长沟峪煤矿、二七机车车辆制造厂等大批大型和中型工矿企业单位，遵照毛主席的指示，按照系统实现了革命大联合，革命和生产都呈现出一片大好形势。
    这一大批大型和中型工矿企业，在国庆节前，许多单位还没有按车间、班组、科室系统联合起来。因此，影响巩固和发展革命大联合的各种各样问题还在不断发生。执行支左任务的人民解放军指战员，根据这种情况，进一步组织大家学习毛主席的“老五篇”，学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”通过学习，毛主席的教导在广大工人群众头脑中扎了根。他们表示一定要按毛主席的教导按照系统实行革命大联合，铲除山头，彻底革命，决不半途而废。许多革命职工从实践中深刻地体会到，按系统实行革命大联合，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的正确道路。紧接着，支左人员又具体分析了妨碍按系统实行革命大联合的种种活思想，以“斗私，批修”为纲，开办毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家开展斗私批修活动。许多工人以“完全”“彻底”作标准，自觉开展自我批评，亮私心，斗“私”字，提高了大家的阶级觉悟。他们说，有了“私”字，人心不齐，团结不紧；有了“私”字，就会争席位，当“核心”；有了“私”字，按照系统的革命大联合就搞不成。在这个基础上，许多人迅速回到本单位，按车间、班组、科室实行革命大联合。
    现在，这一大批按系统实现革命大联合的工矿企业，普遍出现了崭新的气象，革命和生产形势一片大好。有的单位建立或正在筹备建立革命委员会，有的建立了抓革命、促生产的临时领导班子。石景山发电厂、北京自来水公司、北京针织总厂、北京被服厂等单位，从上到下，再没有对立的组织，广大职工都是以车间、班组、科室为单位，在一起学习毛主席著作；在一起搞本单位的斗批改；在一起抓革命、促生产；在一起开展政治活动，革命搞得热气腾腾，生产节节上升。二七机车车辆制造厂、北京第三棉纺织厂、长沟峪煤矿和北京仪器厂等单位按系统实现革命大联合以后，人人坚守岗位，争当抓革命、促生产的模范，那里有困难，大家都抢着到那里去，车间与车间、班组与班组，上下工序之间的协作大大加强。广大革命职工齐心协力，英勇奋战，克服了一个又一个困难，取得了一个又一个胜利。北京印染厂最近一个时期，生产水平连日上升。北京齿轮厂，按系统实行革命大联合以后，革命职工群策群力，大搞技术革新，完成了十三项大的技术革新项目，生产形势越来越好。
