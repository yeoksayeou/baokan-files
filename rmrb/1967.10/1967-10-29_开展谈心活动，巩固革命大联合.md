Two opposing revolutionary organizations among the staff of Beijing No. 5 Girls' School—"Destroy Selfishness, Establish Public Spirit" and "Limitless Splendor"—merged to form the "Red Staff" after uniting organizationally. They have since engaged in extensive heart-to-heart talks among comrades, strengthening revolutionary unity.

Study Chairman Mao's Works First, Have Common Language for Heart-to-Heart Talks

Heart-to-heart talks are activities where comrades sit down together to exchange their experiences and insights from studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The "Red Staff" prioritizes the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary unity, the "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," and aphorisms on criticism and self-criticism. They took "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism" as the guiding principle, thoroughly criticized "selfishness," established "public spirit," opposed petty-bourgeois factionalism, and fostered proletarian party spirit. This way, heart-to-heart talks had a clear direction, found ideological weapons, and removed obstacles. Many comrades consciously compared themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings, reviewed their journey during the Cultural Revolution, and summarized experiences and lessons. When comrades mentioned the past "internal wars" during heart-to-heart talks, they felt deeply regretful. They said: "Internal wars" are "private wars." The more they fought, the higher the small hills became, the smaller the circles became, the heavier the private thoughts became, and the greater the harm to the revolution. One comrade, during the work team period, was persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line. After that, she held a grudge against a comrade who had been deceived into executing the bourgeois reactionary line and had thought she would never speak to that comrade again. When that comrade admitted her mistakes and apologized, she refused. During this great unity, she repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and relevant aphorisms on unity, realizing that revolutionary unity is a necessity for the development of the revolutionary situation. She should direct her hatred towards China's Khrushchev, unite with comrades who had been deceived and made mistakes in the past to make revolution, actively promote revolutionary unity, and make Chairman Mao happy, infuriating China's Khrushchev. Thus, with the encouragement of comrades, she bravely visited that comrade's home, shared her experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and proactively proposed to form a "Red Pair" with her. Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, those who were made enemies by the bourgeois reactionary line are now comrades-in-arms fighting side by side.

Heart-to-Heart Talks Must Touch the Soul, Self-Criticism is Essential

Heart-to-heart talks are mass activities of mutual ideological assistance. This mutual assistance mainly relies on self-education and extensive self-criticism. The comrades of the "Red Staff" said well: Self-criticism is self-revolution. One must severely examine one's soul, fight against "selfishness." One must cut off one's braid, expose one's wounds, and settle old accounts that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. The idea that one is always right and others are always wrong must be thoroughly criticized and thrown into the garbage. During heart-to-heart talks, the comrades of the "Red Staff" always first examined their own shortcomings and mistakes. Even when they offered criticism or suggestions to others, they emphasized being objective and did not arbitrarily elevate issues. Because everyone was strict with themselves and lenient with others, sectarianism lost its market, and the atmosphere of unity became increasingly thick. Comrades said: In the past, without self-revolution and self-criticism, always standing on one's own small hill, it always felt that others were lower. Fighting for the fame and profit of one's own small hill, fighting and fighting, gaining "selfishness," losing "public spirit," striking at comrades, letting go of enemies, harming both the revolution and oneself. In the future, we "Red Staff" must, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism" policy, prioritize the revolutionization of thoughts, and let everyone make a revolution in the depths of their souls. Be both a pioneer in "Criticizing Revisionism" and a vanguard in "Fighting Selfishness."

Heart-to-Heart Talks Must Be Heartfelt, Proactively Share Thoughts with Each Other

Heart-to-heart talks are activities where comrades open their hearts to each other. One must proactively share one's true thoughts with the other party. Not talking from the heart and harboring suspicions will not only fail to achieve the purpose of heart-to-heart talks but may even create misunderstandings and increase estrangement.

The comrades of the "Red Staff" have had such lessons. They used to not be able to reach an agreement because they did not trust each other and suspected each other. They would ponder over someone's words or a big-character poster for a long time, always guessing and understanding from the worst possible angle. As a result, no one would speak from the heart, fearing that the other party would seize on it. Over time, mutual suspicions grew larger, and the distance in thoughts became farther. In this way, even a trivial matter could often escalate into a major incident. They learned from past lessons, resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words, "Put the problem on the table," and achieved "open-heartedness," "information sharing," and "mutual understanding."

To achieve this, one must also severely fight against the "selfishness" in one's mind. Because the less private thoughts there are, the deeper the class feelings become, and the more mutual trust there is. One comrade shared how he and a comrade who had been estranged for a long time had a heart-to-heart talk, and how they eliminated suspicions. He said: "At first, when I greeted him and invited him for a heart-to-heart talk, I had a try-it attitude with little confidence. When it came time for the heart-to-heart talk, I made some self-criticisms, saw that the other party spoke cautiously, suspected that he had reservations, and my thoughts wavered. Later, comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, I felt that I had not completely followed Chairman Mao's instructions, did not trust comrades, did not proactively share my thoughts, and did not open my heart to my comrades, how could I expect others to open their hearts to me? Thus, during the next heart-to-heart talk, I frankly shared my thoughts, and the suspicions were quickly eliminated."

### 开展谈心活动，巩固革命大联合

    开展谈心活动，巩固革命大联合
    北京女五中教工中的两个对立的革命组织——“破私立公”和“无限风光”，在组织上联合起来、成立了“红教工”以后，同志之间广泛开展谈心活动，巩固了革命的大联合。	毛主席著作学在先，谈心要有共同语言
    谈心活动，就是坐下来交流活学活用毛主席著作心得体会的活动。“红教工”把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，他们反复学习了毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示、“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和关于批评与自我批评的语录，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破“私”字，大立公字，大反小资产阶级的派性，大树无产阶级的党性。这样，谈心活动便有了明确的方向，找到了思想武器，扫除了障碍。不少同志自觉地对照毛主席的教导，回顾了自己文化大革命以来所走过的路程，总结了经验教训。当同志们在谈心会上一提起过去打
  “内战”的那些事，就感到很痛心。他们说：“内战”就是“私战”，越打小山头越高，越打小圈子越小，越打私心杂念越重，越打对革命损害越大。有个同志，在工作组时期，受到资产阶级反动路线的迫害。此后，她便对一个受蒙蔽执行过资产阶级反动路线的同志抱了成见，曾想一辈子也不和那个同志讲话了。当那个同志检查了错误，并向她赔礼道歉时，她拒绝了。这次大联合中，她反复学习了毛主席的最新指示和有关团结的语录，认识到革命大联合是革命形势发展的需要，自己应该把仇恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫的身上，团结过去受蒙蔽而犯错误的同志一起闹革命，积极促进革命大联合，让毛主席他老人家高兴，气死中国赫鲁晓夫。于是，她在同志们的鼓励下，毅然到那位同志家里去拜访，谈了自己活学活用毛主席著作的体会，主动提出和她结成“一对红”。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，过去被资产阶级反动路线造成的“冤家”，今天又成了并肩战斗的战友。	谈心要触及灵魂，必须多做自我批评
    谈心活动，就是群众性的思想互助活动。这种思想互助，主要是靠自己教育自己，多做自我批评。“红教工”的同志们说得好：自我批评，就是自我革命。要自己狠触灵魂，狠斗“私”字。要自己剪辫子，自己揭疮疤，自己清算那些不符合毛泽东思想的旧账。那种认为自己全对，别人皆错的思想，必须彻底批判，把它扔到垃圾堆里去。“红教工”的同志们在谈心活动中，总是首先检查自己的缺点错误，即使给别人提出批评、意见，也强调实事求是，不随便上纲。由于大家都严以责己，宽以待人，宗派主义就失去了市场，团结的气氛便越来越浓厚。同志们说：过去不搞自我革命，不作自我批评，老是站在自己的小山头上，总觉得别人比自己低。为自己的小山头争名利，争来争去，争来了“私”字，丢掉了“公”字，打击了同志，放过了敌人，既害革命，又害自己。今后，我们“红教工”一定要在毛主席的“斗私，批修”方针指引下，把思想革命化放在首位，人人在自己灵魂深处闹革命，既做“批修”的先锋，又做“斗私”的闯将。	谈心要知心，主动把思想亮给对方
    谈心活动，就是同志间的交心活动。要主动把自己的真实思想亮给对方。不谈心里话，互存戒心，不仅达不到谈心的目的，甚至会产生误会，增加隔阂。
    “红教工”的同志们，就有过这样的教训。他们过去一直谈不拢，就是因为互不信任，互相猜疑。对别人一句话，一张大字报，总要捉摸老半天，专从坏的方面去猜测、理解。结果，谁也不说心里话，深怕对方抓辫子。久而久之，互相间的戒心越来越大，思想上的距离越来越远。这样，那怕是芝麻大的事，也常常会酿成轩然大波。他们吸取了以往的教训，坚决听毛主席的话，“把问题摆到桌面上来”，做到“襟怀坦白”，“互通情报”，“互相谅解”。
    要做到这点，也必须狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。因为私心少了，阶级感情就深了，互相间的信任也就多了。有个同志介绍自己和一个隔阂了很久的同志谈心，怎样消除猜疑的体会时说：“最初，我打招呼和他相约谈心时，是抱着试一试的态度，信心不大。到了谈心的时候，自己作了些自我批评，一看对方说话谨慎，怀疑他有戒心，思想就动摇了。后来，用毛主席的教导一对照，觉得自己首先就没有完全照毛主席的指示办事，对同志不信任，没主动亮自己的思想，没有向自己的同志交心，怎能希望别人向你交心呢？于是，在下一次谈心会上，自己干脆把心里话说了，结果疑团也就很快消除了。”　　　			　（任卫东）
