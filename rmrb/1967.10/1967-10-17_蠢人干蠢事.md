U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara recently announced that the U.S. government will establish a "barrier zone" south of the demilitarized zone in Vietnam by the end of this year or early next year. It is said that in this area, which is about 43 miles long and 600 feet wide, there will be extremely complex devices including barbed wire, landmines, and electronic alarms. The U.S. imperialists arrogantly hope to use this to prevent the infiltration of the people of North Vietnam into South Vietnam. U.S. newspapers boast that this is a "major policy decision" by the U.S. government. In fact, this is just a foolish and clumsy move by the U.S. ruling class, who are at their wits' end on the Vietnam battlefield and have come up with a wild idea.

In the Vietnam War, U.S. imperialism has long pursued a policy of "fighting in the south and bombing in the north." What has been the result? Five hundred thousand U.S. aggressors, using all modern weapons except the atomic bomb, still cannot escape the passive situation of being beaten in South Vietnam. The so-called "inkblot strategy," "helicopter strategy," and other schemes concocted by the strategists at the Pentagon have all failed. The "offensives" they launched have all ended in complete failure. The flames of the people's war are burning more fiercely in South Vietnam, scorching the intruding American bull until it is in a desperate situation. The U.S. ruling class actually thinks that by building a "barrier zone" outside and closing the door, it can save itself from being burned to death. Isn't this just a pipe dream?

In North Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has been carrying out escalating bombing, dropping thousands of tons of bombs, in an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. Now, the so-called "air superiority" that U.S. imperialism boasts of has been shattered in North Vietnam. Their conspiracy with the Soviet revisionists to talk about "peace" has also ended in a shameful failure. Thus, they attempt to rely on a "barrier zone" or a "wall" to stop the support of the people of North Vietnam to their southern kin. This is a truly desperate trick!

The Vietnamese nation is a whole. Vietnam is the territory of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people have every right and every means to act freely on their own land. Not to mention a "wall," even ten such "walls" would absolutely not stop the people of North Vietnam from fully supporting their southern kin.

Imperialism and all reactionaries have always believed in weapons, thinking that weapons are all-powerful. They detach themselves from the people and look down on the power of the people. This is the fundamental reason why they are stupid and will inevitably fail. Such fools will never understand that the real iron wall is the people, which no counter-revolutionary can break through. And the "wall" that McNamara wants to build, no matter how many electric nets and landmines it uses, is just a mud "wall" that will fall with a push in the face of the revolutionary people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The most die-hard elements of the exploiting classes will never admit their defeat. This is because they need not only to deceive others but also to deceive themselves; otherwise, they cannot go on living."

The so-called "McNamara barrier zone" is an action by U.S. imperialism to deceive both others and itself. It reflects the desperate situation faced by the U.S. ruling class due to the failure of the Vietnam War. Even American journalist Alsop had to admit that the establishment of the "barrier zone" is purely "armchair strategizing," and the hype it has caused is "utterly ignorant and pathetic." In the face of the raging flames of the Vietnamese people's war, McNamara's "barrier zone" will inevitably become a "death zone" for the U.S. military, further accelerating the complete failure of the American aggressors.

　　蠢人干蠢事
    美国国防部长麦克纳马拉最近宣布，美国政府将于今年底或明年初，在越南非军事区以南建立一个“障碍地带”。据说，在这个长约四十三英里、宽约六百英尺的地区，将有包括铁丝网、地雷和电子警报等非常复杂的装置。美帝国主义妄图以此阻止越南北方人民向越南南方的所谓“渗透”。美国报刊吹嘘，这是美国政府的“一项重大政策决定”。其实，这不过是美国统治集团在越南战场上黔驴技穷，异想天开地施出的蠢笨的一招。
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中，长期实行所谓南打北炸的方针。结果如何呢？五十万的美国侵略军，使用了除原子弹以外的所有现代化武器，仍然无法摆脱他们在南越战场上被动挨揍的处境。五角大楼的战略家们绞尽脑汁想出来的什么“墨迹战略”，什么“直升飞机战略”等等，统统失灵。他们发动的这个“攻势”那个“攻势”，也都以彻底失败而告终。人民战争的烈火正在南越战场上越烧越猛，把美国侵略者这只乱闯的野牛烧得焦头烂额。美国统治集团竟然以为在外面筑一道什么“障碍地带”，把大门关起来，就可以挽救它最后被烧死的命运，这不是白日做梦吗？
    在越南北方，美帝国主义进行逐步升级的狂轰滥炸，投下了成千成万吨炸弹，妄图迫使越南人民屈服。现在，美帝国主义吹嘘的“空中优势”在越南北方被打碎了。他们和苏修串通一起搞的什么“和谈”阴谋，也遭到了可耻的破产。于是，它企图乞灵于“障碍地带”或者一道“墙”，来阻止越南北方人民对自己南方骨肉同胞的支援。真是穷极无聊的把戏！
    越南民族是一个整体。越南是越南人民的国土。越南人民在自己的国土上，有一切权利和一切办法自由行动。别说是一道“墙”，就是十道这样的“墙”，也绝对阻止不了越南北方人民对他们南方同胞的全力支援。
    帝国主义和一切反动派，从来迷信武器，以为武器万能。他们脱离人民，瞧不起人民的力量，这就是他们之所以愚蠢、并且必然遭到最后失败的根本原因。这一类蠢人永远也不能理解，真正的铜墙铁壁是人民，是任何反革命所攻不破的。而麦克纳马拉所要筑的“墙”，不管它使用多少电网和地雷，在革命的人民面前，都不过是一堵一推就倒的土“墙”而已。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：剥削阶级中的“最死硬分子是永远不会承认他们的失败的。这是因为他们不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。”
    渲染一时的所谓“麦克纳马拉的障碍地带”，就是美帝国主义用来欺骗别人也欺骗自己的行动。它反映了美国统治集团由于侵越战争的失败所面临的狼狈处境。连美国记者艾尔索普都不得不承认，建立“障碍地带”完全是“纸上谈兵”，它所引起的渲染是“十足可悲的无知”。在越南人民战争烈火越烧越旺的情况下，麦克纳马拉的“障碍地带”必将成为美军的“死亡地带”，只会更加速美国侵略者的彻底失败。
