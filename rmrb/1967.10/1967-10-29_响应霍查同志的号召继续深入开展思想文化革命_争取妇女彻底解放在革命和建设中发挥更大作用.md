The Sixth National Congress of the Albanian Women's Union Opens Solemnly

In response to Comrade Ho Chi Minh's call, continue to deepen the ideological and cultural revolution, strive for the complete liberation of women, and play a greater role in revolution and construction. Comrade Ho Chi Minh and other party and government leaders, such as Shehu and List, attended the congress. Vito Kapo gave a speech, enthusiastically praising our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

NEW YORK, October 27 - The Sixth National Congress of the Albanian Women's Union opened solemnly on the morning of October 25 at the "Partisan" Sports Hall in Tirana.

The beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and other party and government leaders, including Shehu and List, attended the congress. When Comrade Hoxha and other party and government leaders entered the venue accompanied by the chairman of the Albanian Women's Union, Vito Kapo, the entire audience stood up and enthusiastically shouted, "Labor Party! Enver Hoxha! The Labor Party, Enver, we are always ready!"

The congress was attended by 1,850 representatives from all over the country, including guerrilla fighters who participated in the Albanian national liberation war, mothers of martyrs, active members of the socialist construction front, and revolutionary pioneers who emerged in the revolutionary movement. More than an hour before the congress began, the representatives had already arrived at the venue, enthusiastically cheering for the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, who led them forward, and singing revolutionary songs such as "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun." Under the inspiration and guidance of the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha's series of important instructions, they were determined to continue to deepen the ideological and cultural revolution of changing customs and establishing new ones, strive for the complete liberation of Albanian women, and make Albanian women play a greater role in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The congress was presided over by Nechmiye Hoxha, a member of the Albanian Women's Union Council. Vito Kapo made a report on the first agenda item of the congress, "On the Work of the National Council of the Albanian Women's Union and the Implementation of the Resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the Albanian Labor Party on the Complete Liberation of Women and the Improvement of Their Role in Socialist Society."

In the morning session on October 25, Baluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee. Baluku's speech was repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause and cheers from the entire audience, who repeatedly stood up and shouted, "Labor Party! Enver Hoxha! The Labor Party, Enver, we are always ready!" This fully demonstrated the iron-like unity between the Albanian women and the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Hoxha, as well as their firm resolve to implement the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and successfully complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

In her report, Vito Kapo first pointed out that it has been almost a year since the historic Fifth National Congress of the Albanian Labor Party was held. This congress formulated a grand program to persist in continuous revolution, build a socialist society, and further revolutionize our country's life, as well as to block the road to the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism. Over the past year, our entire people have better demonstrated their creativity, willpower, pioneering spirit, courage, and selflessness, thus proving that the party's words are the people's actions.

The revolutionary movement that has been launched among the people, aiming to develop production, temper people ideologically in the struggle against thoughts that are incompatible with us, defeat the blockade of imperialist-revisionists, and hold high the unsullied banner of Marxism-Leninism in this corner of Europe, has been vividly reflected in the Fifth National Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and the subsequent preparation process of the congresses of all mass organizations. It shows that the party and the people are closely connected, that the people's hearts beat with the party's heart, and that the people, like the party that gives them life and inspires their thoughts, will be immortal.

Our Sixth National Congress is held in such a situation where, under the call of the party and Comrade Hoxha, the entire people take bold actions to further revolutionize life in all aspects and rise up to burn with fire the various customs and remnants that lower the status of women. At this congress, Albanian women pledge to the party and Comrade Hoxha that Albanian women will, as always, be unyielding warriors to turn the Fourth Five-Year Plan into reality and vanguard warriors in the great struggle for the complete liberation of women. This is based on the words of Comrade Hoxha, who said, "The complete liberation of women is one of the decisive factors in creating the most suitable conditions for building socialism and communism and forging and tempering new people of socialism."

The great thoughts of the Fifth National Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, as well as Comrade Hoxha's programmatic speeches on women's issues, are the red line running through our congress work and the guiding principles and programs for our future work. These great thoughts are the summary of our party's work experience and the creative implementation of Marxism-Leninism under the specific conditions of our country.

She then elaborated in her report on the great contributions of Albanian women during the national liberation war, the active participation of Albanian women in the socialist revolution and socialist construction under the guidance of the party and Comrade Hoxha, the enthusiastic promotion of the ideological and cultural revolution of changing old customs and establishing new ones, the importance of striving for the complete liberation of women, and the future tasks of struggle.

She said, Albanian women are proud of the path they have experienced, happy with the victories they have achieved, and proud to have such a party that has saved Albanian women from the darkness of the Middle Ages, through sharp class struggle and great turning points, as well as profound revolutionary changes, and led them onto the path of complete liberation.

In the 23 years since the establishment of the people's government, the lives of women in our country have undergone fundamental changes. Women, like all the people, have forever rid themselves of oppression and exploitation. Women actively participate in production activities and the political, social, and cultural life of the state. The doors to education and culture have been opened wide for women. The new women of socialist Albania are resolutely fighting to smash old reactionary thoughts and strive for the victory of socialist thoughts.

She said, the problem of liberating women is arduous and complex. It has economic, social, and ideological aspects, and today the ideological aspect is the most important. Today, the struggle to smash the conservative, superstitious, and feudal-bourgeois thoughts that have dominated for generations is the struggle for the complete victory of the party's thoughts on women's issues. The report of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee pointed out: "The deepening of the movement for the complete liberation of women in the ideological aspect, the increasingly profound understanding of the problem of liberating women by Communist Party members and all laborers, is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the tasks proposed by the party on women's issues." Standing at the forefront of this profound ideological struggle are the working class, which initiates and leads various political movements and imbues these movements with class spirit, the successors of the cause of our young generation and those who participated in the national liberation struggle and laid the foundation for socialism. Albanian women, with their sublime and pure spiritual appearance, party spirit, and socialist patriotism, stand with them.

The party and Comrade Hoxha teach us that without the initiative of women in the work of power and production, there will be no revolutionization of production, no revolutionization of power, no mass line, and no socialist democracy. Without opposing the thoughts and habits that lower the status of women, true equality between men and women cannot be achieved. The struggle against the thoughts and habits that lower the status of women is a class struggle between our party's thoughts and feudal-bourgeois thoughts, between the socialism that is victorious in our country and the backward remnants of the exploiting classes that attempt to maintain and restore the past.

Under the brilliant guidance of the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the party and Comrade Hoxha's programmatic speech on February 6, the entire people have risen up in unison. According to these documents, every laborer in our country is like looking in a mirror, deeply feeling that they should participate in the struggle for the complete liberation of women. The entire people have joined the movement, and everyone has begun to consider how to promote the solution to this major issue. Women work and struggle to realize the party's general line in the economic, political, and ideological aspects, actively participate in the movement and our country's great revolutionary initiatives at present, which helps to gradually solve their own problems and ensure their complete liberation. This is a process that will continue to develop over a long period of time, and we must deepen and carry it out to the end.

She said, without struggle, old norms will not easily give way to new thoughts and customs born in the new production relations. Therefore, we have never expected to obtain new things in a spontaneous manner. To further deepen the struggle for the victory of new things, all women must deeply understand the class nature of the backward customs that weigh more heavily on women than on men, and arm themselves with the Marxist-Leninist worldview on the class of women.

We must understand that the ideological struggle for the liberation of women is comprehensive and complex. It is not only a struggle against feudal, patriarchal, and religious influences, but also a struggle against various incompatible reactionary views, especially against the tenacious small-bourgeois and bourgeois thoughts. Therefore, it is a great class struggle that must be vigorously developed in the mountains, plains, villages, and cities.

Nothing old will disappear by itself, and without struggle, it will not surrender, let alone deeply rooted and class-based concepts and customs.

Of course, the new women will not easily or without effort fulfill their rights and achieve their due position in our society, but they will have to struggle and truly overcome difficulties and obstacles to pave the way for new things. This struggle is essentially a class struggle, a struggle for the victory of proletarian revolutionary thoughts and the destruction of reactionary bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts. We believe that in the future, women will also be able to struggle, overcome all subjective and objective, their own and others' difficulties and obstacles, and women will struggle and win because in this struggle, which is of historical significance to us and our country's future, they have the full support of our revolutionary Labor Party and our respected leader, Comrade Hoxha.

In the final part of her report, Vito Kapo expressed that Albanian women resolutely support the foreign policy of the People's Republic of Albania and strive to fulfill the tasks assigned by the party in this regard.

She said, Albanian women are fully committed and wholeheartedly support the foreign policy of our country, which is so wise and firm, formulated by the party and Comrade Hoxha.

The Albanian people and women are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the great people of seven hundred million China—the brave Chinese women. Our people have formed an eternal friendship with them. The great people of China, who are always loyal to proletarian internationalism, are dedicated to the cause of world revolution. They are a great inspiration and example for the people of all countries who oppose imperialism, colonialism, and modern revisionism, and they have rich experience. The Chinese people faithfully implement the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong on Marxism-Leninism, taking the fate of the Chinese revolution and proletarian dictatorship into their own hands. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong is a new type of revolution, a new and higher stage of the socialist revolution. As our party has always said, we believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest victory achieved by the great Chinese people after the victory of the armed revolution that led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It is of great significance not only to the brotherly Chinese people but also to the revolutionary people of all countries and to the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. Therefore, on behalf of Albanian women, we enthusiastically congratulate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is a victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, a victory of revolution over counter-revolution, and a victory of socialism over capitalism. We are genuinely happy for the great victories achieved by the great Chinese people and congratulate the Chinese people on further achievements in all fronts.

The Albanian people and the Chinese people have formed a great, unbreakable friendship. This friendship was forged by our two parties and the two great leaders, Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong, in the flames of the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The visit of the Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to the People's Republic of China is a new contribution to further strengthening the friendship between our two peoples.

Let the imperialist and revisionist enemies bark all they want! Great China will not change its red color. They will be the reliable pillars of all revolutionary forces in the world, of Vietnam, and of all liberation movements until the final victory. Comrade Hoxha's high evaluation of the role and position of the Chinese people in the entire revolutionary force line at the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front is also the evaluation of the people of all countries. Comrade Hoxha said: "The iron-like unity of all Marxist-Leninist forces and revolutionary forces in the world with the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China is of historical significance to the fate of revolution, socialism, and the freedom of the people of all countries."

Dear comrades, allow me to use this platform to express our heartfelt respect to all Chinese women who have become an inspiration to all revolutionary women in the world through their struggle. We assure them that Albanian women will protect our revolutionary friendship as we protect our eyes and will forever march forward together on the road to socialism and communism.

Vito Kapo expressed that Albanian women resolutely support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation, resolutely support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and strongly condemn the collusion and conspiracy between the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. She said, the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership is so despicable. In the Vietnamese issue, the surrender policy of the Khrushchev revisionists has reached a new peak. Here, more than anywhere else, their double-dealing and two-faced stance is exposed. They condemn American aggression verbally, but in action, they expand cooperation with the aggressors. On the one hand, they loudly proclaim support for the Vietnamese people and their liberation struggle, but on the other hand, they spare no effort to bring the Vietnamese issue onto the track of "peaceful solution" and diplomatic negotiations.

Every escalation of the American war will inevitably lead to a new escalation of the Moscow-Washington collusion. The meeting between Johnson and Kosygin in Glassboro and the draft of the Soviet-American treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons itself proves this. The current attitude of the Kremlin leaders in international issues best illustrates that they have trampled on the best traditions of the foreign policy of the Soviet state formed in the era of Lenin and Stalin, and have finally fallen into the old diplomatic swamp of the bourgeoisie, into the swamp of vile intrigue diplomacy, unprincipled compromise, plunder and division, hypocrisy, and betrayal, betraying the peoples and revolutions of various countries. Now, the peoples of the world are well aware that without opposing the product of imperialism—the modern revisionism led by the Soviet Khrushchev leadership—it is impossible to successfully oppose imperialism. In order to strengthen the "holy alliance" with the United States, the Soviet revisionists are trading the interests of the peoples of various countries and are colluding with Pope Paul VI in this activity. The target of this "alliance" is aimed at the revolutionary peoples of various countries who are holding high the banner of freedom and democratic revolution, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Republic of Albania. But the people are invincible. Albania and China faithfully follow the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and will live and prosper. The truth is on the side of China and Albania, and the people of the world stand with China and Albania.

Vito Kapo also condemned that the International Democratic Women's Federation has degenerated into a tool of modern revisionism. She said, the International Democratic Women's Federation has long become a branch of the Soviet diplomatic followers and the foreign ministry of the Kremlin. In all its activities, its entire stance reflects the line of the Soviet Union. Revolutionary women around the world will never compromise with the modern revisionist leaders of the International Democratic Women's Federation, will not take responsibility for joint actions with these traitors, imperialist and revisionist running dogs, because they have betrayed the interests of revolutionary women around the world.

Vito Kapo finally said, we are fully aware that the road to building socialism will not be as smooth as a green lawn or a broad avenue paved with asphalt. We will never forget that we live and work under the encirclement of imperialism and revisionism. The imperialist and revisionist conspirators have not given up their plots to restore the old capitalist system in our country. Even the Greek royal fascists are dreaming during the day, attempting to threaten the territorial integrity of our republic. The barking of mad dogs will not stop the advance of the team. The team will continue to march forward. We are closely united around our brave party led by our beloved leader, Comrade Hoxha, and we are the masters of the motherland. Our victories are sacred and inviolable.

We Albanian women are a powerful force, the force of the party. Whether in peaceful days or stormy days, we will always be ready. As soon as the party gives the order, as soon as Comrade Hoxha gives the order, we will all be mobilized, take up arms, and fight to defend the country, defend socialism, and defend the revolution.

    阿尔巴尼亚妇女联合会第六次代表大会隆重开幕
    响应霍查同志的号召继续深入开展思想文化革命
    争取妇女彻底解放在革命和建设中发挥更大作用
    霍查同志以及谢胡、列希等党政领导同志出席了大会
    维托·卡博作报告，热情赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚妇女联合会第六次代表大会二十五日上午在地拉那“游击队”体育馆隆重开幕。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查以及其他党政领导人谢胡、列希等出席了大会。当霍查等党政领导同志在阿尔巴尼亚妇联主席维托·卡博等陪同下步入会场的时候，全场起立，长时间地热烈高呼：“劳动党！”“恩维尔·霍查！”“劳动党，恩维尔，我们时刻准备着！”
    出席代表大会的有来自全国各地的一千八百五十名代表，她们当中有参加过阿尔巴尼亚民族解放战争的游击队员、烈士母亲、社会主义建设战线上的积极分子和在革命化运动中涌现出来的革命闯将。早在大会开始前一个多小时，代表们就来到会场，热烈欢呼领导她们奋勇前进的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志，纵情欢唱《一手拿镐，一手拿枪》等革命歌曲。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议和霍查同志一系列重要指示的鼓舞和照耀下，她们决心继续深入开展移风易俗、破旧立新的思想文化革命，为争取阿尔巴尼亚妇女的彻底解放而不断奋斗，使阿尔巴尼亚妇女在社会主义革命、社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用。
    大会由阿尔巴尼亚妇联理事会理事涅奇米叶·霍查主持。妇联主席维托·卡博就大会的第一项议程在会上作了“关于阿尔巴尼亚妇联全国理事会的工作和贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会关于彻底解放妇女和提高她们在社会主义社会中的作用的决议的报告”。　　
    在二十五日上午的会议上，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员巴卢库代表党中央向大会致贺词。巴卢库的讲话不断被全场暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声所打断，全体代表一再起立高呼“劳动党！”“恩维尔·霍查”和“劳动党，恩维尔，我们时刻准备着！”充分表现了阿尔巴尼亚妇女和以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的钢铁般团结以及为贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议、胜利完成第四个五年计划的坚强决心。
    维托·卡博在报告中首先指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党具有历史意义的第五次代表大会召开以后已快一年了。这次大会制定了坚持不断革命、建成社会主义社会和使我国生活进一步革命化，以及堵塞产生修正主义和复辟资本主义倾向的道路的宏伟纲领。这一年来，我国全体人民更好地表现出创造性的生命力、毅力、首创精神、勇敢和忘我精神，从而证明了党的话就是人民的行动。
    在人民中掀起的旨在发展生产，在反对同我们格格不入的思想残余的斗争中从思想上锻炼人，胜利击败帝修的封锁，在欧洲的这个角落高举不容沾污的马克思列宁主义旗帜的革命运动，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上和代表大会以后，在群众组织的所有代表大会的准备过程中所热烈表现出的对党的热爱和人民的决心，以及这次代表大会召开的本身，说明党和人民的联系非常之好，说明人民的心是同党的心一起跳动的，说明人民就象党赋予人民生命和鼓舞人民的思想一样永垂不朽。
    我们第六次代表大会是在这样的形势下召开的，即全体人民在党和霍查同志的号召下，采取勇敢的行动，使各方面的生活进一步革命化，起来用火焚烧降低妇女人格的各种习俗和残余。阿尔巴尼亚妇女在这次代表大会的讲台上向党和霍查同志保证，阿尔巴尼亚妇女将一如既往地成为把第四个五年计划变为现实的不屈不挠的战士，作彻底解放妇女的伟大战斗中的先锋战士，这是根据霍查同志所说的话考虑出发的，霍查同志说，“彻底解放妇女是为建成社会主义和共产主义的新的一代创造最适当的条件，造就和锻炼社会主义新人的决定性因素之一。”
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第十一次全会，以及霍查同志关于妇女问题的纲领性的讲话的伟大思想，是贯穿我们代表大会工作的一条红线，是我们今后工作的指南和纲领。这一伟大的思想是我们党的工作经验和在我国的具体条件下创造性地执行马克思列宁主义的理论总结。
    她接着在报告中详细谈到了阿尔巴尼亚妇女在民族解放战争时期的巨大贡献、阿尔巴尼亚妇女在党和霍查同志的指引下积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设、踊跃开展破旧立新的思想文化革命、争取彻底解放妇女的重要意义和今后的战斗任务等问题。
    她说，阿尔巴尼亚妇女为自己经历的道路而自豪，为取得的胜利而高兴，为有这样一个把阿尔巴尼亚妇女从中世纪的黑暗中拯救出来，通过尖锐的阶级斗争和巨大的转折以及深刻的革命变革，使妇女走上彻底解放的道路的党感到自豪。
    在人民政权建立的二十三年来，我国妇女的生活中发生了根本性的变化，妇女象全体人民一样永远地摆脱了压迫和剥削；妇女积极参加生产活动和国家的政治的、社会的文化生活；为妇女打开了教育和文化的所有大门。社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的新妇女坚决为粉碎旧的反动的思想，争取社会主义思想的胜利而斗争。
    她说，解放妇女的问题是艰巨和复杂的。它有经济的方面，社会的方面和思想的方面，而今天思想方面的问题居第一位。今天，为粉碎世世代代以来占统治地位的保守、迷信和封建资产阶级思想的斗争，就是争取党关于妇女问题的思想完全胜利的斗争。党中央第十一次全会的报告指出：“彻底解放妇女的运动在思想方面的深入，共产党员和全体劳动者越来越深刻地理解解放妇女的问题，是党在妇女问题上所提出的任务得到胜利解决的最可靠的保证。”站在这场深刻的思想斗争第一线的，是发动和领导各种政治运动并赋予这些运动以阶级精神的工人阶级，我们的年青一代和参加过民族解放斗争并奠定了社会主义基础的人们的事业的继承者。有着崇高和纯洁的精神面貌、党性和社会主义爱国主义特点的阿尔巴尼亚妇女同他们站在一起。
    党和霍查同志教导我们，没有妇女在政权和生产工作中的积极性，就没有生产的革命化，就没有政权的革命化，就没有群众路线，就没有社会主义民主。不反对那种降低妇女人格的思想和习惯，就不能达到男女之间的真正平等。反对降低妇女人格的思想和习惯的斗争，是在我们党的思想和封建—资产阶级思想之间，是正在我国取得胜利的社会主义和企图保持并恢复过去的剥削阶级的落后残余之间进行的阶级斗争。
    在党的第五次代表大会的决议和霍查同志二月六日的纲领性的讲话的光辉照耀下，整个人民群众都一致奋起。根据这些文件，我国的每个劳动者象是对照了一下镜子，深刻地感到应该参加彻底解放妇女的斗争。全体人民都投入了运动，大家都开始考虑，怎样去促进这个重大问题的解决。妇女为实现党在经济、政治和思想方面的总路线而工作和斗争，积极地参加运动和我国目前伟大的革命倡议，有助于逐步地解决她们自己的问题，保证她们的彻底解放。这是在一个长时间内继续发展的过程，我们必须深入开展并把它进行到底。
    她说，不通过斗争，旧的准则不会轻易让位于在新的生产关系中诞生的新思想和新习俗。因此，我们从来都不期望以自发的方式获得新事物。为了进一步深入争取新事物胜利的斗争，全体妇女应当深刻理解那种压在妇女身上，比压在男子身上更重的落后习俗的阶级性，以马克思列宁主义关于妇女的阶级的世界观武装自己。
    我们必须懂得，解放妇女的思想斗争是全面的和复杂的。它不仅仅是同封建的、宗法的和宗教的思想影响进行搏斗，而且也是同形形色色的格格不入的反动观点、特别是同还很顽强的小资产阶级和资产阶级思想的影响进行搏斗。因此，它是一场巨大的阶级搏斗，必须在山区、平原、乡村和城市中大力地加以发展。
    任何旧东西都不会自行消灭，不经过斗争，它是不投降的，更不用说根深蒂固的和有阶级根源的观念和习俗了。
    当然，新妇女将要履行自己的权利，取得在我们社会当中应有的地位，并不会轻而易举或不经努力的，而是要经过努力，经过真正克服困难和障碍的斗争才能为新事物开辟道路。这种斗争实质上是一场阶级斗争，是为争取工人阶级革命思想的胜利和摧毁资产阶级和小资产阶级反动思想的一场斗争。我们相信，在今后，妇女也将善于斗争，战胜一切主观的或客观的、自己的或别人的困难和障碍，妇女将进行斗争并取得胜利，因为在这场对我们和我们国家未来具有历史意义的斗争中，她们有我们革命的劳动党和我们尊敬的领袖霍查同志的全力支持。
    维托·卡博在报告的最后一部分中，表示阿尔巴尼亚妇女坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的对外政策并为胜任党在这方面规定的任务而奋斗。
    她说，阿尔巴尼亚妇女全力以赴、一心支持党和霍查同志如此英明坚定地制订的我国的对外政策。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和妇女感到骄傲的是和伟大的七亿中国人民——英勇的中国妇女并肩站在一起。我国人民同他们结成了永恒的友谊。永远忠于无产阶级国际主义的伟大的中国人民，致全力于世界革命事业。它是反对帝国主义、殖民主义和现代修正主义的各国人民的伟大的鼓舞榜样，它有丰富的经验。中国人民忠实地贯彻毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义教导，把中国革命和无产阶级专政的命运掌握在自己的手里。由伟大的领袖毛泽东同志领导的无产阶级文化大革命是一场新型的革命，是社会主义革命新的更高的阶段。正如我们党一贯所说的，我们认为无产阶级文化大革命是继导致中华人民共和国成立的武装革命胜利之后伟大的中国人民所取得的最伟大的胜利。它不仅对兄弟的中国人民，而且对一切国家的革命人民，对反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争，都具有重大意义。因此，我们代表阿尔巴尼亚妇女，在此大会上，热烈祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命，它是无产阶级对资产阶级的胜利，是革命对反革命的胜利，是社会主义对资本主义的胜利。我们为伟大的中国人民所取得的胜利而由衷地高兴，并祝贺中国人民在各个战线上进一步取得越来越大的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民结成了伟大的牢不可破的友谊。这一友谊是由我们两党和两位伟大的领袖霍查同志和毛泽东同志在反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争烈火中缔造的。以谢胡同志为首的我国党政代表团在中华人民共和国的访问，是对进一步加强我们两国人民之间的友谊的一个新的贡献。
    让帝国主义、修正主义敌人去狂叫吧！伟大的中国不会改变她的鲜红颜色，它们将是世界一切革命力量、越南和一切解放运动的直到最后胜利的可靠支柱。霍查同志在民主阵线第四次代表大会上对中国人民在整个革命力量阵线中所起作用和所占有地位的高度评价也是各国人民的评价。霍查同志说：“世界一切马克思列宁主义力量和革命力量同中国共产党和中华人民共和国的钢铁般的团结，是对革命、社会主义和各国人民自由的命运有着历史意义的客观的必须。”
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我借此讲台，向以自己的斗争成为世界一切革命妇女的鼓舞榜样的全体中国妇女表示衷心的敬意。我们向她们保证，阿尔巴尼亚妇女将象保护眼睛一样地保护我们的革命友谊，将永远一起沿着社会主义和共产主义的大道向前迈进。
    维托·卡博表示，阿尔巴尼亚妇女坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放斗争，并强烈谴责美帝和苏修互相勾结，狼狈为奸，妄图破坏各国人民的革命斗争。她说，苏修领导集团的背叛是多么卑鄙。在越南问题上赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的投降政策达到了新的顶峰。这里比任何地方都更明显地暴露了他的双重作用和两面三刀的立场。他们口头上也谴责美国侵略，而行动上扩大与侵略者的合作。他们一方面大吹大擂说支持越南人民，支持越南人民的解放斗争，另一方面不惜一切地要把越南问题纳入“和平解决”的轨道上去，纳入外交谈判的轨道上去。
    美国的每一战争升级必定导致莫斯科华盛顿勾结的新升级。约翰逊和柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的会见和苏美防止核扩散条约草案本身就说明了这点。克里姆林宫现领导人在国际问题中的态度最好不过地说明了他们践踏了苏维埃国家在列宁、斯大林时代就已形成的对外政策方面的最优良的传统，他们最终地陷入了资产阶级旧的外交泥坑里去了，陷入了卑鄙的阴谋外交，无原则的妥协、掠夺分赃、虚伪和背信弃义的泥坑里去了，背叛了各国人民和革命。现在世界各国人民都很清楚，不反对帝国主义的产物——以苏联赫鲁晓夫领导人为首的现代修正主义就不能顺利地反对帝国主义。为了加强与美国的“神圣同盟”，苏联修正主义者拿各国人民的利益作交易，并在此活动中与教皇保罗六世进行勾结。这一“联盟”的矛头针对着高举自由和民主革命旗帜的各国革命人民、中华人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。但是人民是不可战胜的。阿尔巴尼亚和中国忠实地遵循马克思列宁主义学说，将生活和繁荣下去，真理是在中国和阿尔巴尼亚方面，全世界人民群众同中国和阿尔巴尼亚站在一起。
    维托·卡博还谴责国际妇联已堕落成为现代修正主义的工具。她说，国际民主妇联早已成为苏联外交追随者和克里姆林宫外交部的一个分支机构。在它的一切活动中，它的整个立场都体现了苏联的路线。全世界的革命妇女永远不会与国际民主妇联修正主义头子妥协，不承担和这些叛徒、帝国主义和修正主义走狗共同进行勾当的责任，因为她们背叛了世界革命妇女的利益。
    维托·卡博最后说，我们完全意识到，建设社会主义的道路决不会象绿茵茵的草地或柏油铺成的广场那样平坦的。我们任何时候都不会忘记我们是在帝国主义和修正主义包围下生活和劳动的。合谋侵略的帝国主义和修正主义并没有放弃在我国恢复资本主义旧制度的阴谋。还有希腊保皇法西斯分子也在白日做梦，妄图威胁我们共和国的领土的完整。狂犬的吠声是阻挡不了队伍的前进的。队伍将继续前进。我们紧密团结在以我们敬爱的领袖霍查同志为首的我们英勇的党的周围，我们是祖国的主人。我们的胜利是神圣不可侵犯的。
    我们阿尔巴尼亚妇女是一支强大的队伍，是党的队伍。不管是在平静的日子里还是在暴风雨的日子里，我们都将时刻准备着，只要党一声令下，只要霍查同志一声令下，我们将会全部动员，拿起武器，为保卫国家、保卫社会主义和保卫革命而战。
