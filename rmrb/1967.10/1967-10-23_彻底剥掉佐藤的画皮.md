The reactionary Prime Minister of Japan, Eisaku Sato, has been busy with counterrevolutionary activities in Asia and the Pacific region over the past few months. From October 8 to 21, he visited Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and South Vietnam to engage in conspiratorial activities. Sato, jumping around, acts as if he is the "manager" of American imperialism in Asia, fiercely anti-China, directly interfering in the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and conspiring with the reactionaries in Asia and the Pacific to suppress the revolutionary movements of the Asian people.

Since the war, it is the first time a Japanese Prime Minister has made such a wide-ranging visit. This marks the stage where the Japanese reactionaries are more actively participating in the U.S. strategy of invading Asia in political, economic, and military aspects. It also marks the stage where Japanese militarism, with the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is launching a larger-scale invasion and expansion into Asia and the Pacific.

Currently, the situation of U.S. imperialism in Asia is becoming increasingly dire. It is being beaten badly in the Vietnam War, in a desperate and chaotic state. Its bases of aggression in Asia are undergoing fundamental shakeups. In this situation, U.S. imperialism urgently needs its largest lackey in Asia, the Japanese reactionaries, to help it out. Sato's trip this time is precisely following the instructions of Washington.

At the same time, Japanese militarism itself, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, has revived. Japanese monopolistic capital has greatly expanded, and its feathers are fully grown, inevitably seeking to invade and expand outward. The signing of the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" and the formation of the Northeast Asian military alliance are the first steps of Japanese militarism's renewed external expansion. Now, the Japanese reactionaries are again trying to expand their sphere of influence into Southeast Asia and the Pacific region on a large scale. Sato's trip this time is precisely to carry out the wild ambitions of Japanese monopolistic capital.

During this visit, Sato everywhere shouted about the "threat" of China, crazily inciting anti-China sentiment, and actively helping the U.S. to form an anti-China encirclement. In the situation where the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is virtually defunct, U.S. imperialism is instigating the Indonesian reactionaries to form some "cooperative alliance of Southeast Asian countries" and directing the Indian reactionaries to form some "political" anti-China alliance in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. Sato's trip this time is an attempt to rally the reactionaries in Asia and the Pacific, with the U.S. as the backer and Japan as the core, to realize the encirclement of China.

Sato everywhere peddles the U.S. aggressors' "peace talks" trick, shouting about how "North Vietnam needs to make a promise about peace first." He rushed to New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, and other countries directly participating in the Vietnam War to boost the morale of the U.S.'s lackeys. Then he rushed to Saigon to directly hook up with the South Vietnamese puppet regime, further interfering in the Vietnam War.

Sato everywhere acts as the "second-in-command" of U.S. imperialism in Asia, distributing alms to some reactionaries in Asia, granting loans, providing aid, signing agreements, all to allow Japanese monopolistic capital to infiltrate Southeast Asia on a large scale, to participate in controlling and enslaving these countries and regions, to maintain the reactionary rule of the U.S. and its lackeys there, and to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people there.

Just as a wolf that eats people puts on a sheep's skin, Sato, the number one lackey of U.S. imperialism in Asia, actually dresses himself up as an "angel of peace." He boasts that Japan is striving for "peace," maintaining "neutrality" on the Vietnam issue, and that Japan wants to engage in "economic cooperation" with Asian countries, and so on. But a wolf is still a wolf, and Sato's mask must be completely stripped away.

Is the Sato government striving for peace? That's nonsense! Japan has long been the largest military and logistics base for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia, becoming the U.S. imperialism's arms factory in Asia. Japanese arms companies provide the U.S. Vietnam War with a large number of jungle equipment, weapons, ammunition, poison gas, and napalm, and also export large quantities of arms to the U.S.'s lackeys and servants in Thailand, Australia, the Philippines, South Korea, and so on. Recently, the U.S. and Japan have signed an agreement on the production of missiles. The Sato government not only sends military personnel to directly participate in the Vietnam War but also is eager to send the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" abroad to participate in wars of aggression. It has already formulated battle plans aimed at China and some Asian countries. All this fully proves that the Sato government is a bunch of inveterate war-mongering aggressors, the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism in Asia.

Is the Sato government maintaining "neutrality" on the Vietnam issue? That's sheer nonsense! The Sato government has long been directly involved in the Vietnam War. Sato himself rushed to Saigon to support the South Vietnamese puppet regime politically, economically, and militarily. The Japanese reactionaries are a complete accomplice in the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, a mortal enemy of the Vietnamese people.

Does the Sato government want to engage in "economic cooperation" with Asian countries? That's also a complete lie. Everyone knows that Japanese monopolistic capital is using the pretext of "economic cooperation" to invade and expand into Asian countries, attempting to turn them into dual colonies of the U.S. and Japan. The Japanese reactionaries have learned a cunning set of methods from U.S. imperialism. They attempt to use "economic cooperation" as bait to establish a de facto "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" under new historical conditions. The Japanese reactionaries are unadulterated colonialists, greedy bloodsuckers of the Asian people.

Sato's visit this time is strongly supported by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The U.S. wants Japan to play a "leading role" in Asia, which means it wants Japan to be the pillar of U.S. aggression in Asia. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique calls Japan the "stabilizing force" in Asia, which means it wants Japan to act as the executioner of anti-China, anti-communism, and counterrevolution in Asia. The U.S., the Soviet Union, and Japan have formed a counterrevolutionary "holy alliance" in Asia. Sato's frenzied activities in Asia are a part of the counterrevolutionary plan of this "holy alliance."

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in their dealings with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic."

Japanese militarism has already been beaten to a pulp by the Chinese people and the Asian people in the Second World War. But it is not reconciled and now, with the patronage of U.S. imperialism and the support of Soviet revisionism, it is attempting to make a comeback. Hideki Tojo has already returned from the dead, and the Sato government is hastening its steps, retreading the old path of Japanese militarism.

However, it must be warned to the Japanese reactionaries that today's Asia and today's world have entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. An invincibly powerful socialist China stands on the Asian continent, and a great revolutionary storm is sweeping across all of Asia. If the Japanese reactionaries continue down the path of militarism, they will meet a fate even more miserable than Hideki Tojo's and will, together with U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, be thoroughly buried by the Asian people!

    彻底剥掉佐藤的画皮
    本报评论员
    日本反动政府首相佐藤荣作，最近几个月在亚洲和太平洋地区干了紧张的反革命勾当。从十月八日到二十一日，他又到印尼、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾和南越去进行了阴谋活动。佐藤上窜下跳，俨然以美帝国主义在亚洲的“总管”的身份，大肆反华，直接插手美国侵越战争，同亚洲和太平洋地区的反动派密谋镇压亚洲人民的革命运动。
    战后以来，日本首相进行这样广泛范围的出访，还是第一次。这标志着日本反动派走上了从政治、经济、军事各方面更积极地参与美国侵略亚洲战略的阶段，标志着日本军国主义在美帝苏修的支持下进入了更大规模地向亚洲和太平洋地区侵略和扩张的阶段。
    目前，美帝国主义在亚洲的处境越来越不妙。它在越南战场上被打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。它在亚洲的侵略阵地正在发生根本的动摇。在这种情况下，美帝国主义迫切需要它在亚洲最大的走狗日本反动派出来帮它一手。佐藤这一次正是按照华盛顿的指令出外奔走的。
    同时，日本军国主义本身在美帝的扶植下已经死灰复燃，日本垄断资本大大膨胀，羽毛已丰，必然要向外侵略和扩张。“日韩条约”的签订，东北亚军事同盟的形成，是日本军国主义重新向外扩张的第一步。现在，日本反动派又要大规模地向东南亚和太平洋地区扩展它的势力范围。佐藤这一次也正是带着日本垄断资本的狂热的侵略野心而四出奔走的。
    佐藤在这次出访期间，到处叫嚷中国的“威胁”，疯狂煽动反华，积极为美帝拼凑反华包围圈。在东南亚条约组织名存实亡的情况下，美帝国主义正在唆使印尼反动派搞什么“东南亚国家的合作联盟”，指使印度反动派搞什么东南亚和太平洋地区的“政治性”反华联盟。佐藤这一回兜了一圈，是企图把亚洲和太平洋地区的反动派网罗在一起，以美帝为后台，以日本为核心，实现对中国的包围。
    佐藤到处兜售美国侵略者的“和谈”骗局，叫嚷什么“北越需要先作出有关和平的诺言”。他跑到新西兰、澳大利亚、菲律宾等直接参加侵越战争的国家，为美帝的仆从打气。然后又跑到西贡同南越傀儡集团直接挂钩，进一步插手侵越战争。
    佐藤到处以美帝在亚洲的“二老板”自居，向亚洲的一些反动派发放布施，许贷款，给援助，订协定，目的是让日本垄断资本大规模地渗入东南亚，以便参与控制和奴役这些国家和地区，维护美帝及其走狗在那里的反动统治，镇压那里人民的革命斗争。
    正象吃人的豺狼给自己披上羊皮一样，佐藤这个美帝在亚洲的头号走狗竟然把自己打扮成“和平天使”。他大肆吹嘘日本是为“和平”而“努力”的，在越南问题上是保持“中立”的，日本要同亚洲国家进行“经济合作”等等。但是，豺狼毕竟是豺狼，佐藤的画皮必须彻底剥掉。
    佐藤政府是为和平而努力吗？真是活见鬼！日本早已成为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的最大的军事基地和后勤基地，成为美帝国主义在亚洲的兵工厂。日本的军火企业为美国侵越战争提供大量的丛林装备、武器弹药、毒气和凝固汽油弹，并且向美帝的走狗和仆从泰国、澳大利亚、菲律宾、南朝鲜等出口大量军火。最近，美日还签订了关于生产导弹的协定。佐藤政府不仅派了军事人员直接参加侵越战争，而且还跃跃欲试，准备派出日本“自卫队”去国外参加侵略战争。它早已制定了矛头针对中国和一些亚洲国家的作战蓝图。这一切充分证明，佐藤政府是一伙地地道道的侵略成性的战争贩子，是美帝在亚洲的头号打手。
    佐藤政府在越南问题上是保持“中立”的吗？简直是胡说八道！佐藤政府早已直接参与了越南战争。佐藤还亲自跑到西贡去，从政治、经济、军事上支撑南越傀儡集团。日本反动派是美国侵略越南的一个十足的帮凶，是越南人民的死敌。
    佐藤政府要同亚洲国家“经济合作”吗？这也是彻头彻尾的鬼话。谁都知道，日本垄断资本就是在这种“经济合作”的幌子下，对亚洲国家进行侵略和扩张，力图把它们变成美日的双重殖民地。日本反动派从美帝国主义那里学来了新殖民主义一套狡猾的手法。他们企图以“经济合作”为诱饵，在新的历史条件下建立变相的“大东亚共荣圈”。日本反动派是不折不扣的殖民主义者，是亚洲人民的贪婪的吸血鬼。
    佐藤这次出访，是美帝和苏修竭力支持的。美帝要日本在亚洲起“领导作用”，就是要它成为美帝在亚洲的侵略支柱。苏修叛徒集团把日本称作亚洲的“稳定力量”，也就是要日本充当在亚洲反华、反共、反革命的刽子手。美、苏、日已经在亚洲结成了反革命“神圣同盟”。佐藤在亚洲的疯狂活动，正是这个“神圣同盟”的反革命计划的一个组成部分。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    日本军国主义已经在第二次世界大战中，被中国人民和亚洲人民打得头破血流。但它还不死心，现在又在美帝的扶植和苏修的支持下，妄图卷土重来。东条英机已经借尸还魂，佐藤政府正在加快脚步，重走日本军国主义的老路。
    但是，必须正告日本反动派，今日亚洲和今日世界，已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。无比强大的社会主义中国屹立在亚洲大陆上，伟大的革命风暴正在席卷全亚洲。日本反动派沿着军国主义的道路走下去，必将遭到比东条英机更惨的命运，必将同美帝国主义和它的帮凶一起，被亚洲人民所彻底埋葬！
