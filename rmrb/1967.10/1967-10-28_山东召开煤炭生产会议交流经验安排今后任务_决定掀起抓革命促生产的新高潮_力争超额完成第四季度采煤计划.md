Shandong Holds Coal Production Meeting to Share Experiences and Plan Future Tasks
Decides to Launch a New High Tide of Revolution and Production
Strives to Overfulfill the Fourth Quarter Coal Production Plan

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: In the midst of a great revolutionary and productive situation on the coal front in Shandong Province, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Production Command recently convened a full provincial coal production meeting. The meeting decided to further launch a new high tide of revolution and production, striving to complete and overfulfill the fourth quarter coal production plan, and actively prepare for next year's production to achieve greater victories in both revolution and production.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers on the coal front in Shandong Province, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have achieved significant results in production, with local coal mines in the province completing 3.6 percent above the state plan from January to September. In early October, the daily coal production level in the province saw a new increase compared to September.

This full provincial coal production meeting exchanged experiences in revolution and production from the previous period, studied and arranged the production tasks for the fourth quarter of this year and 1968, proposed measures to further launch a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production," and discussed how to prepare in advance for next year's production.

The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that to better complete the production tasks for the fourth quarter of this year and 1968, and to produce more high-quality coal for the country, the most important thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and resolutely respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's latest call to "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism." We must strengthen ideological education for the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary cadres, establish various study classes, and turn the enterprise into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. Each unit should take "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism" as the guideline, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively and practically while addressing problems, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, correctly handle the relationships among revolutionary mass organizations, correctly treat the misled masses, and achieve, consolidate, and develop revolutionary great unity. The meeting also requires each unit's proletarian revolutionary factions to take "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism" as the guideline, carry out a thorough criticism and repudiation of the revolutionary line, thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and their agents in coal enterprises. They should carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the counter-revolutionary economism and revisionist management ideas, and establish the idea of "mining for the revolution" and "working for the revolution." They should thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeois reactionary line of experts managing mines and establish the proletarian revolutionary line of believing in and relying on the masses. They should educate the broad revolutionary masses to take on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production with the attitude of masters of the state and a high sense of responsibility, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, and be models of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary criticism and repudiation. They should be models of insisting on "revolution above ground and production below ground," and models of "revolution on the spot, part-time revolution, and frugal revolution."

The meeting requires each unit to further eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" in the cadre issue through "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism," better educate cadres, release a large number of cadres, and boldly use cadres. Both old and new cadres should go deep into the grassroots and production, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, mobilize the masses, and lead production well.

The People's Liberation Army, which is carrying out "support the left," "support work," or "military control" tasks in various coal mines, has done a lot of work in propagating Mao Zedong Thought, propagating the party's policies, promoting revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and carrying out revolutionary criticism and repudiation, grasping revolution and promoting production, and has achieved great results. The meeting requires each unit to carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement more extensively, deeply, and persistently, learn from the army, and unite with the army to jointly achieve new victories in revolution and production on the coal industry front.

    山东召开煤炭生产会议交流经验安排今后任务
    决定掀起抓革命促生产的新高潮
    力争超额完成第四季度采煤计划
    据新华社济南电　在山东省煤炭战线革命和生产的一派大好形势下，山东省革命委员会生产指挥部最近召开了全省煤炭生产会议，决定进一步掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮，力争完成和超额完成第四季度煤炭生产计划，并积极为明年生产作好准备，夺取革命、生产的更大胜利。
    山东省煤炭战线上的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在人民解放军的大力支援下，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，生产上取得了很大成绩，全省地方煤矿一至九月份超额百分之三点六完成了国家计划。十月上旬，全省煤炭的日产水平又比九月份有了新的提高。
    这次全省煤炭生产会议，交流了前一时期各矿抓革命、促生产的经验，研究安排了今年第四季度和一九六八年的生产任务，提出了进一步掀起“抓革命，促生产”新高潮的措施，并且研究了如何提前为明年的生产做好准备工作的问题。
    出席会议的代表一致认为，要更好地完成今年第四季度和一九六八年的生产任务，为国家多产优质煤，最重要的一条就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“斗私，批修”的最新号召，加强对无产阶级革命派和革命干部的思想教育，办好各种学习班，把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。各单位要以“斗私，批修”为纲，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，加强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，正确处理革命群众组织之间的关系，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合。会议还要求各单位的无产阶级革命派，要以“斗私，批修”为纲，搞好革命的大批判，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其代理人在煤矿企业中散布的一切反革命修正主义流毒。搞好本单位的斗、批、改，大破反革命经济主义和修正主义的办企业思想，大立“为革命而采煤”，“为革命而工作”的思想；大破专家办矿的资产阶级反动路线，大立相信群众、依靠群众的无产阶级革命路线。要教育广大革命群众，以国家主人翁态度和高度的责任心，挑起革命、生产两副重担，加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，做革命大联合和革命大批判的模范，做坚持“上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产”的模范，做“就地闹革命、业余闹革命、节约闹革命”的模范。
    会议要求各单位通过“斗私，批修”，进一步肃清在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的流毒，更好地教育干部，大批解放干部，大胆使用干部。新老干部都要深入基层、深入生产，用毛泽东思想为武器，发动群众，领导好生产。
    在各煤矿执行“支左”、“支工”或“军管”任务的人民解放军，进入煤矿后，在宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策，促进革命的大联合、革命三结合和搞好革命大批判，抓革命促生产等方面，做了大量的工作，取得了很大的成绩。会议要求各单位更广泛、更深入、更持久地开展“拥军爱民”运动，向解放军学习，和解放军团结在一起，共同夺取煤炭工业战线上革命和生产的新的胜利。
