Vietnamese Comrades Visit the Red Guards' Revolutionary Rebellion Exhibition

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 3rd, the deputy leader of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Party and Government Delegation, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic, Comrade Nguyen Huu Hanh, and other delegation members, were accompanied by Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, Comrade Li Xiannian, to visit the "Capital Red Guards' Revolutionary Rebellion Exhibition."

After visiting, Comrade Nguyen Huu Hanh wrote an inscription for the exhibition. The inscription reads: "We are very pleased to have the opportunity to visit the 'Capital Red Guards' Revolutionary Rebellion Exhibition.' Through the exhibition, we have a clearer understanding of the great significance of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and the important role of the Red Guards in this revolution.

"The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution aims to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent the restoration of capitalism in China, and ensure that socialist China will never change color. This is a revolution of great significance not only to China but also to the world.

"We firmly believe that under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has already achieved decisive results and will surely achieve complete victory."

This morning, when the Vietnamese comrades arrived at the exhibition hall, hundreds of Red Guards gathered at the entrance, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and President Ho Chi Minh, waving red copies of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and the national flags of China and Vietnam, warmly welcoming their comrades from the front lines of the struggle against American imperialism.

As the Vietnamese comrades left the exhibition hall, the Red Guards repeatedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live President Ho!" "Seven hundred million Chinese people are determined to be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people!" "Victory to Vietnam!" "Defeat to American imperialism!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 2nd, the delegation led by Comrade Nguyen Van Danh from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam visited the "Capital Red Guards' Revolutionary Rebellion Exhibition."

During the visit, the Vietnamese comrades and the Red Guards had a cordial conversation. Nguyen Van Danh enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors. In the cordial conversation, the Chinese and Vietnamese comrades repeatedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"

The delegation also visited the clay sculpture exhibition "The Rent Collection Courtyard."
