	At the farewell banquet for the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Revolutionary Movement and Government Delegation visiting China

	Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

	New China News Agency, October 5th — Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the farewell banquet hosted by Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye:

	Your Excellency Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye, distinguished Congolese (Brazzaville) guests, friends, comrades,

	Today, we are honored to participate in this grand banquet hosted by Your Excellency Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye and the delegation he leads. It is a great pleasure to once again gather with our Congolese (Brazzaville) friends. Please allow me to express, on behalf of the Chinese comrades present, our heartfelt thanks to Your Excellency Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye.

	During their stay in Beijing, the delegation led by Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye of the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Revolutionary Movement and Government held friendly talks with our national leaders and met with our great leader Chairman Mao. The distinguished guests participated in the celebrations of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, visited factories, military units, people's communes, schools, and had extensive interactions with Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and Red Guards. Through these interactions, our friends can feel the deep friendship that the Chinese people have for the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends from the frontlines of the anti-imperialist struggle in Africa. They welcome you with great enthusiasm and sincerity.

	Why do the Chinese people have such deep friendship for the Congolese (Brazzaville) and African friends? This is not only because the Chinese people and the African people have shared the common experience of suffering from imperialist aggression and oppression in the past, and today face the common task of anti-imperialist struggle; it is also because the Chinese people, armed with the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, fully understand that if the oppressed peoples and nations of the world do not achieve liberation, then the Chinese people will not achieve thorough liberation. Our guests can see this aspiration of the Chinese people in all the places they have visited. The Congolese (Brazzaville) friends regard China as a completely reliable comrade-in-arms, which is a great trust and support for us. The Chinese people will not disappoint this expectation. Our friendship is sincere, not false. This friendship can withstand tests. In the common struggle against imperialism, the friendship between the Chinese people and the Congolese (Brazzaville) and African peoples will surely be increasingly consolidated and developed.

	Your Excellency Prime Minister and Congolese (Brazzaville) friends, during your visits and tours, you can also see the vibrant revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people. This is because the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has indeed mobilized the broad masses of the people, and people's spiritual outlook has undergone fundamental changes. Social productivity has been further liberated. Your Excellency Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye and the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends have enthusiastically praised our Cultural Revolution, refuted the slanders and attacks of imperialism and its lackeys, and expressed their belief that this Cultural Revolution will make China a socialist country with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science, modern culture, and modern national defense. This is a great trust, encouragement, and support for the Chinese people. For this, we express our heartfelt thanks.

	Friends, comrades! In 1964, President Massamba-Debat of the Congo (Brazzaville) visited our country, opening a new chapter in the friendly relations between our two countries. The friendly cooperative relations between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields have developed very rapidly. We are pleased to see that Your Excellency Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye's visit this time has further advanced the friendly relations between our two countries. This not only serves the interests of the peoples of our two countries but also helps to strengthen the unity of the Asian and African peoples in their anti-imperialist struggle.

	When Congolese (Brazzaville) friends talk about aid, they always express their gratitude to the Chinese side, which makes us feel a bit embarrassed. Chairman Mao has always taught us: "China should make greater contributions to humanity. In the past long period, however, such contributions have been too few. This makes us feel ashamed." He also said: "The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of the people who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The Chinese people will forever follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao. At the same time, aid is mutual. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Congo (Brazzaville), the Congolese (Brazzaville) government and people have consistently advocated expelling the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the United Nations and restoring the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China; supporting the just struggle of the Chinese people and government to liberate their own territory of Taiwan, and resolutely opposing the imperialist plot to create "two Chinas." The victories achieved by the Congolese (Brazzaville) people and African peoples in their anti-imperialist struggle are also powerful support for the Chinese people. All this we will never forget.

	Your Excellency Prime Minister and Congolese (Brazzaville) friends will be visiting our southern regions tomorrow and then returning to your country. Before your departure, please take with you the most friendly greetings from the 700 million Chinese people to the Congolese (Brazzaville) people and the African people. Allow me to quote a sentence from Your Excellency Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye to conclude my speech: "May the friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville) flow like the Yangtze River and the Congo River, forever."

	Now, please raise your glasses:

	To the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville),
	To the great unity of the Asian and African peoples in their anti-imperialist struggle,
	To the health and longevity of President Massamba-Debat,
	To the health and longevity of our great leader Chairman Mao,
	To the health of Your Excellency Prime Minister Ambrouise Noumazalaye and all the distinguished Congolese (Brazzaville) guests,
	To the health of the diplomats and their spouses present,
	To the health of all the friends and comrades present,

	Cheers!

    在刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团访问中国举行的告别宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社五日讯　周恩来总理在努马扎莱总理告别宴会上的讲话尊敬的安布鲁瓦斯·努马扎莱总理阁下，尊敬的刚果（布）贵宾们，朋友们，同志们，
     今天，我们能够参加努马扎莱总理阁下和由他率领的代表团举行的这个盛大宴会，同刚果（布）的朋友们再一次欢聚一堂，感到非常高兴。请允许我代表出席宴会的中国同志们，向努马扎莱总理阁下表示衷心的感谢。
    努马扎莱总理阁下率领的刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团，在北京期间，同我国国家领导人进行了友好会谈，并且会见了我们的伟大领袖毛主席。贵宾们参加了中华人民共和国成立十八周年的庆祝活动，参观了工厂、军队、人民公社、学校，同中国的工农兵、学生和红卫兵们，进行了广泛的接触。从这些接触中，朋友们可以体会到：中国人民对来自非洲反帝斗争前线的刚果（布）朋友们是怀着多么深厚的友情的，他们非常热烈、真诚地欢迎你们。
    为什么中国人民对刚果（布）和非洲的朋友们有这样深厚的友谊呢？这不仅是因为中国人民同非洲人民在过去有受殖民主义侵略压迫的共同遭遇，今天又面临着反帝斗争的共同任务；而且是因为用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，完全懂得：如果全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族得不到解放，那么，中国人民也就不能得到彻底的解放。贵宾们在所到过的地方，都可以了解到中国人民的这种心愿。刚果（布）朋友把中国看作完全可以信赖的战友，这是对我们很大的信任和支持。中国人民决不辜负这种期望。我们之间的友谊是真诚的，而不是虚假的。这种友谊是经得起考验的。在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，中国人民同刚果（布）和非洲人民的友谊，必将日益巩固和发展。
    总理阁下和刚果（布）朋友们，你们在参观访问过程中，还可以看到中国人民那种生气勃勃的革命气象。这是由于毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，的确把广大人民群众充分发动起来了，人们的精神面貌有了根本的变化。社会生产力得到了进一步解放。努马扎莱总理阁下和刚果（布）朋友们热情地赞扬了我国文化大革命，驳斥了帝国主义及其走狗的诽谤和攻击，并且表示相信，这场文化大革命将使中国成为一个具有现代农业、现代工业、现代科学、现代文化和现代国防的社会主义国家，这是对中国人民很大的信任、鼓舞和支持。对此，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    朋友们，同志们！一九六四年刚果（布）总统马桑巴—代巴阁下来我国访问，为我们两国友好关系开辟了新的局面。我们两国在政治、经济、文化各个方面的友好合作关系，都有了很迅速的发展。我们高兴地看到，努马扎莱总理阁下这次的访问，又把我们两国之间的友好关系向前推进了一步。这不仅符合我们两国人民的利益，而且有助于加强亚非人民的团结反帝事业。
    刚果（布）朋友们在谈到援助问题时，总是向中国方面表示感谢，这使我们有些过意不去。毛主席一直教导我们：“中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。而这种贡献，在过去一个长时期内，则是太少了。这使我们感到惭愧。”又说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”中国人民将永远遵循毛主席的伟大教导办事。同时，援助是相互的。自从中国刚果（布）两国建交以来，刚果（布）政府和人民一贯主张在联合国内驱逐蒋介石匪帮，恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利；支持中国人民和中国政府为解放自己领土台湾而进行的正义斗争，坚决反对帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。刚果（布）人民和非洲人民在反帝斗争中，不断取得的胜利，更是对中国人民的有力支持。这一切都是我们永远不会忘记的。
    总理阁下和刚果（布）朋友们明天就要到我国南方去访问，并从那里回国。在临别之前，请你们把七亿中国人民最友好的祝愿，带给刚果（布）人民和非洲人民。请允许我引用努马扎莱总理阁下的一句话来结束我的讲话：“祝中刚两国人民之间的友谊象奔流不息的长江和刚果河一样万古长流。”
    现在请大家举杯：
    为中刚（布）两国人民的战斗友谊，
    为亚非人民的反帝大团结，
    为马桑巴—代巴总统阁下的健康长寿，
    为我们的伟大领袖毛主席的健康长寿，
    为努马扎莱总理阁下和全体刚果（布）贵宾们的健康，
    为在座的各国使节和夫人们的健康，
    为在座的朋友们和同志们的健康，
    干杯！
