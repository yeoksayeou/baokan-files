The study classes use Chairman Mao's works and his latest directives as the core curriculum, combining political training with military training. The classes are organized according to the "three-in-one" principle, where everyone is both a teacher and a student. The classes adopt a method of combining internal and external efforts, promoting mutual progress, and closely linking learning with the current struggles within the unit. The classes adhere to the principles of self-reliance and frugality, with everyone being both a student and a service provider. The atmosphere in the classes is one of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness.

The "August 18" Joint Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Party, Government, and Mass Organizations

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." All "August 18" warriors and revolutionary cadres in the Qinghai Provincial Party, Government, and Mass Organizations have responded immediately. On the day after the National Day holiday, October 4, at a meeting of the heads of revolutionary organizations convened by the Joint Committee, everyone unanimously raised the issue of how to implement Chairman Mao's great directive to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" and to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Everyone had only one thought: to do as Chairman Mao says, to resolutely establish the study classes, no matter how great the difficulties. The next day, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes began. How should the study classes be conducted? Who should be selected for the first session? We solved these problems by mobilizing the masses. Everyone analyzed the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the provincial Party, Government, and Mass Organizations, believing that to develop and consolidate revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one" combination, to further promote the great criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, the key lies in the cadre issue. And the solution to the cadre issue lies in overcoming the "self" in the minds of revolutionary cadres and masses. Considering that the PLA support cadres have experience in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and in breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, we decided that each group should include representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and PLA support cadres, forming "three-in-one" study groups. Each group is led by a PLA comrade as the political instructor, and the daily routines of the study class are managed by the PLA comrades according to military standards. Forming study groups according to the "three-in-one" principle ensures that we can learn directly from the PLA, and it is also beneficial for the revolutionary masses, revolutionary leading cadres, and PLA support cadres to understand, help, and educate each other, enhancing unity and strengthening the fighting friendship between the revolutionary masses and revolutionary leading cadres, as well as between the military and the people, laying the foundation for developing and consolidating the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

When deciding what content to use for educating cadres, we firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, placing a firm and correct political direction in the first place, and using Chairman Mao's works and his latest directives as the core curriculum. Who will teach? Everyone said, Chairman Mao has long taught us that we must educate ourselves and liberate ourselves. Everyone is both a teacher and a student, teaching and learning from each other, helping each other, and improving together. Based on this principle, we took "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the main line, bringing current class struggle practical issues, closely linking them with the actual situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, and linking them with our own active thoughts. We first sat down, studied the documents, delved into them, and thought about problems. We used the "Old Five Articles" ("On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Opposing Liberalism," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains") as the main weapons for fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, with group discussions as the main form, and also engaged in mutual heart-to-heart talks, exchanging Chairman Mao's quotations, studying and applying them repeatedly. In the process of learning, we promoted the spirit of self-criticism, examined and checked our thoughts, summarized experiences and lessons, insisted on the policy of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," proposed problems ourselves, solved problems ourselves, exposed our "self," and criticized it ourselves. This approach has been widely reflected as effective and fruitful. A representative from a revolutionary mass organization in a unit, before entering the study class, always thought that he had been revolutionary for a long time and had no "self" in his mind. After studying, using Mao Zedong Thought to compare, this comrade excitedly said: "I not only have 'self,' but it is very serious. For example, on the cadre issue, I did not want them to come out, if they did not come out, they had to listen to me, if they came out and combined, I had to listen to you, could it be that after more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, I still had to be led by you? Due to the 'I am the most revolutionary' mentality, I did not allow cadres who had made mistakes to come out." There were also revolutionary mass organizations that, due to mutual dissatisfaction, all wanted to be the core of the union, and as soon as they met, they exposed each other's shortcomings and argued endlessly. This time, after the study, they all made self-criticisms at the self-criticism meeting, and their relationships improved significantly.

From the beginning of the study class, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions that students should "focus on learning, also learn other subjects, that is, not only learn literature, but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie." We combined political training with military training, spending one and a half hours each day on military training. We aimed to strengthen the organization, discipline, and collective consciousness of the proletariat through military training. The PLA support comrades, with full enthusiasm and a high sense of responsibility, used their actions and words to impart the spirit of the PLA's "three-eight" style and high organization and discipline to local cadres. The study class presented a strong atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. Everyone expressed their determination to bring the results of learning from the PLA back to the office, making the office also establish a revolutionary style.

When the study class began, we found that some comrades were concerned that if the main representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in various units were concentrated in the study class, the leadership of the movement in their units would be affected; those left in the units also hoped to timely understand the situation of the Mao Zedong Thought study class. On the second day of the opening, we convened a meeting of the main representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in various units, letting everyone discuss how to handle this issue. Everyone unanimously agreed that the method of detachment from current struggle reality, detachment from the masses, and closed-door learning is contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, link theory with practice, and closely link the learning in the study class with the current struggle reality in the unit. We adopted the method of combining internal and external efforts and promoting mutual progress. The representatives of revolutionary mass organizations participating in the study class used their rest time or Sundays to regularly return to their units to introduce the situation of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, sharing their learning gains and education received. Some units even established liaison personnel to communicate information and established contact systems. In this way, the good experiences and styles of the Mao Zedong Thought study class quickly spread throughout the units of the provincial Party, Government, and Mass Organizations. Units with a larger number of people have successively established Mao Zedong Thought study classes within their units. These study classes also universally adopted the "three-in-one" grouping principle and implemented the combination of political and military training, triggering a new high tide of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism in the provincial Party, Government, and Mass Organizations. Since the comrades participating in the study class can timely understand the situation and problems in their units and can bring these situations and problems to the study class in a timely manner, this again promoted everyone to better combine learning with reality.

Before the study class began, we repeatedly studied and understood Chairman Mao's instruction to "be thrifty and make revolution," adhering to the principle of self-reliance and frugal learning, and proposed the slogan of turning the study class into an anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style cadre training ground. All comrades participating in the study class brought their own copies of Chairman Mao's works and related learning materials, and their own luggage. From the beginning of the class to now, we have not asked the state for a single penny. More than 110 students have no service personnel, and no one is detached from learning for work. The responsible comrades of the Joint Committee are both ordinary students and leaders of the study class. When there is work, everyone pitches in, divides tasks, and completes them together, such as cleaning, public welfare labor, organizing learning bulletins, receiving and sending materials, and receiving visitors, all of which are done by everyone. Everyone is both a student and a service provider.

This session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class was established under the inspiration of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's great battle call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" has illuminated our hearts. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has tempered us, educated us, and raised our understanding of the class struggle, the struggle between the two roads, and the struggle between the two lines in the socialist period. We are determined to turn the study class into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought and have initially achieved some results. However, our establishment of the study class is just the beginning, and our understanding of Chairman Mao's great directive to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" is still very shallow. In the future, we will definitely work harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, humbly learn from the advanced experiences of other units and provinces and cities across the country, and continue to advance to turn our study class and our offices into bright red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

    办毛泽东思想学习班的初步体会
    学习班把毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示作为基本课程，把政治训练和军事训练结合起来。学习班按照“三结合”的原则编组，大家都是教员，又都是学生。学习班采取内外结合、互相促进的办法，把学习紧密地同本单位当前的斗争实际联系起来。学习班坚持自力更生和勤俭办学的方针，人人都是学员，又都是服务员。学习班里呈现出团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的气氛。
    青海省级党政群系统“八·一八”联委会
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近发出了要斗私，批修的伟大号召。我们青海省级党政群系统全体“八·一八”战士和革命干部，闻风而动，立即执行。国庆节假日后的头一天——十月四日，在联委会召开的所属革命组织负责人会议上，大家不约而同地提出了如何贯彻执行毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大指示，举办毛泽东思想学习班的问题。大家只有一个心眼，就是毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，坚决开办学习班，那怕有天大的困难，也挡不住我们的决心。第二天，毛泽东思想学习班便开始办起来了。毛泽东思想学习班怎样办，第一期应该选送哪些人去学习呢？有问题就发动群众来解决。大家分析了当前省级党政群系统无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，认为要发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，进一步推动革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，关键是干部问题。而干部问题的解决，关键又是要克服革命派和干部头脑里的“私”字。大家考虑到解放军支左同志有斗私批修，破私立公的经验，于是我们确定，每组都有革命群众组织负责人、革命领导干部和解放军支左干部参加，组成“三结合”的学习小组。每组都由解放军同志担任政治指导员，学习班的起居作息，也都是由解放军同志按照军事化的要求来管理。根据“三结合”的原则编成学习小组，保证了我们可以面对面地向解放军学习，也有利于无产阶级革命派、革命领导干部和解放军支左同志之间互相了解，互相帮助，互相教育，增进团结，加强革命派和革命领导干部之间以及军民之间的战斗友谊，为发展和巩固革命的“三结合”打下基础。
    我们在解决学习班以什么内容教育干部这个问题时，坚决按照毛主席的教导，把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，把毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示作为基本课程。谁来教呢？大家说，毛主席不是早就教导过吗，自己教育自己，自己解放自己。大家都是教员，又都是学生，互教互学，互相帮助，共同提高。根据这个原则，我们便以“斗私，批修”为纲，带着当前阶级斗争实践中的问题，紧密联系一年来无产阶级文化大革命的实际，联系自己的活思想，首先坐下来，学文件，钻进去，想问题。我们把“老五篇”（《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》）作为斗私批修的主要法宝，以小组讨论为主要形式，同时也相互谈心，互送毛主席语录，反复学，反复用。在学习中，发扬自我批评的精神，对照检查思想，总结经验教训，坚持“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方针，自己提出问题，自己解决问题，自己亮出“私”字，自己去“批”。这样做，普遍反映提高很快，收效很好。有个单位革命群众组织的负责同志，进学习班之前，一直认为自己造反早，思想上没有“私”字。经过学习，用毛泽东思想一对照，这位同志激动地说：“我不仅有‘私’字，而且很严重。如在干部问题上，我就不愿意让他们站出来，站不出来你得听我的，站出来结合了，我就得听你的，难道文化大革命搞了一年多，我还得受你的领导吗？由于‘唯我最革命’的思想作怪，就不让犯了错误的干部站出来。”还有的革命群众组织之间，由于互不服气，都要争作联合的核心，一见面就相互揭短，争吵不休。这次经过学习之后，在斗私会上各自都作了自我批评，关系有了很大改善。
    学习班一开始，我们就根据毛主席关于学生要“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的教导，把政治训练和军事训练结合起来，每天以一个半小时的时间进行军训。我们把加强无产阶级的组织性、纪律性和整体观念，作为通过军事训练所要达到的主要目的。解放军支左的同志以满腔热情和高度负责的革命精神，用身教和言教，把解放军的三八作风和高度的组织性、纪律性，传授给了地方干部。学习班里，呈现出浓厚的团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的气氛。大家表示，一定要把在学习班向解放军学习的成果带回机关去，使机关也树立革命化的作风。
    学习班开学时，我们发现有的同志担心各单位革命群众组织主要负责人都集中到学习班，本单位运动的领导会受到影响；留在单位的同志，也很希望及时了解毛泽东思想学习班的情况。开学的第二天，我们便召开各单位革命群众组织主要负责人会议，让大家讨论如何处理这个问题。大家一致认为，那种脱离当前斗争实际、脱离群众、闭门办学的方法，是违背毛主席的教导的。我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，理论联系实际，把学习班的学习紧密地同本单位当前的斗争实际联系起来。我们采取了内外结合，互相促进的做法。参加学习班的革命群众组织负责人，利用休息时间或星期日，定期地回本单位介绍毛泽东思想学习班的情况，谈自己的学习收获和受到的教育。有的单位还设立了互通情况的联络员，规定了联系制度。这样，就使毛泽东思想学习班的好经验、好作风迅速在省级党政群系统各单位传播开了。人数较多的单位，都先后由革命群众组织开办了本单位的毛泽东思想学习班。这些学习班也普遍采用了“三结合”的编组原则，也实行政治训练和军事训练相结合，省级党政群系统掀起了斗私批修新高潮。由于参加学习班的同志能够随时了解到本单位的情况和问题，又能把这些情况和问题及时带到学习班来，这就又促进了大家能够更好地紧密结合实际进行学习。
    学习班开学之前，我们反复学习、领会了毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，坚持自力更生和勤俭办学的方针，提出了把学习班办成抗大式的教育干部阵地的口号。参加学习班的全体同志，都是自己带毛主席著作和有关学习材料，自己带行李。我们从开学到现在，没有向国家要一文钱。一百一十多个学员，没有一个服务人员，也没有一个脱离学习的工作人员。联委会的负责人既是普通学员，又是学习班的领导成员。有事大家一起动手，分工完成，诸如清洁卫生、公益劳动、整理学习简报、收发材料、接待来人等，都由大家来做，人人都是学员，人人又都是服务员。
    我们这期毛泽东思想学习班，是在伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下办起来的。毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号召照亮了我们的心。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，锻炼了我们，教育了我们，提高了我们对社会主义时期两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的认识。我们下定决心，要把学习班办成毛泽东思想大学校，并初步取得了一些成绩。但是，我们举办学习班还仅仅是开始，对毛主席的“斗私，批修”的伟大指示理解得还很肤浅。今后，我们一定更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，虚心学习其他单位和全国各兄弟省、市的先进经验，为把我们的学习班和我们的机关办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校而继续前进。　（新华社西宁二十四日电）
