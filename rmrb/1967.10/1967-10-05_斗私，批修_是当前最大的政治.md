At a time when the whole nation is joyfully celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, Comrade Lin Biao, in his extremely important speech, has conveyed to us Chairman Mao's recent call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." This is a grand strategy to ensure that our country will never change color for thousands of years to come. It is the top priority of our current struggle, the greatest political task for us revolutionaries.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls, a revolution to criticize and transform selfishness into selflessness, a revolution to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." Unless we eliminate the "self" in our minds, we cannot truly establish the spirit of selflessness among the proletariat. The poison of the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road in politics, ideology, and theory cannot be thoroughly purged. We cannot carry the struggle against revisionism to the end. Through more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply felt that "we must regard ourselves as a force for revolution and at the same time regard ourselves as an object of revolution." Only by waging a resolute struggle against the "self" in our minds can we resolutely struggle against the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road. As the revolution deepens and our social status as proletarian revolutionaries changes, the task of "fighting selfishness" has become a serious one before us. Without "fighting selfishness," the proletarian worldview of selflessness cannot be established; without "fighting selfishness," we cannot fully understand and correctly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; without "fighting selfishness," we cannot thoroughly criticize and expose Chinese Khrushchev and his agents; without "fighting selfishness," the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot be carried to the end. Only by waging a thorough struggle against the "self" in our minds can we carry the struggle against revisionism to the end.

In the past, due to the influence of "self," there were relatively serious petty-bourgeois factionalisms among several revolutionary mass organizations, and we could not unite well to fight. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the working class, our factory's proletarian revolutionaries have once again studied the "Old Three Articles" and waged a struggle against the "self" in our minds, eliminated factionalism, and finally united.

Through revolutionary great unity, we have deeply felt that only by constantly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can we eliminate "self" and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments to win new victories.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory." We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, use Mao Zedong Thought to defeat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, carry out ideological revolutionization, further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," constantly enhance our proletarian revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, strive to temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, let Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in our minds, and make our ranks a highly proletarianized, highly revolutionary, and highly combat-ready force. We will criticize and expose the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road and carry the struggle against revisionism to the end. At the same time, we will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," firmly grasp revolution, vigorously promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

    “斗私，批修”是当前最大的政治
    成都邮电器材厂无产阶级革命派
    在举国欢腾热烈庆祝建国十八周年的时候，林彪同志在极为重要的讲话中，给我们传达了毛主席最近提出的“斗私，批修”的伟大号召。它是保证我们国家千秋万代永不变色的大计。它是我们无产阶级革命派当前压倒一切的战斗任务，是最大的政治。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的、破私立公的大革命，也就是“斗私，批修”的大革命。我们头脑里的“私”字不破除，无产阶级的“公”字就不能很好地树立，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在政治上、思想上、理论上的流毒就不能彻底肃清，就不能把反修斗争进行到底。经过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，我们深深地体会到，“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”只有同自己头脑中的“私”字作坚决的斗争，才能坚决同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争。随着革命的深入发展，随着我们无产阶级革命派社会地位的改变，“斗私”，已成为一个严重的任务摆在我们的面前。不“斗私”，无产阶级一心为公的世界观就不可能树立；不“斗私”，我们就不能很好地理解和正确地执行毛主席的革命路线；不“斗私”，就不能很好地把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批深批透，斗垮斗臭；不“斗私”，无产阶级文化大革命就不可能进行到底。只有同自己头脑中的“私”字斗争到底，才能把反修斗争进行到底。
    过去，我们几个革命群众组织中，由于“私”字作怪，有着比较严重的小资产阶级派性，不能很好地联合起来战斗。在毛主席对工人阶级的最新指示指引下，我厂无产阶级革命派又一次学习了“老三篇”，同自己头脑里的“私”字进行了斗争，铲除了山头，终于联合起来了。
    通过革命的大联合，我们最深刻地体会到，只有不断地活学活用毛主席著作，才能斗掉“私”字，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断地夺取新的胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”我们一定最最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，以“斗私，批修”为纲，用毛泽东思想去战胜资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，搞好思想革命化，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，不断地增强我们的无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，努力把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，让毛泽东思想牢牢地在我们头脑里扎根，使我们的队伍成为一支非常无产阶级化、非常革命化、非常战斗化的队伍，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，把反修斗争进行到底。同时，我们要坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命、生产的双胜利。
