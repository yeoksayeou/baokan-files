Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently delivered an important speech at the opening ceremony of the Second Conference of Heroic Warriors of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam. He emphasized that the tremendous victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam over the past two years have been of great strategic significance in the important stage of consecutively defeating the "limited war" of the American aggressors.

He said that through the practice of combat, we have come to recognize even more clearly the immense power of the people's war. On this basis, we have summarized valuable experiences, improved the strategic and tactical aspects of the people's war, and have a deeper understanding of the laws governing the development of the national liberation revolution in the South. This has enabled our entire army and people to have even greater confidence in our immense capabilities and an even firmer resolve to defeat the American aggressors.

Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out that this conference is being held at a time when the military and people of South Vietnam have consecutively achieved extremely great victories. This conference is a conference of the entire military and people of South Vietnam resolutely defeating the American aggressors. It marks the growth of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam and is an important milestone in the development and strengthening of the revolutionary movement in the South. This conference will surely inspire the military and people of South Vietnam to overcome any hardships and sacrifices to achieve complete victory.

Nguyen Huu Tho said that this conference marks the high development of revolutionary heroism and also marks the growth of the military and people of the South in a historical stage of the resistance war—the stage of defeating the "limited war" of the American aggressors. It marks the beginning of a new stage of even greater glory and even greater victories in defeating the American aggressors and ultimately achieving complete victory.

On behalf of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho once again commended all the cadres and soldiers of various units of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam who have recently consecutively achieved brilliant victories over the enemy and made contributions to thwarting the vicious plots and brutal schemes of American imperialism and its lackeys. He said that here, comrades will together joyfully sing the praises and commend the great achievements of our military and people and the great achievements of each warrior attending the conference. At the same time, we will also summarize beneficial experiences in the days of fierce battles and in the victories and achievements we have won, so as to push our revolutionary struggle to a new stage.

He said that in addition to commending achievements, the most important thing is to play the role of revolutionary heroism education in the army and among the broad masses, mobilizing the entire military and people to strive forward and excellently complete all the tasks assigned by the people.

Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out that although the American aggressors have suffered heavy defeats, they still stubbornly refuse to give up their ambition to invade South Vietnam and permanently divide Vietnam. They are desperately making new efforts in both military and political aspects, attempting to reverse the situation and stop the increasingly vigorous revolutionary upsurge in South Vietnam. While strengthening the war of aggression against South Vietnam and the war of sabotage against North Vietnam, American imperialism will also continue to shout for "peace talks," attempting to deceive world public opinion and force us to negotiate under conditions favorable to them. In the coming period, American imperialism may create new difficulties for us. However, no matter how it strengthens and expands the war or plays what tricks, it cannot escape the fate of failure.

Nguyen Huu Tho said that from the practice on the battlefield of South Vietnam, we see that our military and people have never had so many favorable conditions for achieving great victories as they do now. Our initiative has never been so solid. Our offensives in all aspects have never been so developed. The possibility of our military and people defeating the American aggressors and their lackey armies is becoming a clear reality. Therefore, even if American imperialism increases its troops by fifty, sixty, or even more, it will only suffer even more severe and more shameful defeats.

Nguyen Huu Tho stressed that we have a firm stance, an unshakable spirit of decisive battle and victory, an ironclad belief in the final victory, a momentum of bravely advancing to seize victory, and an indomitable spirit. We will surely thwart all the aggressive plots of American imperialism and its lackey clique, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unify the country.

　　阮友寿主席在越南南方第二届英模勇士大会上发表重要讲话
　　发挥人民战争威力埋葬美国侵略强盗
　　不管美帝扩大战争还是玩弄狡诈伎俩都摆脱不了失败的命运
    新华社河内十七日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，不久以前在越南南方人民解放武装力量第二届英模勇士大会上致开幕词时强调指出，越南南方军民两年多来的巨大胜利，对接连挫败美国强盗的“局部战争”的非常重要的阶段，具有非常巨大的战略意义。
    他说，经过战斗的实践，我们更加认清了人民战争的无比巨大的威力。在这个基础上，我们总结了宝贵的经验，提高人民战争的战略战术，更加认清了南方民族解放革命的发展规律，使得我们全军全民更加相信自己的巨大能力，更加决心战胜美国侵略强盗。
    阮友寿指出，这次大会是在越南南方军民接连取得极其巨大的胜利的时候召开的。这次大会是越南南方全体军民坚决战胜美国侵略强盗的大会，它标志着越南南方人民解放武装力量的成长，并且是南方革命运动发展壮大的重要的里程碑。这次大会必将鼓舞越南南方军民不怕任何艰苦牺牲去夺取彻底胜利。
    阮友寿说，这次大会标志着革命英雄主义的高度发展，也标志着南方军民在抗战的一个历史阶段——战胜美国强盗的“局部战争”的阶段中的成长，标志着开始了一个更辉煌、更巨大的战胜美国侵略者，进而夺取彻底胜利的新阶段。
    阮友寿代表越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会，再一次表彰最近接连辉煌地战胜了敌人，为挫败美帝国主义及其走狗的恶毒阴谋和残暴计划作出贡献的南方人民解放武装力量各单位的全体干部和战士。他说，在这里，同志们将一起欢欣鼓舞地歌颂和表彰我们军民的伟大成绩和参加大会的每一个战士的伟大成绩，同时我们也将在激烈战斗的日子里，在取得的胜利和成绩中总结出有益的经验，以便把我们的革命斗争推向新的阶段。
    他说，除了表彰成绩之外，最重要的一点是必须在军队和广大群众中发挥大会的革命英雄主义的教育作用，动员全体军民努力冲上前去，出色地完成人民交给的一切任务。
    阮友寿指出，美国强盗虽然遭到了惨重失败，但是它仍然顽固地不肯放弃侵略越南南方、长期分割越南的野心。它正在军事和政治两个方面拚命作出新的努力，妄图扭转局势，制止日益蓬勃发展的越南南方革命高潮。美帝国主义在加强对越南南方的侵略战争和对越南北方的破坏性战争的同时，还将会继续叫嚷“和平谈判”，妄图欺骗世界舆论和迫使我们在对它有利的条件下进行谈判。在即将到来的期间里，美帝国主义可能会给我们造成新的困难，但是，不管它怎样加强和扩大战争，玩弄什么狡诈的伎俩，也摆脱不了失败的命运。
    阮友寿说，我们从越南南方战场上的实践中看到，我们军民从来没有象现在这样具有如此多的夺取巨大胜利的有利条件。我们掌握的主动权从来没有象现在这样稳固。我们在各方面的攻势从来没有象现在这样得到开展。我们军民打败美国侵略军及其走狗军队的可能性正在变成明显的现实。因此，美帝国主义再增加五十万、六十万或者更多的军队，也只能遭到更加惨重和更加可耻的失败。
    阮友寿强调说，我们具有坚定的立场，具有不可动摇的决战决胜的精神，具有对最后胜利的钢铁般的信念，具有勇猛前进去夺取胜利的气势和无比顽强的精神。我们必将挫败美帝国主义及其走狗集团的一切侵略阴谋，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
