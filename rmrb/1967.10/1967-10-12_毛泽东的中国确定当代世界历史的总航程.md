Comrade Shehu's Speech at the Shanghai Revolutionary People's and the Three Armies' Welcome Rally for the Albanian Party and Government Delegation

Mao Zedong's China Determines the General Course of Contemporary World History

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has historical significance for the entire international communist movement and all oppressed nations. The attitude one takes towards it is the touchstone for distinguishing Marxist-Leninists from revisionists and opportunists, and for distinguishing true revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries. The Albanian Party and people have consistently supported the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and will continue to do so.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, October 11th - The full text of Comrade Shehu's speech at the rally welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation in Shanghai is as follows:

Dear Comrade Kang Sheng, Dear Comrade Li Fuchun, Dear Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, Dear Revolutionary Heroes of Shanghai, Dear Soldiers and Officers of the Glorious People's Liberation Army of Shanghai, Dear Revolutionary Pioneers of the Red Guards, Sisters and Brothers,

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation feels honored and fortunate to be able to convey to you, the participants of this grand gathering of Albanian-Chinese friendship, and through you, to all revolutionary masses, to the great Chinese people, to the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its great leader, the most beloved friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the most fervent revolutionary greetings from the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and our most beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Shanghai, this great city with a glorious revolutionary tradition, is the cradle of the great Chinese revolution: forty-six years ago, the heroic Chinese Communist Party was founded here. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, it led the great Chinese people through stormy seas to victory in the revolution and established the People's Republic of China. Today, it is resolutely leading the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, confidently advancing along the path of building socialism and communism in China. Shanghai has not changed color and will never change its red hue.

You, the heroic revolutionary cadres of Shanghai armed with the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, after thoroughly smashing the conspiracy of a handful of top power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road and exposing their true revisionist faces, have also smashed their hostile plots and tricks, such as bourgeois "economism," various schemes and deceptions, and overthrown and buried their entire set of bourgeois revisionist lines. You have achieved great unity among all revolutionary organizations of the proletariat, established the Shanghai Revolutionary Workers' Headquarters, and thus set a great example for the revolutionary masses throughout China. You have once again shown your unwavering loyalty to the socialist revolution, to the Chinese Communist Party, and to the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao Zedong.

The working class of Albania, the Communist Party members of Albania, and all the Albanian people enthusiastically congratulate the great victory of the revolutionary cadres of Shanghai. They regard this as a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and a great victory for the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. They see this victory as their own victory.

During our stay in your country, we have been completely immersed in the atmosphere of goodwill, joy, enthusiasm, and sincere love from the revolutionary masses and Party and government leaders. This atmosphere is indescribable in words. The great honor you have bestowed upon our delegation belongs to the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha. This proves that the friendship between our two revolutionary peoples and the two Marxist-Leninist parties is deep, sincere, eternal, and unbreakable. We believe that our delegation's visit will help further strengthen our great friendship.

Our people and Party regard the friendship with the great People's Republic of China, with the seven hundred million Chinese people, and with the Chinese Communist Party led by Mao Zedong as one of our greatest historical victories. The basis of our friendship is the great thought of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Our friendship was forged by the glorious Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Our friendship has withstood all tests and storms. This friendship has no geographical distance, and no force in the world can destroy even a single bit of this great friendship. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his historic telegram to our Party's Fifth Congress last November: "We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends with honeyed words and daggers hidden behind, nor are we two-faced. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests." Comrade Mao Zedong's historic telegram has become a source of continuously strengthening the friendship between our two peoples and parties, greatly inspiring our people and Party to advance together along our common revolutionary path, the path to socialism and communism as indicated by the beacon of Marxism-Leninism.

Dear Comrades, allow me to express, on behalf of our Party and government and all the Albanian people, our heartfelt thanks to the Chinese Communist Party and government, to the great Chinese people and their glorious leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, for the words Comrade Kang Sheng spoke to our Party and people, and for the support to the People's Republic of Albania. This once again embodies the great brotherly friendship between our two countries and peoples, and it highly embodies proletarian internationalism in action, greatly inspiring and encouraging our people in their struggle to defend the motherland and build socialism.

We also sincerely thank you for your magnificent welcome. We assure you that in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism, and in the common struggle for the invincible thought of Marxism-Leninism, the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Hoxha will always hold high the banner of our great friendship; no matter what situation arises, no matter what storms come, they will always be the loyal comrades of the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Our delegation is visiting your country on the occasion of the great national day celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The great victory of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have dealt a heavy blow to international imperialism and reactionaries following the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia.

Our delegation is visiting your great country at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is in full swing and has already achieved extraordinary great victories. These victories not only have historical significance for the People's Republic of China but also have historical significance for the entire international communist movement and all oppressed nations. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the most important historical event of our time. It has shaken the imperialist and revisionist world and the entire international reactionary forces, giving great courage to the peoples of all countries oppressed by imperialism and capitalism, to the peoples of all countries brutally ruled by revisionist cliques, and to all revolutionaries in the world.

On this occasion, on behalf of the Albanian people and our Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, we extend our most heartfelt congratulations to your country for the great victories already achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We also sincerely wish you greater victories in this revolution of world-historical significance, following the path and strategy determined by the great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, for the benefit of the Chinese people, the socialist revolution in China, the world revolution, and the peoples of all countries.

The People's Republic of China, in its 18 years since its founding, has followed the Marxist-Leninist teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and achieved great victories in the construction of socialism, becoming a powerful socialist country. It plays a decisive role in determining the general course of contemporary world history.

Since the revisionist clique led by Khrushchev seized the leadership of the Soviet Party and state, and the revisionist tragedy occurred in the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong's great China has raised higher the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the banner of revolution, which the Soviet revisionists had abandoned. Today, it has become an impregnable fortress of world socialism and communism. The all-round development and progress of the People's Republic of China in various fields have greatly advanced the world revolution and the liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries, further deepening the contradictions among the imperialists, further deepening the contradictions among the countries ruled by revisionists, causing various forces to further split, and powerfully promoting the demarcation between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, and between the peoples of all countries and the friends and enemies of revolution.

The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists cannot realize their evil plan to dominate the world without overcoming the "Chinese obstacle." Therefore, imperialism and revisionism concentrate all their efforts to oppose Mao Zedong's People's China: internationally isolating and "containing" China, domestically nurturing bourgeois, reactionary, and revisionist forces in China, using China's "Trojan horse," the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, to "take the fortress from within."

The Chinese Khrushchev has long been active, opposing the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. He has organized and opposed, forming a second line, a revisionist line serving the domestic and international bourgeoisie, to counter the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong. Given the opportunity, he also wanted to do in China what Khrushchev did in the Soviet Union: to make China return from the socialist path to the revisionist, capitalist reactionary path.

Without the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong, the time bomb buried within the People's China could explode at any time, turning the achievements of the revolution and socialism into ashes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has smashed the evil conspiracy and activities of the Chinese Khrushchev, smashed the evil plan of modern revisionism to "take the fortress from within" in China, and smashed the hope of imperialism to restore capitalism in China. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong is a glorious and great Marxist-Leninist. Therefore, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is glorious and of world-historical significance. Glory to Comrade Mao Zedong! Glory to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!

The struggle between the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the reactionary revisionist black line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, like a red thread, runs through the entire process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the concentrated expression of class struggle, and is the concentrated expression of the life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism.

Class struggle, under certain conditions and environments, may take and has taken in practice extremely sharp and fierce forms. Throughout the entire historical period of socialist society, it has not ended and has not been extinguished. Because the overthrown and expropriated exploiting classes, and their remnants, with the support of the international bourgeoisie, have never given up resisting and trying to restore their "lost paradise" to realize their dream of restoring capitalism; because even after the socialist transformation, new bourgeois elements and anti-socialist elements of this or that quantity are regenerated; because in socialist society, the remnants and influences of the old world, that is, the influences of bourgeois ideology that drag people backward and towards capitalism, will still exist for a long time; and finally, because the capitalist world still exists and continuously exerts harmful pressure from outside on the countries that have established proletarian dictatorship.

To deny class struggle under the socialist system, as the revisionists, including the Chinese Khrushchev, have done, is to be a lackey of the bourgeoisie, to be working for the counter-revolution. Comrade Hoxha said at our Party's Fifth Congress: "To recognize or not to recognize class struggle in socialist society is a principle question, it is the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists, between revolutionaries and traitors to the revolution."

Throughout the entire historical period of building socialism, class struggle is an objective reality and is inevitable. It is taking place in all areas of life. Class struggle in the ideological realm is particularly complex, difficult, long-term, and fierce. Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out many times that the question of who will win in the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism has not been resolved, and in this regard, the struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology will continue for a long time. To give up ideological struggle is a serious and unforgivable mistake. Comrade Mao Zedong has said: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely."

The historical significance and achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China lie precisely in its shattering and rooting out the attempts of these revisionist, bourgeois enemy forces to restore capitalism on the weakest front, the ideological and cultural front. It has dealt a devastating blow to the old feudal and bourgeois ideological and cultural strongholds and the authority of the bourgeoisie in the fields of culture, art, and science, consolidating the ideological and cultural strongholds of the proletariat in China, establishing a great school for conducting communist revolutionary education for hundreds of millions of laboring masses, and raising their socialist class consciousness to the highest level. This great revolution that deeply touches the souls of the people is destroying all the foundations and blocking all the channels for the spread of bourgeois and revisionist degeneration and the restoration of capitalism.

The bourgeois revisionist elements within the Party and state who are taking the capitalist road, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals, concentrate all their efforts to first strike at the leader of the Chinese working class and all the people—the revolutionary headquarters, the Chinese Communist Party, trying to sabotage it from within, making it deviate from the Marxist-Leninist line and teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, trying to usurp the leadership of the Party and state, and ultimately achieve the restoration of capitalism. This is a trick often used by the enemies of revolution and socialism because they know very well that without its revolutionary vanguard, the working class is disarmed in front of the bourgeoisie, leading to the inevitable failure of the working class's cause.

The great teachers of Marxism-Leninism have pointed out, and the entire history of the international communist movement has proven and is proving, that maintaining the purity of the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line of the proletarian party, maintaining the highest vigilance against all deviations and conducting merciless struggle, and expelling all kinds of opportunists from the Party's ranks, are matters of life and death, because without a completely revolutionary party, a party that is as solid as a rock and united on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, the cause of revolution and socialism is doomed to failure.

The great Lenin said: "If there are reformists and Mensheviks in one's own ranks, one cannot achieve victory in the proletarian revolution, one cannot defend the proletarian revolution."

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his meeting with the Albanian Party and government delegation last May, quoting this great principle of Marxism-Leninism, expounded on the maintenance of the purity of the ranks of the working-class party, said that bamboo shoots must be peeled layer by layer, and when peeled to the inside, they are good. Then, when talking about the struggle against those in power taking the capitalist road, he said, if you don't beat them, they won't fall. I think it's like a house, if you don't sweep it, the dust won't run away, if you don't wash your face, it will definitely be covered in dust. You don't wash your face, and the dust is living comfortably on your face. This is a great teaching.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has completely shattered the dangerous attempt of this handful of enemies—the top power-holders within the Party and state who are taking the capitalist road. These enemies at that time tried to use their positions to achieve counter-revolutionary goals. The great victories achieved so far by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are a guarantee for achieving the final victory on the basis of the great strategic deployment personally formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised the role of hundreds of millions of laboring masses, who are fighting resolutely under the illumination of the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, to overthrow the power usurped by these bourgeois revisionist elements and completely place it under the direct control of the revolutionary masses, thus preserving proletarian dictatorship and making it inviolable, and further consolidating and strengthening proletarian dictatorship.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great unity of the revolutionary masses—the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and revolutionary youth—is strengthening, and the three-in-one combination of revolutionary mass organizations, the People's Liberation Army units, and revolutionary leading cadres of the Party and state organs is also strengthening, to overthrow the top power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

One of the most fundamental characteristics of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the active participation of hundreds of millions of masses, the scale of which is unprecedented in any country in the world, and the source of which lies in Comrade Mao Zedong's unlimited trust in the laboring masses, in the people. Comrade Mao Zedong has said: "What is the real copper wall and iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real copper wall and iron wall, which no force can break, which can never be broken. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution."

The active participation of hundreds of millions of broad masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is one of the greatest historical victories of the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. Because the fate of socialism, whether the country advances along the path of socialism and communism or returns to the capitalist system, ultimately depends on the awakening of the masses, their political and ideological qualities, their revolutionary vigilance, alertness, and action.

The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries maliciously slander the Red Guards, which shows that they are terrified of the Red Guards because the Red Guards are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. And this is a good thing for the revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong has said: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggles of the masses and grow up in the storms of revolution." The Red Guards are such successors.

The revisionist clique is afraid of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, afraid of Comrade Mao Zedong's strategy to overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev and his followers, such as Peng Dehuai, Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, Tao Zhu, and others. Therefore, Brezhnev howls like a wolf, opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Comrade Mao Zedong. For the revolutionary camp, this is also a good thing.

We believe that the attitude one takes towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the touchstone for distinguishing Marxist-Leninists from revisionists and opportunists, and for distinguishing true revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries. To remain silent on such a major event of world-historical significance is to have no clear stance on the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads; to rise up and oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is to stand on the side of the bourgeois revisionist forces in China, supporting their goal of burying the People's Republic of China with their anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-socialist reactionary line.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have consistently supported the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and will continue to do so. They are happy for your victories in this great revolution of historical significance. This revolution is a logical continuation of the Chinese revolution that began on October 1, 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China; they are happy for your victories in all areas of life, just as they are for their own victories; and they sincerely wish you greater victories on the revolutionary path illuminated by the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong.

Dear brothers and sisters,

When you launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in this great country of China and achieved great victories in this revolution, the Albanian people, on the distant Adriatic coast, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, are experiencing a great process of further comprehensive revolutionization of national life. The major documents issued by our Party in recent years are not accidental; they are the product of the revolutionary moment of our country's uninterrupted revolution, the product of our country's historical environment and specific conditions, and the product of the Party's Marxist-Leninist understanding and the people's wishes and maturity. Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "Our revolution is a profound proletarian revolution. Our reforms are not simple reforms, but a real revolution led by a revolutionary party armed with revolutionary theory, a revolution of the revolutionary people to fundamentally destroy the old world and build socialism and communism."

In the process of further comprehensive revolutionization of national life, the revolutionary movements, measures, and initiatives that have emerged in our country as a component of our uninterrupted revolution, are mainly aimed at solving the various contradictions that inevitably exist in our socialist society through revolutionary means: the contradictions between the various components of the superstructure and the base, the contradictions between the productive forces and the socialist relations of production, the contradictions between the leading cadres and the masses, the contradictions between individual interests and collective interests, and so on.

Our Party and government, according to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and based on the specific conditions of our country, have taken and are taking revolutionary measures whose essence is to further consolidate our socialist social system and state system, to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to eliminate all phenomena in social life and people's minds that could become the basis for bourgeois degeneration, the production of revisionism, and the restoration of capitalism. All these revolutionary measures ultimately aim to ensure the complete victory of socialism in Albania, to prevent Albania from ever retreating to the capitalist path, and to advance forever along the path of socialism and communism.

Historical experience shows that socialist countries that have established proletarian dictatorship and then had their Party and state leadership usurped by revisionists, the main reason is internal factors. Our Party has learned from this historical fact, while not underestimating external dangers, it primarily focuses on internal factors to continuously strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We proceed from the principle that as long as the domestic political and ideological situation is healthy, no external factor can overthrow our Party, power, and people, and capitalism cannot be reestablished in our country. Therefore, while we do not underestimate external dangers and are always fully prepared to deal with any external danger, we primarily focus on internal factors, that is, to comprehensively consolidate our domestic situation.

This great process of further comprehensive revolutionization of national life is carried out through class struggle, that is, against the remnants of the overthrown exploiting classes, against the enemy elements that have emerged in our ranks, against the capitalist remnants in people's minds, and against the influence of bourgeois ideology. This comprehensive class struggle, as the great driving force of our socialist society, has greatly raised the political awareness of the Party, cadres, and masses, and their revolutionary vigilance.

In our country, the struggle to root out bureaucracy is being continuously carried out. Everyone knows that bureaucracy itself is a serious danger that creates favorable conditions for the production of revisionism. In this regard, based on the Party's continuous and in-depth implementation of the mass line and the basic policy of always emphasizing proletarian politics in everything, fundamental measures are being implemented: to make the organs of power closer to the broad masses of the people, to make the laboring masses widely participate in all social activities and state affairs, to fully develop the initiative and direct action of the masses, to strengthen the supervision of the people over the leading organs and leading cadres at all levels, and to prevent anyone from using their power to place themselves above the people and the interests of the people.

In the fields of ideology and culture, we are implementing a series of important measures aimed at eradicating the remnants and influences of bourgeois and revisionist morality and ideology, eradicating feudal superstitions and their worldview, eradicating backward customs and habits, and eradicating all reactionary phenomena and influences that still exist in people's minds. The great class education movement for the laboring masses, especially for the young generation who will take over the revolution and pass on the revolutionary baton, has gained particularly wide development. This great class education process is being carried out under the Party's slogan of "thinking, working, and living like a revolutionary."

The army is the main weapon of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our Party and government's attention in the military field is focused on comprehensively strengthening the army and conducting political and ideological training and military training for all laboring masses, so that all the people are prepared and able to defend the motherland. The revolutionary fighting slogan of our Party, "one hand with a pickaxe, one hand with a gun, building socialism," is the basis for the work and life of the Albanian people.

In the fields of education, art, and culture, the Party and people's government, with the active participation and support of the laboring masses, have been and are implementing effective measures and are effectively carrying out the struggle for further revolutionization and strengthening the proletarian character, in order to eliminate all bourgeois and revisionist influences in the fields of education, art, and culture, to closely link them with life and practice, and to make them better serve the people, the revolution, and the socialist cause.

To implement Lenin's teaching on "only by working together with the workers and peasants can one become a true communist" and Comrade Enver Hoxha's instruction on "...when we talk about working with a socialist attitude, correctly understanding that physical labor and productive labor have primary importance," all levels of Party and government leading cadres, all intellectual workers, together with the workers and peasants, directly participate in productive labor, has become a universal regulation in our country, while school youth are engaged in large-scale voluntary labor for the construction of socialism. The participation of cadres at all levels, intellectuals, and young students in productive labor has great ideological significance because it can make cadres closer to the people. This is the most effective means of revolutionary education for them, against individualism, laziness, the pursuit of fame and wealth, the pursuit of officialdom, and bureaucracy (which makes people degenerate into revisionism and the bourgeoisie), and the most effective means of gradually narrowing the gap between physical labor and mental labor.

In the fields of social relations and production relations, we have also taken many measures to further revolutionize national life, which have great significance for further developing the productive forces, for conducting revolutionary class education for the laboring masses, for consolidating the new moral standards of people in labor, production, family, and society, for making people's relations conform to our socialist ideology, and for the development of the country towards communism.

The movement for further comprehensive revolutionization of national life is developing irresistibly and vigorously. This development process is proceeding on the correct, Marxist-Leninist path. This is a component of our country's revolution. Our country's revolution has not stopped and will never stop because our Labor Party is leading the revolution. Our Party has the correct Marxist-Leninist line, Marxist-Leninist strategy and tactics, and the iron-like unity of the Party's ranks. The unity of our Party has been tempered in the relentless and fierce struggle against the enemies of the Party.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out in his historic speech on February 6th of this year:

"...our Party is a strong Party, a Party that is united in thought and action with the iron unity of Marxism-Leninism, it does not allow internal opposition, it does not allow anti-Marxist, revisionist, Trotskyist, liberalist, and social democratic factions. Our Party, in formulating its strategy and tactics, has always been based on Marxist-Leninist theory, on the objective situation of our country, combining the characteristics and time, conducting dialectical materialism and historical materialism analysis.... Our Party has always maintained the purity of its ranks as a proletarian party should, this requires overcoming countless difficulties to achieve the ultimate goal.... Our Party has never allowed enemy activities within the Party, our Party has never abandoned the method of patient explanation and persuasion towards those who betray the Party and take the anti-Party, anti-people path, but when the limit is reached and there is concrete evidence, the Party does not hesitate to expel them, to hand over those who engage in subversion to the court, and some have been executed." To strengthen the unity of the Party's ranks, our Party has done and will always do this, and will not be able to achieve anything if it does not do this, and it will threaten the existence of the Party itself and the conduct of the revolution.

Our people have launched a high tide to complete the tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan proposed by the Party's Fifth Congress. This year is the second year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The tasks of this plan are being completed victoriously, and many tasks are being overfulfilled. In our socialist construction, the People's Republic of China has generously aided us. The Albanian people, our Party and government, thank the brotherly Chinese people and the Communist Party and government for this truly brotherly, selfless internationalist aid.

Dear brothers and sisters!

The current development of the international situation is favorable to the socialist revolution and the forces of Marxism-Leninism. Imperialism, revisionism, and world reactionaries are suffering heavy defeats, and their foundations are increasingly shaky.

The twists and turns and local retreats of the revolutionary liberation movements in this or that country do not change the historical direction of the inevitable occurrence of revolution.

Facts have proven that whether it is armed aggression, dollars, neo-colonialism, or the betrayal of revisionism, they have not and will not stop the rising tide of anti-imperialist national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The revolution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which make up the majority of the world's population, is boiling and has become the main focus of antagonistic contradictions within the imperialist system and the weakest link in the chain of world imperialism. Today, American imperialism plays the role of the international gendarme, and it has to disperse its forces around the world. This is the greatest and insurmountable weakness of American imperialism, which stretches its bloody claws everywhere, thus placing itself directly under the blows of the peoples of all countries.

American imperialism's aggression in many countries, such as in Greece, the neighboring country of Albania, to establish reactionary fascist military rule, does not indicate the strength of American imperialism, but rather its weakness, indicating its fear of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries.

In the capitalist lair of the world—Europe, North America, etc., the internal and external antagonistic contradictions of the capitalist system, economic contradictions and class contradictions, and the antagonistic contradictions among the imperialist powers are becoming increasingly sharp.

Under this tense international situation, the modern revisionists centered around the Khrushchev-style leadership of the Soviet Union—these shameless scoundrels who make a living by betraying the interests of the working class—are facing unprecedented great difficulties in their traitorous careers, suffering continuous defeats, and being surrounded by the deep contradictions they have created with their own actions.

The contradictions among the revisionist cliques are also intensifying, and the Khrushchev-style leadership of the Soviet Union is increasingly losing control over its satellite countries. The revisionist front is like a tattered black garment, full of holes.

On the contrary, the Marxist-Leninist forces of the world are growing stronger. In the countries temporarily ruled by the revisionist traitor clique, including the Soviet Union, these forces are organizing, tempering, preparing, and continuously strengthening.

The development of international affairs shows that the division of world forces is becoming clearer, and the peoples of all countries are increasingly distinguishing between enemies and friends, and they are increasingly believing that, as Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out, imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries are paper tigers.

Victory will inevitably belong to the peoples of all countries, to the revolution, to socialism, and to Marxism-Leninism. As Marxism-Leninism teaches, as Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out, and as the development of human history has proven, this victory will inevitably come from the barrel of a gun.

The victorious progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China clearly proves the upsurge of the world revolutionary movement, proves the upsurge of socialism, and proves the development of Marxism-Leninism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shattered the hopes of the imperialists and the modern revisionists in China, and it is the heaviest blow to revisionism and world imperialism in the current historical period. Internationally, the spearhead of this revolution is directed at imperialism, first and foremost at American imperialism, and at modern revisionism, first and foremost at the Soviet revisionist leadership. There is no doubt that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will bring the anti-imperialist revolutionary movements of the oppressed peoples of all countries, the development of the international communist movement, the struggle of the international proletariat against capitalist oppression, and the struggle of Marxist-Leninists against modern revisionists into a new high tide.

However, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries will not accept their defeat and will not lay down their arms, as long as they have not entered the grave, they will use all means to resist.

Comrade Mao Zedong has said: "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, until annihilation—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic. This is a Marxist law." Countless practices have proven the words of Comrade Mao Zedong.

The great People's China stands at the forefront of the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and its running dogs. Today, it has become an insurmountable Great Wall against the plans of imperialism and revisionism to dominate the world. The American imperialists, the Khrushchev revisionists, and their accomplices have directed their main forces and the main thrust of their conspiracies against the great People's China. They are making frantic efforts to build an "iron quarantine zone" around China; they are bringing the war closer to China. Johnson and Kosygin's talks in Glassboro have again plotted new conspiracies against the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people.

In the current international situation where the world's reactionaries led by the American imperialists and the Soviet traitor clique are frantically opposing the great Chinese people who are holding high the banner of socialism and revolution, and opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the attitude towards the People's Republic of China is the touchstone for proletarian internationalism, for socialism and communism. The sacred internationalist duty of all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries in the world is to spare no effort to defend the People's China, to unreservedly defend and support the general line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the general line of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

We are fully convinced that all the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries against the People's Republic of China will fail, and that the great People's China led by Mao Zedong will forever defeat all enemies. The Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the government of the People's Republic of Albania, whether in good times or in difficult times, will always be the inseparable, loyal comrades of the great Chinese people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and Comrade Mao Zedong. We will always fight together and win together.

Comrades,

The Vietnam War most clearly exposes the aggressive nature of American imperialism, most clearly shows that American imperialism cannot defeat the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting bravely; at the same time, it most clearly shows that the Soviet revisionist leadership has completely betrayed the brotherly Vietnamese people and all the people of the world who love freedom.

The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are trying every means to force the heroic Vietnamese people to surrender through "peace talks." Kosygin and Johnson plotted to bury the Vietnamese people in Glassboro.

We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people will persist in armed struggle to the end, unyielding, and will surely win.

The Middle East events, the aggression of imperialism-Israel against the Arab countries, have exposed the nature of American imperialism as a schemer and aggressor, and at the same time have exposed the treachery and traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionists. Although the Arab people have suffered defeats, they have not given up the struggle. If they unite against imperialism, do not place their hopes on the Soviet revisionists, and do not be deceived by the old imperialist agent Joseph Broz Tito, they can achieve victory in the struggle.

Every day there are new facts and new evidence of the criminal collusion of the Soviet revisionist leadership with the American imperialists' evil plan to dominate the world. One of the recent facts is that the main topic of the criminal deal between Kosygin and Johnson in Glassboro is undoubtedly the so-called "non-proliferation treaty" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This treaty is a new big step taken by the Soviet revisionist leadership on the traitorous road designed by Nikita Khrushchev, which is against the interests of the peoples of all countries, and its purpose is to legalize the nuclear monopoly of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

However, the "non-proliferation treaty" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is doomed to fail, first of all because the People's Republic of China has now appeared on the international stage as a nuclear power, which completely shatters the nuclear monopoly of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Our people, our Party and government, together with all the revolutionary peoples of the world, enthusiastically welcome the brilliant achievements of the People's Republic of China in the fields of nuclear weapons and thermonuclear weapons, and wish the national defense forces of the People's Republic of China to continue to strengthen, for the benefit of all mankind.

Whether it is the People's Republic of China or the People's Republic of Albania, we both follow a truly peaceful foreign policy. Socialist Albania does not threaten any country and does not bully anyone, but many arrows are directed at socialist Albania, which is geographically surrounded by capitalist-imperialist and revisionist Europe, and many conspiracies have been plotted against it. We know this and are watching, and we are prepared to withstand everything. If one day the foreign enemies dare to invade the borders of the People's Republic of Albania, they should know that whoever enters Albania will not be able to leave alive, socialist Albania will become the grave of all invaders, the fighting fire of Albania is not limited by regions, socialist Albania has many loyal and great friends in the world. The greatest, strongest, and most loyal friend and ally of the Albanian people is the great people of China, who are educated in the pure feelings of proletarian internationalism by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong.

Comrades!

The revolutionaries and peoples of the world will soon celebrate the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, opened the era of the victory of a new social system without oppression and exploitation, opened the era of socialism and communism.

The Albanian Labor Party has resolutely smashed the deceptive conspiracy of the Soviet revisionist clique to seize the great banner of the October Socialist Revolution that they have already thrown into the mud. The true heirs of the great thought and cause of Lenin and Stalin's great October Revolution are the Marxist-Leninist parties and forces that are waging uncompromising struggle against the revisionist traitors, defending and developing the great cause of the October Revolution.

We are firmly convinced that the Soviet people, the revolutionary communists of the Soviet Union, will not tolerate the traitorous clique of Khrushchev for long, will overthrow and decisively defeat the revisionist traitors, and will follow the great example of the October Socialist Revolution and the example of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and wage decisive struggles, revolutionary struggles. They will inherit the glorious tradition of the October Revolution and bring the Soviet Union back to the path of Marxism-Leninism and communism.

The task of all Marxist-Leninists and true revolutionaries in all countries is to continue to strengthen their resolute and open struggle against modern revisionism led by the Khrushchev-style leaders of the Soviet Union. They must draw a clear line of demarcation with the revisionists and their organizations, especially with the Soviet leadership clique, and rise up to wage a merciless struggle against the revisionist traitors, aiming to prevent the revisionist traitors from achieving their counter-revolutionary goals, to expose them, to isolate them, to overthrow them, and to smash them.

Today, the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism is as clear as daylight. Nothing unites true Marxist-Leninists with modern revisionists, everything separates them. If you imagine that the revisionists can return to the path of Marxism-Leninism, or think that one can take joint action with the modern revisionists to help the Vietnamese people, or believe that one can stand on a seemingly anti-imperialist common front with the modern revisionists, this means that you are playing with revisionism, sliding to the position of revisionism, and bringing incalculable losses to the cause of revolution and socialism.

Dear comrades, brothers and sisters, finally, allow me to once again express, on behalf of the Albanian Labor Party, the working class, the cooperative farmers, the people's intellectuals, the people's army, and all the Albanian people, our solidarity and complete support for your great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, your glorious struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and the construction of socialist society, and wish you new brilliant achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the implementation of the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese people and the Albanian people, between the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live the seven hundred million Chinese people!

Long live the invincible fortress of socialism and revolution, the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its great leader, the most respected friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the victory of the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!

Long live the red people of Shanghai, the heroes of the people who are at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, loyal to the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong!

Glory to Marxism-Leninism!

　　谢胡同志在上海革命人民和驻沪三军欢迎阿党政代表团大会上讲话
　　毛泽东的中国确定当代世界历史的总航程
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命对整个国际共产主义运动和世界所有被压迫民族都具有历史性意义。对它采取什么态度，是今天区分马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者、机会主义者，区分真革命和反革命的试金石。阿劳动党和人民一贯支持无产阶级文化大革命，并将支持到底。
    新华社上海十一日电　谢胡同志在上海革命人民和驻沪三军欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的康生同志，亲爱的李富春同志，亲爱的张春桥同志，亲爱的上海革命的英雄工人、亲爱的上海光荣的人民
    解放军指战员、亲爱的上海红卫兵闯将，姐妹们，兄弟们，
    阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团感到幸福和光荣的是，能够向你们，这个盛大的阿中友好群众集会的参加者，向你们，首先点燃中国无产阶级文化大革命烈火，第一个成立革命委员会，从而成为中国无产阶级文化大革命中的榜样和先锋的英雄上海红色革命派，并且通过你们，向所有无产阶级革命派，向伟大的中国人民，向光荣的中国共产党及其伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最敬爱的朋友毛泽东主席，转达阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和我们最敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志最热烈的革命敬意。
    上海，你们这个具有光荣的革命传统的大城市，是伟大中国革命的摇篮：四十六年以前，在这里成立了英雄的中国共产党，她在毛泽东同志的领导下，在惊涛骇浪中，领导伟大的中国人民，取得了革命的胜利，成立了中华人民共和国；今天，她正坚决地领导中国人民进行着无产阶级文化大革命，满怀信心地沿着中国建设社会主义和共产主义的道路前进。上海没有变色，也永远不会改变她鲜红的颜色。
    你们，用毛泽东主席伟大思想武装起来的上海英雄的革命派，在根本粉碎了党内一小撮最大的走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，并揭露了他们修正主义的真面目之后，又粉碎了他们敌对性的阴谋伎俩，如资产阶级“经济主义”，各种各样的阴谋诡计和欺骗宣传，打倒并埋葬了他们一整套的资产阶级修正主义路线，实现了各无产阶级革命组织的大联合，成立了上海革命工人总部，从而为全中国的革命群众作出了伟大的榜样。你们再一次地表明了你们是毫不动摇地忠于社会主义革命，忠于中国共产党和忠于毛泽东主席伟大的马克思列宁主义思想的。
    阿尔巴尼亚的工人阶级、阿尔巴尼亚的共产党员和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈地祝贺上海红色革命派的这一伟大胜利，认为这是中国无产阶级文化大革命的重大胜利，是毛泽东同志思想的重大胜利。他们把这个胜利看作是自己的胜利。
    我们在你们国家的这些日子里，完全是置身于革命群众和党政领导人对我们的一片好客、欢乐、热情、火一般的同情心和真诚的热爱的气氛之中，这种气氛，是我们用语言所无法形容的。你们给予我们代表团的这样一种巨大的荣誉，归于阿尔巴尼亚人民和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。这证明我们两国革命人民和两个马克思列宁主义政党之间的友谊，是深厚的、赤诚的、永恒的和牢不可破的。我们相信，我们代表团的访问将有助于进一步巩固我们的伟大友谊。
    我国人民和我们党把同伟大的人民中国、同七亿中国人民和同毛泽东的中国共产党的友谊，看作是自己最伟大的历史胜利之一。我们友谊的基础是马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的伟大思想。我们的友谊是以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党缔造的。
    我们的友谊经历过一切考验和急风暴雨。这个友谊没有地理的距离，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这个伟大友谊的一分一毫。毛泽东同志在他给我们党去年十一月的第五次代表大会的历史性贺电中说过：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”毛泽东同志历史性的贺电成了不断加强我们两国人民、两党之间友谊的源泉，大大地鼓舞着我国人民和我们党永远一起沿着我们共同的革命的道路，也就是马克思列宁主义的明灯向我们指出的社会主义和共产主义的道路前进。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我代表我们的党和政府，代表全体阿尔巴尼亚人民向中国共产党和中国政府，向伟大的中国人民及其光荣的领袖毛泽东同志表示最衷心的感谢，感谢康生同志对我们党和人民所说的一切话，感谢对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的支持。这再一次体现了我们两国和两国人民之间的伟大的兄弟友谊，高度地在行动上体现了无产阶级国际主义，大大地激励和鼓舞着我国人民进行保卫祖国和建设社会主义的斗争。
    我们也衷心地感谢你们对我们盛大无比的欢迎。我们向你们保证：在争取社会主义和共产主义的胜利、争取战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想的共同斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚人民和以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，将永远高举我们的伟大友谊的旗帜；不管出现什么情况，遇到什么风浪，他们都将永远是伟大的中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的忠实同志。
    我们代表团是在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的伟大节日的时候，来到你们的国家进行友好访问的。在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下取得的伟大中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，是继俄国伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利后，对国际帝国主义和反动派的一个最沉重的打击。
    我们代表团来到你们伟大的国家，正当毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命处在充分开展并且已经取得了异常巨大胜利的时候，这些胜利不仅对人民中国具有历史意义，而且对于整个的国际共产主义运动和世界所有的被压迫民族同样具有历史性的意义。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是当代最重大的历史事件，它震撼了帝国主义和修正主义世界，震撼了整个的国际反动派，给了受帝国主义和资本主义压迫的各国人民、受修正主义集团野蛮统治的各国人民、世界所有的革命者以巨大的勇气。
    我们代表团乘此机会，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民和我们的劳动党以及霍查同志，最衷心地祝贺你们国家的无产阶级文化大革命直到今天已经取得的伟大胜利，并且衷心预祝你们在这场具有世界历史意义的革命中，按伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志所确定的道路和战略取得越来越巨大的胜利，以造福于中国人民、中国的社会主义革命、世界革命和世界的各国人民。
    中华人民共和国在她成立后的十八年中，遵循毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义学说，在社会主义建设的道路上，取得了伟大的胜利，变成了一个强大的社会主义国家，对确定当代世界历史总的航程的行进，起着决定性的作用。
      自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导，苏联发生了这样的修正主义悲剧以后，毛泽东的伟大中国把苏联修正主义者所抛弃的马、恩、列、斯的旗帜，即革命的旗帜，举得更高了，在今天，她变成了世界社会主义和共产主义的坚不可摧的堡垒。中华人民共和国在各个方面势不可挡的发展和进步，大大地推进了世界革命和各国人民的解放斗争，进一步加深了帝国主义者的矛盾，进一步加深了修正主义者当权的各国之间的矛盾，使各种力量进一步分化，有力地促进了划清马克思列宁主义同修正主义之间、各国人民和革命的朋友和敌人之间的界线。
    美帝和苏修，不克服“中国的障碍”，就实现不了它们霸占世界的罪恶企图。所以，帝国主义和修正主义集中全力反对毛泽东的人民中国：在国际上孤立和“遏制”中国，在中国国内豢养资产阶级的、反动的和修正主义的势力，通过中国的“特洛伊木马”即中国的赫鲁晓夫及其帮凶，“从内部”来夺取堡垒。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫很早就进行活动，反对以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线。他进行活动、组织和反对，以致形成了一个第二条的路线，即他的为国内、国际的资产阶级效劳的修正主义路线，来对抗毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的革命路线，一旦有机可乘，也想在中国干赫鲁晓夫在苏联所干过的事情：使中国由社会主义道路走回到修正主义的、资本主义的反动道路上去。
    要是没有毛泽东同志发动的无产阶级文化大革命，人民中国自身埋着的定时炸弹，就可以在任何时候爆炸，把革命和社会主义的业绩化成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的罪恶阴谋和罪恶活动，粉碎了现代修正主义要在中国“从内部”夺取堡垒的罪恶计划，粉碎了帝国主义要在中国复辟资本主义的希望。所以，毛泽东同志是光荣的、伟大的马克思列宁主义者。所以，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是光荣的，是具有世界历史意义的。光荣属于毛泽东同志！光荣属于中国的无产阶级文化大革命！
    以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线对以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动的修正主义黑线的斗争，象一条红线，贯穿整个无产阶级文化大革命的进程，是阶级斗争的集中表现，是工人阶级同资产阶级，社会主义同资本主义两条道路之间生死斗争的集中表现。
    阶级斗争，在一定的条件和环境下，可能采取并且在实践上已经采取极其尖锐和激烈的形式，在社会主义社会的整个历史时期内，并没有完结，并没有熄灭。因为被推翻和被剥夺了的剥削阶级，和他们的残余，还有国际资产阶级的支持，他们从来没有放弃过反抗，放弃恢复“失去了的天堂”的企图，以实现自己复辟资本主义的梦想；因为即使在进行了社会主义改造以后，重新产生这样数量或那样数量的新兴资产阶级分子和反社会主义分子；因为在社会主义社会里，还要在很长的时期内，保持着旧世界的残迹和影响，即把人们拖向后走、走向资本主义的资产阶级思想的影响，最后，因为资本主义世界还仍旧存在，并且不断地从外部对已经建立了无产阶级专政的国家施加毒害性的压力。
    否认社会主义制度下的阶级斗争，正如修正主义者所做的那样，中国的赫鲁晓夫所做的那样，那就是资产阶级的奴才，是在为反革命卖力。霍查同志在我们党的五大上说过：“承认还是不承认社会主义社会的阶级斗争，是一个原则问题，是马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者、革命者和革命的叛徒之间的分界线。”
    在建设社会主义的整个历史时期内，阶级斗争是个客观现实，是不可避免的，在生活的各个领域中进行着。在思想战线上的阶级斗争，尤其复杂、艰难、长期和激烈。毛泽东同志不止一次地指出过，社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有解决，在这方面，同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。放弃思想斗争，那是严重的、不可饶恕的错误。毛泽东同志说过：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的历史意义和历史功绩，恰恰在于它破灭了并且根除了修正主义的、资产阶级的这些敌对势力在最脆弱的战线上即思想文化战线上复辟资本主义的企图，对旧的封建的和资产阶级的思想文化阵地和资产阶级“权威”在文化、艺术、科学方面的阵地，给予了毁灭性的打击，巩固了无产阶级思想文化在中国的阵地，办起了一所对亿万广大劳动群众进行共产主义革命教育的大学校，把他们的社会主义阶级觉悟提到了最新的高度。这场深深触及人们灵魂的大革命，正在摧毁散布资产阶级的和修正主义的蜕化、复辟资本主义的一切基础和堵塞其一切孔道。
    党和国家内走资本主义道路的当权派这些资产阶级修正主义分子，为了实现自己的反革命目的，集中全力来企图首先打击中国工人阶级和全体人民的领导者——革命的司令部中国共产党，企图从内部来破坏它，使它离开毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义路线和学说，企图篡夺党和国家的领导，最后达到复辟资本主义。这是革命和社会主义的敌人所惯用的权术，因为他们知道得非常清楚，要能使工人阶级没有了自己革命的先锋队，那就是使工人阶级在资产阶级面前缴了械，导致工人阶级的事业必然失败。
    马克思列宁主义的伟大导师们指出过，并且国际共产主义运动的全部历史也证明了和正在证明：维护无产阶级的党的马克思列宁主义的革命路线的纯洁性，对一切偏向保持最高度的警惕并进行无情的斗争，从党的队伍里清除出不论那一种的机会主义者，这些都具有生死攸关的意义，因为没有一个完完全全的革命的党，磐石般团结在马克思列宁主义基础上的党，革命和社会主义的事业是注定要失败的。
    伟大的列宁说过：“在自己的队伍里有改良主义者，有孟什维克，就不能在无产阶级革命中取得胜利，就不能捍卫住无产阶级革命。”
    毛泽东同志在去年五月会见阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，引用马克思列宁主义的这一伟大原则，阐述维护工人阶级政党队伍的纯洁性的时候，曾经说，竹笋的皮要一层一层地剥，剥到里面就是好的了。之后，在谈到要对走资本主义道路当权派作斗争时，他又说，你不打，他不倒。我认为，这同房子一样，扫帚不到，灰尘不会跑掉，脸不洗，就一定灰尘满面。你不洗脸，灰尘在脸上过得好好的。这是个伟大的教导。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命完全地打破了这一小撮敌人——党和国家走资本主义道路的当权派的危险企图；这些敌人当时力图利用自己的地位来实现反革命的目的。无产阶级文化大革命迄今已经取得的伟大胜利，对于在毛泽东同志亲自制定的伟大战略部署的基础上，争取最后的胜利，是个保障。
    无产阶级文化大革命提高了亿万劳动群众的作用，他们在毛泽东同志马克思列宁主义思想的照耀下正在坚决斗争，以打倒这些资产阶级修正主义分子所篡夺了的权力，把它完全置于革命群众的直接控制之下，从而保住无产阶级专政，使之不受侵略，并更进一步地巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派——亿万的工农兵群众和知识分子、革命青年群众的大联合正在加强，革命的群众组织、人民解放军部队和党和国家机关的革命领导干部的三结合也正在加强，以打倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派。
    无产阶级文化大革命最根本的特点之一，就是亿万群众的积极参加，其规模是世界上任何国家所没有过的，其根源就在于毛泽东同志对劳动群众、对人民的无限信任。毛泽东同志说过：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    亿万广大群众积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，是毛泽东同志马克思列宁主义思想的最伟大的历史性胜利之一。因为社会主义的命运，国家是沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路前进，还是回到资本主义的制度去，最终是取决于群众的觉悟，政治思想素质、革命的警惕、戒备和行动。
      帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派对红卫兵的恶毒诬蔑，表明了他们对红卫兵怕得要死。因为红卫兵忠于毛泽东思想。而这对革命来说，也是一件大好事。毛泽东同志说：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的”。红卫兵就是这样的接班人。
    修正主义集团害怕无产阶级文化大革命，害怕毛泽东同志打倒中国赫鲁晓夫及其追随者彭德怀、彭真、罗瑞卿、陆定一、陶铸之流的战略，所以，勃列日涅夫就象豺狼一样嚎叫，反对中国的无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东同志。对革命派说来，这又是一件大好事。
      我们认为，对中国无产阶级文化大革命采取什么态度，是今天区分马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者、机会主义者，区分真革命和反革命的试金石。对这样一个具有世界历史意义的重大事件保持沉默，那就是对两个阶级、两条路线和两条道路之间的斗争这样一个生死攸关的原则问题，没有明确的立场；要是起来反对中国的无产阶级文化大革命，那就是站到了中国资产阶级修正主义势力的一边去了，是支持它们的目的在于葬送中华人民共和国的反马克思列宁主义和反社会主义的反动路线。
      阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯支持无产阶级文化大革命，并将支持到底。他们为你们在这场具有历史意义的大革命中所取得的胜利而感到高兴。这场革命是一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立的中国大革命的合乎逻辑的继续；为你们在生活的各个领域中所取得的胜利，就象对我们自己的胜利一样，感到高兴；并衷心地预祝你们在毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想照耀下的革命道路上，取得越来越大的胜利。
    亲爱的兄弟、姊妹们，
    当你们在这伟大的中国发动了无产阶级文化大革命并在这场革命中不断取得伟大胜利的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在遥远的亚得里亚海滨，在劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，正经历着使国家生活进一步全面革命化的伟大进程。我们党近几年来发表的重大文件并不是偶然的，是产生于我国的不断革命所正在进行的革命时刻，产生于我国的历史环境和具体条件，是党的马克思列宁主义认识和人民的愿望与成熟性的产物。恩维尔·霍查同志说过：“我们的革命是一场深刻的无产阶级革命。我们的改革不是简单的改革，而是由一个用革命理论武装起来的革命政党的领导下的革命人民所进行的一场从根本上摧毁旧世界和建立社会主义和共产主义的真正的革命造反。”
    在国家生活进一步全面革命化的过程中，我国连锁地产生的一些革命运动、革命措施和革命倡议，作为我国不断革命的一个组成部分，主要是要通过革命的道路来解决我们社会主义社会所不可避免地存在的多种矛盾：上层建筑的各种成分和基础之间的矛盾，生产力和社会主义生产关系之间的矛盾，领导干部和群众之间的矛盾，个人利益和整体利益之间的矛盾，等等。
    我们党和我国政府，按照马克思列宁主义的教导，根据我国的具体条件，已经和正在采取的革命措施的实质，就是在于进一步巩固我们社会主义的社会制度和国家制度，进一步加强工人阶级专政，清除社会生活中和人们思想中一切可能成为资产阶级蜕化变质、产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的基础的不良现象。所有这些革命措施的最终目的，就是要保证社会主义在阿尔巴尼亚的彻底胜利，使阿尔巴尼亚决不倒退到资本主义道路上去，而要永远沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路前进。
    历史经验证明，曾经建立起无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，而后又被修正主义者篡夺了党和国家的领导，这主要原因是在于内在的因素。我们党从这一历史事实吸取了教训，在丝毫不低估外来危险的同时，首先重视内在因素，来不断加强工人阶级专政。我们是从这样一个原则出发的，这就是：只要国内的政治思想状况是健康的，任何外部因素都打不垮我们的党、政权和人民，资本主义就不可能在我国重新建立。因此，我们在丝毫不低估外来危险，并且时刻作好对付任何外来危险的充分准备的同时，我们首先重视内在因素，也就是全面巩固我们的国内局面。
    我们国家生活的进一步革命化这个伟大进程，是通过下述阶级斗争来进行的，即反对被推翻的剥削阶级的残余，反对我们队伍中产生出来的敌对分子，反对人们头脑中的资本主义残余和反对资产阶级思想的影响。这一全面的阶级斗争，作为我们社会主义社会的伟大动力，最大限度地提高了党的、干部的和群众的政治觉悟，提高了他们的革命警惕性。
    在我国，根除官僚主义的斗争正在不断地进行。大家知道，官僚主义本身就是为产生修正主义创造有利条件的严重危险。在这方面，根据党的不断地深入贯彻群众路线，事事突出无产阶级政治这一基本方针，正在实施一些带有根本性的措施：使政权机关进一步接近广大的人民群众，使劳动群众广泛参与全部的社会活动和国家大事，全面发展群众的首创精神和直接行动，加强人民对各级领导机关和领导干部的监督，防止任何人利用职权把自己放在人民和人民的利益之上。
    在思想和文化方面，我们正在实施一系列的重要措施，目的是为了根除资产阶级和修正主义的道德、思想的残迹和影响，根除封建迷信及其世界观，根除落后的风俗习惯，以及还存在人们头脑中的一切反动的东西和现象。对劳动群众特别是对将要接班并把革命接力棒传下去的年青一代的革命的阶级教育运动，获得了特别广泛的发展。这一伟大的阶级教育过程是在党的“象革命者一样思考、工作和生活”的热情口号下进行的。
    军队是工人阶级专政的主要武器。我们党和政权在军事方面的注意力，集中在全面加强军队和对全体劳动群众进行政治思想训练和军事训练，使全体人民都有准备并有能力保卫祖国。我们党提出的“一手拿镐，一手拿枪，建设社会主义”这一革命的战斗口号，是我国人民工作和生活的依据。
    在教育、艺术和文化方面，党和人民政权，在劳动群众的积极参加和支持下，过去和现在正在贯彻有效的措施，并卓有成效地进行着进一步革命化的斗争和加强无产阶级党性，以便铲除教育、艺术和文化领域中的一切资产阶级和修正主义的不良影响，以紧密联系生活和实际，使它们更好地为人民服务，为革命和社会主义事业服务。
    为贯彻列宁关于“只有在劳动中同工农打成一片，才能成为真正的共产主义者”的教导和恩维尔·霍查同志关于“……当我们谈到以社会主义态度对待劳动时，正确地理解体力劳动和生产劳动具有首要的意义”的指示，各级党政领导干部、所有的脑力劳动者在同工人、农民一起，直接参加生产劳动，已在我国成为普遍的规定，而学校青年则投入了建设社会主义的各种大规模的义务劳动。各级干部，知识分子和青年学生，参加生产劳动具有重大的思想意义，因为这可以使干部接近人民。这是对他们进行革命教育，反对利己主义、贪图安逸、追求名利、做官当老爷、官僚主义（使人蜕化为修正主义和资产阶级的）的最有效的手段，是逐渐缩小体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别最有效的手段。
    在社会关系和生产关系方面，我们也采取了许多使国家生活进一步革命化的措施，这些措施对进一步发展生产力，对劳动群众进行革命的阶级教育，对巩固人们在劳动、生产、家庭、社会中的新的道德准则，对使人们之间的关系符合我们的社会主义意识形态，符合国家向共产主义发展的道路，具有重大的意义。
    我们国家生活的进一步全面革命化的运动正在势不可挡地蓬勃开展，这个发展进程是在正确的、马克思列宁主义的道路上进行。这是我国革命的一个组成部分。我国的革命没有停顿下来，也永远不会停顿，因为我们劳动党在领导着革命。我们党有正确的马克思列宁主义的路线，有马克思列宁主义的战略和策略，有党的队伍的钢铁般的团结。我们党的团结是在同党的敌人不断进行的顽强的激烈斗争中锻炼出来的。
    霍查同志在今年二月六日的历史性讲话中指出：
  “……我们的党是个坚强的党、是在思想和行动上都有着马克思列宁主义钢铁般的团结的党，它不允许内部有反对派，不允许有反马克思主义的、修正主义的、托洛茨基主义的、自由主义的和社会民主党等派别。我们党在制订它的战略策略时，一贯是以马克思列宁主义理论，以我国的客观形势为依据的，结合着特点和时间、进行辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的分析。……党一贯象无产阶级政党所应当保持的那样，保持着自己队伍的纯洁。这需要绕过千难万险才能达到最终目的。……我党从不允许在党内进行敌对活动，我党从未放弃对叛党和走上反党反人民道路的人进行耐心的解释、说服的工作方法，但到了一定限度并有确凿的事实时，党就毫不犹豫地清除他们，把进行颠覆的人提交法庭，有些则被枪毙了。”为了加强党的队伍的团结，我们党从过去到现在都是这样做的，并将永远这样做，不这样做，就将一事无成，将威胁党自身的存在和革命的进行。
    我国人民，掀起了完成党的第五次代表大会提出的第四个五年计划任务的高潮。今年是第四个五年计划的第二年。这个计划的各项任务正在胜利完成，许多方面的任务正在超额完成。在我国社会主义建设中，中华人民共和国慷慨地援助了我们。阿尔巴尼亚人民，我们党和政府，感谢兄弟中国人民及共产党和政府所提供的这一真正兄弟般的、无私的国际主义援助。
    亲爱的兄弟姊妹们！
    当前国际形势的发展有利于社会主义革命和马克思列宁主义的力量。帝国主义、修正主义和世界反动派正在遭到惨重的失败，它们脚下的根基正在日益动摇。
    在这个或那个国家，革命解放运动的曲折和局部退却，改变不了革命必将发生的历史发展的总方向。
    事实证明，无论是武装侵略、美元、新殖民主义，还是修正主义背叛，过去和现在都不能阻挡在亚非拉不断兴起的反帝民族解放斗争的浪潮。
    占世界人口绝大多数的亚、非、拉的革命正在沸腾，并成了帝国主义体系内部对抗性矛盾的主要焦点，和世界帝国主义锁链中最薄弱的一环。今天，美帝国主义扮演着国际宪兵的角色，它不得不把兵力分散在世界各地。这是美帝国主义最大的、无法克服的弱点，美帝国主义把它的血腥魔爪伸向各地，这就使它自己置于各国人民的直接打击之下。
    美帝国主义在许多国家发动侵略，例如在阿尔巴尼亚的邻国希腊那样，建立反动的法西斯军事统治，丝毫不表示美帝国主义的强大，而是说明它的虚弱，表示它害怕各国人民的革命斗争。
    在世界资本主义的窠穴——欧洲、北美等地，资本主义体系的内外对抗性矛盾，经济矛盾和阶级矛盾，以及帝国主义列强之间的对抗性矛盾越来越尖锐。
    在这种紧张的国际形势下，以苏联赫鲁晓夫式的领导为中心的现代修正主义者——这些以背叛工人阶级利益谋生的无耻之徒，正面临着叛徒生涯中前所未有的巨大困难，不断遭到失败，并被以自己的行径所制造的深刻矛盾所围困。
    修正主义集团之间的矛盾也在不断加剧，苏联赫鲁晓夫式的领导，越来越失去对其卫星国的控制。修正主义阵线象一件破烂不堪的黑衣，千疮百孔。
    相反，世界各国的马克思列宁主义力量正在壮大。在包括苏联在内的修正主义叛徒集团暂时统治的国家，这种力量也在组织起来，也在进行锻炼、准备和不断加强。
    国际事态的发展表明，世界力量的分化已越来越清楚，各国人民正在日益分清敌人和朋友，他们越来越相信：正如毛泽东同志所指出的，帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派都是纸老虎。
    胜利必然是属于各国人民、革命、社会主义和马克思列宁主义。正如马克思列宁主义所教导的，正如毛泽东所指出的，正如人类的历史发展所证明的，这种胜利必将是出自枪杆子。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，清楚地证明了世界革命运动的蓬勃高涨，证明了社会主义的高涨，证明了马克思列宁主义的发展。中国无产阶级文化大革命打破了帝国主义者和中国的现代修正主义者的希望，它是当前历史时期对修正主义和世界帝国主义最沉重的打击。在国际上，这次革命的锋芒是指向帝国主义的，首先是指向美帝国主义的，是指向现代修正主义的，首先是指向苏联修正主义领导集团的。毫无疑问，中国无产阶级文化大革命将使世界各国被压迫人民的反帝革命运动，国际共产主义运动的发展，国际工人阶级反对资本压迫的斗争，和马克思列宁主义者反对现代修正主义者的斗争，进入新的高潮。
    但是，帝国主义者、修正主义者和反动派不会甘心于他们的失败，不会放下武器，只要还没有进入坟墓，他们就会使用一切手段进行抵抗。
    毛泽东同志说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”千百次的实践证明了毛泽东同志所说的这些话。
    伟大的人民中国站在各国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的前列，今天它已成为帝国主义和修正主义实行独霸世界的计划的不可逾越的长城。美帝国主义者、赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其帮凶，已将其主要力量、并把他们阴谋的主要锋芒指向伟大的人民中国。他们进行狂热的努力，企图在中国周围建立一道“铁的防疫圈”；他们正在把战火烧近中国。约翰逊和柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的会谈，又策划了反对中华人民共和国和中国人民的新阴谋。
    在以美帝国主义和苏联叛徒集团为首的全世界反动派疯狂地反对高举社会主义和革命的大旗的伟大的中国人民，反对无产阶级文化大革命的当前国际形势下，对中华人民共和国的态度就是对无产阶级国际主义、对社会主义和共产主义的态度的试金石。全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命者的崇高的国际主义义务是全力以赴地保卫人民中国，毫无保留地保卫和支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命的总路线，光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的总路线。
    我们完全相信，帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派反对中华人民共和国的一切阴谋诡计都将遭到失败，毛泽东的伟大的人民中国将永远战胜一切敌人。阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，无论是在美好的日子里还是在困难的时刻，将永远是伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党、中国政府、毛泽东同志的忠诚的不可分离的战友。我们将永远战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    同志们，
    越南战争最清楚地暴露了美帝国主义的侵略本性，最清楚地表明，美帝国主义不能打败进行英勇斗争的越南人民；同时最清楚地表明，苏修领导完全背叛了兄弟的越南人民和全世界热爱自由的人民。
    美帝和苏修正在千方百计地企图通过“和谈”迫使英雄的越南人民投降。柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗策划了埋葬越南人民的阴谋。
    我们坚信越南人民把武装斗争坚持到底，毫不妥协，必将胜利。
    中东事件，帝国主义—以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略，暴露了美帝国主义的阴谋家和侵略者的本性，同时也暴露了苏修的背信弃义和叛徒的本性。阿拉伯人民尽管遭到了失败，但是他们没有放弃斗争。如果他们团结反帝，不把希望寄托在苏修身上，不要被帝国主义的老牌代理人约瑟夫·布罗兹·铁托的欺骗，他们能够取得斗争的胜利。
    每天都有苏修领导同美帝企图主宰世界的罪恶勾结的新的事实和新的证据。最近的事实之一，柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗的罪恶交易的主要题目之一，毫无疑问是苏美所谓的“防止核扩散”条约。这个条约是苏修领导在尼·赫鲁晓夫设计的违反各国人民利益的叛徒道路上迈出的新的一大步，其目的是使美苏核垄断合法化。
    但是，美帝和苏修之间的“防止核扩散”条约是注定要失败的，首先是因为中华人民共和国现在已经作为一个原子大国出现在国际舞台上，这就彻底粉碎了美苏核垄断。我国人民、我们党和政府同全世界革命人民一起，热情地欢呼中华人民共和国在核武器和热核武器方面所取得的辉煌成就，并祝愿中华人民共和国的国防力量不断加强，造福于全人类。
    无论是中华人民共和国，还是阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，都遵循着一条真正和平的对外政策。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚不威胁任何国家，也不欺侮任何人，但是许多矛头是针对着矗立在资本主义—帝国主义和修正主义的欧洲、从地理上被包围着的社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，并对她策划了许多阴谋。这些我们知道，并且注视着，我们准备好了顶住一切。如果有一天国外敌人敢于侵犯阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的边界，他们应该知道，他们之中谁进了阿尔巴尼亚，就不能活着出去，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚将成为一切侵略者的坟墓，阿尔巴尼亚的斗争烈火是不受地区限制的，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚在世界上有许多忠诚的伟大的朋友。阿尔巴尼亚人民最伟大、最强大、最忠实的朋友和盟邦是伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志用无产阶级国际主义纯洁感情教育下的伟大中国的七亿人民。社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的敌人永远不要忘记这点。
    同志们！
    全世界的革命者和各国人民即将庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年，它开辟了人类历史的新时代，开辟了没有压迫、没有剥削的新的社会制度胜利的时代，开辟了社会主义和共产主义的时代。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚决粉碎了苏修集团企图抓住它已经扔到泥坑里的伟大的十月社会主义革命的旗帜的迷惑人心的骗人的阴谋。列宁和斯大林的伟大的十月革命的思想和事业的真正继承者，是同修正主义叛徒进行不调和的斗争、保卫和发展十月革命的伟大事业的马列主义党和马列主义力量。
    我们坚信苏联人民、苏联革命的共产党人为推翻并彻底打败赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团，对修正主义叛徒不会忍受很久，将遵循着十月社会主义革命的伟大榜样和中国的无产阶级文化大革命的榜样，进行决定性的斗争，进行革命。他们将继承十月革命的光荣传统，使苏联重新回到马克思列宁主义和共产主义道路上来。
    一切国家的马克思列宁主义者和真正的革命者的任务，是继续加强他们反对以苏联赫鲁晓夫式的领导者为首的现代修正主义的坚决的公开的斗争。要同修正主义者及其组织，特别是同苏联领导集团彻底划清界线，要起来进行一场反对修正主义叛徒的无情的斗争，旨在不让修正主义叛徒达到他们的反革命目的，揭露他们，孤立他们，打倒他们，粉碎他们。
    今天，马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义的分界线象阳光一样的清楚。没有任何事情把真正的马克思列宁主义者同现代修正主义者联合起来，每件事情都使他们分开。如果你幻想修正主义者，能回到马克思列宁主义的道路上来，以为同现代修正主义者可以采取共同行动帮助越南人民，或者认为同现代修正主义者可以站在一条似乎是反帝的共同战线上，这就是说你在同修正主义游戏，滑到了修正主义的立场上去了，给革命和社会主义事业带来不可估量的损失。
    亲爱的同志们，兄弟姊妹们，最后，请允许我再一次向你们表示阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、工人阶级、合作社农民、人民知识分子、人民军和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，对你们伟大的无产阶级文化大革命、对你们反帝反修的光荣斗争，以及社会主义社会的建设的团结和完全的支持，并祝愿你们在无产阶级文化大革命中，在执行毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想方面取得新的辉煌的成就。
    中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民之间、以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    七亿中国人民万岁！
    社会主义和革命的坚不可摧的堡垒，伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党，及其伟大领袖，阿尔巴尼亚人民最尊贵的朋友，毛泽东同志万岁！
    伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利万岁！
    忠于毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的、走在无产阶级文化大革命前列的红色的上海英雄的人民万岁！
    光荣属于马克思列宁主义！
