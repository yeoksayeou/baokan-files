Advance Boldly According to the Latest Instructions of Our Great Leader Chairman Mao

At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, our great leader Chairman Mao has inspected the North China, Central China, and East China regions and given a series of extremely important instructions on the need to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, to further promote revolutionary great alliances, revolutionary three-in-ones, and to establish study classes, among others. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are great historical documents of Marxism-Leninism. They are the most scientific, most complete, most profound, and most thorough summaries of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and more. They are the beacon guiding the entire Party, the entire nation, and the entire army to advance boldly, and are the most powerful ideological weapon to ensure the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Central Military Commission has issued an important notice, calling on all personnel in the entire army, including all cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members, to immediately launch a new high tide of learning and implementing Chairman Mao's latest important instructions. This is the most central political task at present.

To resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions is to achieve victory.

Over the past year and more, at every important juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has always been our great leader Chairman Mao who has most wisely and timely pointed out the direction for our advance and made great strategic deployments. All our achievements and victories have been attained under Chairman Mao's wise leadership and are victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

We must resolutely support, earnestly study, repeatedly propagate, deeply understand, and strictly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, word for word and sentence for sentence, without the slightest deviation.

To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must firmly grasp the line of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and apply it to all thoughts, words, and actions, using it to guide everything, promote everything, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking.

To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must, according to the principle of revolutionary great alliances by system, by industry, and by class, constantly consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances politically, ideologically, and organizationally. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, to the line of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and to the principle of revolutionary great alliances by system, by industry, and by class, we must resolutely support; whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and engages in petty-bourgeois factionalism or cross-industry organizations, we must not support, and must help to correct, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the actions of the broad revolutionary masses.

To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the line, strengthen political and ideological education for military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. We must establish various study classes and help local areas to establish various study classes, turning the entire nation and the entire army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must help the revolutionary masses to correctly handle cadres, help revolutionary cadres to come forward, which is the key to implementing revolutionary three-in-ones, consolidating revolutionary great alliances, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit.

To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must correctly handle the masses, strengthen the mass line, promote democratic style, oppose bad tendencies of putting on airs and acting like officials, treat people equally, go to the masses, consult with the masses on matters, be students of the masses, correctly handle the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses.

To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must further carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, promote revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness, and do all work even better.

Comrades in the entire army! Let us take Chairman Mao's important instructions as our weapon, earnestly summarize the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement and of the "three supports and two militaries" work, combine them with the actual situation of our own regions and units, and formulate practical and feasible specific measures, so that Chairman Mao's important instructions are implemented item by item. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，就要正确对待群众，加强群众观点，发扬民主作风，反对摆架子、做官当老爷的不良倾向，要平等待人，到群众中去，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生，正确处理上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。
    贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，就要进一步开展拥军爱民运动，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，把各项工作做得更好。
