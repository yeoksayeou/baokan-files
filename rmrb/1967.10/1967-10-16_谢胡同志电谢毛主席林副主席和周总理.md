Comrade Muḥammed Shehu's Telegram to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou

New China News Agency, October 15th: Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai today received a telegram of thanks from Muḥammed Shehu, the head of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, who sent it while on his way back home. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
To Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,
Dear Comrades,

At the moment when the Albanian Party and Government Delegation is leaving your glorious country, I feel it is my duty to once again express my sincere gratitude to you, and through you to the heroic Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China, for the extremely warm, very cordial, and fraternal welcome you have given our delegation during our visit to various places in your great and beautiful country. We are leaving your heroic country with the most beautiful impressions and memories. Everything we have seen and learned has filled us with joy. As we return home, we are filled with the boundless love and great friendship of the 700 million Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China for the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and our dear leader Enver Hoxha. We once again sincerely wish that the brotherly Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will achieve new and greater victories in building socialism, in waging a victorious proletarian cultural revolution, and in fighting against imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys—the modern revisionist clique headed by the Soviet traitors, for the great cause of our revolution and socialism.

Muḥammed Shehu
October 15, 1967, On the Plane
