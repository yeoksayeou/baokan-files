In the midst of the masses' surging movement to "Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism," our great leader Chairman Mao has issued another battle command regarding the implementation of revolutionary great alliances by system. This battle command is a major measure to carry out the great policy of "Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism," and is also a part of Chairman Mao's strategic deployment. We, the working class, fully support it and will implement it without the slightest deviation.

The revolutionary mass organizations established in our factory during the Cultural Revolution are cross-system organizations. These organizations played a very good role in mobilizing the masses, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the struggle. However, now that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory and the bourgeois reactionary line has collapsed, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and to deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit, the original cross-industry and cross-department organizations are no longer suitable for the current struggle situation. If we do not timely adjust them by industry, they will become obstacles to the implementation of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Previously, the revolutionary mass organizations in our factory participated in the movements of other units, but they did not understand the situation of other units well and made comments and took over their work. This not only hindered the development of the movements in other units but also seriously affected "grasp the revolution, promote production." In this situation, the comrades of the fourth team in the maintenance workshop of our factory first broke through the organizational boundaries of the two factions and achieved class-wide unity. Subsequently, most of the classes in the factory learned from them and also achieved revolutionary great alliance. On August 17, our factory also established a revolutionary committee. Practice has proven that this is beneficial to overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, beneficial to grasping the revolution and promoting production, and beneficial to promoting the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

We workers must take "Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the guiding principle, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen the transformation of our worldview, and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely criticize the "self" in our minds, expose petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our actions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, focus on the center, deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit, and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

The working class must unite, overcome all difficulties, and firmly, firmly, and again firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously.

　　伟大领袖毛主席新发出的战斗号令是搞好“斗私，批修”的重大措施
　　北京市第一清洁车辆厂革命委员会
    在亿万群众掀起“斗私，批修”的高潮中，伟大领袖毛主席又向我们发出了关于按照系统实行革命大联合的战斗号令。这个战斗号令，是贯彻执行“斗私，批修”伟大方针的重大措施，也是毛主席的战略部署的组成部分。我们工人阶级一千个拥护，一万个照办，绝不打一丝一毫的折扣。
    我们厂在文化大革命运动中间成立的革命群众组织，是跨系统的组织，这在当时发动群众，批判资产阶级反动路线，贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的斗争中，起了很好的作用。但是，现在毛主席的革命路线已经取得了决定性的胜利，资产阶级反动路线已土崩瓦解。为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，深入开展革命大批判和本单位的斗批改，原有的跨行业、跨部门的组织，已经不能适应当前的斗争形势了，如果不及时按行业进行必要的调整，就会成为实现毛主席伟大战略部署的绊脚石。
    以前我们厂的革命群众组织都参加外单位的运动，但对外单位情况并不很了解，却在那里大发议论，包办代替，这样既不利于外单位的运动的开展，同时也严重影响了“抓革命，促生产”。在这种情况下，我厂保养车间总承四组的同志，首先打破两派组织的界限，实现班组大联合。随后，全厂大多数班组向他们学习，也实现了革命大联合。八月十七日，我们厂还建立了革命委员会。实践证明：这样有利于克服小资产阶级的派性，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，有利于抓革命，促生产，有利于促进革命“三结合”的实现。
    我们工人一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，加强世界观的改造，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，搞臭小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级党性，用毛泽东思想来统一我们的行动，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，抓住中心，深入开展革命大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    工人阶级联合起来，排除一切困难，坚定，坚定，再坚定地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进。
