In the midst of the nationwide fervor, as hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians follow the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, swiftly launching a high tide of self-criticism and anti-revisionism, we introduce to you a revolutionary heroic collective united by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

This heroic collective is composed of five different units from the 1124 Construction Site. At a critical moment in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, they fought to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the ironclad socialist mountain stronghold. They engaged in a monumental, twenty-plus-day battle against an unprecedented large-scale collapse. The soldiers, with Mao Zedong Thought as their highest command, united as one, fearing no sacrifice, and used their lives and blood to rescue their class brothers, safeguarding the national defense project. They fully demonstrated the selfless, fearless, and invincible heroic spirit of proletarian revolutionary soldiers.

"The army possesses an indomitable spirit; it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy."

The incident occurred between late March and mid-April at the 1124 Construction Site's central engineering section, specifically in the fifth area.

The fifth area had very loose rock formations and a large layer of soil, with a wide span and a broad working surface in mid-air. It was already a difficult and dangerous area to work in. Just as the area was being expanded, a heavy rainstorm hit, causing water to seep into the soil layer and the weathered rocks to continuously fall. To ensure the safety of the workers, the site leadership had taken various measures to mitigate the risks. However, the risks continued to appear, growing more severe, and there were signs that a major collapse was imminent.

The fifth area became known as the "tiger's mouth" on the site and the focal point of the entire site.

Two choices lay before the construction troops: either avoid the "tiger's mouth," halt all operations in the fifth area until the collapse stabilized, and then resume work. This would delay the overall project, severely affect the quality of the work, and cause significant losses to the country and the people. Or, they could press on despite the danger, racing against time to complete the fifth area before the impending major collapse. Chairman Mao taught us: "The army possesses an indomitable spirit; it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy." The comrades, clutching their red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," were determined to enter the tiger's den, seal the tiger's mouth, and fight a tough battle!

Determination letters and guarantees poured in from various regiments and companies, like snowflakes, to the site's party committee. The soldiers declared, "Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will fight!" They vowed to test their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao in this battle and to forge a red heart for the public in this struggle.

At this critical moment, the construction troops' party committee decided: on one hand, to urgently reinforce and strengthen safety measures to minimize the danger; on the other hand, to urgently proceed with operations, racing against time to complete the "tiger's mouth" before the major collapse. This arduous task was entrusted to the engineering company of a certain unit, which had just been transferred to the site.

The company was in the midst of a two-line struggle education campaign centered on "Praising the great achievements of Chairman Mao and criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev," deeply studying and applying the "Three Articles," and transforming their worldview by breaking private interests and establishing public interests. With boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, they arrived at the site. The entire company vowed with iron will: "We will face the danger head-on, tread over difficulties, and resolutely conquer the 'tiger's mouth'!"

On March 27, the battle began! The next evening, as the third shift went to work, Platoon Leader Chen Yifu, as usual, led everyone in reciting "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and singing songs from Chairman Mao's quotations, marching bravely and proudly to the "tiger's mouth." Platoon Leader Chen once again rallied the troops before the battle. Young Communist League member Gu Lianxin felt that this moment was extraordinary and spontaneously took out his notebook to record the moving scene of that evening's battle: "The night is late, before work, we read quotations, discuss the battle, and make up our minds not to fear difficulties; the work is hard, there are dangers, revolutionary soldiers have heroic courage, facing life and death without flinching!" Everyone rushed towards the most dangerous northern working surface.

Leading the charge were Class Six soldier Liu Guolu and Class Leader Fan Qin.

Liu Guolu, a farmer's son who had recently joined the party, had long decided: "I will treat the construction site as a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and as a battlefield for breaking private interests and establishing public interests." He also wrote in his diary: "'Public' is the bravest, 'private' is the most cowardly. If your mind is filled with 'private,' you will fear even a falling speck of dust; if your mind is filled with 'public,' you will dare to face even a collapsing mountain." At this moment, his heart surged with emotion, and he was determined to fulfill his vow with actual actions.

On the high bridge, someone was transporting materials, while on the ground, someone was using a winch to transport debris. Small stones kept falling, hitting the protective shed with a cracking sound. The soldiers repeatedly recited: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Everyone worked quickly and calmly.

Time ticked away second by second. Suddenly, the stones hitting the protective shed increased. Soldier Qi Guangzhao from Class Seven, who was transporting materials despite being ill, heard the continuous alarm signals from above. He looked up and saw Liu Guolu and Fan Qin, exposed outside the protective shed, working tirelessly without even lifting their heads. This scene moved him deeply. He thought: No matter how hard or dangerous it is, Communist Party members fear nothing. I must learn from them.

"All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other."

Around nine o'clock in the evening, an unprecedented, continuous large-scale collapse suddenly occurred.

The "tiger's mouth" roared, and in an instant, dozens of cubic meters of stones, accompanied by a thunderous roar, cascaded down. The power went out, the lights went off, the high-altitude transport bridge collapsed, thick steel pipes were bent, and hard steel rails were twisted. The protective shed and the working platform were completely flattened. The narrow fifth area was filled with collapsed stones and fallen timber.

The eight comrades working on the high-altitude platform, including Liu Guolu, were all thrown down, and Deputy Squad Leader Huang Xiulong from the ninth company, who was pushing a cart to transport debris on the ground, was also buried underneath. The lives of these nine class brothers were in grave danger.

"We are all from the four corners of the country, united by a common revolutionary goal... All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." The great teachings of our red sun, Chairman Mao, shone brightly in everyone's mind. This was the highest command, the greatest power.

Rescue teams from all directions rushed to the scene in waves, and the site was filled with people from different companies. A sea of white safety helmets surged forward, wave after wave. Under the helmets, countless red hearts aimed at one goal: quickly rescue the class brothers from the tiger's mouth! Quickly rescue the project! Under the helmets, countless red hearts made one vow: No matter how large the collapse, we will charge ahead! No matter how the earth shatters, we will press on!

The "tiger's mouth" was the battlefield, time was life, and Mao Zedong Thought was the highest command.

The first to charge into the danger zone were nine comrades from three companies on the night shift: Platoon Leader Zhao Haicheng, soldiers Yu Yueling, Feng Jianyou, Wang Guang'an, Wang Jiqing, Zhang Yichang, Sun Yongran, Wang Xiwen, and Li Liangshu. In the darkness, stones were falling everywhere, and nothing could be seen. They loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "The army possesses an indomitable spirit; it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy..." The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated every heart, making it bright and shining, and illuminated the entire site, making it red and glowing.

In just four minutes, the "tiger's mouth" experienced three consecutive large collapses. The nine heroes, relying on the radiant Mao Zedong Thought, rescued four comrades in one breath.

To rescue the remaining five comrades more quickly, the leadership assigned the rescue task to the ninth company, which had the most people. Immediately, everyone shouted:

"I am from the ninth company!"

"So am I!"

"We are all from the ninth company!"

Several companies, hundreds of people, all claimed to be from the ninth company. No one was willing to retreat, and no one wanted to leave the battlefield.

The old regiment commander Luo Yi and Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Zhu, who were actively directing the battle on the front lines of the site, looked at the crowded scene and couldn't help but recall the unforgettable scenes from the past when the army demanded to be the spearhead to break through the enemy's defenses. Their hearts were filled with excitement: This is the fruit of studying Chairman Mao's works under the direct leadership of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, emphasizing proletarian politics! In the face of this heroic collective united by Mao Zedong Thought, who in the world can match them!

The ninth company, except for one sentry and two seriously ill soldiers, had all its soldiers rush to the scene from various positions and different directions. This was a heroic company that fought bravely in battle, defended tenaciously, and had achieved many victories. It was a four-good company with significant achievements in revolutionary construction.

The ninth company immediately joined the rescue battle and quickly discovered Fan Qin, who was buried under stones and timber. Immediately, Deputy Squad Leader Chen Dawen from Class Five, Squad Leader Song Wentian from Class Six, drill operator Shi Jingwu, and soldier Xing Guangtian from the seventh company, who had mingled with the ninth company's assault team, voluntarily formed a rescue team. Squad Leader Zhang Lianqi from the fourth squad of the ninth company took charge of the danger zone. Shi Jingwu's heart burned with urgency, and he frantically dug out the stones and timber pressing on Fan Qin's head, his heavy waterproof suit soaked with sweat. A falling stone knocked him over, and he was rescued by his comrades.

The collapse continued, and another soldier from the seventh company, Liu Ruiting, who had mingled with the assault team, noticed that Fan Qin did not have a safety helmet. Without hesitation, he took off his own and put it on Fan Qin. Immediately, an officer took off his safety helmet and put it on Liu Ruiting. Then, many more people offered their safety helmets...

Standing in the danger zone directing the ninth company's rescue, Battalion Commander Xing Zhenhai of the third battalion saw all this and felt a deep sense of class solidarity welling up in his heart. He excitedly shouted, "Bring the big wooden beams!" He and Zhang Lianqi decided to build a shelter here to protect the comrades—a "big safety helmet."

At this moment, almost all the danger observers were issuing emergency signals, reporting that stones in multiple locations were about to fall. However, the assault team members immediately formed three echelons, each carrying a thick round log, and rushed forward in response. They recited in unison: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." The resounding voice of Chairman Mao's quotations shook the "tiger's mouth" and inspired everyone. Quickly, a shelter was built.

While rescuing Fan Qin, the other companies' soldiers who had been waiting inside and outside the site were also engaged in intense battles:

Without lights, the old battalion commander Liu Wencai climbed to the high danger zone, stood on the half-hanging timber, and held the just-connected spotlight, sending a bright light to the rescuers.

To ensure the continuous observation and reporting of danger, many comrades climbed to high places along the suspended ropes, staring intently at the changing stones for hours on end.

These extremely responsible officers and soldiers were silently contributing their efforts to the rescue battle.

The rescue of Fan Qin continued to be intense.

Xing Guangtian held Fan Qin's head in his arms, while his own head and back were exposed outside the shelter. At this moment, Fan Qin regained consciousness slightly, and Xing Guangtian happily told him, "Many leaders and comrades have come!" Fan Qin was deeply moved and nodded. After a while, Fan Qin struggled to ask, "Which province are you from?" Xing Guangtian said, "I am from Heilongjiang." Fan Qin said, "I am from Hebei." "We are all from the four corners of the country, united by a common revolutionary goal." Instantly, a great warmth connected the rescuers and the injured comrade, radiating a deep class sentiment of sharing life and death. Father and mother are dear, but those united by Mao Zedong Thought are the dearest! The river is deep, the sea is deep, but the sentiment of proletarian revolutionary soldiers is the deepest!

Suddenly, a falling stone hit Xing Guangtian's safety helmet. Xing Guangtian did not move, but held Fan Qin's head even tighter. He looked up at the top of the danger zone, where stones continued to fall. He gritted his teeth and vowed, "Hit me, hit me! Even if the sky falls, I will hold it up!"

The danger grew, and another collapse occurred. A block of stone hit the shelter, breaking it and leaving a gap wide enough for a person. At this moment, Communist Party member Chen Dawen remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Concern for the party and the masses is more important than concern for oneself, and concern for others is more important than concern for oneself." Instantly, he was filled with the strength to overcome all difficulties and dangers. He stood up abruptly, his legs spread wide, his hands firmly supporting the stone wall, using his tall and sturdy body to block the gap in the shelter. Song Wentian shouted repeatedly, "Five, it's dangerous, get out of the way!" Chen Dawen said, "Six, don't worry about me!" A shower of falling stones hit the shelter and Chen Dawen's shoulders and back. He loudly recited, "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." He supported the stones even more firmly, stood even more steadily, like a rock, unmoving. Truly: It is easy to shake a mountain, but difficult to shake a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

Communist Party member Song Wentian, who had been squatting there, frantically digging out stones to rescue Fan Qin, looked up at Chen Dawen using his body to protect him, and looked down at Xing Guangtian holding Fan Qin's head in his arms. He was deeply moved, his face streaming with sweat and tears, and he sped up the rescue. He wished he had more hands, he wished he could use his head to break the wood, he wished he could use his teeth to open the stone cracks... At first, he used a shovel to dig, fearing he might injure Fan Qin, so he threw away the shovel and dug with his hands. His hands were cut open, but he felt no pain. He thought: As long as the comrade suffers less pain, I am willing to suffer ten times the pain.

It took two hours to rescue Fan Qin.

Immediately, the comrades from the seventh and eighth companies also bravely rescued their class brothers in another danger zone.

This battle to rescue the lives of class brothers lasted for more than twenty hours, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought every moment, radiating the glory of revolutionary collective heroism every moment, and powerfully criticizing the "survival philosophy" of the Chinese Khrushchev every moment.

"With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

In this battle against the continuous large-scale collapse, Communist Party member Liu Guolu, Young Communist League members Huang Xiulong, Xu Dejun, and Zhao Zhijie, four comrades, heroically sacrificed their precious lives.

In the pocket stained with the blood of martyr Liu Guolu, comrades found a note he had written in the "Dare to struggle, dare to win" section of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao": "Only the sacrifice of a few can bring happiness to the many."

The shining eighteen characters expressed the common voice of the martyrs, living for the people and dying for the people. The shining eighteen characters became the boundless power for comrades to continue the struggle.

The site was filled with praises for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. The battle assessment meeting became a meeting to praise the great leader Chairman Mao, and the heroism report meeting became a meeting to share the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The army launched a wave of "Praise the leader, learn from the heroes, criticize 'Self-Cultivation'" The praises were for: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the highest command, the learning was of: The heroes' boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and the criticism was of: The Chinese Khrushchev who betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat. All the soldiers vowed, "Fight again in the fifth area, resolutely subdue the 'tiger's mouth'!"

At this time, the "tiger's mouth" experienced forty-three collapses and falling stones every eight hours. Such a large-scale collapse was unprecedented. Under such a great danger, to subdue the "tiger's mouth," it was necessary to rebuild the bridge, reconnect the north-south transportation routes, and then strongly support and lock the "tiger's mouth." Such a strong support was also unprecedented.

But the soldiers of another brigade's engineering company, who took on this arduous task, unanimously declared: We are a bridge-building company. In battle, we were the vanguard in building bridges and crossing rivers under enemy fire. Today, we will be the vanguard in strongly supporting under the falling stones.

The party branch organized the entire company to deeply study and apply the "Three Articles," mobilizing the masses to grasp and transform their living thoughts, turning the "Three Articles" into their souls and weapons for battle. Company Commander Gao Guicheng entered the "tiger's mouth" eight times and sent danger observers to observe day and night, recording danger data. After research and analysis, they finally understood the distribution of the collapse and mastered the changing patterns of the danger. They combined the leadership, engineering technicians, and operational teams to formulate a battle plan to subdue the "tiger's mouth."

The battle to fight again in the fifth area began at the "tiger's mouth." The soldiers carried one after another seventeen-meter-long, one-thousand-seven-hundred-kilogram steel beams into the fifth area. With no vehicles to transport them, they carried them on their shoulders. With no machinery, they moved them by hand. Everyone carried the heavy steel beams, loudly reciting: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." To quickly build the bridge, a large amount of timber was needed. Squad Leader Sun Yongran led more than ten comrades to transport timber on the bridge. When passing through the third area, the high bridge was damaged by blasting and only two steel pipes remained, one high and one low, suspended in mid-air. How could they pass? Everyone loudly recited: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous battle (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Sun Yongran said to everyone, "Comrades, rescuing the national defense project is defending the proletarian dictatorship. Time is victory. Charge forward!" The comrades, in pairs, carried the thick round logs, stepping on the single steel pipe and advancing. They bent the steel pipe into an arch shape, and with every step forward, the steel pipe trembled, at any moment it could fall. Later, they said, "We fought a battle of breaking private interests and establishing public interests here!" Thus, they fought for three days and three nights in the "tiger's mouth" under the falling stones, rebuilding a bridge spanning the north-south transportation route, ensuring smooth transportation, and winning the first victory in subduing the "tiger's mouth."

"Pursue the fleeing enemy while your courage remains." After capturing the bridge, the second company continued to advance to the center of the danger zone, launching a powerful strong support to shock the "tiger's mouth."

As soon as the battle began, Company Commander Gao Guicheng did not leave the site for twenty-six consecutive hours. He commanded in the first line at every support level. Entering the danger zone, he led the way, and exiting the danger zone, he brought up the rear. Once, they had just pulled a horizontal beam onto the working platform when suddenly the lights flashed twice, and the signal to fire the cannon was issued. To gain time to secure the horizontal beam and avoid it falling due to the blast, he dispatched someone to delay the firing time and hurriedly installed the horizontal beam. Just as they secured the horizontal beam, the firing signal was issued. At this time, the workers could no longer retreat along the originally planned route. Commander Gao quickly and decisively changed the retreat route to the bridge. He stood there, counting the soldiers running out one by one, until the last one. He was about to retreat when he suddenly had a thought: Were there any people who had temporarily entered without knowing about the firing? He ran to the working surface to check again before quickly retreating. He had just left the danger zone when he heard a series of thunderous explosions, dozens of cannons firing.

This example of leadership strongly inspired every soldier. The comrades said, "Thinking of Chairman Mao's words and having Commander Gao by our side, our hearts are at ease, no matter how great the danger."

Once, during high-altitude operations, Class Seven soldier He Guishan was securing a horizontal support beam when suddenly the observer above him issued an alarm for falling stones. He Guishan looked down and saw many comrades working below. If he let go and dodged, he could escape, but the unsecured giant horizontal beam would fall and injure the comrades below. The words "selflessly serving others" flashed before He Guishan's eyes. He stood firmly, securing the horizontal beam, risking his life to ensure the safety of his comrades.

The entire company, in the battle to subdue the "tiger's mouth," recited Chairman Mao's quotations day and night and sang songs from Chairman Mao's quotations day and night. They read quotations before work, accepting Chairman Mao's commands; they recited quotations during work, following Chairman Mao's instructions; they reviewed quotations after work, accepting Chairman Mao's inspections. Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, they captured the bridge in three days and locked the "tiger's mouth" in six days, achieving a crucial victory.

After three days and nights of hard work, the "tiger's mouth" was completely subdued, and the project's evil was eliminated. A great copper wall and iron wall appeared, and the entire project leaped forward. The song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed through the site!

The victory of the 1124 Construction Site troops over the large-scale collapse is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The five companies fighting at the 1124 Construction Site are a heroic collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought, selfless, fearless, and invincible.

In the face of this heroic collective united by Mao Zedong Thought, no enemy, no difficulty, can make us afraid or shake us.

Let us raise higher and higher the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the highest commander Chairman Mao, and bravely advance along the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao! With tens of millions of heroic soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tens of millions of heroic collectives united by Mao Zedong Thought, we are invincible, and we can create all miracles on earth.

    毛泽东思想统一起来的英雄集体
    记1124工地部队抢险斗争的光辉事迹
    在全国亿万军民遵循伟大领袖毛主席最新指示，迅速掀起斗私批修的高潮中，我们向大家介绍一个用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统一起来的革命英雄集体。
    这个英雄集体是1124工地不同建制的五个英雄连队。他们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战时刻，为了保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫社会主义铁打的江山，和一场罕见的大塌方，展开了持续二十多天的惊天动地的大搏斗。指战员们以伟大的毛泽东思想作最高指挥，团结一心，不怕牺牲，用生命和鲜血救出了阶级兄弟，保卫了国防工程，充分表现了无产阶级革命战士无私、无畏、无敌的英雄气概。
      “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决
  不被敌人所屈服。”
    事情发生在三月下旬到四月中旬，地点在1124工地工程中心的五号地段。
    五号地段石质很松，又有一个很大的土夹层，加上它的跨度大，凌空作业面宽，本来就是一个难“啃”的险区。这个地段刚刚扩挖出来，又赶上一场大雨，雨水渗入土夹层，风化石不断剥离下落。为了保证作业人员的安全，工地领导曾采取了各种方法排险，但是险情仍然不断出现，威胁越来越大，有迹象表明：可能出现一次较大的塌方。
    五号地段成了工地上有名的“老虎口”，也成了全工地注视的中心。
    摆在施工部队面前有两种选择：要么避开“老虎口”，停止五号地段的一切作业，等它塌够，稳定后再干；这样，就要延缓整个工程的进展，严重影响工程的质量，给国家和人民造成重大损失。要么顶着危险，争分夺秒，在可能出现的大塌方之前，拿下五号地段。毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”同志们捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一心想着毛主席的最高指示，发誓要入虎穴，封虎口，打一场硬仗！
    各营各连的决心书、保证书，象雪片一样，飞到工地党委。指战员们表示，毛主席指到那里，我们就打到那里！要在这场战斗中考验自己对伟大领袖毛主席的忠诚，要在这场战斗中炼出一颗为公的红心。
    在这关键时刻，施工部队党委决定：一面突击支撑，加强防险保安，把危险减到最低限度；一面突击作业，抢在大塌方之前，拿下“老虎口”。这个艰巨的突击任务，交给了刚调来工地的某部队工兵二连。
    二连正在进行以“颂扬伟大领袖毛主席丰功伟绩，批判中国赫鲁晓夫滔天罪行”为中心的两条路线斗争教育，大学狠用“老三篇”，破私立公改造世界观。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨的心情来到工地。全连同志发出钢铁般的誓言：顶着险情上，踩着困难走，到虎口拔牙，坚决拿下“老虎口”！
    三月二十七日，战斗打响了！第二天晚上，第三作业班上工的时候，排长陈益福和往常一样，首先和大家一同背诵《为人民服务》，高唱毛主席语录歌，雄赳赳，气昂昂，来到“老虎口”。排长再一次向大家作战前动员。共青团员顾连新感到这个时刻很不平常，情不自禁地掏出笔记本，记下了当晚这场战斗前的动人情景：“天已晚，上工前，读语录，谈奋战，下定决心不怕难；工作苦，有危险，革命战士英雄胆，面对生死气不喘！”只见大家争先恐后朝着险情最大的北部作业面跑去了。
    跑在最前面的是六班战士刘国吕和班长樊勤。
    不久前光荣入党的雇农的儿子刘国吕，早就下定决心：“要把工地当成活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，破私立公的战场。”他还在日记中写道：“‘公’字最勇敢，‘私’字最怕死。脑子里有了‘私’字，灰尘落下都害怕；脑子里有了‘公’字，山崩地裂都敢上。”这时，他心潮澎湃，坚决要用实际行动来实现自己的誓言。
    高高的天桥上有人在运料，地面上有人在飞车运碴，上面的小石头不停地落下来，打得防护棚上叭叭响。战士们一遍又一遍朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”大家迅速、镇定地工作着。
    时间一秒一秒地过去，突然，打在防护棚上的石头多了起来。带病坚持运料的七班战士齐广照，听见上面报险哨音一声连着一声，他抬头望去，只见暴露在防护棚外面的刘国吕、樊勤，正在一个劲地干着，连头也不抬。此情此景，使他万分激动。他想：再艰苦，再危险，共产党员无所畏惧。我一定向他们学习。
        “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    晚间九点多钟，一场罕见的连续不断的特大塌方突然发生。
      “老虎口”咆哮起来了，霎时间，几十立方石头伴着轰然巨响倾泻下来。电线断了，电灯灭了。高空运输的天桥砸塌了，粗大的钢管砸断了，坚硬的钢轨砸弯了；防护棚和作业架全部砸倒了。五号狭长的地段上，堆满了塌方的石头和倒塌的木料。
    高处作业架上的刘国吕等八位同志全部摔了下来，地面上推车运碴的九连副班长黄秀龙也被压在下面。这九位阶级兄弟的生命处于万分危急之中。
      “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的伟大教导，在每个人的头脑里闪闪发光。这是最高的命令，最大的力量。
    参加抢险的人群从四面八方一批一批迅速赶到，工地内外挤满了不同连队的人。一片白花花的防险帽，象潮水一般，一浪高一浪，浪浪向前涌。防险帽下，多少颗红心朝着一个目标：快把阶级弟兄从虎口里救出来！快快抢救工事！防险帽下，多少颗红心一个誓言：塌方再大也要冲，天崩地裂也要上！
    “老虎口”就是战场，时间就是生命，毛泽东思想是最高指挥。
    最先冲进险区的是三个连队夜班作业的九个同志：排长赵海清、战士于月明、冯建友、王国安、王继青、张一昌、孙永然、王秀文、李良书。黑暗中，到处都在掉石头，什么也看不见，他们高声朗诵毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。……”光焰无际的毛泽东思想，把每个人的心照得崭亮崭亮，把整个工地照得通红通红。
    短短四分钟内，“老虎口”连续三次大塌方，九勇士靠着光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，一口气救出了四位战友。
    为了更快地救出另外五位遇难战友，领导上把抢救突击任务交给了来人最多的九连。立刻，人们都在大声喊道：
    “我是九连的！”
    “我也是九连的！”
    “我们都是九连的！”
    好几个连队几百号人都说自己是九连的，谁也不肯后撤一步，谁也不愿离开这个战场。
    活跃在工地前线亲自指挥战斗的老团长罗仪和副政委张澍，望着这一片拥挤的人群，禁不住想起当年部队要求当尖刀攻突破口的难忘情景，心里万分激动：这是在林彪副主席直接领导下，大学毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治的硕果啊！在毛泽东思想统一起来的英雄集体面前，试看天下谁能敌！
    九连，除一名哨兵和两名重病号外，全连指战员从各个岗位、从不同方向都赶来了。这是一个在战场上攻得勇猛、守得顽强、屡建战功的英雄连队，是一个革命化建设取得很大成绩的四好连队。
    九连立即投入了抢险战斗，很快发现了被石碴、木料埋着的樊勤。马上，五班副班长陈大文、六班长宋文田、钻岩机手施景武和“混”在九连突击队里的七连战士邢广田，自动组成抢救小组；九连四排长张连启主动担任险区指挥。施景武心如火灼，拚着全力猛扒压住樊勤头部的石碴和木头，笨重的水衣套着他，大汗如雨淋。一块险石掉下来把他打翻个筋斗，被同志们救了出去。
    塌方在继续，又一个“混”在突击队里的七连保管员刘瑞庭，发现樊勤头上没有防险帽，就毫不犹豫地摘下自己的给樊勤戴上。马上，一个干部把自己的防险帽戴在刘瑞庭头上。接着，又有许多人把自己的防险帽递过来……
    站在险区指挥九连抢救的三营营长邢振海，看到这一切，深厚的阶级感情从心上涌起。他激动地大喊一声：“扛大木头来！”他和张连启决心在这里指挥九连搭起一个掩护同志们的“大防险帽”——偏厦。
    此刻，几乎所有险情观察员都在发出告急哨音，预报多处险石就要下落。但是，突击队员们立即组成了三个梯队，每人抱着一根粗大圆木，应声而上。他们齐声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”激昂响亮的毛主席语录声，震撼着“老虎口”，激励着每个人。很快，一个偏厦搭起来了。
    就在抢救樊勤的同时，始终守候在工地内外的其他几个连队的指战员们，也在进行着紧张的战斗：
    没有灯光，抗日战争时期参军的老营长刘文才爬上险区高处，站在半悬空的木头上，抱着刚接上电源的聚光灯，把巨大的光亮送给了抢救人员。
    为了不中断观察和报告险情，好多同志顺着悬挂的绳索爬到高处，一连几个小时目不转睛地盯着险石的变化。
    这些极端负责的干部战士，都在不声不响地为着抢险战斗贡献着自己的一份力量。
    抢救樊勤的战斗在继续紧张进行。
    邢广田把樊勤的头抱在怀里，而自己的头和背却暴露在偏厦外面。这时，樊勤稍微苏醒过来，邢广田高兴地告诉他说：“好多首长和同志都来了！”樊勤非常感动地点着头。隔了一会，樊勤吃力地问道：“你是那个省的？”邢广田说：“我是黑龙江的。”樊勤说：“我是河北的。”“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”顿时，一股巨大的暖流把抢救人员和负伤的同志紧紧连结在一起，焕发出生死与共的阶级深情。爹亲娘亲，用毛泽东思想统一起来的人最亲！河深海深，无产阶级革命战士的感情最深！
    突然，一块险石掉下来，正好打在邢广田的防险帽上。邢广田纹丝不动，却把樊勤的头抱得更紧。他抬头望着险区顶端的险石，碎石还在不断下落，他咬牙发誓地说：“你砸，砸吧！天塌下来我也要顶住！”
    险情越来越大，又一次塌方下来了。一块块重石砸在偏厦上，偏厦被砸裂，出现了一人宽的空档。这时，共产党员陈大文，想起了毛主席的教导：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。”顿时浑身充满了要压倒一切困难和危险的力量。他猛地站了起来，双腿叉开，两手紧支石壁，用他那高大魁梧的身躯堵住了偏厦的空档。宋文田连连喊道：“五班副，危险，闪开！”陈大文说：“六班长，不用管我！”一阵碎石掉下来，打在偏厦上叭叭响，也打在陈大文肩背上，只听他高声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”看他两手支得更紧，双腿站得更稳，坚如磐石，岿然不动。真是：撼山易，撼毛泽东思想武装起来的战士难！
    一直蹲在那里用双手猛扒碎石，抢救樊勤的共产党员宋文田，抬头看看陈大文用身体掩护着自己，低头看看邢广田把樊勤的头抱在怀里，他感动万分，脸上流着汗水，也流着泪水，更加加快了抢救的速度。他恨不得多长几双手，他恨不得用头顶断木头，他恨不得用牙咬开石缝……。开始，他用锹扒，怕碰伤了樊勤，就丢掉锹，用手扒，双手划出了多少血口，他全然感觉不到。他想：只要战友减少一分痛苦，我自己痛苦十分也心甘情愿。
    整整用了两个小时，终于把樊勤抢救了出来。
    紧接着，七连和八连的同志们，也在另一处险区奋勇抢救遇难的阶级兄弟。
    这场抢救阶级兄弟生命的战斗，连续进行了二十多个小时，每时每刻都在闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉，每时每刻都焕发出革命的集体英雄主义的光彩，每时每刻都是对中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”的有力批判。
        “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    在这场和持续大塌方的搏斗中，共产党员刘国吕、共青团员黄秀龙、徐德君、赵志杰四位战友，光荣地献出了自己的宝贵生命。
    在烈士刘国吕鲜血染红的口袋里，同志们发现他在《毛主席语录》“敢于斗争，敢于胜利”这一节里，夹着一张字条，上面端端正正地写着：
    “只有少数人的牺牲，才能换来多数人的幸福。”
    闪闪发光的十八个大字，表达了烈士们生为人民、死为人民的共同心声。闪闪发光的十八个大字，变成了同志们继续战斗的无穷力量。
    工地上，到处都在歌颂光焰无际的毛泽东思想。战评会变成了歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的颂扬会，英雄事迹报告会变成了活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会。部队里掀起了“颂领袖、学英雄、批《修养》”的热潮。颂扬的是：战无不胜的毛泽东思想是最高指挥，学习的是：英雄无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，批判的是：背叛无产阶级专政的中国赫鲁晓夫。全体指战员发出了“再战五号地段，坚决制伏‘老虎口’”的钢铁誓言。
    这个时候的“老虎口”，每八小时塌方落石多达四十三次，这样的大塌方，他们未曾见过。在这种巨大的险情下，要制伏“老虎口”，必须重新架设天桥，沟通南北运输的通路，然后强行大支撑，锁住“老虎口”。这样的大支撑，他们也未曾见过。
    但抢到这项艰巨任务的另一个师的工兵二连干部战士一致表示：我们是舟桥连，战斗中我们在敌人炮火下架桥渡河当先锋，今天我们要在塌方石雨下强行支撑当先锋。
    党支部组织全连同志大学大用“老三篇”，发动群众大抓狠抓活思想，把“老三篇”化为自己的灵魂，作为战斗的武器。连长高桂成八入“老虎口”，并派出险情观察员昼夜观察，记录险情资料，经过研究分析，终于摸清了塌方分布情况，掌握了险情变化规律，由领导、工程技术人员和作业分队三结合，制定了制伏“老虎口”的战斗计划。
    再战五号地段的战斗在“老虎口”打响了。战士们把一根根十七米长、一千七百斤重的钢梁，运进五号地段。没有车运，用肩抬，没有机械，用手搬。大家抬着沉重的钢梁，高声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”抢架天桥，急需大量木料。六班长孙永然带着十几个同志在天桥上运木料，路经三号地段时，高高的天桥在放炮时被震坏了，只剩下两根钢管，一高一低悬架在空中，怎么过得去？大家高声朗诵：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”孙永然向大家说：“同志们，抢救国防工程就是保卫无产阶级政权，时间就是胜利，冲过去！”同志们每两人一对扛着粗大圆木，踩着单根钢管前进。他们把钢管都压成了弓形，每前进一步，钢管都颤动一下，随时会有掉下去的危险。事后，他们说：“我们在这里打了一场破私立公的战斗！”就这样，他们在落石如雨的“老虎口”里，奋战三天三夜，重新架设起一道横跨南北通路的天桥，保证了运输的畅通，赢得了制伏“老虎口”的首战胜利。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇”。二连在夺下天桥之后，又乘胜去险区中心展开了威震“老虎口”的强行大支撑。
    战斗一打响，连长高桂成连续二十六个小时没有离开工地。支撑高达八层，层层他都在第一线指挥。进险区他走在最前头，出险区他走在最后头。一次，他们刚把一根横梁拉上作业架，忽然电灯闪了两下，点炮预报的信号发出了。为了争取时间把横梁钉好，避免放炮的时候被震落，他就一面派人联系推迟放炮时间，一面加紧安装横梁。谁知刚把横梁钉上，点炮信号就发出了。这时作业人员按原来确定的路线撤出已经来不及，高连长机智果断地改为由天桥迅速撤出。只见他站在那里，一个一个数着跑步撤出的战士，直数到最后一个。他正准备跟着撤出来，脑子里忽然闪过一个念头：还有没有临时进去不知道要放炮的人？便又跑到作业面检查了一遍，才迅速撤出。他刚出险区，只听得轰隆隆连声巨响，数十炮爆炸了。
    这种榜样的力量，强烈地感染着每一个战士。同志们说：“想着毛主席的话，又有连长在我们身边，心里就踏实，险情再大也不觉得啥。”一次，高空作业的七班战士贺桂山，正在钉一根支撑横梁，突然，观察员在他头顶发出险石下落的哨音。贺桂山向下一看，下面有不少同志正在作业，如果松手闪开，自己虽然可以脱险，但未钉好的巨大横梁掉下去，就会砸伤下边的同志。“毫不利己专门利人”八个大字在贺桂山眼前闪现，他屹立不动，坚持把横梁钉好，冒着生命危险，换来了战友的安全。
    全连同志在制伏“老虎口”的战斗中，日夜朗读毛主席语录，日夜高唱毛主席语录歌。他们在连续九昼夜的奋战中，上工前学语录，接受毛主席的命令；施工中背语录，听从毛主席的指挥；下工后对照语录，接受毛主席的检查。他们靠毛泽东思想，三天夺下天桥，六天锁住“虎口”，立下了关键的一功。
    经过三昼夜苦战，彻底制伏了“老虎口”，铲除了工程的恶患。一道巨大的铜墙铁壁展现开来，整个工程在飞跃进展，工地上《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声响彻云霄！
    1124工地部队战胜大塌方的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    战斗在1124工地的五个连队，是毛泽东思想武装的无私、无畏、无敌的英雄集体。
    在用毛泽东思想统一起来的英雄集体面前，不论任何敌人，任何困难，我们都不怕，都动摇不了我们。
    让我们更高更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟最高统帅毛主席，沿着毛主席指引的革命航向奋勇前进！有了亿万个用毛泽东思想武装的英雄战士，有了亿万个用毛泽东思想统一起来的英雄集体，我们就无往而不胜，我们就能创造出一切人间奇迹。
