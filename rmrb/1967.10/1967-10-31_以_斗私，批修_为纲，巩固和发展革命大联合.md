The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has been triumphantly carried out for more than a year. Over the past year, our factory's revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have bravely fought against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev. This is a process of "criticizing revisionism." It is also a process of using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply examine our souls and continuously transform our subjective world. This is a process of "fighting selfishness."

Through more than a year of struggle, we have deeply felt that: revolutionary rebellion relies on Mao Zedong Thought, seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and achieving revolutionary unity also relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The realization, consolidation, and development of revolutionary unity in our factory are precisely the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

Before our factory achieved revolutionary unity, there were ten revolutionary mass organizations. They were basically divided into two factions represented by the "Work-Study Command Department" (abbreviated as "Work-Study") and the "August 1st Squad" (abbreviated as "August 1st"). "Work-Study" seized power from the power-holders within the factory who were taking the capitalist road. After seizing power, some leaders of "Work-Study" developed various unhealthy emotions to different degrees, always feeling that "we are the most revolutionary." Therefore, in organizational development, they always hoped that their fighting team would be "pure and pure," with a serious tendency towards sectarianism. This sectarianism hindered the development and growth of the revolutionary forces. Some revolutionary masses, under such circumstances, joined "August 1st." Thus, "Work-Study" regarded "August 1st" as a "mixed bag." This sectarianism was linked with factionalism. They looked down on the smaller organizations that emerged later. Coincidentally, "Work-Study" and "August 1st" had a dispute over the power seizure in a workshop and became opposed to each other. "August 1st" seized on the fact that "Work-Study"'s fighting team had written a wrong quote from Chairman Mao, creating public opinion. Some comrades from "Work-Study," in a fit of anger, launched a public opinion offensive against "August 1st" three times in a row with large banners, intending to label "August 1st" as a conservative organization.

"August 1st" also started from small-groupism, seizing on the shortcomings of "Work-Study" and looking for opportunities to write "notices" and issue protests. "Work-Study" had once excluded a comrade who had joined the Revolutionary Committee from the Armed Department on the grounds of "unclear banner" and "weak revolutionary spirit." This comrade then declared his withdrawal from the Revolutionary Committee. This incident shocked the entire factory. "August 1st" took the opportunity to join forces with several revolutionary mass organizations that had grievances against "Work-Study," supporting the comrade from the Armed Department in withdrawing from the Revolutionary Committee, thereby putting pressure on "Work-Study." To cope with this situation, "Work-Study" joined forces with revolutionary mass organizations that shared the same views. Thus, the entire factory formed two clearly opposed factions.

This divided situation caused the revolutionary mass organizations to lose mutual trust, support, and friendship. The Revolutionary Committee was constantly drawn into the vortex of "internal warfare," handling some non-principled disputes and passively coping.

We deeply felt that without achieving revolutionary unity, we could not strengthen the revolutionary leftist forces, unite the broad masses, and completely isolate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; without achieving revolutionary unity, we could not form a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one" temporary power organ of the proletariat, could not mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and could not grasp and use power well; without achieving revolutionary unity, revolutionary mass organizations would easily breed small-groupism, individualism, factionalism, etc., which would not be conducive to ideological revolutionization.

The fundamental way to achieve revolutionary unity is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness.

The fundamental way to achieve revolutionary unity among the revolutionary masses of the proletariat is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and solve problems through rectification. However, at that time, when various revolutionary mass organizations were in a state of serious opposition, it was difficult to sit down together for rectification. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The problem is the contradiction within things.... To raise a problem, we must first conduct a rough investigation and study of the two basic aspects of the problem, i.e., the contradiction." Under the guidance of the PLA comrades who were performing the task of supporting the left, the Revolutionary Committee conducted an investigation into the situation of the opposing sides and found that the main problem was: "Work-Study" had serious factionalism and the idea of "only I am revolutionary," thus harming the feelings among comrades in dealing with other revolutionary mass organizations; "August 1st" had serious small-groupism, often seizing on minor issues and not grasping the big picture, and did not recognize the mistake of the comrade from the Armed Department withdrawing from the Revolutionary Committee at the critical moment of revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination." Thus, both opposing sides, due to "internal warfare," relaxed their struggle against the enemy and lacked sincerity in self-criticism.

Chairman Mao said: "To grasp ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." Based on Chairman Mao's teaching, to enable various revolutionary mass organizations to sit down for rectification, we must start from ideological work and solve three problems of understanding: first, correctly understand revolutionary unity and enhance the consciousness of revolutionary unity; second, how to view oneself dialectically; third, distinguish between enemies, ourselves, and friends, and correctly handle two types of contradictions of different natures.

We further analyzed that the main aspect of the contradictions among revolutionary mass organizations was in "Work-Study." Thus, the PLA comrades supporting the left and the Revolutionary Committee focused on doing ideological work with the comrades from "Work-Study." We first studied together with the comrades from "Work-Study" and jointly discussed what changes had occurred in the revolutionary situation after seizing power? What new requirements did the changed situation pose for the revolutionary forces in power? Through study, everyone agreed that after seizing power, "Work-Study" had changed from the previous oppressed and persecuted position of having no power to the position of holding all the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture in the entire factory. This change posed a very sharp question to "Work-Study": that is, to actively "organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army," and "arouse hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, unite as one." This requires us to bravely abandon sectarianism and quickly achieve revolutionary unity.

After seizing power, the thoughts of some comrades in "Work-Study" also changed. Because of victory, arrogance and the emotion of considering oneself a hero emerged. Factionalism and cliquism grew. For example, some comrades from "Work-Study" felt uncomfortable as soon as they heard other organizations mention their shortcomings and mistakes, thinking it was malicious attack, labeling others, and that the tiger's buttocks could not be touched. This posed another serious question to "Work-Study": to seize the power of the "selfishness" in one's own mind. Through the help of the PLA comrades, the comrades from "Work-Study" realized that "selfishness" seriously affected revolutionary unity, and without fiercely fighting against "selfishness," revolutionary unity could not be achieved. The PLA comrades further helped the comrades from "Work-Study" study Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution." Everyone realized that to continue the revolution, we must take up the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, use Mao Zedong Thought as the standard, and bravely reform ourselves. Because of victory, we became arrogant and despised everything; because of past merits, we were self-satisfied and arrogant; because the big direction was correct, we did not seriously examine our mistakes and criticize our shortcomings, regarding ourselves as the "permanent" "old rebels" and stopping our progress. This is against Chairman Mao's teachings. The comrades from "Work-Study" raised their ideological level and said: We must conduct rectification with a high attitude, actively examine our shortcomings and mistakes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In front of us, there are two types of social contradictions, that is, the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions within the people." After seizing power, various revolutionary mass organizations emerged with a large number of contradictions within the people. Whether we could sit down for rectification and promote revolutionary unity to a great extent also depended on whether we could correctly distinguish between two types of contradictions of different natures. For example, the comrades from "Work-Study" said: We did not unite with "August 1st" in the past, do not unite now, cannot unite at all, and cannot unite even a little. The PLA comrades let "Work-Study" bring out the contradictions with "August 1st" and repeatedly study "distinguish between two boundaries. First, is it revolutionary or counter-revolutionary? Is it Yan'an or Xi'an?" Through study, the comrades from "Work-Study" unanimously agreed that the contradictions with "August 1st" were "Yan'an" issues. Only the contradictions with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were "Xi'an" issues. Therefore, we could sit down and use the method of rectification to solve the contradictions between us. Like in the past, using tooth for tooth and eye for eye, shooting bullets at the bodies of class brothers, is extremely wrong.

After this ideological work, various revolutionary mass organizations began to have the desire to sit down for rectification.

In the rectification, we mainly solved ideological problems, mainly with self-criticism, emphasizing both unity and principles, and always highlighting class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Chairman Mao said: "We have turned the democratic method of solving contradictions within the people into a formula, which is called 'unity-criticism-unity.'" We organized the first rectification of the responsible comrades of various revolutionary mass organizations according to Chairman Mao's teaching.

This rectification, we firmly grasped four links.

First, in solving specific disputes among various revolutionary mass organizations, we emphasized solving ideological problems, using Mao Zedong Thought to recognize everything, analyze everything, solve everything, and command everything. During the rectification, we always used Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant work "On Correcting Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party" as weapons to solve ideological problems. The process of rectification was the process of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively.

Second, in this rectification, when carrying out criticism and self-criticism, we especially emphasized self-criticism and self-revolution as the main focus. On the basis of self-criticism, we extensively carried out activities of opening one's heart and talking heart to heart. Through opening one's heart and talking heart to heart, everyone actively examined mistakes and took responsibility, gaining each other's understanding and trust, and becoming closer and closer. Everyone deeply felt: only by opening one's heart can one know one's heart; only by knowing one's heart can one have a common heart; only by having a common heart can one unite as one and jointly fight against the enemy.

Third, in this rectification, we emphasized both unity and principles. We believed that for major principles, we must be clear-cut and uncompromising, which is the principledness that revolutionary forces should have; while for minor issues and non-principled disputes, we should be good at mutual understanding and compromise, allowing others to retain their opinions, and being good at seeking common ground while reserving differences. This is also the attitude that revolutionary forces should have. That kind of grabbing each other's hair, pulling each other's legs, quarreling, and venting personal grievances is not the temperament of the frank proletarian revolutionaries, but the narrow-minded character of small proprietors and the evil performance of small-groupism.

Fourth, in this rectification, we always highlighted class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. On the basis of opening one's heart, criticism, and self-criticism, the PLA comrades inspired everyone to jointly analyze the class struggle situation within the factory. Everyone, with great indignation, exposed the conspiracies of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road during the time when the revolutionary forces were fighting "internal warfare." Through exposure, the revolutionary forces enhanced their awareness of the enemy and aroused their sense of revolutionary responsibility. Some comrades said: "We fought 'internal warfare' and relaxed the revolutionary criticism, which was simply a crime." Some said: "We did the stupid thing of pleasing the enemy and angering our friends. Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? Now it is clear." The more we talked, the stronger our hatred for the enemy became, and the closer our hearts became. As we talked, we could no longer suppress our excitement, and everyone's eyes were filled with tears, involuntarily shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Everyone unanimously agreed to achieve revolutionary unity. To promote the revolutionary unity from the bottom up, we held a factory-wide meeting to report the results of the rectification and promote the unity of the revolutionary forces. At the same time, the responsible comrades of various major organizations formed workshop (department) coordination groups to go deep into the workshops and help carry out the rectification, thus achieving the revolutionary unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces throughout the factory.

"Selfishness" is a stubborn enemy and cannot be completely eliminated through one rectification. It will continue to challenge us, and we will continue to fight against it.

"Selfishness" is a stubborn enemy, and it is not realistic to think that it can be completely eliminated through one rectification. At some critical moments, it will still jump out and challenge us and fight with us. After the first rectification achieved revolutionary unity, the small-groupism and factionalism in our minds sometimes still played tricks. Some comrades still engaged in friction and made small moves, stepping on each other's heels, and could not unite as one and wholeheartedly engage in the revolution. Small-groupism made many problems unsolvable. This was prominently reflected in the issue of the establishment of the Qingdao Revolutionary Workers General Headquarters.

After the comrades from "August 1st" heard the news that the Qingdao Revolutionary Workers General Headquarters was to be established, they first made arrangements within their own organization, intending to establish the Four-Fang Machinery and Vehicle Factory Workers Headquarters with the "August 1st Squad" as the main force. The comrades from "Work-Study" heard that the comrades from "August 1st" had gone to the preparatory meeting of the General Headquarters and immediately refused to participate in the General Headquarters in a fit of anger. At that time, the leaders of various organizations often quarreled, and the revolutionary unity that had been achieved was facing the danger of breakdown.

At the critical moment, Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for us. Chairman Mao said: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the great proletarian cultural revolution to achieve victory." Chairman Mao's voice awakened our minds. Under the guidance of the stationed PLA, the factory Revolutionary Committee and others decided to immediately carry out the second rectification, summarize experiences and lessons, and thoroughly eliminate small-groupism and factionalism, overcoming the vacillation of the petty-bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao said: "We are the Communist Party. We lead the people to defeat the enemy. Our ranks must be in order, and our steps must be in unison. Our soldiers must be elite, and our weapons must be good." To consolidate the red political power and enhance our combat effectiveness, to both clarify thoughts and unite comrades, in the rectification, we paid attention to finding the social and ideological roots of mistakes. We emphasized looking at our own and our organization's shortcomings and looking at the advantages of others and other organizations. First, we carried out self-criticism, and then sincerely helped each other, opposing subjectivism and personal attacks. Therefore, in the rectification, everyone could talk heart to heart, open one's heart, and expose one's thoughts and bottom line. The main members of the Revolutionary Committee, a comrade from "Work-Study," checked with a heavy heart: "In the ten days after the great unity in March, our relationship with 'August 1st' was still okay. Later, when we saw them always doing some small tricks behind our backs, we thought that 'August 1st' was unreliable. To defend the red political power, we still had to rely on 'Work-Study.' Therefore, I was in the Revolutionary Committee in person, but my heart was in the 'Work-Study Command Department,' serving the revolution on the surface, but actually serving the small faction of 'Work-Study.' 'Work-Study' was my base." The comrades from "August 1st" also exposed their thoughts one after another. A member of the Revolutionary Committee and a responsible comrade from "August 1st" said: "I just wanted to establish another faction. Although the 'August 1st Squad' had few people, I was the boss, and everyone listened to me." On the basis of opening one's heart and exposing one's thoughts, the PLA comrades timely helped us, guided us, and made us more deeply realize that small-groupism is harmful! Small-groupism made us unable to accept many correct opinions, made many workshops below us have estrangement, and made our organization fight for power and benefits. When we could not achieve our goals, we became opposed to each other, disregarding the interests of the Party. We were not sincerely working for the interests of the Party and the people, putting our main efforts into the struggle against the enemy, but racking our brains to think of ways to deal with comrades. We were not wholeheartedly serving the people, but always wanted our faction to be higher and establish our prestige. We did not see that small-groupism was opposed by the broad masses who were sincere and genuine for the revolution. We almost became the people who pulled the cart backward. The more we talked, the more we felt ashamed and heartbroken. Through the rectification, through extensive exposure and fierce fighting against "selfishness," we changed from being enthusiastic about small-groupism to hating small-groupism. We had all made the same mistakes and were victims of small-groupism. Today, we talked heart to heart, exchanged opinions, gained understanding, deepened class feelings, and together rebelled against small-groupism, killing the counterattacks of petty-bourgeois ideology in our minds. Because we clarified the significance of the rectification, corrected our attitudes, and could bravely expose, fight, and change the "selfishness" in our minds, we could sit down and seriously read books, seriously study, and think about our mistakes. In this way, we solved one key problem after another. Therefore, this rectification achieved unity, enthusiasm, and new styles. Various organizations, on the basis of removing the wooden signs, further removed the signs in their minds, achieving ideological unity, and creating a new situation for the revolutionary criticism throughout the factory, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the revolution to promote production.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of revolutionary unity. The process of achieving revolutionary unity is the process of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview.

Reviewing the revolutionary unity we have gone through in the past few months, we have three feelings:

First, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our revolutionary forces and the soul of the revolutionary unity of the proletariat. The process of achieving the revolutionary unity of the proletariat is the process of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively and transforming our worldview, and the process of the broad masses mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

Second, "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The great People's Liberation Army is the strong backing of the revolutionary forces of the proletariat and the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the few months of holding power, the PLA has always supported us politically and ideologically with the great Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly believe in and rely on the PLA, so we have achieved great success in revolutionary unity, revolutionary criticism, and the revolution to promote production in various tasks.

Third, we must be ruthless to the enemy, friendly to comrades, and strict to ourselves. To be ruthless to the enemy and friendly to comrades, we must learn to correctly distinguish and handle two types of contradictions of different natures; to be strict to ourselves, we must always insist, especially in times of success, on dialectics, view ourselves dialectically, insist on regular rectification, fiercely fight against selfish thoughts, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. We must often make self-criticisms and be vigilant against the growth of arrogance.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great battle order to us to "criticize revisionism and fight selfishness." We are determined to follow this great policy, adhere to Chairman Mao's teaching of "being humble makes one progress, and being arrogant makes one fall behind," and further examine and summarize the great proletarian cultural revolution in our factory over the past year, launching a high tide of criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness. We are determined to redouble our efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively, hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively, take "criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness" as the guideline, fight against selfishness every day, every year, and for a lifetime. Through criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness, we will further consolidate and develop the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

    以“斗私，批修”为纲，巩固和发展革命大联合
    青岛市四方机车车辆工厂革命委员会
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经胜利地进行一年多了。一年多来的斗争经历，就是我们厂的无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派英勇斗争的“批修”过程；又是我们以毛泽东思想为武器，大学大用毛主席著作，狠触自己的灵魂，不断改造自己主观世界的“斗私”过程。
    一年多来的斗争实践，我们深深体会到：革命造反靠的是毛泽东思想，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权靠的是毛泽东思想，实现革命的大联合也靠的是毛泽东思想。我厂无产阶级革命派大联合的实现、巩固和发展，正是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我厂大联合以前，有十个革命群众组织。基本上分成以“工学指挥部”（简称“工学”）和“八一支队”（简称“八一”）为代表的两大派。“工学”夺了厂内走资本主义道路当权派的权。夺权后，“工学”的负责人程度不同地滋长了一些不健康情绪，总觉得“我们是最革命的”。因此在组织发展上总希望自己的战斗队是“纯粹又纯粹”，有着严重的关门主义倾向。这种关门主义妨碍了革命队伍的发展壮大。有些革命群众，在这种情况下参加了“八一”。这样，“工学”就认为“八一”是搞“大杂烩”。这种关门主义是和山头主义联系在一起的，他们看不起杀出来晚的、比较小的组织。恰好，“工学”和“八一”在一个车间夺权问题上发生了争执，对立起来。“八一”抓住“工学”的战斗队写错了一条毛主席语录，大造舆论。“工学”的一些同志一怒之下，连续三次用大标语向“八一”发动舆论攻势，要把“八一”打成保守组织。
    “八一”也从小团体主义出发，抓住“工学”的缺点不放，寻找时机，写“照会”，发抗议。“工学”曾以“旗帜不鲜明”，“造反精神不强”为理由，排斥一位参加了革委会的武装部的同志，这个同志便声明退出了革委会。这件事轰动了全厂。“八一”借机与几个对“工学”有意见的革命群众组织联合起来，支持武装部同志退出革委会，以此对“工学”施加压力。“工学”为了应付这种局势，联合了和自己观点相同的革命群众组织。于是全厂形成了明显对立的两大派。
    这种分裂的局面，使得革命群众组织之间失去了相互信任、支持和友谊。革委会整天被卷在“内战”的漩涡中，处理一些无原则的纠纷，被动应付。
    我们深深感到，不实现革命大联合，就不能壮大革命左派队伍，团结广大群众，把一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底孤立起来；不实现革命大联合，就不可能组成革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”的临时权力机构，不能调动广大革命群众和广大革命干部的积极性，就掌不好权，用不好权；不实现革命大联合，革命群众组织容易滋长小团体主义、个人主义、山头主义等，不利于思想革命化。
      实现革命大联合，最根本的办法是活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公
    实现无产阶级革命派大联合，最根本的办法是活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，通过整风解决问题。但是，在当时各革命群众组织处在严重对立的情况下，要想坐到一起整风，是有困难的。毛主席教导我们：“问题就是事物的矛盾。……提出问题，首先就要对于问题即矛盾的两个基本方面加以大略的调查和研究”。革委会在执行支左任务的解放军同志的帮助下，把对立双方的情况作了调查，找出了主要问题是：“工学”这方面存在着严重的山头主义、“唯我革命”思想，因此在处理与其它革命群众组织关系上伤害了同志间的感情；“八一”这方面严重地存在着小团体主义，常常抓住枝节问题不放，大方向掌握得不好，对武装部同志在革命大联合、“三结合”的关键时刻退出革委会的错误没有认识。这样，对立的双方由于打“内战”对敌斗争放松了，都缺乏自我批评的诚意。
    毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”本着毛主席这个教导，要使各革命群众组织能坐下来整风，必须从思想工作入手，解决三个认识问题：一、正确理解革命大联合，增强革命大联合的自觉性；二、如何一分为二地对待自己；三、分清敌、我、友，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾。
    我们进而分析了革命群众组织之间矛盾的主要方面是在“工学”。于是支左的解放军同志和革委会就集中力量向“工学”做思想工作。我们首先和“工学”的同志们一起学习，共同研究夺权之后，革命形势发生了什么变化？变化了的形势，对掌权的革命派提出了什么新的要求？通过学习，大家一致认为，夺权后“工学”由过去受压抑、受迫害的无权地位，变成了握有全厂党、政、财、文一切大权的掌权者。这个变化向“工学”提出了一个十分尖锐的问题：那就是积极地“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，“唤起工农千百万，同心干”。这就要求我们勇敢地抛弃关门主义，尽快地实现革命的大联合。
    掌权以后，“工学”一部分同志的思想也起了变化。因为胜利，骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪冒头了。山头主义、宗派主义滋长了。如“工学”的一些同志一听到别的组织说到自己的缺点、错误，就不舒服，就认为是恶意攻击，就扣人家“帽子”，老虎屁股摸不得。这就给“工学”提出另一个严肃的问题：夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。通过解放军同志的帮助，“工学”同志们认识到，“私”字严重地影响了革命的大联合，不狠斗“私”字，无法实现革命的大联合。解放军同志还进一步帮助“工学”同志学习林副主席的指示：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”大家认识到，要继续干革命，必须拿起批评和自我批评的武器，以毛泽东思想为标准，勇敢地革自己的命。因为胜利而骄傲自满，目空一切，因为过去的功劳而沾沾自喜，狂妄自大，因为大方向正确而不认真检讨自己的错误、批评自己的缺点，把自己当作是“永久牌”的“老造反”而停止不前，这是违反毛主席的教导的。“工学”同志们思想提高了，他们说：我们一定要以高姿态进行整风，主动检查自己的缺点和错误。
    毛主席教导我们：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。”夺权以后，各革命群众组织之间出现了大量的人民内部矛盾。我们能不能坐下来整风，促进革命大联合，在很大程度上也取决于能否正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾。比如“工学”同志说：我们和“八一”过去不联合，现在不联合，一点不能联合，半点也不能联合。解放军同志就让“工学”把对“八一”的矛盾摆出来，然后反复学习“划清两种界限。首先，是革命还是反革命？是延安还是西安？”通过学习，“工学”同志一致认为和“八一”的矛盾是“延安”问题。只有那一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和我们的矛盾才是“西安”问题。所以我们可以坐下来，用整风的方法，来解决彼此之间的矛盾。象过去那样以牙还牙，以眼还眼，把子弹打到阶级兄弟的身上，是极端错误的。
    经过这一番思想工作，各革命群众组织开始有了坐下来整风的愿望。
      在整风中，以解决思想问题为主，以自我批评为主，既强调
  团结又坚持原则，始终突出阶级斗争和两条路线斗争
    毛主席说：“我们曾经把解决人民内部矛盾的这种民主的方法，具体化为一个公式，叫做‘团结——批评——团结’。”我们就是按照毛主席这一教导组织各革命群众组织的负责人进行第一次整风的。
    这次整风，我们紧紧抓住了四个环节。
      （一）在解决各革命群众组织之间的具体纠纷时，强调以解决思想问题为主，用毛泽东思想认识一切、分析一切、解决一切、统帅一切。整风过程中，我们始终把毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，作为解决思想问题的武器。整风的过程，就是活学活用毛泽东思想的过程。
      （二）这次整风，在开展批评和自我批评的时候，特别强调以自我批评、自我革命为主。在自我批评的基础上，广泛地开展交心、谈心活动。通过亮“丑”交心，彼此都主动检查错误，承担责任，取得了对方的谅解信任，越谈心贴得越紧。大家都深有感触地说：只有交心，才能知心；只有知心，才能同心；只有同心，才能团结一致，共同对敌。
      （三）这次整风，既强调团结，又坚持原则。我们认为，对于大是大非问题，要毫不含糊，旗帜鲜明，决不妥协，这是革命派应有的原则性；而对枝节问题，无原则纠纷问题，则要善于互谅互让，允许别人保留自己的意见，善于求大同存小异，这同样是革命派应有的态度。那种互相抓辫子，互相拆台，闹意气，泄私愤的作法根本不是胸襟坦白的无产阶级革命派的脾气，而是心地狭窄的小私有者特有的性格，是小团体主义的恶劣表现。
      （四）这次整风，始终突出阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争。在交心、批评和自我批评的基础上，解放军同志启发大家共同分析厂内阶级斗争形势。同志们都以无比愤怒的心情揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派乘革命派打“内战”之时进行的阴谋活动。通过揭发，革命派增强了敌情观念，激发了革命责任感。有的同志说：“我们打‘内战’放松革命大批判，简直是犯罪。”有的说：“我们干了亲者痛，仇者快的蠢事。谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？现在看得清清楚楚。”大家越谈对敌人的仇恨越强烈，越谈同志们的心贴得越紧。谈着谈着人们再也按捺不住内心的激动，大家热泪盈眶，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”一致同意实现革命大联合。为了推动自下而上的革命大联合，我们召开了全厂性的汇报整风成果，促进革命派大联合大会。通过大会向广大革命派宣传毛泽东思想。与此同时，由各大组织的负责人组成车间（科室）归口小组，深入车间帮助开展整风，从而实现了全厂无产阶级革命派大联合。
      “私”字是一个顽敌，不是通过一次整风就能把它完全消灭
  掉的。它不断向我们挑战，我们就不断向它斗争
      “私”字是一个顽敌，不能设想通过一次整风就把它完全消灭掉了。在一些关键性时刻，它还会跳出来和我们挑战，和我们斗。第一次整风实现革命大联合之后，我们头脑里的小团体主义、山头主义有时仍然作怪，有些同志还在搞摩擦，做小动作，互相踩脚后跟，不能同心同德、一心一意搞革命。小团体主义使许多问题不能正确解决。这突出表现在对待市革命职工总司令部的成立的问题上。
      “八一”的同志知道要成立青岛市革命职工总司令部的消息后，先在自己组织内部布置，想以“八一支队”为主成立四方机车车辆工厂职工司令部。“工学”的同志一听说“八一”的同志去参加了总司令部筹备会议，就赌气不参加总司令部。当时各组织的头头常常吵架，已经实现的革命大联合面临破裂的危险。
    在关键时刻，毛主席给我们指出了方向。毛主席他老人家说：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”毛主席的声音清醒了我们的头脑，在驻厂解放军的帮助下，厂革委会等研究决定，立即搞第二次整风，总结经验教训，彻底铲除小团体主义、山头主义，克服小资产阶级的摇摆性。
    毛主席说：“我们是共产党，我们要领导人民打倒敌人，我们的队伍就要整齐，我们的步调就要一致，兵要精，武器要好。”为了巩固红色政权，增强我们的战斗力，为了既要弄清思想，又要团结同志，在整风中，我们注意找出犯错误的社会根源和思想根源。我们强调对自己和自己的组织多看缺点，对别人对别的组织多看优点。首先开展自我批评，然后诚恳地互相帮助，反对主观武断和个人攻击，因此整风中大家能够做到谈心，交心，亮思想，亮底板。革委会的主要成员、“工学”的一个同志以沉重的心情检查说：“三月份大联合以后的十几天中，我们和‘八一’的关系还不错，后来一看他们老在背后干一些小动作，就想到‘八一’是靠不住的，要捍卫红色政权，还得靠‘工学’。因此，我人在革委会，心在‘工学指挥部’，表面为革命服务，实际为‘工学’这个小山头服务。‘工学’是我的根据地。”“八一”的同志也纷纷暴露自己的思想。革委会成员、“八一”的负责人说：“我就想另立山头，别看‘八一支队’人不多，可是我说了算，都听我的。”在交心亮思想的基础上，解放军同志及时地帮助我们，引导我们，使我们更深刻地认识到小团体主义害人不浅！小团体主义害得我们对许多正确的意见不能接受，害得下面许多车间的群众之间闹隔阂。小团体主义为自己的组织争权争利，达不到目的就闹对立，置党的利益于不顾。我们不是为党的利益，人民的利益而诚诚恳恳地工作，把主要精力用在对敌斗争上，而是绞了不少脑汁想主意去对付同志。我们不是全心全意为人民服务，而是总想自己的山头高一些，为自己树威信。我们看不到小团体主义是广大真心实意为革命的群众所反对的，我们几乎成了拉车屁股向后的人。越谈越想，越感到惭愧和痛心。通过整风，通过大摆、大亮、狠斗“私”字，我们就从热中小团体主义而改变为厌恶小团体主义。我们过去都是犯同样的错误，都是小团体主义的受害者，今天谈了心，交换了意见，取得了谅解，加深了阶级感情，就一起来造小团体主义的反，狠杀自己头脑里小资产阶级思想的回马枪。由于我们明确整风的意义，端正了态度，对自己头脑里的“私”字能狠亮、狠斗、狠改，能够坐下来比较认真地读书，认真地学习，思考自己的错误，就这样解决了一个一个的重点问题。因此，这次整风整出了团结，整出了干劲，整出了新作风。各组织在摘掉了木头牌子的基础上，进而摘掉了思想上的牌子，实现了思想上的大联合，使全厂的革命大批判，革命的“三结合”，抓革命、促生产，都出现了一个新的局面。
      战无不胜的毛泽东思想是革命大联合的灵魂。实现革命大联
  合的过程，就是用毛泽东思想改造世界观的过程
    回顾几个月来走过的革命大联合的道路，我们有三点体会：
    一、战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们革命派的命根子，是革命派大联合的灵魂。实现无产阶级革命派大联合的过程，就是活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观的过程，就是广大群众掌握毛泽东思想的过程。
    二、“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”伟大的中国人民解放军是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，是无产阶级专政的强大柱石。掌权的几个月来，解放军事事、处处、时时都用伟大的毛泽东思想从政治上、思想上支持我们。我们坚决相信和依靠解放军，所以才在革命大联合、革命大批判、抓革命促生产各项工作中，取得了很大成绩。
    三、对敌人要狠，对战友要和，对自己要严。要作到对敌人狠，对战友和，必须学会正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾；要作到对己严，必须随时坚持，特别是在顺利的时候坚持辩证法，对自己一分为二，坚持经常性整风，狠斗私心杂念，在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。要多作自我批评，随时警惕骄傲情绪的滋长。
    最近，伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号令。我们决心按照这一伟大方针，遵照毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，戒骄戒躁，进一步对我们厂一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命进行检查和总结，掀起一个斗私批修的高潮。我们决心更加百倍努力地大学大用毛主席著作，大办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，时时斗私，天天斗私，年年斗私，斗到老，斗一辈子。通过斗私批修，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
