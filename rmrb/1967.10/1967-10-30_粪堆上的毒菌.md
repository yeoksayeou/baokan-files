Forty-six years ago, in an article titled "The Fourth Anniversary of the October Revolution," Lenin compared the decaying and dark tsarist Russia to a "filthy stable." He solemnly declared that the stormy winds of the October Revolution had already cleaned up these "filthy stables."

Now, as the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, people see that a small clique of Soviet revisionist traitors, led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, has once again turned the places that Lenin and Stalin led the Soviet people to clean up into "filthy stables." The Soviet revisionist literature and arts are like a pile of stinking manure in this "stable."

In today's Soviet revisionist literary and artistic circles, poisonous weeds are rampant, and mold is everywhere. Whether it is novels, poetry, drama, films, fine arts, or music, they all exude the decaying and declining atmosphere of the bourgeoisie, completely becoming branches and copies of Western reactionary literature and arts. They attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and defame the socialist system. They advocate selfishness and peddle Western lifestyles. They depict the horrors of war and promote the philosophy of survival. They glorify American imperialism and madly engage in anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and counter-revolutionary activities. Through various channels, they spew out a large amount of poison, corrupting the minds of the Soviet people. The stinking things that the Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly peddle are what they vigorously promote as the so-called "culture for all people." Isn't this absurd!

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and to a certain political line." In capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie uses decadent, declining, and reactionary bourgeois culture and literature and art to poison the broad masses of the people, diverting their attention from class struggle, to maintain their reactionary rule. The Soviet revisionist clique is the political representative of a small group of bourgeois privileged classes in the Soviet Union. They are implementing a political line of fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. Therefore, they must inevitably peddle bourgeois culture that serves this counter-revolutionary line, using various decadent, declining, and reactionary goods to numb and poison the Soviet people, to maintain their bourgeois dictatorship's small court.

The more the Soviet revisionist clique strives to cultivate literary and artistic poisonous weeds and peddle these reactionary bourgeois goods, the more they expose their shameful faces of betraying the October Revolution, betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat, betraying the great Lenin, and betraying the Soviet people. The Soviet people will never tolerate the spread of these literary and artistic poisonous weeds and mold in the homeland of the October Revolution. One day, they will surely take up the revolutionary broom and sweep away the dung heaps in these "filthy stables," along with their owners, as Lenin said, clean them up completely!

    粪堆上的毒菌
    四十六年以前，列宁在《十月革命四周年》的一篇文章中，把腐朽黑暗的沙皇俄国比作“肮脏的马厩”，并且庄严地宣布：十月革命的急风暴雨，已经把“这些肮脏的马厩”打扫干净了。
    现在，当十月革命五十周年来临的时候，人们看到，以勃列日?夫、柯西金为首的一小撮苏修叛徒，又重新把列宁斯大林领导苏联人民打扫干净的地方，变成了“肮脏的马厩”。而苏修的文艺就是这个“马厩”中的一堆臭不可闻的粪土。
    在今天的苏修文艺领域里，毒草丛生，霉菌遍地。无论是小说、诗歌、戏剧、电影、美术或音乐，都散发出资产阶级腐朽没落的气息，完全成了西方资产阶级反动文艺的分支和翻版。它们攻击无产阶级专政，丑化社会主义制度。它们宣扬利己主义，贩卖西方生活方式。它们渲染战争恐怖，鼓吹活命哲学。它们美化美帝国主义，疯狂地进行反共反华反革命。它们通过形形色色的渠道，喷发出大量的毒液，腐蚀着苏联人民的心灵。苏修集团厚颜无耻地贩卖的这些臭不可闻的东西，就是苏修集团极力宣扬所谓“为一切人”的“全民文化”，这岂不是活见鬼！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”在资本主义国家里，资产阶级就是用腐朽、没落、反动的资产阶级文化和文学艺术，来毒害广大人民，转移他们对阶级斗争的注意，来维持其反动统治。苏修集团是苏联一小撮资产阶级特权阶层的政治代表。他们推行的是在苏联全面复辟资本主义的政治路线。因此他们也就必然要竭力贩卖为这条反革命路线服务的资产阶级文化，用各种腐朽、没落、反动的货色来麻痹和毒害苏联人民，以维护他们的资产阶级专政的小朝廷。
    苏修集团越是费尽心血来培植文艺毒草，推销这些资产阶级的反动货色，就越是暴露他们背叛十月革命，背叛无产阶级专政，背叛伟大列宁，背叛苏联人民的可耻面目。苏联人民决不会容忍在十月革命的故乡让这些文艺的毒草霉菌泛滥成灾。他们终有一天会举起革命的铁扫帚，把苏修集团这些“肮脏的马厩”中的粪堆，连同它们的物主，象列宁所说的那样，打扫个一干二净！
