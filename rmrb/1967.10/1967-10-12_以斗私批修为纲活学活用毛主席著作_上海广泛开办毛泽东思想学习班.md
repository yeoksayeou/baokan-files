In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the high tide of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great unity, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai have widely established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. These classes arm the proletarian revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, helping them to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and have effectively promoted Shanghai's revolutionary criticism, great unity, the "three-in-one combination," and the struggle-criticism-transformation of their own units.

The New Type of Study Class

This new type of study class emerged to meet the needs of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The great "January Revolution" seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. However, the enemy does not willingly accept their own demise. They, with tenfold ferocity and a hundredfold hatred, are making desperate struggles. One particularly vicious and cunning tactic is to exploit every weakness in our revolutionary ranks, incite splits, provoke internal strife, divert the direction of struggle, and attempt to undermine the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and usurp the fruits of the revolution. Various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas that have influenced the revolutionary ranks are precisely the gaps through which the class enemy attacks. To resist the corruption and infiltration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, the proletarian revolutionary masses urgently need to further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

As early as mid-May, some revolutionary mass organizations demanded to sit down and study Chairman Mao's works to gain a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and firmly grasp the direction of advance. This demand was warmly supported by the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and thus the Mao Zedong Thought study classes were born. In June, the Shanghai *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* introduced and promoted the successful experience of the Chemical Industry Liaison Station of the Shanghai Workers' General Headquarters in holding study classes. Currently, from urban districts to rural areas, from leading organs to grassroots units, and even in workshops and neighborhood alleys, study classes are being widely established.

Raising the Level of Mao Zedong Thought Among the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, none of the Party's political tasks can be fulfilled." The study classes, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have set the policy of fundamentally raising the level of Mao Zedong Thought among the students.

When comrades arrive at the study class, they want to bring out all their problems and seek solutions. However, the study class asks everyone to first sit down and seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant works and instructions, fundamentally raising their proletarian political consciousness and learning to use Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's teachings on class analysis to assess political situations and as a guiding principle for observing and solving all problems.

The first issue the study class needs to address is to make everyone realize that the proletarian revolutionary masses have seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, but class struggle has not ended. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is still sharply before us. Only by using the perspective of class struggle can we grasp the essence of things from complex phenomena and find the correct methods to solve problems; without class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, it is impossible to correctly analyze political situations, and errors will be made. Through study, some comrades checked themselves, saying: "Sometimes the reason for misjudging the situation is that we forgot Chairman Mao's repeated teachings on class analysis and the struggle between the two lines."

Next, it is necessary to make everyone realize that when the proletarian revolutionary masses seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they must at the same time seize power from the "selfishness" in their own minds. "Criticizing revisionism" must go hand in hand with "struggling against selfishness." Only by thoroughly struggling against "selfishness" can the struggle against revisionism be carried to the end. Some comrades said well: "Revolution with 'selfishness' is not a complete and thorough revolution," "If we do not seize power from the 'selfishness' in our own minds, then the power we have seized may not be in the hands of the proletariat," "'Selfishness' and 'power' together may lead to the repetition of the errors of the bourgeois reactionary line, and capitalism may be restored through our hands."

Many study classes insist on fundamentally raising the level of Mao Zedong Thought among the students, rather than solving specific problems one by one, and have achieved good results. The level of Mao Zedong Thought among the students has been raised, and their understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deepened, making many specific problems easy to solve.

Following Chairman Mao's Strategic Deployment and Firmly Grasping the Direction of Struggle

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the most important thing is to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of struggle. This has become the basic guiding principle for holding study classes. At the same time, the participants in the study are all from the front lines of intense and busy struggles, which determines that the study classes can only be short in duration, concise in content, focused, and solve one or two problems in a solid manner. Such study classes are lively, vibrant, and combative, and have won the support and approval of the masses, which is completely different from those study classes that are detached from reality and "close the door for self-cultivation."

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes on various fronts in Shanghai are basically run in this way and have achieved relatively significant results. These study classes, in terms of content, mainly study Chairman Mao's relevant works and the latest instructions according to different needs, study the speeches of central responsible comrades, and the relevant editorials and articles of the *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine. The "Three Articles" are mandatory reading for every study class. From the problems they solve, there are generally three types: one type promotes revolutionary great unity, one type carries out revolutionary great criticism, and another type specially helps cadres who have made mistakes to study. The first two types of study classes account for the majority.

The revolutionary great unity study classes usually invite the responsible comrades of the two factions, or even three or five factions, to study together. At the beginning, due to the internal strife that had been going on for some time, it was quite difficult for them to sit on the same bench to study. Some refused to come, some prepared to "fight it out," and some thought that "the two sides have different directions and are principled differences, so there is no question of unity."

However, after they armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought in the study, the situation quickly changed, and many moving incidents occurred. In some study classes, the responsible comrades of different factions had stern faces on the first day, and internal strife was on the verge of breaking out; on the second day, although they did not speak to each other, they said their own things, but their faces improved; on the third and fourth days, they began to talk and laugh, and after a week, they sat together to discuss the unity plan. When the responsible comrades of the two revolutionary organizations of the Shanghai Electric Meter Factory first came to the study class to study, they also did not speak to each other and even refused to sit together to discuss. However, Mao Zedong Thought illuminated their hearts, and as soon as the study class ended, the ten comrades who participated in the study from both sides jointly wrote an open letter to all the revolutionary masses of the factory, calling for an end to internal strife and unity to jointly fight against the enemy, which was welcomed by the masses.

After the publication of Peng Zhen's article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai, with immense class hatred, launched a high tide of criticism against China's Khrushchev. However, some comrades did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the revolutionary great criticism. Some thought that China's Khrushchev was invisible and inaudible, and that the great criticism was "firing blanks" and "shelling from a distance," with no meaning. Some thought that China's Khrushchev was already a "dead tiger." These ideas hindered the broader, deeper, and more sustained development of the great criticism movement.

In response to this situation, some units specially held great criticism study classes. The study classes, through the study of documents and the conduct of great criticism activities in the class, focused on raising everyone's understanding of the strategic significance of the revolutionary great criticism. In the study, everyone realized that China's Khrushchev was not a "dead tiger" but a "fallen dog," and if not beaten hard, it would one day come back to bite. Some comrades said: "The Cultural Revolution is a profound ideological revolution. If we do not carry out great criticism, do not thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, after a few years or decades, they may 'borrow a corpse to return to life,' which would cause a great historical retrogression." Through the actual criticism activities, those who originally thought that the great criticism was "firing blanks" and "shelling from a distance" also deeply felt that this was a "close combat" and a "melee." Everyone realized that the revolutionary great criticism is a strategic decisive battle against revisionism and the prevention of revisionism, a great classroom for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and a great school for breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness to achieve the ideological revolutionization.

Insisting on Implementing the Spirit of Rectification and Seriously Carrying Out Self-Criticism

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because of victory, arrogance, the tendency to consider oneself a hero, the tendency to stop and not seek progress, the tendency to seek enjoyment and not want to live a hard life, may grow within the Party." The problems pointed out by Chairman Mao here are also reflected to some extent among some comrades within the proletarian revolutionary ranks. Some comrades think that their "tiger's ass" cannot be touched, and when they hear some opinions, they "fly into a rage." Some comrades are "the only leftist" and "the only revolutionary," and small-groupism and factionalism are very serious. This thinking, at the critical juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seriously hinders revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great unity, and interferes with the direction of struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideas within our ranks to the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory.

How to "guide"? Many study classes have done two things: insisting on seriously studying Chairman Mao's works and insisting on the spirit of rectification. Many study classes repeatedly organized the study of Chairman Mao's relevant sayings on criticism and self-criticism, and around how to correctly treat oneself, comrades, the masses, and the proletarian headquarters, as well as for whom to hold power, how to hold power well, and how to use power well, they inspired everyone to carry out self-criticism. The study meetings were filled with a good atmosphere of self-criticism. In the "January Revolution," the three revolutionary mass organizations of the Great Pharmaceutical Factory had been fighting "internal wars" for a long time, picking on each other's faults, and there was no question of self-criticism. Later, the three organizations each sent representatives to participate in the study class held by the chemical system. After studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People* and the saying "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent marks that distinguish us from other parties," they raised their consciousness, and all three sides did not criticize others but focused on self-criticism, quickly resolving long-standing contradictions, and achieving revolutionary great unity. Some comrades in practice truly did "expose thoughts without fear of ugliness, analyze and criticize without fear of pain, and correct errors without fear of difficulty." They said: "We are the proletarian revolutionary masses. Towards the bourgeois headquarters, we can only 'rebel' and not 'protect.' Towards the bourgeois headquarters in our own minds, we must also dare to fight to the death, 'seize every inch of power,' to forever preserve our revolutionary youth."

Masses Teach, Masses Learn

Many study classes in Shanghai resolutely adopted the mass line method of "masses teach, masses learn" and resolutely abandoned the past "closed-door reading" and "political training" teaching methods of some study classes.

The entire activity of the study class is closely linked with the revolutionary mass movement of the unit and the system. What is the focus of this term's study class? What problems need to be solved? What tendencies need to be paid attention to? Before the class starts, the staff of the study class would go deep into factories, shops, and neighborhoods to discuss with the masses. During the study, the participating comrades would promptly report the situation of the study class to their system and unit, and propagate to the broad masses. Some units' masses would send representatives to participate in the study group meetings, listen to the participating comrades' thoughts, share their experiences, understand the progress of the study, and sometimes participate in debates and post big-character posters. In this way, the study inside the class and the movement outside the class are combined, making the study class lively and full of vitality. After one term of the study class ends, some staff of the study class would follow the students back to their units to help them implement what they have learned into practice, carry out revolutionary great criticism, and achieve revolutionary great unity.

In addition to inviting responsible comrades of a certain level to speak about the situation when the class starts, there are no special teachers. The teachers come from two aspects: one is to invite advanced units to introduce their experiences, and the other is the students of the study class. Whoever studies well is invited to tutor, and whoever is the teacher. This is the best teacher and also the teacher most welcomed by the students. The responsibility of the organizers of the study class is: guided by Mao Zedong Thought, to be good at concentrating and promoting the advanced thoughts and experiences of the masses, to nurture and cultivate the advanced sprouts of the masses, and to summarize and promote them.

Many leading cores of the study classes have absorbed the backbone of the students. These backbones come from the front lines of struggle, have very rich struggle experience, and are very beneficial for strengthening the leadership of study. The study class, from formulating plans, studying learning methods to summarizing experiences, etc., are all done by the students themselves, changing the practice of "leadership research, masses implement" and greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the students. At the same time, the process of the students doing these tasks is also a good learning process.

　　以斗私批修为纲活学活用毛主席著作
　　上海广泛开办毛泽东思想学习班
    学习班的基本指导原则是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。学习内容主要是毛主席的有关著作和最新指示以及中央负责同志的讲话。“老三篇”是必读文件。许多学习班都坚持整风精神，着重开展自我批评，并采用群众教、群众学的群众路线方法。学习班的整个活动同本单位本系统的运动紧密结合，有力地促进了革命大批判、大联合、“三结合”和本单位的斗批改
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，在革命大批判、革命大联合高潮中，上海无产阶级革命派广泛开办了毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派的头脑，帮助无产阶级革命派“斗私，批修”，有力地促进了上海的革命大批判、大联合、“三结合”和本单位的斗批改。
    无产阶级革命派的要求  无产阶级革命派的创造
    这种新型学习班，是适应无产阶级革命派的需要而产生的。伟大的“一月革命”夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。但是，敌人是不甘心于他们自己的死亡的，他们以十倍的疯狂，百倍的仇恨，进行垂死的挣扎。其中一个特别阴险毒辣的手段，就是千方百计寻找我们革命队伍中的弱点，煽动分裂，挑起武斗，转移斗争大方向，妄想瓦解无产阶级专政的基础，篡夺革命的胜利果实。形形色色的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想在革命队伍中发生的影响，正是阶级敌人进攻的缺口。为了抵制资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的腐蚀、侵袭，无产阶级革命派迫切需要进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来。
    早在五月中旬，一些革命群众组织就要求坐定下来学习毛主席著作，更深刻地理解毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，牢牢把握前进的航向。这个要求得到了市革命委员会的热烈支持，于是毛泽东思想学习班诞生了。六月，上海《文汇报》《解放日报》第一次介绍、推广了工总司化工联络总站举办学习班的成功经验。目前，从市区到农村，从领导机关到基层单位，以至车间、街道里弄，都在纷纷举办学习班。
    从根本上提高无产阶级革命派的毛泽东思想水平
    毛主席教导说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”学习班按照毛主席的教导，确定了从根本上来提高学员毛泽东思想水平的方针。
    参加学习的同志一到学习班，就想把自己所带的问题统统端出来，要求帮助解决。学习班却要大家先坐定下来，认真学习毛主席的有关著作和指示，从根本上来提高无产阶级政治觉悟，学会用毛泽东思想，用毛主席教导的阶级分析方法，去估量政治形势和作为观察、解决一切问题的指导方针。
    学习班第一个需要解决的，就是使大家认识到，无产阶级革命派从组织上夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，阶级斗争并未结束，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争仍然尖锐地摆在我们的面前。只有用阶级斗争的观点去观察问题，才能从错综复杂的现象中抓住事物的根本，才能得出解决问题的正确方法；离开了阶级斗争、两条路线的斗争，就不可能正确分析政治形势，就要犯错误。通过学习，有些同志检查说：“有的时候所以错误估计形势，最根本的原因就是忘记了毛主席一再教导我们的阶级分析方法，忘记了两条路线的斗争。”
    其次要使大家认识到，无产阶级革命派在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，必须同时夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。“批修”必须“斗私”。只有很好地斗掉了“私”字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。有些同志说得好：“带着‘私’字去革命，就不可能是完全、彻底的革命”，“不夺自己头脑中‘私’字的权，那末，已经夺到的权，也还可能不在无产阶级手中”，“‘私’字和‘权’字连在一起，就可能重犯资产阶级反动路线的错误，资本主义就可能通过我们的手复辟。”
    许多学习班坚持从根本上提高学员的毛泽东思想水平，而不是就事论事地解决一个个具体问题，收到了良好的效果。学员的毛泽东思想水平提高了，对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的理解更深刻了，许多具体问题就迎刃而解了。
    紧跟毛主席战略部署  牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，最重要的问题就是紧跟毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。这一点就成了举办学习班的基本指导原则。同时，参加学习的人，都是从紧张、繁忙的斗争第一线调来的，这就规定了学习班只能是时间短、内容精，中心突出，扎扎实实解决一两个问题。这样的学习班生动活泼，富有战斗性，得到群众的支持和拥护，这是和那种脱离实际，“闭门修养”的学习班完全不同的。
    上海各条战线上的毛泽东思想学习班，基本上都是这样办的，取得了比较显著的效果。这些学习班，从学习内容说，主要是根据不同需要，分别学习毛主席的有关著作和最新指示，学习中央负责同志的讲话和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志的有关社论和文章。而
  “老三篇”则是每个学习班的必读文件。从他们所解决的问题来看，大体有三类：一类是促进革命的大联合，一类是开展革命的大批判。还有一类则是专门帮助犯错误的干部学习的。前两类学习班占大多数。
    革命大联合学习班，通常是把有分歧的两派，以至三派、五派的负责人同时邀来学习。开始，由于各派之间打了一段时间的“内战”，要坐在一条板凳上学习，是比较困难的。有的不肯来，有的准备来“干一场”，有的则认为“双方大方向不一致，是原则分歧，谈不上联合。”
    但是，当他们在学习中用毛泽东思想武装头脑以后，局面很快改观，出现了许多感人的事迹。在有些学习班上，不同派别的负责人第一天来面孔铁板，“内战”颇有一触即发之势；第二天虽然不理不睬，各说各的，但面色好转；第三第四天就有说有笑，一星期之后就坐在一起商议联合方案了。上海电表厂两大革命组织负责人开始到学习班学习时，也是不理不睬，甚至不愿坐到一起讨论。但是毛泽东思想照亮了他们的心，学习班一结束，双方参加学习的十个同志联名向全厂的革命派写了一封公开信，呼吁停止“内战”，联合起来共同对敌，受到了群众的欢迎。
    戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一文发表后，上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，怀着无比的阶级仇恨，掀起了批判中国赫鲁晓夫的高潮。但是，有些同志对革命大批判的意义还没有足够的认识。有的认为中国赫鲁晓夫看不见，听不着，大批判是“空对空”，“隔山炮”，没啥意思。有的认为中国赫鲁晓夫已经是“死老虎”。这些思想，妨碍了大批判运动更广泛、深入、持久的开展。
    针对这种情况，有些单位专门举办了大批判学习班。学习班通过学习文件和在班上开展大批判活动等方法，着重提高大家对革命大批判战略意义的认识。在学习中，大家认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫并不是“死老虎”，而是只“落水狗”，倘若不痛打，有朝一日是要爬上岸来咬人的。有些同志说：“文化大革命是一场深刻的思想革命，如若不搞大批判，不把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭，过了几年，几十年，他们就有可能‘借尸还魂’，那就会造成历史的大倒退。”通过联系实际的批判活动，那些原来认为大批判是“空对空”、“隔山炮”的同志，也深深地感到这是一场刺刀见红的“白刃战”，“肉搏战”。大家都认识到，革命的大批判是一场反修、防修的战略决战，是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，是破私立公实现思想革命化的大学校。
    坚持贯彻整风精神  认真开展自我批评
    毛主席教导我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”毛主席在这里指出的问题，在无产阶级革命派内部一些同志的身上，也有所反映。有些同志“老虎屁股摸不得”，听到一些意见，就“火冒八丈高”。有些同志“唯我独左”，
  “唯我独革”，小团体主义、山头主义十分严重。这种思想，在无产阶级文化大革命的转折关头，严重地妨碍着革命大批判和革命大联合，干扰了斗争大方向。
    毛主席教导我们：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。
    如何“引导”？许多学习班都做到了两个“坚持”：坚持认真学习毛主席著作，坚持整风精神。许多学习班反复组织学习毛主席有关批评和自我批评的语录，围绕怎样正确对待自己、对待战友、对待群众、对待无产阶级司令部以及为谁掌权、怎样掌好权、用好权等问题，启发大家进行自我批评。学习会上充满了良好的自我批评的气氛。大众制药厂在“一月革命”中夺权以后，三个革命群众组织，长期打“内战”，相互之间揪小辫子，根本谈不上自我批评。后来，三个组织都派出代表参加了化工系统举办的学习班。在学习了毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》以及“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一”等语录以后，提高了觉悟，三方面都不去批评别人，而是着重进行自我批评，很快消除了长期没有解决的矛盾，实现了革命大联合。有些同志在实践中真正做到了“暴露思想不怕丑，分析批判不怕痛，改正错误不怕难。”他们说：“我们是无产阶级革命派，对资产阶级司令部，只能‘革’，不能‘保’，对自己头脑中的资产阶级司令部，也要敢于刺刀见红，‘寸权必夺’，才能永葆我们革命的青春。”
    群众教　群众学
    上海许多学习班坚决采用了群众教、群众学的群众路线方法，坚决抛弃了过去某些学习班“闭门读书”和“训政”式的教学方法。
    学习班的整个活动是同本单位、本系统的革命群众运动紧密结合的。这一期学习班的中心是什么？要解决什么问题？注意什么倾向？在开班之前，学习班的工作人员，就深入工厂、商店、街道，和群众一起商量。在学习过程中，参加学习的同志及时把学习班的情况向本系统、本单位报告，向广大群众宣传。有些单位的群众则派了代表参加学习小组会，听参加学习的同志敞思想，谈体会，了解学习的进程，有时还参加辩论，贴大字报。这样，会内学习和会外运动相结合，就把学习班办活了，整个学习班充满了生气。在一期学习班结束后，有些学习班的工作人员还跟着学员一起回到单位，帮助他们把学到的东西贯彻到实践中去，开展革命的大批判，实现革命的大联合。
    学习班除了开学时请某一级的负责同志讲讲形势外，没有专门的教员。教员来自两个方面，一是请先进单位介绍经验，一是学习班的学员，谁学得好，就请谁辅导，谁就是教员。这是最好的教员，也是学员最欢迎的教员。学习班组织者的责任就是：以毛泽东思想为指导，善于把群众中的先进思想、先进经验集中起来，加以发扬光大，把群众中的先进萌芽加以扶植培育，总结推广。
    许多学习班的领导核心，都吸收学员中的骨干参加。这些骨干来自斗争第一线，有非常丰富的斗争经验，对加强学习领导有很大好处。学习班从制定计划、研究学习方法到总结经验等等，都由学员自己动手，改变了那种“领导研究，群众照办”的做法，大大发挥了学员的积极性和创造性。同时，学员进行这些工作过程的本身，也就是一种很好的学习。
