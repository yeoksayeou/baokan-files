Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao teaches us to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the fundamental policies to ensure the complete victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to prevent the restoration of capitalism, to strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to turn the entire country into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought. We enthusiastically support, resolutely respond to, and resolutely carry out the great commander's battle orders. We must charge into the battlefield of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and achieve new merits for the people.

Comrade Vice Chairman Lin said, "These two tasks are interconnected. Only by thoroughly fighting against selfishness can we carry the struggle against revisionism to the end." The "private" is the root of "revisionism," the seed of the restoration of capitalism. To overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, we must also overthrow the "private" in our minds. While we are waging a great struggle against "revisionism," we must also wage a great struggle against "selfishness." The two great struggles are for the completion of one strategic task: to uproot revisionism. To eradicate the weeds, one must pull out the roots. If we do not fight against selfishness, even if we overthrow one Chinese Khrushchev today, another revisionist will emerge from selfishness tomorrow, and our country will still face the danger of changing color.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have the courage and strength to fight against selfishness, dare to fight, know how to fight, and win every time. My experience in using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against selfishness is: to study and apply the "Three Articles" thoroughly, and to fight against the "private" thoughts of a moment.

Chairman Mao teaches us to be "selfless and public-spirited," to learn from Comrade White's spirit of "having no personal gain or loss." To achieve selflessness, we must constantly fight against selfishness, and as soon as the "private" thought appears, we must seize it and eliminate it with Mao Zedong Thought. Everything in the world changes from quantity to quality. The "private" in our minds is the same; if we do not fight against it in time, it will accumulate and turn into revisionism. Even if selfish thoughts are just fleeting, we must not be complacent and let them pass. We must regard them as the claws of revisionism invading our minds, as a step towards the danger of revisionism. If we do not fight against the "private" thoughts of a moment in our daily lives and thoroughly transform our worldview, we will become deserters of the revolution in critical moments.

The "private" thoughts of a moment are the breakthrough point for class enemies to attack our souls. To fight against the "private," we must start with the "private" thoughts of a moment. We must eliminate it at the forefront as soon as the "private" thought begins to attack the "public."

How can we seize the "private" thoughts of a moment? We must set a high standard in our minds and have a mirror to expose demons, so that we can discover and seize the "private" thought as soon as it appears. This high standard is Mao Zedong Thought, and this mirror is the "Three Articles." Chairman Mao teaches us in the "Three Articles" to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people.

The core of the "Three Articles" is the "public." Comrades Zhang Side and White are shining examples of being public-spirited throughout their lives. If we study the "Three Articles" well, we will plant the root of the "public" in our minds, have a standard of right and wrong, and be able to use the "public" to examine every minute of our lives, and eliminate the "private" in its budding stage with Mao Zedong Thought. Once, while performing a camp construction task, I encountered danger, and my mind flashed with a thought of fear. At that moment, Chairman Mao's teaching, "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai," and the image of Comrade Zhang Side, suddenly surged in my heart. The "public" pushed back the "private," and Mao Zedong Thought encouraged me to complete the task. After work, I studied the "Three Articles" with this issue in mind and had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings. Through this incident, I realized that heroes like Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang could sacrifice themselves and stand out in critical moments because they had studied the "Three Articles" thousands of times in their daily lives and armed themselves with Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts. In the critical moment of life and death, what shone in their minds was the golden "public" of communism.

Seizing the "private" thoughts of a moment does not mean eliminating the "private." We must fight fiercely. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, if you do not attack them, they will not fall." The "private" is a stubborn enemy; if you do not attack it, it will attack you. To fight against the "private" thoughts of a moment, we must carry out the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," launch an offensive battle, and dare to fight to the death. The "private" thoughts of a moment are invisible to others; it all depends on oneself to search and expose. We must not be afraid of being ugly, not be afraid of pain, not hesitate, not be coy, and certainly not "close the door to cultivate." The more filthy things in the depths of the soul, the more they must be exposed to the masses, relying on Mao Zedong Thought and the masses' criticism and help to completely eliminate them. To fight against the "private," we must also fight a "war of attrition." Class struggle is long-term, and the "private" in our minds will inevitably reappear. This period, this issue is overcome, but after a period, another issue will pop up. To fight against the "private" thoughts of a moment is to fight all the time, repeatedly, to revolutionize for a lifetime, and to fight against the "private" for a lifetime. Weeds pulled out can fertilize the field. Fighting against the "private" once increases one's immunity and establishes one's "public." When the "private" is completely eliminated, the "public" will take root.

To fight against the "private" thoughts of a moment, we must raise the banner of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the greatest "public," and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by the Chinese Khrushchev is the greatest "private." In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must raise the struggle of eliminating the "private" and establishing the "public" to a new level. We must care about state affairs, actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fight against the "private" thoughts of a moment in the struggle over the line, eliminate the great "private," establish the great "public," and build an iron wall of the "public" in our minds.

Whether we can fight against the "private" thoughts of a moment ultimately depends on whether we are loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With the "private," there are two command centers in the mind, and it is impossible to love Chairman Mao unconditionally, to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and to stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by thoroughly eliminating the "private" can we have only Chairman Mao in our hearts, be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and remain steadfast even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble.

I am a new soldier, and I am still far from the Party's and Chairman Mao's requirements. I have done very little for the people. I will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for our younger generation. I will always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, regard studying Chairman Mao's works as the first need of life, study the "Three Articles" for a lifetime, fight against the "private" for a lifetime, criticize revisionism for a lifetime, learn from the masses for a lifetime, and revolutionize for a lifetime, forever being a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

　　狠学狠用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字“一闪念”
　　年四旺
　　最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，要斗私，批修。毛主席的最新指示，是保证我国无产阶级文化大革命取得全面彻底胜利的根本方针，是防止资本主义复辟、加强和巩固无产阶级专政，把全国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的根本方针。我们最最热烈拥护、最最坚决响应、最最坚决执行伟大统帅的战斗号令，一定要在斗私批修的战场上，冲锋陷阵，为人民立新功。
    林副主席说，斗私，批修“这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”“私”字是“修”字的根子，是复辟资本主义的祸种。我们要打倒以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，必须同时打倒自己头脑里的“私”字。我们在同“修”字进行大决战的同时，也要同“私”字进行大决战。两个大决战，是为了完成一个战略任务，挖掉修正主义的根子。斩草必须除根。如果不斗掉“私”字，今天打倒了一个中国赫鲁晓夫，明天还会从“私”字里产生新的修正主义，我们的国家仍然有改变颜色的危险。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是斗私批修最锐利的武器。掌握了毛泽东思想，斗私就有了勇气，有了力量，就敢斗，会斗，一斗就胜。用毛泽东思想斗私，我的体会是：狠学狠用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字“一闪念”。
    毛主席教导我们，要“大公无私”，要学习白求恩同志“毫无自私自利之心的精神”。要做到无私，就必须时刻斗私，在“私”字刚一露头的时候，就狠狠地揪住它，用毛泽东思想消灭它。世界上一切事物都是由量变到质变的。头脑里的“私”字也是一样，不及时斗倒，日积月累，多了就会变“修”。私心杂念，尽管是一闪而过的小苗苗，也不能麻痹大意，轻易放过。要把它看成是“修”字伸进头脑里的魔爪，是滑向修正主义危险的一步。平时不狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，不彻底改造世界观，关键时刻就会当革命的逃兵。
    “私”字“一闪念”，是阶级敌人向我们灵魂深处进攻的突破口。狠抓“一闪念”，就是斗“私”的起点。要在“私”字一开始向“公”字进攻的时候，就把它消灭在前沿阵地，不让它在头脑里有一点点地盘。
    怎样才能抓住“私”字“一闪念”？脑子里要树立一个高标准，装着一面照妖镜，在“私”字一露头的时候，就能及时发现，及时揪住。这个高标准就是毛泽东思想，这个照妖镜就是“老三篇”。毛主席在“老三篇”中教导我们，要“完全”“彻底”为人民服务。
  “老三篇”的核心就是一个“公”字。张思德、白求恩是一心为公、一生为公的光辉榜样。我们学好了“老三篇”，脑子里扎下了“公”字的根，就有了是非的标准，就能用“公”字来审查自己生命的每一分钟，用毛泽东思想把“私”字消灭在萌芽状态。我在一次执行营建任务中，遇到了危险，脑子里曾经闪过害怕的念头。就在这个时候，毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，张思德的英雄形象，一下子在我的心头涌起，“公”字把“私”字顶了回去，毛泽东思想鼓舞我坚持完成了任务。收工以后，我又带着这个问题学习“老三篇”，对毛主席的教导有了更深的体会。通过这件事情，使我认识到，欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥等英雄人物，所以能在关键时刻舍生忘死，挺身而出，正是由于他们平时千百次地学习“老三篇”，用毛主席的光辉思想武装自己头脑的结果。在千钧一发的危急关头，他们头脑里闪耀的是金光闪闪的共产主义的“公”字。
    抓住了“私”字“一闪念”，并不等于就消灭了“私”字。狠抓，还要狠斗。毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”“私”字是顽固的敌人，你不进攻他，他就进攻你。狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，要发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神，打进攻战，敢于刺刀见红。“私”字“一闪念”，别人看不见，全靠自己抄家揭底。要不怕丑，不怕痛，不吞吞吐吐，不扭扭捏捏，更不能“闭门修养”。越是灵魂深处肮脏的东西，越是要暴露在群众面前，靠毛泽东思想，靠群众的批评帮助，把它彻底消灭干净。斗“私”，还要打“持久战”。阶级斗争是长期的，反映在我们头脑里的“私”字，也必然是反复出现。这个时期，在这个问题上克服了，过一个时期，在另一个问题上又会冒出来。狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，就是要时时斗，反复斗，干一辈子革命，斗一辈子“私”字。毒草锄掉可以肥田，斗一次“私”字，就能增加一分免疫力，树立一分“公”字。“私”字全斗倒，“公”字就扎根。
    狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，要上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的纲。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是最大的公，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，是最大的私。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，我们要把破私立公的斗争提高到新的水平。我们要关心国家大事，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠抓路线斗争中“私”字“一闪念”，破大私，立大公，在头脑里筑成一道“公”字的铜墙铁壁。
    能不能狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，归根结底，是对伟大领袖毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线是否忠诚的大问题。有了“私”字，脑子里有两个司令部，就不可能无限热爱毛主席，不可能树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，不可能坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。只有彻底斗倒“私”字，才能做到心里只有毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，海枯石烂志不移。
    我是一个新兵，离党和毛主席的要求还很远很远，为人民做的事情还很少很少。我决不辜负毛主席他老人家对我们青年一代的殷切期望，我要永远紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把学习毛主席著作当作生命的第一需要，读一辈子“老三篇”，斗一辈子“私”字，批一辈子修正主义，向群众学习一辈子，干一辈子革命，永远做毛主席的好战士。
