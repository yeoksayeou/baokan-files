Our great leader Chairman Mao has recently instructed us to fight self and criticize revisionism. His words have struck a chord in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the guiding principle for further promoting the revolutionization of our thoughts, carrying out the revolutionary criticism, and pushing the Cultural Revolution through to the end. It is the fundamental guarantee for ensuring that our socialist state will never change color, and it is the necessary path for advancing from socialism to communism.

We, the revolutionary masses and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, respond enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great directive of "fight self and criticize revisionism." We will carry it out with a sense of urgency, striving day and night.

We must immediately launch a campaign to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech on National Day. We will organize the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members to study in the fields, on the streets, in the brigade offices, and on the kangs. We will study earnestly and discuss repeatedly, ensuring that everyone knows and understands. When studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must better apply Chairman Mao's works, place ourselves within them, and engage in a fierce struggle against the "self" in our minds. We must overcome all non-proletarian thoughts, and make the four characters "fight self and criticize revisionism" deeply ingrained in our minds, dissolved in our blood, and reflected in our actions. We must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in the process of fighting self and criticizing revisionism.

We will take Chairman Mao's instruction of "fight self and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle to carry out the revolutionary criticism more broadly and deeply. We will use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and their agents in Nanyuan Commune. We will make the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit both magnificent and solid, thoroughly eliminating all the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism, and ensuring that great Mao Zedong Thought occupies all positions. At the same time, we will further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance in the process of fighting self and criticizing revisionism, achieve the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and vow to turn Nanyuan Commune into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    以只争朝夕精神斗私批修
    北京南苑公社贫下中农红色造反者
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们要斗私，批修。他老人家的话，说到我们贫下中农的心坎上了。这是进一步搞好思想革命化，搞好革命大批判，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的指导方针，是使我国社会主义江山永不变色的根本保证，是由社会主义走向共产主义的必由之路。
    我们无产阶级革命派和广大贫下中农，对毛主席提出的“斗私，批修”这个伟大方针，一呼百应，雷厉风行，要用“只争朝夕”的精神坚决贯彻执行。
    我们要立即掀起一个学习毛主席最新指示和林彪副主席国庆节极为重要讲话的热潮，组织贫下中农和广大社员在田间、街头、队部、炕头认真学习，反复讨论，作到家喻户晓，人人皆知。学习毛主席最新指示的时候，我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把自己摆进去，狠斗头脑里的“私”字，克服各种非无产阶级思想，把“斗私，批修”这四个字印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上。我们要在“斗私，批修”中大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    我们要以毛主席“斗私，批修”这个指示为纲，更广泛、更深入地开展革命的大批判运动，用毛泽东思想这个锐利武器狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫，狠批彭真反革命修正主义集团，狠批他们在南苑公社的代理人，把本单位的斗批改开展得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，彻底肃清反革命修正主义的一切流毒，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。同时，我们要在“斗私，批修”中，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，誓把南苑公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
