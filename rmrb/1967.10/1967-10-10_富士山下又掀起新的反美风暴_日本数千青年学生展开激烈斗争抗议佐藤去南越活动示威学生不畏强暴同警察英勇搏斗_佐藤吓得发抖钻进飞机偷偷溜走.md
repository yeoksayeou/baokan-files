Thousands of Japanese youth students have launched a fierce struggle in protest against Prime Minister Sato's activities in South Vietnam. Demonstrating students, undaunted by violence, bravely fought with the police. Sato, frightened, hurriedly boarded a plane and slipped away.

	NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) — On October 8, brave Japanese youth students at Haneda Airport in Tokyo launched an unprecedented fierce anti-American patriotic struggle in recent years, resolutely opposing Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's activities in South Vietnam and further serving the U.S. imperialist's expansion of aggression. The students, undaunted by violence, fought with fully armed reactionary police, seizing seven armored cars and setting them on fire. Haneda Airport was filled with billowing smoke and blazing flames. Many citizens, seeing the students' brave struggle, shouted, "Well done!"

	In recent times, Sato Eisaku, the loyal dog of U.S. imperialism, has been busy running around, particularly working hard to serve the U.S. and Soviet revisionists' grand conspiracy of anti-communism and anti-people in Asia and to form an anti-China encirclement. After his covert activities in South Korea and Taiwan, he has been frequently active in various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific. This time, following the orders of the U.S., he has been visiting Indonesia, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, and South Vietnam since October 8, further acting as the vanguard for U.S. aggression in Asia.

	On the morning of October 8, thousands of youth students from various parts of Japan, filled with great indignation, rushed to Haneda Airport to strongly protest against Sato's activities in South Vietnam. The Sato government mobilized thousands of armed police and plainclothes agents, hundreds of armored cars, patrol cars, and trucks to blockade all roads leading to Haneda Airport. They also placed batches of armored cars at intersections or bridgeheads to prevent students from reaching the airport.

	The enraged youth students waved red flags, shouting slogans: "Oppose Sato's activities in South Vietnam!" "Oppose U.S. aggression in Vietnam!" "U.S. imperialists, get out of Vietnam!" They picked up stones and sticks from the ground to fight with the fully armed police. The reactionary police wielded batons, brutally beating the unarmed male and female students. More than 200 students were injured, and a Kyoto student named Yamazaki Hiroaki died heroically. Faced with such brutal suppression, the students were fearless. They resolutely fought back, injuring many reactionary police. Sato Eisaku, frightened by the massive anti-American patriotic just struggle, trembled and, under police protection, sneaked through a side door into the airport and boarded a plane to flee.

	The brave struggle of Japanese youth students against Sato acting as a henchman for U.S. aggression in Vietnam is the most intense struggle since the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in 1960. It marks the new awakening of the broad masses of the Japanese people. The new fascist atrocities of the Sato reactionary government will surely spark a new storm of anti-American patriotic struggle.

	As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "The oppression inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote a broader and more intense revolution." The news of Kyoto student Yamazaki's heroic sacrifice has aroused the intense hatred of the broad masses of the Japanese people towards U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Sato government. Under the siege of armed police, the youth students who went to Haneda Airport to demonstrate held a meeting to protest and denounce the Sato government's killing of youth students. They solemnly declared that they would turn grief into strength and resolutely carry the anti-American patriotic struggle to the end.

    富士山下又掀起新的反美风暴
    日本数千青年学生展开激烈斗争抗议佐藤去南越活动
    示威学生不畏强暴同警察英勇搏斗　佐藤吓得发抖钻进飞机偷偷溜走
    新华社东京八日电　英勇的日本青年学生八日在东京羽田机场展开了几年以来空前激烈的反美爱国斗争，坚决反对日本亲美卖国首相佐藤荣作到南越去活动，进一步为美帝扩大侵略战争效劳。学生们不畏强暴，同全副武装的反动警察展开搏斗，从警察手中夺过七辆装甲车，并放火烧毁了这些用来镇压学生的装甲车。羽田机场，浓烟滚滚，火光冲天。许多市民看到学生英勇斗争的壮烈场面，高喊“干得好！”
    最近一个时期以来，美帝国主义的忠实走狗佐藤荣作上窜下跳，四出活动，特别卖力地为美帝苏修正在亚洲策划的反共反人民大阴谋和拼凑反华包围圈奔走效劳。他最近继去南朝鲜和台湾阴谋活动之后，又到亚洲太平洋地区的一些国家和地区进行一连串的频繁活动。这次，他又秉承美帝的意旨，自八日起走访印尼、新西兰、澳大利亚、菲律宾、南越，进一步充当美帝侵略亚洲的急先锋。
    八日一早，日本各地青年学生数千人，怀着极大的愤怒心情涌向东京羽田机场，强烈抗议佐藤到南越去活动。佐藤政府出动上千名武装警察和便衣特务，几百辆装甲车、警备车、卡车，封锁了通向羽田机场的所有马路，并把大批装甲车横在路口或桥头，企图阻止学生前往机场。
    被激怒的青年学生挥舞红旗，一面高呼口号：“反对佐藤去南越活动！”“反对美帝侵略越南！”“美国佬从越南滚出去！”一面从地上拾起石头和木棍同全副武装的警察展开搏斗。反动警察挥舞警棍，野蛮殴打手无寸铁的男女青年学生。二百多名学生被打伤，一位名叫山崎博昭的京都学生壮烈牺牲。学生们在残暴的镇压面前，毫不畏惧。他们坚决予以还击，打伤大批反动警察。佐藤荣作被声势浩大的反美爱国正义斗争吓得浑身发抖，只得在警察的保护下，偷偷摸摸地从一个边门里溜进机场，钻进飞机溜走。
    日本青年学生这场反对佐藤充当美帝侵略越南的帮凶的英勇斗争，是自从一九六○年日本人民反对日美“安全保障条约”斗争以来的最激烈的一次斗争，它标志着日本广大人民的新觉醒。佐藤反动政府这次新的法西斯暴行，必将激起一场新的反美爱国斗争的风暴。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”京都学生山崎壮烈牺牲的噩耗激起了日本广大人民对美帝及其走狗佐藤政府的无比仇恨。前往羽田机场示威的青年学生们在武装警察包围下举行了抗议和声讨佐藤政府杀害青年学生的大会。他们庄严表示：要化悲痛为力量，决心把反美爱国斗争坚决进行到底。
