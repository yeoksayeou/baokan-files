Military and civilians in South Vietnam's Southeast Region eliminate over 40,000 enemies in the first nine months

Including the annihilation of over 30,000 American troops and puppet soldiers; over 500 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed

New China News Agency, Hanoi, October 10th - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, preliminary statistics show that in the first nine months of this year, the military and civilians of various provinces in the Southeast Region of South Vietnam have collectively eliminated and neutralized 46,140 enemy personnel. Among them, 42,140 enemy personnel were killed, wounded, or captured (including 31,540 American troops and puppet soldiers). Sixteen American battalions and thirty-one companies, one Australian puppet company, two puppet battalions, and four companies were completely annihilated. Five hundred eighty-two enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed; 2,304 military vehicles were destroyed or damaged, including over 2,000 tanks and armored vehicles. One hundred eighty-five cannons, two radar stations, and one missile launch site were destroyed. Ninety-four million rounds of ammunition, 8,000 napalm bombs, 250 million liters of gasoline, and many warehouses and modern warfare tools of the American and puppet armies were burned.

The report states that the above-mentioned significant achievements by the military and civilians in the Southeast Region are unprecedented. Compared to the first nine months of 1966, the number of American troops eliminated has doubled, the number of military vehicles destroyed has tripled (including a fourfold increase in tanks and armored vehicles), the number of enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed has nearly tripled, and the number of cannons destroyed has increased tenfold.

During this period, the military and civilians in the Southeast Region have continuously thwarted the enemy's large-scale "sweeping" operations in provinces such as Tuyen Duc, Gia Dinh, and Xuan Loc. Among these, the largest-scale anti-"sweeping" battle took place in Xuan Loc Province from February 2nd to April 15th, eliminating 14,000 enemy personnel, the majority of whom were American troops. One hundred sixty-seven enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, over 1,000 military vehicles and over 90 cannons were destroyed, and two American infantry battalions, eighteen infantry companies, two artillery battalions, five artillery companies, and nine armored battalions were annihilated.

In addition, the Liberation Armed Forces have launched fierce attacks on the bases of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, 1st Infantry Division, 9th Infantry Division, 199th Infantry Brigade, 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 11th Independent Armored Regiment.

The rear bases of the American and puppet armies in Xuan Loc, Thuan Duc, and Dau Tieng have also been continuously attacked.

Guerrilla warfare is also flourishing. The military and civilians in Ai Tu County, Ba Dinh Province, the D War Zone near Bien Hoa Province, and the southern and northern regions of Ben Cat County, Tuyen Duc Province have actively and proactively attacked the enemy, eliminating a large number of enemy personnel.

　　南越南部东区军民头九个月歼敌四万多
　　包括歼灭美军和帮凶军三万多　击落击毁敌机五百多架
    新华社河内十日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，据不完全统计，越南南方南部东区各省军民在今年头九个月中，共消灭和瓦解敌人四万六千一百四十多名，其中打死、打伤和俘虏敌人四万二千一百四十名（包括美军和帮凶军三万一千五百四十名），全歼美军十六个营、三十一个连，澳大利亚帮凶军一个连，伪军两个营、四个连；击落、击毁敌机五百八十二架；击毁、击伤军车二千三百零四辆，其中包括坦克、装甲车二千多辆；击毁大炮一百八十五门、雷达站两个和导弹发射台一座；烧毁炮弹九十四万多发、凝固汽油弹八千颗、汽油二百五十万公升以及美伪军的许多仓库和现代化战争工具。
    报道说，南部东区军民取得的上述巨大的战果，是空前的最高纪录。同一九六六年头九个月相比，今年消灭美军的数字增加一倍，击毁军车的数字增加三倍，其中坦克、装甲车增加四倍，击落、击毁敌机的数字增加近三倍，击毁大炮的数字增加十倍。
    在上述期间，南部东区军民接连粉碎了敌人在土龙木、嘉定、西宁等省的大规模“扫荡”。其中，从二月二日到四月十五日在西宁省进行的一次反“扫荡”战斗规模最大，消灭敌人一万四千名，绝大部分是美军，击落击毁敌机一百六十七架，击毁军车一千多辆和大炮九十多门，歼灭美军两个步兵营、十八个步兵连，两个炮兵营、五个炮兵连和九个装甲营。
    此外，解放武装力量还猛烈袭击了美国第二十五步兵师、第一步兵师、第九步兵师、第一九九步兵旅、第一七三空降旅和第十一独立装甲团等的基地。
    美伪军在西宁、春禄、头顿等地的后方基地，也遭到连续的进攻。
    游击战争也日益蓬勃发展。巴地省艾交县、边和省D战区附近地区和土龙木省边葛县南部和北部地区的军民积极主动进攻敌人，消灭了敌人的大量有生力量。
