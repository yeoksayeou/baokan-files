The working people of Yugoslavia are becoming increasingly aware. The struggle of the broad masses of workers and peasants against exploitation and oppression is sweeping across the country, shaking the reactionary rule of the Tito clique.

According to materials obviously reduced in scale published in Yugoslav newspapers, over the past five years, more than 1,100 strikes have occurred across Yugoslavia. This year, strikes have become even more frequent and have spread throughout the country. An article in the August 21 issue of *Political Express* worriedly stated: "The recent stoppages have attracted particular attention, largely because they have occurred in a relatively short period of time across the country."

The "economic reforms" that the Tito clique has been vigorously promoting nationwide, which further capitalistize and colonize Yugoslavia, have made the country's economy even more seriously deteriorate. Many factories have halted production, products are piling up, and losses are severe. In order to escape the increasingly dire situation, factory management has resorted to all means to cut into workers' wages, arbitrarily and unreasonably reducing or withholding workers' wages, and even mass layoffs, making workers increasingly impoverished.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance; where there is exploitation, there is struggle. This year, the scale of workers' strikes has been increasing. At the end of August, more than 200 workers at the Moravica Textile Factory collectively went on strike to protest the factory's unreasonable withholding of wages. Eight hundred workers at the Durro Jakovic Carriage Factory went on strike to protest the factory's long-term reduction of wages. Workers at the Tobu Factory formed a "strike committee" to lead the strike before going on strike. Workers in the textile and garment departments of the Otocenike Factory went on strike in July and August, demanding the replacement of the factory's technical manager.

Workers in some factories have also taken to the streets, holding up banners that read "We demand jobs," "We demand self-management rights," "Down with the management committee," and holding demonstrations.

Some factory workers not only raised clear political slogans but also took drastic actions. The leadership of the Nis Transportation Company, in order to solve the "difficulties" caused by losses, reduced workers' wages. This serious act of exploitation aroused strong indignation among the workers. On July 25, the workers acted in unison, refusing to accept the reduced wages. Twenty-one workers angrily rushed into the general manager's office, dragging this henchman of the Tito regime out of the office and throwing him from inside the wall to the street outside. Later, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia organization in the company planned to "trial" the so-called troublemaking workers. Under the resistance of most League of Communists of Yugoslavia members, the plot to "trial" the workers did not succeed. This incident shocked the Tito regime. In early August, the Nis District Council had to announce the implementation of "compulsory management" over this enterprise.

In various rural areas of Yugoslavia, laboring peasants have also risen up to resist taxes and levies, opposing the Tito clique's "state farms" seizing farmers' land and forcibly diverting rivers. On August 17, more than 200 farmers in Trstenik collectively went to Belgrade to protest the Tito clique's annual extortion of various oppressive taxes from farmers. The farmers there, in order to survive, rebelled on the farms, overturned the farm's trucks, and smashed the farm's machinery. They angrily said: "Even if we are torn to pieces, we will never allow the river to be diverted."

The struggle of the Yugoslav working people against exploitation and oppression has made the Tito clique anxious. In order to maintain its extremely unstable reactionary rule, the Tito clique is further strengthening its fascist dictatorship over the broad masses of working people. In March of this year, Tito personally took the stage, shouting about how "we have been too liberalized" and that we need to "strengthen discipline." The power organs of Yugoslavia, following the instructions of their leader Tito, have strengthened suppression measures, disciplining or arresting League of Communists of Yugoslavia members who participate in strikes, and even more severely punishing ordinary workers. The Nis District Court recently sentenced eight workers who participated in the struggle against the general manager of the Nis Transportation Company to six months to two years in prison. The Tito clique's brutal persecution of the Yugoslav working people will surely provoke even more intense resistance, and history will pronounce its complete annihilation.

    南斯拉夫劳动人民正在进一步觉醒
    工人农民反剥削反压迫斗争怒潮遍及全国
    工人罢工规模越来越大，并举行示威游行，提出鲜明政治口号，采取剧烈行动；劳动农民也相继抗捐抗税；工农的斗争冲击着铁托集团的反动统治
    据新华社二十八日讯  贝尔格莱德消息：深受铁托叛徒集团残酷剥削和压迫的南斯拉夫劳动人民，正在进一步觉醒。广大工人、农民为维护基本权利和反对剥削、反对压迫的斗争怒潮遍及全国，冲击着铁托集团的反动统治。
    据南斯拉夫报刊透露的显然缩小了的材料，近五年来，在南斯拉夫全国就发生一千一百多次工人罢工事件。今年以来，罢工事件更加频繁，而且遍及全国各地。《政治快报》八月二十一日的一篇文章忧心忡忡地说：“最近的停工事件之所以引起人们的格外注意，很大一部分原因是，它们在比较短暂的时间内发生在全国各地。”
    铁托集团在全国竭力推行的、使南斯拉夫进一步资本主义化和殖民地化的“经济改革”，使得南斯拉夫的经济进一步严重恶化。很多工厂生产停滞，产品积压，亏损严重。厂方为了摆脱日益严重的困境，不择手段地向工人开刀，他们任意无理降低或扣发工人的工资，甚至大批地解雇工人，使工人越来越贫困。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗；那里有剥削，那里就有斗争。今年以来，工人罢工规模越来越大。八月底，莫拉维察纺织厂共有二百多名工人集体罢工，抗议厂方无理扣发工资。久罗·贾科维奇车厢制造厂八百名工人罢工，抗议厂方长期减发工资。托布工厂的工人在举行罢工以前，还成立了“罢工委员会”，指挥罢工。奥托谦凯工厂纺织和成衣车间的工人在今年七、八两个月中接连罢工，要求撤换工厂的技术经理。
    一些工厂的工人还纷纷走上街头，高举“我们要求工作”，“我们要求自治权”，“打倒管理委员会”等标语牌，举行游行示威。
    有的工厂的工人，不仅提出鲜明的政治口号，并且采取了剧烈的行动。尼什交通运输公司的领导为了解决由于亏损所造成的“困难”，少发工人的工资。这种严重的剥削行径引起了广大工人的强烈不满。七月二十五日，工人们一致行动，拒绝接受减少了的工资。二十一名工人愤怒地闯进总经理办公室，把这个铁托统治集团的爪牙拖出办公室，并从围墙内把他扔到墙外的大街上。此后，这家公司的南共联盟组织策划“审判”所谓闹事的工人。在大部分南共联盟盟员的抵制下，“审判”工人的阴谋未能得逞。这一事件使铁托统治集团大为震惊。八月上旬，尼什区议会不得不宣布对这家企业实行“强制性管理”。
    南斯拉夫各地农村，劳动农民也相继奋起抗捐抗税，反对铁托集团的“国营农场”兼并农民的土地、强行截断河流等暴行。八月十七日，特尔斯台尼奇卡的二百多名农民集体前往贝尔格莱德，抗议铁托集团每年向农民勒索各种苛捐杂税。那里的农民为求生存，到农场造反，推翻了农场的汽车，砸烂农场的机器。他们愤怒地说：“就是粉身碎骨，也决不容许截断河流。”
    南斯拉夫劳动人民反剥削、反压迫的斗争使得铁托集团惊慌不安。为了维持其极不稳定的反动统治，铁托集团正在进一步加强对广大劳动人民的法西斯专政。今年三月份，铁托亲自出马，叫嚷什么“我们过分自由化了”，要
  “加强纪律”。南斯拉夫的政权机构秉承其头目铁托的旨意，加强了镇压措施，对参加罢工的南共联盟盟员轻者予以纪律制裁，重者要逮捕法办。对一般工人更是要严办。尼什区法院最近分别判处参加揪斗尼什交通运输公司总经理的八名工人以六个月到两年的徒刑。铁托集团对南斯拉夫劳动人民的残酷迫害，必将激起更加剧烈的反抗，历史将宣判它的彻底灭亡。
