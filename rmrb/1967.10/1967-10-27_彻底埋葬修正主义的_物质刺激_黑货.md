Editor's Note: Here we reprint a big-character poster from the Yangshupu Power Plant in Shanghai, written by revolutionary workers on the front lines of production. These revolutionary big-character posters have a vivid, sharp, and combative style, like bombs hitting the enemy's vital points. They eloquently demonstrate that workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are outstanding revolutionary critics.

These posters reflect the revolutionary workers of the Yangshupu Power Plant following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, taking "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the key link, with everyone participating in the battle and wielding their pens, launching a new high tide of mass revolutionary criticism.

To truly overthrow and expose the revisionist clique within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, we must fully mobilize the masses and wage a people's war of revolutionary criticism. Such criticism must be combined with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the local area and unit to more broadly mobilize and attract the masses to participate, fully utilizing the wisdom and strength of the masses to thoroughly expose and criticize the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev. Such criticism is both a good battlefield for "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" and a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The comrades at the Yangshupu Power Plant have done this, and thus achieved good results.

Burying the Revisionist "Material Incentives" Trash

Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul, and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Socialist construction relies on the revolutionization of people's thinking, placing the revolutionization of people at the forefront, and using the revolutionization of people to drive mechanization.

The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed Chairman Mao's teachings. He vigorously advocates for "material first," "bonuses first," claiming that to achieve industrialization, one must "manage the economy with economic methods," and only by promoting material incentives and bonus leadership can one mobilize production enthusiasm.

A small clique of capitalism-roaders within the power system has followed their black master, the Chinese Khrushchev, and stirred up a counter-revolutionary revisionist gale within the power system. As early as 1954, our plant was the first to implement the revisionist "safety no-accident bonus system" in the national power system. In 1958, under the brilliant banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we workers rose up to rebel against the small clique of capitalism-roaders in power, and swept away this revisionist system. However, during the period of temporary economic difficulties, under the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, the small clique of capitalism-roaders within our plant threw out this "soft knife" that kills without bloodshed, and vigorously advocated that "material incentives can mobilize people's enthusiasm!" We ask: what kind of enthusiasm does it mobilize?

We believe that so-called "enthusiasm" ultimately has only two kinds: one is the enthusiasm to wholeheartedly serve the people, to strive for the socialist revolution and socialist construction cause, as Chairman Mao teaches: "The masses harbor a great socialist enthusiasm." This selfless enthusiasm is excellent! It should be vigorously promoted and greatly carried forward. The other is the enthusiasm for personal gain and selfishness, that is, the capitalist "enthusiasm." This "enthusiasm" must be severely criticized and resolutely resisted. "Material incentives" are the poison that stimulates this individualistic "enthusiasm," it will corrupt our workers' revolutionary will, allowing those bosses to comfortably carry out capitalist restoration.

The bosses who advocate "material incentives" say: "Material incentives embody the principle of distribution according to work, overcoming egalitarianism." This is all deceitful talk. In essence, it is using the banner of distribution according to work to commit revisionist evil deeds. Just look at the bonus rates of various personnel in the "safety no-accident bonus system": the wages of ordinary workers are low, and their bonus rate is only 15 to 20 percent of their own wages, while some engineers, workshop directors, and chief operators, whose original wages are already high, have a bonus rate reaching 45 to 50 percent of their own wages. Some people's monthly bonus is even higher than a master worker's monthly wage. What distribution principle is this? Isn't this a thorough revisionist trash?

"With a golden cudgel, the Monkey King rises to sweep away the dust of the universe." In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly criticize and expose the small clique of capitalism-roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and cleanse their poison in all aspects, burying the revisionist "material incentives" trash!

### 彻底埋葬修正主义的“物质刺激”黑货

专栏：

    编者按：这里选刊的上海杨树浦发电厂的革命大字报，出自战斗在生产第一线的革命职工之手。这些革命大字报，具有鲜明生动、尖锐泼辣的战斗风格，象一颗颗炮弹一样，打中敌人的要害。它雄辩地说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，是出色的革命批判家。
    这些大字报，反映了杨树浦发电厂的革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，人人参战，个个挥笔，掀起了群众性革命大批判的新高潮。
    要真正从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就必须充分发动群众，打一场革命大批判的“人民战争”。这种大批判，也只有同本地区、本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，才能更广泛地动员和吸引群众参加，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量，把中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒揭深批透。这样的大批判，既是“斗私，批修”的好战场，又是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。杨树浦发电厂的同志们这样做了，所以取得了良好效果。
    彻底埋葬修正主义的“物质刺激”黑货
    毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”社会主义建设，靠人的思想革命化，要把人的革命化放在首位，用人的革命化带动机械化。
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯同毛主席的教导唱对台戏。他竭力鼓吹“物质第一”，“奖金第一”，说什么要实现工业化，只有“按经济办法管理经济”，只有大搞物质刺激，奖金挂帅，才能调动生产积极性。
    电业系统党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，紧跟其黑主子中国赫鲁晓夫，在电业系统中刮起了一股反革命修正主义妖风。早在一九五四年，在全国电业系统中我厂就首先推行了修正主义的“安全无事故奖金制度”。一九五八年，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，我们工人起来造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，把这种修正主义的制度冲掉了。可是，到了三年经济暂时困难时期，我厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，又把这杀人不见血的“软刀子”抛了出来，并且大肆鼓吹什么“物质刺激能调动人的积极性”！请问：它调动的到底是什么样的积极性？
    我们认为，所谓“积极性”，归根结底只有两种：一种是全心全意为人民服务、为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业而奋发图强的积极性。正如毛主席所教导的那样：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”这种一心为公的积极性，好得很！应该大力提倡，大大发扬。另一种则是为个人名利、一心为“私”的个人主义的“积极性”，也就是资本主义的“积极性”。这种“积极性”，必须严加批判，坚决抵制。“物质刺激”就是刺激这种个人主义“积极性”的毒药，它会腐蚀我们工人的革命意志，好让那班老爷舒舒服服地搞资本主义复辟。
    提倡“物质刺激”的老爷们说：“物质刺激体现了按劳分配的原则，克服了平均主义。”这完全是骗人的鬼话。说穿了，是挂着按劳分配的旗号，干着修正主义的罪恶勾当。就拿“安全无事故奖金制度”中各类人员的奖金率来看：一般工人工资低，奖金率只有本人工资的百分之十五到二十，而一些工程师、车间主任、总值长等人，原来工资就很高，但他们的奖金率要达到本人工资的百分之四十五到五十。有些人一个月的奖金竟比老师傅一个月的工资还高。这是什么分配原则？这不是彻头彻尾的修正主义黑货又是什么？
      “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要彻底批倒、批臭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，肃清他们在各方面的流毒，把修正主义的“物质刺激”黑货彻底埋葬！
