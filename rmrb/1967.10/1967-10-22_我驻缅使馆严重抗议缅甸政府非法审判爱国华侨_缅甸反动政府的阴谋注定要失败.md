	The Chinese Embassy in Burma severely protests the Burmese reactionary government's illegal trial of innocent patriotic overseas Chinese. The embassy's note pointed out that this is a political conspiracy by the Burmese reactionary government to shift the blame for its own orchestrated anti-China, anti-Chinese fascist atrocities.

	The Chinese Embassy once again sternly demands that the Burmese government immediately release the innocent detained overseas Chinese and immediately stop the political persecution of overseas Chinese students, parents, and leaders.

	The note pointed out: Overseas Chinese students love their own country and their great leader Chairman Mao. Wearing Chairman Mao's badge is their sacred and inviolable right. The overseas Chinese students Yang Derong, Jiang Rulin, Li Shaoxing, and Li Panhua, parents, and leaders Yang Laoqing, Chen Bofu, Huang Zhongquan, Ruan Yongtang, Lin Chenglong, Wen Ping, Chen Tianhuang, Wang Sixia, and Wang Lianfa, who were illegally arrested by the Burmese reactionary government, are completely innocent. The Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy have repeatedly demanded that the Burmese government immediately release the innocent detained overseas Chinese. However, the Burmese government not only has not done so but now has falsely accused the detained overseas Chinese students, parents, and leaders and is holding a trial, which further exposes the Burmese reactionary government's deliberate political persecution of overseas Chinese and is another serious step in the Burmese reactionary government's anti-China, anti-Chinese campaign.

	The note continued: It is well known that the Burmese reactionary government organized mobs to carry out horrifying massacres and looting of overseas Chinese, and imprisoned many innocent patriotic overseas Chinese, subjecting them to illegal interrogations. To this day, they are still suffering in dire straits, while the real culprits are free. The murderers of Chinese expert Liu Yi, who aided Burma, have not yet received the punishment they deserve; the trial of the thugs who stabbed the Chinese diplomatic courier was a sham. The real criminals who committed arson and heinous crimes have not received the punishment they deserve, while the innocent detained patriotic overseas Chinese students, parents, and leaders have become the targets of the trial. This is truly a case of turning black into white and confusing right and wrong.

	The note pointed out: The despicable acts of the Burmese reactionary government will certainly arouse even greater indignation among the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese and students, and will inevitably face opposition from the broad masses of the Burmese people. The trial conspiracy played by the Burmese reactionary government is doomed to fail.

    我驻缅使馆严重抗议缅甸政府非法审判爱国华侨
    缅甸反动政府的阴谋注定要失败
    新华社二十日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十九日照会缅甸外交部，严重抗议缅甸反动政府非法审判无辜被捕爱国华侨。照会指出，这是缅甸反动政府妄图推掉它一手策划的反华排华法西斯暴行的严重罪责的一个政治阴谋。
    中国大使馆再次严正要求缅甸政府，必须立即释放无辜被捕的华侨，立即停止对华侨学生、家长、侨领的政治迫害。
    照会指出：华侨学生热爱自己的祖国，热爱自己的伟大领袖毛主席，佩戴毛主席像章，这是他们神圣不可侵犯的权利。被缅甸反动政府非法逮捕的华侨学生杨德荣、江儒林、李绍兴、李泮华，家长和侨领杨老清、陈伯甫、黄忠泉、阮咏棠、林成隆、温平、陈天煌、王思华、王连发等，是完全无罪的。中国政府和中国大使馆曾多次要求缅甸政府立即释放无辜被捕的华侨，然而，缅甸政府非但没有这样做，现在竟然对被捕的华侨学生、家长、侨领加上莫须有的罪名，开庭审判，这就进一步暴露了缅甸反动政府蓄意对华侨进行政治迫害，也是缅甸反动政府反华排华的又一严重步骤。
    照会接着说：众所周知，是缅甸反动政府组织暴徒对华侨实行了骇人听闻的屠杀和洗劫，并且把许多无辜的爱国华侨关进监牢，进行非法审讯，至今他们仍处在水深火热之中，而真正的罪魁祸首却逍遥法外。杀害中国援缅专家刘逸同志的凶手，至今没有得到应有的惩罚；对刺伤中国外交信使的暴徒，你们则安排了一个假审判。真正杀人放火、罪恶滔天的罪犯没有受到应有的惩罚，而无辜被捕的爱国华侨学生、家长、侨领却成了审判的对象，这真是颠倒黑白，混淆是非。
    照会指出：缅甸反动政府的卑鄙行径，必将激起广大爱国华侨和学生的更大的愤慨，同时也必然要遭到缅甸广大人民的反对。缅甸反动政府玩弄的这个审判阴谋是注定要失败的。
