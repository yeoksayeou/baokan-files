As early as 1921, the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, achieved victory in the democratic revolution and established their own government. However, since the Zedenbal clique seized the leadership of the Mongolian Party and state, this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, following the Soviet revisionists, betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the socialist cause fought for by the Mongolian people, and pushed a socialist country into the abyss of colonialism. This painful lesson is deeply thought-provoking!

However, the Soviet revisionist clique and the Mongolian revisionist clique actually boast about their shame as if it were an honor. They turned Mongolia into a Soviet colony, plunging it into a miserable state of retrogression and bankruptcy, and still have the audacity to peddle their so-called "non-capitalist development path" to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They claim to have set an example for the progress and development of colonial and semi-colonial countries and newly independent nations, and to be the model for backward colonial countries and newly independent nations.

So, what is this "non-capitalist development path" that the Soviet and Mongolian revisionists boast about? According to their claims, this "path" is: as long as the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America rely on Soviet "aid," they can peacefully enter socialism.

What nonsense! This not only has nothing to do with Marxism-Leninism but is also completely at odds with objective reality.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without a thorough democratic revolution led by the Communist Party, it is impossible to build a socialist society on the ruins of colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries; that is sheer fantasy."

The Mongolian revisionist clique and their Soviet masters peddle the idea that relying on "Soviet aid" can lead to a "non-capitalist development path." In essence, this is just a variant of the revisionist theory of "peaceful transition."

The Soviet and Mongolian revisionists boldly claim that their theory is based on Lenin's teachings. No, this is a desecration of the great Lenin!

It is true that Lenin analyzed the new historical conditions for the struggle for liberation by backward countries after the October Revolution. He pointed out at the time: if the victorious proletariat systematically propagandizes and if the Soviet governments of various countries provide assistance to the best of their abilities, under such conditions, as long as the proletariat and its party firmly grasp the leadership of the democratic revolution and lead the national democratic revolution to complete victory, then backward countries can transition to the Soviet system without going through the capitalist development stage, and then, after a certain stage of development, transition to communism.

Lenin's meaning is very clear. He regarded the propaganda and assistance of the victorious proletariat and the Soviet governments of various countries as favorable external conditions for backward countries to achieve victory in the national democratic revolution and skip the capitalist development stage. He never said that the proletariat and its party in these countries could therefore relinquish the leadership of the revolution, or that they could relinquish the revolutionary struggle of their people, including armed struggle. On the contrary, it was the great Lenin who repeatedly emphasized that the proletariat and its party in these countries must firmly grasp the leadership of the national democratic revolution, seize power, smash the old state machine, and establish a new government. It was the great Lenin who repeatedly pointed out that the liberation movement and liberation war of oppressed nations are inevitable, progressive, and revolutionary.

However, the Soviet and Mongolian revisionists shamelessly castrate the revolutionary soul of Lenin's teachings, distorting Lenin's theory that backward countries can transition to socialism without going through the capitalist development stage into the fallacy of "peaceful transition." They deliberately blur the class boundaries between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, confuse the two different stages of national democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and advocate the idea that socialism can be achieved without the proletariat and without a truly revolutionary party armed with the advanced ideology of the proletariat. They claim that "newly emerging young nationalist countries, under the support of their democratic governments, can completely choose to follow the non-capitalist development path." Their goal is to make the proletariat parties and the broad revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America relinquish the leadership of the revolution, give up armed struggle, become appendages and tail of the bourgeoisie, and be manipulated by the bourgeoisie governments. Their goal is to whitewash the reactionary rule of the Indian Congress Party government, the military dictatorship of Ne Win in Burma, and other lackeys of imperialism, to give their reactionary rule a "socialist" color, and to help them suppress the armed struggle of the revolutionary people.

In short, they want to bring the burgeoning national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America onto the revisionist track and help imperialism extinguish the flames of revolution.

The Mongolian revisionist clique not only vigorously promotes the fallacy of "peaceful transition" but also actively spreads illusions about Soviet aid, helping the Soviet revisionists peddle neo-colonialism. They claim: "In the present era, the development of any country does not depend on its own level of development but relies on the support and aid of socialist countries to follow the socialist path." They praise the Soviet revisionists as "reliable pillars for the people of all countries in their struggle for social and national liberation." They shamelessly boast that "Mongol-Soviet cooperation will become a model for the people of newly emerging countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to build a new life."

Enough! Is the fact that Mongolia has become a colony by relying on Soviet "aid" not enough to reveal the truth? Look at modern world history: has any colony achieved liberation and development solely by relying on foreign aid? Has any country achieved socialism without relying on the hard struggle of its own people but solely on foreign aid? No, not one! Instead, there is Yugoslavia, which relied on "American aid" to build "socialism" and ended up as a puppet and counter-revolutionary mercenary of American imperialism; and there is Mongolia, which relied on "Soviet aid" to build "socialism" and ended up as a colony of the Soviet revisionists. The facts prove that Soviet "aid" and American "aid" are of the same kind, both are bait to lure fish, and both are tools of neo-colonialism.

Chairman Mao said: "Our policy should be based on what? On the basis of our own strength, which is called self-reliance." He also said: "The struggle for complete liberation by oppressed peoples is first and foremost dependent on their own efforts, and only then on international aid." Only by relying on self-reliance can one stand unshakable in any situation.

The issue is clear: the Mongolian revisionist clique is so eager to peddle the so-called "non-capitalist development path" for the Soviet revisionists precisely to resist the great influence of the Chinese revolutionary path on the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and to help American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique sabotage the national liberation movement. They themselves do not revolutionize, and they also try to prevent the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America from revolutionizing. Under the rule of the Mongolian revisionist clique, the path of degeneration, retrogression, and national humiliation that Mongolia has taken is not a "model" or "example" at all, but an excellent negative example for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Contrary to the wishes of the Mongolian revisionist clique and their masters, the broad revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, through their own struggles, increasingly deeply understand that the path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power by armed force, as pointed out by Chairman Mao, is the only correct and brilliant path for the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations to achieve revolutionary victory. They are determined to take up arms, rely on their own strength, wage a people's war, and thoroughly bury imperialism, old and new colonialism, and all their running dogs, and build a bright red new world.

　　亚非拉各国人民的反面教员
　　内蒙古大学井冈山兵团　内蒙古党委机关红旗联络总部
    早在一九二一年，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，取得了民主革命的胜利，建立了自己的政权。可是，自从泽登巴尔集团篡夺了蒙古党和国家的领导权之后，这一批反革命修正主义分子，追随苏修集团，背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了蒙古人民艰苦奋斗所开创的社会主义事业，把一个社会主义国家推进殖民地的深渊。这个沉痛的教训，是多么令人深思啊！
    然而，苏修集团和蒙修集团竟把耻辱当作光荣来夸耀，他们自己把蒙古变成了苏修的殖民地，使蒙古陷于倒退破产的悲惨境地还不算，还要厚着脸皮向亚非拉各国人民兜售他们的所谓“非资本主义发展的道路”，他们标榜自己“对殖民地附属国和年轻国家的进步和发展作出了典范”，“是落后的殖民地国家及刚获得独立的国家的榜样”。
    那么，苏修和蒙修集团所吹嘘的这条“非资本主义发展的道路”究竟是怎样一条道路呢？按照他们的说法，这条“道路”就是：亚非拉各国只要依靠苏修的“援助”，就可以沿着“非资本主义发展的道路”和平地进入社会主义。
    真是海外奇谈！这不但没有丝毫马克思列宁主义的气味，而且同客观现实相距十万八千里。
    毛主席教导我们说，“没有一个由共产党领导的新式的资产阶级性质的彻底的民主革命，要想在殖民地半殖民地半封建的废墟上建立起社会主义社会来，那只是完全的空想。”
    蒙修集团及其苏修主子向亚非拉各国兜售什么依靠“苏援”就可以走上“非资本主义发展的道路”的黑货，说穿了，不过是“和平过渡”的修正主义理论的变种而已。
    苏修和蒙修集团却大言不惭地说，他们的这一套是列宁的教导。不，这是对伟大列宁的亵渎！
    不错，列宁曾经分析了十月革命后落后国家争取解放斗争的新的历史条件。他当时指出：如果革命胜利了的无产阶级对他们进行系统的宣传，各国苏维埃政府尽自己的能力给予他们帮助，在这样的条件下，只要无产阶级及其政党紧紧掌握民主革命的领导权，把民族民主革命引向彻底胜利，那末，落后国家就可以不经过资本主义发展阶段而过渡到苏维埃制度，然后经过一定发展阶段过渡到共产主义。
    列宁的意思是很清楚的，他把胜利了的无产阶级和各国苏维埃政府的宣传和帮助，只看作是落后国家取得民族民主革命胜利和越过资本主义发展阶段的有利的外部条件。他从来没有说过，这些国家的无产阶级及其政党因此可以放弃革命的领导权，因此可以放弃本国人民包括武装斗争在内的革命斗争。恰恰相反，正是伟大的列宁反复强调，这些国家的无产阶级及其政党必须紧紧掌握民族民主革命的领导权，夺取政权，打碎旧的国家机器，建立新政权。正是伟大的列宁多次指出，被压迫民族的解放运动和解放战争是不可避免的、进步的、革命的。
    而苏修和蒙修集团却无耻地阉割列宁学说的革命灵魂，把列宁关于落后国家可以不经过资本主义发展阶段而过渡到社会主义的理论歪曲成“和平过渡”的谬论。他们故意抹杀无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级界限，混淆民族民主革命和社会主义革命两个不同的阶段，宣扬没有无产阶级、没有以无产阶级先进思想武装起来的真正革命政党就能实行社会主义的论调，说什么“新兴的年轻的民族主义国家，在其民主政权的支持下完全可以选定走非资本主义发展的道路”。他们的目的就是要使亚非拉各国的无产阶级政党和广大革命人民放弃革命的领导权，放弃武装斗争，去充当资产阶级的附庸和尾巴，去听任资产阶级政府的摆布。他们的目的就是要为印度的国大党政府、缅甸的奈温军人独裁政权那样的帝国主义的走狗涂脂抹粉，为他们的反动统治涂上“社会主义”的色彩，帮助他们镇压革命人民的武装斗争。
    总之，他们就是要把亚非拉蓬勃开展的民族解放运动纳入修正主义的轨道，帮助帝国主义扑灭革命的烈火。
    蒙修集团不但大肆宣扬“和平过渡”的谬论，而且竭力散布对苏修援助的幻想，帮助苏修推销新殖民主义。他们声称：“现时代任何一个国家的发展，不取决于本国的发展水平，而是依靠社会主义国家的支持与援助走向社会主义道路”。他们吹捧苏修是“各国人民在争取社会解放和民族解放斗争中的可靠支柱”。他们还无耻地大肆吹嘘“蒙苏合作，将成为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲新兴国家人民建设新生活的典范”。
    够了，难道蒙古依赖苏“援”变成殖民地的事实还不足以说明问题的实质吗？打开近代世界史看一看，有哪一个殖民地仅仅依靠外国的援助获得了解放和发展？有哪一个国家不依靠本国人民的艰苦奋斗而仅仅依靠外国的援助走向了社会主义的道路？没有，一个也没有！有的倒是依靠美“援”来建设“社会主义”，结果变成了美帝国主义的附庸和反革命别动队的南斯拉夫；有的倒是依靠苏“援”来建设“社会主义”，结果变成了苏修的殖民地的蒙古。事实证明，苏“援”和美“援”是一路货，都是引鱼上钩的钓饵，都是新殖民主义的工具。
    毛主席说：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”又说：“被压迫人民争取彻底的解放，首先是依靠自己的斗争，其次才是国际的援助。”只有依靠自力更生，才能在任何情况下都立于不败之地。
    问题是很清楚的，蒙修集团如此卖力地为苏修兜售所谓“非资本主义发展的道路”，就是为了抵制中国革命的道路对亚非拉各国人民的巨大影响，就是为了帮助美帝国主义和苏修集团破坏民族解放运动。他们自己不革命，也企图阻止亚非拉各国人民革命。在蒙修集团统治下，蒙古所走的蜕化倒退、丧权辱国的道路，绝不是什么“典范”和“榜样”，而是亚非拉各国人民绝妙的反面教员。
    与蒙修集团及其主子的愿望相反，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大革命人民，从自己的斗争实践中，日益深刻地认识到毛主席所指出的农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路，是无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族取得革命胜利的唯一正确的光辉道路。他们决心拿起武器，依靠自己的力量，打一场人民战争，彻底埋葬帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其一切走狗，打出一个红彤彤的新世界来。
