The Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently decided that most of its members should go deep into the grassroots, learn from the masses, and together with the masses, study and implement Chairman Mao's latest directive on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After receiving the latest directives from our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee immediately convened a meeting of its Standing Committee for repeated and serious study and discussion. Everyone expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's latest battle call, resolve to go among the masses immediately, organize the masses to seriously study, deeply understand, and firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest directives. They decided that, except for leaving one-fifth of the members to handle daily work, the rest of the members should go deep into factories, rural areas, and schools; some members should be responsible for running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The members going to the grassroots should learn from the masses, be humble students of the masses, and together with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, work and fight together, and implement Chairman Mao's latest directives. Using Chairman Mao's latest directives as a weapon, they should jointly summarize the experiences and lessons from the previous stage of the Cultural Revolution, formulate specific measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key task, carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Vice Chairman Han Jinhai of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and other comrades immediately went to factories and schools after the meeting. Chairman Wang Xiaoyu will also lead a group of comrades to go among the masses.

The decision of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a major revolutionary measure to correctly handle the relationships between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The implementation of this measure will greatly promote the thought revolutionization of cadres and the revolutionization of office work.
