Guinea's Chargé d'Affaires, Kamara, held a reception today to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the Republic of Guinea's independence. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo attended the reception.

Kamara, the Chargé d'Affaires, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian both spoke at the reception.

Kamara, the Chargé d'Affaires, enthusiastically praised the friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea and warmly applauded China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that the Cultural Revolution is a direct and powerful contribution to the struggles of the oppressed peoples.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, in his speech, pointed out that the Chinese people must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Through this Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people, together with the peoples of Africa and the world, will unite more closely in the common cause of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.

Kamara, the Chargé d'Affaires, spoke first at the reception. He introduced Guinea's achievements in maintaining national independence and economic construction. He said, "We know that the more we advance, the more difficulties we will encounter. However, we will rely on our own efforts and, as Chairman Mao said, 'Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory.'"

Kamara condemned imperialist aggression against various countries. He said, "Where there is oppression, there is resistance. We believe that the peoples of various countries will raise their consciousness and strike at the common enemy."

The Chargé d'Affaires expressed that Guinea firmly supports the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the African peoples and the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people, and exposes the aggressive crimes of American and British imperialism in the Middle East.

Kamara enthusiastically praised the friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea. He said, "The friendly relations between our two countries are continuously developing, and the Guinean people are extremely pleased about this. He said, "This great country of China has always treated Guinea with the greatest respect, understanding, and brotherly affection. He thanked China for sending experts to aid Guinea and quoted President Sekou Toure's words, saying that the technical personnel sent by the Chinese people have taught us humility, self-confidence, bravery in work, self-sacrifice, and a simple way of life through their example, which is undoubtedly the most precious wealth given to our country. He said, "On this occasion, we express our heartfelt thanks to the great Chinese people led by the Communist Party of China and the great and beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong."

The Chargé d'Affaires said, "The victory of the Chinese people is our victory, the victory of all anti-imperialist forces in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We are particularly pleased to see the achievements made by China since the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched and led by Chairman Mao Zedong in various aspects. These achievements sharply refute the lies fabricated by the imperialists and reactionaries in their newspapers in collusion with each other. What we see is that the greater the achievements of the Cultural Revolution, the more the People's Republic of China strengthens its support for newly liberated or progressive countries that are engaged in anti-imperialist struggles. Under these circumstances, wishing the Cultural Revolution greater achievements is our revolutionary duty."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian praised the Guinean people for their courageous struggle in maintaining national independence and defending national sovereignty, which has thwarted the various subversive and interfering attempts by imperialism and its lackeys. He said, "The Chinese people are happy with the victories achieved by the Guinean people in their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles and in building their own country, and we wish the Guinean people continuous new victories."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, when talking about the current good situation in the world, said, "The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people is advancing, and the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world for liberation is developing. The counterattacks by the doomed imperialism can only promote greater awareness and greater resistance among the peoples of the world. The Chinese people are fully convinced that the African people, who insist on unity and struggle, will surely achieve the final victory over imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian thanked the Guinean people for their high evaluation and support of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He condemned the imperialists and modern revisionists for their slander, defamation, and attacks on our Cultural Revolution, and condemned the imperialists and modern revisionists for launching a new wave of anti-China reversals. He emphasized, "The Chinese people must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and we are firmly convinced that, through this Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people, together with the African people and the peoples of the world, will better carry out the common struggle in the common cause of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle."

When talking about the friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea, Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, "We believe that aid is mutual. Our aid to Guinea is our internationalist duty; the anti-imperialist struggle of the Guinean people is also the best support for us."

The Tanzanian Republic's Minister of Land, Settlement, and Water Development, Babu, and the Tanzanian Friendship Delegation he led, who are currently visiting our country, the Director of the Office of the President of Mali, Bakara Diallo, and his wife, and members of the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Revolutionary Movement and Government Delegation were invited to attend the reception.

Those who attended the reception also included officials from relevant departments of our government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Ambassadors from various countries to China attended the reception.
