The revolutionary mass organizations of the Inner Mongolia Agricultural College achieved a revolutionary great union in April this year. They have since placed great emphasis on consolidating the unity of the leadership core, eliminating any factors that could lead to splits within the revolutionary faction at their inception. They have followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, continually overcoming various petty-bourgeois thoughts. After more than half a year of effort, they have united more than 95% of the cadres and masses, consolidated and developed the revolutionary great union, and promoted the revolutionary great criticism. Recently, the entire school has launched a "criticize revisionism and repudiate selfishness" campaign in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, determined to turn the Agricultural College into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

After achieving the revolutionary great union, the main contradiction facing the revolutionary faction at the Agricultural College was still the one between the proletariat and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. However, they also faced various contradictions among the people, such as those within the revolutionary faction, between the revolutionary faction and the misled masses, and between the revolutionary faction and erring cadres. These contradictions inevitably reflected and concentrated in the leadership core of the revolutionary faction. In this situation, the unity of the leadership core was of decisive significance. If the leading cadres could unify their thoughts on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and correctly handle various contradictions within the leadership core, it would be beneficial to handle the contradictions within the revolutionary faction. This would enable the entire college's revolutionary faction to unify their thoughts and actions, overcome contradictions, and move forward continuously.

The Agricultural College experienced an incident where, in late July, some class combat teams believed that the school revolutionary faction's general service station was not vigorously promoting the great criticism and wanted to establish another great criticism liaison station. This issue caused a split in opinions within the general service station. Some said that the combat team was trying to cause a split, while others thought that this view was incorrect because the direction of the great criticism was correct. Two opposing views quickly formed among the masses, with big-character posters flying everywhere, and the situation became quite tense. To address this, the leadership of the general service station decided to conduct a rectification campaign, hold debates, and ultimately unify their understanding. They affirmed that the masses' desire to engage in the great criticism was a good thing and that suspecting others of attempting to cause a split was groundless. They examined their own erroneous thoughts at a meeting of all service personnel and promised to fiercely criticize selfishness in the future, go deep into the masses, live, study, and fight together with the masses, and forever be the masses' students. They also took measures to strengthen the leadership of the great criticism. In this way, the contradiction was quickly resolved.

The revolutionary faction of the Agricultural College believes that when encountering various contradictions among the people, the leadership should first take responsibility and not easily support one side while attacking the other. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings on humbly listening to the masses' opinions, they objectively analyzed various right and wrong issues, correctly supporting the right and opposing the wrong. Recently, one combat team posted a big-character poster to the headquarters, criticizing the current revolutionary situation in the school and severely criticizing the headquarters' work. Another combat team expressed the opposite view, believing that the current situation in the school was excellent and that the headquarters' work was good, and accused the first combat team of attempting to undermine the headquarters. When handling this issue, the leadership core did not support the latter and attack the former. After analysis and research, they believed that although the first big-character poster's view on the situation was one-sided, the suggestions given to the headquarters were correct; although the second big-character poster's view on the situation was correct, accusing the combat team that gave suggestions to the headquarters was inappropriate. They correctly handled this issue, raising both sides' awareness and eliminating the opposing sentiments.

Because the revolutionary faction of the Agricultural College could correctly handle contradictions among the people based on Chairman Mao's teachings, after achieving the great union of revolutionary mass organizations in April, the entire school did not experience factional struggles or "internal wars." The prestige of the leftist core greatly increased.

In resolving the contradictions between the revolutionary faction and erring cadres, the revolutionary faction particularly focused on the active thoughts within the revolutionary faction.

"In the past, we fought you, and now we are liberating you. Isn't this a contradiction?" This was the main psychological barrier in correctly treating erring cadres. To address this psychological barrier, revolutionary comrades studied Chairman Mao's teachings on cadre policy, corrected the metaphysical view of not being able to see cadres in a comprehensive way, and criticized the reactionary trend of "overthrowing everything and doubting everything." Some comrades said, "Cadres cannot be liberated because we have not liberated ourselves from petty-bourgeois views, so to liberate cadres, we must first overcome the petty-bourgeois thoughts in our own minds." With a unified mind within the revolutionary faction, they adopted various methods to do ideological work on the cadres. The young rebels took a trusting attitude towards the erring cadres, encouraging every revolutionary action they took. Recently, with the support of revolutionary comrades, the cadres themselves established a great criticism linkage station. In addition to participating in class activities, they also held separate struggle-criticism-transformation meetings, ran great criticism columns, and displayed initiative and creativity.

Regarding the issue of comrades who were misled, there were also many active thoughts within the revolutionary faction, such as, "They implemented the reactionary line, shouldn't we criticize them?" To address these active thoughts, the revolutionary headquarters led all revolutionary young rebels to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works. Through study, they distinguished between friends and enemies, realizing that comrades who had participated in conservative organizations were their class brothers. They accounted for all debts, large and small, to the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia. With improved ideological understanding, they changed from mistrusting to trusting the misled comrades. Even when ideological work was not smooth, they did not become impatient. The revolutionary young rebels said, "We should have the spirit of proletarian revolutionaries, for the sake of revolutionary interests, we should not fear trouble or setbacks, persist in doing ideological work thoroughly, and win them over." Now, many misled comrades have "come out" from the bourgeois reactionary line and have become a new batch of revolutionary vanguards in the school, making new contributions to the revolutionary great criticism.

### 用毛泽东思想统一干部思想，加强领导核心的团结　内蒙古农牧学院进一步从思想上巩固革命大联合

　　用毛泽东思想统一干部思想，加强领导核心的团结
　　内蒙古农牧学院进一步从思想上巩固革命大联合
    本报讯　内蒙古农牧学院的革命群众组织在今年四月份实现了革命的大联合以后，十分重视巩固领导核心的团结，把各种可能导致革命派内部分裂的因素消灭在萌芽状态。他们遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，不断克服形形色色的小资产阶级思想。经过半年多的努力，团结了百分之九十五以上的干部和群众，巩固和发展了革命的大联合，促进了革命的大批判。最近全校根据毛主席的最新指示，掀起了“斗私，批修”的高潮，下决心把农牧学院办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    农牧学院实现革命大联合以后，摆在革命派面前的主要矛盾仍然是无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾。但同时也面临着各种人民内部矛盾，这就是：革命派群众内部的矛盾，革命派同受蒙蔽群众之间的矛盾，革命派同犯错误的干部之间的矛盾。这些矛盾必然要集中地反映到革命派领导核心中来。在这种情况下，领导核心的团结具有决定性的意义。领导骨干的思想能够在毛泽东思想原则的基础上统一起来，正确地处理领导核心之间的各种矛盾，就会有利于处理革命派内部的矛盾，使全院革命派在不断克服矛盾的过程中，统一思想，统一步调，不断前进。
    农牧学院发生过这样一件事：七月末，有些班的战斗队，认为校革命派总勤务站抓大批判不力，想另行成立一个大批判联络站。对这件事，在总勤务站内部出现了意见分歧。有人说，这个战斗队想闹分裂；另一些人则认为不能这样看，因为搞大批判的大方向是对的。在群众中也很快形成两种对立意见，大字报满天飞，一度对峙得很厉害。为此，总勤务站领导决定进行整风，展开辩论，最后统一了认识，肯定群众要搞大批判是好事，怀疑别人搞分裂是没有根据的。他们在全体勤务员会上检查了自己的错误思想，并且保证，今后要狠斗“私”字，深入到群众中去，同群众一起生活，一起学习，一起战斗，永远做群众的小学生。他们还采取了措施，加强了对大批判的领导。这样，矛盾很快就解决了。
    农牧学院革命派认为，在遇到各种人民内部矛盾时，领导首先应该承担责任，而不应当轻易地支持一方意见，打击另一方意见。他们根据毛主席关于虚心听取群众意见的教导，对各种是非问题，都作客观的分析，正确的支持，错误的反对。前些日子，一个战斗队给总部写了一张大字报，认为目前学校革命形势不好，严厉地批评了总部的工作；另一个战斗队表示了相反看法，认为目前学校形势大好，总部的工作不错，并说这个战斗队写这样的大字报是妄图搞垮总部。领导核心在处理这个问题时不是支持后者，打击前者。他们经过分析研究，认为前一张大字报对形势的看法虽然片面，但给总部提的意见是正确的；后一张大字报虽然对形势的看法是正确的，但指责给总部提意见的战斗队，也是不妥当的。他们正确处理了这个问题，就提高了双方的认识，消除了对立情绪。
    由于农牧学院的革命派能够根据毛主席的教导正确处理人民内部矛盾，在四月份实现革命群众组织大联合后，整个学校没有出现派别之争，没有发生打“内战”的情况。左派核心的威信大大提高了。
    农牧学院革命派在解决他们同犯错误干部之间的矛盾过程中，特别注意抓革命派内部的活思想。
      “过去斗了你，现在又解放你，岂不是自相矛盾？”这是正确对待犯错误干部的主要思想障碍。针对这个思想障碍，革命派同志学习了毛主席关于干部政策的教导，纠正了不能一分为二看干部的形而上学观点，批判了“打倒一切，怀疑一切”的反动思潮。有的同志说：“干部不能解放，是因为我们自己的思想没有从小资产阶级观点中解放出来，因而，要解放干部，首先应该克服我们自己头脑中的小资产阶级思想。”革命派内部齐了心，就采取各种方法对干部做思想工作。小将们对犯错误的干部采取信任的态度，鼓励他们的每一个革命行动。最近，在革命派同志支持下，干部们自己建立了一个大批判串连站，除参加班级活动外，还单独召开了斗批会，办大批判专栏，发挥了主动性和创造性。
    在对待受蒙蔽的同学的问题上，革命派内部也有不少活思想，如：“他们执行反动路线，还不该整他们一下？”针对一些活思想，革命派总部带动全体革命小将反复学习毛主席著作，通过学习，分清了敌友，认识到参加过保守组织的同学，是自己的阶级兄弟，千笔账，万笔账，都要算到中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人的身上。思想认识提高了，他们对受蒙蔽的同学就从不信任转为信任。有时思想工作做得不顺利，也不急躁。革命小将说，我们应该有无产阶级革命者的气魄，为了革命的利益要不怕麻烦，不怕碰钉子，坚持把思想工作做到家，把他们争取过来。现在，许多受蒙蔽的同学从资产阶级反动路线中“杀”了出来，成为学校中一批新的革命闯将，为革命的大批判立下了新功。（附图片）
