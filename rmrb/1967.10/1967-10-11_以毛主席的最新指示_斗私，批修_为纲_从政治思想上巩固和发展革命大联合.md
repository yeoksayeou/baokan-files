The revolutionary masses of the Nankou Locomotive Depot, with the help of the PLA, have been continuously eliminating the petty bourgeois factionalism of small "mountaintops," enhancing proletarian party spirit, uniting against the enemy, and jointly criticizing revisionism.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 9th, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the PLA, currently carrying out support-left tasks at the Nankou Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau, has taken Mao Zedong's latest instruction of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline. They have been focusing on the active thoughts after achieving the revolutionary great alliance, guiding the masses to sit down and seriously study and apply Mao Zedong's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate petty bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and further consolidate the revolutionary great alliance in terms of political ideology.

During the Cultural Revolution, the two larger mass organizations at the Nankou Locomotive Depot had engaged in "internal warfare." Recently, the revolutionary masses of the two organizations studied Mao Zedong's great instruction that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two opposing factions." With the help of the PLA, they achieved the revolutionary great alliance. However, after the alliance, a few people still clung to their small "mountaintops," vying for "positions" when forming the leading group, and some members even boasted about having a large organization, feeling that they had been "wronged" after the alliance. The soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, through in-depth investigations, discovered these problems. They unanimously agreed that to consolidate the revolutionary great alliance, it is necessary to pay great attention to political and ideological work, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline. They helped the masses use Mao Zedong Thought to continuously overcome petty bourgeois ideology, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance. Thus, they assisted the larger of the two revolutionary mass organizations in holding a meeting to discuss and criticize selfishness, reviewing Mao Zedong's instruction on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and his great teaching on "guiding the petty bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the revolutionary path of the proletariat." They compared these with Mao Zedong's great strategic deployment and the current battle tasks, fiercely criticizing the "self" in their minds. Under the education and inspiration of the PLA, many comrades made sincere self-criticisms. They said: To highlight one's own small "mountaintop" and boast about having a large organization is a manifestation of factionalism, a product of selfishness. If not immediately overcome, it will corrupt the soul and harm the revolution. Those who originally vied for "positions" and "seats" changed their views, and those who clung to small mountaintops also expressed their determination to follow Mao Zedong's strategic deployment and actively promote the revolutionary great alliance. The high-level self-criticism of this revolutionary mass organization greatly educated the other revolutionary mass organization. They movedly said: Doing revolution is not for the benefit of one faction but for the interests of the entire working class. Thus, the Nankou Locomotive Depot quickly formed a new leadership body, the Great Alliance Committee.

After achieving the revolutionary great alliance, there were various active thoughts among the masses at the Nankou Locomotive Depot. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, organized the masses to repeatedly study Mao Zedong's great teachings on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution" and his brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," helping them to recognize the direction of the struggle. At the same time, based on in-depth investigations and research, they identified the estrangement and disagreements among comrades caused by the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, holding meetings to fight "selfishness," letting everyone sit together to study Mao Zedong's works, discuss problems, reveal thoughts, and criticize selfishness. Through meticulous political and ideological work, the broad revolutionary masses clarified the direction of the struggle. Many people voluntarily made self-criticisms to the other side, some sought out comrades with the most differing opinions for heart-to-heart talks, and those who originally could not sit together became close friends. Everyone said that to resolve the contradictions within our ranks, we must fiercely criticize the "self" in our minds, make more self-criticisms, and adhere to the policy of unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity. Only by overthrowing the "self" in our minds and uniting together can we overthrow and expose the Chinese Khrushchev. Under the help of the PLA, the unity among the broad revolutionary masses became even stronger.

In the initial days of achieving the great alliance, some masses said, "Now that we are united, we can take a breather." A few people developed a slack attitude. The soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, targeting the active thoughts of the masses, again took "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, organizing the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong's works. They first guided everyone to review Mao Zedong's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," pointing out that class struggle vigilance must not be lost, and the fundamental task of the proletarian cultural revolution must not be forgotten. Achieving the revolutionary great alliance is not the end of the struggle but the beginning of a new and better struggle. Through symposiums, discussions, and individual heart-to-heart talks, they helped the revolutionary masses review the facts of class struggle since the cultural revolution, deeply exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist road in this unit. These activities further aroused the revolutionary masses' hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist road, making them see more clearly the reactionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line. Everyone's direction became more unified, and their targets more concentrated.

　　以毛主席的最新指示“斗私，批修”为纲
　　从政治思想上巩固和发展革命大联合
　　南口机务段革命群众在解放军的帮助下，不断清除小“山头”的小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，一致对敌，共同批修。
    据新华社九日讯　正在北京铁路局南口机务段执行支左任务的解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，以毛主席“斗私，批修”的最新指示为纲，狠抓实现革命大联合以后的活思想，引导群众坐下来，认真活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想清除小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，进一步从政治思想上巩固了革命的大联合。
    在文化大革命中，南口机务段两个较大的群众组织曾经打过“内战”。不久前，两个组织的革命群众学习了毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的伟大指示，在解放军的帮助下，实现了革命的大联合。但是联合以后，还有少数人留恋小“山头”，在成立领导小组时，争“名额”，个别成员甚至以人多组织大自居，认为联合以后“吃了亏”。毛泽东思想宣传队的指战员，通过深入调查，发现这些问题，一致认为要巩固革命大联合，必须十分重视做好政治思想工作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，帮助群众用毛泽东思想不断战胜小资产阶级思想，巩固和发展革命的大联合。于是，他们帮助较大的一个革命群众组织开斗私谈心会，重温毛主席“斗私，批修”的指示和“把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的伟大教导，对照毛主席的伟大战略部署和当前的战斗任务，狠造头脑中“私”字的反。在解放军的教育启发下，许多同志作了诚恳的自我批评。他们说：想突出自己的小“山头”，以大组织自居，这是派性的表现，是“私”字作怪，不立即克服，灵魂要遭侵蚀，革命要受损害。原来争“名额”“争席位”的同志改变了自己的看法，留恋小山头的同志，也表示要紧跟毛主席的战略部署，积极搞好革命大联合。这个革命群众组织高姿态的自我批评，使另一个革命群众组织的同志受到很大教育。他们感动地说：干革命不是为那一派争利，而是为的整个工人阶级利益。这样，南口机务段很快产生了新的领导机构大联合委员会。
    南口机务段实现了革命大联合以后，在广大群众中有各种各样的活思想。毛泽东思想宣传队以“斗私，批修”为纲，组织群众反复学习毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的伟大教导，和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，帮助他们认清斗争的大方向。同时，在深入调查研究的基础上，摸清在资产阶级反动路线影响下所造成同志之间的隔阂和意见，举行斗“私”会，让大家坐在一起共同学习毛主席著作，摆问题，亮思想，斗私心。通过深入细致的政治思想工作，广大革命群众明确了斗争大方向。许多人主动向对方作自我批评，有的找和自己意见最多的同志谈心，原来坐不到一起的，现在成了知心朋友。大家说，解决我们队伍内部的矛盾，必须狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，多作自我批评，坚持团结——批评和自我批评——团结的方针。只有把头脑里的“私”字斗倒，团结起来，才能把中国赫鲁晓夫斗倒斗臭。在解放军的帮助下，广大革命群众之间的团结比过去更加坚强了。
    南口机务段实现大联合的最初几天，有的群众说：“联合了，可以缓口气了。”少数人产生了松劲情绪。毛泽东思想宣传队的指战员，针对着群众的活思想，又以“斗私，批修”为纲，组织广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作。他们首先引导大家重温了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，指出，决不能丧失阶级斗争警惕，忘记无产阶级文化大革命的根本任务。实现革命大联合不是斗争的结束，而是新的更好的斗争的开始。他们通过座谈会、讨论会和个别谈心等各种方式，帮助革命群众回顾文化大革命以来阶级斗争的事实，深入地揭发批判中国的赫鲁晓夫和本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。这些活动，进一步激发了革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的仇恨，更加看清资产阶级反动路线的反动实质，大家的方向更一致了，目标更集中了。
