Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit. This must be resolved.

We follow the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "believe in and rely on the majority of cadres" and resolutely support cadres in standing up for revolution and boldly use revolutionary cadres. Huazhong Institute of Technology has a total of 135 cadres, of which 105 have been liberated, and some are now serving as leaders in various levels of revolutionary committees.

Below, we discuss our understanding and experience in liberating cadres:

Liberating cadres politically and ideologically

Due to the old Hubei Provincial Party Committee work team's stubborn implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" by Khrushchev, from September last year to February this year, Huazhong Institute of Technology had over 100 cadres (including a few teachers) from the Party Committee to the Party branches forced to undergo labor reform or stand aside. They found it difficult to contact the masses and engage in the movement.

In January this year, after the proletarian revolutionary factions of Huazhong Institute of Technology seized power, they strictly distinguished between two types of contradictions and seriously analyzed the situation of cadres in the institute using Mao Zedong Thought. They liberated cadres in batches who were good or relatively good, as well as those who, although had committed serious errors, were not anti-party or anti-socialist but persisted in not changing and were repeatedly educated. These cadres were liberated from forced labor reform to participate in the movement.

Liberating cadres is more importantly about liberating them politically and ideologically. It is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" among the broad masses and cadres. Otherwise, it will be impossible to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of "uniting the majority and striking down a few" on the cadre issue. After most cadres were liberated organizationally, they still had many ideological problems, mainly the fear of being labeled as "opportunists," "not sincere," or "monsters and demons rebelling." Some who had made mistakes feared saying or doing the wrong things, leading to more mistakes. Therefore, they chose not to speak out or take a stand, adopting a passive attitude of waiting for the masses to pass judgment on them. Some masses, influenced by the "smash everything" and "doubt everything" of the top handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, did not pay attention to distinguishing cadres from the perspective of class struggle, two lines, and two roads, but generally categorized them as "masses" and "power-holders." Therefore, they dared not boldly liberate cadres. In this situation, we organized cadres to expose and denounce the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues, making the broad masses and cadres realize that they were all victims of the bourgeois reactionary line and should unite closely to fight the enemy together.

In the class struggle, temper and test cadres

To thoroughly liberate cadres politically and ideologically, it is necessary to put cadres on the front line of class struggle, temper and test them in the struggle, and let cadres educate themselves and liberate themselves in the struggle. We specially convened a revolutionary cadre rebellion mobilization meeting, calling on all revolutionary cadres and those who want to make a revolution and are willing to correct their mistakes to boldly stand up for revolution and rebellion, and created various convenient conditions to resolutely support their revolutionary actions. This greatly aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of revolutionary cadres. In the struggle to smash the capitalist restoration tide and in the great criticism, they, together with the broad revolutionary masses, achieved new merits. In the current struggle of "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self," they fiercely criticized "self" and tempered themselves in the struggle.

The masses should handle the cadre issue with "one look and two helps," do in-depth and detailed ideological work, and adhere to the principle of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." Use the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to help cadres who have made mistakes. Allow them to make mistakes and correct them. Help them, wait for them, and do not knock down cadres for every mistake; otherwise, it will be impossible to unite and educate the majority of cadres. We adopted the method of patient persuasion and education for cadres, letting them go out for investigations and sending them to the front line of struggle. In front of a large number of facts, many cadres changed their views, became more resolute in the struggle, and more cadres were won over.

Always pay attention to expanding the scope of education

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there have been many twists and turns, and at every turning point, there will inevitably be a batch of cadres who lag behind the situation and make mistakes, even serious mistakes. For the mistakes made by cadres, as Chairman Mao said, "As long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who persist in their errors and are repeatedly educated, they should be allowed to correct their mistakes and encouraged to make amends for their mistakes." For those who made mistakes before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and for those who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, their mistakes should be analyzed seriously and objectively. The environment, historical conditions, and nature of the mistakes should be clarified. Attack one point without considering the rest, exaggerate facts, and arbitrarily elevate the level of mistakes, killing the cadres with one blow. This is a wrong practice that goes against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. For example, one of our cadres was originally a member of the presidium of the representative assembly created by the work team and had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Later, after being severely criticized by the masses, he realized his mistakes. The revolutionary masses further enthusiastically helped him, making him quickly draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line and the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In the struggle to smash the capitalist restoration tide, he performed exceptionally well and was elected as a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee when the revolutionary committee was established.

Put good revolutionary cadres in leadership positions

Chairman Mao said, "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Some leading cadres who have been tempered and tested in the struggle have organized command groups on their own initiative in critical moments of struggle, providing strategies for revolutionary youngsters. Through a series of practical struggles, the broad masses have further recognized the importance of revolutionary cadres. As long as a large number of outstanding revolutionary leading cadres participate in the leadership core and combine with the broad revolutionary masses, the struggle to seize power can be carried out more smoothly, and power can be truly grasped more quickly.

Due to the efforts of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, we have organized, planned, and selected those outstanding revolutionary leading cadres who have been tempered in the struggle to various positions in the command department, brigades, and armies. Thus, we gradually formed the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership core. After the conditions were ripe, we established the temporary power organ—the New Huazhong Institute of Technology Revolutionary Committee.

To further deepen and develop the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to ensure the powerful development of our various work, we will follow Chairman Mao's instructions, continue to examine and identify cadres in the struggle, and take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key. We will select outstanding cadres to various leadership positions and liberate all cadres who can be liberated.

    正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。					毛泽东
    我们对解放干部的认识和体会
    华中工学院革命委员会斗批改办公室
    我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的要“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，坚决地支持干部站出来革命，大胆地使用革命干部。华中工学院共一百三十五名干部，现在已解放了一百零五名，其中有的现在担任着各级革命委员会的领导工作。
    下面谈谈我们对解放干部的认识和体会：从政治思想上解放干部
    由于旧湖北省委工作组在我院顽固地推行中国赫鲁晓夫“打击一大片、保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，从去年九月份到今年二月份，华中工学院从党委到党支部有一百多个干部（包括少数教师）被强迫参加劳动改造，或者靠边站。他们都难于接触群众，难于接触运动。
    今年一月份，华中工学院的无产阶级革命派夺权之后，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，用毛泽东思想认真地分析了我院干部的状况，成批成批地把那些好的和比较好的，以及那些虽然犯有严重错误但还不是反党、反社会主义而又坚持不改、屡教不改的干部，从强迫劳改中解放出来参加运动。
    解放干部，更重要的是从政治上思想上解放他们。必须在广大群众中和广大干部中彻底肃清在干部问题上“打击一大片、保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，否则就不可能在干部问题上贯彻“团结大多数、打击一小撮”这条毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。大多数干部在组织上获得解放以后，还存在着许多思想问题，主要是“怕”字当头。怕别人说自己是“投机”、“不老实”、“牛鬼蛇神翻天”。有些人犯过这样那样的错误，怕说错了话，做错了事，错上加错。所以干脆不亮相、不表态，抱着消极挨整的态度，等待群众给自己下结论。有些群众由于受了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“打倒一切”、“怀疑一切”的影响，不注意从两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争上去识别干部，而笼统地区分什么“群众”和“当权派”，因此不敢大胆放手解放干部。在这种情况下，我们就组织干部揭发和控诉在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，使广大干部和群众认识到彼此都是资产阶级反动路线受害者，应当紧密团结起来，共同对敌。
        在阶级斗争中锻炼考察干部
    要彻底从政治思想上解放干部，必须把干部放到阶级斗争的第一线去，在斗争中去经受考验和锻炼，让干部在斗争中自己教育自己，自己解放自己。我们专门召开了一次革命干部造反动员大会，号召一切革命干部，一切要革命的、犯了错误而愿意改正的干部，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大胆起来革命，起来造反，并且给他们创造种种便利条件，坚决支持他们的一切革命行动。这样就大大激发了革命干部的革命热情，在粉碎资本主义复辟逆流的斗争中，在革命大批判中，他们和广大革命群众一起，立了新功。在当前“斗私，批修”战斗中，他们又狠斗“私”字，在斗争中经受锻炼。
    群众对待干部的问题要“一看二帮”，要做深入细致的思想工作，要本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式帮助犯错误的干部。要允许他们犯错误，允许他们改正错误。要帮助他们，等待他们，不要干部一有错误就打倒，否则就不能团结教育大多数干部。我们对干部采取耐心说服教育的方法，让他们外出调查，要他们到斗争第一线去，在大量的事实面前，使很多干部改变了看法，在斗争中更坚决了，争取的干部更多了。
        要始终注意扩大教育面
    在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，有许多曲折和反复，在每个转折关头，必然有一批干部跟不上形势犯了错误，甚至犯了严重的错误。对于干部所犯的错误，正如毛主席所说“只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。”“对于犯了严重错误的干部，只要他们不再坚持错误，认真改正，并为广大革命群众所谅解了之后，仍然可以站起来，参加革命行列。”有的干部是无产阶级文化大革命以前犯的错误，有的是在文化大革命运动中执行了资产阶级反动路线，对于他们的错误，要用严肃的态度，进行实事求是的分析。要弄清所犯错误的环境、历史条件和性质。攻其一点，不及其余，夸大事实，无限上纲，把犯错误的同志“一棍子打死”，这是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的错误做法。例如我院有一个干部，原是工作组所炮制的代表大会主席团的成员，曾经执行了资产阶级反动路线，后来经过群众严肃的批判，认识到了自己的错误，革命群众就进一步热情地帮助他，使他很快地和资产阶级反动路线，和党内走资本主义道路的当权派划清了界限。在粉碎资本主义复辟逆流的斗争中，他表现非常突出，革命委员会成立时，被推选为革命委员会常委。
      把好的革命干部选到领导岗位
    毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”一些在斗争中经过锻炼和考验站出来的领导干部，在斗争的紧急关头，自动组织参谋小组，为革命小将出谋划策。通过一系列的斗争实践，使广大战士更进一步认识到了革命干部的重要性，只要大批的优秀革命领导干部参加了领导核心，同广大革命群众结合起来，就能比较顺利地进行夺权斗争，就能较快地把权真正掌握起来。
    由于广大革命群众和革命干部的努力，在斗争中团结、争取、教育了干部的大多数，我们就有组织、有计划地把那些在斗争中锻炼出来的优秀的革命领导干部选拔到司令部、各大队、各兵团工作，这样就逐步形成了革命“三结合”的领导核心。在条件成熟以后，建立了临时权力机构——新华工革命委员会。
    为了无产阶级文化大革命进一步深入发展的需要，为了保证我们各项工作的有力开展，我们将按照毛主席的教导，在斗争中，以“斗私，批修”为纲，继续考察和识别干部，把表现突出的干部选拔到各级领导岗位上来，把能够解放的干部都解放出来。
