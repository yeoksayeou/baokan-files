Shukeiri Reiterates Continuation of Armed Struggle

The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Shukeiri, reiterated that the Palestinian people will continue their armed struggle and will not allow anyone to barter Palestinian territory in the so-called political settlement of the Middle East issue by the United Nations. Shukeiri said at a press conference held in Beirut on the 13th that the Palestinian people will eventually develop from guerrilla actions into a people's war supported by the entire Arab nation.

Italy's Employment Numbers Decrease by Over a Million in Eight Years

According to materials released by the Italian Central Statistical Office, under the deteriorating economic conditions in Italy, the current number of employed people in Italy is more than a million less than it was eight years ago. In agriculture, due to the bankruptcy of many small farmers, a large number of peasants have been displaced.

By the end of December 1966, four million eight hundred thousand Italians had been forced to seek employment abroad due to unemployment.

A Coal Mine Fire in Japan Results in Heavy Casualties

Due to the disregard for workers' lives by Japanese monopolistic capitalists, a fire occurred at the Miike Coal Mine in Omuta, Fukuoka on September 28, resulting in the deaths of seven workers and poisoning of three hundred and sixty others.

The Mitsui zaibatsu-owned Miike Coal Mine has consistently treated workers' lives as a joke, repeatedly refusing to strengthen safety measures within the mine. This resulted in a major gas explosion in November 1963, where four hundred and fifty-eight workers died and over eight hundred were poisoned.

U.S. Imperialism Exploits Indian Famine to Intensify Cultural Invasion

U.S. imperialism is currently exploiting the severe famine in India to intensify its cultural invasion through missionary work and the expansion of its followers, aiming to numb and deceive the broad masses of the Indian people. According to a U.S. missionary, there is an agreement between India and the United States, under which the Indian government grants U.S. missionaries "full freedom" to expand their following in the disaster-stricken areas. Currently, there are approximately two thousand six hundred U.S. Christian missionaries active across India. These missionaries are exploiting the severe disaster in India through various means to induce disaster victims to join Christianity.

The cultural invasion activities of U.S. missionaries are facing increasing condemnation and opposition from more and more Indian people.
