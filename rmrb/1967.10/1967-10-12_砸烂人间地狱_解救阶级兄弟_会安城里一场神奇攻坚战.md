	Smashing the Hell on Earth and Rescuing Class Brothers
		A Miraculous Battle in Hoi An

	The Hoi An prison in the southern province of Quang Nam, Vietnam, was established during the French colonial period. Before the fall of Ngo Dinh Diem, it was expanded to suppress the revolutionary people. Many patriots from the south were imprisoned here, making it one of the most brutal hells on earth under the puppet regime of South Vietnam. Soldiers from a certain unit of the Quang Nam Liberation Army had long decided to smash this prison.

	One night in July, the soldiers of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army silently approached the prison gate. Suddenly, a powerful explosion from a grenade launcher cleared the obstacles, and the gate was blown open. The three rows of barbed wire inside were blown away. In an instant, a hand grenade exploded, instantly killing the enemy lieutenant Alkan, captain Alon, and prison officer Afu. Another hand grenade exploded in the enemy barracks, annihilating all the guards.

	The detonation wires for the mines buried under the two rows of cells were cut as soon as the Liberation Army entered the prison. Four assault teams of the Liberation Army, like four divine arrows, swiftly eliminated the enemy strongholds at the four corners of the prison. The battle lasted only seven minutes, and all the enemy guards were annihilated. At the same time, to support the battle, another "spear" of the Liberation Army penetrated the central area of Hoi An City, attacking the enemy's fake organizations and police stations. The Liberation Army's mortars continuously bombarded the enemy's Quang Nam-Da Nang Special Zone Command and the Provincial Security Command. The sound of gunfire and explosions echoed throughout Hoi An City.

	At this moment, the iron doors of the cells were opened. The patriots, who had suffered endless torture, saw the light of day again. They saw the long-awaited flag of the National Liberation Front. In the joyous crowd, everyone wanted to shake hands and embrace the relatives who had come through countless hardships to rescue them—the soldiers of the Liberation Army.

	After completing the mission, the soldiers of the Liberation Army and the freed patriots immediately left the prison and safely returned to the liberated areas in multiple groups. It was only then that the enemy dared to come out, and they even requested protection from American artillery. However, the American cannons on the Kim River fired back at them, and they hurriedly requested the cessation of the bombardment. The enemy sent planes, dropping many flares in an attempt to track the Liberation Army. But they would never find them.

　　砸烂人间地狱　解救阶级兄弟
    会安城里一场神奇攻坚战
    越南南方广南省的会安监狱是在法国殖民统治时期建立的。在吴庭艳倒台之前，为了大肆镇压革命人民，曾把这所监狱扩建。这里关禁着许多南方爱国者，是南越傀儡集团统治下最残酷的人间地狱之一。广南省解放军某单位的战士早已下决心把这个监狱砸烂。
    七月中的一个晚上，南越解放军战士神不知鬼不觉地来到监狱的前门。突然，爆破筒猛烈爆炸，障碍物一扫而光，前门被炸开了。门内的三道铁丝网被炸飞了。转眼间，随着一颗手雷爆炸，敌军大尉阿干、中尉阿隆和监狱官阿财当场丧命。另一颗手雷在敌人营房爆炸，全歼守卫监狱的恶棍。
    敌人埋藏在两排牢房地里的地雷的导火线，在解放军刚攻进监狱时就被切断了。解放军的四支突击队，象四枚神箭射向监狱四角的四个碉堡，迅速拔除敌人据点。战斗打响只不过七分钟，守卫监狱的敌人全部被歼灭。与此同时，为了配合战斗，解放军的另一把“尖刀”插进会安市中心区，袭击敌伪机关和警察所。解放军的迫击炮不断向敌伪的广南—岘港特区指挥所和省保安队指挥部轰击。会安市到处响起了震耳的枪声和爆炸声。
    就在这时，各间牢房的铁门打开了。受尽敌人折磨的爱国者重见了天日。他们看见了渴望已久的民族解放阵线的旗帜。在欢腾雀跃的人群中，谁都想跟越过千艰万苦前来解救自己的亲人——解放军战士握手、拥抱。
    在完成任务之后，解放军战士和自由了的爱国者立即离开监狱，分多路安全地走回解放区。这时，敌人才敢出来，而且要求美军炮火保护。可是锦河美军大炮却轰到他们的头上，他们又慌忙要求停止炮轰。敌人派了飞机，投下许多照明弹，企图追踪解放军。但他们是永远也找不到的。
