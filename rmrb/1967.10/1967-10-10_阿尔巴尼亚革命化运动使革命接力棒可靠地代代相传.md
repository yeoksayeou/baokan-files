Comrade Shehu Delivers Important Speech at the Wuhan Mass Rally Welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation

The Albanian revolutionary movement ensures the reliable passing of the revolutionary torch from generation to generation.

Albania will certainly emerge victorious in its struggle against imperialists, Khrushchev revisionists, and Tito revisionists.

Comrade Shehu, with immense enthusiasm, praises the Chinese Cultural Revolution as a historic event of global significance. The victory of the Cultural Revolution shows the communists and people in countries ruled by revisionist cliques how to rise up and overthrow the revisionist clique, reestablishing proletarian dictatorship; it shows the genuine communists within communist and workers' parties, whose leadership has been usurped by revisionists and traitors, how to overthrow the revisionist traitor leadership, and lead their parties back to the true path of Marxism-Leninism; it greatly inspires the oppressed peoples of the world to fight for freedom from imperialist oppression; it greatly promotes the international proletariat's revolutionary struggle against capitalist and bourgeois oppression.

New China News Agency, Wuhan, October 9th - Comrade Shehu's speech at the Wuhan mass rally welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation is as follows:

Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuchun, Comrade Zeng Shiyi, Comrades from the workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses of Wuhan:

At this crucial moment in your participation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and your brave advancement of this revolution, our delegation has the honor to visit the capital of Hubei Province, this city of revolutionary tradition - Wuhan, to conduct friendly visits and meet with you. We are very pleased. Dear comrades, on behalf of the Albanian people, our Party and government, and our beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, I extend the warmest revolutionary greetings and the most sincere wishes to you, to the proletarian revolutionaries of Wuhan and all the people of the city. We wish you greater achievements on the glorious revolutionary path illuminated by the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. We sincerely thank Comrade Mao Zedong for inviting our delegation to visit your great revolutionary city - Wuhan.

We sincerely thank Comrade Zhou Enlai for his enthusiastic speech at the rally, for his high evaluation of the revolutionary stance and actions of our Party and people, and for the strong support of the People's Republic of China to the People's Republic of Albania. This is the deep friendship of the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao towards our Party and people. This is a great encouragement and strong support for us, enabling us to advance more resolutely on the path of socialism and communism under the guidance of the general line of Marxism-Leninism of our Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha. This will further strengthen the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples and parties, deepen our struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and better fulfill our proletarian internationalist duties.

Dear friends, the honor you have bestowed on us by organizing this grand gathering, your enthusiastic, fraternal, and sincere welcome everywhere, and the joy and happiness that spontaneously burst forth from your revolutionary hearts make us feel as if we are at home. The pure revolutionary sentiments you express are, like the seven hundred million people of China towards the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party, a manifestation of the great unbreakable friendship between Albania and China. On behalf of our delegation, I sincerely thank you for this very warm and cordial welcome. We assure you that the Albanian people also harbor the same fraternal feelings towards your great and glorious people.

In the history of your several hundred million great people, Wuhan is famous as a strong base of the Chinese revolution. The people of Wuhan and Hubei Province are closely connected with the Communist Party of China. Under the Party's leadership, in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies and in achieving the historic victory of October 1, 1949, they made outstanding contributions. These days, in a joyful atmosphere and in the unprecedented high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we celebrate the 18th anniversary of the National Day together with you.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has written a new chapter in the glorious revolutionary history of your country, Wuhan, and the Wuhan region. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, you have fundamentally changed the face of your country with selfless labor. Steel combines, heavy machinery factories, meat processing plants, the first cotton mill, a batch of food processing plants, the magnificent Yangtze River Bridge, and many other projects have beautified and strengthened your Wuhan and Wuhan region and have become the pride of the entire China and all the Chinese people.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is of great significance. The Wuhan leftist revolutionary forces, loyal to the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his revolutionary line, have exposed and smashed the plots of the Party and people's enemies to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, smashed the bourgeois reactionary line of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, bravely defended the Marxist-Leninist line of Comrade Mao Zedong, and strengthened the proletarian dictatorship. Wuhan revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, and the People's Liberation Army support and inspire each other, unite closely, fight together, and win together. Thus, they have written a new great victory for the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in their glorious history.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest event in the history of the Chinese people since the founding of the People's Republic of China 18 years ago. The fundamental issue of this great revolution is the issue of state power. In a socialist country where the proletariat is in power, the issue of state power remains the fundamental issue of the revolution. The fact that the bourgeois revisionists have usurped important positions in the Party and state and attempted to drag China back to the capitalist road has determined the historical necessity of this great revolution. This revolution has proven the Marxist-Leninist principle that class struggle exists in socialist countries throughout the entire historical period of transition from capitalism to communism, that there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and that there is a danger of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a comprehensive revolution that sweeps through all aspects of life, including politics, ideology, culture, economy, military, and diplomacy. First of all, it is a great revolution of people's minds, a revolution to transform people's minds, to make people's minds revolutionary, to eliminate all the filth of the old world, and to strive for the complete victory of proletarian ideology, morality, and culture, and the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. It is a revolution to determine who will be victorious in the ideological realm of the People's Republic of China - socialism or capitalism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized hundreds of millions of Chinese people, once again proving the Marxist-Leninist proposition that only under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the conditions of mass democracy, by absorbing the masses to participate in the management of state affairs, and by establishing the supervision of the masses over the Party, state, and economic departments as well as cadres at all levels, can the danger of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique seizing power be avoided, can the proletarian dictatorship be defended, and can the cause of socialism be advanced.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and guided by the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are the driving force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The foundation of this unity is the revolutionary mass organizations, the fighting combination of the People's Liberation Army units and revolutionary leading cadres. The Red Guards are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the Red Guard movement is a product of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new form of organization for revolutionary youth in China.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution carried out according to the revolutionary theory and thought of the great leader of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong is a great Marxist-Leninist who, closely combining the practice of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction with the development of international communism and revolutionary movements, has made outstanding contributions to the defense and further development of Marxism-Leninism in the past and present.

The Chinese people have responded with great enthusiasm to the call of Comrade Mao Zedong's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, to "study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." The broad masses of the Chinese people are studying and applying the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, which is a great movement to revolutionize the ideology and worldview of one-quarter of the world's population.

Currently, the political class struggle between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters is a life-and-death struggle between socialism and counter-revolution. Therefore, the revolutionary vanguards of the proletariat must be united to smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist grand conspiracy of the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev is attempting to achieve in China what his comrade Nikita Khrushchev achieved in the Soviet Union.

The historic resolution of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has further promoted the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The essence of the plenum's resolution is embodied in Comrade Mao Zedong's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," which was issued at a crucial moment in the fierce struggle between the socialist and capitalist lines. This big-character poster expresses the revolutionary masses' deep hatred for the class enemies who attempt to strangle the revolutionary cause, overthrow the proletarian dictatorship, and establish bourgeois dictatorship in China.

We are very pleased to see that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has now entered a new stage. In places where power needs to be seized, revolutionary organizations have seized power on the basis of consolidating the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and the victories of the Cultural Revolution are being continuously consolidated. The counter-revolutionary faces of the revisionists have been completely exposed, their positions have been thoroughly shaken, and the counter-revolutionary line has collapsed. This is of great significance for the socialist destiny of China.

The frenzied enemies of the People's Republic of China are sharpening their claws and fangs, hoping that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will fail and that China will restore capitalism. However, their hopes will not be realized, not now, not ever. Because the revolutionary masses firmly grasp the destiny of the revolution, the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, and the destiny of the socialist economy. While carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have implemented Chairman Mao's call: "Grasp revolution, promote production." Wherever we go, we have seen with our own eyes: China's economy has achieved great successes in all fields, labor is disciplined and organized, and the revolutionary optimism and high spirits of hundreds of millions of people. All this once again proves that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing to victory and is bringing new victories to all fields of China.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved these brilliant victories because the revolutionary masses have been mobilized. The revolutionary masses have been tempered in thought and have resolved to thoroughly smash the frenzied enemies of socialism and the revolution. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shows that the Communist Party of China has an invincible power, that the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has an invincible power, and that the creators of history - the masses of the people - have boundless power. A new generation of revolutionaries has been tempered in the fierce class struggle. They are the glorious successors of the revolutionary cause. They will ensure that the torch of Marxism-Leninism thought of Comrade Mao Zedong is passed on from generation to generation.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has great historical significance, not only for the socialist destiny of China but also for the socialist destiny and the destiny of the revolutionary cause of the world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has smashed the revisionist conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices and followers, avoiding the danger of China degenerating into capitalism, defending the fruits of socialist victory, and making China, this unshakeable stronghold of socialism, the revolutionary base of the world's people, even more firm and strong. It will march forward, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great example for the communists and people in countries ruled by the revisionist clique, showing them how to rise up in revolution, overthrow the revisionist clique, reestablish proletarian dictatorship, and return to the socialist path; it inspires the genuine communists within communist and workers' parties whose leadership has been usurped by revisionists and traitors, showing them how to overthrow the revisionist traitor leadership and lead their parties back to the true path of Marxism-Leninism; it greatly inspires the oppressed peoples of the world to fight for freedom from imperialist oppression; it inspires and greatly promotes the international proletariat's revolutionary struggle against capitalist and bourgeois oppression.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will push the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism, and support for the revolutionary and liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries to a new and higher stage.

The American imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists, based on the "sacred" Soviet-American alliance, have launched a frenzied wave of opposition to the People's Republic of China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique has become the chief culprit in slandering and defaming the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, manufacturing all the anti-China propaganda of the imperialist-revisionist alliance, aiming to prohibit the propagation of this great revolution to the Soviet people, to reduce its influence in the world. However, no matter what tricks the Khrushchev revisionists play, no force in the world can stop the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This victory is certain, it is inevitable.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an event of world historical significance. The most sacred domestic and international task of all the true revolutionaries in China is to unite their forces around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, strengthen unity under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line, eliminate local differences, adhere to the revolutionary direction, wage a sharp struggle against the ideological manifestations of class enemies - "selfishness," wage a struggle against putting personal and small group interests above collective interests, and not fall into the traps of the conspiracies of the bourgeois elements, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries who attempt to split the revolutionary ranks. Instead, they should unite as one, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The fundamental interests of the working class and all laboring masses are the same, their common enemy is the same, and their direction of struggle is the same, which is to strive for the victory of the revolutionary and communist cause. The contradictions within the laboring masses are non-antagonistic, and these contradictions should be and can be resolved on the basis of strengthening revolutionary unity. Only the enemy deliberately hopes to turn the contradictions within the people into antagonistic contradictions through various means to split the revolutionary ranks. Because the unity of the laboring masses is their death. Comrade Mao Zedong emphasizes: "The unity of the state, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause."

The unity we communists speak of is a fighting, revolutionary unity, not a unity without principles. The revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao are the only solid foundation for the great alliance of the Chinese laboring masses and all revolutionary factions. In the struggle against all enemies of China, in the struggle to strike down a handful of capitalist-roaders in power and the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, this unity is constantly expanding and consolidating. This unity has never been as strong as it is today. The great Chinese people, united under the red flag of Mao Zedong, with one heart and one mind, are using the fire of revolution to burn away all filth and poisonous weeds, to burn away all old and foreign things that do not conform to proletarian thought. They are transforming the objective and subjective worlds, effectively pushing forward the great socialist revolution and socialist construction of the People's Republic of China, making precious contributions to the common cause of the great world revolution, and becoming a shining example.

When imperialism, revisionism, and the world reactionaries are fiercely attacking China, attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the international duty of all Marxist-Leninists, all revolutionaries, and the people of the world is to spare no effort to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. To support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is to support the revolutionary forces of Comrade Mao Zedong, to support the revolutionary line and path of Comrade Mao Zedong, to ensure that the People's Republic of China remains forever red, forever as a stronghold of the world revolution and socialism, and to advance courageously.

The Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian Party members, and all the people have always been clear and firm in their support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, condemning the bourgeois revisionist conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev, supporting the proletarian revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong. They have stood and will always stand on the side of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, forming a great, unbreakable friendship with them.

Dear comrades, please allow me, on behalf of our Party and government and the Albanian people, to extend our congratulations to you, to the Communist Party of China, and to the great Chinese people. We wish you greater achievements in the struggle for the complete and thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the struggle for the victory of the socialist and communist cause under the guidance of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong.

Dear comrades:

Our country is located in the rear of the imperialist-revisionist alliance - on the distant Adriatic coast. The Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by our beloved founder and teacher, Comrade Enver Hoxha, with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other a gun, are striving to implement the decisions of the Fifth Party Congress, the ideological speech of Comrade Enver Hoxha on February 6 this year, and the important measures taken by the Party and government to further revolutionize our national life!

These revolutionary measures aim to further advance the socialist revolution in our country, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, raise the revolutionary class consciousness of our people, and ultimately block the channels for the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in Albania, ensuring that the revolutionary torch is reliably passed on from generation to generation. Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "Albania was born in revolution, Albania fights through revolution, and Albania achieved socialist victory through revolution. We will also enter communism through revolution."

Today, in the process of continuing the revolution, the struggle for socialist victory on the ideological front has special significance in our country. The bitter lessons of the Soviet Union and other revisionist-ruled countries show that without the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the ideological front, there is no guarantee of victory on the political and economic fronts of the socialist revolution.

Our laboring masses, following the Party's teachings, carrying out the slogan "think, work, and live like a revolutionary," have launched a great struggle on the ideological front, further establishing communist ideology and worldview, and realizing that further deepening the ideological revolution, constantly opposing bourgeois and revisionist thoughts, opposing the backward habits and religious superstitions left by the exploiting classes, is a primary task for our people living, working, and struggling under the conditions of being geographically surrounded by imperialist-revisionists for a long time.

In our laboring masses, a series of revolutionary movements and initiatives with profound ideological, political, economic, and social content have emerged. These many revolutionary movements show that our laboring masses strongly support the Party's revolutionary line, ensuring that Albania will never change its revolutionary color, will always advance on the socialist path, and will march towards communism.

The announcement of the Party Central Committee and the government on April 29 this year has launched a new high tide of further deepening these revolutionary movements and the creative initiatives of the laboring masses.

Under the leadership and education of the Party, the workers of our country, who have been tempered with proletarian thought, have a high level of class consciousness and revolutionary spirit, and have become a model for inspiring all laboring people. They influence the entire new life of our country, stand at the forefront of socialist construction, and set an example of heroic spirit and selflessness. Our people will never forget Adam Reka, Muhamet Shehu, Murtez Kepenjci, Qazim Hasmi, and many others who have put the collective interest above all else, fought against storms and fires, and sacrificed their lives to defend socialist property, dying heroically.

Our cooperative farmers realize that only by constantly strengthening socialist ownership can they guarantee their own and the people's well-being, always putting the collective interest above personal interest, with revolutionary enthusiasm, improving agricultural production through agricultural collectivization. A great activity to comprehensively develop rural, especially mountainous rural areas, is underway here.

Our heroic youth, carrying on the fighting traditions of their predecessors, enthusiastically respond to the Party's call, voluntarily launching a series of important activities to build socialism. These activities are a great school for the ideological revolution of the youth. In these activities, the youth have shown high fighting spirit, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the red flag of the Party. Our youth will forever hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's banner, and plant them on the peaks of socialism and communism.

In these revolutionary activities widely carried out in various parts of our country, our Party's Marxist-Leninist line, the mass line, is embodied. Our Party adheres to the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," striving to make the masses more consciously complete the grand tasks proposed by the historic Fifth Party Congress, further develop the fighting spirit and creativity in socialist construction based on the principle of self-reliance, to strive for even greater new victories, to ensure the continuous advancement of socialist construction, to forever block any possibility of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in Albania, to strengthen national defense, and to gloriously fulfill our internationalist duties.

The Party teaches us never to forget the internal danger of capitalist restoration, nor to forget the danger of possible imperialist intervention and aggression, not to lose revolutionary vigilance, not to be intoxicated by victory and stand still. The imperialists, Khrushchev, and Tito revisionists regard socialist Albania and the Albanian Labor Party as thorns in their eyes and try to make them submit. Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "This alliance is stirring, but we have been and are on high alert. We have fought with them and won, we are fighting with them and winning, and we will win in the future. Therefore, victory will surely be ours, belonging to our people and our Party."

Dear comrades, honorable friends:

The general international situation is excellent. It is favorable for revolution and socialism, for Marxism-Leninism, and for the revolutionary forces struggling for democracy and social liberation, and unfavorable for the enemies of Marxism-Leninism and the freedom of the peoples of all countries - imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism. The flourishing development of the national democratic liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America proves this, the irresistible struggle of the working class in all parts of the world proves this, the continuous growth of the Marxist-Leninist forces in all countries proves this. The revolutionary and progressive forces in various places are growing and advancing, while the imperialist-revisionist counter-revolutionary and reactionary forces are continuously declining. The insurmountable contradictions within the capitalist system and within the revisionist line are becoming increasingly sharp and pushing them to the brink of death.

The revolutionary people have more confidence, armed with weapons to fight against the American imperialists and their lackeys face to face. They are increasingly convinced that armed struggle of the people is the only reliable road to victory. The flames of armed struggle of the revolutionary peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning more fiercely. In the main centers of imperialism and international reaction, the United States, the tide of opposition to oppression and racial discrimination is rising. The people of the world who love freedom are waging more intense struggles against American imperialism and its running dogs, surrounding and dealing a fatal blow to this clay giant.

Although the current international situation is excellent, although imperialism is continuously losing its ruling positions in the world, it is proven that imperialism has not changed its ferocious and reactionary nature and aggressive nature, and the nature of the fundamental contradictions of the times has not changed and is constantly intensifying. On the contrary, the imperialism led by the United States, under the impact of the revolutionary waves in the world, at the moment of its impending death, is even more desperately pushing its infamous policy of aggression and war, trying every means to shackle the people of the world who love freedom with new and old colonialism, trying to stop the flourishing development of the revolutionary movement, trying to restore its lost positions. The most ferocious and dangerous common enemy standing in front of the peoples of all countries - American imperialism, waving the infamous anti-people and counter-revolutionary crusade flag, has become the pillar of neo-colonialism and the reactionaries of all countries, the greatest enemy of the peoples of all countries in the world.

American imperialism is rampant and sinful, but it receives strong help and support from the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The Soviet revisionist clique, following in the footsteps of its predecessor, the chief of revisionism, Nikita Khrushchev, is going further and further down the road of betraying Marxism-Leninism, betraying socialism, and betraying the interests of the peoples of all countries. It actively colludes with American imperialism to suppress the freedom of the peoples of all countries, opposes Marxism-Leninism and genuine revolutionaries. The following facts clearly illustrate this: The Johnson government and the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique, behind the heroic Vietnamese people, are engaged in dirty deals and transactions, trying to force the Vietnamese people to submit to the feet of the American imperialist invaders through the "peace talks" trick; the imperialists and Israel launch a criminal invasion against the peoples of the Arab countries, and the Soviet revisionist clique plays a shameful role; in Indonesia, they plotted a counter-revolutionary coup and created a white terror; they incited a hysterical anti-China chorus; they signed the draft of the "non-proliferation treaty" between the United States and the Soviet Union; the United States and the Soviet Union signed many agreements, the infamous meeting between the two heads of imperialism and revisionism, Johnson-Kosygin in Glassboro, and plotted new conspiracies. Despite the attempts of American imperialism and its ally, the Khrushchev revisionists, to create adventurous conspiracies, their ambition to bury the cause of socialism and revolution will not succeed. The peoples of all countries are not afraid, not discouraged, they are tempered in struggle, learn lessons, and strive for new victories. It can be fully believed that the just cause of the peoples of all countries, the revolutionary cause of the peoples of all countries, will surely win. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Struggle, defeat, struggle again, defeat again, struggle again, until victory - this is the logic of the people, and they will never deviate from this logic. This is another law of Marxism."

Today, the main target of the global strategy of American-Soviet cooperation is to oppose the great People's Republic of China, which is undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, because China, which is undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become a stronghold of socialism and world revolution. However, the evil plans of imperialism and modern revisionism to oppose socialism and the Chinese revolution will surely fail. Imperialism and modern revisionism will surely die, and the socialist and communist revolution will surely win in the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system, this is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will occur sooner or later and will surely win."

Dear comrades, honorable friends:

The great internationalist friendship and the fighting unity of Marxism-Leninism tightly bind our two peoples, two parties, and two countries together. Our great friendship is unbreakable by any storm, because it is built on the invincible foundation of Marxism-Leninism theory, on the foundation of proletarian internationalism. This friendship is forged by the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong in our struggle to build socialism and oppose our common enemies.

Our friendship and unity have profound revolutionary content, it is not limited by the geographical distance, whether in good times or in difficult times, our friendship and unity have shown their inexhaustible strength. The fraternal cooperation between our two countries and two parties embodies this unbreakable friendship and unity, and is becoming stronger day by day. The Albanian people and the great Chinese people stand on the same front, firmly fighting shoulder to shoulder against imperialism led by the United States, against colonialism and international reactionaries. They support each other and strongly support the national liberation movements of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, strongly support all progressive forces in the world struggling for national liberation and freedom. The Albanian Labor Party and the glorious Communist Party of China, unyielding and unyielding, bravely and firmly fight a principled struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, against the traitors of Marxism-Leninism, the Khrushchev revisionists. This exemplary struggle has become a great factor inspiring all revolutionary peoples and genuine Marxist-Leninists. All this is a great contribution of great historical significance to the international workers' movement and the communist movement. This is why the revolutionary peoples of the world and genuine Marxist-Leninists are infinitely delighted and inspired by the continuous strengthening and consolidation of our great friendship and unbreakable unity, while imperialism and revisionism are terrified by our iron-like friendship and unity.

A life full of struggle and sacrifice has educated the Albanian people to distinguish true friends from enemies. We Albanian people love our friends infinitely and hate our enemies infinitely.

The Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the Albanian government are proud to have the great Chinese people and the heroic Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong as their friends and loyal comrades-in-arms. Dear comrades, we assure you: the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party will forever be your comrades-in-arms and loyal allies. We will forever march forward with the great Chinese people and the great Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong in the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, for the complete victory of the socialist and communist cause in our two countries and in the world!

Let us further strengthen and consolidate our fighting unity and friendship!

Let us further strengthen the unity with all genuine Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples in the world, and march forward forever, until we completely defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Albania and China!

Long live the glorious Communist Party of China and its great leader, the honorable friend of the Albanian people, the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the heroic seven hundred million Chinese people, the builders of socialism, the brave fighters for the freedom of the world's people, the brave fighters for the cause of socialism and communism!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!

Long live all the people and proletarian revolutionaries of Hubei Province and Wuhan City!

Glory to the invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    无产阶级文化大革命是毛主席亲自发动和领导的，你们进行这场革命的斗争，具有十分重大的意义。忠于中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志及其革命路线的武汉左派革命力量，揭露和粉碎了党和人民的敌人企图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级反动路线，勇敢地捍卫了毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义路线，加强了无产阶级专政。武汉革命工人同革命学生和人民解放军互相支持互相鼓舞，紧密地团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。这样他们在自己的光荣历史上写下了以毛主席为代表的革命路线的新的伟大胜利。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命是中华人民共和国成立十八年来，中国人民的最伟大的事件。这场伟大革命的根本问题是国家政权问题。在无产阶级掌权的社会主义国家里政权问题仍然是革命的根本问题。资产阶级修正主义分子窃取党和国家重要职位，并企图把中国从社会主义道路拉回资本主义道路这一事实，决定了这场伟大革命的历史需要。这场革命证明了关于社会主义国家在从资本主义过渡到共产主义整个历史时期内存在着阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争，存在着产生修正主义和复辟资本主义危险的马克思列宁主义的原则性的论点。
      中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场席卷包括政治、思想、文化、经济、军事和外交等生活各个领域的全面的革命。首先，它是一场人们思想的大革命，是一场改造人们思想，使人的思想革命化，清除旧世界的一切污泥浊水，争取无产阶级的思想、道德和文化以及毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想彻底胜利的大革命。它是一场决定中华人民共和国在思想领域内“谁战胜谁”是社会主义还是资本主义的大革命。
    无产阶级文化大革命发动了亿万中国人民群众，再一次证明了这样的一个马克思列宁主义的论点，即：只有在共产党领导的群众的大民主条件下，吸收群众参加管理国家事务，确立群众对党、国家和经济部门以及各级干部的监督，才能避免反革命修正主义集团篡夺政权的危险，才能保卫无产阶级专政，推进社会主义事业。
    在共产党领导下，在毛泽东思想红旗指引下团结起来的广大工、农、兵、革命学生、革命干部和革命知识分子是无产阶级文化大革命的动力。这一团结的基础是革命群众组织，人民解放军部队和革命领导干部的战斗的三结合。红卫兵是无产阶级文化大革命的先锋，红卫兵运动是无产阶级文化大革命的产物，是在中国条件下革命青年的新的组织形式。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场按照中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的革命学说和思想进行的革命。毛泽东同志是一位伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他紧密地结合中国革命和中国社会主义建设以及国际共产主义和革命运动发展的实践，过去和现在为保卫和进一步发展马克思列宁主义作出了杰出的贡献。
    中国人民以高度的热情响应毛泽东同志的亲密战友林彪副主席的号召，“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”中国广大人民群众学习和运用毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，是一项使占世界人口四分之一的亿万人民的思想和世界观革命化的伟大运动。
    目前，中国无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部之间在政治上的阶级大搏斗，是社会主义同反革命之间生死决战。因此，无产阶级革命派的闯将们要一致动员起来，粉碎以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的反革命修正主义大阴谋。中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图在中国实现的，就是他的难友尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫在苏联实现的那一套东西。
    中共八届十一中全会具有历史意义的决议，进一步促进了无产阶级文化大革命的开展。全会决议的实质，体现在毛泽东同志的《炮打司令部》的大字报里，这是在社会主义和资本主义两条路线残酷斗争的关键时刻发表的。这张大字报表现了革命群众对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，就是这些敌人妄图扼杀革命事业，推翻无产阶级专政，在中国建立资产阶级专政。
    我们十分高兴地看到现在无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新的阶段。革命组织在需要夺权的地方，在巩固大联合和三结合的基础上夺权后，文化革命的胜利成果正在不断巩固。修正主义者的反革命面目暴露无遗，他们的阵地彻底动摇，反革命阵线全线崩溃。这些对于中国的社会主义命运，具有极其重大的意义。
    人民中国的疯狂的敌人，磨拳擦掌，他们希望中国的无产阶级文化大革命失败，中国会复辟资本主义。但是，他们的希望不会实现，永远也不会实现。因为革命群众牢牢地掌握了革命的命运、无产阶级专政的命运和社会主义经济的命运。他们在进行无产阶级文化大革命的同时，实现了毛主席的号召：“抓革命，促生产”。我们所到之处亲眼看到：中国经济在各个领域里都获得巨大成就，劳动有纪律、有组织，亿万人民群众的革命乐观情绪和意气风发，这一切再一次证明，无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利前进，同时给中国各个领域带来新的胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命取得这些辉煌的胜利，是因为革命群众都发动起来了。革命群众在思想上得到了锻炼，他们下定决心，彻底粉碎社会主义和革命事业的疯狂的敌人。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，表明中国共产党有无比强大的力量，表明马克思列宁主义的不朽学说和毛泽东思想有无比强大的力量，表明历史的创造者——人民群众具有无穷无尽的力量。一代革命新人在严峻的阶级斗争中得到了锻炼。他们是革命事业的光荣的接班人。他们将保证毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的火炬世代相传。
    无产阶级文化大革命的胜利具有巨大的历史意义，这不仅对中国的社会主义命运是如此，对全世界的社会主义命运和革命事业的命运也是如此。
    无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其伙伴和追随者的修正主义阴谋，避免了中国蜕化为资本主义的危险，保卫了社会主义胜利果实，使中国这个社会主义的坚不可摧的强大堡垒、世界人民的革命根据地更坚定、更强固，它将高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜勇往直前。无产阶级文化大革命是修正主义集团统治的国家的共产党人和人民的伟大榜样，告诉他们如何起来革命，推翻修正主义集团，重新建立无产阶级专政，重新回到社会主义的道路上来；它鼓舞着被修正主义和叛徒篡夺了领导权的共产党和工人党内的真正的共产党人，告诉他们如何起来推翻修正主义的叛徒领导，使他们的党重新走上真正的马克思列宁主义的道路；它大大地鼓舞全世界被压迫人民起来，从帝国主义的压迫下争取自由；它鼓舞并大大地促进国际工人阶级反对资本主义和资产阶级压迫的革命。
    无产阶级文化大革命将中国共产党和中国人民的反对帝国主义、反对反动派和现代修正主义、支持各国人民的革命和解放斗争，推向更高的新阶段。
    美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，根据苏美“神圣”同盟，掀起了疯狂的反对中华人民共和国和中国无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮。勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团成了诬蔑和诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命的罪魁祸首，制造帝修的一切反华宣传的造谣公司，目的是禁止向苏联人民宣传这场大革命，以减少它在世界上的影响。但是，不管赫鲁晓夫修正主义者搞什么名堂，世界上没有任何力量能阻挡中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。这个胜利是肯定的，是必然的。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一个具有世界历史意义的事件，全中国真正的革命派的最崇高的国内国际任务是将队伍联合在中国共产党和毛主席周围，并在无产阶级革命路线的指引下加强团结，消除局部分歧，坚持革命大方向，进行一场反对阶级敌人的思想意识的表现——“私”字的尖锐斗争，进行一场反对把个人和小团体的利益放在整体利益之上的斗争，不要掉到资产阶级分子，修正主义分子和反革命分子企图分裂革命队伍的阴谋诡计的陷井中去，而应该团结得象一个人一样，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛泽东同志说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”工人阶级和一切劳动群众的根本利益是一致的，他们的共同敌人也是一致的，他们的斗争大方向也是一致的，这就是，争取革命和共产主义事业的胜利。劳动群众的内部矛盾是非对抗性的，这些矛盾应当而且能够在加强革命团结的基础上去解决。只有敌人处心积虑地希望通过种种手段使人民内部矛盾变成对抗性的矛盾，以便分裂革命队伍。因为劳动群众的团结，就是他们的死亡。毛泽东同志强调：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    我们共产党员所讲的团结，是战斗的革命的团结，而不是没有原则的形式的团结，毛泽东同志代表的革命路线和毛主席的马克思列宁主义的伟大思想就是中国劳动群众和一切革命派大联合唯一坚强的基础。在与中国的一切敌人的斗争中，在打击一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和中国的赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动黑线的斗争中，这一团结正在不断扩大和巩固。这一团结，任何时候也没有象今天这样强大。伟大的中国人民，团结在毛泽东的红旗下，万众一心，正在用革命之火，烧掉一切污垢和毒草，烧毁一切不符合无产阶级思想的旧的洋的东西。正在改造客观世界和主观世界，卓有成效地把伟大的人民中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业推向前进，在伟大的世界革命的共同事业中做出十分珍贵的贡献，成为光辉的榜样。
    当帝国主义、修正主义和世界反动派正在疯狂地攻击中国、攻击无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东同志的时候，一切马克思列宁主义者，一切革命者和世界人民的国际义务就是竭尽全力支援中国的无产阶级文化大革命。你支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命，就是说你支持毛泽东同志的革命力量，支持毛泽东同志的革命路线和道路，使人民中国永远鲜红，永远做为世界革命和社会主义的强大堡垒，奋勇前进。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，阿尔巴尼亚党员和全体人民的态度过去和现在一直是明确和坚定地支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，谴责中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级修正主义阴谋，支持毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线，他们过去和将来永远站在中国共产党和中国人民一边，同他们结成伟大的、牢不可破的友谊。
    亲爱的同志们：请允许我代表我们党和我国政府，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民向你们，向中国共产党和伟大的中国人民表示祝贺，祝你们在争取无产阶级文化大革命的完全彻底胜利的斗争中，在中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志指引的道路上，争取社会主义和共产主义事业胜利的斗争中，取得越来越大的成就。
    亲爱的同志们：
    我国处于帝修同盟的后方——遥远的亚得里亚海滨。阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以我们敬爱的创始人和导师恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，为贯彻党的第五次代表大会的决议，霍查同志今年二月六日纲领性讲话的思想以及党和政府为使我国国家生活进一步革命化所采取的重要措施而努力奋斗！
    这些革命化措施旨在进一步在我国开展社会主义革命，加强无产阶级专政，提高我国人民的革命阶级觉悟，以最终堵塞在阿尔巴尼亚产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的通道，使革命的接力棒可靠地代代相传。恩维尔·霍查同志说：“阿尔巴尼亚在革命中诞生，阿尔巴尼亚通过革命进行斗争，通过革命取得了社会主义的胜利。我们也将通过革命进入共产主义”。
    今天，在革命继续发展的过程中，在思想战线上争取社会主义胜利的斗争在我国具有特殊意义。苏联以及其他修正主义当权的国家的惨痛教训表明，思想战线上的社会主义革命不取得彻底胜利，政治和经济战线上的社会主义革命胜利就没有保证。
    我国劳动群众遵循党的这些教导，执行“象革命者一样思考、工作和生活”的口号，投入到思想战线上的巨大斗争中去，进一步树立共产主义思想和世界观，并意识到进一步深入开展思想革命，不断反对资产阶级和修正主义思想，反对剥削阶级遗留下来的落后习惯和宗教迷信，对于在地理上被帝修包围条件下生活、工作和斗争的我国人民来说，在很长时期内仍将是一项首要任务。
    在我国劳动群众中出现了一系列具有深刻的思想、政治、经济和社会内容的革命运动和倡议。这许多革命运动表明，我国劳动群众有力地拥护党的革命路线，以保证阿尔巴尼亚永远不改变革命的颜色，永远在社会主义道路上前进，并奔向共产主义。
    今年四月二十九日党中央和政府的公告，掀起了进一步深入开展这些革命运动和劳动群众创造性倡议的新高潮。
    在党的领导和教育下，用无产阶级思想进行锻炼，具有高度阶级觉悟和革命精神的我国工人阶级成了鼓舞全体劳动人民的榜样。它影响着我国的全部新生活，站在社会主义建设的最前列，树立了英雄气概和忘我精神的榜样。我国人民将永远不会忘记亚当·雷卡，穆哈梅特·希胡，穆尔特扎·凯皮，恰齐姆·哈斯米等许多人，他们把整体利益放在一切之上，同风暴和烈火进行搏斗，为了保卫社会主义财产，以身殉职，象英雄一样献出了自己的生命。
    我国合作社农民，意识到只有不断加强社会主义所有制，才能保证他们自己和全民的福利，始终把整体利益放在个人利益之上，以革命的干劲，通过农业集体化提高农业产量。在我们这里正在开展全面发展农村，特别是山区农村的巨大活动。
    我国英雄的青年，发扬先辈们的战斗传统，热烈响应党的号召，自愿开展了一系列建设社会主义的重要活动。这些活动是对青年进行思想革命锻炼的大学校。在这些活动中，青年表现了高度的战斗精神，高举马列主义旗帜，党的红旗。我国青年将永远高举马列主义旗帜，党的旗帜，并把它们插上社会主义和共产主义的高峰。
    在我国各地广泛开展的这些革命活动中，体现了我们党的马列主义路线，即群众路线。我们党遵循“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则，努力使群众更自觉地完成党的历史性的第五次代表大会提出的宏伟任务，在社会主义建设中根据自力更生原则更进一步发扬战斗精神和发挥创造性，以争取更加伟大的新胜利，保证不断进行社会主义建设，永远堵塞在阿尔巴尼亚产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的任何可能，巩固国防，光荣地完成我们的国际主义义务。
    党教导我们千万不要忘记资本主义复辟的内部危险，也不要忘记帝国主义可能的干涉和侵略的危险，不要丧失革命的警惕，不要被胜利冲昏头脑，停止不前。帝国主义者，赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义者把社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党看成眼中钉，并企图使他们屈服。恩维尔·霍查同志说：“这个联盟在蠢蠢欲动，但是我们过去和现在都严阵以待。我们同他们较量过，并取得了胜利，现在又同他们较量，又在取得胜利，以后也将是如此。所以胜利必将属于我们，属于我国人民和我们的党。”
    亲爱的同志们，尊贵的朋友们：
    总的国际形势一片大好。它有利于革命和社会主义，有利于马列主义以及正在为争取民主和社会解放而斗争的革命力量，而不利于马列主义和各国人民自由的敌人——帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义。亚、非、拉民族民主解放运动的蓬勃发展证明了这一点，世界各地工人阶级势不可挡的斗争也证明了这一点，世界各国马列主义队伍的不断壮大证明了这一点。各地的革命进步力量已在壮大，向前迈进，而帝国主义修正主义一切反革命反动势力正在不断衰亡。资本主义体系内部以及修正主义阵线内部的不可克服的矛盾越来越尖锐，并使其濒于死亡。
    革命人民有更加坚定的信心，手执武器同美帝国主义者及其仆从进行针锋相对的斗争。他们越来越坚信人民武装斗争是争取胜利的唯一可靠的道路。亚、非、拉革命人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺。在帝国主义和国际反动派主要中心的美国，反对压迫和种族隔离的怒潮正在兴起。世界各地爱好自由的人民正在开展更加激烈的斗争，反对美帝国主义及其走狗，他们包围了并正在给予这个泥足怪物以致命打击。
    虽然目前的国际形势一片大好，虽然帝国主义不断失去它在世界的统治阵地，事实证明，帝国主义一点也没有改变它的穷凶极恶的反动本性和侵略本性，当代基本矛盾的性质也一点没有改变，并且不断加剧。相反，以美国为首的帝国主义，在世界各地革命浪潮的冲击下，在它临近死亡的关头，更加紧推行其臭名远扬的侵略政策和战争政策，千方百计企图给世界上热爱自由的人民套上新老殖民主义的枷锁，妄图阻挡革命运动的蓬勃发展，妄图恢复其失去的阵地。站在各国人民面前的最凶恶、最危险的共同敌人——美帝国主义，打起臭名远扬的反人民反革命十字军的旗帜，成为新殖民主义和各国反动派的支柱，成为全世界各国人民最大的敌人。
    美帝国主义横行霸道，罪恶滔天，但却得到苏修统治集团的大力帮助和支持。苏修集团步其先师——修正主义的主帅尼·赫鲁晓夫的后尘，在背叛马列主义、背叛社会主义和背叛各国人民利益的道路上愈走愈远。它积极伙同美帝国主义，压制各国人民的自由，反对马列主义和真正的革命者。下面的事实清楚地说明了这一点：约翰逊政府和勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团，背着英雄的越南人民，正在进行肮脏的勾当和交易，企图通过“和谈”诡计，迫使越南人民屈服于美帝侵略者的脚下；帝国主义和以色列对阿拉伯各国人民发动罪恶的侵略，苏修集团扮演了可耻的角色；在印度尼西亚策划反革命政变，制造白色恐怖；煽起歇斯底里的反华大合唱；签定美苏“防止核扩散”条约草案；美苏之间签订了许多协定，帝国主义、修正主义两个头目约翰逊—柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的臭名昭彰的会晤，并策划新的阴谋计划。美帝国主义及其盟友赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，尽管力图制造阴谋冒险活动，但他们要葬送社会主义和革命事业的霸权目的是不会得逞的。各国人民不害怕，不气馁，他们在斗争中得到锻炼，吸取教训，争取新的胜利。完全可以相信，各国人民的正义事业，各国人民的革命事业必将胜利。毛泽东同志说：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是马克思主义的又一条定律。”
    今天，美苏合作的全球战略的主要矛头是反对毛泽东的伟大的人民中国，因为正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国，已经成为社会主义和世界革命的强大堡垒。但是，帝国主义、修正主义反华，反对社会主义革命的罪恶计划，必将彻底失败。帝国主义和现代修正主义一定死亡，社会主义和共产主义革命必将在全世界胜利。毛泽东同志说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    亲爱的同志们，尊贵的朋友们：
    伟大的国际主义的友谊和马克思列宁主义的战斗团结，把我们两国人民、两党和两个国家紧密地连结在一起，我们的伟大友谊是任何惊涛骇浪也破坏不了的，因为它是建筑在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义理论基础上的，是建筑在无产阶级国际主义基础上的。这个友谊是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党在我们建设社会主义和反对我们的共同敌人的斗争中缔造的。
    我们的友谊和团结有着深刻的革命内容，它是不受地理上的遥远距离所限制的，无论是在美好的日子里还是在困难的时刻，我们的友谊和团结都表现了它的源源不绝的强大力量。我们两国、两党间的兄弟般的合作关系体现了这一牢不可破的友谊和团结，并正在日益增强。阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民站在同一条战线上，为反对以美帝为首的帝国主义、反对殖民主义和国际反动派而坚定地并肩战斗。他们团结在一起，并且有力地支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲革命人民的民族解放运动，有力地支持世界上一切为争取民族解放和自由而斗争的进步力量。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和光荣的中国共产党坚强不屈地高举革命大旗，为捍卫马列主义的纯洁性，为反对马克思列宁主义的叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，勇敢、坚定地进行着原则性的斗争。这一范例性的斗争，成为鼓舞一切革命人民和真正的马克思列宁主义者的强大因素。这一切是对国际工人运动和共产主义运动具有重大历史意义的巨大贡献。这就是为什么世界革命人民和真正马克思列宁主义者对我们的伟大友谊和牢不可破的团结的不断加强和巩固感到无限欢欣鼓舞，而帝国主义、修正主义对我们的钢铁般的友谊和团结感到惊恐万分的原因。
    充满了斗争和牺牲的生活本身教育了阿尔巴尼亚人民，使他们分清真正的朋友和敌人，我们阿尔巴尼亚人民无限地热爱自己的朋友，同样也无限地憎恨自己的敌人。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府，为有伟大的中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的英雄的中国共产党作为自己生死与共的朋友和忠实的战友，感到骄傲。亲爱的同志们，我们向你们保证：阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将永远是你们的战友和忠实的盟国。我们将永远同毛泽东同志的伟大的中国人民和伟大的中国共产党在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派，争取社会主义事业和共产主义事业在我们两国和全世界的彻底胜利而并肩前进！
    让我们进一步加强和巩固我们的战斗团结和友谊！
    让我们进一步加强同世界上一切真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的团结，永远向前进，直到彻底打败帝国主义、修正主义和反动派！
    阿中两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党及其伟大的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民尊贵的朋友、伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志万岁！
    社会主义建设者、世界人民自由的英勇战士、社会主义和共产主义事业的英勇战士、兄弟的七亿中国人民万岁！
    中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    湖北省和武汉市全体人民和无产阶级革命派万岁！
    光荣属于战无不胜的马克思列宁主义！
