In the great turmoil of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army has persisted in "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism." The army's movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works has reached a new level, and the construction of the army's revolutionary and combat readiness has entered a brilliant new era.

Advanced units and individuals in the army who study and apply Chairman Mao's works have emerged in large numbers. Tens of thousands of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are rapidly growing. Our great Wall of our great motherland is stronger, more solid, and invincible.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on October 3rd, our reporter comments: In the great new era of Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, along with the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has entered a new stage, created a new situation, achieved new victories, and reached a new level.

During this period, all soldiers and officers of the entire army have thrown themselves into the revolutionary movement of hundreds of millions of people. In the great storms of class struggle, they have extensively studied, memorized, lectured on, and applied Chairman Mao's works. Their class feelings for Mao Zedong Thought have never been as deep as they are today, the atmosphere of study has never been as thick, the posture of criticizing the self and establishing the public has never been as high, their understanding of the proletarian dictatorship has never been as profound, and their revolutionary spirit has never been as ardent. The army is producing heroes, and advanced units and individuals who study and apply Chairman Mao's works are emerging in large numbers. Old models have new developments, and new models have new manifestations. Tens of thousands of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are rapidly growing. The revolutionary and combat readiness construction of the People's Liberation Army has entered a more brilliant new historical period. Our great Wall of our great motherland is stronger, more solid, and invincible than ever before.

The People's Liberation Army's mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works was launched under the personal leadership of Vice Chairman Lin Biao. Over the past few years, Vice Chairman Lin Biao has given a series of instructions to the entire army on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that this great mass movement has always been carried out on an unprecedented scale and with unyielding momentum, progressing step by step and rolling forward. The entire army has improved year by year in studying well and applying actively, achieving great results and good effects. Last year, Chairman Mao, in the "May 7th Directive," issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school. Vice Chairman Lin Biao, in light of the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the entire Party and nation studying Chairman Mao's works, timely issued the call to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. He demanded of the entire army: The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought must be held higher than ever before. The study of Chairman Mao's works must be further grasped and more concretely implemented, creating a new situation and reaching a new level. This call quickly spread throughout the army, and the broad masses of soldiers and officers unanimously agreed that this was Vice Chairman Lin Biao's greatest political concern for the entire army's cadres and soldiers in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was the order to mobilize the entire army to run the great school of Mao Zedong Thought well and the battle cry for advancing. It was the guiding light for the entire army to advance rapidly along a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready course.

Over the past year, the army, navy, and air force units have, in the front lines of defending the motherland, in the work of safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, with great enthusiasm, high awareness, and great determination, promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The greatest characteristic of this new stage is that the entire army has focused on studying Chairman Mao's great theory on conducting revolution under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, insisting on learning and applying in struggle, regarding the execution and defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the highest duty, and generally shifting from focusing on solving specific problems to focusing on solving major issues of politics, direction, and line. They have grasped three fundamentals: firmly grasping the fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; consistently adhering to the fundamental method of learning and applying in struggle; and firmly holding onto the fundamental goal of criticizing the self and establishing the public, thoroughly transforming the worldview. They have reached three heights: the broad masses of soldiers and officers' feelings of infinite love, loyalty, faith, and worship for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line have reached a new height; their class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle have reached a new height; and their work of criticizing the self and establishing the public, and the revolutionary transformation of their thinking, has reached a new height.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past year, various units have, to make the soldiers and officers have an attitude of infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought and a determination to defend it to the death, repeatedly organized the study of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instruction, universally launching a great praise of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; and a great criticism of China's Khrushchev and his bourgeois reactionary line, making everyone deeply realize that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Whether to support or oppose Mao Zedong Thought, whether to love or hate it, is a fundamental stance issue. Many units' leading cadres have gone deep into the companies, through their personal experiences of following Chairman Mao in making revolution, praising Chairman Mao's great contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and condemning China's Khrushchev's continuous anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes. Many units have also mobilized the masses to, through comparing the earth-shaking changes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over more than a year, extensively speak and display the great situation and brilliant achievements of the Cultural Revolution, greatly praising Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as being extremely wise, extremely great, and extremely correct, greatly enhancing the broad masses of cadres and soldiers' deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao.

The soldiers and officers working on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries" have, from their personal experiences, deeply felt that Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and principle on conducting revolution under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship are a great development of Marxism-Leninism. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is especially necessary to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly executing those understood and temporarily not understood, understanding in the process of execution, in order to keep up with Chairman Mao and do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, being loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said: "Going to the battlefield, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to be brave; fighting the enemy, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to win; being a soldier defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, using Mao Zedong Thought to redden one's heart." Many soldiers and officers have studied to defend the proletarian dictatorship and to defend Mao Zedong Thought. No matter what difficulties they encounter or what dangers they face, they have shown an infinite loyalty to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. They said: "The head can be cut off, blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned; the sea can dry up, stones can rot, but the red heart defending Chairman Mao will never change." Eleven soldiers of a certain unit were burned in a battle to extinguish a major fire threatening the country's forest resources. They still insisted on reading Chairman Mao's books and propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the hospital to serve the people. Many units have used Chairman Mao's quotations to command battles. The soldiers and officers scattered on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries," no matter how tense the struggle is, have, like in their companies, made the first thing every morning saluting Chairman Mao's portrait, bringing the day's work problems to consult Chairman Mao's works; in the evening, bringing the day's work problems to study Chairman Mao's works, check and compare, report to Chairman Mao, requiring themselves not to deviate from Chairman Mao's guidance for a single moment. They said: "We are thousands of miles away from Beijing, but we are never apart from Chairman Mao." They have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, regarding Chairman Mao's latest instructions as orders to be followed, striving to achieve "Chairman Mao loves me, I love; Chairman Mao supports me, I support; Chairman Mao praises me, I praise; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow."

Chairman Mao teaches us: The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation. The broad masses of soldiers and officers have, in the practical struggle, deeply realized that Chairman Mao's teaching is a great truth. They said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest and deepest revolution in human history. In such a great and profound revolutionary movement, everyone must put "public" first, placing the transformation of worldview in the first position, raising the level of criticizing the self and establishing the public. This is the fundamental purpose of our studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They said: "In this fiery class struggle, the problems encountered are the sharpest, the ideological struggle is the most intense, the soul is touched the deepest, and the things learned are the most solid." To achieve this fundamental purpose, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have, in their studies, emphasized grasping the "line," "line," and "view," insisting on "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism." That is, taking the struggle between the two lines as the key, consciously placing oneself in the struggle between the two lines, bringing problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticizing the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and at the same time, cleansing the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line from everyone's ideology, overcoming bourgeois ideology, transforming the soul, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" This "end" is in everyone's mind, insisting on "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism," solving the problem of worldview. "Criticizing the self and opposing revisionism" are interconnected. Only by thoroughly criticizing the "self," can the struggle against revisionism be carried through to the end. Some units have also summarized this new experience of study as: "Finding problems in the struggle of lines, finding answers in Chairman Mao's works, finding reasons in the depths of the soul, and seeing effects in actions." In this way, they have consciously raised the struggle of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and transforming the worldview from the personal scope to the political domain of the struggle between the two lines; the thought of serving the people has been raised from just focusing on working hard and helping others to consciously supporting and defending the proletarian revolutionary faction's seizure, use, and holding of power; criticizing the self and establishing the public has also been raised from struggling with general specific problems to struggling in firmly upholding revolutionary principles.

They regard the infinite love, loyalty, faith, and worship for the great leader Chairman Mao as the greatest public; regard being loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the greatest public; regard always caring about state affairs, world affairs, and people's affairs as the greatest public; regard firmly following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasping the direction of struggle, and insisting on carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end as the greatest public. They said: "Criticizing the self and establishing the public grasps the key, state affairs are in the heart, the stance is firm and the vision is broad, firmly grasping the great direction."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Studying Marxism, not only from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and approaching the workers and peasants, can truly learn." Over the past year, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have, following Chairman Mao's teaching, walked out of the barracks and thrown themselves into the fiery struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studying Mao Zedong Thought, and undergone an unprecedented test and tempering in the history of the army's construction. Many units have, in the complex class struggle, learned, grasped, and applied Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation, implement policies, and decide actions, learning to a new level, applying to a new level, establishing new merits, and creating new experiences. They have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people," launching revolutionary great criticism, and implementing revolutionary great unity, on the vast front lines of the "three supports, two militaries," together with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, directing the spearhead of struggle at the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching revolutionary great criticism, promoting revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and in the struggle, firmly grasping the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying Wrong Ideas in the Party" as mottos to study, repeatedly studying and repeatedly comparing, firmly grasping, and not leaving for a moment. Some units have, in the "three supports, two militaries" work, had shortcomings and errors, and have, following Chairman Mao's instruction on "carrying out open, mass self-criticism (each aspect only criticizes itself, not the other side), and thoroughly correcting it," consciously raised the problem to the key of the struggle between the two lines, practiced the spirit of daring to criticize oneself, strictly demanded of oneself, checked with the masses, and quickly corrected. Everyone has generally felt that learning class struggle viewpoints in the class struggle classroom, learning mass viewpoints on the spot of the mass movement, learning the thought of serving the people in the process of serving the people, and learning the theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people in the complex intertwining of the two types of contradictions, is the most practical, the most profound in understanding, the most reliable in remembering, the more one studies the more one wants to study, and the more one studies the less one can put down. Some said: The things learned in the classroom of class struggle are the most solid, and the "students" graduating from it can withstand the greatest test.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers, while joyfully reviewing the great situation and rich experiences of extensively studying the revolutionary treasure book Chairman Mao's works over the past year, pointed out with revolutionary enthusiasm that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought must be held higher and higher; the study of Chairman Mao's works must be grasped more and more tightly; and the ideological revolutionization of the units must be strengthened and strengthened again.

    在无产阶级文化大革命的大风浪中坚持“斗私，批修”
    解放军活学活用毛主席著作达到新水平  革命化战斗化建设进入光辉灿烂新时期
    部队中活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位和先进人物大量涌现，千千万万无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线的无产阶级革命事业接班人，正在迅速成长起来。我们伟大祖国的伟大长城更加坚强，更加巩固，更加无敌于天下。
    据新华社三日讯　本社记者述评：在世界进入毛泽东思想的伟大新时代，中国人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，随着汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大洪流向前发展，深入开展“斗私，批修”斗争，又跨入了一个新的阶段，出现了新局面，取得了新胜利，创造了新经验，提高到了新的水平。
    这期间，全军指战员，投身于亿万革命群众运动之中，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，大学、大背、大讲、大用毛主席著作，对毛泽东思想的阶级感情，从来没有象今天这样深，学习空气从来没有象今天这样浓，破私立公的姿态从来没有象今天这样高，对无产阶级专政的认识从来没有象今天这样深刻，革命斗志从来没有象今天这样昂扬。部队里，英雄辈出，活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位和先进人物大量涌现，老典型有新发展，新典型有新表现，千千万万无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，正在迅速成长起来。人民解放军的革命化、战斗化建设，已经进入了一个更加光辉灿烂的新的历史时期。我们伟大祖国的伟大长城，比以往任何时候都更加坚强、更加巩固、更加天下无敌。
    人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，是在林彪副主席亲自领导下蓬勃开展起来的。几年来，林彪副主席对全军活学活用毛主席著作作了一系列指示，使这一伟大的群众运动，始终以空前壮阔的规模，永盛不衰的气势，步步深入，滚滚向前。全军上下一年比一年学得好，用得活，成绩大，效果好。去年，毛主席在“五·七”指示中发出了“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召。林彪副主席根据无产阶级文化大革命和全党全国学习毛主席著作已经出现新形势的新情况，又适时向全军发出了“把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段”的号召。他要求全军：毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一定要比过去举得更高。毛主席著作的学习，一定要进一步抓紧，更讲究落实，要出现新的局面，提高到新的水平。这一号召，迅速传遍全军，广大指战员一致认为，这是林彪副主席在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，对全军干部战士的最大政治关怀，是指挥全军办好毛泽东思想大学校的动员令、进军号，是指引全军沿着非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化航道高速前进的导航灯。
    一年来，陆海空三军各部队，在保卫祖国的战斗前线，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命和执行“三支”“两军”任务的工作中，都以极大的热情，极高的自觉，很大的毅力，推动全军活学活用毛主席著作群众运动向着新阶段前进。这个新阶段的最大的特点，就是全军上下，着重学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的伟大理论，坚持在斗争中学，在斗争中用，把执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线作为最崇高的职责，普遍由过去比较注意解决一般具体问题，上升到了着重解决政治、方向、路线等大节问题。他们狠抓三个“根本”：狠狠抓住对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本态度；始终坚持在斗争中学，斗争中用的根本方法；紧紧掌握达到破私立公、彻底改造世界观的根本目的。达到了三个“高度”，这就是广大指战员对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的感情，提高到了一个新的高度；阶级斗争观念和路线斗争的觉悟，提高到了一个新的高度；破私立公，思想革命化的建设，提高到了一个新的高度。
    林彪副主席说：对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。过去一年里，各部队为了使指战员具有无限热爱毛泽东思想，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想的态度，反复组织大家学习林彪副主席这一指示，普遍开展了对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的大颂扬；对中国赫鲁晓夫及其资产阶级反动路线的大批判，使大家深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是中国人民和世界人民的命根子。对毛泽东思想是拥护还是反对，是热爱还是仇视，是个根本立场问题。许多部队的领导干部深入连队，通过自己跟随毛主席闹革命的亲身经历，颂扬毛主席对中国革命和世界革命的伟大贡献，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。许多部队还发动群众，通过对比无产阶级文化大革命一年多来翻天覆地的变化，大讲大摆文化大革命的大好形势和辉煌成果，大赞大颂毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无比英明、无比伟大、无比正确，大大增强了广大干部战士对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情。
    在“三支”“两军”第一线上工作的指战员，从亲身经历中深深体会到，毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，是马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。在无产阶级文化大革命中，特别要注意活学活用毛主席的这些最新指示，理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在执行中再去理解，才能跟上毛主席，做好“三支”“两军”工作，忠于毛主席的革命路线。他们说：“上战场，靠的是毛泽东思想壮胆；斗敌人，靠的是毛泽东思想取胜；当捍卫毛主席革命路线的战士，就要用毛泽东思想把自己的心染红”。许多指战员为保卫无产阶级专政而学，为捍卫毛泽东思想而学，不论遇到什么困难，面临何种险境，都表现了誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚。他们说：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢；海可枯，石可烂，保卫毛主席的红心永不变。”某部十一名战士在扑灭一场危及祖国森林资源的大火的战斗中被烧伤。他们在医院里仍然坚持读毛主席的书，宣传毛泽东思想，为人民服务。不少部队用毛主席语录指挥作战。分散在“三支”“两军”第一线的指战员，不管斗争多么紧张，都和在连队一样，每天早起第一件事是向毛主席像致敬，带着一天将要进行的工作问题，向毛主席著作请示；晚上，带着一天工作问题，学习毛主席著作，检查对照，向毛主席汇报，要求自己一分一秒也不离开毛主席指引的航道。他们说：“我们离北京千山万水，跟毛主席寸步不离。”他们坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，对毛主席的最新指示，坚决照办，努力做到“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席称赞我称赞，毛主席指示我照办。”
    毛主席教导我们：世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。广大指战员在斗争实践中，深刻地认识到，毛主席这一教导，是一个伟大的真理。他们说，无产阶级文化大革命是人类历史上最伟大最深刻的一次革命，在这样伟大深刻的革命运动中，每一个人都必须“公”字当头，把世界观的改造放在第一位，把破私立公提高到一个新的境界。这是我们活学活用毛主席著作的根本目的。他们说：“在这场火热的阶级斗争中，遇到的问题最尖锐，思想斗争最激烈，触及灵魂最深刻，学到的东西最过硬。”为了达到这个根本目的，广大指战员在学习中突出地抓“纲”抓“线”抓“观”，坚持“斗私，批修”。就是以两条路线斗争为纲，自觉地把自己摆进两条路线斗争中去，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透，批倒、批臭。同时，从每个人的思想上肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，克服资产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，确立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”这个“底”，就是在每个人的脑子里，坚持“斗私，批修”，解决世界观问题。“斗私，批修”是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉“私”字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。有的部队还把这种学习的新体会概括为：“在路线斗争上找问题，在毛主席著作上找答案，在灵魂深处找原因，在行动上看效果。”这样，就自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观的斗争，从围绕个人范围上升到了围绕两条路线斗争的政治领域；为人民服务的思想，从只顾埋头工作、帮人做好事，上升到自觉为保卫和支持无产阶级革命派夺权、用权、掌权的高度；破私立公，也从局限在一般具体问题上斗，上升到了在坚持革命大节上斗。
    他们把对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜，看作是最大的公；把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线，看作是最大的公；把时刻关心国家大事、世界大事、人民的大事，看作是最大的公；把紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，看作是最大的公。他们说：“破私立公抓住纲，国家大事心里装，立场坚定眼界宽，牢牢掌握大方向。”
    毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”一年来，广大指战员遵循毛主席的教导，走出营房，投身到无产阶级文化大革命的火热斗争中，学习毛泽东思想，经受了建军史上前所未有的革命群众运动的锻炼和考验。许多部队都在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，学习、掌握和运用毛泽东思想去分析形势，执行政策，决定行动，学出了新水平，用出了新水平，建立了新功劳，创造了新经验。他们热烈响应毛主席关于“拥军爱民”、开展革命大批判、实行革命大联合的伟大号召，在广阔的“三支”“两军”第一线上，同亿万革命群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起把斗争的矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，一起紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展革命的大批判，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，并在斗争中把“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》作为座右铭来学，反复学习，反复对照，紧紧掌握，寸步不离。有的部队在“三支”“两军”工作中有了缺点错误，就遵循毛主席关于“实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之”的指示，自觉地把问题提到两条路线斗争的纲上来，发扬勇于自我批评的精神，严格要求自己，向群众作检查，迅速改正。大家普遍感到，在阶级斗争中学习阶级斗争观点，在群众运动的现场学习群众观点，在为人民服务的过程中学习为人民服务的思想，在两类矛盾交错复杂的时候学习正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论，学得最实际，领会得最深刻，记得最牢靠，越学越想学，越学越放不下。有的说：在阶级斗争的课堂里学到的东西最过硬，毕业出来的“学生”最经得起考验。
    全军指战员在欢欣鼓舞回顾一年来大学特学革命宝书毛主席著作的大好形势和丰富经验时，满怀革命豪情地指出，毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一定要高举更高举；毛主席著作的学习，一定要抓紧更抓紧；部队的思想革命化，一定要加强再加强。
