With Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline, we will undertake the magnificent and great cause of educational revolution.

Nationwide revolutionary teachers and students resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to immediately resume classes and make revolution. We will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, engage in fierce self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, concentrate our efforts on carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our schools, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, and establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. We will turn our schools into vibrant Mao Zedong Thought schools.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 25th, today's editorial in the People's Daily, "All levels of schools should resume classes and make revolution," has been warmly welcomed by revolutionary teachers and students at all levels of schools nationwide. They said that this editorial conveys Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's greatest concern and care for us, and is the greatest encouragement and spur for us. They have decided to immediately resume classes and make revolution, concentrate their efforts on carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools, and achieve this magnificent and great cause of educational revolution.

Revolutionary teachers and students across the country have expressed their determination to respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, take "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism" as the guideline, and use Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline for the educational revolution. They will carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit, dare to break away from the bourgeois old frameworks that go against Mao Zedong Thought, dare to propose new socialist educational systems, new teaching content, and new teaching methods that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and through repeated revolutionary practices, establish a vibrant proletarian educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Taiyuan, Harbin, Guiyang, Xining, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, and other places have either resumed classes or are actively preparing to do so. Some primary schools have already fully reopened. To ensure the success of resuming classes and making revolution, some primary schools have sent letters to students' parents, seeking their opinions on educational reforms. Some universities have formed three-in-one teams consisting of students, teachers, and workers from affiliated factories, discussing and researching issues related to educational reforms. Many places have also held oath-taking meetings or on-site meetings for resuming classes and making revolution.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres at many primary and secondary schools across the country believe that resuming classes and making revolution, as well as carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools, is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, and a struggle between two worldviews. Every revolutionary teacher and student must take "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism" as the guideline, fiercely criticize the "self" in their minds, and with a high sense of proletarian revolutionary responsibility, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, and establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. They will turn their schools into vibrant Mao Zedong Thought schools. Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, which have officially reopened, held class discussions and school-wide discussions yesterday evening and this afternoon, respectively. Revolutionary teachers and students expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties, complete the educational reform, and ultimately end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. After studying the editorial in the People's Daily, revolutionary teachers and students at primary and secondary schools in Shanghai have gained a deeper understanding of the great strategic significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Shanghai's 11 districts and counties, which have achieved revolutionary unity, and some municipal-level middle school Red Guard organizations issued an emergency notice today regarding resuming classes and making revolution, emphasizing that resuming classes and making revolution must take "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism" as the guideline. Revolutionary students at Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which was the first to resume classes and make revolution, said that the first lesson of resuming classes and making revolution is self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, fiercely criticize non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, thoroughly criticize and smash all educational systems, teaching guidelines, and teaching methods of the exploiting classes and revisionism, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy every position on the educational front. Revolutionary teachers at Yuxiu Primary School in Guiyang, which has been resuming classes and making revolution since March this year, have deeply felt that the process of resuming classes and making revolution is the process of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They said that by grasping the guideline of "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism," the educational revolution will have a foothold. They expressed their determination to use Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution as a weapon, go to the students, and join forces with them to charge ahead and be pioneers in the educational revolution.

Many cities' colleges and universities, which have resumed classes and made revolution earlier, have taken Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline. Based on self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, they have been conducting teaching while carrying out reforms, achieving initial results. Since resuming classes and making revolution, Shandong Medical College and Shandong Chemical Engineering College have taken Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline, researching and exploring teaching reform plans. Revolutionary teachers and students at Shandong Medical College said that through this period of practice, they have gained a deeper understanding of how education can better serve proletarian politics, how medical education can better serve the countryside and the peasants, and the relationship between popularization and improvement in medical education. Since resuming classes and making revolution at the end of August, the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students at Zhejiang Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art College (formerly Zhejiang Art College) have fiercely criticized the revisionist educational line, further establishing the idea of creating for workers, peasants, and soldiers. With extremely high revolutionary enthusiasm, they held an art exhibition titled "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" and are currently creating works to praise the People's Liberation Army's great achievements in the Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary Red Guards at many schools have expressed that during the process of resuming classes and making revolution, they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, learn from the experience of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School, and achieve revolutionary unity under revolutionary principles, according to the system of teaching classes, grades, and departments. They will help revolutionary cadres and teachers to come forward and establish revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams.

At the oath-taking meeting for resuming classes and making revolution held by the Tianjin Middle School Revolutionary Committee, more than ten thousand middle school Red Guards expressed their determination to fiercely criticize the "self," establish the "public," overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, achieve revolutionary unity based on teaching classes, and actively and enthusiastically help revolutionary cadres and teachers to come forward. The Revolutionary Teachers' Headquarters of the Henan Erqi Commune Primary Schools, which was jointly established by more than five hundred primary schools in the Zhengzhou area, held a meeting on the 25th with representatives from affiliated schools to discuss issues related to resuming classes and making revolution. Everyone unanimously emphasized the need to quickly achieve revolutionary unity according to teaching classes under revolutionary principles. Students at Ningxia University, after listening to the broadcast of the People's Daily editorial yesterday, discussed how to achieve revolutionary unity and resume classes and make revolution together today.

Revolutionary teachers and cadres across the country who are responsible for training proletarian revolutionary successors have also expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, summon courage, and establish great aspirations to contribute to resuming classes and making revolution and achieving educational revolution. Revolutionary teachers in many places such as Xining, Taiyuan, and Wuhan have gone deep into the students, humbly learned from the revolutionary youngsters, studied Chairman Mao's works together with the revolutionary youngsters, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism together, and discussed issues related to educational revolution.

People's Liberation Army soldiers currently carrying out military and political training tasks across the country have warmly welcomed the editorial in the People's Daily, which has further clarified the direction for helping schools' revolutionary teachers and students to resume classes and make revolution. They expressed their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, study the spirit of the editorial together with revolutionary teachers and students, widely propagate the great significance of resuming classes and making revolution, help revolutionary teachers and students to diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest directives, and do a better job of resuming classes and making revolution.

    以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高纲领，实现教育革命的豪迈伟大事业
    全国广大革命师生坚决响应毛主席号召立即复课闹革命
    一定更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，狠狠地斗私批修，集中力量搞好本学校的斗批改，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    据新华社二十五日讯　《人民日报》今天的社论《大、中、小学校都要复课闹革命》，受到了全国各地大中小学广大革命师生极其热烈的欢迎。他们说，这篇社论传达了毛主席和党中央对我们的最大关怀，最大爱护，是对我们的最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。他们决心立即复课闹革命，集中力量搞好学校的斗批改，实现教育革命这个豪迈伟大的事业。
    各地广大革命师生纷纷表示，一定要响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席的“五·七”指示作为教育革命的最高纲领，发扬大无畏的革命精神，做教育革命的闯将，敢于破除违反毛泽东思想的那种资产阶级的旧框框，敢于提出符合毛泽东思想的新的社会主义教育制度、新的教学内容、新的教学方法，通过反复的革命实践，建立起一个红彤彤的闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级教育制度。
    北京、上海、济南、太原、哈尔滨、贵阳、西宁、天津、武汉、西安、呼和浩特、郑州、南昌、长沙、杭州、福州、成都、昆明、桂林等地的大中小学校，有的已经复课，有的正在积极准备复课，有些地方的小学已经全部开学。为了搞好复课闹革命，有些小学向学生家长发出书信，征求家长对教学改革的意见。有些高等学校按班级自动组成由学生、教师和附属工厂的工人参加的三结合班子，讨论和研究教学改革的问题。许多地方还召开了复课闹革命的誓师大会或现场会。
    全国各地许多大中小学的红卫兵小将、革命教师和革命干部在学习《人民日报》社论的时候认为，复课闹革命和搞好学校的斗批改，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是两种世界观的斗争。每个革命师生，都必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，以高度的无产阶级革命责任感，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。已经正式开学的北京农业大学和北京邮电学院，昨天夜里和今天下午，分别召开了按班级的讨论会和全院性的讨论会。广大革命师生豪迈地表示，一定要排除万难，完成教学改革，最终结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。上海大中小学的广大革命师生在学习了《人民日报》的社论以后，对伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修最新指示的伟大战略意义有了更加深刻的认识。上海市已经实现革命大联合的十一个区县的中学红卫兵组织和部分市级中学红卫兵组织，今天联合发出了有关复课闹革命的紧急通告，特别强调复课闹革命必须以“斗私，批修”为纲。广州市首先实现复课闹革命的广州中医学院的革命小将说，复课闹革命的第一课就是斗私批修，我们一定要更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗自己头脑中的非无产阶级思想，大破特破一切剥削阶级和修正主义的教育制度、教学方针和教学方法，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让毛泽东思想占领教育战线的每一个阵地。从今年三月就复课闹革命的贵阳毓秀小学的革命教师深有体会地说，复课闹革命的过程，就是斗私批修的过程，抓住了“斗私，批修”这个纲，教育革命才有着落。他们表示，要以毛主席关于教育革命的思想为武器，到学生中去，和学生结合在一起，在教育革命中打冲锋，当闯将。
    许多城市一些复课闹革命较早的大专学校，以毛主席的“五·七”指示作为最高纲领，在斗私批修的基础上，一边进行教学，一边进行改革，取得了初步成绩。山东医学院和山东化工学院从复课闹革命以来，就以毛主席的“五·七”指示作为最高方针，研究和探索教学改革的方案。山东医学院的革命师生说，经过这一段时间的实践，使我们对教育怎样才能更好地为无产阶级政治服务，医学教育怎样才能面向农村更好地为农民服务，以及医学教育中普及和提高的关系等，有了进一步的认识。浙江省工农兵美术大学（原浙江美术学院）的红卫兵小将和革命师生从八月底复课闹革命以来，狠批修正主义教育路线，进一步树立了为工农兵而创作的思想。他们以极高的革命热情，举办了“毛主席革命路线胜利万岁”的美术展览，最近又着手创作歌颂人民解放军在文化大革命中的丰功伟绩的作品。
    各地许多学校的革命师生和革命的红卫兵表示，在复课闹革命的过程中，一定要遵照毛主席的“三·七”指示，学习天津延安中学的经验，在革命的原则下，按照教学班、级、系的系统，实现革命的大联合，帮助革命的干部和教师站出来，建立革命三结合的领导班子。
    在天津市中学红代会举行的复课闹革命誓师大会上，参加大会的一万多名中学红卫兵小将表示，一定要狠斗私字，大立公字，克服小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级的党性，实现以教学班为基础的革命大联合，积极热情地帮助革命干部和革命教师站出来。郑州地区五百多所小学联合成立的河南二七公社小学教师总部，二十五日召集所属学校的部分革命师生代表座谈有关复课闹革命的问题，大家一致强调，一定要在革命的原则下，迅速按照教学班级实现革命的大联合。宁夏大学的学生昨天收听了《人民日报》社论的广播以后，今天上午各革命群众组织的学生就在一起研究如何实现革命大联合和复课闹革命的问题。
    对培养无产阶级革命接班人负有重大责任的各地革命教师和革命干部也纷纷表示，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的战斗号召，鼓起勇气，树立雄心壮志，为复课闹革命和实现教育革命做出贡献。西宁、太原和武汉等许多地方的革命教师，纷纷深入到学生中去，虚心向革命小将学习，同革命小将一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起讨论教育革命的问题。
    各地正在执行军政训练任务的人民解放军指战员，热烈欢呼《人民日报》社论给他们帮助各校革命师生复课闹革命进一步指明了方向。他们表示，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，和广大革命师生一起，认真学习社论精神，广泛宣传复课闹革命的伟大意义，帮助革命师生努力活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，把复课闹革命的工作做得好上加好。
