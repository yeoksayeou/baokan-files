The head of the "Malaysia" puppet regime, Rahman, recently announced that "Malaysia" has decided to exchange ambassadors with the Soviet revisionist clique.

The formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet revisionist clique and "Malaysia" is a predictable development. For a long time, the Soviet revisionist clique has been secretly colluding with the Rahman clique, showing them much favor. They have long been in cahoots, very intimate with each other. Now, both sides apparently feel that there is no need to hide their relationship any longer, so they have openly moved from secret collusion to public alliance.

It is well known that so-called "Malaysia" is not a sovereign state at all. It is a product of neo-colonialism created by American and British imperialism, a tool used by American and British imperialism to sabotage the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia. The Soviet revisionist clique has elevated this counter-revolutionary tool of imperialism to the heavens, shaking hands and embracing the Rahman puppet clique, which is nurtured by imperialism, calling each other brothers. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like have not only torn off their own mask of "supporting national liberation movements" but have also proven themselves to be enemies of the peoples of Asia.

The Soviet revisionist clique's open collusion with "Malaysia" is not an isolated incident. In recent years, the Soviet revisionist clique, in order to strengthen its counter-revolutionary alliance with American imperialism, has been working with the American empire to form an anti-China encirclement. At the same time, to promote its own neo-colonialism, it has been actively seeking out American imperialism's lackeys and servants in Asia. They have long been on intimate terms with Japan's Sato, Indonesia's Suharto, Thailand's Thanom, and the like. How could they overlook the Rahman clique, the imperialist "darling"? And for reactionaries like the Rahman clique to collude with the Soviet revisionist clique is by no means accidental. Twenty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "Dependence on American imperialism is a common feature of all reactionary forces in the world since the end of World War II." American imperialism is the bastion of world reaction. Now the Soviet revisionist clique has become another major base of world counter-revolution. Various reactionaries, while relying on American imperialism, naturally also regard the Soviet revisionist clique as another stronghold. Thus, for these reactionaries, "serving two masters" has become a common phenomenon.

However, today is an era of "earthquakes and thunderstorms in all five continents." Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries cannot rely on each other, and none can save the other's life. The Soviet revisionist clique and the "Malaysia" puppet clique embracing each other can only further expose their counter-revolutionary faces and hasten their own doom.

### “一仆二主”又一例

    “一仆二主”又一例
    “马来西亚”傀儡集团的头子拉赫曼最近宣布，“马来西亚”决定同苏修集团交换大使级外交代表。
    苏修集团同“马来西亚”正式建交，这是意料中的事情。长期以来，苏修集团一直同拉赫曼集团勾勾搭搭，献了许多殷勤。彼此之间早已心心相印，亲热得很。现在，双方显然认为已经不必再避人耳目，干脆从暗中勾搭转变为公开结合了。
    人所共知，所谓“马来西亚”根本不是一个主权国家。它是美英帝国主义一手炮制出来的新殖民主义产物，是美英帝国主义用来破坏东南亚民族解放运动的工具。苏修集团竟然把帝国主义的这一个反革命的工具捧上了天，同帝国主义豢养的走卒拉赫曼傀儡集团握手言欢，称兄道弟。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流这就不仅撕下了他们自己所谓“支持民族解放运动”的画皮，而且证明他们是亚洲各国人民的敌人。
    苏修集团同“马来西亚”公开勾结，并不是一件孤立的事情。近些年来，苏修集团为了加强同美帝国主义的反革命同盟，配合美帝拼凑反华包围圈，同时也是为了推行自己的新殖民主义，竭力搜罗美帝国主义在亚洲的走卒奴仆。他们同日本的佐藤、印尼的苏哈托、泰国的他侬之流早就打得火热，对于拉赫曼集团这个帝国主义“宠儿”，怎能放过呢？而象拉赫曼集团这样一些反动派勾结苏修集团，也绝非偶然。二十年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经指出，“对于美国帝国主义的依赖，是第二次世界大战结束以后全世界各国反动势力的共同特点。”美帝国主义是世界反动势力的堡垒。现在苏修集团已成为世界反革命的又一大本营，形形色色的反动派在投靠美帝国主义的同时，自然也要把苏修集团看作是它们的另一座靠山。于是，对这些反动派来说，“一仆二主”就成为一种流行的现象了。
    但是，今天是处于“五洲震荡风雷激”的时代，帝国主义、修正主义、反动派，谁也靠不了谁，谁也救不了谁的命。苏修集团同“马来西亚”傀儡集团之流拥抱在一起，只能更加暴露自己的反革命面目，加速他们的末日的到来。
