The People's Great Hall's reception hall resounded with the voices of Japanese revolutionary artists from the Kokoza Theater Troupe, singing from the bottom of their hearts. Their voices were so powerful and stirring. Every word and every sentence expressed the deep affection of Japanese revolutionary artists for our great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

The good news came. A great piece of good news came. This morning, when the Japanese Kokoza Theater Troupe's revolutionary artists heard that Chairman Mao was going to receive them, everyone was overjoyed, some even jumped for joy, shouting repeatedly, "Chairman Mao is going to receive us!" "Chairman Mao is going to receive us!" Before leaving the hotel, each of them, with boundless enthusiasm, selected the largest and brightest Mao badge to wear on their chests. Then, they held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," quickly gathered at the door, and sang "Beijing Has a Golden Sun" over and over again. This group of Japanese revolutionary artists, who had broken through the heavy oppression of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Japanese Communist Party revisionists, came to China with boundless love, respect, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. They thought of Chairman Mao day and night, longing to see him with their own eyes and express their wishes for his longevity. Because they missed Chairman Mao, they sometimes did not even want to sleep, sitting on the bed, waiting and waiting, saying, "We don't want to sleep. If Chairman Mao is going to receive us soon, what if we fall asleep?" Now, Chairman Mao is going to receive them, and their greatest wish in life is about to come true. How could these revolutionary artists not be deeply moved and sing joyfully?

With hearts full of joy, the Japanese revolutionary artists arrived at the reception hall of the People's Great Hall. Before the reception, they held up the revolutionary classics, reading Chairman Mao's teachings aloud together, over and over again. They opened the preface written by Comrade Lin Biao for the reprint of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud together: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage."

The most blissful moment arrived! At 12:15 PM on October 23, 1967, our great leader Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao and comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Boda, and Yao Wenyuan, came to the reception hall. The hall buzzed with excitement. The Japanese revolutionary artists waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting joyfully, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao longevity! Longevity!" The Japanese revolutionary artists, facing the red sun Chairman Mao, with tears in their eyes, sang "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" passionately. Our beloved Chairman Mao understands the wishes of the Japanese revolutionary people. He and Comrade Lin Biao and others took photos with the Japanese revolutionary artists and applauded to show their respect.

The great leader Chairman Mao left the reception hall amidst the cheers, but the Japanese revolutionary artists, still filled with excitement, did not want to leave. They jumped and embraced each other, saying, "The great leader Chairman Mao is so healthy. This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and all revolutionary people around the world!" Many people, wiping their tears, opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and carefully wrote down this unforgettable moment of happiness on the front page.

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You received us, this is the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people!"

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! No matter what difficulties we encounter in the future, we will always follow you, always follow the revolutionary direction you point out, and march from victory to victory!"

After leaving the reception hall, the revolutionary artists of the Kokoza Theater Troupe were overwhelmed with emotion, unable to contain their excitement. Everyone tightly held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," determined to remember this day forever and dedicate their lives to the liberation cause of the Japanese people.

Fujikawa Natsu, the 56-year-old director who shook hands with Chairman Mao, became as young as a youth today. She held hands with her comrades, sharing this greatest happiness with everyone. She said excitedly, "It is the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao that have led Kokoza onto the bright path. It is Mao Zedong Thought that guided us to rebel against revisionism and be reborn."

Fujikawa Natsu spoke for the hearts of the revolutionary artists of the Kokoza Theater Troupe. Everyone recalled the past: the Kokoza Theater Troupe, which had been established for fifteen years, had long been controlled by Japanese Communist Party revisionists, deviating from the revolutionary path of serving the workers and peasants, performing so-called "common interest" plays of grandeur, foreign influence, and antiquity. The working people did not welcome such a troupe. Kokoza was on the brink of collapse.

It was the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao in China that shook Kokoza and gave the revolutionary artists the courage to rebel. They drew a clear line with the Japanese Communist Party revisionist group. The young people in the troupe used big-character posters to fiercely attack the revisionist elements within the troupe, driving them out of the troupe.

It was the early morning of New Year's Day in 1967. The revolutionary fighters within the troupe hung a portrait of Chairman Mao high in the rehearsal hall. In front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, all the troupe members took an oath together: to firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely be good students of Chairman Mao. To take Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as the guiding principle for the future.

From then on, the revolutionary artists of Kokoza followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Our literary and artistic workers... must shift their position, must, in the process of going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, in the process of learning Marxism and learning about society, gradually shift over to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have true literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, true proletarian literature and art." They went deep into the countryside and mines, participated in production labor, and created scripts reflecting the struggles of workers and peasants with the help of workers and peasants. Poor peasants said: Welcome back to the countryside! Workers said: You have become our troupe. The broad masses of workers and peasants encouraged them: This is the right path.

The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shone on them, and the dew of Mao Zedong Thought nourished them. Kokoza rolled forward on the revolutionary path.

Director Fujikawa Natsu said excitedly that today was the most meaningful and precious day in her fifty-six years. The comrades of Kokoza decided to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to strive for the liberation cause of the Japanese people for life.

Actress Sawahara Motoko was one of the young pioneers who first posted big-character posters in the troupe, fiercely attacking Japanese Communist Party revisionists. After meeting Chairman Mao and returning to the hotel, she opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gazing at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the front page for a long time, and murmured to herself: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who gave me boundless strength to fight against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries; it is you who gave me endless wisdom to rebel against the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. Beloved Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you in revolution. No matter what difficulties and obstacles we encounter, we will remember your teachings: "Resolutely take a stand, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Shinoda Katsuyuki, the young actor, had boundless admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless love for Chairman Mao's works. He hung his beloved portrait of Chairman Mao by his bed so that he could see Chairman Mao every day. He copied some of Chairman Mao's quotations that targeted his own thoughts onto paper and hung them by his bed so that he could hear Chairman Mao's teachings at any time. He took Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" as his motto and made many notes seriously. He said with deep emotion that from our actual struggles, we understood that Chairman Mao is the savior of the Japanese people. The Japanese people want revolution and must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we listen to Chairman Mao's words and read Chairman Mao's books, we will have clear minds and boundless strength, and we will have the confidence to win. For the victory of the Japanese revolution, we are determined to be good students of Chairman Mao and excellent propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

Playwright Fukushima Hisayoshi returned to the hotel, happily recalling the scene of seeing Chairman Mao just now. After coming to China, in the process of revising the scripts for "Wildfire" and "Advancing Against the Storm," Fukushima Hisayoshi opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" countless times, drawing guidance and strength from it, and finally successfully revised the scripts with his comrades, making these two scripts shine with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. At this moment, he picked up his beloved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wrote down the most unforgettable moment under Chairman Mao's portrait: October 23, 1967, 12:15 PM. Fukushima Hisayoshi, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said excitedly, "No matter when, as long as I pick up 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' as long as I see this page, I will have boundless strength and courage."

Young musician Tsuda Katsuharu, after coming to China, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, decided to compose music for some of Chairman Mao's quotations, preparing to take them back to Japan to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and inspire and guide the Japanese people to fight. In the process of composing, he wrote and studied Chairman Mao's related works. The songs he composed, "Determine to Struggle," "Our Comrades in Difficult Times Should See Achievements," and "Advancing Along the Bloodstained Path of the Martyrs," have powerful and stirring melodies, full of fighting spirit. He said, "I will be a good soldier of Chairman Mao for life and propagate Mao Zedong Thought all my life."

At the most blissful moment, when Chairman Mao applauded to show his respect to the Japanese revolutionary artists, the young actor Yamamoto Taku, with tears of happiness, held up the red revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high and led everyone to shout repeatedly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" He said, "We are representing one hundred million Japanese people to see Chairman Mao. The Japanese revolutionary people will definitely be as happy as we are when they hear the news that Chairman Mao received us, shouting joyfully, 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!'"

So many words cannot express the boundless love of the Japanese revolutionary artists for Chairman Mao; so many songs cannot sing the boundless respect of the Japanese revolutionary artists for Chairman Mao. All words and songs condense into one sentence: Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts! Under the radiance of your brilliant thoughts, a new Japan belonging to the Japanese revolutionary people will definitely appear in the East.

    毛主席，我们心中的红太阳
    “大海航行靠舵手”
    “爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”……
    人民大会堂接见大厅，响彻着日本齿轮座剧团革命文艺战士们发自心底的歌声。这歌声是那样宏亮，是那样激动人心。这歌声，字字句句表达了日本革命文艺战士，对我们伟大的领袖、世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席无限热爱的深情。
    喜讯传来了，一个特大的喜讯传来了。今天上午，当日本齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士们听到毛主席要接见他们的时候，大家高兴得真是心花怒放，有的人高兴得跳了起来，一个劲地欢呼：“毛主席要接见我们了！”“毛主席要接见我们了！”在从旅馆出发之前，他们每一个人，都满怀激情地选一枚最大最亮的毛主席像章，佩戴在胸前。随后，他们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，迅速地聚集到大门口，一遍又一遍地唱起《北京有个金太阳》。从美日反动派和日共修正主义分子重重压迫下冲杀出来的这批日本革命文艺战士，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜的感情，越过重洋，来到中国。他们日日夜夜想念毛主席，时时刻刻盼望亲眼见到毛主席，当面表达他们敬祝毛主席万寿无疆的感情。因为想念毛主席，他们有时连觉也不愿睡，坐在床上，等呀，等呀，他们说：“我们不想睡，毛主席如果马上要接见我们，我们睡下了，那怎么好呢！”现在，毛主席就要接见他们了，一生中最大最大的愿望就要实现了，这怎么能不叫这些革命的文艺战士无限激动、尽情欢唱呢？
    日本革命文艺战士们怀着万分喜悦的心情，来到了人民大会堂接见厅。接见之前，他们手持革命宝书，一遍又一遍地齐声朗读毛主席的教导。他们打开林彪同志为《毛主席语录》再版写的前言，齐声朗读：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”
    最最幸福的时刻来到了！一九六七年十月二十三日中午十二时十五分，我们伟大的领袖毛主席同他的亲密战友林彪副主席，以及周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、江青、张春桥、戚本禹、姚文元等同志，来到了接见厅。大厅里沸腾起来了。日本革命文艺战士们挥动着《毛主席语录》，尽情地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”日本革命文艺战士们迎着红太阳毛主席，噙着泪花，激动地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。敬爱的毛主席最了解日本革命人民的心愿，他老人家和林彪等同志，同日本革命文艺战士们合影留念，并且鼓掌向他们致意。
    伟大的领袖毛主席在一片欢呼声中离开了接见厅，可是日本革命文艺战士仍然怀着激动的心情，久久不愿离去。他们在一起欢腾跳跃，互相握手拥抱。他们说：“伟大领袖毛主席那样健康，这是中国人民、日本人民和全世界革命人民的最大幸福！”许多人，拭着热泪，打开《毛主席语录》，在扉页上工工整整地记下了这难忘的幸福会见的时刻。
      “毛主席呀，毛主席！您接见了我们，这是对日本人民革命斗争最大的支持和鼓舞！”
      “毛主席呀，毛主席！今后不管遇到什么困难，我们永远跟着您，永远按照您指引的革命方向，从胜利走向胜利！”
    从接见厅走了出来，齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士们心潮澎湃，抑制不住内心的激动。大家紧紧握住红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，要永远铭记这一天，决心把一生献给日本人民的解放事业。
    同毛主席握了手的五十六岁的团长藤川夏子，今天变得象个青年。她和同志们紧紧握手，让大家共享这最大的幸福。她激动地说：“是伟大领袖毛主席的教导，齿轮座才走上光明大道，是毛泽东思想指引我们造了修正主义的反，重获新生。”
    藤川夏子说出了齿轮座剧团革命文艺战士们心里的话。大家忆起过去的情况：成立了十五年的齿轮座剧团，过去由于日共修正主义者的控制，曾长时期地脱离了革命的为工农服务的方向，演所谓有“共同兴趣”的大、洋、古戏。劳动人民不欢迎这样的剧团。齿轮座濒于绝路。
    是伟大的毛泽东思想，是毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国的无产阶级文化大革命，震动了齿轮座，给了革命文艺战士以造反的勇气。他们和日共修正主义集团坚决划清界限。剧团的青年人用大字报，向剧团内的修正主义分子猛烈开火，把他们赶出了剧团。
    那是一九六七年元旦的清晨。剧团内革命的战士们在排练场内，高高挂起毛主席像，在伟大领袖毛主席像前，全体团员一起宣誓：要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决做毛主席的好学生。要以毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》为今后指导方针。
    从此，齿轮座的革命文艺战士们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们的文艺工作者……一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺”，深入到农村、矿山，参加生产劳动，在工人、农民帮助下，创作出反映工人农民斗争的剧本。贫苦农民说：欢迎你们回到农村来！工人们说：你们成了我们的剧团了。广大工农观众鼓励他们：这条路走对了。
    毛泽东思想的阳光照耀着他们，毛泽东思想的雨露滋润着他们，齿轮座在革命的大道上滚滚向前。
    藤川夏子团长激动地说，今天是我五十六年中最有意义、最珍贵的一天。齿轮座的同志们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，为日本人民的解放事业奋斗终身。
    女演员佐原元子，是在剧团内首先贴出大字报，大造日共修正主义的反的一批青年闯将中间的一个。在会见了毛主席，回到旅馆以后，她打开《毛主席语录》，久久地端详着扉页上的毛主席像，暗暗自语：毛主席啊，毛主席！是您给了我无比的力量，去同美日反动派进行斗争；是您给了我无穷的智慧，去造日共修正主义分子的反。敬爱的毛主席，我们要永远紧跟您干革命。不论遇到什么艰难险阻，我们都要记住您的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    篠田胜之，这位年青的演员对伟大的领袖毛主席无限敬仰，对毛主席的著作无限热爱。他把心爱的毛主席像挂在自己的床头，为的是能天天见到毛主席，他把一些针对自己活思想的毛主席语录，抄在纸上贴在自己的床头，为的是能随时听见毛主席的教导。他把毛主席的“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，并且认真地做了许多笔记。他深情地说，我们从自己的实际斗争中懂得了，毛主席就是我们日本人民的救星，日本人民要革命，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。只要我们听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，我们就会心明眼亮，浑身有力量，就有了胜利的信心。为了日本革命的胜利，我们决心做毛主席的好学生，做出色的毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    编剧福岛久嘉回到旅馆，幸福地回忆着刚才见到毛主席的情景。福岛久嘉在来到中国后，在改编《野火》和《迎着暴风雨前进》剧本的过程中，不知多少次地翻开《毛主席语录》，从中取得教导和力量，终于和同志们一起改编成功，使这两个剧本闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。此刻，他又拿起心爱的《毛主席语录》，在扉页的毛主席像下记下了最难忘的时刻：一九六七年十月二十三日十二时十五分。福岛久嘉手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，激动地说，不管在什么时候，只要拿起《毛主席语录》，只要看到这一页，就会有无穷的力量和勇气。
    年青的音乐工作者津田胜治，来到中国以后，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，决心要为毛主席的一些语录谱曲，准备带回日本，在日本宣传毛泽东思想，鼓舞和指导日本人民进行斗争。他在作曲的过程中，边写边学习毛主席的有关著作。他所谱成的毛主席语录歌：《下定决心》、《我们的同志在困难的时候要看到成绩》、《踏着先烈的血迹前进》，旋律雄壮有力，充满战斗气息。他说，我要终身做毛主席的好战士，一辈子宣传毛泽东思想。
    在最最幸福的时刻，在毛主席向日本革命文艺战士鼓掌致意的时候，剧团里的青年演员山本卓，含着幸福的泪水，高高举起红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，率领大家一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”他说，我们是代表一亿日本人民来见毛主席的。日本革命人民听到毛主席接见我们的消息，他们一定会象我们一样，欢欣无比，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    多少话，说不尽日本革命文艺战士对毛主席的无限热爱；多少歌，唱不完日本革命文艺战士对毛主席的无限敬仰。千言万语凝成一句话：毛主席啊，您是我们心中的红太阳！在您的光辉思想照耀下，一个属于日本革命人民的新日本，必将出现在世界的东方。
