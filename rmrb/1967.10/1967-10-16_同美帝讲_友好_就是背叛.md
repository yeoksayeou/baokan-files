The Chinese Khrushchev once absurdly claimed: “Even with the United States, we hope to improve relations with it. If the United States withdraws its troops from Taiwan, there would be no dispute, and friendly relations can be developed.” This is the Chinese Khrushchev’s confession of his flattery and capitulation to American imperialism.

Can China and the American Empire truly “develop friendly relations”?

Since the Opium War of 1840, American imperialism has never ceased its military, political, economic, and cultural aggression against China. Especially, it provided $591.4 million in aid to Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war, killing millions of Chinese people, and accumulating a mountain of blood debts. Shortly after the birth of socialist China, the wicked American imperialism rallied the “United Nations forces” to launch a savage invasion of Korea aimed at the new China. To this day, it still harbors evil intentions, occupying our territory of Taiwan, frequently violating our territorial waters and airspace, brazenly engaging in military provocations, establishing a series of military bases around our country, organizing an anti-China encirclement, and seriously threatening our security. Moreover, it attempts to impose a “peaceful evolution” policy on our country, aiming to restore capitalism in China... All of this is the American imperialism’s expression of “friendship” towards the Chinese people over the past hundred years!

Chairman Mao said, “American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the world.” Its aggressive “nature cannot be changed.” Lenin once clearly pointed out that the existence of socialist countries fundamentally contradicts the wishes of imperialism. Although socialist countries insist on a peaceful foreign policy, imperialism is always unwilling to coexist peacefully with socialist countries and always seeks every possible opportunity to oppose and even eliminate socialist countries. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, avoids discussing the struggle against American imperialism and instead advocates developing “friendly relations” with the ruthless American imperialism. His purpose is to make the Chinese people surrender to American imperialism, bury the great achievements of the Chinese people’s revolutionary struggle, and follow in the footsteps of the Soviet revisionists, bringing China into the “sacred alliance” of “Sino-American cooperation” to jointly suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, and completely betray the fundamental interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The great socialist China is the red base of the world revolution. American imperialism is the main stronghold of all reactionary forces in the world. How can socialist China and the head of imperialism, the United States, talk about “friendship”?

The Chinese Khrushchev attributes the reason for the Chinese people’s opposition to American imperialism solely to the fact that American imperialism has sent troops to occupy Taiwan, claiming that if American imperialism withdraws its troops, then socialist China can “develop friendly relations” with American imperialism. In essence, this means that we will no longer oppose American imperialism’s policy of aggression and war, and we will no longer support the just struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations for freedom and independence. This is sheer nationalism and a complete betrayal of proletarian internationalism!

American imperialism must get out of our territory of Taiwan, and we must liberate Taiwan. We not only oppose American imperialism’s aggression against our country but also firmly oppose American imperialism’s aggression and enslavement of the peoples of other countries. The Chinese people have always fully supported the struggles of the peoples of all countries against American imperialism. This is our proletarian internationalist duty. As long as American imperialism exists for one more day, the Chinese people’s struggle against American imperialism will not stop for one more day. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates that as long as American imperialism withdraws from Taiwan, China and American imperialism can “be friendly.” This is a highly reactionary fallacy. The Chinese people are friendly with the American people, but American imperialism will forever be the mortal enemy of the Chinese people.

The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to seek personal gain, actually describes American imperialism’s aggression against our country and our people’s struggle against aggression as a “dispute” between China and the United States. This is extremely reactionary. “Dispute” means that right and wrong are not yet determined. This is something that even a Chinese person with a little patriotism cannot say.

In summary, the revisionist goods that the Chinese Khrushchev peddles and promotes in his foreign activities are to make the Chinese people abandon the principles of proletarian internationalism, give up the struggle against American imperialism, and instead shake hands and make friends with the aggressive American imperialism, talking about “friendship,” thereby achieving his treacherous goal of completely betraying the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

The Chinese people will always unswervingly implement Chairman Mao’s general line of foreign policy, unite with all oppressed peoples and nations of the world, form the broadest united front against American imperialism, and foil all of American imperialism’s plans for aggression and war. The American imperialist robbers must get out of Taiwan, and get out of all countries and places where they have invaded, controlled, interfered with, and bullied! Completely bury American imperialism!

　　同美帝讲“友好”就是背叛
　　王洪彦
    中国赫鲁晓夫曾经胡说什么：“就是美国，我们也希望同它搞好关系，……如果美国从台湾把军队撤出去，争论就没有了，可以发展友好关系”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫向美帝国主义献媚取宠、屈膝投降的自供。
    果真中国和美帝之间能够“发展友好关系”吗？
    从一八四○年鸦片战争以来，美帝国主义从未间断对中国进行军事、政治、经济和文化侵略。特别是它以五十九亿一千四百余万美元“援助”蒋介石打内战，杀死几百万中国人，欠下了累累血债。在社会主义中国刚刚诞生不久，万恶的美帝国主义又纠集“联合国军”发动了矛头指向新中国的灭绝人性的侵朝战争。至今它仍贼心不死，霸占着我国领土台湾，不断地侵犯我国的领海和领空，肆无忌惮地进行军事挑衅，在我国周围建立了一系列军事基地，组织反华包围圈，严重威胁着我国的安全。非但如此，它还力图对我国推行“和平演变”政策，在中国实行资本主义复辟……这一切，就是美帝国主义一百多年来对中国人民“友好”的表示！
    毛主席说，“美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。”它的侵略“本性是不能改变的”。列宁曾经明确地指出，社会主义国家的存在，是根本违反帝国主义意愿的。尽管社会主义国家坚持实行和平的外交政策，但是，帝国主义总是不愿意同社会主义国家和平共处，总是要利用一切可能，抓住一切机会，来反对以至消灭社会主义国家。而中国赫鲁晓夫闭口不谈对美帝国主义的斗争，却大肆鼓吹要与穷凶极恶的美帝国主义“发展友好关系”。其目的，就是要中国人民投降美帝国主义，葬送中国人民革命斗争的伟大成果，而步苏修后尘，把中国纳入“苏美合作”的“神圣同盟”，去共同镇压各国人民的革命斗争，彻底叛卖世界革命人民的根本利益。
    伟大的社会主义中国是世界革命的红色根据地。美帝国主义是世界一切反动势力的主要堡垒。社会主义中国和帝国主义的头子美国又怎么能谈什么“友好”呢！
    中国赫鲁晓夫把中国人民反对美帝国主义斗争的原因，仅仅归结为美帝国主义派军队侵占台湾，说什么如果美帝国主义撤军，那么社会主义的中国就可以同美帝国主义“发展友好关系”了。实质上也就是说再也不反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策了，再也不支持一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取自由独立的正义斗争了。这是彻头彻尾的民族利己主义，这是对无产阶级国际主义的彻底背叛！
    美帝国主义必须从中国领土台湾滚出去，我们一定要解放台湾。我们不仅反对美帝对我国的侵略，而且坚决反对美帝对其他国家人民的侵略和奴役。中国人民从来是全力支持各国人民反对美帝的斗争的，这是我们的无产阶级国际主义义务。只要美帝一天不消灭，中国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争就一天不会停止。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹，只要美帝国主义滚出台湾，中国和美帝国主义就可以“友好”了。这是极其反动的谬论。中国人民同美国人民是友好的，但是，美帝国主义永远是中国人民的死敌。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了卖国求荣，竟然把美帝对我国的侵略和我国人民反侵略的斗争，说成是中美两国的“争论”。真是反动透顶。“争论”者，是非未定也。这是一个稍有爱国心的中国人都说不出来的话。
    总之，中国的赫鲁晓夫在对外活动中所贩卖推行的修正主义黑货，就是要中国人民背弃无产阶级国际主义原则，放弃同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，而与侵略成性的美帝国主义握手言欢，大谈“友好”，从而达到他彻底叛卖中国革命和世界革命的反革命罪恶目的。
    中国人民将始终不渝地坚决贯彻执行毛主席的对外政策总路线，与全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族联合起来，结成反对美帝国主义的最广泛的统一战线，挫败美帝国主义的一切侵略计划和战争计划。美帝国主义强盗必须从台湾滚出去，从一切受它侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和地方滚出去！彻底埋葬美帝国主义！
