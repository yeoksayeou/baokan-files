In the face of a savage attack by Indonesian mobs and reactionary military police, Chinese embassy staff in Indonesia bravely struggled and raised the Five-Star Red Flag again.

	New China News Agency, October 3rd: According to foreign news agencies, on the early morning of October 1st, the Chinese embassy in Indonesia, which had been severely injured and cut off from communication with the motherland, was attacked by a large number of Indonesian mobs and reactionary military police. In extremely difficult circumstances, the embassy staff fought back and raised the great national flag of the People's Republic of China in the embassy compound.

	According to reports, on the early morning of October 1st, when the Chinese people were celebrating their great national day, the Indonesian reactionary government, in a heartless and maddened act, once again instigated a large number of mobs and reactionary military police to savagely attack the Chinese embassy in Indonesia. They injured Chinese diplomatic personnel, damaged embassy equipment, and publicly tore down the Chinese national flag in the embassy compound, replacing it with the Indonesian flag. In this critical moment, the Chinese embassy staff fearlessly resisted, demonstrating their boundless love and loyalty to their beloved motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao. When they were persecuted by the Indonesian reactionary military police, they collectively recited Chairman Mao's quotations and remained unyielding. The severely injured Chinese embassy staff strongly protested against the Indonesian reactionary government's outrageous anti-China actions. They defied the reactionary government's brutality, tore down the Indonesian flag in the embassy compound, and raised the Five-Star Red Flag once again. The great national flag of the People's Republic of China proudly waved in the wind above the Chinese embassy in Indonesia.

    新华社三日讯　据外国通讯社报道，十月一日凌晨遭到印度尼西亚大批暴徒和反动军警疯狂袭击、身负重伤、和祖国的联系完全中断的中国驻印尼大使馆的外交人员，在极端困难的环境下坚持斗争，在使馆院内重新升起了伟大的中华人民共和国的国旗。
    据报道，十月一日凌晨，正值中国人民庆祝自己的伟大节日——国庆节的时候，印尼反动政府竟然丧心病狂，再一次指使大批暴徒和反动军警，疯狂袭击中国驻印尼大使馆，打伤中国外交人员，破坏中国使馆的各种设备，并公然在大使馆院内撕下中国国旗，扯起印尼国旗。中国使馆的外交人员在危难关头，不畏强暴，坚持斗争，表现了对自己亲爱的祖国和伟大的领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限忠诚。当他们受到印尼反动军警的迫害时，他们集体背诵毛主席语录，英勇不屈。身负重伤的中国使馆外交人员，对印尼反动派的猖狂反华，愤怒地向印尼反动政府提出了强烈的抗议。他们藐视印尼反动派的横暴，在使馆院内扯下了印尼国旗，重新升起了无比庄严的五星红旗。伟大的中华人民共和国国旗又在中国驻印尼使馆的上空傲然地迎风招展。
