The Soviet revisionist group has promised to give the Indian reactionaries 500 million rubles in economic "aid" to help them develop bureaucratic capitalist enterprises during their fourth "five-year plan."

This was announced by India's Minister of Industrial Development, Fakhruddin Ahmed, after his eight-day activities in the Soviet Union on October 12. Since September, while the Indian reactionaries have been launching frenzied anti-China campaigns and conducting two serious military provocations against China along the China-Burma border, India's Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Minister of Industrial Development, and others have successively gone to the Soviet Union to seek rewards. The Soviet revisionist group, in order to encourage the Indian reactionaries to be even more frenzied in their anti-China stance, has generously given them large rewards.

Over the past decade, the Soviet revisionist leadership has bought and supported the Indian reactionaries, exploiting the Indian people. To date, the total amount of Soviet revisionist "economic aid" to India has reached 1350 million US dollars, all of which has been concentrated in the heavy industry sector controlled by Indian bureaucratic capital.

　　苏修集团犒赏印度反动派反华
    据新华社十三日讯　莫斯科消息：在印度反动派掀起猖狂反华的浪潮中，苏修叛徒集团答应给印度反动派五亿卢布的经济“援助”，让印度在第四个“五年计划”期间发展官僚资本企业。
    这是印度工业发展部长法赫鲁丁·艾哈迈德在苏联进行了八天活动后十二日在莫斯科宣布的。九月份以来，印度反动派在中锡边境向中国两次进行严重的军事挑衅的同时，印度总理、国防部长、工业发展部长等接连到苏联去邀功请赏。苏修集团为了鼓励印度反动派更加猖狂反华，慷慨地给予它大量犒赏。
    十年来，苏修领导集团收买和扶植印度反动派，剥削印度人民。迄今，苏修对印度经济“援助”总数已达十三亿五千万美元，全部集中在印度官僚资本控制的重工业部门。
