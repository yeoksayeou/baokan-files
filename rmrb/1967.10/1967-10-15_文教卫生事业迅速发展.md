The liberated areas of Laos, from cities to rural villages, have established schools, hospitals, and medical stations. Cultural life is rich and varied, with film projection teams and cultural troupes performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers.

KANGAI, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the brave military and civilian people of the liberated areas of Laos have overcome the war destruction by U.S. imperialism and its Vientiane lackeys, rapidly developing the cultural, educational, and health services in the liberated areas. Currently, in the liberated areas that cover two-thirds of the country's land, from densely populated plains to sparsely populated mountain regions, schools, hospitals, and medical stations have been established, providing educational opportunities for the broad masses of workers and peasants, and further safeguarding the health of the people.

Currently, there are nearly 38,000 students in the liberated areas. In the first three months of this year, many schools were opened in various provincial liberated areas. Luang Prabang Province and Champasak Province opened five schools; Xieng Khouang Province opened two ethnic schools. To meet the needs of the rapidly developing educational sector, eight normal schools were newly built in provinces such as Xiangkhouang, Vientiane, and Savannakhet to train teachers for various places.

The cultural and educational departments also pay special attention to creating scripts for minority nationalities. To further promote the Laotian Song script, a Laotian Song teacher training class was recently opened in Manthathur County, Vientiane Province, and efforts are being made to create a script for the Laotian Hmong.

The liberated areas also pay due attention to the education of adults. Cultural improvement classes have been set up in various agencies, factories, and hospitals. In some counties, campaigns to eliminate illiteracy have been launched.

The cultural life of the people in the liberated areas is becoming increasingly rich and varied. Film projection teams and cultural troupes frequently tour various places, showing films and performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers. Various agencies and villages have organized many amateur cultural troupes, performing various programs they have written and directed themselves. The local troops in Khammouane Province created 24 plays and 72 songs in the past year, praising the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Lao patriotic military and civilians. These programs have been well received by the broad audience.

Currently, there are many hospitals or medical stations in the liberated areas. The health departments have also organized many mobile medical teams, going deep into rural areas and remote mountain regions to prevent and treat diseases for the people, and actively promoting health knowledge.

The ranks of medical workers in the liberated areas are also continuously expanding. In recent years, the Central Hospital run by the Central Health Department and the health training classes run by local health departments have trained a large number of medical personnel.

　　文教卫生事业迅速发展
    老挝解放区从城市到农村都建立了学校、医院和医疗站，文化生活丰富多采，电影放映队和文工队巡回为工农兵演出
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：英勇的老挝解放区军民，战胜了美帝国主义和它的万象走狗的战争破坏，迅速地发展了解放区文教卫生事业。目前，在占全国土地面积三分之二的解放区内，从城市到农村，从人口众多的平原到人烟稀少的山区，都建立了学校、医院和医疗站，使解放区广大工农子弟获得了就学的机会，人民的健康进一步得到保障。
    目前，解放区共有近三万八千名学生。今年头三个月，各省解放区开办了许多学校。琅勃拉邦省和东方省就开办了五所学校；丰沙里省开办了两所民族学校。为了适应教育事业迅速发展的需要，桑怒、万象、沙湾拿吉等省新建了八所师范学校，为各地培养教师。
    文教部门还特别注意为少数民族创造文字的工作。为了进一步推广寮松族文字，最近在万象省芒塞县开办了一个寮松语师资培训班，并正在积极为寮听族创造文字。
    解放区对成年人的教育也给予了应有的重视。在各个机关、工厂和医院里，都纷纷开办了文化进修班。在一些县还开展扫除文盲的活动。
    解放区人民的文化生活也日益丰富多采。电影放映队和文工队不断巡回各地，为工农兵放映和演出。各机关和农村组织了许多业余文艺队，自编自演各种节目。川圹省地方部队在过去一年中，就创作了二十四出歌颂老挝爱国军民抗美救国斗争的话剧和七十二首歌曲。这些节目博得了广大观众的好评。
    目前，解放区设有许多医院或医疗站。卫生部门还组织了许多巡回医疗队，深入农村和偏僻的山区，为人民防疫治病，大力进行卫生常识的宣传。
    解放区医务工作者的队伍也不断发展壮大。几年来，由中央卫生部门开办的中央医院和各地卫生部门开办的卫生训练班，培养出了大批医务人员。
