The strike involving 30,000 American steel transportation truck drivers, which has spread across eight states, has persisted for over two months. This strike not only severely impacted the American steel industry, forcing production cuts, but has also begun to affect the construction industry in some states. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, some construction projects have been reduced due to a lack of steel materials. In certain states, angry striking workers have set up roadblocks on highways and have used stones and gunshots to punish those daring to transport steel for the monopolistic groups on behalf of the bosses. In Pennsylvania, despite the reactionary authorities deploying large numbers of National Guard and state police to suppress the striking workers, they have been unable to control the situation.

The strike involving 50,000 American copper miners and refinery workers has lasted for over three months. Reports indicate that this strike has halted 97% of America's copper production, resulting in a reduction of over 340,000 tons of copper. Currently, many copper-using industries in the United States are nearly out of domestic inventory.

The strike involving 160,000 workers at Ford Motor Company has lasted for over a month, severely impacting the American economy. Statistics show that in the past week, American automobile production has decreased by 15% compared to the same period last year.

The strike involving over 1,600 employees of Ohio State University, one of America's largest schools, began on October 5, demanding wage increases and improved working conditions. Their just actions have received sympathy and support from a large number of students at the school. On that day, over 1,500 students gathered at the school gate, singing loudly to express their support. The reactionary authorities even dispatched a large number of police to suppress the students, injuring and arresting many. However, the striking employees and students are fearless and are resolutely fighting back. Currently, the striking employees are still in the midst of their struggle. Many students, despite the school authorities' threats of disciplinary action, actively participated in the strike's picket lines.

　　美国工人罢工简讯
    扩及八个州的三万名美国钢铁运输汽车司机的大罢工，已经坚持两个多月，这次大罢工不仅严重地打击了美国的钢铁工业，迫使钢铁减产，而且开始影响一些州的建筑业，俄亥俄和宾夕法尼亚的一些建筑工程因缺乏钢材而被迫削减许多项目。在一些州，愤怒的罢工工人在公路上设置了许多路障，并用石块和枪弹狠狠地教训那些胆敢继续为垄断集团运输钢铁的工贼。在宾夕法尼亚州，尽管反动当局出动大批国民警卫队和州的骑警镇压罢工工人，但仍然无法控制事态的发展。
    五万名美国铜矿和炼铜工人的大罢工已经坚持三个多月。据报道，这次大罢工使美国百分之九十七的铜的生产陷于停顿，使美国铜的生产减产了三十四万多吨。目前美国许多用铜工业的国内存货即将用完。
    美国福特汽车公司十六万名工人的大罢工，坚持了一个多月，严重地打击了美国的经济。据统计，最近一周内美国汽车的生产比去年同期减产了百分之十五。
    美国最大的学校之一、俄亥俄州州立大学的一千六百多名职工，十月五日起举行罢工，要求增加工资、改善工作条件。他们的正义行动受到这个学校广大学生的同情和支持，当天就有一千五百多学生聚集在校门口，高声歌唱，表示支持。反动当局竟然出动大批警察前来镇压，打伤和逮捕学生多人，但是罢工的职工和学生毫不畏惧，坚决进行回击。目前，罢工的职工还在坚持斗争中。许多学生不顾学校当局“校纪制裁”的威胁，积极参加了罢工的纠察队。（据新华社讯）
