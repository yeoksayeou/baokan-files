In the struggle against self and revisionism, the Jiangxi Shipbuilding and Repair Factory has liberated a large number of revolutionary cadres, winning over and uniting the majority of cadres. Currently, 85% of the cadres in the entire factory have joined the revolutionary mass organizations of the proletariat. Among them, 72% of the deputy section-level and above leading cadres have been respectively arranged in leadership positions for production and business. In the factory's production leadership group, cadres make up 81.8%. This has created favorable conditions for fully implementing the three-in-one combination for the revolution.

The revolutionary workers in this factory had some incorrect understandings regarding the cadre issue. Some believed that those with the title "chief" should all "step aside"; some comrades who had suffered from the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie still had reservations and did not fully trust the cadres.

How to solve these problems? The proletarian revolutionary faction in the factory, with these questions in mind, carefully studied Chairman Mao's works and relevant editorials and articles from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily." They gradually established the belief in trusting and relying on the majority of cadres. They also followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "not only look at a cadre's single act or moment, but also at the cadre's entire history and work." They conducted a comprehensive class analysis of all the cadres in the factory and unanimously agreed that the cadre team in the factory is basically good. Although some cadres had executed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the previous period, it was mainly because a small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party had blocked Chairman Mao's voice, causing them to be deceived. This was an error in understanding. The idea that those with the title "chief" should all step aside and indiscriminately overthrow everyone is extremely wrong. Many comrades said: it is inevitable to make mistakes in work, as long as one truly corrects them, it is good.

Although the correct attitude towards cadres was unified within the proletarian revolutionary faction, many cadres still had many concerns and did not dare to step forward. The revolutionary workers in the factory organized them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, encouraging them to break free from the shackles of "self" and struggle against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. They also, based on the cadres' active thoughts, patiently did a large amount of ideological work. The former chairman of the factory trade union, due to executing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, said some wrong things and did some wrong deeds. Therefore, he had many concerns and fears. The revolutionary mass organization then designated someone to do ideological work with him, repeatedly explaining the policy to him. Through patient help, he finally discarded the "self" and put down his burden, daring to stand up and join the revolution, standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A workshop director had shortcomings and errors in his past work. When he stood up to support the revolutionary faction, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party stirred up the deceived masses in the workshop, grabbing his weaknesses, and intimidating him in various ways. At this critical moment, the revolutionary faction immediately took the initiative to do ideological work with him, helping him to overcome self-interest and serve the public, and enthusiastically encouraged and strongly supported him. This made him stand tall, daring to take on work and heavy responsibilities.

The proletarian revolutionary faction in this factory declared that they will definitely further correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "struggle against self and revisionism" as the key, unite all possible masses and cadres in the struggle, further realize and consolidate the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    在斗私批修中大胆解放干部
    江西船舶修造厂有百分之八十五的干部参加了革命群众组织，其中副科级以上干部大多数已安排在领导岗位上
    据新华社南昌二十八日电　江西船舶修造厂的无产阶级革命派，正确地执行毛主席的干部政策，在“斗私，批修”中，大胆地解放了一大批革命干部，争取和团结了干部的大多数。目前，全厂有百分之八十五的干部参加了无产阶级革命派组织，其中副科级以上的领导干部有百分之七十二已分别安排在生产、业务等领导工作岗位上。厂生产领导小组的成员中，干部占百分之八十一点八。这样，为全面地实现革命的三结合，创造了有利条件。
    这个厂的革命职工在对待干部问题上，曾经出现过一些错误认识。有的认为带“长”字的都应该“靠边站”；受过资产阶级反动路线迫害的同志，有的还同干部存在着隔阂，对干部不够信任。
    怎样来解决这些问题？这个厂的无产阶级革命派带着这些问题，认真学习了毛主席著作和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论和文章，逐步树立了相信和依靠干部的大多数的信念。他们又按照毛主席“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，对全厂的干部进行了全面的阶级分析，一致认为：厂里的干部队伍基本上是好的，他们有的虽然在前一个时期执行了资产阶级反动路线，但主要是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派封锁了毛主席的声音，使他们受了蒙蔽，是属于认识上的错误。那种带“长”字的都应该靠边站，不分青红皂白打倒一切的思想是极端错误的。许多同志说：干工作犯错误是难免的，只要真正改了就好。
    正确对待干部虽然在无产阶级革命派内部统一了认识，但是，有不少干部都顾虑重重，不敢站出来。这个厂的革命职工又组织他们活学活用毛主席著作，鼓励他们摆脱“私”字枷锁，和资产阶级反动路线作斗争，并根据干部的活思想，耐心地对他们进行了大量的思想工作。前厂工会主任由于执行了资产阶级反动路线，说了一些错话，做了一些错事，因此，顾虑重重，怕这怕那。革命群众组织便指定专人做他的思想工作，反复向他交代政策。通过耐心的帮助，终于丢掉了“私”字，放下了包袱，大胆地起来革命，站到毛主席革命路线一边来。有个车间主任过去工作中有缺点和错误，当他站出来支持革命派的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派便挑动车间受蒙蔽的群众，抓住他的小辫子，对他软拉硬压，百般恫吓。在这关键时刻，革命派立即主动找他做思想工作，帮助他破私立公，并且热情鼓励和大力支持他，使他挺起了腰杆，大胆地抓起工作，挑起重担。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派表示，一定要进一步正确执行毛主席的干部政策，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在斗争中团结一切可以团结的群众和干部，进一步实现和巩固革命的大联合和三结合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
