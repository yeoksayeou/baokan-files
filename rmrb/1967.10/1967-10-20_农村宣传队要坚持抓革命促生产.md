After the nationwide summer grain bumper harvest, autumn grain also saw a widespread bumper harvest. At this crucial moment of achieving bumper harvests, rural areas across the country should further implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and genuinely achieve the six excellences in agriculture. All propaganda and performance activities should be based on the principle of raising the ideological and political consciousness of the commune members and promoting production. During these activities, production time should not be occupied, and labor force should not be excessively occupied. We must never forget the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "In any place, human and material resources must be cherished, and it is absolutely not allowed to only consider the present and waste them recklessly."

The two letters raise issues that we hope will attract attention from all places. — Editors

Rural Propaganda Teams Must Insist on Revolution and Production

The amateur propaganda teams in our rural areas are mostly active on the front lines of production. During the day, they participate in rushing to harvest and plant, and during rest times, they perform small-scale cultural activities in the fields and at the threshing grounds. Together with the commune members, they carry out revolutionary criticism, creating a strong political atmosphere in the production teams and boosting the morale of the commune members, greatly promoting the autumn production. Such propaganda teams are warmly praised by the commune members.

However, I have seen that some rural amateur propaganda teams have almost become professional propaganda teams. They occupy production time and a lot of labor force to rehearse large-scale performances, affecting the autumn production. For example, in our commune, one production team mobilized twelve people to rehearse a big play. Sometimes, they even go to other communes with drums and gongs to hold exchange performances, which can last for several nights. The performers cannot participate in normal labor, and those who watch also lack energy the next day for labor. More seriously, the team leader of this production team also participated in the performance, resulting in the team's autumn production being in a state of no leadership, which had a significant impact. I believe this practice goes against Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production" and must be corrected immediately.

I suggest that rural amateur propaganda teams should first study the instructions of the Party Central Committee and relevant commentaries. During the busy autumn season, they should be models of "grasp revolution, promote production" and insist on carrying out small-scale propaganda activities in their spare time locally. This way, it is beneficial for production and also in line with the principle of "thrift for revolution."

### 农村宣传队要坚持抓革命促生产

专栏：革命群众来信

    全国继夏粮大丰收之后，秋粮又获普遍丰收。在这夺取丰产丰收的关键时刻，各地农村应该进一步贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，切实做到农业六好。一切宣传演出活动，都应以提高社员思想政治觉悟，促进生产为原则。在进行这些活动时，不能占用生产时间，不能过多地占用劳动力。我们一时一刻也不能忘记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。”
    这两封来信提出的问题，希望能引起各地的注意。　——编者
　　农村宣传队要坚持抓革命促生产
    我们这里农村的业余宣传队大都活跃在生产第一线，白天参加抢收抢种，休息时间在场头田头演出小型的文娱节目，和社员一起搞革命大批判，把生产队的政治气氛搞得浓浓的，把社员的干劲鼓得足足的，大大地促进了三秋生产。这样的宣传队受到社员们的热情称赞。
    但是，我看到有些农村业余宣传队简直变成了专业宣传队。他们占用生产时间、占用很多劳动力去排演大型节目，影响了三秋生产。例如我们公社有一个生产队就调动了十二个人去排演大戏，有时还敲锣打鼓到别的社队去搞交流会演，一搞就是几个大半夜。演的人不能正常参加劳动，看的人第二天劳动也没精打采。更严重的是这个生产队的队长也去参加演出，结果使队里的三秋生产处于无人领导状态，受到很大影响。我认为这种做法是违背毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示的，必须立即纠正。
    我建议农村业余宣传队首先要很好地学习党中央的指示和有关的社论，在三秋大忙中做“抓革命，促生产”的模范，坚持在业余时间就地搞些小型的宣传活动。这样既利于生产，又符合“节约闹革命”的原则。
