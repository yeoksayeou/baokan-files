Under the direct support of the U.S. imperialists and the indulgence of the Soviet revisionists, the U.S. imperialists' tool of aggression, Israel, has recently intensified serious war provocations against the UAR. This is a continuation of the U.S.-Israeli aggression against the Arab countries in early June and a new vicious plot by the U.S. and Israel to exert military pressure on the Arab countries in an attempt to force them to surrender.

On October 21, the Israeli destroyer "Eilat" invaded the territorial waters of the UAR north of Port Said and was immediately sunk by UAR warships. On the 24th, Israeli invading forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula shelled the port and oil refinery in the UAR city of Suez. In recent days, Israeli aircraft have repeatedly violated the airspace of the UAR. At the same time, Israeli military and political leaders have been issuing war threats. Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol declared on the 26th that the war "has not ended." Israel "must maintain tens of thousands of soldiers, equipped with modern weapons and in a state of mobilization." Dayan, the Israeli defense minister with blood on his hands from the Arab people, boasted that Israel "will know how to deal with" the UAR "as it did five months ago." Israeli Navy Commander Erel raged that he would "settle accounts" with the UAR. The Israeli newspaper "Ha'aretz" bluntly stated on the 25th the aggressive ambitions of the Israeli authorities: "If Egypt thinks that by shelling the Suez refinery yesterday, the account is settled, it is wrong." These war threats are enough to show that Israel, under the direct orders of the U.S., is stirring, preparing to launch a new aggression against the Arab region.

After the U.S.-Israeli aggression in early June this year, they occupied large tracts of Arab lands. But they are not satisfied with this. U.S. imperialism, in order to control this region and extinguish the anti-imperialist flames of the Arab people, has been using various means to force the Arab countries to accept the conditions of surrender. In this conspiracy, the Soviet revisionist leadership is the number one accomplice of the U.S. The U.S. and the Soviet Union collude, acting according to the conspiracy blueprint drawn up by Johnson and Kosygin in Glassboro, engaging in dirty backroom deals in the United Nations under the guise of a "political solution" to the Middle East problem. They throw out one "solution" after another, but the essence remains the same: to force the Arab countries to surrender to Israel. At the same time, Israel closely cooperates, exerting military pressure on the Arab countries on the battlefield, engaging in blackmail and intimidation, and constantly provoking wars. Since the end of September when the United Nations General Assembly convened, Israeli provocations have become more frequent and on a larger scale, from using cannons and tanks to aircraft and warships, from sporadic provocations in one city or town to large-scale provocations in the entire Suez Canal region.

These war provocations are all carried out under the direct support of the U.S. imperialists and the indulgence of the Soviet revisionists. For example, after the Israeli destroyer "Eilat" was sunk by the UAR on October 21 for invading the territorial waters of the UAR, U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey immediately took to the field, falsely accusing the UAR's justified self-defense action against Israeli aggression of "lacking restraint," declaring it to be "regrettable and very unfortunate"; and the U.S. government quickly announced the resumption of arms supplies to Israel, providing a large number of new fighter-bombers. According to the Israeli "Evening News," the U.S. has long trained pilots for these aircraft. As an accomplice of the U.S., the Soviet revisionists have been working hard in the United Nations to cooperate with the U.S., manipulating the passage of resolutions favorable to the U.S. and Israel.

The U.S. imperialists and their tool of aggression, Israel, think they can intimidate the Arab people with war provocations and force them to surrender. However, as the great leader Chairman Mao taught: "The tide of the people of the world opposing the U.S. aggressors is irresistible." The various forms of aggression and oppression by U.S. imperialism will only provoke more intense and widespread resistance from the Arab people.

In recent days, governments and public opinion in various countries have strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists and their running dog, Israel. On the 25th, the official spokesman of the UAR and the chairman of the UAR News Management Committee, Zayyat, accused the U.S. of providing Israel with moral, diplomatic, and military support, encouraging it to launch new aggressions. He said that Israel's recent military provocations and warlike threats all came from Washington or at least were instigated by Washington. Iraqi Defense Minister Shukri said on the 25th that the U.S. announcement of resuming arms supplies to Israel was to strengthen Israel and make up for its weapon shortages. He said, "Israel is a pretext for the U.S. to interfere in the affairs of Arab countries and the Middle East. I believe this policy will arouse hatred for the U.S. around the world. No matter what weapons the U.S. may provide to Israel, a clear fact is that, no matter how long it takes, the Arab people will liberate Palestine." Lebanese Prime Minister Karami said, "We regret (the U.S.) resuming the supply of weapons to the Israeli aggressors." After the Israeli warship violated the territorial waters of the UAR, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Shukairy, said that the members of the Palestine Liberation Organization are determined to carry out guerrilla activities in the areas occupied by Israel.

The Syrian newspaper "Al-Ba'ath" said that the U.S. action of providing weapons to Israel is "to continue Israel's aggression against the Arab countries, which began on June 5, and to implement the imperialist-Zionist plan." Another Syrian newspaper, "Al-Thawra," said that the basic purpose of the U.S. decision is to strengthen Israel's military preparations and encourage it to take new aggressive actions.

In condemning Israel's new aggression, the UAR's "Al-Ahram" said that this shelling "clearly shows how determined Israel is to pursue its hostile and aggressive policy," and "the Arab people will never yield to Israel's policy of threats."

The editorial in the Iraqi newspaper "Voice of the Worker" said that the U.S. resumption of arms supplies to Israel proves that the policy of combining the struggle against Israel and Zionism with the struggle against imperialism led by the U.S. is correct. The editorial pointed out that the only way to completely eliminate the aggressors is to strengthen the anti-imperialist struggle. The Iraqi newspaper "Al-Thawra" condemned Israel's new aggression against the UAR. It warned Israel: it must remember that the Arab people are determined to resist aggression and are prepared to give the enemy a lesson.

### 在美帝直接支持和苏修纵容下  以色列加紧对阿联进行严重战争挑衅  阿拉伯各国政府和舆论愤怒谴责美以侵略活动

    在美帝直接支持和苏修纵容下
    以色列加紧对阿联进行严重战争挑衅
    阿拉伯各国政府和舆论愤怒谴责美以侵略活动
    新华社二十七日讯　在美帝直接支持和苏修纵容下，美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列最近对阿联加紧进行严重的战争挑衅。这是美帝和以色列六月初对阿拉伯国家侵略的继续，是美以对阿拉伯国家施加军事压力以图迫使阿拉伯国家屈膝投降的一个新的恶毒阴谋。
    十月二十一日，以色列驱逐舰“埃拉特号”侵入塞得港以北的阿联领海，当即被阿联军舰击沉。二十四日，以色列侵占西奈半岛的侵略军炮轰阿联苏伊士城的港口和炼油厂等。最近几天，以色列飞机还不断侵入阿联领空。同时，以色列军政头目不断发出战争叫嚣。以色列总理艾希科尔二十六日叫嚷，战争“并没有结束”。以色列“必须维持数以万计的士兵，用现代武器装备起来并处于动员状态”。两手沾满阿拉伯人民鲜血的以色列侵略军头目、国防部长达扬气势汹汹地扬言，以色列“将象五个月以前一样知道如何对付”阿联。以色列海军司令埃雷尔暴跳如雷地说，要同阿联“算账”。以色列《国土报》二十五日更直言不讳地道出以色列当局的侵略野心：“如果埃及认为通过昨天的炮轰苏伊士炼油厂，账就算清了的话，它就错了。”这些战争叫嚣足以说明，受美帝直接指使的以色列正在蠢蠢欲动，准备在阿拉伯地区发动新的侵略战争。
    美以在今年六月初发动侵略战争后，侵占了阿拉伯国家的大片土地。但它们并不以此为满足。美帝国主义为了控制这个地区，扑灭阿拉伯人民的反帝怒火，一直在用各种手段迫使阿拉伯国家接受屈膝投降的条件。在这个阴谋活动中，苏修领导集团是美帝的头号帮凶。美苏勾结在一起，按照约翰逊和柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗制订的勾结蓝图行事，在联合国大搞所谓“政治解决”中东问题的幕后肮脏交易。它们抛出一个又一个“解决”方案，但万变不离其宗，目的都是为了迫使阿拉伯国家向以色列投降。同时，以色列密切地予以配合，在战场上对阿拉伯国家施加军事压力，进行讹诈恫吓，不断进行战争挑衅。自从九月底联合国大会开会以来，以色列的挑衅就更加频繁，规模越来越大，从出动大炮坦克到飞机军舰，从一城一地的零星挑衅发展到在苏伊士运河整个地区的大规模挑衅。
    这些战争挑衅都是在美帝直接支持和苏修纵容之下进行的。如在十月二十一日以色列驱逐舰“埃拉特号”侵入阿联领海而被击沉后，美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基就赤膊上阵，反诬阿联反击以色列侵略的正当的自卫行动为“缺乏克制态度”，叫嚷这是“可悲的、非常令人遗憾的”；而且美国政府很快就宣布恢复向以色列提供军火，给予大批新式战斗轰炸机。据以色列《晚报》透露，美国早就为以色列训练好这些飞机的驾驶员。苏修作为美国的帮凶，在联合国竭力配合美国，操纵通过有利于美国和以色列的“决议”。
    美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列以为可以用战争挑衅来吓倒阿拉伯人民，迫使他们投降。但是，正如伟大领袖毛主席教导的：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。”美帝国主义的各种方式的侵略和压迫必将激起阿拉伯人民更加剧烈、更加广泛的反抗。
    最近以来，各国政府和舆论纷纷愤怒谴责美帝国主义及其走狗以色列。阿联官方发言人、阿联新闻管理委员会主席扎耶特二十五日指责美国给予以色列道义上、外交上和军事上的支持是鼓励它进行新的侵略。他说，以色列最近的军事挑衅和好战的叫嚣都是来自华盛顿或者至少是受到华盛顿的唆使的。伊拉克国防部长舒克里二十五日说，美国宣布恢复向以色列提供军火，是为了加强以色列，补充其武器的不足。他说：“以色列是美国用来干涉阿拉伯国家和中东事务的一个借口。我相信，这种政策将激起世界对美国的痛恨。不管美国可能向以色列增加提供什么武器，一个明显的事实是，不管需要时间长短，阿拉伯人民必将解放巴勒斯坦。”黎巴嫩总理卡拉米说：“我们对于（美国）恢复向以色列侵略者运交武器感到遗憾。”巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里在以色列军舰侵犯阿联领海后发表谈话说，巴勒斯坦解放组织成员决心在以色列占领的地区进行突击队活动。
    叙利亚《复兴报》说，美国向以色列提供武器的行动“是要以色列继续进行它在六月五日开始的对阿拉伯国家的侵略，要它执行帝国主义—犹太复国主义的计划”。叙利亚的另一家报纸《革命报》说，美国的决定的基本目的是为了加强以色列的军事准备并且鼓励它采取新的侵略行动。
    阿联《金字塔报》在谴责以色列的新侵略行动时说，这次炮轰“清楚地说明，以色列是如何坚决地奉行它的敌对和侵略的政策”，“阿拉伯人民绝不向以色列的威胁政策屈服。”
    伊拉克《工人之声报》的评论说，美国恢复向以色列提供军火这件事证明，把反对以色列和犹太复国主义的斗争同反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争结合起来的方针是正确的。评论指出，彻底消灭侵略者的唯一途径，就是要加强反帝斗争。伊拉克《阿拉伯革命报》谴责以色列对阿联的新的侵略行动。它警告以色列：它必须记住，阿拉伯人民决心抵抗侵略，并且准备给予敌人以教训。
