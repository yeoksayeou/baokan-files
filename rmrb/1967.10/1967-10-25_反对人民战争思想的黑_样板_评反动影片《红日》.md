The creators of the reactionary film "Red Sun," in order to cater to the needs of the Chinese Khrushchev clique's anti-party and usurpation of the military, blatantly stand on the bourgeoisie's stance, viciously defame our army, and madly attack Chairman Mao's political line for building the army, fundamentally negating Chairman Mao's thought on people's war.

The film depicts our army's annihilation of the Kuomintang's "elite" 74th Division in the Menglianggu Battle during the War of Liberation. However, from beginning to end, there is not a single part that correctly reflects Chairman Mao's great strategic thought, nor is there a single part that correctly portrays our army's political and ideological work. The film features more than twenty major and minor characters from our army, but not one of them is a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In the film, all the officers are portrayed as fools, and the soldiers as wooden blocks. When our army voluntarily withdrew from Lianhua, a soldier asked the platoon leader why they were withdrawing. The platoon leader, Shi Donggen, shouted, "Don't make noise! Do you think I want to?" Even the battle commander, Shen, did not understand and only knew to report to the commander, requesting punishment. The film portrays our army's officers and soldiers as political mediocrities who do not understand Chairman Mao's strategic thought, which is a great slander against our army.

History is the best witness. Before and after the Lianhua and Menglianggu Battles, I was serving as a political instructor in a certain unit in East China. At that time, we often explained to the soldiers Chairman Mao's strategic thought of "taking the annihilation of the enemy's effective strength as the main goal, not taking the conservation or seizure of cities and places as the main goal." The broad masses of officers and soldiers firmly believed that following Chairman Mao would lead to victory. Although the troops were frequently moved, everyone had no complaints. At that time, we had a machine gunner in our platoon who initially did not understand the frequent troop movements. I helped him carry the machine gun while marching, and along the way, I explained to him how our troops led the enemy by the nose, achieving seven victories in seven battles. He understood and said, "If it's like this, even if my feet wear out, it's worth it." It was based on Chairman Mao's strategic thought that we, with our iron feet, wore out the Kuomintang army.

The film "Red Sun," following the bourgeoisie's line of building the army, defames our soldiers as those who complain, vent their private grievances, and seek revenge, portraying them as bourgeois mercenaries. The platoon leader, Shi Donggen, is a typical example of this defamation. He is casual and has a bandit-like demeanor. After a defeat, he scolds the soldiers; after a victory, he gets drunk. He does not follow policy when dealing with prisoners and violates revolutionary discipline. When requesting a combat mission from the battalion commander, he said, "Fighting a war of attrition, losing money, we have a share, but this time? Seeing others eating fish and meat, we can't even get a sip of soup." This is not what a revolutionary soldier would say. We revolutionary soldiers fight for the liberation of the people and dedicate ourselves to the people's interests, never seeking personal gains. Only those bourgeois careerists see war as an opportunity to expand their power and rise to fame. Shi Donggen's character is a product of the bourgeois military line, a "hero" needed by Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing.

The film "Red Sun" also promotes the bourgeois military line of prioritizing military and technical skills. Before the battle, the battalion commander, Liu Sheng, inspected the troops' training and scolded a new soldier who did not shoot well. However, another new soldier, Wang Maosheng, because he shot accurately, was praised by the platoon leader, Shi Donggen, as "our platoon's treasure," and the battalion commander, Liu Sheng, also called on everyone to "learn from him." This is the same as Luo Ruiqing's slogan, "We have airplanes and cannons, and if we can shoot accurately and operate them, that is the army's combat effectiveness and can win battles." Luo Ruiqing organized large-scale competitions, using military training to impact political and ideological work. The film's creators exaggerated the pre-battle training and competitions, using them as important indicators of the battle's "turning point." Their malicious intent is not obvious?

Our army has always followed Chairman Mao's teachings, placing political and ideological work at the forefront of all work. Whether on the long march or in the trenches, we always seize every opportunity to understand the troops' thoughts, conduct battle mobilization, and class education, inspiring the officers and soldiers' fighting spirit. Especially during the transition of battles or changes in the situation, the leadership must explain the intentions, promote military democracy, so that everyone has a clear mind, is full of confidence, and is eager to face new battles. Our army has never been as chaotic, discouraged, complaining, and disorganized as described in the film.

The creators of the film completely negate Chairman Mao's principles of political building of the army and negate our army's political and ideological work, fundamentally negating Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. They cater to the needs of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, creating a bourgeois model of building the army that emphasizes military over party leadership and promotes the "one-commander system." Moreover, they maliciously portray it as the "heroic" unit that annihilated the enemy's 74th Division, attempting to prove that our army's victories are not achieved through Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing politics, but through emphasizing military; that the army's construction is through the path of emphasizing military, not emphasizing politics. Their purpose of opposing the emphasis on politics and promoting the emphasis on military is to replace proletarian politics with bourgeois politics, attempting to turn our army into a bourgeois army, thereby seizing military power from the proletariat.

Nonsense! This is a futile dream that will never come true! The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great people's army created and led by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. Our army will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The creators of the reactionary film "Red Sun" and their black backers, the Chinese Khrushchev, will never succeed in their plot to oppose the People's Liberation Army!

    反对人民战争思想的黑“样板”
    ——评反动影片《红日》
    原华东三级人民英雄　朱兆恒
    反动影片《红日》的编导者，为了适应中国赫鲁晓夫之流的反党篡军需要，公然站在资产阶级的立场上，恶毒地丑化我军，疯狂地攻击毛主席的政治建军路线，从根本上否定毛主席的人民战争思想。
    影片描写的是我军在解放战争中全歼蒋匪“王牌”七十四师的孟良崮战役，但是从头到尾没有一处正确反映毛主席的伟大战略思想，没有一处正确表现我军的政治思想工作。影片写了我军大大小小二十多个人物，却没有一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士形象。在影片中，所有的干部都是糊涂蛋，战士都是死木头。当我军主动撤离涟水时，战士问连长为什么要撤，连长石东根大喝一声：“不要吵，你当我愿意！”作为战役指挥员的沈军长也很不理解，只知道向司令员打报告，请求处分。影片把我军指战员描绘成不懂毛主席战略思想的政治庸人，这是对我军的极大诬蔑。
    历史是最好的见证。涟水战役和孟良崮战役前后，我就在华东某部队担任政治指导员工作。当时，我们常向战士讲解毛主席的“以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守或夺取城市和地方为主要目标”这个战略思想。广大指战员坚信跟着毛主席就是胜利，虽然部队调动频繁，大家都毫无怨言。那时我们连有个机枪手，开始对部队来回调动还不很理解。我就在行军时帮他扛机枪，一路走，一路谈，谈我们部队怎么牵着敌人鼻子走，取得了七战七捷的胜利。他听了心头开了窍，说：“要这样，脚板走穿也值得。”我们就是根据毛主席的战略思想，硬凭一双铁脚板，把蒋匪军拖垮吃掉的。
    影片《红日》按照资产阶级的建军思想，把我们的战士丑化为发牢骚、泄私愤、图报复的资产阶级雇佣军。连长石东根就是一个被丑化了的典型。他吊儿郎当，一身匪气。打了败仗“训”战士，打了胜仗发酒疯，对待俘虏不讲政策，破坏革命纪律。他向团长请求战斗任务时说：“打消耗战，赔本，有咱们的份，可这回呢？眼看着人家吃鱼吃肉的，咱们连口汤也喝不上。”这哪里象革命战士讲的话。我们革命战士为人民解放而战斗，为人民利益而献身，从不图谋小集团的私利，只有那些资产阶级野心家，才把打仗看成是扩张势力，飞黄腾达的机会。石东根这个形象是不折不扣的资产阶级军事路线的产儿，是彭德怀、罗瑞卿所需要的“英雄”。
    影片《红日》还宣扬军事第一、技术第一的资产阶级军事路线。团长刘胜视察战前练兵，看到一个新战士没打好靶，就开口斥责；而另一个新战士王茂生却因为枪打得准，连长石东根就把他捧为“我们连的宝贝”，团长刘胜也号召大家“要好好向他学习”。这同罗瑞卿所叫嚷的“我们有飞机大炮，再加上打得准，开得动，就是军队的战斗力，就能打胜仗”，完全是一路货色。罗瑞卿搞大比武，让练武冲击政治思想工作。影片的编导者大肆渲染战前练兵、比武，并把它作为战斗“转折”的重要标志来突出。这种恶毒的用心，不是昭然若揭吗？
    我军历来遵循毛主席的教导，把政治思想工作放在一切工作的首位。无论在漫长的行军路上，还是在战火纷飞的堑壕里，我们总是抓紧点滴时间了解部队思想情况，进行战斗动员和阶级教育，激发指战员的战斗热情。尤其在战役转换或战局变化的时候，领导更要讲清意图，发扬军事民主，使得人人心里有底，信心百倍，斗志昂扬地去迎接新的战斗。我军从来没有象影片描写的那种混乱、沮丧，怨天尤人，丧魂失魄，溃不成军的样子。
    影片的编导者完全否定毛主席政治建军的原则，否定我军政治思想工作，也就从根本上否定了毛主席的人民战争思想。他们适应了中国赫鲁晓夫和他在军队的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿的反党篡军需要，塑造了一个突出军事，不要党的领导，推行“一长制”的资产阶级建军“样板”。而且他们还恶毒地把它标榜为消灭敌七十四师的“英雄”部队，妄图以此证明：我军的胜利不是靠毛泽东思想、靠突出政治取得的，而是靠突出军事；部队建设是走突出军事的道路，而不是走突出政治的道路。他们反对突出政治，鼓吹突出军事的目的，就是要以资产阶级政治挤掉无产阶级政治，妄想使我军蜕化为资产阶级军队，从而把军权从无产阶级手中夺取过去。
    呸！这是痴心妄想，永远办不到！中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林彪同志亲自指挥的伟大的人民军队。我们的军队永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线。反动影片《红日》的编导者和他们的黑后台中国的赫鲁晓夫反对人民解放军的阴谋是永远不会得逞的！
