Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved teacher of 700 million Chinese people, it will lead the Chinese people to new victories. Vital said: "We, the people of the Congo, would like to take this opportunity to express our most resolute support for the changes brought about by the Cultural Revolution and the changes brought about by the influence of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle of the people of all countries against colonialism and all evil forces."

	An audience member named Mao Bei Er said after visiting the exhibition that Mao Zedong Thought is not only a beacon for the Chinese people but also a guiding light for the revolutionary people of all countries.

	A student named Manamba Leon wrote in the guest book: Chairman Mao is our most beloved teacher. Your thoughts illuminate the world. Millions of people's hearts are connected with you.

	A Congolese worker said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people of all countries. Chairman Mao stands on the side of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people. Revolutionary people love Chairman Mao endlessly."

	A national militia soldier named Benla John wrote in the guest book: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the true advance of the socialist revolution. Everything happening in China now makes the American imperialists and their running dogs tremble.

	Another soldier, Enkoma, said: "The great Chinese people have set a unique example. This example can guide revolutionary people to a path of progress and socialism. Let the revolutionary people of the world follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao!"

	Many audience members enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"
