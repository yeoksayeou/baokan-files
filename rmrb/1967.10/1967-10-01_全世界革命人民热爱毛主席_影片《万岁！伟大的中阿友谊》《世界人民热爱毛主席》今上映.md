The people of the world who love revolution all cherish Chairman Mao. The documentary films "Long Live the Great Sino-Albanian Friendship" and "The World's People Love Chairman Mao" will be released today.

Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: Just as the friendly envoys from various countries are celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with our people, the documentary films "Long Live the Great Sino-Albanian Friendship," which reflects the visit of the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble to China, and "The World's People Love Chairman Mao" (Part 2), which reflects the Congolese (Brazzaville) people's boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have been completed by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. Starting from October 1st, they will be screened in Beijing, Shanghai, and other parts of the country in succession.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao, has shaken the world. People of various countries have felt the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought from the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and have seen more clearly their own revolutionary path of victory from the inspiring victory songs of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They yearn for New China, look towards Beijing, and turn their hearts towards Chairman Mao. They strive to learn and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works and send their representatives to visit our country, enthusiastically supporting our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and seeking revolutionary truth. These two films are moving poems that record the revolutionary friendship between our people and the people of various countries in the world as they enter a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner.

In the film "Long Live the Great Sino-Albanian Friendship," the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, forged on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is always overflowing. The Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble visited our country in December last year, at a time when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was deeply developing. They brought with them the deep affection of the Albanian people for their most beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the closest comrade of the Chinese people, and gave strong support to our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On stage, they enthusiastically sang the praises of the great victories achieved by the Albanian people under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and sang revolutionary battle songs such as "The Plot of Revisionism Has Failed." They visited various places in our country to see the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and with revolutionary passion, they sang songs praising our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, such as "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" and "We Should Believe in the Masses, We Should Believe in the Party." Throughout their performances and visits in our country, scenes of moving friendship between the peoples of China and Albania appeared everywhere, and the shouts of "Enver-Hoxha, Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong-Enver" echoed everywhere.

In the film "The World's People Love Chairman Mao" (Part 2), one can see the moving historical scene of our great leader Chairman Mao receiving Congolese (Brazzaville) trainees on July 11th this year. The Congolese (Brazzaville) trainees who were received by Chairman Mao, like the broad masses of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people, cherish boundless love for Mao Zedong, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. They have long insisted on learning and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant works. The film not only deeply and truly records these moving scenes but also expresses the revolutionary sentiments of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people's boundless love for Chairman Mao and his works. A Congolese (Brazzaville) friend once wrote in a poem: "This red book of Mao Zedong, it is a book of truth, it educates all the oppressed peoples of the world, it illuminates the path of the world's people, study it, study it every day, study it with all your heart, it is a precious book for the twentieth-century Marxist-Leninist warriors, a must-read book."

    全世界革命人民热爱毛主席
    影片《万岁！伟大的中阿友谊》《世界人民热爱毛主席》今上映
    新华社三十日讯　正当世界各国人民的友好使者同我国人民一起欢度中华人民共和国建国十八周年光辉节日的时候，反映阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团访问中国的纪录影片《万岁！伟大的中阿友谊》和反映刚果（布）人民无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的纪录影片《世界人民热爱毛主席》（第二辑），已由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制完成，十月一日起分别在北京、上海和全国各地陆续上映。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，震撼了全世界。世界各国人民从毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利中，进一步感受到毛泽东思想战无不胜的强大威力，从我国无产阶级文化大革命激动人心的凯歌声中，更加认清了自己革命的胜利道路。他们向往新中国，眼望北京城，心向毛主席，努力学习和运用毛主席的光辉著作，并且派出自己的代表来到我国访问，热情地支持我国的无产阶级文化大革命和探求革命的真理。这两部影片，就是全世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代里，纪录我国人民和世界各国人民之间的革命友谊的又一动人诗篇。
    在影片《万岁！伟大的中阿友谊》里，始终洋溢着中阿两国人民在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上凝结的战斗友情。阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团在去年十二月来我国访问，正是我国无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的时候。他们满载着阿尔巴尼亚人民最敬爱的领袖、中国人民最亲密的战友恩维尔·霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民的深情厚谊来到我国，对我国无产阶级文化大革命给予最有力的支持。他们在舞台上纵情歌颂阿尔巴尼亚人民在恩维尔·霍查同志领导下社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的伟大胜利，高唱《修正主义的阴谋破产了》等革命战歌。他们到我国各地访问无产阶级文化大革命运动胜利开展的情况，满怀着革命激情欢唱歌颂我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席语录歌《我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党》。他们在我国演出和访问的过程中，到处出现了洋溢着中阿两国人民战斗友谊的动人场面，到处响彻着“恩维尔—毛泽东，毛泽东—恩维尔”的欢呼声。
    在影片《世界人民热爱毛主席》（第二辑）中，人们可以看到我们伟大的领袖毛主席今年七月十一日接见刚果（布）实习生的激动人心的历史场景。受到毛主席接见的刚果（布）实习生们，同刚果（布）广大人民一样，怀着对世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的无限热爱，很早以前就坚持学习和运用毛主席的光辉著作。影片不仅深刻而真实地纪录了这些动人的情景，而且表达了刚果（布）人民无限热爱毛主席和毛主席著作的革命心声。一位刚果（布）朋友曾在诗中写道：“毛泽东这本红书啊，它是认识真理的书，它教育着世界一切被压迫的人民，它照亮着世界人民的路程，学习吧，天天学，用心学，它是二十世纪马列主义战士珍贵的书，必读的书。”
