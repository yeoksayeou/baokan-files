The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China strongly protests the Indonesian reactionary government's organization of thugs to attack and destroy the Chinese Embassy. We warn the Indonesian reactionary government to immediately stop anti-China activities. The Chinese government has decided to immediately dispatch a special plane to Jakarta to bring back the seriously injured Chinese diplomatic personnel.

New China News Agency, October 5th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on the 5th, strongly protesting the Indonesian reactionary government's organization of Indonesian armed military police and a large number of thugs to crazily attack and destroy the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, once again strongly protesting this fascist atrocity.

The note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China atrocity completely exposed the Indonesian reactionaries' plot to thoroughly sabotage the relations between the two countries.

The Chinese government stated in the note: "You have repeatedly armed and attacked the Chinese Embassy, crazily infringing upon the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy and the personal safety of Chinese diplomatic personnel. You must bear full responsibility for this fascist crime and all its consequences."

The note said that from 3:00 AM to 8:30 AM on October 1st, 1967, the Indonesian reactionary government once again organized Indonesian armed military police and a large number of thugs to crazily attack and destroy the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, creating an unprecedented fascist atrocity in the history of international relations. More than a thousand fascist thugs, under the protection of Indonesian armed military police, brutally attacked and beat twenty unarmed Chinese diplomatic and staff members, even opening fire. All twenty members of the embassy were injured. Acting Charge d'Affaires Huang Wensheng and several others were shot, with serious injuries. The thugs also burned and smashed all the equipment, cars, and other public and private property of the Chinese Embassy, stealing the embassy's radio, documents, archives, and a large amount of property. The thugs not only burned the Chinese national flag but also burned portraits of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world revolution, and the Quotations from Chairman Mao.

The note said that after this bloody incident, the Indonesian reactionary government sent armed troops to surround and blockade the Chinese Embassy, hoisted the Indonesian national flag in the embassy courtyard, and deprived the embassy personnel of their personal freedom, cut off all telecommunications between the embassy and the Chinese government, obstructed all diplomatic activities of the embassy, and even extremely arrogantly "cancelled" the embassy's National Day reception. The water, electricity, and gas supply to the embassy were also completely cut off, truly reaching the extreme of savagery and barbarism.

The note pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government deliberately chose the great festival of the Chinese people—the National Day—to create this new fascist atrocity, which is an extremely serious provocation to the great People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. The Chinese government had made the most urgent and strongest verbal protest to the Indonesian government on October 1st. However, up to today, the Chinese Embassy is still unable to contact its own government and continues to suffer savage persecution from the Indonesian reactionaries. The injured personnel are still in a critical condition and have not received proper treatment and care; the normal activities of the embassy are still completely restricted. For this, the Chinese government once again strongly protests to the Indonesian reactionary government.

The Chinese government sternly demands that the Indonesian government:

"1. Immediately publicly apologize for the above incident, severely punish the criminals, and compensate for all the losses of the Chinese Embassy; 2. Take full responsibility for the treatment of the injured Chinese diplomatic and staff members, and report their condition and treatment to the Chinese government in detail; 3. Immediately withdraw the armed blockade and siege of the Chinese Embassy, and ensure that the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy are no longer infringed upon; 4. Ensure the normal operation of telecommunications between the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese government; 5. Restore the water, electricity, and gas supply to the Chinese Embassy, and guarantee the living conditions of the embassy personnel."

The Chinese government announced in the note: "Before receiving a satisfactory response from the Indonesian government to the above demands, we reserve the right to take all necessary measures."

New China News Agency, October 5th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on the 5th, demanding that the embassy immediately notify the Indonesian government: The Chinese government has decided to immediately dispatch a special plane to Jakarta to bring back the Chinese diplomatic personnel who were severely injured by the Indonesian reactionary government's organized military police and thugs on October 1st; the Indonesian government must provide the necessary facilities and respond as quickly as possible, without delay or obstruction.

The note said that on October 1st, 1967, the Indonesian reactionary government organized a large number of military police and thugs to carry out an unprecedented savage attack on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. In this extremely serious incident, all twenty members of the Chinese Embassy were beaten and injured, some seriously. Acting Charge d'Affaires Huang Wensheng was shot by an armed soldier and is still in a dangerous condition. The note said that due to the injured personnel not receiving proper treatment and care, the Chinese government has decided to immediately dispatch a special plane to Jakarta to bring back the Chinese Acting Charge d'Affaires and other seriously injured personnel. Two Chinese medical personnel and one interpreter will accompany the plane to provide care. The Indonesian government must provide the necessary facilities and respond as quickly as possible, without delay or obstruction.

    我外交部最强烈抗议印尼反动政府组织暴徒袭击和捣毁我使馆
    警告印尼反动政府必须立即停止反华活动
    我政府决定立即派专机前往雅加达接回我受重伤外交人员
    新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部五日照会印尼驻华大使馆，就印尼反动政府又一次组织印尼武装军警和大批暴徒疯狂袭击和捣毁中国驻印尼大使馆的法西斯暴行，再次向印尼反动政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    中国外交部的照会指出，印尼反动政府这一反华暴行，完全暴露了印尼反动派蓄意彻底破坏两国关系的阴谋企图。
    中国政府在照会中严正警告印尼反动政府：“你们一次又一次地武装袭击中国大使馆，疯狂侵犯中国大使馆的外交特权和中国外交人员的人身安全，你们必须对这一法西斯罪行及其一切后果承担全部责任。”
    照会说，一九六七年十月一日凌晨三时到八时三十分，印尼反动政府又一次组织印尼武装军警和大批暴徒，疯狂袭击和捣毁了中国驻印尼大使馆，制造了国际关系史上最罕见的法西斯暴行。一千多名法西斯暴徒，在印尼武装军警保护下，竟然对手无寸铁的二十名中国外交和工作人员，进行残暴的围攻毒打，甚至开枪射击。大使馆二十名人员全部受伤。临时代办黄文胜等数人中弹，伤势严重。暴徒们还烧砸了中国大使馆的全部设备、汽车和其他公私财物，抢走了大使馆发报机、文件、档案和大量财物。暴徒们不但烧毁中国国旗，而且还烧毁了中国人民和世界革命人民最伟大领袖毛泽东主席的画像和毛主席语录。
    照会说，在这一血腥事件之后，印尼反动政府又派出武装部队包围和封锁了中国大使馆，在大使馆院内扯起印尼国旗，并剥夺了大使馆人员的人身自由，切断了大使馆同中国政府的一切电讯联系，阻挠大使馆的一切外交活动，甚至极端狂妄地由印尼政府出面“取消”了大使馆的国庆招待会。大使馆的水、电和煤气供应也被全部断绝，真是残暴野蛮到了极点。
    照会指出，印尼反动政府特意选择在中国人民的伟大节日——国庆节，制造这一新的法西斯暴行，是对伟大的中华人民共和国和中国人民极端严重的挑衅。对此，中国政府曾于十月一日向印尼政府提出最紧急、最强烈的口头抗议。但是，到今天为止，中国大使馆仍然无法同本国政府取得联系，而且继续遭到印尼反动派的野蛮迫害。受伤人员仍然处于危急状态，得不到应有的治疗和护理；大使馆的正常活动仍然全部受到无理限制。为此，中国政府再次向印尼反动政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    中国政府在照会中严正要求印尼政府：
    “一、立即就上述事件公开道歉，严惩凶犯，赔偿中国大使馆的一切损失；二、切实负责治疗受伤的中国外交和工作人员，并将他们的伤情和治疗情况向中国政府作出详细交代；三、立即撤销对中国大使馆的武装包围和封锁，保证中国大使馆的外交特权不再受到侵犯；四、保证中国大使馆同中国政府的电讯联络的正常进行；五、恢复对中国大使馆的水、电和煤气等供应，保障大使馆人员应有的生活条件。”
    中国政府在照会中宣布：“在未接到印尼政府对上述要求作出圆满答复之前，保留采取一切必要措施的权利。”
    新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部五日照会印尼驻华大使馆，要求大使馆立即通知印尼政府：中国政府决定立即派专机前往雅加达，接回在十月一日被印尼反动政府组织的军警、暴徒毒打受重伤的中国外交人员；印尼政府必须提供必要的便利，并最迅速地予以答复，不得拖延和阻挠。
    照会说，一九六七年十月一日，印尼反动政府组织大批军警、暴徒，对中国驻印尼大使馆进行了空前野蛮的袭击。在这次极其严重的事件中，中国大使馆全部人员二十名都被毒打受伤，有的伤势严重，临时代办黄文胜被武装军人枪击重伤，迄今仍处于危险状态。照会说，由于受伤人员得不到应有的治疗和护理，中国政府现决定，立即派专机前往雅加达，接回中国临时代办和其他重伤人员。中国医务人员二名和译员一名将随机前往照料。对此，印尼政府必须提供必要的便利，并最迅速地予以答复，不得加以拖延和阻挠。
