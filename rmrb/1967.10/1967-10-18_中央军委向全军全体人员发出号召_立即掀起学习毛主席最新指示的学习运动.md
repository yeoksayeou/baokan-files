The Central Military Commission has issued a call to all military personnel to immediately launch a study movement of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The great leader Chairman Mao made a series of extremely important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China. These instructions are great historical documents of Marxism-Leninism. They are the most scientific, complete, profound, and thorough summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and more. They are the beacon guiding the entire Party, the nation, and the military to advance bravely. They are the newest and most powerful ideological weapon to ensure the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All military personnel must resolutely carry out these instructions, word for word and letter for letter.

Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were disseminated nationwide, the broad revolutionary masses have launched a new high tide of studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Recently, the Central Military Commission issued a notice calling on all military personnel to immediately launch a study movement of the extremely important instructions made by the great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China.

The notice said: At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected North China, Central China, and East China and made a series of extremely important instructions on the need to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, to further promote revolutionary great alliances, revolutionary three-in-ones, and to establish study classes, among others. Chairman Mao's instructions are great historical documents of Marxism-Leninism. They are the most scientific, complete, profound, and thorough summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and more. They are the beacon guiding the entire Party, the nation, and the military to advance bravely. They are the newest and most powerful ideological weapon to ensure the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All military personnel must resolutely carry out these instructions, word for word and letter for letter.

The notice said: All units must, in accordance with the CPC Central Committee's notice on studying Chairman Mao's important instructions, immediately disseminate these instructions to all personnel (including all cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members) in their original form, ensuring that everyone knows them. Immediately launch a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's important instructions. This is the most central task at present.

The notice said: All levels of Party committees must hold special meetings, allocate sufficient time, and use the important instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao as a weapon to seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement. In light of the actual situation in their regions and units, they must formulate practical and feasible specific measures to ensure that Chairman Mao's important instructions are fully implemented. The entire military must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage.

The notice said: Units tasked with "three supports and two militaries" must organize forces to go deep into factories, rural areas, and schools, and conduct extensive propaganda among the masses. They must also study with the masses and jointly implement these instructions.
