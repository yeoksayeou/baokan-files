The New China News Agency, Hanoi, October 19 — According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the military and civilian population of the central and southern regions of South Vietnam, as well as the New An-Di An area near Saigon, have made significant advances in September, launching fierce attacks against the enemy and eliminating over 5,000 enemy personnel, including nearly 2,500 American invaders.

In September, the military and civilian population of the central and southern regions continuously attacked the enemy's important strategic transportation lines and rear bases. They killed, wounded, and captured over 3,780 enemy personnel, including more than 1,900 American invaders. They destroyed or damaged 86 armored vehicles and other military vehicles, sank or damaged 48 military ships, shot down or damaged 28 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or forced the enemy to withdraw from 26 outposts and bunkers. The number of American invaders, military vehicles, military ships, and enemy aircraft eliminated in this region in September was double that of August.

The report states that in September, the military and civilian population of My Tho Province excelled in battles along Highway 4. The entire province's military and civilian population once made Highway 4 impassable for ten consecutive days and crushed a sweep operation by 15,000 enemy troops, eliminating over 2,000 enemy personnel, including 1,145 American invaders.

The report also mentions that, in addition to My Tho Province, the military and civilian population of various provinces in the central and southern regions cut off 26 enemy roads in September, particularly the road from Go Cong to Saigon, which was cut off for nearly a month. The guerrilla forces in My Tho, Long An, and Ben Tre Provinces also frequently attacked enemy transport ships on various rivers, cutting off waterway transportation.

The report states that in September, the military and civilian population of the central and southern regions not only achieved victories in anti-sweep operations but also penetrated deep into the enemy's rear bases to attack and eliminate the enemy. The People's Liberation Armed Forces launched successive attacks on the cities and towns of Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, Xuan Loc, Trung Luong, and Ba Tri.

The report states that guerrilla warfare in the central and southern regions also developed in September. Local guerrilla forces attacked roads, blew up bridges, and assaulted "strategic hamlets," eliminating over 500 enemy personnel.

In September, the military and civilian population of the New An-Di An area actively launched multiple attacks against the enemy, killing and wounding 1,277 enemy personnel, including 541 American soldiers. They captured and destroyed 8 enemy outposts and sentry posts, blew up 6 bridges, destroyed 13 military vehicles, sank 3 ships, and shot down 7 enemy aircraft.
