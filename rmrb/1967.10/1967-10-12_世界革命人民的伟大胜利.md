One year ago, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in China, many comrades, including myself, lacked a correct and profound understanding of the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong. At that time, we did not realize that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China was not only related to the future and destiny of the People's Republic of China but also to the destiny of the proletarian revolution worldwide and the liberation of all oppressed and exploited peoples worldwide. At that time, we did not deeply understand that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two lines—the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

We studied the documents of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, learned from the speeches of Comrade Lin Biao and Premier Zhou Enlai at the rally celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on August 18 last year, read important articles about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution published in the People's Daily, Liberation Army Daily, Red Flag, and other newspapers, and exchanged views with Chinese Red Guards and other revolutionary masses. Most importantly, we personally participated in various meetings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After all these experiences, we gained a more profound understanding of the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was then that we gradually realized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution taking place in China was a great joy for all peoples and proletarian revolutionaries worldwide.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution saved the proletarian revolution worldwide and the revolution of all peoples worldwide from being betrayed by the revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership. This is the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Why do we say that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution saved the revolution of all peoples worldwide? Why do we say that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great joy for all peoples worldwide?

There are many reasons. But the most important ones are as follows:

1. Contemporary Marxism-Leninism, represented by Mao Zedong Thought, has spread throughout the world and is beginning to be grasped by all peoples worldwide.
2. The bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev has been destroyed, and the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries, who have been hoping day and night for the restoration of capitalism in China, have seen their beautiful dreams shattered.
3. China—the base of world revolution—will forever remain red and will be even more consolidated.
4. The future of the world revolution is even more brilliant.

I believe that the reason why we say the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great joy for all peoples worldwide is precisely because of these points. The reason why we say that this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not just a matter for the 700 million people of China but also a matter for the peoples of the world lies in these points. Similarly, the reason why revolutionary peoples worldwide are enthusiastically welcoming and supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and enthusiastically celebrating the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution also lies in these points.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices did their utmost to prevent the spread and promotion of Mao Zedong Thought among the 700 million people of China and all peoples worldwide. This is an unforgivable crime against the peoples of the world. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the obstacles set up by the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Chinese Communist Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, were removed, and the movement to spread, promote, study, and apply Mao Zedong Thought flourished. Revolutionary peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world are generally studying and applying the sharpest weapon for struggle—Mao Zedong Thought—to walk the Chinese path, the path of people's war, the only path to liberation. This has become an irresistible historical trend that no force can stop. This is the first great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and, at the same time, a great victory for all peoples worldwide.

The correctness of Chairman Mao's teachings has been proven by the practice of the Chinese revolution and the revolutionary practice of the peoples of the world. It has been proven by the successful experiences and lessons of the world's revolutionary struggles. Chairman Mao has led all Marxist-Leninists worldwide in theory and practice. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. All these facts prove that Chairman Mao is the most outstanding proletarian leader of our time, the greatest and most brilliant genius of our time.

Undoubtedly, it is precisely because of Chairman Mao's leadership and the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that it has been possible to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to prevent the restoration of capitalism, uproot revisionism, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without Chairman Mao's leadership, without the sharpest weapon grasped by the Chinese people—Mao Zedong Thought, and without the People's Liberation Army of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought under Chairman Mao's leadership, it would have been impossible to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is unthinkable that there could have been a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution without Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, said, "To carry out this cultural revolution well, what do we rely on? We rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought, on the wisdom and strength of the masses!"

From another perspective, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution itself is an unprecedented great movement. In this movement, hundreds of millions of people study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and a guiding principle for every action. It is a great cause to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. In the international communist movement, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great movement in which hundreds of millions of people grasp Mao Zedong Thought. It makes Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions and turn into a great material force. This force can break old things, smash rotten and reactionary things, overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power, and establish proletarian ideology. The great movement itself is a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only about spreading Mao Zedong Thought among the 700 million people of China but also about spreading and promoting Mao Zedong Thought to all revolutionary peoples worldwide. Through their own struggles, the peoples of the world have come to recognize and believe that Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party clearly stated and correctly pointed out in its statement on May 23, 1967:

"The revolutionary peoples of Indonesia and all revolutionary peoples worldwide jointly enthusiastically acclaim the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese people. Mao Zedong Thought has solved a series of theoretical and practical problems of class struggle in socialist society, guaranteed the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, and prevented the restoration of capitalism. Thus, Mao Zedong Thought has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. As the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought points the way to liberation and the achievement of socialism for all revolutionary peoples worldwide. Mao Zedong Thought is an inexhaustible source of inspiration for the struggles of oppressed peoples and a great guiding principle for all Marxist-Leninists in their large-scale struggle against modern revisionism. Indonesian Marxist-Leninists unhesitatingly acknowledge that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism and are determined to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, using it as a sharp weapon to struggle for the liberation of Indonesia. The path of people's war indicated by Comrade Mao is an inevitable path for the liberation struggle of Indonesia."

The statement of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party fully reflects the feelings and aspirations of the Indonesian people, who are fighting under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party to overthrow the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution and are engaged in a long-term armed struggle. The statement of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party further indicates: Under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party, the conclusion and unanimous resolution of the Indonesian people are to achieve revolutionary victory, it is necessary to raise high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great victory for Indonesian Marxist-Leninists and the Indonesian people. In a special sense, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought within the Indonesian Communist Party, achieved through the fierce struggle of Indonesian Marxist-Leninists, is also a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great contribution of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the Indonesian people.

The broad revolutionary masses in China, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposed and finally destroyed the traitors and old counter-revolutionaries hidden within the Party and state organs of China—the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev. This is a great victory, a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and a victory for all revolutionary peoples worldwide. It is another significant contribution to the international communist movement and the world's revolutionary peoples.

The Chinese Khrushchev, the head of this hidden bourgeois headquarters, has always opposed the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and is the most dangerous enemy of the Chinese people and the dictatorship of the proletariat in China. He and his accomplices, as Chairman Mao said, "are like Khrushchev, sleeping next to us." As Chairman Mao pointed out, if the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices had not been exposed and overthrown, "it would not take much time, a few years or a dozen years, or even a few decades, to inevitably see a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist party would definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China would change color." From this, we can see how important the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is and how great its main task is. To complete the prevention of the restoration of capitalism and the eradication of revisionism, it is necessary to thoroughly destroy the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

The task set by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as the fierce and complex struggle initiated by the proletarian headquarters under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, is Chairman Mao's greatest creative contribution to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and a creative development of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The conspiracy activities of the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev are not only heinous crimes against the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese people but also great crimes against the revolutionary cause and struggles of the peoples of all countries. The bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev opposed the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and opposed Mao Zedong Thought, which in essence is to oppose the revolution, oppose the truth, and oppose the cause of liberation for all humanity.

The head of the bourgeois headquarters, the Chinese Khrushchev, not only wanted to restore capitalism in China and become a "red" comprador, actively engaging in activities, but also wanted to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the peoples of all countries. He and his bourgeois headquarters spread various bankrupt theories of the "peaceful" road to socialism, various traitorous theories, and slander armed struggle. He also spread various traitorous theories of cooperating with reactionaries and surrendering to imperialism and its lackeys. He wanted the Burmese people to lay down their arms and surrender to the Burmese reactionaries.

When the Chinese Khrushchev visited Indonesia in April 1963, he desperately praised the class cooperation policy of the Indonesian Communist Party, as shown in the "Nasakom" path, and the policy of following the bourgeoisie. He even expressed that it would be beneficial for the Indonesian Communist Party to have more people become ministers in the government, to accumulate more experience in managing the state. He also praised the reactionary alliance of Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia that the reactionaries were then trying to form.

The Chinese Khrushchev and the Soviet Khrushchev are essentially birds of a feather, but in actual actions, the Chinese Khrushchev is more dangerous because he has long been waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. With cunning methods, he opposed Chairman Mao's brilliant judgments such as "all reactionaries are paper tigers," "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," "without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people," "in class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable, and without them, the leap in social development cannot be completed..." and so on. He everywhere vigorously peddled his traitorous philosophy.

The great Chinese people and revolutionary peoples of all countries, using Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, exposed and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev, condemned and opposed his revisionist goods. This is another victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The thorough exposure of the Chinese Khrushchev has made the beautiful dream of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries to restore capitalism in China completely shattered.

Since Khrushchev seized the leadership of the Soviet Party and state, he has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the great Lenin, betrayed proletarian internationalism, betrayed the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations, and betrayed the interests of the great Soviet people and the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The Soviet Union, during the period of leadership by Lenin and Stalin, was the first proletarian dictatorship in the world and the hope and trust of the proletariat and all oppressed peoples worldwide. Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership has changed the color of the Soviet Union, turning the proletarian dictatorship of the Soviet Union into a bourgeois dictatorship. The Soviet revisionist leadership in Moscow is a counter-revolutionary center outside Washington. Those countries that follow Soviet modern revisionism have changed their socialist color and have become countries of capitalist restoration. Several communist parties, such as those in France, Italy, India, and the United States, have become followers of Khrushchev and have degenerated into revisionist parties.

In such a situation, the great Communist Party of China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the banner of revolution, and the banner of fighting against imperialism and its running dogs. It has stood at the forefront of the struggle, leading Marxist-Leninists and the peoples of the world to oppose the treacherous acts of modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership. Chairman Mao's creative contributions to the world communist movement are immeasurable. In the above situation, if there had been no Chairman Mao, no great Mao Zedong Thought, and no powerful People's Republic of China, it is difficult to imagine what the world would have been like and what the fate of the world revolution would have been.

The magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has strengthened the fierce counterattack of Marxist-Leninists against modern revisionists. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has once again shown that China is the center and base of the world revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on two fronts, has launched a great struggle of historic significance against the reactionaries and modern revisionists, that is, on the domestic front, it has launched a struggle against the capitalist-roaders in power led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and on the international front, it has launched a struggle against the imperialists and revisionists led by the United States and the Soviet revisionists. This unprecedented struggle has inspired the peoples of the world to dare to rebel, dare to win, dare to rebel against the imperialists and reactionaries led by the United States, and dare to rebel against the modern revisionists led by the Brezhnev-Kosygin group.

On May 23, 1967, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, in its statement, pointed out with great joy and pride: "The great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are the most significant international events of great historical significance. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, eliminating the modern revisionists who take the capitalist road within the Chinese Communist Party, state organs, and cultural organizations, and consolidating socialist China, becoming a reliable and powerful bastion of the world revolution."

China is a powerful and reliable bastion of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology for the proletariat and oppressed peoples to struggle for liberation. This is an irrefutable historical reality.

It is precisely because Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the revolutionary peoples of the world, because Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology and invincible weapon for the proletariat and all oppressed peoples worldwide to struggle for liberation, build socialism, and communism, because the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the international communist movement and the world revolution, and because China is the powerful and reliable center and base of the world revolution, that the attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Communist Party of China has become the measure of every revolutionary and every revolutionary party. Every revolutionary and every truly revolutionary party cannot but sincerely and firmly acknowledge that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, acknowledge that Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the proletariat of our time, the greatest and most brilliant genius of our time, acknowledge that the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the international communist movement and the world revolution, and acknowledge that China is the center and base of the world revolution, because these are objective historical realities.

The imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries have seen this historical reality and are therefore using every means and all forces to oppose Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and China. However, their attempts are in vain. They are like fools who pick up a stone to hit their own feet. As stated in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "This counter-revolutionary holy alliance is doomed to failure and is now in a state of disintegration."

The magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the victory drums for the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese people, and the victory drums for all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples worldwide. The victorious sound of Mao Zedong Thought resonates in all directions. All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples worldwide are now unanimously acclaiming the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with an irresistible giant's voice, issues a call: "Rebellion is justified." This call has frightened all reactionaries worldwide. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has also sounded the death knell for the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made the future of the world revolution more brilliant and glorious. China remains red. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high in the sky over the base of the world revolution—China—and is also planted by all revolutionary peoples worldwide on their own lands. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the world proletarian revolution will march towards final victory with determined steps. This is the general trend of the contemporary situation and the development of the world.

The statement of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on May 23, 1967, pointed out: "In the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which are the sources of imperialism's survival, the fact that the national liberation revolution is attacking the imperialist fortresses indicates that imperialism is inevitably heading towards comprehensive collapse. The revolutionary peoples of many countries are taking up arms to wage people's war, which is the only path to liberation. As the ringleader of all imperialists, reactionaries, and dark forces worldwide, American imperialism has suffered continuous heavy blows, weakening its strength. The brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people in their people's war against American imperialist aggression to defend their homeland clearly show that American imperialism is facing collapse." The statement also pointed out: "Now, the evil face of the Soviet modern revisionist group, playing the role of a counter-revolutionary, is increasingly exposed to all revolutionary peoples worldwide. The fate of comprehensive collapse that imperialism is about to face will also befall its most loyal accomplice, the Soviet modern revisionist group."

In the struggle between the two lines, that is, the revolutionary line of Mao Zedong Thought and the revisionist or opportunist "peaceful road" peddled by the Soviet Khrushchev and the Chinese Khrushchev, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has also given the Indonesian revolutionary people profound education. After fierce struggles, the revolutionary line, that is, the people's war line of Mao Zedong Thought, has finally won. The "Self-Criticism" of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party is the first victory of Indonesian Marxist-Leninists. The statement of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on May 23, 1967, is another victory that follows. These two documents clearly show that after correcting the serious errors of revisionism or opportunism in the past, the Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party will definitely be able to lead the brave Indonesian people onto the revolutionary path taught by Chairman Mao. The statement of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on May 23, 1967, pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party, with firm resolve and doubled confidence, bravely raises high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, advances courageously, and will definitely overthrow the fascist regime led by Suharto and achieve final victory. Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, which holds high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Marxism-Leninism, the Indonesian people, who have already started armed struggle, will launch a great people's war and bury the Indonesian reactionaries led by Suharto-Nasution.

The magnificent achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao have made China more consolidated and powerful. The future of the world revolution is more brilliant and glorious. The future of the Indonesian revolution is the same.

Let us resolve to raise high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and continue to advance on the revolutionary path!

　　世界革命人民的伟大胜利
　　印度尼西亚　伊布拉欣·伊萨
　　（一）
    一年以前，当中国无产阶级文化大革命开始的时候，确实有许多同志，包括我自己在内，对毛泽东主席亲自发动和亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史意义，缺少正确而深刻的理解。当时我们没有认识到，中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅关系到中华人民共和国的前途和命运，而且关系到全世界无产阶级革命和全世界被压迫被剥削的人民解放的命运。当时我们没有深刻地认识到无产阶级文化大革命是两个阶级、两条路线——无产阶级和资产阶级之间的你死我活的严重的阶级斗争。
    我们学习了中国共产党八届十一中全会的文件，学习了林彪同志和周恩来同志在去年八月十八日庆祝无产阶级文化大革命群众大会上的讲话，读了《人民日报》、《解放军报》、《红旗》等报刊发表的关于无产阶级文化大革命的重要文章，又亲自和中国红卫兵及其他革命群众交换了意见，而最最重要的是亲身参加了无产阶级文化大革命的各种会议，经过这些以后，我们对无产阶级文化大革命的重大历史意义才有了比较深刻的理解。我们这才渐渐认识到在中国进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命是全世界人民和全世界无产阶级革命的特大喜事。
    无产阶级文化大革命拯救了全世界无产阶级的革命和全世界人民的革命，使其免于被以苏共领导集团为首的修正主义者所叛卖。这就是中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义。为什么说无产阶级文化大革命拯救了全世界人民的革命呢？为什么说无产阶级文化大革命是全世界人民的大喜事呢？
    理由很多。但最主要的有以下几点：1、当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想传播到全世界，并开始为全世界人民所掌握；2、以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部被摧毁了，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派日夜盼望的中国复辟资本主义的美梦破产了；3、中国——世界革命的基地，将永远保持着鲜红的颜色，而且愈加巩固；4、世界革命的前途越发光辉灿烂。我认为，说中国无产阶级文化大革命是全世界人民的大喜事，其理由就在于此。说这场无产阶级文化大革命不只是七亿中国人民的事，而且也是世界人民的事，其理由就在于此。同样，全世界革命人民满腔热情地欢迎和支持无产阶级文化大革命，热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的一个又一个的伟大胜利，其理由也在于此。
　　（二）
      在无产阶级文化大革命以前，中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙竭力阻止在七亿中国人民和全世界人民中间传播和宣传毛泽东思想。这是对世界人民犯下的不可饶恕的罪行。无产阶级文化大革命开展后，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的中国共产党内最大一小撮走资本主义道路当权派设置的障碍被排除了，于是传播、宣传、学习和运用毛泽东思想的运动蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界其他各地的革命人民正普遍学习和运用进行斗争的最锐利武器——毛泽东思想，决心走中国的道路，人民战争的道路，争取解放的唯一道路，这已成为任何力量无法阻挡的历史潮流。这是无产阶级文化大革命的第一个伟大的胜利，同时也是全世界人民的伟大的胜利。
    毛主席教导的正确性已经为中国革命和世界人民革命的实践所证明。为世界人民革命和斗争的成功经验和失败教训所证明。毛主席在理论上和实践中领导了全世界马克思列宁主义者。毛主席亲自发动和领导了中国无产阶级文化大革命。这一切都证明毛主席是当代最杰出的无产阶级领袖，是当代最伟大和最英明的天才。
    毫无疑问，正是因为有毛主席的领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指导，所以在中国才有可能开展这场防止资本主义复辟，挖掉修正主义根子和巩固无产阶级专政的无产阶级文化大革命。没有毛主席的领导，没有为中国人民所掌握的最锐利的武器——毛泽东思想，没有由毛主席领导的用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，便不可能进行无产阶级文化大革命。不可能设想没有毛主席和毛泽东思想而能有无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席最亲密的战友林彪同志说：“要搞好这场文化大革命，靠什么呢？靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠群众的智慧和力量！”
    从另一方面说来，无产阶级文化大革命本身就是一个空前的伟大运动，在运动中数亿群众学习和运用毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想作为斗争的武器和每一个行动的指导方针，它是牢固地树立毛泽东思想的伟大事业。在国际共产主义运动中，无产阶级文化大革命是使数亿人民掌握毛泽东思想的史无前例的伟大运动，它使毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，从而变成巨大的物质力量，这个力量能打破旧的东西，砸烂腐朽反动的东西，打倒走资本主义道路的当权派，树立无产阶级思想。这个伟大运动的本身就是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命不仅仅是在七亿中国人民中传播毛泽东思想，同时也是向全世界革命人民传播和宣传毛泽东思想。全世界人民通过自己斗争的实践认识到并且确信：毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。
    印尼共中央政治局在一九六七年五月二十三日的声明中对无产阶级文化大革命明确表示并正确指出：
  “印度尼西亚革命人民和全世界革命人民共同热烈欢呼毛泽东思想和中国人民的伟大胜利。毛泽东思想解决了一系列的社会主义社会阶级斗争的理论和实践问题，保证了无产阶级专政和社会主义制度的巩固，防止资本主义的复辟。这样，毛泽东思想就把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段。成为当代马克思列宁主义顶峰的毛泽东思想，向全世界革命人民指明了获得解放和达到社会主义的道路。毛泽东思想是鼓舞被压迫人民进行斗争的永不枯竭的源泉，是全世界马克思列宁主义者反对现代修正主义的大规模的斗争中的伟大指针。印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者毫不犹豫地承认毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，下定决心学习和运用毛泽东思想，把它作为争取印度尼西亚解放的锐利武器，毛泽东同志所指出的人民战争的道路是印度尼西亚解放斗争不可避免的必经之道。”
    印尼共中央政治局的声明完全反映了在马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，正在为推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权而进行长期武装斗争的印度尼西亚人民的感情和愿望。印尼共中央政治局的声明进一步表明：在马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党的领导下的印度尼西亚人民的结论和一致的决心是，要取得革命的胜利，必须高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，这是印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者和印度尼西亚人民的伟大胜利。从特殊意义说来，通过印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者的激烈斗争，而取得的毛泽东思想在印度尼西亚共产党内的胜利也是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，也是无产阶级文化大革命对印度尼西亚人民的伟大贡献。
　　（三）
    中国广大的革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中揭露，并最后摧毁了隐藏在中国党和国家机关内的叛徒和老反革命——中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，这是一个伟大的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是全世界革命人民的胜利。它是对国际共产主义运动和世界人民革命又一重大的贡献。
      中国赫鲁晓夫这个隐蔽的资产阶级司令部的总头头，一贯反对由毛主席领导的无产阶级司令部，是中国人民和中国无产阶级专政最危险的敌人。他和他的同伙，正如毛主席说的那样，“例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁”。象毛主席指出的那样，如果中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的同伙，没有被揭发出来，没有斗倒、斗臭，“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”我们由此便可以意识到，无产阶级文化大革命是何等的重要，它的主要任务是何等的重大。为了完成防止资本主义复辟和根除修正主义，就必须彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。
    由毛主席和中共中央规定的这个任务，以及由在毛泽东主席领导下的无产阶级司令部发动的这场激烈和复杂的斗争，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政理论的最伟大的创造性的贡献，是对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政理论的创造性的发展。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部所进行的阴谋活动，不仅是对中国无产阶级和中国人民犯下滔天罪行，实质上也是对世界各国人民的革命事业和革命斗争犯下了莫大的罪行。由中国赫鲁晓夫领导的资产阶级司令部，反对由毛主席领导的无产阶级司令部，反对毛泽东思想，实质上就是反对革命，反对真理，反对全人类的解放事业。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个资产阶级司令部的总头头，不仅要在中国复辟资本主义，要做一个“红色”买办，积极进行活动，而且要扑灭世界各国人民的革命烈火。他和他的资产阶级司令部散布各种已经破了产的走向社会主义的“和平”道路的谬论，散布各种叛徒理论，污蔑武装斗争。他还散布各种和反动派进行合作、向帝国主义和它的仆从投降的叛徒理论。他要缅甸人民放下武器，向缅甸反动派投降。
    当中国的赫鲁晓夫于一九六三年四月访问印度尼西亚时，他拚命吹捧印尼共通过“纳沙贡”道路表现出来的阶级合作政策和尾随资产阶级的政策。他甚至表示，印尼共产党“在政府里有更多的人当部长有好处，可以多积累一些管理国家的经验”。他还颂扬马来亚、菲律宾和印度尼西亚反动派当时正在拼凑的三国反动联盟。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏联的赫鲁晓夫本质上是一丘之貉，但是在实际行动中中国的赫鲁晓夫更加危险，因为他长期地打着“红旗”反红旗。他以狡猾的手段反对毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”、“枪杆子里面出政权”、“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”、“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃……”等等英明论断。他到处极力推销他的叛徒哲学。
    伟大的中国人民和世界各国革命人民用毛泽东思想作为最锐利的武器，揭露和批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，谴责和反对他的修正主义货色。这是无产阶级文化大革命的另一个胜利。中国赫鲁晓夫的被彻底揭露，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派妄图在中国复辟资本主义的美梦彻底破产了。
　　（四）
    自从赫鲁晓夫篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导权之后，对外投降美帝，对内复辟资本主义，背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了无产阶级国际主义，背叛了国际无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族的革命事业，背叛了伟大的苏联人民和世界革命人民的利益。
    苏联过去在列宁、斯大林领导时期是世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家，是无产阶级和全世界被压迫人民的希望和信赖的力量，如今苏修领导集团改变了苏联的颜色，把无产阶级专政的苏联变成了资产阶级专政。莫斯科的苏修领导集团是华盛顿以外的一个反革命中心。那些追随苏联现代修正主义的国家，改变了社会主义的颜色，堕落成为资本主义复辟的国家。若干共产党，例如法国、意大利、印度、美国等的共产党沦为赫鲁晓夫的仆从，堕落成为修正主义的党。
    在这种情况下，伟大的中国共产党在毛主席领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，革命的旗帜，反对帝国主义及其走狗的战斗旗帜，站在斗争的前列，领导马克思列宁主义者和世界人民反对以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义者的背叛行为。毛主席在世界共产主义运动中作出的创造性的贡献是无法估量的。在上述情况下，如果没有毛泽东主席，如果没有伟大的毛泽东思想和强大的中华人民共和国，世界会变成怎样，世界革命的命运会变成怎样，是难以想象的。
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，加强了马克思
  列宁主义者对现代修正主义者的猛烈反击。无产阶级文化大革命再一次表明了中国是世界革命的中心和基地。无产阶级文化大革命在两条战线向反动派和现代修正主义者展开了具有伟大历史意义的大规模的斗争，即在国内战线展开了对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的走资本主义道路的当权派的斗争，在国际战线展开了对以美帝和苏修为首的帝国主义、修正主义者的斗争。这个史无前例的斗争鼓舞了世界人民敢于造反、敢于胜利。敢于造以美帝为首的帝国主义和反动派的反，敢于造以勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团为首的修正主义者的反。
    一九六七年五月二十三日印尼共中央政治局在它的声明中极其高兴和骄傲地指出：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就是具有伟大历史意义的国际上最重大的事件。在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中已经取得了光辉的胜利，清除了中国共产党内、国家机构中和文化团体内走资本主义道路的现代修正主义者，巩固了社会主义的中国、成为世界革命强大的最可信赖的堡垒。”
    中国是世界革命强大的和最可信赖的堡垒。毛泽东思想是无产阶级和被压迫人民争取解放的指导思想。这是无可辩驳的历史现实。
    正是由于毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅和伟大舵手，正是由于毛泽东思想是无产阶级和全世界被压迫人民争取解放，建设社会主义和共产主义的指导思想和战无不胜的武器，正是由于中国共产党是国际共产主义运动和世界革命的先锋队，正是由于中国是世界革命的强大的最可信赖的堡垒和中心，因此对毛主席、毛泽东思想和中国共产党采取什么态度，就成为衡量每一个革命者和每一个革命政党的尺度。每一个革命者和每一个真正革命的政党，不能不诚心诚意的，十分信服的承认毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，承认毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，当代最伟大和最英明的天才，承认中国共产党是国际共产主义运动和世界革命的先锋，承认中国是世界革命的中心和基地，因为这些都是历史的客观现实。
    以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派看见了这个历史现实，于是就千方百计地、动员一切力量来反对毛主席、毛泽东思想和中国。但是他们的企图是徒然的，他们象蠢人一样，搬起石头砸自己的脚。正象中国共产党八届十一中全会公报中所说的：“这种反革命的神圣同盟，是注定要破产的，现在已经陷于分崩离析。”

    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命擂响了中国无产阶级和中国人民的胜利战鼓，擂响了全世界马克思列宁主义者和全世界革命人民的胜利战鼓。毛泽东思想胜利的鼓声响彻四面八方，全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民现在同声欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命以不可阻挡的巨人般的声音发出召唤：“造反有理”这个召唤吓得全世界反动派胆战心惊。无产阶级文化大革命同时也为以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派敲响了丧钟。
    无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大成就，使世界革命的前途越来越灿烂辉煌，中国保持着鲜红的颜色。毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高高地飘扬在世界革命的根据地——中国的上空，也被全世界革命人民插在各自的国土上。在毛主席的领导下，世界无产阶级革命将以坚定的步伐走向最后胜利。这就是当代形势和世界发展的总趋势。
    印尼共中央政治局一九六七年五月二十三日的声明指出：“在成为帝国主义生存的源泉的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国中，民族解放革命正在冲击着帝国主义堡垒这一事实，表明了帝国主义不可避免地正在走向全面崩溃。许多国家的革命人民正在拿起武器进行人民战争，这是走向解放的唯一道路。作为世界帝国主义与一切反动派和黑暗势力的总头目的美帝国主义，遭到了不断的沉重打击，使它的力量削弱了。越南人民为反抗美帝国主义侵略保卫祖国所进行的人民战争的光辉胜利清楚地表明，美帝国主义正面临着崩溃。”声明还指出：“现在，苏联现代修正主义集团扮演的反革命角色的罪恶嘴脸在全世界革命人民面前已经越来越暴露无遗。帝国主义即将全面崩溃的命运也必将落到它最忠实的帮凶苏联现代修正主义集团的头上。”
    在两条路线，即毛泽东思想的革命路线和苏联赫鲁晓夫同中国赫鲁晓夫所兜售的修正主义或机会主义的“和平道路”的路线之间的斗争方面，中国无产阶级文化大革命也给了印度尼西亚革命人民以深刻的教育。经过激烈的斗争，革命路线，也就是毛泽东思想的人民战争路线，终于获得了胜利。印尼共中央政治局的《自我批评》是印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者的第一个胜利，一九六七年五月二十三日印尼共中央政治局的声明是紧接着的又一个胜利，这两个文件清楚地表明，在纠正了过去修正主义或机会主义的严重错误之后，马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党一定能把英勇的印度尼西亚人民引导到毛主席所教导的革命道路上来。一九六七年五月二十三日印尼共中央政治局的声明指出，印尼共以坚定的决心和百倍的信心勇敢地高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奋勇向前，一定能打倒以苏哈托为首的法西斯政权，获得最后胜利。在马列主义的、高举毛泽东思想红旗的印尼共的领导之下，已经开始进行武装斗争的印度尼西亚人民必将发动一场伟大的人民战争，埋葬以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动派。
    在毛主席领导下的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌成就，使中国愈加巩固和强大。世界革命的前途越来越光辉灿烂。印度尼西亚革命的前途也同样如此。
    让我们下定决心，高高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的旗帜，在革命道路上继续前进！
