The Johnson administration has recently been loudly proclaiming the need to establish an "anti-ballistic missile system," fervently inciting anti-China sentiment. On September 18, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara announced that the United States had decided to begin construction of an "anti-ballistic missile system" aimed at China by the end of the year. Following this, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Goldberg also called for the establishment of an "anti-ballistic missile system" to counter the threat of missile attacks from mainland China at the United Nations General Assembly. The ruthless U.S. imperialists are truly terrified by China's possession of nuclear weapons and missiles!

The U.S. imperialists' decision to build an anti-missile system against China is the result of a conspiracy with the Soviet revisionist leadership. A French newspaper recently reported: "The establishment of a sparse anti-missile network by the United States is a tacit agreement reached during the Johnson-Kosygin Glassboro talks." Before announcing this decision, the Johnson administration had already informed the Soviet revisionist leadership. McNamara openly admitted that the United States does not need to "waste effort" on building an anti-missile system against the Soviet Union and advocated for an agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on nuclear attack and "nuclear defense" issues. This exposes the sinister plot of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to collaborate militarily against China.

The U.S. imperialists regard socialist China as their primary enemy. Their nuclear strategy is mainly directed against China, and the so-called "anti-ballistic missile system" they plan to build is also aimed at China. The fact that socialist China has mastered nuclear weapons is a tremendous inspiration to the revolutionary people of the world, but it is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries. The most vicious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, hates and opposes China so much, which is a great honor for the Chinese people.

The Soviet revisionist leadership often brandishes nuclear weapons, boasting that they will "protect" all humanity, and puts on a "savior" facade. However, people have seen that during the Caribbean crisis, Khrushchev's bluster was already exposed. Later, Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin openly made one dirty nuclear deal after another with U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism not only feels secure about the nuclear weapons in the hands of the Soviet revisionist clique but also conspires with it to deal with socialist China. This completely strips off the hypocritical mask of the Soviet revisionist clique, revealing the ugly face of traitors and accomplices. The facts fully prove that the nuclear weapons in the hands of the Soviet revisionist clique, like those in the hands of U.S. imperialism, are used to threaten the revolutionary people of the world and serve their counter-revolutionary and anti-people purposes.

Once upon a time, these two nuclear bullies, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, relied on their nuclear monopoly to strut around and engage in nuclear blackmail, attempting to intimidate the revolutionary people of the world and dominate the fate of the world. However, in a short time, their nuclear monopoly was broken, and their nuclear blackmail failed. Today, they are busy planning some "anti-ballistic missile system." For the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership, who once considered themselves nuclear bullies, isn't this a bitter irony?

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 21 years ago: "The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by the American reactionaries to scare people. It looks terrible but in fact, it is not so terrible." The revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people and the people of the world have exposed this paper tiger used by the American reactionaries to scare people, proving the great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao.

When the Chinese people did not have nuclear weapons, they never took the U.S. imperialists' nuclear blackmail seriously; and now that we have mastered nuclear weapons, we will never be deluded by their power. The Chinese government has repeatedly declared that China's development of nuclear weapons is purely for defense, and the ultimate goal is to eliminate nuclear weapons. China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists want to use China's nuclear weapons to incite anti-China sentiment, which is entirely in vain.

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb in the hands of the revolutionary people of all countries. Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the billions of revolutionary masses around the world, can produce an incredibly powerful material force. Mao Zedong Thought, deeply rooted in people's hearts, is an irresistible force for any power. No matter how many "anti-ballistic missile systems" the Johnson administration builds, it will never be able to stop the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought or the surging tide of world revolution. The revolutionary people of the world, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful spiritual atomic bomb, will surely be able to eliminate any demon and monster, shatter the dark old world, and create a bright new world!

　　美国“核霸王”可悲的挣扎
　　本报评论员
    约翰逊政府最近大肆叫嚷要建立一个什么“反弹道导弹系统”，竭力煽动反华。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在九月十八日的一次讲话中宣布，美国决定在今年年底着手建立“针对中国”的“反弹道导弹系统”。接着，美国驻联合国代表戈德堡又在联合国大会上叫喊要建立“对付大陆中国进行导弹攻击的威胁”的“反弹道导弹系统”。穷凶极恶的美帝国主义，对于中国拥有核武器和导弹，简直吓得不寒而栗！
    美帝国主义决定建立对付中国的反导弹系统，是同苏修领导集团密谋的结果。法国报纸不久前报道：“美国建立稀疏的反导弹网，是约翰逊和柯西金的葛拉斯堡罗会谈作出的默契”。约翰逊政府在宣布这个决定之前，就把情况先通知了苏修领导集团。麦克纳马拉公开承认，美国不需要为了建立对付苏联的反导弹系统而“浪费力量”，并且鼓吹美苏两国就核进攻和“核防御”问题达成协议。这就暴露了美帝、苏修加紧在军事上合伙反华的阴谋计划。
    美帝国主义把社会主义的中国当作它的主要敌人。它的核战略部署，主要是针对中国的，它准备建立的所谓“反弹道导弹系统”，也是针对中国的。社会主义的中国掌握了核武器，对于全世界革命人民是一个巨大的鼓舞，而对于美帝国主义和一切反动派，不能不是沉重的打击。全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，这样仇视和反对中国，正是中国人民莫大的光荣。
    苏修领导集团经常拿着核武器，吹嘘他们要“保护”全人类，装出一副“救世主”的面孔。可是，人们看到，在加勒比海的危机中，赫鲁晓夫的牛皮早已吹破了。以后，赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金索性公开地同美帝国主义做成了一笔又一笔肮脏的核交易。美帝国主义对于苏修集团手里的核武器，不仅很放心，而且还要同它合谋来对付社会主义的中国。这就赤裸裸地揭下了苏修集团的虚伪的面纱，露出了叛徒和帮凶者的狰狞嘴脸。事实完全证明，苏修集团手里的核武器，同美帝国主义手里的核武器一样，都是为了威胁全世界的革命人民的，都是为它们的反革命反人民的目的服务的。
    想当年，美帝苏修这两个核霸王，凭借着自己的核垄断地位，耀武扬威地到处进行核讹诈，妄想吓倒世界革命人民，主宰世界的命运。但是，曾几何时，它们的核垄断被打破了，他们的核讹诈破产了。今天，它们居然忙着张罗起什么“反弹道导弹系统”，这对于当年以核霸王自居的美帝国主义和苏修领导集团说来，难道不是一种辛辣的讽刺吗？
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早在二十一年前就指出：“原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实际上并不可怕。”中国人民和世界人民革命斗争的实践，戳穿了美国反动派用来吓人的这只纸老虎，证明了毛主席指出的这个伟大的真理。
    中国人民在没有核武器的时候，从来不把美帝国主义的核讹诈放在眼里；而在我们掌握了核武器以后，也决不迷信核武器的作用。中国政府多次声明，中国发展核武器，完全是为了防御，其最终目的是为了消灭核武器。中国在任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。美帝、苏修想要利用中国的核武器来煽动反华，完全是枉费心机的。
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是各国革命人民手中的最强大的精神原子弹。毛泽东思想同世界亿万革命群众相结合，就能够产生无比巨大的物质力量。毛泽东思想深入人心，是任何力量也无法阻挡的。不论约翰逊政府建立多少个“反弹道导弹系统”，也决然阻止不了伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，阻止不了世界人民革命的滚滚巨流。世界革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想这颗威力最强大的精神原子弹，就一定能够消灭任何妖魔鬼怪，打碎黑暗的旧世界，创造一个红彤彤的新世界！
