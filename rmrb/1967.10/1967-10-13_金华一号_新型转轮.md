The new type impeller named "Jinhua No. 1" has been successfully developed and put into production at the Jinhua Water Turbine Factory in Zhejiang Province. This new type impeller, when installed on the water wheel pumps widely used in rural areas, increases efficiency by 6% compared to the previously used 70-type impeller. Each water wheel pump can irrigate an additional 50 mu (approximately 3.3 hectares) of farmland. When installed on small water turbines, the power generation capacity is also significantly improved.

 　“金华一号”新型转轮
    被命名为“金华一号”的新型转轮，在浙江省金华水轮机厂试制成功，并正式投入生产。这种新型转轮装在目前农村大量采用的一种水轮泵上，效率比过去采用的七○型转轮提高百分之六，每台水轮泵可以多灌溉五十亩左右的农田。把这种新型转轮装在小型水轮机上，发电能力也显著提高。
