Mao Zedong Thought is the Beacon for Revolutionary Unity
—How Two Worker Revolutionary Organizations in Shanghai's Zhabei District Achieved Revolutionary Unity

Editor's Note: The experience of two worker revolutionary organizations in Shanghai's Zhabei District in achieving revolutionary unity is fundamentally rooted in using the great Mao Zedong Thought as a guiding light, actively learning and applying the "Three Articles," fiercely combating the "self" and firmly establishing the "public."

They held high the beacon of Mao Zedong Thought, seeing more clearly that the "self" is the root of all evils, an obstacle to achieving revolutionary unity, and a poisonous drug used by the Chinese Khrushchev to corrupt people's souls and attempt to restore capitalism.

They actively learned and applied the "Three Articles," deeply reflecting on their own souls, removing the mountain of "self," and adhering to the high standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. They sincerely conducted self-criticism, eliminated petty-bourgeois factionalism, and achieved revolutionary unity.

The experience of workers in Shanghai's Zhabei District in achieving revolutionary unity through self-criticism and public establishment is excellent. It is hoped that revolutionary mass organizations in all sectors will learn from them, treat the "Three Articles" as a motto, study them daily, use them daily, and be vigilant against the rise of "self" at all times. They should persistently carry out the struggle of "criticizing self and opposing revisionism."

"Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions."

Chairman Mao's latest directive greatly inspired and educated the working class of Shanghai. "Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do!" The working class of Shanghai took the lead, launching an unprecedented and rapid wave of revolutionary unity. In this wave, two worker revolutionary organizations in Zhabei District—the Zhabei District Command of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters (abbreviated as Workers' Headquarters) and the Zhabei District Branch of the Workers' Headquarters—stood at the forefront of the struggle. They followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, swept away the "self," eliminated factionalism, and on September 12, achieved revolutionary unity, forming a new fighting collective—the Zhabei Liaison Station of the Workers' Headquarters.

Their transition from "division" to "unity" was the result of a fierce struggle between proletarian thought and bourgeois, petty-bourgeois thought, and another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Correcting the Course, Following the Trend

The Zhabei District Command and the Zhabei District Branch were both revolutionary mass organizations that emerged from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line in November of last year. They were comrades-in-arms fighting side by side. However, as the status of the revolutionary masses changed, petty-bourgeois thought grew in some leaders, with the "self" taking the lead. They focused too much on their own "small hills," often quarreled over trivial issues, and started "internal wars." On August 11, the two organizations even engaged in armed conflict over some specific issues. Afterwards, one side was furious, with some advocating to gather forces for a counterattack; the other side was also preparing, intending to further "devour" the opponent.

At this critical moment, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao issued a new battle order. The broad masses of workers enthusiastically and resolutely responded to the call, urgently demanding revolutionary unity. In this new situation, the question was whether to follow the course set by Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, or continue the "internal war." This was a serious issue facing both organizations. The responsible comrades of the Zhabei District People's Armed Forces Department and the Workers' Headquarters, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "we must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thought in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution," timely talked to the responsible comrades of the two organizations. The comrades from the Armed Forces Department sincerely asked them: "Is it beneficial for two revolutionary mass organizations to fight an 'internal war'? Is the overall direction correct?" "You are all leaders of mass organizations. Where do you want to lead your troops? Do you want to be commanders seeking fame and profit, or revolutionary fighters loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment?" They also pointed out warmly: "The working class listens most to Chairman Mao's words and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We believe you will definitely handle the relationship between the two sides correctly!" The leaders of both sides were deeply moved by these earnest words from the comrades of the Armed Forces Department and repeatedly considered the issue. That night, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, realizing: "Fighting this 'internal war,' the overall direction is wrong. It harms ourselves and lets the enemy escape, only making the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai happy." They decided to immediately stop the "internal war," follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and be proletarian revolutionary fighters.

Holding Study Sessions on the "Three Articles," Reflecting and Comparing

The situation demanded their unity, and the call for revolutionary unity from the masses grew louder. Riding the favorable tide, the comrades from the Armed Forces Department and the Workers' Headquarters jointly convened the responsible comrades of both sides for a three-day study session on actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in early September, using the "Three Articles" as a weapon to fiercely combat the "self" within their souls.

Everyone first studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "We all come from the four corners of the country, united by a common revolutionary goal." They recalled how, in the old society, they suffered together under the exploitation and oppression of the capitalists, shared the same fate, and breathed the same air. Now, why were class brothers fighting an "internal war"? They recalled how, under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, they shared hardships and fought side by side. Now, why were comrades-in-arms seen as "enemies"? They also recalled how eager they were to hear the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao when they first rebelled. Initially, when they "came out," their only wish was to follow Chairman Mao in revolution! But now, Chairman Mao teaches us to be models of unity, why can't the two organizations unite? The more they recalled, the more restless they felt. They said: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. We have common hatred and a common enemy." Some comrades excitedly said: "In the past, we suffered under the reactionaries, the capitalists' fists, but now we direct our spears at class brothers, doing what hurts our friends and pleases our enemies. This is truly unacceptable."

Fiercely Combating the "Self," Launching a Campaign of Self-Criticism and Public Establishment

Through reflection and comparison, class feelings were greatly aroused, and the boundaries between enemies and friends, right and wrong, were clearly drawn. At this time, under the guidance of the comrades from the Armed Forces Department, everyone further discussed: Why couldn't we unite in the past?

The reason, the reason, the fundamental reason in thought, was that after seizing power, their status changed, the "self" increased, petty-bourgeois factionalism became heavier, and the burden grew larger. Ultimately, Mao Zedong Thought was lacking.

They used Chairman Mao's brilliant work, the "Three Articles," as a weapon, carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, laying out the manifestations of the "self," lamenting the harm of the "self," fiercely excavating the roots of the "self," and launching a campaign of self-criticism and public establishment. They compared themselves to Comrade Zhang Zedong's "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and Comrade Norman Bethune's selfless dedication, feeling that there was a gap of ten thousand miles. Where was the difference? It was the mountain of "self" in their minds. Everyone expressed their determination to learn the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, remove the mountain of "self," replace it with a "public," deeply root the "public" in their minds, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

They reviewed the past "internal wars," saying that from the perspective of small hills and small groups, they fought for hills, used power to pressure others, sought fame and profit; "I am the main one," "only I am revolutionary," "I am the 'old rebel,' you are the 'conservative,' I have a 'large organization, many people, strong strength,' you have the 'wrong overall direction'"; they only saw others' faults and minor issues, exaggerated them, and only saw their own advantages and achievements, boasting and never forgetting, all of which were manifestations of the "self."

They said, it was this "self" that caused constant friction and endless "internal wars," leading to a situation where one side existed without the other, and they were irreconcilable; it was this "self" that confused enemies and friends, blurred right and wrong, directing the spear at comrades; it was this "self" that, like a mountain, separated the two brother organizations. Some comrades checked themselves, saying: Fighting the "internal war" was fighting for small hills and the "self," it was a private war.

Everyone became more excited and their hearts heavier. They deeply felt that fighting the "internal war" only harmed the direction of the struggle, harmed class feelings, harmed the glorious tradition of the working class, harmed the organizational discipline of the proletariat, disrupted the deployment of "grasping revolution and promoting production," and weakened the fighting strength of the proletarian revolutionary faction. They deeply felt that "self" was a harmful element, the root of all evils, a bloodless soft knife, a white ant and a worm that destroyed revolutionary unity. "Self" was the poisonous drug used by the Chinese Khrushchev to corrupt people's souls and achieve the restoration of capitalism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution of thought to combat the "self" and establish the "public," a great revolution to transform worldviews.

The "Three Articles" are the treasure for overthrowing the "self." They are the spiritual atomic bomb for transforming thoughts. The more you study the "Three Articles," the newer, deeper, and more intimate they become. Everyone said they must use Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful weapon, to crush it into powder.

Calculating Revolutionary Benefits, Not Old Accounts of Trivial Matters

After fiercely combating the "self," everyone was strict with themselves and lenient with others, sincerely conducting self-criticism, and expressing that old accounts of trivial matters would not be settled. The comrades from the Armed Forces Department pointed out to them that there were two standpoints and two methods of accounting. Was it to stand on the standpoint of proletarian party spirit, prioritizing the people's and party's interests, and calculating revolutionary benefits? Or was it to stand on the standpoint of petty-bourgeois factionalism, calculating the interests of small groups? After discussion, they agreed that calculating old accounts from the standpoint of petty-bourgeois factionalism only increased factionalism.

However, standing on the standpoint of proletarian party spirit, they must clarify major issues and settle one major account, which was the account of the harmful consequences of the bourgeois reactionary line. They said: The bourgeois reactionary line divided us into two factions, and we must settle accounts with the Chinese Khrushchev. The more they calculated, the more hatred they felt towards the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai. They decided to sweep away petty-bourgeois factionalism, achieve revolutionary unity, and be revolutionary fighters of Mao Zedong Thought. In discussing the seating arrangement of the leadership of the joint Zhabei Liaison Station, the responsible comrades of the two organizations demanded more of themselves, fiercely eliminated factionalism, and combated the "self." They said: "We are seizing power for the proletariat, seizing power for the revolution, not for small groups." "After unity, we are one whole and should not distinguish between you and me." "The revolution needs me to go where it is needed and do what is needed." This way, the leadership issue was smoothly resolved.

Continuous Revolution, Achieving New Merits and New Labor

The comrades of the Zhabei Liaison Station deeply felt that the process of achieving revolutionary unity was a process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, a process of self-criticism and public establishment, a process of transforming worldviews. The revolutionary unity of the two major organizations did not mean the end of the struggle between the two thoughts. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for revolutionary unity, achieving revolutionary unity relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and consolidating and developing revolutionary unity even more relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Now, they treat the "Three Articles" as a motto, study them daily, use them daily, and are vigilant against the rise of the "self" at all times, persistently combating the "self."

To consolidate revolutionary unity, everyone also established a common principle: "Things beneficial to revolutionary unity should be emphasized and done; things not beneficial to revolutionary unity should not be mentioned or done at all."

The responsible comrades of the Liaison Station also realized that in the past, due to their factionalism and mutual "internal wars," many grassroots units were also split into opposing factions. Therefore, they proposed the slogan "thinking of the grassroots, running to the grassroots, and rooting in the grassroots," rushing to grassroots units, checking their own mistakes, and guiding everyone to sit down and actively learn and apply the "Three Articles," combat the "self," eliminate factionalism, and promote revolutionary unity in grassroots units.

The working class of this district realized that achieving revolutionary unity was only the first step of a long march, and more magnificent and arduous tasks of struggle lay ahead. The working class of this district decided to continue to advance, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, step by step follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and make new contributions in the great learning, great criticism, great unity, "three-in-one combination," and struggle-criticism-transformation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seizing the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　毛泽东思想是革命大联合的指路明灯
　　——上海闸北区两个工人革命组织是怎样实现革命大联合的？
　　齐卫东
    编者按：上海闸北区两个工人革命组织实现革命大联合的经验，最根本的一条，就是用伟大的毛泽东思想作为指路明灯，活学活用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。
    他们高高举起毛泽东思想这盏指路明灯，更加看清了“私”字是百病之源，是实现革命大联合的障碍，是中国赫鲁晓夫用以腐蚀人们灵魂、妄图达到资本主义复辟的剧毒剂。
    他们活学活用“老三篇”，狠触自己的灵魂，搬掉“私”字的大山，按照“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的高标准，各自认真地多做自我批评，消除小资产阶级派性，实现了革命的大联合。
    上海闸北区工人们通过破私立公实现革命大联合的经验，是很好的。希望各行各业的革命群众组织，都要象他们那样，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，天天学，天天用，随时随地地警惕“私”字抬头，坚持不懈地进行“斗私，批修”的斗争。
    “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”
    毛主席最近发出的这一最新指示，极大地鼓舞、教育了上海工人阶级。“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干！”上海工人阶级一马当先，掀起了规模空前、迅猛异常的革命大联合的高潮。在这个高潮中，上海闸北区两个工人革命组织——上海工人革命造反总司令部
  （简称工总司）闸北区司令部和工总司闸北区分部，站在斗争的最前列。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，活学活用毛主席著作，横扫“私”字，铲除山头，在九月十二日实现了革命的大联合，组成了新的战斗集体——工总司闸北联络站。
    他们由“分裂”到“联合”，是无产阶级思想同资产阶级、小资产阶级思想激烈斗争的结果，是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。
    拨正航向，紧跟形势
    闸北区司令部和闸北区分部，都是在去年十一月份从资产阶级反动路线迫害下“杀”出来的革命群众组织，是并肩作战的战友。但是，随着无产阶级革命派的地位的变化，小资产阶级的思想在少数头头身上有所滋长，“我”字当头，对自己的“小山头”看得多了，往往为了一些枝节问题，不能正确处理，就打起“内战”来了。就在八月十一日，为了一些具体问题，两个组织甚至发生了武斗。事后，一方憋着一肚子气，有的主张集结力量，准备还击；另一方也积极准备，想进一步把对方“吃掉”。
    正在这时，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出了新的战斗号令。广大工人群众热烈地、坚决地响应号召，迫切要求实现革命的联合。在这样的新形势下，是沿着毛主席指引的航向，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，还是继续打“内战”，这是摆在双方组织面前的一个严峻的问题。中国人民解放军闸北区人民武装部和工总司的负责同志，根据毛主席的“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的教导，及时找了两个组织的负责人谈心。武装部的同志诚恳地向他们提出：“两个革命群众组织打‘内战’，到底对谁有利？大方向对不对？”“你们都是群众组织的头头，要把队伍带到那里去？你们要做争名夺利的指挥者，还是做忠于毛主席的革命路线、紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的无产阶级革命派战士？”并亲切地指出：“工人阶级最听毛主席的话，最照毛主席的指示办事，相信你们一定会正确处理好双方的关系！”双方头头对武装部负责同志这些语重心长的话，感触很深，反复考虑这个问题。当天晚上，他们反复地学习了毛主席有关正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，认识到：“这样打‘内战’，大方向错了，打了自己，放跑了敌人，只会使中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人感到高兴。”他们决心立即停止“内战”，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，做无产阶级革命派战士。
    开“老三篇”讲用会，回忆对比
    斗争的形势要求他们联合起来，广大群众要求大联合的呼声也越来越高。趁大好形势的东风，武装部和工总司的负责同志一道把双方的负责人召集起来，在九月上旬进行了三天活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，以“老三篇”为武器，狠斗灵魂中的“私”字。
    大家首先学习了毛主席的教导：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”他们回忆了旧社会同受资本家的剥削和压迫，同命运，共呼吸，而现在为什么阶级兄弟打“内战”呢？回忆了在资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖下，患难与共，并肩战斗，而现在为什么把战友当作“对头”呢？也回忆了自己刚起来造反时，是多么渴望听到伟大领袖毛主席的声音啊！当初“杀”出来的时候，只有一个心愿：就是要紧跟毛主席干革命！但现在毛主席教育我们要做大联合的模范，我们两个组织为什么还联合不起来呢？大家越回忆，越坐立不安。他们说：“我们工人阶级内部决没有根本的利害冲突，有的是一致的仇和恨，有共同的目标、共同的敌人。”有的同志激动地说：“过去我们吃过反动派的苦头，资本家的拳头，现在我们却把矛头指向阶级兄弟，做了亲者痛、仇者快的事，真是太不应该了。”
    狠斗“私”字，开展破私立公斗争
    经过回忆对比，大大激发了阶级感情，划清了敌我界限和是非界限。这时，在武装部同志引导下，大家进一步议论：过去为什么联合不起来？
    这原因，那原因，思想上的一条根本原因，就是夺权以后，地位变了，“私”字多了，小资产阶级派性重了，包袱大了。归根到底，毛泽东思想少了。
    他们以毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”为武器，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，大摆“私”字的表现，痛诉“私”字的危害，狠挖“私”字的根源，开展了一场破私立公的斗争。他们用张思德同志“完全”
  “彻底”为人民服务和白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，对照自己，觉得真是相差十万八千里。差距在那里？就是脑子里有一座“私”字大山。大家表示一定要学习愚公移山的精神，挖掉这座“私”字山，换上一个“公”字，使“公”字在头脑里深深扎根，树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
      他们回顾过去打“内战”的情况说，从小山头、小团体的利益出发，争山头，以势压人，争名夺利；“以我为主”，“唯我独革”，我是“老造反”，你是“保”字号，我是“组织大，人数多，实力强”，你是“大方向错了”；对人家只看缺点和支流，而且抓住一点，无限上纲，对自己只见优点和成绩，而且居功自傲，念念不忘，凡此种种，都是“私”字的表现。
    他们说，正是这个“私”字，造成了磨擦不断，“内战”不休，以至有你无我，有我无你，势不两立；正是这个“私”字，颠倒了敌我，混淆了是非，把矛头指向战友；正是这个“私”字，象一座大山一样，把两个兄弟组织远远隔离。有的同志检查说：打“内战”，就是为小山头而战，为“私”字而战，打的是“私战”。
    大家越谈越激动，越谈心情越沉重。他们深深体会到，打“内战”，打来打去，打掉了斗争大方向，打掉了阶级感情，打掉了工人阶级的光荣传统，打掉了无产阶级的组织性、纪律性，打乱了“抓革命，促生产”的部署，打掉了无产阶级革命派的战斗力；打出了个人主义、山头主义、无政府主义，跟不上毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们深有体会地说，“私”是害群之马，“私”是百病之源，“私”是杀人不见血的软刀子，“私”是破坏革命大联合的白蚂蚁和蛀虫。“私”，就是中国赫鲁晓夫腐蚀人们灵魂、达到资本主义复辟的剧毒剂。
    无产阶级文化大革命就是一场破私立公的思想大革命，一场改造世界观的大革命。
　　“老三篇”是斗倒
    “私”字的法宝。是改造思想的精神原子弹。“老三篇”越学越新，越学越深，越学越亲。大家说，一定要用毛泽东思想这一威力强大的武器，把它压得粉身碎骨。
    算革命利益账，不算小是小非的旧账
    狠斗了“私”字，大家严于律己，宽于待人，认真进行自我批评，表示小是小非的老账一律不算。武装部同志向他们指出算账有两种立场，两种算法。是站在无产阶级党性的立场上，以人民的利益、党的利益为重，算革命利益账？还是站在小资产阶级派性的立场上，算小团体利益的账？经过讨论，认为站在小资产阶级派性立场上算老账，越算派性越重。
    但是，站在无产阶级党性的立场上，要弄清大是大非，有一笔大账一定要算，就是算资产阶级反动路线的恶果账。他们说：资产阶级反动路线把我们分成了两派，我们一定要和中国赫鲁晓夫算账。大家越算越引起了对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海代理人的仇恨。大家决心横扫小资产阶级的派性，实现革命的大联合，做毛泽东思想革命派。在讨论共同组织的闸北联络站的领导班子的席位问题时，两个组织的负责人更加严格要求自己，狠铲“山头”，痛斗“私”字。他们说：“我们是为无产阶级掌权，为革命掌权，不是为小团体掌权。”“联合后就是一个整体，应该不分你我。”“革命需要我到哪里就到哪里，需要我干什么就干什么。”这样，使领导班子问题顺利地得到了解决。
    不断革命，立新功建新劳
    闸北联络站的同志深深感到，实现革命大联合的过程，是活学活用毛主席著作的过程，是破私立公、改造世界观的过程。两大组织革命大联合的实现，并不意味着两种思想斗争的结束。毛泽东思想是革命大联合的指路明灯，实现革命大联合靠的是毛泽东思想，巩固和发展革命大联合更要靠毛泽东思想。现在，他们把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，天天学，天天用，随时随地警惕“私”字抬头，坚持不懈地与“私”字作斗争，在思想革命化的道路上迈进。
    为了巩固革命的大联合，大家还确定了一个共同遵守的原则：“有利于革命大联合的事，大讲特讲，大做特做；不利于革命大联合的事，一点不讲，一件不做。”
    联络站的负责人还认识到，过去由于自己闹山头主义，互相打“内战”，影响到不少基层单位也分裂为对立的两派。因此，他们提出了“心为基层想，腿往基层跑，根向基层扎”的口号，纷纷到基层单位，检查自己的错误，以自己的切身体会引导大家坐下来活学活用“老三篇”，斗“私”字，铲山头，促进基层单位实现了革命大联合。
    这个区的工人阶级认识到，实现革命的大联合，只是万里长征迈出了第一步，更加伟大、更加艰巨的战斗任务还在后头。这个区的工人阶级决心再接再厉，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命的大学习、大批判、大联合、“三结合”、斗批改中作出新贡献，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
