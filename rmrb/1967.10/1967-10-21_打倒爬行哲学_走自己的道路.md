	Overthrow the Philosophy of Crawling and Take Our Own Path
	Fang Xiuyuan, Technical Department, Qingdao Vehicle Factory

	Is our socialist construction going to follow the path of industrial development on our own, or are we going to crawl behind the foreigners? This is one of the focal points of the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev on the issue of socialist construction.

	In promoting the development of our socialist construction, the Chinese Khrushchev vehemently opposes Mao Zedong Thought, advocating the philosophy of crawling, claiming that "generally, to produce new products according to foreign designs, one must first imitate," and "all countries in the world 'rely on buying foreign patents' to rapidly improve their technological level." He even shamelessly says, "following the foreign path can help us avoid detours." In 1962, when our factory was trial-producing new products like handcarts and towed carts, the capitalist-roaders in power within the factory, guided by the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of crawling, completely copied a foreign set from product design to mass production. They set up numerous foreign frameworks, sent engineering and technical personnel to "guide" us, mobilized more than ten technical cadres, brought in a batch of process documents, spent over 50,000 yuan, and took half a year to finally succeed in the trial production. After the great proletarian cultural revolution began, our factory's revolutionary faction, based on the needs of the state and following Chairman Mao's teachings of "taking our own path of industrial development" and "relying on our own strength," displayed a daring spirit of thinking, speaking, and acting. They smashed the philosophy of crawling advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and, despite insufficient equipment and a lack of technical talent, overcame one difficulty after another. As a result, they succeeded in trial-producing a 2-ton three-wheeled motor vehicle in just half a year. Now, it has been officially put into production. The problem is clear: with the same amount of time and different methods, the results are vastly different.

	The philosophy of crawling advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev on the issue of socialist construction is a thoroughly reactionary bourgeois line. Its reactionary nature lies in pouring cold water on the Chinese people's enthusiasm for building socialism, attempting to strangle the great leader Chairman Mao's general line of "building socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and self-reliant spirit." It aims to make us kneel before the foreigners and crawl step by step behind them. However, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our country's socialist construction and scientific and technological development have achieved brilliant successes. We must thoroughly smash the philosophy of crawling advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and advance victoriously along the path of industrial development indicated by Chairman Mao.

    打倒爬行哲学　走自己的道路

    社会主义建设是走自己工业发展的道路，还是跟在洋人的屁股后面爬行呢？这是毛主席的革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线在社会主义建设问题上斗争的焦点之一。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在发展我国社会主义建设事业上，竭力反对毛泽东思想，推行爬行哲学，说什么“按照外国设计生产新产品，一般地要先仿制”，“世界各国都是‘靠买外国专利’来迅速提高技术水平的”，甚至无耻地说“照洋人路子走，可以少走弯路”。一九六二年我厂试制手推车和地排车新产品时，我厂党内走资本主义道路当权派，以中国赫鲁晓夫的爬行哲学为指导，从产品设计到成批投产全部照搬了外国的一套，规定了许多洋框框，派来了工程技术人员亲临“指导”，调动了十余名技术干部，搬来了成批的工艺文件，花了五万余元，用了半年的时间，才试制成功。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，我厂的革命派根据国家的需要，按照毛主席的“走自己工业发展的道路”、“放在自己力量的基点上”的教导，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，砸烂了中国赫鲁晓夫的爬行主义哲学，在设备不足，技术人才缺乏的情况下，克服了一个又一个的困难，结果仅用了半年的时间试制成功了载重两吨的三轮机动车，现在已正式投入生产。问题很清楚，用同样的时间，采用不同的方法，效果就大不相同。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在社会主义建设问题上推行的爬行主义哲学，是一条地地道道的资产阶级反动路线，它的反动性在于向中国人民建设社会主义的积极性大泼冷水，妄图扼杀我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，使我们拜倒于洋人的脚下，跟在洋人的屁股后面一步一步地爬行。但是，我国社会主义建设和科学技术的发展，在我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下取得了辉煌的成就。我们要彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫的爬行主义哲学，按照毛主席指出的工业发展道路胜利前进。
