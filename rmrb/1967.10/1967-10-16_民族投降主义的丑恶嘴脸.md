In April 1945, in his opening speech at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that after defeating Japan, the Chinese people faced two paths: "the path of light and the path of darkness." "Either an independent, free, democratic, unified, and strong China, that is, a new China of liberation for the Chinese people; or another China, a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, divided, and weak China, that is, an old China."

Which path will China take? Where will it go? Chairman Mao pointed out that we must strive to "build a new China that is bright, independent, free, democratic, unified, and strong."

At this critical moment when the fate of China and its two possible futures were being decided, China's Khrushchev put forward the fallacious theory of "red compradors" and national surrenderism.

China's Khrushchev shouted, "The Americans must find compradors in China, and we can go and be red compradors!"

What a "red comprador"!

A comprador is a comprador, and red is red; the two have nothing to do with each other. Compradors are all running dogs of imperialism, all traitors and sellouts. What is a "red comprador"? It is simply a euphemism for betraying the revolution.

"The Americans must find compradors in China." This statement is at least correct. Imperialist America wants to invade China and must find running dogs, spies, and traitors to be its tools for implementing its policy of aggression. On the crucial issue of China's future, China's Khrushchev peddled his fallacious theory of national surrenderism to meet the needs of imperialism. How evil his intentions are!

"We can go and be compradors." This reveals his long-held secret desire to be an American comprador.

As early as 1926, Chairman Mao, in his brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," provided a profound analysis of the comprador class. Chairman Mao said: "In economically backward semi-colonial China, the landlord class and the comprador class are completely appendages of international capitalism. Their existence and development are dependent on imperialism. These classes represent the most backward and reactionary production relations in China, obstructing the development of China's productive forces. They are completely incompatible with the goals of the Chinese revolution. In particular, the big landlord class and the big comprador class always stand on the side of imperialism and are extreme counter-revolutionaries."

The facts are exactly like this. In semi-colonial, semi-feudal old China, the landlord class and the comprador class were the two pillars of imperialist aggression. There were countless connections between the feudal landlord class and the comprador class. The comprador class was a class directly serving and raised by the capitalists of imperialist countries, often acting as intermediaries between feudal landlords and imperialists. The landlord class was the main social base for imperialist rule over China, and some feudal landlords were also compradors. They were extremely hostile to the revolution, so "in the history of the Chinese revolution, the big bourgeoisie with comprador characteristics has never been a driving force for the Chinese revolution but rather an object of the Chinese revolution."

From this, it is not difficult to see that the true intention behind China's Khrushchev's fallacious theory of "red compradors" is not only to restore the comprador system in China but also to restore the feudal system and imperialist rule over China. To surrender to imperialism, betray national interests, and make the Chinese people return to the old path of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism—that is the essence of the matter.

History tells us that all those who betray the interests of the people, all those who willingly become slaves of imperialism, are crushed into dust by the wheels of history and become a pile of filth unworthy of humanity! Li Hongzhang and Zeng Guofan were like this. Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei were like this. China's Khrushchev will be the same.

I ask, where does the plague lord want to go? Paper boats and candles illuminate the sky as they burn.

Let the national surrenderism of China's Khrushchev go to hell!

The Chinese people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and turn China into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

　　民族投降主义的丑恶嘴脸
　　尚港
    一九四五年四月，我们伟大领袖毛主席在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会的开幕词中指出，在打败日本之后，中国人民面前摆着两条道路，“光明的路和黑暗的路”，“或者是一个独立、自由、民主、统一、富强的中国，就是说，光明的中国，中国人民得到解放的新中国；或者是另一个中国，半殖民地半封建的、分裂的、贫弱的中国，就是说，一个老中国。”中国走什么路，向何处去？毛主席指出，要为“建设一个光明的新中国，建设一个独立的、自由的、民主的、统一的、富强的新中国而奋斗。”
    正当中国的两种命运、两个前途决定胜败的关键时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫抛出了“红色买办”的民族投降主义谬论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷什么：“美国非要在中国找买办不可，我们也可以给他去当买办，红色买办么！”
    好一个“红色买办”！
    买办就是买办，红色就是红色，两者之间毫不相干。买办都是帝国主义走狗，都是汉奸卖国贼。什么“红色买办”，完全是背叛革命的代名词。
    “美国非要在中国找买办不可”。这句话总算说对了。美帝国主义要侵略中国，一定要找走狗、坐探和内奸，做它推行侵略政策的工具。中国赫鲁晓夫在中国向何处去的重大问题上，大肆兜售他的民族投降主义谬论，以适应帝国主义的需要，用心何其毒也！
      “我们也可以给他去当买办”。一语道破了他早就想当美国买办的内心秘密。
    早在一九二六年，毛主席就在《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇光辉著作中，对买办阶级作了精辟的分析。毛主席说：“在经济落后的半殖民地的中国，地主阶级和买办阶级完全是国际资产阶级的附庸，其生存和发展，是附属于帝国主义的。这些阶级代表中国最落后的和最反动的生产关系，阻碍中国生产力的发展。他们和中国革命的目的完全不相容。特别是大地主阶级和大买办阶级，他们始终站在帝国主义一边，是极端的反革命派。”
    事实正是这样，在半殖民地半封建的旧中国，地主阶级和买办阶级是帝国主义进行侵略的两根支柱。封建的地主阶级和买办阶级之间存在着千丝万缕的联系。买办阶级是直接为帝国主义国家的资本家服务并为他们所豢养的阶级，它经常扮演着封建地主和帝国主义之间牵线人的角色。地主阶级是帝国主义统治中国的主要的社会基础，有些封建地主本身又兼买办。它们极端仇视革命，因此“在中国革命史上，带买办性的大资产阶级历来不是中国革命的动力，而是中国革命的对象。”
    从这里不难看出，中国赫鲁晓夫提出“红色买办”谬论的真正意图，不仅要在中国恢复买办制度，而且要恢复封建制度，恢复帝国主义对中国的统治。投降帝国主义，出卖民族利益，让中国人民重新回到半殖民地、半封建的老路，这就是问题的实质。
    历史告诉我们，一切出卖人民利益的人，一切甘当帝国主义奴才的人，都被历史的车轮碾得粉碎，成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆！李鸿章、曾国藩如此。蒋介石、汪精卫如此。中国赫鲁晓夫也如此。
    借问瘟君欲何往，纸船明烛照天烧。
    让中国赫鲁晓夫的民族投降主义见鬼去吧！
    中国人民将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
