Japanese friends attended the reception held by the Liaison Office of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Tokyo to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. They wished for the continuous development of the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.

	The Liaison Office of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Tokyo held a reception on the evening of September 30 to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Guests invited to the reception included Japanese revolutionary leftists who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and were engaged in the struggle against the revisionist clique of Kyonben, workers, peasants, friends engaged in Sino-Japanese friendship activities, and people from Japan's political, economic, and cultural circles, as well as representatives of patriotic overseas Chinese, totaling more than 1,200 people.

	During the reception, the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to toast the long life of the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and wished him long life.

	Wu Shudong, representative of the Liaison Office of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Tokyo, spoke at the reception, emphasizing the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Many Japanese friends enthusiastically praised the growing fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The Japanese friends said that the fact that so many people attended the reception to celebrate the National Day of China showed that the friends of the Chinese people are all over the world, which is a heavy blow to the combined anti-China efforts of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

	At the reception, Japanese friends sang songs in high spirits, praising Chairman Mao, as well as revolutionary songs from Japan. As the reception came to an end, Japanese friends and Chinese personnel in Japan linked arms and sang "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Tiller." As the singing stopped, people waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted with raised arms, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, ten thousand years!"

	The Chinese Commercial Representative Office in Chile held a reception on September 30 to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Salvador Allende, President of the Chilean Senate, Luis Parrado, First Vice President, and some deputy ministers of the Chilean government attended the reception. Also present were some members of various political parties, representatives from different sectors, and overseas Chinese residing in Chile, totaling more than 500 people.
