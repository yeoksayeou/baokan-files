The reactionary leaders of India, under the instructions of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, have recently visited Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the United Arab Republic, actively working to promote the U.S. and Soviet revisionist schemes of "bombing to force peace" and "bombing halt to entice peace" in Vietnam, and to persuade the Arab people to surrender to U.S. and Israeli aggression in the Middle East.

Indira Gandhi, the leader of the Indian reactionary government, left behind the mess at home and embarked on this overseas visit amidst the intense drumbeats of the "peace talks" offensive orchestrated by the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, along with other reactionaries, from the United Nations to the Vatican, from New Delhi to Belgrade. After U.S. imperialist leader Lyndon Johnson delivered his speech on September 29, outlining the plot to "bomb to force peace" and "bombing halt to entice peace" against the Vietnamese people, the Indian reactionary leaders, including Indira Gandhi, Desai, and Singh, began frantic diplomatic activities. Before Indira Gandhi's overseas visit, the Indian representative to the United Nations, Singh, delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly, lavishly praising Johnson's speech and advocating for the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing halt to entice peace" in Vietnam. Before visiting the Eastern European countries, Indira Gandhi also stopped in Moscow, meeting with Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin to coordinate her role in the "peace talks" farce orchestrated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

During her visit, Indira Gandhi held talks with the heads of state of Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the United Arab Republic, and issued joint statements. Throughout her journey, she danced to the tune of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, advocating for an "immediate and unconditional bombing halt" in Vietnam to lead to a "cessation of hostilities and the convening of the Geneva Conference," vigorously promoting the U.S. and Soviet revisionists' plot to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The Indian reactionary government, by acting as an accomplice in the U.S. and Soviet revisionists' plot to "cease fire" in the Middle East, has already gained a notorious reputation. During this overseas activity, Indira Gandhi, in collaboration with the Soviet revisionists and the Tito clique, once again persuaded the Arab people to surrender to the U.S. imperialists and their lackey, Israel. According to a reporter from the Egyptian newspaper *Al-Ahram*, Indira Gandhi, while feigning concern for a "fair solution to the (Middle East) problem," advocated for giving the United Nations "ample opportunity to handle the entire issue." This once again exposed the Indian reactionary government's ugly face of false support and true betrayal of the Arab people.

According to Indian newspapers, during this overseas activity, Indira Gandhi also conspired with the Soviet revisionist leaders and the Tito clique to engage in anti-China activities; the China issue "occupied an important position" in their talks.

However, the frantic efforts of the Indian reactionary leaders will neither save the U.S. imperialists, who are being beaten everywhere, nor help the Soviet revisionists, who are in deep crisis. They can only further expose their ugly faces as faithful servants of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

    妄图扑灭越南人民斗争　百般诱迫阿拉伯人民屈服
    印度反动头目四出奔走为美帝苏修效劳
    新华社二十四日讯  印度反动政府的头目英迪拉·甘地，在美帝和苏修的指使下，最近访问了波兰、南斯拉夫、保加利亚和阿联等国，积极为美帝苏修在越南策划“停炸诱和”，在中东诱迫阿拉伯人民向美、以侵略屈服的新骗局奔走效劳。
    英迪拉·甘地是在美帝和苏修勾结其他反动派，从联合国到梵蒂冈，从新德里到贝尔格莱德展开“和谈”攻势的紧锣密鼓声中，放下国内的破烂摊子，出国进行这次访问的。美帝国主义头子约翰逊九月二十九日发表了对越南人民玩弄“以炸迫和”“停炸诱和”阴谋的讲话之后，印度反动政府的头头英迪拉·甘地和德赛、辛格之流就四出进行紧张的外交活动。印度驻联合国代表辛格在英迪拉·甘地出国访问的前夕，在联合国大会发言大肆吹捧约翰逊的讲话，为美帝在越南的“停炸诱和”阴谋帮腔叫卖。英迪拉·甘地在访问东欧国家之前，还路经莫斯科，会见了苏修头目勃列日涅夫和柯西金进行勾搭，为她在美苏策划的“和谈”丑剧中扮演的角色请示机宜。
    英迪拉·甘地在访问期间，和波兰、南斯拉夫、保加利亚以及阿联等国政府首脑举行了会谈，并且发表了公报。她一路上到处按照美帝和苏修的曲调跳舞，鼓吹什么在越南“立即和无条件停炸”，以导致“停止敌对行动和召开日内瓦会议”等等，为美帝苏修扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争烈火的阴谋卖力。
    印度反动政府在阿拉伯人民抗击美、以侵略的斗争中，由于充当了美帝苏修策划的“停火”阴谋的帮凶，已经臭名远扬。英迪拉·甘地在这次外出活动中，又同苏修和铁托集团相配合，多方诱迫阿拉伯人民向美帝及其走狗以色列屈服。据阿联《金字塔报》记者报道，英迪拉·甘地一面假惺惺地叫喊“公平解决（中东）问题的迫切性”，一面又鼓吹“最好还是让联合国有充分的机会去处理整个问题”。这就又一次赤裸裸地暴露了印度反动政府对阿拉伯人民假支持、真出卖的丑恶嘴脸。
    据印度报纸透露，英迪拉·甘地在这次外出活动中，还同苏修头目和铁托集团之流策划反华勾当；在他们的会谈中，中国问题“占有重要地位”。
    但是，印度反动政府的头目们四出奔走，既救不了到处挨打的美帝的命，也帮不了危机四伏的苏修的忙，只能进一步暴露他们是美帝苏修忠实奴仆的丑恶嘴脸。
