Dear Comrade Kang Sheng:

Dear Comrade Wang Huayu:

Workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards of Shandong Province and Jinan City:

We, the representatives of the Albanian Communist Party and people, have come to your great country for a friendly visit. Today, the workers, Red Guards, and all revolutionary masses of Shandong Province and Jinan City have given us a grand, enthusiastic, and warm welcome, which deeply moves us. We sincerely thank you for this enthusiastic, fraternal welcome and regard it as a high expression of your deep friendship and affection for our Party, our people, and our country.

We are very happy to have the opportunity to visit the capital of Shandong Province, which has a population of 57 million, and this beautiful city of seventy-two springs, Jinan, which has bravely fought against Japanese militarism and the reactionary Kuomintang bandits. Nineteen years ago, the glorious People's Liberation Army led by Comrade Mao Zedong liberated this city. Today, we are very happy to meet with you—the steadfast warriors of the socialist revolution and loyal executors of Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist thought. Eight months ago, you adhered to the revolutionary line of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieved great unity, the three-in-one combination, overthrew a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, smashed them, and firmly grasped the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat in your own hands, establishing the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. This is the greatest victory since the victory of September 1948. This victory has had a tremendous impact on the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the whole socialist motherland.

The workers and peasants of Jinan City and Shandong Province, like all the people of China, have achieved great success in socialist construction and brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong in less than twenty years.

On this occasion, please allow me, on behalf of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, on behalf of the Albanian Communist Party members and all the Albanian people, and in the name of our leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, to extend warm, communist greetings to you—the revolutionary workers, Red Guards, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres of Jinan City, and all revolutionary masses of Shandong Province. We sincerely wish you a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and wish the great thought of Chairman Mao Zedong a thorough victory.

During our delegation's visit to China, two major events are taking place: the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China; the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sweeping across the entire country. These two revolutions are two major events in the life of the Chinese people, and they are two revolutions of world historical significance.

The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are, after the victory of the October Revolution in Russia, the greatest and most important turning point in the fate of the peoples of the world. This revolution ended the oppression and exploitation of feudalism and imperialism in China, put China on the path of socialist development, and dealt a fatal blow to the rear base of imperialism, causing a great change in the balance of power in the world in favor of socialism. The Chinese revolution has become a great example inspiring the revolutionary peoples of the world, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and a model of rich experience. Today, Asia, Africa, and Latin America have become the regions of contemporary revolutionary storms.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, is a continuation and development of the Chinese revolution, a new type of revolution, and an unprecedented revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This revolution is profound in content, far-reaching in purpose, correct in goal, and revolutionary in action. It is a fierce class struggle between two opposing lines, two opposing classes, and two opposing roads. The target of the revolution is a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This great revolution is to prevent revisionists, agents of the bourgeoisie, from seizing power, to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to advance the cause of the Chinese revolution and socialism. From this point of view, the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, the victory of revolution over counter-revolution, the victory of socialism over capitalism, and the victory of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his followers Peng Dehuai, Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, Tao Zhu, and others.

Therefore, it is entirely justified to say that the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the second great victory in the history of the Chinese people after the October Revolution of 1949. If the establishment of the People's Republic of China is a historic victory of the great people's revolution, opening the way for the socialist revolution and socialist construction in China, then the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution blocks the road to the destruction of revolutionary achievements and the restoration of capitalism in China.

The great historical achievements of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao are that they not only taught the Chinese working class and people how to overthrow the rule of landlords, capitalists, and imperialists, how to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, but they also summarized the experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat at home and abroad, especially the tragic experience of revisionism in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries where the revisionist clique has seized power. They led the 700 million revolutionary people of China to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, teaching them how to make revisionism "stop the car," how to prevent the restoration of capitalism, how to defend the fruits of socialist victory, and how to ensure that the people's China will never change color and will forever advance as a powerful shock brigade of international communism.

This revolution not only has a life-and-death significance for the fate of the Chinese people but also has a life-and-death significance for the communists and revolutionary peoples of all countries, for the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and for the world revolutionary cause. People's China is a great bulwark of socialism, a standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, and a strong revolutionary base for the peoples of the world. It is an insurmountable obstacle to the realization of the counter-revolutionary plans of the imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries. Everyone knows that if the Soviet revisionist tragedy is repeated in China, it will have how terrible consequences for the Chinese people and the peoples of the world. Therefore, the communists and revolutionary peoples of the world welcome the failure of the anti-communist, anti-China conspiracies of the agents of the bourgeoisie, imperialism, and Khrushchev revisionism in China, and they welcome the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are jubilant over its victory.

The Party of Labor of Albania, all its members, and all the Albanian people have forged an unbreakable revolutionary and fighting friendship with the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, regarding them as their closest, greatest, and most loyal friends, allies, and brothers. In the past and now, they have fully supported the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely condemned the bourgeois, revisionist counter-revolutionary line and activities of the Chinese Khrushchev and his followers, and fully supported the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line of the great leader of the Chinese people, the most respected and beloved friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong.

Our Party members and people closely follow the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. We regard every victory of this great revolution as our own revolutionary victory.

The main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres—have done tremendous work under the leadership of the Party. They have dealt a fatal blow to all the filth of the old world, the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes. They have exposed and struck at a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and are thoroughly smashing them. They have criticized and denounced the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" in the fields of science and literature. They have reformed and are reforming all the superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base. Thus, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only eliminates the current dangers threatening China but also eliminates any social base for the spread of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, thereby ensuring the permanent victory of socialism and the advance towards communism.

Imperialism, revisionism, the reactionaries of all countries, and the traitors of the working class are terrified by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They viciously attack the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, especially cursing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Comrade Mao Zedong. The Khrushchev revisionists led by Brezhnev and Kosygin have acted as black hands in this anti-China frenzy. This is a good thing that should make us happy. It shows that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has hit the enemy's vital points. Their frenzy indicates their panic and anxiety over the failure of their capitalist and revisionist conspiracies in China, showing that they fear the example of the Chinese revolution will inspire the revolutionary forces and peoples of all countries to rise up and overthrow their rule, showing that they are disoriented by the great revolutionary storm of the Chinese people, which demonstrates the invincible power of the Chinese people.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If the enemy opposes us, that is good; that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slandering us as worthless, that is even better; that means not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but it also proves that our work has been very successful."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is achieving historic victories. This once again clearly shows to the world that the Communist Party of China is a great Marxist-Leninist party, that the People's Republic of China is a great socialist country, an indestructible revolutionary fortress, that Comrade Mao Zedong is a great leader, a great Marxist-Leninist, and a great proletarian revolutionary, that no force can make China retreat, and that the conspiracies of the enemies of China at home and abroad are doomed to fail.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the broadest, deepest, and greatest revolutionary mass movement in history, truly embodying the broad democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It marks the unprecedented mobilization of the masses' lively initiative and creativity. It will enrich the theory and practice of the dictatorship of the proletariat with new and very valuable experience. In this movement, we see the broader and more resolute implementation of the mass line, the full trust in the masses, reliance on the masses, the mobilization of the masses, and the respect for the revolutionary initiative and creativity of the masses. This is precisely the great strength and indestructibility of the Communist Party of China and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is the guarantee for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to smash all obstacles and achieve its lofty goals.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out under the guidance of the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, and its victory is the victory of this thought. This thought has consistently pointed out the only correct path for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and led them from victory to victory. We are very satisfied and excited to see that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high tide and raised it to a new, higher stage. Today, the People's Republic of China has become a great school of Marxism-Leninism, where Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have become the daily spiritual food of hundreds of millions of people, educating and inspiring every action in their lives.

The 700 million people of China mastering the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong is a living great example and a brilliant proof of the principle of Marx that theory, once grasped by the masses, becomes an indestructible material force.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has revolutionized people's thinking, raised their political awareness and revolutionary spirit, and promoted and will continue to promote the rapid development of productive forces, the economy, people's culture, and science and technology. The country is implementing Chairman Mao's slogan of "grasp revolution, promote production," the principle of self-reliance and emphasizing proletarian politics, following the Party's general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical" socialist construction, and successfully carrying out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The examples of the workers of Daqing Oil Field, the production brigade of Dazhai, and the People's Liberation Army inspire the working class, laboring peasants, and all the people to carry out the revolution and build a new socialist China. The current "support the army and love the people" movement is another very important movement to learn from and fully support the People's Liberation Army because the People's Liberation Army is the army of the Chinese revolutionary people loyal to the revolutionary line of Mao Zedong, the main tool of the proletariat to suppress all enemies, a strong pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a reliable guarantee of the historic victories of the Chinese people.

Great China is advancing on the socialist road, becoming a country with immense economic and military power, increasing international prestige and influence. The level of China's science and technology and industry is most concentrated in nuclear tests, nuclear weapons containing thermonuclear materials, and the recent first hydrogen bomb test. The nuclear weapons and missiles in the hands of the people of China are another great victory for the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world, a great encouragement to further strengthen the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and the struggle for national liberation and social liberation. It is another heavy blow to the enemies of the peoples of the world. The imperialist and revisionist nuclear monopoly and thermonuclear monopoly used as tools of blackmail and aggression have failed. Their conspiracy to "prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons" has failed. Their plan to "contain" China has been shattered.

We are genuinely happy with the achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in socialist construction, and in strengthening national defense, and we wish you new and greater victories on all fronts.

Dear comrades:

The People's Republic of Albania, under the leadership of the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, stands as an invincible, revolutionary, socialist, and Marxist-Leninist fortress on the Adriatic coast, in the heart of capitalist and revisionist Europe, surrounded by countless enemies. Albania is successfully completing its domestic and foreign revolutionary tasks, advancing with a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other.

Nearly a year has passed since the convening of the Fifth Congress of our Party. This congress once again demonstrated the strength and consolidation of our Party, state power, economy, and our social and state system, and the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist line followed by our Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha. It demonstrated that the hostile actions of the modern revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union and others attacking our Party and people have failed. The congress showed that small Albania is invincible, that Albania has not only withstood all the attacks, conspiracies, and tricks of the imperialist and revisionist enemies but has also achieved great successes in socialist construction on all fronts and is advancing forever.

After our liberation, our Party and people have experienced the most difficult moments when Khrushchev "predicted" that Albania would be forced to surrender to him. We received the fraternal, completely internationalist aid and support of the glorious Communist Party of China and the great Chinese people. When the People's Republic of China had to overcome the difficulties caused by serious natural disasters and the blockade by Khrushchev revisionism and American imperialism, the selfless aid given by the People's Republic of China was a sublime expression of the great unity and friendship between our two parties, two countries, and two peoples. Dear comrades, please allow me, on behalf of the Party, government, and all the Albanian people, to express our heartfelt thanks to your great Communist Party, your government, your heroic people, and Chairman Mao for what you have done and are doing for our people and our country.

The Fifth Congress of our Party will be recorded in the history of our Party and people as the congress that formulated the program of labor and struggle for the further revolutionization of the entire life of the country, the Party, state power, production, education, culture, and people's thinking. Recently, in this regard, our Party has taken a series of measures and important resolutions, which are written in many Party documents.

In our country, a great revolutionary movement is sweeping all the working people, from the Young Pioneers to the elderly. What is the main content of this revolutionary movement? Its main purpose is to eradicate all the bases for the production and spread of revisionism, to block the road to the restoration of capitalism, to ensure the continuous development of the revolution, to defend the victories achieved, and to advance the socialist and communist cause of Albania.

In this regard, we proceed from the Marxist-Leninist principle that after the exploitation class is eliminated as a class, class struggle continues, and it remains the main driving force of the entire period of transition from capitalism to communism. As long as this class struggle continues at home and abroad, the victory of socialism is not guaranteed, and there is a continuous danger of the restoration of capitalism. This restoration not only comes from the outside, from the armed aggression of imperialism, but mainly from the inside, from the bourgeois-revisionist corruption.

At the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, Comrade Hoxha said: "Any abandonment of class struggle will have fatal consequences for the fate of socialism. Therefore, while fighting to increase production and develop culture and education, while fighting against foreign enemies—imperialists and revisionists—we must not abandon and forget the class struggle at home. Otherwise, history will punish us."

Our Party has consistently and correctly waged class struggle on the external front and on the internal front. Our Party has waged a resolute struggle against all class enemies, against all enemies inside and outside the Party.

Our Party has always been aware that class enemies want to crush the people first by overthrowing the Party; therefore, these enemies have always collaborated internally and externally against our Party. Our Party, to defend its correct line, Marxist-Leninist principles, and the purity of its ranks, and to prevent any infiltration by external anti-Party hostile elements, has waged a long revolutionary struggle. Our Party does not allow the existence of opposing lines within the Party, the existence of various factions that would endanger the Party and the people, and would undermine the unity of thought and action of the Party. Our Party has patiently used the methods of explanation and persuasion with all those who later took up anti-Party and anti-socialist positions, but when they were incorrigible and continued on the path of betrayal, our Party took the necessary measures against them without hesitation.

The Party is the heart and center of the people, the leading force of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Continuously strengthening the Party, defending the purity of its ranks, strengthening the ties with the masses, consistently applying the Marxist-Leninist principles of Party life, raising the leading role of the Party in all aspects of socialist construction, improving the methods and style of Party work—all these are the main aspects of our work to further revolutionize the Party.

Our Party and people are fighting against bureaucracy and its propagators to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The lesson of the Soviet revisionist tragedy clearly shows that without a resolute struggle against bureaucracy and bureaucrats, the enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is impossible to avoid the degeneration of socialism into capitalism. The struggle against bureaucracy and bureaucrats is one of the most important aspects of the class struggle in socialist society. This is a long and complex struggle. As long as class struggle continues, as long as the proletarian state itself exists, class struggle will continue.

The essence of this struggle is related to the establishment of correct relations between cadres and the masses, between office workers and laborers, and its purpose is to prevent the establishment of a privileged, bureaucratic stratum, to prevent the servants of the people from becoming the rulers of the people, otherwise, they would open the way for them to seize power and restore capitalism.

Our Party has consistently followed a correct line on this fundamental issue. The fact is that what happened here did not happen in the Soviet Union and other European socialist countries where the revisionist clique is in power. This clearly shows that in Albania, revisionism finds no social base for its counter-revolutionary activities. However, we have seriously considered this issue, and recently, our country has taken a series of measures of great political and ideological significance, such as: reducing high wages twice without affecting low and medium wages, establishing more reasonable proportions; cadres, administrative personnel, all intellectuals, youth students widely and generally working together with workers and peasants, directly participating in productive labor; planned and regular rotation of cadres between the center and the base; cadres, Communist Party members, and all government employees accepting strict supervision by the people; raising the role, powers, and authority of the people's elected government bodies and personnel; strictly implementing democratic centralism, opposing any manifestations of bureaucratic centralism; improving work methods and style, directing the main attention of government bodies to the living work of people, to the implementation of decisions and tasks, to not using "purely technical views" and "economism" to view all state and economic problems, but always emphasizing politics, constantly highlighting politics.

Based on its own conditions, Albania is successfully carrying out a thought and cultural revolution, which is the main front of the class struggle in our country today, a sharp, long, and historically significant struggle. Our Party's Fifth Congress pointed out, "As long as the socialist revolution in the field of thought and culture does not achieve complete victory, the victory of the socialist revolution in the political and economic fields is not guaranteed. Therefore, the struggle to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois and revisionist ideas in the field of thought is, in the final analysis, a matter of building socialism and communism, preventing the restoration of capitalism, or opening the door wide to the spread of bourgeois and revisionist ideas and returning to capitalism."

People are the decisive factor in revolution, construction, struggle, and work. Whether in revolution or counter-revolution, people's work must be done, so the method of educating people and the ideological concepts guiding people are the starting point of all human actions. Revisionism is not something else; it is the product of the political, ideological, and spiritual degeneration of the bourgeoisie. The struggle against bourgeois and revisionist ideas, the struggle against all manifestations of the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes, is the struggle against the resistance of class enemies in the field of ideology. This resistance is deeper and stronger than political and military resistance. Only when we defeat this resistance, as Lenin said, then we will nail the last nail on the coffin of the capitalist society we are burying.

"Think, work, and live like a revolutionary" is the slogan of all our Party's ideological work to educate laborers. Youth, the working class, cooperative farmers, and people's intellectuals are implementing this great revolutionary slogan, launching a total attack on the manifestations of bourgeois and revisionist ideological consciousness, feudal patriarchal backward customs, religious superstitions and prejudices, bureaucracy, and everything contrary to our socialist system and ideological consciousness. The flames of this revolutionary struggle are burning away all the weeds left by the old exploiting classes and old exploiting system, this revolutionary struggle is sweeping away the reactionary elements in people's worldviews and ideological consciousness, the people are increasingly establishing communist moral qualities and ideological consciousness, establishing new customs, new habits, promoting and developing the new culture and art of the proletariat, this culture and art come from the people and serve the people.

In response to Comrade Enver Hoxha's call to "mobilize the entire Party and the entire country to burn every person who tramples on the sacred laws of the Party that protect the rights of women, to smash his head," all our people, men, women, old, and young, have joined the movement for the complete liberation of women. This movement has great significance, especially in our country's conditions, because as our Party's documents say, "Without the complete liberation of this steadfast revolutionary force of women, it is impossible to imagine the freedom of the people and individuals, it is impossible to imagine the progress of the state and the achievement of our goals."

Our working people have also put forward many revolutionary initiatives in the economic field and launched many revolutionary movements, aiming to push the development of our productive forces to a new high tide, to further improve the socialist relations of production. After the Fifth Congress of the Party, in less than three months of record time, collectiveization was also successfully completed in some mountainous areas, thus our agriculture has been fully collectivized. The cooperative farmers themselves proposed to greatly reduce private plots and private livestock, compared to the past standards, private plots have been reduced by 50% to 65%, and private livestock has been reduced by 50%. While the workers of the state farms voluntarily gave up all their private plots according to their own initiatives. The Party educates our working people to resolutely oppose bourgeois and revisionist ideas, to oppose the encouragement of narrow personal interests, personal enjoyment, and personal comfort, placing them above everything else. Our working people voluntarily give up additional remuneration and income outside of basic wages, placing spiritual rewards in the first place, always placing the sublime interests of the people's homeland and socialism above everything else. They also hand over government bonds to the state, which is another manifestation of their high patriotism and revolutionary spirit.

To implement the Party's great slogan of "opening up the hills and turning the hills into a sea of grain," our country has launched a magnificent movement to support the countryside. Our youth participate in voluntary labor, build railways, build roads in the mountains, and undertake many local projects. In these places, every year, tens of thousands of young men and women participate in voluntary labor, are educated in the great school of labor, and temper themselves into the glorious successors of the revolutionary forerunners who laid the foundations of socialism.

The cause of revolution and socialism is the cause of the masses. Our Party has always insisted on the mass line, firmly relying on the masses, promoting the initiative of the masses, and insisting on respecting the masses and learning from the masses before educating the masses. Therefore, our Party's relationship with the masses is close, and it stands unshakable. Now, this mass line has been further developed and is increasingly deeply developing. Today, the initiative of our masses has reached an unprecedented height. The masses are participating in many major revolutionary movements of political, ideological, cultural, economic, scientific, and military nature. The masses participating in these movements not only transform the objective world but also transform themselves, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, worldviews, and their lives and work. This is the most important characteristic of our current life.

Due to the initiative of the masses, the self-reliance, and the direct and wide participation of the masses in formulating our country's economic plans, these plans are being successfully implemented in all fields. The results of the first two years of the implementation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan clearly show this. These two years of plans have not only been completed but have also been over-fulfilled in many sectors.

Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." This is a great truth. In our country, freedom and people's power also come from the barrel of a gun. Similarly, the barrel of a gun will defend freedom and people's power from being violated by anyone. Therefore, our Party has always attached great importance to strengthening national defense forces, greatly strengthening our people's army, and promoting the militarization of the entire people. In recent years, a series of important measures have been taken in this regard: Party committees have been established in all units and military institutions, the system of political commissars at all levels in the army has been restored to strengthen Party leadership in the army, establish the correct relationship between military and political affairs, highlight political work for people, because people are the first factor, weapons are the second factor, because ultimately, the outcome of war is decided by people; the army has abolished military ranks to further strengthen the relationship between officers and soldiers, fight against any bad manifestations among officers, consolidate the unity within the army—which is one of the main sources of the army's power and strength; the tasks of the army are to take up the pickaxe while holding the gun, to be self-reliant, so as to achieve self-sufficiency in all food in a short time; and measures have been taken to strengthen the military training of the entire people, etc.

Albania is a peace-loving socialist country. It has not, does not, and will not bully anyone. We have always advocated maintaining normal relations with our neighboring countries and all countries. However, we cannot turn a blind eye to the threats of the enemy and the worsening international situation, tying our own hands. We are prepared on all fronts to deal with any eventuality, any aggression, and any invading forces from any direction.

Comrade Hoxha, in the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front held in September this year, once again sternly warned all those who have plans to invade our country. He said: "Run away with your tails between your legs, if you dare to venture in, we will punish you severely; if you attack our borders, we will turn you into stinking corpses; if you think you have the advantage in manpower and weapons and can swallow socialist Albania in one bite, come and try; if you want to bring the fire of war to our borders, then we warn you, the fire you light will burn, and you will have to pay the price; ... if you invade our borders, you must understand that the aid to socialist Albania to defend Albania has no borders."

Dear comrades:

We live in a great historical era where two worlds are engaged in a life-and-death struggle. One is the old world, the capitalist and imperialist world, heading towards an inevitable abyss; the other is the new world, the world of free peoples, the world of socialism and communism. The future belongs to the new world. In this great struggle, the forces of revolution are stronger than the forces of counter-revolution, and victory is increasingly clear. This is an irresistible law of history. Nothing can stop the progress of the world revolution, and nothing can save the old world from destruction. In the face of this objective law of social development, whether it is the atomic weapons of imperialism, the betrayal of revisionism, or the alliance of imperialist-revisionists, all are powerless.

American imperialism is the arch-criminal of the capitalist and imperialist world, and the Soviet revisionist leadership is their active accomplice. These two are colluding with each other, their ultimate goal being the domination of the two superpowers over the world, the elimination of socialism, and the strangulation of the liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries. But their death, their being buried by the peoples of all countries, is inevitable. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "If the American monopoly capitalists insist on pursuing their policy of aggression and war, they will one day be hanged by the people of the world. Other American accomplices will also meet the same fate."

At present, the focus of the struggle of the peoples of all countries against American imperialism, this international aggressor and gendarme, is the war in Vietnam. Heroic Vietnam is a vivid example of the indestructible power of the peoples of the world and people's war, exposing the weakness of the most savage and powerful imperialism—America. Heroic Vietnam is a great source of inspiration for the peoples of the world, teaching them how to resist and oppose imperialism and its oppression and aggression.

The Party, government, and people of Albania have fully supported and will continue to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country, the only correct way to solve the Vietnamese problem, which is to continue the armed struggle against the American aggressors and their lackeys to the end without compromise, and condemn the vicious conspiracy of "bombing for peace" by American imperialism and the betrayal and deception of "stopping the bombing for peace" by Khrushchev revisionists. The fate of the Vietnamese people's war is not decided on the negotiating table but on the battlefield. Only the gun is the final speaker, because freedom comes from the barrel of a gun, not from the negotiating table with the enemy.

Recently, American imperialists and their tools, such as Israel, have provoked a new armed conflict against the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan and other Arab countries and peoples in the Middle East. The Middle East incident once again shows that where plunder and aggression wars break out, there is the bloody claw of American imperialism. To suppress the peoples of all countries, plunder their wealth, and extinguish the flames of revolution, American imperialism is using all kinds of adventures and committing heinous crimes. The Middle East incident also exposes the true faces of the cowards and traitors led by the Soviet leadership and Tito revisionists, the false friends of the peoples of all countries, and the true allies of imperialists, once again proving that relying on revisionism is like relying on a rotten plank, believing them is believing Judas.

The Arab peoples have suffered a setback, but they have not been defeated, losing a battle is not the whole struggle. We believe that the Arab peoples have great power to resist aggression and defeat the aggressors. We hope they will learn the necessary lessons from their failures, strengthen their unity on a solid foundation, clearly distinguish true friends from false friends, not harbor illusions about imperialism, and not believe the revisionists. The Arab peoples are not alone in their just struggle. They have the support of the revolutionary peoples of the world. The Albanian people were with them in the past and will be with them in the future. Close friendship binds the brotherly Arab peoples and the Albanian people together.

The global strategy of American imperialism has long been shifted to the Far East. The main target of this strategy is the People's Republic of China. All the reactionary cliques of Asia and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet leadership have also taken action. All the counter-revolutionary forces are now united in a "holy alliance" to "control" and sabotage the People's Republic of China—this strong fortress of revolution and socialism. But the anti-China conspiracies of the world reactionaries are doomed to fail. The days when China could be trampled, plundered, and butchered are gone forever. Today's China has a master. It is a great socialist country, defending the 700 million Chinese people armed with the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao under the leadership of the Communist Party. The enemies of the Chinese people think that the "situation in China is chaotic," using it to achieve their purposes. They have miscalculated. The situation in China is excellent. It has never been as good as it is today. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has eliminated the revisionist traitors, defeated the Chinese Khrushchevs and their cohorts, and unprecedentedly raised the revolutionary fighting spirit and firmness of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are ready to defend the victory of the revolution and the socialist motherland. If they dare to wage a war against China, then this anti-China war will turn into a borderless world conflict, burying the imperialists and all their reactionary and revisionist lackeys and running dogs in the grave. Whoever dares to touch China will perish.

The American imperialists and Soviet revisionist traitors are trying to dominate the world with their two superpowers. They are increasingly tightening their collusion. The Glassboro talks between the butcher Johnson and the traitor Kosygin are a very dangerous new stage in this collusion. This is another new conspiracy of imperialism and revisionism behind the backs of the people, against the vital interests of the people. Life with increasingly new facts proves that the Soviet-American alliance is a great danger to the peoples of all countries. Therefore, exposing and smashing this unprecedented counter-revolutionary alliance is the fundamental and urgent task of the revolutionary peoples of the world today.

People are increasingly seeing that under today's conditions, if imperialism and its accomplices, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet leadership, are not simultaneously opposed, the struggle against imperialism cannot be victorious. There can be no talk of any unity with Soviet revisionism. They are enemies of the people and socialism, fire brigades to extinguish the revolution, traitors to Marxism-Leninism. If anyone talks about unity with them, it means that in fact, they have slid to the position of revisionism, adapted to their traitorous line, and the interests of the Soviet-American collusion. The so-called "middle road," "third road," "special road" in the communist movement has never existed and cannot exist. There cannot be and cannot maintain any "bridge" between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. All bridges have been cut off, every matter separates Marxist-Leninists from revisionists, and nothing can unite Marxist-Leninists with revisionists.

The revolutionary communists and peoples of the Soviet Union, the revolutionary communists and peoples of other countries where the revisionist clique is in power—their time to speak has come. The revolutionary forces of the world will soon celebrate the 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution. Call the Bolsheviks from the grave, first call the great people of the Soviet Union, Lenin, Stalin, to mobilize people to fight, to carry forward their glorious revolutionary traditions in the heroic days of the Red October, to carry forward the epic traditions of the civil war and the great patriotic war, to overthrow the traitorous clique riding on their heads, destroying the cause of the October Revolution—Lenin and Stalin's cause, turning the Soviet Union from a revolutionary and socialist fortress into an imperialist, chauvinist country that strangles the revolution and allies with American imperialism.

Dear comrades:

Our two parties, two peoples, and two countries have forged a great and unbreakable friendship. This is a sincere, fighting, revolutionary friendship. This friendship was forged and strengthened in the common struggle for the common goal of opposing imperialism and revisionism, carrying out the revolution, and achieving the victory of socialism. It was tempered by our two parties and our two great leaders, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Hoxha.

The Albanian-Chinese friendship is a shining example of the relationship between communist parties and socialist countries based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The characteristics and vitality of this friendship are particularly clearly embodied in the historic telegram of congratulations from Comrade Mao Zedong to our Fifth Congress. Our Party members and all the people enthusiastically welcome the telegram from Comrade Mao Zedong. It is a sublime expression of internationalist solidarity, a great support and aid to our Party and people. We thank Comrade Mao Zedong for this high evaluation of our people and our Party.

Our Party and people have always regarded the revolutionary friendship with the people of China as a great victory for our country and for the communist cause. Therefore, our Party and people will cherish this friendship like the apple of their eye and will continue to strengthen this friendship. There is no doubt that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the revolutionary progress of the life of the Albanian state will temper this friendship and raise it to a new, higher stage. We believe that the current visit of our Party and government delegation to China will be another contribution to strengthening the great Albanian-Chinese friendship.

Our Party has pointed out and reiterates: The Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China are an indestructible socialist fortress, a powerful revolutionary base, the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, the iron supporters and defenders of the revolutionary cause; unity with the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China is a basic principle of proletarian internationalism, a sacred duty of every true communist, all Marxist-Leninist forces, and revolutionary forces of the contemporary world. Whoever attacks and slanders China will reap what they sow, and whoever most fiercely attacks and slanders China will suffer the most severe defeat.

The Party of Labor of Albania and the Albanian people, firmly united, have forged a solid friendship and will, as always, advance shoulder to shoulder with the great Communist Party of China and the heroic 700 million Chinese people. Whether in good times or difficult times, whether in sunny days or cloudy times, whether in calm days or stormy times, our two parties, two peoples, and two countries will forever stand together, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, opposing imperialism and revisionism, and advancing on the road of revolution and socialism!

Long live the great friendship and revolutionary unity between Albania and China!

Long live the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!

Long live the heroic revolutionary masses of Jinan City and Shandong Province!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese Party and people, the successor of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, our Party and people's most respected friend, Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live!

    谢胡同志在山东省和济南市革命群众欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团大会上讲话
    中国文化大革命是无产阶级专政下前所未有的伟大革命  毛泽东思想为七亿人民所掌握变成不可摧毁的物质力量
    美帝和苏修相互勾结扼杀各国人民的解放斗争，他们被各国人民埋葬是不可避免的
    新华社济南五日电　谢胡同志四日在山东省和济南市革命群众欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的康生同志：亲爱的王效禹同志：山东省和济南市的工人同志们，农民同志们，人民解
  放军的战士和干部们，革命派和红卫兵战士们：
    我们，阿尔巴尼亚共产党人和人民的代表来到你们强大的国家进行友好访问。今天，山东省和济南市的工人、红卫兵、所有革命群众给予我们的盛大的、热烈的和亲切的欢迎，我们很受感动。我们衷心地感谢你们这种热烈的兄弟般的欢迎，并把它看成是你们和全体伟大的中国人民对我们党、我们人民、我们国家的深情厚谊的高度表现。
    我们很高兴有机会访问你们这个有五千七百万人口的山东省的省会，访问这座七十二泉的美丽城市，这座为反抗日本军国主义，反对国民党反动匪帮进行过英勇斗争的济南市。十九年前，毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党所领导的英雄的中国人民解放军解放了这座城市。我们今天能同你们——社会主义革命的坚定的战士、毛主席的马克思列宁主义思想忠实执行者举行会见，感到莫大的高兴。八个月前，你们坚持中国共产党十一中全会关于无产阶级文化大革命的革命的方针，胜利地实现了大联合、三结合，造了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，粉碎了他们，把无产阶级专政的命运牢牢地掌握在自己的手里，建立了山东省革命委员会。这对于济南人民和你们伟大的山东省人民来说，是一九四八年九月胜利以后的最伟大的胜利。这个胜利对于你们整个社会主义祖国的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进军，起了巨大的影响。
    济南市和山东省的劳动群众，和全中国人民一样，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的伟大的中国共产党的领导下，在不到二十年的时间内，在社会主义建设中取得了极大的成就，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了光辉的胜利。
    趁此机会，请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国党政代表团，代表阿尔巴尼亚共产党员和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，并以我们的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的名义，向你们——革命的工人、红卫兵、人民解放军代表、济南市的革命干部和山东省的全体革命群众，致以热烈的、共产主义的敬礼，并衷心祝愿你们取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，祝愿毛泽东主席的伟大思想的红旗取得彻底的胜利。
    我们代表团访问中国期间，正当中国进行两件大事，即：中国人民革命胜利和中华人民共和国建国十八周年；无产阶级文化大革命的风暴席卷整个中国。这两次革命，是中国人民生活中的两件大事，这是具有世界历史意义的两次革命。
    中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的建立，对于各国人民的命运来说，是俄国十月革命胜利之后最伟大的、最重要的革命转折点。这个革命，结束了封建主义、帝国主义在中国的压迫和剥削，使中国走上了社会主义发展的道路，致命地打击了帝国主义的后方阵地，使世界力量的对比发生了有利于社会主义的巨大变化。中国革命，成了鼓舞各国革命人民特别是亚非拉人民的伟大榜样，是取得丰富经验的样板。今天，亚非拉已经成了当代革命风暴的地区。
    由中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是中国革命的继续和发展，是新型的革命，是无产阶级专政下前所未有的革命。这场革命，内容深刻，目的远大，目标正确，行动革命化。这是两种相反的路线、两个对立的阶级和两条对立的道路之间的严峻的阶级斗争。革命的矛头是针对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这场大革命是要防止修正主义者、资产阶级的代理人篡夺政权，捍卫无产阶级专政，并把中国的革命事业和社会主义事业推向前进。从这个观点出发，无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，是无产阶级对资产阶级的胜利，是革命对反革命的胜利，是社会主义对资本主义的胜利，是以毛主席为代表的革命路线对以中国的赫鲁晓夫及其追随者彭德怀、彭真、罗瑞卿、陆定一、陶铸等为代表的资产阶级反动路线的胜利。
    因此，完全有理由说，无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，是继一九四九年十月人民革命之后中国人民历史上第二次伟大胜利。如果说，中华人民共和国的建立是人民伟大革命的历史性胜利，为中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设开辟了道路，那么，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利堵死了破坏革命成果和在中国复辟资本主义的道路。
    中国共产党和毛泽东主席的伟大的历史功绩是，他们不但教会了中国的工人阶级和中国人民怎样推翻地主、资本家和帝国主义者的统治，怎样进行社会主
  义革命和社会主义建设，而且，他们还总结了国内和国际的无产阶级专政的经验，特别总结了在修正主义集团已经掌了权的苏联和其他几个社会主义国家发生的修正主义悲剧的经验。领导七亿革命的中国人民进行无产阶级文化大革命，教导他们怎样叫修正主义“停车”。怎样防止资本主义复辟，怎样保卫社会主义胜利果实，使人民中国永远不改变颜色，而永远做为国际共产主义的强大的突击队奋勇前进。
    这场革命不但对中国人民的命运有生死攸关的意义，而且对各国共产主义者和革命人民，对反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的斗争，对世界革命事业具有生死攸关的意义。人民中国是社会主义的伟大堡垒，马克思列宁主义的旗手，世界人民强大的革命基地。是帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和一切反动派实现他们反革命计划的不可逾越的障碍。谁都知道，如果让苏联的修正主义悲剧在中国重演，那么将对中国人民和全世界人民产生怎样可怕后果。所以世界共产党人和革命人民为资产阶级、帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在中国的代理人反共、反华阴谋的失败而叫好，欢迎无产阶级文化大革命，为这一革命的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，全体党员和全体人民，同中国共产党和中国人民结成了牢不可破的革命的战斗友谊，把他们看成是自己最亲密、最伟大和最忠实的朋友、同盟者和兄弟，过去和现在全力支持无产阶级文化大革命，坚决谴责中国的赫鲁晓夫及其追随者的资产阶级、修正主义的反革命路线和活动，完全支持中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最尊贵和最敬爱的朋友毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的革命路线。
    我国党员和人民十分关切地注视着中国无产阶级文化大革命的开展，我们把这场伟大革命的每一个胜利都看成是我国革命的胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命的主力军——广大工农兵，革命学生，革命知识分子和革命干部，在党的领导下，已经作出了巨大的工作。他们给了旧世界的一切污泥浊水，剥削阶级的旧思想旧文化旧风俗旧习惯以致命的打击。揭露和打击了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派并正在彻底粉碎他们，批倒批臭了科学、文艺界的资产阶级反动学术“权威”，改造了和正在改造一切不符合社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。这样，无产阶级文化大革命不仅消除了当前威胁中国的危险，而且还正在铲除散布修正主义和复辟资本主义的任何社会基础，从而永远保证社会主义胜利和向共产主义迈进。
    帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派和工人阶级的叛徒被中国的无产阶级文化大革命吓破了胆。他们恶毒地攻击中国共产党和中国人民，特别是咒骂无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东同志。以勃列日涅夫和柯西金的苏联修正主义集团为首的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在这次反华高潮中，充当了黑打手。这是一件应该使我们高兴的大好事。这说明中国的无产阶级文化大革命打中了敌人的要害。他们的疯狂，表明他们对中国的资本主义和修正主义阴谋的破产的惊惶不安，说明他们害怕中国革命造反的榜样将鼓舞各国革命派和人民起来革命，推翻他们的统治，说明他们被中国人民的伟大的革命风暴吓得晕头转向，这一革命风暴表现了中国人民的不可战胜的力量。
    毛泽东同志说：“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命正在取得历史性的胜利。这再次向全世界清楚地表明：中国共产党是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的党，人民中国是一个伟大的社会主义国家，一个坚不可摧的革命的堡垒，毛泽东同志是伟大的领袖，是伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是伟大的无产阶级革命家，表明没有任何力量能使中国向后转，表明中国国内外的敌人的一切阴谋是注定要失败的。
    无产阶级文化大革命是历史上最广泛、最深刻和最伟大的革命群众运动，真正地体现了无产阶级专政下的广泛的民主，它标志着群众空前地发挥了生动的积极性和创造性，它必将以新的十分宝贵的经验来丰富无产阶级专政的理论和实践。在这场运动中，我们看到更广泛和更坚决地贯彻群众路线，看到充分相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众和尊重群众的革命首创精神和创造能力。这正是中国共产党和无产阶级专政的巨大力量和不可摧毁的所在，正是无产阶级文化大革命粉碎一切障碍和实现其崇高目标的保证。
    无产阶级文化大革命是在毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想指导下进行的，它的胜利就是这种思想的伟大胜利。这种思想，一贯为中国共产党和中国人民指出唯一正确的道路，并引导他们从胜利走向胜利。我们十分满意地看到，并感到无限兴奋的是，无产阶级文化大革命把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了一个新高潮，并把它提高到了一个新的更高阶段。今天人民中国成了一所马克思列宁主义的大学校，在那里马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想已经成了亿万群众每日的精神食粮，它教育和鼓舞群众生活中的每一行动。
    七亿中国人民的广大群众掌握毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想是一个活生生的伟大榜样，是马克思关于理论一旦为群众所掌握就可变成不可摧毁的物质力量的原理的光辉证明。
    无产阶级文化大革命，使人们的思想革命化，提高了人们的政治觉悟，和革命精神，推动了并必将推动生产力、经济、人民文化和科学技术的进一步迅猛发展。全国贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的口号，以及自力更生和突出无产阶级政治的原则，遵循党的“多、快、好、省”建设社会主义的总路线，并胜利地开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。大庆石油工人，大寨生产大队和人民解放军的榜样鼓舞着工人阶级、劳动农民和全体人民去进行革命和建设社会主义的新中国。目前开展的“拥军爱民”的运动是向人民解放军学习和全力支持人民解放军的又一十分重要的运动，因为人民解放军是忠于毛泽东的革命路线的中国革命人民的军队，是无产阶级用来镇压一切敌人的主要工具，是无产阶级文化大革命的强大支柱，是中国人民历史性胜利的可靠保证。
    伟大的中国正在社会主义的道路上阔步前进，它正在进一步成为拥有巨大的经济军事力量，拥有不断增长的国际威望和作用的强国。中国的科学技术和工业所达到的水平，最集中地反映在核试验、含有热核材料的导弹核武器和今年最近一次的第一颗氢弹的试验方面。掌握在人民中国手中的核武器和导弹，是中国人民和世界各国革命人民的又一伟大胜利，是进一步加强反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义，争取民族解放和社会解放的斗争的有力鼓舞。它是对各国人民的敌人的又一沉重打击。作为讹诈和侵略工具的帝修核垄断和热核垄断破产了。他们的“防止核扩散”的阴谋失败了。他们“遏制”中国的计划被粉碎了。
    我们为中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命，在社会主义建设、加强国防力量方面所取得的各项成绩感到由衷的高兴，并祝你们在各条战线上取得新的、越来越大的新胜利。
    亲爱的同志们：
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，象一个不可战胜的、革命的、社会主义的和马克思列宁主义的堡垒一样，屹立在亚得里亚海边，屹立在资本主义和修正主义的欧洲的心脏，被无数敌人包围着。阿尔巴尼亚正在卓有成效地完成着她的国内外的革命任务，正在一手拿镐，一手拿枪地向前迈进。
    我们党的第五次代表大会召开以来，将近一年了。这次代表大会再次表明我们党、政权、经济和我们的社会制度及国家制度的力量和巩固，表明了以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的我们的党所奉行的马克思列宁主义路线的正确性，表明了象野兽一般地攻击我们党和我们人民的苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义的敌对行动的破产。代表大会说明：小国阿尔巴尼亚是不可战胜的，说明阿尔巴尼亚不仅顶住了帝国主义和修正主义敌人的一切攻击、阴谋诡计，而且在社会主义建设的各条战线上取得了巨大成就，永远前进。
    我国解放以后，我们党和我国人民经历的最困难的时刻，当赫鲁晓夫“预言”阿尔巴尼亚将被迫向他屈服的时候，我们得到了光荣的中国共产党和伟大的中国人民的兄弟般的完全国际主义的援助和支持。在人民中国不得不克服由于严重的自然灾害和赫鲁晓夫修正主义和美帝国主义的封锁而造成的困难的时候，人民中国给予的这一无私的援助，是联结我们两党、两国和两国人民的伟大团结和友谊的崇高表现。亲爱的同志们，请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚党、政府和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，对你们伟大的共产党，你们政府，你们英雄的人民和毛泽东主席为我国人民和我国所做的，以及正在做的一切，表示衷心的感谢。
    我们党的第五次代表大会，将作为制定了国家全部生活、党、政权、生产、教育、文化和人的思想进一步革命化的劳动和斗争纲领的代表大会，记载在我们党和我国人民的历史上。最近，在这方面，我们党采取了一系列的措施和重要决议，并写在党的许多文件上。
    在我国正在蓬勃开展着席卷全体劳动人民，从少先队员到老年人的伟大革命运动。这个革命运动的主要内容是什么呢？它的主要目的是：根除一切产生和传播修正主义的基础，堵塞复辟资本主义的道路，保证革命的不断发展，保卫已取得的胜利，把阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义和共产主义事业推向前进。
    在这个问题上，我们是以这样一个马克思列宁主义原理为出发点的，即剥削阶级作为一个阶级消灭了以后，阶级斗争还继续着，它仍然是从资本主义过渡到共产主义的整个时期的社会主义主要的动力。只要这种阶级斗争在国内外还继续着，社会主义的胜利就还没有得到保证，就继续存在资本主义复辟的危险，这种复辟不仅来自外部，来自帝国主义的武装侵略，而且主要来自内部，来自资产阶级—修正主义的腐蚀。
    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上，霍查同志说：“任何放弃阶级斗争的表现都会给社会主义的命运带来致命的后果。所以，在进行增加生产、发展文化教育的斗争的同时，在同国外敌人——帝国主义者和修正主义者进行斗争的同时，绝不应该放弃和忘记国内的阶级斗争。否则，历史将严惩我们。”
    我们党在对外战线上，和在对内战线上，一直进行正确的、一贯的阶级斗争。我们党对一切阶级敌人，对党内外一切敌人，进行了坚决的斗争。
    我们党一向意识到：阶级敌人要压倒人民，首先就必须打倒党；因此，这些敌人一贯内外配合反对我们党。我们党为了捍卫自己的正确路线、马克思列宁主义原则和它队伍的纯洁性，不使受到外部任何反党敌对分子的侵蚀，进行了长期的革命斗争。我们党不允许党内存在相反的路线，存在破坏党的思想行动的一致和构成党与人民严重危险的各种派别。我们党对于那些后来站到反党反社会主义立场上的所有那些人都曾经耐心地采用解释、说服的手段，但是，当他们十恶不赦、不愿纠正，并继续走叛变的道路，我们党就对他们毫不犹豫地采取相应的措施。
    党是人民的心脏和中枢，是无产阶级专政的领导力量。不断加强党，捍卫党的队伍的纯洁性，加强同群众的联系，始终如一地执行党内生活的马克思列宁主义准则，提高社会主义建设一切环节中的党的领导作用，改善党的工作方法和工作作风——这一切就是进一步使党革命化的我们工作的最主要的几个方面。
    我们党和我国人民正在进行反对官僚主义及其传播者，为巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。苏联发生的修正主义悲剧的教训清楚地说明：不同官僚主义和官僚主义者，无产阶级专政的危险敌人进行坚决的斗争，就不能避免社会主义向资本主义蜕变。反对官僚主义和反对官僚主义者的斗争，是社会主义社会阶级斗争的最重要的方面之一。这是一场长期的、复杂的斗争。只要阶级斗争继续存在，只要无产阶级的国家本身存在，阶级斗争就将继续下去。
    这场斗争的实质是同建立干部与群众、机关工作人员与劳动者之间的正确关系有关的，其目的是不让建立一个特权的、官僚主义的阶层，不让人民的勤务员变成人民的统治者，否则就为他们篡夺政权和复辟资本主义开辟道路。
    我们党在这个基本问题上一向奉行一条正确的路线。事实是，我们这里没有发生的事情在修正主义集团当权的苏联和其他欧洲社会主义国家发生了。这就清楚地说明：在阿尔巴尼亚，修正主义找不到它的反革命活动的社会依靠。但是我们认真地估计了这个问题，最近，我国采取了一系列具有重大政治思想意义的措施，如：在不影响低工资和中等工资的情况下两次降低高工资，建立更加合理的比例；干部、行政人员、一切知识分子、青年学生广泛地、普遍地同工农一道，直接参加生产劳动；中央和基层之间有计划地、经常地轮换干部；干部、共产党员和政府机构的全体职工接受人民群众的严格监督；提高人民选出来的政权机构和人员的作用、权限和权力；一丝不苟地贯彻民主集中制，反对任何官僚主义集中制的表现；改善工作方法和工作作风，把政权机构的主要注意力引导到做人的活的工作中去，引导到检查执行决定和任务方面，引导到不用“纯技术观点”和“经济主义”来看待一切国家和经济问题，而是党的政治思想方面，时时刻刻突出政治。
    阿尔巴尼亚根据自己的条件，正在胜利进行思想文化革命，这是当前我们国内阶级斗争的主要战线，这是一场尖锐的长期的和具有历史意义的斗争，我们党的第五次代表大会指出，“只要思想文化领域里的社会主义革命不获全胜，那么，政治和经济领域里的社会主义革命胜利也就没有保证。因此，在思想战线上彻底消灭资产阶级和修正主义思想的斗争，归根到底关系到：是建设社会主义和共产主义，防止资本主义复辟，还是为散布资产阶级和修正主义思想大开方便之门，重新回到资本主义的问题。”
    人是革命、建设、斗争和工作的决定性因素，无论是革命还是反革命都要做人的工作，所以用什么方法教育人，用什么思想观念引导人，这是人们一切行动方向的出发点。修正主义并不是什么别的东西，它是资产阶级的政治、思想和精神蜕化的产物。反对资产阶级和修正主义的斗争，反对一切剥削阶级思想意识的表现方法的斗争，就是反对阶级敌人在意识形态方面进行抵抗的斗争，这个抵抗比政治、军事的抵抗更深入更强大。只有当我们击败这一抵抗时，正如列宁所说，那时才将给我们正在把它埋葬的资本主义社会的棺材上钉上最后一颗钉子。
      “象革命者那样思考、工作和生活”这是我们党教育劳动者的一切思想工作的口号。青年、工人阶级、合作社农民、人民知识分子贯彻执行这个伟大的革命口号，向资产阶级和修正主义的思想意识的表现和封建家长制的落后习惯、宗教迷信和偏见、官僚主义以及一切违背我国社会主义制度和思想意识的东西发动了总攻击。这场革命斗争的火焰，正在烧掉旧的剥削阶级和旧的剥削制度给我们留下的一切毒草，这场革命斗争正在对人们的世界观和思想意识中的反动的东西进行大扫除，人民群众正在日益树立共产主义道德品质和思想意识，树立新风尚，新习惯，推动和发展无产阶级的新文化，新艺术，这个文化和艺术来自人民又是为人民服务的。
    为响应恩维尔·霍查同志关于“全党和全国都应发动起来，火烧每一个践踏党的保卫妇女权利的神圣法律的人，砸烂他的脑袋”的号召，我们全国人民男、女、老、少，都投入了彻底解放妇女的运动。这个运动具有巨大意义，特别是在我国的条件下，因为这正如我们党的文件中所说的：“没有妇女这一坚定的革命力量的彻底解放，就不能设想人民和个人的自由，就不能想象国家的前进和达到我们的目的。”
    我国劳动群众在经济领域里也提出了许多革命化倡议，开展了许多革命化运动，其目的是把发展我国生产力推向一个新高潮，进一步改善社会主义生产关系。党的第五次代表大会以后，在不到三个月的创纪录的时间内，在某些山区也胜利地完成了集体化，这样我国农业全部实现了集体化。合作社农民自己提出倡议，大大减少自留地和自留牲口，同过去的标准相比，自留地缩小百分之五十到百分之六十五，自留牲口减少百分之五十。而国营农场工人则根据自己提出的倡议自愿地全部放弃过去的自留地。党教育我国劳动人民坚决反对资产阶级和修正主义思想，反对把助长人们追求金钱，追求物质刺激的狭隘的个人利益、个人享乐和个人安逸放在一切之上。我国劳动人民自愿放弃额外报酬和基本工资以外的其他收入，把精神奖励放在优先地位，永远把人民祖国和社会主义的崇高利益放在一切之上。他们还把公债券交给国家，这是他们的高度的爱国主义精神和革命精神的又一体现。
    为了贯彻党的具有巨大经济、政治、军事意义的口号“开辟山丘，变山丘为米粮川”，我国掀起了支援农村的轰轰烈烈的运动。我国青年参加义务劳动，修铁路，在山区筑公路，并从事许多地方性工程。在这些地方，每年有成千上万的青年男女从事义务劳动，在劳动的大学校里受教育，把自己锻炼成奠定社会主义基础的革命前辈的光荣的接班人。
    革命事业和社会主义事业，是群众的事业。我们党一贯坚持群众路线，坚持坚决依靠群众，发扬群众首创精神的路线，坚持尊重群众、先向群众学习，然后教育群众的路线。因此，我们党同群众的关系紧密，而立于不败之地。现在，这条群众路线得到了新的发展，正在日益深入地发展。今天，我国群众的积极性空前提高。群众投入具有政治、思想、文化、经济、科学、军事性质的许多重大的革命运动中。群众参加这些运动，不仅改造客观世界，而且也改造自己，促使人的思想、世界观及其生活、劳动的革命化。这是我国当前生活的最重要的特征。
    由于群众发挥了革命干劲，坚持了自力更生，由群众直接广泛参加制订我国的经济计划，这些计划在各个领域里都在胜利地实现着。第四个五年计划头二年执行的结果，清楚地说明了这一点。这二年的计划，不仅完成了，并且许多部门超额完成。
    毛泽东同志说，“枪杆子里面出政权”。这是一个伟大的真理。在我们这里，自由和人民政权也是出自枪杆子。同样，枪杆子还将保卫自由和人民政权不被任何人侵犯。因此，我们党一贯十分重视加强国防力量，十分重视不断加强我国的人民军队，十分重视全民皆兵。最近几年，在这方面采取了一系列重要措施：在所有部队和军事机构中建立了党委会，恢复了部队的各级政委制，以加强部队中党的领导，确立军事和政治的正确关系，突出对人的政治工作，因为人是第一因素，武器是第二因素，因为最终决定战争胜负的是人；军队取消了军衔，以进一步密切官兵关系，同军官中间产生的任何不好表现作斗争，巩固军队内部的团结——这是军队的威力和坚强之主要源泉之一；军队面临的任务是，拿枪的同时拿起镐头，自力更生，以便在短时间内实现一切食品的自给；并采取了措施，加强全民的军事训练，等等。
    阿尔巴尼亚，是一个爱好和平的社会主义国家。她过去，现在，将来都不会欺侮任何人。我们一贯主张同我们的邻国和一切国家保持正常关系。但是，对于敌人的威胁和正在恶化的国际局势，我们不能熟视无睹，而束缚自己的手脚。我们从各方面作好了准备，以应付任何事变、任何侵略和来自任何方面的侵略者联合军事力量。
    霍查同志在今年九月召开的民主阵线第四次代表大会上再一次十分严厉地警告所有对我国怀有侵略打算的人。他说：“夹着尾巴逃跑吧，如果你们胆敢冒险闯进来，我们就要严厉地惩罚你们；如果你们袭击我们的边境，我们就将使你们变成发臭的尸体；如果你们自以为人力和武器方面占优势，可以一口吃掉社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，那就来试试看吧；如果你们想把战火烧到我们边境上，那么我们要正告你们，由你们点的火将会燃烧起来，就要算这笔账；……如果你们侵犯我们的边境，你们必须懂得，为了保卫阿尔巴尼亚而给予社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的援助，就没有国界了。”
    亲爱的同志们：
    我们生活在一个伟大的历史时代，两种世界在进行你死我活的激烈搏斗。一个是旧世界，正在走向不可避免的深渊的资本主义和帝国主义世界；另一个是新世界，自由的各国人民的世界，社会主义和共产主义世界。未来属于新世界。在这场巨大的搏斗中，革命力量超过反革命力量，胜利越来越明显。这是一条不可抗拒的历史规律。任何东西也不能阻挡世界革命的进程，任何东西也不能挽救旧世界的毁灭。在社会发展这条客观规律面前，无论是帝国主义的原子武器，修正主义者的背叛，还是帝修的同盟，都是无能为力的。
    美帝国主义是资本主义和帝国主义世界的元凶，苏联修正主义领导是他们的积极帮凶。这两家互相勾结，其最终目的就是两大国主宰世界，消灭社会主义，扼杀各国人民的解放斗争。但是，他们的死亡，他们被各国人民埋葬是不可避免的。毛泽东同志指出：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”
    当前，各国人民反对美帝国主义这个国际侵略者和宪兵的斗争的焦点是越南战争。英雄的越南是显示各国人民和人民战争的不可摧毁的威力，暴露最野蛮和最强大的帝国主义——美国的虚弱的最生动的榜样。英雄的越南是世界各国人民的巨大鼓舞源泉，它教育各国人民应该如何抵抗和反对帝国主义及其压迫和侵略。　
    阿尔巴尼亚党、政府和人民过去和现在都毫无保留地支持越南人民的解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的正义斗争，过去和现在都支持解决越南问题的唯一正确途径，即毫不妥协地继续把反对美国侵略者及其仆从的武装斗争进行到底，过去和现在都谴责美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的恶毒阴谋以及赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的“停炸求和”的欺骗和背叛。越南人民战争的命运不是在谈判桌上，而是在战场上解决，只有枪杆子才是最后发言人，因为自由来自枪杆子，而不是来自同敌人和谈的谈判桌上。
    最近美帝国主义者及其工具以色列在中东挑起了反对阿联、叙利亚和约旦等阿拉伯国家和人民的新的武装冲突。中东事件再次表明，那里爆发掠夺和侵略战争，那里就有美帝国主义的血腥魔爪在插手。为了镇压各国人民，掠夺他们的财富，扑灭革命烈火，美帝国主义无所不用其极地进行种种冒险，犯下滔天罪行。中东事件还在全世界人民面前揭穿了以苏联领导为首的赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义的胆小鬼和投降者以及背信弃义和叛徒的真面目，暴露了他们是各国人民的假朋友，而是帝国主义者的真正盟友。这就再一次证明了依靠修正主义，就是靠在一块腐烂了的板子上，相信他们，就是相信犹大。
    阿拉伯人民遭到了挫折，但是他们没有被打败，他们失去一次战役并不是整个斗争。我们相信阿拉伯人民有巨大的力量抵抗侵略，打败侵略者。我们希望他们从失败中吸取必要的教训，将在牢固的基础上加强他们的团结，很好地分清真朋友和假朋友，不要对帝国主义抱有幻想，不要相信修正主义者。阿拉伯人民在他们的正义斗争中不是孤立的。他们有全世界革命人民的支持。阿尔巴尼亚人民过去和他们在一起，将来也和他们在一起，紧密的友谊把兄弟的阿拉伯人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民联结在一起。
    美帝国主义的全球战略早就移到了远东。这个战略的主要目标是人民中国。一切亚洲的反动集团和以苏联领导为首的现代修正主义者也行动起来了。一切反革命力量现在勾结在一个“神圣同盟”中，“控制”和破坏中华人民共和国——这个革命和社会主义的强大堡垒。而世界反动派的反华阴谋是注定要失败的。中国可以任人蹂躏、掠夺和宰割的时代一去不复返了。今日之中国是有主人的。她是一个伟大的社会主义国家，她保卫着在共产党领导下和由毛泽东主席的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的七亿中国人民。中国人民的敌人以为所谓“中国局势乱”，从而利用来达到他们的目的。他们打错了算盘。中国的形势是大好的。从来也没有象今天这样好。无产阶级文化大革命清除了修正主义叛徒，战胜了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，空前地提高了中国人民的革命的战斗精神和坚定性，中国人民严阵以待，保卫革命的胜利和社会主义祖国。如果敢于发动对中国的战争，那么这场反华战争将变成没有界线的一场世界大冲突，将把帝国主义及其一切反动派和修正主义仆从和走狗葬入坟墓。谁要触动一下中国，他就自取灭亡。
    美帝国主义者及苏修叛徒企图由他们两大国主宰世界，他们越来越加紧勾结。刽子手约翰逊和叛徒柯西金之间的葛拉斯堡罗会谈，是这一勾结的发展的非常危险的新阶段。这是帝国主义和修正主义背着人民干的又一新阴谋，是违背人民的切身利益的。生活以越来越新的事实证明苏美联盟对各国人民是巨大的危险。所以揭露和粉碎这一史无前例的反革命联盟，是今天全世界革命人民的根本的迫切的任务。
      人们日益清楚地看到，在今天的条件下，如果不同时反对帝国主义的同伙及其帮凶——以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义，反帝斗争就不能胜利。同苏联修正主义根本谈不上什么团结。他们是人民和社会主义的敌人，是扑灭革命的消防队，是马克思列宁主义的叛徒。如果谁要同他们讲什么团结，就意味着他事实上滑到了修正主义的立场上，适应了他们的叛徒路线，和苏美勾结的利益。所谓“中间路线”“第三条路线”“特殊路线”，在共产主义运动中过去没有，也不可能有，在马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间不能建立也不能保持任何“桥梁”，一切桥梁都已切断，每件事都使马克思列宁主义者同修正主义者分开，没有任何东西能使马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者联合起来。
      苏联的革命共产党人和人民，修正主义集团当权的其它国家的革命共产党人和人民——他们发言的时候到来了。全世界革命派今年即将庆祝伟大的十月革命五十周年。从陵墓里召唤布尔什维克，首先是召唤伟大苏联人民的列宁、斯大林，动员人们去战斗，发扬他们在红十月英雄日子里的光荣的革命传统，发扬他们史诗般的国内战争和伟大的卫国战争的传统，推翻骑在他们头上的、正在毁灭十月革命事业——列宁、斯大林事业的叛徒集团。这个叛徒集团把苏联从一个革命和社会主义的堡垒变成了一个扼杀革命、同美帝国主义结盟的帝国主义、沙文主义国家。
    亲爱的同志们：
    我们两党、两国人民和两国结成了伟大的和牢不可破的友谊。这是真诚的战斗的革命友谊。这种友谊是在反对帝国主义和修正主义，进行革命，争取实现社会主义胜利的共同目标的共同斗争中缔造起来和得到加强的。它是由我们两党和我们的两位伟大领袖毛泽东同志和霍查同志锤炼出来的。
    阿中友谊是在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上建立的共产党和社会主义国家之间关系的光辉范例。这一友谊的特点和生命力，十分清楚地体现在毛泽东同志致我们党的第五次代表大会的历史性的贺电中。我国党员和全体人民十分热烈地欢迎毛泽东同志的贺电。它是国际主义团结的崇高表现，是对我们党和人民的巨大支持和援助。我们感谢毛泽东同志对我国人民和我们党的这一高度评价。
    我们党和人民一贯把同人民中国的革命友谊，看成是对我国和对共产主义事业的伟大胜利。因此我们党和人民将象爱护眼珠一样爱护这一友谊，并不断加强这一友谊。毫无疑问，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，阿尔巴尼亚国家生活革命化的胜利进行，将锤炼这一友谊并把它提高到一个新的更高的阶段。我们认为目前我们党政代表团在中国的访问，将是加强阿中伟大友谊的又一贡献。
    我们党曾经指出并再一次重申：中国共产党和中华人民共和国是不可摧毁的社会主义堡垒，是强大的革命基地，是马克思列宁主义旗手，革命事业的钢铁般的依靠者和保卫者；同中国共产党和中华人民共和国的团结是无产阶级国际主义的基本准则，是每个真正的共产党、当代一切马克思列宁主义力量和革命力量的崇高义务。谁打击和诋毁中国，谁就将自食其果，谁最疯狂地攻击和诬蔑中国，谁就将遭到最惨重的失败。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民巩固地团结一致，结成巩固的友谊，将一如既往地同毛泽东的伟大的中国共产党和英雄的七亿中国人民并肩前进。无论在美好的日子里，还是在困难的时刻，无论在阳光灿烂的日子里，还是在阴云密布的时刻，也无论在平静的日子里，还是在惊涛骇浪的时刻，我们两党、两国人民和两个国家将永远团结在一起，高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，反对帝国主义和修正主义，在革命和社会主义道路上向前迈进！
    祝阿中伟大的友谊和革命团结永世长存，与日俱增！
    伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    英雄的济南市和山东省的无产阶级革命派万岁！
    祝中国党和人民的伟大领袖，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的继承者，我们党和人民的最尊贵的朋友毛泽东主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
