	Countless joyful faces, countless fervent hearts, and countless affectionate eyes gaze upon Tiananmen. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! How we miss you and how we love you! We will forever be loyal to you and forever follow you through the storms of class struggle.

	Our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao are striding towards us with vigorous steps! Instantly, the red sea of Tiananmen Square boils over, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" reverberate through the sky.

	Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the revolutionary people of the world. Japanese friends attending the National Day celebrations express their boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao with a large banner they meticulously made that reads, "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

	Our reporter Liu Zhenxiang

	The Little Red Guards of the capital carry a large banner reading "Support the Army, Love the People," and hold high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," marching through Tiananmen Square in an endless stream. They shout: Learn from the People's Liberation Army! Pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army! Push the movement to support the army and love the people to new heights!
