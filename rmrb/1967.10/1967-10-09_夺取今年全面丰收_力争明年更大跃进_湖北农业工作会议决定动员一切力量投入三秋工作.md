The revolutionary command center for agriculture of the proletarian revolutionaries of Hubei Province recently convened a provincial agricultural work conference. Representatives of the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary cadres from various places unanimously expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to further implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao, to mobilize all forces, and to actively engage in the intense work of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing. They aim to achieve "six excellences" in agriculture, to secure a bumper harvest this year, and to strive for even greater leaps in agricultural production next year.

This conference consistently raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to analyze, study, and understand all problems. The conference focused on studying central documents and the editorial "Achieving Six Excellences in Agriculture During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" from the People's Daily. Everyone agreed that the most important task at present is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism, and to use revolutionary criticism as a driving force to promote all work in the countryside, especially the current "three autumns" work. Revolutionary criticism in the countryside should be conducted during non-production hours, with production during the day and revolution at night, and revolution on the spot. Peasants should not go to the city to interfere with the cultural revolution in the cities.

The conference emphasized that during the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity should be achieved as soon as possible. At the same time, during the revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity, political and ideological work should be thoroughly and patiently done among the deceived masses. All forces that can be united should be united, and all positive factors should be mobilized to fully engage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the current work of autumn harvest, autumn sowing, and autumn plowing.

The conference required that the proletarian revolutionaries of the entire province must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on "grasp revolution, promote production" and "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." They must deeply understand that completing this year's "three autumns" is a very important political task. They must bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, mobilize all forces, and achieve good production, good harvesting, good seed selection, good procurement, good distribution, and good storage. For the autumn harvest, they must ensure a bumper harvest, insist on fine harvesting and threshing, good storage, strengthen security work, and prevent enemy sabotage.

The conference pointed out: The autumn sowing season is already very urgent, and the opportunity must not be missed. They must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao on "grain must be grasped, cotton must be grasped, and cloth must be grasped," quickly mobilize, and according to the state's requirements, implement the plan and do a good job in all preparations. While completing the grain sowing area, they must also arrange the production of various economic crops. They aim to make new achievements and contributions in this autumn sowing season.

    夺取今年全面丰收　力争明年更大跃进
    湖北农业工作会议决定动员一切力量投入三秋工作
    据新华社武汉八日电　湖北省无产阶级革命派抓革命促生产总指挥部最近召开了全省农业工作会议。到会的各地无产阶级革命派代表和革命领导干部一致表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，动员一切力量，积极投入紧张的秋收、秋耕、秋种工作，做到农业“六好”，夺取今年农业丰产丰收，力争明年农业更大跃进。
    这次会议，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，来分析、研究和认识一切问题。会议集中学习了中央有关文件和《人民日报》社论《在无产阶级文化大革命中做到农业六好》。大家认为，当前最重要的任务，就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起革命大批判的高潮，以革命的大批判为动力，推动农村各项工作，特别是推动当前的“三秋”工作。农村的革命大批判，要在生产以外的时间进行，白天搞生产，夜晚闹革命，就地闹革命，农民不要进城去干预城市的文化大革命。
    会议强调，要在革命的大批判中，尽快实现革命的大联合。同时要在革命的大批判和革命的大联合中，切实、耐心地做好受蒙蔽群众的政治思想工作，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，全力投入无产阶级文化大革命和当前的秋收、秋种、秋耕工作。
    会议要求，全省无产阶级革命派一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”、“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，深刻认识到抓好今年的“三秋”是一项极为重要的政治任务，一定要勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，动员一切力量，做到生产好，收割好，选种好，征购好，分配好，保存好。对于秋收，要切实做到丰产丰收，坚持细收细打，收好藏好，加强保卫工作，严防敌人捣乱破坏。
    会议指出：目前，秋播季节已很紧迫，机不可失，时不再来，一定要遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席关于“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的教导，迅速动员起来，按照国家要求，落实计划，搞好各项准备工作，在完成粮食播种面积的同时，安排好多种经济作物的生产，争取在今年秋播生产中，立下新功劳，作出新贡献。
