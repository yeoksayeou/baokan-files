Firmly Implementing Chairman Mao's Great Directive to Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism

Beijing's Various Fronts Hold Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes

The municipal revolutionary committee has established a specialized leading group to oversee this work, with the principal responsible comrades personally taking charge and providing specific guidance for the study classes. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who are responsible for "three supports" and "two militaries," are fully committed to organizing the study classes. They have brought the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army into the study classes, setting a good example for the revolutionary masses. Since October, over a thousand study classes have been established, with more than 70,000 participants.

According to a report from the *Beijing Daily*, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in Beijing's industrial, agricultural, financial, commercial, educational, and health sectors are following the latest directives of the great leader Chairman Mao, using "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Since October, over a thousand study classes have been established across the city, with more than 70,000 revolutionary masses, including leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres, participating in the first phase. Currently, the first phase of study classes is gradually concluding, and the second phase is being organized.

Holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the most urgent common wish of all revolutionary people in the city. With a single order from Vice Chairman Lin, every sector in the city immediately followed suit and got to work. The municipal revolutionary committee took the lead in organizing classes; the municipal workers' congress, farmers' congress, and red revolutionary committees of higher education institutions and secondary schools also organized classes; factories, schools, offices, shops, and rural areas all organized classes. In a very short time, Mao Zedong Thought study classes sprouted up all over the city like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In the industrial sector, many industries organized classes at the municipal, district, and factory levels, and even the revolutionary masses in workshops organized their own part-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the agricultural sector, 13 districts and counties in the suburbs, over 200 people's communes, and many production brigades and teams also organized study classes. The broad revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and new and old revolutionary cadres participating in the study classes, with deep class feelings for Mao Zedong Thought, eagerly and repeatedly studied and understood Chairman Mao's latest directives and the brilliant works of the "Old Five Articles," pushing the city-wide movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to an unprecedentedly broad and deep new height.

The municipal revolutionary committee attaches great importance to holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes and has established a specialized leading group to oversee this work. The principal responsible comrades of the municipal revolutionary committee personally take charge and provide specific guidance for the study classes. In recent meetings of the municipal revolutionary committee, the principal responsible comrades repeatedly emphasized: firmly implementing Chairman Mao's great directive to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, holding and running Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, is the key to all current work and the key to solving all problems. Recently, the principal responsible comrades of the municipal revolutionary committee visited the municipal workers' congress, farmers' congress, red revolutionary committees of higher education institutions and secondary schools, as well as some grassroots units' study classes, listened to reports about the study classes, understood the situation, and together with the masses, summarized the experience of organizing study classes, discovered and promoted advanced examples. Many principal responsible comrades of units and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations also seriously took charge of the work of study classes, and many participated directly in the study.

The Beijing Garrison and the People's Liberation Army units stationed in Beijing have given great support to the city's various sectors in organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who are active on the front lines of "three supports" and "two militaries," are fully committed to this central task. They are not only the organizers and leaders of the study classes but also the best students. They lead in exposing their thoughts and fighting selfishness, bringing the fine traditions and rich experiences of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works into the study classes, setting a good example for the revolutionary masses in the city.

Chairman Mao said: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao also said: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be resolved." Once Chairman Mao's series of latest directives are grasped by the masses, they become a tremendous material force. Through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, some units that had not yet achieved revolutionary great alliances have now united, and many units that had already achieved revolutionary great alliances by system, by industry, and by class have further leveled the ideological mountains and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance. Through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, a large number of revolutionary cadres have been educated, and the broad revolutionary masses have deepened their understanding of revolutionary cadres, thereby promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Many grassroots units have recently successfully established revolutionary committees. Through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit have been promoted, greatly advancing the revolution, production, work, and preparedness for war, and a new situation has emerged in the revolution, production, and work.

In the high tide of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes across the city, the broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses have seriously studied the advanced experiences of places like Xining and Shanghai, combined with the actual situation of their units, and initially explored some experiences in organizing study classes. The common feeling is:

1. Insist on political leadership, which is to insist on Mao Zedong Thought leadership. The most fundamental thing is to firmly grasp the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the key to running Mao Zedong Thought study classes well. The students of the study classes come from various different positions and bring various thoughts when they enter. Facing this situation, many study classes immediately focus on class education, using the "three remembrances and three comparisons" (remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; remembering the party's cultivation and education and comparing it with contributions to the party; remembering the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and comparing it with the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution), to arouse the students' deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, unify thoughts, and correct the attitude towards study. Throughout the study process, the study classes also insist on grasping living thoughts, using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to continuously solve various real-life thought problems, firmly establish the worldview of the proletariat, fundamentally raise the class consciousness of the students, and arouse the self-awareness of fighting selfishness.

2. The study classes combine three elements. The composition of the study classes follows the principle of three-in-one combination: leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, and the People's Liberation Army combine; old, middle, and young combine. During the study process, attention is also paid to combining internal and external elements. Many study classes' lectures, advanced example reports, and meetings are held among the masses. The study classes discuss the situation, discuss alliances, and fight selfishness. The masses also discuss the situation, discuss alliances, and fight selfishness, combining internal and external thoughts, communicating thoughts, and promoting each other.

3. The purpose is clear, and the focus is prominent. One phase of the study class focuses on solving one or two problems. Currently, the most widespread is to use "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, using Chairman Mao's latest directives as weapons, firmly grasping the living thoughts in the revolutionary great alliance, and consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance from a political and ideological perspective. The study materials also follow the principle of being few but excellent, with strong pertinence. The focus is on repeatedly studying and seriously understanding Chairman Mao's latest directives and the "Old Five Articles," combined with studying Vice Chairman Lin's National Day speech and other related documents. Generally, five or six documents are studied.

4. Self-education is the main focus, insisting on the principle of self-education and self-liberation from beginning to end. The study classes insist on the masses themselves raising questions, discussing and researching, and solving problems. Everyone is a student, and everyone is a teacher. The formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" is used to solve problems. Special emphasis is placed on making self-criticisms, exposing one's own wounds, and reforming oneself. The mass lectures, remembrance and comparison meetings, and accusation meetings are all good methods for the masses to educate themselves. Especially in grasping examples, using models to lead the way, inspiring each other, and jointly improving, using examples to promote the general situation, the effect is very good.

5. Political training and military training are combined. Many study classes, with the help of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, in addition to studying Chairman Mao's latest directives and the brilliant works of the "Old Five Articles" and fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, also conduct half an hour to an hour of military training every day, bringing the spirit of the People's Liberation Army into the study classes. The study classes require "thought revolutionization, organization militarization, and action battle-ization," enhancing organizational discipline, making the study classes both serious and tense in learning atmosphere and lively and lively in situation. The broad masses reflect very well: both literary and martial arts are learned, strengthening party spirit and organizational discipline. The good atmosphere of the study classes quickly spread to various units.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of Beijing Chemical Factory No. 4, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, using "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting the thought revolutionization of the proletarian revolutionary factions, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance from a thought perspective, and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

    坚决贯彻执行毛主席要斗私批修的伟大指示
    北京各条战线大办毛泽东思想学习班
    市革命委员会成立专门领导小组来抓这项工作，主要负责同志亲自挂帅，对学习班实行具体指导。担负“三支”“两军”的解放军指战员全力以赴地投入办学习班的工作。他们把人民解放军的优良传统带进了学习班，为革命群众树立了好榜样。十月份以来，已开办上千个学习班，学员达七万多人。
    新华社二十五日讯　据《北京日报》报道：首都工业、农业、财贸、文教卫生等各条战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，按照伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班。十月份以来，全市开办了上千个学习班，参加第一期学习的革命群众组织负责人、红卫兵小将和革命干部，共七万多人。目前，第一期学习班已陆续结业，第二期正在逐步开办起来。
    大办毛泽东思想学习班，是全市广大革命人民最最迫切的共同愿望。林副主席一声号令，全市各行各业立即紧紧跟上，一齐动手。市革命委员会带头办；市工代会办，农代会办，大专院校红代会和中等学校红代会也办；工厂办，学校办，机关办，商店办，农村也办。在很短的时间内，毛泽东思想学习班就如雨后春笋遍布于全市。在工业战线，不少行业市里办、区里办、工厂办，连车间的革命群众也自动组织起来开办了业余毛泽东思想学习班。在农业战线，郊区十三个区、县的二百多个人民公社和许多生产大队、生产队也普遍办起了学习班。参加学习的广大革命群众、红卫兵小将和新老革命干部，怀着对毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，如饥似渴地反复学习领会毛主席的最新指示以及“老五篇”等光辉著作，把全市活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，推向了一个空前广泛、深入的新高潮。
    市革命委员会对举办毛泽东思想学习班十分重视，已成立专门的领导小组来抓这项工作。市革命委员会主要负责同志亲自挂帅，对学习班实行具体指导。在市革命委员会最近召开的多次会议上，主要负责同志反复强调：坚决贯彻执行毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大指示，大办毛泽东思想学习班，办好毛泽东思想学习班，是当前一切工作的纲，是解决一切问题的关键和钥匙。最近，市革命委员会主要负责同志先后到市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中等学校红代会以及一些基层单位办的学习班去，听取关于学习班的汇报，了解情况，同群众一道，总结办学习班的经验，发现和推广先进典型。许多单位的主要负责人和革命群众组织的负责人，也认真抓学习班的工作，不少人还直接参加学习。
    北京卫戍区和人民解放军驻京部队，对全市各行各业举办毛泽东思想学习班，给予极大的支持。活跃在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军广大指战员，全力以赴地投入了这项中心工作，他们既是学习班的组织领导者，又是学习班最好的学员，他们带头亮思想，带头斗“私”字，把人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的优良传统和丰富经验，带进了学习班，为全市革命群众树立了好榜样。
    毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席又说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”毛主席一系列最新指示，一旦掌握了群众，就变成巨大的物质力量。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，有些原来没有实现革命大联合的单位，现在联合起来了，很多已经实现了按系统、按行业、按班级革命大联合的单位，进一步从思想上铲平山头，巩固和发展革命的大联合。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，使大批革命干部受到了教育，使广大革命群众增进了对革命干部的了解，从而促进了革命的三结合，一批基层单位已在最近顺利建立了革命委员会。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，促进了革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，大大推动了抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，革命、生产、工作出现了新面貌。
    在全市大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮里，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真学习了西宁、上海等地的先进经验，结合本单位的实际情况，在实践中初步摸索到了一些举办学习班的经验，大家的共同体会是：
      （一）坚持政治挂帅，就是坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，最根本的是要狠抓对待毛泽东思想的态度问题，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这是办好毛泽东思想学习班的关键。学习班的学员来自各个不同的岗位，入学时都带着各色各样的活思想。针对这种情况，许多学习班一上来就大抓阶级教育，通过三忆三比（忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆党的培养教育，比对党的贡献；忆党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，比无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就），激发学员对毛主席和毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，统一思想，端正学习态度。在学习的过程中，学习班还要自始至终狠抓活思想，坚持运用毛泽东思想这一锐利的武器，不断解决各种现实思想问题，大立无产阶级世界观，从根本上提高学员的阶级觉悟，启发斗私的自觉性。
      （二）学习班搞三个结合。学习班的组成，按照三结合的原则：革命群众组织负责人、革命干部和人民解放军相结合；老、中、小相结合。在学习过程中，还注意内外结合。许多学习班的讲用会、先进典型报告会，都到群众中去举行。学习班谈形势、谈联合、搞斗“私”，群众也谈形势、谈联合、搞斗“私”，内外一气，沟通思想，互相促进。
      （三）目的明确，重点突出。一期学习班着重解决一两个问题。当前，最大量、普遍的是以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，紧紧抓住革命大联合中存在的活思想，从政治思想上巩固和发展革命大联合。学习文件也坚持了少而精的原则，针对性很强。突出的是反复学习、认真领会毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，结合学习林彪副主席国庆讲话和其他有关文件。一般是学习五、六个文件。
      （四）以自我教育为主，自始至终贯彻自己教育自己，自己解放自己的原则。学习班坚持由群众自己提问题，自己讨论研究，自己解决问题。人人是学生，人人当教员。运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式解决问题。特别强调多做自我批评，自己揭自己的疮疤，自己革自己的命。群众性的讲用会、忆比会、控诉会都是群众自己教育自己的好方法。特别是抓典型，用样板引路，互相启发，共同提高，用典型推动一般，效果很好。
      （五）政治训练和军事训练相结合。很多学习班，在解放军同志帮助下，除了学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”等光辉著作，进行斗私批修以外，每天还进行半小时到一小时军事训练，把解放军的三八作风带到了学习班。学习班要求“思想革命化，组织军事化，行动战斗化”，增强了组织纪律性，使学习班既充满了严肃、紧张的学习空气，又呈现出生动活泼的局面。广大群众反映很好：既学了文又学了武，加强了党性和组织纪律性。学习班的这种好风气，很快传到了各单位去。（附图片）
