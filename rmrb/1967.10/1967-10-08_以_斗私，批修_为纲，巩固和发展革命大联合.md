The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, following the direction pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao, have mostly achieved initial revolutionary great alliances in most units. Currently, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance in thought is an urgent and important political task before us.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. "Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is the fundamental guideline of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This great guideline has timely pointed out the clear direction for us to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance.

The revolutionary great alliance was achieved through struggle and can only be consolidated and developed through struggle.

To consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance in thought, we must resolutely fight against selfishness and continue to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Selfishness and factionalism are quite stubborn and will not easily retreat from our minds. Under the impact of the great wave of revolutionary great alliances, some comrades' selfishness and factionalism may temporarily retreat. However, when they encounter a suitable climate and soil, they may reemerge and become obstacles to consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance. Therefore, in places where the revolutionary great alliance has been achieved, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat should continue to diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, under the guidance of the "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" guideline, and constantly fight against selfishness and touch their souls deeply. Revolutionary mass organizations should follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and, regarding their own shortcomings and errors, "conduct open, mass self-criticism (criticizing only oneself, not the other side) and thoroughly correct them." Doing so will not only greatly promote the consolidation and development of the revolutionary great alliance in thought but will also greatly promote our thought revolutionization.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great alliances. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great alliances under revolutionary principles."

A few comrades still do not understand Chairman Mao's great instructions and execute them half-heartedly and unseriously. They either cling to their own small factions, fearing to lose the position of "strong army and unique supremacy"; or they want to "devour" other revolutionary mass organizations; or they indirectly vie for positions and seats for personal and small-group interests. In short, they put selfishness first, failing to see the overall interests of the proletariat, and hesitate to unite. These comrades should quickly reflect. They must know that if they do not free themselves from the small world of selfishness, they will face the danger of falling behind.

To consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance in thought, we must resolutely criticize revisionism and continue unremittingly to fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their leader.

Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their leader, have been defeated. But if one thinks that uniting means "everything is fine" and "there is nothing to do," that is completely wrong.

In places where the revolutionary great alliance has been initially achieved, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat should continue to advance and launch a broader and deeper new wave of revolutionary great criticism, and combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units. We should understand that only in the great struggle of criticizing revisionism and criticizing the bourgeoisie, can we further unify our thoughts and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the unity of the revolutionary ranks, and consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance in thought.

We must never forget that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a handful of bad elements with ulterior motives will still distort and exploit revolutionary slogans to disrupt the revolutionary great alliance from the right or the ultra-"left." We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and never be complacent.

The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is our strongest ideological weapon in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and it is the soul of the revolutionary great alliance. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital and the broad revolutionary masses must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, in the revolutionary great criticism, combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, consolidate and develop the revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory!

### 以“斗私，批修”为纲，巩固和发展革命大联合

    以“斗私，批修”为纲，巩固和发展革命大联合
    首都广大无产阶级革命派，按照我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的航向，大多数单位已经初步实现了革命的大联合。当前，从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合，是摆在我们面前的一项迫切的重要政治任务。
    毛主席最近指示我们，要斗私，批修。“斗私，批修”，是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针。这个伟大的方针，及时地为我们指出了巩固和发展革命大联合的明确方向。
    革命的大联合是在斗争中实现的，也只有在斗争中才能得到巩固和发展。
    从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合，就必须狠斗“私”字，继续克服小资产阶级的派性。
    “私”字、派性，是相当顽固的，是不会那么轻易地从我们头脑中退走的。在声势浩大的革命大联合的浪潮冲击下，有些同志的“私”字、派性，可能暂时潜伏起来。但是，一遇到适当的气候，合适的土壤，它们还可能重新抬头，成为巩固和发展革命大联合的障碍。因此，在实现了革命大联合的那些地方，无产阶级革命派应当继续刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，在“斗私，批修”方针的指引下，不断地斗私，狠触自己的灵魂。革命群众组织应当遵循毛主席的伟大教导，对于自己的缺点错误，“实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之”。这样做，不仅能够大大促进我们从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合，而且将大大促进我们的思想革命化。
    毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合，只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”
    有极少数同志至今对毛主席的伟大指示很不理解，执行得很不得力，很不认真。他们或是对自己的小山头恋恋不舍，生怕失去“兵强马壮”、“唯我独尊”的地位；或是想“吃”掉其他革命群众组织；或是拐弯抹角地争名次、争席位，为个人和小团体争权。总之，他们“私”字当头，看不到无产阶级的全局利益，迟迟联合不起来。这些同志应该赶快猛省。必须知道，如果不从“私”字的小天地里解放出来，就大有掉队落伍的危险。
    从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合，就必须狠批修正主义，继续坚持不懈地同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已经被打得落花流水。但如果以为联合起来就“万事大吉”、“无事可做”了，那是十分错误的。
    凡是初步实现了革命大联合的地方，无产阶级革命派都应当继续前进，掀起一个更广泛、更深入的革命大批判的新高潮，并且把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来。我们应当懂得，只有在批判修正主义、批判资产阶级的伟大斗争中，进一步用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想，统一我们的行动，才能加强革命队伍的团结，从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合。
    我们千万不要忘记，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮别有用心的坏人，还会歪曲利用革命的口号，从右的方面或极“左”的方面来破坏革命的大联合。我们必须提高革命警惕，切切不可麻痹大意。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是我们斗私、批修的最强大的思想武器，是革命大联合的灵魂。首都无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在革命的大批判中，结合本单位的斗、批、改，巩固和发展革命的大联合，巩固和发展革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命胜利地进行到底！
                                              （十月七日）
