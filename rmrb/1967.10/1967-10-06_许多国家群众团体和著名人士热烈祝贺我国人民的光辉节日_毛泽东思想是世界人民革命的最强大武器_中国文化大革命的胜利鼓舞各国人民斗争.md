On the occasion of celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, mass organizations and famous figures from many countries have sent congratulatory telegrams and letters.

The chairman of the Albania-China Friendship Association, Abdul Kelizi, sent a telegram extending the warmest and most sincere congratulations to all the fraternal Chinese people. The telegram said that in this short historical period, the fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, have achieved brilliant successes in the fields of economy, science, and culture, transforming their formerly backward country into an advanced and powerful nation, a fortress of socialism and communism that is impregnable. The telegram pointed out that the great Chinese people, armed with the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, are successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary great alliance, which is developing and consolidating day by day, will surely smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, thereby defending Marxism-Leninism and making the People's Republic of China even more prosperous, achieving new and even greater victories, and opening up an even brighter future.

The chairman of the Albanian Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, Mishto Treska, said in his telegram that the great Chinese people, under the glorious leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the honorable Communist Party of China, have achieved tremendous successes. The Albanian people are infinitely happy about this. We are deeply convinced that under the radiance of Chairman Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought, the heroic revolutionary Chinese people will achieve greater and greater successes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and will forever march forward to victory on the road to socialism and communism, in the struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, against the modern revisionism headed by the Soviet Khrushchev clique, and against the reactionaries of all countries.

The chairman of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, Nguyen Quoc Hieu, said in his telegram that we Vietnamese people enthusiastically acclaim the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the fields of agriculture, industry, science and technology, and ideological culture over the past 18 years. We are deeply grateful for the great assistance given by the Chinese Party, government, and people to the cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation and against American aggression. On this occasion, we wish the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, even greater victories in the cause of socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The General Labor Union of South Vietnam, the Youth Liberation Union, the Student Liberation Union, the Women's Liberation Union, the Patriotic Democratic Association of Journalists, the South Vietnam Peace Committee, the South Vietnam Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, and other mass organizations have sent telegrams, enthusiastically praising the great achievements made by the Chinese people in all fields under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong over the past 18 years. They pointed out that these brilliant victories are a great encouragement to the struggle of the military and people of South Vietnam for national liberation and against American aggression. The telegrams of these organizations sincerely and wholeheartedly thank the Communist Party of China, the government, and the 700 million fraternal Chinese people for their sympathy, support, and great, precious, and effective assistance in all aspects to the current struggle of the 14 million people of South Vietnam for national liberation and against American aggression, and believe that this fighting unity and friendship is making an increasingly great contribution to the victory of the people of South Vietnam.

The secretary-general of the Indonesian Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, Ibrahim Isa, said in his letter of congratulations that all revolutionary peoples of the world are excitedly celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with a spirit of fighting unity. At this time, please allow us to express the feelings and thoughts of the Indonesian people who are fighting against the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution, and to extend our warmest congratulations to you, and through you to the great Chinese people, from the depths of our hearts.

The letter of congratulations said that celebrating the glorious founding of the People's Republic of China is first and foremost celebrating the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The founding of the People's Republic of China is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also a historic victory for the peoples of all countries in the world. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the victory of the Chinese revolution and the consolidation of the People's Republic of China prove the great truth of Chairman Mao's assertion that "without a revolutionary party, without a revolutionary party established according to the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

The letter of congratulations also pointed out that the long and extremely complex struggle waged by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the victories they have achieved one after another prove that Chairman Mao's assertion is a universal truth, that is, "the central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power by armed force, to solve problems by war." The practice of the Chinese revolution and the practice of the revolutions of other countries prove the great truth of Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist assertion about establishing rural revolutionary base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and seizing final victory. Chairman Mao's theory of people's war has become the only correct path for the oppressed peoples to achieve final victory.

The letter of congratulations said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made Mao Zedong Thought the beacon for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world. This is the greatest victory for the revolutionary peoples of the world. This is the greatest victory for Marxism-Leninism.

The letter of congratulations said that under the inspiration and further encouragement of the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Indonesian people led by the Communist Party of Indonesia, under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, will surely overcome all difficulties, persist in armed struggle, and carry the revolution through to the end, to overthrow the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution and achieve victory. Long live the fighting unity and friendship between Indonesia and the great Chinese people!

The letter of congratulations from the Italy-China Cultural Friendship Association said: On behalf of all Italian working people, we extend our warmest congratulations to you on your new great achievements in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism and in the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. The letter of congratulations said that the current situation is characterized by the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and personally led by Chairman Mao Zedong will ensure that China will not change color and has given us a universal lesson. In Italy, tens of thousands of workers also love Mao Zedong Thought, and we have achieved new successes in spreading and studying his works. Mao Zedong Thought is an indispensable and invincible weapon in the hands of revolutionaries all over the world. The Italian people will fully expose the revisionist traitors through the practical application of Mao Zedong Thought to the reality of our country, and carry out a thorough anti-imperialist struggle to the final victory. The letter of congratulations concluded by wishing the highest expression of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought—long live! Ten thousand times long live!

The chairman of the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), Kuroda Tsumio, sent a telegram saying that the unprecedented great feat of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao has developed victoriously, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, making them tremble with fear and panic. At the same time, it has greatly encouraged the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. The telegram wished for the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China to live long! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong! Ten thousand times long live! Ten thousand times ten thousand times long live!

Other countries' mass organizations and famous figures who sent congratulatory telegrams and letters include the Romanian Foreign Cultural Association, the Arab-China Friendship Association, the chairman of the East Pakistan-China Friendship Association, Mirza Wullam Hafiz, the chairman of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, the president of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, Purna Bahadur, the Mongolian-China Friendship Association, the former regent of Thailand, Piri Panon, Japanese figures such as Ishibashi Tanzan, Utsunomiya Tokuma, Kawase Ichikan, the Kansai branch of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Japanese figures such as Endo Saburo, the chairman of the Sudan-China Friendship Association, Abdul Wahab Zain Abdul, the chairman of the Belgian China Association, Robert Amédée, and the secretary-general, Madame Malde Husman, the Polish-China Friendship Association, the Cuban-China Friendship Association, and others.

    许多国家群众团体和著名人士热烈祝贺我国人民的光辉节日
    毛泽东思想是世界人民革命的最强大武器  中国文化大革命的胜利鼓舞各国人民斗争
    据新华社五日讯　在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的时候，许多国家的群众团体和著名人士发来贺电和贺信。
    阿尔巴尼亚—中国友好协会主席阿卜杜勒·凯莱齐在贺电中向全体兄弟的中国人民致以最热烈的、最衷心的祝贺。贺电说，在这短短的历史时期内，兄弟的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，在经济、科学和文化方面取得了辉煌的成就，并把过去落后的祖国建成了先进富强的国家，变成了社会主义和共产主义的坚不可摧的堡垒。贺电指出，用毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的思想武装起来的伟大中国人民正在胜利进行着无产阶级文化大革命。正在日益发展和巩固的革命大联合必将粉碎以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，从而为捍卫马克思列宁主义，并使中华人民共和国进一步繁荣，取得新的更加伟大的胜利，开辟更加光辉的远景。
    阿尔巴尼亚对外文化联络委员会主席米斯托·特雷斯卡在贺电中说，伟大的中国人民，在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的光辉领导下取得了巨大的成就，阿尔巴尼亚人民为此感到无限高兴。我们深信，在毛泽东主席的马克思列宁主义思想的光辉照耀下，英雄的革命的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中必将取得越来越大的成就，必将摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，必将在社会主义和共产主义的道路上，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义，反对以苏联赫鲁晓夫集团为首的现代修正主义，反对世界各国反动派的斗争中，永远胜利前进！
    越南中国友好协会会长黄国越在贺电中说，我们越南人民热烈欢呼中国人民十八年来在农业、工业、科学技术和文化思想等各方面所取得的巨大成就。我们无比感激中国党、政府和人民在各方面对越南人民的抗美救国斗争事业给予的巨大援助。趁此机会，祝中国人民在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设事业和无产阶级文化大革命中取得更多的巨大胜利。
    越南南方解放工会联合会、青年解放联合会、学生解放联合会、妇女解放联合会、爱国民主新闻工作者协会、越南南方和平委员会、越南南方亚非团结委员会等群众团体分别打电报，热烈歌颂中国人民十八年来在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的英明领导下，在各方面取得的伟大成就，并指出这些辉煌胜利是对越南南方军民抗美救国斗争的巨大鼓舞。这些团体的电报，真诚地、衷心地感谢中国共产党、政府和七亿兄弟的中国人民对一千四百万越南南方人民当前的抗美救国斗争的各方面的同情、支持和巨大、宝贵、有效的帮助，并认为这种战斗团结情谊为越南南方人民的胜利作出了日益巨大的贡献。

    贺信说，庆祝光荣的中华人民共和国的成立，首先是庆祝战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。中华人民共和国的成立不仅是中国人民的伟大胜利，而且是全世界各国人民的历史性的胜利。在毛主席的英明领导下，中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的巩固证明毛主席的论断的伟大真理，即“没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    贺信还指出，中国人民在中国共产党领导下所进行的长期而且极其复杂的斗争及其所取得的一个又一个的胜利，证明毛主席的论断是普遍真理，即“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”中国革命的实践和其他国家革命的实践，证明毛主席关于建立农村革命根据地、农村包围城市和夺取最后胜利的马克思列宁主义论断的伟大真理。毛主席的人民战争的理论已经成为被压迫人民争取最后胜利的唯一正确的道路。
    贺信说，无产阶级文化大革命使毛泽东思想成为世界各国人民革命斗争的指路明灯。这是全世界革命人民最伟大的胜利。这是马克思列宁主义最伟大的胜利。
    贺信说，印度尼西亚共产党领导下的印度尼西亚人民，在中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利的鼓励和进一步的鼓舞下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，必将克服一切困难，坚持武装斗争，把革命进行到底，以推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权，直至取得胜利。印度尼西亚和伟大的中国人民之间的战斗团结和友谊万岁！
    意中文化友好关系协会发来的贺电说：我们以全体意大利劳动人民的名义，向你们致以最热忱的祝贺，祝贺你们在反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争中，在活学活用毛泽东思想方面取得的新的伟大成就。贺电说，当前局势的特点就是东风压倒西风。毛泽东主席主张的并亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，将使中国不再改变颜色，并且给了我们一个普遍性的教益。在意大利，成千上万的劳动者也热爱毛泽东思想，我们在传播和学习他的著作方面取得了新的成就。毛泽东思想是全世界革命者手中的不可缺少和不可战胜的武器。意大利人民通过针对我国现实活用毛泽东思想，将会全面地揭露修正主义叛徒，并进行彻底的反帝斗争，直到最后胜利。贺电最后祝当代马克思列宁主义的最高表现——战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万万岁！
    日中友好协会（正统）总部会长黑田寿男发来的电报说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的壮举——无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，给美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派以沉重的打击，使它们心惊胆战，恐慌万状。同时，给予英雄的越南人民，亚非拉和全世界人民的斗争以极大的鼓舞。电报祝日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！祝伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
