The Albanian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is a great and precious gift from the fraternal Chinese people. This was the headline of a lengthy editorial published in the Albanian newspaper "The Voice of the People" on October 8.

New China News Agency, Tirana, October 12 — The Albanian newspaper "The Voice of the People" published an editorial on October 8 titled "The Albanian Version of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is a Great and Precious Gift from the Fraternal Chinese People," enthusiastically hailing the publication of the Albanian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The full text of the editorial is as follows:

	It has been reported that the Albanian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was recently published in Beijing. This is a precious gift of great value and significance from the fraternal Chinese people to our party and our people. It is another manifestation of the combat alliance and fraternal internationalist friendship that exists between our two countries, our two peoples, and our two Marxist-Leninist parties.

	"The Quotations from Chairman Mao" is a collection of the essence of Mao Zedong's works, which expound, argue, and defend Marxist-Leninist theories on the Communist Party, class and class struggle, revolution and proletarian dictatorship, socialism and communism, contradictions between the enemy and us and within the people, war and peace, the mass line, patriotism and internationalism, self-reliance, unity, discipline, criticism and self-criticism, cadres, culture and art, theory and practice, and more. Based on the experiences of China and the international communist movement, Comrade Mao Zedong has put forward a series of viewpoints that further enrich Marxist-Leninist theory. This book, along with the collection of works by Comrade Mao Zedong published in Albanian a few years ago, will help to educate cadres and the masses in Marxism and to acquaint them with the long and glorious experiences of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chinese revolution.

	The Albanian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" begins with a telegram from Comrade Mao Zedong to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor. The telegram states: "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe... Please believe, comrades, that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and our two peoples will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together."

	Comrade Mao Zedong's heartfelt words, his lofty evaluation of our country's great historical role in Europe, and his expression of the deep and unshakable friendship that binds our two parties and our two peoples have been engraved in the minds and hearts of every Albanian. The Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" will become a symbol of the indestructible friendship between our two parties and our two peoples. Every Albanian who receives this book will recall the words of our country's people and our party's leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Comrade Hoxha has said: "The fraternal, rock-solid friendship between our Party, our government, and our people with the Communist Party of China, the government of China, and the people of China will last forever. Neither distance nor mountains and seas can stop us. In good times and in difficult times, we will always be together like brothers. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the People's Republic of China has followed the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong, further developing Marxism-Leninism under the current domestic and international conditions, using them as a guiding light. It has become a great example for the peoples of all countries and all revolutionary forces in thought, politics, economics, and all aspects both domestically and internationally."

	The Albanian version of Comrade Mao Zedong's quotations was published during the visit of the Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to the People's Republic of China. This visit will elevate our friendship to new and higher heights and further strengthen the love of our people for Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the great Chinese people.

	The Albanian Party of Labor led by Comrade Hoxha and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong are new-type revolutionary parties of the working class; they are fraternal parties. The peoples of Albania and China are fraternal peoples, inseparable comrades-in-arms on the road to socialism and communism. The People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China are the shock troops of the world revolution. In the ideological, political, and organizational foundations of our two parties, in the worldviews and spirits of our two peoples, in all revolutionary activities of our two countries, and in the friendship and combat cooperation between them, there exists the invincible and immortal Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

	Chairman Mao Zedong is the great leader of the glorious Communist Party of China and the heroic 700 million Chinese people, the successor of the cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the great friend of all freedom-loving peoples of the world, and the most esteemed friend of our party and our people. Under the direct, reliable, and far-sighted leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have waged a long and heroic revolutionary struggle, establishing the People's Republic of China on the ruins of semi-colonial China, transforming it into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern defense, and becoming an impregnable bastion of world socialism.

	Under the direct, reliable, and far-sighted leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been launched and is proceeding victoriously. This great revolution has achieved brilliant victories in the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The Red Guards and hundreds of millions of broad masses of laboring people of China, holding the Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and armed with Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thoughts, have risen up in unison, thoroughly exposing, denouncing, and isolating the Chinese revisionists headed by China's Khrushchev, completely destroying their traitorous strongholds, and smashing their counter-revolutionary lines in all respects. Thus, they have foiled the plans and hopes of the internal enemies, the imperialists headed by the United States, and the modern revisionists headed by the Soviet revisionists to seize the fortress from within, overthrow the proletarian dictatorship, and restore capitalism in China. The revolutionary masses, guided by the Marxist-Leninist teachings of Chairman Mao, have seized power and are realizing the great alliance of the revolution, vigorously advancing production. This is a victory of great domestic and international historical significance for the Chinese people and all revolutionaries and for the international communist movement and the workers' movement. It is a great example for the Marxist-Leninists and the laboring masses in countries where the revisionists are in power to overthrow and eliminate these traitors. The historic victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new proof of the correctness and power of Comrade Mao Zedong's invincible Marxist-Leninist thought.

	Our laborers, having learned the quotations and works of Chairman Mao, have also learned the revolutionary road of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, his great teachings and thoughts, and clearly seen that he has always defended and carried out the doctrine of the world proletariat—Marxism-Leninism—under the conditions of China, summarizing the great experiences of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese proletariat, and the Chinese people in revolution, in socialist construction and in defending the victories of the revolution, in the international struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and in the political and ideological struggles for the cause of socialism, the freedom of the peoples of all countries, and world peace.

	The first section of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "The Communist Party," includes quotations on the importance, role, and tasks of the working-class party. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the working class, as the leader of the revolution, can only accomplish the historic mission of overthrowing capitalism and building a socialist and communist society under the leadership of its revolutionary party. This party must be guided by revolutionary theory, always defend the cause of communism, and organize, educate, and lead the working class and the laboring masses in the revolution. This is one of the fundamental principles of our doctrine that cannot be changed, and it refutes the revisionists' false revolutionary slogans such as "the party of the whole people," etc. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his opening address at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China in 1954: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism."

	Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have handed down to the proletariat and its revolutionary parties the powerful theoretical weapon of class and class struggle, and they regard this struggle as the motive force of human social development. Comrade Mao Zedong has refuted the opportunists' illusions of "class peace" and once again proven the correctness of the Marxist theory on this fundamental issue. Comrade Mao Zedong said:

		"Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization. To explain history from this point of view is called historical materialism, and to stand on the opposite side of this point of view is historical idealism." He also said: "After our socialist revolution has basically won, there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They will fight against the working class from all sides, including the ideological side. And in this struggle, the revisionists are their best helpers."

	In the section "Socialism and Communism," Comrade Mao Zedong, after expounding the basic ideas of the ideological system of this new society, argues for the necessity of strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship and refutes the opportunists by saying:

		"You want to abolish state power, don't you?" We do, but we don't want it now, we can't want it now. Why? Because imperialism still exists, domestic reactionaries still exist, domestic classes still exist. Our current task is to strengthen the state machine of the people, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to consolidate national defense and protect the interests of the people." In refuting Khrushchev's pseudo-communism, he put forward the following points: "Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state, and they are the reliable guarantees for communists to avoid bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism, and stand unshakable, and for the proletariat to unite with the broad masses of laboring people and implement democratic dictatorship."

	Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist teachings on the two types of contradictions "between the enemy and us and within the people," on closely linking with the masses, listening to the masses' opinions and relying on the masses, on cadres, on participating in productive labor, opposing bureaucratism, and preventing revisionism, on strengthening the army's ties with the people, on organizing the masses, etc., are of great significance for winning the revolution and continuously strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. When talking about the methods of handling contradictions within the people, he emphasized the formula of "unity—criticism—unity."

	Regarding the issues of war and peace, and regarding the attitude towards imperialist aggression and the aggression of all enemies, these issues occupy a very important position in the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. He has said on these issues:

		"All reactionaries are paper tigers. They may look ferocious, but in reality, they have no power at all. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." He also said: "In order to fight against the enemy, we have formed a concept over a long period of time, that is, in strategy, we must despise all enemies, and in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously." From this, his battle cry of "daring to fight, daring to win" was produced.

	Closely related to this is Comrade Mao Zedong's proposition on the relationship between politics and economics, weapons, and the proposition of emphasizing politics. He said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." He also said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic strength but also a comparison of manpower and morale."

	"Quotations from Chairman Mao" concludes with the section "Study," which states: "The theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are theories that are universally applicable... Not only should one understand the conclusions about general laws drawn by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin from their extensive study of real life and revolutionary experience, but one should also learn their stance and methods of observing and solving problems."

	"Quotations from Chairman Mao" is a reflection of the Communist Party of China's unshakable loyalty to Marxism-Leninism. It is completely based on the universal and unshakable principles of this great revolutionary theory. It is a reflection of the creative application of this great revolutionary theory in practice under the conditions of the People's Republic of China, in the current stage of the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the traitorous leadership of the CPSU. Such a book as "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is a book of great theoretical value. All revolutionaries can and should learn a lot from this book, and our party members and laboring masses are no exception. Revolutionaries who firmly stand on the Marxist-Leninist position and all fraternal parties must learn and should constantly learn from each other's experiences, practices, and theoretical summaries. This has been and is a teaching of great significance for our party. This is why our party members and laboring people, who are studying the theoretical wealth of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the great experiences and historic documents of our party, and the teachings of Comrade Hoxha, should study "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with great enthusiasm and attention, just as they study other works of Comrade Mao Zedong. This will help to further temper the fraternal, combative friendship and ties between our two parties and our two peoples.

　　阿尔巴尼亚文版的《毛主席语录》是兄弟中国人民的伟大和宝贵的礼物
　　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十月八日社论
    新华社地拉那十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》八日发表题为《阿尔巴尼亚文版的〈毛主席语录〉是兄弟中国人民的伟大和宝贵的礼物》的长篇社论，热烈欢呼阿尔巴尼亚文版《毛主席语录》的出版。社论全文如下：
    前已报道，阿文版的《毛主席语录》几天前在北京出版。这是兄弟的中国人民给予我党和我国人民的具有巨大价值和重大意义的珍贵礼物。它是存在于我们两国、两国人民和我们两个马克思列宁主义党之间的战斗联系和兄弟般的国际主义友谊的又一表现。
    《毛主席语录》这本书是毛主席著作的精华，其中提出、论证和捍卫了马克思列宁主义关于共产党、阶级和阶级斗争、革命和无产阶级专政、社会主义和共产主义、敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾、战争与和平、群众路线、爱国主义和国际主义、自力更生、团结、纪律、批评和自我批评、干部、文化和艺术、理论和实践等理论。在中国和国际共产主义运动经验的基础上，毛泽东同志提出了一系列进一步丰富了马克思列宁主义理论的论点。这本书以及几年前用阿文出版的毛泽东同志著作的选集，有助于对干部和群众进行马克思主义的教育和使他们了解毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，了解中国共产党和伟大的中国革命的长期和光荣的经验。
    阿文版的《毛主席语录》正文前是毛泽东同志致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电。贺电说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。……请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
　　毛泽东同志的这番热情洋溢的话，他对我国在欧洲的伟大历史作用所做的崇高评价，以及对联结我们两党和两国人民的无限忠诚的深厚友谊所做出的表示，已经铭刻在每一个阿尔巴尼亚人的思想和心灵中。红书《毛主席语录》将成为永远联结我们两党和两国人民的牢不可破的友谊的象征。将得到这本书的每个阿尔巴尼亚人，都会回忆起我国人民和我们党的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志所说的话。霍查同志说过：“我们党、我国政府和我国人民同中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民结成的兄弟般的、坚如磐石的友谊，将万古长青。不管是迢迢万里，还是高山和海洋，都阻挡不住我们。不管在美好的日子里还是困难的日子里，我们将象亲兄弟一样永远在一起。由于光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导，中华人民共和国遵循马克思列宁主义学说和毛泽东的教导——它在当前的国内和国际条件下进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，把它们作为指路明灯，已经在思想、政治、经济，在国内外所有方面，成为各国人民和所有革命力量的伟大榜样。”
    阿文版的毛泽东同志的语录，是由谢胡同志率领的我国党政代表团正在中华人民共和国进行访问的时候出版的。这次访问将把我们的友谊推向新的更高的高峰，进一步加强我国人民对毛泽东同志、中国共产党和伟大的中国人民的热爱。
    以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，是新型的工人阶级的革命党；它们是兄弟党。阿中两国人民是兄弟的人民，是在社会主义和共产主义道路上不可分离的战友。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国是世界革命的突击队。在我们两党的思想、政治和组织基础当中，在我们两国人民的世界观和精神当中，在我们两国的所有革命活动以及在他们之间的友谊和战斗合作当中，存在着战无不胜的和不朽的马克思列宁主义学说。
    毛泽东主席是光荣的中国共产党和英雄的七亿中国人民的伟大领袖，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林事业的继承者，是全世界所有爱好自由人民的伟大朋友，是我们党和我国人民最尊贵的朋友。在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，中国人民进行了长期的英勇革命斗争，在半殖民地中国的废墟上建立了中华人民共和国，使她成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化国防的强大的社会主义国家，成为世界社会主义的坚不可摧的堡垒。
    在毛泽东主席的直接、可靠和卓有远见的领导下，发动了并正在胜利地进行着无产阶级文化大革命。这场大革命在反对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中取得了辉煌的胜利。中国的红卫兵和亿万广大劳动人民群众手持红书《毛主席语录》，心中具有毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，一致奋起，彻底揭露、揭发和孤立了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的中国修正主义者，从根本上摧毁了他们的叛徒阵地，并在各个方面打烂了他们的反革命阵线，从而粉碎了内部敌人、以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修为首的现代修正主义者妄图从内部夺取堡垒，推翻无产阶级专政，在中国复辟资本主义的计划和希望。无产阶级革命派根据毛泽东主席的马克思列宁主义教导，把政权掌握在自己手里，正在实现革命的大联合，蓬蓬勃勃地推进生产。对于中国人民以及全世界所有革命者和国际共产主义运动与工人运动来说，这是具有重要的国内和国际历史意义的胜利。特别对于修正主义者当权的国家的马克思列宁主义者和劳动人民群众推翻和消灭这些叛徒来说，这是一个伟大的榜样。无产阶级文化大革命的历史性胜利，是毛泽东同志的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想的正确性和力量的新的证明。
    我国的劳动者了解了毛主席的语录和著作，也就了解了中国共产党和中国人民的革命道路，也就了解了他的伟大的教导和思想，从中清楚地看出他在中国的条件下，始终不渝地捍卫和贯彻世界无产阶级的学说——马克思列宁主义，概括了中国共产党、中国无产阶级和中国人民在革命、在社会主义建设和保卫革命的胜利果实，在国际范围内反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，在争取社会主义事业、各国人民的自由和世界和平的政治和思想斗争中的伟大经验。
    《毛主席语录》的第一节“共产党”中，采用了关于工人阶级政党的重要性、作用和任务的语录。马克思列宁主义教导我们，工人阶级作为革命的领导，只有在其革命党的领导下，才能完成推翻资本主义和建设社会主义与共产主义社会的历史使命，这个党要以革命理论作为指导，始终捍卫共产主义事业，在革命中组织、教育和领导工人阶级和劳动人民群众。这是我们的学说的不能改变的基本原则之一，它驳斥了修正主义者关于“全民党”等等假革命论调。因此，毛泽东同志在一九五四年中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕词中说：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林把阶级和阶级斗争的强大理论武器传给了无产阶级及其革命政党，并把这种斗争看作是人类社会发展的动力。毛泽东同志回击了机会主义分子关于“阶级和平”的幻想，再次证明了马克思主义关于这一根本问题的理论的正确性。毛泽东同志说：
      “阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。”他又说：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。而在这个斗争中，修正主义者就是他们最好的助手。”
    在语录的“社会主义和共产主义”一节中，毛泽东同志在阐明了关于这一新社会的思想体系的基本思想后，论证了加强人民民主专政的必要性，并驳斥机会主义者说：
    “‘你们不是要消灭国家权力吗？’我们要，但是我们现在还不要，我们现在还不能要。为什么？帝国主义还存在，国内反动派还存在，国内阶级还存在。我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要地是指人民的军队、人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以巩固国防和保护人民利益。”他在驳斥赫鲁晓夫假共产主义时，提出了以下论点：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动，是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证。”
    毛主席关于两类矛盾“敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾”，关于密切联系群众、倾听群众意见和依靠群众，关于干部，提出干部参加生产劳动、反对官僚主义和防止修正主义的思想，关于加强军队同人民的联系，关于组织群众等马克思列宁主义教导，对于争取革命胜利和不断加强无产阶级专政具有重大的意义。在谈到处理人民内部矛盾的方法时，他强调指出了“团结——批评——团结”的公式。
      关于战争与和平问题，关于对待帝国主义侵略和一切敌人的侵略问题，在毛泽东同志的著作中占有十分重要的地位。他就这些问题曾经说过：
      “一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”他又说：“为了同敌人作斗争，我们在一个长时间内形成了一个概念，就是说，在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”从这一点出发，产生了他的“敢于战斗，敢于胜利”的战斗号召。
    与此紧密相联系的是，毛泽东同志提出了政治同经济、武器之间的关系问题，提出了突出政治。他说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”他又说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”
    《毛主席语录》以“学习”一节为结束，里面写道：“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，是‘放之四海而皆准’的理论。……不但应当了解马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林他们研究广泛的真实生活和革命经验所得出的关于一般规律的结论，而且应当学习他们观察问题和解决问题的立场和方法。”
      《毛主席语录》是中国共产党对马克思列宁主义无限忠诚的反映，它是完全建立在这一伟大革命理论的普遍的和不可动摇的原则基础上的。它是在中华人民共和国的条件下，在反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义和以苏共领导叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争的现阶段的条件下，在实践中创造性地运用这一伟大的革命理论的反映。《毛主席语录》这样的书，是一本具有伟大理论价值的书，所有革命者都可以而且应当从这本书中学习到很多东西，我国共产党员和劳动群众也不例外。坚决站在马克思列宁主义立场上的革命者和一切兄弟党，要学习并且应该不断地学习相互的经验、实践和理论总结。这在过去和现在都是我们党的具有巨大意义的教导。这就是为什么从事学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论财富，学习我党的伟大经验和历史性文件以及霍查同志的教导的我国共产党人和劳动群众，要以巨大的热情和注意力，象学习毛泽东同志的其他著作一样来学习《毛主席语录》。这将有助于进一步锤炼我们两党和两国人民之间的兄弟般的、战斗的友谊和联系。
