The Beijing Garrison Command holds a Mao Zedong Thought study class to unify the thoughts of revolutionary youngsters and promote their unity.

The Beijing Garrison Command has held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various districts, focusing on the principle of "criticizing oneself and opposing revisionism." They have concentrated on training 1,729 leaders from revolutionary mass organizations in 329 secondary schools. The participating Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students have seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and the great leader's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary unity. They have recognized the current good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, heightened their awareness of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, broken down petty-bourgeois factionalism, and established proletarian party spirit. This has effectively promoted the revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination" in Beijing's secondary schools, laying a solid foundation for further carrying out revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own schools.

Practice has proven that using the study class method to organize Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students to sit down and study Chairman Mao's works, criticize themselves and oppose revisionism, and conduct open and sincere self-criticism, allowing the masses to educate themselves, is an effective way to fundamentally raise the masses' ideological awareness and correctly handle contradictions among the people. Such study classes also serve to concentrate time, energy, key personnel, and solve major problems.

The first point of experience from the study class is: to criticize oneself and oppose revisionism, one must seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take Mao Zedong Thought as the soul, start from analyzing the situation and clarifying tasks, and emphasize using Mao Zedong Thought to raise the ideological and political awareness of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students, and to unify the thoughts of revolutionary youngsters.

Since April of this year, the revolutionary mass organizations in various secondary schools in Beijing have split into the so-called "April 3rd faction" and "April 4th faction." In some schools, the two factions have been in long-term opposition, fighting "internal wars," seriously affecting the overall direction of the struggle. At the beginning of the training, the atmosphere was tense. Some brought big-character posters, debate outlines, and leaflets, ready to "settle scores" and "have a big fight." Others saw this as an opportunity to expand their influence and "strengthen their forces." Some were unwilling to participate, thinking it was a "reflective" style of study. Others were wary of participating, fearing they would be "outmaneuvered" and lose their "base," and their forces would be disbanded. In short, many thought that achieving great unity in middle schools was "inappropriate," and that great unity would blur the struggle between the two lines. The PLA comrades leading the study class did not rush to solve these specific problems but first organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Rectifying Wrong Ideas in the Party," and repeatedly study the great leader's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles." The PLA also organized everyone to seriously study the important speeches of central responsible comrades on September 1st and 5th. The focus of the study was to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought and the voice of Chairman Mao's headquarters to solve the main problems in middle schools.

Practice has proven: Chairman Mao's words are the highest in level and the greatest in power, every sentence is truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand. The speeches of central responsible comrades are the latest battle orders issued by the Party Central Committee. After sitting down to study and repeated discussions, many Red Guards realized: "The past mistakes were because we looked more at the minor trends, less at the main trends, read more small newspapers, less big newspapers, listened more to street news and rumors, and less to the central's words. 'Ten thousand mistakes, a hundred thousand mistakes, the mistake is not following Chairman Mao's teachings to analyze the situation.'" After studying, Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the hearts of the revolutionary youngsters. Everyone's eyes were opened, they saw farther, and clearly recognized the good situation of the Cultural Revolution and the tasks of the struggle. Everyone's unanimous conclusion was: among ten thousand reasons and a hundred thousand reasons, achieving good revolutionary great unity and criticism is the greatest reason.

The second point of experience from the study class is: to criticize oneself and oppose revisionism, one must dare to link it to reality, and use Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely combat factionalism and raise party spirit. Leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations conducted sincere self-criticism, and under the direction of criticizing revisionism, they united.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution." Many revolutionary youngsters in middle schools, after studying this quote from Chairman Mao, deeply realized that without criticizing oneself, the Cultural Revolution could not be carried through to the end. In more than a year of Cultural Revolution, they often only saw themselves as the driving force of the revolution, but did not also see themselves as the object of the revolution. Now they are determined to sit down and seriously study a few of Chairman Mao's works, following Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone strictly examined themselves, identified problems, exposed their private thoughts, criticized their erroneous thoughts, and dug out the class roots of their errors. Many Red Guards spoke at length about the harm of factionalism. At the same time, through the study, they further recognized that the contradictions between the two factions were purely internal contradictions among the people. Both sides clearly understood the nature of the contradictions and had the desire to unite. The PLA then helped them analyze the reasons for the opposition between the two factions. They found two reasons: first, petty-bourgeois factionalism was higher than proletarian party spirit, each thinking they were the most leftist and revolutionary; second, they criticized others more and themselves less. They unanimously agreed: only by conducting more self-criticism could suspicions be removed, guards be lowered, and hearts be connected, thoroughly eliminating factionalism and "mountaintops" in thoughts. For example, a Red Guard leader from the 39th Middle School deeply examined: due to factionalism, the analysis of the situation was often shortsighted; the strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and the overall direction of the struggle were not clear, thinking less about the major class struggles in the world and the country, but more about the struggles of their own small groups and factions. Due to factionalism, when handling problems, they often thought of what their faction was urgent about and what their faction thought about, rather than what the Party Central Committee was urgent about and what Chairman Mao thought about. Due to factionalism, they could not correctly use the powerful weapon of criticism and self-criticism. They exaggerated others' criticisms as "limitless" while lightly brushing off their own errors, or not conducting serious self-criticism at all. Due to factionalism, they could not faithfully execute Chairman Mao's highest instructions and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

With the help of the PLA, the study class saw many moving scenes. Originally, in a school or even a class, students who had been in long-term opposition due to the "April 3rd faction" and "April 4th faction" were now studying Chairman Mao's works together as a "red pair." Originally, those who attacked and insulted each other, or even fought, were now sitting on the same bench, talking heart to heart, and mutually criticizing. Everyone promised to Chairman Mao: "Not to be the 'April 3rd faction' or the 'April 4th faction,' but to be Chairman Mao's revolutionary faction!" The study class summarized the change among revolutionary youngsters, starting from "back to back," then "face to face," and finally "shoulder to shoulder" fighting together!

The third point of experience from the study class is: to praise advanced examples, grasp active factors, and quickly promote revolutionary great unity.

The study class's third point of experience is: to praise advanced examples, grasp active factors, and use advanced examples for living education. The leaders of the two factions in the affiliated middle school of the Nationalities College had been leading their respective teams for half a year, each trying to overthrow the other. They used magnifying glasses to find each other's flaws and microscopes to find each other's errors, each occupying their own "mountaintop," attacking each other, and fighting "internal wars" for several months. The result was a serious setback for the proletarian Cultural Revolution in the school. Great unity could not be achieved, great criticism could not be carried out, and the "three-in-one combination" could not be formed. The enemy and friend lines were blurred, and energy was scattered. The two faction leaders, in the training class's experience-sharing meeting, seriously and revolutionarily conducted public self-criticism. Their criticism had a significant impact on the training class, generally considered to be a soul-searching examination. The PLA instructors immediately praised their daring spirit of self-criticism and self-revolution, and called on the trainees to learn from them. Many comrades, unwilling to fall behind, conducted self-criticism one after another. The leaders of the two factions in the 35th Middle School had an even higher style; they laid bare all the so-called internal secrets of mutual attacks and sabotage between the two factions in the training class's experience-sharing meeting. A student from the "April 3rd faction," He Renliang, had an awakening of his thoughts but did not fully expose the ugliest and most painful things. When he heard Liu Sheng from the "April 4th faction" "expose his bottom," he felt that he "exposed sincerely, and it was comfortable to listen." Thus, he went up to the stage for a second time to expose his thoughts. Liu Sheng was even more moved, saying, "We are from the same school and grade, originally in the same combat team fighting together for eight months, later because of differing views, we split into two halves and fought 'internal wars' for half a year. Who would have thought that in the training class we would join hands again? This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of breaking private and establishing public. 'Half a year of not seeing thoughts, today's heart-to-heart is especially intimate,' they reunited under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Their unity had a chain reaction in the training class. Schools with serious opposition emotions, such as the First Girls' Middle School and the Third Girls' Middle School, solved their problems one by one. The PLA fully used these living examples to educate everyone and, riding the wind of national revolutionary great unity, guided and promoted the revolutionary great unity in middle schools.

The study class was held in mid-September. At that time, a high tide of great unity swept the country. On September 20th, they listened to the report of a central responsible comrade on achieving revolutionary great unity to welcome National Day. That night, they rushed back to school to convey and discuss the report. Because it was late, most students had already gone home. They went to find them one by one and held meetings all night to discuss and achieve great unity. Many schools fought through the night. On the 21st and 22nd, a high tide of revolutionary great unity in secondary schools surged. Now, 99% of the secondary schools in the city have united, and 176 secondary schools have achieved revolutionary "three-in-one combination," establishing revolutionary committees.

The fourth point of experience from the study class is: to combine internal and external efforts, communicate thoughts, and promote the ideological revolution of the broad masses of teachers and students.

The study class's fourth point of experience is: to combine the training of Red Guard leaders with mobilizing the masses organically, not to close the door for training, but to create a lively and vibrant situation where leaders lead the masses, the masses urge the leaders, and they mutually encourage and promote each other to improve together. In the early days of the training class, it was found that many leaders had concerns, thinking that it was not enough to just raise their class awareness, but also to do ideological and political work for the broad revolutionary teachers and students. For example, the leaders of the "Lu Xun Corps" in the Sixth Girls' Middle School realized the serious harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism and had a strong desire for great unity. However, when they returned to school and discussed with their comrades, some said she was "betraying comrades," "betraying the organization," and "leaking organizational secrets." The PLA instructors, understanding this situation, deeply felt that "grasping a few, losing the majority" and closing the door to conduct training classes in isolation was not feasible. Internal and external efforts needed to be combined to expand the scope of education. On the one hand, the training of Red Guard leaders should be done well, and on the other hand, the education of the broad revolutionary teachers and students in school should not be relaxed. To combine internal and external efforts and promote each other, the training class held experience-sharing meetings or advanced example report meetings, organizing more people from the school to participate. At the same time, Red Guard leaders were concentrated during the day to study, and at night, they were given appropriate time to return to school to report their study situation to all their comrades, communicate internal and external thoughts, and understand each other's situations. The training class discussed the situation, unity, and criticism; the broad revolutionary teachers and students in the school also discussed the situation, unity, and criticism, internally and externally united, mutually promoting, and improving together.

The revolutionary teachers and students who participated in the study unanimously agreed: such a training class is "very good," and there is a "big difference" between training and not training. Everyone unanimously praised: the training class is a "great school of Mao Zedong Thought" and a "good classroom for criticizing oneself and opposing revisionism," and all hoped that such training classes would continue. Now, the second session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the various joint commands under the Beijing Garrison Command has begun. In addition to the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations participating, study classes for cadres and teachers are also held separately.

　　北京卫戍区军训指挥部举办毛泽东思想学习班
　　统一革命小将的思想
　　促进革命小将的团结
    三百二十九所中等学校的一千七百二十九名革命群众组织负责人经过活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，大破小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性，有力地促进了北京中等学校的革命大联合和“三结合”。
    本报讯　北京卫戍区军训指挥部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，分区举办毛泽东思想学习班，集中训练北京三百二十九所中等学校的革命群众组织负责人一千七百二十九名。参加学习的红卫兵小将和革命师生认真活学活用毛主席著作和伟大领袖关于实现革命大联合的最新指示，认清了当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，提高了紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的自觉性，大破小资产阶级的派性，大立无产阶级的党性，有力地促进了北京中等学校革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，为进一步开展革命的大批判和本校的斗批改打下有力的基础。
    实践证明，采用学习班的方法，组织红卫兵小将和革命师生坐下来活学活用毛主席著作，“斗私，批修”，各自进行公开的认真的自我批评，让群众自己教育自己，是从根本上提高群众思想觉悟、正确处理人民内部矛盾的好形式。这种学习班，也起到了集中时间、集中精力、集中主要人员、集中地解决主要问题的作用。
    千条理，万条理，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署是最大的道理
    学习班的第一点体会是：斗私，批修，必须认真学习毛主席的最新指示，以毛泽东思想为灵魂，从分析形势和明确任务着手，突出用毛泽东思想来提高红卫兵小将和革命师生的思想政治觉悟，突出用伟大的毛泽东思想去统一革命小将的思想。
    北京市各中等学校的革命群众组织，自今年四月份以来，分成了所谓“四·三派”和“四·四派”。在一些学校里两派长期对立，互打“内战”，严重影响了斗争的大方向。集训一开始，两方面“火药味”很浓。有的带着大字报、辩论提纲、传单，准备到集训班来
  “见个高低，大干一场”。有的认为这是串连的大好机会，到此扩大自己一派影响，“扩充实力”。有的不愿参加集训，认为这是“闭门思过”式的学习。还有的对参加集训不放心，怕被“抄后路”，失去“根据地”，队伍被瓦解等。总之，不少人认为中学搞大联合“不合时宜”，搞大联合就是抹煞两条路线的斗争。领导学习班的解放军同志不先忙于解决这些具体问题，而是首先组织大家认真学习毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，反复学习伟大领袖关于实现革命大联合的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”解放军还组织大家认真学习中央负责同志九月一日、九月五日的重要讲话。学习的重点就是突出毛泽东思想、突出毛主席司令部的声音，去解决中学存在的主要问题。
    实践证明：毛主席的话水平最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。中央负责同志的讲话是党中央发出的最新的战斗号令。经过坐下来学习和反复的讨论，不少红卫兵小将认识到：过去的错误是因为“看支流多，看主流少，看小报多，看大报少，听马路新闻、小道消息多，听中央的话少”。“千错、万错，错在没有按照毛主席的教导去分析形势。”经过学习，毛泽东思想照亮了革命小将的心胸。大家眼睛亮了，看得远了，明确认识了文化大革命的大好形势，明确了斗争的任务。大家一致的结论是：千条理、万条理，搞好革命大联合、大批判是最大的道理。
    不当“四·三派”，不当“四·四派”，要当毛泽东思想革命派
    学习班的第二点体会是：斗私，批修，要敢于联系实际，灵魂中刺刀见红，用毛泽东思想狠斗派性，提高党性。各革命群众组织负责人双方各作认真的自我批评，在批修的大方向下团结起来。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”。许多中学的革命小将学习了毛主席这一语录，深深认识到不斗私，文化大革命就不能进行到底。一年多的文化大革命中，他们常常只把自己当作革命的动力，而没有同时也把自己当作革命的对象。现在决心坐下来，扎扎实实学几篇毛主席著作，按照毛主席的教导，大家严格对照检查自己，摆问题，亮私心，批判自己的错误思想，挖错误的阶级根源。许多红卫兵小将大讲派性的危害性。同时，在学习中，进一步认识了两派之间的矛盾，完全是人民内部问题。双方明确了矛盾的性质，都有了团结的愿望，于是解放军又帮助他们分析两派对立的原因。他们找出了两个原因：一是小资产阶级的派性高于无产阶级的党性，唯我独“左”，唯我独革；二是批评对方多，批评自己少。一致认为：只有多做自我批评，才能排除疑心，打掉戒心，作到心连心，把思想上的派性和“山头”彻底铲除掉。如三十九中的一名红卫兵负责人深刻检查：由于派性作怪，对形势的分析常常鼠目寸光；对毛主席的战略部署、斗争的大方向看不清楚，对全世界、全国的阶级斗争的大事想得少了，对自己小团体、小派别的斗争却看得很重。由于派性作怪，处理问题时常常是“急本派所急，想本派所想”，而不是急党中央所急，想毛主席所想。由于派性作怪，不能正确运用批评和自我批评这一有力武器。对别人的批评是“无限上纲”，对自己的错误则轻轻带过，甚至根本不作认真的自我批评。由于派性作怪，就不能忠实执行毛主席的最高指示，不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    在解放军帮助下，学习班出现了许多动人的情景。原来在一个学校甚至一个班级因“四·三派”、“四·四派”的对立而长期互相不说话的同学，现在成了学习毛主席著作的“一对红”。原来互相攻击、谩骂甚至打架的，现在坐在一条板凳上相互谈心，互作检讨。大家向毛主席保证：“不当‘四·三派’、不当‘四·四派’，要当毛主席的革命派！”学习班总结了革命小将之间这一变化，开始“背靠背”，后来“面对面”，最后“肩并肩”一起战斗！
    表扬先进典型，狠抓积极因素，迅速促进了革命的大联合
    学习班的第三点体会是：表扬先进，大抓积极因素，运用先进典型，进行活的教育。民族学院附中两派头头，半年来各带一班人马，你想整垮我，我想吃掉你。你用放大镜找我的缺点，我用显微镜找你的错误，各占“山头”，互相攻击，“内战”打了几个月。结果，给学校的无产阶级文化大革命造成了严重的损失。大联合联不了，大批判批不了，三结合结不了。混淆了敌我界限，分散了精力。两派头头在集训班的讲用会上，以严肃的态度，革命的姿态，当众进行了公开的自我批评。他们的批评在集训班震动很大，普遍认为是触及灵魂的检查。集训班的解放军辅导员，当即表扬了他们勇于自我批评，敢于自我革命的大无畏的精神，并号召集训班的同志向他们学习。许多同志不甘落后，纷纷进行自我批评。三十五中的两派头头风格更高，他们把两派互相攻击，互相拆台的所谓内部机密，全都在集训班的讲用会上一古脑儿的端了出来。“四·三派”的一个同学郝仁亮了一次思想，没有把最丑最疼的东西全部兜底。当他听了“四·四派”一个同学刘胜“亮底”后，感到他“亮的诚恳，听的舒畅”。于是，他又第二次上台亮思想。刘胜更为感动的说，我俩是一个学校，一个年级，原来在一个战斗队共同战斗了八个月，后来因为观点不一致分成了两半，打了半年“内战”，想不到在集训班又重新携起手来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是破私立公的伟大胜利。“半年思想不见面，今日交心分外亲”，他们在毛泽东思想的旗帜下又重新团结起来了。他们两人的团结，又在集训班产生了连锁反应。女一中、女三中等对立情绪较严重的学校，都一个一个的解决了问题。解放军充分运用这些活的榜样，对大家进行活生生的教育，并乘全国革命大联合的东风，因势利导，促成了中学的革命大联合。
    学习班是在九月中旬举办的。当时全国出现了大联合的高潮。九月二十日，他们听了中央负责同志关于实现革命大联合迎接国庆的报告，当天夜里赶回学校传达讨论。因为时间晚了，大多数同学已经回家。他们就一个一个地往回找，连夜开会，讨论大联合，实现大联合。不少学校都战斗了一个通宵。二十一日、二十二日就掀起了中等学校革命大联合的高潮。现在全市中学百分之九十九都联合起来了，并有一百七十六所中等学校实现了革命的“三结合”，建立了革命委员会。
    内外结合，沟通思想，促进广大师生的思想革命化
    学习班的第四点体会是：集训红卫兵头头要同发动群众有机的结合起来，不要关起门来集训，要造成一种头头带群众，群众促头头，互相勉励，互相促进，共同提高的生动活泼局面。集训班开办的初期，发现不少头头有思想顾虑，认为光提高他们头头的阶级觉悟还不够，还得作广大革命师生的思想政治工作。例如女六中“鲁迅兵团”的头头，认识到小资产阶级派性的严重危害，有了大联合的强烈愿望，但是，回到学校同战友们一商量，有的说她是“出卖同志”、“叛变组织”、“泄露了组织机密”。解放军的辅导员了解到这种情况，深深地感到“抓了少数，丢掉多数”，关起门来孤立的搞集训班不行。需要内外结合，扩大教育面。一方面要搞好红卫兵头头的集训，另方面不能放松在校广大革命师生的教育。为了把内外结合起来互相促进，集训班召开讲用会或先进典型报告会，就组织学校里更多的人参加。同时，让红卫兵头头白天集中精力学习，晚上也给他们适当的时机回校向全体战友们汇报学习情况，沟通内外思想，互相了解情况。集训班谈形势，谈联合，谈批判；学校的广大革命师生也谈形势，谈联合，谈批判，内外一气，互相促进，共同提高。
    参加学习的革命师生一致认为：这样的训练班
  “好得很”，训练一下和不训练就是“大不一样”。大家一致赞扬：学习班是“毛泽东思想的大学校”，是“斗私批修的好课堂”，都要求这样的学习班继续办下去。现在，北京卫戍区军训指挥部所属各联合指挥部举办的第二期毛泽东思想学习班已经开始，除各革命群众组织负责人参加外，还分别举办干部和教师学习班。
