The anti-China and anti-Chinese policies of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime have met with resistance from the Indonesian people. Under the severe white terror, the broad masses of the Indonesian people have unlimited love for New China and shout with deep emotion: "Long live Mao Zedong!" They withstand the treacherous waves of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment from the Indonesian reactionaries, risking their lives to protect the overseas Chinese who are being persecuted by the Indonesian reactionaries, and defend the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples.

In many places in Indonesia, the Indonesian people who are struggling on the brink of starvation give their limited rice, salted fish, fruits, and mats to the overseas Chinese whose homes have been looted by Indonesian thugs, helping the victims to overcome their difficulties. In Simeulue, Aceh, when Indonesian thugs abducted a Chinese and took him to the wilderness to bury him alive, a passing Indonesian friend, fearless of violence, rushed forward to fight the thugs and bravely rescued the Chinese.

In Banda Aceh, when a group of thugs set fire to a Chinese vegetable garden, nearby Indonesian villagers rushed to the scene and bravely extinguished the raging fire.

On the streets of Medan, when Indonesian trishaw drivers encountered a Chinese woman who could not return home due to thug attacks, they risked their lives to let her onto the trishaw and safely escorted her home.

Many Indonesian people, filled with deep anger towards the Indonesian reactionaries and warm concern for the overseas Chinese, visited the families of the deceased Chinese. On the streets of Jakarta, groups of Indonesian people participated in the funeral procession of the patriotic overseas Chinese who bravely sacrificed their lives under the reactionary butcher's knife. In Merawang, Aceh, some Indonesian people, when visiting the families of the deceased Chinese, said excitedly: "The U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Indonesian reactionaries, are our common enemies. The Indonesian people must avenge the deaths of the Chinese."

When the victims of the reactionaries were forced to leave their places of residence, the local Indonesian people, despite the threats and persecution of the reactionaries, went to the village entrances and roadsides to bid them farewell with tears, reluctant to part. In Blang Pidie, Aceh, an Indonesian friend, when bidding farewell to the Chinese, said with boundless enthusiasm: "We will educate our descendants to be friendly with China for generations to come! Friendly with the Chinese people for generations to come!"

At the Belawan port, the Indonesian people, despite the rightist soldiers' gunfire suppression, broke through the heavy obstacles and rushed to the port to enthusiastically see off the Chinese returning home. Many Indonesian friends repeatedly shouted: "Long live Mao Zedong!"

Countless moving examples show that the Indonesian people and the Chinese people are heart to heart.

    顶住印尼反动派反华的险风恶浪　保卫中国和印尼人民的战斗友谊
    印尼人民和中国人民心连心
    据新华社二十九日讯  雅加达消息：苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的反华排华政策遭到了印度尼西亚人民的反抗。处在严重白色恐怖下的广大印尼人民无限热爱新中国，以无比深厚的感情高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”他们顶住印尼反动派反华排华的险风恶浪，冒着风险，保护遭到印尼反动派迫害的华侨，保卫中国和印尼人民之间的战斗友谊。
    在印尼的许多地方，挣扎在饥饿线上的印尼人民，把他们自己仅有的大米、咸鱼、水果和草席，赠给被印尼暴徒洗劫一空的华侨，帮助受害华侨战胜困难。在亚齐地区的司马威，印尼暴徒绑架一个华侨到野外活埋时，过路的印尼朋友不畏强暴，上前和暴徒搏斗，英勇地救出这个华侨。
    在班达·亚齐，一批暴徒丧心病狂地纵火焚烧一座华侨菜园时，附近印尼村民闻讯赶来，奋不顾身地扑灭了熊熊烈火。
    在棉兰街头，印尼三轮车工人遇见华侨妇女因暴徒袭击而不能回到住所时，便冒着风险请这位华侨妇女上车，一直把她安全护送回家。
    许多印尼人民怀着对印尼反动派的无比愤怒和对华侨的亲切关怀，慰问死难华侨家属。在雅加达街头，一群群的印尼人民参加了英勇牺牲在反动派屠刀下的爱国华侨的送葬行列。在亚齐地区的米拉务，一些印尼人民在慰问死难华侨家属时激动地说：“美帝和它的走狗印尼反动派是我们的共同敌人。印尼人民一定要为死难华侨报仇。”
    当受害华侨遭到印尼反动派驱逐，被迫离开他们的侨居地时，当地印尼人民不顾反动派的威胁和迫害，到村口、路边挥泪送别，依依不舍。亚齐地区打巴端的印尼朋友在送别华侨时，无限热情地说：“我们要教育自己的子孙，世世代代和中国友好！世世代代和中国人民友好！”
    在勿拉湾码头，印尼人民不顾右派军人的鸣枪镇压，冲破重重阻拦，涌到码头边热情欢送华侨回国。许多印尼朋友一再高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
    无数激动人心的事例说明，印尼人民和中国人民心连心。
