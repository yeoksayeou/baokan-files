Recently, the leaders of the Indian reactionary government, such as Indira Gandhi, Desai, and Singh, have been busy with diplomatic activities. Some have gone to Moscow, others to Washington, some to Tokyo, and others to various countries in Asia and Europe. What is the purpose of all this frantic activity?

The leaders of the Indian government are conducting these intense diplomatic activities amidst their deepening crisis of rule. Their activities are guided by a single black thread: adapting to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, serving the anti-China and counter-revolutionary conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, in order to obtain more dollars and rubles to maintain the Indian reactionaries' desperate struggle for survival.

To beg for "aid" from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the Indian reactionaries have openly provoked military incidents along the Chinese border. Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai spread lies before going to the United States, claiming that China had "occupied" Indian "territory" and demanding to "recover" the territory. Soon after, Indian troops launched armed provocations along the Chinese border. Desai openly declared in the United States that he wanted to create "two Chinas." Thus, the Indian reactionaries obtained one hundred thousand tons of American grain from their American masters. Indian Defense Minister Singh, immediately after the armed provocations by the Indian army, went to Moscow to report and receive rewards. The Indian Prime Minister and the Minister of Industrial Development followed suit. They finally obtained five hundred million rubles in economic "aid." During this period, the Indian reactionaries used their cheap cannon fodder to create two armed conflicts along the Sikkim border with China, to curry favor with their masters. The leaders of the Indian government did not hide the fact that, wherever they went, the so-called "Indo-China situation" was the main topic of discussion. They used this to incite anti-China sentiment. The servile nature of the Indian reactionaries was fully exposed!

This group of reactionary politicians' main purpose in their activities in Southeast Asian countries is to attempt, under the banner of so-called "regional economic cooperation," to help U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism form an anti-China encirclement. Former Indian Foreign Minister Chagla had openly declared that they wanted to "realize" the "containment" of China by "developing the economy of Southeast Asia." Indian Deputy Prime Minister Desai went further, admitting that they wanted to form a "political" anti-China alliance with the reactionary forces of the countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. Moreover, the Indian reactionary government threatened to conclude military treaties with South Asian countries like Burma, aimed at China. It is clear that, in the situation where the Southeast Asia collective has already become a mere shell, the deluded Indian reactionaries are attempting to establish a new Southeast Asia collective centered on India, aimed at China and the peoples of Asia, to serve as a tool for the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism.

When the leaders of the Indian reactionary government were busy with their activities, they also supported the new "peace talks" fraud of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism on the Vietnam issue. They also collaborated with the Soviet revisionists and the Tito clique to pressure the Arab peoples to surrender to U.S. imperialism and its running dog Israel. This is a blatant act of helping U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism sabotage the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa, further exposing the Indian reactionary government as a shameful running dog of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in their implementation of neo-colonialism.

Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the Indian reactionaries are so arrogant in their anti-China and counter-revolutionary activities because they want to raise their own status and become the chief lackey of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in the Southeast Asia region. However, things are not as smooth as they imagine. The lackeys of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism each have their own ulterior motives. Other countries are also unwilling to follow the discredited Indian reactionaries. The so-called "regional economic cooperation" and "political alliance" proposed by the Indian reactionary government, although loudly proclaimed, have not received any enthusiastic response, and thus have achieved nothing so far.

Selling out the country for personal glory is the specialty of this group of Indian reactionary politicians. To obtain the alms of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, they are willing to sell out the national interests of India even further, engaging in barefaced treacherous acts. Desai, while in the United States, shamelessly promised to allow more U.S. monopolies to infiltrate India. At the same time, the more "aid" India receives from the United States and the Soviet Union, the more ruthlessly the United States and the Soviet Union plunder and control India, the more India's independence and sovereignty will be trampled upon, and the more India will be further colonialized. This is new evidence of the Indian reactionaries' betrayal of national interests. The Indian people must rise up to thoroughly settle accounts with these imperialist running dogs' crimes of betrayal.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "At present, the biggest imperialist in the world is U.S. imperialism, which has its running dogs in many countries. The people supported by imperialism are precisely the people despised by the broad masses. Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Kishi Nobusuke, Batista, Said, Mendès France and the like, either have been overthrown by the people or will be overthrown by the people."

The leaders of the Indian National Congress government are running dogs raised by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. They ruthlessly oppress and exploit the people at home and sell out national interests abroad, making themselves internally and externally besieged and in a state of great anxiety. They attempt to use the method of further currying favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and running errands for them to get out of their predicament and avoid being overthrown by the people, which is absolutely impossible.

　　印度反动派是美帝苏修的马前卒
　　本报评论员
    最近一个时期，印度反动政府的头目英迪拉·甘地、德赛、辛格之流，倾巢而出，有的走莫斯科，有的奔华盛顿，有的访东京，有的去亚洲和欧洲的其他国家，进行了紧张的外交活动。他们这样仆仆风尘，忙忙碌碌，究竟是为了什么呢？
    印度政府的头目们是在他们的统治危机日益深重的情况下四出活动的。他们这些紧张的外交活动，贯穿着一条黑线，就是适应美帝苏修的需要，为美帝苏修反华、反革命阴谋效劳，以便讨取更多的美元和卢布，来维持印度反动派苟延残喘的统治。
    为了向美帝苏修乞讨“援助”，印度反动派公然对中国边境发动军事挑衅，制造事端。印度副总理兼财政部长德赛，在到美国之前大肆造谣说中国“占领”印度
  “领土”，并叫嚷要“收回领土”。接着印度军队就发动了向中国边境的武装挑衅。德赛在美国公开叫嚣要制造
  “两个中国”。这样，印度反动派就从美国主子那里讨得了一百万吨美粮。印度国防部长辛格则在印度军队武装挑衅之后，立即去莫斯科请功领赏。印度总理和工业发展部长也接踵而至。他们最后讨得了五亿卢布的经济“援助”。在这个期间，印度反动派利用他们的廉价炮灰，两次在中国锡金边境制造了武装冲突事件，以博得其主子的欢心。印度政府的头目毫不隐讳，他们所到之处，所谓“中印局势”是会谈的主要议题。他们极力借此煽动反华。印度反动派的奴才相，真是暴露得淋漓尽致！
    这一伙反动政客在东南亚国家活动的主要目的，是企图在所谓“区域性经济合作”的招牌下，为美帝苏修拼凑反华包围圈。印度前外长查格拉曾经公开叫嚷说，要“通过发展东南亚的经济来实现”对中国的“遏制”。印度副总理德赛更进一步供认，他们要“同东南亚和太平洋地区”各国反动派搞“政治性”的反华联盟。不仅如此，印度反动政府还扬言，要同缅甸等南亚国家缔结“针对中国的”军事条约。很明显，在东南亚集团已经名存实亡的情况下，不自量力的印度反动派企图建立一个以印度为中心的、针对中国和亚洲各国人民的新的东南亚集团，以充当美帝国主义侵略政策的工具。
    印度反动政府的头目们在四出活动的时候，还在越南问题上为美帝苏修兜售的“和谈”新骗局帮腔。他们又同苏修和铁托集团相配合，多方诱迫阿拉伯人民向美帝及其走狗以色列屈服。这是明目张胆地帮助美帝苏修破坏亚非各国人民的反帝斗争，进一步暴露了印度反动政府是美帝苏修推行新殖民主义的一名可耻的马前卒。
    印度反动派在美帝苏修的策动下，这样猖狂地进行反华、反革命活动，对他们说来，是想借以抬高自己的身价，充当东南亚地区美帝苏修的奴才总管。但是，事情并不象他们所想象的那么顺利。美帝苏修的奴才们各怀鬼胎。另一些国家也不愿意跟着声名扫地的印度反动派打转转。印度反动政府提出的什么东南亚“区域性经济合作”，什么“政治性”联盟，虽然叫得很响，但是并没有什么人热心响应，因此至今还是一事无成。
    卖国求荣，是这一伙印度反动政客的拿手本领。他们为了讨得美帝苏修的施舍，不惜更进一步出卖印度的民族利益，进行了赤裸裸的卖国的勾当。德赛在美国摇尾乞怜地保证使美国垄断资本更大量地渗入印度。同时，印度政府接受美“援”苏“援”越多，美帝和苏修对印度的掠夺和控制就更变本加厉，印度的独立主权就要受到更大的蹂躏，印度就要进一步殖民地化。这是印度反动派出卖民族利益的新的罪证。印度人民一定要起来彻底清算这些帝国主义走卒的卖国罪行。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“当前世界上最大的帝国主义是美帝国主义，在很多国家有它的走狗。帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。蒋介石、李承晚、岸信介、巴蒂斯塔、赛义德、曼德列斯之流，或者已经被人民所推翻，或者将要被人民所推翻。”
    印度国大党政府的头目们，就是美帝和苏修所豢养的走狗。他们对内残酷压迫和剥削人民，对外出卖民族利益，使自己陷于内外交困，惶惶不可终日的境地。他们企图用进一步投靠美帝苏修，为之奔走效劳的办法来摆脱自己的困境，逃避被人民推翻的命运，是绝对不可能的。
