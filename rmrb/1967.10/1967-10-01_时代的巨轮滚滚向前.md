The wheel of history rolls on, following the course set by our great leader and helmsman Chairman Mao, breaking waves and advancing victoriously. Today, as we celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I want to enthusiastically shout: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the greatest leader, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

Our great leader, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, and our beloved Vice Chairman Lin, said, "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is the locomotive that propels our country forward on the socialist and communist track. Under the great Mao Zedong Thought, after more than a year of fierce struggle, we have achieved the greatest victory with the smallest cost. "The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today's scene surpasses the past; the world is turned upside down, and the sentiment is profound." Our great motherland has never been as prosperous as it is today; our proletarian dictatorship has never been as consolidated as it is today; our People's Liberation Army has never been as powerful as it is today; the revolutionary spirit and labor enthusiasm of our people have never been as high as they are today; and our enemies have never been as isolated and disheartened as they are today. Before us lies a bright future and an unprecedentedly good situation.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our People's Liberation Army has received the best education and training, achieving the greatest and fastest progress. Over the past year, the practice of class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and the struggle between two roads has fully proven that the People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is not only invincible in combat against armed enemies but also irresistible and all-conquering in combat against unarmed enemies. It is truly a unique and unparalleled proletarian revolutionary army, the most reliable and strongest pillar of our proletarian dictatorship.

Vice Chairman Lin said, "All our achievements and victories are the result of Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought." Over the past year, the strengthening of our army, the further development of our socialist cause, and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are all the results of Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

It is Chairman Mao who taught us: "In the historical stage of socialism, class struggle, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist, as well as the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and the danger of capitalist restoration." This has made us see clearly and further understand that throughout the entire socialist period, we must always grasp the key of class struggle, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, adhere to the socialist road, and prevent the sabotage and destruction by class enemies of various kinds. More than a year of struggle has strengthened our class struggle consciousness, raised our awareness of line struggle, and solidified our socialist direction. We have also come to understand more deeply that only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can we carry the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end.

It is Chairman Mao who taught us: "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." This has made us understand that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must not only fight against armed enemies to liberate Taiwan and defend the country but also fight against unarmed enemies who have infiltrated into the Party and the government, especially concentrate our firepower to smash the hidden bourgeois headquarters. Over the past year, together with hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, we have further exposed and criticized the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, recognized the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, enhanced our ability to identify counter-revolutionary two-faced elements who wave the red flag to oppose it, and improved our combat effectiveness against various enemies.

It is Chairman Mao who taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing and consolidating power." This has made us further understand the fundamental task of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and raised our awareness of defending the dictatorship of the proletariat. Since its birth, our army has been a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks. "Apart from fighting to destroy the enemy's military force, it also has to undertake the major tasks of propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary power, and even building the organization of the Communist Party." Over the past year, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, in the process of helping the proletarian revolutionary masses to grasp and use power, we have firmly planted the roots of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our minds and played the role of the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our actions.

It is Chairman Mao who taught us: The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left. This has made us understand more deeply that the People's Liberation Army must be the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionary masses and become the reliable defender of the great democracy of the proletariat. Over the past year, we have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, fully trusted the masses, relied on the masses, and respected the masses' pioneering spirit. We have firmly supported the revolutionary actions of the broad masses of the left, fought side by side with them, and achieved one great victory after another, winning the love and support of the revolutionary masses and further strengthening the relationship between the army and the people.

It is Chairman Mao who taught us: "The current cultural revolution is only the first one, and there will inevitably be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, capitalist restoration may occur at any time." This has made us have a more adequate mental preparation for the complexity and long-term nature of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and we have resolved to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In summary, it is our greatest leader, Chairman Mao, who has brilliantly solved the theoretical and practical problems of carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage and promoting the progress of world history. We have grown up in the era of Mao Zedong and have been nurtured by the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought. At this moment of celebrating a great festival, we are full of boundless energy. Today, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, I will definitely, together with all my comrades-in-arms, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement." The most important task at present is to achieve new merits in the great criticism of the revolution.

    时代的巨轮滚滚向前
　　廖初江
    时代的巨轮，正在沿着我们伟大领袖、伟大舵手毛主席指引的航道，乘风破浪，胜利前进。今天，我们在无产阶级文化大革命取得辉煌胜利的凯歌声中，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年，我要热烈欢呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席最亲密的战友、我们敬爱的林副主席说：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是使我国永远沿着社会主义、共产主义轨道突飞猛进的火车头。在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下，经过一年多来的激烈搏斗，我们以最小最小最小的代价，取得了最大最大最大的胜利。“虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”我们伟大的祖国，从来没有象今天这样昌盛；我们的无产阶级专政，从来没有象今天这样巩固；我们人民解放军，从来没有象今天这样强大；我国人民的革命精神和劳动热情，从来没有象今天这样高涨；我们的敌人，也从来没有象今天这样孤立和沮丧。我们的面前，是一片光明，一派空前大好的形势。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们人民解放军，受到了最大最好的教育和锻炼，得到了最大最快的提高和进步。一年多来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争实践，充分证明：由毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，不但在同拿枪的敌人作战中，攻无不克，战无不胜，而且在同不拿枪的敌人作战中，也是锐不可挡，所向披靡。真正是一支文武双全、举世无双的无产阶级革命军队，是我国无产阶级专政最可靠、最坚强的柱石。
    林副主席说：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”一年来，我们军队的更加强大，同我国社会主义事业的进一步发展、无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利一样，都是毛主席英明领导的结果，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    是毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”使我们擦亮了眼睛，进一步明确了：在整个社会主义时期，始终要抓住阶级斗争这条纲，要站稳无产阶级立场，坚持社会主义道路，防止形形色色阶级敌人的捣乱和破坏。一年多的斗争实践，使我们增强了阶级斗争观念，提高了路线斗争的觉悟，坚定了社会主义的方向。我们也更加懂得了：只有无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能把无产阶级专政下的革命进行到底。
    是毛主席教导我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”使我们懂得了，在无产阶级专政下，不但要为解放台湾、保卫国防，同拿枪的敌人作战，还要同混入党和政府里的不拿枪的敌人作战，特别是要集中火力打掉隐蔽的资产阶级司令部。一年多来，我们同亿万革命人民一起，在彻底揭露、彻底批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，进一步认清了无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象，增强了识别打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面派的本领，提高了同各种敌人作斗争的战斗力。
    是毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”使我们进一步明确了无产阶级专政下进行革命的根本任务，提高了捍卫无产阶级专政的自觉性。我军从诞生的那天起，就是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。“它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”一年多来，我们同无产阶级革命派一起，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权的斗争中，在帮助无产阶级革命派掌权用权的过程中，在头脑里牢固地扎下了无产阶级专政的根子，在行动上发挥了无产阶级专政柱石的作用。
    是毛主席教导我们：人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。使我们更深刻地懂得：人民解放军必须做无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，成为无产阶级大民主的可靠保卫者。一年多来，我们遵照毛主席的教导，充分地信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。我们坚决支持左派广大群众的革命行动，和他们团结在一起，并肩战斗，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，受到了革命群众的爱戴和支持，进一步密切了军民关系。
    是毛主席教导我们：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”使我们对无产阶级专政下革命的复杂性、长期性有了更充分的思想准备，下定决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    总之，是我们最伟大的领袖毛主席英明地解决了无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，推动了世界历史的前进。我们生长在毛泽东时代，又是毛泽东思想的阳光雨露直接哺育成长起来的解放军战士，在欢庆伟大节日的时刻，浑身充满了使不完的力量。在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的今天，我一定要和全军同志一道，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决响应林副主席的伟大号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”当前最主要的是在革命的大批判中立新功。
