The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are intensifying their military collaboration against China. The two sides are conducting dirty deals over anti-missile systems.

    The successful detonation of China's hydrogen bomb has greatly encouraged the revolutionary peoples of the world, but it has frightened the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. Their nuclear monopoly has further collapsed, and their nuclear blackmail has lost its effectiveness. In their dismay, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have closely colluded, preparing to establish what they call an "anti-ballistic missile system" in a frenzied attempt to counter China.

    On September 18, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara publicly announced that the U.S. had decided to commence the construction of a specialized "anti-ballistic missile system" aimed at China by the end of the year. Prior to this, the U.S. imperialists had informed the Soviet revisionist clique of their plan to establish a $50 billion anti-missile system. The French newspaper *Le Figaro* recently reported that "the establishment of a sparse anti-missile network by the U.S. was a tacit agreement reached during the Johnson-Kosygin Glassboro talks."

    Currently, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are engaged in dirty backroom dealings. According to Western media reports, when the U.S. announced the establishment of such a system, it repeatedly assured the Soviet revisionists that it was not directed against the Soviet Union, urging them to rest easy. McNamara himself openly stated: "We have proposed talks with the Soviet Union on this issue." The U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, revealed on September 21 at the UN General Assembly that some time ago, the U.S. had expressed to the Soviet Union its hope to reach an understanding to limit the deployment of such missiles.

    The Soviet revisionists, of course, understood these assurances well and have been following suit in these counter-revolutionary activities. According to multiple disclosures from Western countries, "the Soviet Union began deploying such missiles a year ago." On this issue, "the common interests of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are increasing," because "the future threat from China" is what they are most concerned about. This shows that the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are forming a de facto anti-China military alliance.

### 美帝苏修加紧在军事上合伙反华  双方就反导弹系统问题进行肮脏交易

　　美帝苏修加紧在军事上合伙反华
    双方就反导弹系统问题进行肮脏交易
    本报讯　中国的氢弹爆炸成功，极大地鼓舞了世界革命人民，但是吓坏了美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团。它们的核垄断进一步破产了，核讹诈不灵了。于是，在懊丧之余，美帝同苏修紧密勾结，准备建立什么“反弹道导弹系统”，疯狂进行反华。
    九月十八日，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉公开宣布美国已决定在年底着手建立专门“针对中国”的
  “反弹道导弹系统”。在此之前，美帝国主义曾经通知苏修集团，说美国打算建立耗资五十亿美元的反导弹系统。法国《费加罗报》最近报道，“美国建立稀疏的反导弹网，是约翰逊和柯西金的葛拉斯堡罗会谈作出的默契”。
    现在，美苏两国正在进行肮脏的幕后交易。据西方报刊报道，美国宣布建立这种系统时，曾再三向苏修表示，不是针对苏联的，要其放心。麦克纳马拉自己也毫不隐讳地说：“我们已建议和苏联就这一问题进行会谈。”美国驻联合国代表戈德堡九月二十一日在联合国大会上也透露，若干时候以前，美国已向苏联表示希望取得一种谅解来限制部署这种导弹。
    苏修对美国这种表示当然心领神会，它亦步亦趋也在进行这种反革命勾当。据西方国家多次透露，“俄国在一年以前就开始在部署这种导弹”。在这个问题上，“美苏两国的共同利益越来越多”，因为，“中国的未来威胁”是它们所迫切担忧的。这就说明，美帝和苏修正在结成事实上的反华军事同盟。
