The Hong Kong British authorities have wildly sabotaged the celebration activities of Hong Kong patriots for National Day. The Chinese government has lodged the strongest protest with the British government, demanding that the British government guarantee that such incidents will not happen again, otherwise it must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom.

New China News Agency, October 9th: A responsible official from the Western European Affairs Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires, Hopson, this evening to hand him a note, lodging the strongest protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' wild sabotage of the celebration activities of Chinese patriots for National Day, pointing out that this is a new serious political provocation by the Hong Kong British authorities against the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. The full text of the note is as follows:

British Chargé d'Affaires Office:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China requests that the British Chargé d'Affaires Office immediately convey the following to the British government.

On October 1st, the Chinese cargo ship Nan Hai 133, docked at the Whampoa Dock in the Western District of Hong Kong, and other ships held a celebration to mark the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, including a fireworks display. The Hong Kong British authorities dispatched gunboats, police launches, and helicopters to interfere with and provoke our crew members. The Hong Kong British authorities even mobilized a large number of "riot police" to suppress the crowd gathered onshore to watch the fireworks, releasing tear gas and opening fire, killing one Chinese resident on the spot and arresting nearly a hundred others.

On October 2nd, the Hong Kong British authorities again mobilized British troops in the Sheung Wan and Central districts of Hong Kong, brazenly tearing down and seizing the national flags of the People's Republic of China hanging in patriotic shops. It is known that more than ten flags were destroyed, and some flagpoles were also cut down.

In fact, before October 1st, the Hong Kong British authorities had been conducting large-scale searches and arrests of the premises of various trade unions and residents, disrupting the patriotic unions and residents' National Day celebrations. On September 30th, Hong Kong British agents even conducted a humiliating personal search of Zhang Wenzhong, the deputy manager of the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China, who was participating in the National Day activities.

At a time when Hong Kong patriots are enthusiastically celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong British authorities have chosen this moment to openly dispatch military and police to insult and damage the national flags hanging in patriotic shops, killing and arresting patriotic compatriots participating in the celebrations. This is a new serious political provocation against the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. For this, the Chinese government lodges the strongest protest with the British government.

For several months, the Hong Kong British authorities, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese government, have not stopped their various fascist suppressions and persecutions of Hong Kong patriots. Now, the British government, on the one hand, talks about easing Sino-British relations, while on the other hand, instructs the Hong Kong British authorities to adopt even more barbaric measures, disrupting the sacred and inviolable rights of Hong Kong patriots to celebrate their great national holiday. This only fully exposes the hypocritical face of the British government and fully exposes its reactionary nature of intentionally opposing the Chinese people.

The Chinese government demands that the British government immediately accept the various demands previously made by the Chinese government regarding the resolution of the Hong Kong issue, and for this serious incident of the Hong Kong British authorities destroying the Chinese national flag, acknowledge the error, publicly apologize, punish the culprits, release the arrested Chinese residents, compensate the bereaved families of the deceased residents, and compensate all losses suffered by the affected residents; guarantee that such incidents will not happen again. Otherwise, the British government must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom.

    港英当局疯狂破坏香港爱国同胞庆祝国庆活动
    我国政府向英政府提出最强烈抗议
    要求英政府保证不再发生类似事件，否则必须对由此而引起的一切后果负完全责任
    新华社九日讯　我国外交部西欧司负责人今天晚间召见英国驻华代办霍普森，交给他一份照会，最强烈抗议香港英国当局疯狂破坏我爱国同胞庆祝国庆活动的罪行，指出这是港英当局对中华人民共和国和中国人民的新的严重政治挑衅。照会全文如下：英国驻华代办处：
    中华人民共和国外交部要求英国代办处立即把下列事项转告英国政府。
    十月一日，停泊在香港西区招商局码头的中国南海一三三号货轮等船只，为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年，举行燃放焰火等联欢活动。香港英国当局竟然派遣炮艇、水警轮和直升飞机，向我船员进行干涉和挑衅。香港英国当局甚至出动大批“防暴队”，对在岸上聚集观看焰火的群众进行镇压，施放催泪弹，并开枪射击，当场打死中国居民一人，另有近一百人被捕。
    十月二日，香港英国当局又出动英国陆军，在香港上环区和中环区一带，悍然撕毁并抢走我爱国商店悬挂的中华人民共和国国旗。已知被毁坏的国旗就有十多面，有的旗杆也被斩断。
    事实上，香港英国当局，在十月一日以前，就对香港各业工会会所和居民大肆搜查逮捕，破坏爱国工会和居民庆祝国庆节的活动。九月三十日，香港英国特务竟然对参加国庆活动的中国银行香港分行副经理章文中，进行侮辱性的人身搜查。
    在香港爱国同胞热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的时候，香港英国当局竟然选择这个时机，公然出动军警侮辱、毁损爱国商号悬挂的国旗，杀害、逮捕参加庆祝活动的爱国同胞，这是对中华人民共和国和中国人民的新的严重政治挑衅。为此，中国政府特向英国政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    几个月来，香港英国当局不顾中国政府的一再警告，一直没有停止对香港爱国同胞的种种法西斯镇压和迫害。现在，英国政府一方面侈谈要缓和中英两国关系，另一方面却又指使香港英国当局变本加厉地采取上述种种野蛮手段，破坏香港爱国同胞庆祝自己祖国伟大节日的神圣不可侵犯的权利。这只能彻底暴露英国政府的伪善面貌，彻底暴露它蓄意要与中国人民为敌的反动本质。
    中国政府要求英国政府立即接受过去中国政府提出的关于解决香港问题的历次要求，并且对这次香港英国当局毁坏中国国旗的严重事件，承认错误，公开道歉；惩办凶手；释放被捕的中国居民；抚恤死难居民，赔偿受害居民一切损失；保证不再发生类似事件。否则，英国政府必须对由此而引起的一切后果负完全的责任。
