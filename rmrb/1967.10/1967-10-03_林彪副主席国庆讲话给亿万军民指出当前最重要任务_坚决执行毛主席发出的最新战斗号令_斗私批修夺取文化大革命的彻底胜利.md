According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated October 2, the vast numbers of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country, while celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, have studied in earnest the extremely important speech given by our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Deputy Chairman Lin Biao, at the national celebration rally in the capital. They have also studied the editorial article "Long Live the Victory of the Cultural Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" published in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. Everyone unanimously pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao's speech is the latest battle command issued by Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao to the revolutionary masses and the vast numbers of revolutionary cadres across the country. We resolutely support it and will resolutely carry it out.

When Comrade Lin Biao's speech was broadcast to various places, the entire country was in a state of great excitement. People enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They enthusiastically celebrated the decisive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country, the unprecedented good situation in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They expressed their determination to firmly grasp the general direction of the revolutionary struggle with the four characters "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist" recently indicated by Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry out a broader and deeper revolutionary criticism. In the revolutionary criticism, they will further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform in their respective units, and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, planting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every battlefield.

After studying Comrade Lin Biao's speech and the important article "Long Live the Victory of the Cultural Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," the revolutionary workers, peasants, and Red Guards in the capital expressed with even greater confidence: We will definitely hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest great policy of "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist," and achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution! The revolutionary workers of the Capital Steel Company said that, just like the situation across the country, our company is also in an unprecedentedly good situation. The revolutionary criticism is being carried out vigorously, and production is also booming, with continuous reports of production victories. The imperialists of the United States, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries hoped that this great revolution would disrupt our national economy, but their illusions have been completely shattered. In the great call of Chairman Mao, many large and medium-sized schools in the capital that have already achieved revolutionary great alliance said that Chairman Mao's inspection has given us great encouragement, and Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech has pointed out the direction for us to advance victoriously. We will definitely study earnestly and carry it out resolutely. They expressed that they would further learn from the workers and peasants, take "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist" as the guiding principle on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, further consolidate the revolutionary great alliance, promote the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Shanxi, Qinghai, and other places excitedly said that the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great commander Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victories in just over a year. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the great victory of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards of Shanghai Jiaotong University enthusiastically said: Under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, our great socialist motherland has gone through an 18-year glorious journey. The wise and great leader Chairman Mao has led the people of the entire country to repel the repeated ferocious attacks of the bourgeoisie and achieved one great victory after another. However, our combat mission is still very arduous. We will definitely respond to the battle call of Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin, advance bravely under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist." Comrade Li Zaichen, the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, said in an article he wrote for the New Guizhou Daily that the "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist" mentioned in Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech is the latest battle command issued by Chairman Mao to the people of the entire country, and we must rise to the occasion and carry it out resolutely. We must definitely promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, study to a new level, and use to a new level, planting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought throughout every inch of Guizhou's land, and making Guizhou a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres in Jinan City proudly said that in the past year of the proletarian cultural revolution, the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev has been smashed, and the broad revolutionary cadres have been educated and tempered. We revolutionary cadres have also been tested and tempered in the revolutionary crucible. Under the drive of the revolution, the production front of industry and agriculture has been reporting continuous victories, achieving tremendous results. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting of the standing committee on the evening of October 1, specifically to study and discuss Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech. Everyone unanimously agreed that this speech summarized the great situation of the proletarian cultural revolution and pointed out the direction of struggle for the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, clarifying the future tasks. We must study it well and implement it resolutely. The person in charge of the Jinzhong core group of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province said that the situation in our Jinzhong region is very good. The entire region has seen a magnificent wave of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great alliance. We must grasp the revolution and promote production, striving to achieve "six goods" in agriculture and make new contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution. The revolutionary cadres of the August 18 Revolutionary Congress of Qinghai expressed: We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our actions, overcome all non-proletarian thoughts, and strive to achieve the revolutionization of thought.

The preparatory committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a mobilization meeting to respond to Chairman Mao's great command to criticize and repudiate the private and the revisionist on the morning of October 2. All members of the provincial revolutionary committee preparatory committee, military leaders, and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who attended the meeting jointly studied Comrade Deputy Commander Lin's important speech. Everyone unanimously expressed that Chairman Mao's latest instruction of "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist" is the great battle program for the hundreds of millions of people in our country to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use the great Mao Zedong Thought to "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist," and achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

We must remember it and carry it out resolutely. We steel workers not only dare to fight against class enemies but also dare to fight against the "private" character. The revolutionary cadres of the Hohhot Railway Bureau said that after studying Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech, we are determined to further earnestly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp the Revolution and Promote Production" and better complete this year's transportation and production tasks.

The Red Guards of Tianjin Nankai University said, "We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. We will definitely execute the latest instruction of the supreme commander: to criticize and repudiate the private and the revisionist. We will launch a larger-scale mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the 'private' character in our minds and fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated October 2, the extremely important speech given by our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin, at the national celebration rally for the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, greatly inspired the revolutionary fighting spirit of the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and greatly encouraged their firm confidence in defending and participating in the proletarian cultural revolution. The soldiers and officers expressed: Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin, representing our supreme commander Chairman Mao, issued the latest instruction of "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist." We support it a thousand times and will execute it ten thousand times. We will definitely hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, steadfastly and confidently strive to achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, and create new merits for the people.

Many military party committees and leading organs have, in the past two days, convened meetings in a swift and decisive manner to study and discuss Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's extremely important speech. The leaders of the Beijing Military Region who participated in the national day review at Tiananmen Square immediately convened an expanded meeting of the standing committee after the celebration rally ended, seriously discussed Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech, and notified the soldiers and officers of all subordinate units to repeatedly and seriously study Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech, further promote the revolutionization of thought, and do a better job in military construction and the "three supports and two militaries" work, striving for greater achievements. The leading organ of the Nanjing Military Region, after studying Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech, immediately issued a notice requiring all subordinate units to take the study, implementation, and propaganda of Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech as the primary task of current political work. The Inner Mongolia Military Region also immediately convened an expanded meeting of the standing committee, making specific regulations on how to study and implement Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech. The leading organs of the General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, National Defense Science and Technology Commission, National Defense Industry Office, Navy, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps also conducted extensive study and discussion of Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech in the past two days.

The soldiers and officers held many study sessions and symposiums, sharing their study experiences and expressing their future resolutions. Many units in the Beijing, Wuhan, Lanzhou, and Guangzhou military regions, in order to quickly convey the content of Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech to the broad revolutionary masses, made slides and performed artistic programs based on the content of the speech and propagated them extensively in factories and rural areas. On the remote front lines of the sea and border defenses, some units even sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to explain the spirit of Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech to the people of all ethnic groups in the area.

While studying Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech, the broad masses of soldiers and officers generally reviewed the brilliant achievements of the proletarian cultural revolution over the past year. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region said that Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's summary of the achievements of the cultural revolution hit the mark. Based on the spirit of Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech and their personal experiences, they enthusiastically praised the great victory and unprecedented good situation of the cultural revolution. They said that the cultural revolution greatly established the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; greatly popularized Mao Zedong Thought; thoroughly defeated the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, causing them to collapse completely; greatly trained and cultivated successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause; greatly raised the proletarian consciousness of the people of our country, promoting the revolutionization of thought; greatly strengthened and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat; greatly promoted socialist revolution and socialist construction; greatly accelerated the demise of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, and made outstanding contributions to the world revolution. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in the Kunming Military Region said in a symposium that only Chairman Mao has such courage and wisdom to grasp the ship so well, break through the rapids and shoals, and lead the millions of revolutionary armies to surge forward. Chairman Mao's contributions are as great as the sky, and Chairman Mao's kindness is as deep as the sea. Even if we use the wood of ten thousand mountains as pens and the water of the East China Sea as ink, we cannot write down Chairman Mao's greatness, nor can we express our love for Chairman Mao.

Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech is a new battle command issued by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao to the military and people across the country. The broad masses of soldiers and officers, filled with the joy of victory and revolutionary enthusiasm, held meetings one after another to express their determination to create new merits for the people to Chairman Mao, our great commander, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin. They especially emphasized that Chairman Mao's latest instruction of "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist" is like a lighthouse with boundless flames, further illuminating the direction of the victory of the cultural revolution. "Criticize and Repudiate the Private and the Revisionist" is the current greatest politics, the key to achieving a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, and the most fundamental and important task of the cultural revolution. Some leading cadres of the Chengdu, Jinan, Fuzhou military regions and the Beijing Garrison Command, Tianjin Garrison Command, and other units, after hearing Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech, firmly expressed: We will, with the perseverance of the Long March of the Red Army, the determination to fight on the battlefield, the courage to fight with bayonets, and the spirit of "seizing the day," launch a fierce attack on the "private" character; closely follow the great commander Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and with the revolutionary spirit of "beating fallen dogs," fight a "people's war," vowing to completely criticize and repudiate the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" actively helped the revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses study Comrade Deputy Chairman Lin's speech. Many units of the Three Services stationed in Shanghai and in Shandong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places, which had made outstanding achievements in supporting the left, all studied together with the revolutionary masses and discussed how to implement and carry out the speech.

The leader loves the people, and the people love the leader. Chairman Mao warmly beckons to us, and we will forever follow Chairman Mao forward to victory!
