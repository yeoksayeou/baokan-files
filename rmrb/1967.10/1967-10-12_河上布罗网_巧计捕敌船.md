On a pitch-black night, the guerrilla fighters of Pengxie County silently laid out a net on the small canal from Pengxie to Lapei. The next morning, Pengxie County's platoon leader Huang Wenqin was working with the villagers by the canal. As he worked, he inspected the setup from the previous night, finding that everything was in place without any traces.

Soon, the bright red sun rose above the palm groves of Chayong District. An enemy warship was arrogantly heading towards the Lapei military camp.

Suddenly, the enemy warship, which was speeding along, was abruptly stopped. The ship's hull violently rocked a few times on the water surface before abruptly crashing onto the riverbank. At this moment, a group of guerrilla fighters emerged from the canal's edge. Platoon leader Huang Wenqin swiftly brandished his large sword, charging towards the enemy. Shouts echoed, and the air was filled with killing intent. The brave guerrilla fighters leaped onto the enemy ship; the panicked enemy was in disarray and was eventually captured.

It turned out that the Pengxie District guerrillas used the "rope-pulling method" to ambush the enemy ship. The guerrillas had previously stretched a rope across the small canal, securing it to a stake on the opposite shore and tightly wrapping it around. Then, they dug a hole by the riverbank, drove in an iron stake, and wrapped the rope around it, hiding the guerrillas in ambush. When the enemy ship arrived, they forcefully pulled the rope out of the water. The speeding enemy warship lost control upon hitting the rope. The guerrillas then seized the opportunity to attack. Thus, with one clever tactic, they achieved a significant victory.

　　河上布罗网  巧计捕敌船
    一个漆黑的夜晚，蓬协县的游击队员在从蓬协到拉柏的小运河上神不知鬼不觉地布置着一道罗网。第二天早晨，游击队排长黄文琴，在运河边上同乡亲一起劳动。他边劳动，边巡视一下昨夜的布置，觉得一切都没有露出痕迹。
    不久，鲜红的太阳已经升上了茶荣区的椰林上空。一艘敌军的战艇气势汹汹地向拉柏兵营方向驶去。
    突然，正在飞驶着的敌战艇忽然被拦住了，艇身在水面上剧烈地翻动了几下，便猛然冲上河岸。这时，运河边涌出一批游击勇士，排长黄文琴迅速挥动着大刀，向敌人冲杀过去。一时吼声四起，杀气冲天。勇猛的游击战士跃上敌艇；惊慌的敌人乱作一团，终于全部就擒了。
    原来，蓬协区的游击队使用了“牵绳法”来伏击敌艇。游击队已经事先把缆绳拉过小运河，在对岸打下桩子，缠紧缆绳。然后，又在河边挖个地洞，打个铁桩，缠紧缆绳，并且在这里埋伏下游击队。等敌艇到来时，猛烈把缆绳拉出水面。飞快的敌战艇一触缆绳便失去了控制。于是，游击队便乘机出击。就这样，一条妙计，便取得了重大胜利。
