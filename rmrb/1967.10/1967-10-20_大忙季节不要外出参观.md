The autumn harvest season this year is an extremely important political task, affecting the lives of all people in the country, the completion of the national economic development plan, and the successful progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Currently, the countryside has entered the busy autumn harvest season. We should concentrate all our efforts to achieve the six excellences in agriculture during this busy season.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not violate the agricultural season, and during the busy farming period, allow farmers to stop all meetings and mobilizations unrelated to agriculture." However, recently in our area, some communes and production teams have organized large groups of people to use production time to visit other places or hold large-scale on-site meetings during the busy autumn harvest season. Some communes even travel hundreds of miles to visit other places, requiring several trucks. Some communes organize visits where all cadres above the production team level participate, with hundreds of people going away for several days. This not only affects the production of the visiting units but also increases the burden of reception work for the visited communes and production brigades, thus affecting their production.

I believe that discovering good experiences in revolutionary criticism and production from other units, sending people to learn and exchange experiences, or organizing visits is entirely necessary. However, during the busy season, we must ensure production time and achieve the six excellences in agriculture without violating the agricultural season.

　　大忙季节不要外出参观
    今年的三秋生产是一项极为重要的政治任务，关系到全国人民的生活，关系到国民经济发展计划的完成，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行。当前，农村已进入了三秋大忙季节，我们应该集中一切力量，在三秋大忙中做到农业六好。
    毛主席教导我们：“不违农时，即在农忙时允许农民停止一切无关农业的开会与动员。”可是，最近我们这里有的社、队在三秋大忙季节，还组织大批人员利用生产时间到外地去参观或开一些大型现场会。有的公社还到几百里地以外的地方去参观，一去就得动用好几辆汽车。有的公社一组织参观就是生产队以上的干部都去，几百人一去就是好几天。这样，不但出外参观的单位耽误生产，而且使被参观的公社和生产大队增加了接待工作的负担，也耽误了生产。
    我认为，发现别的单位有革命大批判和生产上的好经验，派人去学习、交流经验，或组织一些参观是完全必要的。但是在大忙季节，必须保证生产时间，要不违农时地做到农业六好。
