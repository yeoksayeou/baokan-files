Albanian workers have triumphantly fulfilled their production plan.

According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, the Albanian working class, inspired by the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and the important teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, has since this year displayed a high revolutionary spirit, emphasized proletarian politics, grasped the revolution, promoted production, and triumphantly fulfilled the production plan for the first nine months of the year.

Construction workers have completed 101 percent of their production plan. During this period, the amount of construction completed was 7.6 percent higher than the same period last year. Major construction projects such as the Ferri-Loğoriçan Railway, the Vau i Dejës Hydroelectric Station, and many irrigation projects have made rapid progress.

Workers in the transportation sector have also triumphantly fulfilled their transportation tasks for the first nine months of the year. Among them, railway transportation completed 104.7 percent of the plan, coastal transportation completed 104.6 percent of the plan, ocean transportation completed 120 percent of the plan, and road transportation completed 113 percent of the plan. The workers of the Elbasan Automobile Transportation Company, in order to complete the new transportation tasks, are currently launching a new high tide of the ideological revolution, firmly grasping the revolution, vigorously promoting production, and declaring October as the production assault month.

Workers on the industrial and mining front have also achieved great victories. The "Victory" Chromium Mine in the Peshkopi District, which has always been in the lead in the socialist labor competition, has overfulfilled the mining plan for the first nine months by 2,830 tons and has already begun work for November.
