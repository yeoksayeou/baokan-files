Indian aggressor troops have once again crossed the border to launch armed provocations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has lodged the strongest and most urgent protest. The Chinese government is closely monitoring the developments.

	BEIJING, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- A responsible official from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Satya, the Charge d'Affaires of the Indian Embassy in China, this afternoon to lodge the strongest and most urgent protest against the serious crime of Indian aggressor troops crossing the China-Sikkim border and launching armed provocations today.

	The responsible official pointed out: The Chinese government has received a report from the Chinese border defense forces stating that at 11:45 a.m. on October 1, eight Indian soldiers crossed the China-Sikkim border at the Zola Pass and entered Chinese territory. They first provoked our border patrol personnel with bayonets and then opened fire. At 2:35 p.m., more than 50 Indian aggressor troops, under the cover of heavy artillery fire, launched an attack on the Chinese border defense forces, resulting in casualties among the Chinese border defense forces. The Chinese border defense forces were forced to fight back in self-defense and repelled the Indian troops' attack. As of the time of the protest, the Indian troops had not stopped their artillery fire. The responsible official pointed out: This incident is a new development in the Indian troops' continuous military provocations since September 7 and is another military provocation after the Indian troops' armed invasion on September 11 was repulsed. The Chinese government lodges the strongest and most urgent protest against the Indian government's extremely serious act of aggression. The situation is still developing, and the Chinese government is closely monitoring it. The Chinese government solemnly warns the Indian government that the Indian troops must immediately stop their armed invasions and all military provocations; otherwise, the Indian government will bear full responsibility for all the consequences that may arise.

    印度侵略军再次越过边界进行武装挑衅
    我外交部提出最紧急最强烈抗议
    中国政府正密切注视事态的发展
    新华社一日讯　中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人，今天下午紧急召见印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯，就印度侵略军今天再次越过中国—锡金边界进行武装挑衅的严重罪行，提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。
    第一亚洲司负责人指出：中国政府收到中国边防部队的报告说，十月一日上午十一时四十五分，印度军队八人在卓拉山口越过中国—锡金边界，侵入中国境内，先用刺刀向我边防执勤人员进行挑衅，接着就开枪射击。十四时三十五分，印度侵略军五十余人，在猛烈的炮火掩护下，向中国边防部队发动攻击，造成了中国边防部队的伤亡。中国边防部队被迫自卫还击，打退了印军的进攻。截至抗议时为止印军尚未停止炮击。第一亚洲司负责人指出：这次事件是印军自九月七日以来不断进行军事挑衅的新发展，是印军在九月十一日发动武装侵犯被击退之后的又一次军事挑衅。对于印度政府这一极为严重的侵略罪行，中国政府向印度政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。事态还在发展，中国政府正予以密切注视。中国政府严重警告印度政府，印度军队必须立即停止武装侵犯和一切军事挑衅，否则，由此而产生的一切后果，必须由印度政府承担全部责任。
