The Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the August 18 Joint Committee of the Party, Government, and Mass Organizations in Qinghai Province has achieved excellent results after nearly 20 days of study. This study class was organized according to the "three-in-one" format and military discipline requirements. The class used Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" as the most powerful ideological weapons, took the People's Liberation Army as an example, promoted the "Three-Eight Style," and insisted on the "Four Firsts." This significantly advanced the ideological revolution of the participants and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. This study class has made new explorations in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre education policy. After this period of study, as some comrades have said, "There has been a significant change in the depths of our souls." The gains are enormous.

Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of cadres in Qinghai Province have undergone rigorous tests in more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," and to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they brought their experiences and lessons from the past year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the issues of revolutionary great alliance, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their units. They actively participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class. During the study, they learned Chairman Mao's latest instructions sentence by sentence and word by word, repeatedly studying and applying them. They used the principle of "completely and thoroughly serving the people" as a mirror to measure and compare their actions over the past year in the Cultural Revolution. Former Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, Yan Haikuan, said in his self-criticism, "I followed Chairman Mao's teachings for more than 20 years during the war. I always followed his instructions to the letter. After liberation, my position and life changed. In this unprecedented Cultural Revolution, I followed the bourgeois reactionary line, deviated from Chairman Mao's teachings, and made many mistakes. All the mistakes were because I did not listen to Chairman Mao's words. All the hatred was because of the character 'self.'"

Everyone's experiences and lessons can be summed up in one point: we must be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; deviating from Mao Zedong Thought will inevitably lead to mistakes. Through the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, and through self-criticism, everyone deeply realized: as long as the character 'self' occupies a place in one's mind, one will fall behind in politics and will not keep up with Mao Zedong Thought. This further greatly inspired everyone's unlimited faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They studied Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm. From the bottom of their hearts, they made a vow: to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to follow him to the end, to study to the end, and to change to the end; to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions; to replace the character 'self' with the character 'public.'

With the Criticism of Revisionism and Self-Criticism as the Main Task, Smash the Character 'Self' and Establish the Character 'Public'

The Party, Government, and Mass Organizations' Mao Zedong Thought study class always took "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the main task, firmly grasped the principle of educating and liberating oneself, and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to examine and criticize oneself, carrying out self-revolution in the depths of one's soul, smashing the character 'self' and establishing the character 'public.' At the beginning of the class, many comrades came with various thoughts. Some comrades brought their self-criticisms to report; some comrades thought they were old revolutionaries and had fought against the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party for more than a year, so there was no character 'self' left; some comrades thought they had few characters 'self' and nothing to criticize, mainly coming to see others criticize their 'self'; and some comrades even came to criticize others' 'self.' The class first let everyone bring these active thoughts, repeatedly study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and take the "Old Five Articles" as a motto to learn. They compared what Chairman Mao said with what they did, found the gaps in their thoughts, and strictly required themselves according to Chairman Mao's teachings. On this basis, they carried out heart-to-heart talks, exchanged language recordings, and invited the PLA comrades participating in the study class to share their experiences of transforming their worldview through self-criticism. This greatly inspired the comrades' enthusiasm for self-revolution. A leader of a revolutionary organization said before entering the study class that he always thought he had revolutionized early and had no character 'self' in his thoughts. After studying, he said excitedly after comparing with Mao Zedong Thought, "I not only have the character 'self,' but it is very serious. In the matter of cadres, I did not want them to stand out. If they did not stand out, you would listen to me, but if they stood out and combined, I would have to listen to him. Does the Cultural Revolution have to go on for more than a year, and I still have to be led by him? Because of selfishness, I did not want the cadres who made mistakes to stand out." The political instructor of a revolutionary organization in the provincial committee's organs said in the meeting, "In the past, I always thought our team was the earliest to rebel and had the greatest merit, and the alliance should be based on me. Later, when the election situation changed, I was not satisfied. Today, I want to smash this brother organization, and tomorrow, I want to overthrow that brother organization, arrogant and self-centered, thinking I am the best. If I do not change these selfish thoughts, I will definitely go to the opposite side."

Under Chairman Mao's great call to criticize and repudiate revisionism, everyone fiercely criticized the character 'self' and further realized that without criticizing and repudiating the character 'self,' the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution could not be carried out thoroughly. Without eliminating the character 'self,' capitalism would have the possibility of restoring at any time. Because of criticizing the character 'self,' the thought of serving the people was generally strengthened. Some comrades said, "In the past, I just wanted to struggle, criticize, and disperse. Now, I want to do more for the people." Because of criticizing the character 'self,' everyone felt that although some achievements had been made in the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in various units, they were still far behind the requirements of the situation. The most prominent manifestation was that they were not daring to let the cadres who made mistakes but were willing to correct them work boldly. Through the study, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, examined their wrong understandings and selfish thoughts in dealing with the cadre issue and expressed their willingness to comprehensively and historically view the cadres who made mistakes, to sincerely help them recognize and correct their mistakes, and to welcome them to stand out and revolutionize. Now, eight bureau-level units in the entire system have begun to establish revolutionary committees. The original list of members of the revolutionary committee of the provincial party school was only a combination of two, without revolutionary leading cadres. Therefore, it could not be established. Now, the leading cadres participating in the study class, after the study, have done a good job of self-examination and obtained the understanding and support of the revolutionary rebels, effectively promoting the formation of the three-in-one combination. Originally, all the cadres above the section level in the provincial federation of trade unions were all put aside. After the study, most of the cadres have already or are about to stand out. At present, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the provincial-level Party, Government, and Mass Organizations system in Qinghai is getting better and better, and the tide of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination is forming.

Promote the "Three-Eight Style" and Insist on the "Four Firsts"

Chairman Mao called for learning from the People's Liberation Army nationwide, especially with the deepening of the support-the-army-and-love-the-people movement, taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, and comprehensively learning from the People's Liberation Army to strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletarian revolutionary rebels has become everyone's most urgent requirement. This study class, with the participation of PLA comrades, provided good conditions for everyone to learn from the People's Liberation Army.

Learning from the People's Liberation Army, the most fundamental thing is to learn their deep class feelings of being unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and their advanced experience of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. PLA comrades directly participated in the leadership of the study class work, especially giving lectures on the study of the "Old Three Articles" and sharing experiences of transforming their worldview through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works for each class. Everyone reflected, "No matter how much you study, the most important thing is to learn from the People's Liberation Army's loyalty to Chairman Mao." The organizational form of the study class was also organized in military-style classes, platoons, and companies, with each class having a political instructor, all of whom were PLA comrades. The military and civilians ate, lived, studied, and criticized and repudiated revisionism together.

At the beginning of the class, a common problem in each class was that many comrades could not correctly treat themselves, could not listen to different opinions, and could not accept criticism from the masses. The PLA comrades then studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with everyone, shared their learning experiences, helped improve their understanding, and corrected their attitudes. With the help of the PLA comrades, everyone stood up to examine their own arrogance, self-righteousness, and detachment from the masses, and revealed the character 'self' in the depths of their souls. The PLA comrades in the study class also actively carried out ideological and political work with heart-to-heart talks as the main task, fully played the role of political instructors, and mobilized everyone to do ideological and political work. This quickly launched a wave of doing ideological and political work throughout the class, and heart-to-heart talks became the norm. Everyone found each other to talk, actively examined their own selfish thoughts. The more they talked, the deeper their feelings became, and many old difficult problems were easily solved. Everyone deeply felt that in the past, many problems were difficult to solve and there was no unity, all because they did not grasp ideological and political work, everyone's thoughts did not meet, opinions were not expressed face to face, and they kept accounts of each other. Over time, they formed knots. In the future, they must pay attention to strengthening ideological and political work, express opinions face to face, and only "cancel accounts" without "keeping accounts."

Because the PLA comrades in the study class took the lead in everything and set an example, everyone's organizational discipline and labor outlook have been greatly enhanced.

    西宁地区毛泽东思想学习班效果显著
    学习班以毛主席最新指示和“老五篇”为最强大的思想武器，以解放军为榜样，大兴三八作风，坚持四个第一，大大促进了学员的思想革命化，革命大联合和革命三结合的热潮正在形成。
    本报讯　青海省党政群系统八·一八联委会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，经过近二十天的学习，收到很好的效果。这个学习班，是按照“三结合”的形式和军事化的要求组织起来的。学习班以毛主席最新指示和“老五篇”为最强大的思想武器，以解放军为榜样，大兴三八作风，坚持四个第一，大大促进了学员的思想革命化，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。这个学习班在贯彻执行毛主席的干部教育路线上，进行了新的探索。经过这一段的学习，正象有些同志说的：“在灵魂深处起了很大的变化。”收获是巨大的。
    无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想
    青海省的无产阶级革命派和广大干部，在一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，经受了严峻的考验。为了响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，他们带着一年多来无产阶级文化大革命中正反两面的经验教训，带着革命大联合、革命三结合和本单位斗批改中的问题，积极投入了毛泽东思想学习班的学习。学习中，他们对毛主席的最新指示逐段逐句逐字地学，反复学，反复用，以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务作镜子，衡量、对照一年多来自己在文化大革命中走过的路程。原中共青海省委办公厅机要局副局长阎海宽同志在检查中，沉痛地说：“我跟毛主席革命二十多年，在战争的年代里，对于毛主席他老人家的教导，总是事事照办，句句照办。解放后，地位变了，生活变了。在这次史无前例的文化大革命中，执行了资产阶级反动路线，背离了毛主席的教导，犯了许多错误。千错万错，就错在没有听毛主席的话。千恨万恨，就恨在一个‘私’字上。”大家的经验教训，归结到一点，就是一定要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想；背离了毛泽东思想就一定要犯错误。通过活学活用毛主席著作，通过自我批评，大家深深地认识到：头脑里只要让“私”字占了位置，就会在政治上落后，就会跟不上毛泽东思想。这就进一步大大激发了大家对我们伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的阶级感情。他们如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。大家从内心里发出誓言：要永远忠于毛主席，跟到老，学到老，改到底；永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事；把“私”字换成“公”字。
  以斗私批修为纲，大破私字，大立公字
    党政群毛泽东思想学习班，始终以“斗私，批修”为纲，紧紧掌握自己教育自己，自己解放自己的原则，用毛泽东思想为武器，对照检查自己，开展自我革命，在灵魂深处摆战场，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。学习班开学时，有不少同志是带着各种各样的想法来学习的。有的同志是带着检讨书来报到；有的同志认为自己是老造反派，和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派冲杀了一年多，还有什么“私”字？有的同志认为自己的“私”字不多，没有什么好斗的，主要是来看别人斗“私”的；甚至还有的同志就是为斗别人的“私”字来的。学习班首先让大家带着这些活思想，反复地活学活用毛主席的最新指示，把“老五篇”作为座右铭来学，看看毛主席是怎样说的，再照照自己是怎样做的，找出思想上的差距，用毛主席的教导严格要求自己。在这一基础上，又开展了谈心互助，赠送语录的活动。同时，还请参加学习班的解放军同志，向大家介绍自己如何通过斗私改造世界观的体会。这样一来，大大激发了同志们自我革命的积极性。一个革命组织的负责人，在进学习班之前，一直以为自己造反早，思想上没有“私”字。经过学习，用毛泽东思想一对照，他激动地说：“我不仅有私字，而且很严重。在干部问题上，我就不愿意让他们站出来。站不出来，你们听我的，站出来结合了，我就得听他的，难道文化大革命搞了一年多，我还得受他的领导吗？由于私心作怪，就不愿让犯了错误的干部站出来。”原省委机关一个造反派组织的政治指导员在会上亮私时说：“过去我总认为我们队造反最早，功劳最大，联合要以我为主。后来一选举情况变了，我就不服气。今天要砸烂这个兄弟组织，明天要冲垮那个兄弟组织，骄傲自大，老子天下第一。我这些私心不改，一定要走向自己的反面。”大家在毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召下狠斗了“私”字，进一步认识到，不斗倒“私”字，无产阶级文化大革命就搞不彻底。不把“私”字铲除，资本主义就有随时复辟的可能。由于斗了“私”字，为人民服务的思想普遍增强了。有的同志说：“我过去想斗批走，斗批散。现在，一心想为人民做出更多的贡献。由于斗了“私”字，大家感到各单位在革命大联合和革命三结合方面，虽然取得了一些成绩，但还远远落后于形势的要求。突出地表现在，对一些犯了错误而又愿意改正错误的干部，还不敢大胆放手让他们工作。通过学习，一些革命群众组织的负责人，按照毛主席的最新指示，检查了自己在对待干部问题上的错误认识和私心杂念，表示要全面地历史地看待犯错误的干部，要热诚地帮助他们认识错误，改正错误，欢迎他们站出来革命。现在，全系统已有八个厅一级的单位着手建立革命委员会。省委党校原来革命委员会成员的名单，只是两结合，没有革命领导干部。因此迟迟不能建立。现在参加学习班的领导干部，经过学习以后，思想检查很好，得到了革命造反派的谅解和支持，有效地促进三结合的形成。省总工会原来处以上的干部都一律靠边站。经过学习以后，绝大部分干部已经或即将站出来。目前，青海省级党政群系统无产阶级文化大革命的形势，越来越好，革命大联合和革命三结合的热潮正在形成。
      大兴三八作风，坚持四个第一
    毛主席号召，全国都要学习解放军，特别是随着拥军爱民运动的深入开展，以解放军为榜样，全面地向解放军学习，加强无产阶级革命造反派的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，已成了大家最迫切的要求。这个学习班由于有解放军同志参加，就为大家学习解放军提供了良好的条件。
    学习解放军，最根本的就是学习他们无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的深厚的阶级感情，学习他们活学活用毛主席著作的先进经验。解放军同志直接参加对学习班工作的领导，特别是以班为单位，都请解放军同志作了学习“老三篇”的辅导报告，和活学活用毛主席著作改造世界观的经验介绍。大家反映：“千学习，万学习，最重要的是学习解放军忠于毛主席的一颗红心。”学习班的组织形式，也是按军事化的班、排、连组织的，各班都设有政治指导员，由解放军同志担任。军民同吃、同住、同学习、同斗私批修。
    开学之初，各班普遍存在的一个问题是，许多同志不能正确地对待自己，听不得不同意见，接受不了群众批评。解放军同志便和大家一起学习《为人民服务》，介绍自己学习体会，帮助提高认识，端正态度。经过解放军同志的帮助，大家纷纷起来检查自己居功骄傲，唯我独革，脱离群众的错误思想，亮出了灵魂深处的“私”字。解放军同志在学习班里，还大力开展以谈心为主的思想政治工作，充分发挥政治指导员的作用，发动人人作政治思想工作。这样很快就在全班掀起了大做政治思想工作的热潮，互相谈心成风。你找我谈，我找你谈，主动检查自己的私心杂念。越谈感情越深，许多老大难的问题迎刃而解。大家深有体会地说：过去许多问题难办，闹不团结，就是没有抓政治思想工作，大家思想不见面，有意见不当面讲，彼此“记账”，久而久之结成了疙瘩，今后一定要重视加强政治思想工作，有意见当面说，只“销账”不“记账”。
    由于学习班的解放军同志处处带头，以身作则，现在大家的组织纪律性和劳动观点大大增强了。
