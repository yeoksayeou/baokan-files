Longshan revolutionary masses, revolutionary people, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the province, totaling 10,000, held a grand rally in the rain today to give the warmest welcome to the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The rally was filled with the atmosphere of unity and struggle between the peoples of China and Vietnam. In the center of the stage hung portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

When delegation head Nguyen Van Dan and other Vietnamese comrades arrived at the venue, the entire audience warmly applauded to welcome them.

Li Yuan, Hua Guofeng, Zhang Bosen, and other responsible comrades from the preparatory committee of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and local military units attended the welcoming rally. The meeting began with the majestic song "The East Is Red." Both on and off the stage, everyone recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world, we should have courage to fight, not be afraid of difficulties and press on. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be routed."

Li Yuan, in his speech, extended the warmest welcome to the Vietnamese comrades from South Vietnam who had just returned from visiting Chairman Mao's hometown of Shaoshan. He said, friends from the five continents of the world, with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have been continuously visiting Shaoshan. This is to learn Mao Zedong Thought, draw revolutionary strength, and this is a great encouragement to us.

Li Yuan excitedly said, Chairman Mao recently personally inspected Hunan, giving extremely important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan. The proletarian revolutionary factions in the entire province have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and taking Chairman Mao's latest instructions "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism" as the guideline. They are now launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Li Yuan said, the people of Hunan, like all the people of China, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and are determined to be the strong backing of the Vietnamese people.

In the midst of warm applause, delegation head Nguyen Van Dan spoke. He enthusiastically praised the people of Hunan, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, for not disappointing the expectations of beloved Chairman Mao and for making extremely outstanding contributions in socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said, we personally feel the deep friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. The unbreakable combat unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China will stand firm like pines and cypresses, enduring any storms and rains, and will last forever.

Delegation head Nguyen Van Dan reported to the attendees on the great victories achieved by the people of North and South Vietnam in their united struggle against American aggression for national salvation. He pointed out that the Vietnamese people are fearless of sacrifice. No matter if the battle lasts five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, we are determined to hold our guns firmly, advance victoriously, fight harder, and fight more accurately, until we achieve the peaceful reunification of our country.

Nguyen Van Dan said, the people of South Vietnam are now more united than ever. We will highly carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism and are determined to fight the war of resistance against American aggression to a thorough victory.
