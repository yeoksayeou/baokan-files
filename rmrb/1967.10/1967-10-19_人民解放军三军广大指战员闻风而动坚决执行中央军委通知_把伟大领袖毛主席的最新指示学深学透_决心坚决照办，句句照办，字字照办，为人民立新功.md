The People's Liberation Army's three services' broad cadres and fighters swiftly act on the Central Military Commission's notice to thoroughly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely implement them, word for word, letter for letter, and strive to achieve new victories for the people.

	Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: The great leader Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspection of the North China, Central South, and East China regions have greatly inspired and encouraged the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces. In recent days, the entire military has been studying and discussing Chairman Mao's important instructions with the greatest enthusiasm and speed. Simultaneously, with the highest level of awareness and the most effective measures, they are implementing and executing Chairman Mao's instructions. After the Central Military Commission issued a notice calling on all personnel to immediately launch a movement to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the cadres and fighters held grand meetings and discussions again, determined to concentrate their efforts and time, making the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions the most central task at present, placing it above everything, higher than everything, heavier than everything, and before everything. They will thoroughly study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely carry them out, word for word, letter for letter.

	During the high tide of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the People's Liberation Army's various levels of leadership organs and leading cadres have swiftly acted, taking the lead in studying and implementing. The General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, National Defense Science Commission, National Defense Industry Office, and the Party Committees of the Navy and Air Force all held meetings overnight to study and discuss Chairman Mao's important instructions and made decisions or issued notices, requiring subordinate units to seriously study and resolutely implement them. The Party Committees and leadership organs of the Second Artillery, Engineering Corps, Armored Corps, Signal Corps, Chemical Defense Corps, Artillery Corps, and Railway Corps all held oath-taking meetings and mobilization meetings. The Beijing, Jinan, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Kunming units, and the Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia Military Districts also swiftly held Party Committee meetings, political work meetings, and telephone conferences to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the oath-taking meeting held in the Beijing Garrison District, attended by over ten thousand people, Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi gave an important speech. The cadres and fighters attending the meeting pointed out that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the highest mobilization order for the current proletarian cultural revolution and the greatest driving force to push the proletarian cultural revolution to a new stage. At the meeting of the Air Force Party Committee and the political work meetings held in Jinan and Lanzhou, the leading cadres present unanimously pointed out that the Central Military Commission's important notice is correct: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a great historical document of Marxism-Leninism, a comprehensive and profound summary of the proletarian cultural revolution over the past year, a beacon guiding the entire Party, nation, and military to forge ahead, and the newest and most powerful ideological weapon to ensure the thorough victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. They are determined to lead the way in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, word for word, letter for letter, and implement them in action. The revolutionary cadres of the General Political Department, at a solemn gathering, expressed their determination to achieve new victories for the people in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	In various units, from barracks to outposts, from coastal defenses to the borders, there has been a surge of excitement in recent days. Officers, soldiers, workers, and family members, with deep feelings of love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Chairman Mao, have repeatedly studied and held discussions and exchanges. The cadres and fighters of a certain unit in the Wuhan Army deeply understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions the more they studied. They deeply realized that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are brilliant and true in every word and sentence. The cadres and fighters of a certain unit in the Shenyang Army, during their study, linked the current excellent situation of the proletarian cultural revolution with their personal experiences and the practice of the cultural revolution, deeply feeling Chairman Mao's brilliance and greatness. They said: We must seriously study, resolutely implement, enthusiastically propagate, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The soldiers of the 6th Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison District, who guard Chairman Mao day and night, reviewed their growth process during the study activities. This company has been rated as a Four-Good Company for six consecutive years and has cultivated a large number of outstanding soldiers. They said with revolutionary enthusiasm: Sailing the sea relies on the helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. We have achieved one victory after another and made continuous progress and growth, all thanks to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with deep class feelings and many soldiers could recite Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word and implemented them in action.

	During this study high tide, the broad cadres and fighters repeatedly studied and discussed Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions on fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, further promoting revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and setting up study classes. The cadres and fighters of the unit where the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Nian Siyang, is located, linked their work and thoughts during the study, carried out the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism in depth, and were determined to be like Nian Siyang, with high standards and strict requirements, self-consciously revolutionizing and overthrowing and exposing the "selfishness." The broad cadres and fighters executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in Guilin, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, summarized the experiences of the "three supports and two militaries" work, promoting local revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The leading cadres of a certain unit in the Zhejiang Army also went deep into the grassroots, together with the company cadres and fighters, took the lead in exposing their thoughts and jointly fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism. They said: We resolutely respond to the call of the Central Military Commission, thoroughly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and resolutely become models in fighting against selfishness and vanguards in criticizing revisionism. Many units also set up study classes, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to carry out the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism in depth. The three services in Shanghai held various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, where the participating division-level cadres, "three supports and two militaries" personnel, and people's armed department cadres all linked their thoughts and actual situations, studied, checked, and summarized while promoting the various work of the units and the "three supports and two militaries" work to a new level. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class held in a certain unit of the Wuhan Army, the participating cadres first laid out the manifestations of "selfishness," talked about the harm of "selfishness," and listed the crimes of "selfishness," making their hatred for "selfishness" deep. Then, everyone studied the "Three Articles," using Chairman Mao's teachings in the "Three Articles" to examine, measure, and urge themselves, and finally held a mass meeting to share experiences, greatly raising everyone's ideological awareness and bringing the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

	Various units also organized propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, and streets, carrying out extensive propaganda activities to make Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household and person. Recently, a certain unit of the Nanjing Army sent a batch of cadres and fighters to the nearby towns and rural areas to conduct extensive propaganda in the rain. The certain unit of the Chongqing garrison extensively propagated to the masses, and on one day alone, nearly 190,000 people heard Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many companies of the Henan garrison also carried out the activity of writing "red letters" to convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to family members and comrades. The units responsible for the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in various places have, in recent days, together with the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses, propagated, studied, discussed, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They are determined to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.
