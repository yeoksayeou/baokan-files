Chairman Mao Invites the Congolese (Brazzaville) Delegation to Visit Huainan

Prime Minister Numa Azali spoke passionately and warmly in Huainan, expressing his gratitude to Chairman Mao for inviting the delegation to witness the achievements and new heights reached by the Cultural Revolution in Huainan. He said that Chairman Mao wanted them to see how the revolutionary masses split into two factions and then achieved great unity. This demonstrates the deep friendship between China and Congo (Brazzaville).

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 6th - Prime Minister Anbwaizale Numa Azali was delighted to hear about the new achievements of the Cultural Revolution in Huainan when he arrived by special plane to visit Huainan, Anhui Province, this afternoon. He extended warm congratulations to the revolutionary masses of Huainan.

The delegation led by Prime Minister Numa Azali of the National Revolutionary Movement and Government of Congo (Brazzaville) arrived in Huainan, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Yixin. Also accompanying them was Bazanga, the Congolese (Brazzaville) Ambassador to China.

When Prime Minister Numa Azali and other Congolese (Brazzaville) friends arrived in Huainan, the streets were filled with excitement. The revolutionary masses lined up on both sides of the streets, holding high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and beating drums and gongs to warmly welcome the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle in Africa. Prime Minister Numa Azali and other Congolese (Brazzaville) friends also waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," frequently acknowledging the welcoming crowds. The welcoming crowds repeatedly shouted, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville)!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people!"

Prime Minister Numa Azali and the delegation members listened to a report on the progress of the Cultural Revolution in Huainan. That evening, the Huainan municipal leadership held a welcome banquet for the delegation's visit. Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Minister Xu Yixin, and the responsible person for the PLA in Anhui, Luo Xuezheng, as well as local representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction, attended the banquet.

At the banquet, Prime Minister Numa Azali spoke, first expressing his respect to the Government of the People's Republic of China and to Chairman Mao, and thanking Chairman Mao for inviting their delegation to Huainan to personally see the achievements and new heights reached by the proletarian Cultural Revolution here. He said that it was during Chairman Mao's reception of their delegation that the situation of the Cultural Revolution in Huainan was discussed, and it was Chairman Mao who wanted them to see how the revolutionary masses faced difficulties, how they split into two factions, and then how they achieved great unity. This attitude shows the deep friendship and close cooperative relationship between China and Congo (Brazzaville). We also thank the Chinese government for inviting us to meet with representatives from various sectors, to meet and talk with Red Guards, workers, PLA soldiers, and peasants, allowing us to personally see the amazing progress made by the Chinese people in their labor and the Cultural Revolution.

Prime Minister Numa Azali said, "When we came to Huainan, we were especially pleased to hear that you have achieved great unity here. We cannot imagine that the proletarian revolutionary faction would split into two factions. In fact, if the proletariat splits into two factions, it will forget its historical mission: not only to liberate itself but also to liberate all of humanity. Therefore, when we heard comrades talk about achieving great unity here, I think this is very important. If we have any wishes, it is that the proletarian revolutionary faction in Huainan not only should reach the level of production before the Cultural Revolution but also, through the Cultural Revolution, due to the revolutionization of people's thoughts, should surpass the level before the Cultural Revolution."

Prime Minister Numa Azali said, "In fact, your coal production plays an important role in the entire industrial production process. Your construction not only has great significance for building China into a powerful socialist country but also has great significance for the proletariat and oppressed peoples of the world. Because they hope that China will become strong so that they can also become strong with your help. This is exactly what Chairman Mao proposed in his 'Three Articles': serving the people; internationalism—this is mentioned in the article 'In Memory of Norman Bethune'; socialist labor—this is mentioned in the article 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.'

Prime Minister Numa Azali concluded by shouting, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of the People's Republic of China and Congo (Brazzaville)! Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao a long life!"

Prime Minister Numa Azali's passionate and friendly speech repeatedly sparked enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. The representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction of Huainan present at the banquet sincerely thanked Prime Minister Numa Azali for his good wishes.

Xinhua News Agency, October 6th - The delegation led by Anbwaizale Numa Azali, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the National Revolutionary Movement and Prime Minister and Head of Government of Congo (Brazzaville), accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Yixin, departed Beijing by special plane today to visit the south of our country.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Zhou Jianren, and others went to the airport to see off the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends.

At noon, Prime Minister Numa Azali and other Congolese (Brazzaville) friends arrived at the airport by car. A team of Red Guards greeted the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends by reciting the quotations of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Imperialism is most afraid of the awakening of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and of the awakening of the peoples of the world. We must unite to drive American imperialism back to its old home in Asia, Africa, and Latin America." Prime Minister Numa Azali and the Red Guards shook hands warmly one by one.

On the airport, where the national flags of China and Congo (Brazzaville) were flying, a grand farewell ceremony was held. The orchestra played the national anthems of Congo (Brazzaville) and China. Prime Minister Numa Azali, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, inspected the ceremonial troops of the army, navy, air force, and militia and Red Guards.

Subsequently, Prime Minister Numa Azali and other Congolese (Brazzaville) friends circled the field to bid farewell to the thousands of welcoming crowds in the capital. At this time, people held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beat drums and gongs, and shouted slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville)!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people!" warmly seeing off the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends. Prime Minister Numa Azali waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to acknowledge the welcoming crowds.

Today, those who went to the airport to see off the delegation included responsible persons from various government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Diplomatic envoys from various countries also went to the airport to see off the delegation.

Ambassador Bazanga of Congo (Brazzaville) to China accompanied Prime Minister Numa Azali on his visit to the south of our country.

    毛主席邀请刚果（布）代表团访问淮南
    努马扎莱总理在淮南发表热情友好的讲话，感谢毛主席邀请代表团亲眼看一看淮南无产阶级文化大革命的成就和达到的新水平。他说，毛主席要我们看一看革命群众是怎样分成两派的，然后又是怎样实现革命大联合的。这表明中国和刚果（布）之间的深厚友谊。
    新华社合肥六日电　安布鲁瓦斯·努马扎莱总理今天下午乘专机到达安徽省淮南市访问时，听到淮南无产阶级文化大革命取得新成就，感到特别高兴。他向淮南的革命群众表示热烈的祝贺。
    努马扎莱总理率领的刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团是由李先念副总理、外交部副部长徐以新陪同到达淮南的。陪同到达的还有刚果（布）驻中国大使巴赞加。
    当努马扎莱总理和其他刚果（布）朋友到达淮南市时，街头一片欢腾。排列在街道两旁的革命群众高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎来自非洲反帝反殖斗争前线的刚果（布）朋友。努马扎莱总理和其他刚果（布）朋友也挥动《毛主席语录》，频频向欢迎的群众致意。欢迎的群众不断高呼：“中国刚果（布）两国人民的友谊万岁！”“坚决支持刚果（布）人民的反帝反殖斗争！”
    努马扎莱总理和代表团成员听取了关于淮南市文化大革命运动进展的情况。当晚，淮南市领导机关为代表团的访问举行了欢迎宴会。李先念副总理、徐以新副部长、中国人民解放军驻安徽部队负责人娄学政等，以及当地无产阶级革命派代表出席了宴会。
    努马扎莱总理在宴会上讲话，他首先向中华人民共和国政府、向毛主席表示敬意，感谢毛泽东主席邀请他们代表团来淮南亲眼看一看这里无产阶级文化大革命的成就和达到的新水平。他说，正是在毛主席接见我们代表团的时候，谈到淮南的无产阶级文化大革命形势，正是毛主席要我们来看一看革命群众之间有什么样的困难，他们是怎样分成两派的，然后又是怎样实现革命的大联合的。这种态度表明中国和刚果（布）之间的深厚友谊和密切合作关系。我们还感谢中国政府邀请我们同各界代表接触，同红卫兵、工人、人民解放军战士、农民接触交谈，使我们亲眼看到中国人民所进行的劳动和无产阶级文化大革命所取得的惊人进展。
    努马扎莱总理说，我们来到淮南市，在参观的时候，特别高兴地听到你们这里实现了革命大联合。我们不能设想无产阶级革命派会分成两大派。事实上，如果无产者分成两大派，他就会忘记自己的历史使命：不仅要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。所以，当我们听到同志们谈到这里实现了革命大联合，我认为，这是非常重要的。如果讲我们有什么要祝愿的话，那就是淮南无产阶级革命派不仅在生产方面应该达到无产阶级文化大革命以前的水平，而且经过无产阶级文化大革命，由于人的思想革命化，应该超过无产阶级文化大革命以前的水平。
    努马扎莱总理说，实际上，你们生产的煤，在整个工业生产过程中占重要地位。你们的建设不仅对把中国建设成强大的社会主义国家有重大意义，而且对全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民有重大的意义。因为他们希望中国强大起来，以便使他们在你们的援助下也强大起来。这也正是体现了毛主席在“老三篇”著作中提出的三个原则：为人民服务；国际主义——这是在《纪念白求恩》一文中讲的；社会主义劳动——这是在《愚公移山》一文中讲的。
    努马扎莱总理最后高呼：中华人民共和国和刚果（布）两国人民友谊万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆。
    努马扎莱总理热情友好的讲话，不断激起全场热烈的掌声。出席宴会的淮南市无产阶级革命派代表衷心地感谢努马扎莱总理所给予的良好祝愿。
    新华社六日讯　刚果（布）全国革命运动中央委员会第一书记、总理、政府首脑安布鲁瓦斯·努马扎莱率领的刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团，由国务院副总理李先念和外交部副部长徐以新陪同，今天乘专机离开北京，前往我国南方参观访问。
    国务院总理周恩来，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、周建人等，到机场欢送刚果（布）朋友。
    中午十二时，努马扎莱总理和其他刚果（布）朋友乘车到机场。一队红卫兵迎着刚果（布）朋友朗读了伟大领袖毛主席的语录：“帝国主义最怕的是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民觉悟，怕世界各国人民的觉悟。我们要团结起来把美帝国主义从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲赶回它的老家去。”努马扎莱总理和红卫兵一一亲切握手。
    在飘扬着中国和刚果（布）两国国旗的机场上，举行了隆重的欢送仪式。乐队奏刚果（布）和中国国歌。努马扎莱总理由周恩来总理陪同，检阅了陆海空三军和民兵、红卫兵的仪仗队。
    随后，努马扎莱总理和其他刚果（布）朋友，绕场一周，向首都数千欢送群众告别。这时，人们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，高呼“中国刚果（布）两国人民的友谊万岁！”“坚决支持刚果（布）人民反帝反殖的斗争！”等口号，热情地欢送刚果（布）朋友。努马扎莱总理高举《毛主席语录》向欢送群众致意。
