	Raise High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Struggle to Overthrow the Miyamoto Group
	The Leftist Faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Yawata Steel Plant Committee Announces Its Formation
	Praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, Which Has Dealt a Heavy Blow to All Reactionaries and Greatly Inspired the People of the World

	New China News Agency, Tokyo, October 10 – On September 25, Fukunaga Hayato, a revolutionary leftist of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), and representatives of the revolutionary leftists of the Yawata and Koza regions issued a declaration announcing the formal establishment of the Yawata Steel Plant Committee (Leftist Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party. The declaration states that they will resolutely raise the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow the Miyamoto revisionist clique and fight for the liberation of the Japanese people.

	Fukunaga Hayato was originally a member of the JCP Fukuoka Prefectural Committee and the chairman of the Yawata Steel Plant Party Committee. Yawata is the steel center of Japan.

	The declaration points out that the Miyamoto clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, degenerated into revisionism, and taken the shameful path of allying with Soviet revisionism and opposing socialist China.

	The declaration states that the era today is one in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory. This global trend is undeniable, and the law of historical development cannot be changed by any force.

	The declaration points out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is an unprecedented great revolution in human history advancing towards the victory of communism. The great Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has dealt a heavy blow to all reactionaries led by U.S. imperialism and has greatly inspired and encouraged the oppressed peoples and nations.

	The declaration states that people around the world are jubilant over the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They are using Mao Zedong Thought, the guiding ideology of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, as a weapon to strike at U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism.

	The declaration states that the Japanese working class regards Mao Zedong Thought as the highest development of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. They are raising the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to advance the Japanese revolution.

	The declaration exposes the dirty collusion between the Soviet revisionist clique and the Yawata monopoly capitalists, and severely condemns the revisionist crimes of the Miyamoto clique in advocating so-called "peaceful revolution" and "parliamentary road" as well as collaborating with Soviet revisionism in "joint actions." The declaration points out that the Miyamoto revisionist clique's frenzied howls against Mao Zedong Thought show that it is fundamentally opposed to Marxism-Leninism and will be smashed by the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese working class.

    新华社东京十日电　日共革命左派福永卯一和八幡地区、户畑地区的日共革命左派代表，九月二十五日发表宣言，宣布正式成立日本共产党八幡钢厂委员会（左派）。宣言表示，决心高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想红旗，为打倒宫本修正主义集团，为日本人民的解放而奋斗。
    福永卯一原任日共福冈县委委员、八幡钢厂党委会委员长。八幡是日本的钢铁中心。

    宣言指出，在毛泽东思想指导下的中国文化大革命，是向共产主义胜利前进的、人类历史空前未有的伟大的革命。伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，给以美帝国主义为首的一切反动派以沉重的打击，给被压迫人民和被压迫民族以无限鼓舞和激励。
    宣言说，全世界人民为中国的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展而欢欣鼓舞。他们正在以中国文化大革命的指导思想毛泽东思想为武器，打击着美帝国主义和现代修正主义。
    宣言说，日本工人阶级认为毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高发展，他们正在高举着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的旗帜，推进日本革命。
    宣言揭露了苏修集团同八幡垄断资本之间的肮脏勾结，严厉谴责了宫本集团宣扬的所谓“和平革命”和“议会道路”以及同苏修搞“联合行动”的修正主义罪行。宣言指出，宫本修正主义集团反对毛泽东思想的疯狂叫嚣，表明它是从根本上与马克思列宁主义为敌，它必将被日本工人阶级的革命斗争所粉碎。
