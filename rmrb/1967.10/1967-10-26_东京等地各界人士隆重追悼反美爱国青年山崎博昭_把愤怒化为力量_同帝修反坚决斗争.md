Progressive masses' leaders and activists from various organizations in Japan, totaling 500 people, held a grand memorial meeting in Tokyo on the evening of the 23rd to commemorate the patriotic youth Yamazaki Hiroshi, who sacrificed his life in the anti-American struggle. They also expressed their resolve to decisively overthrow the Sato government, which is a lackey of the American imperialists.

The meeting hall was adorned with a banner featuring Chairman Mao's quotation: "All the world's people unite! All the world's people, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys! All the world's people, be courageous and dare to fight, unyielding in the face of difficulties, advancing wave upon wave, then the whole world will definitely be the world of the people." The entire venue was filled with a fighting spirit.

The seven organizations that sponsored this memorial meeting, including the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japan Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers, and the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, strongly condemned the Sato government for acting as a lackey of American imperialism in the Vietnam War. They vehemently opposed the Sato government's attempts to revive Japanese militarism and sabotage people-to-people exchanges between Japan and China. They demanded that the Johnson government immediately and unconditionally return Okinawa to Japan.

The attendees unanimously expressed their determination to turn their immense anger at the Sato government's murder of the patriotic Japanese youth Yamazaki into strength. The meeting adopted a resolution. The resolution pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved decisive victories, making China, the base of world revolution and national liberation struggles, even more solid. The Vietnamese people, as well as the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, inspired by the great thought of Mao Zedong and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are bravely fighting against American imperialism and the reactionaries of their respective countries. The resolution emphasized that the Japanese people must arm themselves with the most powerful anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist ideological weapon—the thought of Mao Zedong—to strengthen their unity, overcome difficulties, and fearlessly sacrifice themselves. They must resolutely fight against American imperialism, the Sato reactionary government, the Soviet revisionists, and the Japanese revisionists. The resolution firmly believes that the final victory will belong to the Japanese people.

After delivering a eulogy at the meeting, the Chairman of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Kurosawa Toshio, along with renowned lawyer Kobayashi Yoshihiro, Chairman of the Japan Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, and the Executive Director of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, Tanaka Shuichiro, addressed the gathering.

Sakamoto emphasized that with the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the thought of Mao Zedong has become even more deeply ingrained in the hearts of the people. In many regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, people are waging armed struggles. Sakamoto called for strengthening the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle and fighting for the independence of the Japanese nation.

The memorial meeting concluded with the singing of the "Internationale."

According to a report from the East China News Agency on the 23rd, more than 400 workers, students, and citizens from Kyoto and Osaka held a memorial meeting in Kyoto on the 21st for the patriotic Japanese youth Yamazaki Hiroshi, who sacrificed his life in the anti-American patriotic struggle. They strongly condemned the Sato government's fascist crime of killing patriotic students.

The memorial meeting hall was adorned with a banner featuring Chairman Mao's quotation: "Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward along the path of their blood!" The hall also displayed large banners with slogans such as "Arm yourself with Mao Zedong Thought and further develop the just struggle against American imperialism and for national independence!"

The Principal of the Osaka Japan-China Friendship Academy, Otsuka Yuzuo, and Professor Inoue Sei from Kyoto University delivered speeches at the memorial meeting.
