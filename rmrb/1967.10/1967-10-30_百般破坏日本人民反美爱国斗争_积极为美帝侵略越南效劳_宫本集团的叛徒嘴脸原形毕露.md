The Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party has been doing everything in its power to sabotage the Japanese people's patriotic struggle against U.S. military bases and actively serving U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

According to the latest issue of the Japanese *Labor Weekly*, the Miyamoto revisionist group recently took the opportunity of supporting the Socialist Party's candidate for the mayor of Tachikawa City to secretly collude with a small clique of right-wing Socialists. They reached a so-called "Socialist-Communist policy agreement" to strike at the patriotic students who actively support the struggle against the U.S. expansion of the Tachikawa base. Their plot is to sabotage the patriotic struggle of the people of Sunagawa Town, which has been intensifying since last year, against the expansion of the Tachikawa base.

Sunagawa Town is adjacent to the U.S. military Tachikawa base. The U.S. military air transport unit stationed at the Tachikawa base is responsible for directly transporting troops and military supplies to the U.S. forces invading Vietnam. For a long time, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries have decided to forcibly seize the land of Sunagawa Town to expand the Tachikawa base's runway to accommodate large jet transport planes. Especially after the U.S. escalated its aggression in Vietnam, the pro-American and traitorous Sato government, following the U.S. imperialists' orders, has been even more ruthless in suppressing the farmers of Sunagawa Town who refuse to hand over their land. However, with the support of the broad masses of patriotic students and workers, the local farmers have been bravely fighting back, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression.

In the face of the surging struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S. expansion of the Tachikawa base, the Miyamoto revisionist group has become a disgraceful accomplice of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. It has repeatedly maliciously slandered the just actions of the Sunagawa Town farmers and patriotic students in blocking the seizure of farmers' land. Using the same vicious methods as the Japanese reactionaries, it has spread rumors and deceived the public, accusing the students' demonstrations of "disrupting the lives of citizens." It has attempted to incite the citizens of Tachikawa City against the farmers of Sunagawa Town, aiming to break the unity between the youth and the local farmers.

The farmers of Sunagawa Town have seen through the traitorous face of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group in the course of the struggle. They have resolutely refused to cooperate with the traitors who have betrayed the anti-American patriotic struggle of the people of Sunagawa Town. They have also exposed the hypocritical face of the Miyamoto revisionist group's so-called support. On May 28 of this year, the Japanese revisionists held a festival-like "meeting" near the Tachikawa base to decorate their facade. At that time, the farmers of Sunagawa Town resolutely refused to attend and returned the so-called "donations" from the Japanese revisionists. The farmers pointed out bluntly: "The revisionists do not genuinely support our struggle. They hold meetings only for their own propaganda. They invite us to attend, treating us as puppets, sitting on the stage, serving as a backdrop for their photos, deceiving the people at home and abroad."

In the face of the people of Sunagawa Town, a small group of isolated Japanese Communist Party revisionists have once again resorted to any means to collude with right-wing social democrats. They attempt to use the method of striking at patriotic youth to sabotage the struggle of the people of Sunagawa Town against the U.S. military's expansion of the base. According to the *Labor Weekly*, this so-called "Socialist-Communist policy agreement," concocted by the Japanese revisionist group, slanders patriotic youth participating in the struggle of Sunagawa Town as a "major obstacle to unified action."

However, the people of Sunagawa Town have long seen through the plots and tricks of the Miyamoto revisionist group. They completely disregard the so-called "Socialist-Communist policy agreement" and are determined to continue the struggle with the broad masses of patriotic students and workers, following their own direction. At the same time, the majority of local Socialist Party members are also extremely dissatisfied with this action of the Japanese revisionists. They firmly demand the abolition of this "agreement."

    百般破坏日本人民反美爱国斗争　积极为美帝侵略越南效劳
    宫本集团的叛徒嘴脸原形毕露
    据新华社东京二十六日电　日共宫本修正主义集团千方百计破坏日本人民反对美军基地的爱国斗争，为美帝国主义侵略越南效劳。
    据最近一期日本《劳动周报》揭露，宫本修正主义集团不久前借支持社会党提出的立川市市长候选人的机会，同一小撮社会党右派秘密勾结，达成一项所谓“社、共政策协定”，打击积极支援反对美国扩建立川基地斗争的爱国学生，阴谋破坏砂川镇人民从去年以来日益高涨的反对扩建立川基地的爱国斗争。
    砂川镇同美军立川基地接壤。驻在立川基地的美军空运部队，担负着直接给侵越美军运送兵员和军需物资的任务。很早以来，美日反动派就决定强占砂川镇的土地，扩展立川基地的飞机跑道，以适应大型喷气式运输机的需要，特别是在美帝扩大侵略越南战争以后，亲美卖国的佐藤政府，秉承美帝的意旨，更加变本加厉地压迫拒绝交出土地的砂川镇农民。但是当地农民在广大爱国学生和工人的支持下坚持英勇斗争，有力地打击了美日反动派，支持了越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    宫本修正主义集团在日益高涨的日本人民反对美国扩建立川基地的斗争中，充当了美日反动派的可耻帮凶。它一次又一次地恶毒诽谤砂川镇农民和爱国学生阻止强占农民土地的正义行动，并且用日本反动派同样的恶毒手法，造谣惑众，诬蔑青年学生的游行示威“干扰了市民生活”，妄图挑拨立川市民和砂川镇农民的关系，破坏青年学生和当地农民的团结。
    砂川镇农民，在斗争中看清了日共修正主义集团的叛徒面目，坚决拒绝与出卖砂川镇人民反美爱国斗争的叛徒合作，并且戳穿了日修宫本集团假支持的伪善面目。今年五月二十八日，日修为了装饰门面，在立川基地附近举行了一次庙会式的“集会”。当时，砂川镇农民坚决拒绝出席，并且退回了日修给他们的所谓“捐款”。农民们一针见血地指出：“修正主义者不是真心支持我们的斗争。他们开会，只是为了给自己做宣传。他们请我们出席，是把我们当成傀儡，坐在台上，给他们当照相的布景，欺骗国内外人民。”
    在砂川镇人民面前，陷于孤立的一小撮日共修正主义分子，这次又不择手段地与右翼社会民主主义者勾结起来，妄图用打击爱国青年学生的手法，破坏砂川镇人民反对美军扩建基地的斗争。据《劳动周报》报道，这个由日修集团一手炮制的所谓“社、共政策协定”，诬蔑爱国青年参加砂川镇的斗争，是“统一行动的重大障碍”。
    但是，砂川镇人民早已识破了宫本修正主义集团的阴谋诡计，他们完全蔑视所谓的“社、共政策协定”，决心继续和广大爱国学生和工人团结一起，按着自己的方向，进行斗争。同时，大多数地方的社会党员，对日修这一行径也极为不满，他们坚决要求废除这个“协定”。
