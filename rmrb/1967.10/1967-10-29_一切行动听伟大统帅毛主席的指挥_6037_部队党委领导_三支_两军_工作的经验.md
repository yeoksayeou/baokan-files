**Editor's Note of the People's Liberation Army Daily:** The 6037 Unit has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stood firmly on the side of the leftist masses, and established new merits for the people. Their experiences are worth learning from.

The most important aspect of the 6037 Unit's experience in supporting the left is that they "follow closely" and "rely on the masses."

"Follow closely" means to closely follow Chairman Mao, closely follow Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. Every instruction from Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao is carried out to the letter, step by step. When encountering problems, they promptly report and seek instructions.

"Rely on the masses" means to rely on the genuine proletarian revolutionaries, to rely on the masses, to consult with the masses on matters, to conduct extensive investigations and research, to firmly believe that the most intelligent and talented are the masses with the most practical experience, and to humbly be the students of the masses.

In this way, the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work is ensured.

The "three supports, two militaries" work is an extremely glorious and arduous political task given to our army by our great leader Chairman Mao. Units that have achieved remarkable results in supporting the left should be humble and cautious, not arrogant or impatient; units that have made mistakes should be brave in correcting them, lighten their load and move forward, and humbly learn from units that have done a good job in supporting the left. Units supporting the left in the same area should learn from each other, help each other, support each other, and advance shoulder to shoulder. We must fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, "follow closely and rely on the masses," and do an even better job in supporting the left, never disappointing the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations for us.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 6037 Unit has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supported the proletarian revolutionaries, and achieved double victories in the "three supports, two militaries" and the revolutionary construction of the unit, establishing new merits for the people. Recently, they have enthusiastically responded to and seriously studied the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, summarizing the experiences of the previous stage of supporting the left. The unit's Party Committee believes that to do a good job in supporting the left, the most important thing is to take "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and to achieve "following closely and relying on the masses": to follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely, with all actions following the command of the great leader Chairman Mao; to rely closely on the genuine proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, to rely closely on the broad cadres and soldiers of the unit, to learn from the masses, and to learn from the masses. This is the fundamental principle for doing a good job in supporting the left, and it is also the fundamental principle for the revolutionary construction of our army.

**Carrying Out Chairman Mao's Instructions to the Letter, Step by Step**

Vice Chairman Lin said: "In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of our great commander-in-chief, we should listen well to the words of our commander-in-chief—Chairman Mao. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!"

Over the past year, the 6037 Unit has been able to do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work and establish new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, precisely because of their absolute faith and unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the unit's Party Committee has had a varying degree of understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions. However, they firmly remember one principle: to absolutely believe in Chairman Mao, to be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, to firmly believe in and follow every instruction from Chairman Mao to the letter and step by step, and to carry out and execute them one hundred percent. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards attacked society, and initially, they did not approve. However, after seeing Chairman Mao receive the Red Guards several times and firmly support the revolutionary youngsters, they decisively changed their views and stood with the revolutionary youngsters. When the "Sixteen Points" drafted and issued by Chairman Mao were published, they used this great document as a weapon, carefully analyzed the revolutionary situation in Qingdao, recognized the true face of the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, and firmly supported the proletarian revolutionaries in their rebellion. In September of last year, the handful of power-holders within the Party in Qingdao, in an attempt to save themselves from imminent doom, spread malicious rumors and viciously attacked the revolutionary leader Comrade Wang Xiaoyu. At that time, the unit's Party Committee did not know Comrade Wang Xiaoyu well. After seeing Chairman Mao's instructions on the Qingdao issue, they firmly believed that Chairman Mao's instructions were absolutely correct and decisively stood with Comrade Wang Xiaoyu, fully supporting Comrade Wang Xiaoyu and the proletarian revolutionaries in Qingdao. On January 22 of this year, the proletarian revolutionaries in Qingdao, under the leadership of Comrade Wang Xiaoyu, seized power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. The unit's Party Committee made a decision that night to support this seizure of power. However, overnight, the entire city was plastered with big-character posters opposing the seizure of power. There was much discussion within the unit. Faced with this situation, the Party Committee organized a large number of cadre staff to conduct extensive investigations in various mass organizations in Qingdao. Then, they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle with the situations they had investigated, using class analysis to conduct heated discussions. Finally, everyone agreed: the party, government, finance, and cultural powers in Qingdao had indeed been usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, and this power should be seized back; the participants in the seizure of power were proletarian revolutionaries, and this power was seized correctly. Once the understanding was unified, the actions became resolute. Therefore, in supporting the seizure of power struggle, despite being cursed, besieged, and even beaten, the unit remained unwavering and stood firm to the end, supporting the proletarian revolutionaries in Qingdao at the most critical and crucial moment.

**Promptly Reporting to Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters**

The 6037 Unit's Party Committee realized that although they strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, their ideological awakening and level of understanding are inevitably limited. Only our great leader Chairman Mao stands the highest, sees the farthest, and is the most foresighted; only Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters can grasp the overall situation, see through the development trend of the movement, and handle various problems in the most accurate and appropriate manner. Therefore, when encountering major problems in the "three supports, two militaries" work, they always resolutely and promptly report to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

They believe that reporting and seeking instructions is not just a matter of superior-subordinate relationships and work procedures, but also a matter of absolute belief in and high responsibility for the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. On January 22 of this year, after the unit's Party Committee received news of the proletarian revolutionaries in Qingdao seizing power, they immediately held an emergency meeting to study and decide, actively supporting the seizure of power while reporting the situation and their action plan to their superiors. After receiving the instructions from the Central Cultural Revolution Group, they immediately printed and distributed them to the unit, conveying them to all cadres, soldiers, staff, and family members, ensuring that everyone knew about it. The instructions from the Central Cultural Revolution Group conveyed Chairman Mao's voice, bringing great encouragement and strength to the broad cadres and soldiers of this unit.

Reporting and seeking instructions is not about shirking responsibility or passing on difficulties, but a revolutionary need and a discipline of the proletarian revolution. In the process of supporting the left, they promptly report the situation and seek instructions on the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the Party's policies and guidelines, as well as the handling of some major issues, using methods such as telephone, telegram, letter, dispatching people, or responsible comrades going in person for face-to-face discussions. Before reporting and seeking instructions, they conduct thorough investigations and research, proposing their own views and plans for reference by their superiors. The unit's supporting left forces sent to the Changwei area of Shandong Province reported in detail to the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Comrade Wang Xiaoyu on every relatively large action plan to open up the situation, and only executed after approval. In this way, they avoided detours and mistakes. They felt that in the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary situation in various regions developed unevenly, with some progressing faster and others slower, and with some reversals being large and others small. Therefore, strengthening reporting and seeking instructions, promptly conveying the situation from below to above and from above to below, not only facilitated the lower levels in following the upper levels but also facilitated the upper levels in understanding the situation below and timely strengthening leadership.

Reporting and seeking instructions is also a way to learn from superiors and receive active education. Every time they receive instructions from their superiors after reporting and seeking instructions, they carefully study and deeply understand them, seeing how the leadership handles matters according to Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies and guidelines, and thinking about how they should handle matters according to Chairman Mao's teachings and the instructions of their superiors. Through "seeing and thinking," they continuously deepen their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously correct their course of advancement, and accelerate their steps in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

**Following Chairman Mao's Teachings, Closely Relying on the Left and the Broad Revolutionary Masses**

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: the masses are the true heroes. The 6037 Unit's Party Committee deeply felt from practice that revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao the most, love Mao Zedong Thought the most, and understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the most. To closely follow the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, one must closely rely on the left and the broad revolutionary masses.

In March of this year, a conservative organization in a factory in Qingdao caused a lot of trouble. The responsible comrades of the unit's leading organ personally led three cadre staff to this factory. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in and relying on the masses, mobilizing the revolutionary masses to do political and ideological work for the deceived masses. They repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two types of contradictions to some people, eliminating their revengeful sentiments, and together doing political and ideological work for the deceived masses. As a result, the conservative organization in this factory quickly disintegrated, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses. Through this practice, they personally experienced the importance of doing work for the deceived masses in supporting leftist organizations and strengthening leftist organizations, and more deeply understood the great truth taught by Chairman Mao: "All issues of an ideological nature and all issues of debate within the people can only be resolved through democratic methods, only through methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved through coercive and forced methods." They summarized their experiences and guided their work in supporting the left. Later, when the unit intervened in the Cultural Revolution in the Changwei area of Shandong Province, facing the situation where conservative forces were dominant, they adopted the same method, relying on the broad leftist masses to launch a powerful political offensive against the conservative organizations, and conducting meticulous political and ideological work for the deceived masses. In a short period, they turned around the situation in this area.

In their work of supporting the left, in addition to closely relying on the broad leftist masses, they also closely relied on the broad cadres and soldiers of the unit, following the mass line in handling matters, letting everyone come up with ideas and solutions, respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses, and giving full play to collective wisdom. For various major actions in supporting the left, they handed them over to the masses of the leading organ and the cadres and soldiers executing the task of supporting the left, fully discussing and fully fermenting. If there were differences in understanding, they would bring the problems to study Chairman Mao's teachings, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify everyone's understanding. This made the unit from top to bottom more firmly united on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with everyone looking in the same direction, thinking in the same way, and exerting their efforts in the same way, making the "three supports, two militaries" work better and better.

**Using Mao Zedong Thought as a Guide, Continuously Summarizing Experiences**

The "three supports, two militaries" work is a brand-new thing. To understand this thing and do this work well, one must use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide and continuously summarize experiences and lessons. The 6037 Unit's Party Committee deeply felt from practice that for some of Chairman Mao's teachings, they temporarily did not understand or did not fully understand, and thus did not carry them out consciously. Only by continuously summarizing the experiences and lessons from practice can one turn non-understanding into understanding and non-consciousness into consciousness.

Soon after entering the work of supporting the left, the responsible comrades of the unit led a working group to conduct investigations and research in four counties and several factories, understanding the situation, discovering problems, summarizing experiences and lessons, and strengthening the leadership of the work of supporting the left. Since this year, they have gathered the cadres and soldiers supporting the left four times, using the methods of concentrated training and lectures to widely exchange experiences and lessons in supporting the left. Everyone brought the problems from practice, compared them with Chairman Mao's instructions, seeing what was done correctly and in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, and what was done incorrectly and not in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, thereby deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and enhancing their consciousness of execution. A unit of this unit supported the left in a certain county. From the beginning, they firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary faction, strongly supporting the leftist masses. The conservative organization was basically in a state of self-dissolution. However, at this relatively smooth time, they were not calm enough, neglected policies and strategies, and supported some of the revolutionary faction's impatient actions, resulting in some difficulties in doing work for the deceived masses. After the incident, they sat down and seriously summarized this lesson, deeply feeling the great significance of Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the Party." Using simple and rough methods for the deceived masses seemed "fast," but in reality, it was "slow"; it seemed to be helping the left, but in reality, it was helping the wrong way. Through this summary, they raised everyone's consciousness of doing work for the deceived masses.

Continuously summarizing experiences and lessons can lead to discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. In April of this year, some erroneous tendencies such as anarchism, factionalism, and small-groupism appeared within some revolutionary mass organizations, hindering the great alliance of the revolution. How to solve these problems? The responsible comrades of the unit, with this problem in mind, conducted investigations for three weeks. One day, he went to the Qingdao Bicycle Factory to hold a meeting and found that the comrades supporting the left in this factory used the method of organizing Mao Zedong Thought study teams to help the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations study Chairman Mao's works, solving the problem of unity within the factory's revolutionary mass organizations. The responsible comrades of the unit then summarized their experiences with them and promoted them to the supporting left forces throughout the city, greatly promoting the great alliance of the revolution and the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the city.

**Striving for the Transformation of Worldview, Establishing New Merits for the People**

The 6037 Unit's Party Committee deeply felt from a year of practice that to achieve "following closely and relying on the masses," one must take "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key and strive to eliminate the "self" in one's mind. Only by continuously eliminating the "self" in one's mind can one more consciously follow closely and rely on the masses.

After September and October of last year, the Party Committee asked themselves a question: Why did they not approve of the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards? Why did they not understand and follow Chairman Mao's instructions? Everyone brought out their personal thoughts, repeatedly studied, traced the roots, and unanimously agreed that the situation had changed, the revolution had deepened, but their own thoughts had not kept up, so they did not approve of the deepening socialist revolution and were conservative, ultimately because of the problem of worldview, because of the "self" at work. From here, they understood: to Chairman Mao's instructions, only selflessness can lead to firm belief, and only firm belief can lead to close following. To closely follow the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, the most fundamental thing is to use the spirit of "seizing the day" to strive to eliminate the "self" in one's mind, seriously transform one's worldview. Whoever relaxes the transformation of their worldview and considers themselves an old revolutionary, an old comrade, or an old hero, relying on old merits to live, will have the danger of falling and being eliminated. They made a firm decision to, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, touch their souls deeply, and strive to transform their worldview, remove the stumbling blocks in their minds, and stride forward to follow Chairman Mao closely.

The comrades of the Party Committee, with various active thoughts in the Cultural Revolution, opened their doors wide and carried out self-revolution. Through the study of the "Three Old Articles" and the brilliant works such as the "Investigation Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan," they focused on solving the attitude towards the mass movement, thoroughly reflecting their conservative thoughts, and overcoming various "fears." The responsible comrades of the unit, in their struggle against the "self," dared to be ugly, dared to be painful, and actively exposed the problems in the depths of their souls to the masses. Not only did they expose them in the leading organ, but they also exposed them in lower-level organs and in the troops, accepting the supervision and help of the masses. They not only did this themselves but also required their subordinates to do the same. Since the Cultural Revolution, they have held more than ten sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres at the regiment level and above, focusing on solving the problem of insufficient ideological preparation for cadres in the new stage of socialist revolution. In the study, they took the left as an example, bringing the spirit of the five "dares" of the revolutionary youngsters to the battlefield of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. They fiercely fought against and criticized the "self" and revisionism, daring to engage in close combat and see the blade. While seizing the "self" in their minds, they deeply carried out a great criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and guidelines on the socialist revolution from the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, and further establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

Because the unit's Party Committee took the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, breaking the "self" and establishing the "public," the 6037 Unit, especially at some critical moments in supporting the left, always stood firmly and clearly, not being frightened by the ferocity of the class enemies, nor being subdued by various pressures, firmly standing on the side of the broad leftist masses, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with a fearless revolutionary spirit. When the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road manipulated the uninformed masses to try to strangle the organ of proletarian dictatorship, they fearlessly dispatched the unit to protect the newly born Qingdao Daily and the city radio station. When the newly established Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, headed by Comrade Wang Xiaoyu, was under attack, they stood up and gave the most resolute support. On May 28 of this year, the Shandong Military Region issued a statement, publicly criticizing the errors in supporting the left. After the news reached Qingdao, the unit's Party Committee immediately studied it and believed that the statement was in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. Despite all obstacles, they resolutely issued a public letter on June 2, firmly supporting the revolutionary action of the Shandong Military Region.

Looking back on a year of practice, the comrades of the 6037 Unit's Party Committee all deeply felt: only selflessness can lead to fearlessness, and only fearlessness can lead to close following. Only by eliminating selfishness can one be "daring" at the forefront. We must wholeheartedly follow the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, continuously revolutionize, thoroughly revolutionize, and vow to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, establishing new merits for the people.

    一切行动听伟大统帅毛主席的指挥
    ——6037部队党委领导“三支”“两军”工作的经验
    解放军报编者按：6037部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，坚决支持左派广大群众，为人民建立了新的功勋。他们的经验值得大家学习。
    6037部队支左工作经验，最重要的就是他们“跟上”跟得紧，“靠下”靠得近。
    “跟上”，就是紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟以毛主席为首的党中央，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。对毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的一切指示，句句照办，步步紧跟。遇到问题，及时请示报告。
    “靠下”，就是依靠真正的无产阶级革命派，依靠群众，遇事多和群众商量，勤作调查研究，坚信最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的群众，甘当群众的小学生。
    这样，做好“三支”“两军”工作就有了根本保证。
    “三支”“两军”工作，是我们伟大领袖毛主席交给我军的极其光荣而艰巨的政治任务。在支左中，做出了显著成绩的部队，要谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁；犯过错误的部队，要勇于改正，轻装前进，虚心向支左好的部队学习。在同一地区支左的部队，要互相学习，互相帮助，互相支持，并肩前进。我们一定要斗私批修，“跟上，靠下”，把支左工作搞得好上加好，决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席对我们的期望。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，6037部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地支持无产阶级革命派，取得了“三支”“两军”和部队革命化建设的双胜利，为人民建立了新的功勋。最近，他们热烈响应、认真学习伟大领袖毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的伟大号召，总结了前一阶段支左工作的经验。部队党委认为，要搞好支左工作，最最重要的就是要以“斗私，批修”为纲，做到跟上靠下：对上，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，一切行动听伟大统帅毛主席的指挥；对下，紧紧依靠真正的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，紧紧依靠部队广大指战员，拜群众为师，向群众学习。这是搞好支左工作的根本，也是我军革命化建设的根本。
        对毛主席的指示句句照办，步步紧跟
    林副主席说：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”一年来，6037部队所以能做好“三支”“两军”工作，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民建立新功，就是靠对伟大领袖毛主席的绝对信仰，无限忠诚。
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，部队党委对毛主席的指示，有的理解得比较快，有的暂时不理解或不完全理解，但是，他们牢牢记住一条：绝对坚信毛主席，无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的一切指示，句句坚信，步步紧跟，百分之百地照办，百分之百地执行。文化大革命初期，红卫兵小将“杀”向社会，起初他们看不惯，当看到毛主席一次又一次接见红卫兵，坚决支持革命小将的伟大榜样以后，他们就坚决扭转自己的看法，和革命小将站到一起。当毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”公布之后，他们以这个伟大文件为武器，认真地分析了青岛市的革命形势，认清了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的真面目，就坚决支持无产阶级革命派起来造反。去年九月，青岛市党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了挽救其彻底灭亡的命运，极尽造谣污蔑之能事，对革命的领导干部王效禹同志进行了极其恶毒的人身攻击。当时部队党委对王效禹同志并不了解，当看到毛主席对青岛问题的批示后，坚信毛主席的批示是无比正确的，就坚决和王效禹同志站在一起，全力地支持王效禹同志和青岛市的无产阶级革命派。今年一月二十二日，青岛市无产阶级革命派在王效禹同志领导下，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权时，部队党委当天夜里就作出决定，支持这个夺权。可是一夜间，全市贴了许多反对夺权的大字标语。部队内部议论纷纷。面对这种情况，党委组织大批机关干部，深入到青岛市各群众组织中去，进行了广泛的调查。然后组织大家带着调查来的情况，学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述，用阶级分析的方法进行了热烈讨论。最后大家认定：青岛市的党政财文大权过去确实被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺了，这个权应该夺回来；参加夺权的是无产阶级革命派，这个权夺得对。认识一致了，行动就坚决了，因此在支持夺权斗争中，尽管遭到谩骂、围攻甚至殴打，机关上下也毫不动摇，一支到底，在最紧急、最关键的时刻，为青岛市的无产阶级革命派撑了腰。
        及时向毛主席的无产阶级司令部请示报告
    6037部队党委认识到，尽管我们努力学习毛泽东思想，领会毛主席的革命路线，但我们的思想觉悟和认识水平总是有一定的局限性。只有我们伟大领袖毛主席站得最高，看得最远，最有预见性；只有毛主席的无产阶级司令部，能够掌握全局，洞察运动的发展趋势，对各种问题作出最准确、最妥善的处理。因此，他们在“三支”“两军”工作中遇到重大问题时，总是坚决地、及时地向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部请示报告。
    他们认为请示报告，不仅仅是上下关系、工作制度的问题，而且是对待以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部无比坚信，对待无产阶级文化大革命高度负责的问题。今年一月二十二日，部队党委得到青岛市无产阶级革命派夺权的消息后，便以严肃认真、高度负责的精神，立即召开紧急会议研究决定，一面积极支持，一面把夺权情况和自己的行动计划汇报给上级。当接到中央文革的指示后，他们连夜印发到部队，传达给全体干部、战士和职工、家属，做到人人皆知，家喻户晓。中央文革的指示，传达了毛主席的声音，给这个部队的广大指战员带来了极大的鼓舞和力量。
    请示报告，不是推卸责任，也不是把困难上交，而是革命的需要，是无产阶级革命的纪律。他们在支左过程中，对毛主席的最新指示和党的方针政策的贯彻执行，以及对一些重大问题的处理，都能采用电话、电报、书信、派人或者负责同志亲自去面谈等方法，及时汇报情况，请示工作。在请示报告之前，都进行充分的调查研究，提出自己的见解和打算，供上级参考。他们派到山东省昌潍地区的支左部队，对于打开局面的每一个较大的行动计划，都事先向山东省革命委员会和王效禹同志作详细的汇报，经过批准之后再执行。这样，就避免了走弯路，犯错误。他们体会，在文化大革命中，各地区的革命形势发展不平衡，进展有快有慢，反复有大有小，因此，加强请示报告，及时使下情上达，上情下达，既便于下头紧跟上头，也便于上级了解下情，适时加强领导。
    请示报告，也是向上级学习，受活的教育。他们每次请示报告得到上级的批示之后，总要认真地研究，深刻地领会，看领导上是怎样按照毛泽东思想和党的方针政策办事的，想自己又应当怎样按照毛主席的教导和根据上级的指示去处理问题。通过“一看一想”，不断地加深对毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的理解，不断端正前进的航向，加快紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的步伐。
        遵照毛主席的教导，紧紧依靠
    左派和广大革命群众
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：群众是真正的英雄。6037部队党委从实践中深刻体会到：革命群众最热爱毛主席，最热爱毛泽东思想，最理解毛主席的革命路线。要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就必须紧紧依靠左派和广大革命群众。
    今年三月，青岛市一个工厂的保守组织闹得很凶。部队领导机关负责同志便亲自带领三名机关干部来到这个工厂。他们遵照毛主席关于相信和依靠群众的教导，广泛发动革命群众做受蒙蔽群众的政治思想工作。他们反复向革命群众宣传毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的教导，消除了有些人的报复情绪，大家一起做受蒙蔽群众的思想工作。结果，使这个厂的保守组织很快就瓦解了，大长了革命群众的志气。通过这一实践，他们亲身体验到，做好受蒙蔽群众的工作，对于支持左派组织和壮大左派组织的重要意义，也更深刻理解了毛主席所教导的“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决”这一伟大真理。他们总结了经验，指导了支左工作。后来部队介入山东省昌潍地区文化大革命时，面对着保守势力占优势的情况下，采取同样办法，依靠了广大左派群众向保守组织展开强大的政治攻势，对受蒙蔽的群众进行细致的政治思想工作，在很短的时间内扭转了这个地区的局势。
    他们在支左工作中除了紧紧依靠左派广大群众，还紧紧依靠部队的广大干部战士，遇事走群众路线，大家出主意，想办法，尊重群众的首创精神，发挥集体智慧。他们对支左工作中的各项重大行动，都交给领导机关的群众和执行支左任务的干部战士，充分讨论，充分酝酿。认识有分歧，就带着问题学习毛主席的教导，用毛泽东思想统一大家的认识。使部队上上下下在毛主席的革命路线上更巩固地团结起来，眼往一处看，心往一处想，劲往一处使，使“三支”“两军”工作越做越好。
    以毛泽东思想为指针，不断总结经验
    “三支”“两军”工作是一个崭新的事物，要认识这个事物，做好这项工作，就要以毛泽东思想为指针，不断总结经验教训。6037部队党委在实践中深刻体会到，对毛主席的教导，有些暂时不理解或者不完全理解，执行就不自觉。只要不断地总结实践中的经验教训，就会变不理解为理解，变不自觉为自觉。
    投入支左后不久，部队负责同志便带领工作组，深入到四个县和几个工厂，进行调查研究，了解情况，发现问题，总结经验教训，加强对支左工作的领导。今年以来，他们先后四次把支左的干部战士集中起来，通过集训和开讲用会的办法，广泛交流支左工作的经验教训。大家带着实践中的问题，对照毛主席的指示，看那些做对了，符合毛主席的教导；那些做错了，不符合毛主席的教导，从而加深对毛主席革命路线的理解，增强执行的自觉性。这个部队的一个单位在某县支左，一开始就坚定地站在革命派一边，大力支持了左派群众。保守组织基本上处于自行解体的状态。但是，就在这种比较顺利的时候，他们不够冷静，忽视了政策和策略，支持了革命派的一些急于求成的做法，结果给做好受蒙蔽群众的工作带来一些困难。事情发生后，他们坐下来认真地总结了这次教训，深深体验到毛主席“政策和策略是党的生命”这一伟大教导的重大意义。对于受蒙蔽的群众采取简单粗暴的办法，看起来是“快”了，实际上是“慢”了；看起来是帮左派的忙，实际上是帮倒忙。通过这次总结，提高了大家对做受蒙蔽群众工作的自觉性。
    不断总结经验教训，就能有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。今年四月，在一些革命群众组织内，出现了无政府主义、山头主义、小团体主义等错误倾向，妨碍了革命大联合。怎样解决这些问题呢？部队负责同志带着这个问题深入下去一连摸了三个星期。一天，他到青岛市自行车厂召开座谈会，发现驻这个厂的支左同志用举办毛主席著作集训队的办法，帮助革命群众组织的负责人学习毛主席著作，解决了本厂革命群众组织间的团结问题。部队负责同志便和他们一起总结经验，并向全市支左部队进行了推广，大大促进了全市的革命大联合和学习毛主席著作的群众运动。
    狠抓世界观的改造，为人民立新功
    6037部队党委从一年来的实践中深刻体会到，要做到跟上靠下，就必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。只有不断地清除头脑中的“私”字，才能做到更自觉地跟上靠下。
    去年九、十月份以后，党委给自己提出了一个问题：为什么对红卫兵小将的革命行动看不惯？为什么对毛主席的指示不理解，跟不上？大家带着这个问题，摆出个人的思想，反复研究，追根溯源，一致认识到：情况变化了，革命深入了，而我们自己的思想却没有跟上，所以对深入发展的社会主义革命就看不惯，就保守，归根结蒂是世界观问题，是一个“私”字在作怪。从这里他们理解到：对于毛主席的指示，无私才能坚信，坚信才能紧跟。要紧紧跟随伟大统帅毛主席，最最根本的就是要用“只争朝夕”的精神狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，认真地改造自己的世界观。谁若放松对自己世界观的改造，而以老革命、老前辈、老功臣自居，靠老本吃饭，谁就有垮下去、被淘汰的危险。他们下定决心，要在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，狠触自己的灵魂，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，搬掉思想上的“绊脚石”，阔步紧跟毛主席。
    党委的同志带着文化大革命中的各种活思想，敞开大门，大闹自我革命。通过学习“老三篇”和《湖南农民运动考察报告》等光辉著作，着重解决对待群众运动的态度，大反自己的保守思想，克服各种“怕”字。部队负责同志在同“私”字作斗争中，不怕丑，不怕痛，主动地把自己灵魂深处的问题亮给群众。不仅在领导机关里亮，而且到下级机关中去亮，到连队里去亮，接受群众的监督和帮助。他们不但自己这样做，也要求下级这样做。文化大革命以来，他们对团以上领导干部举办了十多期毛泽东思想学习班，着重解决领导干部在社会主义革命进入新阶段后思想准备不足的问题。学习中，他们以左派为榜样，把革命小将的五敢精神带到斗私批修的战场。对私、修狠斗猛批，敢于短兵相接，刺刀见红。在夺自己头脑中“私”字的权的同时，深入开展对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙彭德怀、罗瑞卿的大批判，从斗私和批修中加深领会毛主席关于社会主义革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，进一步树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    由于部队党委带头活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，6037部队在支左工作中，特别是在一些关键时刻，始终立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，不为阶级敌人的凶焰所吓倒，也不为各方面的压力所屈服，坚定地站在左派广大群众一边，以大无畏的革命精神捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。当党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵不明真象的群众，妄图扼杀无产阶级专政的舆论工具时，他们不怕围攻，不怕殴打，及时派出部队保卫了新生的《青岛日报》社和市广播电台。当新成立的由王效禹同志主持的山东省革命委员会遭到围攻的紧急关头，他们又挺身而出，给予最坚决的支持。今年五月二十八日，山东省军区发表声明，公开检讨支左工作中的错误。消息传到青岛后，部队党委立即研究，认为这个声明符合毛主席的教导，便不顾一切阻力，毅然决然地在六月二日发表公开信，坚决支持省军区的这一革命行动。
    回顾一年来的实践，6037部队党委的同志都深有感触地说：无私才能无畏，无畏才能紧跟，只有破除私心，才能“敢”字当头。我们要一心一意紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，不断革命，彻底革命，誓死保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线，为人民立新功。
