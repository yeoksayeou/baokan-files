Comrade Lin Biao's extremely important speech at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of all the warriors of the Shandong Red Guards Command. Our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the great battle call of "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Oppose Revisionism." We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and swiftly, resolutely, enthusiastically, and loyally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must take "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Oppose Revisionism" as the guiding principle, to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more extensively and deeply, strengthen ideological construction, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeois worldview, completely eliminate the "Four Olds," and firmly establish the "Four News" of the proletariat. We must firmly uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrade Deputy Commander Lin teaches us: "Criticize and repudiate self means to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the 'self' in one's mind. Oppose revisionism means to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These two tasks are interrelated. Only by thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the 'self' can we better carry the struggle against revisionism to the end."

"Criticize and repudiate self and oppose revisionism" is the guiding principle for all our work and the directive for our actions.

In the more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, the storm of class struggle has given us profound education and stern tests. In the new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we must firmly grasp the guiding principle of "Criticize and repudiate self and oppose revisionism," firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and overthrow and expose politically, ideologically, and theoretically the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with Liu Shaoqi as their representative, so that they can never rise again. In the revolutionary criticism, we must further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts.

To oppose revisionism, we must criticize and repudiate self, which is particularly important for our younger generation. Over the past seventeen years, bourgeois intellectuals have dominated our schools, and the old ideas of the exploiting classes have deeply influenced our minds. The erroneous trends of anarchism, factionalism, opportunism, and small-groupism that have appeared in our ranks are all the result of the manifestation of the petty-bourgeois ideology in our minds. Unless we resolutely break with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology and resolutely criticize and repudiate the 'self,' we cannot be thoroughly revolutionary.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to thoroughly break with the various ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes. The core of the various ideological consciousness of the old society is the "self." All old things are old because of the "self," and all bad things are bad because of the "self." The new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, all new things, are new because of the "public." The "public" is the core of the proletarian worldview, and all good things are good because of the "public." To complete the great historical task of opposing revisionism, we must fiercely criticize and repudiate the "self," thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and firmly establish the "public" and proletarian ideology.

The Shandong Red Guards Command will immediately follow the important instructions of Comrade Deputy Commander Lin, open study classes, and seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We will use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly transform our worldview, deeply examine our souls, and fiercely criticize and repudiate the "self" in our minds. We will resolutely engage in fierce struggles and thorough breaks with all non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, ruthlessly eliminate petty-bourgeois factionalism, actively enhance proletarian party spirit, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds and blend into our blood. We will build an iron wall in our minds to prevent and oppose revisionism.

    在头脑中筑起一道防修反修的钢铁长城
　　红卫兵山东指挥部
    林彪同志在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上发表的极为重要的讲话，极大地鼓舞了我们红卫兵山东指挥部全体战士的革命斗志。我们伟大的统帅毛主席向我们发出了“斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号令。我们一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，最迅速、最坚决、最热忱、最忠实地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示。我们要以“斗私，批修”为纲，更广泛、更深入地展开活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，加强思想建设，大破资产阶级世界观，彻底扫除“四旧”，大立特立无产阶级的“四新”，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    林副统帅教导我们说：“斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的‘私’字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”
      “斗私，批修”，是我们进行一切工作的纲，是我们行动的指南。
    在一年多的文化大革命运动中，阶级斗争的暴风雨，使我们受到了深刻的教育和严峻的考验。在革命大批判、革命大联合和革命“三结合”的新高潮中，我们一定要紧紧抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒斗臭，使他们永世不得翻身。在革命的大批判中，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地。
    批修必须斗私，这对我们青年一代尤其重要。十七年来，由于资产阶级知识分子统治我们的学校，剥削阶级的旧思想在我们头脑中留下很深的影响。我们队伍中出现的无政府主义、山头主义、风头主义、小团体主义等错误思潮，都是我们头脑中小资产阶级思想的劣根性发作的结果。不坚决地与资产阶级、小资产阶级思想彻底决裂，不坚决斗掉“私”字，我们就不能彻底革命。
    无产阶级文化大革命就是要同剥削阶级的种种思想意识实行最彻底决裂的伟大革命。旧社会遗留下来的种种剥削阶级思想意识的核心，就是一个“私”字。一切旧东西，都旧在一个“私”字上，一切坏东西，也都是坏在一个“私”字上。无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，一切新东西，都是新在一个“公”字上。“公”字是无产阶级世界观的核心，一切好东西，都是好在一个“公”字上。为了完成批修的伟大历史任务，我们必须狠斗“私”字，大破资产阶级思想，大立“公”字，大立无产阶级思想。
    我们红卫兵山东指挥部一定遵照林副统帅的重要指示，立即开办学习班，认真地活学活用毛主席著作，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来彻底改造我们的世界观，狠触自己的灵魂，狠挖自己头脑中的“私”字，坚决与自己头脑中的一切非无产阶级思想进行激烈的交锋、彻底的决裂，无情地铲除小资产阶级的派性，积极增强无产阶级的党性，让伟大的毛泽东思想扎根在我们头脑里，溶化在我们血液中，在我们思想上筑起一道防修、反修的钢铁长城。
