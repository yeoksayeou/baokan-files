The Soviet revisionists' restoration of capitalism has been met with enthusiastic praise from the mouthpieces of the Western bourgeoisie. Western bourgeois newspapers and news agencies have, in recent times, continuously published articles and reports, celebrating the Soviet revisionist leadership's push for "new systems" and "contracting production to brigades" in Soviet industry and agriculture, measures aimed at restoring capitalism. The enthusiastic praise from the Western bourgeoisie's mouthpieces proves, from another angle, that the Soviet revisionist leadership has thoroughly carried out the restoration of capitalism.

From the very first day the Soviet revisionist leadership implemented the so-called "new economic system" with profit as its core, newspapers and news agencies in the United States and other capitalist countries have been quick to praise it as the "Westernization" of Soviet industry, as "Russian capitalism." The American magazine *Newsweek* published an article last December titled "Business Trends, Russian Capitalism," which stated: "The Soviet Union is accelerating the transformation of its industry into a capitalist profit-making system." This has made the Soviet economy "no longer under state control" but "increasingly turning to market forces to determine production, prices, and profits."

Prior to this, *U.S. News & World Report* published a report praising the "liberalization" in Soviet industry. The report stated that now the Soviet Union is "determining (industrial product) prices based on the average costs of various industries," which means that "a few highly efficient enterprises in various industrial sectors will reap huge profits," while the numerous inefficient enterprises "will suffer the greatest losses." The report believed that this change in the Soviet industrial system "is still called communism, as it is now in Yugoslavia, but it will have nothing in common with the comprehensive centralized planning system that Russia has implemented for nearly fifty years." The report pointed out with satisfaction: "The changes currently occurring in Russia may mark the beginning of the end of the communist system that has been in place for nearly fifty years in this country."

Regarding the Soviet revisionist leadership's push for "contracting production to brigades," a reporter from Agence France-Presse praised it in a March report as the "liberalization" of the Soviet agricultural system. The British *Irish Times* published an article in March titled "Fundamental Changes in Russian Agriculture," which praised that Soviet newspapers had "boldly and resolutely attacked the foundations of the collective system," describing this as "quite astonishing and bold."

### 苏修复辟资本主义  西方资产阶级喉舌一片喝采声

    苏修复辟资本主义
    西方资产阶级喉舌一片喝采声
    西方资产阶级报刊和通讯社，一个时期以来，不断发表文章和报道，兴高采烈地宣扬苏修领导集团在苏联工农业中加紧推行的“新体制”、“包产到组”等复辟资本主义的措施。西方资产阶级喉舌这一片喝采声，从另一个方面向人们证明了：苏修领导集团已经彻底实行了资本主义复辟。
    从苏修领导集团推行以利润挂帅为核心的所谓“新经济体制”的第一天起，美国和其他资本主义国家报刊和通讯社就纷纷称赞这是苏联工业的“西方化”，是“俄国的资本主义”。美国《新闻周刊》去年十二月刊载题为《商业趋势，俄国的资本主义》的文章说：“苏俄正在加速把它的工业转变为资本主义的赢利制度”。这使得苏联的经济“已经不是由国家进行控制”，而是“已经大规模地越来越转向让市场势力来决定生产、价格和利润了”。
    在这以前，《美国新闻与世界报道》在一篇报道中，也赞扬了苏联工业中的这种“自由化”。报道说，现在苏联是“根据各种工业的平均费用来确定（工业品）价格”的，“这意味着，各种工业部门中少数一些效率最高的企业，将得到巨额利润。”而为数众多的效率低的企业，“将要蒙受最大的损失”。报道认为苏联工业中这种制度的改变“仍被称为共产主义，如现在在南斯拉夫那样，但是，它将和俄国将近五十年来实行的全面的集中计划制度毫无相似之处”。报道满意地指出：“俄国目前出现的改变，可能标志着在这个国家中，实行了将近五十年的共产主义制度开始结束”。
    对于苏修统治集团大搞“包产到组”，法新社记者在今年三月的报道中赞扬说，这是苏联“农业制度的‘自由化’”。英国《爱尔兰时报》今年三月发表题为《俄国农业发生根本变化》的文章夸赞说，苏联报纸“对集体制度的根基作了大胆的坚定的攻击”，这“是相当惊人和大胆的”。
