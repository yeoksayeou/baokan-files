	Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 14th: Beijing revolutionary young people who went to the pastoral area of Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia to settle down and become members and herdsmen arrived in the grassland city of Xilin Hot on the 12th and were warmly welcomed by several thousand revolutionary people and young intellectuals of various ethnic groups in the area.

	The revolutionary fighters of the "January 26th" proletarian revolutionary faction and the "Xilin Three Commands" Red Flag Flying Brigade of Red Guards in Xilin Hot, upon hearing the good news that Beijing revolutionary young people were setting out to become members and herdsmen in the pastoral area of Xilin Gol League, some spread the news eagerly, some posted large banners of warm welcome. Various ethnic revolutionary masses flocked to the streets to prepare for the welcome. At 4:30 PM on the 12th, when the Beijing revolutionary young people, the representatives of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee who sent them off, and the responsible persons of the Xilin Gol League Military Sub-district, revolutionary leading cadres, and revolutionary faction representatives who went to welcome them on the way, entered the grassland city of Xilin Hot, the streets immediately boiled over. The welcoming crowd continuously shouted, "Warmly welcome the revolutionary youth from Chairman Mao's side!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

	The revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups held a welcoming rally in front of the League Office. Revolutionary leading cadres and representatives of the "January 26th" proletarian revolutionary faction liaison station delivered welcome speeches, expressing their willingness to assist them in settling down well and hoping that they would make contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xilin Gol League. The Red Guards of the "Xilin Three Commands" Red Flag Flying Brigade expressed at the welcoming meeting that they would resolutely learn from the Beijing revolutionary young people, learn from their revolutionary spirit of actively coming to the frontier of the motherland to settle down and combine with the agricultural and pastoral people, take "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, and take the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	The representative of the Beijing revolutionary young people who came to settle down in Xilin Gol League said in his speech: Most beloved Chairman Mao, we follow your great instruction for intellectuals to combine with workers and peasants, and have taken the first step. We will follow this revolutionary path and go all the way! We will remember your teachings and dedicate our lives to the people, be the people's ox, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will be on the grassland, look at the world, continue to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, actively learn and apply your works, and stride forward bravely on the revolutionary road.

	The Beijing revolutionary youths who are about to settle down in the Xilin Gol League's Xiwuzhumuqin Banner's Baiyinbaolige Commune have already prepared the settlement work for them, purchasing yurts and furniture for them, and even preparing winter clothing such as fur coats and felt boots. The herdsmen expressed that they would definitely take care of and help them grow up healthily, just like their own children, so that the Beijing seeds would take root and sprout in the frontier grassland, blossom, and bear fruit.
