A delegation from the Albanian Party and Government, led by Ramiz Aliya, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, arrived in Dazhai, the red banner of China's agricultural frontline in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, today. They were accompanied by Li Fuchun, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Liu Ningyi, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. They were warmly received and enthusiastically welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Dazhai.

Today, Dazhai village was filled with joy, with red flags flying and songs echoing. Thousands of poor and lower-middle peasants from Dazuan and revolutionary masses from Xiyang County, with hearts full of joy, held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, as well as the national flags of China and Albania. They formed long lines, welcoming the Albanian comrades from the frontline of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism like long-lost relatives.

Around 10 a.m., the special plane carrying the Albanian comrades landed smoothly. Yuan Zhen, a member of the core group of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, and Chen Yonggui, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and Secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, who had come from Taiyuan to welcome them, went forward to shake hands and embrace Aliya and the others warmly.

When the Albanian guests entered the village, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai beat drums and gongs, waved copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Enver Hoxha! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years! Long live the fighting friendship between the two parties and two peoples of China and Albania!"

A welcoming ceremony was then held. Yuan Zhen, on behalf of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and the people of the entire province, extended the warmest welcome to the Albanian comrades and offered revolutionary greetings from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Albanian guests were very pleased to see how the people of Dazhai had transformed the poor gorge into neat terraces and bountiful fields with their hard work. They saw how the people of Dazhai studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought to turn barren mountains into fertile land. The Albanian comrades highly praised the self-reliant and industrious revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai.

Aliya and the others then visited Chen Yonggui's home. Aliya and Chen Yonggui had a very friendly conversation. Chen Yonggui introduced to the guests the great achievements made by the people of Dazhai in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, emphasizing the importance of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Aliya highly praised the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai. Li Fuchun thanked Aliya for his friendly remarks and encouraged the people of Dazhai to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve even greater successes in seizing the revolution and promoting production. When the Albanian comrades left Dazhai, thousands of people lined the streets to see them off, shouting, "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong-Enver."
