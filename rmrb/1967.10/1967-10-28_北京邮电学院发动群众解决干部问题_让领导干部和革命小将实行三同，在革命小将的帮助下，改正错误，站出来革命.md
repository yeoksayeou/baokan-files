Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, which had already achieved great unity and the three-in-one combination, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, they firmly implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, expanded the scope of education, united the majority, and helped a large number of revolutionary cadres stand up, straighten their backs, and shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and work together with the proletarian revolutionary faction.

	Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, unifying understanding

The majority of cadres at the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications had, to varying degrees, carried out the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement, leading to serious antagonism between cadres and the masses. In particular, the Chinese Khrushchev had implemented a bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" in cadre matters, causing all the cadres of this institute to be sidelined. Some masses, influenced by the reactionary trends of "overthrowing everything" and "doubting everything," believed that the Institute of Posts and Telecommunications had "no good cadres" and was a "rotten" unit. Some masses also thought that the cadres of the Institute of Posts and Telecommunications were "small at both ends, large in the middle, with few bad ones, but good ones were hard to find."

Faced with this situation, the broad proletarian revolutionary faction realized that to correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, they must first have a correct assessment of the cadre team. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a major debate on cadre issues throughout the institute.

Great leader Mao Zedong taught us to believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted a comprehensive class analysis of all the cadres in the institute. They believed that the majority of cadres were both executors and victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. Although they had made various mistakes, the vast majority of them loved the Party and Chairman Mao and were good or relatively good, with only a very small number being bad. The proletarian revolutionary faction must adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" towards cadres who have made mistakes, and enthusiastically help them correct their mistakes and continue the revolution.

After unifying their understanding on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses of the entire institute first joined the cadres in criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group." Revolutionary cadres on stage exposed and denounced the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line against themselves, and many revolutionary youngsters in the audience were moved to tears. Through criticism, the broad revolutionary teachers and students gained a more comprehensive understanding of all the cadres in the institute.

	Mobilize the masses, everyone does cadre work

Mobilizing the masses and having everyone do cadre work is an important experience of the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications in solving cadre problems well. The advantage of doing this is that problems are solved quickly, the mass base is solid, and both cadres and masses are educated.

The revolutionary youngsters of this institute had long pointed out that leaving so many leading cadres aside and not letting them go among the masses is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought. After unifying their understanding of the cadre team, the revolutionary youngsters quickly took the lead in organizing a full-institute "cadre issue link-up meeting," broadly mobilizing revolutionary teachers and students to join the struggle to solve cadre problems. They divided all the deputy section-level and above leading cadres into various combat teams (classes), with each combat team taking responsibility for working with them. After the cadres arrived at the combat teams, they lived with the revolutionary youngsters every day, jointly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, and some cadres who lived in the institute also moved their bedding to the student dormitories and implemented the three-in-one policy with the youngsters. In the process of living together, the revolutionary youngsters, on the one hand, seriously and enthusiastically helped the cadres recognize, examine, and correct their mistakes, so that they could quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; on the other hand, they conducted organized and led thorough and detailed investigations and research on the cadres, ensuring that they had a clear understanding of each cadre.

Chairman Mao said: "Not only should one look at a cadre's one-time one-event, but also at a cadre's entire history and entire work, this is the main method of identifying cadres." In May, when the revolutionary committee of the institute was established, everyone discussed the issue of whether an original deputy director could join the three-in-one leadership. This deputy director was originally in charge of teaching work. Therefore, some people thought that his mistakes in executing the revisionist educational line and the bourgeois reactionary line were serious, and that he was not suitable for the combination. However, after an in-depth and detailed investigation and presenting facts and reasoning, and a comprehensive and historical analysis of his problems, everyone unanimously agreed that this deputy director had been loyal to the Party and the revolutionary cause for more than twenty years, had enthusiasm for work, and had a deep understanding and recognition of the mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line. During his tenure in charge of teaching work, he had also fought against the revisionist educational line. After extensive discussions among the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire institute, this deputy director was elected as the deputy director of the revolutionary committee of the institute.

	With "fight selfishness, criticize revisionism" as the guideline, seriously remold worldview

The broad cadres of the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, with the enthusiastic help of the revolutionary youngsters, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, proposing to make three revolts: revolt against the revisionist educational line; revolt against the bourgeois reactionary line; revolt against the "self" in one's own mind. They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "you must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better," and decided to seriously remold themselves among the masses. They exposed their "self" in the combat teams to the youngsters, actively made soul-searching examinations, strictly demanded of themselves in their shared life with the youngsters, actively sought the youngsters' opinions about themselves, and in the great criticism battles, washed away the dirt and filth in their minds.

Through living and fighting together with the revolutionary youngsters, many cadres established deep revolutionary feelings with the youngsters, and thus shed the burden of fearing that the youngsters would "hold on to them" and worrying that their problems would "not be cleared up," and strengthened their revolutionary confidence. Some cadres deeply felt: "In the past, our relationship with the youngsters was like oil and water, and we could never mix; now we are like fish and water, and we can't be separated." Many cadres were thus tempered and remolded among the masses, gained the trust of the masses, and were recommended by the masses to various leadership positions to take on leadership work.

	Let revolutionary cadres shoulder heavy responsibilities and build new achievements

The Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications originally had 78 deputy section-level and above leading cadres, of whom 49 cadres are now serving as core and backbone members in various leadership positions, working with the proletarian revolutionary faction to grasp revolution and promote work, fully playing their roles. The deputy director of the revolutionary committee, the original deputy director Liu Yantian, has experience in work, sees problems more comprehensively, and can get close to the masses. He played a key role in leading the entire institute's work of resuming classes and making revolution and carrying out criticism and reform. The masses happily said, "We ourselves selected these cadres, and we trust them and can rely on them." Those cadres who have not yet taken on work are currently studying in Mao Zedong Thought classes. Through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, their ideological level has also greatly improved, and they are welcomed by the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

    北京邮电学院发动群众解决干部问题
    让领导干部和革命小将实行三同，在革命小将的帮助下，改正错误，站出来革命
    据新华社二十七日讯　在毛主席革命路线的指引下，早已实现了革命大联合、革命三结合的北京邮电学院的无产阶级革命派，在驻院人民解放军军训团的热情帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，扩大教育面，团结大多数，使一大批革命干部站了出来，挺起腰杆，同无产阶级革命派一起，勇敢地挑起革命、工作两副担子。
      在毛泽东思想的指导下统一认识
    北京邮电学院的广大干部，在运动初期都不同程度地执行了资产阶级反动路线，干群之间产生了严重的对立情绪。特别是中国的赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上推行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，使这个学院的广大干部统统靠边站了。有些群众由于受了“打倒一切”、“怀疑一切”反动思潮的影响，认为邮电学院“没有好干部”，是“烂掉了”的单位。也有的群众认为邮电学院的干部是“两头小，中间大，坏的虽不多，好的也难找”。
    面对着这种情况，广大无产阶级革命派认识到，要正确地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，首先就要对干部队伍有一个正确的估价。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，在全院范围内展开了干部问题的大辩论。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，要相信和依靠干部的大多数。邮电学院的无产阶级革命派根据毛主席的教导，对全院的干部进行了全面的阶级分析。他们认为，大多数干部既是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。他们尽管犯了这样或那样的错误，但他们绝大多数是热爱党，热爱毛主席的，是好的和比较好的，不好的只是极少数。无产阶级革命派对于犯错误的干部，必须采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，热情地帮助他们改正错误，继续革命。
    在毛泽东思想基础上统一了认识以后，全院革命群众首先同干部一起，批判了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，革命干部在台上揭发控诉资产阶级反动路线对自己的迫害，有许多革命小将在台下感动得流下了眼泪。通过批判，广大革命师生对全院干部有了更全面的了解。
      放手发动群众，人人做干部工作
    放手发动群众，人人做干部工作，这是北京邮电学院解决好干部问题的一条重要经验。这样做的好处是：问题解决的快，群众基础牢，干部、群众受教育大。
    这个学院的革命小将早就指出，把这么多的领导干部撇在一边，让他们“闭门思过”，不到群众中去是不符合毛泽东思想的。革命小将在统一了对干部队伍的认识以后，很快就有领导地组织了一个全院性的“干部问题串连会”，广泛发动革命师生投入解决干部问题的斗争。他们把全院副科级以上的领导干部分别分到各个战斗队（班），由每个战斗队包干负责进行工作。干部到了战斗队后，每天和革命小将生活在一起，共同批判资产阶级反动路线，有的家就住在学院里面的干部，也把铺盖搬到学生宿舍，和小将们实行三同。在共同生活中，革命小将一方面严肃热情地帮助干部认识错误，检查错误，改正错误，使他们尽快地回到毛主席革命路线上来；一方面有组织，有领导地对干部进行认真细致的调查研究，做到了对每个干部心中有数。
    毛主席说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”今年五月份成立院革命委员会时，大家就对原来的一个副院长能否参加三结合班子的问题进行了群众性的讨论。这个副院长原来负责教学工作。因此有人认为他在执行修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动路线方面错误严重，结合他不合适。可是，经过深入细致的调查和摆事实，讲道理，全面地、历史地分析了他的问题以后，大家一致认为这个副院长参加革命二十多年来，对党对革命事业是忠诚的，工作上是有干劲的，对执行资产阶级反动路线的错误，有较深刻的检查和认识。在他负责教学工作期间，也曾和修正主义教育路线作过斗争。经过全院革命师生的广泛讨论，这个副院长被推为院革命委员会的副主任。
  以“斗私，批修”为纲，认真改造世界观
    北京邮电学院的广大干部，在革命小将的热情帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，提出了要造三个反：造修正主义教育路线的反；造资产阶级反动路线的反；造自己头脑中“私”字的反。他们按照毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的伟大教导，决心在群众中认真改造自己。他们在战斗队里，向小将们大亮自己头脑中的“私”字，主动作触及灵魂的检查，在和小将共同的生活中，严格要求自己，主动征求小将对自己的意见，在大批判的战斗中，洗刷自己头脑中的污泥浊水。
    通过和革命小将共同生活，一起战斗，不少干部和革命小将建立了深厚的革命感情，因而卸掉了怕小将“揪住不放”，担心自己的问题“搞不清”等思想包袱，坚定了革命信心。有的干部深有体会地说：“过去我们和小将是油和水的关系，两下总是搅不拢；现在我们是鱼和水的关系，要分也分不开了。”许多干部就是这样在群众中锻炼自己，改造自己，取得了群众的信任，又被群众推荐到各级领导岗位担任了领导工作。
      让革命干部挑重担建新功
    北京邮电学院原有副科级以上的领导干部七十八人，目前已有四十九名干部在各级领导岗位上充当核心和骨干，和无产阶级革命派一起，抓革命促工作，充分发挥他们的作用。院革委会副主任，原副院长刘砚田同志，工作有经验，看问题比较全面，能深入群众，在领导全院复课闹革命和斗批改的工作中，起了骨干作用。群众高兴地说，我们自己挑选的干部，我们就是信得过，靠得上。那些暂时还没有担任工作的干部，目前正在毛泽东思想学习班里学习。他们通过斗私批修，思想上也有很大提高，受到广大革命师生的欢迎。
