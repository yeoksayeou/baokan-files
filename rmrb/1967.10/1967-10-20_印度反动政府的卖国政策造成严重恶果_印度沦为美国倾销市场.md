Due to the intensification of U.S. imperialism's economic plunder of India, India's trade with the United States has become increasingly unequal, with the trade deficit increasing nearly eightfold over ten years. India has become the second-largest dumping ground for the U.S. in Asia, second only to Japan.

According to a report by the *Hindustan Times* on the 2nd, the U.S. annually dumps a large amount of goods into India, with exports increasing by 237% over the past ten years, from $274 million in 1956 to $923 million in 1966.

In contrast, over the same period, India's exports to the U.S. increased by only about 50%, from $206 million to $324 million. As a result, the U.S.'s exports to India are nearly three times India's exports to the U.S.

This extremely unequal trade with the U.S. has caused India's trade deficit with the U.S. to rapidly increase, from $68 million in 1956 to $599 million in 1966. This means that India's trade deficit with the U.S. has increased nearly eightfold over ten years.

India's extremely unequal situation in trade with the U.S. is the result of U.S. imperialism's intensified plunder and aggression against India, and it is also the consequence of the reactionary policies of the Indian National Congress government, which kowtows to and relies on the U.S. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　印度反动政府的卖国政策造成严重恶果
    印度沦为美国倾销市场
    由于美帝国主义加紧对印度的经济掠夺，印度同美国的贸易越来越不平等，贸易赤字在十年内增加了近八倍。印度沦为美国在亚洲的第二大倾销市场，仅次于日本。
    据《印度斯坦旗报》二日报道，美国每年向印度大量倾销商品，出口额在最近十年里增加了百分之二百三十七，即从一九五六年的二亿七千四百万美元，急遽增加到一九六六年的九亿二千三百万美元。
    相反，在这十年里，印度向美国的出口额仅仅增加了百分之五十多，即只从二亿零六百万美元增为三亿二千四百万美元。结果，美国对印度的出口额等于印度对美国出口额的将近三倍。
    同美国这种极为不平等的贸易，使得印度的对美贸易赤字迅速增加，即从一九五六年的六千八百万美元增加为一九六六年的五亿九千九百万美元。也就是说，印度对美贸易赤字在十年里增加了近八倍。
    印度在对美贸易方面的这种极为不平等的局面，是美帝国主义加紧掠夺、侵略印度造成的，也是印度反动的国大党政府推行屈从美国、依赖美国的卖国政策的恶果。　（据新华社讯）
