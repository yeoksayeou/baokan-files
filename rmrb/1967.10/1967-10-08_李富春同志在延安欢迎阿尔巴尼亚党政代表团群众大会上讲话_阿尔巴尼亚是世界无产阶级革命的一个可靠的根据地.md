Comrade Li Fuchun's Speech at the Mass Rally in Yan'an Welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation

Albania is a Reliable Base for the World Proletarian Revolution

	New China News Agency, Yan'an, October 7th

	Comrade Li Fuchun's speech at the mass rally in Yan'an on October 7th welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation is as follows:

	Dear Comrade Ramiz Alia, dear members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, comrades, and fellow fighters:

	Today, the people of Yan'an are holding a grand gathering at the site of the historic Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China to warmly welcome our close comrades, Comrade Ramiz Alia and the members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation. They have brought with them the deep revolutionary friendship of the Albanian people from the shores of the Adriatic Sea. We extend our highest respects to the distinguished guests from heroic Albania, to the fraternal Albanian people, to the glorious Albanian Party of Labour, and to our close friend, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

	Yan'an is the holy land of the Chinese revolution. Our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao, led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to successfully complete the Long March of 25,000 li and here led the entire Chinese people in an eight-year war of resistance against Japan and a three-year war of liberation, ultimately achieving victory in the Chinese revolution. In Yan'an, Chairman Mao wrote a series of brilliant works of Marxism-Leninism at the highest level of the contemporary era, developing Marxism-Leninism in a brilliant and creative way. The people of Yan'an were fortunate to live under the leadership of Chairman Mao, fighting alongside the people of the entire country for the victory of the Chinese revolution, and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Today, we are particularly pleased and excited to welcome our comrades from Albania, who are on the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle.

	I worked in Yan'an for eight years. At that time, I saw with my own eyes how countless revolutionary youth, with hearts aflame, came from all over the country to Yan'an to join the revolutionary ranks led by Chairman Mao; I saw with my own eyes how many young and middle-aged cadres were educated in Yan'an by the great thought of Mao Zedong, and from there rushed to the battlefronts of various base areas. I personally experienced how Chairman Mao, at every critical juncture of the Chinese revolution, as the great helmsman, steered the ship of the Chinese revolution, breaking through countless waves and navigating past countless reefs, advancing along the correct path.

	Yan'an at that time was the revolutionary center that the people of the entire country looked up to, the greatest base area of the Chinese revolution, a beacon of revolutionary light.

	When we talk about Yan'an at that time, we naturally think of today's heroic Albania, which, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe. Socialist Albania is an unshakable revolutionary stronghold standing on the shores of the Adriatic Sea, a reliable base area for the world proletarian revolution.

	Under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the Albanian Party of Labour, the heroic Albanian people have raised a magnificent red flag of Marxism-Leninism in Europe, where imperialism and revisionism are in their death throes, illuminating the path forward for the European proletariat and making immortal contributions to the world proletarian revolutionary cause. The Albanian Party of Labour is truly a revolutionary party of Marxism-Leninism. The Albanian people are truly great. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people feel immense pride in having such comrades as the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people, and regard them as our learning examples.

	The Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people, in the face of the heavy encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism, fearlessly resist violence and bravely overcome difficulties, insisting on the socialist road, fully demonstrating the spirit of proletarian backbone. We must learn from their tenacious revolutionary will and fearless heroic spirit.

	The Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people, holding high the banner of opposition to imperialism, resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation, resolutely support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. We must learn from their spirit of loyalty to proletarian internationalism.

	The Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people, holding high the banner of opposition to modern revisionism, are engaged in a resolute struggle against the Soviet revisionist clique, the Titoite clique, and various kinds of scabs, defending and developing Marxism-Leninism, and making outstanding contributions to the international communist movement. We must learn from their firm revolutionary stance and their principle of Marxism-Leninism.

	The Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people insist on the battle slogan of "self-reliance, one hand holding a hoe, the other holding a gun, building socialism," relying on the boundless wisdom and strength of the people, transforming their country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. We must learn from their spirit of striving for progress and hard work.

	The Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people creatively apply Marxism-Leninism to their own revolutionary practice, launching a vigorous revolutionary movement throughout the country. This revolutionary movement is of great significance in preventing the restoration of capitalism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must seriously learn from the valuable experience they have provided in this regard.

	The Chinese people regard every achievement made by the Albanian people on their forward march as our own achievement. We are firmly convinced that the Albanian people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, will certainly achieve even more brilliant victories in the various fronts of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and will make even greater contributions to the common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

	Comrades, fellow fighters, our great motherland is currently in a great situation.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories and created unprecedented miracles.

	After more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have been fully mobilized, with overwhelming revolutionary might, overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and smashing the headquarters of the bourgeoisie that attempted to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. The great thought of Mao Zedong has been propagated on an unprecedented scale and is being studied and applied by hundreds of millions of people. The spiritual outlook of the people of the entire country has undergone tremendous changes. A large number of new revolutionary cadres of the proletariat have emerged. A large number of revolutionary cadres have undergone the test of the Cultural Revolution. The great People's Liberation Army has established new historical merits. The dictatorship of the proletariat has never been as consolidated as it is today. The people of all nationalities in our country have never been as united as they are today. Our socialist motherland has never been as prosperous, as flourishing, and as strong as it is today!

	At present, the people of the entire country are resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call, following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and adhering to Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "criticizing the self and criticizing revisionism." We are launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. At the same time, we must deepen the "support the army and love the people" movement, further consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and resolutely implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," further promoting the leapfrog development of our industrial and agricultural production. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought on every battlefield, and build our motherland into a red socialist power that will never change color.

	Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the first great revolution initiated by the proletariat itself in the history of the international communist movement, in a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is our great leader Chairman Mao's epoch-making contribution to Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao's theories on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, his theories, lines, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have greatly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism on the dictatorship of the proletariat, on class struggle in the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and on scientific socialism. This marks that Marxism-Leninism has developed to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong thought.

	Our Cultural Revolution has received the resolute support of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people. Comrade Enver Hoxha recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only of great significance to China but also to all revolutionary forces and the international communist and workers' movement throughout the world. 'The Albanian people, our Party and government, applaud and strongly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. We regard it as the greatest victory of the fraternal Chinese people following the armed revolutionary victory that led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, as our victory and the victory of all revolutionary peoples of the world, as a brilliant victory for Marxism-Leninism.' The Albanian Party of Labour and people's enthusiastic praise and high evaluation of our Cultural Revolution are a great encouragement to us.

	Comrades, fellow fighters: Both the Chinese and Albanian parties are genuine proletarian revolutionary parties established and developed according to the theories and styles of Marxism-Leninism, inheriting and carrying forward the path of the October Revolution, and adhering to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism. In the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our own countries, the two parties and the peoples of the two countries are fighting side by side. Our friendship is the greatest and most precious friendship in the world. Our united strength is unbreakable by any enemy; the enemy cannot break us, but we will break the enemy. For the common cause of Marxism-Leninism, for the common cause of the international proletariat and the revolutionary peoples of the world, the two parties and the peoples of the two countries will forever support and assist each other, forever fight together, and achieve victory together.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Chinese and Albanian parties and peoples should unite, all Marxist-Leninists in the world should unite, all revolutionary peoples in the world should unite, to overthrow imperialism, to overthrow modern revisionism, to overthrow the reactionaries of various countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without an exploitative system, must be established."

	The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong thought will certainly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, together with the fraternal Albanian people and all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world, struggle to smash the dark old world and create a bright new world!

	Long live the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Albania!

	Long live the heroic Albanian people!

	Long live the glorious Albanian Party of Labour!

	Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the close friend of the Chinese people!

	Long live our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao!

    李富春同志在延安欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团群众大会上讲话
    阿尔巴尼亚是世界无产阶级革命的一个可靠的根据地
    新华社延安七日电　李富春同志七日在延安欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的拉米兹·阿利雅同志，亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的同志们，战友们，同志们：
    今天，延安人民在具有伟大历史意义的中国共产党第七次代表大会的会议旧址举行盛大的集会，热烈欢迎我们的亲密战友拉米兹·阿利雅同志和阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的同志们。他们从亚得里亚海边带来了阿尔巴尼亚人民的深厚的革命友谊。我们谨向来自英雄阿尔巴尼亚的贵宾们，向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民，向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，向中国人民的亲密朋友、阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，致以崇高的敬意。
    延安是中国革命的圣地。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席率领中国工农红军胜利地完成二万五千里长征之后，在这里领导全中国人民进行了八年抗日战争和三年人民解放战争，终于取得了中国革命的胜利。在延安，毛主席写下了一系列当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义的光辉著作，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。延安人民曾经幸福地生活在毛主席身边，同全国人民一道，为中国革命的胜利进行了艰巨的斗争，有着光荣的革命传统。今天，我们能够在这里欢迎来自反帝反修斗争前线的阿尔巴尼亚的战友们，感到格外的亲切和无比的兴奋。
    我曾经在延安工作八年之久。当时，我亲眼看到多少革命青年，怀着一颗火热的心，从全国各地来到延安，参加毛主席所领导的革命队伍；我亲眼看到多少青年和中年干部在延安受到了伟大的毛泽东思想的教育，从这里奔赴各个根据地的战斗前线。我亲身体会到毛主席如何在中国革命的每个重大关头，作为伟大的革命舵手，掌握着中国革命的航船，冲破无数的惊涛骇浪，绕过种种的暗礁，沿着正确的道路前进。
    那个时刻的延安，是全国人民仰望的革命中心，是中国革命的最伟大的根据地，是一盏光芒四射的革命明灯。
    我们讲到当时的延安，也就很自然地联想到，今天的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，正象我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚是屹立在亚得里亚海边的坚不可摧的革命堡垒，是世界无产阶级革命的一个可靠的根据地。
    在伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在帝国主义和修正主义垂死挣扎的欧洲，树起一面壮丽的马克思列宁主义的红旗，照亮了欧洲无产阶级前进的道路，为世界无产阶级革命事业建立了不朽的功勋。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，不愧为马克思列宁主义的革命党。阿尔巴尼亚人民，不愧为伟大的人民。中国共产党和中国人民，以有阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民这样的战友，感到无比的自豪，并且把他们作为自己的学习榜样。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，面对帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围，不畏强暴，不怕困难，坚持走社会主义道路，充分表现了无产阶级的硬骨头精神。我们要学习他们这种顽强的革命意志和大无畏的英雄气概。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举反对帝国主义的旗帜，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。我们要学习他们这种忠于无产阶级国际主义的精神。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举反对现代修正主义的旗帜，同苏修叛徒集团、铁托叛徒集团和形形色色的工贼进行坚决的斗争，捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，对国际共产主义运动作出了杰出的贡献。我们要学习他们这种坚定的革命立场和马克思列宁主义的原则性。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持“自力更生，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，建设社会主义”的战斗口号，依靠人民群众无穷的智慧和力量，把自己的祖国从一个落后的农业国变为具有现代工业和集体化农业的先进的社会主义国家。我们要学习他们这种奋发图强，艰苦奋斗的精神。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于本国的革命实践，在全国开展了轰轰烈烈的革命化运动。这一革命化运动，对于防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，具有重大的意义。我们要认真地学习他们在这方面所提供的宝贵经验。
    中国人民把阿尔巴尼亚人民在前进道路上所取得的每一个成就，都看成是我们自己的成就。我们坚信，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，必将在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个战线取得更加辉煌的胜利，必将对反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同斗争作出更大的贡献。
    同志们，战友们，目前我们的伟大祖国一片大好形势。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了决定性的胜利，创造了史无前例的奇迹。
    经过一年多的文化大革命，亿万革命群众充分动员起来，以排山倒海般的革命威力，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打翻在地，粉碎了妄图实行反革命复辟的资产阶级司令部。伟大的毛泽东思想得到空前未有的大普及，为亿万群众所学习和运用，全国人民的精神面貌有了巨大变化。无产阶级的新生革命骨干大量地涌现出来。大批的革命干部经受了文化大革命的考验。伟大的人民解放军建立了新的历史功勋。我们的无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固。我国的各族人民从来没有象今天这样团结。我们的社会主义祖国从来没有象今天这样兴盛，这样繁荣，这样强大！
    目前，我们全国人民坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，遵照毛主席的“斗私，批修”的最新指示，正在掀起一个革命大批判、革命大联合和革命“三结合”的新高潮。同时，我们要深入开展“拥军爱民”运动，进一步巩固和加强无产阶级专政，并且坚决执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，进一步推动我们工农业生产的飞跃发展。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，把我们祖国建设成为红彤彤的永不变色的社会主义强国。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，是在国际共产主义运动史上，在无产阶级专政的国家里，由无产阶级自己发动的第一次大革命。这是我们伟大领袖毛主席对马克思列宁主义的划时代的贡献。毛主席提出的关于社会主义社会矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，极大地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，关于无产阶级专政时期阶级斗争的学说，关于科学社会主义的学说。这标志着马克思列宁主义已经发展到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    我国的文化大革命，得到了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚决支持。恩维尔·霍查同志最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界一切革命派以及国际共产主义和工人运动都具有十分重大的意义。”“阿尔巴尼亚人民，我们党和政府，欢呼和热烈支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命。我们把它看作是兄弟的中国人民继导致一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立的武装革命胜利之后的最伟大的胜利，看作是我们的胜利和全世界一切革命人民的胜利，看作是马克思列宁主义的辉煌胜利。”阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民对我国文化大革命的热情赞扬和高度评价，是对我们的极大的鼓舞。
    同志们，战友们：中阿两党都是按照马克思列宁主义的理论和风格建立起来的、继承和发扬十月革命道路的、坚持马克思列宁主义革命路线的真正的无产阶级革命党。中阿两党和两国人民，无论在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，无论在本国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中，都是并肩战斗的。我们之间的友谊，是世界上最伟大、最珍贵的友谊。我们的团结力量，是任何敌人也打不破的；敌人打不破我们，我们却要打破敌人。为了马克思列宁主义的共同事业，为了国际无产阶级和全世界革命人民的共同事业，我们两党、两国人民，将永远互相支持，互相援助，永远战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“中阿两党、两国人民团结起来，全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，一定遵照毛主席的教导，同兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一道，同全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民一道，为打碎黑暗的旧世界、创建一个光明的新世界而奋斗！
    中阿两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
