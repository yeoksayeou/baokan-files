The drums of war thunder, and the songs of victory resound. At this moment of great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, we, the revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the Beijing garrison troops, look back on our year-long battle journey. Our hearts surge with emotion, and our blood boils. Millions of hearts, vibrant and excited, burst forth with a single voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!

Over the past year and more, our country has undergone earth-shaking changes. Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have risen up, exposing China's Khrushchev, and smashing the counter-revolutionary line led by China's Khrushchev into pieces, causing it to collapse completely. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the entire nation and driving the new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production.

The literary and artistic front, like all other fronts, has presented an unprecedentedly brilliant and splendid scene. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, have taken up their pens as swords and spears to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line backed by China's Khrushchev. All the decayed old culture left over from the old society of the exploiting classes is being swept into the dustbin of history. The season of blossoming socialist new literature and art of the proletariat has arrived!

Over the past year, we, the revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the three services in Beijing, have, while fiercely attacking the revisionist literary and artistic black line, firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings on literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. We have followed the spirit of the "Summary of the Conference on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing" and have seriously, honestly, and diligently learned from Comrade Jiang Qing, the heroic fighter of the cultural revolution, and from the revolutionary model operas personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, we have striven to create heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, closely combining with the current struggle, and have created a batch of revolutionary literary and artistic programs welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, beginning to bear the fruits of literary and artistic revolution.

Through the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, we have deeply felt that the most fundamental and important thing in learning from Comrade Jiang Qing is to learn from her most loyal and resolute execution and defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line, to enthusiastically praise the great leader Chairman Mao, and to enthusiastically propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in the hearts of all the revolutionary people of China and the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of all the revolutionary people of China and the world. To praise the great leader Chairman Mao and to propagate the boundless Mao Zedong Thought is our most sacred, most glorious, and most honorable combat mission as proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic workers.

At this moment when the people of the entire country are solemnly commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we, with the deepest feelings, have taken a high combat posture and fought for two days and two nights to hastily compile and stage the large-scale song and dance "Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Publication of Chairman Mao's Brilliant Work 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'." We have enthusiastically sung the great victories of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. Chairman Mao's poems are an important part of Mao Zedong Thought. We have composed songs based on Chairman Mao's poems and have also composed a large number of songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations. We want to let Chairman Mao's voice spread across the five continents and resonate throughout the universe. We have previously created and performed the song and dance drama "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Ship" praising the great leader Chairman Mao and the song and dance drama "Revolutionary Historical Songs" praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which were once suppressed by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. This time, we have brought them back to the stage, singing and dancing enthusiastically, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The days of creation and rehearsal were very tense: time was tight, lines were many, and difficulties were great. What should we do? Everyone held the red book, reading aloud over and over again: "Resolutely carry out the decision, be prepared for sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." As soon as the comrades heard the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, they were instantly filled with strength. Our battle slogan is: the stage is the battlefield, and rehearsal is combat. As long as we have a breath, we will praise the great leader Chairman Mao and propagate the boundless Mao Zedong Thought! For the sake of letting the revolutionary people of the whole world hear the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and for the sake of letting the revolutionary people of the whole world grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we swear to be lifelong propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

Through the practice of the cultural revolution over the past year, we have more deeply realized that the focus of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the literary and artistic front is which class the literary works praise, which class's heroes are created, and which class's figures occupy the dominant position in literary works and on the literary stage.

The bourgeoisie once usurped the leadership of the literary and artistic departments and occupied the literary stage. Under the support and protection of China's Khrushchev, they fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, concocting all kinds of reactionary fallacies, filling the stage with emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, ladies, young masters, and young misses, causing a moment of demonic dance on the socialist literary stage, poisoning the people. Their purpose was to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism, create public opinion, and attempt to reverse the wheel of history.

We, the proletarian literary and artistic warriors, must thoroughly cleanse all the filthy things from the proletarian stage and not give them an inch of space. We must let the true creators of history, the heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers, fully occupy the literary stage! We must prominently and specially create the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the literary stage.

To create the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we have striven to learn from the revolutionary model operas in our artistic creation practice. In the large-scale song and dance "Long Live Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Literary and Artistic Line," we have included some excerpts from revolutionary model operas. Some actors who were not familiar with the art forms of Peking opera and ballet have, in order to bring the heroic images from the model operas into this program, worked day and night, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, washing their heads with cold water when tired, and eating a few steamed buns when hungry, learning and practicing as they go, working hard to master the excerpts from the model operas, and letting the heroic images stride proudly into this program. The performance of this large-scale song and dance has been warmly welcomed and supported by the broad audience.

The large-scale dramas "Huaishu Village" and "Night Battle on the Sea" were both created and performed before the cultural revolution. Because their political direction was correct, they were encouraged and welcomed by the broad audience. However, when we learned from the model operas, the light emitted by the towering heroic images in the model operas exposed the influence of the literary and artistic black line on these two plays. Compared with the steel-like, jade-like communist heroes Li Yuhe, Yang Zirong, Guo Jian'guang, and others, the characters in these two plays were not tall enough and carried some of the poison of the reactionary fallacies such as "heroes should have flaws." We have decided to revise these two plays. In the process of revision, we have taken the heroic figures in the model operas as our goal, using all artistic means, and doing our best to highlight the tall heroic images of the main characters in the two plays, removing the unhealthy things imposed on these characters by the literary and artistic black line, and greatly highlighting the heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the plays.

Through the practice of the cultural revolution over the past year, we have more deeply felt that to insist on the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics, we must truly make literature and art "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." The bourgeoisie proposed fallacies such as "indirect cooperation," "harmless" literature and art, and "rest" literature and art, all to oppose Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, to oppose literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics, to serve the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to attempt to make our literature and art detach from the current class struggle, achieving their evil purpose of serving bourgeois politics and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. We firmly do not agree! In the cultural revolution, we have used literature and art as a weapon to directly serve the current greatest politics—the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. We have taken up our pens as swords and spears, using the revolutionary stage as the battlefield, launching a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev. When revising and re-staging the drama "Huaishu Village," we highlighted the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, ruthlessly exposing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of fiercely opposing the five hundred million peasants' insistence on the socialist road, turning this play into a cannonball directly aimed at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We have also, in accordance with the situation of the struggle, timely compiled and staged revolutionary literary and artistic programs such as "Fiercely Fire at China's Khrushchev" and "Pull Down the Big Power-Holder Within the Party Who Is Taking the Capitalist Road," and organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, and troops, performing for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, using literature and art as a weapon, joining the battle, and throwing ourselves into the torrent of thorough criticism and the annihilation battle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and are led by China's Khrushchev.

Every victory we have achieved over the past year and more is a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, these victories are only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li. We must more seriously and diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, prominently and specially establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unconditionally and wholeheartedly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery class struggle, combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly temper and reform ourselves, and wholeheartedly serve the people, fighting for the defense of the dictatorship of the proletariat and for the creation of the most magnificent and brilliant proletarian new literature and art in human history for life!

    在毛主席文艺思想光辉照耀下胜利前进
    齐学青
    战鼓隆隆，凯歌阵阵，在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时候，在伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年的光辉节日里，我们驻京部队无产阶级革命派文体战士，回顾一年来的战斗历程，心潮汹涌，热血沸腾，千万颗振奋、激动的红心呵，迸发出一个共同的声音：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    文化大革命一年多来，我国出现了天翻地覆的变化。在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，亿万革命群众发动起来，揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命阵线打得七零八落，全面崩溃；毛泽东思想空前普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心，大大促进了全国人民的思想革命化，推动着工农业生产的新高涨。
    文艺战线同其他各条战线一样，出现了空前光辉灿烂的大好景象。革命文艺工作者在毛主席革命文艺路线指引下，以笔为刀枪，批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。旧社会遗留下来的一切剥削阶级的腐朽的旧文化，正在被统统扫进历史的垃圾箱，无产阶级的社会主义的新文艺百花盛开的季节已经到来！
    一年来，我们三军驻京部队革命文体战士，在猛烈攻击修正主义文艺黑线的同时，牢记毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的伟大教导，遵循《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》精神，认真地、老老实实地向文化革命的英勇战士江青同志学习，向江青同志亲自浇灌、栽培起来的革命样板戏学习，在毛主席的革命文艺路线指引下，努力塑造工农兵英雄形象，紧密配合现实斗争，创作出了一批受到广大工农兵群众欢迎的革命文艺节目，开始结出了文艺革命可喜的果实。
    通过一年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，我们深深体会到，学习江青同志，最根本最重要的，就是学习她最忠实、最坚决地执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，热情宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛主席是全中国和全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是全中国和全世界革命人民的命根子。歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是我们无产阶级革命文艺工作者最崇高、最光荣、最神圣的战斗任务。
    在全国人民隆重纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，我们满怀最最深厚的感情，以高昂的战斗姿态，奋战两天两夜，突击编排了大型歌舞《欢庆毛主席的光辉著作〈在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话〉发表二十五周年》，纵情歌颂毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。毛主席诗词是毛泽东思想的重要组成部分。我们以最最崇敬的心情，谱写了毛主席诗词联唱，同时还大量谱写了毛主席语录歌曲。我们就是要让毛主席的声音传遍五洲四海，响彻宇宙太空。我们过去创作、演出的歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌舞剧《毛主席来到我们军舰上》和歌颂毛主席革命路线伟大胜利的《革命历史歌曲表演唱》，曾经遭到一小撮反革命修正主义分子的扼杀。这次我们又重新把它们搬上舞台，纵情歌唱，热烈舞蹈，受到广大工农兵群众的极大欢迎。
    创作、排演的日子是十分紧张的：时间紧，台词多，困难大。怎么办？大家手捧红彤彤的宝书，一遍又一遍地高声朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”同志们一听到伟大领袖毛主席的教导，顿时浑身充满了力量。我们的战斗口号是：舞台就是战场，排演就是打仗。只要还有一口气，我们就要歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，就要宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想！为了让全世界革命人民听到伟大领袖毛主席的声音，为了让全世界革命人民掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们誓当一辈子毛泽东思想宣传员。
    通过一年来的文化大革命斗争实践，我们更加深刻地认识到，文艺作品歌颂哪个阶级，塑造哪个阶级的英雄人物，让哪个阶级的人物在文艺作品中，在文艺舞台上占统治地位，这是文艺战线上无产阶级同资产阶级搏斗的焦点。
    资产阶级老爷们一度窃踞了文艺部门领导权，霸占了文艺舞台，他们在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持和庇护下，疯狂反对毛主席的革命文艺路线，炮制了种种反动谬论，让帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐充塞舞台，社会主义的文艺舞台上一时群魔乱舞，毒害人民。他们的目的，是要为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道，大造舆论，妄图拉历史的车轮倒转。
    我们无产阶级文艺战士，就是要把那些乌七八糟的东西从无产阶级的舞台上彻底清除，不给他们有立锥之地。我们就是要让历史的真正创造者英雄的工农兵，全面地占领文艺舞台！就是要在文艺舞台上大树特树工农兵的英雄形象。
    为了塑造工农兵英雄形象，我们在艺术创作实践中努力向革命样板戏学习。我们创作、排练的大型歌舞《毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁》这个节目，里面要出现几个革命样板戏的片断。一些本来不熟悉京剧和芭蕾舞艺术形式的演员，为了把革命样板戏里的英雄形象移进这个节目，废寝忘食，昼夜不息，不怕苦、不怕累，困了用冷水淋淋头，饿了啃几口馒头，现学现练，刻苦琢磨。他们以最高的政治热情，最大的努力，克服种种困难，终于把革命样板戏片断学到了手，让英雄形象昂首阔步地进入了这个节目。这个大型歌舞的演出，受到了广大观众的热烈欢迎和支持。
    大型话剧《槐树庄》《夜海战歌》，都是在文化大革命以前创作并演出的，由于它们的政治大方向正确，受到广大观众的鼓励和欢迎。然而，在我们向革命样板戏学习的时候，样板戏里的那些顶天立地的英雄形象所发出的光芒，把这两出戏所受的文艺黑线的影响照得一清二楚。同坚如钢铁，洁如白玉的共产主义英雄形象李玉和、杨子荣、郭建光等比较，这两出戏所塑造的人物还不够高大，并且带有一些“英雄人物身上要有缺点”等反动谬论的流毒。我们决心重新修改这两出戏。在修改过程中，我们以革命样板戏里的英雄人物为奋斗目标，使用一切艺术手段，千方百计地突出两出戏中主要人物的高大英雄形象，清除了文艺黑线强加在这些人物身上的不健康东西，大大突出了剧中的工农兵代表人物的英雄形象。
    通过一年来的文化大革命斗争实践，我们更加深刻地体会到，坚持文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的方向，必须真正地把文艺“作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。资产阶级老爷们提出所谓“间接配合”、“无害”文艺、“休息”文艺等谬论，就是为了反对毛主席的文艺方向，反对文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为巩固无产阶级专政服务，妄图使我们的文艺脱离现实阶级斗争，以达到其为资产阶级政治服务，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道的罪恶目的，我们坚决不答应！在文化大革命中，我们用文艺这个武器，直接为当前最大的政治——两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争服务。我们拿起笔做刀枪，以革命舞台当战场，向中国的赫鲁晓夫发起了猛烈的攻击。在改编、重排话剧《槐树庄》时，我们突出了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，无情地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地反对五亿农民坚持走社会主义道路的滔天罪行，把这出戏修改成了直接射向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一颗炮弹。我们还配合斗争形势，及时编排了《向中国的赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火》、《把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拉下马》等革命文艺节目，同时组织毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、农村、部队，为广大工农兵演出，以文艺为武器，挥戈上阵，投入革命大批判的洪流，投入彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的围歼战。
    一年多来，我们取得的每一个胜利，都是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，毛泽东思想的胜利，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。但是，这些胜利，还只是万里长征的第一步。我们一定要更加认真、更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，长期地、无条件地、全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的阶级斗争中去，和工农兵相结合，不断地锻炼自己，改造自己，全心全意为人民服务，为捍卫无产阶级专政，为创造人类历史上最壮丽、最灿烂的无产阶级新文艺战斗终生！
