A few years ago, a strange wind blew through society, advocating that women should dress up and not be uniform. Suddenly, even old women started wearing colorful clothes.

The reason given was that "the Soviet Union says we don't distinguish between men and women."

The Chinese Khrushchev was the chief culprit who started this strange trend.

The Chinese Khrushchev has always been in awe of the lifestyle of the Soviet revisionists, envying it immensely, and going to great lengths to find "gold in the dung heap." Everywhere he went, he propagated: "The situation in the Soviet Union now is of course different from before. Everything there has become very beautiful. People often talk about life together, women put on rouge, lipstick, and wear diamond rings..." and so on. He also sighed deeply, saying that "talking about life in China is backward," and was indignant about it.

The Chinese Khrushchev was like a dog on a leash around his neck, following the Soviet revisionists and picking up their scraps.

Plagiarizing others and licking their leftovers is his biggest characteristic.

Is this just a small matter of life?

"Should we set up a marriage introduction agency in social organizations?"

You might not believe it, but these words were spoken by the high-ranking "official" Chinese Khrushchev himself.

"In power plants, there are more male comrades and fewer female comrades, making it difficult to find a partner," so the capitalist roaders in power within the party in our factory also started acting as matchmakers.

The dance hall was a marriage introduction agency, and textile factory female comrades were specially invited to dance. At that time, it was bustling and lively.

Comrades, this is not just a small matter of life; it is a life-and-death class struggle!

Often look at the dance floor in the auditorium. Do not forget the class struggle!

    妖为鬼蜮必成灾 	拣破烂
    前几年，社会上刮起一股妖风，提倡女的要打扮，不要清一色，顿时老太婆也穿起花衣服来了。
    为的是“苏联说我们男女不分”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫就是刮起这股妖风的罪魁祸首。
    中国赫鲁晓夫对苏修的一套生活方式从来就是五体投地，羡慕万分，极尽“屎里觅道”之能事。到处宣扬：“现在苏联的情况当然与那时不同，那里已经什么都变得很漂亮了。人民在一起经常讲生活，女人搽胭脂，抹口红，戴宝石戒指……”等等。还万分感叹地说什么“在中国讲生活是落后的”，为此愤愤不平。
    中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样在脖子上被拴了链条，跟在苏修脚后专拣破烂的哈叭狗。
    拾人牙慧，舐人余唾，就是他最大的特征。	决不是生活小事
    “是否在社会团体里设个介绍男女结婚的机构——婚姻介绍所。”
    你们可别不相信，这句话就是堂堂“官老爷”中国赫鲁晓夫亲口讲的。
    “发电厂男同志多，女同志少，要找对象很困难”，于是我厂党内走资本主义道路当权派也做起媒婆来了。
    舞厅就是介绍所，特地请了纺织厂女同志来跳舞。想当初，熙熙攘攘，好不“热闹”。
    同志们，这决不是什么生活小事，这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争啊！
    经常看看大礼堂中的跳舞池吧。别忘记了阶级斗争！
