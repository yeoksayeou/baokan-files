By a delegation led by Comrade Huang Wendan, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam visited Shanghai today. Accompanied by Shanghai Revolutionary Committee leaders and the leaders of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, Comrades Liao Zhengguo and Li Binshan, the delegation visited the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition.

When the delegation arrived at the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China, they were warmly welcomed by revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Comrade Huang Wendan listened attentively to the introduction of the proceedings of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the great achievements of our great leader Chairman Mao in the process of founding the great Communist Party of China. Comrade Huang Wendan said, "We are very happy to visit the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai. This is a place for revolutionary education for the people. I wish you to maintain and carry forward the revolutionary tradition, to build socialism better, and to make greater contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution."

During the visit to the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, Comrade Huang Wendan, after seeing the exhibition, told the revolutionary workers, "We have seen here the great achievements of China's socialist construction and scientific and technological progress. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and with the correct line of guidance, the working class can create all kinds of miracles. Every victory you achieve is a heavy blow to imperialism and capitalism, and it also strengthens our confidence in the victory of the people of South Vietnam."

According to the New China News Agency, Shanghai, October 15th, the delegation led by Comrade Huang Wendan visited the Shanghai Bicycle Factory, Shanghai Medical Instrument Factory, Shanghai Special Steel Pipe Factory, and Shanghai Yimin Food Factory. Everywhere they went, they were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary workers.

When the heroes from the front lines of the anti-American struggle in South Vietnam arrived at these factories, the workers beat drums, blew horns, and held the national flags of China and Vietnam and the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, lining the streets to welcome their comrades, enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Salute to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho!"

These factories' revolutionary workers, in order to better support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, have redoubled their efforts to complete the production tasks for Vietnam ahead of schedule. The heroes from South Vietnam, during their visit, saw the workers' selfless revolutionary spirit and various high-precision products, and after listening to the introductions by the representatives of these factories, they said excitedly: "We are fighting on different battlefields to annihilate American imperialism together! The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and striving for progress, is building its own country and supporting our struggle against American aggression for national salvation, making outstanding contributions. The two countries' comrades also exchanged gifts and badges with each other.

    这些工厂的革命职工为了更好地支援越南人民抗美救国战争，他们鼓足干劲提前完成了援越生产任务。越南南方的英雄们在参观中，看到职工们忘我的革命精神和生产的各种高级精密产品，以及听了这些工厂职工代表的介绍以后，激动地说：我们是在不同的战场上为消灭美帝国主义而共同战斗！中国工人阶级用毛泽东思想武装起来，以自力更生、艰苦奋斗、奋发图强的革命精神，来建设自己的国家，支援我们的抗美救国战争，作出了杰出的贡献。两国战友还互相赠送了纪念品和纪念章。
