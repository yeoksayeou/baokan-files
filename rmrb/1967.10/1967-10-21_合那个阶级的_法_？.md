Title: Whose "Law" Does It Benefit?

After the national liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev rushed to Tianjin and blathered on about how "today, capitalist exploitation is legal, the more the better, dividends should be increased." "How much money industrialists make is legal, I say it's legal no matter how much they make, all the colorful makeup, rouge and powder, feasting and drinking, are all legal." The Chinese Khrushchev kept saying "legal" this and "legal" that, but whose "law" does it benefit? In a word, it benefits the bourgeoisie's "law." "Law" is always a tool to protect the interests of a certain class. The exploiting class has its own "law," and the proletariat has its own law. Between opposing classes, there is fundamentally no common "law."

The capitalists of the Tianjin Carpet Factory No. 3 exploited the workers' entire labor fruits by nine-tenths before liberation. The capitalists' "colorful makeup" resulted in the workers' "tattered clothes"; the capitalists' "feasting and drinking" resulted in the workers' hunger and poverty. The workers' bitter tears and blood congealed into the capitalists' "rouge and powder"; the workers' bones piled up into the capitalists' tall buildings.

The Chinese Khrushchev is frantically advocating for "exploitation is legal," isn't this completely in cahoots with the capitalists?

    合那个阶级的“法”？
    在全国解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫急急忙忙跑到天津，胡说什么“今天资本主义剥削是合法的，越多越好，股息应该提高”。“工业家究竟赚多少钱合法，我说赚到什么程度都合法，花花绿绿，胭脂水粉，大吃大喝，都合法”。中国赫鲁晓夫左一个“合法”，右一个“合法”，这究竟合的是那一家的“法”？一句话，合的是资产阶级的“法”。“法”总是保护一定阶级利益的工具。剥削阶级有它自己的“法”，无产阶级也有自己的法。在对立的阶级之间，根本就不存在共同的“法”。
    天津地毯三厂的资本家，解放前剥削了工人全部劳动成果的十分之九。资本家的“花花绿绿”，造成了工人的破破烂烂；资本家的“大吃大喝”，造成了工人饥饿贫困。工人的辛酸血泪，凝成了资本家的“胭脂水粉”；工人的片片白骨，堆成了资本家座座高楼。
    中国赫鲁晓夫拚命鼓吹“剥削合法”，这不完全是和资本家一个鼻孔出气吗？
