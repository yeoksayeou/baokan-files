Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing triumphantly along the brilliant path of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "We must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." This is the basic guideline for guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that Chairman Mao has summarized for us.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Fighting selfishness means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the 'self' in one's mind. Criticizing revisionism means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and to struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul. This revolution aims to overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to thoroughly criticize and repudiate bourgeois ideology, to establish Mao Zedong Thought, to transform people's world outlook, to uproot the roots of revisionism, and to consolidate and strengthen our proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system.

Only by earnestly studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's great guideline of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and by correctly recognizing the fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, can we understand the profound significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only then can we grasp and apply Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, reduce blind actions, increase consciousness, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is a very long historical period. During this period, there is fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism.

The proletariat's seizure of political power and the overthrow of the system of exploitation by the exploiting classes do not necessarily take a long time. However, the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from the exploiting classes for thousands of years will take a very long time to disappear. We have confiscated the property of the landlord and bourgeoisie, but we cannot confiscate their reactionary ideas. They still have considerable influence in the ideological realm and may even be stronger than the proletariat for a certain period.

The core of the ideological system of the exploiting classes is selfishness, an "ego." Due to the thousands of years of private ownership, the influence of selfishness is deeply rooted. Although the old social system has been destroyed, as our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "the remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system always linger in people's minds and do not easily retreat." The bourgeoisie uses these remnants to corrupt the masses, to corrupt the younger generation, and to attempt to conquer people's hearts and struggle against the proletariat.

All class struggles are political struggles. The class struggle in the ideological realm ultimately aims to seize and consolidate political power. The ruling class of China's feudal society used Confucianism to consolidate their power. The bourgeoisie also wants to use the capitalist ideological system to consolidate their power. After the overthrow of the landlord and bourgeoisie's power, they will inevitably use their certain advantages in the ideological realm to sabotage the proletarian dictatorship and attempt to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao correctly points out: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the realm of ideology in our country will take a considerable amount of time to resolve. This is because the influence of the bourgeoisie and the old intellectuals from the old society will continue to exist in our country for a long time, and as a class ideology, it will continue to exist in our country for a long time. If one does not recognize this situation sufficiently, or does not recognize it at all, one will commit a grave error and will neglect the necessary ideological struggle."

The great active role of ideological factors in social development must not be underestimated. Old ideas serve the old economic base, reflect the demands of the reactionary classes, and hinder social development; new ideas serve the new economic base, reflect the demands of the advanced classes, and promote and accelerate social development.

In his later years, Engels once said that Marx and he had, for the most part, refuted historical idealism and expounded on the decisive role of economic factors in historical development. Later, some people distorted their principles, claiming that economic factors are the sole decisive factor, which is absurd. He pointed out: "The development of politics, law, philosophy, religion, literature, and art is based on economic development. However, they also influence each other and influence the economic base."

The greatest genius of proletarian thought in our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, has, using thorough dialectical materialism, made the most profound and penetrating exposition of the active role of ideological factors in the historical process for the first time.

Chairman Mao says: "A certain culture (as an ideological form of culture) is a reflection of the politics and economics of a certain society, and it also has a great influence on and impact on the politics and economics of a certain society; while the economy is the base, politics is the concentrated expression of the economy." This is a very important summary by Chairman Mao on the issue of historical materialism.

In his brilliant work "On Contradiction," Chairman Mao attaches great importance to the role of spiritual things. He says: "Productive forces, practice, and the economic base generally manifest as the main decisive role, and whoever does not acknowledge this is not a materialist. However, under certain conditions, productive relations, theory, and the superstructure also turn to manifest as the main decisive role, and this must also be acknowledged." "We acknowledge that in the overall historical development, material things determine spiritual things, and social existence determines social consciousness; but at the same time, we also acknowledge and must acknowledge the reactive role of spiritual things, the reactive role of social consciousness on social existence, and the reactive role of the superstructure on the economic base. This is not a violation of materialism but is a way to avoid mechanical materialism and uphold dialectical materialism."

The major principles that Chairman Mao put forward decades ago are still a powerful ideological weapon for us today in continuing the revolutionary struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In the more than a decade since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Party, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has waged many struggles and criticisms against the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm and achieved great victories. As the class struggle deepens, the bourgeoisie increasingly feels that it is no longer so easy for them to personally lead the seizure of power from the proletariat. They more urgently need to find and cultivate agents within our Party to achieve their evil purposes. Now, people are already very clear that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their leader, are the agents of the forces aiming to restore capitalism within the Party. They spare no effort to seize the ideological realm, vigorously promote and maintain the ideology and culture of the exploiting classes that pave the way for the restoration of capitalism, and fiercely protect the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie.

From the criticism of "The Secret History of the Palace" to the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," this long and fierce class struggle fully proves this point.

Chairman Mao, in his series of great works, in the "Some Questions on the Current Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside" personally drafted by him, in the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, and in the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," clearly stipulates that to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, it is necessary to criticize and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Chairman Mao also points out to us that we must fully mobilize the masses, raise the consciousness of the broad masses of the people, thoroughly expose and criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, expose and criticize the reactionary ideology of the bourgeoisie in the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing circles, and seize the leadership in these cultural realms.

The great theory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao and the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao have solved the fundamental issue of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, opening up a path for the international communist movement to carry the socialist revolution through to the end and transition from socialism to communism. In the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism, a new and great milestone has been established.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has been raging for more than a year, has exposed and overthrown the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their leader, and has destroyed the bourgeois headquarters, achieving great victories. Thus, the greatest hidden danger within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus has been eliminated, and the greatest obstacle to the thorough criticism of the ideology of the exploiting classes has been removed.

At present, we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," and under the guidance of this great policy, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We have already destroyed the bourgeois headquarters. To consolidate this victory and develop this victory, we must, in the realms of politics, ideology, and theory, thoroughly criticize these representatives of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, we must closely combine the great criticism of the revolution with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our own units, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the revisionist line that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have implemented in the realms of politics, economics, ideology, and culture, eliminate their reactionary influence, and change all the things that are not suitable for the socialist system and conducive to the restoration of capitalism. In this way, the broad masses' ability to identify and resist revisionism will be further enhanced, and the foundation for anti-revisionism and guarding against revisionism will be solidified.

To better criticize revisionism and to transform our world outlook, we must fiercely fight against "selfishness." Comrade Lin Biao points out: "Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two ideologies and two world outlooks of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has never been as sharp, as fierce, and as profound as it is now, touching the soul of every individual. All revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, insist on breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, and firmly establish the spirit of selflessness and dedication. As Chairman Mao teaches us, "From this point of view, one can become a great benefactor to the people. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as one has this spirit, one is a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended low-level interests, and a person who benefits the people." Only in this way can we eliminate the conditions for the production of revisionism, uproot the roots of revisionism. This is a matter of great importance for the fate of the country and the future of the world, a matter of great importance for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years.

After the October Revolution, Lenin said: "The historical period in which we find ourselves is a period of struggle between us and the world bourgeoisie, which is many times stronger than us. We must, during this period, firmly hold onto revolutionary construction, and in the realms of military affairs, especially ideology and education, struggle against the bourgeoisie. Over the decades, the working class has formed its own habits, customs, and beliefs in the struggle for political freedom. We must use all these habits, customs, and thoughts as tools to educate all laboring people."

Comrade Lin Biao points out: "We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take 'fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism' as the guideline, and strengthen the ideological education of military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. We must establish various study classes, with the center establishing them, the localities establishing them, and various revolutionary mass organizations also establishing them, turning the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Through study, we will help our old cadres, new cadres, and revolutionary successors to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, raise their ideological and political level, and contribute to the people."

In the ideological construction of the revolutionary ranks, educating cadres is a very important aspect.

In a certain sense, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a movement to educate cadres. Most revolutionary cadres have been well tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must unite all cadres who can be united. For cadres who have made mistakes of varying degrees, we must educate them all. Cadres who have made mistakes should regard the serious criticism of the masses toward themselves as the best help, link it with the practice of class struggle, link it with their own experiences and lessons, study and apply Chairman Mao's works earnestly, correct their mistakes, raise their understanding of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and contribute their strength in the great criticism of the revolution and the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units.

We must strengthen the ideological education of revolutionary youth and Red Guards, instill Mao Zedong Thought into them, and help them grow healthily in the struggle.

Revolutionary youth and Red Guards have played a vanguard role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the transformation of world outlook is a long and arduous process. One must correctly treat oneself, especially value studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in the great storms and waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the process of learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, strive to temper oneself into a reliable successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Engels once said about old traditions, "Traditions are a great obstacle, the inertia of history, but because they are passive, they must be destroyed."

Feudal society for thousands of years, capitalist society for hundreds of years. These social systems have already or are being destroyed. The ideology that serves these social systems has already rotted to the core. Scientific communism, starting from the "Communist Manifesto," is only over a hundred years old. But it is a new and invincible force. As Chairman Mao said: "The ideological system and social system of communism are surging across the world with the force of a mountain collapse and the power of a thunderbolt, retaining their beautiful youth." With the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, with the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we have full confidence to use the proletarian world outlook of thorough Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to defeat all the ideology of the exploiting classes and achieve the great victory of communism throughout the world!

    大立毛泽东思想的伟大革命
　　《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十五期社论
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，正在沿着毛泽东思想的光辉道路，胜利前进。
      我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：要斗私，批修。这是毛主席给我们概括出来的指导无产阶级文化大革命的基本纲领。
    林彪同志说：“斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的‘私’字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。”
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。这场大革命，就是要打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，改造人的世界观，挖掉修正主义根子，以巩固和加强我们的无产阶级专政，巩固和发展社会主义制度。
    只有认真学习和深刻理解毛主席提出的“斗私，批修”的伟大纲领，正确地认识无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的，才能认清无产阶级文化大革命的深远意义，才能领会和掌握毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，减少盲目性，增强自觉性，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    无产阶级专政是一个很长的历史时期。在这个历史时期中，充满着无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的激烈斗争。
    无产阶级夺取政权，推翻剥削阶级的所有制，时间不一定要很长。但是，剥削阶级几千年遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，则需要很长很长的时间才能消失。我们没收了地主资产阶级的财产，但是不能没收他们的反动思想。他们在思想领域里还占有相当的势力，甚至在一定时期内比无产阶级还要强大。
    剥削阶级思想体系的核心，是利己主义，是一个“私”字。由于几千年的私有制度，这种利己主义的影响是根深蒂固的。旧的社会制度消灭了，但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们的，“反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的”。资产阶级就是利用这些东西来腐蚀群众，腐蚀青年一代，企图征服人心，同无产阶级作斗争。
    一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争。思想领域里的阶级斗争，归根到底，是为了夺取政权和巩固政权。中国封建社会的统治阶级，用孔孟之道巩固他们的政权。资产阶级也要用资本主义的思想体系巩固他们的政权。在地主资产阶级的政权被推翻以后，他们必然要拚命地利用自己在思想阵地上占有的某种优势，来破坏无产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义。
    毛主席完全正确地指出：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。这是因为资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要在我国长期存在，作为阶级的意识形态，还要在我国长期存在。如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”
      思想因素对于社会发展的巨大能动作用，是不可低估的。旧的思想，是为旧的经济基础服务的，反映了反动阶级的要求，对社会的发展起着阻碍作用；新的思想，是为新的经济基础服务的，反映了先进阶级的要求，对社会的发展起促进、加速的作用。
    恩格斯在他的晚年曾经谈到，前些时候马克思和他为了主要地反对历史唯心主义，较多地阐述了经济因素对于历史发展的决定作用；后来有人把他们的原理加以歪曲，说仿佛经济因素是唯一决定的因素，这是荒诞无稽的。他指出：“政治、法律、哲学、宗教、文学、艺术等的发展是以经济发展为基础的。但是，它们又都互相影响并影响到经济基础。”
    当代最伟大的无产阶级天才思想家毛泽东同志，用彻底的唯物辩证法，对思想因素在历史进程中的能动作用，第一次作出了最深刻、最精辟的阐明。
    毛主席说：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济；而经济是基础，政治则是经济的集中的表现。”这是毛主席在历史唯物论问题上的一个非常重要的概括。
    毛主席在《矛盾论》这一光辉著作中非常重视精神的东西的作用。他说：“生产力、实践、经济基础，一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，谁不承认这一点，谁就不是唯物论者。然而，生产关系、理论、上层建筑这些方面，在一定条件之下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用，这也是必须承认的。”“我们承认总的历史发展中是物质的东西决定精神的东西，是社会的存在决定社会的意识；但是同时又承认而且必须承认精神的东西的反作用，社会意识对于社会存在的反作用，上层建筑对于经济基础的反作用。这不是违反唯物论，正是避免了机械唯物论，坚持了辩证唯物论。”
    毛主席在几十年前提出的这些重大原理，仍然是我们今天在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命斗争的一个强有力的思想武器。
    中华人民共和国成立十几年来，我们党在毛主席的领导下，在思想领域里，对资产阶级开展了多次的批判和斗争，取得了伟大胜利。随着阶级斗争的深入，资产阶级越来越感觉到由他们自己亲自挂帅向无产阶级夺权，已经不那么容易了。他们更加需要在我们党内寻找、培植代理人，来达到他们的罪恶目的。现在，人们已经十分清楚，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就是资本主义复辟势力在党内的代理人。他们为了把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，千方百计地抓意识形态，拚命地鼓吹和维护为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的剥削阶级的思想和文化，拚命地保护资产阶级反动学术“权威”。
    从批判《清宫秘史》到批判《海瑞罢官》，这个长期的激烈的阶级斗争，充分地证明了这一点。
    毛主席在他的一系列的伟大著作中，在他亲自主持制定的《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》、中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》中明确地规定，要巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，就必须批判和打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。毛主席并且给我们指出了，要充分发动群众，提高广大人民群众的自觉性，彻底揭露和批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”，揭露和批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。
    毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大理论，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，解决了在无产阶级专政下继续革命这样一个根本问题，为国际共产主义运动开辟了把社会主义革命进行到底、从社会主义过渡到共产主义的航道，在马克思列宁主义发展史上，树立了崭新的伟大的里程碑。
    在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，一年多来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，揭露和打倒了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，摧毁了资产阶级司令部，已经取得了伟大的胜利。这样，就消除无产阶级专政机构内部最大的隐患，也扫除了对剥削阶级意识形态进行彻底批判的最大障碍。　　　　　　　　
    当前，我们要坚决响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，在这个伟大方针的指引下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们已经摧毁了资产阶级司令部。为了巩固这个胜利，发展这个胜利，我们还必须从政治上、思想上、理论上把这些资产阶级代表人物批深批透，批倒批臭。同时，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改紧密地结合起来，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在政治、经济、思想、文化各个领域推行的一套修正主义的东西，来一个大破除，肃清他们的反动影响，把那些不适应社会主义制度、便于资本主义复辟的东西统统改掉。这样，就会进一步提高广大群众对修正主义的识别能力和抵制能力，反修、防修就有了牢固的群众基础。
    为了更好地批修，为了改造自己的世界观，我们就必须狠斗“私”字。林彪同志指出：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级和资产阶级两种思想、两种世界观的斗争，从来没有象现在这样尖锐，这样激烈，这样深刻地触及到每一个人的灵魂。一切无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚持破私立公，牢固树立毫不利己专门利人的精神，毫无自私自利之心的精神。象毛主席所教导我们的那样，“从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。只有这样，才能杜绝修正主义产生的条件，挖掉修正主义的根子。这是关系到国家命运和世界前途的大事，是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。
    在十月革命后，列宁说过：“我们所处的历史时期是我们同比我们强大许多倍的世界资产阶级进行斗争的时期，我们应当在这个时期内坚持革命建设，在军事方面，尤其是在思想方面、教育方面同资产阶级进行斗争。几十年来工人阶级在争取政治自由的斗争过程中形成了自己的习惯、风气和信念，我们要把这一切习惯、风气和思想用作教育全体劳动人民的工具”。
    林彪同志指出：“我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，用‘斗私，批修’这四个字为纲，加强对军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。通过学习，帮助我们的老干部，新干部和革命小将，活学活用毛泽东思想，改造自己头脑里各种非无产阶级思想，提高思想政治水平，为人民立新功。”
    在革命队伍的思想建设中，教育干部，是一个很重要的方面。
    无产阶级文化大革命，从一定意义上说，是一个教育干部的运动。大多数革命干部在无产阶级文化大革命中，得到了很好的锻炼。我们要团结一切可以团结的干部。对于犯不同程度上的错误的干部，都要一律加以教育。犯了错误的干部，应该把群众对自己严肃的批判，看作是对自己最好的帮助，要联系阶级斗争的实践，联系自己的经验教训，活学活用毛主席著作，认真改正错误，提高对无产阶级专政下的革命的认识，在革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改中贡献自己的力量。
    要加强革命青少年和红卫兵的思想教育，向他们灌输毛泽东思想，帮助他们在斗争中健康地成长。
    革命的青少年和红卫兵，在无产阶级文化大革命中起了先锋作用。但是，世界观的改造，是一个长期的、艰巨的过程。一定要正确地对待自己，要特别重视活学活用毛主席著作，在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，在向工农兵学习的过程中，努力把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    恩格斯在谈到旧传统的时候曾经说过，“传统是一种巨大的阻力，是历史的惰性力，但是由于它只是消极的，所以一定要被摧毁”。
    封建社会几千年，资本主义社会几百年。这种社会制度已经和正在灭亡。为这种社会制度服务的思想已经腐败透顶。科学共产主义从《共产党宣言》算起，才一百多年。但这是新生的无敌的力量。正如毛主席所说：“共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有光焰无际、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就有充分的信心，用彻底的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的无产阶级宇宙观，战胜一切剥削阶级的思想，夺取共产主义在全世界的伟大胜利！
