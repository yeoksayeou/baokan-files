Following the great leader Chairman Mao's guidance to walk the path of combining with workers and peasants, some revolutionary young people from Beijing volunteer to go to Inner Mongolia as ordinary commune members.

	These revolutionary young people, while fiercely criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, bravely fight against the "selfish" thoughts in their own minds, further promoting the revolutionization of their thinking. They are determined to go among the workers and peasants, to the most arduous places, to temper themselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: Following the brilliant path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao for revolutionary young people—to combine with workers and peasants—some revolutionary young people from several middle schools in Beijing set off on October 9th to the Xilin Gol League's West Ujimqin Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to become ordinary commune members and herdsmen in the Baiyinbaolige People's Commune.

	These revolutionary young people, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have engaged in self-criticism, criticized revisionism, and promoted the revolutionization of their thinking. They have deeply realized that the path of combining with workers and peasants, as indicated by Chairman Mao, is the only correct path for revolutionary young people. They loudly declare: Voluntarily go to the countryside to be farmers and commune members, go to the three great revolutionary struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, go among the workers and peasants, go to the most arduous places, and temper ourselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. This revolutionary action of theirs represents the direction of revolutionary young people and has been warmly praised by the people.

	These revolutionary young people are high school and junior high school students from Beijing's 25th Middle School, 22nd Middle School, Girls' 8th Middle School, and Girls' 12th Middle School. Some are members of the school revolutionary committees, some are leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, and some are active members in studying Chairman Mao's works. They are all revolutionary pioneers tempered in the Cultural Revolution.

	During the Cultural Revolution, they dared to think, dared to act, and dared to revolutionize, bravely fighting against selfish thoughts and criticizing revisionism. They rebelled against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, and rebelled against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. They fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and fought against the "selfish" thoughts in their own minds, undergoing a tremendous change in their spiritual outlook. They firmly declare that they will not become successors of revisionism but will become steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Chairman Mao teaches revolutionary youth: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually does combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these revolutionary young people repeatedly studied this great teaching of Chairman Mao in "The Direction of the Youth Movement," realizing that the only correct path for revolutionary young people is to listen to Chairman Mao's words and combine with workers and peasants. Thus, they made up their minds to go to the mountains and countryside, to the three great revolutionary struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, to the workers and peasants, to the most arduous places, to the places where the motherland needs them the most, to temper themselves. When they proposed to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee to go to the countryside to be farmers and commune members, they immediately received enthusiastic support, encouragement, and help.

	With the help and arrangement of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and relevant departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, these revolutionary young people have recently been approved to go to the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia to be herdsmen and commune members. The young people excitedly said: This is the greatest test and greatest care for us. Although we are just fledgling birds learning to fly, we are definitely able to withstand the test of storms and snow, and become stronger through struggle.

	Before setting off, the young people came to the Golden Water Bridge in front of Tiananmen, facing the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and raised the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to swear:

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who have shown us the brilliant path. We will always listen to your words, combine with workers and peasants for life, and become steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We resolutely respond to your great call, taking "criticize selfishness, criticize revisionism" as the guideline, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will always be loyal to you, always loyal to your brilliant thoughts, always loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. We will definitely carry on the baton of Mao Zedong Thought and ensure that the red mountains and rivers of our great socialist motherland will never change color!

	The parents of these revolutionary young people, through the Cultural Revolution, have raised their ideological awareness. Most of them enthusiastically support and encourage their children to go to the countryside to be herdsmen and commune members, correctly educating their children to listen to Chairman Mao's words, and go wherever Chairman Mao points. Some parents have various concerns, and the young people actively do ideological work for their parents, making their parents happily send them to the countryside. Many parents and the young people's comrades-in-arms in the Cultural Revolution also sent them revolutionary treasures—Chairman Mao's works—before they set off. Many revolutionary young people from middle schools have expressed that they will learn from these revolutionary comrades who are going to the countryside, firmly walking the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

　　遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导走同工农群众相结合的道路
　　北京一些革命小将自愿到内蒙当普通社员
    这些革命小将在狠批党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的同时，勇于同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，进一步促进了思想革命化。他们决心到工农群众中去，到最艰苦的地方去，把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    新华社十日讯　遵照伟大领袖毛主席给革命的知识青年指引的光辉道路——与工农群众相结合的道路，北京一些中学的革命小将，在十月九日前往内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟西乌珠穆沁旗白音宝力格公社，当普通的社员，普通的牧民。
    这些革命小将，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，斗私，批修，促进了思想革命化，深刻地认识到毛主席指引的知识青年与工农群众相结合的道路，是革命知识青年应该走的唯一正确的道路。他们响亮地提出：自愿下乡当农民当社员，到阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命斗争中去，到工农群众中去，到最艰苦的地方去，把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命事业接班人。他们的这一革命行动，代表了革命知识青年的方向，受到人们热烈的赞扬。
    这些革命小将，是北京二十五中、二十二中、女八中、女十二中的高中和初中的学生。他们有的是学校革命委员会的成员，有的是革命群众组织的负责人，有的是学习毛主席著作的积极分子，他们都是在文化大革命运动中锻炼出来的革命闯将。
    在文化大革命中，他们敢想、敢闯、敢革命，勇于斗私，批修，造了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造了资产阶级反动路线的反，狠批了反革命修正主义的教育路线，狠斗了自己头脑里的“私”字，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。他们坚定地说，决不做修正主义的接班人，要做坚强的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    毛主席教导革命青年说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，这些革命小将反复学习了毛主席在《青年运动的方向》里的这一伟大教导，认识到革命的知识青年应该走的唯一正确的道路，就是听毛主席的话，与工农群众相结合。于是，他们下定决心，上山下乡，到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命斗争中去，到工农群众中去，到最艰苦的地方去，到祖国最需要的地方去，锻炼自己。当他们向北京市革命委员会提出下乡当农民当社员的要求时，立刻得到热情的支持、鼓励和帮助。
    在北京市革命委员会和内蒙古自治区有关部门的帮助安排下，这些革命小将最近被批准到内蒙古牧区当牧民当社员。小将们非常激动地说：这是对我们的最大考验，最大关怀。我们虽是初学飞翔的雏鹰，但是我们一定能经得起暴风雪的考验，在斗争中锻炼得更加坚强。
    行前，小将们来到天安门前的金水桥上，面对伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》宣誓：
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您给我们指引了光辉的大道，我们永远听您的话，一辈子与工农群众相结合，做坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们坚决响应您的伟大号召，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，我们一定接好毛泽东思想的班，使我们伟大的社会主义祖国的红色江山永不变色！
    这些革命小将的家长，在文化大革命中提高了思想觉悟，听到自己的子女下乡当牧民当社员，多数人都热情支持和鼓励，正确地教育自己的子女，好好听毛主席的话，毛主席指到那里，就奔到那里。有的家长思想上有这样那样的顾虑，小将们就积极地给家长做思想工作，使家长们愉快地送他们下乡。许多家长和小将们在文化大革命中的战友，还在行前给这些小将送了革命宝书——毛主席著作。许多中学的革命小将纷纷表示，要向这些下乡的革命战友学习，坚定地走毛主席指引的道路。
