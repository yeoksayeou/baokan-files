The Chinese embassy staff in Indonesia, who were brutally attacked by the Indonesian reactionaries, severely injured, and completely cut off from communication with their motherland, have bravely continued their struggle despite all difficulties. This fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of the Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong.

According to reports, on the 3rd, the Chinese embassy staff in Indonesia, bearing the wounds inflicted by the Indonesian thugs and reactionary police, with bandages on their heads and blood-stained clothes, stood together in front of the Chinese embassy, which had been thoroughly destroyed by the Indonesian reactionaries. With immense anger, they protested and condemned the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries' frenzied anti-China actions. As they protested, they shouted slogans hailing the great leader Chairman Mao. Thousands of Jakarta residents crowded the streets in front of the Chinese embassy, witnessing the injuries of the Chinese embassy staff and listening to their strong protests and condemnations of the Indonesian reactionaries' anti-China violence.

The Indonesian reactionary government is terrified of the Chinese embassy staff's brave struggle. They ordered reactionary soldiers and police to brandish rifles at the Chinese diplomats, attempting to threaten and force them to stop their struggle. However, these brave Chinese diplomats firmly rejected and rebuked these threats. To prevent the Indonesian people from coming to hear the Chinese diplomats' just protests, the Indonesian reactionary government also blocked the traffic around the Chinese embassy, causing a long line of vehicles stretching for two miles.

The Chinese embassy staff also lodged a strong protest with the Director of the Asian-Pacific Division of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Supazo, regarding the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China violence.

According to reports, the brave struggle of the Chinese embassy staff in Indonesia has drawn the warm attention of the ambassadors and diplomatic staff from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Afghanistan, Syria, Cuba, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stationed in Jakarta.

    心红志坚　不畏强暴　斗志昂扬
    我驻印尼使馆人员英勇斗争大义凛然
    充分表现了用伟大毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的英雄气概
    据新华社四日讯　据外国通讯社报道：遭到印度尼西亚反动派疯狂袭击、身负重伤、和祖国的联系完全中断的中国驻印尼大使馆的外交人员，排除万难，继续坚持斗争，表现了用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国外交人员的威武不屈的英雄气概。
    据报道，三日，中国驻印尼大使馆的外交人员带着被印尼暴徒和反动军警毒打的伤痕，头扎绷带，身着血衣，齐立在遭到印尼反动派彻底破坏的中国大使馆的门前，以无比的愤怒抗议和谴责印尼反动派疯狂反华的滔天罪行。他们一面抗议，一面高呼伟大领袖毛主席万岁的口号。数以千计的雅加达居民拥挤在中国大使馆前面的街道上，目睹了中国大使馆外交人员的伤势，听取了他们对印尼反动派反华暴行的强烈抗议和谴责。
    印尼反动政府对中国外交人员的英勇斗争怕得要死，指使反动军警向中国外交人员挥动步枪，施加威胁，企图强迫他们停止斗争，但遭到英勇的中国外交人员的严词驳斥和坚决拒绝。印尼反动政府为阻止印尼人民前来听取中国外交人员的正义抗议，还封锁了中国大使馆附近的交通，使街上阻塞的车辆排成一字长蛇阵，长达二英里。
    中国大使馆的外交人员还就印尼反动政府的反华暴行，向印尼外交部亚洲太平洋司司长苏帕佐提出了愤怒的抗议。
    据报道，中国驻印尼大使馆的外交人员的英勇斗争，受到了越南民主共和国、阿富汗、叙利亚、古巴和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等国驻雅加达使节和外交官员的热情关注。
