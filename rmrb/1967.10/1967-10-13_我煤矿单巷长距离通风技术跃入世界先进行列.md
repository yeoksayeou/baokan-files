Our coal mine's single-tunnel long-distance ventilation technology leaps into the world's advanced ranks

The Shandong Taozhuang Coal Mine used extremely ordinary small fans and general-specification rubber air ducts to fully supply the air needed for construction, successfully completing a 2,880-meter-long transportation tunnel excavation project. This opens up a broad prospect for long-distance ventilation in China's mining and railway tunnel engineering.

Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future."

The ventilation workers of the Taozhuang Coal Mine, following Chairman Mao's teachings, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, displayed a fearless spirit of creation. Using extremely ordinary small fans and general-specification rubber air ducts, they advanced China's single-tunnel long-distance ventilation technology to the world's advanced level.

These ordinary workers, under ordinary material conditions, created extraordinary achievements, proving a timeless truth: the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience. Once armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, they summarize and apply their rich practical experience, and can create any miracle.

These revolutionary fighters kicked out foreign dogmas, broke old frameworks, and did not rely on bourgeois "authorities'" "theories," but were guided by Chairman Mao's great thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. They diligently checked the air ducts from head to tail every day, capturing extremely small air leaks that had never been noticed before, and eliminating them in every possible way. They finally created the world's first air duct that is basically airtight. This made the imperialist and revisionist coal mine ventilation "authorities" pale in comparison!

Their creation is worth celebrating. Their experience is worth promoting. But first, we must learn their spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan, during the great proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary rebels of the Taozhuang Coal Mine under the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau, high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, broke free from the shackles of foreign frameworks, and smashed the heavy obstacles of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In the single-tunnel excavation project, they used an 11-horsepower ordinary small fan and a 500-millimeter-diameter general-specification rubber air duct to fully supply the air needed for construction, successfully completing a 2,880-meter-long transportation tunnel excavation project. This made China's single-tunnel long-distance ventilation technology leap into the world's advanced ranks, opening up a broad prospect for long-distance ventilation in China's mining and railway tunnel engineering.

The revolutionary achievement of the Taozhuang Coal Mine's proletarian rebels is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a victory of their implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Taozhuang Coal Mine's proletarian rebels increased the single-tunnel ventilation distance to 2,880 meters, completing the excavation of this transportation tunnel, which is a first in China. If the tunnel distance were to be longer, it is estimated that the ventilation distance could be extended to about 4,000 meters. Single-tunnel long-distance ventilation, in some imperialist and revisionist countries, has also reached 3-4 kilometers, but they either use multiple fans in series or use super-large fans and large-specification air ducts for ventilation. However, the Taozhuang Coal Mine in China uses an extremely ordinary 11-horsepower small fan and a general-specification rubber air duct, with an average ventilation distance of 261 meters per horsepower, far surpassing the old imperialist countries with several decades of coal mine ventilation "theory" and the Soviet revisionists. In preventing air leaks and reducing resistance, the proletarian rebels of the Taozhuang Coal Mine also used practice to refute the fallacies of the imperialist and revisionist coal mine ventilation "authorities." The Soviet revisionist coal mine ventilation "authorities" believed that the air leak rate per 100 meters of air duct is at least around 10%, while the air leak rate per 100 meters of the Taozhuang Coal Mine's air duct is only 0.328%, basically eliminating air leaks, and the air duct's ventilation resistance is also greatly reduced. All these achievements greatly boosted the morale of China's proletarian rebels, thoroughly refuted the slander of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China "disrupted production," and proved that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces.

Recently, the Ministry of Coal Industry organized relevant personnel to conduct a comprehensive appraisal of the advanced technology created by the Taozhuang Coal Mine. The appraisal result shows that the air supply at the air duct's inlet is 80.6 cubic meters per minute. After nearly 6 kilometers, the effective air volume at the air duct's outlet at the excavation face is still 73.2 cubic meters per minute. The average air supply per excavation worker per minute far exceeds the national standard.

In the process of creating single-tunnel long-distance ventilation, the Taozhuang Coal Mine's proletarian rebels explored a series of new technical data, laying the foundation for establishing China's own coal mine ventilation theory. The Taozhuang Coal Mine saved tens of millions of yuan for the state by not opening an auxiliary ventilation tunnel in this project and accelerated the construction speed of the mine. If this experience is widely promoted in coal mines and other mining industries, railway tunnels, and other projects across the country, it will save the state a large amount of funds, manpower, and materials, which is of great significance for accelerating the construction of China's basic industries and transportation.

The main creators of the 2,880-meter single-tunnel long-distance ventilation are ordinary ventilation workers. They said: Without Mao Zedong Thought, without the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there would be no 2,880 meters.

To achieve single-tunnel long-distance ventilation, the key is to create an air duct that is basically airtight. In the past, the air leak rate per 100 meters of a 500-600-meter-long air duct was generally above 10%. Now, to make a 2,880-meter-long air duct basically airtight is an unprecedented arduous and heavy task facing the ventilation workers. However, the workers firmly believed: As long as we arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we can create any miracle! They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, and cherished the air duct like their own eyes. They checked it from head to tail every day, discovered, and captured extremely small air leaks that had never been noticed before, and eliminated them in every possible way. Finally, they created the world's first air duct that is basically airtight.

The ventilation workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause. They day and night used their blood, sweat, wisdom, and intelligence to strive for the realization of single-tunnel long-distance ventilation. However, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, from the beginning of the project, maliciously obstructed it. When the air duct advanced to 2,500 meters and victory was in sight, this small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party even issued an order to stop the advance, attempting to strangle the single-tunnel long-distance ventilation. The workers, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on "harmful revolutionary leadership should not be unconditionally accepted but should be resolutely resisted," rose up to criticize them, engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle, and thoroughly smashed their evil plot to sabotage single-tunnel long-distance ventilation, successfully completing the task.

　　毛泽东思想武装起来的人什么人间奇迹都能创造出来！
　　我煤矿单巷长距离通风技术跃入世界先进行列
　　山东陶庄煤矿用极其普通的小型扇风机和一般规格的胶质风筒，充分供应施工所需的风量，顺利完成一条二千八百八十米长的运输巷道的掘进工程，为我国采掘工业和铁路隧道工程建设更长距离通风开辟了广阔的前景
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”
    陶庄煤矿的通风工人，遵照毛主席的教导，在无产阶级文化大革命中，发扬大无畏的创造精神，用极其普通的小型扇风机和一般规格的胶质风筒，把我国煤矿单巷长距离通风技术推进到世界先进水平的行列。
    这些普通的工人，在普通的物质条件下，创造出很不普通的成就，证明了一个颠扑不破的真理：最聪明，最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。他们一旦用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来，总结和运用自己丰富的实践经验，是什么人间奇迹都能创造出来的。
    这些革命派战士，踢开洋教条，打破旧框框，不靠资产阶级“权威”的“理论”，而靠毛主席的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的伟大思想指导自己的行动。他们每天毫不懈怠地从头至尾反复细致地检查风筒，捕捉从来不被人注意的极为细小的漏风点，千方百计把它消灭掉。他们终于创造出世界上第一条基本上不漏风的风筒。这使帝、修国家的煤矿通风“权威”技术，在他们面前，黯然失色！
    他们的创造，值得庆贺。他们的经验，值得推广。但是，首先要学习的，是他们的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神。
    据新华社济南电　在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，山东枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，冲破了洋框框的束缚，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的重重阻挠，在矿井单巷掘进工程中，用一台十一瓩的普通小型扇风机和一条直径五百毫米的一般规格的胶质风筒，充分供应施工需要的风量，顺利地完成了一条二千八百八十米长的运输巷道的掘进工程，使我国煤矿单巷长距离通风技术跨入了世界先进水平的行列，为我国采掘工业和铁路隧道工程建设更长距离通风开辟了广阔的前景。
    陶庄煤矿无产阶级革命派的这一创举，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是他们在无产阶级文化大革命中认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利。
    陶庄煤矿无产阶级革命派把单巷通风距离一下子提高到二千八百八十米，完成了这条运输巷道的掘进工程，在我国是一个创举，假如巷道距离再长的话，据推算，送风距离可以延长到四千米左右。单巷长距离通风，在某些帝国主义和修正主义国家，虽然也有达到三四千米的，但他们或是用多台扇风机串连，或是用特大型扇风机和大规格风筒送风。而我国陶庄煤矿使用的却是极其普通的十一瓩小型扇风机和一般规格的胶质风筒，平均每瓩送风距离达到二百六十一米，通风效果大大超过了有几十年煤矿通风“理论”的老牌帝国主义国家和苏修。在防止风筒漏风和降低阻力方面，陶庄煤矿无产阶级革命派也用实践粉碎了帝、修煤矿通风“权威”的谬论。苏修煤矿通风“权威”认为，风筒每百米漏风率最低在百分之十左右，而陶庄煤矿的这条风筒，每百米漏风率只有百分之零点三二八，基本上消灭了漏风，风筒的通风阻力也大大下降。所有这些成就，都大长了我国无产阶级革命派的志气，彻底粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派诬蔑我国文化大革命“破坏了生产”的无耻谰言，雄辩地证明了我国的无产阶级文化大革命是社会生产力发展的强大推动力。
    不久前，煤炭工业部组织有关人员对陶庄煤矿创造的这一先进技术，进行了全面鉴定。鉴定结果，风筒进风口的供风量是每分钟八十点六立方米，虽然经过了近六华里的路程，到达掘进工作面的风筒出风口的有效风量，每分钟仍达七十三点二立方米，平均每个掘进工人每分钟的供风量大大超过了国家规定标准。
    陶庄煤矿无产阶级革命派在创造单巷长距离通风过程中，摸索出了一系列新的技术数据，为建立我国自己的煤矿通风理论打下了基础。陶庄煤矿在这项工程中因为少开一条配风巷道，就为国家节省资金数十万元，并且加快了矿井建设速度。这个经验如果在全国煤矿和其他采掘工业、铁路隧道等工程普遍推广，将为国家节省大量的资金、人力和物力，对加速我国基础工业和交通事业的建设具有重大的意义。
    单巷长距离通风二千八百八十米的主要创造者，都是一些普通的通风工人。他们说：没有毛泽东思想，没有无产阶级文化大革命，就没有我们的两千八百八。
    实现单巷长距离通风，最主要的关键是要创造出一条基本上不漏风的风筒。过去，五六百米长的风筒每百米漏风率一般都在百分之十以上，现在，要使长达两千八百八十米的风筒做到基本上不漏风，这是摆在通风工人面前的一项空前艰巨、繁重的任务。但是，工人们坚信：只要用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来！他们活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，象爱护自己的眼睛一样，每天都要把风筒从头至尾反复细细检查，发现、捕捉从来不被人注意的极为细小的漏风点，千方百计把它消灭掉。终于，创造出世界上第一条基本上不漏风的风筒。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的通风工人对革命事业无限忠诚，他们日日夜夜用自己的心血和汗水，用自己的聪明和智慧，为实现单巷长距离通风而艰苦奋斗。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从工程一开始，就处心积虑地加以阻挠。当风筒前进到二千五百米、眼看胜利即将在望时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派竟公然下命令停止前进，妄图把单巷长距离通风掐死。工人们根据毛主席关于“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制”的教导，起来大造了他们的反，进行了针锋相对的斗争，彻底粉碎了他们破坏单巷长距离通风的罪恶阴谋，胜利地完成了任务。（附图片）
