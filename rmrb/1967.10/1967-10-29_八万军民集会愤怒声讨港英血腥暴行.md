80,000 Military and Civilians Rally to Condemn British Brutalities in Hong Kong

The British Authorities Must Carry Out the Serious Demands Made by the Chinese Government in Its Various Notes

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 28th: 80,000 revolutionary masses from various sectors in Guangdong Province held a grand meeting this morning at Yuexiu Mountain Sports Stadium to celebrate the establishment of the Guangdong Province People's Committee to Support Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots in Their Anti-British Struggle. The meeting vehemently denounced the British authorities' large-scale bloody suppression of our patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and expressed the strongest support for the patriots' just struggle against British oppression. The atmosphere of the meeting was filled with a spirit of united resistance against British imperialism. The participants held up huge banners reading: "Firmly support the strongest protest made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country on October 9th to the British government!" "The heinous crimes committed by British imperialism must be thoroughly settled!" "Seven hundred million people of the motherland vow to be the strong backing of the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon!" "The patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon will win! The Chinese people will win! British imperialism will be defeated!"

The meeting began with the solemn and majestic melody of "The East Is Red." Chen Yu, the chairman of the Guangdong Province People's Committee to Support Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots in Their Anti-British Struggle, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said, the Guangdong Province People's Committee to Support Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots in Their Anti-British Struggle has been officially established today. This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The establishment of this committee once again demonstrates the determination of the people of Guangdong Province to be the strong backing of the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and to support their struggle. It will greatly encourage the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon to wage a more magnificent struggle against British oppression and ultimately achieve victory.

Chen Yu, in his speech, listed the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism against our patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon after saying, in the more than five months of struggle against British oppression, the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, under the great encouragement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland and the firm support of the 700 million people of the motherland, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's teachings of daring to struggle and daring to win, and displayed a fearless revolutionary spirit. They have mobilized and organized the masses in a big way, relying on their own strength, with the working class as the main force, and formed a vast revolutionary army. They have launched a head-on struggle against British imperialism with overwhelming momentum, exposing and fighting against the enemy in various effective ways on the streets, in factories and schools, at sea, and in the British "courts" and prisons. They have made the British imperialists panic-stricken and in a state of disarray. The patriots in Hong Kong have done the right thing and done it well. Their struggle has greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and greatly dampened the arrogance of British imperialism.

Chen Yu concluded by saying, our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The lifespan of imperialism will not be long. They have done all sorts of evil, and all the oppressed peoples of the world will not forgive them." British imperialism, despite suffering consecutive defeats under the heavy blows of the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, will not accept their failure and will surely make a final desperate struggle. We are firmly convinced that the working class and patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, with a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely, strengthen their resolve, continuously consolidate and expand the ranks of the struggle against British oppression, press on with the momentum, and achieve a thorough victory in this struggle against British oppression. The people of Guangdong and the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are bound by blood. The persecution of the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon by British imperialism is also a persecution of us. We cannot tolerate it. The 40 million people of Guangdong Province will, together with the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, be the strong backing of the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. We will actively make all preparations and, according to the needs of the struggle against British oppression, provide all support to the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon until final victory is achieved.

Yang Meisheng, a responsible comrade of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, also delivered a speech at the meeting. He, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Guangzhou Military Region, warmly congratulated the establishment of the Guangdong Province People's Committee to Support Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots in Their Anti-British Struggle, expressed the strongest support for the patriots' struggle against British oppression in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and extended the most cordial greetings and the highest combat salute to the heroic workers and patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon who are standing on the front line of the struggle against British oppression!

Yang Meisheng said, all officers and soldiers of the Guangzhou Military Region will, together with the people of the whole country and the whole province, be the strong backing of the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The great Chinese people are not to be trifled with. The British fascist authorities must sincerely carry out the serious demands made by the Chinese government in its various notes. If they insist on their own way and continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, they will surely not escape the severe punishment of the Chinese people. Old grudges and new enmities must be avenged, and old accounts and new debts must be thoroughly settled.

Chen De, a responsible comrade of the Guangdong Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, also delivered a speech at the meeting.

Following this, representatives of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, students, and cadres from various departments delivered speeches at the meeting. They unanimously condemned the heinous crimes committed by British imperialism, which, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese government and people, continued to brutally persecute and suppress our patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They unanimously expressed their determination to support the patriots' just struggle against British oppression with all their might until final victory is achieved. They pointed out that British imperialism, like all imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, is terrified and hates the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of our country to the core. They are trying every means to suppress and block the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and to obstruct the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon from learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The heinous crimes committed by British imperialism against the Chinese people and the blood debts it owes will surely be thoroughly settled. The worker representative in his speech also pointed out that the working class of Guangdong Province and the patriots in Hong Kong have always had a glorious tradition of jointly opposing British imperialism. We firmly support their just struggle. We will provide whatever they need. We will not rest until we achieve complete victory. We reaffirm: Hong Kong and Kowloon are Chinese territory, and the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are our flesh and blood. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. If British imperialism dares to be enemies of the Chinese people to the end, it will surely meet a bad end.

The meeting ended with the most enthusiastic applause and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The meeting unanimously adopted a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The meeting also unanimously adopted a telegram of greetings to the patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon on the front line of the struggle against British oppression and read out a letter to the people of the entire province.

After the meeting, a grand demonstration march was held.

    八万军民集会愤怒声讨港英血腥暴行
    港英法西斯当局对我国政府历次照会提出的严正要求，必须切实照办
    据新华社广州二十八日电　广东省各界革命群众八万人，今天上午在越秀山体育场隆重举行广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会成立大会。大会愤怒声讨港英当局大规模血腥镇压我港九爱国同胞的法西斯罪行，最坚决支持港九爱国同胞反英抗暴正义斗争。大会充满对英帝国主义同仇敌忾的气氛。参加大会的群众高举的巨幅标语上写着：“坚决拥护我国外交部十月九日向英国政府提出最强烈抗议！”“英帝国主义犯下的滔天罪行必须彻底清算！”“七亿祖国人民誓作港九爱国同胞的坚强后盾！”“港九同胞必胜！中国人民必胜！英帝必败！”
    大会在庄严雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会主任陈郁在大会上讲话。他说，广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会今天正式成立了。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这个委员会的成立，再一次显示了我们广东省人民誓作港九爱国同胞的坚强后盾，和支持港九爱国同胞斗争的最大决心，它将大大鼓舞港九爱国同胞开展更加波澜壮阔的反英抗暴斗争，直至取得最后胜利。
    陈郁在讲话中列举英帝国主义对我港九爱国同胞进行最残酷的压榨，犯下的滔天罪行以后说，在五个多月的反英抗暴斗争中，港九爱国同胞在祖国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大鼓舞下，在祖国七亿人民的坚决支援下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵照毛主席敢于斗争，敢于胜利的教导，发扬大无畏的革命造反精神，大张旗鼓地动员群众，组织群众，依靠自己的力量，以工人阶级为主力军，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，以摧枯拉朽之势，对港英帝国主义展开了针锋相对的大揭露，大斗争。他们意气风发，斗志昂扬，在街头，在工厂、学校，在海上，在港英的“法庭”和牢狱里，以各种有效的方式，对敌人进行了无情的揭露，狠狠的打击，使港英帝国主义焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。香港爱国同胞干得对，干得好，他们的斗争大长了中国人民的志气，大灭了英帝国主义的威风。
    陈郁最后说，我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”港英帝国主义在港九爱国同胞的狠狠打击下，虽然已经连续遭到惨败，但是它决不会甘心自己的失败，必然要作最后的垂死挣扎。我们坚信，有着光荣反帝斗争传统的港九工人阶级和爱国同胞，必定会进一步更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧密团结，增强斗志，不断地巩固和壮大反英抗暴斗争的队伍，再接再厉，乘胜前进，取得这场反英抗暴斗争的彻底胜利。广东人民和港九同胞血肉相连，港英帝国主义对港九爱国同胞的迫害，也就是对我们的迫害，我们绝不能容忍，广东省四千万人民一定和全国人民一道，在毛主席和党中央的英明领导下，誓作港九爱国同胞的坚强后盾。我们将积极做好一切准备，根据反英抗暴斗争的形势需要，给予港九爱国同胞以一切支援，直到取得最后胜利。
    中国人民解放军广州部队负责人杨梅生在大会上讲话。他代表广州部队全体指战员热烈祝贺广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会的成立，表示最坚决地支持港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争，并向英勇地站在反英抗暴斗争前线的港九工人阶级和爱国同胞致以最亲切的慰问、最崇高的战斗敬礼！
    杨梅生说，我们广州部队全体指战员，坚决同全国、全省人民一道，誓作港九爱国同胞的坚强后盾。伟大的中国人民是不好惹的。港英法西斯当局必须老老实实按照我国政府历次照会提出的严正要求，切实照办。如若一意孤行，继续与中国人民为敌，必将逃不脱中国人民的严厉惩罚。旧恨新仇，一定要报，老账新账，一定要彻底清算。
    中国人民解放军广东省军区负责人陈德也在大会上讲了话。
    接着，工人、贫下中农、学生、机关干部代表分别在大会上讲话。他们一致愤怒谴责港英帝国主义不顾我国政府和我国人民的多次警告，不断地对我港九爱国同胞进行残酷迫害和血腥镇压所犯下的滔天罪行。他们一致表示，决心以最大的力量支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴的正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利。他们指出，港英帝国主义和一切帝国主义、修正主义、反动派一样，对我国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死，恨得要命。它们千方百计地企图压制和封锁我国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，阻挠港九爱国同胞学习和宣传毛泽东思想。港英帝国主义对中国人民所犯下的滔天罪行和欠下的累累血债，我们是一定要彻底清算的。工人代表在讲话中还特别指出，我们广东省工人阶级和香港爱国同胞历来就有共同反对英帝国主义的光荣传统。我们坚决支持他们的正义斗争，要什么有什么，不获全胜，决不罢休。我们重申：香港和九龙是中国的领土，港九同胞是中国人民的亲骨肉。中国人民不是好惹的，英帝国主义如果胆敢与中国人民为敌到底，决没有好下场。
    大会在最热烈的掌声和“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声中，一致通过向毛主席的致敬电。大会还一致通过致反英抗暴斗争前线的港九爱国同胞的慰问电，并宣读了告全省人民书。
    大会结束后，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
