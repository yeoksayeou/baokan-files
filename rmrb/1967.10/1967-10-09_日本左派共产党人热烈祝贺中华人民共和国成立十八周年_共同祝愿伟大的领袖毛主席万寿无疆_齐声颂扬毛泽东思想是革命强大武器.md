In the days leading up to the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese personnel stationed in Japan received a flurry of congratulatory telegrams and letters from various parts of Japan, including Hokkaido, Northern Kyushu, Nagasaki, Shikoku, Hokuriku, and Tokai.

"Long live the great leader of all the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of all the people of the world, ten thousand times long live!" "We wish Chairman Mao a long life, ten thousand years of life!" These were the common wishes expressed in the telegrams and letters from Japanese friends.

The Fukoka Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist faction) stated in their telegram that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has opened up a new era in human history; it has ignited the fervent revolutionary flames of the oppressed peoples and nations, and has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, reactionaries of various countries, and the revisionist clique led by Komoto.

The telegram said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has given us true communists the most powerful weapon, Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory."

The telegram continued, "On this day of celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we raise high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible in a hundred battles, and cheer for the struggle against the U.S. military base in Banzu and for the anti-revisionist struggle of the workers at the Yawata Steel Works. ... We will celebrate the 18th anniversary of the great People's Republic of China with actual struggles."

The Aichi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist faction) wrote in their letter, "At present, the strengthening of unity between the peoples of Japan and China and the struggle for genuine Japan-China friendship are rapidly developing nationwide. This is a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and their running dogs, the Japan Communist Party revisionists."

"We, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are now strengthening our ranks and are determined to carry the Japanese revolution through to the end."

The Preparatory Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) in Hokkaido sent a telegram from Sapporo congratulating the 18th anniversary of the great People's Republic of China, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and sincerely wishing the most beloved Chairman Mao of all revolutionary people of the world a long life.

    日本左派共产党人热烈祝贺中华人民共和国成立十八周年
    共同祝愿伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆  齐声颂扬毛泽东思想是革命强大武器
    据新华社东京五日电　在中华人民共和国成立十八周年前夕，中国驻日人员收到从日本的北海道、北九州、长崎、四国、北陆、东海等各地发来的雪片般的贺电贺信。
      “全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”这是日本朋友在贺电、贺信中表达的共同祝愿。
    日本共产党福冈县委员会（左派）在贺电中说，毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，开辟了人类历史上从来未有的新天地；燃起了被压迫人民和被压迫民族旺盛的革命火焰，给予了美帝、苏修、各国反动派和宫本修正主义集团以沉重的打击。
    电报说，中国无产阶级文化大革命给予我们真正的共产主义者以毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。
    电报说：“在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的日子里，我们高举百战百胜的毛泽东思想的旗帜，为（反对美军）板付基地的斗争、为八幡制钢厂工人的反修斗争而欢呼。……我们将用实际斗争来庆祝伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年。”
    日本共产党爱知县委员会（左派）在贺信中写道：“目前，加强日中两国人民的团结、争取真正日中友好的日中友好组织正在全国迅速发展，这是对美日反动派及其走狗日共修正主义分子的沉重打击。
    “我们在毛泽东思想指引下，现在正在加强自己的队伍，决心把日本革命进行到底。”
    日中友好协会（正统）北海道总部筹备会发自札幌的贺电，祝贺伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年，祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，衷心敬祝全世界革命人民最敬爱的毛主席万寿无疆。
