Correctly handling cadre issues is a key problem in achieving the three-in-one combination of revolution, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. It is an important link in continuing to advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The cadre issue must be addressed through education, expanding the scope of education.

We must unite and educate the majority of cadres. For cadres who have made mistakes, including those who have made serious mistakes, as long as they are not stubborn and unrepentant, we must unite and educate them. This is Chairman Mao's consistent thought, our Party's consistent revolutionary tradition, and the only correct Marxist-Leninist policy.

The rectification movement led by Chairman Mao in 1942 in Yan'an is our Party's most valuable historical experience in handling cadre issues. This rectification movement mobilized the vast majority of Party cadres to thoroughly criticize the erroneous lines in our Party's history, adopting a new method: starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, clarifying right and wrong, and achieving new unity on a new basis. This educated the vast majority of cadres, united the entire Party, and ensured the great victory of the people's revolutionary war. This is Chairman Mao's major contribution to the Marxist-Leninist principles of party building. In the new historical period of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must definitely maintain and carry forward this fine tradition cultivated by Chairman Mao. This is an important guarantee for the victory of our revolutionary cause.

Our cadres are always advancing by arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and overcoming various shortcomings and mistakes. We must allow cadres to correct their mistakes. Some comrades who have made mistakes may not understand immediately and should be given more time to think. We must allow them to have fluctuations in their thoughts; they may understand for a while, but when they encounter something, they may not understand again, and we can wait. Making mistakes and correcting them is good. "Mistakes are often the forerunners of correctness." Through education, accepting lessons, raising awareness, and resolutely correcting mistakes, cadres who have made mistakes can still become good cadres.

Many of our cadres have come through the democratic revolution, but they are not well prepared in terms of ideology, theory, and experience for the socialist revolution, especially the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, re-educating cadres and properly solving the problem of their worldview has become a universal and strategically significant major task. Not only cadres who have made mistakes need education, but also those who have not made mistakes. Old cadres need education, and new cadres also need education. This is a matter that concerns the fate and future of our country.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally speaking, is a revolutionary movement to educate the vast number of cadres and the masses to oppose and prevent revisionism. To ensure that the proletarian dictatorship will never change color, we must overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and at the same time, educate the majority of cadres. In a certain sense, overthrowing the handful is precisely for the purpose of uniting and educating the majority; only by uniting and educating the majority can we truly overthrow the handful.

The line of the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is to "strike a large number and protect a small number," which is "left" in form but right in essence, "doubt everything, overthrow everything." This is a line to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry out a capitalist restoration. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is to unite and educate the majority of cadres and strike the handful. This is the line that ensures the prosperity of our revolutionary cause and the fundamental interests of the broad masses.

All proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses must, with "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, handle the cadre issue from the fundamental interests of the revolution, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, thoroughly sweep away the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and the "left" in form but right in essence thought on cadre issues, adopt the method of class analysis for cadres, strictly distinguish between two kinds of different contradictions and two kinds of power-holders, and firmly unite and fight with the broad revolutionary cadres to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　从教育着手解决干部问题
    正确地对待干部，是实现革命的三结合，巩固革命的大联合，搞好本单位斗批改的关键问题，是把无产阶级文化大革命继续推向前进的一个重要环节。
    毛主席教导我们：干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面。
    团结教育干部的大多数，对于犯了错误的干部，包括犯了严重错误的干部，只要不是坚持不改，累教不改的，都要团结教育他们。这是毛主席一贯的思想，是我们党的一贯的革命传统，是唯一正确的马克思列宁主义的方针。
    毛主席亲自领导的一九四二年延安整风，是我们党对待干部问题的最宝贵的历史经验。这次整风，发动全党广大干部，对我们党历史上的错误路线作了彻底的批判，采取了一个新方法，就是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，分清是非，在新的基础上达到新的团结。这就教育了广大干部，团结了全党，保证了人民革命战争的伟大胜利。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义建党原则的一个重大贡献。我们在无产阶级专政条件下革命的新的历史时期，一定要保持和发扬毛主席所培养起来的这个优良传统。这是我们革命事业取得胜利的一个重要保证。
    我们的干部总是在用毛泽东思想武装自己、克服这样那样的缺点错误中前进的。我们要允许干部改正错误。有一些犯错误的同志一时想不通，还应该给他们时间，让他们多想一个时候。要允许他们思想有反复，一时想通了，遇到一些事又想不通，还可以等待。犯错误，改了就好。“错误常常是正确的先导”。通过教育，接受了经验教训，提高了觉悟，坚决改正错误，犯过错误的干部还可能成为好干部。
    我们的许多干部，是从民主革命中走过来的，但是，对社会主义革命，特别是对无产阶级专政条件下的革命，在思想上、理论上、经验上都准备不足，因此或多或少地跟不上革命形势发展的要求。这样，重新教育干部，好好解决干部中的世界观问题，就成为一项普遍的具有战略意义的重大任务。不但犯错误的干部需要教育，没有犯错误的干部同样需要教育。老干部需要教育，新干部也需要教育。这是关系到我们国家命运和前途的大事。
    无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上说，就是一场教育广大干部和广大群众反修、防修的革命运动。我们要保证无产阶级的政权永不变色，就要打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，同时，又要教育干部的大多数。在一定意义上，打倒一小撮，正是为了团结教育大多数；也只有团结教育了大多数，才能真正打倒一小撮。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行的资产阶级反动路线，是“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是形“左”实右的“怀疑一切，打倒一切”。这是一条颠覆无产阶级专政、实行资本主义复辟的路线。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是要团结和教育干部的大多数，打击一小撮。这是保证我们革命事业兴旺的路线，是广大人民根本利益的所在。
    一切无产阶级革命派和革命群众，必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，从革命的根本利益出发对待干部问题，坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策，彻底肃清干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线和形“左”实右的思想影响，对干部采取阶级分析的方法，严格区分两种不同性质的矛盾和两种当权派，坚定不移地同广大革命干部团结战斗在一起，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。　（十月二十日）
