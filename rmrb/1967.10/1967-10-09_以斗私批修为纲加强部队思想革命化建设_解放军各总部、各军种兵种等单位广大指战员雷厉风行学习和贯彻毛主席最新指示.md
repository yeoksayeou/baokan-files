The broad masses of cadres and fighters in the various general departments, military branches, and armed forces of the People's Liberation Army of China, upon hearing Lin Biao's report on the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" during the National Day address, immediately sprang into action, swiftly and resolutely launching extensive and in-depth study activities. They promptly and decisively implemented Chairman Mao's latest great battle call into action.

Upon hearing the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive, the various leading organs immediately convened meetings of the standing committee of the Party Committee, first of all to seriously study and then to research and deploy the implementation plan for carrying out Chairman Mao's latest directive. The General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, National Defense Science Commission, National Defense Industrial Office, Air Force, Navy, Second Artillery, Armored Forces, Engineering Corps, Communications Corps, Chemical Defense Corps, Artillery Corps, and Beijing Military Region Party Committees all made decisions to use "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link to strengthen the thought revolutionization of the troops. They issued notices or made oral deployments to thoroughly study and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest directive. They demanded that all subordinate organs, troops, and academies immediately take action to make the thorough study and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directive on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" the top political priority and the overriding central task. They immediately launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they vowed to perform new meritorious deeds for the people. The various organ Party Committees also demanded that leaders at all levels take the lead in studying, take the lead in implementing, and take the lead in vigorously transforming their world outlook. They should engage in thorough criticism and self-criticism, become vanguards in the struggle against selfishness, and pioneers in criticizing revisionism, setting a good example for the troops. The Beijing Military Region Party Committee, during an expanded meeting, also invited leading cadres from various units engaged in the "three supports, two militaries" on the front lines in the North China region to participate, focusing on the immediate establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and further improving military-civilian relations and superior-subordinate relations.

In recent days, many units have held "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" mobilization meetings from top to bottom. At the "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" meeting held by the Navy's "Red Revolutionary Headquarters" on the 6th, Navy Political Commissar Li Zuopeng and other leading comrades attended the meeting. Everyone, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, made a vow: they would definitely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and while transforming the objective world, with a sense of urgency, carry out a thorough revolution in the depths of their souls, fiercely struggle against the "selfish" character, thoroughly transform their world outlook, and become steadfast proletarian revolutionary fighters who are selfless and dedicated to the public. The leading organs of the Engineering Corps and Armored Forces also held mobilization meetings on the 6th. Engineering Corps leaders Chen Shigang and Tan Fureng attended the meeting and spoke at the meeting. Many cadres and fighters emphasized in their speeches that Lin Biao's important directive that "only by thoroughly struggling against the 'selfish' character can the struggle against revisionism be carried out to the end" is a great truth. They said, the "selfish" character is the core of the bourgeois world outlook and the ideological source of revisionism. Only by overthrowing the "selfish" character can the root of revisionism be eliminated. They must, with a sense of urgency and revolutionary spirit of seeing blood, struggle against the "selfish" character and build an iron wall in their minds that cannot be breached by revisionism.

Now, the various general departments, military branches, and armed forces leading organs of the PLA, as well as the Beijing Military Region leading organs, have launched a high tide of deeply studying Chairman Mao's latest directive on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." From the organs to the companies to the grassroots units, countless study discussion meetings, symposiums, and experience-sharing meetings are held every day and night. The leading comrades of the Air Force organ start their day by studying the first quotation from Chairman Mao: to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. They guide their work and study with the four characters "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the General Logistics Department have already, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, launched a rectification campaign and consciously carried out a revolution. The entire cadre and fighter contingent of the Second Artillery leading organ, while studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, examined their own thoughts, launching a fierce struggle to seize the "selfish" character in their minds. Everyone voluntarily exposed their thoughts, dug out the roots, touched their souls, discussed the harm, summarized experiences and lessons, and carried out self-criticism. The leading cadres and proletarian revolutionary cadres of the National Defense Science Commission, during their study, especially linked the specific practices of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and their own active thoughts for examination. Some leading cadres said, struggling against selfishness is a lifelong task for proletarian revolutionary fighters. They must constantly transform their world outlook, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and perform new meritorious deeds for the people. According to Lin Biao's directive to establish various study classes, the Beijing Military Region decided that all subordinate troops' division-level and above leading organs would simultaneously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, train all cadres in batches, and assist local areas in training cadres and Red Guards. They have already established a Mao Zedong Thought study class leadership group led by comrades such as Zheng Weishan and Chen Xianrui.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest ideological weapon for "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism." While seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive, the broad masses of cadres and fighters have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They, with deep hatred for the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, seeking guidance and reporting to Chairman Mao's works before, during, and after the criticism. They, with various problems in the Cultural Revolution and their own active thoughts, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the "Three Articles" as their weapon, thoroughly broke the "selfish" character, and let the "public" character guide everything. Everyone vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the great struggle of "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in their minds, and turn the entire army and the country into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

The cadres and fighters of a certain company of the 4622nd Unit, in response to the great commander Chairman Mao's latest battle call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," vowed to thoroughly break the "selfish" character, firmly establish the "public" character, become vanguards in the struggle against selfishness, and pioneers in criticizing revisionism.

    以斗私批修为纲加强部队思想革命化建设
    解放军各总部、各军种兵种等单位广大指战员雷厉风行学习和贯彻毛主席最新指示
    新华社八日讯　中国人民解放军各总部、国防科委、国防工办、海军、空军，以及各兵种和北京部队领导机关广大指战员，听到林副主席在国庆讲话中传达毛主席关于“斗私，批修”的伟大指示后，立即闻风而动，雷厉风行展开广泛深入的学习活动，并且最迅速、最坚决地把毛主席这一最新的伟大战斗号召落实于行动。
    各领导机关在听到了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示后，立即召开党委常委会议，首先认真学习，并研究部署了贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的落实计划。总参谋部、总后勤部、国防科委、国防工办、空军、海军、第二炮兵、装甲兵、工程兵、通信兵、防化学兵、炮兵以及北京部队等党委，都作出了以“斗私，批修”为纲，加强部队思想革命化建设的决定，下达了关于认真学习、坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示的通知或口头部署。要求所属机关、部队、院校立即行动起来，把组织全体指战员认真学习、坚决贯彻毛主席关于“斗私，批修”的最新指示，作为当前最大的政治，作为压倒一切的中心任务，立即掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作，“斗私，批修”的新高潮，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中为人民立新功，各机关党委还要求各级负责同志要带头学习，带头贯彻，带头狠抓世界观的改造，搞好革命大批判，做斗私的尖兵，批修的闯将，给部队作出好样子。北京部队党委在召开扩大会议时，还吸收战斗在华北地区“三支”“两军”第一线上的各部队领导干部参加，着重研究了立即开办毛泽东思想学习班，进一步搞好军民关系、上下级关系等问题。
    连日来，许多单位从上到下都召开了“斗私，批修”誓师大会。在海直“红联总”六日召开的“斗私，批修”大会上，海军政委李作鹏等领导同志参加了大会。大家满怀革命豪情发出誓言：一定紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，在改造客观世界的同时，以只争朝夕的精神，在灵魂深处大闹革命，狠斗“私”字，彻底改造世界观，做一个一心为公、一切为公的坚强的无产阶级革命战士。工程兵、装甲兵领导机关无产阶级革命派六日也分别举行了誓师大会。工程兵负责同志陈士榘、谭甫仁，参加了大会，并在会上讲了话。许多指战员在讲话中强调指出，林副主席关于“只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底”的重要指示，是一个伟大的真理。他们说，“私”字是资产阶级世界观的核心，是产生修正主义的思想根源。只有打倒“私”字，才能铲除产生修正主义的根子。我们一定要以只争朝夕和刺刀见红的革命精神，斗掉“私”字，在自己的头脑里筑起一道攻不破的反修防修的钢铁长城。
    现在，解放军各总部、各军种、兵种领导机关和北京部队领导机关，已经出现了深入学习毛主席“斗私，批修”最新指示的热潮。从机关到连队到基层单位，每天每晚都有数不清的学习讨论会、座谈会、讲用会在举行。空军领导机关的同志，每天早晨学的第一条毛主席语录就是要斗私，批修。他们天天以“斗私，批修”四个字为纲，统帅工作和学习。总后勤部的无产阶级革命派，有的已经以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，展开了整风，自觉革命。第二炮兵领导机关全体指战员，边学习毛主席最新指示边对照自己思想，展开了一个狠夺头脑中“私”字的权的斗争。大家主动亮思想，挖根子，触灵魂，谈危害，总结经验教训，进行自我批评。国防科委的领导干部和无产阶级革命派在学习中，特别联系一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的具体实践和自己的活思想进行了检查。有的领导干部说，斗私是无产阶级革命战士毕生的任务，我们一定要不断改造自己的世界观，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为人民立新功。北京部队根据林副主席要开办各种学习班的指示，决定所属部队师以上领导机关同时开办毛泽东思想学习班，分期分批训练全体干部，并协助地方训练干部和红卫兵。他们已经成立了由郑维山、陈先瑞等负责同志参加的毛泽东思想学习班领导小组。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是“斗私，批修”最锐利的思想武器。广大指战员在认真学习、坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示的时候，都进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。他们带着对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的深仇大恨，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，批判前、批判中和批判后，都坚持向毛主席著作请示汇报。他们带着文化大革命中的各种问题和自己头脑中的活思想，活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为武器，大破“私”字，让“公”字统帅一切。大家决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“斗私，批修”的伟大斗争中，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想在头脑中深深扎根，把全军全国都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。（附图片）
