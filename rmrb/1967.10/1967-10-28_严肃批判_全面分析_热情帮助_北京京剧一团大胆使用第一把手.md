Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This must be resolved.

	Serious Criticism, Comprehensive Analysis, and Warm Assistance

	Beijing Peking Opera Troupe Boldly Uses the First-in-Charge

	The revolutionary masses of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, daring to liberate a large number of cadres, boldly use the first-in-charge, and actively pay attention to the role of revolutionary cadres.

	Comprehensive Analysis of the Cadre Team

	In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party sent a work team to the Peking Opera Troupe and the "cultural revolution" they concocted. In the cadre issue, they stubbornly implemented the reactionary bourgeois line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number," seriously disrupting the class line of the troupe.

	The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Peking Opera Troupe, represented by the "Sha Jiachuan Revolutionary Combat Team," resolutely resisted this reactionary bourgeois line. At the same time, they seriously fought against the anarchist thoughts of "overthrowing everything" and "suspecting everything." They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's cadre policy and seriously understood Chairman Mao's teachings on "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres." On November 28 of last year, Comrade Jiang Qing, in her speech at the literary and artistic circle meeting, comprehensively expounded on Chairman Mao's cadre policy in light of the situation in the Peking Opera Troupe. Comrade Jiang Qing said: "In your troupe, not all cadres, party members, and league members have made mistakes, nor have all cadres made the same kind of mistakes. They must be treated differently, facts must be presented, and reasons must be given. The attitude of 'punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the person' should be adopted, allowing for the correction of mistakes and allowing for revolution." The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Peking Opera Troupe, based on Comrade Jiang Qing's speech, analyzed the situation of the cadre team. The first type is basically standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They dared to take the lead in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fearlessly facing attacks, and fought side by side with the revolutionary masses against the reactionary bourgeois line. Such cadres are in the majority in the Peking Opera Troupe. The second type is those who do not understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are afraid to take the lead, and waver in the middle, not daring to stand out. The third type is the handful who stubbornly resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They spread rumors, stir up trouble, and incite the masses to fight each other, attempting to seize the leadership of the Peking Opera Troupe.

	Using the Small Rectification Method to Liberate Cadres

	How to liberate cadres? There are two different approaches: one is for everyone to pass through; the other is to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," using the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," and through the cadres' self-awareness of revolution, liberating a large number of cadres. The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Peking Opera Troupe, with the help of the army, adopted the latter approach, organizing more than twenty middle-level cadres, using the small rectification method, studying Chairman Mao's works, and conducting criticism and self-criticism. After some cadres who made serious and general mistakes made serious self-examinations, they participated in the revolutionary big criticism with the masses, actively exposing problems, and educating themselves. With the help and understanding of the revolutionary masses, a large number of cadres in the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe stood up and participated in appropriate work.

	Correctly Handling the "First-in-Charge"

	How should cadres who have made serious mistakes, especially the first-in-charge, be handled? Chairman Mao said: "As long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, they should be allowed to change and encouraged to redeem themselves with meritorious service." The first-in-charge of this troupe, former party branch secretary and director, Xue Enpu, had implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, committing serious mistakes. The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Peking Opera Troupe, in accordance with Chairman Mao's traditional policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the person," first focused on criticizing such cadres. Because only "punishing past mistakes" can "prevent future ones," and "curing the sickness" is for "saving the person." They, together with the revolutionary masses, conducted an in-depth exposure and criticism of Xue Enpu, while giving him the opportunity and time to examine and correct his mistakes, allowing him to be tempered and tested in the revolutionary big criticism, change his stance, and raise his awareness. Through the mass criticism struggle, Xue Enpu thoroughly exposed the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, drew a clear line with the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, former Propaganda Department, and former Ministry of Culture, and deeply touched his soul. Xue Enpu expressed his determination to "wash his heart and become a new person" with actual actions. The proletarian revolutionary masses, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on "not only looking at a cadre's one-time or one-event, but also looking at a cadre's entire history and entire work," conducted a comprehensive investigation of Xue Enpu's history. Xue Enpu, since joining the revolution, had not made any serious mistakes. During the various political movements and the three years of difficulty, his performance was relatively good. During the Cultural Revolution, he took a sincere and honest attitude towards the masses' repeated criticisms, not harboring any resistance. Based on a comprehensive analysis and investigation of Xue Enpu, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, after multiple discussions, boldly liberated him. Finally, they unanimously agreed to absorb Xue Enpu into the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe. Xue Enpu was deeply moved and said: "Chairman Mao saved me, and the proletarian revolutionary masses saved me."

	Boldly Using and Warmly Assisting Revolutionary Cadres

	In the past few months of struggle practice, the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Peking Opera Troupe deeply felt that to truly liberate cadres, they must boldly use revolutionary cadres, warmly assist them in class struggle and work, support them, temper them, and this is an important part of fully implementing Chairman Mao's cadre line. When Xue Enpu started working, he was afraid of saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing and dared not take responsibility. The comrades of the army and the revolutionary masses of the troupe consciously pushed him to the front line of class struggle, letting him face the wind and rain, actively participate in the revolutionary big criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. In the struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen in the capital's literary and artistic circles and in the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the unit, Xue Enpu bravely conducted face-to-face exposure and struggle.

	Now, Xue Enpu is in charge of the troupe's business leadership. In the struggle to promote production, in the troupe's rush to rehearse revolutionary model operas such as "Sha Jiachuan," "Capturing the Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Harbor," he has played a role.

	Under the bright guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with the warm assistance of the comrades of the army and the proletarian revolutionary masses, Xue Enpu, after rejoining the ranks of the proletarian revolution, seriously took "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as his motto, continuously promoting his thought revolutionization. He, as an ordinary laborer, grasps the revolution and promotes production, pays attention to improving the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and blends in with the masses. He often rehearses with the actors until late at night and helps the stage crew with setting up and taking down the stage. He is determined to respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's latest battle call of "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," to earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously reform his worldview, and strive to make new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 严肃批判　全面分析　热情帮助  北京京剧一团大胆使用第一把手

    正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。					毛泽东
    严肃批判　全面分析　热情帮助
    北京京剧一团大胆使用第一把手
    本报讯　北京京剧一团的无产阶级革命派，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，敢于解放干部的“一大片”，大胆使用第一把手，积极注意发挥革命干部的作用。
          全面分析干部队伍
    无产阶级文化大革命的初期，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派派到京剧一团的工作队和由他们炮制的“文革”，在干部问题上顽固地执行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，严重地搅乱了剧团的阶级阵线。
    京剧一团以“沙家浜革命战斗兵团”为代表的无产阶级革命派，坚决抵制了这条资产阶级反动路线，同时跟“打倒一切”、“怀疑一切”的无政府主义思想进行了严肃的斗争。他们反复学习了毛主席的干部政策，认真地领会毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导。去年十一月二十八日，江青同志在文艺界大会上的讲话中，针对京剧一团的情况，全面地阐述了毛主席的干部政策。江青同志说：“你们剧团内，并不是所有干部、党员、团员都犯了错误，也不是所有干部都犯同样性质的错误，而是必须区别对待，摆事实，讲道理，采取‘惩前毖后，治病救人’的态度，允许改正错误，允许革命。”京剧一团的无产阶级革命派，根据江青同志的讲话，分析了干部队伍的情况。第一种是基本上站在毛主席的革命路线方面的。他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，敢字当头，不怕围攻，和革命派并肩战斗，对资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争。这样的干部在京剧一团占多数。第二种是对毛主席的革命路线很不理解，怕字当头，中间摇摆，不敢站出来。第三种是顽固抵制毛主席革命路线的“一小撮”。他们煽阴风、点鬼火，挑动群众斗群众，妄图夺取京剧一团的领导权。
      采取小整风办法解放干部
    怎样解放干部呢？有两种不同的作法：一种是人人过关；一种是遵照毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，通过干部的自觉革命，解放干部的一大片。京剧一团的无产阶级革命派，在解放军的帮助下，采取了后一种作法，把二十多个中层干部组织起来，采取小整风的办法，学习毛主席著作，进行批评和自我批评。部分犯了较严重错误和一般错误的干部作了认真的检查以后，又和群众一起参加革命的大批判，积极揭发问题，自己教育自己。在得到革命群众的帮助和谅解下，北京京剧一团的大批干部都站了出来，参加适当的工作。
        正确对待“第一把手”
    应当怎样对待犯了严重错误的干部，特别是第一把手呢？毛主席说：“只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。”这个剧团的第一把手、前党总支书记兼团长薛恩厚，曾经执行了旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，犯了严重的错误。京剧一团的无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的传统政策，对薛恩厚这样的干部首先立足于批判。因为只有“惩前”，才能“毖后”，而“治病”是为了“救人”。他们和革命群众一起，对薛恩厚进行了深入的揭发和批判，同时给以检查错误、改正错误的机会和时间，让他在革命的大批判中经受锻炼，接受考验，转变立场，提高觉悟。经过群众性的批判斗争，促使薛恩厚彻底揭发了旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团的滔天罪行，与旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部的修正主义路线划清了界限，并且狠触了自己灵魂。薛恩厚表示决心用实际行动“洗心革面，重新作人”。无产阶级革命派又遵照毛主席关于“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，对薛恩厚的历史进行了全面考查。薛恩厚参加革命以来，没有犯过严重错误，在历次政治运动和三年困难时期，表现都较好。在文化大革命中，他对群众的多次批判，采取了诚恳老实的态度，不是抱着抵触情绪。根据对薛恩厚的全面分析和考查，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，经过多次讨论，大胆地解放了他。最后，一致同意吸收薛恩厚参加北京京剧一团革命委员会。薛恩厚十分感动地说：“毛主席挽救了我，无产阶级革命派挽救了我。”
    大胆使用、热情帮助革命干部
    几个月来的斗争实践，京剧一团的无产阶级革命派深深体会到：要真正解放干部，还要大胆使用革命干部，在阶级斗争和工作中热情帮助他们，支持他们，锻炼他们，这是全面贯彻执行毛主席干部路线的一个重要组成部分。薛恩厚开始工作时，生怕说错了话，做错了事，不敢大胆负责。解放军同志和剧团的革命群众便有意识地把他推到阶级斗争的第一线去，让他经风雨，见世面，积极参加革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。在首都文艺界斗争反革命修正主义分子彭真的大会上，在斗争本单位的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派时，薛恩厚都勇敢地进行面对面的揭发和斗争。
    现在，薛恩厚负责剧团的业务领导。他在抓革命、促生产中，在剧团赶排《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》和《海港》等革命样板戏的工作中，都发挥了作用。
    在毛主席的革命路线的光辉照耀下，在解放军同志和无产阶级革命派的热情帮助下，薛恩厚重新跟上无产阶级的革命队伍以后，认真地以“老三篇”为座右铭，不断促进自己的思想革命化。他以普通劳动者身份抓革命促生产，注意改善上下级关系，和群众打成一片。他经常和演员一起排戏到深夜，和舞台工作队同志一起装台卸台。他决心响应伟大领袖毛主席“斗私，批修”的最新战斗号令，努力活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造自己的世界观，争取在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
