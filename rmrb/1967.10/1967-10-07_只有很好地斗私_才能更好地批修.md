Revolutionary cadres from Beijing and Shanghai earnestly study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions

Only by waging a struggle against selfishness can we better criticize revisionism. We must specially study Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles," and make the spirit of "complete" and "thorough" service to the people the guiding principle for all our actions. In the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, we must achieve new victories.

According to Xinhua News Agency, after hearing Vice Chairman Lin Biao convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" in his National Day speech, the responsible comrades from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Higher Education Red Guards, and Middle School Red Guards immediately conducted in-depth studies and repeatedly pondered the profound strategic significance of these instructions. In discussing their study experiences, they unanimously agreed that "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" is the latest battle cry issued by our great leader Chairman Mao, a major strategic measure of far-reaching significance in the new situation of the victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a guiding light for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The responsible comrades from the Beijing Workers' Congress said, we workers listen most to Chairman Mao's words. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," launch a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry out a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism. We must further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," seize the revolution, and promote production. We must let Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in our minds and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in every factory and enterprise in the capital. The responsible comrades from the Middle School Red Guards said, our great leader Chairman Mao has great hopes for us young people. We must not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's care and expectations. We must be the vanguards and pioneers of the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, specially study Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles," and make the spirit of "complete" and "thorough" service to the people the guiding principle for all our actions.

They all emphasized in their studies that criticizing revisionism must involve struggling against selfishness, and struggling against selfishness must be combined with criticizing revisionism. They said, the "self" is the core of the bourgeois worldview and the natural soil for the survival and development of revisionism. Only by struggling against the "self" can we thoroughly criticize and overthrow revisionism and uproot its roots. At the same time, only in the struggle against revisionism and in the criticism of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, represented by China's Khrushchev, can we constantly wage a tenacious struggle against the "self" in our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible comrades from the Higher Education Red Guards discussed their experiences in this regard, saying that without a good struggle against "self," the proletarian revolutionary cadres cannot well complete the glorious and arduous tasks of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units.

The responsible comrades from the Higher Education Red Guards also talked about the necessity for intellectuals to learn from workers and peasants and unite with them.

The Beijing Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Higher Education Red Guards, and Middle School Red Guards are currently actively preparing to hold classes for studying Chairman Mao's works, determined to turn factories, villages, and schools into red Mao Zedong Thought schools. The Beijing Farmers' Congress, in a decision to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," requires the responsible comrades from all levels of farmers' congresses to personally lead, establish special leading bodies, take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's extremely important speech at the National Day celebration, and establish a system of instructors for studying Chairman Mao's works.

According to Xinhua News Agency, our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" have greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Shanghai. On October 4, some revolutionary mass organizations and leading members of the revolutionary committees at the grassroots level in Shanghai held a study session on Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech at the National Day celebration in the capital. Their speeches expressed the determination of the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Shanghai to firmly respond to, firmly implement, and earnestly understand and carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

These revolutionary mass organizations and leading members of the revolutionary committees at the grassroots level pointed out that at this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the latest instructions on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." We must, under the guidance of this great policy, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, further carry out revolutionary criticism, further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units, seize the revolution, and promote production. We must strive to be models of supporting the army and loving the people, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

"The only way to better carry out the struggle against revisionism is to thoroughly struggle against the 'self.'" Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important instructions have deeply educated and greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shanghai. At the study session, the leading members of various revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary committees at the grassroots level all talked about how struggling against selfishness means using Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against individualism and other non-proletarian thoughts in our minds. Criticizing revisionism means using Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, from criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pi-xian and Cao Qi-qiu, to eliminating the poison of revisionism at the grassroots level. They pointed out that to criticize revisionism, one must struggle against selfishness; only by struggling against selfishness can one better criticize revisionism. Thoroughly struggling against the "self" means uprooting the roots of revisionism and building an iron wall in one's mind to prevent and resist revisionism.

Some comrades, in connection with the actual class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-road struggle in their units, especially emphasized the importance of breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit after the proletarian revolutionary cadres take power. They said: with the change in status, our revolutionary cadres have taken on heavier responsibilities and more arduous tasks, and the party and the people have higher demands on us. Only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and constantly being on guard against the infiltration of bourgeois ideas can we hold power well for the proletariat and use power well. At the same time, with the change in status, the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeoisie will come out to praise us, cheer for us, and sing our praises, attempting to use two-faced revolutionary methods to subvert the proletarian dictatorship. But some of our comrades, due to the "self" in their minds, hear things like "firm leftists" and "resounding rebels," and their minds start ringing and their feet start wavering, causing losses to our proletarian revolutionary cause. Therefore, as proletarian revolutionary fighters, especially the leading comrades of revolutionary mass organizations, we must, in this great revolution that touches people's souls, always place the solution of the worldview problem in a very important position. We must both regard ourselves as a force for the revolution and as an object of the revolution, be vanguards in the struggle against selfishness, and pioneers in the criticism of revisionism.

How to struggle against selfishness and revisionism? How to turn Shanghai into a school of Mao Zedong Thought? Everyone, with hearts full of boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, excitedly said: the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must further launch a surging mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly make Chairman Mao's instructions etched in our minds, melted in our blood, and realized in our actions, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, and drive everything forward. Vice Chairman Lin Biao instructed: "Various study classes should be opened, by the central authorities, by local authorities, and by various revolutionary mass organizations. The whole country should be turned into a school of Mao Zedong Thought." We proletarian revolutionary cadres in Shanghai will resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's great call with actual actions. Currently, Shanghai, from the municipal revolutionary committee to the grassroots units, has universally opened classes for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Proletarian revolutionary cadres, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards have, through study, significantly raised their political awareness and ideological level.

    北京上海无产阶级革命派认真学习深刻领会毛主席最新指示
    只有很好地斗私　才能更好地批修
    大学特学毛主席著作，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，特别要大学“老三篇”，让“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想成为我们一切行动的指南，在斗私批修中立新功。
    据新华社六日讯　北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中学红代会的负责人，听到林彪副主席在国庆讲话中传达毛主席关于“斗私，批修”的最新指示后，立即深入进行学习，反复领会这一指示的伟大战略意义。他们在畅谈学习心得体会时一致认为，
  “斗私，批修”，是伟大领袖毛主席发出的最新战斗号令，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展新形势下的一项具有深远意义的重大战略措施，是无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的指路明灯。
    北京市工代会负责人说，我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，我们一定要坚决贯彻执行“斗私，批修”的伟大指示，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的新高潮，更广泛、更深入地开展革命的大批判，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，狠抓革命，猛促生产，要让毛泽东思想在自己头脑中深深扎根，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍首都各个工厂企业。中学红代会的负责人说，伟大领袖毛主席对我们青少年一代寄予无限的希望。我们一定不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的关怀和希望，做“斗私，批修”的尖兵和闯将，大学特学毛主席著作，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，特别要大学“老三篇”，让“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想成为我们一切行动的指南。
    他们在学习中都特别强调指出，批修必须斗私，斗私要结合批修。他们说，“私”字是资产阶级世界观的核心，是修正主义生存和发展的天然土壤。只有斗掉“私”字，才能彻底批倒修正主义，挖掉修正主义的根子。同时，也只有在向修正主义的斗争中，在对以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的批判中，不断用毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作顽强的斗争，斗私才不是一句空话。首都大专院校红代会负责人在谈到这方面的体会时说，无产阶级革命派不很好地斗“私”，就不能很好地完成革命的大批判、革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”和本单位的斗批改这些光荣而又艰巨的任务。
    大专院校红代会负责人还谈到知识分子向工农兵学习、同工农结合的必要性。
    北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会和中学红代会目前都在积极准备举办毛主席著作学习班，决心把工厂、农村、学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。北京市农代会在关于坚决响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召的一项决定中，要求各级农代会负责人亲自挂帅，建立专门的领导班子，带头学习毛主席这一最新指示和林彪副主席在国庆大会上的极为重要的讲话，建立毛主席著作学习辅导员制度。
    据新华社上海六日电　我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的“斗私，批修”的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众。十月四日，上海部分革命群众组织和基层单位革命委员会的领导成员，学习座谈了毛主席的最新指示和林彪副主席在首都国庆节庆祝大会上的重要讲话。他们的发言，集中地表达了上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众对毛主席最新指示坚决响应，坚决照办，认真领会，认真执行的决心。
    这些革命群众组织和基层单位革命委员会的领导成员指出，当前，在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席又发出了“斗私，批修”最新指示。我们一定要在“斗私，批修”这一伟大方针指引下，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，进一步开展革命大批判，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的
  “三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，争做拥军爱民的模范，巩固无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    “只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”林彪副主席的这一重要指示，给上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众以深刻的教育和极大的启示。在学习座谈会上，各革命群众组织和基层单位革命委员会领导成员都谈到，斗私，就是用毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的个人主义等非无产阶级思想作斗争。批修，就是用毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，从批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流，直到肃清基层单位中的修正主义流毒。他们指出，为了批修，就要斗私；也只有斗私，才能更好地批修。彻底斗倒了“私”字，就是挖掉了修正主义的根子，在自己的头脑里，筑起一道反修防修的钢铁长城。
    有些同志联系本单位两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，特别着重谈到了无产阶级革命派掌权以后，破私立公的重要性。他们说：随着地位的变化，我们革命派担子更重了，任务更艰巨了，党和人民对我们的要求也更高了。只有用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，时刻警惕资产阶级思想的侵蚀，才能为无产阶级掌好权，用好权。同时，随着地位的变化，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级也会出来捧场、喝采、唱“赞歌”，妄图用反革命两面手法颠覆无产阶级政权。而我们有些同志，由于头脑里“私”字作怪，听了什么“坚定的左派呀”，“响当当的造反派呀”等等，“头脑里就响当当，脚跟就摇晃晃”，给我们无产阶级革命事业带来损失。因此，作为无产阶级革命派战士，尤其是革命群众组织的负责人，一定要在这场触及人们灵魂的大革命中，自始至终把解决世界观的问题放在十分重要的地位，既要把自己当作革命的一份力量，又要把自己作为革命的对象，在斗私中当先锋，在批修中当闯将。
    用什么来斗私批修？怎么样把上海建设成毛泽东思想大学校？大家都怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情激动地说：最根本的根本，就是活学活用毛主席著作。要进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的波澜壮阔的群众运动，真正做到把毛主席的指示铭刻在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，带动一切。林彪副主席指示：“要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。”我们上海无产阶级革命派坚决以实际行动响应林彪副主席的伟大号召。目前，上海从市革委会到基层单位普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班。无产阶级革命派、革命干部和红卫兵革命小将通过学习，政治觉悟、思想水平有了很大提高。
