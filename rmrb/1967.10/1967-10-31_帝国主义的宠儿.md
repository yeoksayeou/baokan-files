Lenin once used his sharp and satirical pen to denounce the traitor to the proletariat, Kautsky, saying: “If I were Krupp or Scheidemann, Clemenceau or Reynaud, I would certainly reward Kautsky with a million in compensation, and reward him with Judas' kiss.”

This great traitor Kautsky did not have the chance to receive this reward from the bourgeoisie before he died. However, today, the Soviet revisionist leadership, which has inherited Kautsky's traitorous cause, has this good fortune. Not too early, not too late, just as the Soviet revisionist clique is loudly celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the “Nobel Prize Committee,” which follows the instructions of American imperialism, is “considering” nominating the head of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, Kosygin, as a candidate for the 1967 “Peace Prize.” This is indeed a historical irony!

What exactly is the “Nobel Prize”? The French bourgeois writer Paul Sartre once pointed out that it is “an honor reserved for Western writers and Eastern traitors.” The Vienna-based newspaper _Heute_ went so far as to call it “the anti-communist Nobel Prize.” Even the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, _Pravda_, a few years ago, did not hesitate to say that the “reactionary bourgeoisie uses the Nobel Prize to reward those who slander the socialist revolution and the Soviet people.” Imperialism uses it to buy and reward those who loyally serve their anti-communist, anti-people “cause” and make “contributions.” The notorious anti-communist Bunin, the infamous imperialist Marshall, and the black aristocrat Martin Luther King, who actively assisted the U.S. ruling class in suppressing the black movement, have all been recipients of this “prize.”

So, when Washington's masters are looking for recipients of the “Nobel Prize,” how could they not immediately set their sights on Kosygin, this “Eastern traitor”? It is precisely this Kosygin and his gang who have fully restored capitalism in the Soviet Union, realizing the dream that imperialism has long sought after. It is precisely this Kosygin and his gang who, with all their might, serve American imperialism's policy of aggression in Vietnam, the Middle East, and other regions, becoming its most effective number one accomplice in carrying out its counter-revolutionary “global strategy.” Who could be more to the liking of Washington's masters than Kosygin?

This time, Kosygin, along with the Vatican's cleric Paul VI and the American imperialist lackey U Thant in the United Nations, being listed as candidates is certainly not a coincidence. These three individuals, in recent years, have each shown their prowess in different positions, making significant contributions to the “peace” cause of American imperialism, especially in pushing the “peace talks” fraud in Vietnam, they have exerted all their efforts, playing a role that American imperialism cannot play. Moreover, they mutually appreciate and closely cooperate with each other.

Needless to say, Kosygin receiving such recognition from imperialism is obviously flattered and proud. However, the people of the world, through this matter, see even more clearly the traitorous face of Kosygin and his ilk.

### 帝国主义的宠儿

    帝国主义的宠儿
    列宁曾经以辛辣的讽刺笔调斥责无产阶级叛徒考茨基说：“假如我是克虏伯或谢德曼，是克列孟梭或列诺得尔，我一定会用百万酬金酬谢考茨基，用犹大的接吻奖赏他”。
    考茨基这个大叛徒还没有来得及从资产阶级那儿获取这份奖赏就死了。而今天，继承了考茨基叛徒事业的苏修领导集团，却有此幸运。不迟不早，就在苏修集团大吹大擂要纪念十月革命五十周年的时候，奉行美帝国主义意旨的“诺贝尔奖金委员会”正在“考虑”把苏修叛徒集团的头目柯西金，列为一九六七年“和平奖金”的得奖候选人。这的确是一个历史的讽刺！
      “诺贝尔奖金”究竟是个什么东西？法国的资产阶级作家保罗·萨特曾经指出，它是“一种保留给西方作家和东方叛徒的荣誉”。维也纳出版的《海内·库里尔》报则干脆称之为“反对共产主义的诺贝尔奖金”。就是苏修集团的喉舌《真理报》几年以前也毫不隐讳地说过，“反动的资产阶级用诺贝尔奖金奖赏的”“是诬蔑社会主义革命和苏联人民的诽谤者”。帝国主义就是拿它来收买和犒赏那些忠实地为他们反共、反人民的“事业”效劳并做出“贡献”的奴才和走狗的。极端仇恨十月革命、逃亡巴黎的白俄作家蒲宁，臭名昭著的帝国主义分子马歇尔，积极协助美国统治集团镇压黑人运动的黑人贵族马丁·路德·金之流，都曾经是这个“奖金”的获得者。
    那末，今天华盛顿的老爷们在物色颁发“诺贝尔奖金”的对象时，怎能不是一眼就看中柯西金这个“东方叛徒”呢？正是这个柯西金及其一伙在苏联全面复辟了资本主义，实现了帝国主义多少年来梦寐以求的“理想”。正是柯西金这一伙，不遗余力地为美帝国主义在越南、在中东以及其它地区的侵略政策效劳，成为它推行反革命“全球战略”最得力的头号帮凶。难道还有谁比柯西金更合乎华盛顿老爷们的心意的吗？
    这一次，柯西金同梵蒂冈的神棍保罗六世和联合国中的美帝走卒吴丹，一块儿被列在候选人的名单中，也绝非偶然。这三个人，近年来在不同的岗位上各显神通，为美帝国主义的“和平”事业立下了汗马功劳，特别是在越南问题上推销“和谈”骗局，更是卖尽了力气，起到了美帝国主义所不能起的作用。何况他们之间，又是互相器重，密切配合的呢？
    不消说，柯西金得到帝国主义这样的赏识，显然是受宠若惊，而且引以为荣的。但是，全世界人民从这件事情中，却更加看清了柯西金之流的叛徒面目。
