Celebrating the Glorious Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line Over 18 Years and the Greatest Achievements of the Cultural Revolution

Chairman Mao Celebrates National Day with 500,000 Military and Civilians in the Capital

During the grand celebration and parade inspection on this great national day, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, were spirited and radiant, frequently waving to the crowd and extending greetings for the holiday. Millions of revolutionary masses joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

Comrade Lin Biao delivered an extremely important speech. He said, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. This is the first great revolution initiated by the proletariat within a proletarian dictatorship in the history of the international communist movement. This is Chairman Mao's brilliant, creative, and epoch-making development of Marxism-Leninism. He said, Chairman Mao recently instructed us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Fighting selfishness means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the "self" in one's mind. Criticizing revisionism means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These two tasks are interconnected; only by thoroughly eliminating the "self," can we better carry the struggle against revisionism to the end. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, using "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, to strengthen the ideological education of military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards.

Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and other central leaders, as well as responsible comrades from various sectors and revolutionary friends and guests from various countries, joined Chairman Mao in inspecting the parade.

New China News Agency, October 1st: Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum on October 1st to celebrate the glorious national day of the Chinese people—the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The sun rises, the earth turns red. Amidst the favorable domestic and international situation today, and the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hearts of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people turn towards the red sun, towards Tiananmen. A grand national day celebration and parade inspection were held at Tiananmen Square.

This is a celebration to acclaim the glorious victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over 18 years!

This is an inspection to celebrate the greatest achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao recently inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions and returned to Beijing. Today, he is once again among the people celebrating the festival. Chairman Mao is always with the people, and the people are always with Chairman Mao. Throughout the entire national day celebration and parade inspection, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, were spirited and radiant, frequently waving to the crowd and extending greetings for the holiday.

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

Millions of revolutionary masses shouted and jumped with joy, their hearts surging with waves of emotion and tears of happiness. A thousand words and ten thousand feelings welled up in their hearts. A common sentiment was: Chairman Mao is in excellent health and full of energy! This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people! This is the greatest happiness for the people of the world!

When the morning sun began to rise, the vast crowds had already gathered at Tiananmen Square and the wide avenues to the east. People faced the red sun, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations over and over, and singing praises to the Chairman they yearned for day and night.

Chairman Mao arrived, the most blessed moment finally came!

At 10 o'clock sharp, the orchestra played "The East Is Red." Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum.

At this moment, nearly ten thousand people at Tiananmen Square held bouquets and flower balls, forming a magnificent pattern: the sun rising in the east, rays shining brightly. The joyous crowd instantly seemed like rolling waves of the East China Sea, red waves surging, everyone waving the red revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting joyfully, wishing our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life, eternal life, eternal life! The fluttering red flags were like fire, and the thunderous cheers were like spring thunder.

Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao and our deputy commander-in-chief, delivered an extremely important speech at the meeting. He first, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extended the most enthusiastic greetings to the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army throughout the country, to the Red Guards throughout the country, to the revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and people of all ethnic groups throughout the country! He expressed heartfelt welcome to comrades and friends from all over the world!

Comrade Lin Biao said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao has spread throughout China. Hundreds of millions of people have been mobilized. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, they have thoroughly defeated the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further liberated the productive forces. Our industrial production has achieved continuous victories. Our agricultural production has achieved a good harvest for the sixth consecutive year. Our markets are thriving, and prices are stable. The success of our hydrogen bomb explosion marks a new level in the development of our science and technology. More importantly, this cultural revolution has educated the masses, educated the youth, greatly promoted the ideological transformation of the people of the whole country, promoted the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups, tempered the cadres, and tempered the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Our great motherland has never been as strong as it is today.

He said, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. This is the first great revolution initiated by the proletariat within a proletarian dictatorship in the history of the international communist movement. This is Chairman Mao's brilliant, creative, and epoch-making development of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Lin Biao stressed that our current most important task is to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, adhere to Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and guidelines on the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, firmly grasp the revolutionary direction of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao's instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and in the great criticism of the revolution, combine the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution, consolidate and develop the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

He said, Chairman Mao recently instructed us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Fighting selfishness means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the "self" in one's mind. Criticizing revisionism means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These two tasks are interconnected; only by thoroughly eliminating the "self," can we better carry the struggle against revisionism to the end. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, using "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, to strengthen the ideological education of military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. We should establish various study classes, centrally organized, locally organized, and revolutionary mass organizations can also organize them, turning the whole country into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. Through study, we help our old cadres, new cadres, and revolutionary youngsters to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, raise their ideological and political level, and do new things for the people.

Comrade Lin Biao said, we must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," vigorously promote the development of our industrial and agricultural production, and rapidly improve our scientific and technological level. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to launch the "support the army and love the people" movement. Strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of domestic and foreign class enemies.

At 10:20 AM, under the guidance of the giant statue of Chairman Mao, the mass parade began. Five hundred thousand people from various ethnic groups and sectors, along with soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, full of enthusiasm, accepted the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as other Party and state leaders, and marched proudly through Tiananmen Square. The majestic Tiananmen Rostrum had a giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the center of the red wall. The slogans on the red walls on both sides of the Tiananmen Rostrum read: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" In front of the Monument to the People's Heroes to the south of the square, there was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. In front of the evergreen pines and cypresses on both the east and west sides of the square, there were portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

The vanguard team, consisting of more than thirty thousand soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, revolutionary Red Guards, and teachers and students from colleges and universities, were full of vigor and vitality. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army at the front of the team were guarding the national flag and emblem, demonstrating that the people's children are the reliable pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the great wall defending the country and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When the giant relief sculptures of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao appeared in the parade, everyone was overjoyed and excited about the new era of the world entering with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, who scientifically, systematically, and profoundly analyzed the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society for the first time in the history of Marxism, elucidated the laws of class struggle in socialist society, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. All the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China over the past year are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought! They are the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

In the joyous parade, there were giant banners such as "Firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle," showing the determination of the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses to further carry out the great criticism of the revolution, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, develop and consolidate the great alliance of the revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Revolutionary study classes of Chairman Mao's works have been set up in the industrial, agricultural, and educational fronts in the capital. Many members of the study classes and active learners of Chairman Mao's works from various fronts participated in the parade today. They are determined to take "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, to set up study classes of Chairman Mao's works on various fronts, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective world, guide the great criticism of the revolution, and turn the various fronts in the capital into big schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

The heroic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, proudly holding high the giant banner with Vice Chairman Lin Biao's latest inscription "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," marched triumphantly through Tiananmen Square. Today, those inspected by Chairman Mao included representatives of soldiers who have followed Chairman Mao in countless battles over the years and have made great contributions in carrying out the "three supports, two military" tasks, a large number of active learners of Chairman Mao's works who have achieved new levels in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, heroes who have guarded the coastal and border defenses day and night and shot down enemy planes in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and those who have made great contributions to the successful hydrogen bomb test. The powerful assistants of the People's Liberation Army—the militia—also accepted the inspection together with the army. The magnificent parade of the People's Liberation Army showed that this shining example of the whole country actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works has now shone with new brilliance in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and this great and glorious wall has now created immortal achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! When the heroic troops of the army appeared at Tiananmen Square, the revolutionary masses shouted over and over again: "Salute to the great People's Liberation Army!" "We must liberate Taiwan!" People unanimously praised the People's Liberation Army as truly the people's children created by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, truly the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

On the eve of the festival, the revolutionary workers of the capital's industrial and transportation fronts, who took the lead in achieving revolutionary unity, today marched towards Tiananmen Square with joy and pride, bringing the double victory of revolution and production. This is a united revolutionary team, this is the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital. The "Revolutionary Criticism Column" float in the workers' team was particularly eye-catching. The proletarian workers of the capital, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, rushed onto the battlefield of the great criticism of the revolution, fiercely exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev. They actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," leading the revolution to take the lead, to be in command, and to promote production, striving to be revolutionary pioneers and models of production, determined to turn the factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. Among the floats in the workers' team, there was a giant model showing that the revolutionary workers of the national printing and publishing industry will produce 80 million sets of the red treasure book—"Selected Works of Mao Zedong"—this year, there were scenes of coal miners and steel workers working hard day and night to add bricks and tiles to the socialist edifice of our country, there were models of trains and trucks running day and night, and models of precision coordinate boring machines with world-advanced levels, etc. All this fully showed that the broad masses of workers in the capital have used the surging momentum released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve new achievements on the construction front.

The parade team of the suburban communes of Beijing came. Tractors pulled two floats, high above which were the giant models of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and the red flags of "Long live the communes!" loaded with models of abundant grain, cotton, vegetables, and fruits. In the farmers' team, there were active learners of Chairman Mao's works and brave pioneers of the great criticism of the revolution who emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of commune members, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, set up battlefields in the villages and fields, verbally and in writing, fiercely criticized the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Chairman Mao issued the great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres enthusiastically responded and carried it out. The suburbs of Beijing were filled with songs of victory, and good news came one after another. After the summer harvest this year, the autumn harvest was also good. Grain, cotton, oil, vegetables, and fruits were all abundant. The commune members on the advancing floats held "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang and danced. All this concentratedly showed that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the five hundred million peasants in our country, the root of all victories.

The vigorous Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from colleges and universities in the capital, surrounding the portrait of Chairman Mao, held up countless red flags, marched through Tiananmen Square. The great leader Chairman Mao waved to them affectionately! The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students jumped and shouted excitedly, waving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," thousands of times to the red sun on Tiananmen, shouting in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" These revolutionary pioneers who have charged into the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made a solemn pledge to Chairman Mao: We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out the great criticism of the revolution, consolidate and strengthen the great alliance of the revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, and explore the educational revolution. We will definitely learn from the People's Liberation Army, walk the road of combining with workers and peasants. We will definitely better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," while transforming the objective world, also transform the subjective world, constantly enhance revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and strive to train ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which began with the great criticism in the cultural field, has already made the cultural circle in our country a new look. The cultural warriors dressed in workers', peasants', and soldiers' uniforms, surrounding the giant statue of Chairman Mao, carried the giant banner "Advancing along the revolutionary line of literature and art advocated by Chairman Mao," walked at the forefront of the cultural army. Following them, a thousand-people strong dragon dance team, guarding the brilliant works of Chairman Mao—"Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the five documents on literature and art, sang and danced, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao, who clearly, completely, and thoroughly put forward the fundamental direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics, and opened up a new historical era for proletarian revolutionary literature and art.

The cultural warriors of the People's Liberation Army, carrying the model of "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literature and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao on Behalf of Comrade Jiang Qing," holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," marched proudly through Tiananmen Square. The heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the eight model operas—revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern," "The Detachment," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Attack on the White Tiger Regiment," revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," revolutionary symphony "The Detachment," and revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Harbor"—stood proudly under the red flags on eight stage performance floats, marking that workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken the stage as masters, and the era of emperors, generals, gentlemen, and ladies ruling the stage has gone forever. These eight model operas are the victory fruits of the brave warriors of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Jiang Qing, leading the proletarian revolutionary forces in the cultural circle to firmly fight against the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, and are the proletarian literary and artistic models shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the cultural army, a large team appeared—the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. This new cultural team went deep into factories, villages, and troops, widely spreading Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Today, they brought models of Mao's quotations and Mao's quotations songs to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao.

A float with the golden "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" stood tall! The dance team dressed in various ethnic costumes, surrounded the float, shouting and jumping, singing joyfully. They carried a giant banner expressing their unshakable determination: Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!

The mass parade fully demonstrated the spirit of solidarity and struggle of the people of our country with the oppressed people and oppressed nations of the world. People continuously shouted slogans, expressing the iron will of the people of our country to firmly support the great anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people, firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. When the parade team carried giant banners such as "Down with American imperialism!" and "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" passing the reviewing stand, comrades and friends from the five continents of the world, some raised their tightly clenched fists high, and some shouted slogans passionately. Tiananmen Square echoed with the roar of unity and struggle: Workers of the world, unite! Workers of the world, unite with the oppressed people and oppressed nations!

At noon, all the parade teams passed through Tiananmen Square, and nearly ten thousand Red Guards and revolutionary students, as well as workers, cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, gathered at the south side of the square. They waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and colorful bouquets and flower balls, joyfully shouting to Chairman Mao, countless balloons with the words "Long live Chairman Mao!" soared into the sky. On the reviewing stand at the edge of the Golden Water Bridge, comrades and friends from the five continents of the world, active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the People's Liberation Army, heroes and models of the "three supports, two military" tasks, and representatives of the revolutionary cadres from various fronts in the capital, as well as representatives of compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao and overseas Chinese, shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and other Party and state leaders frequently waved to the cheering crowd. At this moment, the festive atmosphere on and below the Tiananmen Rostrum reached its peak. Our country has never been as united as it is today, and the people of all ethnic groups in our country have never been as united as they are today.

    千千万万革命群众欢呼跳跃，心潮逐浪热泪流，千言万语涌心头。一个共同的心声是：毛主席身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛，这是中国人民的最大幸福！这是世界人民的最大幸福！
    当朝晖初升的时候，浩浩荡荡的群众队伍早已汇集到了天安门广场和广场东侧的宽阔大道上。人们迎着红太阳，一遍遍诵读毛主席语录，一支支颂歌献给心中日夜想念的毛主席。
    毛主席来了，最最幸福的时刻终于盼到了！
    十时正，乐队高奏《东方红》。毛主席和林彪副主席登上天安门城楼。
    这时，天安门广场上近十万人手持花束、花球，组成一幅极为壮观的图案：旭日东升，光芒万丈。欢腾不已的群众队伍，顿时好比滚滚东海，红浪滔天，人人挥动着红色革命宝书《毛主席语录》纵情欢呼，敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆，万寿无疆！那飘飘大旗红似火，那阵阵欢呼如春雷。就在这春雷般的欢呼声中，写着“毛主席万岁”金色大字的五个巨型气球宫灯，凌空高悬，辉映蓝天。

    十时许，中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理、北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治同志，宣布国庆大典开始，国歌高奏，礼炮齐鸣。
    毛主席的亲密战友，我们的副统帅林彪同志，在大会上发表了极为重要的讲话。他首先代表我们伟大的领袖毛主席，代表党中央、中华人民共和国政府、中央军委和中央文革小组，向全国的工人们、农民们、人民解放军的指战员们，向全国的红卫兵们、全国的革命干部、革命知识分子和全国各族人民，致最热烈的敬礼！向来自世界各国的同志们、朋友们，表示衷心地欢迎！
    林彪同志说，毛主席亲自发动，亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动，普遍到全中国。几亿人民发动起来了。他们在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，打得落花流水，全面崩溃。无产阶级文化大革命进一步解放了生产力。我们的工业生产胜利的捷报，正在不断传来。我们的农业获得了连续第六年的好收成。我们的市场繁荣，物价稳定。我国氢弹爆炸的成功，标志着我国科学技术发展的新水平。更为重要的是，这场文化大革命，教育了群众，教育了青年，大大地促进了全国人民的思想革命化，促进了各族人民的大团结，锻炼了干部，锻炼了人民解放军全体指战员。我们伟大的祖国，从来没有象今天这样强大。
    他说，我们的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。这是国际共产主义运动历史上，在无产阶级专政的国家内，由无产阶级自己发动的第一次大革命。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的天才的、创造性的划时代的新发展。
    林彪同志强调指出：我们当前最重要的任务，就是遵循毛主席的教导，根据毛主席关于无产阶级专政下的革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，牢牢掌握毛主席指示的革命斗争大方向，跟紧毛主席的战略部署，在革命的大批判中，结合本单位的斗、批、改，巩固和发展革命的大联合，巩固和发展革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    他说，毛主席最近指示我们，要斗私，批修。斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了“私”字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，用“斗私，批修”这四个字为纲，加强对军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。通过学习，帮助我们的老干部，新干部和革命小将，活学活用毛泽东思想，改造自己头脑里各种非无产阶级思想，提高思想政治水平，为人民立新功。
    林彪同志说，我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，“抓革命，促生产”，大力促进我们的工农业生产的发展，迅速提高我们的科学技术水平。我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，开展“拥军爱民”运动。加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压国内外阶级敌人的破坏活动。
    上午十时二十分，在毛主席的巨大全身塑像的引导下，群众游行开始。五十万各族各界革命群众和解放军指战员满怀豪情，接受伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，以及党和国家其他领导人的检阅，意气风发地通过天安门广场。庄严雄伟的天安门城楼的红墙中央，高挂着毛主席的巨幅画像。天安门城楼两侧红墙上的标语写着：“中华人民共和国万岁！”“世界人民大团结万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”广场东西两侧的苍松翠柏前，竖着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的画像。广场南面的人民英雄纪念碑前，竖着孙中山的画像。
    由三万多名人民解放军、革命工人、革命的红卫兵和大中学校师生组成的前卫队，英姿焕发，朝气蓬勃。走在队伍最前面的人民解放军护卫着国旗和国徽，显示出人民子弟兵是无产阶级专政的可靠柱石，是保卫国防和无产阶级文化大革命的伟大长城。
    当马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛主席的巨大浮雕像出现在游行队伍里时，人们都为世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代无限欢欣鼓舞。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，在马克思主义发展史上第一次科学地、系统地、深刻地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，阐明了社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。我国无产阶级文化大革命一年来取得的所有辉煌成就，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！都是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    在欢腾的游行队伍里，展现出“紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向”等巨幅标语模型，显示了广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众决心进一步搞好革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，巩固和加强无产阶级专政的坚强决心。首都工业、农业和文教战线都试办了毛主席著作学习班，好多学习班的队员和从各条战线涌现出来的学习毛主席著作积极分子，今天参加了游行。他们决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，在各个战线上大办毛主席著作学习班，用毛泽东思想改造主观世界，指导革命的大批判，把首都各条战线都办成毛泽东思想大学校。
    无限忠于毛主席的英雄的人民解放军指战员，高抬着林彪副主席最新题词“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的巨幅标语牌，迈着胜利的步伐，雄赳赳，气昂昂，通过天安门广场。今天接受毛主席检阅的，有几十年跟随毛主席南征北战屡建战功、今天又在执行“三支”、“两军”任务中作出巨大贡献的指战员代表，有一贯活学活用毛主席著作、文化大革命中又学出用出了新水平的大批学习毛主席著作积极分子，有日日夜夜守卫祖国海防边防、在保卫无产阶级文化大革命中屡歼敌机的英雄战士，有参加氢弹试验成功的立功人员。人民解放军的有力助手——民兵，也和解放军一起接受了检阅。解放军威武雄壮的游行队伍的阵容向人们表明：这个全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的光辉榜样，如今在无产阶级文化大革命中又焕发出了灿烂的新光辉，这个伟大的光荣的长城，如今在无产阶级文化大革命中又创建了不朽的新功勋！当解放军的英雄队伍出现在天安门广场的时候，革命群众一遍又一遍高呼：“向伟大的中国人民解放军致敬！”“一定要解放台湾！”人们齐颂解放军真不愧是毛主席亲手缔造、林副主席亲自指挥的举世无双的人民子弟兵，真不愧是无产阶级专政的坚强支柱。
    节日前夕在实现革命的大联合中一马当先的首都工业交通战线的革命职工，今天带着革命和生产双胜利的喜悦，昂首阔步地向天安门广场迈进。这是一支革命的团结的队伍，这是首都无产阶级文化大革命的一支主力军。工人队伍中的“革命大批判专栏”彩车，特别引人注目。首都工人阶级以毛泽东思想为武器，冲杀上革命大批判战场，狠揭猛批以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。他们积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以革命来带头，来挂帅，来促进生产，争当革命的闯将，誓作生产的模范，决心把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。行驶在工人队伍行列的彩车群里，有表明全国印刷、出版战线的革命职工将在今年生产八千万套红色宝书——《毛泽东选集》的巨幅模型，有日夜为我国社会主义大厦添砖加瓦的煤矿工人和钢铁工人紧张劳动的场景，有夜以继日奔驰的火车、汽车等交通运输车辆模型，有具有世界先进水平的精密座标镗床模型，等等。这一切，充分显示了首都广大职工把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上去，在建设战线上取得的新成绩。
    京郊农村人民公社社员的游行队伍过来了。拖拉机牵引着的两辆彩车，高高地竖起《毛泽东著作选读》的巨大模型和“人民公社万岁”的红旗，满载着丰收的粮食、棉花、蔬菜和水果等模型。在农民的队伍里，有在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的活学活用毛主席著作积极分子和革命大批判的勇猛闯将。广大社员以毛泽东思想为武器，在村头、地头摆开战场，口诛笔伐，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。毛主席发出“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，广大贫下中农和革命干部热烈响应，坚决照办。京郊农村，凯歌阵阵，捷报频传，继今年夏季丰收之后，秋季又是好年景，粮、棉、油、菜、水果，样样丰收。徐徐前进的彩车上，人民公社社员手持《毛主席语录》，又歌又舞。这一切，集中地显示了毛泽东思想是我国五亿农民的灵魂，是取得一切胜利的根本。
    朝气勃勃的首都红卫兵和大专院校、中等学校的革命师生们，簇拥着毛主席画像，高举着无数面红旗，通过天安门广场。伟大领袖毛主席向他们亲切招手了！红卫兵小将和革命师生们激动地跳跃着，欢呼着，挥动红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，向着天安门上的红太阳，千遍万遍地同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”这些在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的革命闯将向毛主席立下了庄严的誓言：我们一定听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，搞好革命的大批判，巩固和加强革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，开展本单位的斗批改，作教育革命的探索者。我们一定向人民解放军学习，走与工农相结合的道路。一定更好地活学活用毛主席著作，“斗私，批修”在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，不断增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，努力把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    从文化领域中的大批判开始的我国无产阶级文化大革命，已经使我国文艺界面目一新。身穿工农兵服装的文艺战士，簇拥着毛主席巨大塑像，抬着“沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利前进”的巨型标语，走在文艺大军的最前头。紧接着，一千多人组成的秧歌舞蹈队，护卫着毛主席的光辉著作——《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和关于文艺的五个文件的巨大模型，载歌载舞，纵情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，是毛主席最明确、最完整、最彻底地提出了文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的根本方向，是毛主席为无产阶级革命文艺开辟了历史的新纪元。
    人民解放军文艺战士们，抬着《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》的模型，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，昂首阔步走过天安门广场。革命现代京剧《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》、《奇袭白虎团》，革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、
  《白毛女》，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》和革命现代京剧《海港》等八个样板戏中的工农兵高大的艺术形象，巍然屹立在八辆舞台表演彩车上的红旗下，标志着工农兵以主人翁的英雄姿态登上了文艺舞台，帝王将相少爷小姐统治舞台的时代已经一去不复返了。这八个革命样板戏，是无产阶级文化大革命的英勇战士江青同志领导文艺界无产阶级革命派，坚决与反革命修正主义文艺黑线斗争的胜利果实，是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级文艺典范。
    在文艺大军中，出现了一支人数众多的队伍——毛泽东思想宣传队。这支新生文艺队伍，深入工厂、农村、部队，广泛传播毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛主席革命路线。今天，他们带着毛主席语录画和毛主席语录歌的模型，来接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。
    矗立着金光闪闪四卷宝书——《毛泽东选集》的彩车过来了！穿着各民族服装的舞蹈队，围绕着彩车欢呼跳跃，纵情歌唱。他们抬着的一幅巨大标语，表达了他们坚定不移的决心：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！
    群众游行队伍充分表现出我国人民同全世界被压迫人民，被压迫民族的团结战斗的气概。人们不断高呼口号，表达出我国人民坚决支持越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的革命斗争，坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争的钢铁意志。当游行队伍抬着“打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！”“打倒以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义！”等巨幅标语经过观礼台时，来自世界五大洲的同志和朋友中，有的高高地举起紧握的拳头，有的激昂地高呼口号。天安门广场一次又一次发出团结战斗的吼声：全世界无产者联合起来！全世界无产者同被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来！
    中午十二时，全部游行队伍通过天安门广场，聚集在广场南面的红卫兵和革命师生，以及工人、干部、解放军指战员等近十万人，欢呼雀跃地涌到金水桥畔。他们挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》和色彩艳丽的花束、花球，尽情地向毛主席欢呼，无数的气球带着“毛主席万岁！”的标语腾空而起。金水桥畔的观礼台上来自世界五大洲的同志和朋友，人民解放军学习毛主席著作积极分子、“三支”、“两军”的有功人员，以及首都各条战线的无产阶级革命派代表，以及港澳同胞的代表和归国华侨的代表，同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，以及党和国家的其他领导人，频频向欢呼的人们招手致意。这时，天安门城楼上下的欢腾气氛达到高峰。我们的国家从来没有象今天这样统一，我国各族人民从来没有象今天这样团结。
