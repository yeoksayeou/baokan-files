The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China sternly exposes the crime of the reactionary clique in Burma of tearing up the Sino-Burmese economic and technological cooperation agreement

	We cannot tolerate the Ne Win reactionary government's tricks and rampant anti-China activities. The Burmese government must promptly give a clear response and seriously handle the five demands of the Chinese government.

	Xinhua News Agency reports: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China sent a note to the Burmese Embassy in China on the 4th, sternly exposing the crime of the Ne Win government in Burma of completely tearing up the economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma.

	The note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China refuted the note from the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 29 to the Chinese Embassy in Burma, and reiterated the demands of the Chinese government that the Ne Win government must: 1. Immediately stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, including various insults, provocations, and persecutions against Chinese experts; release all detained Chinese nationals; 2. Severely punish the ringleaders who attacked the Chinese Embassy and other institutions and killed Chinese experts and Chinese nationals; 3. Compensate for all losses of the Chinese Embassy and Chinese nationals, and provide relief to the families of the victims; 4. Guarantee the safety of the Chinese Embassy in Burma and other institutions and all Chinese personnel, including Chinese experts, and not restrict their normal activities; 5. Apologize publicly to the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

	The note pointed out that before these reasonable demands receive a satisfactory response, Chinese experts have no conditions to continue working. This situation is entirely created by the Ne Win government, and the responsibility lies entirely with the Ne Win government. The Ne Win government must promptly give a clear response and serious handling of the above demands of the Chinese government.

	The note said that the Ne Win government in Burma, in creating large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese political incidents, has completely torn up the economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma. However, the note from the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs still talks about how the "Union of Burma government does not consider that the recent unfortunate incidents will have any obstruction to the effective implementation of the economic and technological cooperation agreement between the two governments." This is truly a complete distortion of right and wrong, and a complete confusion of black and white.

	The note said that it is known to all that killing Chinese experts, destroying Chinese institutions in Rangoon that are in charge of aiding Burma, attacking the Chinese experts' guesthouse in Rangoon, looting and burning living supplies and other property used by Chinese experts, all of these are done by the Ne Win government's instigation of thugs. What's more, you keep organizing thugs to demonstrate and provoke at various construction sites of Chinese experts, insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in front of Chinese experts, sending military police to seize the offices of Chinese experts, closely monitoring and restricting the actions of Chinese experts, inciting Burmese workers to oppose Chinese experts, spreading rumors and slandering that Chinese experts are engaged in "spy activities," attempting to further persecute Chinese experts. All of these are inseparable parts of the Ne Win government's anti-China and anti-Chinese political incidents. Under these circumstances, what reason do you have to talk about the "effective implementation of the project"? On one hand, you kill Chinese experts and persecute Chinese experts in various ways, and on the other hand, you want Chinese experts to endure humiliation and continue working, otherwise, it is to sabotage the economic and technological cooperation agreement between the two countries. Is there such a logic in the world?

	The note pointed out that the Ne Win government is so blatantly sabotaging the economic and technological cooperation agreement between the two countries, trying to drive away Chinese experts, but still trying to push the responsibility onto China. This is absolutely not acceptable.

	The note said that for several months, the Chinese government has strongly protested and made serious demands on the Ne Win government's rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, but the Ne Win government has evaded and shifted the blame, played tricks, and avoided the various demands of the Chinese government. At the same time, the Ne Win government continues to organize anti-China and anti-Chinese activities nationwide, and the brutal persecution of the vast number of patriotic Chinese nationals has been increasing, and the slander and insult of Chinese experts have not stopped; the Ne Win government also uses official radio and newspapers to spread various rumors and slanders, which is something that the Chinese government and the Chinese people cannot tolerate.

    我外交部严正揭露缅甸反动派撕毁中缅经济技术合作协定的罪行
  　决不能容忍奈温反动政府玩弄花招猖狂反华
    缅甸政府必须对中国政府的五点要求迅速作出明确答复和认真处理
    新华社讯　中国外交部四日照会缅甸驻华大使馆，严正揭露缅甸奈温政府彻底撕毁中缅两国经济技术合作协定的罪行。
    中国外交部的照会驳斥了缅甸外交部八月二十九日给中国驻缅甸大使馆的来照，重申中国政府要求奈温政府必须：一、立即停止一切反华排华活动，包括向中国专家进行的各种侮辱挑衅和迫害活动；释放所有被捕华侨；二、严惩袭击中国大使馆和其他机构以及杀害中国专家和华侨的罪魁祸首；三、赔偿中国大使馆和华侨的一切损失，抚恤受难华侨的家属；四、保证中国驻缅甸大使馆和其他机构以及全体中国人员包括中国专家的安全，不得限制他们的正常活动；五、向中国政府和中国人民公开道歉。
    照会指出，在这些正当合理的要求得到令人满意的答复以前，中国专家根本没有继续工作的条件。这种情况完全是奈温政府一手造成的，其责任完全在奈温政府身上。奈温政府必须对中国政府的上述要求，迅速作出明确答复和认真的处理。
    照会说，缅甸奈温政府在制造大规模反华排华的政治事件中，彻底撕毁了中缅两国经济技术合作协定。但是，缅甸外交部的来照却侈谈什么“缅甸联邦政府并不认为最近的不幸事件对两国政府的经济技术合作协定工程的有效进行会有任何阻碍。”这真是颠倒是非，混淆黑白到了极点。
    照会说，众所周知，杀害中国专家，捣毁中国在仰光主持援缅工作的机构，袭击中国在仰光的专家招待所，抢劫和烧毁供中国专家使用的生活用品和其它财物，全部都是奈温政府指使暴徒干的。更有甚者，你们还不断组织暴徒向各工地的中国专家示威挑衅，在中国专家面前侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，派出军警强占中国专家的办公室，严密监视和限制中国专家的行动，煽动缅工人反对中国专家，造谣诽谤中国专家从事“间谍活动”，企图对中国专家进行更大规模的迫害。所有这一切，都是奈温政府反华排华的政治事件中不可分割的组成部分。在这种情况下，你们还有什么道理妄谈什么“工程的有效进行”呢？你们一面杀害中国专家，对中国专家进行种种迫害，同时还要中国专家忍气吞声，继续工作，不然就是破坏两国经济技术合作协定，天下有这样的道理吗？
    照会指出，奈温政府这样明目张胆地破坏两国经济技术合作协定，还要赶走中国专家，却又企图把责任推到中国身上。这是绝对办不到的。
    照会说，几个月来，中国政府对奈温政府疯狂反华排华，曾多次提出强烈抗议和严正要求，而奈温政府却百般抵赖，推卸罪责，玩弄花招，回避中国政府的各项要求。与此同时，奈温政府在全国各地继续组织反华排华活动，对于广大爱国华侨的残酷迫害有增无已，对中国专家的诬蔑侮辱也没有停止；奈温政府并利用官方电台和报纸进行各种造谣和诽谤，这是中国政府和中国人民决不能容忍的。
