Attempts to Escape Responsibility by "Trial" of the Assailant Who Injured Our Courier Will Not Succeed
The Reactionary Government of Burma is the Chief Culprit of Anti-China and Anti-Chinese Sentiments

	BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- YANGON, Oct. 16 -- The reactionary government of Burma staged a farce of "trial" of the assailant who injured Chinese courier Cao Dalin from late August to October 4. It attempted to wash away its responsibility for the large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese riots it orchestrated and organized, and took the opportunity to spread rumors and incite anti-Chinese sentiments to provoke a new wave of anti-China movements.

	In the attack on the Chinese Embassy organized by the Burmese reactionary government on June 28, four rioters broke into the embassy. One of them, after killing Chinese expert Liu Yihe and escaping with two other rioters, injured Chinese courier Cao Dalin. The assailant, Jin Mai, was caught on the spot. The Chinese Embassy personnel seized a document proving Jin Mai's military identity, a military dagger, and a military satchel he carried. Jin Mai admitted that he was a soldier who broke into the Chinese Embassy and stabbed Cao Dalin, and signed the confession. In the afternoon of the same day, at 4:30 PM, Jin Mai fully confessed his crime in the presence of U Oun Kyin, Executive Secretary of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and U Tin Kya, Deputy Commissioner of the Yangon Police. U Oun Kyin and others had to admit the facts in the face of witnesses and evidence and took the assailant Jin Mai away.

	To deceive public opinion and wash away its own responsibility, the Burmese reactionary government spent two months meticulously planning and rehearsing the farce of "trialing" Jin Mai. It even demanded that the Chinese Embassy "testify in court." The Chinese Embassy exposed the Burmese reactionary government's plot, firmly rejected its absurd demand, and solemnly pointed out that the chief culprit of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiments was the Ne Win government itself, and that the trial of Jin Mai was a complete hoax.

	During the "trial," the Burmese reactionary government fabricated a so-called "confession" for Jin Mai, completely reversing his admitted crime, and claimed that the assailant, who held a military ID, was a "laborer." It maliciously accused Jin Mai of entering the embassy to "save" four Burmese demonstrators who were lying in a pool of blood inside the embassy courtyard. This "confession" shamelessly denied the fact that Chinese courier Cao Dalin was stabbed, claiming that Jin Mai "did not know if he stabbed anyone during the fight with the Chinese."

	Even more foolish and clumsy was the claim in the "confession" that Jin Mai's confession, made in the presence of high-ranking Burmese officials after being caught by the Chinese Embassy personnel, was "forced" out of him, despite the fact that a battalion of armed Burmese soldiers surrounded the Chinese Embassy at the time.

	The Burmese reactionary government's court, based solely on the "confession" fabricated by the Burmese reactionary government for Jin Mai, sentenced Jin Mai to only three months in prison for "trespassing" and immediately released him, claiming that Jin Mai had already been detained for 98 days.

	It is well known that the Burmese reactionary government itself is the chief culprit of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiments and the mastermind behind the assailant Jin Mai. With witnesses and evidence at hand, its attempt to deceive and escape responsibility by manipulating judicial procedures will never succeed. Instead, its clumsy performance only further exposes itself.

　　妄图用“审判”刺伤我信使的凶手来逃避罪责绝不能得逞
　　缅甸反动政府是反华排华的罪魁祸首
    新华社十六日讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府在八月底到十月四日之间上演了一出“审判”刺伤中国外交信使曹达林的凶手的丑剧，妄图洗刷它一手策划和组织的大规模反华排华暴行的罪责，并且趁机大肆造谣，煽动反华情绪，以便掀起新的反华浪潮。
    在缅甸反动政府六月二十八日组织的对中国大使馆进行的一次袭击中，有四名暴徒闯入中国大使馆行凶，其中的一个暴徒杀害了中国援缅专家刘逸后和另外两名暴徒一起越墙逃走，刺伤中国外交信使曹达林的凶手金貌被当场捉住。中国大使馆人员当场缴获了证明金貌的军人身份的一张证件，以及他携带的一把军用匕首和一只军用挂包。金貌供认，他是一个军人，闯入了中国使馆，用刀刺伤了曹达林，并在供词上签了字。当天下午四时半，金貌又当着缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦和仰光专区警察副总监吴庭叫的面，完全承认了他的罪行。吴翁钦等在人证物证面前，也不得不承认事实，并且带走了凶手金貌。
    缅甸反动政府为了欺骗公众舆论，洗刷自己的罪责，在过去的两个月时间里，精心策划并专门排演了“审判”金貌的丑剧。它甚至要求中国大使馆“出庭作证”。中国大使馆戳穿了缅甸反动政府的阴谋，坚决拒绝了它的这一荒谬的要求，并且严正指出，反华排华的罪魁祸首就是奈温政府自己，审判金貌完全是个大骗局。
    在“审判”中，缅甸反动政府为金貌编造了一个所谓“供词”，完全推翻了他所供认的罪行，把这个持有军人证件的凶手说成是“小工”，并且用心险恶地倒打一耙说什么金貌是在“看到中国使馆院内有四个缅甸示威者倒在血泊中”以后，“为了救他们而越进使馆的”。这篇“供词”无耻地否认了中国外交信使曹达林被刺伤的事实，说什么金貌在“与中国人搏斗时不知是否刺伤对方……。”
    更为愚蠢和拙劣的是，凶手金貌在被中国大使馆人员捉住后，当着缅甸高级官员的面供认他的罪行时，有一营左右荷枪实弹的缅甸军队包围着中国大使馆，但是，“供词”却胡说什么金貌在这种情况下作出的口供是被“逼”出来的。
    缅甸反动政府的法庭以缅甸反动政府为金貌编造的“供词”作为唯一的“依据”，宣布金貌的罪名只是“闯入使馆”，判处他三个月的徒刑，同时又声称因为金貌已被押九十八天，而把他立即释放。
    人所共知，缅甸反动政府自己就是反华排华的罪魁祸首，就是凶手金貌的幕后指挥者。人证物证俱在，它妄图以玩弄司法程序来进行欺骗，逃避罪责的阴谋是决不能得逞的，相反地它的拙劣的表演只能是进一步的自我大暴露。
