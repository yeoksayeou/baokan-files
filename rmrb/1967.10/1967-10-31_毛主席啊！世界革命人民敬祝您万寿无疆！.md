Chairman Mao! The world's revolutionary people wish you eternal life!

Chairman Mao, you are the great teacher of all the people of the world. You are the symbol of victory for the world's revolutionary people. You are the brightest red sun in the hearts of all the people of the world. The five continents sing your praises, and all the people of the world sing your praises. No matter how many words we use, we cannot express the boundless love of all the people of the world for you. No matter how many songs we sing, we cannot sing enough to praise the boundless respect of the five continents for you. No matter how many pens and ink we use, we cannot write enough to express our boundless admiration for you. No matter how many languages of the five continents we use, we cannot express our boundless loyalty to you. Chairman Mao! The world's revolutionary people wish you eternal life! Eternal life! We enthusiastically shout long live Chairman Mao!

In the main hall of the hotel, there is a large statue of Chairman Mao. We guard it day and night. When the East is red and the sun rises, when the brilliant dawn first appears, a French friend who only knows three Chinese phrases walks up to the statue of Chairman Mao, raises a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and shouts in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" One morning, he walked up to us and, pointing to the tall statue of Chairman Mao, could not contain his excitement and shouted loudly, "Mao Zedong is the great leader of the Chinese people and also the great leader of the French people and all the people of the world. Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our times. Mao Zedong is the hope of humanity. Mao Zedong is the dawn of truth for our era. All the people of the world yearn for Mao Zedong and sing praises to the glorious name of Mao Zedong. With Mao Zedong, the people will definitely be liberated. With Mao Zedong, the world will see light like China."

This French friend said, "The Soviet revisionists madly oppose Chairman Mao. We must shout long live Chairman Mao! Shout long live Chairman Mao for our entire lives! Let the shout of long live Chairman Mao echo throughout every inch of France and every corner of the world. Let all the people of the world shout long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

One day, as we were walking to class with red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" in our hands, an Angolan friend with many different types of Chairman Mao badges on his chest walked up to us. He stopped in front of us and, pointing to the largest, shining gold Chairman Mao badge on his cap, proudly said, "I am so happy!" After a while, he clenched his teeth and angrily said, "They (referring to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries) forbid us Angolan people from wearing Chairman Mao badges, fearing that we will grasp Mao Zedong Thought. They say that wearing Chairman Mao badges is 'illegal.' How many of our Angolan brothers and sisters long to wear a shining gold Chairman Mao badge, thinking it is the greatest happiness and the greatest joy. Today, I have come to red China, the heart of the world revolution—Beijing. I am free! I will represent the Angolan people and forever wear the Chairman Mao badge, letting it shine brightly. Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the proletarian revolution in our times. They say the sky is high, but it cannot compare to Chairman Mao's prestige. I will wear the Chairman Mao badge on my chest. They say there are many stars, but they cannot compare to Chairman Mao's contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. I will wear a thousand, ten thousand Chairman Mao badges and still not have enough! The Angolan people will forever follow Chairman Mao, forever be heart to heart with Chairman Mao."

Singing Loudly for Mao Zedong

Once, friends from the five continents held a get-together, inviting us to participate. As soon as we entered the auditorium, the entire venue erupted in applause, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" After taking our seats, we sang songs from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and the foreign friends also joined in. Although our languages were different, we expressed the boundless love of all the people of the world for Chairman Mao. We shared a common wish: to wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

During the performance, an Arab friend stepped onto the stage and loudly recited a poem he had written himself:

"In the East, a golden red sun rises,
Its dazzling light illuminates the five continents.
The red sun is Chairman Mao,
Mao Zedong Thought colors the sky red,
Facing the sun, we sing loudly,
We sing "The East is Red" with all our hearts,
We sing it a thousand times, ten thousand times, and it is still not enough,
Long live, long live, Mao Zedong!
Let the song of 'The East is Red' spread across the five continents,
Let the song of 'The East is Red' echo in the universe.
Singing makes the five continents thunderous, singing makes the world red as fire,
The more we sing, the more we love Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts will never set."

Finally, he sang in Chinese, "The East is red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." and sang it twice.

A group of foreign children, all under five years old, performed a dance expressing the love of the world's people for Chairman Mao. Eight young people from different countries, dressed in neat military uniforms, sang "The PLA is a great school of revolution" and received enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. Finally, friends from more than seventy countries across the five continents sang together in different languages and with different instruments, "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China," and "Sailing the seas relies on the helmsman."

Taking the Spiritual Atom Bomb Back to Vietnam

Two friends from the war-torn south of Vietnam, carrying the deep affection of the Vietnamese people, came to our location. We enthusiastically welcomed our close comrades from the front lines of the anti-imperialist struggle with drums and gongs. In their speeches, they enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao and the thought of people's war. One friend said, "Although U.S. imperialism is ferocious, we, the people of South Vietnam, study Chairman Mao's great thought of people's war and fiercely strike down the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism, making the American aggressors suffer heavy losses and leaving their bodies scattered everywhere. This is the glorious achievement of the Vietnamese people." Saying this, he presented us with the wreckage of an American plane shot down by the Vietnamese people. The company commander shook his hand and presented him with a shining "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong." He joyfully jumped up, proudly saying, "Great! Great! My long-cherished wish has come true. I will take the most powerful spiritual atom bomb in the world back to Vietnam and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the people of South Vietnam. Now, U.S. imperialism is still killing and burning, and we will use Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics to annihilate U.S. imperialism in the vast sea of people's war."

The Greatest Joy

A Pakistani friend's room has a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the center, with the words "Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" written in shining gold letters below it. The walls of the room are covered with quotations from Chairman Mao and the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, "Study with problems in mind, apply actively, study and use together, study first what is urgently needed, and see results immediately." Every time we pass by, we see him deeply engrossed in studying the works of Chairman Mao, sometimes studying late into the night. One morning, while we were on duty, the Central People's Radio Station broadcasted that Chairman Mao's brilliant works were published in Pakistan. This Pakistani friend, holding a shining red book, happily ran over to us and said in Chinese, "Chairman Mao's brilliant works being published in Pakistan is a great and joyous event that inspires the heart. Chairman Mao is the greatest banner-bearer of the international communist movement. Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of revolution, the weapon of struggle, and the beacon of progress. Although imperialism regards Mao Zedong Thought as a flood and a beast, it blocks, curses, and slanders Mao Zedong Thought in every way, extremely shocked and terrified by the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and hysterically opposes it. However, the wings of crows cannot block the light of the sun. Mao Zedong Thought is flying over mountains and crossing oceans, spreading throughout the world. The revolutionary people of Pakistan love Chairman Mao without bounds. The revolutionary people of Pakistan deeply understand that only Mao Zedong Thought can transform the world. I live in the great era of Mao Zedong and must, like the PLA, insist on studying the works of Chairman Mao."

Red Propaganda Soldier of Mao Zedong Thought

An Indonesian child wears a PLA cap, dressed in a green military uniform, with a shining Chairman Mao badge on her chest. She wears a bright red Red Guard armband on her left arm, and her appearance is exactly like that of a Chinese Red Guard. Her original name is Ali, but last year, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to destroy the Four Olds, she changed her name to Xiangdong. This child can recite more than a hundred quotations from Chairman Mao and the full texts of the "Three Constantly Read Articles," has learned more than twenty songs from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and can perform many dances praising Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. She often enthusiastically propagates Mao Zedong Thought and performs for friends from the five continents, and foreign friends praise her as an international red propaganda soldier of Mao Zedong Thought.

Once, the hotel screened a large-scale color documentary "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts." On the screen, she saw Chairman Mao and was so moved that she had tears in her eyes, clapped with all her might, and raised her hands to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" The entire audience also shouted along. But she always felt that she could not express her boundless love for Chairman Mao. As soon as the movie finished, she jumped onto the stage and performed the dance "Long live Chairman Mao!" for the audience, receiving enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

"The shouts of 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!' shook the entire auditorium, stirring the hearts of everyone. Soldier of a certain unit of the PLA, Hu Rufu, Han Guoxing."

    毛主席啊！世界革命人民敬祝您万寿无疆！
    毛主席，您是全世界人民的伟大导师，您是世界革命人民胜利的象征，您是全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳。五洲四海把您歌唱，全世界人民把您颂扬。千言万语表达不了全世界人民对您的无限热爱，千歌万曲唱不完五大洲朋友对您的无限敬仰。挥天下之笔墨写不尽对您的无限崇拜，用五洲的语言也道不尽对您的无限忠诚。毛主席啊！世界革命人民敬祝您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！纵情高呼毛主席万岁！
    在宾馆的正厅，有一座大型的毛主席塑像，我们日日夜夜守卫在毛主席身旁。当东方红，太阳升，灿烂的曙光初现的时候，一位只会说三句中国话的法国朋友，走到毛主席的塑像前，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，用中国话高呼“毛主席万岁！打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”一天早晨他走到我们跟前，指着高大的毛主席塑像，抑制不住内心的激情，呼出了响亮的声音：“毛泽东，是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是法国人民和全世界人民的伟大领袖。毛泽东是当代的列宁，毛泽东是人类的希望，毛泽东是我们时代真理的曙光，全世界人民都向往着毛泽东，高歌颂扬毛泽东这光辉的名字。有了毛泽东，人民一定要解放，有了毛泽东，世界要象中国一样见到光明。”
    这位法国朋友又说：“苏联修正主义疯狂地反对毛主席，我们就是要高呼毛主席万岁！一辈子高呼毛主席万岁！让毛主席万岁的欢呼声传遍法国每一寸土地，传遍全世界每一个角落，让全世界共同高呼毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”天高，比不上毛主席威望高
    一天，我们手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，正向课堂走去，迎面走来一位胸前挂满了各式各样的毛主席像章的安哥拉朋友。他走到我们的跟前，突然停住了，他右手指着自己帽子正前方那枚最大的金光闪闪的毛主席像章，自豪地说：“我太幸福了！”过了一会，他咬着牙齿愤怒地说：“它们（指帝修反）禁止我们安哥拉人民佩戴毛主席像章，害怕我们人民掌握毛泽东思想，把我们戴毛主席像章说成是‘犯法’。有多少安哥拉兄弟渴望能够戴上一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章，他们认为这是最大的幸福，天大的喜事。今天我来到了红色的中国，世界革命的心脏——北京，我自由啦！我要代表安哥拉人民永远佩戴毛主席像章，让它放射出灿烂的光芒。毛主席是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命领袖，人家说天高，那比得上毛主席的威望高，我要把毛主席像章戴在胸前，人家说星多，那比得上毛主席对中国革命和世界革命的贡献多。我戴一千个、一万个毛主席像章也不嫌多！我们安哥拉人民永远向着毛主席，永远和毛主席心连心。”
      放声歌唱毛泽东
    一次五大洲朋友举行联欢晚会，邀请我们参加。我们一走进礼堂，全场掌声雷动，高呼毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！入座后，我们就高唱毛主席语录歌曲，外国朋友也随着唱了起来。虽说语言不同，但是我们表达了全世界人民对毛主席无限热爱，我们有着一个共同心愿，祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    在演出中，一位阿拉伯朋友登上舞台，高声朗诵他亲手写的一首诗：
    “东方的大地升起一轮金色的红太阳，
    光彩夺目的金光把五大洲照得通亮。
    红太阳就是毛主席，
    毛泽东思想映红天空，
    迎着太阳放声唱，
    纵情高歌东方红，
    千遍万遍唱不尽，
    万岁，万岁，毛泽东！
    让东方红的歌曲，传遍五洲四海，
    让东方红的歌声在宇宙回荡。
    唱得五洲起风雷，唱得全球红似火，
    越唱越爱毛主席，心中的红太阳永不
        落。”
    最后他用刚学会的中国语言放声歌唱“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”一连唱了两遍。
    一群平均不满五岁的外国小朋友，表演了世界人民热爱毛主席的舞蹈。八个国家的青年朋友，穿着整齐的军装，演唱了解放军是个革命的大学校，获得了全场的热烈鼓掌。最后五大洲七十多个国家的外国朋友，用不同的语言，不同的乐器，集体合唱了《领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党》、《大海航行靠舵手》。
  把精神原子弹带回越南去
    来自战火纷飞的越南南方两位朋友，满载越南人民的深情厚谊，来到了我们的驻地。我们敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎反帝斗争前线的亲密战友。他们在讲话中，热情歌颂了毛主席，歌颂了毛主席人民战争的思想。一位朋友说：“尽管美帝国主义穷凶极恶，我们越南南方人民学习毛主席伟大的人民战争思想，狠狠地打击了美帝国主义纸老虎，把美国强盗打得焦头烂额、尸体遍地，这就是越南人民的辉煌战果。”说着便把越南人民亲手击落的美国飞机残骸，赠送给我们，连长一把握住他的手，把光芒四射的《毛泽东军事文选》赠送给他，他接过宝书，高兴地跳了起来，骄傲地说：“太好啦！太好啦！我渴望以求的愿望实现了，我要把世界上威力最大的精神原子弹带回越南去，用毛泽东思想武装越南南方人民的头脑。现在美帝国主义还在杀人放火，我们要用毛主席的战略战术把美帝国主义消灭在人民战争的汪洋大海中”。
      天大的喜事
    一位巴基斯坦朋友的房子正中挂着毛主席的彩色画像，毛主席的像下面写着金光闪闪的大字：“毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”房子的四周贴满了毛主席语录和林副主席提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的指示。每天我们由这里经过时，总是看到他正在聚精会神地学习毛主席著作，有时学到深夜。一天的早晨，我们正在执勤任务。当中央人民广播电台广播了毛主席的光辉著作在巴基斯坦出版了，这位巴基斯坦朋友，手捧着金光闪闪的红书，高高兴兴向我们跑来，他用中国话对我们说：“毛主席光辉著作在巴基斯坦出版，是一件振奋人心的天大喜事。毛主席是国际共产主义运动最伟大旗手，毛泽东思想是革命的真理，战斗的武器，前进的灯塔。尽管帝国主义把毛泽东思想视为洪水猛兽，对毛泽东思想千方百计地封锁，咒骂，诽谤，对毛泽东思想的传播极为震惊，万分恐慌，歇斯底里地反对。但是，乌鸦的翅膀挡不住太阳的光辉，毛泽东思想正飞越高山，跨过海洋，传遍全世界。巴基斯坦革命人民无限热爱毛主席，巴基斯坦的革命人民深深懂得，只有毛泽东思想才能改造全世界。我生活在伟大的毛泽东时代，一定要象解放军一样，坚持学习毛主席著作。”
    毛泽东思想红色宣传员
    一个印尼小朋友，头戴解放军帽，身穿绿色军装，胸前的毛主席像章闪闪发光。她左手戴着鲜红的红卫兵袖章，看她的打扮和中国的红卫兵小将一模一样。她的原名叫阿利，去年红卫兵响应毛主席伟大号召破四旧的时候，她改名叫向东。这个小朋友会背一百多条毛主席语录和“老三篇”全文，学会了二十多首毛主席语录歌，会演许多歌颂毛主席和毛泽东思想的舞蹈。她经常为五大洲的外国朋友热情宣传毛泽东思想，表演节目，外国朋友称赞她是毛泽东思想的国际红色宣传员。
    一次，宾馆放映大型彩色纪录片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》，在银幕上她见到了毛主席，激动得热泪盈眶，用尽全身鼓掌，她举起双手振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”全场也随着高呼起来。但她总觉得表达不出她无限热爱毛主席的激动心情。电影刚放映完，她就跳上舞台，为观众表演了《万岁！毛主席》的舞蹈，受到全场观众的热烈欢迎。
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”口号震动了整个礼堂，激动着每一个人的心。解放军某部战士  胡如福  韩国兴
