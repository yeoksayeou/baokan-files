Our deputy commander, Comrade Lin Biao, conveyed the latest battle command from our great leader Chairman Mao at the grand celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: to fight self and criticize revisionism. This not only serves as the guiding principle for the continued advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China on the basis of its victories but also as the great blueprint for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the souls of the people. Its fundamental purpose is to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' ideology and to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that the socialist state remains unshakable for generations to come.

As early as 1945, on the eve of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao pointed out with great foresight: "If we do not carry out a thorough Marxist-Leninist educational movement, that is, a rectification movement, can we advance smoothly? Obviously, we cannot." Today, at this moment of great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao once again points out with great foresight: to fight self and criticize revisionism. If we do not carry out a thorough Marxist-Leninist educational movement under the banner of "fighting self and criticizing revisionism," and if we do not, in the struggle to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as their chief, bravely and consciously root out the "self" from our minds, we will not be able to draw a clear line between ourselves and the ideological system of the exploiting classes. We will not be able to uproot the poisonous roots of revisionism, and we will not be able to ensure that our socialist state remains unshakable for generations to come.

The ideological system of the exploiting classes has at its core the "self"; the ideological system of the proletariat has at its core the "public," the public of communism. To break with the "self" and establish the "public" means to wage a thorough ideological battle in our souls to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology and to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must thoroughly carry out the great criticism, the great alliance, the three-in-one combination, and the struggle-criticism-transformation in our units. We must, in the struggle, hold high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism raised by Chairman Mao, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and especially concentrate on the "application" part. We must constantly and thoroughly break with the "self" and establish the "public," making the bourgeois worldview of individualism stink and firmly planting the worldview of communism of the proletariat. We must uproot the obstacle to criticizing revisionism—the "self"—and firmly establish the great driving force of criticizing revisionism—the "public" of communism. We must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we, in the struggle, constantly strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, always advance along the course charted by Chairman Mao, and win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We are soldiers of Chairman Mao. We will do as Chairman Mao says. With full confidence in victory, we pledge to Chairman Mao: We will be thorough proletarian revolutionaries who break completely with "self," devote ourselves to the "public," and have a global revolutionary outlook. We will not be half-hearted revolutionaries, shortsighted, or mere flash-in-the-pan figures.

    斗私批修彻底革命
　　铁道兵机关无产阶级革命派
    我们的副统帅林彪同志在中华人民共和国成立十八周年的隆重庆典上，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新战斗号令：要斗私，批修。这不仅是当前我国无产阶级文化大革命在胜利基础上继续前进的指导方针，也是无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大纲领。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的伟大革命，它的根本目的，就是要大破资产阶级及一切剥削阶级的意识形态，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，保证社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
    毛主席早在一九四五年抗日战争胜利的前夕就曾英明地指出：“如果不进行一个普遍的马克思主义的教育运动，即整风运动，我们还能顺利地前进吗？显然是不能的。”今天，毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时刻又英明地指出：要斗私，批修。如果我们不进行一场以“斗私，批修”为纲的普遍的马克思主义的教育运动，不在彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，勇敢地、自觉地斗掉自己头脑里的“私”字，我们就不能同剥削阶级的思想体系划清界限，就不能把修正主义的毒根彻底拔掉，就不能保证我们的社会主义江山永不变色。
    剥削阶级的思想体系，它的核心就是一个“私”字；无产阶级的思想体系，核心就是一个“公”字，共产主义的“公”字。破“私”立“公”，就是要在我们灵魂深处打一场灭资兴无的思想仗，大破我们头脑中存在的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    我们无产阶级革命派在文化大革命中，要彻底搞好革命的大批判、革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”和本单位的斗批改，就要在斗争中高举毛主席的无产阶级革命的批判旗帜，努力活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫。要不断地、彻底地破“私”立“公”，把资产阶级个人主义的世界观搞得臭臭的，把无产阶级的共产主义世界观树得牢牢的。把批修的障碍——“私”字连根拔掉，把“斗私，批修”的伟大动力——共产主义的“公”字牢固地树立起来，把毛泽东思想的绝对权威牢固地树立起来。只有这样，我们才能在斗争中不断加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，始终沿着毛主席指引的航向前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    我们是毛主席的战士，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。我们满怀胜利信心地向伟大领袖毛主席保证：我们要做彻底同“私”字决裂、一心为“公”、胸怀世界革命的无产阶级革命派，决不做半截子革命、鼠目寸光、昙花一现的人物。
