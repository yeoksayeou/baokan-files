Wuhan, Oct. 9 (New China News Agency) — More than 100,000 revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers in Wuhan held a grand rally this afternoon to give the warmest and most enthusiastic welcome to the honorable envoys of the heroic Albanian people who stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle—the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania. Comrade Zhou Enlai, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, and other central leaders who accompanied the distinguished guests to Wuhan, as well as Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Liu Xiao, Luo Guibo, Wu Faxian, and other responsible comrades from various relevant departments of the Central Committee, attended the welcoming rally.

Responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, including Zhang Siyu, Liu Feng, Xu Guofu, and Zhang Yuhua, as well as responsible comrades of the Wuhan Military Region Air Force, including Xiao Qian, and responsible comrades of various revolutionary organizations in Wuhan, also attended the rally.

At 3:50 p.m., Comrade Shehu, Comrade Aliya, and the entire Albanian Party and Government delegation, accompanied by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuchun, and Comrade Liu Ningyi, ascended the platform. The entire audience erupted in cheers, and the applause was thunderous. The band played "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and the crowd shouted "Mao Zedong—Enver!" "Enver—Mao Zedong!" for a long time. Comrade Shehu and Comrade Aliya waved repeatedly to the cheering crowd. The entire venue was filled with the revolutionary friendship between the two countries, and the atmosphere was filled with the fervent spirit of proletarian internationalism.

At the beginning of the rally, the entire audience read aloud the quotations of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Zhang Siyu first delivered a welcome speech at the rally. On behalf of the Wuhan Military Region and the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, he expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Shehu and extended revolutionary greetings to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Zhou Enlai spoke amid thunderous applause. He first announced the biggest piece of good news: Comrade Shehu, Comrade Aliya, and the entire Albanian Party and Government delegation were invited by our great leader Chairman Mao to visit Wuhan. Chairman Mao invited them to personally see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. Comrade Shehu and Comrade Aliya also wanted to see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution here.

The news spread, and the entire audience was excited, immediately bursting into thunderous applause. The enthusiastic slogan "Long live Chairman Mao!" resonated through the sky for a long time.

Comrade Zhou Enlai continued, "Wuhan is a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. Our great leader Chairman Mao has often sailed against the wind and waves here, crossing the Yangtze River. The revolutionary masses of Wuhan have always followed Chairman Mao's lead, advancing through storms and waves. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have undergone new tests. Today, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan are holding a grand rally to welcome the Albanian comrades from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. We feel particularly close and extremely excited."

Comrade Zhou Enlai said: In his message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, Chairman Mao Zedong highly praised: "Heroic Albania, a beacon of socialism in Europe. The Soviet revisionist leadership, the Yugoslav Tito clique, and all kinds of traitors and scoundrels are nothing but a handful of dust compared to you, while you are a towering mountain." The Chinese people are deeply proud to have such a great ally as Albania.

Comrade Zhou Enlai warmly praised the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, for consistently holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. For the defense and development of Marxism-Leninism and for the world revolutionary cause, they have made great contributions.

Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out: The Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, adheres to the revolutionary line of seizing power by armed struggle. In the class struggle at home and abroad, they rely on the broad masses, continuously develop and strengthen the people's armed forces, and defend the fruits of the revolution. When some big and small "parliamentarians" in Europe were preparing to surrender their guns and lay down their arms to seek a position in the post-war bourgeois government, the Albanian Labor Party led the Albanian people to firmly grasp the gun, rely on their own strength to liberate their country, and support the anti-fascist struggle of the Greek and Yugoslav peoples.

Comrade Zhou Enlai strongly condemned the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries for their various attempts to subvert and invade Albania. He fully supported Comrade Hoxha's stern warning to the American imperialists, the Soviet revisionist group, and the Greek royalist fascists at the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front in September, pointing out that if they dared to venture into Albania, they would face severe punishment. He said: We fully support Comrade Hoxha's solemn stance on behalf of the Albanian people. We believe that the heroic Albanian people, with their rich tradition of armed struggle, maintain high revolutionary vigilance, are full of fighting spirit, and are invincible.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said: The Albanian people are not isolated. All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world stand with Albania. Albania's friends are everywhere. Although China and Albania are thousands of miles apart, our two parties and peoples are always fighting shoulder to shoulder. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries must count China and Albania together.

Comrade Zhou Enlai emphasized that ending the aggression and oppression of American imperialism is a common task for all the people of the world.

Comrade Zhou Enlai continued, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. The revolutionary situation across the country is excellent. The situation in the Wuhan area is also excellent, just like the rest of the country.

Now, the most important task facing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the country is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, carry out a thorough criticism, achieve great unity, and implement the three-in-one combination. We must criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own units. This task is very heavy. Especially the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units can be said to have not yet begun. To complete these tasks and achieve great unity is a very important key.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve great unity on the basis of revolution. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve great unity on the basis of revolution." After a period of fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the Wuhan area has clarified the major issues, isolated the bad elements, and disintegrated the conservative organizations. Thus, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the revolutionary mass organizations have the conditions to achieve great unity. We hope you will continue to work hard, overcome various obstacles on the road ahead, and achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought with "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline. To promote great unity, various revolutionary mass organizations should seriously study the works of Chairman Mao and the highest directives, open the door to rectification, make more self-criticisms, see more of others' strengths, learn from each other, complement each other's weaknesses, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. If there are people in various revolutionary mass organizations who disrupt great unity on the basis of revolutionary principles, they should be exposed and dealt with by the revolutionary masses of that organization. Other organizations should not go after them. The stationed forces and leading organs of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan area should do more ideological and political work to help and promote the realization of great unity among the mass organizations.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the development of socialist construction in our country. The revolutionization of people's ideology will inevitably be transformed into a great material force. We believe that after this cultural revolution, the socialist construction in our country will surely usher in a new leap of development. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call and resolutely implement the strategic policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Every revolutionary mass organization should be tested in production. We believe that the broad revolutionary workers and commune members in the Wuhan area will do this and will surely be able to do it.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, this cultural revolution is a comprehensive examination and severe test for cadres at all levels. He said, most of our cadres are good or relatively good. Even if they have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, most of them can be educated to change. As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialism and insist on not changing, we will allow them to make amends for their mistakes, redeem themselves with merits, and should be helped and educated according to the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to recognize and correct their mistakes, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We believe that after the criticism and help of the masses, a large number of cadres should and can be liberated.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, our great leader Chairman Mao, in the face of the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, issued the great battle call of "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism." This is the basic guideline for guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview. "Selfishness" is the core of the bourgeois worldview and the ideological source of the survival and development of revisionism. Only by thoroughly eliminating "selfishness" from one's mind can one uproot the roots of revisionism, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and better carry the anti-revisionist struggle to the end. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to fight against "selfishness" in our minds and fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and turn the whole country into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhou Enlai enthusiastically praised the revolutionary and fighting friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, which have gone through storms and trials. Now, the Albanian comrades are also firmly supporting and enthusiastically praising our great cultural revolution. Comrade Enver Hoxha recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only of great significance to China but also to all revolutionary factions and the international communist and workers' movement around the world." This is a high evaluation of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the people of the whole country.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, expressed his gratitude to the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian government, and the people for their consistent and enthusiastic support of proletarian internationalism.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, our great leader Chairman Mao said: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite more closely with the heroic Albanian brothers, unite with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, and carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end, carry the struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist leadership to the end, and carry the struggle against reactionaries of all countries to the end!

Comrade Shehu spoke amid extremely enthusiastic applause. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao for inviting their delegation to visit Wuhan. He enthusiastically praised the people of Wuhan, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, for making outstanding contributions in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies. The leftist revolutionary forces loyal to the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his revolutionary line, exposed and smashed the enemies' plots to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashed the capitalist reactionary line of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, bravely defended Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist line, and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revolutionary workers of Wuhan, together with revolutionary students and the People's Liberation Army, supported and inspired each other, united closely, fought together, and won together. Thus, they wrote a great victory for the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao in their glorious history.

He then enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as an event of world-historical significance. He stressed that when imperialism, revisionism, and world reactionaries are frantically attacking China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Comrade Mao Zedong, it is the international duty of all Marxist-Leninists, revolutionaries, and the people of the world to spare no effort to support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Shehu pointed out: Comrade Mao Zedong is a great Marxist-Leninist who closely combines the practice of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, as well as the development of the international communist and revolutionary movement, past and present, to defend and further develop Marxism-Leninism and has made outstanding contributions.

Comrade Shehu emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a revolution carried out according to the revolutionary theory and thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people.

The historic resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China further promoted the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The essence of the resolution of the plenary session is reflected in Comrade Mao Zedong's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters." At the crucial moment of the fierce struggle between the socialist and capitalist lines, this big-character poster expresses the revolutionary masses' deep hatred for the class enemies, who are trying to strangle the revolutionary cause, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and establish bourgeois dictatorship in China. Wherever we go, we see with our own eyes: China's economy has achieved great successes in all fields, labor is disciplined and organized, and the revolutionary optimism and high spirits of hundreds of millions of people prove once again that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing to victory and is bringing new victories to all fields in China.

He stressed that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shows that the Communist Party of China has an invincible power, that the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has an invincible power, and that the creators of history—the people—have boundless power.

Comrade Shehu emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great example for the communists and people of the countries ruled by the revisionist clique to rise up in revolution, overthrow the revisionist clique, re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and return to the socialist road; it inspires the true communists within the communist and workers' parties that have been usurped by revisionists and traitors to rise up and overthrow the revisionist traitor leadership, so that their parties can return to the true path of Marxism-Leninism; it greatly inspires the oppressed peoples of the world to rise up and fight for freedom from imperialist oppression; it inspires and greatly promotes the international working class to revolt against capitalist and bourgeois oppression.

Comrade Shehu emphasized that no matter what tricks the Khrushchev revisionists play, no force in the world can stop the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China from advancing to victory. This victory is certain and inevitable.

He expressed that the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian Party members, and all the people have always been clear and firm in their support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, condemning the bourgeois revisionist plots of the Chinese Khrushchev, supporting Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and ensuring that People's China remains forever red and forever a strong bastion of world revolution and socialism, advancing bravely.

Comrade Shehu then spoke about the great victories achieved by the Albanian people under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, in implementing the decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Party, implementing the ideological guidance of Comrade Hoxha's programmatic speech on February 6 this year, and implementing all important measures taken by the Party and the government to further revolutionize national life. In elaborating on the great significance of the socialist revolution on the ideological front, he pointed out that the bitter lessons of the Soviet Union and other revisionist ruling countries show that without achieving a thorough victory on the ideological front, the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and economic fronts is not guaranteed.

He said, our laboring masses, following the Party's guidance, implement the slogan of "thinking, working, and living like revolutionaries," and engage in the great struggle on the ideological front, further establish communist ideology and worldview, and realize that further deepening the ideological revolution, constantly opposing bourgeois and revisionist ideas, opposing the backward habits and religious superstitions left by the exploiting classes, is, for a long time to come, a primary task for our people living, working, and struggling under the conditions of being geographically surrounded by imperialist-revisionists. A series of revolutionary movements and initiatives with profound ideological, political, economic, and social content have been carried out among the laboring masses in our country. These many revolutionary movements show that our laboring masses strongly support the Party's revolutionary line, ensuring that Albania will never change its revolutionary color and will always advance on the socialist road and march towards communism.

Comrade Shehu analyzed the current excellent international situation. He strongly condemned the Johnson administration and the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique for conducting dirty deals behind the heroic Vietnamese people, trying to force the Vietnamese people to surrender to the feet of the American invaders through the "peace talks" trick. He pointed out: The main target of the global strategy of US-Soviet cooperation is to oppose the great People's China led by Mao Zedong, because China, which is undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become a strong bastion of socialism and world revolution. However, the imperialist and revisionist anti-China and anti-socialist revolutionary plots will surely fail. Imperialism and modern revisionism will surely die, and socialist and communist revolutions will surely win worldwide.

Comrade Shehu emphasized: The Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the Albanian government are proud to have the great Chinese people and the heroic Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong as their friends who share life and death. Dear comrades, we assure you: The Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party will forever be your comrades and loyal allies. We will forever march shoulder to shoulder with the great Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong and the great Chinese Communist Party to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, and strive for the complete victory of the socialist and communist cause in our two countries and the world!

The speeches of Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Shehu repeatedly triggered waves of enthusiastic applause and cheers. At the end of the rally, Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Shehu, Comrade Aliya warmly embraced, vividly embodying the fighting friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania. Comrade Zhang Siyu, on behalf of the Wuhan Military Region and the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, presented Comrade Shehu with a badge of Chairman Mao and a banner with the words "Within the sea, there are friends; across the distant horizon, we are neighbors. The hearts of the two countries, China and Albania, are connected." Comrade Shehu, on behalf of the Albanian Party and Government delegation, also presented a banner to the rally.

The welcoming rally ended with the solemn music of the "Internationale."

    毛主席邀请阿尔巴尼亚同志访问武汉十万军民最隆重地欢迎最亲密的战友
    周恩来同志谢胡同志发表重要讲话。康生、李富春、刘宁一等同志出席了大会
    新华社武汉九日电　武汉地区无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军武汉部队广大指战员十万多人，今天下午举行盛大集会，最热烈最隆重地欢迎站在反帝反修斗争前哨的英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣使者——由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团。中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，和陪同贵宾前来武汉访问的中央负责同志以及中央各有关方面负责人康生、李富春、刘宁一、刘晓、罗贵波、吴法宪等出席了欢迎大会。
    中国人民解放军武汉部队负责人曾思玉、刘丰、徐国夫、张玉华，武汉部队空军负责人萧前以及武汉地区各革命组织的负责人也出席了大会。
    下午三时五十分，谢胡同志、阿利雅同志以及阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，由周恩来同志、康生同志、李富春同志、刘宁一同志等陪同，走上主席台，这时，全场欢腾，掌声雷动，乐队高奏《大海航行靠舵手》，人们长时间地高呼“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”！谢胡同志、阿利雅同志频频招手，向全场欢迎的群众热烈致意。整个会场上充满了中阿两国人民的革命友谊，洋溢着无产阶级国际主义的炽热气氛。
    大会开始的时候，全场齐声朗读了毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志语录。
    曾思玉同志首先在大会上致欢迎词。他代表武汉部队和武汉地区无产阶级革命派，向以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团表示最衷心的感谢，并致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼。
    周恩来同志在暴风雨般的掌声中讲话，他首先告诉大家一个最大的喜讯：谢胡同志、阿利雅同志和阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的全体同志，这次是应我们的伟大领袖毛主席的专门邀请来到武汉的。毛主席请他们亲自来看看武汉的无产阶级文化大革命运动。谢胡同志、阿利雅同志，他们也很想来看看这里的无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    喜讯传出，全场振奋，立刻响起暴风雨般的掌声，“毛主席万岁”的热烈口号声长时间响彻云霄。
    周恩来同志接着说，武汉，是具有光荣革命传统的城市。我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经多次在这里乘风破浪，畅游长江。武汉的无产阶级革命派，一直是跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进的。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，你们又经受了新的考验。今天，武汉的无产阶级革命派在这里举行盛大集会，欢迎来自反帝反修斗争前线的阿尔巴尼亚战友，我们感到分外亲切，无比兴奋。
    周恩来同志说：毛泽东主席在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中高度赞扬说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。”中国人民以有阿尔巴尼亚这样伟大的战友，而深深地感到自豪。
    周恩来同志热烈赞扬以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，一贯高举马克思列宁主义伟大红旗，坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。为捍卫和发展马克思列宁主义，为世界革命事业作出了伟大的贡献。
    周恩来同志指出：以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，坚持武装夺取政权的革命路线，在国内外阶级斗争中，依靠广大群众，不断发展和壮大人民武装力量，保卫革命胜利的果实。当欧洲一些大大小小的“议会迷”，为了在战后资产阶级政府中求得一官半职而准备向敌人交枪投降的时候，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导阿尔巴尼亚人民，毫不动摇地紧握枪杆子，依靠自己的力量解放了祖国，并且支援了希腊和南斯拉夫人民的反法西斯斗争。
    周恩来同志强烈谴责帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派千方百计地企图颠覆和侵占阿尔巴尼亚。他完全支持霍查同志在九月召开的民主阵线第四次代表大会上对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义集团和希腊保皇法西斯分子提出的严厉警告，指出如果他们胆敢冒险闯进阿尔巴尼亚，他们将遭到严厉的惩罚。他说：我们完全支持霍查同志代表阿尔巴尼亚人民所表示的这一严正立场。我们相信，富有武装斗争传统的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，保持着高度的革命警惕性，充满着旺盛的战斗精神，是不可战胜的。
    周恩来同志说：阿尔巴尼亚人民决不是孤立的。全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民都站在阿尔巴尼亚一边，阿尔巴尼亚的朋友遍天下。中阿两国虽然远隔万里，但是，我们两党和两国人民是永远并肩战斗的，帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派必须把中阿两国计算在一起。
    周恩来同志强调说，结束美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的共同任务。
    周恩来同志接着说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。全国革命形势一片大好。武汉地区也同全国一样，形势大好。
    现在，摆在全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众面前最重要的任务，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，搞好革命的大批判，实现革命的大联合和三结合。把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批倒、批臭，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，这方面的任务是十分繁重的。特别是各单位的斗、批、改，可以说基本上还没有开始。而要胜利完成这些任务，实现革命的大联合是很重要的关键。
    周恩来同志说，毛主席教导我们说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合，只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”武汉地区经过前一段时期两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的严重斗争，大是大非分清了，坏人孤立了，保守组织瓦解了。这样，无产阶级革命派和革命群众组织就具备了实现革命大联合的条件。希望你们继续努力，克服前进道路上的种种障碍，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上以“斗私，批修”为纲，更好、更快地实现革命的大联合和三结合。为了促进革命的大联合，各革命群众组织应该认真学习毛主席著作和最高指示，开门整风，多作自我批评，多看别人的优点，互相学习，取长补短，加强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性。各革命群众组织中如有人破坏在革命原则基础上的大联合，要靠那个组织的革命群众自己揭发处理，别的组织不要去揪斗。武汉地区的人民解放军驻军和领导机关，应该多做思想政治工作，帮助和促进各群众组织实现大联合。
    周恩来同志说，无产阶级文化大革命，推动了我国社会主义建设事业的发展。人的思想的革命化，势必转化为巨大的物质力量。我们相信，经过这场文化大革命，我国的社会主义建设事业必将出现一个新的飞跃发展的高潮。我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的战略方针。每一个革命群众组织都要在生产中经受考验。我们相信，武汉地区的广大革命职工和公社社员一定会这样做的，而且也一定能够做到的。
    周恩来同志说，这一次文化大革命，对于各级干部来说，是一场全面的审查和严峻的考验。他说，我们的干部绝大多数是好的或者比较好的。即使犯有错误，甚至犯有严重错误，多数也是可以教育过来的。只要不是反党反社会主义而又坚持不改、屡教不改的，我们都要容许他们将功补过，带罪立功，都应该按照团结——批评和自我批评——团结的公式，帮助和教育他们认识错误，改正错误，使他们重新回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们相信，经过群众的批评和帮助，是应该而且也可以解放一大批干部的。
    周恩来同志说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的形势下，向我们发出了“斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号令。这是指导无产阶级文化大革命的基本纲领。无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的，就是要大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观。“私”字是资产阶级世界观的核心，是修正主义生存和发展的思想根源。只有从头脑中彻底铲除“私”字，才能挖掉修正主义的根子，才能树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。我们一定要按照毛主席的最新指示，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争，把全国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    周恩来同志热情称颂经历过急风暴雨的严峻考验的中阿两党、两国、两国人民之间的革命战斗友谊。现在，阿尔巴尼亚的战友们又坚决地支持和热情地赞扬我国这场伟大的文化大革命运动。恩维尔·霍查同志最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界一切革命派以及国际共产主义和工人运动都具有十分重大的意义。”这是对我国无产阶级文化大革命的高度评价，这是对我国无产阶级革命派和全国人民的极大鼓舞。
    周恩来同志代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民感谢阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民一贯给予我们最坚决、最热情的无产阶级国际主义的支援。
    周恩来同志说，我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”我们一定按照毛主席的教导，更加紧密地同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟团结起来，同全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民团结起来，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把反对各国反动派的斗争进行到底！
    谢胡同志在极其热烈的掌声中讲话。他表示衷心感谢毛主席邀请他们代表团访问武汉。他热情赞扬武汉人民在中国共产党领导下，在反对国内外敌人中，作出了杰出的贡献。忠于中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志及其革命路线的武汉左派革命力量，揭露和粉碎了党和人民的敌人企图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级反动路线，勇敢地捍卫了毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义路线，加强了无产阶级专政。武汉革命工人同革命学生和人民解放军互相支持、互相鼓舞，紧密团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。这样他们在自己的光荣历史上写下了以毛主席为代表的革命路线的伟大胜利。
    接着，他以巨大的热情赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命是一个具有世界历史意义的事件。他强调说：当帝国主义、修正主义和世界反动派正在疯狂地攻击中国、攻击无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东同志的时候，一切马克思列宁主义者，一切革命者和世界人民的国际义务就是竭尽全力支援中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    谢胡同志指出：毛泽东同志是一位伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他紧密地结合中国革命和中国社会主义建设以及国际共产主义和革命运动发展的实践，过去和现在为保卫和进一步发展马克思列宁主义作出了杰出的贡献。
    谢胡同志强调说：中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场按照中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的革命学说和思想进行的革命。
    中共八届十一中全会具有历史意义的决议，进一步促进了无产阶级文化大革命的开展。全会的决议实质，体现在毛泽东同志的《炮打司令部》的大字报中。在社会主义和资本主义两条路线残酷斗争的关键时刻发表的这张大字报，表现了革命群众对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，就是这些敌人妄图扼杀革命事业，推翻无产阶级专政，在中国建立资产阶级专政。我们所到之处亲眼看到：中国经济在各个领域都获得巨大成就，劳动有纪律、有组织，亿万人民群众的革命乐观情绪和意气风发，这一切再一次证明，无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利前进，同时给中国各个领域带来新的胜利。
    他强调指出：中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，表明中国共产党有无比强大的力量，表明马克思列宁主义的不朽学说和毛泽东思想有无比强大的力量，表明历史的创造者——人民群众具有无穷无尽的力量。
    谢胡同志强调说，无产阶级文化大革命是修正主义集团统治的国家的共产党人和人民的伟大榜样，它告诉他们如何起来革命，推翻修正主义集团，重新建立无产阶级专政，重新回到社会主义的道路上来；它鼓舞着被修正主义和叛徒篡夺了领导权的共产党和工人党内的真正的共产党人，告诉他们如何起来推翻修正主义的叛徒领导，使他们的党重新走上真正的马克思列宁主义的道路；它大大地鼓舞全世界被压迫人民起来，从帝国主义的压迫下争取自由；它鼓舞并大大地促进国际工人阶级反对资本主义和资产阶级压迫的革命。
    谢胡强调说，不管赫鲁晓夫修正主义者搞什么名堂，世界上没有任何力量能阻挡中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。这个胜利是肯定的，是必然的。
    他表示，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，阿尔巴尼亚党员和全体人民的态度过去和现在一直是明确和坚定地支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，谴责中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级修正主义阴谋，支持毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线，使人民中国永远鲜红，永远做为世界革命和社会主义的强大堡垒，奋勇前进。
    谢胡同志接着谈到了阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”，贯彻执行党的第五次代表大会决议，贯彻执行霍查同志今年二月六日纲领性讲话的思想，以及贯彻执行党和政府为使国家生活进一步革命化所采取的一切重要措施所取得的巨大胜利。他在着重阐述思想战线上社会主义革命的巨大意义时指出，苏联以及其它修正主义当权国家的惨痛教训表明，思想战线上的社会主义革命不取得彻底胜利，政治和经济战线上的社会主义革命胜利就没有保证。
    他说，我国劳动群众遵循党的这些教导，执行“象革命者一样思考、工作和生活”的口号，投入到思想战线上的巨大斗争中去，进一步树立共产主义思想和世界观，并意识到进一步深入开展思想革命，不断反对资产阶级和修正主义思想，反对剥削阶级遗留下来的落后习惯和宗教迷信，对于在地理上被帝修包围条件下生活、工作和斗争的我国人民来说，在很长时期内仍将是一项首要任务。在我国劳动群众中实现了一系列具有深刻的思想、政治、经济和社会内容的革命运动和倡议。这许多革命运动表明，我国劳动群众有力地拥护党的革命路线，以保证阿尔巴尼亚永远不改变革命的颜色，永远在社会主义道路上前进，并奔向共产主义。
    谢胡同志分析了当前一片大好的国际形势。他强烈谴责约翰逊政府和勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团，背着英雄的越南人民，正在进行肮脏的勾当和交易，企图通过“和谈”诡计，迫使越南人民屈服于美帝侵略者的脚下。他指出：美苏合作的全球战略的主要矛头是反对毛泽东的伟大的人民中国，因为正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国已成为社会主义和世界革命的强大堡垒。但是，帝国主义、修正主义反华、反对社会主义革命的罪恶计划，必将彻底失败。帝国主义和现代修正主义一定死亡，社会主义和共产主义革命必将在全世界胜利。
    谢胡同志强调说：阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府，为有伟大的中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的英雄的中国共产党作为自己生死与共的朋友和忠实的战友感到骄傲。亲爱的同志们，我们向你们保证：阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将永远是你们的战友和忠实的盟国。我们将永远同毛泽东同志的伟大的中国人民和伟大的中国共产党在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派，争取社会主义和共产主义事业在我们两国和全世界的彻底胜利而并肩前进！
    周恩来同志和谢胡同志的讲话，不断激起一阵阵热烈的掌声和欢呼声。大会最后，周恩来同志和谢胡同志、阿利雅同志热烈拥抱，生动地体现了中阿两党、两国人民的战斗友谊。曾思玉同志代表武汉部队和武汉地区无产阶级革命派向阿尔巴尼亚战友赠送了毛主席像章，和书写着“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的”字样的锦旗。谢胡同志代表阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团也向大会赠送了锦旗。
    欢迎大会在庄严的《国际歌》乐曲声中结束。
