On October 1st at noon, we returned to our company with hearts filled with boundless excitement and joy to report to all our comrades the thrilling, unforgettable, and most joyous news: we saw Chairman Mao, whom we have been longing for day and night! His health is extremely good! As the news spread, drums and gongs resounded, and the camp was filled with jubilation. "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The shouts echoed through the camp. Then, we conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions: to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Everyone raised the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," solemnly vowing: We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, and pledge to be the vanguard in fighting selfishness and the pioneers in criticizing revisionism!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Vice Chairman Lin pointed out in his National Day speech: "Fighting selfishness is to struggle against the 'self' in one's mind with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Criticizing revisionism is to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and to struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." The "self" is the root of revisionism, and revisionism is the malignant growth of the "self." To better "criticize revisionism," we must thoroughly "fight selfishness." Only by eliminating the "self" can we carry the anti-revisionist struggle to the end and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds.

The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism in China, vigorously advocates the "theory of public ownership with private benefits," "theory of public and private fusion," and "theory of the legality of selfishness," and spreads a set of revisionist goods such as "struggling for the individual," "suffering small losses to gain big advantages." Pfft! Chinese Khrushchev! The "people's war" of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" has begun, and your beautiful dreams are completely shattered!

Chairman Mao said: "Communism is the whole ideological system of the proletariat, and at the same time, it is a new social system. ... Only the ideological system and social system of communism are surging forward with the force of a mountain collapse and the power of thunder, covering the whole world, and preserving its wonderful youth." Mao Zedong Thought is the ideological system of communism. Without destruction, there can be no construction; without stopping, there can be no progress. "Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought and the ideological system of communism, to defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to let the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought surge forward and preserve its wonderful youth. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as our guideline, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, turn the sky into a sky under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, turn the earth into an earth bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, turn people into people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and turn our army into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Open your eyes to the future and march forward with unwavering determination! Follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao and carry the revolution through to the end.

    在“斗私，批修”战场上当闯将
　　首都警卫部队某连　孔祥秀　李国丙
    十月一日中午，我们怀着无限激动、无限喜悦的心情回到连队，向全连同志报告了振奋人心、终身难忘的最最幸福的特大喜讯：我们见到了日夜想念的毛主席！他老人家身体非常非常健康！喜讯一传开，锣鼓喧天，一片欢腾。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”的口号声响彻军营。接着，我们传达了毛主席的最新指示：要斗私，批修。大家高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，庄严地宣誓：坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，誓做斗私的先锋，批修的闯将！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”林副主席在庆祝国庆讲话中指出：“斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的‘私’字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。”“私”字是产生修正主义的根子，修正主义是“私”字的恶性发展的产物。要更好地“批修”，必须很好地“斗私”。只有斗掉了“私”字，才能把反修斗争进行到底，才能在头脑里树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了在中国复辟资本主义，拚命地鼓吹“大公有私论”、
  “公私溶化论”、“私字合法论”，竭力散布“为个人奋斗”，“吃小亏，占大便宜”的一套修正主义货色。呸！中国的赫鲁晓夫！一场“斗私，批修”的“人民战争”打响了，你们的黄粱美梦彻底破产了！
    毛主席说：“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。……惟独共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”毛泽东思想就是共产主义的思想体系。不破不立，不止不行。“斗私，批修”就是要大立毛泽东思想，大立共产主义的思想体系，捍卫和巩固无产阶级专政，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以毛泽东思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，把天变成毛泽东思想统帅的天，把地变成毛泽东思想阳光普照的地，把人变成用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，把我军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进！跟着伟大舵手毛主席，革命到底。
