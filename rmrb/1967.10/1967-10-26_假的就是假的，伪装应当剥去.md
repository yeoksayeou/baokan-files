More than a century ago, there was a so-called "clever" clown in Germany named Hermann Semmler, who naively and innocently "created" a ridiculous theory: "Communism and socialism ultimately dissolve into humanitarianism."

At that time, Marx and Engels in their brilliant work "The German Ideology" had severely criticized and thoroughly refuted this fallacy. This clearly tells us: humanitarianism cannot replace scientific communism, and scientific communism cannot dissolve into humanitarianism.

However, the Soviet revisionist traitors, disregarding Marx and Engels' criticism of Semmler, have shamelessly followed in his footsteps, loudly proclaiming: "Communism is humanitarianism." This is indeed a reactionary fallacy to the extreme. If this is the case, what fundamental difference is there between scientific communism and capitalism? What fundamental difference is there between the proletarian revolution and the bourgeois revolution of the Enlightenment period, which was carried out under the banner of "humanitarianism"?

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hold that a communist society is one where classes and class distinctions have been completely eliminated, where all people have a high level of communist consciousness and moral character, where all people have a high level of labor enthusiasm and self-awareness, where there are extremely abundant social products, where the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is implemented, and where the state has withered away.

Clearly, the Soviet revisionist traitors, who have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have castrated and distorted the revolutionary content and spiritual essence of scientific communism. They take what the bourgeoisie can accept—"humanitarianism"—and discard, eliminate, and conceal what the bourgeoisie cannot accept—the elimination of classes. They do this to deny class struggle and class existence within the Soviet Union using "humanitarianism," to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat using "humanitarianism," and to cover up their ugly faces of selling fake communism and fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union using "humanitarianism."

Lenin, in his essay "On the Parties of Russia," sharply pointed out: "All bourgeois parties, that is, parties that protect the economic privileges of the capitalists, extol their own party just as capitalists extol their own goods. Just look at any newspaper's commercial advertisements, and you will see that capitalists think up the most 'appealing,' the most resounding, the most fashionable names for their goods, shamelessly lying and fabricating to the utmost to praise the excellence of their goods."

The Soviet revisionist traitors are no different! Over the past decade, they have played all sorts of tricks to sell their fake communist goods. Sometimes they describe their "communism" as a "delicious dish of mashed potatoes and roast beef"; sometimes they dress up their "communism" as "Western shoes and overcoats"; and now, they depict their "communism" as a drop of crocodile tears, saying that communism is "humanitarianism." They are so shameless, fabricating lies and brazenly praising their fake communist goods.

But, no matter how they change, the essence remains the same. "The fake must be exposed, the disguise must be stripped away."

Lenin pointed out, "The development toward communism must go through the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot take any other path." However, the Soviet revisionist traitors, who have betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, have implemented bourgeois dictatorship and fascist dictatorship in the Soviet Union, causing the Soviet Union to regress to capitalism and changing the color of the Soviet Union.

Today, in the Soviet Union fifty years after the October Revolution, under the patronage of the Soviet revisionist traitors, capitalist forces are rampant, and new bourgeois elements are sprouting up, forming a bourgeois privileged class. The Soviet working people have once again become slaves of the new exploiting class. Class differences are becoming more pronounced, and polarization is becoming more evident. A Moscow university student angrily said: "The Soviet Union is now a capitalist country. High-salaried people live better than Western capitalists, and the entire country's factories and enterprises are in their hands, while ordinary people live in poverty, even worse than in the tsarist era."

Today, in the Soviet Union fifty years after the October Revolution, the Soviet revisionist traitors are vigorously selling revisionist and capitalist goods. They open the floodgates for bourgeois ideology to spread; they give the green light to the decayed culture of the West, allowing it to permeate everywhere. American bourgeois newspapers joyfully wrote: "Unlike the attitude of the Stalin era, certain Western things have 'entered' Russia in various aspects these days." As a result, traitors receive bonuses, criminals are pardoned, and swindlers win applause. The philosophy of survival spreads, profit is above all; money can buy anything, "each sweeps in front of their own door." It is a scene of chaos!

Today, in the Soviet Union fifty years after the October Revolution, there is no talk of developing towards extremely abundant social products, but rather economic decline and severe shortages of goods. At the same time, today's Soviet Union also has no talk of developing towards "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," but rather the laborers do not gain, and the gainers do not labor. The bourgeois privileged class massively plunders the fruits of the Soviet people's labor, and the rich and poor are increasingly polarized. Listen, an old worker with thirty years of service angrily said: "We have many millionaires here. We workers count our money in kopeks, even when eating we have to calculate whether to spend an extra kopek, but these people don't care about rubles at all."

It is clear that the Soviet revisionist traitors shout that communism is "humanitarianism" precisely to cover up the fake communist goods they sell. Their so-called "communism" is the embodiment of capitalism. Such "communism" is a paradise for new and old bourgeois elements, and a hell for the broad masses of working people. To call such "communism" "humanitarian" can only be humanitarian for the new and old bourgeoisie, and for the broad masses of working people, it is exploitation and oppression. That's all, nothing more!

Over the past decade, Khrushchev and his successors, under the banner of "communism is humanitarianism," have done countless inhuman and heinous deeds. They used this banner to deceive the Soviet people and cover up the restoration of capitalism. They used this banner to deceive the international proletariat and the people of the world, betraying proletarian internationalism. Under the cover of this banner, they colluded with American imperialism to carry out "joint actions," suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and implement neo-colonialist policies. Under the cover of this banner, they committed evil deeds of false aid and true plunder, false support and true betrayal against the oppressed peoples and the peoples being invaded.

The history of class struggle and reality tell us that the bourgeoisie initially used the hypocritical banner of "humanitarianism" to overthrow the feudal autocratic system and establish the capitalist system; later, they turned this banner into an even more hypocritical and deceitful reactionary slogan to maintain the capitalist system and engage in all reactionary activities. Modern revisionism also uses this reactionary slogan to deny Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, distort scientific communism, transform socialism, and restore capitalism, engaging in all reactionary activities. Is this not exactly what the modern Soviet revisionists have done! However, no matter how they change, history will make a fair judgment on them. As Engels said in his essay "The Foreign Policy of the Russian Tsarist Government," "'The historical joke' will make an unyielding correction to them."

History has proven that whoever tries to strangle socialism, whoever fiercely opposes communism, will ultimately be crushed by the wheels of history and meet a miserable end. There is no force in the world that can stop scientific communism from "rolling across the world and preserving its beautiful youth."

Chairman Mao said: "The banner of the October Revolution is invincible."

Although Leninism's homeland has temporarily been usurped by the Soviet revisionist clique, we firmly believe that the true Soviet communists and the great Soviet people, who have been tempered and tested by the October Revolution and the Great Patriotic War, will never be willing to be slaves. They will surely see through the true face of fake communism, raise the banner of the October Revolution again, inherit the will of Lenin and Stalin, break the chains on their bodies, cut off all the nets that bind them, and overthrow the Soviet revisionist traitors who ride on their heads and act tyrannically, letting the red star of the Kremlin shine with even more brilliant light.

Long live Leninism!
Long live scientific communism!

    假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去
    北京航空学院　何晓
    早在一个世纪以前，德国有一个叫做海尔曼·泽米希的“高明”小丑，天真可爱地“创造”了一个荒唐透顶的理论，曰：“共产主义和社会主义归根到底都消融在人道主义中了。”
    当时，马克思和恩格斯在《德意志意识形态》这一光辉著作中，曾对这个谬论进行过严厉的斥责和彻底的批判。这就明白地告诫我们：人道主义绝不能代替科学共产主义，科学共产主义也绝不能消融在人道主义之中。
    但是，苏修叛徒们却置马克思、恩格斯批判泽米希而不顾，仰承泽米希的唾余，大肆叫嚷：共产主义就是“人道主义”。真可谓反动透顶的谬论。照这样说来，科学共产主义同资本主义又有什么根本区别呢？无产阶级革命同资产阶级启蒙运动时以“人道主义”的口号进行的资产阶级革命又有什么根本区别呢？
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想认为，共产主义社会是彻底消灭了阶级和阶级差别的社会，是全体人民具有高度的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质的社会，是全体人民具有高度的劳动积极性和自觉性的社会，是具有极其丰富的社会产品的社会，是实行“各尽所能，按需分配”原则的社会，是国家消亡了的社会。
    很显然，背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的苏修叛徒们，阉割和歪曲了科学共产主义的这一革命内容和精神实质，把资产阶级所能接受的东西——“人道主义”拿出来，而把不能为资产阶级所接受的东西——消灭阶级，抛弃、抹杀和掩盖起来。他们这样做，说穿了，无非就是想用“人道主义”来否认苏联国内的阶级斗争和阶级存在，用“人道主义”来取消无产阶级专政，用“人道主义”掩盖他们在苏联贩卖的假共产主义的黑货和全面复辟资本主义的丑恶嘴脸。
    列宁在《论俄国各政党》一文中尖锐地指出：“各资产阶级政党，即那些保护资本家经济特权的政党，极力吹嘘自己的党，正如各个资本家吹嘘自己的商品一样。只要看一下任何一张报纸的商业广告，你就可以看到，资本家为自己的商品想出了种种最‘动听’、最响亮、最时髦的名称，他们厚着脸皮，不惜百般撒谎捏造来大吹特吹自己的商品的优良。”
    苏修叛徒们又何尝不如此呢！十多年来，他们为了贩卖假共产主义黑货，玩弄了种种花招。他们一会儿把自己的“共产主义”说成是“一盘土豆烧牛肉的好菜”；一会儿把自己的“共产主义”打扮成“西方皮鞋加大衣”的时装；而今，他们又把自己的“共产主义”描绘成一滴虚伪的鳄鱼眼泪，说什么共产主义就是“人道主义”。他们就是这样厚着脸皮，不惜用撒谎、捏造来大吹特吹自己贩卖的假共产主义黑货。
    但是，万变不离其宗。“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去”。
    列宁指出，“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路”。然而，背叛了无产阶级专政的苏修叛徒们，在苏联实行资产阶级专政、法西斯专政，使苏联向资本主义大倒退，改变了苏联的颜色。
    今天，在十月革命五十年后的苏联，在苏修叛徒们的扶植下，资本主义势力日益猖獗，新的资产阶级分子纷纷生长起来，形成一个资产阶级特权阶层；苏联劳动人民又沦为新剥削阶级的奴隶。阶级差别越来越大，两极分化越来越显著。一位莫斯科的大学生对此气愤地说：“苏联现在已经是一个资本主义国家。高薪的人生活得比西方资本家还好，整个国家的工厂、企业都在他们手中，而普通人却生活得很贫困，甚至比沙皇时代还坏。”
    今天，在十月革命五十年后的苏联，苏修叛徒们大肆贩卖修正主义和资本主义的黑货。他们给资产阶级思想剪彩开闸，任其泛滥；他们为西方腐朽透顶的文化大开绿灯，让它到处充斥。美国资产阶级报刊对此兴高采烈地写道：“与斯大林时代的态度不同，某些西方的事物这些日子已‘进入’俄国的各个方面。”结果，叛徒获得奖金，凶手受到宽容，骗子赢得喝采。活命哲学泛滥，利润高于一切；有钱买得鬼推磨，“各人自扫门前雪”。真是一片乌烟瘴气！
    今天，在十月革命五十年后的苏联，根本谈不上向着社会产品极大丰富的方向发展，而是经济衰退，商品奇缺。同时，今天的苏联，也根本谈不上向着“各尽所能，按需分配”的方向发展，而是劳者不获，获者不劳，资产阶级特权阶层大量地侵吞着苏联人民的劳动果实，贫富越来越悬殊。请听，一位三十年工龄的老工人愤怒地说：“我们这里有好多百万富翁。我们工人用钱是一个戈比一个戈比计算的，连吃饭时都得计算要不要多花一个戈比，可是，这些人把卢布都不当一回事。”
    由此可见，苏修叛徒们之所以叫喊共产主义就是“人道主义”，就是妄图用“人道主义”来掩盖他们贩卖的这种假共产主义的黑货。而他们所谓的“共产主义”，就是资本主义的化身。这样的“共产主义”，是新旧资产阶级分子的天堂，是广大劳动人民的地狱。把这样的“共产主义”说成是什么“人道”，也只能是对新旧资产阶级的人道，对广大劳动人民则是剥削和压迫。如此而已，岂有他哉！
    十多年来，赫鲁晓夫及其继承者们打着“共产主义就是人道主义”的招牌，干尽了不人道的、丧尽天良的坏事。他们利用这块招牌，欺骗苏联人民，掩盖资本主义复辟。他们利用这块招牌，欺骗国际无产阶级和全世界人民，背叛无产阶级国际主义。在这块招牌的掩盖下，他们同美帝国主义大搞“联合行动”，镇压各国人民的革命斗争，推行新殖民主义政策。在这块招牌的掩盖下，他们对被压迫人民和被侵略人民，干着假援助真掠夺，假支持真出卖的罪恶勾当。
    阶级斗争的历史和现实告诉我们，资产阶级起初曾以虚伪的“人道主义”的口号为舆论，最后推翻封建专制制度，建立资本主义制度；后来又把“人道主义”这个口号，变为更加虚伪、骗人的反动口号，以维持资本主义制度和从事一切反动的勾当。现代修正主义也利用这一反动口号，否定马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，歪曲科学共产主义，演变社会主义，复辟资本主义和从事一切反动的勾当。苏联现代修正主义者的所作所为不正是如此吗！然而，无论如何变更，历史都会对它们作出公正的审判。正如恩格斯在《俄国沙皇政府的对外政策》一文中所说：“‘历史的恶作剧’会对它们作出无情的修正。”
    历史证明，谁妄图扼杀社会主义，谁拚命反对共产主义，谁就终究要被历史的车轮轧得粉碎，而遭到可悲的下场。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡科学共产主义“磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春”。
    毛主席说：“十月革命的旗帜是不可战胜的”。
    列宁主义的故乡，虽然暂时被苏修集团篡夺了党和国家的领导权，但是我们坚信，经过了十月革命和卫国战争锻炼和考验的真正的苏联共产党人和伟大的苏联人民，决不会甘心作奴隶。他们一定会识破假共产主义的真面目，重新举起十月革命的旗帜，继承列宁和斯大林的遗志，打碎身上的锁链，斩断一切束缚他们的罗网，把骑在他们头上作威作福的苏修叛徒们打翻在地，让克里姆林宫的红星，重新放射出更加灿烂的光辉。
    列宁主义万岁！
    科学共产主义万岁！
