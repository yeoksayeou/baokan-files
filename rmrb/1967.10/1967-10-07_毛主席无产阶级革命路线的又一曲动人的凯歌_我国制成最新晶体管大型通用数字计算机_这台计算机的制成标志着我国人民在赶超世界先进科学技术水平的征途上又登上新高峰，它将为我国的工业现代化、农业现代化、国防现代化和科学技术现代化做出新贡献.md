In the great triumph of the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and as the nation celebrates the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the scientific and technological front has brought a piece of extremely inspiring news: following the successful research and development of various large-scale general-purpose electronic digital computers, a latest model of transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer has been successfully developed and tested at the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a fruitful achievement of the Cultural Revolution, and another triumphant march of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line over the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the field of science and technology.

The workers, engineers, technicians, scientists, and relevant staff who participated in the research and development of this machine, in order to express their boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, made the machine sing "The East Is Red, the Sun Rises, from China comes Mao Zedong..." when it starts working, followed by a portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and his personal calligraphy "Serve the People," and then quickly and accurately serve the various complex mathematical computation tasks in our socialist construction.

The transistor digital computer is a cutting-edge technology that has emerged in modern times. It integrates the latest achievements in modern radio electronics, semiconductor science, precision machinery, computational mathematics, and industry. Due to its fast computation speed, high precision, strong versatility, and good stability, it is a very useful computation tool in various sectors of the national economy. In fields such as atomic energy, rockets, and space travel, it is an indispensable assistant. The latest model of the transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer that China has successfully developed has already solved a large number of complex practical problems for production, construction, and scientific research design; these problems, if not solved using a high-speed large-scale computer, would require a large number of computational personnel and a long time to calculate, and would easily result in errors, and might not even be well solved. The successful development of this transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer marks that China's computational technology has reached a new level, and that the Chinese people have reached a new height in their journey to catch up with the world's advanced scientific and technological levels. It will make new contributions to the modernization of China's industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology.

This latest model of the transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer is a brilliant achievement born out of the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. Most of the work was completed during the Cultural Revolution. This achievement is a heavy blow to the reactionary policy of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries who attempt to impose a blockade on China in the field of cutting-edge science and technology. At the same time, it declares the complete failure of the revisionist research line pursued by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the scientific and technological community. In this field of research and development, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the scientific and technological community pursued a thoroughgoing slave mentality, crawling mentality, and abolitionist counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They fundamentally did not believe in our own strength and attempted to kneel down to imperialist countries. The working class, engineers, technicians, and scientists of China were extremely indignant about this. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of self-reliance and striving for progress, harboring deep hatred for imperialism, modern revisionism, and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and determined to take on this heavy responsibility. In the process of research and development, they smashed various plots and tricks of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party who attempted to sabotage the work, and achieved success in research and development.

The unprecedented Cultural Revolution greatly promoted the research and development of the transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer. The boundless Mao Zedong Thought gave the workers, engineers, technicians, scientists, and relevant staff who participated in the research and development of this machine infinite wisdom and strength. Chairman Mao taught: "The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, and do not evade problems but solve them actively, any human difficulty can be overcome." The revolutionary workers, technicians, and scientists participating in the development of the transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer, in the process of development, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, earlier than everything, greater than everything, and heavier than everything, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything. With the strong support and help of the People's Liberation Army, they turned the laboratory and machine room into a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and a battlefield for criticizing imperialism and revisionism and carrying out a great criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the scientific and technological community. They used Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to guide class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments, studied and applied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," smashed the "self" and established the "public," determined to overcome all difficulties, and finally overcame the numerous obstacles on the road to progress.

Revolutionary unity provided good conditions for "grasp revolution, promote production" and was also a strong wish of the broad revolutionary masses. Although there were differences on some issues among the revolutionary factions of the Institute of Computing Technology, under the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, they always, everywhere, and at all times put the interests of the proletariat first, put the interests of the state first, considered the overall situation, understood the big picture, sought common ground while reserving differences, and did not bring differences in views to scientific research and production. They insisted on revolutionary unity, united as one, and worked together to ensure the completion of the research and development task of the transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer. The comrades participating in this work said well: "Our computer is a product of revolutionary unity!"

This transistor-based large-scale general-purpose digital computer is entirely made of domestically produced materials and developed using China's own technological strength. The relevant factories and research institutions that participated in this work also closely cooperated with the revolutionary factions of the Institute of Computing Technology, worked together, and made contributions to the successful development of this machine.

    毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一曲动人的凯歌
    我国制成最新晶体管大型通用数字计算机
    这台计算机的制成标志着我国人民在赶超世界先进科学技术水平的征途上又登上新高峰，它将为我国的工业现代化、农业现代化、国防现代化和科学技术现代化做出新贡献
    新华社五日讯　在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，在全国人民欢庆中华人民共和国成立十八周年的时候，我国科学技术战线上传来了一个极为振奋人心的喜讯：继研究试制成功多种大型通用电子数字计算机之后，最近又一台最新型的晶体管大型通用数字计算机，在中国科学院计算技术研究所研究试制成功。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在科学技术工作中所推行的反革命修正主义路线的又一曲动人的凯歌。
    参加研究试制这台机器的全体工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和有关工作人员，为了表达对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰和无限崇拜的感情，使这台机器在投入工作时，首先唱出“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。……”这首亿万革命群众最热爱的动人歌曲，并接着画出我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，和毛主席的亲笔手迹“为人民服务”五个大字，然后开始迅速、准确的为我国社会主义建设事业中的各项浩繁复杂的数学运算任务服务。
    晶体管数字计算机是现代兴起的尖端科学技术，它综合了现代无线电电子学、半导体学、精密机械、计算数学等学科和工业的最新成就，由于它的计算速度快、精确度高、通用性强、稳定性好，在国民经济各部门都是十分有用的计算工具。在原子能、火箭、宇宙航行等尖端技术方面更是不可缺少的助手。我国试制成功的这台最新型的晶体管大型通用数字计算机已经为生产建设和科研设计工作解算出一大批繁重的实际问题；这些问题如果不用高速度的大型计算机来解算，就要用大量计算人员和很长时间来计算，而且容易出差错，甚至还不能很好的解决。这台晶体管大型通用数字计算机的试制成功，标志着我国的计算技术已经提高到了一个新的水平，标志着我国人民在赶超世界先进科学技术水平的征途中又登上了新的高峰，它将为我国的工业现代化、农业现代化、国防现代化和科学技术现代化做出新的贡献。
    这台最新型的晶体管大型通用数字计算机是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中产生的辉煌成果，大部分工作任务都是在无产阶级文化大革命期间完成的。这个成就是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派妄图在尖端科学技术方面对我国进行封锁的反动政策的沉重打击，同时也宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在科技界代理人所推行的修正主义科研路线的彻底破产。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在科技界代理人在这方面的研究试制工作中推行了一条彻头彻尾的奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义的反革命修正主义路线，他们根本不相信我们自己的力量，企图向帝国主义国家屈膝投降。我国的工人阶级、工程技术人员和科学工作者对此万分气愤，他们牢记伟大领袖毛主席自力更生、奋发图强的教导，怀着对帝国主义、现代修正主义和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的深仇大恨，下定决心，走自己的路，毅然挑起了这副重担。他们在研究试制过程中，又粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图从中进行破坏的种种阴谋诡计，取得了研究试制的成功。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，极大地推动了晶体管大型通用数字计算机的研究试制工作。光焰无际的毛泽东思想给予参加研究试制这台机器的全体工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和有关人员以无穷的智慧和力量。毛主席教导说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”参加晶体管大型通用数字计算机研制工作的革命工人、技术人员和科学工作者，在研制过程中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，先于一切，大于一切，重于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，推动一切。他们在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，把实验室和机房当成活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，当成反帝反修和对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在科技界的代理人开展革命大批判的战场。他们用毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》、《矛盾论》来指导阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，大学大用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，下定决心，不怕牺牲，终于排除了前进道路上的重重困难。
    革命的大联合，为“抓革命，促生产”提供了良好的条件，也是广大革命群众的强烈愿望。计算技术研究所的无产阶级革命派之间，虽然在一些问题上有过分歧，但是，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他们处处、事事、时时以无产阶级的利益为重，以国家利益为重，顾大局，识大体，求大同，存小异，绝不把观点的分歧带到科研生产中去，绝不因观点不同影响科研生产任务的完成。他们坚持革命的大联合，团结一致，齐心协力，保证了晶体管大型通用数字计算机研究试制任务的完成。参加这项工作的同志们说得好：“我们这台计算机，是革命大联合的产物！”
    这台晶体管大型通用数字计算机是全部采用国产器材、用我国自己的技术力量研制出来的。参加这项工作的有关工厂和科研单位的无产阶级革命派也和计算技术研究所的无产阶级革命派紧密协作，大力协同，共同为试制成功这台机器作出了贡献。
