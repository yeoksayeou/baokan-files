Premier Zhou Enlai this afternoon received Babu, the Minister of Lands, Settlement, and Water Development of the United Republic of Tanzania, and members of the Tanzanian Friendship Delegation led by him, and had a cordial and friendly conversation with them.

Present at the reception were relevant officials from our side, as well as Mwaluko, the Tanzanian Ambassador to China.

Babu, the Tanzanian Minister of Lands, Settlement, and Water Development, who is currently visiting Beijing, said at a banquet he held on September 30 to celebrate his visit to China, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made the imperialists and all reactionaries tremble. Despite the various propaganda tricks used by imperialists and reactionaries in various countries to slander the Chinese people and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the African people fully know that the powerful People's Republic of China stands with the oppressed peoples who are fighting against imperialism."

Relevant officials from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were invited to attend the banquet. Du Xingyuan, Vice Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power, spoke at the banquet, expressing his belief that the visit of the Tanzanian Friendship Delegation to China will further promote friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

Mwaluko, the Tanzanian Ambassador to China, also attended the banquet.
