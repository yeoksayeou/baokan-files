Celebrating the 18th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China

Telegram of Congratulations from the Party and State Leaders of Albania

To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman Lin Biao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Dear Comrades:

On the great occasion of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we, representing the Albanian people, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Council of Ministers, as well as in our personal capacities, extend our most fervent revolutionary greetings and most sincere fraternal congratulations to you and, through you, to the fraternal Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

Over the past 18 years, the heroic and industrious Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong in Marxism-Leninism, have achieved magnificent successes in all aspects of socialist construction in their motherland. Today, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful socialist state with modern industry, advanced socialist agriculture, revolutionary new culture and science, and a strong national defense. This year's successful test of the first hydrogen bomb once again vividly demonstrates the boundless strength and rare genius of the great Chinese people, a brilliant victory for the infallible Marxism-Leninism of the Communist Party of China. On the occasion of the 18th anniversary, the People's Republic of China stands as an unshakable stronghold of revolution and socialism, a major and reliable backbone for the struggle of the peoples of all countries for freedom, national independence, and socialism. The principled foreign policy of the People's Republic of China and its resolute and unyielding struggle against the aggressive policies of the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism and their lackeys have won the admiration, respect, and support of the freedom-loving peoples of the world and have become a great inspiration for them in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

The glorious Communist Party of China, hoisting high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong, is a powerful shock brigade and fighting force that has always honorably fulfilled its lofty duty of defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, strengthening the international communist movement, and fighting against the betrayal and attacks of the modern revisionists centered around the renegade leadership of the CPSU.

Today, under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people are united as one, with the irresistible tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing and burying the revisionist enemies and counter-revolutionary enemies headed by China's Khrushchev. Today, the Chinese people firmly hold proletarian dictatorship in their powerful hands, continuously consolidating proletarian dictatorship and the victory of socialism, blocking the road to the emergence of revisionism and the danger of capitalist restoration in People's China. This is the greatest victory achieved by the Chinese people since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the vicious plots and tricks of imperialism led by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism led by the renegade group in the Soviet Union. The imperialists and modern revisionists are terrified by the irresistible momentum shown by the great Chinese people on the road of revolution, slandering and attempting to obstruct the development of People's China. However, no force in the world can stop the advance of the Chinese giant. The enemies—imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries—will be smashed to pieces before this giant. The banner of Marxism-Leninism and the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong will forever proudly fly over the great People's China.

The Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party are proud to have the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China as true friends, reliable comrades-in-arms, and sincere brothers in adversity. The fighting friendship and iron-clad unity based on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism bind us together. Our two peoples, two parties, and two countries have shown indestructible vitality and strength in stormy weather and in the common struggle against imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism. On our glorious path, our two peoples and two parties will always advance side by side, adding more luster to the eternal friendship between Albania and China.

The Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party are immensely happy about the historic victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sincerely congratulate these victories, and regard them as their own victories. On this glorious occasion, we once again sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people and the Communist Party of China new and greater victories in implementing the great teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong in Marxism-Leninism, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the selfless labor of building socialism in China, and in the resolute struggle for the victory of our common cause—the cause of socialism and revolution.

May the great revolutionary friendship between the peoples and parties of Albania and China continue to develop, strengthen, and flourish forever.

Telegram of Congratulations from the Party and State Leaders of Vietnam

To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman Lin Biao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Dear Comrades:

On the occasion of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Labor Party, the National Assembly and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in our personal capacities, extend our most cordial and warmest congratulations to you and, through you, to the fraternal seven hundred million Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the National People's Congress, and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

The success of the Chinese revolution and the birth of the People's Republic of China are extremely important international events following the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution, which have completely changed the balance of power in favor of socialism and greatly promoted the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Over the past 18 years, the great Chinese people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, have overcome all difficulties and achieved great victories in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The successful tests of China's atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, and missile nuclear weapons have enhanced the national defense of the People's Republic of China as a socialist power and, at the same time, are a great encouragement to the revolutionary peoples of the world who are fighting against U.S.-led imperialism for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism.

The Vietnamese people are very happy and inspired by the brilliant victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people and regard these victories as a great encouragement for their own struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

The Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the Chinese people have consistently upheld proletarian internationalism, resolutely raised the banner of struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, and at the same time firmly supported the national liberation movements and actively defended world peace.

The Vietnamese people sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, greater victories in the cause of socialist construction and the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China are two socialist countries with a close relationship like lips and teeth. In the struggle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism—the solidarity between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples has been increasingly consolidated and developed. In the past revolutionary struggles and in the current struggle to defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the country, the Vietnamese people have always received the resolute support and assistance full of proletarian internationalism from the fraternal Chinese people. The Vietnamese people highly appreciate the immense and precious role played by the comprehensive assistance provided by the People's Republic of China and express their deepest gratitude to the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

The Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Labor Party, the National Assembly, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have always been loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. For the interests of our two peoples, for the interests of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, and for the common revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world, we are willing to use all our strength to consolidate and further strengthen the fraternal friendship and fighting unity between our two countries.

May the indestructible fighting unity between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples flourish forever.

Telegram of Congratulations from the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

To Chairman Mao Zedong, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the people of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and in my personal capacity, extend my warmest congratulations to the Chairman, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the fraternal seven hundred million Chinese people.

Over the past 18 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China headed by the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved extraordinary achievements in the cause of national construction, creating great successes. The Chinese people, with a thorough revolutionary and striving spirit, have bravely overcome all difficulties, worked hard, and engaged in creative, diligent labor, transforming the old China, which was oppressed, exploited, and impoverished, into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern national defense foundation. Especially, this year's successful test of the first hydrogen bomb marks the miraculous development of China's science and technology. The people of South Vietnam are delighted and inspired by the great victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people and regard these victories as their own.

Since its birth, the People's Republic of China has consistently upheld the spirit of resolute struggle, opposing imperialism and colonialism, wholeheartedly supporting the national liberation movements, and actively defending world peace.

In their sacred struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, the people of South Vietnam have always received the thorough sympathy and support, as well as the immense, sincere, and effective assistance from the great Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the Chinese people. This precious support and assistance have greatly encouraged us in our just cause of defeating the U.S. aggressors. The people of South Vietnam, generation after generation, deeply cherish and value this lofty fighting friendship from the fraternal Chinese people and are willing to continually consolidate and develop the fighting friendship and unity between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples. In the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, we will forever fight side by side with the Chinese people, continue to vigorously advance the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and strive for final victory.

On this occasion, we sincerely wish the heroic Chinese people continued great victories in the cause of economic, national defense, and cultural construction, the overfulfillment of the Third Five-Year Plan, the liberation of Taiwan, the timely smashing of all anti-China provocations and war actions by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and greater contributions to the cause of the peoples of the world in their struggle against U.S.-led imperialism for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress.

May the indestructible friendship and fighting unity between the people of South Vietnam and the fraternal Chinese people flourish forever.

    庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年
    阿尔巴尼亚党和国家领导人的贺电北京中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们：
    在十月一日中华人民共和国成立十八周年伟大节日的时候，我们怀着十分愉快和兴奋的心情，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团和部长会议，并以我们个人的名义，向你们，并通过你们向兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府，致以最热烈的革命敬礼和最真挚的兄弟般的祝贺。
    十八年来，英勇勤劳的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的马克思列宁主义的英明领导下，在自己祖国的社会主义建设的各方面取得了宏伟的成就。今天，中华人民共和国已成为拥有现代化工业、社会主义的先进农业、革命的新文化、新科学和强大的国防力量的强大的社会主义国家。今年第一颗氢弹的爆炸成功，再一次生动地证明了伟大的中国人民的取之不尽的力量和罕见的天才，这是中国共产党战无不胜的马克思列宁主义正确性的光辉胜利。在庆祝十八周年的时候，中华人民共和国作为革命和社会主义的坚不可摧的强大堡垒，作为各国人民争取自由、民族独立和社会主义的斗争的主要的强大的和可靠的后盾，巍然屹立在世界各国人民面前。中华人民共和国的原则性的外交政策和对以美帝为首的帝国主义及其仆从的侵略政策所进行的坚决的和毫不妥协的斗争，赢得了世界各国爱好自由的人民的赞扬、尊敬和支持，并成为他们在反对帝国主义、殖民主义和各国反动派的斗争中的伟大的鼓舞榜样。
    光荣的中国共产党，高举马克思列宁主义和毛泽东主席思想的旗帜，是一支保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、加强国际共产主义运动和反对以苏共叛徒领导为中心的现代修正主义者的背叛和攻击的强大的突击队和战斗队，一贯光荣地履行了它所肩负的崇高义务。
    今天，兄弟的中国人民在毛泽东同志的直接领导下，团结得象一个人一样，在无产阶级文化大革命势不可挡的浪潮中，以雷霆万钧之力，正在粉碎和埋葬以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的修正主义敌人和反革命敌人。今天，中国人民把无产阶级专政牢牢地掌握在自己强有力的手中，并不断地巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义的胜利，堵塞在人民中国产生修正主义的道路和复辟资本主义的危险。这是中国人民在中华人民共和国成立以后所取得的最伟大的胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，粉碎了以美帝为首的帝国主义和以苏联叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义的恶毒的阴谋诡计。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者被伟大的中国人民在革命的道路上表现的势不可挡的气魄吓得胆颤心惊，他们进行诽谤并妄图阻挡人民中国向前发展。但是，世界上没有任何力量能够阻止中国巨人的前进。敌人——帝国主义、修正主义和反动派必将在这个巨人面前碰得头破血流。马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的思想的旗帜将永远骄傲地飘扬在伟大的人民中国的上空。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为有伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党这个患难之交和忠实的朋友、真正的战友和真挚的兄弟而感到自豪，建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的不朽原则基础上的战斗友谊、钢铁般的牢不可破的团结把我们联系在一起。我们两国人民、两党和两国之间的战斗友谊和国际主义的钢铁般的团结，在急风暴雨中，在反对帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的共同斗争中，表现了坚不可摧的生命力和力量。我们两国人民和两党在自己的光荣道路上，将永远肩并肩地共同前进，为阿中永恒的友谊日益增添光辉。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，对兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的历史性的胜利感到无限高兴，衷心地祝贺这些胜利，并把这些胜利看作是自己的胜利。在这光辉的节日里，我们再一次衷心地祝兄弟的中国人民和中国共产党在贯彻伟大的毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的教导方面，在无产阶级文化大革命中，在中国建设社会主义的忘我劳动中，在为争取我们的共同事业——社会主义和革命事业的胜利而进行的坚决的斗争中，取得新的更大的胜利。
    祝阿中两国人民和两党之间的伟大的革命友谊不断发展、加强和万古长青。

    越南党和国家领导人的贺电北京中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们：
    值此中华人民共和国国庆十八周年之际，我们谨代表越南人民，越南劳动党，越南民主共和国国会和政府，并以我们个人的名义，向你们并通过你们向兄弟的七亿中国人民、中国共产党、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会和政府致以最亲切、最热烈的祝贺。
    中国革命的成功，中华人民共和国的诞生，是伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利之后的一个极其重要的国际事件，使世界力量的对比发生了完全有利于社会主义的变化，并大大推动了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。十八年来，用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民，在中国共产党的英明领导下，克服了一切困难，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中不断取得巨大的胜利。中国原子弹、氢弹和导弹核武器的试验成功，增强了作为社会主义强国的中华人民共和国的国防力量，同时，对正在反对以美国为首的帝国主义，为争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义而斗争的全世界革命人民是巨大的鼓舞。
    越南人民对于兄弟的中国人民所取得的辉煌胜利感到十分高兴和振奋，并把这些胜利看作是对自己的抗美救国斗争事业的巨大鼓舞。
    中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，忠于无产阶级国际主义，一贯高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争旗帜，同时坚决大力支持民族解放运动，积极保卫世界和平。
    越南人民衷心祝愿兄弟的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义建设事业和当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，将取得更加巨大的胜利。
    越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国是有着唇齿般的紧密关系的两个社会主义国家，在反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，越、中两国人民之间的战斗团结日益得到巩固和发展。在过去的革命斗争事业中以及目前为保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国的抗美救国斗争中，越南人民一贯得到兄弟的中国人民的坚决支持和充满无产阶级国际主义精神的援助。越南人民高度评价中华人民共和国所给予的全面援助所产生的无比巨大和珍贵的作用，并对中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府表示十分深切的感谢。
    越南人民、越南劳动党、越南民主共和国国会和政府，始终如一地忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，为了我们两国人民的利益，为了国际共产主义运动和工人运动以及全世界人民的共同的革命事业的利益，愿以我们的全部力量，不断巩固和进一步增强两国之间的兄弟友谊和战斗团结。
    祝越南人民和中国人民之间牢不可破的战斗团结万古长青。越南劳动党中央委员会主席越南民主共和国主席胡志明

    中华人民共和国从她诞生的那一天起，一贯高度发扬坚决斗争的精神，反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义，全心全力支持民族解放运动，积极保卫世界和平。
    越南南方人民在自己的神圣反美救国抗战中，一向得到伟大的中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民彻底的同情和支持以及十分巨大的、真诚慷慨的、有效的援助。这种宝贵的支持和援助，有力地鼓舞着我们进行战胜美国侵略者的正义事业。越南南方人民世世代代深切地感谢和珍视兄弟的中国人民的这种崇高的战斗友谊，愿不断地巩固和发展越、中两个民族之间的战斗友谊和团结，在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗的战斗中，永远和中国人民并肩战斗，继续大力推进反美救国抗战事业，直到取得最后胜利。
