Chairman Mao says: "Not only should one look at a cadre's actions at a particular time and on a particular matter, but one must also look at the cadre's entire history and all his work. This is the main method for identifying cadres."

Based on Chairman Mao's consistent teachings on cadre issues, we have conducted a serious class analysis of the "number one in command" among the leading cadres of our factory, and in March of this year, in conjunction with his assumption of the position of standing committee member of the revolutionary committee, we assigned him to lead the factory's political department.

The "number one in command" of our factory, the original Party Committee Secretary Yang Zongtian, executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the initial stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, directing the struggle spearhead against the masses. However, is Yang Zongtian a capitalist-roader in power within the Party?

Chairman Mao teaches us that we must take an analytical attitude towards any problem. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we conducted a class analysis of Comrade Yang Zongtian. He has made errors in executing the bourgeois reactionary line. However, during several crucial turning points in the revolution, he did not continue to execute the bourgeois reactionary line. For example, on September 6 of last year, the factory Party Committee organized a large number of workers to go to Guiyang to besiege revolutionary students. At that time, Comrade Yang Zongtian was in Beijing attending a meeting. Upon learning of this, he immediately called back to stop this action. From the end of December last year to the beginning of January this year, the capitalist-roaders within the Party deceived the masses, stirring up a strong economic wind, inciting a large number of workers to leave their production posts, disrupting the revolution and promoting production. Comrade Yang Zongtian resisted the counter-revolutionary economic wind and stood firm against the brutal struggle waged by the deceived masses against him.

The "January Revolution" storm sounded the call for the proletarian revolutionary factions to seize power. On January 24, the proletarian revolutionary factions in our factory seized the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the capitalist-roaders within the Party. The capitalist-roaders within the Party were terrified and enraged by the revolutionary factions' seizure of power. Therefore, they launched a fierce counterattack against the revolutionary factions. At this critical moment, Comrade Yang Zongtian supported the revolutionary factions' seizure of power. These facts show that he is not a steadfast executor of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Then, is he a deeply hidden "black line" figure? With this question in mind, we again studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To understand the situation, the only method is to conduct a social survey." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we conducted an in-depth and detailed investigation. The results of the investigation show that, from his entire history and all his work, he is a relatively good cadre and not a capitalist-roader within the Party. Thus, we reached a common conclusion: Comrade Yang Zongtian has executed the bourgeois reactionary line, but the nature of his errors is still within the scope of contradictions among the people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Different types of contradictions can only be resolved by different types of methods." "Past errors must definitely be exposed without mercy, and they must be analyzed and criticized with a scientific attitude to prevent future errors and to do better work." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we exposed and criticized Comrade Yang Zongtian's errors without mercy. When he began to realize his errors, we actively helped him find the root cause and assess the damage. When he began to correct his errors, we enthusiastically encouraged him to continue progressing. At the same time, we created good conditions for him to "come out on the front line" and accept the examination of the revolutionary masses.

At the beginning, Comrade Yang Zongtian was afraid to "come out on the front line" and still had some fear. Because he was the "number one in command," he was afraid that all the problems exposed would be blamed on him, or even if not all, they would still be connected to him. After understanding the root of Comrade Yang Zongtian's fear, we studied Chairman Mao's works with him, helped him overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, put down his burden, start his engine, and lighten his load to join the battle. Thus, Comrade Yang Zongtian finally experienced the storms and saw the world in the masses' struggle, quickly "came out on the front line."

Helping the "number one in command" who has made errors to quickly "come out on the front line" not only severely struck the capitalist-roaders within the Party but also had a significant effect on liberating the majority of cadres. Because the "number one in command" has the greatest influence on cadres, the "number one in command" coming out on the front line can quickly bring a group of cadres to also "come out on the front line," making the capitalist-roaders within the Party even more isolated.

When preparing to establish the revolutionary committee, we proposed to include Comrade Yang Zongtian. However, there were differing opinions within the revolutionary factions: one opinion was that the revolutionary "number one in command," despite making serious errors, should be included in the revolutionary "three-in-one" leading cadre group after being criticized and helped by the revolutionary masses, coming out on the front line, and sincerely correcting his errors, beginning to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and should be assigned a certain leadership position to play his role and continue to reform himself in his work; the other opinion was that he should not be included because he was the "number one in command," executed the bourgeois reactionary line, and persecuted the masses, and should be tested for a long time, otherwise, it would be compromising and conciliating. We believe that the latter thought does not conform to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. We disclosed Comrade Yang Zongtian's problem to the revolutionary masses, conducted in-depth and detailed ideological work, insisted on the correct opinion, and obtained the support of the broad revolutionary masses.

More than seven months of practice have proven that boldly absorbing revolutionary leading cadres to participate in the "three-in-one" temporary power organ, giving full play to their core role and leading role, is the key to implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one" policy and an important link to ensuring that the proletarian revolutionary factions hold and use power well.

    对“第一把手”必须作阶级分析
    贵州柴油机厂无产阶级革命派联合司令部
    毛主席说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”
    根据毛主席关于干部问题的一贯教导，我们对本厂领导干部中“第一把手”，进行了认真的阶级分析，并且在今年三月份结合他担任革命委员会常委，负责领导工厂政治部的工作。
    我们厂的“第一把手”原党委书记杨宗田，在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，执行资产阶级反动路线，把斗争矛头指向了群众。但是，杨宗田到底是不是党内走资本主义道路当权派呢？
    毛主席教导我们，对于任何问题应取分析态度。根据毛主席的教导，我们对杨宗田同志进行了阶级分析。他执行过资产阶级反动路线，是有错误的。可是，在以后几次革命转折的紧要关头，他没有继续执行资产阶级反动路线。例如，去年九月六日，我厂党委组织大批职工到贵阳去围斗革命学生，当时杨宗田同志在北京开会，他知道后，立即打长途电话回来制止这种行动。去年十二月底到今年一月初，我厂党内走资本主义道路当权派蒙蔽群众，大刮经济主义妖风，煽动大批职工离开生产岗位，破坏抓革命，促生产。杨宗田同志对反革命经济主义黑风进行了抵制，顶住了受蒙蔽群众对他进行的残酷斗争。
      “一月革命”风暴吹响了无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的号角，我厂无产阶级革命派于一月二十四日从党内走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回了党、政、财、文大权。党内走资本主义道路当权派对无产阶级革命派的夺权行动怕得要死，恨得要命。因此，对革命派进行了疯狂的反扑。在这个关键时刻，杨宗田同志则支持了革命派夺权的革命行动。这些事实说明，他不是资产阶级反动路线的坚决执行者。
    那么，他是不是隐蔽得很深的“黑线人物”呢？我们带着这个问题，又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“要了解情况，唯一的方法是向社会作调查”。按照毛主席的教导，我们作了深入细致的调查研究。调查的结果，从他的全部历史和全部工作来看，他是比较好的干部，不是党内走资本主义道路的当权派。这样，我们就得出了一个共同结论，杨宗田同志执行过资产阶级反动路线，但所犯错误的性质还是属于人民内部矛盾。
    毛主席教导我们：“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”“对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去的坏东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些。”按照毛主席的教导，我们对杨宗田同志所犯的错误，进行了毫不留情的揭发和批判。当他开始认识到错误的时候，我们就积极地帮助他挖根源，查危害。在他开始改正错误的时候，我们就热情地鼓励他继续进步。同时，我们给他创造了良好的“火线亮相”条件，让他接受革命群众的检验。
    开始，杨宗田同志不敢在火线上“亮相”，还有个“怕”字。因为他是“第一把手”，怕揭发出来的问题一下子都算在他的头上，或者虽不都算在他头上，也都牵连着他。了解到杨宗田同志怕的思想根源之后，我们就和他一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他破私立公，放下包袱开动机器，轻装上阵，站出来揭发党内走资本主义道路当权派，同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂。这样，杨宗田同志终于在群众斗争中经了风雨，见了世面，比较快地在火线上亮了相。
    帮助犯了错误的“第一把手”尽快地“火线亮相”，不仅狠狠地打击了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，而且对解放干部大多数有很大的作用。因为“第一把手”对干部影响最大，“第一把手”在火线上亮了相，可以带动一批干部很快地也在火线上“亮相”，使党内走资本主义道路当权派更加孤立。
    在筹建革命委员会时，我们提出要结合杨宗田同志，但是，在革命派内部产生了意见分歧：一种意见认为，革命的“第一把手”，尽管犯了严重错误，经过革命群众批评、帮助，在火线上亮了相，认真改正自己的错误，开始回到毛主席的革命路线上来，就应该把他结合到革命的“三结合”领导班子里边来，担任一定的领导工作，发挥他的作用，让他在工作中继续改造自己；另一种意见则认为不能结合他，因为他是“第一把手”，执行了资产阶级反动路线，整了群众，应该长期考验，否则就是搞折中，搞调和。我们认为后一种思想是不符合毛主席干部政策的。我们把杨宗田同志的问题向革命群众交了底，作了深入细致的思想工作，坚持了正确的意见，得到了广大革命群众的支持。
    七个多月的实践证明，大胆地吸收革命领导干部参加“三结合”的临时权力机构，发挥他们的骨干作用和核心作用，这是贯彻执行毛主席的革命“三结合”方针的关键，也是保证无产阶级革命派掌好权、用好权的一个重要环节。
