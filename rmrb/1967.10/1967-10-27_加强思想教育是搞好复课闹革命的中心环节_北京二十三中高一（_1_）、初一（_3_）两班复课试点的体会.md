The winds of the East are prevailing over the winds of the West, and the red flags are flying high. The great wave of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is surging forward. Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the help of the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, our school's Grade 1 (1) and Grade 7 (3) classes began a pilot program for resuming classes and making revolution one month ago.

Chairman Mao said: "Mastering ideological education is the key to uniting the entire party for great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the party's political tasks cannot be completed."

At the beginning of resuming classes, most teachers and students had a correct understanding, but there were also some incorrect views. Some students said: "Our two classes have poor discipline, resuming classes is to discipline us." Others said: "I'll come to listen to classes, but the reform has nothing to do with me." Some teachers said: "Let's resume classes! Resuming classes will make students come to school. Without resuming classes, it's hard to get by!"

In response to these active thoughts, the revolutionary teachers and students of the two classes studied Chairman Mao's instructions on educational issues, as well as his teachings on revolutionary criticism, class, and class struggle. This raised everyone's awareness. Class 1 (1) also organized report meetings and discussion meetings, criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in the educational field for their heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism, and exposing the harm of the old educational system to young people. The intense class struggle on the educational front over the past seventeen years made the students realize: whether or not to carry out an educational revolution is a major issue concerning whether our next generation will produce revisionism. The political responsibility of teachers and students increased, and everyone expressed: We must strive for the proletariat and achieve new victories in resuming classes and making revolution.

After resuming classes, some new problems arose. Some students thought: "The old educational system, teaching policies, and methods have not been thoroughly criticized, resuming classes is resuming the old." Some teachers also said: "The old system is broken and cannot be used, the new system has not been established, how can we teach?" Therefore, some teachers and students had a wait-and-see attitude. How to handle the relationship between teaching and reform naturally became an issue before us. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the people's business, often not learned before doing, but learned while doing, doing is learning," and "Learning to swim while swimming." They also studied the instructions of central leaders on educational reform. Through study and discussion, everyone realized that the current resumption of classes is not primarily for learning cultural and scientific knowledge, but to make a revolution. We cannot wait until everything is ready before resuming classes. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, pooling collective wisdom, practicing and summarizing while teaching and reforming, can we find good methods in revolutionary practice.

The first political class in Grade 1 (1) is a good example. After resuming classes, teachers and students displayed a revolutionary spirit, merging political class and language class. However, no one had a ready-made method for teaching. After a few days of discussion and research, based on the active thoughts of Grade 1 (1), the topic "Education Must Be Revolutionary" was determined, with students giving the lecture. This changed the past phenomenon of teachers lecturing in isolation from reality. In the classroom, students eagerly spoke up, and the discussion was very lively. In this way, students had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's thought on educational revolution. Teachers and students said that this class truly followed the mass line and was successful. We realized in practice: Resuming classes while reforming and improving is an effective way to gradually carry out the educational revolution.

In the preparation for resuming classes, some teachers had three fears: fear of being criticized, fear of taking responsibility, and fear of students "rebelling." Their mental burden was heavy.

In response to these active thoughts, teachers and class revolutionary committees, together with comrades from the People's Liberation Army, studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," his speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China, and his instructions on establishing a new type of revolutionary teacher-student relationship. Especially Chairman Mao's recent call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism greatly educated and inspired the teachers. Through study, teachers realized that the "fear" ultimately stems from a "selfish" attitude, a lack of resolve to humble oneself and learn. Teachers' awareness was raised, and they openly exposed their selfish thoughts in the struggle sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Teachers said that resuming classes and reforming education is a great revolution. In this revolution, one must transform one's subjective world and fight selfishness to better criticize revisionism. Students, through study, realized that they are also the main force of the educational revolution and should actively cooperate with teachers to carry out educational reform. Through fighting selfishness, teachers' moods improved. In the process of resuming classes, teachers, as ordinary soldiers, prepared lessons and discussed with students, deeply entered the student community, sought opinions, and humbly learned from the revolutionary youngsters. A new type of teacher-student relationship of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers" was initially established.

After initially correcting the understanding of resuming classes and making revolution, many specific problems were encountered in the preparation process. We responded to Chairman Mao's great call to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously promote the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and fight against selfishness, overcoming the ideological obstacles in the path of resuming classes and making revolution.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The growth of any new thing is bound to be fraught with difficulties and twists and turns. In the cause of socialism, to expect no difficulties and twists and turns, to expect no great efforts, and to expect smooth sailing and easy success is sheer fantasy."

When difficulties were encountered at the beginning of resuming classes, some said: "Choosing these two classes as the pilot for resuming classes was a mistake." The PLA soldiers, in response to the active thoughts of some teachers and students who lacked confidence, organized everyone to list achievements and favorable conditions. Through discussion, everyone realized: Since military training, the main achievement has been following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasping the direction of the struggle, and carrying out revolutionary criticism. Everyone saw the achievements, listed the favorable conditions, and increased their confidence.

When encountering difficulties, we studied Chairman Mao's sayings on "self-reliance and arduous struggle" and used Mao Zedong Thought to overcome all difficulties on the path forward.

Through fighting selfishness, teachers further correctly treated difficulties and setbacks. When encountering failure, they no longer complained but found the cause within themselves. A teacher in Grade 1 (1) was very enthusiastic about educational reform, preparing lessons day and night, wanting to use new teaching methods to review the knowledge students had learned before. However, due to students forgetting much of the knowledge they had learned, the evaluation of this class by the students was not good. This teacher, upon hearing the students' criticism, not only did not become discouraged but immediately said: "The first class was not taught well because it did not follow the mass line like the political class." After class, she sought the students' opinions, saying: "Today's failure is tomorrow's success." With renewed confidence, she prepared lessons with the students, and the second class showed significant progress.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Discipline is the guarantee for implementing the line. Without discipline, the party cannot lead the masses and the army to victory in struggle." Vice Chairman Lin said: "The human factor is the first."

The biggest problem in Grade 7 (3) was low attendance and poor discipline.

What to do if students do not come to school? Chairman Mao said: "Investigation is solving problems." The active elements, Red Guards, and teachers in the class conducted home visits and found that the main reasons students did not come to school were: mainly a lack of understanding of resuming classes and making revolution, some students were lazy and did not want to come to school, some wanted to work and did not want to study, some wanted to help their families more, and some parents were afraid their children would get into trouble outside and did not let them out, etc. In response to these situations, the school, in addition to persuading and mobilizing the students, also held a parents' meeting and obtained the strong support of the parents. Later, Grade 7 (3) increased from an average of 25 students attending each day to 37, reaching 95%. The discipline in the class also improved significantly.

Since our school resumed classes and made revolution, revolutionary teachers and students have made great ideological progress. Practice has proven: Achieving revolutionary great unity in the class is the foundation for resuming classes and making revolution, and resuming classes and educational revolution also promote revolutionary great unity in the class.

    加强思想教育是搞好复课闹革命的中心环节
    ——北京二十三中高一（1）、初一（3）两班复课试点的体会
    北京市二十三中革命委员会
    东风浩荡，红旗招展，无产阶级文化大革命的巨浪滚滚向前。紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛泽东思想的指引下，在解放军同志的帮助下，我校高一（1）、初一（3）两班在一个月之前开始了复课闹革命的试点。
    毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
    开始复课时，大多数师生对复课的认识是正确的，但是也有一些错误的认识，有的学生说：“我们两班纪律差，复课是为了整我们”。有的说：“复课我就来听，教改与我无关。”部分教师则说：“复吧！复点文化课学生就会来校了。不复课日子不好过！”
    针对这些活思想，两班革命师生学习了毛主席有关教育问题的指示，以及关于革命大批判、阶级和阶级斗争的教导，提高了大家的认识。高一（1）班还组织了报告会、讨论会，大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，大揭旧教育制度对青少年的毒害。十七年来教育战线上惊心动魄的阶级斗争，使同学们认识到：搞不搞教育革命是关系到我国下一代出不出修正主义的大问题。师生的政治责任感增强了，大家表示：一定要为无产阶级争气，在复课闹革命中建新功。
    复课以后，出现了一些新的问题。有的同学认为：“目前旧的教育制度、教学方针、方法，还没有批深批透，复课就是复旧。”部分老师也说：“旧的破了，不能用了，新的还没有建立起来，课怎么上呢？”因此部分师生有等待思想。如何处理教和改的关系，就自然地摆在我们面前了。大家学习了毛主席“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习”，“在游泳中学会游泳”的教导，学习了中央负责同志有关教学改革的指示。经过学习和讨论，大家认识到，当前复课首先不是为了学文化科学知识，而是要搞革命。我们不能幻想等到什么都准备好了才复课，只有充分发动群众，群策群力，边实践边总结，边教边改，在革命实践中才能摸索出好的方法来。
    高一（1）班第一堂政治课就是一个很好的例子。复课后师生发扬了敢于革命的精神，把政治课和语文课合并了。但是究竟怎样上课，谁也没有现成的办法。经过了几天的讨论研究，根据高一（1）班的活思想，确定了以“教育要革命”为题，由学生来讲课，改变了过去教师脱离实际空讲的现象，课堂上同学们争着发言，讨论得非常热烈。这样，同学们对毛主席的教育要革命的思想体会得更深了。师生都说，这堂课真正地走了群众路线，上得成功。我们在实践中体会到：边复课，边教改，边提高，是逐步进行教育革命的有效途径。
    在复课的准备工作中，部分教师有三怕：怕挨批、怕负责任、怕同学“造反”。思想负担很重。
    针对这些活思想，教师和班文革、解放军同志一起学习了毛主席的“老三篇”、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》和关于建立新型的革命的师生关系的指示。特别是毛主席最近发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召，给教师以极大的教育和鼓舞。经过学习，教师们认识到：“怕”字，归根结底还是一个“私”字，是没有放下臭架子，甘当小学生的决心。教师们认识提高了，纷纷在毛泽东思想学习班的斗私会上亮了自己的私心。教师们说，复课搞教改是一场伟大的革命，在这场革命中，必须改造主观世界，必须斗私，才能更好地批修。同学们经过学习，认识到自己也是教育革命的主力军，应当积极配合老师搞好教改。通过斗私，老师们的心情舒畅了。在复课的过程中，教师以普通一兵的身份和同学一起备课、讨论，深入到同学中去，征求意见，虚心地向革命小将学习。一个“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的新型的师生关系初步建立起来了。
    初步端正了对复课闹革命的认识以后，在准备复课的过程中，又遇到了许多具体问题。我们响应了毛主席的伟大号召，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，克服了复课闹革命前进道路上的思想障碍。
    毛主席教导我们说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”
    开始复课时遇到一些困难，有人就说：“选这两个班搞复课的试点，是找错了门。”解放军指战员针对部分师生信心不足的活思想，组织大家摆成绩，摆有利条件，通过讨论，大家认识到：军训以来，成绩是主要的，最大的成绩，就是紧跟了毛主席的伟大战略部署，掌握斗争的大方向，开展了革命的大批判。大家看到了成绩，摆出了有利条件，增强了信心。
    遇到困难，就学习毛主席有关“自力更生，艰苦奋斗”的语录，用毛泽东思想战胜前进道路上的一切困难。
    通过斗“私”，老师们进一步正确地对待困难和挫折，遇到失败，不再抱怨，而是从主观上找原因。高一（1）班有一位教师，对教改的积极性很大，白天晚上备课，想用讲新课的方法来复习过去学生学过的知识。可是由于同学们把已学的知识忘了很多，同学对这节课的评价并不好。这位老师听了同学的批评，不但情绪没低落，而且当堂就说：“第一堂课没上好，就是没象上政治课那样，走群众路线。”下课后，她征求了同学的意见，说：“今天的失败，就是明天的成功。”又信心百倍地和同学一起备课，第二节课很有进步。
    毛主席教导我们：“纪律是执行路线的保证，没有纪律，党就无法率领群众与军队进行胜利的斗争。”林副主席说：“人的因素第一。”
    初一（3）班的最大问题是到课率不高和纪律不好。
    同学们不到校怎么办？毛主席说：“调查就是解决问题。”班内的积极分子、红卫兵和教师进行了家庭访问，发现同学们不到校的原因，大致有以下几种：主要是对复课闹革命认识不足，有的贪玩不愿到校，有的想参加工作不想上学，有的想多帮助家里做事情，有的家长怕孩子出外闯祸不让出来等等。针对这些情况，学校除向学生进行说服动员外，还开了家长会，得到家长的大力协助。后来，初一（3）班由原来每天到课人数二十五人左右，增加到了三十七人，达到百分之九十五。班内的纪律也有了很大的改进。
    我们学校复课闹革命以来，革命师生在思想上有很大收获。实践证明：实现班级革命大联合是复课闹革命的基础，而复课和教育革命又促进了班级大联合。
