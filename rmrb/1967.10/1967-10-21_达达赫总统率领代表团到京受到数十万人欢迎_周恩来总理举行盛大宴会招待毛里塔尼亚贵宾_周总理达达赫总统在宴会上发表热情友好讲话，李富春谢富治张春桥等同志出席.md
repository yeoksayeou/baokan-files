President Moktar Ould Daddah of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the delegation he led arrived in Beijing today. Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses in the capital warmly cheered "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania," enthusiastically welcoming the distinguished guests from Africa. President Daddah is visiting China at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Zhou Jianren, Deputy Minister of Defense Su Yu, and others went to the airport to welcome them.

Accompanying President Daddah on his visit to China were Minister of Foreign Affairs and Planning, member of the National Political Bureau of the People's Party, Bilani Mamadou Wane, member of the National Political Bureau of the People's Party, head of the Standing Committee, political secretary Ahmed Ould Mohamed Salah, special envoy of the Presidential Office, member of the National Political Bureau of the People's Party, Mohamed Abdallah Ould El Hassan, member of the National Assembly, general secretary of the Mauritania Workers' Union, Far Ma Li Ke, director of the Presidential Office, Abdel Aziz Saleh, economic and financial advisor to the Presidential Office, Moktar Ould Haiba, and Mauritania's ambassador to China, Mohamed Abdallah Ould Harish, among others.

Today, the streets of Beijing were filled with the atmosphere of friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania. From the Gate of the Nation to the Western Suburbs Guest House, a stretch of more than twenty miles, countless red flags fluttered in the wind. Giant banners reading "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania" and "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Mauritania people" were hung high in the sky. Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses in the capital, holding high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of President Daddah of Mauritania, and the national flags of both countries, lined up on both sides of the streets, warmly welcoming the friends from Africa.

At 11 o'clock sharp, the special plane carrying President Daddah landed at the capital airport, where the Chinese and Mauritania national flags were flying. The airport was immediately filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and the welcoming crowd waved the national flags of both countries, enthusiastically shouting, "Warmly welcome President Daddah of Mauritania!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania!" President Daddah stepped off the plane, and Premier Zhou Enlai warmly shook hands with President Daddah and others, warmly welcoming them to visit China. A team of vigorous Red Guards presented "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the Mauritania friends and read aloud the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories and give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles."

After the orchestra played the national anthems of Mauritania and China, President Daddah, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, inspected the honor guard of the People's Liberation Army of China and the militia and Red Guards. Then, President Daddah walked towards the welcoming crowd to meet with people from various sectors of the capital. The revolutionary masses of the capital, who have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, filled with internationalist friendship, waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted repeatedly: "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Mauritania people!" "Firmly support the anti-aggression struggle of the Arab people!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Down with imperialism headed by the United States!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" People also enthusiastically pinned golden Mao badges on the chests of the Mauritania guests. The Mauritania friends waved their hands frequently, greeting the welcoming crowd.

President Daddah, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, left the airport by car and headed to the city center to receive the welcome of hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses lining the streets. When President Daddah, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, arrived in an open-top car at the spacious Tiananmen Square, a moving welcome scene appeared here. Seven large red balloons soared into the sky. A troupe of several thousand Red Guards, in the midst of enthusiastic cheers and deafening drumbeats, performed songs and dances praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for the Mauritania friends, such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helm" and "Being a Little Red Guard of Chairman Mao."

Those who went to the airport to welcome the guests today also included leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in the capital, leaders of various departments of the government, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, as well as China's ambassador to Mauritania, Lü Zhixian. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, who went to Shanghai to welcome the guests, accompanied President Daddah to Beijing.

Staff of the Mauritania Embassy in China and envoys of various countries to China also went to the airport to welcome the guests.

This morning, when President Daddah and the Mauritania delegation he led departed from Shanghai, leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, leaders of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, and leaders of other relevant departments went to the airport to see them off.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on October 20, Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly and solemnly welcome President Moktar Ould Daddah of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the delegation he led.

Premier Zhou Enlai and President Daddah delivered warm and friendly speeches at the banquet (full text see page 3). Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Xie Fuzhi, Deputy Director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and leader of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee Zhang Chunqiao, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, and Zhou Jianren, Deputy Minister of Defense Su Yu, leaders of various departments of the government and the People's Liberation Army, representatives of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary mass organizations in the capital, attended the banquet.

Premier Zhou first spoke at the banquet. He, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, extended a warm welcome to President Daddah.

Premier Zhou said, the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism has closely united the peoples of China and Mauritania. Our friendship is based on the opposition to the aggressive and war policies of imperialism, and it is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mauritania in 1965, our friendly and cooperative relations have developed satisfactorily.

Premier Zhou said, Chairman Mao Zedong has said, "No matter how large or small a country is, it has its own strengths and weaknesses." The Chinese people and the Mauritania people are friends and brothers in the revolutionary family of Asia and Africa. We should learn from each other and help each other. We believe that President Daddah and the Mauritania friends' visit to China will greatly enhance the friendship and mutual understanding between China and Mauritania, and make new contributions to strengthening the unity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the struggle against imperialism.

President Daddah then spoke. He expressed his thanks for the warm welcome given by the Chinese government and the Chinese people. He said, our visit will help to further strengthen the already very friendly relations between our two countries, so that the cooperation that has started smoothly can continue to develop.

President Daddah said, Mauritania watches with great sympathy the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of their wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong in their development and progress. He said, socialism has opened a gap for imperialism, which has not yet been disarmed and is becoming more brutal with the approach of its doomsday, and China is achieving new leaps in consolidating socialism through an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

President Daddah talked about the wish to strengthen the unity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said, it is with this spirit that we Mauritanians have come from afar to strengthen the friendly relations between our people and the great revolutionary people of China through practical actions.

Those attending the banquet also included China's ambassador to Mauritania, Lü Zhixian. Staff of the Mauritania Embassy in China and envoys of various countries to China were also invited to attend the banquet.

Red flags lined Tiananmen Square, drums and gongs resounded, and revolutionary masses and Red Guards in the capital sang and danced, warmly welcoming the Mauritania guests.
