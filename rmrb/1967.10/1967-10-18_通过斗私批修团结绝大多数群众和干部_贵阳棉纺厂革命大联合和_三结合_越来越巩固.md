Through struggling against self and criticizing revisionism, unite the majority of the masses and cadres
The revolutionary great alliance and "three-in-one combination" at Guiyang Cotton Mill are increasingly consolidated

98 percent of the workers in the entire mill have participated in the revolutionary great alliance, and 95 percent of the cadres have been liberated. The situation of revolution and production is flourishing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: The proletarian revolutionary factions of Guiyang Cotton Mill, which was the first in the country to implement revolutionary great alliance by administrative department, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. With "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, they have consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the great criticism. Now, 98 percent of the workers in the entire mill have participated in the revolutionary great alliance. 95 percent of the cadres have been liberated, among whom 21 have been elected into the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership group, and 11 revolutionary leading cadres have taken up the posts of chairman or vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee of the mill or workshop. The entire mill presents a flourishing new situation of revolution and production.

The revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination at Guiyang Cotton Mill have been further consolidated and developed in the great criticism. The main experience is that they have grasped the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to expose, criticize, and struggle against revisionism, and to struggle against the "self" in one's mind.

After the proletarian revolutionary factions at this mill won the power seizure struggle, they established the system of studying Chairman Mao's works that cannot be dispersed by thunderstorms from the work team, workshop, to the office. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres study before work, study before meetings, study every day, and the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works has become a common practice. After the instruction from Chairman Mao, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two major factions that are irreconcilable," was issued, the mill revolutionary committee acted promptly and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to strengthen the political and ideological education of all revolutionary workers in the mill. The leading members of the mill revolutionary committee and the responsible persons and revolutionary masses of the revolutionary mass organizations of various workshops, work teams, and offices participated in the study classes in batches. They took Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" as the main teaching materials, and the editorials of the "Red Flag" magazine and "People's Daily" as the study guidance materials. They studied and exposed their thoughts, made self-criticisms, and educated themselves.

After implementing the great alliance by administrative department, there was a period when, due to the mischief of "self," some responsible persons of revolutionary organizations regarded themselves as "old rebels," and the erroneous ideas of "only I am revolutionary" were relatively serious. They did not pay attention to uniting the masses and cadres who had not yet participated in the revolutionary great alliance, and the revolutionary great alliance in the mill could not be rapidly developed. Through study, they deeply realized that to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, they must first make a revolution in the depths of their souls, smash the "self," and establish the "public." Only by uniting the majority of the masses who had previously taken the wrong side or were in an intermediate state, can the proletarian revolutionary factions better seize power and use power; only then can they more powerfully isolate and strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry out the great criticism thoroughly. Therefore, many responsible persons of the grassroots revolutionary mass organizations, after study, actively went to do ideological work for those comrades who had not yet participated in the revolutionary great alliance due to being deceived, helping them solve ideological problems, raise class consciousness, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, through a series of political and ideological work by the revolutionary mass organizations, the revolutionary great alliance in the entire mill has developed in organization and consolidated in thought.

The purpose of the proletarian revolutionary factions uniting is to thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with Liu Shaoqi as the chief representative, and to criticize revisionism deeply and thoroughly in politics, ideology, and theory. Therefore, after the proletarian revolutionary factions at this mill united, they first thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's reactionary bourgeois line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" in the cadre issue. They seriously analyzed the situation of the cadres in the entire mill and believed that the majority of the cadres in the entire mill are good or relatively good and should be united. They should unite the majority of the cadres and the majority of the masses in the great criticism, strengthen the revolutionary ranks, and enhance the power of the great criticism. To help the cadres who made mistakes stand up and revolutionize, the proletarian revolutionary factions actively helped them study Chairman Mao's works with problems in the great criticism, study the relevant editorials and important articles of the "Red Flag" magazine and "People's Daily," expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi's reactionary bourgeois line. At the same time, they deeply touched their souls, examined their past mistakes in implementing the reactionary bourgeois line, and drew a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Through the great criticism, the cadres stood up one after another and fought together with the proletarian revolutionary factions. The proletarian revolutionary factions, according to Chairman Mao's instruction of "believing in and relying on the majority of the cadres" and "not only looking at the cadres' one-time and one-event, but also looking at the cadres' entire history and entire work," absorbed them into the revolutionary great alliance team in different situations, and some were absorbed into the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership group, and some were arranged with appropriate work. These revolutionary cadres, after standing up, played a great role in promoting the revolution and production of the entire mill.

Through practice, the proletarian revolutionary factions at this mill deeply felt that only by overthrowing the "self" in their minds could they criticize the revisionist line implemented by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road deeply and thoroughly, and consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

"Revolution is the locomotive of history." With the revolution well grasped, production has also presented an unprecedented new situation. The revolutionary workers in the dyeing and finishing workshop have successfully carried out 11 major technological innovations in just a few months, solving the technical problems that had not been solved before. They not only improved the product quality but also completed the September production plan of dyed cloth 10 days ahead of schedule. The entire mill's fine spinning machine and weaving machine operation rates have both created the highest records since the establishment of the mill.

　　通过斗私批修团结绝大多数群众和干部
　　贵阳棉纺厂革命大联合和“三结合”越来越巩固
    全厂百分之九十八的职工参加了革命的大联合，百分之九十五左右的干部解放出来，革命和生产出现欣欣向荣的新局面。
    据新华社贵阳电　全国最早按行政部门实行革命大联合的贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在革命的大批判中，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命的三结合。现在，全厂百分之九十八的职工参加了革命的大联合；已有百分之九十五左右的干部解放出来，其中有二十一名干部被选入革命三结合领导班子，十一名革命领导干部担任了厂或车间革命委员会的主任委员或副主任委员。全厂革命和生产呈现出欣欣向荣的崭新局面。
    贵阳棉纺厂的革命大联合和革命的三结合能够在大批判中进一步巩固和发展，主要的经验是，他们狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在对修正主义进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争中，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争取得胜利以后，从班组、车间到科室，都建立了雷打不散的学习毛主席著作的制度。革命群众和革命干部，班前学，会前学，天天学，活学活用毛主席著作已蔚然成风。毛主席的“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”指示下达以后，厂革委会闻风而动，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，加强对全厂革命职工的政治思想教育。厂革委会领导成员和各车间、班组、科室革命群众组织的负责人和革命群众，分期分批地参加了学习班的学习。他们根据厂里新老干部和群众中的活思想，以毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等著作为主要教材，以《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》社论等为学习辅导材料，边学边亮思想，多作自我批评，自己革自己的命，自己教育自己。
    这个厂在实行按行政部门大联合以后，有一段时间，由于“私”字作怪，一些革命组织负责人的以
  “老造反派”自居，“唯我革命”等错误思想比较严重，不注意团结尚未参加革命大联合的群众和干部，厂里革命大联合不能迅速发展。他们通过学习，深刻认识到，要巩固和发展革命大联合，必须首先在灵魂深处闹革命，大破
  “私”字，大立“公”字。无产阶级革命派只有把绝大多数过去站错队或处于中间状态的群众团结拢来，才能更好地掌好权，用好权；才能更有力地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把革命大批判搞深、搞透。因此，许多基层革命群众组织的负责人，在学习以后，主动下去做那些因受蒙蔽而尚未参加革命大联合的同志的思想工作，帮助他们解决思想问题，提高阶级觉悟，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。在毛主席的最新指示的鼓舞下，经过革命群众组织的一系列的政治思想工作，全厂的革命大联合，组织上发展了，思想上更巩固了。
    无产阶级革命派联合起来的目的，就是为了彻底打倒以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上把修正主义批深批透。因此，这个厂的无产阶级革命派联合起来后，首先彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。他们认真地分析了全厂干部的情况，认为全厂绝大多数干部是好的或者比较好的，是应该团结的。应当在革命的大批判中团结干部的大多数和团结群众的大多数，壮大革命队伍，增强革命大批判的力量。为了帮助犯错误的干部站起来革命，无产阶级革命派在大批判中，积极帮助他们带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，学习《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论和重要文章，启发他们大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。同时，狠触灵魂，检查自己过去执行资产阶级反动路线的错误，与党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界线。通过革命大批判，干部纷纷回到毛主席的革命路线上来，同无产阶级革命派一起战斗。无产阶级革命派根据毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数”，“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，分别不同情况，吸收他们参加革命大联合的队伍，有的吸收参加革命三结合的领导班子，有的安排了适当的工作。这些革命干部站出来以后，对全厂的革命和生产起了很大推动作用。
    通过实践，这个厂的无产阶级革命派深刻体会到，只有把自己头脑里的“私”字斗倒，才能把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行的修正主义路线批深批透，才能巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    “革命是历史的火车头”。革命抓好了，生产也出现了从未有过的新局面。印染车间的革命职工在短短的几个月中搞成功十一项较大的技术革新，解决了过去一直未解决的技术难题，不仅提高了产品质量，而且提前十天超额完成九月份的色布生产计划。全厂细纱机和织布机开台率，都开创了建厂以来的最高纪录。
