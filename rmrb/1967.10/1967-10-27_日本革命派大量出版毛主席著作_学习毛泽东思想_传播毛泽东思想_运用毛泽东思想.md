Japanese revolutionary factions have recently published a large number of Chairman Mao's works to facilitate the Japanese people's active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and to popularize contemporary Marxism-Leninism's peak—Mao Zedong Thought.

	According to a report by the New China News Agency on October 26, the Tokyo-based Dongfang Bookstore has recently published "Selected Themes from Mao Zedong's Works."

	The first volume of the selected themes includes "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "The May Fourth Movement," "Reform Our Study," "Oppose Party Tribalism," "After Reading 'Adversity Turned to Good Fortune' and a Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe," "The United Front in Cultural Work," "Talk with the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily," and "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," totaling 18 articles.

	The second volume of the selected themes includes the "Three Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thought," "Oppose Liberalism," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "The General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's Order to Reissue the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and "The Working Methods of the Party Committee," as well as some articles published by the "Liberation Army Daily" on studying the "Three Articles." The third volume of the selected themes includes four philosophical works: "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?"

	According to a report by the New China News Agency in Tokyo, in the context of the revolutionary fervor of the Japanese people actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and successfully fighting against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, the Japanese Sato government, and the revisionist group led by Miyamoto serving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the Tokyo Chinese Bookstore has recently published the second volume of the "Mao Zedong Collection" in Japanese.

	This book collects three brilliant works by Chairman Mao: "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," "Introduction to a Cooperative," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" It also includes guiding materials published by the "Liberation Army Daily" on studying Chairman Mao's "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China."

	The cover page of the second volume of the "Mao Zedong Collection" features Chairman Mao's quote: "Every Communist must understand this truth: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'" Additionally, each article is prefaced with a quote from Chairman Mao.

	The Tokyo Chinese Bookstore previously published the first volume of the "Mao Zedong Collection" in July, which includes Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

	Recently, the Dongfang Bookstore in Japan has also published two volumes of selected readings of Chairman Mao's works in Japanese. Following the publication of the Japanese version of "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" in May, the Dongfang Bookstore has edited and published the second and third volumes of selected readings of Chairman Mao's works.

	The newly published second volume of selected readings of Chairman Mao's works includes eight brilliant works: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thought," "Oppose Liberalism," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "The General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's Order to Reissue the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and "The Working Methods of the Party Committee." The third volume of selected readings of Chairman Mao's works includes four brilliant philosophical works: "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?"

	The cover of the second volume of selected readings of Chairman Mao's works features Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important directive: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."
