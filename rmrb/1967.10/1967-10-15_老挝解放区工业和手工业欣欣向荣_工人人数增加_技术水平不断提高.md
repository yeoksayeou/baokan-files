The people in the liberated areas of Laos, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, are fighting against the aggression and indiscriminate bombing by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys while striving to develop industrial and handicraft production. The number of workers is increasing, and their technical skills are improving.

The liberated areas of Laos have already established many factories, including forging plants, textile mills, rice mills, printing plants, pharmaceutical factories, and automobile repair shops.

The Central Forging Plant can now produce some automobile parts.

The pharmaceutical factory can now produce thirty-five kinds of medicines, and the quality is good.

Textile, blacksmithing, and weaving handicrafts have also developed significantly.

The Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee is guiding the planting of cotton in various places, restoring the silk and textile industries in Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, Xieng Khouang, and Xam Neua provinces, and establishing textile training classes for the Laotian and Lahu ethnic groups. This allows the mountain people to master textile techniques, spin yarn, and weave cloth to achieve self-sufficiency. In addition to the Central Textile Mill, each province has established handicraft textile mills.

Furthermore, Xieng Ngeun Province successfully produced white sugar for the first time this year.

　　老挝解放区工业和手工业欣欣向荣
　　工人人数增加　技术水平不断提高
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝解放区人民，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，一面抗击美帝国主义及其走狗的侵犯和狂轰滥炸，一面努力发展工业和手工业生产。工人人数在增加，工人的技术水平在提高。
    老挝解放区已经建立起锻冶厂、纺织厂、碾米厂、印刷厂、制药厂、汽车修理厂等许多工厂。
    中央锻冶厂还能生产部分汽车零件。
    制药厂现在能制造三十五种药品，质量也很好。
    纺织、锻铁和编织等手工业也有了很大的发展。
    老挝爱国战线党中央有计划地指导各地种植棉花，恢复琅勃拉邦、丰沙里、会晒、川圹等省的缫丝业和纺织业，并且为寮听、寮松族同胞开办纺织训练班，让山区人民掌握纺织技术，自己动手，纺纱织布，自给自足。除了中央纺织厂外，各省都建立起手工纺织厂。
    此外，桑怒省今年第一次成功地制出了白砂糖。
