Firmly Implement Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions: "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revisionism" as the Main Task
Strive to Hold Good Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes

The entire nation's military and civilians are earnestly studying the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Xining region, determined to take the "Old Five Articles" as the main content for study, use criticism and self-criticism as the method, adhere to the principle of self-education and self-liberation, combine military and political training, and make the study classes better and better.

Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: After the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes by the "August 18" Joint Committee of the Party, government, and mass organizations in Qinghai Province was published, it attracted great attention from revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country. Many regions' revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and revolutionary mass organizations held meetings to study and promote this experience. They expressed their determination to firmly carry out the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revisionism" as the main task, strive to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, be heroes in criticizing self, be pioneers in repudiating revisionism, further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," conduct a deeper revolutionary great criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation within the unit, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great instruction to "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism." The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses across the country acted immediately, firmly carrying out and implementing the instruction. Taking "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revisionism" as the main task and universally holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a major strategic measure to promote the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In recent days, revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations in various provinces and cities have made decisions to open study classes. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been universally established across the country. After the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Xining region was published, the broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary factions expressed their determination to learn and promote this experience well, make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes better, and make the entire country a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing, with great interest, studied and discussed the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Xining region. The responsible person of the revolutionary mass organization of the Beijing Stamp Factory said, "Our factory's second Mao Zedong Thought study class is about to begin. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings on the method and attitude of study, promote the advanced experience of the Xining region, and make our study class good. The more than 500 students of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by the Workers' Congress, Peasants' Congress, and Red Guards' Congress in Pinggu County, Beijing suburbs, studied and discussed the experience of the Xining region in combination with their own situations. They said, "Holding 'three-in-one combination' study classes is good. With revolutionary leading cadres studying together with us and comrades from the People's Liberation Army helping us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, we can better solve ideological problems and promote the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary 'three-in-one combination.' They immediately decided to mobilize all students to earnestly study the experience of the Xining region, revise their own study plans, and determine to make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes better. Revolutionary workers of the Revolutionary Headquarters of Workers in Shandong said, "The experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Xining region is very good. They turned the study class into a battlefield of 'Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revisionism.' We should also, like the comrades in the Xining region, insist on the method of self-education, truly achieve: in study, fearlessly expose one's own erroneous thoughts, fearlessly fight one's own selfishness, fearlessly correct one's own mistakes and shortcomings, and through study, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind. The students of the provincial-level Party, government, and mass Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province and the preparatory personnel of the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the 69000th Unit of the People's Liberation Army and the preparatory group of the Revolutionary Committee of Hunan Province believe that the Mao Zedong Thought study class held in the Xining region insists on the principle of self-education and self-liberation, prominently reflects the great leader Chairman Mao's consistent teaching of believing in the masses and relying on the masses, inherits and carries forward the glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and earnestly studies these experiences, which is of great significance to holding good Mao Zedong Thought study classes at various levels. They immediately studied these experiences and supplemented and revised their own study plans, implementing them in action. The Red Guard revolutionary youngsters in many schools in the Wuhan region also expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revisionism" as the main task, quickly establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes at various levels of school, department, and class, take the "Old Five Articles" as the main content for study, use criticism and self-criticism as the method, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and in the great struggle to achieve revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," conduct a good revolutionary great criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation within the unit, and achieve new merits.

The broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guizhou, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions expressed that they would definitely learn from the five experiences of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Xining region, and make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in their regions and units better. The members of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Shanghai Radio Factory No. 7, No. 8, and Shanghai Electric Meter Factory, etc., expressed that they would learn from the good experience of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Xining region combining political training with military training, launch a wave of learning from the People's Liberation Army, better learn from the People's Liberation Army's outstanding tradition of emphasizing proletarian politics and insisting on the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, enhance revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and forge our ranks into a strong proletarian revolutionary force. The revolutionary mass organization leaders' Mao Zedong Thought study class held by 34 factories including Tianjin Color Weaving Factory No. 6, Regulating Valve Factory, and Telecommunications Mold Factory immediately took action after learning from the experience of the Xining region, adding military training to the study content. The comrades attending the full meeting of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee earnestly studied and discussed the experience of the Xining region and issued a notice to learn from the experience of the Xining region. The responsible comrades of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee emphasized that the Mao Zedong Thought study class held in the Xining region adopts the "three-in-one combination," combines political and military training, combines internal and external, and self-education, and carries forward the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. We must earnestly learn from it and continuously summarize and improve, making the Mao Zedong Thought study classes better and better.

Some comrades in the Party and mass systems of the direct-affiliated organs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in combination with their own experiences of opening study classes in their units, unanimously agreed that the "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought study class is an innovation. It can make revolutionary leading cadres receive more help from revolutionary masses and comrades from the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly break down the "self" in their minds. At the same time, revolutionary youngsters also have the opportunity to directly learn revolutionary excellent traditions and experiences from revolutionary leading cadres and comrades from the People's Liberation Army who support the left, thereby developing and consolidating the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters of Zhejiang Province and some responsible comrades of affiliated revolutionary mass organizations expressed that they would learn from the experience of the "three-in-one combination" in the Xining region, change the past practice of some units studying separately, and insist on frugal study, saving for revolution, turning the study class into an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style study class.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army earnestly studied the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Xining region and expressed their determination to take "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revisionism" as the main task, hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and do a better job in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work. The comrades of the leadership organs of the Beijing Military Region, who are preparing to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, linked the reality, studied the experience of the Xining region, revised and enriched the plan for holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and made meticulous arrangements for the guiding principles, content, and methods of study. The soldiers and officers on the military training front line at Zhejiang University said, "The revolutionary comrades in the Xining region have inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of our army teaching the people, the people teaching the army, and the army and people teaching and learning from each other. We will definitely learn from the good experience of the comrades in the Xining region, hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and raise the military training work to a new level." The soldiers and officers of the Qingdao garrison and those assisting the proletarian revolutionary factions to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the front lines of the "three supports" and "two militaries" in various places expressed that they would definitely learn from and apply the experience of the Xining region well, helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes.
