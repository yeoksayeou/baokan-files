The Soviet revisionist clique is pushing forward with "economic reforms," implementing the so-called "new system" of profit as the guiding principle, and is comprehensively restoring capitalism within the country. After Soviet industrial enterprises implemented the "new system," "material incentives" have been elevated to the most important position. They vigorously advocate that material incentives are "the driving force of social development," are "the source of increased labor productivity," and are "the guarantee for the promotion of advanced technology." They regard material incentives as "one of the basic policies for increasing workers' remuneration." To promote "material incentives," they have issued numerous reward regulations.

However, what kind of people benefit the most from implementing this new method of "material incentives" and establishing various bonuses? According to Soviet revisionist publications, in some enterprises that have implemented the so-called "new system," bonuses are only given to engineering and technical personnel, while workers either do not receive bonuses or receive much less. For example, in the Shishmorsk Lead-Zinc Combined Enterprise and the Balkhash Mining and Metallurgical Combined Enterprise, the bonuses given to engineering and technical personnel and staff account for 10 to 13 percent of their wage fund, while the bonuses given to workers at the same time only account for 0.6 percent. In the Voskresensk Cement Plant, in 1966, 40 percent of the material reward fund was allocated to workers, while 60 percent was allocated to the minority of engineering and technical personnel. For instance, in the Volgograd "Red October" Factory in 1966, the total bonuses received by engineering and technical personnel were double that of the workers, and the bonuses for the factory directors and managers were even higher. They not only receive high bonuses but also enjoy high salaries and various allowances. The bonuses received by some enterprise managers are even 150 times higher than those of ordinary workers. Meanwhile, the broad masses of workers have to complete stringent quotas to receive a meager amount of bonuses, otherwise, their wages will be deducted.

    苏修集团推行利润挂帅的“新体制”
    奖金养肥了企业中的特权阶层
    苏修统治集团大搞“经济改革”，推行利润挂帅的所谓“新体制”，在国内全面复辟资本主义。苏联的工业企业实行“新体制”之后，“物质刺激”更被提高到头等重要的地位。他们大肆宣扬什么物质刺激“是社会发展的动力”，是“提高劳动生产率的源泉”，是“推广先进技术的保证”，把物质刺激作为“提高工人劳动报酬的基本方针之一”。为了推行“物质刺激”，他们颁布了名目繁多的奖励条例。
    然而，实行这种新的“物质刺激”方法，设立多种奖金，究竟对什么人最有利呢？据苏修报刊透露，一些实行所谓“新体制”的企业，只发给工程技术人员奖金，而不发给工人奖金，就是发，也少得多。例如，在石山口铅锌联合企业和巴尔喀什采矿冶金联合企业，发给工程技术人员和职员的奖金占其工资基金的百分之十到十三，而同时发给工人的奖金只占百分之零点六。在沃斯克列辛斯科水泥厂，一九六六年物质奖励基金的百分之四十分配给工人，百分之六十分配给只占少数的工程技术人员。又如伏尔加格勒“红十月”工厂一九六六年工程技术人员所拿奖金总数比工人所拿奖金总数高出一倍，厂长、经理之流的奖金就更多了。他们不仅拿高奖金，还享有高工资、各种附加费。有的企业负责人所得的奖金甚至高于一般工人的一百五十倍。而广大工人要得到为数甚微的奖金，却要完成苛刻的定额，否则还要扣除工资。
