A new call to arms has sounded on the educational front!

The latest directives from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on the resumption of classes and the revolution in primary, secondary, and tertiary education have been issued! The new call to arms for the Cultural Revolution on the educational front, led by the proletariat, has resounded loudly!

We are engaged in an extremely glorious and great endeavor that our predecessors have never undertaken. The crucial task of resuming classes and making revolution is to thoroughly smash the old bourgeois educational system and teaching content, and to create a brand-new proletarian educational system and teaching content. This is a matter of great importance for the socialist and communist cause, a matter of great importance for the next hundred, thousand, and ten thousand years. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have entrusted us with such a great mission, which is the highest honor for the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff on the educational front. Of course, to accomplish this mission, the difficulties are immense, and the struggle is arduous. For example, there are no ready-made experiences, and no established paths to follow; we must explore and forge ahead ourselves. Difficulties are apparent. The key question is: what attitude should we adopt towards these difficulties? Should we wait for higher authorities to provide solutions? No! Because all leadership experiences and methods come from the masses. Should we wait for others to come up with experiences? No! Because if everyone waits for others to come up with experiences, experiences would have to fall from the sky or grow from the ground, which is impossible. There is only one way: follow Chairman Mao's words, "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and taste it yourself." Go to practice, teach while reforming. We must, in the practice of teaching, implement Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, gradually propose plans for the revolution of the educational system and teaching content. We have in our hearts the reddest sun—Chairman Mao, and before us the brightest lamp—Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely overcome all difficulties, surmount all obstacles, and achieve the brilliant and dazzling victory goal at the fastest speed. (Jiefang Daily, October 21 editorial)

### 教育战线上新的进军号响了！

    教育战线上新的进军号响了！
    毛主席和党中央关于大、中、小学校复课闹革命的最新指示下达了！教育战线无产阶级文化大革命新的进军号，嘹亮地吹响了！
    我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。这场复课闹革命的重要任务，就是彻底摧毁旧的资产阶级教育制度和教学内容，创建崭新的无产阶级教育制度和教学内容。这是社会主义、共产主义事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。毛主席和党中央把这样一个伟大的使命付托给我们，是我们教育战线革命师生员工的无上光荣。当然，要完成这项使命，困难是很大的，斗争是很艰巨的。譬如没有现成的经验，没有现成的路可走，而必须由我们自己去探索，去闯。困难，是明摆着的。问题的关键在于我们应该用什么态度去对待这些困难！坐等上级拿办法来，行吗？不行！因为任何领导的经验和办法都是从群众中来的。坐等人家出经验，行吗？不行！因为如果大家都坐等人家出经验，经验就只好从“天”上掉下来，“地”里长出来，而这是不可能的。办法只有一个：听毛主席的话，“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”到实践中去，一边教学，一边改革。我们要在教学的实践中，贯彻毛主席的教育革命思想，逐步提出教育制度和教学内容的革命方案。我们心中有一个最红最红的红太阳——毛主席，我们的面前有一盏最亮最亮的明灯——毛泽东思想，我们一定能排除一切困难，克服一切险阻，用最快的速度，达到光芒四射、灿烂夺目的胜利目标。（解放日报十月二十一日社论）
