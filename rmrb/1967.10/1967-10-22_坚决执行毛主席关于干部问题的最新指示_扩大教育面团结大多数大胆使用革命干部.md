The entire nation, both military and civilian, enthusiastically acclaims the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. They express their determination to carry forward and develop our Party's glorious tradition of handling cadres, and to support more revolutionary cadres in stepping forward to assume leadership roles.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 21st, today's issue of the People's Daily published an editorial titled "Correctly Implementing Chairman Mao's Cadre Policy," and the 20th issue of the People's Liberation Army Daily published an editorial titled "Addressing Cadre Issues Starting from Education." These editorials convey our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary tripartite combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. This issue must be resolved."

Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and the broad ranks of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically acclaimed this and are earnestly studying and discussing it, determined to implement Chairman Mao's instructions in action. They say: Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues are a beacon guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from victory to victory.

Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses in the capital express their determination to resolutely and swiftly implement Chairman Mao's recent series of extremely important instructions on cadre issues. Workers at the Beijing Third Steel Rolling Mill said, since January this year, we have followed Chairman Mao's teachings to trust and rely on the majority of cadres, invited revolutionary leading cadres to participate in various levels of production leadership teams, helped cadres who made mistakes return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and ensured the implementation of the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better. In the future, we will follow Chairman Mao's instructions, further unite and educate cadres, boldly use cadres, and give full play to the core and backbone role of revolutionary cadres. Red Guards at Beijing Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the direction for us to further address cadre issues starting from education. We will better unite and rely on revolutionary cadres. For those who have made mistakes, we will observe and help them correct their mistakes, allowing them to be tested and tempered in the great storms of class struggle.

Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary cadres, through the practical struggle of seizing and holding power, deeply realized: to form a genuine revolutionary tripartite combination and establish a temporary power organ with proletarian authority, it is necessary to have revolutionary cadres with rich experience in struggle, strong organizational and work capabilities, and high policy levels to participate. In the past few months, Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary cadres have held multiple sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, allowing cadres at various levels to participate in batches, significantly improving the cadres. The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Corporation and its 20 affiliated factories and enterprises have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthened political and ideological work among cadres, and allowed a large number of revolutionary cadres, including some who made mistakes but have sincerely corrected them, to participate in the temporary power organs of the revolutionary tripartite combination at various levels. Red Guards studying at the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Shanghai's colleges and universities said, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, our minds are clearer, and our eyes are brighter. We must remove all ideological obstacles, expand the scope of education, unite the majority, and resolutely and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee has taken a series of measures to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. In the past two days, the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been holding an experience exchange meeting on cadre work in the Xining region. At the meeting, revolutionary cadres from some units introduced good experiences of breaking private interests and correctly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy; some leading cadres who participated in the revolutionary tripartite combination also shared their experiences of correctly treating themselves and the mass movement. They expressed that they will do as Chairman Mao says. They will definitely take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, grasp the key issue of correctly treating cadres, do a good job in the revolutionary tripartite combination, consolidate the revolutionary great alliance, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. On the 20th, the provincial and municipal organs in the Guiyang region held a meeting with 7,000 participants to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre line. Li Li, deputy director of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said, the proletarian revolutionary cadres must deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues, correctly treat cadres, and boldly use revolutionary cadres. The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically helped revolutionary cadres during the Cultural Revolution, boldly supported their work, and allowed more than 90% of the middle-level and above cadres to step forward, promoting the revolution and production of the entire factory. The leader of the Jinan General Command of the Revolutionary Headquarters of the Revolutionary Workers of Shandong said, the practical struggle of the Cultural Revolution has proven that the better the cadre work of a unit, the more consolidated the revolutionary great alliance of that unit, the deeper the revolutionary great criticism, and the better the production. We revolutionary workers must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number" of the Chinese Khrushchev on cadre issues, unite the majority of cadres, boldly use cadres, and give full play to the role of revolutionary cadres. Workers at the Harbin Car Factory said, Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues are the most brilliant and correct. We study and apply Chairman Mao's works, correctly treat cadres, unite with revolutionary cadres to do revolution, truly realize the revolutionary tripartite combination, revolutionary leading cadres play their core and backbone role, promote the revolutionary great alliance, revolutionary great criticism, and struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire factory, and the factory completes the state's production plan in excess every month. The Joint Headquarters of the Proletarian Revolutionary Cadres of the Shanxi Xishan Mining Bureau recently held a cadre study class. Revolutionary workers and cadres studied Chairman Mao's works together, struggled against selfishness and criticized revisionism together, effectively promoting the ideological transformation of cadres. They said, we will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, carry forward and develop the glorious tradition of handling cadres during the Yan'an Rectification Movement, and support more revolutionary cadres to step forward to assume leadership roles.

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Gansu said, correctly treating and resolving cadre issues is a major matter related to carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The warriors of the Red Flag Headquarters of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee's organs follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, implement the policy of "punishing the past and curing the future, treating the illness and saving the person" for cadres who made mistakes, and actively help cadres who made mistakes return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The leader of the revolutionary mass organization of the Tianjin Automobile Repair General Factory said, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, liberate the vast majority of middle-level and above leading cadres. Recently, we have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, invited cadres to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helped cadres who made mistakes to consciously revolutionize, correctly treat the mass movement, and correctly treat themselves, achieving good results. The revolutionary cadres of Chengdu Dongfanghong Paper Factory expressed their determination to correctly treat cadres from the fundamental interests of the revolution, firmly unite with the broad revolutionary cadres, and fight together to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution. Many factories, enterprises, organs, and schools in Wuhan have established special teams for cadre work, strengthened the education of cadres who made mistakes, and promoted the revolutionary tripartite combination.

The broad ranks of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries" express their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. The warriors of the unit where Li Wenzhong, who sacrificed his life to rescue revolutionary youngsters, said, we will, with the spirit of Li Wenzhong's care for the proletarian revolutionary cadres, care for revolutionary cadres, and help the proletarian revolutionary cadres correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. The warriors of a certain unit executing the left-support task in the Qingdao Steel Plant, through patient and detailed ideological work, helped the proletarian revolutionary cadres achieve results in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy. The warriors said, revolutionary cadres are the precious wealth of the Party and the people. We will, with class feelings, help the proletarian revolutionary cadres do a better job in cadre work and achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
