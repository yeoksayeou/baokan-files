The autumn session of the China Export Commodities Fair, scheduled to open on November 15 in Guangzhou, has been fully prepared. With the strong support of the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, this session of the fair is welcoming guests from all over the world with a new look and more abundant content.

Held in the midst of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, this autumn session of the fair reflects the new and great achievements of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on both the ideological and material fronts. Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has truly mobilized hundreds of millions of people in our country. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated on an unprecedented scale, and the spiritual face of the Chinese people has undergone tremendous changes, transforming into boundless material force. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country have actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," displaying boundless enthusiasm and achieving one victory after another. This year, agricultural production in our country has achieved a bumper harvest for the sixth consecutive year, and industrial production has brought continuous good news. The market is bustling, thus providing a solid material foundation for this autumn session of the fair.

A responsible person from the fair said with full confidence that the upcoming fair will be a new and abundant one. No matter how the domestic and foreign reactionaries try to sabotage our reputation, no matter what tricks they play to obstruct the holding of the fair, they will surely meet with thorough failure. As Chairman Mao teaches us: "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defames us, and says we are utterly worthless, that is even better. It proves not only that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great success." The proletarian revolutionaries in the national foreign trade system and the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in the Guangzhou region have displayed a high degree of proletarian revolutionary spirit, and in a short period of time, they have made the preparations for the fair better than ever before, with higher standards and better quality. Many new products and models and recorded pictures reflecting the latest scientific and technological achievements of our country vividly illustrate the heroic feats created by the Chinese people under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

A responsible person from the fair said that business people from various countries are paying close attention to the holding of this autumn session of the fair. After the invitations were sent out, many replies have been received every day recently, expressing their determination to participate in the fair.

    中国出口商品交易会已筹备就绪
    正以崭新面貌迎接世界各地来宾
    新华社广州二十八日电　预定于十一月十五日在广州开幕的今年秋季中国出口商品交易会已经筹备就绪。在广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的大力支持下，这一届交易会，正以崭新的面貌和更加丰富的内容，迎接世界各地的来宾。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下举办的今年秋季交易会，体现了我国广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在精神和物质两个战线上所取得的新的巨大成就。一年多来，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把我国亿万群众真正发动起来，毛泽东思想得到了空前未有的大普及，全国人民精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，并且变为无穷的物质力量。全国广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，奋发起冲天干劲，取得了一个又一个的胜利。今年我国农业生产获得了连续第六年的丰收，工业生产胜利捷报不断传来，市场繁荣，从而为今年秋季交易会提供了良好的物质基础。
    交易会有关负责人满怀信心地说，即将开幕的交易会是一次面貌崭新、内容丰富的交易会。不管国内外反动派以什么方式破坏我国信誉，不管他们施展什么阴谋来阻挠交易会的举行，都必将遭到彻底的失败。正如毛主席教导我们的：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”全国外贸系统的无产阶级革命派和广州地区的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，发扬了高度的无产阶级革命精神，在较短的时间内把交易会筹办得比过去更好，具有更高的水平、更高的质量。许多新商品和反映我国科学技术最新成就的模型、纪录图片，生动地说明了我国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗创造出来的英雄业绩。
    交易会有关负责人说，各国贸易界人士对今年秋季交易会的举行十分关注。交易会邀请书发出后，最近每天都收到许多复信，他们表示一定参加交易会。
