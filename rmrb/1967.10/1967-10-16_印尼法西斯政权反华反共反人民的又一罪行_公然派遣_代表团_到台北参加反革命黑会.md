The Indonesian fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution, in another anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people crime, openly dispatched a "delegation" to Taipei to participate in a counter-revolutionary black meeting.

New China News Agency, October 15th: According to reports from Jakarta, the Indonesian fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution recently openly dispatched a "delegation" to Taipei to join the already despised Chiang Kai-shek bandits in a meeting organized by U.S. imperialism, the "World Anti-Communist League" and the "Asian Anti-Communist League." This is another piece of evidence of the Indonesian fascist military regime's mad hostility towards the Chinese people and its increasing collusion with the public enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek. It is also a great exposure of its ugly, anti-communist, anti-people face.

According to a report by the Indonesian official mouthpiece, the Antara News Agency, on the 12th, the leader of this "delegation," the veteran anti-communist Gochali, returned to Jakarta from Taipei a few days ago. He shamelessly said that the anti-communist, anti-China clowns attending the "World Anti-Communist League" and the "Asian Anti-Communist League" meetings expressed "great trust" in the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and "admired" its two years of mad anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people, and bloody cleansing of the Thousand Islands. Gochali shouted: "Communism must be eliminated from all aspects of Indonesian national life."

According to a report by the Chiang bandit's "United Daily News" on September 29th, Gochali made a speech in Taipei to the Chiang bandit's reporters, extolling the "friendly relations" between the Indonesian fascist military regime and the Chiang bandits.

He said that the Indonesian fascist military regime is "willing" to "approach" the Chiang bandits because it regards them as "true friends." He also shouted that establishing diplomatic relations with the Chiang bandits is just a matter of time. He bluntly admitted that at that time, Indonesia and the Chiang bandits "joining hands to fight communism would be more justified."

According to reports, in Taipei, Gochali was elected as the chairman of the "World Anti-Communist League" and a member of the executive committee of the "Asian Anti-Communist League." He is also the chairman of the Indonesian branch of the "Asian Anti-Communist League."

　　印尼法西斯政权反华反共反人民的又一罪行
　　公然派遣“代表团”到台北参加反革命黑会
    新华社十五日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，最近公然派遣“代表团”到台北同早已被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石匪帮一道，参加了由美帝国主义策划召开的“世界反共联盟”和“亚洲反共联盟”会议。这是印尼法西斯军人政权疯狂敌视中国人民、加紧同中国人民公敌蒋介石勾结的又一罪证，也是它的反共、反人民的丑恶面目的大暴露。
    据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社十二日报道，这个“代表团”的头目、反共老手戈查利几天前从台北返回雅加达。他恬不知耻地说，出席“世界反共联盟”和“亚洲反共联盟”会议的反共、反华小丑们，对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权“表示很大的信任”，并对它两年来疯狂反共、反华、反人民，血洗千岛之国的法西斯行径“表示钦佩”。戈查利叫嚷：“应当从印度尼西亚国家生活的各个方面清除共产主义。”
    据蒋帮《联合报》九月二十九日透露，戈查利在台北对蒋帮记者发表讲话，大肆宣扬印尼法西斯军人政权同蒋帮的“友好关系”。
    他说，印尼法西斯军人政权“乐意”同蒋帮“接近”，因为它把蒋帮看做是“真正的朋友”。他还叫嚷，印尼法西斯军人政权同蒋匪帮“建交只是时间问题罢了”。他露骨地供认，到那时，印尼同蒋帮“携手反共，就更为名正言顺了”。
    据报道，在台北，戈查利被选为“世界反共联盟”总主席和“亚洲反共联盟”执行委员会委员。他也是“亚洲反共联盟”印度尼西亚分会总主席。
