The imperialists of the United States and the Soviet revisionist leadership are currently engaged in intense black-market dealings in the United Nations regarding the Middle East issue. The recent series of new war provocations by the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, against Arab countries are directly supported and encouraged by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists.

At the time when Israel was continuously provoking war against the United Arab Republic, on the 24th, Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban held a secret meeting with U.S. President Lyndon Johnson in Washington. On the same day, the U.S. State Department publicly announced the resumption of arms supplies to Israel. Eban brazenly declared in Washington that day that Israel would maintain the "existing actual situation" of occupying large tracts of Arab land and would not return to the "situation" before the June war.

Regarding Israel's new war provocations, the Soviet revisionist group hypocritically expressed "condemnation" and on the 24th evening, proposed a motion in the UN Security Council to "condemn" Israel. However, the Soviet revisionists quickly exposed their true colors by abandoning their original proposal the very next day. The UN Security Council, manipulated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, passed a "resolution" on the 25th, calling on the relevant countries to "immediately stop" all military activities without distinguishing right from wrong. This resolution, supported by both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, not only once again affirms the status quo of Israel's occupation of Arab lands but also intentionally encourages the Israeli aggressors to continue their provocations.

In recent periods, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have been taking advantage of the opening of the 22nd session of the United Nations General Assembly to engage in intense backroom dealings on the Middle East issue. On October 12th, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk claimed that the U.S. and the Soviet Union's clandestine activities in the Middle East were "making real progress" and that the U.S. and the Soviet Union were "working very hard." Subsequently, the Soviet revisionist group specially dispatched Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov to New York for activities. Rusk, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Arthur Goldberg, Kuznetsov, and Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Dobrynin held frequent secret meetings in Washington and New York.

According to Western news agencies, the purpose of this round of U.S.-Soviet talks was to implement the secret agreement reached by Johnson and Kosygin during their Glassboro meeting in June this year on the Middle East issue: to force Arab countries to accept a series of humiliating conditions in exchange for the withdrawal of Israeli invasion forces from the occupied areas. These conditions include recognizing the existence of the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, agreeing to Israel's occupation of more Arab land, guaranteeing "free navigation" through the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran, and so on. Under the direction of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, a series of backroom negotiations are currently underway in the United Nations, aiming to draft a proposal to send a UN special representative to the Middle East to specifically implement the U.S.-Soviet plan. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are exerting heavy pressure on Arab countries both domestically and internationally to force them to accept this dirty deal.

From the United Nations' black-market dealings to Israel's new war provocations, a common thread runs through them all: the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to force Arab countries to submit. However, the criminal activities of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists will undoubtedly arouse even stronger opposition from the peoples of the Arab countries.

### 一面支持和纵容以色列发动挑衅　一面在联合国密谋反革命诡计  美苏狼狈为奸妄图压阿拉伯国家屈服

    一面支持和纵容以色列发动挑衅　一面在联合国密谋反革命诡计
    美苏狼狈为奸妄图压阿拉伯国家屈服
    新华社二十七日讯　美帝国主义和苏修领导集团正在联合国就中东问题加紧进行黑市交易。美帝侵略工具以色列最近不断对阿拉伯国家进行新的战争挑衅就是美帝和苏修直接支持和纵容的结果。
    在以色列接连对阿联进行战争挑衅之际，以色列外长埃班二十四日在华盛顿同美国总统约翰逊秘密会谈。同一天，美国国务院公开宣布恢复对以色列供应军火。埃班当天在华盛顿嚣张地叫嚷，以色列要保持侵占阿拉伯国家大片领土的“现有的实际状况”，“将不回到”六月发动战争以前的“那种局面”。
    对于以色列的新的战争挑衅，苏修集团假惺惺地表示“谴责”，二十四日晚在联合国安理会提出了一个“谴责”以色列的提案。但是，苏修很快就自己揭穿了它对阿拉伯国家假支持的原形，到第二天就抛弃了它原来的提案。美苏操纵下的联合国安理会在二十五日通过了一项“决议”，不分是非地要有关各国“立即停止”一切军事活动。美苏共同支持的这项“决议”，不仅是又一次肯定以色列侵占阿拉伯国家领土的现状，而且是蓄意纵容以色列侵略者继续进行挑衅。
    最近一个时期，美帝同苏修利用第二十二届联合国大会开会的机会，一直在紧张地就中东问题进行幕后交易。美国国务卿腊斯克十月十二日声称，美苏在中东问题上的阴谋活动“正在取得真正的进展”，美苏“是很努力地进行工作的”。接着，苏修集团又专门派遣副外长库兹涅佐夫到纽约活动。腊斯克、美国驻联合国代表戈德堡同库兹涅佐夫、苏联驻美大使多勃雷宁等，在华盛顿和纽约频繁密商。
    据西方通讯社透露，美苏举行这次会谈是为了策划实现约翰逊和柯西金在今年六月间葛拉斯堡罗会谈中就中东问题达成的秘密协议：要阿拉伯国家接受一系列丧权辱国的条件，以换取以色列侵略军从他们侵占的地方撤走；这些条件包括承认美帝侵略工具以色列的存在，答应以色列侵占阿拉伯国家更多的领土，保证苏伊士运河和蒂朗海峡的“自由通航”等等。在美苏的指挥下，目前正在联合国进行着一连串的幕后谈判，目的是要拟订出一个提案，派遣联合国特别代表去中东具体贯彻美苏方案。美帝和苏修为了迫使阿拉伯国家接受它们的这套肮脏交易，正在联合国内外对阿拉伯国家施加重重压力。
    从联合国的黑市交易，到以色列的新的战争挑衅，就是贯穿着这样一条美苏阴谋迫使阿拉伯国家屈服的黑线。但是美帝和苏修的罪恶活动，势必激起阿拉伯各国人民更加强烈的反对。
