Shanghai No. 1 Department Store's proletarian revolutionary factions resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, boldly and extensively use revolutionary cadres, and let them play the core and backbone role in various levels of revolutionary committees, thereby consolidating and strengthening the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and powerfully promoting the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-reform of the store.

Shanghai No. 1 Department Store's proletarian revolutionary factions, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "believe in and rely on the majority of cadres," after seizing power in the January Revolution, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the cadres in their unit, believing that the vast majority of them are good or relatively good, and that their mistakes are internal contradictions among the people. Some cadres, although their mistakes are relatively serious, still have the determination to correct their mistakes. Based on this analysis, the store's proletarian revolutionary factions believe that they must unswervingly implement the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," and help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The store's proletarian revolutionary factions, in the process of criticizing the reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" fabricated by China's Khrushchev on cadre issues, pushed the cadres to the forefront of the revolutionary criticism to "show their faces," and did a great deal of ideological and political work, releasing forty-nine out of the fifty cadres in the store. Before the establishment of the revolutionary committee in July, they again, in response to the thoughts of some people who were "not at ease, not trusting, and not satisfied," organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues and related articles in newspapers, making the broad revolutionary masses further understand that: whether or not to boldly believe in, rely on, and use revolutionary cadres is an important sign of whether or not to adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; to establish a revolutionary committee with proletarian authority to lead the revolution and production of the entire store, it is necessary to have revolutionary cadres participate and let them shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production with the proletarian revolutionary factions.

After reaching a consensus, the proletarian revolutionary factions fully followed the mass line, arranged appropriate work for each cadre according to their specific situations. Among the forty-nine cadres who have been released, twenty-seven have been absorbed into the three-in-one leadership teams at the store level, as well as the commodity department and office level. The original Party secretary of the store took charge of the store revolutionary committee, and twelve other cadres respectively took charge as the main committee members or deputy main committee members of various department revolutionary committees.

After arranging the work for the revolutionary cadres, the proletarian revolutionary factions of this store paid great attention to encouraging and helping cadres to build new achievements and establish new labor records in the midst of revolution and production. They believe that revolutionary leading cadres have rich experience in struggle, are politically mature, have strong organizational abilities, and are familiar with business work. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these cadres have undergone new tempering and testing and will definitely become stronger. Their shortcomings are that they are deeply influenced by old thoughts, accept new things slowly, and some cadres still have heavy mental burdens. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary factions adopted the method of "using, observing, learning, and helping" for the cadres, firmly believing in and boldly using revolutionary cadres, caring for their thoughts and work, learning from their strengths, and helping them correct their shortcomings and mistakes. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the proletarian revolutionary factions, in response to the different degrees of shrinking back and fear of making mistakes among the cadres, organized the cadres to study Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and other brilliant works, actively encouraging the cadres to break private interests and establish public interests, and bravely shoulder the revolutionary burden. The revolutionary committee also held a revolutionary criticism study class for more than ten days, studying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing China's Khrushchev together with them, enthusiastically helping them recognize the good situation and arouse their revolutionary spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm.

The revolutionary cadres participating in various levels of revolutionary committees in Shanghai No. 1 Department Store always remember Chairman Mao's instruction: "You should put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." They consciously throw themselves into the mass struggle, leading the revolutionary masses of the entire store to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism together with the responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations. The cadres of the clothing department overcame their wrong thoughts about revolutionary criticism, bravely shouldered the revolutionary burden, and carried out revolutionary criticism with revolutionary workers, setting up the first revolutionary criticism column in the store. In solving the problem of how to closely combine the revolutionary criticism with the struggle-criticism-reform of the store, the revolutionary cadres also played their due active role.

    上海第一百货商店积极加强革命的三结合
    发挥革命干部的核心作用和骨干作用
    据新华社上海二十八日电　上海市第一百货商店无产阶级革命派坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，大胆放手使用革命干部，让他们在各级革命委员会中发挥核心作用和骨干作用，因而巩固和加强了革命的三结合，有力地推动了革命大批判和商店的斗批改。
    上海第一百货商店的无产阶级革命派，遵循伟大领袖毛主席提出的要“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，在“一月革命”风暴夺权以后，就对本单位的干部作了全面的分析，认为他们绝大多数是好的和比较好的，他们的错误还是人民内部矛盾。有的干部虽然错误比较严重，但是还有改正错误的决心。根据这种分析，商店的无产阶级革命派认为，必须坚定不移地执行“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    商店无产阶级革命派，在批判中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的过程中，就把干部推到革命大批判第一线去“亮相”，并且做了大量的思想政治工作，把全店五十名干部中的四十九名先后解放了出来。在七月份建立革命委员会以前，他们又针对部分群众存在的“不放心、不相信、不称心”的思想，再次组织大家学习毛主席关于干部问题的教导，以及报刊上的有关文章，使广大革命群众进一步明确了：能不能大胆相信革命干部、依靠和使用革命干部，是能不能坚持毛主席革命路线的重要标志；要建立起领导全商店革命和生产的有无产阶级权威的革命委员会，就必须有革命干部参加，让他们同无产阶级革命派一道挑革命、生产两副重担。
    认识统一以后，无产阶级革命派充分走群众路线，根据每个干部的具体情况，安排了适当的工作。在已经解放出来的四十九名干部中，被吸收参加店一级，以及商品部、科室一级三结合领导班子的，就有二十七名。商店原党委书记担任了店革命委员会的第一把手，还有十二名干部分别担任了各部革命委员会的主任委员或副主任委员。
    这家商店的无产阶级革命派在安排了革命干部工作以后，很注意鼓励和帮助干部在抓革命、促生产中建新功，立新劳。他们认为，革命的领导干部斗争经验比较丰富，政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强，业务工作比较熟悉。在文化大革命中，这些干部经受了新的锻炼和考验，一定会更加坚强。他们的缺点是旧的思想影响比较深，接受新事物比较慢，有的干部思想包袱还比较重。因此，无产阶级革命派对干部采取了“用、看、学、帮”的方法，对革命干部坚决相信，大胆使用，关心他们的思想和工作，学习他们的长处，同时帮助他们改正缺点和错误。在成立革命委员会以后，无产阶级革命派针对干部中存在着不同程度的缩手缩脚、怕犯错误的思想，组织干部学习毛主席的“老三篇”等光辉著作，积极鼓励干部破“私”立“公”，勇挑革命重担。革委会还举办了为期十多天的革命大批判学习班，同他们一道学习毛主席著作，一道批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，热情帮助他们认清大好形势，激发他们的革命斗志和革命干劲。
    上海第一百货商店参加各级革命委员会的革命干部，牢记毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”他们自觉地投身到群众斗争中去，同革命群众组织负责人一道，领导全店革命群众深入开展革命的大批判。服装部的干部克服了对大批判的错误思想以后，勇挑革命重担，同革命职工一道深入开展革命的大批判，办起了全店第一个革命大批判专栏。在解决开展革命大批判如何同商店的斗批改紧密结合起来这个问题上，革命干部也发挥了应有的积极作用。
