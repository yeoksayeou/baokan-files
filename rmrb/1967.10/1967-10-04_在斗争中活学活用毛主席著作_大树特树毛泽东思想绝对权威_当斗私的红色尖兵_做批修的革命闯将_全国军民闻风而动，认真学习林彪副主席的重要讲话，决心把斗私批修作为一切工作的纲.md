The broad masses of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country continue to earnestly study the extremely important speech given by our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. They have also studied the editorial article "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" published in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They enthusiastically acclaim the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and enthusiastically acclaim that our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and epoch-makingly developed Marxism-Leninism! The broad revolutionary masses have expressed that Vice Chairman Lin Biao's speech has conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country, pointing out the most important combat tasks at present. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself," closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and in the revolutionary criticism, combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of one's own unit. Consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform of one's own unit, completely criticize, expose, overthrow, and denounce the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high over every battlefield.

The revolutionary masses of Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Qinghai, and other places, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, continue to study and discuss Vice Chairman Lin Biao's extremely important speech and the article "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" after learning and discussing them. They excitedly say that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has achieved great decisive victories. We must thoroughly study and understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself," engrave Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. With these four characters as the guideline, we will achieve even more brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all other work. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant said, "We, the working class, must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and most resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great battle call of 'criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself.' We must grasp revolution and promote production, and carry out the revolutionary criticism more deeply and broadly. In the revolutionary criticism, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the 'self' in one's own mind, establish the 'public,' and specially uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought." In the afternoon of a certain day, the Beijing Agricultural Representatives Congress held a meeting and made the decision "to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of 'criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself,' and turn the suburbs of Beijing into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought." The decision calls on the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Beijing to take immediate action, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" as the guideline, carry out revolutionary criticism, develop and consolidate revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and turn the suburban villages of Beijing into a fiery red great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Broad revolutionary teachers and students have expressed that they will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great guideline of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself," study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, overcome all non-proletarian thoughts, learn from the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, and become strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the First Steel Plant, Love People Candy Factory, and the Fifth Loading Area of the Shanghai Port Authority have expressed that they will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, fiercely criticize the 'self,' and strongly criticize revisionism. They say, "'Self' is the deadly enemy of our proletarian revolutionary factions. If 'self' is not overcome, the root of revisionism in China cannot be uprooted; if 'self' is not overcome, we proletarian revolutionary factions cannot hold power well and use power well; if 'self' is not overcome, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev cannot be thoroughly overthrown." In the past period, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, as well as many revolutionary mass organizations, have successively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. After studying Vice Chairman Lin's extremely important speech, they decided to run the Mao Zedong Thought study classes better and study and apply Chairman Mao's works more effectively. On the morning of the third, the standing committee of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the responsible comrades of the Guizhou Military Region studied and discussed Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech and unanimously agreed that this speech is a great call issued by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, a programmatic document, and must be studied seriously, deeply understood, and resolutely implemented. On the morning of the third, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting of the standing committee, seriously studied and discussed Vice Chairman Lin's extremely important speech representing Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and studied the issue of universally establishing study classes. The meeting believed that the guideline of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao is a major guideline and the main task for all future work. The meeting summarized the experience of some regions in Shandong Province in establishing study classes and decided that the Provincial Revolutionary Committee and all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations across the province should take immediate action to establish study classes and quickly implement Chairman Mao's battle call of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" into action. The revolutionary workers of the Harbin Bicycle Factory have been holding six sessions of worker study classes on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works since March this year and have also held study classes for revolutionary cadres. After studying Vice Chairman Lin Biao's speech, they expressed that they must take "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" as the guideline, use Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the 'self' in one's own mind, overcome selfishness and establish public spirit; use Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, criticize, expose, overthrow, and denounce them, and make them never be able to rise again. The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Taiyuan Institute of Technology, the first university in Shanxi Province to achieve revolutionary great unity, joyfully expressed that they must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, while transforming the objective world, also transform their subjective world, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, deeply criticize the 'self' in their souls, establish a proletarian worldview, and specially uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, forever preserving revolutionary youth. The Red Guards of August 18 in Qinghai, after studying Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech, enthusiastically expressed that they must be vanguards and pioneers in the revolutionary criticism. At the same time, they must constantly struggle against the 'self' in their own minds, thoroughly eliminate all non-proletarian thoughts, and always prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideas.

The broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have been studying and discussing Vice Chairman Lin Biao's speech in recent days. They enthusiastically acclaim the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and express their determination to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest battle orders, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" as the guideline, further carry out revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform of one's own unit, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad revolutionary masses in various places have resolutely expressed that they will further implement Chairman Mao's great guideline of "grasp revolution and promote production," grasp revolution and vigorously promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, and rapidly improve our country's level of science and technology; resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," carry out military support activities on a larger scale, and learn from the great People's Liberation Army. They also expressed their determination to further consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of domestic and foreign class enemies.

According to the Xinhua News Agency on the third, the broad cadres and soldiers of the PLA Army, Navy, and Air Force, while celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, enthusiastically acclaim the extremely important speech given by our great leader Chairman Mao's close com-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao at the celebration in the capital. They have also studied the editorial article "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" published in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, and carried out extensive and in-depth studies. Everyone, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, expressed that they will resolutely respond to the great call recently issued by our great leader Chairman Mao to "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself," and immediately launch a new high tide of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself." They will use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to most resolutely strike at the 'self,' most fiercely attack the 'revisionism,' and focus on being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the 'loyalty.' In their minds, they will specially uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and make their greatest contributions to achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The various headquarters of the PLA, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, as well as the Navy, Air Force, and various branches, have some that convened party committee standing committee meetings overnight to seriously study and discuss Vice Chairman Lin's speech, and some that issued study notices to their subordinate units on the same day. The units in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Jinan, Shenyang, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and other places have some that held study meetings, and some that made decisions on seriously studying and implementing Vice Chairman Lin's instructions. Many units' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, after hearing the speech, rehearsed programs all day and rushed to sentry posts, docks, mountain fortresses, and fishing villages at night to convey the spirit of Vice Chairman Lin's speech to the cadres and soldiers and people of various ethnic groups. In Fuzhou, Kunming, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and other places, some units also recorded Vice Chairman Lin's speech and transmitted it to the cadres and soldiers on duty on the long border and coastal defense lines through various communication tools. Within a day and night, Vice Chairman Lin's speech was known to everyone in the army.

The cadres and soldiers of various units, while deeply studying Vice Chairman Lin's speech and the important article "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's great instruction of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" has great practical and historical significance. The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Air Force, Second Artillery, and various branches' leading organs believe that Chairman Mao's great instruction is the great guideline for us to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and the great guideline for the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country to further carry out revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and reform of one's own unit, and in the revolutionary criticism, constantly consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." They said, "Criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" are interrelated and inseparable. 'Self' is the core of the bourgeois worldview and the breeding ground for revisionism. 'Revisionism' is the inevitable result of the development of 'self.' Therefore, criticizing revisionism must involve criticizing and repudiating oneself, and criticizing and repudiating oneself must be combined with criticizing revisionism. If 'self' is not overthrown, Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principle on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot be truly understood, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group's various instructions and decisions cannot be firmly and unshakably implemented, the direction of the struggle cannot be firmly grasped, and the anti-revisionist struggle cannot be better carried through to the end. It is truly that "if 'self' is not overthrown, the country will not be preserved; if 'public' is in charge, the country will be secure." The responsible comrades of the leading organs of the Shenyang Army and the main leading cadres of their subordinate units, during the National Day period, spent three days together studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Vice Chairman Lin's speech. They expressed that they would resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and must combine revolutionizing others with revolutionizing oneself, be vanguards in criticizing and repudiating oneself, and pioneers in criticizing revisionism. The proletarian revolutionary factions of a certain unit of the General Staff Department deeply understood from their studies that "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" is a lifelong revolutionary direction for revolutionaries. They expressed that they must use Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself, live to an old age, struggle to an old age, reform to an old age, and revolutionize to an old age.

The broad cadres and soldiers, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Vice Chairman Lin's speech, especially emphasized that the key to the key, the root of the root, in carrying out "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself," is to study and apply the revolutionary treasure book of Chairman Mao's works in practice in the struggle, and specially uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind. The cadres and soldiers of the "Model Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Works" and the company where the good soldier of Chairman Mao Liu Yingjun was once stationed deeply felt from the practice of strengthening revolutionary construction in the company through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that the road of "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself" is the road of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice to achieve ideological revolutionization, the road of achieving the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the road of ensuring that our country's proletarian political power will never change color. They expressed that they must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice in "criticize and repudiate revisionism, and repudiate and reform oneself," and turn the company into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    据新华社三日讯　中国人民解放军陆海空军各部队广大指战员，在欢庆中华人民共和国成立十八周年的光辉节日里，热烈欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席在首都庆祝大会上的极为重要的讲话的发表，并且结合《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部文章《无产阶级专政下的文化大革命胜利万岁》，展开了广泛深入的学习。大家满怀革命豪情表示，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席最近发出的关于要斗私，批修的伟大号召，立即掀起一个“斗私，批修”的新高潮。要以毛泽东思想为武器，最坚决地向
  “私”字开刀，最猛烈地向“修”字开火，在无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“忠”字上狠下功夫，在头脑里大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面彻底的胜利，作出自己最大的贡献。
    解放军各总部、国防科委、国防工办，以及海军、空军和各兵种的领导机关，有的连夜召开党委常委会议，认真学习和讨论林副主席的讲话，有的当天就给所属部队下达学习通知。北京、上海、武汉、兰州、济南、沈阳、南京、广州、成都等地部队，有的召开了学习大会，有的作出了关于认真学习和贯彻林副主席指示的决定。不少部队的毛泽东思想宣传队，听到讲话后整日赶排节目，连夜赶往哨所、码头、山寨和渔村，向指战员和各族人民传达林副主席讲话的精神。在福州、昆明、内蒙古、新疆、西藏等地，有的部队还把林副主席的讲话录了音，通过各种通讯工具，传达给在漫长的边防海防线上执勤的指战员。一昼夜间，林副主席的讲话在全军已是人人皆知。
    各部队指战员在深入学习林副主席讲话和《无产阶级专政下的文化大革命胜利万岁》这篇重要文章时，一致认为，毛主席关于“斗私，批修”的伟大指示，具有伟大的现实意义和历史意义。空军、第二炮兵和各兵种领导机关的无产阶级革命派认为，毛主席的这一伟大指示，是指引我们把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大纲领，是指引全国无产阶级革命派进一步搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，在革命大批判中不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的伟大方针。他们说，斗私和批修是互相联系，不可分割的。“私”字是资产阶级世界观的核心，是产生修正主义的温床，“修”是“私”字发展的必然结果。因此，批修必须斗私，斗私要结合批修。“私”字不打倒，就不能真正理解毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，就不能坚定不移地贯彻毛主席、林副主席、党中央和中央文革的各项指示、决定，就不能牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把反修斗争更好地进行到底，真正是“私字不倒，江山不保；公字当家，江山才牢”。沈阳部队领导机关负责人和所属各部队主要领导干部，国庆节期间以三天时间在一起共同学习了毛主席最近的指示和林副主席的讲话。他们表示，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，一定要把革别人的命和革自己的命结合起来，当斗私的红色尖兵，批修的革命闯将。总参谋部某部无产阶级革命派从学习中深刻领会到，“斗私，批修”对革命者是一辈子的革命大方向。他们表示，一定要用毛泽东思想，狠狠斗私，批修，活到老，斗到老，改造到老，革命到老。
    广大指战员在学习毛主席最新指示和林副主席讲话时，特别强调指出，搞好“斗私，批修”，关键的关键，根本的根本，是在斗争中活学活用革命宝书毛主席著作，在头脑中大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。“学习毛主席著作模范红九连”和毛主席的好战士刘英俊生前所在连队的指战员们，从连队活学活用毛主席著作，加强革命化建设的实践中深深体会到，“斗私，批修”的道路，就是活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化的道路，就是夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利，保证我国无产阶级政权永不变色的道路。他们表示，一定要在“斗私，批修”中，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，把连队办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
