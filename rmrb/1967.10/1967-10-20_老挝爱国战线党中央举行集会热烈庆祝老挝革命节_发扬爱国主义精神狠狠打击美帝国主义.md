The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front holds a rally to warmly celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Lao Revolution Day

Carry forward the spirit of patriotism to resolutely strike back against American imperialism

	Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, October 19th — According to the Pathet Lao radio broadcast: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front held a grand rally on October 13th in a certain place in the liberated area of Sam Neua Province to warmly celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Lao Revolution Day (October 12th).

	Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and Vice Chairmen Sithon Kommadam and Phoumi Vongvichit, along with Central Committee members Sisana Sisane and others, attended the meeting.

	Attending the meeting were also Kan Suphanouvong, Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao National United Government, as well as representatives from the military, central government agencies, and various sectors of the people, totaling over 900 people.

	Sisana Sisane delivered the opening speech and read the call to action from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front.

	Prince Souphanouvong spoke at the meeting, highly praising the significant achievements of the Lao military and people in the anti-American national salvation war and the construction of the liberated areas. He pointed out: The liberated areas, which make up two-thirds of Lao territory, are constantly being consolidated and strengthened. The people in the liberated areas, who make up half of the Lao population, have truly become masters of their own land. This is a great and glorious victory for the Lao revolution and the Lao people.

	He said: "The victories we have achieved embody our determination to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys, and to build a peaceful, independent, neutral, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos."

	Prince Souphanouvong emphasized: "At present, American imperialism is strengthening and expanding its 'special war' in Laos. Our struggle will be more intense, and we will encounter more difficulties. However, our military and people will not retreat in the face of the enemy. The more vicious and barbaric American imperialism is, the more our military and people will hate it, the more they will carry forward the spirit of patriotism, and the more determined they will be to strike it down, making it suffer even greater defeats. We will not let the liberated areas be occupied, and we will not let our beloved motherland perish."

	All the representatives attending the rally unanimously expressed their determination to actively respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Prince Souphanouvong, and to launch attacks on the enemy from all fronts, thus completing the historical task of resisting America and saving the nation.

　　老挝爱国战线党中央举行集会热烈庆祝老挝革命节
　　发扬爱国主义精神狠狠打击美帝国主义
    新华社康开十九日电  据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会十三日在桑怒省解放区某地举行隆重集会，热烈庆祝老挝革命节（十月十二日）二十二周年。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，副主席西吞·库马丹和费当，老挝爱国战线党中央委员西沙纳·西山和其他中央委员出席了大会。
    出席大会的还有老挝民族团结政府卫生大臣兼代理外交大臣坎苏·高拉，以及军队、中央直属各机关和各界人民代表九百多人。
    西沙纳·西山在会上致开幕词，并宣读了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的号召书。
    苏发努冯亲王在会上讲话，热烈表扬老挝军民在抗美救国战争和建设解放区的事业中取得的重大成就。他指出：占老挝国土三分之二的解放区不断得到巩固和壮大，占老挝全国人口二分之一的解放区人民，真正成了自己土地的主人。这是老挝革命和老挝人民的极其重大和光辉的胜利。
    他说：“我们所取得的胜利体现了我们军民战胜美帝国主义及其走狗，建设一个和平、独立、中立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝的决心。”
    苏发努冯亲王强调说：目前，美帝国主义正在加强和扩大在老挝的“特种战争”，“我们的斗争将会更加激烈，我们将会遇到更多的困难。但是，我国军民决不会在敌人面前退缩。美帝国主义越凶恶、越野蛮，我国军民就越仇恨它，越高度发扬爱国主义精神，决心打击它，使它遭到更惨重的失败。我们决不让解放区被侵占，决不让亲爱的祖国沦亡。”
    参加集会的全体代表一致表示积极响应老挝爱国战线党中央委员会和苏发努冯亲王的号召，决心从各个方面向敌人发起进攻，从而完成抗美救国的历史任务。
