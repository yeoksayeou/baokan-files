Through the previous period of exploration, we have come to realize that to successfully carry out the policy of "resuming classes and making revolution," we must first believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and fully tap into the enthusiasm and creativity of revolutionary teachers, students, and parents.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes." After receiving the Party Central Committee's notice to resume classes and make revolution, we mobilized revolutionary teachers, students, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers' parents. With the spirit of economizing for the revolution, we took the initiative to repair desks and chairs, repaint walls, fix doors and windows, and mend parts of the ceiling. At the same time, we prepared Mao Zedong's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" according to the specific situations of different grades.

How to apply Mao Zedong's works in practice is the top priority after resuming classes. We convened a meeting with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers' parents, as well as revolutionary students, to discuss this. The parents of workers, peasants, and soldiers said: "Children need to read books, and the first book they should read is Chairman Mao's book; children need to gain knowledge, and the first knowledge they should gain is the knowledge of class struggle." They suggested that in the future, we should educate students to love Chairman Mao unconditionally. Whether it is language arts or arithmetic, we should lead with Mao Zedong Thought. They all said that educating students to never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the responsibility of revolutionary teachers in the Mao Zedong era. Based on the parents' opinions, the revolutionary teachers of our school also proposed a teaching method that combines lectures, self-study, discussions, reports, and experience-sharing meetings.

We deeply feel that although resuming classes and making revolution urgently requires overcoming a series of difficulties such as textbooks, classrooms, and desks and chairs, the decisive factor is people, not things. As long as people's thinking is correct, no matter how big or numerous the difficulties are, they can be overcome. Currently, the teachers, students, and parents of our school have a relatively clear understanding of the importance of resuming classes and making revolution and have an urgent demand for it. However, some teachers and students have the idea of "struggle, criticism, and transformation." In response to this active thought, we studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the Central Committee's instructions on resuming classes and making revolution with the students, making teachers and students clearly understand that "struggle, criticism, and transformation" is an expression of selfishness and that we must overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve class unity, and be pioneers in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism in education. At the same time, we convened a joint meeting of students, parents, and teachers, mobilizing revolutionary teachers, workers, peasants, and soldiers' parents, and revolutionary students to address active thoughts and do political and ideological work, making new contributions to the people in resuming classes and making revolution. Because the ideological issues were resolved relatively well, the material preparations for resuming classes and making revolution also progressed relatively smoothly.

Teachers focused on studying Mao Zedong's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, compiled temporary textbooks, and studied teaching reform plans. Everyone further realized through practice that if selfishness is not overcome, teaching principles and educational methods cannot be changed. Everyone called for the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction of "struggling against selfishness and revisionism," establishing the first Mao Zedong Thought study class, and a new high tide of carrying out the revolution and promoting educational reform is gradually forming in Caochang Primary School.

We are determined to forge ahead despite difficulties, continue to focus on "struggling against selfishness and revisionism," grasp the human factor, fully mobilize the masses, learn from students, learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers' parents, teach while carrying out educational revolution, thoroughly eliminate the influence of the revisionist educational line, and contribute to the establishment of a brand-new socialist educational system.

    读毛主席的书，长阶级斗争的知识
    北京市草厂小学　红战兵
    通过前一段的探索，我们体会到，要搞好复课闹革命，首先必须相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，充分发挥广大革命教师、革命学生、革命家长的积极性和创造性。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。我们接到党中央复课闹革命的通知后，就发动了革命教师、革命学生，以及广大工农兵学生家长，本着节约闹革命的精神，自己动手维修了桌椅，粉刷了墙壁，糊好了门窗，修补了部分顶棚。同时也按不同年级的具体情况，准备了毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》。
    如何活学活用毛主席著作，是复课以后的头等大事。我们召集了广大工农兵学生家长、广大革命学生一起来座谈。广大工农兵学生家长们说：孩子们要读书，首先是读毛主席的书；孩子们要长知识，首先是增长阶级斗争的知识。他们建议今后要教育学生无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，不论是上语文或是算术，都要用毛泽东思想挂帅。他们都说，教育学生念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是毛泽东时代革命教师的责任。根据家长们的意见，我校革命教师还提出了讲课、自学、讨论、报告会、讲用会相结合的教学方法。
    我们深深感到，复课闹革命，虽然急需克服教材、房屋、桌椅等一系列的困难；但决定性的因素是人不是物。只要人的思想认识对头了，再大再多的困难也是可以克服的。当前，我校教师、学生和家长对复课闹革命的重要意义，认识是比较清楚的，要求也是迫切的。但是，在一部分老师和学生中存在着“斗批走”的思想问题。针对这一活思想，我们和学生一起学习了毛主席最新指示，中央关于复课闹革命的指示，使师生们都明确认识到“斗批走”是“私”字的表现，必须破私立公，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，实现班级革命大联合，在斗私批修中当闯将，在教育革命中当先锋。同时我们还召开了学生、家长、教师联席会，发动广大革命教师、工农兵家长、革命学生，人人抓活思想，人人做政治思想工作，在复课闹革命中为人民立新功。由于思想上的问题解决得比较好，复课闹革命的物质准备工作进展得也比较顺利。
    教师们集中精力学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为指导，编选了临时教材，还研究了教改方案。大家在实践中进一步认识到，“私”字斗不倒，教学方针、教育方法改不了。大家纷纷发出开办毛泽东思想学习班的呼吁。我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“斗私，批修”的教导，把第一期毛泽东思想学习班创办起来了，抓革命、促教改的新高潮正在草厂小学逐渐形成。
    我们有决心迎着困难前进，继续以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓人的因素，充分发动群众，向学生学习，向工农兵家长学习，一边教学，一边进行教育革命，彻底肃清修正主义教育路线的影响，为创立崭新的社会主义教育制度而贡献力量。
