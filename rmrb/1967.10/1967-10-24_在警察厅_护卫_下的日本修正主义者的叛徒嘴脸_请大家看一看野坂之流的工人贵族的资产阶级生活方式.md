The People's Daily reports: On September 24, the Japanese newspaper *Chōshū Shinbun* dedicated its entire fourth page to an article titled "The Most Shameful Traitor of the Contemporary Era – The True Faces of Nosaka and Miyamoto, the Bourgeois Lifestyle of the Labor Aristocracy." The following is a summary:

The revisionist group led by Miyamoto Kenji and Nosaka Sanzo has, in less than a year, taken the shameful path of counter-revolution, anti-China, and anti-people. This is evident in their complete capitulation to the "peaceful revolution through parliament" line of the U.S.-Japan reactionary rulers. It is evident in their selling out to the traitorous reactionaries representing U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Sato government, and their mutual collusion as pawns in the anti-China plot under the banner of "independence and autonomy." It is evident in their opposition to all revolutionary actions of the Japanese and world peoples, and their constant sabotage and vilification of these actions. The Miyamoto revisionist group's so-called "expansion of party influence" activities, which betray the revolution and the people, are also on the verge of collapse, despite their use of the "two-legged" approach, spreading petty-bourgeois illusions on the one hand and wielding the whip of slavish organizational discipline on the other. They have already lost their leadership role.

The counter-revolutionary and anti-people true colors of the Miyamoto group have been fully exposed in the past year, both politically and ideologically. Their degeneration, both in degree and speed, has reached astonishing levels.

Why is this so? Why have they so quickly become counter-revolutionary traitors? This has already been politically exposed. Miyamoto Kenji and others have long lived a bourgeois lifestyle, indulging in bourgeois ideology, and have lost the will to make a revolution. They have become labor aristocrats content with the status quo of capitalist society. All they have is the desire to maintain their shameful labor aristocrat status, fearing revolution, fearing the people, fearing imperialism, and fearing war.

From the fragments of Miyamoto Kenji and Nosaka Sanzo's lives, we can also expose the corrupt and traitorous faces of these counter-revolutionary revisionists.

Nosaka, living a bourgeois life under the protection of the enemy regime:

1. Every election, Nosaka, under the guise of "nationwide canvassing" and "promoting party policies," embarks on feudal lord-like luxurious trips, spreading poison in various places. Behind Nosaka, there are always police from the Police Agency acting as his guards, shadowing him like a second skin. It is only with this protection that Nosaka feels his life is secure, ignoring the revolutionary people gathered around him, who are being surveilled and suppressed by the police. Ordinary voters cannot approach him.

2. During the Diet sessions, Nosaka often goes to the Diet. He is picked up and dropped off by the party's car. In the car, there is a police officer from the Police Agency assigned to the JCP as his guard. The party's secretaries, guards, and drivers are protected by reactionary spies and agents, yet they carry out "revolutionary activities" in the parliament.

3. At home, he notifies the police of the Tada district where he resides, saying, "I won't go out today," and when he goes out, he says, "I will go out at such and such a time." Nosaka's reason is, "If I don't notify them, they say they can't guarantee my safety, which is troublesome."

4. Nosaka's daily life is detached from the working-class and peasant masses, living a bourgeois life. His home has been renovated, expanded, and repainted every year recently, just like road construction in Tokyo. All this is done with party funds.

5. Inside the home, it is a typical bourgeois "modern life." Either a bell is rung or a button is pressed. Many small birds are kept, and he enjoys hatching chicks. There are also many varieties of cacti, and cacti are also popular in the party headquarters. He even promotes petty-bourgeois life to the service staff of the party headquarters, spreading poison.

6. A few years ago, he proposed a "weekly menu" in a weekly magazine and boasted about it, saying it was praised for its balanced nutrition. His daily diet is entirely bourgeois. It is worlds apart from the hardships of the working-class and peasant life.

7. Recently, he did something strange. He turned a study in his house into a thick iron door. Why? It is said that "if 'rioters' attack, hiding there can hold out for one or two hours." What a pathetic "revolutionary"! What a filthy character! This is the philosophy of survival for revisionists.

Nosaka Sanzo's Diet

This is part of the diet plan for Nosaka Sanzo, instructed by the Tokyo Secretariat when he went to Yamaguchi Prefecture to give a lecture last spring. The diet plan is divided into eight groups. Only two groups are introduced below.

Breakfast: One piece of sweet bread, a small amount of butter, one cup of milk, tea (with fruit syrup or sugar), vegetable and meat roll (40g egg, 3g oil, lettuce), French salad (50g crab, 10g lettuce, 50g tomato, 5g vinegar oil).

Lunch: One piece of bread (unsweetened), a small amount of butter, curry soup (50g potato, 10g carrot, 20g onion, 50g tomato, 30g pork, curry powder), stewed pumpkin (80g pumpkin, 5g sugar), stuffed bell pepper (one bell pepper, 30g onion, 30g beef, 5g egg), fruit (half a banana, one small mandarin orange), butter-fried vegetables (40g fried beans or cabbage, 2g butter, 3g vegetable oil), one cup of milk.

Dinner: One bowl of rice, Chikuzen dish (50g chicken, 40g carrot, 30g beans, 3g oil), soy sauce soup (20g soy sauce, 10g onion, 5g fried tofu, 13g dried fish), grilled salmon (one piece of dried salmon, shredded radish), tomato, fruit, sour cheese.

Breakfast: One piece of sweet bread, a small amount of butter, 10g jam, one cup of milk, lemon tea, mixed dish (30g cheese, 20g celery, 50g tomato, lettuce), fruit, orange water, sugar (wrapped in tin foil).

Lunch: One piece of sweet bread, a small amount of butter, one cup of milk, one cup of sour cheese, fruit, soup, fried fish, lettuce.

Dinner: One bowl of rice, fried pork, stir-fried vegetables, soy sauce soup, fruit, sour cheese, meat sauce noodles.

Nosaka's feudal lord-like "canvassing" can rival the emperor

From the actual situation of the "grand lecture" held in Yamaguchi Prefecture last year, we can see a side of the labor aristocrat life of the "Communist Party Chairman."

1. When Nosaka went to the prefecture to give a lecture, it was decided that after visiting his birthplace – Hagimachi – to pay respects at the grave, a member of the prefectural committee was called to Tokyo, and the Secretariat gave special detailed instructions. This included: Nosaka's daily meals, divided into eight groups. The defense team leader of the prefectural committee, who was responsible for Nosaka's lecture, allocated the meals to various regional committees day by day, and had the hotel where Nosaka Sanzo stayed prepare according to the meal plan.

What kind of meal plan is this? It is as introduced above. In the first-class hotels where Nosaka stayed, people were amazed, saying, "It surpasses the emperor."

2. The hotels where Nosaka stayed during his lectures were the highest class in the area. Taking the Kamefuku Hotel in Yamaguchi Prefecture as an example, this is a hotel with both Japanese and Western-style bathrooms and toilets, costing 9,000 yen per person per room (equivalent to 60 yuan – note by the People's Daily). During the lecture period, the last hotel he stayed in Hagimachi, Nosaka's guards said, "The emperor is already impressive. Our accommodation is almost like the emperor's!"

3. During the "canvassing" period, two guards, one secretary, one nurse, and two plainclothes police officers sent by the Police Agency followed him as "guards." In addition, a doctor was always brought along. Not to mention that to protect Chairman Nosaka, many "defense teams" were organized in the local prefectural and district committees, ensuring his safety day and night. To "prevent damage to the chairman's dignity and honor," it was required that party members assigned to the "defense teams" in various regions wear neat suits, tie ties, and dress properly, causing a sensation.

    在警察厅“护卫”下的日本修正主义者的叛徒嘴脸
    请大家看一看野坂之流的工人贵族的资产阶级生活方式
    本报讯　日本《长周新闻》九月二十四日用整个第四版刊登了题为《当代最可耻的叛徒——野坂、宫本的真面目，工人贵族的资产阶级生活方式》的文章，摘要如下：
    以宫本显治、野坂参三为头头的修正主义集团，在不足一年的时间里，眼看着就走上了反革命、反华、反人民的可耻的叛徒道路。
    它表现在完全投靠美日反动统治的“通过议会进行和平革命”的路线上。它表现在向代表美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和佐藤政府的卖国反动派卖身投靠，并相互呼应作为策划反华的走卒的“独立自主”的立场上。表现在反对一切革命的日本人民和世界人民的革命行动，并对此大泼冷水，疯狂咒骂，不断捣乱的言行上。背叛革命，背叛人民的宫本修正主义集团进行的虚张声势的“扩大党的势力”活动也摇摇欲坠行不通了，虽然他们采用“两条腿”走路的办法，一面散布天真的小资产阶级的幻想，一面积极挥舞奴隶主义组织纪律鞭子；但是，已经失掉了领导作用。
    宫本集团的这种反革命、反人民的修正主义真面目，在最近一年间从政治方面和思想方面已被揭露无遗。他们堕落的情况，无论在程度上，或在速度上，都达到了使人惊奇的程度。
    为什么这样呢？为什么这么快就堕落成反革命叛徒了呢？在政治上已经完全被揭露了。宫本显治等人长期以来过着资产阶级生活，迷恋资产阶级思想，已经丧失搞革命的意志，成了安于资本主义社会现状的工人贵族。他们有的，只是尽力维持自己的可耻的工人贵族地位，只是害怕革命，害怕人民，害怕帝国主义，害怕战争而已。
    从宫本显治和野坂参三生活的片断，也可以揭露他们这些反革命修正主义分子腐化堕落和叛徒的嘴脸。
  在敌人政权保护下过着资产阶级生活的野坂
    一、每次选举，野坂都以“全国游说”、“宣传党的政策”为名，进行封建诸侯式的奢侈旅行，到各地放毒。野坂的后面总有警察厅的警察作为护卫象影子似的跟着，野坂就是靠这个才感到自己的生命安全有保障，对于周围聚集来的革命人民，尽管被警察盯梢和镇压却不闻不问，普通的选民是不能靠近的。
    二、国会开会期间，野坂常常到国会去。用党的小汽车接送。在小汽车里坐着警察厅担任日共事务的警察作为护卫。党员的秘书、护卫和司机，受着反动派的间谍特务保卫，他们却在议会中进行“革命活动”。
    三、在家的时候，就用电话通知他所居住的太田区警察说“今天不出去”，出去时，就通知说“今天几点钟出去”。野坂的理由是“如果不通知，他们就说‘不能保证人身安全’，怪麻烦的”。
    四、野坂的日常生活是脱离工农群众的资产阶级生活。他的家，最近几年每年都要改修，增建，重新粉刷墙壁，真象东京修路一样来回摆弄。这些完全是用党费干的。
    五、家里面是地地道道的资产阶级“现代的生活”。不是按电铃，就是按电钮。养了很多小鸟，还以孵雏鸟为乐。仙人掌的种类也相当多，在党总部也流行栽种仙人掌。甚至向党总部的服务员鼓吹小资产阶级生活，散布毒素。
    六、在几年前的周刊杂志上提出了“一周的食谱”，并以被称赞为平均摄取营养办法好而自豪。他的日常饮食完全是资产阶级式的。与工农的困苦生活相差何止几万里。
    七、最近又搞了一起怪事。他家有个书斋，改换成厚铁门。为什么呢？据说是“‘暴徒’袭来时，如果躲在那里，可坚持一两个小时”。多么没有出息的“革命家”呀。多么肮脏的劣根性啊！这就是修正主义的活命哲学。
          野　坂　参　三　的　食　谱
    这是去年春天到山口县去讲演时，由东京书记处指示的野坂参三食谱的一部分。食谱共分八组。下面仅介绍其两组。
    早餐：甜面包一块，奶油少量，牛奶一杯，红茶（加果子露或砂糖），菜肉蛋卷（蛋四十克、油三克、生菜），法式色拉（蟹五十克、莴苣十克、西红柿五十克、醋油五克）。
    午餐：面包（不加甜味的）一块，奶油少量，咖喱汤（马铃薯五十克、胡萝卜十克、葱头二十克、西红柿五十克、猪肉三十克、咖喱粉），烩菜（南瓜八十克、砂糖五克），肉馅柿子椒（柿子椒一个、葱头三十克、牛肉三十克、蛋五克），水果（香蕉半根、小蜜柑一个），黄油炒菜（油煎扁豆四十克或油菜、黄油二克、植物油三克），牛奶一杯。
    晚餐：米饭一平碗，筑前菜（鸡肉五十克、胡萝卜四十克、扁豆三十克、油三克），酱汤（酱二十克、葱十克、油煎豆腐五克、鱼干十三克），烧鲑鱼（鲑干一块、碎萝卜），西红柿、水果、酸奶酪。
    早餐：甜面包一块，奶油少量，果子酱十克，牛奶一杯，柠檬茶，拼盘菜（干酪三十克、芹菜二十克、西红柿五十克、生菜），水果，桔子水，糖（用锡纸包装的）。
    午餐：甜面包一块，奶油少量，牛奶一杯，酸奶酪一杯，水果，汤，黄油炸鱼，生菜。
    晚餐：米饭一平碗，煎猪肉，炒菜，酱汤，水果、酸奶酪，肉酱细面条。
    野坂的封建诸侯式“游说”可与天皇比美
    从去年在山口县举办的“大讲演会”当时的实际情况，看看“共产党主席”的工人贵族生活的一个侧面。
    一、野坂到县里去讲演，决定包括到他的出生地——萩市去扫墓以后，就把县常委之一叫到东京来，由书记处作了特别细致的指示。其中包括：野坂每日三餐的食谱，共分八组。负责招待野坂讲演的县委员会防卫队长，把食谱按日分配给各地区委员会，要野坂参三所住的旅馆按食谱作好准备。
    这个食谱是什么样的东西呢？就象上面介绍那样。在野坂所住的一流旅馆中，都惊奇的认为“超过了天皇”。
    二、野坂讲演时住的旅馆都是当地最高级的。以山口县龟福旅馆为例，这是个有澡塘厕所的日西两式旅馆，一人一个房间要九千日元（折合人民币六十元——本报注）。在讲演期间最后住在萩市的旅馆中，野坂的警卫人员说：“天皇就够神气的了。我们的住处，几乎象天皇住的一样！”
    三、“游说”期间，护卫二人，秘书一人，女护士一人，其中还跟着警察厅派来的两名便衣警察作“护卫”，另外，到哪里都要带着大夫。更不用说，为了保护野坂“主席”，在当地县、区委员会中组织很多“防卫队”，不分昼夜地“保证人身安全”的事情了。“为了使主席的体面和尊严不受损失”，要求各地区担任“防卫队”的党员，穿漂亮的西服，扎好领带，“服饰端正”，搞得轰动一时。（文中小标题是原有的）
