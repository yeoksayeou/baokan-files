Comrade Zhou Enlai's Important Speech at the Mass Rally in Wuhan Welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation

Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech at the mass rally in Wuhan welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation on October 9 is as follows:

Dear Comrade Muá¸§amed Shehu, Dear Comrade Ramiz Alia, Dear Comrades of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, Comrades, Revolutionary Comrades, and Friends:

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation, led by Comrade Shehu, has come to our country with deep revolutionary sentiments from the heroic Albanian people to conduct a friendly visit. Over the past few days, the delegation has visited Jinan, Qingdao, Dazhai, Taiyuan, Yan'an, and now they have gathered in Wuhan. We once again extend our most sincere and warmest welcome to them.

Comrades and Revolutionary Comrades:

I want to share with you a piece of great news. Comrades Shehu, Alia, and the entire Albanian Party and Government Delegation have come to Wuhan at the special invitation of our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has invited them to personally see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. Comrades Shehu and Alia also wanted to come and see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution here. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, and support for the proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses in Wuhan.

Wuhan is a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. Our great leader Chairman Mao has many times sailed the Yangtze River here, breaking waves and surging forward. The proletarian revolutionary forces in Wuhan have always followed Chairman Mao in advancing through storms and waves. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have undergone new tests. Today, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Wuhan are holding a grand rally to welcome comrades from Albania, who are on the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. We feel particularly close and extremely excited.

The glorious Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has always held high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and resolutely opposed imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

After the end of World War II, a new revisionism emerged in Europe. First, the Tito renegade clique appeared in Yugoslavia. Then, in the Soviet Union, which has a glorious tradition of the Great October Revolution, the Khrushchev revisionist clique emerged. Many leaders of communist parties in various countries also degenerated into modern revisionists. The Albanian Labor Party was the first in Europe to raise the banner against revisionism. It fearlessly opposed strong forces, dared to face difficulties and isolation, remained unyielding, and waged an uncompromising struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership and the Tito renegade clique.

When the Soviet Union and other socialist countries were changing or were about to change their colors, the Albanian Labor Party insisted on the dictatorship of the proletariat and continued to follow the socialist path. To prevent the growth of revisionism and to counter the encirclement by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, the Albanian Labor Party recently took a series of major revolutionary measures: opposing bureaucratism, promoting atheism, liberating women, advocating spiritual incentives, narrowing the gap between high and low wages, reducing private plots and livestock, achieving full cooperation in agriculture, developing mountainous areas to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, having cadres participate in manual labor, implementing a cadre rotation system, nationalizing the militia, and bringing guns and hoes onto the stage of literature and art, etc. The Albanian comrades have been implementing these measures in the revolutionary movement with great determination and swift action, and there are many aspects worth learning from.

The Albanian Labor Party is one of the youngest communist parties in Europe. However, it adheres to the truth, is full of vitality, and makes continuous progress. It has made great contributions to the defense and development of Marxism-Leninism and to the world revolutionary cause. The fifth congress of the Albanian Labor Party held at the end of last year pushed the socialist revolution and socialist construction in Albania to a new high, established new merits for the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, and made the red flag of revolution in Albania even more brilliant. The dialectics of history is like this: as long as one grasps the truth, one can surpass others.

Chairman Mao, in his telegram to the fifth congress of the Albanian Labor Party, highly praised: "Heroic Albania, a great socialist beacon in Europe. The Soviet revisionist leadership, the Tito clique, and all kinds of renegades and scabs, compared to you, are nothing but a handful of yellow earth, while you are a mountain towering into the clouds." The Chinese people are deeply proud to have such a great ally as Albania.

The glorious Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, adheres to the revolutionary line of seizing power by force of arms and, in the class struggle at home and abroad, relies on the broad masses to continuously develop and strengthen the people's armed forces to defend the fruits of the revolution.

From the moment of its birth, the Albanian Labor Party has led the Albanian people to wage armed struggles, opposing the Italian-German fascist occupiers and traitors. When some "parliamentary fools" in Europe were preparing to surrender to the enemy to seek a position in the post-war bourgeois government, the Albanian Labor Party led the Albanian people to firmly grasp the gun, rely on their own strength to liberate the motherland, and support the anti-fascist struggles of the Greek and Yugoslav peoples. Since liberation, the Albanian Labor Party has led the Albanian people to hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, continuously strengthening national defense and vigilantly guarding the socialist motherland. The historical experience of the Albanian Labor Party once again proves the great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries are trying every means to subvert and occupy Albania. Recently, the Greek royalist fascists have come to power and are eyeing Albania, attempting to invade. Comrade Hoxha, at the fourth congress of the Democratic Front held in September, issued a stern warning to American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Greek royalist fascists, pointing out that if they dare to venture into Albania, they will suffer severe punishment. We fully support the solemn position expressed by Comrade Hoxha on behalf of the Albanian people. We believe that the heroic Albanian people, with their rich tradition of armed struggle, maintain high revolutionary vigilance and are full of fighting spirit, are invincible.

The Albanian people are not isolated. All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world stand with Albania. Although China and Albania are thousands of miles apart, our two parties and peoples are always fighting side by side. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries must count China and Albania together.

The glorious Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has always held high the banner of proletarian internationalism and implemented a revolutionary foreign policy.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of imperialism led by the United States, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, resolutely support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. The proletarian internationalist spirit of Albania has won universal praise from revolutionary people around the world, making Albania enjoy high international prestige.

American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the peoples of the world. Ending the aggression and oppression of American imperialism is a common task for the peoples of the world. The Vietnamese people are at the forefront of the armed struggle against American imperialism, tying down a significant portion of American imperialism's strength and dealing a heavy blow to its aggressive arrogance. To isolate and strike American imperialism to the greatest extent, we must establish the broadest possible international united front against American imperialism and its running dogs. This united front cannot include modern revisionism, which colludes with American imperialism and betrays the interests of the peoples of various countries, centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, but it must unite all anti-American forces that can be united. As long as we continue to consolidate and expand the anti-American united front and persist in the struggle, then, no matter how modern revisionism serves it, the day when the peoples of the world defeat American imperialism will surely come sooner.

Comrades and Revolutionary Comrades:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victories. Billions of people have truly been mobilized. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated as never before. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with Liu Shaoqi as their representative, have been exposed. The power they usurped has been returned to the hands of the proletariat. The revolutionary situation across the country is excellent.

The situation in the Wuhan area is also excellent, just like the rest of the country. More than two months ago, there were dark clouds and the enemy was rampant for a while. Now, the enemy has collapsed, and the proletarian revolutionary forces are surging forward, breaking waves and advancing. The development of the revolutionary situation in the Wuhan area vividly proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's judgment that "chaos has two aspects" and "bad things can be turned into good things."

Now it is clear: wherever there is chaos, it is either stirred up by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, or it is caused by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, or enemy spies who have not been reformed and are secretly causing trouble. At the same time, the existence and influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology in society also provide soil for the enemy to stir up trouble and carry out sabotage. We do not advocate chaos, but if the enemy insists on creating chaos, there is nothing to be afraid of. They are lifting stones to drop on their own feet. Through this chaos, the enemy has completely exposed their true faces. This has, on the contrary, further aroused the anger and awareness of the proletarian revolutionary forces, enlightened the eyes of the deceived masses, and further mobilized the masses.

The more chaotic a place is, the more it actually disrupts the enemy, tempers the masses, and makes it possible to solve problems more thoroughly. The situation in the Wuhan area fully proves this. The evil plots of the enemy have been defeated. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed. The proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses have been educated and tempered in this serious class struggle, becoming more united and stronger. Establishing a new revolutionary order has become the conscious demand and action of the broad revolutionary masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area has entered a new stage. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Of course, turning bad things into good things requires certain conditions. We have the great Mao Zedong Thought, the wise leadership and lofty prestige of Chairman Mao. We have the broad masses who can be trusted and relied upon, we have the People's Liberation Army that can be trusted and relied upon, and we have the majority of cadres who can be trusted and relied upon. The People's Liberation Army is a well-organized and disciplined force of laboring people's children who have long revolutionary fighting traditions and are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the most reliable pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is precisely because we have these fundamental conditions that even if the enemy wants to create more chaos and for a longer time, it is nothing to be afraid of.

Now, the most important task facing the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses across the country is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, carry out thorough criticism, achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination, overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, carry out criticism, struggle, and reform in their own units, and this task is very heavy. Especially in the criticism, struggle, and reform in various units, it can be said that it has basically not started yet. To complete these tasks successfully and achieve great unity, it is very important.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to split into two irreconcilable factions within the working class." "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve great unity in the revolution. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve great unity on the basis of revolutionary principles." After a period of intense struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Wuhan area, the major issues have been clarified, the bad elements have been isolated, and the conservative organizations have disintegrated. Thus, the proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary mass organizations have the conditions to achieve great unity. This time, you have united to celebrate National Day and have united to welcome and receive the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu, which is a good beginning for achieving great unity. I hope you will continue to strive, overcome various obstacles on the road ahead, and achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination more quickly and better on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, with "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle.

To promote great unity, various revolutionary mass organizations should seriously study the works of Chairman Mao and his latest directives, carry out open rectification, make more self-criticism, see more of others' strengths, learn from each other, make up for each other's shortcomings, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. If anyone in a revolutionary mass organization sabotages great unity on the basis of revolutionary principles, it should be exposed and dealt with by the revolutionary masses of that organization, and other organizations should not go and struggle against them. The military and leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan area should do more ideological and political work to help and promote the great unity of various mass organizations.

The proletarian revolutionary forces unite to form a mighty revolutionary army, which can more extensively and deeply criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, carry out criticism, struggle, and reform in their own units, achieve the three-in-one combination, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the development of our socialist construction. It can already be seen that this year will be another bumper harvest year for agriculture. In less than a year, we have conducted three nuclear tests, including one missile-carrying nuclear weapon test and one hydrogen bomb test. In such a great revolution that overturns everything, some places and departments have paid a certain price in production, which was expected. Especially in places where there is chaos, production will inevitably be affected to some extent. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. Once chaos is turned into order, production will quickly recover and rise. The revolutionization of people's thoughts will inevitably be transformed into tremendous material force. We believe that after this cultural revolution, our socialist construction will surely usher in a new high tide of rapid development.

To carry the revolution through to the end and vigorously promote production to create new achievements in fulfilling the state plan quickly, economically, and efficiently is the great ambition and glorious task of the proletarian revolutionary forces. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely implement the strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production." Every revolutionary mass organization must be tested in production. We believe that the broad revolutionary workers and commune members in the Wuhan area will do this and will definitely be able to do it.

This cultural revolution is a comprehensive examination and severe test for cadres at all levels. After more than a year of the movement, a handful of bad elements have been exposed, a large number of good cadres have been discovered, and the shortcomings and mistakes in our cadre ranks have been exposed. Some of our cadres have become arrogant, thinking they are great, liking to put on airs, and enjoying scolding people, thus seriously alienating themselves from the masses, which is very dangerous. This situation is the result of the evil influence of the capitalist reactionary line promoted by Liu Shaoqi. Now, we should especially strengthen the education of cadres, better implement Chairman Mao's mass line, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses.

The vast majority of our cadres are good or relatively good. Even if they have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, most of them can be educated to correct their mistakes. As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialism and insist on not changing or changing repeatedly, we should allow them to make amends for their mistakes, achieve merit while atoning for guilt, and should help and educate them to recognize and correct their mistakes according to the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," so that they can return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We believe that through the criticism and help of the masses, a large number of cadres can be liberated.

Cadres at all levels should consciously accept the examination and criticism of the masses. We should adopt a welcoming attitude towards the exposure and criticism of the masses, rather than a resistant or even confrontational attitude. We should learn from Chairman Mao, as Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, has repeatedly taught us, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We should learn from the masses, go to the masses, and be willing to be the students of the masses. Only in this way can we gain the understanding and trust of the masses and achieve new merits for the people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in the face of the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has issued the great battle call of "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism." This is the basic guideline for guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview. "Selfishness" is the core of the bourgeois worldview and the ideological root of the survival and development of revisionism. Only by thoroughly eliminating "selfishness" from the mind can we uproot revisionism, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and better carry the anti-revisionist struggle to the end. The broad masses of workers and peasants, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and all proletarian revolutionary forces must, while transforming the objective world, strive to transform their subjective world. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against "selfishness" in our minds and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and turn the whole country into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrades and Revolutionary Comrades:

The friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania is personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and has withstood the severe tests of storms and tempests. This is a revolutionary and fighting friendship, the greatest and most precious friendship in the world.

Our two parties and peoples have always supported each other and advanced side by side in the common cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction and in the common struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

The Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people have always firmly supported the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression, to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and firmly opposed the conspiracy of American imperialism and its followers to create "two Chinas" in and outside the United Nations.

When the Khrushchev revisionist clique launched a sudden attack on the Communist Party of China, the Albanian Labor Party stood firm in its correct position, bravely stood up, and fiercely struck back at the Khrushchev revisionist clique's conspiracy to oppose Marxism-Leninism and China.

Now, the Albanian comrades are once again firmly supporting and enthusiastically praising our great cultural revolution. Comrade Enver Hoxha recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only of great significance to China but also to all revolutionary forces and the international communist and workers' movement around the world." This is a high evaluation of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great encouragement to the proletarian revolutionary forces and the people of our country.

The Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people have always given us the most resolute and enthusiastic proletarian internationalist support. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I once again express my sincere thanks and high respect.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite more closely with the heroic Albanian brothers, unite with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, and carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end, carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership to the end, and carry the struggle against reactionaries in various countries to the end!

Finally, let us shout:

Long live the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the heroic Albanian people!

Long live the strong Albanian People's Republic!

Long live the glorious Albanian Labor Party!

Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people!

Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!
