Comrade Zhou Enlai's Important Speech at the Mass Rally in Wuhan Welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation

Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech at the mass rally in Wuhan welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation on October 9 is as follows:

Dear Comrade Muḧamed Shehu, Dear Comrade Ramiz Alia, Dear Comrades of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, Comrades, Revolutionary Comrades, and Friends:

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation, led by Comrade Shehu, has come to our country with deep revolutionary sentiments from the heroic Albanian people to conduct a friendly visit. Over the past few days, the delegation has visited Jinan, Qingdao, Dazhai, Taiyuan, Yan'an, and now they have gathered in Wuhan. We once again extend our most sincere and warmest welcome to them.

Comrades and Revolutionary Comrades:

I want to share with you a piece of great news. Comrades Shehu, Alia, and the entire Albanian Party and Government Delegation have come to Wuhan at the special invitation of our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has invited them to personally see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. Comrades Shehu and Alia also wanted to come and see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution here. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, and support for the proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses in Wuhan.

Wuhan is a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. Our great leader Chairman Mao has many times sailed the Yangtze River here, breaking waves and surging forward. The proletarian revolutionary forces in Wuhan have always followed Chairman Mao in advancing through storms and waves. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have undergone new tests. Today, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Wuhan are holding a grand rally to welcome comrades from Albania, who are on the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. We feel particularly close and extremely excited.

The glorious Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has always held high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and resolutely opposed imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

After the end of World War II, a new revisionism emerged in Europe. First, the Tito renegade clique appeared in Yugoslavia. Then, in the Soviet Union, which has a glorious tradition of the Great October Revolution, the Khrushchev revisionist clique emerged. Many leaders of communist parties in various countries also degenerated into modern revisionists. The Albanian Labor Party was the first in Europe to raise the banner against revisionism. It fearlessly opposed strong forces, dared to face difficulties and isolation, remained unyielding, and waged an uncompromising struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership and the Tito renegade clique.

When the Soviet Union and other socialist countries were changing or were about to change their colors, the Albanian Labor Party insisted on the dictatorship of the proletariat and continued to follow the socialist path. To prevent the growth of revisionism and to counter the encirclement by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, the Albanian Labor Party recently took a series of major revolutionary measures: opposing bureaucratism, promoting atheism, liberating women, advocating spiritual incentives, narrowing the gap between high and low wages, reducing private plots and livestock, achieving full cooperation in agriculture, developing mountainous areas to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, having cadres participate in manual labor, implementing a cadre rotation system, nationalizing the militia, and bringing guns and hoes onto the stage of literature and art, etc. The Albanian comrades have been implementing these measures in the revolutionary movement with great determination and swift action, and there are many aspects worth learning from.

The Albanian Labor Party is one of the youngest communist parties in Europe. However, it adheres to the truth, is full of vitality, and makes continuous progress. It has made great contributions to the defense and development of Marxism-Leninism and to the world revolutionary cause. The fifth congress of the Albanian Labor Party held at the end of last year pushed the socialist revolution and socialist construction in Albania to a new high, established new merits for the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, and made the red flag of revolution in Albania even more brilliant. The dialectics of history is like this: as long as one grasps the truth, one can surpass others.

Chairman Mao, in his telegram to the fifth congress of the Albanian Labor Party, highly praised: "Heroic Albania, a great socialist beacon in Europe. The Soviet revisionist leadership, the Tito clique, and all kinds of renegades and scabs, compared to you, are nothing but a handful of yellow earth, while you are a mountain towering into the clouds." The Chinese people are deeply proud to have such a great ally as Albania.

The glorious Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, adheres to the revolutionary line of seizing power by force of arms and, in the class struggle at home and abroad, relies on the broad masses to continuously develop and strengthen the people's armed forces to defend the fruits of the revolution.

From the moment of its birth, the Albanian Labor Party has led the Albanian people to wage armed struggles, opposing the Italian-German fascist occupiers and traitors. When some "parliamentary fools" in Europe were preparing to surrender to the enemy to seek a position in the post-war bourgeois government, the Albanian Labor Party led the Albanian people to firmly grasp the gun, rely on their own strength to liberate the motherland, and support the anti-fascist struggles of the Greek and Yugoslav peoples. Since liberation, the Albanian Labor Party has led the Albanian people to hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, continuously strengthening national defense and vigilantly guarding the socialist motherland. The historical experience of the Albanian Labor Party once again proves the great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries are trying every means to subvert and occupy Albania. Recently, the Greek royalist fascists have come to power and are eyeing Albania, attempting to invade. Comrade Hoxha, at the fourth congress of the Democratic Front held in September, issued a stern warning to American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Greek royalist fascists, pointing out that if they dare to venture into Albania, they will suffer severe punishment. We fully support the solemn position expressed by Comrade Hoxha on behalf of the Albanian people. We believe that the heroic Albanian people, with their rich tradition of armed struggle, maintain high revolutionary vigilance and are full of fighting spirit, are invincible.

The Albanian people are not isolated. All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world stand with Albania. Although China and Albania are thousands of miles apart, our two parties and peoples are always fighting side by side. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries must count China and Albania together.

The glorious Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has always held high the banner of proletarian internationalism and implemented a revolutionary foreign policy.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of imperialism led by the United States, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, resolutely support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. The proletarian internationalist spirit of Albania has won universal praise from revolutionary people around the world, making Albania enjoy high international prestige.

American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the peoples of the world. Ending the aggression and oppression of American imperialism is a common task for the peoples of the world. The Vietnamese people are at the forefront of the armed struggle against American imperialism, tying down a significant portion of American imperialism's strength and dealing a heavy blow to its aggressive arrogance. To isolate and strike American imperialism to the greatest extent, we must establish the broadest possible international united front against American imperialism and its running dogs. This united front cannot include modern revisionism, which colludes with American imperialism and betrays the interests of the peoples of various countries, centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, but it must unite all anti-American forces that can be united. As long as we continue to consolidate and expand the anti-American united front and persist in the struggle, then, no matter how modern revisionism serves it, the day when the peoples of the world defeat American imperialism will surely come sooner.

Comrades and Revolutionary Comrades:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victories. Billions of people have truly been mobilized. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated as never before. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with Liu Shaoqi as their representative, have been exposed. The power they usurped has been returned to the hands of the proletariat. The revolutionary situation across the country is excellent.

The situation in the Wuhan area is also excellent, just like the rest of the country. More than two months ago, there were dark clouds and the enemy was rampant for a while. Now, the enemy has collapsed, and the proletarian revolutionary forces are surging forward, breaking waves and advancing. The development of the revolutionary situation in the Wuhan area vividly proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's judgment that "chaos has two aspects" and "bad things can be turned into good things."

Now it is clear: wherever there is chaos, it is either stirred up by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, or it is caused by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, or enemy spies who have not been reformed and are secretly causing trouble. At the same time, the existence and influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology in society also provide soil for the enemy to stir up trouble and carry out sabotage. We do not advocate chaos, but if the enemy insists on creating chaos, there is nothing to be afraid of. They are lifting stones to drop on their own feet. Through this chaos, the enemy has completely exposed their true faces. This has, on the contrary, further aroused the anger and awareness of the proletarian revolutionary forces, enlightened the eyes of the deceived masses, and further mobilized the masses.

The more chaotic a place is, the more it actually disrupts the enemy, tempers the masses, and makes it possible to solve problems more thoroughly. The situation in the Wuhan area fully proves this. The evil plots of the enemy have been defeated. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed. The proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses have been educated and tempered in this serious class struggle, becoming more united and stronger. Establishing a new revolutionary order has become the conscious demand and action of the broad revolutionary masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area has entered a new stage. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Of course, turning bad things into good things requires certain conditions. We have the great Mao Zedong Thought, the wise leadership and lofty prestige of Chairman Mao. We have the broad masses who can be trusted and relied upon, we have the People's Liberation Army that can be trusted and relied upon, and we have the majority of cadres who can be trusted and relied upon. The People's Liberation Army is a well-organized and disciplined force of laboring people's children who have long revolutionary fighting traditions and are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the most reliable pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is precisely because we have these fundamental conditions that even if the enemy wants to create more chaos and for a longer time, it is nothing to be afraid of.

Now, the most important task facing the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses across the country is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, carry out thorough criticism, achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination, overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, carry out criticism, struggle, and reform in their own units, and this task is very heavy. Especially in the criticism, struggle, and reform in various units, it can be said that it has basically not started yet. To complete these tasks successfully and achieve great unity, it is very important.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to split into two irreconcilable factions within the working class." "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve great unity in the revolution. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve great unity on the basis of revolutionary principles." After a period of intense struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Wuhan area, the major issues have been clarified, the bad elements have been isolated, and the conservative organizations have disintegrated. Thus, the proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary mass organizations have the conditions to achieve great unity. This time, you have united to celebrate National Day and have united to welcome and receive the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu, which is a good beginning for achieving great unity. I hope you will continue to strive, overcome various obstacles on the road ahead, and achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination more quickly and better on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, with "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle.

To promote great unity, various revolutionary mass organizations should seriously study the works of Chairman Mao and his latest directives, carry out open rectification, make more self-criticism, see more of others' strengths, learn from each other, make up for each other's shortcomings, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. If anyone in a revolutionary mass organization sabotages great unity on the basis of revolutionary principles, it should be exposed and dealt with by the revolutionary masses of that organization, and other organizations should not go and struggle against them. The military and leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army in the Wuhan area should do more ideological and political work to help and promote the great unity of various mass organizations.

The proletarian revolutionary forces unite to form a mighty revolutionary army, which can more extensively and deeply criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, carry out criticism, struggle, and reform in their own units, achieve the three-in-one combination, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the development of our socialist construction. It can already be seen that this year will be another bumper harvest year for agriculture. In less than a year, we have conducted three nuclear tests, including one missile-carrying nuclear weapon test and one hydrogen bomb test. In such a great revolution that overturns everything, some places and departments have paid a certain price in production, which was expected. Especially in places where there is chaos, production will inevitably be affected to some extent. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. Once chaos is turned into order, production will quickly recover and rise. The revolutionization of people's thoughts will inevitably be transformed into tremendous material force. We believe that after this cultural revolution, our socialist construction will surely usher in a new high tide of rapid development.

To carry the revolution through to the end and vigorously promote production to create new achievements in fulfilling the state plan quickly, economically, and efficiently is the great ambition and glorious task of the proletarian revolutionary forces. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely implement the strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production." Every revolutionary mass organization must be tested in production. We believe that the broad revolutionary workers and commune members in the Wuhan area will do this and will definitely be able to do it.

This cultural revolution is a comprehensive examination and severe test for cadres at all levels. After more than a year of the movement, a handful of bad elements have been exposed, a large number of good cadres have been discovered, and the shortcomings and mistakes in our cadre ranks have been exposed. Some of our cadres have become arrogant, thinking they are great, liking to put on airs, and enjoying scolding people, thus seriously alienating themselves from the masses, which is very dangerous. This situation is the result of the evil influence of the capitalist reactionary line promoted by Liu Shaoqi. Now, we should especially strengthen the education of cadres, better implement Chairman Mao's mass line, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses.

The vast majority of our cadres are good or relatively good. Even if they have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, most of them can be educated to correct their mistakes. As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialism and insist on not changing or changing repeatedly, we should allow them to make amends for their mistakes, achieve merit while atoning for guilt, and should help and educate them to recognize and correct their mistakes according to the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," so that they can return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We believe that through the criticism and help of the masses, a large number of cadres can be liberated.

Cadres at all levels should consciously accept the examination and criticism of the masses. We should adopt a welcoming attitude towards the exposure and criticism of the masses, rather than a resistant or even confrontational attitude. We should learn from Chairman Mao, as Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, has repeatedly taught us, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We should learn from the masses, go to the masses, and be willing to be the students of the masses. Only in this way can we gain the understanding and trust of the masses and achieve new merits for the people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in the face of the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has issued the great battle call of "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism." This is the basic guideline for guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview. "Selfishness" is the core of the bourgeois worldview and the ideological root of the survival and development of revisionism. Only by thoroughly eliminating "selfishness" from the mind can we uproot revisionism, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and better carry the anti-revisionist struggle to the end. The broad masses of workers and peasants, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and all proletarian revolutionary forces must, while transforming the objective world, strive to transform their subjective world. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against "selfishness" in our minds and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and turn the whole country into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrades and Revolutionary Comrades:

The friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania is personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and has withstood the severe tests of storms and tempests. This is a revolutionary and fighting friendship, the greatest and most precious friendship in the world.

Our two parties and peoples have always supported each other and advanced side by side in the common cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction and in the common struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

The Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people have always firmly supported the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression, to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and firmly opposed the conspiracy of American imperialism and its followers to create "two Chinas" in and outside the United Nations.

When the Khrushchev revisionist clique launched a sudden attack on the Communist Party of China, the Albanian Labor Party stood firm in its correct position, bravely stood up, and fiercely struck back at the Khrushchev revisionist clique's conspiracy to oppose Marxism-Leninism and China.

Now, the Albanian comrades are once again firmly supporting and enthusiastically praising our great cultural revolution. Comrade Enver Hoxha recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only of great significance to China but also to all revolutionary forces and the international communist and workers' movement around the world." This is a high evaluation of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great encouragement to the proletarian revolutionary forces and the people of our country.

The Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people have always given us the most resolute and enthusiastic proletarian internationalist support. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I once again express my sincere thanks and high respect.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite more closely with the heroic Albanian brothers, unite with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, and carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end, carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership to the end, and carry the struggle against reactionaries in various countries to the end!

Finally, let us shout:

Long live the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the heroic Albanian people!

Long live the strong Albanian People's Republic!

Long live the glorious Albanian Labor Party!

Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people!

Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

    周恩来同志在武汉革命群众欢迎阿党政代表团大会上发表重要讲话
    文化大革命取得决定性胜利全国形势大好
    霍查同志对我国文化大革命的高度评价是对我国人民的极大鼓舞
    现在摆在全国革命群众面前最重要的任务，就是在毛泽东思想原则基础上，以“斗私，批修”为纲，更好更快地实现革命的大联合和三结合，搞好革命大批判和本单位斗批改，狠抓革命猛促生产。应该特别加强对干部的教育，改善干群关系，通过群众的批评和帮助，解放一大批干部。
    新华社武汉九日电　周恩来同志九日在武汉市革命群众欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的穆罕默德·谢胡同志，亲爱的拉米兹·阿利雅同志，亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的同志们，武汉市革命群众、人民解放军指战员和红卫兵的战友们，同志们：
    以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，满载英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民深厚的革命情谊，来到我国进行友好访问。这几天，代表团分路访问了济南、青岛和大寨、太原、延安，现在汇合到了武汉，我们向他们再一次表示最衷心、最热烈的欢迎。
    同志们，战友们！
    我要告诉大家一个最大的喜讯。谢胡同志、阿利雅同志和阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的全体同志，这次是应我们的伟大领袖毛主席的专门邀请来到武汉的。毛主席请他们亲自来看看武汉的无产阶级文化大革命运动。谢胡同志，阿利雅同志，他们也很想来看看这里的无产阶级文化大革命运动。这是对武汉的无产阶级革命派和革命群众最大的关怀、最大的鼓舞、最大的支持。
    武汉，是具有光荣革命传统的城市。我们伟大的领袖毛主席曾经多次在这里乘风破浪，畅游长江。武汉的无产阶级革命派，一直是跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进的。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，你们又经受了新的考验。今天，武汉的无产阶级革命派在这里举行盛大集会，欢迎来自反帝反修斗争前线的阿尔巴尼亚战友，我们感到分外亲切，无比兴奋。
    以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，一贯高举马克思列宁主义伟大红旗，坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，欧洲出现了新的修正主义。首先在南斯拉夫出现了铁托叛徒集团。接着，在具有伟大的十月革命光荣传统的苏联，又产生了赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团。许多国家的共产党领导也堕落成为现代修正主义分子。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在欧洲首先举起了反对修正主义的大旗，不畏强暴，不怕困难，不怕孤立，坚贞不屈，同以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和铁托叛徒集团进行了针锋相对的、毫不调和的斗争。
    当苏联和其他一些社会主义国家已经改变或正在改变颜色的时候，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚持无产阶级专政，坚持走社会主义道路。为了防止修正主义滋长，为了对付帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的四面包围，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党最近又采取了一系列重大的革命化措施：反对官僚主义；宣传无神论；解放妇女；提倡精神鼓励；缩减高工资和低工资的差距；减少自留地和自留牲畜；农业全面合作化；发展山区，争取粮食自给；干部参加体力劳动；实行干部轮换制度；全国民兵化；枪和镐走上文艺舞台，等等。阿尔巴尼亚同志们在革命化运动中说到做到，雷厉风行，在许多方面值得我们好好学习。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是欧洲最年轻的共产党之一。但是，它坚持真理，朝气勃勃，不断前进，为捍卫和发展马克思列宁主义，为世界革命事业作出了伟大的贡献。去年年底举行的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，把阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向了一个新的高潮，为世界各国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争事业建立了新的功勋，使阿尔巴尼亚这面欧洲的革命红旗更加光彩夺目。历史的辩证法就是这样：只要掌握了真理，就可以后来居上。
    毛泽东主席在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中高度赞扬说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。”中国人民以有阿尔巴尼亚这样伟大的战友，而深深地感到自豪。
    以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，坚持武装夺取政权的革命路线，在国内外阶级斗争中，依靠广大群众，不断发展和壮大人民武装力量，保卫革命胜利的果实。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党从它诞生的时刻起，就领导阿尔巴尼亚人民展开武装斗争，反对意大利—德国法西斯占领者和卖国贼。当欧洲一些大大小小的“议会迷”，为了在战后资产阶级政府中求得一官半职而准备向敌人交枪投降的时候，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导阿尔巴尼亚人民，毫不动摇地紧握枪杆子，依靠自己的力量解放了祖国，并且支援了希腊和南斯拉夫人民的反法西斯的斗争。解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导阿尔巴尼亚人民一手拿镐、一手拿枪，不断加强国防，警惕地保卫着社会主义祖国。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的历史经验再一次证明了毛主席所指出的伟大真理：“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派千方百计地企图颠覆和侵占阿尔巴尼亚。最近，希腊保皇法西斯分子上台，更是虎视眈眈，妄图侵犯阿尔巴尼亚。霍查同志在九月召开的民主阵线第四次代表大会上对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义集团和希腊保皇法西斯分子提出了严厉的警告，指出如果他们胆敢冒险闯进阿尔巴尼亚，他们将遭到严厉的惩罚。我们完全支持霍查同志代表阿尔巴尼亚人民所表示的这一严正立场。我们相信，富有武装斗争传统的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，保持着高度的革命警惕性，充满着旺盛的战斗精神，是不可战胜的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民决不是孤立的。全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民都站在阿尔巴尼亚一边，阿尔巴尼亚的朋友遍天下。中阿两国虽然远隔万里，但是，我们两党和两国人民是永远并肩战斗的，帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派必须把中阿两国计算在一起。
    以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，一贯高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，执行革命的对外政策。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动和全世界人民的革命斗争。阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级国际主义精神，赢得了全世界革命人民的普遍赞扬，使阿尔巴尼亚享有崇高的国际威望。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。结束美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的共同任务。越南人民站在反美武装斗争的最前线，牵制了美帝国主义很大一部分力量，沉重地打击了它的侵略气焰。为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，我们必须建立一个最广泛的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。这个统一战线，不能包括与美帝国主义狼狈为奸、出卖各国人民利益的以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，但是要团结一切可以团结的反美力量。只要我们不断巩固和扩大反美统一战线，坚持斗争，那末，不管现代修正主义怎样为它效劳，全世界人民打败美帝国主义的日子就一定会早日到来。
    同志们、战友们！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。亿万群众真正发动起来了。毛泽东思想得到了空前未有的大普及。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了。被他们篡夺了的权力重新回到了无产阶级的手里。全国革命形势一片大好。
    武汉地区也同全国一样，形势大好。两个多月以前，曾经乌云翻腾，阶级敌人猖狂一时。现在，敌人已经土崩瓦解，无产阶级革命派正在乘风破浪，胜利前进。武汉地区革命形势的发展，生动地证明了毛主席关于“乱子有二重性”、“坏事也可以转变成为好事”的论断的英明正确。
    现在看得很清楚：凡是出乱子的地方，有的是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑动的，有的是没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子或者敌特分子暗中捣鬼的。同时，社会上资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的存在和影响，也为阶级敌人挑起事端，进行破坏提供了土壤。我们并不赞成出乱子，但是，阶级敌人硬要制造乱子，那也没有什么可怕。他们这样做，正是搬起石头打自己的脚。经过这么一乱，阶级敌人彻底暴露了他们自己的真面目。这就从反面更加激起了无产阶级革命派的愤怒和觉悟，擦亮了受蒙蔽群众的眼睛，把广大群众进一步动员起来了。
    乱得厉害的地方，实际是更加乱了敌人，锻炼了群众，问题反而可以解决得更彻底。武汉地区的情况充分证明了这一点。阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋被击败了。暗藏在党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了。无产阶级革命派和革命群众在这一场严重的阶级斗争中，受到了教育和锻炼，更加坚强和壮大了。建立新的革命秩序，变成了广大革命群众的自觉要求和行动。武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    当然，坏事变成好事，要有一定的条件。我们有伟大的毛泽东思想，有毛主席的英明领导和崇高威望。我们有可以相信和依靠的广大群众，我们有可以相信和依靠的人民解放军，我们有可以相信和依靠的干部大多数。而解放军是具有长期革命战斗传统，并为毛泽东思想武装起来的有组织有纪律的劳动人民子弟兵，是无产阶级文化大革命的最可靠支柱。正是由于我们有了这些最根本的条件，即使阶级敌人想乱得厉害一些，时间长一些，也没有什么了不起。
    现在，摆在全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众面前最重要的任务，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，搞好革命的大批判，实现革命的大联合和三结合。把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批倒、批臭，搞好本单位的斗批改，这方面的任务是十分繁重的。特别是各单位的斗批改，可以说基本上还没有开始。而要胜利地完成这些任务，实现革命的大联合是很重要的关键。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”武汉地区经过前一段时期两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的严重斗争，大是大非分清了，坏人孤立了，保守组织瓦解了。这样，无产阶级革命派和革命群众组织就具备了实现革命大联合的条件。这次，你们联合起来欢度国庆，又联合起来欢迎和接待以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，是走向革命大联合的一个良好开端。希望你们继续努力，克服前进道路上的种种障碍，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，以“斗私，批修”为纲，更好、更快地实现革命的大联合和三结合。
    为了促进革命的大联合，各革命群众组织应该认真学习毛主席著作和最高指示，开门整风，多作自我批评，多看别人的优点，互相学习，取长补短，加强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性。各革命群众组织中如有人破坏在革命原则基础上的大联合，要靠那个组织的革命群众自己揭发处理，别的组织不要去揪斗。武汉地区的人民解放军驻军和领导机关，应该多做思想政治工作，帮助和促进各群众组织实现大联合。
    无产阶级革命派联合起来，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，就更能对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，开展更广泛、更深刻的革命大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，实现革命的三结合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    无产阶级文化大革命，推动了我国社会主义建设事业的发展。已经可以看到，今年农业又将是一个丰收年。在不到一年的时间里，我们又进行了三次核试验，包括一次导弹核武器试验和一次氢弹试验。在这样一场翻天覆地的大革命运动中，某些地方，某些部门，在生产上付出一定代价，这是早在预计之内的。特别是在有乱子的地方，生产当然会受到一定的影响。但是，这只是暂时现象。一旦乱化为治，生产很快就能恢复上升。人的思想的革命化，势必转化为巨大的物质力量。我们相信，经过这场文化大革命，我国的社会主义建设事业必将出现一个新的飞跃发展的高潮。
    狠抓革命，猛促生产，为多快好省完成国家计划创造新成绩，这是无产阶级革命派应有的雄心壮志和光荣任务。我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的战略方针。每一个革命群众组织都要在生产中经受考验。我们相信，武汉地区的广大革命职工和公社社员一定会这样做的，而且也一定能够做到的。
    这一次文化大革命，对于各级干部来说，是一场全面的审查和严峻的考验。经过一年多来的运动，揪出了一小撮坏人，发现了一大批好干部，也暴露了我们干部队伍的缺点和错误。我们有些干部官作大了，自以为了不起，好摆架子，喜欢训人，因而严重地脱离群众，这是很危险的。这种情况是中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线所造成的恶劣影响。现在，我们应该特别加强对干部的教育，更好地贯彻毛主席的群众路线，改善干部同群众的关系。
    我们的干部绝大多数是好的或者比较好的。即使犯有错误，甚至犯有严重错误，多数也是可以教育过来的。只要不是反党反社会主义而又坚持不改、屡教不改的，我们都要容许他们将功补过，带罪立功，都应该按照团结——批评和自我批评——团结的公式，帮助和教育他们认识错误，改正错误，使他们重新回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们相信，经过群众的批评和帮助，是应该而且也可以解放一大批干部的。
    各级干部要自觉地接受群众的审查和批评。对群众的揭发和批判，我们应该采取欢迎的态度，而不应该采取抵触的乃至对立的态度。我们应该上请教于毛主席，象毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席所谆谆教导我们的那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我们应该下请教于群众，到群众中去，甘当群众的小学生。只有这样，才能取得群众的谅解和信任，为人民立新功。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的形势下，向我们发出了“斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号令。这是指导无产阶级文化大革命的基本纲领。无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的，就是要大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观。“私”字是资产阶级世界观的核心，是修正主义生存和发展的思想根源。只有从头脑中彻底铲除“私”字，才能挖掉修正主义的根子，才能树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。广大工农群众、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部、革命知识分子和所有无产阶级革命派，都必须在改造客观世界的同时，努力改造自己的主观世界。我们一定要按照毛主席的最新指示，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争，把全国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    战友们，同志们！
    中阿两党、两国、两国人民之间的友谊，是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲自缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则基础上的，是经历过急风暴雨的严峻考验的。这种友谊是革命的、战斗的友谊，是世界上最伟大、最珍贵的友谊。
    我们两党和两国人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同事业中，在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的共同斗争中，一贯相互支持，并肩前进。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民，一贯坚决支持中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略、维护国家主权和领土完整的斗争，坚决反对美帝国主义及其追随者在联合国内外制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    当赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团向中国共产党发动突然袭击的时候，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党坚持正确立场，挺身而出，勇敢地痛击赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团反对马克思列宁主义、反对中国的阴谋。
    现在，阿尔巴尼亚的战友们又坚决地支持和热情地赞扬我国这场伟大的文化大革命运动。恩维尔·霍查同志最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界一切革命派以及国际共产主义和工人运动都具有十分重大的意义。”这是对我国无产阶级文化大革命的高度评价，这是对我国无产阶级革命派和全国人民的极大鼓舞。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民一贯给予我们最坚决、最热情的无产阶级国际主义的支援，我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民再一次表示真诚的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”我们一定按照毛主席的教导，更加紧密地同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟团结起来，同全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民团结起来，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把反对各国反动派的斗争进行到底！
    最后，让我们高呼：
    中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的革命友谊和战斗团结万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    坚强的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的最亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的最亲密战友毛主席万岁！
    全世界人民的革命大团结万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
