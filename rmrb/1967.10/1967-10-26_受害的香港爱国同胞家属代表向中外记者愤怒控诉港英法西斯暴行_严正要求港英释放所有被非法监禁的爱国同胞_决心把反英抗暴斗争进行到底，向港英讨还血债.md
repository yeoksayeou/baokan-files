Relatives of Hong Kong patriots who were brutally killed or imprisoned by the British colonial fascist authorities in the anti-British struggle held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists on October 23. They angrily denounced the British colonial authorities' fascist atrocities against their loved ones and demanded that the British colonial authorities immediately release all patriots who have been illegally imprisoned. They vowed to continue the struggle against British oppression to the end and to seek justice for the blood debt owed by the British.

The wife of Chen Zhokang, chairman of the Hong Kong Electric Workers' Union, who was illegally imprisoned by the British colonial authorities, spoke on behalf of the relatives of workers, students, journalists, clerks, and other patriots who have been persecuted. She revealed the brutal persecution of patriots by the British colonial authorities and pointed out that since May this year, the British colonial authorities have used the labor dispute at the New Pukong Artificial Flower Factory as an excuse to launch an unprecedented fascist political persecution and national oppression against Chinese compatriots. Over the past five months, according to incomplete statistics, more than 20 patriots have been killed or beaten to death by British military and police, and more than 4,000 people have been illegally beaten, arrested, kidnapped, and interrogated, with more than 2,000 still in British prisons suffering inhumane torture. These persecuted patriots include workers, farmers, fishermen, students, teachers, film actors, journalists, clerks, and other patriots, even elderly people over 70 and children around 10 years old. Some were shot on the streets, some were beaten in police stations, and some were secretly killed in the dungeons of "courts." Many compatriots were illegally kidnapped on the streets, in their homes, in unions, in associations, in schools, and in patriotic organizations by the British, falsely accused, and even sentenced without trial and thrown into prisons.

Yan Shaoying angrily denounced the British colonial authorities for continuing to brutally persecute patriots after throwing them into prisons. She said that large numbers of patriots have been separately imprisoned in the Mount Davis Concentration Camp, Victoria Prison, Stanley Prison, Chi Ma Wan Prison, Lai Chi Kok Women's Prison, Heung Fai Road, and Ma Tau Wai Men's and Women's Juvenile Prisons.

She pointed out that the Mount Davis Concentration Camp in Ma On Shan is a typical fascist concentration camp. Those imprisoned there are all secretly kidnapped or illegally arrested by British military police or secret agents, completely without any "court" trial procedures, and have lost their freedom. Those imprisoned have no "sentence" and can be kept in prison year after year. British secret agents often subject them to exhausting "interrogations" and torture to extract confessions. In all prisons, our compatriots are starved, and when they fall ill, they not only do not receive proper treatment but are also forced to do hard labor. In Victoria Prison, a small room five feet wide and seven feet long is crowded with three to five people, with a toilet bucket placed inside. Whether in summer or winter, they sleep on the ground. The so-called hospital in British prisons is also used to torture patriots. Some patriots who fall ill and ask for treatment receive a beating instead. Inside the prisons, there are also "water cells" within the cells. Patriots are often confined alone in the "water cells" all day, only able to eat a small amount of cold rice porridge mixed with sand and stones. There is also the so-called "lockdown," where everyone in the prison is confined, with only 15 minutes of "exercise" time per day. The British authorities even attempt to "deport" patriots, forcing them to fill out forms and sign, claiming it is "voluntary deportation."

Yan Shaoying proudly praised her relatives and patriots for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fighting the enemy with heroic spirit. She said: Hong Kong patriots, despite facing brutal enemies, have endured beatings and arrests, torture, and have fought tenaciously, truly embodying the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "In front of beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice." They have turned "courts" and prisons into places to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Martyrs Xu Tianbo, Li An, Luo Jinguo, Zhang Jiji, Zhou Songsheng, and He Chuntian chose to be beaten to death rather than surrender. Young female student Zhang Puxuan fearlessly faced torture and threats of being sent to a mental hospital, and in court, she sternly exposed the fascist ugly face of the British colonial authorities. They fully demonstrated that "our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the death with our enemies," and they are truly good children of the motherland and good students of Chairman Mao.

Yan Shaoying strongly condemned the British colonial authorities for collaborating with the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries in their anti-China conspiracies, for suppressing the influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hong Kong, and for limiting the spread of invincible Mao Zedong Thought in Hong Kong. She said that the British fascist authorities are particularly hostile to patriots who wear Chairman Mao's badges and carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao." In court, "judges" repeatedly sentenced patriots who shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" to additional punishments. In prisons, the British authorities openly deprived patriots of the right to study Chairman Mao's works, not allowing them to receive "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" sent by relatives outside the prison. Some were even beaten for singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." However, the British authorities' obstruction is in vain. Hong Kong patriots who love Chairman Mao and are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, in the absence of Chairman Mao's works, have memorized and taught each other the "Three Articles" and dozens of quotations from Chairman Mao. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works in prison, fighting the British in a tit-for-tat struggle and achieving victory after victory, especially the great victory of celebrating National Day. On October 1, regardless of whether in men's prisons, women's prisons, or juvenile prisons, patriots broke through numerous restrictions and celebrated the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in various ways, wishing our great leader Chairman Mao a long life. Patriots also foiled the enemy's plot to "deport" them and firmly defended the right of Chinese compatriots to live freely in Hong Kong, which is Chinese territory.

Yan Shaoying, on behalf of all the persecuted relatives, strongly protested against the British fascist authorities' persecution of patriots in prison and sternly pointed out: The British colonial authorities must immediately implement the demands of the Chinese government and Hong Kong patriots, immediately release all persecuted Hong Kong patriots. The British colonial authorities must immediately stop persecuting patriots in prison, not obstruct relatives in prison from studying Chairman Mao's works, immediately stop using "deportation" to threaten patriots in prison, not allow beatings and insults of relatives in prison, and must improve the living conditions of relatives in prison.

Relatives of Xu Tianbo, a copper worker at the "Public Works Department Kowloon Mechanical Section" who was killed by the British, and those still illegally imprisoned by the British authorities, including Xue Ping, a reporter from the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, Guan Weiyang, a Kowloon bus worker, Zhang Puxuan, a student at Hanhua Middle School, Hu Diezhou, the editor-in-chief of Hong Kong Night News, Wang Ning and Huang Ze, reporters from Ta Kung Pao, Xu Yuzhen, an employee of Boshen Bank, Xiao Zi, deputy manager of Sanlian Bookstore, and Ma Jinlong, manager of Shengxin Native Products Company in Sheung Shui, spoke at the press conference or submitted written statements. They unanimously strongly condemned the British colonial authorities for their bloody suppression of Hong Kong compatriots and sternly demanded that the British colonial authorities immediately release all imprisoned patriots who have been fighting against British oppression. They repeatedly shouted: Return my husband! Return my wife! Return my parents! Return my children! Return my brothers and sisters! They resolutely declared: We will definitely join the Hong Kong patriots to firmly continue the struggle against British oppression to the end and seek justice for the blood debt owed by the British.

Nearly 60 journalists from Chinese and foreign news agencies, newspapers, and radio stations attended the press conference.

    受害的香港爱国同胞家属代表向中外记者愤怒控诉港英法西斯暴行
    严正要求港英释放所有被非法监禁的爱国同胞
    决心把反英抗暴斗争进行到底，向港英讨还血债
    新华社香港二十五日电　在反英抗暴斗争中，被港英法西斯当局野蛮杀害和监禁的香港爱国同胞的家属代表，二十三日举行中外记者招待会，愤怒控诉港英当局残酷迫害他们亲人的法西斯暴行，严正要求港英当局必须迅速实现我国政府和香港爱国同胞所提出的各项要求，立即释放所有被非法监禁的爱国同胞。
    被港英当局非法囚禁的香港电灯工会主席陈照康的妻子严少英，代表遭受迫害的工人、学生、新闻工作者、职员和其他爱国同胞的家属，用大量事实揭露了港英当局对爱国同胞的残暴迫害。她指出：今年五月以来，港英当局借新蒲岗人造胶花厂的劳资纠纷，对中国同胞进行了一场空前未有的法西斯的政治迫害和民族压迫。五个多月来，根据不完全的统计，有二十多名爱国同胞被港英军警枪杀或活活打死，有四千多人被非法殴打、拘捕、绑架和审讯，其中两千多人至今仍在港英的黑狱中遭受非人的折磨。这些受迫害的爱国同胞，包括爱国的工人、农民、渔民、学生、教师、电影演员、新闻工作者、职员和其他爱国同胞，甚至连七十多岁的老人和十岁左右的小孩都不能幸免。他们之中，有的在街头被枪杀，有的在警署被殴打，有的在“法庭”的地牢里被私刑谋害；许多同胞在街头、家里、工会、社团、学校和爱国机构被港英非法绑架后，或被横加“罪名”，甚至不经讯问，就胡乱判刑，投入黑狱。
    严少英愤怒控诉港英当局把爱国同胞投入黑狱后，还对他们继续施以残酷的迫害。她说：大批爱国同胞被分别囚禁在域多利集中营，维多利亚监狱，赤柱监狱，芝麻湾监狱，荔枝角女监狱，海棠路、马头围男女儿童监狱。
    她指出，设在摩星岭的域多利集中营，是典型的法西斯集中营。被囚禁在那里的爱国同胞，都是被港英军警或特务秘密绑架和非法逮捕，完全不经“法庭”审讯程序就失去了自由的。被囚禁的人没有“刑期”，可以年复一年的关下去。港英特务经常对他们进行疲劳“审讯”，严刑迫供。在所有的监狱里，我们的同胞都是吃不饱饭，生病不但得不到应有的治疗，还要受到强迫劳役的虐待。在维多利亚监狱，一间五英尺宽七英尺长的小房间，挤着三个到五个人，还要摆上便桶。不论夏天或冬天，都是睡在地上。港英监狱里的所谓病房，也被用来虐待爱国同胞。有些爱国同胞生了病，要求医治，得到的却是一顿毒打。监狱里面，还设有狱中之狱的“水饭房”。爱国同胞时常被整天单独禁闭在“水饭房”中，只能吃到少量的夹有沙石的冷水泡饭。还有所谓“封仓”，把整个监狱的人都禁闭起来，每天只有十五分钟“放风”时间。港英当局甚至还妄图将爱国同胞“递解出境”，强迫填表签名，当做“自愿递解”。
    严少英以无比自豪的心情赞扬她们的亲人和爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同敌人斗争的英雄气概。她说：港九爱国同胞在凶恶的敌人面前，尽管遭到毒打和逮捕，受到酷刑，但他们英勇不屈，同敌人进行了顽强的斗争，真正做到了伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”他们把“法庭”和监狱，变成了宣传毛泽东思想的场所。徐田波、李安、罗进苟、章集、邹松胜、何传添等烈士，宁肯被活活打死，也决不屈服。青年女学生张普璇不畏严刑，不怕把她送精神病院的威胁，在“法庭”上义正辞严地揭露了港英当局的法西斯丑恶面目。他们充分表现了“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”，他们不愧为祖国的好儿女，毛主席的好学生。
    严少英强烈谴责港英当局为了配合美帝、苏修和各国反动派反华的阴谋，为了阻遏我国无产阶级文化大革命对香港的影响，为了限制战无不胜的毛泽东思想在香港的传播，对我爱国同胞进行的一系列的血腥镇压。她说，港英法西斯当局对佩戴毛主席像章和携带《毛主席语录》的爱国同胞最为敌视，虐待更甚。在“法庭”上，“法官”竟对高呼“毛主席万岁”的爱国同胞一再加“刑”。在监狱中，港英当局更是公然剥夺爱国同胞学习毛主席著作的权利，不许他们接受狱外亲人送去的《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”。还有人曾经因为唱《大海航行靠舵手》而被毒打。但是，港英当局的阻挠完全是徒劳的。无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的香港爱国同胞，在手头没有毛主席著作的情况下，许多人依靠记忆背诵，互教互学，背出了“老三篇”和几十条毛主席语录。他们在狱中活学活用毛主席著作，和港英进行了针锋相对的斗争，取得了一次又一次的胜利，特别是庆祝国庆的重大胜利。十月一日那一天，无论男监、女监或儿童监狱，爱国同胞冲破重重禁制，用各种各样的方式，庆祝了中华人民共和国成立十八周年的伟大节日，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。爱国同胞们还粉碎了敌人的“递解出境”的阴谋，坚决保卫了中国同胞在中国领土香港自由居住的权利。
    严少英代表所有受迫害的家属对港英法西斯当局迫害狱中的爱国同胞，提出了最强烈的抗议，并严正指出：港英当局必须迅速实现我国政府和香港爱国同胞所提出的各项要求，立即释放所有遭受迫害的香港爱国同胞。港英当局必须立即停止迫害狱中的爱国同胞，不得阻难狱中亲人学习毛主席著作，立即停止用“递解出境”的手段来威胁狱中的爱国同胞，不许殴打和侮辱狱中的亲人，必须改善狱中亲人的生活条件。
    被港英法西斯当局杀害了的港英“工务局九龙机械部”打铜工人徐田波、迄今仍被港英当局非法囚禁的新华社香港分社记者薛平、九龙巴士工人关伟扬、汉华中学学生张普璇、香港夜报社长胡棣周、大公报记者王宁和黄泽、宝生银行职员徐玉贞、三联书店副经理萧滋、上水忠信土产公司马金龙等人的家属，分别在记者招待会上发表了讲话或书面讲话。他们一致强烈谴责港英当局对香港同胞进行血腥镇压，严正要求港英当局立即释放所有被囚禁的反英抗暴的爱国同胞。他们不断高呼：还我丈夫！还我妻子！还我父母！还我儿女！还我兄弟姊妹！他们坚决表示：我们一定要与香港爱国同胞一道，坚决把反英抗暴斗争进行到底，向港英讨还血债。
    参加记者招待会的有中外通讯社、报社和电台记者近六十人。
