The red sun rises in the east, with rays of light shining brightly,
Mountains rejoice and seas sing as the red flag waves high,
Billions of people smile and turn their hearts towards Beijing,
Unanimously wishing Chairman Mao a long life without end!

Celebrating National Day, we see a year of great achievements,
Our hearts surge and blood boils as we sing loudly:
Sing of Chairman Mao's wise leadership,
Sing of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts;
Sing of the great achievements of New China,
Sing of the revolutionary heroes and pioneers.

Recall that day, August 18th of last year,
Eternally engraved in our hearts, never to be forgotten.
On that day, red flags rolled across Beijing,
Red heroes and quotations formed an ocean.
The melody of "The East Is Red" echoed across the five continents,
A red sun rose above Tiananmen Gate.

Chairman Mao waved his mighty hand, directing the battle,
The revolutionary army raised the red flag and charged onto the battlefield!

Chairman Mao initiated the Cultural Revolution,
Shocking the nation and the world with its swift and extraordinary force.

(Spoken) Chairman Mao said: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

Chairman Mao issued the call, and the nation responded,
Workers, peasants, and soldiers, along with Red Guards, kept it in their hearts.
Carrying the four volumes of Chairman Mao's works,
Holding high the sixteen-point battle line,
Waving red flags and brandishing pens, they threw themselves into the battle,
Daring to fight and daring to win, they were invincible.

Crossing mountains and rivers, fearing no hardships,
They spread the sparks of revolution, traveling far and wide.
Volume after volume of quotations illuminated the sky,
Song after song of revolution warmed people's hearts;
Poster after poster like cannon fire,
Slogan after slogan pierced the enemy's chest!

Shanghai launched the "January Storm,"
The revolutionary faction seized power, joyfully celebrating.
The people's army, created by Chairman Mao,
Had the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes, unparalleled in the world.
Chairman Mao issued the call for "Three Supports and Two Militaries,"
The children of the army responded enthusiastically, with high morale.
The army loved the people, and the people supported the army, united against the enemy,
Attacking, they conquered; fighting, they won, forming an iron wall.
Loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line,
Swearing to defend Chairman Mao's great thoughts!

Revolutionaries took on heavy responsibilities, promoting production,
The revolutionary faction held the seal, with red hearts and strong wills.
In the southwest of the motherland, thunder rolled,
The Taihang Mountains spread good news, with red flags flying;
Hearing Qingdao's victory song, the Yellow Sea rejoiced,
Seeing the dawn break over Heilongjiang in the northeast;
Beijing's sun shone red, with golden rays shining,
The northwestern plateau added new chapters.
The "Three-in-One" revolutionary committees were as solid as rocks,
The revolutionary faction united in a grand march.
Following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment,
They firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle.
Drums beat and horns blew, launching a general assault,
Holding high the "thousand-catty club," they rushed to the battlefield.
Criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev,
Swearing to bury revisionism, capitalism, and feudalism completely!
Eliminating hidden dangers, uprooting evil, and cleansing toxins,
Scaring the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries into a panic.
Chairman Mao pointed the way, invincible,
The revolutionary faction pursued the fleeing enemy, growing stronger with each battle.
Chairman Mao inspected various places with vigorous steps,
The revolutionary faction, inspired, broke waves and surged forward.
Seeing today's red and brilliant mountains,
The revolutionary fire burns the earth, growing more intense.
Dressed in red, adding new colors, the mountains are charming,
The red sun shines over the globe, with rays of light shining brightly!
Drums and gongs resound, good news comes frequently,
In the midst of victory songs, celebrating National Day, joyfully ecstatic.
Thousands dance, millions dance, everyone dances,
Thousands of songs, millions of songs, each song praises the Party;
Thousands of hearts, millions of hearts, each heart is red,
Thousands of flowers, millions of flowers, each flower faces the sun.
Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!
Chairman Mao, long live without end!
