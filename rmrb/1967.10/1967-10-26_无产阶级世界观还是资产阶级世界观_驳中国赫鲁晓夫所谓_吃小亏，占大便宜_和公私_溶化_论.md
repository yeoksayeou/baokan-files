The current great proletarian cultural revolution in our great motherland, fundamentally speaking, is a revolution to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview. It is a revolution to eliminate the private ownership concept that has persisted for thousands of years and to establish the communist public ownership concept.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," pointed out: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not yet been truly resolved."

The top capitalist-roaders within the Party have long been spreading the ideas of "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits" and the so-called "public-private fusion," which is a prominent manifestation of their attempt to transform the world according to the bourgeois worldview.

The set of life philosophies propagated by China's Khrushchev is a "private" doctrine compiled from the hypocritical rhetoric of bourgeois politicians and the moral tenets of petty bourgeoisie. By analyzing his bourgeois worldview centered on personal interests, we can more deeply expose his reactionary nature from the class roots and ideological roots.

The Bourgeois Philistine Philosophy

"Suffering small losses, gaining big benefits" is a "principle" that China's Khrushchev has derived from his decades of political opportunism and "cultivation" of life. This "proverb" nakedly exposes the bourgeois philistine's nature of seeking profit at all costs and reveals the ugly soul of this contemporary greatest egoist.

It is impossible to fully cite China's Khrushchev's verbose "theories" of bourgeois egoism, as every word and action of his is permeated with this philistine spirit. However, in a heart-to-heart conversation with a big capitalist, there is a particularly "brilliant" discussion that concentrates the essence of "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits." We might as well quote it here:

"Suffering small losses, gaining big benefits, is the law of development in the opposite direction. Thinking about oneself all day will ultimately result in the loss of personal interests, and personal interests will be further lost. Doing things for the people, everyone will take care of you... Thinking about oneself all day will not result in personal interests. Not thinking about oneself will ultimately result in personal interests, suffering small losses, gaining big benefits, this is in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview."

Chairman Mao said: "In terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two sides: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Either it is the proletarian worldview or the bourgeois worldview." To which "side" does China's Khrushchev's "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits" belong? Is it really, as he claims, "in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview"?

This is a question that must be clarified.

What is the proletarian worldview? "Serving the people wholeheartedly," "putting the interests of the people first, not the interests of individuals or small groups," "having no selfishness," "seeking no personal gain but dedicating oneself to the people." This is the proletarian worldview.

What is the bourgeois worldview? Having only personal interests in mind, seeking fame, wealth, power, position, and attention, forgetting the collective, forgetting the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers. Everything is based on the "private" self. This is the bourgeois worldview.

When China's Khrushchev propagates his "theory" of "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits," he also hypocritically talks about "serving the people wholeheartedly" and "putting personal matters aside," etc. On the surface, this seems a bit more sophisticated than naked bourgeois individualism. However, if we place it under the microscope of Mao Zedong Thought, it is not difficult to see that behind these beautiful phrases, there is a stench of bourgeois individualism, hidden behind a rotten "private" self.

China's Khrushchev also tells people not to fear "temporary misunderstandings and suspicions," not to fear "hardship," and to "work hard and endure," right? However, the so-called "hardship" and "enduring hardship" are merely means to seek fame and profit, merely capital for personal "promotion and enrichment." He himself has made it very clear: "Under socialist conditions, those who focus solely on personal interests will not achieve personal interests," "do not be afraid of suffering small losses, and you will gain big benefits in the future." "When interacting with others, be willing to suffer small losses... Work hard and endure, and in the end, people will say you are a good person, everyone will want to be friends with you, and there will be great development in the future." He also inadvertently reveals: "I graduated from high school, did not go to college,... did I not suffer a loss? Not necessarily. I think many people are not as good as me.... Joining the revolution is the first generation, now I am a member of the Central Committee." This self-satisfied confession is not a complete exposure of the nature of this political swindler?

Starting from the "private" (personal interests), using the "public" (the interests of the Party and the people) as a cover, treating the cause of the Party and the people as a tool and ladder for personal advancement, ultimately achieving the goal of the "private" self. China's Khrushchev's "theory" of "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits" is a cycle of bourgeois egoism with the "private" self as the center and "gaining big benefits" as the radius.

The philistine philosophy of "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits" concentrates the hypocrisy and opportunism of the bourgeoisie, concentrates the corrupt moral appearance of capitalist society and the relationship of mutual deception among people. Everyone knows that in general, the bourgeoisie often puts on a dignified and magnanimous appearance, using small favors to deceive the masses and buy their hearts, in order to achieve exploitation and profiteering through deception and oppression. "Suffering losses," "gaining benefits," etc., are originally the jargon of the bourgeois exchange, only to be spoken from the mouths of speculators.

In the eyes of the proletariat, struggling and sacrificing for the cause of the people is the greatest happiness, and it is not "suffering losses"; similarly, bearing a certain amount of leadership responsibility for the cause of the people is a duty that revolutionaries must fulfill, and it is not "gaining big benefits" or having great development. We communists, no matter when and where, should not weigh what "losses" and "benefits" we get, right? When the combat hero Huang Jiguang used his chest to block the enemy's gun port, did he consider what big benefits he would gain? When the communist warrior Lei Feng used his words and deeds to add bricks and tiles to the socialist edifice, did he consider what losses he suffered?

The characteristic of China's Khrushchev's philistine philosophy of egoism is to harm others for personal gain, to harm the public for private gain, which is completely incompatible with the communist spirit of the proletariat. However, he shamelessly wants to label this outdated bourgeois commodity with the label of "Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview." Can fish eyes be mixed with pearls! If Marx and Lenin were still alive, they would certainly send the words of this opportunist who pretends to be a Marxist-Leninist to this opportunist: "I sowed dragon seeds, but reaped fleas."

The Egoist's View of "Public" and "Private"

Whether to serve the public or the private, this is the psychology, thought, and worldview of the two classes of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Serving the public is the core of the proletarian worldview, and serving the private is the core of the bourgeois worldview.

The proletariat takes the abolition of private ownership and the liberation of all mankind as its mission, and regards serving the public wholeheartedly as the highest moral standard; while the bourgeoisie depicts the private ownership society of man-eating man as a paradise of "liberty, equality, fraternity," and regards "if one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth" as an eternal "truth."

In order to propagate the bourgeois worldview and to find a "theoretical" basis for the legitimate existence of the old ideology of maintaining and restoring private ownership, China's Khrushchev ingeniously invented the so-called "public-private fusion" theory. He said: "Personal interests must and can be completely consistent with the interests and development of the Party," "personal interests and purposes should be completely fused into the general interests and purposes of the Party and the class."

This cunning philistine is very good at playing the role of a compromiser. It seems that as long as he prays like a priest, the two fundamentally opposed thoughts of "public" and "private" will be completely harmonious and consistent, without contradictions, and the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview can be "unified."

Is that so? No, absolutely not!

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The collective's affairs and personal affairs, public affairs and private affairs, the two sides engage in a tug-of-war, one gains while the other loses, the other gains while the one loses.... This is the law of things."

China's Khrushchev's so-called "public-private fusion" theory is completely a lie, and his true purpose is to use egoism to "fuse" the fundamental interests of our Party and class, to use the "private" self to "fuse" the "public" self. Let us see how he uses egoism to "fuse" the fundamental interests of our Party and class under the banner of "public-private fusion"!

"We joined the Party because we saw that personal problems could not be solved, so we first solved the national interests. When the national social problems are solved, personal problems are also solved." It is with this despicable personal purpose that he opportunistically infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and used the important positions he usurped in the Party and the state to peddle bourgeois goods everywhere, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism in China. Is this not using the "private" self to "fuse" the "public" self under the banner of "public-private fusion"?

"For the sake of the Party and the revolution, cherish oneself, protect one's life and health..." In order to save a few lives, he instructed his henchmen to surrender and betray, and was not afraid to sell out the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. Is this not using the "private" self to "fuse" the "public" self under the banner of "public-private fusion"?

China's Khrushchev's "public-private fusion" theory is of the same kind as the philistine philosophy of "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits." This point, he himself explained very clearly in a conversation in February 1960. He said: "Personal interests must be taken care of, without personal interests there is no overall interest, personal interests concentrated together are collective interests.... Therefore, it is not selflessness, but public and private coexistence, public first and private second."

Every word is tied to the "private" self, and every sentence emphasizes "personal interests." This is his view of "public" and "private," this is the essence of his bourgeois worldview!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members, at all times and in all places, should not put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people. Therefore, selfishness, laziness, corruption, and careerism are the most despicable; while selflessness, active effort, self-discipline, and hard work are respectable."

Marxism does not deny the existence of personal interests. However, we must, as Chairman Mao teaches, make personal interests subordinate to the interests of the class and the people. In order to consolidate and develop the socialist political and economic systems, we must advocate the concept of serving the public wholeheartedly, and require ourselves and inspire others with the spirit of selfless communism. We must not, like China's Khrushchev, spread the poison of bourgeois egoism everywhere.

"Without personal interests, there is no overall interest," "socialism and collectivism cannot be separated from personal interests." In the eyes of this bourgeois egoist, personal interests are everything, and everything is for the personal self. What collective interests, what socialism, are all intangible abstract concepts, while only the personal self and private property are real things. This is completely the voice of an extreme individualist of the bourgeoisie. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought tell us that the proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all mankind. Without the interests of the proletariat and all laboring people, without the collective interests of socialism, there can be no abstract, independent personal interests.

"Personal interests concentrated together are collective interests." This is a mathematical game played by China's Khrushchev like a magician. He equates individualism and collectivism, two fundamentally different things, through quantitative relationships, which actually erases collective interests with personal interests.

Collective interests are the common interests of the broad masses of laborers. They reflect the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers, and are not the mechanical sum of personal interests. Collective interests are always above personal interests. How can the relationship between the two be replaced by a simple quantitative relationship? Can the socialist collective interests be constituted by everyone pursuing personal interests?

China's Khrushchev's absurd logic makes one think of a famous saying by Jeremy Bentham, a British utilitarian of the 19th century. He said: "Personal interests are the only real interests," "social interests are only an abstraction, they are nothing but the sum of personal interests."

"Helplessly, the flowers fall, and the swallows return as if they had met before." China's Khrushchev's view of "public" and "private" is so similar to that of this 19th-century bourgeois politician!

Perpetually Raise the Banner of Struggling Against Selfishness and Criticizing Revisionism

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a call to arms to the people of the whole country: to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. This is a great historical task proposed by Chairman Mao based on the law of class struggle in the period of proletarian dictatorship and the characteristics of the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological sphere. It has dealt a devastating blow to China's Khrushchev and the bourgeois ideological system he represents.

As early as more than a hundred years ago, the founders of scientific communism, Marx and Engels, in their epoch-making great historical document "The Communist Manifesto," wisely asserted: "The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; it is therefore not surprising that it will also be the most radical rupture with traditional ideas."

The practice of class struggle tells us that after the abolition of the private ownership of the means of production, the private ownership concept that reflects the existence of private ownership is not quickly eliminated. This private ownership concept is like bacteria invading the human body; if it is not eliminated, it will poison our body. As Comrade Lin Biao said: "The existence and influence of the ideological system of the exploiting class will ultimately lead to the restoration of the old regime that maintains private ownership."

The historical lessons of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries eloquently prove: In order for the proletariat to achieve complete victory in the socialist revolution, it is not only necessary to use violence to smash the state machine of the bourgeoisie, and to thoroughly eliminate the capitalist private ownership of the means of production, but also to engage in long-term and arduous struggles against the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and to thoroughly break with the traditional concepts that maintain private ownership and the "private" self in the mind.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, are the most stubborn defenders and active propagandists of the reactionary ideological system of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. China's Khrushchev enthusiastically propagates the philistine philosophy of "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits" and the outdated "public-private fusion" theory, attempting to corrupt the masses with the reactionary thoughts of feudalism and capitalism, to conquer hearts and minds, and to prepare for the restoration of capitalism.

For this reason, in order to do a good job of struggling against selfishness, we must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons to thoroughly criticize his bourgeois egoism, and thoroughly criticize the "suffering small losses, gaining big benefits" and the so-called "public-private fusion" theory he propagates.

For this reason, in order to do a good job of criticizing revisionism, we must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons, concentrate our efforts to criticize and expose the chief of the revisionists—China's Khrushchev, and at the same time, carry out in-depth struggle, criticism, and transformation in various departments and units, thoroughly eliminating the poison of revisionism on all fronts.

Marx, in his "Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy," once said: "With the change in the economic base, the entire superstructure also changes, either slowly or quickly." No matter how deeply rooted the ideological system of the exploiting class is, it has already become like a sinking ship and a decaying tree, and it will inevitably perish according to the dialectics of history. While the communist worldview of the proletariat is like a ship with thousands of sails and a forest of spring greenery, forever full of invincible power.

Let China's Khrushchev's "private" doctrine and various filthy "theories" of bourgeois egoism all go to hell! We will forever raise the banner of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to open up a bright red communist new world!

    无产阶级世界观还是资产阶级世界观
    ——驳中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“吃小亏，占大便宜”和公私“溶化”论
    当前，在我们伟大祖国进行的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上说，就是大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观的革命，就是破除几千年来的私有观念，建立共产主义公有观念的大革命。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉著作中指出：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，长期以来大肆散布什么“吃小亏，占大便宜”和所谓公私“溶化”论，就是他要按照资产阶级世界观改造世界的一个突出的表现。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的这套人生哲学，是用资产阶级政客的虚伪词藻和市侩道德的信条拼凑而成的“私”字经。通过对他一心为私的资产阶级世界观的剖析，我们可以更加深入地从阶级根源和思想根源上揭露他的反动嘴脸。
    资产阶级的市侩哲学
    “吃小亏，占大便宜”，这是中国赫鲁晓夫从他几十年的政治投机生涯和“修养”生活中悟出来的一条“准则”。这句“名言”，赤裸裸地暴露了资产阶级市侩一本万利、唯利是图的本色，也恰到好处地描绘出了这个当代最大的利己主义者的丑恶灵魂。
    要全面地引证中国赫鲁晓夫所反复宣扬的资产阶级利己主义的烦琐的“理论”是不可能的，因为他的一言一行都浸透了这种十足的市侩精神。不过，在他和一个大资本家的推心置腹的谈话中有一段十分“精采”的议论，比较集中地表达了“吃小亏，占大便宜”的内容，我们不妨抄录如下：
    “吃点小亏，占大便宜，是向相反方向发展的规律。整天想到个人，最后是没有个人利益，个人利益还要丧失一部分。为人民做事，大家就会照顾……整天考虑个人即不会有个人。不考虑个人，则最后有个人利益，占小便宜，吃大亏，吃点小亏，占大便宜，这是合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的。”
    毛主席说：“就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。或者是无产阶级的世界观，或者是资产阶级的世界观。”中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的“吃小亏，占大便宜”，究竟是属于那一“家”呢？真是象他自己所标榜的那样“合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观”吗？
    这是一个不可不弄清楚的问题。
    什么是无产阶级世界观？“全心全意地为人民服务”，“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小团体的利益出发”，“毫无自私自利之心”，“毫不利己专门利人”。这就是无产阶级世界观。
    什么是资产阶级世界观？心目中只有个人利益，争名，争利，争权，争位，争出风头，忘记了集体，忘记了无产阶级和广大劳动群众的根本利益。一切从“私”字出发。这就是资产阶级世界观。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在他宣扬那套“吃小亏，占大便宜”的“理论”时，也假惺惺地说什么要“全心全意为人民服务”，要“把个人的事情放浅薄一些”等等。表面看来，这好象要比那些赤裸裸的资产阶级个人主义要“高明”一点。但是，只要我们把它放到毛泽东思想的显微镜下，就不难看出，在这些漂亮的词句后面，隐藏着臭气熏天的资产阶级个人主义，隐藏着一个充满铜臭的“私”字。
      中国赫鲁晓夫不是也叫人们不要怕“暂时的误会怀疑”，不要怕“吃苦”，要“任劳任怨”吗？但是，所谓“吃苦”，“任劳任怨”云云，只不过是一种猎取名利的手段，只不过是个人“升官发财”的资本。他自己说得很清楚：“在社会主义条件下，一心一意搞个人利益的人，是搞不到个人利益的”，“不要怕吃小亏，以后才会占大便宜。”“与人接触时，情愿吃点亏……任劳任怨，最后人家说你是好人，大家愿意与你交朋友，将来还有大发展”。他还不打自招地说：“我是中学毕业，没进大学，……我不是吃了亏吗？不见得。我看许多人还不如我。……参加革命是第一代，现在当了中央委员。”这一段得意忘形的自白，不是把这个政治奸商的投机本性暴露无遗了吗？
    从“私”字（个人利益）出发，打着“公”字（党和人民的利益）的幌子，把党和人民的事业，看做是个人向上爬的工具和阶梯，最后达到“私”字的目的。中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“吃小亏，占大便宜”的“理论”，就是一个以“私”字为圆心，以“占大便宜”为半径的资产阶级利己主义的循环图。
      “吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学，集中反映了资产阶级的虚伪性和投机性，集中反映了资本主义社会腐败的道德面貌和人与人之间尔虞我诈的关系。大家知道，在一般情况下，资产阶级往往要装出一副道貌岸然、雍容大度的样子，用小恩小惠来迷惑群众，收买人心，以便通过欺骗压榨，牟取暴利。“吃亏”，“占便宜”等等，本来就是资产阶级交易所里的行话，只有从投机商的嘴里才吐得出来的。
    在无产阶级看来，为人民的事业而艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲，是最大的幸福，而决不是什么“吃亏”；同样，为人民的事业而担负一定的领导工作，是对革命应尽的职责，也决不是什么“占大便宜”，有大发展。我们共产党人，无论何时何地都不应该拈斤估两，去考虑什么“吃亏”、“占便宜”的问题，难道战斗英雄黄继光在用自己的胸膛挡住敌人枪眼的时候，他会考虑自己占什么大便宜吗？难道共产主义战士雷锋在用他的一言一行为社会主义大厦增砖添瓦的时候，他会考虑自己吃了什么亏吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的利己主义市侩哲学的特性，就是损人利己，损公肥私，它同无产阶级的共产主义精神是格格不入的。然而，他却厚颜无耻，硬要给这种陈腐不堪的资产阶级货色贴上“马列主义无产阶级世界观”的标签。鱼目岂能混珠！如果马克思和列宁还在世的话，他们一定会把海?对自己的模仿者的话转送给这个惯于冒充马列主义的机会主义者：“我播下的是龙种，而收获的却是跳蚤”。
      利己主义的“公”“私”观
    为公，还是为私，这是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的心理，两个阶级的思想，两个阶级的世界观。为公，是无产阶级世界观的核心，为私，是资产阶级世界观的核心。
    无产阶级把消灭私有制，解放全人类作为自己的天职，把一心为公当作思想道德的最高标准；而资产阶级却把人吃人的私有制社会描绘成“自由、平等、博爱”的乐园，把“人不为己、天诛地灭”当作永恒的“公理”。
      中国赫鲁晓夫为了宣扬资产阶级世界观，为了替维护私有制、恢复私有制的旧意识形态找到合法存在的“理论”根据，就别出心裁地编造了所谓公私“溶化”论。他说：“个人利益必须而且可能与党的利益和发展取得完全一致”，“个人的利益与目的更应该完全溶化在党与阶级的一般利益和目的中。”
    这个狡猾的市侩，很会玩弄折衷主义的手法。仿佛只要他象神甫一样祷告一下，“公”与“私”这两种根本对立的思想就完全协调一致，没有矛盾了，无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观就可以“合二而一”了。
    事情真是这样吗？不，绝对不是！
    林彪同志说：“集体的事和个人的事，公事和私事，两个方面互相展开争夺战，此长彼消，彼长此消。……这是事情的规律。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫高唱的所谓公私“溶化”论，完全是骗人的鬼话，而假公济私、以私溶公才是他的真正目的。他大吹大擂什么公与私“完全一致”、“完全溶化”，就是妄图取消破私立公的斗争，取消无产阶级世界观对资产阶级世界观的斗争。
    让我们来看他是怎样在公私“溶化”的幌子下，用利己主义来“溶化”我们党和阶级的根本利益，用“私”字来“溶化”“公”字的吧！
      “我们加入党，是看到个人的问题横竖解决不了，先解决国家利益。国家社会问题解决了，个人问题也解决了。”正是带着这种卑鄙的个人目的，他投机钻营，混入了革命队伍，而且利用他篡夺的党和国家的重要职权，到处推销资产阶级的私货，为资本主义在中国复辟开辟道路。这不正是在公私“溶化”的幌子下以私溶公吗？
      “为了党和革命的利益而钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康……”为了保住几条狗命，他指使自己的娄罗自首变节，不惜出卖无产阶级的革命事业。这不正是在公私“溶化”的幌子下，以私溶公吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫的公私“溶化”论，同“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学完全是一路货色。这一点，他自己在一九六○年二月的一次谈话中解释得很清楚。他说：“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益即无整体利益，个人利益集中起来即是集体利益。……因此，不是大公无私，而是大公有私，公私兼顾，先公后私。”
    字字扣紧一个“私”字，句句突出“个人利益”。这就是他的“公”“私”观，这就是他的资产阶级世界观的“精髓”！
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。因此，自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的；而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干的精神，才是可尊敬的。”
    马克思主义并不否定个人利益的存在。但是，我们必须象毛主席所教导的那样，使个人利益服从于阶级的和人民的利益。为了巩固和发展社会主义的政治制度和经济制度，我们必须提倡一心为公的观念，用大公无私的共产主义精神来要求自己，激励他人。而决不能象中国赫鲁晓夫那样，到处散布资产阶级利己主义的毒素。
      “没有个人利益即无整体利益”，“社会主义、集体主义不能离开个人的利益。”在这个资产阶级唯我主义者的眼中，个人利益就是一切，一切都是为了个人。什么集体利益，什么社会主义，全都是不可捉摸的抽象概念，而唯独个人和私有财产才是实在的东西。这完全是资产阶级极端个人主义者的心声。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想告诉我们，无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己，离开了无产阶级和全体劳动人民的利益，离开了社会主义的集体利益，根本就不可能有什么抽象的、独立的个人利益。
      “个人利益集中起来即是集体利益。”这是中国赫鲁晓夫象魔术师一样玩弄的数学游戏。他把个人主义和集体主义这两个本质不同的东西通过量的关系等同起来，这实际上是用个人利益抹杀集体利益。
      集体利益，是广大劳动人民的共同利益。它反映无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，而决不是个人利益的机械的总和。集体利益永远高于个人利益。这两者之间的关系怎么能用简单的数量关系来代替呢？难道每个人都孜孜追求个人利益，集中起来就能构成社会主义的集体利益吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫的这种荒唐可笑的逻辑，使人联想起十九世纪英国资产阶级功利主义者沁边的一句“名言”。他说：“个人利益是唯一现实的利益”，“社会利益只是一种抽象，它不过是个人利益的总和”。
      “无可奈何花落去，似曾相识燕归来。”中国赫鲁晓夫的“公”“私”观，同这个十九世纪的资产阶级政客的“公”“私”观，又何其相似乃尔！
    永远高举斗私批修的战斗旗帜
    最近，我们的伟大领袖毛主席，向全国人民发出了战斗号召：要斗私，批修。这是毛主席根据无产阶级专政时期阶级斗争的规律，根据社会主义和资本主义在意识形态方面斗争的特点而提出的伟大历史任务。它给了中国赫鲁晓夫及其所代表的资产阶级思想体系以毁灭性的打击。
    早在一百多年前，科学共产主义的奠基人马克思和恩格斯，就在他们合著的划时代的伟大历史文献《共产党宣言》中英明地断言：“共产主义革命就是同传统的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；毫不奇怪，它在自己的发展进程中要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂。”
    阶级斗争的实践告诉我们，生产资料私有制被消灭以后，反映私有制存在的私有观念并不是很快就会灭亡的。这种私有观念就象侵入人体内的细菌一样，如果不消灭它，它就会毒害我们的肌体。正如林彪同志所说：“剥削阶级意识形态的存在和影响，最后势必要恢复维护私有制的旧政权。”
    苏联以及其他一些社会主义国家发生资本主义复辟的历史教训雄辩地证明：无产阶级要取得社会主义革命的完全胜利，不仅必须用暴力摧毁资产阶级的国家机器，不仅必须彻底消灭生产资料的资本主义所有制，而且必须同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的反动思想进行长期的艰苦斗争，必须同维护私有制的传统观念、同头脑中的“私”字实行最彻底的决裂。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级反动思想体系的最顽固的维护者和最积极的宣传者。中国赫鲁晓夫起劲地宣扬“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学和陈腐不堪的公私“溶化”论，就是企图用封建主义、资本主义的反动思想腐蚀群众，征服人心，为资本主义复辟作准备。
    正因为这样，我们要搞好斗私，就必须用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判他的资产阶级利己主义，彻底批判他所宣扬的“吃小亏，占大便宜”和所谓公私“溶化”论。
    正因为这样，我们要搞好批修，就必须用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，集中力量把修正主义的总头目——中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，同时深入开展各部门、各单位的斗、批、改，彻底肃清修正主义在各条战线上的流毒。
    马克思在他的《政治经济学批判序言》中曾经说过：“随着经济基础的变更，全部庞大的上层建筑也或慢或快地发生变革。”不管剥削阶级的意识形态多么根深蒂固，但它已经象没落的沉舟和腐朽的病树，必将按照历史的辩证法走向彻底灭亡。而无产阶级的共产主义世界观，却象千帆竞发的航船和春意葱茏的万木，永远充满着不可战胜的力量。
    让中国赫鲁晓夫的“私”字经和形形色色的资产阶级利己主义的肮脏“理论”，都统统见鬼去吧！我们将永远高举斗私，批修的战斗旗帜，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去开辟一个红彤彤的共产主义新世界！
