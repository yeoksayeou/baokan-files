In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line concocted by the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, some cadres in our mine did not keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and made mistakes. They carried heavy ideological burdens and dared not work boldly, which affected mine production for a period.

After Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued the great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," the cadres in our mine, especially those who had made mistakes, were deeply moved and educated. We proletarian revolutionaries studied Chairman Mao's works with them and helped them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After studying, many cadres had a change of heart. Some cadres said in their self-criticism: In the past, I was hindered by the character "fear," blocked by the character "private," my thoughts lagged behind the masses, I dared not approach the masses, and I dared not work boldly, which led to passive production and betrayed the trust of the masses and the Party's cultivation. I feel very heartbroken. Some cadres expressed: I must put down my burden, start the machine, and create new merits for the people.

After the study ended, cadres rushed to the mine. In the relationship between cadres and the masses, a new atmosphere of "two initiatives and one boldness" emerged. "Two initiatives" means that revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses actively seek out cadres to have heart-to-heart talks, supporting them in boldly directing production; cadres actively seek out proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses to open their hearts, expressing their determination to stand on the side of the revolutionaries and work together with the broad revolutionary masses to grasp the revolution and promote production. "One boldness" means that cadres dare to boldly direct production, praising when they should praise and criticizing when they should criticize. Their transformation and approach also serve as an inspiration to cadres who have always stood with the proletarian revolutionaries during the movement, and their enthusiasm is even higher. Many comrades said: We must demand more of ourselves and never detach from the masses. Some comrades, though physically weak, always insist on going down the mine to participate in labor and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. The broad masses of workers in the mine see such a harmonious relationship between cadres and the masses and are very happy.

Now, based on the liberation of a large number of cadres, our mine, through group discussions, has rectified and improved the production leadership teams at all levels and established a production office to unify the command of the entire mine. After this new production leadership team was established, it immediately divided into three groups, went to the production front line, and together with the broad masses, sought out and solved key production problems. In recent times, mine production has been steadily rising.

### 放手使用革命干部

    放手使用革命干部
    在文化大革命初期，由于党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派炮制的资产阶级反动路线的影响，我们矿有一部分干部没有能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，犯了错误。他们背上思想包袱，不敢大胆工作，矿井生产一度受到影响。
    毛主席、党中央发出“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召后，对我们矿的干部，特别是对犯错误的干部，触动很大，教育很深。我们无产阶级革命派和他们一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。许多干部经过学习，思想都有了转变，有的干部在进行自我批评时说：从前我是怕字当头，私字拦路，思想落后于群众，不敢接近群众，不敢大胆工作，造成生产被动，辜负了群众的信任和党的培养，自己感到十分痛心。有的干部表示：一定要放下包袱，开动机器，为人民立新功。
    学习一结束，干部纷纷深入矿井，在干群关系上出现了“两主动”、“一大胆”的新气象。“两主动”就是革命派和广大革命职工主动找干部谈心，支持他们大胆指挥生产；干部主动找无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工交心，表示坚决站在革命派一边，和广大革命职工一起抓好革命，搞好生产。“一大胆”就是干部敢于大胆指挥生产，该表扬的表扬，该批评的批评。他们的这种转变和作法，对在运动中一直同无产阶级革命派站在一起的干部也是一种激励，他们的干劲更高了。许多同志说：我们一定要更严格地要求自己，永远不脱离群众。有的同志身体较弱，但是始终坚持下井参加劳动，虚心听取群众的意见。矿上的广大职工，看到干群关系这样融洽，都非常高兴。
    现在，我们矿在解放大批干部的基础上，通过群众讨论，整顿和健全了各级生产领导班子，并组成了统一指挥全矿的生产办公室。这个新的生产领导班子建立起来后，立即分成三个小组，深入到生产第一线，和广大群众一起，寻找和解决生产中的关键问题。最近以来，全矿生产一直稳步上升。
