The heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in sabotaging Sino-Indonesian relations

The fascist military clique led by Suharto and Nasution, after committing a series of savage anti-Chinese atrocities, brazenly demanded that China close its embassy and consulates in Indonesia and withdraw all personnel from its diplomatic missions. The Chinese government has issued a solemn statement, strongly condemning the anti-Chinese actions of the Indonesian reactionary government, and deciding to temporarily close the Chinese embassy and consulates in Indonesia and withdraw all personnel from the diplomatic missions. The Chinese people are outraged and strongly protest the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in sabotaging the relations between the two countries!

The Indonesian reactionaries have reached the peak of their anti-Chinese frenzy. However, they have the audacity to claim that it is China that is "deliberately worsening relations between the two countries." You think you can shift the blame with your shameless lies, but that is absolutely impossible!

The deterioration of Sino-Indonesian relations to the current state is entirely the doing of the Indonesian reactionary government. After the fascist military clique in Indonesia staged a counter-revolutionary coup in October 1965, they systematically launched waves of violent anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment. They mobilized the entire country's propaganda machinery to viciously slander, defame, and attack the People's Republic of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, whom the Chinese people love and respect the most. They dispatched large numbers of armed military police and thugs to brutally attack our diplomatic missions in Indonesia 43 times, resulting in nearly 70 Chinese diplomatic personnel being beaten and shot. They illegally seized our diplomatic mission's offices and residences, flagrantly violating the diplomatic privileges of our diplomatic missions. They carried out inhuman racial persecution against the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia, burning their homes, looting their property, smashing their shops, and imprisoning tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in concentration camps and prisons. A large number of overseas Chinese were brutally murdered. The Indonesian reactionary government trampled on the most basic principles of international relations, committing rare fascist atrocities in the history of international relations. Your crimes are heinous and evident, how can you escape responsibility?

Moreover, the Indonesian reactionary government has openly colluded with the political corpse Chiang Kai-shek, who is despised by the Chinese people. They frequently meet with officials from the Chiang clique and publicly declare their intention to "recognize" the Chiang clique. This is a serious political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people and ironclad evidence of their deliberate sabotage of Sino-Indonesian relations.

The anti-Chinese frenzy and sabotage of Sino-Indonesian relations by the Indonesian reactionaries led by Suharto and Nasution are determined by their reactionary class nature and are the inevitable result of their small clique of fascist military personnel implementing policies of selling out the country, dictatorship, anti-communism, anti-people, and counter-revolution.

This fascist military clique is the representative of the feudal landlords, bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie in Indonesia, the most decadent, brutal, and reactionary force, and the executioner of the revolutionary people. As soon as they came to power, they carried out mass arrests and massacres, bloodbaths in the archipelago. They have oppressed and plundered the Indonesian people, pushing them into a state of deep water and fire. To divert the attention of the domestic people, the Indonesian reactionary government resorted to anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment.

This fascist military clique is a traitor and a loyal dog of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Their fascist regime was established in a counter-revolutionary military coup planned by U.S. imperialism. As soon as they came to power, they sold out Indonesia's independence and sovereignty, begging for dollars and rubles from the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. They rushed to sell themselves to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and inevitably became anti-Chinese running dogs for them.

The Indonesian reactionaries' current escalation of anti-Chinese frenzy is instigated by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists and is part of their recent wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in Asia. The more ferocious the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-Chinese actions, the more vigorously the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists support and encourage them. The U.S. imperialists have already promised to provide the Indonesian reactionaries with an $80 million loan this year. The Soviet revisionists have also agreed to extend the repayment of a $1.2 billion debt and interest to the Indonesian reactionaries. The U.S. and Soviet revisionists also continuously provide military "aid" to the Indonesian reactionaries. The Indonesian reactionaries' sabotage of Sino-Indonesian diplomatic relations is in line with the needs of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

The fascist regime in Indonesia, built on a foundation of bloodshed, is extremely unstable. It faces serious political and economic crises at home, with numerous difficulties, like sitting on a volcano, anxious and unable to endure. It completely relies on the support of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to survive and desperately seeks to ally with the most decadent counter-revolutionary scum, such as the "Malaysia" Rahman clique and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, to bolster its courage. It is extremely afraid of revolutionary China, viewing it as a thorn in the eye and a splinter in the flesh, and deliberately sabotaging Sino-Indonesian diplomatic relations. This precisely reflects its weakness.

The Indonesian reactionaries' severance of Sino-Indonesian diplomatic relations does not harm the People's Republic of China in the slightest, absolutely cannot block the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and cannot destroy the great fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia. In the long struggle against imperialism and colonialism, our two peoples have always supported and inspired each other. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people have consistently actively supported the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles. The entire diplomatic staff of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, making active contributions to supporting the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle and strengthening the fighting friendship between the two peoples. The Indonesian reactionaries' plot to sabotage the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia is doomed to fail. The heinous crimes committed by the Indonesian reactionaries against the Indonesian people and the Chinese people must be thoroughly settled!

The broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia are good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and the flesh and blood of the Chinese people. For a long time, they have lived in harmony with the Indonesian people and have shared weal and woe and fought side by side in the struggle against imperialist aggression. The broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese, in order to safeguard the dignity of their motherland, protect their legitimate rights and interests, and maintain the friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia, have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the Indonesian reactionary government. Many overseas Chinese have written heroic epics with their blood and lives. Their struggle is just, and the Indonesian people and people around the world sympathize with and support them. The great socialist motherland firmly supports them. The Chinese government has solemnly declared: Although the Indonesian reactionary government has sabotaged the relations between the two countries, the Chinese government and people will continue to take all necessary and possible measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. We are confident that the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely with the Indonesian people, and fight to the end to smash the racial persecution of the Indonesian reactionary regime.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The rampancy of all internal and external dark forces has caused national disasters; but such rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows that they are in their last struggles, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory." The various persecutions inflicted by the Indonesian reactionaries on the Indonesian people will inevitably promote a broader and more intense revolution among the Indonesian people, accelerating the arrival of the revolutionary high tide in Indonesia. The Indonesian people, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, are currently regrouping their forces and launching new battles. They have deeply understood from the lessons of blood the unshakable truth taught by the great leader Chairman Mao that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and are determined to follow the path of the Chinese revolution. We are confident that no matter what difficulties and twists and turns the Indonesian people may encounter on their forward march, the revolutionary tide is irresistible. Darkness will surely pass, and dawn is just ahead. The brilliant sunshine will surely shine over the land of Indonesia, and the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Indonesian people!

### 印尼反动派破坏中国印尼两国关系的滔天罪行

    印尼反动派破坏中国印尼两国关系的滔天罪行
    以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的印尼法西斯军人集团，在干了一连串野蛮的反华暴行之后，悍然要求中国关闭驻印尼的大使馆和领事馆，撤回驻印尼的使领馆全部人员。我国政府已发表严正声明，强烈谴责印尼反动政府的反华行径，决定暂时关闭驻印尼大使馆和领事馆，并且撤回使领馆全部人员。中国人民对于印尼反动派破坏两国关系的滔天罪行，表示最大的愤慨和最强烈的抗议！
    印尼反动派猖狂反华，已经到了登峰造极的程度。然而，它却倒打一耙，叫嚷什么是中国“蓄意恶化两国关系”。你们想用凭空捏造的无耻谎言来推卸自己的罪责，这是绝对办不到的！
    中国印尼两国关系恶化到目前这种地步，完全是印尼反动政府一手造成的。印尼法西斯军人集团在一九六五年十月发动反革命政变后，就有计划地多次掀起狂暴的反华排华浪潮。它在全国范围内开动宣传机器，对中华人民共和国和中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，进行恶毒的诬蔑、诽谤和攻击。它出动大批武装军警和暴徒，野蛮袭击我国驻印尼代表机构达四十三次之多，前后近七十名中国外交人员遭到毒打和枪击。它非法霸占我国代表机构的办公处所和宿舍，肆无忌惮地侵犯我国代表机构的外交特权。它对旅居印尼广大爱国华侨进行了灭绝人性的种族主义迫害，焚烧华侨房屋，掠夺华侨财产，捣毁华侨商店，把成千上万的华侨关进集中营和监狱，大批华侨惨遭杀害。印尼反动政府恣意践踏国际关系的最起码的准则，制造了国际关系史上少有的法西斯暴行。你们的血债累累，罪恶昭彰，怎么能赖得掉呢？
    不仅如此，印尼反动政府还同被中国人民唾弃的政治僵尸蒋匪帮明目张胆地进行勾结。它同蒋匪帮官员频繁接触，并且公开叫嚷要“承认”蒋匪帮。这是对七亿中国人民的严重政治挑衅，是蓄意破坏中国印尼两国关系的铁证。
    以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动派疯狂反华，破坏中国印尼两国关系，这是由他们的反动阶级本性决定的，是他们这一小撮法西斯军人集团执行卖国、独裁、反共、反人民、反革命政策的必然结果。
    这个法西斯军人集团，是印尼封建地主、官僚买办资产阶级的总代表，是最腐朽、最残暴、最反动的势力，是屠杀革命人民的刽子手。他们一上台，就进行了大逮捕、大屠杀，血洗了千岛之国。他们对印尼人民进行了敲骨吸髓的压榨和穷凶极恶的掠夺，使印尼人民处于水深火热之中。为了转移国内人民的视线，印尼反动政府就乞灵于反华排华。
    这个法西斯军人集团，是地地道道的卖国贼，是美帝苏修所豢养的忠实走狗。他们的法西斯政权，本来就是在美帝国主义策划的反革命军事政变中建立起来的。他们一上台，就大肆拍卖印尼的独立和主权，向美帝苏修乞讨美元和卢布。他们加紧卖身投靠美帝苏修，就必然地要充当美帝苏修的反华走卒。
    印尼反动派目前变本加厉地疯狂反华，是美帝苏修在背后策动的，是它们最近一个时期在亚洲掀起的反华浪潮的一部分。印尼反动政府反华愈是猖狂，美帝苏修就愈加起劲地为它输血，给它打气。美帝国主义已经许诺今年将给予印尼反动派八千万美元的贷款。苏修也答应印尼反动派延期偿还十二亿美元的巨额债款和利息。美帝和苏修还不断地向印尼反动派提供军事“援助”。印尼反动派破坏中国印尼两国外交关系，就是适应美帝苏修的需要。
    建立在血腥统治基础上的印尼法西斯政权，是极端不稳定的。它在国内面临严重政治经济危机，困难重重，就象坐在火山口上一样，惶惶不可终日。它完全依赖美帝苏修的支撑过日子，并且拚命拉拢“马来西亚”拉赫曼集团、台湾蒋介石匪帮等等最腐朽的一些反革命渣滓来为自己壮胆。它对革命的中国害怕到了极点，视之为眼中钉、肉中刺，因而蓄意破坏中国印尼两国的外交关系。这恰恰反映了它的虚弱性。
    印尼反动派中断中国印尼两国的外交关系，这丝毫无损于中华人民共和国，绝对阻挡不了毛泽东思想的万丈光芒，破坏不了中国印尼两国人民之间的伟大的战斗友谊。在长期反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争中，我们两国人民一直是互相支持，互相鼓舞。中国人民在伟大毛泽东思想指导下，一贯积极支持印尼人民的反帝反殖斗争。我国驻印尼大使馆的全体外交人员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在支持印尼人民的革命斗争，加强两国人民之间的战斗友谊方面，也作出了积极的贡献。印尼反动派破坏中国印尼两国人民传统友谊的阴谋，是绝对不能得逞的。印尼反动派对印尼人民和中国人民犯下的滔天罪行，一定要彻底清算！
    侨居印尼的广大爱国华侨，是中华民族的好儿女，是中国人民的亲骨肉。长期以来，他们同印尼人民友好相处，在反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争中，患难与共，并肩战斗。广大爱国华侨为了维护祖国的尊严，维护自己的正当权益，维护中国印尼两国人民的友谊，同印尼反动政府进行了英勇顽强的斗争。不少华侨以自己的鲜血和生命写下了气壮山河的英雄诗篇。他们的斗争是正义的，印尼人民和全世界人民同情和支持他们，伟大的社会主义祖国坚决支持他们。中国政府已庄严宣布：尽管印尼反动政府破坏了两国关系，中国政府和中国人民将继续采取一切必要和可能的措施，保护华侨的正当权益。我们坚信，广大爱国华侨一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加紧密地和印尼人民团结在一起，为粉碎印尼反动政权的种族主义迫害而斗争到底。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”印尼反动派对印尼人民所作的种种迫害，必将促进印尼人民更广泛更剧烈的革命，加速印尼人民革命高潮的到来。有着光荣的革命传统的印尼人民，目前正在重新集结力量，展开新的战斗。他们从血的教训中深刻地认识了伟大领袖毛主席教导的“枪杆子里面出政权”这一颠扑不破的真理，决心走中国革命的道路。我们坚信，不管印尼人民在前进的道路上还会遇到什么样的困难和曲折，革命的潮流是势不可挡的。黑暗终将过去，曙光就在前头。灿烂的阳光必将普照印尼的大地，最后的胜利一定属于英雄的印尼人民！
