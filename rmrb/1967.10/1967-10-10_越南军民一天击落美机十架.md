The heroic military and civilians of North Vietnam achieved a glorious victory on October 7 by shooting down ten American aggressor aircraft in a single day. In the morning at 8:00 AM, a group of American aggressor aircraft invaded the skies over Hanoi. The Vietnamese People's Air Force and local civilians, who were well-prepared, immediately launched a counterattack, shooting down three enemy aircraft in just a few minutes.

In the afternoon, around 3:00 PM, the Vietnamese People's Air Force, with the support of ground artillery, shot down three more invading American aggressor aircraft over the skies of Bac Ninh Province.

The General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army sent a letter to the Vietnamese People's Air Force units, congratulating them on their two victories in one day.

On the same day, the military and civilians of Ha Tay, Nghe An, Hai Phong, and Ninh Binh also shot down one American aircraft each.
