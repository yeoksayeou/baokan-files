Japanese newspapers have reported that under the rule of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, the Soviet Union today is permeated with capitalist stench in all aspects of social life. Recently, two articles published in the Japanese bourgeois newspapers *Asahi Shimbun* and *Bungei Shunju* revealed some capitalist phenomena in Soviet society.

*Asahi Shimbun* published a report by its special correspondent, Kimura, from Moscow, titled "The Soviet Union is advancing on the road to Westernization."

Kimura reported that upon arriving in Moscow, his first impression was that the capital was "more liberalized and Westernized than expected." He said, "In the grand hotels of Moscow, guests dance wildly to the jazz band's twist music. Among the dancers, one can see women wearing backless evening gowns." He added, "Parisian fashions can become popular in Moscow within a month."

The report stated, "In the streets of Copenhagen, one can see flyers saying 'Yankees out of Vietnam!' But after a week in Moscow, I have not seen any slogans about Vietnam."

*Bungei Shunju* published an article by Professor Hayato Hayashita of Tokyo University discussing his impressions from a visit to the Soviet Union. He said that in the Soviet Union, "bribery is most effective." Japanese businessmen found their negotiations with Soviet counterparts repeatedly delayed because they could not meet the managers of Soviet state-owned enterprises. Later, they gave gifts brought from Japan to the managers' secretaries. Soon, "the secretary came running to say, 'The manager will see you immediately.'" Hayashita said, "In the Soviet Union, problems that cannot be solved through ordinary channels can be easily resolved if one has good relations with higher-ups. ... Ultimately, money is an accessory to friendship."

The article listed various facts, introducing how the Soviet revisionists are "busy collecting dollars." "First, there are the so-called 'dollar stores' and hotel bars. If you go to the basement of a hotel, you will find a completely American-style bar. Here, Soviet currency, the ruble, is completely unusable."

The article stated, "Walking on the streets, day or night, we foreigners will encounter black market dealers approaching us saying, 'Sell me something.' There are many people buying dollars on the black market." Hayashita said that since the Soviet government has set up 'dollar stores,' "such phenomena are inevitable."

### 日本报刊说  苏修“比预料的更西欧化”

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

    日本报刊说
    苏修“比预料的更西欧化”
    在勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团统治下的苏联，今天在社会生活的各个方面，都散发着资本主义的臭气。日本资产阶级报刊《朝日新闻》和《文艺春秋》不久前发表的两篇文章，透露了一些苏联社会的资本主义现象。
    《朝日新闻》刊登了该报特派记者木村发自莫斯科的一篇报道，标题是《苏联正在西欧化的大道上前进》。
    木村报道说，他到莫斯科后，得到的第一个印象就是这个首都“比预料的更自由化，更西欧化”。他说，在莫斯科的大饭店里，客人们随着“爵士乐队吹奏的扭摆舞曲在狂扭乱摇。在跳舞的人群中，可以看到穿着大露背晚礼服的女人”。“巴黎流行的东西，一个月内就可以在莫斯科流行起来。”
    报道说，“在哥本哈根的大街上，看到过‘美国佬滚出越南！’的传单，但是，我到莫斯科已经一周，在市内还没有看到过关于越南的标语牌。”
    《文艺春秋》登载了东京大学教授林健太郎谈他访苏观感的文章说，在苏联“贿赂最有效”。日本商人同苏方商业谈判一再拖延，原因是怎么也见不到苏联国营公司的经理，后来他们把从日本带来的礼物送给了经理的女秘书。很快，“这位秘书跑来说，经理马上会见你。”在苏联“通过普通途径总也解决不了的问题，只要同上面的人搞好关系，问题就能简单地得到解决。……归根到底，金钱就是交情的附属品”。
    文章列举了种种事实，介绍了苏修正在“为了搜集美元而疲于奔命”。“第一就是所谓‘美元商店’和旅馆里的酒巴间。如果再到旅馆的地下室去看看，那里有完全美式的酒巴间。”“在这里，苏联的货币卢布是完全不能通用的”。
    文章说，“在街上走走，不分昼夜，我们这些外国人，就会遇到黑市商人挨到身边说：卖给我东西吧。在黑市买美元的人是很多的。”林健太郎说，苏联政府既然设置“美元商店”，“发生这种现象也是必然的”。
