The head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique within the former Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, this once-renowned "giant," has been pulled down from his horse and knocked to the ground by the billions of soldiers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Peng Zhen is an enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat. For seventeen years, he has colluded with the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, acting in cahoots and engaging in frenzied opposition and vicious attacks against the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and establish bourgeois dictatorship.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamental issue of the proletarian revolution. Peng Zhen's desperate opposition to the dictatorship of the proletariat is the greatest betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and the greatest betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Proclaiming the "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle," Abolishing the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

Chairman Mao teaches us: In a socialist society, "class struggle has not ended. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between various political forces, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." "In society, there are still some people who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They will fight against the working class from all angles, including the ideological struggle."

The enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Peng Zhen, closely follows the heels of the Chinese Khrushchev, vigorously advocating the "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle." He keeps shouting: "Classes within the country have been eliminated," "landlords, rich peasants, and Huang Shiren have changed," all have become "cooperative members." "The bourgeoisie seeks reform, seeks to be eliminated." Capitalists no longer "seek profit," all have become "laborers." "Class struggle has basically ended, domestic counter-revolutionary remnants have also been basically eliminated." "The contradiction between socialism and capitalism," "the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been basically resolved," "the revolution has been basically completed." This means that classes have been eliminated, class struggle has been extinguished, the revolution has reached its end, and the world is in harmony! This is purely a counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy!

Peng Zhen and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocate the "Theory of the Extinction of Class Struggle," with the sole purpose of lulling the proletariat and the working people into a state of complacency, making them, as he hopes, "sleep soundly in the thatched cottage," so that all class enemies can swarm out and launch a ferocious attack on the proletariat, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and restore capitalism!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our current task is to strengthen the state machine of the people, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to consolidate national defense and protect the interests of the people." However, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, Peng Zhen, does the opposite, vigorously advocating the theory of the extinction of the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, he vigorously advocates that "the functions of our state's dictatorship have now begun to move in the direction of negation," "after the transformation of bourgeois ownership, the country enters a new stage where the functions of dictatorship are greatly weakened," and that it is necessary to "timely, gradually, and appropriately reduce the scope and functions of domestic dictatorship," and so on.

Peng Zhen's theory of the "weakening and reduction of the functions of the proletarian state dictatorship" is a replica of Khrushchev's heresy that "the dictatorship of the proletariat is no longer necessary in the Soviet Union." He attempts to make the proletariat lose vigilance, to "put away the swords and release the horses to the south of the mountains," so that he and his accomplices can suddenly strike one night, while the proletariat is left empty-handed.

Peng Zhen blathers on about how "you emphasize, even more strongly emphasize the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which will inevitably expand the dictatorship and suppression." Oh my! What a big "crime"! The dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the revolutionary masses over the class enemies, armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The eyes of the billions of revolutionary masses are sharp; they dictate accurately and suppress correctly. Peng Zhen's vicious waving of the "expansion of dictatorship and suppression" hat is nothing to be afraid of. It not only fails to make the proletariat retreat half a step from the position of strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, but on the contrary, it makes people more aware that it is necessary to dictate and suppress a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who hang the Communist Party's sign, and absolutely not to let them roam free.

Using the bourgeois slogans of "democracy" and "equality" to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat

Chairman Mao teaches us: "These two aspects, the democratic aspect within the people and the dictatorial aspect over the reactionaries, combined together, are the people's democratic dictatorship." The proletariat, relying on the powerful weapon of the dictatorship of the proletariat, leads the broad masses of laborers to forge ahead, overcome difficulties, defeat enemies, and open up new horizons for communism. However, Peng Zhen, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, picks up two pieces of junk weapons from the old revisionists, "pure democracy" and "class equality," and launches a fierce attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In 1953, when our people were vigorously advancing the general line of socialist revolution, launching a fierce attack on urban and rural capitalism, and further consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, Peng Zhen followed the example of the Chinese Khrushchev, stepping in the footsteps of Kautsky's great anti-Bolshevik "terrorism," shouting and screaming about the need for "democratization." He said: "In politics, this year we will begin to implement ... democratization." Democratization without class distinction and without talking about dictatorship over the enemy is a thoroughly reactionary bourgeois slogan. Democracy is a class concept. In a class society, there is bourgeois democracy, but there is no proletarian democracy. To bourgeois democracy is to the dictatorship of the proletariat. Peng Zhen does not mention which class's democracy, does not talk about dictatorship over class enemies at all, but talks about abstract "democratization," which is a complete replica of Kautsky's "pure democracy," with the purpose of talking about democracy to the landlord bourgeoisie and implementing dictatorship over the proletariat.

In 1954, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen, using the sacred podium of the proletariat at the First National People's Congress, further proposed the slogan of "equality before the law." This is a thoroughly bourgeois slogan. The law is a tool for the ruling class to implement dictatorship. As long as there is a law, it is impossible to talk about "legal equality" among classes. "Equality before the law" is another way of saying "class equality." "Class equality" is a tune sung to death by the representatives of the bourgeoisie, whose purpose is to cover up the privileges of the exploiters. In fact, as long as there are classes, there can be no "class equality." Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the relationship between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is not one of "equality," but one of class oppression, that is, the dictatorship and domination of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie. Peng Zhen even proposed: "The Communist Party has ××× ten thousand, landlords, rich peasants, capitalists have ××× ten thousand, each has their own opinions, what if they don't speak out?" Obviously, this is to make the bourgeoisie "equal" to the proletariat, landlords and rich peasants "equal" to poor and lower-middle peasants, class enemies "equal" to revolutionary people. If the classes in a socialist society are all equal, as Peng Zhen advocates, then the dictatorship of the proletariat would not become a "dictatorship of class equality"? And this so-called "dictatorship of class equality" is not a thorough bourgeois dictatorship disguised as a beautiful and charming "equality" curtain?

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen not only advocates the fallacies of bourgeois "democracy" and "equality," but also acts according to these fallacies. On the one hand, he practices benevolent rule over class enemies, implements peaceful land reform, vigorously shields counter-revolutionary elements, desperately nurtures bourgeois forces, pulls Trotskyites, traitors, spies, and bullies into the Party, and stuffs them into key departments. On the other hand, he incites ghosts and snakes to launch a ferocious attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat. Before the anti-rightist struggle, he, under the guise of "fully developing democracy," incited the bourgeoisie to sing "duets" with the proletariat, urging bourgeois parties to fight for "independence," "equality," and "freedom" with the Communist Party. During the three years of difficulty, he again bewitched people by saying, "In recent years, there have been some problems in the democratic life within the Party, we blow what we have," openly instructing ghosts and snakes to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1965, when Chairman Mao led the proletarian revolutionaries to counterattack the bourgeoisie's ferocious onslaught, he again threw out the reactionary slogan of "equality before truth," covering up the bourgeoisie's continued attack and obstructing the counterattack of the proletarian revolutionaries. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen is thus attempting to completely "overcome" the dictatorship of the proletariat as so-called "bureaucratism" and "dark side." He insists on selecting "dead rightists" into the leadership of the dictatorship of the proletariat according to his so-called "democratic" principles, to hold the national seal. Is this not an attempt to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a bourgeois dictatorship?

Under the guise of managing "production" and "construction," he actually undermines the dictatorship of the proletariat

Chairman Mao teaches us that the proletariat's "first function of dictatorship is to suppress the reactionary classes, reactionaries, and exploiters within the state who resist the socialist revolution, and those who sabotage socialist construction." Therefore, the primary task of the dictatorship of the proletariat is to exercise the power of suppression. However, Peng Zhen, talking about production on the left and construction on the right, never mentions suppressing the enemy, and with ulterior motives, depicts managing "production" and "construction" as the primary or sole task of the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1950, when the proletariat's power in our country had just been established and had not yet vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries, he advocated the reactionary fallacy of "production above all else," saying, "The word production has been said a lot, it's okay to say it a lot, it should be said ten thousand times, if ten thousand times are not enough, say ten thousand and one times, everything should serve production." In 1953, when the great revolutionary mass movement to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, with the three transformations as the center, was in full swing, he again brazenly declared, "In the future, the main task of our political and legal work will be to protect and promote the further development of social productive forces." In 1957, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, he went even further, advocating that the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat "in the future will mainly fight against nature, engage in production struggle, and socialist construction." Peng Zhen's entire set of fallacies, completely ignoring the dictatorship of the proletariat, putting managing "production" and "construction" above everything else, is a thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy. The Chinese Khrushchev once shouted: "The work of state construction is the central work of our Party nationwide, (transfer) the focus of Party and League work to state construction.... There will be no more major movements in the future, the main thing is to concentrate on economic construction." The modern revisionist clique in the Soviet Union also blathers on about: "The main function of a socialist state is to organize economic and cultural education functions." Peng Zhen's counter-revolutionary rhetoric is of the same ilk.

The state of the dictatorship of the proletariat has the task and function of managing production and construction, but this is not the primary task and function, the primary task and function can only be the exercise of the power of suppression over the enemy. Because if the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat does not suppress the various sabotage activities of the landlord bourgeoisie, the socialist revolution and socialist construction will not be able to proceed. If the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat does not implement dictatorship over the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, this small handful of people, who appear respectable and smiling on the surface but are actually ruthless killers, will dictate over the proletariat, kill our heads, change the color of the country, alter the nature of the state, and destroy the achievements of socialism in an instant, allowing capitalism to return.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is as if there is no soul." However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen does the opposite, openly placing managing "production" and "construction" above politics. If according to the advocacy of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplice Peng Zhen, the proletariat does not engage in politics, does not engage in class struggle, does not exercise the power of suppression over class enemies, and buries its head in economic construction, indulging in production affairs, only focusing on grain, cotton, and oil, without distinguishing between enemies and friends, then it will open the door for the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into a bourgeois dictatorship. Whether it is the Soviet revisionist traitor clique or Peng Zhen and his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, they often use the guise of managing "production" and "construction" to carry out the actual coup d'état and restoration of capitalism. Their conspiracies have been foiled, and their counter-revolutionary faces have been exposed to the world.

Advocating a "People's State," Implementing Bourgeois Dictatorship

Marxism-Leninism holds that the state is a tool of class struggle and a machine of class suppression. However, Peng Zhen, in order to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, depicts the state as a super-class, all-people's state, using the banner of the "People's State" to implement bourgeois dictatorship.

He blathers on about how "our state is an organization where everyone manages everyone, and everyone is managed by everyone," an agency that "leads and organizes the material and cultural life of the public," a world without contradictions, classes, and class struggle, like a "glass plate" or "crystal stone." In 1958, he openly declared that our "power is of a national nature." In 1963, in order to quickly "break through" the dictatorship of the proletariat, during the "pilot" in Shijingshan, he gave the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat two "definitions," saying that our state power is an organization that "solves the problem of leaders and (the) masses," a "housekeeper."

Look, in these "definitions" of the state, the opposing classes have disappeared, leaving only "everyone," "the public," "leaders and (the) masses," and other super-class, abstract people. In these "definitions" of the state, class dictatorship has also disappeared, leaving only "organizational life," "housekeeping," "solving problems," and other super-class, non-political things. This state, which does not distinguish classes, does not talk about the dictatorship of the proletariat, and treats all kinds of "everyone" and "the public" equally to "organize material and cultural life," "housekeeping," and "solve problems," is not a thorough "People's State"? This is not the same as the bourgeois claim that the state is an agency that "manages public affairs" and a tool for "achieving public welfare"? This is not the same as the bourgeois right-wing element Luo Longji's claim that "the purpose of the state is to seek the common happiness of all citizens"? This is not the same as Khrushchev's advocacy that "a socialist state is not the dictatorship of a class, but a tool of the whole society and all the people"?

The state is a tool for one class to oppress another class. Any state is a state of dictatorship of a certain class. The state and "all the people" are incompatible. The "People's State" has never existed, does not exist now, and will never exist in the future. As Engels pointed out, "To talk about a free people's state is pure nonsense: when the proletariat still needs the state, it needs the state not for freedom, but to suppress its enemies, and when it is possible to talk about freedom, the state itself no longer exists."

The bourgeoisie always hides its class position, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "and uses the term 'nation' to achieve the actual dictatorship of one class." Peng Zhen, this representative of the bourgeoisie, is selling bourgeois dictatorship under the guise of a "People's State."

It is under this tattered banner of the "People's State" that he recruits and accepts traitors, forms cliques, and brings in all kinds of ghosts and snakes under his command, turning the former Beijing Municipal Committee into a bourgeois independent kingdom that is impervious to water and needles.

It is under this tattered banner of the "People's State" that he turns all ghosts and snakes and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists into "masters of democratic dictatorship" from "objects of dictatorship," allowing them to do evil and counter-revolutionary acts.

It is under this tattered banner of the "People's State" that he proclaims "the bigger the capitalist, the better," "they listen even if they are obedient," "they should have positions and power." He wants people to "be a little more lenient towards landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements from all aspects," "treat rightists with medicine and kindness, and help them."

It is under this tattered banner of the "People's State" that he lets all kinds of poisonous weeds come out of their cages, flooding the capital's newspapers, magazines, stages, and screens. However, for the works of the proletarian revolutionaries, even if it is just a young shoot, he does not let it go, strangling it to death.

It is under this tattered banner of the "People's State" that he bestows the title of "leftist" on the great traitor Deng Tuo, and praises the "ancestor" of the 1930s films, Xia Yan, as a "good person," doing his utmost to shield them. For the proletarian revolutionaries, he readily labels them with the crime of "anti-Party," and even uses the organs of dictatorship, wishing to kill them.

Isn't all this completely proof that Peng Zhen's so-called "People's State" is actually a barefaced bourgeois dictatorship, fascist dictatorship?

Peng Zhen, who has long dominated the former Beijing Municipal Committee, has been engaged in his bourgeois dictatorship of the "People's State." He and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party have been scheming to turn it into a base for promoting bourgeois dictatorship nationwide and a forward position for a counter-revolutionary coup. For a long time, they have used various opportunities to carry out their evil activities of usurping the Party and the country. If their counter-revolutionary conspiracy succeeds, our country will change color, the landlord bourgeoisie will ride on the people's heads again, the achievements of the proletarian revolution will be in vain, and the heads of tens of millions of people will roll.

Our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao, personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world, smashing their conspiracy, destroying the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen, and exposing the Chinese Khrushchev. We proletarian revolutionaries must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize Peng Zhen, this enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat, along with his backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, criticize them down and stink them out, and thoroughly eliminate their poison. Let our revolutionary ship of the dictatorship of the proletariat, guided by the course set by Chairman Mao, ride the winds and break the waves, and forge ahead bravely!

　　打倒无产阶级专政的死敌彭真
　　中国科学院毛泽东思想法学研究所　革命大联合筹备委员会
    旧北京市委内反革命修正主义集团的头目彭真，这个显赫一时的“庞然大物”，已经被亿万无产阶级文化革命大军拉下马来，打翻在地了！
    这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    彭真是无产阶级专政的死敌。十七年来，他同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，相互勾结，狼狈为奸，疯狂反对和恶毒攻击无产阶级专政，妄图推翻无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政。
    无产阶级专政是无产阶级革命的根本问题。彭真拚死反对无产阶级专政，就是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的最大背叛，就是对无产阶级革命事业的最大背叛。
　　宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，取消无产阶级专政
    毛主席教导我们：在社会主义社会，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”“社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”
    无产阶级专政的死敌彭真，紧紧地跟在中国赫鲁晓夫的屁股后面，竭力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”。他一个劲儿叫嚷：“国内阶级消灭了”，“地主、富农、黄世仁已经变了”，统统变成“合作社社员”。“资产阶级要求改造，要求被消灭”了。资本家再也不“唯利是图”，“全成了劳动者”。“阶级斗争基本结束了，国内反革命残余也已经基本肃清”。“社会主义和资本主义的矛盾”，
  “无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾已基本解决”，“革命已经基本完成”。这就是说，阶级消灭了，阶级斗争熄灭了，革命已经到头，世界大同了！这纯粹是反革命修正主义的谬论！
    彭真和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，其目的不过是为了麻痹无产阶级和劳动人民，要他们象他所希望的那样来一个“草堂春睡足”，以便让一切阶级敌人倾巢而出，向无产阶级猖狂进攻，颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义罢了！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要地是指人民的军队、人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以巩固国防和保护人民利益。”彭真这个反革命修正主义分子却反其道而行之，拚命鼓吹无产阶级专政消亡论，妄图取消无产阶级专政。在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，他就竭力宣扬“我们国家的专政的功能，现在已经开始在向着它的否定方向推移”，“资产阶级所有制变革之后，国内进入一个专政功能大大削弱的新阶段”，必须“及时地、逐步地、恰如其分地缩小对国内专政的功能和范围”，等等。
    彭真的无产阶级国家“专政功能削弱、缩小”论，是赫鲁晓夫“无产阶级专政在苏联已经不再是必要的了”的邪说的翻版。他妄图以此使无产阶级丧失警惕，来一个“刀枪入库，马放南山”，以便他及其同党一天夜里突然杀了过来，而无产阶级则陷于赤手空拳的境地。
    彭真胡说什么：你们“照旧强调甚至更加强调”无产阶级国家的“专政功能，势必把专政和镇压扩大化”。哎呀呀！好大的“罪名”！无产阶级专政，是依靠革命群众对阶级敌人实行的专政。用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万革命群众的眼睛是雪亮的，他们专政专得准，镇压镇得对。彭真恶狠狠地挥舞“把专政和镇压扩大化”的帽子，是吓唬不了人的。它不但不能使无产阶级从强化无产阶级专政的立场上后退半步，相反，倒使人们更加认识到对彭真这样的一小撮挂着共产党招牌的反革命修正主义分子必须实行专政和镇压，绝对不能让他们逍遥法外。
    用资产阶级的“民主”、“平等”的口号，反对无产阶级专政
    毛主席教导我们：“这两方面，对人民内部的民主方面和对反动派的专政方面，互相结合起来，就是人民民主专政。”无产阶级就是凭借无产阶级专政这个威
  力无穷的武器，领导广大劳动群众，披荆斩棘，克敌
  制胜，开拓共产主义的新天地。但是，彭真这个反革命修正主义分子，却从老修正主义那里拣来“纯粹民主”、“阶级平等”两件破烂武器，朝着无产阶级专政大肆攻击。
    一九五三年，正当我国人民高举社会主义革命总路线的大旗，向城乡资本主义发起猛烈攻击，进一步巩固和加强无产阶级专政的时候，彭真跟中国赫鲁晓夫学样，步考茨基大反布尔什维克“恐怖主义”之后尘，大叫大嚷要“民主化”。他说什么：“在政治方面，今年要开始实行……民主化”。不分阶级，不讲对敌专政的“民主化”，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级反动口号。民主是阶级的概念。在阶级社会里，有资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级的民主。对资产阶级民主，就是对无产阶级专政。彭真闭口不提哪个阶级的民主，根本不讲对阶级敌人的专政，而侈谈什么抽象的“民主化”，这完全是考茨基“纯粹民主”的翻版，其目的就是要对地主资产阶级讲民主，对无产阶级实行专政。
    一九五四年，反革命修正主义分子彭真，在第一届全国人民代表大会上，利用无产阶级神圣的讲坛，进一步提出了“法律面前人人平等”的口号。这是一个彻头彻尾的资产阶级口号。法律是统治阶级实行专政的工具。只要有法律存在，就根本谈不上什么各阶级的“法律平等”。“法律面前人人平等”，是“阶级平等”的另一种说法。而“阶级平等”则是资产阶级代表人物唱烂了的调子，其目的是为了掩盖剥削者吃人的特权。其实，只要有阶级存在，就根本不可能有什么“阶级平等”。在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级和资产阶级之间，根本不是什么“平等”的关系，而是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的关系，即无产阶级对资产阶级专政、独裁的关系。彭真竟还提出：“共产党才有×××万，地主、富农、资本家有×××万，各有各的意见，不讲出来怎么办？”显然，这就是要资产阶级同无产阶级“平等”，地主、富农同贫、下中农“平等”，阶级敌人同革命人民“平等”。如果社会主义社会各个阶级，真象彭真所鼓吹的那样，都一律平等了，平起平坐了，那末，无产阶级专政岂不变成了“各阶级平等”专政了吗？而这种所谓“各阶级平等”的专政，不是地地道道的由美妙动人的“平等”纱幕装扮起来的资产阶级专政又是什么？
      反革命修正主义分子彭真不仅宣扬资产阶级“民主”、“平等”的谬论，而且正是按照这些谬论干的。他一方面对阶级敌人施仁政，大搞和平土改，竭力包庇反革命分子，拚死扶植资产阶级势力，把一些托派、叛徒、特务、恶霸拉入党内，塞进要害部门。另一方面，他又煽动牛鬼蛇神向无产阶级专政猖狂进攻。反右派斗争之前，他打着“充分发扬民主”的幌子，煽动资产阶级同无产阶级大唱“对台戏”，鼓动资产阶级政党向共产党争“独立”，争“平等”，争“自由”。三年困难时期，他又蛊惑人心地说什么“这几年，党内民主生活存在一些问题，我们有什么就吹什么”，明目张胆地指使牛鬼蛇神反对无产阶级专政。一九六五年，当毛主席领导无产阶级革命派反击资产阶级的猖狂进攻时，他又抛出“在真理面前人人平等”的反动口号，掩护资产阶级继续进攻，阻止无产阶级革命派的回击。反革命修正主义分子彭真，就是这样妄图把无产阶级专政当作所谓“官僚主义”、“阴暗面”彻底“克服”掉。他硬要把资产阶级“死右派”，按照他的所谓“民主”的原则，“选”入无产阶级专政的领导机构，执掌国家帅印。这不是要变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政又是什么？
    借管“生产”、搞“建设”之名，行破坏无产阶级专政之实
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级“专政的第一个作用，就是压迫国家内部的反动阶级、反动派和反抗社会主义革命的剥削者，压迫那些对于社会主义建设的破坏者”。因此，无产阶级专政的首要的任务，就是行使镇压之权。可是，彭真却左一个生产，右一个建设，就是绝口不谈对敌镇压，心怀叵测地把管“生产”、搞“建设”描绘成无产阶级专政国家首要或唯一的任务。一九五○年，我国无产阶级的政权刚刚建立，还没有大张旗鼓地镇压反革命，他就宣扬生产压倒一切的反动谬论，说什么“生产这句话讲得很多了，讲得多了不要紧，应该讲一万次，一万次不够就讲一万零一次，一切要为生产服务”。一九五三年，以三大改造为中心的巩固和加强无产阶级专政的伟大革命群众运动方兴未艾，他又大放厥词，宣称“今后，我们政法工作的主要任务”，就是“保护和促进社会生产力的进一步发展”。一九五七年，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，他变本加厉地宣扬，无产阶级专政国家“今后主要是向自然作斗争，是生产斗争，社会主义建设”。彭真这一套完全撇开无产阶级专政，把管
  “生产”、搞“建设”凌驾于一切之上的邪说，是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义谬论。中国赫鲁晓夫曾经叫嚷：“国家建设工作，是我党在全国的中心工作，（把）党团工作重心转到国家建设上来。……大的运动今后不可能再有了，主要的是集中精力搞经济建设。”苏联现代修正主义集团也胡说什么：“社会主义国家的主要职能”，是“组织经济和文化教育的职能”。彭真的反革命论调，同它们完全是一路货色。
    无产阶级专政的国家是有管生产、搞建设的任务和职能的，但这绝不是首要的，首要的任务和职能只能是对敌行使镇压之权。因为无产阶级专政的国家如果不镇压地主资产阶级的各种破坏，社会主义革命和社会主义建设就根本不可能进行。无产阶级专政的国家如果不对钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物实行专政，这一小撮表面衣冠楚楚，笑容可掬，实为杀人不眨眼的江洋大盗，就会专无产阶级的政，杀我们的头，使江山改色，国家变质，社会主义成果毁于一旦，资本主义卷土重来。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”可是，反革命修正主义分子彭真却反其道而行之，公然把管“生产”、搞“建设”凌驾于政治之上。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫及其死党彭真的主张，无产阶级不搞政治，不搞阶级斗争，不对阶级敌人行使镇压之权，一头埋在经济建设里，沉湎于生产事务之中，只抓粮棉油，不分敌我友，那就会为钻进无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，进行反革命复辟大开方便之门，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。苏修叛徒集团也好，彭真和他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫也好，他们往往借管“生产”、搞“建设”之名，行篡党篡国、复辟资本主义之实。他们的阴谋已经破产，他们的反革命面目已经大白于天下了。
    鼓吹“全民国家”，实行资产阶级专政
    马克思列宁主义认为，国家是阶级斗争的工具，是阶级镇压的机器。可是，彭真为了反对无产阶级专政，却把国家描绘成超阶级的、全民的，用“全民国家”的旗号，实行资产阶级专政。
      他胡说“我们国家是人人都管人，人人都受人管”的机构，是“领导组织公众物质生活和文化生活”的机关，是有如“玻璃板”、“水晶石”那样没有矛盾、没有阶级、没有阶级斗争的世界。一九五八年，他公然宣称，我国的“政权是全民性的”。一九六三年，他为了迅速把无产阶级专政“打破缺口”，在石景山搞“试点”时，又给无产阶级专政国家下了两个“定义”，说我们的国家政权就是“解决首长和（老）百姓问题”的组织，是“管家婆”。
    请看，在这些关于国家的“定义”里，对立的阶级不见了，剩下的只是“人人”、“公众”、“首长和（老）百姓”等等超阶级的人、抽象的人。在这些关于国家的“定义”里，阶级专政也没有了，留下的只是“组织生活”、
  “管家”、“解决问题”之类的超阶级、非政治的玩艺儿。这种不分阶级，不讲无产阶级专政，一视同仁地为各色“人人”和“公众”“组织物质生活和文化生活”、“管家”、“解决问题”的国家，不是地地道道的“全民国家”又是什么？这同资产阶级的所谓国家是“管理众人之事”的机关，是“实现公共福利的工具”的说教，不是一路货色吗？这同资产阶级右派分子罗隆基所谓“国家的目的是求全体国民的共同幸福”的谰言，不是同出一辙吗？这同赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“社会主义国家，不是一个阶级的专政，而是整个社会、全体人民的工具”，不是毫无二致吗？
    国家是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的工具。任何国家都是一定阶级专政的国家。国家和“全民”是绝缘的。“全民国家”过去没有，现在没有，将来也不可能有。正如恩格斯所指出，“说自由的人民国家，就纯粹是无稽之谈了：当无产阶级还需要国家的时候，它之所以需要国家，并不是为了自由，而是为了镇压自己的敌人，一到有可能谈自由的时候，国家本身就不再存在了。”
    资产阶级总是隐瞒自己的阶级地位，正如毛主席所指出，“而用‘国民’的名词达到其一阶级专政的实际”。彭真这个资产阶级代表人物，就是挂着“全民国家”的羊头，卖资产阶级一个阶级专政的狗肉。
    就是在“全民国家”这面破旗下，他招降纳叛，结党营私，把大大小小的牛鬼蛇神，纳入自己的麾下，把旧北京市委搞成一个水泼不进、针插不进的资产阶级独立王国。
    就是在“全民国家”这面破旗下，他把一切牛鬼蛇神和地、富、反、坏、右，一个个“由专政的对象”“转化为民主专政的主人”，让他们为非作歹，反共反人民。
    就是在“全民国家”这面破旗下，他扬言“资本家越大越好”，“听话也是他们听话”，“要让他们有职有权”。他要人们“对地主、富农、反革命分子，要从各方面宽一点”，“对右派要治病救人，与人为善，要一看二帮”。
    就是在“全民国家”这面破旗下，他让各色毒草纷纷出笼，充斥首都书报杂志，舞台银幕。可是对无产阶级革命派的作品，那怕是一根幼苗，他也不放过，统统扼而杀之。
      就是在“全民国家”这面破旗下，他把大叛徒邓拓封为“左派”，把三十年代电影的“祖师爷”夏衍称之为“好人”，竭尽包庇之能事。对于无产阶级革命派，他则动辄加以“反党”罪名，而且动用专政机关，恨不得置之死地而后快。
    如此种种，难道不是完全证明，彭真的所谓“全民国家”，实际上就是赤裸裸的资产阶级专政、法西斯专政吗？
    彭真多年把持的旧北京市委，就是一直在大搞他那资产阶级专政的“全民国家”的。他和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，处心积虑地要把它作为向全国推行资产阶级专政的基地，反革命政变的前哨。长期以来，他们用各种机会，进行篡党篡国的罪恶活动。如果让他们的反革命阴谋得逞，我们国家就要改变颜色，地主资产阶级就要重新骑在人民头上，无产阶级革命成果就要付之东流，千百万人头就要落地。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了他们的阴谋，摧毁了彭真反革命修正主义集团，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫。我们无产阶级革命派必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，把彭真这个无产阶级专政的死敌连同他的后台中国赫鲁晓夫，批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒。让我们无产阶级专政的革命航船，沿着毛主席所指引的航道，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！
