The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Military Training Command of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army jointly held a field conference on resuming classes and making revolution in primary and secondary schools in Beijing on October 24. The conference introduced the experience of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing, which, guided by Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, implemented comprehensive resumption of classes and made revolution throughout the school. Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions in primary and secondary schools present at the conference unanimously expressed their determination to further study and apply Chairman Mao's important instructions given during his inspections of North China, Central South China, and East China, to take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle, and to resume classes and make revolution under the help of the PLA troops executing military training tasks.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Xie Fuzhi, who is also the Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, made an important speech at the meeting. Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing Garrison, Li Zhongqi, and Member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Ding Guoyi, also attended the meeting and delivered speeches.

The representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing emphasized at the meeting that only by resuming classes and making revolution can we further consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, promote the three-in-one combination, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end; only by resuming classes and making revolution can we thoroughly reform the old educational system, teaching principles, and methods, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, and implement Chairman Mao's educational line; only by resuming classes and making revolution can we well accomplish the glorious tasks of "one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao.

The representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing especially emphasized the importance of starting from political and ideological education to do a good job in resuming classes and making revolution. He introduced that, with the help of the PLA troops executing military training tasks, the school organized revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's statements on educational revolution. Teachers and students helped each other in their thoughts. Revolutionary teachers and students deeply felt that resuming classes and making revolution is a serious ideological struggle. They must take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, and fight against selfish thoughts to promote the revolutionization of their thoughts. This is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in resuming classes and making revolution.

The representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing also mentioned that in resuming classes and making revolution, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. In teaching practice, we should teach and reform simultaneously. To reform the past phenomenon of teachers teaching separately from students, teachers should go to the students. Teachers should be with students from preparing lessons, giving lectures, to summarizing teaching situations. Some teachers let students give lectures and provide guidance, which not only mobilized the students' enthusiasm but also cultivated their ability to think independently.

The representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing also emphasized that fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of revolutionary cadres and teachers is the key to doing a good job in resuming classes and making revolution. He said that Chairman Mao taught us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." We have boldly liberated the vast majority of cadres, allowing teachers to return to their classes to engage in activities, and allowing revolutionary cadres to boldly lead the resumption of classes and making revolution and organizational management work, achieving good results. Teachers played a leading role in resuming classes and teaching reform. With the help of the teaching reform investigation team of Beijing Normal University, they proposed teaching reform plans for subjects such as Chinese, mathematics, chemistry, and physics.

The representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing also stressed that in resuming classes and making revolution, we must firmly believe in and rely on the PLA. He said that the PLA troops executing military training tasks are the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words and the most resolute in implementing the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. In resuming classes and making revolution, they studied Chairman Mao's works with revolutionary teachers and students, set an example in criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism. Many PLA comrades participated in the practice of resuming classes and making revolution, participated in the formulation of teaching reform plans, served as political instructors and military physical education teachers, and made contributions to resuming classes and making revolution.

Representatives from the 5th class of Grade 7, the 1st class of Grade 10, and the 3rd class of Grade 7 of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing introduced their specific practices and experiences in resuming classes and making revolution at the meeting.

Many representatives of revolutionary teachers and students from urban and suburban primary and secondary schools who attended the field conference also visited the teaching activities of the 23rd Middle School in Beijing. After the meeting, they immediately returned to their schools to convey and organize discussions on the experience of the 23rd Middle School. Revolutionary teachers and students in various schools unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, to take the 23rd Middle School in Beijing as an example, to immediately resume classes, and to comprehensively resume classes and make revolution.

    北京召开中小学复课闹革命现场会介绍二十三中经验
    从政治思想教育入手搞好复课闹革命
    谢富治同志到会讲话。二十三中革命委员会代表介绍经验时指出：以毛主席教育革命思想为指针，以斗私批修为纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，狠斗私心杂念，促进师生思想革命化，是搞好复课闹革命的根本保证；充分调动革命干部和教师的积极性，是搞好复课闹革命的关键；要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，在教学实践中边教学，边改革；要相信和依靠解放军，象解放军那样，听毛主席的话，坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的指示。
    编者按：北京二十三中革命委员会，在中小学复课闹革命现场会上介绍的经验，读了很受启发。
    复课闹革命，进行教学改革，是一项艰巨的任务。这就需要把各种积极因素充分调动起来，把革命师生、革命干部的积极性发挥出来，把执行军训任务的解放军指战员的作用发挥出来。也就是说，要相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，坚决走群众路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”
    当前，一个很重要的问题，就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，做好深入细致的政治思想工作，使各种人员真正认识到复课闹革命的重要性，认识到自己在完成伟大的教育革命中的重要责任。这样，复课闹革命，才有最可靠的保证。
    新华社二十五日讯　北京市革命委员会和中国人民解放军北京卫戍区军训指挥部，二十四日联合召开了北京市中、小学复课闹革命现场会。会上，由北京二十三中革命委员会代表介绍了他们以毛主席关于教育革命的思想为指针，实行全校全面复课闹革命的经验。到会的中、小学无产阶级革命派共同表示，一定要进一步学好用好毛主席在视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列极为重要的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在执行军训任务的解放军帮助下，立即开学，搞好复课闹革命。
    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理、北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治同志到会作了重要讲话。北京卫戍区副司令员李钟奇、北京市革命委员会常委丁国钰等同志也参加了会议，并先后在会上讲了话。
    北京二十三中革命委员会代表在会上介绍他们复课闹革命经验时强调指出，只有复课闹革命，才能进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；只有复课闹革命，才能彻底改革旧的教育制度、教学方针和方法，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，贯彻执行毛主席的教育路线；只有复课闹革命，才能很好地完成伟大领袖毛主席提出的一斗、二批、三改的光荣任务。
    北京二十三中革命委员会的代表，特别强调从政治思想教育入手，搞好复课闹革命的重要性。他介绍说，他们学校在执行军训任务的解放军帮助下，组织革命师生学习了毛主席有关教育革命的论述，师生之间、学生之间开展了思想互助。革命师生深深体会到，复课闹革命是一场严重的思想斗争，必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，以“老三篇”为座右铭，狠斗私心杂念，促进思想革命化，这是搞好复课闹革命的根本保证。
    北京二十三中革命委员会代表还谈到，在复课闹革命中要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，在教学实践中边教学、边改革。要改革过去教师脱离学生进行教学的现象，就要让教师到学生中去。教师从备课、讲课、到总结教学情况，都要跟学生在一起。有的教师让学生讲课，教师进行辅导，这样既调动了学生的积极性，也培养了他们独立思考的能力。
    北京二十三中革命委员会代表在介绍经验时，还强调指出，充分调动革命干部和革命教师的积极性，是搞好复课闹革命的关键。他说，毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”我们大胆解放了绝大多数干部，让教师都回班级去活动，让革命干部大胆地领导复课闹革命和组织管理工作，收到了很好的效果。教师在复课和教学改革中起到了先行作用，他们在北京师范大学教学改革调查组的帮助下，提出了语文、数学、化学、物理等学科的教学改革方案。
    北京二十三中革命委员会代表还着重指出，在复课闹革命中要坚决相信和依靠解放军。他说，执行军训任务的解放军最听毛主席的话，最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席和党中央的指示，他们在复课闹革命中，和革命师生一起活学活用毛主席著作，在斗私批修中树立了榜样。许多解放军同志参加了复课闹革命的实践，参加了教学改革方案的制定工作，担任了政治课的辅导员和军事体育课的教练员，为复课闹革命做出了贡献。
    北京二十三中初一（五）班、高一（一）班、初一（三）班的代表，分别在会上介绍了他们复课闹革命的具体作法和体会。
    参加现场会的城区和近郊区许多中、小学的革命师生代表，还参观了北京二十三中的教学活动。会后，他们立即回到学校，传达和组织讨论二十三中的经验。各学校的广大革命师生纷纷表示，一定要坚决响应毛主席和党中央的号召，以北京二十三中为榜样，立即开学，全面复课闹革命。
