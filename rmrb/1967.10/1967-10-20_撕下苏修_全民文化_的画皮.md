Title: Tear Off the Mask of the Soviet Revisionists' "Universal Culture"

Not long after the death of Comrade Stalin, the Khrushchev revisionist clique brazenly distorted or openly denied the principle of party leadership in literature proposed by Lenin. They advocated so-called "universal, all-human culture," claiming that "universality is party spirit." At the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, the Khrushchev clique formally inscribed the slogan of "universal, all-human culture" in the party program of the CPSU, along with "universal state" and "universal party," as an important part of their entire counter-revolutionary revisionist program.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A certain culture (as an ideological form of culture) is the reflection of a certain society's politics and economics, and in turn exerts a great influence and effect on a certain society's politics and economics." Chairman Mao also says: "In the present world, all cultures or literatures belong to a certain class and a certain political line."

The so-called "universal, all-human culture" is sheer deception.

In 1959, before Khrushchev's trip to the United States to engage in political deals under the banner of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation," Khrushchev's "close friend" Sholokhov publicly begged the American imperialists in the *Literaturnaya Gazeta*: "Let us come together, we have no reason to argue or fight!" The reactionary poet Yevtushenko, who is even more reactionary, openly wrote a poem expressing his desire to "share destiny" with the United States, declaring that he wanted to "erase the word 'Yankee' from the dictionary forever"! The old rightist writer Ehrenburg, in his long, reactionary memoirs completed just before his death, even went so far as to say that the American ruling class "has made progress," and shouted madly, "If you don't understand America, you can't understand our century!" He even shamelessly boasted that as early as 1950, he had written: "I support peace... and also support peace with Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson!"

This is not "universal, all-human culture"! This is a culture that serves as the executioner of American imperialism in enslaving and oppressing the people of the world, a reactionary culture that advocates U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world!

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, which has betrayed the proletarian revolution and become the world's largest labor traitor, has, over the past decade, through culture and literature, grossly defamed Lenin's image, viciously slandered Stalin, openly denied the path of the October Revolution, and fiercely opposed socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The counter-revolutionary writer Pasternak's *Doctor Zhivago* is a prime example. It viciously curses the October Revolution as a "historical mistake" and an "irreparable disaster," claiming that "everything that happened after the October Revolution—all of it was evil!" For such a reactionary novel, the Soviet revisionist clique treats it as a treasure, and even decided to reprint it many years after the author's death.

In addition, works like Ehrenburg's *The Thaw*, Dudyintsev's *Not by Bread Alone*, Solzhenitsyn's *One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*, Stanyukovich's *Man Is Not an Angel*, and the prose and novels of Ovchinnikov and Akhshonov, as well as the films of Khukhray, Grashimov, and Bondarchuk, and the poetry of Tvardovsky, Yevtushenko, and Mezhlaukis, are either under the guise of opposing "bureaucratism" or under the pretext of eliminating the consequences of "cult of personality," depicting the proletarian dictatorship of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin as a "cold winter" or an "iceberg floating in the vast sea," shouting at the top of their lungs for a "thaw" to summon the spirit of capitalist restoration.

This is not "universal, all-human culture"! This is a barefaced counter-revolutionary culture that slanders the leaders of the proletarian revolution, opposes Marxism-Leninism, and opposes the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Soviet revisionist writers, through their depictions of the anti-fascist war, on the one hand, portray the just revolutionary war as miserable and wretched, exaggerating the cruelty and terror of the revolutionary war, and peddling bourgeois pacifism to intimidate the oppressed people. On the other hand, they openly praise cowards and traitors, advocating the philosophy of survival. Sholokhov, who is hailed by the Soviet revisionist clique as a "great genius of the contemporary world," is a pioneer in this regard. Today, in the Soviet literary world, many works with war themes, under the pretext of mourning the martyrs, openly shout, "Lose your head, what use is principle!" For example, a poet named Roshdestvensky, in a long poem titled *Requiem*, shamelessly asks: "What use is this glory to the dead? What meaning does this glory have for the fallen? They saved all those who survived, but did not save themselves... What use is this glory when people die?"

The great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin, defeated the German fascist invaders with their lives and blood, defended the great achievements of the October Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and inspired the liberation struggle of the oppressed people of the world. However, the Soviet revisionist clique, through literature and art, erased the heroic deeds of the Soviet people in the anti-fascist war, grossly defamed the image of the Soviet Red Army, openly praised cowards and traitors, and vigorously advocated the reactionary idea of "survival is everything." This is a great insult to the Soviet people, the Soviet Red Army, and the revolutionary people of the world!

This is not "universal, all-human culture"! This is the most despicable and shameless culture of traitors!

Everyone knows that Yesenin, Tsvetaeva, Mandelstam, Zhitkov, and Akhmatova, Bunin, and Pasternak, are all representatives of the reactionary decadent bourgeois culture that opposed communism and the people before and after the October Revolution. Because they stubbornly adhered to their reactionary stance of hostility towards the Soviet government, they have long been spit upon by the Soviet people.

After Stalin's death, one of the main criminal activities of the Soviet revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles was to loudly rehabilitate these reactionary elements. They held a nationwide grand memorial for Yesenin, praising him as a "great Russian poet." Akhmatova was treated as a "representative" of Soviet writers, visiting many countries and participating in international conferences. Bunin, Tsvetaeva, Mandelstam, Zhitkov, and Pasternak were also crowned with honors such as "genius" and "outstanding." Their works were compiled into complete works and selected works, published in large quantities, and some were even included in middle school and higher education literature textbooks, becoming "required reading" for today's Soviet youth!

It is under such circumstances that recently, a group of so-called "fourth-generation" writers, who claim to be the "children of the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU," have appeared on the Soviet literary scene. Under the guise of "artistic innovation," they openly declare that the revolutionary hero images created in works such as Gorky's *Mother*, Ostrovsky's *How the Steel Was Tempered*, and Fadeyev's *The Young Guard* are "outdated." In their novels and poems, on the one hand, they viciously attack Marxism-Leninism and slander the dictatorship of the proletariat, and on the other hand, they enthusiastically advocate the decadent and corrupt lifestyle of the Western bourgeoisie. For example, in Grashin's novel, the "positive character" regards "finding ways to accumulate money faster, buying a car, so that every Sunday can go for a drive" as his life goal and the highest ideal of life...

And so on, where is the "universal, all-human culture"! This is a culture that serves to rehabilitate the counter-revolutionary class, a culture that openly advocates the decadent, chaotic, corrupt, and rotten bourgeois culture!

Ironclad facts have torn off the mask of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's so-called "universal, all-human culture," exposing its counter-revolutionary true colors.

As early as 1942, when our country criticized the reactionary bourgeois writers who peddled "superclass literature," Chairman Mao pointed out: "Although they advocate in words that literature is superclass, in reality, they advocate bourgeois literature and oppose proletarian literature." The Soviet revisionist clique's fervent advocacy of "universal, all-human culture" is exactly the same. They outwardly advocate "universal, all-human culture," but in reality, they are promoting a thorough and complete reactionary bourgeois culture.

The so-called "universal culture" of the Soviet revisionist clique, on the one hand, reflects the political stance, class will, class demands, as well as the thoughts, feelings, and lifestyles of the new and old bourgeois elements in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it serves the counter-revolutionary interests of the bourgeois privileged class. Before the Soviet revisionist clique seized the leadership of the party and the state, this reactionary bourgeois culture, under the cover of the tattered "universal culture," confused people's minds and undermined people's revolutionary will, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism in a way that was not easily detectable. After the Soviet revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the party and the state, it became a counter-revolutionary tool for the Soviet bourgeois privileged class to spiritually deceive and enslave the people, maintaining their bourgeois dictatorship.

However, here we can honestly tell Khrushchev's successors, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like, your reactionary slogan of "universal, all-human culture" has been resisted and condemned by the Soviet people and revolutionary cultural workers since it was first proposed; now, the heinous crimes you have committed in the fields of culture and literature under this deceptive reactionary slogan have increasingly aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the Soviet people. The day of your historical retribution will not be long in coming.

　　撕下苏修“全民文化”的画皮
　　樊秀文
    早在斯大林同志逝世后不久，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团就肆意篡改或公开否定列宁提出的文学的党性原则，宣扬所谓“全民的、全人类的文化”，胡说什么“全人类性就是党性”。在苏共第二十二次代表大会上，赫鲁晓夫集团正式把“全民的、全人类的文化”这一口号写在苏共党纲上，和“全民国家”、
  “全民党”一起，作为他们整个反革命修正主义纲领的重要的组成部分。
    毛主席教导我们：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济”。毛主席还说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”
    所谓“全民的、全人类的文化”，纯粹是骗人的鬼话。
    一九五九年，赫鲁晓夫跑到美国大搞“美苏合作”的政治交易前夕，赫鲁晓夫的“挚友”肖洛霍夫在《文学报》上公开向美帝国主义者屈膝哀求：“让我们相互往来吧，我们没有什么可以争论和打仗的理由！”反动透顶的阿飞诗人叶夫图申科竟然在全世界革命人民愤怒声讨美帝在刚果犯下的滔天罪行时，公开写诗表示要和美国“共命运”，声称要把“美国佬”这个字眼从“字典里永远勾掉”！老牌右派作家爱伦堡在临死前写完的又臭又长的六大卷反革命回忆录中，更胡说什么美国统治阶级“已经有了进步”，疯狂叫嚷“不懂得美国，就不能了解我们的世纪”！他甚至还厚颜无耻地自夸，说他早在一九五○年就写过：“我拥护和平，……也拥护同杜鲁门先生和艾奇逊先生的和平”！
    这哪里是什么“全民的、全人类的文化”？！这道道地地是帮助美帝国主义奴役和镇压全世界被压迫人民的刽子手文化，是鼓吹美苏合作主宰世界的反动文化！
    背叛了无产阶级革命，堕落为世界上最大工贼的苏修统治集团，十多年来，通过文化和文学艺术，大肆丑化列宁的形象，恶毒谩骂斯大林，公开否定十月革命的道路，疯狂反对社会主义，反对无产阶级专政。反革命文人帕斯捷尔纳克的《日瓦戈医生》，就是最突出的例证。它恶毒地咒骂十月革命是“历史的错误”和“无法挽救的灾难”，胡说什么十月革命“以后发生的事情——都是罪恶”！对于这一部如此反动的小说，苏修集团竟视为至宝，甚至在作者死了多年以后的今天，还决定予以重新出版。
    此外，象爱伦堡的《解冻》、杜金采夫的《不是单靠面包》、索尔仁尼津的《伊凡·杰尼索维奇的一天》、斯塔纽克的《人不是天使》，奥维奇金和阿克肖诺夫等人的散文小说，丘赫莱依、格拉西莫夫、邦达尔丘克之流的电影，特瓦尔朵夫斯基、叶夫图申科、梅日拉齐斯之流的诗歌等等，都是或以反对“官僚主义”为名，或借口清除“个人迷信”的后果，把列宁、斯大林领导时期的苏联无产阶级专政制度描绘成“阴冷的冬天”或“飘浮在茫茫大海中的冰山”，声嘶力竭地叫喊要“解冻”，为资本主义复辟的“春天”招魂。
    这哪里是什么“全民的、全人类的文化”？！这道道地地是诽谤无产阶级革命领袖，反对马克思列宁主义，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的赤裸裸的反革命文化！
    苏修作家还通过对反法西斯战争的描写，一方面把正义的革命战争描绘得凄凄惨惨，渲染革命战争的残酷恐怖，大肆贩卖资产阶级和平主义，以恫吓被压迫人民，另一方面公开歌颂懦夫叛徒，鼓吹活命哲学。被苏修集团奉为“当代世界的杰出天才”的肖洛霍夫就是这方面的急先锋。今天苏修文坛上出现的大量战争题材的作品中，有的甚至以悼念烈士为名，公开叫喊“丢掉脑袋，原则还有什么用”！例如一个名叫罗什杰斯特文斯基的诗人，在一首题为《安魂曲》的长诗中，竟这样无耻地问道：“对于死去的人，这种光荣有什么用？对于阵亡的人，这种光荣有什么意义？他们拯救了所有活下来的人，唯独没有拯救自己，……死了人，还要这种光荣干什么用？”
    伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党和斯大林的领导下，用生命和鲜血，打败了德国法西斯侵略，保卫了十月革命和无产阶级专政的伟大成果，鼓舞了全世界被压迫人民的解放斗争。而苏修集团却通过文学艺术，一笔勾销了苏联人民在反法西斯战争中的英雄功勋，大肆丑化苏联红军的形象，公开颂扬懦夫叛徒，竭力鼓吹“活命就是一切”的反动思想。这是对苏联人民、苏联红军和全世界革命人民的莫大污辱！
    这哪里是什么“全民的、全人类的文化”？！这道道地地是最卑鄙、最无耻的叛徒文化！
    大家知道，叶赛宁、茨威塔耶娃、孟杰里什坦、左琴柯和阿赫玛托娃、蒲宁和帕斯捷尔纳克等等，都是十月革命前后反共反人民的反动资产阶级颓废文化的代表人物。由于他们顽固坚持敌视苏维埃政权的反动立场，早已被苏联人民所唾弃。
    斯大林逝世后，苏修集团在文艺界所干的主要罪恶活动之一，就是大张旗鼓地为这些反动家伙翻案。他们为叶赛宁举行了全国规模的盛大纪念，吹捧他是“伟大的俄罗斯诗人”。阿赫玛托娃则被作为苏联作家的“代表”，多次出国访问，参加国际会议。蒲宁、茨威塔耶娃、孟杰里什坦、左琴柯和帕斯捷尔纳克之流，也都被戴上“天才”、“杰出”等等的荣誉桂冠。这些人的作品，都被编成全集、选集，大量出版，并且有的竟被列入中学和高等院校的文学教科书，定为今日苏联青年的“必修”读物！
    正是在这种情况下，不久前苏修文坛上出现了一批以“苏共二十大和二十二大的产儿”自命的所谓“第四代”作家。他们打着“艺术革新”的幌子，公开宣布高尔基的《母亲》、奥斯特洛夫斯基的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》和法捷耶夫的《青年近卫军》等作品中所塑造的革命英雄形象“已经过时了”。在他们的小说、诗歌中，一方面恶毒攻击马克思列宁主义、诽谤无产阶级专政，另一方面则狂热地宣扬腐朽、糜烂的西方资产阶级生活方式。例如格拉吉林小说里的“正面人物”竟把“想办法更快地积一笔钱，买一辆小汽车，以便每星期日可以到处去兜风”，当作自己的人生目的和生活的最高理想！……
    如此等等，又哪里是什么“全民的、全人类的文化”？！这道道地地是为反革命阶级翻案的文化，是道道地地宣扬淫荡、混乱、堕落、腐化、臭不可闻的资产阶级颓废文化！
    铁的事实，撕下了苏修统治集团所谓“全民的、全人类的文化”的画皮，暴露了它反革命的真面目。
    早在一九四二年我国批判资产阶级反动文人所贩卖的“超阶级文艺”时，毛主席指出：“他们虽然在口头上提出什么文艺是超阶级的，但是他们在实际上是主张资产阶级的文艺，反对无产阶级的文艺的。”苏修集团狂热地大肆鼓吹“全民的、全人类的文化”，也完全是这样。他们表面上打的是“全民的、全人类的文化”的招牌，实际上搞的是彻头彻尾的反动资产阶级文化。
    苏修集团所谓的“全民文化”，一方面是苏联新旧资产阶级分子的政治立场、阶级意志、阶级要求以及他们的思想感情、生活方式的反映，同时，反过来又是为资产阶级特权阶层的反革命利益服务的。在苏修领导集团上台以前，这种反动的资产阶级文化，在“全民文化”这块破烂不堪的遮羞布的掩饰下以一种令人不易察觉的方式搞乱人们的思想，瓦解人们的革命意志，为复辟资本主义制造舆论准备；在苏修集团篡夺党和国家的领导之后，它又成了苏联资产阶级特权阶层从精神上欺骗、奴役人民，以维护他们资产阶级专政的反革命工具。
    不过，在这里，我们可以老实告诉赫鲁晓夫的继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，你们这个“全民的、全人类的文化”的反动口号，在刚提出时就曾经遭到过苏联人民和革命文化工作者的抵制和谴责；现在，你们用这个骗人的反动口号在文化和文学艺术领域里所犯下的滔天罪行，已经愈来愈激起广大苏联人民的愤懑。你们受历史的严惩的日子不会太长久了。
