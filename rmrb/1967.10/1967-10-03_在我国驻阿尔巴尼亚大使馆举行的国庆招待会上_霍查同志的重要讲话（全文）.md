New China News Agency, Tirana, October 1st: Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the close friend of the Chinese people, delivered an important speech on September 29th at the reception held by the Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Albania, Li Tingquan, to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The full text is as follows:

Dear Comrade Li Tingquan,
Dear Comrade Wang Shusheng,
Comrades and Friends,

We are very pleased to gather here tonight to celebrate the glorious anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Presidium of the People's Assembly and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, our most sincere congratulations and respect to the fraternal Chinese people, the heroic Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and to the great leader of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong.

Comrade Li Tingquan, we believe that the warm words you have spoken to our people and our party are a manifestation of the friendship and iron-clad unity that bind our two peoples and our two parties together. The Albanian people and the Party of Labour of Albania hold deep internationalist sentiments and sincere affection for their loyal friends and allies, the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and their beloved leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

We, the people and the party of our country, believe that October 1st is not only a day cherished by the fraternal Chinese people but also by the Albanian people and all revolutionary people who love freedom around the world. Therefore, it is a day of great joy for all of us.

Under the leadership of the seasoned Communist Party of China, headed by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people, armed with weapons, have bravely and steadfastly overcome unprecedented difficulties and obstacles in their long revolutionary struggle against foreign imperialist invaders and domestic traitors, liberating their glorious homeland and finally achieving victory in the people's revolution, proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic of China.

October 1st is a momentous event of great historical significance, marking a turning point that determines China's future and opening up broad prospects for the victory of the socialist revolution on a global scale. The victory of the Chinese socialist revolution has fundamentally shattered the imperialist front, altering the balance of power in the world in favor of socialism. For the peoples of various countries who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism for national and social liberation, it is a great source of revolutionary inspiration and mobilization.

In the past eighteen years of struggle and creative work, great strides have been made. Today, she has become a powerful socialist state with modern industry, collectivized agriculture, advanced proletarian culture and science, and modern defensive forces that make the American imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries tremble with fear. Today, the People's Republic of China enjoys the great international prestige it deserves. She is praised and respected as a great center of the socialist revolution, a staunch supporter of the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of all countries who love freedom, and a red banner of Marxism-Leninism.

This year, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being successfully carried out and achieving brilliant victories. In various parts of China, hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the Red Guards, have risen up with all their might to overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, who are attempting to subvert the Party from within, sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, and restore capitalism. The fierce class struggle currently underway in China shows the deep hatred of the revolutionary masses towards the enemies of Marxism-Leninism. It is a life-and-death struggle between the socialist line and the capitalist line, between revolution and counter-revolution, between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism.

The revisionists in China have been exposed, thoroughly criticized, and isolated. Their positions have been fundamentally smashed, and their counter-revolutionary lines have been crushed and annihilated from all sides. The revolutionary masses, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist teachings, are seizing power and firmly holding it in their own hands, implementing revolutionary great unity. The conspiracies and fantasies of the imperialists and modern revisionists to repeat the tragedy of the Soviet Union in China have been smashed. For this reason, they are attacking and slandering fraternal China, attacking and slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and attacking and slandering Comrade Mao Zedong himself, just like wounded beasts. They see in the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in China's victorious advance the failure of all their conspiracies against China and against socialism. They tremble in fear at the sight of their own doom. Let the enemy tremble. What awaits them is only miserable failure. Great People's China will forever remain red, forever the center of the socialist revolution and the invincible Marxism-Leninism. Marxist-Leninists, steadfast revolutionaries, and progressive people of all countries are jubilant and united around the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops, the great Chinese people will continue to achieve new victories.

Guided by the Marxist-Leninist teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, the broad masses of Chinese workers have taken control of the fate of the Chinese revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They enthusiastically support the battle cry of "Revolutionize and promote production." The great achievements made by China on all fronts of production, the orderliness and discipline of work, the optimism and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, reflect the correctness and power of the line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. On this basis, a new generation of revolutionaries who are worthy successors of the cause of socialism and revolution is growing and being tempered.

Our party has pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is of great significance not only for China but also for all revolutionary forces and the international communist and workers' movement. It is particularly instructive for Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary laborers in countries where revisionists are in power, showing them how to rise up and overthrow and annihilate the revisionist traitors who have usurped power and are restoring capitalism.

The people of Albania, our party, and our government enthusiastically applaud and strongly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. We regard it as the greatest victory of the fraternal Chinese people since the victory of the armed revolution that led to the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st, 1949, as our victory and the victory of all revolutionary peoples of the world, as a brilliant victory for Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, we sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater achievements on the bright road of socialism and communism, and we wish Comrade Mao Zedong eternal life, as long as our mountains.

Dear Comrades,

For the forces of the socialist revolution and Marxism-Leninism, and for the peoples of various countries who are rising up to fight for national liberation, we are celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in a situation where the international situation is excellent.

In various parts of the world, the initiative is in the hands of the forces and peoples who are rising up in revolution. Great socialist China, like a giant, is at the forefront, and has become their reliable pillar. The attempts of the imperialists and colonialists, led by the United States, to reverse this irresistible historical process have failed. In this situation, the executioners of the freedom and progress of the peoples of various countries, the American imperialists, in order to save their doomed system and restore their hegemony in the world, are using all means to prepare for a third world war. In this extremely evil conspiracy, the Soviet revisionist traitors have become their most reliable allies, and are closely collaborating with them against socialism, communism, and the national liberation movements of the peoples of various countries. They are conspiring together to invade the People's Republic of China, because the People's Republic of China is the main and insurmountable obstacle to their evil deeds; they are colluding to combine savage bombing and political pressure to extinguish the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, forcing the Vietnamese people to surrender, to the benefit of the American imperialist invaders; they are conspiring to suppress the just struggle of liberation of the fraternal Arab peoples against the American imperialist lackey, the Israeli invaders; now, through various open and secret agreements, they are trying to divide spheres of influence and dominate the world.

But all these evil conspiracies have already failed in the face of the vigilance, unity, and resolute struggle of the peoples of the world. The peoples of the world have recognized that the American imperialists are their main enemy, and that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a dangerous and malicious enemy, and must be fought against just as resolutely and mercilessly.

Our two parties and our two countries, all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces, the world proletariat and revolutionary peoples, are achieving continuous victories in their resolute struggle against our common enemies, the imperialists and revisionists. The heroic struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people is a brilliant example of the power and superiority of people's revolutionary wars. Our party, our government, and our people will always fully support this struggle until the final victory over the American imperialist invaders, which is undoubted and inevitable. We applaud the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which once again expresses the glorious Vietnamese people's determination to carry on their just and heroic struggle to the end, without fear of sacrifice.

The power of the people is greater than the power of imperialism. They will definitely win. The revolution is advancing. Marxism-Leninism will inevitably triumph over revisionism. Human history has entered an era where the socialist revolution will triumph worldwide, and the bloody oppressive system of capitalism will collapse.

The traitors of Moscow actually have the audacity to invite our party to participate in the "celebration" they are organizing in Moscow for the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. Our party has contemptuously rejected the filthy invitation of the Soviet revisionists. We will celebrate the great October Revolution in our homeland with joyful hearts.

We, the communists and people of Albania, will, as always, sing with gratitude the praises of the October Revolution, of Lenin, Stalin, of the Bolsheviks, and of the heroic fraternal Soviet people with whom we have maintained close ties in the past and present. Together with the Soviet people, we will, through severe and unyielding struggle, smash the heads of the Soviet revisionist traitors and bury them.

The so-called "celebration" in Moscow is a pathetic farce that the revisionists are using to deceive and cover up their betrayal. Behind the facade of the "celebration" of the 50th anniversary, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is plotting new conspiracies against China, against Albania, against the Party of Labour of Albania, against the Communist Party of China, and against the world communist movement.

For years, the Soviet revisionists have been trying to organize a conference of all the revisionist parties of the world with their traitorous partners. They will do the same on the day of the October Revolution. Whether they succeed or not, we do not care. Whether they succeed or not, for us Marxist-Leninists, it is a victory, because both outcomes will only confirm what we have said on many other occasions, which means the split of the revisionists and the worsening of their situation at home.

This result is dialectical. The revisionist cliques that have usurped party and state power cannot unite because they are classless bourgeois cliques, representatives of new aristocrats who are trying to impose full oppression on the working class, closely collaborating with imperialists and various capitalists. Therefore, their contradictions are deepening day by day, and their unity is baseless, unprincipled, and will only be quickly exposed and destroyed. Their common international revisionist program is a source of confusion and chaos. The root of this confusion and chaos lies in the chaos within each revisionist clique at home and within the party. Modern revisionists can only be playthings of the bourgeoisie, only servile lackeys of the bourgeoisie. Modern revisionists try to appear as if they are one with the masses and the grassroots of their party. This is a deception. Such a situation does not exist because the masses will never support their leaders who betray Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian cause. The masses and the majority of ordinary party members will eventually rise up against them because they know from personal experience that only the dictatorship of the proletariat can guarantee true democracy, protect the working class and other laboring people from capitalist exploitation and imperialist wars, and ensure the victory of socialism and communism at home and internationally. Therefore, the downfall of the revisionist parties is inevitable. New Marxist-Leninist parties have been and will be established and tempered. This is an objective law.

At this time, when the great struggle between revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces is taking place in the world, the Albanian people and their Party of Labour stand proudly with the seven hundred million Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party. Under the leadership of the Party of Labour, the People's Republic of Albania has always adhered to and will forever adhere to the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism, has withstood and will forever bravely withstand all storms, and has withstood and will forever bravely withstand the conspiracies and fierce attacks of American imperialism and its lackeys, as well as the conspiracies of the Khruchevite and Titoite revisionists. China and Albania are forever united. They bravely fight together against imperialism and revisionism, defend Marxism-Leninism, and strive for the victory of Marxism-Leninism. In the future, they will also fight side by side and achieve new victories together, contributing to the great cause of communism that unites us and all proletarians and revolutionary peoples.

At this moment of celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the fraternal People's Republic of China, the great friendship and iron-clad internationalist unity between our two peoples and countries are stronger than ever. The visit of the Albanian party and state delegation led by Comrade Shehu to the People's Republic of China will write a new chapter in the history of Albanian-Chinese friendship and brotherly cooperation, embodying the complete unity of thought and action between our two parties and countries. The Albanian people, who are enthusiastically implementing the great program of the Fifth Party Congress to further revolutionize national life, sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater and more glorious victories in this joyous festival.

Please allow me to propose a toast:

To the everlasting and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Albania and China,
To the great heroic Chinese people,
To the glorious Communist Party of China and its outstanding leader, the beloved friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong,
To the Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Lin Biao,
To the Government of the People's Republic of China and its Premier, Comrade Zhou Enlai,
To Comrade Li Tingquan, Comrade Wang Shusheng, and all the Chinese guests present,
To the victory of Marxism-Leninism,
Cheers!

    在我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆举行的国庆招待会上
    霍查同志的重要讲话（全文）
    新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密朋友霍查同志，九月二十九日在中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃举行的庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的招待会上发表了重要讲话，全文如下：亲爱的李庭荃同志，亲爱的王树声同志，同志们，朋友们，
    我们今天晚上在这里共聚一堂，欢庆十月一日中华人民共和国成立的光荣节日，我们感到非常高兴。请允许我借此机会，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民，劳动党中央委员会，人民议会主席团和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，向兄弟的中国人民，英雄的中国共产党，中华人民共和国政府，向中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民亲密的朋友毛泽东同志，致以最热烈的敬意和祝贺。
    李庭荃同志，我们认为，你对我国人民和我们党说的热情的话，是把我们两国人民和两党连结在一起的友谊和钢铁的团结的体现。阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，对他们的忠实朋友和盟友，对伟大的中国人民，对光荣的中国共产党及其敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志，怀着深厚的国际主义情谊和真挚的热爱。
    我国人民和我们党认为，十月一日这一节日，不仅是兄弟的中国人民所珍爱的，也是阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界所有爱好自由的革命人民所珍爱的。因此，这是我们大家都十分欢乐的节日。
    兄弟的中国人民，在以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，手拿武器，经过抗击外国帝国主义侵略者和本国卖国贼的长期革命斗争，英勇和坚定地克服了罕见的困难险阻，解放了自己的光荣的祖国，终于取得了人民革命的胜利，宣告了中华人民共和国的成立。
    十月一日，是具有巨大历史意义的大事，标志着决定中国的未来的一个转折点，为世界范围的社会主义革命的胜利打开了广阔的前景。中国社会主义革命的胜利，从根本上粉碎了帝国主义阵线，改变了世界的力量对比而有利于社会主义，对于为抗击帝国主义和殖民主义，为争取民族和社会解放而斗争的各国人民来说，是革命的鼓舞和动员的巨大的泉源。
    伟大的人民中国在过去十八年的斗争和创造性的工作中，迈出了巨大的步伐。今天，她已经成为一个拥有现代化工业、社会主义集体化农业、先进的无产阶级文化和科学以及使美帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派怕得要死的现代化防御力量的强大的社会主义国家。今天，中华人民共和国享有应得的巨大国际威望，她作为社会主义革命的伟大中心，作为爱好自由的各国人民反帝斗争的坚决支持者，作为马克思列宁主义的红彤彤的旗手，受到赞扬和尊敬。
    今年，是在毛泽东主席亲自领导下的无产阶级文化大革命正在各地顺利开展、取得辉煌胜利的气氛中，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。在中国各地，亿万工农兵群众和红卫兵已经全力奋起打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，这一小撮人企图从内部攻破堡垒、破坏中国共产党，推翻中国的无产阶级专政和复辟资本主义。目前在中国激烈地开展的阶级斗争，表明了革命群众对马克思列宁主义的死敌的深仇大恨，这是一场社会主义路线和资本主义路线、革命和反革命、马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间的生死搏斗。
    中国的修正主义分子已经被揪出来，被充分揭露和孤立。他们的阵地已经从根本上被粉碎，他们的反革命阵线已经从四面八方被打垮和消灭。无产阶级革命派，按照毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的教导，正在把权力夺过来，可靠地掌握在自己手中，实行革命大联合。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者企图使苏联的悲剧在中国重演的种种阴谋和妄想已经被粉碎。正是因为这个缘故，他们象受了致命伤的野兽一样疯狂攻击和诬蔑兄弟的中国、攻击和诬蔑无产阶级文化革命以及毛泽东同志本人。他们在无产阶级文化革命的胜利中，在中国的胜利前进中，看到他们反对中国、反对社会主义的一切阴谋的失
  败。他们胆战心惊地看到了他们自己的末日。让敌人
  去发抖吧。等待着他们的只是悲惨的失败，伟大的人
  民中国将永远保持红色，永远是社会主义革命和战无
  不胜的马克思列宁主义的中心。世界各国的马克思列
  宁主义者，坚定不移的革命者和进步人民欢欣鼓舞，
  团结在中华人民共和国和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的周围。随着无产阶级文化大革命的开展，伟大的中国人民今后也将不断取得新的胜利。
    遵循毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的教导，中国的广大劳动群众掌握了中国革命和无产阶级专政的命运。他们热烈拥护“抓革命，促生产”的战斗口号。中国在各条生产战线上取得的巨大成就，工作的有秩序和有纪律，群众的乐观主义和革命热情，反映了无产阶级文化革命的正确路线以及毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的正确和威力；在这种思想的基础上，不愧为社会主义和革命事业的接班人的革命的新的一代正在成长和经受锻炼。
    我们党已经指出，无产阶级文化大革命不仅对于中国，而且对于全世界一切革命派以及国际共产主义和工人运动都具有十分重大的意义。特别是对于修正主义者当权的那些国家的马克思列宁主义者和革命的劳动群众有很大的教益，向他们指明如何起来推翻和消灭篡夺权力和复辟资本主义的修正主义叛徒。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，我们党和政府，欢呼和热烈支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命。我们把它看作是兄弟的中国人民继导致一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立的武装革命胜利之后的最伟大的胜利，看作是我们的胜利和全世界一切革命人民的胜利，看作是马克思列宁主义的辉煌胜利。因此，我们衷心祝愿兄弟的中国人民在社会主义和共产主义的光辉道路上取得更大的成就，祝愿毛泽东同志万寿无疆，象我们的高山一样长寿。
    亲爱的同志们，
    对社会主义革命和马克思列宁主义力量来说，对奋起进行民族解放斗争的各国人民来说，我们是在国际形势一片大好的情况下庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的。
    在世界各地，主动权掌握在起来闹革命的力量和人民手中。伟大的社会主义中国，象巨人一样走在最前列，已成为他们的可靠支柱。以美国为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者想扭转这一不可抗拒的历史进程的一切企图已经失败。在这种情况下，扼杀各国人民的自由和进步的刽子手美帝国主义者，为了挽救他们的濒于灭亡的制度和恢复他们在世界上的霸权，用一切办法准备挑起第三次世界大战。在这一罪大恶极的阴谋中，苏联修正主义叛徒已经成了他们的最得心应手的同盟军，并且同他们紧密勾结在一起反对社会主义、共产主义和各国人民的民族解放运动。他们合伙策划侵略中华人民共和国的阴谋，因为中华人民共和国是他们的罪恶勾当的主要的
  和不可逾越的障碍；他们狼狈为奸，把野蛮轰炸和政
  治压力结合起来，企图扑灭越南人民的英勇斗争，迫
  使越南人民投降，以利于美帝国主义侵略者；他们合谋设法镇压兄弟的阿拉伯人民抗击美帝国主义的马前卒以色列侵略者的正义解放斗争；现在又通过种种公开和秘密的协议，企图在他们之间划分势力范围和主宰世界。
    但是，所有这些险恶的阴谋，在世界各国人民的警惕、团结和坚决斗争面前，已经肯定失败了，世界各国人民认清美帝国主义者是他们的主要敌人，认清苏修领导集团是危险和恶毒的敌人，必须同样坚决地与之进行无情的斗争。
    我们两党和两国，所有的马克思列宁主义政党和力量，世界无产阶级和革命人民，对我们的共同敌人帝国主义者和修正主义者所进行的坚决斗争，正在不断取得胜利。兄弟的英雄越南人民的英勇斗争，是人民革命战争的威力和优越性的光辉范例。我们党、我国政府和人民将始终全力支持这一斗争，直到取得对美帝国主义侵略者的最后胜利为止，这个最后胜利是毫无疑义的，是必然的。我们欢呼越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领，这个政治纲领再一次表达了光荣的越南人民不怕牺牲，要把他们的正义和英勇斗争进行到底，直到胜利的坚定决心。
    人民的力量比帝国主义力量强大。他们一定会胜利。革命在前进。马克思列宁主义必然地要战胜修正主义。人类历史已经进入了社会主义革命在世界范围内胜利、资本主义的血腥压迫的奴役制度崩溃的时代。
    莫斯科的叛徒们居然有脸邀请我们党去参加他们将在莫斯科为伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年组织的“庆祝大典”。我们党轻蔑地拒绝了苏联修正主义者的肮脏邀请。我们将在我们的祖国以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝伟大的十月革命。
    我们阿尔巴尼亚的共产党人和人民将一如既往地怀着感激的心情歌颂十月革命，歌颂列宁、斯大林，歌颂布尔什维克们以及我们过去和现在都保持紧密联系的英雄的兄弟的苏联人民，我们和苏联人民一起将通过严峻和不屈不挠的斗争砸烂苏修叛徒之流的脑袋，并且把他们埋葬。
    莫斯科的所谓庆祝大典是修正主义者用来欺骗和掩饰他们的背叛的一出可悲的滑稽剧。在五十周年的“庆祝大典”的幌子后面，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团企图策划反对中国、反对阿尔巴尼亚、反对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、反对中国共产党、反对世界共产主义运动的新阴谋。
    苏联修正主义者几年来一直要他们的叛徒伙伴们一起来组织一次全世界修正主义党的会议。在十月革命节的时候，他们也会这样做。他们能不能达到目的，我们毫不在乎。达到目的也好，达不到目的也好，对我们马克思列宁主义者来说，都是一个胜利，因为两者都只能证实我们在别的许多场合所说的话，这意味着修正主义者的分裂和他们在国内的处境的恶化。
      这种结果是合乎辩证法的。那些篡夺了党政大权的修正主义集团不可能团结，因为它们是毫无原则的资产阶级集团，他们是企图对工人阶级实行全面的压迫，同帝国主义者和形形色色的资本家紧密勾结的新贵族的代表。因此，它们之间的矛盾日益加深，而它们之间的一致则是没有基础、不讲原则的、除了很快地被揭露和被破坏以外，不会有别的结果。它们的共同的、国际修正主义纲领的毫无办法的一片混乱的根源，在于每一个修正主义集团国内和党内的混乱。现代修正主义者只能是资产阶级手中的玩物，只能是资产阶级的驯服的卖力的奴才。现代修正主义者企图装出一副和群众、和他们的党的基层打成一片的样子。这是一种欺骗。这种情况是不存在的，因为群众决不会支持他们的背叛马克思列宁主义和无产阶级事业的领导人。群众和大多数的普通党员迟早会起来反对他们，因为他们从切身经验知道：只有无产阶级专政才能保证真正的民主，保护工人阶级和其他劳动人民免受资本主义剥削和帝国主义战争，保证社会主义和共产主义在本国和国际范围的胜利。因此，各修正主义政党的覆灭是不可避免的。新的马克思列宁主义政党已经建立和将要建立，并且将要受到锻炼。这是一个客观规律。
    在今天世界上革命力量和反革命力量正在进行的巨大搏斗的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的劳动党站在七亿中国人民和他们的光荣的共产党一边，他们为此感到自豪。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在劳动党的领导下，一向坚持并将永远坚持马克思列宁主义的不朽原则，顶住了并且将永远英勇地顶住一切风暴，顶住美帝国主义及其走狗以及赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义分子的阴谋和猛烈攻击。中国和阿尔巴尼亚是永远连结在一起的。他们一起来英勇反对帝国主义和修正主义，保卫马克思列宁主义和争取马克思列宁主义的胜利，今后他们也将并肩战斗，一起取得新的胜利，一起对把我们和把所有的无产者和革命人民团结在一起的伟大的共产主义事业作出贡献。
    在兄弟的中华人民共和国建国十八周年庆典的时刻，我们两国人民和两国之间的伟大友谊和钢铁般的国际主义团结，比任何时候都更加坚强。由谢胡同志率领的我国党政代表团这次对中华人民共和国的访问，将在阿中友好关系和兄弟合作的历史上写下新的一页，是我们两党两国思想完全一致、行动完全一致的又一体现。正在以巨大的革命热情着手把党的第五次代表大会关于使国家生活进一步革命化的雄伟纲领变为现实的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在兄弟的中国人民的这一欢乐节日中，衷心祝愿他们取得更加辉煌、更加伟大的胜利。
    请允许我提议
    为阿中两国人民的牢不可破的永恒友谊，
    为伟大的英雄中国人民，
    为光荣的中国共产党及其杰出的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的朋友毛泽东同志的健康，
    为中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志的健康，
    为中华人民共和国政府及其总理周恩来同志的健康，
    为李庭荃同志、王树声同志和全体在座的中国客人的健康，
    为马克思列宁主义的胜利，
    干杯！（附图片）
