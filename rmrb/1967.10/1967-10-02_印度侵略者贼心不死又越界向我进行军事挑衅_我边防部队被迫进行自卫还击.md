	New Delhi, October 1st—According to a report from our Tibet border defense forces: At 11:45 AM today, eight Indian soldiers crossed the Sino-Indian border at the Zola Pass and entered Chinese territory, provoking our border patrol personnel. Subsequently, more than fifty Indian aggressors, under the cover of heavy artillery fire, launched an attack on our border defense forces, killing and injuring our border soldiers. Our border defense forces were compelled to counterattack in self-defense. As of the time of this report, the battle is still ongoing, and our border defense forces are closely monitoring the situation.

	The reactionary government of India, since September 7th, has repeatedly launched military provocations against us. On September 11th, they launched a armed attack, which was met with a resolute and powerful counterattack by our border defense forces. After that, on September 14th, they were forced to temporarily cease fire. However, they are not willing to accept defeat and have once again launched military provocations against us today. We sternly warn the reactionary government of India: you will not achieve anything by resorting to military provocations to curry favor with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

    印度侵略者贼心不死又越界向我进行军事挑衅
    我边防部队被迫进行自卫还击
    新华社拉萨一日十五时电　据我西藏边防部队报告：今天上午十一时四十五分，印军八人越过中锡边界卓拉山口，进入中国境内，向我边防执勤人员进行挑衅，尔后，印度侵略军五十余人，又在猛烈的炮火掩护下，向我边防部队发起攻击，打死打伤我边防战士，我边防部队被迫进行自卫还击。截至发电时止，战斗仍在继续，我边防部队正密切注视中。印度反动政府，自九月七日以来，连续多次向我发起军事挑衅，九月十一日向我发动武装进攻，遭我边防部队坚决有力的自卫还击之后，九月十四日被迫暂时停火。但它并不甘心于失败，今天再次对我进行军事挑衅。我们严重警告印度反动政府，你们想靠军事挑衅来讨好美帝、苏修，决不会有好下场。
