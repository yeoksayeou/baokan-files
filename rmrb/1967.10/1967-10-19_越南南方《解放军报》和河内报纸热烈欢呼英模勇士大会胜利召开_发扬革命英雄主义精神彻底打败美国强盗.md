	Vietnamese Southern Liberation Army Newspaper and Hanoi Newspapers Warmly Celebrate the Successful Opening of the Model and Heroic Soldiers Conference

	Carry Forward the Revolutionary Heroism Spirit and Thoroughly Defeat the American Aggressors

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 18th — The Vietnamese Southern Liberation Army Newspaper recently published an editorial, warmly celebrating the opening of the second conference of model and heroic soldiers of the Vietnamese Southern People's Liberation Armed Forces.

	The editorial said, this conference is a historic milestone in our 14 million people's extremely heroic struggle against more than 1 million American, puppet, and mercenary troops.

	The editorial said, our army is a great collective of heroes who have created miracles in the anti-American national salvation war. Our heroes are all born out of heroic collectives, so the glory of the heroes is also the glory of each one of us. The more we love our heroes, the more we must strive to learn from their examples.

	The editorial said, facing the American aggressors' frenzied plots and actions to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnamese South, our struggle is entering a particularly tense and fierce new stage. However, this is also a favorable opportunity for our military and civilians to defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, and to achieve great victories for the motherland. The editorial said, with our invincible revolutionary heroism, we have already and are achieving victories. We will certainly achieve complete victory.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 18th — Hanoi newspapers recently published editorials, warmly celebrating the successful holding of the second conference of model and heroic soldiers of the Vietnamese Southern People's Liberation Armed Forces. The editorial of the People's Daily pointed out that this conference marks a new and very important achievement in the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese Southern military and civilians. The editorial said, the first conference of model representatives held in 1965 was characterized by a comprehensive victory over the American "special war." The recently held second conference of model and heroic soldiers is an epic celebrating the great victory of the 14 million people of Vietnamese South. Under the coordination of the entire nation's military and civilians, the Vietnamese Southern people have defeated the enemy in the first stage of the "limited war" launched by the Americans. The editorial reaffirmed the Vietnamese people's determination to fight for independence and freedom at any cost. The editorial said, this conference will have a great inspiring effect on the Vietnamese national military and civilians in the anti-American national salvation struggle.

	The editorial of the People's Army Daily pointed out that the second conference of model and heroic soldiers of the Vietnamese Southern People's Liberation Armed Forces is a rich summary of the significant strategic victories achieved by the Vietnamese Southern military and civilians in the military and political fields during the important period of the U.S. imperialists' "limited war" strategy. This conference is a vivid embodiment of the rapid growth and strengthening of the heroic Vietnamese Southern military and civilians. This conference is a vivid picture of the creative ability and wisdom of people who dare to fight, are determined to fight, and have ways to defeat the American invaders.

	The editorial said, the people of Vietnamese South use the extremely vivid and rich combat methods of people's war to defeat the enemy. The editorial said, the American aggressors have fallen into a predicament, but they are still frantically strengthening the war of aggression against Vietnam. No matter how fierce and brutal the war will be, the military and civilians of Vietnamese North and South will resolutely implement the teachings of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, unite as one, fear no hardships and sacrifices, and decisively defeat the American aggressors.
