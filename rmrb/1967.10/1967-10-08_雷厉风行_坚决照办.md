Swift and Resolute Action

“Criticize and repudiate revisionism, and overcome selfishness” is the latest battle call issued by our great leader Chairman Mao to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the nation. We must act swiftly and resolutely, and carry it out to the letter.

Acting swiftly means to move at the first sign of wind, to act immediately upon a command, ensuring that the highest directives are implemented without delay.

Acting swiftly means to do exactly as Chairman Mao says, following every word and every sentence to the letter. We must make the greatest resolve, overcome all obstacles, and conquer all difficulties to ensure complete implementation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the “Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,” which clearly states: “Although the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, they are attempting to corrupt the masses and conquer their hearts with the old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, striving to achieve their goal of restoration. The proletariat, on the contrary, must resolutely counter all challenges from the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, using the new ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat to change the spiritual face of the entire society.” The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China’s Khrushchev at the helm, are the most stubborn defenders and representatives of the bourgeoisie’s ideological system. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have exposed them and pulled them down from their horses, seizing their power organizationally. This is still not enough to achieve our ultimate revolutionary goal. Only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, by overthrowing and annihilating them, and by using the new ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat—namely, the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong—to change the spiritual face of the entire society and to transform people’s souls, to thoroughly transform non-proletarian worldviews, and to achieve the ideological revolution, can we truly achieve our ultimate revolutionary goal.

### 雷厉风行  坚决照办

    雷厉风行  坚决照办
    “斗私，批修”，是我们伟大领袖毛主席向全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众发出的最新战斗号令。我们必须雷厉风行，坚决照办。
    雷厉风行，就是要闻风而动，一声令下，立即行动，做到贯彻最高指示不过夜。
    雷厉风行，就是毛主席怎么说的就怎么做，句句照办，字字照办。要下定最大的决心，排除一切阻扰，战胜一切困难，保证全部实现。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》中明确指出：“资产阶级虽然已经被推翻，但是，他们企图用剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，来腐蚀群众，征服人心，力求达到他们复辟的目的。无产阶级恰恰相反，必须迎头痛击资产阶级在意识形态领域里的一切挑战，用无产阶级自己的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯，来改变整个社会的精神面貌。”以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是资产阶级思想体系最顽固的维护者和代表者。我们无产阶级革命派把他们揪出来拉下马，从组织上夺了他们的权，这还不能算是达到了最终的革命目的，只有把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭，用无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，也就是用光焰无际的毛泽东思想，来改变整个社会的精神面貌，来改造人们的灵魂，彻底改造非无产阶级的世界观，实现思想革命化，才是我们彻底革命的根本目的。（《青海日报》十月五日社论）
