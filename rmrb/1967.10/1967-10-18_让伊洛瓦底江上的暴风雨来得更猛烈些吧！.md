Let the storm on the Irrawaddy River become more violent!

The Irrawaddy River is roaring, and the Shan Plateau is thundering. Dark Myanmar, in the lightning of the storm, has red flags fluttering. The Communist Party of Burma is leading the Burmese people to launch a great storm of armed struggle.

The fertile Irrawaddy Delta is a world-renowned rice granary. Rice is the mainstay of Burma's economy. The total agricultural output value, with rice as the main component, accounts for about seventy percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Rice exports account for eighty-five to ninety-five percent of its total foreign exchange earnings. Since this century, Burma has been a famous rice-exporting country.

The Irrawaddy River flows day and night, as it always has; but the fascist shadow of the Ne Win reactionary clique hangs over Burma's sky. Prosperous Burma has fallen into the abyss of hunger and darkness. The world-famous rice granary has plummeted to become a land of famine. The reactionary government's newspapers openly call for people to tighten their belts, "eat one meal a day," and "prepare to go hungry." Many rural areas have even resorted to eating grass roots and tree bark. Living in the rice granary with empty stomachs, the world's largest rice exporter has no food to eat. This is a miniature of Ne Win's so-called "socialism," and also the fate of his tyranny.

This bloodthirsty, extremely reactionary Ne Win clique, in order to deceive and swindle, desperately waves the banner of "socialism." They call their plan of dictatorship, brutality, anti-communism, and anti-people "Socialist Program"; they call their fascist dictatorship tool, with reactionary officers as the backbone, representing the interests of Burmese feudal landlords and bureaucratic capitalists, the "Socialist Program Party."

When someone makes a fool of themselves, there are always people to cheer them on. The Ne Win clique in Burma falsely claims that their country is "on the road to socialism in Burma," and the Soviet revisionist clique says that "Burma's road to socialism denies the capitalist road." The Ne Win clique boasts of its achievements, and the Soviet revisionist clique follows suit, flatteringly praising that the five years since Ne Win came to power are Burma's "leapfrog years."

What a "road to socialism"! What a "leapfrog year"! Indeed, in the five years since Ne Win took the "road to socialism," Burma's "leapfrog" has been remarkable.

In five years, the rice production, which is the lifeline of the economy, has "leaped" from 729 million tons per year to 650 million tons last year; and this year, reaching new heights, it has "leaped" to the worst harvest in fifty years. It is estimated that this year's rice production will be only half of last year's. The milled rice can only reach the export volume of 1964, and if exported in the quantity of that year, there will be no grain left for a month's consumption at home. The rice exported this year is only about forty million tons, just to keep up appearances.

During the Second World War, when the entire country was engulfed in flames, there was never a famine. But as soon as Ne Win took the "road to socialism," there was a "leapfrog," and people had no food to eat. Last year, only 98 million tons of rice were supplied domestically, and this year it "leaped" to 71 million tons. With the new rice not yet on the market, the rice for sale has already been mostly sold out. Now, even in the capital Yangon, one of the world's three major rice markets, each person is only rationed one can of milk rice (about 0.7 pounds) per day, and the supply is not guaranteed. Restaurants often do not serve meals, and people can only endure hunger, tasting the oil-less "Ne Win dishes." Because the imported cooking oil is also "leaping" in quantity day by day.

If we say that Burma's "leapfrog" is all sarcasm, it is not fair, because Burma's price "leapfrog" is indeed true. Due to hunger, workers are leaving factories en masse, production is halted, the market is chaotic, and daily necessities are in short supply, even salt is scarce. Goods are scarce and prices are high. The price of rice in Yangon has "leaped" by one to two times, and in the free market, it has "leaped" by thirty times. Once the price of rice "leaps," the prices of other goods follow suit. Amidst this "leapfrog," the Ne Win clique takes advantage of the chaos, engages in black market activities, hoards goods, and speculates. Even toothbrushes, soap, and toilet paper can only be bought in the black market.

Severe grain shortages and economic crises have sparked widespread dissatisfaction. According to Burmese reports, collective grain looting incidents are happening everywhere, whether in warehouses, rice mills, or barges, "people go to places where they think they can find rice to loot grain from house to house." Each time, there are as many as five thousand people. The reactionary authorities even open fire to suppress the situation, and many people are killed or injured. The situation is developing. The Ne Win clique is in a state of panic, and even Ne Win himself has to admit: "It has fallen into chaos."

Economic "chaos" is a reflection of political "chaos." Burma's economic crisis is the inevitable result of a series of reactionary political and economic policies pursued by the Ne Win government.

Politically, Ne Win is Burma's Chiang Kai-shek. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Dictatorship, civil war, and selling out the country are one and the same, this is the basic point of Chiang Kai-shek's policy." Ne Win also similarly implements this "three-in-one" reactionary policy, causing Burma's economy to suffer severe damage.

The Ne Win clique's ruthless plunder, intensified exploitation, plus heavy taxes, make it impossible for the Burmese people, especially farmers, to live. Landlords, usurers, and reactionary soldiers seize at least thirteen thousand acres of land from farmers every year. The vast rural areas are impoverished, and the cries of the people are everywhere. The rural economy is on the verge of collapse.

Can the Burmese people continue to live as before? Can the Ne Win clique continue to rule as before? No! The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "The cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the landlord class against the peasants force the peasants to rise up repeatedly to resist the rule of the landlord class." The Ne Win clique's bloody rule forces the Burmese peasants to rise up in rebellion. This rebellion is justified and well-deserved! Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Burma, they adhere to Chairman Mao's great truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and are using armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution. The people's war is raging, and the Ne Win clique is in a state of panic, unable to rest. Their master, the American imperialists, also exclaims that Burma will soon become a second South Vietnam.

But what use is panic and exclamation? The storm of armed struggle by the Burmese people on the Irrawaddy River has already arrived. Let the storm become even more violent!

　　让伊洛瓦底江上的暴风雨来得更猛烈些吧！
　　粮食部革命大联合委员会　红粮兵
    伊洛瓦底江在咆哮，掸邦高原在怒吼。黑沉沉的缅甸啊，在暴风雨的闪电中，有红旗飘飘。缅甸共产党正领导着缅甸人民，掀起了武装斗争的大风暴。
    富饶的伊洛瓦底江三角洲，是世界闻名的米仓。缅甸的大米是它主要的经济命脉。以大米为主体的农业总产值，占工农业总产值的百分之七十左右。大米的出口，占它全部外汇收入的百分之八十五至九十五。自本世纪以来，缅甸一直是著名的大米输出国。
    伊洛瓦底江，昼夜奔流，依然如故；然而，奈温反动集团的法西斯魔影，却笼罩着缅甸的上空。富饶的缅甸啊，陷入了饥饿、黑暗的深渊。驰名全球的大米之仓，竟一落千丈，变成了饥馑之乡。缅甸反动政府的报纸，公然要求人们勒紧裤带，“一天吃一餐”，“准备挨饿”。许多农村还出现了吃草根、啃树皮的现象。身居米仓饿肚皮，世界出口大米最多的国家没饭吃。这就是奈温的所谓“社会主义”的缩影，也是他暴政的归宿。
    这个嗜血成性、反动透顶的奈温集团，为了招摇撞骗，也拚命打起“社会主义”的旗号。把他那套独裁、暴戾、反共、反人民的罪恶计划，名之曰“社会主义纲领”；把他那个以反动军官为骨干，代表缅甸封建地主与官僚资产阶级利益的法西斯独裁工具，名之曰“社会主义纲领党”。
    有人出丑，就有人捧场。缅甸奈温集团伪称自己的国家“走向了社会主义的缅甸道路”，苏修集团便说什么“缅甸的社会主义道路，否定了资本主义道路”。奈温集团吹嘘自己的成绩，苏修集团便跟着肉麻地赞颂奈温上台这五年是缅甸“飞跃的年代”。
    好一个“社会主义道路”，好一个“飞跃的年代”！确实，在奈温走上“社会主义道路”的这五年中，缅甸的“飞跃”也可谓多矣。
    五年来，作为经济命脉的大米产量由每年七百二十九万吨“飞跃”到去年的六百五十万吨；而今年，百尺竿头，更“跃”为五十年来从未有过的大歉收。据估计，今年大米产量，将只及去年的一半。碾出的大米，只能达到一九六四年的出口量，若按那年的数量出口，国内连一个月的口粮也剩不下了。
    随着大米产量的“飞跃”，出口量也在“飞跃”。战前一年出口三百万吨，到了一九六三年就降为一百七十万吨，去年又降为一百一十万吨。而今年，又来个大“飞跃”，拚命勒紧裤带，“一天只吃一餐”，也只能挤凑出四十多万吨来应应门面。
    二次大战期间，缅甸全国燃遍战火，都从未闹过饥荒。而奈温一走上“社会主义道路”，就来了个“飞跃”，“跃”到没有饭吃。去年国内只供应九十八万吨大米，今年又“飞跃”到七十一万吨。离年底新米登场尚远，供销售的大米却已大部卖完。现在，连首都仰光，这个世界有名的三大米市之一，每人每天也只能配给一牛奶罐大米（约零点七磅），且还不能保证供应。饭馆里经常不供饭，人们只好忍着饿，品尝着缺油的“奈温菜”。因为依靠进口的食油，其数量也在逐日“飞跃”。
    如果说缅甸的“飞跃”都是反话，那也不公道，因为缅甸物价的“飞跃”倒是千真万确的。由于饥饿，工人纷纷离厂，生产停顿，市场混乱，日用必需品奇缺，甚至连食盐也很少。货缺价涨，仰光的米价已“飞跃”了一倍至两倍，自由市场上更大“飞跃”了三十倍。米价一“飞跃”，其它物价也就跟着“飞跃”起来了。在这一片“飞跃”中，奈温集团便趁火打劫，大搞黑市，囤积居奇，投机倒把。弄得连牙刷、肥皂、手纸等也得到黑市上才能买到。
    严重的粮荒与经济危机，引起普遍的不满。据缅报透露，集体抢粮事件到处发生，无论仓库、米厂、驳船，“人们到他们认为可以找到大米的地方去挨家抢粮。”每次多至五千余人。反动当局竟开枪弹压，许多人被打死、打伤。事态正在发展。奈温集团被搞得焦头烂额，连他本人也不得不承认：“陷入混乱”了。
    经济“混乱”是政治“混乱”的反映。缅甸的经济危机正是奈温政府推行一系列反动政治、经济政策的必然恶果。
    政治上，奈温就是缅甸的蒋介石。正如毛主席指出的：“独裁、内战和卖国三位一体，这一贯是蒋介石方针的基本点。”奈温也同样推行了这样“三位一体”的反动政策，使缅甸经济遭到严重摧残。
    奈温集团残酷的掠夺，变本加厉的盘剥，再加上苛捐杂税，缅甸人民尤其是农民再也无法生活下去了，地主、高利贷者、反动军人每年至少从农民手中夺去十三万英亩的土地。广大农村，赤贫如洗，哀鸿遍野。农村经济完全濒于破产。
    缅甸人民还能照旧生活下去吗？奈温集团还能照旧统治下去吗？不能！伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”奈温集团的血腥统治，逼得缅甸农民纷纷起来造反。这个反造得有理，造得好！他们在缅甸共产党的领导下，坚持毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理，正以武装的革命来反对武装的反革命。人民战争如火如荼，奈温集团惶惶不可终日，其主子美帝也惊呼，缅甸不久将要成为第二个南越。
    然而，惶恐、惊呼又有何用？伊洛瓦底江上缅甸人民武装斗争的暴风雨已经来临，让暴风雨来得更加猛烈些吧！
