The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, in recent times, has been awarding medals and honors to a large number of reactionary writers, encouraging them to produce more counter-revolutionary poisonous weeds. At the same time, they have been eager to rehabilitate some notorious literary zombies, reprinting their counter-revolutionary works. Thus, the Soviet revisionist clique has further turned the Soviet literary realm, which they have already made into a stinking mess, into a world of ghosts and demons.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "A certain kind of culture (as an ideological form) is a reflection of the politics and economy of a certain society, and it also exerts a great influence and plays a role in the politics and economy of a certain society." The Soviet revisionist clique, in politics, implements the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and comprehensively restores capitalism. Therefore, they must promote counter-revolutionary culture that is anti-proletarian dictatorship and anti-socialism. It is not surprising that the Soviet revisionist clique takes a series of counter-revolutionary measures in the literary and artistic circles.

In the Soviet literary and artistic field, there has been a sharp class struggle for decades. In the past period of proletarian dictatorship, the overthrown bourgeoisie never stopped using literary works to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system and restore their lost paradise. After the revisionist clique of Khrushchev seized power, they released a large number of poisonous weeds that defame the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, preparing public opinion for their comprehensive restoration of capitalism. Now, the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique go even further to mobilize various reactionary writers to serve their reactionary regime, maintain their revisionist rule, and consolidate their bourgeois dictatorship.

The Soviet revisionist clique actually digs out some literary zombies who have long been spat upon by the Soviet people. This shows their shameless degeneration and also exposes their desperation. However, whether it is the still-living figures like Sholokhov and Simonov, or the deceased ones like Zoshchenko and Ehrenburg, none of them can save the Soviet revisionist clique. The Soviet people will one day bury them thoroughly.

    文艺僵尸救不了苏修集团的命
    苏修统治集团一个时期以来，一面给大批反动文人发奖授勋，鼓励他们加紧炮制反革命毒草，一面热中为臭名昭著的一些文艺僵尸翻案，重新出版他们的反革命作品。这样，苏修集团就把已经被他们搞得乌烟瘴气的苏联文艺领域进一步变成为魑魅魍魉的世界。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说过：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济”。苏修集团在政治上实行资产阶级专政，全面复辟资本主义，他们就必然要大搞反无产阶级专政、反社会主义的反动文化。苏修集团在文艺界中采取这一系列反革命措施，是毫不奇怪的。
    在苏联文学艺术领域中，几十年来一直存在着尖锐的阶级斗争。在过去无产阶级专政时期，被推翻了的资产阶级从来也没有停止过利用文艺作品来进行反革命活动，企图颠覆无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，恢复他们失去了的天堂。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺政权以后，就放出大批丑化无产阶级专政和社会主义制度的毒草，为他们全面复辟资本主义准备舆论。现在，勃列日?夫、柯西金之流，则更进一步要调动形形色色的反动文人来为他们的反动政权服务，维持他们的修正主义统治，巩固他们的资产阶级专政。
    苏修集团竟然把一些早已被苏联人民唾弃的文艺僵尸从棺材中挖出来，这表明了他们的无耻堕落，也暴露出他们的黔驴技穷。但是，不论是还活着的什么肖洛霍夫、西蒙诺夫之流也好，已经死去的什么左琴科、爱伦堡之类也好，都绝对救不了苏修集团的命。苏联人民终有一天必将把他们彻底埋葬。
