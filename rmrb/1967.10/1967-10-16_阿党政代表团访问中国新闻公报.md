New China News Agency, October 15 — The Albanian Party and Government Delegation, led by Comrade Muhamed Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, visited the People's Republic of China from September 26 to October 14, 1967, at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China. They celebrated the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China together with the Chinese people and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, met with Comrade Muhamed Shehu, head of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, Comrade Ramiz Alia, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and other members of the delegation, and had a very cordial conversation.

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation visited Beijing, Jinan, Qingdao, Dazhai, Taiyuan, Yan'an, and Shanghai, and at the special invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong, visited Wuhan. The delegation visited factories, communes, military units, schools, and other cultural and educational institutions, and had extensive contact with Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. They held cordial meetings and discussions, learned in detail about the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and personally saw the excellent situation and brilliant victories of the Cultural Revolution. The delegation was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people everywhere they went, and the festive atmosphere everywhere vividly reflected the deep revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples.

During the visit, Comrade Zhou Enlai, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, Comrade Kang Sheng, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and Comrade Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, held talks with the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Muhamed Shehu.

The two sides reaffirmed the principles and positions established in the Joint Statement of May 11, 1966. The two sides exchanged experiences on socialist revolution and socialist construction in their respective countries, especially on how to prevent revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, and how to consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system. They further exchanged views on the current international situation and major issues in the international communist movement. This was a talk between close comrades-in-arms and true brothers, conducted in an atmosphere of utmost cordiality and sincerity. The two sides have completely identical views and positions on the issues discussed.

Those who participated in the talks from the Chinese side included Comrade Liu Ningyi, member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Comrade Yang Chengwu, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Acting Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, Comrade Liu Xiao, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Ambassador to Albania, Comrade Luo Guibo, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Comrade Fang Yi, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Foreign Economic Liaison Commission, and Comrade Li Tianyou, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, among others.

Those who participated in the talks from the Albanian side included Comrade Ramiz Alia, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Comrade Mihallaq Qishku, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and First Secretary of the Korça Regional Party Committee, Comrade Rahman Perlaku, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Political Commissar of the Coastal Defense Forces, Comrade Tonin Jakova, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and General Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions, Comrade Akim Merko, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Albanian Labor Youth, Comrade Fotos Çami, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Comrade Pirro Bita, head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Comrade Vasili Natanaili, Albanian Ambassador to China.

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation highly praises China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They believe that the Cultural Revolution, conducted according to the revolutionary theories and thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, the rightful successor and inheritor of the great Marxist-Leninists Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, has defended and further developed Marxism-Leninism and has made and is making outstanding contributions to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism.

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation fully supports Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line and resolutely condemns the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his criminal conspiracy and activities to restore capitalism in China. The Albanian Party and Government Delegation pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has historical significance for the international communist movement and all oppressed nations in the world. The attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the touchstone today to distinguish Marxist-Leninists from revisionists and true revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people will firmly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and will support it to the end.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people sincerely thank the Albanian Labor Party for its high praise and full support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are in the midst of a revolutionary high tide.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people highly praise and deeply admire the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people for hoisting high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and achieving brilliant successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and for establishing historic merits in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique and the Tito renegade clique.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people highly praise the mass revolutionary movement that is being carried out in Albania. This revolutionary movement is a vivid manifestation of the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to the revolutionary practice of their own country. It not only has profound significance for Albania in preventing the restoration of capitalism and consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, but also enriches the experience of the international proletarian dictatorship.

Heroic Albania, under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Labor Party, has become a great socialist beacon in Europe.

The Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the Chinese people firmly support Comrade Enver Hoxha's solemn warning to U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Greek fascist regime in his speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Albanian Democratic Front on September 14, 1967. The Albanian people are the closest comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries must count the two countries of China and Albania together. If anyone dares to attack Albania, the Chinese people will resolutely stand as a strong rear guard for the Albanian people.

The Albanian Labor Party, the People's Republic of Albania, and the Albanian people resolutely condemn the frenzied anti-China campaign launched by U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, as well as their provocations and conspiracies against China. The U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries are afraid of the historical victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the repercussions it will have in all countries under the rule of the capitalist-revisionist clique. They have formed an anti-revolutionary, anti-China alliance. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and under the brilliant guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, great China has become an invincible defender of socialism and revolution, a loyal and powerful pillar of the revolutionary liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries, an insurmountable obstacle to the imperialists and revisionists in their plan to conquer the world, and a banner-bearer of Marxism-Leninism. The task of the day is to unite with the People's Republic of China in its struggle, to defend it from the malicious slander and conspiracies of the imperialists, revisionists, and their lackeys, and to safeguard the fate of the world revolution. This is an objective necessity of historical significance.

The two sides unanimously pointed out that anti-imperialism must be anti-revisionism. The two sides strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin for colluding with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of all countries to launch frenzied anti-China, anti-Albania, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary criminal activities throughout the world; strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist clique's conspiracy with U.S. imperialism to manufacture the "peace talks" fraud, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression for national salvation; strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist clique's great betrayal of the Arab people, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the peoples of the world; and strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist clique's new conspiracy to stage a revisionist counter-revolutionary black meeting.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Communist Party of China strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist clique for completely betraying the path of the October Revolution, fundamentally destroying the historic cause of the October Revolution, the cause of Lenin and Stalin, and the cause of tens of millions of Soviet people. We two parties and all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces in the world are the true and faithful successors of the revolutionary thought and cause of the great October Revolution. The two sides are convinced that the true Soviet communists and the great Soviet people will not allow the betrayal of revisionism to continue, and they will surely rise up to thoroughly smash the Khrushchev renegade clique, restore the glorious traditions of the October Revolution, and bring great Soviet back to the path of Marxism-Leninism.

The two sides are determined to carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique to the end, and to promote the development of the world revolutionary movement. They firmly support the revolutionary struggles of all genuine Marxist-Leninists in the world.

The two sides are determined to carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end, and to strongly support the Vietnamese people's heroic war against U.S. aggression for national salvation, the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the struggles of the Arab people against the aggression of imperialism and revisionism, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world.

The two sides are pleased to note that the friendship between China and Albania, personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is constantly being consolidated and developed. The visit to China by the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Muhamed Shehu has made new and major contributions to further strengthening the revolutionary friendship and unity between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples. The two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania will forever stand shoulder to shoulder and advance courageously in the common struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and for the victory of socialism and communism.

    新华社十五日讯　阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中华人民共和国新闻公报
    由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，应中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国政府的邀请，于一九六七年九月二十六日至十月十四日在中国进行了友好访问，同中国人民和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席一道，欢度了中华人民共和国十八周年的国庆节。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，会见了阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团团长穆罕默德·谢胡同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记拉米兹·阿利雅同志，以及阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团其他成员，进行了极其亲切的谈话。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问了北京、济南、青岛、大寨、太原、延安和上海，并且应毛泽东主席的专门邀请，访问了武汉。代表团参观了工厂、人民公社、部队、学校和其他文教机构，同中国的工人、农民、解放军指战员、红卫兵、革命干部和革命知识分子进行了广泛的接触，举行了亲切的会见和座谈，详细了解了中国无产阶级文化大革命的情况，亲自看到了文化大革命的大好形势及其光辉胜利。代表团在各地受到了中国人民盛大、热烈、隆重的欢迎，到处呈现出一片欢腾的节日景象，生动地体现了中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的深厚的战斗友谊。
    在访问期间，中国共产党中央委员会政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，中国共产党中央委员会政治局常委、人大常委会副委员长、中央文革小组顾问康生同志，中国共产党中央委员会政治局常委、国务院副总理李富春同志，同穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团举行了会谈。
    双方重申了一九六六年五月十一日中阿联合声明中所确定的原则和立场。双方就两国社会主义革命和社会主义建设，特别是如何防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，巩固和加强无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，深入地交流了经验。就当前国际形势和国际共产主义运动中的重大问题，进一步交换了意见。这是亲密战友和真正兄弟之间的会谈，是在推心置腹，真诚相见的极其亲切友好的气氛中进行的。双方对所讨论的问题的立场和观点完全一致。
    中国方面参加会谈的有：中共中央书记处书记、人大常委会副委员长刘宁一同志，中共中央候补委员、中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武同志，中共中央委员、中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使刘晓同志，中共中央委员、外交部副部长罗贵波同志，中共中央候补委员、对外经济联络委员会主任方毅同志，中国人民解放军副总参谋长李天佑同志等。
    阿尔巴尼亚方面参加会谈的有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记拉米兹·阿利雅同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、科尔察区委第一书记米哈拉奇·齐奇什蒂同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、海防部队政委拉赫曼·佩尔拉库同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、工会中央理事会总书记托宁·雅科瓦同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央候补委员、劳动青年联盟中央第一书记阿基姆·梅罗同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央候补委员福托·恰米同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央国际部部长皮罗·比塔同志和阿尔巴尼亚驻华大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利同志。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团很高评价中国无产阶级文化大革命。认为根据伟大的马克思列宁主义者，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的业绩的当之无愧的接班人和继承者毛泽东同志的革命学说和思想进行的中国无产阶级文化大革命，保卫和进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，并对马克思列宁主义宝库已经做出和正在做出杰出的贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团完全支持毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线，坚决谴责中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线及其在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋和活动。阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团强调指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命对国际共产主义运动和世界所有被压迫民族都具有历史意义。对中国无产阶级文化大革命采取什么态度，是今天区分马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者，区分真革命和反革命的试金石。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民将坚定地支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，并将支持到底。
    中国共产党和中国人民衷心感谢阿尔巴尼亚劳动党对中国无产阶级文化大革命的很高评价和完全支持，这对于正处在革命高潮中的中国人民是极大的鼓舞。
    中国共产党和中国人民很高评价和十分钦佩阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了光辉成就，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义以及铁托叛徒集团的斗争中建立了历史性功勋。
    中国共产党和中国人民很高评价阿尔巴尼亚正在不断深入开展的轰轰烈烈的群众性的革命化运动。这场革命化运动是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党把马克思列宁主义创造地运用于本国革命实践的生动表现，不仅对于阿尔巴尼亚防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政具有深远意义，而且丰富了国际无产阶级专政的经验。
    英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义明灯。
    中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民坚决支持恩维尔·霍查同志一九六七年九月十四日在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上讲话中向美帝国主义、苏修集团和希腊法西斯当局提出的严正警告。阿尔巴尼亚人民是中国人民最亲密的战友。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派必须把中阿两国计算在一起。如果谁胆敢进攻阿尔巴尼亚，中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决谴责美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和各国反动派掀起的疯狂反华高潮，以及对中国的挑衅和阴谋。美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和各国反动派害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命的历史胜利，害怕这场革命在资本主义修正主义集团统治下的所有国家引起的反响，结成了反革命反华联盟。伟大的人民中国，在中国共产党的领导下，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，成了社会主义和革命的所向无敌的捍卫者，成了各国人民及其革命解放斗争的忠实的、强大的支柱，成了帝国主义和修正主义实现其霸占世界计划时不可逾越的障碍，成了马克思列宁主义的旗手。各国人民和全世界所有革命力量同中华人民共和国的战斗团结，捍卫中华人民共和国，使其不受帝国主义者、修正主义者及其走狗的恶毒诽谤和阴谋诡计的危害，这是今天的一个根本任务，是对世界革命命运具有历史意义的客观必要。
    双方一致指出，反帝必须反修。双方强烈谴责以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修集团勾结美帝国主义和各国反动派，在全世界策动疯狂的反华、反阿尔巴尼亚、反共、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动；强烈谴责苏修集团伙同美帝国主义制造“和谈”骗局，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争烈火的罪恶阴谋；强烈谴责苏修集团对阿拉伯人民，对亚非拉人民，对全世界人民的大叛卖；强烈谴责苏修集团策划修正主义反革命黑会的新阴谋。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党强烈谴责苏修集团完全背叛了十月革命的道路，从根本上破坏了十月革命的历史性事业、列宁和斯大林的事业、千百万苏联人民的事业。我们两党、世界上所有马克思列宁主义政党和力量，是伟大十月的革命思想和革命事业的真正的、忠实的继承者。双方深信，真正的苏联共产党人和伟大的苏联人民决不会容忍修正主义背叛继续下去，他们一定会起来，彻底打倒和粉碎赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团，重兴十月革命的光荣传统，使伟大的苏联重新回到马克思列宁主义的道路上来。
    双方决心把反对以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，全力促进世界革命运动的发展，坚决支持全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者的革命斗争。
    双方决心把反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争进行到底，大力支持越南人民抗美救国的英勇战争，大力支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放斗争，大力支持阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义—修正主义侵略的斗争和全世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    双方满意地指出，由中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲自缔造的、建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的中阿友谊，正在不断巩固和发展。以穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团这次访问中国，为进一步加强中阿两党、两国和两国人民的战斗友谊和革命团结，作出了新的重大贡献。中阿两党、两国和两国人民将永远肩并肩地站在一起，在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，争取社会主义和共产主义胜利的共同斗争中，奋勇前进。
                                      一九六七年十月十四日
