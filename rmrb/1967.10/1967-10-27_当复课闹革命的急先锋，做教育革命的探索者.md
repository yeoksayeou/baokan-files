When the Central People's Broadcasting Station had just finished broadcasting the *People's Daily* editorial "All Schools, Big, Medium, and Small, Should Resume Classes and Make Revolution," our school was filled with excitement. All revolutionary teachers, students, and staff responded immediately, taking swift and decisive action. They held discussions overnight, unanimously declaring: We will be the vanguard of resuming classes and making revolution, and the pioneers of educational revolution. Graduating students declared: We will stand our last watch and contribute our strength to resuming classes and making revolution! Many teachers and cadres declared: We will discard the "fear" and replace it with "dare," bravely stepping onto the stage of educational revolution. Even cadres who made mistakes declared: We will learn from the revolutionary youngsters, make amends, and achieve new merits in resuming classes and making revolution!

Resuming classes and making revolution is an urgent need for the development of the Cultural Revolution at this stage, and it is also the common aspiration of all teachers and students. Over the past year, the revolutionary masses of our school, in the struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the agricultural front and in our school, have achieved decisive victories. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions, raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, exposed, criticized, and fought against the enemy. All revolutionary teachers and students united as one, with a common goal, based on Mao Zedong Thought, and achieved revolutionary great unity according to classes, grades, and departments. We also focused on criticizing the reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a few," helping revolutionary cadres and teachers discard the "fear" and bravely come out to make revolution. We absorbed three revolutionary leading cadres to participate in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership team, establishing the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Agricultural University. This cleared the way for further carrying out revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, for reforming the old educational system, and for reforming old teaching principles and methods. Under these circumstances, all revolutionary teachers and students immediately took action, responding to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and officially began resuming classes and making revolution on October 21st.

Although our school has resumed classes and is making revolution, the tasks before us are arduous because resuming classes and making revolution is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. It is a struggle between two worldviews. Resuming classes and making revolution, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school, is a great and magnificent revolutionary cause. It is the glorious and arduous historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. We are determined to make our greatest contribution to this cause!

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in resuming classes and making revolution and in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school. We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instruction of "criticizing and repudiating revisionism," and in resuming classes and making revolution, we firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, thoroughly criticize and repudiate "selfishness," thoroughly criticize and repudiate petty-bourgeois factionalism, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeois worldview, thoroughly criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices in the field of agriculture, and thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. We will let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions and let the educational front be firmly grasped by the revolutionary masses.

Resuming classes and making revolution is also a fierce class struggle, a serious struggle between "public" and "private," and between "revolution" and "conservation." We are determined to engage in a great battle with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the revisionist educational line, and we are determined to completely break with the bourgeois worldview and old social customs. "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." We will truly make our school a new-type agricultural university that meets the needs of the five hundred million peasants, and a great school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

    当复课闹革命的急先锋，做教育革命的探索者
    北京农业大学革命委员会红代会北农大东方红公社
    当中央人民广播电台刚播完《人民日报》社论《大、中、小学校都要复课闹革命》，我校就一片欢腾，全校革命师生员工闻风而动，雷厉风行，连夜进行漫谈讨论，一致表示：要当复课闹革命的急先锋，做教育革命的探索者。毕业班的同学表示：决心站好最后一班岗，在复课闹革命中尽自己一份力量！许多教师、干部表示：丢掉“怕”字，换上“敢”字，勇敢地登上教育革命的舞台。犯了错误的干部也表示：决心向革命小将学习，将功补过，在复课闹革命中立新功！
    复课闹革命，是无产阶级文化大革命发展到现阶段的迫切需要，也是广大师生的共同愿望。一年多来，我校无产阶级革命派在与中国赫鲁晓夫及其在农业战线和在我校的代理人的斗争中，取得了决定性的胜利。我们遵照毛主席的教导，高举革命大批判的旗帜，大揭发，大批判，大斗争，全体革命师生团结一致，共同对敌，目标一致，在毛泽东思想基础上，按照教学班、级、系，实现了革命的大联合。我们还着重地批判了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，帮助革命干部和教师丢掉“怕”字，勇敢地站出来革命。我们吸收了三名革命领导干部参加革命三结合的领导班子，建立起北京农业大学革命委员会。这就为进一步开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，为改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法扫清了道路。在这种情况下，广大革命师生立即行动起来，响应毛主席和党中央的号召，在本月二十一日正式开始复课闹革命。
    我校虽然复课闹革命了，但摆在我们面前的任务是艰巨的，因为复课闹革命，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是两种世界观的斗争。复课闹革命，搞好学校的斗、批、改，是一个伟大而豪迈的革命事业，是毛主席赋予我们这一代的光荣而艰巨的历史任务，我们决心为此作出自己最大的贡献！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是搞好复课闹革命和学校斗、批、改的根本保证。我们坚决执行毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大指示，在复课闹革命中，大立毛泽东思想，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，大破“私”字，大破小资产阶级派性，大破资产阶级世界观，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙在农业方面的滔天罪行，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，让教育阵地牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。
    复课闹革命，又是一场激烈的阶级斗争，一场“公”与“私”、“革”和“保”的严肃斗争。我们决心与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和修正主义教育路线进行一场大厮杀，决心同资产阶级世界观和旧的社会习惯势力彻底决裂。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”把我校真正办成一所为五亿农民所需要的、新型的农业大学，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
