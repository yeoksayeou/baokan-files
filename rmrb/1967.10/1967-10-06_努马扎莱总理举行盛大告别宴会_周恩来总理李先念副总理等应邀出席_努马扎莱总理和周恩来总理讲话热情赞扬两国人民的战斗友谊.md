The Prime Minister of the Congo (Brazzaville), Ambassador Noumazalaye, and the delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement of the Congo (Brazzaville) and the government, led by him, held a grand farewell banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Zhou Jianren, and others were invited to attend the banquet.

The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. Noumazalaye and Zhou Enlai delivered speeches at the banquet, both expressing their enthusiasm for the fighting friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, Noumazalaye first, on behalf of President Massamba-Debat of the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville), the Congolese government, and the Congolese people, and in his personal capacity, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Premier Zhou and the Chinese comrades attending the banquet.

Noumazalaye said, "We had the opportunity to meet and talk with the Red Guards, students, soldiers, workers, and peasants. Through these meetings and conversations, we learned that everyone is striving to study and apply the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong. We also saw that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's invincible thoughts, are truly transforming their country. We believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, will further accelerate the revolutionization of the masses, enabling them to fulfill their internationalist duties."

Noumazalaye said, "The Congo (Brazzaville) highly values the friendship between the Congo (Brazzaville) and the People's Republic of China. Chinese aid has not only enabled us to defeat the plot to strangle our economy but has also especially allowed us to lay the foundation for building a truly independent economy in our country. He said, "When the People's Republic of China aided our country, it did not haggle like imperialism and old and new colonialism, but fully demonstrated a spirit of understanding and brotherhood, respecting our dignity and sovereignty."

Noumazalaye strongly condemned the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam. He said, "We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people will definitely defeat U.S. imperialism and its running dogs."

Premier Zhou Enlai, at the farewell banquet for Noumazalaye, first, on behalf of the Chinese comrades attending the banquet, expressed his heartfelt thanks for being able to participate in the grand banquet hosted by Noumazalaye and the delegation led by Noumazalaye.

Premier Zhou Enlai warmly praised the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville). He emphasized, "Why do the Chinese people have such deep friendship with friends from the Congo (Brazzaville) and Africa? This is not only because the Chinese people and the African people have shared the common experience of suffering from imperialist aggression and oppression in the past, and today face the common task of anti-imperialist struggle; but also because the Chinese people, armed with the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, fully understand: if the oppressed peoples and nations of the world do not achieve liberation, then the Chinese people cannot achieve thorough liberation."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "The Congolese (Brazzaville) friends regard China as a completely reliable comrade-in-arms, which is a great trust and support for us. The Chinese people will not disappoint such expectations. The friendship between us is sincere, not false. This friendship can stand the test. In the common struggle against imperialism, the friendship between the Chinese people and the Congolese (Brazzaville) and African peoples will be increasingly consolidated and developed."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "Noumazalaye and the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends enthusiastically praised our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, refuted the slander and attacks of imperialism and its running dogs, and expressed their belief that this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will make China a socialist country with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science, modern culture, and modern national defense. This is a great trust, encouragement, and support for the Chinese people."

Premier Zhou Enlai said, "In 1964, President Massamba-Debat of the Congo (Brazzaville) visited our country, which opened a new chapter in the friendly relations between our two countries. We are pleased to see that Noumazalaye's visit this time has further advanced the friendly relations between our two countries. This not only serves the interests of our two peoples but also helps to strengthen the anti-imperialist cause of unity among the peoples of Asia and Africa."

The speeches of Noumazalaye and Zhou Enlai were met with extremely enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

Also present at the banquet were officials from various government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The Congolese (Brazzaville) Ambassador to China, Bazanga, and diplomats from various countries also attended the banquet. Zhou Enlai and Noumazalaye at the banquet.

    新华社五日讯　刚果（布）全国革命运动中央委员会第一书记、总理、政府首脑安布鲁瓦斯·努马扎莱和由他率领的刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团，今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大的告别宴会。
    国务院总理周恩来、副总理李先念，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、周建人等应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会充满了友好和团结的热烈气氛。努马扎莱总理和周恩来总理在宴会上先后发表热情的讲话（全文均见第五版）。
    努马扎莱总理在讲话中首先代表刚果（布）共和国总统马桑巴—代巴，代表刚果政府和刚果人民，并以他个人的名义，向周总理和出席宴会的中国同志表示十分诚挚的谢意。
    努马扎莱总理说，我们有机会同红卫兵、学生、士兵、工人和农民群众进行了接触和谈话。通过这些接触和谈话，我们了解到每个人都在努力学习和运用毛泽东主席的战无不胜的思想。我们还看到，中国人民在毛泽东主席的战无不胜的思想的指导下，真正在改造自己的国家。我们相信，由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，必将进一步加速人民群众的革命化，使他们能够完成自己的国际主义的任务。
    努马扎莱总理说，刚果（布）高度评价刚果（布）同中华人民共和国的友谊。中国的援助使我们不仅能够胜利地击败了窒息我国经济的图谋，而且特别使我们能够开始为我国建立真正独立的经济奠定了基础。他说，中华人民共和国在援助我国的时候，并不象帝国主义和新老殖民主义那样讨价还价，而是充分表现出谅解和兄弟般的精神，尊重我国的尊严和主权。
    努马扎莱总理最后强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗在越南进行的侵略战争。他说，我们坚信，越南人民必将战胜美帝国主义及其走狗。
    周恩来总理在努马扎莱总理告别宴会上，首先代表出席宴会的中国同志，对能够参加努马扎莱总理和由努马扎莱总理率领的代表团举行的盛大宴会，表示衷心的感谢。
    周恩来总理热烈赞扬中国和刚果（布）两国人民的战斗友谊。他强调说，为什么中国人民对刚果（布）和非洲的朋友们有这样深厚的友谊呢？这不仅是因为中国人民同非洲人民在过去有受殖民主义侵略压迫的共同遭遇，今天又面临着反帝斗争的共同任务；而且是因为用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，完全懂得：如果全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族得不到解放，那么，中国人民也就不能得到彻底的解放。
    周恩来总理说，刚果（布）朋友把中国看作完全可以信赖的战友，这是对我们很大的信任和支持。中国人民决不辜负这种期望。我们之间的友谊是真诚的，而不是虚假的。这种友谊是经得起考验的。在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，中国人民同刚果（布）和非洲人民的友谊，必将日益巩固和发展。
    周恩来总理说，努马扎莱总理和刚果（布）朋友们热情地赞扬了我国文化大革命，驳斥了帝国主义及其走狗的诽谤和攻击，并且表示相信，这场文化大革命将使中国成为一个具有现代农业、现代工业、现代科学、现代文化和现代国防的社会主义国家，这是对中国人民很大的信任、鼓舞和支持。
    周恩来总理说，一九六四年刚果（布）总统马桑巴—代巴阁下来我国访问，为我们两国友好关系开辟了新的局面。我们高兴地看到，努马扎莱总理这次的访问，又把我们两国之间的友好关系向前推进了一步。这不仅符合我们两国人民的利益，而且有助于加强亚非人民的团结反帝事业。
    努马扎莱总理和周恩来总理的讲话，受到全场极为热烈的欢迎。
    出席宴会的还有政府部门、中国人民解放军各方面负责人，以及北京市革命委员会的负责人。（附图片）
