The Ministry of National Defense invites South Vietnamese comrades to report on heroic deeds in the struggle against America. Comrade Nie Rongzhen said that the Chinese military and people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in driving the American imperialists completely and thoroughly out of Vietnamese territory. Comrade Huang Wendan strongly condemns the crimes of American imperialist aggression and is determined to hold his gun tightly, advance victoriously, fight harder, and fight more accurately until the realization of national peace and unification.

Today, a grand report meeting was held in the Great Hall of the People to honor the heroes of the South Vietnamese people who are on the front lines of the anti-American struggle. The delegation of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, led by the combat hero Huang Wendan and his comrades, reported on the heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese military and people in the struggle against American aggression for national liberation.

The report meeting was filled with the spirit of unity and struggle between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and armies. In the center of the stage, there were portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Above the stage, there was a banner written in both Chinese and Vietnamese that read, "Salute to the South Vietnamese People!" Opposite the stage, there were slogans such as, "The Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American struggle for national liberation to the end!" and "Long live the fraternal friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!"

When the heroic South Vietnamese comrades appeared in the Great Hall of the People, the entire hall erupted in cheers. More than ten thousand soldiers and officers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stood up and applauded warmly, giving the warmest welcome to their close South Vietnamese comrades. They shouted slogans: "Learn from the South Vietnamese comrades on the anti-American front!" "Seven hundred million Chinese people swear to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people!" "The Vietnamese people will surely win! The American imperialists will surely lose!" "Long live the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

Vice Premier and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Nie Rongzhen, Deputy Ministers of National Defense Su Yu and Xiao Jinguang, and leaders from various departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, various military branches, the Beijing Military Region, and the Beijing Garrison Command, as well as military leaders from various military regions in Beijing, attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Su Yu.

Ambassador Vu Minh Quan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China and Military Attaché Chen Wenping, and Deputy Head of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front's Permanent Delegation to China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, were also invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting began with the singing of the "Internationale." Both on and off the stage, people read aloud in both Chinese and Vietnamese the words of Chairman Mao: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will inevitably deal a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world. The great victory of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation is a powerful proof of this." They sincerely wished our red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

Nie Rongzhen delivered a welcome speech at the meeting. On behalf of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all attendees, he extended the highest respect to our close comrades, the representatives of the South Vietnamese people from the front lines of the struggle against American aggression, and to the heroic South Vietnamese people.

Nie Rongzhen highly praised the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation. He said that the heroic Vietnamese people, in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call for "decisive battle and decisive victory," have united in the north and south, fought against the enemy with indomitable spirit, and created an unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation. The South Vietnamese military and people have creatively used the treasure of people's war, unleashing its immense power, thwarting the so-called "special war" meticulously planned by American imperialism, annihilating a large number of the enemy's forces, and turning vast areas into invincible revolutionary bases. They have beaten the world's number one imperialist bandit into a state of panic and disarray. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "American imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The struggle of the Chinese people has proven this. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is proving this." The heroic Vietnamese people have created a shining example of a single country resisting and defeating American imperialism since the end of World War II. The brilliant victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle have set an example of daring to fight and daring to win for all revolutionary peoples of the world, making a very valuable contribution to the common struggle of all revolutionary peoples of the world against American imperialism, and writing a brilliant chapter in the history of national liberation wars of the peoples of the world.

Nie Rongzhen said that recently, American imperialism has been escalating its military adventures, preparing to spread the flames of aggression to the Chinese people and the entire Indochina Peninsula. At the same time, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are colluding to plot a new "peace talk" deception. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will surely be able to raise high the banner of victory in the struggle against American aggression for national liberation, smash all the enemy's tricks and schemes, overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and carry the great struggle against American aggression for national liberation to the end, achieving a thorough victory. The Chinese people resolutely support the solemn pledge made by Chairman Ho Chi Minh in his recent letter to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho and the South Vietnamese people: "Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We Vietnamese people are determined to fight until there is not a single shadow of American aggressors on our beloved land."

Nie Rongzhen said that China and Vietnam are brotherly neighboring countries with a close relationship. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, regarding the support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people as our internationalist duty, and resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation. The Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and provide full support to the Vietnamese people, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people. Seven hundred million Chinese people and the great Chinese People's Liberation Army swear to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. China, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become more solid and powerful. No matter what storms or waves come, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will unswervingly support the Vietnamese people in driving the American aggressors completely, thoroughly, and entirely out of Vietnamese territory.

Combat hero Huang Wendan, who has annihilated more than a hundred American aggressors, and outstanding anti-American warrior Nguyen Thi Tuyet, who is only eighteen years old and has six years of experience fighting against American aggression, gave reports amid warm applause. They recounted their own battle experiences and the heroic stories of the South Vietnamese military and people's struggle against American aggression, strongly condemning the crimes of American imperialist aggression, and determined to carry the struggle against American aggression for national liberation to the end.

After strongly condemning the crimes of American imperialist aggression, Huang Wendan said that in the past few months, the South Vietnamese military and people have advanced victoriously, dealing a fatal blow to the American aggressors and their lackeys, causing them heavy defeats. On the entire battlefield in South Vietnam, from Quang Tri to the fifth interzone plain, the Central Highlands, the southern central region, to the southern eastern region and the Mekong Delta, everywhere is the grave of American soldiers. All American divisions and brigades have been beaten to a pulp, in a state of panic and disarray. The armed forces of South Vietnam are becoming more experienced in fighting. The South Vietnamese military and people have mastered the rules of American imperialist warfare, actively and creatively using the clever tactics of people's war, combining armed struggle with political struggle, and effectively combining concentrated warfare, guerrilla warfare, attacking rear bases, and attacking supply lines. Despite having more troops, the American aggressors and their lackeys still feel short of manpower and are always surrounded by the people's war. The South Vietnamese military and people are fighting stronger and winning more.

Huang Wendan's report expressed the iron will of the South Vietnamese military and people: No matter if it takes five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, we are determined to hold our guns tightly, advance victoriously, fight harder, and fight more accurately until the realization of national peace and unification. He said that this determination is reflected in the political program of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front published on September 1, 1967.

Huang Wendan said that the Chinese people are our close neighbors and loyal comrades who share weal and woe. For the cause of the South Vietnamese people's struggle, the Chinese people have never hesitated to make any sacrifice. The South Vietnamese people clearly know that the Chinese people not only support the revolutionary line of struggle of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front and the five-point declaration of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front but also provide great and effective material assistance to the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people. You have well executed the instructions of Chairman Mao: "The patriotic and just struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the American-Bao Dai clique has achieved great victories, both politically and militarily. We Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people." The South Vietnamese military and people express heartfelt thanks to the brotherly Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their brotherly support.

Huang Wendan said that the fighting unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China is the comradeship of soldiers in the same trench. This brotherly friendship, built on the basis of life and death between the two nations, will stand firm like pines and cypresses, evergreen for all eternity, no matter what storms and rains come.

He said that the South Vietnamese people are confident: We have the strength of national unity, we have the determination to defeat the American aggressors, we have justice, we have the correct line of the National Liberation Front, seventeen million compatriots in the north and we fight together, the brotherly seven hundred million Chinese people as our strong rear guard, and providing us with ever-increasing aid, the people of the world giving us ever-increasing sympathy and support, the patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory.

Huang Wendan also enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said that the South Vietnamese military and people are delighted and regard it as their own achievement.

After the report, Huang Wendan presented the flag of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, symbolizing the determination of the South Vietnamese military and people to defeat the American aggressors, to the Ministry of National Defense of our country and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The representative of the People's Liberation Army pinned the shining Mao badges and Mao quotations badges on the chests of the Vietnamese comrades and presented the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Vietnamese to the South Vietnamese comrades.

The meeting ended victoriously with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    向来自反美斗争最前线的越南南方战斗英雄学习
    国防部邀请南越战友报告抗美英雄事迹
    聂荣臻同志说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国军民坚定不移地支援越南人民把美帝从越南土地上彻底干净全部赶出去黄文旦同志强烈谴责美帝的侵略罪行，决心紧握手中枪，乘胜前进，打的更狠，打的更准，直到实现祖国的和平统一
    新华社七日讯　今天上午在人民大会堂，隆重举行盛大的报告会，邀请来自反美斗争最前线的英雄的越南南方人民的使者——越南南方民族解放阵线代表团团长、战斗英雄黄文旦和他的战友，报告越南南方军民在抗美救国战争中的英雄事迹。
    报告会洋溢着中越两国人民和军队团结战斗的气氛。主席台中央，挂着我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像和越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的画像。主席台正中悬挂着用中越两国文字写成的“向越南南方人民致敬！”的横幅，主席台对面，挂着“中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！”“中越两国人民的兄弟友谊和战斗团结万岁！”等标语。
    当英雄的越南南方战友英姿勃勃地来到人民大会堂时，全场一片欢腾。中国人民解放军陆、海、空军指战员一万多人，全部起立，热烈鼓掌，最热烈地欢迎越南南方的亲密战友。高呼口号：“向来自抗美前线的越南南方战友学习！”“七亿中国人民誓作越南人民的坚强后盾！”“越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！”“越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    国务院副总理、国防委员会副主席聂荣臻、国防部副部长粟裕、萧劲光，中国人民解放军各总部、国防科委、各军种兵种、北京部队、北京卫戍区负责人和各军区在京首长王新亭、袁子钦、张池明、李作鹏、余立金等，以及全军参加国庆观礼的学习毛主席著作积极分子、英雄模范人物和参加“三支”、“两军”工作的代表出席了报告会。报告会由粟裕主持。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾，大使馆武官陈文彭，应邀出席了报告会。越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳也应邀出席了报告会。
    报告会在雄壮的《国际歌》歌声中开始，台上台下用中越两国不同的语言，齐声朗读毛主席语录：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，就是一个有力的证明。”齐声衷心地敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    聂荣臻在报告会上致欢迎词。他代表中华人民共和国国防部、中国人民解放军和到会的全体同志，向我们亲密的战友，来自抗美救国战争前线的越南南方人民的代表，战斗英雄同志们，向英雄的越南南方人民致以最崇高的敬意！
    聂荣臻高度赞扬越南人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的辉煌胜利。他说，英雄的越南人民响应胡志明主席“决战决胜”的伟大号召，在抗美救国战争中，南北一心，同仇敌忾，坚强不屈，打出了空前大好的革命形势，越南南方军民创造性地运用人民战争的法宝，发挥了无比的威力，挫败了美帝国主义精心策划的所谓“特种战争”，大量地歼灭了敌人的有生力量，把广大地区建成了坚不可摧的革命根据地，把世界上头号帝国主义强盗打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“美帝国主义和各国反动派都是纸老虎。中国人民的斗争证明了这一点。越南人民的斗争正在证明这一点。”英雄的越南人民创造了第二次世界大战后一个国家单独抗击和战胜美帝国主义的光辉范例。英雄的越南人民英勇斗争所取得的辉煌胜利，为全世界革命人民树立了一个敢于斗争、敢于胜利的榜样，为全世界革命人民反对美帝国主义的共同斗争做出了十分宝贵的贡献，在世界革命人民民族解放战争的历史上写下了光辉的篇章。
    聂荣臻说，最近，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大军事冒险，准备把侵略战火烧到中国人民头上，烧到整个印度支那，同时，美苏正在加紧勾结，策划新的“和谈”骗局。我们坚信，英雄的越南人民一定能够高举抗美救国战争的胜利旗帜，粉碎敌人的各种阴谋诡计，克服前进道路上的一切困难，把伟大的抗美救国战争进行到底，取得彻底胜利。中国人民坚决支持胡志明主席最近给阮友寿主席和南方人民的信中所宣告的气壮山河的誓言：“炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”
    聂荣臻说，中国同越南是唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦。中国人民、中国人民解放军一向遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把支援越南人民的斗争看作是自己的国际主义义务，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。中国人民决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民，与越南人民并肩战斗。七亿中国人民和伟大的中国人民解放军誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国，变得更加巩固了，更加强大了。不管有什么狂风暴雨，不管有什么惊涛骇浪，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，都将坚定不移地支援越南人民，把美国侵略者从越南土地上彻底、干净、全部赶出去。
    曾经消灭过一百多名美国侵略军的战斗英雄黄文旦和年仅十八岁、有六年抗击美国侵略者战斗经历的优秀歼美勇士吴氏雪，在热烈的掌声中作报告。他们讲述了自己的战斗经历和越南南方军民抗美斗争的英雄故事，强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行，并决心把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    黄文旦在强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行后说，最近几个月以来，越南南方军民又乘胜前进，给予美国侵略者及其走狗以致命打击，使它们遭到沉重的失败。在越南南方整个战场上，从广治承天到第五联区平原，西原地区，中部南区直到南部东区和湄公河平原，到处都是美军的坟墓。美军所有的师和旅都被打得头破血流，狼狈不堪。越南南方解放武装力量越打越有经验。越南南方军民掌握了美帝国主义的作战规律，积极地、创造性地运用了人民战争的巧妙战术，把武装斗争和政治斗争紧紧地结合起来，把集中兵力作战、游击战、打后方基地、打交通线等各种作战方式有效地结合起来，使美国侵略者及其走狗尽管军队再多，仍感兵力不足，始终处于人民战争的重重包围之中。越南南方军民越战越强，越战越胜。
    黄文旦的报告，表达了越南南方军民钢铁般的决心：不管要战斗五年、十年、二十年，甚至更长的时间，我们也决心紧握手中枪，乘胜前进，打的更狠，打的更准，直到实现祖国的和平统一。他说，我们的这种决心已经体现在一九六七年九月一日公布的越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领中。
    黄文旦说，中国人民是我们亲密的邻邦，是同甘苦，共患难的忠实战友。为了越南南方人民的斗争事业，中国人民从来不惜作出任何牺牲。越南南方人民都很清楚地知道中国人民不仅支持越南南方民族解放阵线的革命斗争路线，支持越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，而且还给予越南南方人民的正义斗争以巨大的、有效的物质援助。你们很好地执行了毛主席的指示：“越南南方人民反对美国—吴庭艳集团的爱国正义斗争，不论在政治上或者军事上，都取得了重大的胜利。我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的。”越南南方军民对兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军所给予的兄弟般的支持，表示衷心的感谢。
    黄文旦说，越中两国人民之间的战斗团结，是同一条战壕里的战友之间的情谊。这种建立在两个民族生死与共基础上的兄弟般的亲密友谊，象苍松翠柏一样，不管遇到任何狂风暴雨都将巍然屹立，万古长青。
    他说，越南南方人民坚信：我们有全民团结的力量，我们有战胜美国侵略强盗的决心，我们有正义，我们有民族解放阵线的正确路线，一千七百万北方骨肉同胞和我们同心协力共同战斗，兄弟的七亿中国人民作为我们坚强的后盾，并给予我们日益巨大的援助，全世界人民给予我们日益巨大的同情和支持，我们越南南方人民的爱国斗争就一定能够取得最后胜利。
    黄文旦还热烈地赞扬用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就。他说，越南南方军民对此感到欢欣鼓舞，并把它当作是自己的成就。
    黄文旦在报告后，把越南南方军民决心战胜美国侵略者的越南南方民族解放阵线的旗子赠给我国国防部和中国人民解放军。人民解放军代表把金光闪闪的毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，戴在越南战友胸前，并向越南南方战友赠送红色宝书越文版《毛主席语录》。
    报告会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
