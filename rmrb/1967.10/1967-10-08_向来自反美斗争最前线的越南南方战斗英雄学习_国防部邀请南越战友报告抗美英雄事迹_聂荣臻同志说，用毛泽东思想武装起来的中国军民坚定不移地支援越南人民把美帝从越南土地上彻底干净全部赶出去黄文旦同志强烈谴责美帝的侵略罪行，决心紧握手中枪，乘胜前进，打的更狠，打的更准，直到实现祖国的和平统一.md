The Ministry of National Defense invites South Vietnamese comrades to report on heroic deeds in the struggle against America. Comrade Nie Rongzhen said that the Chinese military and people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in driving the American imperialists completely and thoroughly out of Vietnamese territory. Comrade Huang Wendan strongly condemns the crimes of American imperialist aggression and is determined to hold his gun tightly, advance victoriously, fight harder, and fight more accurately until the realization of national peace and unification.

Today, a grand report meeting was held in the Great Hall of the People to honor the heroes of the South Vietnamese people who are on the front lines of the anti-American struggle. The delegation of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, led by the combat hero Huang Wendan and his comrades, reported on the heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese military and people in the struggle against American aggression for national liberation.

The report meeting was filled with the spirit of unity and struggle between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and armies. In the center of the stage, there were portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Above the stage, there was a banner written in both Chinese and Vietnamese that read, "Salute to the South Vietnamese People!" Opposite the stage, there were slogans such as, "The Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American struggle for national liberation to the end!" and "Long live the fraternal friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!"

When the heroic South Vietnamese comrades appeared in the Great Hall of the People, the entire hall erupted in cheers. More than ten thousand soldiers and officers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stood up and applauded warmly, giving the warmest welcome to their close South Vietnamese comrades. They shouted slogans: "Learn from the South Vietnamese comrades on the anti-American front!" "Seven hundred million Chinese people swear to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people!" "The Vietnamese people will surely win! The American imperialists will surely lose!" "Long live the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

Vice Premier and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Nie Rongzhen, Deputy Ministers of National Defense Su Yu and Xiao Jinguang, and leaders from various departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, various military branches, the Beijing Military Region, and the Beijing Garrison Command, as well as military leaders from various military regions in Beijing, attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Su Yu.

Ambassador Vu Minh Quan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China and Military Attach√© Chen Wenping, and Deputy Head of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front's Permanent Delegation to China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, were also invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting began with the singing of the "Internationale." Both on and off the stage, people read aloud in both Chinese and Vietnamese the words of Chairman Mao: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will inevitably deal a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world. The great victory of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation is a powerful proof of this." They sincerely wished our red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

Nie Rongzhen delivered a welcome speech at the meeting. On behalf of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all attendees, he extended the highest respect to our close comrades, the representatives of the South Vietnamese people from the front lines of the struggle against American aggression, and to the heroic South Vietnamese people.

Nie Rongzhen highly praised the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation. He said that the heroic Vietnamese people, in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call for "decisive battle and decisive victory," have united in the north and south, fought against the enemy with indomitable spirit, and created an unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation. The South Vietnamese military and people have creatively used the treasure of people's war, unleashing its immense power, thwarting the so-called "special war" meticulously planned by American imperialism, annihilating a large number of the enemy's forces, and turning vast areas into invincible revolutionary bases. They have beaten the world's number one imperialist bandit into a state of panic and disarray. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "American imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The struggle of the Chinese people has proven this. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is proving this." The heroic Vietnamese people have created a shining example of a single country resisting and defeating American imperialism since the end of World War II. The brilliant victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle have set an example of daring to fight and daring to win for all revolutionary peoples of the world, making a very valuable contribution to the common struggle of all revolutionary peoples of the world against American imperialism, and writing a brilliant chapter in the history of national liberation wars of the peoples of the world.

Nie Rongzhen said that recently, American imperialism has been escalating its military adventures, preparing to spread the flames of aggression to the Chinese people and the entire Indochina Peninsula. At the same time, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are colluding to plot a new "peace talk" deception. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will surely be able to raise high the banner of victory in the struggle against American aggression for national liberation, smash all the enemy's tricks and schemes, overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and carry the great struggle against American aggression for national liberation to the end, achieving a thorough victory. The Chinese people resolutely support the solemn pledge made by Chairman Ho Chi Minh in his recent letter to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho and the South Vietnamese people: "Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We Vietnamese people are determined to fight until there is not a single shadow of American aggressors on our beloved land."

Nie Rongzhen said that China and Vietnam are brotherly neighboring countries with a close relationship. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, regarding the support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people as our internationalist duty, and resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation. The Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and provide full support to the Vietnamese people, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people. Seven hundred million Chinese people and the great Chinese People's Liberation Army swear to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. China, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become more solid and powerful. No matter what storms or waves come, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will unswervingly support the Vietnamese people in driving the American aggressors completely, thoroughly, and entirely out of Vietnamese territory.

Combat hero Huang Wendan, who has annihilated more than a hundred American aggressors, and outstanding anti-American warrior Nguyen Thi Tuyet, who is only eighteen years old and has six years of experience fighting against American aggression, gave reports amid warm applause. They recounted their own battle experiences and the heroic stories of the South Vietnamese military and people's struggle against American aggression, strongly condemning the crimes of American imperialist aggression, and determined to carry the struggle against American aggression for national liberation to the end.

After strongly condemning the crimes of American imperialist aggression, Huang Wendan said that in the past few months, the South Vietnamese military and people have advanced victoriously, dealing a fatal blow to the American aggressors and their lackeys, causing them heavy defeats. On the entire battlefield in South Vietnam, from Quang Tri to the fifth interzone plain, the Central Highlands, the southern central region, to the southern eastern region and the Mekong Delta, everywhere is the grave of American soldiers. All American divisions and brigades have been beaten to a pulp, in a state of panic and disarray. The armed forces of South Vietnam are becoming more experienced in fighting. The South Vietnamese military and people have mastered the rules of American imperialist warfare, actively and creatively using the clever tactics of people's war, combining armed struggle with political struggle, and effectively combining concentrated warfare, guerrilla warfare, attacking rear bases, and attacking supply lines. Despite having more troops, the American aggressors and their lackeys still feel short of manpower and are always surrounded by the people's war. The South Vietnamese military and people are fighting stronger and winning more.

Huang Wendan's report expressed the iron will of the South Vietnamese military and people: No matter if it takes five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, we are determined to hold our guns tightly, advance victoriously, fight harder, and fight more accurately until the realization of national peace and unification. He said that this determination is reflected in the political program of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front published on September 1, 1967.

Huang Wendan said that the Chinese people are our close neighbors and loyal comrades who share weal and woe. For the cause of the South Vietnamese people's struggle, the Chinese people have never hesitated to make any sacrifice. The South Vietnamese people clearly know that the Chinese people not only support the revolutionary line of struggle of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front and the five-point declaration of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front but also provide great and effective material assistance to the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people. You have well executed the instructions of Chairman Mao: "The patriotic and just struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the American-Bao Dai clique has achieved great victories, both politically and militarily. We Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people." The South Vietnamese military and people express heartfelt thanks to the brotherly Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their brotherly support.

Huang Wendan said that the fighting unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China is the comradeship of soldiers in the same trench. This brotherly friendship, built on the basis of life and death between the two nations, will stand firm like pines and cypresses, evergreen for all eternity, no matter what storms and rains come.

He said that the South Vietnamese people are confident: We have the strength of national unity, we have the determination to defeat the American aggressors, we have justice, we have the correct line of the National Liberation Front, seventeen million compatriots in the north and we fight together, the brotherly seven hundred million Chinese people as our strong rear guard, and providing us with ever-increasing aid, the people of the world giving us ever-increasing sympathy and support, the patriotic struggle of the South Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory.

Huang Wendan also enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said that the South Vietnamese military and people are delighted and regard it as their own achievement.

After the report, Huang Wendan presented the flag of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, symbolizing the determination of the South Vietnamese military and people to defeat the American aggressors, to the Ministry of National Defense of our country and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The representative of the People's Liberation Army pinned the shining Mao badges and Mao quotations badges on the chests of the Vietnamese comrades and presented the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Vietnamese to the South Vietnamese comrades.

The meeting ended victoriously with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."
