The reception was attended by Raul Roa, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Jesus Montanana, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Machado Ventura, Minister of Public Health, Enrique Arce, President of the Supreme Court, and Baldomero, President of the Cuba-China Friendship Association, among others.

	Also present were representatives from various sectors of Cuba, representatives from diplomatic missions of various countries in Cuba, Latin American friends in Cuba, and representatives of the Chinese community in Cuba, totaling more than 800 people.

	Many Cuban friends and friends from other countries at the reception enthusiastically praised the great achievements China has made in the past 18 years and warmly congratulated the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They sincerely wished the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, eternal life. Some foreign friends were so excited that they repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	One Latin American friend pointed out, "The brilliant achievements China has made in the past 18 years are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought." Another Latin American friend said, "The reason why Mao Zedong Thought has such great power is that it is an unshakable truth and the highest Marxism-Leninism of our time."

	One Cuban friend said, "The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in China and prevented the restoration of capitalism in China but also dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism."

    古巴朋友在我国驻古使馆国庆招待会上说
    中国文化大革命沉重打击了美帝苏修
    据新华社哈瓦那电　中国驻古巴大使馆临时代办李善一一日晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。出席招待会的有：古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚，邮电部长赫苏斯·蒙塔尼亚，卫生部长马查多·本图拉，最高法院院长恩里克·阿特，以及古中友协主席巴尔多梅罗等。
    出席招待会的还有：古巴各界代表，各国驻古巴外交使团的代表，在古巴的拉美朋友以及旅古华侨代表，共八百多人。
    到会的许多古巴朋友和其他各国朋友热烈赞扬中国十八年来取得的伟大成就，热烈祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，衷心敬祝中国人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆。有些外国朋友激动地一再高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    一位拉丁美洲朋友指出，“中国十八年来取得的辉煌成就都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”另一位拉丁美洲朋友说，“毛泽东思想之所以具有巨大的威力，在于它是颠扑不破的真理，在于它是当代最高的马克思列宁主义。”
    一位古巴朋友说，“中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利不仅进一步巩固了中国的无产阶级专政，防止了资本主义在中国的复辟，而且对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义是一个沉重的打击。”
