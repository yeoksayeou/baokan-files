The film "Red Sun" is a poisonous weed created according to the tune of the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek. Before writing the script, the screenwriter of the film "Red Sun," Qu Baiyin, claimed to be ill and refused to visit the commander of the main attacking unit of the Menglianggu Battle and the participating troops. Instead, he visited a captured Nationalist general and the secretary of Zhang Lingfu. He also eagerly went to the Nanjing Archives to read the epitaph written by Chiang Kai-shek for Zhang Lingfu. After reading the epitaph written by the Chiang bandits, he was so impressed that he told everyone, "It left a deep impression on me!" He also mimicked Chiang Kai-shek's tone and shouted, "Zhang Lingfu is a true soldier!" "This man is truly a general!"

The reactionary film "Red Sun" was created according to Chiang Kai-shek's "epitaph" to write a biography of Zhang Lingfu.

The "epitaph" says: Zhang Lingfu is "wise and decisive." The film praises Zhang Lingfu for using flanking tactics to break through our military lines and capture Lianhua in one go. In Menglianggu, he also used the tactic of feigning an attack from the east to strike from the west, deceiving our soldiers from the rank of soldier to company commander, battalion commander, brigade commander, and division commander. The film uses the method of vilifying our military to contrast Zhang Lingfu's "wisdom and decisiveness," which is extremely malicious!

The "epitaph" says: Zhang Lingfu "fought bravely and fearlessly until death," "died for a righteous cause." The film praises Zhang Lingfu for still having ambitious plans to "blossom in the center" when our military surrounded Menglianggu. When our military attacked the enemy command post, he remained calm and said, "Stay calm!" When only he was left, he still calmly put on his helmet, picked up his submachine gun to resist, and finally became a "hero" who "died for a righteous cause."

The people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek once boasted, "Where there is the 74th Division, there is the Kuomintang," "With ten such divisions, one can rule the country!" The film goes all out to portray Zhang Lingfu as a "hero of the world" and through the Zhang Lingfu in the film shouting, "This is a good show, we are the main actors!" "Only our 74th Division is worthy of being the main actor!" The reactionary arrogance is at its peak!

Is the reality truly as described by Chiang Kai-shek and his admirer Qu Baiyin? No! On the contrary, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power." Chiang Kai-shek and his "ace" 74th Division are exactly such paper tigers. At that time, the enemy 74th Division suffered heavy casualties in our military's continuous attacks, with nearly half of its personnel killed or wounded. Zhang Lingfu was so afraid that he did not dare to go to the battlefield in Shandong and repeatedly requested the fake Ministry of Defense to transfer the 74th Division to Nanjing for "training." He also made up lies to request leave to "rest and recuperate." In the Menglianggu Battle, it was this Zhang Lingfu, who was praised by the Chiang bandits and the film as "fighting bravely and fearlessly until death," who was so frightened by our powerful People's Liberation Army that he was the first to change into a soldier's uniform and flee.

The director of "Red Sun" deliberately distorts historical facts, stands on the counter-revolutionary position of Chiang Kai-shek, and according to Chiang Kai-shek's black language, praises the enemy 74th Division and creates the counter-revolutionary "hero" Zhang Lingfu.

The Menglianggu Battle has been twenty years. The stone monument that Chiang Kai-shek erected for Zhang Lingfu has long been crushed into dust by the wheels of the revolution along with the collapse of the Chiang family regime. The director picks up some broken bricks and tiles to erect a "spirit tablet" for Zhang Lingfu again. What is their purpose? They are to collaborate with the Chiang bandits' call to "retake the mainland" and dream of achieving a counter-revolutionary restoration in China.

Ants climbing a locust tree boast of a great country, a cicada shaking a tree talks about how easy it is. Eighteen years ago, we completely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilated the eight hundred thousand Chiang bandit troops on the mainland. Eighteen years later, we have even more confidence and strength to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade! Seven hundred million Chinese people are ready for battle, and a few remaining Chiang bandits and their summoners like Qu Baiyin will not have a better fate than the Chiang bandits' 74th Division!

    蒋匪黑话是《红日》的蓝本
    河北北京师院　红延文
    影片《红日》是按照人民公敌蒋介石的调子“创作”出来的大毒草。在写剧本前，影片《红日》的编剧瞿白音推说有病，拒绝去访问当年孟良崮战役我军主攻团的团长和参战的部队，却去登门拜访一个被俘的国民党中将和张灵甫当时的秘书。他还兴致勃勃地跑到南京资料馆，拜读蒋介石为张灵甫写的碑文。他看了蒋匪写的碑文之后，竟佩服得五体投地，逢人就说“给我印象颇深”！他还学着蒋介石的腔调吼叫：“张灵甫是真正的军人！”“这人真是一位将才！”
    反动影片《红日》就是按照蒋介石的“碑文”来为张灵甫立传的。
    “碑文”说：张灵甫“英明果断”。影片就宣扬张灵甫采用迂回战术，突破了我军防线，一举攻克涟水。在孟良崮，他又运用了声东击西的战术，把我军从战士到连长、团长、师长、军长全“蒙骗”了。影片以丑化我军的手法来反衬张灵甫的“英明果断”，真是恶毒之极！
    “碑文”说：张灵甫“英勇奋战，临死不惧”，“杀身成仁”。影片就吹嘘张灵甫在我军包围了孟良崮时还野心勃勃地要来个“中心开花”！在我军攻到敌指挥所时，他面不改色地说：“镇静点！”在只剩他一人时，仍从容不迫地戴上钢盔，抓起冲锋枪进行顽抗，最后成了“杀身成仁”的“英雄”。
    人民公敌蒋介石曾吹嘘说：“有七十四师就有国民党”，“有十个这样的师，就可以坐天下！”影片就竭尽全力把张灵甫打扮成“盖世英雄”，并通过影片中的张灵甫大喊：“这是一台好戏，我们是主角嘛！”“只有我们七十四师配当这个主角！”反动气焰嚣张到了极点！
    事实果真象蒋介石与他的崇拜者瞿白音描绘的那样吗？不！恰恰相反。正如毛主席所指出的：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”蒋介石和他的“王牌”七十四师，也就是这样的纸老虎。当时敌七十四师在我军接二连三的打击下，人员几乎死伤一半。张灵甫害怕得不敢去山东战场，几次要求伪国防部将七十四师调到南京“整训”，而且还编瞎话要求请假“养病”。在孟良崮战役中，就是这个被蒋匪和影片吹捧成“英勇奋战，临死不惧”的张灵甫，在我强大的解放军面前，吓得魂不附体，最先换上士兵衣服逃跑的。
    《红日》的编导者肆意歪曲历史事实，站在蒋介石的反革命立场上，按照蒋介石的黑话，歌颂了敌七十四师，塑造了张灵甫这个反革命的“英雄”。
    孟良崮战役至今已经二十年了，蒋介石为张灵甫树的石碑早已随着蒋家王朝的崩溃而被革命的车轮碾得粉碎。编导者捡起一些破砖烂瓦，重新为张灵甫树起“牌位”，目的何在？他们就是要配合蒋匪帮的“反攻大陆”叫嚣，梦想在中国实现反革命的复辟。
    蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。十八年前，我们全部、干净、彻底地消灭了大陆上八百万蒋匪军。十八年后，我们更有信心，更有力量消灭一切胆敢来犯的敌人！七亿中国人民严阵以待，几个残存的蒋匪军和它的招魂者瞿白音之流绝不会比蒋匪七十四师有更好的下场！
