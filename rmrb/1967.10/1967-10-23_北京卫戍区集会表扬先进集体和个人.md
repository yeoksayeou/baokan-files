Highly Praise the Advanced Collectives and Individuals in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" Work

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and amidst the nationwide wave of studying and implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Beijing Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a grand meeting on October 21 to commend 167 advanced collectives and 666 advanced individuals who have excelled in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks in Beijing. These outstanding soldiers and officers, with hearts filled with excitement, vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism," remain humble and vigilant, and further promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. They pledged to make the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work even better and achieve new victories for the people.

In January of this year, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "support the leftist masses." The soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison and the Beijing-based troops swiftly responded and rushed to the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks. They have consistently held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the highest, greatest, first, and most important position. They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together with the revolutionary masses in the midst of struggle. They helped the revolutionary masses use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the capitalist-roaders within the Party, criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and criticize bourgeois and all exploitative class ideologies. Many factories, schools, and rural areas established and maintained daily reading sessions, consulting Chairman Mao's works whenever problems arose; they held study sessions before and after classes, at work sites, in dormitories, and in the fields; they studied the "Three Articles," sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, held lectures and discussions, organized study classes, and vigorously promoted self-criticism and public-mindedness. They launched wave after wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the people, and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. In the sharp and complex class struggles of the Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, clearly distinguishing and supporting the leftists, expanding the ranks of the leftists. Together with the revolutionary leftists, they closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle, united with the broad revolutionary masses to carry out the great criticism, promote the great alliance, and the three-in-one combination. Currently, in 99% of the factories, mines, and enterprises where the support-left personnel are stationed, the great alliance has been achieved; in 98% of the schools undergoing military training, the great alliance has been achieved; nine districts and counties have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and more than 200 units have established temporary power organs of the three-in-one combination. The soldiers and officers of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policies of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "resume classes and carry out the revolution." Together with the broad masses of workers and peasants, they have vigorously promoted production while carrying out the revolution, greatly promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. The revolutionary teachers and students, after undergoing military training, have significantly improved in their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. They are currently resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, deeply implementing the struggle-criticism-reform in schools.

Among the more than 800 advanced collectives and individuals commended this time, there are those who led the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and achieved excellent results, such as the support-left personnel of the Beijing No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, the Wangzuo Commune of Fengtai District, the Guandao Commune of Fangshan County, the Shijingshan Middle School, and the 89th Military Training Team; those who firmly supported the revolutionary leftists and did excellent political and ideological work for the masses, such as the support-left personnel of the Beijing Water Supply Bureau, the Beijing Machine Tool Works, the Hehanzhai Commune of Miyun County, the Beijing Normal University, the 91st Middle School, and the Dongqiaozhuang No. 1 Middle School Military Training Team; those who carried out the great criticism with the revolutionary masses and achieved outstanding results, such as the support-left personnel of the Beijing Radio Factory, the Beijing Clothing Factory, the Yucun Commune of Daxing County, the 23rd Middle School, and the Yuejiazhuang Middle School Military Training Team; those who helped the broad revolutionary masses quickly achieve the great alliance and achieved remarkable results, such as the support-left personnel of the Beijing Wire Factory, the Automobile Repair Company, the Dayantan Middle School, the Peking University Affiliated Middle School, and the 64th Middle School Military Training Team; those who contributed to the quick achievement of the three-in-one combination in their units, such as the support-left personnel of the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, the People's Armed Forces Department of Pinggu County, the Pinggu County-based agricultural support troops, the No. 7 Girls' Middle School, and the 60th Middle School Military Training Team; those who achieved good results in "grasp revolution, promote production" and "resume classes and carry out the revolution," such as the support-left personnel of the Beijing Changgou Coal Mine, the Shiliuzhuang Production Brigade of the Nan Yuan Commune in Fengtai District, the Hanjia River Production Brigade of the Dongbeiwang Commune in Haidian District, the Grassland Middle School Military Training Company, and the Sujiatun Middle School Military Training Team; and those who, in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and effectively promoted their own thought revolution, such as the support-left personnel of the Minzu Hotel, the Beijing Instrument Factory, and the Bai Jia Zhuang Middle School Military Training Camp.

At the meeting, amid warm applause, the commander of the Beijing Garrison, Fu Chongbi, and the second political commissar, Huang Zuozhen, awarded certificates bearing the inscription of the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" to the advanced collectives and individuals.

Fu Chongbi and Huang Zuozhen, in their speeches, pointed out: All the achievements made in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work in Beijing are great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. These achievements should first be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, and to the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Cultural Revolution Group led by Chairman Mao. At the same time, they are the results of the leadership of the various departments of the People's Liberation Army and the Beijing-based troops, the support of various military branches, military academies, and the revolutionary masses of the three services and the revolutionary masses of Beijing. They are also the results of the joint efforts of all the soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries." They urged the soldiers and officers of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" to seriously study and deeply understand the extremely important instructions given by the great leader Chairman Mao during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China, and to resolutely implement them, word for word and sentence for sentence. They should closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key, further vigorously promote the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out the great criticism, implement the struggle-criticism-reform in their units, vigorously promote the revolution, and vigorously promote production. They should also promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new stage and a new level, turning each unit into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. They emphasized that in this unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation, we must see that the tasks ahead are still very arduous. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "support the army and love the people," maintain close military-civilian relations, be models of loving the people, be humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, constantly overcome shortcomings and errors in our work, and make the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work even better.

The representatives of the advanced collectives and individuals commended at the meeting unanimously expressed in their speeches: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and place the study and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. We must resolutely implement them, word for word and sentence for sentence. They also expressed their determination to be humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, constantly summarize experiences, promote achievements, correct shortcomings, and make the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work even better, achieving new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Senior leaders from various departments of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, various military branches, military academies, and the Beijing-based troops attended the meeting. (Accompanied by a photograph)
