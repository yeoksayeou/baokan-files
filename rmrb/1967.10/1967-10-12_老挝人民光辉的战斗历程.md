Today marks the 22nd anniversary of the Lao Revolution Day. The Chinese people warmly celebrate this glorious revolutionary holiday of the Lao people and extend militant greetings to the Lao people who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

For a long time, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people have been waging an unyielding struggle for national independence and liberation. The Lao people successfully waged a nine-year war against the French, and subsequently bravely persisted in a more than ten-year struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Twenty-two years of struggle have proven that the Lao people are indeed a heroic people.

Currently, the Lao people's anti-American national salvation war is presenting a very good situation. Two-thirds of Lao territory has already become the people's domain, and more than a million people have been liberated. The large-scale "sweeping" and "guerrilla" attacks by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have been repeatedly smashed, and a large number of their effective forces have been annihilated. In the first half of this year alone, more than 5,000 U.S. puppet soldiers were annihilated, and more than 180 U.S. aircraft were shot down. The great victories of the Lao people's anti-American national salvation war have powerfully struck at U.S. imperialism's plan to invade Indochina, directly supported the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war, and greatly encouraged the anti-American struggles of the people of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no revolutionary victory." The struggle of the Lao people has once again proven this great revolutionary truth pointed out by Chairman Mao.

Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people have established their own armed forces. This is the reliable guarantee for the continuous victories of the Lao people's liberation cause. It is precisely relying on this patriotic armed force that the Lao people won the victory in the anti-French war. After U.S. imperialism extended its claws of aggression into Laos, in order to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Lao people, it attempted to annihilate the Lao people's armed forces. However, the Lao people deeply understand that this armed force is the lifeline of the Lao people's revolutionary cause. With it, the revolution can achieve victory; with it, the fruits of revolutionary victory can be defended. At several critical moments, the Lao people repeatedly smashed the evil plans of U.S. imperialism to annihilate the Lao patriotic armed forces through conspiracies. It is precisely relying on this patriotic armed force that the Lao people have achieved a great situation.

In the long and arduous struggle, the Lao patriotic armed forces have continuously grown and strengthened, developing into a powerful people's army. This people's army, on the vast land of Laos, mobilizes the masses, especially the peasant masses, to participate in guerrilla warfare, laying a net to annihilate the enemy. Relying on this people's army, relying on the unity of all ethnic groups in Laos, and relying on the unity of patriotic forces from all sectors, the Lao Patriotic Front has continuously advanced the Lao national democratic revolution.

U.S. imperialism is vigorously strengthening the reactionary armed forces of its puppet regime and plotting to expand its war of aggression against Laos. However, this will not save it from failure in Laos. In the anti-American national salvation war, the Lao people have adopted the strategy of a protracted war. The Lao patriotic armed forces, using the strategy and tactics of people's war, annihilate the enemy in parts, eating them up bit by bit. By persisting in this way continuously, accumulating small victories into great victories, the balance of power between the enemy and us can be fundamentally changed, and the liberated areas can be gradually expanded, ultimately defeating U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and liberating all of Laos.

Currently, we are in a new era of world revolution. The revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are deepening. U.S. imperialism is surrounded on all sides, struggling to cope, and is accelerating its path to destruction. Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. All oppressed nations and peoples, as long as they dare to take up arms and fight, will definitely be able to defeat the ferocious U.S. imperialism and achieve great victories in national liberation. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has proven this, and the heroic struggle of the Lao people has also proven this.

The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Lao people as their own struggle and the victory of the Lao people as their own victory. In the Lao people's anti-American national salvation war, 700 million Chinese people are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Lao people. The Chinese people will resolutely and wholeheartedly support the Lao people to fight on, to fight to the end, until they achieve the final victory in the anti-American national salvation war.

　　老挝人民光辉的战斗历程
　　本报评论员
    今天是老挝革命节二十二周年纪念日。中国人民热烈祝贺老挝人民这个光辉的革命节日，并向正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行英勇斗争的老挝人民致以战斗的敬礼。
    长期以来，老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，为争取祖国独立和民族解放进行着不屈不挠的斗争。老挝人民胜利地进行了九年的抗法战争，随后又英勇地坚持了十多年反对美帝国主义及其走狗的战斗。二十二年的斗争历史证明，老挝人民不愧是英雄的人民。
    目前，老挝人民的抗美救国战争呈现出一片大好形势。老挝三分之二的土地已经成了人民的天下，一百万以上的人口已经得到了解放。美帝国主义及其走狗的大规模“扫荡”和“蚕食”进攻不断被粉碎，有生力量大量被消灭。今年上半年，就有五千多名美伪军被歼灭，一百八十多架美国飞机被击毁。老挝人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，有力地打击了美帝国主义在印度支那的侵略计划，直接支援了兄弟越南人民的抗美救国战争，并且大大鼓舞了世界人民的反美斗争。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”老挝人民的斗争实践，再一次证明了毛主席指出的这个伟大的革命真理。
    在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，老挝人民建立了自己的武装力量。这是老挝人民解放事业不断取得胜利的可靠保证。正是依靠这支爱国武装力量，老挝人民取得了抗法战争的胜利。美帝国主义把侵略魔爪伸进老挝以后，为了扑灭老挝人民的革命烈火，力图消灭老挝人民的武装力量。但是，老挝人民深深懂得，这支武装力量是老挝人民革命事业的命根子。有了它，革命就能够取得胜利；有了它，革命的胜利果实才能得到保卫。在几个关键性的时刻，老挝人民多次粉碎了美帝国主义用阴谋手法企图消灭老挝爱国武装力量的罪恶计划。老挝人民正是依靠了这支爱国武装力量，打出了一个大好局面。
    在长期艰苦的战斗中，老挝爱国武装力量不断成长壮大，已经发展成为一支强大的人民军队。这支人民军队在老挝广阔的土地上，发动群众，尤其是农民群众参加游击战争，布下了消灭敌人的天罗地网。老挝爱国战线党依靠这支人民军队，依靠老挝各民族的团结一致，依靠广泛阶层的爱国力量的团结一致，把老挝民族民主革命不断地推向前进。
    美帝国主义正在大力加强傀儡集团的反革命武装力量，策划扩大对老挝的侵略战争。但是，这决不能挽救它在老挝的失败。老挝人民在抗美救国战争中，采取了持久战的方针。老挝爱国武装力量运用人民战争的战略战术，把敌人一部分、一部分地消灭，一口一口地吃掉。这样长期坚持，连续下去，积小胜为大胜，就能根本改变敌我力量的对比，一步一步地扩大解放区，最后彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗，解放全老挝。
    当前正处于世界革命的一个新时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命斗争正在深入发展。美帝国主义四面楚歌，穷于应付，正在加速走向灭亡。帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，只要敢于拿起枪杆子进行斗争，就一定能够打败凶恶的美帝国主义，取得民族解放的伟大胜利。越南人民的英勇斗争证明了这一点，老挝人民的英勇斗争也证明了这一点。
    中国人民一贯把老挝人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把老挝人民的胜利看作是自己的胜利。在老挝人民抗美救国战争中，七亿中国人民誓作老挝人民的坚强后盾。中国人民坚定不移地全力支援老挝人民打下去，打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
