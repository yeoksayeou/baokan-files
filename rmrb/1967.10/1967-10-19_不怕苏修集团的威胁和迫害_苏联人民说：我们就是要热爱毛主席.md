	Not fearing the threats and persecution by the Soviet revisionist clique, the Soviet people say: We will always love Chairman Mao!

	According to Xinhua News Agency, just as the billion people of our country are joyfully celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China under the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the Soviet people under the dark rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, undaunted by threats and persecution, find various ways and through various forms to express their warm congratulations to Chinese comrades on the festival, especially expressing their boundless love for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, in the most sincere and enthusiastic language.

	On the morning of September 27, just before the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a young Soviet citizen handed a piece of white paper to a Chinese comrade on a street in Moscow. On the paper, written neatly in red ink, were the words: "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!"

	The young man then quietly lifted his collar to show the Chinese comrade a gold-plated Mao badge pinned to his inner clothing.

	He firmly grasped the Chinese comrade's hand and, in a slow but resolute tone, said, "We will always be your friends, Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong!"

	These brief words profoundly indicate that the Soviet revisionists' attempts to destroy the deep feelings of the Soviet people for the Chinese people and the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, are utterly futile.

	A couple proudly wore gold-plated Mao badges on their chests. When the Soviet revisionist spies discovered this, they were terrified and enraged, repeatedly threatening the couple and forcing them to remove the badges. However, as soon as the spies left, the couple took out the Mao badges again and reverently pinned them to their chests. They tightly grasped the hands of the Chinese comrade who had given them the badges and, with each word clearly enunciated, firmly declared, "We will always love Chairman Mao!"

	In a public bus in Moscow, a middle-aged Soviet citizen saw Chinese students wearing Mao badges. He secretly gave them a thumbs up and, in a low but deeply respectful voice, said, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" After a while, he avoided the gaze of the people around him, showing a look of envy, and pointed to the badge, then to his chest. The Chinese students understood his intentions and took off the badge to give it to him. He took the badge in his hand, caressed it with deep affection, and couldn't bear to let it go. Then he carefully put it in his pocket and, with excited gestures, pointed to his heart, indicating that he was deeply moved.

　　不怕苏修集团的威胁和迫害
    苏联人民说：我们就是要热爱毛主席
    据新华社讯　正当我国亿万人民在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，喜气洋洋地欢庆中华人民共和国成立十八周年的时候，在苏修领导集团黑暗统治下的苏联人民不怕威胁和迫害，想出各种办法，通过各种形式向中国同志热烈表示节日的祝贺，特别是以极其真挚热情的语言表达他们对世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    九月二十七日上午，正当中华人民共和国成立十八周年的节日即将到来的前夕，一位苏联青年在莫斯科的大街上向一位中国同志的手中塞了一张白纸条，上面用红颜色的笔端端正正地写着：“毛泽东同志万岁！”
    这位青年人轻轻地对着中国同志掀开自己的衣领，在他的内衣上佩戴着一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章。
    他紧握着中国同志的手，用缓慢而又坚决的音调对中国同志说：“我们永远是你们的朋友，列宁、斯大林、毛泽东！”
    这简短的两句话深刻地表明，苏修企图破坏苏联人民对中国人民和当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的深厚感情是无论如何也办不到的。
    有一对夫妇在胸前骄傲地佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章。苏修特务发现了这件事，怕得要死，恨得要命，再三威胁这对夫妇，强迫他们把像章摘下来。但是，当苏修特务一离开，这对夫妇就又把毛主席像章拿出，恭恭敬敬地佩戴在胸前。他们紧紧地握住赠送像章给他们的中国同志的双手，一字一句斩钉截铁地说：“我们就是要热爱毛主席！”
    一位中年的苏联人在莫斯科的公共汽车上，见到中国留学生佩戴着毛主席像章，暗暗地伸出大拇指，低声地但是无比崇敬地对他们说：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”过了一会，他避开周围人的视线，露出羡慕的神色，用手指指像章，又指指自己的胸脯。中国学生完全领会了他的心意，便把像章取下来赠给他。他接过像章放在手心里，无限深情地抚摸又抚摸，爱不释手，然后又小心翼翼地放进了怀里，并且兴奋地做着手势，指着自己的心窝，表示心情十分激动。
