Tirana Celebrates the Glorious Anniversary of the Chinese People

Pachrami Says the Brilliant Victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution Delights the World's People

Wang Shusheng Says the Albanian People's Revolutionization Movement Makes a Valuable Contribution to the Development of the Socialist Revolution

Tirana, 29th - According to Xinhua News Agency, over a thousand representatives from various sectors of Albania's capital, Tirana, gathered in the Tirana Cultural Palace on the afternoon of the 28th to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in the most enthusiastic manner.

The celebration was jointly organized by the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association and the Albanian Foreign Cultural Commission.

Among the attendees were: Kadare, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and a Central Committee Secretary; Muftiu, a member of the Political Bureau and the First Secretary of the Tirana Party Committee; Kellezi, an alternate member of the Political Bureau, Chairman of the Tirana People's Assembly Executive Committee, and Chairman of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, as well as several other Central Committee members and alternate members.

The delegation from the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, led by Wang Shusheng, Deputy Minister of Defense, and the Chinese Scientific Workers' Delegation were invited to attend the celebration.

Also present were Li Tingquan, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, other diplomatic staff, and Chinese technical personnel working in Albania.

The venue was decorated solemnly and grandly. On the stage were large portraits of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, the national flags of the two countries, and a large banner reading "Long Live the People's Republic of China!"

When Kadare, Muftiu, Kellezi, and other comrades, along with the entire delegation of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association and the Chinese Scientific Workers' Delegation, entered the venue, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause. Shouts of "Enver-Mao Zedong!" "People's China!" and "Friendship is the guarantee!" echoed endlessly.

The celebration was chaired by Kellezi, Chairman of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association. Pachrami, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Wang Shusheng, the head of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association delegation, spoke at the meeting.

Pachrami said that the Albanian people celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China as if it were their own national holiday. This is because the victory of the socialist revolution in China plays a decisive role in the fate of humanity and revolution. Because Mao Zedong's China today has become a powerful bastion and standard-bearer of world revolution and socialism. Because the Albanian people have forged a fraternal friendship with the great Chinese people.

Pachrami pointed out that China today is stronger than ever. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has overcome all difficulties and obstacles and is advancing towards victory. The banner of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and revolution, today flying high in China under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will stand firm and guide the Chinese people to even greater victories, its brilliance shining across the world.

Pachrami pointed out that the victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past year are brilliant, bringing joy to the Chinese people and their friends around the world, especially to the Albanian people, because China's victory is also our victory.

He pointed out that since the Khrushchev revisionist traitor clique seized the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by Lenin, the Communist Party of China began the struggle to expose and smash modern revisionism. At the same time, the Communist Party of China bravely launched a struggle against the revisionist currents within the party, which attempted to drag it towards the revisionist path and restore capitalism in China. The significance of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and its historic decisions lies in this.

Mao Zedong's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" exposed the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the party and the organs of proletarian dictatorship, led by China's Khrushchev. The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," formulated under the direct leadership of Mao Zedong, is a great victory of the revolutionary line over revisionism. It establishes the line, principles, and methods for conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointing the way to carry the socialist revolution through to the end and to the transition from socialism to communism.

One year later, the great significance of this decision is clear. Revolutionaries around the world cheer the great victories achieved by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year. This victory's historical significance has already surpassed the borders of China. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the victory of Marxism-Leninism over revisionism, the victory of revolution over counter-revolution, and the victory of socialism over capitalism.

He pointed out that the victory of the Chinese people and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has frightened the imperialists and modern revisionists. Their hopes have been dashed; People's China will not change color, but rather, it is strengthening its redness.

He said, the People's Republic of China today is a great world power. The seven hundred million Chinese people today play a decisive role everywhere. The People's Republic of China has become an insurmountable obstacle for the imperialists and has gained immense prestige in the world.

Pachrami then spoke about the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression. He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people is fully supported by the great Chinese people in the spirit of internationalism. In Vietnam, American imperialism is facing true collapse. The Khrushchev revisionists led by Brezhnev-Kosygin are stabbing the Vietnamese people in the back, futilely attempting to rescue American imperialism from inevitable doom. This is another betrayal by the Soviet revisionists.

Pachrami concluded by saying that what binds the peoples of Albania and China, the two Marxist-Leninist parties, and the two countries is a deep, sincere, and fraternal friendship. Today, our two Marxist-Leninist parties and our two peoples, led by our leaders Hoxha and Mao Zedong, stand at the forefront of the revolutionary and national liberation struggle, at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. In this great cause for the peoples of all countries, for the victory of socialism and Marxism-Leninism over imperialism and modern revisionism, our friendship is growing stronger every day.

Wang Shusheng, the head of the Chinese-Albanian Friendship Association delegation, first expressed the highest proletarian respect and warmest greetings to the Albanian Labor Party, government, and people, and to Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade of the Chinese people.

Wang Shusheng said that over the past eighteen years, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, have achieved great victories in their struggles against domestic and foreign class enemies and in their socialist revolution and socialist construction.

He went on to point out that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, has, after more than a year of vigorous mass movement, achieved decisive and historic great victories. Both revolution and production are in an unprecedentedly good situation.

Wang Shusheng pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has exposed China's Khrushchev and the clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and has smashed their counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Their counter-revolutionary line has completely collapsed, and their plot to restore capitalism has been smashed. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the proletariat over the bourgeoisie's restoration, and a great victory for the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Wang Shusheng enthusiastically praised the high revolutionary spirit and heroic spirit of the Albanian people in firmly opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

Wang Shusheng said that the series of revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian Labor Party have consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, promoted the revolutionary transformation of the broad masses, and made a valuable contribution to the development of the socialist revolution and the prevention of capitalist restoration. These revolutionary measures are another brilliant example of the Albanian Labor Party's creative application of Marxism-Leninism to the socialist revolution in their own country.

He said that recently, Comrade Hoxha has put forward new great fighting tasks for the people of the whole country at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front. We believe that the heroic Albanian people will, under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Hoxha, advance from victory to victory. The Albanian people are a people who dare to struggle and dare to win; the Albanian Labor Party is a glorious, Marxist-Leninist party; the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, is a great communist warrior who has stood the test of time, an outstanding Marxist-Leninist.

Wang Shusheng concluded by saying that our friendship is a true proletarian class friendship, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, forged by the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Hoxha. In the future, no matter what storms or tempests we encounter on our path forward, our two peoples will always stand together, fight together, and win together.

The speeches by Pachrami and Wang Shusheng were repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause. Shouts of "Enver-Mao Zedong!" "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" "People's China!" and "Friendship is the guarantee!" echoed throughout the venue.

After the celebration, the Albanian National Ballet performed the Chinese revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," which was enthusiastically received by the attendees.

    地拉那盛会热烈庆祝中国人民的光辉节日
    帕奇拉米说中国文化大革命的辉煌胜利使全世界人民欢欣鼓舞  王树声说阿人民革命化运动为发展社会主义革命作出宝贵贡献
    据新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那各界代表一千多人，二十八日下午在地拉那文化宫隆重集会，最热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    庆祝大会是由阿中友协和阿尔巴尼亚对外文委联合举办的。
    出席庆祝大会的有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、中央书记卡博，政治局委员、地拉那党委第一书记穆夫蒂乌，政治局候补委员、地拉那人民会议执行委员会主席、阿中友协主席凯莱齐，以及一些中央委员和候补中央委员等。
    由中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声率领的中阿友协代表团以及中国科学工作者代表团，应邀出席了庆祝大会。
    出席庆祝大会的还有中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃和大使馆其他外交人员、在阿尔巴尼亚工作的中国技术人员等。
    大会会场布置得十分庄严、隆重。主席台上悬挂着中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的巨幅画像、中阿两国国旗，以及“中华人民共和国万岁！”的巨幅标语。
    当卡博、穆夫蒂乌、凯莱齐等同志和中阿友协代表团、中国科学工作者代表团全体成员步入会场的时候，全场爆发出暴风雨般的掌声，“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”“友谊就是保证！”的欢呼声经久不息。
    庆祝大会由阿中友协主席凯莱齐主持。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员帕奇拉米和中阿友协代表团团长王树声先后在会上讲话。
    帕奇拉米说，阿尔巴尼亚人民象庆祝自己的节日一样庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年，因为社会主义革命在中国的胜利对人类和革命的命运起着决定性的作用，因为毛泽东的人民中国今天已经成为世界革命和社会主义的强大堡垒和旗手，因为阿尔巴尼亚人民同伟大的中国人民结成了兄弟般的友谊。
    帕奇拉米指出，人民中国今天比以往任何时候都强大。无产阶级文化大革命越过了一切困难和障碍在胜利前进。马克思列宁主义、社会主义和革命的旗帜，今天在中国高高飘扬的毛泽东思想的旗帜，将巍然屹立，将引导中国人民走向更加伟大的新的胜利，其光辉将照遍全世界。
    帕奇拉米指出，一年来中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的胜利是辉煌的，它使中国人民及其在世界上的朋友感到高兴，我们阿尔巴尼亚人尤其感到高兴，因为中国的胜利也就是我们的胜利。
    他指出，自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团篡夺了由列宁缔造的苏联共产党的领导权以后，中国共产党开始了揭露和粉碎现代修正主义的斗争。同时，中国共产党勇敢地展开了斗争，反对在党内产生的、企图把她拉向修正主义道路并在中国复辟资本主义的修正主义暗流。中共八届十一中全会及其历史性决定的重要意义就在于此。
    毛泽东同志写的《炮打司令部》的大字报，揭露了隐藏在党内和无产阶级专政机构内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。在毛泽东同志的直接领导下制订的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，是革命路线对修正主义的巨大胜利，它确定了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的路线、方针和方法，指出了把社会主义革命进行到底以及从社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路。
    一年以后的现在，清楚地看到了这个决定的伟大意义。全世界的革命者都欢呼中国共产党和中国人民一年来在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大胜利，因为这一胜利的历史意义已经超越了中国国界，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义对修正主义的胜利，是革命对反革命的胜利，是社会主义对资本主义的胜利。
    他指出，中国人民和中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利吓坏了帝国主义者和现代修正主义者。他们的希望破产了，人民中国不会改变颜色，相反，正在加强她的红色。
    他说，中华人民共和国今天是伟大的世界强国。七亿中国人民今天在任何地方都起着决定性作用。中华人民共和国已经成了帝国主义者不可逾越的障碍，并在世界上赢得了巨大的威望。
    帕奇拉米接着谈到了越南人民抗美救国的英勇斗争。他说，越南人民的斗争得到伟大中国人民国际主义的全面支持。在越南，美帝国主义面临着真正的崩溃。以勃列日涅夫—柯西金为首的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在越南人民背后插上尖刀，徒劳地企图把美帝国主义从必然的覆灭中挽救出来。这是苏联修正主义者的又一个叛卖。
    帕奇拉米最后说，连结阿中两国人民、两个马克思列宁主义党和两国的，是深厚的、真挚的和兄弟般的友谊。我们阿中两个马克思列宁主义党以及在我们两国领袖霍查同志和毛泽东同志领导下的我们两国人民，今天站在革命和民族解放斗争的前列，站在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争的前列。在这一为了各国人民的伟大事业，为了社会主义和马克思列宁主义对帝国主义和现代修正主义的胜利的斗争中，我们的友谊正在日益增强。
    中阿友协代表团团长王树声在讲话中首先代表中国人民，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、政府和人民，向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的战友霍查同志，致以无产阶级最崇高的敬意和最亲切的问候。
    王树声说，十八年来，中国人民在伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在同国内外阶级敌人的斗争中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中都取得了伟大的胜利。
    他接着指出，史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，经过了一年多的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，已经取得了具有历史意义的决定性的伟大胜利。革命和生产，都是一片空前大好形势。
    王树声指出，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫，和以他为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，摧毁了他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线。他们的反革命阵线全面崩溃了，他们复辟资本主义的阴谋被粉碎了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是无产阶级反资产阶级复辟的伟大胜利，这是巩固无产阶级专政的伟大胜利。
    王树声热情赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的高度革命精神和英雄气概。
    王树声说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党采取的一系列革命化措施，巩固了无产阶级专政，促进了广大人民的思想革命化，对于发展社会主义革命和防止资本主义复辟作出了宝贵的贡献。这些革命化措施，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用于本国社会主义革命的又一个光辉范例。
    他说，最近，霍查同志又在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上向全国人民提出了新的伟大的战斗任务。我们相信，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民将沿着伟大领袖霍查同志所指引的道路，从胜利走向胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民是敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄的人民；阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是光荣的、马克思列宁主义的党；阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志是久经考验的伟大的共产主义战士，杰出的马克思列宁主义者。
    王树声最后说，我们之间的友谊，是真正的无产阶级的阶级友谊，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，是以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党共同锤炼的。今后，不论在我们前进的道路上遇到什么样的惊涛骇浪，什么样的暴风骤雨，我们两国人民都永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    帕奇拉米和王树声的讲话不断为暴风雨般的掌声所打断，“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“毛泽东同志万岁！”“人民中国！”“友谊就是保证！”的欢呼声响彻全场。
    庆祝大会结束后，阿尔巴尼亚国家芭蕾舞剧院演出了中国革命芭蕾舞《红色娘子军》，受到与会者十分热烈的欢迎。
