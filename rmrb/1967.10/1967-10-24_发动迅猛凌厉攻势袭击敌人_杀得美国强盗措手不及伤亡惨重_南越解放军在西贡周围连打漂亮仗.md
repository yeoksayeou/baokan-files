The liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have continued to attack the enemy in the so-called "key pacification" areas around Saigon, inflicting heavy casualties and significant losses on the enemy.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces in the northern part of Go Vap District, Gia Dinh Province, the southern part of Tra Vinh District, West Ninh Province, and the western part of Ben Cat District, Thu Dau Mot Province, have, from September 17 to 27 over a period of eleven days, smashed a large-scale "sweep" by three battalions of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, killing more than 600 enemy soldiers, the vast majority of whom were American invaders.

On September 20 alone, the liberation armed forces killed 150 American invaders. In this battle, the liberation armed forces also shot down 20 enemy aircraft, destroyed 19 armored vehicles, and 4 cannons.

On October 2, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on the puppet forces stationed in the southwestern region of Chau Duc District, Thu Dau Mot Province. After a short battle, they annihilated an entire battalion of the puppet 5th Division, completely eliminating the battalion commander and American "advisors," capturing 20 puppet soldiers, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on October 22, the brave and skilled South Vietnamese liberation armed forces fought a brilliant ambush battle on October 17, about 60 kilometers north of Saigon, annihilating approximately 120 American invaders from the 1st Infantry Division. An American brigadier general and two colonels were killed on the spot, and two company commanders were wounded.

According to Western news agencies, in the intense battle that lasted a day, the liberation armed forces launched a swift and fierce attack on the enemy, catching the American aggressors off guard and inflicting heavy casualties. At dawn on October 18, the U.S. military authorities hastily dispatched a battalion of American troops to the battlefield to search for the main force of the liberation armed forces, but the liberation armed forces had already safely withdrawn, leaving the enemy empty-handed.
