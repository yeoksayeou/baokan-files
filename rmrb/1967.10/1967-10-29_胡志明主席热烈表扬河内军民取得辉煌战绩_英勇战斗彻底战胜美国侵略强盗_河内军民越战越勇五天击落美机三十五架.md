Chairman Ho Chi Minh on October 27 wrote a letter to the heroic military and civilians of Hanoi, warmly praising them for their brilliant achievements in the past four days of continuous repelling multiple attacks by American air bandits, shooting down 30 enemy planes and capturing a large number of American air pirates.

In his letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the American bandits, in their desperation, have resorted to various brutal tactics in an attempt to extricate themselves from their predicament. However, the more crimes they commit, the more hatred the Vietnamese military and civilians harbor towards them, and the more determined they are to defeat them.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh encouraged the military and civilians of Hanoi to always stay vigilant, unite closely, fight bravely, intelligently, and tenaciously, and together with the military and civilians of the entire country, continue to advance bravely, resolutely and thoroughly defeat the American invaders.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, October 27: The General Command of the People's Army of Vietnam issued a statement on October 26, warmly praising the heroic military and civilians of Hanoi for their brilliant victories in shooting down 23 invading American bandit planes and capturing many American air pirates in the city and suburbs of Hanoi over three days from October 24 to 26.

The statement pointed out that this brilliant victory is the result of the military and civilians of Hanoi's active offensive spirit, close cooperation, and brave and intelligent fighting.

The statement pointed out that the American bandits' new "escalation" of the war is merely a criminal and reckless act carried out when they are in a situation of military and political failure, isolation, and having no way out. However, no matter how brutal the tactics of the American bandits, they cannot save their predicament; no matter how many bombs the American bandits drop, they cannot suppress the Vietnamese people's will to fight to the end; no matter how cunning the plots and words of the American bandits, they cannot deceive the Vietnamese military and civilians.

The statement said that for every crime committed by the American bandits, the military and civilians of South and North Vietnam will resolutely give them fivefold or tenfold punishment.

The statement called on the military and civilians of Hanoi, together with the military and civilians of the entire country, to vigorously carry forward the offensive spirit, resolutely smash all the aggressive plots and actions of the American bandits, and carry the anti-American national salvation war to a thorough victory.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, October 28: On October 28, American bandit planes continued their fifth day of savage attacks on the city and suburbs of Hanoi. The military and civilians of Hanoi, fighting more bravely each day, fiercely opened fire on the American air bandits, shooting down five American bandit planes in just a few minutes and capturing many American air pirates.

On October 27, the military and civilians of Hanoi shot down a total of seven American bandit planes. In addition to the six already reported, another American bandit plane was shot down in the evening of the same day.

Thus, from October 24 to 28, the military and civilians of Hanoi achieved victory in every battle, shooting down 35 American bandit planes and capturing a large number of American air pirates, giving a severe punishment to the American bandits who are frantically escalating the war.

    胡主席在信中指出，美国强盗在走投无路的时候，玩弄了各种残暴的手段，妄图摆脱窘境。但是，它制造的罪行越多，越南军民就越仇恨它，越决心战胜它。
    胡主席勉励河内军民必须时刻提高警惕，紧密团结，勇敢机智、坚韧不拔地战斗，同全国军民一道，继续英勇前进，坚决彻底地战胜美国侵略强盗。

    公报指出，这次辉煌的胜利是河内军民发扬积极进攻精神，紧密协作，勇敢机智地进行战斗的结果。
    公报指出，美国强盗的新的战争“升级”，只不过是它在军事和政治上都陷于失败、孤立和没有出路的处境的时候所进行的罪恶滔天的冒险行动而已。但是，美国强盗的任何残暴手段，都挽救不了它的困境；美国强盗的任何炸弹，都压制不了越南人民决战决胜的意志；美国强盗的任何狡诈的阴谋和言词，都骗不了越南军民。
    公报说，美国强盗制造一次罪恶，越南南北两方军民就坚决给予它五倍、十倍的惩罚。
    公报号召河内军民同全国军民一道，大力发扬进攻精神，坚决粉碎美国强盗的一切侵略阴谋和行动，把抗美救国战争进行到彻底胜利。
    新华社河内二十八日电　美国强盗飞机二十八日接连第五天野蛮袭击河内市区和郊区。河内市军民越战越勇，猛烈地向美国空中强盗开火，在短短的几分钟内就击落美国强盗飞机五架，活捉美国飞贼多名。
    二十七日，河内军民共击落美国强盗飞机七架。除已经报道的六架外，当天傍晚还击落了另一架美国强盗飞机。
    这样，从二十四到二十八日的五天中，河内市军民连战皆捷，把三十五架美国强盗飞机打得粉身碎骨，并活捉一大批美国飞贼，给了疯狂进行战争“升级”的美国强盗以严厉的惩罚。
