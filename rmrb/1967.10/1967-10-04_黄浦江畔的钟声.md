On the eve of celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the nation, the majestic clock tower of the Shanghai Customs House was adorned with bright lights like pearls, and the giant clock face shone brightly, with the hour hand pointing to midnight. A new day began, and the resonant bell rang out:

"In the East is red,
The sun is rising,
China has given birth to a Mao Zedong,
..."

This solemn and resonant bell tolling echoed and reverberated in the sky over Shanghai, constantly arousing the revolutionary fervor of the people of Shanghai, constantly arousing the people of Shanghai's boundless reverence and longing for the great leader Chairman Mao. The hearts of ten million revolutionary people of Shanghai soared with the bell, flying, flying, flying to the side of our great leader.

The bell also constantly calls on people to recall the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In late August 1966, under the support of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Red Guard movement flourished in Shanghai. The broad revolutionary youth brandished the "thousand-catty club" of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a total attack on bourgeois ideology and all exploitative class ideologies. The revolutionary waves surged through every corner of Shanghai, and also surged into the Shanghai Customs House. Batch after batch of revolutionary youth pasted big-character posters at the entrance of the Shanghai Customs House building. The big-character posters read:

"The bell of the Customs House is still the ghostly sound left over from the period of imperialist colonial rule. We must resolutely and thoroughly eradicate it, so that it will never rise again."

"We propose changing the bell of the Customs House to the melody of 'The East Is Red,' so that this epoch-making sound will resound in the sky over the motherland forever."

The big-character posters expressed the voice of the hearts of ten million revolutionary people of Shanghai. For more than ten years, Comrade Ke Qing Shi, a good student of Chairman Mao, had led the people of Shanghai to build a new socialist Shanghai under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. However, a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Shanghai Party, following the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, always dreamed of dragging socialist Shanghai onto the capitalist road. For this purpose, they tried every means to preserve the muddy waters left by imperialism and capitalism in Shanghai. They also kept the decayed melody of the Shanghai Customs House bell, attempting to use the eerie sounds composed by British gentlemen to summon the spirits of their capitalist dreams.

The people of Shanghai had long been disgusted with this ghostly howling. When the revolutionary youth of the Red Guards, riding the east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rose up to cleanse these muddy waters, they immediately received the support of the revolutionary staff of the Shanghai Customs House and the revolutionary workers of the whole city, and caused a strong reaction in society. The revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Beigao (now renamed Dongfanghong) Bell Factory were the first to take on the glorious task of modifying the Shanghai Customs House bell. They had once made a large bell for Beijing Railway Station. This time they said: "We must definitely pull out the capitalist and imperialist poisonous fangs of the Customs House bell, and let the praises of 'The East Is Red' resound throughout Shanghai." Then, the revolutionary staff of two radio factories in Shanghai, the revolutionary staff of the Shanghai Musical Instrument Factory, and the revolutionary youth of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music voluntarily signed up to participate in the work of modifying the Shanghai Customs House bell. With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary workers and youth of Shanghai, after three days of hard work, made the melody of "The East Is Red" resound throughout Shanghai. From then on, the Shanghai Customs House bell rang out a new sound.

The revolutionary bell inspired the people of Shanghai to break with the old and establish the new. The revolutionary people are thoroughly cleansing the influence of the capitalist and imperialist demons left in Shanghai, arming their minds with the great thought of Mao Zedong. In the bell's tolling, a January revolutionary red storm swept through, and the revolutionary people seized power from a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and established their own red power—the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. In the bell's tolling, a high tide of revolutionary criticism surged, and the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai are heading towards complete bankruptcy under the revolutionary masses' denunciation and criticism.

Today, whenever the people of Shanghai hear this bell, they will feel that this is the victory of the proletariat in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and they will think of the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year.

Listen, the bell rings again:

"In the East is red,
The sun is rising,
China has given birth to a Mao Zedong,
..."

In the song of praise, Shanghai, like a red-maned steed, gallops forward, stirring up a revolutionary whirlwind and sparks of victory. Good news! Good news! Eleven colleges and universities in Shanghai overnight leveled the "mountains" and achieved revolutionary great unity, 83% of Shanghai's factories and enterprises achieved revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination." Ten million people of Shanghai are following Chairman Mao's latest instructions to seize new victories. Good news! Good news! Along the Huangpu River, good news flies; on Nanjing Road, drums and gongs resound. Human tides surge from all directions towards the Bund, towards the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, letting the news of victory quickly reach Beijing and report to our beloved Chairman Mao.

The bell of the Huangpu River resonates powerfully, as if even the Bund has become more beautiful. Shanghai is the domain of the Chinese people, the domain of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries. Ten million people of Shanghai have overthrown the handful of capitalism-roaders within the Shanghai Party who obstructed their progress. Shanghai, like a high-speed motorboat, is advancing victoriously along the course opened by Chairman Mao!

The bell of the Huangpu River tolls.

This solemn and resonant bell tolling echoes and reverberates... It proclaims to the nation and the world: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved great victory in Shanghai. It will forever inspire ten million people of Shanghai to march forward! March forward!!

    黄浦江畔的钟声
　　胡万春
    在欢庆建国十八周年的国庆前夕，江海关巍峨的大钟楼镶上了明珠似的彩灯，那巨大的钟面闪闪发光，时针正指向午夜零点，新的一天开始了，那洪亮的钟声敲响了：
    “东方红，
    太阳升，
    中国出了个毛泽东，
    ……”
    这庄严、洪亮的钟声，在上海的上空回响着，震荡着，时刻在唤起上海人民革命的激情，时刻在唤起上海人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限崇敬和向往。一千万上海革命人民的心，随着钟声飞呀，飞呀，飞到我们伟大领袖身边去了。
    钟声也时刻在唤起人们对无产阶级文化大革命的回顾。一九六六年八月下旬，在我们伟大领袖毛主席支持下，红卫兵运动在上海蓬勃兴起。广大的革命小将抡起毛泽东思想的“千钧棒”，向资产阶级思想和一切剥削阶级思想发动了总攻击。革命的巨浪冲击着上海的每个角落，也冲击了上海江海关。一批又一批的革命小将，把大字报贴到江海关大楼门口。大字报上写着：
      “海关大楼现在的钟声，还是帝国主义殖民统治时期遗留下来的鬼怪声，我们要坚决彻底铲除它，让它永世不得翻身。”
    “建议把海关钟声改为《东方红》乐曲声，让这划时代的声音，时刻回响在祖国的上空。”
    大字报道出了上海市一千万革命人民的心声。十几年来，毛主席的好学生柯庆施同志，在上海高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，领导上海人民日新月异地建设着社会主义的新上海。但是，上海党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，时刻梦想把社会主义的上海拉到资本主义的道路上去。为了这个目的，他们千方百计地保存帝国主义、资本主义遗留在上海的污泥浊水。他们把江海关大钟的腐朽乐曲也保留了下来，企图用大不列颠绅士们谱写的阴阳怪气的音响，为他们梦幻中的资本主义招魂。
    上海人民早就十分厌恶这鬼怪般的嚎叫了。当红卫兵小将们乘着无产阶级文化大革命的东风，起来荡涤这些污泥浊水的时候，立刻受到了江海关革命职工和全市革命工人的支持，在社会上引起了强烈的反响。上海倍高（现改名东方红）钟厂的革命工人首先出来承担改装海关大钟的光荣任务。他们曾为北京火车站制造过大钟。这一次他们说：“我们一定要拔掉海关大钟的资本主义、帝国主义的毒牙，让《东方红》的颂歌响遍全上海。”接着，上海的两家无线电厂、上海乐器厂的革命职工和上海音乐学院的革命小将自动报名参加改装江海关大钟的工作。上海的革命工人和革命小将，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的激情，经过三天的奋战，就使《东方红》的乐曲响遍了上海的上空。从此，江海关大钟响起了新的钟声。
    革命的钟声激励着上海人民破旧立新。革命人民正在彻底肃清资本主义、帝国主义的妖魔鬼怪残留在上海的影响，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。钟声中，掀起了一月革命的红色风暴，革命人民从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手中夺回了大权，建立了自己的红色政权——上海市革命委员会。钟声中，掀起了革命大批判的高潮，中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人，正在革命群众的口诛笔伐中走向彻底的破产。
    今天，上海人民只要一听到这钟声，就会感到这是无产阶级在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的胜利，就会想到一年来无产阶级文化大革命的巨大收获。
    听吧，钟声又响了：
    “东方红，
    太阳升，
    中国出了个毛泽东，
    ……”
    在颂歌声中，上海象一匹红鬃烈马向前驰奔，卷起了革命的旋风和胜利的火花。喜报！喜报！上海十一所高等院校一夜间削平“山头”实现了革命的大联合，上海百分之八十三的工厂企业实现了革命的大联合、“三结合”，一千万上海人民正按毛主席的最新指示去夺取新的胜利。喜报！喜报！黄浦江畔，喜报纷飞；南京路上，锣鼓喧天。人的潮流，从四面八方涌向外滩，涌向上海市革命委员会，让胜利的消息快快传向北京，报告我们敬爱的毛主席。
    黄浦江畔的钟声雄壮地回响着，似乎连外滩也变得更加美好了。上海，是中国人民的天下，是中国无产阶级革命派的天下，一千万上海人民打倒了阻碍他们前进的上海党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，上海象一艘高速快艇，正沿着毛主席开辟的航道胜利前进！
    黄浦江畔的钟声响了。
    这庄严、洪亮的钟声，回响着、震荡着……它向全国和全世界宣告：我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命在上海取得了伟大胜利。它将永远鼓舞着一千万上海人民前进！再前进！！
