The Complete Collapse of the "Double Act"

The "Tao Yuan Squatting" was a disgusting "double act" performed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his wife, the bourgeois element Wang XX. Look, one of them says, "'Four Cleanups Movement' is the contradiction between 'clean' and 'unclean,'" "resolve whatever problems there are," "there must be pressure on cadres." The other then performs in Tao Yuan, driving all cadres "upstairs," regardless of the size or nature of the problem, using the "unclean" stick to beat them down, forcing confessions. One says, "Investigation meetings cannot investigate problems," "secret work must be done." The other then disguises himself in Tao Yuan, conducting secret investigations, engaging in mysterious rooting and linking...

And that's not all. They shamelessly peddle this pseudo-leftist, rightist garbage nationwide. But the more they perform, the more their faces of usurping the party and the country, and restoring capitalism, are exposed. Just as they are reveling in their triumph, the "Twenty-three Articles" personally directed by our great helmsman Chairman Mao dealt them a fatal blow, shattering their dream of restoring capitalism along with the collapse of this "double act." The dialectics of history are like this: whoever dares to oppose the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and restore capitalism will become a pile of filth despised by humanity.

　　“双簧”的彻底破产
    “桃园蹲点”，是中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆、资产阶级分子王××合演的一出令人作呕的“双簧”。你看，他们一个说“四清运动是‘四清’与‘四不清’的矛盾”，“有什么问题解决什么问题”，“对干部得有压力”；一个就在桃园表演，把干部通通赶“上楼”，不论问题大小、性质如何，都用“四不清”大棒加以打击，大搞逼供信。一个说“调查会调查不出问题来”，“要搞一些秘密工作”；一个就在桃园乔装打扮，私查暗访，大搞神秘化的扎根串连……如此等等。这还不够，他们又恬不知耻地向全国兜售这套形“左”实右的黑货。但是，他们表演得越充分，其篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的面目也就暴露得越彻底。就在他们得意忘形之际，我们伟大舵手毛主席亲自主持制定的“二十三条”，给中国赫鲁晓夫以致命的打击，使他的复辟资本主义的美梦也随着这出“双簧”的破产而破产了。历史的辩证法就是这样：谁胆敢反对光焰无际的毛泽东思想，复辟资本主义，谁就会变成不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
