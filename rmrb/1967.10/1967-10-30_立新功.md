Many revolutionary cadres from various fronts in Shanghai, following Chairman Mao's instructions to not rely on past achievements but to achieve new merits, have, with the help of the proletarian revolutionary masses, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and have achieved new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	To the Masses

Ma Yili, the former first secretary of the Party Committee of East China Normal University, realized that he had been deceived by the top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, and had implemented the reactionary bourgeois line. He rolled up his bedding and moved into the students' dormitory to learn from the revolutionary youngsters. Where the masses had the most complaints, he went there; if a class of youngsters wanted to criticize him, he moved his bedding to that class to accept their criticism. Under the guidance of the youngsters, he thoroughly examined his soul, recognized his mistakes, and corrected them. Now, he has gained the trust and support of the youngsters and has been appointed as the first deputy director of the revolutionary committee of the school, achieving new merits in the movement to resume classes and carry out the revolution.

	Daring to Take on Heavy Responsibilities

After being elected as the director of the revolutionary and production promotion frontline command department of the Shanghai Automobile Transportation Company, Chen Lian faced the first difficulty: the issue of replacing vehicles supporting inland construction. At that time, the company needed to send a large number of people and vehicles to the inland areas to support construction, replacing the comrades who had been working there. Someone said, "During the Cultural Revolution, people should not be transferred; transferring people now is disrupting the Cultural Revolution." Chen Lian considered that supporting inland construction is an important measure to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." He should not be afraid of difficulties and should resolutely do a good job in the replacement work. Later, he took the initiative to rely on various revolutionary mass organizations, discuss together, and do a good job in political and ideological work. Nine workshops (factories) shared the replacement tasks, thus not affecting the struggle-criticism-transformation at the grassroots level and ensuring the normal progress of the inland construction tasks.

	Establishing New Styles

Xu Zhuye, the deputy director of the revolutionary committee and former Party branch secretary of the Controlling River Middle School, used to often sit in the office giving blind orders. In the past few months, she had not even visited some classrooms. After being tempered by the Cultural Revolution, she changed. During the "Three Summers," she went to the countryside to labor with the students. Upon arriving at the village, before she had even opened her bag, she immediately went to various production teams to understand the situation, arrange the students' labor and life, and discuss with the class cadres how to focus on studying Chairman Mao's works. On the way back, the students all praised her for changing her old style.

	Politics as the Commander

Yin Weiming, the former deputy director of the Screw Cap Factory No. 8, saw that the production group leaders and the revolutionary committee members in charge of production did not pay much attention to the big criticism movement. He recalled that the old problem in leading production was the separation of politics from production, and not using politics to guide production. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." He examined himself on one hand and organized the production leaders to study Chairman Mao's works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas." Through study, everyone realized that politics must be placed in the primary position. Now, from the production group leaders to the revolutionary committee members in charge of production, all actively participate in the big criticism movement.

### 立新功

    立新功
    上海各条战线的许多革命干部，遵照毛主席关于不要吃老本，要立新功的教导，在无产阶级革命派的帮助下，斗私批修，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
        到群众中去
    华东师范大学原党委第一书记姚力，认识到自己上了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人的当，执行了资产阶级反动路线时，就卷起铺盖住到学生宿舍中去，向革命小将学习。那里群众意见最多，他就到那里去；那个班级的小将要批判他，他就搬起铺盖到这个班级去接受小将们的批评。在小将们的帮助下，他狠触了自己的灵魂，认识了错误，改正了错误。现在，他已取得小将们的谅解信任，担任了校革命委员会第一副主任，在复课闹革命中立新功。
        敢于挑重担
    上海市汽车运输公司原副经理程涟被推选担任了公司抓革命、促生产第一线指挥部主任委员以后，首先遇到的一个难题是支援内地建设的运输车辆轮换问题。当时，公司需要派大批人和车，到内地去支援建设，代替原来在那边工作的同志。这时候，有人说：“在文化大革命期间不应该调人，现在调人是破坏文化大革命。”程涟考虑到支援内地建设是贯彻毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”伟大战略方针的一个重要措施，应当不怕困难，坚决做好轮换工作。后来他就主动依靠各革命群众组织，共同商量，做好政治思想工作，由九个场
  （厂）分摊了轮换任务，这样既不影响基层单位的斗批改，又保证了内地建设任务的正常进行。
        建立新作风
    控江中学革命委员会副主任、原党支部书记许竹叶过去经常坐在办公室里瞎指挥，到学校几个月，有些班级的教室一次都没有去过。经过文化大革命烈火的锻炼，她变了。“三夏”期间，她和学生一起下乡劳动。到了农村，她的背包还没有解开，就马上到各生产队去了解情况，安排同学的劳动和生活，还和班级干部研究如何抓紧学习毛主席著作的问题。在回来的时候，同学们都称赞她改变了旧作风。
        政治作统帅
    螺帽八厂原副厂长尹维明看到厂里的生产组长和革委会抓生产的同志不大关心大批判运动，他联想到过去领导生产的老毛病就是政治与生产脱离，不是用政治来统帅生产。他反复学习了毛主席的教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”他一面检查自己，一面组织抓生产的同志学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等著作。通过学习，使大家认识到必须把政治放在首要地位。现在，从生产组长到革委会抓生产的领导同志都积极投入大批判运动。
