    Fongvihin said at the National Day reception of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation that China is the iron wall of the world revolution.

    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Khamkeut, the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation to Laos held a reception on September 27 to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Guests invited to the reception included Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao Patriotic Government, Zaleng, Representative of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front in Champasak Province, and leaders of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, including Vonglou, Chanphou, and Mahakhou. Also present were officials from various organizations and mass groups, officers and heroes from the Lao People's Liberation Army and the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, as well as representatives of the Chinese and Vietnamese communities.

    Representatives from the Vietnamese Economic and Cultural Delegation to Laos were also invited to the reception.

    Zhu Ying, head of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation to Laos, said in his speech that the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victories of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line.

    He pointed out that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. With the great spirit of a contemporary proletarian revolutionary, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This is an unprecedented achievement in the history of the international communist movement.

    Zhu Ying, in his speech, warmly praised the anti-American national salvation struggles of the Lao and Vietnamese peoples. He reiterated: The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will forever be the strong backing of the Lao and Vietnamese peoples, firmly supporting the Lao and Vietnamese peoples in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

    Phoumi Vongvichit said in his speech that the great victories and achievements of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong have provided a model for the revolutionary peoples of the world, fundamentally changing the balance of power in the world. Today, China is the iron wall of the world revolution and a reliable strong backing for the Lao revolution and the revolutions of the peoples of various Asian countries. The Lao people regard all the victories of the Chinese people as their own victories.

    The Lao friends attending the reception eagerly took Mao Zedong's works, portraits, and badges, fully demonstrating the deep affection of the Lao people for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.
