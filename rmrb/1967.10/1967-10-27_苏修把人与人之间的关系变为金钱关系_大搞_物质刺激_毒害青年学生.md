Editor's Note: Marx and Engels, in their analysis of capitalist society, sharply pointed out: "It turns the relationship between people into nothing but naked self-interest, and cold-blooded 'cash transactions,' with no other connection."

Fifty years after the great October Socialist Revolution, this cold-blooded "cash transaction" has re-emerged on Soviet soil.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has carried out a comprehensive restoration of capitalism in the world's first socialist state. This bunch of traitors advocates "material incentives" and "profit in command," shamelessly peddling the reactionary bourgeois notion that "money can buy everything." They regard "money" as the soul of social life, using bourgeois selfishness to poison the Soviet people. The purpose of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in doing so is to numb the revolutionary will of the Soviet people, making them forget the great ideal of communism, so as to consolidate their reactionary rule.

The great Lenin repeatedly called on the Soviet people to work selflessly for communism. He highly praised the communist Saturday voluntary labor, saying it was a "great creation of communism," and that this spirit of public-mindedness could overcome the "evil habits of capitalism" left to the workers and peasants. However, the Soviet revisionist clique has completely betrayed Lenin. The "material incentives" they promote are precisely the capitalist world's morality that Lenin exposed—"doing things just for money."

The Soviet revisionist clique has turned a good Soviet state into a mess, filled with the stench of copper coins, and capitalist filth is rampant. But the wheel of history cannot be stopped by the arms of a mantis! The Soviet people, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will surely throw the traitor clique and their "material incentives" into the garbage heap of history.

The Soviet Revisionists Turn Human Relations into Monetary Relations and Corrupt Youth Students with "Material Incentives"

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has comprehensively restored capitalism in the Soviet Union and promotes "material incentives" in all fields, turning human relations into capitalist monetary relations. To poison the youth and cultivate successors to revisionism, they also vigorously implement "material incentives" in the field of education, especially in higher education.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique uses scholarships and stipends to stimulate students to study. The regulations for the use of scholarships in Soviet higher education institutions stipulate that scholarships should first be given to students who receive "excellent" and "good" grades in exams. Moreover, the scholarship system they implement is the same as their wage system, with a "basic scholarship" plus bonuses. According to incomplete statistics, their scholarships amount to as many as fifty-five kinds. The basic scholarship for a university student is set at twenty-five to sixty rubles per month, while excellent students increase their basic scholarship by twenty-five percent; if they are excellent students recommended by various units, their scholarships are increased by another fifteen percent compared to their classmates who are excellent students.

"Material incentives" are the "magic wand" used by the Soviet revisionist clique to adjust the number of certain disciplines and balance the distribution of university graduates. For example, to ensure the number of students in some "unpopular" disciplines, they use high scholarships to stimulate students to enroll. The Special Education Department of Lenin Pedagogical Institute is an example. This department specializes in training teachers for deaf-mute schools. Because there are few students enrolling, the school authorities use a scholarship that is one-third higher than other departments to attract students to study this major. In addition, to "encourage" university graduates to work in border areas or rural areas, they widely publicize and attract university graduates to work in rural areas with the so-called "experience." This so-called "experience" is nothing more than the collective farm promising to provide graduates with superior material conditions, such as comfortable housing, generous wages, longer vacations, and even finding a suitable spouse. In a word, it is still "material incentives."

Soviet schools emphasize academic achievement first and educate students to pursue fame and fortune. For example, the Soviet authorities stipulate that university students who serve as student union or Komsomol cadres will increase their scholarships, and even those who serve as Young Pioneer counselors in middle schools will be used as a condition for university students to receive bonuses. As for the "material incentives" for teachers to engage in administrative or social work, it is even more severe. For example, if a professor also serves as the head of a department or dean, his salary can be increased by fifty percent.

Soviet schools stipulate that students must participate in a certain amount of productive labor, which is also carried out under the banner of "material incentives." Students who work in factories during internships will receive wages. Students who participate in one month of labor during winter and summer vacations are also strange "material incentives." Before the winter and summer vacations, the school will announce in advance the work location, work items, and wage income to the students, and the students will choose according to the principle of light work and high pay.

Teachers and students participating in scientific research also cannot do without "material incentives." Students who participate in research groups and achieve certain results will be awarded medals and bonuses, and if they are appreciated by professors, they can become graduate students and be recruited into the research team. The Soviet revisionists use the bourgeois academic title system to "stimulate" scientific researchers. After scientific researchers obtain the title of associate professor, they can become lecturers, and their salaries can immediately be increased by several dozen rubles compared to those doing the same work but without the title of associate professor; after obtaining the title of professor, they can become professors, researchers, chief engineers, academicians, and their salaries can reach three hundred and fifty to two thousand five hundred rubles, plus additional income from part-time teaching, royalties, etc., which is simply incalculable.

The Soviet revisionist clique's promotion of "material incentives" in the field of education has seriously corrupted Soviet youth, resulting in extremely serious consequences. However, Soviet youth will one day see through the revisionist conspiracy and rise up to break the spiritual shackles around their necks.

### 苏修把人与人之间的关系变为金钱关系  大搞“物质刺激”毒害青年学生

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

    编者按　马克思和恩格斯在剖析资本主义社会时，一针见血地指出：“它使人和人之间除了赤裸裸的利害关系，除了冷酷无情的‘现金交易’，就再也没有任何别的联系了。”
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命五十年后的今天，这种冷酷无情的“现金交易”，竟然在苏联的国土上重新出现了。
    苏修统治集团在世界上第一个社会主义国家实行了全面的资本主义复辟。这伙叛徒大搞“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”，无耻地贩卖“有了钱就有了一切”的反动资产阶级货色。他们把“钱”看做是社会生活的灵魂，用资产阶级的利己主义毒害苏联人民。苏修统治集团这样做的目的，就是要麻痹苏联人民的革命意志，使他们忘记共产主义的伟大理想，以巩固其反动统治。
    伟大的列宁曾一再号召苏联人民为共产主义而忘我地劳动。他高度赞扬共产主义星期六义务劳动，说这是“共产主义的伟大创举”，并且说，这种公而忘私的精神可以战胜“万恶的资本主义遗留给工农的习惯”。但是，苏修集团完全背叛了列宁。他们推行的“物质刺激”正是列宁所揭露的资本主义世界的道德——“做事就是为了拿钱”。
    苏修集团把一个好端端的苏维埃国家搞得乌烟瘴气，铜臭熏天，资本主义的污泥浊水大肆泛滥。但是，历史的车轮岂是螳臂所能阻挡！具有十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，一定会把叛徒集团连同它的“物质刺激”丢进历史垃圾堆。
    苏修把人与人之间的关系变为金钱关系
    大搞“物质刺激”毒害青年学生
    苏修统治集团在苏联全面复辟资本主义，在各个领域内大搞“物质刺激”，把人与人之间的关系变成资本主义的金钱关系。他们为了毒害青年，培养修正主义接班人，在教育领域内，特别是在高等教育中，也大力贯彻“物质刺激”。
    苏修统治集团是用助学金和奖学金来刺激学生从事学习的。苏修高等学校助学金使用条例规定，首先要发给在考试中获得“优”和“良”的评分的学生。不仅如此，苏修搞的这一套助学金制同他们的工资制一样，也分为“基本助学金”加奖励。据不完全统计，他们的奖学金竟多达五十五种。一个大学生的基本助学金定额为每月二十五——六十卢布，而优等生则增加基本助学金的百分之二十五；如果是各单位保送来的优等生，又比他同年级优等生的助学金还要提高百分之十五。
      “物质刺激”是苏修集团调剂某些学科人数和平衡大学毕业生分配地区的“法码”。例如，为了保证某些“冷门”学科的人数，就用高额助学金来刺激学生报考。列宁师范学院特殊教育系就是一例，该系专门培养聋哑学校的师资，因为报考的学生少，学校当局就用比其他系科高三分之一强的助学金来引诱学生学习这一专业。此外，为了“鼓励”大学毕业生到边疆或农村工作，大肆宣扬吸引大学毕业生去农村工作的所谓“经验”。这种所谓“经验”，不过是农庄答应给毕业生提供优越的物质条件，如舒适的住宅、优厚的工资、较长的休假期，甚至还答应代找合适的爱人等。一句话，还是“物质刺激”。
    苏修学校大搞智育第一，教育学生追名逐利。例如，苏修当局规定，大学生担任学生会或共青团的干部就增加助学金，甚至把在中学担任少先队辅导员的，也作为大学生获得奖金的条件。至于对教职员担任行政工作或社会工作的“物质刺激”，就更厉害了。例如，一个教授如果兼任系主任或院长，工资就可增加百分之五十。
    苏修学校规定学生要参加一定的生产劳动，也是在“物质刺激”的招牌下进行的。学生在工厂实习劳动要发给工资。学生利用一次寒暑假参加一个月的劳动，也是离奇的“物质刺激”。在寒暑假前，校方就把劳动地点、劳动项目和工资收入等预先向学生公布，由学生按活轻钱多的原则去选择。
    教师和学生参加科研工作也离不开“物质刺激”。学生参加科研小组，做出一定成绩，就发给奖章和奖金，如果被教授赏识，可以当研究生，被拉入科研队伍。苏修是用资产阶级的学衔制来“刺激”科研人员的。科研人员获得副博士学位以后，就可以当上讲师，而且工资马上就可以比担任同一工作但没有副博士学位的人增加几十卢布；获得博士学位以后，就可以当教授、研究员、总工程师、院士，工资高达三百五十——二千五百卢布，再加上兼课费、稿费等收入，简直无法计算。
    苏修集团在教育领域内推行“物质刺激”，严重地腐蚀着苏联青年，造成了极其严重的后果。但是，苏联青年总有一天会识破修正主义的阴谋，起来斩断套在他们脖子上的精神枷锁。
