The largest industrial frequency heat treatment equipment in our country, with the fastest speed, the best quality, and the lowest cost, was born in Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. It shows that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution promotes the thought revolution of people, thus making all work done more, faster, better, and more economically.

The development of national industry urgently needs giant cold-rolling mills. The rolls of such mills require extremely hard material and are also long, large, and heavy. To solve the surface quenching of such large rolls, the usual method is to heat them in a "pit furnace" first and then place them in an oil or water tank for quenching. This method has complex processes, is difficult to control, has a low yield rate, and takes a long time, with high costs. Industrial frequency heat treatment is a new technology. Using this method, heating and quenching can be done simultaneously, the process is simple, the yield rate is high, the quality is good, the cycle is shortened by half, and the cost is only one-third of the previous method.

The industrial frequency quenching of rolls was first adopted in our country by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory. However, to solve the industrial frequency heat treatment equipment for rolls with a diameter of two meters, not only does our country not have it, but it is also very difficult to find in the world.

The thunderous storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shattered the spiritual shackles imposed by the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The revolutionary masses of Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, took "Three Articles" as their motto, took "On Practice" as their action guideline, and in just ten months, quickly, efficiently, and economically produced this ten-meter-high equipment.

The boldness of the "little people"

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." By the third quarter of last year, the manufacture of giant cold-rolling mills was left with three major key problems. The quenching of large rolls was one of them. How to solve this key issue? Some department heads felt it was troublesome and did not want to take on this heavy responsibility. However, a few ordinary lathe operators, fitters, heat treatment workers, and electricians bravely took on this responsibility. They said, "Chairman Mao calls on us to 'grasp revolution, promote production.' The burden of industrial frequency is the heaviest; if we workers don't do it, who will? They expressed their confidence: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we workers are your most loyal soldiers. With your brilliant thoughts as our guide, all difficulties are just paper tigers!"

The boldness of the "little people" surprised some, impressed others, and worried a few. Some even "advised" them, saying, "This matter is very responsible; if it succeeds, there's nothing to it, but if it fails, it's serious!" But more people expressed their support. Thus, under the support of revolutionary cadres, with these comrades as the main force, supplemented by some workers and mechanical and electrical technicians who had not even attended a vocational school, a small team was formed to start work.

Turning the reversed design back to normal

Where should the design of such a large piece of equipment start? One method is to follow the so-called design path of bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," which would take at least half a year just to complete the drawings. The small team, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, broke through superstitions and liberated their thoughts in the great criticism. They believed they must not take this path. They decided to follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "seizing the day" and blaze a trail of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

The comrades of the small team, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the correct ideas of people come from social practice, from the three kinds of practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment," bravely took the first step. They combined with the heat treatment workers who would use the equipment in the future. As future operators of this equipment, they had the richest practical experience and the most practical structural requirements. They drew rough sketches on the ground with chalk, discussed structures, calculated, and debated. They drew many inspirations from the ten-thousand-ton hydraulic presses they dealt with every day. Based on these inspirations, the structural idea of an industrial frequency equipment gradually took shape.

Because they were originally production workers, they best understood the need to consider the convenience of processing workers during design. They widely listened to the opinions of processors. The design and processing processes were closely intertwined, taking only four months to not only determine the structure of the equipment and complete the machine design but also surprisingly, some important parts had already been processed.

The comrades in charge of electrical work took the site as the drawing, directly drawing the pattern on the equipment and steel plates, saving hundreds of drawings, and arranging the most reasonable positions for wires, copper bars, pipes, cables, and instruments. They continuously modified and improved the design during the manufacturing process.

Compared to the old methods, some people called this design method "reversed" design. However, this design method is so in line with Chairman Mao's epistemology! Therefore, it is more accurate to say that these comrades turned the design, which had been reversed by those bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities," back to normal.

Taking their destiny into their own hands

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party did everything they could to sabotage the revolution and production, and the industrial frequency equipment was in an extremely difficult situation. When the counter-revolutionary wind of economism blew, the manufacture of industrial frequency equipment was almost paralyzed.

At this time, the "January Revolution" storm swept across Shanghai, and the revolutionary masses of this factory fiercely struck down the counter-revolutionary wind of economism, seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The revolutionary masses fully supported the industrial frequency equipment small team, putting the destiny of the industrial frequency equipment completely in the hands of the revolutionary masses.

The parts of the industrial frequency equipment were all large pieces. Processing large pieces required large machine tools, but the large machine tools in the factory all had heavy processing tasks. Adding the processing of the main columns and beams of the industrial frequency equipment was really difficult to schedule. The rebel corps, processing masters, dispatchers, and the small team of the factory held a meeting to discuss and find a way. Without affecting the plan, they did not mind the trouble of loading and unloading, using idle time to squeeze in and process. Several large pieces were quickly processed. After that, the manufacture of the industrial frequency equipment advanced at a rapid pace.

To save money is to make revolution

Chairman Mao's great directive of "to save money is to make revolution" struck a chord with the workers. The working class best understands the bitterness of the past and the sweetness of today. They deeply understood Chairman Mao's words that "China is a big country, but it is still very poor, and it will take decades to make China rich." When they accepted the task, they boldly envisioned making this industrial frequency equipment capable of quenching both large rolls that three or four people can embrace and small rolls the size of a bowl. They overcame various difficulties and finally produced this large and small dual-purpose industrial frequency heat treatment equipment, saving the country tens of millions of yuan.

During the design and manufacture of the industrial frequency equipment, the comrades of the small team carefully calculated and saved, making full use of scrap materials. From the scrap pile to every corner of the workshop, from the soil tools that had made great contributions to the manufacture of the ten-thousand-ton hydraulic press to the steel ingot heads ready to be remelted, whatever old gears, flat plates, screws, boxes... as long as they were useful, they were collected and used. It is estimated that in the entire equipment, they used more than 60% of scrap and surplus blanks.

    毛泽东思想武装的中国人民有志气有能力赶上和超过世界先进水平
    我国最大工频热处理设备在上海诞生
    据新华社上海二十日电　我国最大的工频热处理设备，以最快的速度，最好的质量，最低的成本，在无产阶级文化大革命中，在上海重型机器厂诞生了。
    这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。它说明：无产阶级文化大革命促进了人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多更快更好更省。
    国家工业的发展，迫切需要巨型的冷轧机，这种冷轧机的轧辊，质地要求非常硬，而且又长又大又重。要解决这样大轧辊的表面淬火，通常是先在“井式炉”内加热，然后再放到油槽或水槽内淬火。这种办法，工艺复杂，难以掌握，成品率低，并且周期很长，成本也高。工频热处理是一项新技术，用这种办法，可以边加热边淬火，工艺简单，成品率高，质量好，周期压缩一半，成本只有前者的三分之一。
    轧辊的工频淬火，在我国是由沈阳重型机器厂首先采用的。然而，要解决直径二米大轧辊淬火的工频热处理设备，不但我国没有，而且在世界上也很难找到。
    无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚风雷，摧毁了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派强加在人们精神上的枷锁。上海重型机器厂无产阶级革命派，遵循毛主席的教导，以“老三篇”为座右铭，以《实践论》为行动纲领，只用了十个月的时间，多快好省地把这台身高十米的设备制成了。
          “小人物”的胆略
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”到去年第三季度，巨型冷轧机的制造剩下三个最大的关键问题。大轧辊的淬火问题，就是其中之一。如何解决这一关键？有的部门的原领导人感到棘手，不愿意挑起这副重担。然而，有几位普通车工、钳工、热处理工和电工却勇敢地挑起了这副重担。他们说，毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，搞工频的担子最重，我们工人不干谁干！他们充满信心地表示：毛主席呀毛主席，我们工人是您最忠诚的战士，有您的光辉思想作指导，一切困难只不过是纸老虎！
    “小人物”的大胆略，使有的人惊讶，有的人钦佩，也有的人为他们担心。有人甚至“劝”他们说：“这种事责任重大，搞好了没啥，搞坏了不得了！”但是更多的人表示支持。就这样，在革命领导干部的支持下，以这些同志为主，再配备上部分工人和连中专学校也没有进过的机械、电器技术员，组成了一支小分队，开始工作了。
    把颠倒了的设计再颠倒过来
    这样大型设备的设计，从那里入手呢？一条办法是循规蹈矩，按资产阶级“权威”、“专家”的所谓设计必由之路去做，这样做单出齐图纸，起码就得半年时间。经受了无产阶级文化大革命洗礼的小分队，在大批判中破除了迷信，解放了思想，他们认为绝不能走这条路。他们表示要按照毛主席“只争朝夕”的伟大教导，闯出一条多快好省的道路来。
    小分队的同志按照毛主席的“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来”的教导，勇敢地跨出第一步，和将来使用设备的热处理工人相结合，让他们也参加设计。作为这台设备的未来操作者，他们有最丰富的实践经验，有最切实际的结构要求。他们用粉笔在地上画草图，商议结构、计算、争论。他们从每天接触的万吨水压机中得到很多启示，根据这些启示，一台工频设备的结构设想逐渐形成了。
    因为他们本来是生产工人，所以最懂得在设计时考虑加工工人的方便。他们广泛地去听取加工者的意见。设计和加工的过程紧紧交织在一起，只花了四个月的时间，不仅确定了设备的结构，完成了机器的设计，惊人的是，部分重要零件也已经加工完成了。
    搞电器的同志把现场作为图纸，直接在设备上、钢板上画图样，省去了上百张图纸，布置出最合理的线路、铜排、管料、电缆、仪表的位置。他们在制造过程中不断修改、完善设计。
    和老的一套方法对比，有人把这种设计方法，叫作“颠倒”了的设计。然而这套设计方法，多么符合毛主席的认识论呀！因此，更确切地说，是这些同志，把原来被那些资产阶级“学者”“权威”颠倒了的设计，再颠倒了过来。
          自己掌握命运
    无产阶级文化大革命兴起后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派千方百计破坏革命，破坏生产，工频设备也处在极端困难的境地。在反革命经济主义妖风刮起的时候，工频的制造几乎陷于瘫痪。
    正在这时，“一月革命”风暴席卷整个上海，这个厂的无产阶级革命派狠狠地痛击了反革命经济主义妖风，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权。革命派全力支持了工频设备小分队，把工频设备的命运完全掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。
    工频设备的零件都是大件。加工大件需要大机床，而厂里的大机床都有很繁重的加工任务，再要加工工频的主柱和横梁，实在难以排上计划。工厂的造反队、加工老师傅、调度员和小分队一起开会商讨，想出了办法。在不影响计划的情况下，不嫌装卸的麻烦，利用空隙时间见缝插针，挤进去加工。几个大件的加工很快就完成了。此后，工频设备的制造以突飞猛进的速度向前进展。
          要节约闹革命
      “要节约闹革命”。毛主席的这个伟大指示，说到了工人的心坎里。工人阶级最了解昔日苦，今日甜。他们对毛主席说的“中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间”理解得最深。他们接受任务时就大胆设想把这台工频设备造得既能淬三——四人合抱的大轧辊，又能淬碗口粗细的小轧辊。他们克服了种种困难，终于制成了这台大小两用的工频热处理设备，为国家节约了几十万元的财富。
    小分队同志在设计制造工频的过程中，处处精打细算，尽量利用废旧料，从废料堆到车间的每个角落，从当年制造万吨水压机立下汗马功劳的土工具到准备回炉的钢锭料头，什么旧齿轮、平板，什么螺丝、箱壳……只要有用的，都搜集起来，用了上去。据初步估计，在整台设备中，他们利用的废旧零件，多余毛坯，就达到百分之六十以上。
