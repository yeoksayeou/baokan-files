By war hero Huang Wenda, leading a delegation from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the delegation concluded their friendly visit to China, carrying with them the deep friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples in the struggle. Tonight, they departed from Nanning by airplane to return to South Vietnam.

Huang Wenda, the delegation leader, delivered an impassioned speech upon departure. He said, "During our visit to China, we deeply felt the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the people of South Vietnam who are fighting against American aggression. What made us particularly happy is that we witnessed with our own eyes the great strength of China in all aspects, the great achievements made in the past eighteen years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the beloved Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, as well as the great support of the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation."

He expressed that upon returning, he would convey the lofty friendship of the 700 million Chinese people to the people of South Vietnam and was determined to continue the struggle against American aggression for national liberation until the final victory.

The South Vietnamese comrades arrived in Nanning this morning by a special plane from Guangzhou.

Upon their arrival and departure from Nanning, they were warmly welcomed and seen off by thousands of military and civilian personnel from the Guangxi Military Region and relevant departments, as well as revolutionary masses and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanning.

The South Vietnamese comrades, coming from the front lines of the struggle against American aggression, reluctantly boarded the plane. The people who came to see them off held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," as well as portraits of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, repeatedly shouting, "The Vietnamese people will surely win, American imperialism will surely fail! The 700 million Chinese people are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people!"

Huang Wenda and other South Vietnamese comrades were deeply moved as they shook hands and embraced the people who came to see them off, and repeatedly waved in farewell.

The deputy consul, Le Quang Dan, from the Vietnamese Consulate General in Nanning, and other Vietnamese comrades in Nanning also went to the airport to see them off.

On October 18, the delegation from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam visited the site of the former Peasant Movement Training Institute, where the great leader Chairman Mao held classes during the First Revolutionary Civil War in Guangzhou.

After the visit, Huang Wenda wrote in the guestbook, sincerely wishing Chairman Mao a long life.
