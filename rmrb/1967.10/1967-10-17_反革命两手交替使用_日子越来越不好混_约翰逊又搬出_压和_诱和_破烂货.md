The counterrevolutionaries use two hands alternately, and the days are getting harder and harder to get by. Johnson brings out the old junk of "pressure and enticement."

    NEW YORK, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) — In the face of increasing defeats in the Vietnam War and growing opposition both domestically and internationally, U.S. imperialist head Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk have recently made a series of speeches to defend the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam. They blatantly play tricks on the Vietnamese people with the tactics of "bombing to force negotiations" and "stopping bombing to entice negotiations."

    On September 29, Johnson delivered a speech in San Antonio, Texas, on Vietnam and other issues. In this so-called "important speech" hyped by U.S. media, he threw out various bandit logic, advocating U.S. aggression, and once again brought out the failed tactics of "pressure and enticement." While slandering the Vietnamese people who are bravely resisting U.S. aggression, Johnson talked about how "the U.S. is willing to stop air and naval strikes against North Vietnam if this will quickly lead to fruitful discussions." Following this, Rusk said at a press conference on October 12 that if Hanoi says "yes" to Johnson's proposal, "publicly or privately," he would "leave today" for "negotiations."

    Johnson's "peace talk" proposal on September 29 is a repeat of the U.S. imperialists' tactic of confusing the aggressor with the victim, attempting to stop North Vietnamese people from supporting their compatriots in the South with the so-called "principle of equality." At the press conference on October 12, Rusk once again clearly stated: The U.S. needs to know what Hanoi will do if we stop bombing. The Associated Press commented on Johnson's speech, pointing out that the speech "is basically the same as the previous U.S. policy on stopping bombing," only using "some deliberately conciliatory words."

    Johnson and Rusk's coordinated speeches aim to push forward the "peace talk" offensive recently launched by the U.S. in collusion with the Soviet revisionists and other reactionaries, from the United Nations to the Vatican, from New Delhi to Belgrade. The purpose is to create a "peace talk" situation to stop the U.S. from continuing to suffer defeats in South Vietnam and to ease the growing domestic criticism of the Vietnam War, preparing for the 1968 elections.

    However, the U.S. imperialists' wishful thinking will never come true. Johnson, Rusk, and their ilk have repeatedly admitted that the U.S. has made dozens of "peace talk" proposals, but they have not deceived the Vietnamese people. The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam has repeatedly shown that when they sing the tune of "peace talk," it is precisely when they suffer greater failures and difficulties in the Vietnam War, desperately trying to make a last-ditch effort.

    Recently, U.S. imperialism has suffered heavy defeats in its wars against South and North Vietnam, with increasing losses of personnel and aircraft. To exert war pressure and intimidation on the Vietnamese people, it not only intensifies the unprecedented large-scale bombing of North Vietnam but also spreads the word that the U.S. has formulated plans to attack the North, attempting to probe and prepare public opinion for escalating the war. It also deploys more troops to the south of the military demarcation line and establishes a massive supply base there.

    In their speeches, Johnson and Rusk repeatedly emphasize that South Vietnam is "extremely important" to U.S. "national interests," that the U.S. has a "clear obligation" to its South Vietnamese puppets, that the U.S. "will not waver and retreat," and that the U.S. will provide everything needed for the U.S. troops in Vietnam. Rusk menacingly shouted that if anyone "enemy of the U.S." thinks the U.S. determination to invade Vietnam is a bluff, the result might bring disaster to all mankind.

    While talking about "peace," the U.S. imperialists are expanding the war. "Peace" is a lie, insisting on aggression is the truth. The counterrevolutionary two-pronged strategy is used alternately, making things worse every day.

    The heroic Vietnamese people have already smashed the U.S. imperialists' war and peace counterrevolutionary two-pronged strategy with their persistent and brave struggle. Whether it is Johnson's "peace talk" offensive or the U.S. imperialists' offensive on the battlefield, they will all end in utter failure.

### 反革命两手交替使用　日子越来越不好混　约翰逊又搬出“压和”“诱和”破烂货

　　反革命两手交替使用　日子越来越不好混
　　约翰逊又搬出“压和”“诱和”破烂货
    新华社十四日讯　华盛顿消息：在侵越战场上越败越惨，侵越战争在国内外受到愈益强烈的抨击和反对的情况下，美帝国主义头子约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克，最近连续发表谈话，为美国侵越政策进行无耻的辩解，露骨地对越南人民玩弄“以炸迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋。
    约翰逊九月二十九日在美国圣安东尼奥就越南等问题发表讲话。他在这篇被美国报刊宣传的所谓“重要讲话”里抛出了各种各样的强盗逻辑，宣扬美国的侵略政策，并且再次把屡遭破产的“压和”、“诱和”等破烂货搬了出来。约翰逊在对英勇反抗美国侵略的越南人民进行无耻的诬蔑的同时，大谈什么“美国愿意停止对北越的空中和海上的轰击，只要这样会迅速导致有成果的讨论。”接着，腊斯克十二日在记者招待会上就说，只要河内对约翰逊的建议“公开或私下说一声‘行’”那么他“今天就动身”去“谈判”。
    约翰逊九月二十九日的“和谈”建议，是美帝一再玩弄的混淆侵略者与被侵略者、妄图阻止越南北方人民支援自己的南方同胞的所谓“对等原则”的翻版。腊斯克在十二日的记者招待会上再一次明确提出：美国需要知道，如果我们停炸，“河内将会怎样做”。美联社在评论约翰逊的讲话时也指出，这个讲话“基本上同以前的美国对停止轰炸的政策是一样的”，只不过是使用了“一些有意识地使人听来感到和解的字眼”。
    约翰逊和腊斯克的这番一搭一档的讲话，是要把美帝最近勾结苏修和其他反动派，从联合国到梵蒂冈，从新德里到贝尔格莱德展开的“和谈”攻势，向前推进一步，其目的仍然是妄图搞出一个“和谈”局面来以阻止美帝在南越战场上越败越惨的局面继续发展，同时也是为了缓和国内对侵越战争越来越强烈的抨击，应付即将到来的一九六八年大选。
    但是，美帝国主义者的这些如意打算是永远不会得逞的。约翰逊、腊斯克之流多次承认，“和谈”的建议，美国已经提出过数十次，并未骗得了越南人民。美帝国主义侵略越南的行径一再说明，当它大唱“和谈”滥调之时，也就是它在侵越战争中遭到更大失败和困难，妄图进一步铤而走险以作垂死挣扎之日。
    最近，美帝国主义在对越南南方和北方的战争中，接连遭受惨重失败，人员、飞机，损失越来越大。为了向越南人民施加战争压力和进行战争恫吓，它不仅加紧对越南北方进行空前规模的狂轰滥炸，而且还放出空气说什么美国已经制订了进攻北方的计划，以便为扩大战争进行试探和准备舆论。它还向军事分界线南侧增调兵力，并在那里建立庞大的补给基地。
    约翰逊、腊斯克之流在他们的讲话里反复强调，南越对美国的“国家利益”是“极重要的”，美国对其南越傀儡的“义务是明确的”，美国“不会动摇和撤退”，美国要为侵越美军“提供需要的一切”。腊斯克杀气腾腾地叫嚷，如果同美国“为敌的任何人”认为美国侵略越南的决心是虚声恫吓，那么结果可能使全人类遭到灾难。
    美帝国主义一面谈“和”，一面扩大战争，“和”是假，坚持侵略是真，反革命两手策略交替使用，越搞日子越不好混。
    英雄的越南人民已经用自己持久的、英勇的斗争，粉碎了美帝国主义战、“和”反革命两手策略。不管是约翰逊的“和谈攻势”还是美帝国主义在战场上的“攻势”，都只能是以彻底破产而告终。
