The Soviet revisionist leading clique, in order to dress up their facade and deceive the people, continually purchase consumer goods from capitalist countries to fill their empty shelves.

Due to the full restoration of capitalism at home, the Soviet revisionist leading clique has caused extreme chaos in the Soviet economy, leading to severe shortages in market supplies. Every year, they have to import large quantities of goods from abroad. According to the Soviet revisionist Minister of Foreign Trade, Patolichev, "In the past ten years, the import of clothing has increased by forty-six times, shoes by twenty-three times, and vegetables and fruits by more than five times." Patolichev also admitted that last year alone, they imported "27 million pairs of leather shoes, sewing materials worth 221 million rubles, 327,000 tons of fresh and canned vegetables, and 36,200 tons of grapes" from some countries. These figures are a stark mockery of the Soviet revisionist leading clique, who have been boasting about "marching towards communism."

In order to decorate the "prosperity" of the festival on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet revisionist leading clique has purchased large quantities of consumer goods from Western countries. According to reports, in the first two months of this year, the Soviet revisionist leading clique alone purchased consumer goods worth 8 million pounds from Britain. According to a so-called Soviet trade expert, "This is a record-breaking figure," and the purchased items are all goods that are in short supply in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet leading clique has also signed contracts with West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland and other Western countries to import various types of clothing and daily consumer goods. According to Western news agencies, Japan will also supply the Soviet Union with textiles worth 10 million pounds. At the same time, 14 Soviet import agencies purchased clothing worth 170 million dollars at the Moscow International Clothing Exhibition.

According to the Australian "Vanguard," in Sydney, there is a special institution that sends food and clothing to the Soviet Union. The sign on the door of this institution reads: "Royal Cross Street Murray Health Food Store Branch, directly sending clothing and food parcels to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and all other republics of the Soviet Union."

An article in the "Vanguard" states: "What a serious scandal. Here, we see a concrete result of the betrayal of socialism by the Soviet leading clique. After fifty years of implementing socialism, the revisionists have opened food and clothing stores in other countries. We often hear about the difficulties faced by the betrayed Soviet people. The Soviet revisionists have not only betrayed the Soviet people but also the working people of the whole world."

The article says, "These miserable traitors are increasingly exposed, and their policy of restoring capitalism is undeniable, especially to the Soviet people."

    苏修全面复辟资本主义造成经济极端混乱供应严重不足
    向西方购买大量商品点缀节日“繁荣”
    新华社三十日讯　苏联修正主义领导集团为了装点门面，欺骗人民，不断从资本主义国家购买消费品来填补他们的空空的货架。
    苏修领导集团由于在国内全面复辟资本主义，造成苏联经济的极度混乱，市场供应严重不足，每年都不得不从国外进口大量商品。据苏修对外贸易部部长帕托利切夫供认：“最近十年以来，服装进口增加了四十六倍，鞋增加了二十三倍，蔬菜水果增加了五倍多。”帕托利切夫还承认，仅仅去年，从一些国家就进口了“二千七百万双皮鞋，价值二亿二千一百万卢布的缝纫品，三十二万七千吨鲜菜和罐头蔬菜，三万六千二百吨葡萄。”这些数字简直是对一再吹嘘“正在向共产主义迈进”的苏修领导集团的无情讽刺。
    苏修领导集团为了在伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年的前夕，点缀一下节日的“繁荣”，向西方国家大批购买消费品。据报道，苏修领导集团今年头两个月仅在英国就购买了价值八百万英镑的消费品。据一个所谓苏联贸易专家说：“这是个破纪录的数字”，购买的东西都是在苏联供不应求的货物。
    苏联领导集团还同西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、瑞典和芬兰等西方国家签订了进口各色衣服和各种日用消费品的合同。据西方通讯社透露，日本也将供应苏联价值一千万英镑的纺织品。同时，苏修十四家进口机构在莫斯科国际服装展览会上还购入价值一亿七千万美元的衣服。
    据澳大利亚《先锋报》揭露，在澳大利亚的悉尼设有专门向苏联寄送食物和衣物的机构，这个机构大门上的招牌是：“皇家十字路大街默里卫生食品商店分店，直接向爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛、乌克兰和苏联所有其它共和国寄递衣着和食物包裹”。
    《先锋报》上刊登的一篇短文写道：“这是多么严重的丑闻。在这里，我们看到了苏联领导集团背叛社会主义的一个具体结果。在实行社会主义五十年以后，修正主义者在其它国家开办食物衣着店。我们不时听到关于被背叛的苏联人民的困难境况。苏联修正主义者不仅背叛了苏联人民，而且也背叛了全世界的劳动人民。”
    短文说，苏修领导集团“这些可怜的叛徒日益暴露出来，他们的复辟资本主义的政策是掩饰不了的，尤其不能向苏联人民掩饰。”
