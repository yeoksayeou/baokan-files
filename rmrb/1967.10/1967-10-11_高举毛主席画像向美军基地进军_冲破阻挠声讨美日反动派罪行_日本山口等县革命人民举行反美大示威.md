Revolutionary people from Yamaguchi and Fukuoka prefectures in Japan, led by the revolutionary faction, held massive anti-U.S. demonstrations in front of the U.S. military bases in Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Itazuke, Fukuoka Prefecture, on October 1st. They protested against U.S. imperialism's aggression and Prime Minister Sato's visit to the puppet regime in South Vietnam, and celebrated the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with militant actions.

Several thousand participants in the two rallies, after holding meetings, marched through bustling city streets holding high portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and banners with slogans such as "Long Live the Great Leader Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Smash the anti-China conspiracies of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries!" "Down with the revisionist group led by Komoto!" They then advanced towards the U.S. military bases in Iwakuni and Itazuke.

The demonstration in Yamaguchi Prefecture was brutally suppressed by a large number of fully armed police sent by the reactionary Sato government in front of the U.S. military base in Iwakuni. However, the demonstrators, undaunted by the violence, broke through the police's various obstacles and bravely staged a sit-in protest in front of the main gate of the U.S. military base. The crowd shouted angrily, "Yankees, get out of Japan!" "Oppose U.S. aggression in Vietnam!" "Abolish the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!"

Fukuda Seigyo, a standing committee member of the left-wing Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said in a speech at a meeting attended by 2,000 people in Yamaguchi Prefecture, "The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made a great contribution to the development of world history and the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat, oppressed peoples, and nations around the world, and has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. The earth-shaking struggle of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has brought about a surging wave of revolutionary struggles around the world."

Fukuda strongly condemned U.S. imperialism, the Sato government, and the Komoto revisionist group. He said: The traitorous monopoly capitalist clique and the Sato government in Japan, following the orders of U.S. imperialism, are speeding up the revival of militarism, attempting to push Japan into the abyss of war. The Komoto revisionist group has joined Sato's chorus of "pro-American, pro-Soviet, anti-China." It is characterized by advocating "revolution" in words but counter-revolution in deeds; advocating "support for the Vietnamese people" in words but opposing the Vietnamese people in deeds; advocating "standing on the side of the Japanese people" in words but betraying the Japanese people in deeds, and degenerating into traitors who kneel before imperialism and thoroughgoing renegades, aristocrats of the working class.

Fukuda called on the revolutionary people of Yamaguchi Prefecture to unite in a fighting spirit to resolutely smash the war policies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and all anti-China conspiracies carried out by the collusion of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

At the mass rally in Fukuoka Prefecture, Hoshino Masakazu, chairman of the Fukuoka Prefecture (orthodox) branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said in his speech: China is a fortress of world revolution as solid as a rock. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have achieved one victory after another. In Japan, genuine Marxist-Leninists have risen up and have achieved great victories in the past year in their struggle against the Komoto revisionist group.

Representatives from local organizations of the Socialist Party and trade unions also spoke at the two rallies.

　　高举毛主席画像向美军基地进军　冲破阻挠声讨美日反动派罪行
　　日本山口等县革命人民举行反美大示威
    据新华社东京九日电  日本山口县和福冈县以革命派为中心的各界人民，十月一日分别在山口县的岩国和福冈县的板付美军基地，举行了声势浩大的反对美帝国主义侵略、反对佐藤“访问”南越傀儡政权的示威游行，以战斗的行动庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。参加这两个大会的数千名群众，在举行集会之后，高举伟大领袖毛主席画像和写着“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“粉碎帝、修、反反华阴谋！”“打倒宫本修正主义集团！”等口号的标语牌，经过热闹市区，分别向岩国和板付美军基地进军。
    山口县的群众游行队伍在岩国美军基地前，受到佐藤反动政府大批全副武装的警察的野蛮镇压。但是示威群众不畏强暴，冲破警察的各种阻挠，勇敢地在美军基地正门前举行了静坐斗争。群众愤怒高呼：“美国佬滚出日本去！”“反对美国侵略越南！”“废除日美安全条约！”
    日共山口县委员会（左派）常务委员福田正义在山口县两千人参加的集会上发表讲话说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利对世界历史发展和全世界无产阶级、被压迫人民和民族的革命斗争做出了伟大贡献，给美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、各国反动派以沉重的打击。中国文化大革命的天翻地覆的斗争，促使全世界的革命斗争出现了汹涌澎湃的局面。
    福田强烈谴责美帝国主义、佐藤政府和宫本修正主义集团。他说：日本卖国的垄断资本集团和佐藤政府遵照美帝国主义的意旨，加紧复活军国主义，企图把日本推向战争的深渊。宫本修正主义集团加入了佐藤的“亲美、联苏、反华”的大合唱。它的特征就是口头上说“要革命”，实际是反革命；口头上说“支持越南人民”，实际是反对越南人民；口头上说“站在日本人民的立场上”，实际是抛弃了日本人民的立场，堕落成为跪在帝国主义脚下的叛徒，彻头彻尾的变节分子、工人贵族。
    福田号召山口县革命人民以战斗的团结，坚决粉碎美日反动派的战争政策，以及帝修反勾结在一起所进行的一切反华阴谋活动。
    在福冈县举行的群众集会上，日中友好协会福冈县（正统）总部理事长柏木正一在讲话中指出：中国是世界革命坚如磐石般的堡垒。在毛泽东思想的指引下，亚非拉各国人民的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在日本，真正的马克思列宁主义者已经奋起，大造宫本修正主义集团的反，一年来取得了很大胜利。
    社会党和工会的地方组织代表等，都在这两个大会上发表讲话。
