Farewell, Heroic Albanian Comrades!
The Albanian Party and Government Delegation Leaves Beijing with the Friendship of the Chinese People

On October 14, the New China News Agency reported that the delegation led by Comrade Muhamed Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, successfully concluded its visit to China. The delegation departed Beijing by special plane, carrying with them the fighting friendship of the Chinese people towards the heroic Albanian people and the respect and warm greetings of the Chinese people to the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Thousands of revolutionary masses from the capital, filled with deep affection, went to the airport to give the warmest send-off to the Albanian comrades.

Leaders from the central government, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, Guo Moruo, Cheng Benyu, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Dongxing, went to the capital airport to give a warm send-off.

The Albanian Party and Government delegation visited China at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had achieved great victories. They enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's outstanding contributions to the creative development of Marxism-Leninism and gave unreserved support to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This visit greatly strengthened the unbreakable fighting friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, and dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

Today, revolutionary workers from the capital, people's commune members from the suburbs, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres, with boundless excitement, held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, the portraits of the great leader of the Albanian people and the close comrade of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Little Red Book of Chairman Mao's Quotations, and the quotations of Comrade Enver Hoxha. They sang revolutionary songs and gathered from all directions at the capital airport. The capital airport was adorned in festive attire. The national flags of China and Albania fluttered in the wind, and the tall buildings were decorated with large banners written in both Chinese and Albanian: "Warmly Send Off the Albanian Party and Government Delegation Led by Comrade Muhamed Shehu," "Long Live the Glorious Albanian Party of Labor!" "Salute to the Heroic Albanian People!"

When Comrades Shehu, Aliya, and others, accompanied by Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Li Fuchun, arrived at the airport, the crowd enthusiastically shouted, "Mao Zedong-Enver," "Enver-Mao Zedong," and read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "'Sea and land have friends, distant as the horizon, but close as neighbors.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends who are honey-mouthed but dagger-hearted, nor are we two-faced. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of stormy winds and rain." They also read aloud Comrade Hoxha's quotations: "The struggle against imperialism led by the United States and the struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet leaders are inseparable. Without exposing and opposing the deceptive and treacherous nature of revisionism, it is impossible to defeat imperialism and advance the world revolution."

A grand send-off ceremony was held at the airport. The military band played the national anthems of Albania and China. Then, Comrades Shehu and others, accompanied by Comrades Zhou Enlai and others, inspected the honor guards of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, and the militia and Red Guard honor guards. Afterwards, Comrades Shehu and others, accompanied by Comrades Zhou Enlai and others, circled the field to bid farewell to the crowd. At this moment, the entire airport was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and the crowd waved the national flags of China and Albania, and the red Little Red Book of Chairman Mao's Quotations, enthusiastically shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long Live the Great Friendship and Fighting Unity Between the Two Parties, Two Countries, and Two Peoples of China and Albania!" "Long Live Marxism-Leninism!" "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

More than 800 cultural and artistic soldiers from the revolutionary masses of the Beijing garrison performed the large-scale song and dance "The Great Voyage Needs a Helmsman," and revolutionary workers also performed revolutionary songs and dances "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Comrades Shehu and others warmly shook hands with the crowd to say goodbye and often walked into the crowd to shout with everyone, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" They also took photos with the revolutionary youngsters to keep as souvenirs.

When it was time to leave, Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Li Fuchun warmly embraced Comrades Shehu, Aliya, and others. Comrades Shehu, Aliya, and others stood at the door of the aircraft for a long time, repeatedly waving and gesturing to the crowd. The crowd waved the shining red revolutionary treasure, the Little Red Book of Chairman Mao's Quotations, and shouted, "Farewell, Heroic Albanian Comrades!"

Liu Xiao, Luo Guibo, and Albanian Ambassador to China Nataneli accompanied the delegation to leave Beijing.

Leaders from various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, various government departments, various headquarters, various military branches, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee also went to the airport to see them off.

Albanian diplomats stationed in China and other Albanian comrades who came to Beijing for friendly visits also went to the airport to see them off.

Ambassadors from various countries to China also went to the airport to see them off. (Photos attached)

    新华社十四日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，圆满地结束了对中国的访问，满载着中国人民对英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的战斗友谊，带着我国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的战友恩维尔·霍查同志的敬意和亲切问候，今天乘专机离开北京。首都革命群众数千人怀着依依惜别的深情，前往机场最热烈地欢送阿尔巴尼亚战友。
    中央领导同志、中央文革小组和各方面的负责人周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、李先念、聂荣臻、谢富治、刘宁一、杨成武、粟裕、郭沫若、戚本禹、姚文元、汪东兴等，前往首都机场热烈欢送。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时刻访问我国，热烈称颂毛主席创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的杰出贡献，毫无保留地支持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和无产阶级文化大革命，给了我国人民以极大的鼓舞。代表团的这次访问，大大地增强了中阿两党、两国和两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊和团结，给了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派以沉重的打击。
    今天，首都革命工人、郊区人民公社社员、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将和革命干部，怀着无限激动的心情，高举着我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高举着阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志的画像，高举着毛主席语录牌和恩维尔·霍查同志语录牌，唱着革命歌曲，从四面八方齐集首都机场。首都机场披上了节日的盛装。中阿两国国旗迎风飘扬，高大的建筑物上挂着用中阿两国文字写成的巨幅标语：“热烈欢送穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团”、“光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬！”
    当谢胡、阿利雅等同志，由周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春等同志陪同来到机场的时候，欢送的群众热烈欢呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”，并且齐声朗读毛主席语录：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”齐声朗读霍查同志语录：“反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争同反对以苏联领导人为首的现代修正主义的斗争是不可分割的。不揭露和不反对修正主义的欺骗性和背叛，就不能胜利地反对帝国主义和推进世界革命。”
    机场上举行了隆重的欢送仪式。军乐队奏阿尔巴尼亚国歌和中国国歌。接着，谢胡等阿尔巴尼亚同志由周恩来等同志陪同，检阅了中国人民解放军陆海空三军仪仗队和民兵、红卫兵仪仗队。随后，谢胡等同志由周恩来等同志陪同，绕场一周，向欢送的群众告别。这时，整个机场上锣鼓喧天，一片沸腾。欢送的群众挥动着中阿两国国旗，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，激动地一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的伟大友谊和战斗团结万岁！”“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    驻京部队无产阶级革命派文体战士八百多人，为欢送阿尔巴尼亚同志联合演出了大型歌舞《大海航行靠舵手》，革命职工也演出了革命歌舞《万岁！毛主席》。谢胡等阿尔巴尼亚同志亲切地和欢送的群众握手告别，还多次地走进群众行列，和大家一起高呼：“毛主席万岁！”同革命小将合影留念。
    临别的时候，周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春等同志，和谢胡、阿利雅等同志热烈拥抱。谢胡、阿利雅等同志久久地站在机舱门口，不断地向欢送的同志们招手致意。欢送群众挥动着红光闪闪的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，高呼：“再见，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友！”
    刘晓、罗贵波和阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利，陪同代表团离开北京。
