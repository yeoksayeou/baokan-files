The broad masses of commune members in cotton and tobacco-producing areas across the country are enthusiastically delivering high-quality cotton and tobacco. By the end of September, the amount of cotton purchased nationwide and by the beginning of October for cured tobacco exceeded the same period last year by 8.7 percent and 15.4 percent respectively, despite last year being a bumper harvest year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-producing areas of northern and southern China are resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp grain, grasp cotton, and grasp cloth." They are working with boundless enthusiasm to launch a high tide of picking and delivering new cotton. Thousands of purchasing stations are bustling with people, horses, drums, and gongs. Batch after batch of commune members, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, drive carts loaded with pure white cotton, ringing bells and beating drums to celebrate this year's cotton bumper harvest and deliver the new cotton to the state.

The broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-producing areas unanimously declared: We will not let Chairman Mao down. We are determined to pick and deliver cotton meticulously, to deliver more cotton and high-quality cotton to the state, and to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, socialist construction, and world revolution with concrete actions.

This year's cotton purchasing, except for a few cotton-producing areas, generally began in mid-August, about ten days earlier than last year. The progress of cotton purchasing is fast, and the concentration is large, which is a rare new situation since the founding of New China. By the end of September, the amount of cotton purchased nationwide has increased by 8.7 percent compared to the same period last year, which was also a bumper harvest year. Among them, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Beijing have seen significant increases in purchasing volumes compared to the same period last year. The ten provinces and municipalities collectively purchased 43 percent more cotton than the same period last year. The quality of cotton is also better than last year. This is the result of the broad masses of commune members, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary workers on the purchasing frontline in various places, who, during the Cultural Revolution, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and insist on "grasp revolution, promote production." It is the result of the People's Liberation Army supporting agriculture, and it is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Since this year, with the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres in the vast cotton-producing areas of our country have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and used various forms to deeply expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious," "three selfs and one package," and "four freedoms" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. The revolutionary criticism has greatly enhanced the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," carried forward the spirit of "farming for revolution," overcame natural disasters such as drought, pests, and hail, and achieved a bumper harvest of cotton.

After the new cotton went on the market, the State Council and the Central Military Commission dispatched revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses from various relevant departments to form "grasp revolution, promote production" cotton teams to work in key cotton-producing counties across the country. Revolutionary committees (preparatory groups) and relevant leading organs in various places also strengthened the leadership of cotton purchasing work, determined to grasp it tightly and see it through, and rely on the masses to crack down on speculators, ensuring the smooth progress of cotton purchasing.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the vast tobacco-producing areas of our country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, grasped revolution, and vigorously promoted production. This year's cured tobacco has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are filled with the joy of harvest, picking and curing meticulously, and enthusiastically delivering high-quality tobacco to the state. By the beginning of October, the amount of cured tobacco purchased nationwide has increased by 15.4 percent compared to the same period last year, which was also a bumper harvest year. The quality of cured tobacco in most regions has also improved compared to last year.

    用实际行动支援无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设
    我国产棉产烟区社员踊跃交售好棉好烟
    全国到九月底收购的棉花和十月上旬收购的烤烟，比丰收的去年同期分别增长百分之八点七和百分之十五点四
    据新华社讯　我国南北棉区的广大社员和革命干部，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的教导，正以冲天的干劲，掀起采摘、交售新棉的高潮。成千上万个收购站前，终日人欢马叫，锣鼓喧天。一批批社员高举毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，赶着满载洁白棉花的大车，敲锣打鼓地庆祝今年棉花丰收，向国家交售新棉。
    广大棉区的社员和革命干部，一致表示：我们决不辜负毛主席的期望，决心作到精收细摘，向国家多交售棉花、交售优质棉花，用实际行动支援无产阶级文化大革命，支援国家社会主义建设，支援世界革命。
    今年的棉花收购，除个别产棉区外，普遍是从八月中旬开始的，比去年提前十天左右。棉花收购进度快，集中量大，是新中国成立以来少有的新气象。到九月底，全国已经收购的棉花比丰收的去年同期增长百分之八点七，其中江苏、浙江、上海、山东、河北、山西、河南、陕西、四川、北京等省、市，收购量比去年同期有较大的增长。十个省市合计，收购的棉花比去年同期多百分之四十三。棉花质量也比去年好。这是各地广大社员和革命干部以及收购战线上的广大革命职工，在文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持“抓革命，促生产”的结果，是解放军支援农业的结果，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    今年以来，随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，我国广大棉区的社员和革命干部，高举革命的批判旗帜，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，运用各种不同的形式，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论，进行了深入的大揭发、大批判。革命的大批判，大大提高了广大社员和革命干部的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性。他们遵照毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的指示，发扬“为革命种田”的精神，战胜了干旱、虫害、冰雹等自然灾害，夺取了棉花大丰收。
    新棉上市后，国务院、中央军委从各有关部门抽调无产阶级革命派和革命干部组成“抓革命，促生产”棉花小组，分赴全国各重点产棉县工作。各地革命委员会（筹备小组）和有关领导机关，也加强了对棉花收购工作的领导，决心抓紧抓好，一抓到底，并且依靠群众，打击投机倒把分子，保证棉花收购工作。
    据新华社二十一日讯　我国广大烤烟产区的贫下中农和革命干部，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，今年的烤烟取得了前所未有的大丰收。现在，广大贫下中农和革命干部正满怀丰收的喜悦，精收细烤，踊跃向国家交售好烟。到十月上旬，全国已经收购的烤烟，比丰收的去年同期增长百分之十五点四。大部分地区烤烟质量也比去年提高。
