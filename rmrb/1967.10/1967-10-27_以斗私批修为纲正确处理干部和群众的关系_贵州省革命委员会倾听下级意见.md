Under the great call of Chairman Mao to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held a meeting of all its members. The committee humbly listened to the opinions of members from the front lines of struggle and of some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, improved its work, and correctly handled relations between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses.

The meeting first seriously studied and discussed the series of extremely important instructions Chairman Mao gave during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China. It also seriously summarized the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement, combined with the actual situation in the province, and formulated specific measures to carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. During the meeting, the Standing Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "summing up achievements, correcting mistakes, and preparing for future battles," used the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Members from the front lines of struggle in various parts of the province and leaders of mass organizations spoke frankly about the work of the Standing Committee and the work style of each member, offering well-intentioned criticism and suggestions. The Standing Committee specially held a meeting to seriously study everyone's criticism and suggestions and immediately formulated specific measures to improve its work.

After the meeting, the members of the Standing Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee took immediate action and went deep into the masses. On one hand, they read Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word to the broad masses, and on the other hand, they listened to the criticisms and suggestions of various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary masses, learned from the masses, and asked the masses for advice, becoming small students of the masses. The chairman of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Li Zaihan, and the deputy chairman, Zhang Ming, went to Huishui County, while the deputy chairman, Liu Anmin, went to the most remote Xingyi County. Other members of the Standing Committee also went to factories, rural areas, schools, and other grassroots units, leaving only one-fifth of the personnel at the Provincial Revolutionary Committee to handle daily work.
