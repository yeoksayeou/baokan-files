Chinese Embassy in Vietnam Chargé d'Affaires Hosts Grand National Day Reception
Chinese People Fully Support Vietnamese People in Completely Defeating American Imperialism
Prime Minister Pham Van Dong Wishes Chinese People Greater Achievements in the Cultural Revolution

Hanoi, October 1 (New China News Agency) — Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Vietnam, Lu Weizhao, hosted a grand reception on September 29 to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Attendees included Vietnamese Party and government leaders and department heads such as Pham Van Dong, Pham Hung, Nguyen Duy Trinh, Phan Khoi, Vo Nguyen Giap, Le Van Luong, Hoang Van Hoan, and Truong Chinh. Representatives from various people's organizations, as well as war heroes and labor models, also attended. The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, headed by Nguyen Van Tien, was also present. Several foreign diplomats stationed in Vietnam were also invited.

The delegation led by Yang Dezhi, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a member of the National Defense Council, and the Chinese Journalists Delegation also attended the reception.

In his speech, Lu Weizhao reviewed the great achievements of the Chinese people in the 18 years since the founding of the nation, especially in the past year and a half of the Cultural Revolution. Lu Weizhao pointed out that after more than a year of unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the current revolutionary situation in China is excellent and will continue to improve. Our great motherland has never been so prosperous and flourishing, our people have never been so spirited and full of fighting spirit, and our national defense has never been so strong. He said that all these achievements and victories are the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which shines brightly. He said that all revolutionary people around the world deeply respect and love Chairman Mao and sincerely believe in Mao Zedong Thought. All revolutionary people around the world are learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, determined to follow the path of the Chinese revolution, which has become an irresistible historical trend.

Lu Weizhao pointed out that U.S.-led imperialism, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and reactionaries in various countries are terrified and hateful of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. They have formed an anti-China "holy alliance" and launched wave after wave of anti-China campaigns, but these will not harm us in the slightest. On the contrary, all kinds of anti-China clowns will eventually be spat upon by the people and eliminated by history. They will not have a good ending.

In his speech, Lu Weizhao highly praised the heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, for achieving one brilliant victory after another in the great war of resistance against American aggression. He expressed his firm belief that the heroic Vietnamese people are not afraid and cannot be deceived. The Vietnamese people will smash all the enemy's plots and tricks, overcome all difficulties, and fight the war of resistance against American aggression to the end. The final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people who dare to fight and dare to win.

Lu Weizhao reiterated in his speech that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. They are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people and completely defeat the American aggressors.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong spoke at the reception. He first, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese people, extended their warmest holiday greetings to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the brotherly Chinese people. He said that over the past 18 years, the heroic Chinese people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, have carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions, the spirit of labor and creation, self-reliance, and striving for progress. They have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong emphasized: "The Vietnamese people are extremely happy and excited about the series of brilliant victories achieved by the brotherly Chinese people and sincerely wish the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, greater and greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction and the proletarian cultural revolution."

In his speech, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong warmly praised the fraternal and fighting friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of Vietnam and China. He said: "The friendship between our two parties and two peoples is a comradely friendship, a fraternal friendship of sharing joys and sorrows, and sharing weal and woe in the revolutionary struggle. This friendship has been increasingly consolidated and developed on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism." He said: "During the years of fighting against French colonialism, in the socialist construction in North Vietnam, and in today's fierce struggle of resistance against American aggression, our people have always received the great and sincere sympathy and support of the brotherly Chinese people."

He said: "The recent economic and technical agreement signed in Beijing, where China provides aid to Vietnam without compensation, is a brilliant manifestation of the brotherly Chinese people's increasingly great and multifaceted support for our people. The great and precious support and help from the Chinese people are a powerful encouragement to our entire military and people, which further strengthens our confidence in the just struggle for victory." He said: "For the interests of the two peoples of our two countries, for the interests of peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism, the Vietnamese Party, government, and people are willing to make the greatest efforts to consolidate and strengthen the fraternal friendship and fighting unity between the two countries of Vietnam and China."

When talking about the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the current struggle of resistance against American aggression and their determination to defeat American imperialist aggressors, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said: "The Vietnamese people are determined to carry out Comrade Ho Chi Minh's solemn call on July 17, 1966." He said: "We are unwavering in our resolve to persist in the long and arduous but definitely victorious war of resistance against the American aggressors to defend the North, liberate the South, and ultimately achieve the peaceful reunification of the country."

The reception was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The hosts and guests frequently toasted to the unity and great friendship between the peoples of the two countries, to the health and longevity of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Comrade Ho Chi Minh.

    我驻越使馆临时代办举行盛大国庆招待会
    中国人民全力支援越南人民彻底打败美帝
    范文同总理祝愿中国人民在文化大革命中取得更大成就
    新华社河内三十日电　中国驻越南大使馆临时代办陆维钊二十九日晚举行盛大招待会，隆重庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    应邀出席招待会的有，越南党和政府领导人以及各部门负责人范文同、范雄、阮维桢、潘继遂、文进勇、黎文良、黄国越、春水等，还有各人民群众团体负责人，以及战斗英雄和劳动模范等。越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进也出席了招待会。应邀出席招待会的还有一些国家驻越南的外交使节。
    由中共中央委员、国防委员会委员杨得志率领的中越友好协会代表团，中国新闻工作者代表团也出席了招待会。
    陆维钊代办在讲话中概述了中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在建国十八年中，特别是在最近一年多的文化大革命运动中所取得的伟大成就。陆维钊指出，经过一年多史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，中国目前的革命形势好得很，而且将越来越好。我们伟大的祖国，从来没有这样繁荣昌盛，我国人民从来没有这样意气风发，斗志昂扬，我们的国防，从来没有这样强大。他指出，这一切成就，一切胜利，都是在中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他说，全世界革命人民无比崇敬和爱戴毛主席，无比真诚地信仰毛泽东思想。全世界革命人民学习和运用毛泽东思想，决心走中国革命的道路，已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。陆维钊代办指出，但是以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对中国无产阶级文化大革命，却怕得要死，恨得要命。它们结成反华“神圣同盟”，掀起了一阵阵反华浪潮，但这些绝对损害不了我们半根毫毛。相反，形形色色的反华小丑们，终究要被人民所唾弃，被历史所淘汰。他们是决不会有好下场的。
    陆维钊在讲话中高度赞扬英雄的越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导下，在伟大的抗美救国战争中所取得的一个又一个的辉煌胜利。他表示坚信：英雄的越南人民是吓不倒、骗不了的。越南人民必将粉碎敌人的种种阴谋诡计，克服一切困难，将抗美救国战争进行到底。最后胜利一定属于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的越南人民。
    陆维钊在讲话中重申，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，决心同兄弟的越南人民并肩战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    范文同总理在招待会上讲了话。他首先代表越南劳动党中央委员会、越南政府和越南人民向中国共产党中央委员会、中国政府和兄弟的中国人民表示最亲切的节日祝贺。他说，十八年来，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的中国人民，在中国共产党的正确领导下，发扬了光荣的革命传统、劳动创造智慧、自力更生、奋发图强的精神，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中连续取得了许多辉煌的成就。
    范文同总理强调说：“越南人民为兄弟的中国人民取得一系列辉煌的胜利感到无比的欢欣鼓舞和满怀兴奋，并且衷心地祝愿中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命事业中取得更多巨大的成就。”范文同总理在讲话中，热情地颂扬越中两党和两国人民之间兄弟般的、战斗的情谊。他说：“我们两党、两国人民之间的情谊是同志的情谊，是亲如唇齿相依、在革命斗争中同甘苦、共患难的兄弟情谊。这种情谊是在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上日益巩固和发展起来的。”他说：“在反对法国殖民主义者的抗战年代里，在越南北方进行社会主义建设事业中，以及在今天抗美救国的火热斗争中，我国人民一贯得到兄弟的中国人民巨大和真诚的同情与支援。”
    他说：“最近在北京签订的中国无偿地援助越南的经济技术协定，是兄弟的中国人民对我国人民作出日益巨大的和多方面的援助的光辉表现。中国人民的巨大和宝贵的支持和帮助对我们全国军民是强有力的鼓舞，这就愈益加强我们对正义的必胜的斗争的信心。”他说：“为了我们两国人民的利益，为了和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义事业的利益，越南党、政府和人民愿意不断为巩固和加强越中两国之间的兄弟友谊和战斗团结作出最大的努力。”
    在谈到越南人民在目前的抗美救国斗争中取得的巨大胜利和他们战胜美帝国主义侵略强盗的决心时，范文同总理说：“越南人民誓以钢铁般的决心实现胡志明主席在一九六六年七月十七日的庄严号召。”他说：“我们矢志不移地要把长期和艰苦但一定能打败美国侵略强盗的正义战争坚持到底，以保卫北方，解放南方，进而和平统一祖国。”
    招待会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。宾主双方频频为越中两国人民之间的团结和伟大友谊，为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和越南人民的伟大领袖胡主席的健康长寿干杯。
