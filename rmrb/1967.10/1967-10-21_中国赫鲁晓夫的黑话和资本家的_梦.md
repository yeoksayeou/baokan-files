In April 1949, China's Khrushchev fled to Tianjin and peddled capitalist goods. He convened a meeting with the major capitalists from factories such as Qixin, Jiuda, Dongya, and Renli, revealing his true intentions and encouraging them to exploit more, saying, "The more you exploit, the greater your merit." He brazenly claimed, "The more you exploit, the better it is for the country and the people. Everyone agrees."

Who agrees with more exploitation? The working class does not agree! The laboring people do not agree! The Communist Party does not agree! Yet China's Khrushchev insists, "Everyone agrees." In reality, only he and the capitalists agree.

Indeed, this is the case. After hearing China's Khrushchev's speech, many unscrupulous capitalists in Tianjin felt "comfortable in their hearts" and saw "new hope and new life." Thus, the capitalist Song Qiying of Dongya revived his dream from 1947, brazenly proposing a plan to develop capitalism—"My Dream." In May of that year, the capitalists of Renli registered with the People's Bank, using forty million dollars deposited abroad to engage in large-scale import business, and built a relatively large Renli Egg Products Factory, renovating the Beijing Renli Sack Factory. In just two or three years, Renli Industrial Company, which originally produced only wool and carpets, developed into a comprehensive company producing wool, carpets, egg powder, sacks, and engaging in import-export business. By 1951, Renli's profits had increased to three times that of 1948. This was the so-called "golden age" that capitalists longed for and yearned for under the instigation of China's Khrushchev.

Does the capitalist's exploitation benefit the country? Does it benefit the people? No, this is all nonsense. Look at the facts.

Renli Wool Factory shifted from producing apparel wool to industrial wool, not for the country's industrial construction, but to make more money! At national procurement meetings, capitalists often used methods such as increasing costs and demanding higher profit margins to extort higher prices from the state. For example, in producing duvet covers for papermaking, capitalists were not satisfied with a profit margin of 25% to 30%, insisting on a maximum profit margin of 40%. After accepting the orders, they used methods such as substituting inferior materials for superior ones and reducing the density of the weave to cut corners, reducing the lifespan of the papermaking duvet covers. The result was that the capitalists made money, while the state and the people's interests were harmed. What benefit does the capitalist's exploitation bring to the country and the people?!

Marx said: "Capital comes into the world dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt."

The capitalist's profits are the blood and sweat of our working class! Yet China's Khrushchev says, "Exploitation is meritorious." We ask: Where is the "merit"? Is it meritorious to eat the flesh and drink the blood of workers, to harm the state? We, the working class, firmly oppose exploitation! We must forever eliminate exploitation!

    中国赫鲁晓夫的黑话和资本家的“梦”
    一九四九年四月中国赫鲁晓夫跑到天津，贩卖资本主义的私货。他召集了启新、久大、东亚、仁立等厂的大资本家座谈，向他们交“底”，鼓励他们多剥削，胡说什么：“剥削的越多，功劳越大”，“你们有本事多剥削，对国家对人民都有利，大家都赞成。”
    谁赞成多剥削？工人阶级不赞成！劳动人民不赞成！共产党不赞成！可是中国赫鲁晓夫硬说：“大家都赞成”。其实只有他和资本家赞成。
    事实正是这样。听了中国赫鲁晓夫的讲话，天津的许多不法资本家都心领神会。他们象扎了吗啡针一样感到“心里舒服”，“有了新的希望和新的生命”。于是东亚的资本家宋棐卿又重温了他一九四七年的旧梦，猖狂地抛出了发展资本主义的罪恶计划——“我的梦”。在同年五月，仁立的资本家就向人民银行登记，用存在国外的四十万美元大做进口生意，并新建了规模较大的仁立蛋品厂，改建了北京仁立麻袋厂。在短短两三年的时间内，仁立实业公司在原来单纯生产毛呢和地毯的基础上，发展成生产毛呢、地毯、蛋粉、麻袋并兼营进出口业务的综合性大公司。仁立的资本家一九五一年的利润就增加到一九四八年的三倍。这就是在中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹下，资本家们一直留恋、向往的所谓“黄金时代”。
    资本家的剥削，对国家有利吗？对人民有利吗？不，这完全是胡说八道。请看事实。
    仁立毛呢厂由生产服装呢转向生产工业呢，不是为了国家的工业建设，而是为了多赚钱！在国家的订货会议上，资本家常用抬高成本，多争利润率的办法向国家讨高价。如生产造纸用的套毯，资本家不满足于百分之二十五到百分之三十的利润，硬要争百分之四十的最高利润。而在接受订货之后，他们又采用在原料上以次顶好，在织造上减少纬密等办法，偷工减料，降低了造纸呢的使用寿命。结果是资本家发了财，国家和人民的利益受了损害。资本家多剥削，对国家、对人民有什么利？！
    马克思说：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”
    资本家的利润，就是我们工人阶级的血和汗！可是中国赫鲁晓夫说什么“剥削有功”。我们要问：“功”在那里？难道吃工人的肉，喝工人的血，坑害国家，就是资本家的“功劳”吗？！我们工人阶级坚决反对剥削！要永远消灭剥削！
