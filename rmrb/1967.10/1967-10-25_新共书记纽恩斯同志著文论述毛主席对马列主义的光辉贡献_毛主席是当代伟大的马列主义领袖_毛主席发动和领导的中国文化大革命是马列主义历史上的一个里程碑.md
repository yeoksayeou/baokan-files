New Zealand Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Ray Neunz has published a lengthy article in the August and September issues of the party's journal, "Communist Review," discussing Chairman Mao's brilliant contributions to Marxism-Leninism theory. The article states: Chairman Mao's achievements in theory and as the true leader of the contemporary international communist movement place him among the greatest figures in the history of Marxism-Leninism and revolution. The article praises Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, pointing out: "The question of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism is a matter of decisive significance for the entire future of the proletarian revolution." Chairman Mao's solution to this problem "is a milestone in the history of Marxism-Leninism."

In his article titled "Some Aspects of Mao Zedong's Contributions to Marxism-Leninism Theory," Neunz first points out: Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were not only theoreticians but also activists and leaders of the international proletarian revolutionary movement. "Marx and Engels were the founders of scientific socialism theory and the leaders of the workers' revolutionary movement during the period of capitalist development," and "Leninism, as Stalin said, is 'Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.'"

The article then emphasizes: In the new era in which we live, Chairman Mao has defended and further developed Marxism. Mao Zedong Thought, as pointed out by the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is "Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards worldwide victory."

The article states: "Chairman Mao possesses the abilities of a brilliant theoretician and a great practical leader, thus playing the role of a great Marxist-Leninist leader. His many theoretical works on solving the problems of the Chinese revolution are universally applicable."

The article devotes a large section to discussing Chairman Mao's contributions to Marxist philosophy. The article believes that in "On Contradiction," Chairman Mao expounded on the law of contradiction as the fundamental law of dialectics, which is the most important development of Marxist philosophy and a new contribution to Marxism-Leninism. The article states that one of Chairman Mao's great merits is that he deeply developed Lenin's viewpoint, proposing the theory of antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions and their mutual transformation, which shows how profoundly and thoroughly he has mastered dialectics.

The article believes that based on Chairman Mao's theory, the essence of the splits in the international communist movement can be more deeply understood. The article points out: Starting with Khrushchev, the Soviet revisionist leadership, under the slogans of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful transition," betrayed the international communist movement and aligned with U.S. imperialism, thus transforming the non-antagonistic contradictions within the international communist movement into antagonistic contradictions. The Soviet revisionists and their followers, in order to align with U.S. imperialism, have sold out anti-imperialist movements around the world, particularly openly opposing and attacking the socialist countries of China and Albania. Therefore, Marxist-Leninists "cannot take 'joint action' with the Soviet (revisionist leadership) in Vietnam, because this action will not be against U.S. imperialism, but in support of U.S. imperialism."

The article points out that Chairman Mao's exposition on the particularity of contradictions and their research methods has opened up new theoretical ground. The article states that Chairman Mao's theory on the principal contradiction and the principal aspect of the contradiction has made a truly new and significant development in Marxist philosophy.

The article then points out that Chairman Mao was the first to introduce Marxist epistemology to the masses. In "On Practice," he not only systematically expounded on the main features of Marxist epistemology in a way that is easy for people to understand, providing the most complete exposition to date on the two stages of epistemology—sensory cognition and rational cognition—but also made new creations. Chairman Mao used the viewpoint of Marxist epistemology to explain the root causes of dogmatism and empiricism in revolutionary practice. Chairman Mao's teachings in this regard are universally applicable. Chairman Mao showed the masses that understanding Marxist epistemology can help their practical work, thereby helping to promote the revolution.

The article states: "The reason why Mao Zedong Thought is so strongly emphasized in China and the international Marxist-Leninist movement is to promote the masses' grasp of the entire Marxism-Leninism, thereby turning theory into material force."

Neunz's article discusses Chairman Mao's great contributions in opposing the traitors of the contemporary international communist movement. The article believes that because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has long been considered the center of revolutionary leadership, the task of fighting against modern Soviet revisionism is even more arduous than Lenin's fight against the Second International revisionists. "The immortal merit of Mao Zedong and the Chinese communists lies in the fact that they not only undertook the arduous task of exposing this revisionism and fighting against it but also gloriously carried out this task."

The article points out that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, in refuting the "three reconciliations" and "two integrations" line of Khrushchev revisionism, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, "using a general line based on Marxism-Leninism to oppose the revisionist general line (of the Khrushchev group)."

The article states that "On the General Line of the International Communist Movement" and the nine commentaries by the Communist Party of China in response to the open letter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union can be regarded as works representing Mao Zedong Thought. They "brilliantly defend revolutionary Marxism-Leninism and are a further major development in the theory of Marxism-Leninism under contemporary conditions."

The article praises Chairman Mao's extremely important contributions in the strategic and tactical thinking of the anti-imperialist struggle. The article states that Chairman Mao's brilliant proposition of "strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously" is "a new development of Marxism-Leninism and a very valuable guide for revolutionaries." Chairman Mao's viewpoint that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is a further development of Lenin's "colossus with feet of clay" proposition and is "an important weapon of today's Marxism-Leninism."

The article also points out: Chairman Mao proposed to fight imperialism head-on, a thought based on the experience of the Chinese people in their long and arduous revolutionary struggle. This is a universally applicable thought and another important contribution of Chairman Mao to Marxism-Leninism theory. In contrast, modern revisionists advocate surrendering to U.S. imperialism. The article sharply exposes the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's surrender to U.S. imperialism in the 1962 Caribbean crisis and the Vietnam issue.

The article also mentions that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China proposed that the current focus of world contradictions is in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the main regions of the world revolutionary storm. The article praises Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside and the thought of his close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao in the article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," which clearly proposes that the "world's countryside" should surround the "world's cities." The article believes that these propositions "are based on a concrete study of the current situation from the perspective of dialectical materialism" and "have universal strategic and tactical significance."

The article points out that Chairman Mao's correct Marxist-Leninist thoughts have an important mobilizing force for the people in the center of the world revolutionary storm, while the Soviet revisionist leaders oppose these brilliant propositions because they are afraid of U.S. imperialism and want to cooperate with it.

Next, Neunz's article discusses in detail Chairman Mao's historically significant development of Marxism-Leninism on the issues of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship under the socialist system. The article points out: Based on the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Chairman Mao further creatively developed the basic doctrines of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is "the first Marxist work to comprehensively and systematically expound on the contradictions and class struggle in socialist society." "This is one of the important lessons Chairman Mao drew from the formation and development of Soviet revisionism."

The article believes that Chairman Mao's theory and policies to prevent the restoration of capitalism are "a great defense and development of the Marxism-Leninism doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat." The article emphasizes that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China "is an important historical experience in completing the tasks necessary to prevent the restoration of capitalism," "is a special form of the major development of Chairman Mao's theory of ensuring the socialist road over the capitalist road," and "is the greatest example in history of the people's ideological transformation." The article points out that the main content of this unprecedented cultural revolution, including its long-term and immediate tasks, has universal significance.

The article states: Chairman Mao's development of the Marxism-Leninism doctrine of socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat is also a powerful weapon for restoring socialism in places where revisionism has usurped power. Therefore, "it will inevitably arouse the strongest hatred and criticism from Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk. However, for Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries, this is not a bad thing but rather a proof of the fundamental correctness of this doctrine."

In discussing Chairman Mao's theory on the establishment of Marxist-Leninist parties, the article points out: In this regard, "the experience of China is highly educational for Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries around the world." "In fact, today, if one does not pay extremely close attention to Chairman Mao's teachings on the party, one cannot be a Marxist-Leninist." The article discusses Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and states that Chairman Mao's mass line thought "was formed and tested in the many years of revolutionary struggle of the Communist Party of China" and "is universally applicable, hence a weapon in the hands of all Marxist-Leninists around the world."

The article also praises Chairman Mao's emphasis on the thought of serving the people and points out that the principle of ideological transformation based on the thought of serving the people "greatly enriches Marxism-Leninism theory" and "its application in the cultural revolution is bringing many new enlightenments to Marxist-Leninists."

    新共书记纽恩斯同志著文论述毛主席对马列主义的光辉贡献
    毛主席是当代伟大的马列主义领袖
    毛主席发动和领导的中国文化大革命是马列主义历史上的一个里程碑
    新华社二十四日讯  新西兰共产党全国委员会书记处书记雷·纽恩斯同志在新西兰共产党党刊《共产主义评论》今年八月和九月的两期上发表长篇文章，论述毛主席对马克思列宁主义理论所作的光辉贡献。文章指出：毛主席在理论方面和作为当代真正的世界共产主义运动的领袖所取得的成就，使他居于马克思列宁主义和革命历史的最伟大的人物之列。文章欢呼毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，并且指出：“确保无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的问题，是关系到无产阶级革命整个前途的具有决定意义的问题”，毛主席对这一问题的解决“是马克思列宁主义历史上的一个里程碑”。
    纽恩斯同志在题为《毛泽东对马克思列宁主义理论所作的贡献的一些方面》的文章中首先指出：马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林，都不仅是理论家，而且是活动家，是国际工人阶级革命运动的领袖。“马克思和恩格斯是科学社会主义理论的创始人，是资本主义发展时期工人阶级革命运动的领袖”，“列宁主义，正如斯大林所说的那样，是‘帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义’。”
    文章接着强调指出：在我们现在生活的新时代，毛主席捍卫和进一步发展了马克思主义。毛泽东思想，正如中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议所指出的，是“在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义”。
    文章说：“毛泽东兼备了一个光辉的理论家和一个伟大的实践领袖的能力，从而起了伟大的马克思列宁主义领袖的作用。”“他的许多关于解决中国革命问题的理论著作是普遍适用的。”
    文章以大量的篇幅论述了毛主席在马克思主义哲学方面的贡献。文章认为，毛主席在《矛盾论》中阐明了矛盾法则是辩证法的根本法则，这是对马克思主义哲学的最重要的发展，是对马克思列宁主义的新贡献。文章说，毛主席的巨大功勋之一，就是他深入地发展了列宁的论点，提出了对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾以及这二者互相转化的理论，这说明他多么深刻和彻底地掌握了辩证法。
    文章认为，根据毛主席的这一理论，可以更深刻地理解世界共产主义运动中分裂的实质。文章指出：从赫鲁晓夫开始，苏联修正主义领导集团在“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”和“和平过渡”的口号下，背叛国际共产主义运动，投靠美帝国主义，从而使国际共产主义运动中的非对抗性矛盾转化为对抗性矛盾。苏修及其追随者为了投靠美帝国主义而出卖世界各地的反帝运动，特别是公开敌视和反对社会主义的中国和阿尔巴尼亚这两个反帝堡垒。因此，马克思列宁主义者“不能在越南同苏联（修正主义领导集团）采取‘联合行动’，因为这个行动不会是反对美帝的，而是支持美帝的”。
    文章指出，毛主席对矛盾的特殊性及其研究方法的阐述，开创了新的理论阵地，毛主席关于主要矛盾和主要矛盾方面的理论，对马克思主义哲学作出了真正是新的、具有重要意义的发展。
    文章接着指出，毛主席是第一个把马克思主义认识论介绍给群众的人，他在《实践论》中不仅以人们容易了解的形式系统地阐明了马克思主义认识论的全部主要特点，就认识论的两个阶段——感性认识和理性认识——作了迄今为止最完整的阐述，而且有新的创造。毛主席用马克思主义认识论的观点说明了在革命实践中犯教条主义和经验主义错误的根源。毛主席在这方面的教导是普遍适用的。毛主席向群众表明，对马克思主义认识论的理解，可以帮助他们的实际工作，从而帮助推动革命。
    文章说：“在中国以及国际的马克思列宁主义运动中，所以十分强调学习毛泽东思想，就是为了促进人民群众掌握整个马克思列宁主义，从而使理论变成物质力量。”
    纽恩斯同志的文章谈到了毛主席在反对当代国际共产主义运动的叛徒方面所作出的伟大贡献。文章认为，由于苏联共产党长期被认为是革命领导的中心，对苏联现代修正主义进行斗争的任务，就比列宁对第二国际修正主义者的斗争还要艰巨得多。“毛泽东和中国共产党人的不朽功勋在于，他们不仅承担了揭露这个修正主义并同它作斗争的艰巨任务，而且光荣地把这个任务贯彻下去。”
    文章指出，以毛主席为首的中国共产党在驳斥赫鲁晓夫修正主义的“三和”、“两全”路线时，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，“用一条建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的革命的总路线来对抗（赫鲁晓夫集团的）修正主义总路线”。
    文章说，《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》和中国共产党答复苏联共产党《公开信》的九篇评论，可以看作是代表毛泽东思想的作品，它们“光辉地捍卫了革命的马克思列宁主义，是当代条件下（马克思列宁主义）理论方面的进一步重大发展”。
    文章颂扬毛主席在反帝斗争的战略和策略思想方面所作出的极为重要的贡献。文章说，毛主席提出的在战略上要藐视敌人、在战术上要重视敌人的英明论断，“是马克思列宁主义的一个新发展，是对革命者的非常宝贵的指导”。毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论点，是对列宁的“泥足巨人”提法的进一步发展，是“今天马克思列宁主义的一个重要武器”。
    文章还指出：毛主席提出要对帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，这个思想是根据中国人民在长期艰苦的革命斗争中的经验提出的，这是一个普遍适用的思想，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义理论的又一个重要贡献。与此相反，现代修正主义者则主张对美帝国主义投降。文章尖锐地揭露了苏修领导集团在一九六二年加勒比事件中以及在越南问题上投降美帝国主义的丑恶嘴脸。
    文章还谈到，以毛主席为首的中国共产党提出，当前世界矛盾的焦点是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲这些世界革命风暴的主要地区。文章赞扬毛主席关于农村包围城市的光辉思想和毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志在《人民战争胜利万岁》一文中明确提出的“世界的农村”包围“世界的城市”的思想。文章认为，这些论点
  “是以精通辩证唯物主义的观点对现时代情况作具体研究为基础的”，“具有普遍的重要的战略和策略意义”。
    文章指出，毛主席的正确的马克思列宁主义思想对于世界革命风暴中心的人民具有重要的动员力量，而苏修领导人所以反对这些英明论断，是因为他们害怕美帝国主义，要同美帝国主义合作。
    接着，纽恩斯同志的文章详细地论述了毛主席关于在社会主义制度下的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政问题上，对马克思列宁主义的具有历史意义的发展。文章指出：毛主席根据无产阶级专政的历史经验，进一步创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的基本学说。毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》是“全面、系统地阐述社会主义社会的矛盾和阶级斗争的第一部马克思主义著作”，“这是毛主席从苏联修正主义的形成和发展中吸取的重要教训之一。”
    文章认为，毛主席为防止资本主义复辟而提出的理论和政策是“对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说的极大的维护和发展”。文章着重指出，今天在中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命“是完成为防止资本主义复辟所必要的任务的一个重要历史经验”，“是中国运用毛主席关于保证社会主义道路战胜资本主义道路这一理论的重大发展的特殊形式”，“是历史上人民进行思想改造的最伟大的实例”。文章指出，这场史无前例的文化大革命的“主要内容，包括它的长远的和目前的任务，都具有普遍的意义”。
    文章说：毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于社会主义和无产阶级专政学说的发展，对于在修正主义篡夺了政权的地方恢复社会主义，也是一个强有力的武器。因此，“它也必然引起勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流的最强烈的仇恨和指责。但是，对马克思列宁主义者和革命者说来，这并不是坏事，倒是证明了这一学说的根本正确。”
    文章在谈到毛主席关于建立马克思列宁主义政党的理论时指出：在这方面，“中国的经验对于全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命者，是富有教育意义的。”“事实上，在今天，如果不极为密切地注意毛主席关于党的教导，就不能成为一个马克思列宁主义者。”文章论述了毛主席关于群众路线的教导，并且说，毛主席的群众路线思想“是在中国共产党许多年的革命斗争中形成和受到考验的”，“是放之四海而皆准的，因而是全世界马克思列宁主义者手中的一个武器”。
    文章还赞扬毛主席十分强调为人民服务的思想，并且指出，根据为人民服务的思想来进行思想改造的原则，“大大地丰富了马克思列宁主义理论”，“它在文化革命中的应用，正在为马克思列宁主义者带来许多新的教益”。
