This study class, based on the principle of "three-in-one combination," has formed study groups; throughout the study, the principle of educating and liberating oneself has been consistently upheld; political training and military training have been combined; internal and external efforts have been integrated to promote each other; and the policy of frugal management has been adhered to.

Editor's Note: The Party, government, and mass organizations at the provincial level in Qinghai, under the "August 18" Joint Committee, have established a Mao Zedong Thought study class in accordance with Chairman Mao's great instructions on "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." Their experiences have universal significance, and it is hoped that all regions and departments will pay attention to them.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, October 14th: The Party, government, and mass organizations at the provincial level in Qinghai, under the "August 18" Joint Committee, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, and opened a Mao Zedong Thought study class on October 5th, promoting the study in various units. The characteristics of this study class are:

1. The members of the study class are the main leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres who have come forward and those who are about to come forward, and PLA leftist support cadres. Based on the principle of "three-in-one combination," study groups have been formed. This facilitates mutual understanding, mutual assistance, and the development and consolidation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," as well as strengthening military-civilian relations.

2. Throughout the study, the principle of educating and liberating oneself has been consistently upheld. The study class uses the "Five Articles" ("On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Against Liberalism," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains") as the main tools for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, with group discussions as the main form. The focus is on identifying problems, solving problems, exposing "selfishness," and criticizing it. Everyone is both a teacher and a student. This method of study has been well received. The director of the "August 18" Joint Committee of the Party, government, and mass organizations at the provincial level, Lei Yuying, said: In the past, training classes required printed study materials and teachers, but the results were not good. This time, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions to educate ourselves. Everyone uses Mao Zedong Thought to criticize their past erroneous ideas, and the education received is particularly profound.

3. Political training and military training are combined. In addition to studying Chairman Mao's works and engaging in self-criticism, the Party, government, and mass organizations' study class also conducts one and a half hours of military training daily, mainly learning the organizational discipline and collective consciousness of the PLA. Everyone reflects that this study is a double harvest, both raising awareness and learning the style of the PLA. They all expressed their determination to learn the three-eight style of the PLA and implement it in their offices, turning their offices into revolutionary offices.

4. Internal and external efforts are integrated to promote each other. Revolutionary organization leaders participating in the study, in order to promote the study in their own units, use rest time or Sundays to return and introduce the situation of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, promoting the study in their own units. For example, the leaders of the "Red Flag Team" of the original Provincial Party Committee Organization Department and the "Red Rebel Corps" of the Office have introduced the study class situation to their units. The members heard and said, "We are lagging behind and need to catch up." To promote the study, some units have appointed full-time liaison officers to promptly convey the situation of the study class to their units and bring back the study situation and problems raised in their units, encouraging and promoting each other, so that both internal and external efforts have launched a high tide of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

5. The policy of frugal management is adhered to. The study class takes the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example and runs the school without spending money. In addition to bringing twenty sheets of paper and ten bottles of ink from their units as office supplies, they have not spent a single penny so far. All participants bring their own luggage. The study class of more than 110 people has no service personnel, and all work is done by the students themselves.

　　西宁地区毛泽东思想学习班办得好
    青海省级党政群系统“八·一八”联委会，坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，成立了毛泽东思想学习班。这个学习班，根据“三结合”原则编成学习小组；在学习中始终贯彻自己教育自己，自己解放自己的原则；将政治训练和军事训练结合起来；内外结合，互相促进；坚持勤俭办学的方针。
    编者按：青海省级党政群系统“八·一八”联委会，根据毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大指示，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们的经验具有普遍意义，希望各地区、各部门予以重视。
    新华社西宁十四日电　青海省级党政群系统“八·一八”联委会，坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，于十月五日开办了毛泽东思想学习班，推动了各单位的学习。这个学习班的特点是：
    一、学习班的成员，是革命群众组织主要负责人，已站出来的和将站出来的革命领导干部，解放军支左干部。根据“三结合”的原则编成学习小组，这样，便于互相了解，互相帮助，促进革命的“三结合”的发展和巩固，也密切了军民关系。
    二、学习中始终贯彻了自己教育自己，自己解放自己的原则。学习班以“老五篇”（《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》）为斗私批修的主要法宝，以小组讨论为主要形式，坚持自己提出问题，自己解决问题，自己亮出“私”字，自己去“批”。大家都是教员，大家又是学生。这样的学习，大家反映很好。省级党政群系统“八·一八”联委会主任雷玉英说：过去办的集训班，要印发学习材料，又要找教员，结果效果并不好。这次，我们就按毛主席指示办，自己教育自己，每个人都用毛泽东思想来批评自己过去的错误思想，受教育特别深刻。
    三、政治训练和军事训练相结合。党政群学习班，除学习毛主席著作和进行斗私批修外，每天还进行一个半小时的军事学习，主要是学习解放军的组织性、纪律性和整体观念。大家反映：这次学习是双丰收，既提高了觉悟，又学习了解放军的作风，都表示一定要把解放军的三八作风学到手，并贯彻到机关中去，把机关也办成革命化的机关。
    四、内外结合，互相促进。参加学习的革命组织负责人，为了推动本单位的学习，就利用休息时间或星期日，回去介绍毛泽东思想学习班情况，推动了本单位的学习。如原省委组织部“红旗队”、办公厅“红色造反队”等负责人，向本单位介绍学习班学习情况后，队员们一听都说：“我们落后了，要赶上去。”为了推动学习，有的单位设了专任联络员，把学习班的情况及时传达给本单位，又把本单位的学习情况和学习中提出的问题带回来，互相鼓励，互相促进，使内外都掀起了斗私批修的高潮。
    五、坚持勤俭办学的方针。学习班以抗大为榜样，不花钱办学校。他们除从本单位带来二十张白纸和十瓶墨汁作为办公用具以外，到现在没花一文钱。参加学习的全体同志，都是自己带行李。一百一十多人的学习班，没有一个服务人员，一切工作都是学员自己动手。
