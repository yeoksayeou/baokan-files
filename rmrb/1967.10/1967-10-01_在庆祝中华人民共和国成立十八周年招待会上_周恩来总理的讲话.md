At the reception celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the following speech:

Honorable guests, comrades, and friends:

At this moment, when our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved further victories, our comrades in the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat and representatives of various sectors of the people have the opportunity to gather with distinguished guests from many countries on five continents to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We feel immense joy and excitement.

Attending tonight's reception are the delegation from the Albanian Party and government, led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu, from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle; the delegation from the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Party and government, led by Comrades Le Duan and Hoang Van Hoan, and the delegation from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, led by Comrade Nguyen Van Thieu, from the front lines of the armed struggle against the United States; the delegation from the National Revolutionary Movement and government of the Congo (Brazzaville), led by His Excellency Alphonse Massemba-Debat, the friendly delegation from Tanzania, led by His Excellency Babu, and Mr. Diallo from Mali, from the front lines of the anti-imperialist struggle in Africa; the friendly delegation from the government of our close neighbor Pakistan, led by His Excellency Zulfikar Ali Bhutto; representatives from Marxist-Leninist parties of various countries; and many friendly delegations from various countries in the fields of politics, military, economy, culture, and civil society, as well as prominent figures from various sectors. The presence of the distinguished guests from various countries is a great support and encouragement to the Chinese people. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to you all!

Comrades and friends! Our great motherland is facing a very good situation.

Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has truly mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. The great thought of Mao Zedong has been widely propagated on an unprecedented scale, and the spiritual face of the people across the nation has undergone tremendous changes. The handful of top-ranking capitalist-roaders within the Party have been exposed and are now undergoing thorough criticism. The dictatorship of the proletariat in our country has been further consolidated. In accordance with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the policy of "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism," a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is currently sweeping the nation.

"Revolution is the locomotive of history." Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" has inspired the boundless enthusiasm of the broad masses of laboring people, and the cause of socialist construction in our country will surely achieve new leaps and bounds.

At present, the situation in the world is also very good.

The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are expanding and growing stronger. Heroic Albania, standing at the forefront of the anti-revisionist struggle, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also developing. More and more countries are igniting the flames of people's armed struggle. The heroic Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation is achieving splendid victories. The anti-imperialist tide in the Arab and African regions continues to rise. In the United States, an unprecedented scale of armed resistance by Black people has erupted. American imperialism is in trouble both at home and abroad, and its days are not good. The traitorous faces of modern revisionists are increasingly exposed, and their days are also not good. They are hastily colluding and rallying some accomplices, attempting to stir up a new anti-China reverse current in order to divide and extinguish the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries and save their dying fate. These gentlemen are completely counting on luck. The seven hundred million Chinese people are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The historical tide of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world will not be stopped by any force. The conspiracies of American imperialism and modern revisionism to be anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolution will only result in their lifting stones to drop on their own feet, accelerating their failure.

Comrades and friends! Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Strive hard, build a great socialist country, and help the broad oppressed and exploited peoples of the world to fulfill our great internationalist duty." After this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, will surely be able to better implement the general line of our foreign policy and more effectively fulfill our great internationalist duty. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation until final victory. We firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. We must unite all Marxist-Leninists in the world, unite all revolutionary peoples in the world, unite all oppressed peoples and nations, unite all anti-imperialist forces that can be united, form the broadest united front against American imperialism, carry the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys through to the end, carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end, and continue to advance the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world and the international proletariat!

Now, I propose a toast:

To the great unity of all nationalities in our country,
To the great unity of the peoples of the world,
To new victories in the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people and the peoples of various countries against American imperialism,
To new victories in the revolutionary liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world,
To new victories in our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
To the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong,
To the long life of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao,
To the health of the distinguished guests from Albania, the Congo (Brazzaville), Vietnam, Pakistan, Tanzania, Mali, and other countries,
To the health of comrades and friends from various countries,
To the health of the diplomats and their spouses,
To the health of all compatriots and comrades present,

Cheers!

    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年招待会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社三十日讯　周恩来总理在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年招待会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的各位来宾，同志们，朋友们：
    正当我国无产阶级文化大革命取得进一步胜利的时候，我国无产阶级革命派的战友们和各界人民代表们，有机会同来自五大洲许多国家的贵宾们欢聚一堂，共庆中华人民共和国成立十八周年，我们感到无比的兴奋和愉快。
    出席今晚招待会的，有来自反帝反修斗争前线的以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团；有来自反美武装斗争前线的以黎清毅同志、黄文欢同志为首的越南民主共和国党政代表团和以黄文旦同志为首的越南南方民族解放阵线代表团；有来自非洲反帝斗争前线的以努马扎莱阁下为首的刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团，以巴布阁下为首的坦桑尼亚友好代表团和马里的迪亚洛阁下；有来自我们亲密邻邦以夏哈布丁阁下为首的巴基斯坦政府友好代表团；有各国马列主义的兄弟党的代表；还有各国的许多政治、军事、经济、文化和民间的友好代表团以及各方面的知名人士。各国贵宾们的光临，是对中国人民的极大支持和鼓舞。我现在代表我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向你们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢！
    同志们，朋友们！我们伟大的祖国面临着一片大好形势。
    一年多来，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经把亿万革命群众真正发动起来。伟大的毛泽东思想得到了空前未有的大普及，全国人民的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，已经被揭发出来，正在受到彻底批判。我国的无产阶级专政进一步得到巩固。按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，在“斗私、批修”方针的指引下，目前正在全国范围内掀起一个革命大批判、革命大联合、革命“三结合”的新高潮。
    “革命是历史的火车头”。毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召激发了广大劳动人民的冲天干劲，我国社会主义建设事业必将得到新的飞跃的发展。
    当前，全世界也是一片大好形势。
    马克思列宁主义的队伍正在发展壮大。英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚站在反修斗争的最前线，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。世界人民特别是亚非拉人民的革命运动也在发展。越来越多的国家燃起了人民武装斗争的烈火。英雄的越南人民的抗美救国战争不断取得辉煌胜利。阿拉伯和非洲地区的反帝浪潮继续高涨。在美国国内，爆发了空前规模的黑人武装抗暴斗争。美帝国主义内外交困，日子很不好过。现代修正主义者的叛徒面貌日益暴露，日子也很不好过。他们正在加紧勾结，并且纠集一些伙伴，妄图掀起一股新的反华逆流，以便分割和扑灭各国人民的革命斗争，挽救他们垂死的命运。这些先生们打的完全是如意算盘。七亿中国人民誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。亚非拉和全世界人民革命斗争的历史潮流，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。美帝国主义和现代修正主义反华、反共、反人民、反革命的阴谋，只会搬起石头打自己的脚，加速他们的失败。
    同志们，朋友们！我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“努力奋斗，建设一个社会主义的伟大强国，并且帮助世界被压迫被剥削的广大人民，完成我们应当担负的国际主义的伟大义务。”经过这次无产阶级文化大革命，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，一定能够更好地贯彻执行我国对外政策总路线，更有效地担负起我们的国际主义的伟大义务。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，一直到取得最后胜利。我们坚决支持亚非拉和世界各国人民的革命斗争。我们一定要团结全世界的马克思列宁主义者，团结全世界的革命人民，团结一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，团结一切可以团结的反帝力量，组成最广泛的反对美帝国主义的统一战线，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把世界人民和国际无产阶级的革命事业继续推向前进！
    现在，我提议：
    为我国各族人民的大团结，
    为全世界人民的大团结，
    为英雄的越南人民和各国人民反对美帝国主义斗争的新胜利，
    为亚非拉和世界各国人民革命解放事业的新胜利，
    为我国无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，
    为伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，
    为我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的万寿无疆，
    为阿尔巴尼亚、刚果（布）、越南、巴基斯坦、坦桑尼亚、马里和其他各国贵宾们的健康，
    为各国同志们、朋友们的健康，
    为各国使节和夫人们的健康，
    为所有在座的同胞们、同志们的健康，
    干杯！
