Since January this year, our troops stationed in Zhejiang have resolutely responded to the great call of Chairman Mao, the great leader, to "support the broad leftist masses." With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we have joined the 6409 unit and other brother units in firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province. We have steadfastly followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and striven bravely to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Self-revolution, break with selfishness, and establish public-mindedness, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao, who presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," pointed out: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution and also the primary question for the Cultural Revolution." When the army intervenes in the local Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it must first distinguish between friends and enemies and clarify the class lines to stand firm in the Cultural Revolution.

To stand firm in the Cultural Revolution, the fundamental requirement is to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to revolutionize oneself consciously, and to be good at learning, keeping up with the times in one's thinking.

The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great innovation in the communist movement. Before intervening in the local Cultural Revolution, many of our comrades did not understand this great revolution, feared chaos, feared problems, and were not accustomed to or adapted to the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's great teachings and serious understanding of Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions, combined with actual practice and self-examination, we realized that these thoughts are inconsistent with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of "daring to let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves"; they are the result of looking at problems from the standpoint of "selfishness." At the same time, we clearly recognized that to adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must consciously break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, with the greatest effort to learn new things and study new problems, and with the most resolute steps to follow the great leader Chairman Mao. The better we learn, the tighter we follow; the tighter we follow, the more consciously we learn. Thus, we caught up eagerly, and in the Party Committee and among leading cadres, we seriously organized the study and discussion of the instructions of Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and "quickly transmitted them to lower-level organizations and Party member masses," and immediately implemented them. In this way, we gradually changed the situation of not understanding and not being conscious.

To stand firm in the Cultural Revolution, we must also vigorously carry out education on the struggle between the two lines in the army, deeply engage in practical struggles, clarify class lines, and keep up in practice.

In the army, we carried out extensive education on the struggle between the two lines, extensively expounded the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and extensively expounded the great merits of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards. We made the cadres and soldiers understand the necessity and importance of the Cultural Revolution and clarified that only by believing in and relying on the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought can we carry out this great revolution well. We also selected and compiled big-character posters from the proletarian revolutionary masses for the platoons to read, invited Red Guards to give reports, and used methods such as presenting facts, listing crimes, exposing the true nature, and revealing harm to expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Through education, the broad cadres and soldiers were greatly inspired with a deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his bourgeois reactionary line; they deeply loved the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, greatly enhancing their class feelings for the proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards. This laid the political and ideological foundation for doing a good job in supporting the left.

We followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, in supporting the left, firmly established a strong sense of the masses and cultivated a style of deeply engaging with the masses and the actual situation. With full revolutionary enthusiasm and the attitude of "putting down airs and being humble students," we went to the front lines of struggle and to the masses to observe, listen, ask, and think, repeatedly conducting investigations and research. Through investigations and research, relying on the enthusiasm of the revolutionary youngsters, we gradually clarified the general direction of the struggles of various mass organizations and understood that the revolutionary mass organizations represented by the "Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters" have always directed their struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They are the genuine proletarian revolutionary masses. We and the brother units supporting the left decided to unite with them, fight with them, and achieve victory with them.

To stand firm in the Cultural Revolution, we must definitely put "public" first and "dare" to be at the forefront, tightly joining the proletarian revolutionary masses in shoulder-to-shoulder struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people is the sole purpose of this army." This is also the sole purpose of our work in supporting the left.

Supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses allows for no selfish motives; only selflessness can be fearless. Only by putting "public" first can we dare to be at the forefront and firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionary masses through thick and thin, united in struggle. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are terrified of the proletarian revolutionary masses and hate our firm support of the left to death. They spread rumors and slander everywhere, even inciting deceived masses to attack our cadres and soldiers, attempting to make us change our stance of supporting the left. We clearly recognized that in this fierce class struggle, "there is no room for compromise on the line." We educated the army to bring actual problems in supporting the left to the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, actively learning and applying "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party," and timely and repeatedly struggling with selfish and impure thoughts in our minds.

When the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road used various vicious means to attempt to suppress the proletarian revolutionary masses time and time again, we vowed to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, fearlessly, daring to take risks, and together with the brother units supporting the left and the proletarian revolutionary masses, we braved the winds and fought the waves. Wherever they attacked the proletarian revolutionary masses, we went there to support the proletarian revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought. We sent large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, schools, offices, and rural areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, inspire the masses, and help them firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, guiding them to learn and study Party policies. In this way, we defeated the evil plots of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road time and time again.

In the actual struggle of supporting the left, we deeply felt that Chairman Mao's great call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" is the fundamental policy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and also the fundamental policy for doing a good job in supporting the left. Only by fiercely struggling against "selfishness" and uprooting revisionism can we closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; only then can we have red hearts and bright eyes, clear class lines, firm feet, and straight butts, making the banner of supporting the left more brilliant; only then can we dare to be at the forefront, with the greatest courage and determination to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and wholeheartedly support the proletarian revolutionary masses.

Raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, said: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is commanded by our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief."

Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is the fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and it is also the fundamental attitude towards supporting the left.

To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must definitely raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, eliminate influences from the right and ultra-left, and firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle.

Since the Cultural Revolution is a revolution, it is inevitable that there will be resistance. Every step we take in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment has been a fierce struggle. When Comrade Chen Boda's article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" was published, the proletarian revolutionary masses launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters, initiating a high tide of revolutionary criticism, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, in order to save their doomed fate, used every means to disrupt our general direction of struggle, attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They not only disrupted from the right but also appeared in the guise of ultra-leftism, using petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist trends within the revolutionary ranks to sow discord, create divisions, and attempt to muddy the waters and lead the movement astray.

In this sharp and complex class struggle, we, together with the brother units supporting the left and the proletarian revolutionary masses, timely studied the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the Two Books by Tao Zhu," and Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech at the September 5 meeting of representatives from Anhui in Beijing, deeply understanding the great strategic significance of carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation. We further clarified that politically, ideologically, and theoretically overthrowing China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, thoroughly purging their counter-revolutionary revisionist poison, and using Mao Zedong Thought to carry out profound reforms in all fields is the theme and main task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is the general direction of our revolutionary struggle.

We, together with the brother units supporting the left, jointly held denunciation meetings to criticize China's Khrushchev, and sent large numbers of cadres and soldiers to the grassroots level, turning workshops, fields, schools, and streets into battlefields. Together with workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and the broad revolutionary masses, we used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, verbally and in writing, to expose and criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang. A magnificent "people's war" of revolutionary criticism surged forward, breaking through numerous obstacles and rapidly developing.

To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must also fiercely struggle against selfishness in criticizing revisionism, closely combining revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a kind of antidote. It not only expels the enemy's poison but also cleanses our own filth."

Carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." Through struggling against selfishness, we discard the selfish baggage on our backs and bravely join the battle of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation. At the same time, through struggling against selfishness, we consciously revolutionize, promote the ideological revolutionization of people, and truly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, ensuring that we always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

To further promote revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation, in response to the situation in revolutionary mass organizations where selfishness is not valued, factionalism comes first, and factions are at loggerheads, we, together with the brother units supporting the left and the proletarian revolutionary masses, vigorously organized the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, as well as relevant editorials and articles from the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. In various revolutionary mass organizations, following Chairman Mao's teaching to "carry out open, mass self-criticism (each side criticizes only itself, not the other side) and thoroughly correct it," we further exposed our thoughts, examined the harm, and further recognized that "selfishness" is the root cause of harming the unity of the revolutionary ranks and damaging the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary organization. We further understood that to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we must definitely struggle against selfishness in criticizing revisionism and thoroughly overthrow "selfishness."

We, together with the brother units supporting the left, also helped various revolutionary mass organizations to form leadership teams for criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation, studied specific measures, and gradually combined revolutionary criticism with the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit. The working class took the lead, rising up to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the industrial sector, and also linked the great criticism with the actual struggles of the past 18 years in their own factories and enterprises, raising the struggle-criticism-transformation of their own units to the level of the struggle between the two lines.

On the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of our country, Beijing sent us Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." This instruction greatly inspired the working class and the proletarian revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province, quickly forming a new high tide of achieving great unity in revolution. In the deepening development of revolutionary criticism, the proletarian party spirit was further enhanced, petty-bourgeois factionalism was overcome, deceived masses were educated and won over, and a large number of revolutionary cadres were liberated. Most factories, schools, offices, enterprises, and people's communes in suburban areas of Hangzhou achieved great unity in revolution under the premise of a unified general direction, further promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

In the struggle against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, strengthen the ideological construction of the revolutionary ranks.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our Party and state do not change color, we not only need the correct line and policy but also need to cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

In this great revolutionary struggle, arming the proletarian revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, cultivating and training a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is a matter of great importance for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years, and it is the most fundamental task of supporting the left.

The key to strengthening the ideological construction of the revolutionary ranks is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadres of revolutionary mass organizations.

In the process of the proletarian revolutionary masses becoming increasingly developed and strengthened, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations also reflected some bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies. Some people had serious arrogance and gradually detached themselves from the masses; some people formed factions and cliques, always emphasizing "me" as the core; some people had rising thoughts of fame and wealth, eager to fight for power for themselves and small groups. Various problems arose from this.

We, together with the brother units supporting the left, timely studied Chairman Mao's works with the proletarian revolutionary masses, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and trained the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations, guiding them to use "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" and "Against Liberalism" as weapons, using the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," and comparing with Chairman Mao's five conditions for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, to continuously carry out open rectification and heart-to-heart talks and reporting meetings, helping them to revolutionize consciously. At the same time, we used the methods of "inviting in" and "going out" to do in-depth and detailed political and ideological work, widely conducting heart-to-heart talks with the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, one by one to understand their ideological situation, time and time again to have heart-to-heart talks, and timely help them solve practical ideological problems, encouraging them to advance in the struggle against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and to be good leaders.

Through study, in the leading cadres of revolutionary mass organizations, the consciousness of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism was further enhanced. They resolutely responded to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao, practiced what they preached, strictly demanded of themselves, and were determined to be thorough and complete proletarian revolutionaries, not to be ephemeral figures on the historical stage. They all went down to the grassroots level, joining the broad revolutionary masses to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City present a vibrant and flourishing situation.

To strengthen the ideological construction of the revolutionary ranks, we must, in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously promote the transformation of the worldview of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are carrying out, which touches people's souls, is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's worldviews and use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate a new generation of communists. Supporting the left is to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and to firmly grasp the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, we insisted on putting the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, and in the struggle against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, repeatedly carried out extensive propaganda and mobilization, making the study and application of Chairman Mao's works a conscious action of the broad masses, and working hard to transform their worldviews.

Since August this year, we, together with the brother units supporting the left, have helped revolutionary mass organizations and some factories and schools to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study, we mobilized the masses to raise their own questions and find answers in Chairman Mao's works, with the masses teaching and the masses learning, widely carrying out mutual assistance in ideological activities, further enhancing revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, making the proletarian revolutionary masses grow faster in the great storms of class struggle.

On this year's National Day, Vice Commander Lin Biao, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao, issued the latest battle order to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism and to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We, together with the brother units supporting the left and the proletarian revolutionary masses of the province and city, quickly summarized and promoted the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the previous stage. Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various revolutionary mass organizations, factories, schools, and offices sprang up like bamboo shoots after a rain. The unprecedented mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, surged higher and higher. The broad proletarian revolutionary masses are determined to turn Zhejiang into a red Mao Zedong Thought university and to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

While transforming the objective world, we must highly value the transformation of our subjective world.

The surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolutionary furnace for educating our troops. In the practical struggle of supporting the left, the broad cadres and soldiers have undergone severe tests and received the best and greatest tempering, further promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops. At the same time, it made us deeply realize that to undertake the great historical mission entrusted to us by the great commander Chairman Mao, the most important and fundamental thing is to be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, truly believe in the masses, and correctly treat ourselves. It is to, in this sharp and intense class struggle, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, take struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism as the guideline, diligently transform our worldviews, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, consciously do as Chairman Mao teaches: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution and at the same time regard ourselves as an object of the revolution," constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to examine our thoughts and actions in the struggle of supporting the left, sweep away selfish and impure thoughts, keep a clear mind, follow our great leader Chairman Mao, and revolutionize continuously and forever advance.

In the great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards' outstanding qualities of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply educated us, making us further realize that "the masses are the real heroes." This inspired and urged us to more humbly learn from the masses, respectfully be the students of the masses, and more resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," and in the troops, carry out the love-the-people movement more enthusiastically, deeply, and persistently.

Due to lack of experience and insufficient ideological preparation, we made many mistakes and shortcomings in the work of supporting the left. Whenever problems arose, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "correcting errors resolutely when they are made," honestly accepted the criticism of the masses, publicly checked and corrected our errors. To make fewer or no mistakes in our work of supporting the left, we often went to various revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary masses to solicit opinions, listen to criticism, and turn the criticism of the masses into a force to promote our progress.

At present, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City, with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest pace, are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, resolutely implementing the policy of achieving great unity in revolution according to systems, according to industries, and according to classes, and have launched a magnificent high tide of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, greatly consolidating and developing the great unity in revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

In the unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must resolutely respond to the great call of Vice Chairman Lin to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," resolutely implement the important notice issued by the Central Military Commission. Immediately, we will launch a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the troops, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the guidance of the fundamental policy of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, be "modest, prudent, guard against arrogance, and guard against impetuosity," resolutely, together with the brother units supporting the left and the proletarian revolutionary masses, in the great struggle of thoroughly criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and uprooting the roots of revisionism, achieve new merits for the people.

    以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚决支持无产阶级革命派
    驻浙江空军部队　陈励耘　白宗善
    今年一月以来，我们驻浙江空军部队，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，以毛泽东思想为武器，同坚决支左的6409部队及其他兄弟部队一道，坚定不移地支持浙江省无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而奋勇前进。
      自觉革命，破私立公，
  坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边
    毛主席主持制定的十六条指出：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”部队介入地方无产阶级文化大革命，首先必须分清敌我，分清阶级阵线，在文化大革命中站好队。
    要在文化大革命中站好队，最根本的是要听毛主席的话，自觉革命，善于学习，思想上紧紧跟上队。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，是共产主义运动中的伟大创举。介入地方的文化大革命前，我们很多同志对这场大革命很不理解，怕乱，怕出问题，对无产阶级专政下的大民主不习惯，不适应。经过反复学习毛主席的伟大教导，认真领会林副主席的重要指示，联系实际，对照检查，我们认识到这些思想，是和毛主席的“敢”字当头，让群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的无产阶级革命路线不符合的；是站在“私”字的立场上看问题的结果。同时，我们明确认识到，要坚持毛主席的革命路线，就一定要自觉地破私立公，以最大的努力学习新事物、研究新问题，以最坚定的步伐紧跟伟大领袖毛主席。学得好，才能跟得紧；跟得紧，才能更自觉地学习。于是，我们奋起直追，对毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的指示，都在党委和领导干部中认真组织学习讨论，并“迅速地传达到下级机关和党员群众中去”，立即贯彻落实。这样，逐渐转变了不理解、不自觉的状况。
    要在文化大革命中站好队，还必须在部队中大力开展两条路线斗争的教育，深入斗争实际，分清阶级阵线，在实践中紧紧跟上队。
    我们在部队中大搞特搞两条路线斗争的教育，大讲无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，大讲无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将的伟大功勋，使干部战士懂得了文化大革命的必要性和重要性，明确了必须相信和依靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众才能搞好这场大革命。我们还把无产阶级革命派的大字报选编给连队阅读，请红卫兵小将作报告，采取摆事实、列罪状、剥画皮、揭危害等方法，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大揭发、大批判。通过教育，极大地激发了广大指战员对中国赫鲁晓夫和他推行的资产阶级反动路线的刻骨仇恨；极大地加深了他们对伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱，大大增强了他们对无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将的阶级感情。这就使部队从政治上、思想上为搞好支左工作打下了基础。
    我们遵照毛主席的教导，在支左工作中大立强烈的群众观念，大树深入实际、深入群众的作风，以满腔革命热忱和“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”的态度，到斗争第一线，到广大群众中去看、听、问、想，反复进行调查研究。通过调查研究，依靠革命小将的热情帮助，逐步弄清了各群众组织的斗争大方向，了解到以“浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部”为代表的各革命群众组织，始终把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，他们是真正的无产阶级革命派。我们和兄弟支左部队决心同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    要在文化大革命中站好队，就一定要“公”字挂帅，“敢”字当头，紧紧和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗。
    毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”这也是我们支左工作唯一的宗旨。
    支持无产阶级革命派容不得半点私心，无私才能无畏。只有“公”字挂帅，才能“敢”字当头，才能脚踏一只船，坚定不移地和无产阶级革命派风雨同舟，团结战斗。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对无产阶级革命派怕得要死，对我们坚决支左恨得要命。他们到处散布流言蜚语，造谣中伤，甚至挑动受蒙蔽的群众围攻我们的干部、战士，妄图使我们改变支左的立场。我们清醒地认识到，在这场激烈的阶级斗争中，“在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”我们教育部队，带着支左工作中的实际问题，活学活用毛主席著作，活学活用“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，同自己头脑里的私心杂念及时地、反复地进行斗争。
    当党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派使出种种恶毒手段，一次又一次地妄图把无产阶级革命派打下去的时候，我们誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无所畏惧，甘冒风险，同兄弟支左部队和无产阶级革命派一道，顶逆风，战恶浪。他们在哪里打击无产阶级革命派，我们就到哪里用毛泽东思想去支持无产阶级革命派。我们向工厂、学校、机关、农村派出大批毛泽东思想宣传队，用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，鼓舞群众，帮助他们牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，引导他们学习、研究党的政策。这样，就一次又一次地击败了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶阴谋。
    在支左工作的实际斗争中，我们深切地体会到：毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的伟大号召，是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针，也是做好支左工作的根本方针。只有狠斗“私”字，深挖修根，才能紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚；才能心红眼亮，阶级阵线分明，脚跟站得稳，屁股坐得正，支左旗帜更鲜明；才能“敢”字当头，以最大的勇气和毅力捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，全心全意支持无产阶级革命派。
      高举革命的批判旗帜，
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志说：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。”
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，是对待毛主席，对待以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的根本态度问题，也是支左工作的根本态度问题。
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就一定要高举革命的批判旗帜，排除来自右的和极“左”的方面的影响，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。
    文化大革命既然是革命，就不可避免地会有阻力。我们每紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署前进一步，都经过了激烈的斗争。当戚本禹同志《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一文发表后，无产阶级革命派向资产阶级司令部发起猛烈攻击，掀起革命大批判高潮的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为了挽救他们将要灭亡的命运，千方百计地搅乱我们的斗争大方向，妄图破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们不仅从右的方面拚命捣乱，而且还以极“左”的面目出现，利用革命队伍中的小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，挑拨离间，制造分裂，力图把水搅混，把运动引入歧途。
    在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们同兄弟支左部队和无产阶级革命派一道，及时学习中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》、姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》的文章和江青同志九月五日在安徽来京代表会议上的重要讲话，深入领会开展革命大批判和斗批改的伟大战略意义。我们进一步明确了从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙批倒、批臭，彻底肃清其反革命修正主义流毒，用毛泽东思想在各个领域里进行深刻的改革，这是无产阶级文化大革命的主题、正题，是我们革命斗争的大方向。
    我们与兄弟支左部队一起，和无产阶级革命派共同召开声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的批判大会，并派出大批干部战士深入基层，把车间、田头、学校、街头当战场，同工人、贫下中农、革命师生和广大革命群众并肩战斗，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，口诛笔伐，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人，进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争。一场波澜壮阔的革命大批判的“人民战争”，冲破了重重阻力，迅速开展起来，并且深入地向前发展。
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，还必须在批修中狠狠斗私，把革命的大批判和斗批改紧密结合起来。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是一种抗毒素，它不但将排除敌人的毒焰，也将清洗自己的污浊。”
    搞好革命的大批判和斗批改，就是要用毛泽东思想为武器去“斗私，批修”。通过斗私，丢掉身上利己主义的包袱，勇敢地投入革命大批判和斗批改的战斗。同时，又通过斗私，自觉革命，促进人的思想革命化，真正从思想上大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，保证我们永远紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    为了进一步推动革命大批判和斗批改，针对在革命群众组织中存在的那种不重视斗私，派性第一，山头对垒的状况，我们同兄弟支左部队和无产阶级革命派一道，大力组织活学活用毛主席著作，以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》有关社论和文章。在各革命群众组织中，遵照毛主席“实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之”的教导，通过亮思想，查危害，进一步认清了“私”字是妨碍革命队伍的团结，损伤革命组织的战斗力的祸根，进一步懂得了要将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就一定要在批修中狠狠斗私，把“私”字彻底打倒。
    我们同兄弟支左部队一道，还帮助各革命群众组织组成了大批判和斗批改的领导班子，研究了具体措施，使革命的大批判逐步和各单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。工人阶级一马当先，奋起批判中国赫鲁晓夫在工业部门推行的反革命修正主义路线，并且把大批判同所在工厂、企业单位中十八年来的斗争实际挂钩，把本单位的斗批改，提到两条路线斗争的纲上来。
    在我国建国十八周年国庆的前夕，北京传来了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”这一指示极大地鼓舞了浙江省工人阶级和无产阶级革命派，迅速形成了一个实现革命大联合的新高潮。在革命大批判的深入发展中，又进一步增强了无产阶级的党性，克服了小资产阶级的派性，教育争取了受蒙蔽的群众，解放了大批革命干部。杭州市绝大部分工厂、学校、机关、企业单位和郊区的人民公社，在大方向一致的前提下都实现了革命的大联合，进一步推动了革命的“三结合”。
      在“斗私，批修”中
    加强革命队伍的思想建设
    毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    在这场伟大的革命斗争中，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派，培养和造就大批永远忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，这是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计，是支左工作的最最根本的任务。
    加强革命队伍的思想建设，关键在于以毛泽东思想为武器，搞好革命群众组织领导骨干的思想革命化。
    在无产阶级革命派日益发展壮大过程中，在有些革命群众组织负责人的身上，也不断反映出一些资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想倾向。有的人骄傲自满情绪严重，逐渐脱离群众；有的人拉山头，搞宗派，处处强调以“我”为核心；有的人名利思想抬头，热中于为个人和小团体争权。种种问题也就由此而生。
    我们和兄弟支左部队一道，及时和无产阶级革命派共同学习毛主席著作，开办毛泽东思想学习班，集训各革命群众组织负责人，引导他们以“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》为武器，运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，对照毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，不断进行开门整风和召开交心会、讲用会，帮助他们自觉革命。同时，我们还用“请进来”、“走出去”的办法，做深入细致的政治思想工作，同革命群众组织的负责人广泛进行谈心活动，一个个地摸清思想情况，一次次地促膝谈心、交心，及时帮助他们解决现实思想问题，鼓励他们在“斗私，批修”的战斗中冲锋前进，当好带头人。
    经过学习，在革命群众组织的领导骨干中，进一步提高了“斗私，批修”的自觉性。他们坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席的伟大号召，身体力行，严格要求自己，决心做完全、彻底的无产阶级革命派，不做历史舞台上昙花一现的人物。他们纷纷下到基层，同广大革命群众一道“斗私，批修”，使得省、市无产阶级文化大革命出现了一个蓬勃发展的生动局面。
    加强革命队伍的思想建设，必须在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，不断促进无产阶级革命派的世界观的改造。
    我们正在进行的这场触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命，就是要用毛泽东思想改造人的世界观，用毛泽东思想培育一代共产主义新人。支左就是要大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大抓特抓活学活用毛主席著作。因此，我们坚持把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，在“斗私，批修”中，反复进行大宣传、大发动，使活学活用毛主席著作变成广大群众的自觉行动，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。
    今年八月份以来，我们同兄弟支左部队一道，帮助革命群众组织和一些工厂、学校开办毛泽东思想学习班。在学习中，发动群众自己提出问题，自己到毛主席著作中找答案，群众教，群众学，互教互学，广泛开展群众性的思想互助活动，进一步增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，使无产阶级革命派在阶级斗争的大风大浪中更快地成长起来。
    今年国庆节，林彪副统帅代表我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了要斗私，批修，要开办毛泽东思想学习班的最新战斗号令。我们同兄弟支左部队和省市无产阶级革命派闻风而动，迅速总结推广了前一阶段开办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，各革命群众组织、各工厂、学校、机关的学习班象雨后春笋般地办起来了。规模空前的活学活用毛主席著作、“斗私，批修”的群众运动一浪高过一浪，广大无产阶级革命派决心把浙江办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在改造客观世界的同时，一定要高度重视我们自己主观世界的改造。
    无产阶级文化大革命汹涌澎湃的群众运动，是教育我们部队的革命大熔炉。在支左工作的斗争实践中，广大指战员经受了严峻考验，得到了最大和最好的锻炼，进一步促进了部队的思想革命化。同时，使我们深深体会到，要担负起伟大统帅毛主席交给我们的伟大历史使命，最重要、最根本的就是要无限忠于毛主席，真正相信群众，正确对待自己。就是要在这场尖锐激烈的阶级斗争中，努力学习毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，刻苦改造自己的世界观，克服形形色色的非无产阶级思想，自觉地做到“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”，时刻用毛泽东思想来检验我们在支左斗争中的思想言行，扫除私心杂念，保持清醒头脑，紧跟我们伟大领袖毛主席，不断革命，永远前进。
    在文化大革命的伟大斗争中，广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的优秀品质深深地教育着我们，使我们进一步认识到，“群众是真正的英雄”。从而，激励和鞭策着我们，要更加虚心地向群众学习，恭恭敬敬地做群众的小学生，要更加坚决地响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，在部队中把爱民运动更加热烈、深入、持久地开展下去。
    由于缺乏经验，思想准备不足，我们在支左工作中出现过不少的缺点和错误。每当问题出现时，我们遵照毛主席“凡是犯了错误的必须坚决改正”的教导，老老实实地接受群众的批评，公开检查错误，坚决改正错误。为了使我们在支左工作中少犯错误或不犯错误，我们还经常到各革命群众组织和革命群众中去征求意见，听取批评，把群众的批评变成推动我们前进的力量。
    目前，浙江省和杭州市的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，正以最高的热情，最大的决心，最快的步伐，坚决贯彻执行毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的一系列极其重要的最新指示，坚决实行按照系统，按照行业，按照班级实现革命大联合的方针，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的“斗私，批修”高潮，大大地巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，我们一定要坚决响应林副主席发出的“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大号召，坚决贯彻执行中央军委发出的重要通知。立即在部队掀起一个学习毛主席最新指示的新高潮，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，在“斗私，批修”的根本方针指引下，“谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁”，坚决同兄弟支左部队和无产阶级革命派一道，在彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，挖掉修正主义根子的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功。
