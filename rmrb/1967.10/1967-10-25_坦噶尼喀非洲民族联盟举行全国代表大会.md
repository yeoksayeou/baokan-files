The Tanganyika African National Union held its national congress from October 16 to 21 in Mwanza, a famous lakeside city in northwestern Tanzania. The congress was attended by 560 representatives from 17 regions across the country. This congress is held twice a year. This session was the first to be held after Tanzania issued the "Arusha Declaration."

In attendance were Ugandan President Obote, Zambian President Kaunda, and delegations from other African countries.

The congress received many telegrams of congratulations from Asian and African countries. When the telegram from Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, was read, the hall erupted in prolonged cheers and applause.

President Nyerere presided over the congress as the chairman of the Tanganyika African National Union and delivered a speech. The first vice president, Karume, and the second vice president, Kawawa, also attended the congress.

In discussing foreign policy, Nyerere reiterated that Tanzania adheres to a policy of non-alignment. President Nyerere announced that Tanzania will continue to support the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations.

He told the representatives, "Now there is a real prospect: the railway link between Tanzania and Zambia will be built. He said: 'The engineering and technical surveys will soon begin; with the assurance of further practical and financial aid from the People's Republic of China, the completion of the project is beyond doubt.'"

In his speech, Nyerere expressed continued support for the struggle to liberate Africa and rid it of racial oppression. He reiterated: "The complete liberation and unity of Africa are the fundamental goals of our party and our government." He said: "If there is any place in Africa that still accepts the principle of white supremacy, then the regions that implement this principle will expand, and none of us will have peace."

In discussing the armed struggle of the people in the Portuguese colonies in Africa and Zimbabwe, he said: "The only choice is either to fight for freedom with violence or to continue to endure slavery." He said: "The people are waging their own struggle," and "nothing can stop them."

In discussing domestic affairs, he called on the nation to implement the "Arusha Declaration" and emphasized the policy of self-reliance. He explained that in Tanzania, self-reliance "means that the focus of our development will be on rural areas, especially on agriculture."

The congress passed several amendments to the constitution of the Tanganyika African National Union and elected members of the national executive committee. Tanzania's second vice president, Kawawa, was unanimously re-elected as the vice chairman of the Tanganyika African National Union.
