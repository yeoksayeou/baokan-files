The Nobel Prize Committee is "considering" nominating the leader of the Soviet revisionist traitor group, Kosygin, as a candidate for the 1967 "Peace Prize."

According to Western news agencies, in addition to this traitor, those being considered for nomination include: the U.S. imperialist's tool for promoting power politics and aggression worldwide, UN Secretary-General U Thant, the U.S. imperialist's faithful henchman and staunch defender of the capitalist system, Pope Paul VI, the International Olympic Committee, which is manipulated by U.S. imperialists and has consistently opposed the sports cause of the Chinese people and the people of various countries, as well as the reactionary organizations "Salvation Army" and "Amnesty International," among others.

Since the Nobel Prize, named after the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel, began to be awarded in 1901, imperialists and reactionaries from various countries have used the "Nobel Peace Prize" to engage in anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-peace activities. Before 1967, the Nobel Prize Committee had already awarded the "Peace Prize" to a group of imperialist lackeys, people's traitors, and various social dregs. For example, the recipient of the 1964 "Peace Prize" was the American black aristocrat and accomplice of the U.S. ruling class in suppressing the black movement, Martin Luther King. The recipient of the 1957 "Peace Prize" was the former Czech capitalist, national traitor, and Hitler's fascist collaborator, Jan Masaryk. It is particularly ridiculous that the former U.S. President and war-monger Kennedy, the former U.S. Secretary of State and architect of the "brinkmanship" policy Dulles, the great traitor of the international communist movement and the patriarch of modern revisionism, Khrushchev, the former Indian Prime Minister and reactionary leader Nehru, and others have also been "considered" for nomination as recipients of the "Peace Prize." This is a complete mockery of peace and a desecration of the peace cause.

At the same time, the Nobel Prize Committee, in line with the imperialist and reactionary political purposes of various countries, has awarded the "Literature Prize" to the extreme anti-Bolshevik, White Russian writer Bunin, who fled to Paris, the traitor of the Soviet people and the author of the anti-communist novel "Doctor Zhivago," Pasternak, and the patriarch of Soviet modern revisionist literature, Sholokhov.

This time, the Nobel Prize Committee linking the leader of the Soviet revisionist traitor group, Kosygin, with the "Nobel Peace Prize" is not surprising at all.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the Soviet people and the people of the world. They have fully and thoroughly restored capitalism at home and actively served as the U.S. imperialists' number one henchman abroad, striving to maintain the reactionary rule of imperialism and colonialism, thereby earning "meritorious service" for international reactionary forces. Not long ago, Kosygin went to the United States, where he warmly embraced Johnson in Glassboro, held secret talks, and engaged in an unprecedented global counter-revolutionary collusion, pushing Soviet-U.S. cooperation to a new stage. Under these circumstances, it is only natural that the guardians of the old world would consider awarding Kosygin a "Peace Prize."

### 苏修头目为反动势力立下“汗马功劳”大受美帝赏识  诺贝尔奖金委员会“考虑”把大叛徒柯西金列为奖金候选人

    苏修头目为反动势力立下“汗马功劳”大受美帝赏识
    诺贝尔奖金委员会“考虑”把大叛徒柯西金列为奖金候选人
    新华社二十七日讯　奥斯陆消息：诺贝尔奖金委员会正在“考虑”把苏修叛徒集团头目柯西金，列为一九六七年“和平奖金”得奖候选人。
    据西方通讯社透露，除这个大叛徒之外，被考虑列为候选者的，还包括：美帝在世界上推行强权政治和进行侵略的御用工具联合国秘书长吴丹，美帝的得力帮凶、资本主义制度的忠实卫道士梵蒂冈教皇保罗六世，受美帝国主义分子操纵、一贯敌视社会主义中国和各国人民体育事业的国际奥林匹克委员会，反动的组织“救世军”和“大赦国际”等。
    自一九○一年开始颁发以瑞典科学家诺贝尔命名的奖金以来，帝国主义者和各国反动派就利用“诺贝尔和平奖金”，来反共、反人民、反对世界和平事业。在一九六七年以前，诺贝尔奖金委员会就曾把“和平奖金”赏给了一批帝国主义走卒、人民叛徒和形形色色的社会渣滓。例如，一九六四年“和平奖金”得奖人是美国黑人贵族、美国统治集团镇压黑人运动的帮凶马丁·路德·金。一九五七年“和平奖金”得奖人是从前的捷克斯洛伐克大资本家、民族败类、希特勒法西斯占领者的走狗扬·拔佳。尤其可笑的是，美国前任总统、大战争贩子肯尼迪，美国前国务卿、“战争边缘”政策的制订者杜勒斯，国际共产主义运动的大叛徒、现代修正主义的祖师爷赫鲁晓夫，印度前总理、反动派头目尼赫鲁等人，也曾先后被“考虑”提名为“和平奖金”得奖候选人。这完全是对和平的讽刺，是对和平事业的亵渎行为。
    和这同时，诺贝尔奖金委员会本着帝国主义和各国反动派的反共、反革命的政治目的，曾先后把“文学奖金”赏给了极端仇恨十月革命、逃亡巴黎的“白俄作家”蒲宁，苏联人民的叛徒、反共小说《日瓦戈医生》的作者帕斯捷尔纳克和苏联现代修正主义文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫。
    这次，诺贝尔奖金委员会把苏修叛徒集团头目柯西金同“诺贝尔和平奖金”联在一起，是毫不奇怪的。
    苏修领导集团已经彻底背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了苏联人民和世界人民，他们在国内全面彻底复辟资本主义，在国际上积极充当美帝的头号帮凶，极力维护帝国主义、殖民主义的反动统治，从而为国际反动势力立下了“汗马功劳”。不久前柯西金前往美国，在葛拉斯堡罗同约翰逊热烈拥抱，秘密会谈，进行空前的全球性反革命大勾结，把苏美合作推进到一个新阶段。在这种情况下，旧世界的卫道士们考虑赏给柯西金一笔“和平奖金”，岂不是十分自然的吗？
