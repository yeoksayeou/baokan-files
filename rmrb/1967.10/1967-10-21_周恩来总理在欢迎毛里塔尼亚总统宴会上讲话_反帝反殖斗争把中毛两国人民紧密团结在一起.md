Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming the President of Mauritania
The Struggle Against Imperialism and Colonialism Unites the Peoples of China and Mauritania

	New China News Agency, October 20th - Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming President Moktar Ould Daddah of Mauritania is as follows:

	Your Excellency President Moktar Ould Daddah,
	Distinguished Mauritanian Friends,
	Friends and Comrades:

	In the midst of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, Your Excellency President Daddah, accompanied by the Mauritanian delegation, has come to our country on a friendly visit, bringing the deep affection of the Mauritanian people and the African people. On behalf of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my personal capacity, I extend a warm welcome to Your Excellency the President and the Mauritanian friends.

	The Mauritanian people are a people with a glorious tradition of struggle against imperialism. After a long struggle, the Mauritanian people won independence in 1960. We are pleased to see that over the past seven years, under the leadership of Your Excellency the President, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has made active efforts to consolidate national independence and resist foreign interference, and has achieved results.

	The Mauritanian government pursues a policy of non-alignment in its foreign relations, opposes imperialism and old and new colonialism, supports the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, and supports the national liberation movements of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Guinea-Bissau, Angola, and Mozambique. Here, I would like to point out in particular that in June of this year, when Israel, at the instigation of U.S. and British imperialism, launched a savage armed invasion against the Arab countries, the Mauritanian government, fearless of aggression, stood on the side of the invaded Arab people. Following the severance of diplomatic relations with the British Empire, it also severed diplomatic relations with the U.S. empire, doing things that some big powers dare not do. Mauritania's principled and just stance in international affairs conforms to the common interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, and has continuously enhanced Mauritania's international reputation. We sincerely wish that the Mauritanian government and people will continue to advance and achieve new successes in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and in consolidating national independence and resisting foreign interference.

	Comrades and Friends,

	Due to the collusion between U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, supporting and encouraging Israel to launch a sudden large-scale armed attack on the Arab countries, the Arab countries suffered a temporary setback in the military struggle. However, war awakens the people, educates the people, and tempers the people. The peoples of the Arab countries will gain a clearer understanding from their struggle that U.S. imperialism is their most vicious enemy, that modern revisionism is a false friend who betrays their interests at critical moments, and that the United Nations is merely a black market for the strong-arm politics of some big powers. The peoples of the Arab countries, with their tradition of struggle, have not been intimidated by the enemy's ferocity, nor have they been bewitched by political magic. In the occupied areas, the Palestinian people are taking up arms again and returning to the fight. A mighty wave of people's revolution against U.S. and British imperialism and their lackeys will surely rise on the humiliated Arab land.

	Currently, U.S. imperialism is intensifying its policy of neo-colonialism in Africa. It plays a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, attempting to sabotage and extinguish the increasingly deepening national liberation movements of the African peoples, and to place the entire African continent under its rule and control. However, the disaster-stricken African peoples, who have broken free from the chains of old colonialism through their own efforts, will certainly not allow the noose of neo-colonialism to be placed around their necks again. The struggle is for independence and liberation, not to exchange one more vicious new master. We firmly believe that the arrogant plan of U.S. imperialism to enslave Africa will be shattered by the increasingly awakened African peoples. No matter how ferocious and cunning the enemy is, no matter how many difficulties and twists and turns the African peoples may encounter on their forward path, they will, through long-term struggle, ultimately drive the forces of imperialism and old and new colonialism out of Africa. This is the historical trend. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has said: "The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone."

	Friends and Comrades,

	Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already achieved decisive victories. Under the inspiration of the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revise," this great revolutionary movement has entered a new stage. The current situation is better than ever before and will continue to improve. Your Excellency the President will see that the Chinese people have never been as concerned about national and international affairs as they are today. The more thorough the Cultural Revolution is carried out in China, the faster the progress of socialist construction in our country will be, and the better our country's foreign policy will be implemented. The Chinese people will more effectively fulfill their internationalist duties and more powerfully support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles and national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The imperialists and modern revisionists maliciously curse the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China, slander our revolutionary diplomatic policy, and attempt to isolate China, disrupt, and split the international anti-U.S. united front. This is absolutely impossible. More than 90% of the people of the world are on our side, and our friends are all over the world.

	Your Excellency the President, Distinguished Mauritanian Guests,

	Although Mauritania and China are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism has closely united our two peoples. Our friendship is based on the opposition to the aggressive and war policies of imperialism, and is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are pleased to see that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mauritania in 1965, our friendly cooperative relations have developed satisfactorily. The Mauritanian government and people advocate the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the United Nations and the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China, and oppose the U.S. imperialist plot to create "two Chinas." We will not forget your friendly support. In February of this year, the Mauritanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Planning, on behalf of Your Excellency the President, came to our country on a friendly visit and signed three agreements on economic, trade, and cultural cooperation. In September, Ambassador Harchi arrived in Beijing and established the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. These have opened up broad prospects for the friendly cooperative relations between our two countries.

	Chairman Mao Zedong has said, "No matter how big or small a country is, it has its own strengths and weaknesses." The Chinese people and the Mauritanian people are friends and brothers in the Asian-African revolutionary family. We should learn from each other and help each other. We believe that Your Excellency the President and the Mauritanian friends' visit to China will greatly enhance the friendship and mutual understanding between China and Mauritania, and make new contributions to the cause of unity and struggle against imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa.

	Now, let us raise our glasses,

	To the prosperity and strength of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania,
	To the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania,
	To the unity and struggle against imperialism of the peoples of Asia and Africa,
	To the great unity of the peoples of the world,
	To the health of President Daddah,
	To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong,
	To the health of the Mauritanian guests,
	To the health of the diplomats and their spouses present,
	To the health of the friends and comrades present,

	Cheers!

    周恩来总理在欢迎毛里塔尼亚总统宴会上讲话
    反帝反殖斗争把中毛两国人民紧密团结在一起
    新华社二十日讯　周恩来总理在欢迎毛里塔尼亚总统莫·乌·达达赫宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的莫克塔·乌尔德·
  达达赫总统阁下，尊敬的毛里塔尼亚朋友
  们，朋友们，同志们：
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，尊敬的达达赫总统阁下率领毛里塔尼亚代表团，带着毛里塔尼亚人民和非洲人民的深情厚谊，前来我国进行友好访问。我代表中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向总统阁下和毛里塔尼亚朋友们表示热烈的欢迎。
    毛里塔尼亚人民是具有光荣反帝斗争传统的人民。经过长期的奋斗，毛里塔尼亚人民在一九六○年赢得了独立。我们高兴地看到，七年来，毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国在总统阁下的领导下，为巩固民族独立，抵抗外来干涉，作了积极的努力，并取得了成绩。
    毛里塔尼亚政府奉行不结盟的对外政策，反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，支持越南人民的英勇斗争，支持津巴布韦、几内亚（比绍）、安哥拉、莫三鼻给等国人民的民族独立运动。在这里，我要特别指出，今年六月，当以色列在美英帝国主义的唆使下，向阿拉伯国家发动疯狂的武装侵略的时候，毛里塔尼亚政府不畏强暴，站在被侵略的阿拉伯人民一边，并且接着同英帝断交之后，又同美帝断绝了外交关系，做出了一些大国所不敢做的事情。毛里塔尼亚在国际事务中采取这种有原则的正义立场，符合世界革命人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同利益，使得毛里塔尼亚的国际声誉不断提高。我们衷心地祝愿，毛里塔尼亚政府和人民在反帝反殖的斗争中，在巩固民族独立、抵抗外来干涉的道路上不断前进，不断取得新的成就。
    同志们，朋友们！
    由于美帝国主义和现代修正主义狼狈为奸，支持和纵容以色列向阿拉伯国家突然发动大规模武装进攻，阿拉伯国家在军事上遭受了暂时的挫折。但是，战争唤醒了人民，教育了人民，锻炼了人民。阿拉伯各国人民从斗争的实践中会更加清楚地认识到，美帝国主义是他们最凶恶的敌人，现代修正主义是在紧要关头出卖他们利益的假朋友，而联合国不过是一些大国玩弄强权政治的黑市交易所。具有战斗传统的阿拉伯各国人民，并没有被敌人的气势汹汹所吓倒，也没有被政治魔术所迷惑。在敌占区的巴勒斯坦人民，正在纷纷拿起武器，重新投入战斗。星星之火可以燎原。一个声势浩大的、反对美英帝国主义及其走狗的人民革命浪潮，必将在被凌辱的阿拉伯土地上兴起。
    目前，美帝国主义正在非洲加紧推行它的新殖民主义政策。它玩弄反革命两手策略，妄图破坏和扑灭非洲人民日益深入开展的民族解放运动，把整个非洲大陆置于它的统治和控制之下。但是，灾难深重的非洲人民，既然依靠自己的力量，挣脱了老殖民主义的锁链，也就绝不会允许新殖民主义的绞索重新套在他们的脖子上。斗争是为了独立和解放，不是为了换一个更凶恶的新主人。我们坚信，美帝国主义奴役非洲的狂妄计划，一定会被日益觉醒的非洲人民所粉碎。不管敌人如何凶残和狡猾，不管非洲人民在前进的道路上还会遇到多少困难和曲折，他们必将通过长期斗争，最后把帝国主义和新老殖民主义势力统统赶出非洲去。这是历史的主流。正象中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说的：“世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。”
    朋友们，同志们！
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。在我们伟大领袖毛主席“斗私，批修”的最新指示的鼓舞下，这个伟大革命运动又推向了一个新的阶段。目前形势比以往任何时候都好，而且必将越来越好。总统阁下将会看到，中国人民从来都没有象今天这样关心国家大事和世界大事。中国的文化大革命搞得越彻底，就越能加快我国社会主义建设的进程，保证我国对外政策总路线得到更好的贯彻执行。中国人民将更有效地担负起自己的国际主义义务，更有力地支援亚非拉人民的反帝革命斗争和民族解放运动。帝国主义和现代修正主义者恶毒咒骂中国的无产阶级文化大革命，肆意诽谤我国的革命外交政策，妄图孤立中国，破坏和分裂国际反美统一战线，这是绝对办不到的。全世界百分之九十以上的人民在我们一边，我们的朋友遍天下。
    尊敬的总统阁下，尊敬的毛里塔尼亚贵宾们！
    毛里塔尼亚和中国虽然远隔千山万水，但是，反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，把我们两国人民紧密地团结在一起。我们的友谊是建立在反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的基础上的，是建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上的。我们高兴地看到，自从一九六五年中毛两国建交以来，我们之间的友好合作关系有着令人满意的发展。毛里塔尼亚政府和人民，主张在联合国内驱逐蒋介石匪帮，恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利，反对美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋。对于你们的友好支持，我们是不会忘记的。今年二月，毛里塔尼亚外长兼计划部长奉总统阁下的委托，来到我国进行友好访问，并且签订了经济、贸易和文化三个协定。九月，哈尔希大使阁下来到北京，建立了毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国大使馆。这些都为我们两国的友好合作关系开辟了广阔的前景。
    毛泽东主席说过：“国无论大小，都各有长处和短处。”中国人民和毛里塔尼亚人民是亚非革命大家庭中的朋友和兄弟，我们应该互相学习，互相帮助。我们相信，总统阁下和毛里塔尼亚朋友们这次访华，必将大大增进中毛两国的友谊和相互了解，并为加强亚非人民的团结反帝事业作出新的贡献。
    现在，请大家举杯，
    为毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国的繁荣富强，
    为中毛两国人民的友谊，
    为亚非人民团结反帝事业，
    为世界人民的大团结，
    为达达赫总统阁下的健康，
    为毛泽东主席的健康，
    为毛里塔尼亚贵宾们的健康，
    为在座的各国使节和夫人们的健康，
    为在座的朋友们和同志们的健康，
    干杯！
