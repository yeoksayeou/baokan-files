Comrades, friends,

Today marks the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. On this glorious occasion, I, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extend our warmest greetings to the workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and people of all ethnic groups throughout the country! We also express our heartfelt welcome to comrades and friends from all over the world!

Today, we celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories and when the situation at home and abroad is excellent.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has spread throughout China. Hundreds of millions of people have been mobilized. From the capital to the border regions, from cities to rural areas, from factory workshops to workers' homes, from children of ten or so to elderly people with white hair, everyone is concerned about state affairs and about consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. Never before has a mass movement been so widely and deeply launched. The broad masses of workers and peasants, the broad masses of soldiers, the broad masses of Red Guards, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals, in the struggle over the past year, have gradually united to form a mighty revolutionary army. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, they have defeated the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and made them suffer a complete collapse.

The imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries, who were frightened by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, had hoped that this great revolution would disrupt our national economy. The facts are the opposite of what these gentlemen wished for. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further liberated the productive forces. Our industrial production is achieving continuous victories. Our agriculture has had a bumper harvest for the sixth consecutive year. Our markets are flourishing, and prices are stable. The successful explosion of our hydrogen bomb marks a new level in the development of our science and technology. More importantly, this cultural revolution has educated the masses, educated the youth, greatly promoted the thought revolution of the people of the whole country, promoted the great unity of all ethnic groups, tempered the cadres, and tempered all the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Our great motherland has never been as strong as it is today.

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already achieved decisive victories. This is the first great revolution initiated by the proletariat itself in the history of the international communist movement in a proletarian dictatorship state. This is Chairman Mao's brilliant, creative, and epoch-making development of Marxism-Leninism.

We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call. We must not only thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters organizationally, but also launch a broader and deeper revolutionary criticism to politically, ideologically, and theoretically expose and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, so that they can never rise again. This criticism must be combined with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, and the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought must be hoisted over every position.

Our most important current task is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, adhere to Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, firmly grasp the revolutionary direction of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and in the revolutionary criticism, combine it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, consolidate and develop the three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Fighting selfishness means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the "self" in one's mind. Criticizing revisionism means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. These two tasks are interrelated. Only by thoroughly eliminating the "self," can we better carry the struggle against revisionism through to the end. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, and strengthen the ideological education of military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. We must establish various study classes, centrally organized, locally organized, and also organized by revolutionary mass organizations, and turn the whole country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Through study, we will help our old cadres, new cadres, and revolutionary youngsters to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, transform various non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, raise their ideological and political level, and perform new meritorious deeds for the people.

We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and vigorously promote the development of our industrial and agricultural production and rapidly raise our scientific and technological level.

We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to launch the "support the army and love the people" movement. We must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of the class enemies at home and abroad.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a movement in which Mao Zedong Thought is combined with the broad masses of the people. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by hundreds of millions of people, it becomes an invincible material force, which can ensure that our proletarian dictatorship will never change color and can guarantee that our socialist revolution and socialist construction will advance victoriously along the path of Mao Zedong Thought!

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, unite! Hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Workers of the world, unite! Workers and oppressed peoples and nations of the world, unite!

Down with U.S. imperialism!

Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!

Firmly support the great anti-U.S. national salvation war of the Vietnamese people!

Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!

Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world!

Taiwan must be liberated!

Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live great Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上
    林彪同志的讲话
    新华社一日讯　林彪同志在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们，朋友们：
    今天是中华人民共和国成立十八周年。在这个光辉的节日，我代表我们伟大的领袖毛主席，代表党中央，代表中华人民共和国政府，代表中央军委，代表中央文革小组，向全国的工人们、农民们、人民解放军的指战员们，向全国的红卫兵们，向全国的革命干部、革命知识分子，向全国各族人民，致最热烈的敬礼！向来自世界各国的同志们、朋友们，表示衷心地欢迎！
    今天，我们是在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时刻，在国内外一派大好形势下，来庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的。
    毛主席亲自发动，亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动，普遍到全中国。几亿人民发动起来了。从首都到边疆，从城市到农村，从工厂车间到工人家庭，从十来岁的娃娃到白发苍苍的老人，大家都在关心国家大事，关心巩固和加强无产阶级专政。从来的群众运动也没有象这次发动得这样广泛和深入，广大的工农群众，广大的人民解放军指战员，广大的红卫兵，广大的革命干部和革命知识分子，在一年来的斗争中，逐步地联合起来，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军。他们在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，打得落花流水，全面崩溃。
    被中国的无产阶级文化大革命吓破了胆的美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和各国反动派，曾经把希望寄托在这场大革命会把我国的国民经济搞乱。事实同这些老爷们的愿望恰恰相反。无产阶级文化大革命进一步解放了生产力。我们的工业生产胜利的捷报，正在不断传来。我们的农业获得了连续第六年的好收成。我们的市场繁荣，物价稳定。我国氢弹爆炸的成功，标志着我国科学技术发展的新水平。更为重要的是，这场文化大革命，教育了群众，教育了青年，大大地促进了全国人民的思想革命化，促进了各族人民的大团结，锻炼了干部，锻炼了人民解放军全体指战员。我们伟大的祖国，从来没有象今天这样强大。
    我们的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。这是国际共产主义运动历史上，在无产阶级专政的国家内，由无产阶级自己发动的第一次大革命。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的天才的、创造性的划时代的新发展。
    我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，不但要从组织上彻底地摧毁资产阶级司令部，而且要开展更广泛更深刻的革命大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，使他们永世不能翻身。这种大批判，应当同本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，插遍一切阵地。
    我们当前最重要的任务，就是遵循毛主席的教导，根据毛主席关于无产阶级专政下的革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，牢牢掌握毛主席指示的革命斗争大方向，跟紧毛主席的战略部署，在革命的大批判中，结合本单位的斗、批、改，巩固和发展革命的大联合，巩固和发展革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席最近指示我们，要斗私，批修。斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了“私”字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，用“斗私，批修”这四个字为纲，加强对军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。通过学习，帮助我们的老干部，新干部和革命小将，活学活用毛泽东思想，改造自己头脑里各种非无产阶级思想，提高思想政治水平，为人民立新功。
    我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，“抓革命，促生产”，大力促进我们的工农业生产的发展，迅速提高我们的科学技术水平。
    我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，开展“拥军爱民”运动。加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压国内外阶级敌人的破坏活动。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是毛泽东思想同广大人民群众相结合的运动，毛泽东思想一旦为亿万群众所掌握，就成为不可战胜的物质力量，就可以保证我们的无产阶级专政永不变色，就可以使我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设沿着毛泽东思想的道路胜利前进！
    无产阶级革命派联合起来，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    全世界无产者联合起来，全世界无产者同被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来！
    打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！
    打倒以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义！
    坚决支持越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争！
    坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的革命斗争！
    坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争！
    一定要解放台湾！
    全国各族人民的大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的马克思列宁主义万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
