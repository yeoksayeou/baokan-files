The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jinxing Production Brigade in Xiong Yue People's Commune, Gaixian County, Liaoning Province, closely follow the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the great struggle of the revolutionary criticism, and have launched a "people's war" of oral and written denunciations against China's Khrushchev. They have concentrated their efforts on exposing his heinous crimes of advocating the development of the rich peasant economy and the restoration of capitalism in the countryside. In the course of the criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are filled with indignation, and with reason and evidence, they have struck at the very heart of China's Khrushchev.

Old poor peasant Sun Jingxiang angrily said: "China's Khrushchev stands on the reactionary position of the landlords and rich peasants, speaking for those landlords and rich peasants who eat human flesh and drink human blood, giving the green light to landlords and rich peasants to hire laborers and lend money at high interest, making us suffer twice the hardship and twice the misery. His heart is more poisonous than a scorpion! The 'freedom to hire labor' that China's Khrushchev advocates is essentially the freedom for landlords and rich peasants to exploit the poor and lower-middle peasants, but not the freedom for the poor and lower-middle peasants to oppose and eliminate exploitation; it is the freedom for landlords and rich peasants to get rich, but not the freedom for the poor and lower-middle peasants to prosper together. In a word, he wants to restore capitalism in the countryside and make the countryside a paradise for landlords and rich peasants. This fellow wants to make us go back to the old road, but we oppose it a thousand times and will not agree to it a million times!"

Old poor peasant Deng Enquan, who had experienced hardships in the old society, said: "China's Khrushchev, in order to realize his dream of restoring capitalism, also found a 'theoretical' basis for the freedom to exploit hired labor, absurdly claiming that 'exploitation saves people' and 'the poor and lower-middle peasants welcome exploitation.' This is a thoroughly reactionary fallacy and a malicious slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants! In the old society, I worked as a short-term laborer for the landlord, selling my labor, and my waist was about to break. In the end, I was exploited to the point of having nothing left, with no house and no land. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of fire, and only then did we see the end of our bitter days. Since the establishment of cooperatives, we have taken the road of collectivization. But China's Khrushchev has raised the banner of 'freedom to hire labor,' trying to drag us back to the old road of 'one family prospering while a thousand families suffer.' This fellow is too vicious. What 'exploitation saves people'? We say, exploitation harms people, it cheats people. Exploitation is a crime, and it deserves to die a thousand times!"

Core militia member He Chuanzhong said: "China's Khrushchev advocates 'freedom to hire labor,' which is to restore the system of landlord exploitation of the poor, to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. He absurdly says, 'It is not scary if some bourgeois elements appear in society, and we should not be afraid of the spread of capitalism.' Look, this big villain is openly encouraging landlords and rich peasants to revolt, isn't he? Let me tell you, China's Khrushchev, this is a pipe dream, a daydream! We will use our blood and lives to defend the iron-clad socialist mountain stronghold!"

In the course of the criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants used a large number of vivid facts to illustrate how this brigade, over a long period of time, has waged a struggle against the evil winds of developing the rich peasant economy and other evil winds that China's Khrushchev has stirred up, making the collective economy advance victoriously along the road of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

An old poor peasant said: "Indeed, where there is wind, there are waves. When China's Khrushchev stirred up the black wind of developing the rich peasant economy, our brigade also experienced a wave of capitalist operations for a time. In the spring of 1963, a few people saw that fruit tree seedlings were valuable and had a wide market, so they clamored to vigorously cultivate fruit tree seedlings for sale. They said, 'As long as we focus on fruit tree seedlings, our Jinxing Brigade will be guaranteed, why bother running around, cultivating those worthless lands?' But gold cannot buy the firm hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants who follow Chairman Mao on the socialist road. As soon as this wind appeared, it was firmly opposed by the party branch and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. We told a few 'economic brains': We are running a socialist collective economy, following the road of Chairman Mao, and we absolutely cannot do capitalist things. As a result, revolutionary spirit suppressed this evil wind. At that time, if we had done as China's Khrushchev advocated, focusing on secondary industries and neglecting agriculture, only caring about our own enrichment, our Jinxing Brigade would not have become a stronghold for the restoration of capitalism?"

A core militia member added: "It was also in the spring of 1963 when a brigade in Yangrun Commune had ten million willow tree seedlings that could not be sold, and they were willing to sell them for three fen each. This news reached our brigade, and some cadres suggested that the production team buy them and resell them for one jiao each, making seven thousand yuan without much effort. But the brigade party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants knew better and firmly opposed it. The old branch secretary told everyone: 'The seedlings that others have cultivated with hard work, we buy them without effort and make money, isn't this obviously exploitation? This kind of easy profit will lead us down the capitalist road, how dangerous!' Through this incident, everyone received a vivid lesson in socialism, making us more clear-headed and more determined in the socialist direction. Therefore, during the difficult times, our Jinxing Brigade sold all our apples and vegetables to the state and never sold them in the free market."

The revolutionary criticism made everyone realize that Jinxing Brigade could be built as prosperous as it is today, with a thousand reasons, but the most important one is to follow Chairman Mao's words, to smash the capitalist evil winds, and to firmly follow Chairman Mao on the socialist road.

　　发展富农经济就是在农村复辟资本主义
　　——金星大队贫下中农狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论
    辽宁省盖县熊岳公社金星大队的贫下中农，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，牢牢地掌握革命大批判这个斗争大方向，掀起了一场人人口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫的“人民战争”，集中地狠批了他在农村鼓吹大力发展富农经济，复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。在批判中，广大贫下中农情绪激愤，有理有据，有力地击中了中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。
    老贫农孙敬祥愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫站在地主、富农的反动立场上，替那些吃人肉、喝人血的地主、富农说话，为地主、富农雇工、放高利贷大开绿灯，叫我们吃二遍苦，遭二茬罪。他的心真比蝎子还毒！中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的‘雇工自由’，实质就是只要地主、富农剥削贫下中农的自由，不要贫下中农反对和消灭剥削的自由；只要地主、富农发家致富的自由，不要贫下中农共同富裕的自由。一句话，他就是要在农村复辟资本主义，把农村变成地主、富农的天下。这个家伙妄想叫我们走回头路，我们一千个反对，一万个不答应！”
    在旧社会闯关东，受尽地主、富农剥削的老贫农邓恩全说：“中国赫鲁晓夫为了实现他复辟资本主义的美梦，还替雇工剥削自由找了一条‘理论’根据，胡说什么‘剥削是救人’，‘贫下中农欢迎剥削’。这是反动透顶的谬论，是对我们贫下中农最恶毒的诬蔑！在旧社会，我给地主打短工、卖苦力，腰筋快要累断了，到头来被剥削得滴溜光，房无一间地无一垄。是毛主席他老人家从火海里把我们救出来，苦日子才熬出了头。合作化以来，我们走上了集体化的道路。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却打起‘雇工自由’的破旗，硬要拉我们走‘一家肥，千家苦’的老路，这个家伙太狠毒了。什么‘剥削是救人’？我们说，剥削是害人，是坑人。剥削有罪，罪该万死！”
    基干民兵贺传忠说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹‘雇工自由’，就是想恢复地主剥削穷人的剥削制度，就是要变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。他胡说什么‘社会上产生一些资产阶级分子，并不可怕，不要怕资本主义泛滥。’看，这个大坏蛋不是公开给地主、富农打气，煽动地主、富农起来变天吗？告诉你，中国赫鲁晓夫，你这是痴心妄想，白日作梦！我们要用鲜血和生命，来保卫社会主义的铁打江山！”
    广大贫下中农在批判中以大量生动事实，说明了这个大队长期以来，与中国赫鲁晓夫所刮起的发展富农经济等妖风，展开针锋相对的斗争，使集体经济沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进的斗争历程。
    有的老贫农说：“真是有风就有浪，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起发展富农经济的黑风，我们大队也一度掀起资本主义经营的恶浪。一九六三年春天，有少数人看果树苗子值钱，销路又广，就闹嚷要大力畦果树苗子卖。说什么‘只要抓住果树苗子，咱金星大队就保险没有错，何必跑这跑那，种那些破烂地。’可是，金钱买不动我们广大贫下中农坚定跟着毛主席走社会主义道路的红心。这股风刚露头，就遭到党支部和广大贫下中农的坚决反对。我们对少数‘经济脑瓜’说：咱们办的是社会主义集体经济，走的是毛主席的路，绝不能办资本主义的事情。结果，革命正气顶回了这股邪风。那时如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的那样去做，重副轻农，只顾自己发财，咱金星大队不就变成一个复辟资本主义的阵地了吗？”一个基干民兵接着说：“也是一九六三年春天，杨运公社有一个大队，手里有十万棵杨树苗子找不到销路，三分钱一棵就要卖。这事传到咱们大队，有的干部主张由生产队买下来，转手卖一角钱一棵，不费吹灰之力，一下子就可挣七千元。但大队党支部和贫下中农知道后，坚决不让。老支书对大家说：‘人家艰苦劳动畦的树苗子，咱拿来不费力就赚钱，这不明摆着是剥削吗？这种食吃惯了嘴，就要走到资本主义邪路上去，有多危险！’通过这件事，给大家上了一堂生动的社会主义教育课，使我们更加心明眼亮，更加坚定了社会主义方向。所以，在困难时期，咱金星大队的苹果、蔬菜都卖给了国家，没有到自由市场上去卖过。”
    革命大批判，使大家认识到，金星大队所以能够建设得象今天这样欣欣向荣，千条万条，听毛主席的话，大破资本主义妖风，坚定地跟毛主席走社会主义道路是头一条。
