Let Hundreds of Millions of People See Chairman Mao's Radiant Image in Time
Our Country Achieves Self-Reliance in Mass Production of Color Film

The proletarian revolutionary forces in the chemical industry, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, have smashed the sabotage of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and broken the monopoly and blockade imposed by imperialist and revisionist countries. In the shortest possible time, they have produced high-quality color film, making a great contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 16th, the proletarian revolutionary forces in our country's chemical industry, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have, in the midst of the victorious sound of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieved self-reliance in the production of color film. This allows hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country to see, on the silver screen, the radiant image of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. This is a great contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, our country can mass-produce color film and achieve basic self-sufficiency. The quality of the film is good, and the price is much lower than imported film. Color films such as "The East Is Red" and "Chairman Mao Reviews the Cultural Revolution Army," printed using domestically produced color film, have been warmly welcomed by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. The production and mass manufacture of color film have shattered the hegemony of imperialist and revisionist countries in the production of color film, completely smashing their unreasonable blockade against our country in this regard. This ironclad fact once again proves the immense power of the great truth that "we emphasize self-reliance; we can, relying on our own organized forces, defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries."

This major new achievement in our country's photosensitive materials industry is the product of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line defeating the bourgeois reactionary line. As early as 1965, the Baoding Film Factory had trial-produced color film, and all revolutionary workers enthusiastically applauded this new thing. However, the old Cultural Bureau's Xiao Wangdong and other handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party sabotaged the workers' creation in every way, deliberately denigrating the quality of domestically produced color film, and attempting to strangle this new thing in its cradle. They used the excuse that the self-produced color film was of poor quality, insisting on importing from imperialist and revisionist countries. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xiao Wangdong personally reported to the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, saying: "The domestically produced film has not yet fully passed inspection, the cost is high, and the quality is poor." In this way, they sentenced the Baoding Film Factory to "death," and the workers were forced to shut down the machines with tears in their eyes.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has reviewed the Cultural Revolution Army eight times in succession. This is the greatest concern and support for the proletarian revolutionary forces. This is a great feat in the history of world revolution. All the people of China and all revolutionary people of the world day and night yearn to see the scene where Chairman Mao and the revolutionary people are heart to heart, to see the great image of the world's revolutionary people's mentor, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. However, the imperialist and revisionist countries fear our Cultural Revolution and the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and they obstruct and hinder the export of color film to our country in every way.

Can the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, allow imperialism and revisionism to bully us like this? No, a million times no. The proletarian revolutionary forces in our country's chemical industry have made a firm decision: we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought, use our own hands to produce high-quality color film in the shortest possible time, and mass-produce the radiant image of the great helmsman Chairman Mao. They firmly said: "Producing color film, letting Chairman Mao's radiant image appear on the screen, is our most glorious battle task. No matter how great the difficulty, we must overcome it and accomplish it!" Thus, a battle against time and against imperialism and revisionism began. The proletarian revolutionary forces in the Chemical Industry Department organized factories in Qingdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, Baoding, and other places to join this great battle. The revolutionary workers in the chemical industry across the country, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," in just a few months, successfully trial-produced high-quality color film. This pace of progress is something that imperialist and revisionist countries can only look up to. This is a great review of the strength of the proletarian revolutionary forces in the chemical industry department, an important new contribution to the unprecedented Cultural Revolution. Their achievements once again prove the great truth that Chairman Mao said, "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created."

　　让亿万群众及时看到毛主席光辉形象
    我国自力更生大量生产彩色电影胶片
    化学工业部门无产阶级革命派依靠毛泽东思想，粉碎了党内最大一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的百般刁难，打破了帝修国家的垄断和封锁，在最短时间内制成高质量彩色电影胶片，为无产阶级文化大革命作出巨大贡献
    据新华社十六日讯　我国化学工业部门的无产阶级革命派，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，在文化大革命胜利声中，自力更生地制成并大量生产了彩色电影胶片，使全国亿万革命群众及时地从银幕上看到我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的光辉形象，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献。
    目前，我国已能大量生产彩色电影胶片，并做到基本自给。胶片的质量良好，价格比进口胶片低得多。用国产的彩色电影胶片印制的《东方红》和《毛主席检阅文化革命大军》等彩色影片，受到了亿万革命群众的热烈欢迎。彩色电影胶片的制成和大量生产，打破了帝国主义、修正主义国家控制彩色电影胶片生产的霸王地位，彻底粉碎了他们在这方面对我国的无理封锁。这一铁的事实，又一次证明了“我们强调自力更生，我们能够依靠自己组织的力量，打败一切中外反动派”这一伟大真理的无比巨大威力。
    我国感光材料工业的这一重大新成就，是毛主席的革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的产物。早在一九六五年，保定电影胶片厂就曾试制了彩色电影胶片，广大革命职工无不为这一新生事物欢呼叫好。但是，旧文化部肖望东等党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对于工人阶级的创造百般刁难，故意贬低国产彩色电影胶片的质量，妄图把这个新生事物扼杀在摇篮里。他们借口自制的彩色电影胶片质量不好，坚持要从帝国主义、修正主义国家进口。反革命修正主义分子肖望东亲自向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派汇报说：“国产胶片还没有全部过关，成本高，质量不好。”就这样，判处了保定电影胶片厂的“死刑”，工人被迫含着眼泪关了机器。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们伟大领袖毛主席连续八次检阅文化革命大军，这是对无产阶级革命派最大的关怀、最大的支持，这是世界革命史上的伟大创举。全中国人民、全世界革命人民日夜渴望着能看到毛主席和革命人民心连心的场面，看到全世界革命人民的导师、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的伟大形象。可是，帝国主义和修正主义国家却害怕我国文化大革命，害怕毛泽东思想的传播，他们百般为难，阻挠向我国出口彩色电影胶片。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民能够允许帝国主义、修正主义这样欺侮我们吗？不能，一万个不能。我国化学工业系统的无产阶级革命派立下了决心，一定要依靠毛泽东思想，用自己的双手在最短的时间内制成高质量的彩色电影胶片，来大量印制伟大舵手毛主席的光辉形象。他们坚定地说：“生产彩色电影胶片，让毛主席的光辉形象出现在银幕上，是我们最光荣的战斗任务，困难再大也要顶上去，干出来！”于是，一场向时间宣战、向帝国主义修正主义宣战的战斗开始了。化学工业部无产阶级革命派组织了青岛、上海、天津、保定等地的有关工厂投入了这场大会战。我国化学工业部门的广大革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，在短短几个月内，就试制成功了高质量的彩色电影胶片。这种跃进的速度是帝国主义、修正主义国家望尘莫及的。这是我国化学工业部门无产阶级革命派力量的大检阅，是他们对史无前例的文化大革命的重要新贡献。他们的成就又一次证明了毛主席说的“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”这个伟大真理。
