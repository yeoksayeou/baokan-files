In the brilliant path of Mao Zedong Thought, riding the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we triumphantly welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

On the eve of this grand festival, the joyous news of our great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of the North China, Central South, and East China regions has spread throughout the country, giving immense new encouragement to hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses.

We warmly welcome comrades and friends from all over the world. They will join us in celebrating our National Day amidst the high tide of the Cultural Revolution.

The 18 years of the People's Republic of China have been 18 years of life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, 18 years of the socialist road triumphing over the capitalist road, and 18 years of the proletarian dictatorship becoming increasingly strong and consolidated.

Following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, over the past 18 years, through the joint efforts and struggles of the broad masses of laboring people, we have achieved extremely brilliant successes on the socialist road.

The socialist system has promoted the rapid development of our productive forces. Under the guidance of the general line for socialist construction personally formulated by Chairman Mao, there has been a comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and all construction undertakings. Our motherland, which was once a poor, backward, and disaster-stricken country, has leaped to become a prosperous and flourishing socialist power.

Since liberation, we have repulsed one wave after another of the bourgeoisie's wanton attacks and achieved one great victory after another. We have won victories in the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" campaigns and the struggle against the rightists. We have won victories in the struggle against right-opportunist elements within the Party and in the socialist education movement in cities and countryside. On the ideological and cultural front, we have carried out numerous criticisms of the bourgeoisie.

Over the past 18 years, our people have waged a heroic struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we, together with the Korean people, inflicted a heavy defeat on U.S. imperialism. In supporting the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of other countries, we have made our internationalist contributions. Together with Marxist-Leninists of all countries, we have thoroughly exposed and resolutely fought against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, promoting the victorious development of the international communist movement in a new stage.

The 18-year history fully proves: Only Mao Zedong Thought can save China. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we have insisted on taking the socialist road and on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. This is the direction we have followed in our struggle.

In the brilliant history of our country since its founding, what deserves to be specially recorded is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are now carrying out, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in our country have taken to the political stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In just over a year, they have created miracles that have shaken the world.

Lenin said: "Revolution is the festival of the oppressed and exploited. At no other time can the people appear so actively as the creators of a new social order. In such a period, the people are capable of performing miracles that seem inconceivable from the narrow, philistine, gradualist point of view." The development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is precisely of this nature.

The revolutionary masses throughout the country, under Chairman Mao's great call to "bombard the headquarters," have risen up to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchov. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary mass movement, with the force of a thousand thunderbolts, has smashed this bourgeois headquarters that attempted to stage a counter-revolutionary restoration, routing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line they have pursued has been thoroughly bankrupt.

This great storm of the proletarian cultural revolution has stirred the souls of hundreds of millions of people. Great Marxism-Leninism and great Mao Zedong Thought have been widely propagated as never before. The ideological revolutionization of the people throughout the country has reached a new height. In the struggle, the broad masses have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, criticized the bourgeois world outlook, and understood the great truth of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, of whose command to revolutionize, and of how to prevent capitalist restoration.

Millions of revolutionary young people and Red Guards have charged into the battlefield in this great revolution, tempered through repeated class struggles, and made outstanding contributions. The successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are gradually growing up. A large number of new proletarian revolutionary cadres are emerging. A large number of revolutionary cadres, after undergoing the severe test of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have greatly raised their proletarian consciousness, greatly improved their relations with the masses, and are making new achievements for the socialist cause.

Our great Chinese People's Liberation Army is personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. Under the personal command of Comrade Lin Biao, it hoists high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and maintains close ties with the people. The People's Liberation Army has established new glorious historical achievements in defending the country, supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, it has undergone the best and greatest tempering. It is indeed the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and an unparalleled people's army.

The tremendous spiritual force aroused by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been transformed into a tremendous material force driving the development of socialist construction. The explosion of our country's first hydrogen bomb marks the attainment of a new level in our science and technology and national defense construction.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution "has caused the smallest, smallest, smallest losses, while achieving the greatest, greatest, greatest gains." This is a very good summary.

Our country has never been as united as it is today, the various nationalities in our country have never been as united as they are today, and our national defense has never been as consolidated as it is today.

This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's development of Marxism-Leninism.

The appearance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is not accidental. It is a necessary stage in the deepening of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat and a great achievement of Chairman Mao's long-term study and summation of the laws of class contradictions and class struggle in socialist society.

As early as 18 years ago, on the eve of our victory nationwide, Chairman Mao pointed out to the whole Party: "To win this victory will not take much time and will not require much effort; to consolidate this victory, however, will take a long time and will require great effort." "Winning nationwide victory is merely the first step in a march of ten thousand li."

Here, Chairman Mao expounded a very important Marxist-Leninist principle to us. The proletariat's seizure of power by no means signifies the end of the revolution but rather the beginning of the revolution. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a very long historical period. After the proletariat seizes power, it must continue to engage in long-term, repeated struggles and contests with the bourgeoisie and capitalist forces. It must make great efforts to push the socialist revolution forward and carry it through to the end.

The laws of class struggle in socialist society tell us: The exploiting classes have failed, but they never cease dreaming of restoring the paradise they have lost. They still occupy considerable positions in the ideological field and control many fortresses. The spontaneous forces and habits of the petty bourgeoisie in cities and countryside will not quickly disappear just because collectivization has been achieved, and they will continue to breed new bourgeois elements. At the same time, international capitalist forces, through various channels, are trying every means to effect a "peaceful evolution" of socialist countries. As Lenin said: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is the most fearless and merciless struggle of the new class against the stronger enemy—the bourgeoisie. The resistance of the bourgeoisie, because it has been overthrown (even in one country), is ten times more ferocious. Its strength lies not only in the power of international capital, not only in its various international connections being strong and solid, but also in the power of habit, the power of small production. For, unfortunately, there is still a great deal of small production in the world today, and small production is constantly, daily, spontaneously, and in large numbers, producing capitalism and the bourgeoisie. For all these reasons, the dictatorship of the proletariat is necessary, and without a protracted, stubborn, life-and-death struggle, that is, without a persistent, disciplined, tenacious, and united-willed struggle, it cannot defeat the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us that after the completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, class struggle has not ended. "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its world outlook, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its world outlook. In this respect, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly settled." If one does not have an adequate understanding of this situation or does not recognize it at all, one will commit a grave error.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchov at their head, are the most tenacious defenders and the most concentrated representatives of the bourgeois ideological system. They use the power they have usurped to vigorously advocate capitalism, attempting to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and through open or covert means, they try to carry out a capitalist restoration. To smash the ideological system of all exploiting classes, we must inevitably clash with this handful of bourgeois representatives. Thus, overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road has become the main task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our struggle with them is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over who will be victorious.

The greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, summed up the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat at home and abroad, especially the serious lessons of the comprehensive capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, and profoundly revealed the laws of class struggle in socialist society. He creatively put forward the great theory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and personally initiated and led the first great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history. Thus, he grasped and solved the most important fundamental problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, greatly creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist concept of class struggle in the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, greatly developed the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thereby brought Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

A sudden clap of thunder. Once our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is combined with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, it immediately develops into an unprecedentedly powerful proletarian revolutionary force on this vast land of China. This invincible force further crushes the counter-revolutionary capitalist forces, accelerates our historical process, and opens up a new era for the history of the international communist movement.

The victories we have already won are great. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we need to make further efforts in the future.

Our future tasks are:

To hoist higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out the great criticism more extensively and deeply, to concentrate firepower and targets, to criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchov at their head, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, so that their plots and tricks to stage a counter-revolutionary restoration will be forever foiled.

To fully mobilize the masses, to combine the great criticism with the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit, to carry out thorough reforms in various fields according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions."

In addition to giving important instructions to the working class, Chairman Mao also teaches us: "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve great unity on the basis of revolution. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve great unity on the basis of revolution."

We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, develop and consolidate the great unity and the "three-in-one combination" of revolution on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and strengthen revolutionary unity.

To consolidate and establish revolutionary committees at all levels, to correctly handle contradictions within the revolutionary ranks according to Chairman Mao's principles, to correctly treat cadres, to boldly use revolutionary cadres, and to help new cadres grow.

To launch a more extensive and sustained movement of loving the army and cherishing the people, and to carry this movement out deeply and thoroughly.

To further implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to insist on part-time revolution, on-the-spot revolution, and frugal revolution, and to vigorously promote the development of industrial and agricultural production.

While further doing a good job in the "three supports and two militaries," the entire army and all military personnel of the People's Liberation Army must maintain high alertness, strengthen preparedness, consolidate national defense, safeguard the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and be ready at any time to smash the aggression of imperialism led by the United States and to liberate Taiwan, our country's territory.

To rely on the masses, to further consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, to resolutely suppress all sabotage activities of domestic and foreign class enemies, and to resolutely suppress various espionage activities of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, and Japanese spies.

An important matter is to be good at learning. To complete this series of great tasks, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, strengthen the ideological construction of the revolutionary ranks.

Marx and Engels pointed out in the "Communist Manifesto": "The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development moves in the most radical rupture with traditional ideas."

The traditional ideas of the exploiting classes are selfishness. This selfishness has been deeply rooted for thousands of years. All revolutionary communists and broad revolutionary masses must consciously take up the weapon of self-criticism, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, and courageously break with the "self" in their minds. Only in this way can we build our ranks into a proletarian cultural revolutionary army with high revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline.

Most of our cadres are good or relatively good. For revolutionary cadres who have made mistakes, we must follow Chairman Mao's traditional policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," patiently help them, give them the opportunity and time to correct their mistakes, so that they can correct themselves and catch up with the proletarian revolutionary ranks.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of new young cadres have emerged. To educate such a new contingent, to constantly instill Mao Zedong Thought into them, to make them always maintain a firm and correct political direction, to always maintain the simple and hardworking style of the laboring people, and to always maintain close ties with the people, is a major matter concerning the future and destiny of our motherland.

The leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party, the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, is the fundamental guarantee of all our victories. We must firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely safeguard the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

It must be seen: Class struggle in the coming year will still be very fierce and very complicated, and we will still advance in the great waves of class struggle. Those who, from the right or the extreme "left," attempt to shake the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, who secretly sow discord and spread slander, and those who attempt to reverse the wheel of history, the counter-revolutionary forces, must be exposed and given a resolute rebuff.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has greatly encouraged the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world and has received the enthusiastic praise and support of the revolutionary peoples of the world. Imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, and all reactionaries at home and abroad, relying on their counter-revolutionary instincts, have from the very beginning sensed that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the greatest threat to them. In order to cover up their extreme fear, they have frantically slandered and cursed our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, all their slanders have time and again burst like soap bubbles.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing," "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, denounces us as utterly worthless, then that is even better, then that proves not only have we drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy, but also that our work has achieved great results."

Let those dying flies buzz away! We will more firmly walk our own path.

Hoist higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and with unshakable confidence, go all out to win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live our great socialist motherland!

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live great Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    无产阶级专政下的文化大革命胜利万岁
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年?　《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部
    在毛泽东思想的光辉大道上，乘着无产阶级文化大革命的浩荡东风，我们胜利地迎接了中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    在这盛大节日的前夕，我们伟大的领袖毛主席视察了华北、中南和华东地区的喜讯，传遍全国，给几亿革命群众以极大的新鼓舞。
    我们热烈欢迎来自世界各国的同志们和朋友们，他们将同我们一起，在文化大革命的高潮中欢度我们的国庆节。
    中华人民共和国的十八年，是无产阶级和资产阶级两大对抗阶级生死斗争的十八年，是社会主义道路战胜资本主义道路的十八年，是无产阶级专政日益加强和巩固的十八年。
    遵照着毛主席指出的方向，十八年来，经过广大劳动人民的共同努力，共同奋斗，我们在社会主义的道路上取得了极其辉煌的成就。
    社会主义制度促进了我国生产力的突飞猛进的发展。在毛主席亲自制定的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，出现了工农业生产和各项建设事业的全面大跃进。我们的祖国由一个贫困落后、灾难深重的国家，一跃而为繁荣昌盛、蒸蒸日上的社会主义强国。
    解放以来，我们打退了资产阶级一次又一次的猖狂进攻，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。我们取得了“三反”“五反”运动和反右派斗争的胜利，取得了反对党内右倾机会主义分子的胜利，取得了城乡社会主义教育运动的胜利。在思想文化战线上，我们对资产阶级展开了多次的批判。
    十八年来，我国人民对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行了英勇的斗争。在抗美援朝战争中，我们和朝鲜人民一道，使美帝国主义遭受到惨重的失败。我们在支援越南人民以及其他各国人民的革命斗争中，作出了自己的国际主义贡献。我们同世界各国马克思列宁主义者一道，对以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义，进行了彻底的揭露，坚决的斗争，推动了国际共产主义运动在新阶段上的胜利发展。
    十八年来的历史充分地证明：只有毛泽东思想才能救中国。在毛泽东思想的伟大革命红旗下，坚持走社会主义道路，坚持无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，这就是我们走过的战斗历程。这就是我们的方向。
    在建国以来的光辉历史中，值得我们大书特书的，就是我们正在进行的这场由毛主席亲自发动亲自领导的、史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。
    我国广大的工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，登上了无产阶级文化大革命的政治舞台，在短短一年多的时间里，创造出了震撼世界的奇迹。
    列宁说过：“革命是被压迫者和被剥削者的盛大节日。人民群众在任何时候都不能够象在革命时期这样以新社会秩序的积极创造者的身份出现。在这样的时期，人民能够作出从市侩的渐进主义的狭小眼光看来是不可思议的奇迹。”我国无产阶级文化大革命的发展，正是这样的。
    全国无产阶级革命派和广大人民，在毛主席“炮打司令部”的伟大号召下，动员起来，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，发起了猛烈的攻击。在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下，革命的群众运动以雷霆万钧之力，粉碎了这个妄图实行反革命复辟的资产阶级司令部，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打得落花流水。他们推行的那一套反革命修正主义路线，彻底地破产了。
    这场无产阶级文化革命的大风暴，激起了亿万群众灵魂深处的大震动。伟大的马克思列宁主义，伟大的毛泽东思想，得到了空前未有的大普及。全国人民的思想革命化达到了一个新的高度。广大群众在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，批判了资产阶级的世界观，懂得了在无产阶级专政条件下还要革命，革谁的命，怎样革命，怎样防止资本主义复辟的大道理。
    千百万革命的青少年，革命的红卫兵，在这场大革命中冲锋陷阵，经过一次又一次阶级斗争反复的磨炼，作出了卓越的贡献。无产阶级革命事业的接班人，正在逐步成长起来。无产阶级的新生革命骨干，正在大量地涌现。大批革命的干部，经受了无产阶级文化大革命的严峻考验，大大提高了无产阶级的觉悟，大大改善了自己同群众的关系，正在为社会主义事业作出新成绩。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的。人民解放军，在林彪同志的亲自指挥下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，密切联系人民群众。人民解放军在保卫国防、保卫和支持无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，在促进工农业生产的发展中，建立了新的光辉的历史功勋，同时得到了最大和最好的锻炼。他们无愧是无产阶级专政的坚强支柱，是举世无双的人民军队。
    无产阶级文化大革命激发起来的巨大精神力量，转化为推动社会主义建设发展的巨大物质力量。我国第一颗氢弹的爆炸，标志着我们的科学技术和国防建设达到了新的水平。
    林彪同志指出，这次无产阶级文化大革命，“损失是最小最小最小，而得到的成绩是最大最大最大。”这是一个很好的概括。
    我们的国家从来没有象今天这样统一，我国各民族从来没有象今天这样团结，我们的国防从来没有象今天这样巩固。
    这是毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席发展马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命在我国的出现，不是偶然的。这是无产阶级专政条件下阶级斗争深入发展的必然阶段，是毛主席长期以来研究和总结社会主义社会阶级矛盾和阶级斗争规律的伟大成果。
    早在十八年前，在夺取全国胜利的前夕，毛主席就向全党指出：“夺取这个胜利，已经是不要很久的时间和不要花费很大的气力了；巩固这个胜利，则是需要很久的时间和要花费很大的气力的事情。”“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”
    在这里，毛主席向我们阐明了一条极其重要的马克思列宁主义的原理。无产阶级取得政权，绝不意味着革命的结束，而是革命的开始。无产阶级专政是一个很长的历史时期。在无产阶级夺取政权之后，还要同资产阶级和资本主义势力，进行长期的、反复的斗争和较量。必须用极大的努力，把社会主义革命向前推进，并且进行到底。
    社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律告诉我们：剥削阶级失败了，但是他们无时无刻不在梦想恢复已经失去了的天堂。他们在思想领域中还占有相当大的势力，控制着许多阵地。城乡小资产阶级的自发势力和习惯势力，也不会因为实现了集体化就会很快完全消失，并且还会不断地生长出新的资产阶级分子。同时，国际资本主义势力，通过各种渠道，千方百计地企图对社会主义国家进行“和平演变”。正如列宁所说的：“无产阶级专政是新阶级对较强大的敌人——资产阶级进行的最无畏和最无情的战斗。资产阶级的反抗，因为自己被推翻（哪怕是在一个国家内）而凶猛十倍。它的强大不仅在于国际资本的力量，不仅在于它的各种国际联系牢固有力，而且还在于习惯的力量，小生产的力量。因为，可惜现在世界上还有很多很多小生产，而小生产是经常地、每日每时地、自发地和大批地产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。由于这一切原因，无产阶级专政是必要的，而且不经过持久的、顽强的、殊死的战斗，即不经过坚持不懈、纪律严格、坚忍不拔和意志统一的战斗，便不能战胜资产阶级。”
    毛主席反复教导我们，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造完成以后，阶级斗争并没有结束。“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是资产阶级思想体系最顽固的维护者和最集中的代表者。他们利用所窃取的权力，拚命鼓吹资本主义，妄想变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，用公开的或隐蔽的手段，企图实行资本主义复辟。我们要摧毁一切剥削阶级的思想体系，就必然要同这一小撮资产阶级代表人物发生对抗性的冲突。这样，打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就成为无产阶级文化大革命的主要任务。我们同他们的斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级谁战胜谁的生死搏斗。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志，总结了国际和我国无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是研究了苏联出现资本主义全面复辟的严重教训，深刻地揭示了社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律，创造性地提出了关于无产阶级文化大革命的伟大理论，并且亲自发动和领导了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争。这样，就抓住和解决了在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的最重要的根本问题，极大地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政时期阶级斗争的观念，极大地发展了无产阶级专政的观念，从而把马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    平地一声惊雷。我们伟大的领袖毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的光辉理论，一旦和亿万革命群众相结合，就立即在中国这块大地上，发展成为空前强大的无产阶级革命力量。这个无敌的力量，进一步打垮了反革命的资本主义势力，加速了我们的历史进程，为国际共产主义运动的历史开辟了新纪元。
    我们已经取得的胜利是伟大的。为着把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，我们今后需要进一步努力奋斗。
    我们今后的战斗任务是：
    更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加广泛、深入地开展革命的大批判，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批臭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，使他们妄图复辟的一切阴谋诡计永远破产。
    充分发动群众，结合革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，按照毛主席的革命路线，在各个领域中进行深刻的改革，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”
    毛主席除了对工人阶级作了重要指示外，又教导我们：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合，只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”
    我们要遵照毛主席的教导，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，加强革命的团结。
    巩固和建立各级革命委员会，按照毛主席的原则正确处理革命队伍内部的矛盾，正确对待干部，大胆使用革命干部，努力帮助新干部成长。
    更大规模地展开一个热烈的拥军爱民运动，并且把这个运动持久深入地进行下去。
    进一步贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持业余闹革命，就地闹革命，节约闹革命，大力促进工农业生产的发展。
    人民解放军全体指战员，在进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作的同时，要保持高度警惕，加强战备，巩固国防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，随时准备粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略，解放我国的领土台湾。
    依靠群众，进一步巩固和加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压国内外阶级敌人的一切破坏活动，坚决镇压美蒋特务、苏修特务、日本特务的各种间谍活动。
    重要的问题在善于学习。要完成这一系列伟大任务，就必须在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，加强革命队伍的思想建设。
    马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中指出：“共产主义革命就是同传统的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；毫不奇怪，它在自己的发展进程中要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂。”
    剥削阶级的传统观念，是利己主义。这种利己主义的影响，几千年来是根深蒂固的。一切无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，都要自觉地拿起自我批评的武器，用马克思列宁主义，用毛泽东思想，去战胜资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，勇敢地和自己头脑中的“私”字决裂。这样，才能把我们的队伍建设成为一支具有高度革命性、科学性和组织纪律性的无产阶级文化革命大军。
    我们的干部大多数是好的和比较好的。对犯错误的革命干部，我们要按照毛主席“惩前毖后，治病救人”的传统政策，对他们进行耐心的帮助，给他们以改正错误的机会和时间，使他们能够改正，跟上无产阶级的革命队伍。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，涌现了一大批新的年青干部。教育好这样一支新的队伍，不断地向他们灌输毛泽东思想，使他们永远保持坚定正确的政治方向，永远保持艰苦朴素的劳动人民的本色，永远保持同人民群众紧密的联系，这是关系到我们祖国前途和命运的大事。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级司令部的领导，毛泽东思想的领导，是我们取得一切胜利最根本的保证。我们必须大树特树毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的绝对权威，坚决维护以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导。
    必须看到：今后一年阶级斗争还是很剧烈的，很复杂的，我们仍将在阶级斗争的大风浪中前进。对于那一小撮从右的方面或极“左”的方面来动摇以毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级司令部，暗中挑拨离间、造谣中伤的坏人，对于妄想倒转历史车轮的反革命势力，必须揭露出来，给予坚决的回击。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，极大地鼓舞了世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争，得到了世界革命人民热情的赞扬和支持。以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和国内外一切反动派，凭着他们的反革命嗅觉，一开始就预感到中国的无产阶级文化大革命是对他们的最大威胁。他们为了掩盖他们内心的极大恐惧，拚命地诬蔑和咒骂我们的无产阶级文化大革命。然而他们的这一切诽谤，却一次又一次地象肥皂泡一样破灭了。
    毛主席早就指出：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    让那些垂死的苍蝇去嗡嗡叫吧！我们将更加坚定地走自己的路。
    更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚定不移、信心百倍地去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底胜利！
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国万岁！
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的马克思列宁主义万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！
