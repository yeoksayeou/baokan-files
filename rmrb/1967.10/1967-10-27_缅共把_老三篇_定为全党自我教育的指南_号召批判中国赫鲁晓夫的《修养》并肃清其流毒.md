The Burmese Communist Party has designated the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao's brilliant work, the "Three Constantly Read Articles," as the ideological guide for self-education and study for all Party members, Youth League members, and revolutionary fighters. At the same time, the Burmese Communist Party calls for a campaign to criticize the black book "On Cultivation" and to eliminate its poisonous influence among all Party cadres, revolutionary armed forces, and the entire people.

The Burmese Communist Party Central Propaganda Department's preface, written in April this year for the translation and publication of the "Three Constantly Read Articles," states: "We are now translating and publishing Mao Zedong's 'Three Constantly Read Articles' for everyone to use as a guide for self-education and study. We hope that in regions and departments where material conditions permit, the entire text of this book will be reprinted and designated as a study manual for each comrade."

The preface states: "The main spirit of the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' is: (1) the spirit of selflessness and wholehearted devotion to the people by Communist Party members; (2) the spirit of internationalism; (3) the spirit of resolute determination, fearlessness of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

The preface states: "The thoughts and spirit of the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' should be closely combined with practice. We should organize study and discussion sessions throughout the Party and the army. The method of study must be combined with living practice, solve the comrades' ideological problems, and produce immediate effects in practical work."

The preface states: "While designating the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' as our guide for self-education and study, we announce the prohibition of using the black book 'On Cultivation' as our study guide. This is because that book goes against proletarian revolution, goes against the struggle to establish proletarian dictatorship, and goes against the line of cultivating revolutionary cadres for a proletarian party. It advocates bourgeois individualism and Gandhism, guiding people to cultivate themselves in a saintly manner. It detaches itself from the struggle between the two lines within the Party, advocating unprincipled compromise and idealist worldviews. The result is to disperse the fighting will and revolutionary spirit of Party members and cadres. If one studies that book behind closed doors, one will comfortably evolve into a revisionist. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are currently conducting a major criticism of that book and demanding the elimination of its poisonous influence. The preface states: "We should also criticize that book and eliminate its poisonous influence among all our Party cadres, revolutionary armed forces, and the entire people. Each Communist Party member and revolutionary fighter should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and become people who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to 'break,' and dare to make revolution."

    缅共把“老三篇”定为全党自我教育的指南
    号召批判中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》并肃清其流毒
    新华社二十六日讯　缅甸共产党把世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”规定为全体党团员和革命战士自我教育和学习的思想指南。同时，缅甸共产党还号召在全体党员干部、革命军队和全体人民中，开展对黑《修养》一书的批判，肃清它的流毒。
    缅甸共产党中央宣传部今年四月为翻译和印发“老三篇”所写的前言说：“现将毛泽东同志的‘老三篇’翻译并且印发给大家，以供每个共产党员、共青团员和革命战士作为自我教育和学习的思想指南。希望在物质条件许可的地区和部门，全文翻印这本书，并且规定作为每个同志的学习手册。”
    前言说：“‘老三篇’中的主要精神是：（1）共产党员的毫不利己，全心全意为人民服务的精神；（2）国际主义精神；（3）下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利的精神。”
    前言说：“应该把‘老三篇’的思想和精神同实际紧密地结合起来，在全党、全军进行广泛的教育。要组织学习讨论会。学习的方法必须是同活的实际相结合，解决同志们的思想问题，在实际工作中，使其产生立竿见影的效果。”
    前言说：在规定把“老三篇”作为我们自我教育和学习的思想指南的同时，我们宣布禁止再把中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》一书作为我们的学习指南。因为那本书同无产阶级革命背道而驰，同为建立无产阶级专政而进行的斗争背道而驰，同无产阶级政党培养革命干部的路线背道而驰。它鼓励资产阶级个人主义和甘地主义，指导人们进行圣人式的修身养性。它脱离党内两种思想、两条路线的斗争，主张无原则的调和和唯心主义的世界观。其结果是涣散党员、干部的战斗意志和革命精神。如果关起门来学习那本书，就会舒舒服服地演变成修正主义者。因此，目前中国共产党和中国人民正在对那本书进行大批判，并要求肃清其流毒。前言说：“在我们全体党员干部、革命军队和全体人民中，也应该批判那本书，肃清它的流毒。我们每个共产党员和每个革命战士，应该按照毛主席的指示办事，做敢想、敢说、敢干、敢‘破’、敢革命的人。”
