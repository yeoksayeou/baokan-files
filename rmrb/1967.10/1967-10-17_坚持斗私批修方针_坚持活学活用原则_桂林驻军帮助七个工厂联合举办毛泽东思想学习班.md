The People's Liberation Army stationed in Guilin helped seven factories jointly hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, vigorously struggling against selfishness and fiercely criticizing revisionism, which effectively promoted and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in these factories.

The seven factories are: Guilin Pharmaceutical Factory, Towel Factory, Chemical Factory, Beverage Factory, Light Chemical Machinery Repair Factory, Glass Factory, and the First Workshop of the Power Plant. The Mao Zedong Thought study class jointly held by the seven factories has, since its establishment, consistently adhered to the four principles of running the class: extensively studying and applying the "Three Articles," extensively breaking down selfishness, extensively criticizing the revisionist line represented by China's Khrushchev, and extensively learning from the PLA in upholding the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the Four Firsts, and carrying forward the fine tradition of the "Three-Eight Style."

In terms of study methods, the class followed the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, "Study with problems in mind, apply actively, integrate study and use, learn what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and focus on the 'use' aspect." The students brought various problems from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and invited representatives of the revolutionary masses in the city to share their experiences of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. The students acted as both teachers and students, teaching and learning from each other, and jointly improving.

So far, more than 500 workers and cadres have participated in the study class. They studied very seriously and earnestly. After returning to their factories, workshops, and teams, they took the lead in "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," becoming models of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," actively promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, and promoting the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The Pharmaceutical Factory originally had two revolutionary mass organizations with strong oppositional sentiments and a lack of unity. After participating in the study class and studying "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," they vigorously struggled against selfishness. Everyone realized that disunity and splits were mainly due to sectarianism and individualism, deviating from the direction of the struggle. After struggling against selfishness, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly leading the factories to launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism. In the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses had a common struggle target and common language, quickly stopped the internal strife, eliminated differences, and achieved revolutionary great alliance.

These seven factories, with "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, not only fully realized and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance but also had four factories that realized and consolidated the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Through study, struggling against selfishness, and criticizing revisionism, the revolutionary masses correctly treated cadres who had made mistakes; the cadres who participated in the study class also implemented political leadership, went among the masses, strictly demanded of themselves, examined their mistakes, and many cadres in various factories were liberated. The Chemical Factory alone liberated 80% of its cadres.

The comrades who participated in the study class, through struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, had unprecedented enthusiasm for production, and the production of the seven factories continued to rise. The Towel Factory was previously corrupted by China's Khrushchev's revisionist goods such as profit-seeking and material incentives, with some people chasing bonuses, picking and choosing work, lacking the revolutionary spirit of masters, and the problem of product quality was not solved for a long time. Through the great criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev, through reminiscence and comparison, the factory eliminated the poison of revisionism from their minds. Many people worked without calculating rewards, produced without calculating conditions, and actively took on heavy tasks, making the factory's production leap forward. The students of the study class broke the routine, vigorously carried out technological innovations, and continuously created the highest production records.

Recently, the Mao Zedong Thought study class, with the direct participation of the PLA, summarized the experience of the previous period of study, and decided to further take "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, to run the class better, and to turn the factories into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

### 坚持斗私批修方针  坚持活学活用原则　桂林驻军帮助七个工厂联合举办毛泽东思想学习班

　　坚持斗私批修方针  坚持活学活用原则
　　桂林驻军帮助七个工厂联合举办毛泽东思想学习班
    中国人民解放军驻桂林部队帮助七个工厂联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗私字，猛批修正主义，有力地促进和巩固了这些厂革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    这七个工厂是：桂林制药厂、毛巾厂、化工厂、饮料厂、轻化工机修厂、玻璃厂和电厂一车间。七厂联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班从成立起，一直坚持四大办学原则：大学大用“老三篇”，大破私字，大批以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大学解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的优良传统。
    在学习方法上，学习班遵照林彪同志指示，
  “带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”。学员们带着无产阶级文化大革命中的各种问题，活学活用毛主席著作，还邀请市内无产阶级革命派代表介绍在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的经验。学员之间既作学生、又作先生，通过互教互学，共同提高。
    到目前为止，参加学习班学习的工人、干部达五百多人。他们在学习时非常严肃、认真，回到工厂、车间和小组后，带头“斗私，批修”，当“抓革命，促生产”的模范，积极推动本单位的斗、批、改，促进了革命的大联合和革命的
  “三结合”。制药厂原来两个革命群众组织对立情绪大，互不团结。参加学习班的同志学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》后，狠斗了私字。大家认识到，不团结、闹分裂，主要是山头主义、风头主义作怪，背离了斗争大方向。他们狠斗私字后，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，带动各个工厂很快掀起了革命大批判的高潮。在革命大批判中，革命群众有了共同的斗争目标，共同的语言，很快停止了内战，消除了分歧，实现了革命的大联合。
    这七个工厂以“斗私，批修”为纲，不仅全部实现和巩固了革命的大联合，而且有四个厂已经实现和巩固了革命的“三结合”。通过学习，斗私、批修，革命群众正确对待犯了错误的干部；参加学习班的干部也实行政治挂帅，到群众里面去，严格要求自己，检查错误，各厂大批干部已经解放出来。仅化工厂就解放了百分之八十的干部。
    参加学习班的同志，斗私、批修，生产热情空前高涨，七个厂的生产节节上升。毛巾厂过去在中国的赫鲁晓夫推行的利润挂帅、物质刺激等修正主义货色的腐蚀下，有的人追求奖金，工作挑挑拣拣，缺乏主人翁的革命精神，生产质量问题长期未得到解决。全厂同志通过对中国的赫鲁晓夫的大批判，大斗争，通过回忆对比，从头脑里消除了修正主义的毒素，许多人工作不计报酬，生产不计条件，主动拣重担子挑，使全厂生产出现了跃进局面。参加学习班的学员打破常规，大闹技术革新，连续创造生产的最高纪录。
    最近，毛泽东思想学习班在解放军的直接参加下，总结前段学习的经验，决心进一步以“斗私，批修”为纲，把学习班办得更好，把工厂都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
