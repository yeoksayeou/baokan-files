Sato Ends His "Visit" to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Region's Second Round of Conspiracy Activities

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, the faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, after colluding with the South Vietnamese puppet regime and actively serving U.S. aggression in Vietnam, departed from Saigon in the afternoon of the 21st and returned to his country. Thus, Sato's second round of conspiracy activities in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region has come to an end.

Sato began his "visit" to Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines on October 8th and arrived in Saigon on the morning of the 21st.

Sato held talks with U.S. puppets Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky on the situation in Asia and the Vietnam War, and issued a joint statement. The statement exonerated U.S. aggression in Vietnam, turning black into white by claiming that the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is a "serious threat to peace and stability in this region of the world."

Sato, along with the likes of Nguyen Cao Ky, viciously attacked the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and cheered for the U.S. imperialist plot to permanently occupy South Vietnam. The statement said that the Japanese government "expresses sympathy and understanding" for the efforts of the South Vietnamese puppet regime and is "determined to make every effort" to achieve the U.S. imperialist goal of "forcing peace through war."

Sato also, in accordance with the instructions of his American masters, expressed in the statement his intention to further "aid" the South Vietnamese puppet government.

The expansionist ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capitalist group were most clearly exposed during Sato's visit to Indonesia. The statement issued by Sato and the Indonesian fascist leader Suharto declared: "The stability and development of Indonesia are indispensable for peace in Asia," and Japan will "continue economic cooperation with Indonesia." During the talks, Suharto demanded that Japan provide Indonesia with $100 million in "aid" by 1968 and expressed his willingness to accept Japan's demands for exploiting Indonesia's mineral resources.

After Sato's activities in Jakarta, the Japanese monopoly capitalist group will expand into Indonesia at an even faster pace.

    为美国侵越战争效劳　替垄断资本扩张奔走
    佐藤结束“访问”东南亚的阴谋活动
    据新华社二十一日讯  美帝忠实走卒日本首相佐藤荣作在同南越傀儡集团进行新的勾结，积极为美帝侵略越南效劳之后，二十一日下午离开西贡回国。至此，佐藤“访问”东南亚和太平洋地区的第二轮阴谋活动全部结束。
    佐藤是从十月八日起“访问”了印尼、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾之后于二十一日上午到达西贡的。
    佐藤同美帝在南越的走狗阮文绍、阮高其就亚洲形势和越南战局进行了会谈，并且发表了一项公报。公报为美帝侵略越南开脱罪责，颠倒黑白地把越南人民的抗美救国斗争说成是“对世界这一地区和平和稳定的严重威胁”。
    佐藤同阮高其之流一道恶毒地攻击越南民主共和国，并为美帝永久霸占南越的阴谋叫好。公报说，日本政府对南越傀儡集团“所作的努力表示同情和理解”，并“决心”为达到美帝的“以战迫和”的目的而“尽最大的努力”。
    佐藤还根据其美国主子的意旨，在公报中表示要进一步“援助”南越傀儡政权。
    日本垄断资本集团的对外扩张野心，在佐藤访问印尼的过程中暴露得最明显。佐藤和印尼法西斯头目苏哈托发表的公报叫嚷：“印尼的安定和发展，对于亚洲的和平是不可缺少的”，日本要“继续同印尼进行经济合作”。在会谈中，苏哈托要求日本在一九六八年内给印尼以一亿美元的“援助”，并表示可以接受日本对开采印尼矿藏的要求。
    佐藤这次到雅加达活动以后，日本垄断资本集团将以更快的速度向印尼扩张。
