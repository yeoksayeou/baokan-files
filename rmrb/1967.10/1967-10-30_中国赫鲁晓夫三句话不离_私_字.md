China's Khrushchev loves "private" interests; he wants "revisionism"; he hates "public" interests and fears them. "Fight selfishness, criticize revisionism" is aimed at uprooting revisionism from the root. Therefore, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists hear these four golden words and are terrified, their souls shaken. For us poor and lower-middle peasants, for us revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, these four words are extremely necessary and come at a very opportune time. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and carry out "fight selfishness, criticize revisionism" to the end.

The character "private" is the core of the bourgeois reactionary worldview. China's Khrushchev often uses some revolutionary phrases to obliquely promote bourgeois individualism, saying things like: "Personal interests must be taken care of, without personal interests there would be no collective interests... it's not about being selfless, but about balancing public and private interests, meeting both public and private needs, prioritizing public over private." He also says: "If you are truly capable, the Party will definitely promote you and will not bury talents for long." "Work diligently at this job, work at it for a long time and resolutely, and in the end, it will be your turn to shine." These are all nonsense. He starts with "personal interests" and ends with "balancing public and private interests"; he talks about "promotion" on the left and "shining" on the right. He truly can't go three sentences without mentioning his core interests, which is all about personal interests, all about "private." His ultimate goal is to restore capitalism.

Mao Zedong Thought is truly our treasure trove for revolution. This treasure trove is inexhaustible and boundless. Only with Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon can we fight against the "private" character in our minds and dare to resolutely criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, thoroughly eliminating all the poison he has spread. But the "private" character is more cunning than a fox. As soon as the "public" character in our minds weakens, it will emerge to cause trouble. Therefore, we must continuously fight and continuously uproot it. We must follow Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, "fight selfishness, criticize revisionism" for a lifetime, reform our worldview for a lifetime, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for a lifetime, resolutely carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    中国赫鲁晓夫三句话不离“私”字
    洪泾大队民兵营副营长学习毛主席著作积极分子  周根元
    毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召，象一把最锐利的精神宝刀，刺中了中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。中国赫鲁晓夫爱的是“私”，要的是“修”；恨的是“公”，怕的是“公”。“斗私，批修”就是要从根本上挖掉修正主义根子。所以，一小撮反革命修正主义分子听到这金光闪闪的四个字，心惊胆战，魂不在身。而对我们贫下中农，对我们无产阶级革命派来说，这四个字则非常需要，来得非常及时。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，把“斗私，批修”进行到底。
    “私”字是资产阶级反动世界观的核心。中国赫鲁晓夫经常玩弄一些革命的词句，转弯抹角地宣扬资产阶级个人主义，说什么：“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益就没有集体利益，……不是大公无私，而是大公有私，公私兼顾，先公后私。”又说什么：“如果你真能干，党一定会提拔你，决不会长久埋没人才的。”“安心作这工作，长期的坚决的作这工作，最后出风头的还是你们。”这完全是一派混账话。他开口“个人利益”，闭口“大公有私”；左一个“提拔”，右一个“出风头”，真是三句话不离本行，万变不离其宗，讲来讲去就是为了个人利益，就是为了“私”。他的根本目的就是为了复辟资本主义。
    毛泽东思想真是我们干革命的宝山，这座山中之宝取之不尽，用之不竭。只有用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，才能斗掉头脑里的“私”字，才敢于坚决批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫，彻底肃清他所散布的一切流毒。但是“私”字这个敌人比狐狸还狡猾。头脑里“公”字一少，它就会冒出来兴风作浪，所以要不断地斗，不断地挖。我们要一辈子听毛主席的话，一辈子学习毛主席著作，一辈子“斗私，批修”，一辈子改造世界观，一辈子跟着毛主席干革命，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
