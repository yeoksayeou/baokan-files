Under the warm care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, in February of this year, the revolutionary masses of our factory, based on Mao Zedong Thought, achieved revolutionary great unity by administrative departments and by work groups. After more than eight months of practice, we have deeply felt the benefits of this great unity by departments.

Before achieving revolutionary great unity, our factory had eleven revolutionary organizations, each with different views on cadres. After establishing a unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire factory—the "San Yi" Combat Team of Guiyang Cotton Mill—we sat together and had thorough discussions. We reached a consensus on which cadres among the leadership were part of the small handful that should be overthrown and which were part of the majority that should be united with and educated. This created the conditions for liberating cadres and achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination. On March 6, we established the Revolutionary Committee of the factory. Subsequently, all eight workshops in the factory achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We liberated 95% of the cadres and invited twenty-one revolutionary cadres to participate in the revolutionary committees at the factory and workshop levels, eleven of whom were elected as chairpersons or vice-chairpersons.

Before the revolutionary great unity, the eleven brother combat organizations in our factory, although their direction of struggle was the same, due to the small-bourgeois factionalism of some comrades, we could not unite in meetings, study, or production. Many revolutionary workers anxiously said, "If we revolutionary masses cannot form a fist, how can we have strength when we strike out?" After achieving revolutionary great unity, we focused on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, making our forces concentrated, targets clear, actions unified, and commands coordinated. Our factory's revolutionary criticism movement has surged higher and higher. Currently, we have combined our factory's struggle, criticism, and reform, gradually deepening the criticism from general aspects to specific aspects.

Before the great unity, due to the inconsistent steps of various revolutionary organizations, production was affected. After achieving revolutionary great unity, especially after our great leader Chairman Mao personally circulated our factory's experience of revolutionary great unity, the production enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers truly erupted like a volcano, with revolutionary fervor and production flourishing. After the great unity, the output of cotton yarn increased by more than 14% compared to before, the output of cotton cloth increased by 7%, and the output of colored cotton increased by more than 10%. The opening of cotton yarn and cotton machines both reached the highest level since the factory was established nine years ago. The revolutionary workers in the printing and dyeing workshop continuously experimented and created eleven innovation projects, solving the problem of weft density that had not been solved since the factory was established, greatly increasing the product qualification rate and catching up with the advanced level nationwide.

    按部门实行革命大联合就是好
    贵阳棉纺厂“三·一”战斗团
    在毛主席、党中央的亲切关怀下，今年二月我厂无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想的基础上，按行政部门、按班组实现了革命的大联合。经过八个多月的实践，我们对这种按部门大联合的好处体会很深。
    在没有实现革命大联合以前，我厂共有十一个革命组织，对干部的看法，各不相同。建立了全厂统一的革命群众组织——贵阳棉纺厂“三·一”战斗团以后，大家坐在一起进行了充分的讨论，对领导干部中那些属于该打倒的一小撮，那些属于该团结教育的大多数，有了一致的认识。这就为解放干部和实现革命的三结合创造了条件。今年三月六日，我们就成立了厂革命委员会。随后，全厂八个车间全部实现了革命的三结合。我们陆续解放了百分之九十五的干部，吸收了二十一个革命干部参加了厂级、车间级革命委员会，其中有十一个被选为正、副主任。
    在革命大联合前，我厂十一个兄弟战斗组织，虽然斗争大方向是一致的，但是由于一些同志小资产阶级派性作怪，开会、学习、生产都捏不到一起。许多革命工人着急地说：“我们革命派捏不成拳头，打出去怎么会有劲呢？”实现革命大联合后，我们狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，使大家火力集中，目标明确，行动一致，指挥统一。我厂革命大批判运动就一浪高过一浪。目前，我们已结合本厂的斗批改，从总的方面的批判，逐步深入到各个具体方面。
    在大联合前，由于各革命组织的步调不一致，生产受到了影响。实现革命大联合后，特别是伟大领袖毛主席亲自批发了我厂革命大联合的经验，广大革命职工的生产积极性真象火山爆发一样，革命热火朝天，生产蒸蒸日上。大联合后的棉纱产量，比以前提高百分之十四以上，棉布产量比以前提高百分之七，色棉产量比以前提高百分之十以上。棉纱开锭、棉机开台，都创造了建厂九年以来的最高水平。印染车间的革命工人连续试验和创造了十一项革新项目，解决了建厂以来没有解决的纬密度问题，使产品合格率大幅度上升，赶上了全国的先进水平。
