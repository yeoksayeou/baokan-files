The Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held a "Shanxi Province Learning from Dazhai On-Site Conference" in Xiyang County. This conference closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi who opposed Mao Zedong Thought and sabotaged the mass movement to learn from Dazhai. Through on-site visits, listening to reports, and exchanging experiences, the delegates further learned the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai. The delegates expressed their determination to push the mass movement to learn from Dazhai to a new high.

"Learning Agriculture from Dazhai." This is the battle cry issued by the great leader Chairman Mao to the people of the whole country. The delegates unanimously agreed that the Dazhai Production Brigade has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, and achieved great feats in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. It is indeed a bright red banner on the agricultural front. The path that Dazhai has insisted on is the path of running people's communes according to Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the socialist path that our peasants have insisted on. The Dazhai Production Brigade has set a brilliant example for building a new socialist countryside. The principles of political leadership and ideological leadership, the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and the communist style of loving the country and the collective that Dazhai has insisted on all shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Learning from Dazhai and following the Dazhai path can uphold the socialist direction, further consolidate and develop the socialist collective economy, and build a new socialist countryside.

The delegates indignantly denounced the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in the countryside who madly attempted to restore capitalism. The delegates used countless facts to illustrate that in the 17 years since the founding of New China, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines has been consistently present in rural work. The handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Shanxi, have implemented a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines on the agricultural front. They feared and hated the Dazhai Production Brigade, which insisted on the socialist direction, to death. They used every means to try to strangle the mass movement to learn from Dazhai and used every method to cut down this red flag. China's Khrushchev's agents in Shanxi maliciously distorted the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai and tried to belittle the great achievements of the Dazhai people.

The conference pointed out that in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses have exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Shanxi. The plots of the class enemies have been thoroughly foiled. A magnificent and powerful wave of learning from Dazhai has risen.

The delegates unanimously agreed that to truly learn the spirit of Dazhai, one must, like Dazhai, create a thick atmosphere of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. One must arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform everything. One must, like Dazhai, take class struggle as the key link, insist on the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in everything and everywhere, firmly implement the Party's class line in the countryside, closely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad revolutionary masses, and unyieldingly fight in the three great revolutionary movements. One must, like the people of Dazhai, carry out thorough revolutionary criticism, closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, wield the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly smash the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, and sweep away their poison. One must, like Chen Yonggui and the Dazhai cadres, always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen political and ideological work, take the lead in participating in labor, improve work style, closely connect with the masses, believe in and rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, grasp the revolution and promote production.

During the conference, Comrade Liu Geping, the leader of the core group of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke to all the delegates. Comrade Chen Yonggui made a report titled "The Red Sun Illuminates the Path Forward for Dazhai." Comrade Jia Chengran, the brigade leader of the Dazhai Production Brigade, made a report titled "Using Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Labor Management."

　　“农业学大寨”
　　山西省革命委员会在大寨开现场会决心把学大寨运动推向新高潮
    据新华社太原电　山西省革命委员会最近在昔阳县召开了“山西省学大寨现场会议”。这次会议紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举革命批判大旗，揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山西的代理人反对毛泽东思想、反对和破坏学大寨群众运动的滔天罪行。大会通过实地参观，听报告，交流经验，使到会代表进一步学到了大寨革命精神。代表们表示决心把学大寨群众运动推向一个新高潮。
      “农业学大寨”。这是伟大领袖毛主席向全国人民发出的战斗号召。到会代表一致认为：大寨大队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，创造了丰功伟绩，不愧为农业战线上的一面鲜红旗帜。大寨所坚持的道路，就是按照毛泽东思想办人民公社的道路，就是我国农民所坚持的社会主义道路。大寨大队为建设社会主义新农村树立了一个光辉的典范。大寨大队所坚持的政治挂帅、思想领先的原则，自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，爱国家、爱集体的共产主义风格，闪烁着毛泽东思想的光芒。向大寨学习，走大寨之路，就能坚持社会主义方向，进一步巩固与发展社会主义集体经济，建成社会主义新农村。
    到会代表愤怒控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫在农村疯狂进行资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。代表们用无数事实说明，新中国成立十七年来在农村工作中始终贯穿着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在山西的代理人，在农业战线上推行了一整套反革命修正主义路线。他们对坚持社会主义方向的大寨大队怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计地想扼杀学大寨的群众运动，不择手段地想砍掉这面红旗。中国赫鲁晓夫在山西的代理人，肆意歪曲大寨革命精神，极力贬低大寨人取得的巨大成绩。
    会议指出，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众揪出了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在山西的代理人，阶级敌人的阴谋彻底破产了。一个波澜壮阔、声势浩大的学习大寨的群众运动的高潮已经兴起。
    代表们一致认为，要把大寨精神真正学到手，就必须象大寨那样，把活学活用毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的，坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，用毛泽东思想改造一切；就必须象大寨那样，以阶级斗争为纲，事事、处处坚持两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，坚持执行党在农村的阶级路线，紧紧依靠贫下中农和广大革命群众，在三大革命运动中，不屈不挠地进行斗争；就必须象大寨人那样，把革命的大批判搞得深深的，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，肃清他们的流毒；就必须象陈永贵和大寨干部那样，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强政治思想工作，带头参加劳动，改进工作作风，密切联系群众，相信和依靠群众，走群众路线，和广大贫下中农一道抓好革命，促好生产。
    中共山西省核心小组组长、山西省革命委员会主任刘格平同志，在会议期间向全体代表讲了话。陈永贵同志在会上作了《红太阳照亮了大寨前进的道路》的报告，大寨大队大队长贾承让同志作了“用毛泽东思想统帅劳动管理”的报告。
