History is a mirror of life. As the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, by flipping through the pages of past events, people can better understand today's reality.

Fifty years ago, the cannon fire from the "Avrora" cruiser marked the death knell of the old capitalist world and proclaimed the birth of the new socialist world. As the oppressed peoples of the world cheered and paid tribute to the Petrograd workers, soldiers, and peasants' soviets, the bourgeoisie of London, Paris, and New York gnashed their teeth and raged, gathering under the banner of opposition to the October Revolution.

In those days, European and American bourgeois newspapers raved madly, cursing the Bolsheviks as a group of "arrogant dreamers," "cold-blooded murderers," and "enemies of civilization." They not only spread the shocking rumor that hungry Petrograd citizens were looting human flesh, but even forged a decree by the Soviet government to practice communal marriage. The frenzy of counter-revolution made the New York Times impatiently declare that the "continuation of the new government in Russia is impossible." The infamous capitalist propagandist, British economist Keynes, more nakedly shouted, "We must use force to seal Russia's breach." When the remnants of the tsar were offering a million rubles to assassinate Lenin in the dark corners of Moscow, the leaders of the imperialist powers—Britain's Lloyd George, France's Clemenceau, and the United States' Wilson—were openly conspiring to use swords and fire to strangle the newborn Soviet government in its cradle.

Since then, this great socialist revolution that opened a new era in human history, and its great leader Lenin and his successor Stalin, the glorious Bolshevik Party, and the heroic Soviet people have endured how much vicious cursing, how much despicable slander, and how much frenzied opposition from the enemy! But the enemy's lies and bayonets not only could not stop the victorious advance of the Soviet state; instead, they aroused the Soviet people's hatred of the old world and their determination to build a new world. They also demonstrated their heroic character as the gravediggers of imperialism and the shock troops of the international proletariat. It was also from the curses of imperialism and the swordplay of the anti-Soviet crusaders of that time that the oppressed peoples of the world produced love, respect, and confidence in the first socialist country.

Fifty years later, today, the cannon fire from the "Avrora" still echoes around the world. But now, what Moscow receives from Washington, London, and the entire Western bourgeoisie is no longer vicious curses and slander, but sweet hymns and enthusiastic cheers. The Soviet Union that once made Wilson and Lloyd George tremble is now seen by the likes of Johnson as a "law-abiding citizen of the world family."

Has the devil of imperialism turned into a benevolent angel? No, it is the betrayal and sellout of traitors that has brought about the devil's laughter!

Today, as the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, in the homeland of the October Revolution, which is being trampled by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, everything that makes imperialism smile with satisfaction is happening.

The red flag of October has been chopped down by the October traitors. The red star atop the Kremlin, which shone brightly for the world, has been extinguished. The red Soviet ship that sailed against the wind and waves toward communism for decades has been capsized. The brilliant socialist state has become a den of demons, a nest of filth. The old world order has been restored on the land of the new world.

It is precisely in this so-called "year of great celebration" when the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is boasting about commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution that they have committed even more acts of betrayal: Podgorny bows down at the feet of the Pope of Rome, Kosygin becomes a new "comrade" in the Buckingham Palace of Britain and a guest of the American president. The blood of the people of South Vietnam and the sovereignty of Arab countries are used by the likes of Brezhnev as capital to operate a Soviet-American counter-revolutionary joint-stock company. The Japanese imperialism, whose backbone was broken by the Soviet Red Army, today easily obtains the right to develop the resources of Siberia. The fascist executioners who massacred Indonesian revolutionaries have become fellow travelers and bosom friends of the new nobility of the Kremlin...

The Soviet revisionist clique has long opened the door to the Western way of life, and now they are rushing even more eagerly into the Western embrace. Hollywood films occupy two-thirds of the screens in Moscow. Paris and New York fashions make the new bourgeoisie go crazy. Children learning to read are fed stories from the Bible, while the sons of the privileged classes go wild with jazz music and swing dancing. The "Soviet Hotel" is busy attracting fat Western tourists, while newspapers with the "banner of Lenin" are eager to introduce "modern international hairstyles." The Soviet revisionist leaders cheer and applaud the exhibition of American lifestyle, while London newspapers contentedly write: "Russia... is beginning to taste the sweetness of Western life." The propagandists of the Kremlin chatter endlessly about the necessity of "peaceful coexistence," while Soviet and American opera singers perform "Romeo and Juliet" in harmony.

If Moscow was once called the center of the "East" by the Western bourgeoisie, today it has become a branch of the Western world. When Kosygin visited London this February, did not the British bourgeoisie spontaneously cheer for him: "Our world is your world... let's drink to your and our future"? After the Glasnost summit meeting between the Soviet and American leaders, did not Western reporters proudly say: "Johnson now understands and likes the person steering the Soviet government"? If it were not for the traitors like Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin acting as agents of the Western bourgeoisie, burying the October Revolution that imperialism has wanted to strangle for half a century, how could they have won the cheers of imperialism?

Chairman Mao said: "There is no love without reason, nor hatred without reason."

It is precisely from the love and hatred of imperialism that people see more clearly the changes in the Soviet Union from past to present, and see the ugly faces of the Soviet revisionist traitors. On this day of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution, we must hate what imperialism loves and love what imperialism hates, expose the crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in betraying the October Revolution, and subject them to a severe historical trial!

    魔鬼为什么发笑？
    万山红
    历史是一面生活的镜子。在十月革命五十周年到来的时候，翻翻往事的篇页，人们可以更清楚理解今天的现实。
    五十年前，从“阿芙乐尔”号巡洋舰上发出的十月革命的炮声，敲响了资本主义旧世界的丧钟，宣告了社会主义新世界的诞生。当全世界被压迫人民向彼得格勒工农兵苏维埃欢呼致敬的时候，伦敦、巴黎和纽约的资产阶级却咬牙切齿，暴跳如雷，在反对十月革命的黑旗下麇集起来。
    在那些日子里，欧美资产阶级报纸疯狂地咒骂布尔什维克是一群“狂妄的空想者”、“冷血的杀人犯”和“文明的敌人”。他们不但骇人听闻地捏造饥饿的彼得格勒市民抢购人肉的谣言，甚至伪造苏维埃政权实行公妻的法令。反革命的狂热，使《纽约时报》迫不及待地断言俄国“新政权的继续存在是不可能的”。而臭名昭著的资本主义吹鼓手、英国经济学家凯恩斯，则更赤裸裸地叫嚷“必须以武力来封闭俄国的决口”。当沙皇的余孽在莫斯科的阴暗角落里出价一百万卢布来暗杀列宁的时候，帝国主义列强的魁首——英国的劳合·乔治、法国的克里孟梭和美国的威尔逊，正在明目张胆地合谋用剑与火来把新生的苏维埃政权扼杀在摇篮里。
    从那时以后，这个开辟了人类历史新纪元的伟大的社会主义革命，和这个革命的伟大导师列宁及其继承人斯大林，光荣的布尔什维克党和英雄的苏联人民，经受过敌人多少恶毒的咒骂，多少卑鄙的诽谤和多少疯狂的反对啊！但是，敌人的谎言和刺刀，不但阻挡不了苏维埃国家的胜利前进，反而激发了苏联人民对于旧世界的仇恨和建设新世界的决心，反而显示了他们作为帝国主义掘墓人和国际无产阶级突击队的英雄本色。也正是从帝国主义的咒骂声中和当年反苏十字军的刀光剑影里，全世界被压迫人民产生了对于第一个社会主义国家的热爱、尊敬和信心。
    五十年后的今天，“阿芙乐尔”号的炮声还在全世界回荡震响。可是，现在莫斯科从华盛顿、伦敦和整个西方资产阶级得到的，早已不再是恶毒的咒骂和诽谤，而是动听的赞美诗和热烈的喝彩声了。当年使得威尔逊和劳合·乔治发抖的苏联，今天在约翰逊之流的眼里已经成为“世界大家庭中的守法公民”了。
    难道帝国主义的魔鬼变成善良的天使了吗？不，是叛徒的堕落出卖，招来了魔鬼的笑声！
    今天，当十月革命五十周年来临的时候，在苏修叛徒集团糟踏下的十月革命的故乡，正在发生着一切使帝国主义眉开眼笑的变化。
    十月的红旗被十月的叛徒砍倒了。光耀世界的克里姆林宫顶的红星熄灭了。几十年来乘风破浪地驶向共产主义的红色苏维埃的航船被倾覆了。光辉灿烂的社会主义国家变成了群魔乱舞、藏污纳垢的黑窝。在新世界的土地上重新恢复了旧世界的秩序。
    正是在苏修领导集团大吹大擂要纪念十月革命五十周年的这个所谓“大庆之年”中，他们干出了更多的叛卖勾当：波德戈尔内拜倒在罗马教皇的脚下，柯西金成了英国白金汉宫里的新“同志”和美国总统的座上客。南越人民的鲜血和阿拉伯国家的主权，被勃列日涅夫之流当作经营苏美反革命合股公司的资本。当年被苏联红军打断了脊椎骨的日本帝国主义，今天轻而易举地得到了西伯利亚资源的开发权。屠杀印尼革命者的法西斯刽子手，成了克里姆林宫新贵族们的同道和知己……
    苏修集团早就为西方生活方式打开了大门，如今更急剧地投入西方的怀抱。好莱坞影片占领了莫斯科三分之二的银幕。巴黎和纽约的时装使得新资产阶级分子风靡倾倒。初学的儿童被灌输着圣经的故事，而特权阶级的公子哥儿们则在爵士音乐和摇摆舞中如痴如狂。“苏维埃旅馆”忙于招徕脑满肠肥的西方游客，而挂着“列宁旗帜”招牌的报纸则热中于介绍“现代国际上的摩登发型”。苏修头目们为贩卖美国生活方式的展览会喝彩捧场，而伦敦报纸则满意地写道：“俄国……开始尝到西方生活的甜头。”克里姆林宫的宣传家们喋喋不休地忙于论证“和平共处”的必要性，苏美两国歌剧演员则情投意合地演出《罗米欧与朱丽叶》。
    如果说莫斯科过去被西方资产阶级称为“东方”的中心，那么今天它已变成西方世界的一个分号了。当柯西金今年二月访问伦敦时，英国资产阶级不是情不自禁地向他欢呼：“我们的世界就是你们的世界……为你们和我们的未来干杯”吗？在葛拉斯堡罗苏美首脑会谈后，西方记者不是也得意洋洋地说：约翰逊“现在比较了解并且喜欢这个为苏联政府掌舵的人”吗？要不是赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一小撮叛徒充当西方资产阶级的代理人，葬送了帝国主义半个世纪来一直想加以扼杀的十月革命事业，他们怎么会博得帝国主义的喝彩声呢？
    毛主席说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”
    正是从帝国主义的爱与恨中，人们更加清楚地看到了苏联今与昔的变化，看到了苏修叛徒们的丑恶面目。在纪念伟大的十月革命五十周年的今天，我们就是要恨帝国主义之所爱，爱帝国主义之所恨，把苏修集团背叛十月革命的罪行拿出来示众，对他们进行严厉的历史的审判！
