Our great leader Chairman Mao recently issued a programmatic directive to us: to criticize self and oppose revisionism. This is the fundamental policy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is also the fundamental policy for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units.

Struggle, criticism, and transformation are major tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With "criticize self, oppose revisionism" as the guiding principle, in the new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," it is very important to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry on criticism of revisionism." Opposing revisionism means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and to struggle against the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At present, it is necessary to carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units, and to seize back all the positions occupied by revisionism and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary criticism must be combined with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units. Only in this way can the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieve thorough victory.

To carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units is to thoroughly expose the crimes of revisionism, to overthrow and criticize Khrushchev and his agents, and to eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in all schools and units; it is to pool strength and carry out painstaking investigation, analysis, and research, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, to eliminate and reform all the old ideas and institutions that serve the exploiting classes.

Only by carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation can we thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road; only in this way can the broad masses better use Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish between capitalism and revisionism, to enhance their ability to resist revisionism, and to make the struggle against and prevention of revisionism have a broad mass base; only in this way can the work in all schools and units be brought onto the track of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to further establish and improve new ideas and institutions that serve proletarian politics and the socialist economic base, and to turn the whole country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Opposing revisionism and criticizing self are two interrelated tasks. To oppose revisionism, one must criticize self. To carry the struggle against revisionism through to the end and to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units, one must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to criticize out the "self" in one's own mind.

The "self" in people's minds is the soil for the breeding of revisionist germs. The handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road are precisely using the "self" in people's minds to peddle bourgeois ideas such as fame and profit, money as the commander, and material incentives, and to push the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in all fields. They use every means to give the "self" a legal cover, to vigorously advocate bourgeois individualism, to corrupt the masses, and to achieve the goal of restoring capitalism. Especially in schools, the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road collude with the bourgeois academic "authorities" to use bourgeois worldviews to educate the youth, poisoning many people.

To carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, and at the same time, it is a close combat between proletarian worldviews and bourgeois worldviews. To clean up the capitalist and revisionist garbage, it is inevitable to clash with bourgeois individualism and old habits. This struggle directly touches the soul of each person. Whether you put "public" first or "self" first will inevitably be revealed in the process of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Only by being selfless can one be fearless. Only by putting "public" first can one dare to struggle, dare to criticize, and dare to transform, can one thoroughly criticize revisionism, and completely break with old ideas and institutions, and transform the world according to Mao Zedong Thought. If one puts "self" first, one will sometimes be active and sometimes depressed, will have many considerations and hesitations in the struggle, will be timid and retreat, and will not be able to draw a clear line with revisionism in one's thoughts, and will transform the world according to bourgeois worldviews.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Revolution also means revolting against oneself. If one does not revolt against oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." Only by thoroughly criticizing the "self" and seriously transforming one's worldview can one truly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for "criticizing self and opposing revisionism." All revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary cadres, and all revolutionary masses must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto, to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform oneself, to resolutely break with the "self" in one's own mind, to establish the spirit of completely selfless and dedicated to others, to establish a proletarian worldview, and to make new contributions in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all schools and units.

To carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation is a great cause of ours to continue to destroy the old world and create a new world, and it will inevitably encounter many difficulties and obstacles. To fight such a decisive battle, one must have the revolutionary courage to break through all old traditions, and at the same time, one must have indomitable willpower and a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. Here, those who like to show off, are flashy but empty, and do not think, will not achieve anything. Only by working hard with one's feet on the ground, by working hard and thinking deeply, by repeatedly exploring and experimenting, can one create new achievements. Comrade Jiang Qing's leadership in the reform of Peking opera, creating a series of revolutionary models in drama, music, and dance, is a shining example for us to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are creating new history with great heroic spirit. Under the great policy of Chairman Mao's "criticize self and oppose revisionism," and in the practical struggle, criticism, and transformation, our socialist motherland will create a new socialist education, socialist literature and art, and so on, in the history of mankind, to establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits, and to become a beacon of wisdom that inspires mankind to move forward.

    “斗私，批修”，做好各学校各单位的斗批改
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十五期社论
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近向我们发出了纲领性的指示：要斗私，批修。这是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针，也是做好各学校各单位斗、批、改的根本方针。
    斗、批、改，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大课题。以“斗私，批修”为纲，在革命大批判、革命大联合和革命“三结合”的新高潮中，做好各学校各单位的斗、批、改，是件很重要的事。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争。当前，就是要搞好革命大批判，做好各学校各单位的斗、批、改，把修正主义占领的一切阵地统统夺回来，插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    革命的大批判，一定要同各学校各单位的斗、批、改结合起来。只有这样，无产阶级文化大革命才能取得彻底胜利。
    做好各学校各单位的斗、批、改，就是要彻底揭露修正主义的罪恶，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人斗倒批臭，肃清反革命修正主义路线在各学校各单位的流毒；就是要群策群力，做艰苦细致的调查分析和研究探索，以毛泽东思想为指针，清除和改革一切为剥削阶级服务的旧思想、旧制度。
    只有做好斗、批、改，才能彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；才能使广大群众更好地运用毛泽东思想，识别什么是资本主义、修正主义，增强对修正主义的抵制能力，使反修、防修具有广泛的群众基础；才能把各学校各单位的工作纳入毛主席无产阶级革命路线的轨道，进一步建立和健全为无产阶级政治服务、为社会主义经济基础服务的新思想、新制度，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    批修和斗私这两件事情是互相联系的。批修必须斗私。要把反修斗争进行到底，做好各学校各单位的斗、批、改，必须用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想斗掉自己头脑里的“私”字。
    人们头脑里的“私”字，是修正主义毒菌繁殖的土壤。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，正是利用人们头脑里的“私”字，贩卖名利思想、钞票挂帅、物质刺激等等资产阶级货色，在各个领域推行反革命修正主义路线的。他们千方百计地给“私”字披上合法的外衣，大肆鼓吹资产阶级利己主义，腐蚀群众，以便达到复辟资本主义的目的。特别是在学校里，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派同资产阶级反动学术“权威”勾结在一起，用资产阶级世界观教育青年，毒害了许多人。
    做好各学校各单位的斗、批、改，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，同时，也是一场无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的短兵相接的战斗。要清除资本主义、修正主义的垃圾，就必然要同资产阶级个人主义、旧的习惯势力发生冲突。这场斗争直接触及每个人的灵魂。你是无产阶级的“公”字当头，还是资产阶级个人主义的“私”字当头，必然要在斗、批、改的过程中表现出来。无私才能无畏。“公”字当头，才敢于斗，敢于批，敢于改，才能批透修正主义，同旧思想、旧制度彻底决裂，按照毛泽东思想改造世界。“私”字当头，就会时而积极，时而消沉，就会在斗争中顾虑重重，畏缩不前，就会在思想上同修正主义划不清界限，按照资产阶级世界观改造世界。
    林彪同志说：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”只有狠斗“私”字，认真改造自己的世界观，才能真正做好各学校各单位的斗、批、改。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是“斗私，批修”的最锐利的武器。广大革命师生，无产阶级革命派和一切革命群众，要更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，特别是要把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，用毛泽东思想来改造自己，坚决同自己头脑里的“私”字决裂，树立毫不利己专门利人的精神，树立无产阶级世界观，在各学校各单位的斗、批、改中作出新的贡献。
    做好斗、批、改，是我们继续破坏旧世界、创造新世界的一种伟大事业，一定会遇到许多困难和阻力。打好这样一场攻坚战，既要有披荆斩棘、冲破一切旧传统的革命勇气，又要有坚韧不拔的毅力和实事求是的科学态度。在这里，爱出风头，华而不实，不动脑筋，是不会有什么作为的。唯有脚踏实地、埋头苦干、认真思考问题，反复地进行探索和试验，才能创造出新的成果。江青同志领导京剧革命，在戏剧和音乐、舞蹈各个方面创造一系列革命样板的实践，是我们进行斗、批、改的光辉榜样。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民，正以大无畏的英雄气概，创造新的历史。我们的社会主义祖国，在毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大方针指引下，在切切实实的斗、批、改的实践中，将创造出人类历史上崭新的社会主义的教育、社会主义的文艺等等，大立新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯，成为鼓舞人类前进的智慧的灯塔。
