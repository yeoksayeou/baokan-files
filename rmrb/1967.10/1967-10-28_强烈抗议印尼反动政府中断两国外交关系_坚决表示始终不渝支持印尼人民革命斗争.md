The Government of the People's Republic of China Issues a Statement

Strongly Protesting the Indonesian Reactionary Government's Severance of Diplomatic Relations
Firmly Expressing Unwavering Support for the Indonesian People's Revolutionary Struggle

All consequences of the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries will be entirely borne by the current Indonesian government. The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, by severing diplomatic relations, seeks to curry favor with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. This will not harm the great People's Republic of China in the slightest and will not block the brilliant rays of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese government and people will forever adhere to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and will do our utmost to fulfill our internationalist duty to the Indonesian people. We will continue to take all necessary and possible measures to protect the legitimate rights of the overseas Chinese.

New China News Agency, October 27th—The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on October 27th. The full text is as follows:

Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China
October 27, 1967

(1) On October 1, 1967, the Indonesian reactionary government once again dispatched a large number of armed military and police forces, along with over a thousand thugs, to launch an armed attack on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. They shot and injured the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Huang Wensheng and all embassy personnel. This was the forty-third armed attack in two years by the Indonesian reactionary government on China's diplomatic representative institutions in Indonesia, and it is one of the rare fascist atrocities in the history of international diplomatic relations.

The Chinese government has strongly protested and made serious demands to the Indonesian government on October 1 and October 5, and decided to dispatch a special plane to bring back the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires and other seriously injured personnel. These demands were arrogantly rejected by the Indonesian reactionary government.

Subsequently, the Indonesian reactionary government, in its notes of October 9 and October 23, brazenly announced the closure of its embassy in China and the withdrawal of all personnel; at the same time, it unreasonably demanded that the Chinese government close the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, the Consulate General in Jakarta, and the consulates in Medan, Makassar, and Surabaya by October 30, and withdraw all embassy and consulate personnel.

The Chinese government and people express great indignation and strong protest against the Indonesian reactionary government's adoption of such despicable means to sever diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Due to the serious steps taken by the Indonesian reactionary government, the Chinese government has no choice but to announce the temporary closure of the Chinese Embassy and consulates in Indonesia, and the withdrawal of all embassy and consulate personnel.

The Chinese government solemnly declares: The responsibility for the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia lies entirely with the Indonesian side, and all consequences arising therefrom must be entirely borne by the current Indonesian government.

(2) To shift the blame for its sabotage of relations between the two countries, the Indonesian reactionary government, in its note, completely ignores the facts and falsely accuses the Chinese government of "violating international norms" and "deliberately worsening relations between the two countries." This is a complete reversal of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white, and a sheer fabrication.

The fact is that over the past two years, the Indonesian reactionary government has brazenly violated the diplomatic privileges of China's representative institutions and the personal safety of Chinese diplomatic personnel. To date, a total of sixty-eight Chinese diplomatic personnel have been shot or beaten by them, and thirteen of China's diplomatic representative offices and residences have been illegally seized. Even after this bloody incident on October 1, the Indonesian reactionary government openly abducted all Chinese embassy personnel from the embassy and dispatched troops to occupy the embassy for eleven hours; then, it imposed a strict armed blockade on the Chinese embassy, completely depriving embassy personnel of their personal freedom, cutting off all telegraphic communications between the embassy and the Chinese government, and stopping the supply of water, electricity, and gas. Even when embassy personnel needed to go to the hospital for treatment, they faced various unreasonable obstacles. All this fully proves that the gross violation of international norms and the willful sabotage of relations between the two countries are not done by anyone else but by the Indonesian reactionary government itself.

(3) While carrying out frenzied attacks and sabotage against China's representative institutions, the Indonesian reactionary government has also carried out inhuman racial persecution against the broad masses of overseas Chinese.

The broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and for the sake of defending the dignity of the motherland, defending their legitimate rights and interests, and defending the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, they have waged an unyielding and heroic struggle against the racial persecution of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. They have faced the guns and bayonets of the Indonesian reactionaries without fear of violence or sacrifice, displaying the great heroic spirit of the Chinese people.

Overseas Chinese have lived in Indonesia for generations, and in the long-term common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, they have shared the same fate and hardships with the Indonesian people, forging a deep bond of friendship. We are deeply convinced that no matter how difficult and complex the situation may be, the broad masses of overseas Chinese will certainly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and unite more closely with the Indonesian people to fight against the racial persecution of the Suharto-Nasution military regime.

The struggle of overseas Chinese against persecution is just and will certainly win the sympathy and support of the Indonesian people and the people of the world. The seven hundred million people of the motherland are the strong backing of the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese. Although the Indonesian reactionary government has sabotaged relations between the two countries, the Chinese government and people will continue to take all necessary and possible measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

(4) The Indonesian fascist military clique led by Suharto-Nasution is rampantly anti-China and anti-Chinese, which is the inevitable result of their implementation of a counter-revolutionary policy of selling out the country, dictatorship, anti-communism, and anti-people. Since they seized power in 1965, they have imposed a fascist dictatorship at home, carrying out mass slaughter, mass arrests, and mass plunder against the revolutionary people of Indonesia and patriotic figures, pushing the Indonesian people into a deep abyss of disaster; abroad, they have sold themselves to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, acting as their lackeys; and towards the Chinese government and people, who have consistently and resolutely supported the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism, they harbor deep hatred.

The anti-China and anti-Chinese actions of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime are but a small backlash in the current great international situation. Their anti-China stance is like an ant trying to shake a tree, which is beyond their capacity. They think that by severing diplomatic relations with China, they can curry favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, but this will not harm the great People's Republic of China in the slightest and will not block the brilliant rays of Mao Zedong Thought. On the contrary, these jumping jacks, Suharto and Nasution, have more thoroughly exposed their true selves as traitors, and they will certainly "lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet."

Although relations between China and Indonesia have been temporarily severed due to the sabotage by the Indonesian reactionaries, we are firmly convinced that the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries is unbreakable by any force. The Chinese government and people will forever adhere to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and will unwaveringly and resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, doing our utmost to fulfill our proletarian internationalist duty to the Indonesian people.

    中华人民共和国政府发表声明
    强烈抗议印尼反动政府中断两国外交关系
    坚决表示始终不渝支持印尼人民革命斗争
    两国外交关系中断的一切后果，完全由印尼现政府承担。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权想用中断两国外交关系，向美帝苏修捞取犒赏，这丝毫无损于伟大的中华人民共和国，阻挡不了伟大的毛泽东思想的万丈光芒。中国政府和人民将永远遵循伟大领袖毛主席教导，尽最大力量履行对印尼人民的国际主义义务，将继续采取一切必要和可能的措施，保护华侨正当权益。
    新华社二十七日讯　中华人民共和国政府二十七日发表声明。全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
                        一九六七年十月二十七日
      （一）一九六七年十月一日，印尼反动政府又一次出动大批武装军警和一千多名暴徒，武装袭击中国驻印尼大使馆，枪伤、打伤中国临时代办黄文胜和大使馆全部人员。这是两年以来印尼反动政府对中国在印尼的外交代表机构的第四十三次武装袭击，是国际外交关系史上少有的法西斯暴行。
    中国政府对此曾于十月一日和十月五日向印尼政府提出最强烈抗议和严正要求，并决定派专机接回中国临时代办和其他重伤人员。这些要求被印尼反动政府蛮横拒绝。
    接着，印尼反动政府在十月九日和十月二十三日来照，悍然宣布关闭其驻华大使馆，撤走全部人员；同时无理要求中国政府在十月三十日以前关闭中国驻印尼大使馆、驻雅加达总领事馆和驻棉兰、马辰、锡江等地领事馆，撤回使领馆全部人员。
    中国政府和中国人民，对于印尼反动政府以这样卑劣的手法中断两国外交关系的行为，表示极大的愤慨，提出强烈的抗议。
    由于印尼反动政府所采取的严重步骤，中国政府不得不宣布暂时关闭中国驻印尼大使馆和各领事馆，并且撤回使领馆全部人员。
    中国政府严正声明：中国和印尼两国外交关系的中断，责任完全在印尼方面，由此而产生的一切后果，必须完全由印尼现政府承担。
      （二）印尼反动政府为了推卸它破坏两国关系的罪责，竟在来照中完全不顾事实，反诬中国政府“违反国际关系准则”、“蓄意恶化两国关系”。这完全是颠倒是非，混淆黑白，是彻头彻尾的捏造。
    事实是，两年来，印尼反动政府肆无忌惮地侵犯中国代表机构的外交特权和中国外交人员的人身安全。迄今为止，被他们枪伤、打伤的中国外交人员共达六十八名，被他们非法霸占的中国外交代表机构办公处所和宿舍共达十三处。就在这次十月一日血腥事件以后，印尼反动政府竟公然将中国大使馆人员全部劫持离馆，并派军队占领大使馆达十一小时之久；接着，又对中国大使馆实行严密的武装封锁，完全剥夺了大使馆人员的人身自由，切断了大使馆同中国政府的一切电讯联系，断绝了水、电和煤气供应，甚至连使馆伤员去医院治疗，都受到各种无理刁难。这一切充分证明，粗暴践踏国际关系准则，恣意破坏两国关系的，不是别人，正是印尼反动政府自己。
      （三）印尼反动政府在对中国代表机构进行疯狂袭击破坏的同时，还对广大华侨进行了灭绝人性的种族主义迫害。
    在印尼的广大爱国华侨高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，为了维护祖国的尊严，维护自己的正当权益，维护两国人民的传统友谊，对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的种族主义迫害，进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争。他们面对印尼反动派的枪口和刺刀，不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，表现了中国人民大无畏的英雄气概。
    华侨世代居住印尼，在长期的反帝、反殖的共同斗争中，同印尼人民同命运，共患难，结下深厚的战斗友谊。我们深信，不论在任何艰险复杂的情况下，广大华侨一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更加紧密地同印尼人民团结在一起，为反对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安军人政权的种族主义迫害而斗争。
    华侨反迫害的斗争是正义的，一定会得到印尼人民和全世界人民的同情和支持。祖国七亿人民是广大爱国华侨的坚强后盾。尽管印尼反动政府破坏了两国关系，中国政府和中国人民将继续采取一切必要和可能的措施，保护华侨的正当权益。
      （四）以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼法西斯军人集团猖狂反华排华，是他们执行卖国、独裁、反共、反人民的反革命政策的必然结果。他们在一九六五年篡夺政权以来，对内实行法西斯暴政，对印尼革命人民以及爱国志士实行大屠杀、大逮捕、大掠夺，把印尼人民推进灾难重重的深渊；对外卖身投靠美帝、苏修，充当他们的走卒；对一贯坚决支持印尼人民反帝反殖斗争的中国政府和中国人民，怀着刻骨的仇恨。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权反华排华，不过是当前世界大好形势中的一股小小的逆流。他们反华，是蚍蜉撼树，不自量力。他们想用中断同中国的外交关系，来向美帝、苏修捞取犒赏，这丝毫无损于伟大的中华人民共和国，也阻挡不了伟大的毛泽东思想的万丈光芒。恰恰相反，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安这些跳梁小丑，更彻底地暴露了他们自己的卖国贼的真面目，他们必将“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    尽管中国印尼两国关系遭到印尼反动派的破坏而暂告中断，但是，我们坚信，两国人民的战斗友谊是任何力量都破坏不了的。中国政府和中国人民将永远遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，始终不渝地坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争，尽最大的力量来履行我们对印尼人民的无产阶级国际主义义务。
