“Mao Zedong is our Lenin!”

Beijing University	Hong Bin

	“Mao Zedong is our Lenin!” This is the Soviet people’s boundless affectionate remembrance of the great Lenin, and their heartfelt expression of boundless love and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao!

	“Mao Zedong is our Lenin!” This is the distant thunder rumbling in the sky, and the impending storm that will sweep away all the demons and monsters on Soviet soil!

	The sky over the Soviet Union is filled with rolling dark clouds. This small clique of traitors who have betrayed Lenin, led by the Soviet revisionists, are fiercely opposing Stalin, grossly distorting and mutilating Leninism, and are busily engaged in the evil deeds of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. A once-revolutionary Soviet Union has been ruined beyond recognition, and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union has turned into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The Soviet people, filled with rage, watch as this clique of traitors who have seized the Kremlin chop down the banner of Lenin. How they yearn to dispel the clouds and see the red sun again!

	The red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. It is Chairman Mao who, with genius and creativity, comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. In the early 20th century, Marxism developed to the stage of Leninism. In the present era, it has developed to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the stormy five continents and four seas, warming the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world! Especially the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao in China has ignited the hope of the Soviet people to liberate themselves from the reactionary rule of revisionism. How can the Soviet people not love and admire the great teacher of the world’s revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, boundlessly?

	This gang of traitors, who have gone mad in opposing Stalin and chopping down the red banner of Leninism, will naturally, from the instincts of their reactionary class, viciously attack our great leader Chairman Mao and frenziedly hate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. However, the broad masses of the Soviet people, who have been personally taught and nurtured by Lenin and Stalin, love Chairman Mao just as they love Lenin. No matter how much the Soviet revisionist leadership clique blocks and prohibits, the Soviet people are extremely eager to obtain Chairman Mao’s precious books. Listen, under the dark rule of the Soviet revisionist traitors, an ordinary Soviet laborer says to a Chinese comrade: “I want Mao Zedong’s books!” “The Soviet people need this book!” This is the Soviet people’s cry for truth, the heartfelt voice of the Soviet working people! This gang of shameless traitors will never be able to remove the great image of Chairman Mao from the hearts of the Soviet people, just as they will never be able to remove the great image of Lenin from the hearts of the Soviet people!

	The October Revolution’s cannon shot brought Marxism-Leninism to China; the cannon shot of China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has spread Mao Zedong Thought more widely throughout the world. Half a century apart, two earth-shaking cannon shots, two giants—great Lenin and Chairman Mao—have tightly linked the destinies of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

	The revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable. Because this revolutionary friendship was nurtured by Lenin and his close comrade-in-arms Stalin, and by the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	Today, the peoples of China and the Soviet Union face a common enemy, namely U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique of traitors. The Chinese people’s opposition to this small clique of Soviet revisionist traitors is the greatest support and aid to the Soviet people who are under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and it fully embodies the proletarian internationalism of the Chinese people.

	China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a surging torrent, is crashing against the dikes of all reactionary forces in the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is terrified to death, and they are desperately distorting and slandering this Great Revolution in the Soviet Union, falsely claiming that in China, “a movement hostile to the Soviet people is being carried out.” Pfft, shameless traitors, shut your filthy mouths! Under the leadership of our great helmsman Chairman Mao, the billion revolutionary people of China have launched this Great Revolution, rooting out the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, those Khrushchev-like figures, and smashing them to the ground, ensuring that China’s proletarian heaven remains forever red. We believe that the Soviet people will also be inspired by China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and will rise up to smash those Khrushchev-like figures to the ground, making sure they never rise again. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique of traitors is the common enemy of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. The peoples of China and the Soviet Union must unite to rebel against you, raise our iron fists, and smash this gang of Lenin’s traitors to smithereens!

### “毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”

　　“毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”
　　北京大学　洪斌
    “毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”这是苏联人民对伟大列宁的无限深情的怀念，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限敬仰的心声！
    “毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”这就是轰鸣在天际的隐约可闻的惊雷，随之而来的急风暴雨，将要把苏联国土上的妖魔鬼怪通通扫光！
    苏联的天空乌云翻滚。苏修领导集团这一小撮背叛列宁的无耻叛徒，他们大反斯大林，大肆歪曲和阉割列宁主义，在苏联大干特干复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当。一个好端端的革命的苏联，被糟踏得不成样子，苏联的无产阶级专政变成了资产阶级专政。苏联人民怀着愤怒的心情，眼看着窃踞克里姆林宫的这一伙叛徒砍倒了列宁的旗帜，他们是多么渴望拨开乌云，重新见到红太阳啊！
    世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。正是毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。二十世纪初叶，马克思主义发展到了列宁主义的阶段。现时代，又发展到了毛泽东思想的新阶段。毛泽东思想的光芒照耀着风雷激荡的五洲四海，温暖着全世界革命人民的心！特别是毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，激起了苏联人民从修正主义的反革命统治下重新解放出来的希望。苏联人民怎能不无限热爱、无限敬仰世界革命人民的导师毛主席呢！
    苏修这一伙叛徒，既然丧心病狂地大反斯大林，大砍列宁主义的红旗，他们也就自然地要从他们反动阶级的本能出发，恶毒地攻击我们的伟大领袖毛主席，疯狂地仇视战无不胜的毛泽东思想。但是，曾经受过列宁和斯大林亲自教导和哺育的广大苏联人民，他们象热爱列宁一样，热爱毛主席。不论苏修领导集团怎样封锁，怎样禁止，苏联人民非常渴望得到毛主席的宝书。请听，在苏修叛徒集团的黑暗统治下，苏联普通的劳动者向中国同志说：“我要毛泽东的书！”“苏联人民需要这本书！”这是苏联人民渴求真理的呼声，是苏联劳动人民发自肺腑的声音！苏修这一伙无耻的叛徒，永远休想把毛主席的伟大形象从苏联人民心目中移走，就象他们休想把列宁的伟大形象从苏联人民心目中移走一样！
    十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义；中国无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，毛泽东思想在全世界得到更广泛的传播。相隔半个世纪，两声震天动地的炮响，两个巨人——伟大的列宁和毛主席把中苏两国人民的命运紧紧联系在一起了！
    中苏两国人民的革命友谊是牢不可破的。因为这种革命的友谊是列宁和他的亲密战友斯大林哺育起来的，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育起来的。
    今天，中苏两国人民面临着共同的敌人，即美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团这一小撮叛徒。中国人民反对苏修这一小撮叛徒，也就是对处于资产阶级专政下的苏联人民的最大支持和援助，也就最充分地体现了中国人民的无产阶级国际主义精神。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，象汹涌奔腾的洪流，冲击着全世界一切反动势力的堤坝。苏修领导集团怕得要死，他们在苏联人民中间拚命歪曲和诬蔑中国的这场大革命，胡说什么在中国，“正在进行着敌视苏联人民的运动。”呸，无耻的叛徒，闭上你们的臭嘴！中国亿万革命人民在我们伟大统帅毛主席的领导下发动了这场大革命，把中国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，那些赫鲁晓夫式的人物揪了出来，把他们打翻在地，使中国的无产阶级江山永远保持红色。我们相信，苏联人民也必将从中国无产阶级文化大革命得到启发，一定会起来把那些赫鲁晓夫式的人物通通打翻在地，叫他们永世不得翻身。苏修领导集团这一小撮叛徒是中苏两国人民的共同敌人。中苏两国人民就是要团结起来，造你们的反，举起铁拳，把苏修这一伙列宁的叛徒，砸得粉身碎骨！
