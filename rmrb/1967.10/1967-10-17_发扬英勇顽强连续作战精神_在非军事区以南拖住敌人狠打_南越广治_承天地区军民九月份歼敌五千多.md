The liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have recently launched a fierce offensive south of the demilitarized zone, inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S. Marine Corps and causing them to retreat in disarray.

According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilian population in the Quang Tri-Da Nang region south of the demilitarized zone engaged in continuous intense battles throughout September, killing, wounding, and capturing over 5,000 enemy personnel, including 3,500 American soldiers. They also destroyed or damaged 190 military vehicles and shot down 26 enemy aircraft.

The liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Da Nang region have fully demonstrated the spirit of the people's army being brave and tenacious in continuous combat, relentlessly striking the enemy. On September 17th and 19th, the liberation armed forces ambushed several companies of U.S. Marines in the Kun Tian area, killing 240 enemy soldiers. On the night of September 20th, they suddenly attacked the U.S. military outpost in Kun Tian with concentrated artillery fire, killing over 100 American soldiers. The next morning, the liberation armed forces surrounded a company of American soldiers on the road from Bai Shan to Kun Tian, killing and wounding many enemies. That afternoon, they ambushed two companies of American soldiers southeast of Kun Tian, killing and wounding over 150 enemy soldiers. The artillery units of the liberation armed forces played a powerful role in these battles, posing a significant threat to the enemy. On the night of September 12th, the artillery units simultaneously launched fierce artillery strikes on enemy outposts in Quang Tri City, La Vang, Chau Phong, and Hai Ling, killing 200 enemy soldiers. On the night of September 13th, they again conducted artillery strikes on enemy outposts in Kun Tian, Dong He, and Cam Lu, killing a large number of enemy soldiers. From September 19th to 25th, the artillery units concentrated their firepower on the U.S. military outpost in Kun Tian, launching continuous and fierce bombardments, killing over 700 enemy soldiers.

The fierce offensive by the liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Da Nang region has left the U.S. invading army with heavy casualties, unable to defend themselves. The U.S. Marine Corps commander exclaimed that they were in danger of being attacked like Dien Bien Phu and urgently requested reinforcements from the U.S. military command in Vietnam. They even issued orders not to allow wounded soldiers to leave the battlefield to make up for the shortage of troops. The U.S. military command in Vietnam was in a state of panic, having to resort to desperate measures. They hastily dispatched two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion of the Marine Corps from south of Da Nang to the area south of the demilitarized zone for reinforcement, and also moved a brigade of the First Cavalry Division from the central region to south of Da Nang to take over the defense.

However, as soon as this brigade of the First Cavalry Division arrived, it was met with a fierce counterattack by the liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province. According to reports, the base of this unit was bombarded by concentrated artillery fire from the liberation armed forces on the night of October 10th. Following the artillery support, the infantry of the liberation armed forces broke through the enemy's position, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In recent days, the liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province have closely coordinated with the brotherly units south of the demilitarized zone, actively launching attacks, tying down, and annihilating the enemy. On October 8th, they ambushed a company of paratroopers from the U.S. 101st Airborne Division in heavy rain, using bayonets and grenades to kill many enemy soldiers.

Currently, the liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Da Nang region, in coordination with brotherly units on various battlefields, are advancing in victory, striving to achieve more victories in the latter part of the rainy season.

　　发扬英勇顽强连续作战精神  在非军事区以南拖住敌人狠打
　　南越广治—承天地区军民九月份歼敌五千多
    新华社河内电　越南南方解放武装力量最近在非军事区以南发动的猛烈攻势，打得美国海军陆战队伤亡惨重，狼狈不堪。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，非军事区以南广治—承天地区的军民九月份在连续的激烈战斗中，共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人五千多名，其中包括美军三千五百名，击毁击伤军车一百九十辆，击落敌机二十六架。
    广治—承天地区解放武装力量在这一攻势中高度发扬了人民军队英勇顽强、连续作战的精神，不断猛烈打击敌人。解放武装力量九月十七日和十九日在昆天地区连续两次伏击美国海军陆战队的几个连，歼敌两百四十名以后，二十日夜间又突然兵临昆天美军据点，以密集的炮火杀伤了美军一百多名。第二天早晨，解放武装力量在拜山到昆天的公路上包围美军一个连，打死打伤很多敌人，当天下午，又在昆天东南伏击美军两个连，杀伤敌人一百五十多名，解放武装力量炮兵部队在这些战斗中发挥了强大的威力，给予敌人重大的威胁。炮兵部队在十二日夜间同时对广治市、拉汪、兆丰、海陵等敌军据点发起猛烈炮击，歼敌两百名，接着在十三日夜间又对昆天、东河、甘露等敌军据点进行炮击，杀伤大量敌人。从十九日到二十五日，炮兵部队又突然集中对昆天美军据点进行连续猛烈的轰击，杀伤敌人七百多名。
    广治—承天地区解放武装力量这一猛烈的攻击，打得美国侵略军伤亡累累，无法招架。美国海军陆战队头目惊呼他们“随时有受到奠边府式进攻的危险”，要侵越美军司令部赶快派救兵去，还下了命令不准轻伤员离开战场，以弥补兵力的不足。侵越美军司令部更是惊慌万状，不得不挖肉补疮，把在岘港以南的海军陆战队两个步兵营和一个炮兵营急忙调到非军事区以南去增援，又把中部地区的第一骑兵师的一个旅调到岘港以南去接防。
    但是，第一骑兵师的这个旅刚刚调到那里，就遭到了广南省解放武装力量的迎头痛击。据报道，这个旅的一支部队的基地十日夜间遭到了解放武装力量炮兵密集炮火的轰击。接着，在炮火的支援下，解放武装力量步兵又突破了这支美军的阵地，给予敌人重大的杀伤。这些天来，广南省解放武装力量密切配合非军事区以南兄弟部队的战斗，积极出击，牵制和消灭敌人。他们八日在倾盆大雨中伏击了美国第一○一空降师的一连伞兵，用刺刀和手榴弹消灭了很多敌人。
    现在，广治—承天地区解放武装力量在各战场兄弟部队的配合下，正在乘胜前进，争取在雨季的后期中打更多的胜仗。
