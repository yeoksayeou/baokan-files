	“Count the heroes of the past, and look to the present.”
	Today, the invincible light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the five continents and four seas, ushering in a great new era of Mao Zedong Thought!
	Today, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. The bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev has been thoroughly defeated and is in complete collapse.
	Today, the great People's Liberation Army of China, following the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, is fighting along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao to defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group.
	Today, the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought is nurturing a new generation. They are both vanguards in criticizing revisionism and pioneers in fighting selfishness. Countless good soldiers of Chairman Mao are rapidly growing.
	Since this year, in Shanxi's Datong and the northern plateau of Shanxi, tens of thousands of Red Guards revolutionary youngsters and proletarian revolutionary comrades have enthusiastically praised the heroic deeds of Chairman Mao's good soldier, Year Four-Wang.
	Year Four-Wang is a soldier from the 10th Company of a certain engineering unit of the General Logistics Department in Shanxi Province. He loves, is loyal to, believes in, and admires our great leader Chairman Mao without limit. In a critical moment when people's lives were in serious danger, he bravely stepped forward to rescue a passenger train and was seriously injured. Even after his memory was severely damaged, he still remembered Chairman Mao, sang "The East Is Red," and recited quotations from Chairman Mao, setting a good example for us in being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	Heart with an Eternal Red Sun
	On the fourth day of his hospitalization, Year Four-Wang woke up from his coma.
	Four days earlier, Year Four-Wang was seriously injured. Doctors diagnosed him with severe cranial trauma, and his life was in danger. The news reached Beijing, and the leaders of the General Logistics Department immediately sent a plane with doctors to start an urgent rescue operation.
	Four days had passed, such a long time! In the hallway, in the ward, the footsteps of miners, Red Guards, military leaders, and company comrades came and went, came and went again. Those who volunteered to donate blood for Year Four-Wang came and went, went and came again. Everyone couldn't eat well or sleep peacefully, counting every second: Year Four-Wang, dear comrade! When will you wake up?
	“He's awake! Year Four-Wang is awake!”
	Comrades finally woke Year Four-Wang up! The nurse pointed to the comrades entering from the door and said, “Little Year, look, who's here?” Year Four-Wang opened his eyes but had no response. She called him again, but Year Four-Wang still had no reaction, his face showing no expression. The nurse's gaze turned to the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao hanging on the opposite wall. Ah! Chairman Mao is also looking at our Year Four-Wang! She excitedly shouted:
	“Little Year, look, Chairman Mao is here!”
	Year Four-Wang's eyes quickly opened. He looked at the comrades but didn't recognize any of them. But when he saw the portrait of Chairman Mao, his eyes widened, and with deep emotion, he said softly and with difficulty:
	“Chairman Mao…”
	“Chairman Mao!” After days of coma, Year Four-Wang woke up and the first person he recognized was Chairman Mao! His first words were “Chairman Mao!” This heartening news quickly spread throughout the hospital, the barracks, and the city of Datong. People from all directions rushed to visit him, but Year Four-Wang fell into a coma again.
	For several days, Year Four-Wang only moved his body occasionally and opened his eyes. He didn't know hunger or thirst, nor did he feel cold or heat. The nurse put orange slices in his mouth, but he didn't know how to chew or swallow. His cerebrospinal fluid was still leaking, his life was still in danger, and his consciousness had not yet recovered. From morning to night, he was always in a state of sleep! Sleep…
	On this day, Year Four-Wang woke up from his sleep again. The nurse was overjoyed and excitedly said, “Little Year, come, let's sing a song together!” She sang the first line: “The East Is Red—”
	The loudest song is “The East Is Red,” and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong. A red sun rose in Little Year's eyes, and his face showed boundless happiness as he sang:
	The East Is Red, the sun rises,
	China has given birth to Mao Zedong…
	Year Four-Wang's voice was sometimes high and sometimes low, interrupted, but he insisted on singing the entire song. Every word, every note, was filled with his deep love for our great leader Chairman Mao.
	After several more comas, the following appeared on Year Four-Wang's medical record:
	“Today, his spirit is very good, and he can eat.”
	“Today, he sang ‘Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman’ again.”
	Can he write? One morning, the doctor brought a piece of paper and handed a pencil to Year Four-Wang, saying softly, “Little Year, write a character! Write your name!”
	Year Four-Wang, not yet fully awake, took the pencil, thought for a moment, and then wrote seriously and carefully, stroke by stroke. One character was written, two characters were written, three shining golden characters were written:
	Chairman Mao.
	Comrades looked at the three strong and powerful characters, as if seeing Year Four-Wang's burning red heart, hearing Year Four-Wang's voice from the bottom of his heart!
	Year Four-Wang's consciousness was beginning to recover, but he was still in a semi-comatose state. When shown photos of his family, he didn't recognize anyone; when his “Red Couple” who had been with him day and night held his hand, he still shook his head lightly, not remembering who they were. The platoon leader, Zhu Yangsheng, thought, if he doesn't remember his comrades, will he remember his parents? He asked softly, “Four-Wang, think carefully, who is in your family?”
	Year Four-Wang looked at the platoon leader, thought for a while, and affectionately replied:
	“There is Chairman Mao!”
	The platoon leader, deeply moved, continued to ask, “Where do you live?”
	“In Beijing!”
	Year Four-Wang was to be transferred to Beijing for treatment. Before leaving, his comrades all came to see him off. The political instructor, Yue Ningwen, said, “Comrade Four-Wang, I hope you will rest and recuperate, and determine to—” Year Four-Wang immediately continued, “Not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.”
	Year Four-Wang, our dear comrade! A severe brain contusion has damaged your memory, and you have forgotten everything, but you have not forgotten our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts! We have not forgotten the warm instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao!
	Year Four-Wang, our dear comrade! Parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao. You have only Chairman Mao in your heart, you have an eternal red sun in your heart!

	Chairman Mao Told Me to Serve the People
	Year Four-Wang was seriously injured while rescuing a passenger train.
	On the evening of December 31, 1966, Datong City was adorned with red flags and illuminated by bright lights, surging with the revolutionary fervor of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Although it was winter, the revolutionary spirit was like spring. In 1966, under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved continuous victories. Billions of revolutionary masses were jubilant, drumming war drums and singing victory songs, welcoming the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the new year.
	Year Four-Wang finished his business in the city and hurried back to the barracks. He sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, thinking about the New Year's Eve party his company was about to hold. He was also going to perform the “Reciting ‘In Memory of Norman Bethune’” act. Thinking of this, Year Four-Wang's heart was even sweeter, and his steps were even more joyful as he walked along the railway.
	It was completely dark. Year Four-Wang walked to the bend in the railway, crossed the tracks, and approached the ninth bridge.
	“Woo—!” came a deafening whistle. The 434th train from Kouquan Coal Mine to Datong, carrying the victories of the Cultural Revolution and revolutionary miners, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses, was speeding towards the ninth bridge.
	Year Four-Wang's sharp eyes focused on the front. He suddenly noticed a suspicious figure on the tracks. Looking closer, he saw a large stone on the rails. Year Four-Wang's mind flashed: at this critical moment of deepening class struggle, on the eve of the New Year, the class enemy is plotting to sabotage the train… He shouted, “Someone is sabotaging!” and immediately rushed over, grabbing the culprit and struggling with him. At this moment, the train was speeding towards the ninth bridge, getting closer and closer, only about thirty meters away from the large stone!
	In this critical moment, a loud and familiar voice called out, “We die for the people, and it is a worthy death.” Mao Zedong Thought commanded the soldier to rush forward! Year Four-Wang's blood boiled, his body was full of strength, and his deep class hatred condensed into a fist, striking the culprit down from the track. Then he rushed onto the track, facing the train, and ran towards it. The huge locomotive, thick smoke, strong light, and air pressure pressed towards Year Four-Wang. He remained calm, facing the train without fear. Just as he moved the heavy stone, the dark train rushed past him, and Year Four-Wang was knocked down.
	The passengers were safe, the train was safe, and the people's lives and property were saved. The long train stopped safely. Chairman Mao's good soldier, Year Four-Wang, was seriously injured. He lay unconscious by the railway…
	People rushed towards Year Four-Wang. Red Guards shouted, “Revolutionary comrades, this soldier saved the train!”
	An old miner, tears in his eyes, said excitedly, “Another Cai Yongxiang! Another good soldier of Chairman Mao!”
	Year Four-Wang was seriously injured and did not participate in the company's New Year's Eve party or perform the “Reciting ‘In Memory of Norman Bethune’” act; but he followed Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the people, writing a song of serving the people with his heroic deeds!

	Chairman Mao Told Me to Care About State Affairs
	Year Four-Wang was born into a poor peasant family in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province. Before liberation, his family had been working for landlords for generations. When he was three years old, his sister carried him to beg for food, enduring oppression and humiliation… In 1948, Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to liberate his hometown. When Year Four-Wang first received the red book—Chairman Mao's works—he wrote a vow: “Year Four-Wang, do not forget, do not forget the bitterness of the past class struggle, do not forget the sweetness of today's liberation!”
	In January 1966, Year Four-Wang, with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, and with a firm determination to defend Chairman Mao and the socialist cause, entered the army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Soon after enlisting, he wrote in his diary:
	Read Chairman Mao's books,
	Listen to Chairman Mao's words,
	Act according to Chairman Mao's instructions,
	Be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.
	Year Four-Wang loved reading Chairman Mao's books the most. He said, “Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books. We are descendants of poor peasants. If we do not read Chairman Mao's books, it is the greatest betrayal.” He studied diligently and used the teachings seriously. On duty outside, he insisted on reading every day on the train; sometimes after standing guard late at night, he would still study a few quotations from Chairman Mao under the streetlight; even after being injured, after a period of treatment, on the operating table, he insisted on reciting the “Three Constantly Read Articles”… He said, “If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, you won't see the revolutionary situation clearly and will go astray.” In the nearly four million words he wrote in his diary over a year, there are more than 390 places praising the great leader Chairman Mao, pouring out his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. He wrote: The more I read Chairman Mao's books, the more I love Chairman Mao; the more I love Chairman Mao, the more I love to read Chairman Mao's books.
	Year Four-Wang read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and walked the path guided by Chairman Mao. Last August, Chairman Mao issued the great battle call: “You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!” Year Four-Wang was moved and wrote in his diary: “Chairman Mao, this Cultural Revolution is personally led by you, and the Sixteen Points are personally formulated by you. I will definitely care about state affairs and always follow you to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.” At this time, the nationwide Red Guard movement arose, and they went into society, destroying the old and establishing the new. Year Four-Wang watched with joy and supported the Red Guards from the bottom of his heart. He said, “Chairman Mao's Red Guards, we must firmly support them!” During his hospitalization, Red Guard youngsters often visited him, and he always enthusiastically encouraged the Red Guards to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Red Commander Mao, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.
	The storm of class struggle raged within the Great Wall and along the Yangtze River. In the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, billions of revolutionary masses launched a total offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev ignited Year Four-Wang's indignation. He said: Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we will firmly carry out; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we will firmly fight against. He immediately joined the revolutionary criticism movement with a fighting posture. During his convalescence in the hospital, he endured the pain and wrote criticism articles overnight, fiercely criticizing revisionism. He wrote: “We must completely overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's backstage boss, China's Khrushchev, and make our country forever red!” This iron-clad vow condensed his boundless love for Chairman Mao and his deep hatred for China's Khrushchev!

	Chairman Mao Told Me to Fight Selfishness
	Chairman Mao teaches us, “The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation.” Vice Chairman Lin instructs, “We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful.” Comrade Year Four-Wang is following the instructions of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, constantly regarding himself as the object of the revolution and revolutionizing himself. Comrade Year Four-Wang realized that fighting selfishness is a difficult task of uprooting revisionism in one's soul. He must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and fight to the death with “selfishness,” letting “selflessness” take root. His experience in breaking selfishness and establishing selflessness is: fiercely study and use the “Three Constantly Read Articles,” fiercely fight against “selfishness” at the first thought. Catching “the first thought” is using Mao Zedong Thought to catch the sprouts of selfish thoughts in the depths of one's soul. Once, Year Four-Wang went to the twelfth platoon, and because the bedding was damp, he put the public raincoat under his own bedding. A comrade criticized him, saying, “Using the public raincoat is a small matter, but it is a matter of ‘public’ and ‘private.’” Year Four-Wang took this question to study “In Memory of Norman Bethune,” using the two measures of “completely” and “thoroughly” to repeatedly weigh, and found that when he took the raincoat, his mind had a “just use it, no big deal” thought, which he did not catch at the time. Now he understood that sleeping on the public raincoat was actually sleeping on “selfishness.” If he did not catch this “first thought,” it would allow “selfishness” to exist legally, and if he did not fiercely fight this “first thought,” it would allow “selfishness” to spread. Thinking of this, Year Four-Wang immediately took the raincoat out from under the bed. He thought, never underestimate this “first thought”!
	In the summer, the company was responsible for moving sleepers. After a few days, Year Four-Wang's shoulders were swollen, and his face was blistered. He looked at the still uncompleted pile of sleepers and thought, “When will we finish carrying these?” This thought just appeared, and he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, “The more difficult the place, the more we must go, this is a good comrade.” Chairman Mao's teaching gave Year Four-Wang endless strength. He picked the heaviest ones to carry and the ones with the most oil. His face was burned by the tar, and comrades asked him if it hurt. He happily replied, “It hurts, but it hurts comfortably!”
	Year Four-Wang's mind was filled with Chairman Mao's teachings, so his revolutionary standards were high, and he fought against “selfishness” even more consciously. More than a month before his heroic injury, the company was busy with the final work of the camp construction. On this day, a seven-level strong wind was blowing, and the cement on the roof quickly froze. Year Four-Wang stood on a scaffold more than ten meters high, laying bricks. A strong wind blew, and he slipped, almost falling down. He looked down and thought, “So high, if I fall, I'm done!” This “first thought” just appeared, and he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, “We die for the people, and it is a worthy death.” He feared falling, which meant fearing death, and serving the people could not fear death. He loudly recited, “Determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory.” He faced the wind, risked danger, and continued working on the roof. Later, the company made his deeds into a slide show. On the day the slide show was shown, comrades continuously applauded for him, but Year Four-Wang blushed and lowered his head. That night, he studied “In Memory of Norman Bethune” under a sliver of light from outside. The next day, at the platoon meeting, he voluntarily checked his “first thought” on the roof. Year Four-Wang was like this, following Chairman Mao's teachings to fight against “selfishness” and strive to change his worldview, advancing on the road of ideological revolution.

	Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!
	In the triumphant song of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on the grand occasion of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, Year Four-Wang's long-cherished wish finally came true. On October 1st, on Tiananmen Gate, Year Four-Wang stood beside our great leader Chairman Mao, basking in the boundless warmth of the sun in the hearts of the world's people. The most happiest moment has arrived! Chairman Mao, with his kind and affectionate face, warmly shook hands with Year Four-Wang! Ten thousand words surged in his heart, waves of emotion, and tears of joy. Year Four-Wang, with tears of happiness, looked up at Chairman Mao's kind and affectionate face, and with deep emotion, shouted, “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!”
	The road to the pass is like iron, but now we take the first step to cross it. On Tiananmen Gate, Year Four-Wang personally heard Vice Chairman Lin convey the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, and his heart was especially moved. He determined to most resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, be a vanguard in fighting selfishness, be a pioneer in criticizing revisionism, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight against “selfishness,” criticize “revisionism,” and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in his mind.

　　心里只有毛主席
　　——记毛主席的好战士年四旺
    “数风流人物，还看今朝。”
    今朝，战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉普照五洲四海，我们的世界进入了毛泽东思想的伟大新时代！
    今朝，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，被亿万革命群众打得落花流水，全面崩溃。
    今朝，伟大的中国人民解放军遵照以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫党中央，保卫中央文化革命小组而战斗。
    今朝，光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育着年青的一代，他们既作批修的先锋，又作斗私的闯将，千千万万个毛主席的好战士，正在迅速成长。
    今年以来，在山西大同，在晋北高原，成千上万的红卫兵革命小将和无产阶级革命派战友，热情传颂着毛主席的好战士年四旺的英雄事迹。
    年四旺，是总后勤部驻山西省某工程部队十连的战士。他对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。他在人民生命遇到严重危险的紧急关头，挺身而出，英勇抢救旅客列车，身负重伤。他在记忆力受到严重破坏的情况下，仍然念念不忘毛主席，歌唱《东方红》，背诵毛主席语录，为我们树立了忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的好榜样。
    心里有个永远不落的红太阳
    入院的第四天，年四旺从昏迷中醒过来了。
    四天前，年四旺负了重伤。医生诊断是重型颅脑损伤，他的生命处在垂危之中。消息传到北京，总后勤部的首长连夜派飞机送来了医生，展开了紧张的抢救工作。
    四天了，多么漫长啊！走廊里，病房里，看望他的矿工、红卫兵、部队首长和连队战友的脚步声近了又远，远了又近；要求为年四旺输血的同志们来了又去，去了又来。人们吃不好，睡不安，掐着指头一分一秒地计算着：年四旺啊，亲密的战友！你什么时候才能醒来？
    “醒了！年四旺醒了！”
      同志们到底把年四旺盼醒了！护士指着从门外进来的战友说：“小年，你看，谁来了？”年四旺睁了睁眼，没有回声。她又叫了一次，年四旺还是没有反应，脸上什么表情也没有。护士的目光转到了挂在对面的我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像。啊！毛主席他老人家也在看着我们的年四旺！她惊喜地喊道：
    “小年，你看，毛主席来了！”
    年四旺的眼睛很快睁开了。他看着同志们，一个也不认识。可是当他看到毛主席像的时候，他睁大了眼睛，怀着满心激动，轻轻地、吃力地说道：
      “毛——主——席——”
      “毛主席！”年四旺经过几天几夜的昏迷之后，醒来第一个认识的就是毛主席！第一句话就是“毛主席！”这个振奋人心的消息立刻传遍了医院，传遍了军营，传遍了大同市。人们从四面八方赶来看望他，可是，年四旺却又昏迷过去了。
    一连几天，年四旺只是有时动动身子，睁睁眼睛。他不知道饥渴，也不知道冷热。护士把橘子瓣放到他的嘴里，他不知道嚼，不知道咽。他的脑脊液仍在继续外流，他的生命仍处在危急之中，他的神智仍然没有恢复，从早到晚，一直是昏睡！昏睡……
    这一天，年四旺又从昏睡中醒过来了。护士高兴极了，激动地说：“小年，来，咱们一起唱个歌吧！”她先唱了第一句：“东方红——”
    最响亮的歌是《东方红》，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。小年眼前升起一轮红日，脸上呈现出无限幸福的感情，唱了起来：
    东方红，太阳升，
    中国出了个毛泽东……
    年四旺唱的声音时高时低，断断续续，坚持着唱完了这支歌。他唱的每一句、每一字、每一个音符，都充满了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情。
    又经过几度昏迷以后，在年四旺的病历表上出现了这样的记载：
    “今天精神很好，能吃东西了。”
    “今天又唱了《大海航行靠舵手》。”
    会说话了，能唱歌了，会不会写字呢？
    一天早晨，医生拿来一张纸，把铅笔递给年四旺，轻声地说：“小年，写个字吧！写一写你的名字！”
    还没有完全清醒的年四旺，接过笔，想了一想，就认真地、一笔一划地写起来。一个字写好了，两个字写好了，三个金光闪闪的大字写出来了：
    毛主席。
    同志们望着刚劲有力的三个字，象是看见了年四旺一颗火热的红心，听到了年四旺出自肺腑的声音！
    年四旺的神智虽然开始逐渐恢复，但是仍然处在半昏迷状态。把亲友的照片送到他眼前，他一个也不认识；朝夕相处的“一对红”拉着他的手，他还是轻轻摇头，想不起这是谁来。连长朱阳生心想，战友都不记得了，爹娘还记不记得呢？他轻声地问：“四旺，你好好想想，家里都有什么人呀？”
    年四旺望了望连长，想了一会，亲切地回答：
    “有毛主席！”
    连长激动万分地接着问：“你家住在哪里？”
    “在北京！”
    年四旺要转到北京去治疗。临走，战友们都来送行。指导员岳宁文说：“四旺同志，希望你安心休养，下定决心——”年四旺紧接着说：“不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    年四旺啊，我们亲爱的战友！严重的脑挫裂伤，破坏了你的记忆，什么都忘了，但是，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，你没有忘！我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教导，你没有忘！
    年四旺啊，我们亲爱的战友！爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。你心里只有毛主席，你心里有个永远不落的红太阳！
    毛主席叫我为人民服务
    年四旺是为抢救旅客列车而光荣负伤的。
    一九六六年十二月三十一日傍晚，大同市红旗招展，灯火辉煌，激荡着抓革命，促生产的革命热潮。虽然是严冬季节，但一派革命的气势“胜似春光”。一九六六年，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，无产阶级文化大革命捷报频传，亿万革命群众欢欣鼓舞，擂战鼓，奏凯歌，迎接无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的新的一年。
    年四旺在市里办完事，迈着快步回营房。他唱着毛主席语录歌，想着连队将要开的新年晚会，他还要表演《背诵〈为人民服务〉》的节目哩。想到这里，年四旺心更甜，脚步更欢，沿着铁路向前走。
    天色完全黑了。年四旺走到铁路拐弯的地方，跨过铁道，走近了九号桥。
      “呜——！”传来一声震耳的汽笛声，由口泉煤矿开往大同的434次客车，满载着文化大革命的胜利，满载着革命矿工、红卫兵小将和革命群众，飞驰而来。
    年四旺一双锐利的眼睛注视前方。他突然发现铁道上有一个行迹可疑的人。再细看，钢轨上放着一块大石头。年四旺脑子里一闪：在这阶级斗争深入发展的时候，在新年前夜，阶级敌人阴谋颠覆列车……他大喊一声：“有人破坏！”立即急奔过去，一把抓住了那个家伙，和他撕扭起来。这时候，列车高速度地冲着九号桥疾驰过来，越来越近，离大石头只有三十多米了！
    在这危急万分的刹那间，一个洪亮而又亲切的声音在召唤：“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛泽东思想指挥战士冲上去！年四旺热血沸腾，全身充满力量，满腔的阶级仇恨凝作一拳，狠狠地一击，将那个家伙打下了路基，然后冲上铁道，迎面朝火车冲去。巨大的车头、浓烟、强光、气浪，向着年四旺压来，他面不改色心不跳，刚刚搬开那块沉重的大石头，黑压压的火车冲到身边，年四旺被撞倒了。
    旅客安全，列车安全，人民的生命财产脱险了。长长的列车安安稳稳地停住了。毛主席的好战士年四旺身负重伤。他昏迷地倒在铁路旁边……。
    人们纷纷走向年四旺。红卫兵小将大声喊道：“革命的同志们，这位解放军战士抢救了火车！”
    一位老矿工，眼里闪着泪花，激动地说：“又一个蔡永祥！又一个毛主席的好战士！”
    年四旺负了重伤，没有参加连队的新年晚会，没有演出《背诵〈为人民服务〉》的节目；但是，他按照毛主席为人民服务的教导，以自己的英雄行为，谱写了一曲为人民服务的颂歌！
      毛主席叫我关心国家大事
    年四旺出生在安徽省怀远县的一个贫农家庭里。解放前，他家祖祖辈辈给地主扛活。他三岁的时候，姐姐就背着他讨饭，受尽了压迫，受尽了欺凌……一九四八年，毛主席派来解放军，解放了他的家乡。年四旺在第一次得到红彤彤的宝书——毛主席著作的时候，就写下了誓言：“四旺四旺不要忘，不忘过去阶级苦，不忘今日解放甜！”
    一九六六年一月，年四旺怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，抱着保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义江山的坚强决心，跨进了部队这所毛泽东思想大学校。入伍不久，他就在日记本上工工整整地写下了林副主席的指示：
    读毛主席的书
    听毛主席的话
    照毛主席的指示办事
    做毛主席的好战士
    年四旺最爱读毛主席的书。他说：“毛主席的书是闹革命的书，我们是贫农的后代，不读毛主席的书，就是最大的忘本。”他学得勤奋，用得认真。外出执勤，在火车上他坚持天天读；有时深夜站岗回来，也要在路灯底下学上几段毛主席语录；就是负伤以后，经过一段治疗，在手术台上，他也坚持背诵“老三篇”……。他说：“一天不读毛主席的书，就看不清革命形势，就会走到邪路上去。”在他入伍一年来写下的一百多篇近四万字的日记中，就有三百九十多处颂扬伟大领袖毛主席，倾注着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。他写道：我越读毛主席的书，就越热爱毛主席；越热爱毛主席，就越爱读毛主席的书。
    年四旺读的是毛主席的书，听的是毛主席的话，走的是毛主席指引的路。去年八月，毛主席发出了伟大的战斗号召：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”年四旺心情激动，在日记里写下了决心：“毛主席啊，毛主席，这场文化大革命是您老人家亲自领导的，十六条是您老人家亲手制定的。我一定要关心国家大事，永远紧跟您老人家，把文化大革命进行到底。”就在这个时候，震撼全国的红卫兵运动兴起了，他们走向社会，大破四旧，大立四新，年四旺看在眼里，喜在心头，打心眼里爱上了红卫兵。他说：“毛主席的红卫兵，我们要坚决支持！”他负伤住院期间，红卫兵小将经常来看望他，他总是热情地鼓励红卫兵小将读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，紧跟红司令毛主席，把文化大革命进行到底。
    长城内外风雷激，大江南北战歌起。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战中，亿万革命群众向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了总攻击。中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，激起了年四旺的满腔怒火。他说：符合毛泽东思想的，我们坚决照办；不符合毛泽东思想的，我们坚决斗争。他以战斗的姿态，立即投入了革命大批判运动。在医院休养的过程中，他忍着伤痛，连夜赶写批判稿，狠批修正主义。他写道：“一定要把反革命修正主义分子的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫彻底打倒，叫我们国家世世代代永不变色！”这钢铁般的誓言，凝聚着对毛主席的无限热爱，凝聚着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨！
    毛主席叫我狠斗“私”字
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。林副主席指示：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”年四旺同志就是遵照毛主席和林副主席的指示，不断地把自己当作革命的对象，自己革自己的命。年四旺同志认识到，斗私，是在自己灵魂深处挖修正主义根子的艰巨的战斗任务，要用毛泽东思想为武器，和“私”字刺刀见红，让“公”字安家落户。他破私立公的体会是：狠学狠用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字“一闪念”。抓“一闪念”，就是用毛泽东思想抓自己灵魂深处私心杂念的小苗苗。有一次，年四旺来到十二班，因铺板泛潮，他把公用雨布垫在自己铺上。有个同志提出批评说：“垫公用雨布事情虽小，可是个‘公’和‘私’的问题啊！”年四旺带着这个问题学习《为人民服务》，用“完全”、“彻底”两把尺子反复衡量，发现在拿雨布时，头脑里有过“用一用没有啥”的“一闪念”，当时没有抓住它。现在明白了，睡在公用雨布上，实际上是躺在“私”字上。不抓住这个“一闪念”，就是允许“私”字合法存在，不狠斗这个“一闪念”，就是允许“私”字泛滥。想到这里，年四旺立即从床上把雨布抽了出来。他想，可千万不能小看这“一闪念”啊！
    盛夏，连队担任搬运枕木的任务。扛了几天，年四旺的肩膀压肿了，脸上爆皮了，他望着还没有搬完的一大堆枕木，心里闪出了一个念头：“什么时候才能扛完呀？”这个念头刚一出现，他就想起了毛主席的教导：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的教导，给了年四旺无穷的力量，他专拣重的扛，专拣油多的扛。脸被沥青烧卷了皮，同志们问他疼不疼？他愉快地回答：“疼是疼，但疼得舒服！”
    年四旺脑子里装着毛主席教导，革命化的标准就高，狠斗“私”字“一闪念”就更加自觉。在他光荣负伤的一个多月以前，连队正忙着突击营建的收尾工程。这一天，刮着七级大风，砂浆运到房顶很快就冰住了。年四旺站在十多米高的脚手架上砌砖。一阵大风吹来，他双脚一滑，差一点摔下来。他往下一看，心想：“这么高，摔下去可就完了！”这个“一闪念”刚露头，他就想起毛主席的教导：“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”自己怕摔下来，就是怕死，为人民服务就不能怕死。他高声背诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他迎着大风，冒着危险，继续在房顶施工。后来连里把他的事迹画成了幻灯。放幻灯那天，同志们不断为他鼓掌，年四旺却红着脸，低着头。当天夜里，他借着外屋射进来的一线灯光，学习《为人民服务》。第二天，开班务会他主动地对自己在房顶上的“一闪念”作了检查。年四旺就是这样按毛主席教导狠斗“私”字，努力改造世界观，在思想革命化的道路上不断前进。
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中，在伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年国庆的盛大节日里，年四旺同志多年来最美好的愿望终于实现了。十月一日，在天安门城楼上，年四旺同志无限幸福地站在我们伟大领袖毛主席的身旁，沐浴着世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳无限温暖的阳光。最最幸福的时刻到来了！毛主席他老人家亲切地和年四旺同志握了手！千言万语涌心头，心潮逐浪热泪流。年四旺同志饱含幸福的热泪，仰望毛主席亲切慈祥的面容，无限深情地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。在天安门城楼上，年四旺同志亲自听到了林彪副主席传达伟大领袖毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的伟大号召，心里格外激动。他决心最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，作斗私的先锋，当批修的闯将，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想斗掉“私”字，批倒“修”字，在头脑里大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
