Albanian "Unity" Newspaper Strongly Condemns the Reactionary Forces in India and Indonesia for Stirring Up Anti-China Sentiment
The World's People Have Limitless Love and Trust for the Great China
Vietnamese "People's Daily" Condemns the Indonesian Reactionary Forces for Inciting Mob Attacks on Our Embassy

	New China News Agency, Tirana, October 9th - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on the 8th, strongly condemning the reactionary forces in India and Indonesia for stirring up anti-China sentiment.

	The commentary said that the American imperialists and their accomplices, the Khrushchev revisionists, are escalating the war in Vietnam on one hand, and on the other, they are frenziedly stirring up a despicable and shameful anti-China movement.

	The commentary pointed out that just as the 700 million Chinese people and their friends around the world are celebrating the great victory of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists' shameless lackeys organized a shameful provocation against the people of China. The Indian army's despicable provocation on the Sino-Sikkim border on October 1st, and the Indonesian mob's bandit-like attack on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and its staff, instigated and supported by the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique, are part of the imperialist and revisionist anti-China movement. The Indian reactionary government and the Indonesian fascist clique attempt to cover up their miserable situation—caused by their reactionary and anti-people policies—which has led to great chaos and the continuous expansion of the people's resistance and struggle against their bloody rule, through such shameful provocations.

	The commentary pointed out that no matter how hard the Delhi and Jakarta governments try, they cannot deceive anyone. Their shameful provocations against the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people not only failed to extinguish but further promoted the revolutionary struggle of the people in India and Indonesia; their provocations not only did not weaken but further increased the people's deep hatred for these traitorous reactionary cliques. At the same time, these provocations not only did not weaken but further enhanced the sympathy and respect of the people of various countries for the People's Republic of China, which unyieldingly holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, revolution, and proletarian internationalism, and for the glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong. As for the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people, they immediately gave these bandits and their backers a deserved retribution. The Indian army, under the orders of the Delhi government and its backers, crossed the Chinese border and was beaten back with bloody heads. The representatives of the Indian government, like drowned rats, went to the Chinese border to retrieve the bodies of Indian soldiers from the Chinese border guards and had to publicly admit that it was the Indian army that crossed the border and provoked China. In this way, the Delhi government's attempt to defame China and falsely accuse the Chinese border guards of provocation on the border was once again exposed.

	The commentary highly praised the brave struggle of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia against the mob. The commentary said that although the embassy staff were few in number and were in a foreign country, they bravely defended themselves. With their firm and brave stance, they won the sympathy of the people and further enhanced the limitless love and trust of the Indonesian people for the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi - The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 3rd, strongly condemning the Indonesian reactionary authorities for inciting mob attacks on the Chinese Embassy and injuring Chinese diplomatic personnel.

	The commentary said that the Indonesian authorities must take responsibility for this brutal fascist act that occurred precisely on China's National Day. This atrocity grossly violated the safety and inviolability of diplomatic personnel and international conventions, and was a serious provocation.

	The commentary pointed out that in the past year, various reactionary forces in Indonesia have increasingly intensified their opposition to China. The October 1st attack on the Chinese Embassy further proves that various reactionary forces in Indonesia are plotting to strengthen their anti-China movement and deliberately lead to the destruction of relations between the two countries.

	The commentary concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people fully support the correct stance of the Chinese government and people. The Indonesian authorities must stop all actions against China.

    新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》八日发表评论，强烈谴责印度和印度尼西亚反动派掀起的反华逆流。
    评论说，美帝国主义者及其帮凶赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，一方面在越南进行战争升级，另一方面继续疯狂地掀起卑鄙无耻的反华运动。
    评论指出，正当七亿中国人民及其世界上的朋友欢庆中华人民共和国成立十八周年的伟大胜利时，帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的无耻仆从组织了对人民中国的可耻挑衅。印度军队十月一日在中锡边界的无耻挑衅，印度尼西亚暴徒在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯集团唆使和支持下对中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆及使馆人员进行的强盗袭击，是帝、修反华运动的组成部分。印度反动政府和印度尼西亚法西斯集团企图通过这种无耻的挑衅，来掩盖一下他们的可怜处境——因奉行反动的和反人民的政策而造成的巨大混乱和本国人民对他们的血腥统治的不断扩大的反抗和斗争。
    评论指出，不管德里和雅加达政府如何煞费心机，也骗不了任何人。他们对人民中国和伟大的中国人民的无耻挑衅不仅没有扑灭而且更加促进了印度和印度尼西亚两国人民的革命斗争；他们的挑衅不但没有减弱而且更加增加了人民对这些卖身求荣的反动集团的深仇大恨。同时，这些挑衅不但削弱不了，反而进一步提高了各国人民对不屈不挠地高举马克思列宁主义、革命和无产阶级国际主义旗帜的中华人民共和国和以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的同情和尊敬。至于人民中国和伟大的中国人民，则立刻给了这些强盗及其后台老板以应得的回击。在德里政府及其后台老板命令下越过中国边界的印度军队，碰得头破血流。印度政府的代表象落汤鸡一样，到中国边界内向中国边防当局领回印军尸体，并不得不公开承认是印度军队越过边界对中国进行了挑衅。这样一来，德里政府妄图丑化中国、胡说什么中国边防部队在边界进行挑衅的诽谤，就再次真相大白了。
    评论高度赞扬中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆工作人员的英勇抗暴斗争。评论说，使馆人员尽管人数很少，又是身居外国，但是他们英勇地进行了自卫。他们以自己的坚定而勇敢的立场，赢得了人民的同情，更加提高了印度尼西亚人民对中华人民共和国和伟大的中国人民的无限热爱和信任。
    新华社河内电　越南《人民报》三日发表评论，强烈谴责印度尼西亚反动当局唆使暴徒袭击中国大使馆、打伤中国外交人员的法西斯暴行。
    评论说，印尼当局必须对恰恰在中国国庆节发生的这一残暴的法西斯行动承担责任。这一暴行粗暴地违反了外交人员的安全和不可侵犯的权利，违反了国际惯例，这是严重的挑衅行动。
    评论指出，在近一年内，印尼的各种反动势力日益加紧反对中国。十月一日袭击中国大使馆事件，进一步证明了印尼各种反动势力正在策划加强反对中国的运动，蓄意导致破坏两国之间国家关系的地步。
    评论最后说，越南人民完全支持中国政府和人民的正确立场。印尼当局必须停止反对中国的一切行动。
