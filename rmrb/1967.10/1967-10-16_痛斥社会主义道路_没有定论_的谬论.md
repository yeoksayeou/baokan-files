In 1966, China's Khrushchev shouted at the top of his lungs: "Taking the socialist path, from the perspective of the entire humanity and the whole world, is still in the experimental stage. We are also experimenting, and we do not know whether it will be good or bad in the future. It may still go through twists and turns, so there is no conclusion." What a "experimental stage"! What a "no conclusion"! This is a thorough and complete fallacy of revisionism!

Chairman Mao said: "Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat, and at the same time, it is a new social system. This ideological system and social system are distinct from any other ideological system and any other social system. It is the most complete, most progressive, most revolutionary, and most rational system since the beginning of human history."

Socialism is the primary stage of communism. Through the socialist society, humanity will enter the communist society, which is an inevitable historical trend. The socialist system, compared to the capitalist system, has unparalleled superiority. "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people." This is the conclusion, this is the conclusion of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

As early as more than a century ago, Marx and Engels analyzed the inherent contradictions of the capitalist society, summarized the experience of the international workers' movement, and turned socialism from utopianism into a science. Over the past hundred years, the history of the international communist movement has been a glorious history of the world's proletariat bravely, tenaciously, and unremittingly fighting for the socialist revolution and continuously achieving great victories.

Lenin inherited the great cause of Marx and Engels, developing Marxism to the stage of Leninism. Lenin analyzed the monopolistic, decadent, and dying capitalism, that is, the unprecedented sharp contradictions unique to imperialism, summarized the new experience of the international communist movement, and waged a resolute struggle against Bernstein, Kautsky, Plekhanov, and the like. He proposed the theory that the socialist revolution can first achieve victory in one country and turned it into a reality in Russia. The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era of transition from capitalism to socialism and ushered in a new chapter of the world proletariat's socialist revolution. During the period of Lenin and Stalin's leadership, the Soviet people achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, fully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority and great vitality of the socialist system.

Our great leader Chairman Mao summed up the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship at home and abroad, especially studied the serious lessons of the complete restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, and correctly, comprehensively, and creatively solved a series of major issues of the contemporary proletarian revolution. He solved the theoretical and practical issues of how to carry the socialist revolution through under the condition of the proletarian dictatorship, thus developing Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

However, China's Khrushchev still blabbers in the 1960s about how "taking the socialist path, from the perspective of the entire humanity and the whole world, is still in the experimental stage" and that there is "no conclusion." This is a shameful betrayal of the October Revolution path and a shameful betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

China's Khrushchev talks nonsense about how the socialist path is "also in the experimental stage," and we still do not know whether it is "good or bad," and there is still "no conclusion," etc. This is a public denial of the glorious path of the Chinese revolution opened by our great leader Chairman Mao and directs the counter-revolutionary spearhead straight at the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought. What is tolerable, what is not tolerable!

The entire history of China and the entire practice of the Chinese revolution tell us: "Only socialism can save China."

China indeed had many "experiments." Since 1840, when China became a semi-colonial country, many progressive Chinese people had actively sought truth from the Western countries, attempting to establish a bourgeois democratic republic in China. However, "the invasion of imperialism shattered the Chinese people's dream of learning from the West."

"The October Revolution fired a cannon shot that sent us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the world, including China, to use the worldview of the proletariat as a tool to observe the fate of the nation and re-examine their own problems. To follow the path of the Russians—that was the conclusion." Under the command of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people achieved a thorough victory in the new democratic revolution and, upon the completion of the democratic revolution, embarked on the path of the socialist revolution.

Over the past eighteen years, under the guidance of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, we have not only on the economic front but also on the political and ideological fronts persisted in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, achieving great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has defended the socialist achievements of our country and will make the socialist mountains and rivers of the motherland last for thousands of years and never change color. China, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has become a strong bastion of world socialism and a powerful base for world revolution.

In fact, China's Khrushchev has long been an old opportunist who betrayed socialism. Previously, he vigorously advocated the fallacy of the "peaceful democratic new stage," attempting to strangle the new democratic revolution and keep China in a semi-colonial, semi-feudal state forever. Now, he is again spreading the clichés that the socialist path is still in the "experimental stage" and has "no conclusion," with the aim of fundamentally denying the path of the October Revolution, denying the path of the Chinese revolution, denying the great achievements of the Chinese socialist revolution and socialist construction, and denying the theory and practice of Chairman Mao's personal summary of consolidating and developing the socialist system and preventing the restoration of capitalism.

China's Khrushchev's so-called theory that the socialist path is still in the "experimental stage" and has "no conclusion" is an unadulterated fallacy of creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. It is a direct opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and an attack and slander on the great cause of the socialist revolution. He wants to carry out the restoration of capitalism in China and other socialist countries and maintain the rule of capitalism forever in other regions of the world, thus serving the anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary policies of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

To strive for the ultimate victory of socialism and communism in the world is the most sacred duty of all Marxists-Leninists and all true communists. China's Khrushchev's so-called theory that the socialist path is still in the "experimental stage" and has "no conclusion" has precisely given a conclusion for himself: China's Khrushchev is a great traitor to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a great traitor to the international communist movement.

Our era is the great era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the worldwide victory of socialism. Chairman Mao said: "Opportunists who try to obstruct the tide, although they are almost everywhere, the tide is unstoppable. Socialism is advancing to victory everywhere, throwing all stumbling blocks behind its back." Is not the failure of China's Khrushchev the best historical testimony to this?!

The great historical tide rolls on, unstoppable. Socialism will definitely achieve ultimate victory in the world!

　　痛斥社会主义道路“没有定论”的谬论
　　东方涛
    一九六六年，中国赫鲁晓夫声嘶力竭地叫嚷：“走社会主义道路从整个人类和全世界来讲，还只是试验阶段，我们也在试验，也不知将来是好还是不好，可能还要经过曲折，所以没有定论。”好一个“试验阶段”！好一个“没有定论”！这是彻头彻尾的修正主义谬论！
    毛主席说：“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。”
    社会主义是共产主义的低级阶段。经过社会主义社会，人类将进入共产主义社会，这是历史的必然。社会主义制度比较资本主义制度，具有无比的优越性。“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”这就是定论，这就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的定论！
    早在一个多世纪以前，马克思和恩格斯就剖析了资本主义社会所固有的各种矛盾，总结了国际工人运动的经验，使社会主义由空想变成了科学。一百多年来的国际共产主义运动史，就是全世界无产阶级为社会主义革命进行英勇顽强、坚持不懈的斗争，并不断取得伟大胜利的光辉历史。
    列宁继承了马克思、恩格斯的伟大事业，把马克思主义发展到了列宁主义阶段。列宁分析了垄断的、腐朽的、垂死的资本主义，即帝国主义所特有的一切空前尖锐的矛盾，总结了国际共产主义运动的新经验，同伯恩斯坦、考茨基、普列汉诺夫之流进行了坚决的斗争，提出了社会主义革命可以首先在一国胜利的学说，并把它在俄国变成了现实。伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了由资本主义向社会主义过渡的新时代，揭开了世界无产阶级社会主义革命的新篇章。在列宁、斯大林领导时期，苏联人民取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，这充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性和巨大生命力。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，总结了国际和我国无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是研究了苏联出现资本主义全面复辟的严重教训，正确地、全面地、创造性地解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列重大问题，解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下，如何把社会主义革命进行到底的理论和实践问题，从而把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想阶段。
    然而，中国赫鲁晓夫在二十世纪六十年代的今天，还胡说什么“走社会主义道路从整个人类和全世界来讲，还只是试验阶段”，还“没有定论”，这是对十月革命道路的可耻背叛，是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的可耻背叛！
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么社会主义道路“我们也在试验”，也还不知道“是好还是不好”，也还“没有定论”，等等，这是公开否定我们的伟大领袖毛主席所开辟的中国革命的光辉道路，把反革命锋芒直指光焰无际的毛泽东思想。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    中国的全部历史和中国革命的全部实践都告诉我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    中国也的确有过许多“试验”。自一八四○年中国沦为半殖民地以来，许多先进的中国人曾积极地向西方国家寻求真理，试图在中国建立西方的资产阶级民主共和国，但是，“帝国主义的侵略打破了中国人学西方的迷梦。”
      “十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”在我们的伟大领袖毛主席的统率下，中国人民取得了新民主主义革命的彻底胜利，并在民主革命一结束，就走上了社会主义革命的道路。
    十八年来，我们在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，不仅在经济战线上，而且在政治、思想战线上坚持了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，保卫了我国的社会主义成果，并将使祖国的社会主义江山千秋万代，永不变色。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的社会主义中国成了世界社会主义的坚强堡垒，成了世界革命的强大根据地。
    其实，中国赫鲁晓夫早就是背叛了社会主义的老牌机会主义者。以前，他极力鼓吹什么“和平民主新阶段”的谬论，妄图扼杀新民主主义革命，使中国永远维持半殖民地半封建的局面。现在，他又大肆散布社会主义道路还在“试验阶段”、还“没有定论”等滥调，其目的就是要从根本上否定十月革命的道路，否定中国革命的道路，否定中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，否定毛主席亲自总结的巩固和发展社会主义制度、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓社会主义道路还在“试验阶段”论、还“没有定论”论，是不折不扣地为资本主义复辟制造舆论的谬论，是直接反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是对伟大的社会主义革命事业的攻击和污蔑。他是要在中国和其他社会主义国家实行资本主义复辟，在世界其他地区永远维持资本主义的统治，从而为帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反共、反人民、反革命的政策效劳。
    为社会主义、共产主义事业在全世界的彻底胜利而奋斗到底，是一切马克思列宁主义者、一切真正共产党人最神圣的天职。而中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓社会主义道路还在“试验阶段”论，还“没有定论”论，恰恰给他自己做了定论：中国赫鲁晓夫是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大叛徒，是国际共产主义运动的大叛徒。
    我们的时代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的伟大时代。毛主席说：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”中国赫鲁晓夫的破产难道不就是最好的历史见证吗？！
    伟大的历史潮流滚滚向前，不可阻挡，社会主义一定要在全世界取得彻底胜利！
