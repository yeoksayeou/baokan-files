Resolutely Implement Revolutionary Great Unity According to Systems
Fully Play the Role of the Worker Class as the Main Force

Shanghai Municipal Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters

At this moment when the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has achieved decisive victories, and when a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out the "Criticize Revisionism, Repudiate Self" campaign is surging across the country, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group have issued a notice on implementing revolutionary great unity according to systems. This is a major measure of strategic significance to promote revolutionary great unity, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," to further deepen the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-reform in each unit, to seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, and to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. It is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We, the workers of Shanghai, resolutely support it, resolutely carry it out, and resolutely follow it!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything for the victory of the front line, organizational tasks must be subordinate to political tasks." The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has since March adjusted its grassroots organizations based on the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill and the spirit of achieving revolutionary great unity according to systems, industries, and departments. This ensures that the workers of Shanghai are always united under a unified and combat-effective revolutionary organization, smashing disturbances from both the "left" and the "right," and becoming a powerful pillar of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, which has proletarian authority. In the work of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," revolutionary criticism, struggle-criticism-reform, and "seizing the revolution and promoting production," we have achieved great successes. Practice has proven that the worker class can only achieve revolutionary great unity according to systems, industries, and departments to fully play the role of the worker class as the main force in the Cultural Revolution; to further enhance the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary organization; to effectively prevent bad elements from infiltrating and purify our ranks; to more powerfully develop and consolidate the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," to further deepen the revolutionary criticism, to do a good job in the struggle-criticism-reform of each unit; and to better implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." Today, when the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is deeply developing, implementing revolutionary great unity according to systems is of extremely important significance. This revolutionary great unity is the key to whether the revolutionary factions of the proletariat can unite the broad masses and cadres, truly do a good job in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and do a good job in the struggle-criticism-reform of each unit.

The process of achieving revolutionary great unity according to systems is a process of "criticizing revisionism, repudiating self." We must seriously study and deeply understand the great strategic significance of the central notice, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high tide, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "criticizing revisionism, repudiating self," seriously carry out self-criticism, deeply touch the soul, thoroughly uproot the "self," eliminate "small hills" in thought, develop and consolidate revolutionary great unity, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, do a better job in all aspects, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

　　坚决按照系统实行革命大联合
    充分发挥工人阶级主力军作用
　　上海市工人革命造反总司令部
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时刻，在全国波澜壮阔的活学活用毛主席著作和“斗私，批修”的新高潮中，中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革发出了关于按照系统实行革命大联合的通知。这是一项促进革命的大联合，革命的“三结合”，更深入地开展革命的大批判和各单位的斗批改，抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利的具有战略意义的重大措施，是毛主席的伟大战略部署的一个重要组成部分。我们上海工人阶级坚决拥护，坚决执行，坚决照办！
    毛主席教导我们：“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务”。我们上海工人革命造反总司令部，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，从今年三月份以来，在学习贵阳棉纺厂经验的基础上，根据按照系统、按照行业、按照部门实现革命大联合的精神，所属基层组织作了调整，从而保证了我们上海工人阶级始终团结在一个统一的有战斗力的革命组织中，粉碎了来自“左”、右两方面的扰乱，成为具有无产阶级权威的革命的三结合临时权力机构——上海市革命委员会的有力支柱。在革命的“三结合”，革命的大批判，斗批改，“抓革命，促生产”等各项工作中取得了很大的成绩。实践证明，工人阶级只有按系统、按行业、按部门实现革命的大联合，才能更充分地发挥工人阶级作为文化大革命主力军的作用；才能更加增强革命组织的战斗力；才能有效地防止坏人混入，纯洁我们的队伍；才能更有力地发展和巩固革命的“三结合”，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改；才能更好地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的今天，按系统实行革命的大联合，更具有极其重要的意义。这种革命大联合是无产阶级革命派能不能团结广大群众和干部，真正搞好革命的“三结合”，深入开展革命大批判，搞好本单位斗批改的关键。
    按系统实现革命大联合的过程，是“斗私，批修”的过程。我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会中央通知的伟大战略意义，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮，坚决贯彻毛主席“斗私，批修”最新指示，认真开展自我批评，狠触灵魂，狠挖“私”字，从思想上铲除“小山头”，发展和巩固革命的大联合，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，把各方面的工作做得更好，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
