Japanese revolutionary people have been holding meetings, parading, or issuing statements in various places over the past few days to denounce the fascist atrocities of the Sato government in dispatching police to kill the patriotic student Yamazaki Hiroshi and to express their determination to carry the anti-American patriotic struggle through to the end.

On October 13, Yamazaki Hiroshi's alma mater, Kyoto University, held a memorial service attended by more than 1,500 people. Student representatives and Kyoto University professor Nonomura Osamu delivered eulogies at the meeting. The student representative said in his eulogy that Yamazaki's sacrifice would promote more powerful struggles by the Japanese people. He said, "We will resolutely fight against the Sato government and force them to abolish the 'U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.'"

On the evening of October 13, more than 7,000 students and workers from Tokyo and the prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Saitama held a grand rally and demonstration at the Hibiya Open-Air Music Hall in the suburbs of Tokyo to protest against the Sato government's brutal suppression of patriotic students.

In Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, a conference was held on October 12 by the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party, the Minseinen (Left Faction), the Shimonoseki Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), and the Democratic Women's Federation. The revolutionary masses attending the conference angrily condemned the fascist crimes of the U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionaries. After the meeting, they held a parade and demonstration in the city and marched to the police authorities to lodge a strong protest.

In recent days, organizations such as the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Tokyo Mao Zedong Thought Study Group, and the Kyushu Region Committee (Revolutionary Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party in Fukuoka Prefecture have issued statements protesting the Sato government's killing of Yamazaki Hiroshi. They called on the revolutionary people: "Overthrow the Sato government!" "Avenge the martyr Yamazaki!"

In addition, many organizations and groups in various parts of Japan have held meetings or distributed leaflets to express their determination to fight against the Japanese reactionary government.

According to a report by the East China News Agency, more than 1,200 farmers, workers, and students in Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, bravely fought against more than 2,000 armed police who suddenly attacked to forcibly survey the airport site on the morning of October 10, foiling the enemy's plan to forcibly survey the site.

The farmers of Sanrizuka were well-prepared for the reactionary government's attack. After learning that the police were coming to attack, they beat iron pots to sound the alarm, and in an instant, more than a thousand farmers, workers, and students gathered from all directions, sitting and demonstrating at various key points.

When the fully armed Japanese police arrived, the farmers, workers, and students fought bravely against the armed police wielding batons. Two farmers were seriously injured, two were arrested, and many more farmers were injured.

However, the armed police, frightened by the farmers' brave struggle, had to flee in disarray after the survey team had only driven in three stakes.

In the afternoon of the same day, farmers, workers, and students held a large-scale meeting in Sanrizuka Park to angrily denounce the fascist atrocities of the Sato reactionary government in dispatching armed police. After the meeting, the crowd rushed to the Narita City police authorities, demanding the immediate release of the two arrested persons. The police authorities were forced to agree to release the arrested persons.

    新华社十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本各地革命人民，连日来纷纷举行集会、游行或发表声明，声讨佐藤政府出动警察杀害爱国学生山崎博昭的法西斯暴行，并且表示决心要把反美爱国斗争进行到底。
    山崎博昭烈士的母校——京都大学，十三日举行了有一千五百多人参加的追悼会。学生代表和京都大学女教授野村修在会上致悼词。学生代表在悼词中说，山崎的牺牲将促进日本人民更加有力的斗争。他说，“我们要向佐藤政府进行坚决的斗争，要迫使他们废除‘日美安全保障条约’。”
    十三日晚上，来自东京和千叶、神奈川、埼玉县的七千多名学生、工人，在东京郊外日比谷露天音乐堂举行了盛大集会和示威游行，抗议佐藤政府野蛮镇压爱国学生的暴行。
    在山口县的下关市，十二日由日本共产党下关地区委员会（左派）、民青（左派）、日中友好协会（正统）支部、民主妇人同盟联合召开了大会。参加会议的革命群众，愤怒地谴责了美帝和日本反动派的法西斯罪行。会后在市内举行游行示威，并拥向警察当局，提出强烈抗议。
    最近几天以来，日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）、日本国际贸易促进协会、东京毛泽东思想研究会、福冈县日本共产党（革命派）京筑地区委员会等组织纷纷发表声明，抗议佐藤政府杀害山崎博昭，他们向革命人民呼吁：“打倒佐藤政府！”“为山崎烈士报仇！”
    此外，在日本全国各地还有很多组织和团体举行集会或印发传单，表明他们向日本反动政府斗争的决心。
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本千叶县三里塚的农民、工人、学生一千二百多人，十日清晨英勇抗击两千多名前来强行测量机场的日本武装警察的突然袭击，挫败了敌人的强行测量计划。
    三里塚的农民对于反动政府的袭击早有准备。当农民知道了警察要来进攻的消息以后，就敲响铁桶发出警报，转眼之间一千几百名农民、工人、学生就从四面八方集合起来，他们分别在各条要道上静坐示威。
    当全副武装的日本警察开来之后，农民、工人、学生同挥舞警棍的武装警察展开了英勇的斗争。两个农民身负重伤，两名被逮捕，还有更多的农民负了伤。
    但是，被农民的英勇斗争吓破了胆的武装警察，在测量队仅仅钉了三个桩子之后，就不得不狼狈溜走。
    当天下午，农民、工人、学生等在三里塚公园举行大规模集会，愤怒谴责佐藤反动政府出动武装警察的法西斯暴行。会后群众一齐拥到成田市警察当局，要求立即释放两名被捕的人，警察当局被迫答应释放逮捕者的要求。
