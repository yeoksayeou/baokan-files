The surging waves of the revolutionary great criticism and the revolutionary great alliance are sweeping forward, and the revolutionary army is advancing victoriously with high spirits. The sound of victory songs echoes, and reports of victories are frequent. A vibrant and excellent situation is welcoming the great National Day.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." Eighteen years ago, we seized power from the hands of the reactionary Kuomintang. However, the enemy is not reconciled to their defeat; they are always trying to restore their power in China. The Chinese Khrushchev, together with a small clique of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, has formed a bourgeois headquarters, usurped part of the Party, government, economic, and cultural power, and is frantically carrying out conspiracies to subvert the proletarian dictatorship. Just as they were becoming complacent, our wise leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world, launching a fierce battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. With the outbreak of the "January Revolution" storm, many provinces and cities' proletarian revolutionary factions seized back the Party, government, economic, and cultural power from the hands of a small clique of those in power within the provincial and municipal Party committees who are taking the capitalist road. Currently, a powerful movement of great criticism and great alliance is flourishing, and a people's war to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters politically, ideologically, and theoretically is rising like a storm, swift and fierce. Facing such a great situation, how can we not be overjoyed!

The ship sails the sea with the helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. We carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution relying on Mao Zedong Thought. In this life-and-death class struggle, the broad masses of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers are learning Chairman Mao's works in a flourishing manner. Mao Zedong Thought is the absolute authority guiding everything! The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao is the authoritative command organization!

Under the direct command of the proletarian headquarters, we drove the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia down from their positions. Chairman Mao instructed us: "The revolutionary factions of the proletariat should unite and seize power from the small clique of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." We, the soldiers of the Third Command of the Red Guards in Hohhot, together with all the proletarian revolutionary factions in Inner Mongolia, under the direct command of the proletarian headquarters, repelled the February capitalist restoration countercurrent, smashed the underground black headquarters in Inner Mongolia, and established the Inner Mongolia Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Under Chairman Mao's call, on the eve of National Day, we, the Third Command of Hohhot, held our first Red Guard Congress, taking a solid step on the path of great unity. We do as Chairman Mao says. Chairman Mao's instructions are the magic weapon for us to defeat the enemy, achieve victory, and ensure that our country never changes color and that our power is forever in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. This is especially important for Inner Mongolia, which is on the frontline of anti-revisionism.

We, the proletarian revolutionary factions, enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution, and with our blood and lives, we defend this great victory. Furthermore, with the spirit of continuous revolution, we develop this victory. Therefore, we must be vigilant against arrogance and impetuosity, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and under the guidance of the policy of "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and criticizing and repudiating oneself," resolutely carry out the great criticism, great alliance, and "three-in-one combination," and thoroughly carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution in our units.

    欢呼胜利　发展胜利
　　内蒙古呼和浩特市红卫兵第三司令部
    奔腾急，万马战犹酣。革命大批判浪涛汹涌，革命大联合洪流滚滚，革命大军意气风发，乘胜挺进，战歌声声高，捷报频频传，一派热气腾腾的大好形势，迎来了伟大的国庆节。
    伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”十八年前，我们从国民党反动派的手里夺得了政权。但是，敌人不甘心于他们的失败，他们每日每时都企图在中国复辟。中国的赫鲁晓夫纠合党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，拼凑成了资产阶级司令部，篡夺了一部分党、政、财、文大权，猖狂地进行颠覆无产阶级政权的阴谋活动。正在他们得意忘形之时，我们英明的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，展开了一场如火如荼的彻底捣毁资产阶级司令部的战斗。随着“一月革命”风暴的掀起，许多省、市无产阶级革命派从省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里夺回了党、政、财、文大权。目前，一个声势浩大的革命大批判和大联合运动正在蓬勃发展，一场进一步从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的人民战争，正如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常地兴起。面对着这样的大好形势，我们怎能不欢欣鼓舞！
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。我们搞无产阶级文化大革命靠的是毛泽东思想。在这场你死我活的阶级搏斗中，广大工农兵革命群众学习毛主席著作蔚然成风。毛泽东思想是统帅一切的绝对权威！以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部是指挥一切的权威机构！
    我们在无产阶级司令部直接指挥下，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人赶下了台。毛主席指示我们：“无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权”，我们呼和浩特市三司战士和全体内蒙古无产阶级革命派一起，在无产阶级司令部直接指挥下，击退了二月资本主义复辟逆流，捣毁了内蒙古地下黑司令部，成立了内蒙古革命委员会筹备小组。毛主席指示我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”在毛主席号召下，在国庆节前夕，我们呼和浩特市三司召开了首届红代会，在大联合的道路上迈出了坚实的一步。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。毛主席的指示是我们战胜敌人，夺取胜利，使我们国家永不变色，使我们的政权永远掌握在无产阶级革命派手中的法宝。这对于处在反修前哨的内蒙古，更有特别重要的意义。
    我们无产阶级革命派，热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，用鲜血和生命保卫这个伟大胜利，并且以不断革命的精神去发展这个胜利。因此，我们必须戒骄戒躁，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在“斗私、批修”的方针指导下，坚决搞好革命的大批判、大联合、“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
