To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai. Our overseas expert, Comrade Zhang Mincai, died in the line of duty. A grand funeral was held in the capital of Tanzania.

The Tanzanian people praised Comrade Zhang Mincai as a good expert guided by Chairman Mao, demonstrating true internationalism.

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, DAR ES SALAAM, October 13 — Zhang Mincai, a Chinese water conservancy engineer and member of the Communist Party of China, who was helping Tanzania with its construction, died in the line of duty on October 8. His funeral was held in the afternoon of October 10 in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania.

When Zhang Mincai's ashes were sent to the cemetery, a long procession passed through the streets of Dar es Salaam. Several hundred Tanzanian friends and Chinese comrades attended the solemn funeral ceremony at the cemetery.

Tanzania's Minister of Lands, Settlement, and Water Development, Babu, and representatives from relevant departments of the Tanzanian government placed wreaths in front of Zhang Mincai's portrait. The Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Tanzania, Zhou Boqing, and Chinese experts working in Tanzania also placed wreaths.

Babu, representing Tanzania's Second Vice President Kawawa, attended the funeral and delivered a eulogy. He expressed deep sorrow over Zhang Mincai's death and extended sincere condolences to the Chinese people and Zhang Mincai's family. Babu read a quote from Chairman Mao: "People will die, but the significance of their death differs. An ancient Chinese writer named Sima Qian said, 'Death is certain, but some deaths are heavier than Mount Tai, while others are lighter than a feather.' To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather." He continued, "Zhang Mincai died according to Chairman Mao's teachings, sacrificing his life for the people's interests. He praised Zhang Mincai for being 'loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong.' Babu also praised Zhang Mincai as an 'outstanding and capable engineer' and a 'model worker.' He said, 'We should learn from his example of complete dedication to work and his sincere attitude towards and respect for the workers he worked with.' He concluded, 'We should work hard like this Chinese martyr and complete the work he left behind.'

Charge d'Affaires Zhou Boqing delivered a eulogy, stating that Comrade Zhang Mincai was a proletarian internationalist fostered by Mao Zedong Thought. He was a good son of the Chinese people and a good member of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Zhang Mincai died while fulfilling his internationalist duty, helping Tanzania with its economic construction, and promoting friendship between the two peoples. Zhang Mincai died a meaningful death, and his death is indeed heavier than Mount Tai.

Comrade Zhang Mincai, at the invitation of the Tanzanian government, arrived in Tanzania in August 1966 with other Chinese water conservancy experts. As a water conservancy engineer, he was responsible for the survey work of the Rufiji River Kihansi Hydropower Project.

On October 4, while he and his colleagues were measuring the cross-section of the Rufiji River's lower valley, they were suddenly attacked by a swarm of venomous bees. Due to severe poisoning from the stings, despite all efforts to save him, he passed away on October 8.

To save Comrade Zhang Mincai's life, Chinese experts and medical teams working in Tanzania, with the assistance and close cooperation of Tanzanian medical authorities and medical workers, worked day and night. Chinese embassy staff and other Chinese comrades also made every effort to ensure treatment.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, upon learning of Comrade Zhang Mincai's critical condition, specially dispatched medical experts from Beijing by plane to Dar es Salaam for treatment. Tanzanian government leaders, department heads, and friends also expressed great concern and provided tremendous help. In the past few days, many Tanzanian friends have expressed their condolences to the Chinese embassy over Comrade Zhang Mincai's death in the line of duty. Some said, "He died for our country and people." Others said, "Comrade Zhang Mincai, following Chairman Mao's teachings, demonstrated true internationalism." "The Tanzanian people will forever remember him."

　　为人民的利益而死比泰山还重
　　我援外专家张敏才同志因公牺牲，坦桑尼亚首都举行隆重葬礼
　　坦桑人民赞扬张敏才同志是毛主席教导的好专家，表现真正的国际主义精神
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十三日电　帮助坦桑尼亚建设的中国水利工程师、中国共产党党员张敏才同志在十月八日因公牺牲，他的葬礼十日下午在坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆举行。
    当张敏才同志的骨灰送往墓地时，长长的送葬队伍通过达累斯萨拉姆的街道。几百位坦桑尼亚朋友和中国同志参加了在墓地上举行的隆重葬礼。
    坦桑尼亚土地、定居和水利开发部长巴布和坦桑尼亚政府有关部门的代表在张敏才同志遗像前面献了花圈。中国驻坦桑尼亚大使馆临时代办周伯萍和在坦桑尼亚工作的中国专家们也献了花圈。
    巴布代表坦桑尼亚第二副总统卡瓦瓦参加葬礼，并致悼词。他对张敏才的牺牲表示深切哀悼，并且向中国人民、向张敏才的家属表示真诚的慰问。巴布读了毛主席的一段语录：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”他接着说：张敏才是按照毛主席的教导，为人民利益而牺牲自己的生命的。他赞扬张敏才“忠于伟大英雄毛泽东主席的英明领导”。巴布还赞扬张敏才是“杰出能干的工程师”，是“工人的模范”。他说：“我们应当学习他完全献身于工作和热忱对待和尊重同他一起工作的工人的良好榜样。”他最后说：“我们应当象这位中国烈士那样努力工作，完成他遗留下来的工作。”
    周伯萍临时代办致悼词说，张敏才同志是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的无产阶级国际主义战士。他是中国人民的好儿子，是中国共产党的好党员。张敏才同志是在履行国际主义义务，帮助坦桑尼亚进行经济建设，增进我们两国人民的友谊的时候牺牲的。张敏才同志死得其所，他的死的确比泰山还重。
    张敏才同志是应坦桑尼亚政府的邀请，于一九六六年八月间同其他中国水利专家一起到坦桑尼亚来的。他作为一个水利工程师，担任鲁伏河克洞达水利工程的勘察工作。
    今年十月四日，当他和其他同志正在测量鲁伏河下游河谷的横剖面时，突然受到成群的毒蜂的袭击。他由于被螫极度中毒，经竭力抢救无效，终于在十月八日逝世。
    为了挽救张敏才同志的生命，在坦桑尼亚工作的中国各专家组和医疗队的中国医生们，在坦桑尼亚医务当局和医务工作者的尽力协助和密切合作之下，曾经日夜工作。中国大使馆人员和其他专家等中国同志为保证治疗也做了一切努力。
    中国共产党和中国政府听到张敏才同志有生命危险，特地从北京派遣医疗专家乘飞机到达累斯萨拉姆为他治疗。坦桑尼亚政府领导人，有关部门负责人和朋友们也表示了极大的关切，给予巨大的帮助。几天来，许多坦桑尼亚朋友对张敏才同志的因公牺牲向中国大使馆表示哀悼。他们有的说：“他是为我们的国家和人民而死的。”有的说：“张敏才同志按照毛主席的教导，表现了真正的国际主义精神。”“我们坦桑尼亚人民将永远铭记着他。”
