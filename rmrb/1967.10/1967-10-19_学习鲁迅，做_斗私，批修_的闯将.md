Today marks the 31st anniversary of the death of the great communist warrior Lu Xun.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, and Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "criticize the self and oppose revisionism." At this time, it is particularly significant for us to commemorate Lu Xun.

Marx and Engels said, "A proletarian revolutionary, in his revolutionary activity, while changing his environment, also changes himself." Lu Xun is such a shining example. His struggle against the old world was so resolute, his exposure so profound, and his criticism so thorough. At the same time, in the struggle, he mercilessly dissected himself, strictly demanded of himself, and constantly spurred himself on. It was precisely by upholding and carrying forward this thorough revolutionary spirit that Lu Xun, in the blazing fire of class struggle, became a great communist warrior.

Lu Xun consistently and unyieldingly fought resolutely against all kinds of enemies. He not only stood up with a "fierce brow and cold eye," with tenacious willpower, to fight against the open enemies—imperialism and feudal forces; at the same time, he used his sharp and incisive pen to wage merciless struggles against those revisionist elements who donned the cloak of "revolution." Lu Xun deeply detested those counter-revolutionary two-faced elements who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and shot arrows from behind. He repeatedly warned people: "One must not only beware of enemies in front but also guard against spies on one's own side who change sides repeatedly." He recognized the danger of these hidden enemies and waged uncompromising struggles against them. He exposed the ugly faces of the Zhou Yang clique, who pretended to be human in front but played tricks behind the scenes, and depicted their counter-revolutionary ferocity of "using a big flag as a tiger's skin to wrap themselves and scare others." He seized their evil hands of spreading rumors, intimidating, creating factions, setting traps, and shooting arrows from behind. In his struggle against this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, Lu Xun defended the cause of the proletarian revolution and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art.

More than thirty years have passed, but the struggles Lu Xun waged still have profound enlightenment for us. The revisionist clique led by the Chinese Khrushchev is the most cunning, most treacherous, and most vicious counter-revolutionary two-faced element. They have perfected all the tricks of counter-revolutionary two-faced elements and formed a set of strategies and methods for conducting counter-revolutionary activities under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Today, as we commemorate Lu Xun, we must learn from his clear class stance of love and hate, his keen revolutionary insight, and his courage and wisdom in daring to struggle and being good at struggling, so as to wage a head-on struggle against this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. We must understand their counter-revolutionary strategies when they are in power and in a favorable position, grasp their operational laws of defending while attacking when they are in an unfavorable position, and also be able to guard against various ambitious plotters infiltrating the leadership organs of the proletariat, playing one trick in the open and another in secret, and shaking the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao from the right or the "ultra-left." In this way, we can prevent bad elements from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at all levels and ensure that our proletarian state will never change color.

Lu Xun was a brave warrior who charged into the old world, and he was also a model of self-conscious self-transformation. He said: "I indeed often dissect others, but more often and more mercilessly, I dissect myself." What a rare and precious spirit of self-conscious revolution! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the depths of people's souls. In this profound revolution, we must take Lu Xun as our example, deeply touch our own souls, and fiercely struggle against the "self" in our minds. We must not become the kind of person Lu Xun mocked, who "has many old residues in his mind but deliberately hides them, and points to his own nose, saying, 'I am the proletariat!'"

The "old residues" Lu Xun mentioned here are the traditional ideas of the exploiting classes, which are centered around the "self." The influence of this "self" has been deeply rooted for thousands of years. The Chinese Khrushchev has given this "self" many alluring disguises, such as the "fusion of public and private interests," "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," and "developing oneself while working for the Party." All these are fallacies, spiritual opium that poisons people, and must be thoroughly criticized and resolutely swept away.

Lu Xun deeply felt from the changes in his own camp that one must constantly transform oneself to keep up with the times; otherwise, even if one was originally a good runner pulling the cart forward, one might become a pitiful creature pulling the cart backward. He sincerely warned the people in the revolutionary ranks to beware of the "left" turning into the right, for example, the members of the Language and Literature Society, who "previously indeed fought against darkness, but once they gained a position, they themselves became darkness, saying nothing, using small tricks to guard their rice bowls." Currently, the proletarian revolutionary factions that have emerged from the Cultural Revolution have already changed their status, and many comrades have become responsible cadres. Is Lu Xun's warning not worth our deep reflection?

Lu Xun's criticism of the old world was so powerful, and his break with old traditional ideas was so thorough, mainly because he studied the works of Marxism-Leninism diligently in the struggle. He pursued truth with unparalleled devotion, comparing the translation of Marxist-Leninist works to "stealing fire from another country to cook one's own meat," and hoping that "someone who can use Marxist criticism like a gun will come to shoot at me." He solemnly declared to the counter-revolutionary revisionists who tried to make him abandon his Marxist-Leninist faith: "If I can survive, I will certainly continue to learn."

Under the great call of Chairman Mao, a new high tide of "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism" has swept across the country. As we commemorate Lu Xun and learn from Lu Xun, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism" as the guiding principle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

### 学习鲁迅，做“斗私，批修”的闯将

　　学习鲁迅，做“斗私，批修”的闯将
　　闻赞先
    今天，是伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅逝世三十一周年。
    当前无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，毛主席发出了“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，在这个时候我们来纪念鲁迅，有着特别重要的意义。
    马克思、恩格斯说，一个无产阶级革命家，他“在革命活动中，在改造环境的同时也改变着自己。”鲁迅就是这样的光辉榜样。他对旧世界的斗争是那样的坚决，揭露是那样的深刻，批判是那样的彻底。与此同时，在斗争中他又无情地解剖自己，严格地要求自己，不断地鞭策自己。正是坚持和发扬了这种彻底的革命精神，鲁迅在阶级斗争的熊熊烈火中，成了伟大的共产主义战士。
    鲁迅一贯不屈不挠地与各种敌人作坚决的斗争。他不仅以“横眉冷对”的英勇姿态，韧性战斗的顽强意志，同公开的敌人——帝国主义和封建势力进行搏斗；同时，他又用他那支泼辣、犀利的笔，同那些披着“革命”外衣的修正主义分子展开了无情的斗争。鲁迅对那些混入革命队伍、从背后放射暗箭的反革命两面派是深恶痛绝的。他反复地告诫人们：“不但应该留心迎面的敌人，还必须防备自己一面的三翻四复的暗探”。他认清了这些暗藏的敌人的危险性，就同他们进行毫不妥协的斗争。他揭露了周扬一伙当面装人，背后捣鬼的丑恶嘴脸，刻画了他们“拉大旗作为虎皮，包着自己，去吓呼别人”的反革命凶相，揪住了他们造谣恫吓，大搞宗派，设圈套，放暗箭的罪恶黑手。鲁迅在同这伙反革命修正主义分子的斗争中，保卫了无产阶级革命事业，保卫了毛主席的革命文艺路线。
    三十多年过去了，鲁迅所作的这些斗争，对我们仍然有着深刻的启发。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，是最狡猾、最阴险、最毒辣的反革命两面派。他们集一切反革命两面派之权术的大成，形成了一套在无产阶级专政条件下从事反革命活动的策略和方法。今天，我们纪念鲁迅，就是要学习他爱憎分明的阶级立场，明察秋毫的革命洞察力，敢于斗争、善于斗争的革命胆识，以便同这伙反革命修正主义分子展开针锋相对的斗争。我们既要懂得他们掌权得势时进攻的反革命策略，掌握他们处于不利情况下以守为攻的活动规律，也要能防备各种野心家阴谋家钻进无产阶级领导机构内部来，阴一套、阳一套，从右的或极“左”的方面来动摇以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。这样，我们就能防止坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导，使我们无产阶级的江山永不变色。
    鲁迅是向旧世界冲锋陷阵的勇士，又是自觉地进行自我改造的模范。他说：“我的确时时解剖别人，然而更多的是更无情面地解剖我自己。”这是多么难能可贵的自觉革命精神呵！无产阶级文化大革命是一场触及人们灵魂深处的大革命，在这场深刻的革命中，我们一定要以鲁迅为榜样，狠触自己的灵魂，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，决不要做鲁迅所嘲笑的那种人，他们“脑子里存在着许多旧的残滓，却故意瞒了起来，演戏似的指着自己的鼻子道：‘唯我是无产阶级！’”
    鲁迅这里说的“旧的残滓”，就是剥削阶级的传统观念，它是以“私”字为核心的。这个“私”字的影响，几千年来可谓根深蒂固。中国赫鲁晓夫给这个“私”字披上了许多迷人的外衣，什么“公私溶合论”啦，“吃小亏占大便宜”啦，“在为党工作中发展自己”啦，所有这些，统统是谬论，是毒害人的精神鸦片，必须彻底批判，坚决扫荡。
    鲁迅从自己阵营的离合变化中深深感到：必须不断改造自己，才能跟上时代的步伐；否则，即使原先是“拉车前进”的好身手，也可能变为“拉车屁股向后”的可怜虫。他诚恳地告诫革命队伍中的人，要谨防“左翼”变为右翼，例如语丝派的人，“先前确曾和黑暗战斗，但他们一有地位，本身又便变成黑暗了，一声不响，专用小玩艺，来抖抖的把守饭碗。”目前，从文化大革命中杀出来的无产阶级革命派，地位已经起了变化，不少同志成了负责人，鲁迅的这段话，难道不值得我们深思吗？
    鲁迅对旧世界的批判是那样的有力，与旧的传统观念决裂是那样的彻底，主要的原因，是他在斗争中刻苦地学习马克思列宁主义著作。他无限虔诚地追求真理，把翻译马克思列宁主义著作比为“从别国里窃得火来”“煮自己的肉”，并且期待着“有一个能操马克思主义批评的枪法的人来狙击”自己。他对企图使他放弃马克思列宁主义信仰的反革命修正主义分子庄严宣告：“倘能生存，我当然仍要学习。”
    在毛主席的伟大号召下，目前全国已掀起了“斗私，批修”的新高潮。我们纪念鲁迅，学习鲁迅，就要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
