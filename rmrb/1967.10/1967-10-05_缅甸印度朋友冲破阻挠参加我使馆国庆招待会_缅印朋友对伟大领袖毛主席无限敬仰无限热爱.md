The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar held a grand reception on October 1 to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Over 1,600 friends from various circles in Myanmar, diplomats from many countries stationed in Myanmar, and representatives of patriotic overseas Chinese attended the reception.

The reactionary government of Myanmar has intensified its anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, dispatching a large number of agents to closely monitor the national day activities held by the Chinese Embassy. However, the people of Myanmar have shown the warmest feelings towards the Chinese people. At the reception, Myanmar friends expressed their boundless admiration and love for the great leader Chairman Mao. One Myanmar friend said, "No one can destroy the traditional and profound friendship between the peoples of Myanmar and China." Myanmar friends also sent letters of congratulation and flower baskets to the Chinese Embassy to express their greetings to the Chinese people.

At the reception, patriotic overseas Chinese enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They strongly condemned the anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities of the reactionary government of Myanmar. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao and sang songs such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

The Chinese Embassy in India overcame numerous obstacles set by the reactionary government of India and held a reception on October 1 in New Delhi to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

People from various circles in India and diplomats from other countries stationed in India attended the reception held by the Chinese Embassy. Diplomatic personnel from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other countries sent letters of congratulation, flower baskets, and bouquets to the Chinese Embassy to celebrate the great festival of the Chinese people.

The reactionary government of India, which is madly anti-China, used despicable means to obstruct Indian friends from attending the reception and attempted to sabotage the celebratory activities of the Chinese Embassy. Hundreds of reactionary Indian police and agents surrounded and blockaded the Chinese Embassy. They set up three lines of defense to prevent Indian friends from entering the Chinese Embassy and even brutally beat Indian friends who attended the reception held by the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese Embassy strongly condemned the atrocities of the reactionary Indian police and agents and lodged a protest with the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Many Indian friends, despite the obstruction and persecution by the reactionary police and agents, resolutely attended the reception. A trade union official said, "China's National Day is also a festival for the Indian people. Chairman Mao is the leader of the world's revolutionary people. The Indian people have a way out only by learning Mao Zedong Thought and following the path of China."

Indian friends enthusiastically requested copies of Chairman Mao's works.

    缅甸印度朋友冲破阻挠参加我使馆国庆招待会
    缅印朋友对伟大领袖毛主席无限敬仰无限热爱
    新华社四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆一日举行盛大招待会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。缅甸各界朋友、许多国家驻缅甸的外交使节和爱国华侨代表等一千六百多人出席了招待会。
    缅甸反动政府加紧反华排华，派出大批特务对中国大使馆举行的国庆活动严加监视，但是，缅甸人民对中国人民表示了最友好的感情。在招待会上，缅甸朋友对伟大领袖毛主席表示无限敬仰和爱戴。一位缅甸朋友说：“任何人也休想破坏缅中两国人民之间传统的、深厚的友谊。”缅甸朋友还写贺信和寄花篮给中国大使馆，对中国人民表示祝贺。
    在招待会上，爱国华侨热情赞扬伟大的领袖毛主席和由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，强烈谴责缅甸反动政府的反华排华暴行。他们不断高呼：“敬祝我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们齐声朗读毛主席语录，高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲。
    新华社四日讯　新德里消息：中国驻印度大使馆排除印度反动政府的重重障碍，一日在新德里举行招待会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    印度各界人士和外国驻印度的使节等出席了中国大使馆的招待会。越南民主共和国等国的外交人员向中国大使馆送贺信、花篮和花束，祝贺中国人民的伟大节日。
    正在疯狂反华的印度反动政府采取卑鄙的手段，阻挠印度朋友参加招待会，阴谋破坏中国大使馆的庆祝活动。印度反动警察、特务二百多人包围封锁中国大使馆。他们布设了三道防线，阻拦印度朋友进入中国大使馆，甚至野蛮殴打参加中国大使馆招待会的印度朋友。中国大使馆严正谴责了印度反动警察、特务的暴行，并向印度外交部提出抗议。不少印度朋友不顾反动警察、特务的阻拦和迫害，坚决地参加了招待会。一位工会干部说，中国的国庆也是印度人民的节日。毛主席是世界革命人民的领袖。印度人民只有学习毛泽东思想，走中国的道路，才有出路。
    印度朋友热情地索取了毛主席著作。
