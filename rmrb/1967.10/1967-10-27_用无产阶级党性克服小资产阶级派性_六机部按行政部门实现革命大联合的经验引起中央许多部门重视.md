The revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry, with the help of the PLA stationed in the ministry, have taken "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the guiding principle, firmly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and used proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. They rapidly achieved revolutionary great unity based on administrative departments. This experience has attracted the attention of many central departments. In recent days, many central departments have sent people to visit and learn from them, and some have even invited them to give reports and share their experiences.

The revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry announced the achievement of revolutionary great unity based on administrative departments on September 21. By October 7, all bureaus, offices, departments, sections, and units had established unified revolutionary mass organizations. The Revolutionary Masses' Great Unity Committee of the ministry, after full consultation, was also established. Now, the entire Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry presents a scene of unity and struggle. Under the leadership of various levels of service teams, a high tide of seriously studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions has been launched. They are determined to respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" and to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage.

Originally, the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry had twelve mass organizations, divided into two factions. The general direction of these organizations was basically the same, but due to differing views on individual persons in power and the influence of petty-bourgeois factionalism, there was a lot of opposition. This time, they were able to rapidly achieve revolutionary great unity based on departments in less than twenty days. The main reason was that the broad revolutionary masses listened to Chairman Mao's words and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, using proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. Thus, they overcame one difficulty after another and paved the way for the full achievement of great unity based on departments. The PLA comrades who helped the ministry also played an active role in promoting the revolutionary unity of the ministry.

	Leveling the Mountains, Resolutely Achieving Great Unity Based on Departments

In the process of achieving revolutionary great unity, the first problem encountered by the revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry was the form of unity. In mid-September, after Chairman Mao's great call for revolutionary great unity was issued, the revolutionary masses of the ministry responded enthusiastically, firmly supporting it and immediately launching a wave of great unity. However, how to unite? At that time, there were two opinions: one believed that revolutionary great unity based on administrative departments should be achieved immediately, while the other believed that unity based on organizations should be achieved first, and then transitioned to unity based on departments. The former opinion was mainly that of the majority faction. They proposed this form of unity, which was in line with the spirit of the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill affirmed by Chairman Mao, but it also had some private interests, thinking that after all, they were the majority, and unity based on departments would not be a disadvantage. The latter opinion still had some attachment to their own "mountains," and some feared that after unity based on departments, their numbers would be small and they would be "eaten" by the majority faction. In response to this situation, the PLA comrades conducted a timely study and believed that achieving revolutionary great unity based on departments was the only correct direction for revolutionary great unity and was in line with the wishes of the broad masses. The two factions of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry were both revolutionary mass organizations and fully possessed the conditions for achieving great unity based on departments. Based on the above analysis, several responsible comrades of the PLA stationed in the ministry clearly stated their opinions at the ministry's revolutionary great unity oath-taking rally on September 21, supporting the achievement of revolutionary great unity based on departments. They also spoke at length about the advantages of great unity based on departments, targeting the active thoughts of the two factions. The speeches of the PLA comrades received strong support and approval from the broad masses. Many representatives of mass organizations immediately expressed their willingness to dissolve their original combat organizations and return to their units to participate in great unity based on departments. Some who originally insisted on unity based on organizations also gave up their views and agreed to the opinion of achieving revolutionary great unity based on departments.

	Breaking Private Interests and Establishing Public Interests, Correctly Handling the Issue of "Power"

After determining the great unity based on departments, the next issue was how to form the leading bodies of various levels of revolutionary mass organizations. The two sides had fierce arguments, with some wanting to be the main force in the leading body, some wanting to be the first-in-command, some arguing over quotas and seats, and some arguing over the methods of producing service personnel. Although these arguments had their own reasons, the core issue was the issue of "power."

In response to this situation, the PLA comrades followed Chairman Mao's great teachings and conducted in-depth and detailed ideological work among the two factions, especially among the leaders of the two factions, organizing them to study Chairman Mao's relevant works, inspiring them to break private interests and establish public interests, overcome factionalism, and correctly handle the issue of "power." After repeated education, the vast majority of revolutionary masses and leaders of mass organizations were able to realize that proletarian revolutionary factions could only fight for power for their class and for the revolution, and could not fight for power for personal interests or for the interests of small groups. Proletarian revolutionary factions seized power to better implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and act according to Mao Zedong Thought. If they deviated from Mao Zedong Thought, they would fall into the quagmire of revisionism and would not gain the support of the broad revolutionary masses. Everyone, based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously broke private interests and established public interests, and finally smoothly solved this problem. In many units, when forming the service teams, a unprecedented good atmosphere of mutual recommendation, mutual trust, and mutual respect emerged. In some units, although one faction was numerically dominant, they were still able to achieve equality and consultation under the help of the PLA, and quickly selected a service team that satisfied both sides. Many comrades deeply felt: "It seems that we have conceded some steps in the issues of seats and quotas, but in fact, we have advanced several steps. Because this way, we have won the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and achieved revolutionary great unity."

In addition to the issues of organizational forms and the selection of leading bodies, the revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry also encountered other differing opinions in the process of achieving revolutionary great unity. For example, in the issue of the steps to establish various levels of united organizational structures, some advocated selecting representatives from the current service personnel of the two factions to quickly start the work, while others believed that it should be produced from the bottom up in a step-by-step manner; in the issue of how to deal with the dissolution of organizations, some advocated that the dissolution should be announced first, and then return to the department for unity, while others advocated returning to participate in the department's unity first, and then announcing the withdrawal and dissolution of the organization; and so on. In handling these issues, the PLA comrades always relied on the masses, believed in the masses, and educated the masses to prioritize the overall situation and revolutionary interests, and not to argue endlessly over trivial issues. Therefore, they quickly reached a consensus.

	Strengthening Ideological Education, Consolidating and Developing Revolutionary Great Unity

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "One cannot assume that a new system, once established, is completely consolidated. That is impossible." "After it is consolidated, if one relaxes, it may collapse again." Based on this teaching, after achieving great unity based on departments, the revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry promptly carried out work to consolidate and develop great unity from an ideological perspective. Their main practices are:

First, they organized the broad revolutionary masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China. Using the method of self-education by the masses, they guided everyone to deeply understand the spirit and essence of Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly analyze the situation, and solve various ideological problems that arose after great unity. After studying, many comrades checked and criticized their own incorrect thoughts in great unity and conducted self-criticism, deepened mutual understanding, narrowed the ideological gap, and further enhanced unity.

Second, with "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the guiding principle and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the weapon, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and conducted collective training for the newly selected service personnel. Through the training, the awareness of the service personnel was raised to varying degrees. They fiercely criticized and exposed their private thoughts and factional activities in great unity, and on the basis of self-criticism, carried out mutual criticism. Many study sessions turned into heart-to-heart talks, and thus the relationship between the two sides became more harmonious. They said that in the past, negotiating with factionalism was like running back-to-back races, the further they ran, the further apart they became; now, studying Chairman Mao's works together was like running face-to-face races, the further they ran, the closer they became. Some said that the study class was truly a battlefield for fighting self and criticizing revisionism and a classroom for mutual help and learning. They expressed their determination to bring the results of their studies back and further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity.

Third, the PLA comrades went deep among the masses and conducted detailed ideological work. For those with more ideological problems, they adopted methods such as joint study of Chairman Mao's works and heart-to-heart talks to raise their awareness, and achieved remarkable results.

    用无产阶级党性克服小资产阶级派性
    六机部按行政部门实现革命大联合的经验引起中央许多部门重视
    据新华社二十四日讯　第六机械工业部的无产阶级革命派在驻部解放军同志的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大树毛泽东思想绝对权威，用无产阶级的党性克服小资产阶级的派性，迅速实现了按行政部门的革命大联合。这一经验，引起了中央许多部门的重视。最近几天，中央不少部门纷纷派人前往访问学习，有的还请他们去作报告介绍经验。
    六机部的无产阶级革命派，是在九月二十一日宣布按行政部门实现革命大联合的。到十月七日，全部所有厅、局、部处、室统统建立了统一的革命群众组织，部机关的无产阶级革命派大联合委员会，经过充分协商以后，也已建立起来。现在，整个六机部呈现出一派团结战斗的气象。广大革命群众正在各级勤务组的领导下，掀起了认真学习和贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示的高潮，决心响应伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的阶段。
    六机部原来有十二个群众组织，分两大派。这些组织的大方向基本上是一致的，但是由于对个别当权派看法有分歧，加上小资产阶级派性作怪，过去对立情绪比较严重。这次他们能在不到二十天内迅速实现按部门的革命大联合，最主要的原因，是由于广大革命群众听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，用无产阶级的党性克服小资产阶级的派性，因而战胜了一个又一个困难，为全面实现按部门大联合铺平了道路。在六机部帮助工作的解放军同志，对于这个部的革命大联合，也起了积极的促进作用。
      削平山头，坚决实现按部门的革命大联合
    六机部无产阶级革命派在进行革命大联合的过程中，遇到的第一个问题，就是按照什么形式进行联合。九月中旬，毛主席关于实现革命大联合伟大号召发出后，六机部的革命群众热烈响应，坚决拥护，立刻掀起大联合的热潮。但是怎样联合？当时有两种意见，一种认为应该立刻按照行政部门实现革命的大联合，另一种则认为应该先按组织联合，然后再过渡到按部门联合。前一种意见，主要是多数派的意见。他们提出的这种联合形式是符合毛主席肯定的贵阳棉纺厂经验的精神的，但是多少也有一些私心，觉得反正自己是多数，按部门联合不吃亏。后一种意见，则还有些留恋自己的山头，有少数人怕按部门联合后自己人数少，会被多数派“吃掉”。针对这个情况，解放军同志及时进行了研究，认为按部门实现革命大联合是革命大联合的唯一正确的方向，是符合广大群众的愿望的，六机部两派都是革命群众组织，完全具备按部门大联合的条件。驻部解放军的几位负责同志根据上述分析，就在九月二十一日部机关的革命大联合誓师大会上明确表示了自己的意见，赞成按部门实现革命大联合，并且针对两派组织的活思想，大讲特讲按部门大联合的好处。解放军同志的讲话，得到广大群众的热烈支持和拥护。不少群众组织代表当场就表示要解散原来的战斗组织，回本单位参加按部门的大联合，一些原来坚持按组织联合的同志，也放弃了自己的主张，同意了按部门实现革命大联合的意见。 	 破私立公，正确对待“权”字
    在确定按部门大联合后，接着又发生了怎样产生各级革命群众组织领导班子的问题。双方争执十分激烈，有的想在领导班子中“以我为主”，有的争当第一把手，有的争名额、争席位，也有的争勤务员产生的方法。这些争论虽然各有各的道理，但是核心问题是个“权”字。
    针对这一情况，解放军同志遵循毛主席的伟大教导，对两派群众，特别是对两派头头进行了深入细致的思想工作，组织他们学习毛主席有关著作，启发他们破私立公，克服派性，正确对待“权”字。经过这样反复教育以后，绝大多数革命群众和群众组织负责人都能认识到无产阶级革命派只能为自己的阶级争权，为革命争权，绝不能为个人争权，为小团体利益争权。无产阶级革命派掌了权，目的是更好地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，按照毛泽东思想办事，如果离开了毛泽东思想，就会陷入修正主义泥坑，也绝不会得到广大革命群众的拥护。大家在毛泽东思想的原则基础上认真破私立公，终于顺利地解决了这个问题，不少单位在产生勤务班子时，出现了互推互让，互相信任，互相尊重的空前良好的团结气氛。有的单位一派在人数上虽占压倒多数，但也在解放军的帮助下，能够根据实际情况，做到平等协商，很快就选出了使双方都能满意的勤务班子。很多同志深有体会地说：“看起来，我们在席位、名额等问题上好象让了些步，实际上是前进了好几步。因为这样做，换来了毛泽东思想的胜利，实现了革命的大联合。”
    除了组织形式和推选领导班子问题外，六机部无产阶级革命派在实现革命大联合的过程中，还出现了其他一些不同的意见。例如，在建立各级联合组织机构的步骤问题上，有的主张先从两派现有勤务员中选派代表，以便把工作尽快抓起来，有的主张应该自下而上地逐级产生；在怎样对待解散组织问题上，有的主张必须先宣布解散，然后再回部门归口联合，有的主张先回去参加本部门的联合，再宣布退出解散组织；等等。解放军同志在处理这些问题时，都是充分依靠群众，相信群众，教育群众以大局为重，以革命利益为重，不要在枝节问题上争论不休，因而也就很快取得了一致的意见。
      加强思想教育，巩固和发展革命的大联合
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“不能认为新制度一旦建立起来就完全巩固了，那是不可能的。”“巩固了以后，只要一松劲，又可能垮台。”根据这个教导，六机部无产阶级革命派在实现按部门大联合后，又及时抓了从思想上巩固和发展大联合的工作。他们的主要做法是：
    第一，组织广大革命群众认真学习毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的最新指示。用群众自己教育自己的方法，引导大家深刻领会毛主席指示的精神实质，正确分析形势，解决大联合后出现的各种思想问题。许多同志在学习以后，对照检查了自己在大联合中的各种不正确的思想，并且进行了自我批评，加深了相互了解，缩小了思想上的距离，进一步增强了团结。
    第二，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，开办毛泽东思想学习班，对新选出来的勤务员进行集训。通过集训，勤务员的觉悟都有不同程度的提高，他们狠亮狠批自己在大联合中的私心杂念和派性活动，在自我批评的基础上，开展了相互批评。许多学习会变成了谈心会，因而双方的关系也就更加融洽。他们说，过去带着派性去谈判，就好比背靠背赛跑，愈跑愈远；现在联合在一起学习毛主席著作，好比面对面赛跑，愈跑愈近。有的说，学习班真是斗私批修的战场，互帮互学的课堂。他们表示一定要把学习成果带回去，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合。
    第三，解放军同志深入群众，进行细致的思想工作。对思想问题较多的人，他们采取共同学习毛主席著作，促膝谈心等办法，提高他们的认识，也收到了显著效果。
