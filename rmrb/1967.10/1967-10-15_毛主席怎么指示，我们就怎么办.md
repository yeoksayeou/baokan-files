	Vibrant news has spread from the mountains of Jinggang and the banks of the Gan River: six prefectures and over 90% of the counties and cities in Jiangxi Province have achieved revolutionary unity.

	Forty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao established China's first red base on this very land in Jiangxi, sowing the seeds of revolution. Over the past forty years, the great thought of Mao Zedong has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of Jiangxi. Recently, Chairman Mao personally inspected the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province. The red sun has illuminated the revolutionary old base area of Jiangxi, lighting up the hearts of its 22 million people.

	“Whatever Chairman Mao instructs, we will do!” This is the glorious tradition passed down by the people of the revolutionary old base area of Jiangxi. Under the great banner of “Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism,” the people of Jiangxi Province have, in a short period, created a new situation of revolutionary unity.

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after several rounds of struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province have come to a clearer understanding: to overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to complete the great historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must unite and combine forces.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “All reactionaries are paper tigers.” The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are also paper tigers.

	The great revolutionary situation in Jiangxi tells us: although the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party may be rampant for a time, in the face of the awakened people, all their tricks and schemes will ultimately be thoroughly exposed and defeated.

	The great revolutionary situation in Jiangxi tells us: “Chaos” and “order” are contradictory and united. With Chairman Mao’s great prestige and the great iron wall of the People’s Liberation Army of China, we dare to use a seemingly chaotic form to expose all the ghosts and monsters and squeeze out all the poison. Chaos is chaos for the enemy, tempering the masses. Under the command of our great leader, the broad revolutionary masses unite in will and step, creating a vibrant new socialist order.

	Currently, the revolutionary situation across the country is better than ever. However, our tasks remain extremely arduous. We must hold high the great banner of “Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism,” further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the revolutionary “three-in-one combination.” We must unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform within our units, and launch a new high tide of revolutionizing and promoting production.

	We wish the people of Jiangxi Province to continue their efforts, remain humble and steady, and hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Let the revolutionary flame ignited by Chairman Mao on Jinggang Mountain burn even brighter and more fiercely.

　　毛主席怎么指示，我们就怎么办
　　本报评论员
    井冈山上下，赣江两岸，传来了振奋人心的喜讯，江西省六个专区和百分之九十以上的县市实现了革命大联合。
    四十年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席，就在江西这块土地上，创建了中国第一个红色根据地，撒下了革命的种子。四十年来，伟大的毛泽东思想，在江西广大人民心中深深地扎下了根。最近，毛主席又亲自视察了江西省的无产阶级文化大革命。红太阳照亮了江西革命老根据地，照亮了江西两千二百万人民的心坎。
    “毛主席怎么指示，我们就怎么办！”这是江西革命老根据地人民长期继承下来的光荣传统。江西省人民在“斗私，批修”的伟大纲领指引下，在短短的时间里，就创造了革命大联合的崭新局面。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，经过同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的几番较量，几番搏斗，江西省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，更清楚地认识到，要打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，要完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务，就应该团结起来，联合起来。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派同样是纸老虎。
    江西省大好的革命形势告诉我们：党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派尽管猖獗一时，但是，在觉醒的人民面前，他们的一切阴谋诡计终将遭到彻底的破产。
    江西省大好革命形势告诉我们：“乱”和“治”是对立的统一。有毛主席的崇高威望，有中国人民解放军这个伟大的钢铁长城，我们就敢于通过一种表面上很“乱”的形式，把一切牛鬼蛇神通通暴露出来，把毒脓通通挤掉。乱，那是乱了敌人，锻炼了群众。广大革命群众在我们伟大统帅的指挥下，统一意志，统一步调，创造生气勃勃的社会主义新秩序。
    目前，全国革命形势空前大好。但是，我们的任务仍然是十分艰巨的。我们要高举“斗私，批修”的伟大旗帜，进一步巩固和发展革命大联合和革命的“三结合”。要团结一切可以团结的革命力量，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，掀起本单位斗批改的新高潮，掀起抓革命，促生产的新高潮。
    愿江西省人民，再接再厉，戒骄戒躁，把毛泽东思想红旗举得高高的，让毛主席亲自点燃的井冈山革命烈火，烧得更红更旺。
