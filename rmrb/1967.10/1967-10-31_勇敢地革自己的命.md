The experience of Qingdao's Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory proves that to achieve, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary great alliance, the key lies in using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely combat the "self" within one's own mind.

Only by combating the "self" can one correctly distinguish and handle two types of different contradictions, and can one tell the difference between a "Yan'an" problem and a "Xi'an" problem.

Only by combating the "self" can one avoid being blinded by sectarianism, cliquism, and other petty-bourgeois factionalism, using methods meant for enemies against one's own comrades, and doing stupid things that hurt friends and please enemies. By removing selfishness, there is a common foundation for achieving revolutionary great alliances. By removing selfishness, one will not be eager to fight "internal wars," and can direct the spearhead against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Only by combating the "self" can one correctly resolve contradictions among revolutionary mass organizations. One must follow the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," do more self-criticism, and not always blame others. One should not expose others' weaknesses.

Combating the "self" is a conscious revolutionary action of the proletarian revolutionaries. The proletarian revolutionaries of Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, not only regard themselves as a force of the revolution but also continuously regard themselves as the object of the revolution. They said well: "To continue the revolution, one must take up the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, use Mao Zedong Thought as the standard, and boldly revolutionize oneself." On the basis of self-revolution, they actively check on each other, take responsibility, gain each other's understanding and trust, thereby continuously consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance.

All proletarian revolutionaries across the country should learn from the proletarian revolutionaries of Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, take "combating the self and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, achieve, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    勇敢地革自己的命
    本报评论员
    青岛市四方机车车辆工厂的经验证明，要实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合，关键在于以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字。
    只有斗私，才能正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，才能分清是“延安”问题还是“西安”问题。
    只有斗私，才不至于被山头主义、小团体主义等小资产阶级派性蒙住自己的眼睛，用对待敌人的方法对待自己的战友，做出使亲者痛、仇者快的蠢事。去掉了私心，实现革命大联合就有了共同的基础。去掉了私心，才不会热中于打“内战”，才能把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    只有斗私，才能正确解决革命群众组织之间的矛盾。一定要按照
  “团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式去做，多做自我批评，不要老是责怪对方，不要去揭人家的疮疤。
    斗私，是无产阶级革命派自觉的革命行动。四方机车车辆工厂的无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军的帮助下，按照林彪副主席的指示，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又不断地把自己当作革命的对象。他们说得好：“要继续干革命，必须拿起批评和自我批评的武器，以毛泽东思想为标准，勇敢地革自己的命。”他们在自我革命的基础上，彼此主动检查，承担责任，取得了对方的谅解和信任，从而使革命大联合不断巩固，不断发展。
    全国无产阶级革命派，都要向四方机车车辆工厂无产阶级革命派学习，以“斗私，批修”为纲，实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
