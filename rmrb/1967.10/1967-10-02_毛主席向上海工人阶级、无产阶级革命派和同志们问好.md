Comrade Zhang Chunqiao conveyed the warm instructions and boundless care of the great leader at the Shanghai celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

Chairman Mao sends greetings to the working class of Shanghai, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and comrades.

The 500,000 military and civilian participants in the rally and parade vowed to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the "criticize revisionism and repudiate selfishness" policy, to further deepen the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation within their units. At the same time, during the revolutionary criticism, they will continue to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, to achieve new and even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1st—In the unprecedentedly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, the revolutionary masses of the birthplace of the "January Revolution" storm, Shanghai, with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, with unparalleled fighting enthusiasm, enthusiastically celebrated the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, enthusiastically hailed the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and enthusiastically celebrated the decisive and brilliant victories achieved in the past year under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, 500,000 warriors of the proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanghai, soldiers of the three services stationed in Shanghai, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses held a grand celebration rally at the city center's People's Square. After the rally, a majestic national day parade was held. Today's rally and parade fully demonstrated the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai; it showed that the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai are determined to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the "criticize revisionism and repudiate selfishness" policy, to further deepen the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation within their units. At the same time, during the revolutionary criticism, they will continue to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, to achieve new and even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This year's National Day came at a time when the great leader Chairman Mao had personally inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions, and a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination had been launched nationwide. This year's National Day is the first National Day after the proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanghai seized power from the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road. On this glorious day, recalling the arduous journey and great victories of the past year, how could people not shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" a thousand times and ten thousand times?

Early this morning, the workers, peasants, and soldiers who were in high spirits celebrating the festival, the revolutionary Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary scientific and technological workers, and the soldiers of the three services of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, came from all directions to the city center's People's Square. They held high portraits of Chairman Mao, carried red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waved red flags, carried large banners, and sang revolutionary songs, forming a surging red tide. Before the rally began, people, with boundless excitement and emotion, greeted the sunrise, reading aloud the quotations of Chairman Mao over and over again, singing loudly the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao. The songs, gongs, drums, and slogans blended into one.

The celebration rally began at 9:00 AM. Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Comrades Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Liao Zhenguo attended the celebration rally. Other leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, leaders of the three services of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, and leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai also attended today's celebration rally.

Invited to attend the review were foreign experts and foreign students, trainees, and sailors from various countries in Shanghai port, as well as other foreign friends.

Comrade Liao Zhenguo presided over the celebration rally. At 9:00 AM sharp, the rally began, and the entire audience stood up. The orchestra played "The East Is Red" and the national anthem, and 28 cannon shots were fired.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao gave an important speech amidst warm applause. He first conveyed the great leader Chairman Mao's boundless concern for the workers and peasants of Shanghai, for the soldiers of the three services, for the Red Guards, for all revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and people of all nationalities. He said that not long ago, Chairman Mao personally visited Shanghai, inspected the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, and gave extremely important instructions. This is the greatest encouragement, greatest concern, and greatest support for the people of Shanghai, and it is also the greatest glory for the people of Shanghai. Chairman Mao instructed us to greet the working class and the broad proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanghai! To greet the comrades of Shanghai!

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao said: Over the past year and more, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, we in Shanghai, like in other parts of the country, have won great victories. The handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as the head, including Chen Piwen and Cao Qiaozhou in Shanghai, have been pulled down from their horses by the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses. The bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian dictatorship have been beaten to a pulp. Our proletarian dictatorship is stronger than ever, and our great motherland is stronger than ever!

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao said: The American imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries are watching with wide eyes, hoping to find something worth celebrating in Shanghai. Let these gentlemen take a look at the changes in Shanghai over the past year! On this day last year, Chen Piwen and Cao Qiaozhou were still strutting around, suppressing the revolution; our proletarian revolutionary masses' forces were then relatively small. Today, Chen and Cao have been surrounded by revolutionary people, and the proletarian revolutionary masses have basically achieved revolutionary great alliance, forming a vast revolutionary army. We have firmly grasped the fate of the proletarian dictatorship, the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fate of the socialist economy in our own hands. Domestic and foreign bourgeois gentlemen, you dream day and night of restoring capitalism in China, so let you see the fate of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai!

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao emphasized in his speech: We have achieved great victories. But we must not be complacent. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, is at the decisive stage. Our work still has many shortcomings. Our future is bright, but there will inevitably be twists and turns. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the fundamental guarantee of our victory. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the general direction of the revolutionary struggle. At present, we must further carry out revolutionary criticism, further consolidate the revolutionary great alliance, unite and educate the broad cadres and masses, further develop and consolidate the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, do well in the struggle-criticism-transformation within the units, and establish, strengthen, and consolidate the revolutionary committees at all levels. We must further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to achieve double victories in revolution and production. We must further carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement, strengthen military-civilian unity, and strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's recent instructions to "criticize revisionism and repudiate selfishness," to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and truly make Shanghai a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

After the celebration rally, a magnificent national day parade began! The majestic parade, amidst thunderous cheers, marched forward with heads held high and in an unyielding manner. The giant statue of Chairman Mao, shining with ten thousand rays of golden light, stood at the forefront of the parade. A band of over 500 people followed closely behind the giant statue of Chairman Mao, playing the song "The Ship of the Sea Depends on the Helmsman." Our most beloved Chairman Mao! We will sing your praises for a thousand generations, we will forever follow you, we will definitely follow the instructions of your closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, to forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, to be your good students and good soldiers!

Behind the band were the ranks of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, fully armed and armed to the teeth, participated in the rally and parade with great spirit. The three services stationed in Shanghai, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have made outstanding contributions in the struggle against imperialist aggression, in defending the socialist national defense, and in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have also responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses, with the greatest enthusiasm, rushing to the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and establishing immortal new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The parade also included a armed contingent of the Shanghai workers' revolutionary masses. This fully armed contingent composed of workers' revolutionary masses, with a solemn formation, held high the bright red flags and marched forward with heads held high, showing the determination of the Shanghai people to further strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of domestic and foreign class enemies, and firmly seize the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The ranks of the revolutionary little red guards and little red soldiers were even more vigorous and spirited, showing the great achievements of "military-political training." The revolutionary little guards pledged to the great commander Chairman Mao: they would definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to be reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. They vowed to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "resume classes and make revolution," to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, to charge into the front lines of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation, to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents politically, ideologically, and theoretically; they vowed to firmly seize the power of the "self" in their minds, to strive to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, to strengthen proletarian party spirit, and to temper themselves into selfless proletarian revolutionary warriors.

The Shanghai working class, which has established great merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, today, under the bright red flag of the "Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters," marched forward majestically. This revolutionary contingent, with over a million workers' revolutionary army, listens to Chairman Mao's words the most and follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step. It is they who, against the wind and waves, have repelled the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, smashed the counter-revolutionary economic wind; it is they who, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, issued the bold vow of "doing as Chairman Mao says"; it is they who, in the revolutionary criticism of the great encirclement and suppression of China's Khrushchev, have undoubtedly played the role of the main force; it is they who have immediately turned Chairman Mao's latest instructions into action, taking the lead, and launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination; it is they who have actively implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," under the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, making the production of many important products needed for national construction and people's lives continuously increase, the quality steadily improve, the consumption of raw materials continuously decrease, and successfully trial-produced and produced many important new products.

The parade also included revolutionary warriors of the proletariat from various fronts such as agriculture, finance and trade, education, science and technology, literature and art, medical and health, news, publishing, and sports. The broad community members of the suburbs of Shanghai, who have already achieved a great harvest in agriculture, also participated in today's parade. They vowed to achieve "six goods" in agriculture and to achieve an even greater harvest in agriculture this year. Shanghai revolutionary literary and art workers, under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong literary and art thought, and under the care of the heroic flag bearer of the cultural revolution, Comrade Jiang Qing, have successfully created and performed revolutionary model operas one after another; at the same time, they have formed thousands of literary and art squads to go deep into factories and villages, to serve the current political struggle.

    张春桥同志在上海庆祝建国十八周年大会上转达伟大领袖的亲切嘱咐和无限关怀
    毛主席向上海工人阶级、无产阶级革命派和同志们问好
    参加集会游行的五十万军民表示，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在“斗私，批修”方针的指引下，进一步深入开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，同时在革命大批判中，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的、更加伟大的胜利。
    据新华社上海一日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，“一月革命”风暴策源地上海的革命群众，怀着对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，以无比高昂的战斗激情，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年，热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，热烈欢呼一年来毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的决定性的辉煌胜利。
    今天，上海市无产阶级革命派战士、驻沪三军指战员、红卫兵小将和革命群众五十万人在市中心人民广场举行了盛大的庆祝集会。会后举行了威武雄壮的节日游行。今天的集会和游行，充分显示了上海市无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就；表现了上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在“斗私，批修”方针的指引下，进一步深入开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，同时在革命大批判中，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的、更加伟大的胜利。
    今年的国庆，是在伟大领袖毛主席亲自视察了华北、中南和华东地区，在全国范围内掀起了一个革命大批判、革命大联合、革命“三结合”的新高潮中来到的。今年的国庆，是上海无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权后的第一个国庆节日。在这个光辉的日子里，回顾一年艰苦历程和伟大胜利，人们怎么能不千遍万次地高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    今天一清早，满怀革命豪情欢度节日的工农兵群众，革命的红卫兵，革命师生，革命干部，革命的科学技术工作者，中国人民解放军驻沪三军指战员，就从四面八方来到了市中心的人民广场。他们高举毛主席画像，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，擎着红旗，抬着大幅标语，高唱革命歌曲汇成汹涌的红色巨流。大会开始前，人们怀着无比兴奋和激动的心情，迎着朝霞，一遍又一遍地齐声朗读毛主席语录，纵情高唱对伟大领袖毛主席的颂歌，歌声，锣鼓声，口号声响成一片。
    庆祝大会在上午九时开始。上海市革命委员会负责人张春桥同志、姚文元同志和廖政国同志出席了庆祝大会。上海市革命委员会其他领导成员，中国人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军负责人以及上海各革命群众组织负责人也出席了今天的庆祝大会。
    应邀参加观礼的还有在上海的外国专家和外国留学生、实习生，在上海港口的各国海员代表以及其他外国朋友。
    庆祝大会由廖政国同志主持。九时整，大会开始，全场起立，乐队高奏《东方红》和国歌，礼炮鸣二十八响。
    张春桥同志在热烈的掌声中作了重要讲话。他在讲话中首先带来了伟大领袖毛主席对上海工人、农民，对陆海空三军指战员，对红卫兵小将，对一切革命干部、革命知识分子和各族人民的无限关怀。他说，不久以前，毛主席亲临上海，视察了上海的无产阶级文化大革命，作了极其重要的指示。这是对上海人民最大鼓舞、最大关怀、最大支持，也是上海人民的最大光荣。毛主席嘱咐我们向上海的工人阶级和广大无产阶级革命派问好！向上海的同志们问好！
    张春桥同志说：一年多以来，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们上海同全国各地一样，打了很大很大的胜仗。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，包括在上海的陈丕显、曹荻秋之流，被无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众拉下了马，隐藏在无产阶级专政机构中的资产阶级司令部，已被打得落花流水。我们的无产阶级专政空前强大，我们伟大的祖国空前强大！
    张春桥同志说：美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、各国反动派，睁大了两只眼睛，妄想从上海能够找到一点值得他们高兴的事情。那就请这些老爷们看一看上海一年来的变化吧！去年今天，陈丕显、曹荻秋之流还能够耀武扬威，镇压革命；我们无产阶级革命派的队伍当时还比较小。今年今天，陈、曹之流已经陷在革命人民的包围之中，无产阶级革命派已经基本上实现了革命的大联合，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，我们已经把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，牢牢地掌握在自己手里。国内外资产阶级老爷们，你们日夜梦想在中国复辟资本主义，那就请你们看一看中国赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人的下场吧！
    张春桥同志在讲话中强调指出：我们已经取得了伟大的胜利。但是，我们决不可以骄傲起来。无产阶级同资产阶级之间、社会主义同资本主义两条道路之间、无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线之间的斗争，正处在决战阶段。我们的工作还有不少缺点。我们的前途是无限光明的，但是，不可避免地还会出现曲折和反复。我们永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于以毛主席为首的党中央无产阶级司令部，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这是我们胜利的根本保证。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握革命斗争的大方向。在当前，我们要进一步开展革命的大批判，进一步巩固革命的大联合，团结和教育广大的干部和群众，进一步发展和巩固革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，建立、健全和巩固各级革命委员会。我们要进一步贯彻执行毛主席制定的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，夺取革命、生产的双胜利。我们要进一步开展“拥军爱民”运动，加强军民团结，加强和巩固无产阶级专政。我们一定要按照毛主席最近的指示，“斗私，批修”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把上海真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校！
    庆祝大会之后，开始了气势磅礴的盛大节日游行！威武雄壮的游行队伍，在欢声雷动中昂首阔步，浩浩荡荡，向前挺进。闪耀着万道金光的巨型毛主席塑像，矗立在游行队伍的最前列。五百多人组成的乐队，紧跟在毛主席的巨像后面，高奏《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲。最最敬爱的毛主席！我们要千秋万代歌颂您，我们要永远跟着您，我们一定遵照您最亲密的战友林彪副主席的指示，永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好学生、好战士！
    在乐队后面的是工、农、兵、学、商各条战线的队伍。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军指战员，全副武装，雄赳赳、气昂昂地参加了集会游行。无限忠于毛主席革命路线的驻沪三军，在反对帝国主义侵略、保卫社会主义国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争中，作出了杰出的贡献；在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又坚决响应毛主席的人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的号召，以最大的热情，纷纷奔赴“三支”“两军”的第一线，热情宣传毛泽东思想，在无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民建立了不朽的新功勋。
    游行的队伍中，还有一支上海工人革命派的武装队伍。这支由工人革命派组成的全副武装的队伍，阵容威严，高举着鲜红的大旗昂首挺进，显示了上海人民决心进一步加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压国内外阶级敌人的破坏活动，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的坚强意志。
    革命小将红卫兵和红小兵的队伍，更是朝气蓬勃、英姿焕发，显示了“军政训练”的巨大成果。革命小将们向伟大统帅毛主席宣誓：一定要活学活用毛主席著作，做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决响应毛主席“复课闹革命”的伟大号召，巩固、发展革命大联合和革命“三结合”，在革命大批判和斗批改的斗争中冲锋陷阵，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彻底批深批透，批倒批臭；他们决心狠夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，努力克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，把自己锻炼成大公无私的无产阶级革命战士。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了丰功伟绩的上海工人阶级，今天，举着“上海工人革命造反总司令部”的鲜红大旗，威武雄壮地前进。这支拥有一百多万工人革命大军的革命队伍，最听毛主席的话，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。是他们顶逆风、战恶浪，打退了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，粉碎了反革命经济主义妖风；是他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发出了“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干”的豪迈誓言；是他们在千军万马围剿中国赫鲁晓夫的革命大批判中，当之无愧地发挥了主力军的作用；是他们把毛主席的最新指示立即化为行动，一马当先，掀起了一个革命的大批判、革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”的新高潮；是他们积极贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在人民解放军的坚强支持下，使许多国家建设和人民生活需要的重要产品，产量不断增长，质量稳步提高，原材料消耗不断下降，还试制成功和生产了许多重要的新产品。
    参加游行的还有农业、财贸、教育、科技、文艺、医务卫生、新闻、出版、体育等各条战线的无产阶级革命派战士。已经取得农业大丰收的上海郊区广大人民公社社员，也参加了今天的游行，他们决心做到农业“六好”，夺取今年农业的更大丰收。上海革命文艺工作者，在光辉的毛泽东文艺思想指引下，在文化革命的英勇旗手江青同志的关怀下，成功地创作演出了一出又一出革命样板戏；同时组成千百支工农兵文艺小分队深入工厂、农村，为当前的政治斗争服务。
