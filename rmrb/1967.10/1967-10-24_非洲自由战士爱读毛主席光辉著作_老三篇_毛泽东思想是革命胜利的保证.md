African freedom fighters love reading Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Constantly Read Articles." They enthusiastically praise "Three Constantly Read Articles" as the "key to revolution" and the "beacon of victory."

A Mozambican freedom fighter, Amis, said that "Three Constantly Read Articles" calls on revolutionaries to bravely fight for the people's interests. He quoted Chairman Mao's words: "The Chinese people are suffering, and we have the responsibility to save them. We must strive to fight." "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." He also said, "Now our Mozambican people are suffering, and we have the responsibility to save them."

A young Mozambican freedom fighter shared his thoughts on studying "Three Constantly Read Articles." He said, "We should learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's internationalist spirit. The oppressed people of Mozambique must unite with the oppressed people and nations of other regions in Africa to overthrow imperialism and colonialism."

A freedom fighter from southern Africa talked about his change in thinking after studying "Three Constantly Read Articles." He said that when he first joined the armed struggle, he only knew how to avenge himself and his family. After studying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," he understood that participating in the revolutionary struggle is for the liberation of our people, not for personal gain. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to go where the difficulties are, and to fight bravely for the liberation of our country.

An old African freedom fighter said that the Chinese people, with the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," moved the mountains that weighed on them. He said, "We must carry forward the spirit of 'Resolving to overcome all difficulties, daring to sacrifice, and striving for victory.' We must remove the mountain of imperialism and colonialism that weighs on the African people." He pointed out, "'The Foolish Old Man' has perseverance and determination. This spirit is very important for the African people and all people fighting against imperialism and colonialism. If we follow Chairman Mao's teachings in our struggle, we can overcome all difficulties and move from victory to victory."

Some leaders of African freedom fighters, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "Our cadres must care for every soldier, and all revolutionary troops must care for, love, and help each other," felt particularly inspired and helped. A squad leader named Bantu, following Chairman Mao's teachings, treated soldiers with equality, patiently and enthusiastically helped them train, and earned the respect and praise of the soldiers.

Many African freedom fighters, through their personal experiences, deeply felt that "the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the spiritual atomic bomb of the revolutionary people of the world," "Mao Zedong Thought is the source of victory in revolutionary struggle." They said, "We will forever follow our Chairman Mao!" They shouted in different languages, "Long live the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao!"

    非洲自由战士爱读毛主席光辉著作“老三篇”
    毛泽东思想是革命胜利的保证
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　非洲自由战士爱读毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。他们热情赞扬“老三篇”是“革命的钥匙”和“胜利的灯塔”。
    莫三鼻给自由战士阿米斯说，“老三篇”要求革命者为了人民的利益而勇敢战斗。他引用毛主席的话说：“中国人民正在受难，我们有责任解救他们，我们要努力奋斗。”“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。他还说：“现在我们莫三鼻给人民正在受难，我们有责任解救他们。”
    一位莫三鼻给年青的自由战士谈了他学习“老三篇”的心得体会。他说：“我们应当学习白求恩同志的国际主义精神。我们莫三鼻给的被压迫人民必须同非洲其他地区的被压迫人民和民族联合起来，推翻帝国主义和殖民主义。”
    一位非洲南部的自由战士谈了他在学习了“老三篇”之后的思想变化。他说，他刚参加武装斗争时，只知道为自己和家庭报仇，在学习了毛主席的“老三篇”以后，才懂得了参加革命斗争是为了解放我国人民，不是为了个人。我决心按照毛主席的教导，那里困难大，就勇敢地到那里去战斗，为我国的解放而流血斗争。
    一位非洲老自由战士说，中国人民以“愚公移山”的精神搬走了压在他们身上的大山。他说：“我们必须发扬
  ‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’的精神，搬开压在我们非洲人民身上的大山——帝国主义和殖民主义。”他指出：“‘愚公’有毅力，有决心。这种精神对于我们为争取民族解放而斗争的非洲人民和一切反对帝国主义和殖民主义的人民是非常重要的。我们在斗争中按照毛主席的教导办事，就能够克服一切困难，从胜利走向胜利。”
    一些非洲自由战士的负责人在学习了毛主席关于“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导之后，感到启发和帮助特别大。一位名叫班图的班长按照毛主席的这一教导，以平等的态度对待士兵，热情耐心地帮助他们训练，得到了士兵的尊敬和赞扬。
    非洲许多自由战士以他们的亲身经历，深深感到：“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的精神原子弹”，“毛泽东思想是革命斗争胜利的源泉”。他们说：“我们将永远跟着我们的毛主席！”他们用不同的语言欢呼：“世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席万万岁！”
