The Indian reactionary government's actions over the past month in the Sino-Indian border issue have further exposed the fact that this reactionary government relies on two counter-revolutionary tactics to maintain its rule. On one hand, it sacrifices Indian soldiers' blood and lives to provoke China militarily, aiming to gain rewards from US imperialists and Soviet revisionists. On the other hand, it fabricates lies to deceive the Indian people and world opinion, relying on lies to survive. To coincide with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai's visit to Washington and Defense Minister Swaran Singh's visit to Moscow, the Indian reactionary government on September 11th ordered Indian troops to launch a four-day armed attack on Chinese border defense forces along the Sino-Indian border. As expected, as soon as the Indian army's guns fired along the Sino-Indian border, Desai secured grain, cotton, oil, and loans from the United States. Now, as Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi prepares to visit Moscow, on October 1st, the National Day of the People's Republic of China, Indian troops again opened fire on Chinese border defense forces at the Zola Pass along the Sino-Indian border. Over the years, the Indian reactionaries have increasingly relied on selling national interests, brazenly opposing China, and leaning on US imperialists and Soviet revisionists for survival. Now, they are even willing to use Indian soldiers' blood and lives as a price to provoke China militarily to gain favor with US imperialists and Soviet revisionists. This fully shows how pathetic the Indian reactionary government has become.

The two armed provocations along the Sino-Indian border were clearly instigated by the Indian reactionary government. However, to deceive the Indian people and world opinion, it fabricated lies through statements from the Ministry of Defense and diplomatic notes, claiming that "India has not provoked any incidents" and that India was subjected to "unprovoked" attacks. In fact, Indian military representatives who came to China to identify bodies both times signed and acknowledged that these Indian military corpses were left behind after being killed while invading Chinese territory. They also acknowledged that Indian military weapons and ammunition were left behind after the Indian military was driven back into Chinese territory. The Indian military representatives had to admit on the spot that the Indian reactionaries' aggression against China had suffered a "shameful defeat." These irrefutable facts have given the Indian reactionary government a series of resounding slaps in the face.

In its diplomatic note to the Chinese government, the Indian government also proposed so-called suggestions such as "meetings between commanders of both sides" and "reducing tensions." This is purely a tactic of the pot calling the kettle black. The tense situation is entirely created by the Indian government. As long as the Indian government stops military provocations, the tense situation will naturally disappear. The Indian government also has to admit that the Sino-Indian border is clearly demarcated and there is no dispute, so what is the need for "meetings between commanders of both sides"?

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "The rampancy of dark forces represents their last struggle and also represents the people's approaching victory." The Indian army's two armed provocations along the Sino-Indian border fully show that the Indian reactionary government is more reactionary now than at any time in the past. It also shows that this reactionary government has reached a dead end, and its days are numbered.

    猖狂反华以博取美帝苏修犒赏　编造谎言妄图欺骗世界舆论
    印度政府对我发动武装进攻铁证如山不容抵赖
    据新华社七日讯　本社记者报道：近一个月来，印度反动政府在中锡边境问题上的所作所为，更加清楚地说明，这个反动政府就是靠反革命的两手来延续其反动统治的。一方面它以印度士兵鲜血和生命为代价，对中国进行武装挑衅，以博取美帝苏修的犒赏；另一方面，它整天编造谎言，欺骗印度人民和世界舆论，靠撒谎过日子。印度反动派为了配合副总理兼财政部长德赛的华盛顿之行和国防部长斯瓦兰·辛格到莫斯科的访问，在九月十一日驱使印度军队在中锡边界向中国边防部队发动了四天的武装攻击。果然，中锡边界印军的炮声一响，德赛就从美国捞到了粮食、棉花、食油和贷款。现在，印度总理英迪拉·甘地又要到莫斯科访问了，于是，就在十月一日，中华人民共和国国庆节这一天，印度军队又一次在中锡边界的卓拉山口向中国边防部队开火。印度反动派这些年来，日甚一日地靠出卖民族利益，猖狂反华，投靠美帝、苏修过日子。如今竟然不惜再次拿印度士兵的鲜血和生命作代价，对中国进行军事挑衅，换取美帝、苏修的欢心。这充分表明，印度反动政府已经堕落到了怎样可悲的境地。
    在中锡边界的两次武装挑衅，明明是印度反动政府一手制造的。但是，它为了欺骗印度人民和世界舆论，却通过国防部发言人谈话、外交部照会，胡说什么“印度没有进行任何挑衅”，印度遭到了“无端”的进攻等等。事实上，两次印方派到中国境内认领尸体的印军代表都签字画押，承认这些印军尸体是在侵入中国领土时被击毙后留下的，承认印军的枪枝弹药是在印军被击退时遗弃在中国境内的。印军代表当场也不得不承认，印度反动派对中国的侵略“遭到了可耻的失败”。这些无可抵赖的事实，给了印度反动政府一记又一记响亮的耳光。
    印度政府在给中国政府的照会中，还提出什么“双方指挥官会晤”、“减少紧张局势”等所谓建议。这完全是一种贼喊捉贼的手法。紧张局势完全是印度政府一手造成的。只要印度政府停止军事挑衅，紧张局势自然就不存在了。印度政府也不得不承认中锡边界是明确划定了的，并不存在任何争执，有什么必要搞“双方指挥官会晤”呢？
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说，黑暗势力的猖獗，“表示了它们的最后挣扎”，也“表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利”。印军在中锡边境的两次武装挑衅充分说明，印度反动政府现在比它过去任何时候都更加反动，同时也说明，这个反动政府已经走到了山穷水尽的绝路，它的寿命不长了。
