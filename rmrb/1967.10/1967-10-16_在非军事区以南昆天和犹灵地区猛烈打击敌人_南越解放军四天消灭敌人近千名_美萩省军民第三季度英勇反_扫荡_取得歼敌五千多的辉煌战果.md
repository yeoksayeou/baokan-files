In the regions of Kun Tian and Yu Ling south of the demilitarized zone, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army has launched fierce attacks against the enemy. Over four days, nearly a thousand enemy soldiers were eliminated.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in the regions south of the demilitarized zone launched continuous and fierce attacks on the enemy in Kun Tian and the eastern part of Yu Ling from September 22 to 25, achieving a major victory by eliminating nearly a thousand American and puppet soldiers.

On September 22, the liberation forces in Kun Tian used fierce and accurate artillery fire to strike the U.S. Marine Corps base in the southern part of the Trung An region in Kun Tian, eliminating nearly 150 enemy soldiers. In the following two days, the liberation forces again fiercely bombarded the Trung An and Kun Tian American bases, eliminating more than 260 American aggressors.

On the morning of September 25, the liberation forces fiercely bombarded the U.S. Marine Corps stationed 2 kilometers southeast of Kun Tian, eliminating 120 enemy soldiers and destroying multiple military vehicles.

In the eastern part of Yu Ling County, the liberation forces attacked the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment, and the puppet army's 2nd Airborne Division, 1st Regiment on September 22 and 23, killing and wounding more than 160 enemy soldiers, including more than 100 American invaders.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the military and people of My Tho Province in South Vietnam have achieved a glorious victory by eliminating 5,350 enemy soldiers in July, August, and September. They have continuously disrupted the enemy's supply lines, fiercely attacked enemy bases, and bravely repelled enemy "sweeping" operations.

Among the eliminated enemy soldiers, there were 2,180 American soldiers.

The heroic military and people of My Tho Province have completely annihilated an American camp command, three companies, and one platoon, as well as three puppet army companies and three "pacification" teams. Additionally, they have destroyed 21 enemy bunkers, 90 military vehicles, 36 military ships, and 20 enemy aircraft, and seized a large amount of weapons.

The report states that the most outstanding achievement of the military and people of My Tho Province in this period is their comprehensive offensive on the supply lines, which has completely disrupted the enemy's military transportation on the Fourth Strategic Highway from Saigon to the western region, causing the enemy's military transportation to come to a standstill. In addition to eliminating a large number of enemy soldiers and destroying a large number of enemy vehicles on the supply lines, the military and people of My Tho Province have also fiercely attacked the enemy's headquarters in My Tho City, the American base in Phuoc Long, and the enemy's military support areas in Cai Ngai, An Hau, and Cai Ly, eliminating many American and puppet soldiers. Inspired by the victorious situation, tens of thousands of people have risen up to destroy more than 40 enemy "strategic villages."

At the same time, the military and people of My Tho Province have also smashed two large-scale "sweeping" operations by tens of thousands of American and puppet soldiers, protected and consolidated the liberated areas, with the support of hundreds of military ships, numerous aircraft, and artillery.
