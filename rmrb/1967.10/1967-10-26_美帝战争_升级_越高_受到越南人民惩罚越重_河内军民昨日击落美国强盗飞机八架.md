The higher the U.S. imperialist war "escalates," the heavier the punishment by the Vietnamese people. Hanoi military and civilians shoot down eight U.S. aggressor planes yesterday

	The U.S. aggressor planes once again invaded the airspace above Hanoi on the 25th, repeatedly and indiscriminately attacking densely populated areas in the city and its suburbs. However, the higher the U.S. aggressors "escalate," the harder they fall. Their new acts of aggression have once again received the punishment they deserve. According to reports from here, the military and civilians of Hanoi shot down eight U.S. aggressor planes today and captured multiple U.S. air pirates.

	At 4:15 PM on the 25th, multiple batches of U.S. aggressor planes repeatedly and indiscriminately attacked densely populated areas in the city and its suburbs. The heroic anti-aircraft artillery units, the people's air force, and the self-defense militia worked together calmly and bravely, seizing the opportunity to fight fiercely and accurately, giving the U.S. aggressors a severe blow. In the first round of fire, multiple U.S. aggressor planes were hit and crashed.

	Thus, in the two days of the 24th and 25th, the military and civilians of Hanoi shot down a total of thirteen U.S. aggressor planes.

	According to reports from here, the brave military and civilians of Hanoi shot down five enemy planes on the 24th. On the same day, the military and civilians of Vinh Phuc Province shot down two enemy planes, while the military and civilians of Hai Phong City and Bac Ninh Province each shot down one enemy plane. The military and civilians of Hai Phong City and Lao Cai Province each shot down one enemy plane on the 23rd.

	According to reports from here, the military and civilians of Hai Phong in North Vietnam continued to fight against the invading U.S. aggressor planes, shooting down one on the 17th, and two on both the 18th and 22nd.
