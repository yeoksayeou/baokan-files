The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is located in the western part of the Sahara Desert in Africa, on the eastern shore of the Atlantic Ocean. It covers an area of 1,169,000 square kilometers and has a population of one million. The majority of the residents are Moors, with other tribes including the Toucouleur and Sarakolle. Almost the entire population practices Islam. The capital is Nouakchott.

Mauritania declared independence on November 28, 1960, and announced its desire to cooperate with all nations. Mauritania follows a policy of non-alignment and supports the struggles of Asian and African peoples against imperialism and neo-colonialism. In August 1961, Moktar Ould Daddah was elected as the first president and has served continuously since then. In October 1964, President Daddah sent a telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai, agreeing to China's proposal to convene a summit of world leaders to discuss the issue of a comprehensive ban and complete destruction of nuclear weapons. On July 19, 1965, diplomatic relations were formally established between China and Mauritania, marking a new stage in the friendly cooperation between the two peoples. Over the past two years, the two countries have exchanged visits by trade union, youth, and cultural delegations, enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. This year in February, at the invitation of China, a government delegation from the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Planning, Biram M'Bareck Ould Vira, visited China. During the visit, Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese and world revolutionary peoples, met with Minister Biram M'Bareck Ould Vira and the entire delegation, engaging in sincere and cordial conversations. The two sides also signed trade agreements, economic and technical cooperation agreements, and cultural cooperation agreements based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual support, and mutual understanding. The visit by the Mauritania government delegation enhanced the friendship between the Chinese and Mauritania peoples and further developed the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

Mauritania's economy is primarily based on livestock farming. Within the vast Sahara Desert of Mauritania, there are rich deposits of iron and copper. Since gaining independence, Mauritania has made significant achievements in developing its education sector and has taken effective measures to consolidate national independence and develop the national economy.

In the 15th century, European colonizers infiltrated Mauritania, engaging in the crime of slave trading and plundering local resources. From the early 19th century, French colonial forces invaded Mauritania. By 1912, Mauritania had become a French colony. However, the Mauritania people's struggle against colonial rule never ceased. After World War II, the Mauritania people's anti-colonial struggle, under the influence of the rising tide of national independence movements in Africa, became more widespread and in-depth. In November 1958, Mauritania became an "autonomous republic" within the "French Community." On November 28, 1960, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania declared independence and later withdrew from the "French Community."

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mauritania, the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries have continued to develop on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This visit by President Daddah to China will make new contributions to the further development of Sino-Mauritanian friendship.

    毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国
    毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国位于非洲撒哈拉大沙漠西部，大西洋东岸，面积一百一十六万九千平方公里，人口一百万。居民主要是摩尔人，其他还有图库列尔人、萨拉科列人等许多部族，几乎全部信奉伊斯兰教。首都是努瓦克肖特。
    毛里塔尼亚于一九六○年十一月二十八日宣布独立，并宣告，毛里塔尼亚希望同各国合作。毛里塔尼亚奉行不结盟政策，支持亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。一九六一年八月达达赫当选为第一任总统，连任至今。一九六四年十月，达达赫总统曾经致电周恩来总理，同意我国关于召开世界各国首脑会议讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器问题的建议。一九六五年七月十九日，中毛两国正式建立外交关系，使我们两国人民的友好合作关系进入了一个新的阶段。两年多来，两国多次互派工会、青年、文化等代表团进行了友好访问，增进了两国人民之间的友谊。今年二月，应我国邀请，由外交和计划部长比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼率领的毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国政府代表团来我国进行了友好访问。在访问期间，中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席接见了比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼部长和代表团全体成员，并同他们进行了诚挚、亲切的谈话。双方还在平等互利、互相支援、互相谅解的基础上，签订了符合两国人民利益的贸易协定、经济技术合作协定和文化合作协定。毛里塔尼亚政府代表团的这次访问，增进了中国和毛里塔尼亚人民的友谊，并且发展了我们两国的友好合作关系。
    毛里塔尼亚的经济以畜牧业为主。在毛里塔尼亚辽阔的撒哈拉大沙漠里，还蕴藏着丰富的铁矿、铜矿等资源。毛里塔尼亚独立后，在发展教育事业方面取得了显著的成绩，在巩固民族独立、发展民族经济方面，也采取了一些有效措施。
    在十五世纪时，欧洲殖民者渗入毛里塔尼亚，从事贩卖奴隶的罪行，掠夺当地的财物。自十九世纪初，法国殖民军侵入毛里塔尼亚。到一九一二年，毛里塔尼亚沦为法国殖民地。但是，毛里塔尼亚人民反抗殖民统治的英勇斗争一直没有停止过。第二次世界大战后，毛里塔尼亚人民的反殖民主义斗争在非洲民族独立运动全面高涨的形势下，更加广泛、深入地开展起来。一九五八年十一月，毛里塔尼亚成为“法兰西共同体”内的“自治共和国”。一九六○年十一月二十八日，毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国宣告独立，后来退出“法兰西共同体”。
    中国和毛里塔尼亚两国建交以来，我们两国的友好合作关系，在和平共处的五项原则基础上，不断发展。这次达达赫总统前来访问中国，将为中毛两国的友谊进一步发展作出新的贡献。（新华社）
