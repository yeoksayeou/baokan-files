We can rely on our own organized strength to defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries."

		Prime Minister Noumazalaye made an enthusiastic speech after the visit. He said, "You have re-enacted the story that Chairman Mao mentioned in his essay 'Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.'

Your socialist construction will promote the progress of the whole society."

		Prime Minister Noumazalaye said, "You have concretely implemented Mao Zedong Thought. When we return to our country, we will tell our people about your great work. The people of our country will also implement Mao Zedong Thought to build their own country. We will also do our best to promote the development of the whole society with our construction achievements."

		He concluded with a passionate shout: "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Congo (Brazzaville) and the People's Republic of China! Long live, long live, ten thousand years to the great leader Chairman Mao!"

		Prime Minister Noumazalaye's speech was warmly welcomed by the brigade members.

		The Congolese (Brazzaville) Ambassador to China, Bazanga, accompanied the visit.
