On the occasion of the 18th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, Comrade Lin Biao conveyed Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism to the entire army and people. This great call has pointed the way for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and shown the path for the proletarian revolutionaries to temper and grow in the stormy seas of class struggle. We wholeheartedly support it and will carry it out to the letter!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a tremendous mass movement. In this great storm of class struggle, every event tests and educates us. Lenin said, "In the course of a revolution, the people learn more in a week than they do in years of ordinary life." Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Second Artillery have been tempered and tested in the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have become stronger under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

The great leader Chairman Mao has instructed us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Under this great guideline, we will further cultivate and train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, carry on Mao Zedong Thought, and be revolutionaries of Mao Zedong Thought.

To be revolutionaries of Mao Zedong Thought, we must overcome the "self" in our minds. In the past year of the Cultural Revolution, we have followed Chairman Mao's teachings on guiding petty-bourgeois thinking onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat. We have fought against rightist conservative thoughts, advocating the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and rebel, and have also firmly fought against the anarchist trends that appear in "leftist" forms, thereby strengthening our revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "A change in world outlook is a fundamental change." As revolutionaries of Mao Zedong Thought, we must work hard on transforming our world outlook. In this great revolution, we have taken the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles and constantly examined ourselves against the five conditions for being a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause proposed by Chairman Mao, enabling us to grow rapidly in the struggle.

To be revolutionaries of Mao Zedong Thought, we must thoroughly criticize revisionism using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, in terms of politics, ideology, and theory, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism in all aspects.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Our Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of mass struggle, and this world is the great world of mass struggle." Flowers cultivated in a greenhouse cannot withstand wind and rain and have no vitality. Only by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines can one become a true successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Cultivating and training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is a matter of paramount importance concerning the future and destiny of our Party and state, a matter of strategic significance for thousands of years. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will carry out the fight against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism to the end, follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, and be revolutionaries of Mao Zedong Thought for life!

    永做毛泽东思想的革命派
    第二炮兵直属机关无产阶级革命派
    在举国上下欢庆伟大祖国建国十八周年的光辉节日里，林副主席向全国军民传达了伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的战斗号召。这一伟大号召，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利指明了方向；也给无产阶级革命派在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼和成长指出了途径。我们一千个拥护！一万个照办！
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场惊天动地的群众运动，在这阶级斗争的大风大浪里，每一件事情都在考验和教育着我们。列宁说过：“在革命时期千百万人民一个星期内学到的东西，比他们平常在一年糊涂的生活中所学到的还要多。”我们第二炮兵无产阶级革命派，一年多来，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，受到了极大的锻炼和考验，在毛泽东思想哺育下变得更加坚强。
    伟大领袖毛主席指示我们，要斗私，批修。我们一定在这个伟大方针的指引下，进一步培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人，接毛泽东思想的班，做毛泽东思想革命派。
    要做毛泽东思想的革命派，必须斗倒自己头脑里的“私”字。我们在一年的文化大革命中，遵循毛主席关于把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命轨道的教导，既同右倾保守思想作斗争，发扬敢想、敢说、敢革命、敢造反的革命精神，又同以“左”的形式出现的无政府主义思潮进行了坚决斗争，加强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。作为毛泽东思想的革命派，一定要在改造世界观上狠下功夫。我们在这场大革命中，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，处处以毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件为镜子，对照检查自己，使我们在斗争中得到了迅速的成长。
    要做毛泽东思想的革命派，就是要用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想彻底批判修正主义，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底肃清修正主义在各个方面的流毒。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”温室里培养出来的花朵，是经不起风吹雨打的，是没有生命力的。真正的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，只有在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，才能产生。
    培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人，是关系到我们党和国家前途和命运的头等大事，是千年大计，万年大计。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线，把“斗私，批修”进行到底，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，做一辈子毛泽东思想的革命派！
