The Japanese Communist Party (Leftist Faction) organization firmly supports the anti-American patriotic just struggle of Japanese progressive students. They call on the people to rise up and overthrow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Kyomoto faction.

New China News Agency, October 16th: Tokyo news: The Japanese Communist Party (Leftist Faction) organization actively supports the anti-American patriotic just struggle of Japanese patriotic youth students who, on October 8th, took action at Tokyo's Haneda Airport to oppose the pro-American traitor Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's activities in South Vietnam. They strongly protest against the Sato reactionary government's massacre of patriotic students participating in this struggle and angrily condemn the Kyomoto revisionist faction's slander of the patriotic students' just struggle. They call on the Japanese people to rise up and overthrow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Kyomoto revisionist faction.

The Japanese Communist Party Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee (Leftist Faction) stated in a declaration on the 9th that the young students and workers who took action at Haneda Airport, "based on the wishes of the Japanese people, fearlessly and selflessly stood up and took the lead in the great struggle. This is a patriotic and just heroic action."

The declaration expressed deep sorrow for the patriotic student Yamazaki Hiroaki, who was killed by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The declaration said, "We will tread on the blood of the martyrs and launch a revolutionary struggle to smash the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries."

The declaration also exposed that the Japanese Communist Party traitor Kyomoto revisionist faction, on the day students were in fierce struggle with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries (October 8th), gathered tens of thousands of people at Lake Tama to sing and dance, holding a so-called "Red Flag Newspaper Festival." The declaration said, "What is even more intolerable is that the Kyomoto revisionist faction openly stood on the side of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, shouting that the struggle at Haneda Airport was a 'conflict between extreme leftist counter-revolutionaries and reactionary forces,' saying that this incident 'will lead to further suppression of democratic forces by the enemy.' This fully exposes the revisionist elements as a bunch of despicable cowards. The traitor Kyomoto Hideji and the traitor Sato Eisaku are completely in cahoots, aiming their guns at the patriotic youth students at the forefront of the anti-American struggle. People have once again seen through the Kyomoto revisionist faction's role as a special operations force for the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in this struggle.

The declaration calls on all county and national people to immediately launch large-scale protest actions against the Sato government's suppression and massacre of patriotic students and against Sato's "visit" to South Vietnam.

The Japanese Communist Party Shimonoseki Regional Committee (Leftist Faction), the Japanese Communist Party Keishu Regional Committee (within Fukuoka Prefecture) (Leftist Faction), and other organizations have also issued declarations, strongly protesting against the Sato government's fascist atrocities of killing patriotic youth students and determined to carry the anti-American patriotic struggle to the end.

The Japanese "Chōshū Shinbun" published an editorial on the 11th, enthusiastically supporting the patriotic youth students' brave anti-American struggle. The editorial said, "We will launch an even higher wave of struggle, with the iron fist of the people thoroughly smashing the Sato government, thoroughly smashing the Kyomoto revisionist faction, and driving their master, American imperialism, out of Japan and Asia!"

　　日共（左派）组织坚决支持日本进步学生反美爱国正义斗争
　　号召人民起来打倒美日反动派和宫本集团
    新华社十六日讯　东京消息：日本共产党（左派）组织，积极支持日本爱国青年学生八日为反对日本亲美卖国首相佐藤荣作到南越去活动而在东京羽田机场进行的反美爱国正义斗争，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府残杀参加这次斗争的爱国学生，愤怒谴责宫本修正主义集团诽谤爱国学生的正义斗争，号召日本人民起来打倒美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团。
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）在九日发表的声明中指出，在羽田机场进行斗争的青年学生和工人，“根据日本人民的愿望，不怕困难，不怕牺牲，挺身而出，站在伟大斗争的前列，这是爱国的正义的英雄行动”。
    声明对被美日反动派杀害的爱国学生山崎博昭表示深切的哀悼。声明说，我们要踏着烈士的血迹，展开粉碎美日反动派的革命斗争。
    声明还揭露，日共叛徒宫本修正主义集团在学生同美日反动派进行激烈斗争当天（十月八日），召集数万人到多摩湖公园去唱歌跳舞，举行所谓“赤旗报节”。声明说，更令人不能容忍的是宫本修正主义集团公然站在美日反动派的立场上，叫嚷羽田机场的斗争是“极左的反革命分子和反动势力的冲突”，说什么这一事件“将导致敌人对民主力量进一步镇压”。这就充分暴露了修正主义分子们是一伙不可救药的卑鄙的胆小鬼。叛徒宫本显治一伙和卖国贼佐藤荣作完全串通一气，把枪口对准了站在反美斗争前列的爱国青年学生。人们从这一斗争中又一次看清了宫本修正主义集团充当美日反动派的别动队的面目。
    声明号召全县、全国人民立即展开反对佐藤政府镇压、残杀爱国学生，反对佐藤“访问”南越的大规模的抗议行动。
    日本共产党下关地区委员会（左派）、日本共产党京筑地区（在福冈县内）委员会（左派）等组织，也纷纷发表声明，强烈抗议佐藤政府杀害爱国青年学生的法西斯暴行，决心要把反美爱国斗争进行到底。
    日本《长周新闻》十一日发表社论，热烈支持爱国青年学生的反美英勇斗争。社论说，我们要掀起更高的斗争浪潮，以人民的铁拳彻底粉碎佐藤政府，彻底粉碎宫本修正主义集团，把它们的主子美帝国主义从日本和亚洲赶出去！
