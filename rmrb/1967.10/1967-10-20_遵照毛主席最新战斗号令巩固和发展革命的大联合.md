In accordance with Chairman Mao's latest battle order, we will consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance. The Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group have issued a notice on implementing revolutionary great alliances by system. This is a new battle order issued by Chairman Mao to us, the revolutionary masses. We revolutionary masses firmly support it and will carry it out without any compromise. We are determined to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, to carry out thorough criticism and struggle, and to implement reform in our unit.

In our Second Attachment Factory, under the guidance of the PLA comrades, we achieved revolutionary great alliances by class in June this year and have now established a revolutionary committee preparatory group. From the practice of over three months since the class alliances, we have deeply felt Chairman Mao's great wisdom. Only by continuously advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao can we achieve continuous revolutionary victories. At the same time, we have also felt that only by achieving revolutionary great alliances by system, by industry, and by class can we promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination, which is beneficial to thorough criticism and struggle and to the implementation of reform in our unit. This will ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" and is beneficial to "criticize and repudiate self and revise and criticize revisionism" to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Before our factory achieved the revolutionary great alliance, the criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road was often fragmented; each criticized in their own way, and the strength was dispersed. After the alliance, the steps were unified, and the firepower was concentrated, making these elements sink into the vast ocean of people's war. Before the alliance, there were many obstacles in the criticism and struggle and reform in our unit due to the different opinions among various organizations. After the alliance, problems could be studied and discussed together, and many things became easier. Before the alliance, the production team and group leaders had no authoritative command, and they could only command the production activities of people from their own organization, making it difficult to command those from other organizations. After the alliance, this phenomenon was eliminated, and production changed. Everyone is determined to strive to complete this year's production plan half a month in advance. Before the alliance, several mass organizations each held their own small turf, and whatever they had, they had to have their own set. After the alliance, materials could be concentrated for use. Before the alliance, the attitude towards revolutionary cadres often focused on which side they stood on. After the alliance, the small turfs were leveled, and the views on cadres became more consistent, liberating many revolutionary cadres and creating conditions for the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

　　遵照毛主席最新战斗号令巩固和发展革命的大联合
　　北京东方红汽车制造厂第二附件厂革命委员会筹委会
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革发出了关于按照系统实行革命大联合的通知，这是毛主席向我们无产阶级革命派发出的新的战斗号令。我们无产阶级革命派坚决拥护，不折不扣地照办，决心进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。
    我们第二附件厂的各个革命群众组织，在解放军同志的帮助下，今年六月，按照班组实现了革命的大联合，现在又建立起革命委员会筹委会。从班组联合以后三个多月的实践中，我们深刻地体会到毛主席的英明、伟大，只有不断地朝着毛主席指出的方向前进，才能不断地取得革命的胜利。同时我们也体会到，只有按照系统、按照行业、按照班级，实现革命大联合，才能促进革命的三结合，才能有利于革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，才能确保毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大指示的贯彻执行，才有利于“斗私，批修”，把文化大革命进行到底。
    我们厂实现革命大联合以前，批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，往往是你批你的，我批我的，力量分散；联合以后，步调一致，火力集中，使这些家伙们陷入人民战争的汪洋大海之中。联合以前，对本单位的斗批改，也由于各组织间的不同意见无法统一，障碍很多；联合以后，有问题大家能一起研究讨论，许多事情好办了。联合以前，生产班、组长没有指挥领导的权威，他们只能指挥同自己一个组织的人的生产活动，难以指挥属于其他组织的人；联合以后，这种现象消除了，生产变了样，大家决心争取提前半月完成今年全年生产计划。联合以前，几个群众组织各自抱着自己的小山头，用什么东西都是你有一套，我也得有一套；联合以后，物资能够集中使用了。联合以前，对待革命干部，往往是着眼于他站在那边；联合以后，削平了山头，对干部的看法容易一致了，解放了许多革命干部，为实现革命三结合创造了条件。
