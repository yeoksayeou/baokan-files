The Eighth Congress of the Democratic Party of Guinea was held from September 25 to October 2 in the newly completed "October 2 Hall" in Conakry. Guinea's President and Party Secretary General, Sekou Toure, delivered a lengthy political report on behalf of the National Political Bureau. In his report, he reaffirmed Guinea's stance against imperialism and neo-colonialism, and its commitment to maintaining national independence.

Discussing the current international situation, Toure said that after the oppressed peoples' active struggles and undeniable victories in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, imperialist and colonialist forces have launched a full-scale offensive against the peoples of various countries. He pointed out: "There is a prevailing view internationally that peace is about avoiding conflicts between the East and West, between the capitalist world and the socialist world. This view is wrong, and we condemn it." He said: "Imperialism is playing and exploiting 'peaceful coexistence,' and it is unimaginable that imperialism would willingly dig its own grave." He believed that the progressive forces of the world must unite and fight to eliminate imperialism.

Regarding the United Nations, Toure said: "The United Nations is impotent." He stated that the Security Council has become "a true den of intrigue for big powers to conduct transactions," and it "seriously obstructs the progress of the oppressed peoples of various countries." Toure pointed out that the current United Nations must undergo a thorough change, and all its institutions, especially those active on the African continent, must undergo equally profound changes immediately. He also mentioned that the People's Republic of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, has been arbitrarily deprived of its legitimate rights in the United Nations.

President Toure expressed his full support for the African freedom fighters in their struggle to overthrow foreign rule. When talking about African unity, he emphasized that "African unity must be the unity of the anti-imperialist front in Africa." He hoped that African countries would learn from the recent events in the Middle East.

Regarding domestic economic construction, Toure particularly emphasized the importance of developing Guinea's agriculture and pointed out that this is the key to the victory of Guinea's industrialization. He stressed the need to adopt the principle of self-reliance.

The head of the Chinese government's friendly delegation, Lin Haiyun, who was visiting Guinea, was invited to speak at the congress. He conveyed the warm congratulations of the Chinese government and people to the congress. He expressed his heartfelt joy at the victories and achievements of the Guinean people in their struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, and in the development of their national economy under the leadership of the Democratic Party of Guinea.

Comrade Lin Haiyun pointed out that the current world situation is excellent, and the situation in Africa is also excellent. He said: "The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people is deepening. The great tide of the African people's struggle against imperialism and for national independence is unstoppable by anyone." Comrade Lin Haiyun said: "At present, China is undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. We believe that through this cultural revolution, our people will make new and greater contributions to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world." When talking about the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean peoples, Comrade Lin Haiyun said: "The two countries have always sympathized with and supported each other in the anti-imperialist struggle. The 700 million Chinese people are determined to march forward shoulder to shoulder with the Guinean people, holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism!"

During Comrade Lin Haiyun's speech, applause was continuous, especially when mentioning the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, the entire audience gave a prolonged and enthusiastic applause. After the speech, the entire audience stood up and gave a warm applause. President Toure walked forward and warmly embraced Comrade Lin Haiyun, expressing his thanks.

At the closing ceremony, the congress unanimously passed a motion to pay tribute to China and to strengthen Sino-Guinean friendly cooperation. The motion stated: "At this solemn moment in the history of the Guinean people, the congress extends its warmest congratulations to the Chinese workers who have contributed to the rapid and successful completion of our beautiful 'October 2 Hall' under the best conditions. The congress expresses its respect to the Chinese government and, through it, to the entire Chinese people for the particularly active results of our cooperation, especially in the implementation of the economic and social development plan of the Republic of Guinea." The motion further stated: "The congress finally reaffirms the Guinean people's willingness to strengthen and expand the fraternal and combative cooperation between the two countries in all aspects."

The congress finally elected Sekou Toure, Sefouraye Diallo, Lansana Beavogui, Ismael Toure, Nfamara Keita, Dianne Lansana, and Mamouna Toure as the new members of the Political Bureau. Sekou Toure was elected as the Secretary General of the Party.

    杜尔总统在几内亚民主党第八次代表大会上
    重申反帝反殖立场决心维护民族独立
    代表大会一致通过向中国致敬和加强几中友好合作关系的动议
    据新华社科纳克里电　几内亚民主党第八次代表大会从九月二十五日到十月二日在科纳克里新落成的“十月二日大会堂”隆重举行。
    几内亚总统、民主党总书记塞古·杜尔在大会上代表全国政治局作了长篇政治报告。他在报告中，重申几内亚反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、维护民族独立的立场。
    他在谈到当前的国际形势时说，在被压迫人民积极进行斗争并在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲取得不可争辩的胜利之后，帝国主义和殖民主义势力向各国人民发动全面进攻。他指出：“国际上流传一种观点，即和平是避免东方和西方、资本主义世界和社会主义世界的冲突。这种观点是错误的，我们加以谴责。”他说：帝国主义正在玩弄和利用“和平共处”，“不能想象，帝国主义会甘心情愿地为自己挖掘坟墓。”他认为，世界进步力量只有团结一致战斗，才能消灭帝国主义。
    在谈到联合国时，杜尔说：“联合国是无能的。”他说，联合国安理会已经“变成大国之间进行交易的真正的阴谋场所”，它“严重地阻碍各国被压迫人民的前进”。杜尔指出，目前的联合国必须进行彻底的改变，而且它所属的一切机构，特别是那些在非洲大陆活动的机构，应当立即进行同样深刻的改变。他还提到，占世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国被专横地剥夺了在联合国的合法权利。
    杜尔总统表示全力支持非洲自由战士为推翻外国统治而进行的斗争。在谈到非洲统一时，他强调说，“非洲统一必须是非洲反帝阵线的统一”。他希望非洲国家从最近的中东事件中吸取教训。
    对国内的经济建设，杜尔特别强调发展几内亚农业的重要性，并指出这是几内亚工业化取得胜利的关键。他强调必须采取自力更生的方针。
    正在几内亚作友好访问的中华人民共和国政府友好代表团团长林海云应邀在大会上讲话，他代表中国政府和中国人民向大会表示热烈的祝贺。他对几内亚人民在几内亚民主党领导下，同帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争中和发展民族经济方面所取得的胜利和成就，表示由衷的高兴。
    林海云团长指出，当前的世界是一片大好形势，非洲形势也是大好。他说：非洲人民反帝革命斗争正在深入发展。非洲人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的伟大潮流，是任何人也阻挡不住的。林海云团长说：目前，中国正在进行着由我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。我们相信，我国人民经过这场文化大革命，将对世界人民的革命事业，做出新的、更大的贡献。林海云团长谈到中几人民之间的友谊时说：中几两国在反帝斗争中，一贯互相同情，互相支持。七亿中国人民决心同几内亚人民一道，高举反帝反殖的旗帜，并肩前进！
    在林海云团长讲话过程中，掌声不断，特别是当提到中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席时，全场长时间热烈鼓掌。讲完后，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。杜尔总统走上前去，热情地与林海云团长拥抱，表示感谢。
    在闭幕式上，大会在经久不息的掌声中，一致通过了向中国致敬和加强几中友好合作关系的动议。动议中说：“在几内亚人民历史的这个庄严时刻，大会向胜利迅速地在最好的情况下建成我们的美丽的‘十月二日大会堂’而作出贡献的中国劳动者致以最热烈的祝贺。大会为我们两国之间的合作的特别积极的成果，特别是在执行几内亚共和国经济和社会发展计划中的特别积极的成果，向中国政府并通过她向全中国人民表示敬意。”动议又说：“大会最后重申几内亚人民愿在各个方面加强并扩大几中两国之间的兄弟般的战斗的合作关系。”
    大会最后选出塞古·杜尔、塞福拉耶·迪亚洛、兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉、伊斯梅尔·杜尔、恩法马拉·凯塔、迪亚内·兰萨纳和马穆纳·杜尔等七人为新的政治局成员。塞古·杜尔被选为民主党总书记。
