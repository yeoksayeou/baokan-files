The British authorities in Hong Kong have been continuously creating tensions and engaging in provocative activities at the Shenzhen border. The Chinese government has lodged a serious protest with the British government.

A responsible official from the Western Europe Division of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires, Hopson, this afternoon to protest against the provocative actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong at the Shenzhen border and to demand that the British government order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately remove the barbed wire from the Man Kam To Bridgehead and the farmland of our peasants, restore normal traffic and order at the border, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

The official from the Western Europe Division stated that in recent times, the British authorities in Hong Kong have been continuously building fortifications in the Shenzhen border area, creating a tense situation. On October 10, the British authorities in Hong Kong secretly set up barbed wire in the middle of our peasants' farmland at night, damaging crops and hindering normal farming activities.

On October 14, the affected peasants crossed the border to negotiate with the relevant British authorities at Man Kam To, demanding the removal of the barbed wire set up on their farmland to avoid hindering farming activities. This demand was entirely reasonable. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong not only refused to accept it but also set up machine guns on the hilltops and dispatched a large number of soldiers, police, and "riot control teams" to surround our peasant groups, making armed threats and provocations. Ultimately, they even drove four armored vehicles recklessly towards our peasant groups, creating a very serious situation. Only because our side's masses adopted a restrained attitude and quickly withdrew to our side did a larger incident not occur.

On October 15, the British authorities in Hong Kong arbitrarily set up barbed wire at the Man Kam To Bridgehead, blocking the passage and obstructing traffic, hindering the production activities of our masses, and further escalating the border situation.

The official from the Western Europe Division finally pointed out that the recent serious incidents at the Shenzhen border were entirely caused by a series of provocative actions by the British authorities in Hong Kong. The provocative actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong seriously threatened the safety of local Chinese residents and infringed upon their traditional rights, which naturally aroused strong indignation among the local masses. For this reason, the Chinese government has lodged a serious protest with the British government. The Chinese government demands that the British government order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately remove the barbed wire from the Man Kam To Bridgehead and the farmland of our peasants, restore normal traffic and order at the border, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

    港英当局不断在深圳边境制造紧张局势进行挑衅活动
    中国政府向英国政府提出严重抗议
    我外交部西欧司负责人在召见英国驻华代办时指出，中国政府要求英国政府责成港英当局立即撤除文锦渡桥头和我农民耕地上的铁丝网，恢复边境上的正常交通和秩序，并保证不再发生类似事件。
    新华社二十日讯　我国外交部西欧司负责人今日下午召见英国驻华代办霍普森，就香港英国当局在深圳边境地区的挑衅行为向英国政府提出严重抗议，并要求英国政府责成香港英国当局立即撤除文锦渡桥头和我农民耕地上的铁丝网，恢复边境上的正常交通和秩序，并且保证不再发生类似事件。
    西欧司负责人说，近一时期，香港英国当局不断在深圳边境一带修建工事，制造紧张局势。十月十日，港英当局乘夜在我农民耕地中间架设铁丝网，破坏农作物，妨害农民正常耕作。
    十月十四日，我受害农民过境，同文锦渡英方有关部门负责人谈判，要求撤除架设在他们耕地上的铁丝网，以免妨碍耕作。这个要求完全是合情合理的。但是，香港英国当局不仅没有接受，反而在山头架起机关枪，并派遣大批军队、警察和“防暴队”，包围我农民群众，进行武装威胁和挑衅，最后，甚至开动四辆装甲车野蛮冲向我农民群众，造成极为严重的局势。只是由于我方群众采取克制态度，迅速撤回我方境内，才避免酿成更大的事件。
    十五日，港英当局又蛮横无理地在文锦渡桥头架设铁丝网，封锁通道，阻碍来往交通，妨害我方群众生产活动，进一步使边境局势处于紧张状态。
    西欧司负责人最后指出，连日以来，深圳边境地区发生的一些严重情况，完全是由于香港英国当局一系列的挑衅行为所造成的。香港英国当局这些挑衅行为，严重地威胁了当地中国居民的安全，侵犯了他们的传统权益，不能不引起当地群众的强烈愤慨。为此，中国政府向英国政府提出严重抗议。中国政府要求英国政府责成香港英国当局立即撤除文锦渡桥头和我农民耕地上的铁丝网，恢复边境上的正常交通和秩序，并且保证不再发生类似事件。
