The winds of the East are prevailing over the West, and songs of praise are rising from all corners of the world. Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of the world are looking up to you! The revolutionary people of the world unanimously acclaim: You are the eternal red sun in our hearts.

"Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, the growth of all things relies on the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Sailors from many countries, after crossing the seas, as soon as they arrive at Chinese ports, eagerly ask the Chinese staff for the shining Mao badges and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This expresses their boundless admiration for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Once their requests are fulfilled, they always excitedly pin the Mao badges or "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on their chests and shout, "Long live Mao Zedong!"

	Most Respected Leader

One day in May, the Italian ship "San Francisco" docked at the port of Zhanjiang. The captain of the ship sought out the staff of the sailors' club to have a heart-to-heart talk. He excitedly said, "I have been to many countries and have been in China for some time. I have personally seen the great achievements of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. China is developing and advancing; it is a remarkable country. Mao Zedong is a great leader." "We greatly miss Mao Zedong."

After saying this, he also told the Chinese staff about an incident: Not long ago, this ship was inspected by an American officer in the Panama Canal. The American officer pointed at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on his bed and asked in confusion, "Why don't you hang a portrait of your wife, but hang Mao Zedong's?" He solemnly replied, "My wife is a member of my family, but Mao Zedong is the most respected leader of the people of the world. Thinking of him gives us strength." This left the American officer speechless.

	Most Blessed Moment

Not long ago, an Italian ship, the "Gippsland," had just anchored at the port when the crew eagerly gathered around the Chinese staff, gazing deeply at the Mao badges on the staff's chests. One young man pointed to the staff's chest and then to his own. The staff understood and pinned their Mao badge on his chest. He stood at attention and respectfully saluted, saying excitedly, "Mao Zedong is great!" "Mao Zedong is magnificent!" "Mao Zedong—Marx." The other crew members also eagerly asked for badges. They enthusiastically said, "Wearing Mao Zedong's badge makes us the happiest." Some, after receiving a Mao badge, also requested more from the staff. He said, "The Mao badge is not only for me; I will also take it back to Italy for my wife and children so they can always see the great Mao Zedong." He also said, "I firmly believe that in the future, all revolutionary people of the world will wear Mao badges."

There was also a Norwegian ship, the "Sprang," which had just unloaded its cargo. A young woman working as a stewardess ran to the customs officer and begged for a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When she received the English version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that she had longed for day and night, she was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes and she said, "I have finally found the precious book I have been longing for day and night. Today is the happiest day of my life." She also said, "I have a sister, and when I left Norway, she repeatedly asked me to find this red treasure for her." The customs officer happily gave her another copy. She joyfully spread the news, and soon the crew members came one after another to ask for the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Even at midnight, the crew of the ship came knocking on the customs office door to ask for the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Everyone gathered in front of the customs office, shouting joyfully, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" The shouts echoed across the port at night.

	Most Beloved Sound

"The loudest song is 'The East Is Red,' and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong." "The sound of Beijing is the most pleasant." The revolutionary people of the world yearn for Beijing and listen to the voice of Beijing.

On June 18 of this year, a Moroccan ship, the "Morocco," slowly entered the port. The crew, with excited hearts, sang "The East Is Red" and "Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman" in various languages as they entered the port of Zhanjiang. Upon inquiry, these crew members loved to sing Chinese revolutionary songs the most and loved to listen to the broadcasts about the Cultural Revolution from the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing. When their radio broke down, several cleaners, assistant stewards, sailors, and service personnel on the ship immediately pooled their hard-earned money to buy a new Chinese-made radio. At night, they sat on the deck around the radio, listening intently to the broadcast of "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts" from the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing. They listened more and more excitedly. When they heard the Red Guards shouting "Long live Chairman Mao," the crew members gathered around, raising their hands and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The shouts echoed over the sea of Zhanjiang. Many crew members also wrote passionate diary entries in their notebooks.

	Most Precious Comrades

"Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." The seamen of the heroic country known as the "towering mountain that reaches the clouds"—Albania—love the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, the most. The brave people of Albania are indeed our most precious comrades.

As soon as they arrived at the port, they said, "We are home again." A short sentence contains so much profound meaning! They often spoke Chinese they had just learned, enthusiastically praising the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, joyfully shouting the glorious achievements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and warmly praising our Red Guards.

Once, Albanian seamen came to the Chinese sailors' club to watch Chinese films and performances by the Red Guards' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. A seaman, in order to see the magnificent image of Chairman Mao and the heroic spirit of the Red Guards more clearly, specially found a seat in the middle near the stage. He pointed to the screen with his finger and then to his eyes, saying in Chinese, "Mao Chairman—close—clear—good." When the screen showed the radiant and ruddy-faced Chairman Mao, they were filled with enthusiasm, stood up and applauded, shouting in Chinese, "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Long live Chairman Mao." Every time they saw the Red Guards in their heroic attire, they praised in unison, "The Chinese Red Guards are great!"

	Most Proud People

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, enjoys the highest prestige in the world. Sailors from various countries and Chinese sailors on long voyages have had extensive contact with the people of various countries. They have personally seen the boundless love of the people of various countries for Chairman Mao. Chinese sailors, whenever they arrive at a port, are always loved and welcomed by the local people. They regard Chinese sailors as the most proud people.

The Chinese sailors on the British ship "Arctic" docked at the port of Zhanjiang said, "The ship has been to many countries in Africa and the Americas, and people of various skin colors have eagerly asked Chinese sailors for Mao badges. After receiving the badges, they shouted 'Mao Zedong' 'Mao Zedong,' envying the Chinese people and reluctant to leave for a long time." He said, "Once the ship sailed to Cuba, an old Cuban worker specially ran from a distant home to the port to ask for a Mao badge. After receiving it, he tightly held the hand of the Chinese sailor and said, 'Mao Chairman is great!' 'Mao Zedong is magnificent!' 'You are the Chinese people—the proud people.' When the ship sailed to other docks in Cuba, many Cubans used their hands to gesture to the Chinese sailors, saying, 'Revisionism is bad,' 'You Chinese are good!'"

Although they did not understand each other's language, the silent language merged into the deepest friendship. The glorious name "Mao Zedong" tightly connected the hearts of Chinese and foreign people.

	Most Firm Belief

"Forever following Mao Zedong, taking the Chinese path, and thoroughly criticizing imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries," this is the firm belief and iron-clad slogan of the awakened revolutionary people of the five continents.

Sailors from Africa and Latin America said, "Mao Zedong is the symbol of victory. He is the greatest and most brilliant commander in opposing imperialism and opposing old and new colonialism. Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and defeating imperialism with people's war illuminates the path to victory for us oppressed people." Sailors from Europe said, "Mao Zedong is the red sun that dispels the mist. Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest weapon to bury revisionism." They said, "The leadership of the CPSU and their accomplices are increasingly exposing their traitorous faces. Their days are numbered." Sailors from the disaster-stricken countries of Indonesia, Japan, Burma, India, and many others firmly said, "Whoever opposes Chairman Mao Zedong, whoever opposes the People's Republic of China, whoever destroys the friendship between us forged in blood, is only dreaming."

Not long ago, a young sailor named Pei Sheng on the British ship "Mutual" told the Chinese staff, "Mao Zedong Thought is not only your strong weapon to defeat domestic and foreign reactionaries but also the only powerful weapon for all people of the world to defeat all enemies." He also said, "I am an Irishman. I hate British imperialism and even more hate American imperialism. I completely believe in Mao Zedong's words, 'All reactionaries are paper tigers.' The poor people of Britain and the poor people of the world can only follow Mao Zedong to liberate themselves."

Sailors from many countries also eagerly told the Chinese staff about the great achievements of their people using armed struggle. They reached a common conclusion: The Jiangang Mountain path is the only path for all revolutionary people of the world.

    大海航行靠舵手
    ——各国海员无限热爱世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席
    叶植辉
    东风万里，四海歌唱。毛主席，全世界革命人民仰望着您！全世界革命人民齐声赞颂：您是我们心中永远不落的红太阳。
    “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。”许多国家的海员飘洋过海，一抵达中国港口，纷纷向我国工作人员索取金光闪闪的毛主席像章和红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，表达了他们对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无比爱戴。一旦自己的要求得到满足，他们总是激动地把毛主席像章或《毛主席语录》贴在胸口，高呼“朗利弗（万岁）毛泽东！”。
      最　敬　爱　的　领　袖
    五月的一天，意大利籍“旧金山”轮在湛江港停泊以后，该船的船长找我海员俱乐部的工作人员谈心。他兴奋地说：“我到过很多国家，我来中国也有一段时间了。我亲眼看到中国人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，取得了巨大的成就。中国在发展，在前进，是一个了不起的国家。毛泽东是一位伟大的领袖。”“我们十分想念毛泽东。”
    说完后，他还向我工作人员讲述了这样一件事：不久以前，这艘轮船在巴拿马运河受美国警官检查。美国警官指着贴在他床头的毛主席像很不理解地问：“你为什么不挂你妻子的像，却挂毛泽东的像？”他严肃地回答：“我的妻子是我家的人，但毛泽东却是全世界人民最敬爱的领袖，想起他，我们就有力量。”说得这个美国警官无言可对。
        最　幸　福　的　时　刻
    不久以前，一艘意大利籍“吉普吉娣”号轮，刚到港口抛锚，船员们就热情地涌到我工作人员面前，深情地凝视着工作人员胸前的毛主席像章。其中一个青年用手指了指工作人员胸前，又指了指自己的胸前。我工作人员会意，把自己的毛主席像章别在他胸前。他恭恭敬敬地立正行了一个民族礼，激动地说：“毛泽东真好！”“毛泽东真伟大”“毛泽东—马克思”。其他船员也纷纷向我工作人员索取。他们热情奔放地说：戴上毛泽东像章，我们最幸福。有的得到了一枚毛主席像章以后，还请求工作人员再给他几枚。他说：“毛主席像章不但我需要，我还要带回意大利给我的妻子和孩子，让他们永远能看见伟大的毛泽东”。他又说：“我坚信，将来全世界的革命人民都会戴上毛主席像章。”
    还有一艘挪威籍的“史品南格”号轮刚卸完货，船上一位当服务生的姑娘跑到海关人员面前恳求送她一本《毛主席语录》。当她得到了一本日日夜夜盼望的英文版《毛主席语录》时，激动得热泪盈眶地说：“我终于寻找到了日思夜想的宝书，今天是我一生中最幸福的日子。”她又说：“我还有一个姐姐，离开挪威时，她千嘱万咐要为她找到这本红宝书”。海关人员又高兴地赠给她一本。她乐得奔走相告，很快把这喜讯传开了。船上的海员陆续跑来索取，深夜十二时多了，该轮的船员还跑来敲门向海关人员索取《毛主席语录》。大家在海关门前尽情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”欢呼声响彻着港口的夜空。
        最　爱　听　的　声　音
    “最响亮的歌是东方红，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东”，“北京的声音最动听”，世界革命人民向往着北京，倾听着北京的声音。
    今年六月十八日，一艘摩洛哥籍的“茅里田尼”轮徐徐驶进港口。船员们怀着激动的心情，用各种语言高唱刚学会的《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》进入了湛江港。一打听，这些船员平日最爱唱中国革命歌曲，最爱收听北京中央人民广播电台关于文化大革命的节目播音。收音机坏了，该轮几个清洁工、副水手长、水手和服务生数人，马上拿出一点一滴地积累下来的血汗钱，又买了一部中国造的新收音机。深夜，他们还坐在甲板上围着收音机，全神贯注地收听北京中央人民广播电台的《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》节目播音。他们越听越激动。当听到红卫兵欢呼“毛主席万岁”时，船员们纷纷围了上来，举起双手高呼：“毛主席万岁！”欢呼声荡漾在湛江海面上。许多船员还在日记本上，挥笔写下了充满激情的日记。
        最　可　贵　的　战　友
      “中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的”。被誉为“耸入云霄的高山”的英雄之国——阿尔巴尼亚的海员们最热爱世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席。英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民不愧是我们最可贵的战友。
    他们一到港口就说：“又回到家了。”简短的一句话，含蓄着多么深刻的意义！他们常常操着刚学会的中国话，热烈赞扬全世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席，尽情欢呼中国文化大革命的辉煌战果，热情地夸奖我们的红卫兵。
    一次，阿尔巴尼亚的海员到中国海员俱乐部看中国电影和红卫兵毛泽东思想宣传队演出。一个海员为了能更清楚地看到毛主席的光辉形象和红卫兵的英雄气概，他特地找了一个靠近舞台的中间位置坐下。他对我工作人员用手指了指银幕，又指了指自己的眼睛，用中国话说：“毛主席——近——清楚——好”。当银幕上出现神采奕奕、红光满面的毛主席时，他们热情迸发，起立鼓掌，用中国话最响亮的高呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”，“毛主席万岁”，每当看见飒爽英姿的红卫兵，他们就齐声称赞：“中国红卫兵好！”
        最　自　豪　的　人
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在全世界享有极崇高的威望。航行在世界各地的外籍和中籍的中国远洋船员，同各国人民进行了广泛的接触。他们亲眼看到了各国人民对毛主席的无限热爱。中籍海员每到一个港口，总是受到当地人民的爱戴和欢迎。他们把中籍海员誉为最自豪的人。
    停泊在湛江港的英籍“北冰洋”轮的中籍海员说：“该轮曾到过非洲、美洲很多国家，各种肤色不同的外国人民都争着向中籍海员索取毛主席像章。得到像章以后，他们就喊‘毛泽东’‘毛泽东’，羡慕地望着中国人，久久舍不得离开”。他说：“有一次该轮航行到古巴，一位古巴老工人特地从很远的家跑到港口要毛主席像章。得到以后，紧握住中籍海员的手说：‘毛主席真好！’‘毛泽东伟大！’‘你们是中国人民——自豪的人’”。该轮到古巴其他码头，很多古巴人用双手比划着对中国海员说：“修正主义——坏”，“你们中国好！”
    尽管他们之间的语言不通，但无声的语言却汇成最深厚的友情。“毛泽东”这个光辉的名字把中外人民的心紧紧相连。
        最　坚　定　的　信　念
      “永远跟着毛泽东，走中国的道路，大造帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反”，这是觉醒了的五大洲革命人民的坚定信念和钢铁般的口号。
    来自非洲和拉丁美洲的海员说：“毛泽东是胜利的象征，他是反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义最伟大、最天才的指挥者。毛主席的‘枪杆子里面出政权’，用人民战争打败帝国主义的光辉思想，照亮了我们被压迫人民走向胜利的道路。”来自欧洲的海员说：“毛泽东是驱散妖雾的红太阳，毛泽东思想是埋葬修正主义最强大的武器。”他们说：“苏共领导集团及其同伙，正在越来越暴露他们叛徒的嘴脸。他们的日子不长了。”来自多灾多难的印度尼西亚、日本、缅甸、印度等国的广大海员坚定地说：“谁反对毛泽东主席，谁反对人民中国，谁破坏我们之间用血肉凝成的友谊，那只不过是梦想。”
    不久以前，一艘英籍的“垂互立尔”号轮一位叫培声的青年水手，对中国工作人员说：“毛泽东思想不但是你们战胜国内外反动派的坚强武器，也是全世界人民战胜一切敌人的唯一强大的武器”。他又说：“我是爱尔兰人，我憎恨英帝国主义，更憎恨美帝国主义，我完全相信毛泽东的话，‘一切反动派都是纸老虎’。我们英国的穷人和世界上的穷人，只有跟着毛泽东，才能解放。”
    许多国家的海员还纷纷向中国工作人员讲述他们的人民运用武装斗争取得的伟大成就。他们得出一个共同的结论就是，井冈山的道路是全世界革命人民唯一的道路。
