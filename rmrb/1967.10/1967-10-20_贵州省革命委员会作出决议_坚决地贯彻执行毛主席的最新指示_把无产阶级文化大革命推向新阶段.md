The fourth plenary session of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held a meeting and issued a resolution on resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions to advance the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province to a new stage.

The resolution states: Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions are the most brilliant, the most correct, and the most timely, fully in line with the actual situation in Guizhou. Resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions is the overriding task at the moment, the most important task. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must immediately convey Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions to workers, commune members, cadres, students, and family members, ensuring that everyone knows them. A widespread and in-depth campaign to study and propagate Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions must be launched throughout the province.

The resolution states: The standing committee of the provincial revolutionary committee must take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's instructions, go to the front lines of struggle, and together with the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, seriously study, repeatedly propagate, and deeply understand them. Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions must be strictly followed, word for word and letter for letter. All levels of revolutionary committees must hold special meetings, allocate sufficient time, use Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions as a weapon, combine them with actual conditions, seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of the movement, and formulate practical and feasible specific measures based on the actual situation of the region and unit. This will ensure that Chairman Mao's instructions are implemented item by item, sentence by sentence, and letter by letter, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advancing the Cultural Revolution to a new stage. At the same time, we must strive even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learning and applying them in the struggle; achieving new levels of learning and application, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, drive everything, and transform everything, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and promoting the thought revolution of the people.

The resolution requires: Resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism," and running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Using the four characters "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism" as the guiding principle, strengthen the ideological education of cadres and Red Guards.

The resolution states: To carry out a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of various schools and units, from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every battlefield.

The resolution calls for: On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity. All factories, schools, departments, and enterprises must resolutely implement the notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on achieving revolutionary great unity according to the system. Strengthen the education of cadres, release a batch of cadres, and better implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to solve our internal contradictions, expand the scope of education, and narrow the scope of attack. The resolution also made arrangements for work in various aspects such as seizing the revolution and promoting production, saving money for the revolution; relying on the masses, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat; carrying out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people more deeply and persistently; and strengthening the construction of revolutionary committees.
