The Vietnamese Party and Government Delegation, led by Vice-Chairman Huong Van Huan and other delegation members, visited the Beijing Clock and Watch Factory this morning. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory shouted slogans such as "Defeat the U.S. imperialists! Victory to Vietnam!" "Long live Chairman Hu!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and warmly welcomed their Vietnamese comrades from the front lines of the anti-U.S. struggle.

The responsible person from the factory's revolutionary committee introduced to the Vietnamese comrades how the revolutionary workers of the entire factory are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on revolution, and vigorously promoting production. Huong Van Huan wished the workers of the Beijing Clock and Watch Factory greater victories in their revolutionary and production efforts and greater achievements in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revise and Criticize Revisionism."

The delegation toured the factory's workshops and the new products created by the workers during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the tour, the factory's revolutionary committee presented to the Vietnamese comrades a newly made long plastic alarm clock, which the workers had rushed to produce overnight. This new alarm clock features a side portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and a quote from Chairman Mao: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." It also has the slogans: "The fighting friendship between China and Vietnam is unbreakable!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Vietnamese Democratic Republic Party and Government Delegation, led by Vice-Chairman Huong Van Huan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic, and other delegation members, visited Beijing Geological Institute this morning, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. They were warmly welcomed by thousands of revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards.

At the welcoming rally, filled with the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam, Huong Van Huan introduced the glorious victories achieved by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh in their struggle against U.S. aggression. He said that the Vietnamese people are determined to fight the U.S. imperialists to the end and will not rest until they drive the U.S. out of Vietnam. In his speech, Huong Van Huan praised the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao and wished for the everlasting fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.

During the rally, the revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards continuously shouted slogans such as: "Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people!" "Seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!"

This morning, when the Vietnamese comrades arrived at Beijing Geological Institute, thousands of revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang revolutionary songs of China and Vietnam, warmly welcoming their close Vietnamese comrades.
