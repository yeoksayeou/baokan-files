Revolutionary cadres across the nation are greatly inspired by studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions

Many revolutionary cadres excitedly said: Chairman Mao pays the most attention to educating cadres politically and ideologically, caring for cadres, and cherishing cadres. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and must definitely take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key task, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, more consciously accept tests and tempering.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Revolutionary cadres across the country, with deep feelings of love for our great leader Chairman Mao, are earnestly studying the editorial "Correctly Implementing Chairman Mao's Policy on Cadres" published in People's Daily. They said that this important editorial, which is radiant with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, embodies the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's boundless concern, high trust, and earnest expectations for revolutionary cadres across the country. It conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. They expressed that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions and consistent teachings, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and be with the masses, "working wholeheartedly for the nation, the class, and the Party." They will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will achieve new merits for the people and shoulder the responsibilities of the Chinese and world revolution.

Under the personal initiation and leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary cadres across the country have undergone severe tests, received great tempering and reform. Many revolutionary cadres said excitedly: Chairman Mao pays the most attention to educating cadres politically and ideologically, caring for cadres, and cherishing cadres. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and must definitely take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key task, and in the Cultural Revolution, more consciously accept tests and tempering. Our cadre team must be built into a team that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, maintains and carries forward the glorious traditions of our Party, is revolutionary, and is full of vigor.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many revolutionary cadres have always followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and achieved new merits in the struggle to smash the bourgeois headquarters within the Party. After studying the editorial of People's Daily, they expressed that they will definitely hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn better from revolutionary masses, learn better from revolutionary youngsters, and at the same time, use the revolutionary principles of Mao Zedong Thought to enthusiastically help revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters, fight together with them, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Cadres across various places emphasized that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, correctly handle themselves, correctly handle mass movements, and especially correctly handle criticisms from revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters. Revolutionary cadres in Beijing pointed out that whether one can correctly handle mass movements is the dividing line between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois revolutionaries; whether one can correctly handle criticisms from revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters is also an important sign of whether a cadre truly stands on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Revolutionary cadres in Shanghai deeply felt that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best crucible for tempering and reforming cadres. The vice chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of East China Normal University and the former first secretary of the school's Party Committee, Yao Li, said, "In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, because I had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, I was criticized by revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters, which was the greatest education and rescue for me. They are my good teachers. They are so resolute in wanting our Party and country not to change color and in uprooting the roots of revisionism! Thinking of this, I am deeply grateful to them from the bottom of my heart."

Revolutionary cadres in the Guiyang region, who are currently studying in Mao Zedong Thought classes, also talked about their experiences in handling mass movements. They pointed out that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there has always been a struggle between two classes and two worldviews in handling mass movements. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communist Party members should face the wind and rain and see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of mass struggles, and this world is the great world of mass struggles." We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take criticisms from the masses as good opportunities for education, take revolutionary masses as good teachers, and consciously go to mass struggles to accept tests.

Revolutionary leading cadres in some factories in Harbin said with deep feelings that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has rung the alarm for us; the great wind and rain of mass movements have washed away the dust in our souls. They expressed that in the future, they will definitely go better to the masses, consciously accept the supervision of the masses.

Former vice secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee and mayor of Hangzhou, Wang Zida, excitedly said, "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been a severe test for the cadre team. Our mistakes, if not for the fire of mass movements, would not have been burned away. The masses are the real heroes. Being able to participate in this unprecedented Cultural Revolution and undergo tests is the greatest happiness. He said, "The revolutionary burden we must carry, not fearing responsibility, not fearing mistakes, using Mao Zedong Thought to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, fight to old age, criticize to old age, to maintain revolutionary integrity."

Many cadres in various places, while studying the editorial of People's Daily, deeply felt that as a revolutionary cadre, one must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be both an 'official' and a common person." One must put down one's airs, treat the masses with an equal attitude, maintain close contact with the masses, and do a good job of the relationship between cadres and the masses, so as to forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness and vigor, and keep moving forward.

Some revolutionary leading cadres participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Changsha expressed that in the future, they will always remember that they are ordinary laborers, consult with the masses on every matter, be students of the masses, and always blend in with the masses. Revolutionary cadres in Xining, Wuhan, and Tianjin, who have already participated in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs of their units, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, with the spirit of being willing to be students, put down their airs, walk out of their offices, go deep into the masses, and humbly learn from revolutionary masses and revolutionary youngsters. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to solve the problem of superior-subordinate relationships well and do a good job of the relationship between cadres and the masses. We will definitely carry it out. We will definitely go deep into the masses, constantly reform ourselves, and truly serve the people wholeheartedly, not for a moment leaving the masses." Recently, many revolutionary cadres in Nanchang have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues and have taken the attitude of being willing to be students, going with the masses to the front lines of revolution and production.

After studying Chairman Mao's important instructions on cadre issues and the editorial of People's Daily, revolutionary cadres across the country have even more ardently loved our great leader Chairman Mao. They shouted loudly a thousand times and ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" They expressed: They will definitely follow Chairman Mao for life, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, study to old age, change to old age, follow to old age, and carry the proletarian revolutionary cause through to the end, and be a person who benefits the people for life. Revolutionary cadres in many places such as Jinan, Chengdu, Yinchuan, Xi'an, Anshan, Zhengzhou, and Hefei all expressed that in the future, they will definitely put the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and earlier than everything. The leading members of the recently established Revolutionary Committee of Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, unanimously expressed: They will not disappoint Chairman Mao's earnest expectations, definitely take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key task, fiercely fight against the selfishness in their minds, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, "completely selfless and dedicated to the people," thoroughly and completely serve the people, forever be good students of Chairman Mao, and forever be faithful servants of the people. The chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory and revolutionary leading cadre, Luo Fengqi, said, "In the future, we will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and in the common struggle with the masses, improve the consciousness of socialist revolution, deepen the understanding of Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on carrying out revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and in the great waves of class struggle, follow the great commander Chairman Mao to victory!"

Revolutionary cadres across the country have deeply felt the heavy responsibility of revolutionary cadres from our great leader Chairman Mao's earnest expectations for them. They firmly expressed that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, together with the broad revolutionary masses, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a thorough victory, and shoulder the responsibilities of the Chinese and world revolution.

    全国广大革命干部学习毛主席最新指示受到巨大鼓舞
    永远忠于毛主席，做人民的忠实勤务员
    许多革命干部激动地说：毛主席最注意从政治上思想上教育干部，关心干部，爱护干部。我们决不能辜负毛主席的期望，一定要以斗私批修为纲，在文化大革命中更加自觉地接受考验和锻炼。
    新华社二十二日讯　全国各地广大革命干部，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，认真学习《人民日报》社论《正确地执行毛主席的干部政策》，从中受到了极大的鼓舞。他们说，《人民日报》这篇闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的重要社论，体现了伟大领袖毛主席和党中央对全国广大革命干部的无限关怀、高度信任和殷切期望，传达了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示。他们表示，一定要遵照毛主席的最新指示和一贯教导，相信群众，依靠群众，和群众在一起，“忠心耿耿地为民族、为阶级、为党而工作”，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中为人民立新功，肩负起中国革命和世界革命的重任。
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，全国各地广大革命干部经受了严峻的考验，得到了极大的锻炼和改造。许多革命干部非常激动地说：毛主席最注意从政治上、思想上教育干部，关心干部，爱护干部。我们决不能辜负毛主席的期望，一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，在文化大革命中更加自觉地接受考验和锻炼。我们的干部队伍，一定要建设成为一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、保持和发扬我党光荣传统的、革命化的、充满朝气的干部队伍。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，许多革命干部始终紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在摧毁党内资产阶级司令部的斗争中立下了新功。他们学习了《人民日报》社论以后表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地向革命群众学习，更好地向革命小将学习，同时要用毛泽东思想的革命原则，热情地帮助革命群众和革命小将，同他们战斗在一起，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底的胜利。
    各地广大革命干部着重表示，一定要按照毛主席的一贯教导，正确地对待自己，正确地对待群众运动，特别要正确地对待革命群众和革命小将对自己的批评。北京市的许多革命干部指出，能不能正确地对待群众运动，是区别无产阶级革命家和资产阶级革命家的分水岭；能不能正确地对待革命群众和革命小将的批评，也是区别干部是不是真正站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的一个重要标志。
    上海广大革命干部深深体会到，无产阶级文化大革命是锻炼和改造干部的最好熔炉。上海华东师范大学革命委员会副主任、原学校党委第一书记姚力说，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，由于我执行过资产阶级反动路线，受到革命群众和革命小将们的批判，这是对我最大的教育和挽救。他们是我的好教员。他们正是为了使我们党和国家不改变颜色，对挖掉修正主义根子是那样的坚决！想到这一点，我就从心底里感激他们。
    正在毛泽东思想学习班学习的贵阳地区的广大革命干部，也纷纷谈到了应该怎样对待群众运动的体会。他们指出，在无产阶级文化大革命中，在对待群众运动的问题上，一直存在着两个阶级、两种世界观的斗争。毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，把群众对自己的批判当作受教育的好机会，把革命群众当作良师益友，自觉地到群众斗争中去接受考验。
    哈尔滨市一些工厂的革命领导干部深有体会地说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，给我们敲起了警钟；群众运动的大风雨，洗刷了我们灵魂深处的灰尘。他们表示，今后一定要更好地到群众中去，自觉地接受群众的监督。
    原杭州市委副书记、杭州市市长王子达激动地说，这次无产阶级文化大革命运动，对干部队伍是一次严峻的考验。我们身上的错误，如果没有群众运动的烈火，是烧不掉的。群众是真正的英雄。我们能够参加这场史无前例的文化大革命，经受考验，是最大的幸福。他说，革命的担子我们一定要挑起来，不怕负责任，不怕犯错误，要用毛泽东思想斗私批修，斗到老，批到老，要保持革命的晚节。
    许多地方的革命干部在学习《人民日报》社论时，联系自己的切身经历，深刻地体会到作为一个革命干部，必须时刻牢记毛主席的教导：“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”要放下架子，以平等的态度对待群众，和群众保持密切联系，搞好干部和群众的关系，这样才能永葆革命青春，朝气勃勃，不断前进。
    正在长沙参加湖南省毛泽东思想学习班学习的一些革命领导干部表示，今后一定要时刻想到自己是一个普通劳动者，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生，永远同群众打成一片。西宁、武汉和天津一些已经参加了本单位“三结合”临时权力机构的革命干部，遵照毛主席的教导，以甘当小学生的精神，放下架子，走出办公室，深入到群众中去，虚心向革命群众和革命小将学习。他们说，毛主席教导我们要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。我们坚决照办，我们一定要深入到群众中去，不断改造自己，真正做到全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众。南昌市许多革命干部最近认真地学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，纷纷以甘当小学生的姿态，和群众一起，走上了革命和生产的第一线。
    各地广大革命干部学习了毛主席最近关于干部问题的重要指示和《人民日报》社论以后，更加激发了对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。他们千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们表示：一定要一辈子紧跟毛主席，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，做到老，学到老，改到老，跟到老，把无产阶级革命事业进行到底，作一个一辈子有益于人民的人。济南、成都、银川、西安、鞍山、郑州、合肥等许多地方的革命干部都表示，今后一定要把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，重于一切，先于一切的地位。前几天刚刚成立的内蒙古自治区呼和浩特市革命委员会的领导成员一致表示：决不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，一定以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗自己头脑中的私字，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，“毫不利己专门利人”，完全彻底地为人民服务，永远做毛主席的好学生，永远做人民的忠实勤务员。太原重型机器厂革命委员会主任、革命领导干部罗枫奇说，我们今后一定要更加刻苦地学习毛主席著作，加强无产阶级党性，在与群众的共同斗争中提高社会主义革命的自觉性，加深对毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的理解，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席胜利前进！
    各地广大革命干部从我们伟大领袖毛主席对革命干部的殷切期望中，更加体会到了革命干部的责任重大。他们坚定地表示，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同广大革命群众一起，把无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行到底，肩负起中国革命和世界革命的重担。
