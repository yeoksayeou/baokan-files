China-assisted warehouse in Kathmandu completed

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, September 27th: King Mahendra of Nepal presided over the completion ceremony of the warehouse in Kathmandu, assisted by China, and personally cut the ribbon. Attending the ceremony were Queen Ratna of Nepal, Prime Minister Suriya Bahadur Thapa, senior and deputy ministers, and members of the National Assembly. Li Zhonghe, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy, and Chinese experts also attended the completion ceremony. Also present were about five hundred Nepalese workers and people from various walks of life.

	Nepal's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Gunjishwari Prasad Singh, spoke at the ceremony, saying, "This warehouse, built with the help of China, is a symbol of the development of Nepal-China friendship. Neighboring China has always been concerned about Nepal's economic development." Li Zhonghe, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy, and the representative of Chinese experts also spoke at the ceremony.

	The successful completion of the Kathmandu warehouse is the result of the close cooperation and joint efforts between Chinese experts, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the hardworking Nepalese people. It is a crystallization of the friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal.

	Chinese workers and technicians, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, have shown internationalism in their work, overcoming difficulties and hardships, and selflessly imparting their skills to Nepalese workers. They have established deep friendships. In July of this year, when a group of Chinese experts returned to China, Nepalese workers came from far away to see them off, warmly wishing long life to the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao!

    尼泊尔工商国务大臣贡吉斯瓦里·普拉萨德·辛格在仪式上讲话说，“中国帮助建设的这一仓库是尼中友谊发展的象征。邻邦中国一直热心关怀尼泊尔的经济发展。”中国大使馆临时代办李中和和中国专家代表也在仪式上讲了话。
    加德满都仓库胜利完工，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国专家和勤劳的尼泊尔人民之间紧密合作和共同努力的结果，是中尼两国人民友谊的结晶。
    中国工人和技术人员遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在工作中发扬国际主义精神，不怕艰难困苦，毫无保留地把技术传授给尼泊尔工人。他们之间建立了深厚友谊。今年七月，一批中国专家回国时，尼泊尔工人从很远地方赶来送行，热情祝愿世界人民伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
