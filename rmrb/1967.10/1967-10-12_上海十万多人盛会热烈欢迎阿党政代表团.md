	Shanghai Welcomes Albanian Party and Government Delegation with Grand Rally

	Zhang Chunqiao delivers welcome speech. Kang Sheng and Xie Hu deliver passionate and friendly remarks. Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Yao Wenyuan, and others attend the rally.

	Kang Sheng emphasized that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique and their loyal lackeys are planning to use the name of celebrating the October Revolution to convene a counter-revolutionary black meeting against China, Albania, and Marxism-Leninism. This is the most shameless desecration of the October Revolution and the great Lenin. He said, the traitors of the October Revolution oppose us, which precisely proves that we have inherited the glorious tradition of the October Revolution and the great cause of Lenin.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 11th—Today morning, over 100,000 revolutionary cadres, soldiers, and masses from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses held a grand rally at People's Square to express their most solemn, most enthusiastic, and most sincere welcome to the honorable envoys of the Albanian people, who stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle—the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Xie Hu.

	Today, the center of the city, People's Square, was filled with revolutionary camaraderie between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania. The central stage was adorned with giant portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people and our close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as the national flags of the two countries. The square was adorned with red flags and banners of welcome. The deafening sound of drums, passionate slogans, and heroic revolutionary songs merged into one, echoing through the sky and shaking the air above the Huangpu River.

	Central leaders and relevant officials such as Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Liu Xiao, Luo Guibao, and others, who accompanied the Albanian comrades on their visit to Shanghai, attended the welcoming rally. Responsible comrades from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, leaders of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, and responsible comrades from various revolutionary mass organizations also attended the rally.

	Around 9 AM, Comrade Xie Hu, Comrade Alia, and the entire Albanian Party and Government Delegation, accompanied by Comrades Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Liu Ningyi, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan, ascended the stage. At this moment, the entire audience erupted in thunderous cheers and slogans. People waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting "Mao Zedong—Enver" and "Enver—Mao Zedong" for a long time. The rally began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red," and the entire audience recited quotations from Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha in unison.

	Today's welcoming rally was presided over by Comrade Yao Wenyuan.

	Comrade Zhang Chunqiao delivered a welcome speech at the rally. He, on behalf of the 10 million people of Shanghai and the broad masses of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, expressed the highest respect and warmest welcome to the envoys of the heroic people from the Adriatic coast, our close comrades-in-arms.

	Comrades Kang Sheng and Xie Hu delivered speeches at the rally.

	In his speech (full text on page 4), Comrade Kang Sheng enthusiastically praised the friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania. He said, the friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania have withstood the test of storms and are unbreakable and eternal. Our friendship is a model of the relationship between fraternal parties, fraternal countries, and fraternal peoples. The continuous strengthening of the friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania is of great significance in promoting the development of Marxist-Leninist forces in various countries and achieving greater victories in the international proletarian revolutionary cause and the world people's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle.

	He said, the Albanian Party of Labor is a truly Marxist-Leninist party that has been tested by time, and the Albanian people are a great and upright people. Led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian Party of Labor has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to their revolutionary practice, leading the Albanian people with proletarian heroism to break through countless difficulties and obstacles, achieving one victory after another. Your fearless, indomitable, and daring spirit to fight against all brutal enemies in the world has earned the admiration of the proletariat and revolutionary people worldwide. With great heroism, you have fought head-on against the threats of imperialism and its lackeys, setting a brilliant example for all Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary people around the world. You have deeply exposed and criticized modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, firmly supporting Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in various countries, and have established historic merits in defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

	Comrade Kang Sheng emphasized that Albania's revolutionary movement has enriched the experience of the international proletarian dictatorship. This is a vivid manifestation of the Albanian Party of Labor, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to their revolutionary practice.

	Comrade Kang Sheng said that Comrade Enver Hoxha, at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front, issued a stern warning to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Greek fascist authorities. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people firmly support Comrade Enver Hoxha's solemn declaration. If anyone dares to invade our closest ally, Albania, the 700 million Chinese people will be the strong backing of the Albanian people.

	Comrade Kang Sheng said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. The situation across the country is excellent, better than ever before. The headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev has been thoroughly defeated and is in complete disarray. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of our country has never been as vigorous as it is today, the various ethnic groups of our country have never been as closely united as they are today, and the proletarian dictatorship of our country has never been as solid as it is today. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a common victory of the two parties of China and Albania and all Marxist-Leninists around the world.

	He said, under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our people across the country must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "criticize and repudiate revisionism," and strive for new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Comrade Kang Sheng said, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique and their loyal lackeys have been plotting to convene a counter-revolutionary black meeting against China, Albania, and Marxism-Leninism. Now, these traitors of the October Revolution are trying to use the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to cover up their traitorous faces of surrendering to U.S. imperialism and betraying the world's revolutionary people. They are also planning to use the name of celebrating the October Revolution to convene a counter-revolutionary black meeting. This is the most shameless desecration of the October Revolution and the great Lenin. The traitors of the October Revolution oppose us, which precisely proves that we have inherited the glorious tradition of the October Revolution and the great cause of Lenin.

	Comrade Xie Hu delivered a speech in the midst of enthusiastic applause (full text on page 3). He first conveyed the most enthusiastic revolutionary greetings from the Albanian people, the Albanian Party of Labor, and Comrade Hoxha to the revolutionary cadres of Shanghai, the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao. He enthusiastically praised the deep friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania. He said, our friendship has withstood all tests and storms. This friendship is not limited by geographical distance, and no force in the world can destroy even a bit of this great friendship.

	Comrade Xie Hu gave a high evaluation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China. He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved extraordinarily great victories. These victories not only have historical significance for the People's Republic of China but also have historical significance for the entire international communist movement and all oppressed nations in the world. He said, the Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian people have always supported and will continue to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	In his speech, Comrade Xie Hu introduced the situation of further implementing comprehensive revolutionization in Albania. He said, the movement for further comprehensive revolutionization of our country's life is surging forward unstoppably, and this development process is proceeding on the correct, Marxist-Leninist path. Our revolution has never stopped and will never stop.

	The speeches by Comrades Kang Sheng and Xie Hu repeatedly triggered thunderous applause, and the entire audience enthusiastically shouted, "Salute to the heroic Albanian people!" "Long live the great friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Hoxha!" After Comrade Xie Hu's speech, the two countries' comrades exchanged banners.

	Comrade Xie Hu, on behalf of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, presented a banner with the words "Long live the eternal friendship between Albania and China!" to the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, on behalf of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, presented a banner with the words "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe" to the Albanian comrades. Then, Comrades Xie Hu, Alia, and others shook hands and embraced Comrades Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and others warmly. At this moment, the sound of drums shook the sky, and the cheers and slogans echoed for a long time.

	The welcoming rally ended with the solemn melody of "The Internationale." (Accompanied by a picture)

　　上海十万多人盛会热烈欢迎阿党政代表团
　　张春桥同志致欢迎词。康生谢胡同志发表热情友好的讲话。李富春刘宁一姚文元等同志出席大会
    康生同志强调指出，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团和它的忠实走卒，打算假借庆祝十月革命的名义来筹划召开反华、反阿尔巴尼亚、反马列主义的反革命黑会，这是最无耻地糟踏十月革命，糟踏伟大的列宁。他说，十月革命的叛徒们反对我们，恰恰证明我们继承了十月革命的光荣传统和伟大列宁的事业。
    据新华社上海十一日电　今天上午，上海无产阶级革命派、中国人民解放军驻沪三军广大指战员、红卫兵小将、革命群众十万多人，满怀兄弟般的深厚情谊，在人民广场举行盛大集会，最隆重、最热烈、最诚挚地欢迎站在反帝反修斗争前列的阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣使者——由谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团。
    今天，市中心的人民广场洋溢着中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间革命的战斗友谊。主席台中央高挂着我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志的巨幅画像，以及中阿两国国旗。广场上红旗飘扬，欢迎的横幅挂满四周。喧天的锣鼓声，激昂的口号声和雄壮的革命歌声汇成一片，响彻云霄，震荡黄浦江上空。
    陪同阿尔巴尼亚战友前来上海访问的中央负责同志以及中央各有关方面负责人康生、李富春、刘宁一、刘晓、罗贵波等同志出席了欢迎大会。上海市革命委员会负责人、中国人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军负责人张春桥、姚文元、廖政国、饶守坤、周建平、王少庸、马天水等同志以及各革命群众组织负责人也出席了大会。
    上午九时许，谢胡同志、阿利雅同志以及阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，由康生、李富春、刘宁一和张春桥、姚文元等同志陪同登上主席台。这时全场爆发出震天动地的欢呼声、口号声。人们挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，长时间高呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”。大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的雄壮乐曲声中开始，全场齐声朗读毛主席语录和恩维尔·霍查同志语录。
    今天的欢迎大会由姚文元同志主持。
    张春桥同志在大会上致欢迎词。他代表上海一千万人民和中国人民解放军驻沪部队广大指战员，对来自亚得里亚海畔的英雄人民的使者，我们的亲密战友，表示最崇高的敬意和最热烈的欢迎。
    康生同志和谢胡同志在大会上发表了讲话。
    康生同志在讲话（全文见第四版）中热情称颂中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的友谊和团结。他说，中阿两党、两国和两国人民的友谊和团结，是经过急风暴雨考验的，是牢不可破的，是永恒的。我们之间的友谊，是兄弟党、兄弟国家、兄弟人民之间关系的典范。中阿两党、两国和两国人民的友谊和团结的不断加强，对于促进世界各国马克思列宁主义力量的发展，争取国际无产阶级革命事业和世界人民反帝反修斗争的更大胜利，具有极其重大的意义。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是久经考验的真正的马克思列宁主义的党，阿尔巴尼亚人民是顶天立地的伟大的人民。以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于本国的革命实践，领导着阿尔巴尼亚人民，以无产阶级的英雄气概，冲破了无数艰难险阻，取得了一个又一个的胜利。你们这种吓不倒、压不垮、敢于同世界上一切残暴敌人作斗争的革命大无畏精神，获得了全世界无产阶级和革命人民的敬佩。你们以大无畏的英雄气概，同帝国主义及其走狗的威胁进行了针锋相对的斗争，为全世界马克思列宁主义政党和革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。你们深刻地揭露和批判了以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，坚决支持各国马克思列宁主义政党和组织，为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，建立了历史性的功勋。
    康生同志强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动，丰富了国际无产阶级专政的经验。这是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用于本国革命实践的生动表现。
    康生同志说，恩维尔·霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上，对美帝、苏修和希腊法西斯当局提出了严厉的警告。中国共产党和中国人民坚决支持恩维尔·霍查同志的严正声明。如果谁胆敢侵犯我国最亲密的盟友阿尔巴尼亚，七亿中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。
    康生同志说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。全国的形势大好，比过去任何时候都好。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部被打得落花流水，全面崩溃。我国广大人民的革命精神从来没有象今天这样奋发昂扬，我国各族人民从来没有象今天这样亲密团结，我国的无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，也是中阿两党和全世界马克思列宁主义者的共同胜利。
    他说，在无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好的形势下，我们全国人民要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“斗私，批修”，争取无产阶级文化大革命的新的胜利。
    康生同志说，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团和它的忠实走卒，一直在策划召开反华、反阿尔巴尼亚、反马克思列宁主义的反革命黑会。现在，这些十月革命的叛徒，竟企图利用庆祝十月革命五十周年，来掩盖他们投降美帝国主义、出卖世界人民革命的叛徒面目，并且打算假借庆祝十月革命的名义，来筹划召开反革命黑会。这是最无耻地糟踏十月革命，糟踏伟大的列宁。十月革命的叛徒们反对我们，恰恰证明我们继承了十月革命的光荣传统，继承了伟大列宁的事业。
    谢胡同志在热烈的掌声中讲话（全文见第三版）。他首先向上海无产阶级革命派，向中国人民，向中国共产党和毛主席转达阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志最热烈的革命敬意。他热情地称颂中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的深厚友谊。他说，我们的友谊经历过一切考验和急风暴雨。这个友谊没有地理的距离，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这个伟大友谊的一分一毫。
    谢胡同志对中国正在开展的无产阶级文化大革命给予极高的评价。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了异常巨大的胜利，这些胜利不仅对人民中国具有历史意义，而且对于整个的国际共产主义运动和世界所有的被压迫民族同样具有历史性的意义。他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，并将支持到底。
    谢胡同志在讲话中介绍了阿尔巴尼亚国内正在进一步实现全面革命化的情况。他说，我们国家生活的进一步全面革命化的运动正在势不可挡地蓬勃开展，这个发展进程是在正确的、马克思列宁主义的道路上进行，我国的革命从没有停顿过，也永远不会停顿。
    康生同志和谢胡同志的讲话，不断激起雷鸣般的掌声，全场革命群众热烈高呼：“向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬！”“中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的伟大友谊和战斗团结万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“霍查同志万岁！”谢胡同志讲话后，中阿两国战友互赠锦旗。
　　谢胡同志代表阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团把一面用阿文写着“永恒的阿中友谊万岁！”的锦旗赠送给上海市革命委员会。张春桥同志代表上海市革命委员会向阿尔巴尼亚战友赠送了写着“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”的锦旗。接着，谢胡、阿利雅等同志同康生、李富春、张春桥、姚文元等同志热烈握手、亲切拥抱。这时，全场锣鼓声震天，欢呼声、口号声久久不息。
    欢迎大会在庄严的《国际歌》乐曲中结束。（附图片）
