In the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, the most red sun, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, has his hometown in Xiangtan County, Shao Shan. Today, red flags are flying, songs are ringing, and there is a festive atmosphere. The amateur art troupe from Tirana, Albania, who carry a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, spent an unforgettable day here.

Today, the mountains surrounding Shao Shan are under a clear blue sky. Over a thousand revolutionary masses and local military personnel, holding high the portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, gathered in front of the Shao Shan Guesthouse and along the roadsides, shouting slogans, beating drums, and enthusiastically welcoming the close comrades from the "Land of Eagles."

A few days ago, our great leader Chairman Mao received the members of the art troupe in Beijing. Today, they personally came to visit Chairman Mao's hometown, and everyone's heart was filled with excitement. Even on the way to Shao Shan, the guests repeatedly sang songs like "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with great anticipation for the place where the red sun rises.

Upon arriving in Shao Shan, the members of the art troupe eagerly walked towards Chairman Mao's former residence. In front of the residence, Albanian comrades waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and led the crowd in shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" They also sang Chinese songs like "On the Hills of Beijing" with Chinese comrades. Many Albanian comrades spontaneously gathered together, capturing the most precious moments here. A farmer from the agricultural cooperative and folk artist, Jetevi Cenoli, was deeply moved and said, "The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, not only leads the workers and peasants of China in their struggle but also guides the world's revolutionary people onto the correct revolutionary path. Now, Chinese and world revolutionary people are advancing to victory under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the entire world!"

In the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence, the Albanian comrades learned that six members of Chairman Mao's family had sacrificed their precious lives for the revolution. They were all deeply moved. Some comrades even wrote down the names of these six martyrs in their notebooks. The director of the Skodra Youth Palace, Anjelin Kumuria, said, "I have heard many stories about Chairman Mao's glorious deeds in his youth. Through this visit, I have seen it all with my own eyes. In the future, it will be more helpful for me to explain Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities in his youth." He felt that today was the most meaningful day and expressed his determination to use Chairman Mao's revolutionary deeds to better educate the younger generation of Albanian people. The leader of the art troupe, Mu. Gjerchali, was deeply moved and said, "Our visit to Chairman Mao's hometown is a great happiness and an unforgettable event in our lives. The Chinese people, the Albanian people, and the revolutionary people of the world all feel proud to have Chairman Mao."

In Shao Shan, the peoples of China and Albania fully expressed their deep fraternal and combat-friendly feelings, engaging in cordial conversations and exchanging souvenirs. An Albanian friend told the Chinese comrades, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world." Another friend wrote in the Chinese comrades' notebook: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and his brilliant thoughts guide the people of the world to victory!" When a revolutionary cadre introduced the situation of the Cultural Revolution to the guests, the leader of the art troupe, Mu. Gjerchali, expressed great admiration for the Chinese revolutionary workers and peasants who are determined to defend Mao Zedong Thought. He hoped that the Chinese revolutionary proletariat would fight to the end to overthrow imperialism and modern revisionism and carry the Cultural Revolution to completion.

Today, the Albanian amateur cultural warriors also performed for the Shao Shan military and civilians. When they sang Chinese songs like "The East Is Red," "On the Hills of Beijing," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations with great passion, they received thunderous applause.

Before parting, the revolutionary cadres of Shao Shan presented the Albanian comrades with Shao Shan commemorative badges. The leader of the art troupe wrote in the guestbook with great enthusiasm: "Today's visit has allowed us to understand Chairman Mao's rich revolutionary practice. From this, we have been greatly inspired. Chairman Mao is a staunch revolutionary for the cause of communism, a shining example and model of Marxism-Leninism. He is a great thinker, a great scientist, and a great Marxist-Leninist philosopher. With his practice and works, he has enriched and developed the treasury of Marxism-Leninism in theory and practice, making great contributions. Comrade Mao Zedong is the closest friend of the Albanian people and Comrade Enver Hoxha. His name is engraved in our hearts. Let us shout with all our hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the revolutionary thoughts of Mao Zedong!"

    阿尔巴尼亚战友访问伟大领袖毛主席家乡韶山
    毛泽东思想的光辉普照全世界
    新华社长沙二十六日电　在世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——湘潭县韶山冲，今天，红旗招展，歌声嘹亮，一片欢腾，来自反帝反修前线的阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团在这里度过了最难忘的一日。
    今天，群山环抱的韶山冲晴空万里。一千多名革命群众和当地驻军指战员，高举毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志的画像，聚集在韶山招待所前和公路两旁，高呼口号，敲锣打鼓，最热烈地欢迎来自“山鹰之国”的亲密战友。
    前些日子，我们的伟大领袖毛主席在北京接见了艺术团的同志，今天他们又亲自来到毛主席的家乡访问，每个人的心情极其激动。还在向韶山进发的途中，客人就一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，急切地向往着红太阳升起的地方。
    艺术团的同志到韶山后，兴致勃勃地走向毛主席的旧居。在旧居门前，阿尔巴尼亚战友挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，带头高呼“毛主席万岁！”他们还和中国同志一起高唱《在北京的金山上》等中国歌曲。许多阿尔巴尼亚战友自动围在一起，在这里摄下了最珍贵的镜头。农业合作社农民、民间艺人捷维特·采诺利十分激动地说，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，不仅领导着中国工人、农民进行斗争，而且指引着世界革命人民走上正确的革命道路。现在中国和世界革命人民正在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下胜利前进，毛泽东思想必将普照全世界！
    阿尔巴尼亚同志在毛主席旧居陈列馆里，了解到毛主席一家有六位亲人为了革命而献出了宝贵生命的时候，都万分激动。有的同志还把这六位烈士的名字一一记在笔记本上。斯库台少年宫主任安捷林·库木利亚说，我过去早就听到过许多关于毛主席青少年时代的光辉事迹，通过参观，更使我亲眼看到了这一切。今后，更有助于讲解毛主席青少年时代的革命活动。他感到今天是最有意义的一天，并且表示，要用毛主席的革命事迹，更好地教育阿尔巴尼亚青少年一代。艺术团团长穆·格尔查利十分激动地说：我们参观毛主席家乡感到无比幸福，这是我们毕生难忘的喜事，中国人民、阿尔巴尼亚人民和世界革命人民都为有了毛主席而感到光荣。
    在韶山，中阿两国人民还充分地表达了深厚的兄弟般的战斗友谊，相互亲切交谈，互赠纪念品。有一位阿尔巴尼亚朋友对中国同志说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。另一位朋友在中国同志的本上写道：毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他的光辉思想照耀着全世界人民胜利前进！当一位革命派战士向客人们介绍他们开展无产阶级文化大革命的情况时，艺术团团长穆·格尔查利对誓死捍卫毛泽东思想的中国广大革命工人、革命农民表示非常钦佩。他希望中国无产阶级革命派为打倒帝国主义和现代修正主义而斗争，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    阿尔巴尼亚业余文艺战士今天还为韶山军民演出了文艺节目。当他们满怀激情地用中国话演唱中国歌曲《东方红》、《在北京的金山上》、《大海航行靠舵手》以及毛主席语录歌时，博得了一阵又一阵的雷鸣般的掌声。
    临别前，韶山无产阶级革命派向阿尔巴尼亚战友赠送了韶山纪念章。艺术团团长在留言簿上写下了热情洋溢的题词：今天的参观使我们了解了毛主席丰富的革命实践。从中我们受到了很大的鼓舞。毛主席是共产主义事业的坚强革命者，马克思列宁主义者的光辉典范和榜样。他是一位伟大的思想家，伟大的科学家，伟大的马克思列宁主义哲学家，他以自己的实践和作品，从理论上和实践上丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义的宝库，作出了伟大的贡献。毛泽东同志是阿尔巴尼亚人民和恩维尔·霍查同志的最亲密的朋友，他的名字已经铭刻在我们心中，让我们尽情地高呼：祝毛主席万寿无疆！毛泽东的革命思想万古长青！
