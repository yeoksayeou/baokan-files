The PLA support-left group stationed in Ganzhou Prefecture, together with the prefecture's proletarian revolutionary faction, organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They led mid-level cadres in the prefecture to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely combat the "self" in their minds and to fiercely criticize revisionism. This helped raise their ideological and political standards, further distinguishing them from the bourgeois reactionary line.

The mid-level cadres participating in this study class had, to varying degrees, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, made mistakes, and then locked themselves in their rooms for "self-reflection," fearing to go among the masses to check their mistakes and reform themselves. The support-left group and the prefecture's proletarian revolutionary faction studied these cadres' situations and believed that holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes and organizing them to study Chairman Mao's works was an effective way to raise their ideological standards, promote a high tide of learning and criticism, and further distinguish themselves from the bourgeois reactionary line.

When the study class first began, the participating cadres had various thoughts. Those who had made serious mistakes thought, "Whether I study or not, I'm going to be criticized anyway." Those who had made minor mistakes feared saying the wrong thing during the study and being caught "red-handed." The support-left group and the proletarian revolutionary faction believed that the essence of these cadres' incorrect attitudes towards study was their lack of understanding of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and their low awareness of the class struggle, the struggle between two roads, and the struggle between two lines. To address this situation, the support-left group and the proletarian revolutionary faction first organized these cadres to carry out class education with the content of "two remembrances and two comparisons": remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; remembering the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line and comparing it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At the "remembrance and comparison" meetings, everyone linked the exploitation and oppression they suffered from landlords and capitalists in the old society with the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalists within the party led by China's Khrushchev, who attempted to restore capitalism. They linked feudalism, capitalism, revisionism, and the bourgeois reactionary line, gaining a deeper understanding that the handful of capitalists within the party who took the capitalist road were the most dangerous and primary enemies under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country. Deputy Director Bo Fenghua of the Civil Affairs Bureau, in June, together with the Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, vowed to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death but was injured by the bad leaders manipulated by the handful of capitalists within the party who took the capitalist road. At the "remembrance and comparison" meeting, he used his personal experience to angrily denounce the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and said with great emotion: "It is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that has brought about the victory of the Chinese revolution; it is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that prevents China from changing color; it is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that has given us proletarians and laboring people everything. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the foundation of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We must defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with actual actions."

The support-left group also combined the "two remembrances and two comparisons" activities with on-site visits and discussions with the proletarian revolutionary faction, guiding the cadres participating in the study class to learn Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and principles on the proletarian cultural revolution in a living classroom, in front of living facts, and in front of two teachers (positive and negative examples). Many people shed painful tears and said excitedly: "A thousand things should not be done, ten thousand things should not be done, but forgetting one's roots after liberation is the worst; a thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes, but deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the biggest mistake."

The support-left group and the proletarian revolutionary faction helped the cadres in the study class to take the "Three Articles" as their motto, actively learn and apply them, deeply touch their souls, and fiercely combat their selfishness. Many mid-level cadres deeply realized that the fundamental reason they implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, lost their political direction, and joined the wrong side was that the "self" in their minds was causing trouble. All evil comes from "self," and all mistakes are born from "I." After raising their ideological awareness, some cadres who originally did not want to approach the revolutionary faction actively sought out the revolutionary faction to open their hearts, check their mistakes in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line and its harm, and ask the revolutionary masses to criticize their mistakes. Everyone expressed: We must treat the enemy in our minds who does not hold a gun, just like we treat the enemy on the battlefield who holds a gun. We must bravely, actively, and consciously launch a thorough criticism and overthrow the "self."

During the study process, the support-left group and the proletarian revolutionary faction consciously guided the cadres in the study class to go among the masses, approach the proletarian revolutionary faction, and undergo the tempering and testing of class struggle practice. They first organized the cadres to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the masses' viewpoint and mass line, enthusiastically discussing the brilliant achievements of the proletarian cultural revolution that believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and mobilized the masses. They deeply understood the teaching that "we should believe in the masses, we should believe in the party, these are two fundamental principles," making the cadres realize that the actual struggle of the mass movement is a good classroom for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works; the masses' eyes are the brightest, most able to distinguish right from wrong, and see our shortcomings and mistakes; the masses' power is the greatest, most able to push us to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, helping us get out of the mud of the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the serious, active, and enthusiastic help of the support-left group and the proletarian revolutionary faction, the cadres in the study class actively participated in the great criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely combat selfish thoughts, and using Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize and expose the bourgeois reactionary line and revisionism.

Through the study, these mid-level cadres' ideological and political standards rapidly improved, and they were gradually recognized by the revolutionary masses, standing out to work in batches. Some even participated in the temporary preparatory group for the Ganzhou Revolutionary Committee. Recently, they have also deeply studied Comrade Lin Biao's important speech on National Day, unanimously expressing their determination to firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "criticize selfishness and revisionism," undergo tests and tempering in actual struggles, and forever stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, creating new merits for the people!

　　扩大教育面　缩小打击面
　　赣州举办毛泽东思想学习班教育中层干部干部
　　思想政治水平迅速提高，一批批站出来工作，有的参加了专区革委会临时筹备小组
    据新华社南昌十五日电　人民解放军驻赣州专署支左小组指战员，和专署无产阶级革命派一起举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织专署机关中层干部活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，狠批修正主义，帮助他们提高了思想政治水平，进一步和资产阶级反动路线划清了界线。
    参加这期学习班的中层干部，在文化大革命中曾不同程度地执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，又自己把自己关在屋子里“闭门思过”，不敢到群众中去检查错误，改造自己。支左小组指战员和专署无产阶级革命派研究了这些干部的情况，认为通过开办毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们学习毛主席著作，是提高他们的思想水平，推动他们掀起大学习、大批判高潮，进一步划清同资产阶级反动路线的界线的好办法。
    学习班刚开办时，参加学习的干部存在着各种各样的活思想。犯了严重错误的认为“学也好，不学也好，反正是要挨批判。”犯了一般错误的干部，就怕参加学习时说错了话，给抓住“辫子”过不了关。支左小组指战员和无产阶级革命派认为：这些干部对学习所抱的种种不正确态度的实质，是他们对无产阶级专政下的革命不理解，对两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的觉悟不高。针对这种情况，支左小组和无产阶级革命派首先组织这些干部，开展以“两忆两比”为内容的阶级教育：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜。在“忆比”会上，大家把在旧社会受地主、资本家的剥削、压迫和以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派企图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行联系起来；把封建主义、资本主义、修正主义和资产阶级反动路线联系起来，更加深刻地认识到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是我国无产阶级专政条件下最危险、最主要的敌人。民政处副处长董芳华，今年六月和红卫兵革命小将一起誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的坏头头打伤。在“忆比”会上，他用自己亲身的经历，愤怒控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，大谈毛主席革命路线的甜，无比激动说：“有了毛主席的革命路线，才有中国革命的胜利；有了毛主席的革命路线，中国才不会改变颜色；有了毛主席的革命路线，才有我们无产阶级、劳动人民的一切。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是中国人民和世界人民的根本，我们一定要以实际行动，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线。”
    支左小组还把“两忆两比”活动与现场参观、和无产阶级革命派座谈访问等活的教育有机地结合起来，引导参加学习班的干部在活的课堂里，在活的事实面前，在正反面两个教员面前，学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，提高对两条路线斗争的认识。许多人流着沉痛的热泪，激动地说：“千不该，万不该，翻身忘本最不该；千错万错，离开了毛主席的革命路线，是最大的错。”
    支左小组指战员和无产阶级革命派，帮助学习班的干部，以“老三篇”为座右铭，活学活用，狠触灵魂，狠斗私心。许多中层干部深刻认识到自己在文化大革命中执行资产阶级反动路线，迷失政治方向，站错了队的根本原因，就是头脑里的“私”字作怪。万恶全从“私”字起，千错都是“我”字生。思想觉悟提高后，有的原来不愿接近革命派的干部，主动找革命派交心，检查自己执行资产阶级反动路线的错误和危害，请革命群众批评自己的错误。大家表示：要象在战场上对付拿枪的敌人一样，仇恨头脑里的不拿枪的敌人——“私”，勇敢地，积极地，自觉地大造“私”字的反，大革“私”字的命。
    在学习过程中，支左小组和无产阶级革命派的同志们还有意识地引导学习班的干部到群众里面去，接近无产阶级革命派，经受阶级斗争实践的锻炼和考验。他们针对干部的活思想，先组织干部学习毛主席有关群众观点、群众路线的教导，大谈无产阶级文化大革命相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众的辉煌战果，深刻理解“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理”的教导，使干部认识到群众运动的斗争实际，就是活学活用毛主席著作的好课堂；群众的眼睛最亮，最能分清是非，看清我们身上的缺点和错误；群众的力量最大，最能推动我们破私立公，帮助我们从资产阶级反动路线的泥坑里爬出来。在支左小组和无产阶级革命派严肃、积极、热情的帮助下，学习班的干部积极投入革命的大批判，用毛泽东思想狠斗私心杂念，用毛泽东思想大揭大批资产阶级反动路线和修正主义。
    通过学习，这些中层干部的思想政治水平迅速提高，不断地被革命群众所识别，一批一批地站出来工作，有的还参加了赣州专区革命委员会临时筹备小组。最近，他们又深入学习了林彪副主席国庆节的重要讲话，一致表示，要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，“斗私，批修”，在实际斗争中经受考验，接受锻炼，永远站在毛主席的革命路线一边，为人民立新功！
