	The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station highly praises the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards and points out that Thai revolutionary youth resolutely take the Chinese revolutionary Red Guards as their example and rise up to rebel against American imperialism and the Thanom-Paphob traitorous clique.

	The radio station said, the Chinese Red Guards are revolutionary young people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They are the vanguard in the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the pioneers in destroying the "four olds." They follow the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary teaching of "rebellion is justified," with the revolutionary spirit of "daring to defy the emperor," they rise up to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smashing the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in China, and have made great contributions to the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

	The radio station said, the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards has shaken the world. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are in a state of great panic. They are extremely afraid that the youth in their own countries will learn from the Chinese revolutionary Red Guards and rise up to rebel against them. While the revolutionary people of the whole world highly praise the Chinese Red Guards and love the Chinese Red Guards. Revolutionary youth in various countries take the Chinese revolutionary Red Guards as their example, love, admire, respect, and are loyal to the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and love their own country and people. They all rise up to rebel against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

	The radio station said, the Thai revolutionary youth, like revolutionary youth in other countries, resolutely take the Chinese revolutionary Red Guards as their example, learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards, and rise up to oppose American imperialism and the Thanom-Paphob traitorous clique. The American-Thai reactionaries are already very terrified of this, and they are stepping up the suppression of Thai revolutionary youth. However, the revolutionary actions of Thai youth are unstoppable by any force.
