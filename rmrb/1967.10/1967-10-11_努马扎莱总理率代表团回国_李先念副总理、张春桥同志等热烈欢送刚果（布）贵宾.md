By a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 11th:

The delegation led by Prime Minister and Head of Government of the National Revolutionary Movement of the Congo (Brazzaville), Ambassador Ambroise Noumazalaye, concluded their friendly visit to our country. Carrying the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Congolese people, they departed from Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 11th to return home.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, along with Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and PLA Shanghai Garrison leaders Zhang Chunqiao, Liao Zhengguo, Ma Tianhui, and Liu Wenxue, went to the airport to warmly see off the Congolese guests.

The visit of the Congolese delegation to our country further strengthened the friendly cooperative relations between China and the Congo (Brazzaville), and deepened the friendship between the two peoples.

Today, the Congolese guests received a warm send-off from the revolutionary masses of Shanghai at Hongqiao Airport. The crowd beat drums and gongs, holding up portraits of Great Leader Chairman Mao and Congolese President Massamba-Debat, repeatedly shouting, "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Congolese people!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville)!" The guests circled the field, bidding farewell to the revolutionary masses who came to see them off.

Also present at the airport to see them off were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Yixin. Congolese Ambassador to China Bazanga also came to see them off.

Some members of the delegation who remained in China to continue their visit also came to the airport to see them off.

On the 10th, Prime Minister Noumazalaye and other delegation members, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Shanghai Revolutionary Committee leaders Wang Hongwen and others, visited the suburban Maliao People's Commune in Shanghai. They received a warm welcome from the broad masses of commune members. The Congolese guests had a cordial exchange with representatives of the commune revolutionary committee and showed great interest in visiting the commune's self-managed farm tool factory, tractor station, electric irrigation station, livestock farm, and clinic.

The Congolese guests also visited the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory today, where they saw China's self-designed and manufactured 10,000-ton hydraulic press. After the visit, Prime Minister Noumazalaye enthusiastically praised the Shanghai workers' revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, and hoped that they would support the world revolution with more labor achievements.

On the 9th, the Congolese guests continued their visits and inspections, and watched a military performance by the Shanghai militia. In the evening, they also watched the modern revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl."
