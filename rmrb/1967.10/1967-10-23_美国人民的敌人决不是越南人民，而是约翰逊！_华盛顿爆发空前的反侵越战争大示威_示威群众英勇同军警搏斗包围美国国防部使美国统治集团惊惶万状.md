The enemy of the American people is not the Vietnamese people, but Johnson!

Washington saw an unprecedented anti-Vietnam War demonstration.

Protesters bravely fought with military police, surrounded the Pentagon, and left the American ruling class in a state of panic.

New China News Agency, October 22nd: Washington reports that just as American imperialism is being beaten bloody by the brave Vietnamese people on the battlefield in Vietnam, its policy of aggression is facing strong condemnation and opposition from people around the world, and at the same time, it is becoming increasingly unpopular at home, on the 21st, an unprecedented anti-Vietnam War demonstration erupted in the American capital, Washington. Protesters surrounded the Pentagon, and some even stormed into this heavily guarded restricted area, leaving the American ruling class in a state of panic.

Starting on the 20th, tens of thousands of protesters began to gather in Washington from various parts of the United States. Some protesters came from Texas in the south and Chicago in the north, while others traveled from Canada specifically to participate in the demonstration.

On the morning of the 21st, protesters from all directions converged at the Lincoln Memorial. Protesters held up signs reading "Bring the troops home immediately!", "Abolish the draft!", "We won't go to Vietnam!", "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese!", and waved the flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, filling the Lincoln Memorial square to capacity. By the time the rally began in the afternoon, over ten thousand protesters had gathered, with more continuing to pour in. Speakers at the rally strongly condemned Johnson's government for its Vietnam War policies, the draft, and the Pentagon, the war machine of American imperialism. They pointed out that the Vietnamese people are not the enemy of the American people, "We firmly believe that Johnson is the enemy." A black speaker also called on black soldiers in Vietnam to "lay down their weapons in their thousands and return home to fight here."

After the rally, the protesters, singing anti-war songs and chanting slogans against the Vietnam War, marched in a grand procession towards the Pentagon.

Faced with the surging tide of American people's opposition to the Vietnam War, the Johnson administration was in a state of panic. Before the outbreak of this large-scale anti-Vietnam War demonstration, the U.S. authorities had taken various repressive measures. On the one hand, they rushed the Senate and House of Representatives to pass new legislation on the 19th, banning demonstrations in the Capitol building; on the other hand, they urgently airlifted six thousand paratroopers from California thousands of miles away and stationed them in the basements and corridors of the Pentagon. They also canceled the holidays of Washington's police force, mobilized four thousand National Guardsmen, and set up multiple lines of defense in front of the Pentagon. Out of the forty doors of the Pentagon, only one was left open. Additionally, twenty thousand troops were stationed near Washington's bases, ready to suppress the protesters at any moment.

On the morning of the demonstration, Defense Secretary McNamara personally took charge at the Pentagon, deploying the suppression of the protesters. The U.S. government also ordered strict protection for President Johnson and various cabinet members, with Johnson himself hiding in the White House, fully exposing the Johnson administration's paper tiger nature, afraid of the people.

After the protesters arrived at the Pentagon, they quickly surrounded it and bravely charged towards the Pentagon. Fascist military police wielding clubs and gun butts beat the protesters and released tear gas, carrying out a mad suppression. However, the protesters, undeterred by arrests and beatings, broke through the military police's layers of defense. Some protesters stormed into the only unlocked door of the Pentagon and engaged in fierce struggles with the military police in the corridors. Many also threw bottles and cans at the windows of the Pentagon.

As night fell, tens of thousands of protesters still surrounded the Pentagon. They lit bonfires, and many young people burned their draft cards over the fires. According to Western news agencies, despite the Johnson administration's brutal suppression of the protesters, arresting over three hundred and fifty people, "the situation remains very tense."

    美国人民的敌人决不是越南人民，而是约翰逊！
    华盛顿爆发空前的反侵越战争大示威
    示威群众英勇同军警搏斗包围美国国防部使美国统治集团惊惶万状
    新华社二十二日讯　华盛顿消息：正当美帝国主义在越南战场上被英勇的越南人民打得头破血流，它的侵略政策遭到全世界人民的强烈谴责和反对，同时在国内越来越不得人心的时候，二十一日在美国首都华盛顿爆发了规模空前的反对侵越战争的大示威。示威者包围了美国国防部——五角大楼，部分示威群众还冲进了这个重兵把守的禁地，使美国统治集团惊惶万状。
    从二十日开始，成千上万名示威群众就从美国各地陆续赶到华盛顿集中。有的示威者是从美国南部的得克萨斯和北部的芝加哥等地来的，有的还是从加拿大专程赶来参加示威的。
    二十一日清晨，示威群众从四面八方涌到林肯纪念碑前集合。示威群众高举着“立即撤回军队！”“废除征兵制度！”“我们不去越南（打仗）！”“越南是越南人的！”等标语牌，以及越南民主共和国国旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，把林肯纪念碑前的广场挤得水泄不通。到下午大会开始时，已有十余万示威者集合起来，同时还有大批大批的群众不断向广场涌来。在大会上发言的人，强烈谴责约翰逊政府执行的侵越战争，谴责征兵制度和五角大楼这个美国帝国主义的战争机器。他们指出，越南人民决不是美国人民的敌人，“我们深深地相信，只有约翰逊才是敌人”。一个黑人在发言中，还号召侵越美军中的黑人“成千成万地放下武器回到国内，在这里进行战斗”。
    大会以后，示威队伍高唱反战歌曲，高呼反对侵越战争的口号，浩浩荡荡地向美国国防部所在地五角大楼进发。
    面对美国人民反对侵越战争的怒潮的不断高涨，约翰逊政府惊慌失措，怕得要死。在这次反对侵越战争的大示威爆发之前，美国当局就采取了种种镇压措施，它一方面要美国参、众两院在十九日匆匆通过一项新的立法，禁止在国会大楼内举行示威；另一方面又从几千里以外的加利福尼亚紧急空运六千名伞兵，把他们安置在五角大楼的地下室和走廊里，并下令取消了华盛顿市警察的假期，调来了四千名国民警卫队，在五角大楼前设置了重重防线，五角大楼的四十个门，只留一个门通行。另外还有两万名军队驻在华盛顿附近的基地，以便随时开来镇压示威群众。
    示威的当天上午，国防部长麦克纳马拉亲自坐镇五角大楼，部署对示威群众的镇压。此外美国政府还下令对总统约翰逊和各部部长严加“保卫”，约翰逊本人更是怕得要命，龟缩在白宫里。这充分暴露了约翰逊政府害怕人民的纸老虎的本质。
    示威群众到达五角大楼后，迅速包围了五角大楼，并勇敢地向五角大楼冲去。挥舞棍棒和枪托的法西斯军警毒打示威者，并施放催泪瓦斯，进行疯狂镇压。但是，示威群众不怕逮捕和殴打，冲破了军警的层层防线，部分群众冲进了五角大楼唯一没有上锁的大门，在走廊里和军警展开了激烈的搏斗。许多人还向五角大楼的许多窗户投掷瓶子和锡罐头。
    当夜幕降临时，成千上万的示威者仍然包围着五角大楼，他们升起了篝火，许多青年还在篝火上烧掉了自己的征兵证。据西方通讯社报道，尽管约翰逊政府对示威群众进行残酷的镇压，逮捕了三百五十多人，但是“局势仍然十分紧张”。
