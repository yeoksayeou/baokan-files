“Though we are separated by mountains and rivers, our hearts are close together.” The People’s Republic of China and the People’s Socialist Republic of Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but our hearts are united. We are your genuine friends and comrades. You are also our genuine friends and comrades.
