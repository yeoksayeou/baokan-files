Shanghai Ink Factory Uses Mao Zedong Thought to Lead the Revolutionary Criticism and Achieves Good Experience

	With the class struggle intensifying, Shanghai Ink Factory, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, has been deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism. The factory has established revolutionary committees in each workshop and work team, closely linking the criticism with the factory's own struggle, criticism, and reform, and fiercely criticizing revisionism.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai, our reporter comments: Shanghai Ink Factory, based on achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, and consistently carries out in-depth revolutionary criticism. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, the workers have launched a "people's war" against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have closely linked the revolutionary criticism with the factory's actual conditions, integrating it with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit. The entire factory is now in a great revolutionary situation.

	Mao Zedong Thought Guides Revolutionary Criticism

	The revolutionary workers of Shanghai Ink Factory have always used Mao Zedong Thought to guide and lead the revolutionary criticism, studying Mao Zedong's works extensively during the criticism.

	In late March this year, the factory established a revolutionary committee. The committee led the workers to carry out revolutionary criticism. However, many workers initially had insufficient understanding of revolutionary criticism. The factory revolutionary committee organized the study of Chairman Mao's works and relevant editorials from the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine. Through study and discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that although the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed and become "falling dogs," they still try to stand up and bite. This sharp and complex class struggle has not ended. Only by criticizing and exposing the revisionist poison spread by the handful of power-holders within the Party, led by Chinese Khrushchev, in politics, ideology, and theory, can we prevent the restoration of capitalism.

	Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, the entire factory's workshops and work teams quickly launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. During the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers further seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, closely linking extensive study with extensive criticism.

	Work Teams as the Base for Revolutionary Criticism

	Shanghai Ink Factory established revolutionary criticism teams in each workshop and work team, carrying out revolutionary criticism based on work teams. This approach has many advantages: it can fully mobilize the masses to participate in this magnificent struggle, fighting a solid "people's war"; workers are most familiar with and understand the issues within their own workshops and work teams, so conducting revolutionary criticism within the work team will inevitably link to the actual conditions of their own departments and work teams, making revolutionary criticism closely integrated with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit; it can effectively improve the revolutionary workers' ability to distinguish between right and wrong and to identify true revolutionaries, pseudo-revolutionaries, and counter-revolutionaries during the process of using Mao Zedong Thought to expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by Chinese Khrushchev.

	Many work teams have old and young workers collaborating closely in the revolutionary criticism. Old workers recount the sufferings of the old society, while young workers listen and organize the information into big-character posters for criticism. The factory revolutionary committee promptly summarized this good experience and promoted it throughout the factory. The revolutionary criticism in the entire factory became deeper, and the enthusiasm of the masses grew higher. Starting from late March, they have successively criticized Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "suffering small losses for big gains," the theory of "taming tools," the theory of "exploitation is meritorious," the theory of "class struggle extinction," and various revisionist black goods in enterprise management, among others. Through revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses in the entire factory have received profound education, arousing stronger class hatred towards the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and deepening their class feelings towards our great leader Chairman Mao.

	Firmly Grasping the Direction of the Struggle

	During the continuous revolutionary criticism, Shanghai Ink Factory paid attention to preventing the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in the forms of rightist or ultra-"leftist" tendencies, firmly grasping the direction of revolutionary criticism.

	During the process of carrying out revolutionary criticism, the ink factory was also influenced by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois trends. However, the factory revolutionary committee led the revolutionary workers to timely eliminate these influences. They frequently conducted situation analyses, helping the revolutionary workers in the entire factory to recognize the current good situation. If some revolutionary workers were influenced by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois trends, they conducted ideological and political work, addressing the issues early by studying Chairman Mao's works and situation education, helping them to correct their attitudes and join the revolutionary criticism. In handling these issues, they strictly followed Chairman Mao's instructions, clearly distinguishing between two types of contradictions. For issues of understanding, they followed the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to provide assistance; for individual troublemakers who took advantage of the situation, they firmly fought against them. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly eliminating the influence of non-proletarian thoughts within the revolutionary ranks, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and continuing the revolutionary criticism according to the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

	Revolutionary Criticism Closely Linked with the Unit's Struggle, Criticism, and Reform

	The fourth experience of Shanghai Ink Factory in continuously carrying out revolutionary criticism is gradually linking it with the unit's struggle, criticism, and reform, making the revolutionary great unity, revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and revolutionary new order more solid.

	The practice of Shanghai Ink Factory has proven that the closer the revolutionary criticism is linked with the unit's struggle, criticism, and reform, the higher the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses to participate in the criticism. Half a year of practice has strongly demonstrated: revolutionary criticism promotes the thought revolutionization of people and the management revolutionization of enterprises. Many outdated rules and regulations that constrained the workers' hands and feet were thoroughly eliminated during the criticism, and workers' political enthusiasm universally surged. "Grasp revolution, promote production" has achieved extremely remarkable results. Since this year, production has been increasing month by month. The oil ink production in the first half of the year exceeded the state plan by 19 percent, increasing by 39 percent compared to the same period last year, with improved quality and reduced costs. Since the third quarter, production has further developed compared to the first half of the year.

	Currently, the revolutionary workers in the entire factory have further launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting the continued in-depth development of revolutionary criticism.

### 以班组为单位开展革命大批判

    上海油墨厂用毛泽东思想统帅大批判取得好经验
    以班组为单位开展革命大批判
    按车间、班组成立批判小组，紧密结合本单位斗批改，狠批修正主义。
    据新华社上海电　本社记者述评：上海油墨厂在实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的基础上，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终坚持深入开展革命的大批判，以毛泽东思想为武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了一场“人民战争”，并且紧密地联系工厂企业的实际，把革命大批判和本单位的斗批改结合起来，全厂出现了一片大好革命形势。
    以毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判
    上海油墨厂革命职工始终用毛泽东思想统帅和指导革命的大批判，在革命的大批判中大学大用毛主席著作。
    今年三月底，油墨厂建立了革命委员会。革委会领导大家开展了革命大批判。但是，不少职工开始对革命大批判认识不足。厂革委会就组织大家学习毛主席著作，学习《人民日报》和《红旗》杂志的有关社论。通过学习和讨论，大家一致认识到，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派虽然被揪出来了，成了“落水狗”，但他们仍想爬起来咬人。这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争并没有结束。只有从政治上、思想上、理论上把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他们在各个方面所散布的修正主义流毒，才能防止资本主义复辟。
    在厂革委会的领导下，全厂各车间、班组迅速掀起了革命大批判的高潮。在革命大批判中，革命职工进一步认真学习毛主席著作，把大学习和大批判紧密结合起来。
    以班组为革命大批判的基地
    上海油墨厂按车间、班组成立革命大批判小组，以班组为单位开展革命的大批判。这样做有许多好处：能够最充分地发动群众参加这场轰轰烈烈的斗争，打一场扎扎实实的“人民战争”；因为工人对工厂、车间、班组里的问题最熟悉，最了解，在班组里搞革命大批判，必然会联系到本部门、本班组的实际情况，革命大批判就势必同本单位的斗批改紧密地结合起来；能够在用毛泽东思想揭发、批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的过程中，有效地提高革命职工识别大是大非，识别真革命、假革命和反革命的能力。
    许多班组的老年工人和青年工人在革命的大批判中密切配合。老工人诉旧社会的苦，青年工人一边听一边整理，写成大批判的大字报。厂革委会及时总结了这一好经验，向全厂推广。全厂革命大批判越批越深，群众的积极性也越来越高。他们从三月底开始，先后批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所竭力鼓吹的“吃小亏占大便宜”、“驯服工具”论、“剥削有功”论、“阶级斗争熄灭”论以及企业管理方面的修正主义黑货，等等。通过革命大批判，全厂革命群众受到了深刻的教育，激起了对一小撮反革命修正主义分子更强烈的阶级仇恨，增强了对我们伟大领袖毛主席更深厚的阶级感情。
      牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    上海油墨厂在持续开展革命大批判中，注意防止以右的或极“左”的形式出现的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的影响，牢牢掌握革命大批判的大方向。
    油墨厂在开展革命大批判的过程中，也曾经受到资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮的影响。但厂革委会领导全厂革命职工及时地扫除了这些影响。他们经常进行形势分析，让全厂革命职工认清当前的大好形势。如果在革命职工中有人受到资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮的影响，他们就进行思想政治工作，抓住苗子，及早通过学习毛主席著作和形势教育，帮助他们端正自己的态度，投入革命的大批判。他们在处理这些问题时，坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。属于认识上的问题，就按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式进行帮助；对个别乘机捣乱、想混水摸鱼的坏分子，就坚决进行斗争。他们遵循毛主席的教导，坚决从革命队伍内部彻底肃清非无产阶级思想的影响，开展批评与自我批评，按照毛主席指引的方向，把革命大批判进行到底。
  大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合
    油墨厂能持续开展革命大批判的第四个经验，是在大批判过程中，逐步地同本单位的斗批改结合起来，革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”、革命的新秩序也就更趋巩固。
    油墨厂的实践证明，大批判和本单位的斗批改结合得越密切，革命群众投入大批判的积极性就越高。半年来的实践有力地说明：革命的大批判促进了人的思想革命化和企业管理革命化，许多束缚职工群众手脚的陈规陋章在大批判中被彻底破除后，工人政治热情普遍高涨。“抓革命，促生产”，取得了极为显著的效果。今年以来，生产月月上升，上半年的油墨产量超额百分之十九完成了国家计划，比去年同期增加百分之三十九，质量提高，成本下降。第三季度以来，生产比上半年又有新的发展。
    现在，全厂革命职工进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，以促进革命大批判的继续深入发展。
