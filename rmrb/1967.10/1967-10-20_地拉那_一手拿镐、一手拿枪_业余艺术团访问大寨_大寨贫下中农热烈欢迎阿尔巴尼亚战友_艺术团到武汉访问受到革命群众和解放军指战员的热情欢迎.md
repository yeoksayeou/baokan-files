By a delegation led by team leader Mu Gercali, the "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun" Amateur Art Troupe from Tirana, Albania, consisting of 98 members, visited the Dazhai Production Brigade of Dazhai People's Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, yesterday. They were warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai.

When the Albanian comrades arrived by car at Yangquan Station, Shanxi Revolutionary Committee Vice Chairman and Dazhai Brigade Party Secretary Chen Yonggui, Brigade Leader Jia Chengran, and Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee Core Group Leader Li Hansuo, who had traveled specially from Dazhai to Yangquan to welcome their comrades, warmly shook hands and embraced the Albanian comrades.

Yesterday, Dazhai was filled with a festive atmosphere. Around 9 AM, when Chen Yonggui and others escorted the art troupe comrades to the entrance of Dazhai Village, the village immediately buzzed with excitement, and the sound of drums and gongs filled the air. The villagers held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and our dear friend, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as the national flags of China and Albania, shouting slogans and warmly welcoming the visitors.

After a brief rest, the art troupe members, dusty from their journey, began their tour under the escort of Chen Yonggui and others. Chen Yonggui excitedly introduced that this year, under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there has been a bumper harvest nationwide, throughout the province, the county, and the commune. The Dazhai peasants, responding to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in more than a decade. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Team leader Mu Gercali warmly congratulated the great fruits brought by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by our great leader Chairman Mao; he praised the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people. He said, the most important thing about Dazhai's victory is that the Dazhai peasants have Mao Zedong Thought.

The art troupe comrades also visited the new caves built by the Dazhai people and the homes of the villagers. After the tour, the art troupe comrades and the villagers had a friendly chat.

In the afternoon, this amateur art troupe composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, and other laborers held a get-together with the Dazhai villagers. The art troupe performed programs full of fighting friendship for the Dazhai villagers. Amidst warm applause, Chen Yonggui and Albanian Amateur Art Troupe leader Mu Gercali exchanged gifts.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan, today, the "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun" Amateur Art Troupe from Tirana, Albania, arrived in Wuhan for a visit. The revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Wuhan, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha as well as the national flags of China and Albania, beat drums and gongs, warmly welcoming the Albanian comrades.

Today, when the train carrying the Albanian comrades arrived, the entire station was in a festive mood. Shouts of "Mao Zedong—Enver" and "Enver—Mao Zedong" echoed through the sky. In the afternoon, when the art troupe comrades visited the Yangtze River Bridge, the bridge above and below were packed with welcoming crowds. Wherever the Albanian comrades went, cheers erupted.
