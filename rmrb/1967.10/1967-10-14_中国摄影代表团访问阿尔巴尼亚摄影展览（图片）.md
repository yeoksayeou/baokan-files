The great, unbreakable fighting friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania was forged by the great leaders of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. They warmly met each other.

The sun shone brightly, and the crowds rejoiced. Comrade Enver Hoxha came among the people, and millions of smiling faces greeted their beloved leader. Millions of red hearts turned towards their beloved leader, expressing their boundless love for the great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in the hearts of the people of the world! The Albanian people love you dearly, and all revolutionary people of the world love you dearly! Your brilliant thoughts are a beacon, illuminating the revolutionary path for the people of the world. The picture shows the Albanian people attentively studying Chairman Mao's works.

The great wall of the Albanian people, the heroic Albanian People's Army, is advancing bravely on the path of revolution and combat. The officers and soldiers of the Albanian People's Army love the great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, with all their hearts. The picture shows the officers and soldiers of the people's army studying the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha with great concentration.

The Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian people resolutely oppose imperialism and revisionism. The picture shows the Albanian people holding a rally to support the heroic Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation war.

The Albanian people are using revolutionary new weapons—"lightning reports" (big-character posters)—with full political enthusiasm to fiercely attack backward customs.

Albanian youth are actively advancing along the path of revolution.
