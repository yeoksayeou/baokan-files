Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union criticize Sholokhov

Time: January 10, 1964
Place: Examination room of a certain university in the Soviet Union

Examination question: The significance of Sholokhov's novella "One Man's Fate" to the development of Soviet literature

Chinese student: In the great Patriotic War, the heroic Soviet people demonstrated their heroic spirit before the world. They were fearless, unyielding, and fought bravely, sacrificing themselves. Countless heroes like Paul Korchagin, Zoya, and Shura emerged, defeating the German fascists and defending their homeland. They greatly aided the liberation of the peoples of Eastern Europe and made an indelible contribution to the progress of humanity. The Soviet people are infinitely proud of this great victory.

The protagonist of the novella "One Man's Fate," Sokolov, also experienced this great war. In Sholokhov's portrayal, he is a hero who is praised. Now let us see what Sokolov thought, did, and felt in this great war? What does the author want to convey through the description of his fate?

In the great October Revolution, Sokolov lost his father and brother and lived alone. Marriage brought him happiness; he established a family and had a beloved wife. Later, he also had a son and daughter, and he was particularly proud of his son's intelligence. However, the Patriotic War took away his wife and children, destroying his happy family, leaving him alone. He is so miserable! When the author describes the scene of meeting Sokolov, he particularly vividly describes Sokolov's eyes, which are filled with pain, pity, and despair.

The author deeply sympathizes with Sokolov's fate and, through the description of his fate, raises such questions: Who destroyed Sokolov's happiness? How can Sokolov's happiness be preserved? The answer is very clear. The author's intention is: The Patriotic War destroyed Sokolov's happiness. If it were not for the Patriotic War, Sokolov would not have ended up with his family destroyed, and he would have been a very happy person. Therefore, the way to preserve Sokolov's happiness is to oppose the Patriotic War—this is Sholokhov's thought.

Soviet revisionist teacher: What? Sholokhov opposes the Patriotic War?

Chinese student: Yes. By the way, in the film "One Man's Fate," there are many dark and terrifying scenes. Whether it is the novella or the film, the author tries to emphasize the horror of the Patriotic War. We know that the great Patriotic War is a just war. Marxism-Leninism tells us that such a just war is what the people need; what should be opposed are those plundering, aggressive, unjust wars. Sholokhov opposes such a just war as the Patriotic War, which means he opposes all just wars.

Soviet revisionist teacher: Do the Soviet people need the sacrifice of eight million people?

Chinese student: The Soviet friends I have come into contact with, when they talk about the Patriotic War, do not think of it as you say, that it only brought the sacrifice of eight million people. They proudly believe that it is precisely the great victory of the Patriotic War that won the independence of the Soviet motherland, maintained national dignity, greatly promoted the revolutionary struggle of the world's peoples, and wrote a glorious page in the history of the international communist movement.

In this novel, the author completely distorts the image of Soviet communists. The only communist in the novel has not a trace of a communist spirit but is a complete coward.

Soviet revisionist teacher: A coward?

Chinese student: Yes, just look at this scene: In the prisoner-of-war camp, the traitor discovered the communist.

The traitor said: "I will betray you to the Germans."

The communist: "Comrade, please do not betray me..."

The traitor: "I am not your comrade, your comrades are in the rear."

To save himself from being betrayed, he calls the traitor a comrade and shamefully begs the traitor. Is this the image of a communist? What does it have in common with Zoya's image? This is a slander against Soviet communists.

Soviet revisionist teacher: But didn't this communist later kill the traitor?

Chinese student: Killed him! Soviet revisionist teacher: Isn't this heroism?

Chinese student: One must first clarify a problem: Why did he kill the traitor, and then one can judge whether it is heroism. The traitor decided to betray him, and in such a situation, he knew that begging would be useless, so he had the idea of killing him. But if the traitor had agreed not to betray him, this communist would certainly not have killed him. His purpose in begging was to save his life, and his purpose in killing was still to save his life. This is completely different from the revolutionary heroism of Soviet communists who are unyielding in the face of death. Soviet revisionist teacher: Why must a communist die in vain? Can't his strategy be more flexible?

Chinese student: The flexibility of strategy is based on the premise of adhering to principles. Lenin said, "Flexibility" that loses its principled nature is not true flexibility but sophistry.

Soviet revisionist teacher: But do you think there are no scoundrels among communists?

Chinese student: Of course, there are scoundrels among communists, but is an individual scoundrel the image of a communist? Sholokhov, in his work, portrays the only prominent communist as a complete coward. What impression does he want the readers to have? The only impression that can be obtained is: Soviet communists tremble and beg for mercy in the face of the enemy and death. This does not accord with historical truth.

Soviet revisionist teacher: The protagonist of this work is not this communist but Sokolov, who is portrayed as a people's hero. Why don't you talk about the protagonist but instead discuss a secondary character?

Chinese student: Alright! Now let us see what kind of "hero" this "people's hero" Sokolov is. When the Germans called him to drink and asked him to toast to the victory of Germany, he did not have the anger towards the enemy that Soviet people possess. He dared not say: "To the Soviet motherland!" Because he knew that if he said that, the Germans would immediately kill him. So he only said: "To my death, to my escape from pain." In this way, he survived. Finally, the Germans gave him a piece of bread, and he was so grateful! At a time when the Germans were starving Soviet prisoners of war, he actually received bread from the Germans! He hugged it tightly to his chest. When he returned to his comrades, he divided the bread among all of them, and each person only got a little. But in Sholokhov's portrayal, these starving Soviet prisoners of war actually cheered for getting a little of the Germans' bread, and not a single person stood up to say: "We do not want this piece of bread. We would rather starve to death than live in humiliation!" Because this is the Germans' mockery of us!

How many excellent sons and daughters of the Soviet people, how many Red Army soldiers, for the revolutionary ideal, for national dignity, died bravely! But the fearless spirit of the Soviet people cannot be found in the "people's hero" Sokolov, nor can it be found in so many Red Army prisoners of war. The image of the Soviet people has been terribly distorted. The author praises Sokolov as a heroic figure, but in my opinion, Sokolov is not only not a hero but also an extreme individualist. The following scene can illustrate this problem: The Red Army was advancing towards Berlin, and the Soviet people saw their own victory. At this moment, Sokolov lost his son, and he was in extreme pain. He said: "I buried my last hope and joy on this foreign German land."

For Sokolov, his son is his last hope and joy. Here, one should emphasize "last" and the meaning of this adjective. It means that losing his son means losing everything, and even the liberation of the motherland, the freedom of the people, and the victory over fascism cannot make up for this loss.

This is a typical example of personal happiness above all else.

Soviet revisionist teacher: You should understand Sokolov's feelings with human emotions. If you were in his position and your son sacrificed himself, wouldn't you feel heartbroken?

Chinese student: This question has no meaning to me because I do not have children. However, in my opinion, although it is unfortunate for parents to lose their children, if they are sacrificed for the people, then they die a worthy death, and parents should feel proud of this. This is the emotion of the proletariat. What kind of "human emotion" is Sokolov's?

(At this moment, another teacher enters, and the teacher says to that teacher: He calls humanitarianism extreme individualism, opposes just wars, etc. That teacher says: Just wars are also cruel.)

Soviet revisionist teacher: Have you seen "The Flight of the Wild Geese"?

Chinese student: I have seen it, and I have my own opinions on this film.

Soviet revisionist teacher: Do not ask him; he always has his own opinions.

Chinese student: In "One Man's Fate," Sholokhov tries to depict the Soviet government as having no "humanity." As the "hero" he loves, Sokolov, after being demobilized, became a truck driver. One day, because his truck injured a cow, the police confiscated his driver's license, and from then on, he lost his job and could not find work anywhere. The author wants to use this to tell people: Look! Such a heroic figure like Sokolov, just for a small mistake, the Soviet government makes him lose his job, and he has to start wandering. This is so inhumane!

Soviet revisionist teacher: (Loudly) Why do you have to bring the Soviet government into this? Stalin killed many people; this is his criminal behavior. Why do you mix the Soviet government with personal superstition? Why do you say the Soviet government has no humanity?

Chinese student: It is not I who say the Soviet government has no "humanity," but Sholokhov. Please ask: In Sholokhov's work, is the police officer who confiscated the driver's license from this hero with great achievements not a representative of the Soviet government? It is precisely to oppose Sholokhov's slander of the Soviet government that I criticize his work here.

Soviet revisionist teacher: This is the mistake of local officials. Why do you regard the mistake of individual officials as the mistake of the entire government?

Chinese student: I think it is necessary to repeat: It is not I who say the Soviet government has no "humanity," but Sholokhov. Let us think: What does "he cannot find work anywhere" mean? Why can he not find work anywhere? The author wants to say: The attitude of local governments towards this hero is the same mistake. Through such narration, the author is not telling the readers: Under Stalin's leadership, in the more than thirty years of the Soviet government, there is no "humanity"?

Now let us talk about the significance of "One Man's Fate" to the development of Soviet literature. Sholokhov uses his work to vigorously promote bourgeois humanitarianism in the Soviet literary world, opposing Marxism-Leninism's theory of class struggle...

Soviet revisionist teacher: (Interrupting the student) Why? Bourgeois? You must provide evidence for your views.

Chinese student: Marxism-Leninism believes: "The wars in history are divided into two categories: one is just, and the other is unjust. All progressive wars are just, and all wars that hinder progress are unjust. We communists oppose all unjust wars that hinder progress, but we do not oppose progressive just wars." Bourgeois humanitarianism, however, does not distinguish the nature of wars; it opposes all wars, including just wars. Sholokhov is exactly like this. Under the slogan of opposing war, he actually opposes such a sacred war as the Patriotic War. What is this if not bourgeois humanitarianism?

Soviet revisionist teacher: (To the students waiting for the exam) Please forgive us, we have argued for so long, we will end it now. (To the Chinese student) You give me the impression that you do not understand what typicity is. Now you answer the question again, and we will end it. Analyze the image of the protagonist Davydov in "Virgin Soil Upturned"!

Chinese student: Davydov is a communist who has lost his class standpoint. This is concentrated in his love relationship with Lyushka. Lyushka's lover is a son of a stubborn kulak who insists on a reactionary stance, a class enemy who should be eliminated. When he sneaked back from exile, he did not dare to enter the village, and he had nothing to eat. It was Lyushka who sent him food, giving him the energy to assassinate the party secretary. From this, it can be seen that Lyushka's behavior is not only a matter of moral corruption but also directly harms the interests of the Soviet government. Sholokhov imposes many errors on Davydov that are completely impossible for a true communist.

Soviet revisionist teacher: In Sholokhov's portrayal, Davydov knows that Lyushka is not a very good woman, but he wants to reform her. What is wrong with that?

Chinese student: In such a major work, from beginning to end, Davydov does not pay attention to the fact that his lover's behavior harms the interests of the Soviet government. It is unimaginable that since he has not recognized the class struggle here, how can he reform her? Soviet revisionist teacher: Didn't Sholokhov criticize Davydov on this issue?

Chinese student: If at the beginning of the book, he still pretends to adopt a critical attitude towards the protagonist in his book, then in the later chapters, the author's true face is completely exposed. For example: When people tell him that Lyushka has been driven out of the village because she harmed the interests of the Soviet government, will Davydov's mind be clear now? But after returning home, he still thinks of her and cannot sleep all night. And the author does not give even the slightest criticism of this action. There is another problem: How is Davydov's "love" relationship with Lyushka broken off? It is very clear that it is because people drove Lyushka out of the village, forcing it to be broken off, not because Davydov awakened. If Lyushka had not been driven away, Davydov would still continue to love her. This is very natural. This shows that Davydov, to the end, is still a communist who has lost his class standpoint. In Sholokhov's eyes, this is the typical communist. Isn't this a clear distortion?

Soviet revisionist teacher: Do you want to say that communists should not have love? Do you want to deprive them of the right to love?

Chinese student: You know, I am just an ordinary university student. How can I deprive them of the right to "love"? Everyone has the right to love. But communists do not have the right to "love" their class enemies. This is understood by anyone with a little Marxist-Leninist common sense.

专栏：

    考场上的反修斗争
    我留苏学生痛斥肖洛霍夫时　  间　一九六四年一月十日地  　点　苏联某高等学校考试题目　肖洛霍夫的中篇小说《一个人的遭遇》和它对苏联文学发
    展的意义我国留学生：在伟大的卫国战争中，英勇的苏联人民在全世界人民面
    前显示了自己的英雄气概。他们不怕牺牲，英勇不屈，前赴后继
    地战斗着，涌现出成千上万的保尔·柯察金，卓娅和舒拉那样的
    英雄，终于打败了德国法西斯，保卫了自己的祖国，大大地帮助
    了东欧各国人民的解放事业，对人类进步事业作出了不可磨灭的
    贡献。苏联人民为这一伟大的胜利感到无限的骄傲。
        小说《一个人的遭遇》主人公索科洛夫也经历了这一伟大的
    战争。在肖洛霍夫的笔下，他是一个被歌颂的英雄。现在让我们
    来看一看在这一伟大的战争中索科洛夫想了些什么？做了些什么？
    有些什么感受？通过对他命运的描写，肖洛霍夫想说些什么？
        在伟大的十月革命中，索科洛夫失去了父亲和兄弟，孤独地
    生活着。结婚给他带来了幸福，他建立了家庭，有了可爱的妻子，
    后来又有了儿子和女儿，他特别为儿子的聪明而自豪。可是卫国
    战争夺去了他的妻子和孩子，毁灭了他的幸福家庭，只剩下了孤
    独的一个人，他是多么痛苦！作者在叙述和索科洛夫相遇的情景
    时，特别细细致致地描写了索科洛夫的一双眼睛，那是一双充满
    痛苦、可怜、失望的眼睛。
        作者十分同情索科洛夫的遭遇，并且通过对他命运的描写，
    提出了这样一些问题：是谁破坏了索科洛夫的幸福？怎样才能保
    住索科洛夫的幸福？答案是十分明显的。作者的意思是：卫国战
    争破坏了索科洛夫的幸福，如果不是卫国战争，索科洛夫决不会
    弄到家破人亡的地步，他将是一个十分幸福的人。因此，保住索
    科洛夫幸福的办法就是不要卫国战争，应该反对卫国战争——这
    就是肖洛霍夫的思想。苏修教师：什么？肖洛霍夫反对卫国战争？我留学生：是的，顺便提一下，在电影《一个人的遭遇》里，有许多
    昏暗可怕的镜头。无论是小说，或是电影，作者极力想说明卫国
    战争的可怕，而我们知道伟大的卫国战争是正义的战争。马列主
    义告诉我们，这种正义战争是人民所需要的；应该反对的只是那
    些掠夺性的、侵略性的非正义战争。肖洛霍夫反对象卫国战争这
    样的战争，这意味着他反对一切正义的战争。苏修教师：难道苏
    联人民需要八百万人的牺牲吗？卫国战争是正义的战争，但是要
    知道，卫国战争给苏联人民没有带来别的，只有八百万人的牺牲
    ——几乎大家都失去一个亲人。我留学生：我所接触到的苏联朋
    友们，在谈起卫国战争时，完全不象你所说的那样，认为只有八
    百万人的牺牲。他们骄傲地认为，正是伟大的卫国战争的胜利，
    才赢得了苏维埃祖国的独立，维护了民族的尊严，极大地推动了
    世界人民的革命斗争，在国际共产主义运动史上写下光辉的一页。
        作者在这部小说里完全歪曲了苏联共产党员的形象。小说里
    唯一的共产党员根本没有一点共产党员的气味，而是一个十足的
    怕死鬼。苏修教师：是怕死鬼？我留学生：是的，只要看看这样一段情节就够了，在俘虏营里，叛徒
    发现了共产党员。
        叛徒说：“我要把你出卖给德国人。”
        共产党员：“同志，我请你不要出卖我。……”
        叛徒：“我不是你的同志，你的同志在后方。”
        为了自己不被出卖，竟称叛徒为同志，并可耻地向叛徒请求，
    这难道是一个共产党员的形象吗？这和卓娅的形象有什么共同之
    处？这是对苏联共产党人的诬蔑。苏修教师：这个共产党员不是后来把叛徒杀死了吗？我留学生：杀死了！苏修教师：难道这不是英雄主义吗？我留学生：应该先搞清楚一个问题，他为什么要杀死那个叛徒，然后
    才能判断这是不是英雄主义。叛徒决心要出卖他，在这样的情况
    下，他知道再请求也没有用了，所以他有了杀死他的念头。但叛
    徒如果答应不出卖他呢？这个共产党员当然不会杀死他。他请求
    的目的是为了保命，他杀死他的目的还是为了保命，这与苏联共
    产党员在死亡面前不屈不挠的革命英雄主义完全是两回事。苏修教师：为什么共产党员非白白地死去不可呢？他的策略不可以灵
    活一点吗？我留学生：策略的灵活性是以坚持原则为前提的。列宁说过，失去原
    则性的“灵活性”不是真正的灵活性，而是一种诡辩主义。苏修教师：但您认为共产党员中没有混蛋吗？我留学生：当然，在共产党员中混蛋是有的，但个别的混蛋是共产党
    员的形象吗？肖洛霍夫在自己的作品中，把唯一突出的共产党员
    处理成十足的怕死鬼，他想让读者得到怎样的印象呢？能够得到
    的印象只有一个：苏联共产党员在敌人面前，在死亡面前发抖了，
    乞求慈悲了，这是不符合历史真实的。苏修教师：这个作品的主人公不是这个共产党员，而是作为人民形象
    的索科洛夫，您为什么不谈主人公，而去谈次要人物呢？我留学生：好！现在让我们来看看作为“人民形象”的索科洛夫是怎
    样一位“英雄”吧。当德国人把他找来喝酒，要他为德国的胜利
    而干杯时，他没有苏联人民具有的那种对敌人的愤怒，他不敢说：
    “为苏维埃祖国而干杯！”因为他知道，如果他这样说了，
    德国人马上就会杀死他。所以他只说：“为我的死亡，为我摆脱
    痛苦而干杯。”用这样的办法，他活下来了。最后德国人给他一
    片面包，他是多么感激啊！在德国人让苏军俘虏挨饿的时候，他
    竟得到德国人恩赐的面包！他把它紧紧地抱在胸前。回到同伴那
    里，他把面包分给了所有的人，每人只吃到一点。可是在肖洛霍
    夫的笔下，这些挨饿的苏军俘虏，竟为了吃到一点德国人的面包
    而欢呼起来，竟没有一个人站起来说：不要这片面包，宁愿饿死，
    也不愿忍辱地活着！因为这是敌人对我们的嘲弄！
        多少苏联人民的优秀儿女，多少红军战士，为了革命的理想，
    为了民族的气节而慷慨地死去！可是苏联人民大无畏的精神在作
    为“人民形象”的索科洛夫身上找不到，在这么多的红军俘虏里
    也找不到，苏联人民的形象遭到了可怕的歪曲。作者把索科洛夫
    作为英雄人物来歌颂，但照我看来，索科洛夫不仅不是英雄，而
    且是一个极端的个人主义者。下面一段情节很能说明问题：红军
    正向柏林挺进，苏联人民已看到了自己的胜利。正在这个时候，
    索科洛夫失去了自己的儿子，他痛苦到了极点。他说：“我在陌
    生的德国土地上埋葬了自己的最后希望和欢乐。”
        对索科洛夫来说，儿子是他的最后希望和欢乐。在这里应该
    强调“最后”与这个形容词的含义。它意味着失去了儿子就失去
    了一切，就连祖国的解放，人民的自由，以及对法西斯的胜利都
    不能弥补这一损失。
        这是个人幸福高于一切的典型。苏修教师：你应该用人类的感情来理解索科洛夫的心情，如果你处在
    他的地位，你的儿子牺牲了，难道你不觉得心痛吗？我留学生：这个问题对我来说没有任何意义，因为我还没有孩子。不
    过，在我看来，做父母的失去儿女固然是不幸的事，但如果他们
    是为人民而牺牲的，那就是死得其所，做父母的应该为此感到光
    荣，这才是无产阶级的感情。象索科洛夫那样的感情是什么“人
    类的感情”？
        （这时进来一个教员，教师对那教员说：他把人道主义说成
    是极端的个人主义、反对正义战争等等。那教员说：正义战争也
    是残酷的。）苏修教员：你看过《雁南飞》了吗？我留学生：看过了，对这部影片，我持有自己的意见。苏修教师：不要问他了，他总是有自己的意见。我留学生：在《一个人的遭遇》里，肖洛霍夫竭力想描绘出苏维埃政
    权没有“人性”。如作者所热爱的“英雄”索科洛夫复员后当上
    了汽车司机，一天，由于他的汽车压伤了一条母牛，警察就没收
    了他的司机证，从此他失去了工作而且到处找不到工作。作者想
    借此对人们说：看！象索科洛夫这样的英雄人物，只因一点过错，
    苏维埃政权就使他失去了工作，他不得不开始流浪，这多么没有
    “人性”啊！苏修教师：（大声地）您为什么要扯到苏维埃政权身上去？斯大林杀
    了很多人，这是他的犯罪行为。你为什么把苏维埃政权和个人迷
    信混杂起来？你为什么说苏维埃政权没有人性？我留学生：说苏维埃政权没有“人性”的不是我，是肖洛霍夫。请问：
    在肖洛霍夫的作品中，从这位丰功伟绩的“英雄”身上收去司机
    证的警察是不是苏维埃政权的代表？正是反对肖洛霍夫诬蔑苏维
    埃政权的做法，我才在这里批判他的作品的。苏修教师：这是地方工作人员的错误，你为什么要把个别工作人员的
    错误看成是整个政权的错误？我留学生：我认为有必要重复一遍，说苏维埃政权没有“人性”的不
    是我，而是肖洛霍夫。让我们想想“他到处找不到工作”意味着
    什么？为什么到处找不到呢？作者想说：各处的地方政权对待这
    位英雄的态度都是一样错误的。通过这样的叙述，作者不正是想
    告诉读者：在斯大林领导下的三十多年中苏维埃政权没有“人性
    ”吗？
        现在谈谈《一个人的遭遇》对苏联文学发展的意义。肖洛霍
    夫用自己的作品在苏联文坛大力宣扬资产阶级的人道主义，反对
    马列主义关于阶级斗争的学说……苏修教师：（打断学生的话）为什么？是资产阶级的？您必须对自己
    的观点加以论证。我留学生：马列主义认为：“历史上的战争分为两类，一类是正义的，
    一类是非正义的。一切进步的战争都是正义的，一切阻碍进步的
    战争都是非正义的。我们共产党人反对一切阻碍进步的非正义的
    战争，但是不反对进步的正义的战争。”资产阶级人道主义却不
    然，他们不区别战争的性质，反对一切战争，包括正义的战争在
    内。肖洛霍夫就是这样。在反对战争的口号下，他竟然反对象卫
    国战争那样神圣的战争，这不是资产阶级的人道主义又是什么呢？苏修教师：（向等着考试的同学）请同学们原谅，我们争论了这么久，
    我们马上就要结束了。（向我留学生）你给我的印象是：不懂得
    什么叫典型性。现在您再给我回答问题，我们就结束。您分析一
    下达维多夫这个《被开垦的处女地》中的主人公的形象吧！我留学生：达维多夫是一个丧失阶级立场的共产党员。这集中表现在
    他和路希卡的爱情关系上。路希卡的情夫是一个坚持反动立场的
    富农的儿子，一个应当被消灭的阶级敌人。当他从流放的地方偷
    跑回来的时候，他不敢进村，没有吃的，正是路希卡给他送了食
    物，让他有精力去暗杀党支部书记。由此可见，路希卡的行为不
    仅是道德败坏的问题，而且直接危害着苏维埃政权的利益。肖洛
    霍夫在达维多夫身上强加了许多对真正的共产党员来说完全不可
    能的错误。苏修教师：在肖洛霍夫的笔下，达维多夫知道路希卡不是一个顶好的
    女人，但他想改造她，这有什么不可以呢？我留学生：在这样一部大作品中，自始至终，达维多夫没有对他的情
    妇损害苏维埃政权利益的叛变行为引起重视，不可设想，他既然
    没有认识到这里的阶级斗争的内容，又怎么能够把她改造过来呢？苏修教师：肖洛霍夫不是也在这个问题上批评了达维多夫吗？我留学生：如果说开头的几章里他对自己书中的主人公还装作采取批
    评的态度的话，那么在以后的几章里，作者的面目便完全暴露出
    来了。例如：当人们告诉他，路希卡已被赶出村了，因为她损害
    了苏维埃政权的利益。这下子达维多夫的头脑该清醒了吧？可是
    他回家以后，仍然想她，晚上整夜睡不着觉。而作者对他这种举
    动没有给以任何的轻微的指责。这里还有一个问题，达维多夫和
    路希卡的“爱情”关系是怎样断掉的呢？很清楚，是因为人们把
    路希卡赶出村子，被迫断掉的，而不是由于达维多夫觉醒的结果。
    如果路希卡没有被赶走，达维多夫还会继续对她爱下去，这是十
    分自然的。这说明达维多夫到最后仍是一个丧失阶级立场的共产
    党员。在肖洛霍夫看来，这就是共产党员的典型。这不是明显的
    歪曲吗？苏修教师：你是想说共产党员不应该有爱情？你想剥夺他们爱的权利？我留学生：您知道，我只是一个普通的大学生。我怎能剥夺他们“爱
    ”的权利呢？每个人都有爱的权利。但是共产党员没有权利去“
    爱”自己的阶级敌人。这是每一个稍具马列主义常识的人所理解
    的。
    （考试到此结束）
