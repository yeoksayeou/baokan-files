A New Study Group Leader

In March 1966, a batch of new soldiers, after two months of training in the new recruits' company, were assigned to the 10th Company of the Engineering Corps of the General Logistics Department. Among them was a stocky, round-faced young man from Anhui, assigned to the 6th Platoon. He was Nian Siwang.

On the day Nian Siwang arrived at the company, after resting for an hour or so, the 6th Platoon held a meeting to welcome him. The platoon leader, pointing to Nian Siwang, happily introduced him to everyone: "This is Comrade Nian Siwang. He comes from a poor peasant family, is educated, and has attended two years of junior high school."

Everyone applauded warmly, welcoming Nian Siwang to say a few words.

Nian Siwang blushed and said to everyone, "Let's read 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' first, okay?"

Everyone immediately took out their red-bound "Selected Readings from Chairman Mao's Works," all saying, "Good! Good!" Thus, new and old comrades together read "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

After finishing, Nian Siwang said to his comrades, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We are all from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together.' Look, I am from Anhui, and comrades are from Henan, Shanxi, truly for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. In the future, we will read Chairman Mao's books together, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

A few words touched the hearts of his comrades, who all felt that this new comrade was politically outstanding and very down-to-earth.

The platoon leader said, "Comrade Nian Siwang is right. We must study Chairman Mao's works well. Now let's elect a study group leader."

"Choose him!" As soon as the platoon leader finished speaking, everyone unanimously pointed to Nian Siwang and said.

Although some people had not yet remembered Nian Siwang's name, Nian Siwang's first act in the platoon was to lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, which left a deep impression on everyone. Choosing such an enthusiastic comrade who studies Chairman Mao's works to be the study group leader would be correct!

The Most Meaningful Sunday

Comrades all said that Nian Siwang's Sundays were the most meaningful. Now, let's take the four Sundays of last October as an example to see how he spent them.

First Sunday: After breakfast, Nian Siwang sat on the edge of his bed to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." He recalled his thoughts and work since enlisting and deeply felt that his achievements were all the result of acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Sometimes his thoughts fluctuated, and work had flaws, all because he did not listen to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao's books could not be put down for a moment, the more he read, the more he loved them. He wrote in his "Study Notes":

	Chairman Mao's works are read every day,
	The heart is red and the eyes are bright, not lost.
	Chairman Mao's works are read every day,
	Revolutionary enthusiasm is boosted.
	Chairman Mao's works are read every day,
	Great difficulties can be overcome.
	Chairman Mao's works are read every day,
	Right and wrong are clear, poison can be resisted.
	Chairman Mao's works are read every day,
	Ghosts and snakes are all swept away.
	For a lifetime, read Chairman Mao's books,
	For a lifetime, walk the path guided by Chairman Mao.

Second and Third Sundays: As soon as he got up, he went to the kitchen to find work. He told the kitchen comrades: "Don't be polite, give me any work you have." He was seen chopping vegetables, washing rice, making fire, putting down the knife and picking up the bucket, busy to the point of not even wiping the sweat. The kitchen comrades were afraid he would get tired and said, "You've worked hard, rest a bit and then work!" He said while working, "If you say hard work, it's you who are hardworking. This little work is nothing!"

Fourth Sunday: After cleaning the inside and outside of the room, he carried a bucket of water to wash the bedsheets for his platoon comrades. Comrades came back and saw the bedsheets washed clean, not knowing for a long time that it was Nian Siwang who washed them.

Nian Siwang's Sundays were busy, but also happy. Like the great soldier Lei Feng, he invested his limited life into the endless service to the people.

A New Starting Point

A month's task of carrying stones was about to end, Nian Siwang's shoulders were swollen, his legs hurt, and his waist ached. Today, Nian Siwang came to the construction site, with his head down, not singing, not laughing.

The instructor, who was participating in the labor on the construction site, saw this situation and quickly caught up with Nian Siwang, smiling and saying, "Little Nian is really great, I hurried and couldn't catch up with you."

Nian Siwang smiled innocently.

"Little Nian, are you tired?"

Nian Siwang casually replied, "Not much, just grit your teeth and it will pass!" Saying this, he picked up the shoulder pole and ran off.

After work, the instructor found Nian Siwang again for a heart-to-heart talk. He said affectionately, "Little Nian, serving the people must be wholeheartedly, doing revolution must be done consciously. The revolutionary road is very long, and our responsibilities are very heavy. Can revolution be done by gritting teeth? Definitely not."

The instructor said this, pointing to the small willow trees beside him, meaningfully said, "These small willow trees, without sunlight and rain, cannot grow. Revolutionary soldiers do not use Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, the revolution has no direction, and will go astray. Little Nian! What is hidden behind this gritting of teeth?" Finally, the instructor also instructed Little Nian, "Study 'Old Three Articles' seriously, compare yourself, and dig deep in your thoughts."

That night, Nian Siwang tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He repeatedly thought about the instructor's heavy words. At eleven o'clock, he took out "In Memory of Norman Bethune" from under his pillow, sat up, and greedily read it under the dim light filtering through the door crack. Nian Siwang's gaze lingered for a long time on these few lines of shining words: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, it is thoroughly working for the interests of the people." How warm these words are! Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated Nian Siwang's heart. He recalled the path he had walked: carrying stones for a month, on the surface, he did well, but in his heart, there was a hidden "selfish" character. He felt that engineering soldiers deal with stones every day, which is hard and tiring, this is the "selfish" character acting up! Thinking of this, he said to himself, "Revolution cannot be done with a 'selfish' character, the 'selfish' character must be removed, consciously do the revolution, I must take this as a new starting point."

Launching an Offensive

In the scorching summer, the sun was like fire, baking the earth hot. The company was busy transporting asphalt sleepers. Asphalt corrodes the skin and hurts, but Nian Siwang did not frown, did not pant, and carried the oily sleepers and ran like the wind. After three days, he carried the most sleepers in the entire company, and his neck and face were the most severely corroded.

On the fourth day, Nian Siwang came to the construction site and saw that there was still a large pile of sleepers. He thought to himself, "When will it be finished?" This thought only flashed in his mind, and he immediately criticized himself, "Good, afraid of hard work and pain, afraid of difficulties! The 'selfish' character is rising, knock it down, resolutely knock it down! Bowing to difficulties is surrendering to the 'selfish' character." At this time, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The more difficult the place, the more you should go, this is a good comrade." Thus, he loudly read, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." He rallied his spirits, carried the sleepers, and ran quickly.

Every time Nian Siwang fought against the "selfish" character, his feelings for Chairman Mao's works deepened, picking up Chairman Mao's works, he felt especially intimate, thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, he worked with extra enthusiasm. He said, "I cannot be away from Chairman Mao's works for a moment."

Deputy Platoon Leader Sun Xiren saw his face and neck corroded by asphalt, looking like he had been smeared with glue, and felt sorry for him from the bottom of his heart. He wanted to give Nian Siwang a lighter job.

Nian Siwang thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, that young people are like the sun at eight or nine in the morning, he understood the meaning of hard work, felt his whole body tired and comfortable, and his heart was sweet. He told the platoon leader, "Chairman Mao said, 'Revolution is not like inviting guests to eat a meal,' fighting the 'selfish' character is also a revolution, it cannot be gentle, there must be fierce struggle to be effective, carrying sleepers is hard on the body, shoulders hurt, but this thought has been tempered, it is a severe blow to the 'selfish' character." These words were like hammered out of steel.

On the busy construction site of transporting sleepers, he opened up the battlefield in his mind, bravely fought the "selfish" character with bayonets, and actively launched an offensive against the "selfish" character. He said well, "'Selfish' character is like an enemy, you attack it, it also attacks you, you do not attack it, it will also attack you." In a word, annihilating the "selfish" character, must be proactive, launch an offensive, and completely annihilate it!

Fiercely Fighting the "Selfish" Character's "Flash of Thought"

Nian Siwang, with deep class feelings, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, fiercely fought against the "selfish" character's "flash of thought," reformed his worldview, and achieved great results. Everyone elected him as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. Thus, there were often comrades asking him to introduce his learning experience. Every time Nian Siwang introduced his experience, he laid out his deep-seated "selfish" character, dug out the root of the "selfish" character, and never talked about his good deeds.

Once, at a meeting to introduce his learning experience, he talked about an incident: One day, after stepping on mud, he drew a basin of hot water to wash his feet, turned around and came back, the hot water was gone, asking, it was used by a fellow platoon comrade. He was very unhappy, mumbling a few words. When Nian Siwang thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication, is shown in his extreme responsibility for work, and his extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people. Every communist must learn from him." He immediately felt that he was far from Chairman Mao's teachings. After stepping on mud, everyone wanted to wash their faces and feet, but only thought of using the water himself, did not think of comrades also needing water. The heart only thought of oneself, lacked enthusiasm for comrades, cold and indifferent, this was the "selfish" character acting up, how inappropriate! The next day, Nian Siwang apologized to his comrades and said, "My 'selfish' character, I must make it stink!"

From that day on, every time after work, Nian Siwang's first task was to draw water for the entire platoon to wash their faces and feet. Comrade Zhou Bengui was moved and said, "Nian Siwang has a bit of selfishness in his mind, and he talks about it everywhere, he wants to talk until the 'selfish' character stinks before he stops. I think this is the experience of breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit." Everyone also said, "Right, Nian Siwang fights the 'selfish' character, the standard is high."

Continuously Firing at the "Selfish" Character

The winter in the border area, the north wind howled, the cold air rolled, and the temperature dropped sharply.

The company was in the midst of a tense final construction project. The iron wires on the scaffolding were blown by the wind, making a wailing sound. Nian Siwang climbed onto the scaffolding, just as he stretched out his hand, the cold wind cut his fingers like a sharp knife, he immediately pulled his hand back. Later, he mustered his courage and started working.

On the construction site, the sound of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, slogans, wind, and the sound of labor intertwined into a stirring battle song.

After the retreat signal sounded, Nian Siwang tidied up his tools, rubbed his hands, and looked up to see the quotation board on the scaffolding. A few prominent golden words shone in his eyes: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, they will inevitably fight to the death with us, we must not underestimate these enemies." From this quotation, he was greatly inspired. He thought of the incident of pulling his hand back on the scaffolding, feeling that this was the "selfish" character acting up, having a "selfish" heart was not a small matter, it was a root of evil, it must not be underestimated! Thinking of the great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was a fierce class struggle, it was to ensure that our country remains red for generations, and not let the class enemies restore power. Class struggle was like this, ideological struggle was also like this. The "selfish" character, you retreated it, it would still appear in various forms, disguised, trying to restore power. Pulling back the hand was a signal of the "selfish" character's restoration, you feared the cold and pulled back, it would encroach inch by inch, and finally push you down from the scaffolding. What a cunning and hidden enemy! He said to himself, "'Selfish' character wants to restore power, I use 'public' character to defeat you, seize your power!"

The six or seven-level strong wind roared, as if it would blow the mountain away, the wind and sand blew so hard that one could not open their eyes. Stepping on mud froze his feet, but he insisted on stepping, his toes were frozen like red carrots, but his face was covered with hot sweat. The wind was strong on the scaffolding, he had just finished stepping on mud, holding a trowel, jumping and climbing to the more than ten-meter-high scaffolding to lay bricks. A gust of wind almost blew him down. Comrades were worried that he would be blown down by the strong wind and repeatedly called for him to come down. He responded loudly, "Now is the time, let me train myself well!" He, with the determination to thoroughly revolutionize, showed his defiance to the "selfish" character!

　　心里有个红太阳　斗私批修当闯将
　　——年四旺同志的故事
    新学习小组长
    一九六六年三月，一批新战士，在新兵连学习了两个月之后，被分配到总后勤部某工程部队十连。其中有一个胖墩墩身材、圆圆脸的安徽青年，分到了六班。他就是年四旺。
    年四旺这天刚到连队，休息了个把小时，六班就开会欢迎他。班长指着年四旺，高兴地向大家介绍说：“这位是年四旺同志，他出身在贫农家庭，有文化，上过两年初中。”
    大家热烈鼓掌，欢迎年四旺说两句话。
    年四旺脸红了，向大家说：“我们先学一遍《为人民服务》好吗？”
    全班同志马上拿出红彤彤的《毛泽东著作选读》，都说：“好！好！”于是新老同志一起朗读了一遍《为人民服务》。
    读完，年四旺对同志们说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。’你看，我是安徽人，同志们有的是河南人、山西人，真正是为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。今后我们一起读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”
    几句话，说到同志们心坎里了，都觉得这位新战友突出政治，朴实得很。
    班长说：“年四旺同志说得对，咱们一定要把毛主席著作学习搞好。现在咱们选个学习小组长吧。”
    “就选他！”班长的话刚落音，大家不约而同地指着年四旺说道。
    虽然有的人还没有记下年四旺的名字，但年四旺到班里的头一件事，就是带头活学活用毛主席著作，给了大家深刻的印象。选这样热情学习毛主席著作的新战友来担任学习小组长，错不了！
    最有意义的星期天
    战友们都说年四旺的星期天过得最有意义。现在，我们以去年十月份的四个星期天为例，看看他是怎样度过的。
    第一个星期天：吃完早饭，年四旺就坐在床边学习《为人民服务》。他回想入伍以来的思想和工作情况，深深地感到自己能取得一点成绩，都是按照毛主席教导办事的结果。有时候思想有波动，工作出了漏子，都是因为没听毛主席的话。毛主席的书一时一刻都离不了，越读越爱读。他在“学习笔记”上记下了这样一首诗：
    毛主席著作天天读，心红眼亮不迷路。
    毛主席著作天天读，革命干劲鼓得足。
    毛主席著作天天读，天大困难能克服。
    毛主席著作天天读，是非分明能抗毒。
    毛主席著作天天读，牛鬼蛇神全扫除。
    一辈子读毛主席的书，
    一辈子走毛主席指引的路。
    第二个、第三个星期天：一起床他就钻到伙房去找活干。他对炊事班同志说：不用客气，有什么活就交给我吧。只见他切菜、淘米、烧火，放下菜刀又拿起水桶，忙得连汗也顾不得擦。炊事班的同志怕累着他，说：“你辛苦了，休息一会儿再干吧！”他边干活边说：“要说辛苦，还是你们辛苦。我干这点活算个啥！”
    最后一个星期天：他把屋里屋外的卫生打扫干净以后，又挑来一担水给班里同志洗床单。战友们回来见床单洗得白白净净，好长时间不知道是年四旺洗的。
    年四旺的星期天是紧张的，也是愉快的。他象伟大的战士雷锋一样，把有限的生命投入到无限的为人民服务之中去了。
    新的起点
    一个月抬石头的任务快结束了，年四旺的肩膀肿了，腿疼了，腰痠了。今天年四旺来工地，闷着头，不唱歌，也不说笑。
    在工地参加劳动的指导员，看见这个情况，快步撵上年四旺，笑着说：“小年真行啊，我紧赶也撵不上你。”
    年四旺憨厚地笑了笑。
    “小年，累吗？”
    年四旺不在意地回答：“没什么，咬咬牙就过去了！”说罢，扛着扁担就跑了。
    收工之后，指导员又找年四旺谈心。他亲切地说：“小年，为人民服务要全心全意，干革命要自觉干。革命的道路长得很，我们的责任重得很，咬牙干革命能干好吗？肯定不能。”
    指导员说到这里，指着身边的小杨树，意味深长地说：“这些小杨树，离开了阳光雨露就不能成长。革命战士不用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，革命就没有方向，就要走到邪路上去。小年啊！这咬着牙关背后隐藏着什么？”最后，指导员还嘱咐小年：“认真学习‘老三篇’，对照一下自己，好好在思想里挖一挖。”
    这天夜晚，年四旺翻来复去不能入睡。他反复思考指导员语重心长的话。十一点钟了，他从枕头下拿出《为人民服务》，一骨碌翻身坐起，借着外屋从门缝射到床头的一线灯光，贪婪地读起来。年四旺的目光久久地停在这几行闪光的字句上：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”多么亲切的话啊！毛主席的教导照亮了年四旺的心。他回忆自己走过的这段路：抬了一个月石头，表面上干得不错，思想深处却隐藏着个“私”字。自己嫌工程兵天天和石头打交道，又累又苦，这就是“私”字作怪！想到这里，他自言自语地说：“不能带着‘私’字干革命，要去掉‘私’字，自觉干革命，我一定把这作为新的起点。”
    打进攻战
    盛夏时节，骄阳似火，烤得大地发烫。连队正紧张地搬运沥青枕木。沥青侵蚀皮肤发疼，年四旺眉头不皱，气不喘，扛起油渍渍的枕木飞也似地奔跑。扛了三天，全连数他扛的枕木最多，也数他的脖子、脸面爆皮最厉害。
    第四天，年四旺来到工地，看见还有那么一大堆枕木，心想：“什么时候才能扛完呀？”这个念头只在脑子里一闪，他马上就批评自己：“好，怕累怕疼，怕困难了！‘私’字抬头了，打下去，坚决把它打下去！向困难低头，就是向‘私’字屈服。”这时他想到毛主席的教导：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”于是高声朗读着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他振作起精神，扛起枕木，飞快地奔跑起来。
    年四旺每和“私”字斗争一次，就和毛主席著作的感情深一层，拿起毛主席著作，就感到格外亲切，想到毛主席教导，工作干得就格外起劲。他说：“我一时一刻都不能离开毛主席著作。”
    副班长孙喜仁见他脸和脖子被沥青侵蚀烂得象抹了一层浆糊，从心眼里疼他。他想给年四旺换个轻点儿的活。
    年四旺想到毛主席的教导，青年人好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳，他懂得了累的意义，感到全身筋骨累得舒坦，心里甜蜜。他对班长说：“毛主席说‘革命不是请客吃饭’，斗‘私’字也是一场革命，不能文质彬彬，要有激烈的斗争才能行，扛枕木身上是累，肩膀是疼，可这思想得到了磨炼，对‘私’字是个狠狠的打击。”这响当当的话，句句象从钢板上敲出来的。
    在紧张的搬运枕木工地，他思想上摆开了战场，勇敢地与“私”字拚刺刀，主动地向“私”字进攻，他说得好：“‘私’字跟敌人一样，你进攻它，它也进攻你，你不进攻它，它也要进攻你。”一句话，歼灭“私”字，要主动，要打进攻战，要彻底消灭它！
    狠斗“私”字“一闪念”
    年四旺带着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，改造世界观，取得了很大成绩。大家选他为学习毛主席著作积极分子。于是，常常有同志请他介绍学习经验。年四旺每次介绍经验，都是大摆自己思想深处的“私”字，挖“私”字的根，从来不讲自己做过的好事。
    有一次，他在介绍学习经验的会上，讲了这样一件事：有一天踩草泥回来，他打了一盆热腾腾的洗脚水，转身回来，热水就没有了，一问，是一个同班战友用了。他很不高兴，嘴里嘟囔了几句。当年四旺想起毛主席的教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”立即觉得自己离毛主席的教导太远了。踩草泥回来，大家都要洗脸洗脚，但想到的只是自己要用水，没有想到同志们也要用水。心里只想到自己，对同志缺乏热忱，冷冷清清，漠不关心，这是“私”字作怪，多么不应该啊！年四旺第二天就向战友作了检讨，并说：“俺这个‘私’字，非搞臭它不可！”
    从那次以后，每次收工回来，年四旺的第一件事，就是给全班打洗脸水、洗脚水。战友周本贵感动地说：“年四旺思想上有一点私心杂念，就到处讲，要讲到‘私’字臭了才住嘴。我看这就是破私立公的经验。”大家也说：“对，年四旺斗‘私’字，标准就是高。”
    不断向“私”字开火
    塞外的冬天，北风呼呼，寒流滚滚，气温直线下降。
    连队正在进行紧张的收尾工程。脚手架上的铁丝绳，被风吹得呜呜响。年四旺登上脚手架，刚把手伸出来，冷风象快刀削了手指一样，他立即把手缩了一下。后来，才又鼓了鼓勇气，开始工作。
    工地上，念毛主席语录声，号子声，风声，交织成激昂的战斗曲。
    收工哨音响过，年四旺把工具收拾好，呵了呵手，抬头看见脚手架上的语录板，几行显目的金字映在眼前：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”从这条语录中，他受到了很大的启发，他想起刚才在脚手架上缩手的事，感到这是“私”字作怪，有“私”心不是小事，是个祸根，决不可以轻视它！联想到伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场激烈的阶级斗争，就是要保证我们的江山万代红，不让阶级敌人复辟。阶级斗争是如此，思想斗争也是如此。“私”字，你打退了它，它还会以各种形式改头换面出现，企图复辟。手一缩，就是“私”字复辟的信号，你怕冷缩一缩，它就得寸进尺，最后把你从脚手架上攻下来。多么狡猾隐蔽的敌人啊！他自言自语地说：“‘私’字想复辟，俺用‘公’字打倒你，专你的政，夺你的权！”
    六七级大风吼叫着，似乎要把大山卷走，风沙刮得人睁不开眼睛。踩草泥冻脚，他偏要去踩，脚趾头冻得象红萝卜，可是他脸上却淌着热腾腾的汗水。脚手架上风大，他刚踩完草泥，手持瓦刀，连蹦带跳，爬到十多米高的脚手架上砌砖。一阵风，几乎把他刮了下去。同志们担心他被大风刮倒，一再叫他下来。他响亮地回答：“现在正是时候，让我好好锻炼锻炼！”他带着彻底革命的决心，向“私”字示威！
