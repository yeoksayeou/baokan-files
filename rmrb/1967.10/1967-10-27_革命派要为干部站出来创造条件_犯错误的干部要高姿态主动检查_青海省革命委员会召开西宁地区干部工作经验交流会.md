The Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee held an experience-sharing meeting on cadre work in the Xining region from October 19 to 21, resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

At this meeting, participants carefully studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. Representatives from units where cadre work had been done well introduced their experiences in correctly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy. Some leading cadres who had participated in the revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs also shared their experiences in correctly handling their own issues and the mass movement. Participants paid special attention to the speech by the representative from the Hongwei First Machine Tool Factory, believing that the factory's cadre work had correctly and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and that their political and ideological work with cadres was solid and detailed, making them a worthy example to learn from.

The representative of the proletarian revolutionary faction from the Hongwei First Machine Tool Factory said in his speech that to do well in cadre work, the revolutionary faction must first arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, break down the "self" and establish the "public." Only by breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public" can one not treat cadres from the perspective of personal grudges or the interests of small groups, dare to protect revolutionary leading cadres without fear of being ridiculed as "new monarchists" or "new rightists," avoid falling into the trap of "doubt everything, overthrow everything" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and correctly recognize and handle cadres. Secondly, one must follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, conduct class analysis of cadres, conduct thorough investigations and research, and specifically analyze and differentiate among cadres who have made various mistakes. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Hongwei First Machine Tool Factory requires that for each cadre who has made a mistake, one must be clear about three things: first, whether the mistake is a one-time incident or pervasive throughout the cadre's entire history and work; second, whether the cadre made the mistake consciously or unconsciously, and the subjective and objective reasons for the mistake; third, whether the cadre insists on the mistake or is willing to correct it. Because the revolutionary faction of this factory seriously studied and implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, conducted a detailed class analysis and investigation of cadres, they not only dared to release a large number of general leading cadres but also dared to release the "number one" leading cadres of the factory who had made relatively serious mistakes. In this way, they thoroughly isolated the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, established a revolutionary committee with the three-in-one combination, and brought about a new situation in the factory's revolution and production.

The former Party Secretary of this factory, now a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee, had executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution and participated in the suppression of the revolutionary faction. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they analyzed his entire history and work over twenty-eight years of participation, analyzed the nature of his mistakes, and his understanding and correction of the mistakes. After careful analysis and research, it was concluded that before the Cultural Revolution, he had a lot of initiative and could uphold party principles; in this Cultural Revolution, although he made serious mistakes, he was not stubborn and unrepentant. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary faction warmly helped him make a self-criticism to the revolutionary masses, giving him the time and opportunity to "come out." With the help of the revolutionary faction, he actively went to the masses to make self-criticisms, going wherever there were criticisms of him, and working with the masses in the workshops, thus gaining the understanding of the masses.

Comrade Liu Xianquan, the head of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at this cadre work experience-sharing meeting.

Comrade Liu Xianquan said, our great leader Chairman Mao has recently given a series of extremely important instructions on cadre issues, which we must seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely implement. Comrade Liu Xianquan said, to do well in cadre work, we must solve problems from two aspects. On one hand, the proletarian revolutionary faction must correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and with a scientific attitude, conduct investigations and research on cadres, and make specific analyses. On the other hand, cadres who have made mistakes must take a high stance, be proactive, have the determination to correct mistakes, bravely come forward, believe in the masses, have a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility, and have a strong desire and actual actions to follow Chairman Mao for life and maintain the great cause of the proletarian revolution. In short, no matter which aspect, we must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "criticize the self, criticize revisionism," actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize selfish and impure thoughts, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, we will not have endless worries and can implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy without any omissions.

Comrade Liu Xianquan required the proletarian revolutionary faction to create conditions for more leading cadres to come forward. He said, we must support leading cadres in their revolutionary actions to "come out" to the masses, giving them the time and opportunity to "come out." Before some leading cadres make public self-criticisms at mass meetings, the proletarian revolutionary faction can organize some core members to hold small meetings, specifically helping them so that they can deeply touch the soul when making self-criticisms at large meetings. Comrade Liu Xianquan said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is the key to implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units. We must definitely solve this key problem." We must take "criticize the self, criticize revisionism" as the guideline, from the fundamental interests of the revolution, thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and the "left" in form, right in essence thought, and solve this key problem well.

Participants at this meeting included proletarian revolutionary faction warriors from various units in the Xining region, leading cadres at various levels, and PLA left-supporting personnel. They studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, listened to the introduction of advanced units' experiences, and found the gaps in their own thoughts and unit work according to Mao Zedong Thought, greatly promoting the work of implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy in the Xining region. This meeting was a successful three-in-one combination meeting.

    革命派要为干部站出来创造条件
    犯错误的干部要高姿态主动检查
    青海省革命委员会召开西宁地区干部工作经验交流会
    据新华社西宁二十六日电　青海省革命委员会于十月十九日到二十一日召开西宁地区干部工作经验交流会，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。
    在这次会议上，与会人员认真学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示。一些干部工作做得好的单位的无产阶级革命派代表，介绍了正确执行毛主席干部政策的经验。一些参加了革命三结合临时权力机构的领导干部，也介绍了正确对待自己、正确对待群众运动的体会。参加会议的同志特别重视青海红卫第一机床厂代表的发言，认为这个工厂在干部工作中坚决地正确地执行了毛主席的干部政策，对干部的政治思想工作做得扎实细致，是值得学习的好榜样。
    红卫第一机床厂无产阶级革命派代表在发言中说，要做好干部工作，首先革命派必须用毛泽东思想武装头脑，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。只有破私立公，才不会从个人恩怨或小团体的利益出发来对待干部，才敢于保革命的领导干部而不怕被人讽刺为“新保皇”、“新右倾”，才不会上中国赫鲁晓夫“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的当，才能正确地认识和对待干部。其次，要根据毛主席的一贯教导，对干部进行阶级分析，认真作调查研究，具体分析和区别对待犯有各种错误的干部。红卫第一机床厂的无产阶级革命派对每个犯有错误的干部，都要求做到“三清楚”：一、分清楚他的错误是属于一时一事还是贯穿在他的全部历史、全部工作中；二、分清楚干部犯错误是自觉的还是不自觉的，以及犯错误的主观原因和客观原因；三、分清楚他是坚持错误还是愿意改正错误。这个厂的革命派由于认真地学习和贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，对干部作了仔细的阶级分析和调查研究，因此他们不但敢于解放一大批一般的领导干部，而且敢于解放犯过比较严重错误的厂里领导干部中的“第一把手”。这样，就彻底孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，建立了三结合的革命委员会，使全厂革命和生产都出现了崭新的局面。
    这个厂的原党委书记、现任革命委员会常委，在文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，参与过镇压革命派的活动。无产阶级革命派掌权后，分析了他参加工作二十八年的全部历史和全部工作，分析了他的错误性质，以及他对所犯错误的认识程度和改正情况。大家经过认真的分析研究，认为他在文化大革命以前，干劲较足，能坚持党的原则；在这次文化大革命中，他虽然犯了严重错误，但还不是坚持不改、屡教不改的，对他应当采取团结教育的方针。因此，无产阶级革命派就热情地帮助他向革命群众作检查，给他“亮相”的时间和机会。他在革命派的帮助下，主动到群众中去检查，哪里对他有意见，就到哪里去，并到车间同群众一起参加劳动，从而取得了群众的谅解。
    青海省革命委员会主任刘贤权同志在这次干部工作经验交流会上讲了话。
    刘贤权同志说，伟大的领袖毛主席最近对干部问题做了一系列极为重要的指示，我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，坚决贯彻执行。刘贤权同志说，做好干部工作必须从两方面来解决问题。一方面，无产阶级革命派要正确地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，要以科学的态度对干部进行调查研究，具体分析。另一方面，犯有错误的干部要高姿态，要主动，要有改正错误的决心，要勇敢地站出来，要相信群众，要有强烈的革命责任感，要有一辈子紧跟毛主席，一辈子保持无产阶级革命大节的强烈愿望和实际行动。总之，不论那一方面，都要遵循毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大教导，活学活用毛主席著作，斗掉私心杂念，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这样，就不会顾虑重重，就能不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策。
    刘贤权同志要求无产阶级革命派要为更多的领导干部站出来创造条件。他说，要支持领导干部到群众中去“亮相”的革命行动，要给他们“亮相”的时间和机会。在有的领导干部到群众大会上作公开检查以前，无产阶级革命派可以组织一些骨干先开小会，具体帮助他们，使他们在大会上检查时能深刻地触及灵魂。刘贤权同志说，毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”我们必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，从革命的根本利益出发，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线和形“左”实右的思想影响，把这个关键问题解决好。
    参加这次会议的有西宁地区各单位的无产阶级革命派战士，各级领导干部和解放军支左人员。他们在会上共同学习毛主席的最新指示，听取先进单位的经验介绍，共同按照毛泽东思想找自己思想上和本单位工作中的差距，把西宁地区贯彻执行毛主席干部政策的工作大大推进了一步。这次会议是一次成功的三结合的会议。
