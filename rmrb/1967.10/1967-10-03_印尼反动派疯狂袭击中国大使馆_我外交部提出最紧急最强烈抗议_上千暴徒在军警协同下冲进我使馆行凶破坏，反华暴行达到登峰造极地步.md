    Indonesian Reactionaries Launch Frenzied Attack on Chinese Embassy
    Chinese Foreign Ministry Issues Urgent and Strongest Protest
    Over a Thousand Rioters, with Military and Police Support, Storm Embassy, Commit Atrocities and Vandalism; Anti-China Violence Reaches Extreme

    Xinhua News Agency, October 1st: The responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Indonesian Embassy in China, Darwoto, this afternoon to lodge the most urgent and strongest protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the Indonesian armed forces in collusion with rioters, who once again launched a frenzied attack and vandalized the Chinese Embassy, injuring Chinese diplomatic personnel.

    The responsible official pointed out: According to foreign news agencies, from 3:00 AM to 8:30 AM on October 1st, the Indonesian reactionary government once again instigated over a thousand rioters, with the support of armed military and police, to ram the gates of the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta with trucks, storming into the compound and carrying out a frenzied attack. The rioters, armed with clubs, knives, and other weapons, savagely assaulted and beat Chinese diplomatic personnel. At least nine Chinese diplomatic personnel were seriously injured. The rioters also looted, smashed, and burned various equipment, communication devices, furniture, and documents in the embassy. Seven embassy cars were also set on fire. Particularly serious was the fact that the rioters tore down the Chinese national flag, burned it, and hoisted the Indonesian national flag in the embassy compound.

    The responsible official sternly pointed out: The Indonesian Suharto-Nasution reactionary government's anti-China atrocities have reached an extreme, fully exposing your plot to completely sabotage the relationship between the two countries. Your deliberate choice to commit this fascist atrocity on the great national holiday of the Chinese people—the National Day—is an even more serious provocation to the 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese government and people, with indignation, sternly warn the Indonesian reactionary government: You have repeatedly launched armed attacks on the Chinese Embassy, shamelessly trampled on international norms, and wantonly violated the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy. You must bear full responsibility for this fascist crime and all its consequences. You must immediately stop the attacks, vandalism, and all provocations against the Chinese Embassy. The safety of the Chinese Embassy and its personnel must be fully guaranteed by the Indonesian government. Due to the complete disruption of communication between the Chinese Embassy and the mainland, the Chinese government has not yet received a detailed report on the attack on the embassy and its personnel. The Chinese government reserves the right to take further measures.

    我外交部提出最紧急最强烈抗议
    上千暴徒在军警协同下冲进我使馆行凶破坏，反华暴行达到登峰造极地步
    新华社一日讯　中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人今天下午紧急召见印尼驻华大使馆临时代办达尔渥多，就印尼武装部队伙同暴徒再一次疯狂袭击和破坏中国大使馆、打伤中国外交人员的法西斯暴行，提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。
    第一亚洲司负责人指出：据外国通讯社报道，十月一日凌晨三时到八时三十分，印尼反动政府再一次指使一千多名暴徒，在武装军警的协同下，用卡车撞开雅加达中国大使馆的大门，冲进馆内进行了疯狂袭击。暴徒们手持棍棒、刀子等利器，野蛮行凶，围攻毒打中国外交人员，至少有九名中国外交人员受重伤。暴徒们还抢劫、砸毁和焚烧大使馆的各种设备、通讯器材、家具和文件档案。大使馆的七部汽车也被纵火焚烧。尤其严重的是，暴徒们竟然扯下中国国旗，加以焚毁，并在大使馆院内扯起印尼国旗。
    第一亚洲司负责人严正指出：印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动政府这一反华暴行达到了登峰造极的地步，充分暴露了你们蓄意彻底破坏两国关系的阴谋。你们特意选择在中国人民的伟大节日——国庆节，制造这一法西斯暴行，这更是对七亿中国人民的最严重挑衅。中国政府和中国人民怀着无比愤怒的心情，最严重地警告印尼反动政府：你们一次又一次地武装袭击中国大使馆，肆无忌惮地蹂躏了国际关系准则，疯狂侵犯中国大使馆的外交特权，你们必须对这一法西斯罪行及其一切后果承担全部责任。你们必须立即停止对中国大使馆的袭击、破坏和一切挑衅。中国大使馆及其人员的安全必须由印尼政府负完全的责任。由于中国大使馆同国内的联系已经完全中断，中国政府还未接到大使馆及其人员遭受袭击的详细报告，中国政府保留采取进一步措施的权利。
