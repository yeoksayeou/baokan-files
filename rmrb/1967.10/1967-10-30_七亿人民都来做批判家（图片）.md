	All 700 million people become critics
	Broad masses of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight selfishness." The articles published here today are examples of workers, peasants, and soldiers using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize "China's Khrushchev" while simultaneously waging a struggle against the "self" in their own minds.

	The "eat small losses to gain big benefits" and "without personal interests there are no collective interests" that China's Khrushchev advocates are, in the final analysis, advocacy of "self" and opposition to "public." "Self" is the core of the bourgeois worldview, and "public" is the soul of the proletarian worldview. China's Khrushchev, under the banner of the public interest, seeks personal gain; under the banner of communism, he engages in capitalist activities. He spreads capitalist poison to try to numb the broad masses and achieve his evil goal of usurping the Party and the state and restoring capitalism. We must thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary and decadent bourgeois worldview. Criticizing revisionism also helps us to fight selfishness. We must closely link the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    七亿人民都来做批判家
    广大工农兵革命群众，正在以实际行动热烈响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召。今天这里发表的几篇文章，就是工农兵同志用毛泽东思想为武器，在狠斗自己头脑中“私”字的同时，对中国赫鲁晓夫进行的有力批判。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的什么“吃小亏占大便宜”，“没有个人利益就没有集体利益”等等，归根到底就是鼓吹一个“私”字，反对一个“公”字。“私”是资产阶级世界观的核心，“公”是无产阶级世界观的灵魂。中国赫鲁晓夫打着为公的旗号，去捞取个人的私利；打着共产主义的旗号，去干资本主义的勾当。他大肆散布资本主义的毒素，妄图麻痹广大群众，达到他篡党篡国，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们必须彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反动腐朽的资产阶级世界观。狠狠批修，也有助于我们更好地斗私。我们一定要把斗私和批修紧密联系起来，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！　·编者·
