The British Empire follows the American Empire's brazen anti-China face exposed

The British authorities in Hong Kong openly condone the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Hong Kong to hold false celebrations

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 9th, recently, while the British authorities in Hong Kong were frantically sabotaging the activities of Hong Kong patriots celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, they also openly condoned the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Hong Kong to hold false celebrations on the occasion of the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. This is part of the British authorities in Hong Kong's consistent plot to follow the U.S. imperialists in playing the "two Chinas" political trick, fully exposing their anti-China ugly face.

In recent days, the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Hong Kong, with the connivance and encouragement of the British authorities in Hong Kong, have been carrying out so-called "Double Ten National Day" activities under the stinky banner of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. According to the pseudo "Central News Agency," the British authorities in Hong Kong have allowed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to hold a reception on the 10th, "inviting relevant government officials and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Hong Kong" to attend. The British authorities in Hong Kong also condone the Chiang Kai-shek clique in setting up so-called "celebration arches" and hanging the flags of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which have long been spat upon by the Chinese people, as well as carrying out anti-China propaganda.

The British authorities in Hong Kong's plot to create "two Chinas" is a consistent manifestation of their hostility towards the great People's Republic of China. In recent years, the British authorities in Hong Kong have been particularly active in carrying out such plots, with their high-ranking officials openly engaging in official contacts with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Facts over the years have shown that the British authorities in Hong Kong, disregarding the opposition of the Chinese people, have been brazenly following the U.S. imperialists in plotting to create "two Chinas," making themselves enemies of the 700 million Chinese people. Hong Kong patriots warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: the British authorities' serious political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people will inevitably receive the punishment they deserve.

    英帝追随美帝猖狂反华丑恶面目的大暴露
    港英公然纵容香港的蒋帮分子搞伪庆活动
    据新华社香港九日电　最近，港英当局在疯狂破坏香港爱国同胞庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年活动的同时，又公然纵容香港的蒋匪帮分子，借辛亥革命纪念日大搞伪庆活动。这是港英当局一贯追随美帝国主义玩弄“两个中国”政治阴谋的一个组成部分，充分暴露了它的反华丑恶面目。
    最近几天以来，香港的蒋匪帮分子，在港英当局的纵容和鼓励下，抬着蒋介石匪帮的臭招牌大搞所谓“双十国庆”活动。据伪“中央社”供认，港英当局默许蒋匪帮分子在十日举行酒会，“柬请本港有关政府官员、驻港各国外交使节”参加。港英当局还纵容蒋匪帮分子搭起所谓“庆祝牌楼”和张挂早已为中国人民所唾弃的蒋匪帮旗帜，以及大搞反华宣传。
    港英当局制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋活动，是它一贯敌视伟大的中华人民共和国的表现。最近几年来，港英当局特别起劲地进行这种阴谋活动，它的高级官员公然与蒋匪帮分子作官式接触。
    多年来的事实表明，港英当局不顾中国人民的反对，肆无忌惮地追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，与七亿中国人民为敌。香港爱国同胞警告港英当局：港英当局对七亿中国人民的严重政治挑衅，必将受到应得的惩罚。
