The ship of New China, under the guidance of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world, has proudly sailed for eighteen years of victory.

On this grand occasion, all of China, all the world, is watching Beijing, listening to the voice of Beijing.

Red books shine under the sun; red flags flutter in the blue sky. The vast army of the proletarian cultural revolution, like a raging fire, like a surging tide, with hearts aflame, all turn towards the reddest sun.

At ten o'clock, to the tune of "The East is Red," our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum.

The red sun shines over the world, and the spring thunder roars. People shout with all their hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! We wish our reddest sun in our hearts eternal life! Eternal life!

Our great leader Chairman Mao is in extremely good health and has boundless energy. This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China, the greatest happiness for all the people of the world!

The Tiananmen Square has become a boiling ocean. Ten thousand people formed a magnificent scene with bouquets of flowers spelling out "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," and "Long Live the Cultural Revolution," vividly expressing the wishes of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

On the eve of the festival, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions and today celebrated the national day with the revolutionary people of the capital. This is the greatest concern and encouragement from the great leader to hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses.

Throughout the long march of the Chinese revolution, in those difficult years, at crucial moments of complex class struggle, it was always our great teacher who stood at the forefront of the times, pointing the way and leading to victory. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at every important juncture, it was also our great teacher who put forward wise strategic measures, guiding hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to advance along the correct line to victory.

The parade carried forward the giant sculptures of the great leaders of the international communist movement, Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and Mao Zedong, enthusiastically hailing three great milestones in the development of Marxism.

People cheer for the world entering the new era of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has scientifically summarized the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship at home and abroad, especially studied the bitter lessons of the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, and brilliantly and creatively proposed the great theory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With unparalleled great courage, he personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great strategic measure in the international communist movement.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the greatest revolutionary transformation that humanity has never experienced, a revolution deeper and more tumultuous than the Paris Commune and the October Revolution. It is the first revolution in a proletarian dictatorship state initiated by the proletariat itself. Hundreds of millions of people have been mobilized. No mass movement has ever been as extensive and deep as this one. Last August 18, Chairman Mao said: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses, which has great significance for the ideological revolution of the entire nation."

Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment has led this cultural revolution from victory to victory. The May 16, 1966, Circular of the Central Committee sounded the advance signal for this cultural revolution. Chairman Mao's great call to "Bombard the Headquarters" mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

More than a year ago, the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, could still rely on their power to formulate and implement a reactionary bourgeois line. Today, they have collapsed, and they have been beaten to pieces, suffering a complete collapse.

Last year at this time, under the white terror of the reactionary bourgeois line, many "little people" were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." Today, they have stood up, marching proudly in the parade, shouting victory.

The red storm of the "January Revolution" that began in Shanghai swept across the country. The red plumes of Taihang Mountain were raised high, the waves of Bohai Bay surged, the spring thunder of the Southwest shook the sky, the new dawn rose in the Northeast, and the red flags rolled over the Qinghai Plateau. The victory songs of Mao Zedong Thought, one after another, shook the world!

The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee made the great capital of our motherland a shining school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Today, the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat in the capital, with proud steps, powerful songs, and bountiful harvests, demonstrated the great power of the new proletarian state, accepting the inspection of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and Vice Commander Lin Biao.

Pick up the pen, make it a spear. The Red Guards brandished their big pens, marching forward bravely and proudly. The broad revolutionary masses responded to Chairman Mao's battle call, launching a high tide of mass revolutionary criticism.

Chairman Mao's latest directive on revolutionary great alliance is like a spring breeze, spreading across the country. The working class takes the lead. In a short period, under the principle of revolution, thousands of revolutionary organizations of the masses realized the great alliance of revolution.

Today, revolutionary fighters from various sectors of the proletariat, with orderly steps, gathered in the great ranks of revolutionary great alliance, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, passing through Tiananmen Square. Under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, they merged into the vast army of the cultural revolution.

This is the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment!

This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The people, only the people, are the motive force that creates world history.

The army of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought marches forward on the red Chang'an Street. They are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the masters of the Mao Zedong era.

A giant model of a locomotive rolls forward, with the words "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress" written by Comrade Lin Biao in person!

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is pushing history to leap forward!

The stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have washed away the filth and mud on the land of our motherland, making the socialist vast land even more beautiful.

The stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have washed away the dust and dirt in people's minds, making the spiritual face of hundreds of millions of people in our country completely renewed.

Today, in border and coastal outposts, in remote mountainous areas, in factories, schools, and everywhere, a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has been launched, creating a new era where workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is becoming the unified ideology of 700 million people.

The realization of ideological revolution by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses is the most reliable guarantee for our socialist mountains and rivers to remain unchanged for thousands of years.

When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will become the most selfless, the bravest, and the wisest.

The crew of the "South Sea Hero Ship" No. 1018 came to Chairman Mao's side. They are a heroic collective that emerged during the Cultural Revolution while carrying out the task of aiding Vietnam and fighting America. What power enabled them to overcome enemy air raids? What power enabled them to overcome fierce winds and waves? What power enabled them to endure the days and nights on a deserted island? It is the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The heroes proudly said:

"Invincible Mao Zedong Thought is more important than weapons in battle; more precious than food when hungry; warmer than fire when cold; more effective than medicine when injured."

The heroes longed for the day when they could come to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. This wish has finally been realized. They feel that they are the happiest people in the world.

The Shanghai Workers' Joy Brigade brought the heartfelt wishes of the Shanghai working class to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao! It is you who guided us to rise up and wage a power struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road; it is you who guided us to see through and smash the plots of counter-revolutionary economism, defending the great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production." Revolution on the spot, part-time revolution, frugal revolution. In the extraordinary September, we followed your great strategic deployment and launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great alliance.

Chairman Mao! The working class of Shanghai will forever follow you! The working class of the whole country will forever follow you!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further liberated the productive forces. The revolutionary workers of the capital's coal mines, railways, steel, machinery, construction, and financial sectors today all sent revolutionary and production reports to Chairman Mao.

Look at Tiananmen Square, the red flags roll up a thousand waves; look at the land of the motherland, the rice waves gather into a million waves. This year, all crops in the country have a bumper harvest, everything has a bumper harvest. Many crops have exceeded the highest levels in the history of the country or since its founding, achieving a continuous six-year bumper harvest.

Today, famous agricultural labor models from across the country, Chen Yonggui and Deng Wantian, responsible for the Beijing Municipal Farmers' Congress, are on the Tiananmen Rostrum, discussing the excellent situation in rural areas across the country and exchanging revolutionary combat experience. They, by the side of Chairman Mao, expressed their determination: resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao to quickly set up Chairman Mao's works study classes in rural areas, further and more extensively carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary criticism, highlight proletarian politics, and strive to achieve "six goods" in agriculture, seizing a double harvest of revolution and production.

One shining hero after another appears before us. Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red flag of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, led the revolutionary pioneers in the literary and artistic circles to forge ahead and establish the eight model revolutionary operas, such as "The Red Lantern," turning the upside-down history back to the right side, and blooming the brilliant flowers of proletarian literature and art. In the Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary fighters in the literary and artistic circles have advanced along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art. The days when the Chinese Khrushchev stubbornly defended the stage ruled by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties are gone forever. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only the masters of the political stage but also the masters of the literary and artistic stage.

The revolutionary Red Guards are advancing!

The Red Guard movement just emerged from the eastern horizon, and Chairman Mao warmly instructed the revolutionary youngsters: The proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all mankind!

Today, the broad revolutionary Red Guards have united and combined under Chairman Mao's great call. They are determined to combine with workers and peasants for life, following Chairman Mao's teachings, guiding petty-bourgeois ideology onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat, and tempering themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause!

On the Tiananmen Rostrum, the Red Guard youngsters today once again gathered around our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao smiled and shook hands with them, talking. They excitedly promised to him:

"We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's latest call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism; to do new deeds for the people and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!"

"There is no everything for the people without a people's army." These seventeen big characters shine in the parade.

The People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is a unique, unparalleled proletarian army that is both militarily and culturally proficient, a great iron wall!

This iron wall of the People's Liberation Army was personally built by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. This wall was built with the blood and lives of countless revolutionary martyrs. This wall, after experiencing the fierce struggle between the proletarian military line and the bourgeois military line of Chairman Mao, and the storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become even more indestructible!

This iron wall is a defense against imperialist aggression, safeguarding our national defense security. This iron wall is a consolidation of our proletarian dictatorship, safeguarding the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Heroic soldiers firmly defend the gates of the motherland, giving a crushing blow to all daring invaders, supporting and promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. They have established new glorious historical achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." At Chairman Mao's order, thousands of troops immediately took action. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly supporting the revolutionary leftists, uniting with the broad masses, and bravely charging against the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road. Among them, many advanced collectives have emerged. This year, Xie Chen's brother, Xie Qi, the former class leader of Xie Chen, and all his classmates, while supporting agriculture in Dazhai Brigade, firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary fighters represented by Comrade Chen Yonggui when the class enemies stirred up a black wind, defending the red flag personally raised by Chairman Mao.

Comrades from the "support left" frontline said: "Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support." The heroic soldiers formed millions of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, active on streets, fields, and workshops, spreading Chairman Mao's voice to every corner of the motherland. Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School was once a point where the Chinese Khrushchev directly implemented the reactionary bourgeois line. The comrades who conducted military training here firmly established Mao Zedong Thought and, together with revolutionary teachers and students, thoroughly criticized the reactionary bourgeois line. The revolutionary youngsters said well: "The Chinese Khrushchev divided us into pieces, and the comrades of the PLA united us again with Mao Zedong Thought."

Revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised the PLA for listening to Chairman Mao's words, doing as Chairman Mao said.

When revolutionary youngsters were persecuted under the white terror, it was the PLA that stood up and resolutely supported them.

When the class enemies stirred up the evil wind of economism, it was the PLA that, together with the proletarian revolutionary fighters, shouldered the double burden of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production."

When the malicious elements stirred up armed struggles, it was the PLA that, with the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," patiently persuaded the masses and bravely stopped the armed struggles.

When the two classes engaged in a life-and-death struggle, it was the PLA that helped the revolutionary masses follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle.

The parade carried the giant banner "Support the Army, Love the People," marching forward with heads held high. In the days and nights of arduous struggle, the People's Liberation Army and the broad revolutionary masses, shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, fish and water, flesh and blood, forged a deep combat friendship. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses deeply experienced in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: Without the people's army, there would be no strong proletarian dictatorship, no great democracy of socialism, no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and no such unprecedented good situation today. They said: Where in the world is there such a good army? Whoever opposes our pillar of proletarian dictatorship, we will not agree!

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "The surging mass movement, in turn, greatly inspired and educated the army, becoming a revolutionary crucible for tempering and raising the political awareness of the army."

Comrades from the "three supports, two militaries" frontline deeply felt this: The frontline of "three supports, two militaries" is a big classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Here, contradictions are the sharpest, struggles are the most complex, teaching materials are the richest, teachers are the most skilled, and souls are most touched. They said well: "Class struggle tempers the will, and the cultural revolution crucible forges red hearts."

All military personnel and soldiers firmly respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, achieving new levels in learning and applying in the "three supports, two militaries" and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have become stronger in the class struggle.

The army and the people are united as one, see who can defeat us!

The great iron wall of the People's Liberation Army, under the sun of boundless Mao Zedong Thought, stands majestically in the East! It is the iron wall of the Chinese people! It is the iron wall of the revolutionary people of the world!

The majestic song "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman" soars high in the capital's sky. Our great helmsman is Chairman Mao. Our vast sea is the sea of class struggle, the sea of revolutionary struggle.

Red flags are as dense as forests, and the five continents are in jubilation. On the Tiananmen Rostrum, which is watched by the world, the majestic figure of Chairman Mao is the solemn image of the great helmsman. You led us to fight the most arduous, most intense, most prolonged, and most complex struggle in world history, welcoming the great victory of the Chinese revolution.

Our wise helmsman Chairman Mao corrected the course of world revolution, breaking through the waves of evil raised by the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet traitor clique, and the reactionaries of various countries, guiding the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world to advance courageously on the road to human liberation!

Great helmsman Chairman Mao! We, the people of the whole country, love you, believe in you, worship you, and are loyal to you without limit! On the Tiananmen Rostrum and the viewing platform, there are commanders of the People's Liberation Army who have experienced countless battles and marched ten thousand miles. They followed Chairman Mao from Jinggang Mountain to the Dadu River, from Baota Mountain to Beijing. In every important historical period, they followed the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao closely. A high-ranking commander of the PLA who followed Chairman Mao to Jinggang Mountain deeply felt from his forty-year combat career: "The Chinese revolution deviates from Chairman Mao's course and will definitely suffer setbacks; following Chairman Mao's course, victories will come one after another. Following Chairman Mao is victory, this is the summary of history."

Chairman Mao cares most about cadres, cherishes cadres the most, and pays the most attention to helping cadres politically and ideologically. Last year, when Chairman Mao inspected the cultural revolution army for the seventh time, he told the cadres: "You should put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." Today, on the Tiananmen Rostrum, the great leader had a cordial talk with an old comrade who had made many achievements. This comrade excitedly said: I will follow Chairman Mao for life, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and revolution to the end!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has sowed the seeds of revolution throughout the world. Revolutionary people of the world, from the greatest revolutionary transformation in human history, have seen their own future, seen the brilliant spring of mankind.

On the viewing platform, friends from the five continents and we together celebrate the brilliant holiday of the Chinese people, hail the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and hail the world entering the new era of great Mao Zedong Thought. Heroic Albanian comrades from the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist front, with deep affection, said: "Although Albania and China are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, great Mao Zedong has connected us. We always look up to the East, singing the loudest song 'The East is Red.'"

The revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Japanese Gearza, who are visiting and performing in China, held up the red banner with the words "Long Live Great Mao Zedong Thought" and sang the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations in Chinese. They said: "China's today is our tomorrow! Following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, this is the conclusion of all the people of the world."

The masses holding flowers on the square surged towards Tiananmen, surged towards our most beloved and respected Chairman Mao.

Respected Chairman Mao! We pledge to you: We will definitely follow your great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of revolutionary struggle, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and make the whole country a school of Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely build China into the strongest and most solid base of world revolution, resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Big winds and waves are not to be feared. Human society has developed from big winds and waves." We will definitely follow the revolutionary course opened by you, bravely advance against the big winds and waves of class struggle!

Let those imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries who sense their doom tremble before our great motherland, the revolutionary tide will bury them completely!

The future belongs to us!

Victory belongs to us!

    人类历史上最伟大的革命变革
    新中国的航船，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，豪迈地走过了十八年的胜利航程。
    在这盛大的节日里，全中国，全世界，都注视着北京，倾听着北京的声音。
    红书，在太阳下闪光；红旗，在蓝天里飞扬。浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，象烈火，象海潮，颗颗红心向着最红最红的红太阳。
    十时正，在《东方红》的乐曲声中，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志登上了天安门城楼。
    红日照寰宇，春雷动地来。人们尽情地欢呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛。这是全中国人民的最大幸福，这是全世界人民的最大幸福！
      伟　大　的　战　略
    天安门广场成了沸腾的海洋。十万人用花束组成的“毛主席万岁”“毛泽东思想万岁”“文化大革命万岁”的壮丽图景，生动地表达了亿万革命人民的心愿。
    节日前夕，我们伟大领袖毛主席，视察了华北、中南和华东地区，今天又同首都革命人民一起欢度国庆。这是伟大领袖对亿万革命群众的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。
    在中国革命的漫长征途中，在那艰苦的岁月里，在阶级斗争错综复杂的关键时刻，总是我们的伟大导师站在时代的前头，指明道路，引向胜利；在无产阶级文化大革命中，在每一个重要的关头，也总是我们的伟大导师提出英明的战略措施，引导着亿万革命群众，沿着正确的路线，胜利前进。
    游行队伍高举着国际共产主义运动伟大导师马克思和恩格斯、列宁和斯大林、毛泽东的巨大浮雕像前进，最热烈地欢呼马克思主义发展史上三个伟大的里程碑。
    人们欢呼世界进入伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，科学地总结了国际和我国无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是研究了苏联出现资本主义全面复辟的惨痛教训，天才地、创造性地提出了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大理论。他以无比的巨大魄力，亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这是国际共产主义运动的伟大的战略措施。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上从未经历过的最伟大的革命变革，是比巴黎公社、十月革命更深刻、更汹涌澎湃的大革命，是在无产阶级专政的国家内，由无产阶级自己发动的第一次大革命。亿万人民发动起来了。从来的群众运动也没有象这次运动发动得这样广泛和深入。去年八月十八日，毛主席就说：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    毛主席的伟大战略部署，把这场文化大革命从胜利引向胜利。中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，吹响了这场文化大革命的进军号。毛主席《炮打司令部》的伟大号召，动员亿万革命人民向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起了猛烈攻击。
    一年多以前，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，还能够依仗他们的权势，制订和推行一条资产阶级反动路线。今天，他们垮台了，他们被打得落花流水，全面崩溃。
    去年此时，在资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖下，许多“小人物”被打成“反革命”。今年他们翻身了，他们在游行的行列中，昂首前进，欢呼胜利。
    从上海开始的“一月革命”的红色风暴，席卷全国。太行山红缨高举，渤海湾卷起巨浪，西南春雷震长空，东北升起新曙光，青海高原红旗漫卷，……毛泽东思想的凯歌，一曲又一曲，震撼了世界！
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，使伟大祖国的首都，成为闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的大学校。
    今天，首都无产阶级革命派的队伍，以豪迈的步伐，雄壮的歌声，丰收的硕果，显示了新生的无产阶级政权的巨大威力，接受了我们伟大统帅毛主席和林彪副统帅的检阅。
    拿起笔，作刀枪。红卫兵小将挥舞着大笔，雄赳赳，气昂昂，阔步前进。广大革命群众响应毛主席的战斗号令，掀起了群众性的革命大批判的高潮。
    毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示，犹如春风，传遍全国。工人阶级一马当先。千百万革命群众的战斗组织，在短短的时间里，在革命的原则下，实现了革命的大联合。
    今天，来自各行各业的无产阶级革命派战士，以整齐的步伐，集结在革命大联合的伟大行列里，肩并肩，手挽手地通过天安门广场。在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，汇合成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。
    这是毛主席伟大战略部署的光辉胜利！
    这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
      时　代　的　主　人
      “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵大军，在红色的长安街大道上阔步前进。他们是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，是毛泽东时代的主人。
    一台巨大的火车头模型滚滚向前，上面镶嵌着林彪同志亲笔题词：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”！
    在毛泽东思想指引下的无产阶级文化大革命，推动着历史飞跃前进！
    无产阶级文化大革命的急风骤雨，涤荡了祖国大地上的污泥浊水，使社会主义的万里江山分外妖娆。
    无产阶级文化大革命的急风骤雨，涤荡了人们头脑里的灰尘污垢，使我国亿万人民的精神面貌焕然一新。
    今天，在边防海防的哨所，在偏僻山区的地头，在厂矿、学校，到处掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，开创了工农兵群众直接掌握和运用毛泽东思想的伟大新时代。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，正在成为七亿人民的统一思想。
    亿万革命群众实现思想革命化，这是我们社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色的最可靠的保证。
    人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就会变得最无私，最勇敢，最聪明。
    一○一八号“南海英雄船”的船员们，来到毛主席身边。他们是文化大革命中执行援越抗美任务时涌现出来的英雄集体。什么力量使他们战胜了敌机轰炸？什么力量使他们战胜了险风恶浪？又是什么力量使他们度过了荒岛上的日日夜夜？是伟大的毛泽东思想。
    英雄们豪迈地说：
    “战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在战斗中比武器更重要；在饥饿的时候比粮食更宝贵；在寒冷的时候比火更温暖；在伤痛的时候比药物更灵验。”
    英雄们盼望着有那么一天：到北京来见毛主席。这个愿望终于实现了。他们感到自己是世界上最幸福最幸福的人。
    上海工人报喜队，带来了上海工人阶级对最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的衷心祝愿。
    毛主席啊毛主席！是您指引我们起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开夺权斗争；是您指引我们识破和粉碎了反革命经济主义的阴谋毒计，捍卫了“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命。在不平凡的九月里，我们紧跟您的伟大战略部署，掀起了革命大批判和革命大联合的高潮。
    毛主席啊毛主席！上海的工人阶级永远跟着您！全国的工人阶级永远跟着您！
    无产阶级文化大革命，进一步解放了生产力。首都的煤矿、铁路、钢铁、机械、建筑、财贸等各条战线的革命职工，今天都向毛主席送来了革命的喜报，生产的喜报。
    看天安门前，红旗卷起千重浪；望祖国大地，稻谷汇成万顷波。今年，全国农作物普遍丰收，样样丰收。许多作物产量超过建国以来或历史上的最高水平，获得了连续六年的大丰收。
    今天，全国著名的农业劳动模范陈永贵和北京市农代会负责人邓万田，在天安门城楼上，畅谈全国农村大好形势，交流革命斗争经验。他们在毛主席身边互表决心：坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，要在农村迅速开办毛主席著作学习班，把活学活用毛主席著作和革命大批判的群众运动更加深入、更加广泛地开展起来，突出无产阶级政治，力争做到农业“六好”，夺取革命、生产双丰收。
    一个个光采夺目的工农兵英雄形象，呈现在我们面前。江青同志高举毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大红旗，带领文艺界革命闯将披荆斩棘、树立起来的《红灯记》等八个革命样板戏，把颠倒的历史再颠倒过来，开出了无产阶级文艺灿烂的花朵。在文化大革命中，文艺界的无产阶级革命派沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利前进。中国赫鲁晓夫所顽固维护的帝王将相、才子佳人统治舞台的日子，一去不复返了。工农兵不仅是政治舞台的主人，而且成为文艺舞台的主人。
    革命的红卫兵在前进！
    红卫兵运动刚刚从东方地平线上出现，毛主席就亲切地教导革命小将：无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己！
    今天，广大的革命红卫兵已经在毛主席的伟大号召下，团结起来，联合起来了。他们决心一辈子与工农相结合，按照毛主席的教导，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命轨道上来，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人！
    在天安门城楼上，红卫兵小将今天又一次拥在伟大领袖毛主席周围。毛主席微笑着同他们握手、谈话。他们激动地向他老人家保证：
    “我们一定响应毛主席的最新号召，要斗私，批修；为人民立新功，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
      钢　铁　的　长　城
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”十七个大字，在游行队伍里闪耀着光芒。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军，是一支文武双全、举世无双的无产阶级的军队，是一座伟大的钢铁长城！
    人民解放军这座长城，是毛主席亲手缔造的，是林彪副主席直接指挥的。这座长城，是无数革命先烈用鲜血和生命筑成的。这座长城，经历了毛主席的无产阶级军事路线战胜资产阶级军事路线的激烈斗争，经历了无产阶级文化大革命的风雨，更加坚不可摧！
    这是防御帝国主义侵略、保卫我国国防安全的钢铁长城，这是巩固我国无产阶级专政、保卫社会主义革命和社会主义建设的钢铁长城。
    英雄的战士牢固地捍卫着祖国的大门，给一切敢于来犯的敌人以迎头痛击，保卫和支持无产阶级文化大革命，促使工农业生产的发展。他们在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，建立了新的光辉的历史功勋。
    “人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”毛主席一声令下，千军万马立即行动。他们无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定地支持革命左派，团结广大群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派英勇冲杀。他们中间，涌现了许许多多先进的集体。今年，爱民模范谢臣的弟弟、谢臣生前所在班班长谢起，和全班同志在大寨大队“支农”的时候，阶级敌人刮起了一股黑风，全班同志坚定地站在以陈永贵同志为代表的无产阶级革命派一边，捍卫了毛主席亲自树立的这一面红旗。
    来自“支左”第一线的同志们说：“千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想武装群众是最大的支援。”英雄的子弟兵组成了千万个毛泽东思想宣传队，活跃在街头、田间、厂房，把毛主席的声音传到祖国的每一个角落。北京师大一附中曾经是中国赫鲁晓夫直接推行资产阶级反动路线的一个点。在这里进行军训的同志，大立毛泽东思想，同革命师生一起，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。革命小将说得好：“中国的赫鲁晓夫把我们搞得四分五裂，解放军同志用毛泽东思想把我们重新团结起来。”
    革命群众热烈地赞扬解放军最听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。
    当革命小将在白色恐怖中遭受迫害的时候，是解放军挺身而出，最坚决地支持他们。
    当阶级敌人刮起经济主义的妖风的时候，是解放军同无产阶级革命派一起，挑起了“抓革命，促生产”的两副重担。
    当别有用心的家伙挑起武斗的时候，是解放军带着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，耐心说服群众，英勇地制止武斗。
    当两个阶级进行生死大搏斗的关键时刻，又是解放军帮助革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向。
    游行队伍抬着“拥军爱民”的巨幅标语牌，昂首阔步地前进。在艰苦斗争的日日夜夜里，人民解放军和广大的革命群众，肩并肩，心连心，鱼水相依，骨肉相连，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。成千上万的革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中，深深地体验到：没有人民的军队，就没有坚强的无产阶级专政，就没有社会主义的大民主，就没有无产阶级文化大革命，就没有今天这样空前大好的形势。他们说：世界上哪有这样好的军队？谁要反对我们无产阶级专政的擎天柱，我们决不答应！
    林彪副主席说：“汹涌澎湃的群众运动，又总是反过来大大鼓舞和教育了军队，成为锻炼和提高军队政治觉悟的革命熔炉。”
    来自“三支”“两军”第一线的指战员，对这一点深有体会：“三支”“两军”的第一线，是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。在这里，矛盾最尖锐，斗争最复杂，教材最丰富，教员最高明，最能触及灵魂。他们说得好：“阶级斗争风雨炼意志，文化革命熔炉铸红心”。
    全军指战员，坚决响应林彪副主席关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的号召，在“三支”“两军”中，在无产阶级文化大革命中，学出了新水平，用出了新水平。他们在阶级斗争中锻炼得更加坚强了。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌！
    人民解放军这座伟大的长城，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想阳光的照耀下，威严矗立在世界的东方！它是中国人民的钢铁长城！它是世界革命人民的钢铁长城！
      胜　利　的　航　程
    “大海航行靠舵手”的雄壮歌声，在首都上空高高飞扬。我们的伟大舵手，就是毛主席。我们的大海，就是阶级斗争的大海，就是革命斗争的大海。
    红旗如林，五洲欢腾。在世界革命的中心北京，举世瞩目的天安门城楼上，毛主席雄伟的身影，正是伟大舵手的庄严形象。您领导我们进行了世界历史上罕见的最艰苦、最激烈、最长期、最复杂的斗争，迎来了中国革命的伟大胜利。
    我们英明的舵手毛主席，拨正了世界革命的航向，冲破了以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏联叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起的重重恶浪，引导着全世界无产阶级和革命人民朝着人类解放的道路，奋勇前进！
    伟大的舵手毛主席啊，我们全国人民对您无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚！在天安门城楼和观礼台上，有身经百战、转战万里的人民解放军的指挥员。他们跟着毛主席，从井冈山到大渡河，从宝塔山到北京。无论哪一个重要的历史时期，他们都紧跟伟大统帅毛主席。一位跟着毛主席上井冈山的解放军高级指挥员，从他四十年的战斗历程中深深体会到：“中国革命离开毛主席的航向，就一定遭受挫折；按毛主席的航线走，胜利就一个接着一个。跟着毛主席就是胜利，这是历史的总结。”
    毛主席最关心干部，最爱护干部，最注意从政治上、思想上帮助干部。去年，毛主席第七次检阅文化革命大军时，对干部们说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”今天，在天安门城楼上，伟大领袖同一位屡建战功的老同志亲切地谈了话。这位同志激动地说：我要一辈子紧跟毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，革命到底！
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，向全世界播下了革命的火种。全世界革命人民，从人类历史上最伟大的革命变革中，看到了自己的未来，看到了人类的灿烂的春天。
    观礼台上，来自五大洲的朋友们和我们共同庆祝中国人民的光辉节日，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，欢呼全世界进入伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代。来自反帝反修前线的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友们，无限深情地说：“阿尔巴尼亚和中国虽然远隔万水千山，伟大的毛泽东把我们连接在一起。我们时刻仰望着世界的东方，高唱最响亮的歌曲《东方红》。”
    正在中国访问演出的日本齿轮座的革命文艺工作者，举着“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁”的红色横幅标语，用汉话演唱毛主席语录歌。他们说：“中国的今天，就是我们的明天！走毛主席指引的道路，这就是全世界人民的结论。”
    广场上高举花束的群众，涌向天安门，涌向我们最最敬爱的毛主席。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们向您宣誓：一定紧跟您的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。我们一定要把中国建设成为世界革命最强大、最巩固的根据地，坚决支持世界人民的革命斗争。毛主席教导我们：“大风大浪也不可怕。人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”我们一定沿着您所亲手开辟的革命航道，迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪，奋勇前进！
    让那些预感到末日来临的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，在我们伟大祖国的面前发抖吧，革命的潮流必将把它们彻底埋葬！
    未来属于我们！
    胜利属于我们！
