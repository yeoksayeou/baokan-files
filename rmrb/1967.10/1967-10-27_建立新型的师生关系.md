Since the resumption of classes and the start of the revolutionary movement at Caochangdi Middle School in Beijing half a year ago, we have gained a very important experience: through "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism," we have established a new type of teacher-student relationship.

A poor teacher-student relationship has been a major obstacle to the resumption of classes and the revolutionary movement. Initially, teachers generally did not want to go to class to teach. Some reluctantly went to observe but could not get along with the students. Others demanded a change of profession or a transfer. Among the students, some looked down on the teachers and blamed them for being "backward and conservative."

In response to this situation, the PLA comrades who were carrying out military training actively conducted political and ideological education, helping revolutionary teachers and students to study, apply, and practice Chairman Mao's works, criticize the self and repudiate revisionism, and eliminate misunderstandings.

The PLA comrades focused on doing ideological work among the teachers, helping them study Chairman Mao's teachings on the ideological transformation of intellectuals. This helped everyone realize that "intellectuals must remove the inappropriate things from their minds to be able to undertake the task of educating others." Through the study of the "Three Articles," they guided everyone to place themselves within the context, reveal their thoughts, find the reasons for not wanting to go to class, and summarize it as a matter of "fear." For example, fear of encountering difficulties, fear of losing face, fear of not teaching well, fear of making mistakes, and so on. Why are they afraid? Initially, everyone emphasized objective reasons and pushed the responsibility onto the students. Later, by comparing themselves with Mao Zedong's teachings of "completely," "thoroughly," and "two extremes," they examined the harm and dug out the root cause. Only then did they realize that the fear was due to the "self" causing trouble, considering only personal dignity, face, and future, forgetting the interests of the Party and the revolution, and not establishing the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly. Someone said: "'Self' in charge, dizzy and confused; without criticizing the self, it is impossible to improve the teacher-student relationship and impossible to carry out the resumption of classes and the revolutionary movement." The PLA comrades seized this active thought, persistently helping the teachers conduct four rounds of criticism and self-criticism, launching a fierce attack on the "self," thoroughly breaking down individualistic thoughts, and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the thought revolutionization of the teachers.

At the same time, the PLA comrades also helped the students study Chairman Mao's views on class and class struggle, and related views on the masses, policies, and discipline, educating the students to correctly treat the teachers. During the study of class and class struggle, they guided everyone to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the teachers. During the study of the mass line, they guided everyone to criticize the erroneous thought of "doubt everything, overthrow everything," believing that the vast majority of teachers are good. During the study of policies and discipline, they guided everyone to strongly oppose anarchism, raise the level of policies, strengthen the concept of discipline, and consciously respect and support the teachers' teaching work. After the study, the students actively invited the teachers to the class to hold heart-to-heart talks, conduct self-criticism, and drafted the "Eight Rules for Respecting Teachers," which they consciously followed. Some teachers said: "The students' thought revolutionization is advancing by leaps and bounds. If we stop progressing, we will have no right to speak in the classroom." After discussion, the teachers formulated the "Eight Rules for Loving Students" as their guidelines for going to class.

Improving the teacher-student relationship is a thought revolution of criticizing the self and establishing the public. It requires repeated struggles. After the teachers went to class, the PLA comrades continued to help them study Chairman Mao's works with the problems they encountered, thoroughly transform their worldview, and integrate with the masses, achieving three serious efforts: First, seriously implement the "Five Together" (study Chairman Mao's works together with the students, struggle against the capitalist roaders in power within the Party together, labor together, exercise together, and entertain together). They are both teachers and students and comrades-in-arms, blending teachers and students into one, changing the past situation of "together in class, separate after class." Second, seriously do ideological work, take the lead in emphasizing politics, implement the Four Firsts, and put the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place in everything. Many teachers used their spare time to hold discussions and heart-to-heart talks with the students, carrying out mutual assistance in thoughts. More teachers used their spare time and holidays to visit the students' parents, doing ideological work in the students' homes, changing the past tendency of "teaching without educating," and "focusing on work but not on thoughts." Third, seriously learn from the students. The teachers went to the students to prepare lessons, first became students, and then became teachers. They adopted the method of inspiration, abolished the method of injection, and seriously implemented the principle of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers." The teachers taught, and the students also taught, learning from each other and helping each other, changing the past practice of "the teacher lectures, the students listen."

    建立新型的师生关系
    朝军五
    北京市草场地中学复课闹革命半年来有一条很重要的体会，就是通过“斗私，批修”，建立新型的师生关系。
    师生关系不好，是复课闹革命的一大障碍。开始，老师普遍不愿下班讲课，有的勉强下去看看，也和学生搞不到一块，还有的人要求改行或调动工作。在同学中间，也有的瞧不起老师，责备老师“落后保守”。
    针对这一情况，执行军训任务的解放军同志，积极做政治思想教育工作，帮助革命师生活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，消除隔阂。
    解放军同志着重做好老师的思想工作，帮助老师学习毛主席关于知识分子思想改造的教导，使大家认识到：“知识分子如果不把自己头脑里的不恰当的东西去掉，就不能担负起教育别人的任务。”通过大学“老三篇”，引导大家把自己摆进去，把思想亮出来，找出不愿下班的原因，集中起来就是一个“怕”字。如怕碰钉子，怕丢面子，怕讲不好课，怕犯错误，等等。为什么“怕”呢？起初大家强调客观原因，把责任推在学生身上。后来，以毛主席“完全”“彻底”和“两个极端”的教导对照自己，查危害，挖根源。这才认识到“怕”字当头是因为“私”字作怪，只考虑个人的尊严、面子、前途，忘记了党和革命的利益，没有树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。有人说：“‘私’字当家，头昏眼花；不斗私，就没法搞好师生关系，就没法搞好复课闹革命。”对这一活思想，解放军同志抓住不放，接连四次帮助老师开展批评与自我批评，向“私”字猛烈开火，大破个人主义思想，大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威，促进了老师的思想革命化。
    解放军同志同时也帮助同学学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争和有关群众观点、政策和纪律的论述，教育同学们正确对待教师。在学习阶级和阶级斗争观点时，引导大家对老师进行全面分析。在学习群众观点时，引导大家批判“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的错误思想，相信绝大多数教师是好的。在学习政策纪律观点时，引导大家大反无政府主义，提高政策水平，加强纪律观念，自觉地尊重和支持教师的教学工作。经过学习，同学们主动把老师请到班里来开谈心会，作自我批评，并拟订出尊师“八条”，自觉遵守。有些老师说：“同学们的思想革命化一日千里，我们要是止步不前，课堂上就没有发言权了。”老师们经过讨论，制定出爱生“八条”，作为自己下班的行动守则。
    搞好师生关系，是一场破私立公的思想革命，要经过反复的斗争。老师下班以后，解放军同志又不断地帮助他们带着遇到的问题学习毛主席著作，彻底改造世界观，和群众相结合，作到三个认真：一是认真实行“五同”（和同学们一同学习毛主席著作，一同斗争党内走资本主义道路的当权派，一同劳动，一同出操，一同娱乐），既是师生，又是战友，师生打成一片，改变了过去“上课在一起，下课各东西”的状况。二是认真作思想工作，带头突出政治，落实四个第一，事事处处把宣传毛泽东思想放在首位。许多老师利用课余时间，在同学中开座谈会、谈心会，开展思想互助。更多的老师利用业余和假日走访学生家长，把思想工作做到学生家里，改变了过去“教书不教人”，“抓业务不抓思想”的倾向。三是认真向学生学习，老师们到学生中去备课，先做学生，然后再做先生。讲课采取启发式，废除注入式，认真贯彻“官教兵，兵教官”的原则，老师教，学生也教，互教互学，教学相长，改变了过去单纯的“先生讲，学生听”的作法。
