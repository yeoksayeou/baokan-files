Title: Sweetened Poison

"Material incentives" are like poison pills coated in sugar. Whoever takes them will become deaf and dizzy, lose their bearings, and fall into the capitalist gutter without realizing it, dying unaware.

The Soviet revisionist clique openly peddles this poison, and the Chinese Khrushchev also openly deals in it. Shamelessly, he shouts:

"We must mobilize the initiative of local authorities, departments, and enterprises. There should be some freedom, a reward system. It doesn't have to be rewards in kind; money can also be used," and so on.

In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, money is all-powerful. With money, everything can be accomplished. Is that really the case? During the "2.26" massive bombing of Shanghai by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits in 1950, our workers, filled with class hatred and national resentment, and with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and to socialist construction, braved the danger of enemy air raids and disregarded personal safety. They courageously carried out rescue and repair work, and in forty-eight hours restored power generation, achieving victory against the bombing. Was this achieved through bonuses? The Chinese Khrushchev sees only money; this despicable traitor to the proletariat cannot understand our proletarian revolutionary spirit!

Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!

    包着糖衣的毒药
    “物质刺激”就象外面包着糖衣的毒药。谁吃了，谁就会耳聋眼花，昏头转向，一交跌到资本主义阴沟里，不知不觉地死去。
    苏联修正主义集团公开出售这种毒药，中国赫鲁晓夫也公开贩卖这种毒药。他恬不知耻地叫嚷：
  “要发挥地方、部门、企业的积极性，要有点小自由，要有奖励制度，不一定要奖产品，奖钱也可以”，如此等等。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，金钱是万能的。只要有了钱，什么都好办。难道真是这样吗？一九五○年美蒋匪帮对上海进行“二·六”大轰炸时，我们工人怀着阶级仇民族恨，怀着对毛主席、对社会主义建设无限忠诚的心情，冒着敌机轰炸的危险，不顾个人生命的安危，英勇地进行抢救和抢修，终于在四十八小时内恢复了发电，取得了反轰炸的胜利。这难道是奖金刺激出来的吗？中国赫鲁晓夫的眼睛里只有钱，他这个可耻的无产阶级叛徒哪能理解我们无产阶级的革命激情！
    打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！
