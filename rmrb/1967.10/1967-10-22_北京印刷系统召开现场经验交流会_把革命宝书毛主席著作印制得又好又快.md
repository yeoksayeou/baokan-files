The Beijing printing system recently held an on-site experience exchange meeting at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Printing Factory. Over forty units, including the China Printing Company and the Beijing Printing Company, attended the meeting on the printing and binding quality of Chairman Mao's works. The attendees resolved to print the revolutionary treasure, Chairman Mao's works, at high speed and high quality, providing more ideological weapons for the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism."

Representatives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Printing Factory shared their factory's experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in printing and binding Chairman Mao's works well. Representatives from various units attended the meeting and conducted on-site learning and observation.

Since July of last year, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Printing Factory have taken on the task of printing Chairman Mao's works. By mid-October this year, they have printed over six million copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in various languages, including Chinese, foreign languages, and minority languages, 570,000 copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and 1.17 million copies of various single-volume works. They have completed and exceeded their production tasks month after month, becoming a leading unit in Beijing for the high-quality and high-speed printing of Chairman Mao's works.

This factory had never printed Chairman Mao's works before. After taking on the task of printing revolutionary books during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers regarded this as their greatest happiness and highest honor. They said excitedly, "Printing one more copy of Chairman Mao's works is contributing more to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the world revolution." With their deep love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and their high sense of responsibility to the people and the revolution, the workers meticulously ensured the printing quality. They established seven quality control checkpoints, with everyone, every process, and every level ensuring the high speed and high quality of printing Chairman Mao's works. The workers also relied on their own efforts, daring to innovate, and created and improved more than ten types of technical equipment, including grinding machines, rounding machines, drying machines, and laminating machines. They humbly learned from sister units and quickly succeeded in experimenting with advanced technologies such as wireless binding and red plastic lamination, further improving the printing and binding quality and speeding up the printing process.

After listening to the introduction by the comrades from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Printing Factory, the more than 300 representatives who attended this on-site meeting were greatly inspired. They unanimously expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to take "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism" as the guiding principle, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to complete and exceed the glorious task of printing Chairman Mao's works this year with even faster speed and even higher quality.

    据新华社二十一日讯　中国印刷公司、北京市印刷公司等有关四十多个单位，最近在中国科学院印刷厂召开毛主席著作印装质量经验交流会议，决心高速度高质量地印制革命宝书毛主席著作，为广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众“斗私，批修”更多地提供思想武器。
    中国科学院印刷厂的代表，在这次会议上介绍了他们工厂的革命职工活学活用毛主席著作，印好装订好毛主席著作的经验。各单位出席会议的代表，在这个工厂进行了参观和学习。
    科学院印刷厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，自去年七月接受印制毛主席著作任务以来，到今年十月中旬止，他们已经印制出中外文少数民族文等十多种文字的《毛泽东选集》六百多万册，《毛主席语录》五十七万册，各种单行本一百一十七万册。他们月月完成和超额完成生产任务，成为北京市印制毛主席著作质量好，速度快的一个先进单位。
    这个工厂过去从未印制过毛主席著作。在文化大革命中接受了印制革命宝书的任务以后，职工们把这看作是自己最大的幸福，最大的光荣。他们激动地说：“多印制一本毛主席著作就是对文化大革命和世界革命多出一份力量。”职工们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚感情和对人民对革命的高度责任感，一丝不苟，狠抓印制质量。他们组成七道保证质量关口，人人把关，道道把关，层层把关，保证了印制毛主席著作的高速度，高质量。职工们还自力更生，大胆革新，自己制造和革新了磨背机、扒圆机、烘干机、压膜机等十多种技术设备，他们虚心向兄弟单位学习，很快试验成功无线装订法的先进技术和红塑料压膜的技术，进一步提高了印装质量，加快了印制速度。
    参加这次现场会议的三百多名代表听了科学院印刷厂同志的介绍以后，深受鼓舞，一致表示决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，用更快的速度，更高的质量，保证完成和超额完成今年印制毛主席著作的光荣任务。
