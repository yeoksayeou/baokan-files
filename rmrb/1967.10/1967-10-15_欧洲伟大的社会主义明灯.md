A brilliant red flag of socialism is proudly flying in the "Land of the Eagles" by the Adriatic Sea in Europe. The heroic "Land of the Eagles" stands unyielding amidst the encirclement of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces from various countries. It proudly holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and marches from victory to victory on the path of socialism. As the world's people praise her with admiration and beautiful words, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out last December 25: "Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great socialist beacon in Europe."

"Albania, you are a mountain towering to the heavens!" "Albania, you are an unshakable socialist fortress!" "Albania, you are a reliable base for the proletarian revolution!" Just as the people of the entire nation are shouting these earth-shaking cheers and warmly welcoming the Albanian Party and Government delegation headed by Comrade Shehu, the "Great Socialist Beacon in Europe" photo exhibition opened solemnly in Beijing, the center of the world revolution, on October 13.

The opening of the "Great Socialist Beacon in Europe" photo exhibition is another song of praise for the fighting friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania. The photographs taken by the Chinese photography delegation in Albania enthusiastically sing the praises of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, enthusiastically sing the praises of the long-tested Albanian Party of Labor, enthusiastically sing the praises of the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and introduce the movement of "one hand holding a pickaxe, one hand holding a gun" carried out by the Albanian people. It also introduces the vigorous ideological revolutionization movement underway in Albania and vividly introduces the abundant fruits of these movements.

Upon entering the exhibition hall, one immediately feels the fiery revolutionary atmosphere, feels the precious proletarian revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people, and their deep affection for the glorious Party and the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha. Look at the photographs of Comrade Enver Hoxha among the people: the leader cares for the people and trusts the people; the people's smiling faces greet the leader, and their red hearts turn towards the leader, expressing their boundless loyalty to the Party and the leader. This moving scene tells people that the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Party is the most reliable guarantee for the Albanian people to achieve all their victories.

The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor held last winter is a congress of great historical significance. This congress formulated a program to realize the revolutionization of the entire national life and social life, pushing Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new stage. The call of the Fifth Congress quickly spread throughout Albania's cities and villages, mountains, and plains. The entire nation responded resolutely to the Party's call, taking action at the first sign of wind, and launched a new high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction throughout the country. Various places in Albania present a lively revolutionary scene.

Look: The soldiers and officers of the Albanian People's Army, the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, tightly grip their guns and stand guard with the people, vigilantly defending the socialist motherland's borders. To strengthen the Party's leadership in the army and highlight proletarian politics, each unit of this army has now established party committees, restored the system of political commissars at all levels, and abolished military ranks, further tightening the relationship between officers and soldiers. The exhibited photographs show the situation of soldiers and officers studying the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha, conducting party history study, and revolutionary tradition education. In one photograph, a lively scene is captured: next to the green grass by the airfield, the commander of the people's army is warmly chatting with the soldiers, understanding the soldiers' thoughts. From the soldiers' joyful faces, one can see the close comradeship between officers and soldiers. The soldiers and officers of the people's army actively respond to the Party's call, holding guns in one hand and pickaxes in the other, relying on their own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in food. The photographs also reflect the scene of soldiers and officers working together in military farms. The Albanian People's Army, which continuously strengthens ideological and political construction, is an invincible armed force of the working people. It is the pride of the Albanian people.

The Albanian working class has a high level of socialist consciousness and always stands at the forefront of the socialist struggle. In the revolutionization movement, they put forward many revolutionization proposals. In socialist construction, they respond enthusiastically to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor, overfulfilling and completing the production plan ahead of schedule. From the exhibited photographs, one can see that by the steel furnaces, by the spinning machines, and at the beautiful port of Durres, the heroic Albanian workers are working hard to build their socialist motherland even more beautifully. A large number of advanced producers have emerged, including those photographed here who have won the honorable title of the "Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor" in the advanced mining team of Kukes Copper Mine, those who have made outstanding achievements in supporting agriculture in response to the Party's call, and excellent enterprise managers. The heroic Albanian workers, with their high socialist revolutionary enthusiasm, are building Albania more prosperous and beautiful with their wisdom and hands.

The cadres of Albania actively respond to the Party's call for cadre rotation and cadre participation in physical labor. Officers of the people's army, officials of organs, engineers of factories, and cultural workers all go to the mountains and countryside, striving to be ordinary laborers and maintain their revolutionary character. In one photograph, an elderly doctor with white hair is seen chatting warmly with rural medical workers and members of agricultural cooperatives. This old doctor was originally a department head of the people's army health department, and he responded to the Party's call to work as an ordinary doctor in the Fier region. In another photograph, three young members of the Central Committee of the Albanian Youth League and technicians from the Shkodra cigarette factory are holding pickaxes and going to the border region to work as members of cooperatives. Their spirited and determined faces show their resolve to dedicate their youth to the socialist construction of their motherland.

Albanian youth have always been at the forefront of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the movement to "fiercely attack reactionary old customs," they were the first to post big-character posters. Young workers use big-character posters (lightning reports) to fiercely attack bureaucracy and old customs. The photographs capture such scenes: in the factory workshops, big-character posters are posted everywhere, and workers gather around to read them, cheer for them, and praise them. From their serious expressions, one can see that they are deeply aware of their important role in the socialist revolution. Young students also shoulder pickaxes and go to the fields, and carry tools to the factories. They closely connect with the masses and reality, determined to temper themselves into reliable red successors.

Members of agricultural cooperatives also carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction with great revolutionary enthusiasm. Mountain farmers realized full cooperation within three months after the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and marched towards the barren mountains. The exhibited photographs present moving scenes to the audience: in the undulating mountains, the members rely on their strong hands to move away giant rocks and build neat terraces; the former marshes also grow good crops, and the golden wheat sea stretches as far as the eye can see. Albania, once known as the poorest country in Europe, has now become a socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture under the hands of the heroic people.

Many of the exhibited photographs reflect the Albanian people's boundless love for our great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. As the comrades of the Chinese photography delegation said, everywhere in Albania, one can feel the Albanian people's love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The Albanian people, who are advancing on the road of revolutionization, have an unbounded love for the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao, and eagerly yearn to learn the strongest weapon against imperialism and revisionism, Mao Zedong Thought. The photographs reflect that in cities, in mountain areas, in the army, and in mines, people wear the golden Mao badges on their chests, and people gather together to seriously study the works of Chairman Mao.

In the exhibition hall, there is a quotation from the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha: "Albania was born in revolution, achieved socialist victory in revolution, and will march towards communism in revolution." The Chinese people firmly believe that the heroic Albanian red flag flying high in Europe will become even more brilliant in the struggle for socialist revolution and socialist construction, in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. It will definitely fly even higher. On the march towards communism, this great socialist beacon in Europe will definitely shine even more brilliantly for the entire Europe and the whole world.

　　欧洲伟大的社会主义明灯
    在欧洲，一面鲜艳夺目的社会主义红旗，在亚得里亚海边的“山鹰之国”高高飘扬。英雄的“山鹰之国”，在帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的包围中坚毅不屈，巍然屹立，她高高举起马克思列宁主义革命大旗，在社会主义的大道上从胜利走向胜利。正当世界人民以敬佩的心情、美好的语言称颂她的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在去年十二月二十五日向全世界指出：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”
    “阿尔巴尼亚，你是耸入云霄的高山！”“阿尔巴尼亚，你是不可动摇的社会主义堡垒！”“阿尔巴尼亚，你是无产阶级革命的可靠根据地！”正当全国人民发出这些震天动地的欢呼，热情欢迎以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的时候，“欧洲伟大的社会主义明灯”摄影展览，十月十三日在世界革命的中心北京隆重开幕了。
    “欧洲伟大的社会主义明灯”摄影展览的开幕，是中阿两党、两国、两国人民战斗友谊的又一曲颂歌。由中国摄影代表团在阿尔巴尼亚摄下的这些照片，热情歌颂了阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，热情歌颂了久经考验的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，热情歌颂了阿尔巴尼亚人民在反帝反修斗争中的革命精神，介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民开展“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的运动，介绍了正在阿尔巴尼亚蓬勃开展思想革命化运动，生动地介绍了这些运动所结出的丰硕成果。
    走进展览大厅，人们就会立刻感受到火热的革命气氛，感受到阿尔巴尼亚人民可贵的无产阶级的革命精神，以及他们对光荣的劳动党和伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志无限热爱的深厚感情。看恩维尔·霍查同志来到群众中间的照片吧：领袖关心群众，信任群众；人们的一张张笑脸迎着领袖，一颗颗红心向着领袖，表达他们对党对领袖的无限忠诚。这动人的情景告诉人们，马克思列宁主义党的领导，是阿尔巴尼亚人取得一切胜利的最可靠的保证。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党去年冬天举行的第五次代表大会，是具有伟大历史意义的大会，这次大会制定了使整个国家生活和社会生活实现革命化的纲领，它把阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向一个新的阶段。五大的号召，迅速传遍了阿尔巴尼亚的城市和乡村，山区和平原。阿尔巴尼亚举国上下，坚决响应党的号召，闻风而动，在全国开展了进一步思想革命化运动，掀起了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新高潮。阿尔巴尼亚各地呈现出一片生气勃勃的革命景象。
    你看：作为无产阶级专政柱石的阿尔巴尼亚人民军的指战员，紧握手中枪，和人民群众在一起，警惕地守卫着社会主义祖国的边疆。为了加强党在部队中的领导，突出无产阶级政治，现在这支军队的各部队都建立了党委会，恢复了各级政委制，取消了军衔，进一步密切了官兵关系。展出的图片中，有指战员学习恩维尔·霍查同志著作、进行党史学习和革命传统教育的情况。在一张图片中拍摄下这样的生动情景：在停机坪旁的青草地上，人民军的指挥员正亲切地和战士们谈心，了解战士的思想情况，从战士们喜悦的面孔上，可以看出指战员亲密无间的同志关系。人民军指战员们积极响应党的号召，在拿枪的同时，也拿起镐头，自力更生，实现食品自给，图片也反映了指战员一同劳动在军垦农场的情景。不断加强思想政治建设的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，是不可战胜的劳动人民的武装，它是阿尔巴尼亚人民的骄傲。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级具有高度社会主义觉悟，他们永远走在社会主义斗争的最前头。在革命化运动中，他们提出许多革命化建议，在社会主义建设中，他们以高昂的劳动热情，积极响应劳动党第五次代表大会的号召，超额并提前完成生产计划。从展出的图片中可以看到，在炼钢炉旁，在纺织机边，在美丽的都拉斯港口，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人为把社会主义祖国建设得更加美好，在紧张地劳动着。大批的先进生产者涌现出来，这里拍摄下的有，荣获“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会”光荣称号的库克斯铜矿先进掘进队的同志们，有积极响应党的号召在支援农业中作出优异成绩的先进技术员，有优秀的企业管理能手。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人正以高昂的社会主义革命热情，用他们的智慧和双手把阿尔巴尼亚建设得更加富强、美丽。
    阿尔巴尼亚的干部积极响应党提出的干部轮换制和干部参加体力劳动的号召。人民军的军官、机关干部、工厂的工程师、文艺工作者，纷纷上山下乡，争当一名普通劳动者，使自己保持革命者的本色。在一幅图片上，一位白发苍苍的老年医生和农村医务工作者、农业合作社社员在一起，亲切交谈。这位老医生原是人民军卫生部的一位部长，他响应党的号召到发罗拉地区当一名普通的医生。在另一张图片上，三位阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央候补委员、斯库台卷烟厂的技术员，手拿镐头，来到边疆地区合作社当社员，他们精神焕发和坚毅的面容，表现了誓把青春献给祖国社会主义建设事业的决心。
    阿尔巴尼亚青年，一直是站在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的最前列，在“向反动的旧习俗猛烈开火”的运动中，是他们贴出了第一张大字报。青年工人利用大字报（闪电报），向官僚主义和旧习俗猛烈开火。图片拍下了这样的情景：在工厂的车间里，贴满了一张张革命的闪电报，工人们围看这些大字报，欢呼它，赞扬它，从他们严肃的表情中，可以看出他们深知自己在社会主义革命中的重任。青年学生也扛起镐头走向田间，手持工具走向工厂，他们密切联系群众，联系实际，决心要把自己锻炼成为可靠的红色接班人。
    农业合作社社员也以极大革命热情进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。山区农民在劳动党第五次代表大会后不到三个月，全部实现了合作化，并且向荒山进军。展出的图片中展现在观众面前一幅幅动人情景：在峰峦起伏的群山中，社员们全凭一双结实的手，搬走了巨石，造出整齐的层层梯田；昔日的沼泽地，也长出了一片好庄稼，只见那金黄的麦海，一望无际。阿尔巴尼亚过去被称为欧洲最贫穷的国家，现在它在英雄的人民手中，已变成具有现代工业、集体农业的社会主义国家。
    展出的许多照片，反映了阿尔巴尼亚人民对我们伟大领袖、世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席的无限热爱，正象中国摄影代表团的同志们说的，在阿尔巴尼亚到处感触到阿尔巴尼亚人民对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。在革命化道路上阔步前进的阿尔巴尼亚人民无限热爱当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席，迫切渴望学习反帝反修的最强大武器毛泽东思想。照片反映出，在城市，在山区，在部队，在矿山，人们把金光闪闪的毛主席像章戴在胸前，人们聚集在一起，认真学习毛主席著作的热烈情景。
    展览大厅里，挂着伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志的语录：“阿尔巴尼亚在革命中诞生，在革命中取得了社会主义胜利，它还将在革命中走向共产主义。”中国人民坚信英雄的阿尔巴尼亚这面高高飘扬在欧洲的社会主义红旗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的斗争中，在反帝反修的斗争中，定将更加鲜艳，永远高高飘扬。在走向共产主义的征途中，欧洲伟大的社会主义明灯，定将向整个欧洲，向全世界放射出更加灿烂的光芒。
