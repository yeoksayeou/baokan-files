Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit. This must be resolved.

In Beijing's Xuanwu District, a portion of the middle schools, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, quickly achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Among them, five schools combined the top leader.

The PLA Navy unit stationed in Beijing's Xuanwu District for military training has high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, helping the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to boldly liberate, bravely combine, and fully utilize revolutionary cadres. So far, in the 34 middle schools where they are conducting military training, 19 have achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Among them, five schools have their top leaders serving as the chairpersons of the revolutionary committees.

After the PLA comrades entered the schools, through in-depth and detailed investigations, they found that the basic situation of the cadre teams in these schools was good. They generally joined the revolution relatively early and underwent considerable revolutionary tempering. The vast majority of them love the Party and Chairman Mao. Although many of them made this or that mistake, and some even made serious mistakes, they still have the determination to correct their mistakes. From the perspective of the 19 schools that have already achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination, there are 122 deputy directors and above leaders. After a year of struggle, it is proven that the majority are good or relatively good. The masses firmly advocate overthrowing only a few capitalist-roaders within the Party. This situation proves that Chairman Mao's assertion that "we must believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres" is completely correct. However, due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line, many cadres and masses have developed a sense of estrangement and grievance.

The PLA comrades also learned that the majority of revolutionary teachers and students in these schools, especially the Red Guards, are actively supporting the cadres to come out and revolutionize. However, in the specific resolution of cadre issues, some selfish thoughts were exposed. For example, some people are afraid that if revolutionary cadres are combined, they themselves will not be able to be leaders and hold power; some people, in the early stages of the movement, criticized cadres and are afraid that after the cadres participate in the three-in-one combination, they will retaliate; some people still have the idea of "doubt everything, overthrow everything," and so on.

In summary, the obstacles to liberating cadres are, on the one hand, the pernicious influence of the capitalist reactionary line has not been eliminated, and on the other hand, a part of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have selfish thoughts to varying degrees. Therefore, the process of liberating revolutionary cadres, from beginning to end, is a process of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism."

In helping the revolutionary masses of the proletariat correctly resolve cadre issues, the PLA comrades first conducted in-depth education on the two-line struggle among the broad masses, mobilizing the masses to denounce and criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in the cadre issue of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number," helping the masses to see through the reactionary essence of the capitalist reactionary line, and then guiding everyone to study and apply the "Three Old Articles," break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness; study Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and correctly handle cadres who have made mistakes.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the 60th Middle School, with the help of the PLA comrades, boldly liberated their school's top leader, which is a good example of breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. The 60th Middle School originally had nine leading cadres, of whom eight Party member cadres were labeled as "black gang members" by the work team in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. Although some of them had come out relatively early, they had not been truly liberated. Because the school's top leader, Liu Yiping, was labeled as the "black gang leader" and was still sidelined, their relationship with Liu Yiping was not clear.

Was Liu Yiping a capitalist-roader? The revolutionary teachers and students of the 60th Middle School found the correct answer in the great criticism of the capitalist reactionary line. The facts proved that labeling Liu Yiping as a "black gang leader" was mainly due to the work team's execution of the capitalist reactionary line, inciting the masses to struggle against the cadres. For example, someone said she was an "active" follower of the revisionist educational line, but in fact, she, while implementing the revisionist educational line to a certain extent, also resisted it. In the past few years of leading work, she loved Chairman Mao, paid attention to grasping the school-wide study of Chairman Mao's works, conducted class education every year, and emphasized students' labor education. Through investigation and analysis, it was shown that Liu Yiping was a relatively good cadre. After Liu Yiping was liberated, the other seven Party member cadres were also gradually liberated and took up leading positions in the revolutionary committee, class revolutionary committees, and the Red Guard headquarters.

Whether revolutionary cadres can be fully utilized is also a test for revolutionary masses. The PLA comrades, based on the different thoughts reflected by revolutionary teachers and students at different times, guided everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fiercely struggle against the "self" in their minds, making everyone realize that the struggle for power by the revolutionary faction is for the entire proletariat to seize and consolidate power, not for personal power. The 7th Girls' Middle School once had a debate on whether the original Party branch secretary, Shen Yan, could be a three-in-one combination object. Some people thought that although Shen Yan was not an anti-Party, anti-socialist element, she was the top leader implementing the revisionist educational line in the school. If she was combined, the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation would not be able to go deep. Some people even worried that if Shen Yan was combined, they would be retaliated against in the future. The PLA comrades, in response to these thoughts, guided everyone to study the "Three Old Articles" and relevant editorials in the *Red Flag* and *People's Daily* on correctly handling cadres, making everyone realize that cadres who make mistakes, as long as they are determined to correct their mistakes, should be boldly utilized, allowing them to be tempered more in the future struggles and work, and not always adopt a distrustful attitude. After everyone's awareness was raised, they further analyzed Shen Yan's situation and unanimously agreed that Shen Yan was a revolutionary leader, and her integrity was good. She had resisted the revisionist educational line in the past, and when she was persecuted by the capitalist reactionary line, she still insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. With the agreement of the majority of revolutionary teachers and students, Shen Yan participated in the "three-in-one" leadership team and served as the chairman of the school revolutionary committee.

In helping the revolutionary masses of the proletariat resolve cadre issues, the PLA comrades also guided revolutionary cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, through "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," drawing a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line, and shifting their standpoint to the side of the revolutionary masses. The Party branch secretary and deputy principal of the 89th Middle School, Zhong Di, suffered serious persecution from the capitalist reactionary line in the early stages of the movement and had a lot of grievances. After the military training began, the unit comrades actively visited her home, encouraging her to throw herself into the hot mass movement. However, her thoughts were not truly resolved, and after returning to school, she still did not want to check and expose herself in the struggle. Revolutionary teachers and students and PLA comrades repeatedly talked to her, helping her to realize that in the cadre issue, "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" is the evil of the capitalist reactionary line, and hatred should be directed at the Chinese Khrushchev; on the other hand, seriously pointing out her past mistakes, in the movement, receiving criticism and struggle, is helpful for her own thought revolutionization. Zhong Di's thoughts quickly changed, and she actively checked and exposed herself to the entire school's teachers and students, receiving the warm welcome of the revolutionary masses, and was absorbed into the three-in-one leadership team, serving as the chairman of the school revolutionary committee.

    正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。						毛泽东
    大胆解放勇敢结合放手使用革命干部
    北京市宣武区一部分中学在解放军的帮助下迅速实现革命的三结合，其中五个学校结合了第一把手
    本报讯　在北京市宣武区执行军训任务的人民解放军海军某部指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，帮助无产阶级革命派大胆解放、勇敢结合、放手使用革命干部。到目前为止，在他们执行军训任务的三十四所中学中，已有十九所实现了革命的三结合，其中有五个学校的第一把手担任了革命委员会的主任委员。
    解放军同志进入学校以后，通过深入细致的调查研究，认为这些学校干部队伍的基本情况是好的。他们一般参加革命的时间都比较早，经过较多的革命锻炼，绝大多数人热爱党、热爱毛主席。尽管不少人犯有这样或那样的错误，有的人甚至错误比较严重，但他们仍然有决心改正自己的错误。就已经实现了革命的三结合的十九所中学来看，共有副主任以上的领导干部一百二十二名，经过一年来斗争的考验，证明大多数是好的或比较好的。群众坚决主张打倒的只有党内少数几个走资本主义道路的当权派。这种情况证明毛主席关于要“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的论断是完全正确的。但是，由于资产阶级反动路线的影响，不少干部和群众产生了隔阂，委屈情绪较重。
    解放军同志还了解到，这些学校里革命师生的大多数，特别是红卫兵小将，是积极支持干部站出来革命的。但是在具体解决干部问题时，也暴露出一些私心杂念。例如有的人怕结合了革命干部，自己当不成头头，掌不了权了；有的人在运动初期整了干部，怕干部参加三结合以后反过来打击报复；有的人还有“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的思想等等。
    总之，解放干部的阻力，一方面是资产阶级反动路线所造成的恶劣影响没有肃清，另一方面是一部分革命群众、革命干部都有不同程度的私心杂念。因此，解放革命干部的过程，自始至终是一个“斗私，批修”的过程。
    解放军同志在帮助无产阶级革命派正确解决干部问题时，首先对广大群众深入进行两条路线斗争的教育，发动群众控诉、批判中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的滔天罪行，帮助群众认清资产阶级反动路线的反动本质，然后再引导大家活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公；学习毛主席的干部政策，正确对待犯错误的干部。
    六十中广大革命师生在解放军同志的帮助下，大胆地解放了本校的第一把手，就是一个破私立公的好例子。六十中原有九名领导干部，其中八名党员干部在文化大革命初期被工作组打成“黑帮分子”，虽然有的已经比较早地站了出来，但是并没有真正得到解放。因为这个学校的第一把手刘一平被打成了“黑帮头子”，仍然靠边站，他们与刘一平的关系还弄不清楚。
    刘一平到底是不是走资本主义道路的当权派？六十中的革命师生在对资产阶级反动路线的大批判中找到了正确的答案。事实证明，把刘一平打成“黑帮头子”，主要是工作组执行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗争干部造成的。如有人说她是贯彻执行修正主义教育路线的“积极”分子，实际上她虽然在一定程度上执行了修正主义教育路线，但也有所抵制。在过去几年担任领导工作中，她对毛主席是热爱的，注意抓全校的学习毛主席著作活动，每年进行阶级教育，重视学生的劳动教育。通过调查和分析，说明刘一平是一个比较好的干部。刘一平被解放出来以后，其他七名党员干部也都陆续解放出来，分别在革命委员会、班文革小组和红卫兵总部担任领导工作。
    能否放手使用革命干部，也是对革命群众的一个考验。解放军同志根据各个不同时期革命师生中反映出来的活思想，引导大家活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗头脑里的“私”字，使大家认识到革命派的夺权斗争，是为整个无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权，绝不是为个人夺权。女七中曾围绕着原来的校党支部书记沈言同志能不能做为三结合对象，展开了一场辩论。少数人认为，沈言虽然不是反党反社会主义分子，但她是学校贯彻执行修正主义教育路线的第一把手，如果结合了她，学校的斗批改就无法深入下去。有些人甚至担心结合了沈言，将来要受到打击报复。解放军同志针对这些活思想，引导大家学习“老三篇”以及《红旗》、《人民日报》有关正确对待干部的社论，使大家认识到，对待犯错误的干部，只要他决心改正错误，就应当大胆使用，让他在今后的斗争中工作中得到更多的锻炼，不能一直采取不信任的态度。大家提高认识之后，进一步分析了沈言的情况，一致认为沈言是一个革命的领导干部，大节是好的。她曾经对修正主义教育路线有过抵制，在受资产阶级反动路线迫害时，仍然坚持活学活用毛主席著作。经过绝大多数革命师生同意，沈言参加了“三结合”领导班子，担任校革委会的主任委员。
    解放军同志在帮助无产阶级革命派解决干部问题时，还注意引导革命干部活学活用毛主席著作，通过“斗私，批修”，同资产阶级反动路线划清界线，把立足点移到革命群众一边来。八十九中党支部书记兼副校长钟悌，运动初期受到了资产阶级反动路线的严重迫害，委屈情绪很大。军训开始后，部队同志主动去她家探望，动员她投身到火热的群众运动中去。但是她的思想问题没有真正解决，到校后，仍然不愿意在斗争中检查、亮相。革命师生和解放军同志便找她反复谈心，和她一起活学活用毛主席著作，一方面帮助她认识到在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，应当把仇恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上；另一方面，严肃指出她过去的错误，在运动中受到批判斗争，有助于自己的思想革命化。钟悌同志思想很快转变过来，主动到全校师生中检查、亮相，受到了革命群众的热烈欢迎，并被吸收到三结合领导班子里来，担任了校革命委员会的主任委员。
