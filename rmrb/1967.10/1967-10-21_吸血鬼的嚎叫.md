The Howl of the Vampire

China's Khrushchev says: "Exploitation is not only not a sin, but also a merit." What are the merits of the capitalists? In the old, evil society, those who wove cloth had no clothes to wear, and those who farmed had no food to eat; while the capitalists who did not work, wore silk and satin, and ate delicacies from the mountains and seas. This clearly shows that it was the blood and sweat of our workers that sustained these wolves. In the early days of liberation, the predecessor of the Tianjin Dongya Factory was the Dechang Factory. The workers of the Dechang Factory had a song of blood and tears: "If you want to eat Dechang's food, you have to risk your life. In the morning, you go to work before dawn, and at midnight, you finish work. Chicken droppings and rat soup are hard to swallow, and itching from scabies keeps you awake. With blood and tears dried up, hatred fills the heart, when can we return home?"

Why does China's Khrushchev's language always clash with the workers? Why does China's Khrushchev always distort facts and talk nonsense? What kind of vine produces what kind of gourd, what class speaks what words. China's Khrushchev's howl of "exploitation is a merit" is the voice of the capitalist vampires. China's Khrushchev is the spokesperson for the capitalists, a genuine defender of capitalism. Tianjin City Workers' Congress Third Cotton Textile Factory

    吸血鬼的嚎叫
    中国赫鲁晓夫说：“剥削不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳。”资本家的“功劳”在那里呢？在万恶的旧社会里，织布的没衣穿，种地的没饭吃；而不劳而获的资本家，穿的是绫罗绸缎，吃的是山珍海味。这分明是我们工人的血汗养活了这群豺狼。解放初的天津东亚厂的前身是德昌厂，德昌厂的工人有首血泪歌：“要想吃上德昌饭，就得拿着性命换。早晨上班天不明，夜半三更才下班。鸡屎鼠汤难吞咽，疥疮痛痒不能眠。血尽泪干心头恨，何时才能把家还。”
    为什么中国赫鲁晓夫的语言总是与工人格格不入呢？为什么中国赫鲁晓夫总是颠倒事实瞎说呢？什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的嚎叫，就是资本家吸血鬼的声音。中国赫鲁晓夫就是资本家的总代言人，是个货真价实的资本主义辩护士。天津市工代会第三毛纺织厂
