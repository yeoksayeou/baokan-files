	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, OCTOBER 1ST—Revolutionary comrades and friends from many countries on five continents today celebrated our national day together with the revolutionary masses of the capital. They enthusiastically sang the praises of our great leader Chairman Mao and warmly hailed the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	As soon as the sun rose from the east, these international friends came to the reviewing stand in front of Tiananmen Gate with great excitement. They wore shining Mao badges on their chests and held red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands. Some of them, full of passion, played the accordion and sang "Father and Mother Are Dear, But Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" and "Beijing Has a Golden Sun" and other songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao in unison. Many foreign friends also sat together, opened their beloved revolutionary book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and read Chairman Mao's teachings in different languages.

	The happy moment arrived! When our great leader Chairman Mao appeared on Tiananmen Gate, the foreign friends facing Tiananmen Gate, towards Chairman Mao, repeatedly waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao forever!" The foreign friends saw that Chairman Mao was in such good health and happily said, "This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people, the greatest happiness for the people of the world."

	Comrades from the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, who have been fighting on the front lines against imperialism and revisionism, were warmly received by Chairman Mao yesterday. Today, they once again saw our great leader Chairman Mao. At that happy moment, they waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Left Ha Zou, a dancer who once played Wu Qinghua in the "Red Detachment of Women," and A. Mura, the composer who composed the song "Bombard the Headquarters" in praise of Chairman Mao, said, "Coming to brotherly China and seeing Chairman Mao, our long-cherished wish has finally been realized. We will never, never forget these two most precious days."

	Revolutionary cultural comrades from the Japanese Gear Seat Theater, who have broken through the heavy oppression of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, were deeply moved when they saw Chairman Mao. The young woman Sasaki Motoko, who was the first to write a big-character poster and fight against the revisionists in the troupe, said with tears, "Today is our happiest day! We must master Mao Zedong Thought and bring back the revolutionary spirit of rebellion that the Chinese people have shown in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to Japan." The director of the Gear Seat Theater, Fujikawa Natsu, said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally has shown the way for the world revolution. We, the Japanese people, will follow the path of revolution pointed out by Chairman Mao." The director of the Japanese Advance Theater, Kawahara Toranosuke, who has fought resolutely against the Japanese Communist Party's Royalist faction, said, "With such a great leader as Chairman Mao, the Japanese revolution will surely be victorious. With Mao Zedong Thought, we are like a ship sailing to the sea, with an infinite bright future, while the revisionists are heading towards the swamp and will soon sink. He said, "China is the base for the world's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. As long as the people of the world adhere to Mao Zedong Thought, then victory will surely belong to the people."

	The heroic fighters and brave warriors of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, who are on the front lines of the anti-American struggle, today happily ascended Tiananmen Gate and stood by the side of the great leader Chairman Mao. The director of the delegation, the heroic fighter Huang Wenda, said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is so healthy! When we return to South Vietnam, we will definitely tell the fighting South Vietnamese people about seeing Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's health, so that they can share the happiness and increase their strength to annihilate the Americans and kill the enemy."

	The Congolese (Brazzaville) youth delegation friends, after seeing Chairman Mao, sang "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" in Chinese over and over again. The director of the delegation, Gonsia Amie, said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people." He waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said, "Whenever we encounter difficulties in the struggle, we study this book and draw strength from it to advance. The delegation members Samba and Ponggu said, "Today we stand in front of Tiananmen Gate, at the center of the center of the world revolution, and see Chairman Mao. This is a great encouragement to us. Chairman Mao has brilliantly enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism. We are deeply convinced that the brilliant rays of Mao Zedong Thought will illuminate the whole world."

	Several anti-imperialist fighters from Latin America, who are currently engaged in armed struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, said, "Our greatest wish this time to visit China is to see the great leader Chairman Mao. For the revolutionary people of Latin America who are engaged in revolutionary struggle, Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb to smash imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. We will always remember Chairman Mao's teaching that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and firmly adhere to the path of armed struggle to win the victory of the revolutionary struggle."

	"Revolution bravely advances, nothing in the world can stop it; the great helmsman Chairman Mao steers the ship, the prospects for the revolution are extremely bright." This is a passionate praise from Albanian poet Ismail Kadare in a poem he wrote today: "Ode Written in Front of Tiananmen Gate." Many friends, like Kadare, were deeply moved by the surging parade and were deeply moved by the proletarian revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses of the capital. They warmly praised the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, on the revolutionary people of the world, and warmly hailed the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The director of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association delegation, Lai Biduo, said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a brilliant example of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world. It has greatly encouraged the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world and has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries. It has also dealt a heavy blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders in power headed by China's Khrushchev. I support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from the bottom of my heart."

	Luxembourg China Friendship Association delegation director Frank said, "I am moved by the great achievements of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This cultural revolution has made a great contribution to the world revolution. It has encouraged the revolutionary people of the world to struggle and has made the great Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout the world." Thai friend Paron Juralan said, "At present, the Thai people are engaged in a life-and-death armed struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys. The victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has given great encouragement to the struggle of the Thai people." Indonesian friend Isa said, "China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has destroyed the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, making the base of world revolution, the People's Republic of China, redder and stronger than ever before. This is a great historical victory for the revolutionary people of the world. Isa said, "The Indonesian people, who have experienced the brutal fascist rule of Suharto-Nasution, have further realized: only by following the path of the Chinese revolution, the path of armed struggle pointed out by Chairman Mao, can we achieve revolutionary victory."

	A friend from Africa, where the flames of armed struggle are burning, said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee of victory for the African people's struggle. The revolutionary people on the front lines of the liberation struggle have been greatly encouraged by the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely fight side by side with the seven hundred million Chinese people, advance along the path indicated by the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, and achieve victory!

    太阳刚刚从东方升起，这些国际友人就无比兴奋地来到天安门前的观礼台上。他们胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手里捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，有的人满怀激情拉起手风琴，手挽手一遍又一遍地齐声高歌《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》、《北京有个金太阳》等歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的中国歌曲。许多国家的朋友还坐在一起打开心爱的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，用不同的语言齐声朗读毛主席的教导。
    幸福的时刻来到了！当我们的伟大领袖毛主席来到天安门城楼的时候，各国朋友面对天安门，迎着毛主席，不断地挥动着《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”各国朋友见到毛主席身体是那样健康，高兴地说，这是中国人民的最大幸福，是世界人民的最大幸福。
    来自反帝反修斗争前线的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的同志们，昨天受到了毛主席极其亲切的接见。今天，他们又一次见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席。在那幸福的时刻，他们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术代表团的一位曾经在《红色娘子军》剧中扮演吴清华的舞蹈演员左·哈左，曾经作曲歌颂毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的作曲家阿·穆拉说，来到兄弟的中国，见到了毛主席，我们多年的愿望终于实现了，我们永远永远不会忘记这最珍贵的两天。
    从美日反动派和日共修正主义分子重重迫害下冲杀出来的日本齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战友们，在见到毛主席的时候，许多人激动得热泪盈眶。曾经第一个起来写大字报和剧团内修正主义分子进行斗争的女青年佐原元子，含着热泪说，今天是我们最最幸福的日子！我们一定要把毛泽东思想学到手，一定要把中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命造反精神带回日本。齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，为世界革命指明了方向。我们日本人民决心走毛主席指出的中国革命的道路。和日共宫本修正主义集团进行了坚决斗争的日本前进座剧团团长河原崎虎之助说，我们有毛主席这样伟大的领袖，日本革命一定能胜利。有了毛泽东思想，我们犹如驶向大海的航船，前途无限光明，而修正主义分子正走向泥沼，不久即将沉陷。他说，中国是世界反帝反修斗争的根据地，全世界人民只要坚持毛泽东思想，那末胜利就一定属于人民。
    来自反美斗争最前线的越南南方民族解放阵线代表团的战斗英雄和杀敌勇士们，今天万分幸福地登上天安门城楼，站在伟大领袖毛主席身边。代表团团长、战斗英雄黄文旦非常兴奋地说，毛主席多么健康啊！我们回到越南南方一定把看见毛主席和毛主席的健康情况告诉战斗中的越南南方人民，让他们同享幸福，增长歼美杀敌的力量。
    刚果（布）青年代表团的朋友们见到了毛主席，一遍又一遍地用中国话纵情歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》。代表团团长冈齐阿米激动地说，毛主席不但是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是刚果（布）人民的伟大领袖。他挥动着《毛主席语录》说，每当我们在斗争中遇到困难时，我们就学习这本书，从中汲取鼓舞我们前进的力量。代表团团员山巴、蓬古说，今天我们站在天安门前，站在世界革命中心的中心，见到了毛主席，这对我们是一个极大的鼓舞。毛主席天才地创造性地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，我们深信毛泽东思想放射的万丈光芒，必将照亮全世界。
    正在为反对美帝国主义及其走狗进行武装斗争的来自拉丁美洲的几位反帝战士说，我们这次来中国访问，最大的愿望就是见到伟大领袖毛主席。对于正在进行革命斗争的拉丁美洲的革命人民来说，毛泽东思想是摧毁帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的精神原子弹，我们将永远记住毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，坚持武装斗争的道路，夺取革命斗争的胜利。
    “革命奋勇向前，世界上没有什么可以把它阻挡；伟大的舵手毛主席领航掌舵，革命前程无比辉煌。”这是阿尔巴尼亚诗人依斯玛依尔·卡达莱在他今天写的一首诗：《写在天安门前的颂歌》中的一段热情的赞语。许多朋友象卡达莱一样，看到浩浩荡荡的游行队伍，深深被首都革命群众的无产阶级革命精神所感动，他们热烈赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命对世界革命人民的巨大影响，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会代表团团长莱·培多说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是全世界人民革命斗争的光辉典范，它大大地鼓舞了全世界人民的革命斗争，沉重地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义，沉重地打击了以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，沉重地打击了中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我从心底里支持中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    卢森堡中国友协代表团团长弗兰克说，我被中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就所感动。这次文化大革命对世界革命作出了极大的贡献，它鼓舞了世界革命人民去斗争，它使伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界得到大普及。泰国朋友帕荣·朱拉暖说，目前泰国人民正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行你死我活的武装斗争，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，给了泰国人民的斗争极大的鼓舞。印度尼西亚朋友伊萨说，中国无产阶级文化大革命摧毁了以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，使世界革命的基地中华人民共和国比任何时候都更加鲜红，更加坚强，这是全世界革命人民伟大的历史性的胜利。伊萨说，经历了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安残暴的法西斯统治的印度尼西亚人民进一步认识到：只有走中国革命的道路，走毛主席指出的武装斗争的道路，才能取得革命的胜利。
    一位来自燃烧着武装斗争烈火的非洲朋友说，毛泽东思想是指导非洲人民进行斗争的胜利的保证。处在解放斗争前线的革命人民，从中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利中受到了极大的鼓舞，我们坚决和七亿中国人民并肩战斗，朝着全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席指引的道路，胜利前进！
