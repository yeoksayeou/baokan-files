The east wind is sweeping, the nation is jubilant. As we celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of our nation, the "Long Live Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" revolutionary art exhibition is on display in Beijing. This is a new victory for Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and a new achievement in the revolutionization of art creation.

Over the past year, in the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary artists, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and with revolutionary passion, have on the one hand, taken up their brushes to enthusiastically sing the praises of our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, and the new situation in the Proletarian Cultural Revolution; on the other hand, have used their brushes as weapons to launch a fierce attack on the capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and the reactionary bourgeois line. These revolutionary artworks have played a role in uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general revolutionary front." Revolutionary art creation is a part of revolutionary culture. We should attach importance to and develop revolutionary art creation, and use art forms loved by workers, peasants, and soldiers to propagate the great thought of Mao Zedong, so that revolutionary art will forever be a stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

The East Is Red

In response to Chairman Mao's great call to "Criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight self," we will carry the Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions to implement revolutionary great alliances by system.

    毛主席革命路线的颂歌
    ——“毛主席革命路线胜利万岁”美术作品展览选刊
    东风浩荡，举国欢腾。在我们欢庆建国十八周年的日子里，“毛主席革命路线胜利万岁”革命美术作品展览，在北京展出了。这是毛泽东文艺思想的新胜利，这是美术创作革命化的新成果。
    一年多来，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大工农兵、红卫兵小将和革命美术工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，满怀革命的激情，一方面挥起画笔，热情洋溢地歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，歌颂无产阶级文化大革命中出现的崭新气象；另一方面，以画笔作刀枪，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，向资产阶级反动路线，展开了猛烈的进攻。这些革命美术作品发挥了团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人的战斗作用。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”革命的美术创作是革命文化的一部分，我们应当重视和发展革命美术创作，通过工农兵所喜爱的艺术形式来宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，让革命美术永远成为宣传毛泽东思想的坚固阵地！
    毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
