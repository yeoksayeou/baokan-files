The Mauritanian Islamic Republic President Moktar Ould Daddah, at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, led a Mauritanian delegation to visit China and arrived in Beijing today. President Daddah will bring the deep friendship of the Mauritanian people to the Chinese people. The Chinese people warmly welcome President Daddah and other Mauritanian guests.

The Mauritanian people have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle. For over a hundred years, they have been fighting tirelessly for national independence, resisting the oppression and exploitation of colonialism. After gaining independence in 1960, the Mauritanian people have actively defended their national independence and consistently opposed imperialism and old and new colonialism. They have actively supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and the struggle of African peoples for national independence. Two years ago, to support the Zimbabwean people's struggle for independence, Mauritania severed diplomatic relations with Britain. Recently, Mauritania has also actively supported the Arab people's struggle against American imperialism and its lackey Israel, decisively announcing the severance of diplomatic relations with the United States. The Mauritanian government and people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial just actions have been praised by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world.

Currently, the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people is in a favorable situation. More and more peoples of African colonial countries are taking up arms and embarking on the path of armed anti-imperialist struggle. Those countries that have gained independence are continuously foiling the sabotage and subversion plots of imperialism led by the United States, fighting to maintain national independence and state sovereignty. The storm of anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle is sweeping across Africa. Africa has become a continent of anti-imperialist struggle. No matter how desperately the imperialists struggle and counterattack, they cannot stop the forward march of African history.

The peoples of China and Mauritania have always supported and encouraged each other in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mauritania, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have been continuously developed. Friendly exchanges between the two countries have increased, and cultural and economic exchanges have become more frequent. In February of this year, a Mauritanian government delegation led by Foreign Minister and Planning Minister Bilani Mamadou Wane visited our country and signed economic, trade, and cultural agreements with us. This time, President Daddah personally came to visit China, which is a major development in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Mauritania.

The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Mauritania are based on the principles of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and therefore can withstand the test of time. The continuous development of our friendly and cooperative relations not only serves the interests of the peoples of the two countries but also helps to further strengthen the united struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa against imperialism.

The Mauritanian guests are visiting our country at a time when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, aims to uproot revisionism from the root, ensuring the consolidation and strengthening of our proletarian dictatorship and socialist system. Through the Cultural Revolution, socialist China will become even stronger, enabling us to more effectively support the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, support the struggles of Asian and African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and better fulfill our internationalist duties.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said in a conversation with Asian, African, and Latin American friends in May 1960: "Our common enemy is American imperialism. We are all on the same front, and we all need to unite and support each other." The peoples of China and Mauritania, the Chinese people and the African peoples, will forever stand on the same front against imperialism and colonialism, unite, and fight together.

We are confident that President Daddah's visit will further enhance the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania, deepen our mutual understanding, and promote the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. Long live the everlasting friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania! Long live the continuous development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Mauritania!

　　热烈欢迎毛里塔尼亚贵宾
    毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国总统莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫，应我国周恩来总理的邀请，率领毛里塔尼亚代表团，前来我国访问，今天到达北京。达达赫总统将给中国人民带来毛里塔尼亚人民的深厚友谊。中国人民热烈欢迎达达赫总统和毛里塔尼亚其他贵宾们的光临。
    毛里塔尼亚人民有着反帝反殖斗争的光荣传统。一百多年来，他们为争取民族独立，反抗殖民主义的压迫和剥削，进行了不懈的斗争。一九六○年取得独立以后，毛里塔尼亚人民积极维护民族独立，坚持反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义。他们积极支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争和非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争。两年前，为了支持津巴布韦人民争取独立的斗争，毛里塔尼亚断绝了同英国的外交关系。最近，毛里塔尼亚又积极支持阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略，断然宣布同美国断交。毛里塔尼亚政府和人民的这些反帝反殖的正义行动，得到了亚非人民和世界人民的赞扬。
    目前，非洲人民的反帝斗争形势大好。越来越多的非洲殖民地国家的人民拿起武器，走上了武装反帝斗争的道路。那些取得独立的国家，不断地粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的破坏颠覆阴谋，为维护民族独立和国家主权而斗争。反帝反殖的斗争风暴，正在席卷非洲。非洲已经变成了一个反帝的、战斗的大陆。不管帝国主义者怎样疯狂挣扎和反扑，都阻挡不了非洲历史车轮的前进。
    中毛两国人民在反帝反殖的斗争中，从来都是互相支持，互相鼓舞的。自从中毛两国建交以来，我们两国之间的友好合作关系，不断地得到了发展。两国之间的友好往来，日益增多，文化经济的交流，日趋频繁。今年二月，以外交兼计划部长比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼为首的毛里塔尼亚政府代表团访问我国，与我国签订了经济、贸易和文化协定。这一次达达赫总统又亲自来中国访问，这是中毛两国友好合作关系的重大发展。
    中毛两国的友好合作关系，是建立在反帝反殖和和平共处五项原则的基础上的，因此是经得起时间的考验的。我们两国友好合作关系的不断发展，不但符合两国人民的利益，而且也有利于进一步加强亚非各国人民的团结反帝事业。
    毛里塔尼亚的贵宾们，是在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时刻，前来我国进行友好访问的。由我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是要从根本上挖掉修正主义的根子，保证巩固和加强我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。经过文化大革命，社会主义中国将变得更加强大，能够更有效地支援世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，支援亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，更好地履行我们的国际主义义务。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席一九六○年五月在接见亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲朋友的谈话中说：“我们共同的敌人是美帝国主义，我们大家都是站在一条战线上，大家需要互相团结互相支持。”中毛两国人民，中国人民和非洲人民，将永远站在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的一条战线上，团结起来，共同战斗。
    我们深信，达达赫总统的这次访问，必将进一步增进中毛两国人民的友谊，加深我们相互之间的了解，促进中毛两国的友好合作关系。祝中毛两国人民的友谊万古长青！祝中毛两国友好合作关系不断发展！
