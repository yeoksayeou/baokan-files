Old Cooks Recall the Past

Chinese Khrushchev says that capitalists exploiting workers is "not only guiltless but also meritorious," that they have "historical merits," that "today it is not that exploitation is too much, but too little," and that "the suffering of workers and peasants lies in the fact that no one is exploiting them." Hearing these black words, we were so enraged that our lungs nearly burst.

The four of us are all from impoverished peasant backgrounds. In the dark old society, we all had similar miserable experiences: some of our fathers were beaten to death by landlords and Japanese devils; or our mothers were driven mad by landlords, our elder brothers were tormented to death by diseases, our younger brothers were forced to sell themselves due to landlord debts, and our younger sisters were forced into child marriages; some of us started working for landlords at the age of seven, herding sheep, doing odd jobs, and enduring endless exploitation and oppression...

In the old society, the world was as black as crows. The tigers on Dongshan wanted to eat people, and the tigers on Xishan were the same. Landlords and capitalists were all heartless. The four of us were ruined by the exploiting classes, forced to leave our homes, and ended up in Shanghai working as cooks. We cooked lavish banquets, but we ate "garbage and kitchen scraps." One foot was inside the door, and the other was outside. We were like drifting clouds and flowing water, kicked in and kicked out by the boss. If he needed us, we worked for a few days; if not, he closed the business. In the old society, our lives were insecure, and politically, we had no status. We swallowed our bitter tears and shed tears of sorrow. We hated the exploitative system that devoured people, and we hated all the exploiting classes. Exploitation is a crime, and it deserves to die a thousand deaths!

Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense is entirely helping landlords and capitalists deceive us laboring people. He dreams of restoring capitalism in China, but this is a thousand times impossible! A million times impossible! We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and vow to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    老炊事员话当年
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么资本家剥削工人“不但无罪，而且有功”，是有“历史功劳”的，“今天不是剥削太多，而是太少了”，“工人、农民的痛苦在于没有人剥削他们”。听了这些黑话，真把我们的肺都气炸了。
    我们四个人都是贫苦农民出身，在黑暗的旧社会里都有着相类似的苦难遭遇：有的父亲活活地被地主和日本鬼子打死；或者母亲被地主逼疯，哥哥被病魔折磨死，幼弟被地主的债务逼得出卖，幼妹被逼做童养媳；有的七岁替地主放羊，当短工，受尽了地主的剥削和压迫……。
    旧社会，天下乌鸦一般黑，东山老虎要吃人，西山老虎同样要吃人。地主、资本家都是蛇蝎心肠。我们四个人被剥削阶级搞得家破人亡，背井离乡。到上海当做饭师傅，烧的是丰盛的酒宴，吃的是“垃圾泔脚”，一只脚踏在门槛内，一只脚踏在门槛外，好似乱砧黄石，被老板踢进踢出，用得着就叫你干几天，用不着就停生意。在旧社会里，我们生活无保障，政治上更没有地位。苦水往肚咽，泪水往外流。我们恨透了人吃人的剥削制度，恨透了一切剥削阶级，剥削就是有罪，剥削就是罪该万死！
    中国赫鲁晓夫的一套鬼话，完全是帮地主、资本家的忙，欺骗我们劳动人民。他梦想在中国复辟资本主义，这一千个办不到！一万个办不到！我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
