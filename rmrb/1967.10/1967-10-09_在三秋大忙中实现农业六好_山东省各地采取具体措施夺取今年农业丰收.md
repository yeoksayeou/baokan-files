In the midst of the autumn busy season, various localities in Shandong Province are taking concrete measures to achieve six good practices in agriculture and secure a bumper harvest this year.

The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee's Production Command Department held a meeting on September 28 to study and discuss the editorial "Achieving Six Good Practices in Agriculture During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" published in the People's Daily. The meeting pointed out that achieving six good practices in agriculture is a crucial measure to further implement Chairman Mao's great strategic directives of "ensuring grain production, ensuring cotton production, and ensuring cloth production" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." All levels of production command departments, broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres in rural areas must study it seriously and carry out the spirit of the editorial in the current autumn busy season work.

To ensure that rural areas throughout the province can truly achieve six good practices in agriculture, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee's Production Command Department has also taken some specific measures. The command department requires that county-level and above leadership organs during the autumn busy season must hold fewer meetings or no meetings at all, so as to concentrate on production, harvesting, seed selection, procurement, distribution, and storage work. Provincial, prefectural, and county-level organs must dispatch a large number of cadres to go deep into the communes and production brigades, propagate Chairman Mao's great strategic directives, and provide specific assistance to the communes and production brigades in achieving six good practices in agriculture. Revolutionary cadres in rural areas should go to the production front lines, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, dare to take the lead, and take responsibility seriously to achieve new successes in leading the masses to realize six good practices in agriculture. Workers in all sectors, especially in industry, commerce, and finance, must exert themselves to do a good job in supporting agriculture and contribute to the realization of six good practices in agriculture.

Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various parts of Shandong Province have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, actively participated in the autumn busy season activities, and are determined to achieve six good practices in agriculture during the autumn busy season. In the Jiaodong Peninsula, where autumn harvesting and planting are in full swing, each county and commune, in addition to further strengthening and reinforcing the production leadership cadre team, has organized more than 8,000 cadres to go to the production front lines with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job in the autumn busy season production. In the cotton-producing areas of Liaocheng and Huimin, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, after studying the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "ensuring grain production, ensuring cotton production, and ensuring cloth production," said that grain, cotton, and cloth are related to the lives of people across the country and are related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." We guarantee that we will not drop a single grain or a single cotton boll, and we will achieve bumper harvests.

    在三秋大忙中实现农业六好
    山东省各地采取具体措施夺取今年农业丰收
    新华社济南八日电　山东省各级领导机关、广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，正在采取措施，做到农业六好，夺取今年农业全面丰收。
    山东省革命委员会生产指挥部九月二十八日召开会议，认真学习和讨论了《人民日报》社论《在无产阶级文化大革命中做到农业六好》。会议指出：做到农业六好，是当前进一步贯彻毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针的一项极其重要的措施。各级生产指挥部、广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，必须认真学习，把社论精神贯彻到当前“三秋”工作中去。
    山东省革命委员会生产指挥部为了保证广大农村切实做到农业六好，还采取了一些具体措施。指挥部要求县以上领导机关在“三秋”大忙期间，一定做到少开会和不开会，以便集中精力搞好生产、收割、选种、征购、分配、保管等工作。省、地、县三级机关，都要抽调大批干部，深入社队，宣传毛主席提出的伟大战略方针，具体帮助社队做到农业六好。农村革命干部要到生产第一线，虚心向贫下中农学习，大胆领导，认真负责，在领导群众实现农业六好中立新功。各行各业特别是工交、财贸部门的革命职工，要鼓足干劲，做好支援农业的工作，为实现农业六好贡献力量。
    山东各地广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，热烈响应党中央的号召，积极投入“三秋”活动，决心在“三秋”大忙中实现农业六好。正在忙于秋收秋种的胶东半岛，各县、社为加强“三秋”生产的领导，除进一步充实和加强生产领导班子外，已经组织了八千多名干部到生产第一线和广大贫下中农一起搞好“三秋”生产。棉花集中产区的聊城、惠民等地广大贫下中农和革命干部，学习了伟大领袖毛主席的“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的指示后说，粮、棉、布关系到全国人民的生活，关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”。我们保证把丰收的粮食和棉花，一粒不掉，一朵不丢，丰产丰收。
