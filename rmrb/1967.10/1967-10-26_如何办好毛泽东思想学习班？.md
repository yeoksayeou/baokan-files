Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's "fight self and criticize revisionism" policy, East China Normal University has already held more than sixty Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over two thousand people participating in the study. The students in the classes have earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest directives, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, and promoted the resumption of classes and the revolution. Recently, many study classes have made preliminary summaries, drawing six common points of experience. These points of experience are:

First, the study classes must use the "Three Articles" as the basic textbooks, overthrow the "self," and thoroughly reform one's worldview. Comrades from the Political Education Department said that one cannot fight selfishness with selfishness. Only by using the "Three Articles," which embody the most complete and thorough proletarian worldview, can one reform oneself and break away from selfishness to establish public-mindedness.

Second, fighting selfishness should not be about solving some small issues but should focus on one or two fundamental issues that are urgently needed to be solved in the current deepening of the proletarian cultural revolution. These issues should be raised to the level of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, in order to raise class consciousness, political thought level, and revolutionary awareness. The revolutionary young people from the Chinese Department said that if one goes to criticize revisionism with the "self," not only will one not hit the target, but one might also slip into the quagmire of revisionism.

Third, one must closely combine fighting selfishness with criticizing revisionism. Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism are two inseparable aspects of one thing. The members of the Educational Department's cadre study class, in conjunction with criticizing China's Khrushchev's poisonous weeds such as "On Party Struggles," purged the poison of "self" in their minds. In this way, they both criticized revisionism and fought selfishness, without engaging in any "everyone passes" nonsense.

Fourth, study classes with a concentration of intellectuals must "go out" and "invite in," and learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Foreign Language Department's study class invited an old worker who had suffered greatly in the old society to give a report. The old worker poured out his boundless class feelings of love for the Party and Chairman Mao, giving many students a vivid class education lesson.

Fifth, adhere to the principle of self-education and self-liberation. Many graduates, after studying, began to establish the idea of going to hard places and to where the motherland needs them the most, to serve the people wholeheartedly. Some revolutionary cadres in leadership positions, through study, broke away from the self-satisfied thought of "revolution to the top."

Sixth, study classes must always pay attention to correctly handling some relationships. For example, in handling the relationship between criticism and self-criticism, one should mainly engage in self-criticism and, on the basis of self-criticism, carry out criticism. In handling the relationship between leaders and the masses, leaders should take the lead, and the masses should urge the leaders, helping each other. In handling the relationship between inside and outside the study class, one should closely link with the movement and not engage in the "closed-door reflection" routine.

Now, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of this school are vigorously studying Chairman Mao's latest directives in the study classes, further summarizing the experiences and lessons of the study classes, criticizing China's Khrushchev and his henchmen's revisionist educational line, and striving to launch a new high tide of educational revolution.

    如何办好毛泽东思想学习班？
    华东师大总结出六点体会
    以“老三篇”为基本教材，狠抓世界观的改造；抓住当前迫切需要解决的一两个根本性问题，提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识；要把斗私和批修紧密结合起来；要“跑出去”，“请进来”，拜工农兵为师；坚持自己教育自己、自己解放自己的原则；要经常注意正确处理一些关系问题。
    据新华社上海二十五日电　在伟大领袖毛主席“斗私，批修”方针的指引下，华东师范大学已经举办了六十多个毛泽东思想学习班，共有二千多人参加学习。学员们在学习班里认真地活学活用毛主席著作，大学大用毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，推动了复课闹革命。最近，不少学习班作了初步的小结，得出了六点共同的体会，这些体会是：
    第一，学习班必须以“老三篇”为基本教材，斗倒“私”字，狠抓世界观的改造。政教系的同志说，不能以私斗私，只有用体现最完整、最彻底的无产阶级世界观的“老三篇”来改造自己，才能破私立公。
    第二，斗私不能就事论事地解决一些小问题，而应该抓住当前深入开展无产阶级文化革命迫切需要解决的一两个根本性问题，提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度上来，才能提高阶级觉悟、政治思想水平和革命的自觉性。中文系的革命小将们说，带着“私”字去批修，不但打不中要害，自己还有可能滑到修正主义的泥坑中去。
    第三，要把斗私和批修紧密结合起来。斗私批修，这是一件事情的不能割裂开来的两个方面。教育系干部学习班的学员，结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的《论党内斗争》等大毒草，来肃清“私”字在自己头脑中的流毒，这样既批了修，又斗了私，而又不是搞什么“人人过关”。
    第四，知识分子成堆的学习班一定要“跑出去”，“请进来”，拜工农兵为师。外语系的学习班，请在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人做了报告。老工人向大家倾吐了对党和毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，给很多同学上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。
    第五，坚持自己教育自己，自己解放自己的原则。许多毕业生经过学习，开始树立起到艰苦的地方去，到祖国最需要的地方去，全心全意为人民服务的思想。一些担任领导工作的革命派，在学习中破除了“革命到顶”的自满思想。
    第六，学习班要经常注意正确处理一些关系问题。例如，在处理批评与自我批评的关系时，要以自我批评为主，在自我批评的基础上开展批评。在处理头头与群众的关系时，首先要头头带头，群众促头头，相互帮助。在处理学习班内外关系时，要密切联系运动，不搞“闭门思过”那一套。
    现在，这个学校的无产阶级革命派正在学习班中狠抓对毛主席最新指示的学习，进一步总结学习班的经验教训，批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙的修正主义教育路线，为掀起教育革命的新高潮而努力。
