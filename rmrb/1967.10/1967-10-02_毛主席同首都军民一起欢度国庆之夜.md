Chairman Mao Celebrates National Day with Capital Military and Civilians

Chairman Mao, with a vigorous stride, ascended the Tiananmen Gate Tower once again. Amidst the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" on the tower, Chairman Mao smiled and shook hands with comrades and friends from the five continents and various responsible persons from our country.

The festive fireworks on Tiananmen Square soared into the sky one after another. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing "The East is Red" with all their hearts, expressing their shared vow: "Chairman Mao! We are infinitely loyal to you. We will definitely carry out your instructions without any deviation, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and achieve greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production."

New China News Agency, October 1st: Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, ascended the Tiananmen Gate Tower again tonight to celebrate National Day with 500,000 military and civilian personnel in the capital and to watch the festive fireworks.

At 9 p.m. sharp, Chairman Mao, with a vigorous stride, ascended the solemn and majestic Tiananmen Gate Tower. Amidst the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" on the tower, Chairman Mao smiled and shook hands with comrades and friends from the five continents and various responsible persons from our country. At the same time, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses on the square looked up at Tiananmen, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically cheering, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" and singing "The East is Red" over and over again.

Joining our great leader Chairman Mao and various responsible comrades on the Tiananmen Gate Tower to participate in the evening event were revolutionary comrades and friends from many countries on the five continents. Among them were: Alia, head of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, and Numazale, head of the Congolese National Revolutionary Movement and Government Delegation. Also present were Li Qingyi, head of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Party and Government Delegation, and Huang Wenhuan, deputy head. Additionally, there were representatives from the Burmese Communist Party Central Committee, the Vietnamese South National Liberation Front, the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee, the New Zealand Communist Party, the Pakistani Government Friendship Delegation, the Tanzanian Friendship Delegation, and the Office of the President of Mali, among others.

On the Tiananmen Gate Tower, participating in the evening event were other central leaders and responsible persons such as Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yun, Dong Biwu, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Fuzhi, Li Xuefeng, Song Renqiong, Jiang Qing, Liu Ningyi, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, Chen Boda, and Ye Qun, among others.

Premier Zhou Enlai also frequently shook hands and had friendly conversations with revolutionary comrades and friends from many countries on the five continents, expressing gratitude for the revolutionary friendship they brought from the peoples of various countries. The tower was filled with a warm atmosphere of revolutionary unity.

The Tiananmen Square on National Day was brightly lit, like daytime. The festive fireworks soared into the sky one after another, instantly filling the sky with red clouds and vibrant colors. Fireworks such as "Bumper Harvest" and "Adding Flowers to Brocade" formed magnificent patterns, making the night sky of the capital dazzling and magnificent. The loudspeakers continuously broadcasted powerful and melodious revolutionary songs. The singing and cheering echoed, wave after wave, dancing and singing endlessly, expressing their boundless love and deep affection for Chairman Mao. The workers, peasants, and soldiers, immersed in boundless joy, along with the Red Guards and revolutionary students, expressed their shared vow to the great leader Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao! We are infinitely loyal to you, infinitely loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and infinitely loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. We will definitely carry out your instructions without any deviation, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate our firepower, and concentrate our targets. From a political, ideological, and theoretical standpoint, we will thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev. We will develop and consolidate the revolutionary alliance and the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination,' launch a larger-scale 'support the army and love the people' campaign, 'seize the revolution and promote production,' and achieve greater victories in the revolution and production."

Among the festive crowd, there were hundreds of Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams. These cultural cavalry and revolutionary masses from various grassroots units brought their own creations from the struggle. These programs were concise, rich, and full of revolutionary fighting spirit. Songs and dances such as "The East is Red" and "People of the World Love Chairman Mao" expressed the fervent feelings of our military and civilians and people of the world who love the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. Programs such as "Down with China's Khrushchev," "March of the Red Guards," "Learn from the PLA," "Labor Songs," and "Celebrating Revolutionary Unity" fully demonstrated the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. Programs such as "Anti-Imperialism and Anti-Revisionism," "Fighting Vietnam," and "People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America Want Liberation" fully expressed the firm will of our broad military and civilians to oppose imperialism and revisionism and support the just struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The festive programs also included excerpts from excellent modern revolutionary plays such as "The Red Lantern," "The Battle of the White Tiger Regiment," and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy."

The National Day celebration, with Tiananmen Square as the center, also held festive fireworks evenings at the Workers' Stadium and Tsinghua University. The festive activities continued until late into the night.
