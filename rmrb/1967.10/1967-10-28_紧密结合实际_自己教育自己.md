The Red Star Tractor Factory in Guizhou Holds Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes, Achieving Great Success and Gaining Rich Experience

The Red Star Tractor Factory in Guizhou has held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, achieving great success and gaining rich experience. The factory's revolutionary committee began the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class on April 21st. By now, they have completed nine sessions. A total of 460 workers, technicians, and cadres have participated, accounting for more than half of the factory's workforce. Through their studies, the broad masses of workers have transformed their non-proletarian thoughts, raised their ideological and political levels, and closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to seize the revolution and promote production. They have consolidated and developed revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, making both revolution and production flourish. The entire factory presents a thriving scene and has become an advanced unit in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism in the Guiyang area.

How did the Red Star Tractor Factory successfully hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes?

Masses Run, Masses Teach, Masses Learn

Initially, some comrades in the factory believed that to successfully hold a study class, one must first find someone who not only studies Chairman Mao's works well but also has a certain level of cultural and theoretical knowledge to serve as a lecturer.

Is it necessary to have a lecturer to successfully hold a study class? The factory revolutionary committee, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes," "The people have boundless creativity," and "Only the people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history."

The "Sixteen Points" point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can only be carried out by the masses liberating themselves, and cannot adopt any method of substitution." "In this great revolutionary movement, the masses must educate themselves to distinguish what is right and what is wrong, what methods are correct and what methods are incorrect."

Chairman Mao's teachings and the instructions in the "Sixteen Points" made the members of the factory revolutionary committee's minds clear: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is to help the masses and cadres better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, raise their ideological and political levels, promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, solve various problems, and make the Cultural Revolution even better. Therefore, it is necessary to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and the regulations of the "Sixteen Points" to rely on the masses to hold study classes, allowing the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves through studying Chairman Mao's works.

With a clear understanding, the factory revolutionary committee decided to adopt the mass line method of masses run, masses teach, and masses learn to hold the study classes. Each session of the study class is organized by revolutionary mass organizations. The students are also teachers. Whoever studies Chairman Mao's works with questions, practices self-criticism, criticizes revisionism well, and promotes revolution and production well, is elected by everyone to give a lecture. The study class guides the students to summarize these advanced thoughts and experiences in a timely manner, study them seriously, and then let the students take them back to their workshops and departments to practice. In this way, the study class is closely linked with the actual struggle, playing a promoting role in the movement. Many students deeply feel that the study class is a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a good place to exchange and summarize struggle experiences, and a new battlefield for criticizing selfishness and revisionism, which is very good.

Close to Reality, Learn in Struggle, Apply in Struggle

Each session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class at the Red Star Tractor Factory focuses on the current situation and tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the actual situation of the factory. It guides the students to bring the problems and living thoughts from the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines to study, discuss, and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively, always insisting on learning in struggle and applying in struggle. The specific method is: first, read with questions; second, compare with actual thoughts, launch an attack on the "self" in one's mind; third, discuss the essence of the problem, raise ideological and political levels; fourth, practice in class struggle and work and production practice, apply and verify; fifth, summarize successful experiences, learn from lessons, improve, and then practice in struggle. Because the study class is closely linked with the actual struggle and thoughts, it grasps the major issues and essential issues, making the learning center prominent, learning and applying simultaneously, and focusing on the "apply" aspect. Therefore, the problems are solved more solidly, effectively promoting the in-depth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire factory.

With the development of the revolutionary situation, the revolutionary great unity needs to be further consolidated and developed. At this time, the Mao Zedong Thought study class, according to the factory's struggle reality, targets the living thoughts in the revolutionary great unity, organizes the students to study the "Three Old Articles" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." During the study, many revolutionary workers shared their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, following the formula of "unity - criticism and self-criticism - unity," correctly treating the deceived masses, and doing their ideological work well; some revolutionary workers checked and examined their wrong attitudes towards the deceived masses. Through the study, everyone realized: The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also needs to liberate all of humanity, paying attention to uniting with all those who can be united. They summarized seven experiences of uniting the majority, which were then promoted. Thus, the proletarian revolutionaries took the initiative to do ideological work, more enthusiastically and patiently helping the deceived comrades return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Correctly treating cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. For a period, some revolutionary workers in the factory, influenced by the anarchist trend of thought, had the tendency to "reject everything and overthrow everything" towards cadres. The Mao Zedong Thought study class guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and related discussions on cadre issues, as well as relevant editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily." Everyone realized: The focus of this movement is to rectify those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road. For cadres who have made mistakes, one should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and implement the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." With improved understanding, everyone carefully analyzed the cadres' class background, distinguished between enemies and ourselves, treated them differently, and enthusiastically helped the cadres who had made mistakes to correct their mistakes, lighten their burdens, and achieve new successes in seizing the revolution and promoting production. In this way, the majority of cadres were gradually united. Currently, more than 95% of the cadres in the entire factory have united around the factory revolutionary committee. Most of them have participated in revolutionary mass organizations, and some have been elected as members of the revolutionary committee. The revolutionary three-in-one combination has been further consolidated and developed.

The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines must be reflected among the workers. For a period, under the influence of the anarchist trend of thought in society, some workers could not see the situation clearly, could not distinguish right from wrong, and temporarily deviated from the direction of the struggle, directing their arrows at the revolutionary committee, this new thing; some did not consider the overall situation and established their own factions. The factory revolutionary committee, after thorough investigation and research, believed that the main reason they were influenced by the anarchist trend of thought was that the "self" was at work in their minds. Therefore, they organized them to enter the study class, study and apply Chairman Mao's "Three Old Articles," "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," and related editorials extensively, and carry out the "Two Remembrances and Three Investigations" activities. The vast majority of comrades with wrong views quickly awakened through study, touched their souls, and launched an attack on the "self" in their minds.

Fighting the "self" to better criticize revisionism

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Fighting the 'self' is to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the 'self' in one's mind. Criticizing revisionism is to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and fight against the handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road. These two things are interconnected. Only by thoroughly fighting against the 'self,' can one better carry out the struggle against revisionism to the end."

The practice of the Mao Zedong Thought study class at the Red Star Tractor Factory in Guizhou fully proves that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are completely correct. The students, through the study process, fought against the "self" fiercely, and also criticized revisionism deeply. For example, after some students fought against their selfish thoughts on the cadre issue, they were more powerful in criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small area" in the cadre issue of the Chinese Khrushchev.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the battle cry of "fighting the 'self' and criticizing revisionism," the Mao Zedong Thought study class at the Red Star Tractor Factory paid more attention to fighting the "self" while criticizing revisionism, determined to take "fighting the 'self' and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, make the study class better, and turn the entire factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    贵州红星拖拉机厂毛泽东思想学习班取得好经验
    紧密结合实际　自己教育自己
    广大革命职工通过学习，提高了思想政治水平，革命和生产都搞得很好
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州红星拖拉机厂举办毛泽东思想学习班，获得了很大的成绩，取得了丰富的经验。
    这个厂的革命委员会从四月二十一日开始举办第一期毛泽东思想学习班，到目前为止，已办到第九期了；参加学习班学习的工人、技术人员、干部有四百六十多人，占全厂职工人数的一半以上。广大职工通过学习，改造了头脑里的非无产阶级思想，提高了思想政治水平。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，抓革命、促生产，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，革命和生产都搞得很好，全厂呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象，成为贵阳地区斗私批修的一个先进单位。
    红星拖拉机厂是怎样办好毛泽东思想学习班的呢？
      群众办，群众教，群众学
    起初，厂里有的同志认为，要办好学习班，必须先找一个不仅毛主席著作学得好，而且要有一定文化水平和理论水平的人来担任讲师。
    一定要有讲师才能办好学习班吗？厂革命委员会带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作，学习了十六条。
    毛主席教导我们说：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力。”“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    十六条指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，只能是群众自己解放自己，不能采用任何包办代替的办法。”“要让群众在这个大革命运动中，自己教育自己，去识别那些是对的，那些是错的，那些做法是正确的，那些做法是不正确的。”
    毛主席的教导和十六条上的指示，使厂革命委员会成员的头脑豁然开朗：在无产阶级文化大革命运动中举办毛泽东思想学习班，是为了帮助群众和干部更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，提高思想政治水平，促进人的思想革命化，解决各种问题，把文化大革命搞得更好。因此，必须按照毛主席的教导和十六条的规定，依靠群众来办学习班，让群众通过学习毛主席著作，来自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    认识明确了，厂革命委员会就决定采取群众办、群众教、群众学的群众路线方法来办学习班。每一期学习班，都由革命群众组织派人负责做组织工作。学员既是学生，又是先生。谁带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，批判修正主义搞得好，谁抓革命促生产搞得好，大家就推选谁上台“讲课”。学习班引导学员把这些先进思想、先进经验及时加以总结，认真学习，然后让学员带回班组和科室去实践。这样，就使学习班和实际斗争紧密联系起来，对运动起了推动作用。许多学员深有体会地说：学习班是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，是交流和总结斗争经验的好场所，是斗私批修的新战场，好得很。
  结合实际，在斗争中学，在斗争中用
    红星拖拉机厂毛泽东思想学习班每一期的学习内容，都紧密结合当前无产阶级文化大革命运动的形势、任务和本厂的实际，引导学员带着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的问题和活思想，大学、大讲、大用毛主席著作，始终坚持在斗争中学，在斗争中用。具体作法是：一读，带着问题读毛主席的书；二对照，对照思想实际，向自己头脑中的“私”字开火；三议论，议论问题的实质，提高思想政治水平；四实践，到阶级斗争和工作、生产实践中去运用、检验；五总结，总结成功的经验，吸取教训，加以提高，然后再到斗争中去实践。学习班由于紧密联系斗争实际和思想实际，抓住了大的问题，抓住了实质问题，学习中心突出，边学边用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，因此，解决问题比较扎实，有力地促进了全厂无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展。
    随着革命形势的向前发展，革命的大联合需要进一步地巩固和发展。这时，毛泽东思想学习班便根据厂里的斗争实际，针对革命大联合中的活思想，组织学员学习了“老三篇”和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。学习中，不少革命职工介绍了自己活学活用毛主席著作，按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，做好他们的思想工作的体会；有些革命职工则对照检查了自己对待受蒙蔽群众的错误态度。通过学习，大家认识到：无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类，要注意争取团结一切可以团结的人。他们总结出了七条团结大多数的经验，加以推广。于是无产阶级革命派人人动手做思想工作，更热情、更耐心地帮助受蒙蔽的同志，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题。有一段时期，这个厂的一些革命职工由于受到无政府主义思潮的影响，存在着对干部“排斥一切，打倒一切”的思想倾向。毛泽东思想学习班就引导大家学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和有关干部问题的论述，以及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》有关社论。大家认识到：这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。对犯有错误的干部，则要按照毛主席的教导，实行“惩前毖后，治病救人”的政策。认识提高了，大家对干部认真进行阶级分析，分清敌我，区别对待，热情帮助犯过错误的干部改正错误，轻装前进，在抓革命、促生产中立新功。这样，逐步团结了干部的大多数。目前，全厂百分之九十五以上的干部都已团结在厂革委会的周围，多数人先后参加了革命群众组织，有的还被选为革委会的成员，革命的三结合得到了进一步巩固和发展。
    两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，必然要反映到职工中来。有一段时期，在社会上无政府主义思潮影响下，有的职工看不清形势，分不清是非，一度背离了斗争大方向，把矛头指向革命委员会这个新生的事物；有的不顾大局，另立山头。厂革委会经过深入细致的调查研究，认为他们之所以受无政府主义思潮影响，主要是“私”字在头脑中作怪。于是便组织他们进学习班，活学活用毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》等光辉著作，学习有关社论，同时开展“两忆”、“三查”活动。绝大多数持有错误观点的同志，经过学习很快觉醒过来，狠触灵魂，向自己头脑中的“私”字开火。
    斗掉“私”字，才能更好地批修
    林彪副主席说：“斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的‘私’字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”
    贵州红星拖拉机厂毛泽东思想学习班的实践，充分证明林彪副主席的指示完全正确。学员们由于在学习过程中狠斗“私”字，批修也批得深透。例如有些学员狠斗了自己在对待干部问题上的私心杂念以后，在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线时，就勇猛有力。
    在伟大领袖毛主席发出“斗私，批修”的战斗号令以后，红星拖拉机厂毛泽东思想学习班更加注意一面斗私，一面批修，决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，把学习班办得好上加好，把全厂办成毛泽东思想大学校。
