Young salesclerks are severely oppressed and persecuted under the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique. The commercial sector in the Soviet Union is a typical example. According to Soviet publications, "a store manager can make the future of dozens of young people bleak," and "store leaders often easily" frame young salesclerks for their own corrupt and illegal activities.

As a result, many young people quit their jobs at the counter within a year. According to Soviet publications, one-fifth of all commercial workers in the Soviet Union change jobs every year. The following are a few cases of young salesclerks who were forced to leave their jobs from 1966 to 1967, which clearly show the oppression and persecution of young people by the Soviet privileged class.

Valia Klyuchikova, aged 20, said: "I really wanted to be a salesclerk. After graduating from a commercial school, I was assigned to the 15th branch of the city's fruit and vegetable store. As soon as I arrived, there was a shortage of money. I couldn't explain the reason for the shortage. The store administration office asked me to compensate for the money, and I cried. I affirmed that I hadn't taken the money. They didn't believe me, so I had to quit my job."

Svetlana Antoshina, aged 19, said: "I used to work at the first branch of the city's fruit and vegetable store. I worked at the counter for a total of four months. At first, things were fine, but suddenly 140 rubles were missing. I paid part of the money. Now, I am suspended from work because I can't take it anymore..."

Ushkina Zina, now 18 years old. Her neighbor Yefimova said: "This girl is very good and honest. She didn't go to work because she couldn't make up for the shortage. She often told me about this, crying bitterly, and then left in despair."

Tanya Fedotova, 18 years old, her parents introduced: "The youngest daughter worked in the 33rd branch of the city's food store for a few months. Often there was no income. Later, someone told her that she was short 100 rubles. The father paid for her, but at the family meeting it was decided that she must quit her job to avoid misfortune."

    青年售货员备受欺压迫害
    在苏修集团统治下的苏联，广大劳动青年备受资产阶级特权阶层的欺压和迫害。苏联的商业部门就是个典型的例子。据苏联报刊透露，“一个商店经理能使数十个青年的前途暗淡”，“商店领导人经常不费力地”把他们干的营私舞弊坏事，嫁祸青年营业员。
    正因如此，许多青年人站柜台不到一年就改行了。据苏联报刊统计，全苏商业工作人员每年要更换五分之一。从下边几个一九六六年至一九六七年被迫离职的青年售货员的遭遇，可以清楚地看出苏联特权阶层对青年的摧残和压迫。
    瓦利亚·克柳奇科娃，现年二十岁，她说：“我很想做一个售货员。我从商业学校毕业后，被分配到本市水果蔬菜商店第十五门市部工作。一到那里就开始短钱。我不能讲清短钱的原因。商店行政办公室要我赔钱，我哭了，我证实，我没有拿钱。人家不相信，我只好离职。”
    斯维特拉娜·安托希娜，现年十九岁。她说：“我曾在市水果蔬菜商店第一门市部工作。我一共站了四个月的柜台。开始时情况还好，但突然少了一百四十个卢布。我付出了一部分钱。现在，我停职了，因为我受不了……”
    乌什基娜·齐娜，现在十八岁。她的邻居叶菲莫娃说：“这个小姑娘很好，很诚实，她之所以不去工作，因为不能再弥补短款。她常给我谈起这件事，她痛哭流涕，然后是绝望地离去。”
    费多托娃·塔尼亚，十八岁，她的父母介绍说：“小女儿在市食品商店第三十三门市部一共工作了几个月。往往得不到收入。以后有人对她说，她短了一百卢布的款。父亲给她支付了，但在家庭会议上决定，她必须离职，以免遭到不幸。”
