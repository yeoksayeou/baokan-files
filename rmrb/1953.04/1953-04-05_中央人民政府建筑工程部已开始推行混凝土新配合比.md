    Ministry of Building Construction of the Central People's Government Begins to Promote New Concrete Mix Proportion

    Letter from the Ministry of Building Construction of the Central People's Government: Comrade Sun Qingping's suggestion published in your newspaper on March 2 regarding the promotion of new concrete mix proportions is correct. Since this year, the Ministry has adopted the Soviet standard numbering method for design and has used weight ratios (converted to volume ratios) and aggregate gradation in concrete mixing. In terms of construction, the Ministry has obtained the consent of the former directly affiliated engineering company (now renamed Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau) to conduct studies on the use of standard concrete measures in the winter training classes for construction workers and the training classes for cadres. After the commencement of construction at various sites this year, Beijing will be the focus of testing, and after experience is gained, it will be fully promoted.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央人民政府建筑工程部已开始推行混凝土新配合比
    中央人民政府建筑工程部来信：三月二日你报刊登孙氰萍同志关于推行混凝土新配合比的建议是正确的。本部自本年度起已经采用苏联标号办法进行设计，在混凝土配合方面已采用重量比（换算成体积比）及掺合料的级配。在施工方面，本部已征求得原直属工程公司（现改为北京市建筑工程局）的同意，在建筑工人冬训班和干部训练班中进行使用标号混凝土措施的学习。本年度各工地开工后，即以北京市为重点进行试验，俟取得经验后即将全面推广。
