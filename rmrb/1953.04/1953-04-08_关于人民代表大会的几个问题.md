    Editor's Note: The Central People's Government Committee's resolution on convening the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels has aroused enthusiastic response across the country. Many readers have encountered some questions in studying and publicizing this resolution and have requested answers. A selection of answers to these questions is published below.

    Q: What is the system of the People's Congress?
    A: The system of the People's Congress is the fundamental political system of our country. It stipulates that the people use universal suffrage to elect people's congresses at all levels as organs for the people to exercise state power. People's congresses at all levels elect people's governments at all levels as organs for the people to exercise state power during the adjournment of the people's congresses. The highest organs of state power are the National People's Congress and the Central People's Government elected by it.

    Q: What are the characteristics of the system of the People's Congress?
    A: First, it can more widely mobilize the broad masses of the people to participate in the management of state power, which can further embody the nature of our country's state power belonging to the people. Second, it implements the principle of democratic centralism, which can both extensively promote democracy and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to make resolutions and entrust the government to lead the masses in their implementation. Third, it is both a deliberative body and a working body. Representatives can not only discuss and decide on state and local affairs, but also actually participate in the implementation of decisions and resolutions. This ensures the realization of the people's will. Fourth, representatives are elected by the people through universal suffrage and are subject to the supervision of the people, and can be recalled and re-elected by the voters at any time. This ensures that representatives must obey the will of the people. In short, it is the most convenient for the people to exercise their political power, prevent and overcome bureaucracy, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Q: Why were the People's Congresses not convened in the past three years?
    A: Because the conditions at that time were not yet met, it was necessary to take some transitional measures.

    Q: What conditions are required to convene the People's Congress?
    A: According to the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: three conditions are required: the complete end of military operations, the thorough realization of land reform, and the full organization of the people. At present, on a nationwide scale, military operations on the mainland have completely ended; land reform has been completed except for a few areas; people from all walks of life have been organized and their political awareness has been greatly improved. The national economic situation has also fundamentally improved. Thus, the conditions for implementing universal suffrage and convening the People's Congress are already in place. Therefore, the 20th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee resolved to convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels in 1953.

    Q: What transitional measures have we taken in the past three years?
    A: There are two measures: First, at the central level, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, formulated the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, elected the Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China, and entrusted it with the functions and powers of exercising state power. Second, at the local level, people's representative conferences at all levels gradually exercised the functions and powers of people's congresses at all levels.

    Q: What is the difference between the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the National People's Congress?
    A: The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an organizational form of the Chinese people's democratic united front. It is a voluntary combination of various democratic parties and people's organizations, etc. Its purpose is to unite all democratic classes and nationalities in the country through this unity, and work together to realize New Democracy. It is not a political power organization. The National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power. It is the organ representing state power.

    Q: What is the difference between the People's Congress and the People's Representative Conference of All Circles?
    A: The representatives of the People's Congress are elected by the people through universal suffrage; the representatives of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles are elected separately by people from all circles, and a portion of them are invited by the People's Government. This is the difference between the two in the method of generating representatives. The People's Congress is the organ for the people to exercise state power; the People's Representative Conference of All Circles is a consultative body of the People's Government. Only when it exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress on its behalf does it become a transitional organ of political power.

    Q: Will the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference continue to exist after the National People's Congress is convened?
    A: It will continue to exist. Because, throughout the entire period of the New Democratic Revolution, there must be a united front of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and there must be an organization of this united front to unify the will of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and consolidate the great revolutionary unity of the people. However, after the National People's Congress is convened, it will no longer exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress on its behalf, but may submit proposals to the National People's Congress or the Central People's Government on fundamental plans or important measures related to national construction. Based on this situation, the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will be subject to necessary and appropriate revisions.

    Q: Will the People's Representative Conference of All Circles continue to exist after the People's Congress is convened?
    A: It will no longer continue to exist.

    Q: Before the People's Congress is convened, is it necessary to continue to convene the People's Representative Conference of All Circles?
    A: Before the People's Congress is convened, various localities must also convene the People's Representative Conference of All Circles on time to discuss the work that must be discussed. At the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Election Committee on the work of universal suffrage, the various preparatory tasks for universal suffrage should be discussed, the great significance of convening the People's Congress should be explained, the masses of the people should be mobilized to care about this major event, and actively participate in the election.

    关于人民代表大会的几个问题
    编者按：中央人民政府委员会关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议公布之后，在全国引起热烈的响应。很多读者在研究和宣传解释这个决议中遇到了一些问题，提出要求解答。现将一部分问题的解答发表于后。
    问：人民代表大会的制度是什么？
    答：人民代表大会的制度是我国的基本政治制度，它规定人民用普选方法产生各级人民代表大会，作为人民行使政权的机关，各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府，作为各级人民代表大会闭会期间人民行使政权的机关。国家最高政权机关为全国人民代表大会和它所选出的中央人民政府。
    问：人民代表大会的制度有什么特点？
    答：第一，它能够更广泛地发动广大人民参加国家政权的管理，这样就可以进一步体现我国国家政权属于人民的性质。第二，它实行民主集中制的原则，既可广泛发扬民主，又能集中群众的智慧，作成决议，交付政府领导群众执行。第三，它既是议事的机关，也是工作的机关，代表不但能够讨论、决定国家和地方的事务，而且能够实际参与决定、决议的执行。这样就能保证人民意志的实现。第四，代表由人民用普选方法产生，并受人民的监督，可以随时由选民撤回补选，这样就能保证代表必须服从人民的意志。总之，它最便利于人民行使自己的政治权力，防止和克服官僚主义，巩固人民民主专政。
    问：为什么在过去的三年中不召开人民代表大会？
    答：因为当时的条件还不具备，故必须采取一些过渡的措施。
    问：召开人民代表大会需要什么条件？
    答：根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的规定：需要军事行动完全结束、土地改革彻底实现、人民有充分组织这样三个条件。目前，就全国范围说，大陆上军事行动已经完全结束；土地改革除少数地区外，已经完成；各界人民已经组织起来，并已大大提高了政治觉悟。国家经济状况也已根本好转。这样，实行普选召开人民代表大会的条件已经具备。因此，中央人民政府委员会第二十次会议决议在一九五三年内召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会。
    问：三年来，我们采取了些甚么过渡措施？
    答：其措施有二：一、在中央，由中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议执行全国人民代表大会职权，制定中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法，选举中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会，并付之以行使国家权力的职权。二、在地方，由各级各界人民代表会议逐步地代行地方各级人民代表大会的职权。
    问：中国人民政治协商会议与全国人民代表大会有何区别？
    答：中国人民政治协商会议是中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式，是各民主党派和各人民团体等的自愿结合，其目的在于通过这种团结，去团结全国各民主阶级和各民族，共同努力，实现新民主主义。它不是政权组织。而全国人民代表大会则是国家政权的最高机关，它是代表国家的权力机关。
    问：人民代表大会与各界人民代表会议有何区别？
    答：人民代表大会的代表由人民用普选方法产生；各界人民代表会议的代表，是由各界人民分别选举产生，其中并有一部分由人民政府邀请。这是二者在代表产生方法上的区别。人民代表大会是人民行使国家政权的机关；各界人民代表会议则是人民政府的咨询机关，只有在它代行了人民代表大会职权时，才成为过渡性的政权机关。这是二者在性质上的区别。
    问：召开全国人民代表大会后，中国人民政治协商会议是否继续存在？
    答：继续存在。因为，在新民主主义革命的整个时期，既有各民主党派和各人民团体的统一战线，就要有这种统一战线的组织，用以统一各民主党派和各人民团体的意志，巩固人民的革命大团结。但在全国人民代表大会召开以后，它就不再代行全国人民代表大会的职权，但可就有关国家建设事业的根本大计或重要措施，向全国人民代表大会或中央人民政府提出建议案。根据这种情况，中国人民政治协商会议组织法将作必要的、适当的修改。
    问：召开人民代表大会后，各界人民代表会议是否继续存在？
    答：不再继续存在。
    问：没有召开人民代表大会以前，是否需要继续召开各界人民代表会议？
    答：各地在召开人民代表大会以前，还须按时召开各界人民代表会议，讨论必须讨论的工作。在各界人民代表会议上，应按照中央选举委员会关于普选工作的指示，讨论普选的各项准备工作，说明召开人民代表大会的伟大意义，动员人民群众关心这件大事，并积极参加选举。
