Tianjin County is a county with relatively superior production conditions, but the Tianjin County Committee of the CCP has long relaxed its leadership over agricultural production. Some cadres of the CCP Tianjin County Committee and the Tianjin County Committee of the Communist Youth League (Zheng Rutian, Zhang Wenxuan, Dai Guoqiang, Li Ming, Guo Yongchang, Ma Baoxiang) expressed strong dissatisfaction with this and wrote a letter to this newspaper on February 26th this year, while simultaneously lodging a complaint with the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee. After receiving the complaint, the North China Bureau immediately sent people to Tianjin County to conduct a special investigation and confirmed that the Tianjin County Committee had indeed neglected this year's spring plowing production, technical skills had not been taught, fertilizers were not prepared, the supply of agricultural tools lacked organization, and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams had not been seriously rectified. The problem was very serious. County committee members did not go to the countryside and simply complained that the CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee did not provide enough leadership to them, thereby causing serious losses to their work. According to the North China Bureau's inspection report of March 16th, Tianjin County has the following pressing problems in agricultural production leadership that need to be resolved:

(1) The county's 1953 production increase targets and specific plans for increasing production have not been determined. County, district, and village cadres generally reflect that "agricultural production has no direction and no plan." The farmers' "reliance on the government" mentality is very serious and widespread. Farmers in paddy fields have thoughts such as "If the state does not loan fertilizer, paddy fields cannot be planted" and "If fertilizer is not loaned, they will become dry fields." The leadership failed to criticize and educate them in a timely manner and solve the problem by formulating plans and tapping the potential for production, which once caused ideological confusion. According to statistics from districts 1, 2, 7, and 6, farmers plan to convert 35,000 mu of paddy fields into dry fields, and district 7 plans to convert nearly half of the paddy fields into dry fields.

(2) About 70% of the paddy fields in the county lack fertilizer, and the canal maintenance project involving 1.55 million cubic meters of earth still has no competent authority. The annual agricultural loan figure has not been finalized, and not a single cent has been loaned. Farmers urgently need agricultural tools such as waterwheels, water dragons, and new-style walking plows, but there has been no preparation for them. Mass accumulation of fertilizer, fertilizer preparation, harrowing to preserve moisture, repair of agricultural tools, and exchange of seeds are all in a serious state of laissez-faire.

(3) The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have impure organizations, unclear directions, are undemocratic, have no plans, and have an unconsolidated foundation, requiring vigorous rectification. Around the beginning of April, the county will need 9,000 migrant workers to participate in river construction in distant places; in addition, the county's paddy field maintenance and canal repair projects will require nearly half of the male labor force to be invested in various water conservancy constructions (requiring 60 days). It is necessary to rectify the organization in a planned and focused manner and seriously solve the contradiction between spring plowing, spring planting, and spring labor in order to ensure timely planting.

(4) Important departments leading agricultural production cannot play a leading role. For example, the agricultural supply station has not resolved its capital and leadership relations for more than a year and is still无人管 (no one in charge). The six local state-owned farms are unable to play the exemplary role of state-owned farms in cultivating and disseminating fine seeds. Bank cadres are all conducting anti-bureaucracy struggles in the city and do not go to the countryside to work. There are also many problems in the business policy of supply and marketing cooperatives. The Party committee has long relaxed its leadership over economic departments.

(5) The leadership of county and municipal departments is not unified. Municipal departments deploy work without including rural work; therefore, each department is busy with its own central work, and no one is leading agricultural production. Cadres in district 6 reflect: assistant specialists are specialized, departments are systematized, and the district head is trivialized. The county committee shouts "production overrides everything," but the result is "everything overrides production."

The North China Bureau's inspection report pointed out that the main reasons for the above serious problems are as follows:

1. The secretary and members of the CCP Tianjin County Committee sit in the office to lead agricultural production and have not inspected agricultural production in the countryside once in more than a year. District cadres criticized the county committee, saying: the county committee's leadership methods are meetings, reports, telephones, and numbers; the methods of promoting work are resolutions, instructions, and orders; the county committee's written instructions say that production does not miss the season, but in reality, they are divorced from the season and in a complete mess. Last year, the crops in the fields had already been harvested before Tianjin began to organize cadres to go to the countryside to lead appraisals; three days before the ground froze, the instructions for autumn plowing reached the districts.

2. The county committee adopted an indifferent attitude towards the agricultural production of more than 300,000 farmers; they only complained that the municipal committee did not lead and did not actively and proactively go deep into the countryside to discover and solve problems, emphasizing objective difficulties. The county committee did not properly inspect, summarize, absorb experience, and learn lessons from the agricultural patriotic production increase campaign and winter agricultural production in 1952. Much of the agricultural production work was "planned, but without results."

3. The Agricultural Committee of the CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Government did not provide specific instructions or specific leadership for agricultural production in Tianjin County. The county committee's requests often did not receive replies for a long time. For example, the 1953 agricultural production increase plan and the agricultural production cooperative and mutual aid team rectification plan were sent to the Municipal Agricultural Committee around September 1952, but have not been approved. The capital and leadership relations of the agricultural supply station, as well as agricultural loans and other issues, have been requested several times, but have not been resolved to this day. These have directly affected the preparatory work for various agricultural productions in 1953.

After the inspection by the North China Bureau, the Tianjin County Committee held a three-level cadre meeting of county, district, and village on March 5th and 6th, criticized various incorrect thoughts of the cadres, and deployed spring plowing and spring planting work. Thirty-one cadres were drawn from the county-level organs to form working groups to go deep into the villages to specifically help the districts and villages carry out work, and to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural production office. The county committee also combined the anti-bureaucracy to inspect the leadership of production work.

However, the leadership problem of agricultural production in Tianjin County is not solved just like that. According to Liu Ning, the district head of the fourth district of Tianjin County, in a letter to this newspaper on April 3rd, after the three-level cadre meeting of county, district, and village in Tianjin County deployed spring plowing and spring planting work, the county armed forces department convened a meeting of the armed forces ministers of each district to deploy a universal "militia test." The militia takes tests and scores every night, continuously for half a month, without combining it with the central work; when the village wants to convey the content of the three-level cadre meeting, it cannot gather people (most of the young and middle-aged people are militia). The supply and marketing cooperative and the agricultural supply station also do not cooperate with each other. The supply and marketing cooperative only sells soap, perfume, Kun socks, handkerchiefs, masks, and other items, and never sells means of production. The agricultural supply station is "sitting in the office," piling up agricultural tools in the office, neither going to the countryside nor having sales branches in each township. Many farmers want to buy agricultural tools and agricultural tool parts, but have nowhere to buy them. The masses often have to go to Tianjin city to buy a waterwheel leather money, running hundreds of miles to buy it. New-style walking plows are not allowed on public buses. District and village cadres and the masses have repeatedly suggested that the supply and marketing cooperative and the agricultural supply station implement the method of entrusting district and village supply and marketing cooperatives to sell on their behalf, but the agricultural supply station is always afraid of trouble and afraid that the "procedures will be in chaos" and is unwilling to do so. Rural theater troupes also lack unified leadership, and most of their economic sources rely on indiscriminate apportionment; it has already reached the spring plowing season, but the theater troupes are still performing everywhere, delaying agricultural time; when performing, they also steal the state's high-voltage electricity. Judging from these situations, the problems in the leadership of rural work in Tianjin County are still very serious.

### 中共天津县委严重忽视领导农业生产  经中共中央华北局检查后已有改变但仍存在不少问题

    中共天津县委严重忽视领导农业生产
    经中共中央华北局检查后已有改变但仍存在不少问题
    天津县是一个生产条件比较优越的县份，但是天津县委长期地放松了对农业生产的领导。中共天津县委和青年团天津县委一部分干部（郑汝田、张文轩、代国强、李明、郭永昌、马宝祥）对此深表不满，曾于今年二月二十六日写信给本报，并同时向中共中央华北局提出控告。华北局接到控告后，立即派人到天津县专门进行调查，证实天津县委对今年春耕生产确很忽视，技术未传授，肥料无准备，农具供应缺乏组织，农业生产合作社和互助组没有认真整顿，问题十分严重。县委委员不下乡，单纯埋怨中共天津市委对他们领导不够，因此使工作受到严重损失。据华北局三月十六日的检查报告中说，天津县在农业生产领导方面有以下几个急待解决的问题：
    （一）全县一九五三年增产指标及增产具体计划没有确定，县、区、村干部普遍反映“农业生产无方向、无计划”。农民“依赖政府”思想十分严重而且普遍。稻田区农民有“国家不贷肥，稻田无法种”，“不贷肥变旱田”等思想，领导方面未能及早批判教育，通过订计划、挖掘生产上的潜在力加以解决，因而一度造成思想混乱。据一、二、七、六四个区统计，农民准备把稻田变旱田三万五千亩，七区准备把将近二分之一的稻田变为旱田。
    （二）全县稻田区有百分之七十左右缺乏肥料，有一百五十五万方土的渠道岁修工程还没有主管机关。全年农贷数字未最后确定，且分文未贷。农民紧迫需要水车、水龙、新式步犁等农具，却没有任何准备。群众积肥、备肥、耙地保墒、农具修理、调换种籽，都处于严重的自流状态。
    （三）绝大部分农业生产合作社和互助组，组织不纯，方向不明，不民主，无计划，基础不巩固，需要大力整顿。四月初前后，全县要有九千个民工到远处参加河工；再加本县稻田岁修和整修渠道工程，使将近二分之一男劳动力要投入各种水利建设中去（需六十天时间）。必须有计划有重点地整顿组织，认真解决春耕、春种和春工矛盾问题，才能保证适时下种。
    （四）领导农业生产的重要部门，不能起领导作用。如农业供应站一年多来资金和领导关系都未解决，到现在仍无人管。六个地方国营农场都起不了国营农场应有的示范和培育、传播良种的作用。银行干部全部在市内进行反官僚主义斗争，不下乡工作。供销合作社业务方针方面也有不少问题。党委对经济部门的领导是长时期放松的。
    （五）县市各部门领导不统一。市内各部门布置工作，没有农村工作一项；所以各部门忙于部门中心工作，农业生产无人领导。六区干部反映：助理员专业化，各部门系统化，区长事务化。县委口喊
    “生产压倒一切”，结果是“一切压倒生产”。
    华北局的检查报告中指出：发生以上严重问题的主要原因有以下几点：
    一、中共天津县委书记、委员坐在机关里领导农业生产，快一年多没有到农村检查过一次农业生产。区干部批评县委说：县委领导方法是开会、汇报、电话、数字；推动工作的方法是决议、指示、命令；县委文字指示是生产不误季节，实际上是脱离季节，一塌糊涂。去年地里庄稼已收拾完了，天津才开始组织干部下乡领导评比；上冻前三天，秋耕指示才到达各区。
    二、县委对三十多万农民的农业生产，采取漠不关心的态度；只是埋怨市委不领导，自己不积极地主动地深入农村发现问题，解决问题，强调客观困难。对于一九五二年全年的农业爱国增产运动和冬季农业生产，县委都没有很好地检查总结，吸取经验，接受教训。农业生产工作很多是“有计划，没结果”。
    三、中共天津市委农委、市人民政府对天津县农业生产没有具体指示，具体领导。县委的请示往往长时期得不到答复。如一九五三年农业增产计划，农业生产合作社、互助组整顿计划，在一九五二年九月前后就送给市委农委，一直没有批。农业供应站的资金和领导关系问题以及农贷等问题，请示了数次，到现在未得到解决。这些都直接影响了一九五三年各种农业生产的准备工作。
    经过华北局检查以后，天津县委在三月五、六日召开了县、区、村三级干部会议，批判了干部的各种不正确的思想，布置了春耕、春种工作。在县级机关抽调了三十一个干部，组织工作组，深入乡村具体帮助区、村进行工作，并加强对农业生产办公室的领导。县委也结合反官僚主义检查了领导生产工作。
    但是，天津县农业生产的领导问题，并不是这样就算解决了。据天津县第四区区长刘宁四月三日给本报来信说，天津县县、区、村三级干部会议布置了春耕、春种工作以后，县武装部却又召集各区武装部长开会，布置普遍进行“民兵测验”。民兵天天晚上测验评分，连续半月，不结合中心工作；村里要传达三级干部会议的内容，就召集不起人来（青壮年大都是民兵）。供销合作社和农业供应站也是互不配合。供销合作社只卖胰子、香粉、坤袜子、手帕、口罩等物品，从来不卖生产资料。农业供应站是“座堂办公”，把农具堆在机关，既不下乡，在各乡也没有推销分处。很多农民想买农具和农具零件，无处可买。群众要买个水车皮钱，也往往得到天津市去，跑百十里路才能买到。买上新式步犁，公共汽车上又不准带。区村干部和群众再三提意见，要求供销合作社和农业供应站实行委托区、村供销合作社代卖的办法，农业供应站总是怕麻烦，怕“手续乱了”，不愿这样做。农村剧团也缺乏统一的领导，大部分的经济来源是靠滥行摊派；已到了春耕时期，剧团还在到处演戏，违误农时；演戏时还偷接国家的高压电。就这些情况来看，天津县的农村工作领导方面的问题还是很严重的。
