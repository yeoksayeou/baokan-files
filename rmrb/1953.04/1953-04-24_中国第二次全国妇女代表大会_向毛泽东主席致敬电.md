    China's Second National Women's Congress
    Message of Respect to Chairman Mao Zedong

Respected Chairman Mao:

    As we set off from all parts of the country to attend the Second National Women's Congress of China, we were entrusted by the broad masses of women to convey their respect to you, inquire after your health, and express their boundless love, gratitude, and trust in you. They also wanted us to report to you, through this congress, the many exciting developments and existing problems in their production, work, and lives, and especially to listen to your instructions.

    Our Second National Women's Congress, in the spirit of fully exchanging views and gradually resolving problems, discussed and summarized the achievements and experiences of the women's movement in the four years since the First National Women's Congress, and formulated the tasks of the women's movement during the national construction period. All the delegates to the congress unanimously believe that thanks to your leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, with the great victory of our people's revolution and the development of national construction, the status of women has undergone fundamental changes, and women have obtained equal rights with men. The facts of the past four years fully prove that any achievement of the women's movement is inseparable from your wise leadership and warm concern. All the delegates to the congress unanimously pledge to, under your leadership and that of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government you lead, truly immerse ourselves in the masses, improve our working methods, pay attention to opposing bureaucracy at all times, overcome commandism, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, so as to more closely unite the women of the whole country, further improve our existing work achievements, and contribute greater strength from our women to the great construction of the motherland and the victory of world peace and democracy.

    Finally, we respectfully wish you good health! Your health is the greatest happiness for us and all the Chinese people.

                All Delegates to the Second National Women's Congress of China
                                        April 23
