    Nanjing Xinhua Daily News: The state-owned Jiangsu Province Department Store Company's Nanjing Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station implemented an economic accounting system in the fourth quarter of last year. On the one hand, it reduced inventory to save funds, and on the other hand, it freely purchased goods according to consumer needs to fully supply the market, which significantly accelerated commodity circulation.
    In order to vigorously promote inventory goods, the cadres of the Nanjing Wholesale Station first overcame the biggest obstacle to compressing inventory – "brand name thinking" – and tried to use slow-selling goods to replace popular goods of equal quality. When the popular imported granulated sugar was in short supply, they sold more than 700,000 jin of long-term stockpiled "Pomegranate Flower" granulated sugar. More than 1,500 reams of imported drawing paper had been in storage for five or six months without moving, so the salesmen mobilized customers to use this paper to replace the heavily weighted domestic drawing paper that was in short supply. Now more than 95% has been sold. In this way, inventory levels dropped sharply towards reasonable figures, and were reduced by about 50% in just three months.
    The cadres of the Nanjing Wholesale Station realized that implementing the economic accounting system did not mean unilaterally compressing inventory, but also required planned and free procurement of goods to fully supply market needs, in order to accelerate commodity circulation. They made a realistic commodity circulation plan and requested large-scale allocation from higher authorities. However, the current free requisition of goods is completely different from the previous blind allocation. The figures for each important commodity are determined after serious investigation and responsible thinking, and through mass discussion. For example, when discussing the allocation of Northeast book paper, some people frowned and said, "It has always been difficult to sell, don't order it!" Checking historical data, this was indeed the case. But one salesman said, "It was difficult to sell before because its price was high and its quality was not good; now this kind of paper is of good quality and low price, and it sells very well!" The planning meeting held by the manager and relevant personnel from the planning and business departments often resulted in disputes over a single commodity, and in the end, a more accurate figure was always determined based on various materials and research.
    With reasonable inventory and vigorous promotion, the circulation speed of goods has been significantly accelerated. The circulation speed in December last year exceeded the speed for the entire year. The average circulation speed in January and February of this year also exceeded the average circulation speed of last year. In the past, sugar had to be turned over every hundred days or so, but in January of this year, according to business conditions, it only took 64 days; if calculated according to the business situation in February, it could be turned over once in 33 days. The average turnover days for newsprint last year was 220 days, but calculated according to the business situation in February this year, it was only 50 days.

### 一面大力推销库存商品，一面根据需要放手进货  南京百货批发站的商品流转速度显著加快

    一面大力推销库存商品，一面根据需要放手进货
    南京百货批发站的商品流转速度显著加快
    南京新华日报消息：国营江苏省百货公司南京采购供应批发站从去年第四季度实行经济核算制，一面压缩库存以节约资金，一面根据消费者的需要放手进货，以充分供应市场，商品流转速度显著地加快了。
    南京批发站的干部为了大力推销库存商品，首先克服了压缩库存的最大障碍——“名牌思想”，尽可能用冷背货代替同等质量的畅销货。畅销的进口砂糖不多了，他们便将长期积压的七十多万斤榴花砂糖卖了出去。一千五百多令进口道林纸进仓五、六个月没有动，推销员就动员顾客用这种纸代替供不应求的重磅国产道林纸，现在已卖出百分之九十五以上。就这样，库存量向着合理数字直线下降，不过三个月，就压缩了百分之五十左右。
    南京批发站的干部认识到实行经济核算制不等于片面地压缩库存，还应该有计划地放手进货，充分供应市场需要，以加速商品流转。他们做出了切合实际的商品流转计划，要求上级大量调拨。但是现在的放手要货，和从前的盲目调拨毫无相同之处。每一个重要商品的数字，都是经过认真的调查研究和负责的思考，并通过群众讨论定出来的。例如讨论调拨东北书籍纸时，有些人皱着眉头说：“一向不好卖，不要！”查查历史资料，的确也是这样。但有一个营业员说：“先前不好卖，那是因为它的价钱高、质量不好；现在这种纸物美价廉，销路很好！”经理和计划、业务部门有关人员所举行的计划会议，常因一种商品发生争执，最后总是根据各种材料，研究决定出一个较为准确的数字。
    库存合理了，加上大力推销，商品的流转速度显著加快了。去年十二月的流转速度超过全年的速度。今年一、二月份的平均流转速度也超过去年的平均流转速度。食糖过去要一百多天周转一次，到今年一月份，就营业情况计算，只要六十四天；如按二月份营业情况计算，三十三天就能周转一次。新闻纸去年的平均周转天数是二百二十天，以今年二月份营业情况计算，只有五十天了。
