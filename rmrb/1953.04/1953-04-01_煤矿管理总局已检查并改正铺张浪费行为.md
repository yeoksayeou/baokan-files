    The Coal Mining Administration has inspected and corrected extravagant and wasteful behavior
    Letter from the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government: The People's Daily published on February 12th a letter from Comrade Wu Li exposing the extravagant and wasteful behavior of the Coal Mining Administration. After inspection, the situation is basically correct.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of coal mining work, the Central Government reorganized the original Coal Mining Administration into the North China Coal Mining Bureau and re-established the Coal Mining Administration. When the administration was established, in the work of purchasing office supplies and various equipment, it simply emphasized completing the procurement tasks, without considering the rational use of state funds, resulting in the purchase of two desks worth 1.8 million yuan, 1,000 wire beds, and spending 100 million yuan on musical instruments.

    Now the Coal Mining Administration has adjusted various equipment that is not suitable for use by the agency, for example, it has transferred 1,000 iron beds to the Northeast Workers' Sanatorium and the Beidaihe Coal Miners' Sanatorium.

    The reasons for the above-mentioned waste are primarily that we have not thoroughly implemented the state financial system, lacked planning in preparatory work, and held extravagant and wasteful ideas. Relevant personnel of the Coal Mining Administration have realized the seriousness of the problem and ensure that similar mistakes will not be made in the future.

### 煤矿管理总局已检查并改正铺张浪费行为

    煤矿管理总局已检查并改正铺张浪费行为
    中央人民政府燃料工业部来信：人民日报二月十二日登载吴礼同志揭露煤矿管理总局铺张浪费行为的来信。经检查，情况基本上是正确的。
    中央为了加强对煤矿工作的领导，将原来的煤矿管理总局改组为华北煤矿管理局，重新成立煤矿管理总局；总局成立时，在购买办公用品和各种设备的工作中，单纯强调完成采购任务，没有考虑合理使用国家资金，以致购买了价值一百八十万元的办公桌两张、钢丝床一千张，并花了一亿元买乐器。
    现在煤矿管理总局已将不适合本机关使用的各种设备加以调整，例如已把一千张铁床转让给东北职工疗养院和北戴河煤矿工人疗养院。
    产生上述浪费现象的原因，首先在于我们对国家财政制度贯彻不够，对筹备工作上缺乏计划性，有铺张浪费思想。煤矿管理总局有关人员已认识到问题的严重性，保证今后不再犯类似错误。
