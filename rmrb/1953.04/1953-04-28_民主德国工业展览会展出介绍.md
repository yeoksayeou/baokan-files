	The exhibition features world-renowned German glass products and various precision instruments, including a set of water distillation equipment, quartz glassware, spherical glass connectors, chemical experimental instruments, and optical experimental instruments, including a metal spectroscope with an accuracy of one ten-thousandth of a centimeter. There are also telescopes and various microscopes, eyeglasses, medical instruments, especially instruments for internal organ dissection, sound movie projectors, and Chinese typewriters.

	At the exhibition, you can see various insulating porcelain materials and electrical equipment, including various medical instruments used for major surgeries, one of which is a surgical knife that uses electric sparks to operate, saving the patient from bleeding. In addition, there are various electric lights for coal mines and ships, various generators, automatic telephone exchanges, teletypewriter-style transceivers, railway signal control consoles, etc.

	The range of light industrial products on display is very wide.
