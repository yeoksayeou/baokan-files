Attending the meeting were the President of the Republic, Antonín Zápotocký, Prime Minister Viliam Široký, and members of the National Assembly. Also present were the Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, V.A. Bogomolov, the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China, Tan Xilin, and other diplomatic envoys from People's Democratic countries.

    The meeting was opened by the Chairman of the National Assembly, O. John. The meeting first approved a number of decrees recently promulgated and implemented by the government. Next, Prime Minister Široký, on behalf of the government, delivered a report on domestic and foreign policies. Široký pointed out: The Czechoslovak people, adhering to the immortal teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and inheriting the legacy of K. Gottwald, must unite more closely and, under the leadership of President Zápotocký, continue to advance along the socialist path. Regarding domestic policy, Široký stated that the government of the Czechoslovak Republic guarantees to continuously develop industrial production, particularly the major industrial sectors such as metallurgy, coal mining, ore extraction, power, machine manufacturing, and chemicals, with the great assistance of the Soviet Union; to strengthen unified agricultural cooperatives economically and organizationally, to attract more working farmers to participate in cooperatives, and to ensure a steady transition of the countryside to large-scale socialist production; to continuously improve the living standards of the working people, and to consolidate the people's democratic regime. Regarding foreign policy, Široký said: The government of the Republic will continue to follow the Leninist-Stalinist doctrine that peaceful coexistence is possible between two different systems, capitalism and socialism, and fully agrees with the position of the Soviet government recently expressed by Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, that "at present, there are no disputes or outstanding issues that cannot be peacefully resolved on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned." Široký further said: Our government supports the proposal of the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the resumption of the Korean armistice negotiations. This new peaceful measure taken by the Chinese and Korean governments points out a practical and feasible way to achieve an armistice and end the Korean War, and opens the way to consolidate peace and security in the Far East and the world. Široký concluded by saying: The example of the Soviet Union has given us firm confidence in our own strength. In solving all problems, our government will take the welfare of the people and their happy socialist future as the highest criteria, in accordance with the immortal teachings of Lenin and Stalin.

    After discussions, the National Assembly unanimously approved Prime Minister Široký's report and expressed its complete confidence in the government headed by Široký.
