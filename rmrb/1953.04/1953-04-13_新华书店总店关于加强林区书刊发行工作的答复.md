    Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters' Reply on Strengthening Bookstore Distribution Work in Forest Areas
    Letter from Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters: The suggestion made by Comrade Sun Degong in the March 24th report regarding strengthening bookstore distribution work in forest areas is excellent. We have already notified the Northeast General Branch to summarize its existing experience in serving forestry workers in order to promote it to other forest areas; and we have instructed the Eastern Inner Mongolia Branch of the General Branch to pay attention to the distribution work in forest areas and to quickly designate a specific organization to be responsible for carrying out this work.

    新华书店总店关于加强林区书刊发行工作的答复
    新华书店总店来信：三月二十四日报载孙德功同志关于加强林区书刊发行工作的建议很好。我们已通知东北总分店把为林业工人服务的已有经验进行总结，以便向其他林区推广；并让该总分店指示内蒙古东部区分店重视林区的发行工作，迅速指定一定组织负责进行此项工作。
