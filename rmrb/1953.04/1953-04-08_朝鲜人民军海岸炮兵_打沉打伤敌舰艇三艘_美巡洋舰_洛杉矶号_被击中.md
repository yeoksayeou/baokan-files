Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: The Kim Yu-man coastal artillery unit of the Korean People's Army, fighting in the East Coast area, successively sank an enemy minesweeper and damaged two enemy destroyers in two days in mid-March.

On the morning of March 16, an enemy minesweeper No. 16, using the morning mist as cover, approached a certain coastline on the east coast and fired recklessly at the shore. The vigilant People's Army coastal sentries, when they saw the minesweeper approaching from a distance, sent the signal "Enemy ship discovered" to the gunners of the Kang Young-cheol company of the Kim Yu-man coastal artillery unit. The gunners immediately loaded the guns and prepared for battle. As soon as the enemy ship entered the firing range, they fired a test shot at it, and the shell exploded not far behind the enemy ship. Then, many guns fired fiercely at the enemy ship at the correct angle and distance. Rain-like shells fell on and around the enemy ship. The enemy ship tried to escape. However, in an instant, many shells hit the enemy ship, and the battered enemy ship soon sank.

The next day, March 17, two enemy destroyers, No. 767 and No. 558, appeared on the sea off the east coast, attempting to retaliate. The artillerymen immediately fired more than 40 shells at the enemy ships with giant coastal guns, causing smoke and fire to erupt from the enemy ships' gun emplacements. The two enemy ships quickly turned around and fled at full speed to avoid being sunk.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Associated Press: The US Navy Headquarters admitted on the 3rd that the US cruiser "Los Angeles" was "hit by shells from the Communist army" outside Wonsan Port on April 2nd. The US escort ship "Hamner," which was indiscriminately bombarding the Wonsan area together with the "Los Angeles," was also "hit by fragments of a shell that exploded in the air." The Associated Press said that this was the "second time in seven days that the Los Angeles" had been hit, the last time the ship was hit was on March 27.

    【新华社平壤七日电】战斗在东海岸地区的朝鲜人民军金如万海岸炮区分队，在三月中旬的两天中，接连打沉了敌扫雷艇一艘，打伤了敌驱逐舰两艘。
    三月十六日早晨，敌十六号扫雷艇一艘以早晨的云雾作掩护，驶近东海岸某处海岸线，向岸上肆行射击。警觉的人民军海岸哨兵在这艘扫雷艇从远处驶来时，就把“发现敌艇”的信号传给了金如万海岸炮区分队康英哲连的炮手们。炮手们立即推弹入膛，准备战斗。敌艇一进入火力圈，他们就向它试发一炮，炮弹在敌艇后面不远处爆炸了。接着，许多门炮以正确的角度与距离，一齐向敌艇猛烈轰击。雨点似的炮弹纷纷落在敌艇的上面及其周围。敌艇企图逃跑。但是，瞬息间，就有许多发炮弹打中了敌艇，被打得遍体鳞伤的敌艇不久就下沉了。
    第二天，三月十七日，敌七六七号和五五八号两艘驱逐舰出现在东海岸外面的海面上，企图前来报复。炮兵们立即用巨型的海岸炮向敌舰集中发射了四十多发炮弹，把敌舰上的炮台打得冒出了烟火。这两艘敌舰赶紧掉头，开足马力逃跑，才没有被击沉。
    【新华社七日讯】据美联社东京电透露：美国海军总部三日承认，美国巡洋舰“洛杉矶号”于四月二日在元山港外被“共军的炮弹击中”。和“洛杉矶号”一起向元山地区滥肆轰击的美国护航舰“汉姆拿号”也被“空中爆炸的一枚炮弹的碎片打到”。美联社说：“洛杉矶号”这次是“在七天中第二次被击中”，该舰上一次被击中的日期是三月二十七日。
