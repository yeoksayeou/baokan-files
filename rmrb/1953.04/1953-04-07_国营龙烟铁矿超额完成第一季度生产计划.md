    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, April 6th: The state-owned Longyan Iron Mine exceeded its first quarter production plan for this year by 2.263%. The mine's production task for this year is 66% higher than in 1952. The main reason for the overfulfillment of the first quarter production task this year is that the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the mine carried out a thorough campaign to learn from the deeds of Huang Jiguang among all employees. Through study and discussion meetings and report meetings, the various units of the mine greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the vast number of employees. After studying the heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang, the workers of the drill team in the East Mining Department used their brains to find tricks and first changed the furnace into a bucket shape, making it less prone to coal running and concentrating the firepower, which can save the country 72 tons of coal a year. In the past, individuals worked alone, busy all day long, and the quality was not guaranteed. Now, they have switched to assembly line operations, with each person responsible for their own tasks, which not only guarantees the quality but also increases production efficiency by 80%. The employees of the Mechanical and Electrical Branch put forward the slogan "Learn from Huang Jiguang, eliminate all defective products," which reduced the waste rate of cast mine car wheels from 30% in the past to 3% now. Zhao Shuangyue's team in the Mining Department used their brains to change the drilling operation, which increased output and created the mine's highest record of 10.53 tons per worker efficiency. In March, the team overfulfilled the entire month's mining task by 101% in nineteen days. The East Mining Department overfulfilled the entire month's production plan for March in twenty-one days. As of the end of March, in addition to making up for the production tasks lost in January, the Longyan Iron Mine overfulfilled the entire quarter's mining task by 2.263% and the tunneling task by 109%.

    国营龙烟铁矿超额完成第一季度生产计划
    【新华社保定六日电】国营龙烟铁矿超额百分之二点二六三完成了今年第一季度的生产计划。该矿今年的生产任务，较一九五二年提高了百分之六十六。今年第一季度生产任务能够超额完成，主要是该矿中共党委会在全体职工中深入开展了学习黄继光事迹的运动。该矿各个单位通过学习讨论会、报告会，大大鼓舞了广大职工的生产积极性。东采矿部钎子小组的工人学习黄继光英雄事迹以后，全组工人开动脑筋找窍门，首先把炉子改成了斗形，使炉子不易跑煤，火力集中，一年可给国家节省七十二吨煤；过去个人单干，整天忙乱，质量还没有保证，现在改为流水作业，各负专责，不仅保证了质量，生产效率还提高了百分之八十。机电分厂的职工提出了“学习黄继光，废品消灭光”的口号，使铸矿车轮废品由过去的百分之三十降到现在的百分之三。采矿部赵双月小组开动脑筋，改变了打眼操作，提高了产量，创造了全矿每工效率十点五三吨的最高纪录。三月份，该组以十九天超额完成了全月采矿任务的百分之一百零一。东采矿部二十一天超额完成了三月份全月的生产计划。截至三月底，龙烟铁矿除了弥补一月份亏空的生产任务外，还超额完成了全季采矿任务的百分之二点二六三，掘进任务的百分之一百零九。
