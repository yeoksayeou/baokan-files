Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 9th. The completion of state production plans by major state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region has seen significant improvement in March. Among the 49 major factories and mines in the Southwest, 28 fully completed their production plans in March, nine basically completed them (meaning the main products met their planned targets), and twelve did not complete them. Of the 39 major products, 32, including steel ingots, steelmaking, and pig iron, met their plans, while seven, including steel rails, did not. In contrast, most factories and mines failed to meet their plans in January and February. The quality of products has also improved significantly in most factories and mines.

The main reasons why most major factories and mines in the Southwest region were able to better complete their state production plans in March are that they seriously learned from the lessons of failing to meet plans in January and February, strengthened timely inspection and supervision of production plan completion, began to value planning work, and initially recognized the serious significance of completing state plans. The Southwest Financial and Economic Committee seriously inspected the completion of plans by major factories and mines on February 26th and March 5th, emphasizing the importance of planning work and striving to complete the March plans. Many factories and mines seriously examined the reasons for poor plan completion in January and February and mobilized workers to discuss the March plan. For example, Steel Plant 102 created charts of planned output and completion status, which were publicized in the teams. Workshops, teams, and individuals all established production plans and revised their patriotic pacts. Leaders at all levels also regularly inspected and supervised, thus exceeding the planned targets for major products in the first quarter. Secondly, some major factories and mines in the Southwest paid attention to combining plan completion with production reform, criticizing the erroneous view of opposing the two. Many factory and mine leaders delved deeply into production, solved key problems, and improved production management. From solving key problems, they increased output and quality.

However, some factories and mines in the Southwest still did not attach importance to planning work, and their plan completion was poor not only in January and February but also in March. Some factories and mines completed the plan in March, but the completion rate was too poor in January and February, so the first quarter plan was not completed. Also, some factories and mines completed both the March and first quarter plans, but the completion was achieved with great difficulty, the plans had not been fully discussed by the masses, production was unbalanced, and safe production was not fully achieved. To change these situations, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee recently specifically instructed all factories and mines to quickly prepare the April work plan. Leaders at all levels must personally participate in and lead the plan formulation work and fully mobilize the masses to discuss it. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also recently clearly instructed all factories and mines in Chongqing to continue production reform, strengthen planning management, and complete state plans on schedule, requiring major factories and mines to complete plans on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, and pointed out that planning management is the center of production reform in the coming period.

### 西南主要国营厂矿三月份大部完成计划

    西南主要国营厂矿三月份大部完成计划
    【新华社重庆九日电】西南区各主要国营和地方国营厂矿三月份完成国家生产计划的情况已有较显著的改进。在西南四十九个主要厂矿中，三月份全部完成生产计划的有二十八个，基本完成（即主要产品完成计划）的有九个，没有完成的十二个。从三十九种主要产品来看，有钢锭、炼钢、生铁等三十二种完成计划，有钢轨等七种没有完成。而一、二月份的情况则是大多数厂矿没有完成计划。多数厂矿在产品质量方面都有比较显著的进步。
    西南区大部分主要厂矿在三月份能够比较好地完成国家生产计划，主要原因是认真接受了一、二月份没有完成计划的教训，加强了对生产计划完成情况的及时检查督促，开始重视了计划工作，初步地认识了完成国家计划的严肃意义。西南财政经济委员会在二月二十六日和三月五日曾严肃地检查了各主要厂矿完成计划的情况，强调指出要重视计划工作，争取三月份完成计划。许多厂矿都认真地检查了一、二月份完成计划不好的原因，发动职工讨论三月份计划。如一零二钢铁厂把计划产量和完成情况制成图表，在小组中公布。车间、小组及个人都订立了生产计划和修订了爱国公约。各级领导并定期加以检查督促，因此超额完成了第一季度的主要产品计划。其次，西南一些主要厂矿注意把完成计划和生产改革结合起来，批判了把两者对立起来的错误看法。不少厂矿领导深入钻研生产，解决关键问题，改进生产管理工作。从解决关键问题中，提高了产量和质量。
    西南也有部分厂矿还很不重视计划工作，不仅一、二月份完成计划差，三月份也不好。有的厂矿虽然三月份完成了，但一、二月份完成太差，因此第一季度计划没有完成。也有部分厂矿虽然三月份和第一季度的计划都完成了，但是完成得很勉强，计划还没有经过群众充分讨论，生产不均衡，安全生产也没有完全作到。为了改变这些情况，西南财政经济委员会最近特别指示各厂矿要迅速编好四月份作业计划，各级领导必须亲自参加和领导计划的编制工作，并要充分发动群众讨论。中共重庆市委最近也明确指示重庆各厂矿必须继续生产改革，加强计划管理，按期完成国家计划，要求主要厂矿要按日、按周、按月地完成计划，并指出计划管理是今后一段时期内生产改革的中心。
