    Construction Units and Contracting Units Must Cooperate Closely
    Currently, most of our construction projects are carried out using the contracting method. In order to successfully complete the construction tasks, both parties, A and B, need to unite and cooperate, working towards the common goal of completing national construction tasks, ensuring project quality, accelerating project progress, and effectively implementing economic accounting systems. Otherwise, it will cause significant losses to the national construction projects. Last year, the relationship between parties A and B was not good in many construction projects, which greatly affected the completion of project tasks; and this year, in some units, the phenomenon of disunity between parties A and B continues to exist, hindering the smooth progress of construction preparation work.
    The root cause of the poor relationship between parties A and B lies in problems with leadership ideology. The leading cadres of these units do not proceed from the overall situation, viewing national construction projects as tasks that require joint efforts from both parties; instead, they one-sidedly emphasize the interests of their own units. They think they are "doing projects for Party A," and "as long as you have everything ready, it's fine if you can deliver by the end of the year." Or they seize on Party A's shortcomings to cover up their own mistakes. Party A, on the other hand, believes that "once the project is contracted out, it's Party B's business, and we just wait for acceptance." Or they focus solely on the shortcomings in the construction process without helping Party B to overcome them. These thoughts and practices are all wrong and detrimental to national construction. Leading cadres of construction units and construction units who have these erroneous ideas must undergo ideological criticism and establish the idea of jointly taking responsibility for the country.
    To make parties A and B cooperate in unity, it is not enough for leading cadres to have a correct understanding. Education should also be carried out among the vast number of employees, especially grasping specific examples, criticizing various erroneous views and practices, and constantly struggling against adverse phenomena that affect work. Only in this way can unity and cooperation have a mass base, and the contracting regulations can be well implemented. In addition, there should be certain systems to ensure it. For example, the form of joint meetings between parties A and B adopted by the Northeast No. 101 Factory is a method worth promoting. Through this kind of meeting, problems can be reflected in a timely manner, and solutions can be negotiated with each other, thereby continuously improving work.

    建设单位与承包单位必须密切合作
    目前我们的建筑工程，大都采用包工的方式施工。为了顺利完成建设任务，就需要甲乙双方团结合作，在共同完成国家建设任务的目标下进行工作，保证工程质量、加速工程进度和有效地贯彻经济核算制。否则就会给国家建设工程造成很大的损失。去年有不少建设工程的甲乙双方关系搞得不好，以致使工程任务的完成受到了很大的影响；而今年在某些单位中，甲乙双方不团结的现象仍然继续存在，阻碍着施工准备工作的顺利进行。
    甲乙双方关系搞得不好，首先是领导思想上有问题，这些单位的领导干部，不是从全局出发，把国家建设工程看成是需要甲乙双方共同努力完成的任务；而是片面地强调本单位的利益。认为是“替甲方干工程”，“只要你万事具备，年底能交工就得了”。或者抓住甲方的某些缺点来掩盖自己的错误。甲方则认为“工程包出去就是乙方的事，只等着验收就行了”。或者专找施工中的缺点而不帮助乙方克服。这些思想和作法都是错误的，对国家的建设是不利的。有这些错误思想的建设单位和施工单位的领导干部，必须进行思想批判，树立共同对国家负责的思想。
    要使得甲乙双方团结合作，单是领导干部有了正确的认识还不够，还应该向广大职工进行教育，特别是抓住具体事例，批判各种错误的看法和作法，向影响工作的不良现象作经常的斗争。只有这样，团结合作才有了群众基础，才能很好地贯彻包工条例。另外，还应有一定的制度加以保证。例如东北一○一厂所采用的甲乙双方联席会议的形式，就是值得推广的一种方法。通过这种会议，可以及时反映问题，互相协商解决，从而不断地改进工作。
