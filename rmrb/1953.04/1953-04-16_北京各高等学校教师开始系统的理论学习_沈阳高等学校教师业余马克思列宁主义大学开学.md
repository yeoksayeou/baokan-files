	Teachers in Beijing Colleges and Universities Begin Systematic Theoretical Study
	Shenyang College and University Teachers' Amateur Marxist-Leninist University Opens
	A formal and systematic political theory study for teachers in Beijing's colleges and universities officially began on April 11th. The purpose of this study is to enable college and university teachers to systematically establish a Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, thoroughly eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and focus on criticizing bourgeois thought, in order to better learn from advanced Soviet experience and successfully carry out teaching reform. The study plan stipulates that from April to July this year, Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" will be studied first. From September, over four years, courses such as the History of the Chinese Revolution, "Political Economy," and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" will be studied in turn. The study time for each course is scheduled for one year.
	On April 11th, Ai Siqi gave the first report on studying "On Practice" to teachers in Beijing's colleges and universities. Huang Songling, Deputy Minister of the Central Higher Education Department, attended and spoke at the beginning of the report meeting. He pointed out that in the next few years, continuing to implement teaching reform in a planned and step-by-step manner is the central task of colleges and universities. The basic method for carrying out teaching reform is to combine theory with practice and to combine learning from advanced Soviet experience with China's actual conditions. To complete the task of teaching reform, we must first rely on the continuous improvement of teachers' theoretical and professional levels; for this reason, teachers should tirelessly study Marxism-Leninism and apply the results of their studies to teaching in order to improve professional standards and teaching quality. However, studying Marxism-Leninism is a long-term task, and its spirit and essence can only be grasped through careful study. Therefore, one should not be too hasty in demanding results from the study.
	A total of 6,000 teachers and administrative staff from Beijing's colleges and universities are participating in this study. Since the beginning of last semester, they have successively studied the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. In the process of studying, their demand for studying political theory has greatly increased, and they have begun to realize the importance of studying political theory for future ideological transformation and teaching reform. At present, teachers in Beijing's colleges and universities are studying with great enthusiasm.
	The Shenyang College and University Teachers' Amateur Marxist-Leninist University held its opening ceremony on April 1st at the Shenyang Workers' Club. The school is led by the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, serving as the president, and Que Senhua, president of the China Medical University, serving as the vice president. Under the leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shenyang's colleges and universities have jointly established a study committee to specifically lead the school's study work.
	More than 2,400 teachers and staff from eleven colleges and universities and eleven secondary technical schools in Shenyang are participating in the amateur university study, including 23 principals, 106 professors, and 173 associate professors.
	The school decided to study "Dialectical Materialism" from April 1st to the end of November. Except for July and August when learning is suspended for summer vacation, the total study time is 26 weeks, with six hours per week. The entire course is divided into ten lectures, with lectures given once every other week. The study method is based on self-study, combined with lectures and pre- and post-class tutoring activities to conduct in-depth discussions. At the same time, it is stipulated that students must write learning papers or study notes and learning experiences after studying to a certain stage.

    北京各高等学校教师开始系统的理论学习
    沈阳高等学校教师业余马克思列宁主义大学开学
    北京各高等学校教师正规的、系统的政治理论学习已于四月十一日正式开始。这次学习的目的，是为了使高等学校教师有系统地建立马克思列宁主义的观点，彻底肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想，并着重批判资产阶级思想，以便更好地学习苏联先进经验，胜利地进行教学改革。学习计划规定：自今年四月到七月，先学习毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”。从九月起，在四年内依次学习中国革命史、“政治经济学”和“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”等课程。每门课程的学习时间预定为一年。
    四月十一日，艾思奇已向北京各高等学校教师作了关于学习“实践论”的第一次报告。报告会开始时，中央高等教育部黄松龄副部长出席讲话。他指出：在今后几年中，有计划、有步骤地继续贯彻教学改革，是高等学校的中心任务。进行教学改革的基本方法是理论和实践相结合，学习苏联先进经验和中国实际情况相结合。要完成教学改革的任务，首先要依靠教师理论水平和业务水平的不断提高；为此，教师们应该不倦地学习马克思列宁主义，并把学习成果运用到教学中去，以提高业务水平和教学质量。但学习马克思列宁主义是长期的任务，必须经过认真的学习，才能掌握它的精神和实质。因此对学习不能要求过急。
    北京各高等学校教师和行政工作人员参加这次学习的共六千人。从上学期以来，他们先后学习了苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件，斯大林同志的“苏联社会主义经济问题”和悼念斯大林同志的文件。在学习过程中，他们对学习政治理论的要求大大提高，并开始体会到政治理论学习对于今后思想改造和教学改革的重要性。目前，北京各高等学校的教师，正以很大的热情进行学习。
    沈阳高等学校教师业余马克思列宁主义大学已于四月一日在沈阳工人俱乐部举行了开学典礼。该校由中共沈阳市委领导，中共沈阳市委书记黄欧东任校长，中国医科大学校长阙森华任副校长。沈阳各高等学校在中共沈阳市委的领导下，已联合成立学习委员会来具体领导该校的学习工作。
    参加业余大学学习的包括沈阳十一个高等学校和十一个中等技术学校的教师、职员共两千四百余人，其中有校长二十三人、教授一百零六人、副教授一百七十三人。
    该校决定从四月一日起至十一月底止，学习“辩证唯物论”，其间除七、八两月因放暑假停止学习外，全部学习时间共为二十六周，每周为六小时。全部课程分做十次讲完，每隔一周讲课一次。学习方法系以自学为主，并结合讲课和课前课后的辅导活动，进行深入讨论。同时规定，学习到一定阶段，学员须写出学习论文或学习笔记和学习心得。
