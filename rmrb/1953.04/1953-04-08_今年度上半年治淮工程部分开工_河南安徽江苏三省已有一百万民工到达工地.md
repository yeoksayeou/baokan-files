Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 7th: With the weather warming in the Huai River basin, the first half of the 1953 Huai River project has partially commenced. One million Huai River laborers from Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have arrived at the construction sites. Thousands of vehicles and boats on the Huai River line are rushing to transport food and fuel for the laborers.

The main projects for the first half of 1953 in the Huai River governance include: Henan Province continuing the construction of the Nanwan Reservoir and the Boshan Reservoir, consolidating the Hong River, Ying River, Bao River, Huiji River, and Hei River and other Huai River tributaries, and installing the gates of the Baisha Reservoir, Banqiao Reservoir, and Shimantan Reservoir. Anhui Province continues to build the Fozi Ridge Reservoir, repairs the main stream of the Huai River below Wuhe County and the tributary diversion projects, builds the Chengdong Lake water inlet gate, the Wangjiaba water inlet gate, and the Runheji ship lock, and consolidates the Sui River, Quan River, and Bei Fei River and other Huai River tributaries. Northern Jiangsu continues to build the Sanhe Sluice, builds the Shaobo Control Sluice, the Huaian Control Sluice, the Liudu South Sluice, the Liudu North Sluice, and the Gaoliangjian Ship Lock, the Taizhou Xiannvmiao Ship Lock, and the Huaian Ship Lock.

The main goal of the 1953 Huai River governance project is to vigorously eliminate waterlogging disasters in the low-lying areas of the Huai River and to continue to control floods. The consolidation of the drainage systems of the Hong River, Ying River, Bao River, and Hei River in Henan Province, and the Quan River and Bei Fei River in Anhui Province, are projects being built to eliminate waterlogging disasters from point to line to surface. These projects are of a very large scale. The Hong River consolidation project in Henan Province involves approximately 18 million cubic meters of earthwork. More than 300,000 laborers from more than ten counties in the Xinyang Special District are participating in this project. The Quan River consolidation project in Anhui involves more than 15 million cubic meters of earthwork, with the participation of 150,000 laborers. After the completion of these waterlogging elimination projects, farmers in the low-lying areas of the Huai River basin will be able to develop production with peace of mind. This year, the Huai River Management Committee has selected key areas along the Fei River in Anhui Province to conduct crop conversion experiments. In the past, this area was planted with coarse grains. This year, experiments will be conducted to change to rice cultivation, so that the internal water can be converted for irrigating farmland.

In the 1953 Huai River governance project, the Fozi Ridge Reservoir in Anhui Province, the diversion project of the main and tributary streams of the Huai River below Wuhe County, the Nanwan Reservoir and Boshan Reservoir in Henan Province, and the Sanhe Sluice in northern Jiangsu are still key projects. These projects did not stop construction last winter. The Fozi Ridge Reservoir project in Anhui Province is vast and will not be fully completed until 1954. The Sanhe Sluice will be completed before this year's summer flood season. After the completion of this huge sluice, the floodwaters of Hongze Lake can be effectively controlled, reducing the threat of Huai River floods to northern Jiangsu and benefiting the irrigation of farmland in northern Jiangsu.

    今年度上半年治淮工程部分开工
    河南安徽江苏三省已有一百万民工到达工地
    【新华社蚌埠七日电】淮河流域日暖风和，一九五三年度治淮工程的上半年工程，部分已经开始施工。河南、安徽、江苏三省已有一百万治淮民工到达工地。淮河线上成千上万的车辆、船只，正在为民工们赶运食粮和燃料。
    一九五三年度上半年的治淮工程，主要包括：河南省继续修建南湾水库、薄山水库，整理洪河、颍河、包河、惠济河、黑河等淮河支流，装置白沙水库、板桥水库和石漫滩水库的闸门。安徽省继续修建佛子岭水库，整修五河县以下的淮河干流和支流分流工程，建造城东湖进水闸、王家坝进水闸和润河集船闸，整理濉河、泉河、北淝河等淮河支流。苏北继续修建三河闸，建造邵伯节制闸、淮安节制闸六垛南闸、六垛北闸，和高良涧船闸、泰州仙女庙船闸、淮安船闸等工程。
    一九五三年度治淮工程，主要是要大力排除淮河低洼地区的内涝灾害，并继续控制洪水。河南省洪河、颍河、包河、黑河和安徽省泉河、北淝河等排水系统的整理，就是从点到线到面的排除内涝灾害而兴修的工程。这些工程的规模都非常巨大，河南省洪河整理工程，约有一千八百万公方。参加这一工程的有信阳专区十多个县的民工，共有三十多万人。安徽泉河整理工程约有一千五百多万公方的土方，参加的民工达十五万人。这些排除内涝灾害的工程完成后，淮河流域低洼地带的农民，将能安心发展生产。今年治淮委员会已在安徽省淝河沿岸选择重点地区作改种农作物的试验。这个地区过去都种植杂粮，今年将试验改种水稻，使内水能转用来灌溉农田。
    一九五三年度治淮工程中，安徽省的佛子岭水库，五河县以下的淮河干、支流分流工程，河南省的南湾水库、薄山水库，苏北的三河闸，仍然是重点工程，这些工程，去年冬天都没有停工。安徽省的佛子岭水库工程浩大，要到一九五四年才能全部修成。三河闸就要在今年夏汛以前修成，这个巨大的水闸修成后，洪泽湖的洪水从此可以有效控制，减轻淮河洪水对苏北地区的威胁，并有利于苏北地区农田的灌溉。
