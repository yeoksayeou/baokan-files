    Central Forestry Ministry Notifies All Forest Regions to Focus on Fire Prevention in Coordination with Spring Planting
    A letter from the Fire Prevention Office of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government: We believe the suggestion made by reader Yang Shu in the "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on April 3rd regarding "People's Governments in all mountain and forest areas should focus on fire prevention in coordination with spring planting" is completely correct. Forestry fire prevention work in various forest areas, especially in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, is being carried out simultaneously with spring planting. To ensure that spring planting and fire prevention do not interfere with each other, we have, based on Comrade Yang Shu's suggestion, sent separate letters to the People's Governments of provinces and counties in various forest regions, urging them to closely integrate fire prevention with spring planting and to do a good job in forestry fire prevention work in coordination with spring planting.

    中央林业部已通知各林区围绕春耕生产做好防火工作
    中央人民政府林业部护林防火办公室来信：四月三日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者杨枢关于“各山林地区人民政府应围绕春耕生产做好防火工作”的建议，我们认为是完全正确的。各地林区，尤其东北、内蒙各林区的护林防火工作正与春耕生产同时进行。为使春耕、防火两不误，我们根据杨枢同志的建议，已分函各林区省县人民政府把防火与春耕密切结合起来，围绕着春耕生产把护林防火工作做好。
