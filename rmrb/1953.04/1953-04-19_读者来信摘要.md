Reader's Letters Abstract

Incident of People Being Trampled to Death and Injured While Watching a Movie in Xichuan County, Henan Province

Jin Yingwu from the Culture and Education Section of the Xichuan County People's Government in Henan Province writes: I am telling you about the unfortunate incident of people being trampled to death while watching a movie in Xichuan County, Henan Province. On the evening of March 30th, the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' film projection team was showing a movie at the Xichuan County Teachers' School. Before the showing, many people crowded at the gate trying to get in. Because there was no good planning for how to check tickets in advance, more and more people gathered, making it impossible to check tickets. After the gate opened, many people were pushed down, resulting in three deaths and four or five serious injuries. Those trampled to death were a 37-year-old woman, an 11-year-old girl, and a two or three-year-old child. After the incident, Comrade Qi Ziyu, Deputy County Head of Xichuan County, made a self-criticism at a mass meeting regarding the bureaucracy of the county government: there was no good organization of the masses to watch the film in an orderly manner in advance. He also mentioned being responsible for treating the seriously injured and offering condolences and care to the families of the deceased.

On March 31st, the Xichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also convened a meeting specifically to examine the cause of the incident. The investigation revealed that the main reason was that the Xichuan County Federation of Trade Unions had not researched how to organize the masses to watch the film in an orderly manner in advance. Although two preparatory meetings were held, they discussed other matters. The occurrence of this unfortunate incident is also related to our county's public security forces. The first time the film was shown, although people were also very crowded, because our county's public security forces arrived early and maintained order, no accidents occurred. On the evening of the 30th, when the public security forces arrived, people were already being trampled. They did not fulfill their due responsibilities.

Finally, I believe that the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' film projection team also made a big mistake. It is said that they had also had people trampled to death in other places when showing movies, but after arriving in Xichuan, they did not contact the various departments to conduct detailed research on the issue of organizing the masses to watch the film. Moreover, the first time the film was shown, people were very crowded, but they did not offer any suggestions or learn from past lessons. This is a big mistake. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening, I believe that all regions should pay attention to the issue of organizing the masses to watch films. (We also received a letter from the Third Class Communications Group of the First Junior High School of Xichuan County, Henan Province, with the same content – Editor)

Opinions on Improving Current Literary and Art Work
——Summary of Readers' Letters

After this newspaper published some writers' opinions on the current problems of literary and artistic creation in late February, it received many letters from readers and writers. They all expressed dissatisfaction with the current backwardness of literary and artistic creation and urgently demanded that it be improved quickly, and put forward some positive suggestions.

The following is a summary of some of the letters:

Writer Shu Wu wrote in his letter: There is a practical problem that is quite common: that is, many people who can engage in creation today are placed in other work positions. Literary and artistic labor, like all labor, requires proficiency, requires delving into it, requires long-term systematic learning and operation, and is not a matter of "doing it as an aside." But now some leading comrades in some places have the idea of ​​underestimating professional literary and artistic creation and research work. This is a problem worth noting.

Li Zhong's letter from the Northeast Literature and Art Publishing House reflected the dissatisfaction of the people in Northeast China with the lack of songs and entertainment materials. He said that today we can no longer just say that writers are unwilling to delve into life. He believes that today's more important issue for the literary and art circles is how the leadership can provide some cadres who may create with convenient conditions so that they can get the opportunity to delve into life, and then regularly guide them on how to correctly delve into life and actively engage in creation. It is necessary to give writers a longer time to engage in some creations with higher ideological and artistic qualities, but at the same time, he believes that on the one hand, we must oppose the incorrect understanding of how literature and art should be combined with political tasks, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to preventing writers from using various excuses to detach themselves from reality. For example: there are currently few literary and artistic works reflecting basic construction, especially short, popular literary and artistic works, which is a problem worth noting. He said that it is reasonable and necessary for writers to supply their lives with the rewards of their labor.

Zhang Min from Harbin Foreign Language Institute and Shen Yanqun from Hebei Water Conservancy and Civil Engineering School both mentioned in their letters that in addition to leading writers to work hard to delve into life and engage in creation, literary and art leading organs in various places must also pay attention to the training of some young people who love writing. In factories, rural areas, and schools, there are quite a few young people who can write. Cultural leading organs, literary and art groups, and editorial departments of literary and art publications should give them due attention. Their works, in the current view, are immature and crude, but they are promising. With continuous care, training, and their own efforts, they can gradually become a new force in literary and artistic creation.

Qiu Yin, a reader from Changsha, Hunan, wrote: "The people not only ask newspapers and periodicals to publish more short articles, but also ask for more and better literary and artistic works. He said: The issue of the provincial party committee's leadership over literary and artistic work raised by Comrade Tian Bing in the article "A Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Lessons in Failure in Leading Creation Work" is a problem that has not been resolved in many places. Literary and artistic work in various places does not seem to have reached the level of importance that the central government attaches to it. Many cadres in charge of literary and artistic work do not seem to feel the seriousness of the backward situation in literary and artistic creation. They do not pay attention to the leadership of literary and artistic work and are still obsessed with administrative affairs.

Zhang Peijiu, a worker from Boshan, Shandong, suggested that the leading organs of literary and artistic work should adopt appropriate organizational forms and maintain contact with active workers in literary and artistic work in factories and mines. This can help both writers and workers. There are many active literary and artistic workers and people who can write literary and artistic works among workers in factories and mines. He asked for attention to be paid to the creative forces among workers and help them improve.

Guo Huimin from a study group of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Wang Zhe from the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Xu Feng, a reader from Lufeng, Guangdong, Tang Tu, a reader from Dalian, Yang Jian, a reader from Nanjing, Liu Nianqu from the China Film Management Company, Shi Wenqi from Beijing Correspondence Normal School, and Ling Zupei from the Anhui Provincial Art Troupe, etc., believe that writers' lifestyles should be changed, and writers' labor should be respected, while also emphasizing the necessity of writers strengthening their studies and delving into life. Comrade Wang Zhe said: "If writers do not have the most advanced socialist ideology, they cannot truly understand the laws of real life, they cannot get close to and understand the ideological feelings of the masses, and they cannot truly become 'engineers of the human soul'."

Some readers also believe that royalties and performance taxes are systems specifically designed by capitalist countries to protect the private rights and interests of writers, and this system should not be allowed to exist in our new country and new society." Some readers believe that mentioning royalties and performance taxes is a "bourgeois viewpoint," etc. These opinions are obviously incorrect. Manuscript fees, royalties, performance taxes, etc., are all due compensation for writers' labor, and these legitimate rights and interests should be protected.

Certain Units Purchasing and Selling Goods in Taiyuan City
Should Check Their Violations of Financial and Economic Policies

The Shanxi Daily forwarded a letter from Chen Feng of the Taiyuan Municipal Finance and Economics Committee: Some local state-owned enterprises and cooperatives from other places have violated financial and economic policies when purchasing and selling goods in Taiyuan, causing serious losses to state property. For example, in August 1952, purchasing personnel from three units, including the Shijiazhuang Yumin Chemical Factory and the Tianjin Enterprise Company, successively signed contracts with the Taiyuan second-hand dealer Qiao Xiying to purchase 180,000 jin of animal bones and prepaid a deposit of approximately 40 million yuan. However, Qiao Xiying used the money to do business and only delivered more than 100,000 jin of broken bones by the end of last year, and the remaining more than 15 million yuan has not yet been returned. Between last autumn and winter, the Shijiazhuang Yumin Chemical Factory and the Qingdao Chemical Factory again gave tens of millions of yuan to private merchant Zhao Tongxiang to collect animal bones on their behalf, without even signing a contract. As a result, by the end of last year, the private merchant had not delivered any bones, and the money was挪用 (embezzled) for several months in vain. The above-mentioned units competing to purchase animal bones in Taiyuan also affected the rise in bone prices in Taiyuan. The price of bones rose from 150 yuan per jin in September last year to 360 yuan, and it was still difficult to buy goods. In addition, from October to November last year, three units, the Dingxiang Iron Factory, the Dingxiang Production Cooperative, and the Bo'ai County Cooperative, entrusted four private merchants in Taiyuan, Yihhechang, Gonghecheng, Xiangyunhou, and the Bamboo Industry Joint Company, to sell goods on their behalf, and deposited public funds in these private merchants, with deposits amounting to more than 1 billion yuan; the private merchants used these public funds to do business. The above-mentioned violations of financial and economic policies cannot be allowed. The Taiyuan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has recovered the arrears and illegal profits from illegal private merchants in this city to compensate for state losses; the above-mentioned local state-owned enterprises and cooperatives should also educate and deal with relevant derelict personnel and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    河南淅川县群众看电影时
    发生踩死踩伤人的事件
    河南省淅川县人民政府文教科金英武来信：我把河南省淅川县为看电影踩死人的不幸事件告诉你们。三月三十日晚上，河南省总工会电影放映队在淅川县县立师范学校放映电影。放映前，很多群众都挤在大门口想进去看，因为事先没有很好研究如何验票，人愈来愈多，没法验票，门开后，许多人被挤倒了，以致踩死三人，重伤四、五人。踩死的
    一个是三十七岁的妇女，一个是十一岁的小女孩，
    一个是两、三岁的小孩。事情发生后，即由淅川县副县长戚子玉同志在群众大会上检讨县政府的官僚主义：事先没有很好地组织群众有秩序地看影片。并谈到负责给重伤者治疗，对死者家属予以慰问和照顾。
    三月三十一日，中共淅川县委员会又专为此事召开会议，检查事情发生的原因。检查结果，主要原因是事先淅川县总工会没有对如何组织群众有秩序地看影片进行研究，虽然也开了两次筹备会，但讨论的是别的事情。这件不幸事情的发生，与我县的公安部队也有关系。第一次放映影片时，人虽然也很挤，但因我县公安部队到场早，维持了秩序，没有发生什么事故。三十日晚上公安部队到场时，人已挤死了。他们没有尽到应尽的责任。
    最后，我认为河南省总工会电影放映队也有很大错误。据说他们在别处放映影片时，也曾发生过踩死人的事，但他们到淅川后也没有和各机关取得联系，详细研究组织群众看影片的问题。而且第一次放映影片时人就非常挤，他们也不提出意见，接受过去的教训，这是很大的错误。为了防止类似事件的发生，我认为各地都应注意组织群众观看影片的问题。（我们同时收到河南省淅川县第一初级中学三上班通讯小组的来信，内容和这相同——编者）
    对改进当前文艺工作的意见
        ——读者来信综述
    本报二月下旬发表了一些作家对当前文艺创作问题的意见后，接到不少读者和作家的来信。他们都表示对当前文艺创作落后现象的不满，迫切地要求迅速予以改进，并提出一些积极性的建议。
    下面是一部分来信的摘要：
    作家舒芜来信说：有一个实际问题，相当普遍地存在着：就是今天不少能搞创作的人，被放在其他工作岗位上。文艺劳动，本来和一切劳动一样，需要熟练，需要钻进去，需要长时期有系统地学习和操作，而不是“附带搞一搞”的事情。但现在有些地方的领导同志，有轻视专业的文艺创作和研究工作的思想。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    东北文艺出版社李中的来信，反映了东北地区人民群众对歌曲和文娱材料缺乏的不满。他说今天再不能光说作家不愿意深入生活。他认为今天文艺界更重要的问题是领导上如何给一些可能创作的干部以便利条件，使他们能获得深入生活的机会，并进而经常地指导他们如何正确地深入生活和积极地进行创作。给作家以较长的时间从事一些思想性、艺术性较高的创作，是必要的，但他同时认为一方面要反对不正确地理解文艺如何与政治任务结合，一方面也必须注意防止作家以各种藉口脱离实际的倾向。譬如：目前很少反映基本建设的文艺作品，特别是短小、通俗的文艺作品，就是值得注意的问题。他说作家应以自己劳动的报酬来供给自己的生活，这是合理的，必要的。
    哈尔滨外国语专科学校张敏、河北水利土木学校沈雁群来信中都说到各地文艺领导机关除了应领导作家努力深入生活、进行创作以外，还必须注意对
    一些爱好写作的青年的培养。在工厂、农村和学校中，能够写作的青年是不少的。文化领导机关、文艺团体和文艺刊物的编辑部，对他们应该给以应有的注意。他们的作品，在目前看来，是幼稚的，粗糙的，但是他们是有前途的，在不断的关心和培养和他们本身的努力下，可以逐渐成为文艺创作的新生力量。
    湖南长沙读者蚯蚓来信说：“人民群众不仅要求各报刊多发表短文，同时也要求更多更好的文艺作品。他说：田兵同志在“一个省文联在领导创作工作上的失败教训”一文中所提出的省委对文艺工作的领导问题，是在好多地方都没有解决的问题。文艺工作在各地似乎并没有达到像中央那样重视的程度。很多负责文艺工作的干部，好像没有感觉到文艺创作的落后情况的严重性。他们不重视对文艺工作的领导，仍然醉心于行政事务。
    山东博山工人张佩玖来信建议文艺工作领导机关采取适当的组织形式，和厂矿的工人文艺工作积极分子保持联系，这样可以对作家和工人都有帮助。在厂矿工人中有不少的文艺积极分子，也有能写文艺作品的人。他要求重视工人中的创作力量，帮助他们提高。
    解放军某部学习团郭惠民、青年团天津市委宣传部王哲、广东陆丰读者徐风、大连市读者唐突、南京市读者杨健、中国影片经理公司刘念渠、北京函授师范学校施文淇、安徽省文工团凌祖培等来信，认为作家的生活方式应该改变，对作家的劳动也应该尊重，同时也应该强调作家们加强学习和深入生活的必要。王哲同志说：“作家如果没有最先进的社会主义思想，就不能真正了解现实生活的规律，就不能贴近和体会群众的思想感情，也就不可能真正成为“人类灵魂的工程师”。
    也有些读者认为版税、上演税都是资本主义国家为维护作家的私有权益而特定的制度，这个制度是不应允许在我们的新国家新社会中存在的。”有些读者认为提到版税、上演税，就是“资产阶级观点”等。这些意见显然是不对的。稿费、版税、上演税等，都是作家劳动应有的代价，这种合法的权益应该受到保护。到太原市购销货物的某些单位
    应检查违犯财经政策的行为
    山西日报转来太原市财经委员会陈丰来信：有些外地的地方国营企业和合作社到太原市购销货物时有违犯财经政策的行为，使国家财产受到严重损失。如一九五二年八月间，石家庄裕民化学厂和天津企业公司等三个单位的采购人员先后到太原市和旧货商乔栖英签订了收购兽骨十八万斤的合同，预付定金约四千万元。而乔栖英把这些钱拿去做买卖，到去年年底才交了十万多斤碎骨头，其余一千五百多万元至今还未交回。去年秋冬之间，石家庄裕民化学厂和青岛化工厂又把几千万元钱交给私商赵同祥代收兽骨，连合同都未签订。结果到去年年底，私商一点骨头都没交，钱被白白挪用了几个月。上述单位在太原争购兽骨，还影响了太原市骨价上涨，去年九月骨头价格每斤由一百五十元涨到三百六十元，还买不到货。此外，去年十月到十一月间，定襄铁工厂、定襄生产合作社、博爱县合作社三个单位委托太原市义合长、公合成、祥云厚、竹业联营公司四户私商代销商品，就把公款存在这些私商处，存款多达十余亿元；私商就把这些公款拿去做买卖。以上违犯财经政策的行为是不能允许的。太原市工商行政管理局已向本市违法私商追回欠款和非法利润，以补偿国家损失；上述地方国营企业和合作社也应对有关失职人员进行教育和处理，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
