    Northeast Administrative Committee Issues Instructions on Actively Organizing Spring Plowing
    The Northeast Administrative Committee issued instructions on actively organizing spring plowing. The instructions pointed out: With the Qingming Festival approaching, various regions have already begun plowing and sowing wheat. The overriding central task in rural areas at present is to quickly mobilize and organize the vast number of farmers to promptly engage in spring plowing and sowing. All other work or work arrangements of various departments and the allocation of cadre forces must revolve around this central task. To this end, the instructions require that all localities change work methods that involve evenly distributed forces, division of labor without combination and cooperation, and that certain unnecessary or postponable meetings be stopped or postponed in order to concentrate efforts on organizing spring plowing work. At the same time, it is necessary to universally and thoroughly carry out propaganda and education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and increasing production for patriotism, and repeatedly explain comprehensive production policies to cadres and farmers in order to enhance and leverage the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers and launch a patriotic production increase movement. The instructions also require all localities to strengthen in-depth and specific leadership and earnestly do the following major tasks during spring plowing: (1) Consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperation organizations; (2) Promote the high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan in Heilongjiang Province, improve farming techniques, and unleash the potential of agricultural production; (3) Strengthen the mobilization and organization of drought prevention and resistance to ensure timely sowing; (4) Do a good job in promoting new-style agricultural implements; (5) Establish agricultural technology guidance stations in an organized and planned manner to strengthen technical guidance for farmers; (6) Strengthen the leadership of state-owned farms to further leverage their leading and demonstrative role in the agricultural economy.
