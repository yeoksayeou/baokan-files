Leninism—The Great Banner for the Struggle for Communism
Soviet Union  Bù·Bù'ěrkēfū

Editor's Note: Today is the eighty-third anniversary of the birth of the great Lenin. We have specially invited Comrade Bù'ěrkēfū and Comrade Jíhèmiěrnòfū from the Soviet Union to write these two articles, which are now published here.

Ulyanovsk, in the Volga River region of Russia, is a place known to everyone. Eighty-three years ago, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder of the great Communist Party and the world's first socialist country, was born here.

Lenin, a giant of revolutionary thought and revolutionary action, dedicated his life to realizing the most sublime goal—liberating workers from capitalist enslavement and creating a new social system without exploitation or exploiters.

Stalin said: "Lenin was not only the leader of the Russian proletariat, not only the leader of the European workers, not only the leader of the colonial East, but also the leader of the entire working class of the world." ("In Memory of Lenin")

Lenin's name is immortal, and the great Lenin-Stalin cause is also immortal. The name of Lenin, and the name of his great successor Stalin, has become the banner of struggle for a bright future for all mankind. The Lenin-Stalin banner flies proudly above us, bringing happiness to the world.

Lenin understood the revolutionary essence of Marxism in his youth. After mastering this theory, he turned it into an effective weapon for the struggle for revolutionary victory. Lenin was a great master of revolutionary science—a genius inheritor of the doctrines of Marx and Engels.

Leninism is a further continuation and creative development of Marxism under new conditions. Lenin's merit lies in enriching Marxism with new conclusions and principles, not being afraid to change certain individual outdated principles, and further developing Marxism to make it suitable for new historical conditions. The strength of Marxism-Leninism lies in its creativity. Its strength lies in its understanding of the objective laws of nature and society. Lenin's doctrine is invincible because it is correct, because it correctly reflects the matured demands in the development of social material life, and reflects the fundamental interests of the working people.

Lenin pointed out more than once that Marxism is not a dogma, but a guide to action, and that revolutionary theory should be pushed forward. Lenin bravely pushed it forward, illuminating the way forward for the revolutionary party. Lenin never recognized any stale formulas.

Lenin developed Marxism under new historical conditions, under the conditions of uneven political and economic development of capitalist countries, and in the era of imperialism, and thus concluded that socialist revolution could achieve victory in one country, in the weakest link in the chain of imperialism.

This new contribution to Marxism—a complete theory of socialist revolution—became the fighting weapon of the Russian proletariat in its struggle to seize power, and the fighting weapon of the entire international proletariat.

Lenin discovered that Soviet power is the best state form and form of power for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the highest form of democracy in class society. The history of the Soviet state itself proves the great vitality of this form of power.

Lenin first demonstrated the possibility of establishing a complete socialist society in a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union have confirmed the vitality of Lenin's genius foresight.

Every field of knowledge and practice related to the struggle of the revolutionary working class was enriched by Lenin and by Stalin, a faithful student of Lenin. Lenin and Stalin increased the ideological wealth of Marxism, advancing it to a new and higher stage.

Stalin taught: "Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. More precisely: Leninism is generally the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution, and particularly the theory and tactics of the dictatorship of the proletariat." ("Foundations of Leninism")

Stalin defended Leninism in a fierce struggle against various enemies of revolutionary theory and the revolutionary party, and more closely united the ranks of the Communist Party under this lofty banner. Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, constantly enriched the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and boldly pushed revolutionary science forward. The Leninist ideas developed by Stalin have grasped the broad masses of the people, and they have become an invincible force for transforming the world with communist principles. Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is the highest stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism. Stalin creatively developed Leninism, arming and mobilizing all the working people of the world to fight for the victory of communism.

In his new work, Stalin comprehensively explored the laws of social production and the distribution of material wealth in socialist society, and discovered the basic economic law of socialism and the basic economic law of modern capitalism. Stalin put forward three basic prerequisites for preparing the transition from socialism to communism.

First, Comrade Stalin taught that it is necessary to effectively guarantee the continuous growth of all social production, and that the growth of the production of the means of production should take priority.

Second, it is necessary to raise the ownership of collective farms to the level of ownership by the whole people by means of gradually transitioning in a way that is beneficial to the collective farms and therefore also beneficial to the entire society, and commodity circulation should also be replaced by product exchange.

Third, it is necessary to bring society to such a high level of cultural development as to ensure the all-round development of the intellectual and physical abilities of all members of society, so that members of society can obtain an education sufficient to become active activists in social development.

Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and his speech at the Nineteenth Party Congress formed the basis of the various historic resolutions of the Nineteenth Party Congress, and powerfully illuminated the path of struggle for all honest people in the world.

Lenin and Stalin were not only great Marxist theorists, but also the highest masters of revolutionary leadership, and the tested leaders of millions of working masses and fighters for liberating all peoples from oppression and exploitation.

Lenin and Stalin created and trained a new type of party—the powerful Communist Party, which is the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era. The Communist Party, armed with lofty ideals, led the working people of Russia to carry out and win the October Socialist Revolution, led the Soviet people to fight and win against domestic and foreign enemies during the Civil War, mobilized the Soviet working people to restore the devastated economy and realize Stalin's many construction plans and achieved victory, and launched the Soviet people against the fascist aggressors in the Great Patriotic War and won a victory of worldwide historical significance. The entire struggle of the Party to unite the broad masses of the people for the common goal of socialism is Marxism in action.

Lenin and Stalin believed that the unique role of the Communist Party lies in the fact that it is the leader and organizer of all the victories of socialism in the Soviet Union. The great world transformers scientifically demonstrated the significance of the Party, and determined its leading position in the socialist state system and in the entire struggle to build a communist society. Lenin and Stalin gave a clear program to the actions of the vanguard of the people—the Communist Party.

Lenin and Stalin often taught the Party to strengthen its ties with the people and never to be separated from the people at any time. The Communist Party is strong and powerful because of its connection with the people, and because of the people's infinite trust, love, and loyalty to it. For more than fifty years, the history of the Communist Party has clearly shown the people that the Communist Party is the consistent and reliable representative of the interests of the people, and the leader and teacher of the people. The basis of the Party's close ties with the people is the commonality of their interests and goals, and the common struggle they are engaged in under the same banner—the banner of Lenin and Stalin.

Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism, theoretically demonstrated and realized the principle that the Soviet state must be constantly consolidated. Stalin pointed out that even under communism, if capitalist encirclement still exists, if the danger of foreign military aggression has not been eliminated, the state must still be preserved.

Stalin formulated and implemented the great program of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization based on Lenin's principles. Several Stalin Five-Year Plans transformed a previously technologically and economically backward country into a powerful industrial country with highly developed collective agriculture. This power was particularly evident during the Great Patriotic War. Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of the brilliant commander Stalin, the Soviet people won a victory of worldwide historical significance in the Great Patriotic War and saved mankind from the threat of fascist enslavement.

Lenin taught: "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country." According to Lenin's instructions, the Soviet people, under the leadership of Stalin, carried out tremendous work in the electrification of the country. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulated a broad program for peaceful communist construction, including the further expansion of electricity production. All the Soviet people are victoriously realizing this program.

Lenin formulated a plan for the Party to transform agriculture on new socialist principles. According to Lenin's cooperative plan, the Party attracted the broad masses of working peasants to participate in the cause of socialist construction. The leadership of the socialist industry and the working class over the peasants determined the reality of this plan. Stalin, according to Lenin's instructions, formulated and implemented the program of agricultural collectivization. Comprehensive collectivization and the elimination of the rich peasant class on this basis made historical changes in the countryside possible, which, as Stalin pointed out, are of the same significance as the revolutionary changes of October 1917 in terms of their consequences.

Leninism is a great doctrine of internationalism. It lives in the victorious communist construction of the Soviet people, in the labor of the great friendly Chinese people building a new life, and in the achievements of the people's democratic countries, and in the liberation struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries.

The Lenin-Stalin principles on industrialization, especially on the socialist transformation of agriculture, have become the basis of the activities of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democratic countries. The victory of the Soviet collective farm system and the achievements of the cooperativization of peasants in the people's democratic countries are unquestionable victories of Leninism.

The Soviet people have begun the cause that all the people of the world will inevitably engage in sooner or later. From the cause realized by the Soviet state, the tomorrow of all mankind can be seen. Lenin said: "...all countries can see from the example of Russia certain events that they will inevitably encounter in the near future, and they are extremely important events." ("'Left-Wing' Childishness in the Communist Movement")

Lenin's prophecy has been realized. Now, hundreds of millions of people in Europe and Asia have embarked on the path of socialism, emulating the example of the Soviet people, and together with the Soviet Union, they have formed a powerful camp for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Stalin pointed out in his speech at the Nineteenth Party Congress that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has gloriously fulfilled the role of the "shock brigade" of the world revolutionary movement and the workers' movement.

Lenin taught that the strength of the Soviet state lies in the consciousness of the working masses. Lenin pointed out: "In our opinion, the state is powerful precisely because of the consciousness of the masses." The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of its leader and teacher Stalin, carried out tremendous mass communist education work. The transition from socialism to communism requires the continuous improvement of the consciousness of all the people. Leninism is the basis of all ideological work of the Communist Party and the Soviet state.

Marxist-Leninist theory enables people to determine direction in the environment, understand the internal connections of surrounding events, foresee the course of events, and distinguish the prospects for their further development.

"Marxism," as defined by Stalin, "is the science of the laws of development in nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, the science of the construction of a communist society."

The honest people of the world, armed with Marxism-Leninism, are bravely looking forward. They have seen their bright future. (Special Contribution to this Newspaper)

    列宁主义—为共产主义而斗争的伟大旗帜
    苏联  布·布尔科夫
    编者按：今天是伟大的列宁诞生八十三周年的纪念日，我们特约苏联布尔科夫同志和吉赫米尔诺夫同志写这两篇文章，现在发表在这里。
    俄国伏尔加河流域的乌里扬诺夫斯克是人人皆知的地方。八十三年前，伟大的共产党及世界上第一个社会主义国家的缔造者——乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁在这里诞生。
    革命思想和革命行动的巨人列宁把他的一生贡献给实现最崇高的目标——从资本主义奴役下解放劳动者，创立没有剥削和剥削者的新的社会制度。
    斯大林说：“列宁不仅是俄国无产阶级底领袖，不仅是欧洲工人底领袖，不仅是殖民地东方底领袖，而且是环球整个劳动界底领袖。”（“追悼列宁”）
    列宁的名字是不朽的，伟大的列宁斯大林的事业也是不朽的。列宁的名字，以及他的伟大继承者斯大林的名字，已成为全人类争取光辉未来的斗争旗帜。列宁—斯大林的旗帜高傲地飘荡在我们上空，它给世界带来幸福。
    列宁早在少年时代就已懂得马克思主义的革命实质，他掌握了这种理论之后，便把它变成争取革命胜利的有效斗争武器。列宁是伟大的革命科学巨匠—马克思与恩格斯学说的天才继承者。
    列宁主义是马克思主义在新时代条件下进一步的继续和创造的发展。列宁的功勋就在于他以新的结论和原理丰富了马克思主义，不怕改变某些个别的陈旧的原理，进一步发展了马克思主义，使它适合于新的历史条件。马克思列宁主义的力量，就在于它的创造性。它的力量，正在于它依据着对自然界和社会客观法则的认识。列宁的学说是不可战胜的，因为它是正确的，因为它正确地反映着社会物质生活发展中已成熟的要求，反映着劳动者的根本利益。
    列宁曾不只一次地指出，马克思主义，它不是教条，而是行动的指南，应该把革命理论推向前进。列宁就曾勇敢地把它推向前进，为革命政党照亮了前进的道路。列宁从不承认任何陈腐的公式。
    列宁在新的历史条件下，在资本主义各国政治经济发展不平衡的条件下，在帝国主义时代，发展了马克思主义，并从而得出结论说，社会主义革命能够在一个国家，在帝国主义锁链中薄弱的一环取得胜利。
    对马克思主义的这一新的贡献——完整的社会主义革命理论，成为俄国无产阶级在其夺取政权斗争中的战斗武器，成为整个国际无产阶级的战斗武器。
    列宁发现苏维埃政权是无产阶级专政最好的国家形式及政权形式，是阶级社会中民主的最高型式。苏维埃国家的历史本身，就证明了这种政权的伟大生命活力。
    列宁首次论证了在一个无产阶级专政的国家内建立完备的社会主义社会的可能。苏联社会主义建设的成就，已证实了列宁的天才预见的生命活力。
    与革命工人阶级的斗争相关的各个知识及实践领域，都曾由列宁加以丰富，由列宁的忠实学生斯大林加以丰富。列宁斯大林增加了马克思主义的思想财富，把它推进到新的、更高的阶段。
    斯大林教导说：“列宁主义是帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。更确切些说：列宁主义一般是无产阶级革命底理论和策略，特别是无产阶级专政底理论和策略。”（“论列宁主义基础”）
    斯大林在与革命理论和革命政党的各种敌人的残酷斗争中捍卫了列宁主义，更加紧密地把共产党的队伍团结在这面崇高的旗帜下。列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林不断地丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库，勇敢地把革命科学推向前进。为斯大林所发展了的列宁主义思想，已掌握了广大的人民群众，它们已成为一支用共产主义原则改造世界的百战百胜的力量。斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”是马克思列宁主义发展中的最高阶段。斯大林创造地发展了列宁主义，武装并动员世界上一切劳动者为争取共产主义胜利进行斗争。
    斯大林在他的新著中全面地探讨了社会主义社会中社会生产及物质财富分配的法则，发现了社会主义的基本经济法则及现代资本主义的基本经济法则。斯大林提出了准备由社会主义过渡到共产主义的三个基本先决条件。
    第一，斯大林同志教导说，必须切实保证全部社会生产的不断增长，而生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位。
    第二，必须用实行起来有利于集体农庄因而也有利于整个社会的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，而商品流通也要代之以产品交换制。
    第三，必须使社会达到这样高度的文化发展，保证社会一切成员全面发展他们的智力和体力，使社会成员能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育。
    斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和他在十九次党代表大会上的演说构成了十九次党代表大会各项有历史意义决议的基础，并以强有力的光芒照亮了世界上一切正直人们的斗争道路。
    列宁与斯大林不仅是伟大的马克思主义理论家，而且他们是革命领导工作的最高能手，是千百万劳动群众的及为解救各族人民免于压迫及剥削的斗士的久经考验的领袖。
    列宁与斯大林创建并锻炼了新型的政党—强大的共产党，它是我们时代的智慧，荣誉和良心。由崇高理想所武装起来的共产党，曾引导俄国劳动人民进行十月社会主义革命并取得胜利，在国内战争时期它曾领导苏维埃人民同国内外敌人斗争并取得胜利，曾动员苏联劳动人民恢复被破坏了的经济和实现斯大林的许多建设计划并取得了胜利，在卫国战争中它发动苏维埃人民反对法西斯侵略者并取得具有全世界历史意义的胜利。党为了争取社会主义这一共同目标团结广大人民群众所进行的整个斗争，便是行动中的马克思主义。
    列宁与斯大林认为共产党的独特作用就在于它是苏联社会主义一切胜利的领袖和组织者。伟大的世界改造者科学地证明了政党的意义，确定了它在社会主义国家体系中，在建设共产主义社会整个斗争中的领导地位。列宁斯大林对人民的战斗先锋队—共产党的行动，给予了鲜明的纲领。
    列宁与斯大林经常教导党要巩固自己同人民的联系，任何时候也不要脱离人民。共产党之所以强大有力，正在于它同人民的这种联系，在于人民对它的无限信任、热爱和忠诚。五十多年以来共产党的历史已清楚地向人民表明，共产党是人民利益的始终不渝的可靠代表者，是人民的领袖和教师。党与人民紧密联系的基础，是他们的利益及目的的共同性，是他们在同一的旗帜下—列宁斯大林旗帜下所进行的共同斗争。
    列宁斯大林发展了马克思主义，从理论上论证并实现了必须经常巩固苏维埃国家的原理。斯大林指出，即使在共产主义条件下，如果资本主义包围还存在着，如果外来军事进攻的危险还没有消灭的话，国家仍然要保存的。
    斯大林根据列宁的各项原理制定并实现了国家工业化与农业集体化的巨大纲领。几个斯大林五年计划，把先前技术经济落后的国家变成了拥有高度发展的集体农业的强大工业国家。在伟大的卫国战争年代里，这种威力表现得特别明显。在列宁的旗帜下，在天才的指挥官斯大林的领导下，苏维埃人民在卫国战争中取得了全世界历史意义的胜利并从法西斯奴役威胁下拯救了人类。
    列宁教导说：“共产主义是苏维埃政权加全国电气化。”根据列宁的指示，苏维埃人民在斯大林的领导下在国家电气化方面进行了巨大的工作。第五个五年计划规定了和平的共产主义建设的广阔纲领，其中包括了进一步扩大电力生产。全体苏维埃人民正在胜利地实现着这一纲领。
    列宁为党制订了在新的社会主义原则上改造农业的计划。根据列宁的合作社计划，党吸引了广大的劳动农民群众参加了社会主义建设事业。社会主义的工业及工人阶级对农民的领导决定了这个计划的现实性。斯大林根据列宁的指示，制订并实现了农业集体化的纲领。全面集体化及在此基础上消灭富农阶级，使农村中的历史变革成为可能，这一变革，像斯大林所指出的，就其后果来讲，是与一九一七年十月的革命变革具有同样意义的。
    列宁主义是伟大的国际主义学说。它活在苏联人民胜利的共产主义建设事业中，活在伟大友爱的中国人民建设新生活的劳动和各人民民主国家的成就中，活在殖民地与附属国人民的解放斗争中。
    列宁—斯大林关于工业化，特别是关于农业社会主义改造的原理，成为各人民民主国家共产党及工人党活动的基础。苏联集体农庄制度的胜利及各人民民主国家农民合作化的成就，都是列宁主义无可置疑的胜利。
    苏联人民已开始了那种全世界人民迟早都必然要从事的事业。从苏维埃国家实现的事业中，已看见全人类的明天。列宁说：“……所有一切国家正是从俄国的榜样中就能看见它们在不远将来所必然会遇到的某些事件，而且是极重大的事件。”（“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）
    列宁的预言实现了。现在，成亿的欧亚人民仿效着苏联人民的榜样踏上了社会主义的途径，他们与苏联一起，组成了争取和平、民主与社会主义的强大阵营。
    斯大林在十九次党代表大会的演说中指出，苏联共产党光荣地完成了世界革命运动和工人运动“突击队”的作用。
    列宁教导说，苏维埃国家的力量在于劳动人民群众的觉悟。列宁指出：“依我们看来，国家之所以有力正是由于群众的觉悟”。苏联共产党在自己的领袖与导师斯大林的领导下进行了巨大的群众性的共产主义教育工作。由社会主义到共产主义的过渡，要求不断提高全体人民的觉悟。列宁主义是共产党和苏维埃国家全部思想工作的基础。
    马克思列宁主义理论使人能够在环境中确定方向，了解周围事变的内在联系，预见到事变的进程并辨别它们进一步发展的前景。
    “马克思主义”，如斯大林所下的定义，“是关于自然和社会发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学。”
    以马克思列宁主义所武装起来的全世界的正直人们，正勇敢地瞻望着前面。他们望见了自己光辉的未来。（本报特约稿）
