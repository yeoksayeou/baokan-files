The people of Xilaozhuang Township, Changcheng District, Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, are all talking about it: "This year is like a new world, the township cadres have changed!" Indeed, the style of the cadres in Xilaozhuang Township has changed, and the way they arranged work this spring is very different from last year.

"Good things have been ruined!" This was the criticism of the spring work last year by the people's representatives of the township at the representative meeting. This spring's work has further proved that this criticism is completely correct. Just compare a few specific tasks!

Xilaozhuang Township is divided into three villages, with 390 households and only 167 full-time laborers. Last year's well-digging plan was 300 wells, an average of nearly two wells for each full-time laborer. It would take eighteen days for a full-time laborer to dig a clay well, regardless of wind and rain, so this plan was obviously impossible to complete. However, the township cadres did not calculate this, they put their fingerprints on the task at the district level and divided 100 wells to each village. The village then "held meetings to mobilize" and "every household dug wells." This was the only method last year. At the first meeting, big principles were discussed, but no one took action afterward; after the second meeting, still no one took action. "A deadline of three days!" "Another deadline of three days!" Still no good, so another meeting was held. A meeting every three days, then every two days, with meetings lasting most of the night. The district cadres had one approach, the township cadres another, and the people who went to the meetings either slept or sneaked away. Later, the cadres "armed guards for the meeting" and went door-to-door urging people. The masses were forced to move, with wives and children all out, and the township and village cadres supervised the work at the village entrance. Zheng Guangmei still didn't want to dig, so the township militia captain "armed-urged" him. Households without labor were forced to pay 30,000 yuan to hire someone to dig a well. Everyone was busy for a while, and there were "holes" everywhere in the fields, roadsides, and ditches. The township cadres went to the district to "report their achievements" for "exceeding the task." However, of the 300 wells dug, only two were effective. The masses were very dissatisfied and said, "The higher-ups assign, the lower-ups distribute, digging some holes, ruining some land, reducing grain production, and wasting effort."

Last year's loaning of fertilizer was also done through "meeting mobilization," and those who didn't sign up to buy it were not allowed to go home to sleep. Zheng Zaijian said to his wife, "We don't have money to buy it, we'll have to stay up all night tonight!"

Last year, when controlling cotton pests, the township and village cadres transported ninety catties of cotton oil soap (4,000 yuan per catty) from the district cooperative. Under the supervision of Zhao Jichao, the district party secretary, they held meetings overnight to distribute it to the villages, and the villages distributed it to the mutual aid teams. The mutual aid team leaders dared not make decisions, but they couldn't refuse, so they knocked on doors in the middle of the night to distribute it. As a result, some people used it to wash clothes.

Many other tasks, such as loaning waterwheels and new-style plows, also followed the old path of coercive commands. These large meetings, coercion, and "staying up all night" methods caused "chaos," and everyone in the township was worried and unhappy, and production was not active.

"Good things have been ruined!" The villagers' opinions of the village cadres "couldn't be carried away in two baskets." Last November, when arranging winter work, a struggle against bureaucracy and coercive commands was launched from the county to the district, and the county and district leaders sincerely conducted self-criticism. Zheng Zaicheng, the secretary of the Xilaozhuang Township branch, and Wang Shizhen, the township head, also raised opinions to the leaders. They felt that they could not only criticize the leaders, so they held a general meeting of party and league members after returning to the township. In summarizing the work of the year, Zheng Zaicheng only superficially reviewed his leadership responsibility for "ruining good things," without saying anything serious or specific, and without specifying who was responsible. The party and league members saw that they did not seem to be sincerely reviewing, so they criticized the leadership in general, but dared not name names. The problem was not resolved. It was not until the election of the township branch in December that the district committee focused on reviewing the coercive command style in past work, and Zheng Zaicheng gave a more profound review at the meeting, specifically naming and criticizing certain township branch committee members. This allowed everyone to "lift the lid" and launch criticisms, raising a lot of opinions. The township branch committee members also realized, "The party members have so many opinions; if we don't change our style, we won't be able to lead the work." Each branch committee member made a self-criticism at the meeting. At the township people's representative meeting held in January this year, democracy was fully promoted, and criticisms were launched. Township head Wang Shizhen had always used coercive commands. In the past, he only made self-criticisms without correcting his behavior, so the representatives criticized him, saying, "Wang Shizhen only makes self-criticisms without correcting himself, he can no longer be elected." As a result, after a period of evaluation and debate, Qiu Guangfu, the secretary of the No. 3 Village party branch, who was active in his work and able to maintain close ties with the masses, was elected township head, and Zheng Ruzhi, the township clerk, was elected deputy township head. The representatives put forward over a hundred opinions, criticizing the township leaders for "only knowing how to use coercive commands and assign tasks, without providing any examples, so good things have been ruined."

Promoting democracy and launching criticisms made the masses feel that this was a big change. This mobilized the masses and educated the cadres. Zheng Zaicheng deeply realized, "In the past, the masses didn't dare to speak, so things were difficult to handle; now that everyone is speaking, there are ways to do things." Zheng Ruzhi, although not specifically criticized by the representatives at the meeting, was also deeply educated.

The reason for "ruining good things" was found and reviewed, but how could things be done well? There is no mysterious secret to this. "Cadres and the masses have their ideas meet, speak frankly, discuss matters with everyone, learn methods from everyone, and use facts to mobilize everyone." This is the experience of the cadres in Xilaozhuang Township.

In the past, the township cadres' working method was to hold large meetings to call for action, pushing forward evenly, with each doing their own thing after the meeting. This spring's production work is: first, communicate and arrange things at a joint meeting of all township party members, league members, and mutual aid team leaders. Township cadres focus on key groups, use the power of activists, and implement various tasks based on mutual aid teams; hold small meetings to solve problems, changing the past practice of large "booms." Before arranging work, the township cadres actively collect good people and good deeds, and help key groups to prepare in advance. At the meeting, the masses introduce their own experiences. The Zheng Yunzhou mutual aid team introduced how its team divided labor in spring plowing, how it helped individual households, and how it organized women to hoe wheat and pull pulley carts for well-digging. The Guo Yuheng team introduced how it solved the problems of calculating work points. Li Xiulan mobilized seven women to hoe twenty-one mu of wheat in three days; Wang Huiqing harvested four hundred catties of wheat per mu last year, and introduced how he used fertilizer.

"At this meeting, let everyone speak," "These are all real people and real things, more effective than a long speech by the township cadres." In this way, the work had examples and methods. Finally, Zheng Zaicheng only reminded everyone of what they said and asked each village to publicize it well; he also calculated how much spring land there was in the township, how much time there was left, what was most urgent at the moment, and explained it to everyone. This is how he arranged the work of the whole township. "Cultivate typical examples, use the power of the masses to publicize, and learn methods from the masses." They found the way to work.

This year, well-digging adopted the method of persuasion and typical demonstration. Zheng Zaicheng, the secretary of the township branch, personally took charge of the Zheng Yunzhou mutual aid team and conducted a typical pilot project. He is now starting to dig two wells, and each village has sent people to learn the technique. The twenty waterwheels loaned out last year were not returned, and this year all twenty waterwheels will be installed.

Mobilizing the masses to use fertilizer on wheat fields also started with typical examples. Zheng Peilin, the secretary of the No. 2 Village branch, applied chemical fertilizer to a large mu of wheat field in the east of the village. After a light rain, the wheat changed, becoming dark and oily. Zheng Shoutang's large mu of wheat field next to it was fertilized with manure and bean cakes, which looked yellow and thin compared to Zheng Peilin's wheat. The township cadres mobilized the masses to visit, using examples to promote it, and taught everyone how to use it. The whole township no longer needed to hold meetings to "stay up all night" or go door-to-door to distribute fertilizer. The whole township has borrowed more than 13,000 catties of fertilizer, which has been applied to more than 960 mu of wheat fields.

The promotion of new-style plows did not gain momentum in the township last year. This year, the method of typical demonstration is also being used to promote it. Now, the whole township has newly borrowed twenty new-style plows, and the three from last year have also been put to use.

The township cadres have overcome the style of coercive commands, and good things have been done well. Everyone in the township is happy, production has gained momentum, and most of the wheat fields have been hoeed once, and the spring land has been ploughed. Twenty-eight of the thirty-two mutual aid teams in the township have formulated spring plowing production plans and launched production competitions. Now, the whole township is actively engaged in spring planting.

    诸城县西老庄乡干部转变了强迫命令作风事事都好办了
    程浩
    山东省诸城县昌城区西老庄乡的人们都这样的谈论着：“今年像是换了天下，乡干部变了样啦！” 是的，西老庄乡干部的作风转变了，今年春季布置工作的方法和去年是大不相同了。
    “好事办坏了！”这是乡人民代表在代表会议上对去年春季工作的批评。在今年春季工作中，就更加证明了这个批评是完全正确的。只从几个具体工作上来对比一下吧！
    西老庄乡分三个村，有三百九十户人家，整劳动力才一百六十七人，而去年春天的打井计划是三百眼，每个整劳动力平均将近两眼。一个整劳动力打一眼土井，风雨不隔的也要干十八天，这个计划显然是完不成的。可是乡干部并没有算这个账，他们在区上按了手印，把任务领下来了，分给每个村一百眼。村里就“开会动员”，“家家打井”，这是去年唯一的办法。头一次会上，大道理讲了，会后没有人动手；第二次会后还是没有人动手，“限三天！”“再限三天！”不行，再开会。三天一会，两天一会，一开就是大半夜。区干部一套，乡干部一套，去开会的人呢！不是睡觉，就是偷偷地溜走了。以后干部就“武装保卫会场”，又挨门挨户地催。群众被逼得没法，老婆孩子都出动了，满坡是人，乡、村干部在村头上监工。郑广美还是不愿打，乡武装队长就“武装催办”。没有劳动力的户被逼着出三万元一眼雇人打井。大伙忙了一阵子，地头上，路边上，沟底里，到处挖了些“窟窿”。“超过了任务”，乡干部就到区里去“报功”。可是打了三百眼，只有两眼起了作用。群众很不满意地说：“上级派，下级摊，挖了些窟窿，糟蹋些地，少打了粮食，还白费了力气。”
    去年贷放肥田粉也是“开会动员”，不报名购买就不让回去睡觉。郑在俭对老婆说：“咱没有钱要，今晚上得去熬夜啦！”
    去年治棉虫时，乡、村干部从区合作社运来九十斤棉油皂（每斤四千元），在区委书记赵纪超的督促下，便连夜开会分到村，村分到互助组；互助组长不敢当家，可又不能不办，就三更半夜地敲门打户分配了下去。结果有的人就拿来洗了衣服。
    还有很多的工作如贷放水车、新式步犁等等，也多半照样走着强迫命令的老路。这种大会连大会、强迫、“熬鹰”的办法，弄得“鸡飞狗跳墙”，全乡的人都愁眉苦脸，生产也不起劲了。
        “好事办坏了！”各村群众对乡村干部的意见“两筐也挑不了”。去年十一月，在布置冬季工作时，从县到区都开展了反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令的斗争，县、区负责人都虚心地进行了检讨。西老庄乡支部书记郑在成、乡长王世贞对领导也提了意见。他们觉得不能光批评领导，回乡后也开了全乡的党、团员大会。郑在成在总结一年工作中，对于“好事办坏了”的领导责任，只浮皮搔痒地作了检讨，不说严重的，不说具体事，不指明谁负责，党、团员看他们没有认真检讨的样子，就笼统地批评了一下领导，但也不敢指名。问题没得到解决。一直到十二月改选乡支部的党员大会上，区委又着重地检讨了过去工作中的强迫命令作风，郑在成这才在会上作了比较深刻的检讨，指名举例地批评了某些乡支部委员。这样大家也揭开“葫芦盖”，展开了批评，提了一大堆意见。乡支部委员也才认识到：“党员同志还有这么些意见，如不转变作风，可就不能领导工作了。”每个支部委员都在会上作了检讨。今年一月召开的乡人民代表会议上，又充分地发扬了民主，开展了批评。乡长王世贞，一贯强迫命令，他过去老是光检讨不改正，所以代表们都批评他说：“王世贞光检讨不改正，不能再选他了。”结果，经一番评比、争论，工作积极、能密切联系群众的三村中共支部书记邱广福当选了乡长，乡文书郑汝悌当选了副乡长。代表们提出了一百几十条意见，批评了乡的领导干部：“光会强迫命令、摊派任务，拿不出样子，所以好事办坏了。”
    发扬民主，开展批评，群众就感到这是一个很大的转变。这就发动了群众，也教育了干部。郑在成深深体会到：“过去群众不敢说话，所以事就不好办；现在大伙说话了，工作就有了门路了。”郑汝悌在会上虽没被代表们指名批评，也深深受了教育。
    “好事办坏了”的原因找到了，检讨了，可是怎样才能办好呢？这里没有什么奥妙的门道。“干部和群众思想见了面，把话说透，有事同大伙商量，跟大伙学办法，拿事实来动员大家。”这就是西老庄乡干部的体会。
    过去，乡干部的工作方法是开大会号召，平推平进，会后各干各的。今年春季生产工作是：先在全乡党、团员、互助组长联席会上传达布置，乡干部分头掌握重点组，运用积极分子的力量，以互助组为基础贯彻各项工作；开小会解决问题，转变了过去大“轰”的作法。在布置工作以前，乡干部就积极地搜集好人好事，帮助重点组打好谱，会上由群众自己介绍。郑云州互助组，介绍了他组春耕中劳动力怎样分工，怎样帮助单干户，怎样组织妇女锄麦、打井拉滑车。郭玉恒组介绍了怎样解决了计工算账等办法。李秀兰怎样发动七个妇女在三天中锄了二十一亩小麦；王惠青去年一亩麦子打了四百斤，怎样使用的肥田粉，也作了介绍。
    “这个会上，让大伙说话”，“都是实人实事，比乡干部讲上一大套还管用。”这样工作有了样子，也有了办法。最后，郑在成只把大家讲的再提醒一遍，要求各村好好宣传；又算了一下全乡有多少春田，还有多少时间，眼前要紧的是什么事，向大伙作了交代，这就布置了全乡的工作。“培养典型，用群众的力量去宣传，办法从群众中学习。”他们找着工作门道了。
    今年打井采用了说服动员和典型示范的作法。乡支部书记郑在成亲自掌握郑云州互助组，典型试办，现已着手先打两眼井，各村都派人来学习技术。去年全乡贷的二十部水车也不退了，今年要把这二十部水车都安装起来。
    动员群众用肥田粉上小麦地也从典型做起。二村支部书记郑培林在村东的一大亩麦田里，施上了化学肥料，一场小雨后，麦子变了样，黑油油的。邻地郑守堂的一大亩麦田施了厩肥和豆饼，比起郑培林的小麦，就显得黄瘦的多了。乡干部就发动群众参观，用实例进行宣传，并教给大家使用办法。全乡再不用开会“熬鹰”、挨门挨户地去派肥田粉了。全乡已贷到肥田粉一万三千余斤，上了九百六十多亩小麦地了。
    新式步犁的推广，去年在全乡算是没有打开阵势。今年也用典型示范的办法来推广，现在全乡已新贷到新式步犁二十部，去年的三部也下了地。
    乡干部克服了强迫命令作风，好事就办好了，全乡的人都高兴，生产来了劲头，麦田已大部锄过一遍，春地已经耕完。全乡三十二个互助组，有二十八个订出春耕生产计划，发起了生产竞赛，现在，全乡正积极地投入了春种。
