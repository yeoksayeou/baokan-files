On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland

    State-owned farms in Northeast China actively prepare for spring plowing
    State-owned farms in Northeast China are actively preparing for spring plowing.
    All state-owned farms in Northeast China have undergone reorganization and asset inventory this year, further strengthening their management. In terms of production management, each farm stipulates that 1,000 hectares constitute one rotation area, and two to three rotation areas constitute one operational area. Each operational area is contracted to a production team responsible for cultivation, in order to change the past situation of no one being responsible, wastefulness, low yields, and high costs. Larger farms have also improved their labor organization, establishing strict responsibility systems and technical inspection systems. After reorganization, the farms directly under the Northeast State-owned Farm Administration Bureau can cultivate an area of 16 hectares per person this year, 4.5 hectares more than last year; each tractor can cultivate an area of 220 hectares, 32 hectares more than last year.
    Currently, the machine repair work of state-owned farms in Northeast China has been completed, and the mechanical oil needed for spring plowing has been prepared, with some oil already transported to the operational areas; the seeds have been carefully selected, and the "vernalization" treatment of wheat seeds has been widely tested; the results of manure accumulation also exceed those of previous years.

    Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative sets a plan to increase grain production by 45 jin per mu
    In early March, as the land began to thaw, all members of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, immediately began preparing for spring plowing.
    The cooperative's production plan for the second quarter of this year is based on the requirement of increasing grain production by 45 jin per mu compared to last year, across the cooperative's 443 mu of land. To achieve the annual production increase plan, the following tasks must be completed in the second quarter: plowing, harrowing, and leveling all autumn fields three times each; 80 percent of the land will be plowed with horse-drawn plows and new-style walking plows, with the remaining small plots plowed with old plows, requiring a plowing depth of five to seven inches. All land will be sown with improved varieties, all seeds will be soaked and treated, ensuring timely sowing and complete seedling emergence; wheat fields will be hoed once during the Qingming Festival, with 10 dan of topdressing fertilizer applied per mu; 300 mu will be sown on barren hills, 50 mu of fruit trees will be cultivated, and 20 trees for timber production will be planted per person, with a survival rate of 90 percent required.
    The cooperative has implemented a contracting system for work and output this year, and the labor organization is more rational than last year. Li Shunda constantly conducts patriotic education and socialist future education for the members. Therefore, the labor enthusiasm of all members is very high. Patriotic production increase competitions have been launched between production teams and among members, and labor efficiency has significantly improved. On March 19, the cooperative's 35 male laborers and 20 female laborers built 12 earth kilns, which can produce 5,000 dan of fertilizer. Sowing 35 mu of barren hills was originally planned to require 35 workdays, but only 30 workdays were used. In total, the cooperative saved 150 workdays in 20 days of production. (Guan Zhenzhong)

    A Great Joy for Uyghur Farmers in Production
    Uyghur farmers in Hotan Prefecture, southern Xinjiang, have begun spring plowing. This year, they have newly acquired more than 26,000 pieces of iron farm tools, which is a great joy in local agricultural production. The seven counties under Hotan Prefecture, including Hotan, Yutian, Moyu, Lop, Cele, Pishan, and Minfeng, are all located on oases on the northern foothills of the Kunlun Mountains and the southern edge of the Tarim Desert, more than 5,000 li away from Dihua. The region is remote, transportation is inconvenient, and there is an extreme shortage of iron farm tools. Some farmers still use wooden plows and wooden sticks for cultivation. Last winter, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government allocated a batch of iron materials to Hotan Prefecture and ordered cooperative societies in various counties to organize blacksmiths and carpenters to manufacture various farm tools. Before spring plowing this year, 21,000 mattocks and more than 5,000 plowshares were supplied to local farmers at low prices. A second batch of approximately 150,000 farm tools is being rushed into production and is expected to be supplied to farmers of all ethnic groups in July during the summer hoeing season.

    Shenyang Canal Strives to Release Water Before National Day
    The Shenyang City Canal Reconstruction Project will continue construction in early April. Last year, this project completed 17 kilometers of the riverbed and dug a lake shape. This year, the main tasks are digging the lake and renovating the riverbed, as well as carrying out some ancillary projects. This year's engineering volume includes 509,900 cubic meters of earthwork alone, the construction of nine culvert projects, the transportation of more than 47,000 cubic meters of residual soil, the construction of more than 7,400 cubic meters of roadbed, and the piling up of three artificial mountains. To prevent future flood disasters and raise the lake water level to facilitate people's recreation and boating, three sluice gates will be built along the river. In addition, a concrete bridge, three wooden bridges, and one drainage pipe and culvert, each 12 kilometers long, will be built. This project is planned to be completed by the end of November this year, striving to release water before National Day.
    This phase of the project requires a total of more than 526,000 man-days of labor and approximately 22 billion yuan in funding. More than 3,000 workers are now prepared to participate in this project to improve the health and happiness of the city's people.

    Northwest China Actively Produces Construction Materials
    The Factory Management Department of the Northwest Construction Engineering Bureau has a very heavy task of supplying materials this year. In addition to producing a large number of bricks and tiles, it will also produce several times more lime and gravel than last year, process more than 100,000 cubic meters of wood, and manufacture a large number of steel windows, hand-pushed flatbed carts, and heating and sanitary equipment. To complete these tasks, they began preparing at the end of last year: training more than 300 workers during the winter slack season, adding machinery and factory buildings, and storing and transporting sufficient production raw materials.
    Currently, all factories have begun mass production. The enthusiasm of the workers is constantly increasing. The No. 1 Lumber Mill produced 30 cubic meters of wood per saw per day last year, and now it has increased to 40 cubic meters; the 14 apprentices who were transferred to the Furniture Department in the second half of last year can now independently operate the machines. Workers in the forging shop of the No. 1 Hardware Factory renovated their tools, increasing the efficiency of forming flat car frames from one frame per six people per day to 52 frames; the production of flat car iron sleepers increased from 24 sleepers per four people per day in the past to 400 sleepers per eight people per day.

    Anshan Market Will Have Great Development
    Since the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company began large-scale capital construction, a large number of experts, technicians, ordinary workers, and their families have come to Anshan. They not only require daily necessities from the market, but also various household utensils. The purchasing power of Anshan citizens is very high. Last year, the average income per person was approximately equal to the total income of six farmers. To meet market needs, state-owned trading enterprises in Anshan continue to expand their operations. The Anshan Department Store Company has decided to change to a department store wholesale station. Currently, the company's buyers have gone to Tianjin and Shanghai to organize the supply of goods, and have also sent people to investigate the needs of residents in the workers' residential areas. The local native produce company plans to purchase live pigs in neighboring counties this year and send buyers to be stationed in fish-producing seaports, striving to supply employees with fresh fish and meat in a timely manner. The Anshan City People's Government plans to double the area of vegetable gardens in the suburbs. The Anshan Cooperative will purchase a large number of fruits from the south this year. The supply of citizens' daily necessities will also be improved.

    东北各国营农场积极准备春耕
    东北各国营农场正积极准备春耕。
    东北各国营农场今年都经过整编和清理资财工作，进一步加强了经营管理。在生产管理上，各农场规定以一千公顷为一轮作区，两个到三个轮作区为一个作业区，每一作业区都由生产队专责包耕，以改变过去无人负责、浪费铺张、产量低、成本高的现象。规模较大的农场还改进了劳动组织，建立了严格的责任制和技术检查制。东北国营农场管理局直属各农场经过整编后，今年每人负担耕作面积可达到十六公顷，比去年多四点五公顷；每台拖拉机耕作面积可达到二百二十公顷，比去年多三十二公顷。
    现在，东北各国营农场的机器修理工作已完成，春耕所需的机械油料已准备妥当，有的已把油料运送到作业区；种籽已经过精选，并普遍试验了麦种“春化处理”；积肥工作的成绩也超过往年。

    三月初土地开始解冻，山西平顺县李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社全体社员，立即着手准备春耕。
    该社今年第二季度的生产计划，是根据全社四百四十三亩地，每亩比去年增产四十五斤粮食的要求制订的。为了实现全年增产计划，第二季度须完成下列工作：把全部秋田耕、耙、耢各三遍；百分之八十的土地使用马拉犁和新式步犁耕犁，其余的小块地用旧犁套耕，要求耕深五寸到七寸。全村土地普遍播种优良品种，全部种籽实行浸种、拌种，保证适时播种，出苗齐全；清明节普遍锄麦地一次，每亩施追肥十担；在荒山播种三百亩，栽培果树五十亩，每人植生产木料树二十株，成活率要求达到百分之九十。
    该社今年已实行包工包产制，劳动组织已较去年合理。李顺达不断对社员进行爱国主义教育和社会主义的前途教育，因此，全体社员的劳动积极性很高。生产组之间和社员之间，已开展了爱国增产竞赛，劳动效率显著提高。在三月十九日一天中，全社男劳力三十五人，女劳力二十人，垒成土洞十二个，可熏肥五千担。荒山播种三十五亩，原计划用三十五个工，结果只用了三十个工。总计二十天的生产中，全社共省工一百五十个。（关振中）
    维吾尔族农民生产上的大喜事
    新疆南部和阗专区的维吾尔族农民已开始春耕，今年他们新增置了两万六千多件铁制农具，这是当地农业生产上的一件大喜事。和阗专区所属和阗、于阗、墨玉、洛浦、策勒、皮山、民丰等七个县，都在昆仑山北麓和塔里木大沙漠南端的绿洲上，离迪化约有五千多里，地区偏僻，交通不便，极端缺乏铁制农具，有些农民到现在还用木犁、木棒耕作。去年冬天，新疆省人民政府拨给和阗专区一批铁料，并令各县合作社分别组织铁匠、木匠，制造各种农具。今年春耕以前，已有两万一千把砍土镘、五千多个犁铧廉价供应当地农民。第二批农具约十五万件正在继续赶制中，预计在今年七月夏锄时节，将全部供应各族农民。（新华社）
    沈阳市运河争取在国庆节前放水
    沈阳市改建运河工程将于四月初旬继续施工。去年这项工程已完成了十七公里长的河身，挖好了湖形。今年主要是挖湖和修整河身，并进行一些附设工程。今年的工程量仅土方工程即有五十万九千九百立方公尺，要修建涵管工程九处，并要运出残土四万七千多立方公尺，修筑路基七千四百多立方公尺，堆起三座假山。为防止将来雨水成灾，并提高湖水水位，便利人们游玩划船，沿河将修筑三座水闸。此外，还要修建混凝土桥一座、木桥三座，排水管和暗渠各一条，全长十二公里。这项工程，计划在今年十一月底全部完成，争取在国庆节前放水。
    这一期工程共需五十二万六千多个人工和约二百二十亿元的经费。现已有三千多名工人准备参加这一增进全市人民健康和幸福的工程建设。
    西北积极生产建筑器材
    西北建筑工程局工厂管理处，今年的器材供应任务很繁重。除大量生产砖、瓦外，并将生产比去年大数倍的石灰、石碴，加工十余万立方公尺的木材，制造大批的钢窗、手推平车、暖气卫生器材等。为了完成这些任务，他们从去年年底就着手进行准备工作：利用冬闲期间，训练了三百多工人，增加了机器及厂房，并储运了足够的生产原料。
    目前各厂已开始大量生产。职工们生产积极性不断提高。制材一厂去年每天每台锯产三十立方公尺木材，现在已提高到四十立方公尺；家具部去年下半年调来的十四名学徒，现在都能单独掌握机器。五金一厂锻工间工人改造工具，使窝平车框子的效率由每天六个人做一个提高到五十二个，窝平车铁枕木过去每天四人做二十四个，现在已提高到每天八个人做四百个。
    鞍山市场将有很大发展
    随着国营鞍山钢铁公司开始大规模基本建设以来，大批的专家、技工、普通工人和他们的家属来到了鞍山。他们不但要求在市场上买到日常必需的生活用品，而且还需要各种粗、细家庭用具。鞍山市市民的购买力都很高，去年平均每人收入约等于六个农民收入的总和。为适应市场需要，鞍山各国营贸易企业不断扩大经营，鞍山市百货公司已决定改为百货批发站。目前该公司的采购员已到天津、上海组织货源，同时派人在工人住宅区调查居民需要。当地土产公司今年准备在邻近县份收购活猪，并派采购员常驻产鱼海口，争取及时供应职工以新鲜鱼肉。鞍山市人民政府计划把市郊菜园面积扩大一倍。鞍山市合作社今年将向南方采购大量水果。市民日常生活用品的供应情况也将得到改善。
