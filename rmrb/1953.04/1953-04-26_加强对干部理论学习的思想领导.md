Strengthen Ideological Leadership in Cadre Theoretical Study
Sha Ying

    The "Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Cadre Theoretical Education for 1953-1954" stipulates the content and methods of theoretical study for cadres throughout the party. This will further consolidate the cadre theoretical study system and advance it a step further. In order to better implement this directive of the Party Central Committee, we must strengthen ideological leadership in cadre theoretical study.
    Through studying Comrade Malenkov's report and Comrade Stalin's works, our cadres across the country have not only gained a clear understanding of the current international situation and learned guiding principles for our economic construction from the Soviet Union's construction experience, but also extensively carried out criticism and self-criticism, powerfully exposed bureaucracy, thereby improving their ideological level and improving various tasks. Through this study movement, we have organized a vast study force. According to incomplete data, more than 1.2 million cadres across the country are now participating in the study. Senior cadres in various regions have been universally organized to actively participate in the study, and many principal responsible cadres have actively led the study, establishing strict study systems and study discipline. This is a good foundation for further implementing the directives of the Party Central Committee and strengthening cadre theoretical study in the future.
    How to consolidate the already organized cadre theoretical study and enable future theoretical study to yield greater gains is an important issue. In the past, Party committees at all levels generally emphasized organizational leadership, that is, mobilizing everyone to participate in the study, establishing study systems and discipline, and conducting inspections and supervisions to ensure the development of the study movement. This is undoubtedly very necessary and correct, and these will still be necessary in the future. At present, the development of the study movement is still uneven. Some units study better and gain more, while some units study worse and gain less, and some units even show signs of relaxation. These all indicate that the organization and system of our cadre theoretical study are not very solid. Therefore, organizational leadership cannot be ignored or relaxed in the future. However, we cannot limit ourselves to organizational leadership in cadre theoretical study; we must also strengthen ideological leadership in cadre theoretical study. Because leading cadre theoretical study is, after all, an ideological work, and if we do not pay attention to ideological leadership in ideological work, there can be no better results. Recently, various places have also raised this issue when summarizing the cadre theoretical study during this period. This deserves our special attention.
    How to strengthen ideological leadership in cadre theoretical study? First of all, we must resolve certain ideological problems concerning theoretical study. Although the vast majority of cadres have now recognized the importance of theoretical study and have all joined the study ranks, and such arguments as "not studying theory still allows us to work as usual" and "too busy with work to have time to study" are also rare, this does not mean that our cadres have completely correct views and attitudes towards theoretical study and have no ideological problems. For example, some comrades have little determination to study, lack perseverance, have a low level of awareness, have no study habits, slack off when they are busy with work, and want to retreat when they encounter difficulties; some comrades are overly ambitious and have impatient emotions, not advancing steadily, but desperately rushing, fantasizing about achieving success in one fell swoop; some comrades regard theoretical works as "encyclopedias," hoping to find ready-made answers to all "practical problems" as soon as they open them, and hoping to learn something today and apply it tomorrow, preferably learning a section and solving a specific problem; some comrades regard being assigned to a study group as a "political privilege," and although their cultural level is not high, they insist on being assigned to an intermediate or advanced group for the sake of "face." Such ideological situations still exist among many of our cadres. Therefore, Party committees at all levels and comrades leading the study must deeply understand this situation and resolve it appropriately. This is a more detailed work that requires patient persuasion and education and specific guidance, and absolutely cannot be done in a crude and simplistic way. Only in this way can we put the study on the right track, correct everyone's study attitude, give full play to everyone's study consciousness and creativity, and fully tap the "potential power" in the study.
    Secondly, we must promptly answer difficult questions in the study. No matter what unit or individual, some difficult questions will arise in the study. If these difficult questions are not answered, they will hinder the smooth progress of the study. Therefore, Party committees at all levels and comrades leading the study should do their best to help answer questions. Of course, this is difficult. Because many leading comrades in various places are very busy, and the problems in the study are very complex, some problems are indeed not easy to answer. But this difficulty is not insurmountable. First, as long as everyone carefully studies the documents, conducts independent thinking, and conducts collective discussions, some difficult questions can be resolved. In fact, some questions have already been resolved in the documents, but they are often still debated endlessly in discussion meetings. This is all because the documents have not been carefully read and deeply thought about. Second, the responsible cadres in our units, compared with general cadres, have a higher theoretical level and more experience in struggle. As long as they can take the first step in learning, or learn a little more, after a certain amount of consultation and preparation, many problems can be answered. According to the experience of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the provincial committee itself strives to take the lead in learning, which can not only promptly point out the main points of each chapter to everyone, guide everyone to grasp the central issues, but also promptly answer the general difficult questions raised in the study. Third, problems that cannot be answered by this unit can be answered by comrades with a higher theoretical level outside the unit, or submitted to the higher-level Party committee for answers. The central organs and the Party committees in East China, Northeast China and other places have organized report meetings to answer difficult questions, which have been of great help to everyone's study. In the future, such report meetings should be held as often as possible. If the above methods are adopted, most of the difficult questions in the study can be resolved. In places where full-time theoretical teachers have been established and "study rooms" have been established, difficult questions should be answered in an organized manner. Of course, answering questions should be particularly cautious to ensure correctness; some special and complex controversial issues that cannot be correctly answered for a while may be temporarily reserved for further study. Because the problems in the study are different from policy problems and work problems, they do not necessarily need to be concluded immediately, nor should we hope that all difficult problems should be solved by the Party committee.
    Furthermore, we must constantly improve study methods. The issue of study methods naturally includes many things, such as how to read books, how to take notes, how to hold discussion meetings, and how to write study papers. These should all be studied and improved. However, the most fundamental issue of study methods is the issue of how theory is linked to practice. This is what Chairman Mao has pointed out to us long ago. According to the study situation in various places, there are still two deviations in this regard: one is to cling to terms and circle around in the words without linking to reality or ideas. This is a dogmatic study method. The other is not to read the documents carefully, not to understand the spirit and essence of the documents, and even not to understand certain concepts before "linking to reality" too early, thus pulling in all directions and making a mess. For example, the former Finance Department of the Northeast District spent only one-third of its time reading documents in the study, while two-thirds of its time was spent on discussions. Because everyone did not have a good understanding of the documents, the discussion meetings became aimless rambling meetings. This is an empirical study method. Anyone who adopts these two study methods not only wastes time and energy and has little effect on the study, but also affects everyone's study mood and hinders the persistence of the study. This must be improved.
    In the past period of study, we have also discovered many units with good experience in linking theory to practice. According to their experience, in general, we must first carefully read the documents and read some necessary reference books in order to truly understand the spirit and essence of the documents. For example, senior cadres of units directly under the Central Military Commission particularly emphasized this when studying Comrade Stalin's works. This is certainly correct. Secondly, combine the spirit of the documents with practice, especially with the current general task and the basic tasks of the department, so as to use the learned viewpoints and methods to solve some principal problems in the work and ideology of the department in a purposeful and planned way, thereby achieving the purpose of improving cadres' thinking and improving work. For example, the central-level industrial departments discussed many basic problems in large-scale construction in this study based on the spirit of the documents; the Central Ministry of Water Resources seriously examined the bureaucratic style in the study in conjunction with the documents. Various units in East China determined the focus of study according to the characteristics of each department. The organization department particularly linked cadre work and discipline inspection work in the study of party building issues, and the propaganda department particularly linked ideological work in the study. These are all better methods. This method of linking theory to practice is correct. Experience has shown that the study effect is greater for those who adopt this method. Therefore, Party committees at all levels and comrades responsible for leading the study should pay attention to summarizing and exchanging study experiences, constantly improve study methods, and gradually strengthen ideological leadership. As long as we can lead and help everyone to study well, conduct both organizational leadership and strengthen ideological leadership, our cadre theoretical study will surely achieve better results.

    加强对干部理论学习的思想领导
    沙英
    “中共中央关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，规定了全党干部理论学习的内容和方法，这将使干部理论学习制度更加巩固起来，并向前推进一大步。为了更好地执行党中央的这个指示，我们必须加强对于干部理论学习的思想领导。
    经过学习马林科夫同志的报告和斯大林同志的著作，我们全国各地在职干部不但对目前国际形势有了明确的认识，从苏联的建设经验中学到了对于我们进行经济建设的指导原则，而且广泛开展了批评与自我批评，对官僚主义作了有力的揭发，从而提高了思想水平，改进了各项工作。通过这次学习运动，我们已经组织起来一支庞大的学习队伍。根据不完全的资料，现在全国参加学习的干部已达一百二十万人以上。全国各地的高级干部，普遍组织了起来，积极参加学习，许多主要负责干部并积极领导学习，建立了严格的学习制度和学习纪律。这是今后进一步执行党中央的指示加强干部理论学习的良好基础。
    怎样把已经组织起来的干部理论学习巩固下来，使今后的理论学习能有更大的收获，这是一个重要的问题。过去一个时期，各级党委一般地强调了组织领导，即动员大家参加学习，建立学习制度和纪律，进行检查和督促等等，以保证学习运动的开展。这无疑是非常必要和正确的，就是今后，这些也还是必要的。目前学习运动的开展还是不平衡的，有些单位学得好些、收获大些，有些单位学得差些、收获小些，并且有的单位有些松懈的现象，这些都说明我们干部理论学习的组织和制度还不是很巩固的，因此今后的组织领导还是不能忽视不能放松的。但是，我们对于干部理论学习却不能仅限于组织领导，我们还必须加强干部理论学习的思想领导。因为领导干部理论学习毕竟是一种思想工作，如果对思想工作不注意思想领导，那就不可能有更好的成绩。最近各地在总结这一时期的干部理论学习时，也大都提出了这个问题。这就值得我们特别加以重视了。
    怎样加强干部理论学习的思想领导呢？首先，要解决对待理论学习的某些思想问题。现在虽然绝大多数的干部都已认识到理论学习的重要性，并且已都参加到学习的队伍中来了，“学不学理论还不是照样工作”“工作太忙没有时间学习”等论调也很少了；但这并不是说我们的干部对待理论学习的看法和态度都完全正确了，没有什么思想问题了。譬如说：有些同志对学习的决心不大，缺乏毅力，自觉性不高，没有学习习惯，工作一忙就松劲，一遇到困难就想退却；有些同志好高骛远，有急躁的情绪，不是稳步前进，而是拚命突击，幻想一举告成；有的同志把理论著作当作“万宝全书”，想一翻开就能找到一切“实际问题”的现成答案，今天学了明天就能用上，最好是学一段就能解决一个具体问题；有的同志把学习编组看作是“政治待遇”，虽然自己的文化水平不高，但是为了“面子”关系，硬要编入中级或高级组。诸如此类的思想情况，在我们的不少干部当中还是存在着的。因此，各级党委和领导学习的同志，必须深入了解这种情况，加以适当的解决。这是一种比较细致的工作，需要进行耐心的说服教育和具体指导，绝不能采取粗暴的简单化的办法。只有这样，才能把学习纳入正轨，才能端正大家的学习态度，发挥大家的学习自觉性和创造性，而充分发掘在学习中的“潜在力量”。
    其次，要及时解答学习中的疑难问题。不论任何单位任何个人，在学习中都会发生一些疑难问题，如果这些疑难问题得不到解答，便会阻碍学习的顺畅进展。因此，各级党委和领导学习的同志，要尽力帮助解答问题。当然，这是有困难的。由于各地的许多领导同志工作很忙，学习中的问题又很复杂，有些问题确实不容易解答。但是这种困难并不是不能克服的。第一、只要大家认真钻研文件，进行独立的思考，经过集体的讨论，有些疑难问题是可以得到解决的。实际上有些问题已在文件上解决了，但常常还在讨论会上争论不休，这都是因为没有精读文件和深刻思考的缘故。第二、我们各单位的负责干部，和一般干部比较起来，理论水平毕竟是较高的，斗争经验是较多的，只要能先学一步，或者再多学一点，经过一定的商讨和准备，有许多问题是可以解答的。根据中共松江省委的经验，省委本身的学习力求先走一步，既能及时给大家指明每一章节的学习要点，引导大家抓住中心问题，又能及时解答学习中所提出的一般疑难问题。第三、本单位不能解答的问题，可以请外面理论水平较高的同志来解答，或者提交上级党委解答。中央机关及华东、东北等地的党委，都组织了这种解答疑难问题的报告会，对大家的学习帮助很大。今后，这样的报告会应尽可能经常举行。如果采用以上这些办法，学习中的疑难问题绝大部分是可以解决的。已经设立了专职的理论教员和已经建立了“学习室”的地方，更要有组织地解答疑难问题。当然，解答问题要特别谨慎，保证正确；有些特殊的、复杂的争论问题，一时还不可能得到正确解答的，就不妨暂时保留起来，继续研究。因为学习中的问题不同于政策问题和工作问题，不一定都要马上做出结论，也不要希望一切疑难问题都要党委去解决。
    再其次，要不断改进学习方法。关于学习方法问题，自然包括的很多，例如怎样读书，怎样记笔记，怎样开讨论会及怎样写学习论文等等。这都是应该注意研究和改进的。不过学习方法最根本的问题，是理论如何联系实际的问题。这是毛主席早就给我们指出来了的。根据各地的学习情况看来，目前在这方面仍然有两种偏向：一种是死扣名词，在文字上打圈子，不联系实际，不联系思想。这是教条主义的学习方法。一种是不精读文件，对文件的精神和实质还没有领会，甚至连某些概念还未弄清楚，就去过早地“联系实际”，因而便东拉西扯，乱联一通。例如东北区的前财政部，在学习中阅读文件的时间只占三分之一，而讨论的时间竟占三分之二，由于大家对文件没有很好的了解，所以讨论会便变成了漫无中心的漫谈会。这是一种经验主义的学习方法。凡是采取这两种学习方法的，不仅浪费时间精力，学习效果不大，而且还会影响大家学习的情绪，阻碍学习的坚持，这是必须加以改进的。
    在过去一个时期的学习中，我们也发现了很多单位理论联系实际较好的经验。根据他们的经验，一般的说来，首先要精读文件，并阅读一些必要的参考书，以便真正领会文件的精神和实质。例如中央军委直属单位的高级干部在学习斯大林同志著作时，就特别强调这一点。这当然是正确的。其次，结合文件的精神联系实际，特别是联系当前的总任务和本部门的基本任务，以便运用所学的观点和方法，有目的有计划地来解决本部门的一些工作上和思想上的原则问题，从而达到提高干部思想和改进工作的目的。例如中央一级的工业部门在这次学习中，根据文件的精神，讨论了大规模建设中的许多基本问题；中央水利部在学习中结合文件认真检查了官僚主义作风。华东各单位根据各该部门的特点分别确定学习重点，组织部门在党的建设问题中特别联系干部工作和纪律检查工作进行学习，宣传部门特别联系思想工作进行学习。这些都是较好的方法。这种理论联系实际的学习方法是正确的。经验证明，凡是采取这种方法的，学习效果就大些。因此，各级党委和负责领导学习的同志，应注意总结和交流学习经验，不断改进学习方法，逐渐加强思想领导。而只要我们能很好地领导和帮助大家进行学习，既进行了组织领导，又能加强思想领导，我们的干部理论学习，就一定会得到更好的成绩。
