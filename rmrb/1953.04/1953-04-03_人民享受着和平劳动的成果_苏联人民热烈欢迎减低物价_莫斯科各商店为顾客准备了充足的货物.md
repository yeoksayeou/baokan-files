Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: According to TASS, men and women throughout the Soviet Union are welcoming the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to once again reduce state retail prices of food and manufactured goods with heartfelt gratitude. After the news of the price reductions spread, factories and institutions in various places held gatherings and meetings to discuss this exciting and inspiring decision. At a meeting at the Moscow Three Hills Textile Factory, weaver Ledneva said: This latest price reduction demonstrates our ever-increasing strength. Our government and our own Communist Party are tirelessly working to ensure the prosperity of the people's lives. Today, we are celebrating a joyous holiday.

The people of Leningrad greeted this good news with excitement and encouragement. Electric welder Mikhailov of the Stalin Factory said at a meeting in the factory's hydraulic turbine workshop: This price reduction will make the working people even happier. We Soviet people can be proud to live in a country where the government's primary concern is the welfare of ordinary people.

The people of Soviet Belarus listened attentively to the broadcast about the price reductions. Minsk Tractor Factory assembler Ivan Shishkin talked about his future plans at a workshop meeting. He said: After this price reduction, my family will save 200 rubles a month on food alone. Because we don't need to buy new clothes or new furniture right now, we can use this money to go on summer vacation. This year, we plan to take the whole family to beautiful Crimea for summer vacation.

Workers in the Baku oil fields also held enthusiastic gatherings. Worker Babayev said: Another price reduction can make every citizen and every Soviet family happier. Due to the price reduction, my actual wage has increased by at least 15 percent. The price reduction shows that our country is becoming more and more prosperous, and the people are enjoying all the benefits of peaceful labor.

At a meeting at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, worker Ivanov said: The Soviet working people believe that another price reduction is a concrete manifestation of the great superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist system. He said: Thanks to the care of the Soviet government, our people live a prosperous and happy life.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: According to TASS, on March 31st, after hearing the broadcast from the radio station about the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to once again reduce state retail prices of food and manufactured goods, stores in Moscow immediately began preparing to sell goods at the new prices. Many store employees worked enthusiastically until late at night. Thousands of employees at the Central Department Store, one of Moscow's largest stores, spent the night of March 31st re-pricing approximately 25,000 types of goods they sell. This company has prepared more than 1,200 different grades and patterns of silk fabrics for customers. From April 1st, the price of these silk fabrics will be 15 percent cheaper. Sergei Komolov, the manager of this company, told a TASS reporter: This price reduction will further increase the purchasing power of the Soviet people. Our sales volume is increasing year by year. In the past three months, the total value of goods we sold increased by nearly 30 million rubles compared to the first quarter of 1952. On March 30th alone, customers bought nearly 30,000 meters of textiles, 8,000 pairs of high-quality leather shoes, many suits and coats, as well as electric refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and other supplies at our company. Komolov said that it is expected that the sales volume of our company in April and May will increase by 25 to 30 percent compared to the first quarter.

The Smolensk Square Food Company, one of Moscow's largest food stores, also carried out very intense work. It prepares food for more than 100,000 people every day. It sells approximately 900 kinds of food. Beef, mutton, pork, poultry, and more than 60 kinds of sausages will all be reduced in price by 15 percent. On the night of March 31st, more than 200 kinds of sweets were labeled with new, reduced prices. The shelves were piled high with fruits that had been reduced in price by half—apples, oranges, and lemons.

    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联全国男女以十分感激的心情欢迎苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会关于再次减低食品和制成品国家零售价格的决定。减低物价的消息传出后，各地工厂和机关纷纷举行集会和会议，讨论这一令人兴奋鼓舞的决定。在莫斯科三山纺织厂的集会上，织工列德涅娃发言说：物价的又一次减低表现出我们日益增大的力量。我们政府和我们自己的共产党是不倦地为保证人民生活的繁荣而努力的。今天，我们是在庆祝一个欢乐的节日。

    巴库油田的工人也举行了热烈的集会，工人巴巴耶夫说：又一次减低物价可以使每一个公民、每一个苏维埃家庭过得更加幸福。由于物价的减低，我的实际工资至少增加了百分之十五。物价的减低表示我们的国家越来越富强了，人民享受着和平劳动的一切利益。
    在乌拉尔重型机械制造厂的大会上，工人伊凡诺夫发言说：苏联劳动人民认为又一次减低物价是社会主义经济制度胜过资本主义制度的伟大优越性的具体表现。他说：由于苏维埃政府的关怀，我国人民过着繁荣美满的生活。
