    A New Life in a Hungarian Village
    Hungary Domokos Varga
    In this mountainous country in the Danube basin, there are many small villages. Vaszcsivaky, described here, is one of these villages, with a population of only 674 people.

    This village is probably more than a thousand years old, located at the foot of the mountains in western Hungary, with a small stream winding beside it. There are no factories or mines nearby. Vaszcsivaky can be said to be a typical Hungarian farm village, with the nearest town, Szombathely, sixteen kilometers away, and Budapest two hundred kilometers away.

    In the past, when the old Hungarians talked about these remote small places, they always liked to say, "Even God only takes a look at it every seven years, and only with one eye."

    Indeed, people used to live a solitary and extremely impoverished life here. The land was occupied by landlords, and most of the residents—landless peasants—owned nothing. The landlord Bálint Batthyány's English-style villa overlooked the entire village, but hundreds of meters away were rows of low thatched cottages of the peasants. Two families shared a kitchen. Damp walls often grew mushroom as big as palms.

    Today, the second floor of this landlord's building has become the village cultural club. The farmer's cooperative office is downstairs. Not far from this house are the beautiful new brick houses of the people who used to be serfs, forming the streets of the village. All the land around, down to the last hectare, now belongs to the working farmers who cultivate it.

    Some of them have joined production cooperatives, while others are still working individually. Initially, only former hired laborers joined, but later, former small and middle peasants also voluntarily joined one after another.

    Vaszcsivaky's centuries of serfdom and stagnation have been transformed into a new and vibrant life.

    The construction of new houses is a sign of this transformation.

    As early as 1945, land foundations for building new houses were allocated. Each family, and even each unmarried young person, received a plot of 2,000 square meters. Several houses were built immediately, but most of the project did not begin until 1949, when the farmers asked the government for help. The villagers received a trainload of new bricks, new tiles, concrete, lime, and a large amount of lumber, with the loan scheduled to be repaid in twenty-five years.

    Between the autumn of 1949 and the spring of 1950, half of the houses in this new village were built in this way. At that time, although Vaszcsivaky did not yet have electricity, the wires were installed anyway. In each house, in addition to building a kitchen and a food storage room, a bathroom was also built, although there was no running water at that time. The villagers were confident about the future, believing that these things would come soon.

    The following winter, electricity came to Vaszcsivaky. The farmers quickly developed the habit of using electricity.

    Another huge change in rural life came with the machines. In May 1950, the first six tractors arrived in Vaszcsivaky, decorated with flowers and flags, making a rattling sound as they drove down the street between the two rows of new farmhouses. That was when the state machine station was first established in the village. This machine station was originally located in the former landlord's mansion, but soon a new factory building with sheds, a repair shop, and offices was built outside the village. A year and a half later, this machine station already had 31 tractors, 5 rubber-wheeled towed machines, 26 threshing machines, a combine harvester equipped with harvesting and bundling machines, and many other machines for selecting grains, sowing seeds, fertilizing, etc., and more and more machines were constantly being added to help the working people of Vaszcsivaky and nearby villages to work.

    How surprised they were when the combine harvester arrived and immediately began working in the nearby wheat field! The news spread like lightning, and everyone ran to see it. The oldest man in the village—eighty-nine-year-old István Magyar—also hobbled to the farm, his eyes fixed on the machine as if he were watching a peep show—how quickly that strange fellow "ate" the wheat!

    "Don't you want to get on it?" people jokingly asked him.

    But the old man replied seriously, "Of course I want to get on it. I think no matter how old I am, I will use this machine to thresh a big pile of wheat." A smile spread across his wrinkled but lively face.

    The director of the machine station, József Lába, is a twenty-four-year-old youth. Before liberation, he worked as a small laborer on a farm near the village of Köszeg, and later as a coachman. If Hungary had not been liberated, he probably would not have been able to get ahead in his life—as he himself had sarcastically said, his highest position might have been promoted from dung cart driver to the landlord's carriage driver.

    Besides him, how many people in this small village have been reborn in recent years?

    There's János Viszkocs, who went out to do odd jobs at the age of nine, and soon went to work on the landlord Batthyány's farm. He had no shoes to wear, and in the cold winter he was sent outside to herd cattle barefoot and wearing ragged winter clothes. Because he worked at a very young age, he did not get any opportunity to learn.

    Last year, when he was twenty-two years old, the farmer's cooperative sent him to an agricultural school to study for six months free of charge. Now, he is an excellent expert in the village who uses new scientific methods to grow vegetables.

    The director of the cooperative, István Tóth, belongs to the older generation. He has nine grandchildren, but he still goes to a boarding school for adults in a nearby town—Bobb—to study. In his old age, when he had already become a grandfather, he was finally able to study happily and carefree.

    In Hungary today, where life across the country is constantly active and advancing, a large number of talents who were previously buried have emerged from the masses.

    For example, János Knáb has proven to be the best pig breeder in the country, and he has won the Gold Medal for Labor. The second son of József Czér is an outstanding singer and is now studying at the Budapest Academy of Music, where he has made very successful performances in operas.

    When the people of Vaszcsivaky ask themselves how they actually lived through those days in the past, they are often almost surprised.

    In the past, the women in the village always had to carry heavy bags on their shoulders and walk to the market in Szombathely, a round trip of thirty-two kilometers. But now, 375 of the 674 people in the village have bicycles. In the past, a doctor would not come to the village for years on end. But today, a modern clinic has been established in the village. A doctor from a neighboring village comes once a week to provide medical treatment to the villagers. In case of serious illness, a doctor will come immediately with just a phone call.

    Today, the working people themselves are the masters of the village. The affairs of the village are managed by the village council, which is elected by all villagers through secret ballot. The village council has thirty-one members, who come from all walks of life, including men and women, old and young, farmers and tractor drivers. The elected chairman of the village council is twenty-five-year-old József Nemes, who was born and raised in the village (the old people still call him "Little József"). The village council meets once a month, and the executive department, composed of five members, meets once a week. The chairman has no right to decide on important matters without the approval of the executive department.

    The members of the executive department regard the people's sorrows, joys, hopes, and desires as their own sorrows, joys, hopes, and desires. They want to build up all that the people have been deprived of in the past and give it back to the people.

    674 people live in Vaszcsivaky, and millions of people live in the rural areas throughout Hungary. But the life of the people in this small place truly reflects the life of the people throughout Hungary.

    一个匈牙利乡村的新生活
    匈牙利  多莫柯思·华尔卡
    在这个多瑙河流域的多山的国家里，遍布着许多小乡村。这里所记述的瓦司齐瓦基村，就是这些乡村中的一个，它的居民人数仅有六百七十四人。
    这个乡村大概有一千年以上的历史，它位在匈牙利西部的群山脚下，村旁蜿蜒着一条小溪。邻近没有工厂，也没有矿山。瓦司齐瓦基村可以说是一个典型的匈牙利农庄，最近的小镇是十六公里以外的松巴锡里，布达佩斯远在二百公里之外。
    从前匈牙利的老乡们，在谈起这些偏远的小地方时，总爱说：“就是上帝啊，每隔七年才瞅它一下，而且也只用一只眼。”
    的确，人们从前在这里度着孤寂的极端贫苦的生活。土地都被地主霸占了，大部分居民——无地的农民——自己一无所有。地主巴尔·贝柴列德的英国别墅式的多层高楼俯视着整个乡村，但在距离它数百公尺的地方，却是一排排农民们的低矮的茅舍。他们两家合用一个厨房。潮湿的墙上往往长着手掌般大的蕈菌。
    今天，这个地主楼房的第二层已成了乡村文化俱乐部了。楼下是农民合作社的办公室。距离这所房子不远，排列着从前做过农奴的人们的漂亮新砖房，形成了乡村里的街道。左近所有的土地，一直到最后的一公顷，现在都属于耕耘它的劳动农民。
    他们中间的一些人已参加了生产合作社，另一些人还在单干着。最初加入的仅是从前的雇工，后来，从前的小农和中农也自愿地纷纷加入了。
    瓦司齐瓦基数世纪来的农奴制度和停滞不前的情况，已经变为新的生气蓬勃的生活了。
    在这个转变里，新房舍的建造是一个标志。
    早在一九四五年，便分配了建造新房屋的地基。每一个家庭，甚至每一个未婚的青年人，都分到一块二千平方公尺的地基。几所房子马上先盖了起来，但是大部分工程，直到一九四九年农民们要求政府予以帮助以后，才开始动工。村民们得到了一列车的新砖、新瓦、混凝土、石灰，还有一大批木料，这笔借款预定在二十五年后还清。
    在一九四九年秋季和一九五○年春季之间，这个新村的一半房屋便这样修盖起来了。那时候瓦司齐瓦基虽然还没有电力的供应，但是电线照样儿安装了起来。每所房子里，除了修盖一间厨房和一间食物贮藏室之外，还修好了一个洗澡间，虽然那时也没有自来水。老乡们对于未来都怀抱着信心，他们相信这些东西不久就会来到。
    第二年的冬天，电流来到了瓦司齐瓦基。农民们很快地养成了用电的习惯。
    乡村生活中另一个巨大的转变，是随着机器而俱来的。在一九五○年五月，最初的六部拖拉机来到了瓦司齐瓦基，拖拉机上插饰着鲜花和旗帜，发出轧轧的声响，从位在两列新农舍间的街道上驶过去。那是在国家机器站刚在村中建立起来的时候。这个机器站原先设立在从前的那个地主的宅院里，不久便在村外修起了一座带有敞棚、修理厂和办公室的新厂房。一年半以后，这个机器站已有三十一部拖拉机、五部胶皮轮拖带机、二十六部打谷机、一部安装着收割和打捆机器设备的康拜因机，此外还有许多选谷、播种、施肥等等的机器，而更多更多的机器还要源源不断地添进来，好帮助瓦司齐瓦基和附近乡村的劳动人民们去工作。
    当康拜因机到来并且马上就在近旁的麦田里开始工作的那一天，他们是多么的惊奇啊！消息像闪电般地传了开去，每一个人都跑来看它。村里年龄最大的老人——八十九岁的伊斯特万·马格牙尔——也一跌一拐地来到农场上，他的两眼像看西洋景似地注视着那部机器——那个怪家伙把小麦“吃”得多快啊！
    “您不想登上去吗？”人们玩笑似地问他。
    但是老大爷却严肃地回答道：“我当然想上去。我想不管我的年纪多大，我也会用这个机器打它一大堆麦子的。”在他的多皱的然而富有生气的脸上洋溢着微笑。
    机器站的主任约瑟夫·勒巴是一个二十四岁的青年。在解放之前，他在古兹格村附近的一个农庄上做小工，后来又当车夫。如果匈牙利没有获得解放，恐怕他这一辈子也好不起来——如同他自己曾经讽刺般地说过，他的最高的职务，也许是由粪车夫升为地主的马车夫罢了。
    除了他以外，这一个小村子里还有多少人在最近几年内获得新生呢？
    那久斯·维兹克司，他在九岁时出去当零工，不久又到地主贝柴列德的农庄上做工。他没有鞋穿，在严寒的冬季里赤着脚，披着褴褛的冬衣，被差到外面去放牛。由于他在年龄很小时就做工，他就得不到任何学习的机会。
    去年，在他二十二岁的时候，农民合作社送他到
    一处农业学校里免费学习六个月。现在，他已经是这个乡村里用新的科学方法种植蔬菜的优秀能手。
    合作社的主任伊斯特万·托斯，是属于年老一代的人了。他有九个孙男女，但是他仍然到一个附近的镇市——宝柏——的一所供给膳宿的成人学校里去学习。在他已经做了祖父的老年时代里，才终于能够无忧无虑地痛痛快快地来读书了。
    在匈牙利全国的生活在不停地活跃与迈进的今天，大批从前被隐埋了的天才，从群众中间涌现了出来。
    例如贾诺斯·克纳兹被证明了是全国最好的养猪能手，他获得了金质劳动奖章。约瑟夫·柴尔的第二个儿子是一个卓越的歌唱手，现在正在布达佩斯的音乐学院里学习，他曾经在歌剧中做了很成功的演出。
    当瓦司齐瓦基的人民问一问从前那些日子究竟怎样活过来的时候，常常几乎会感到惊讶的。
    在过去，村中的妇女总要在肩上掮着很重的口袋，步行到松巴锡里镇的市集去，来回要走三十二公里。但是现在全村六百七十四个人中，三百七十五个人已经有了自行车。在过去，成年累月不会有一个医生到村子里来。而今天，村中已经设立了一个近代化的诊疗所。邻村的医生每星期一次专门来为村里的人施行诊疗。遇到情况严重的疾病，只要挂个电话，医生就会马上过来。
    今天，劳动人民自己做了村里的主人了。管理村中事务的是全体村民用秘密投票方式选举出来的村议会。村议会有三十一个委员，他们是从各阶层中间来的，有男有女，有老有少，有农民也有拖拉机手。被推选出来的村议会主席，是在村里土生土长的二十五岁的约瑟夫·涅梅斯（老年人们还叫他“小约瑟”）。村议会每月开会一次，五个委员组成的执行部则每星期开会一次。重要的事件如不通过执行部，主席是无权决定的。
    执行部的委员们把人民的苦恼、欢乐、希望和企求，看成自己的苦恼、欢乐、希望和企求。他们要把过去人民所有被剥夺掉的东西建设起来并把它们交给人民。
    六百七十四个人生活在瓦司齐瓦基，同时有好几百万人民生活在匈牙利全国的农村里。但这个小地方的人民生活，却真实地反映了匈牙利全国人民的生活。
