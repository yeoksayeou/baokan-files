A Review of the Startling Waste in Our Construction
Li Ganzhong, Manager of the First Engineering Company, Northeast Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration

Last year, the waste in our construction was widespread and startling.

In terms of materials, due to chaotic management and blind stockpiling, the value of accumulated materials reached 8.8 billion yuan. Lime alone reached 3,000 tons, enough for all projects this year. The Third Construction Site stockpiled 2.5 million red bricks last year, which were later transported to other construction sites, with transportation costs alone exceeding 150 million yuan. The stockpiling of materials not only affected capital turnover but also damaged the quality of the materials. For example, the Third Construction Site had a large amount of cement, which, due to being stored for too long, could only be used as grade 200 cement instead of grade 400. In terms of transportation, due to unplanned supply, 601 empty train cars ran to Ma'anshan to transport gravel in one instance. The station fined us 8.53 million yuan. In terms of tools, due to poor management, approximately 10,000 cubic meters of model board material were issued, but only 40% was recovered by the end of the year. There was a widespread shortage of scaffolding poles at various construction sites in August and September last year, but the poles were not delivered in large quantities until the projects were nearing completion, resulting in a stockpile of 20,000 poles. The losses of small tools were even greater. In terms of mechanical equipment, clean water pumps were used as muddy water pumps, causing damage. Equipment was not inspected before being sent to the site, and it was only discovered upon use that something was missing. Last year, only 23% of the efficiency of sixteen mixers was realized, and only 30% of the efficiency of twenty-eight vehicles was realized. Due to frequent equipment breakdowns, repair costs significantly exceeded the budget. In terms of financial management, the 1952 final accounts were not completed until early April this year. The profits and losses of many completed projects are still unknown; administrative management expenses were huge. The annual plan for last year was 3.2 billion yuan, but the actual expenditure exceeded 5 billion yuan.

The waste during construction was even more serious. No construction design was made before the start of construction. The Third Construction Site started construction without even a construction site layout plan. Materials were piled up randomly, and they had to be transported back and forth when needed, requiring 40 large trucks just for transporting red bricks, estimated to be a waste of 170 million yuan. The water and power supply at the construction site were insufficient, and work had to be stopped for two hours every day during peak construction periods. Assuming a minimum of 500 people per day for three months, this equals a loss of 10,000 man-days. The First Construction Site did not study the drawings carefully before construction. The drawings specified that no steel bars were required for the column footings, but the construction worker ordered more than three tons of steel bars. The losses caused by poor quality are even more difficult to estimate. For example, the repair shop of the Machinery Factory No. 14 built by the Ninth Construction Site had widespread honeycombing and voids in the beams and columns, making it impossible to run cranes. It had to be converted into an office. The cement covers of more than 1,000 meters of heating trenches at the Twelfth Construction Site had widespread cracks, resulting in a loss of more than 170 million yuan last year. This year, the renovation will require another 170 million yuan. Materials were not well kept, with sand, gravel, bricks, and wood scattered everywhere; the lime was generally weathered and deteriorated. Due to a lack of education for workers, some workers only focused on quantity and earning more money, disregarding quality. Some even laid dry ash when laying block stones, used clear water grouting when building walls, and did not properly compact the pillars. Some workers kicked the mortar troughs downstairs after using the mortar.

The above incomplete materials illustrate that the waste in our enterprise is startling, the losses to the country are simply irreparable, and it seriously hinders the improvement of enterprise management. These serious shortcomings are inseparable from our leadership ideology.

First, we have a supply system mentality and insufficient understanding of the fundamental principle of enterprise management—economic accounting. We only emphasize "quality first" or "the plan is the law of the country and must be completed on time." We rarely mention how to reduce costs and save state funds; therefore, it has fueled some erroneous ideas among lower-level cadres, such as some construction site directors believing that "waste is inevitable in the construction industry," "as long as the task is completed, a little waste doesn't matter," and "not losing money is economic accounting." Many instances of waste originate from this.

Second, these wastes are also due to the serious phenomenon of no one taking responsibility or irresponsibility in our work. This was the case last year, and it is still the case with this year's preparatory work. From the company to the construction site, from big things to small things, the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility is widespread. One construction worker went to direct the workers to construct without looking at the drawings, and the block stone foundation was built crookedly, so another block was added next to it. One construction site director was irresponsible and made the 1 cm thick terrazzo into 3 cm, and the quality was poor and had to be reworked. The Third Construction Site forgot to leave space for the heating radiator in the lecture hall, and had to re-drill holes after the plastering was finished. Because no one was responsible for the construction plan, the workers were idle during the day and worked overtime at night, making the workers dizzy and drowsy while compacting. No one was responsible for technical management. The operating procedures and quality standards were not well explained to the workers. The workers did not know the water-cement ratio. The construction worker said: only add two buckets of water, but the worker did not know and added six buckets of water, so the quality was naturally ruined. No one was responsible for managing the canteen of one construction team, and the employees had to wait three or four hours to eat.

The chaotic phenomenon at the company level is also extremely serious. People push responsibility to each other, and everyone is afraid of taking on more responsibility. As a result, the lower-level cadres ran back and forth many times, and the problem could not be solved. The lower level said that we are like "kicking the ball." The Jilin Engineering Office made several long-distance calls to urge the delivery of spikes for temporary construction. The materials section replied: "It's on the train." The Jilin Engineering Office waited for several days and it still did not arrive. Later, it was discovered that it had not been shipped yet, and the temporary construction had to be stopped. The toolman of the Tenth Construction Site asked the engineering office for ten large trucks to pull materials, but the next day he took his wife shopping. As a result, the ten large trucks waited all day.

This phenomenon of no one taking responsibility and irresponsibility existed in the past and still exists now. In the past, we overestimated the work of our enterprise and thought that there was already a responsibility system. Now it has been proven that this view is incorrect.

Third, the lack of a sound economic management system and an imperfect organizational structure make it difficult to assume the responsibility of supervision during the construction process, which is also a reason for waste. We have a cost division, but there are very few people, and it is actually an empty shell in name only. Our leadership finds it difficult to know the use of funds during the construction process. Only after the final accounts are made after completion can we know what the cost is, and there is no way to talk about grasping the profits and losses during the construction process. We have been doing it in such a muddle-headed way for a year. In financial management, we have had some very incomplete systems, but they are reduced to formalities during implementation. Especially after the start of construction, the leadership was afraid of delaying the progress of the project, so they abandoned the system. Lower-level cadres can write a blank slip at will, and if they don't give money, they will be burdened with a heavy hat: "You are responsible for delaying the construction period."

Fourth, the lack of a planning management system. Many projects are blindly constructed without a plan. There is no construction design before the start of construction, and there is no detailed schedule plan and supply plan after the start of construction. The work is pushed forward and done as much as possible. The construction workers are even more clueless. They finish here today and don't know where to go tomorrow. Materials are used temporarily, and the budget is sent or a blank slip is written temporarily. If it is not delivered, work will be stopped. For example, the Third Construction Site wrote a note to the materials section on the afternoon before preparing to tie the scaffolding, asking for 9,000 kilograms of No. 8 iron wire. But this kind of iron wire cannot be bought on the market. Some construction sites add several budgets in a month. Last year, according to incomplete statistics, there were 580 blank slips for additional materials alone. Some units temporarily could not pay, so they gave IOUs to the sellers. Last year, the stamp tax for IOUs alone cost 2.5 million yuan. Due to the lack of planning management, the leaders and lower-level cadres are clueless, resulting in constant confusion and waste in the work.

Fifth, some employees lack a sense of ownership of state property. Some construction workers believe that "I only care about construction, not whether it is economical or not"; some workers, in order to pursue quantity, do not grout when laying block stone foundations, and send an apprentice to stand guard, and only grout when the construction worker comes; at the site, spikes and iron wires are everywhere. Some sections of the company send a small amount of materials to the construction site and also send a large truck, and the transportation cost is more expensive than the material cost. Some construction sites even use a car for a little handling within the site.

In addition to the above many reasons, the most fundamental and main reason is the bureaucracy of our leading cadres. We often limit the lower level to do a job well in a few days without understanding the situation, or instruct a certain project to be completed within a time limit; but we have failed to study and solve some specific problems reflected by the lower level. We only make plans, but we lack supervision, inspection, and specific assistance. Under the leadership of bureaucracy, commandism, and administrative triviality, the phenomenon of no one being responsible and waste is in fact "approved" to continue to exist.

In order to quickly reverse this situation of no one taking responsibility, and in order to overcome the phenomenon of waste in construction management, we have decided to carry out the following tasks:

1. Carry out a mass movement against waste and irresponsibility, use criticism and self-criticism to inspire employees' patriotism, expose the shortcomings in our construction management, and then further find out the causes of waste and irresponsibility, and establish various management systems, and establish a clear economic accounting point of view among employees. Through this movement, change the bureaucratic work style of the leadership with the help of the masses' exposure.

2. Strengthen planning management, enrich the planning management organization, establish an organization for planning work from the company to the construction site, and transfer special personnel to be responsible for this work; in particular, strengthen the original records and statistics of the construction site, the company sets up a statistics section, and the construction site sets up a statistics team, specializing in leading this work.

For all construction sites where drawings have been sent, budgets should be made and contracts signed before construction starts, to overcome the practice of using and requiring current materials, and emphasize working according to the plan.

3. Establish and improve the financial management organization and system: establish an organization for cost work from the construction site to the company to strengthen cost management, and take the company, engineering office, and construction team as economic accounting units, and the construction site as a cost accounting unit, and independently calculate profits and losses. Establish a special responsibility system for working capital management and fixed asset management in financial management, and try to eliminate and avoid unplanned expenditures.

4. Establish a responsibility system to overcome the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility. The main thing is to establish an administrative special responsibility system, establish a construction site director responsibility system, and clearly divide the business scope of each unit. Establish a special responsibility system for construction technical management, from budget, plan to construction, there are special personnel responsible. The company establishes an independent surveying team, and special personnel are responsible for educating workers on operating procedures and quality standards, and establishes an independent inspection agency, and establishes a strict handover inspection system among workers. Establish a technical supply responsibility system, from procurement, storage, distribution, to use and recycling, there should be a certain system (such as quota material requisition system, contract system, etc.). Establish a welfare and security special responsibility system, and special personnel are responsible for worker welfare. In short, the goal is to achieve that everything is the responsibility of someone.

5. Regularly conduct patriotic ideological education for employees, so that they can establish a sense of ownership to complete the tasks assigned by the superiors. Adopt various forms of propaganda and mobilization, constantly expose the phenomenon of irresponsibility and waste in our work, and vigorously commend employees who love state property and work conscientiously and responsibly to set up flags.

    检讨我们施工中的惊人浪费
    东北有色金属工业管理局  第一工程公司经理  李干忠
    去年，我们施工中的浪费是普遍的、惊人的。
    在材料方面，由于管理混乱与盲目储备，积压的材料价值八十八亿元，仅白灰即达三千吨，可供今年全部工程使用。第三工地去年多储备二百五十万块红砖，以后又运至其他工地，只运费即需一亿五千多万元。由于材料积压，不仅影响了资金周转，而且损害了材料的质量。如第三工地有大量水泥，因放置时间过长，四百号的只能当二百号的用。在运输方面，由于供应无计划，往马鞍石运石子，一次即有六百零一个火车皮跑空。被车站罚款八百五十三万元。在工具方面，由于管理不善，发下去约一万立方公尺模型板料，年末只收回百分之四十。去年八、九月份各工地普遍缺脚手杆，但到工程快竣工了，杆子才大批运来，因此积压的杆子有两万根。小的工具损失更多。在机械设备方面，把清水泵当作泥水泵用，给弄坏了。机械送往现场以前不检查，到用的时候才发现不是缺胳臂就是少大腿。去年十六台搅拌机，只发挥了百分之二十三的效能，二十八台汽车，只发挥了百分之三十的效能。由于设备常坏，检修费就超支很多。在财务管理方面，一九五二年的决算，拖到今年四月初还没有算完，许多工程竣工了，还不知道盈亏；行政管理费开支庞大，去年年计划用三十二亿元，实际上用了五十多亿元。
    施工中的浪费更为严重。开工前没有做施工设计，第三工地连一张施工平面布置图都没有，就开始施工，材料乱堆乱放，用的时候只好来回倒运，仅运红砖即经常需用四十台大车，估计浪费一亿七千万元。工地的水源、电源不足，施工紧张时期每天要停工两小时，如以三个月每天最低人数五百人计算，等于损失一万个人工。第一工地施工前没有很好研究图纸，图上注明柱基不用钢筋，但施工员却将三吨多钢筋下了料。由于质量低劣造成的损失更难估计。如第九工地修建的机械十四厂修理车间，梁柱普遍有蜂窝、狗洞，不能跑吊车，只得改为办公室。第十二工地一千多公尺暖气沟洋灰盖，普遍裂缝，去年就损失了一亿七千多万元，今年翻修，还要用一亿七千万元。材料保管得不好，遍地铺着砂石、砖头、木块；白灰普遍风化变质。由于对工人缺乏教育，有的工人只图数量多，多挣钱，便不顾质量，甚至砌块石铺干灰，砌墙用清水灌浆，打柱子不很好地捣固，有的工人用完灰浆，把装灰槽子从楼上一脚踢下楼来。
    以上这些不完全的材料，说明了我们这个企业中的浪费是惊人的，对国家造成的损失简直无法弥补，而且严重地阻碍着企业经营管理的提高。这些严重的缺点，是与我们的领导思想分不开的。
    首先是我们存在着供给制思想，对企业经营管理的根本原则——经济核算制认识不足。我们只强调“质量第一”，或“计划就是国家法律，必须按时完成”。很少提过如何降低成本，节省国家资金；因此助长了下边干部的一些错误思想，如有的工地主任就认为“浪费是建筑业不可避免的事情”，“只要完成任务，浪费点没啥”，“不赔本就是经济核算”。许许多多的浪费，就是从这里产生的。
    其次，这些浪费也是由于我们工作中存在着严重的无人负责与不负责任现象，去年是这样，今年的准备工作还是这样。从公司到工地，由大事至小事，无人负责现象普遍存在。有一个施工人员不看图纸，就去指挥工人施工，把块石基础砌歪了，又在旁边再加上一块。有一个工地主任不负责任，将一公分厚的水磨石打成三公分，而且质量不好，还要返工。第三工地阶梯教室忘了留暖气包，抹好灰才发现，又得重新打洞。由于施工计划无人负责，白天工人窝工，晚上加班加点突击，使得工人头晕眼花，一边捣固一边睡着了。技术管理无人负责，操作规程与质量标准未很好向工人交代，工人不知水灰比，施工员说：只加两桶水，工人不知道，竟加了六桶水，质量当然搞糟了。有一个工程队的食堂无人负责管理，职工吃饭要等三四个钟头。
    公司一级的混乱现象也极严重，有事互相推诿，谁也怕多负责任，结果下面干部跑了多少趟，问题也不得解决，下边说我们就像“踢皮球”。吉林工程处打来几次长途电话，催要暂设工程用的洋钉，材料科回答说：“上火车了。”吉林工程处等了几天也没有到，后来才发现原来还没有运去，暂设工程只好停工。第十工地工具员向工程处要了十台大车拉料，第二天却领着爱人逛大街去了。结果十台大车等了一整天。
    这种无人负责与不负责任现象过去存在，现在仍然存在。过去我们对自己企业的工作估计过高，认为已经有了责任制，现在证明了这种看法是不对的。
    第三，缺乏周密的经济管理制度，组织机构不健全，在施工过程中很难负起监督的责任，这也是造成浪费的一个原因。我们有一个成本股，但人员很少，实际上是一个有名无实的空架子。我们领导上在施工过程中很难知道资金的运用情况，非待竣工后做出决算，才知道成本是多少，根本谈不到掌握施工过程中的盈亏。我们就是这样糊里糊涂地干了
    一年。在财务管理上，我们曾有过一些很不完全的制度，但执行时流于形式。特别在开工后，领导上怕耽误工程进度，就把制度丢开了。下边干部可以随便写个白条子，不给钱就扣上一个沉重的帽子：
    “耽误工期，由你负责。”
    第四，缺乏计划管理制度。许多工程是在没有计划的情况下盲目施工的，开工前没有施工设计，开工后没有周密的进度计划与供应计划，工作推着干，干多少算多少。施工员、工人更是心中无数，今天干完这里，明天不知上哪儿去干。临时用材料，临时送预算或写一个白条子，送不到就停工。如第三工地在准备绑脚手架的头一天下午，才写了一个条子，向材料科要九千公斤八号铁丝。而这种铁丝在市场上是买不到的。有的工地一个月就追加好几次预算。去年单是追加材料的白条子，据不完全的统计，即有五百八十张。有的单位临时支不出款，就向卖主打欠条，去年仅打欠条的印花税即用了二百五十万元。由于缺乏计划管理，领导和下面干部都心中无数，以致工作中的混乱和浪费现象不断发生。
    第五，部分职工对国家财产缺乏主人翁的态度。有的施工人员认为“我只管施工，不管节约不节约”；有的工人为了追求数量，在砌块石基础时不灌浆，派个徒工去放哨，看见施工员来了才灌浆；在现场里，洋钉、铁丝到处可见。公司里有的科往工地送很少一点材料也要派个大车，车费比材料费还贵。有的工地连场内一点小搬运也要个汽车。
    除了上述许多原因以外，最根本、最主要的原因还在于我们领导干部的官僚主义。我们往往不了解情况就限下面几天作好一件工作，或指令某项工程限期完工；而对下边反映的一些具体问题，则未能很好地研究解决。我们只作计划，但缺乏督促检查与具体帮助。在官僚主义、命令主义和事务主义的领导之下，事实上就“批准”了无人负责与浪费现象继续存在。
    为了迅速扭转这种无人负责的局面，为了克服施工管理上的浪费现象，我们决定要进行以下几项工作：
    一、开展一个群众性的反浪费、反无人负责运动，用批评与自我批评的方法，启发职工的爱国主义思想，揭发我们施工管理上的缺点，然后进一步找出浪费和无人负责的原因，订立各项管理制度，在职工中树立明确的经济核算观点。并通过这次运动，在群众的揭发帮助下改变领导上的官僚主义作风。
    二、加强计划管理，充实计划管理机构，从公司到工地都建立做计划工作的组织，调派专人负责这一工作；特别要加强工地原始记录与统计，公司设统计科，工地设统计组，专门领导进行这一工作。
    凡图纸已送来的工地，都应作好预算、签订合同，然后开工，克服那种现用现要的作法，强调按计划办事。
    三、建立与健全财务管理机构与制度：从工地到公司都建立做成本工作的组织，以加强成本管理工作，并以公司、工程处、工程队为经济核算单位，以工地为成本核算单位，独立计算盈亏。在财务管理上建立流动资金管理、固定资产管理的专责制，尽量杜绝与避免计划外的开支。
    四、建立责任制度，克服无人负责现象。主要应建立行政专责制，建立工地主任负责制，明确划分各单位的业务范围。建立施工技术管理专责制，从预算、计划到施工都有专人负责。公司设立独立的测量队，对操作规程、质量标准有专人负责向工人教育，并设立独立的检查机构，在工人中建立严密的交接检查制度。建立技术供应责任制，从采购、保管、发放，到使用、回收，都应有一定制度（如限额领料制、包干制等）。建立福利、保安专责制，对工人福利由专人负责。总之，要达到事事有人负责的目的。
    五、经常向职工进行爱国主义思想教育，使他们树立主人翁的态度来完成上级交予的任务。采取各种各样的宣传鼓动形式，经常不断地揭发我们工作中的无人负责现象与浪费现象，大力表扬爱护国家财产，工作认真负责的职工，以树立旗帜。
