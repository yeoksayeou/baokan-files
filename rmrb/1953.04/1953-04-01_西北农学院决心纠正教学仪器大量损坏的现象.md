    Northwest Agricultural College Determined to Correct the Phenomenon of Mass Damage to Teaching Instruments

    Xin Shuzhi, Acting President of Northwest Agricultural College, wrote: "The February 12th newspaper published a reader's letter criticizing the mass damage to teaching instruments in our college. After organizing an inspection team for in-depth inspection, an inspection report has been made. The situation of instrument damage in the entire college in the past three years is serious. The reasons for the damage to instruments are that some teachers and students do not cherish state property enough, and the equipment conditions for storage and use of instruments are not good, and the management system is chaotic. The bureaucracy of the Instrument Section of the Academic Affairs Office, which is directly responsible for the custody of the instruments, has made it impossible to correct the above phenomenon in a timely manner. Now, in addition to the Instrument Section having made a self-criticism, we have decided to circulate the inspection report throughout the college, and after the start of school, we will arrange a college-wide study of cherishing public property, and instruct the Academic Affairs Office to establish and improve the instrument management system. In addition, the numbers and reasons for instrument damage mentioned in the original reader's letter of criticism are based on the figures presented by the Instrument Section when it held an exhibition of damaged instruments in January this year. At that time, in order to attract attention, and because the Instrument Section did not have a good grasp of the real situation on weekdays, the figures cited were somewhat exaggerated."

    西北农学院决心纠正教学仪器大量损坏的现象
    西北农学院代院长辛树帜来信：二月十二日报上发表了读者批评我院教学仪器大量损坏的来信。经组织检查组深入检查，已作出检查报告。三年来全院仪器损坏的情况是严重的。损坏仪器的原因是某些师生对国家财产不够爱护以及保管、使用仪器的设备条件不好和管理制度混乱。而直接负责保管仪器的教务处仪器组的官僚主义则使上述现象不能及时纠正。现在除仪器组已作了检讨外，我们决定将检查报告通报全院，并在开学后布置一次全院性的爱护公共财物的学习，和责成教务处建立和健全仪器管理制度。此外，读者原批评信中提出的仪器损坏数字和损坏原因是根据今年一月仪器组举办损坏仪器展览时所提出的数字。当时仪器组为了引人注意，而平日对真实情况也掌握不够，因此所举数字有些夸大。
