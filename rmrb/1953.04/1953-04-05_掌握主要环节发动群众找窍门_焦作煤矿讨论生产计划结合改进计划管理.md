    Grasp the Main Links and Mobilize the Masses to Find Solutions
    Jiaozuo Coal Mine Discusses Production Plans and Combines Them with Improved Planning Management
    In the process of mobilizing the masses to discuss plans, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, based on the actual production situation of the enterprise, has grasped three main links: reducing costs, ensuring safety, and improving planning management. It has led the masses to find solutions and put forward rationalization proposals, achieving relatively significant results.
    The work foundation of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine is relatively good. Last year, it overfulfilled the production increase and thrift plan, and basically ensured safe production. In terms of enterprise management, most of the grassroots cadres can grasp the various links in their work and cooperate in production. However, grassroots cadres mostly rely on experience to direct production and are not good at mastering scientific management methods, so disconnections often occur in production. The party organization and administrative leadership of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, as well as the working group sent by the National Committee of the Coal Mine Workers' Union of China, studied the above-mentioned situation and believed that the mine's goal for this year is to continue to improve safe production and reduce costs while ensuring output and quality; and to implement regular operations according to indicator charts in enterprise management.
    After the mine clarified its goals, the leadership went deep into grassroots organizations to vigorously mobilize the masses to strengthen the weak links in the above aspects.
    In the production cost of coal mines, the consumption of pit props accounts for the largest proportion. Therefore, the leadership decided to first help the prop group of Xin San Team of Wangfeng Mine to study how to reasonably use pit props. They adopted the methods of on-site testing, repeated explanations, and ideological education to promote the advanced experience of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. During the discussion, the masses came up with some new improvement methods. They also discussed and formulated many operation methods and regulations, and improved labor organization. After doing this, 60 pit props can be saved every day, and it can be guaranteed that no accidents will be caused by unqualified supports. The workers included these methods in the plan and immediately implemented them. As a result, the consumption of pit props in February was more than 100 million yuan lower than in January.
    The plan of the Xin San Team prop group was well-defined and achieved remarkable results; the leadership used this example to publicize education and promote other teams and groups, and the entire mine quickly set off an upsurge of finding solutions and learning advanced experience. At this time, the administration and the trade union jointly convened a rationalization proposal committee to promptly and carefully handle the solutions and suggestions put forward by the masses. The masses also immediately took action according to their plans. The workers of Xin San Team of the coal mining team fully realized their plans the next day after finalizing the plan. All three shifts completed their operations according to the plan and created a new record of 711 tons of daily output (the planned daily output was 600 tons). In the ten days of discussing the plan, the consumption of pit props in Xin Wu Team decreased by 30% compared with before, the consumption of explosives decreased by 20%, the efficiency increased by 7%, and no accidents occurred.
    In terms of safety work, there are more accidents in transportation. When discussing the safety production plan, the leadership first mobilized the masses to summarize the safety production experience in transportation over the past few years, and formulated three operating procedures for manual transportation, winch transportation, and endless rope transportation. Other types of work were also discussed and summarized separately, and safety regulations and systems were formulated for each type of work. At the same time, many problems were also solved in terms of safety equipment.
    In terms of enterprise management, the phenomenon of disconnection in production at that time was often due to the lack of close cooperation between shifts and various types of work, and the failure of management work to meet the requirements of production. Therefore, the leadership mobilized the masses to conduct detailed discussions on these issues and implemented regular operations. The workers welcomed this measure very much. They said, "With the implementation of regular operations, we don't have to ask when we arrive at the work surface every day to know what we should do. The tasks are clear, so it is easy to find ways to complete them." During the discussion, all types of work put forward their guarantees and measures, as well as requirements for relevant types of work and leadership.
    After the mass discussion ended, leaders at all levels began to review the plans formulated by the masses and the opinions put forward, and formulated their own plans accordingly. For example, after the masses of Xin San Team formulated the plan, the team leader Lian Quande immediately conducted research. All the problems that the workers could solve by themselves, he handed over to the workers to solve; the problems related to technical improvements were handed over to the technical personnel for research and processing; some problems needed to be resolved by the higher authorities, and he immediately submitted them to the higher authorities; all the things that he should do himself were arranged according to the importance and urgency, and he put forward the processing methods and included them in his work plan; at the same time, according to the opinions of the masses, he formulated a plan to improve the leadership methods. Then he announced this plan to the masses, asked the masses to discuss and offer opinions, and asked the masses to supervise and inspect the implementation of the leadership. The workers said, "The leaders have formulated a plan based on our opinions, and we are united from top to bottom, so our plan is guaranteed." Each production area also formulated the work plan for each area according to the requirements of the state and the plans of the workers. After these preparations were made, the leadership of the mining bureau decided to implement chart management after the plan discussion was over. Now, cadres and employees have begun to study the relevant aspects of chart management. (Ma Zhenchun)

    掌握主要环节发动群众找窍门
    焦作煤矿讨论生产计划结合改进计划管理
    焦作矿务局在发动群众讨论计划的工作中，根据本企业的生产情况，抓住降低成本、保证安全、改进计划管理三个主要环节，有领导地发动群众找窍门，提合理化建议，收到了比较显著的成绩。
    焦作煤矿的工作基础比较好，去年超额完成了增产节约计划，基本上保证了安全生产。在企业的管理方面，基层干部大多能够掌握工作中的各个环节，配合进行生产。但是，基层干部指挥生产大都只凭经验，还不善于掌握科学管理方法，因而生产中还常常发生脱节现象。焦作煤矿的党组织和行政领导方面以及中国煤矿工会全国委员会派去的工作组研究了上述这些情况，认为该矿今年的奋斗目标是继续改进安全生产和在保证产量质量的条件下降低成本；并在企业管理上实行按指示图表正规作业。
    该矿明确了努力方向之后，领导上便深入基层组织，大力发动群众，来加强上述各方面的薄弱环节。
    在煤矿生产成本中，坑木消耗占的比重最大。因此，领导方面便决定首先帮助王封矿新三队的支柱小组，研究如何合理使用坑木。他们采用了实地试验、反覆讲解和进行思想教育的办法，推广了峰峰矿务局的先进经验。在讨论过程中，群众又想出了一些新的改进办法。并且讨论制定了许多操作方法和规程制度，改进了劳动组织。这样做了之后，每天可以节省坑木六十根，并且可以保证不因支柱不合规格而引起任何事故。工人们把这些办法都列入了计划里，并且立即执行。结果二月份坑木消耗比一月份节约了一亿多元。
    采煤新三队支柱小组的计划定的比较好，取得了显著成绩；领导上就用这个例子来宣传教育，推动其他各队各组，全矿很快地掀起了找窍门学习先进经验的热潮。这时，行政和工会又共同召开了合理化建议委员会，及时地慎重地处理群众提出的窍门和建议。群众也都立即按照自己的计划行动起来。采煤新三队的工人在订好计划的第二天，就全部实现了自己的计划，三班工人都按计划完成了作业，创造了日产量七百一十一吨的新纪录（计划日产量为六百吨）。新五队在讨论计划的十天中，坑木消耗量比以前降低了百分之三十，炸药消耗量降低了百分之二十，效率提高百分之七，并且没有发生任何事故。
    在安全工作方面，以运输上的事故比较多。在讨论安全生产计划时，领导上便首先发动群众总结几年来在运搬方面的安全生产经验，订出了人力运搬、绞车道运搬和无极绳运搬三个操作规程。其他各工种也分别进行讨论总结，制定了各工种的安全规程和制度。同时在安全设备方面也解决了很多问题。
    在企业管理方面，当时生产中所以发生脱节现象，常是因为上下班和各工种间不能密切配合，和管理工作不能适应生产的要求。于是领导方面就发动群众针对这些问题进行了详细的讨论，实行了正规作业。工人们对这一措施非常欢迎。他们说：“实行了正规作业，每天到工作面上不用问就知道自己该干什么，任务明确，就好想办法完成。”在讨论中间，各工种都提出了自己的保证和措施，以及对有关工种和领导方面的要求。
    群众讨论结束之后，各级领导干部便开始审查群众制订的计划和提出的意见，据以定出自己的计划，如采煤新三队的大队长连全德在群众订好计划以后，马上进行研究，凡是工人自己能解决的问题，他就交给工人自己解决；有关技术改进的问题，则交给技术人员负责研究处理；有些问题需要上级解决，也立即提交上级；凡是应该他自己做的，都分别轻重缓急排好日程，提出处理办法列入自己的工作计划；同时根据群众的意见，订出了改进领导方法的计划。然后把这个计划向群众宣布，要求群众讨论提意见，并请群众监督和检查领导方面的执行情况。工人们都说：“领导干部根据我们的意见订了计划，上下一致了，我们的计划也就有了保证。”各个生产区也根据国家的要求和工人的计划拟定了各区的工作计划。进行了这些准备工作之后，矿务局领导上决定在讨论计划结束后就实行图表管理。现在，干部和职员已开始进行有关图表管理方面的学习。（马振春）
