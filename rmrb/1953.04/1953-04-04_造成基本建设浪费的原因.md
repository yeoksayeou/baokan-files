Reasons for Waste in Basic Construction
    Xu Binggeng, Director of the State-Owned Wusong Machine Factory

    The People's Daily criticized the Wusong Machine Factory on February 2nd for neglecting design and financial management, resulting in losses of state assets in basic construction. We fully accept the Party newspaper's criticism and, under the leadership of the Party Committee, have examined our basic construction work based on this criticism.

    In May 1951, the Wusong Machine Factory, due to production needs, was approved by higher authorities to build a heavy machinery workshop. However, because we mistakenly viewed basic construction as merely "building houses and buying machines" and did not give it due importance in our thinking, it resulted in huge losses. The heavy machinery workshop alone wasted 1.2 billion yuan, and the construction of family dormitories also lost more than 100 million yuan in design and management fees.

    The reasons for the above errors are, first of all, due to our tendency toward being grandiose and seeking quick success. When higher authorities considered building a heavy forging workshop in East China, we strived to have it built in our factory. After two pile-driving tests, construction was halted due to unsuitable geological conditions, but test-piling costs of more than 20 million yuan had already been wasted. When building the heavy machinery workshop, we were also greedy and blindly ordered batches of machinery and equipment from abroad. In 1951 and 1952, we placed a total of six orders, but most of the machines were not fully utilized. Currently, there are still eighteen idle machines, such as automatic lathes and crankshaft balancing machines. This tendency toward being grandiose is reflected in the design and construction work as blind recklessness. For example, the indoor crane for the heavy machinery workshop was initially decided to be 15 tons without thorough planning or consideration of product requirements. Later, it was deemed too large and changed to 10 tons, and finally to 4.5 tons, but the workshop's pile-driving and construction costs of up to 1 billion yuan had already been wasted. Another example is our decision to lay a cross-shaped transportation railway inside the workshop without calculating the actual amount of transport or how it would connect with other workshops. In addition, the tracks were laid too low, and they became ditches during rainfall, posing a risk of rainwater flowing into the underground cable trenches and causing electrical leakage. Although this error has been corrected, it has also wasted considerable assets.

    Secondly, we had a dependency mentality, believing that "design is the responsibility of the design company, construction is the responsibility of the East China Construction Company, and payment is the responsibility of the Bank of Communications." We thought we only needed to send a few people to make reports and urge construction progress. Therefore, we did not provide necessary information in the design phase, and we were careless and perfunctory in reviewing design drawings, resulting in a chaotic situation of modifying designs while constructing. For example, when making the underground cable trenches, it was originally planned to use a 1000-ampere power line, but in reality, only 500 amperes were sufficient. As a result, the previously made trenches were too large. Later, we felt that they took up too much production area and reduced their size, wasting a lot of money for nothing. Other examples include designing a circular roof, which resulted in the extra use of formwork and cement during construction; discovering there was no place to go when the overhead crane installation was completed; ... There are many similar examples of waste.

    Under the guidance of being grandiose and having a dependency mentality, the plans we made were not realistic. Omissions, inflated reports, and changes and modifications emerged endlessly, resulting in the phenomenon that every construction project had changes and additions or subtractions. This led to chaos in financial management. For example, when the construction of the forging workshop was first decided, we prepaid the construction company 3 billion yuan for material costs; later, when it was decided not to proceed, we did not promptly recover and hand over the funds. During the construction of the heavy machinery workshop, the project acceptance dragged on, and creditor's rights could not be handled for a long time. Because we did not pay attention to financial work, we even engaged in actions that violated financial discipline. For example, before the construction plan for the sheet metal workshop was approved, we used production funds to cover the construction costs.

    Because we did not study the higher authorities' instructions on basic construction, our understanding of basic construction was incorrect. Therefore, when the higher authorities approved the construction of the heavy machinery workshop, we did not establish a specialized agency or assign full-time cadres to be responsible for this work that is related to the country's long-term plan, which further increased the chaos in our work. In the future, we are determined to overcome the above shortcomings, earnestly implement the principle of "correct planning, correct design, correct construction," establish various systems, strengthen learning, and ensure that we carry out basic construction work correctly in the future.

    造成基本建设浪费的原因
    国营吴淞机器厂厂长  许炳庚
    二月二日人民日报批评了吴淞机器厂忽视设计和财务管理，在基本建设中使国家资财遭受了损失。我们完全接受党报的批评，并根据这一批评在党委的领导下，检查了基本建设工作。
    一九五一年五月，吴淞机器厂由于生产上的需要，经上级批准，建造重型机工场一座。但是由于我们错误地把基本建设看作仅仅是“盖盖房子，买买机器”，没有从思想上予以重视，因而造成了巨大损失，单是重型机工场，就浪费了十二亿元；家眷宿舍的建筑亦损失了设计与管理费一亿多元。
    产生以上错误的原因，首先是由于我们存在着好大喜功的思想。当上级考虑在华东建造一座重型锻工场时，我们就曾争取在我厂建设，后经二次试桩，发现地质不适合才停止建设，但已损失试桩费二千余万元。建设重型机工场时，我们也贪多好大，盲目地一批批地向国外订购机器设备，一九五一、一九五二年，先后共订了六次货，但大部分机器都没有充分运用，现在尚有自动车床、曲轴平衡机等十八台机器被闲置着。好大喜功的思想反映在设计与施工工作上就是盲目冒进，如重型机工场的室内行车，我们没有经过周密计划，也没有考虑产品的要求，就初步决定了十五吨，以后觉得太大了，又改为十吨，最后又改为四吨半，但已浪费了车间的打桩及建筑费达十亿元。又如我们决定在工场内铺设十字运输铁道，也没有计算究竟有多少运输量以及与其他工场如何沟通。加之轨道铺得太低，下雨时就变成水沟，雨水有流入电线地垅而发生走电的危险。这个错误虽已改正，但也浪费了不少的资财。
    其次，我们有依赖思想，认为“设计有设计公司，施工有华东建筑公司，付款有交通银行”，自己只要派几个人，做做表报，催催工就行了。因此，在设计上没有提供必要的资料，在审核设计图样时马虎草率，造成边施工边改设计的混乱现象。如做地垅时，原定用一千安培的动力线，但实际上只用五百安培的就够了，这样，原先做好的地垅就过大了。后来我们觉得它占去生产面积太大，又把它改小，白白损失了很多钱。其他如设计圆屋顶，使施工中多用了模板及水泥；架空行车的装设已经完成了才发现没有地方上去；……类似的造成浪费的例子还有不少。
    在好大喜功和依赖思想的指导下，订的计划就不踏实，漏列浮报、变更修改，层出不穷，形成建筑工程件件皆有更改，件件皆有增减的现象。从而在财务管理上也很混乱。例如当刚决定兴建锻工场时，就预付建筑公司材料费三十亿元；以后决定不做时，也没有及时收回上缴。在建设重型机工场时，工程验收拖拖拉拉，债权长期不能处理。由于我们不重视财务工作，甚至产生了违犯财政纪律的行为。如冷作工场的建设计划还没有批准，我们就用生产资金垫付了建造费。
    由于我们没有学习上级对基本建设的指示，我们对基本建设的认识是错误的，所以上级批准建设重型机工场时，我们也就没有设立专门机构，配备专职干部，来负责这项关系着国家百年大计的工作，这就更增加了工作中的混乱。今后我们决心克服以上缺点，切实贯彻“正确计划，正确设计，正确施工”的方针，建立各种制度，加强学习，保证今后正确地进行基本建设工作。
