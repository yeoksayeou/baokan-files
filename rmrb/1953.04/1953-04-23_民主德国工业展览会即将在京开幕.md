    The German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Foreign Trade Association of the German Democratic Republic and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, will open on April 27 at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. Preparations for the exhibition are now underway.
    This exhibition is the largest exhibition held abroad by the German Democratic Republic since its founding. In order to prepare for this exhibition, the German Democratic Republic sent the famous architectural professor, Comrade Semenakiq, to Beijing a year ago to inspect the site of the exhibition. After returning to his country, he actively carried out the design and preparation work for the exhibition. After March of this year, the German staff responsible for the design, installation, and layout of the exhibition, as well as the exhibits, began to arrive in Beijing successively. The staff includes famous professors, designers, technicians, art workers, and advanced workers from the German Democratic Republic. There are more than 1,300 boxes of exhibits in total, weighing more than 800 tons. These include large long-arm cranes, trucks, textile machines, printing presses, sawmills, precision instruments, physics experiment equipment, and electrical appliances. The heaviest exhibit weighs more than 19 tons, and the smallest weighs less than one kilogram. All the exhibits have now been transported to Beijing and will be ready for installation in the coming days.
    The purpose of this exhibition is to promote the friendship between the people of China and Germany and to help China's economic construction. The vast majority of the exhibits are orders from our country. During the installation of the exhibits, the excellent workers of the German Democratic Republic have taught our workers the technology and operating methods for installing the machines. They will also perform operations during the exhibition.

    民主德国工业展览会即将在京开幕
        【本报讯】德意志民主共和国对外贸易协会与中国国际贸易促进委员会联合主办的德意志民主共和国工业展览会，将于四月二十七日在北京市劳动人民文化宫开幕。现在展览会的筹备工作正在紧张地进行着。
    这次展览会是德意志民主共和国成立以来在国外举办的规模最大的展览会。德意志民主共和国方面为了筹备这次展览会，早在一年以前就派了著名的建筑学教授塞麦纳基克同志前来北京察看展览会的地址。他回国以后，就积极进行展览会的设计与筹备工作。今年三月以后，负责展览会的设计、安装与布置工作的德方工作人员与展览品就开始陆续到达北京。工作人员中包括民主德国著名的教授、设计师、技师、美术工作者与先进工人。全部展览品共有一千三百多箱，重达八百余吨。其中包括大型的长臂起重机、卡车、纺织机、印刷机、锯木机、精密器械、物理实验用具、电气用具等。最重的展览品重达十九吨多，最小的则不及一公斤。现在全部展览品都已运到北京，日内即可装置就绪。
    这次展览会的目的在于促进中德两国人民的友谊，并帮助我国的经济建设。展览品的绝大部分都是我国的订货。在安装展览品期间，民主德国的优秀工人已把安装机器的技术与操作方法教给了我国工人。在展览期内，他们还要进行操作表演。
