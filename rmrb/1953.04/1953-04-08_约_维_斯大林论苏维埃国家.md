J.V. Stalin on the Soviet State
USSR De Chesnokov

The experience of the Soviet state's existence over many years fully proves the principle of Marxism-Leninism: only with the help of its own state power (the dictatorship of the proletariat) can the working class revolutionize capitalist society and transform it into a communist society.

In summing up the world-historical experience of the Great October Socialist Revolution, J.V. Stalin pointed out that without the dictatorship of the proletariat, the revolution can defeat the bourgeoisie and overthrow its regime. However, it is only with the help of the socialist state, this special organ, that the resistance of the bourgeoisie can be suppressed, the fruits of victory consolidated, and progress made towards the final victory of socialism.

Comrade Stalin, together with V.I. Lenin, founded the Soviet state, which, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has grown into a powerful and invincible force.

V.I. Lenin's great achievement lies in his discovery that Soviet power is the best political form of the dictatorship of the working class. In developing V.I. Lenin's ideas about the Soviets, J.V. Stalin proved that the strength of the Soviets lies in the fact that they are all-encompassing mass organizations of the working people. Therefore, under the Soviet organizational system, the proletariat's leadership over the masses can be realized most easily and completely. The Soviets are the most powerful organs of revolutionary power and also the most democratic and prestigious mass organizations. One of the invaluable advantages of Soviet power is that it directly connects the working people with the state administrative organs.

Soviet power is a thoroughly internationalist state organization. It completely eliminates any national oppression and ensures close cooperation and unity of the working masses of different nationalities in a unified state alliance.

In revealing the characteristics and superiority of the Soviet form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Lenin and Stalin pointed out that the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat may be different due to specific historical conditions. J.V. Stalin elucidated the characteristics of the people's democratic system as a special form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Stalin defended Lenin’s principle that the alliance of the working class with the working peasantry is the supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointing out that this worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class and its party is the essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He revealed the leading role of the Communist Party in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat and emphasized that the party's leadership is paramount in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

J.V. Stalin provided a brilliant exposition of the three aspects of the dictatorship of the proletariat: using the proletarian regime to suppress the exploiters, defend the country, strengthen ties with the proletariat of other countries, and ensure the development and victory of revolutions in all countries; using the proletarian regime to completely liberate the working people and the oppressed masses from the bourgeoisie, consolidate the alliance of the proletariat with these masses, attract these masses to participate in the cause of socialist construction, and ensure the proletariat's state leadership over these masses; using the proletarian regime to organize the socialist system, eliminate classes, and transition to a classless society.

J.V. Stalin, following Lenin, taught that the dictatorship of the proletariat is not limited to state power organs. It is a system of mass organizations united and led by the Communist Party: trade unions, Soviets, youth leagues, cooperatives, and others.

The works of Lenin and Stalin comprehensively illustrate that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest form of democracy—proletarian democracy as opposed to bourgeois democracy. In the Soviet Union, Soviet socialist democracy has flourished on the basis of the victory of socialism, and the political activism of the working people has increased unprecedentedly. Therefore, the socialist state has become more consolidated and strengthened.

J.V. Stalin, in his report at the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets and in the Stalin Constitution, comprehensively pointed out the characteristics of the developed socialist Soviet democracy, pointing out its incomparable superiority over hypocritical bourgeois democracy.

In his historical report to the Eighteenth Party Congress, J.V. Stalin expounded the theory of the two stages in the development of the Soviet socialist state. He defined the first stage in the development of the Soviet state as the period from the October Revolution to the elimination of the exploiting classes. The basic tasks of our country during this period were to suppress the resistance of the overthrown classes, organize national defense to resist the aggression of interventionists, restore industry and agriculture, and prepare the conditions for eliminating capitalist elements. Thus, the Soviet state in this period fulfilled two basic functions: suppressing the resistance of the overthrown classes at home and organizing national defense against foreign aggression. There was also a third function at that time—the function of economic organization and cultural and educational work of our state organs. However, this new function did not receive significant development at that time.

The second stage in the development of the Soviet socialist state is the period from the elimination of capitalist elements in urban and rural areas to the complete victory of the socialist economic system and the adoption of the new Constitution of the Soviet Union. During this period, the state faced new tasks—organizing the socialist economy throughout the country, eliminating the last vestiges of capitalist elements, organizing the cultural revolution, and organizing a completely modern army to defend the country. All this changed the functions of the Soviet state: the function of domestic armed suppression disappeared and vanished because the exploiters had been eliminated. Replacing the function of armed suppression, the state appeared with the function of protecting socialist property and preventing theft of the people's wealth. The function of armed protection of the country against foreign aggression remained fully preserved, which means that the Soviet armed forces, punitive organs, and intelligence work were also preserved. The functions of economic organization and cultural and educational work remained preserved and were fully developed.

J.V. Stalin instructed: "Now, the basic tasks of our country internally are to carry out peaceful economic organization and cultural and educational work. As for our army, punitive organs, and detective agencies, their spearhead is no longer directed inward, but outward to deal with external enemies." (Moscow Chinese edition of "Problems of Leninism," p. 792)

J.V. Stalin paid special attention to the contrast between the domestic and foreign functions of the state. In his report to the Eighteenth Party Congress, he emphasized the danger of underestimating the role and significance of bourgeois states and their organs sending spies, murderers, and saboteurs into our country, explaining the significance of the Soviet socialist state, its armed forces, punitive organs, and intelligence agencies necessary to protect the country from foreign aggression.

J.V. Stalin tirelessly called for remembering the existence of the hostile capitalist encirclement, raising the vigilance of the Soviet people, and striving to consolidate the Soviet armed forces, punitive organs, and intelligence work.

J.V. Stalin said in 1930: "We are in favor of the state dying out. But at the same time, we are in favor of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is, until now, the most powerful of all state powers. The high development of state power is to prepare the conditions for the state power to die out—that is the Marxist formula. Is this a 'contradiction'? Yes, it is a 'contradiction.' But this contradiction is the contradiction of life, and it fully reflects Marx's dialectic." (Complete Works, Russian edition, Vol. 10, pp. 369-370)

Based on the experience of socialist countries, J.V. Stalin, for the first time in Marxist history, made the conclusion about the necessity of preserving the state even under communism, if the capitalist encirclement had not been eliminated by then, there would also be the task of striving to consolidate the socialist state.

J.V. Stalin, in his brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," emphasized with new force this idea, that is, regarding the situation where, with the existence of capitalist encirclement, the country where the revolution has triumphed "should not weaken its state, state organs, intelligence organs, army, but should strengthen them by all means, if this country does not want to be defeated by the capitalist encirclement." Following J.V. Stalin's brilliant instructions, the Communist Party has striven to consolidate and is consolidating the strength of the Soviet state, whose source of power and invincibility is the alliance of the working class and the collective farmers, the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet state is the primary tool for building a communist society and is an unbreakable fortress of peace in the world.

The Soviet state, in accordance with objective economic laws, achieves the uninterrupted growth of all social production, first of all the growth of the production of means of production, develops and improves socialist relations of production, it guarantees the continuous material and cultural growth of society, so that all members of society have the possibility of receiving education, becoming active activists in the development of society, and being able to freely choose their profession.

The Soviet state creates the necessary external political conditions for communist construction, defends the freedom and independence of our motherland, and consolidates the friendship with the great Chinese people, the people's democratic countries of Europe, and all peace-loving people. The Soviet state is waging a consistent and indomitable struggle for peace in the world.

The Communist Party is constantly improving all organs of the Soviet state, reorganizing them to adapt to the urgent tasks. In order to implement uninterrupted and correct leadership over all aspects of state life, and to ensure the smooth implementation of the domestic and foreign policies formulated by the Party and the government, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have adopted important resolutions. At its Fourth Session, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union gave legal effect to the resolutions of the joint plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which should be approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Organizational measures to improve state and economic leadership play an important role in further consolidating our great multinational socialist country and in consolidating the Soviet armed forces, which are responsible for ensuring the defense and security of the Soviet motherland.

These measures create the best conditions for further vigorously developing socialist industry and the collective farm economy, for expanding socialist cultural wealth, and for raising the material well-being of the working people.

The Soviet people have boundless trust in the Central Committee and the Soviet government. They know that the Communist Party and the Soviet government demonstrate the fundamental and vital interests of the people in all their domestic and foreign policies.

The powerful Soviet state, in the close unity of the Party, government, and people, and in the fraternal friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, is advancing victoriously along the road of communist construction. (Translated by Zhang Zifan from the March 18th Soviet "Pravda")

    约·维·斯大林论苏维埃国家
    苏联  德·车斯诺柯夫
    苏维埃国家存在的多年经验，完全证明了马克思列宁主义的原理：只有借助于自己的国家政权（无产阶级专政），工人阶级才能够把资本主义社会加以革命的改造，成为共产主义社会。
    在总结伟大十月社会主义革命的具有世界历史意义的经验时，约·维·斯大林指出：没有无产阶级专政，革命也能战胜资产阶级，推翻它的政权。可是却只有借助于社会主义国家这个特设机关，才能镇压资产阶级的反抗，巩固胜利果实，并向社会主义的最后胜利前进。
    斯大林同志和乌·依·列宁一起创立了苏维埃国家，这个国家在共产党领导下已成长为强大的、不可战胜的力量。
    乌·依·列宁的伟大功绩是在于他发现了苏维埃政权是工人阶级专政最好的政治形式。在发展乌·依·列宁关于苏维埃的思想时，约·维·斯大林证明了苏维埃的力量就在于它们是劳动人民的无所不包的群众组织，因此，在苏维埃组织制度之下，无产阶级对群众的领导，可以实现得最容易和最完整。苏维埃乃是革命政权最强有力的机关，同时也是最民主和最有威信的群众组织。苏维埃政权无可估量的优点之一，就是它直接把劳动人民和国家管理机关联结起来。
    苏维埃政权是彻底的国际主义的国家组织。它完全消灭任何民族压迫，并保证不同民族的劳动群众在统一的国家联盟中的紧密合作和团结。
    在揭示无产阶级专政的苏维埃形式的特点和优越性时，列宁和斯大林指出了无产阶级专政的形式，由于具体的历史条件而可以是不同的。约·维·斯大林阐明了作为无产阶级专政特殊形式的人民民主制度的特点。
    斯大林捍卫了关于工人阶级同劳动农民联盟是无产阶级专政最高原则这个列宁的原理，指出这种在工人阶级及其党领导下的工农联盟，是无产阶级专政的实质。他揭示出在无产阶级专政制度中，共产党的领导作用，并且着重指出了党的领导在无产阶级专政制度中是首要的。
    约·维·斯大林给无产阶级专政的三个方面提供了天才的论述：利用无产阶级政权镇压剥削者，保卫国家，加强与其他国家无产阶级的联系，保证世界各国革命的发展和胜利；利用无产阶级政权使劳动人民和被压迫的群众完全摆脱资产阶级，巩固无产阶级与这些群众的联盟，吸引这些群众参加社会主义建设的事业，保证无产阶级对这些群众实行国家领导；利用无产阶级政权组织社会主义制度，消灭阶级，过渡到没有阶级的社会。
    约·维·斯大林继列宁之后教导说，无产阶级专政不仅仅限于国家政权机关。它是由共产党所团结和领导的群众组织系统：职工会，苏维埃，青年团，合作社及其他。
    在列宁和斯大林的著作中全面说明了无产阶级专政是民主的最高形式——与资产阶级民主相对立的无产阶级民主。在苏联，苏维埃社会主义的民主在社会主义胜利的基础上兴盛起来了，劳动人民的政治积极性空前增高了，因此，社会主义国家就更加巩固和加强了。
    约·维·斯大林在非常第八次全苏联苏维埃代表大会上的报告中以及在斯大林宪法里，全面地指出了发达起来的社会主义的苏维埃的民主主义的特点，指出它较虚伪的资产阶级民主的无比优越性。
    约·维·斯大林在第十八次党代表大会上的历史性报告中，论证了关于苏维埃社会主义国家发展中两个阶段的学说。他确定了苏维埃国家发展中的第一个阶段是从十月革命起到消灭剥削者阶级为止的时期。我们国家在这个时期的基本任务是镇压已被推翻的阶级的反抗，组织国防以抵御干涉者的侵犯，恢复工业和农业，准备起消灭资本主义分子的条件。于是，苏维埃国家在这个时期就实现了两个基本职能：镇压国内已被推翻的阶级的反抗，组织国防以防外来的侵犯。当时还有第三个职能——我们国家各机关的经济组织工作和文化教育工作的职能。可是这个新职能当时没有得到重大的发展。
    苏维埃社会主义国家发展中的第二个阶段是从消灭城乡资本主义分子时起，到社会主义经济体系完全胜利和通过苏联新宪法为止的时期。在这个时期中在国家面前摆着新的任务——在全国组织社会主义经济，消灭资本主义分子最后的余孽，组织文化革命，组织保卫国家的完全现代式的军队。这一切就改变了苏维埃国家的职能：国内武力镇压的职能消失了，消亡了，因为剥削者已被消灭了。代替武力镇压职能的是国家出现了保护社会主义财富防范盗窃人民财富者的职能。武力保护国家以防外来侵犯的职能仍然是完全保存着，这就是说苏维埃武装力量、惩罚机关和侦察工作也还保存着。经济组织工作和文化教育工作的职能仍然保存着，并且得到了充分的发展。
    约·维·斯大林指示过：“现在，我们的国家在国内的基本任务，就是进行和平的经济组织工作和文化教育工作。至于我们的军队、惩罚机关和侦探机关，那末它们的锋芒已经不是向着国内，而是向着国外去对付外部敌人了。”（莫斯科中文版“列宁主义问题”七九二页）
    约·维·斯大林对国家的对内和对外职能的对比问题给以特别的注意。他在党的第十八次代表大会上的报告中，强调指出低估资产阶级国家及其机关派遣间谍、凶手和暗害分子到我们国家里来的那种作用和意义的危险性，说明了保护国家以防外来侵犯所必需的苏维埃社会主义国家、它的武装力量、惩罚机关和侦察机关的意义。
    约·维·斯大林不倦地号召记住敌对的资本主义包围的存在，提高苏维埃人的警惕性，并竭力巩固苏维埃武装力量、惩罚机关和侦察工作。
    约·维·斯大林在一九三○年说过：“我们是主张国家死亡的。但是我们同时又主张巩固无产阶级专政，这种专政是直到如今是许多国家政权中之最强有力的一个政权。国家政权的高度发展，为的是要准备条件，以便使国家政权死亡，——这就是马克思主义的公式。这是‘自相矛盾’吗？是的，这是‘自相矛盾’的。但这种矛盾，是生活的矛盾，这正完全反映着马克思的辩证法。”（俄文全集第十卷三六九至三七○页）
    根据综合社会主义国家的经验，约·维·斯大林在马克思主义历史中第一次做出了在共产主义下也保存国家的必要性的结论，假如到那时资本主义包围没有被消灭，也就有着竭力巩固社会主义国家的任务。
    约·维·斯大林在天才著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”中，以新的力量强调指出这个思想，即关于在资本主义包围存在下，革命胜利了的国家“不应当削弱自己的国家、国家机关、侦察机关、军队，而应当用一切办法加强它们，如果这个国家不愿意被资本主义的包围所击溃的话。” 遵循着约·维·斯大林的天才指示，共产党竭力巩固了并且正在巩固着苏维埃国家的实力，它的力量和不可战胜性的源泉就是工人阶级和集体农民的联盟、苏联各民族的友谊。
    苏维埃国家乃是建设共产主义社会的首要工具，是全世界牢不可破的和平堡垒。
    苏维埃国家按照客观经济法则来达到全部社会生产毫不间断的增长，首先是生产工具生产的增长，发展并改进社会主义的生产关系，它保证着社会不断的物质和文化的增长，以便使社会全体成员都有受教育、成为社会发展的积极活动家的可能，并能够自由选择职业。
    苏维埃国家为共产主义建设创造着必要的外部政治条件，保卫着我们祖国的自由和独立，巩固着与伟大的中国人民、欧洲人民民主国家以及一切爱好和平的人民的友谊。苏维埃国家为争取全世界的和平，进行着始终不渝的、不屈不挠的斗争。
    共产党不断地改进着苏维埃国家的一切机关，使它们改组得适应于迫切的任务。为了国家全部生活实行毫不间断的和正确的领导，为了保证党和政府所制定的对内和对外政策的顺利实施，目前苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团通过了重要的决议。苏联最高苏维埃在它的第四次会议上给予了应获得苏联最高苏维埃批准的、苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团全体联席会议的决议以法律上的效力。
    改善国家和经济领导方面的组织上的措施，在进一步巩固我们伟大的多民族社会主义国家，在巩固负有保证苏维埃祖国的防御和安全使命的苏维埃武装力量上，起着重要的作用。
    这些措施，为进一步全力发展社会主义工业和集体农庄经济，为扩大社会主义文化财富和提高劳动人民物质福利创造了最好的条件。
    苏维埃人对中央委员会和苏联政府抱着无限的信任。他们知道共产党和苏维埃政府在所有自己对内和对外政策中都表现出人民群众根本的切身利益。
    强大的苏维埃国家，在党、政府和人民的紧密团结中，在苏联一切民族兄弟般的友谊中，沿着共产主义建设的道路胜利前进。（张子凡译自三月十八日苏联“真理报”）
