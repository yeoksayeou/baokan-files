    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry, in deploying its work for the entire year, clearly pointed out that the factories and mines under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have achieved great successes in basic construction and production. At the same time, it proposed methods for correctly carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy and improving the level of industrial leadership in the industrial sector, so that basic construction and production tasks can be completed even better. This is equally applicable to other industrial sectors.
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry adopted the method of inspecting work, exposing and criticizing shortcomings and problems in its own work, and closely centering the anti-bureaucracy struggle around the current basic construction and production work. Starting from November of last year, they successively dispatched a large number of cadres, led by responsible cadres, to conduct in-depth and systematic inspections of the basic construction and production situations of their subordinate enterprises, exposed shortcomings in their work, analyzed the causes of shortcomings and errors, grasped the main links, found specific methods to overcome shortcomings and solve problems, and stipulated the steps for future work. This not only enabled the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry to have a clear understanding and take the initiative, but also enabled cadres in their subordinate enterprises to clearly recognize which key links they should grasp in their work in 1953, and how they should solve problems in their work. This has made it possible for them to overcome shortcomings and errors in their work and improve their level of industrial management. The experience of the Ministry of Heavy Industry tells us that hesitation, reluctance or unwillingness to carry out the anti-bureaucracy struggle, or detaching it from current basic construction and production work and carrying it out in isolation, are all wrong.
    Many serious shortcomings and problems exposed by the Ministry of Heavy Industry in its in-depth inspection of basic construction and production work are concentrated in the area of basic construction. These include failing to comprehensively and realistically consider actual needs and possible conditions; failing to proceed from the overall situation and only formulating basic construction plans blindly according to subjective desires and local needs, resulting in unrealistic and rash basic construction plans; failing to take active measures to strengthen design capabilities, and not daring to boldly expose and criticize erroneous design ideas, resulting in designs lagging far behind construction requirements, or causing erroneous and wasteful designs; the existence of alarming waste and lack of responsibility in construction; and the generally poor quality of projects. In production, there are serious conservative ideas when formulating plans, failing to tap the potential strengths and favorable factors of enterprises, with production quotas being conservative and lagging behind reality; failure to balance production when implementing plans, with output fluctuating greatly, causing chaos in production; the generally poor quality of products, with many rejects and substandard products; and failure to pay attention to safety work, resulting in frequent accidents. Obviously, the existence of these shortcomings and problems has caused enormous losses to the country, and at the same time, it has created serious obstacles on our road to socialist industrialization.
    The shortcomings and problems that exist in the basic construction and production of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry are also generally present in state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises across the country, and may be even more serious in some units. At present, some departments appear to be "calm" on the surface, with everything proceeding "smoothly"; but this does not mean that there are no shortcomings and problems in those departments. Therefore, all industrial departments should, like the Ministry of Heavy Industry, not only expose shortcomings and problems in their own work, but also conduct in-depth analysis and research on the shortcomings and problems that have been exposed, grasp the main problems and central links, and not grasp everything indiscriminately. This will ensure that the focus of our anti-bureaucracy struggle is directed at the main shortcomings and errors in our current work, and that we solve the main problems. Once the main problems are solved, the secondary problems will be easily solved.
    Based on the current state of work and the existing problems, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has specifically stipulated the main tasks for 1953. In terms of basic construction, they will focus on studying the construction conditions of new and expanded factories and mines in all aspects, reviewing quotas, arranging project schedules, and balancing the workload year by year, in order to improve basic construction planning and ensure that basic construction plans are based on reliable foundations; strengthening survey and design institutions, criticizing erroneous bourgeois design ideas, establishing overall design ideas, economic accounting perspectives, learning advanced technology from the Soviet Union, and paying attention to the welfare of workers and staff in design work, in order to strengthen survey and design capabilities and improve design levels; opposing alarming waste and lack of responsibility in construction, conducting quality inspections, implementing economic accounting, and summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, in order to improve basic construction work. In terms of production, they will mobilize the masses in various factories and mines to discuss this year's production plans from March to April, promoting positive factors and overcoming conservative views; from May to August, they will carry out the struggle against lack of responsibility, establishing various responsibility systems in factories and mines, and completing production tasks in a balanced manner on the basis of the responsibility system; after August, they will conduct mass quality inspections to improve technical management.
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry's deployment of work for 1953, although it may differ in specific practices for other industrial departments, will be generally the same in terms of the main links and steps of work to be carried out in 1953. Each industrial department should also, like the Ministry of Heavy Industry, proceed from its own current work situation and, based on the overall plan, make a general arrangement for the main tasks to be carried out by its subordinate enterprises within the year, in order to improve basic construction and production work purposefully and orderly, overcome shortcomings, improve leadership levels, and better complete the national plan. Party and government leading organs at all levels should ensure that Party affairs work and political work revolve around the main tasks of the enterprise, in order to ensure the completion of the national plan.
    Since this year's basic construction tasks are extremely heavy, and the past preparations have been insufficient, and current technical conditions are also limited, resource exploration, engineering geology, design work, equipment ordering, material preparation, and the organization of construction forces cannot be well coordinated and matched, resulting in idle work and temporary rushes. In order to change this situation, the leading organs of various industrial departments, major regions, and important industrial cities should place basic construction in a more important position, strengthen leadership over this work, grasp the key construction projects, arrange project schedules, organize the forces of all parties to work in a balanced manner, and strictly check the quality of design and construction, and take timely and concrete effective solutions based on the problems found to ensure the smooth completion of basic construction tasks and avoid and reduce possible waste.
    The management of industrial and mining enterprises is extremely complex. As the Ministry of Heavy Industry pointed out in its instructions to subordinate enterprises, there are many aspects of confusion in enterprise management at present, and any work or department cannot withstand inspection. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp one or several main tasks in a planned and step-by-step manner over a certain period of time, concentrate efforts to make a relatively in-depth understanding and a relatively thorough solution, in order to gradually change the face of work.

### 正确地开展工业部门的反官僚主义斗争

    正确地开展工业部门的反官僚主义斗争
    中央人民政府重工业部在部署全年工作中，明确地指出重工业部所属各厂矿在基本建设和生产方面已经取得了巨大成绩。同时提出了在工业部门中正确地开展反对官僚主义的斗争、提高工业的领导水平的方法，使基本建设和生产任务能够完成得更好。这对于其他工业部门同样是适用的。
    重工业部采取检查工作、揭露和批判自己工作中缺点和问题的方法，紧紧地围绕着当前基本建设和生产工作去进行反官僚主义的斗争。他们从去年十一月开始，陆续派遣大批干部，由负责干部带领，深入地、系统地检查了所属企业单位的基本建设情况和生产情况，揭发了工作中的缺点，分析了产生缺点和错误的原因，抓住了主要环节，找出了克服缺点和解决问题的具体办法，规定了今后工作的步骤。这样，不仅使重工业部的领导方面做到了心中有数，取得了主动，而且使其所属各个企业中的干部明确认识了自己在一九五三年工作中应该抓住那些主要环节，应该如何去解决工作中的问题。这就使他们有可能去克服工作中的缺点和错误，提高管理工业的水平。重工业部的经验告诉我们，犹疑不决，不敢或不愿开展反官僚主义斗争，或者是脱离当前基本建设和生产工作，孤立地去开展反官僚主义斗争，都是错误的。
    重工业部在深入检查基本建设和生产工作中所揭发出来的许多严重的缺点和问题，集中表现在基本建设方面，不全面和切实地考虑实际需要和可能的条件，不从全局出发，只按照主观愿望和局部需要，盲目制订基本建设的计划，使基本建设计划成为不切实际的冒进计划；不采取积极措施壮大设计力量，不敢大胆揭发和批判错误的设计思想，以致造成设计大大落后于施工的要求，或者造成错误的和浪费的设计；施工中存在着惊人的浪费现象和无人负责现象，工程质量普遍低劣。在生产中，制订计划时有严重的保守思想，不能发挥企业的潜在力量和有利因素，生产定额是保守的，落后于实际；在执行计划时不能均衡生产，产量忽高忽低，造成生产上的混乱；产品质量普遍不好，废品、次品很多；不注意保安工作，时常发生意外事故。显然，这些缺点和问题的存在，给国家带来的损失是异常巨大的，它同时造成了我们向社会主义工业化前进道路上的严重障碍。
    重工业部所属企业在基本建设和生产中存在的缺点和问题，在全国国营和地方国营工矿企业中，同样是普遍存在着的，有些单位可能还更为严重。目前有一些部门，在工作的表面上看来好像“平静无事”，一切都进行得很“顺利”；但这并不是说明他们那里已经没有缺点和问题存在。因此，一切工业部门，都应该像重工业部那样，不仅要揭发自己工作中的缺点和问题，而且必须对已经暴露的缺点和问题进行深刻的分析研究，抓住主要问题和中心环节，而不应该不分主次地乱抓一通。这样才能使我们反官僚主义斗争的锋芒针对目前工作中存在的主要缺点和错误，解决主要问题。主要问题解决了，次要的问题也就容易得到解决。
    重工业部根据目前工作的状况和存在的问题，具体规定了一九五三年的主要工作。在基本建设方面，他们要着重研究新建及扩建厂矿各方面的建设条件，审核定额，排列工程进度及平衡逐年的工作量，以改进基本建设的计划工作，使基本建设的计划建立在确实可靠的基础上；增强勘察、设计机构，批判错误的资产阶级的设计思想，确立设计工作中的总体设计思想、经济核算观点、向苏联学习先进技术及注意职工福利的观点，以壮大勘察、设计力量和提高设计水平；在施工中反对惊人浪费现象和无人负责现象，进行质量检查，实行经济核算，总结和推广先进经验，以改进基本建设的施工工作。在生产方面，他们要在三月至四月发动各厂矿群众讨论今年生产计划，发扬积极因素，克服保守观点；五月至八月，要进行反对无人负责现象的斗争，建立厂矿中的各种责任制度，并在责任制的基础上均衡地完成生产任务；八月以后进行群众性的质量检查，提高技术管理。
    重工业部关于一九五三年工作的部署，对于其他工业部门说来，虽在具体做法上可能有所不同，但在一九五三年工作的主要环节和进行的步骤上大体是会相同的。各工业部门也应该像重工业部那样，从自己的工作现状出发，根据总的计划，对所属企业在一年内所要进行的主要工作做一个大体的安排，以便目的明确地和有秩序地去改进基本建设和生产工作，克服缺点，提高领导水平，更好地完成国家的计划。地方各级党政领导机关，应该使党务工作和政治工作围绕着企业的主要工作去进行，以保证国家计划的完成。
    由于今年的基本建设任务极其繁重，而过去的准备工作又很不够，目前技术条件也有限制，因此在资源勘察、工程地质、设计工作、设备订购、材料准备及施工力量组织等方面都还不能很好地衔接和配合，以致发生窝工和临时突击的现象。为了改变这种情况，各工业部门和各大区及重要工业城市的领导机关，应把基本建设放在更为重要的地位，加强对这一工作的领导，抓住建设重点，排好工程进度，组织各方面的力量均衡地工作，同时要严格检查设计和施工的质量，并根据检查出的问题，及时地和具体地采取有效的解决办法，保证基本建设任务的顺利完成，避免和减少可能产生的浪费现象。
    工矿企业的管理工作是极其繁杂的，正如重工业部向所属企业单位所发布的指示中所指出的，目前企业管理中存在着许多方面的混乱现象，任何工作、任何部门都还经不起检查，因此，就需要有计划有步骤地在一定时期抓住一项或几项主要工作，集中力量作比较深入的了解和比较彻底的解决，才能逐步改变工作的面貌。
