Where is the Secret to Increasing Production?
The Junan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Farmers Need Ways to Increase Production
In recent years, farmers in Guandi Village, Junan County, Shandong Province, have improved their farming techniques and increased fertilizer application compared to the past. Previously, they only plowed four finger-widths deep, now they plow seven; previously, they applied two to three cartloads of fertilizer per mu, now they apply four to five. In February of this year, the village farmers launched a patriotic production increase campaign. By March 9th, mutual aid teams had plowed two-thirds of the spring land, and plowed one finger-width deeper than last year; the harrowing was thorough and fine; however, the masses felt that this year's farming techniques had not improved much compared to last year, and they lacked confidence in further increasing yields. Wu Duansheng, the head of a mutual aid team, said, "Several years ago, I responded to the call of the higher authorities to plow deeply, cultivate meticulously, and apply more fertilizer, and yields have already increased considerably. In the past, one mu of sorghum yielded 145 jin, now it can yield about 200 jin. The higher authorities are still calling for increases, how is that possible?"

Calculating Carefully Reveals the Path to Increased Production
In order to find the path to increased production, the Guandi Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party, with the specific help of the county committee work team, studied the new experiences of the Zhaoyuan agricultural production increase movement in Northeast China, and decided to check the number of plants per mu, calculate the weight of the seed heads, and estimate the possibility of increasing production.

On March 10th, it rained and the land could not be plowed. The branch took this opportunity to convene an expanded branch committee meeting. At the meeting, everyone calculated that according to the village's planting habits, sorghum rows are generally one chi two cun (市尺) wide, with plant spacing of one chi five cun, totaling more than 3,300 plants per mu. Slightly denser planting can reach about 3,500 plants. Branch committee member Ju Fengtian weighed an average seed head, which weighed two liang. If calculated at 3,300 plants, the yield could reach 412.5 jin. This is the true normal yield. However, the village's average yield is only 170-180 jin. According to the new calculation method, each mu yields more than 200 jin less grain. Branch committee member Wu Licheng said, "I also calculated this last year. There were enough seedlings, more than 3,000 plants. It should have yielded more than 400 jin, but I only harvested 220 jin. I really don't know what happened. It's a pity that I didn't count how many plants there were when I cut the sorghum." After he said this, everyone became aware that the problem was too few seedlings. Everyone calculated Wu Licheng's two mu of sorghum. Each mu had more than 300 plants eaten by mole crickets, more than 500 plants broken off by cutworms and then blown down by the wind, 150-160 plants were diseased, and including seedlings damaged by hoeing, a total of more than 1,200 plants were lost. In the end, only more than 1,800 plants remained. Calculated at two liang of grain per seed head, that's exactly more than 220 jin.

The result of the discussion was that if you want to harvest more grain, the first step is to strive for full and complete seedlings. Some said, "We only talk about deep plowing, careful cultivation, and more fertilizer, but if there are only more than 1,000 seedlings left in the ground, it's impossible to harvest more grain." At this time, everyone believed that to strive for complete seedlings, it is necessary to first study methods to overcome the phenomenon of missing seedlings.

Launch a Seedling Protection and Complete Seedling Campaign
After the branch committee came up with methods to overcome the phenomenon of missing seedlings, the branch prepared to launch a seedling protection campaign before spring planting to ensure the realization of this year's production increase plan. On the evenings of March 11th and 12th, branch committee members helped five mutual aid teams calculate carefully and formulated specific spring planting and seedling protection plans. On the evening of the 13th, a meeting of all 33 mutual aid team leaders, propaganda officers, and technicians was convened. Five model teams introduced methods for increasing production. Wu Benlan, the head of a mutual aid team, first introduced that their team, after calculating the number of plants and weighing the seed heads, realized that last year, due to pests and diseases, wind disasters, rough cultivation, and inattention to seedling protection, each mu yielded 100-200 jin less grain than the normal yield. Then, she introduced her team's methods for striving to increase production this year, saying: "In addition to implementing the original deep plowing, careful harrowing, and rational fertilization plan, we are also determined to overcome the past phenomenon of inattention to seedling protection. This year, seedling protection and complete seedling work will be the specific content of the spring planting competition plan. It's almost time to plant, we must handle the seeds well, do a good job of selecting seeds and disinfecting them to prevent diseases. Use millet mixed with arsenic to prevent mole crickets. When hoeing the first time, space the seedlings evenly, break the old habit of leaving sparse seedlings thick and thick seedlings sparse, and not transplanting seedlings, transplant and replant seedlings in a timely manner; also remove cutworms, catch moths, and catch corn borers to ensure complete seedlings. Pay attention to earthing up when hoeing the third time to prevent wind and waterlogging." Wu Zengcheng's mutual aid team specifically raised the issue of improving the technique of sowing and hoeing, he said: "In the past, when sowing, there were no seeds every three or two steps, and they still said it wasn't sparse, and it was easy to hoe. As long as the rows are straight, that's good skill. This year, our team will not only sow straight, but more importantly, sow more seeds to ensure even emergence. Only in this way can even spacing of seedlings be guaranteed. When hoeing, we must leave seedlings according to size, ensuring that we leave more than 3,300 plants, and that the distance between plants is the same. In the past, hoeing was done quickly, often damaging the roots or hoeing away seedlings; in the future, hoeing must be meticulous, ensuring that no seedlings are damaged. Weeds next to the seedling roots must be pulled out by hand." Each model team introduced methods for protecting seedlings and ensuring complete seedlings as content for the competition. These methods, when concentrated, became systematic and comprehensive. In group discussions, everyone reflected that with more people, there are more methods, and they have confidence in increasing production. Everyone also raised problems and methods that the above five teams had not thought of. Some proposed that only protecting seedlings and ensuring complete seedlings, with seedlings of uneven size, cannot guarantee increased production. It is necessary to use urine and fertilizer powder to boost the seedlings at any time, so that small seedlings catch up with the large ones. Through discussion, everyone planned to make seedling protection plans and revise their annual production increase plans in their teams. Under the influence of the mutual challenges of these five teams, a new patriotic production increase campaign was launched in Guandi Village.

    增产的窍门在那里
    中共莒南县委员会
    农民需要增产办法
    几年来，山东省莒南县官地村的农民，在耕作技术和施肥量方面，都比以前提高了。过去只耕四指深，现在已耕到七指；过去每亩地施肥二至三车，现在已到四至五车。今年二月间，该村农民开展了爱国增产竞赛运动，各互助组到三月九日，已耕完春地三分之二，并且比去年深耕一指；耙的又透又细；可是，群众总觉得今年的耕作技术比去年改进不多，对进一步提高产量并没有信心。互助组长吴端升说：“好几年前我就响应上级的号召，深耕细作，多施肥，产量已经提高了不少，过去一亩高粱收一百四十五斤，现在能收到二百斤左右，上级还叫提高，怎样能呢？”
        算细账摸着了增产的门路
    为了寻找增产的门路，中共官地村支部在县委工作组的具体帮助下，研究了东北肇源农业增产运动的新经验，决定查每亩地作物的棵数，计算穗头的重量，估算增产的可能性。
    三月十日，天下雨，不能耕地，支部乘着这个机会召开了扩大支委会议。大家在会上计算，按本村种地的习惯，高粱一般垅宽一尺二寸（市尺），株距一尺五寸，每亩合三千三百多棵。稍密的可到三千五百棵左右。支部委员鞠凤田秤了一个中等穗子的籽粒，有二两重，如按三千三百棵计算，就能收四百一十二斤半。这是真正的常年应产量。但是全村普遍收成仅一百七、八十斤，按新的计算方法看来，每亩地少收二百多斤粮食。支部委员吴立成说：“我在去年也算过这个账，留苗足够三千多棵，按说能收四百多斤，可是只收了二百二十斤。我到底不知是怎么一回事。可惜我砍高粱时，就没有数一数究竟有多少棵。”经他这一说，大家都清醒了，一致认为是苗子少了。大家拿吴立成的二亩高粱计算了一下，每亩被蝼蛄吃了三百多棵，被截虫截了以后又被风刮断五百多棵，生病的有一百五六十棵，连锄坏了的苗子，总共损失一千二百多棵，最后只剩下一千八百多棵。要按一个穗头的籽粒二两重计算，正好是二百二十多斤。
    大家讨论的结果，认为要想多打粮食，第一步就要争取满苗、全苗。有的说：“光说深耕细作，多上粪，可是地里只剩一千多棵苗子，无论如何不能多打粮食。”这时，大家认为要想争取全苗，就必须首先研究出克服缺苗现象的办法。
        展开保苗、全苗竞赛运动
    在支委会上想出克服缺苗现象的办法以后，支部便准备在春种前开展一个保苗运动，以保证今年增产计划的实现。支部委员们在三月十一、十二两个晚上，分头帮助五个互助组算细账，订出了具体的春种保苗计划。十三日晚上又召开了全村三十三个互助组长、各组宣传员、技术员会议。由五个典型组介绍增产办法。互助组长吴本兰首先介绍他们组里经过算棵数、秤穗头，弄明白去年因为病虫害、风灾、耕作粗放和不注意保苗，以致每亩比常年产量少收一、二百斤粮食的情况，接着介绍他组里今年争取增产的办法说：“我们除了按原先定的深耕细耙、合理施肥的计划实行以外，还决心克服以往不注意保苗的现象。今年要把保苗、全苗工作，做为春种竞赛计划的具体内容。现在快下种了，要处理好种籽，作好选种和种籽消毒工作来防除病害。用小米拌信石的方法防蝼蛄。锄头遍地时，要等距间苗，打破稀苗留稠、稠苗留稀和不移苗的老习惯，及时移苗、补苗；还要除土蚕，捕蛾子，捉钻心虫保证全苗。锄三遍地时注意培土，防风、防涝。”吴增成互助组特别提出提高耩地、锄地的技术问题，他说：“过去耩地时，三步两步没个种，还说不稀，锄地好锄。只要耩的垅直，就是好本事。今年我们组不但要耩的直，更重要的是多下种，作到出苗匀。只有这样，等距间苗才能有保证。锄地时候，一定要按尺寸留苗，保证留三千三百棵以上，并使棵与棵的距离要一样远。过去锄田图快，经常把根伤了，或锄掉苗子；以后锄地要细致，保证不损一棵苗。苗根旁的草一律用手拔。”各个典型组都介绍了保苗全苗的办法，作为竞赛的内容，这些办法集中起来，就系统、全面了。在分组讨论中，大家纷纷反映：人多办法多，增产有信心。大家并提出了以上五个组所没有想到的问题和办法。有的提出：光保苗、全苗，苗子大小不齐也不能保证增产，必须随时用尿、肥田粉提苗，使小苗赶上大的。通过讨论，大家都打算到组里订保苗计划，修订全年增产计划。在这五个组的互相挑战影响下，新的爱国增产竞赛运动，就在官地村展开了。
