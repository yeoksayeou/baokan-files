Spring ploughing production has fully unfolded in Guangdong and Henan provinces. In Guangdong Province, except for the northern regions, rice seedling sowing has been generally completed. In Hainan Island, rice transplanting has been completed, and early-transplanted rice is beginning to bud or spike. Before and after the start of spring ploughing production, farmers in various places have paid close attention to accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, and deep ploughing and meticulous cultivation. Su'nan District in Chenghai County, which has always relied on commercial fertilizers, has accumulated 1.06 million dan of manure and other fertilizers this spring. Li farmers in Buchan Township, Ledong County, Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, collected more than 337,000 dan of pig and cattle manure in one month. They have also changed the past practice of rough farming, with rice fields generally ploughed and harrowed three times, and sandy fields ploughed twice and harrowed once. More than 26,000 small-scale water conservancy projects have been repaired throughout the province, benefiting more than 1.3 million mu of farmland. In order to specifically lead spring ploughing production, agricultural production work conferences have been held in counties, districts, and townships. The Yuexi Administrative Office also organized spring ploughing inspection groups to go deep into districts and townships for key inspections and supervision. Currently, under the leadership of labor models, farmers are launching patriotic production increase campaigns.

Spring ploughing production in Henan Province has entered a tense stage. The wheat seedlings on more than 73 million mu of wheat fields across the province are already four to five inches high. In addition to actively irrigating the wheat fields, farmers in areas with the habit of hoeing wheat have hoeed once or twice, and most areas have applied topdressing fertilizer. Goushu, Yongcheng, and other counties have generally applied 1,500 to 3,000 jin of fertilizer to wheat fields this year. In Qinyang County, topdressing fertilizer has been applied to 70% of the total wheat field area. At a time when wheat seedlings are growing vigorously, many wheat fields have been infested with red spiders, wireworms, and other pests, and are threatened by lurking wheat midges. After the Henan Provincial People's Government issued an emergency directive on pest control, farmers in various places are organizing forces to eliminate pests to ensure a good wheat harvest this year. More than 46 million mu of winter fallow land across the province has been generally ploughed and harrowed once, and 70% has been fertilized. Farmers have selected and exchanged improved varieties, purchased pesticides for seed soaking and mixing, and actively learned advanced experience such as close planting through technical dissemination stations or other organizational forms, and will soon begin sowing. In addition, the patriotic production competition initiated at the Henan Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference at the end of February and the beginning of March has gradually unfolded throughout the province.

The Chinese Communist Party Fujian Provincial Committee and the Fujian Provincial People's Government have strengthened leadership over spring ploughing production. From late February to mid-March, Shi Lin, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, led more than 20 cadres to the Longxi, Jinjiang, and Minhou special districts, where spring ploughing started earlier. Jiang Yizhen, Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee, Lu Yinbo, Deputy Director, Wang Jingqun, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, and others led more than 80 cadres to various special districts to inspect spring ploughing production or convey the provincial party committee's instructions on spring ploughing production, and help solve difficulties in spring ploughing production and other work. At the same time, the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee dispatched cadres to Longyan, Sha County, and Minhou counties according to the different characteristics of old revolutionary base areas, mountain forest specialty areas, and agriculture-based areas. The Rural Work Department of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee and the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also established base areas and base townships in Minhou County to directly grasp spring ploughing production in these areas, so as to learn experience and guide the work in other areas. In addition, the Party and government leading organs of the Nanping, Fu'an, Jinjiang, and Minhou special districts and many counties have also sent inspection teams or working groups led by responsible cadres to the countryside to guide and assist district and township cadres in leading farmers' spring ploughing production.

    广东河南两省春耕生产全面展开
    中共福建省委和省人民政府派干部到各地指导生产
    广东省春耕生产已全面展开。全省除北部地区外，已普遍完成播种水稻秧苗，海南岛并已完成插秧，早插的稻禾正开始孕穗或抽穗。各地农民在春耕生产开始前后，都很注意积肥、兴修水利和深耕细作。一向依靠商品肥料的澄海县苏南区，今春也已积粪肥等一百零六万担。海南黎族苗族自治区乐东县布产乡黎族农民，一个月中就拾猪粪、牛粪等三十三万七千多担；他们并改变了过去耕作粗放的习惯，稻田一般做到三犁三耙，沙田也做到二犁一耙。全省修好的小型水利有二万六千余处，受益农田达一百三十多万亩。为了具体领导春耕生产，各县、区、乡都先后召开农业生产工作会议。粤西行署还组织了春耕检查团，有重点地深入区乡检查督促。目前，各地农民群众在劳动模范的带头下，已展开爱国增产竞赛运动。
    河南省春耕生产已进入紧张阶段。全省七千三百多万亩麦田，麦苗已有四五寸高。农民们除积极在麦田进行灌溉外，有锄麦习惯的地区已锄过一遍到两遍，大部地区并施了追肥。谷熟、永城等县今年麦田普遍施肥一千五百斤到三千斤。沁阳县施追肥的麦田占全县麦田总面积百分之七十。目前正当麦苗蓬勃生长的时候，不少麦田发生了红蜘蛛、金针虫等虫害，并受到潜伏着的吸浆虫的威胁。河南省人民政府发出治虫的紧急指示后，各地农民正在组织力量，扑灭虫害，以保证今年小麦丰收。全省四千六百多万亩冬季休闲地，已经普遍犁、耙一遍，并已有百分之七十施肥完毕。农民们都选换了良种，购买了杀虫药剂作浸种拌种之用，并纷纷利用技术传授站或其他组织形式，积极学习密植等先进经验，不久就要开始播种。此外，在二月底到三月初河南省农业劳动模范代表会议上发起的爱国生产竞赛，已在全省逐渐展开。
    中国共产党福建省委员会和福建省人民政府已加强对春耕生产的领导。从二月下旬到三月中旬，福建省人民政府农林厅副厅长石林率领二十多个干部到春耕开始较早的龙溪、晋江、闽侯三个专区，中共福建省委员会农村工作部部长江一真、副部长吕尹波、青年团福建省工作委员会书记王敬群等率领八十多个干部分别到各专区，检查春耕生产或传达省委关于春耕生产的指示，并帮助解决春耕生产及其他工作中的困难问题。同时，中共福建省委员会按照革命老根据地、山林特产地区和以农业为主的地区等不同特点，对龙岩、沙县、闽侯三县专门派出干部；中共福建省委员会农村工作部和福建省人民政府农林厅等也都在闽侯县建立基点区和基点乡，直接掌握这些地区的春耕生产，以便吸取经验，指导其他地区工作。此外，南平、福安、晋江、闽侯四个专区和许多县的党、政领导机关，也纷纷派出由负责干部率领的检查组或工作组下乡，指导和协助区、乡干部领导农民春耕生产。（新华社）
