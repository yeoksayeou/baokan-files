	Strictly Prohibit the Practice of Randomly "Struggling Against" and "Rectifying" Students
	Judging from the incidents that occurred at the Fengfeng Mining Area Industrial School in Hebei and the materials reflected in local newspapers and readers' letters, there still exists an entirely unacceptable situation in our school education work. That is, many school leaders and teachers completely disregard the physiological and psychological characteristics of young students when dealing with the misdeeds, shortcomings, or ideological problems of young students. Some set up "backward associations" or run "backward student training classes" for so-called "backward students"; some randomly label students, recklessly "struggle against" and "rectify" them; and even detain, interrogate, and beat them. These extremely erroneous practices and illegal and undisciplined behaviors have severely damaged the physical and mental health of young students, causing great losses to our country's work of cultivating talent for construction.
	This must be thoroughly corrected and strictly prohibited. Because this practice of recklessly "struggling against" and "rectifying" students is completely contrary to the spirit and policies of education of our Party and the People's Government for the younger generation.
	According to the educational policies of the Party and the People's Government, schools should adopt a benevolent, caring, and protective attitude when dealing with students' misdeeds, shortcomings, or ideological problems. That is to say, adopt educational methods of patient persuasion, enlightened self-awareness, and encouragement and guidance, and through a series of positive, active, long-term, and meticulous classroom education and extracurricular activities, effectively correct their shortcomings and mistakes. Because young people are in the process of growing up, their character can be completely shaped, and the key is what methods we use to effectively influence their psychological and moral outlook in a certain direction. Education is an extremely complex ideological work. The formation of correct thinking and noble behavior in a young person can never achieve the desired purpose by using any simple, rigid, crude, or barbaric means.
	However, some school leaders and teachers completely fail to understand these principles. They adopt various egregious methods, and even mistakenly use methods of treating counter-revolutionaries to treat students. This has seriously undermined the educational policies of the Party and the People's Government.
	As for the leaders of the Fengfeng Mining Area Industrial School, it should be said that it does not stop there. Judging from the series of mistakes they have committed, they not only illegally "struggle against" students, suppress criticism, suppress democracy, and regard the school as their own "independent kingdom," but they have also developed to the point of resisting inspections by higher-level Party committees and governments. It must be pointed out that all their behaviors are inseparable from their long-term illegal and undisciplined behavior, and also inseparable from the bureaucraticism of the relevant higher-level Party committees.
	The propaganda departments and educational leading organs of various localities must pay close attention to this situation. Because in our school education work, if this erroneous practice of recklessly "struggling against" and "rectifying" students and illegal and undisciplined behavior are not strictly prohibited and thoroughly corrected, it will inevitably cause greater damage to the educational policies of the Party and the People's Government, and bring even greater losses to the country's work of cultivating talent for construction.

    严禁乱“整”乱“斗”学生的作法
    从河北峰峰矿区工业学校所发生的事件和各地报纸、读者来信所反映的材料来看，在我们的学校教育工作中，还存在着一种完全不能令人容忍的状况。那便是有不少的学校领导人员和教师，在处理青年学生行为上的过失、缺点或思想问题时，完全无视青年学生的生理特点和心理特点。他们有的为所谓“落后学生”成立“落后会”，或者开办“落后学生训练班”；有的给学生乱扣帽子，胡“整”乱“斗”；甚至加以扣押、审讯、吊打。这些极端错误的作法和违法乱纪行为，严重地摧残了青年学生的身心健康，使我们国家培养建设人材的工作遭到了很大的损失。
    这是必须彻底纠正和严加禁止的。因为这种胡“整”乱“斗”学生的作法，是完全和我们党和人民政府对于青年一代的教育精神、教育政策相违背的。
    根据党和人民政府的教育政策，学校在处理学生在行为上的过失、缺点或思想问题时，应该采取善意的、关心的和爱护的态度。就是说，采用耐心说服、启发自觉、鼓舞诱导的教育方法，并通过一系列正面、积极、长期、细致的课堂教育和课外活动，使他们有效地改正缺点和错误。因为青年是在成长过程中，他们的性格是完全可以塑造的，问题的关键是我们用什么方法才能有力地从一定的方向上影响他们的心理和道德面貌。教育，这是一种极其复杂的思想工作。一个青年的正确的思想和高尚行为的形成，决不是采用任何简单、生硬、粗暴、野蛮等手段可以达到预期的目的的。
    但我们某些学校的领导人员和教师，完全不了解这些原则。他们采用种种恶劣的方法，甚至错误地采用对待反革命分子的办法来对待学生。这样便使党和人民政府的教育政策遭到了严重的破坏。
    至于像峰峰矿区工业学校领导人员那样，应当说还不止于此。从他们所犯的一系列的错误中看，他们不仅非法“斗争”学生、压制批评、压制民主、把学校视为自己的“独立王国”，而且他们已发展到抗拒上级党委和政府检查的地步。必须指出，他们的一切行为，是和他们长期的违法乱纪行为分不开的，也是和有关上级党委的官僚主义分不开的。
    各地党委宣传部门、教育领导机关必须十分注意这种状况。因为在我们的学校教育工作中，这种胡“整”乱“斗”学生的错误作法、违法乱纪行为如不严加禁止和彻底纠正，那便势必要使党和人民政府的教育政策遭到更大的破坏，给国家培养建设人材的工作带来更巨大的损失。
