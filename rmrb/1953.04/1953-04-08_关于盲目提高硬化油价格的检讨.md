    A Review of Blindly Increasing Hydrogenated Oil Prices
    Lin Hua, Deputy Director of the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau
    After the People's Daily published a criticism on February 25th on page two regarding our bureau's "blindly increasing hydrogenated oil prices, leading to unsalable products," we immediately organized relevant departments to conduct an inspection and initiated discussions. The result was that this criticism is completely correct and entirely consistent with the facts.
    Currently, in addition to the hydrogenated oil already stockpiled by state-owned trading departments, we also have several thousand tons stockpiled in our warehouses. This serious situation is entirely due to our daily immersion in the fog of bureaucracy, poor understanding of government policies, insensitivity to new developments, narrow vision, lack of investigation and research, and a purely profit-driven perspective.
    In 1949, under the leadership of the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry, we studied Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" concerning price issues. Although, with the help and education of higher authorities, we grasped some of the principles that "trying to extract as much profit as possible from the sale of industrial products and raising prices without limit, ostensibly to develop industry, is actually a NEPman slogan that can only narrow the industrial production base and damage industry." Therefore, we reduced the prices of several products, such as vulcanized blue from 27 million yuan per ton to 20.7 million yuan, then to 19.6 million yuan; cylinder oil from 28 million yuan per ton to 21.34 million yuan; and soft yellow oil from 27 million yuan per ton to 21.6 million yuan. However, our thinking was still not firm, and the erroneous idea arose that "as long as there is a profit to be made, it is okay to complete the profit target." As a result, we encountered sales difficulties, which is entirely a manifestation of the capitalist management method of blindly pursuing profit.
    Based on the criticism in the People's Daily, our comprehensive inspection revealed that, in terms of chemical product prices, not only hydrogenated oil but also other products have even more serious problems. The current sluggish sales of our bureau's products are by no means due to oversupply, but rather due to the high prices we set while simply pursuing profit. Subjectively, we wanted to create more profits for the country, but in reality, sluggish sales and reduced production have resulted in significant losses. We request the support of the Central Chemical Industry Administration in revising the prices of chemical products.
    As for deceiving higher authorities and falsely reporting profits, our inspection confirmed that this has not occurred. However, this is something we must be vigilant about in the future.

    关于盲目提高硬化油价格的检讨
    东北化学工业管理局副局长  林华
    二月二十五日人民日报第二版揭载对我局“盲目提高硬化油价格以致产品卖不出去”的批评后，我们立即组织有关部门进行了检查，并展开了讨论。结果认为这个批评是完全正确的，也是完全合乎事实的。
    目前我们的产品硬化油，除国营贸易部门积压的以外，我们的仓库内也还积压着数千吨。这种严重情况完全是由于我们每天沉浸在事务主义的雾海里，对于政府的政策领会太差，对新鲜事物感觉迟钝，视野狭小，缺乏调查研究，单纯利润观点所致。
    一九四九年在东北人民政府工业部领导下，我们曾经学习过联共（布）党史简明教程第九章关于价格问题，虽然在上级的帮助与教育下，领会了一些“从出卖工业品方面尽量多取利润，无限制地提高价格，美其名是为了发展工业。其实，这种耐普曼的口号只能缩小工业生产基础，破坏工业”的道理。因此对许多产品降低了一些价格，如硫化青由每吨二七○○万元降至二○七○万元又降至一九六○万元。汽缸油由每吨二八○○万元降至二一三四万元。软黄油由每吨二七○○万元降至二一六○万元。但是思想还很不坚定，便产生“为了完成利润指标，只要有利可赚就行”的错误想法，结果便酿成了销售的困难，这完全是盲目追逐利润的资产阶级的经营方式的一种表现。
    根据人民日报的批评，我们全面检查的结果，目前在化工产品价格方面，不仅硬化油并且在其他产品方面存在着更严重的问题，目前我局产品滞销决不是供过于求，而是我们单纯追逐利润而订出的高价作怪，主观上想多为国家创造利润，实际上滞销减产反而遭受重大损失，我们请求中央化学工业管理局支持我们修订化工产品价格。
    至于欺骗上级，谎报利润的情况，经检查后还是没有的。但这是值得我们今后警惕的。
