    Providing Materials to Grain Leadership Organs
      By Shen Kang, Cadre of Fengdu County Grain Bureau, Sichuan Province
    By Shen Chunlun, Cadre of Grain Depot No. 1, Fengdu County, Sichuan Province
    After studying Comrade An Ziwen's report "We must launch a resolute struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline throughout the country and in all organs at all levels," we were deeply educated. We have examined the many shortcomings in our work and are determined to correct them. However, we also recognize that "the serious existence of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in lower-level organizations is closely related to the bureaucracy of higher-level leading organs!" To help higher-level leading organs improve their work, we are providing some materials to higher-level grain leadership organs for reference.
    "Failure to Complete the Plan Means Going to Court"
    In July of last year, the Fuling Special District Grain Bureau held a meeting of grain bureau chiefs from various counties. The leading cadres of the bureau said: "Grain work is very important. The volume of purchase and sales is large. Failure to complete the task will result in a beating!" When the leading cadres of the Fengdu County Grain Bureau returned to the county to hold a meeting of the directors of grain depots in various districts, they followed suit and bluntly ordered: "If you fail to complete your tasks, you will also be beaten! There should be responsibility at each level!" Several comrades working in district grain depots returned to the countryside with heavy "ideological burdens." Comrade Qin Shouyu, a cadre of the Eighth District Grain Depot, cried twice on the way. In February of this year, when the county grain bureau was compiling the purchase and sales plan, fearing being labeled as having a "conservative view" or "lack of vision for development," it expanded the planned figures on its own. However, the Special District Grain Bureau, without any basis, increased the already expanded plan of the county grain bureau by 28.8 percent, saying that this was "to complete the task assigned by the higher authorities." When the county bureau raised difficulties, the leading cadres of the Special District Bureau said: "The plan is the law. Failure to complete it means going to court." However, the plans of the higher authorities do not fully consider the specific conditions of the lower levels.
    Not "Ships Arriving with No Grain," but "Grain Waiting for Ships to Arrive"
    Whether it was the former Southwest Grain Department or the Fuling Special District Grain Bureau, before assigning the task of grain transfer, they invariably issued several instructions in succession: "Process in large quantities, complete on schedule, and you will be fully responsible if 'ships arrive with no grain'!" Therefore, the county bureau tensely mobilized tens of thousands of migrant workers throughout the county to carry out processing, transportation, and bagging. In June of last year, the higher authorities instructed the county bureau to process 600,000 jin of rice in Gaojia Town and complete the transfer task within 15 days. The county bureau processed the rice day and night in accordance with the regulations. When the bagging was completed and ready to be shipped, the higher authorities suddenly called: "The plan has changed! Postpone the transfer for now." The "postponement of transfer" lasted for half a year. Due to difficulties in storage, more than 250,000 jin of the parboiled rice became moldy and deteriorated, resulting in a loss of over 30 million yuan in state property. For some grain, the higher authorities often called one moment to transport it to Hankou (150 jin per bag), and then called the next moment to repack it for Chongqing (123 jin per bag), and the time was pressing. They would call today and the ship would arrive tomorrow. In order to prevent the phenomenon of "ships arriving with no grain," the lower levels mobilized workers overnight to repack the grain bags. In Gaojia Town alone, more than 10,000 sacks were repacked in November of last year, wasting over 2.5 million yuan of state property. Packaging workers said: "Are you crazy! Yesterday you told us to pack 150 jin per bag, and today you tell us to repack 123 jin per bag. You have a lot of money, but we think it's a pity!" Such things have happened many times at various grain transportation points throughout the county, and the waste of state property is impossible to calculate.
    Cadres Inspecting Work Enjoying Sightseeing
    Leading comrades at the higher levels sit in their offices, issue instructions, urge summaries, and demand figures, but rarely send people down to inspect the work. Occasionally, one or two people are sent, but they just make a circle like "imperial envoys" and that's it, so there is no way to discover problems or guide the work. In November of last year, the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau sent Comrade Zhu Jinzhong to Gaojia Town, Fengdu, to inspect the grain situation. After he arrived in Gaojia Town, he put down his bedding and went sightseeing. When he returned to the depot, it was almost dark. He asked Comrade Zhou Duanben of the depot to grab a handful of rice for him to look at. The next day, before dawn, he rolled up his bedding, went down to the river, and caught a boat to leave. When passing through Fengdu, comrades asked him for his opinion on the grain work in Gaojia Town. He said, "The problem is not big, it doesn't matter much, it's not as serious as Fuling!" But in less than a month, the depot had an incident of more than 80,000 jin of public grain becoming moldy. No wonder some comrades are asking: "Did the comrade from the Provincial Grain Bureau come to inspect the grain, or just to visit the 'famous mountains' scenery of Fengdu?"
    Only Higher Levels Allowed to Reprimand People, Lower Levels Not Allowed to Offer Opinions
    In December of last year, the Minsheng Company's ship was delayed, and the company should have compensated the losses of the workers who moved the wooden boats. The lower-level units requested instructions from the Southwest Grain Department on how to resolve the matter. The comrade in the transportation department of the department, without understanding the true situation, issued an instruction criticizing the lower-level units: "Intentionally making things difficult for the Minsheng Company, this ideological style is extremely bad." Later, the boatmen reflected one after another: "The Grain Bureau is intentionally delaying our wages and not paying us!" Finally, the Fengdu County Financial and Economic Committee sent a letter to the department instructing them, and this problem was resolved. Lower-level units have to report business statistics figures to the Special District Grain Bureau by telephone before 10 pm every night, but the comrade in the bureau who answers the phone is often not at home. One time, they called until 11:30 pm and still couldn't get through. The next day, Liu Shujun of the Special District Grain Bureau called to urge: "Why haven't you reported the figures yet!" Xu Hongqing of the County Grain Bureau replied: "We called you last night, and no one answered until 11:30 pm. We heard that you all went dancing! We hope you can leave someone at home in the future!" These two sentences offended Comrade Liu, and he immediately lost his temper: "Wow! You are too irresponsible in your work! Where did I go dancing? You casually offer opinions on the phone, too impolite!" Since then, comrades have not dared to boldly reflect their opinions to the higher authorities in their work.
    When Work Goes Wrong, Push the Blame Downward
    In December of last year, the directly affiliated depot of the Fengdu County Grain Bureau needed to build a surrounding wall and had asked the leading cadres of the Fuling Special District Bureau and comrades from relevant departments by telephone, and they all agreed to build it. But in February of this year, when it was about to be completed, the various departments of the bureau shirked responsibility and said: "It violates the financial and economic system, you are responsible yourself!" In November of last year, regarding the issue of the urban-rural price difference for wheat, the bureau was consulted, and Li Xufan, the chief of the business section of the bureau, replied: "There is no urban-rural price difference." After the County Grain Bureau followed this, in less than half a month, Chief Li called again to deny this matter. Finally, he repeatedly instructed on the phone: "This is a matter of price policy, right or wrong! Everyone is responsible. You must not write it in the summary, so as not to let the higher authorities (Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau) see the problem!"

    向粮食领导机关提供一些材料
      四川省酆都县粮食局干部  沈抗
    四川省酆都县一区粮库干部  沈春伦
    我们学习了安子文同志“我们必须在全国范围内和各级机关中开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的坚决斗争”的报告后，受了很深刻的教育。我们检查了自己工作中存在的许多缺点，并决心加以改正。但我们也认识到：“下层组织中的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象的严重存在与上级领导机关的官僚主义有密切关系！”为了帮助上级领导机关改进工作，我们特向上级粮食领导机关反映一些材料，以供参考。
    “完不成计划要进法院”
    去年七月，涪陵专署粮食局召开各县粮食局长会议，局的领导干部说：“粮食工作很重要，收购、推销数量大，完不成任务要打屁股！”酆都县粮食局领导干部回县召开各区粮库主任会议时，就依样画葫芦，生硬地布置：“你们完不成任务也要打屁股，应该层层负责！”好几位区粮库工作同志背着沉重的“思想包袱”回到乡下去，八区粮库干部秦寿域同志在路上就哭了两场。今年二月，县粮食局编造购销计划时，怕戴“保守观点”或“没有发展眼光”的帽子，就自行把计划数字扩大，但专署粮食局又毫无根据地将县粮食局已经扩大的计划增加了百分之二十八点八，并说这“是为了要完成上级分配的任务”。县局提出有困难，专局领导干部又说：“计划就是法律，完不成就进法院。”但上级的计划却不充分考虑到下级的具体情况。
    不是“船到无粮”，而是“粮等船到”
    不管原西南粮食部也好，涪陵专署粮食局也好，在布置粮食外调任务之前，照例连续发了几个指示：“大量加工，按期完成，如发生‘船到无粮’现象，你们要负完全责任！”因此，县局就很紧张地在全县发动上万民工进行加工、调运、装包等工作。去年六月间，上级指示县局在高家镇加工稻谷六十万斤，并限期十五天以内完成外调任务。县局按照规定星夜加工。等到装包就绪正待启运时，上级忽然来了一个电话：“计划变了！暂不外调”。“暂不外调”的时间持续半年之久，由于保管困难，这批碛米霉烂变质二十五万多斤，损失了国家财产三千余万元。有些粮食，上级常常一会儿来电话叫运汉口（每包一百五十斤），一会儿又来电话叫改装重庆（每包一百二十三斤），且时间紧迫，今天打电话，明天就来轮船；下级为了防止“船到无粮”的现象，就漏夜发动工人改装粮包。仅去年十一月份在高家镇一地就改装了一万多条麻袋，浪费了国家财产二百五十余万元。包装工人说：“你们发疯啦！昨天叫装一百五十斤一包，今天又叫改装一百二十三斤一包，你们的钱真多，我们看来却很可惜！”像这样的事，在全县各运粮点上不知发生过好多次，浪费国家的财产就无法统计了。
    检查工作的干部游山玩水
    上级领导同志坐在办公室里，发指示，催总结，要数字，却很少派人下来检查工作；偶尔派一两个人来，也是“钦差大臣”式的绕一圈就算了，这样必然谈不到发现问题，指导工作了。去年十一月间，四川省粮食厅派了一位朱金钟同志来酆都高家镇检查粮食情况，他到达高家镇后，将被盖一放，就游玩去了。他回库时天快黑了，叫该库周端本同志去仓库给他抓了一把米来，看了一看；第二天，天还没有亮，就卷起被盖下河赶船走了。路过酆都，同志们征求他对高家镇粮食工作的意见，他说：“问题并不大，没有什么关系，还没有涪陵严重！”但不到一月时间，该库就发生了霉烂公粮八万余斤的事件，难怪有些同志在问：“省粮食厅那位同志是来检查粮食呢？还是光来游览酆都‘名山’风景呢？”
    只许上级教训人，不准下级提意见
    去年十二月，民生公司轮船误期，该公司应赔偿搬运木船工人的损失。下级单位曾向西南粮食部请示解决办法。该部调运处的同志不了解真实情况，就发出一个指示，批评下级单位：“有意为难民生公司，这种思想作风是极其恶劣的”。后来船工纷纷反映：“粮食局有意拖拉我们的工资，不付给我们！”最后由酆都县财政经济委员会给该部去信指示，这个问题才解决了。下级单位每天晚上十点钟以前要给专署粮食局用电话报告业务统计数字，但该局接电话的同志常不在家。有一次叫到晚上十一点半钟还叫不通。第二天专署粮食局刘淑君打电话来催：“你们为啥到现在还没有把数字报来！”县粮食局徐洪庆回答说：“昨晚给你们打电话，摇到十一点半钟都无人接，听说你们都去跳舞啦！今后希望能留一个人在家吧！”这两句话把刘同志冒犯了，他马上发起脾气来：“吓！你们对工作太不负责任啦！我那里去跳舞？你在电话上随随便便就提意见，太没有礼貌了！”就此以后，同志们在工作中有意见也不敢大胆向上级反映了。工作做错了，就往下边推
    去年十二月，酆都县粮食局直属库需要修建围墙，曾在电话上请示涪陵专局领导干部及有关部门同志，他们都同意修建。但在今年二月将要完工时，该局各部门却互相推卸责任说：“违反了财经制度，你们自己负责！”去年十一月份为了小麦的城乡差价问题，曾经请示该局，该局业务股股长李绪烦回答说：“没有城乡差价。”县粮食局遵照执行后，不到半个月，李股长却又打电话来否认这件事，最后，并再三在电话上嘱咐：“这是价格政策问题，不错也错啦！大家都有责任。你们决不要写在总结里去，以免上级（四川省粮食厅）看出问题来！”
