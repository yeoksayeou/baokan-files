Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 11th: General Li Xiangchao issued a statement today at the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. The full text is as follows:

    Both sides have reached an agreement, in accordance with Article 109 of the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, on the issue of repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war during hostilities. Our side has consistently advocated and will implement the full repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war held by us. Your side has indicated that you will invoke the provisions of Article 109, Paragraph 3 of the Geneva Convention and will only repatriate a portion of the prisoners of war held by you. Regarding this point, our side has pointed out that the provisions of Article 109, Paragraph 3 of the Geneva Convention must not be used as a pretext to forcibly obstruct the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war who wish to return to our side during hostilities. Now, our side must once again declare that, regarding those sick and wounded prisoners of war on our side who are not directly repatriated this time, our side reserves the right to request that they be handed over to a neutral country in order to obtain a fair resolution of the issue of their repatriation after the armistice.

    在遣返病伤战俘协定签字时李相朝将军发表声明
    【新华社开城十一日电】李相朝将军今天在关于遣返病伤战俘的协定签字时发表声明，全文如下：
    双方已经按照日内瓦公约中关于战俘待遇的一百零九条就在战事期间遣返病伤战俘的问题达成了协议。我方一贯主张并即将实行全部遣返我方收容下的病伤战俘。你方表示你们将援引日内瓦公约第一百零九条第三项的规定，只遣返你方所收容的一部分战俘。关于这一点，我方曾经指出，日内瓦公约第一百零九条第三项的规定，决不能被用为用强迫手段阻挠愿意在战事期间回到我方的病伤被俘人员的遣返的藉口。现在，我方必须再一次声明，关于凡此次未被直接遣返的我方病伤被俘人员，我方保留权利提出将他们交给中立国的要求，以便对他们在停战后的遣返问题取得公正的解决。
