Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 7th: Leaders of various democratic political parties and people's organizations in Korea have issued statements warmly supporting the declarations of the governments of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union regarding the Korean armistice negotiations.

Kim Tal-hyun, Chairman of the Cheondoist Chongu Party, said: The declarations by Marshal Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai put forward fair and new proposals to remove obstacles to the Korean armistice negotiations, and are full of sincerity for peace. The declaration by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov demonstrates the Soviet people's support for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and advocates that the Korean and Chinese people should obtain their due rights in the United Nations. This once again demonstrates the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. In order to stop the Korean War as soon as possible, and for the peace and security of the people of the Far East and the world, we fully support these declarations. Ending the bloodshed in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue is not only the unwavering desire of the people of Korea and China, but also in line with the will of the people all over the world.

Kim Won-bong, Chairman of the People's Republic Party, said: These declarations once again demonstrate to the world our side's firm and unshakable peaceful policy of achieving a fair and reasonable Korean armistice, thereby laying the foundation for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The governments of Korea and China have made consistent efforts to stop the bloodshed in Korea and restore peace, and now they have put forward new proposals, giving new hope and encouragement to peace-loving people all over the world. The U.S. side should accept our proposals to seek the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war and a solution to the issue of all prisoners of war, and implement an armistice in Korea.

Jeong Seong-yeon, Vice-Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Party, said: The declarations of the governments of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union put forward new steps to stop the bloodshed in Korea and promote peace in the Far East and Asia. Therefore, we warmly support these declarations. The new proposals put forward by our side this time make it fully possible to fairly resolve the issue of repatriation of prisoners and achieve a Korean armistice. I believe that as long as the U.S. side has the sincerity to achieve a Korean armistice and restore peace in Korea, our new proposals can be fully accepted.

Seo Hui, Vice-Chairman of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, said: We have consistently worked hard to achieve an armistice, so we warmly support the declarations of Marshal Kim Il-sung, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and Foreign Minister Molotov. These declarations not only express the firm will of the people of Korea and China to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but also are in complete agreement with the wishes of people all over the world. If the U.S. side has the sincerity to seek peace, then it must accept our proposals and strive to achieve the Korean armistice that the people of the world desire on a fair and reasonable basis.

    朝鲜各民主政党和人民团体的负责人
    热烈拥护朝中苏三国政府的声明
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜各民主政党和人民团体的负责人分别发表谈话，热烈拥护朝、中、苏三国政府关于朝鲜停战谈判的声明。
    天道教青友党委员长金达铉说：金日成元帅和周恩来总理的声明，提出了扫除朝鲜停战谈判障碍的公正的新建议，充满了对于和平的诚意。苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的声明，表明了苏联人民对于和平解决朝鲜问题的支持，并主张朝鲜人民和中国人民在联合国中应获得自己应有的权利。这又一次显示了苏联和平的对外政策。我们为了早日停止朝鲜战争，为了远东和全世界人民的和平与安全，完全支持这些声明。在朝鲜结束流血战争与和平解决朝鲜问题，不仅是朝中两国人民始终不变的愿望，而且是符合全世界人民的意志的。
    人民共和党委员长金元凤说：这些声明再一次在全世界面前表明了我方要公平合理地达成朝鲜停战，从而为和平解决朝鲜问题打下基础的坚定不移的和平政策。朝中两国政府为了停止在朝鲜的流血战争和恢复和平，曾作了一贯的努力，现在又提出了新的建议，给了全世界爱好和平人民以新的希望和鼓舞。美方应该接受我们的建议，来谋求遣返伤病战俘和关于全体战俘问题的解决，在朝鲜实行停战。
    北朝鲜民主党副委员长郑圣彦说：朝、中、苏三国政府的声明，提出了新的步骤，来停止朝鲜的流血战争，促进远东和亚洲的和平。因此，我们热烈地支持这些声明。我方这次提出的新建议，使公正地解决遣返俘虏问题、实现朝鲜停战有了充分的可能。我认为：只要美方具有实现朝鲜停战、使朝鲜恢复和平的诚意，那么，我方这个新建议是完全可以被接受的。
    朝鲜职业总同盟副委员长徐辉说：我们一贯努力争取停战，因此，我们热烈支持金日成元帅、周恩来总理兼外交部长，和莫洛托夫外长的声明。这些声明不但表示了朝中两国人民和平解决朝鲜问题的坚决意志，而且和全世界人民的意愿是完全一致的。美方如有谋求和平的诚意，那就必须接受我方的建议，在公平合理的基础上来努力实现全世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战。
