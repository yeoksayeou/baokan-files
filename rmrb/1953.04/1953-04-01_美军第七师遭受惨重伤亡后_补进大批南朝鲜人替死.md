Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 31st. According to soldiers of the U.S. 7th Division recently captured, after suffering heavy casualties in the Battle of Triangle Hill, the division replenished its ranks with a large number of South Koreans to be used as cannon fodder for the American troops. It is said that South Koreans now account for half of the total number of the division, and in some companies, they even exceed this proportion. Company A of the 31st Regiment of the U.S. 7th Division had only thirty-five men left after the Battle of Triangle Hill. By February 20th of this year, the company's strength had been replenished to one hundred and eighty-nine men, of whom one hundred and six were South Koreans. In all rifle squads of the company, except for the squad leader and one or two American soldiers, the rest were all South Koreans. According to U.S. prisoners of war, their superiors told them: "There are not enough Americans, but there are South Koreans. Give them weapons, and they can die for us." The treatment of these South Koreans who were added to the U.S. military units is vastly different from that of American soldiers. For example, an American sergeant can receive two hundred and twenty U.S. dollars per month, while a South Korean sergeant receives only the equivalent of six U.S. dollars per month. American officers said triumphantly, "This is the cheapest deal. Give them the least money and send them to the most dangerous places."

    美军第七师遭受惨重伤亡后
    补进大批南朝鲜人替死
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】据最近被俘的美军第七师的士兵说，该师在上甘岭战役中遭到惨重伤亡后，补进了大批南朝鲜人，替美军送死。据说，目前该师中南朝鲜人已占总人数的一半，个别连队甚至超过这个比例。美七师三十一团一连在上甘岭战役后只剩下了三十五个人，到今年二月二十日，全连人数补充到一百八十九人，其中有南朝鲜人一百零六人。该连所有步枪班除了班长和一两个美军士兵以外，其余都是南朝鲜人。据美军俘虏供称，他们的上级曾这样地告诉他们：“美国人不够，南朝鲜有人，把武器给他们，他们就可以替我们卖命。”这些补进美军部队的南朝鲜人的待遇和美军士兵相差十分悬殊，例如一个美军中士每月可以得到二百二十元美金，而一个南朝鲜籍的中士每月所得的薪水折合起来却只有六块美金。美国军官们得意地说：“这是最便宜的买卖，给他们最少的钱，叫他们到最危险的地方去。”
