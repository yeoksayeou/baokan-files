    Beijing Jingxi Mining Bureau's Chengzi Coal Mine Leadership Should Emphasize Workers' Daily Diet and Hygiene
    Xiao Lan
    The leadership of the Chengzi Coal Mine, under the Beijing Jingxi Mining Bureau, has not paid enough attention to the workers' health and hygiene, which has affected the workers' health and reduced attendance rates. As a result, the production plan for the first quarter of this year was not completed on schedule.
    Over the past three years, the Chengzi Coal Mine has made improvements in worker health and hygiene, such as changing to water-washed wind picks to reduce the invasion of coal dust and stone chips on workers' health; expanding the clinic and adding sanatorium wards for patients with chronic diseases; improving canteen hygiene and rebuilding bathhouses during the patriotic health campaign last year; and, with the assistance of the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China, training a group of worker first-aiders and starting to establish first-aid stations underground this year, and so on. However, some problems that could be solved and urgently need to be solved, such as the workers' drinking water and eating problems underground, have not been well resolved so far, resulting in an increase in the number of workers suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. According to statistics from the mine's clinic in January and February this year, the rate of gastrointestinal diseases accounted for about 50 percent of the rate of internal medicine diseases.
    The fact that many workers suffer from gastrointestinal diseases is not accidental. Their working time underground is eight hours, and if you add the time for handover and walking underground, they have to stay in the mine for about ten hours a day. However, they cannot drink boiled water or eat hot food during such a long period of time. According to the investigation, they mostly drink raw water from the mine and eat hard steamed buns and pancakes made the night before. In this way, gastrointestinal diseases grow among the workers. Let's take a group of workers, Yang Changhe, as an example. He is a member of the Communist Youth League. Since he came to work at the Chengzi Mine in June 1951, he has always been very active in production and never asked for leave, but later, because he often drank raw water and ate hard dry food underground, the root of gastrointestinal disease was planted. In February this year, he began to feel uncomfortable in his stomach and could not eat anything. In March, he could only barely eat some noodle soup. Another example is the model production team of the whole mine - the squad leader of the 15th squad, Tong Dexi, also suffered from bad stomach problems from May last year due to drinking raw water and eating cold food. He could only eat a bowl of noodle soup or a steamed bun for each meal. In March this year, he finally fell ill.
    The problem of drinking water and hot food underground can be solved. The mine leadership made a hot water truck last year to send boiled water underground, but because no one was in charge, the water bucket had rusted, and the boiled water turned red as soon as it was poured in. When the bucket broke, it was not repaired in time. Moreover, the water delivery was not timely, and by the time the water truck was delivered, the workers had often eaten their dry food, so they could not drink hot water when they ate. Therefore, the problem of workers drinking water underground has not been solved in practice. The same is true for the hot food problem underground. The mine had planned to solve this problem with emphasis in the first quarter of this year, with the ground preparing the meals and sending them underground on time. But by the end of March, the plan fell through because the problem of advance funds had not been resolved. In fact, a portion of the factory director's fund could be drawn first as a temporary advance, and then deducted together when wages are paid (because the factory director's fund is only used for workers' welfare). Or explain to the workers that they should pre-purchase meal tickets; or find ways to heat the dry food brought by the workers and send it underground. However, the mine leadership did not think of many ways, nor did they consult with the workers well, and dragged down the hot food problem on the grounds that no advance funds could be made.
    Why has the problem of drinking water and hot food for workers in the Chengzi Mine not been completely solved? The key is that the leadership does not pay enough attention to it. The mine leadership still does not pay enough attention to health and hygiene, which is related to the health of the workers, and rarely conducts research on it. During the spring security inspection campaign this year, the underground environmental hygiene and the workers' daily hygiene, such as drinking water, dry food boxes, etc., were not inspected at all; as for the spring patriotic health campaign, it was not carried out well.
    The remnant of the thinking of "only valuing machines and not valuing people" still exists in some cadres, and they do not care about the workers' diseases, which is an important reason why the health care work of the Chengzi Mine cannot be improved. For example, in January this year, the water dripping from the roof underground (that is, the water seeping from the underground rock formations) was very heavy. Many workers were working under the dripping water without raincoats. Seven people in the 11th squad fell ill because they were exposed to the water. However, the responsible comrades of the production and technology section did not try to solve this problem, and the twenty raincoats stored in the warehouse were not taken out for the workers to use. In March this year, the number of patients increased, and the attendance rate decreased, so that the production plan for the first quarter could not be completed. However, the administrative leadership did not conduct research on the workers' health and hygiene work, and did not put forward active improvement measures. Individual administrative leaders and cadres even believe that the main reason for the low attendance rate is that the workers have "problems" in their thinking. Obviously, this understanding is incorrect.
    Recently, the leadership of the Chengzi Mine has begun to pay attention to the drinking water and hot food problems of the underground workers, and held a meeting to discuss them. It is hoped that the Party and Communist Youth League organizations and trade union organizations of the mine will assist the administrative leadership in taking effective measures to solve the above problems, so as to ensure the health of the underground workers and successfully complete the production tasks for each quarter.

    北京京西矿务局所属城子煤矿领导方面应重视工人的日常饮食卫生
    小岚
    北京京西矿务局所属城子煤矿领导方面对工人的卫生保健工作注意不够，使工人的健康受到影响，出勤率降低，今年第一季度的生产计划因而没有按期完成。
    城子煤矿三年多以来在工人卫生保健工作方面是有改进的，如改用水洗式风锤，减少了煤尘和石屑对工人健康的侵袭；扩大了诊疗所，增设了慢性病员的休养病房；在去年爱国卫生运动中改进了食堂卫生，改建了澡塘；今年在中国红十字会总会北京市分会的协助下，训练了一批工人急救员，开始在井下建立急救站，等等。但某些可能解决而又迫切需要解决的问题，例如工人的井下饮水和吃饭问题，至今还没有很好地得到解决，因而工人患肠胃病的增多。根据该矿诊疗所今年一、二月份的统计，肠胃病率占内科病率的百分之五十左右。
    许多工人患肠胃病，并不是偶然的。他们在井下工作的时间是八小时，如果再加上交接班和井下走路的时间，每天总要在矿井中停留十小时左右。而他们在这样长的时间内却不能喝到开水和吃到热的饭菜。据调查，他们喝的多是井下的生水、吃的是前一天晚上做好的发硬的馒头和烙饼。这样，肠胃病就在工人中滋长起来了。拿一组工人杨常和来做个例子吧，他是一个青年团员，从一九五一年六月到城子矿工作以来，一向生产很积极，从来也不请假，但后来因经常在井下喝生水、吃发硬的干粮，肠胃病的病根就种下了。今年二月间他开始感到胃里不舒服，吃不下什么东西，三月里就只能勉强吃些挂面汤。再如全矿的模范生产小组——十五组的班长佟德喜，也是因为喝生水吃冷饭，他从去年五月起肠胃就不好，每顿只能吃一碗面汤或一个馒头；今年三月间，他终于病倒了。
    井下饮水和热食问题是可以解决的。该矿领导方面曾在去年做了热水车，把开水送到井下去，但因为没有专人负责，水桶已经生锈，开水倒进去以后即变成了红色的水；桶坏了，也没有及时修理。而且送水也不及时，等到水车送去时，工人往往都已经吃过干粮了，以致在吃饭的时候喝不到热水。因此，实际上工人井下饮水的问题仍然没有解决。井下热食问题也是如此。该矿曾计划在今年第一季度中有重点地解决这个问题，由井上把饭做好，按时送到井下去。但到三月底因为垫款的问题没有解决，计划又落空了。其实，可以先由厂长基金中抽出一部分暂垫，发工资时再一并扣还（因为厂长基金是只限于用在工人福利事业方面的）；或者向工人说明，要他们预买饭票；或将工人带来的干粮设法加热后送到井下去。但该矿领导方面既没有多想办法，也没有很好地和工人商量，就在不能垫款的理由下，把热食问题拖下来了。
    为什么城子矿工人的井下饮水和热食问题未能得到彻底解决呢？关键在于领导方面不重视。对于关系着工人健康的卫生保健工作，该矿领导方面还是注意得不够的，平时很少进行研究。在今年春季保安大检查运动中，对井下环境卫生和工人日常卫生，如饮水、干粮箱等等，根本就没有进行检查；至于春季爱国卫生运动，也没有很好开展起来。
    在某些干部中还存在着“只重机器不重人”的思想残余，对工人的疾病不关心，这是城子矿卫生保健工作不能更好改善的重要原因。如今年一月间井下淋头水（即由井下岩层中渗出的水）很大，许多工人因为没有雨衣，都站在淋头水下进行工作，第十一组有七个人因被水淋而病倒了。可是生产技术科的负责同志没有设法解决这个问题，库房里存着的二十身雨衣没有拿出来给工人用。今年三月间病员增多，出勤率减低，以致第一季度生产计划未能完成；但行政领导方面对于工人的卫生保健工作仍没有进行研究，提出积极的改进办法。个别行政领导同志和干部竟认为，出勤率低的主要原因是工人思想上有“问题”。显然，这种认识是不对的。
    最近城子矿领导方面已开始注意井下工人的饮水和热食问题，并召开会议进行了讨论。希望该矿党和青年团的组织以及工会组织，协助行政领导方面采取有效的办法，解决上述问题，以保证井下工人的健康，胜利地完成每个季度的生产任务。
