How to Concentrate District Cadres' Efforts to Lead Spring Ploughing Production
    Li Shiting
    In order to concentrate the efforts of district and village cadres to specifically lead spring ploughing production, the Bai Cheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized 180 county-level机关 cadres in late March, led by county committee members, into 14 working groups to go to the villages to assist each district's work. However, how to strengthen the district committee's leadership of spring ploughing? On March 29, they discussed with all comrades of the Tenth District Committee the issue of concentrating district cadres' strength to lead spring ploughing. Wu Xianzhang, the district committee secretary, reflected: "This is not well organized! There are a lot of people in the meeting at the district level, but not many people go to work in the villages. ‘There are eight tables for meals, but not many people working.’" Out of the 21 cadres in the district, only seven went to the villages once in January, nine went to the villages twice in February, and nine went to the villages once in March. This time, only 14 people went to the villages, of which three specialized in their own department's work, and five went to the county to attend meetings or returned to the district to handle their own business. Only six people persisted in leading production in the villages. Because the district cadres could not spare enough people, six of the thirteen villages in the district were rarely helped with their work. By March 24, these six villages had not yet delivered manure, the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience was only generally publicized, improved farm tools were not prepared, carts were not pulled, seeds were not carefully selected, and mutual aid groups had not set production increase plans. After the party rectification in Jiqing Village, no district cadres had been there for more than two months. More than half of the mutual aid groups in the village had collapsed, and the group of Gao Hongcai, a county labor model, had also collapsed because the issue of mutual benefit had not been resolved for a long time. The dispersion of leadership has caused obvious losses in production.
    In order to solve this problem, all district cadres were once organized to discuss the causes of the above phenomenon and suggestions for improvement in the future.
    According to everyone's reflection, there are three reasons for the dispersion of the strength of district cadres: 1. Many meetings in the county; 2. Many tasks from higher-level leaders; 3. Lack of connection between various departments in the district.
    The number of meetings in the county is alarming. The following is a statistical table of the Tenth District cadres attending meetings in the county in the first quarter of this year to illustrate:

    Some cadres went to the county for meetings three times a month, and some were not in the district for a whole month. Therefore, some assistants are called "Ambassadors to Bai (referring to Baicheng County)" and "Meeting Assistants". The district committee leaders felt anxious that there were many villages, few cadres, and tight tasks, but they could not do anything about it.
    The county-level departments unilaterally emphasized and deployed their own departmental work, making it impossible for district cadres to do the central work well. Armed Forces Officer Shang Baidong said: "The sentence 'combining central work with departmental work' is easy to say, but difficult to do. When I go to the county for meetings, the department (referring to the County Armed Forces Department) says, 'Our work is military in nature, and we must do what we are ordered to do. It is different from other departments, and it is a violation of discipline to delay it.' Since I started doing armed forces work, I have never been able to combine it. It's really difficult on both sides!" Culture and Education Assistant Sun Wanfu said: "There are more than 20 schools in the district. It is possible to combine the work in the villages with the school work, but when I reported to the county, the head of the Culture and Education Section criticized me and said: 'The sixth resolution of the County People's Congress is the central work (referring to the elimination of illiteracy), what central work are you doing?'" The head of the County Health Section instructed the Health Assistant: "The Health Assistant is specifically for doing health work, otherwise you will make a serious mistake. If there is a plague, see if your head will stay on your shoulders!" Everyone believes that "if he is a good cadre of the district committee, he is not a good cadre of the section."
    The county's excessive reporting also makes the work below busy and unable to concentrate on leading production. Recently, the county called the district committee to report within half a day on the experience, lessons learned, types of mutual aid groups, land, labor, population, manure, and other figures organized. With such a tight task, it is impossible to catch up even if you sit in the office and do the statistics now. The Agricultural Assistant said: "If you need it urgently, you have to estimate it. Add a little and subtract a little from the original numbers and it will be fine. Otherwise, you will be criticized in the report."
    Because the county-level agencies and departments all emphasize vertical system leadership and emphasize the work of their own departments away from the central work, it gives the impression below that "everything is central, and everything is important." Everything must be led by the party committee, which weakens or abandons the district committee's leadership of production. The situation in the Tenth District is that only the district committee's organization committee members, propaganda committee members, League district committee secretaries, women's federation directors, and others are leading production. They said: "We can't count on the government assistants!"
    The countryside is very scattered, and there are very few staff members in various departments in the district. They are also working independently. When the higher authorities assign a task, they have to run around everywhere and go to every village, which results in a lot of work in the village, a lot of meetings for the masses, and a lot of formalism.
    After discussion, everyone believed that this situation needs to be changed in three aspects:
    First, the county committee and the county people's government should strictly control the meetings of various departments. During the busy farming season, all meetings that hinder production should be stopped. In general, each department should not hold meetings more than once every two months, and they should be arranged in a planned manner. The county-level departments should establish an overall perspective, distinguish the priorities of their own department's work, and put forward practical and feasible work requirements that revolve around the central work on the principle of not affecting production, and then submit them to the district for execution after being approved by the county committee and the county people's government. We must oppose the practice of unilaterally emphasizing one's own work and suppressing production work with other work. We must strictly control the reporting. Necessary numerical investigations should give the lower levels sufficient preparation time and should be reviewed and approved by the county leaders in advance.
    Second, in terms of the leadership of the district committee, we must first concentrate the strength of the district cadres and focus on leading spring ploughing. This time, the Tenth District only left the Civil Affairs Assistant and the Expense Accountant in the district to handle daily work, and all other district cadres went deep into the villages and villages to lead spring ploughing. In order to take care of the work of various departments, the method of mutual delegation is implemented. For example, the Finance and Grain Assistant currently has three tasks: one is to sort out the arrears of public grain, the second is to teach the accountants of two villages to learn how to keep accounts, and the third is to sort out the statistical materials of land grades and report them to the county. The first item is entrusted to the comrades working in the villages to help the village finance and grain committee members complete it; the second item is to assign the finance and grain assistant to his key villages in the division of labor to do it in conjunction with the central work; the third item is to entrust the cadres staying in the district to do the statistics and report them to the county. Before going to the villages, the cadres of each department should put forward the work that needs to be done urgently at present, make unified arrangements, and explain the working methods; the comrades who go to the villages have the responsibility to take some time to do the work entrusted to them. Secondly, we must educate district cadres to change the style of replacing the village cadres with their own individual work and relying on grassroots organizations to carry out the work. Help the village cadres to make work plans according to the requirements of the district committee, and help the village party branch to cultivate and improve the village cadres; the district cadres should go deep into reality, set an example, and teach the village cadres to learn how to use the organizational strength to do the work well.
    Third, the various departments at the district level should clearly recognize that they have the responsibility to do the central work well. On the one hand, they must mobilize the lower-level organizations (such as the Youth League, the Women's Federation, etc.) to complete the central tasks, and on the other hand, they must distinguish the priorities of their own department's business to prevent rigid arrangements from hindering the central work.

    怎样使区干部集中力量领导春耕生产
    李石亭
    中共白城县委为了集中区、村干部力量，具体领导春耕生产，在三月下旬组织了一百八十名县级机关干部，由县委委员亲自率领，分成十四个工作组，下乡协助各区工作。但是，如何加强区委对春耕的领导呢？三月二十九日，他们同十区区委会全体同志研究集中区干部力量领导春耕的问题，区委书记武宪章反映：“这算没个整！在区上开会满满一屋子人，下乡工作没有几个人，‘真是吃饭八张桌，干活人不多’。”全区二十一名干部，在一月份只有七个干部下乡一次，二月份九个人下乡两次，三月份九个人下乡一次。这次也只有十四个人下乡，其中有三个专门搞自己的部门工作，五人到县开会或回区处理自己的业务工作，坚持在村里领导生产的只有六个人。全区十三个村，因为区干部分不过来，有六个村很少有人去帮助工作。这六个村到三月二十四日还没有送粪，肇源丰产经验只做了一般的宣传，改良农具没有准备，槎子没拖，种子没有精选，互助组没有订增产计划。吉庆村从整党以后两个多月没有区干部去过，全村互助组垮了一多半，县劳动模范高洪才小组因两利问题长期得不到解决也垮了。领导力量分散，造成生产上的损失是很明显的。
    为了解决这个问题，曾经组织全区区干部座谈了产生上述现象的原因和今后改进的意见。
    从大家的反映看来，使区干部力量分散的原因是三个：一、县里会议多；二、上级领导头绪多；三、区里各部门互不联系。
    县里会议之多是惊人的。这里有今年第一季度第十区干部到县开会的统计表可以说明：召开会议部门  参加会议人员  会议时间
    一月份武  装  部  武装干事          五    天民  政  科  民政助理          三    天公  安  局  公安助理          八    天农  业  科  农业助理          十    天文  教  科  文教助理          三    天行政训练班  卫生助理          十五  天文  教  科  扫除文盲干部      三    天财  政  科  经费会计          二十二天物资交流会  区    长          七    天物资交流会  合作社区办事处主任七    天县  联  社  合作社区办事处主任八    天县  委  会  区委副书记        三    天
    二月份县  委  会团区委书记、妇联主任民政助理、宣传委员四    天县  委  会  区委副书记      三    天武  装  部  武装干事      五    天县  政  府  区  长      五    天县  政  府  农业助理      五    天组  织  部  副区长      五    天组  织  部  区组织委员      五    天公  安  局  公安助理      十  二  天文  教  科  扫除文盲干部      四    天财政科  经费会计      七    天县政府秘书室  区政府文书      四    天粮  食  科  财粮助理      六    天省      委  区委书记      十  二  天三月份县  委  会  区委扩大会议      七    天团  县  委  团区委书记      四    天团  县  委  团干事      四    天武  装  部  武装部长      四    天武  装  部  武装干事      四    天行政训练班  文    书      九    天行政训练班  农业助理      十  一  天县  联  社  合作社区办事处主任      一  个  月公  安  局  公安助理      一  个  月财  政  科  经费会计      十  五  天
    有的干部一个月上县里开三次会，有的一个整月不在区里。因此，有的助理员被称为“驻白（指白城县城）大使”“会议助理”。区委领导上感到村子多、干部少、任务紧，干着急使不上劲。
    县级各部门孤立地强调和布置自己的部门工作，使区干部无法做好中心工作。武装干事商柏栋说：“中心工作结合部门工作，这句话倒是好说，做起来可就难啦。到县里开会，部里（指县委武装部）说‘咱们的工作是军事性质，命令做什么就得干什么，可不同别的部门，耽误了是违犯纪律。’我从做武装工作起，一直是结合不起来，真是两头受难！”文教助理孙万福说：“全区一共二十多个学校，下乡工作是可以结合学校工作的，可是到县里汇报时，文教科长提出批评说：‘县人民代表会议第六条决议就是中心工作（指扫除文盲工作），你还做啥中心工作。’”县卫生科长指示卫生助理：“卫生助理就是专门搞卫生工作，不然就犯严重错误，发生鼠疫看你脑袋长住长不住！”大家认为“如果是区委的好干部，就不是科里的好干部”。
    县里滥发表报也使下面工作忙乱，无法专心致力领导生产。最近，县里打电话要区委半天内报告组织起来的经验、教训、互助组类型、土地、劳动力、人口、粪肥等数字；任务这么紧，就是坐在办公室现统计也赶不过来。农业助理说：“要得紧就得估计，把原来数字加一点去一点就对付上了。不然，就得挨通报受批评。”
    由于县上各机关、部门都强调垂直系统领导，脱离中心工作强调本部门工作，给下面形成“事事中心，事事重要”的感觉。事事都要党委领导，结果就使区委削弱或放弃了对生产的领导。十区的情形是：领导生产的只有区委会的组织委员、宣传委员、团区委书记、妇联主任等人。他们说：“对政府助理员算没个指望！”
    农村很分散，区里各部门工作人员很少，又是各自单干，上级布置一件工作，就得到处乱跑，村村都到，结果就使村里工作多，群众开会多，形式主义多。
    大家经过座谈，认为这种情况需要从三方面改变：
    第一、县委和县人民政府应该严格控制各部门的会议。各部门在农忙季节应该停止一切妨碍生产的会议，一般的每个部门召开会议不能多于两个月一次，并要有计划地加以安排；县里各部门应树立全局观点，把本部门工作分清轻重缓急，在不影响生产的原则下提出围绕中心工作的切实可行的工作要求，经县委、县人民政府批准再下达各区执行。反对那种片面强调自己工作、并以别种工作压倒生产工作的做法。要严格控制表报。必要的数字调查，要给下边充分的准备时间，并应事先经过县领导同志审查批准。
    第二、在区委领导方面，首先要集中区干部力量，抓紧领导春耕。十区这次只把民政助理和经费会计留在区里处理日常工作，其余区干部都深入村、屯领导春耕。为了照顾各部门工作，实行互相委托办法。如财粮助理当前有三件工作，一是整理公粮尾欠，二是教会两个村会计学会记账，三是把土地等级统计材料整理报县。第一件，委托到各村工作的同志帮助村财粮委员完成；第二件，在分工时把财粮助理分配到他的工作重点村，结合中心工作去做；第三件，委托留在区上的干部代为统计报县。各部门干部在下乡前，要把当前急需做的工作提出来，统一安排，交代工作方法；下乡的同志都有责任抽出一定时间做好被委托的工作。其次，教育区干部转变抛开村干部自己单干的包办代替作风，要他们依靠基层组织进行工作。帮助村干部按照区委的要求做出工作计划，并帮助村支部培养提高村干部；区干部要深入实际，作出样子，教村干部学会运用组织力量做好工作。
    第三、区级各个部门应明确认识自己有责任做好中心工作。一方面要动员下层组织（如青年团、妇联等）去完成中心任务，一方面把本部门业务分清轻重缓急，防止做硬性的布置，妨害中心工作。
