    U.S. Embargo Policy Harms the Interests of Southeast Asian Countries
    Hu Jin
    The so-called embargo policy imposed by the United States on capitalist countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, prevents these countries from conducting equal and mutually beneficial trade with the countries of the democratic peace camp. This has caused them great damage, facilitated the United States' manipulation of these countries' foreign trade, and allowed the United States to plunder and enslave them.
    From 1951 to 1952, many countries in Asia and the Far East experienced a deterioration in foreign trade, an increase in import surpluses, and a decrease in foreign exchange reserves. Ten countries in Asia and the Far East had a trade surplus of $748 million in the first half of 1951, but by the same period in 1952, their trade had become a deficit of approximately $876 million. India's trade deficit in eight months of 1952 reached 790 million rupees. Indonesia's trade balance changed from a surplus of over 1 billion rupiah in 1951 to a deficit of over 1.6 billion rupiah in 1952. In Ceylon, exports were 5 percent lower than imports in four months of 1952, whereas exports were 16 percent higher than imports in the same period of the previous year. The situation in Malaya was also serious, with exports in the first half of 1952 decreasing by 41 percent compared to the same period last year, quickly reversing from a surplus of 980 million Straits dollars to a deficit of 32 million Straits dollars.
    Why did these countries' foreign trade experience such a significant reversal?
    Of course, the fundamental reason is that these countries, which have long suffered from imperialist rule and exploitation, have always been raw material production areas and markets for colonial countries to sell their goods. After World War II, the capitalist world market shrank even further, and the monopoly capital of the British, French, and Dutch colonial countries strengthened their exploitation of these countries. American monopoly capital stretched its tentacles everywhere, causing Southeast Asia and other colonial countries to fall into even deeper economic disasters. According to "International Market" magazine in February 1952: underdeveloped countries provided 57 percent of U.S. imports and consumed 44 percent of U.S. exports. At the same time, Western European countries exported 74 percent of their exports to underdeveloped countries, and colonial countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands monopolized the raw material exports of Southeast Asia and many other underdeveloped countries. The colonial nature of these underdeveloped countries' foreign trade and unequal exchange—that is, underdeveloped countries exporting low-priced raw materials and purchasing high-priced industrial products—subjected them to the brutal exploitation of imperialist countries. This is a well-known fact. It is estimated that as a result of purchasing manufactured goods from the United States at high prices and selling raw materials to the United States at low prices, the trade deficit of Asian and Far Eastern countries with the United States in the first half of 1952 reached $235 million; during the same period, the trade deficit with Britain reached $132 million.
    However, the current plunder of Southeast Asian countries by the United States and other colonial countries is inseparable from their war policies pursued on the basis of the deepening of the overall capitalist crisis; and the so-called embargo policy that the United States forces countries to implement is part of its war policy, or it can be said that it is an arrogant means by which the United States forces countries to provide resources and markets to serve its war policy. It is this embargo policy that has further deteriorated the foreign trade situation of Southeast Asian countries.
    The "International Development Advisory Board" appointed by the U.S. President in accordance with the so-called International Development Act stated in its first report in March 1951: "The more deeply we study the relationship between the economic development of (underdeveloped regions) and defense, the more we feel that they are truly inseparable." The report also emphasized the fact that "...virtually all natural rubber, manganese, chromium, and tin, and a quarter of our zinc and copper, and a third or more of our lead and aluminum, come from abroad, mostly from underdeveloped areas. The vast majority of lead sand is also like this. Of the imports that are militarily important and included in stockpiled materials, 73 percent of their total value comes from these areas." Taking the Southeast Asian region as an example, due to long-term dependence on colonial imperialism, the industry of Southeast Asian countries is extremely backward, and many countries cannot even talk about establishing industries, but only develop a single raw material production in a distorted way. At present, the large output of these raw materials in Southeast Asian countries, such as natural rubber, tin, manganese, jute, petroleum, and mica, has become an important source for the United States to stockpile strategic raw materials and import industrial raw materials annually. For example, 97.2 percent of the natural rubber imported by the United States in 1950 came from Southeast Asia, and 64.8 percent of the refined tin imported by the United States during the same period came from Malaya. The jute and its products needed by the United States are all imported from Pakistan and India. In 1949, the manganese imported by the United States from India accounted for 29.4 percent of its total imports. Coconut oil produced in the Philippines accounts for 97 percent of the world's production, and is the entire source of coconut oil needed by the United States for making glycerin (explosive raw material), soap, and synthetic rubber over the years.
    Therefore, in order to monopolize the supply of raw materials and the market for sales of goods in Southeast Asia to serve its war economy, in addition to forcing the British, French, and Dutch colonial countries to open up the Southeast Asian market, and making large investments in Southeast Asian countries with the "Point Four Program" and other "economic assistance," attempting to replace the rule of British, French, and Dutch imperialism, the United States coerced Southeast Asian countries to participate in the embargo, cutting off their trade with the democratic world countries, so that it could further carry out robber-style economic plunder and political control over Southeast Asian countries. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The U.S. government is using its 'blockade' and 'embargo' policies to interfere in the internal affairs, foreign policy, and commercial trade policies of other countries, destroy the normal relations of the world market, and attempt to monopolize certain raw materials and sales markets, expand U.S. military bases, so as to manipulate the economic lifeline and political life of these countries."
    The recent statement issued by the Ceylon government more fully exposes the predatory nature of the U.S. embargo policy. One-third of Ceylon's annual income relies on the export of rubber, while it needs to import two-thirds of its food rice; the United States unreasonably insisted that Ceylon sell rubber to it at prices lower than market prices, while Ceylon had to buy rice at competitive prices on the U.S. open market. When the Ceylon government "could not agree to blindly obey this embargo, because this would cause a very obvious and unavoidable economic loss to Ceylon," and engaged in equal and mutually beneficial trade with China, the United States rudely exerted continuous pressure on Ceylon, disrupting it from within.
    In India, the United States also used robber-style plunder methods. In 1952, the United States manipulated the grain market, using it to blackmail India, Ceylon, Malaya, and Indonesia, which were short of grain in Southeast Asia, exacerbating India's serious famine disaster; on the other hand, just when India urgently needed funds to import grain, the United States suddenly reduced the quantity of India's main export raw materials such as jute, edible oil rapeseed, tea, pepper, and other items, forcing India to sell at prices 57 percent lower than in 1951.
    The entire Southeast Asian region is also enduring this daylight robbery under the U.S. embargo. When the United States purchased large quantities of strategic materials before and after launching the war of aggression against Korea, it caused a sharp rise in raw material prices in Southeast Asia. For example, the price of tin in early December 1950 was more than two and a half times higher than the average price in 1939; however, since the United States stockpiled a large amount of raw materials and forced the implementation of the embargo, destroying the normal trade between these countries and the democratic world countries, it occupied the monopoly position of the largest buyer, using methods such as reducing purchases, stopping purchases, increasing the production of substitutes, and even selling off to conduct endless price cutting and monopoly of the raw material exports of Southeast Asian countries, causing the prices of these raw materials to plummet, and they still cannot stabilize to this day. For example, rubber dropped from 81 cents per pound in June 1951 to 38 cents in April 1952; the price of tin was suppressed ten times in just five months from April to August 1951, from $1.505 per pound to $1.002 per pound. As a result, Southeast Asian countries suffered significant losses. For example, after Indonesia joined the embargo, it lost 650 million rupiah in foreign exchange in 1951 due to the sharp drop in rubber prices; it also caused rubber-producing people to suffer from unemployment and poverty. Before the embargo, Indonesian rubber workers could earn 1,800 rupiah per month, and after deducting living expenses, rubber wax, and rubber rolling machine rent, they still had an income of 1,000 rupiah, but after the embargo, they could only earn 600 rupiah per month, while living expenses and costs would cost 800 rupiah.
    Therefore, under the dual blow of the U.S. embargo and price suppression, the foreign trade of Southeast Asian countries has to be in an extremely unfavorable situation, with raw material prices constantly falling, exports decreasing sharply, and import surpluses increasing. At the same time, it also makes raw material production increasingly shrink, especially the small farmers' production, which occupies an important position, is drastically reduced. For example, the output of small farmers' rubber in Malaya accounts for more than two-fifths of the country's total rubber output, and its output decreased from more than 270,000 tons in 1951 to more than 240,000 tons in 1952; during the same period, the output of small farmers' rubber in Indonesia also decreased from more than 590,000 tons to more than 440,000 tons, calculated by the quantity of exports. Not only that, although the rubber production of Southeast Asian countries is shrinking day by day, there is still an artificial phenomenon of overproduction. According to a report in the London "Financial Times" on February 12 this year: the world's output of natural rubber in 1952 decreased to 1,762,500 tons, the lowest year since 1949, a decrease of more than 100,000 tons compared with the highest output in 1951; while the consumption during the same period was 1,447,500 tons, which was also the lowest year in the past three years, and this figure includes the import figures of the Soviet Union and China. In this way, the surplus of natural rubber in 1952 reached as high as 315,000 tons.
    Under the threat of this economic disaster, people from all walks of life in Southeast Asian countries are increasingly widely rising up against the U.S. embargo policy. Indonesian Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gondokusumo told reporters that he did not agree with Indonesia supporting the measures taken by the United States and Britain to restrict trade with the People's Republic of China. Indonesian National Enterprise Federation Secretary-General Suryonigoro also said: Indonesia's commercial arena has become silent due to the embargo, and a lot of rubber has been piled up among the Indonesian people. Therefore, "trading with China and selling Indonesia's people's rubber stockpiles is beneficial to the Indonesian people."
    At the ninth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and its second Trade Promotion Conference, held successively from February to March this year, representatives from Asian and Far Eastern countries expressed concern and dissatisfaction with the consequences caused by the plunder and enslavement policies of the United States and other colonial countries. Representatives from India, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Burma all mentioned that the prices of their exported raw materials were extremely low, while the prices of their imported industrial equipment were very high, which hindered the development of their national economies, and unemployment and poverty became more and more serious. A report was also distributed at the meeting, pointing out that the trade of countries in these regions only accounts for 10 to 12 percent of world trade, although their population is nearly half of the world's population. Representatives of many countries also put forward suggestions to promote trade, such as adopting a barter system for trade, and stabilizing world market prices, etc., but these suggestions were opposed by representatives from the United States and Britain. Only the Soviet representative supported and put forward suggestions that were beneficial to the economy and trade of Southeast Asian countries. Soviet representative Nemchinna said at the ninth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East that the Soviet Union is prepared to expand trade with Asian and Far Eastern countries, and is prepared to transport industrial equipment, machinery, and other goods needed for the development of industry, transportation, and agriculture to those countries in exchange for the goods that those countries have always exported, thereby promoting the economic development of those countries. The Soviet representative's speech and suggestions received a wide response. At the second Trade Promotion Conference of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, Soviet representative Kamansky made the same speech. At the meeting of the committee studying the issue of expanding trade, the Soviet representative suggested that the committee's report should point out that if Asian countries can develop trade with the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries, and if countries can conduct trade according to the principles of reciprocity, complete equality, and mutual respect between large and small countries, then the phenomenon of unstable prices in Asia can be alleviated. The committee ignored the opposition of the British and Dutch representatives and adopted this amended suggestion.
    As the U.S. war policy suffers heavier and heavier blows, and as the capitalist economic crisis deepens, the imperialists' transfer, plunder, and enslavement of Southeast Asia and other backward countries will inevitably be strengthened. The previous Washington Conference between the United States and Britain decided to further force countries to strengthen the so-called embargo against China and Korea, which is a signal of further plunder and enslavement of Southeast Asia and other countries. Obviously, there are now only two roads in front of Southeast Asian countries: one road is like Ceylon, refusing to participate in the embargo that violates its own economic interests, increasing equal and mutually beneficial trade with China and the democratic world market, so that it can get rid of the shackles of further plunder and enslavement by U.S. monopoly capital, and move towards the future of economic development; the other road is to continue to succumb to U.S. pressure, accept the U.S. embargo policy, and let the United States monopolize and dominate, so that it will fall into a deeper disaster of a colonial nature. However, we believe that in these countries, all democratic forces that truly love peace and demand independence and autonomy will eventually rise up to oppose this malicious conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists.

    美国禁运政策危害了东南亚国家的利益
    胡今
    美国强加于资本主义世界各国特别是东南亚国家的所谓禁运政策，使这些国家不能与民主和平阵营各国进行平等互利贸易，蒙受了极大的损害，便利了美国操纵这些国家的对外贸易，并对它们进行掠夺和奴役。
    一九五一——一九五二年，亚洲和远东许多国家发生了对外贸易恶化、入超增加和外汇储备金减少的现象。亚洲和远东十个国家在一九五一年上半年出超七亿四千八百万美元，但到了一九五二年同时期内的贸易就入超约为八亿七千六百万美元了。印度在一九五二年八个月中的贸易逆差，即达七亿九千万卢比。印尼由一九五一年的出超印尼币十亿多盾变为一九五二年的入超十六亿多盾。锡兰在一九五二年四个月内出口低于进口百分之五，而前年同一时期出口则高于进口百分之十六。马来亚的情况也很严重，一九五二年上半年的输出额较上年同期减少百分之四十一，从出超九亿八千万元叻币迅速逆转为入超三千二百万元叻币。
    这些国家的对外贸易为什么会发生这样重大的逆转呢？
    当然，基本的原因是：这些长期遭受帝国主义统治和榨取的国家，一直就是原料产地和殖民国家推销货物的市场。第二次世界大战后，资本主义世界市场更形缩小，英法荷殖民国家独占资本都加强了对这些国家的压榨，美国独占资本更是四处伸张魔爪，使东南亚和其他殖民地国家一样陷于更加深重的经济灾难中。据“国际市场”杂志一九五二年二月号说：落后国家提供了美国进口货百分之五十七，又消费了美国出口货的百分之四十四。同时，西欧国家也有百分之七十四的出口货是输出到落后国家的，而英法荷等殖民国家垄断了东南亚和其他许多落后国家的原料出口。落后国家这种对外贸易的殖民地性质和不等价交换，即落后国家输出低价的原料，购进高价的工业品，而受着帝国主义国家残酷的剥削，这是谁都知道的事实。据估计，由于用高价向美国购买制成品，并用低价向美国卖出原料的结果，在一九五二年上半年，亚洲和远东各国对美贸易入超达二亿三千五百万美元；同期对英贸易入超也达一亿三千二百万美元。
    但是，目前美国和其他殖民国家对东南亚各国的掠夺，是和它们在资本主义总危机加深的基础上推行的战争政策分不开的；而美国强迫各国执行的所谓禁运政策，就是它的战争政策的一部分，或者可说是美国强迫各国提供资源和市场来为美国战争政策服务的一种横暴手段。正是这种禁运政策，更加恶化了东南亚国家对外贸易的情况。
    美国总统依照所谓国际开发法而任命的“国际开发顾问委员会”，曾在一九五一年三月的第一次报告中说：“我们愈深入研究（落后区域）经济发展对防务的关系，我们就愈感到它们的真正不可分开”。该报告并强调了这样的事实：“……实际上所有天然橡胶、锰、铬和锡以及我们四分之一的锌和铜，三分之一或三分之一以上的铅和铝，都来自国外，多半来自开发不足区域。绝大部分的铅砂，也是如此。在军事上十分重要而包括在囤积物资之内的进口物中，其总值的百分之七十三来自这些区域”。以东南亚地区来说，由于长期附属于殖民帝国主义的结果，东南亚各国工业极为落后，有许多国家根本谈不到建立工业，而只畸形地发展着单一性的原料生产。目前东南亚各国这些原料如天然橡胶、锡、锰、黄麻、石油、云母等的大量出产，成了美国储备战略原料及每年输入工业原料的重要来源，如美国在一九五○年输入的天然橡胶百分之九十七点二来自东南亚，同期美国输入炼锡的百分之六十四点八来自马来亚，美国所需黄麻及其制品均从巴基斯坦和印度输入，一九四九年美国自印度输入的锰占其总输入额的百分之二十九点四，菲律宾所产椰子油占世界产量的百分之九十七，为美国历年用以制甘油（炸药原料）、肥皂和人造胶所需椰油的全部来源。
    因此，美国为了垄断东南亚的原料供应和商品销售市场为其备战经济服务，除了强迫英法荷殖民国家开放东南亚市场，并以“第四点计划”及其他
    “经济援助”向东南亚各国大量投资，企图取代英法荷帝国主义的统治地位以外，美国胁迫东南亚各国参加禁运，隔断它们与民主世界各国的贸易，以便它更进一步地对东南亚国家进行强盗式的经济掠夺和政治控制。正如周恩来总理所指出的：“美国政府正在利用其‘封锁’‘禁运’政策来干涉其他国家的内政、外交和通商贸易政策，破坏世界市场的正常关系，企图独占某些原料和销售市场，扩张美国军事基地，以便操纵这些国家的经济命脉和政治生活。”
    最近锡兰政府发表的声明，就更加充分地暴露了美国禁运政策的这一掠夺性质。锡兰每年收入的三分之一是靠橡胶的输出，同时则需输入民食三分之二的大米；美国竟无理坚持要锡兰以低于市场价格的价格卖橡胶给它，而锡兰却要在美国公开市场上以竞争价格购买大米。当锡兰政府“不能同意盲目服从这个禁运，因为这会给锡兰以十分明显的不可避免的经济损失”，而与中国进行平等互利的贸易时，美国便粗暴地对锡兰不断施以压力，从中破坏。
    在印度，美国也使用了强盗式的掠夺手段。一九五二年美国一面操纵了粮食市场，藉以对东南亚粮食不足的印度、锡兰、马来亚和印尼等国进行敲诈，加深了印度严重的饥荒灾情；另一方面正当印度迫切需要款项以输入粮食的时候，美国突然减少了购买印度主要输出原料黄麻、食油菜籽、茶、胡椒及其他物品的数量，迫使印度以低于一九五一年价格百分之五十七的价格出售。
    整个东南亚国家也都正在忍受着美国在禁运下的这种白昼行劫。美国在发动侵朝战争前后搜购大量战略物资时，曾造成东南亚原料价格的猛涨，如一九五○年十二月初的锡价比一九三九年平均价上涨了两倍半以上；但自从美国囤积了大量原料，并强迫实施禁运，破坏了这些国家与民主世界各国的正常贸易后，它便居于最大买主的垄断地位，以减购、停购、增产代用品、甚至是抛售的手段，对东南亚国家的原料输出进行无止境的杀价和垄断，使这些原料的价格一落千丈，直到现在还不能稳定。如橡胶从一九五一年六月的每磅八角一分美元降低到一九五二年四月的三角八分；锡价仅在一九五一年四月至八月的短短五个月内，就被压低十次，由每磅的一·五○五美元降到一·○○二美元。结果，东南亚各国遭受了重大的损失，如印尼参加禁运后，由于橡胶价格的暴跌，在一九五一年就损失了六亿五千万盾的外汇；同时也使生产橡胶的人民遭受失业和贫穷，印尼橡胶工人在禁运前每人每月可得一千八百盾的收入，扣去生活费、胶腊和辗胶车租外，还有一千盾的收入，但禁运后他们每月只能有六百盾的收入，而生活费和成本就要支出八百盾。
    因此，在美国禁运和压价的双重打击下，东南亚国家的对外贸易就不能不处于极端不利的情势，原料不断跌价，出口激减，入超增加。同时，并使原料生产日益萎缩下来，特别是占有重要地位的小农生产剧烈减少，如马来亚小农橡胶产量占全国橡胶产量的五分之二以上，其产量由一九五一年的二十七万余吨，减少到一九五二年的二十四万余吨；同期印尼小农橡胶产量以输出数量计算，也由五十九万余吨减为四十四万余吨。不仅这样，东南亚国家的橡胶生产虽然日益萎缩，仍然发生了人为的生产过剩现象。据伦敦“金融时报”今年二月十二日报道：天然橡胶一九五二年的世界产量减到一、七六二、五○○吨，为一九四九年以来最低的一年，较一九五一年最高产量减产十万多吨；而同期的消费量为一、四四七、五○○吨，也是三年来最低的一年，且此项数字内，尚包括苏联和中国的进口数字。这样，产销相抵，一九五二年天然橡胶的剩余数达三十一万五千吨之多。
    在这种经济灾难的威胁下，东南亚国家各阶层人士，越来越广泛地起来反对美国的禁运政策。印尼国会外交委员会主席龚多古苏莫对记者表示，他不同意印尼支持美国和英国所采取的限制对中华人民共和国的贸易的措施。印尼民族企业联合机构秘书长苏约尼哥罗也说：印尼的商场因为禁运而变得沉寂，印尼民间已经堆积了很多存胶，因此，“和中国通商，卖出印尼的民间存胶是对印尼人有利的。”
    在今年二月至三月间先后举行的联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第九届会议，及其第二届贸易促进会议上，亚洲和远东国家的代表，对美国和其他殖民国家的掠夺和奴役政策所造成的后果，表现了忧虑和不满的情绪。印度、印尼、锡兰和缅甸等国代表都谈到，他们出口的原料价格极其低廉，而他们进口的工业设备价格却很高，使他们的国民经济的发展受到阻碍，失业和贫穷愈来愈严重。会上还散发了一份报告书，指出在这些地区的国家的贸易只占到世界贸易的百分之十到十二，虽然他们的人口将近世界人口的一半。许多国家的代表还提出了促进贸易的建议，如采用以货易货制来进行贸易，和稳定世界市场价格等等，但这些建议都遭到了美国和英国代表的反对。只有苏联代表支持和提出了对东南亚各国经济和贸易上有利的建议。苏联代表涅姆钦纳在联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第九届会议上说：苏联准备和亚洲及远东各国扩大贸易，准备把工业设备、机器以及发展工业、运输业和农业所需要的其他货物运到那些国家，以交换那些国家一向输出的货物，从而促进那些国家的经济发展。苏联代表的发言和建议，得到了广泛的反应。在亚洲和远东经济委员会第二届贸易促进会议上，苏联代表卡曼斯基作了同样的发言。在研究扩展贸易问题的委员会会议上，苏联代表建议委员会的报告书应该指出，如果亚洲国家能够发展和苏联、中国以及各人民民主国家的贸易，如果各国能按照大小国家间互惠、完全平等和互相尊重的原则进行贸易，那么亚洲物价不稳定的现象是可以减轻的。委员会不顾英国和荷兰代表的反对，通过了这项修正建议。
    随着美国战争政策遭到越来越沉重的打击，随着资本主义经济危机的深刻化，帝国主义者对东南亚和其他落后国家的转嫁、掠夺和奴役，势必日益加强。前此美英华盛顿会议决定进一步强迫各国加强对中国和朝鲜的所谓禁运，就是对东南亚和其他国家进一步掠夺和奴役的信号。显然，现在摆在东南亚国家面前的只有两条道路：一条道路是像锡兰那样，拒绝参加违反本国经济利益的禁运，与中国和民主世界市场增进平等互利的贸易，这样就会使自己摆脱美国独占资本进一步掠夺和奴役的枷锁，走向发展经济的前途；另一条道路是继续屈从美国的压力，接受美国的禁运政策，听任美国垄断和宰割，这样就会使自己陷于更深重的殖民地性质的灾难中。但是，我们相信，在这些国家中，一切真正爱好和平、要求独立自主的民主力量，终究会起来反对美国帝国主义者这种恶毒阴谋的。
