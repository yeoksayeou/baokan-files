In some areas of North China, East China, Northeast China, and Central South China, the tendency to blindly expand the planting area of industrial raw material crops is still serious. In Shanxi Province, economic crop areas have been expanded in more than ten of the fifty-one counties and cities. For example, the cotton field area in Xin County increased by 66% compared to last year, the oil crop area in Tianzhen County increased by 216%, and the hemp field area in Shuo County increased by 137%. In the suburbs of Tianjin, 14,000 mu of cotton were planted last year, and another 3,000 to 4,000 mu will be added this year. In Hebei Province, there is a general trend of expanding cotton fields; the Shijiazhuang area alone requires an expansion of 30,000 mu of cotton fields. According to a report by Qiu Youwen, Vice Chairman of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, at the Fifth Provincial Congress of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives, the cotton fields in the province will increase from 190,000 hectares in 1952 to 200,000 hectares in 1953. Jiangsu Province blindly expanded cotton fields last year, and there is a tendency to continue to expand this year. The mutual aid teams in Haimen County, which have already made plans, are all planning to expand cotton fields by an average of more than one-third compared to last year. The He Yongning mutual aid team in Jiangning County plans to increase the cotton planting area by more than six times this year compared to last year. Xinghua, Shuyang, Huaiyin and other counties are not suitable for cotton planting, but many farmers are planning to switch to cotton or expand cotton fields this year. Last year, Puan Township in Jingjiang County converted more than one-third of the township's grain fields to cotton, and plans to continue to expand this year. A survey of 177 farmers in Changshu County showed that the average cotton field area will be expanded by 20% compared to last year. In Henan Province, there is a trend of blindly expanding tobacco fields. In Xuchang County, a major tobacco producing area, tobacco fields in some districts and townships have been expanded by two-fifths to three-fifths, and in some townships, tobacco fields have even been expanded by one to two times. Agricultural leading organs and rural cadres in various localities should take appropriate measures to advise farmers to stabilize the planting area of economic crops. Otherwise, the increase in grain production will be hindered.
    In addition, some farmers in individual areas have blindly reduced the cotton planting area. This is because local cadres did not correctly publicize the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council on the cotton-grain price ratio to the masses; in addition, this year, cooperatives no longer pre-purchase cotton, and the masses mistakenly believe that the state will no longer purchase cotton. Except for individual areas where too much cotton was planted last year and individual areas that are indeed not suitable for cotton planting but were planted with cotton should appropriately reduce the cotton field area, the cotton planting area should be stabilized in general areas, and attention should be paid to further leading and helping cotton farmers to increase the yield per unit area.

    山西、河北、江苏、河南等省
    许多地区盲目扩大经济作物种植面积
    华北、华东、东北、中南有些地区盲目扩大工业原料作物种植面积的倾向仍然严重。山西省五十一县、市中，有十余县经济作物面积扩大了。如忻县棉田面积比去年增加百分之六十六，天镇县油料作物面积增加了百分之二百一十六，朔县麻田面积增加了百分之一百三十七；天津市郊区去年种棉一万四千亩，今年又要增加三千亩到四千亩。河北省普遍有扩大棉田的趋势，只石家庄专区就要求扩大棉田三万亩。据辽西省人民政府副主席仇友文在全省第五次农业劳动模范代表大会上报告，该省一九五三年棉田将由一九五二年的十九万垧增加到二十万垧。江苏各地去年就盲目扩大了棉田，今年有继续扩大的趋向。海门县已订计划的互助组，平均都计划比去年扩大棉田三分之一以上；江宁县何永宁互助组今年计划种棉面积比去年增加六倍多；兴化、沭阳、淮阴等县都不是适宜种棉的地区，许多农民今年也打算改种棉花或扩大棉田；靖江县普安乡去年就把全乡三分之一以上的粮田改种了棉花，今年还准备继续扩大；常熟县调查了一百七十七户农民，平均棉田要比去年扩大百分之二十。河南省有盲目扩大烟田的趋势，主要产烟地区许昌县部分区、乡烟田扩大了五分之二到五分之三，有些乡的烟田甚至扩大了一倍到两倍。各地农业领导机关和广大农村干部应当采取适当的措施，劝告农民稳定经济作物种植面积。不然，粮食的增产就会受到妨碍。
    此外，个别地区也有些农民盲目地缩小了植棉面积。这是因为当地干部没有把政务院财政经济委员会关于棉粮比价的指示向群众进行正确的宣传；加以今年合作社不再预购棉花，群众误认为国家不再收购棉花了。除了去年确实种棉过多和确实不宜种棉而种了棉花的个别地区应当适当的缩减棉田面积之外，一般地区还应稳定植棉面积，并注意进一步领导和帮助棉农提高单位面积产量。
