    Personnel from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute
    Go Deep into Rural Areas to Serve Production
    According to the working principle of "Orienting towards Production, Going Deep into Rural Areas," the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute has determined to focus on Shanxi and Hebei provinces this year, conducting zonal investigations and research on cotton and wheat varieties and their cultivation methods. On the one hand, it will study important issues such as close planting, fertilization, and prevention of cotton boll and bud drop. On the other hand, it will gradually carry out the regionalization of cotton and wheat varieties and their cultivation methods. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, together with the agricultural and forestry departments of the Shanxi and Hebei provincial people's governments, the heads of the experimental farms of the two provinces, and relevant experts, have organized agricultural high-yield trial research work committees in each province to lead the trial research work at each base point. Recently, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute has dispatched fifty researchers to rural areas in Shanxi and Hebei provinces to carry out work.
    This work is a major reform in the work of the North China Agricultural Research Institute. For the past three years, there has been a serious tendency to be divorced from reality in the work of the institute. Researchers have been conducting so-called "advanced research" in laboratories, isolated from agricultural production. During the "Three-Anti" movement last year, researchers criticized bourgeois viewpoints and the reactionary theories of Mendel and Morgan. From October last year to February this year, many researchers also participated in the Michurin breeding training class organized by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. Last autumn, Chen Fengtong, director of the institute, returned from a visit to the Soviet Union and conveyed reports on the working principles and methods of advanced agricultural science in the Soviet Union within the institute. On this basis, the institute launched a reform of scientific research, determined a new working principle and research goal of connecting with reality and serving production.

    华北农业科学研究所人员
    深入农村为生产服务
    华北农业科学研究所根据“面向生产、深入农村”的工作方针，今年确定以山西、河北两省为重点，分区进行棉花、小麦品种及其栽培法的调查研究工作。一方面研究密植、施肥及防止棉花落蕾落铃等重要问题，另一方面逐步开展棉花、小麦品种及其栽培法的区域化工作。华北农业科学研究所与山西、河北两省人民政府的农林厅、两省的实验农场的负责人以及有关的专家组织了各该省的农业丰产试验研究工作委员会，领导各基点进行试验研究工作。最近华北农业科学研究所已派出五十名研究人员分赴山西、河北两省农村中开展工作。
    这一工作是华北农业研究所工作上的重大改革。该所三年来工作中一直存在着严重的脱离实际的倾向，研究人员都在试验室里孤立地进行和农业生产脱节的所谓“高级研究”。去年“三反”运动中，研究人员批判了资产阶级观点和孟德尔、摩尔根的反动学说。从去年十月到今年二月，许多研究人员又参加了中央人民政府农业部主办的米丘林育种训练班。去年秋天，该所所长陈凤桐访苏归来，将苏联的先进农业科学的工作方针方法在所内作了传达报告。在这个基础上，该所展开了科学研究的改革工作，确定了联系实际、为生产服务的新工作方针和研究目标。（新华社）
