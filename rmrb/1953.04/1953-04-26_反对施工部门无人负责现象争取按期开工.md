A short commentary:

    Correctly launching the struggle against waste and irresponsibility in basic construction is an important step to ensure that this year's basic construction projects are done quickly, well, and economically. The experience of the Northeast's responsibility system movement last year proved this point, and the experience of the Fourth Engineering Company of the Non-Ferrous Metals Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in launching a struggle against irresponsibility to promote construction preparation work, published in today's newspaper, also proves this.

    However, some people think that carrying out this movement "has no factual basis." For example: "We are a newly established engineering company, there is no waste or irresponsibility." Yes, many engineering companies this year are new teams, but precisely because they are new teams with insufficient manpower and experience, there may be more loopholes in the preparation of the project, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible may be more serious. The relationship between Party A and Party B is unclear, and many things are passed back and forth between them. Some have not even signed a contract today. Isn't this irresponsibility? Materials and tools are not prepared, or are not prepared completely. Isn't this irresponsibility? There is no project progress plan, no construction organization design. Isn't this irresponsibility? Are these situations merely isolated phenomena in individual departments? It is very clear that if these departments do not quickly establish economic accounting thinking among their employees and establish a responsibility system, serious waste will inevitably occur in this year's construction.

    Some say: "There is waste, and a responsibility system must be established, but what is more important now is to rush the start of construction." Yes, the primary task of the construction engineering department is to strive for on-schedule commencement. Currently, many projects are delayed due to changes in tasks, untimely design, and insufficient material preparation, resulting in serious idle work. Failure to seize the time to start construction as soon as possible and reduce idle work is a great waste. But the question is how to do it quickly, economically, and well. Currently, the reason why many projects cannot start, in addition to several external reasons such as changes in plans, from the perspective of the engineering department, the key lies in the unsound organization, unclear responsibilities, and the fact that no one is responsible for many preparatory tasks. If these phenomena are not exposed and a responsibility system is not established, even if construction starts, it will still have to stop. If the engineering company is not idle, there will still be idle work on the construction site. Workers at the Jinan Workers' and Peasants' Quick Completion Normal School construction site of the Shandong Construction Engineering Company entered the construction site on March 6, but due to insufficient preparation, it was not officially started until the end of March. The average worker on the company’s project which started in March worked for less than eight days. In other places where construction has already started, the phenomena of stopping work to wait for drawings, stopping work to wait for materials, and stopping work to wait for technicians are also extremely common and serious. This shows that it is wrong to oppose the unfolding of the struggle against waste and irresponsibility against the current construction preparation work or rushing to start construction.

    The Fourth Engineering Company of the Non-Ferrous Metals Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in conjunction with construction preparation work, initially checked the phenomena of waste and irresponsibility. After the inspection, they held professional meetings, established various responsibility systems, corrected the waiting and dependent thinking and the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and greatly promoted the construction preparation work. This experience is worth emulating in various places.

### 反对施工部门无人负责现象争取按期开工

    反对施工部门无人负责现象争取按期开工
    正确地开展基本建设中反对浪费反对无人负责现象的斗争，是保证今年基本建设工程做到又快又好又省的重要步骤之一。东北去年建立责任制运动的经验证明了这一点，今天本报发表的重工业部有色金属管理局第四工程公司开展反无人负责现象斗争推动了施工准备工作的经验也证明了这一点。
    可是，有的人认为搞这个运动“没有事实根据”。譬如说：“我们是新成立的工程公司，没有浪费和无人负责的事实。”是的，今年有不少的工程公司都是新班子，但正因为是新班子，人力和经验都不足，因此在工程的准备工作中漏洞可能更多，无人负责的现象也可能更严重。甲方与乙方关系不明，许多事情互相推诿，有的到今天包工合同还没有签订，这不是无人负责吗？材料、工具没有准备，或者准备得不齐全，这不是无人负责吗？没有工程进度计划，没有施工组织设计，这不是无人负责吗？难道这些情况只是个别部门的个别现象吗？很显然的，这些部门假如不迅速在职工中树立经济核算思想，建立责任制度，今年工程建设中就必然会产生严重的浪费。
    有的说：“浪费是有的，责任制也要建立，但是目前更重要的是赶开工。”是的，建筑工程部门当前首要的任务就是争取按期开工。目前许多工程由于任务变动，设计不及时，材料准备不充分，因而延误工期，发生严重的窝工现象，如不争取时间及早开工，减少窝工，就是极大浪费。但是问题在于如何做法才能既快，又省，又好。目前许多工程之所以不能开工，除了计划变动等若干外部原因之外，从工程部门看来，机构不健全、职责不明、许多准备工作无人负责是关键所在。不揭发这些现象，不建立责任制度，即使开工了，还得停工；工程公司不窝工了，到工地里还会窝工。山东建筑工程公司济南工农速成师范工地工人于三月六日就进入工地，因为准备工作不充分，拖到三月底还未正式动工。全公司三月份开工的工程，平均每个工人做工不足八天。其他各地业已开工的工地，停工待图、停工待料、停工待技工等现象也极为普遍而严重。这说明，如果把展开反对浪费和无人负责现象的斗争，同当前施工准备工作或赶开工等对立起来是错误的。
    重工业部有色金属管理局第四工程公司结合施工准备工作，初步检查浪费现象和无人负责现象，检查之后，召开专业会议，建立了各种责任制，纠正了等待依赖思想和无人负责现象，大大地推进了施工准备工作，这个经验值得各地仿效。
