Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the 10th, bookstores in cities across the country began selling "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III, amidst the eager anticipation of the people.

Many Xinhua bookstores in various cities had made careful arrangements before the 10th, displaying a solemn and grand atmosphere. Long before the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III, people in many areas were already inquiring about the date of sale. On the morning of the 10th, many people were already waiting outside bookstores before they opened. Many organizations and schools in Beijing adopted the method of collective purchase; Renmin University of China bought 3,000 copies at once. Before the business hours of the Fuzhou branch of Xinhua Bookstore, both its outlets were crowded with people buying books. Dozens of sample copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III, displayed on the bookshelves of the Nantai outlet of the branch, were all borrowed and read by people who came to buy books. The Anshan Xinhua Bookstore received more than 170 phone calls within two hours, from 7 a.m. to the opening time, all inquiring about book purchase procedures. On the 10th, heavy snow was falling in Lanzhou, but a large number of cadres and commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were still waiting in front of the Xinhua Bookstore early in the morning. People in the suburbs of Tianjin braved the strong wind to come to the city to buy books. In Shanghai, it was raining heavily early in the morning, but many people braved the rain to go to bookstores to buy books. In Xi'an, it rained all day on the 10th, but the Xinhua Bookstore and China Book Company were crowded with people waiting to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III before they even started business in the morning.

The Xinhua Bookstore in Beijing sold more than 14,000 copies in one day on the 10th. As of 4 p.m., Shenyang had sold more than 5,900 copies. Shanghai had sold a total of more than 4,300 copies by 5 p.m. Incomplete statistics from Nanjing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Nanchang, and other cities showed that more than 8,000 copies were sold in one day.

To celebrate the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau convened a meeting on the morning of the 10th. Li Fanfu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, briefly introduced the contents of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III and elaborated on Chairman Mao's theoretical contributions in opposing subjectivism and dogmatism. More than 800 cadres from the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, the Central-South Administrative Committee, the CCP Wuhan Municipal Committee, and the CCP Hubei Provincial Committee attended the lecture. On the same day, the Yangtze Daily published an editorial entitled: "Learning the Style of Seeking Truth from Facts and the Method of Investigation and Research." The editorial called on people to learn Chairman Mao's spirit of seeking truth from facts and the method of investigation and research to oppose bureaucracy. The Hubei Daily's editorial stated in the last paragraph: Leading cadres at all levels must make unremitting efforts to strengthen their mass viewpoint and closely link with the masses by studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, thereby improving themselves and improving their leadership methods and working methods. The Yangtze Daily and Hubei Daily also published Li Fanfu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau's "Experience of Re-reading Comrade Mao Zedong's 'Reform Our Study'" and Xu Maoyong's reflections on reading "Study and the Current Situation."

The Shenyang branch of Xinhua Bookstore convened labor models, combat heroes, and members of democratic parties who came to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III in the bookstore's conference room on the morning of the 10th for a forum to discuss their experiences in studying Volumes I and II of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The famous labor model Jiang Wanshou said at the forum: After studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," I understood the importance of relying on the masses. We relied on the masses, which improved product quality and production efficiency. In order to do a good job in the distribution of Volume III, the Fujian branch of Xinhua Bookstore specially convened a meeting of managers of branches in various special districts (cities) a few days ago to summarize the experience in the distribution of Volumes I and II. The staff of the Fuzhou branch voluntarily sacrificed their rest time on the evenings of the 8th and 9th, working until midnight, checking and packaging books, and arranging shop windows, so that "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III could be sold in Fuzhou as scheduled.
