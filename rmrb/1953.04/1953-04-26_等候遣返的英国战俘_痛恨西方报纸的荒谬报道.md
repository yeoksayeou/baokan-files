Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, April 25th: According to a report from Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," from Kaesong on the 24th: Today I chatted with a sergeant of the Gloucestershire Regiment among the British soldiers waiting for repatriation in Kaesong. He bitterly resented the absurd reports in Western newspapers about "atrocities." He said, "It is really bad for the relatives of those who are still in the POW camps to hear such ridiculous things. It is very important that we should tell the truth about the treatment we received there. We were never mistreated, and the food we ate was never worse than what our guards ate. This is my experience, and it is the experience of all the British soldiers I have met."

This sergeant, like all the POWs I have met, was very happy to hear the news that the negotiations were definitely going to resume on the 26th. He said, "We are very happy to be able to go home, but we are very reluctant to leave so many friends."

As I was about to leave, one of his friends (also from the Gloucestershire Regiment) said, "There is one thing that both of us want to say: we are very grateful for the excellent treatment we received from the Koreans all the way when we came here. We couldn't have slept better, and the Korean army and people were very considerate of us. I would also like to point out that the Chinese People's Volunteers have always been so friendly to us. It is a shameless trick to fabricate rumors about the situation in the POW camps, causing pain to the families of the prisoners."

    等候遣返的英国战俘
    痛恨西方报纸的荒谬报道
    【新华社二十五日讯】据伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十四日自板门店报道：今天我和正在开城等候遣返的英国士兵中的一个格罗斯特团上士闲谈。他非常痛恨西方报纸关于“暴行”的荒谬报道，他说：“当那些还留在战俘营里的人的亲属们听到这种荒唐话后，实在是很不好的，我们应该把我们在那里受到的待遇的真相说出来，这是很重要的。我们从来没有受过虐待，并且我们吃的食物，也没有一次是比看守我们的卫兵所吃的东西差些，这是我的经验，也是我所遇到过的所有英国兵的经验。”
    这个上士和我所遇到过的所有战俘一样，很高兴听到关于谈判确要在二十六日恢复的消息。他说：“我们很高兴能够回家，但是我们很舍不得离开这么许多朋友。”
    当我要离开时，他的一个朋友（也是格罗斯特团的）说：“有一件事是我们两个人都要说的：我们非常感激，当我们到这里来时，一路上朝鲜人对我们的优良的待遇。我们睡得再好也没有，朝鲜军队和人民都是非常体贴我们的。我还要指出，中国人民志愿军对我们一直是那么友善。对我们在战俘营中的情形进行造谣，使俘虏的家属们痛苦，这实在是一种无耻的勾当。”
