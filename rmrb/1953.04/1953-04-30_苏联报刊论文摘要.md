Collectivity is the Highest Principle of Party Leadership

The "Pravda" published an article by Sliepov on April 16 entitled "Collectivity is the Highest Principle of Party Leadership," excerpts of which are as follows:

The collectivity in resolving all the most important issues of the Party's work is one of the fundamental principles of the Party's leadership.

The principle of collectivity in work primarily means that the resolution of all important principled issues by the Party Committee is the result of collective discussion. Because no matter how experienced the leaders are, no matter what knowledge and abilities they have, they cannot replace the initiative and experience of the entire collective.

The correct conduct of the Standing Committee and plenary sessions of the Party Committee plays an important role in collective discussion and resolution of problems. When the Party criticizes certain staff for leadership meetings, it does not mean that the Party is criticizing meetings. On the contrary, infrequent meetings of the Standing Committee and plenary sessions of the Party Committee precisely undermine the collectivity of leadership and replace collective leadership with commandism, red tape, and bureaucratic methods. The question is not entirely about holding meetings, but about how the meetings are held.

Passing important resolutions through the method of soliciting opinions is one of the methods of undermining the collectivity of leadership. Important resolutions passed by soliciting opinions will not have practical effects, but only prove a formalistic and bureaucratic attitude towards things. Of course, some issues that do not need discussion can be adopted by soliciting opinions. The method of soliciting opinions will undermine the collectivity of leadership, reduce the basic rights of members in the leading collective, and weaken their sense of responsibility for the entire work of the collective.

Poor preparation for meetings, that is, submitting unprepared issues to the Standing Committee of the Party Committee, and not allowing the Standing Committee members to obtain materials and familiarize themselves with the draft resolutions of the meeting in advance, is one of the most popular forms of undermining collectivity. In this case, the meeting lasts for several hours, but no clear decision is reached. This kind of unproductive meeting can only weaken the significance of collectivity.

Collectivity in work means that leaders can listen to the opinions of members of the Party Committee, value their criticisms and suggestions. Leaders cannot regard criticism of themselves as a personal insult. They should be good at bravely accepting criticism and be prepared to subordinate their will to the will of the collective.

Collectivity in work is of great significance for the education of cadres. Cultivating strict political leaders without collectivity is inconceivable.

The collectivity of discussion and resolution of problems should be correctly combined with personal responsibility in the implementation of resolutions. Resolutions that do not specify who is responsible or set a completion date are in the nature of mere wishes and empty declarations. Even the implementation and inspection of such resolutions is impossible. It should not only be said that such resolutions are useless, but that they are harmful. Because this will lead to a phenomenon of no one being responsible and disintegrate discipline.

More Fully Utilize the Potential of Local Industry

The "Pravda" published an article on April 11 by Maritsev, Minister of Light Industry of the Khabarovsk Krai Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, pointing out the vigorous development of local industry and industrial production cooperatives in the region, while pointing out some existing shortcomings, excerpts of which are as follows:

In ensuring the continuous improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people and better satisfying their growing material needs and demands, our large number of local industrial enterprises and industrial cooperative enterprises should play a major role. However, we are far from utilizing the potential strength of these enterprises. Local industry and industrial cooperative enterprises still cannot meet the growing material needs of residents. This is primarily because they have not yet fully utilized their own region's richest resources: wood, clay, mineral pigments, quartz, marble, etc. In the total product value of enterprises of local industry and cooperative industry in our region, products manufactured using local raw materials currently account for only 30 percent.

Failure to fully utilize one's own raw material resources, relying on the import of raw materials from other states, often prevents our local industrial enterprises and cooperative industrial enterprises from completing their production tasks, but in some places in our region, this very wrong idea of dependence is still prevalent. Some other leaders try to use the excuse of insufficient raw materials to defend their incompetence, while they are unwilling to actively seek this raw material locally. They tolerate the phenomenon of plans not being completed and technical operating procedures being unattended to, allow low labor productivity and unprofitable enterprises.

The uneven distribution of enterprises of local industry and cooperative industry throughout the region is a major shortcoming in their development. We have not given due attention to the natural resources of Kamchatka, the Koryak National Okrug and the Chukotka National Okrug, the Lower Amur Oblast and other places. At the same time, until now, we have not established a solid raw material supply base needed for the manufacture of many important foods.

These major shortcomings prove that many leaders of local industry and industrial cooperatives in our Khabarovsk Krai are superficially engaged in their work. They do not specifically lead the various enterprises, do not provide assistance to the enterprises in organizing workers' labor and maximizing the use of machinery and equipment. These leaders pay little attention to studying technical and production conditions, do not care about the correct calculation of material consumption, and do not make rapid solutions to the problems they face.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    集体性是党的领导的最高原则
    “真理报”四月十六日发表了斯列波夫以“集体性是党的领导的最高原则”为题的论文，摘要如下：
    解决党的工作的一切最重要问题的集体性，是党的领导的基本原则之一。
    工作中的集体性原则，首先是指党委会通过的有关一切重要原则问题的解决是集体讨论的成果。因为无论领导者多么有经验，无论他们有什么样的知识和能力，也不能代替整个集体的倡议和经验。
    党委会的常委会和全体会议的正确进行，在集体讨论和解决问题方面，起着重要的作用。当党因领导会议的原故而批评某些工作人员的时候，这并不是说党在指责会议。相反，党委会的常委会和党委会全会举行会议的不经常，正是破坏领导的集体性，以命令主义和文牍主义及官僚主义的方法来代替集体领导。问题完全不在于开会，而在于会议是怎样开的。
    以征询意见的方法通过重要决议，是对领导的集体性的破坏方法之一。以征询方法通过的重要决议不会有实际效果，只是证明了对待事情的形式主义和官僚主义的态度。当然，有一部分不需要讨论的问题是可以采用征询意见的方法的。征询意见的方法，会破坏领导的集体性，减低领导集体中的成员的基本权利，削弱他们对集体的全部工作的责任感。
    会议准备得不好，即把没有准备过的问题提交党委会的常委会，不使常委会委员事先获得材料和熟悉该会议的决议草案，是破坏集体性最流行的一种形式。在这种情况中，会议延续数小时，然而得不到明确的决定，这种没有成果的会议，只能削弱集体性的意义。
    工作中的集体性是要使领导者能听取党委会委员的意见，重视他们的批评意见和建议。领导者不能把对自己的批评认为是个人的侮辱。他们应善于勇敢地接受批评，善于准备把自己的意志服从于集体的意志。
    工作中的集体性对于干部的教育具有重大意义。培养严正的政治领导者如果没有集体性是不可思议的。
    讨论和解决问题的集体性，应当与执行决议中的个人责任正确地结合起来。没有确定负责人或完成日期的决议，具有单纯愿望和空洞宣言的性质，执行和检查这种决议甚至是不可能的。不能只简单地说这种决议是没有益处的，应当说是有害的。因为这会造成无人负责现象，瓦解纪律。更充分地利用地方工业的潜力
    “真理报”四月十一日发表了苏联共产党伯力边疆区区委会轻工业部部长马里采夫的论文，指出该区地方工业和工业生产合作社的蓬勃发展，同时指出现存的一些缺点，摘要如下：在保证经常地提高苏联人民的生活水平，更好地满足他们增长着的物质需要和要求方面，我们大量的地方工业企业和工业合作社企业应当起重大的作用。但是，我们还远没有利用这些企业的潜在力量。地方工业和工业合作社的企业仍不能满足居民增长着的物质生活要求。这首先是由于它们还没有充分利用自己边疆区的最丰富的资源：木材、黏土、矿物颜料、石英、大理石等的缘故。在我区地方工业和合作社工业的企业的产品总额中，目前用本地原料制造的产品还仅占百分之三十。
    不充分利用自己的原料资源，依赖自其他各州输入原料，使我们的地方工业企业和合作社工业企业时常不能完成自己的生产任务，可是在我们边疆区里有的地方还流行着这种十分错误的依赖思想。另外一些领导人企图用原料不足为借口替自己的无能作辩护，同时他们却不愿主动地在本地去寻找这种原料。他们容忍计划不能完成和技术操作过程无人照管的现象，容许劳动生产率低下和企业不能赢利的情况。
    地方工业和合作社工业的企业在全边疆区分布的不均匀，是它们发展的一个主要缺点。我们对于堪察加，柯列克斯克民族州和楚克池士民族州，下阿穆尔州等地的天然富源，还没有给予应有的注意。同时，截至现在为止，我们还没有建立为制造许多重要食品所需的稳固的原料供应基地。
    这些重大缺点证明了我们伯力边疆区的地方工业和工业合作社的许多领导人是肤浅地从事自己的工作。他们没有具体领导各个企业，没有在组织工人劳动和最大限度地利用机械和设备方面，给各企业以帮助。这些领导人很少注意研究技术和生产状况，不关怀对材料消耗的正确计算，对面临的问题不作迅速的解决。
