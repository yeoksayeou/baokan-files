The Datong Mining Bureau Relaxes Leadership Over Production
Failure to Complete Production Tasks and Increased Accidents
Since the beginning of January this year, the Datong Mining Bureau shifted its leadership focus to capital construction and relaxed its leadership over production. As a result, production tasks were not well completed, and accidents have increased.

The mine completed its output plan in January, even with a reduced target compared to last year, but in February, it only completed 94.77% of the plan. Efficiency indicators were not met in either January or February. In terms of material consumption, the Third and Fourth Mines' use of explosives in January and February already exceeded the planned quantity for the entire first quarter. In tunneling, neither the progress nor output tasks were completed in January, falling 800 meters short of the plan. Last December, the entire bureau had ten teams that tunneled over 500 meters per month; this January, only three teams were able to maintain that record.

The combine coal mining machine used in the No. 6 well of the Second Mine frequently experienced accidents. During the trial period at the end of last November, it was already achieving two cycles per day (one cycle meaning the combine coal mining machine advances once into the coal seam on the work surface, with all trades completing all supporting work), with a peak of two and a half cycles and a daily output of over 400 tons. Now, the combine coal mining machine work surface sometimes doesn't even achieve one cycle, with a daily output of only over 200 tons, which is even lower than the output of the coal cutting machine work surface, while the cost is higher. According to calculations in early February, it was 58% higher than the coal cutting machine work surface.

The No. 6 well of the Second Mine, once a famous "educational well" (i.e., a model well), also had poor production performance in January and February. This well was one of the first in the country to implement regular cyclical operations according to instruction charts, but now there isn't even one work surface that can truly carry out regular operations according to the planned chart.

The safety situation is also very poor. There were 163 work-related injuries in the entire bureau in January. This number is greater than any month last year. In January alone, the Second Mine had 201 mechanical and electrical accidents, delaying production for 347 hours.

The poor production situation and numerous accidents are mainly due to the bureau's leading cadres relaxing their leadership over production. The Datong Mining Bureau currently has five directors, none of whom is specifically responsible for leading production. No one is responsible for the problems that occur in production. Sometimes a matter is pushed back and forth between departments and cannot be resolved in a timely manner. The 819 recovery work surface of the No. 6 well is short and uneven, with a lot of gangue (waste rock) in the coal seam, causing severe damage to the cutting heads. In the first ten days of February, more than 120 were damaged. It is not suitable for combine coal mining machine operation. A technician from the Mechanical and Electrical Department once suggested to the Second Mine and the Mining Bureau that the combine coal mining machine be placed on a suitable work surface, but no response was received from the bureau. The 801 coal mining work surface of the Fourth Mine wants to change to the first-grade roof management method because the second-grade roof management method is unsuitable. Changing to the first-grade roof management method requires more supports, and the mine requested approval from the Mining Bureau. This matter was passed between the Production Technology Department, the Planning Department, the Manager's Office, and the Deputy Director in the Mining Bureau, and finally returned to the Production Technology Department, but the problem was still not resolved. It was not until it affected the completion of the mine's production tasks that the director approved a temporary loan. The problem of the mining height (the thickness of coal mining) in the 852 coal mining work surface of the No. 5 well of the Second Mine has been a problem since last year. Because it could not be resolved, not only was a large amount of coal lost, but it also affected the No. 5 well's failure to complete its monthly production tasks. At the beginning of February this year, the Second Mine requested the Mining Bureau to approve some pit props for testing the mining height, but it was not resolved for nearly a month. The materials and equipment needed for production, such as electric drill bits, calcium carbide, and electric saws for sawing props, are also often not supplied in a timely and sufficient manner by the management departments, or the quality is poor and the specifications do not match. For example, the Second Mine needs three specifications of pit props according to the thickness of the coal seam: six feet, four feet, and nine feet, but what is supplied is five-meter long pit props. As a result, large materials are used for small purposes, which is both labor-intensive and wasteful. Because a batch of cadres and workers from production were transferred to capital construction, the morale of the cadres and workers remaining in production has fluctuated somewhat. Some production cadres also lack confidence in completing production tasks because there are fewer people, or they feel that this year's output plan is smaller than last year's, resulting in a sense of complacency. The leaders of the Mining Bureau have not paid attention to criticizing and correcting these thoughts.

### 大同矿务局放松对生产的领导  没有完成生产任务事故增加

    大同矿务局放松对生产的领导
    没有完成生产任务事故增加
    大同矿务局自今年一月初将领导重点转向基本建设后，放松了对生产的领导，因此生产任务未能很好完成，事故也增加了。
    该矿一月份在比去年减少了任务的情况下完成了产量计划，但二月份的计划仅仅完成了百分之九十四点七七。效率的指标，一、二月份都没有完成。在材料消耗方面，第三、四两矿一、二月所用的炮药已经超出了整个第一季度的计划数量。掘进方面，一月份进度任务和产量任务都没有完成，较计划差八百公尺。去年十二月份，全局共有十个组每月掘进五百公尺以上，今年一月份，能保持这一纪录的仅有三个组。
    二矿六号井所使用的康拜因机经常发生事故。去年十一月底试验期间已经作到每日两个循环（康拜因机在采煤工作面上向煤层推进一次，各工种做完一切配合工作，叫做一个循环），最高达到两个半循环，日产量四百吨以上。现在康拜因机工作面有时甚至连一个循环也达不到，日产量仅二百多吨，比割煤机工作面的产量还低。而成本则比割煤机工作面高。据二月上旬的计算比割煤机工作面高出百分之五十八。
    二矿六号井，曾经是有名的“教育井口”（即模范井口），一、二月份的生产情况也不大好。该井是全国实行按指示图表正规循环作业最早的井口之一，但现在能切实按照计划图表进行正规作业的工作面竟没有一个。
    安全情况也很不好。一月份全局公伤一百六十三人。这个数字比去年任何一个月都大，机电事故一月份仅二矿就有二百零一次，耽误生产三百四十七小时。
    生产情况不好，事故多，主要是因为该局的领导干部放松了对生产的领导。大同矿务局现有五个局长，没有一个局长专责领导生产。生产上发生的问题无人负责，有时一件事情在各部门之间推来推去，不能及时解决。六号井八一九回采工作面短而不平，煤矿夹石多，刀头损坏得很厉害。二月上旬十天当中就坏了一百二十多个，不适合康拜因机工作。机电处的一个技术员为此曾向二矿及矿务局提出意见，要求把康拜因机放在合适的工作面上，但一直没有得到局里的答复。四矿八○一采煤工作面，因为用二级顶板管理方法管理不适合，矿上想改用一级顶板管理方法。改用一级顶板管理方法需要多用
    一些支柱，矿上要求矿务局批准。就这样一件事情在矿务局转了生产技术处、计划处、经理处、副局长，最后又转回生产技术处，问题还是没有解决。直到影响了该矿生产任务的完成，局长才批准暂借。二矿五号井八五二采煤工作面的采高（采煤的厚度）问题，早在去年就嚷起，因为解决不了，不仅大量丢煤，而且影响五号井每月完不成生产任务。今年二月初，二矿为试验采高，要求矿务局批给一些坑木，将近一个月也没有解决。生产上所需要的材料设备，如电钻钻头、电石、锯支柱的电锯等，管理部门也常常不能及时地、充分地供应，或者是质量不好规格不合。如二矿按煤层厚度需要六英尺、四英尺、九英尺等三种规格的坑木，但供应的却是五公尺的长坑木，结果大材小用，既费工又费料。因为从生产上抽调了一批干部和工人到基本建设方面去，留在生产上的干部、工人的情绪便有些波动。还有些生产方面的干部因为人少了，对完成生产任务信心不足，或者觉得今年产量计划比去年小，产生了麻痹情绪。矿务局领导方面对这些思想也没有注意批判纠正。
