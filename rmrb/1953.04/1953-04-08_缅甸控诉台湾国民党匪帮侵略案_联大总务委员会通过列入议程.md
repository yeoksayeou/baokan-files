Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd. According to TASS, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on March 31 to discuss the inclusion of the Burmese government's proposal "The Union of Burma Accuses the Government of the Kuomintang of Taiwan of Acts of Aggression Against Burma" on the agenda of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The Burmese representative pointed out that the Kuomintang army's acts of aggression violating Burma's territorial integrity and sovereignty are a threat to peace and security in the Far East. He pointed out that this aggression, which began as early as 1950, is currently expanding. Therefore, the Burmese representative firmly requested that the Burmese government's proposal be included on the agenda of the General Assembly, and requested the adoption of the Burmese government's proposal, which urged the General Assembly to recommend that the Security Council condemn the aforementioned acts of aggression by the government of the Kuomintang of Taiwan, and take all necessary steps to ensure that the government of the Kuomintang of Taiwan immediately cease its acts of aggression against the Union of Burma.

The representative of the Kuomintang clique insisted that discussing the Burmese government's proposal in the General Assembly would not help solve the problem. However, no one on the General Committee supported this unfounded claim by the Kuomintang elements. The General Committee decided to include the proposal submitted by the Burmese delegation on the agenda of the General Assembly. The Kuomintang representative also suggested changing the words "Government of the Kuomintang of Taiwan" in the proposal to "Government of the Republic of China." The Burmese representative objected, and emphasized that the Burmese government recognizes the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, and that the Kuomintang elements in Taiwan have no reason to call themselves the government of China.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky spoke in support of the Burmese government's opinion.

    缅甸控诉台湾国民党匪帮侵略案
    联大总务委员会通过列入议程
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会在三月三十一日举行会议，讨论了把缅甸政府提出的“缅甸联邦控诉台湾国民党政府对缅甸的侵略行动”的议案列入联合国第七届大会议程的问题。
    缅甸代表指出：国民党军队侵犯缅甸领土完整和主权的侵略行动，是远东和平与安全的威胁。他指出：这种在一九五零年就早已开始的侵略行动，目前正在扩大。因此，缅甸代表坚决要求把缅甸政府提出的议案列入大会议程，并要求通过缅甸政府的提案，这个提案敦促大会建议安全理事会谴责台湾国民党政府的上述侵略行动，并采取一切必要步骤务使台湾国民党政府立即停止对缅甸联邦的侵略行动。
    国民党集团的代表硬说：在大会上讨论缅甸政府提出的议案，对于问题的解决不会有什么帮助。但是总务委员会没有一个人支持国民党分子的这种毫无根据的说法。总务委员会决定把缅甸代表团提出的议案列入大会议程。国民党代表又建议把议案上面的“台湾国民党政府”的字样改成“中华民国政府”。缅甸代表表示反对，并着重指出：缅甸政府承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府是中国的唯一合法政府，而台湾的国民党分子根本没有理由自称为中国政府。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言支持缅甸政府的意见。
