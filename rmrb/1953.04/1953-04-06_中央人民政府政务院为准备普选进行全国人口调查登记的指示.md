The 20th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee resolved: "To convene people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels elected by the people through universal suffrage in 1953, and on this basis, to convene the National People's Congress." In order to ensure that all citizens who have reached the age of eighteen can participate in the election according to the law, it is necessary to do a good job in registering voters. The registration of voters must be based on population registration. Therefore, a national population census should be conducted simultaneously with the election work to facilitate the election work and provide accurate population figures for the country's economic and cultural construction.

In order to complete this task, in addition to promulgating the National Population Census Regulations, forms and filling instructions, the following instructions are given:

    I. The national population census must be carried out in conjunction with voter registration. To avoid duplication and omissions, it is determined that 24:00 on June 30, 1953 (May 20th of the lunar calendar) shall be the standard time for the national population census. All investigation and registration work should be completed by the end of September. Each county, municipal district, and non-districted city shall report the population statistics of its jurisdiction to the province or city by the end of October; each province, city, and centrally-administered administrative unit shall report the population statistics of its jurisdiction to the central government by November 15.

    II. The institutions responsible for the population census: The central government shall establish a National Population Census Office by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in conjunction with relevant departments to uniformly lead the national population census. Provinces (cities) shall establish provincial (municipal) population census offices by the Department (Bureau) of Civil Affairs in conjunction with relevant departments. Counties, municipal districts, and non-districted cities shall establish population census offices under their respective people's governments. The population census offices at all levels are under the leadership of the election committees at the same level and are an integral part of the working bodies of the election committees at the same level.

    III. In order to do a good job in this population census and voter registration work nationwide, in addition to all cadres engaged in election work participating, local people's governments at all levels should also mobilize an appropriate number of teachers, students, cadres of people's organizations, and other personnel within a certain time limit to participate in the local investigation, registration, and summary statistics, etc., according to actual needs.

    IV. The population census agencies at all levels and the personnel participating in this work should study the National Population Census Regulations, forms, and instructions, and grasp the principles of non-duplication, non-omission, comprehensiveness, and accuracy to do a good job in the investigation and registration work.

    V. Before conducting the population census, it is necessary to launch extensive publicity to make the people fully understand the significance and purpose of this population census in order to obtain the people's enthusiastic response and support.

    VI. Investigation and registration stations should be set up during the investigation. Whether the method of householders registering at the station or the method of investigators visiting households is adopted when necessary, efforts should be made to facilitate the people, especially in rural areas, during agricultural breaks, and agricultural production should not be hindered.

    VII. The various expenses required for the population census shall be included in the election budget at all levels and reimbursed by the state treasury. For various forms used for investigation and registration, each province (city) shall make unified plans based on the formats stipulated by the National Bureau of Statistics, and shall be printed by the province or by the special district or county according to different situations.

This population census work is a very arduous task. People's governments at all levels must strengthen leadership, earnestly supervise and urge, to ensure the smooth completion of the national population census.

The National Population Census Regulations, forms and instructions are attached.

    中央人民政府政务院为准备普选进行全国人口调查登记的指示
    中央人民政府委员会第二十次会议决议：“于一九五三年召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省
    （市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会。”为了使全国年满十八周岁的公民都能依法参加选举，必须做好登记选民的工作。而选民的登记，又必须以人口登记为依据。因此应在选举工作同时，举行全国人口调查登记，以利选举工作的进行，并为国家的经济、文化建设，提供确实的人口数字。
    为完成这一工作，除颁发全国人口调查登记办法、表式及填写说明外，并作如下指示：
    一、全国人口调查登记工作，必须结合选民登记同时进行。为免重复与遗漏，确定以公历一九五三年六月三十日（旧历五月二十日）二十四时为全国人口调查登记的计算标准时间。所有调查登记工作应于九月底前全部完成。各县、市辖区及不设区的市应将所辖地区人口汇总统计于十月底前报省、市；各省、市及中央直辖行政单位应将所辖区人口汇总统计于十一月十五日前报中央。
    二、负责人口调查登记工作的机构：中央由内务部会同有关部门成立全国人口调查登记办公室，统一领导全国人口调查登记工作。省（市）由民政厅（局）会同有关部门成立省（市）人口调查登记办公室。县、市辖区及不设区的市在各该人民政府之下成立人口调查登记办公室。各级人口调查登记办公室受同级选举委员会的领导，并为同级选举委员会办事机构的一个组成部份。
    三、为了在全国范围内做好这次人口调查和选民登记工作，除全体从事选举工作的干部应参加进行外，各级地方人民政府还应根据实际需要，动员适当数量的教员、学生、人民团体的干部及其他人员在一定限期内，参加本地的调查、登记及汇总统计等项工作。
    四、各级人口调查登记机构及参加此项工作的人员，应对全国人口调查登记办法、表式及说明等加以研究，掌握不重复、不遗漏、全面、确实的原则，做好调查登记工作。
    五、在进行人口调查登记前，必须展开广泛宣传，使人民彻底了解这次人口调查的意义和目的，以取得人民热诚的响应和支持。
    六、调查时设调查登记站，无论采取户主到站登记的办法，或在必要时采取调查员逐户访查的办法，均应力求便利人民，在乡村尤应利用农事间隙，不得妨碍农业生产。
    七、人口调查登记所需各项经费列入各级选举预算之内，由国库报销。所用调查登记各项表式，各省（市）应依据国家统计局规定的格式，统一筹划，分别不同情况由省或交由专、县印刷。
    这次人口调查登记工作，是一件很艰巨的任务。各级人民政府必须加强领导，认真检查督促，以保证全国人口调查登记工作的顺利完成。
    全国人口调查登记办法、表式及说明附发。
                            总理　周恩来
                                        一九五三年四月三日
