    Rural Work in Xiangcheng, Henan, is Chaotic, Hindering Spring Planting
    Main Reasons are Unreasonable Work Arrangements from Higher Levels and Too Many Cadres Being Transferred
    Agricultural production in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, has been in a state of laissez-faire throughout March. From the county to the townships, leading cadres have been busy holding meetings to arrange work and solving other problems, and none of them have gone deeply into the key areas to lead production. The county's spring planting work is not as good as in previous years. In terms of sowing, leading cadres have not solved specific difficulties for the masses, let alone promoting advanced experiences and science and technology. Regarding fertilizer supply, the county cooperative has more than 700,000 jin of sesame cakes that cannot be sold, mainly because they are more expensive than the market price. The supply of farm tools also cannot keep up with the needs of the masses, and the farm tools of many grassroots cooperatives are also more expensive than the market price. Although the county also conducted spring planting mobilizations at the People's Representative Conference and propagandist representative conferences, it is not clear what role they played, how the production policies were implemented, what changes have taken place in the rural areas after the implementation of the Ten Measures of the Central and Southern Administrative Council, what ideological problems have been resolved, how they were resolved, what problems have not been resolved, or what new problems have arisen. The county's production plan was drawn up in a hurry, and many figures were miscalculated.
    Why is it that in March, at the critical juncture of spring planting, neither the county nor the townships can specifically lead production? Are the cadres not working hard? No. The cadres are busy all day long, with one task after another, running around non-stop. The county committee feels that "work tasks cannot be arranged," the district committee reflects that they "cannot hold the fort," and going to work in the townships is like "plugging holes" everywhere. Rural cadres generally complain: "Eating cold meals, taking big pees, running two steps as one; the district gets criticized, the township has to make self-criticisms." "Chasing the horse's tail all day long, eating cold meals for all three meals." Some cadres stay up all night to complete their tasks, and some cadres are so tired that they vomit blood. What is the key issue? It lies in the unreasonable work arrangements from top to bottom. In March, the work parallel to spring planting in the county included: mobilizing a large number of Huai River workers, disaster relief, implementing the Marriage Law, and strengthening rural security. The biggest conflict with spring planting, and the biggest headache for district and township cadres, is the mobilization of Huai River workers. The higher authorities originally allocated 19,300 workers to Xiangcheng County (later reduced by 2,000), and the task was assigned to the townships on February 19, requiring them to depart around February 25. Due to the large task and the urgent time, all the Huai River tools and sheds had to be brought by the workers themselves, and the economic difficulties could not be solved. For example, a group of twelve people would need nine carrying baskets, seven poles, two pickaxes, two steel shovels, and two iron rakes, plus a shed, averaging 80,000 yuan per worker. This might be possible in disaster-free townships and wealthy households, but it was impossible for severely affected townships and poor farmers. As a result, the task was basically completed by the end of the month, but many problems also arose. For example, Shantoudian Township in the eighth district allocated quotas based on labor force, and Zhang Township in Shiyuan in the ninth district allocated quotas based on land area to purchase sheds and tools in a unified manner. In Dingying (semi-disaster township) in the seventh district, out of the 126 workers mobilized, 26 households with 101 people had living difficulties, accounting for more than 20%. Village cadres were overwhelmed by the tasks and felt helpless, and some cadres cried in distress. Some township cadres knelt down to the workers because they would not go. Li Dayi, a cadre in Yingqiao Township in the fourth district, vomited blood from exhaustion. In any case, the task was always "completed." However, for some reason, the departure date of the workers kept changing, and it was not until March 28 that they all departed. Before the workers departed, district and township cadres were busy solving the specific problems of the workers' lives and production, and consolidating the workers' morale in all aspects, often being so busy solving a problem that they could not sleep or eat. District and township cadres arranged the vehicles for delivering sheds and tools, and then busied themselves sending off the workers, getting stuck in a difficult situation from which they could not extricate themselves.
    The large-scale transfer of cadres from above also had a great impact on spring planting. In mid-March, there were a total of 220 cadres in the nine districts of Xiangcheng County, including 45 district committee-level cadres and 175 general cadres. In addition to the 41 cadres transferred to work on the Huai River, 34 cadres were transferred to study. Apart from the financial, grain, and administrative staff of each district who could not go to the countryside, only 112 people were able to work, accounting for only half of the original cadres. The prefectural committee transferred 18 out of the 45 district committee-level cadres to study at once; now there are only 20 district committee-level cadres left, greatly weakening the leadership. Some districts only have one district committee secretary and district head left. The districts have complained to the county committee one after another, saying: "We can't hold the fort anymore!" "If we don't do it for them, we have to!" District-level cadres feel that the tasks are very heavy and are dragged into various meetings all day long, unable to go to the countryside and unable to deeply and specifically lead spring planting. For example, in the third district, from March 17 to 29, seven meetings were held in thirteen days, one of which lasted for two days. The district committee secretary kept shouting "I want to go down," but he still "can't go down."
    Therefore, when the county committee arranged work, although it also resolutely implemented the instructions of the higher authorities, "taking spring planting production as the overriding central task," it was delayed by other tasks for nearly a month, squeezing spring planting production so that even key areas could not be established. Spring planting production has been in a laissez-faire state due to lack of leadership. (Lü Daozhen)

    河南襄城农村工作忙乱妨碍春耕生产
    主要原因是上级工作安排不合理和抽调干部太多
    河南省襄城县三月份的农业生产一直处于自流状态。从县到乡，领导干部都忙于开会布置工作，忙于解决其他问题，大家都没有深入重点领导生产。全县的春耕生产工作不如往年。在播种方面，领导干部没有为群众解决具体困难，更谈不到推广先进经验和科学技术。在肥料供应方面，县合作社存着七十多万斤麻饼卖不出去，主要原因是比市价贵。农具的供应也赶不上群众的要求，许多基层社的农具也比市价贵。县里虽然也在各界人民代表会、宣传员代表会上进行了春耕动员，但究竟起了什么作用，生产政策贯彻的到底怎样，在贯彻中南行政委员会十大措施以后农村各阶层起了那些变化，那些思想问题解决了，如何解决的，那些问题没有解决，或者又发生那些新的问题，都摸不透。全县生产计划订得很仓促，有很多数字算错了。
    为什么在三月份春耕生产的紧急关头上，从县到乡都不能具体地领导生产呢？干部工作不努力吗？不是的。干部整天是忙忙碌碌，整天是一个工作接着又一个任务，到处不停地跑。县委感到“工作任务摆不开”，区委反映“守不住摊子”，到乡里去工作是到处“堵窟窿”。乡村干部普遍叫苦：“吃冷饭，尿大泡，两步并做一步跑；区里受批评，乡里得检讨。”“整天马头追着马尾，三顿饭都是吃冷的。”有的干部为完成任务整夜不睡，有的干部累得吐血。问题关键在什么地方呢？就在于自上而下的工作安排不合理。三月份全县与春耕生产平列着的工作有：大批治淮民工的动员、救灾、贯彻婚姻法，加强农村治安。和春耕生产矛盾最大、区乡干部最头痛的是动员治淮民工问题。上级原分配襄城县一万九千三百个民工（后又减去二千名），二月十九日布置到乡，要求二十五日左右出发。由于任务大、时间急，一切应用治淮工具工棚都是民工自带，经济困难没法解决。如十二人为一组，得用九个抬筐、七根杠子、两个洋镐、两张钢锨、两张铁耙，加上工棚，平均每个民工得八万元。在无灾乡和富裕户还可以，在重灾乡和贫苦农民就根本没法解决。结果，任务在月底基本上完成了，可是发生问题也很多。如八区山头店乡按劳力、九区柿园张乡按地亩进行统一摊派，制买工棚工具。七区丁营（半灾乡）动员的一百二十六个民工中，就有二十六户一百零一口人有生活困难，占百分之二十以上乡村干部被任务压着头，感到束手无策，有的干部为难得哭。有些乡干部因民工不去，给民工下跪。四区頴桥乡干部李大义累得吐血。不管怎样，任务总是“完成”了。但是，不知甚么原因，民工出发的日期一直在变，一直拖到三月二十八日才全部出发。在民工未出发前，区乡干部整天忙于解决民工生活、生产等具体问题，从各方面巩固民工情绪，往往因解决某一个问题而忙得不能睡觉和吃饭。区乡干部安置好了送工棚工具的车辆，又忙着欢送民工，整天陷于拔不出腿来的艰难局面。
    上边大批地抽调干部，对春耕生产也有很大的影响。三月中旬，襄城全县九个区共二百二十个干部，区委级四十五人，一般干部一百七十五人。除抽调治淮干部四十一人以外，被抽调学习的有三十四人。除各区财粮、事务员不能下乡外，能工作的仅剩一百一十二人，只占原有干部的一半。四十五个区委级干部，地委一次就调了十八个去学习；现在只剩二十个区委级干部，大大地减弱了领导力量。有的区仅剩下一个区委书记和区长。各区纷纷向县委叫苦说：“守不住摊子啦！”“这样不包办也得包办！”区级干部感到任务压得很重，整天拖在各种会议上，不能下乡，不能深入重点具体地领导春耕生产。如第三区，从三月十七日至二十九日，十三天中就开了七个会议，其中一个会就开了两天。区委书记整天嚷着“要下去”，结果还是一直“下不去”。
    因此，县委安排工作的时候，虽然也是坚决贯彻上级指示，“把春耕生产作为压倒一切的中心任务”，但结果被其他任务拖了将近一月，把春耕生产挤得连重点都设立不了。春耕生产一直处于缺乏领导的自流状态。    （吕道真）
