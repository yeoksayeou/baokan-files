Editor's Note: Based on the experience of the pilot work of implementing the Marriage Law and the experience of the Marriage Law Movement Month, the Propaganda Department of the Central China Bureau summarized seven work experiences in promoting the Marriage Law. These valuable experiences should not only be followed in the future to continue to promote and implement the Marriage Law, but also be followed by all propaganda work in rural areas in the future. Otherwise, it will cause confusion or lead to work failure. These work experiences are the fine traditions of our Party, and also good methods for ideologically mobilizing the masses in the social reforms in the Central China Region in the past three years. These experiences are:

First, the cadre training work is the key to determining whether the propaganda work can be done well. All those who have trained the cadres well, made the cadres clearly understand the nature, methods and requirements of the movement to implement the Marriage Law, and adopted persuasive education have achieved the expected results, and the masses have enthusiastically supported the Marriage Law. On the contrary, those who have not trained the cadres well and rashly carried out propaganda to the masses have made all kinds of mistakes and deepened the masses' misunderstanding of the Marriage Law. Therefore, the Central China Bureau of the CPC once decided: "Only when the cadres are well trained can they carry out propaganda to the masses." The Hunan Provincial Party Committee ended all the pilot work carried out by untrained cadres and brought these cadres back for retraining. These measures have powerfully guaranteed the correct conduct of propaganda work.

Second, propaganda on the Marriage Law should start from the masses' existing level of understanding, and gradually improve the masses' understanding. It should start from the common interests of the masses and what is easily accepted by the masses, and gradually improve, so that the masses have a comprehensive understanding of the Marriage Law. Experience in various places has proved that in places where the implementation of the Marriage Law has achieved results, the propaganda work first grasps Article 8 of Chapter 3 of the Marriage Law, namely, "Husbands and wives have the obligations to respect, love, help, support each other, live in harmony and unity, engage in labor and production, raise children, and work together for family happiness and the construction of a new society," explaining that the Marriage Law is to improve the relationship between husband and wife, family relations, and establish a democratic, harmonious and united new family, rather than to dismantle the family relations established under the old marriage system, nor is it to advocate divorce. Starting with the propaganda of this point, the masses are most welcome, because this point is the common requirement of the broad masses, and it is the easiest to accept at the existing level of understanding of the Marriage Law. Moreover, starting with positive propaganda on the positive significance of the Marriage Law can eliminate the misunderstanding of the Marriage Law among some people and make them willing to accept the propaganda of the Marriage Law. Some local grandmothers said after listening to such propaganda: "It is good to do a good job as much as possible for those who got married earlier. This method is good." On the contrary, some places initially emphasized "freedom of marriage," "freedom of divorce," "freedom of widows to remarry," or opposed maltreatment of women, interference with children's and others' marriages, which caused panic among the masses and increased concerns. However, after the masses have initially accepted some important provisions of the Marriage Law, they must be further guided to have a comprehensive understanding of the Marriage Law, to understand the benefits of the Marriage Law to all the people, the entire society, and the country, to understand the true meaning of equality between men and women and freedom of marriage, and to expose the harm of the old marriage system to the people, especially women; at the same time, it is also necessary to talk about how to achieve equality between men and women and freedom of marriage. Some places only publicized "harmonious family and united production," and as a result, the masses did not understand the full meaning of the Marriage Law. They said: "Isn't the implementation of the Marriage Law just to get women to produce?" Therefore, the propaganda of the Marriage Law must start from the common interests, proceed in an orderly manner, and at the same time, it must be further carried out to comprehensive propaganda, and the two cannot be separated.

Third, when mobilizing the masses to implement the Marriage Law, it is necessary to mobilize different objects separately, to solve different ideological problems from different angles for people with different concerns; and to mobilize comprehensively, so that all the people understand the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and eliminate misunderstandings. On the implementation of the Marriage Law, different objects have their own different views: for example, some people are looking forward to the movement, which is mainly dissatisfied with the old-fashioned marriage; some people are watching the movement and are indifferent, which is mainly because there is no problem in marriage; and some people are afraid of the movement, these are people who have abused women, interfered with children's or others' marriage autonomy, or have improper relations between men and women. As for the mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law, and husbands in the family, they often have different views on the Marriage Law because of their different positions in the family. Since the situation is so complicated, if the propaganda is not based on the ideological situation of various people, it is difficult to impress people and achieve propaganda results. In general, places where the propaganda work is done well first hold a meeting including all the people to explain the intention, explain the policies, stabilize the emotions of the masses, and eliminate the misunderstanding of some people about the movement to implement the Marriage Law; then hold meetings separately, and carry out different propaganda for different objects, such as women's associations (or daughters-in-law associations), youth associations, mothers-in-law associations (or elderly associations), men's associations, etc., and focus on solving the problem that the movement to implement the Marriage Law is not to fight against mothers-in-law, but to make mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law love each other, and guide them to recognize the crimes of the feudal marriage system at the mothers-in-law association. After the Leopard Lake Township of Wuchang, Hubei Province held a mothers-in-law association, an old woman named Jin said: "In the past, I thought that the Marriage Law was to fight against mothers-in-law, regardless of old or young. Now I know that it is for mothers-in-law to love daughters-in-law, daughters-in-law to love mothers-in-law, and the family to be united and harmonious." However, when holding these meetings, the following three points should be noted: (1) It must be held on the basis of the masses' preliminary understanding of marriage, otherwise it is easy to cause mutual suspicion. For example, some places started to hold daughters-in-law meetings, and the mothers-in-law suspected that they were mobilizing the daughters-in-law to fight against them, so they used various methods (such as sending benches, etc.) to inquire about the news. (2) Do not hold widow's associations and bachelor's associations, because holding such meetings is very easy to cause misunderstandings among the masses about the implementation of the Marriage Law or some vulgar views. Moreover, after holding women's associations and men's associations, there is no need to hold widow's associations and bachelor's associations. Experience in various places has proved that holding systematic meetings (such as women's associations and youth associations) has a better effect. (3) It is necessary to pay attention to carrying out comprehensive ideological mobilization at the same time, otherwise it is very easy to cause suspicion and misunderstanding, and increase disputes. For example, Liuzhou City, Guangxi Province, mainly did the work of mobilizing women, so the women said: "It is useless if only we understand, and men and mothers-in-law do not come, and the family cannot be harmonious." The men all said: "The women's attitudes have become tougher after studying." There are many mutual suspicions. In addition, some places use residential groups as units, and cadres or propagandists are assigned to carry out comprehensive and in-depth propaganda, which is also an effective method for in-depth propaganda.

Fourth, the propaganda of the Marriage Law must be vivid and specific, especially using local real people and real stories as "personal experiences" is the most effective. Some places do not contact reality when carrying out propaganda, and only talk about the articles dryly, or even read according to the propaganda outline of the Marriage Law, and the masses are unwilling to listen, and they do not understand even if they listen. For example, when Wushi Township, Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, held an elderly association, the cadre gave a lecture on the first chapter of the Marriage Law illustration in one breath, and then asked: "Is the Marriage Law good?" The old people just nodded and said: "The policies made by Chairman Mao, what's wrong?" In fact, they don't understand. Nanning City, Guangxi Province, used the marriage cases of more than 4,300 couples registered in the city in the past three years (80% of whom are working people) to explain the benefits of the Marriage Law to the working people. And focusing on introducing three pairs of harmonious couples and individual grass-roots cadres who have improved family relations after centralized training, the masses are very easy to accept. After Li Lanchun, a labor model of a model democratic and harmonious family in Tieshan Township, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, used "personal experience" to mediate the serious disputes in Li Shi'an's family, it had a great educational effect among the masses. The peasants said: "In the past, we thought that the Marriage Law was a 'divorce law'. Now we know the benefits of the Marriage Law. If families like Li Shi'an's are doing well, we must do a better job in family relations."

Fifth, the implementation of the Marriage Law must obey the local production work. To this end, attention should be paid to solving the following two problems: (1) Ideological understanding. It is necessary to recognize that the implementation of the Marriage Law is not contradictory to production, but consistent with production, and is conducive to production. If the Marriage Law is not well implemented, the family will be discordant, and production will be difficult to do well. Liu Zuolu, a farmer in Liaotian Township, Hengyang County, Hunan Province, originally had misunderstandings about the implementation of the Marriage Law. After propaganda and education, he said: "What you said is true. I didn't do a good job in production. Others only criticized me for being conservative. In fact, I haven't been in the mood to do production since I had a fight with my wife, and she is too lazy to do things. This time I must have a good relationship with her so that I can concentrate on production." (2) It is necessary to solve the problem of unified leadership. Under the unified leadership, uniformly arrange various local tasks, divide responsibilities, and arrange a certain amount of time for the propaganda of the Marriage Law. Tieshan Township, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, is a good example. When the key experimental work team for the implementation of the Marriage Law first arrived in Tieshan Township, the township was busy issuing land certificates and building water conservancy projects. According to this situation, the work team timely convened a meeting of township and group cadres to explain the intention, explain the policies, and put forward the slogan of "no delay in building water conservancy projects and implementing the Marriage Law" from the current concerns of the masses. According to everyone's opinions, land certificates were issued and water conservancy projects were built during the day, and the Marriage Law was studied and publicized at night, thus solving the problem of combining the implementation of the Marriage Law with the central work. At the same time, when the township selected model couples, it also helped the model couples make production plans, thereby promoting the production of the entire township. This is also an effective method to combine the propaganda of the Marriage Law with production.

Sixth, the deviations in the implementation of the Marriage Law must be publicly criticized to dispel the misunderstandings of the masses. The broad masses of grass-roots cadres are most familiar with the experience of class struggle, but they often use these experiences in the propaganda work of the Marriage Law, and often look at the problem of implementing the Marriage Law from the perspective of class struggle. Therefore, once a deviation occurs in the work, it must be resolutely conducted public self-criticism to distinguish right from wrong and educate cadres and the masses.

Seventh, the implementation of the Marriage Law is a widespread and in-depth propaganda work. To make it known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, not only oral propaganda, but also various forms of propaganda should be used together. Such as performing plays, showing movies, holding exhibitions, publishing blackboards, etc., among which movies, slides and other image propaganda methods are the most easily accepted by the masses and the most touching. For example, Chen Shaochang in Leopard Lake Township, Wuchang County, Hubei Province, had two daughters who were engaged in family arrangements. After watching the movie "Children's Marriage," they said: "After watching this movie, we can figure it out. Arranged marriages are not harmonious between men and women and hinder production. It's really not good." Others, such as Guangzhou City and Nanning City, have used real people and real stories for publicity during the experiment, and the results are very good.

At present, the country is facing a period of transition from the struggle against the enemy to long-term and meticulous education work within the people, from social reform to production and construction. Therefore, a series of new problems have occurred in the Party's propaganda work. It is necessary to summarize well the work experience of the past social reform period, to distinguish those good experiences that must be preserved and developed, those working methods that can no longer be used and must be discarded, and those new working methods that must be mastered and applied. In this way, cadres will not cut off history, they can see the achievements of the past, and they can also recognize the new environment of the present, so that their work confidence can be strengthened, and they can gradually learn and master the correct working methods suitable for the new situation in the new situation. Cadres have more than three years of social experience in the struggle against the enemy. If it is only generally proposed that the experience of social reform is no longer applicable in the future, and the practice of engaging in movements is not right, it will not be able to solve their ideological problems. It is necessary to combine various tasks to conduct a period of education, distinguish between good and bad, and find out the methods of propaganda work that cooperate with the movement in the future. The above-mentioned experience of the key experimental work of implementing the Marriage Law is a good method for ideologically mobilizing the masses in the social reforms in the past three years, and it is a good experience that should be preserved and developed.

    农村宣传工作应该掌握的工作规律
    ——中共中央中南局宣传部关于贯彻婚姻法宣传工作的总结
    编者按：中南局宣传部根据贯彻婚姻法试点工作经验和贯彻婚姻法运动月的工作经验，总结出七条宣传婚姻法的工作经验。这些宝贵经验不只是今后继续宣传贯彻婚姻法所应该遵守的，而且是今后农村中一切宣传工作都应该遵守的工作规律。
    中南区各省、市从去年十二月到今年二月，先后进行了一千二百七十六处贯彻婚姻法的重点试验工作，对贯彻婚姻法的宣传工作提供了许多经验。这些经验不仅对今后继续宣传婚姻法有很多帮助，而且是一切宣传工作都应该遵守的工作规律。不如此就会造成混乱或招致工作失败。这些工作经验是我们党的优良传统，也是过去三年来中南区社会改革中从思想上发动群众的好办法。这些经验是：
    第一、干部训练工作是决定宣传工作能否作好的关键。凡是把干部训练好，使干部明确认识贯彻婚姻法运动的性质、作法和要求，采用说服教育的地方，便都收到了预期的效果，群众都热烈拥护婚姻法。相反的，干部没训练好便冒然向群众进行宣传的，就偏差百出，加深了群众对婚姻法的误解。因此中共中央中南局曾决定：“干部训练好，才能向群众展开宣传。”湖南省委把未经过训练的干部所进行的试点工作全部结束，把这些干部抽回来重新训练，这些措施都有力地保证了宣传工作的正确进行。
    第二、宣传婚姻法要从群众现有认识水平出发，又要逐步提高群众认识，既要从有关群众的共同利益、为群众所容易接受的地方入手，又要逐步提高，使群众对婚姻法有全面的认识。各地经验证明，凡是贯彻婚姻法收到效果的地方，宣传工作都是首先抓住婚姻法的第三章第八条，即“夫妻有互敬互爱、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女、为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗的义务”，说明婚姻法是要搞好夫妻关系、家庭关系，建立民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭，而不是要拆散旧婚姻制度下建立起来的家庭关系，不是提倡离婚。首先抓住这点进行宣传，群众最欢迎，因为这一点是广大群众的共同要求，是在对婚姻法现有认识水平下最易接受的。而且一开始就正面宣传婚姻法的积极意义，便能消除群众中某些人对婚姻法的误解，乐意接受婚姻法的宣传。有的地方婆婆们听了这样的宣传以后说：“以前结婚的能搞好尽量搞好，这个办法好。”相反，有的地方一开始就强调“结婚自由”、“离婚自由”、“寡妇再嫁自由”，或反对虐待妇女、干涉子女和别人婚姻，则造成群众恐慌，增加顾虑。但在群众初步接受了婚姻法某些重要条款以后，就必须进一步引导他们全面认识婚姻法，认识婚姻法对全体人民、对整个社会、国家的好处，认识男女平等、婚姻自由的真正意义，并对比着揭露旧婚姻制度给予人民群众、特别是妇女群众的害处；同时还要讲怎样达到男女平等、婚姻自由。有的地方只宣传了“和睦家庭、团结生产”，结果群众还没有懂得婚姻法的全部意义。他们说：“实行婚姻法还不是要妇女去生产？”因此对婚姻法的宣传必须从有关共同利益入手，循序渐进，同时又须进一步作到全面的宣传，两者不可分割。
    第三、发动群众贯彻婚姻法时，既要分别不同对象，针对有不同顾虑的人分别发动，从不同角度出发去解决不同的思想问题；又要全面发动，使全体人民都了解婚姻法的基本精神，消除误解。对贯彻婚姻法，不同对象各有自己不同的看法：例如有的人是盼运动，这主要是对旧式婚姻不满的；有的人看运动、漠不关心，这主要是在婚姻上没有问题的；还有的人是怕运动，这些都是有过虐待妇女、干涉子女或别人婚姻自主或有不正当男女关系的人。至于家庭成员中的婆婆、媳妇、丈夫，又往往因为他们在家庭中所处的不同地位，对婚姻法也有不同看法。由于情况是这样的复杂，如果在进行宣传时不根据各种不同人的思想情况，有的放矢，就很难打动人心，收到宣传效果。各地宣传工作作得好的地方，一般都是先开包括全体人民的大会，说明来意，交代政策，安定群众情绪，消除某些人对贯彻婚姻法运动的误解；然后分别开会，针对不同对象进行不同的宣传，如妇女会（或媳妇会）、青年会、婆婆会（或老人会）、男人会等，在婆婆会上着重解决贯彻婚姻法运动不是要斗争婆婆，而是要婆媳互爱，并引导他们认识封建婚姻制度的罪恶。湖北武昌豹湖乡召开婆婆会后，一位叫金老婆婆的说：“过去我以为婚姻法是要斗争婆婆，没老没少，这回才晓得是为了婆婆爱媳妇，媳妇爱婆婆，一家人团结和气。”但在开这些会时应注意以下三点：（一）必须在群众对婚姻有了初步认识的基础上去召开，不然容易引起互相猜疑。如有的地方一开始就开媳妇会，婆婆猜疑是发动媳妇来斗争她们，于是就用各种办法（如送凳子等）来打听消息。（二）不要开寡妇会和单身汉会，因为开这样的会很容易引起群众对贯彻婚姻法的误解或某些庸俗的看法。而且开了妇女会、男人会，也没有必要再开寡妇会和单身汉会。各地经验证明，开系统会（如妇女会、青年会）效果较好。（三）必须注意同时进行全面思想发动，否则极易引起猜疑和误解，增加纠纷。如广西柳州市主要是作了发动妇女的工作，于是妇女们就说：“光是我们懂得，男人、婆婆都不来，家庭也和睦不起来。”男的都说：“妇女学习回来，态度都硬了。”互相猜疑很多。另外，有的地方以居民小组为单位，由干部或宣传员分别包干进行全面深入的宣传，也是一个深入宣传的有效办法。
    第四、贯彻婚姻法宣传要生动具体，特别是用当地真人真事“现身说法”最为有效。有的地方进行宣传时不联系实际，只干巴巴地讲条文，甚至照着婚姻法宣传提纲念，群众都不愿意听，听了也不懂。如广东曲江县乌石乡召开老人会时，干部一口气把婚姻法图解第一章讲完，便问：“婚姻法好不好？”老人们只点点头说：“毛主席定出来的政策，有什么不好？”其实并不懂。广西南宁市用全市三年来四千三百多对登记结婚的（其中百分之八十是劳动人民）结婚的事例，说明婚姻法对劳动人民的好处。并着重介绍比较好的三对和睦夫妻和个别基层干部经集训后改善家庭关系的事例，群众就很容易接受。湖南浏阳县铁山乡通过民主和睦模范家庭的劳动模范李兰春，用“现身说法”调解了李石安家的严重纠纷后，在群众中起了很大教育作用。农民们说：“以前我们认为婚姻法是‘离婚法’，现在可知道婚姻法的好处了，像李石安那样的家庭都搞好了，我们更是要搞好家庭关系。”
    第五、贯彻婚姻法必须服从当地生产工作。为此，要注意解决以下两个问题：（一）思想认识问题。要认识贯彻婚姻法不是和生产相矛盾，而是和生产相一致，并且是有利于生产的。不很好地贯彻婚姻法，家庭不和，生产就很难搞好。湖南衡阳县廖田乡农民刘作录原来对贯彻婚姻法有误解，经过宣传教育以后，他说：“讲的真对，我的生产没搞好，别人只批评我有保守思想，其实我自从跟老婆打了架，就没有心搞生产，她也懒得做事。这次我一定要和她搞好关系，好安心生产。”（二）要解决统一领导问题。在统一领导下，统一布置地方各项工作，分工负责，给婚姻法宣传安排一定时间，湖南浏阳县铁山乡就是一个很好的例子。贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作组初到铁山乡时，该乡正忙于发土地证和兴修水利。工作组根据这个情况，及时召开乡、组干部会，说明来意，交代政策，并从群众当前关心的事出发，提出“兴修水利和贯彻婚姻法两不误”的口号。根据大家意见，白天发土地证和兴修水利，晚上学习、宣传婚姻法，这样就解决了贯彻婚姻法与中心工作的结合问题。同时该乡在评出模范夫妻时，又帮助模范夫妻订生产计划，从而推动了全乡生产。这也是使宣传婚姻法与生产相结合的一个有效方法。
    第六、贯彻婚姻法工作中的偏差必须公开批判，以消解群众误解。广大基层干部最熟悉的是阶级斗争的经验，但他们在婚姻法宣传工作中常常搬用这些经验，并常用阶级斗争的眼光来看贯彻婚姻法的问题。因此工作一旦发生偏差，必须坚决进行公开检讨，以分明是非，教育干部和群众。
    第七、贯彻婚姻法是一个广泛而深入的宣传工作，要作到家喻户晓，深入人心，不但要进行口头宣传，还要用多种多样宣传形式一齐配合。如演戏、放电影、开展览会、出黑板报等，其中放电影、幻灯等形象宣传方式最容易为群众所接受，感人也最深。如湖北武昌县豹湖乡陈绍昌有两个姑娘都在家庭包办下订了婚，她们看了“儿女亲事”电影以后，说：“看了这个电影，我们可想通了，包办婚姻男女不和、妨碍生产真不好。”其他如广州市、南宁市在进行试验时都运用了真人真事的宣传方式，收效都很好。
    目前全国正面临着从对敌斗争转入对人民内部进行长期的细致的教育工作的时期，从社会改革转入生产建设的时期，党的宣传工作因此也就发生了一系列的新问题，这就需要很好地总结一下过去社会改革时期的工作经验，分清那些是必须保存下来并发挥提高的好经验，那些工作方法是不能再袭用、必须抛弃的，那些是新的工作方法必须加以掌握、加以运用的。这样，干部才不致割断历史，既能看到过去成绩，也能认清当前的新环境，而使工作信心加强起来，能够在新的情况下逐渐学习掌握适应于新的情况的正确的工作方法。干部有三年多对敌斗争的社会经验，如果只是一般地提出社会改革经验今后不适用了，搞运动的做法不对头了，是不能解决他们的思想问题的。必须结合各项工作进行一段教育，分清好坏，找出今后配合运动宣传工作的做法。上述贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作的经验，正是三年来社会改革中从思想上发动群众的好办法，是应该保存下来，并发挥提高的好经验。
