    The design work for the Dahuo房 Reservoir construction project on the Hun River, a tributary of the Liao River, the first major project in the Northeast region to fundamentally control the Liao River, has been completed. Work is now being stepped up to collect materials, train workers, and mobilize laborers in preparation for large-scale construction to begin on May 1st.
    The Liao River is 2,073 kilometers long, and its middle and lower reaches are densely populated, fertile, and abundant in agricultural products. However, in the Liaodong and Liaoxi areas of the lower reaches of the Liao River, tributaries easily cause floods during the flood season. In the three years from 1935 to 1937 alone, an average of 2.2 million hectares (15 mu per hectare) of land were flooded each year. After liberation, the People's Government vigorously implemented various flood control measures in the Liao River basin, greatly reducing the annual disaster area. Starting in 1950, it also began drafting a plan to fundamentally control the Liao River. Now, this plan has been approved by the State Council of the Central People's Government, which has decided to first manage its main tributary, the Hun River.
    Under the guidance of advanced Soviet design ideas, the Hun River management project has adopted a policy of focusing on flood control and using it to promote benefits. It has been decided to build a reservoir at Dahuo房 Village, a suburb of Fushun City, in the lower reaches of the Hun River. This reservoir has an area of 104.5 square kilometers and a maximum flood storage capacity of 1.859 billion cubic meters. The project is divided into three parts: a dam, a water conveyance channel, and a spillway. The largest project is the earth dam, with a total earthwork volume of more than 7 million cubic meters. It is expected that this reservoir will be completed by 1956. After the Dahuo房 Reservoir is completed, the flow of the Hun River can be reduced from 7,000 cubic meters per second to 306 cubic meters per second, which can greatly reduce the threat of floods in the lower reaches of the Liao River. Coupled with the construction of the Canwo Reservoir on the Taizi River, another tributary of the Liao River, the historical water disasters in the lower reaches of the Liao River can be basically eliminated. After the Dahuo房 Reservoir begins to store floodwater, the entire industrial water supply for the industrial and mining areas of Fushun, Shenyang, and other areas along the Hun River can be fully supplied; 30,000 hectares of paddy fields and 60,000 hectares of cotton fields on both sides can also be irrigated.

    根治辽河的大火房水库工程  完成设计工作积极准备动工
    东北区根治辽河的第一个巨大工程——辽河支流浑河大火房水库建筑工程的设计工作已经完成。现正加紧进行筹集物资、训练工人和动员民工的工作，以迎接五月一日的大规模动工。
    辽河长达两千零七十三公里，中、下游是东北人烟稠密、土地肥沃、农产品丰饶的地区。但是在辽河下游的辽东、辽西地区，由于支流注入，汛期内极易泛滥成灾。单是一九三五年到一九三七年的三年中，平均每年淹地就有二百二十万垧（每垧十五市亩）。解放后，人民政府曾在辽河流域大力进行了各种防洪措施，使每年的受灾面积大大缩小。从一九五零年开始，又着手草拟根治辽河的方案。现在，这个方案已经中央人民政府政务院批准，决定首先治理其主要支流浑河。
    浑河治理工程在苏联的先进设计思想指导下，采取了以控制洪水为主，并借以兴利的方针，决定在浑河下游抚顺市郊大火房村修建一座水库，这座水库面积有一百零四点五平方公里，最大蓄洪量能拦蓄十八亿五千九百万立方公尺的洪水。工程共分拦河坝、输水道和溢洪道三部分。其中最大的工程是土质拦河坝，土方总量约有七百多万立方公尺。这座水库预计到一九五六年可以修好。大火房水库修成后，浑河的流量可以从七千秒立方公尺降到三百零六秒立方公尺，可使辽河下游的洪水威胁大大减轻。再配合辽河另一支流太子河参窝水库的修建，辽河下游历史性的水患就可基本消除。大火房水库开始拦蓄洪水后，浑河沿岸的抚顺、沈阳等工矿区的全部工业用水可得到充分供应；两岸的三万垧水田和六万垧棉田也可以有水灌溉。（新华社）
