Heavy Industry Department Basic Construction Bureau

According to reports from inspection teams dispatched by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and its various bureaus, the struggle against waste and the phenomenon of nobody taking responsibility has not yet developed into a mass movement in various construction sites, engineering companies, and basic construction departments. Many units have only made general arrangements for communication, without specific action plans and steps, and without clear goals and specific requirements. Why has this movement not been launched rapidly and thoroughly? This is mainly because many leading cadres still have many incorrect understandings of the movement.

Some comrades say that the preparatory work is currently very tense, and some have just started construction and are extremely busy, so there is no time to carry out the struggle against "waste and the phenomenon of nobody taking responsibility." They believe that launching this movement will hinder the current construction preparation work and commencement work. They put the work of starting construction and preparing for construction in opposition to the movement against waste and the establishment of a responsibility system. They do not realize that it is precisely because there are still many phenomena of waste and nobody taking responsibility in the current construction preparation and construction that basic construction projects cannot start quickly. If we can launch this movement correctly and step by step, thoroughly expose the serious waste and phenomena of nobody taking responsibility, and gradually establish and implement the responsibility system, it will inevitably bring a new atmosphere to the basic construction department and greatly help the smooth completion of this year's basic construction plan.

Other comrades say that we have already conveyed the instructions of the ministry; we will carry out publicity and education against waste, and then establish various responsibility systems. These comrades simply do not want to mobilize the masses to carry out this movement, and feel that "opposing" will lead to "chaos"; they understand the entire meaning of this movement only as conveying education, plus announcing the responsibility system. These comrades simply do not realize that the masses of workers (including workers, technicians, and staff) are the people who know the most about waste and the phenomenon of nobody taking responsibility, and who deeply feel the losses that these phenomena bring to the country and the people; without mobilizing the masses, it is impossible to thoroughly expose the existing shortcomings, it is impossible to discover the true situation of all problems, and therefore it is impossible to find the correct and specific ways to correct the shortcomings; at the same time, these comrades do not realize that the process of the masses boldly exposing waste and the phenomenon of nobody taking responsibility will inevitably be a process of self-education for the masses, improving their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. The responsibility system established by the masses themselves through the exposure of the masses will be more practical and can be consciously observed by the masses. Therefore, any practice that does not want to mobilize the masses is wrong.

Some comrades believe that anti-waste is the main thing; establishing a responsibility system is secondary. This understanding is one-sided and incorrect. It must be pointed out that the reason why there are many serious and astonishing phenomena of waste in various basic construction departments is inseparable from the phenomena of nobody taking responsibility and irresponsibility. The main purpose of our struggle against waste and the phenomenon of nobody taking responsibility is to establish various responsibility systems. Only by establishing a responsibility system can all the work of the basic construction department, whether it is done well or badly, be the responsibility of a specific person, can the current chaotic phenomenon of basic construction work be gradually overcome, and can the various waste phenomena in the current construction be overcome. In order to establish a practical and feasible responsibility system, it is necessary to start with the mass anti-waste and anti-nobody-taking-responsibility work. If the movement to mobilize the masses to expose waste and the phenomenon of nobody taking responsibility is not done well, the responsibility system cannot be established.

In addition, some comrades are not clear in their thinking about the specific requirements of the movement, lack planning, blindly mobilize the masses, and are very unclear about the requirements, steps, methods of the movement, especially what responsibility system to establish. The result will inevitably make the entire movement have a beginning but no end, "vigorous" and formalistic, and cannot achieve practical results. What is particularly serious is that some comrades are not clear about the main waste phenomena and nobody-taking-responsibility phenomena in their units, do not know what main ideas to oppose and what responsibility system to establish in their units, but oppose everything and build everything. The result is generalization, which cannot thoroughly solve the key problems of their units.

Based on the above situation, we believe that leading cadres of various construction units and construction units should immediately criticize various incorrect ideas, face up to the widespread and serious waste phenomena and nobody-taking-responsibility phenomena that currently exist, and clarify that the central link to improving current work is to launch a struggle against waste and the phenomenon of nobody taking responsibility; through this struggle, the management of basic construction work will be further advanced.

In order to deeply carry out this movement, we believe that the following issues still need to be paid attention to in terms of steps and methods:

Doing a good job of preparation is the prerequisite for whether the movement can be carried out correctly and fully. Each basic construction unit should first unify the leading ideology and do a good job of preparation in a planned way. In the preparation work, first, it is necessary to conduct investigation and research on the main and typical waste and nobody-taking-responsibility phenomena, and clearly put forward the main problems to be solved in the movement, which should focus on checking various nobody-taking-responsibility phenomena and the various waste phenomena in construction caused by them, such as major quality accidents, chaotic management of equipment and materials, unreasonable cost quotas, etc. It is necessary to prevent simply getting entangled in external factors such as poor planning or design lagging behind construction, and neglecting how to improve the work of the unit. Second, it is necessary to attach importance to the study of documents, so as to criticize wrong ideas and unify the understanding of all cadres. In particular, ideological and political work should be strengthened among technicians and staff members to mobilize them well. Third, it is necessary to start studying the plan for establishing and improving the main responsibility system based on the specific situation of the unit, so that after the masses are mobilized, they can be organized to discuss, enrich and improve them in a timely and conscious manner and adhere to implementation. Fourth, the movement should be led by the main cadres of various basic construction departments from the very beginning, and mobilize and deploy to all employees, conduct regular inspections, and summarize experiences and lessons to promote the progress of the movement.

We believe that as long as the preparation work is done well, the exposure time will not be too long, and it should not be too long. When the movement enters its climax, it should be transferred to the construction stage in a timely and rapid manner, organize the masses to discuss various main responsibility systems, and then transfer the movement to normalization through forms such as employee representative meetings.

In the entire movement, doing a good job of political and ideological work is an important link. Past experience has repeatedly proven that, according to the progress of the movement (including the ideological situation of the workers, the good experiences in the movement, and the bad examples), timely carrying out various vivid propaganda and mobilization work, criticizing various wrong ideas, and commending various advanced deeds and advanced figures, are the most important methods to deeply enlighten and educate the masses and make the entire mass movement lively and actively move forward. The movement against waste and the establishment of a responsibility system is a concrete struggle against bureaucracy in the industrial sector. In this struggle, leading cadres of all construction units and construction units should not hesitate to take the lead in conducting self-examination, actively mobilize the masses to boldly expose various waste and nobody-taking-responsibility phenomena in their units, so as to establish our construction management work on the basis of the responsibility system, improve and improve the management level, and better complete this year's heavy basic construction tasks.

    反对各种不正确思想迅速深入开展反浪费建立责任制运动
    重工业部基本建设司
    根据重工业部及各局所派出的检查组的报告，目前各工地、各工程公司、各个基本建设部门，对于反对浪费，反对无人负责现象的斗争，尚未形成一个群众运动。不少单位只作了一般的传达布置，没有具体的行动计划和步骤，没有明确的目标与具体要求。为什么这个运动还没有迅速地深入地展开呢？这主要是由于许多领导干部对运动还存在着许多不正确的认识。
    有些同志说，目前准备工作很紧张，有的刚刚开工，忙得要命，没有时间进行“反浪费，反无人负责现象”的斗争，目前开展这一个运动，就会妨碍当前的施工准备工作及开工工作。他们把开工和准备开工所进行的工作与反对浪费、建立责任制运动对立起来。他们没有认识到，正由于目前施工准备及施工中还存在许多浪费及无人负责现象，才使得基本建设工程不能迅速开工。如果我们能够有步骤地正确地开展这一运动，彻底揭发其中的严重浪费和无人负责现象，并逐步地建立和贯彻责任制，就必然会给基本建设部门带来新的气象，而大大有助于今年基本建设计划的顺利完成。
    另有一些同志说，部的指示我们已经传达了；我们将展开反浪费的宣传教育，然后建立起各种责任制度。这些同志根本不想发动群众来开展这一运动，觉得一“反”就会“乱套”；他们把这一次运动的全部意义只了解为不过是传达教育，再加上宣布责任制而已。这些同志根本没有认识到职工群众（包括工人、技术人员和职员群众）乃是对浪费现象和无人负责现象了解最多以及对于这些现象给予国家和人民带来损失体会最深的人；不发动群众就不可能使现存的缺点得到彻底的揭发，就不可能发现全部问题的真实情况，因而也就不可能找出改正缺点的正确的具体的途径；同时，这些同志也没有认识到群众对浪费和无人负责现象的大胆揭发的过程，也必然就会是群众自我教育，提高积极性和责任心的过程。通过群众的揭发，再通过群众亲自建立的责任制度，才是更切合实际，才能为群众自觉地遵守。因此任何不想发动群众的做法都是错误的。
    有些同志认为，反浪费是主要的；建立责任制是次要的。这种认识是片面的，是不正确的。必须指出，目前各个基本建设部门所以存在着许多严重的惊人的浪费现象，是和无人负责与不负责任的现象分不开的，我们要开展反浪费、反无人负责现象的斗争，其主要目的就是为了建立各种责任制，只有建立了责任制才能使基本建设部门所有的工作，办好办坏，都有专人负责，才能逐渐克服目前基本建设工作的混乱现象，才能克服目前施工当中的各种浪费现象。为了要建立切实可行的责任制度，则又必须从群众性反浪费、反无人负责的工作入手，如果发动群众揭发浪费和无人负责现象的运动搞得不好，责任制也就不可能建立起来。
    另外还有一些同志对运动的具体要求在思想上不明确，缺乏计划性，盲目地发动群众，而对运动的要求、步骤、方法，特别是要建立什么责任制等都很不明确，其结果必然使整个运动有头无尾，“轰轰烈烈”而流于形式，不能收到实际效果。特别严重的是有些同志对本单位的主要浪费现象和无人负责现象心中无数，不知道在本单位主要的要反对什么思想与建立什么责任制，而是什么都反，什么都建，其结果是一般化，不能透彻地解决本单位的关键问题。
    根据以上情况，我们认为各建设单位，各施工单位的领导干部，应该立即批判各种不正确的思想，正视目前普遍而严重存在着的浪费现象和无人负责现象，明确改进当前工作的中心环节就是开展反对浪费、反对无人负责现象的斗争；经过这一斗争把基本建设的管理工作，向前推进一步。
    为了深入地开展这一运动，在步骤与方法上我们认为还需要注意以下问题：
    做好准备工作是运动能否正确地饱满地开展的前提。各个基本建设单位应该首先统一领导思想，有计划地做好准备工作。在准备工作中，第一，要进行关于主要的典型的浪费和无人负责现象的调查研究，明确提出运动中所要解决的主要问题，其中应特别着重于检查各种无人负责现象及由此而产生的施工当中各种浪费现象，如重大质量事故，设备材料保管的混乱，费用定额不合理等，要防止单纯地纠缠在计划不周或设计落后于施工等外来因素上，而忽略了如何改进本单位工作。第二，要重视文件的学习，从而批判错误思想，统一全体干部的认识。特别应加强技术人员和职员中的思想政治工作，把他们很好地发动起来。第三，要根据本单位的具体情况着手研究建立与健全主要的责任制度的方案，以便在群众发动起来后，及时地有意识地组织群众讨论，加以充实改进并坚持贯彻。第四，运动一开始就应该由各基本建设部门的主要干部亲自负责领导，并向全体职工进行动员布置，经常进行检查，并总结经验教训，以推动运动的前进。
    我们认为只要作好了准备工作，揭发的时间就不会过长，同时也不宜过长。当运动进入高潮时，应当适时而迅速地转入建设阶段，组织群众讨论各种主要的责任制度，然后可以通过职工代表会等形式把运动转入经常化。
    在整个运动中，作好政治思想工作是重要的环节。过去经验已一再证明，根据运动进展的状况（包括职工群众的思想状况，运动中好的经验，与坏的例子），适时地进行各种生动的宣传鼓动工作，并对各种错误思想进行批判，对各种先进事例、先进人物进行表扬，是最能深入地启发和教育群众、使整个群众运动生动而活泼地前进的重要方法。反对浪费、建立责任制运动乃是工业部门中具体的反官僚主义的斗争。在这一斗争中，所有建设单位和施工单位的领导干部都应该毫不犹豫地带头进行自我检查，积极地发动群众大胆揭发本单位各种浪费和无人负责现象，从而把我们的施工管理工作建立在责任制的基础上，改进和提高管理水平，更好地完成今年繁重的基本建设施工任务。
