Since the beginning of spring, some areas of 133 counties in the Southwest region have experienced varying degrees of spring famine, with a grain shortage affecting over one million people. The main reason for the disaster was that these areas suffered natural disasters last year, resulting in reduced autumn harvests. After the disaster occurred, the relevant provinces issued instructions on production and disaster relief work, allocated large amounts of relief grain and funds to help disaster victims help themselves through production; and sent inspection teams to go deep into the disaster areas to understand the disaster situation and guide disaster relief work. All severely affected areas have taken production and disaster relief work as the overriding central task. After discovering the spring famine, leading Party and government cadres in Dazhou, Nanchong, Luzhou, and Wanxian Special Districts in Sichuan Province, and Xingyi, Bijie, and Duyun Special Districts in Guizhou Province, immediately went deep into the disaster areas to personally organize and lead the masses in self-salvation through production. According to the actual situation of the spring famine in the local areas, the leading organs of Gulin County in Sichuan Province and Yingjing County in Xikang Province demarcated several work areas, with members of the CCP County Committee leading cadres to take personal charge and contract to do a good job in disaster relief. Leading cadres in Pingyi and Chuxiong in Yunnan Province and Zitong in Sichuan Province went deep into the disaster areas to find out the details, and then formulated practical production and disaster relief plans based on local conditions and specific production conditions to specifically solve the local spring famine and grain shortage problems.

Many disaster areas implemented work-for-relief programs, mobilizing disaster victims to carry and transport sleepers, transport grain, and build water conservancy projects, which solved the difficulty of short-term food shortages for many disaster victims. Many places publicized the policy of free lending, conducted "mutual aid and mutual relief" education, and the credit relations in rural areas were restored, which also solved the difficulties of some disaster victims. In the Northwest Township of Yongchuan County, Sichuan Province, 136 households voluntarily lent out 13,871 catties of yellow rice, 3.88 million yuan in Renminbi, and thousands of catties of sweet potatoes, sorghum, and other miscellaneous grains in fourteen days, which solved the difficulties of more than 500 people. Local people's governments issued various loans in the disaster areas in a timely manner, which played a great role in solving the problem of grain shortage for farmers. After taking these effective measures, the spring famine in many areas has now stopped developing, and some areas have basically solved the problem of grain shortage.

    西南部分受灾地区春荒停止发展
    入春以来，西南区有一百三十三个县的部分地区发生了不同程度的春荒，缺粮人口达一百多万。造成灾荒的原因，主要是这些地区去年遭受自然灾害，秋收减产。灾情发生后，有关各省都发出了关于生产救灾工作的指示，拨出了大批救济粮款，扶助灾民生产自救；并派检查组深入灾区，了解灾情，指导救灾工作。各重灾区都以生产救灾工作作为压倒一切的中心任务。四川省达县、南充、泸县、万县和贵州省的兴义、毕节、都匀等专区的党政领导干部，在发现春荒后，立即深入灾区，亲自组织领导群众生产自救。四川省古蔺县和西康省荥经县领导机关根据当地春荒的实际情况，划定几个工作区，由中共县委委员带领干部亲自掌握，包干作好救灾工作。云南省平彝、楚雄和四川省梓潼等地领导干部深入灾区摸清底细，然后根据当地情况和具体的生产条件，订出切合实际的生产救灾计划，具体地解决当地的春荒缺粮问题。
    不少灾区实行以工代赈，发动灾民抬运枕木、运粮、兴修水利，解决了很多灾民短缺口粮的困难。很多地方向农民宣传借贷自由的政策，进行了“互助互济”的教育，农村的信贷关系恢复了，这也解决了部分灾民的困难。四川省永川县西北乡，在十四天中即有一百三十六户自愿借出黄谷一万三千八百七十一斤，人民币三百八十八万元，以及甘藷、高粱等杂粮数千斤，解决了五百多人的困难。各地人民政府适时地在灾区发放了各种贷款，对解决农民的缺粮困难起了很大的作用。采取了这样一些有效措施以后，目前不少地区春荒已停止发展，有的地区已基本上解决了缺粮问题。
