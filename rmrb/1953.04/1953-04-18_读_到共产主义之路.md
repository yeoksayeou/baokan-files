    Reading "The Road to Communism"
    By Yika
    Published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House
    "The Road to Communism" describes the collective farm movement in Soviet Ukraine. Dubkovetsky was one of the initiators of this movement. Through his personal experience, he vividly describes the growth of the "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm in Uman County, Kiev Province, Ukraine, and is moving towards communism with full confidence. The road of Soviet collective farms is also the future of agricultural development in our country. Therefore, from this book, we can not only understand the road they have traveled, but also learn many experiences from the workers in collective farm construction.

    This "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm is one of the advanced collective farms in the Soviet Union, and the members live a prosperous and beautiful life. There is no need to introduce this situation in detail, just compare it with the life of Russian farmers in the old days.

    Dubkovetsky wrote that the farmers at that time "were concerned about... the land, horses, plows and harrows, and finally the thatched cottage they lived in and the clothes they wore, and rarely thought about any equipment in the house. They slept on benches, ate with earthenware pots, and did not wash their faces with washbasins." But now "what he thinks about is to have furniture, radios, and phonographs in his house, to make his children dress well, and to have a motorcycle or bicycle painted and nickel-plated in his yard instead of horses tied up. No matter whose home you go to, the house is very clean, with electric lights and radios. The master is reading a book or newspaper, and the mistress is ironing clothes with an electric iron." What a huge change this is! Dubkovetsky recalled with emotion: "I have been the chairman of this collective farm for twenty-nine years, but I often fail to see the major changes that have taken place during this period. ... The former farmers were illiterate and ignorant people, and some were even afraid when they saw locomotives. But these 'farmers' have now mastered technology and agronomic science, and have mastered everything."

    However, their beautiful life was not obtained easily, but through a difficult struggle. The predecessor of the "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm was the "Honeycomb and Bees" collective farm, which was initiated by Dubkovetsky and other comrades in November 1922. At that time, the public property was only six horses, three plows, six harrows, two carts and fifty-one hectares of land (one hectare equals fifteen mu). Only nine families joined this collective farm. The situation was very difficult, and the rich peasants carried out rumors and sabotage from the beginning. When the products of the first year's harvest were distributed, the rich peasant's running dogs again provoked discord. Some people wavered, and even Dubkovetsky's mother-in-law echoed the bad guys. They "advocated that the grain should be distributed equally according to the total population, and fundamentally opposed the storage of public grain reserves. If this is done, the result will be the demise of the collective farm, and there is no hope of achieving a better life." As a result, three people, including his mother-in-law, withdrew from the collective farm. But this did not defeat Dubkovetsky and his comrades. Even in the most difficult days, they showed unwavering confidence in the collective farm movement.

    Their collective farm was like a young oak seedling, "The strong wind blew on the oak tree, trying to break it, and the biting cold wanted to freeze it to death, but the tree always grew upward, becoming more and more deeply rooted, and the top of the tree also grew luxuriantly in a crisscross pattern." They renamed this collective farm, which was gradually becoming prosperous and beginning to embark on a bright and happy road, "October Revolution Achievements" because they understood that this kind of life was given by the October Revolution.

    These "first agricultural labor groups did not disappoint the expectations of the great socialist leaders Lenin and Stalin. These agricultural labor groups clearly showed the advantages of public socialist agriculture. They used their example to illuminate the road to collective farms for millions of poor and middle peasants." Actual interests educated the farmers, and people visited their collective farm from time to time. Dubkovetsky wrote: "Among the women who came to visit, some heard rumors spread by the rich peasants and were actually looking for large quilts in our place, as if all our male and female members were sleeping together covered by such quilts. After these women witnessed our living conditions, they usually became enthusiastic propagandists for the collective farm system when they returned, and they often took the lead in opposing the rich peasants and personally drove them out of the village." As a result, the former poor and middle peasants voluntarily joined the collective farms in large numbers. They "have become more and more convinced year by year that the road of agricultural development of collective farms is the only correct road for working farmers."

    When the collective farm was established and the members were well-fed and clothed, they were not satisfied with this. Dubkovetsky wrote: "What you have done is only a beginning, only a small part of what you should do. Your life can only be said to be prosperous when compared with the life of farmers who have not joined the collective farm in the past, and when compared with the early days of the collective farm. The conclusion that should be drawn from this is not to be satisfied with the existing achievements, but to move forward without hesitation!" Yes, they are not the kind of people who think that everything is going well once the collective farm is established, but the kind of people who are good at looking forward to a better future from the beautiful scenery. Comrade Stalin once called on: to transform all collective farms into Bolshevik-style collective farms, and to transform all collective farm members into people living a prosperous life! What they are pursuing is such a collective farm. Dubkovetsky gave his heart and soul to the collective farm. He is good at organizing labor, accurately dividing labor, not taking everything on himself, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm, and supporting every useful suggestion. Therefore, the members are full of labor enthusiasm, united and friendly, and the production of crops, animal husbandry and sideline industries is getting better day by day. With the improvement of labor production, the cultural and entertainment needs of the members have also been met. They purchased fixed movie projectors, symphonic instruments and pianos, and equipped a radio broadcasting station.

    Dubkovetsky loves his profession very much, he is not the kind of person who runs around with divided attention. He said: "There are many professions in the world, and each profession has its own advantages." He is dedicated to mastering his career and sincerely and faithfully fulfilling his duties. Therefore, others love and respect him. He was awarded the Order of Lenin, was elected twice as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine.

    This book tells us that the farmers in the Soviet Union are such farmers who, with pride and excitement, are no longer the ignorant farmers who only seek to get a bowl of rice, but the farmers who think about the entire great country in everything, that is, the new socialist type of farmers. They hope to "transform their collective farms into highly developed, well-organized agricultural factories with dozens of compound machines and farm tools working there, that is, into factories that can supply the people with abundant products."

    The better and happier their lives become, the more they thank the Party and Comrade Stalin. Dubkovetsky said: "I should thank him! All my happiness is achieved by relying on our Party, Lenin and Stalin and the people!" Therefore, he listens to the Party's advice, faithfully implements the Party's instructions, accepts the Party's praise, and also accepts the Party's criticism. He is able to humbly and calmly find shortcomings in his work from the great achievements. It is in this way that they make their collective farm always maintain the glorious title of advanced.

    From this book, we can see how great changes have taken place in the lives and thoughts of farmers as a result of the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union. The author wrote: "Our members Anton Belenky and his wife... were unwilling to join the collective farm before, and hesitated. But now they are enthusiastic supporters of the collective farm life, and are propagandists for the socialist system." When Polish farmers came to visit, the couple persuaded the guests in this way: "You must join the collective farm immediately after returning to your country, there is no room for consideration. You have seen our living conditions with your own eyes, we have power stations and radios, and we have white bread, lard, red wine..." In order to make the guests truly believe that the members are living a prosperous life, the couple even led the guests to their storage room, cellar and rooftop room to watch.

    The farmers in the Soviet Union are ardent patriots, they hand over the best grain to the state, and complete the tasks assigned to them by the state very well. They have not forgotten the great help given to them by the working class in the development of agriculture. Therefore, they always provide them with the best pork, ham, wine, butter, candied fruit and sausage, and are concerned that they should also eat fresh vegetables in winter. The workers and farmers of the Soviet Union are combined together in this way, helping each other and caring for each other.

    The Soviet farmers have a high degree of internationalist spirit. They also showed great concern for farmers in other countries. Dubkovetsky said during a visit to Poland: "Our Polish farmer brothers are very lucky because they are moving along the road we have tested. They can avoid the difficulties we have sometimes encountered before." He also said: "What makes us Soviet farmers feel happy is that we have obtained these loyal imitators of Polish farmers." In the last chapter of the book, he further said: "Our tomorrow not only attracts us, but also attracts all advanced mankind. The people of the new democratic countries in the East and the West have already followed our example." This great concern of Soviet farmers, full of deep friendship and brotherhood, will inspire our farmers to better manage mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives under the current conditions, so as to gradually achieve a collectivized living environment like that of Soviet farmers in the future with the development of industry.

    "The Road to Communism" is a very useful book. For every rural worker, it is of great educational significance. After reading this book, I can't help but think of the last sentence of the ballad collectively created by the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative: "Keep Shunda's words in mind, and learn from the Soviet Union." From this book, we can learn a lot and get great inspiration. No wonder this book has been designated as a learning document by a school in Poland that trains chairmen and accountants for agricultural cooperatives.
Correction
    In the article "A Little Experience in Creating 'Southward Expedition and Northward War'" on the third page of this newspaper on April 1, in the twenty-eighth line of the third column, "The Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army..." should be changed to "The Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission...".

    读“到共产主义之路”
    依卡
    苏联杜布科维茨基著莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版
    “到共产主义之路”所叙述的，是关于苏联乌克兰集体农庄运动的事。杜布科维茨基就是这运动的首倡者之一。他通过亲身的经历，生动地描述了乌克兰共和国基也辅省乌曼县“十月革命成果”集体农庄的成长，而且正满怀信心地向着共产主义前进。苏联集体农庄的道路，也就是我国农业发展的前途。因此，从这本书里，我们不但可以了解到他们走过的道路，而且可以学习到集体农庄建设工作者的许多经验。
    这个“十月革命成果”集体农庄是苏联先进的集体农庄之一，庄员们都过着丰裕的美好生活。关于这个情景，用不到多作介绍，只要比较一下旧时俄国农民的生活就可以清楚了。
    杜布科维茨基写道，那时的农民“所关心的是……土地、马匹、耕犁和耙，最后才是他住的茅舍和穿的衣服，很少想到家里的什么设备。睡在板凳上，用瓦罐吃饭，不用洗脸盆洗脸。”而现在“他所想的是要使自己的住房里有家具、无线电、留声机，要使孩子穿戴得好看，并使自己的院子里不是拴着马匹，而是停放着油漆和镀镍发亮的摩托车或脚踏车。你无论到谁的家里去，房屋内都很洁净，有电灯和无线电。男主人在看书或读报，女主人则用电熨斗熨衣服。”这是一种怎样巨大的变化啊！杜布科维茨基感叹地回忆道：“我在本集体农庄内担任主席已有二十九年，但自己往往看不到在此期间内发生的那些重大变化。……先前的庄稼汉是些不识字和闭塞的人，有些人甚至看到火车头时都要恐惧。可是这些‘庄稼汉’现在已掌握了技术和农艺科学，已掌握了一切。”
    但是，他们这种美好生活的获得，并不是轻而易举，而是经过了艰难的斗争历程的。“十月革命成果”集体农庄的前身是“蜂房与蜜蜂”集体农庄，在一九二二年十一月间由杜布科维茨基等同志发起成立。当时的公共财产不过是六匹马、三把犁、六把耙、两辆大车和五十一海克脱土地（一海克脱合十五市亩）。加入这集体农庄的，只有九家人。情况是很困难的，富农在一开始时就进行造谣破坏。当分配第一年收成的产品时，富农走狗又进行挑拨离间。一些人发生动摇了，连杜布科维茨基的岳母也附和坏人。他们“主张把粮食按全数人口平均分配，根本反对储藏公积粮。这样去作，结果就会使集体农庄灭亡，就根本不能希望达到优美生活。”结果有三个人连同他的岳母退出了集体农庄。但这并没有把杜布科维茨基和他的同志们难倒。即使在最困难的日子，他们也表现了对集体农庄运动坚定不移的信心。
    他们的集体农庄好像一棵橡树的幼小树秧，“狂风吹袭着橡树，企图把它摧折，刺骨的严寒想把它冻死，但是树木总是向上生长，日益根深蒂固，树顶也横竖交叉着繁茂生长”。他们把这逐渐丰裕起来、开始走上光明幸福道路的集体农庄，改名为“十月革命成果”，因为他们懂得这种生活是十月革命给予的。
    他们这些“首批农业劳动组合没有辜负社会主义伟大领袖列宁和斯大林底期望。这些农业劳动组合显然表明了公营社会主义农业底优点。它们以自己的榜样，向千百万贫农和中农照明了进入集体农庄的道路。”实际的利益教育了农民，不时有人去参观他们的集体农庄。杜布科维茨基写道：“前来参观的妇女中间，有些人因听到过富农散布的谣言，竟在我们这里寻找大被窝，仿佛我们这里的男女社员大家都盖着这种被窝混在一块儿睡觉。这些妇女目睹了我们的生活情形之后，回去时通常都成了拥护集体农庄制度的热烈宣传员，她们往往首先起来反对富农，并亲自把富农从村中赶跑。”于是，先前的贫农和中农，才自愿地大批大批加入了集体农庄。他们“已逐年更加深信，集体农庄的农业发展道路对于劳动农民是唯一正确的道路”。
    当集体农庄已经建立起来，庄员们都已穿得暖吃得饱了。但是，他们并不以此为满足。杜布科维茨基写道：“你们作到的事情还不过是一个开端，还不过是你应作的事情中的一小部分。你们的生活只是与过去农民尚未加入集体农庄时的那种生活相比较，与集体农庄存在的初期相比较，才可说是丰裕的。由此应该得出的结论，就是不要以已有的成绩为满足，而要一往直前地前进！”是的，他们不是那种一旦建立起集体农庄就万事大吉的人，而是那种善于从美好的光景中向着将来更美好日子眺望的人。斯大林同志曾经号召：把一切集体农庄都变成为布尔什维克式的集体农庄，把一切集体农庄庄员都变成为生活丰裕的人！他们所追求的，就是这样的集体农庄。杜布科维茨基把自己的心血全交给了集体农庄。他善于组织劳动，精确分工，不包揽一切，鼓励大家的热情，支持每个有益的建议，因而庄员们都充满劳动热情，团结友爱，使庄稼、畜牧和副业生产搞得一天比一天好。劳动生产搞好了，庄员们文化娱乐方面的需要也得到了满足。他们购买了固定的电影机、交响乐器和钢琴，并装备了无线电播音站。
    杜布科维茨基非常热爱自己的职业，他不是那种三心二意跑来跑去的人。他说：“人世间有许多职业，每一行职业都有它自己的优点。”他专心精通自己的事业，诚恳而忠实地履行自己的职责。因此，别人都爱戴他、尊敬他。他曾荣获列宁勋章，两次当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表，并被选为乌克兰共产党（布）的中央候补委员。
    这本书告诉我们，苏联的农民是这样的农民，他们怀着自豪和兴奋的心情，已不是先前那种只求弄到一碗饭吃的闭塞的庄稼汉，而是凡事都为整个伟大国家设想的庄稼人，即新的社会主义类型的庄稼人。他们希望“把自己的集体农庄变为高度发展的、组织完善的、有数十架复式机器与农具在那里工作的农业工厂，即变为能供给人民丰裕产品的工厂。”
    他们的日子愈过得好，愈幸福，就愈感谢党和斯大林同志。杜布科维茨基说：“我应当向他致谢！我的一切幸福，都是凭靠我们党，列宁和斯大林及人民才达到的啊！”因此他听信党的忠告，忠实地执行党的指示，接受党的称赞，也接受党的批评，他能够从巨大的成绩中谦虚而冷静地寻找工作中的缺点。他们就是这样地，使自己的集体农庄，永远保持着先进的光荣称号。
    从这本书里，我们可以看到苏联农业集体化使农民的生活和思想发生了多么巨大的变化。作者写道：“我们的庄员安东·贝连基和他的妻子，……先前不愿加入集体农庄，踌躇不决。而现在他们已是热烈拥护集体农庄生活的人了，已是拥护社会主义制度的宣传家了。”当波兰农民来参观的时候，他们俩口子就这样地劝导来宾说：“你们回国后要立刻加入集体农庄，没有什么考虑的余地。你们亲眼看到我们的生活情形，我们有电站和无线电收音机，有白面包、脂油、红酒……”为要使来宾确实相信庄员们过的丰裕生活起见，他们俩口子甚至领来宾到自己的贮藏室、地窖及房顶室内去观看。
    苏联的农民是热烈的爱国主义者，他们把最好的粮食交纳给国家，很好地完成国家交给他们的任务。他们没有忘记工人阶级在发展农业上给他们的巨大帮助。所以，他们总是把最好的猪肉、火腿、酒、黄油、蜜饯和香肠等供给他们，并且关心到使他们在冬天也应该吃到新鲜的蔬菜。苏联的工人和农民，就是这样互相帮助彼此关心地结合在一起的。
    苏联农民是具有高度的国际主义精神的。他们对于其他国家的农民，也表现了极大的关心。杜布科维茨基在波兰参观时说：“我们的波兰农民兄弟很走运气，因为他们是沿着我们考验过的道路迈进。他们可以避免我们先前有时遇到过的那些困难。”他还说：“使我们苏联农民感觉快乐的，是我们获得了波兰农民这些忠诚的仿效者。”在本书的最后一章中，他更说：“我国的明天不仅引诱着我们，而且引诱着全体先进人类。仿照着我国榜样迈进的，已有东方和西方各新民主国家的人民。”苏联农民这种充满深厚友情的兄弟般的伟大关怀，将鼓舞着我国的农民在目前的条件下，更好地搞好互助组、农业生产合作社，以便随着工业的发展，在将来逐渐达到像苏联农民那样的集体化的生活环境。
    “到共产主义之路”是一本十分有益的书。对于每个农村工作者来说，它更是有很大教育意义的。读了这本书，我不由地想起李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社集体创作的歌谣的末一句：“顺达的话记心间，还要好好学苏联。”从这本书中，我们就可以学到很多东西，得到很大的启发。无怪这本书已被波兰一所为农业合作社培养主席和会计员的学校，指定为学习的文件了。更    正
    四月一日本报第三版“创作‘南征北战’的一点心得”一文中的第三栏第二十八行，“在中国人民解放军军委总政治部文化部……”应改成“在人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部……”。
