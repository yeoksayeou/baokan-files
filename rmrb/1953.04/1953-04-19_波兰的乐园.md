    Poland's Paradise
    Zou Difan
    Starting from Warsaw
    Our stay in Poland was not long, but we were deeply impressed by her rapid growth in all aspects and the happy life of her people. During the Second World War, Poland suffered severe damage, especially the capital, Warsaw. But in just a few years, Warsaw has recovered. We saw the towering buildings of Constitution Avenue. Every window proclaims the happiness of the workers. The construction of the subway is proceeding day and night, with the first line scheduled to open in 1955. The second line will open in 1956. The Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet Union to the city of Warsaw, began construction last June. This twenty-eight-story building, 220 meters high, will be completed in 1955. When we were in Warsaw, we took a look near the construction site. The long arms of the twelve towering cranes were all equipped with electric lights at night, continuing to work. When they moved, they looked like several large buildings moving, magnificent and grand.
    The construction work in Warsaw is progressing every day, and its appearance is changing every day. When we were in Warsaw, we heard such a joke: a young couple made an appointment at a small coffee shop in the morning to meet at the same place at 7:00 p.m. that day; but when evening came, they couldn't find the original place. It was later discovered that a new building had occupied the original site of the coffee shop. This is of course just a joke, but it also shows the pleasant mood of the people of Warsaw at work. This is a humor full of optimism arising from the significant achievements of construction.
    Obviously, the assistance of the Soviet Union and the labor of the Polish people are quickly making Warsaw a paradise for the people.
        Nowa Huta – A New Steel City
    Nowa Huta means a new steel city. This is a new industrial city built from the ground up.
    This new city is built near the southern city of Krakow. Here, there are many scattered individual farmers who can be absorbed into the industrial sector; at the same time, in this area, which originally had no large industry, there are extremely rich coal mines, and the water of the Vistula River can be fully utilized. Therefore, the material conditions for establishing a brand-new industrial city are fully available. By 1955, the steel production in this one place alone will exceed the steel production of the entire Poland before the war.
    The fact that the establishment of such a large-scale new city can quickly achieve remarkable results is inseparable from the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin. According to an engineer who established Nowa Huta, not to mention how many machines and materials were shipped from the Soviet Union, just in terms of the technology for building this city, the Soviet Union sent 700 experts to guide and assist in the construction work. If this were not the case, even if all the experts in Poland were concentrated to do this work, only a quarter of the project could be completed in the same amount of time.
    How big is Nowa Huta in area? How big is the project? According to Polish friends, it would take 35 kilometers to walk around the city. If the earth excavated and transported during the construction of this project were loaded into train cars, it could reach all the way from Warsaw to Beijing.
    The construction of this new type of factory and city has also cultivated a large number of technicians and cadres for Poland. Among the construction personnel, 75 percent of the construction workers are young people, of which 50 percent are farmers. Needless to say, these farmers will all be transferred to the industrial sector in the future.
    The entire city of Nowa Huta is divided into several areas, and the factory area and the residential area are completely isolated. In order to prevent the smoke from the factory area from invading the residential area, afforestation is being vigorously carried out between the two areas. The residential area is divided into several districts, each of which can accommodate 5,000 to 6,000 people, and the entire district can accommodate 75,000 people. The first district is independent, with shops, schools, etc. The architecture of the entire district adopts a "mountain peak" style, with buildings becoming taller towards the city center.
    This new type of city has theaters, cinemas, sports fields, swimming pools, hospitals, and a central cultural palace. Currently, there are six vocational schools related to the steel industry in this new city.
    We visited an ordinary worker's family, which was a three-story building. When we walked to the door, two little girls smiled and waved to us from the window. When we entered the owner's small parlor, we saw Polish tapestries and reproductions of famous paintings hanging on the wall, applied technology and literary books on the bookshelf, and the sofa was not new, but very practical and comfortable. The male owner was not at home, and the female owner did not expect us to visit. When we went upstairs, the female owner was cooking in the kitchen, which used gas. The family of four used a total of three rooms in addition to the kitchen, one as a parlor, two as bedrooms, and a bathroom. Polish friends said: Currently, workers here can earn 800 to 2,000 zlotys (Polish currency), and the rent is only 50 to 60 zlotys.
    Stalinogród's Cultural Center
    Stalinogród is the largest steel city in Poland, formerly known as Katowice. After the death of Comrade Stalin, it was renamed Stalinogród in memory of this great mentor of the world's progressive humanity. When we went to visit, our Polish friends told us on the train: "In Katowice, everything is black. You know, there are really too many steel factories. The smoke from the factories has blackened everything, the walls are black, the roof tiles are black, the trees are black, and even the snow floating in the air in winter has turned black."
    The cultural center in this large industrial area is still only experimental. Its main task is to provide workers with cultural entertainment during rest and to assist factory clubs in doing organizational work. Its activities include cultural education, current affairs study, academic lectures, music, dance, drama, movies, etc. The cultural center announces the activities every two weeks. According to the responsible comrade of the cultural center, they recently held a lecture on Chinese issues and showed slides introducing China. Not long ago, they also held a Chinese cultural evening, where Chinese music was played and Zhao Shuli's novel "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" was recited. Experts also explained the situation in Chinese rural areas. The book club recommended Ding Ling's novel "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" as one of the must-read literary works. In 1952, they held six reports on Chinese issues.
    When we went to visit, the theater was rehearsing a play by Gorky. The male lead was played by a worker, and the female lead was a student from a drama school. The director was extremely serious, and the actors were full of sincere emotions. We also walked into the accordion training class, where they skillfully played "The Hearts of the People of the World Are One." In the office of the art department, there were many scripts, patterns of ethnic costumes, various musical scores, and photos of various performances. We walked into the library and the collection of books in the center. The comrade in charge of the library told us that there were 45,000 general books and 200,000 specialized books.
    An average of 3,000 workers participate in various activities at the cultural center every day. 16,000 people participated in the dance party on New Year's Day this year.
        Zakopane, a Winter Resort
    Polish friends call Zakopane "the winter capital of Poland." This is because the scenery here is exceptionally beautiful in winter, and many people on vacation come here to spend their holidays. There are thirty sanatoriums here, each with an average of ninety beds; there are ten tuberculosis sanatoriums, which can accommodate 300 people for treatment. Here is also the southern Tatra Mountains of Poland, a good place for skiing and the center of winter sports. Therefore, it becomes lively here every winter.
    The day after we arrived in Zakopane, it was a beautiful sunny day. We came out of a rest villa in a carriage. The mountains and valleys were covered with white snow, but the streams were still ringing in the gullies. The branches of the pine trees were like white phoenix tails, shimmering with beautiful colors in the sun. A row of neat wooden houses by the mountainside were covered with snow. The scenery here is beautiful and the environment is quiet.
    Along the way, we saw many young men and women, some skiing, some singing in carriages. Polish friends told us that in the past only the bourgeoisie could come here, but now they are all workers and cadres.
    On several hillsides, we saw skiers jumping down from slopes seven or eight zhang high like flying, and then smoothly sliding past the foot of the mountain, which showed the health and joy of the Polish people.
    We reached the top of the mountain by funicular. At the top of the mountain, there is a beautiful and popular dining room. People were laughing there, resting and vacationing without worry. Looking from the top of the mountain, the deep blue sky was added with a touch of light red, a touch of light yellow, and some other colors, while the foot of the mountain and the surrounding peaks were so white and flawless.
    We also visited a children's tuberculosis sanatorium in this place. The children were treated in bed and studied at the same time. In order to prevent the children's lives from being isolated from the outside world as much as possible during their studies, they often increased the children's social knowledge through movies, slides, and lectures. When we walked into the sanatorium, several children in the wards were sitting or lying in bed studying, and the teacher was lecturing. When we walked into one of the rooms, the children immediately started singing a song, which was a
  "Song of Chinese Children." A few lines of the song are like this: I am a Chinese child, I reach out my hand to shake hands with you. There are children of many nationalities all over the world, there are black children, white children... they all reach out their hands for peace.
    Hearing such songs sung by the children in the sanatorium quickly made us feel a sense of responsibility for defending peace and the responsibility we should fulfill for the younger generation.
    Seeing these unfortunate sick children being taken care of with utmost care in such a beautiful environment, seeing the working young men and women happily skiing on the white snow, and seeing the people in the sanatorium sitting by the windows basking in the warm sun, we were happy for them. Yes, this is a recreation area, sports field, and paradise for the Polish working people.

    波兰的乐园
    邹荻帆
    从华沙说起
    我们留在波兰的时间并不长，但她的各方面迅速成长的情况，以及她的人民愉快幸福的生活却给我们极深的印象。在第二次世界大战期中，波兰受到严重的破坏，特别是首都华沙。但在短短的几年中，华沙恢复起来了。我们看到宪法大街的巍峨的高楼大厦。每一扇窗子都标明着工人的幸福。地下铁道的建筑工作正在日以继夜地进行，第一条线路将于一九五五年通车。一九五六年第二条线路将要通车。苏联赠送给华沙城的文化科学宫，从去年六月动工。这座二十八层的建筑物，高达二百二十公尺，将于一九五五年完成。我们在华沙的时候，曾经在工地近旁看了一下。十二架高耸入云的起重机的长臂上，在夜间都装满电灯，继续工作。当它们移动时，真像几座大建筑物在移动，壮丽而伟大。
    华沙城的建设工作每天都在进展着，它的面貌每天都在改变着。我们在华沙时听到过这样一个笑话：有一对年青的情人，他们早晨在一座小咖啡店约好了，当天晚上七点钟仍在原地会面；但到了晚上，他们却怎么也找不到原来的地方了。后来才发现，一座新的建筑物已占用了咖啡店的原址。这当然只是一个笑话，但也说明了华沙人民劳动的愉快的情绪。这是由于建设得到了重大成绩而产生的充满乐观精神的幽默。
    很显然，苏联的协助和波兰人民的劳动创造，很快地使华沙成为人民的乐园。
        诺伐·胡塔——新的钢铁城
    诺伐·胡塔就是新的钢铁城的意思。这是从平地建立起来的一座新的工业城市。
    这座新城建立在南方克拉科夫城的附近。在这里，有着很多分散的个体农民，可以吸收到工业部门来；同时在这个原来没有大工业的区域里，有极丰富的煤矿，维斯杜拉河的流水又可以充分利用。因此，建立一座崭新的工业城市的物质条件是完全具备的。到一九五五年时，仅仅这一个地方的产钢量，就要超过战前波兰全国的产钢量。
    建立这样一座大规模的新城，能够很快地得到显著的成绩，是与苏联和斯大林同志慷慨无私的帮助分不开的。据建立诺伐·胡塔的一位工程师对我们说，且不论从苏联运来了多少机器和物资，只就建立这一城市的技术上说，苏联就派了七百个专家来指导和协助建设工作。如果不是这样，即使集中波兰全国的专家来做这项工作，在同样长短的时间内，也只能完成四分之一的工程。
    诺伐·胡塔的面积到底有多大呢？工程究竟有多大呢？据波兰朋友们说，如果围着这个城转一周，就要走三十五公里。这次在修建工程中所挖运的土方如果装上火车厢，可以一直从华沙接到北京。
    建设这个新型工厂和城市，也为波兰培养出了大批技术工人和干部。在建设人员中，百分之七十五的建设工人是青年，其中农民占百分之五十。不用说，以后这些农民就都将转移到工业部门去了。
    诺伐·胡塔全城分成几个区域，工厂区和住宅区是完全隔离的。为了避免工厂区的煤烟侵入住宅区，在两个区域之间正在大力造林。住宅区又分成几个区，每一区可以住五、六千人，全区可住七万五千人。第一区是独立的，有商店，学校等。全区的建筑是采取“山峰式”的形式，愈到市中心建筑就愈高。
    这座新型的城市有剧院、电影院、运动场、游泳池、医院和一座中央文化宫等。目前在这座新城就有六所关于钢铁工业方面的职业学校。
    我们曾参观过一个普通工人的家庭，这是一座三层的楼房。当我们走到门边的时候，两个小女孩就在窗口笑着和我们招手，走进主人的小会客室就看到墙上挂着的波兰织锦和复制的名画，书架上放着应用技术的和文艺的书籍，沙发虽不是新的，但很实用、舒适。男主人并不在家，女主人也并没有想到我们会来造访。我们上楼的时候，女主人正在厨房烹饪，厨房是使用煤气的。一家四人除厨房外共使用了三间房，一间做会客室，两间做卧房，并带有卫生间。波兰的朋友说：目前在这里的工人可以拿到八百到二千兹特罗（波币），房租只要五十到六十兹罗特。
    斯大林诺格罗德的文化馆
    斯大林诺格罗德是波兰最大的钢铁城，原名卡托维兹。斯大林同志逝世后，为了纪念这位世界进步人类的伟大导师，改名为斯大林诺格罗德。我们去参观时，在火车上波兰的朋友们就告诉我们说：“在卡托维兹，什么都是黑的。你知道，钢铁工厂实在是太多了。工厂的煤烟把一切都薰黑了，墙壁是黑的，屋瓦是黑的，树木是黑的，连冬天里飘在空中的雪也都变成了黑色。”
    这个大工业区的文化馆还只是带着试验性的，它的主要任务是要使工人们在休息时有文化娱乐，并协助工厂俱乐部做些组织工作。它的活动内容包括文化教育、时事学习、学术讲座、音乐舞蹈、戏剧电影等等。文化馆每两周公布一次活动的项目。据文化馆的负责同志告诉我们，不久以前他们曾举行了关于中国问题的讲座，并放映了介绍中国的幻灯片。又前不久还曾举行过中国文艺晚会，晚会上演奏过中国音乐，并朗诵了赵树理的小说“小二黑结婚”。专家还讲解了中国农村的情况。读书会里把丁玲的小说“太阳照在桑乾河上”推荐为必读的文艺作品之一。在一九五二年内，他们举行过六次关于中国问题的报告。
    当我们去参观时，剧场里正在排演高尔基的一个剧本。饰演男主角的是一个工人，女主角则是戏剧学校的学生。导演极其认真，演员更充满着真挚的感情。我们又走进手风琴训练班，他们很娴熟地演奏着“全世界人民心一条”。艺术部的办公室里，陈列着许多剧本、民族服装的图样、各种乐谱以及各次演出情况的照片。我们走进馆里的图书馆和藏书库，图书馆负责同志告诉我们，这里一般的图书有四万五千册，各种专门图书有二十万册。
    每天来文化馆参加各项活动的工人平均有三千人。今年新年来参加跳舞晚会的就有一万六千人。
        冬季疗养胜地查库邦尼
    波兰朋友们把查库邦尼称做“波兰冬季的首都”。这是因为到了冬天的时候，这里的风景异常优美，很多休假的人都到这里来度假期。这里有三十个休养院，每一院平均有九十个床位；有十个肺病疗养院，可以容三百人疗养。这里又是波兰南方特塔尔山区，是滑雪的好地方，是冬季运动的中心。因此每到冬季，这里就热闹起来了。
    我们到达查库邦尼的次日，正是大好的晴天。我们坐着马车从一座休憩别墅出来。山上山下都铺满了洁白的雪，但流泉还在山沟里响着。松树的枝条像白色的凤尾一样，在阳光下闪着美丽的颜色。山边一排平整的木屋都被雪覆盖着。这里景色优美，环境宁静。
    一路上，我们看见很多青年男女，有的滑着雪撬，有的驾着马车在唱歌。波兰朋友告诉我们，过去这里是只有资产阶级才能来的，现在则都是工人和干部。
    在好几处的山腰里，我们看见滑雪的人从七、八丈高的山坡上飞一般跳下来，而后平稳地从山脚一旁滑过去，这表现了波兰人民的健康和愉快。
    我们坐爬山电车到达了山顶。在山顶上有着优美而大众化的大餐室。人们在那里说笑，无牵无挂地在休憩和度假。从山顶远望，深蓝的天边，又加上了一片淡红、一片淡黄和一些其他的色彩，而山脚下和四围的山峰是那样洁白无瑕。
    我们还参观了这地方的一座结核病儿童疗养院。孩子们一面在床上治病，一面学习。在学习中为了尽量使孩子们的生活不与外界隔绝，经常通过电影、幻灯、讲解，增加孩子们的社会常识。当我们走进疗养院时，有好几个病室里的孩子们都坐在或躺在床上学习，教师正在讲解。有一个室内的孩子们在我们走进去的时候，立即唱起了歌来，唱的是一首
  “中国孩子的歌”。那歌辞有几句是这样的：我是一个中国孩子，我伸出手来和你们握手。全世界很多的民族都有孩子，有黑孩子、白孩子……他们都伸出手来要和平。
    听到在疗养院的孩子们所唱的这样的歌，很快使我们感到对保卫和平的责任，以及对幼小一代所应该尽的责任。
    看到这些不幸生病的孩子们在这样优美的环境中受到极其周到的照顾，看到劳动的青年男女快乐地在洁白的雪上滑雪，看到休养所的人们坐在窗子边晒着温暖的太阳，我们就为他们欣喜。是的，这里是波兰劳动人民的休憩所、运动场和乐园。
