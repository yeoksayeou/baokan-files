Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 23rd: In the five days from April 16th to 20th, the Korean and Chinese People's forces achieved a series of victories in battles northwest of Lianchuan, south of Shuoning, and south of Gao Cheng on the eastern front.

　　The fierce battle at North Mountain, Shixian Cave, northwest of Lianchuan, lasted for two days and two nights, during which our army annihilated over 700 American soldiers of the 7th Division. The battle for this hill started on the night of the 16th. Our attacking troops, coordinated with powerful artillery and tank forces, captured this hill and several other positions in one fell swoop, wiping out many enemy soldiers defending the hill. On the morning of the 17th, an enemy company, under the cover of heavy artillery fire and smoke screens, frantically counterattacked North Mountain, Shixian Cave, but was repelled by our army with various infantry weapons and fierce artillery fire. Later, the enemy launched a counterattack with a battalion, but as soon as they climbed to the foot of the mountain, they were subjected to intensive bombardment by our mortars. Our army repelled many enemy assaults, killing or wounding more than 500 enemy soldiers. On the 18th, the enemy continued to launch frantic counterattacks, and our army killed or wounded more than 200 enemy soldiers on the west side of the main peak. Before dawn on the 19th, after annihilating more than 700 enemy soldiers, our army withdrew from this hill and returned to its own positions. Adding this achievement to the results of our army's two attacks on North Mountain, Shixian Cave, in March, our army has annihilated nearly 1,000 American soldiers of the 7th Division on this hill.

　　During these five days, the enemy launched two major offensives on the western and eastern fronts. On the morning of the 18th, the enemy used two companies to continuously attack one of our army's positions south of Shuoning seven times, each time retreating in defeat under the head-on blow of our army. Before dawn on the 19th, the enemy bombarded one of our army's positions near Deshan-ri, south of Gao Cheng on the east coast, with artillery fire, and then the enemy launched an attack from both sides of our army's position with a company. But when the enemy approached the front of our army's position, they were suddenly attacked by our ambush troops, and the enemy retreated in panic, abandoning 37 corpses and many items such as light machine guns, automatic rifles, and bulletproof vests.

　　In the five days from April 16th to 20th, our army's frontline mobile artillery killed or wounded 713 enemy soldiers; frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down four enemy planes and damaged 36 enemy planes.

　　我军在石岘洞北山两天歼美军七百多名
    五天中我前线高射炮火击落击伤敌机四十架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】四月十六日到二十日的五天中，朝中人民部队在涟川西北、朔宁以南和东线高城以南等地的战斗中，取得一连串的胜利。
    涟川西北石岘洞北山的激烈战斗进行了两天两夜，我军共计歼灭美军第七师七百多名。这个山头的战斗是在十六日夜间开始的，我军攻击部队在强大炮火和坦克部队的配合下，一举攻占了这个山头和其他几个阵地，歼灭了许多守山的敌人。十七日早晨，一个连的敌人在大量炮火和烟幕的掩护下向石岘洞北山疯狂地进行反扑，被我军以各种步兵火器和猛烈的炮火击退；以后敌人又以一个营的兵力向我军反扑，但敌人刚爬到山脚，就又遭到我军迫击炮火的密集轰击。我军打退了敌人多次冲锋，先后杀伤敌人五百多名。十八日，敌人继续进行疯狂的反扑，我军又在主峰西侧杀伤敌人二百多人。十九日天亮以前，我军在歼敌七百多人后，撤出这个山头，回到自己的阵地上。把这次战果和三月份我军两次攻打石岘洞北山的战果加在一起，我军在这个山头上已歼灭美军第七师近一千人。
    在这五天中，敌人在西线和东线发动了两次较大的进攻。十八日早晨，敌人以两个连的兵力向朔宁以南我军的一个阵地连续攻击七次，每次都在我军的迎头痛击下败退。十九日天明前，敌人用炮火向东海岸高城以南德山里附近我军的一个阵地轰击，然后敌人以一个连兵力从我军阵地两侧发动进攻。但当敌人逼近我军阵地前沿时，遭到了我军伏击部队的突然打击，敌人狼狈败退，并丢弃了三十七具尸首和轻机枪、自动步枪、避弹衣等许多东西。
    十六日到二十日五天中，我军前线游动炮火击毙击伤敌军七百十三名；前线高射炮火击落敌机四架，击伤敌机三十六架。
