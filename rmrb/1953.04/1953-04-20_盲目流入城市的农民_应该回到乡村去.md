Farmers Blindly Flowing into Cities Should Return to the Countryside

Since the Spring Festival this year, large numbers of farmers in many regions have been blindly flowing into cities. According to statistics from the beginning of this month, more than 50,000 farmers have newly flowed into several major cities from the countryside; and many farmers are still moving along transportation lines. This not only increases the difficulties of urban work and transportation, but also seriously hinders the current spring plowing and production. Party and government leading organs in various regions must pay great attention to this issue, conscientiously implement the instructions of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on dissuading farmers from blindly flowing into cities, and quickly take appropriate measures to stop the development of this phenomenon.

The arbitrary recruitment of workers from rural areas by some construction units is one of the important reasons for this phenomenon. Therefore, we must strengthen the planning of labor mobilization and use, and correct the phenomenon of unplanned and unorganized activity. Our country's construction period has already begun, and the need to absorb labor from rural areas to participate in economic construction will undoubtedly gradually increase. Many rural cadres and farmers, especially young farmers, are willing to come to the cities to participate in the country's industrial construction, which is also very natural. However, we should recognize that the country's economic construction must be carried out in a planned and organized manner. It is impossible to absorb a large amount of labor at once, and the use and mobilization of labor must also have a certain plan and organization. All industrial and mining enterprises and construction units should accurately calculate the number of workers they need and submit it to the local labor administration department for unified allocation. The people's governments of counties, districts, and townships should patiently explain to the farmers who are preparing to enter the city, explaining that blindly entering the city is not good for the country or themselves, and persuade them to develop production at home with peace of mind.

We should educate county and district cadres and the broad masses of farmers to understand the correct relationship between industry and agriculture and oppose the one-sided view of neglecting and belittling agricultural production. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said in its instructions to party committees at all levels on spring plowing production: "In order to meet the needs of the continuous development of our country's industrial production, we must also continuously improve the level of agricultural production even further, and we must never stop at the existing achievements and no longer move forward. In the high tide of industrial construction, any view that neglects agricultural production is one-sided and wrong." Of course, agriculture must have major development, and it must have the leadership and support of industry; but the development of industry also needs the support of agriculture. In the country's economic construction, the importance of agriculture is by no means less than in the past; on the contrary, cities and industries increasingly need large quantities of commercial grain and industrial raw materials, and need a larger market for sales. Therefore, we must continue to give play to the production enthusiasm of farmers and further develop agricultural production.

We should educate farmers to actively exert the potential power of surplus rural labor and develop a diversified rural economy, build small-scale water conservancy projects, improve farming techniques, renovate land, improve soil, plant trees and forests, develop animal husbandry, and conditionally carry out various marketable sideline productions. To this end, it is necessary to help farmers open up sales channels for local and special products, and appropriately adjust the prices of agricultural and sideline products and local and special products. And within the scope of the country's financial resources, we should plan to build roads, dredge rivers, and construct large-scale water conservancy projects. These things can accommodate a group of rural laborers and are directly related to the interests of farmers; but the working conditions of these projects must be appropriately improved. In addition, we must correctly implement the various policies of the Party and the People's Government, especially resolutely correct the behavior of not respecting farmers' private property rights, improve the working methods and styles of rural work cadres, and effectively correct the phenomenon of "five excesses" so that farmers can truly be at ease in production, and district and village cadres can have the conditions to lead production. These are some necessary measures to stabilize the mood of farmers in production and make them feel at ease in rural production.

For the farmers who have blindly flowed into the cities, we should properly and carefully handle them in accordance with the State Council's instructions on dissuading farmers from blindly flowing into the cities. Except for those who are indeed needed by industrial, mining and construction engineering units, the labor and civil affairs departments of the local people's governments should mobilize them to return to their hometowns. The party committees of various cities should uniformly lead this work. All personnel freely recruited by industrial and mining enterprises who are not currently needed should be handled by the units responsible for them; and, in conjunction with the counties, districts, and township people's governments that originally introduced these farmers to the cities, negotiate appropriate methods to welcome the farmers home. Rural party members, members of the Communist Youth League, village cadres, and honorary soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers who have been employed in rural areas and who have blindly and spontaneously entered the city should play an exemplary role and return to their hometowns as soon as possible to lead spring plowing production. Spring plowing and sowing have already begun in many areas, and time is already very tight. A delay of a few more days may affect the harvest for the year. All rural cadres and farmers who should return to their hometowns should no longer be indecisive, and should hurry back to the glorious agricultural production front and rural work posts.

### 盲目流入城市的农民  应该回到乡村去

    盲目流入城市的农民
    应该回到乡村去
    今年春节以来，许多地区有大批农民盲目地流向城市。据本月初统计，新由农村流入几个大城市的农民约在五万人以上；还有许多农民正在交通线上流动着。这既增加了城市工作和交通运输的困难，又严重地妨碍了当前的春耕生产。各地党政领导机关必须十分重视这个问题，认真执行中央人民政府政务院关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示，迅速采取妥善的措施，停止这个现象的发展。
    某些建筑单位随意到农村招揽工人，是造成这种现象的重要原因之一。因此，我们必须加强对劳动力动员和使用的计划性，纠正无计划无组织的现象。我们国家的建设时期业已开始，从农村吸收劳动力参加经济建设的需要，无疑将是逐渐增加的。许多农村干部和农民群众，特别是青年农民，愿意到城市来参加国家的工业建设，这也是很自然的。可是，我们应当认识，国家的经济建设必须有计划、有组织地进行，不可能一下子吸收很多劳动力，同时对于劳动力的使用和动员，也必须有一定的计划和组织。各工矿企业、建筑单位应当精确地计算出自己所需要的工人数目，交由当地劳动行政部门统一地加以调配；各地县、区、乡人民政府则应向准备进城的农民耐心地进行解释，说明盲目地进城对国家对自己都没有好处，劝告他们在家安心发展生产。
    我们应当教育县区干部和广大农民，使他们了解工业和农业的正确关系，反对忽视和轻视农业生产的片面观点。中共中央在关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示中说：“为了配合我们国家工业生产不断发展的需要，就必须同时不断地更进一步地提高农业生产水平，绝不能停留在现有成绩上不再前进。在工业建设的高潮之中，任何忽视农业生产的观点，都是片面的，错误的。”当然，农业要有重大的发展，必须有工业的领导和支援；但工业的发展同样需要农业的支持。在国家经济建设中，农业的重要性决不比过去为小，相反的，城市和工业日益增多地需要大量的商品粮食和工业原料，需要销售量更大的市场。因此，我们必须继续发挥农民的生产积极性，进一步发展农业生产。
    我们应当教育农民，积极发挥农村剩余劳动的潜在力量，发展农村多种经济，兴修小型水利、改良耕作技术、整修土地、改良土壤、植树造林、发展畜牧和有条件地进行各种有销路的副业生产。为此，就需要帮助农民打开土产特产品的销路，适当地调整农产品副业产品和土产特产品的价格。并应在国家财力可能的范围内，有计划地修筑道路、疏浚河道和建设大型水利工程，这些事情可容纳一批农村劳动力，也和农民的利益有直接关系；但必须适当地改善这些工程的劳动条件。此外，必须端正地执行党和人民政府的各种政策，特别是要坚决纠正不尊重农民财产私有权的行为，改进农村工作干部的工作方法和作风，切实纠正“五多”现象，使农民真正能安心生产，使区村干部能够有条件领导生产。这些都是安定农民生产情绪，使他们安心在农村生产的一些必要措施。
    对于目前已经盲目地流入城市的农民，我们应当按照政务院关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示，妥善地慎重地加以处理。除为工矿企业和建筑工程单位确实需要的以外，应由所在地人民政府的劳动部门、民政部门动员他们回乡。各个城市的党委应当统一地领导这一工作。凡是各工矿企业自由招来而目前并不需要的人员，应一律由各该单位负责处理；并协同原来介绍这些农民到城市来的各县、区、乡人民政府，商定妥善办法，迎接农民回家。盲目地自流地进入城市的农村党员、团员、村干部和已在农村就业的荣誉军人、退伍转业军人，应当起模范作用，尽快回乡领导春耕生产。春耕播种在许多地区已经开始了，时间已经很紧迫了，再耽误几天就可能影响一年的收成，所有应该回乡的农村干部和农民都不应该再三心二意了，要赶快回到光荣的农业生产战线和农村工作岗位上去。
