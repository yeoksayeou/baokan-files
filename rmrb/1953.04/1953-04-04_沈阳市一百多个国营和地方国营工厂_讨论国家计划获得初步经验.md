    Shenyang News Agency: More Than One Hundred State-Owned and Locally State-Owned Factories in Shenyang City Discuss National Plans and Gain Preliminary Experience.
    [Our Newspaper] Since late January, more than one hundred state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Shenyang City have successively launched work to discuss national plans and formulate specific action plans. By the end of March, most state-owned factories had completed the initial stage, achieving considerable success and experience.
    The situation of plan discussions in various state-owned factories can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category fully mobilized the masses, the plan discussions were more detailed, more "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) were discovered, more problems were solved, and the gains were relatively large. Factories in this category accounted for about 30%. The second category discussed the plans more seriously, and the gains were also relatively large, but there were still many shortcomings. They started discussing the plans later, and therefore ended later. Factories in this category accounted for about 43%. The third category discussed the plans hastily and procrastinated, took detours, did not mobilize the masses sufficiently, made slow progress, gained little, and had more serious conservative thinking. Factories in this category accounted for about 27%. In addition, a few units, because the plans were formulated late, or were rushing to complete temporary and urgent tasks, have not yet formally discussed the national plans.
    Some units in the first and second categories have not only formulated relatively advanced action plans, but also formulated specific measures plans to ensure the implementation of the plans, and revised or are revising the patriotic pacts of the groups. Some of them have already signed collective contracts, and most are preparing for collective contract signing.
    The gains of state-owned factories in the first and second categories in mobilizing employees to discuss national plans are mainly reflected in: The political and ideological awareness of all employees has been further improved. They are determined to more actively meet the new tasks of the new era. Therefore, they have overcome conservative ideas, greatly tapped the potential of enterprises, and formulated more advanced specific action plans. The entire factory, workshops, groups, and individuals all have clear and specific goals (generally including several aspects such as output, quality, cost, finance, and technology). For example, the specific action plan formulated by Factory 53 after discussion increased output by 15% compared to the national plan, improved quality by 0.6241%, and reduced costs by 4%. The water pump task stipulated in the national plan of Machine Factory 6 had already increased by 68.22% compared to last year. After discussion, it increased by another 28.52% compared to the national plan. The total output value of the factory's national plan this year increased by 101.45% compared to last year, and after discussion, it increased by another 15.93% compared to the national plan. The guide vane group of the processing workshop of the factory, with a total of 14 people, had an annual task of 1,010 working days. After discussion, it can be reduced to 705 days, reducing working days by 30%. The scrap rate used to be 15%. After discussion, it was reduced to 5% to 3%.
    The vast majority of factories, while discussing and formulating plans, also paid attention to conscientiously implementing the plans, so that production has been improved, and the national plans have been completed or exceeded. For example, after completing the plan and revising the group covenants and workshop guarantee contracts, Factory 53 launched a factory-wide patriotic production competition to promote the realization of the action plans of the entire factory, workshops, groups, and individuals. The factory completed the guarantee plan on time in February, the quality reached 95.11%, and the cost was reduced by 2.86%. In March, the guarantee plan was completed on a daily basis, the quality reached 95.5%, exceeding the guarantee plan by 0.5%. Advanced workers had already reached the indicators required in December in February. At the same time, because they paid attention to establishing advanced figures and promoting the advanced experience of advanced figures in a timely manner after formulating plans, the number of people who completed personal action plans according to the schedule is also increasing day by day. For example, in the fifth workshop, 71% of people completed their personal plans in February, and by March, the completion rate of personal plans reached 80%. Another example is the railway factory. The task in March was very heavy, and the possibility of not completing it was very high. However, in the discussion of the plan, after mobilizing the masses to find "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise), solve key problems in production, and make emergency measures, the difficulties were overcome, and the situation of not being able to complete the task was reversed.
    The experience of Shenyang City in mobilizing employees to discuss national plans is mainly: First, in-depth and repeated political and ideological mobilization was carried out to prepare for the discussion of the plans. The city conducted a relatively in-depth and widespread political and ideological mobilization for all employees regarding the new tasks of the new era, especially the mobilization of the three major national tasks, which laid the ideological foundation for the discussion and formulation of plans. The first category of factories that discussed the plans well were units where ideological mobilization was done more thoroughly. For example, the lead electrolysis and real furnace workshops of Shenyang Smelter, after combining their own workshop production tasks, analyzing favorable and unfavorable conditions, and conducting repeated mobilization, some workers still had concerns, lacked confidence, and had conservative ideas. Some said: "All the '窍门' (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) were found last year. This year's plan is high. It's hard to find any '窍门' (qiaomen, tricks/expertise)!" The leadership immediately conducted investigations and understandings, and according to different situations, specially assigned tasks, drove backward elements through advanced figures, inspired the masses to use self-education methods, improved political awareness, and dispelled ideological concerns, thus quickly a large number of "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) appeared, tapped potential, solved key problems, and greatly promoted production.
    Second, it is necessary to combine digging potential, finding "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise), promoting various advanced experiences, and solving major and minor key production problems in the process of discussing and formulating plans. This is a decisive link in overcoming conservative ideas, formulating advanced action plans, and ensuring the realization of national plans. During the discussion and formulation of plans, according to incomplete statistics from 37 major state-owned factories, a total of 23,187 "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) of various sizes were found in about two months, of which 14,155 "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) were found in 18 factories. About 24% of these "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) have been adopted. Most factories are finding "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) around solving key problems in production. According to statistics from 14 factories, a total of 263 key problems were solved in combination with finding "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) during the discussion and formulation of plans. A total of 333 key problems in production were found in another five factories, and 128 were solved. The discovery of these "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) and the solution of key problems have played a great role in improving the level of enterprises and productivity, and have created a lot of wealth for the country. For example, the Oil and Chemical Factory found a total of 943 "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise), of which 501 adopted "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) can create 12.9 billion yuan of wealth for the country. In addition, many factories have promoted various advanced experiences in the discussion of plans to ensure the formulation and implementation of advanced plans.
    Third, it is necessary to strengthen the specific leadership of the discussion of national plans in order to obtain better results. The specific methods are: (1) Conduct the discussion of national plans with leadership and in a step-by-step manner. The main steps are: first, do a good job of mobilization and education for the three major tasks; combine mobilization and education to do a good job of specific preparations (including summarizing the various indicators reached in 1952, analyzing favorable and unfavorable conditions according to the new tasks, proposing the key and direction of tapping potential, etc.); announce the plan or preliminary goals, and then mobilize all employees to carry out activities to find "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) and promote advanced experience in a targeted manner, in order to deeply tap potential, and on this basis, formulate specific action plans for the entire factory, workshops, groups, and individuals to ensure the over-fulfillment of the national plan (including the amount exceeded or the time advanced); sign collective contracts, revise patriotic pacts, and further carry out patriotic production competitions; and further strengthen plan management, and strive to achieve the national plan in a rhythmic, balanced manner on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. (2) Conduct key experiments, summarize experience, and promote comprehensiveness. The city selected four factory units to conduct key experiments, and summarized the experience of three points, introduced them to factories throughout the city, and played a great role in promoting them. Each factory (mainly the first and second categories) also selected workshops, departments, or groups to conduct key experiments, learn and apply the method of Factory 53 to conduct key experiments, conduct ideological surveys, and strengthen ideological leadership, and use the experience of key experiments to educate and train cadres and promote production throughout the factory. (3) Organize department technical personnel and staff to go deep into the workshops and combine with workers to help workers solve problems in a timely manner. Many units' department technical personnel and staff have improved their awareness after the education of the three major tasks, and went deep into the workshops to help workers dig potential and calculate detailed accounts, formulate group plans and personal plans, and realize "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) in a timely manner. For example, the technical personnel and staff of Machine Factory 1 formed seven groups, under the guidance of engineers, in a planned, organized, and purposeful manner, went deep into the workshops, not only solved problems, but also strengthened the connection between technical personnel and staff and workers. (4) Conduct in-depth inspections in a timely manner to overcome shortcomings. In the discussion of the plan, the city organized inspection teams to inspect the units with serious conservative ideas and difficulties in completing tasks, and as a result, improved the situation of these units. Some units that have completed the plan have also conducted timely reviews and random checks to correct the formalistic problems of some group plans.
    In addition, some factories, due to insufficient understanding of the significance and purpose of the discussion of plans, still have some more serious problems in the discussion of plans: First, about 27% of the units discussed the plans hastily and did not conscientiously mobilize the masses to tap potential, resulting in very few or even no "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise). Some conservative ideas have not been overcome, and they are unwilling to formulate advanced plans. Some mistakenly believe that the national plan is low and can be completed without effort, so there is no need to discuss it seriously. Second, many group plans lack specific guarantee measures. For example, the smelter is a unit with a better discussion plan, but in the review, it was also found that 30% of the group plans were not specific. Third, many units do not deal with "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) rationalization proposals in a timely manner, and the accumulated quantity is large. Some have regulations that a special person is responsible, but they have not assumed responsibility; some rationalization proposals are adopted but not rewarded in a timely manner. This hinders the further development of the movement to find "窍门" (qiaomen, tricks/expertise) and promote advanced experience. Fourth, some did not improve product quality in the discussion of the plan, the scrap rate was high, and attention to production safety was poor, and even serious mechanical equipment accidents occurred, affecting the completion of production tasks. Fifth, what is particularly worth pointing out is that some units did not pay attention to establishing and improving plan management, and ignored the formulation of specific operation plans and the organization of rhythmic and balanced production. These shortcomings need to be overcome continuously.

    沈阳市一百多个国营和地方国营工厂
    讨论国家计划获得初步经验
    【本报讯】沈阳市一百多个国营工厂与地方国营工厂，从一月下旬起，相继展开了讨论国家计划与制订具体行动计划的工作，到三月底，大部国营工厂初步告一段落，取得了不少的成绩和经验。
    各国营工厂讨论计划的情形，大体可以分为三类：第一类，充分发动了群众，计划讨论得比较细致，发掘窍门多，解决问题也多，收获比较大。这一类的工厂约占百分之三十。第二类，讨论计划比较认真，收获也比较多，但还有很多缺点。它们讨论计划晚了一些，因而结束得也比较晚。这一类的工厂约占百分之四十三。第三类，讨论计划草率、拖拉，走了弯路，发动群众很不够，进展很慢，收获很少，保守思想较严重。这一类的工厂约占百分之二十七。另外，还有少数单位，因为计划制订得晚，或者赶着完成临时急迫的任务，还没有正式讨论国家计划。
    第一类和第二类的一部分单位，不但制订了比较先进的行动计划，而且制订了保证实现计划的具体措施计划，并修订了或正在修订小组爱国公约，其中有的已在签订集体合同，大部分正在进行集体签订合同的准备工作。
    第一类与第二类国营工厂发动职工讨论国家计划的收获，主要表现在：全体职工的政治思想觉悟有了更进一步的提高，他们决心更加积极地来迎接新时期的新任务，因而克服了保守思想，大大发掘了企业的潜在力，制订出了比较先进的具体行动计划。全厂、车间、小组以及个人都有了明确的具体奋斗目标（一般的包括产量、质量、成本、财务、技术等几个方面）。如五三工厂经过讨论制订的具体行动计划比国家计划产量提高百分之十五，质量提高百分之○·六二四一，成本降低百分之四。机器六厂的国家计划规定的水泵任务已比去年提高了百分之六十八·二二，经过讨论又比国家计划提高了百分之二十八·五二。该厂今年国家计划的生产总值比去年提高了百分之一百零一·四五，经过讨论又比国家计划提高了百分之十五·九三。该厂加工车间导翼组全组十四人，全年任务工作日为一千零一十天，经过讨论可降至七百零五天，减少工作日百分之三十，废品率过去是百分之十五，经过讨论降低至百分之五到百分之三。
    绝大多数工厂在讨论与制订计划中，同时就注意认真贯彻执行计划，使生产有了提高，完成或超额完成了国家计划。如五三工厂在订完计划和修订完小组公约与车间保证合同后，深入展开了全厂性的爱国生产竞赛，以推动全厂、车间、小组及个人行动计划的实现。该厂二月份按时完成了保证计划，质量达到百分之九十五·一一，成本降低百分之二·八六。三月份按日完成着保证计划，质量达到百分之九十五·五，超过保证计划的百分之○·五。先进工人在二月份已达到了十二月份要求的指标。同时由于他们在制订计划之后，及时注意树立先进人物与推广先进人物的先进经验，按进度完成个人行动计划的也在日益增多，如第五车间二月份完成个人计划的占百分之七十一，到三月份完成个人计划的即达到了百分之八十。又如铁路工厂三月份的任务非常繁重，完不成的可能性很大，但在讨论计划中，经过发动群众找窍门，解决生产中的关键问题，作出紧急措施，结果克服了困难，扭转了完不成任务的情况。
    沈阳市发动职工讨论国家计划的经验主要是：第一、深入反复地进行了政治思想动员，做好讨论计划的准备工作。该市比较深入普遍地向全体职工进行了新时期新任务的政治思想动员，特别是国家三大任务的动员，给讨论与制订计划打下了思想基础。讨论计划好的第一类工厂都是思想动员工作做得比较深透的单位。如沈阳冶炼厂的铅电解、真吹炉两个车间，在结合着本车间生产任务，分析有利的和不利的条件，进行了反复动员后，还有一部分工人有顾虑，没信心，有保守思想，有的说：“窍门去年都找绝了，今年计划高，找啥窍门都够呛！”领导方面当即进行调查了解，根据不同情况，又专门分工，通过先进人物带动落后分子，启发群众运用自我教育方式，提高政治觉悟，解除了思想顾虑，从而就很快出现了大量窍门，发掘了潜力，解决了关键问题，大大推进了生产。
    第二、必须在讨论与制订计划过程中，结合进行挖潜力，找窍门，推广各种先进经验，解决大小生产关键问题。这是克服保守思想，制订先进行动计划，和保证实现国家计划的决定环节。在讨论与制订计划中，据三十七个主要国营工厂的不完全统计，在两个月左右的时间内，共找出各种大小窍门二万三千一百八十七件，其中十八个工厂共找到窍门一万四千一百五十五件。这些窍门已经采用的有百分之二十四左右。大部分工厂的找窍门是围绕着解决生产中的关键问题进行的。据十四个工厂的统计，在讨论与制订计划中，结合进行找窍门，共解决了关键问题二百六十三件。在另外五个工厂中共找到生产中的关键问题三百三十三件，解决了一百二十八件。这些窍门的发现与关键问题的解决，对企业的水平及生产力的提高起了很大作用，给国家创造了大量财富。如油脂化学厂共找到了窍门九百四十三件，其中被采纳的五百零一件窍门，即可为国家创造财富一百二十九亿元。此外，很多工厂都在讨论计划中推广了各种先进经验，保证了先进计划的制订与实现。
    第三、必须加强对讨论国家计划的具体领导，才能获得更好的成绩。具体作法是：（一）有领导、有步骤地进行讨论国家计划。步骤主要是：先做好三大任务的动员教育；结合动员教育做好具体准备工作（包括总结一九五二年已达到的各种指标，根据新任务分析有利及不利条件，提出挖掘潜力的关键及方向等）；公布计划或初步奋斗目标，然后有目标地发动全体职工开展找窍门、推广先进经验运动，以便深入挖掘潜力，并在这个基础上，订出全厂、车间、小组、个人的保证超额完成国家计划的具体行动计划（包括超过的数额或提前的时间）；签订集体合同，修订爱国公约，进一步开展爱国生产竞赛；并进一步加强计划管理，为按日、按旬、按月均衡地实现国家计划而斗争。（二）进行重点试验，总结经验，推动全面。该市选择了四个工厂单位进行了重点试验，并且总结了三个点的经验，介绍给全市各厂，起了很大推动作用。各厂（主要是第一类、第二类）也都选择了车间、科室或小组进行了重点试验，学习与运用了五三工厂采取重点试验，进行思想调查，加强思想领导的方法，并用重点试验的经验来教育和训练干部，推动全厂生产。（三）组织科室技术人员和职员深入车间与工人结合，帮助工人及时解决问题。很多单位的科室技术人员和职员，经过三大任务教育后觉悟提高了，深入车间帮助工人挖潜力算细账，制订小组计划与个人计划，及时实现窍门。如机械一厂的技术人员和职员组成七个组，在工程师的指导下，有计划、有组织、有目的地深入车间，不但解决了问题，而且加强了技术人员和职员与工人的联系。（四）及时进行深入检查，克服缺点。在讨论计划中，该市组织了检查组，检查了保守思想严重及完成任务困难的单位，结果改善了这些单位的情况。有些订完计划的单位，也及时进行了复查、抽查，纠正了某些小组计划的形式主义毛病。
    另外，有些工厂在讨论计划中，由于对讨论计划的意义及目的认识不足，还存在着一些比较严重的问题：第一、有百分之二十七左右的单位讨论计划草率，未认真发动群众挖掘潜力，以致发掘窍门很少，甚至没有。有的保守思想未克服，不愿制订先进计划。有的错误地认为国家计划规定得低，不用使劲就可完成，用不着再认真讨论了。第二、不少小组计划缺少具体保证办法。如冶炼厂是讨论计划比较好的单位，但在复查中还发现有百分之三十的小组计划不具体。第三、不少单位对窍门合理化建议处理不及时，积压的数量很多。有的规定有专人负责，但也未负起责任来；有的合理化建议采用了也不及时予以奖励。这就阻碍了找窍门推广先进经验运动的进一步开展。第四、有的在讨论计划中没有改进产品质量，废品率高，注意生产安全差，甚至发生了严重的机械设备事故，影响了生产任务的完成。第五、特别值得指出的是有些单位没有注意建立与健全计划管理，忽视制订具体作业计划，组织有节奏地均衡生产。这些缺点都需继续克服。
