Serious Waste of Construction Materials in Northeast Coal Mines

The supply of basic construction materials in various coal mine bureaus in Northeast China has a serious problem of overestimation and underutilization, and discrepancies between planned amounts and actual needs. This has resulted in a large accumulation of idle materials, affecting the turnover of funds. For example, in the No. 74 and No. 75 projects of the Beipiao Mining Bureau, the original plan called for 541 rolls of asphalt felt, but only 90 rolls were actually used; the original plan called for 2,100 roof tiles, but only 90 were actually used; the original plan called for 2 tons of round iron, but only 0.24 tons were actually used. For the construction project of the Fuxin Mining Bureau's General Machinery Plant, the original plan called for 60 tons of clay, but only 20 tons were actually used. The Tonghua Mining Bureau ordered 113 tons of steel-cored aluminum stranded wire from the former Northeast Electrical Industry Administration Bureau this year, with 55 tons scheduled for delivery in the first quarter and the remainder in the second quarter; 26 tons have already been delivered, and 29 tons are being manufactured; however, the Tonghua Mining Bureau now claims that the original plan was incorrect and requested a return of the goods, resulting in a loss of 2.5 billion yuan. The shaft project of the Xi'an Mining Bureau planned to use 420 meters of steel wire rope, but because the steel wire rope did not meet the specifications, it could not be used and was all stockpiled.

The reasons for the above situation are that some planning and design personnel lack a strong sense of responsibility and economic accounting, and they make plans based only on subjective wishes without considering actual needs; material staff are not familiar with the construction process, nor do they conduct investigations and research, they are ignorant of the true situation and blindly overestimate needs, holding the view that "it is better to have stockpiles than to have shortages"; and the leadership has a bureaucratic work style, not understanding the situation at lower levels, or adopting a conciliatory attitude after the above situations are exposed, attributing everything to "lack of experience."

    东北各煤矿建筑材料浪费严重
    东北各煤矿局基本建设材料的供应工作，都有严重的宽打窄用及计划与实际需要不符现象，致使大批材料呆滞起来，影响了资金周转。如北票矿务局的七十四号和七十五号工程，原计划用油毡五百四十一卷，实用九十卷；原计划用背瓦两千一百块，实用九十块；原计划用元铁二吨，实用零点二四吨。阜新矿务局总机厂建筑工程，原计划用粘土六十吨，实用二十吨。通化矿务局今年向原东北电器工业管理局订购的一百十三吨钢心铝捻线，定于第一季度交货五十五吨，其余于第二季度交货；现在已交货二十六吨，正在制造中有二十九吨；但通化矿务局又声称原计划不正确，要求退货，造成了二十五亿元的损失。西安矿务局竖井工程计划用四百二十公尺钢丝绳，因钢丝绳不合规格不能用，全部积压下来。
    发生上述情况的原因是某些计划人员与设计人员工作责任心不强，缺乏经济核算思想，只凭主观愿望做计划而不顾实际需要；材料工作人员不熟悉修建过程，也不调查研究，心中无数，盲目地宽打窄用，有“积压比供不上好”的思想；领导上存在官僚主义作风，不了解下情，或在上述情况揭发出来后，采取迁就态度，都归到“没有经验”上去。
