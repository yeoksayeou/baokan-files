Diplomatic officials from the Embassy of the Czechoslovak Republic in China also attended the ceremony.

The ceremony was held in the square behind the village. Sixteen brand-new machines, including tractors, water pumps, and horse-drawn plows, were neatly arranged by the side of the stage.

The ceremony was presided over by Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, spoke first. He pointed out that the new machines and farm implements sent by the "Unified Agricultural Cooperative" of Vinarsice Village, Czechoslovakia, will not only help the farmers of Zhangguozhuang to increase production, but more importantly, they bring the profound friendship of the Czechoslovak people to the Chinese people.

Amidst warm applause, Ambassador Konsala spoke. He first excitedly told everyone that on April 26th, the farmers of Vinarsice Village will hold a grand "Friendship Day between Vinarsice Village and Zhangguozhuang Village." After introducing the situation of Vinarsice Village, Ambassador Konsala said that the establishment of this friendship will further promote the friendly relations between the people of China and Czechoslovakia.

Then, Wang Liang, the village head of Zhangguozhuang Village, and Guo Rong, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, spoke successively, unanimously expressing that they would use the actual action of a bumper harvest in the whole village to thank the Czechoslovak farmer brothers for their gift. Wang Liang also entrusted Ambassador Konsala to forward a letter of thanks from the farmers of the village to the "Unified Agricultural Cooperative" of Vinarsice Village.

After the ceremony, the farmers of Zhangguozhuang warmly invited Ambassador Konsala and all the guests attending the ceremony to eat dumplings.

The friendship between the farmers of Zhangguozhuang and the people of Czechoslovakia began in the winter of 1950. That year, they had just completed land reform, and the Embassy of the Czechoslovak Republic sent people to celebrate their victory. Before leaving, the farmers also wrote a letter to President Gottwald, reporting on their living conditions. Since then, when delegations from the Czechoslovak Republic came to China to visit, they would come to Zhangguozhuang to visit them; the farmers also warmly received the visitors as if they were relatives.

    洛德捷维纳尔日采村
    赠我张郭庄农业机器
    【新华社二十四日讯】捷克斯洛伐克共和国布拉格州维纳尔日采村“统一农业合作社”送给我国北京市丰台区张郭庄村农民们一批农业生产机器。二十四日上午，隆重的授礼仪式在张郭庄举行，由捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻我国大使康萨拉授礼。
    参加仪式的有中央人民政府农业部部长李书城、副部长杨显东，中央人民政府外交部苏联东欧司副司长温宁，北京市人民政府副市长吴晗、农林局局长周凤鸣、外事处处长马振武；以及张郭庄村全体农民和附近各村农民代表共约九百多人。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻我国大使馆外交官员也参加了仪式。
    仪式在村后广场上举行。拖拉机、抽水机、马拉步犁等十六件崭新的机器，整齐的排在主席台边。
    仪式由北京市人民政府吴晗副市长主持。中央人民政府农业部李书城部长首先讲话。他指出：捷克斯洛伐克维纳尔日采村的“统一农业合作社”送来的新式的机器和农具，不但能帮助张郭庄农民提高生产，而更重要的是带来了捷克斯洛伐克人民对我国人民的深厚友谊。
    在热烈的掌声中，康萨拉大使讲话。他首先兴奋的告诉大家，在四月二十六日维纳尔日采村的农民将举行隆重的“维纳尔日采村和张郭庄村友谊建立日”。在介绍了维纳尔日采村的情况后，康萨拉大使说：这种友谊的建立，将更加促进中捷两国人民的友好关系。
    康萨拉大使讲话后，张郭庄的少年儿童队员向他献花致敬。接着张郭庄村村长王亮和农业生产合作社主任郭荣先后讲话，他们一致表示要以全村丰收的实际行动，来答谢捷克斯洛伐克农民兄弟的赠礼。王亮并将该村农民致维纳尔日采村“统一农业合作社”谢函一件面托康萨拉大使转交。
    仪式结束后，张郭庄农民热情地请康萨拉大使和所有参加仪式的来宾吃了一顿饺子。
    张郭庄农民和捷克斯洛伐克人民的友谊是自一九五○年冬天开始的。那年他们刚完成了土地改革，捷克斯洛伐克共和国大使馆曾派人来庆祝他们的胜利，临走时，农民们还给哥特瓦尔德总统写了一封信，报告他们的生活情况。此后，捷克斯洛伐克共和国的代表团来中国访问时，都要到张郭庄来访问他们；农民们也像款待亲人似的热情地招待访问者。
