    Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 17th (TASS): President Eisenhower delivered a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on the issue of the international situation. President Eisenhower pointed out that the question of "how to provide the people of the world with the opportunity for a just peace" is now the top priority. He then devoted a significant portion of his speech to finding grounds for and defending the American government's post-war foreign policy, including justifying military expansion, the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, etc. The blame for the current international situation is placed on the policies of the Soviet Union, but without any factual evidence to support it. President Eisenhower continued, saying that "the moment has arrived for all governments in the world to state their intentions with simple honesty." In his speech, President Eisenhower outlined his own program for resolving all international problems to the leaders of the Soviet Union, saying, "As long as there is a willingness to respect the rights of all other nations, no problem, large or small, is unsolvable," and that "America is willing to do its fair share." However, even in this part of the speech, there was absolutely no mention of China or the restoration of its national rights, nor was there any mention of issues such as restoring the unification of Germany based on the Potsdam Agreement. According to President Eisenhower, with the "strengthening of universal trust," it would be possible to "undertake the next great task – reducing the burden of armaments that now weighs upon the world. To this end, we shall welcome and conclude the most solemn agreements. These agreements should include the following:
    (1) Limiting the number of troops and security forces in all countries of the world, either by absolute numbers or by an agreed international ratio;
    (2) All countries of the world should agree to stipulate an agreed limit to limit the proportion of the total output of certain strategic materials supplied for military purposes;
    (3) Implementing international control of atomic energy, promoting its use only for peaceful purposes, and ensuring the prohibition of atomic weapons;
    (4) Limiting or prohibiting other types of weapons of mass destruction;
    (5) Implementing appropriate safeguards, including a practical system of inspection by the United Nations, to ensure the implementation of all these agreed limitations and prohibitions." On such a major issue as disarmament, the President made only these very vague remarks: "The details of such a disarmament program are obviously of great significance and are complex in nature."

    艾森豪威尔发表演说为美国战争政策辩解
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：艾森豪威尔总统在美国报纸编辑协会发表关于国际形势问题的演说。艾森豪威尔总统指出，“如何使世界人民获得公正和平的机会”这一问题现在被提到第一位了，他于是在他的演说中以相当大的一部分为美国政府战后外交政策找根据和辩解，其中也为扩军、建立北大西洋集团等等辩解。造成目前国际局势的罪过给加在苏联政策的头上了，然而并没有事实来作证明。艾森豪威尔总统继续说，“要求世界各国政府以简单诚实的态度说出它们意图的时刻”到来了。艾森豪威尔总统在他的演说中向苏联的领导者拟定了自己的解决一切国际问题的纲领，他说：“只要有尊重其他一切国家权利的意愿，这些争论的问题不问大小，没有一个是不可以解决的”，“美国愿意尽它的应尽的本分”。然而就在演说中的这一部分也完全没有谈到关于中国及恢复其国家权利的问题，同时也没有谈到像根据波茨坦协定恢复德国统一这样的问题。照艾森豪威尔总统的话说，随着“普遍信任的加强”，就可以“进行下一个伟大的工作——裁减现在压在世界头上的军备负担。为了这个目的，我们将欢迎并缔结最庄严的协定。这些协定应当包括下列各项：
    （一）按照绝对的数目或按照一种协议一致的国际比例，限制世界各国军队与保安部队的人数；
        （二）世界各国约定须要规定一个协议一致的限制，以限定某些供给军事用途的战略物资总产量的比例；
    （三）实行原子能国际管制，促进它只用于和平的用途，并保证禁止原子武器；
    （四）限制或禁止其他种类大规模破坏的武器；
    （五）实行适当的保障办法，包括切实可行的由联合国检查的制度在内，以保证所有这些协议一致的限制和禁止的实施。”在裁减军备这样重大的问题上，总统只作了这样十分空泛的谈论：“这种裁军计划的细节显然是有着极重大的意义，而且是性质复杂的。”
