Regarding the Instructions for Voter Certificates

    I. A single format is stipulated for voter certificates, with both vertical and horizontal writing styles. Only one side is printed; the back is not printed.
    II. General election areas or electoral units adopt the vertical writing format. Minority ethnic areas may choose either format suitable for their written language and writing habits.
    Voter certificates in minority ethnic areas should have the name of the voter certificate and the headings of each column translated into their respective ethnic languages and added above the Chinese text, i.e., in the position indicated by the parentheses in the second format of the voter certificate.
    III. The type of paper for voter certificates is not uniformly specified. Whatever paper is convenient locally should be used.
    IV. Voter certificates are generally printed by the election committee at the level above the basic-level electoral unit and issued by the basic-level election committee. For example, voter certificates used in townships and towns are printed by the county election committee and issued by the township and town election committees; voter certificates used in urban districts under the jurisdiction of a city are printed by the city election committee and issued by the district election committees. Voter certificates used in cities not divided into districts may be printed by their corresponding level election committee.
    V. The size of the voter certificate paper is generally specified as: 11 x 8 centimeters.
