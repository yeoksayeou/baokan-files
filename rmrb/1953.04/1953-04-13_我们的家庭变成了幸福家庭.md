    Our Family Became a Happy Family
    Zheng Xianghui
    My name is Zheng Xianghui, and I am a farmer from Xinli Village, Qinjiagang Township, Third District, Chongqing City. In 1945, my parents arranged for me to marry Li Wenlan. After the marriage, we were not harmonious. Also, because we borrowed money to pay for the "wedding feast," creditors often came to demand payment. I felt angry and considered Li Wenlan a source of misfortune, so I treated her even worse. Day after day, I saw neighbors beating their wives, and I learned to do the same, often beating Li Wenlan. In the old society, I had deeply ingrained patriarchal "husband power" ideas, believing that "women can only boil tea and cook rice, they can't do anything," and that "a man, as the head of the family, should keep his woman under control." I would often find some "fault" to beat and scold Li Wenlan; even when I made mistakes myself, such as poor production, I would vent my anger on Li Wenlan. I never let her use the money I made from selling vegetables. For over seven years of marriage, I didn't even give her money for thread, hiding my wallet away. I also often spoke ill of her to my mother, who believed me and also said Wenlan was wrong. Wenlan suffered grievances and had nowhere to turn, only hiding to cry, losing interest in production, housework, and the children.

    After liberation, I became the chairman of the village farmers' association. Although I stopped beating and scolding Li Wenlan, I still looked down on her, always showing a "black face coming in and a black face going out," threatening her at every turn with "We have no feelings, let's get a divorce!"

    Both Wenlan and I had feudal ideas. My work was busy, and sometimes I came home late at night. She wouldn't open the door, suspecting me of having affairs with other women. She said, "Male and female cadres work together, dancing and singing, I don't know what kind of shenanigans they're up to!" Sometimes when I saw Wenlan singing and dancing, I would blush with shame and feel unhappy. We argued all day long, and production suffered.

    In 1950, I studied the Marriage Law in a rural cadre training class and gained a preliminary understanding of the feudal marriage system and feudal ideas. However, at the time, I still had some incorrect ideas, believing that the Marriage Law only benefited women. In 1951, after hearing several reports on the Marriage Law, I realized that I had feudal, patriarchal ideas. I thought: I am a cadre, I must take the lead in eliminating bad ideas; especially after listening to the report by Comrade Gan Lu of the Third District Women's Federation, I realized that the Marriage Law not only benefited women but also men. Comrade Gan Lu cited many examples of undemocratic and disharmonious families that had become democratic and harmonious new families after understanding the Marriage Law. I thought: My family is an undemocratic and disharmonious family. To improve production, I must first make the family democratic and harmonious. After several days of ideological struggle, I took the initiative to apologize to Wenlan. She also boldly raised her opinions to me, saying that I once hit her with a carrying pole, and another time scolded her until she cried... As a result, both of us realized the wrongs of the past, the wrongs of the feudal marriage system, and the unacceptability of patriarchal ideas. Soon, I held a family meeting with Wenlan and my old mother. Everyone openly discussed and agreed on a division of labor in the family, implementing economic democracy. Wenlan took the initiative to take on heavy tasks such as cooking, selling vegetables, carrying coal, carrying water, and cutting grass; my mother did lighter work such as cooking pig feed and taking care of the children; I was mainly responsible for production and farmers' association work. Issues such as making new clothes, buying things, and production were discussed during meals. In the past, even buying half a pound of oil or half a pound of salt required me to go personally, and I controlled all the family's finances. Now, Wenlan and my mother manage them, and the money is used very purposefully. I can concentrate on my work, unlike before when I was distracted.

    Now our life is very good, with smiles coming in and smiles going out. We raise opinions to each other. Once, Wenlan noticed that I was only focused on work and neglecting production, so she pointed out to me: "We must work hard, but we must not relax production." This corrected me in time. With my help, Wenlan worked hard to study and was elected as a model student.

    Last spring, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, farmers in Qinjiagang Township formed many production mutual aid teams, but few women participated. I first mobilized Wenlan to join the mutual aid team, saying to her: "Now that we are liberated, women should participate in labor." Last year during rice planting, I asked Wenlan to go to the fields to plant rice. She said: "People say: when women go to the fields, the fields will leak, the rice will not grow, it will not produce grain. I'm afraid people will scold me if I go to the fields." I said that was feudal superstition, the idea of men despising women in the past, and I told her how to pull seedlings, how to bundle them, and how to plant them. With my help, Wenlan's rice planting gradually went from sparse and uneven, and the rows not straight, to being as neat as the sole of a shoe. Because Wenlan went to the fields to plant rice, she motivated three women on the first day, and seven women on the second day. Later, Wenlan and other women learned to plant rice. From this, I realized that women indeed have the same abilities as men. Since then, our relationship has become even better. We help each other in production, ideology, and life, and encourage each other to strive to be models in production.

    Last autumn, during the harvest, Wenlan used her nap time to select seeds under the sun. She said: "When I think of selecting good 'Zhongnong No. 43' to welcome large-scale production, I get more energy." She selected more than one dou of seeds over four noons, without delaying the harvesting work. When the district assessed models, she was named a seed selection model. Because I was active in production and work, the yield of rice fields increased to more than 780 jin per mu, and I was selected as a paddy field model, a model propaganda worker for the Chongqing Party, and a model worker for Chongqing City. Our mutual aid team's production last year increased by 38.2 percent compared to the previous year.

    Wenlan became pregnant, and it was inconvenient for her to carry water, so she asked me to go to the street to buy some medicine to abort the child to make it easier to do things. I said: "It is glorious for women to give birth, you can't have an abortion. The Marriage Law protects the interests of children. You can't do heavy work now, I should help you." I took on the heavy tasks of carrying water, carrying coal, and selling vegetables, and let her rest more. But Wenlan was afraid that I would have too much to do, which would affect production and work, so she secretly carried water when I went to meetings. I discovered it, so I got up early every day to fill the water tank, hide the buckets, and fill the water tank again when I got home at night. I couldn't let her carry water with her big belly.

    Wenlan is also very considerate of me. Every night, she sits at the door waiting for me to come home. As soon as I enter the house, she brings a large basin of hot water for me to wash my feet, and even finds my shoes.

    Li Wenlan and my mother also have a good relationship. In the past, my mother didn't like her and deliberately said she slept late in the morning. Now, she especially tells her to sleep a little longer to avoid getting tired while pregnant. When Wenlan goes to study at night, my mother takes good care of the two grandchildren. Before Wenlan gave birth this time, my mother raised a lot of chickens, preparing to eat them after she gave birth. Wenlan is also very concerned about my mother, cooking an egg for her to eat every morning, saying that she is old and her body is not well, so she needs to be nourished. In the past, Wenlan couldn't wait for her mother-in-law to die, now she hopes her mother-in-law will live a few more years.

    Our relationship as husband and wife is good, the family is harmonious, the family income has increased, and life is getting better and better. In 1952, our whole family (six people, three children) added six sets of new cotton clothes, eight sets of new unlined clothes, and six new underwear items. We raised four pigs. We even slaughtered a New Year's pig this year during the Spring Festival. Many people envy our happy family and say they want to learn from us. On the day of the Spring Festival, Wenlan and I took the children to the Chongqing Labor People's Cultural Palace to play. There were many slogans posted on the walls of the Cultural Palace, and I taught Li Wenlan to recognize two-thirds of the words on them. Li Wenlan said to me: "Chairman Mao has come, we are liberated, and the People's Government has built such a beautiful Cultural Palace especially for us working people, how happy we are! We must respond to Chairman Mao's call and strive for a bumper harvest in 1953. Next year for the New Year, we will take the children by train to Chengdu to play!"

    I thank the Communist Party, thank Chairman Mao! With the Marriage Law, our relationship as husband and wife is harmonious and united, the benefits of the Marriage Law are endless. This time, Chongqing City implemented the propaganda of the Marriage Law, using Qinjiagang as a key experiment, and Wenlan and I were praised as model couples. We must always maintain this glorious title, work even harder in production and work, and often publicize the Marriage Law to the masses so that everyone can live a happy family life.

### 我们的家庭变成了幸福家庭

    我们的家庭变成了幸福家庭
    郑相辉
    我叫郑相辉，是重庆市第三区覃家岗乡新立村的一个农民。一九四五年，由父母包办我和李文兰结了婚。结婚以后我们就不和睦。又因为结婚时请
    “喜酒”借了些钱，债主常来要账，我心里很气，认为李文兰是个祸根，更加对她不好。一天到晚又看到邻居打老婆，我也就学会了，常打李文兰。在旧社会里，我习染了很重的男尊女卑的“夫权思想”，觉得“妇女只会烧茶煮饭，干不了事”，“男子汉，当家人，就该把女的管住点”，经常找点“过错”，打骂李文兰；甚至自己作错了事，譬如生产搞不好，心里不高兴时，都找李文兰出气。我卖小菜的钱，从不给她用。结婚七年多，连针线钱都没给她一个，把钱包藏了又藏。我还时常在母亲面前说她坏话，母亲信我的话，也说文兰不对。文兰受了委屈，有苦无处说，只躲在一边哭，对生产、家务、小孩都无心照顾。
    解放后，我当了村农民协会主席，虽然不再打骂李文兰了，但还是瞧她不起，经常是“黑脸进，黑脸出”，动不动就向她提出：“我们感情不好，离婚！”
    我和文兰都有封建思想。我的工作忙，有时深夜回家，她不给开门，还怀疑我在外边乱搞男女关系。她说：“男女干部在一起工作，又跳舞、又唱歌，不知道搞些什么名堂！”有时我看到文兰唱歌、跳舞，也羞得脸绯红，心里不高兴。我们整天吵吵闹闹，生产搞不好。
    一九五○年，我在农村干部训练班学习了婚姻法，对封建婚姻制度、封建思想有了初步认识，但当时还有些错误想法，认为婚姻法只是对妇女有好处。一九五一年，又听了几次有关婚姻法的报告，才检查出自己有男尊女卑的封建思想。我想：自己是干部，一定要带头清除坏思想才对；尤其是听了第三区妇联甘露同志的报告，才认识到婚姻法不单对妇女有好处，对男人也有好处。甘露同志在报告中举了许多不民主不和睦的家庭因为懂得了婚姻法变为民主和睦的新家庭的实例。我想：自己的家庭是一个不民主不和睦的家庭，要搞好生产，就要先把家庭变得民主和睦起来。经过几天的思想斗争以后，我主动地向文兰作了检讨，她也大胆地向我提出意见，说我有一次用扁担打她，有一次又骂得她哭了……。这一来，两人都认识到以前的不好，都是封建婚姻制度的不好，男尊女卑的思想要不得。不久，我便和文兰、老母亲一起开家庭会，大家自报公议作了家庭分工，实行经济民主。文兰抢先把煮饭、卖菜、挑煤、挑水、割草等重活担起；母亲作煮猪草、带小孩等轻活；我主要是搞生产、搞农会工作。作新衣、买东西和生产等问题，都在吃饭的时候讨论。过去称半斤油、半斤盐都要我亲自去，家里的经济大权由我一手包揽，现在由文兰和母亲管理，钱用得很有计划。我工作起来也安心了，不像以前那样一心两挂。
    现在我们的生活过得很好，天天笑脸进，笑脸出，有意见互相提出来。有一回，文兰发现我只搞工作，忽视了生产，就向我提出：“工作要努力搞，但生产也不要放松。”及时纠正了我。文兰在我帮助下，努力学习，当选了学习模范。
    去年春天，覃家岗乡农民在党和人民政府的领导下，组成了很多生产互助组，但是妇女参加的不多。我首先动员文兰参加互助组，向她说：“解放了，妇女要参加劳动才对。”去年栽秧时，我叫文兰下田栽秧。她说：“人家都说：女人下田田要漏，栽不活，不结穗，我要下田怕别人骂。”我说，那是封建迷信思想，是过去男人轻视妇女的思想，并告诉她怎样扯秧，怎样捆秧，怎样栽心。文兰在我帮助下，插秧从稀密不匀，行路不直，慢慢作到像鞋底一样整齐。因为文兰下田栽秧，第一天带动了三个妇女，第二天又带动了七个妇女，后来文兰和其他妇女都学会了栽秧。从这里，我体会到妇女确实和男子有同样的能力。从此我们夫妻感情也更好了，互相从生产、思想、生活各方面帮助，还互相鼓励要在生产上争取模范。
    去年秋收打谷时，文兰抽出午睡时间，在太阳底下选种。她说：“想起选好‘中农四十三号’迎接大生产时，劲头就大了。”四个中午选一老斗多，打谷工作也没耽误。区上评选模范时，她被评为选种模范。我也由于积极生产、积极工作，稻田每亩产量增加到七百八十多斤，被选为水稻田模范和重庆市党的模范宣传员以及重庆市的模范工作者。我们的互助组去年比前年增产百分之三十八点二。
    文兰怀了孕，挑水不方便，她就向我提出，叫我到街上去买点药把孩子打下来，做事情好方便些。我说：“妇女生孩子是光荣的事，不能打胎。婚姻法保护子女利益，你现在做不得重活，我应该帮助你。”我就把挑水、挑煤、卖菜等重活担起来，让她多休息。但是文兰怕我事情做多了，要影响生产和工作，等我开会去了，悄悄地挑水。我发觉了，就每天早点起来把水缸挑满，把水桶藏起来，晚上回家后再把水缸挑满。我不能让她挺着大肚子去挑水。
    文兰也非常体贴我。每天晚上，她坐在门口等我回家。我一进屋，她就端一大盆热水让我洗脚，连鞋子都给找来。
    李文兰和母亲的关系也好了。以前母亲不喜欢她，故意说她早上睡懒觉，现在还特别叫她多睡一下，免得怀着孩子累坏了。晚上文兰去学习，母亲把两个孙子带得好好的。这次文兰生产以前，母亲养了很多鸡，准备她生产后吃。文兰也很关心母亲，天天早上煮一个鸡蛋给母亲吃，说她老人家身体不好，要补养一下。以前文兰恨不得婆婆早死，现在希望婆婆多活几年。
    我们夫妻和好了，家庭和睦了，家庭收入也增加了，生活越过越好。一九五二年，我们全家（六口人，三个小孩）添置了新棉衣六套，新单衣八套，新内衣六件，喂了四只猪。今年春节时还杀了个过年猪。很多群众都羡慕我们的幸福家庭，表示要向我们学习。过春节那天，我和文兰带着孩子到重庆市劳动人民文化宫去玩了一趟。文化宫墙上贴着很多标语，我教会李文兰认了上面的三分之二的字。李文兰对我说：“毛主席来了，解放了，人民政府专为我们劳动人民修起这样漂亮的文化宫，多幸福呀！我们要响应毛主席的号召，一九五三年要争取丰收。明年过新年我们带着孩子坐火车到成都去玩！”
    我感谢共产党、感谢毛主席！有了婚姻法，我们夫妻和睦团结了，婚姻法的好处真是说不完。这次重庆市贯彻宣传婚姻法，在覃家岗作重点试验，我和文兰被表扬为模范夫妻。我们一定永远保持这个光荣称号，更加努力生产和工作，并经常向群众宣传婚姻法，使人人都能过幸福的家庭生活。
