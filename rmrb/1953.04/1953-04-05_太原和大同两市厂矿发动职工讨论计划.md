Taiyuan City's state-owned factories and mines and some locally-owned state factories and mines are mobilizing the masses to formulate this year's production and financial plans. In mid-February, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of leading cadres from the Party, administration, trade unions, and Communist Youth League in Taiyuan City's factories and mines, pointing out that in formulating plans, they should learn from the experience of Factory 53, strengthen political and ideological leadership, and mobilize workers to tap potential, so that the plan is based on advanced technical measures. After the meeting, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Taiyuan First District Committee, and the Taiyuan Second District Committee dispatched a total of twenty working groups to key factories and mines to assist in the work. Currently, the plan formulation work has begun in units such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Railway Factory, and Dongshan Coal Mine.

The current problems are: Some leading cadres in some units have conservative ideas; some units have chaotic steps, and are unclear about key issues; some units are only deducting numbers, and have not mobilized the masses to find technical measures to complete advanced indicators; some units have not done a good job in ideological education; some factories have not responded to the rationalization proposals put forward by workers in the past, and this time the leading cadres have not expressed a clear attitude and determination, so the workers are still afraid that the leading cadres will not solve the problems, and therefore their enthusiasm is not high.

The plan formulation work of basic construction units and state-owned factories and mines in Datong City has also begun. The Datong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred more than thirty cadres to form five working groups to assist in key units.

    太原和大同两市厂矿发动职工讨论计划
    太原市国营厂矿和部分地方国营厂矿正在发动群众制订今年的生产、财务计划。中共太原市委在二月中旬召开了太原市各厂矿党、行政、工会、青年团领导干部会议，指出在订计划中要学习五三工厂的经验，加强政治思想领导，发动职工挖潜力，使计划建立在先进的技术措施基础之上。会后，中共太原市委、太原一区区委、太原二区区委共派出二十个工作组分别到各重点厂矿帮助工作。现在，太原钢铁厂、太原铁路工厂、东山煤矿等单位订计划工作已经展开。
    目前存在的问题是：有些单位的领导干部存在着保守思想；有的单位步骤紊乱，对关键问题不明确；有的单位只是扣数字，没有发动群众寻找完成先进指标的技术措施；有的单位思想教育工作做得不好；有的工厂过去对工人提出的合理化建议没有答复，这次领导干部也没有表示明确的态度和决心，所以工人们还是怕领导干部不解决问题，因而积极性不高。
    大同市各基本建设单位和国营厂矿的订计划工作也已开始。中共大同市委抽调了三十多个干部，组成五个工作组分别到各重点单位帮助。
