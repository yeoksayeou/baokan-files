Accumulating Funds for Large-Scale Construction
Zhou Zuoxin

What is the Key?

The Third Paper Mill has started discussing its production plan.

The key issue in this year's plan discussion was discovered during the work summary at the beginning of January – poor quality had affected the production of over 20,000 tons of paper throughout the year. According to feedback from superiors and users, the paper's problems were "loose and fuzzy, unclear printing" and "poor packaging, paper getting wet."

The "poor packaging" issue was relatively easy to solve. "Loose and fuzzy" was purely a technical problem, so they consulted Soviet experts. The experts pointed out two directions for improvement: one was to improve the equipment, and the other was to fix the ratio of chemical ingredients.

These two methods were not so simple to implement. The equipment already existed, but the workers had dismantled it long ago because they didn't know how to use it and were afraid of danger. The ratio of chemical ingredients was constantly being changed in an attempt to explore quality patterns. Naturally, the expert's words were correct, but the problem was how to mobilize the workers. Therefore, at the Party committee meeting on January 10th, it was decided to carry out education on this year's "Three Major Tasks" to deeply mobilize the workers.

Accumulating Funds for Economic Construction

Each of the Three Major Tasks was very inspiring; however, some workers still had some confused ideas. Some said, "Large-scale economic construction is about developing heavy industry, and it has little to do with our paper mill!" Others said, "We'll just keep producing and completing our tasks on schedule; the Five-Year Plan won't be held back by us!" Still others said, "If our factory gets a major overhaul, then I'll consider myself participating in economic construction!" In response to these ideological situations, the reporter began by saying, "Let's look at the facts!" Last year alone, the poor quality of cement bag paper resulted in enough lost cement to build a cement road from Harbin to Beijing; the newsprint was even worse, with the yard full of paper that couldn't be sold due to its poor quality. The reporter said, "Cement is a necessary material for large-scale economic construction, but because of our mistakes, so much of it was lost! The state provides funds for us to produce, but we stockpile it, preventing it from circulating, so the state has to provide more funds to maintain our production. ... If we don't stockpile it, wouldn't it be better for the state to use these funds for construction!" Everyone said, "Oh! So we're holding back economic construction!" The reporter continued, "From a positive perspective, if our product quality is good and sells quickly, the state's capital accumulation will be faster, and we will truly be participating in large-scale economic construction!" The workers understood this time, "So that's how it's related!" The more everyone discussed, the more reasonable it seemed, and their enthusiasm grew.

A Disappointing Letter

In early February, while the leading cadres were focusing on experimenting with improving quality in the Fifth Workshop, the Youth League Committee suddenly received a letter from the "China Youth Daily" in Beijing, stating that they had started using newsprint produced by the Third Paper Mill, but the quality of the paper was too bad, ... Because the paper was poor, the printing was unclear, which would hinder the progress of millions of young people. After the Youth League Committee reported the contents of the letter to the Party, the Party Secretary said, "Take it to the Fifth Workshop and read it out loud, to educate everyone!" As soon as Liu Genan, the secretary of the workshop's Youth League branch, finished reading, the workers' faces turned as red as if they had been slapped, especially the young league members (young workers accounted for the vast majority of this workshop). They immediately held a meeting, and everyone argued, saying, "We are all Youth League members, shouldn't we all be striving for progress? If we produce poorly and affect the progress of millions of young people, what kind of league members are we!" Everyone’s desire to improve quality burned like a raging fire.

To add fuel to the fire, another major event occurred just two days later: the "China Youth Daily" of February 10th, 13th, and 17th arrived. In those three consecutive days, only the February 13th newspaper (because February 14th was the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, and the newspaper printed portraits of leaders that day) did not use the Third Paper Mill's product (the workers could recognize which was their factory's product and which was from another factory). This time everyone was even more excited, and some league members jumped up and said, "The paper produced by our factory is not even qualified to print portraits of our own leaders, how shameful!" Everyone uses their brains and discuss plans

With everyone's enthusiasm boosted, the leadership began to bring the production plan targets to the workshops, pointed out the key areas, and announced the tasks. That day, eleven workers signed up to tackle the task of solving the quality problems. Zhang Yadong said, "Finding the knack this year is for laying the foundation for the Five-Year Plan!" Under the sway of this sentiment, everyone from the workshop director to the workers was constantly thinking about where to find the "knack." The Soviet expert’s suggestion to utilize the existing equipment was naturally brought to mind. In just two days, the glazing machine was installed, the grinder was installed, the slag remover, the steam pipes... were all found from the warehouse. The paper machine in this workshop originally did not have a cold cylinder, so they converted the steam roller into a cold cylinder. At a group discussion, while everyone was discussing how to eliminate yellow specks and yellow-white streaks, Wang Xingzhou, the deputy director of the workshop, just said, "Maybe installing that water spray pipe from the scrap iron pile on the copper mesh would work." League member Shang Guozheng immediately jumped up to get it. Everyone told him not to disrupt the meeting discipline; but in less than five minutes, he used the excuse of going to the bathroom to retrieve it and install it. Everyone wanted to criticize him, but also wanted to praise him. In this way, more than thirty tricks appeared in a few days, and they were solving problems while finding tricks. It was truly effective, the quality gradually improved, and in a few days, the quality of the Fifth Workshop was already very different from before.

After the good news from the Fifth Workshop was announced, the other workshops became even more anxious. The next day, Chen Yuan, the foreman of the Fourth Workshop, went to Lou Dianfen, the foreman of the Fifth Workshop, to learn from their experience, and started installing machines on the third day, and the quality also improved on the fourth day. Following that, the Third Workshop, the Second Workshop, and the First Workshop all followed suit. Each workshop found many new tricks, and in a few days, the entire factory had more than two hundred and forty large and small rationalization proposals.

Oppose Bureaucratism, Act According to Contracts

With so many rationalization proposals put forward, naturally not all of the problems could be solved by the workshops alone. For example, one of the reasons for the poor quality in the past was the poor quality of raw materials, the imperfect inspection system, and the lack of detailed testing. When the materials were issued to the workshops, it was also done carelessly, and the material specifications were frequently changed, affecting the ability to fix the chemical ingredient ratios, which should be the responsibility of the Supply and Marketing Section and the Technical Inspection Section. Since learning the Soviet paper selection method, the Labor and Wage Section, fearing trouble, temporarily suspended the piece-rate wage system, so advanced experience was never promoted. There were also some problems that were more directly related to the factory director. For example, when the glazing machine, wet paper sensitizing machine, and slag remover were dismantled in the past, the workers' reason was that they did not know how to use them and were afraid of danger (at that time, two people's hands were indeed injured by the wet paper sensitizing machine), but the factory director did not think of ways to help the workers technically, but only passively agreed to the workers dismantling them. Also, some safety and welfare facilities, etc., already had the conditions, and the factory director only needed to be diligent in inspection and supervision, but he did not do a good job. These opinions were brought to the leadership, which opened their minds again, "Yes! We should combine it with the struggle against bureaucracy!" Under the urging and enlightenment of the leading cadres, the sections and offices also took action. They not only had plans for the workshops, but also each group and each person formulated specific guarantee measures.

But even this was not thorough enough, so they simply fixed it with contracts! Thus, the production plans and specific measures discussed by each workshop were the first part, the plans and specific measures of each section and office were the second part, plus the safety and welfare issues that should be resolved, and on March 16th, the collective contract of the entire factory was successfully signed. Then, the entire factory launched a vigorous "double peak red" production competition day after day in every shift. ("Double peak" refers to output and quality.)

How is the Quality Really?

On March 14th, the Northeast Daily published on March 13th arrived at the factory director's office. The upper half of the front page was full of portraits of members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which were printed clearly and cleanly on the newspaper. Someone mentioned, "I wonder which factory's paper was used for today's newspaper?" With this mention, everyone started to study it, some said, "This is our paper!" Another person said, "No way, our product is not qualified enough!" Factory Director Zhang Bingyao also did not believe his own ability to distinguish, "Let's just ask!" The head of the Supply and Marketing Section made a special call to the Shenyang Northeast Daily to ask, and the answer received was: "It is paper from your factory, we hope you can maintain this quality standard!" This time everyone was happy, "Our paper is qualified to print portraits of leaders!" When this sentence was passed on to the workshops, the workers said, "Don't be satisfied, we also want the paper used to print the Northeast Daily to be on par with the paper used for the People's Daily."

    为大规模建设积累资金
    周作新
    关键何在
    第三造纸厂开始讨论生产计划了。
    今年讨论计划的关键问题在一月初总结去年工作的时候就发现了——因为质量不好，曾影响全年少生产两万多吨纸。据上级和用户的意见，纸的毛病是“松软起毛，印像不清”“包装不严，纸被浸湿”。
    “包装不严”问题比较容易解决：“松软起毛”可纯粹是技术问题，于是去请教苏联专家。专家给指出两个努力方向：一个是改进设备；一个是固定药料配合比。
    这两个办法做起来可不那么简单。设备原来就有，因为工人不会用、怕危险，早就拆掉了；药料的配合比也是因为想摸索出质量规律来才不断更换的。自然，专家的话是不会错的，问题在于怎样把工人发动起来。所以在一月十日的党委会议上，确定进行今年“三大任务”的教育，深入地发动工人。
    为经济建设积累资金
    三大任务每一项都是非常鼓舞人心的；然而也有部分工人还有着一些糊涂思想。有人说：“大规模经济建设是发展重工业，和咱造纸厂关系不大！”也有人说：“咱们照样生产，按期完成任务，五年计划拉不下咱们！”还有人说：“要是把咱们厂子大修一下子，我才算参加经济建设了呢！”针对这些思想情况，报告员开始讲了：“请大家看看事实吧！”去年一年，由于水泥袋纸质量不好，损失的水泥够修一条由哈尔滨到北京的水泥马路；新闻纸就更糟，院子里堆得满满的，都是质量不好卖不出去的。报告员说：“水泥是大规模经济建设的必需材料，可是由于咱们的过失就给损失了这么多！国家拿出资金让咱们生产，咱们给积压起来不能流通，国家就得再拿资金维持咱们生产。……如果我们不积压，国家拿这些资金去建设好不好呢！”大伙说：“噢！那么说咱们是扯了经济建设的后腿了！”报告员又说了：“从积极方面说，如果我们产品质量好，卖的快，国家资金积累的就快，我们才算是真正地参加了大规模经济建设！”工人这回都明白了，“原来关系在这儿哪！”大家越讨论越觉得有理，情绪也越来越高。
        一封“不得劲儿”的信
    二月上旬，领导干部正在第五车间重点试验提高质量工作的时候，青年团委员会突然接到由北京“中国青年报”来的一封信，说他们开始用第三造纸厂生产的新闻纸印刷了，可是纸的质量太坏，……由于纸张不好，印刷不清，就会妨碍千百万青年的进步。团委会向党汇报了这封信的内容之后，党委书记说：“拿到第五车间去宣读，借此教育教育大家！”车间团总支书记刘格南刚刚念完，工人的脸都像被巴掌打了似的红起来，特别是青年团员们（这个车间青年工人占绝大多数），马上就开了个大会，大家吵成一片，说：“咱们都是青年团员，大家要不要求进步？因为我们生产不好影响千百万青年进步，还算得什么团员！”每个工人要求提高质量的愿望像烈火一样地烧了起来。
    然而，火上浇油的是，隔不两天，又出了一件大事：二月十日、十三日、十七日的“中国青年报”来了，紧挨着的三天报纸，只有十三日（因十四日是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年，这天报纸登载了领袖像）的报纸没用第三造纸厂的产品（工人们都能认出来哪是本厂产品，哪是别厂产品），这回大家更激动了，有的团员跳起来说：“我们厂生产的纸竟没有资格印自己领袖的像片，该多可耻！”大家动脑筋，讨论计划
    大家的劲头都鼓足了，领导上就开始把生产计划指标拿到车间里去，并指出关键所在，公布了课题。当天就有十一名工人报名抢去了解决质量的课题。张亚东说：“今年找窍门为的是给五年计划扎根！”在这种情绪支配之下，从车间主任到工人，每一个人都成天在琢磨“窍门”的来路。苏联专家指出的利用原有设备的问题，自然而然地被大家想了起来。不两天，光泽机安上了，精磨机安上了，除渣机、蒸汽管……都从仓库里翻了出来。这个车间的抄纸机原来没有冷缸，他们就把蒸汽滚改成冷缸。在一次小组讨论会上，大家正在讨论怎样消灭黄疙疸、黄白道问题时，车间副主任王兴周刚说了一句：“把那边废铁堆里那个喷水管安在铜网上许能行。”团员商国政马上跳起来就要去取。大家告诉他不许破坏会议纪律；可是没过五分钟，他借口上厕所把它取回来安上了。把大家弄得又想批评他，又想表扬他。就是这样，几天当中就出现了窍门三十多件，一边找窍门一边就解决。真是立竿见影，质量逐步提高了，几天的工夫，第五车间的质量已经和以前大不相同了。
    第五车间的捷报公布之后，其他几个车间更着急了。第二天，第四车间的工长陈元就把第五车间的工长娄殿芬找去，向第五车间学习经验，第三天就动手安机器，第四天质量也提高了。随着三车间、二车间、一车间都跟了上来。各个车间又找出了许多新窍门，几天的工夫，全厂就出现了大大小小二百四十几项合理化建议。
    反对官僚主义，按合同办事
    合理化建议提出了这么多，其中自然不全是车间所能解决的问题。比如说，过去质量不好的原因之一是原材料不好，验收制度不健全，化验也不细致，往车间发的时候也马马虎虎，材料规格经常变换，影响药料配合不能固定，这就应该由供销科和技术检查科负责。自从学习苏联选纸法之后，劳动工薪科怕麻烦，暂时停止了计件工资制度，因而先进经验始终没推广。还有一些问题更直接牵涉到厂长。比如说以前拆掉光泽机、湿纸感光机、除渣机的时候，工人的理由是不会使，怕危险（当时确有两个人的手被湿纸感光机压伤过），但是厂长当时不是从技术上给工人想办法，而是只消极地同意工人拆掉。再如一些安全、福利设施等问题，本来都有条件，厂长只要勤于检查和督促就行，但是也没有做好。这些意见提到领导上，给领导干部又开了一下脑筋，“对呀！应该和反官僚主义斗争结合起来呀！”在领导干部的督促、启发之下，各科股也行动起来，他们不但都有了面向车间的计划，而且每个小组、每个人也都订出了具体保证措施。
    但是光这样还怕不彻底，索性用合同固定起来！于是各车间讨论的生产计划和具体措施算第一部分，各科股的计划和具体措施是第二部分，再加上应该解决的安全、福利等问题，在三月十六日，全厂的集体合同顺利地签了字。接着全厂就展开了轰轰烈烈的班班日日双峰红生产大竞赛。（“双峰”指产量和质量。）
    质量到底怎样了
    三月十四日这一天，十三日出版的东北日报来到厂长室了，第一版的上半版全是苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员的像片，印在报纸上既清晰又洁净。不知是谁提了一句：“今天的报纸不知是用了哪个工厂的纸？”经他这样一提，大家就研究起来了，有人说：“这是咱们出的！”另一个人说：“不会，咱们产品还不够资格！”厂长张炳耀也不相信自己的辨别能力了，“干脆问一问得了！”供销科长特地往沈阳东北日报社打了个电话一问，得到的回答是：“是你们工厂出的纸，希望你们能够保持住这个质量标准！”这回大家都高兴了：“我们的纸有资格印领袖像了！”这句话传到车间，工人们说：“别满足，咱们还要让印东北日报的纸向人民日报用的纸看齐。”    （转载东北日报）
