    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th - Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party is carrying out an election campaign for members of the Diet under the policy of establishing a united front against rearmament. After the Yoshida government suddenly announced the dissolution of the Diet on March 14th and the holding of new general elections, the Japanese Communist Party immediately held an election decision-making meeting on March 15th. Twenty people, including Kanegama Denichi, Hosokawa Kahoku, and Yoshida Sukesharu, attended the meeting. Under the direction of Tanaka Matsujiro of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, the meeting decided on the party's policy of a united front for the election. Party organizations in Kanto, Tokyo, and other regions have also held meetings to prepare for the election. The Japanese Communist Party's policy of establishing a united front for the election against rearmament has received a broad response and is gradually penetrating the masses. The Japanese Communist Party has formed a united front for the election with the Japan Labor-Farmer Party and the Socialist Party Reconstruction Liaison Council, and has nominated unified election candidates. The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions has decided to support candidates who oppose rearmament in the general election. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has also decided to nominate people who oppose rearmament to run for election. At the national Japan People's Peace Congress held in Tokyo in late March, a suggestion was made, calling on the Japanese people to nominate people who support any of the eight peace agendas adopted by the congress in the general election.
