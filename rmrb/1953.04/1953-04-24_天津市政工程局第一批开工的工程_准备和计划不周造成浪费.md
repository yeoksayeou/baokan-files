To promptly understand the progress of the first batch of municipal construction projects, the Tianjin Municipal Engineering Bureau organized some cadres to inspect the major construction sites. They discovered that due to rushed project preparation and inadequate planning, there were many urgent problems during construction. The first problem was that materials and tools were insufficiently prepared, not supplied in a timely manner, and of poor quality, resulting in wasted labor. For example, the eighth team at the Zhongshanmen construction site, with one hundred and five workers, only received forty shovels and thirty picks. On the first day of work, there was partial work stoppage due to a lack of tools. At the Southwest Building sewer construction site, seven or eight thousand concrete pipes of various sizes should have been delivered by March 24th, but only a little over a thousand had been delivered by the 27th. The most urgently needed pipes at the construction site were small pipes with a diameter of 25 centimeters, but the first batch delivered were large pipes with a diameter of about one meter. There were also cases of waste due to mismatched material specifications, resulting in using large materials for small purposes.

In terms of engineering design and technical preparation, some problems were also discovered. For example, after surveying the Wangchuanchang sewer construction site, it was discovered that it conflicted with underground water pipes. At the Zhongshanmen, Wujiayao, and Zhuanmatou road construction sites, it was discovered after construction began that the roadbed was too soft. The original design for the Wujiayao New Village road surface called for rolling with a six-ton steamroller, but because the Weijin River began to be dredged and water was pumped into the abandoned Qiangzi River, the groundwater level at Wujiayao rose, and the foundation could not withstand such heavy pressure. As a result, even a two-and-a-half-ton steamroller could not be used. These phenomena were caused by not conducting thorough investigation and research work before the design. The demolition of obstacles in the Worker's Road and Jinzhonghe North Dry Canal sewer projects was carried out too late, affecting the progress of the projects, which caused work stoppages on Workers' Road. At the Wujiayao construction site, construction surveying only began after the workers arrived at the site. The workers were chasing the surveyors for work, which affected the quality of the surveying work, and errors occurred frequently.

During the inspection, it was also discovered that the leaders at each construction site did not pay enough attention to the workers' living and working conditions, and there were many shortcomings in housing, food, and medical equipment. After the inspection, the Tianjin Municipal Engineering Bureau immediately instructed the relevant departments to actively study and resolve the problems, taking into account their importance and urgency. The chaotic situation at the construction sites has improved.

    天津市政工程局第一批开工的工程
    准备和计划不周造成浪费
    天津市市政工程局为及时了解第一批开工的市政建设工程进展情况，组织部分干部到各主要工地进行了检查；发现由于工程准备仓促，计划不周，目前在施工中存在着许多急需解决的问题。首先是材料、工具准备不足，供应不及时，质量太坏，造成了窝工。如中山门工地第八队一百零五个工人，只发了铁锨四十张，洋镐三十把，开工第一天就因工具不够而局部窝工。西南楼下水道工地，三月二十四日前应运到各种洋灰管七、八千节，但到二十七日为止，只运去一千多节；工地上首先需要的是直径二十五公分的小管，而第一批运到的却是直径一公尺左右的大管。还有些材料由于规格不符，造成了大材小用的浪费现象。
    在工程设计和施工技术的准备方面，也发现了一些问题。如王串场下水道工地放线以后，发现与地下的自来水管冲突；中山门、吴家窑、砖码头等道路工程工地，开工后发现路基太软；吴家窑新村路面原设计用六吨汽辗辗压，但因为卫津河开始疏浚后，把水抽入废墙子河，吴家窑地下水位提高，地基承受不住这样大的重压，结果连两吨半的汽辗都不能使用。这些现象都是由于设计前没有做好调查研究工作而造成的。工人路、金钟河北干沟等下水道工程中，拆迁障碍物的工作进行得太晚，影响了工程的进度，其中工人路曾因此造成窝工现象。吴家窑工地，在工人到达工地后，才开始施工测量，工人追着测量员要工作，影响了测量工作的质量，经常发生错误。
    在检查中，还发现各工地领导方面对工人的生活和劳动条件注意不够，住房、伙食、医疗设备等都有很多缺点。检查之后，天津市市政工程局即责成各有关部门分别问题的轻重缓急，积极研究解决。现工地混乱情况已有好转。
