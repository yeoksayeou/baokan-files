In the 1952 Patriotic Increase Production Movement, rural Youth League organizations and Youth League members played a huge role.

In 1952, rural Youth League organizations and Youth League members across the country actively united the vast number of young people to participate in the Patriotic Increase Production Movement and became a shock force in the movement.

During the Patriotic Increase Production Movement, rural Youth League members and the vast number of young people actively struggled to increase yield per unit area, and many high-yield models and high-yield units emerged. According to a survey of six counties in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shandong, Zhejiang and other provinces, more than 80% of League members participated in last year's Patriotic Increase Production Competition. Many of the League members and youth who participated in the competition achieved high yields. In the first batch of agricultural high-yield award lists announced by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in 1952, there were 24 young high-yield models. Last year, in Shanxi Province, the number of units led by League members and youth that met the high-yield award standards of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the Provincial Department of Agriculture reached 1,950.

The reason why rural League members and youth were able to play such a role in the Patriotic Increase Production Movement was mainly because they actively participated in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, which promoted production on the basis of being organized. Last year, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the country made great progress, and rural Youth League members were active participants in this movement. Of the more than 4 million League members in rural areas across the country, approximately 3 million participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In old liberated areas, about 80% of League members and 50% of youth participated in various types of mutual aid and cooperation organizations; in newly liberated areas, about 50% of League members participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Many League members became key members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

In order to assist the Party in doing a good job in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the League organizations in many regions strengthened education on patriotism, the direction of rural economic development, and mutual aid and cooperation policies to rural League members and young people last year. League organizations in the Northeast generally led and organized League members to participate in Party rectification and collective training to improve their understanding and awareness. League members who had previously been ineffective in mutual aid and cooperation organizations also became active. In areas where land reform had just ended, League organizations also conducted education to address the ideological problems of League members and youth, such as complacency, the belief that "the revolution has been successful," and a lack of understanding of the direction of rural economic development.

Over the past year, League organizations in various regions have also achieved success in actively leading League members and youth in learning agricultural production technology and promoting advanced experience. According to statistics from four provinces in the Northeast, 200,000 young people received training in agricultural technology training classes organized by the People's Government last year. In Hebei Province, approximately 90% of rural League members received direct or indirect education during the technical training month in June last year. In the visits, mass seasonal evaluations, and autumn harvest summary evaluations held in various places, many League organizations planned to mobilize League members to participate and conduct on-site practical observation. For example, the Songjiang County League Working Committee in Jiangsu Province contacted the Party and government departments and organized 605 League members and youth in two groups to visit the actual production activities of Chen Yongkang, a national rice high-yield model, and held discussions with elderly farmers to study and promote Chen Yongkang's experience in high-yield rice production.

Last year, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, League organizations in various regions achieved the above achievements in agricultural production. However, there are still many problems in the agricultural production work of rural Leagues in various places that need to be solved urgently.

First, some rural League cadres and League members have one-sided and erroneous views on rural work and agricultural production. They lack the idea of long-term construction in rural areas, have insufficient understanding of the important position of agricultural production in large-scale economic construction, and believe that agricultural production "has no future" and "will not be promising even in socialism." They want to enter the city, wait for transfer, and are not at ease with rural work.

Second, some League committees have not regarded agricultural production as the central task of the League in rural areas, leading the activities of the rural League with agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation as the center, or they are just shouting about production without actually facing production. In some places, the Party leads the masses in production, while the League organization is only busy leading young people to engage in cultural studies, League classes, and other things.

Third, many rural League cadres and League members have not conscientiously studied and implemented the Party's agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation policies. In their work, they are greedy for more and bigger things, are impatient and rash, blindly pursue advanced forms, discriminate against and attack individual households, forcibly compile mutual aid groups, and develop serious commandism and formalism. When some League committees assign work to lower levels, they do not take into account the status and ability of young people in their families, and they make excessive and urgent demands; they only assign tasks without specifically explaining policies and practices, and they lack inspection and assistance, which leads to continuous fatigue and illness among young people in production. Individual League organizations even take the wrong measures of suspending or expelling League members who fail to complete "tasks." Therefore, grassroots cadres complain that the higher-level League committee is "only using livestock without feeding them." There are also a few League committees that make false reports and report false models.

Fourth, League organizations in various regions have not yet made it a regular and important task to lead League members and youth to learn and promote advanced high-yield experience and agricultural technology. Some League members and youth still have the phenomenon of despising agricultural cultivation techniques and disrespecting elderly farmers with production experience. Some League cadres lack the necessary agricultural production knowledge and do not actively study and delve into it. They provide poor encouragement and support for young people's creations and inventions. As a result, the League cannot play a greater role in agricultural production.

In the future, League organizations in various regions must pay attention to overcoming the above shortcomings, continue to strengthen education on patriotism and "organizing" in this year's agricultural production work, conscientiously implement the Party's various policies on agricultural production, correct the tendency of impatience and rashness that does not proceed from the current production situation of the small peasant economy, learn agricultural production knowledge, establish a realistic and pragmatic work style, and give greater play to the role of the League in agricultural production work.

### 在一九五二年爱国增产运动中  农村青年团组织和青年团员发挥巨大作用

    在一九五二年爱国增产运动中
    农村青年团组织和青年团员发挥巨大作用
    一九五二年全国各地农村青年团组织和青年团员，积极团结广大青年参加了爱国增产运动，并成为运动中的一支突击力量。
    在爱国增产运动中，农村青年团员和广大青年都积极为提高单位面积产量而斗争，涌现了许多丰产模范和丰产单位。据黑龙江、吉林、山东、浙江等省六个县的调查，有百分之八十以上的团员参加了去年的爱国增产竞赛运动。参加竞赛的团员和青年，不少人都获得高额丰产。在中央人民政府农业部公布的一九五二年度第一批农业丰产奖励名单中，青年丰产模范就有二十四名。去年山西全省合乎中央农业部和省农业厅的丰产奖励标准的团员和青年领导的单位达一千九百五十个。
    农村团员和青年所以能在爱国增产运动中发挥这样的作用，主要是因为他们积极参加了互助合作运动，在组织起来的基础上推动了生产。去年全国互助合作运动有很大开展，农村青年团员是这一运动的积极参加者。全国农村四百多万团员约有三百万人参加了互助合作组织。在老区，约有百分之八十的团员和百分之五十的青年参加了各种类型的互助合作组织；在新区，约有百分之五十左右的团员参加了互助合作组织。并有不少团员成为互助合作组织中的骨干分子。
    为了协助党搞好互助合作运动，许多地区团的组织都在去年向农村团员和青年群众加强了爱国主义、农村经济发展方向及互助合作政策的教育。东北团的组织曾较普遍地领导和组织团员参加了整党和集训，提高了他们的认识和觉悟。过去在互助合作组织中有些不起作用的团员也积极起来。在土地改革结束不久的地区，团的组织并针对团员和青年的麻痹松懈、认为“革命成功”、不了解农村经济发展方向等思想问题进行了教育。
    一年来，各地团的组织积极领导团员和青年在学习农业生产技术和推广先进经验方面也获得成绩。据东北四个省统计，去年就有二十万青年到人民政府举办的农业技术训练班受过训练。河北省约有百分之九十的农村团员，在去年六月技术传授月中直接间接地受到教育。在各地举行的参观、群众性的季节评比和秋收总结评比中，不少团的组织有计划地动员团员前往参加，就地实习观摩。如江苏松江县团工委与党、政府部门联系，前后两次组织团员和青年六百零五人，参观了全国水稻丰产模范陈永康的实际生产活动，并和老年农民一道座谈研究，大大地推广了陈永康水稻丰产的经验。
    去年各地团的组织在各级党委领导下，在农业生产方面，虽然取得了以上的成绩，但是各地农村团在农业生产工作上还存在着许多问题急待解决。
    首先，有些农村团的干部和团员，对农村工作和农业生产存在着片面的错误观点，缺乏长期建设农村的思想，对农业生产在大规模经济建设中的重要地位认识不足，认为农业生产“没前途”、“到了社会主义也没出息”，想进城，等待转业，不安心农村工作。
    第二、有的团委尚未把农业生产当作团在农村压倒一切的中心工作，以农业生产互助合作为中心去领导农村团的活动，或者是空喊生产，实际上并未真正做到面向生产。在有的地方，党领导群众在搞生产，而团组织却只忙于领导青年从事学文化、上团课等事情。
    第三、有不少农村团的干部和团员没有认真地学习和执行党的农业生产互助合作政策，在工作中贪多贪大、急躁冒进、盲目追求高级形式和歧视打击单干户、强迫编制互助组、发展着严重的强迫命令、形式主义的作风。有些团委对下级布置工作时，不顾及青年在家庭中的地位和能力，要求过多过急；只布置任务，不具体交代政策和作法，又缺乏检查和帮助，致使青年在生产中劳累、生病的现象不断发生。个别团的组织，甚至对完不成“任务”的团员采取错误的停止、开除团籍的处分。因此基层干部埋怨上级团委是“光使牲口不喂料”。还有少数团委有作假报告、报假模范的事发生。
    第四、各地团的组织还没有把领导团员、青年学习和推广先进丰产经验和农业技术当做经常的重要工作去进行。有些团员和青年还有轻视农业耕作技术，不尊重有生产经验的老年农民的现象。有些团的干部既缺乏必要的农业生产知识，又不去积极学习和钻研，对青年在生产中的创造和发明，鼓励和支持很差，这样，就使得团在农业生产中不能发挥更大的作用。
    今后各地团的组织必须注意克服以上缺点，在今年的农业生产工作中继续加强爱国主义和“组织起来”的教育，认真地贯彻执行党的农业生产的各项政策，纠正不从小农经济的生产现状出发的急躁冒进的偏向，学习农业生产知识，树立实事求是、深入踏实的工作作风，更大地发挥团在农业生产工作中的作用。
