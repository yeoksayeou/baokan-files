    On the occasion of "May 1st" International Labor Day, on behalf of the Chinese workers and working people, I would like to extend our highest respects and warm congratulations to the great Soviet working people who are victoriously engaged in communist construction. Every achievement of the Soviet Union, the strong fortress of world peace, in its march towards communism, inspires the Chinese and the world working class and working people with the courage and confidence to struggle for a happy new life. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class has rapidly restored production and has begun the first five-year plan for large-scale national economic construction this year, which is inseparable from the sincere and selfless assistance of the great allied country, the Soviet Union.
    Long live the unbreakable friendly alliance between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the victory of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the solidarity of the working class of the world!
