The state-owned "September 3rd" Mechanical Farm in Northeast China is actively preparing for spring plowing and planting. After the farm's employees underwent Party rectification, winter training, and established production and financial plans, their enthusiasm for work is very high. Although the thaw came nearly a month earlier this year than in previous years, the farm's spring plowing preparations have not been affected. The farm first reorganized its labor organization, implemented a system of dedicated zones with full responsibility, and transferred a large number of cadres and technical personnel to production teams to strengthen the grassroots. This thoroughly corrected the past phenomenon of being top-heavy, overstaffed, and lacking individual accountability, laying a favorable foundation for this year's spring plowing.

The farm concentrated its efforts on repairing and maintaining mechanical farm implements. As of March 15th, it had completed the maintenance of all machinery and overhauled 21 tractors. There was also ample preparation of fuel for the machines. The spring wheat, soybeans, and miscellaneous grain seeds used by the farm have all been carefully selected, and germination tests and disinfectant preparations have been completed. The farm's second operational area has distributed seeds to each production team in preparation for spring sowing. This year, the farm changed the old habit of not applying fertilizer in the Northeast region and plans to apply 20 tons of fertilizer per hectare. The second operational area has completed the transportation of manure fertilizer for 316 hectares of land, and the fourth operational area has decided to apply 250 tons of manure fertilizer this year. Other operational areas are also moving and transporting fertilizer, ensuring that spring wheat sowing will not be delayed.

In the spring plowing preparation work, each tractor driver of the farm's locomotive team has incorporated the recovery of waste oil into the savings plan based on the actual situation (after use, at least 30 percent of waste oil can be recovered; last year, due to lack of attention, only 11 percent was recovered, and the rest was wasted in the fields). Tractor driver Zhang Yukun created a sowing method that connects two seeders front and back, reducing the original row spacing of 15 centimeters to 7.5 centimeters. This shortens the row spacing for spring wheat sowing and increases plant spacing, making the crop grow more evenly and robustly. His method has been widely promoted throughout the farm.

    国营“九三”机械农场积极准备春耕
    东北国营“九三”机械农场积极准备春耕春种。该场职工经过整党、冬训和订出生产、财务计划以后，工作情绪很高，今年解冻时间虽然较往年提早近一个月，但该场的春耕准备工作并未受到影响。该场首先整顿了劳动组织，实行了专区专责一包到底的制度，并已将大批干部、技术人员调派到生产队以充实基层，彻底纠正了过去头重脚轻、人浮于事、事事无人负责的现象，给今年春耕工作打下了一个有利的基础。
    该场集中力量修配了机械农具。到三月十五日为止，已作完了全部机具的保养工作，并大修了拖拉机二十一台；机器所需的油料也有了充分准备。该场所用的春小麦、大豆和杂粮种子都已经过精选，并做好了发芽试验及消毒药品的准备工作。该场第二作业区已将种子分配到各生产队，准备春播。今年该场改变了过去东北地区不施肥的旧习惯，准备每垧地施二十吨肥料。第二作业区已运完三百十六垧地的厩肥，第四作业区决定今年施厩肥二百五十吨，其他各作业区也在倒肥、运肥，保证决不耽误春小麦播种。
    在春耕准备工作中，该场机车组的每个拖拉机手，都已根据实际情况，把收回废机油订入了节约计划（机油使用后，最少可收回废机油百分之三十，去年由于大家不注意，只收回了百分之十一，其余的都浪费到地里了）。拖拉机手张玉昆创造了用两台播种机前后联结，把原来十五公分的行距缩小成为七点五公分的播种方法，这样就作到缩短春小麦播种的行距，加大株距，使作物生育的更均匀健壮。他的这个办法已在全场普遍推广。（中央农业部国营农场管理总局东北农场检查工作小组）
