The news, "The East China Construction Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building Mobilizes Employees to Inspect Waste Phenomena in Construction," published in this newspaper on April 5th, has already begun to attract the attention of the basic construction departments of the First Ministry of Machine Building. The Basic Construction Engineering Bureau of the ministry specifically invited the managers of the East China, Central South, Beijing, Shenyang, and Changchun Construction Engineering Companies, and the East China and Northeast Electromechanical Installation Engineering Companies, as well as responsible cadres from various departments of the bureau, to a symposium on the evening of April 6th. They discussed how to implement the opposition to waste and lack of accountability, and gradually establish and improve the responsibility system, in the current efforts to improve the organizational structure of construction departments and strengthen construction planning management.

The comrades who attended the symposium, based on past waste in construction and problems in this year's construction preparations, unanimously agreed that launching a mass movement before and after construction begins, exposing waste and lack of accountability, summarizing experiences, and educating employees to establish an economic accounting perspective, is precisely "prescribing the right medicine." Wei Liangtian, manager of Shenyang Construction Engineering Company, said that waste in basic construction, apart from that caused by design errors, is extremely common and serious from material procurement, transportation, management, to use. For example, procurement personnel do not understand material specifications, and the materials purchased do not meet the needs of the project, often resulting in material backlog; management personnel do not understand material performance or lack management regulations, causing materials to deteriorate and affecting project quality, etc. Wei Liangtian used the example of the Northeast Machinery No. 11 Factory to illustrate this problem. Last year, Northeast Machinery No. 11 Factory built a 9,000-square-meter machine shop. The machine shop had more than 140 columns, of which more than 110 were of poor quality, and the most serious ones required rework. Wang Ruifeng from Beijing Construction Engineering Company said that the Beijing Tractor School project has suffered distressing waste due to long-term lack of accountability. The design drawings for this school have not yet been released, but two years ago, the former Central Heavy Industry Department's Automobile Preparatory Group purchased a lot of cement, wood, steel bars and other materials and stored them on the construction site. Due to lack of responsible management, 400 tons of cement have hardened and deteriorated, about 1.5 billion yuan worth of wood has rotted and cannot be used, and the steel bars have also rusted.

The comrades who participated in the symposium explained from this year's construction preparations that it is very necessary to launch a mass anti-waste movement now. Gao Zhizhong, deputy director of the Labor and Wages Department of the bureau, used the situation at the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School construction site to illustrate this problem. He said that although there are now 3,000 permanent workers on the site, many unqualified workers have also been hired because no one was responsible for reviewing the permanent workers. According to preliminary investigation, there are 20 old workers over 60 years old and 40 child laborers under 16 years old. The project has not yet started, and nearly 30 percent are already sick. The Beijing Construction Engineering Company, which leads this construction site, now has only three section-level cadres. The site director is a transferred cadre who is very active in his work but lacks experience. Gao Zhizhong said that if the cadres are not immediately replenished, the organizational structure is not improved, an anti-waste struggle is not launched, the phenomenon of no one being responsible is not opposed, and a responsibility system is not established now, it will be difficult to guarantee the progress and quality of the project in the future, and waste will be difficult to avoid.

Finally, Li An, director of the Basic Construction Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, pointed out: In the second quarter, each engineering company should fully mobilize employees to check and expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible and waste in last year's projects and this year's preparatory work, and use specific materials to conduct economic accounting education among employees, so as to establish and improve various responsibility systems.

    第一机械工业部基本建设工程局开座谈会
    号召所属开展反对施工浪费斗争
    四月五日本报发表“第一机械工业部华东建筑工程公司发动职工群众检查施工中的浪费现象”的新闻以后，已经开始引起第一机械工业部基本建设施工部门的注意。该部基本建设工程局特于四月六日晚邀请所属华东、中南、北京、沈阳、长春等建筑工程公司和华东、东北机电安装工程公司经理，以及该局各处负责干部座谈，讨论怎样在当前健全施工部门的组织机构和加强施工计划管理工作中，贯彻反对浪费和无人负责现象，逐渐建立和健全责任制度。
    参加座谈会的同志们，根据过去施工中的浪费情况和今年施工准备中的问题，一致认为在开工前后，展开一个群众性的运动，揭露浪费和无人负责现象，从中总结经验，教育职工，树立经济核算观点，正是“对症下药”。沈阳建筑工程公司魏良田经理说，基本建设中的浪费现象，除因设计的错误所造成的以外，从材料的采购、运输、管理到使用所产生的浪费是极其普遍而严重的。如采购人员不懂材料规格，买来的材料不合工程需要，常常造成材料积压；管理人员不懂得材料性能，或者缺乏管理规程，使材料变质，影响工程质量等等。魏良田以东北机械十一厂的实例，说明这一问题。东北机械十一厂去年建筑一座九千平方公尺的机工房，这座机工房有一百四十多根柱子，其中就有一百一十几根的质量不好，最严重的十几根需要返工。北京建筑工程公司王瑞峰同志说，北京拖拉机学校工程，由于长期处于无人负责状态，造成了令人痛心的浪费。这所学校的设计图现在还没出来，但在两年前，原中央重工业部汽车筹备组就购买了很多水泥、木材、钢筋等材料存放在工地里，由于无人负责保管，到现在，已有四百吨水泥硬化变质，约值十五亿元的木材已腐烂不能使用，钢筋亦已生锈。
    参加座谈会的同志从今年的施工准备中说明现在开展群众性的反浪费运动是十分必要的。该局劳动工资处副处长高志忠同志以北京机器制造学校工地的情况来说明这个问题。他说，这个工地现在虽有三千个固定工人，但是，因为在固定工人时审查工作无人负责，以致许多不合格的工人也收下来了。据初步调查，六十岁以上的老工有二十人，十六岁以下的童工有四十人。现在还没有开工，而病号就将近百分之三十。领导这个工地的北京建筑工程公司现在只有三个科长级干部，工地主任是一位转业干部，工作很积极，但没有经验。高志忠说，如果现在不马上充实干部，健全组织机构展开反浪费斗争，反对无人负责现象，建立责任制度，将来工程的进度和质量是很难保证的，浪费现象是很难避免的。
    最后，第一机械工业部基本建设工程局李安局长指出：各工程公司在第二季度进行健全机构和施工准备工作中，应该充分发动职工检查和揭发去年的工程和今年的准备工作中的无人负责现象和浪费现象，用具体的材料，在职工中进行经济核算教育，以便建立和健全各种责任制度。
