Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The US government's ambition to seize control of the Vietnam War under the guise of "using Asians to fight Asians" has increasingly aroused suspicion in French ruling circles.

    During his recent conspiratorial activities in Vietnam, Clark suggested that France vigorously expand the Bao Dai puppet army and arranged for US officers "experienced" in training South Korean puppet troops to "visit" Vietnam.

    Clark's "visit" and suggestions have caused unease among French ruling circles. The British "Times" said that some French commentators have expressed "concern" that Clark may suggest "sending a large US military delegation" to Vietnam to train Bao Dai puppet troops on a large scale. Peter Groening, United Press Southeast Asia branch manager, also said on the 23rd: "French officials welcome US aid, but they believe that the United States is only providing supplies and therefore has no right to interfere in Indochina's strategy."

    French Prime Minister Mayer is currently in Washington negotiating with the United States, begging the United States to provide more assistance for France's war of aggression against Vietnam. Within the French ruling circles, some people are shouting, "The French Union must be maintained." The French "Volunteers' Daily" said: Bidault and Letourneau fear that "the United States will propose conditions that call into question the unity of the French Union." Another French bourgeois newspaper, "Combat," said that the increase in US "aid" to Indochina has made some French ministers strongly feel that "this new situation may lead to many new crises of political interference in Indochina on the part of the United States."

    美国要夺取越南战争控制权引起了法国统治集团的疑惧
    据新华社讯：美国政府在“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的幌子下急图攫取越南战争控制权的野心，已越来越引起了法国统治集团的疑惧。
    克拉克最近在越南进行阴谋活动时，曾建议法国大力扩充保大伪军，并安排了由训练南朝鲜伪军“富有经验的”美国军官到越南“访问”。
    克拉克的“访问”和建议在法国统治集团中引起了不安。英国“泰晤士报”说，法国某些评论家对克拉克可能建议“派遣一个庞大的美国军事代表团”到越南大量训练保大伪军，引起“疑虑”。合众社东南亚分社经理彼得·格罗宁在二十三日也说：“法国官员们欢迎美国的援助，但是他们认为美国只是给予供应品罢了，因此无权过问印度支那的战略。”
    目前法国总理迈耶正在华盛顿和美国进行谈判，乞求美国对法国的侵越战争给予更多的援助。在法国统治集团中就有一部分人发出“必须保持法兰西联邦”的叫喊。法国“义勇军报”说：皮杜尔、勒杜尔诺惧怕“美国提出使法兰西联邦的统一成问题的条件”。法国另一资产阶级报纸“战斗报”说：美国对印度支那“援助”的增加，使法国某些部长强烈感觉到：“这种新局势可能引起美国方面许多对印度支那政治干涉的新危机”。
