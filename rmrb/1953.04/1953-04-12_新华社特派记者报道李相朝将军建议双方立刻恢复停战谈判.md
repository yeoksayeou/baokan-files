    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 11th: Our special correspondent reports: The liaison groups of both sides signed the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war at noon today. With the signing of this agreement, the issue of immediately resuming armistice negotiations to comprehensively resolve the POW and Korean armistice issues has been placed on the agenda.
    General Li Xiangchao suggested immediately reconvening a full meeting of the negotiating delegations of both sides to "discuss and resolve the entire POW issue in order to realize an armistice in Korea." He pointed out that the American Commander Clark had expressed his agreement in his reply to the view that a reasonable solution to the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war on both sides during the war should lead to a smooth resolution of the entire POW issue.
    No date was decided today for the resumption of armistice negotiations because Daniel suggested that the liaison group meeting be adjourned first, pending notification through his liaison officers. General Li Xiangchao agreed to the adjournment, but suggested that a meeting of the liaison group should be convened within a day or two to discuss the date for the resumption of armistice negotiations. Daniel agreed.
    The agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war was signed in a tent in Panmunjom by General Li Xiangchao, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese liaison group, and Major General Daniel, the chief member of the American liaison group. Outside the tent, about one hundred reporters and photographers from both sides gathered.
    Before signing, General Li Xiangchao read a statement, pointing out that the Korean-Chinese side reserves the right to request that the sick and wounded prisoners of war on our side who have not been repatriated this time be transferred to neutral countries to ensure that their repatriation issue can be resolved fairly after the armistice.
    The major efforts made by the Korean-Chinese side for peace have cleared the way for immediately resuming delegation meetings to resolve the entire POW issue—the only obstacle to the Korean armistice. Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung recently put forward new proposals for resolving this outstanding issue. Subsequently, General Nam Il fully explained this proposal in a letter to Mr. Harrison, the chief representative of the American side, which was forwarded yesterday through the liaison group meeting. Li Xiangchao has now suggested discussing the issue of resuming delegation meetings. The specific methods for implementing the new proposals of the Korean-Chinese side can be discussed at delegation meetings seeking a comprehensive solution to the POW issue.
    Peace-loving people all over the world are watching Panmunjom, wanting to see if the American government has the sincerity to seek an armistice in Korea. Immediately resuming armistice negotiations to resolve the entire POW issue will be a decisive test of this sincerity.

    新华社特派记者报道李相朝将军建议双方立刻恢复停战谈判
    【新华社开城十一日电】本社特派记者报道：双方联络组今天中午在关于遣返病伤被俘人员的协定上签了字。随着这个协定的签字，立刻恢复停战谈判以全面解决战俘和朝鲜停战问题的问题已经提到日程上来了。
    李相朝将军建议立刻重开双方谈判代表团的全体会议，来“讨论并解决整个战俘问题，以实现朝鲜的停战”。他指出，美方司令官克拉克曾在他的答复里表示同意下述看法：战争期间交换双方病伤战俘问题的合理解决，应导致整个战俘问题的顺利解决。
    今天没有决定恢复停战谈判的日期，因为丹尼尔建议联络组会议先行休会，以待通过他的联络官员的通知。李相朝将军同意休会，但建议应在一两天内召开联络组的会议，来讨论恢复停战谈判的日期。丹尼尔同意了。
    关于遣返病伤战俘的协定在板门店帐篷里由朝中联络组首席组员李相朝将军和美方联络组首席组员丹尼尔少将签了字。在帐篷外面，聚集着双方的约一百个记者和摄影记者。
    签字以前，李相朝将军宣读了一项声明，指出朝中方面保留要求将这次没有遣返的我方伤病被俘人员转交中立国，以保证他们的遣返问题能在停战后获得公正解决的权利。
    朝中方面为和平而作的重大努力，给立刻恢复代表团会议解决整个战俘问题——朝鲜停战的唯一障碍——扫清了道路。周恩来总理和金日成首相最近曾为解决这个未决问题提出了新的建议。接着，南日大将在昨天经过联络组会议转交的致美方首席代表哈利逊的信里又对这个建议作了充分的说明。李相朝现在已经建议讨论恢复代表团会议的日期问题。实施朝中方面的新建议的具体办法，可以在谋战俘问题的全面解决的代表团会议上讨论。
    全世界爱好和平的人民都在注视着板门店，想要看一看美国政府有没有诚意谋求朝鲜的停战。立刻恢复停战谈判以解决全部战俘问题一点，将是对于这种诚意的决定性的考验。
