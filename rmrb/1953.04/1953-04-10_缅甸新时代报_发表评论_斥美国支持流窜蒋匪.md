    "Burma New Age" Publishes Commentary
    Denouncing U.S. Support for Fleeing Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eighth dispatch] The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has passed a motion to include the Burmese government's accusation of aggression against Burma by the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang on the agenda of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. government is trying to deny its open support for the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang fleeing into Burma.
    According to the "New York Herald Tribune" Rangoon correspondent, the Rangoon "Burma New Age" published a commentary on this, saying: "No denial by the Americans can convince the Burmese people that the Kuomintang army in Burma could strengthen itself in manpower and material resources without the tacit consent and support of the United States, whether the support comes from the Pentagon or Taipei." The newspaper also said: "The Burmese people do not approve of the new U.S. foreign policy of letting Asians fight Asians, nor do they approve of the U.S. plan to support the Kuomintang army on Burmese territory to disturb their friendly neighbors and provoke China. ... If responsible people in the United States expect the Burmese people to be accomplices in their dirty conspiracy to support the Kuomintang within Burma, they are mistaken."

    “缅甸新时代报”发表评论
    斥美国支持流窜蒋匪
    【新华社八日讯】联合国大会总务委员会已通过将缅甸政府控诉台湾国民党匪帮侵略缅甸的议案列入联合国第七届大会议程。美国政府正力图狡赖它对流窜缅甸的国民党匪帮残余部队的公然支持。
    据纽约“先驱论坛报”仰光通讯，仰光“缅甸新时代报”对此发表评论说：“美国人的任何否认都不能使缅甸人民相信，在缅甸的国民党军队没有美国的默许和支持而能在人力和物力上加强，无论支持是来自五角大楼或台北。”该报还说：“缅甸人民不赞成美国的让亚洲人打亚洲人的新外交政策，也不赞成美国计划在缅甸领土上扶植国民党军队来扰乱他们的友好邻国，向中国挑衅。……如果美国的负责人士指望缅甸人民成为他们在缅甸境内扶植国民党的肮脏阴谋的走狗，那就错了。”
