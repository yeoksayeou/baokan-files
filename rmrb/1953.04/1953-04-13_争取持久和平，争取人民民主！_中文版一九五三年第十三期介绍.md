The Chinese edition of the Cominform's organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 13, 1953, was published on the 11th.

This issue features an editorial entitled "The Great and Unbreakable Friendship Among Free Peoples." The editorial points out: A new type of relationship has been formed among the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is full of the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The large-scale peaceful construction of the Soviet Union, the achievements of the People's Republic of China, and the achievements of the European People's Democratic countries are regarded by all progressive mankind as great contributions to the cause of striving for world peace and consolidating international friendship. The editorial continues: The people of the socialist camp vigilantly safeguard the achievements of the people's power and are always ready to ruthlessly punish anyone who dares to infringe upon and endanger their freedom and independence. No force in the world can weaken the friendship and alliance of free peoples.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Lenin and Stalin on the New Type of Political Party" by Iosif Chișinevschi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; "People's Friendship - A Great and Invincible Idea" by József Révai, Member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party; and "Palmiro Togliatti - Leader of the Italian Communists and Working People" by Pietro Secchia, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party.

Chișinevschi's article outlines the basic principles and instructions of Comrades Lenin and Stalin on establishing a new type of working-class party, and points out that one of Comrade Stalin's greatest historical contributions was that he defended and brilliantly developed Lenin's theory of the party in the struggle against the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and other traitors, enriching the theory of the party with arguments of great significance to the world communist movement. These arguments include: mastering and creatively applying Marxism, carrying out resolute struggles against various opportunists, strengthening criticism and self-criticism, and constantly consolidating the close ties between the party and the masses. Lenin and Stalin's theory of the party is the guide for the actions of communist and workers' parties in all countries and is a solid foundation for winning the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. Today, when the great Stalin has parted with us forever, the banner of Marxism-Leninism is being carried forward by the tested leading body of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a model for all communist and workers' parties. Communist and workers' parties in all countries express their infinite gratitude and loyalty to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Leninist-Stalinist leadership. The red flag of proletarian internationalism will more firmly unite the international working class around the Lenin-Stalin Party.

Révai's article describes Comrade Stalin's great contributions to the theoretical and practical resolution of the national question. The article states that in the Soviet Union, great friendship unites more than sixty large and small nationalities and races. The foundation of this great friendship is Comrade Stalin's doctrine. The working class, which declares the equality of all nations, is primarily concerned with truly guaranteeing national equality materially and economically, and Stalin is the standard-bearer of this idea. The article goes on to point out that Comrade Stalin is a great fighter for the friendship of all peoples in the world. Comrade Stalin has made great contributions to consolidating the great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. There is no doubt that Stalin's idea of the friendship of all peoples will completely defeat the predatory ideas of the imperialist warmongers.

Secchia's article was written on the occasion of the sixtieth birthday (March 26) of Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party. This article describes Comrade Togliatti's contributions to the Italian and international communist and democratic movements since the end of the First World War. Secchia said: The achievements of the Italian Communist Party should be attributed, first and foremost, to Comrade Togliatti's political and organizational work. He has transformed the Italian Communist Party into a force capable of advancing under the banner of freedom, peace, and national independence, and into a force capable of giving the Italian people a bright future.

This issue also contains "The Struggle of Syrian and Lebanese Peasants for Peace, National Independence, and Land" by I. Ennamri. The article points out that this peasant struggle is inextricably linked to the struggle of the Syrian and Lebanese working class and all the people against imperialist rule. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十三期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十三期已在十一日出版。
    本期发表了题为“自由人民之间牢不可破的伟大友谊”的社论。社论指出：在以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营各国之间，已经形成了一种崭新的关系，它充满着无产阶级国际主义的精神。苏联巨大规模的和平建设，中华人民共和国所获得的成就，以及欧洲人民民主国家所获得的成就，被全体进步人类看作对于争取世界和平、巩固国际友谊的事业的伟大贡献。社论接着说：社会主义阵营的各国人民警惕地保卫着人民政权的成果，随时准备无情地惩罚一切胆敢侵犯和危害他们的自由和独立的人。世界上没有任何力量能够削弱各国自由人民的友谊和联盟。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记约·基辛涅夫斯基的“列宁和斯大林论新型的政党”，匈牙利劳动人民党政治局委员约·里瓦伊的“各国人民友好——伟大和无敌的思想”，意大利共产党副总书记彼·谢嘉的“帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂——意大利共产党人和劳动人民的领袖”。
    基辛涅夫斯基的文章概述了列宁和斯大林同志关于建立新型工人阶级政党的基本原则和指示，并指出斯大林同志的最大历史性贡献之一，就是他在和托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子及其他叛徒的斗争中，捍卫住了并且天才地发展了列宁关于党的学说，以对于世界共产主义运动具有重大意义的论点丰富了关于党的学说。这些论点包括：精通并创造性地运用马克思主义，对各种机会主义者进行坚决的斗争，加强批评和自我批评，经常巩固党和群众的密切联系等。列宁和斯大林关于党的学说是各国共产党和工人党的行动的指南，是争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争获得胜利的坚固基础。今天，在伟大的斯大林已经和我们永别了的时候，马克思列宁主义的旗帜是由经过考验的领导机构领导着的苏联共产党打着前进的。苏联共产党是所有共产党和工人党的模范，各国共产党和工人党对苏联共产党及其列宁—斯大林式的领导机构表示无限的感激和忠诚，无产阶级国际主义的红旗将把国际工人阶级更坚固地团结在列宁—斯大林党的周围。
    里瓦伊的文章叙述了斯大林同志从理论上到实践上在解决民族问题方面的巨大贡献。文章说，在苏联，伟大的友谊团结了六十多个大小民族和种族。这种伟大友谊的基础就是斯大林同志的学说。宣布各民族一律平等的工人阶级，首先关心的就是真正在物质上和经济上保障民族平等，斯大林就是这种思想的旗手。文章接着指出，斯大林同志是全世界各国人民友好的伟大战士。斯大林同志在巩固苏联和中国人民的伟大友谊上做出了巨大的贡献。毫无疑问，斯大林的各国人民友好的思想将完全战胜帝国主义战争贩子的掠夺思想。
    谢嘉的文章是他在意大利共产党总书记帕·陶里亚蒂六十寿辰（三月二十六日）的时候写的。这篇文章叙述了陶里亚蒂同志从第一次世界大战结束以来对意大利的和国际的共产主义和民主运动的贡献。谢嘉说：意大利共产党的成就，首先而且在很大程度上，应该归功于陶里亚蒂同志的政治工作和组织工作。他使意大利共产党变成了一支能够打着自由、和平与民族独立的旗帜前进的力量，变成了一支能够给意大利人民以美好将来的力量。
    本期还刊载了伊·恩纳姆里所作的“叙利亚和黎巴嫩农民争取和平、民族独立和土地的斗争”。文章指出，这个农民斗争是与叙利亚和黎巴嫩工人阶级及全体人民反对帝国主义统治的斗争不可分地联系着的。（新华社）
