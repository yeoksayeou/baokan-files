Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: According to a report from Panmunjom by Pierre Courtade, a reporter for the Parisian newspaper L'Humanité, on April 11th:

    This morning, before the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, the US propaganda chiefs once again imposed completely unwarranted restrictions on journalists. This is a consistent tactic they have employed since the start of the armistice negotiations, a tactic made even more apparent by the recent "interruption" of journalist communications between Munsan and Tokyo, and the completely distorted press releases.

    In order to cover the news of the agreement signing, the Korean and Chinese side suggested that all journalists, photographers, newsreel cameramen, and radio recording personnel from both sides should attend. Daniel opposed this suggestion, saying that he would only allow one official photographer from each side to attend, and that other journalists would not be allowed. The United Nations Command journalists had already been notified of the restrictions, and they themselves selected four journalists, each representing a news organization. After discussion, the Korean and Chinese side suggested that four journalists attend, but Daniel insisted that no journalists be allowed to attend the agreement signing ceremony. In the end, he agreed to allow two official photographers to attend. Daniel personally directed the US Navy photographer as to what kind of photos to take. In the end, the indignant American journalists who had been manipulated were all waiting for the Navy Rear Admiral to come out of the conference tent. They all demanded that he explain, but he couldn't answer a single question.

    The eyes of the world are now focused on the US side to see whether they are prepared to support their rhetoric of peace with actions that will lead to peace. All peace-loving humanity is eagerly awaiting their response in the coming days to the many concrete actions of the Korean and Chinese side. If they truly desire peace and not deliberate delays, then negotiations can begin immediately, and peace can be achieved quickly.

    巴黎人道报记者贝却敌揭露美方限制采访协定签字的记者活动
    【新华社十一日讯】据巴黎人道报记者贝却敌十一日自板门店报道：
    今天上午，在遣返病伤战俘的协定上签字以前，美方的宣传首脑又对记者们加以完全不正当的限制。这是停战谈判开始以后他们一贯玩弄的一套花样，最近汶山与东京间的记者通讯联络的“中断”以及完全歪曲的新闻发布更使得这种花样显得明显。
    为了采访协定签字的消息，朝中方面建议双方所有的记者、摄影师、新闻纪录片摄影记者以及无线电录音人员都前往参加。丹尼尔反对这个建议，他说他只愿意每方有一个官方的摄影师前往，其他新闻人员不得参加。联合国军的记者们已经得到通知说要有限制，他们自己就选出了四个记者，每一个记者代表一个新闻机关。经过讨论以后，朝中方面建议四个记者参加，但是丹尼尔坚持不准任何记者参加协定签字的仪式。最后他同意由两个官方的摄影师参加。丹尼尔亲自指导美国海军摄影师拍摄什么样的照片。到最后受了玩弄的愤慨的美国记者们都在等待着这位海军少将从会议帐篷里出来。他们纷纷要求他解释，但是他一句也回答不出。
    究竟美方是否准备用足以导向和平的行动来支持他们和平的言论，全世界的目光现在都集中在美方身上。整个爱好和平的人类都在殷切地盼望他们能在今后几天内回答朝中方面的许多具体行动。假若他们果真希望和平而不是故意拖延时间，那么谈判就可以立刻开始，和平也就可以很快地实现。
