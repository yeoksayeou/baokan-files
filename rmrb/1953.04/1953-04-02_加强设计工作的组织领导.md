Strengthen the Organizational Leadership of Design Work

Currently, the most prominent problems in capital construction are the significant backwardness of design work and the poor quality of designs. Due to the backwardness of design work, most capital construction projects this year cannot start on time, resulting in a large amount of idle work. Some projects will be forced to be postponed, and some will even have to be cut from this year's capital construction plan. Due to the poor quality of designs, some designs have to be reworked after careful review; other designs, even if they pass, may still reveal many shortcomings during construction, even causing rework and shutdowns. This also causes some newly built factories to remain in an unreasonable state for a long time during future production. The current state of design work is seriously affecting the progress of the national construction plan.

The backwardness of design work is objectively due to the fact that China has never undertaken such large-scale economic construction as it is today. The industrial base of old China was very weak, resulting in a small technical force and a low level of technology. However, on the other hand, some departments have not paid enough attention to the concentration of design forces, have a mentality of relying on foreign designs, and lack specific leadership over design work. For example, after the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee held a basic construction meeting last year, many departments paid attention to concentrating design forces in a timely manner. Now, the number of design personnel concentrated nationwide has reached more than 16,000. However, many units still ignore this work. For example, the Second Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry only has dozens of civil engineering and construction designers, and has not concentrated the "factory design" force. Therefore, the current growth of design forces is far from keeping up with the needs of the work. As for how to properly use the existing forces, give full play to the role of design personnel, and continuously improve their political and technical levels, most departments have not done enough work in this regard, with the exception of a few. Due to the lack of organizational leadership over design work, the following situations have arisen: some departments have not conducted timely criticism and education of various erroneous ideas of design personnel; many units do not understand the actual design progress and the current problems in design work; design personnel still experience a large amount of idle work; and design efficiency is very low. Therefore, design work is even more backward in basic construction, and this situation must be changed.

In order to better carry out the basic construction work in the first year of the country's large-scale economic construction, it is now necessary to strengthen the leadership of design work and carry out the following four tasks:

First, check the implementation of the design progress plan and revise the design progress plan accordingly. The design progress plans of various departments this year were compiled without sufficient design experience, and their accuracy varies. The practice of the past three months has proven that many designs cannot be completed according to the plan. Therefore, it is necessary to specifically study and analyze the reasons and experiences for completing and not completing the progress plan based on the actual design progress of the past three months, and revise the progress plan on the condition of improving the political awareness of technical personnel and giving full play to the potential forces of design work. Projects that cannot be designed due to lack of strength, lack of information, or immature technical conditions should be postponed or cut from this year's plan. In revising the design progress plan, it is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondary, focus on major construction projects, and put the main design forces on major construction projects. After this work is carried out, the construction departments can arrange construction projects and construction forces according to the revised design progress plan. Projects that cannot be constructed this year due to design delays should not be assigned construction forces. For some projects, standard designs should be fully utilized to avoid greater idleness and waste. Without checking the design progress plan, construction forces cannot be arranged. This work should be carried out by all design personnel, and all views that do not value the design progress plan are wrong.

Second, create conditions for the normal progress of design work. Some problems that currently hinder the normal progress of design work should be resolved in a timely manner. First of all, the task books of many design projects have not yet determined the product plan and construction scale, so design cannot be started, and designers have nothing to do. In addition, the product plans of some design projects have been repeatedly changed due to insufficient consideration, causing design rework and wasting design forces. Therefore, leading cadres, planning departments, and design departments of various ministries are required to conduct a comprehensive and careful study of the product plan and construction scale immediately, and should not be hasty or delay and accumulate without processing. Secondly, strengthen review and approval work and shorten the review and approval time as much as possible. Currently, the review and approval of task books, preliminary designs, and technical designs is very slow. It often takes more than a month from the designer's completion of the manuscript to the submission to the ministry, and more than a month for the approval to be sent down. Some ministries even hold it for two or three months without approving it, so designers have to stop work. These are important reasons why designs cannot be supplied in a timely manner.

Third, scientifically organize the work of design personnel. Currently, the design efficiency of design personnel is not high, mainly because the work of design personnel has not yet been organized in design work in the same way as production is organized. Production departments already have various experiences in organizing rhythmic production, and construction departments also have construction experiences such as parallel pipeline operations, while design departments have just begun to explore and have not yet created advanced operating experiences of design work itself. Therefore, the potential forces of design departments have not yet been fully utilized. Therefore, it is necessary to study the organization and division of labor of design work, study the establishment of various systems, especially the design quality inspection system, responsibility system, etc. Only by establishing these systems can the normal progress of design work be guaranteed, and the quality and efficiency of design can be continuously improved. Since we still lack experience in this regard, we should promptly summarize the advanced experiences of design departments and promote them.

Fourth, begin some fundamental construction work in the design department. The first is to improve the ideological and technical level of design personnel. Some departments have already started this work, and other departments should carry out this important work among all design personnel. Based on specific examples, criticize various erroneous design ideas and erroneous attitudes towards design. This is an important ideological education work. Secondly, since our design departments are newly established, all basic data is very lacking, especially various design standards and technical data (including various quotas, etc.). We should collect and sort them out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and gradually accumulate them. This is an extremely important construction work of the design department, which must be carried out in a planned manner and as early as possible, so as to gradually lay the foundation for the improvement of future design work.

This year's design tasks are heavy, and next year's design tasks will be even heavier. We must strive to fundamentally change the backward state of design work through this year's efforts, striving to do so next year or the year after. We must plan to cultivate the design organization into a powerful force capable of undertaking huge construction tasks. This is a major and arduous task of great significance for large-scale economic construction.

    加强设计工作的组织领导
    目前基本建设中最突出的问题是设计工作十分落后和设计质量低劣。由于设计工作的落后，今年大部分基本建设工程都不能及时开工，造成了大量窝工的现象，一部分工程将被迫推迟，有的还将要从今年基本建设计划中削去。由于设计质量的低劣，一部分设计经过认真审查以后还要返工；另外一些设计，即使通过了，在施工中还可能发现很多缺点，甚至造成返工、停工的现象，或者使一些新建的工厂，在将来生产中长期处于不合理的状态。设计工作的这种情况，正在严重地影响着国家建设计划的进程。
    设计工作之所以落后，客观上是由于我国从来没有像今天这样进行过大规模经济建设，旧中国的工业基础十分薄弱，因而技术力量小，技术水平低。但是另一方面，也由于有些部门对于设计力量的集结缺乏足够的重视，存在着依赖国外设计的思想，和缺乏对设计工作的具体领导。例如在去年政务院财政经济委员会基本建设会议以后，很多部门都注意了及时地将设计力量集中使用，现在全国集中的设计人员已达一万六千多名，但是也有不少单位仍然忽视这一工作，如第二机械工业部第二局，至今只有几十名土木建筑设计人员，而没有把“工厂设计”力量集中起来，因此目前设计力量的增长就远赶不上工作的需要。至于如何把已有的力量恰当地使用，充分发挥设计人员的作用，并不断提高他们的政治和技术水平，在这方面，除个别部门外，多数部门的工作还做得不够好。由于对设计工作缺乏组织领导，便产生了下列情况：有些部门对于设计人员的各种错误思想，没有进行及时的批判和教育；不少单位不了解实际的设计进度和设计工作中目前存在的问题；设计人员仍然发生大量窝工的现象；设计效率很低。因此设计工作在基本建设中就更显得落后，这种情况是必须改变的。
    为了使国家大规模经济建设的第一年的基本建设工作进行得更好，目前必须加强对于设计工作的领导，并进行以下四项工作：
    第一，检查设计进度计划执行的情况，并据以修改设计进度计划。各部门今年的设计进度计划是在缺乏设计经验的情况下编制的，其准确程度不一，三个月来的实践已证明有许多设计不能按计划完成，因此必须具体地根据三个月来的实际设计进度，研究、分析其完成和没有完成进度计划的原因和经验，在提高技术人员的政治觉悟程度和充分发挥设计工作潜在力量的条件下修改一次进度计划，把没有力量设计和缺乏资料以及技术条件尚未成熟，不能开始设计的项目，推迟或从今年的计划中削减去。在修改设计进度计划中，必须分清主次，抓紧主要工程项目，把主要的设计力量放在主要工程项目上去。在进行了这一工作以后，施工部门即可根据修改后的设计进度计划，安排施工项目和施工力量。因为设计推迟而今年不能施工的项目，就不应该安排施工力量，有些项目则应充分利用标准设计，以免造成更大的窝工浪费。不检查设计进度计划，施工力量是无法安排的。这一工作要发动全体设计人员来进行，一切不重视设计进度计划的观点都是错误的。
    第二，为设计工作的正常进行创造条件。目前有些妨碍设计工作正常进行的问题，应适时加以解决。首先是不少设计项目的计划任务书，尚未将产品方案和建设规模问题加以确定，因而无法开始设计，设计人员没有事干；还有一些设计项目的产品方案由于考虑不周，再三变动，造成设计返工，浪费了设计力量。因此要求各部领导干部、计划部门和设计部门，即时地对产品方案和建设规模加以全面的慎重的研究，既不能草率，又不要拖延积压不作处理。其次是加强审核批准工作，尽量缩短审核批准的时间。目前计划任务书、初步设计、技术设计的审核批准非常迟缓，往往从设计人员脱稿到送部时间相隔一个多月，批下去又是一个多月，有的部甚至压了两、三个月还批不下去，因此设计人员只好停工。这些都是设计不能及时供应的重要原因。
    第三，科学地组织设计人员的工作。目前设计人员的设计效率不高，主要的是由于还没有开始在设计工作中像组织生产一样的组织设计人员的工作。在生产部门已经有各种组织有节奏生产的经验，在施工部门也有像平行流水作业的施工经验，而在设计部门工作刚开始摸索，还没有创造出设计工作本身的先进的作业经验，因而设计部门潜在力量还未能充分发挥。因此必须研究设计工作的组织和分工，研究建立各种制度，特别是设计质量的检查制度，责任制度等等。只有建立了这些制度才能保证设计工作的正常进行，才能不断地提高设计的质量和设计的效率。由于在这方面我们还缺乏经验，应及时总结设计部门的先进经验加以推广。
    第四，着手进行设计部门的一些根本性的建设工作。首先是提高设计人员的思想水平和技术水平，这一工作有些部门已经展开，其他部门都应该在全体设计人员中进行这一项重要工作，根据具体的实例批判各种错误的设计思想和对待设计的错误态度，这是一项重要的思想教育工作。其次由于我们设计部门都是新建立的，一切基本资料都很缺乏，特别是各种设计标准和技术资料（包括各种定额等等），应有计划有步骤地汇集整理，逐步积累，这是设计部门极其重要的建设工作，必须有计划地及早进行，为将来设计工作的提高，逐步打下基础。
    今年的设计任务是繁重的，明年的设计任务将更加繁重，我们必须经过今年的努力，争取明年或者后年基本上改变设计工作的这种落后状态。我们必须有计划地把设计机构培养成为能够担当巨大建设任务的强大力量。这是一项对大规模经济建设有重大意义而又是艰巨的工作。
