Xinhua News Agency, Rome, April 19th: The Italian Communist Party National Congress opened in Rome on April 15th, according to TASS.

    The congress heard a report by the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, on the "Program of the Communist Party in the Parliamentary Elections."

    Togliatti first stated that, from a legal point of view, the new electoral law cannot be considered valid. The lawless actions taken when this electoral law was passed in the Italian parliament are enough to cast doubt on the legality of the election itself.

    Speaking of the Italian Communist Party's tasks in the election campaign, Togliatti emphasized: "We call on the Italian people to express their attitude in the upcoming elections, so that Italy can produce a government willing to unite with forces that are striving to ease tensions and strive for world peace."

    Togliatti exposed the policy pursued by the current Italian government of turning Italy into a police state. Togliatti said: "Italy needs a new path. It needs to implement the social reforms stipulated in the constitution."

    Togliatti concluded his report by calling on the Italian people to deprive the Christian Democratic Party and its Social Democratic and Liberal Party followers of their majority in parliament.

    意大利共产党全国代表大会在罗马开幕
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党全国代表大会于四月十五日在罗马开幕。
    大会听取了意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂关于“共产党在议会选举中的纲领”的报告。
    陶里亚蒂首先说，从法理的观点看，新选举法是不能认为有效的。在意大利议会通过这个选举法时所做出的那些无法无天的行动，即足以叫人怀疑选举本身的合法性。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到意大利共产党在竞选运动中的任务时着重说：“我们号召意大利人民在即将到来的选举中表明他们的态度，使意大利能产生一个愿意和正在争取缓和紧张局势并争取世界和平的力量团结起来的政府。”
    陶里亚蒂揭露了意大利现政府所奉行的把意大利变成一个警察国家的政策。陶里亚蒂说：“意大利需要一条新的道路。它需要实施宪法所规定的社会改革。”
    陶里亚蒂在他的报告中最后号召意大利人民剥夺天主教民主党及其社会民主党与自由党的随从在议会中的多数。
