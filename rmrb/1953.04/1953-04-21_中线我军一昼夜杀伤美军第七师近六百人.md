Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 19th: On the central Korean front, the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a powerful attack on enemy positions northwest and northeast of Lianchuan on the night of the 16th. In one day and night, they inflicted nearly 600 casualties on the US 7th Division and drove the enemy from two positions.

On the night of the 16th, our forces launched an attack on the US troops entrenched on North Mountain of Shixian Cave, annihilating most of two platoons of the enemy's 7th Division. After our army captured this position, the enemy dared not come to contend for it that night. On the morning of the 17th, the enemy dispatched more than one battalion, with the support of five tanks, to counterattack our army. Our army fought back tenaciously with artillery support, repelling five enemy assaults in succession and annihilating more than 400 soldiers of the US 7th Division.

The other two enemy positions captured by our army were one near Deyin Cave. This position was also held by the US 7th Division. In this position, our army wiped out an entire reinforced platoon of the defending enemy in one fell swoop. Afterwards, the enemy launched four counterattacks with forces ranging from two platoons to one company, all of which were repulsed by our army. Before dawn, our army took the initiative to withdraw from this position after annihilating more than 150 enemies. The other position was near Gexianli. Our army completely annihilated two squads of the defending enemy at this position.

On the 16th and 17th, there were only small troop activities in other areas of the front, and some ambushes and skirmishes occurred.

    中线我军一昼夜杀伤美军第七师近六百人
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】朝鲜中线中国人民志愿军在十六日夜间向涟川西北及东北的敌军阵地进行强有力的袭击，一昼夜间，杀伤美军第七师近六百人，并赶跑了两个阵地上的敌军。
    十六日夜间，我军向据守在石岘洞北山上的美军发起袭击，歼灭守敌美军第七师两个排的大部。这个阵地被我军攻占后，当夜敌人未敢前来争夺。十七日早晨，敌人才派遣一个多营的兵力，在五辆坦克的配合下向我军进行反扑。我军在炮火配合下顽强抗击，连续打退了敌人五次冲锋，共计歼灭美军第七师四百多人。
    被我军攻占的另外两个敌军阵地，一个在德隐洞附近。这个阵地也是美军第七师据守的。在这个阵地上，我军一举全歼守敌一个加强排。以后敌人又以两个排到一个连的兵力连续进行四次反扑，都被我军击退。天明之前，我军在歼敌一百五十多名后主动撤出了这个阵地。另一个阵地在葛岘里附近。我军在这一个阵地上全歼守敌两个班。
    在十六日和十七日两天中，前线其他地区只有小部队活动，发生了一些伏击战和遭遇战。
