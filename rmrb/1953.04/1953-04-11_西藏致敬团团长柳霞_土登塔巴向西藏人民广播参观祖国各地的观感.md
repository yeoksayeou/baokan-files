Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba, the leader of the Tibetan Delegation of Homage, broadcast in Tibetan from the Central People's Broadcasting Station on April 6th and 7th to Tibetan monks, officials, and the masses about the impressions the delegation gained from visiting the interior of the motherland over the past three months. Using facts he saw with his own eyes, he explained the great achievements of the motherland in political, economic, and cultural construction over the past three years and the happy lives of the people throughout the country. He also introduced the correct implementation of the policy of national equality and the policy of freedom of religious belief in various places.

Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba first recounted their visit to the Hulunbuir League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He said, "Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the eleven ethnic groups in this region have been practicing national regional autonomy since 1947, fully enjoying the right to be masters of their own affairs and starting a happy life. Ethnic groups and individuals within each ethnic group help and love each other like brothers. Their lives have improved. Before liberation, there were only 500,000 livestock here; now, it has increased to 1.48 million, an average of 63 per person. Agricultural products have increased by 117 percent. There has also been great progress in culture. In a remote pastoral area of the Hailar region, there is a six-year primary school with more than 600 students. Most areas have established spare-time schools and literacy classes for working people who were previously unable to attend school, and larger banners also have kindergartens. Mobile medical teams constantly go to remote pastoral areas to treat diseases for people of all ethnic groups, and venereal disease stations have been established to eradicate syphilis. Now, the population has greatly increased."

When talking about the religious situation in Inner Mongolia, Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba said, "There are 21 Buddhist temples in the Hulunbuir League area, with more than 1,500 monks. In the past, Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries stationed troops in the temples, destroying and looting them, and grabbing young monks to serve as soldiers. However, after liberation, a policy of protecting religion was implemented, and the temples gradually recovered. When we went to temples such as Ganzhu Temple and Tongbao Temple to pay our respects, we saw the prosperous lives of the monks. The living Buddhas and monks' devotion to Buddhism has not changed at all. When we presented them with the Buddha statues of the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, they kowtowed and prayed devoutly." He continued, "In short, the monks and laypeople of Inner Mongolia have equal political rights, the economy has prospered, cultural education has developed well, and the unity within the ethnic groups has been consolidated. Brilliant achievements have been made in all aspects. This has been achieved entirely under the correct leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, which makes us deeply realize that the entire Tibetan people must wholeheartedly and unswervingly support Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party and follow the path of Inner Mongolia."

Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba specifically reported on their visits to major cities in Northeast, North, and East China, the construction situation, and the happy lives of the people. He said, "In the past few years since liberation, cities in Northeast China such as Harbin, Lushun, and Dalian have seen great development in politics, economy, and culture, especially in industry. For example, the Harbin Flax Factory is large in scale and operates entirely with automated machines. The quality and quantity of its products are very high. Heavy industry in Northeast China is very developed and can manufacture many kinds of the most complex machines, which can be used to open many new factories. In the past, we Tibetans were deceived by imperialist propaganda and believed that machines were all foreign products. After this visit, our understanding has fundamentally changed. In the Dalian Shipyard, we personally saw the machines and hulls inside various ships being manufactured or repaired. In the train factory, we saw locomotives and trains being manufactured. The machinery manufacturing plants in Dalian and Shenyang can manufacture various machine tools, which can then manufacture various different machines. We saw these with our own eyes and felt a surprise and excitement that could not be expressed in words. At the same time, we also saw various concrete facts of Soviet experts helping our country with internationalist spirit." He pointed out that although Northeast China is located on the northeastern frontier of our country, the high level of development of industry and agriculture in Northeast China is a favorable condition for the national economic development, and it will also be a powerful help for the development of various ethnic minority areas, including the Tibetan people who are thousands of miles away.

Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba said, "In the past, we heard rumors that 'the Communist Party confiscated private capital.' Private capital in Northeast China has not only not been confiscated but has been restored and developed with the help of the Communist Party. The same is true for cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai. For example, before liberation, the Renli Woolen Mill in Tianjin could only weave serge; now, it can also weave blankets and carpets, making a large profit every year. Before liberation, the Shanghai Golden Star Fountain Pen Factory could only produce more than 2,400 dozens of pens per month; now, it can produce more than 6,700 dozens, and they are also sold abroad. The spindles of the Wuxi Shenxin Textile Factory have also increased from 70,000 before liberation to 100,000. At the same time, private capitalists have also gained a higher status and rights in politics than before liberation. These obvious facts expose all destructive rumors."

Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba then reported on the prosperity he saw in cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. He said: Shanghai has a population of six million, and the working people are taken care of not only in clothing and food but also in housing, medical care, culture, and education. Everyone has a job. We visited for seven days and saw no beggars, thieves, hooligans, or prostitutes. Not only does no one steal things on the streets, but if you lose something on the bus, someone will return it. All public and private stores, large and small, have fair prices and no fraudulent practices. There are many beautiful parks in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places, and our ethnic minorities can visit these places freely.

After introducing the situation of the Huai River Harnessing Project, Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba excitedly talked about his impressions in the Northwest region. He said, "This region is developing like other places after liberation. The railway from Xi'an to Lanzhou has been built very well. It passes through the famous Qinling Mountains and has more than 130 tunnels. The train travels quickly back and forth in the mountains and ridges. Judging from such a huge project, a railway can also be built in Tibet." He emphatically reported on the religious situation in the Northwest region. He said, "The most memorable thing is that we went to the Buddhist holy land, Ta'er Monastery, to worship Buddha, light lamps, visit monks, and give them alms. The monasteries in the Amdo region, led by Ta'er Monastery and Labrang Tashilhunpo Monastery, had greatly declined under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, the land of each temple was not divided during the land reform, and the Living Buddhas were also respected. The government does not interfere in the internal affairs of the temples and provides assistance. The Northwest region has had close ties with Tibet in history, both religiously and politically, and it is a great honor to be able to go there. This is the grace given to us by Chairman Mao."

Liu Xia·Tudeng Tabba finally said, "After making a very detailed visit and investigation throughout the country, we came to the conclusion that only the close unity of the people of all ethnic groups can make our country even more consolidated and prosperous. The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have implemented the policies of national equality, religious freedom, and respect for the customs and habits of the people of all ethnic groups, thus enabling the people of the whole country to truly achieve seamless unity." He pointed out, "We, the fraternal ethnic groups, must strive to move forward on the bright road guided by Chairman Mao. In order to catch up with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is already ahead of us, the Tibetan people must follow the correct path that the Inner Mongolian people have already taken and learn from the fraternal ethnic groups in the Northwest and Southwest, correctly implementing national regional autonomy. In economic construction, we will obtain the help of Northeast China in machinery and equipment and advanced technology, as well as the support of East China and North China. With the enthusiastic and selfless help of the Han workers and peasants, the Tibetan people will unite to build a new Tibet and firmly defend our border."

    西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴向西藏人民广播参观祖国各地的观感
    西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴已于四月六、七两日在中央人民广播电台用藏语向西藏僧俗官员和群众广播西藏致敬团三个月来参观祖国内地的观感。他用亲眼看到的事实，说明祖国三年来在政治、经济、文化各方面建设的伟大成就和全国人民的幸福生活，并介绍了各地正确实施民族平等政策和宗教信仰自由政策的情形。
    柳霞·土登塔巴首先讲述他们参观内蒙古自治区呼纳盟的情形。他说：“这个地区的十一个民族人民在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党领导下，自一九四七年就实行了民族区域自治，充分享受到当家做主的权利，开始了幸福的生活，民族内部及各民族间就像亲兄弟一般的互助友爱。他们的生活改善了，解放前这里只有五十万只牲畜，现在增加到一百四十八万只，平均每人六十三只；农产品增加了百分之一百一十七。文化方面也有很大进步，在海拉尔地区一个偏僻的牧区里，就设有六年制的小学校，有六百多个学生；大部地区都为以前失学的劳动人民建立了业余学校和补习班，比较大的旗还有幼儿园；巡回医疗队不断地到边远牧区为各族人民医治疾病，并且设立驱梅站根治梅毒，现在人口大大地增加起来了。”
    柳霞·土登塔巴在讲到内蒙古地区的宗教情形时说：“呼纳盟地区有二十一个佛教寺院，僧人一千五百多人。从前日本帝国主义及国民党反动派在寺院里驻扎军队，破坏和抢夺，并抓青年僧人去当兵。但是在解放后实行了保护宗教的政策，寺院渐渐恢复了，我们到甘珠寺、同保寺等寺院去朝拜时，看到了僧人们的富裕生活。活佛、僧众对佛教的虔诚丝毫未变，当我们将达赖和班禅两位活佛的佛像赠给他们时，他们叩头顶礼，虔诚的祈祷。”他接着说：“总之，内蒙古僧俗人民都有平等的政治权利，经济繁荣起来了，文化教育有很好的发展，民族内部也巩固地团结起来，各方面获得了辉煌的成就，这完全是在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下达到的，使我们深刻认识到：全西藏人民必须一心一意，毫不动摇地拥护毛主席和中国共产党，要走内蒙古的道路。”
    柳霞·土登塔巴具体地报告了他们参观东北、华北、华东地区各大城市的建设情形和人民的幸福生活。他说：“东北的哈尔滨、旅顺、大连等城市，解放后的几年间，政治、经济、文化的发展很大，特别是工业有高度的发展。如哈尔滨的亚麻厂规模宏大，全部用自动化机器操作，产品质量和数量都很高。东北的重工业非常发达，能够制造许多种最复杂的机器，用这些机器又可以开设许多新的工厂。从前我们西藏人受了帝国主义的宣传欺骗，认为机器都是外国产品，经过这次参观根本上改变了我们的认识。我们在大连造船厂里，亲眼看到正在制造或修理各种轮船内部的机器和船身，在火车制造厂里我们看到正在制造的机车和列车；大连和沈阳的机械制造厂可以制造各种母机，这些母机又可以制造各种不同的机器。我们亲眼看到了这些，感到不能用言语形容的惊奇和兴奋。同时我们还看到苏联专家们以国际主义精神帮助我国建设的各种具体事实。”他指出：东北虽处于我国东北的边疆，但东北工业和农业高度的发展，对于全国经济发展是一个有利的条件，对于各少数民族地区的发展也会成为有力的帮助，对于远隔万里以外的西藏人民也是这样。
    柳霞·土登塔巴说：“过去我们听到‘共产党没收私人资本’的谣言。东北的私人资本不但没有被没收，反而在共产党的帮助下恢复和发展了，天津、上海等城市也是这样。例如天津仁立毛织厂解放前只能织哔叽，现在还可以织毛毯和地毡，每年盈利很大；上海金星自来水笔工厂解放前每月只能生产两千四百多打钢笔，现在能出产六千七百多打，而且还销到国外去；无锡申新纺织厂的纺锭也由解放前的七万个发展到十万个。同时在政治上，私人资本家也获得了比解放前更高的地位和权利。这些彰明昭著的事实，揭穿了一切破坏谣言。”
    柳霞·土登塔巴接着报告了他们在上海、南京、杭州等城市所看到的繁荣景象。他说：上海市有六百万人口，劳动人民不但在衣食上而且在居住、医药卫生、文化教育等方面都得到了照顾，每人都有工作。我们参观了七天，看不见乞丐、小偷、流氓和妓女，大街上不但没有人偷东西，在汽车上遗失了东西都会有人送回来。公私大小商店都是价钱公道，没有欺骗妄取的现象。在南京、杭州等地有许多美丽公园，我们少数民族都可以到这些地方自由地游览。
    柳霞·土登塔巴在介绍了修治淮河工程的情况后，又兴奋地讲述在西北地区的观感。他说：“这个区域解放后也像其他地方一样在发展着。西安到兰州的铁路已经修得很好了，它通过著名的秦岭山脉，共有一百三十多个山洞，火车在万山丛岭中迅速来往。从这样巨大的工程看来，西藏也能修好铁路的。”他着重地报告了西北地区宗教方面的情况。他说：“最值得纪念的是我们曾到佛教圣地塔尔寺拜佛点灯、访问僧众并给他们布施。以塔尔寺和拉卜楞札希肯寺为首的安多地区的寺院，过去在国民党反动派的统治下大大衰落了，解放后，各寺的田地在土地改革时都没有分，活佛也都受到尊敬，寺庙的内部事务，政府不予干涉，而且得到帮助。西北地区在历史上不论宗教和政治方面，与西藏都有密切的关系，能够到那里去是非常荣幸的，这是毛主席给我们的恩惠。”
    柳霞·土登塔巴最后说：“我们在全国各地作了极详细的参观和调查之后得到这样一个结论：就是只有各民族人民的亲密团结才能使我国越加巩固和富强。中国共产党和毛主席实行了民族平等、宗教自由、尊重各民族人民风俗习惯的政策，因此使全国人民真正达到了团结无间。”他指出：“我们各兄弟民族必须努力向毛主席指引的光明道路前进。为了迎头赶上已经走在我们前面的内蒙古自治区，我们西藏人民一定遵循内蒙古人民已经走过的正确道路，并学习西北、西南各兄弟民族，正确地实行民族区域自治；在经济建设中我们将要取得东北在机器设备和先进技术的帮助及华东、华北等地的支援。在汉族工农人民热诚无私的帮助下，西藏人民团结起来，建设新西藏，坚固地保卫我国的边疆。”
