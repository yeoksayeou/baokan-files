    Datong County cadres, in the process of supplying fertilizer to the masses this spring, adopted a simplistic and coercive commandist approach from top to bottom, resulting in serious adverse consequences. The county's supply and marketing cooperative lacked thorough investigation and understanding of the fertilizer supply work this year. At an expanded meeting of cadres at the county, district, and village levels held in early March, they subjectively and arbitrarily allocated 1.26 million jin of soybean cake, 1.55 million jin of sesame cake, and 60,000 jin of fertilizer powder to various districts. The districts, in turn, allocated them to the villages in the same manner and launched challenges, turning the challenges into a form of coercion to complete the tasks. For example, the conditions for the challenge from the Shuibo Temple village cadres to the Shijiazhai included: if the task is not completed, they are willing to sew a red flag and have the entire village perform Yangko dance to send the flag to Shijiazhai. Other villages also blindly challenged and responded to challenges without considering the actual situation and the needs of the masses. As a result, village cadres, after returning to their villages, adopted coercive allocation and apportionment methods. Cadres from Jijiazhuang, Qincheng, Hongcibao, Hujiayao, and other villages, because the amount of fertilizer reported by the masses themselves was not enough to complete the "task," apportioned the task according to the acreage of land each family was responsible for. Zhao Shengkui, the village chief of Shuitou Village, forced the masses to buy fertilizer. He said at the meeting: "The county has given orders to the district, and the district has asked our village to complete the task of 10,000 jin of fertilizer. You have to buy it, whether you want to or not. Anyway, we have to complete the task." The village cadres of Xihe River and San Shili Pu villages allowed the masses to "voluntarily report their purchases" at the meeting, and the meeting would not be adjourned if they did not volunteer. Many villages such as Taipingzhuang and Xietuan used the method of "comparing and forming teams" to get the masses to buy fertilizer. Families that were wealthy could not refuse to buy.

    As a result, a good thing was turned into a bad one, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. Wang Guan, a farmer in Niujiabao, was originally short of three months' worth of food this year, but village chief Wang Defu insisted that he sell his existing surplus grain to buy fertilizer, saying, "Complete the task temporarily, and we'll talk about it when there's nothing to eat in the future!" Some farmers in Hongcibao and Hujiayao who raise livestock, because they have no money or surplus grain to buy fertilizer, are preparing to sell the feed for their livestock and buy soybean cake to feed the livestock in order to "cope with the situation." Many villagers have reflected: the government often says not to allow cadres to have a coercive commandist work style, but here we are forced to buy fertilizer. What kind of work style is this! The county and district leading organs of Datong County should conduct inspections and corrections of the above situation, otherwise the spring plowing production movement will be seriously affected.

    大同县干部把好事办成坏事
    竟逼着群众买肥料
    大同县在春季供应群众肥料当中，自上而下地采取了简单从事的命令主义作法，形成了严重的恶果。该县供销合作社，对今年的肥料供应工作，事前缺乏深入的检查了解，在三月初召开的县、区、村三级扩大干部会议上，便主观臆断地把一百二十六万斤豆饼、一百五十五万斤麻饼、六万斤肥田粉分配给各区，区里又照样分派给各村，并发动挑战，把挑战成了一种强迫命令的方式，去完成任务。如水泊寺村干部向石家寨挑战的条件内有：如完不成任务，情愿缝红旗一面，由全村群众扭上秧歌把旗送到石家寨。其它村也都不是根据实际情况和群众的需要而盲目的挑战、应战。结果村干部回村后，便采取了强迫分配、摊派等做法。吉家庄、秦城、红赐堡、胡家窑等村的干部，因为群众自报购肥数字完不成“任务”，便按负担亩把任务摊开。水头村村长赵生奎强迫群众买肥料，他在会上说：“县给区下了命令，区里叫咱村完成一万斤肥料的任务，买也得买，不买也得买，反正得完成任务。”西河河与三十里铺的村干部，是在大会上让群众“自愿报买”，不自愿就不散会。太平庄、谢疃等不少村庄，则是用“评比站队”的办法让群众购买，谁家富裕不买就不行。
    这样做的结果，把好事办坏，引起了群众的极大不满。牛家堡农民王官本来今年还缺三个月的口粮，可是村长王德富非叫他粜了现有的余粮买肥料不行，并说：“暂时完成任务，将来没吃的再说！”红赐堡、胡家窑有一部分养牲口的农民，因没有钱和余粮买肥料，准备卖了耕畜的饲料，买成豆饼再喂耕畜以“应付差事”。很多村的群众都反映说：政府经常说不叫干部有强迫命令作风，可是咱们这里就强迫买肥料，这是啥作风！大同县的县、区领导机关，对以上情况应进行检查纠正，否则春耕生产运动将受到严重的影响。（赫永生）
