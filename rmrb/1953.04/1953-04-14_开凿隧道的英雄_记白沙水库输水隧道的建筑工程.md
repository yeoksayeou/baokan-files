The huge explosions roared and rumbled. As construction on the Baisha Reservoir project in the upper reaches of the Huai River began, the first task was to carve out a 346-meter-long water diversion tunnel to divert the river water from the reservoir area into a newly excavated channel. Otherwise, the other engineering work could not proceed. The explosions came from beneath a towering cliff. Then, as if an entire mountain was about to fall from the sky, huge rocks and endless sand and soil collapsed from the mountain. The river water in April flowed torrentially under the cliff, struck by the falling stones and sand, sending up splashes of water. Because the soil on the mountain was too loose, at first, the entrance to the water diversion tunnel was blocked by sand and rock that collapsed from the mountain as soon as it was blasted open. People had to dig with hoes, scooping out the sand and rock blocking the entrance, and then build wooden supports to hold up the rocks at the top of the tunnel while they continued to dig inward. But the stones and sand kept falling from the top of the tunnel. Inside the tunnel, in addition to the hard rock layers, were layers of sand and loose stones sandwiched between the rock layers.

Participating in the excavation of this tunnel were drillers, kiln workers, stonemasons, construction workers who plastered cement, built supports, and tied steel bars, as well as farmers selected from the ranks of the migrant workers. This was an arduous project, and it had to be completed in a hurry. The work went on day and night without stopping. After each huge explosion, these workers and farmers would run into the tunnel to inspect it, using iron hammers to knock down any unexploded stones, and build supports. After the migrant workers had pushed all the soil and stones out on light rails extending into the tunnel with dump trucks, the drillers would start the machines, drilling holes in the hard rock, installing explosives and fuses, followed by another earth-shattering explosion. They started digging from the inlet side, and after a month, work also began at the outlet on the south side of the inlet.

On the outlet side, there was a migrant worker team of 120 people, all farmers from Yuxian County, Henan Province, who had come to participate in the Huai River project. As soon as the explosion in the tunnel was over, they would run down the hillside and walk into the tunnel with the workers. At this time, one of them would say to everyone as they walked, "Comrades, let's go, wherever the workers go, we'll go..." This was the captain of the migrant worker team, Communist Party member Kang Zhilian. Everyone in the team knew him well: in his thirties, of medium height, he seemed to be a very tenacious, shrewd and capable man. If you wanted to know his background, people would tell you: like everyone else, he had suffered all kinds of bullying in the old society, but he was the kind of person who feared neither heaven nor earth.

Because his family was very poor, Kang Zhilian set up a cigarette stall on the street in Shundian Town, Yuxian County, when he was thirteen or fourteen years old. At fifteen or sixteen, he followed behind donkeys carrying coal for others. Later, he worked as a farmhand for landlords until after liberation, when he was finally freed from the shackles of the old society. Kang Zhilian got married when he was seventeen years old. When he was eighteen, his wife developed a malignant sore. Kang Zhilian hired a doctor in Shundian Town who claimed to be able to cure all kinds of poisonous sores and ulcers, and said he wouldn't charge if he couldn't cure it. But after taking several doses of some kind of medicine, his wife's sore didn't get any better. At that time, the swindlers and the yamen (local government office) were in cahoots. The doctor who claimed to be able to cure all kinds of poisonous sores and ulcers came with the Baozhang (local security chief) to demand money. One day, Kang Zhilian was eating breakfast at home, and he was worried because his wife's sore hadn't healed and the family was having financial difficulties. Kang Zhilian said, "The person hasn't been cured, why are you asking for money?" The Baozhang glared fiercely, stamped his foot, and said, "Even if the person dies, you have to pay if you hired a doctor!" Kang Zhilian was so angry that he threw the bowl of unfinished rice at the Baozhang's face, causing him to bleed. Then he grabbed a wooden stick and swung it. The doctor blocked the stick and, together with the Baozhang, grabbed Kang Zhilian and dragged him from his home to the township office and locked him up. A few days later, they sent him to Yuxian City along with seventy or eighty other draftees rounded up from other places, tied them up and sent them to Zhengzhou to be soldiers. When they arrived in a village on the outskirts of Zhengzhou, the first day, an officer with a leather belt ordered Kang Zhilian to cook. He cooked one meal in the morning, but when he went to cook again in the evening, he put the mess kit on the stove and ran away with the rice on his back.

…Digging in from the outlet side, the soil was relatively solid at first, but the further they dug, the worse the soil became. After each explosion, stones and sand kept falling, and the migrant workers had to quickly push the exploded stones and soil out of the tunnel in dump trucks so that the supports could be erected quickly. One night, it was raining heavily, and rainwater kept pouring down from the mountain, quickly accumulating a large pool of muddy water at the entrance of the tunnel. At that time, more than forty migrant workers were draining water at the entrance of the tunnel. The rain kept getting heavier, and suddenly, a shower of gravel fell from the top of the tunnel entrance. When the people working at the entrance saw the gravel falling, they ran into the tunnel. Then, with a crash, a large piece of the tunnel entrance collapsed. The stones and soil almost completely blocked the entire entrance, leaving only some narrow gaps at the top. People crawled out of those gaps one by one. Kang Zhilian was pushing a dump truck in the rain when he saw the tunnel entrance collapse. He immediately directed all the migrant workers to dig open the entrance. The heavy rain continued to fall. They stood in the rainwater covered with gravel and mud, and the pouring rain made their soaked clothes gleam in the light of the electric lamps. The tunnel was getting deeper and deeper. After each explosion, the black smoke from the explosives couldn't escape, and it took a long time to exhaust the smoke with the blowers. At this time, without waiting for the smoke to clear, Kang Zhilian led the migrant workers to rush into the tunnel, holding their breath as much as possible, loading the exploded stones and soil into the dump trucks, and then pushing the trucks out quickly. After they finished working, their white clothes turned yellow, their black hands became even blacker, and although they wore masks while working, the saliva they spat out was still black, and their mouths were so bitter that they couldn't even eat. When the outlet side had been dug in seventy or eighty meters, the soil in the tunnel was particularly bad. After one explosion, stones and soil kept collapsing from the top. Kang Zhilian and the migrant workers had just finished clearing the collapsed stones and soil with dump trucks and hadn't had time to erect the supports when another large piece collapsed. One careless move could bury someone inside. At this time, some people began to be afraid, pushing the dump trucks into the tunnel, but before the trucks were full, they desperately pushed them out again. Seeing this situation, Kang Zhilian decided to stay in the tunnel himself. After one shift of migrant workers finished work, Kang Zhilian ate a little steamed bread that someone brought into the tunnel and continued to direct the work of another shift of migrant workers. Because the soil was too loose to explode, Kang Zhilian directed the migrant workers to clear the collapsed stones and soil, quickly erect supports, and, along with the migrant workers, used hoes to excavate the tunnel. The workers were just as nervous as the migrant workers. To prevent accidents in the tunnel, they stayed with the migrant workers day and night, constantly checking the rock layers and soil, and constantly reminding the migrant workers to avoid all possible dangers. There was a worker named Xu Qinglin who, while conducting a safety inspection in the tunnel, said to Kang Zhilian, "Old Kang, the tunnel will give you a warning before it collapses, so pay attention to the signs!" Kang Zhilian said, "Who will give me a warning?" Xu Qinglin said, "When the tunnel is about to collapse, small stones will fall first, and then large stones will fall. Run away as soon as you see small stones falling. You can always wait a little longer at home for your wife to come back, but don't wait for that guy to come,..." Before he could finish speaking, a stone fell from the top, hitting Xu Qinglin right in the middle of his back, knocking him unconscious to the ground. Kang Zhilian quickly ordered several people to carry him to the construction site hospital on a stretcher, continued to clear the pile of stones and soil, and then erected supports with the migrant workers. They climbed on the supports and erected them while stones and sand fell down. At this time, next to Kang Zhilian, there was a young farmer of twenty-four or five years old named Guo Haishan, who was climbing on the supports with Kang Zhilian. In order to quickly erect the supports, they were so busy that they didn't even look up. Just then, a fist-sized stone fell next to Kang Zhilian. Kang Zhilian looked up at Guo Haishan and said, "Guo Haishan, did the stone hit you?" Guo Haishan touched his head, and a stream of blood flowed down, and before he could speak, half of his body was stained red. Kang Zhilian quickly helped him down from the supports. Guo Haishan said, "I'll go to the first-aid station myself, you go up and continue working." Kang Zhilian asked another migrant worker to help him to the first-aid station at the tunnel entrance, and then hurried back to the supports. Before long, Guo Haishan had his wound bandaged by the doctor at the first-aid station, washed the blood off his face, and without changing his clothes, ran back into the tunnel and climbed onto the supports again. Kang Zhilian told him to go back and rest. But he said, "It's almost time to get off work, it's okay." Kang Zhilian had to pull him down from the supports. In the deep tunnel, under the light of the electric lamps, no one knew when it was day and when it was night. Kang Zhilian constantly directed the migrant workers to clear the stones and soil in the tunnel, quickly erect supports, and excavate the tunnel, until they dug into the tunnel and saw relatively thick rock layers that could be blasted with explosives, then they came out of the tunnel.

Accompanied by the roaring explosions, people worked tirelessly day and night for five months. After the water diversion tunnel was completed, the entire reservoir project has now also been completed. Clear river water flows out of the water diversion tunnel of the reservoir, singing beneath the cliffs about the people who created happiness, and then flows torrentially through a newly opened channel to irrigate the vast fields in the Huai River basin.

    开凿隧道的英雄
    ——记白沙水库输水隧道的建筑工程
    白原
    那些爆炸的巨大的响声轰隆隆地响着。淮河上游的白沙水库工程刚开工，首先就得把一条三百四十六公尺长的输水隧道开出来，把水库区域里的河水引到一段新挖的河道里面去，不然其他工程就无法进行。那爆炸的响声从一座耸立的悬崖下发出来。接着，好像一座山眼看就要整个地从空中倒下来一样，巨大的岩石和无尽的沙土从山上塌下来。四月里的河水从悬崖下滔滔地流过，被一阵落下的石头和沙土击起飞溅的水花。因为山上的土质太松，一开始，输水隧道进水口的洞口刚一炸开就被山上塌下的沙土和岩石堵住了。人们只好一镢头一镢头地掏着，把堵住洞口的沙土和岩石掏出来，然后一边搭起木排架撑住洞顶的岩石，一边往里面打进去。但是，石头和沙土还是不住地从洞顶往下掉。山洞里面，除了坚硬的岩层以外，在岩层中间夹着的全是一层层沙土和松散的石头。
    参加开凿这一条隧洞的，有钻工，窑工，石匠，抹洋灰、搭排架、扎钢筋的建筑工人，也有从民工中挑选出来的农民。这是一个艰巨的工程，而且要赶时间把它完成。工程日夜不停地进行着。在一阵巨大的爆炸以后，这些工人和农民们就跑进洞里去检查，用铁锤击落那些没有炸掉的石头，搭起排架。等到民工们把所有的土块和石头都用斗车从伸进洞里去的轻便铁轨上推出来以后，打钻工人就开动机器，向坚硬的岩层钻出了一个个洞眼，安上炸药和火线，接着又是一阵震天动地的爆炸。从进水口这边打进去，打了一个月，在进水口南边的出水口那里又开了工。
    在出水口那边，有一个民工中队，一共有一百二十个人，都是从河南省禹县来的参加治淮的农民。山洞里刚爆炸完，他们就从山坡上跑下来，随着工人们走向洞里去。这时候，在队伍当中有一个人一边走着一边就对大伙儿说：“同志们，走吧，工人到那里咱们到那里，……”这就是这一个民工中队的中队长，共产党员康志廉。在这一个中队里，大家对他都很熟悉：三十多岁，中等个子，看起来是一个顽强的很精明能干的人。如果要想知道他的底细，人们就会告诉你：和大伙儿一样，在旧社会里受尽了欺侮，但却是天不怕地不怕那么个人。
    因为家里很穷，康志廉十三、四岁的时候就在禹县顺店镇街上摆了个纸烟摊，十五、六岁时跟在驴屁股后面给人家赶脚、驮煤，到后来，就给地主种地，一直到解放以后，才解脱了旧社会套在他脖子上的缰绳。康志廉十七岁时候就结了婚。在他十八岁那年，老婆身上长了个恶疮。康志廉在顺店镇街上给她请了个医生，说是包治一切毒疮毒症，治不好可以不给钱。可是不知吃了几付什么药，老婆身上的疮一点也没有好。那时候，骗子和衙门结成了一气。这个包治一切毒疮毒症的医生找了保长一同来要钱。那一天康志廉正在家里吃早饭，老婆的疮没有好，家里生活又困难，正愁得没法。康志廉说：“人没有治好，怎么就要钱？”保长瞪着双凶狠狠的眼睛，脚一蹬，就说：“那怕人死了，请了医生就得给钱！”康志廉气不过把手上还没有吃净饭的碗照着保长脸上掷过去，打得保长血流满脸，接着又顺手拉起一根木棒打过去。那医生挡住康志廉打来的木棒，和扑上来的保长一同把康志廉抓着，从家里把他拉到乡公所关起来。过了几天，就把他送到禹县城里，和从其他地方抓来的七、八十个壮丁一起绑着送到郑州去当兵。到了郑州郊外的一个村子里，第一天，一个挂皮带的军官叫康志廉去做饭。他早上去做了一顿饭，可是到黄昏再去做饭时，他把行军锅搁在灶上，却把米背起来跑掉了。
    ……从出水口这边打进去，开始土质还比较结实，可是越往里打，土质也就越坏。每一次爆炸以后，石头和沙土还是不住地往下掉，民工们必须赶快把爆炸后的石头和土块用斗车从洞里推出来，好赶快把排架搭起来。有一天夜里，正下着大雨，雨水不住地从山上冲下来，很快在洞口就积了一大滩泥水。那时候，有四十多个民工在洞口里往外排水。雨愈下愈大，突然，一阵碎石从洞口的顶上落下来。在洞口里工作的人们一看见碎石掉下来就往洞里跑。接着，哗啦一声，洞口塌下来一大块。石头和土块几乎把整个洞口都堵住了，只剩下顶上一些窄窄的隙缝。人们一个个地从那些隙缝里爬出来。康志廉正在雨水里推着一辆斗车，看见洞口塌了，立刻指挥所有的民工来把洞口挖开。大雨一直不停地下着。他们踩在铺满碎石和稀泥的雨水里，倾注的雨水使湿透的衣服在电灯的光线下闪着亮光。山洞愈打愈深。每次爆炸后，炸药的黑烟出不来，用鼓风器也得好久才能把烟往外抽净。这时候，没有等烟出尽，康志廉就带领民工推着斗车冲进洞里去，尽可能止住呼吸把爆炸下来的石头和土块装到斗车里，然后就推着斗车飞快地跑出来。人们工作完了，白衣服变成了黄衣，一双乌黑的手变得更黑了，虽然工作时戴着口罩，但从嘴里吐出来的唾沫仍然是黑的，嘴里苦得连饭也吃不下。当出水口这边打进去七、八十公尺的时候，洞里的土质特别坏。有一次爆炸以后，石头和土块就一直从顶上塌下来。康志廉和民工们一起刚刚把塌下来的石头和土块用斗车清除干净，还没有来得及把排架搭好，另一个地方又塌下来一大块。一不小心，就可能把人埋在里面了。这时候，有的人开始害怕起来，推着斗车跑到洞里，斗车还没有装满，就又拚命推着往外跑。康志廉看到这个情况，就让自己一直留在隧洞里。一班民工下班以后，康志廉吃了一点点由别人带进洞里去的馍馍，又继续在洞里指挥另一班民工的工作。因为土质太松，不能爆炸，康志廉在洞里一边指挥民工清除塌下来的石头和土块，抢搭排架，一边就和民工们一起用镢头来开挖隧洞。工人们也和民工们一样紧张。为了防备洞里发生事故，他们日夜和民工们在一起，不停地在洞里检查岩层和土质，随时告诉民工们注意避免各种可能发生的危险。有一个工人叫徐庆林，有一次在洞里进行安全检查的时候对康志廉说：“老康，洞要塌下来的时候会预先给你送信，好好注意着号！”康志廉说：“谁给送信？”徐庆林说：“洞要塌下来的时候，先掉小的石头，然后就掉大石头。看到掉小石头就赶紧跑。老婆出了门可以在家里多候候，那家伙可不要去等，……”话还没有说完，一块石头从顶上落下来，正好打在徐庆林的腰中间，把徐庆林打晕在地上。康志廉赶紧叫几个人用担架把他送到工地医院去，继续把一堆石头和土块清除净，就和民工们一起来搭排架。他们爬在排架上一边搭，石头和沙土一边往下掉。这时候，在康志廉旁边，有一个二十四、五岁的青年农民叫郭海山，和康志廉一起爬在排架上。为了抢着把排架搭起来，他们连头也不抬地在忙碌着。正在这时候，一颗拳头大的石头从康志廉旁边落下来。康志廉抬头看一看郭海山，就说：“郭海山，石头打着你了吧。”郭海山往头上一摸，一股鲜血跟着就往下流，来不及说话，一下子半个身子都染红了。康志廉赶紧搂着他下了排架。郭海山说：“我自己到急救站去，你上去坚持工作吧。”康志廉叫另一个民工扶他到洞口的急救站去，就又赶紧上了排架。不多一会，郭海山让急救站的医生包扎好伤口，把脸上的血洗了洗，衣服也没有换，自己又跑进洞里，爬到排架上来了。康志廉叫他回去休息。但是他说：“一会就下班了，不要紧。”康志廉硬拉着他，才把他从排架上拉下去。在深深的隧洞里，在照明的电灯光下，不知道什么时候是白天，也不知道什么时候是黑夜。康志廉不停地指挥民工，清除洞里的石头和土块，抢搭排架，开挖隧道，一直挖到隧洞里看见比较厚的岩层，可以用炸药爆炸的时候，才从洞里走出来。
    伴随着那隆隆的爆炸的响声，人们日夜不息地劳作着，一直继续了五个月。输水隧道打通以后，现在，整个水库工程也都已经完成了。清澈的河水从水库的输水隧道里流出来，在悬崖下歌唱着那些创造幸福的人们，然后滔滔地流过一段新开的河道，去灌溉淮河流域广大的田地。
