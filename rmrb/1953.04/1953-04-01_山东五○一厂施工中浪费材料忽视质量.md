Shandong 501 Factory Neglects Quality and Wastes Materials During Construction
Serious waste and neglect of engineering quality have occurred in the construction of the Shandong 501 Factory Engineering Company.

In the civil engineering construction of the 501 Factory Engineering Company, a mixture of cement, lime, and sand in a ratio of 1:1:6 is being used for the base coat of the wall plastering, followed by a lime whitewash. This practice violates regulations and is prone to causing cracks and affecting quality. The plastering in the distribution room is particularly wasteful recently, with pure cement used for the first coat, cement-mixed sand for the second, and lime for the third. This is a serious waste of cement and violates operating procedures. The company's lumber processing yard also experiences significant wood waste, with a yield rate of only 60%, 15% lower than the state-stipulated yield rate. Based on the factory's current wood inventory, the wasted lumber could meet the housing needs of 2,000 workers.

The company is performing rivet welding on a steel structure frame for a major project. The quality of the rivets is very low, with approximately 50% failing to meet standards. In addition to mismatched eye holes, deviations in rivet welding, and many discarded eyes, it was recently discovered that the company is using oxygen to burn holes, which not only wastes the domestically scarce oxygen but also results in all the oxygen-burned holes being oversized, irregular, and completely unusable. The welding work is similarly careless and substandard. For example, when welding steel beams, only the exterior surface is welded, leaving a gap on the back side large enough to fit a finger. When two-thirds of the main angle iron of a steel beam was found to be cracked, they did not weld it but simply covered it with a fitted steel plate.

The above-mentioned waste and poor quality issues are very serious, but they have not attracted the attention of the company's leading cadres and have not been seriously addressed to this day.

### 山东五○一厂施工中浪费材料忽视质量

    山东五○一厂施工中浪费材料忽视质量
    山东五○一厂工程公司在施工中发生了严重的浪费和忽视工程质量的现象。
    五○一厂工程公司正在施工中的土木建筑工程，墙面抹灰都用一比一比六的洋灰，石灰和砂子抹底灰，然后再抹石灰粉白。这样做法是违反规定的，而且容易发生龟裂细纹，影响质量。最近在配电室内抹灰更是浪费，第一遍用纯洋灰，第二遍用掺有洋灰的砂子灰，第三遍用石灰。这实在是一种严重浪费洋灰的作法，并违反了操作规程。该公司原木加工场浪费木材现象也很严重，成材率仅达百分之六十，比国家规定的成材率低百分之十五。以该厂现存的木材量计算，损失的木材可供建造二千个工人住房的需要。
    该公司正在一座主要工程的钢结构房架上进行铆焊，铆钉质量很低，不合标准的占总数百分之五十左右。除眼孔不对，钉焊偏差，废眼很多，结合不紧外，最近更发现该公司竟使用氧气烧孔，不仅浪费了国内最感缺乏的氧气，而且凡用氧气烧过的都是眼大不规则，全部成了废品。在焊接工程上也同样是马虎草率，不合标准。如焊接钢梁时，只焊实外表的一面，背面的空隙可穿过一个手指。有一根钢梁的主要角铁横裂了三分之二，他们也不焊接处理，盖上配装钢板就算完事了。
    上述浪费现象和质量低劣的情况是很严重的，但未引起该公司领导干部的重视，直到现在还未认真处理。
