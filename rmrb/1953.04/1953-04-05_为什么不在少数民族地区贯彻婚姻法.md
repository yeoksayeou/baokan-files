    Why the Marriage Law is not Implemented in Ethnic Minority Regions

    Question: Why is the Marriage Law not implemented in ethnic minority regions?

    Answer: The reason why the Marriage Law is not implemented in ethnic minority regions is based on the specific circumstances and social conditions of the ethnic minorities. China is a multi-ethnic country, and the development of China's various ethnic groups varies greatly. Therefore, the social and economic conditions, living habits, religious beliefs, and marriage systems of each ethnic group are different. The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is basically formulated according to the conditions in Han areas and cannot be rigidly applied to ethnic minority areas without modification. The appendix to the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China states: "In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, the People's Governments (or Military and Administrative Committees) of the Greater Administrative Areas or the Provincial People's Governments may, based on the specific circumstances of marriage issues of the ethnic minorities, formulate certain modified or supplementary provisions to this law and submit them to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation." The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China takes into account the specific circumstances of ethnic minorities, rather than requiring that the Marriage Law be implemented in ethnic minority areas in the same way as in Han areas.

    The directive of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on implementing the Marriage Law states: "A large-scale mass movement to publicize the Marriage Law and inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law should be launched throughout the country (excluding ethnic minority areas and areas where land reform has not yet been completed)..." This also definitely indicates that it is not yet appropriate for us to publicize and implement the Marriage Law in ethnic minority areas.

    为什么不在少数民族地区贯彻婚姻法
    问：为什么不在少数民族地区贯彻婚姻法？
    答：不在少数民族地区贯彻婚姻法，是根据少数民族的具体情况和社会条件来决定的。中国是多民族的国家，中国各民族的发展情况极不相同，因之各民族的社会、经济情况、生活习惯、宗教信仰以及婚姻制度均有不同。中华人民共和国婚姻法基本上是按汉族地区情况制定的，不能原封不动地向少数民族地区硬性搬用。中华人民共和国婚姻法的附则中说：“在少数民族聚居地区，大行政区人民政府（或军政委员会）或省人民政府，得依据少数民族婚姻问题的具体情况，对本法制定某些变通的或补充的规定，提请政务院批准施行。”中华人民共和国婚姻法是照顾了少数民族的具体情况，而不是要求在少数民族地区和汉族地区一样贯彻婚姻法的。
    中央人民政府政务院关于贯彻婚姻法的指示中说：“在全国范围内（少数民族地区和尚未完成土地改革的地区除外）开展一个大规模的宣传婚姻法检查婚姻法执行情况的群众运动……。”这也就肯定地指示我们尚不宜在少数民族地区去宣传贯彻婚姻法。
