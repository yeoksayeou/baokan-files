    On March 14, 1953, the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet passed a vote of no confidence in the Yoshida government by 229 votes to 218. Immediately after the Diet vote, an imperial edict signed by the Emperor and the Prime Minister regarding the dissolution of the House of Representatives was announced. The Yoshida government preferred to dissolve the Diet rather than resign. New elections will be held on April 19 and 26, 1953.

    The dissolved Diet was elected in October 1952, a few months after the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" came into effect. As is well known, the United States, through these treaties, has reduced Japan to a U.S. dependency, subordinating Japan's national interests to those of the U.S. ruling clique.

    With the continued occupation by the United States and the active activities of Japanese reactionary forces, the pro-American Liberal Party, representing Japanese big capitalists and landlords, won a majority in the Diet (241 out of 466 seats). This allowed the Liberal Party to establish a government. After a long period of internal party strife, Yoshida formed his fourth cabinet on October 24. The characteristics of the fourth Yoshida cabinet can be seen from the following facts: seven of the seventeen ministers were war criminals and purged individuals. Most cabinet members were big capitalists or warlords from the former Japanese state military apparatus.

    It is worth noting that even before the current cabinet was formed, Japanese newspapers predicted that it would not last long. For example, Kyodo News Agency stated on October 9: "Whoever leads the next cabinet will collapse quickly." This prediction was based on two factors: first, the ruling party's majority in the Diet was too small; second, serious internal disputes occurred within the Liberal Party itself, reflecting the competition between different capitalist groups within the country.

    If the Japanese big bourgeoisie closely related to military production supports rearmament and fully supports the Yoshida government's execution of U.S. war policies, then another part of the bourgeoisie closely related to peaceful industries expresses dissatisfaction with the government's policies.

    They demand the expansion of foreign markets, especially the restoration of economic relations with China. The most powerful proof is that among the 310 members of the League of Parliamentarians Advocating the Restoration of Japan-China Trade, 70 are Liberal Party members.

    The Yoshida government has focused its main attention on implementing the plan to rearm Japan in accordance with U.S. government policies. The so-called "Security Forces" have now been expanded to 110,000 people, which is a core force composed of officers and non-commissioned officers, capable of being expanded into a large-scale force in a short period of time. Under the same circumstances, the so-called "Maritime Safety Agency" was established.

    In order to implement the rearmament policy, the Yoshida government has been instilling the militaristic ideas that prevailed in Japan in the past into the Japanese people. War-themed films are being shown. Newspapers, magazines, and books that promote militarism are being published. Efforts are being made to promote emperor worship. Military songs are being restored. Preparations are being made to release all war criminals.

    At the same time, the Yoshida government launched a frenzied attack on the working class and its organizations. The police system was strengthened. The "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" was implemented, and preparations were made to ban strikes. In rural areas, a policy aimed at consolidating the power of landlords and rich peasants is being implemented. Tenant farmers are being deprived of the land they have cultivated for generations.

    Peaceful industries are shrinking. Most factories have accepted military orders from U.S. imperialism, which is closely linked to the U.S. war of aggression against Korea and plans to expand the war in Asia.

    From this, it can be seen that the Yoshida government's domestic policy is anti-people, aimed at militarizing Japan, further subordinating Japan's economy to U.S. war plans, and turning Japanese territory into a U.S. base in the Far East. As for the Yoshida government's foreign policy, it completely subordinates Japan to the United States, sells out Japan's national sovereignty, and obediently implements all of Washington's instructions. Under the support of the U.S. military regime, Japanese reactionaries are once again becoming a breeding ground for aggressive forces in the Far East.

    If this policy is suitable for the requirements of the Japanese ruling clique, then it is a completely different matter for the broad masses of the Japanese people. The broad Japanese workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and even some large bourgeoisie are increasingly and strongly opposing the Yoshida government's policies. After the May Day demonstration in Tokyo in 1952, strikes and demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people have become extremely common phenomena in Japan. These demonstrations have broad mass participation. For example, a rally and demonstration of 30,000 people was held in Tokyo on March 15 to oppose the bill restricting strikes, to oppose increasing military budgets, and to oppose the occupation of Japan by U.S. troops.

    Dissatisfaction with Yoshida's policies is even reflected in the speeches of parliamentarians from various parties in the Diet, who have to reflect the sentiments of their constituents to some extent.

    Kitarura Tokutaro, a member of the Reform Party, said when explaining the vote of no confidence in the government on March 14: "Because the Yoshida government has cooperated with the occupying forces and gathered reactionaries, it has brought endless real disasters to the people. Prime Minister Yoshida relies more on the U.S. occupying authorities than anyone else. The actions of the Yoshida government are to establish a vassal state and sign unequal treaties, which is the greatest shame of our generation... Japan has not yet established normal diplomatic relations with Asian countries, which is of great significance to the Japanese economy, and it creates anarchy in foreign policy."

    Asanuma Inajiro, a member of the right-wing Socialist Party, also delivered a speech attacking Yoshida. He said: "Contrary to the wishes of the people, the Yoshida government is pursuing a policy that restores fascist reactionary forces, uses U.S. troops to guarantee Japan's security, and follows the United States in foreign policy.... The government has revived the 'Zaibatsu' by revising the Anti-Monopoly Law."

    Hara Hyo, of the left-wing Socialist Party, also pointed out in his speech that the Yoshida government's policy lies in ensuring that capitalists cruelly exploit the working people. He said: "Under the guise of maintaining social order, the government is stepping up the establishment of a fascist dictatorship, blatantly trampling on the constitution, and it is even more shameless in constantly declaring that it does not seem to be implementing rearmament... Although the Yoshida government said that signing the 'peace treaty' was for peace, independence, and security, facts have proven that the San Francisco Conference has subordinated our country to the United States. The Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' stipulates that Japan has an obligation to rearm in accordance with the intentions of the United States."

    Undoubtedly, both the Japanese Reform Party and the "Socialist Party" are responsible for the policies implemented by the Yoshida government. They have helped Yoshida implement this anti-people policy. The "Socialist Party" has made it its basic mission to oppose the true democratic forces in the country and split the ranks of the Japanese working class and peasantry. But even so, they now have to criticize Yoshida's policies, which is enough to show the kind of situation that the entire political atmosphere in Japan has developed to now.

    It is clear that the Yoshida government, which has dissolved the Diet, is preparing to use the power of the police and the U.S. occupying authorities to manipulate the "elections" so that the Yoshida government can obtain a more reliable majority in the Diet in order to gain the opportunity to further sell out the interests of the Japanese people.

    But it must be known that the Japanese people's awareness is growing rapidly. Undoubtedly, the Japanese people will eventually see through the faces of the bourgeois parties and the "Socialist Party." The people are beginning to understand more clearly who their enemies are and who their friends are.

    日本国会为什么解散
    苏联  普利歇夫斯基
    一九五三年三月十四日，日本国会的众议院以二百二十九票对二百一十八票通过了对吉田政府的不信任案，紧接着国会表决以后，就宣布了日皇和首相所签署的关于解散众议院的敕书。吉田政府宁肯解散国会而不愿意辞职。新的选举将于一九五三年四月十九日和二十六日举行。
    被解散的现届国会是在一九五二年十月，即旧金山对日“和约”和美日“安全条约”宣布生效的数月之后选出来的。如所周知，美国借助于这些条约，已把日本沦为美国的附庸，使日本的民族利益服从于美国统治集团的利益。
    在美国继续占领和日本反动势力积极活动的情况下，亲美的、日本大资本家和大地主的政党——自由党，获得了国会的多数（四百六十六席中占二百四十一席）。这使自由党得以建立政权。经过长时间的党内纷争之后，吉田于十月二十四日组成第四届内阁。可以由下列事实看出第四届吉田内阁的特点：在十七个部长中，有七个人是战犯和被整肃分子。大部分内阁阁员都是大资本家或从前日本国家军事机构的军阀。
    值得注意的是，还在现届内阁组成之前，日本的报刊就预言过它的寿命不长。例如，十月九日共同社称：“不论谁领导下届内阁，他都将迅速垮台”。这种预言是根据两种情况：第一、执政党在国会中所占的多数过于微弱；第二、在构成国会多数的自由党本身，发生严重的内部纠纷，反映着国内不同的资本家集团的竞争。
    如果说和军事生产有密切关系的日本大资产阶级，拥护重整军备，全力支持执行美国战争政策的吉田政府，那末另一部分与和平工业有密切关系的资产阶级则对政府的这种政策表示不满。
    他们要求扩大国外市场，特别是要求恢复和中国的经济关系。最有力的证明是：在主张恢复日中贸易的三百一十名议员联盟中，有七十名是自由党议员。
    吉田政府把主要的注意力集中在实行和美国政府政策相符合的重新武装日本的计划上。所谓“保安队”现已扩为十一万人，它是由军官和士官组成的核心部队，能够在短时期内扩充为大规模的部队。在同样的情况下，建立了所谓“海上保安队”。
    为了实行重新武装政策，吉田政府向日本国民灌输着过去在日本盛行的军国主义思想。放映以战争为内容的影片。出版鼓吹军国主义的报纸、杂志和书籍。竭力宣传天皇崇拜。恢复唱军歌。准备释放全部战犯。
    同时，吉田政府向工人阶级及其组织实行了疯狂的进攻。加强警察制度。实施“防止破坏活动法”，准备禁止罢工。在农村实行着旨在巩固地主和富农势力的政策。佃农们世世辈辈耕种的土地被剥夺了。
    和平工业在萎缩。大部分工厂接受了美帝国主义的军事订货，这和美国侵朝战争与扩大亚洲战争的计划是密切相连的。
    由此可见，吉田政府的对内政策是反人民的，目的是使日本军国主义化，使日本的经济进一步服从于美国的战争计划，使日本国土变为美国在远东的基地。至于吉田政府的对外政策，更使日本完全屈从美国，出卖日本的国家主权，俯首贴耳地执行华盛顿的一切指令。在美国军人政权扶植下的日本反动派正重新成为远东侵略势力的渊薮。
    如果说这种政策是适合日本统治集团的要求的，那末对广大的日本人民群众说来却完全是另外一回事。广大的日本工人、农民、城市小资产阶级甚至一部分大资产阶级，越来越频繁地、越来越强烈地反对吉田政府的政策。在一九五二年五月一日东京大示威之后，数万人的罢工和示威游行已成为日本的极平常的现象。这些示威都具有广泛的群众性。比如，三月十五日在东京举行了三万人的集会和示威，反对限制罢工法案，反对增加军事预算，反对美国军队占领日本。
    对吉田政策的不满情绪，甚至在国会里各党派议员的演说中也表现出来，他们不得不在某种程度上反映他们的选举人的情绪。
    改进党议员北村德太郎在解释三月十四日的对政府不信任案时说：“由于吉田政府和占领部队合作并纠集反动分子，已给人民带来无穷的真正灾难。吉田首相比任何一个人都更依靠于美国占领当局。吉田政府的作为，就是建立附庸国，签订不平等条约，这是我们这一代人的最大耻辱……日本迄今还没有和亚洲国家建立正常的外交关系，这对日本经济是具有巨大意义的，它造成对外政策的无政府状态”。
    右派社会党议员浅沼稻次郎也发表了抨击吉田的演说。他说：“和人民的愿望相反，吉田政府执行着这样的政策，它恢复法西斯反动势力，用美国军队来保障日本的安全，并在对外政策上追随美国……。政府借助于修改反垄断法复活了‘财阀’。”
    左派社会党的原彪也在自己的演说中指出，吉田政府的政策在于保证资本家残酷剥削劳动人民。他说：“在维持社会秩序的口号掩饰下，政府正加紧建立法西斯独裁制度，明目张胆地蹂躏宪法，而且它更厚颜无耻地不断声明，似乎并没有实行重新武装……。虽然吉田政府说签订‘和约’是为了和平、独立与保障安全，但事实证明旧金山会议已把我国从属于美国。日美‘安全条约’规定日本有义务按照美国的意图而重新武装”。
    无疑的，不论是日本改进党，还是“社会党”，都对吉田政府所执行的政策负有责任。他们曾帮助吉田实行了这种反人民的政策。“社会党”把反对国内真正的民主力量和分裂日本工人阶级与农民队伍，作为自己的基本使命。但即使如此，他们现在也不得不抨击吉田的政策，这足以说明现在日本整个的政治空气已经发展到怎样一种情况。
    很明显，解散了国会的吉田政府，正准备利用警察和美国占领当局的力量操纵“选举”，使吉田政府在国会中得到比较可靠的多数，以便取得机会进一步出卖日本人民群众的利益。
    但必须知道，日本人民的觉悟正在迅速成长。无疑的，日本人民终将识破资产阶级政党和“社会党”的面目。人民开始更清楚地懂得谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。
