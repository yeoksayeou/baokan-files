Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 12th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of April 10th to continue discussing the Polish proposal regarding "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation."

The United States, Belgium, Peru, Ecuador, and the Kuomintang element spoke at the meeting.

The U.S. representative, Gross, opposed all of Poland's suggestions and asked the representatives to reject the Polish proposal. He said that the suggestions in this proposal had been considered by the General Assembly before and had been rejected. Gross defended the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and opposed the Polish suggestion of concluding a five-power peace pact.

The representatives of Belgium, Peru, and Ecuador also opposed Poland's suggestions. Their speeches were virtually indistinguishable from the U.S. representative's speech.

Before the adjournment, the Canadian representative suggested that the deadline for registering to speak should be April 10th, and no later than 6:00 p.m., which was clearly intended to limit and shorten the discussion of the Polish proposal. The inappropriateness of this trick by the Canadian representative and the obviousness of its purpose led even the French representative and representatives of some other countries to not support the Canadian representative's proposal. The Polish and Ukrainian representatives spoke, opposing a hasty discussion of the Polish proposal and requested the representatives to thoroughly consider the Polish proposal, because this proposal contained suggestions of great significance to the people of the world. At this time, the Canadian representative saw that his proposal was obviously going to fail, so he hurriedly withdrew his original proposal.

The next meeting of the Political Committee is scheduled to be held on April 13th.

    联大政委会继续讨论波兰和平提案
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：联合国大会政治委员会在四月十日上午举行会议，继续讨论波兰提出的关于“消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”的提案。
    美国、比利时、秘鲁、厄瓜多尔和国民党分子在会上发言。
    美国代表葛罗斯反对波兰的全部建议，并要求代表们否决波兰的提案。他说，这个提案中的建议以前就经过大会考虑，并且被否决过。葛罗斯为侵略性的北大西洋公约辩护，反对波兰提出的关于缔结五大国和平公约的建议。
    比利时、秘鲁和厄瓜多尔的代表也反对波兰的建议。他们的发言和美国代表的发言简直没有什么区别。
    在休会之前，加拿大代表建议，登记发言的截止期到四月十日为止，并且最晚不得超过下午六时，这显然是打算限制和缩短对波兰提案的讨论。加拿大代表的这种诡计的不得当，它的目的的如此明显，甚至连法国代表和其他某些国家的代表都不支持加拿大代表的提议。波兰代表和乌克兰代表发言，反对草率地讨论波兰提案，并要求代表们彻底地考虑波兰提案，因为这个提案里包含对世界人民具有重大意义的建议。这时，加拿大代表看到他的提议显然一定会失败，便赶紧撤消原来的提议。
    政治委员会下次会议定于四月十三日举行。
