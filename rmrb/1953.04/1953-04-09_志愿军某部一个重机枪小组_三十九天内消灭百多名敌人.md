Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 8th: Our front-line correspondent Ning Huanming reports: In the extensive sniper movement on the Iron Triangle front, a heavy machine gun squad of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers eliminated 139 American soldiers in thirty-nine days.

This heavy machine gun sniper squad consists of three people, fighting under the leadership of Communist Party member Hao Fenglin. Every day at dawn, Youth League member Yu Xiaogen goes to the observation post to observe the enemy's situation; Hao Fenglin and machine gunner He Fugui load the bullets into the chamber, ready to fire. As soon as they hear Yu Xiaogen shout "Enemy spotted at target number...", they set the distance, aim and shoot at the enemy.

One morning, about two platoons of enemies tried to sneak across a small bridge. Hao Fenglin and He Fugui fired twelve bullets and killed or wounded four enemies. They recognized that this small bridge was a frequent route for the enemy, so they agreed with a light machine gunner to jointly block it. At 4 p.m. that day, a platoon of American troops climbed onto the small bridge again. Gunfire rang out. The heavy machine gun of Hao Fenglin's squad and the light machine gun they had agreed with used firepower to intercept the enemy's outposts and cut off the enemy's retreat. The entire platoon of American troops fell into the dense net of fire, and were beaten into chaos, rolling and screaming. That day, Hao Fenglin's squad killed a total of twenty-eight American soldiers and wounded eight.

One day, Yu Xiaogen was looking for targets at the observation post when suddenly the enemy fired a few shells and collapsed the observation post, and Yu Xiaogen was crushed inside. At this time, he thought: The more fierce the enemy's artillery fire, the greater the possibility of the enemy coming out to operate. Therefore, he endured the pain, climbed out and continued to observe. Sure enough, he found that a group of enemies was in action. When Hao Fenglin received his report, he immediately killed three enemies.

In addition to fighting during the day, they have to rush to repair the observation post and machine gun bunker every night, and then sit down together to summarize experience, so that they can fight better the next day.

This heavy machine gun squad with remarkable achievements has been commended by the superior leading organs and has been awarded a collective third-class merit.

    志愿军某部一个重机枪小组
    三十九天内消灭百多名敌人
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本社前线通讯员宁焕明报道：铁原前线中国人民志愿军某部的一个重机枪小组在广泛开展着的狙击运动中，三十九天内消灭了美国兵一百三十九名。
    这个重机枪狙击小组共有三个人，在共产党员郝风林率领下进行战斗。每天天刚亮，青年团员余校根就跑到观察台上去观察敌情；郝风林和机枪手何福贵便把子弹推进枪膛，做好射击准备。一听到余校根呼喊“某号目标发现敌人……”，他们就定好距离，瞄准敌人射击。
    一天早晨约有两个班的敌人想偷偷地通过一座小桥，郝风林、何福贵打出十二发子弹，就打死打伤了四个敌人。他们看准了这座小桥是敌人常来往的地方，就和一个轻机枪射手约定共同封锁这座小桥。当天下午四时，有一个排的美军又爬上这座小桥，枪声响了，郝风林小组的重机枪和他们约好的一挺轻机枪用火力截住了敌人的前哨，又插断了敌人的后路，一个排的美军整个落在稠密的火网里，被打得乱滚乱叫。这一天，郝风林小组共打死美国兵二十八个，打伤八个。
    有一天余校根正在观察台上找目标，忽然敌人打来几发炮弹把观察台打塌了，余校根被压在里面。这时他想：敌炮打得越猛，敌人出来活动的可能性越大。于是，他忍受着疼痛，爬出来继续观察。果然发现有一股敌人正在行动。当时郝风林得到他的报告后，一下子就打死了三个敌人。
    他们除了白天战斗以外，每夜都要赶修观察台和机枪掩体，然后在一起座谈总结经验，使第二天打得更好。
    这个战绩卓著的重机枪小组，得到了上级领导机关的表扬，并荣立集体三等功一次。
