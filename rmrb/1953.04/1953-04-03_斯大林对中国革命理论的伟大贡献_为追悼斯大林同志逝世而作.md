    Stalin's Great Contribution to the Theory of the Chinese Revolution
    -- Written in Mourning of Comrade Stalin's Death
  　Zhang Ruxin
    (I)
    The great Stalin has passed away. After the deaths of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, this is the most grievous and irreparable loss for the working class and oppressed people all over the world. In these sorrowful days, people naturally recall Stalin's past and appreciate Stalin's great contributions to all mankind. As Lenin's best comrade-in-arms and the greatest Marxist after Lenin's death, Stalin made enormous contributions to the Soviet people and the oppressed people of the world. What we Chinese Communists and the Chinese people feel particularly close to and will never forget is this giant's special concern for the Chinese people and his great contribution to the theory of the Chinese revolution.
    The great Stalin has consistently been an enthusiastic inspirer and brilliant mentor of the Chinese people's cause of liberation. As early as 1918, the year before the May Fourth Movement in our country, Stalin emphasized the great international significance of the liberation movement of the oppressed nations of the East and issued the call, "Do not forget the East." Since then, every step forward in the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has attracted Stalin's attention and cheers. In 1925, in one of his speeches, Stalin pointed out that "the strength of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable." During 1924-1927, when the suffering Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, launched a revolutionary offensive with overwhelming force against the man-eating beasts—imperialist warlords—Stalin and the Soviet people under his leadership supported and encouraged the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle with great enthusiasm. In order to shatter the Trotskyite lies about the Chinese revolution, to provide the Chinese Communist Party with Marxist-Leninist theoretical armament on many fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution, and to promote the victory of the Chinese revolution, Stalin wrote many works on the Chinese revolution during this period, advancing Leninism's theory of national and colonial revolution to a new stage.
    Stalin's immortal works on the Chinese revolution written during the period of the First Domestic Revolutionary War in China from 1924 to 1927 mainly include "The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution," "The Question of the Chinese Revolution," "Some Questions Concerning the Chinese Revolution," "Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University," "The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Comintern," "Brief Comments on Current Events," the section on China in "The International Situation and the Defense of the Soviet Union," and "The Political Countenance of the Opposition on Three Questions in China." In these many works, Stalin profoundly expounded a series of issues of the Chinese revolution developing in the new era of the world revolution after the October Socialist Revolution, under the conditions of the continuous sharpening of Soviet socialist construction and the general crisis of capitalism, using the scientific viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism, and gave many extremely brilliant and wise instructions on the political line and strategic tactics that communists should adopt in this revolution. Stalin's many immortal works are a great contribution to the treasure house of Marxist-Leninist theory, and it played a great guiding role in the Chinese revolution. The Chinese revolution over the past two decades has been victorious under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong by following Stalin's instructions.
    (II)
    Stalin's provisions for the political line and strategic tactics of the Chinese revolution were based on his concrete analysis of the economic and political situation and class relations of Chinese society. Stalin pointed out that old China was a semi-colony under the rule and domination of imperialist powers. In 1927, when Stalin refuted the Trotskyite bandit's fallacy that "the Chinese national revolution is mainly a revolution against tariffs," he said: "The strength of imperialism in China lies mainly not in the restriction of Chinese tariffs, but in its holding of factories, mines, railways, ships, and banks in China, from which it extracts the blood and sweat of millions of Chinese workers and peasants." ("Brief Comments on Current Events")
    Stalin revealed that the rule of imperialism in old China was closely combined with the reactionary and corrupt feudal forces within old China, and repeatedly emphasized that the exploitation of peasants by feudal landlords was still the basic form of oppression in the vast rural areas of China. Stalin said: "If 70 percent of the income of peasants in several provinces belongs to landlords and local bullies; if armed or unarmed landlords have not only economic but also administrative and judicial power; if until now the buying and selling of women and children, a medieval practice, is still carried out in some provinces - then it must be admitted that feudal remnants are the basic form of oppression in the provinces of China." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Comintern") The Trotskyite bandit Radek once used the fact that "commercial capital has penetrated the Chinese countryside and rented land to poor peasants" as a reason to deny the existence of feudal forces in the Chinese countryside. In exposing Radek's nonsense, Stalin profoundly revealed the characteristics of Chinese commercial capital and its relationship with feudal forces, saying: "Does commercial capital exist in the Chinese countryside? Yes, it exists, and it extracts blood and sweat from the peasants no less than any feudal lord. But this type of commercial capital of primitive accumulation is uniquely combined with the rule of feudal lords and landlords in the Chinese countryside, and it plagiarizes the medieval methods of exploiting and oppressing peasants from the landlords... That is the crux of the matter." ("Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University").
    Stalin made the following scientific judgment on the political superstructure built on this semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic foundation:
    "The entire warlord bureaucratic apparatus that inhumanely plunders and oppresses Chinese peasants is essentially the political superstructure built on the combination of the rule of feudal remnants and feudal methods of exploitation with the existence of rural merchant capital" ("Brief Comments on Current Events"), "Warlord rule, military governors, provincial governors, and all the current brutal and plundering military and non-military bureaucrats are the superstructure on this uniqueness of China. Imperialism is supporting and consolidating this entire feudal bureaucratic apparatus" ("Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University").
    Everyone knows that after the failure of the Xinhai Revolution in our country in 1911, what replaced the feudal Qing Dynasty to rule the Chinese people was precisely the reactionary and corrupt feudal warlord bureaucratic apparatus centered on the Northern Warlords, as pointed out by Stalin, and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries established after the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War was a feudal-comprador fascist regime. This political superstructure—the warlord-bureaucratic rule system—built on a semi-feudal economic foundation was, on the one hand, the political representative of the domestic feudal landlord class, and on the other hand, it was closely linked with foreign imperialism and became their agent in China. It was precisely this reactionary and corrupt feudal warlord bureaucratic rule system that consolidated and strengthened the exploitation and oppression of feudal forces, and acted as a pathfinder for imperialist aggression and rule in China, making the lives of the Chinese people increasingly worse and the national crisis increasingly deeper.
    (III)
    Based on a profound Marxist analysis of the nature and characteristics of Chinese society, Stalin determined that the current stage of the Chinese revolution is a bourgeois democratic revolution against feudalism and imperialism. Stalin said: "The Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution is not only against feudal remnants. It is also against imperialism." "The current revolution in China is the confluence of two revolutionary movements—the movement against feudal remnants and the movement against imperialism." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Comintern")
    Stalin's brilliant and wise judgment on the nature of the Chinese revolution thoroughly shattered the Trotskyite bandit's nonsense that denied the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal nature of the Chinese revolution, and also gave a powerful warning to Chen Duxiu's opportunism within the Chinese Communist Party at that time. One of Chen Duxiu's main erroneous views during the First Domestic Revolutionary War was that he only saw the anti-imperialist side of the Chinese revolution, while completely ignoring the anti-feudal side of the Chinese revolution, thus shamefully hindering the development of the peasant land revolution. This was one of the subjective reasons for the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War. Stalin at that time severely criticized this opportunist view, saying: "I know that among the Kuomintang members, and even among the Communist Party members, some people do not think it is possible to launch a rural revolution, fearing that the involvement of peasants in the revolution will undermine the united front against imperialism. Comrades, this is a big mistake. The faster and more thoroughly the Chinese peasants are involved in the revolution, the more powerful and stronger the united front against imperialism in China will be." ("The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution")
    Our party's great leader, Stalin's faithful student and comrade-in-arms, Comrade Mao Zedong, during the First Domestic War, resolutely opposed Chen Duxiu's opportunism by standing on the position of Lenin and Stalin, actively supported the peasant movement, and thoroughly implemented the struggle against imperialism. Later, in various periods of the Chinese revolution, he faithfully implemented Stalin's brilliant instructions, correctly grasped the dialectical relationship between the two major currents of the Chinese revolution, and led the Chinese revolution to a complete victory.
    When comprehensively discussing the nature and characteristics of the Chinese revolution, Stalin emphasized the following three extremely important characteristics of the Chinese revolution:
    "The first characteristic is that the Chinese revolution is a bourgeois democratic revolution, and at the same time, it is a national liberation revolution, whose knife is aimed at the rule of foreign imperialism in China. This is the first difference between it and the Russian Revolution of 1905... Therefore, the Chinese revolution is directly linked to the anti-imperialist revolution of proletarians in various countries."
    The second characteristic is that "the national bourgeoisie in China is extremely weak and backward, and they are incomparably weaker than the Russian bourgeoisie in the 1905 period." "But from this, it can be concluded that the role of the initiators and leaders of the Chinese revolution, the role of the leaders of the Chinese peasants, must inevitably fall into the hands of the Chinese proletariat and its party." ("The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution")
    The third characteristic is that "there is the Soviet Union existing and developing beside China, whose revolutionary experience and assistance cannot but promote the Chinese proletariat's struggle against imperialism and against the medieval feudal remnants of China" ("The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution").
    The characteristics of the Chinese revolution emphasized by Stalin here are decisive for the entire development direction of the Chinese revolution, because since the Chinese revolution is not an ordinary bourgeois revolution but a national democratic revolution with the above-mentioned characteristics, it is obvious that the road and future of the Chinese revolution will inevitably be as Stalin predicted: "Either the national bourgeoisie will defeat the proletariat, collude with imperialism, and jointly attack the revolution,...; or the proletariat will squeeze the national bourgeoisie aside, consolidate its leadership, lead the millions of working masses in urban and rural areas to overcome the resistance of the national bourgeoisie, achieve the complete victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and then gradually transfer it to the track of the socialist revolution, accompanied by all the consequences arising therefrom." ("The Question of the Chinese Revolution") Stalin then further pointed out: "The crisis of world capitalism and the existence of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union - the experience of this dictatorship can be successfully used by the Chinese proletariat - greatly facilitate the possibility of the realization of the second road of the Chinese revolution." "Therefore, the basic task of the Communists is to fight for the victory of the second road of the Chinese revolution" (ibid.).
    In this way, Stalin clearly determined that the Chinese revolution is a new type of bourgeois democratic revolution, which grows in the new era of the world proletarian revolution after the October Socialist Revolution. Therefore, it is a part of the world proletarian revolution, its leadership must belong to the proletariat, and the future of the bourgeois democratic revolution under the leadership of the proletariat must be socialism. After expounding the above-mentioned characteristics of the Chinese revolution and its development path, Stalin categorically affirmed that there could not be a Turkish-style revolution that establishes a capitalist society with the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie in China, and sarcastically ridiculed the figures who wanted to play the role of Kemal in China at that time (the first of whom was the bandit Chiang Kai-shek), pointing out that "all this is the dream and illusion of the panic-stricken bourgeoisie" ("Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University"). Stalin's extremely brilliant and wise judgment is the most fundamental idea of his on the Chinese revolution, and it is the essence of his entire theory of the Chinese revolution. It has great guiding significance for the political line of the Chinese Communist Party.
    In the above-mentioned article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" published in 1926 (the same period when Stalin's above-mentioned work was published), Comrade Mao Zedong also made the same conclusion as Stalin on the most fundamental issue of the Chinese revolution, based on the teachings of Lenin and Stalin. Comrade Mao Zedong, with the same categorical tone, determined that the "political proposition" of the Chinese national bourgeoisie to "realize a state ruled by a single class of the national bourgeoisie" was "completely unworkable" in the new world situation after the October Revolution, and emphasized that "the industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution." Later, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, and based on the experience of the Chinese revolution, further developed Stalin's above-mentioned instructions into a complete theory of new democratic revolution under the leadership of the proletariat. The history of the Chinese revolution and its victory over the past two decades eloquently proves that the road of development of the Chinese revolution is precisely the road of the new democratic revolution under the leadership of the proletariat as instructed by Stalin and developed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    In the past, there were two incorrect deviations in our party on the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution, one was leaning to the right, and the other was leaning to the "left." Both of these completely violated Stalin's instructions. Right-wing opportunists, such as Chen Duxiu, regarded the Chinese revolution as an old democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie as the natural leader, and therefore concluded: "The victory of the National Revolution is naturally the victory of the bourgeoisie... Naturally, the bourgeoisie will hold power" ("The Chinese National Revolution and Social Classes" written by Chen Duxiu in 1923), "The future of the Chinese national revolutionary movement... is to achieve the national capitalist construction by revolutionary means" (Resolution of the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the Communist Party of China drafted by Chen Duxiu in 1926); During the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Chen Shaoyu's idea that the Kuomintang could serve as the leader of the Anti-Japanese War, and that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War must be the victory of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang and not the victory of the people, was essentially a rehash of Chen Duxiu's "Old Democratic Revolution Theory." Both of them simply denied the leadership of the proletariat, thereby also denying the socialist future of the Chinese revolution. "Left" opportunists, on the contrary, obliterated the distinction between the two different revolutions of democracy and socialism, and attempted to skip the stage of democratic revolution all at once, and quickly start the socialist revolution, such as the "left" opportunists during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War saying in November 1927 that "the Chinese revolution is a 'continuous revolution,'" and later the so-called "the initial victory of the revolution in one or several provinces," or "the victory of an important part of China" "is the beginning of the revolutionary transformation." The result of this "left" high-pitched empty talk was "more haste, less speed," but instead, it was a head-on collision, thus essentially canceling the possibility of the victory of the democratic revolution under the leadership of the proletariat, thereby also canceling the socialist future.
    (IV)
    In his works, Stalin not only brilliantly judged the nature and future of the Chinese revolution, but also gave many extremely important and valuable instructions on how the Chinese proletariat should lead this revolution so that it could achieve the final victory in accordance with the above-mentioned development direction.
    Stalin first pointed out that the Chinese revolution must be led by the Chinese proletariat, and that the Chinese proletariat must have its own strong party, the Communist Party, to lead the Chinese revolution. This is the primary and decisive condition for the victory of the Chinese revolution. Stalin, in answering the question, "What is required in order for the Chinese proletariat to be able to play the role of leader and guide in the current bourgeois democratic revolution?" instructed: "For this, it is first required that the Chinese Communist Party be a united and solid organization of the Chinese working class, with its own party program, its own political program, its own organization, and its own line." ("Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University")
    What Stalin emphasized here first is precisely the most important experience of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution led by him and Lenin together. Everyone knows that Russia achieved the victory of the October Revolution and the success of socialist construction because it had the Bolshevik Communist Party created by Lenin and Stalin. The Chinese Communist Party was established and developed under the influence of the great October Revolution, taking the Soviet Communist Party as an example and guided by the teachings of Lenin and Stalin. The reason why the great revolution of the Chinese people was able to achieve victory, and thereby open up a broad road from new democracy to socialism, was also because of the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the assistance of international revolutionary forces. The reason why this party can play such a great role in reversing the situation is that, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, it is completely loyal to Marxism-Leninism, an invincible revolutionary science, good at combining it with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and constantly fighting against various anti-Marxist-Leninist ideological trends. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without a revolutionary party built in accordance with the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs... Since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the face of the Chinese revolution has been renewed." ("Unite the Revolutionary Forces of the World to Oppose Imperialist Aggression") This is the key to the earth-shaking great transformation of Chinese history, the key to all the problems of the modern Chinese revolution. It determines the past and present of the Chinese revolution, and also determines the future of the Chinese people's nation-building cause. Secondly, Stalin pointed out that the Chinese proletariat should closely unite the broad working people around itself. Among the working people, Stalin particularly emphasized that peasants are the basic and reliable allies of the proletariat and the basic force of the Chinese revolution. Only by forming a solid worker-peasant alliance can the complete victory of the Chinese revolution be guaranteed. This is the fundamental idea of Stalin's entire theory of the Chinese revolution. It not only stipulates the political line of the Chinese revolution, but also stipulates the tactical line of the Chinese revolution. Stalin, starting from his analysis of the nature of Chinese society and the nature of the revolution, made an extremely full assessment of the role of peasants in the Chinese revolution, because since the rule of feudal landlords over peasants is the basic form of oppression and exploitation in the vast rural areas of China, and imperialism is supporting such oppression and exploitation, the peasant land revolution issue must be the "foundation and content of the bourgeois democratic revolution" in China. ("The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Comintern") The Trotskyite elements denied the existence of feudal forces, and therefore inevitably erased the great significance of the peasant land revolution. Stalin pointed out: "The basic mistake of Trotsky (that is, and the opposition) is to underestimate the Chinese land revolution, not understand the bourgeois democratic nature of this revolution, deny the premise of the land movement participated by millions of Chinese people, and underestimate the role of peasants in the Chinese revolution." (ibid.) Stalin pointed out that this view, like the view that denies the anti-imperialist nature of the Chinese revolution, is the view of the counter-revolutionaries Zhang Zuolin and Chiang Kai-shek. Stalin believed that the peasant issue is an important issue in the Chinese revolution. If the Communists cannot mobilize, organize, and arm millions of peasants and meet their land demands and become their leaders, the revolutionary cause cannot succeed. For this reason, Stalin resolutely demanded in 1927 that "Chinese Communists stand at the forefront of the peasant land movement, teach peasants, especially poor peasants, to organize into revolutionary peasant associations and peasant committees and carry out the cause of confiscating landlord land." ("Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University") Stalin instructed that in addition to uniting the working people, the proletariat must also unite all possible allies around itself in order to form the broadest united front to defeat the main enemy of the current revolution.
    Stalin developed Lenin's idea of "must distinguish between oppressed nations and oppressor nations" and "the proletariat should form a revolutionary alliance with the bourgeois democrats of colonial countries," and clearly affirmed that the Chinese proletariat's tactics of establishing an anti-imperialist united front with the national bourgeoisie were correct and necessary. Because in imperialist countries, "the bourgeoisie is the oppressor of other peoples, and there the bourgeoisie is counter-revolutionary at all stages of the revolution," while in "revolutions in colonies and dependent countries, it is another matter, where the oppression of foreign imperialism is one of the revolutionary factors, where this oppression cannot but also harm the national bourgeoisie, where the national bourgeoisie can support the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement in a certain stage and a certain period" ("The International Situation and the Defense of the Soviet Union").
    The Trotskyite bandits, who were completely ignorant of the actual life in China, erased the anti-imperialist characteristics of the Chinese revolution, thereby foolishly opposing the Chinese proletariat from forming an alliance with the national bourgeoisie that was carrying out the anti-imperialist struggle, and proposed in April 1926 that the Chinese Communists should immediately withdraw from the Kuomintang, which was then an alliance of various revolutionary classes. In refuting the extremely absurd proposition of the Trotskyite elements, Stalin specially emphasized a tactical principle of Leninism, that "the communist party of each country must use the smallest possibility to ensure that the proletariat has a large number of allies, even if they are temporary, wavering, unstable, and unreliable" ("Brief Comments on Current Events"), and accused that the Trotskyite policy undoubtedly helped the enemies of the Chinese revolution, because "now when the entire imperialist gang and all its running dogs are demanding that the Communists be driven out of the Kuomintang, what does it mean for the Communists to withdraw from the Kuomintang? This means abandoning the battlefield, abandoning their allies in the Kuomintang to gain the favor of the enemies of the revolution." ("The Question of the Chinese Revolution")
    However, it would be a big mistake to understand the tactics of the proletariat forming a revolutionary alliance with the national bourgeoisie as the proletariat can abandon its leadership position, thereby turning itself into an appendage of the bourgeoisie. In answering the question, "Should Communists sacrifice their own, even the minimum, even for a minute, of independence in the united front with the national bourgeoisie?" Stalin once said clearly and unambiguously: "No, that is by no means the meaning. The united front only has revolutionary significance in this case and only under this condition, that is, it does not hinder the Communist Party from carrying out its own independent political and organizational work, organizing the proletariat into an independent political force, arousing peasants against landlords, openly organizing workers' and peasants' revolutions, thereby preparing the conditions for the leadership of the proletariat... The Comintern is precisely inspiring the Chinese Communist Party with this view of the united front." ("The International Situation and the Defense of the Soviet Union") For this reason, Stalin suggested that the Chinese Communists, in cooperation with the Kuomintang, must resolutely oppose any attempt by the Kuomintang right-wing, which represents the national big bourgeoisie, to limit the scale of the revolution for the benefit of their own class, and pointed out that if they refuse to obey the discipline of the Kuomintang and betray the interests of the revolution, they should be expelled from the Kuomintang. For the same purpose, Stalin gave the above-mentioned extremely severe criticism in November 1926 to the right-leaning opportunist thought represented by Chen Duxiu, who "feared that the involvement of peasants in the revolution would undermine the united front against imperialism," and emphasized that "immediately meeting the demands of some of the most mature peasants is the most necessary condition for the victory of the Chinese revolution."
    Stalin's brilliant and wise tactical thoughts have extremely important guiding significance for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the Chinese revolution. Based on the tactical principles of Lenin and Stalin, and based on the experience of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong greatly developed Stalin's above-mentioned instructions and formed a complete and correct set of tactics on the united front of the Chinese revolution. During the Anti-Japanese War, based on the experience of the two domestic revolutionary wars, Comrade Mao Zedong brilliantly formulated the tactical line of "developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and isolating anti-Communist die-hard forces," overcoming the vacillation of "left" and right opportunism within the party, thereby greatly developing and strengthening the people's revolutionary forces, weakening and isolating the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries, and cooperating with the assistance of international revolutionary forces to win the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, laying a solid foundation for the later victory of the people's great revolution in the whole country.
    Again, Stalin pointed out that the main form of revolutionary struggle in China is armed struggle. Stalin, starting from the analysis of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society, brilliantly emphasized the special and great significance of armed struggle for the Chinese revolution. When comparing the forms of the outbreak of the Chinese revolution with the revolutions in European countries, Stalin pointed out the following characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution: "In the past, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the revolution always began like this: usually most of the unarmed or poorly armed people rose up, clashed with the army of the old regime, and tried to disintegrate the army of the old regime, or at least partially pull it to their side. This is the typical form of the outbreak of past revolutions... In China, it is not the unarmed people, but the armed people, that is, the revolutionary army, who rose up against the army of the old government. In China, it is the armed revolution against the armed counter-revolution. This is one of the characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution. The special significance of the Chinese revolutionary army also lies in this." ("The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution") The experience of the victory of the Northern Expedition at that time convincingly illustrated this issue. Armed revolution against armed counter-revolution is one of the characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution. The revolutionary army has won a great victory, and the situation has fundamentally changed in favor of the revolution, and the people have the freedom of assembly, strike, publication, and association - this is Stalin's brilliant judgment on the special and great significance of armed struggle under the Chinese warlord rule system. For this reason, Stalin instructed the Chinese Communist Party to pay special attention to the work of building a revolutionary army: "It requires the Chinese Communists to consolidate themselves in the army, revolutionize the army, transform the army, and turn the army from a tool of individual adventurers into a tool of the revolution," and requires "to lay the foundation now for new revolutionary teams and divisions composed of revolutionary peasants and revolutionary workers who have been trained in the land revolution, and to establish some new, truly reliable corps with reliable commanders" ("Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University"). Stalin also called on Chinese Communists to "begin to carefully study military affairs" (ibid.). During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, Chen Duxiu's opportunist leadership completely ignored armed struggle and refused to implement Stalin's instructions on arming the masses and transforming the army, thereby placing the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people in an extremely difficult and dangerous situation with almost no arms after Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei betrayed the revolution. After the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, our party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, faithfully implemented and greatly developed Stalin's instructions, thereby creating the people's revolutionary army, creating rural revolutionary base areas, and finally achieving the great victory of the people's liberation war in the whole country after a long and arduous struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong developed Stalin's view of armed struggle into a complete theory of peasant revolutionary war under the leadership of the proletariat in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China. Finally, Stalin's analysis of the issue of political power in the Chinese revolution gave the Chinese revolution a clear goal. In addition to proposing to the Chinese Communists that they must adopt correct policies towards the Wuhan government, which was still in revolution at that time, Stalin also brilliantly expounded the nature, characteristics, and tasks of the regime that should be established after the victory of the Chinese national liberation movement. In his "Prospects of the Chinese Revolution" published in 1926, Stalin wrote: "I think that the future revolutionary regime in China, in terms of its nature, will be roughly similar to the kind of regime we talked about in 1905..., but there is a difference: this regime will mainly be an anti-imperialist regime. This will be a transitional regime for China to move towards non-capitalist development, or more precisely, towards socialist development. This is the direction in which the Chinese revolution should go." ("The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution") Stalin's brilliant judgment on the future revolutionary regime in China is a conclusion that is logically and inevitably derived from his entire theoretical viewpoint of the Chinese revolution. Stalin's brilliant instruction has great guiding significance for the Chinese Communists to build their own state power. The Chinese revolution over the past two decades has developed in the direction indicated by Stalin. The people's democratic state established as a result of the victory of the Chinese people's great revolution is precisely the type of regime that Stalin had predicted more than 20 years ago. Regarding the nature and characteristics of the people's democratic dictatorship in China, Comrade Mao Zedong gave the following description in his famous essay "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "That is, to unite the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, to form a domestic united front under the leadership of the working class, and to develop from this to establish a state of the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class." "Our current task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus... as a condition to make it possible for China to steadily move from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new democratic society to a socialist society and a communist society, to eliminate classes and realize great harmony, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party." Stalin had high confidence in the future of the victory of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the proletariat. Stalin warned those imperialist robbers, saying: "The power of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable. These forces have not yet been properly expressed. They will be expressed in the future. The rulers of the East and the West do not see these forces and do not estimate these forces to the extent they should, and they will suffer for it." ("The Power of the Chinese Revolution") The victory of the great revolution of the Chinese people and the world-shaking historical event of the expulsion of imperialist robbers from China brilliantly confirmed Stalin's brilliant scientific prediction.
    (V)
    The above-mentioned many fundamental, brilliant, and wise instructions of Stalin on the Chinese revolution have given the Chinese Communist Party great and inestimable help, and it has theoretically armed the Chinese Communist Party. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, following the path instructed by Stalin, have achieved a great revolutionary victory. Stalin made a very high evaluation of the significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution. In his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he called revolutionary China and other people's democratic countries the new "shock troops." The emergence of the new "shock troops" formed by China and the people's democratic countries has changed the situation in which the Soviet Union used to carry out revolutionary shock missions single-handedly, and greatly facilitated the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world. Under Stalin's care, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has been strengthened day by day. In February 1950, China and the Soviet Union, with the participation of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, making the great friendship between the two peoples enter a new stage of unprecedented closeness and unprecedented consolidation. In his telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong on the seventh anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Resistance War, Stalin said: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People' Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a firm bastion of peace in the Far East and the world." The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and various agreements signed in the spirit of this friendship are of great significance for consolidating our country and defending peace in the Far East.
    Stalin was extremely sympathetic and supportive of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea carried out by our people, and believed that victory would certainly belong to the Chinese and Korean side. In answering the question of a Pravda reporter, he said, "If Britain and the United States finally reject the peaceful proposal of the People' Republic of China, the Korean War can only end in the failure of the interventionists."
    While carrying out the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, our people are carrying out the great work of economic recovery and construction. Stalin and the Soviet government and the Soviet people under his leadership gave great help to our country's economic construction. Stalin was the first to point out that China must develop its own heavy industry. He once said: "China has been ravaged by all those who are willful because it does not have its own heavy industry and its own military industry" ("Summary of the First Five-Year Plan"). The Soviet Union and our country signed loan and trade agreements, providing us with first-class industrial equipment and various construction materials, and at our request, sent experts to help us with construction, imparting to us the Soviet Union's advanced construction experience and advanced science and technology. These generous and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union greatly accelerated the speed of our country's construction.
    Stalin was the greatest Marxist after Lenin's death, and the greatest leader and teacher of the working people all over the world. Stalin has passed away and bid farewell to us forever. But although Stalin is dead, his spirit will last forever. Stalin's brilliant teachings, Stalin's invincible scientific thought will forever radiate brilliant light and continue to guide us to advance victoriously and complete the cause he left to us.
    The great Stalin will be immortal!

    斯大林对中国革命理论的伟大贡献
    ——为追悼斯大林同志逝世而作
  　张如心

    伟大的斯大林逝世了，这是马克思、恩格斯、列宁逝世以后，全世界的工人阶级和被压迫人民最沉重的和无可补偿的损失。在这哀痛的日子里，人们很自然地回忆着斯大林的过去，感激斯大林对全人类的伟大贡献。作为列宁的最好战友、列宁逝世以后最伟大的马克思主义者的斯大林，对苏联人民、对全世界被压迫人民的贡献是非常之大的。我们中国共产党人和中国人民尤其感觉亲切的与永志不忘的是这位巨人对中国人民的特别关怀和对中国革命理论的伟大贡献。
    伟大的斯大林一贯地是中国人民解放事业热情的鼓舞者和天才的导师。远在一九一八年，即我国五四运动的前一年，斯大林即强调指出东方被压迫民族解放运动的伟大国际意义，并发出了“不能忘记东方”的号召。以后中国革命在中国共产党领导之下每一步的前进都引起了斯大林的注意和欢呼。一九二五年斯大林在他的一次讲演中曾指出了“中国革命运动的力量是不可计量的”。在一九二四—一九二七年间，受苦受难的中国人民在中国共产党领导下，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，向着吃人的野兽——帝国主义封建军阀开展革命进攻的时候，斯大林和他领导下的苏联人民以极大的热情支持和鼓舞了中国人民的革命斗争。为了粉碎托洛茨基派关于中国革命的胡说，为了在中国革命的许多带根本性质的问题上给与中国共产党以马克思列宁主义的理论武装，以促进中国革命的胜利，斯大林在这一时期写了许多关于中国革命问题的著作，把列宁主义的民族殖民地革命理论推进到新的阶段。
    斯大林在一九二四——一九二七年中国第一次国内革命战争时期所写的关于中国革命的不朽著作，主要的有“论中国革命的前途”、“中国革命问题”、“论中国革命的几个问题”、“与中山大学学生的谈话”、“中国革命与共产国际的任务”、“时事问题简评”、“国际形势与苏联国防”中关于中国问题部分，“论反对派在中国三个问题上的政治面目”。斯大林在这许多著作中，用马克思列宁主义的科学观点深刻地阐述了在十月社会主义革命以后的世界革命的新时代，在苏联社会主义建设与资本主义总危机继续尖锐化的条件下发展着的中国革命的一系列的问题，并对于共产党人在这一革命中应采取的政治路线和战略策略给予了许多极其天才英明的指示。斯大林这许多不朽的著作是对马克思列宁主义理论宝库的伟大贡献，它对于中国革命起了极大的指导作用。二十多年来的中国革命正是在毛泽东同志的领导下遵循着斯大林的指示而获得胜利的。
    （二）
    斯大林对于中国革命的政治路线与战略策略的规定，是以他对中国社会的经济、政治情况和阶级关系的具体分析为依据的。斯大林指明了旧中国是帝国主义列强统治与宰割下的半殖民地。斯大林在一九二七年驳斥托洛茨基匪徒所谓“中国民族革命主要是反关税的革命”的谬论时，曾这样说：“帝国主义在中国的力量主要地不在于对中国关税的限制，而在于它在中国握有从中国好多百万工人和农民身上吸取血汗的工厂、矿山、铁路、轮船、银行、洋行。”（“时事问题简评”）
    斯大林揭露了帝国主义在旧中国的统治是与旧中国国内反动腐朽的封建势力密切地结合着的，并一再地强调封建地主对农民的剥削，仍是中国广大农村压迫的基本形式。斯大林说：“如果好些省份内农民收入百分之七十是属于地主和劣绅；如果武装的或没有武装的地主不但是经济的而且是行政的和司法的权力；如果直到现在一些省份里还实行着中世纪的买卖妇女和小孩的事情——那末不能不承认封建残余是中国各省压迫的基本形式。”（“中国革命与共产国际的任务”）托洛茨基匪徒拉狄克当时曾经以“商业资本渗入了中国农村，并把土地出租给贫苦农民”为理由来否定中国农村中封建势力的存在。斯大林在戳穿拉狄克这种胡说八道时，曾深刻地揭示了中国商业资本的特性和它与封建势力的关系，他说：“中国农村里是不是存在着商业资本呢？是的，是存在着，不仅存在着，而且从农民身上吸取血汗并不亚于任何封建主。可是这种原始积累类型的商业资本在中国乡村中是与封建主的统治，与地主的统治独特地结合在一起的，它从地主那里抄袭了中世纪的剥削和压迫农民的方法。……这就是问题之所在”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）。
    斯大林对于建立在这种半封建半殖民地的经济基础上面的政治上层建筑作了下列的科学判断：
    “中国现在的惨无人道地掠夺和压迫中国农民的整个军阀官僚机构，本质上就是封建残余和封建剥削方法的统治同乡村商人资本的存在之这种结合上面的政治上层建筑物”（“时事问题简评”），“军阀统治，督军、省长以及现在一切残酷和掠夺的军事的与非军事的官僚，都是中国这种独特性上面的上层建筑。帝国主义正支持和巩固着这整个封建官僚机构”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）。
    大家都知道：我国一九一一年辛亥革命失败以后，代替满清封建王朝而统治中国人民的，正是斯大林所指出的以北洋军阀为中心的反动腐朽的封建军阀官僚机构，而第一次国内革命战争失败后建立起来的国民党反动派的统治，则是封建买办法西斯主义政权。这种建立在半封建的经济基础上面的政治上层建筑——军阀官僚统治制度，一方面是国内的封建地主阶级的政治代表，另一方面又与外国帝国主义密切地结合着而成为他们在中国统治的代理人。正是这种反动腐朽的封建军阀官僚统治制度巩固和加强了封建势力的剥削与压迫，并给帝国主义对中国的侵略和统治充当了清道夫，使中国人民生活日益恶化，民族危机日益加深。
    （三）
    在对于中国社会性质和特点进行深刻的马克思主义的分析的基础上，斯大林判定了中国现阶段的革命是反封建和反帝国主义的资产阶级民主革命。斯大林说：“中国资产阶级民主革命不仅是反对封建残余。它同时还反对帝国主义。”“中国现在的革命，便是两个革命运动——反封建残余的运动和反帝国主义的运动——巨流的汇合。”（“中国革命与共产国际的任务”）
    斯大林关于中国革命性质这种天才英明的论断，彻底粉碎了托洛茨基匪徒否认中国革命反帝反封建性质的胡说，同时也给当时中国共产党内的陈独秀机会主义一个有力的警告。陈独秀在第一次国内革命战争时期的主要错误观点之一，就是只看到了中国革命的反帝国主义的一面，而完全漠视了中国革命的反封建的一面，因而可耻地阻碍了农民土地革命的开展，这是第一次国内革命战争失败的主观原因之一。斯大林当时曾经极严厉地抨击了这种机会主义观点，他说：“我知道，在国民党人中间，甚至在共产党人中间，有些人不认为展开农村革命是可能的，害怕农民卷入革命就会破坏反帝国主义的统一战线。同志们，这是大错特错。中国农民卷入革命愈快愈彻底，中国反帝国主义的统一战线就愈有力和愈强大。”（“论中国革命的前途”）
    我们党的伟大领袖、斯大林的忠实学生和战友——毛泽东同志在第一次国内战争时期，即站在列宁斯大林的立场上坚决地反对了陈独秀机会主义，积极地支持了农民运动，以深入和贯彻反帝国主义的斗争。以后在中国革命的各个时期中又忠实地执行了斯大林这一天才指示，正确地把握了中国革命两大巨流的辩证关系，领导中国革命取得了彻底的胜利。
    斯大林在全面地论述中国革命的性质和特征时，曾着重地强调了中国革命的下列三个极其重要的特点：
    “第一个特点就是：中国革命是资产阶级民主革命，同时也是民族解放革命，其刀锋是对准着外国帝国主义在中国的统治。这便是它与一九○五年俄国革命首先不同的地方。……因此，中国革命是与各国无产者反帝国主义的革命直接衔接着的。”
    第二个特点是：“民族大资产阶级在中国是极端软弱和落后的，他们较之一九○五年时期的俄国资产阶级更软弱得无比。”“但是由此可以得出结论说：中国革命倡导者和领导者的作用，中国农民领袖的作用，必不可免地要落在中国无产阶级及其政党手中。”（“论中国革命的前途”）
    第三个特点是“在中国旁边，还有苏联存在着和发展着，它的革命经验和帮助不能不促进中国无产阶级反对帝国主义和反对中国中世纪封建残余的斗争”（“论中国革命的前途”）。
    斯大林这里所强调的中国革命的几个特点，对中国革命的整个发展方向有决定的意义，因为中国革命既然不是普通的资产阶级革命而是带着上述诸特点的民族民主革命，那末很显然的，中国革命发展的道路和前途将必然是如斯大林所预见的：“或者民族资产阶级击破无产阶级，与帝国主义勾结，共同进攻革命，……；或者无产阶级把民族资产阶级挤在一边，巩固自己的领导权，率领城乡千百万劳动群众以克服民族资产阶级的反抗，取得资产阶级民主革命底完全胜利，然后把它逐渐转移到社会主义革命底轨道上，伴有由此产生底一切后果。”（“中国革命问题”）斯大林接着更补充指明：“世界资本主义的危机及苏联无产阶级专政的存在——这一专政的经验中国无产阶级可以顺利地利用——大大地便利于中国革命第二条道路实现的可能性。”“所以共产党人的基本任务是在于为中国革命第二条道路的胜利而斗争”（同上）。
    这样斯大林便明确地断定了中国革命是一种新型的资产阶级民主革命，它生长在十月社会主义革命以后的世界无产阶级革命的新时代，因此，它是世界无产阶级革命的一部分，它的领导权必须属于无产阶级，而无产阶级领导下的资产阶级民主革命的前途必然是社会主义。在阐述了中国革命上述诸特点及其发展道路之后，斯大林便斩钉截铁地肯定了中国不可能有建立资产阶级专政的资本主义社会的土耳其式的革命，并辛辣地嘲笑了中国当时想扮演基马尔角色的人物（其中第一个就是匪徒蒋介石），指出“这一切都是惊惶失措的资产阶级的梦想和幻觉”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）。斯大林这一极端英明天才的论断是他对中国革命问题的一个最根本的思想，是他全部中国革命理论的精粹，它对于中国共产党的政治路线有极大的指导意义。
    毛泽东同志在上述的一九二六年（即斯大林上述著作发表的同一时期）发表的“中国社会各阶级的分析”一文中，对中国革命这一最根本的问题，也根据列宁斯大林的学说，作出了与斯大林相同的论断。毛泽东同志以同样斩钉截铁的语气，断定了中国民族资产阶级“实现民族资产阶级一阶级统治的国家”的“政治主张”，在十月革命以后崭新的世界局势之下，是“完全行不通的”，并着重地强调了“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。”后来毛泽东同志根据列宁斯大林的学说，根据中国革命的经验，又把斯大林上述的指示进一步地发展成为完整的无产阶级领导的新民主主义的革命理论。二十多年来中国革命及其胜利的历史雄辩地证明，中国革命发展的道路正是斯大林所指示的又为毛泽东同志所发展的无产阶级领导的新民主主义革命的道路。
    过去我们党内在中国革命的根本问题上存在过两种不正确的偏向，一种是向右边歪的，另一种是向“左”边歪的，这两者都是完全违反了斯大林的指示。右倾机会主义者，如陈独秀是把中国革命看作以资产阶级为天然领导者领导下的旧民主主义革命，因而断定：“国民革命的胜利，自然是资产阶级的胜利……自然是资产阶级握得政权”（陈独秀一九二三年写的“中国国民革命与社会各阶级”），“中国民族革命运动的前途……是以革命手段达到民族的资本主义之建设”（陈独秀一九二六年起草的中国共产党第三次中央扩大执行委员会议决议案）；抗日战争时期陈绍禹同志的认为国民党可以充当抗日战争的领导者、抗日战争的胜利必然是蒋介石国民党的胜利而不能是人民的胜利的思想，实质上是陈独秀的“旧民主主义革命论”的翻版。两者都干脆地否认了无产阶级的领导权，从而也否认了中国革命的社会主义前途。“左”倾机会主义者则相反，抹杀了民主主义和社会主义这两种不同的革命的区别，企图一下子跳过民主革命的阶段，很快地开始社会主义革命，如第二次国内革命战争时期的“左”倾机会主义者在一九二七年十一月的“中国革命是‘不断革命’”的说法，以及后来所谓“一省几省革命首先胜利”，或者“中国重要部分的胜利”“就是革命转变的开始”的论调。这种“左”倾高调空喊的结果是“欲速则不达”，反而碰得头破血流，因而实质上也是取消了无产阶级领导下的民主革命胜利的可能性，从而也取消了社会主义的前途。
    （四）
    斯大林在他的著作中不仅天才地论断了中国革命的性质及其前途，而且对于中国无产阶级应该如何去领导这一革命使之能够按照上述的发展方向取得最后的胜利，也给与了许多极端重要和宝贵的指示。
    斯大林首先指出中国革命必须要由中国无产阶级来领导，而中国无产阶级要领导中国革命就必须有自己的坚强的政党——共产党，这是中国革命胜利的首要的并且带有决定意义的条件。斯大林在回答“为了使中国无产阶级在当前资产阶级民主革命中便于起领袖作用、领导者作用，则要求些什么呢？”的问题时指示说：“为了这个，首先要求中国共产党是中国工人阶级的团结坚固的组织，有自己的党纲，有自己的政纲，有自己的组织，有自己的路线。”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）
    斯大林在这里所首先强调的正是他和列宁一起领导的十月社会主义革命胜利的一条最主要的经验。大家都知道：俄国因为有了列宁、斯大林所缔造的布尔什维主义的共产党，因此取得了十月革命的胜利与社会主义建设的成功。中国共产党是在伟大的十月革命的影响下，以苏联共产党为榜样，以列宁斯大林的学说为指南建立起来和发展起来的无产阶级政党。中国人民大革命之所以能够取得胜利，并由此而开辟了从新民主主义向着社会主义前进的康庄大道，也是因为有了以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的坚强领导并获得国际革命力量的援助所得到的结果。而这个党之所以能够起这样扭转乾坤的伟大作用，就是因为它在毛泽东同志领导之下，完全忠实于马克思列宁主义这一无敌的革命科学，善于把它与中国革命的具体实践结合起来，并不断地和各种各色的反马克思列宁主义的思想流派进行斗争。毛泽东同志说：“没有一个按照马、恩、列、斯的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级及广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。……自从有了中国共产党，中国革命的面貌就焕然一新了。”（“全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略”）这是中国历史天翻地覆大转变的关键，是现代中国革命一切问题的关键，它决定了中国革命的过去和现在，同时也决定今后中国人民的建国事业的将来。其次，斯大林指出，中国无产阶级应该将广大的劳动人民紧紧地团结在自己的周围。在劳动人民中间，斯大林特别强调农民是无产阶级的基本的可靠的同盟者，是中国革命的基本队伍，必须形成巩固的工农联盟，才能保障中国革命的彻底胜利，这是斯大林全部中国革命理论的根本思想。它不仅规定着中国革命的政治路线，而且也规定着中国革命的策略路线。斯大林从他对中国社会性质与革命性质的分析出发，对农民在中国革命中的作用作了极其充分的估计，因为封建地主对农民的统治既然是中国广大农村压迫和剥削的基本形式，而帝国主义又在支持着这样压迫和剥削，那末农民土地革命问题必然是中国“资产阶级民主革命的基础和内容”。（“中国革命与共产国际的任务”）托洛茨基分子因为否认封建势力的存在，因而也就必然抹杀农民土地革命的重大意义。斯大林曾指出：“托洛茨基（也就是说，和反对派）的基本错误是在于过低估计中国土地革命，不懂得这个革命的资产阶级民主性质，否认中国千百万人所参加的土地运动的前提，过低估计农民在中国革命中的作用。”（同上）斯大林指出，这种观点与否认中国革命的反帝国主义性质的观点一样，乃是反革命的张作霖与蒋介石的观点。斯大林认为农民问题是中国革命的重要问题，共产党人如果不能把千百万的农民发动起来、组织起来、武装起来并满足他们的土地要求而成为他们的领袖，革命事业就不可能成功。为此，斯大林在一九二七年曾坚决要求“中国共产党人站在农民土地运动的最前列，教导农民、尤其是贫农组织到革命的农民协会和农民委员会去并进行没收地主土地的事业。”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）斯大林指示，除了团结劳动人民以外，无产阶级还必须团结一切可能的同盟者在自己的周围，以便形成最广泛的统一战线来战胜当前革命的主要敌人。
    斯大林发展了列宁的“必须区别被压迫民族与压迫民族”以及“无产阶级应当与殖民地国家的资产阶级民主派订立革命联盟”的思想，明确地肯定了中国无产阶级与民族资产阶级建立反帝国主义统一战线的策略是正确的和必要的。因为帝国主义国家里的“资产阶级是别国人民的压迫者，在那里资产阶级在革命的一切阶段上都是反革命的”，而在“殖民地和附属国里的革命，则是另一回事情，在那里别国帝国主义的压迫是革命因素之一，在那里这种压迫不能不也损害民族资产阶级，在那里民族资产阶级在某一阶段上和某一时期内可以支持本国反帝国主义的革命运动”（“国际形势与苏联国防”）。
    对中国实际生活完全无知的托洛茨基匪徒抹杀了中国革命的反帝国主义的特点，从而愚蠢地反对中国无产阶级与正在进行反对帝国主义的民族资产阶级订立联盟，并在一九二六年四月提出中国共产党人应该立即退出当时还是各个革命阶级联盟的国民党的主张。斯大林在驳斥托洛茨基分子这种极端荒唐的主张时，曾特别强调列宁主义的一条策略原则，即“每个国家的共产党务须要利用极小的可能以保证无产阶级有大批同盟者，即使是暂时的、动摇的、不坚固的、不可靠的”（“时事问题简评”），并指责了托洛茨基派这种政策无疑地是帮助了中国革命的敌人，因为“现在当整个帝国主义匪帮及其一切走狗要求把共产党人赶出国民党的时候，共产党退出国民党是什么意思呢？这就是说，放弃战场，抛弃自己在国民党内的同盟者以取得革命敌人的欢心。”（“中国革命问题”
    但是，如果把无产阶级与民族资产阶级订立革命联盟的策略了解为无产阶级可以放弃自己的领导地位，从而把自己变成资产阶级的附属物，那就大错而特错了。斯大林在回答“共产党人在与民族资产阶级的统一战线中是否应当牺牲自己的、即使是最小限度的、即使是一分钟的独立性呢？”的问题时，曾经这样明确地毫不含糊地说：“不，决不是这个意思。统一战线只是在这种场合下而且只是在这种条件下才具有革命的意义，即它不妨害共产党去进行自己独立的政治和组织的工作，把无产阶级组织为独立的政治力量，唤起农民反对地主，公开地组织工农革命，从而准备无产阶级领导权的条件……共产国际正是以这种统一战线观来启示中国共产党的。”（“国际形势与苏联国防”）为此，斯大林建议中国共产党人在与国民党合作中，必须坚决反对代表民族大资产阶级的国民党右派为了本阶级的利益而限制革命规模的任何企图，并指出如果他们拒绝服从国民党的纪律和叛卖革命的利益，则应当把他们逐出国民党。为了同样的目的，斯大林在一九二六年十一月对以陈独秀为代表的“害怕农民卷入革命就会破坏反帝国主义的统一战线”的右倾机会主义思想，给予了上述极严厉的抨击，并强调“立即满足一些最成熟的农民要求是中国革命胜利的最必要的条件”。
    斯大林这些天才英明的策略思想对于中国共产党领导中国革命有极其重大的指导意义。毛泽东同志根据列宁斯大林的策略原则，根据中国革命的经验，把斯大林上述的指示极大地发展了，并形成一套关于中国革命统一战线的完整的正确的策略。在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志根据两次国内革命战争的经验，英明地制定了“发展进步势力，争取中间势力，孤立反共顽固势力”的策略路线，克服了党内“左”右倾机会主义的摇摆，因而大大地发展了和壮大了人民革命势力，削弱了和孤立了蒋介石国民党反动派，并配合国际革命势力的援助，取得了抗日战争的胜利，为后来人民大革命在全国的胜利奠定了稳固的基础。
    再次，斯大林指出了中国革命斗争的主要形式是武装斗争。斯大林从对中国半殖民地半封建社会性质分析出发，英明地强调了武装斗争对于中国革命的特殊重大意义。斯大林在比较中国革命与欧洲各国革命的爆发形式时，曾指出中国革命的下列的特点和优点：“从前，在十八和十九世纪，革命总是这样开始的：通常是大部分没有武装或武装很坏的人民举行起义，与旧政权的军队发生冲突，力谋瓦解旧政权的军队，或者至少部分地把它拉到自己方面来。这是过去革命爆发的典型形式……。在中国，不是那没有武装的人民，而是武装的人民，即革命军队，起来反对旧政府的军队。在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。中国革命的特点之一和优点之一就在于此。中国革命军队的特殊意义也正在于此。”（“论中国革命的前途”）当时北伐战争胜利的经验，令人信服地说明了这个问题。武装的革命反对武装的反革命是中国革命底特点和优点之一，革命军队打了大胜仗，情况就根本改变而有利于革命，人民就有集会、罢工、出版、结社的自由——这就是斯大林关于武装斗争在中国军阀统治制度下有特殊重大意义的天才论断。为此，斯大林指示中国共产党应该特别注意建立革命军队的工作：“要求中国共产党人在军队中巩固起来，使军队革命化，改造军队，把军队从个别冒险分子的工具变成革命的工具”，要求“现在要奠定从受过土地革命锻炼的革命农民及革命工人所组成的新的革命团队和师团的基础，成立一些新的、真正可靠的、拥有可靠的指挥人员的军团”（“与中山大学学生的谈话”）。斯大林并且号召中国共产党人“应当着手精密地研究军事”（同上）。在第一次国内革命战争时期，陈独秀的机会主义领导是完全漠视了武装斗争，拒绝执行斯大林关于武装群众、改造军队的指示，因而使中国共产党与中国人民在蒋介石汪精卫叛变革命以后处于几乎完全没有武装的极端困难和危急的境况中。在第一次国内革命战争失败以后，我们的党在毛泽东同志领导下面，忠实地执行了并大大地发展了斯大林的指示，从而创造了人民革命的军队，创造了农村的革命根据地并经过长期的艰苦的斗争终于取得人民解放战争在全国范围内的伟大胜利。毛泽东同志把斯大林的武装斗争的观点发展成为半殖民地半封建中国无产阶级领导下的农民革命战争的完整理论。最后，斯大林关于中国革命政权问题的分析，使中国革命具有了明确的目标。斯大林除了向中国共产党人提出必须对当时尚在革命的武汉政府采取正确的政策之外，还天才地阐述了中国民族解放运动胜利以后，应当建立的政权的性质、特点和任务的问题。斯大林在其一九二六年发表的“论中国革命前途”一文中，这样写着：“我以为，中国未来的革命政权，就其性质讲来，大体上将类似我们在一九○五年所说的那种政权……，然而有一个差别：这个政权主要将是反帝国主义的政权。这将是中国走向非资本主义发展，或者更确切些说，走向社会主义发展的过渡政权。这就是中国革命所应当走的方向。”（“论中国革命的前途”）斯大林对于中国未来的革命政权的天才论断是从他的中国革命全部理论观点逻辑上必然得出的结论。斯大林这一天才指示对中国共产党人建设自己的国家政权有极大的指导意义。二十多年来的中国革命正是朝着斯大林所指示的方向发展的。中国人民大革命胜利的结果所建立的人民民主国家正是斯大林二十多年前所预料的那种类型的政权。关于中国人民民主专政的性质和特点，毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”的著名论文中曾有下列的描述：“这就是团结工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，在工人阶级领导之下，结成国内的统一战线，并由此发展到建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家”。“我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，……以此作为条件，使中国有可能在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会与共产主义社会，消灭阶级和实现大同。”斯大林对无产阶级领导下的中国革命胜利的前途有高度的信心。斯大林警告那些帝国主义强盗说：“中国革命运动的力量是不可计量的。这些力量还没有恰当地表现出来。它们将来还会表现出来。东方和西方的统治者看不到这些力量，不以应有的程度估计到这些力量，他们将因此而吃苦头。”（“中国革命的力量”）中国人民大革命的胜利与帝国主义强盗被逐出中国这一震撼全世界的历史事件辉煌地证实了斯大林的天才的科学预见。
    （五）
    上述斯大林关于中国革命的许多带根本性质的天才英明的指示，给了中国共产党人以极大的无可估量的帮助，它在理论上武装了中国共产党。中国人民在中国共产党领导下，按照斯大林指示的道路，取得了伟大的革命胜利。斯大林对于中国革命胜利的意义，作了极高的估价。他在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说中，把革命胜利了的中国和其他人民民主国家，称为新的“突击队”。中国和各人民民主国家形成的新“突击队”的出现，改变了苏联过去单枪匹马地执行革命突击任务的局面，大大地便利了世界各国人民的革命斗争。在斯大林的关怀下，中苏两国人民的友谊日益加强起来。一九五○年二月，中苏两国在斯大林同志和毛泽东同志的参加下签订了友好同盟互助条约，使两国人民的伟大友谊进到了一个新的空前亲密空前巩固的阶段。斯大林在抗日战争胜利七周年致毛泽东同志的电文中说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”本着这种友谊精神所签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约和各个协定，对于巩固我们的国家和保卫远东和平的事业具有巨大的意义。
    斯大林对于我国人民进行的抗美援朝运动，极为同情和支持，并相信胜利一定属于中国和朝鲜方面。他答复真理报记者的问题时说：“如果英国和美国终于拒绝了中国人民政府的和平建议，那么朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”
    我国人民一面进行抗美援朝的斗争，一面进行经济的恢复和建设的巨大工作。斯大林和他所领导的苏联政府和苏联人民，对于我国的经济建设给予了极大的帮助。斯大林是最早指出中国必须发展自己的重工业的人。他曾说过：“中国因为没有自己的重工业，没有自己的军事工业，而被一切逞性妄为的人所蹂躏着”（“第一个五年计划的总结”）。苏联和我国签订了贷款和贸易的协定，供给我们头等的工业装备和各种建设器材，并应我国之请求，派遣专家帮助我们进行建设，将苏联先进的建设经验和先进的科学技术传授给我们。苏联这些慷慨无私的援助，大大地加速了我国建设的速度。
    斯大林是列宁逝世以后最伟大的马克思主义者，是全世界劳动人民最伟大的领袖和导师。斯大林逝世了，他和我们永别了。但斯大林虽死，而他的精神却将永存。斯大林的天才学说，斯大林的攻无不克、战无不胜的科学思想将永远地放射着灿烂的光芒，继续引导我们胜利地前进，去完成他遗留给我们的事业。
    伟大的斯大林永垂不朽！
