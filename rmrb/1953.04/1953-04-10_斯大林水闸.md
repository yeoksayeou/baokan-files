    Stalin Dam

    The Iskar River is the second largest river in Bulgaria. It rushes from the vast Lilla Plain through the canyons of the Plana and Roson Mountains, meanders across the Sofia Plain, then divides into tributaries, flows through the Balkan Mountains, irrigates the northern regions of Bulgaria, and finally merges with the quiet Danube River.
    In the past, the stone embankments on both sides of the Iskar River, near the Plana Mountains, were desolate and silent.

    On November 25, 1950, the Bulgarian Council of Ministers and the Bulgarian Communist Party jointly issued a decision to harness the waters of the Iskar River for the people, to build a large dam, and to establish three huge hydroelectric power stations in Basaril, Kokalyan, and Sofia. This series of construction projects is the largest hydroelectric construction project in the Balkan Peninsula.

    The great dam, named after the great Stalin, will stretch into the granite on both sides of the Iskar River, horizontally inserted between the mountains. It will be 76 meters high, 200 meters long at the top, and 62 meters wide at the base. This dam will control the turbulent waters of the Iskar River. To make the dam stable and able to withstand the river water, it is necessary to excavate and remove 75,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, and pour 190,000 cubic meters of concrete. After the dam is built, the waters of the Iskar River will gather into a beautiful lake, capable of storing 620 million cubic meters of water.

    In the ancient myths and legends of Bulgaria, there is a saying that in order to make the houses, walls, or other buildings that are built strong and permanent, a young bride must be buried at the bottom. The Stalin Dam and its reservoir lake, such a huge construction project, is not a myth but a real thing in the lives of the Bulgarian people. It does not require a young bride to be its sacrifice, as in myths, but it will swallow three small villages. In the future, after these three villages are relocated, on the surface of the reservoir lake, there will appear white sails and fast yachts, and joyful songs will ripple with the blue waves of the lake. Along the lake shore, housing will be built for the working people to rest and recuperate; the highest peak in the Balkan Peninsula—Stalin Peak—will be reflected in the clear lake water. The labor of the Bulgarian people will turn this desolate mountain wilderness into a scenic place.

    The water in the reservoir lake will be transformed into electricity, for use in nearby factories, enterprises, and farmhouses. A portion of the river water will flow through a five-and-a-half-kilometer tunnel to the village of Basaril, pouring down from a height of 118 meters, turning the turbines of the Basaril power station, and generating 26,000 kilowatts of electricity. Then, the river water will flow through another shorter tunnel to Kokalyan village, enabling the power station there to generate 22,000 kilowatts of electricity.

    After passing through Basaril and Kokalyan, the waters of the Iskar River continue to advance, converging into a small lake in the village of Pancharevo, eleven kilometers from Sofia. On its banks, there have long been many mineral springs. Now, many modern lakeside bathing areas, villas, and sanatoriums will be built there.

    From Pancharevo onward, there is a canal as wide as 38 meters. The end of the canal's tributary is Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. In the future, Sofia will become a 20-kilometer-long port, and the river water here will enable the Sofia power station to generate 9,000 kilowatts of electricity. Together with the two power stations mentioned earlier, it will supply 57,000 kilowatts of electricity to the whole country, a figure equal to the total power generation of Bulgaria in 1947.

    The waters of the Iskar River, flowing through the Sofia Plain, will irrigate 144,000 acres of land. In the past, these areas were often dry and barren due to lack of water, and no crops grew. A canal, a total of 6,500 meters long, like a large belt, surrounds the Sofia Plain, extending to its most remote corners. Many pumping stations along the canal will transport river water to water-deficient fields.

    In the middle of the circular canal, Sofia will become even more beautiful. Its natural environment will be greatly changed, and the entire city will become an ocean of flowers and greenery.

    The Stalin Dam and other construction projects are already underway in full swing. Trucks loaded with construction materials are busily running along the slopes of the Plana Mountains and the stone embankments of the Iskar River, steam compactors and stone rollers are rumbling, the sound of gunpowder explosions is deafening, and the sounds of labor and metal and stone have long broken the silence of the valley. A great battle between man and nature is fiercely underway.

    In the Plana Mountains, tunnels are being excavated. The first tunnel has already been excavated for two kilometers and steel-reinforced concrete has been laid. Strong people have entered the interior of the rock, transporting countless rubble from the inside in trains, and sending concrete mixed with water, supports, and a large amount of wood into the tunnel. The places where the bravest young shock brigades are working are called the Korean Front. This symbolic statement is no exaggeration. In the pitch-black caves where you can't see your fingers, the air is turbid and suffocating, and people can easily be attacked by rocks and injured if they are not careful. Water droplets from the rock walls soak their clothes. People without a strong will and a determination to work hard for the construction of the motherland can hardly stay here for even a quarter of an hour. But the young people have not stopped their work, they continue their arduous labor, determined to pierce the belly of the mountain and build a tunnel for water. Not long ago, the builders of the Stalin Dam held a conference with gratitude to welcome machines from the Soviet Union. Indeed, without the powerful and various machines supplied by the Soviet Union, it would be unimaginable to carry out such a huge construction project. Now, 90 percent of the work on the construction site has been mechanized, even the excavation and transportation work. It is precisely because of the large-scale use of Soviet machines that 65,000 cubic meters of rock have been excavated and removed in a short period of time, and the concrete pouring work of the dam has begun not long ago.

    Everyone working on the dam construction site deeply feels Comrade Stalin's concern for the Bulgarian people's construction of a new life. They are all determined to build this dam, named after the great teacher, quickly and firmly. Mountain workers, crane and hoist operators, excavators, concrete workers, and young shock brigade members are all learning to overcome the difficulties in their work with Comrade Stalin's fearless spirit of overcoming difficulties. Under their efforts, the Stalin Dam will be completed in 1955, and the three hydroelectric power stations will begin to generate electricity. By that time, the light of freedom and happiness, linked to Stalin's immortal name, will shine on the vast mountains and villages of Bulgaria.

### 斯大林水闸

    斯大林水闸
    伊斯克尔河是保加利亚境内的第二条大河。它从广大的利拉平原冲过普兰纳山和罗松山的峡谷，在索非亚平原徐徐行进，然后分成支流，通过巴尔干的山脉，灌溉了保加利亚的北部地区，而后与静静的多瑙河汇流。
    从前，在伊斯克尔河的石堤两岸，在普兰纳山的附近，是荒凉而静寂的。
    一九五○年十一月二十五日，保加利亚部长会议与保加利亚共产党联合发布了一项决定，要使伊斯克尔河的河水为人民服务，建设一个大水闸，并在巴萨利尔、柯卡利扬与索非亚三地建立三个巨大的水电站。这一系列的建设工程是巴尔干半岛上最大的水电建设工程。
    这个冠以伟大斯大林的名字的大水闸，将伸展到伊斯克尔河两岸的花岗岩里，横插在山腰之间。它的高度为七十六公尺，上面的长度是二百公尺，底层宽达六十二公尺。这个水闸将要控制住汹涌澎湃的伊斯克尔河的河水。为了使水闸稳固而足以挡住河水，必须挖掘与移走七万五千立方公尺的泥土和石块，并要浇灌十九万立方公尺的混凝土。水闸建立起来以后，伊斯克尔河的河水将要聚汇成一个美丽的湖泊，能蓄水六亿二千万立方公尺。
    在保加利亚的古老的神话和传说里，有这样的说法：为了使建造起来的房屋、城墙或别的建筑物坚固永存，要把一个年轻的新娘埋在底层。斯大林水闸和它的蓄水湖这样巨大的建设工程，不是神话而是保加利亚人民生活中的真实的事情，它不像神话里那样要求年轻的新娘来做它的祭品，但却要吞没三个小小的乡村。到将来，在这三个乡村迁移以后，也就是在那个蓄水湖的湖面上，将出现点点白帆和快速的游艇，欢乐的歌声将随着湖水的碧波荡漾开去。湖滨沿岸，将要兴建起供给劳动人民休养的住所；巴尔干半岛上最高的山峰——斯大林山峰，就要倒映在清澈的湖水里。保加利亚人民的劳动，将使这个荒凉的山野变成风光绮丽的地方。
    蓄水湖里的水将要变成电力，供给附近的工厂企业和农家应用。一部分河水通过一条五公里半的隧道，流至巴萨利尔乡村，从一百一十八公尺的高度上倾泻下来，转动巴萨利尔电力站的涡轮，发出两万六千瓩的电力。然后，河水又流经另一条较短的隧道，通往柯卡利扬村，使那里的电力站发出两万二千瓩电力。
    经过巴萨利尔和柯卡利扬两地以后，伊斯克尔河的河水又继续前进，在离索非亚十一公里的潘查列伏村汇成一个小湖。在它的岸上，很早以来就存着许多矿泉。现在就要在那里建造起许多现代化的湖滨浴场、别墅和休养所来。
    自潘查列伏再向前，是一条宽达三十八公尺的运河。运河支流的尽头就是保加利亚的首都索非亚。将来，索非亚要变成一个二十公里长的港口，这里的河水将使索非亚电力站发出九千瓩的电力。它和前面提到的两个电力站一起，将供应全国五万七千瓩的电力，这个数字等于一九四七年保加利亚全国的总发电量。
    流经索非亚平原的伊斯克尔河的河水，将灌溉十四万四千英亩的土地。从前这些地方由于得不到水分而常年干旱，不长庄稼。共长六千五百公尺的运河，像一个长大的环带一样，围绕着索非亚平原，一直伸展到它的最偏远的角落里。运河的许多抽水站，将把河水输送到缺水的田地里去。
    在环形运河的中间，索非亚将更加美丽起来。它的自然环境将大大改变，整个城市将要成为花圃和绿荫的海洋。
    斯大林水闸和其他的建设工程已经在紧张地进行了。运货卡车满载着建筑器材，沿着普兰纳山的斜坡和伊斯克尔河岸的石堤忙碌地奔驰着，蒸气压榨机和碾石机在轰鸣着，火药的爆炸声震耳欲聋，劳动的声音和金属铁石的声音早已划破了山谷的宁静，一桩人和自然的伟大搏斗正在激烈地进行。
    在普兰纳山上，正在开凿着隧道。第一条隧道已经凿通了二公里，并铺设了钢骨水泥。坚强的人们攻入了岩石的内部，把无数的碎石从里边一列车一列车地装运出来，并把和着水的混凝土、支柱和大量木料送往隧道内。那些最勇敢的青年突击队员们所工作的地方，被称为朝鲜前线。这种象征的说法是毫不夸张的。在伸手不见五指的漆黑山洞里，空气是恶浊而且窒人的，人们一不留心，就会遭到岩石的袭击而受伤，岩壁上的水滴下来湿透了衣服，没有坚强的意志和为祖国建设而努力的决心的人们，在这里是一刻钟也难以停留的。但是青年们并没有停止他们的工作，他们继续着艰巨的劳动，决心要凿穿山岩的腹部，建造成通水的隧道。不久以前，斯大林水闸的建造者们怀着感激的心情举行了一次大会欢迎来自苏联的机器。的确，如果没有苏联供给的那些强大有力的各种机器，要进行这样巨大的建设工程是不可想像的。现在，工地上的工作，百分之九十都已经机械化了，即使连挖掘与运输工作也是如此。正是由于大规模地采用了苏联的机器，才在短期之内开凿了和移走了六万五千立方公尺的岩石，并在不久之前开始了水闸的混凝土浇灌工作。
    在水闸工地上工作的每一个人，都深切地感到斯大林同志生前对保加利亚人民建设新生活的关怀，他们都决心把这个以伟大导师的名字为名的水闸，建造得又迅速又牢固。开山工人、起重机和吊车的驾驶员们、挖掘手、混凝土工人和青年突击队员们，都在学习着以斯大林同志克服困难的大无畏精神来战胜自己工作中的困难。在他们的努力之下，斯大林水闸即将在一九五五年建造完成，三个水电站就要开始发电，到那时候，和斯大林的不朽名字联结在一起的自由幸福的光芒，就要照耀着保加利亚广大的山野和乡村了。  维克（附图片）
