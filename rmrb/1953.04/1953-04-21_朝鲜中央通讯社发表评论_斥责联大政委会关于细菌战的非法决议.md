    Korean Central News Agency Publishes Commentary
    Denouncing UN Political Committee's Illegal Resolution on Germ Warfare
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th] The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 19th, entitled "Korean People Resolutely Denounce the UN Political Committee's Illegal Resolution on Germ Warfare." The commentary stated: The so-called "impartial investigation" resolution on the use of bacteriological weapons by American troops, passed by the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee under the manipulation of the United States, is illegal and unreasonable. The Korean people are well aware of the sinister nature of this illegal resolution and firmly believe that it is nothing more than a piece of waste paper with no effect.

    The commentary pointed out: The Soviet representative has repeatedly suggested that representatives from Korea and China must be invited to participate in the discussion of this issue. Only in this way can the United Nations know the truth about the U.S. military's germ warfare. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese people are the parties who have suffered from the U.S. imperialists' germ warfare crimes. When discussing issues related to themselves, Korea and China have the right to attend as victims and plaintiffs, testify, and state their opinions. However, the United States, as the defendant, manipulated the United Nations to refuse to invite representatives from Korea and China to participate.

    The commentary then pointed out: The people of Korea and China have long possessed irrefutable physical and testimonial evidence of the U.S. military's germ warfare. Moreover, many famous international scientists, jurists, and social figures, after numerous investigations, have clearly confirmed the U.S. military's crimes of conducting germ warfare in Korea. In particular, the confessions of U.S. Air Force personnel who personally engaged in germ warfare after being captured have further conclusively confirmed this crime of the U.S. military. However, the United States, disregarding all of this, manipulated the United Nations to pass an illegal resolution to organize a so-called "Five-Nation Committee" to conduct a so-called "impartial investigation." The United States attempts to use "investigation" as a cover to deceive the people of the world.

    Now, while U.S. representatives, officials, and generals are vehemently denying the germ warfare crimes, U.S. military aircraft are still dropping germ-carrying insects such as spiders, flies, and beetles in Korea. Another purpose of the so-called "impartial investigation" by the United States is to attempt to use this to investigate the actual effects of germ warfare. The confessions of many U.S. spies recently captured in our front and rear areas have fully confirmed this despicable intention of the U.S. government.

    The commentary concluded by emphasizing that the Korean people believe that if the United Nations is willing to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter and fulfill its responsibilities, it must first condemn the U.S. germ warfare crimes, stop germ warfare, and at the same time urge the United States to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

### 朝鲜中央通讯社发表评论  斥责联大政委会关于细菌战的非法决议

    朝鲜中央通讯社发表评论
    斥责联大政委会关于细菌战的非法决议
    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜中央通讯社十九日发表评论，题为“朝鲜人民坚决斥责联大政委会关于细菌战的非法决议”。评论说：联合国大会政治委员会在美国操纵下通过的所谓“公正调查”关于美国军队使用细菌武器的决议，是非法的，是不合理的。朝鲜人民深知这个非法决议的凶恶本质，坚决认为它只不过是一张没有任何效力的废纸。
    评论指出：苏联代表曾一再建议，必须邀请朝鲜和中国的代表参加关于这个问题的讨论。只有这样，才可以使联合国能够知道美军进行细菌战的真相。同时，朝鲜人民和中国人民是遭受美帝国主义细菌战罪行的灾害的当事人。朝中两国在讨论与自己有关的问题时，具有以受害人和原告身份出席作证并陈述自己意见的权力。但是，作为被告的美国操纵联合国拒绝邀请朝中两国代表参加。
    评论接着指出：朝中两国人民很久以来就持有关于美军进行细菌战的无可辩驳的物证和人证。而且，许多著名的国际科学家、法学家和社会名流在经过多次调查之后，也都明确地证实了美军在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行。特别是由于亲身从事细菌战的美国空军人员在被俘之后的口供，进一步确凿地证实了美军这一罪行。但是，美国仍不顾这一切，操纵联合国通过了非法的决议，要组织什么“五国委员会”来进行所谓“公正调查”。美国企图以“调查”为幌子，来蒙蔽全世界人民。
    现在，与美国代表、官员和将军们矢口抵赖细菌战罪行的同时，美军飞机还在朝鲜投掷着蜘蛛、苍蝇和甲虫等带菌虫子。美国的所谓“公正调查”的另一个目的就是企图借此来调查细菌战的实际效果。最近在我国前后方继续捕获的许多美方特务的供词，已完全证实了美国政府的这一卑鄙意图。
    评论最后强调说：朝鲜人民认为：如果联合国愿意遵守联合国宪章原则履行自己职责的话，就必须首先谴责美国的细菌战罪行，制止细菌战，同时要促使美国批准禁止使用细菌武器和其他大规模杀人武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。
