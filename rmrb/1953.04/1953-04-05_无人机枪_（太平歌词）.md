    "Unmanned Machine Gun" (Taiping Lyrics)
    Zhou Tong, Volunteer Army Unit

    (Spoken) Today we're holding an entertainment evening on the position, and I'll sing a piece of Taiping Lyrics for everyone. This piece talks about how the American devils, under the heavy blows of the heroic Chinese and Korean People's Army, are low in morale, afraid of death, and war-weary, so they "created" the "unmanned machine gun." If you comrades want to know the details, listen to my song. (Singing) It's about Korea in July last year, when it rained every day without end, the shell craters were full of mud, and the water droplets on the grass leaves were bright and round. The soldiers were talking and laughing in the shelters, the sound of water and laughter blending together. The sentry stood guard in a concealed spot, vigilantly monitoring the front of the position. On the night of the 24th, two dark shadows ran towards the mountain opposite, one was Zhao Yongqiang, the platoon leader of the seventh company, and the other was Liu Yinian, an eighteen-year-old soldier. The two brave men accepted the reconnaissance mission, were resourceful, calm, and brave, and quickly reached the enemy's position at midnight. The two brave men approached the barbed wire fence, several places of which had been broken by our artillery fire. They crawled through the gaps, their bodies covered in cement. Suddenly they heard a noise in front, which they could faintly see. The short one looked like a gasoline barrel, and the tall one looked like half a telegraph pole. Platoon Leader Zhao saw the whole situation, he approached Xiao Liu and whispered: "While these two devils are changing guard, let's cross the sentry post and climb the small mountain." The two brave men crossed the enemy's sentry line. They climbed the mountain with light footsteps and suddenly found a heavy machine gun beside them, with a long string of bullets connected to the left side of the gun; this machine gun was aimed at our position, so why couldn't we see a single shooter? Platoon Leader Zhao and Xiao Liu looked carefully and found that it was a rope tied to the trigger. This "unmanned machine gun" is really strange, could it be a new discovery in military science?

    (Spoken) Comrades, is this "unmanned machine gun" really invented by military scientists? No, this is a new "creation" by American soldiers on the Korean battlefield. They tie the machine gun trigger with a rope, load the bullets into the chamber, connect a long string to the left, and there is a box of bullets below. The two brave men looked around, and there wasn't a single person in sight. Platoon Leader Zhao understood in his heart, this matter is really a bit funny. So he said to Xiao Liu: "Follow me!"
  (Singing) The two of them crawled forward along the rope, for about ten meters, when a corpse blocked their way.
  (Spoken) Humph, that's not right!
  (Singing) How can a dead man snore? He was snoring loudly, sleeping sweetly under the rain cloth. The two brave men looked along the rope, and the rope was tied to the devil's right ankle. This must be the shooter of the "unmanned machine gun", he is afraid of death so he is hiding on this side; when he discovers something, he pulls his right foot, pretending to do his job to boost his courage; when there is nothing, he sleeps, and changes shifts here. The two brave men quietly woke him up,
  (Whispering) "Hello!" "Hello!"
  (Singing) The "unmanned machine gun" shooter rubbed his eyes, he felt very strange in his heart, has the attitude of the superiors changed today? In the past, when they saw soldiers sleeping, they would kick them twice or punch them twice, if those squad leaders saw it, they would at least blow their mustaches and stare... The devil soldier opened his dead sheep eyes in a daze.
  (Spoken) "Ah yo!"
  (Singing) Two gun muzzles were already pointed at his chest, if he wanted to shout he would inevitably fire the gun, if he wanted to run his legs would tremble, helplessly he had to raise his hand and turn around, if he was told to go north he wouldn't dare to go south. The two brave men brought the prisoner and the spoils down the mountain, the east was about to dawn.

    “无人机枪”（太平歌词）
    志愿军某部  周桐
    （白）今天咱们在阵地上开娱乐晚会，我来给大家唱一段太平歌词。这段歌词说的是美国鬼子在英勇的中朝人民军队的沉重打击下，士气低落，怕死厌战，于是就“创造”了“无人机枪”。各位同志要知详细，且听我唱来。（唱）说的是朝鲜去年七月间，天天雨水落不完，炮弹坑里泥水满，草叶上的水珠儿亮又圆。战士们在掩蔽部里说说笑笑，水声、笑声连成一片。监视哨持枪在隐蔽地处站，机警地监视着阵地前沿。二十四日那天夜晚，有两个黑影奔向对面的山，一个是七连的排长赵永强，一个是十八岁的战士刘义年。二勇士接受了侦察任务，机智、沉着又勇敢，迅速到达了敌人阵地，正是半夜十二点。二勇士接近了铁丝网，铁丝网几处已被我炮火打断，顺着缺口爬过去，身上的水泥已沾满。忽听前面有声响，隐隐约约地能看见，那矮个好像汽油桶，高个好像半截电线杆。赵排长把这情况看的全，他靠近了小刘低声言：“趁这两个鬼子正换岗，咱越过岗哨爬上小山。”二勇士越过了敌哨监视线。脚步轻快爬上了山，忽然发现那旁有一挺重机枪，枪左边连着子弹带一大串；这机枪的射击方向是我阵地，为什么一个射手也看不见？赵排长和小刘仔细看，原来是一条绳子把扳机拴。这“无人机枪”真奇怪，难道是军事科学上的新发现？
    （白）各位同志们，这“无人机枪”真是军事科学家发明的吗？不是的，这是美国士兵们在朝鲜战场上的新“创造”。他们把机枪扳机用绳子拴着，把子弹引进枪膛里，左边连着一大串，下边还有一箱子弹。二勇士看了看，连个人影子也没有。赵排长心里明白了，这件事真有点好笑。于是他就对小刘说了声：“跟我来！”
  （唱）他两人顺着绳子往前爬，约摸爬了十几公尺远，有一个尸体挡住了去路，
  （白）哼，不对！
  （唱）死人哪能把气喘？呼噜呼噜他直打鼾，蒙着雨布睡的甜。二勇士顺着绳子看，绳子就在这鬼子的右脚脖上拴。这一定就是“无人机枪”的射手，他怕死才躲在这一边；发现情况他就右脚一拉，应付差事壮壮胆；没有情况就睡觉，换班就在这里换。二勇士悄悄地把他叫醒，
  （低声）“哈囉！”“哈囉！”
  （唱）“无人机枪”射手这才揉揉眼，他心里感觉很奇怪，今天长官的态度有转变？过去看见士兵在睡觉，不是踢两脚就打两拳，若是那几个班长碰到了，起码也要吹吹胡子瞪瞪眼……鬼子兵迷迷糊糊地睁开了死羊眼，
  （白）“啊哟！”
  （唱）两个枪口已对到胸前，要想叫喊必然开枪，要想逃跑两腿打战，无奈何他只好举手向后转，叫他向北他不敢向南。二勇士带着俘虏和胜利品下了山，东方已经要明天。
