Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd. According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker": The United Automobile Workers (UAW), the largest labor union in the United States (affiliated with the CIO), passed a resolution at its convention last week calling on Eisenhower to accept the proposal of Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Malenkov for peaceful negotiations to resolve issues. This is the first time that this union, with 1.35 million members but controlled by conservative union leaders, has taken such a stance.

The resolution stated: "On the critical issue of Korea, shameful and unattainable campaign promises have been broken. President Eisenhower has been to Korea. Our soldiers have not yet come home."

The resolution reiterated the UAW's previous support for Truman's policy of aggression in Korea, but went on to say: "We do not approve" of the "reckless military adventurers" who advocate launching an offensive in Korea and expanding the war to mainland China, "We do not approve of dragging Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt and discredited leadership group into this conflict... nor do we approve of American troops being mired in the vast Chinese mainland for a long time to support Chiang Kai-shek."

George Morris, a columnist for the "Daily Worker," commented on this new development among auto workers on March 25th, saying: "This resolution undoubtedly reflects (although it contains confusing wording) the developing trend of workers demanding peace." Morris pointed out that the organ of the Railway Labor Executives' Association, the "Labor" weekly, which has one million members, has also recently reflected this trend of demanding peace among union members.

The "Daily Worker" pointed out in an editorial on March 25th that the organ of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America (AFL) also called in a recent editorial for Washington to accept the proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Korea and to leave the prisoner of war issue to be resolved later. The editorial said that all of the above actions indicate a growing trend in the American labor movement to oppose the Eisenhower government's foreign policy of serving big capitalists, to oppose the Eisenhower government's refusal to cease fire in Korea, and to refuse to negotiate a post-war Soviet-American peace treaty.

The editorial said: "What is good for labor and America is a ceasefire and an end to the policy of big capitalists who are stopping negotiations at any cost."

### 美国工人要求和平的愿望日益高涨

    美国工人要求和平的愿望日益高涨
    【新华社布拉格二日电】据纽约“工人日报”报道：美国最大的工会联合汽车工人工会（属产联）上星期在代表大会上通过决议，要求艾森豪威尔接受苏联部长会议主席马林科夫关于和平谈判解决问题的建议。这是这个拥有一百三十五万会员但掌握在保守的工会头目手中的工会第一次采取这样的立场。
    决议说：“在紧要的朝鲜问题上，可耻的与无法实现的竞选诺言告吹了。艾森豪威尔总统已经去过朝鲜。我们的士兵还没有回家。”
    决议重申联合汽车工人工会以前支持杜鲁门对朝鲜的侵略政策的立场，但是接着说：“我们并不赞成”那些主张在朝鲜发动攻势并把战争扩大到中国大陆去的“鲁莽的军事冒险家”，“我们不赞成把蒋介石的腐朽的与信用扫地的领导集团拉进这场冲突中去……我们也不赞成为了支持蒋介石而使美国军队在辽阔的中国大陆长期陷入泥淖中。”
    “工人日报”专栏作家乔治·摩里斯三月二十五日发表评论，评汽车工人中这个新的发展说：“这个决议无疑地反映了（虽然里面包含有混乱的词句）正在发展中的工人要求和平的趋势。”摩里斯指出：拥有一百万会员的铁路工人工会的机关刊“劳工”周刊最近也曾反映了工会群众中间这种要求和平的趋势。
    “工人日报”在三月二十五日社论中指出，劳联的屠宰工人工会的机关刊物也在最近一期的社论中要求华盛顿接受立即在朝鲜停战、战俘问题留待以后解决的建议。社论说，所有以上的行动，表明了美国工人运动中有日益高涨的趋势，反对艾森豪威尔政府所执行的大资本家的外交政策、反对艾森豪威尔政府拒绝在朝鲜停火和拒绝谈判战后苏美和平条约。
    社论说：“对劳工与美国有好处的就是停火，并结束大资本家的不惜以任何代价阻止谈判的政策。”
