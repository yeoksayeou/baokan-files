    Academician A. Winter of the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently published an article in the Red Navy newspaper entitled "Electrification in the Soviet Union in the Fifth Five-Year Plan," which stated that the Soviet Union's electricity production is constantly increasing. Last year's electricity generation was over 100 billion kilowatt-hours, almost 2.5 times the electricity generation in 1940. Now, the Soviet Union's daily electricity generation is equal to the entire electricity generation in 1921.

    Winter wrote: The idea of electrification runs through every five-year plan, and electrification is one of the decisive factors in our country's communist construction plan. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, electricity production will increase by 80 percent. To ensure such a large increase in electricity production, the total power generation capacity of all power stations will increase by about two times, and the power generation capacity of hydropower stations will increase by three times. By the end of 1955, nearly half of all Soviet power stations will have been put into operation during these five years. Therefore, in terms of the particularly large number of new equipment, the Soviet Union's power industry will then surpass the power industries of all capitalist countries.

    Winter pointed out: The large-scale electrification of the Soviet Union is closely related to the work of transforming nature. The achievements of socialist industry and our country's entire economy have made it possible to turn to decisive steps in implementing the great plan to transform nature—building giant hydropower stations and digging canals. Never in the history of world engineering have there been such large-scale construction projects that can be built so quickly. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the world's largest power plant, the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, will begin generating electricity. It will generate 11 billion kilowatt-hours annually, equivalent to six times the electricity generation of all power stations in pre-revolutionary Russia. The Kama Hydroelectric Station, which fundamentally improves the power supply situation in the Urals, the Gorky Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River, the Mingachevir Hydroelectric Station in Transcaucasia, and the Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydroelectric Station on the Irtysh River will also begin generating electricity.

    Winter said: The instructions of the 19th Party Congress on the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan for development emphasize that the primary task of the machine-building industry is to fully supply power stations with equipment. During this five-year plan, the production of steam turbines will increase by 2.3 times, steam boilers by 2.7 times, and hydraulic turbines by 7.8 times. In the next three or four years alone, 37 hydraulic turbines will be manufactured for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. The highest power generation capacity of these turbines reaches 126,000 kilowatts, one and a half times the power generation capacity of the turbines installed at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station in the post-war era. These are the largest and most efficient hydraulic turbines in the world. Six hundred to seven hundred cubic meters of water flow into one turbine per second under high pressure. The power industry now also uses ultra-high pressure and ultra-high temperature steam. The Leningrad Stalin Metal Plant designed and manufactured the world's largest single-shaft turbine using ultra-high pressure steam, with a power generation capacity of 150,000 kilowatts. A giant boiler that generates 240 tons of steam per hour has been manufactured for this turbine. Power stations equipped with this type of machine save 80 percent more fuel than ordinary high-pressure power stations.

    Winter pointed out: The further development of electrification in the Soviet Union ensures that the production of various sectors of the national economy can be greatly increased. The increase in power production and the further use of electricity in industry will enable the widespread development of high-efficiency technological processes that ensure the mass production of goods at low cost. Farming methods will also be electrified. During the new five-year plan, the length of electrified railways will increase by four times. The electrification of huge construction projects is also of particular importance. Due to the start-up of new power generation equipment, the rate of increase in electricity production will be greater than stipulated in the five-year plan. Currently, the development of the foundation of electrification—the manufacture of steam turbines, hydraulic turbines, generators, giant electrical machines, electric motors, and electrical instruments—is proceeding more rapidly than planned.

    Academician Winter concluded: The basic economic law of socialism requires ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on a highly technical basis, and the electrification of the Soviet Union is a vivid example of this law in action.

    苏联在新五年计划期间电气化将迅速发展
      【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院院士亚·温特最近在红海军报上发表的一篇题为“苏联在第五个五年计划中的电气化”的文章说：苏联电力生产在不断增加。去年的发电量在一千亿瓩时以上，差不多是一九四零年发电量的二点五倍。现在，苏联国内一天的发电量就等于一九二一年全年的发电量。
    温特写道：电气化的思想贯穿在各个五年计划当中，电气化是我国共产主义建设计划的决定性因素之一。在第五个五年计划期间，电力生产将增加百分之八十。为了要保证电力生产能够这样地大大增长，全部电力站的发电总能力将增加到两倍左右，水电站的发电能力将增加到三倍。到一九五五年年底时，苏联全部动力站差不多有一半是在这五年中开工的。因此，从新设备特别多这一点来说，那时苏联的动力工业将更加超过一切资本主义国家的动力工业。
    温特指出：苏联的大规模电气化是和改造自然的工作密切地关联着的。社会主义工业和我国整个经济的成就，使得在执行伟大的改造自然计划中能够转向决定性的步骤——建设巨型水电站和开凿运河。世界工程史上从来没有过这样庞大的、能够这样迅速建设的建设工程。在第五个五年计划期间，世界上最大的电力厂古比雪夫水电站将开始发电。它每年将发电一百一十亿瓩时，相当于革命前俄国全部动力站发电量的六倍。根本改进乌拉尔动力供应情况的卡马水电站、伏尔加河上的高尔基水电站、外高加索的明基卡乌尔水电站、伊尔提斯河上的乌斯特卡曼诺戈尔斯克水电站等也都将开始发电。
    温特说：第十九次党代表大会关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示着重指出：机器制造业的头等重要的任务是充分供给动力站以设备。在这个五年计划期间，蒸汽透平的产量将增加到二点三倍，蒸汽锅炉增加到二点七倍，水力透平增加到七点八倍。在未来的三、四年中，单是为古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站制造的水力透平就有三十七个。这些透平中发电能力最高达到十二万六千瓩，为战后年代在第聂伯水电站安装的透平的发电能力一倍半。这些是世界上最大和最有效力的水力透平。每秒钟在高压下流进一个透平的水就有六百立方公尺到七百立方公尺。动力工业现在还利用超高压和超高温的蒸汽。列宁格勒斯大林五金工厂设计并制造了世界上最大的使用超高压蒸汽的单轴透平，它的发电能力是十五万瓩。已为这种透平制造了每小时发生二百四十吨蒸汽的巨型锅炉。配有这种机器的动力站比平常的高压电力站要节省百分之八十的燃料。
    温特指出：苏联电气化的进一步发展，保证国民经济各部门的生产可以大大地增加。动力的生产的增加和工业方面进一步使用电力，将使保证以低廉成本大批生产物品的高效率技术过程有广阔的发展。农作方法也将电气化。在新五年计划期间，电气化铁路的长度将增加到四倍。巨大建设工程的电气化同样具有特殊的重要意义。由于新的发电设备的开始发电，电力生产增加的速率将比五年计划规定的更大。现在，电气化基础的发展——蒸汽透平、水力透平、发电机、巨型电力机器、电动机和电气仪器的制造——比计划所规定的更为迅速。
    温特院士最后写道：社会主义基本经济法则要求用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，苏联的电气化便是这个法则发生作用的生动范例。
