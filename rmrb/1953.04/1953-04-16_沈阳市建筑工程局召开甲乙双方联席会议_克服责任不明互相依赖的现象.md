    Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau Holds Joint Meeting Between Parties A and B to Overcome the Phenomenon of Unclear Responsibilities and Mutual Dependence
    In order to change the phenomenon of unclear responsibilities and mutual dependence between Parties A and B in the construction preparation work, and to ensure on-time commencement of construction, the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau held a joint meeting of Parties A and B on March 26th. Representatives from the first, second, and third construction engineering companies under the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, as well as more than 20 units from Party A, attended the meeting.
    In the past, the responsibilities of the three construction engineering companies under the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau and the various contracting units were unclear, and Parties A and B did not understand each other's preparation work progress. For some projects, both parties had signed agreements and met once, and the projects were listed as first-phase construction during project sequencing. However, to date, the project indicators have not been determined, the project items are unclear, the address has been changed repeatedly, the design cannot be submitted on time, and the equipment and materials are insufficient. For temporary construction projects, Party A said that the box board materials should be prepared by Party B, and Party B said that they should be prepared by Party A, and as a result, no one prepared them. For the geological drilling and testing work before the start of construction, Party A said that it did not understand the technology, and Party B said that it was Party A's responsibility, and they shirked their responsibilities to each other. With the start date approaching, this phenomenon of unclear responsibilities and mutual dependence is seriously affecting the work of uniformly arranging the order of projects and the start date.
    In light of the above situation, the meeting first understood the preparation situation, clarified the project indicators, fixed the project items, and mutually agreed on plans to clarify the responsibilities of both parties. For past unresolved cases caused by unclear responsibilities, and where the regulations between Parties A and B were unclear, inappropriate, or incomplete, efforts were made to supplement and resolve them. After mutual inspection by both parties, the meeting divided the current construction engineering preparation work into the following three types: 1. Projects with good preparation, which can be strived for in the first phase of construction with further efforts, include the construction projects of the Academy of Sciences, the Agricultural College, and the China Medical University. Generally, 30% of the materials have been transported to the site, most of the design drawings have been delivered, and the construction budget has been started. The current problems are that the material specifications do not match, there is a lack of gravel, and large stones cannot be used for floor slabs; drilling and ground bearing capacity tests have not been carried out. 2. Projects with poor preparation, which must be strived for in the first phase of construction with great efforts, include the construction projects of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau. The indicators of these projects have changed repeatedly, the project items are unclear, and due to the unclear responsibilities of Parties A and B in the past, no one applied for the allocation of materials, the design cannot be submitted on time, and the address has not been determined. 3. Projects with no clue in the preparation work, unclear situation, and far from the conditions for commencement of construction include the Normal College, the Commercial Bureau, and the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, most of which have no design, no project, no investment, no geological data, and no materials.
    The meeting analyzed the above situation and determined several positive measures, and established a responsibility system for both parties. For the first type of project, in order to ensure the quality of the project and prevent substandard materials from being used in the project, Party A and B will organize an inspection team to comprehensively check the material situation and solve specific problems. Party A is responsible for the materials in Party A's warehouse, and Party B will cooperate with the inspection. For all materials that have entered the site, Party B will preside over the inspection, and Party A will cooperate with the inspection. For major materials, it was decided to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the quantity, specifications, variety, quality, and storage methods of the materials according to the design drawings, so as to have a clear understanding and avoid blindly starting construction. For the ground bearing capacity exploration test of general buildings, it was decided to adopt a simple method, presided over by Party A and assisted by Party B, and submitted to the competent department for approval. If some drawings need to be modified, Party B is responsible for obtaining Party A's consent. For the second type of project, Party A should promptly determine the indicators, confirm the project items, and find a suitable address. Party A and B should also formulate commencement conditions as a goal to strive for. For the third type of project, opinions should be actively submitted to its leading organs to urge them to do a good job in preparation and strive to start construction on time.
    The meeting also introduced the experience of the Northeast Geological Bureau, which had a short preparation time but did a good job in preparation. The cadres attending the meeting believed through this discussion that it is necessary to strengthen the overall concept, and Parties A and B should work together to do a good job in preparation to ensure on-time commencement of construction.

    沈阳市建筑工程局召开甲乙双方联席会议
    克服责任不明互相依赖的现象
    沈阳市建筑工程局为改变施工准备工作中甲乙双方责任不明，互相依赖的现象，以保证按期开工，于三月二十六日召开了甲乙双方联席会议。到会有沈阳市建筑工程局所属第一、第二、第三三个建筑工程公司及甲方二十多个单位。
    过去一段时期，沈阳市建筑工程局所属三个建筑工程公司与各发包单位责任不明，甲乙双方互不了解对方准备工作的进度。有的工程，双方已签订了协议书，碰了一次头，工程排队时已列为第一期施工的工程。但至今工程指标未定，工程项目不明，地址屡次改变，设计不能按时提出，器材也不敷需要。有的暂设工程所用盒子板材料，甲方说由乙方准备，乙方说由甲方准备，结果是没有人准备。开工前的地质钻探、试验等工作，甲方说自己不懂技术，乙方说是甲方的事，互相推诿。现在开工日期已近，这种责任不明，互相依赖的现象，严重地影响了统一排列工程顺序和开工日期的工作。
    根据上述情况，这次会议首先互相了解了准备情况，弄清工程指标，固定工程项目，互订计划，明确双方责任。对于过去由于责任不明造成的悬案，和甲乙双方过去虽已明确规定，但规定得不妥和不周的地方，都设法补充和解决了。经双方互相检查后，会议将目前建筑工程的准备工作分成了下列三种类型：一、准备较好，再加努力可以在第一期施工的有科学院、农学院、中国医大等单位的建筑工程。这些工程一般地已有百分之三十的材料运进现场，设计图纸大部分送到，已着手做施工预算。目前存在的问题是材料规格不符，缺乏碎石，大块石不能打楼板；没有进行钻探和地耐力试验。二、准备较差，必须以极大努力才能争取在第一期施工的有东北电业局等单位的建筑工程。这些工程的指标屡变，项目不明，由于过去甲乙双方责任不明，物资调拨无人申请，设计不能按时提出，地址尚未确定。三、准备工作毫无头绪，情况不明，距离开工条件很远的有师范专科学校、商业局、沈阳市总工会等单位的建筑工程，其中大部是无设计、无项目、无投资、无地质资料、无材料。
    会议分析了上述情况，确定了几项积极措施，订立了双方的责任制度。对第一类情况的工程，为保证工程质量，不把不合标准的材料用到工程上去，由甲乙双方组织检查组全面检查材料情况，具体解决。甲方仓库材料由甲方负责，乙方配合检查。已进入现场的各项材料，由乙方主持，甲方配合检查，对主要材料，决定根据设计图纸，对材料的数量、规格、品种、质量和储藏方法，全面地深入地检查一次，作到心中有数，避免盲目动工。一般建筑物的地耐力探测试验，决定采取简单的办法进行，由甲方主持，乙方协助，并呈请主管部门批准。有的图纸如需修改，由乙方负责，取得甲方同意。对第二类情况的工程，甲方要从速确定指标，肯定项目，找好地址，甲乙双方并应订出开工条件作为奋斗目标。对第三类情况的工程，要向其领导机关积极提出意见，督促他们做好准备工作，争取按时开工。
    会议上并介绍了东北地质局筹备时间短，但准备工作做得好的经验。到会的干部通过这次讨论，都认为必须加强整体观念，甲乙双方要共同努力做好准备工作，保证按时开工。
