The women and children's welfare work in New China has greatly developed along with the development of China's economic construction.

Health departments and the Democratic Women's Federation in various parts of the country vigorously promote new midwifery methods and maternal and child health work. Nearly 30,000 maternal and child health stations, obstetrics and gynecology hospitals, children's hospitals, and midwifery stations have been established in urban and rural areas. More than 269,000 midwives have been trained and reformed. Various localities also frequently use models, wall charts, slides, and other methods to widely publicize maternal and child health knowledge to the urban and rural working people. The broad masses of working women across the country have gradually been liberated from feudal and backward old midwifery methods and unsanitary environments. The pain of childbirth for mothers has been reduced, the health of mothers and children has been enhanced, and the mortality rate of mothers and infants has been greatly reduced. For example, in Beijing, before the widespread adoption of new midwifery methods, the maternal mortality rate was 7 per thousand. After the widespread adoption of new midwifery methods, the maternal mortality rate dropped to 0.7 per thousand. In Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, when old midwifery methods were used in the past, the infant mortality rate was as high as 50% or more. After the widespread adoption of new midwifery methods, the infant mortality rate dropped to 4.8%. According to incomplete statistics, in 1952, thirteen major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and twenty-two provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, and Jiangsu, piloted the Soviet Union's advanced experience—painless childbirth. Among the more than 48,000 people participating in the experiment, nearly 90% of the women did not experience pain during childbirth. The gradual promotion of this advanced experience will enable millions of mothers across the country to be free from the pain of childbirth.

The national childcare work has also greatly developed. More than 21,000 childcare workers have been trained across the country. In 1952, there were 2,738 nurseries in factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools, an increase of 22 times compared with 1949. In large and medium-sized cities, 4,346 street nurseries have also been established to accommodate the children of working women. In rural areas, various forms of busy-season childcare organizations are developing. In 1952, there were a total of 148,200 busy-season childcare groups and busy-season nurseries across the country, accommodating more than 850,000 children, a ten-fold increase compared with 1951. Wherever there are nurseries or childcare stations, female workers and female staff members of institutions can work actively and strive to produce. In 1952, when the Xinhua Yarn Factory in Tangshan City promoted the 1951 weaving work method, the good management of the nursery inspired the labor enthusiasm of the mothers, and the female worker groups with children set two new records of no defective cloth in a row. In the patriotic production increase labor competition, sixty mothers became red banner bearers. After the establishment of busy-season childcare organizations in rural areas, many women who were previously burdened by their children were able to invest their labor in agricultural production. For example, in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, last year, during the summer hoeing season, busy-season childcare stations were organized, freeing up 10,986 mothers to participate in equal-distance, wide-sowing, thinning, seedling protection, and phased topdressing agricultural production, which played a certain role in the county's overall bumper harvest. The establishment of busy-season childcare organizations has also enabled many rural women to take time out from production to participate in social activities, reading groups, and literacy classes.

The People's Government regularly cares about the health of children. Local health departments have listed the prevention and treatment of acute infectious diseases in children as a regular task. Every year on "June 1st" Children's Day, major cities across the country hold large-scale children's health check-up campaigns. In the "June 1st" festivals of 1951 and 1952, a total of 816,300 children participated in health check-ups. Through this check-up, parents understand the health of their children, understand scientific childcare knowledge, and improve childcare methods. Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Qingdao have set up playgrounds for children in parks, and cultural centers and reading rooms are located in convenient transportation areas. Many trains have mother-child carriages, making travel particularly comfortable for mothers and children. Under the kind care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the lives of mothers and children in New China will become even better.

### 我国妇女儿童福利事业有很大发展

    我国妇女儿童福利事业有很大发展
    新中国的妇女儿童福利事业，随着我国经济建设的开展有很大的发展。
    全国各地的卫生部门、民主妇联大力推广新法接生和妇婴卫生工作，在广大城镇和农村已经设立了妇幼保健站、妇产科医院、儿童医院以及接生站将近三万处，训练和改造了接生员二十六万九千余名。各地还经常采用模型、挂图、幻灯等方式向城乡劳动人民广泛宣传妇幼卫生知识。全国广大的劳动妇女已逐渐地从封建落后的旧法接生和不卫生的环境中解放出来，母亲生育的痛苦减轻了，母子的健康增强了，产妇和婴儿的死亡率大大降低。如北京市在没有普遍采用新法接生以前，产妇的死亡率是千分之七，普遍采用新法接生以后，产妇的死亡率降低为千分之零点七。山西省长治专区在过去采用旧法接生时，婴儿死亡率高达百分之五十以上，普遍采用新法接生后，婴儿死亡率降低为百分之四点八。据不完全统计，一九五二年内全国已有北京、天津、上海等十三个大城市和河北、山西、江苏等二十二个省里试行了苏联的先进经验——无痛分娩法，在参加试验的四万八千多人中，有将近百分之九十的产妇分娩时没有痛苦。这一先进经验的逐渐推广，将使全国千百万个母亲们都能免除生育的痛苦。
    全国的儿童保育工作也有很大的发展。全国已培养了保育工作者二万一千余人。一九五二年工矿、企业、机关、学校中的托儿所已达二千七百三十八处，比一九四九年增加了二十二倍。在大、中城市中还建立了街道托儿站四千三百四十六处，收容劳动妇女的子女。在农村中，各种形式的农忙托儿组织正在发展，一九五二年全国共有农忙托儿组和农忙托儿所十四万八千二百余处，收容儿童八十五万余人，比一九五一年增加十倍。凡是有了托儿所或是托儿站的地方，女工们和机关女工作人员们都能积极工作，努力生产。一九五二年唐山市新华纱厂，在推广一九五一织布工作法时，由于托儿所办得好，鼓舞了母亲们的劳动热情，因而有孩子的女工组连创两次不出次布的新纪录，在爱国增产劳动竞赛中，有六十个妈妈当了红旗手。农村中农忙托儿组织成立后，使得许多原来被孩子拖累的妇女劳动力投入到农业生产中去。如黑龙江肇源县在去年夏锄中组织了农忙托儿站，替出一万零九百八十六名母亲参加等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥等农业生产，对于该县的全面丰产起了一定作用。农忙托儿组织的成立又使得不少农村妇女能在生产之余抽出时间来参加社会活动、参加读报组和识字班。
    人民政府经常关心儿童的健康情况。各地卫生部门把预防和治疗儿童的急性传染病列为经常工作之一。每年“六一”儿童节，全国各大城市都举行大规模的儿童健康检查运动，一九五一年和一九五二年的“六一”节，共有八十一万六千三百个儿童参加健康检查。通过这一检查，使得父母们了解儿童的健康情况，懂得科学的育儿知识，改进育儿的方法。北京、上海、青岛等城市在公园中都为儿童设立游戏场，在交通方便的地方设有文化馆、阅览室；在铁路列车上很多都设有母子列车，让母亲和孩子们旅行时特别舒适。在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的亲切关怀下，新中国的母亲和儿童的生活将更加美好起来。    （新华社）
