Beijing's spring. The first spring of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan.

The Five-Year Plan excites the hearts of the people of Beijing. Workers at the steel plant used record time to repair the No. 2 blast furnace ahead of schedule, as a gift to the motherland's large-scale construction. In universities, colleges, and specialized schools, professors are adopting Soviet textbooks, teaching plans, and outlines, preparing to send batches of construction cadres to the country. Students who just entered university last year are calculating that they can still catch the last year of the Five-Year Plan after graduation. Inside the office building of the State Planning Commission, calculators are busily turning. Hundreds of cadres are working day and night, tensely calculating and drawing the blueprint for the Five-Year Plan. Inside the factories, workers are discussing the 1953 production plan, seeing the long-term prospects of national construction from the production figures of their groups.

In the suburbs, busy spring plowing has already begun. The tractors driven out of the newly established state-owned machine stations are running along the fields. The loosened soil emits the fresh breath of spring, happily rolling down layer by layer from the plows. Here and there, mutual aid teams are challenging each other in competitions. The sounds of yelling at livestock and singing and laughter ring out together. Women and old men have all gone to the fields, leaving only the old women with children, busy delivering food to the fields.

With the arrival of the first spring of the first Five-Year Plan, the capital construction of Beijing is being intensified. Newly erected building frames, far and near, stand in the four suburbs, like giants standing on the earth, drawing on people's infinite energy, changing its appearance day by day. In the past three years, Beijing has built more than 253,000 rooms, and this year's plan is to build more than 180,000 rooms. Spring construction has already begun, and construction workers are busy on the scaffolds. Labor is boiling here. The loudspeakers on the construction sites constantly emit urgent sounds, directing: "Send materials to Section ××," "Section ×× prepare." Mule carts and trucks, one after another, pull bricks, tiles, stones, wood, and steel bars to the construction sites. Red and gray new buildings have already sprung up in the fields, like birds spreading their wings, proudly overlooking the earth. This is the factory area, where the future textile factory will start operating, and tens of thousands of spindles will spin quickly. Over there is a machine manufacturing factory, where exquisite machine tool mother machines will be transported out, driving more pulleys to turn. Cement plants and paper mills, leather factories and chemical plants, the future towering factory chimneys will replace today's countless building scaffolds. This is the cultural and educational district. Along the tree-lined avenues, along the Central Institute for Nationalities, Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and the Marxist-Leninist Institute, a cultural and educational city centered on the Academy of Sciences will be formed. More universities and colleges will be established here, including the Aviation Institute, the Iron and Steel Institute, the Geological Institute, the Mining Institute, and the Medical College... The future cultural and educational city will be one-third larger than the existing city of Beijing. Now, tall poplars stand tall on both sides of the avenue, watching the growth of these buildings. The buildings of the various institutes, commissions, ministries, and associations of the Central People's Government have already appeared one by one on both sides of this central avenue. This will be the central hub of the country's political and economic life, connecting the breath of hundreds of millions of people of the motherland. Here, Beijing—the heart of the motherland—will hear the pace of the motherland's progress. Every production achievement, every new accomplishment, is reported here, and new instructions are received from here and transmitted down. Here, the motherland is directed to advance!

Construction is proceeding with all its strength. Construction workers come from all over the country, from the old liberated areas of Shanxi and Hebei, and also from the coastal cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou. They all feel that participating in the construction of the capital is the most glorious. They all say: "We want to build Beijing as beautiful as Moscow." Their confidence is fully justified. Not only because the red star of Beijing emits the same light as Moscow, but also because Beijing, like Moscow, is one of the few ancient famous cities in the world.

But the people of Beijing have not forgotten that while building our happy life, the evil wolf is lurking and roaring outside the door. Therefore, they cherish even more the volunteers advancing in the muddy rain in Korea, the people's navy patrolling day and night in the raging waves, the iron eagles of Mao Zedong guarding the motherland in the vast sky, and the border guards in the deep mountains and dense forests of the southwest border. This spring, Beijing has sent more than 101,000 letters to the front. Learning from the volunteers has formed a mass movement in factories, schools, and street residents. The Liu Guangjin team of the Shijingshan Power Plant, inspired by the deeds of the volunteers, successfully test-fired inferior coal, reducing fuel costs by 41%. The North China Agricultural Machinery Factory overfulfilled the state production plan after launching the movement to learn from the volunteers. The students of the Qiu Shaoyun team of Tsinghua University often use the spirit of Qiu Shaoyun to examine their own study, work, and life, and their entire team has maintained excellent academic performance.

Early in the morning, when the city wakes up from dawn, her hardworking residents tidy up her appearance. The hygiene team members of more than 3,000 large and small hutongs sweep the streets clean with water. Whistles sound happily, workers start work, mutual aid team members start working in the fields, and elementary school students walk past the red walls of Tiananmen with their schoolbags on their backs. In the laboratory, gray-haired old professors and young assistants carefully analyze the properties of the soil. The radio broadcasts brisk music, and tens of thousands of people do radio exercises in the morning glow. The little babies in the nursery breathe fresh air in the face of the rising sun. On Tiananmen Square, kites are flying in the blue sky, and children clap their hands and cheer the arrival of spring. In Beihai, Shichahai, and Kunming Lake, painted boats sway in the blue waves, and young people sing loudly on the boats. Lilacs are in full bloom in the Summer Palace, and magnolias are also emitting a faint fragrance. Tourists drive out of the city in car after car. On warm spring evenings, the beautiful sun shines obliquely on the magnificent pailou of East and West Chang'an Street. Wangfujing Street surges with a spring tide-like flow of people, flocking to department stores, cooperatives, Xinhua bookstores, and Dong'an Market. In front of movie theaters and theaters, people buying tickets line up in long queues. "Dawn Shines on Moscow" has been "sold out" for two months. At night, when the lights of thousands of homes gradually disappear, the people of Beijing, after a day of labor, are resting, and they are preparing to devote themselves to tomorrow's creative labor.

The spring of Beijing, the spring of the motherland! We are full of confidence to build our capital, our motherland.

Notice: The "Resist America, Aid Korea" special issue will be edited by the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association from this issue onwards. At the same time, the scope of reports will be expanded to strengthen the connection between the front and the rear, the troops and the people, and to strengthen the patriotic and internationalist education of the troops and the people in resisting America and aiding Korea. We hope that readers will give constant attention and help, and continue to improve this publication.

    北京的春天
       金凤
    北京的春天。祖国第一个五年计划的第一个春天。
    五年计划激动着北京的人心。钢铁厂的工人，用创纪录的时间，提前修复第二号高炉，作为对祖国开始大规模建设的献礼。大学、学院和专科学校里，教授们在采用着苏联的教材、教学计划和提纲，准备着给国家送出一批批的建设干部。去年刚入大学的学生们，在计算着自己毕业后还可以赶上五年计划的最后一年。国家计划委员会的办公大楼内，计算器在忙碌地转动着。几百个干部日夜紧张地计算着、描绘着五年计划的蓝图。工厂内，工人们在讨论着一九五三年的生产计划，他们从小组生产数字看到国家建设的远景。
    郊外，紧张的春耕已经开始。新成立的国营机器站开出来的拖拉机，正沿着原野奔跑。翻松的泥土，发出新鲜的春天的气息，欢欢喜喜地从蚕轮上一层层翻滚下来。这里、那里，互助组在挑战竞赛。吆喝牲口的声音和歌声、笑声响成一片。妇女和老头都下地了，只剩下老太太带着孩子，忙着给地里送饭。
    随着第一个五年计划的第一个春天的降临，北京市的基本建设在加紧进行。新起的建筑架，远远近近，矗立在四郊，像是屹立在大地上的巨人，在汲取着人们无穷的精力，为它一天变一个模样。三年来北京已经修了二十五万三千多间房屋，今年的计划是修十八万多间。春季施工已经开始，建筑工人正在架子上忙碌着。劳动在这里沸腾着。工地上的播音机，时时传出急促的声音，在指挥着：“往××工段送料”，“××工段准备”。骡马大车、卡车一辆接一辆地拉着砖瓦、石块、木材、钢条往工地上送。红色的、灰色的新楼房已在原野中矗立起来，像鸟儿展开翅膀，骄傲地俯视着大地。这里是工厂区，未来的纺织厂将在这里开工，几万纱锭将飞快地转动起来。那边是机器制造厂，精致的母机机床将从这里运送出去，带动更多的轮带转动。水泥厂和造纸厂，皮革厂和化学厂，未来的林立的工厂烟囱，将代替今日无数的建筑架子。这里是文教区。沿着林荫大道，沿着中央民族学院、中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、马列学院将构成以科学院为中心的文教城。更多的大学和学院将在这里设立，其中有航空学院、钢铁学院、地质学院、矿业学院、医学院……未来的文教城将比现有的北京城大三分之一。现在，高大的白杨树挺立在大道两旁，注视着这些建筑的成长。中央人民政府各院、委、部、会的大厦，已经一座座地出现在这中央大道的两旁。这里将是全国政治、经济生活的中枢，沟通着祖国几万万人民的呼吸。在这里，北京——祖国的心脏，将听得见祖国前进的步伐。每一项生产成绩，每一种新的成就，都向这里汇报上来，又从这里得到新的指示传达下去。这里指挥着祖国前进！
    建设正以全力进行着。建筑工人来自全国各地，有从山西、河北老解放区来的，也有来自上海、广州沿海的城市。他们都感到参加首都建设是最光荣的。他们都说：“我们要把北京建筑得和莫斯科一样的美丽。”他们的信心是完全有根据的。不仅因为北京的红星发射着和莫斯科一样的光芒，也因为北京和莫斯科一样是世界上有数的历史悠久的名城。
    但是北京的人民并没有忘记在建设我们幸福生活的时候，那在门外窥伺着、咆哮着的恶狼。因此，他们加倍怀念着那在朝鲜急雨的泥泞中前进的志愿军，那在汹涌波涛中日夜巡逻着的人民海军，那在辽阔天空中守卫着祖国的毛泽东的铁鹰，那在西南边境深山密林中的边防战士。今年春季，北京市发往前方的信有十万一千多封。学习志愿军在工厂、学校、街道居民中形成群众性的运动。石景山发电厂的刘光金小组，在志愿军的事迹鼓舞下，试烧劣质煤成功，降低燃料成本百分之四十一。华北农业机械厂在开展学习志愿军运动后，超额完成国家生产计划。清华大学邱少云小组的学生，经常用邱少云的精神检查自己的学习、工作和生活，他们全组保持了优良的学习成绩。
    一清早，当城市从黎明中醒来，她的勤劳的居民就为她整顿容妆。三千多条大、小胡同的卫生组员，把街道用水泼扫干净。汽笛愉快地鸣叫起来，工人们开始上工，互助组组员开始下地，小学生背着书包走过天安门的红墙。实验室里，白发苍苍的老教授和年轻的助手们在仔细化验着土壤的性能。收音机播送着轻快的音乐，几万人在朝霞下做着广播体操。托儿所的小宝宝迎着初升的太阳呼吸新鲜空气。天安门广场上，风筝在蓝空中放起，孩子们拍手欢呼春天的到来。北海、什刹海和昆明湖中，画舫在碧波中荡漾，青年们在船上纵声高唱。颐和园的丁香盛开，玉兰也在散发幽香。郊游的人，一车一车往城外开去。温暖的春天傍晚，丽日斜照在东西长安街金碧辉煌的牌坊上。王府井大街汹涌着春潮一样的人流，往百货公司、合作社、新华书店、东安市场涌去。电影院和剧场门口，买票的人排着长长的行列。“曙光照耀着莫斯科”已经“客满”两个月了。入夜，当万家灯火逐渐消失的时候，北京的人民，劳动了一天，都在休息了，他们要准备投入明天的创造性的劳动中去。
    北京的春天，祖国的春天啊！我们满怀信心来建设我们的首都，我们的祖国。启    事抗美援朝专刊从本期起改由中国人民抗美援朝总会编辑，同时扩大报道范围，以加强前方和后方、部队和人民的联系，加强对部队和人民的抗美援朝的爱国主义和国际主义的教育。希望读者给予经常的关心和帮助，继续改进这个刊物。
