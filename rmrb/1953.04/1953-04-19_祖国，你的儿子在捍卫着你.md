　　In our Volunteer Army reconnaissance unit, every scout uses Matrosov, Huang Jiguang, and Qiu Shaoyun as standards for treating their own lives. Who should I write about?
　　One night, our squad leader, Li Guixi, went to blow up the enemy's bunker. As soon as he installed the explosives, the fuse was cut off by the enemy, and he himself was wounded in the chest and legs. What to do? Behind him, the soldiers were waiting for the explosives to explode, and they would immediately launch a battle; at that time, the artillery immediately fired to suppress the firepower, the engineers immediately cleared the mines and barbed wire, the assault team and the capture group immediately pounced on the enemy, so that a platoon of "Syngman Rhee" would be smashed to pieces, there would be a "live tongue" to reveal the situation, the meritorious service plan would be realized, and so on... Thinking of these, our squad leader endured the pain and crawled to light the fuse. Crawling, feeling, almost there, he clung to the last stone cliff, supporting himself with one hand, grabbing a bundle of dry thorns with the other, intending to use force to get up, but unfortunately, the thorns broke, and he rolled down the cliff, all the way to the barbed wire, and the enemy wounded his right hand for the second time. At this time, the east was already turning white, and it was about to lose the battle opportunity, he was anxious, angry, and in pain. Lighting it had already become too late, he thought of "pulling the trigger" (the explosive was loaded with both a burning and pulling fuze), but being so close would kill himself. However, the heroic image of Dong Cunrui sacrificing himself to blow up the bunker immediately appeared in his mind, so he did not hesitate to pull, pull, and use force. One hand couldn't pull it, so he crawled to the edge of the cliff and rolled down the cliff with the fuse. The explosives exploded, and the flying stones hit his head again, the strong vibration made him deaf and mute, and the blood froze into ice on his face, chest, hands, and legs. The battle was developing, and he refused his comrades to carry him, and crawled back to the position by himself. I went to see him, and he was lying on the bed smiling. I said, "Comrade, I will definitely apply for a commendation for you." Suddenly his face changed, and he took out his meritorious service plan and said to me:
　　"I guarantee to capture a live one in this battle and find out the situation. Even if I lose an arm or a leg, I will fight to the end."
　　But now the doctor wants to send our squad leader away. As soon as he saw the stretcher, he immediately became extraordinarily nervous, and kept calling me. I sat next to him, and he ignored the pain of his wound, crawled over, fell into my arms, and said to my face: "Commander, am I finished like this?..." I interrupted him: "Why do you say that? You will be fine soon." He looked bitter, his eyes fixed on me: "Commander, the wound is on my body, the plan is in my heart, the more I think about it, the more afraid I am, can I still make merit! Can I still see Chairman Mao! I often think like this: one day, I, or a few of us, will hold a tunnel, so that the enemy can attack for ten days and a half months without being able to capture it; I will also go behind enemy lines to collect information... but now I haven't done any of them. Am I worthy of the motherland? How will I answer when my mother asks me? The motherland is carrying out great construction, and everyone is contributing everything they have. What have I contributed?"
　　My throat felt like it was stuffed with something, dry and unable to make a sound. Because I also know how painful it is when a person's ideals are not fully realized!
　　I also thought of our surveyor, Comrade Ma Ren. He was a college student, and the days of fighting in Korea made him stronger. His diary reads: "Gadfly—Paul—Ma Ren".
　　A month ago, he went deep behind enemy lines to survey the enemy's artillery positions. While passing through the enemy's position, he got separated from a scout. The two of them insisted on carrying out their mission, living in the jungle and rocks for more than a month, relying on the supplies captured from the enemy. They finally drew the map, captured prisoners, and understood the situation, successfully completing the task. On the way back, the scout stepped on a landmine and was injured. Ma Ren carried him for four days. When he came back, Ma Ren was no longer human: his body was covered with scabies, purplish-black blood was stagnant on his toes, and his night blindness was also very serious. The superiors decided to send him to recuperate. At this time, if you don't know what kind of flame is burning in the hearts of the comrades, you may make this decision ineffective. Therefore, I said to Ma Ren: "Go to recuperate! Didn't Paul also admit that a person has no right to damage his own body? Even Matrosov loved his life the most." Only then did he go. Five days later, I suddenly received a letter from the nurse, which read: "Comrade Ma Ren has sacrificed! Comrade, blame me for being useless! Such a person, no force can stop him from ceasing to fight. As soon as he heard that the special agents had been airdropped here, I couldn't hold him, and he ran out. As soon as he reached the foot of the mountain, he ran into the special agents. He shot one dead, but the other wounded his hand and broke his gun. He pounced on them, wrestled with the special agents, fell to the ground, and rolled into the river. Comrade Ma Ren only had one hand, and blood was still flowing out, the special agents struggled desperately. In the end, he lured the special agents to the heart of the river and pressed them into the ice cave, but our Comrade Ma Ren never got up again..."
　　After reading this letter, I didn't know what to say for a long time.
　　At this time, a pile of landmine detonators was placed in front of me. These detonators were brought by He Jinhan, a Youth League member who was only eighteen years old. He had been upset for a few days because he had not been approved to be a scout. In order to clear the obstacles to the attack, the scouts went to remove the landmines. Taking the mines away would be noticed by the enemy, so the landmines had to remain in place, but the detonators had to be taken back for their own use. The little guy also took on this task, and he handed in more than twenty detonators by himself. Recently, he had to wade across the river twice a day and feel around in the snow, and his hands were swollen from the cold.
　　Today, as soon as he arrived in the minefield, the enemy's small units came down. The clever little guy immediately hid, held the mine cord in his hand, and pulled the mine when the enemy approached. Because the distance was too close, the shrapnel also wounded his arm. He bandaged it with a first-aid kit and didn't tell anyone, and went back to rest secretly. Just now, I called him and asked, "He Jinhan, you concealed it from the organization, right?" "No! No!" His little face was red, and his black eyes were rolling around. I said, "Stretch out your left arm." But he pouted, turned around, and didn't speak. "Come here! Let me see." As I spoke, I stood up to pull him, and he burst into tears.
　　My dear motherland, your children are all like this!
　　Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but yearn for the north, where there is the motherland, Chairman Mao, and happy people. A few days ago, my mother wrote to me saying: "The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway runs past our door, and the station is next door; after the Dujiangyan New Weir is opened, the water flows through our door into the fields; the school is built south of the station, so big! It can accommodate hundreds of people. Your third brother and sister are studying there. Our new house is also built. Your father and I live in the north room, your second brother and his wife live in the west room, and your sister and third brother live in the east room. The south room is waiting for you to come back from Korea. Now the work team is living there, saying that they are going to build a big factory here. After you come back, our hometown will definitely become unrecognizable to you."
　　I remembered when I joined the Volunteer Army last autumn, and when I departed from Chengdu for Korea, I saw the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway train speeding through the vast green rice fields in the plane; we flew over the towering, lush Bashan and Qinling Mountains, and flew over the beautiful and fertile plains of Guanzhong and southern Shanxi. I remembered Chairman Mao's kind face on Tiananmen Square on National Day, the sea of ​​colorful flags, and the endless stream of people. I remembered the clean train that carried us and the amiable and attentive attendants. I remembered the countless chimneys on the Yalu River... What a beautiful land, what happy people!
　　Mom, please rest assured! Motherland, please rest assured! Your sons are defending you in Korea.

    祖国，你的儿子在捍卫着你
    翟许有
    在我们志愿军侦察部队里，每一个侦察员都以马特洛索夫、黄继光、邱少云为标准来对待自己的生命。我该写谁呢？
    一天晚上，我们的班长李贵喜，去炸敌人的地堡，刚把炸药安上，导火索就被敌人打断了，他自己的胸上、腿上也负了伤。怎么办？在他后面，战士们正等着炸药一响，马上发起战斗；那时，炮兵立即发射压制炮火，工兵立即排除地雷、铁丝网，突击队、捕捉组立即扑向敌人，这样就会使一个排的“李承晚”粉身碎骨，就会有“活舌头”供出情况，就会实现立功计划，就会……想到这些，我们的班长忍着疼痛，爬着去点导火索。爬着，摸着，快到了，他攀着最后的一级石崖，一只手撑起身子，一只手抓着一束枯荆，本想猛一用力就可以上去，不幸，荆草断了，他从崖上滚下来，一直滚到铁丝网下，敌人又第二次打伤他的右手。这时，东方已经发白，眼看就要失掉战机，他又急，又气，又痛。燃发已经来不及，他想“拉发”（炸药装着燃、拉两用信管），可是距离这样近，会炸死自己。然而，他脑子里立刻出现了董存瑞舍身炸碉堡的英雄形象，于是就毫不犹豫地拉，拉，使劲用力，一只手拉不响，他就爬到悬崖边沿，带着导火索滚下崖去。炸药响了，炸飞的石头再一次砸伤他的头，强烈的震动使他耳聋声哑，血在他的脸上、胸上、手上、腿上冻结成冰。战斗正在发展，他拒绝同志们背他，自己爬回了阵地。我去看他，他躺在铺上笑着。我说：“同志，我一定给你请功。”突然他的脸色变了，他掏出自己的立功计划对我说：
    “我保证在这次战斗中捉一个活的，查明情况。断臂掉腿，也要战斗到底。”
    可是，现在医生要送走我们的班长。他一见担架，精神立刻格外紧张起来，嘴里不住地喊我，我就坐在他的身旁，他不顾伤口的疼痛，爬过来，倒在我的怀里，对着我的脸说：“首长，我就这样完了吗？……”我打断他的话：“你怎么这样说，很快就会好的。”他苦着脸，眼睛直盯着我：“首长，伤在我的身上，计划在我心里，我越想越害怕，我还能立功吗！还能见毛主席吗？我常这样想：有一天，我，或者我们几个人，坚守一条坑道，让敌人攻个十天半月也攻不下来；我也去到敌后搜集情况……可是现在一件也没有做。我对得起祖国吗？母亲问我，我怎样回答？祖国正在大建设，人人都贡献出自己的一切，我贡献了什么？”
    我的喉咙像塞上什么东西似的，涩巴巴的，吐不出声音来。因为我也知道，当一个人的理想没有完全实现的时候，他是多么痛苦啊！
    我又想起我们的测绘员马仁同志，他是一个大学生，朝鲜的战斗的日子使他坚强起来。他的日记上这样写着：“牛虻—保尔—马仁”。
    月前，他深入敌后测绘敌人的炮兵位置，在通过敌人阵地时，他和一个侦察员失散了，两个人坚持执行任务，凭着缴获敌人的给养，在丛林石岩中生活了一个多月。他们终于绘了图，捉了俘虏，了解了情况，圆满地完成了任务。在归途中，侦察员踏响了地雷，负了伤，马仁背着他转了四天。回来时，马仁已经瘦的不像人样了：满身疥疮，紫黑色的血淤在脚指上，夜盲也很严重。上级决定他去疗养。这时，如果你不知道同志们的心里燃烧着什么样的火焰，就可能使这个决定无效。因此，我就这样对马仁说：“去疗养吧！保尔不是也承认一个人没有权利损害自己的身体吗？就是马特洛索夫也是最爱自己的生命的。”这样，他才去了。五天以后，我突然接到护士写来的一封信，信上写道：“马仁同志牺牲了！同志，怪我无用！这样的人，什么力量也休想制止他停止斗争。他一听到特务空投到这里，我一把没拉住，他就跑出去了。刚到山根就碰上特务，他一枪打死一个，另外一个却打伤了他的手，枪也被打坏了，他就扑上去，和特务扭打在一起，摔在地下，滚到河里。马仁同志只有一只手呀，血还在一股劲地流，特务拚命地挣扎。最后他把特务诱到河心，按进冰窟，可是，我们的马仁同志也再没有起来……”
    我看完这封信，许久不知道说什么好。
    这时，我面前放着一堆地雷爆炸管。这些雷管是一个才十八岁的青年团员何金汉弄来的，他曾因为没被批准去当侦察员难受了几天。为了扫清进攻障碍，侦察员去排除地雷。把雷取走，会被敌人发觉，因此地雷要原地不动，雷管却要拿回来自己使用。小鬼也担任了这个任务，他一个人就交来二十多个雷管。最近，他几乎每天都要?两次河，到雪地里去摸，手也冻肿了。
    今天，他刚到雷区，敌人的小部队下来了，聪明的小鬼，立即隐蔽起来，把雷索握在手里，等敌人走近时，一下把雷拉响。因为距离太近，破片也炸伤了他的臂膀，他就用救急包扎起来，谁也没有告诉，回来后就偷偷地休息去了。刚才，我把他找来问道：“何金汉，隐瞒组织了吧？”“没有！没有！”小脸红着，黑眼珠滴溜溜地转。我说：“把左胳膊伸过来。”他却撅起嘴，扭转身子，不说话。“快过来呀！让我看看。”我说着就站起来去拉他，他竟哇的一声哭了。
    我亲爱的祖国啊，你的孩子们都是这样的人！
    看到这种情景，使我不禁心神北往，那里有祖国，有毛主席，有幸福的人民。前些天，我的母亲来信说：“成渝铁路就在我们的门前走过，车站就在隔壁；都江新堰开闸以后，水就经过咱们门口流到田里；学校修在车站南边，好大啊！能住几百人，你三弟和妹妹就在那里念书。咱家的新院子也盖好了，我和你爸爸住北屋，西屋里住着你二弟俩口，东屋里就是你妹妹和三弟，南屋等着你从朝鲜回来住，现在住着工作队，说是要在这里修个大工厂。你回来以后，咱们的家乡保管变得你不认识了。”
    我想起去秋我参加志愿军，从成都起程来朝鲜时，在飞机上看见成渝铁路的列车在广阔的绿油油的稻田中奔驰而过；我们飞过巍峨屹立、林木丛生的巴山、秦岭，飞过关中、晋南的美丽富饶的平原。我想起国庆节天安门上毛主席慈祥的面孔，万紫千红的旗帜的海，无穷无尽的人流。我想起载送我们的洁净的列车和那和霭殷勤的招待员。我想起鸭绿江边数不清的烟囱……多么美好的土地，多么幸福的人民啊！
    妈妈，请你放心吧！祖国，请你放心吧！你的儿子在朝鲜捍卫着你。
