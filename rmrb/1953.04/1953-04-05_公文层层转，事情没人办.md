    Official Documents Passed Around in Circles, No One Handles the Matter
    Zhang Weiqi
    The masses write letters requesting a solution to find markets for fresh eggs
    Zhuzhou, Hunan, is a central hub for the export of fresh eggs, with 141 merchants engaged in the fresh egg business. In the spring of 1952, many egg merchants in the area found themselves unable to export the fresh eggs they had purchased, and farmers had large quantities of fresh eggs that no one would buy. Resolving the problem of finding markets for fresh eggs became an urgent demand of the local people. Although the egg merchants had requested local trade departments to resolve this issue, they received no response. Later, after discussions by the Food Second Branch of the city's Shop Employees' Union and egg industry workers, 27 people jointly wrote a letter, which was sent to the People's Daily on April 6, 1952, requesting help in solving the problem of marketing fresh eggs.
    Trade authorities pass around the document for two months
    The People's Daily Readers' Letters Group forwarded this letter from the masses to the former Central Ministry of Trade's Foreign Trade Bureau. The leading comrades of the Foreign Trade Bureau did not study solutions to the problem themselves, nor did they designate anyone to be responsible for handling the reply, but instead forwarded the original letter to the Trade Management Office. The Trade Management Office then forwarded the letter to the China Animal Products Company. The China Animal Products Company then passed it on to the Central South China Animal Products Company, asking them to investigate and handle it in conjunction with the Wuhan Foreign Trade Administration Bureau. The Central South China Animal Products Company then passed it on to the Hunan Provincial Animal Products Company, asking them to coordinate with the Changsha Foreign Trade Administration Sub-bureau to handle it. However, the Changsha Foreign Trade Administration Sub-bureau neither sent anyone to Zhuzhou to resolve the issue, nor did they explain to the Zhuzhou egg industry workers the reasons for the reduction in foreign sales and methods for organizing domestic sales. They only discussed the difficulties of foreign sales with the Hunan Provincial Animal Products Company. Based on this, the Hunan Provincial Animal Products Company wrote a report to the Central South China Animal Products Company, which then forwarded the report verbatim to the Central Ministry of Trade, which then passed it on to the Foreign Trade Bureau, which then passed it on to the Trade Management Office. After this back-and-forth, lasting more than two months, the Trade Management Office of the Foreign Trade Bureau neither resolved the problem nor replied to the People's Daily, but instead passed the report on to the China Animal Products Company for handling.
    In the end, there was still no result
    The People's Daily Readers' Letters Group, having waited a long time for a reply, sent three consecutive letters to the former Central Ministry of Trade on May 10, May 27, and June 16 of last year, urging them to respond. However, these letters of inquiry did not attract the attention of the Central Ministry of Trade. They neither investigated the reasons for the slow handling of the problem, nor did they come up with a way to quickly resolve it, but continued to indifferently turn the letters of inquiry into just another "traveler," "traveling" down the road as described above. The People's Daily Readers' Letters Group's letter of inquiry of June 16 of last year was marked "urgent," but the document section of the Foreign Trade Bureau of the Central Ministry of Trade, without asking any questions, passed it on to the Planning Office of the Foreign Trade Bureau. Because the Planning Office did not understand what the problem was, they did not know how to handle it, but they responsibly called the China Animal Products Company and asked for the original letter from the masses to be returned. At the same time, they sent a letter to the Changsha Foreign Trade Sub-bureau, asking it to investigate the situation of the Zhuzhou egg industry. The Changsha Foreign Trade Sub-bureau wrote a report on July 15. After receiving this report, the Central Ministry of Trade passed it on to the Foreign Trade Bureau, which passed it on to the Trade Management Office, which passed it on to the Planning Office. The Planning Office made two suggestions and passed them on to the Trade Management Office, which then passed them on to the China Animal Products Company on July 29 of last year for further investigation and handling.
    What was the result? The document passed through nine units, involved sixteen instances of correspondence, more than four hundred procedures, and took more than three months. The extent of the fresh egg losses was not yet investigated, the marketing problem was not yet resolved, but the document was filed away, and the problem was left unresolved.
    We must never rely on signing documents to lead work
    From the process of handling this letter from the people, it can be clearly seen that some working comrades in our agencies are relying solely on "signing documents" to lead work and solve problems. They have adopted an irresponsible attitude towards problems that the people urgently demand to be resolved, and they treat their work as a "football," kicking it around. From this, we can also see how important the inspection system is. If it were not for this anti-bureaucracy campaign and the inspection work being carried out, this matter would not have been discovered. We can imagine how many other problems that should be dealt with are silently buried in piles of documents!
    If the method of signing documents and passing them around layer by layer had not been adopted for this letter from the people, but instead a method of conscientiously taking responsibility for solving the problem had been adopted, for example, if the Foreign Trade Bureau had studied a handling principle and sent the letter from the masses directly to the Changsha Foreign Trade Administration Sub-bureau, urging the bureau to assign a dedicated person to be responsible for solving the problem, and at the same time written a reply with the solution to the People's Daily for publication, the problem could have been solved in a few days. There would have been no need for the document to travel, let alone be left unresolved.
    Therefore, it is very important to improve the bureaucratic working methods of our leading organs, establish an attitude of concern and responsibility towards work and the interests of the people among every comrade, strictly establish a system of regular work inspections, and thoroughly overcome the bureaucratic work style of not solving problems.

    公文层层转，事情没人办
    张维奇
    群众写信要求给鲜蛋找销路
    湖南株州是鲜蛋出口的集中地，有一百四十一家经营鲜蛋的商户。一九五二年春季，当地许多蛋商收购的鲜蛋不能出口，农民手中的大批鲜蛋，也无人收购了。解决鲜蛋的销路问题，成为当地群众急迫的要求。蛋商虽曾向当地贸易部门要求解决这个问题，但没有得到答复。后来经过该市店员工会食品二分会及蛋业职工们的商讨，由二十七人联名写了一封信，于一九五二年四月六日寄给人民日报，请求帮助解决鲜蛋的销路问题。
    贸易机关层层批转历时两月
    人民日报读者来信组将这封群众来信转给前中央贸易部国外贸易司。国外贸易司的负责同志自己既不研究这个问题的解决办法，也不确定由谁负责处理答复，就将原信转给贸易管理处。贸易管理处又把这封信转给中国畜产公司。中国畜产公司又批转给中南区畜产公司，要他们会同武汉对外贸易管理局调查处理。中南区畜产公司又批转给湖南省畜产公司，要他们与长沙对外贸易管理分局连系处理。但长沙对外贸易管理分局既不派人到株州去解决问题，也没有向株州蛋业职工讲清外销减少的原因及组织内销的办法，只向湖南省畜产公司谈了谈外销困难的情况。湖南省畜产公司据此写了一个报告给中南区畜产公司，中南区畜产公司又把报告照转给中央贸易部，中央贸易部又批给国外贸易司，国外贸易司又批给贸易管理处。这样转了一个来回，经过了两个多月，国外贸易司贸易管理处既不解决问题，也不答复人民日报，又把报告批转给中国畜产公司办理。
    最后还是没有结果
    人民日报读者来信组久等不到复信，曾在去年五月十日，五月二十七日，六月十六日连续向前中央贸易部发了三次信催问。但这些催问的信并没有引起中央贸易部的注意。他们既没有检查问题处理迟缓的原因，也没有研究出迅速解决问题的办法，仍然是不关痛痒地将催问的信又变成了一纸“旅客”，按照前面所说的道路“旅行”下去。人民日报读者来信组去年六月十六日的催问信是“急件”，中央贸易部国外贸易司文书科接到这个“急件”，不加查问，就批给国外贸易司计划处。计划处因不了解是什么问题，不知如何处理，但是负责地给中国畜产公司打电话，将群众来信的原文要回；同时又给长沙对外贸易分局去信，让其调查株州蛋业情况。长沙对外贸易分局于七月十五日写来一个报告。中央贸易部接到这个报告后又批给国外贸易司，国外贸易司又批给贸易管理处，贸易管理处又转给计划处，计划处提了两个意见又转给贸易管理处，贸易管理处于去年七月二十九日又批给中国畜产公司继续调查处理。
    结果是怎样呢？公文经过九个单位、行文十六次、四百多道手续，费时三个多月，鲜蛋损失情况尚未调查清楚，销路问题还未解决，公文却归了档案，问题不了了之。
    绝不能靠签署文件领导工作
    从处理这一件人民来信的过程，可以很清楚的看出，我们一些机关中的工作同志，是单靠“签署文件”领导工作和解决问题的，他们对人民迫切要求解决的问题采取了不负责任的态度，他们把自己的工作当成“皮球”，踢来踢去。从这里也可以看出检查制度是如何重要，如果不是这次开展反官僚主义斗争，进行检查工作，这件事情是还不会被发现的。我们可以想像，不知还有多少应该处理的问题，无声无息地被埋葬在公文堆中呢！
    对这件人民来信如果不采取签署文件、层层批转的办法，而采取切实负责解决问题的办法，例如由国外贸易司研究一个处理原则，将群众来信直接寄给长沙对外贸易管理分局，督促该局指定专人负责解决这个问题；同时将解决办法写一复信交给人民日报发表，用不了几天就能够把问题解决了。根本不需要公文旅行，更不应该不了了之。
    因此，改进我们领导机关的文牍主义的工作方法，树立每个同志对工作、对人民利益关心负责的态度，严格地建立起定期检查工作的制度，彻底克服不解决问题的官僚主义作风，是非常重要的。
