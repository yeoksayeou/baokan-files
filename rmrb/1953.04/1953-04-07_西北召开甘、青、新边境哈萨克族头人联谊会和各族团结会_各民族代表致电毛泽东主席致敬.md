Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 6th: The Northwest Administrative Committee convened a Joint Conference of Kazakh Leaders from the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Border Regions, and an Ethnic Solidarity Conference of the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Border Regions in Lanzhou from March 23rd to April 3rd. A total of 136 representatives from all strata of the Kazakh, Mongol, Tibetan, Sarikoli Uyghur, Hui, Uyghur, and Han ethnic groups from the three-province border regions attended the meeting.

Ma Hongbin, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee, Tan Weixu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Northwest Administrative Committee, Xue Xiangchen, Member of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Northwest Administrative Committee, and responsible persons from relevant departments of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces spoke at the meeting. Ma Hongbin said, "Chairman Mao has told us that we must strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups. Unity is happiness. Our people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest have deeply realized in their own practical lives that only by uniting and following Chairman Mao and the Communist Party forever can we live a happier life." Xue Xiangchen gave a detailed explanation of the government's policies in pastoral areas of not carrying out land reform, not dividing grasslands, not dividing livestock, not carrying out rent reduction, resolutely implementing the protection and development of animal husbandry economy, respecting the customs and habits of minority ethnic groups, and protecting freedom of religious belief.

During the discussions, Kazakh leaders and representatives of all ethnic groups spoke fully. They all expressed that they would adhere to the spirit of national unity, help each other, make concessions, and develop together in the future. After full consultation and discussion, the agreement on strengthening national unity and resettling the Kazakhs was adopted. Regarding the issue of Kazakh residential and grazing areas, the Mongols on the Gansu-Qinghai border voluntarily allocated part of their grasslands to the Kazakhs, giving the Kazakhs fixed residential and grazing areas. The meeting also decided to help the Kazakhs establish regional autonomy. Considering the long-term displacement of the Kazakhs and the difficulties in their lives and production, the People's Government decided to allocate funds to help them establish homes and gradually develop their economy and culture. The Kazakh leaders were very grateful for the care and help of the People's Government and the representatives of all ethnic groups. Atongbaike said: In the past, we did not approach the People's Government because we were deceived by bad people and listened to rumors. Now, the People's Government not only does not hold us accountable for the past but also helps us overcome various difficulties, and all fraternal ethnic groups can understand us, making us truly feel the warmth of the big family of the motherland. In the future, we will definitely unite with all ethnic groups under the leadership of Chairman Mao, help each other, and develop together. Representatives of the Mongol, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups stated in their speeches that they were willing to give the Kazakhs active support and assistance. They believed that the settlement of the Kazakhs was not only the happiness of the Kazakh people but also the happiness of all ethnic groups on the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang border.

Note: The Kazakhs scattered on the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang border regions consist of fourteen large and small tribes, totaling about three thousand people. Before liberation, they could not bear Sheng Shicai's cruel oppression and fled from Xinjiang to the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang border regions. For more than ten years, they had been living a wandering life without fixed residential and grazing areas. Due to the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Kazakhs and other ethnic groups on the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang border regions had been constantly fighting in the past. After liberation, the Kazakhs, deceived by the rumors of Usiman, a spy of American imperialism, and Janim Khan, a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, continued to live a wandering life in the deep mountains. After three years of efforts by the People's Government, the Kazakhs began to settle down in Guolimao in Dulan Autonomous Region of Qinghai and Changcaogou, Mahai, and Haizi in Subei Autonomous Region of Gansu last August. The People's Government has provided them with large quantities of flour, tea, cloth, tents, etc. as relief.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 6th: All 136 representatives of the Joint Conference of Kazakh Leaders and Ethnic Solidarity from the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Border Regions sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to express their respect at the closing of the meeting on April 3rd. The telegram is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

Our Joint Conference of Kazakh Leaders and Ethnic Solidarity from the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Border Regions was held in Lanzhou on March 23rd under the direct auspices of the Northwest Administrative Committee and successfully concluded today. 136 representatives from seven ethnic groups, including Kazakh, Mongol, Tibetan, Sarikoli Uyghur, Uyghur, Hui, and Han, participated in this meeting. Throughout the meeting, we fully promoted the spirit of unity, friendship, and democratic consultation, discussed issues related to strengthening unity and mutual assistance among ethnic groups in the border region, properly resettling the Kazakh people, and jointly developing the economy and culture of all ethnic groups, and reached unanimous agreements. This is a major victory in the cause of unity of all ethnic groups in our Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang border region. We deeply know that this victory is inseparable from your great and correct ethnic policy. All of our representatives unanimously express our heartfelt gratitude and high respect to you, and resolutely assure you that in the future, the people of all ethnic groups in our Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang border region will unite more closely under your banner and strive to build our great motherland and create our happy and beautiful life.

We wish you good health and longevity!

        All Representatives of the Joint Conference of Kazakh Leaders and Ethnic Solidarity from the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Border Regions

    西北召开甘、青、新边境哈萨克族头人联谊会和各族团结会
    各民族代表致电毛泽东主席致敬
    【新华社兰州六日电】西北行政委员会自三月二十三日至四月三日在兰州召开甘肃、青海、新疆边境哈萨克族头人联谊会和甘肃、青海、新疆边境各民族团结会。参加会议的有三省边境的哈萨克族头人和蒙、藏、撒里维吾尔、回、维吾尔、汉等族各阶层代表共一百三十六人。
    西北行政委员会副主席马鸿宾、西北行政委员会副秘书长谈维煦、西北行政委员会民族事务委员会委员薛向晨和甘、青、新三省有关部门的负责人都在会上讲话。马鸿宾说：“毛主席告诉我们，要加强各族团结，团结就是幸福，我们西北各族人民已在自己的实际生活中，深刻地体会到了我们各族人民只有团结起来永远跟着毛主席和共产党走，才能过更幸福的生活。”薛向晨就人民政府在牧区不进行土地改革、不分草原、不分牲畜、不进行减租，坚决执行保护发展畜牧经济和尊重少数民族风俗习惯以及保护宗教信仰自由的政策，作了详细的说明。
    在讨论中，哈萨克族头人和各族代表都充分发言。他们都表示：今后要本着民族团结的精神，互助互让，共同发展。经过充分协商和讨论后，通过了加强民族团结和安置哈族的协议。关于哈族居住和放牧区域问题，甘、青边境的蒙族自愿将自己的草地分一部分给哈族，使哈族有固定的居住和放牧区域。会议并决定帮助哈族建立区域自治；根据哈族长期流散，生活、生产的困难情况，人民政府决定拨款帮助他们建立家园和逐步发展其经济、文化。哈族头人对人民政府和各民族代表对他们的关怀与帮助，非常感激。阿同拜克说：过去我们因为受坏人欺骗和听信谣言，没有靠近人民政府，现在人民政府不仅不咎既往，而且帮助我们克服各种困难，各兄弟民族对我们也能谅解，使我们真正体会到祖国大家庭的温暖。今后我们一定在毛主席领导下，和各民族团结一致，互相帮助，共同发展。蒙、藏等族代表在讲话中，都表示愿意给哈族以积极的支持和帮助。他们认为哈族安居下来，不仅是哈族人民的幸福，而且也是甘、青、新边境各民族的幸福。
    按：流散在甘、青、新边境的哈萨克族，共有大小十四个部落，约三千人。解放前他们不堪盛世才的残酷压迫，由新疆逃至甘、青、新边境，十多年来一直过着流浪的生活，没有固定的居住和放牧地区。由于蒋介石、马步芳反动派的挑拨，哈族与甘、青、新边境其他民族过去不断发生械斗。解放后哈族因受美帝国主义间谍乌斯满和蒋匪特务贾尼木汗的造谣欺骗，仍继续在深山里过着流浪生活。三年来经人民政府多次争取，哈族始于去年八月在青海都兰自治区的郭里峁和甘肃肃北自治区的长草沟、马海、海子等地安居下来。人民政府曾救济他们大批的面粉、茶叶、布匹、帐篷等。【新华社兰州六日电】甘肃、青海、新疆边境哈萨克族头人联谊会和各族团结会全体代表一百三十六人，在四月三日会议闭幕时，打电报向毛主席致敬。电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们甘、青、新边境哈萨克族头人联谊会和各族团结会，在西北行政委员会的直接主持下，于三月二十三日在兰州召开，今天胜利闭幕了。参加这次会议的有哈萨克、蒙、藏、撒里维吾尔、维吾尔、回、汉等七个民族的代表一百三十六人。在整个会议的过程中，我们充分发扬了团结友爱和民主协商的精神，讨论了有关加强边境各民族之间的团结互助，妥善安置哈族人民以及共同发展各民族的经济、文化等问题，并且获得了一致的协议。这是我们甘、青、新边境各民族团结事业中一个重大胜利。我们深深知道：这个胜利的得来，是和你的伟大正确的民族政策分不开的。我们全体代表一致向你表示衷心的感激和崇高的敬意，并且向你坚决保证：今后我们甘、青、新边境各民族人民一定更加紧密地团结在你的旗帜下，为建设我们伟大的祖国和创造我们幸福美好的生活而奋斗。
    祝你身体健康，万寿无疆！
            甘、青、新边境哈族头人联谊会和各族团结
                会全体代表一九五三年四月三日
