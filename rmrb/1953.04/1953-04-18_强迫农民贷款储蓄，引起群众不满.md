Forcing Farmers to Take Out Loans and Savings, Causing Public Dissatisfaction
Yao Zijin

Recently, the inspection team dispatched by the Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while inspecting work in the Baichou Nanzhuang Village, Fifth District, Guangling County, discovered that bank staff were forcing farmers to take out loans and savings, "completing" two tasks in one day and night. The course of events was as follows:

On June 24th of last year, Wang Qiantang, a cadre from the Fifth District Branch of the People's Bank of China, Guangling County, went to Baichou Nanzhuang Village to mobilize farmers to deposit money. That evening, he convened a mass meeting, calling on the masses to deposit. However, he did not investigate the needs of the masses, nor did he study whether it was possible, and he did not explain the reasons for depositing. Therefore, the masses were unwilling to deposit. When Wang Qiantang saw that no one was depositing, he grabbed the Party members and cadres, asking them to "take the lead". But the Party members and cadres had not been ideologically convinced either, and they were unwilling to deposit. Therefore, Wang Qiantang directed the militia to guard the doors and watch the people; and issued an order: "Whoever does not deposit will not be allowed to go home." Several farmers did not attend the meeting, and Wang Qiantang sent people to grab them door to door.

Seeing that they could not get away without agreeing to deposit, several people expressed their willingness to deposit: one said he would deposit 10,000, another said he would deposit 8,000. As soon as someone agreed, Wang Qiantang sent the militia to escort him out and let him go home. In this way, from dusk to the fifth watch (around 3-5 AM), they endured the whole night, and only forced 86 people to express their willingness to deposit, with a total deposit amount of 2.75 million. Those who did not agree to deposit were not released until dawn.

Afterwards, Wang Qiantang led people to collect deposits. After collecting for a long time, only 920,000 were collected from fourteen families. The rest said they had no money. This infuriated Wang Qiantang, but he thought that using the same method as last night would not work, so he came up with a method: let the farmers first report how much they wanted to deposit, and then report how much they wanted to borrow. One deposit and one loan offset each other. In this way, the farmers did not pay a single penny, but saved several million, and the bank did not need cash, but issued several million in loans. Both deposits and loans were done without seeing any money, and it was just the bank staff writing a few lines of accounts and issuing a few deposit slips and loan slips.

Wang Qiantang returned to the district and made a report, and the district also praised him for being short on time, having many methods, being strong in ability, and achieving great results.

What achievements did Wang Qiantang have? Let's take a look at the accounts:

Everyone knows that banks conduct deposit and loan business to concentrate idle funds and support agricultural production. However, Wang Qiantang used such a bad method in Baichou Nanzhuang Village, allowing farmers to take out loans and savings. In reality, not a single penny was deposited, and not half a penny was lent out. How can it be said that funds have been adjusted and production has been supported!

From the numbers in the two sets of accounts, there are indeed some "achievements", but such false numbers are not liked by anyone except those bureaucrats.

It is said that the interest earned on deposits is relatively small, while the interest paid on loans is relatively large. In this way, Wang Qiantang used this method to let the farmers pay some interest out of thin air. More seriously, the farmers were locked up all night, which affected production and damaged the relationship between the government and the people.

    强迫农民贷款储蓄，引起群众不满
    姚子锦
    最近中共雁北地委派出的检查组，在广灵县五区百町南庄村检查工作时，发现银行工作人员强迫农民贷款储蓄，一昼夜间“完成”两个任务的事。事情的经过是这样的：
    去年六月二十四日，中国人民银行广灵县五区营业所的干部王千堂，到百町南庄村发动农民群众存款。他当天晚上召开了群众大会，号召群众存款。但他没有调查群众的需要，也没有研究可能不可能，更没讲清存款的道理，因此群众都不愿存款。王千堂一看没人存款，就抓住党员和干部，要他们“带头”。但党员和干部的思想也没有搞通，也不愿存款，于是，王千堂就指挥着民兵，把门的把门，看人的看人；并且发布命令道：“谁不存款，就不让回家。”有几户农民没有到会，王千堂就派人去挨门抓来。
    农民看见不答应存款就下不了台，就有几个人表示愿意存款：这个说存一万，那个说存八千。谁应承一声，王千堂就派民兵把他送出门去，让他回家。这样从黄昏到五更，整整熬了一夜，才逼出八十六个表示要存款的，存款数字是二百七十五万元。没答应存款的人，直到天明才被释放回家了。
    接着，王千堂领着人去收存款。收了老半天，只收了十四家的九十二万元，其余的人都说没有钱。这可把王千堂气坏啦，但他一想，再用昨天晚上那套办法是不灵了，于是就想出一个方法：让农民先报存款若干，再报贷款若干，一存一贷，两下抵清。这样，农民群众不出半文钱就储蓄了几百万元，银行也用不着现款，就发放了几百万元贷款。存款贷款都不见钱，就是银行工作人员写几行帐，开几张存款单和贷款单。
    王千堂回到区上作了报告，区上还表扬他：时间短、办法多、能力强、成绩大。
    王千堂有什么成绩呢？不妨算一下帐：
    谁都知道，银行举办存款贷款业务，是为了集中闲散资金，扶助农民生产。可是王千堂在百町南庄村用这种恶劣的办法，让农民贷款储蓄，实际上是一文没存进，半文没贷出。怎么能说是调剂了资金，扶助了生产呢！
    从两本帐上的数目字看来，倒是有一些“成绩”，可是这样的假数目字，除了那些官僚主义者以外，是没人喜爱它的。
    据说，存款得的利息较小，贷款付的利息较大。这样，王千堂用这种办法，就凭空让农民群众出了若干利钱。更严重的是把农民群众关起熬了一夜，影响了生产，破坏了政府与人民群众的联系。
