Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, Dispatch from Moscow (TASS, April 10th): As the Japanese Diet election draws nearer, the political struggle in Japan intensifies daily.

In the upcoming election, the competition mainly lies between two camps. One is the conservative camp, which includes Yoshida's Liberal Party, the "New Liberal Party" led by Hatoyama, the Reform Party led by Shigemitsu Mamoru, and some other right-wing groups. This camp is backed by large financial and industrial capital. Opposing this camp is the camp of democratic parties, including the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party, which are supported by some labor unions.

Currently, the registration of candidates for both houses has concluded. According to Japanese radio reports, 1,042 candidates will compete for the 466 seats in the House of Representatives, and 460 candidates will compete for the seats in the House of Councillors. 128 Councillors will be elected in this election.

The issue of Japanese rearmament is a fundamental question in this election campaign. The "New Liberal Party" led by Hatoyama and the Reform Party have both openly expressed their support for rearmament, while Yoshida's Liberal Party has adopted a vote-grabbing campaign tactic, attempting to conceal its true stance on the issue of rearmament. The right-wing Socialist Party also supports rearmament.

The Japanese Communist Party has proposed that all parties opposing rearmament form a united front. This proposal has been endorsed by the Labor-Farmer Party. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions (Sanbetsu), and some other labor unions have decided to support candidates who oppose rearmament. The Communist Party's campaign program is: to fight for the democratic rights and national independence of the Japanese working people. Communist House of Representatives candidate Miyashita said in a campaign speech: The Communist Party demands the abolition of the San Francisco "Peace Treaty," the "Security Treaty," and the "Administrative Agreement," because the purpose of these treaties is to prolong the American occupation of Japan. The Communist Party demands the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and the development of trade with all countries on the basis of freedom and equality.

The democratic forces in Japan are campaigning under exceptionally difficult circumstances. The ruling group and the entire conservative party camp are engaging in shameless slander against the Communist Party and other progressive figures, attempting to prevent them from achieving victory in the election.

During the campaign, many candidates from the various conservative parties have committed numerous violations of election law. According to official materials released by the National Rural Police Headquarters, to date, there have been 85 incidents of violations of election law, with 137 people arrested, many of whom have been charged with bribing voters.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese democratic farmers' organization, the Japan Farmers' Association, held a standing committee meeting on March 20th to discuss the election struggle strategy. The meeting decided to elect candidates who safeguard the interests of workers and peasants and strive for independence and freedom. The meeting also decided to use the election struggle to vigorously establish and strengthen the organization of the Japan Farmers' Association.

Many candidates from democratic parties such as the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor Party, and the Socialist Party Reconstruction faction, as well as non-party figures such as Yoshitaro Hirano and Masaharu Hatanaka, have been recommended and supported by the Japan Farmers' Association. Kubota Yutaka, Chairman of the Japan Farmers' Association, is also participating in the House of Representatives election.

    日本国会选举期临近
    进步力量与保守阵营展开紧张斗争
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社十日讯：日本国会的选举期愈来愈近，日本的政治斗争也一天天变得更紧张了。
    在这次即将来到的选举中，主要是两个阵营的竞争，一个是保守党的阵营，它包括了吉田的自由党、以鸠山为首的“新自由党”、以重光葵为首的改进党和一些其他右派集团，这个阵营的后盾是大金融资本和工业资本。与这个阵营对立的是包括共产党和劳农党在内的民主党派的阵营，他们得到一些工会的拥护。
    现在，两院候选人的登记已经结束了。据日本电台报道：将有一千零四十二个候选人参加众议院四百六十六个议员席次的竞争，参加参议员竞选的有四百六十人。在这次选举中要选出的参议员为一百二十八人。
    日本重整军备的问题，是这次竞选运动中的基本问题，鸠山领导的“新自由党”和改进党都曾公开地表示赞成重整军备，吉田的自由党则采取了笼络人心的竞选手段，企图掩饰它在重整军备问题上的真正主张。右派社会党也赞成重整军备。
    日本共产党提出了建议，主张由所有反对重整军备的党派组成统一战线。这个建议已得到了劳农党的拥护。日本工会总评议会、全日本产业别工会会议和其他一些工会都已决定要支持反对重整军备的候选人。共产党的竞选纲领是：为日本劳动人民的民主权利和民族独立而斗争。共产党众议院候选人宫下在一次竞选演说中说：共产党要求废除旧金山片面“和约”、“安全条约”和“行政协定”，因为这些条约的目的都是要延长美国对日本的占领。共产党要求缔结一个全面和约，并在自由平等的基础上发展和所有国家之间的贸易。
    日本的民主力量是在异常困难的环境下竞选的。统治集团和整个保守党派的阵营正在对共产党和其他进步人士进行无耻的诬蔑，想阻碍他们在选举中得到胜利。
    在竞选运动中，各保守党派的候选人已发生许多违反选举法的事件。据国家地方警察本部所发表的官方材料说，至今为止，已发生八十五起违反选举法的事件，有一百三十七个人被捕，其中许多人被控犯了贿赂选民的罪行。
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：日本的民主农民组织——日本农民协会在三月二十日召开常任委员会会议，讨论大选斗争方针。会议决定选举维护工人和农民的利益、为独立和自由而努力的候选人。会议并决定要通过大选斗争，大力建立和加强日本农民协会的组织。
    日本共产党、劳动党、社会党再建派等民主党派的许多候选人以及无党无派的平野义太郎、畑中政春等，都受到日本农民协会的推荐和支持。日本农民协会主席久保田丰也参加众议员竞选。
