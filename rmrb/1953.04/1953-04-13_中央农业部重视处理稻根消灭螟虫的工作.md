    The Central Ministry of Agriculture Emphasizes Work on Handling Rice Roots to Eliminate Rice Stem Borers
    A letter from the Plant Protection Department of the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture: In the "Abstracts of Readers' Letters" column on March 27th, Comrade Shu Zhihao suggested: The people's governments in rice-growing areas should promptly guide farmers to quickly destroy the dug-up rice roots to completely eliminate rice stem borers that harm rice crops. This is completely correct. Last winter, when we sent cadres to East China and Central South to inspect the work of digging up and destroying rice roots, we also discovered that the dug-up rice roots had not been destroyed in a timely manner, and we made a "make-up class" suggestion to the local areas. In January of this year, we also issued a "Circular on Thoroughly Handling Rice Root Work" and distributed it to rice-growing areas for research and reference. Recently, during the spring plowing inspection, we have also included this work as one of the inspection contents, so as to promptly correct the situation in some areas where the dug-up rice roots have not been handled in a timely manner.

    中央农业部重视处理稻根消灭螟虫的工作
    中央人民政府农业部植物保护司来信：三月二十七日“读者来信摘要”栏中，舒志浩同志建议：各有水稻地区的人民政府应及时指导农民赶紧把挖出的稻根毁掉，以彻底消灭危害水稻的螟虫。这是完全正确的。去年冬季我们派干部到华东、中南检查掘毁稻根工作时，也曾发现已掘出的稻根没及时毁掉的情况，已向当地提出“补课”建议。今年一月我们又曾发出“关于彻底处理稻根工作的通报”，分发水稻区研究参考。最近春耕检查中，我们又将这一工作列为检查内容之一，以及时纠正某些地区未及时处理掘出的稻根的情况。
