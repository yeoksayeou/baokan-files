Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 9th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee met on the morning of April 7th, after the Easter holiday, to continue discussing the proposal put forward by the United States on March 27th, which had not been concluded, namely the "Impartial Investigation of Accusations Regarding the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by United States Forces."

Before resuming the debate, the Political Committee unanimously agreed to the suggestion of the Political Committee Chairman, Muñoz, to consider the Burmese government's accusation of aggression by Kuomintang elements after the committee discussed the Polish proposal on "Eliminating the Threat of Another World War and Strengthening International Peace and Friendly Cooperation." It has been decided that the Polish proposal will be discussed immediately after the current issue is concluded.

The representatives of Peru, Belaunde, Greece, Kyrou, Belgium, van Langenhove, and Indonesia, Palar, spoke in succession.

Soviet representative Zorin then spoke, saying: The United States does not want to study the essence of the question it raises, because it opposes the participation of relevant parties in this discussion. The United States and its supporters must understand that it is impossible to completely disregard the facts that have been proven by many documents (including the confessions of two senior U.S. military officers). The United States should ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Zorin said that this measure would strengthen international trust. However, a negative and ambiguous answer cannot satisfy the Soviet Union and world public opinion. Zorin concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation cannot support the U.S. proposal, especially because the discussion of this issue is being conducted in a blatant violation of international law.

After the representatives of Turkey and Uruguay spoke, the Political Committee adjourned. It will continue to meet on the morning of April 8th.

    联大政委会继续讨论关于调查美军进行细菌战的美国提案
    苏联代表佐林揭露美国违反国际法的行为
   【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在过了复活节假期后，于四月七日上午开会，继续讨论在三月二十七日开始而未讨论完毕的议案，这就是美国所提出的“公正调查关于美国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”案。
    在恢复辩论之前，政治委员会一致同意政治委员会主席慕尼兹的建议，决定在讨论了波兰提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作”案之后，委员会将考虑缅甸政府控告国民党分子的侵略行动案，波兰的议案已决定在目前的问题讨论完毕之后接着讨论。
    秘鲁代表贝朗德、希腊代表基罗、比利时代表范朗歇诺夫和印度尼西亚代表巴拉相继发言。
    苏联代表佐林接着发言，他说：美国并不希望研究它所提出的这个问题的本质，因为它反对有关方面参加这个讨论。美国及其支持者必须明白：要完全不顾已为许多文件（包括两个美国高级军官的供词）所证明了的事实是不可能的。美国应该批准一九二五年的日内瓦议定书。佐林说，这个措施将加强国际间的信任。但是，一种消极的与含糊其词的回答，是不能满足苏联和世界舆论的。佐林最后说，苏联代表团不能支持美国的提案，特别是因为这个问题的讨论是在一种明目张胆地违反国际法的情况下进行的。
    在土耳其及乌拉圭代表发言之后政治委员会宣布休会。它将在四月八日上午继续开会。
