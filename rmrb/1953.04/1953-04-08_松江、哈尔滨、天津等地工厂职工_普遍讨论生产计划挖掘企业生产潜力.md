Factory Workers in Songjiang, Harbin, Tianjin and Other Places
Universally Discuss Production Plans and Tap Enterprise Production Potential

    All state-owned factories in Songjiang Province and Harbin City have comprehensively begun discussing the 1953 production plans. A few factories have formulated action plans, are signing collective contracts, and are launching patriotic labor competitions.
    Due to the close leadership, timely instructions, and inspections of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee and the Harbin Municipal Committee, the majority of factories' production plan discussions are being carried out in a prepared and led manner. Factories have generally adopted or will adopt the following steps and methods: 1. Conduct in-depth ideological education on the "Three Major Tasks" of the country in 1953, organize cadres to study documents, unify thinking, and identify the key issues of their respective units; 2. Mobilize employees to find solutions and tap potential around key issues; 3. Formulate action plans for individuals, groups, workshops, and the entire factory; 4. Sign collective contracts and launch labor competitions. During the discussion process, the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee and the Harbin Municipal Committee promptly convened factory party member cadre conferences and symposiums, criticized various conservative and backward ideas, and introduced the experience of the 53 Factory in discussing plans and the Harbin Railway Factory in formulating technical organizational measures plans, which greatly promoted the development of the work.
    The work of discussing plans in various factories was launched after criticizing various conservative ideas. For example, the leading cadres of the Harbin Cement Plant initially believed that "last year's production increase and conservation plan was not completed because the plan was set too high; this year, we must learn from last year's lessons, and the plan should not be set too high." Later, they criticized conservative ideas, deeply mobilized employees to discuss the plan, and by early March, 571 solutions had emerged, allowing the annual state plan to be completed 20 days ahead of schedule. The leading cadres of a certain factory initially believed that the potential had already been exhausted, and the factory director had even requested the bureau to reduce production tasks. Later, after investigation and research, it was found that there was still a lot of potential in production, so they mobilized employees to find solutions, which solved most of the key problems, and the leading cadres gained confidence in completing the state plan.
    In leading the discussion of production plans, factories generally seized the key issues of the whole factory as well as the workshops and groups. The number of solutions appearing in factories this year is not as many as last year, but the proportion of solutions that solve key problems is quite large, which is one of the characteristics of this year's production plan discussion. For example, the Harbin Railway Factory had a total of 985 solutions by early March, of which 118 were for solving key problems. The leaders of the third workshop of the Mechanical Plant No. 10 pointed out the four major key issues of the workshop, mobilized employees to "grab topics" and find solutions, and have now found 68 solutions, which have been combined into 17 solutions after absorbing the strengths and weaknesses of each, which can solve three major key problems.
    However, there are still some shortcomings in the current work of discussing plans. Some factories and mines have a formalistic work style, do not make preparations, are eager to achieve quick results, and hastily conclude the work. For example, the Mudanjiang Textile Factory did not formulate a measures plan, but simply copied last year's competition conditions, and wanted to end it perfunctorily. The leading cadres of some factories and mines still have varying degrees of conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles, and do not mobilize the masses to explore the potential strength of enterprises, and do not mobilize the scientific and technical staff to participate in the discussion in order to improve production management. In particular, the discussion of plans and the completion of current production tasks are not closely integrated. Statistics for January showed that only eight of the seventeen factories and mines completed their tasks, and statistics for February showed that only twenty-three of the forty-two factories and mines completed their tasks.
    Also reported: State-owned and local state-owned factories and enterprises in Tianjin City began a mass discussion on revising quotas and formulating the 1953 production plan in mid-February. Now, the mass discussion stage in the heavy industry, machinery industry, and public utility industry systems has basically ended, and they are organizing forces to balance the plan. The textile system and local state-owned factories are continuing to deepen the discussion.
    The units in Tianjin City that have done a better job in this discussion and revision of plans generally have the following characteristics:
    First, combined with the formulation of plans, they mobilized the masses to launch a struggle against falsehood, concealment, arrogance, complacency, and bureaucracy, which powerfully attacked conservative and backward ideas. For example, in the Tianjin Local State-owned First Printing and Dyeing Factory, the production capacity of the mercerizing machine and the opening machine was too small, which affected the overall output of the factory. After the "Three-Anti" campaign last year, workers suggested that the administrative leaders spend several million yuan to purchase several parts to change the mercerizing and drying to double-width production; however, the leaders had not adopted it, and this year they still formulated the plan according to the weak link of the factory—the output of the mercerizing machine. This time, the masses exposed this matter, and the leading cadres examined themselves and found that they did have a bureaucratic work style and complacency, and adopted this suggestion. The output plan of the whole factory can be increased by more than one time at the minimum. In total, the 22 factories under the local state-owned industrial bureau alone exposed more than 3,000 problems such as falsehood, concealment, and bureaucracy, which gave the vast number of cadres and employees a relatively profound education and removed some ideological obstacles for formulating advanced production plans.
    Second, they emphasized doing a good job in the technical organization measures plan, changed the past shortcomings of only abstractly discussing numbers, and ensured the realism of the plan. For example, when the No. 1 Power Plant started to formulate the plan, the coal consumption index set by the ministry was 0.51 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour of electricity. They set it at 0.5 kilograms, which they thought was very advanced. Later, they mobilized the masses to discuss and came up with five measures, such as implementing a unified operation method and solving the steam consumption of the No. 2 machine. Only 0.485 kilograms of coal is needed per kilowatt-hour of electricity, which can save more than 700 million yuan for the whole year. The goal of the bicycle tire group of the State-owned Rubber Accessories Factory this year is to eliminate second-class products. They lacked confidence when they started discussing it. Later, with the help of technicians, they studied the causes of second-class products and the improvement methods, and determined the persons in charge of implementing these methods and the date of implementation, and formulated the group's measures plan. It is expected that the second-class products can be basically eliminated by the end of June this year.
    Third, they grasped the key issues. Last year, when some factories formulated production increase and conservation plans, they only generally mobilized the masses to find solutions and put forward rationalization proposals. As a result, although the masses put forward thousands of solutions, they did not solve the main problems of the whole factory; some solutions were therefore backlogged for a long time. This year, factories generally accepted the experience of solving key problems in the quota determination, and first studied the key problems of the whole factory and each workshop and group in the plan formulation, and mobilized the masses to find solutions and tap potential around these key problems. For example, the Tianjin Water Company researched and determined that the key problems of the unit were: in reducing costs, the main thing was to reduce the consumption of bleaching powder and electricity; in expanding business, it should focus on developing new installation work and expanding public water meter business. The leaders launched technical personnel and workers to study and discuss these key issues, and everyone put forward 163 solutions, which were compiled into 31 technical organization measures, so that the unit cost in 1953 was reduced by 4.6% compared with last year, the sales volume increased by 8.4%, and the profit income increased by 15.3%.

### 松江、哈尔滨、天津等地工厂职工  普遍讨论生产计划挖掘企业生产潜力

    松江、哈尔滨、天津等地工厂职工
    普遍讨论生产计划挖掘企业生产潜力
    松江省和哈尔滨市各国营工厂已全面开始讨论一九五三年生产计划，少数工厂已订出行动计划，正在签订集体合同，开展爱国主义劳动竞赛。
    由于中共松江省委及哈尔滨市委抓紧领导，及时指示、检查，多数工厂讨论生产计划工作都是有准备、有领导地进行的。各厂大体上都已采取或将采取下述步骤和方法：一、深入进行关于一九五三年全国“三大任务”的思想教育，组织干部学习文件，统一思想，找出本单位的关键问题；二、发动职工围绕关键问题找窍门、挖潜力；三、订出个人、小组、车间、全厂的行动计划；四、签订集体合同，发动劳动竞赛。在讨论过程中，中共松江省委及哈尔滨市委及时地召开了工厂党员干部大会和座谈会，批判了各种保守落后思想，介绍了五三工厂讨论计划的经验和哈尔滨铁路工厂制订技术组织措施计划的经验，对工作的开展起了很大的推动作用。
    各厂讨论计划的工作，是在批判了各种保守思想之后开展起来的。例如哈尔滨水泥厂的领导干部开始时认为：“去年没有完成增产节约计划，是因为计划订得太高了；今年可得接受去年的教训，计划不能订高了。”后来他们批判了保守思想，深入发动职工讨论计划，到三月上旬，已出现了五百七十一件窍门，可提前二十天完成全年国家计划。某工厂的领导干部最初认为潜力已经挖光了，厂长曾到局里要求削减生产任务。后来经过调查研究，发现生产中还有很多潜力，便发动职工找窍门，使得大部关键问题得到解决，领导干部对完成国家计划就有了信心。
    各厂在领导讨论生产计划中，一般地都抓住了全厂的以及车间、小组的关键问题。今年各厂出现的窍门件数不如去年多，但解决关键性问题的窍门比重相当大，这是今年讨论生产计划的特点之一。例如哈尔滨铁路工厂到三月上旬共出现窍门九百八十五件，其中解决关键性问题的窍门有一百一十八件。机械十厂第三车间领导上指出了本车间的四大关键，发动职工“抢课题”、找窍门，现已找出六十八件窍门，经过采长补短，综合为十七件，可解决三大关键问题。
    但是，目前讨论计划工作，仍然存在着一些缺点，有些厂矿有形式主义作风，不作准备工作，急于求成，草率收兵。如牡丹江纺织厂没有订出措施计划，只照样抄袭了去年的竞赛条件，就想马虎结束了。有些厂矿的领导干部还有程度不同的保守思想与官僚主义作风，不去发动群众发掘企业中的潜在力量，没有很好地发动科股人员参加讨论以便改进生产管理。特别是讨论计划和完成当前的生产任务没有密切结合，一月份统计了十七个厂矿，只有八个完成了任务，二月份统计了四十二个厂矿，只有二十三个完成了。
    又讯：天津市国营和地方国营工厂企业，从二月中旬开始，展开了群众性的讨论修订定额与制订一九五三年生产计划的工作。现在重工业、机械工业和公用工业系统，群众讨论阶段已基本结束，正组织力量平衡计划。纺织系统和地方国营各厂正继续深入讨论。
    天津市这次讨论修订计划工作作得较好的单位，一般具有如下几个特点：
    第一、结合制订计划，发动群众展开了反对虚假隐瞒、反对骄傲自满和官僚主义的斗争，有力地打击了保守、落后思想。如天津地方国营第一印染厂因为丝光机和开幅机生产能力太小，影响全厂产量不能提高。去年“三反”后，工人曾建议行政领导上用几百万元添购几个零件，将丝光和烘干改为双幅生产；但是领导上一直没有采纳，今年仍旧按照全厂的薄弱环节——丝光机的产量制订计划。这次群众把这件事揭发出来，领导干部检查了自己确实是有官僚主义作风和自满情绪，采纳了这个建议，全厂的产量计划最低可较前提高一倍以上。总计，只地方国营工业局所属二十二个厂，就揭发出虚假隐瞒和官僚主义等问题三千多件，使广大干部和职工受到了一次较为深刻的教育，为制订先进的生产计划扫除了某些思想障碍。
    第二、强调做好技术组织措施计划，改变了过去只是抽象地讨论数字的缺点，保证了计划的现实性。如发电一厂开始订计划时，部定的煤耗指标是每度电用煤零点五一公斤，他们订成零点五公斤，就觉得很先进了，后来发动群众讨论，想出实行统一操作法、解决二号机费汽等五项措施，每度电只需耗煤零点四八五公斤，只此一项全年即可节约七亿余元。国营橡胶配件厂自行车外胎小组今年的计划是消灭二等品。他们开始讨论时，信心不足，以后由技术人员帮助，研究出造成二等品的原因和改进办法，并确定了实现这些办法的负责人和实现的日期，订出了小组的措施计划，预计今年六月底可基本消灭二等品。
    第三、抓住关键问题。去年有些工厂制订增产节约计划时，只是泛泛的发动群众找窍门，提合理化建议。结果群众虽然提出了上千件窍门，但没有解决全厂的主要问题；有的窍门因而被长期积压下来。今年一般工厂接受了查定中解决关键问题的经验，在订计划中首先研究出全厂的和各个车间、小组的关键问题，发动群众围绕这些关键问题找窍门、挖潜力。如天津市自来水公司研究、确定了本单位的关键问题是：在降低成本方面，主要是降低漂粉及电力消耗；在扩展业务方面，应当着重开展新安装工作及扩展公用水表业务。领导上针对这些关键问题发动技术人员和工人研究讨论，大家提出了一百六十三件窍门，汇集成为三十一件技术组织措施，使一九五三年的单位成本较去年降低了百分之四点六，售水量提高百分之八点四，利润收入提高了百分之十五点三。
