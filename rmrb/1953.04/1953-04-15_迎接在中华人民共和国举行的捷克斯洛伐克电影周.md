    Greeting the Czechoslovak Film Week Held in the People's Republic of China
    Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic to the People's Republic of China, Konsala

    The Czechoslovak Film Week held in the People's Republic of China will begin on April 15, 1953. The working people of Czechoslovakia take this opportunity to extend their warmest respects to the Chinese people, hoping that this will further promote the friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia and deepen it even more.

    During the Czechoslovak Film Week, the Chinese people can see various scenes of the life and history of the Czechoslovak people on the screen, which is exactly what the Czechoslovak filmmakers deeply hope for. Of course, Chinese audiences will notice that the Czechoslovak people live in a distant place, but despite being separated by thousands of miles geographically, the Chinese people will still feel very close to them. Chinese audiences will definitely feel that there is a "something" connecting them and the Czechoslovak people, and this "something" helps them understand the lifestyle, immediate problems, and goals of the Czechoslovak people. The Chinese people will see that these problems and goals are the same as their own. Because of this belief, it is possible not only to feel that China and Czechoslovakia are not so far apart, but also to consolidate our feelings—the alliance connecting the people of China and Czechoslovakia is a feeling of greatness and unity.

    On what basis are the common interests and goals of the people of China and Czechoslovakia based? The spirit and content of Czechoslovak films themselves will provide answers to this question.

    These films show, on the one hand, the excellent and revolutionary traditions of the Czechoslovak people in the struggle for national and social freedom, and on the other hand, the conditions and environment under which the Czechoslovak people gained freedom, as well as the various obstacles that our people should overcome in the struggle against their national and class enemies. The films also show the labor enthusiasm and patriotic fervor with which the Czechoslovak people are building their new and happy life, and the great changes brought to people by the new life. The films also tell how the great example of the Soviet people powerfully influences the Czechoslovak people, and how the Soviet people instruct the working class and all progressive people around the world on how to build a free and happy life for each nation, and how to unite all nations in the struggle to defend world peace.

    Czechoslovak films strive to express on the screen the efforts of the Czechoslovak people to build a happy and free life in their own country, as well as Czechoslovakia's support for the great progressive and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, including the great People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries. Therefore, Chinese audiences will definitely be interested in Czechoslovak films and understand them as if they were their own domestic films.

    But this is only one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, the Czechoslovak people also have great interest in watching Chinese films. Therefore, in May of this year, a Chinese Film Week will also be held in Czechoslovakia, at which time the Czechoslovak people will see new films depicting the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for freedom and independence, and Chinese films depicting their great construction power. The Czechoslovak people will also see in the films the great achievements of the Chinese people led by their working class and the Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong. The Czechoslovak people will learn from them how to defeat the common enemy, the world imperialists, and the domestic traitors who are constantly plotting to infringe on the freedom of the Chinese and Czechoslovak people. The emotion of sharing weal and woe has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the Czechoslovak working people, and this emotion will become even closer in the future.

    The spirit of proletarian internationalism in the great theories of Lenin and Stalin is the guideline for the people of our countries to build their new lives. It gives the people of our countries great strength, which overcomes all obstacles that stand in the way of our road to a free and happy future. Therefore, we recognize that film art is not only an effective tool for mutual understanding between our two peoples, but also a lever for promoting the enthusiasm of the people for combat and construction.

    The Czechoslovak Film Week held in the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Film Week held in the Czechoslovak Republic will make our mutual relations closer, enrich the lives of our people with mutual examples, and thereby serve the common cause of peace and cooperation among all nations. Therefore, the Czechoslovak working people admire the Chinese people and are full of determination to deepen Sino-Czechoslovak friendship through labor and struggle. Sino-Czechoslovak friendship, combined with friendship with the great Soviet Union, is a force that no enemy can destroy or break.

    迎接在中华人民共和国举行的捷克斯洛伐克电影周
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻中华人民共和国大使  康萨拉
    在中华人民共和国举行的捷克斯洛伐克电影周将自一九五三年四月十五日开始。捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民藉此机会特向中国人民致以最热烈的敬意，并望由此更能促进中捷两国人民的友谊，使之益加深厚。
    在捷克斯洛伐克电影周中，中国人民可以从银幕上看到捷克斯洛伐克人民的生活和历史的种种场面，这也正是捷克斯洛伐克电影工作者们所深切盼望的。当然，中国观众会注意到捷克斯洛伐克人民是生活在遥远的地方，然而尽管在地理上是远隔万里，中国人民却仍会觉得离他们很近。中国观众一定会感觉到，是有一种“什么东西”在联系着他们和捷克斯洛伐克人民，也就是这种“什么东西”帮助他们能够了解捷克斯洛伐克人民的生活方式，他们的切身问题和目的。中国人民会看到这些问题和目的与中国人民自己的问题和目的是一样的。由于具有这种信念，因而不仅能够觉得中捷两国并不是相隔那么遥远的，而且巩固了我们的感情——相互联系着中捷人民的同盟是伟大与团结一致的感情。
    中捷两国人民的一致利益和目的是奠定在什么基础上的呢？捷克斯洛伐克电影精神的本身和内容对于这一问题是会提供答案的。
    在这些影片中，一方面显示了捷克斯洛伐克人民在争取民族和社会自由斗争中很优秀的和革命的传统，再就是显示了捷克斯洛伐克人民所以获得自由的条件与环境，以及我们人民在和自己的民族与阶级敌人斗争中所应克服的种种障碍。影片也显示了捷克斯洛伐克人民用以建设自己新的幸福生活的劳动热忱与爱国主义热情，以及由于新的生活而给人们带来的伟大转变。影片也叙说了苏联人民的伟大榜样是如何强有力地影响着捷克斯洛伐克人民，苏联人民指示给全世界的工人阶级与一切进步人士，他们应该怎样去建设每个民族的自由幸福生活，以及应该怎样在维护世界和平的斗争中联合所有的民族。
    捷克斯洛伐克影片所尽力以求的，是想在银幕上表达出捷克斯洛伐克人民在自己国内建设幸福自由生活的努力，以及捷克斯洛伐克对于由苏联所领导的包括伟大中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家在内的伟大进步和民主阵营的拥护。所以，中国观众看捷克斯洛伐克电影一定会感兴趣，并且能像自己的国产片那样懂得它。
    但是这还不过是事情的一方面，另一方面，捷克斯洛伐克人民也有很大兴趣看中国电影。所以，在本年五月间，在捷克斯洛伐克也将举行中国电影周，届时，捷克斯洛伐克人民就会看到新的描写中国人民争取自由和独立的英雄斗争的影片，描写其巨大建设力量的中国影片。捷克斯洛伐克人民也会在影片中看到由自己工人阶级和以毛泽东主席为首的共产党所领导的中国人民的伟大成就。捷克斯洛伐克人民将向他们学习，如何去战胜共同的敌人，战胜世界帝国主义者，战胜不断地设下阴谋侵害中捷人民自由的国内叛徒。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的心目中早已深刻地树立了休戚相关的感情，而这种感情，将来会更形密切。
    列宁斯大林的伟大学说中的无产阶级国际主义精神，是我们各国人民建设自己新生活的指针，它给予我们各国人民以伟大的力量，这种力量克服着横在我们走向我们自由和幸福将来的大道上的一切障碍。所以，我们这样认识的电影艺术对于我们两国人民不仅是互相了解的有效工具，而且也是发扬人民的战斗和建设热情的杠杆。
    在中华人民共和国举行的捷克斯洛伐克电影周和在捷克斯洛伐克共和国举行的中国电影周将使我们的相互关系更加亲密，以相互的榜样丰富我们人民的生活，并由此而为各族间和平与合作的共同事业服务。所以捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民敬佩中国人民，并充满了以劳动和斗争来加深中捷友谊的决心。与伟大苏联的友谊结合起来的中捷友谊是任何敌人不能破坏和破坏不了的力量。
