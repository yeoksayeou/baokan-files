Abstracts of Soviet Press Articles

    Building Must Be Fast, Strong, and Economical

    The "Pravda" published an editorial on January 13, discussing the responsibilities of economic leaders and Party organizations in construction projects. The abstract is as follows:

    It is the responsibility of the leaders of various construction organizations and departments to fully utilize existing possibilities and mobilize the richest internal potential to serve the successful completion of industrial and residential construction plans.

    It must be admitted that there are still many significant shortcomings in the work of construction organizations. The speed of industrial and residential construction is often delayed due to serious shortcomings in labor organization. This is particularly evident on the construction sites of the "Krivoy Rog Coalfield Construction Trust." Here, much strenuous work is done by hand, while highly productive machines are often not utilized. This trust has not paid due attention to promoting advanced experience in construction work. Similar shortcomings exist in the work of some other trusts under the Heavy Industry Factory Construction Engineering Department.

    In many construction organizations, the cost of work is very high. This is the result of the incorrect use of labor, waste of materials, and excessive overheads.

    Economic leaders and Party organizations in construction projects should always be concerned with improving the quality of construction work and reducing its cost. Building quickly, economically, and strongly is their task.

    All employees in construction projects, leaders of various construction trusts, general management offices, and departments should insist on improving the utilization of the extremely rich machinery in construction projects, implementing large-scale plans for comprehensive mechanization of work, systematically adopting the latest achievements of science and technology in construction, and constantly and tirelessly perfecting the forms and methods of labor organization.

    The mission of local Party organizations is to delve deeply into the operations of construction projects and strive for the smooth completion of national plans and tasks on every construction site. Their responsibility is to more broadly launch socialist emulation in construction projects, constantly lead the creative initiative of construction personnel, and fight for shortening deadlines, improving construction quality, and reducing construction costs.

    New Literary Year

    The "Literary Gazette" published an editorial on January 6, entitled "New Literary Year," which pointed out the future direction of efforts regarding several issues in the Soviet literary circles in 1952. The abstract is as follows:

    Comrade Stalin teaches us that the basic law of socialism is to care for people. This basic law of our life itself defines the entire development of socialist realism literature, defines the tasks of every writer, and defines the demands made by the people and the Lenin-Stalin Party on literature. For writers, caring for people means: first, it is essential to create convincing and comprehensively expressed images of positive characters, which must be able to be emulated by millions of readers in their lives, work, and struggles.

    Caring for people means requiring writers to carefully cultivate the sprouts of new things and ruthlessly eliminate all the weeds that grow among these new sprouts.

    Literature's care for people is the truth of life reflected by the artist.

    While calling for a profound and comprehensive expression of modern positive characters, the Party's newspapers and periodicals must make writers aware that our literature is far from adequate in its use of satirical weapons, this sharp weapon for fighting against malpractices in social life and the outdated remnants in people's consciousness.

    Sharp, incisive, and accurate satire is one of the most active forms of supporting new things in the constant and solitary battle of new things against the lies of the old and capitalist lifestyles.

    The Party's newspapers and periodicals should be models of actively using this form. Essays that lash out at specific malpractices must appear frequently in newspapers. This is an important material for summarizing and analyzing various phenomena using literary means.

    Being good at seeing and understanding the conflicts of real life, being good at comprehensively expressing things with good beginnings and ruthlessly criticizing everything that hinders progress—all of these are huge and complex tasks. Writers who deeply understand typical problems will play a very important role in the completion of these tasks.

    Being good at distinguishing between the common and the typical, being good at seeing the sprouts of new things and supporting them, ruthlessly eliminating the weeds that often grow alongside them—this is the task of writers.

    The artist can show his political stance and his Party spirit when he understands typical things and expresses his attitude towards this or that typical phenomenon in life.

    Mastering form—this not only means mastering language, mastering the art of correctly portraying characters and clearly depicting images; writers should also strive to organize things correctly and try to fully study the laws of the genre they are writing about.

    Much criticism still fails to see the direct correlation between formal shortcomings and content shortcomings, and analyzes the form of art very superficially. Whether talking about the advantages or the incompleteness of art, it is usually concluded at the end of the article with comments unrelated to the overall analysis: a few empty words about structure, a few empty words about language, two or three examples. This arbitrary comment often only leads the author astray.

    Criticism and literary research have far from completed their most important tasks: these tasks are to study the various issues of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, and the Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theory issues related to specific phenomena in literary life. Our writers have little interest in studying theoretical issues and analyzing artistic techniques. If we look at the legacy of classical writers, we will see how deeply concerned they were with the artistic creation issues of their time. They severely criticized their own works, and they also severely criticized the works of their friends. Unfortunately, this glorious tradition of Russian literature has been forgotten by many of our modern writers. There is no doubt that this has a negative impact on the quality of their works.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    建筑要快、牢固和节省
    真理报一月十三日发表社论，论述在建筑工程中经济领导者和党组织应负的责任。摘要如下：
    各建筑组织和各部的领导者们的责任，是充分利用现有的可能性，把最丰富的内在潜力发动起来，使它们为成功地完成工业的和住宅的建筑计划而服务。
    应当承认，在建筑组织的工作中，仍有不少巨大的疏漏之处。工业工程和住宅的建筑速度常常由于在劳动组织中的严重缺点而延缓。这特别表现在“克里夫煤区建筑托拉斯”的建筑工地上。这里很多费力的工作是用手来进行，而具有高度生产率的机器却常常没有利用。这个托拉斯对于推广建筑工作的先进经验，没有给予应有的注意。在重工业工厂建造工程部所属的其他一些托拉斯的工作中，也有着类似的缺点。
    在很多建筑组织中，工作的费用非常高。这是不正确地使用劳动力、浪费材料和杂费过高的后果。
    建筑工程中的经济领导者和党组织应当经常关怀于提高建筑工作的质量和降低它的费用。建筑得快，节省，而且牢固，这就是他们的任务。
    建筑工程中的全体员工，各个建筑托拉斯，总管理处和各个部的领导人，应当坚持改进对建筑工程中极为丰富的机器的利用，大规模地实行工作全面机械化的计划，有计划地在建筑中采用科学和技术的最新成就，并经常地和不倦地使劳动组织的形式和方法趋于完善。
    地方党组织的使命是深入到建筑工程的业务中去，在每一个建筑工段上，争取顺利完成国家的计划和任务。他们的责任，是在建筑工程中更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，经常领导建筑人员的创造积极性，为争取缩短期限，提高建筑质量和降低建筑费用而斗争。
    新文学年
    文学报”一月六日发表以“新文学年”为题的社论，就一九五二年苏联文学界的几个问题，指出了今后努力的方向。摘要如下：
    斯大林同志教导我们说：社会主义的基本法则，就是关心人。这个关于我们的生活基本法则本身，就规定了社会主义现实主义文学的全部发展，规定了每个作家的任务，规定了人民和列宁—斯大林的党对文学所提出的要求。对作家来说，关心人的意义，就是：首先必须创造使人信服的和全面表现出来的正面人物的形象，这个形象是一定要使千百万读者在生活、劳动和斗争中可以仿效的。
    关心人就是要求文学家细心地培育新事物的萌芽，无情地消灭在这些新萌芽之间生长起来的所有野草。
    文学对人的关心，就是艺术家所反映出来的生活的真实情况。
    与号召深刻和全面地表现现代的正面人物同时，党的报刊要使作家们注意，我们的文学对于讽刺武器，对于这一个与社会生活中的恶习和人们意识中的陈旧残余作斗争的尖锐武器的使用，是十分不够的。
    敏慧的，尖锐的，瞄得准确的讽刺是在新事物经常与陈旧的、资本主义的生活方式的谎言进行单独战斗中，最积极的支持新事物的形式之一。
    党的报刊应当是积极使用这一形式的范例。鞭笞具体的恶劣作风的小品文，一定要经常在报纸上出现。这是用文学手段来总结和分析各种现象的一种重要材料。
    善于看出和理解现实生活的冲突，善于全面地表现有良好开端的事物和无情地斥责一切阻碍前进的落后事物——所有这些都是巨大的、复杂的任务。作家深刻地理解了典型问题，就会在这些任务的完成上，起非常重要的作用。
    善于区别常见的和典型的，善于看出新事物的萌芽而且支持它，无情地消灭时常与它同时并生的野草——这就是文学家的任务。
    艺术家就在理解着典型的事物，表明着自己对生活中这种或那种典型现象的态度的时候，可以表现出自己的政治立场，自己的党性。
    掌握形式——这不仅意味着掌握语言，掌握正确地刻划性格和明朗地描绘形象的艺术；作家还应当努力把事物正确地组织起来，尽力充分地研究他所写的那种体裁的规律。
    很多的批评都还看不明白形式缺点和内容缺点之间直接的相互联系，很肤浅地分析艺术的形式。无论谈到艺术的优点或艺术的不完整性，照例在文章的结尾归结为与总分析无关的评语：几句有关结构的空话，几句有关语言的空话，两三个例子。这种任意的评论，往往只能把作者引入迷途罢了。
    批评和文学研究远远没有完成自己最主要的任务：这些任务就是研究马克思列宁主义美学的各种问题，与文学生活中的具体现象有关的马克思列宁主义的文艺理论问题。我们的作家对于研究理论问题和分析艺术技巧方面，是很少发生兴味的。如果我们看一看古典作家的遗产，我们就会看到他们是如何深切关心于同时代的艺术创作问题。他们严厉地批评自己的作品，也严厉地批评朋友们的作品。可惜，俄国文学的这种光荣传统为我们许多现代的作家所忘掉了。毫无疑问，这对他们的作品质量是有不好的影响的。
