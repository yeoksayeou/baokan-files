The State Administration Council of the Central People's Government's Instruction on Discouraging Farmers from Blindly Flowing into Cities

According to recent reports from various localities, since the beginning of spring, many farmers, wanting to participate in industrial construction, have entered cities to seek work. According to statistics from Shenyang and Anshan in Northeast China alone, there are more than 20,000 people. At present, as urban construction is still in its initial stage and the demand for labor is limited, the result of farmers blindly entering the city is that it increases the unemployed population in the city, causing difficulties in handling the situation; in rural areas, the reduction of labor force greatly affects spring plowing and sowing, causing losses in agricultural production.

In order to prevent the continued development of this chaotic situation, the following instructions are hereby given, and it is hoped that the people's governments of all provinces and cities will urge relevant units to earnestly implement them:

	I. The people's governments of all provinces and cities should immediately notify the county, district, and township governments and farmers' associations to patiently explain to the farmers who are preparing or requesting to enter the city, dissuading them from entering the city, explaining that urban industrial construction is still in its initial stage, and the existing construction workers already exceed the demand. Free entry into the city will make it impossible to find work, not only causing loss of travel expenses, but also delaying rural production. In the future, when urban construction needs to increase workers, the district and township governments will be formally notified to recruit in a planned and organized manner.

	II. From now on, county, district, and township governments shall not issue introduction certificates to farmers who request to enter the city to find work, unless they have official documents from industrial and mining enterprises or construction companies proving that they are reserved workers or contract workers.

	III. Farmers who have already entered the city, except for those needed by construction units, should be mobilized to return to their hometowns by the local people's government's labor departments and civil affairs departments in conjunction with trade unions and other relevant authorities. A cautious attitude should be adopted in the handling process. Those who have real difficulties with return travel expenses may be appropriately subsidized by the civil affairs department to persuade them to return to their hometowns quickly; those who currently have real difficulties in life should be given appropriate relief.

	IV. All farmers who are freely recruited from rural areas by various construction engineering units, or the original reserved workers, who are deemed unnecessary by their units at present, shall be handled by the units responsible for mobilizing them to return to their hometowns and issuing travel expenses.

	V. County, district, and township people's governments that issue introduction letters indiscriminately shall be responsible for mobilizing farmers who are introduced to cities to seek employment but cannot find jobs to return to their hometowns.

	VI. Village cadres and militiamen who freely enter the city to find work shall all return to their hometowns to lead farmers in spring plowing and sowing. Honorary soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers who have already been employed in rural areas and come to the city to find work again should also return to their hometowns and actively participate in production to ensure the completion of the state's agricultural production plan.

	VII. Construction engineering units in all cities should make detailed and accurate plans for engineering design, start dates, the number of people needed, and the number of types of work, and notify the local construction engineering management authorities and labor departments so that labor can be allocated and adjusted in a planned and organized manner. Without the permission or introduction of the labor department, it is not allowed to recruit workers in rural areas without authorization, let alone post notices to recruit workers indiscriminately.

    中央人民政府政务院关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示
    据最近各地报告，入春以来，有许多农民因想参加工业建设，进入城市，寻找工作。仅就东北沈阳、鞍山两市的统计，即有二万余人。目前，由于城市建设尚在开始，劳动力需用有限，农民盲目入城的结果，在城市，使失业人口增加，造成处理上的困难；在农村，则又因劳动力的减少，使春耕播种大受影响，造成农业生产上的损失。
    为了制止这种混乱现象的继续发展，特作如下的指示，望各省、市人民政府督促有关单位切实负责执行：
    一、各省、市人民政府应立即通知各县、区、乡政府、农会向准备或要求进城的农民耐心解释，劝止其进城，说明城市工业建设尚在开始，现有建筑工人已供过于求，自由进城，无法找到工作，不但要遭受路费的损失，而且还要耽误农村的生产；将来城市建设需要增加工人时，将正式通知区、乡政府，有计划、有组织地招收。
    二、今后县、区、乡政府对于要求进城找工作的农民，除有工矿企业或建筑公司正式文件证明其为预约工或合同工者外，均不得开给介绍证件。
    三、现已进城的农民，除为施工单位所需要者外，应由所在地的人民政府劳动部门及民政部门会同工会和其他有关机关动员还乡。在处理过程中应采取慎重态度，对还乡路费确有困难者，可由民政部门适当予以补助，劝其迅速还乡；对目前生活确有困难者，应适当予以救济。
    四、凡系各建筑工程单位自由在农村招来的农民，或原来的预约工，其本单位认为目前不需要时，均一律由各该单位负责处理，动员其还乡，并发给路费。
    五、凡乱写介绍信的县、区、乡人民政府，应负责将其介绍到城市求职而找不到职业的农民动员还乡。
    六、自由进城寻找工作之村干部及民兵，应一律返乡领导农民春耕播种。已在农村安置就业的荣誉军人和退伍转业军人又来城市寻找工作者，也应还乡积极参加生产，以保证国家农业生产计划的完成。
    七、各城市建筑工程单位，应对工程设计、开工日期、用人多少、工种数目详细精确计划，通知当地建筑工程管理机关和劳动部门，以便有计划、有组织地调配和调剂劳动力。未经劳动部门许可或介绍者，不得擅自到乡村招收工人，更不得张贴布告，乱招工人。总理周恩来
    一九五三年四月十七日
