    [This Newspaper's Report] The national steel industry's completion of production plans in March showed progress compared to January and February. However, the situation of balanced production is still not good and urgently needs vigorous improvement.
    According to statistics from the Steel Industry Administration Bureau, in March, apart from steel material actual output completing 95.3%, the rest of coke, iron ore, pig iron, and steel ingots all exceeded the production plans. However, the execution of the plan is still very uneven. Taking the main product pig iron as an example, although the total output of factories and mines nationwide completed the state plan, 60% of the enterprises did not complete their own production plans. From the perspective of equipment, the phenomenon of imbalance is even more widespread. For example, the equipment situation of Yangquan Iron Plant's blast furnaces No. 1 and No. 2 is the same, but the output of furnace No. 1 only reached 58% of that of furnace No. 2. The phenomenon of individual factories and mines rushing to complete tasks at the end of the month is still serious. For example, the pig iron output of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, if the first ten days of March are taken as 100, the middle ten days dropped to 84%, and the last ten days rose to as high as 133%. The reasons for the uneven execution of the plan are mainly that some leading cadres of enterprises do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of balanced production, and secondly, due to frequent accidents and mechanical failures. For example, the steel wire rope of the crane in the steelmaking plant of Factory 101 broke, the steel ladle landed, and the rolls broke twice, resulting in 43 hours of work stoppage. Due to carelessness in operation, red steel bars were rolled into the gearbox of the rolling mill, causing the gears to break.
    The Steel Industry Administration Bureau has repeatedly instructed its affiliated factories and mines to mobilize the masses of workers to discuss production plans, establish and strengthen operational plans, gradually achieve balanced production, and strengthen maintenance work to ensure production safety. However, some enterprises have still not earnestly implemented these instructions, and individual enterprises have not even discussed production plans to this day.

### 全国钢铁工业三月份大部产品完成计划  生产不均衡的状况应当大力改进

    全国钢铁工业三月份大部产品完成计划
    生产不均衡的状况应当大力改进
    【本报讯】全国钢铁工业三月份完成生产计划情况，较一、二月份有进步。但均衡生产情况仍然不好，亟需大力改进。
    据钢铁工业管理局统计，三月份除钢材实产量完成百分之九十五点三外，其余焦炭、铁矿、生铁、钢锭等都超额完成了生产计划。但是计划执行得仍旧很不均衡。如以主要产品生铁为例，全国厂矿的总产量虽完成了国家计划，但却有百分之六十的企业单位没有完成自己的生产计划。从设备上来看，不均衡的现象更为普遍，如阳泉铁厂一、二号高炉设备情况相同，但一号炉的产量仅达二号炉的百分之五十八。个别厂矿月末赶任务的现象仍然严重，太原钢铁厂的生铁产量，如以三月上旬为一百，中旬降为百分之八十四，下旬又高达百分之一百三十三。执行计划不均衡的原因，主要是有些企业的领导干部对于均衡生产的重要性认识不足，其次是由于事故及机械故障不断发生。如一○一厂炼钢厂吊车钢丝绳折断，盛钢桶落地，轧辊折断了二次，停工达四十三小时；由于操作上粗枝大叶，红钢条竟卷入轧钢机变速齿箱内，使齿轮折断。
    钢铁工业管理局曾屡次指示所属厂矿，必须发动职工群众讨论生产计划，建立和加强作业计划，逐步做到均衡生产，并加强检修工作，保证生产安全，但至今仍有部分企业没有认真执行，个别企业到现在还未讨论生产计划。
