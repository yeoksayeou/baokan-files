    Large Numbers of Peasants Blindly Flow into Cities
    People's Governments and Party Committees at All Provincial and County Levels Should Adopt Appropriate Measures to Persuade Them to Stay
    [This Newspaper Reports] Since late February, large numbers of peasants have been blindly flowing into cities in all major administrative regions. As of mid-March, over 20,000 people had flowed into Shenyang and Anshan alone. Xi'an saw as many as 600 peasants entering the city daily. By early April, over 5,000 outside peasants remained in Beijing. In Tianjin, according to statistics for seven days in early March, there were over 1,450 people. By mid-March, the number reaching Taiyuan had reached 10,000. Major cities in East China, Central South, and Southwest China have also experienced similar situations. Some of these peasants come from counties near large cities, while many others come from very distant places. Those arriving in Shenyang and Anshan come from provinces such as Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui; those going to the Northwest also come from areas in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan. Most of these peasants carry letters of introduction and household registration transfer certificates from their original district and township governments, and some Party members and League members even carry letters of introduction for their organizational relationships. However, local governments have not contacted urban industrial and mining enterprise management departments in advance. Currently, construction projects and industrial and mining enterprises in various places need few ordinary workers and cannot accommodate so many people. After entering the city, the peasants cannot find jobs or housing, which not only leaves them destitute but also increases the difficulties of urban work. It is now the spring plowing season, and the large outflow of rural labor is bound to have adverse consequences for agricultural production. According to statistics from 337 villages in Cang County, Hebei Province, 9,100 young and middle-aged people have gone to the cities; in Huanghua County, out of 769 male laborers in seven villages, 552 have gone out this spring. Some rural cadres have also left. As a result, no one is leading the work and production in some villages; some mutual aid teams have also become disorganized or even collapsed. This phenomenon is still developing. Party and government organs in various places should quickly adopt appropriate and effective measures to correct this phenomenon.
    The reasons for the large flow of peasants to the cities, in addition to the actual situation of surplus rural labor, are mainly: 1. Many peasants are not content with agricultural production and want to go to the city to find work, both to participate in industrial construction and to increase their income; 2. Many construction engineering units blindly recruit workers; they do not go through the labor departments for introductions or contact local governments but privately recruit workers from rural areas. Some post public notices to openly recruit, while others use personal connections to attract people arbitrarily, even raising wage standards and promising to pay travel expenses. 3. Some areas are experiencing spring famine, and district and township governments arbitrarily mobilize peasants to go out to seek a living to reduce their own "burden"; in addition, some rural cadres take the opportunity to go out to avoid legal and disciplinary actions or violations of the Marriage Law; some honorably discharged veterans who have returned home are unwilling to work and produce in rural areas and want to work in cities, which is also a reason for the rural population flowing to cities.
    Party and government leading organs in major administrative regions have already paid attention to solving this problem. The Southwest Administrative Committee issued instructions on preventing the blind influx of rural labor into cities, pointing out that peasants introduced to Chongqing by counties, districts, and townships but have not obtained work opportunities and are left destitute should be sent back to their original counties by personnel dispatched by the county people's governments for handling; industrial and mining enterprise construction departments in various cities should strictly implement the unified labor allocation system and are not allowed to arbitrarily recruit and hire. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government has also issued a proclamation requiring people's governments at all levels and district and village cadres to correctly publicize the relationship between agriculture and industry to the peasant masses, explaining that blindly flowing into cities is detrimental to both the country and themselves; strengthen leadership over handicrafts and sideline occupations, and absorb a portion of the surplus rural labor in a planned way; when factories, mines, and basic construction units in various places need workers, they must first apply to the labor departments of the municipal and special district people's governments where they are located, and mobilize in a planned and organized manner after government approval, strictly prohibiting self-recruitment or introduction and recruitment through personal relationships; county, district, and village people's governments must not introduce or mobilize peasants to work in cities without an order from the special district government or above to mobilize workers.

### 各地大批农民盲目流入城市  各省县人民政府和党委应采取妥善办法加以劝阻

    各地大批农民盲目流入城市
    各省县人民政府和党委应采取妥善办法加以劝阻
    【本报讯】二月下旬以来，各大行政区都有农民大批地盲目地向城市流动。到三月中旬为止，流入沈阳、鞍山两市的就有两万多人。西安市每天进城农民曾多到六百多人。到四月初，留在北京市的外来农民已达五千多人。到天津市的，据三月上旬七天统计，有一千四百五十多人。到太原市的，至三月中旬已达万人。华东、中南、西南各大城市也有同样的情况。这些农民有些来自大城市附近各县，也有许多来自很远的地方。到沈阳、鞍山的有山东、河北、河南、江苏、安徽等省的农民；到西北去的也有江苏、山东、河南一带的农民。这些农民多数带有原籍区乡政府的介绍信和户口转移证，其中的党员、团员有的还带着组织关系介绍信。可是，当地政府事先并没有和城市工矿企业管理部门取得联络。目前各地建筑工程、工矿企业需要的普通工很少，无法容纳这么多人。农民进城后找不到职业，也没有住所，不仅自己生活无着，也增加了城市工作的困难。目前正是春耕时期，农村劳动力大量流出，势必对农业生产造成不良的后果。据河北省沧县三百三十七个村统计，到城市的青壮年就有九千一百人；黄骅县的七个村共有男劳动力七百六十九人，今春外出的就有五百五十二人。有些乡村干部也外出了。因此，有些村的工作和生产没人领导；有些互助组也因此涣散，甚至垮台。现在，这种现象还在继续发展着。各地党政机关应当迅速采用妥善的有效的办法纠正这种现象。
    大批农民流向城市的原因，除了农村劳动力原有剩余的实际情况之外，最主要的是：一、不少农民不安心于农业生产，想进城寻找工作，一方面参加工业建设，一方面增加自己的收入；二、不少建筑工程单位盲目地乱拉乱招工人；他们不经劳动部门介绍，不向当地政府接洽，就私自到农村招聘工人。有的张贴布告公开招收，有的通过私人关系任意拉拢，甚至提高工资标准、答应供给路费。三、有些地区发生春荒，区乡政府随便动员农民外出求生，以减轻自己的“负担”；此外，有些乡村干部因为有违法乱纪行为或违犯婚姻法的行为，乘机外出躲避；有些还乡转业的荣誉退伍军人，不愿在农村劳动生产，想到城市工作，也是农村人口流向城市的原因。
    各大行政区党政领导机关已经注意解决这个问题。西南行政委员会发布了关于制止农村劳动力盲目流入城市的指示，指出：已由各县区乡介绍到重庆市但没有得到工作机会而致流离失所的农民，由原地县人民政府派员接回处理；各城市工矿企业建筑部门应严格执行劳动力统一调配制度，不许乱招乱雇。山西省人民政府也发出布告，要求各级人民政府和区村干部向农民群众正确宣传农业和工业的关系，解释盲目流入城市对国家对自己都是不利的；加强对手工业和副业的领导，有计划地吸收一部分农村剩余劳动力；各地厂矿和基本建设单位需要工人时必须先向所在地的市、专区人民政府劳动部门申请登记，经政府批准，进行有计划有组织的动员，严禁自行招雇或经由私人关系介绍引用；各县区村人民政府如无专区以上政府动员工人的命令，一律不得介绍或动员农民到城市做工。
