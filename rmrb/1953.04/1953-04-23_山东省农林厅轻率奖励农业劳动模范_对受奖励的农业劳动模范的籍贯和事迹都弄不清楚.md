Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Rashly Rewards Agricultural Labor Models
　　Unclear About the Agricultural Labor Models' Native Place and Deeds
According to letters from readers in Shandong Province: The Shandong Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry has serious confusion and rashness in rewarding agricultural labor models. The labor models rewarded at the provincial agricultural labor model representative conference convened in January this year, which was mainly the responsibility of the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, were decided by a few responsible cadres of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry based on their personal imagination and wishes. The "Shandong Provincial Agricultural Production Increase Competition Award Committee" was established in August of last year, but the awarding of agricultural labor models this time did not go through this committee. When awarding prizes at the labor model representative conference, Zhong Xingfan, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, repeatedly announced: "A total of forty-two units and individuals in the province have been rewarded." However, when Shandong Dazhong Daily wanted to publish the news, Yang Jie, another Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, said: "A total of fifty-three units and individuals in the province have been rewarded." A reporter from Dazhong Daily checked the list of award-winning labor models and found that there were only fifty-two units and individuals. When asked how this happened, Comrade Yang Jie actually said: "If there is one less, then there is one less." The Department of Agriculture and Forestry has never been clear about how many models were rewarded at this conference and how many prizes were issued. After the rewards were given, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry did not understand the native place and family background of some of the recipients. As for whether the deeds of these labor models are true, the leading cadres of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry are even more clueless. When Dazhong Daily wanted to publish the list of award recipients, they asked the Department of Agriculture and Forestry for an official list, but the Department of Agriculture and Forestry could not provide it. After the comrades of Dazhong Daily sorted out the deeds of the labor models, Comrade Yang Jie said: "Let's not publish it! The materials controlled this time are not sufficient, and the rewards may not be appropriate. If it is published, the labor models will have even more opinions." Many labor models are indeed very dissatisfied with this reward. Some labor models in the Jiaozhou Special Zone said: "This time, the reward for labor models is whoever the higher authorities favor, they reward." Shandong Dazhong Daily has repeatedly raised opinions to the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, but the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has ignored them. The Shandong Provincial People's Government and the Agricultural Committee of the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have not inquired about the problems that occurred in this rewarding of models, but have only asked the Department of Agriculture and Forestry to be fully responsible, and they have only approved it in writing. They should conduct a thorough inspection and correct this extremely unserious practice of rewarding labor models.

    山东省农林厅轻率奖励农业劳动模范
    对受奖励的农业劳动模范的籍贯和事迹都弄不清楚
    据山东省读者来信反映：山东省人民政府农林厅在奖励农业劳动模范中，有严重的混乱、轻率的现象。今年一月间由山东省农林厅主要负责召开的全省农业劳动模范代表会议上奖励的劳动模范，是农林厅少数负责干部凭着个人的想像和愿望来决定的。去年八月间就成立了“山东省农业增产竞赛评奖委员会”，但这一次奖励农业劳动模范却并没有经过这个委员会。在劳动模范代表会议上发奖的时候，省农林厅副厅长仲星帆再三宣布：“全省受到奖励的共有四十二个单位和个人。”可是，当山东大众日报要发表新闻的时候，省农林厅的另一位副厅长杨节却说：“全省受到奖励的共有五十三个单位和个人。”大众日报的记者查了一下受奖劳动模范名单，发现只有五十二个单位和个人。问杨节同志这是怎么回事，杨节同志竟说：“少一个就少一个吧。”究竟这次会议奖励了多少模范、发出了多少奖品，农林厅一直弄不清楚。在奖励了以后，农林厅对有些受奖励者的籍贯、出身成份都不了解。至于这些劳动模范的事迹是不是确实，农林厅的领导干部更是心中无数。当大众日报要发表受奖名单的时候，向农林厅要正式的名单，农林厅拿不出来。大众日报的同志们把劳动模范的事迹整理好以后，杨节同志说：“不发表吧！这次控制的材料不充分，奖励的不一定合适。如果发表了，劳动模范们的意见更多了。”许多劳动模范对这次的奖励确实是很不满意的。胶州专区有的劳动模范就说：“这次奖励劳动模范是上级看中谁，就奖谁。”山东大众日报曾数次向农林厅提出意见，农林厅也没有理睬。山东省人民政府和中共中央山东分局农委对于这次奖励模范中发生的问题，也没有过问，只是叫农林厅完全负责，他们只是书面上批准。他们应当切实进行检查，纠正这种对奖励劳动模范的极不严肃的作法。
