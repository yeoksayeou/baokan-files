Xinhua News Agency: PLA troops stationed in Tibet and experts sent by the Central People's Government's Cultural and Educational Commission are actively participating in the construction of Lhasa.

The PLA soldiers participating in the construction of Lhasa went to the deep mountains and cliffs hundreds of miles away to cut down wood last winter. They dragged the huge timber across the high mountains and transported it along the Lhasa River, which was covered with ice, to the construction area. The soldiers working as stonemasons went to the mountains near Lhasa with their tents as early as last December. In the bitter wind and snow, they had to fight with granite for ten hours every day. Many of them had their clothes worn out, their shoe soles worn through, and their hands were covered with blood blisters, which then turned into hard calluses. However, heroic songs often rang out at many construction sites: "Not afraid of the high snow mountains, not afraid of the cold weather, not afraid of the wind and sand making it difficult to open our eyes. You hammer, I pick, for the construction of the new Tibet, we are not afraid of bleeding and sweating." Tibetan students of the Cadre School of the Tibet Military Region also participated in the construction of the school's buildings while studying.

The site of the livestock serum factory under construction in the suburbs of Lhasa was originally a dam with a radius of more than ten miles. Except for the short weeds on the ground, there was only a lonely empty house in the middle of the dam that no one lived in. Now it has been divided into several rooms. One room is a temporary classroom for the animal epidemic training class. The animal husbandry experts sent by the Cultural and Educational Commission of the Central People's Government teach the Tibetan students who arrived early every day scientific knowledge of animal epidemics. Another room is the office of the personnel sent by the People's Liberation Army to guide the construction. Liu Jianying, who is responsible for guiding the construction, pointed to the dam and told reporters: "Although our work is very hard now, there will be a livestock serum factory here, an animal epidemic school will be established there, a large livestock farm will be established, and a milk farm will be opened." He said: "In the future, this barren dam can provide the Tibetan people with urgently needed things. What we often think of is not the present of this dam, but its future."

    解放军驻藏部队和入藏专家
    积极参加拉萨建设
    据新华社讯：中国人民解放军驻藏部队和中央人民政府文化教育委员会派来的专家积极参加拉萨的建设工作。
    参加建设拉萨市的解放军战士们，在去年寒冬里就到几百里以外的深山悬岩上砍伐木材，他们把庞大的木材曳过重重高山，沿着飘着冰块的拉萨河运到工区。做石工的战士，在去年十二月间就带着帐篷到拉萨附近的山上住下，在凛冽的风雪中，每天要和花岗石搏斗十小时。他们许多人衣服磨破了，鞋底磨透了，手上磨出血泡，血泡又磨成硬茧。但是，在许多工地上常常响起英雄的歌声：“不怕雪山高，不怕天气寒，不怕风沙弥漫难睁眼。你一锤，我一镐，为了建设新西藏，那怕流血和流汗。”西藏军区干部学校的藏族学员们，一面学习，一面也参加该校校舍的建筑工作。
    拉萨郊外正在施工的家畜血清制造厂的地址，原是一个方圆十几里大的埧子，地面上除短短的杂草外，埧子中间只有一座孤零零没人住的空屋。现在它被隔成了好几间，一间是兽疫训练班的临时教室，中央人民政府文化教育委员会派来的畜牧业专家，天天就在这里把科学的兽疫知识教给提前到校的藏族学员。另一间是人民解放军派来指导施工工作人员的办公室。负责指导施工的刘剑英指着埧子告诉记者说：“我们现在工作虽然很艰苦，但是，在这里将有一座家畜血清制造厂，那边要办一个兽疫学校，设立一个大的畜牧场，再开一个牛奶场。”他说：“以后这个荒凉的埧子里，可以供给藏族人民迫切需要的东西。我们常常想到的不是这个埧子的今天，而是它的将来。”
