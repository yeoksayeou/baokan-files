Readers' Letters Summary

    Letters from readers Zhang Mingzhong and Tong Daoxiang: The Agricultural and Forestry Science and Construction Departments of Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, have serious bureaucratic work styles in leading production work. In June of last year, the Agricultural and Forestry Science Department blindly decided to experiment with digging earthen wells in the national wheat high-yield model Zhu Fangren mutual aid group in Da Xing District of the county. All the land in this group is low-lying and sandy. Sandy land is not suitable for digging wells, and low-lying land does not require much irrigation; but in order to have "model laborers take the lead and conduct key experiments," more than 30 migrant workers were mobilized to bring their own rations and work for four days, cutting down more than half a mu of glossy black soybean seedlings, using more than 400 catties of straw and seven wooden stakes, and digging more than two zhang deep, resulting in the well collapsing. In December of last year, the Agricultural and Forestry Science and Construction Departments did not learn from their previous mistakes, nor did they consult with the county magistrate, and decided that the Zhu Fangren mutual aid group would be the target of the second well-digging experiment. The group began digging wells in early March of this year. The township government, fearing that it would not be able to complete the tasks assigned by its superiors, specially moved to the Zhu Fangren mutual aid group to specifically control the well-digging work, and mobilized 58 migrant workers from Shizhuang Village to work for four days, but the well still collapsed as it was dug. The district and township cadres had no choice but to call the Agricultural and Forestry Science and Construction Departments several times to ask for technical guidance. However, Bao Xi Wu, the head of the Construction Department, replied, "We don't have as much experience as you!" The responsible comrade of the Agricultural and Forestry Science Department replied, "You can hire a bricklayer in advance, and you can get reimbursed for paying more." This time, the well of the Zhu Fangren mutual aid group was still not dug, wasting 350 man-days of labor in vain, destroying two mu of land, buying 15 fang (250 pieces per fang) of bricks, and creating a very bad influence among the masses. The peasants said: Even if the well is dug, it can only irrigate a little more than 12 mu of land, which is still not worth the loss.
    Of the eight brick wells that the county decided to experiment with, six have started construction one after another, but they have all lost a lot of manpower and material resources. After the Suqian County People's Government discovered the above situation, it has notified that the other key well-digging experiments should be completely stopped; but no specific handling methods have been proposed yet. We believe that the Agricultural and Forestry Science and Construction Departments of Suqian County have exposed serious errors of subjectivism divorced from reality in arranging well-digging work. They did not conduct investigation and research work beforehand, and repeatedly blindly decided that the Zhu Fangren mutual aid group should take the lead in the experiment. After arranging the work, they did not provide specific assistance to the lower levels, causing undue losses to production. It is especially intolerable that this kind of thing happened after the "Three-Anti" movement. They should immediately examine and correct this erroneous style of work.

### 江苏宿迁县农林科和建设科一再发生盲目布置打井的错误

专栏：读者来信摘要

    江苏宿迁县农林科和建设科一再发生盲目布置打井的错误
    读者张明中、仝道祥来信：江苏省宿迁县农林科和建设科在领导生产工作中有严重的官僚主义作风。去年六月间农林科盲目决定在该县大兴区全国小麦丰产模范朱方仁互助组内试验打土井。该组所有土地都是洼地和沙地。沙地本不宜打井，而洼地又不太需要灌溉；但为了“劳模带头、重点试验”，就动员了三十多个民工自带干粮干了四天，砍掉了半亩多乌油油的黄豆苗，用了四百多斤草和七根木桩，挖了两丈多深，结果井塌了。去年十二月间，农林科和建设科不接受上次教训，也没有和县长研究，又决定朱方仁互助组第二次成为打井试验对象。今年三月上旬该组开始打井，乡政府怕不能完成上级的任务，特搬到朱方仁互助组去专门掌握打井工作，并动员了史庄村五十八个民工干了四天，井还是随挖随塌。区乡干部没办法，几次打电话向农林科和建设科请示，要求技术指导。可是建设科科长鲍希五却回答说：“我们的经验还没有你们多呢！”农林科负责同志答复说：“你们可以事先请好瓦匠，多出点工资可以报销。”这一次，朱方仁互助组的井还是没打成，白白浪费了三百五十个工的人力，毁了两亩地，买了十五方（每方二百五十块）砖，并且在群众中造成了很坏的影响。农民们说：井打成了，也只能灌溉十二亩多地，还是得不偿失。
    该县决定试验打的八眼砖井中，已有六眼先后开工，但都损失了很多人力物力。宿迁县人民政府发觉上述情况后，已通知其他几个打井的重点试验工作全面停止；但还没有具体提出处理办法。我们认为：宿迁县农林科和建设科在布置打井工作上暴露了脱离实际的主观主义的严重错误。他们事前不作调查研究工作，一再盲目地决定朱方仁互助组带头试验，布置工作后对下级又不作具体帮助，使生产受到不应有的损失。这种事情发生在“三反”运动之后，尤其使人不能容忍。他们应该立即检查并纠正这种错误作风。
