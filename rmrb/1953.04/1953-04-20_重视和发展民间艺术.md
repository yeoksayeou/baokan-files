    The First National Folk Music and Dance Performance Conference, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, was held in Beijing from April 1st to 14th. More than 300 outstanding folk artists from various regions and ethnic groups performed more than 100 folk music and dance programs. These enthusiastic and vibrant programs fully demonstrated the richness and excellence of the motherland's folk art, expressed the healthy and simple style unique to folk art, and also demonstrated the exquisite and skilled techniques of the folk artists.

    This conference made us further realize the importance of developing folk art. Folk art, passed down from generation to generation and collectively created, originates from the people's own labor and cultural life, and truly reflects the wisdom, thoughts, and emotions of the working people. Therefore, it can be spread so widely and for so long, and is loved by the vast majority of people, becoming an indispensable part of people's lives. Folk artists and their art were long despised, oppressed, and ravaged by the feudal aristocratic class in the past, but because this art was closely connected with the working people, it has always maintained its strong vitality. After the people were liberated, their own art also gained new opportunities for development. In the future, mass amateur art activities should fully adopt and develop various original folk music and dance forms. In some places, certain district and township cadres have adopted a very wrong attitude towards folk art. They arbitrarily interfere with or even prohibit folk art performances, and even confiscate their musical instruments and props. What is the difference between this behavior and the feudal rulers' attitude towards folk artists? This is also despising one's own national heritage and the people's preferences. The cultural departments of local governments should seriously examine and correct this phenomenon. Local governments should not only refrain from interfering with mass amateur art activities, but should also actively guide and help them. The performance activities of professional and semi-professional folk artists of all kinds should be organized and led so that they can better serve the people.

    This conference has made professional artists further realize the importance of learning from folk art. Professional artists who want to develop their own national music and dance absolutely cannot do without this kind of learning. Only by seriously studying folk art can we truly and thoroughly overcome the erroneous view of despising folk art. We must realize that mass amateur art activities are the foundation of professional art activities. Professional art troupes and artists must seriously collect, sort out, and study folk art in a systematic way, and process and improve it on the original basis; state-owned troupes and song and dance troupes should invite experienced old artists to pass on their skills, and appropriately absorb young and talented folk artists or mass amateur art activists to cultivate them.

    This conference is only the beginning of a large-scale and systematic excavation, research, and study of excellent folk art. National professional artists should continue to deeply explore folk art, strengthen the work of sorting out and researching, so that folk art can be continuously improved through processing, and then promoted among the masses. The artistic creation of New China should seek further development and prosperity on the basis of learning folk art.

    重视和发展民间艺术
    中央人民政府文化部主办的第一届全国民间音乐、舞蹈会演大会，自四月一日至十四日在北京举行。各地区、各民族的优秀的民间艺人共三百余人，表演了一百多个民间音乐、舞蹈节目。这些热情洋溢、活力充沛的节目，充分显示了祖国民间艺术的丰富与优秀，表现了民间艺术所特有的健康、朴素的风格，也表现了民间艺人的技术的精巧与熟练。
    这次会演，使我们进一步认识到发展民间艺术的重要。世代相传，集体创造的民间艺术，是根源于人民自己的劳动和文化生活，真实地反映了劳动人民的智慧、思想和情感，所以能够流传得那么广，那么久，为广大人民所喜爱，成为人民生活中不可缺少的部分。民间艺人和他们的艺术，在过去曾长期地受到封建贵族阶级的轻视、压迫和摧残，但由于这种艺术是和劳动人民血肉相联的，因而始终保持了它的强烈的生命力。人民获得解放之后，人民自己的艺术也就得到了新的发展的机会。今后群众业余艺术活动，应当充分采用和发展民间原有的各种音乐、舞蹈形式。有的地方，某些区乡干部对民间艺术采取了一种非常错误的态度，他们任意干涉甚至禁止民间艺术演出，甚至没收其乐器道具。这种行为与封建统治者对待民间艺人的态度有什么区别呢？这同时也是轻视自己民族的遗产，轻视人民的爱好。各地政府文化主管部门应认真检查并纠正这种现象。群众的业余艺术活动，各地政府不仅不应加以干涉，而且应当积极地加以指导和帮助。对职业的和半职业的各种民间艺人的演出活动，应当加以组织和领导，使他们能更好地为人民服务。
    这次会演，使专业艺术工作者进一步认识到向民间艺术学习的重要。专业艺术工作者要发展自己民族的音乐舞蹈，没有这种学习是绝对不行的。只有认真地学习了民间艺术，才能真正彻底地克服轻视民间艺术的错误观点。我们必须认识，群众业余艺术活动是专业艺术活动的基础。专业的艺术团体和艺术工作者必须认真地对民间艺术进行有系统的搜集、整理和研究的工作，并在原有的基础上加以加工和提高；国营的剧团、歌舞团应请有经验的老艺人来传授他们的技术，并适当地吸收年青的、有天才的民间艺人或群众业余艺术活动分子加以培养。
    这次会演仅是大规模地有系统地发掘、研究、学习民间优秀艺术的一个开始。全国专业艺术工作者应继续深入发掘民间艺术，加强整理和研究工作，使民间艺术经过加工不断提高，再在群众中加以推广。新中国的艺术创造事业应在学习民间艺术的基础上求得更进一步的发展与繁荣。
