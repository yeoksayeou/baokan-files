    American Laboring People Prepare for May Day Demonstrations and Parades
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 4] The United Labor and People's May Day Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 4th to prepare for the demonstrations and parades held by the American laboring people on May 1st. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has sent a telegram to the United Labor and People's May Day Committee, extending warm congratulations from the Chinese workers to the American laboring people, and wishing the April 4th meeting a success.
    In a statement issued by its May Day Temporary Committee, the United Labor and People's May Day Committee said: The United States is currently facing a deep crisis. The Eisenhower government is stepping up its plans to expand aggression, while taking new fascist measures at home. The living standards of American workers are suffering more and more. The statement said: From the hearts of people all over the United States, there is a call for peace and the immediate realization of a ceasefire in Korea. The democratic American people are standing up with greater courage to defend freedom. Organized workers are increasingly demanding unity in political and economic issues. Therefore, this year's May Day demonstration will be a joint demonstration by the American laboring people to strive for peace, freedom, and security.

    美国劳动人民筹备五一节示威游行
    【新华社四日讯】美国劳工与人民纪念五一节联合委员会定于四日举行会议，筹备美国劳动人民在五月一日举行的示威游行。我中华全国总工会已致电美国劳工与人民纪念五一节联合委员会，代表中国工人向美国劳动人民致以热烈祝贺，并预祝四月四日会议的胜利。
    美国劳工与人民纪念五一节联合委员会在它的纪念五一节临时委员会发表的声明中说：美国目前正面临一个深重的危机。艾森豪威尔政府正加紧策划扩大侵略，同时在国内采取了新的法西斯措施。美国工人的生活水平正遭受愈来愈多的打击。声明说：从美国全国各地人民的心里，发出了要求和平和立即实现朝鲜停战的呼声。民主的美国人民正以更大的勇气，挺身保卫自由。有组织的工人日益要求在政治方面的经济问题上的团结。因此，今年五一节的示威，将是美国劳动人民争取和平、自由与安全的联合大示威。
