    Construction preparation work in Jinan and Qingdao is insufficient, leading to idling at construction sites.

    In Jinan and Qingdao, eighty construction projects have commenced, with over ten thousand construction workers entering the sites successively. However, due to insufficient preparation work before construction, serious idling has occurred at many sites. For example, at the Jinan Industrial and Agricultural Accelerated Teachers' School construction site of Shandong Construction Engineering Company, some workers entered the site as early as March 6th, but due to the lack of water, formal construction was delayed until the end of March. According to incomplete statistics from the company, for projects that started in March, workers averaged less than eight working days per person. As a result, the construction plans for the first quarter were almost universally unfulfilled. In Jinan Construction Engineering Company, bricklayers were idle for more than 9,590 workdays in March, and carpenters were idle for more than 2,600 workdays. The idling phenomenon is even more widespread at various construction sites of Qingdao Construction Engineering Company.

    The insufficient preparation work before construction at the aforementioned construction sites is manifested in various ways: some did not prepare or did not prepare well the construction plans before commencement; some had improper labor allocation, resulting in several hundred extra people at the site; some did not adequately prepare materials (because these are generally multi-year projects, some materials were originally stockpiled, but after commencement, materials were not continuously delivered). Judging from the current situation, the risk of continued idling still exists.

    济南和青岛市施工准备工作不够工地上发生窝工现象
    济南、青岛两地已有八十处工程开工，一万多名建筑工人先后进入工地。但由于施工前的准备工作不充分，不少工地发生了严重的窝工现象。如山东建筑工程公司济南工农速成师范学校工地，部分工人在三月六日就进入工地，但因没有水用，拖到三月底还未正式动工。据该公司不完全的统计，三月份开工的工程，工人平均每人干活不足八天。因此，第一季度的施工计划几乎普遍没有完成。济南市建筑工程公司，三月份瓦工窝了九千五百九十多个工作日，木工窝了二千六百多个工作日。青岛市建筑工程公司各工地窝工现象更加普遍。
    上述各工地施工前准备工作做得不够充分，有的表现在开工前施工计划没有做好或做得不好，有的表现在劳动力调配不得当，工地多出好几百人；有的没有充分准备材料（因为一般都是跨年度工程，原来储备了一些材料，但开工后没有继续运送材料）。从目前的情况来看，继续窝工的危险仍然存在。
