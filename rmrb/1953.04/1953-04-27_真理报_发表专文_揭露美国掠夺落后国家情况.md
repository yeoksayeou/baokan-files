Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th: According to TASS, Moscow: *Pravda* published an article by G. Slavyanov on the 20th, entitled "Monopoly Capital Plunders Backward Countries." The article exposed the essence of the so-called "aid" of the United States to backward countries.

The author wrote: American monopoly capitalists are increasingly stepping up their efforts to penetrate the economies of colonies and dependent countries. They can obtain far greater profits from foreign investment than from domestic investment in the United States. Since 1946, American monopoly capitalists have received more than 9 billion US dollars in profits from direct foreign investment. In recent years, they have obtained 950 million US dollars in profits annually from Latin American countries, equivalent to 17.4 percent of their investment in the region. The United Fruit Company obtains a profit of 600 percent in the banana trade.

The giant American General Motors Corporation reported in 1951 that every dollar invested in the United States could earn a profit of 19 cents, while every dollar invested abroad could earn 94 cents; General Motors Corporation invested 69.4 million US dollars abroad and obtained a profit of 55.8 million US dollars.

Slavyanov pointed out that the purpose of loans from American banks such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the US Export-Import Bank is not to "help" economically backward countries. The Export-Import Bank obtained a net profit of 51.8 million US dollars in the last fiscal year.

The author further pointed out: Expanding the investment of American monopoly capitalists in colonies and dependent countries, consolidating American military and strategic interests, and seizing new investment markets and import markets—this is the basic purpose of the so-called "aid."

In fact, most of the strategic raw materials produced in African, Asian, and Latin American colonies and dependent countries are shipped to the United States. For example, the United States obtains 80 percent of Chile's copper, all of the uranium ore and most of the copper and cobalt from the Belgian Congo. In addition, the amount of copper obtained by the United States from Northern Rhodesia, rubber from Liberia, and tin from Indonesia, Nigeria, and Bolivia is also increasing.

American monopoly capitalists also use unfair pricing policies to exploit backward countries. American companies sell goods at high prices as much as possible and buy raw materials from backward countries at low prices. The Brazilian "Liberation News" pointed out that with Americans monopolizing Brazil's foreign trade, Brazil has lost 200 billion Cruzeiros (the Brazilian currency) in the past decade.

Slavyanov finally pointed out that this "aid" from American monopoly capital brings only greater economic and political enslavement to the oppressed people of all countries.

    “真理报”发表专文
    揭露美国掠夺落后国家情况
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报二十日登载了格·斯拉维扬诺夫的一篇文章，题目是“垄断资本掠夺落后国家”。文章揭露了美国对落后国家的所谓“援助”的本质。
    作者写道：美国垄断资本家正愈来愈加紧打入殖民地与附属国的经济。他们在国外投资能得到比在美国国内投资远为巨大的利润。自一九四六年以来，美国垄断资本家从直接对外投资得到了九十多亿美元利润。近年来，他们每年从拉丁美洲国家得到九亿五千万美元利润，相当于他们在当地投资的百分之十七点四。联合果品公司在香蕉贸易上得到百分之六百的利润。
    庞大的美国通用汽车公司一九五一年的报告说，它在美国的每一美元的投资可以赚得一角九分的利润，而在外国每一美元的投资可以赚得九角四分；通用汽车公司在国外投资六千九百四十万美元，就获得了五千五百八十万美元的利润。
    斯拉维扬诺夫指出，国际复兴开发银行及美国进出口银行等美国银行放债的目的不是要“帮助”经济落后的国家。进出口银行在上一个会计年度便获得纯利五千一百八十万美元。
    作者进一步指出：扩大美国垄断资本家在殖民地和附属国的投资、巩固美国军事和战略利益及夺取新的投资市场和入口市场——这就是所谓“援助”的基本目的。
    事实上，非洲、亚洲及拉丁美洲各殖民地及附属国所出产的战略原料大部分是运到美国去的。例如，美国得到百分之八十的智利铜、比属刚果铀矿砂的全部及铜和钴的大部分。此外，美国从北罗得西亚得到的铜、从利比里亚得到的橡胶、从印度尼西亚、尼日利亚和玻利维亚得到的锡等等，数量也是愈来愈多。
    美国垄断资本家们还利用不公平的价格政策来剥削落后国家。美国公司尽可能以高价出售货物、以低价从落后国家购买原料。巴西“解放报”指出，在美国人垄断巴西对外贸易的情况下，巴西在过去十年中损失了二千亿克鲁塞罗（巴西币名）。
    斯拉维扬诺夫最后指出，美国垄断资本的这种“援助”给被压迫的各国人民带来的只是经济与政治上的更大的奴役。
