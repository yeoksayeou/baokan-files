Under the Guidance of Soviet Expert Comrade Bukov
The General Bureau of Irrigation of the Ministry of Water Resources Successfully Experimented and Manufactured Deep Well Water Wheels

The General Bureau of Irrigation of the Ministry of Water Resources, under the guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Bukov, has successfully experimented and manufactured sprocket-type deep well water wheels. This solves the irrigation problem in deep well areas of our country.

Animal-powered water wheels are the main irrigation tools in the vast rural areas of northern China, including various types of pipe water wheels such as Liberation-style, gear-type, small five-wheel, light three-wheel, and old-fashioned bucket water wheels. These water wheels all use gear transmission, resulting in significant friction loss, and are only suitable for shallow wells with a water level within three or four *zhang* (approximately 10-13 meters). If used on deep wells, they require a large traction force, making it difficult for one animal to pull. Furthermore, due to insufficient strength of the machinery, they are prone to failure or damage. After Soviet water conservancy expert Comrade Bukov discovered this situation, he suggested that we manufacture a pipe water wheel directly driven by a chain to reduce mechanical friction loss and improve irrigation efficiency. Under the guidance of Comrade Bukov, the General Bureau of Irrigation of the Ministry of Water Resources began designing in the summer of 1950, and after more than two years of repeated experiments and modifications, finally produced this new type of pipe water wheel suitable for deep wells – the sprocket-type deep well water wheel. One of these water wheels was tested on a well four *zhang* and five *chi* (approximately 15 meters) deep in Xihuang Village in the western suburbs of Beijing. The results showed that it pumped six tons of water per hour, requiring a traction force of less than 30 kilograms, making it very easy for the animal to pull, and achieving a mechanical efficiency of 85%. Another one was tested in the suburbs of Xi'an. At that time, farmers saw this water wheel installed on a well about six *zhang* (approximately 20 meters) deep, and one person could easily push it seven or eight rounds in one breath. They happily said: "Where is this water wheel made? It is so light and convenient, even a small donkey can pull it."

During the more than two years of trial production, Comrade Bukov, although busy with huge water conservancy projects such as the Huai River control and the Jingjiang flood diversion, still often cared about the trial production of this water wheel. Every time a sample was produced for testing, no matter how hot the weather or how far the journey, he always participated in person and provided valuable suggestions for improvement based on the test results. He not only paid attention to important technical issues, but also did not let go of even a very small problem. Once, he saw that the oil groove of the water wheel's horizontal axis did not have a cover, and pointed out: "The water wheel is used in the fields, and dust and dirt can easily get in. The oil groove should be covered." During the trial production process, the former Yanjing University Department of Mechanical Engineering Experimental Factory and the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory made great efforts to reduce the weight of the machine, reduce processes, and reduce costs, making this water wheel more in line with the needs of the masses.

The main structure of the sprocket-type deep well water wheel is: a three-legged frame fixed to a wooden base with screws; above the frame is a horizontal large sprocket wheel, with a drawbar seat in the middle of the large sprocket wheel; on the two legs on both sides of the frame are vertical guide wheels, each with a clip to prevent reverse rotation, and the planes of the two guide wheels form an angle of 112.5 degrees; the circulating chain has a hollow leather purse attached every 2.56 meters (31 rings), and a 4.5 *zhang* deep well uses 14 leather purses; the water scoop is fixed to the base with screws, and the water pipe extends straight from the wellhead to below the water surface, with a flared opening at the end of the water pipe.

The advantages of this water wheel are not only high efficiency, low traction force required, and the ability to draw water from deep wells; but also strong machinery, the large sprocket wheel can be used in both directions, extending the service life of the water wheel by one time; the rotating shafts have good lubrication devices; there are few processed parts, and installation and disassembly are very simple.

This water wheel has now begun to be manufactured, and the first batch of 1,500 units has been assigned to the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Factory. (Gao Rushan) (Attached picture)

    在苏联专家布可夫同志指导下
    水利部灌溉总局试验制造深井水车成功
    中央水利部灌溉总局在苏联专家布可夫同志指导下，试验制造链轮式深井水车成功。这就解决了我国深井地区的灌溉问题。
    畜力水车是我国北方地区广大农村中的主要灌溉工具，有解放式、牙轮式、小五轮、轻三轮等管子水车和老式的斗子水车等多种。这些水车都是用齿轮传动，磨阻损耗很大，并且只适用于水位在三、四丈以内的浅井；如用在深井上，则需要很大的牵引力，一头牲口拉不动；而且由于机件强度不够，容易发生故障或损坏。苏联水利专家布可夫同志发现这种情形后，就建议我们制造一种直接用链子传动的管子水车，以减少机械的磨阻损耗，提高灌水效率。中央人民政府水利部灌溉总局在布可夫同志指导下，由一九五○年夏开始设计，经过两年多的反复试验和修改，终于制出了这种能够适合深井用的新式管子水车——链轮式深井水车。这种水车有一辆曾在北京西郊西黄村一眼四丈五尺的深井上作试验，结果是：每小时出水六吨，牵引力不到三十公斤，牲口拉着十分轻快，机械效率达到百分之八十五。另一辆在西安市郊外作过试验。当时农民看见这种水车安装在六丈左右的深井上，一个人一气就可以推七、八圈，便很高兴的说：这水车是那里做的？真轻便，有个小毛驴就可以拉动。
    在两年多时间的试制过程中，布可夫同志虽然忙于治淮和荆江分洪等巨大水利工程，但依然经常关心着这种水车的试制工作。在每一次制出样品试验时，不管天气多热和路途多远，他总是亲自参加，并且根据试验结果提出了宝贵的改进意见。他不但注意重要的技术问题，就是一个很小的问题也不放松。有一次他看见水车横轴的油槽没有做盖子，就指出：“水车是在田野里使用的，灰土很容易跑进去，应该在油槽上加盖子。”在试制过程中，承制样品的前燕京大学机械系实验工厂和华北农业机械总厂在减轻机体重量，减少工序，降低成本上都曾作了很大的努力，使这种水车更能符合群众的要求。
    链轮式深井水车的主要结构是：一个三条腿的机架用螺丝固定在木制底座上；机架上面是一个水平大链轮，大链轮中间装有拉杆座；机架两旁的两条腿上装有垂直面导轮各一个，各有卡子防止倒转，两个导轮的平面成一百一十二度半的夹角；循环链每隔二点五六公尺（三十一个环）附有空心式皮钱一枚，四丈五尺深的水井用十四枚皮钱；水簸箕用螺丝固定在底座上，水管自井口向下直伸到水面以下，水管末端装有喇叭口。
    这种水车的优点不仅是效率高，所需牵引力小，能从深井中汲水；而且机件坚固，大链轮正反可用，使水车使用年限延长一倍；转动轴都有良好的润滑装置；加工机件很少，安装拆卸都很简便。
    这种水车现在已开始制造，第一批一千五百辆的制造任务已分配给西北农业机械厂。（高如山）（附图片）
