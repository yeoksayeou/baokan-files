    The Hanaoka Massacre was a bloody incident in which Japanese militarists, during the war, massively and cruelly murdered captured Chinese soldiers and conscripted Chinese laborers at the Hanaoka Mine in Akita Prefecture, Japan.
    From July 1944 to June 1945, the Japanese government, through the puppet "North China Labor Association," transported over 900 captured Chinese soldiers and conscripted Chinese laborers to the Hanaoka Mine in Japan in three batches to perform hard labor. Many of them had already died from abuse during transportation. After arriving at the Hanaoka Mine, they were forced to perform extremely arduous manual labor, often in a state of near starvation. As a result, several people died each month under various forms of torture.
    On June 30, 1945, these captured Chinese soldiers and laborers, who were living lives worse than animals, could no longer endure it and angrily killed four Japanese who abused them and one traitor, and collectively fled into the nearby mountains and forests. The next day, the Akita Prefecture authorities immediately mobilized all of the Japanese military police, police, and fire brigades in the prefecture to conduct a large-scale search and arrest, and as a result, all of the escapees were recaptured. Subsequently, the Japanese military police carried out appalling acts of massacre against these Chinese soldiers and laborers. The Japanese military police did not give the arrested people food for four consecutive days, giving each person only a bowl of water a day in the sweltering summer, and constantly and barbarically beat them. According to current investigations, at least 561 Chinese soldiers and laborers were killed in this beastly massacre, including those in Hanaoka and other areas.
    After Japan's surrender, the Yokohama Military Tribunal of the US occupation forces in Japan delayed until March 1, 1948, to sentence a small number of minor offenders involved in the Hanaoka Massacre, but none of the major offenders responsible for the massacre were sentenced. The US occupation authorities, the Japanese government, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's delegation in Japan colluded with each other to cover up the truth of the massacre. It was not until 1950, under the thorough investigation and pursuit of the Chinese Overseas Chinese Democratic Promotion Association in Japan, that the truth of the massacre was finally revealed to the world. Moreover, the incidents of Japanese militarists mistreating Chinese soldiers and civilians in Japan during the war are countless. According to the "Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association Bulletin," in addition to the Hanaoka Massacre, there are more than ten other confirmed massacre incidents, such as the Kiso Valley Massacre, the Nanao Massacre, and the Kosaka Massacre. As for the massacres that have not yet been exposed due to the cover-up by the US and Japanese reactionaries, there are even more of them.
    After learning the truth about the Hanaoka Massacre, Japanese democratic organizations such as the Japan-China Friendship Association and Japanese peace-loving people immediately worked sincerely with overseas Chinese groups in Japan to collect information about the massacre and the remains of the martyred Chinese heroes. Recently, Japanese peace-loving people have decided to assist in transporting the remains of the Chinese martyrs back to China. Peace-loving Japanese people have increasingly firmly stated that they will absolutely not allow the revival of the militaristic era in Japan, and they will promote friendship and unity with the Chinese people, thereby consolidating lasting peace in the East.

    花冈惨案
    花冈惨案是日本军国主义者战时在日本秋田县花冈矿山大批虐杀被俘的中国士兵和被强征的中国工人的血腥事件。
    在一九四四年七月到一九四五年六月期间，日本政府曾利用伪“华北劳工协会”先后分三批把被俘的中国士兵和被强征的中国工人共九百多人从中国押送到日本花冈矿山做苦工。在被押送的途中，他们已有许多人被虐待死亡。到了花冈矿山之后，他们又经常在半饥饿的状态下被迫做极残酷的重力劳动。因此，每月都有好几个人在百般折磨之下死亡。
    一九四五年六月三十日，这些过着牛马不如的生活的被俘的中国士兵和工人，实在忍无可忍，愤而把四个虐待他们的日本人和一个汉奸杀死，并且集体逃到附近的山林。第二天，秋田县当局立即动员全县的日本宪兵、警察和警防团，大事搜捕，结果逃避者全体再度被捕。接着，日本军警对这些中国士兵和工人施行了骇人听闻的虐杀暴行。日本军警对被捕者连续四天不给食物，在酷热的夏天每人一天只给一碗水，并且不断地野蛮地殴打他们。据现已查明的，在这种野兽般的虐杀之下，被杀害的中国士兵和工人包括花冈和其他地区至少有五百六十一人。
    日本投降后，美国驻日占领军总部的横滨军事法庭拖延到一九四八年三月一日才判处了少数有关花冈惨案的次要人犯，而对惨案应负主要责任的人犯却一个也未判刑。美国占领军当局、日本政府和蒋匪帮驻日代表团并且相互勾结，掩盖惨案的真相。直到一九五○年，在旅日华侨民主促进会的彻底调查和追究之下，惨案的真相终于大白于天下。不仅如此，日本军国主义者战时在日本虐待中国军民的事件是数不胜数的。据“东京华侨总会会报”揭露，现在已判明的虐杀事件，除了花冈惨案以外，还有木曾谷惨案、七尾惨案、小坂惨案等十多件。至于由于美、日反动派的掩盖而一时尚未暴露的惨案，更是不在少数。
    日中友好协会等日本民主团体和日本和平人民在闻悉花冈惨案的真相之后，立即热诚地和旅日华侨团体共同努力进行搜集有关惨案的资料和殉难的中国烈士的遗骨的工作。最近日本和平人民已决定协助将中国殉难者的遗骨运回中国。爱好和平的日本人民已经愈来愈坚决地表示，他们绝对不容许日本军国主义黩武时代的复活，他们要促进和中国人民的友谊和团结，进而巩固东方的持久和平。
