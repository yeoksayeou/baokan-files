Editor's Note: The serious incident in Liquan County, Fourth District, Fourth Township, Shaanxi Province, where bad element Yang Maolin usurped township power, embezzled and perverted the law, protected landlords, and carried out long-term terrorist rule over peasants, fully illustrates the main reason why these incorrigible bad elements were able to entrench themselves in grassroots organizations for a long time. It was the serious indifference of certain district and county-level leading organs and leading cadres towards the people's struggle to eliminate evil, which condoned the misdeeds of bad elements. The leading organs of Shaanxi Province and the local county need to treat this incident as a typical case and deal with it accordingly.

Yang Maolin, the original township head of Fourth Township, Fourth District, Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, and a bad element, served as a deputy company commander in the Kuomintang bandit army for many years. At that time, he colluded with landlords and puppet Baojia personnel to oppress peasants. After liberation, he pretended to be progressive, fabricated history, deceived the People's Government, became the township head, and infiltrated the Communist Party. In the winter of 1950, when the land reform in the township had just begun, Yang Maolin accepted bribes from landlords and tried his best to restrict the speeches of peasant activists, slandering them as "not understanding policies and disrupting the meeting," and openly scolding poor and lower-middle peasants as "stupid pigs and muffled dogs," "riffraff," and "thieves." He said to the middle peasants: "You are middle peasants, why are you running around with those people? Even if you struggle against the landlords, you won't get anything." He instructed the landlords' pawns to over-report the labor force and population for the landlords at the evaluation meetings, conceal land and debt relationships, and protect the landlords from slipping through the net; then he made false reports to the district to deceive the higher authorities. At that time, Gao Shangwen, a landlord's pawn who had usurped the position of director of the Peasant Association, also accepted bribes from the landlords and joined Yang Maolin in suppressing the peasant struggle. Therefore, peasant activists first asked the district and county to remove Gao Shangwen from his position as director of the Peasant Association. In order to deal with the higher authorities and the masses, Yang Maolin asked Gao Shangwen's son, Gao Zhijun, to take over as director of the Peasant Association. At the same time, Yang Maolin thought that in order to maintain his rule, he had to alienate the relationship between the masses and the higher authorities. To achieve this goal, he carried out a series of conspiracies. First, he intentionally adopted coercive measures in the work of collecting public grain, making the people complain about the government. When the masses could not hand in the grain on time, he sent militiamen to search for grain everywhere, forcing the peasants to sell their cattle to hand in the grain with tears in their eyes. When a widow in Duanjia Cliff could not hand in the grain on time, they dragged away the child and kicked the old woman to the ground. Yang Maolin declared: "This is the order from above!" "Public affairs are handled impartially!" Then he reported to the higher authorities: "The public grain has been completely completed!" The district blindly regarded Yang Maolin as a "good township head" and praised him at cadre meetings and mass meetings. Then, Yang Maolin colluded with Zhang Zhiqian, the public security assistant员 of the district (former puppet personnel), calling each other brothers, and asked Zhang to use his power to frame good people, and falsely accuse those who opposed Yang Maolin's crimes as "挑是生非挑是生非挑是生非" ("picking quarrels and provoking trouble"), "attacking the township head" as "bad elements." At the same time, Yang Maolin's cronies were installed as "director of the Peasant Association," "director of public security," etc., and village cadres who had close ties with the masses and resolutely fought against the landlords were attacked and replaced.

After carrying out the above-mentioned conspiracies, Yang Maolin more frantically undermined the peasant movement. He held mass meetings in various villages and announced: "The higher authorities have ordered that no one is allowed to sue the landlords." He threatened the peasants, saying: "Whoever sues the landlords again is a counter-revolutionary disrupting the rural regime." And he wanted "village cadres and militiamen to monitor me well, and whoever engages in suing the landlords again, send them to the township government." The landlords and their pawns were arrogant and made secret inquiries. If they found three or two people talking together, they would secretly report to Yang Maolin and attack them. Gao Shulin brothers, landlords in Xiaonumao Village, discovered that peasants Gao Jia, Gao Zhiming, Zhang Ziming and others in their village wrote materials to report their true identities to the higher authorities, so they went to Yang Maolin's place to inform at night. The next morning, Yang Maolin went to Xiaonumao Village to hold a mass meeting, at which he scolded Gao Zhiming and the other two, as well as Wang Zhijian, who helped them write the materials, for two hours, and also beat Zhang Ziming. Gao Zhiming and Gao Jia went to Yaodu Village together and were seen by elementary school teachers Li Jingming and Ma Mingyu (both puppet personnel, who infiltrated the party after liberation), who reported to the township government. Yang Maolin and branch secretary Yan Wenzhang, district cadre Zhang Jianguo and others rushed to the village and took Gao Zhiming and Gao Jia to the township government for interrogation. Yang Maolin said: "Aren't you suing the landlords? This is the court!" In December 1950, Yang Maolin and district public security assistant Zhang Zhiqian bailed out the landlord and Yiguan Dao leader Gao Shujie from the county public security bureau (Yang accepted a bribe of 400,000 yuan). When Gao Yanxiu, a peasant in Xiaonumao Village, discovered this, Yang Maolin threatened Gao Yanxiu with a gun: "Don't tell anyone!" Gao Yanxiu ignored the threat and went to Liquan County People's Government to file a complaint. Men Zhenbang, a staff member of the first section of the county government, called the fourth district government to investigate the matter, and the district asked Yang Maolin's accomplice Zhang Zhiqian to investigate. Therefore, Zhang Zhiqian and Yang Maolin planned to frame Gao Yanxiu. They arrested Gao Yanxiu and took him to the district on the charge of "slandering the township head." Duan Fuxing, the district head of the fourth district at that time, beat Gao Yanxiu and finally sent him to the county people's court for legal action. The county people's court did not interrogate him, but detained Gao Yanxiu for more than seventy days. Later, the county court knew that it had made a mistake, but only released Gao Yanxiu on the grounds that he "performed well during his labor service." In March 1951, Wang Huaiqing, the leader of the peasant association group in Yaodu Village, went to the county people's court to accuse Yang Maolin of privately withholding military shoes and the people's wheat. The county people's court again transferred the matter to the district for investigation. District cadre Zhang Jianguo and Yang Maolin again sentenced Wang Huaiqing to "three months of labor service" on the charge of "slandering the township head." This treatment was also approved by District Head Duan Fuxing. The protection and connivance of district and county cadres further fueled the arrogance of Yang Maolin and other bad elements. Yang Maolin often arbitrarily ordered the peasants who were dissatisfied with him to be tied up and beaten, or personally beat people with shoe soles, benches, wire ropes, gun cleaning rods, whips, etc. The masses were often beaten until their heads were bleeding, their bodies were covered with wounds, and they were even bedridden. Yang Maolin himself beat twenty-two people. After the beating, the beaten people had to set up a banquet to apologize or kneel down to admit their guilt before he would let them go. Once, a staff member went to Yang Xian's home, a poor peasant in Xiaonuyangjia Village, to investigate the situation in the township, and Yang Maolin scolded Yang Xian at a mass meeting: "Open your ancestors' document box and check whether your ancestors have ever sued anyone? How dare you sue someone?" By this, he extorted three dou of wheat from Yang Xian, forcing Yang Xian to sell his seven-month-old boy.

Yang Maolin's dark rule finally failed to conquer the peasants. After each just struggle was hit by bad elements and bureaucratic elements, the peasants secretly held meetings to comfort each other and boost their morale. They said: "As long as Chairman Mao and the Communist Party stand up for us, Yang Maolin can't stop us no matter how powerful he is." These secret meetings of the peasants were held in the wild or in dilapidated temples under the guise of collecting firewood and picking up dung. They constantly elected representatives to report to the higher authorities. The mass representatives of various villages also used the guise of going to the market to conduct contact, and publicly elected the old peasant Li Fengji, who was over sixty years old, as the general representative of the whole township to report to the province.

On September 30, 1951, Li Fengji wrote a letter accusing Yang Maolin and registered it to the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, but the Shaanxi Provincial People's Supervision Committee simply forwarded the letter. Li Fengji waited for more than twenty days without receiving a reply, so he went to the Liquan County Committee to complain. The county committee's receiver did not allow him to enter, saying: "Go to the People's Government to complain!" Li Fengji stuffed the petition into the window of the reception room, but did not receive any response. In December, Li Fengji personally handed a complaint to Qiao Runhe, the leader of the field survey and production group in the township. In mid-December, the complaint was transferred to the district. District cadres identified Yang Maolin as a "good township head" and the complainant as a "bad element," and asked Yang Maolin to "educate the masses." At this time, Lei Zhaochun, the head of the organization department of the county party committee (now the deputy secretary of the Liquan County Party Committee), was working in the fourth district. Without investigation or research, he lightly believed the words of the district and township cadres and agreed to do so. With the support of the bureaucratic elements of the county and district, Yang Maolin held a mass meeting on December 25 to struggle against Li Fengji. At the meeting, Qiao Runhe, the leader of the working group, also threatened Li Fengji to confess his mistakes of "slandering the township head and disrupting the township regime" by saying "If you don't confess, you will be frozen for one night." Li Fengji did not yield, but publicly exposed Yang Maolin's various crimes. Yang Maolin and others became angry and sent Li Fengji to the district for "legal action." District cadre Lu Hongchang obtained the consent of District Head Ma Chao and Deputy Secretary of the District Party Committee Gou Jinghua, forcing Li Fengji to write a "letter of repentance," admit his "mistakes," and ask him to apologize to Yang Maolin. In addition, he was sentenced to "rural control." After Li Fengji returned home, he neither admitted his mistake nor went to apologize, and went to the Liquan County Committee to complain again. From December 28, 1951 to January 1952, he went to the county committee four times: twice he was stopped by guards and failed to enter; once he was received by Cao Zhenqing, a researcher of the county committee, who promised to inform the responsible comrades for research and treatment. The last time, he first saw Zhang Siwen, the acting secretary of the county party committee. Zhang had heard district cadres reflect that Li Fengji was a "bad person" in the past, and sarcastically said: "You are Li Fengji, who has been engaged in litigation for a long time!" and walked away. Li Fengji went to see Lei Zhaochun again, but Lei Zhaochun did not listen to Li Fengji's words at all. Li Fengji said that Yang Maolin harbored landlords, embezzled and accepted bribes, and beat and scolded the masses; Lei Zhaochun said: "The composition of the landlords is determined by the county, and Yang Maolin cannot harbor them even if he wants to." "Did you see Yang Maolin accept bribes from the landlords with your own eyes?" "It is wrong for Yang Maolin to beat and scold the masses, but he has already reviewed it." When Li Fengji insisted on punishing Yang Maolin, Lei Zhaochun said: "It is the government's business to punish Yang Maolin. If you want to sue, go to the court." Before Li Fengji left, he asked what to do with the matter? Lei Zhaochun said: "The materials have been transferred to the district for you, and it will be done as it should be." As soon as Li Fengji returned home, district cadre Lu Hongchang and Yang Maolin wanted to tie up Li Fengji and send him to the district on the charge of "writing a letter of repentance and suing people again." This angered the masses. Dozens of people swarmed up to stop them from tying up Li Fengji and wanted to send Lu and Yang to the county. Under the righteous indignation of the masses, Lu Hongchang and Yang Maolin did not dare to tie up Li Fengji at that time. The next day, Lu Hongchang sent someone to take Li Fengji to the district, scolding and threatening him at the same time: "Even if you sue to the central government, you have to go through here." Gou Jinghua, deputy secretary of the district party committee, sarcastically said to Li Fengji while eating: "You are a worker and a member of the family, so you should have food to eat, but you have violated the people's law and cannot eat it."

After the launch of the Three-Anti Movement, Zhang Weiying (now the deputy director of the Liquan County Public Security Bureau and a member of the County Party Committee) of the Xianyang Prefecture (Note: Now abolished) Public Security Department was sent to Liquan County to help with the work. When Zhang Weiying was looking at the materials, he found a letter from the masses exposing Yang Maolin and others colluding with landlords and framing the informer Gao Yanxiu, and immediately sent Liu Zhijun and Xie Dengke to the township to investigate. As soon as Liu and Xie arrived in the township, they were immediately monitored by the bad element Gao Zhijun. When they went to Gao Yanxiu's home to investigate, Yang Maolin wanted to tie up Liu and Xie on the grounds that "they did not bring a letter of introduction and privately entered the house of a bad person." Liu and Xie were forced to return to the county. Gao Zhijun, Yang Maolin and others illegally arrested Gao Yanxiu to the district prison that night. When Gou Jinghua, deputy secretary of the district party committee, saw Gao Yanxiu, he said: "You said that the cadres are dark, and I will darken you today." The next day, Gao Yanxiu's father cried to the county, and Zhang Weiying told Wang Ying, the former county head, about the matter. Wang did not believe it and said, "How dare they do this!" Only after calling to verify, he believed it. Although Wang Ying criticized Gou Jinghua's approach as wrong on the phone and sent cadres down to investigate, in the end, he just called Yang Maolin to the county, and the cadres of the County People's Supervision Committee lightly criticized Yang and that was the end of it. Yang returned to the township triumphantly and said: "The county didn't do anything to me. The county said I didn't make any mistakes." Zhang Weiying insisted on clarifying the matter, so he sent Liu Zhiqian, a cadre of the County Public Security Bureau, to the township to investigate. After Liu went, he went deep into the masses, conducted individual interviews and secret investigations, and accepted more than forty complaints from the masses, basically clarifying the crimes of Yang Maolin and others controlling the township government, harboring landlords, and persecuting the masses. He clearly pointed out in the investigation report: "The essence of Yang Maolin's problem is class struggle." Zhang Weiying also concentrated the dozens of complaints from the masses against Yang Maolin scattered in various county-level agencies, together with Liu Zhiqian's investigation report, and sent them to the relevant units in the county, asking them to study and deal with them. Lei Zhaochun (who had been promoted to acting secretary of the county party committee at that time) only glanced at the report roughly, and still affirmed that Yang Maolin's problem was a "style" problem, and groundlessly said that Liu Zhiqian's investigation materials were "exaggerated." Later, he used the excuse that the "Three-Anti" movement was busy and put the matter aside. At this time, Yang Maolin reported to the district that "Liu Zhiqian went to the township on the path of bad people" and "caused many difficulties to the township's work." He ran to the district to ask Gou Jinghua, deputy secretary of the district party committee, and Ma Chao, head of the district, to "resign." Ma Chao said: "The district will support you." Gou Jinghua said: "The organization will be responsible for you." With the support, Yang Maolin ran back to the township and scolded the people who reflected the materials to Liu Zhiqian, saying: "See what you dogs can do to me?" Later, the masses continued to expose Yang Maolin's crimes to the county, and the county sent Liu Yimin, a cadre of the Supervision Committee, to investigate again, and transferred Yang Maolin to the county for review again. However, the county head and the secretary of the county party committee still did not personally ask about it, and based on the results of Liu Yimin's conversation with Yang Maolin, they believed that Yang Maolin was "active in his work, but his style was not good." In order to quell the anger of the masses, they decided to transfer Yang Maolin and Liu Qinggui, the township head of the Third Township, to each other. Yang Maolin received the news, on the one hand, he delayed the handover procedures and did not leave the Fourth Township; on the other hand, he sent letters to various county-level agencies and the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Xianyang Prefecture through his cronies, saying: "Yang Maolin is active in his work, his position is very stable, he grasps policies flexibly, and he can seek benefits for the poor," "His only shortcoming is that he is too strict with bad elements," "requiring the government to severely crack down on the bad elements who falsely accuse Yang Maolin." When the masses saw that Yang Maolin was still not leaving the Fourth Township, they sent representatives to the County People's Government to urge him and asked Liu Biaobin, the head of the Civil Affairs Section: If Yang Maolin does not leave, the masses will move away. At this time, Liu Biaobin called and ordered Yang Maolin to leave the Fourth Township on the same day. However, Gou Jinghua and Ma Chao reported to the county: "The county's handling of Yang Maolin's problem is biased, the cadres and the masses are not satisfied, and the work in the Fourth Township has been lagging behind as a result." In fact, Yang Maolin's pawns deliberately resisted paying agricultural taxes and other tasks, trying to force the higher authorities to transfer Yang Maolin back. After Yang Maolin was transferred to the Third Township, he still ruled the Fourth Township with the support of his loyal pawns, and returned to the Fourth Township to beat the peasant Yang Yongxin. However, the county leaders were still not aware of it and did not take any action against the bad elements.

Until August 1952, when the inspection team of the Xianyang Prefecture People's Supervision Office went to the Fourth Township to investigate the Yang Maolin case, the whole township was still shrouded in an atmosphere of terror. After dispelling the concerns of the masses and repeatedly verifying the evidence, the crimes of Yang Maolin were generally investigated clearly, and Yang Maolin was also forced to admit his mistakes in front of the masses, and the enlarged meeting of the Liquan County People's Government also resolved to dismiss and punish Yang Maolin. During his detention, Yang Maolin asked Lei Zhaochun why he was detained. Lei told him that the reason was "incorrigible after repeated education, and still beating people after the Three-Anti." After Yang Maolin clarified this "inside story," he first asked the county court for "leave." Zhao Xian, a judge of the county court, released Yang Maolin without the approval of the leading cadres. After Yang Maolin returned, he summoned his cronies Li Jingming, Yang Yongzhi and others through Li Zhizheng, the acting branch secretary of the township, to hold a "branch meeting," and wrote a letter in the name of this "branch" to prove that Yang Maolin did not beat Yang Yongxin, and sent "branch representatives" to the county committee, the county government, and the county court to testify. At the same time, Yang Maolin's cronies in various villages in the Fourth Township spread rumors to threaten the peasants: "County Head Liu said that Yang Maolin is still going to be the township head of the Fourth Township..." In the letter of certification written to the county government, Yang Maolin and others even signed the name of Yang Yongxin, who was suing the court for being beaten by Yang. Although County Head Liu Xinhuai suspected after seeing it, he did not investigate. Lei Zhaochun called the county court and told them not to detain Yang Maolin for the time being on the grounds that Yang Maolin did not admit to beating people. Yang Maolin divided Yang Yongxiang's homestead, a poor peasant, to his cronie Yang Yanming, and insulted Yang Yongxiang; Yang Yongxiang went to the district to complain, but the district cadres Liu Fang, Liu Ziqian and others did not care, which made Yang Yongxiang commit suicide in extreme anger. Yang Yongxiang's death aroused public anger again, and the family of the deceased went to the county court to complain many times. In order to deal with this matter, Yang Maolin instructed his cronies Li Jingming and others to fabricate rumors, saying that "Yang Yongxiang committed suicide out of shame for raping his daughter-in-law without success." When Ji Fengjie, the clerk of the county court, went to investigate, he listened to the rumors of Li Jingming and others and did not deal with it. It was not until the family of Yang Yongxiang complained to the Shaanxi Provincial People's Supervision Committee and the Xianyang Prefecture People's Supervision Office called Liu Xinhuai, the head of Liquan County, criticizing him for not implementing the resolution of the meeting and not seriously dealing with the Yang Maolin issue, that the county court detained Yang Maolin. Then, Guo Yunshan of the Xianyang Prefecture People's Supervision Office, together with Xu Jingyao of the Liquan County Supervision Committee, went deep into the masses again to investigate and found out the truth about Yang Yongxiang's suicide. In December, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC obtained materials on Yang Maolin's violation of laws and discipline and the serious bureaucracy of the leading cadres of Liquan County from the Xian mass newspaper, and organized a working group with the Northwest People's Supervision Committee and other units to conduct an inspection in the county. When the working group first went to the Fourth Township to investigate, the basic peasants stayed away from the working group. They said: "We have investigated eight or nine times, but it is useless every time. Be careful, if you say too much, you will get into big trouble." Later, after the working group repeatedly explained the policies, exposed the rumors and threats of the Yang Maolin group of bad elements, and vigorously won over the party members and cadres who had made mistakes, the above situation was thoroughly clarified. We are now starting to rectify the CPC branch and rural regime in the area, and are studying to impose sanctions on cadres who have violated the law and dereliction of duty.

    坏分子杨茂林为什么能够长期盘据乡政权实行恐怖统治
    编者按：陕西省醴泉县四区四乡坏分子杨茂林篡夺乡政权，贪赃枉法，保护地主，对农民实行长期恐怖统治的严重事件，其全部详情，深刻地说明了这些怙恶不悛的坏分子所以能够长期盘据基层组织的主要原因，乃是某些区、县以上领导机关和领导干部对于人民群众的除恶斗争抱着严重的漠视态度，纵容了坏分子的作恶。陕西省和当地县的领导机关，有必要把这一事件当作典型事件加以处理。
    陕西省醴泉县四区四乡原乡长坏分子杨茂林，曾在国民党匪军中当过多年副连长。那时即与地主、伪保甲人员勾结，欺压农民。解放后假装进步，伪造历史，欺骗人民政府，当了乡长，并混入共产党。一九五○年冬，该乡土地改革刚开始，杨茂林就接受地主贿赂，极力限制农民积极分子发言，诬蔑他们
    “不懂政策，捣乱会场”，公开辱骂贫雇农是“昏猪闷狗”、“二流子”、“小偷”。他对中农说：“你们是中农，为什么也跟那些人乱跑？斗下地主东西也落不到你们名下。”他指使地主的爪牙们在评成份会上替地主多报劳动力和人口，隐瞒土地和债务关系，保护地主漏网过关；然后再向区里作假报告，骗得上级批准。当时窃据农会主任职位的地主爪牙高尚文，也接受了地主的贿赂，与杨茂林共同压制农民斗争。为此，农民积极分子首先向区、县要求罢免高尚文的农会主任职务。杨茂林为应付上级和群众，就叫高尚文的儿子高志俊接当农会主任。同时杨茂林想到要保持自己的统治，非离间群众和上级的关系不可。为达到这一目的，他实行了一系列的阴谋活动。首先是在征收公粮等工作中有意地采用强迫命令的办法，使人民埋怨政府。群众一时交不齐粮，他就派民兵到处搜粮，逼得农民含着眼泪卖牛交粮。段家崖一孤寡户一时交不出粮，他们就把小孩拉走，把老太太踢倒。杨茂林扬言说：“这是上级命令”！“公事公办”！然后他就向上级报告：“公粮全部完成！”区里也就盲目地把杨茂林当成“好乡长”，在干部会上、群众会上表扬他。然后，杨茂林又勾结区公安助理员张志谦（原伪人员），互相称兄道弟，要张利用职权陷害好人，把反对杨茂林罪恶的人都诬为“挑是生非”、“攻击乡长”的“坏分子”。同时把杨茂林的亲信安插为“农会主任”、“治安主任”等，对于与群众有密切联系、对地主坚决进行斗争的村干部，则给以打击和撤换。
    进行了上述种种阴谋活动以后，杨茂林就更猖狂地破坏农民运动。他在各村召开群众大会，宣布：
    “上级有命令，不许告地主了。”他威胁农民说：“谁再告地主，就是反革命捣乱乡村政权。”并要“各村干部、民兵好好地给我监视着，谁再活动告地主，就给我往乡政府送。”地主和地主的爪牙则趾高气扬，明查暗访，发现群众三两个人在一起谈话，就秘密报告杨茂林，给以打击。小沼高村地主高树林弟兄发现本村农民高甲、高志明、张子明等写材料向上级揭发他们的真实成份，就在夜间到杨茂林处告密。第二天清早，杨茂林就到小沼高村召开群众大会，在大会上把高志明等三人和帮助他们写材料的王志建痛骂了两个钟头，还动手打了张子明。高志明和高甲二人一同去尧都村，被小学教员李景明、马明玉（都是伪人员、解放后混入党内）看见，就报告到乡政府。杨茂林就和支部书记阎文章、区干部张建国等赶出来把高志明和高甲带到乡政府审问。杨茂林说：“你们不是告地主吗？我这里就是公堂！”一九五○年夏历十二月，杨茂林和区公安助理员张志谦从县公安局保出地主一贯道首高树杰（杨受贿四十万元）。这事被小沼高村农民高彦秀发觉，杨茂林就持枪去威胁高彦秀：
    “不许对人说！”高彦秀不顾威胁，到醴泉县人民政府控告，县府一科科员门镇邦打电话把这件事交给四区区政府查办，区里又叫杨茂林的帮凶张志谦查办。于是张志谦就和杨茂林策划陷害高彦秀。他们以“诬告乡长”的罪名，把高彦秀捕到区里，当时的四区区长段复兴把高彦秀打了一顿，最后送到县人民法院去法办。县人民法院没有审问，就把高彦秀关押了七十多天。以后县法院明知押错了，也只是以“在服劳役期间表现好”为理由，将高彦秀释放了事。一九五一年夏历三月，尧都村农会小组长王怀清到县人民法院控告杨茂林私扣军鞋和群众的麦子。县人民法院又将此事转区查处。区干部张建国和杨茂林又以“诬告乡长”的罪名判王怀清“服三个月的劳役。”这一处理，也是经区长段复兴批准的。区县干部的庇护纵容，更助长了杨茂林等坏分子的气焰。杨茂林时常可以随意下令捆绑吊打对他不满的农民，或亲自用鞋底、板凳、铁丝绳、枪探条、皮鞭等打人。群众时常被打得头破血流，遍体鳞伤，甚至卧床不起。仅杨茂林自己就毒打过二十二人。打过以后，还要挨打的人摆酒席道歉或下跪认罪，才肯罢休。一次，一个工作人员到小沼杨家村贫农杨贤家调查该乡情况，杨茂林就在群众大会上骂杨贤：“把你先人的文书匣子翻开查查，你先人手里告过人没有？你敢告人？”藉此，他讹了杨贤三斗麦子，逼得杨贤把七个月的男孩也卖了。
    杨茂林的黑暗统治，终于征服不了农民。农民们在每次正义斗争受到坏分子和官僚主义分子的打击后，便秘密召开会议，互相安慰，鼓舞斗志。他们说：“只要有毛主席共产党给咱做主，杨茂林再厉害也挡不住。”农民的这种秘密会是借打柴、拾粪作掩护，溜到野外或破庙里去开的。他们不断地推举代表到上级控告。各村的群众代表又利用赶集上会作掩护进行联络，并公推六十多岁的老农民李逢吉做全乡的总代表到省里去控告。
    一九五一年夏历九月三十日，李逢吉写了一封控告杨茂林的信挂号寄给陕西省人民政府，但只是由陕西省人民监察委员会把这封信转出去了事。李逢吉等了二十多天不见回信，就又到醴泉县委会去控告。县委会的收发不让他进去，说：“去人民政府告吧！”李逢吉把状子塞进收发室的窗口，但也没有得到任何回响。十二月间，李逢吉又亲手交给该乡查田定产工作组组长乔润和一张控诉状。十二月中旬，这张诉状又转到区。区干部认定杨茂林是
    “好乡长”，告状人是“坏分子”，仍叫杨茂林去
    “教育群众”。这时县委组织部长雷兆春（现任醴泉县委副书记）正在四区工作，他不调查不研究，就轻信区乡干部的话，也同意这样做。杨茂林得到县、区官僚主义分子的支持，就在十二月二十五日召开全乡群众大会斗争李逢吉。会上，工作组长乔润和也以“不坦白就冻一夜”来威逼李逢吉坦白“诬告乡长、捣乱乡政权”的错误。李逢吉没有屈服，反而当众揭露了杨茂林的各种罪恶。杨茂林等羞恼成怒，便把李逢吉送区“法办”。区干部卢宏昌取得区长马超、区委副书记苟靖华的同意，逼迫李逢吉写“悔过书”，承认“错误”，并要他去给杨茂林道歉，另外还判他受“农村管制”。李逢吉回家后，既没认错也没去道歉，又到醴泉县委会去控告。从一九五一年十二月二十八日到一九五二年一月，他前后到县委会去过四次：两次被卫兵阻止，未能入内；一次由县委研究员曹振清接见，答应转告负责同志研究处理。最后一次他先见到了县委代理秘书张思温，张过去听区干部反映过李逢吉是“坏人”，见面只讽刺了一句：“你就是久务辞讼（爱惹是非）的李逢吉啊！”就走开了。李逢吉又去见雷兆春，雷兆春对李逢吉的话根本听不进去。李逢吉说杨茂林包庇地主、贪污受贿、打骂群众；雷兆春就说：“地主成份是由县上决定的，杨茂林想包庇也包不住。”“杨茂林受地主的贿你亲眼看见了没有？”“杨茂林打骂群众是错误的，但已检讨过了。”当李逢吉坚持要求惩办杨茂林时，雷兆春说：“处分杨茂林是政府的事，你要愿意告，到法院去告。”李逢吉临走时问这事到底怎么办？雷兆春说：“材料给你转到区里去了，该怎办就怎办。”李逢吉刚一回到家，区干部卢宏昌和杨茂林就以“写了悔过书又去告人”的罪名，要把李逢吉捆绑送区。这事激怒了群众，数十人蜂拥而上，拦住不让绑李逢吉，并要把卢、杨二人送县。在群众的义愤下，卢宏昌、杨茂林当时没敢把李逢吉绑走。第二天卢宏昌却又派人把李逢吉带到区上，一面谩骂，一面威胁说：“你就是告到中央去，也得经过这里办。”区委副书记苟靖华在吃饭时讽刺李逢吉说：“你是工属，本来应该给你饭吃，但你犯了人民的法律，不能给你吃。”
    三反运动开展以后，咸阳专区（注：现已撤销）公安处派张维瀛（现任醴泉县公安局副局长、县委委员）到醴泉县帮助工作。张维瀛看材料时，发现了群众揭发杨茂林等勾结地主、陷害检举人高彦秀的一封信，当即派刘志俊、谢登科到该乡进行调查。刘、谢二人一到该乡，立刻受到坏分子高志俊的监视。他们到高彦秀家去调查，杨茂林竟以“不带介绍信，私入坏人家”为理由，要捆绑刘、谢二人。刘、谢被迫返县。高志俊、杨茂林等当夜又把高彦秀非法逮捕到区关押。区委副书记苟靖华见到高彦秀时说：“你说干部黑暗，今天也要把你黑暗一下。”高彦秀的父亲第二天哭诉到县，张维瀛把这事转告前县长王英。王不相信，说：“他们那里敢这样！”后经打电话查对，才相信了。王英虽然在电话中批评了苟靖华这样作不对，也派干部下去调查过，但最后只是把杨茂林叫到县里，由县人民监察委员会干部轻描淡写地对杨批评了一下就算完事。杨回乡后得意地说：
    “县里也没把我怎么着，县里说我没错误。”张维瀛坚持要把问题弄清，就又派县公安局干部刘志谦到该乡调查。刘去后深入群众，经过个别访问和秘密调查，并接受了群众四十余张诉状，基本上弄清了杨茂林等把持乡政权，包庇地主，迫害群众等罪行。他在调查报告中明确指出：“杨茂林问题的实质是阶级斗争。”张维瀛又把分散在县级各机关的数十份群众控告杨茂林的诉状集中一起，连同刘志谦的调查报告分送县的各有关单位，请他们研究处理。雷兆春（当时已升任县委代理书记）只粗粗看了看报告，就仍肯定杨茂林问题是“作风”问题，毫无根据地说刘志谦的调查材料“夸大”。以后又借口
    “三反”运动忙，就把这事搁下了。这时杨茂林又向区里反映说：“刘志谦下乡走的是坏人路线”，“给乡里工作造成许多困难。”他跑到区里向区委副书记苟靖华、区长马超请求“辞职”。马超说：“区上给你撑腰。”苟靖华说：“组织替你负责。”杨茂林得到支持，就又跑回乡去大骂给刘志谦反映材料的人说：“看你们狗东西能把我怎么样？”以后，群众继续向县里揭发杨茂林的罪行，县里又派监委会干部刘益民下去调查，并把杨茂林再次调县审查。但县长、县委书记仍未亲自问一问，就根据刘益民与杨茂林谈话的结果，认为杨茂林“工作积极，只是作风不好。”为了平息群众愤怒，他们决定把杨茂林和三乡乡长刘清贵对调了事。杨茂林得到消息，一面拖延不办交接手续，不离四乡；一面通过其亲信分子给县级各机关及中共中央西北局、咸阳专署等处写信，说：“杨茂林工作积极，立场很稳，掌握政策灵活，能为穷人谋利益”，“他唯一的缺点就是对坏分子过于严肃”，“要求政府对诬告杨茂林的坏分子给以严重打击”。群众看到杨茂林迟迟不离四乡，又派代表到县人民政府去催问，向民政科长刘彪彬提出：如杨茂林不走，群众就要搬走。这时刘彪彬才打电话限令杨茂林当日离开四乡。但苟靖华、马超却向县里反映：“县里处理杨茂林问题有偏差，干部群众都不满意，四乡的工作因此而落后了。”实际上是杨茂林的爪牙故意抗拒缴纳农业税等任务，想迫使上级调回杨茂林。杨茂林调到三乡以后，在其忠实爪牙支持下，仍然统治着四乡，并回四乡去打过农民杨永信。但县领导干部仍不醒悟，对坏分子仍未作任何处理。
    直至一九五二年八月咸阳专署人民监察处派检查组去四乡调查杨茂林案件时，全乡仍然笼罩着恐怖的气氛。经过多方解除群众顾虑，反复对证，才将杨茂林的罪行大体调查清楚，杨茂林也被迫在群众面前承认了错误，醴泉县人民政府扩大会议也决议将杨茂林撤职法办。杨茂林在押期间，向雷兆春打听为什么押他，雷告诉他原因是“屡教不改，三反以后还打人”。杨茂林弄清了这个“底细”，就先向县法院“请假”。县法院审判员赵显未经领导干部批准，就擅自把杨茂林放回。杨茂林回去后，就通过该乡代理支部书记李之正召集他的亲信分子李景明、杨永治等开“支部大会”，并用这个“支部”的名义写信证明杨茂林没有打杨永信，还派了“支部代表”到县委会、县政府和县法院去作证。杨茂林在四乡各村的亲信分子同时造谣威吓农民：“刘县长说了，杨茂林还要到四乡当乡长……”在写给县政府的证明信上，杨茂林等竟把因被杨殴打而正向法院控告的杨永信的名字也签上了。县长刘新怀看到后虽发生怀疑，但也不追究。雷兆春即以杨茂林不承认打人的事为理由，打电话告诉县法院暂时不要关押杨茂林。杨茂林曾把贫农杨永祥的庄基分给他的亲信分子杨彦明，还辱骂杨永祥；杨永祥到区里去告，区干部刘芳、刘子谦等不管，使杨永祥最后愤极自杀。杨永祥的死又激起了群众公愤，死者家属也多次到县法院去控告。杨茂林为应付这件事，就指使亲信分子李景明等编造谣言，说“杨永祥是强奸儿媳未遂羞愧自杀的。”县法院书记员纪逢杰前往调查时，又听信了李景明等的谣言，不予处理。直到杨永祥家属向陕西省人民监察委员会和咸阳专署控告，咸阳专署人民监察处打电话给醴泉县长刘新怀，批评了他不执行会议决议，不严肃处理杨茂林问题以后，县法院才将杨茂林关押起来。接着咸阳专署人民监察处郭云山会同醴泉县监察委员会许景瑶再次深入群众调查，才查清杨永祥自杀的真相。十二月，中共陕西省委纪律检查委员会从西安群众日报得到有关杨茂林违法乱纪以及醴泉县领导干部严重官僚主义的材料，协同西北人民监察委员会等单位，组织工作组去该县进行检查。工作组初到四乡调查时，基本农民都远离工作组。他们说：“调查八、九次了，一回也顶不了事，小心话说的多了，闯下大祸来。”后来经工作组反复讲解政策，揭破杨茂林集团坏分子的造谣恐吓，并大力争取犯错误的党员干部，才将上述情况彻底弄清。现正着手整顿该地中共支部和乡村政权，并正研究对违法失职的干部予以处分。
