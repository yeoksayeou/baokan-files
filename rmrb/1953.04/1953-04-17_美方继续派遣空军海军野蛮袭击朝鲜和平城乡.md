Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th. The U.S. side continues to dispatch its Air Force and Navy to carry out indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in the rear of Korea.

　　Since April 7th, Pyongyang, Nampho, Wonsan, Anju, Sukchon, and many other cities and villages have been subjected to savage attacks by U.S. aircraft. The targets of the U.S. aircraft are: residential areas and farmers who are carrying out spring plowing and sowing in the fields. For example, at about 3:00 p.m. on April 9th, enemy Mustang aircraft formations attacked the rural areas of Anbyon County, southeast of Wonsan, and frantically strafed the farmers who were carrying out spring plowing and sowing. That night, enemy bombers attacked a residential area of Anbyon County three times in succession, dropping various bombs and incendiary bombs, resulting in the destruction of many houses and the killing of many women and children.

　　At the same time, the U.S. Navy has also been bombarding the rural areas around Wonsan and the farmers busy with spring plowing and sowing for days. The heroic Korean and Chinese People's Army has never relaxed its vigilance, and they have dealt a heavy blow to the invading enemy forces.

    美方继续派遣空军海军野蛮袭击朝鲜和平城乡
    【新华社平壤十六日电】美方继续派遣空军、海军对朝鲜后方的和平城乡施行狂轰滥炸。
    从四月七日以来，平壤、南浦、元山、安州、肃川以及其他许多城市乡村又受到美机的野蛮袭击。美机袭击的目标是：居民区和正在田地中进行春耕播种的农民。例如：四月九日下午三时许，敌野马式机编队袭击元山东南的安边郡农村，疯狂地扫射正在进行春耕播种的农民。当天夜间，敌轰炸机又连续三次袭击安边郡的一个居民区，投下各种炸弹和烧夷弹，结果有许多民房被破坏，许多妇女和儿童被杀害。
    同时，美国海军也连日对元山市周围农村和忙于春耕播种的农民进行轰击。英勇的朝中人民军队一刻也没有放松警惕，他们给了前来侵犯的敌军以沉重的打击。
