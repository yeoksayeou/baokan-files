Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The March issue of the Japanese magazine "Peace" published an article introducing the activities of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace, saying: The Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace has played a significant role in promoting Japan's peace movement. It was established in August 1950 at the initiative of Ikuo Oyama and has now been in existence for two and a half years.

The article summarizes the achievements of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace, saying: In 1950, the Stockholm Appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons garnered 5.5 million signatures in Japan. In 1951, the signatures requesting a peace pact among the five major powers and opposing rearmament while calling for an overall peace treaty were endorsed by six million people. In 1952, a signature campaign was launched to demand an immediate end to the Korean War and to oppose conscription and the "Police Reserve Force" (predecessor of the current "Security Force"), obtaining 3.5 million signatures.

In addition, to promote and popularize the idea of peace, small-scale research groups and lecture teams were organized, lecturers were sent to lectures throughout the country, and peace "magic lantern shows," cartoon exhibitions, and peace art exhibitions were held. Furthermore, atomic bomb picture exhibitions by painters Toshiko Akamatsu and Iri Maruki, as well as atomic bomb photo exhibitions, were held nationwide, attracting approximately five million viewers. These exhibitions are still touring various parts of Japan. Other activities include publishing the organ "Peace News" and publishing magazines and pamphlets to promote the peace movement.

The Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace also calls for August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's armistice, to be designated as Peace Month every year, promoting various forms of peace movements throughout the country, such as peace gatherings, peace festivals, peace dances, and peace conferences.

Japan's peace movement has not only promoted the movement against the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," as well as the movement against military bases throughout the country, but also supported other citizens' daily demands, making efforts to boost the peace movement.

The article then introduces the activities of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace in strengthening international ties, saying: The Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace is in contact with the World Peace Council and works closely with peace committees in various countries. The Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace has done much work in the participation of Japanese representatives in international economic conferences, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and the World People's Peace Congress.

The article lists the program of the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace as follows:

	1. Oppose war, defend peace and independence.
	2. Shout the voice of peace in every corner of the country to prevent the revival of militarism.
	3. Resolve international disputes through consultation rather than by force. Maintain friendly relations with every country.
	4. Respect the independence of all nations and absolutely oppose any country interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.
	5. Freely trade with all countries in the world, especially Asian countries, and vigorously promote scientific and cultural exchanges.
	6. Absolutely oppose the use of atomic bombs, bacteriological weapons, and other cruel weapons of mass slaughter.
	7. Uphold the peaceful constitution, oppose the stationing of foreign troops, oppose militarization, oppose conscription and rearmament, and realize an overall peace treaty as soon as possible.
	8. Stop fascism, safeguard basic human rights, stop military production, and develop peaceful industries.
	9. Regardless of ideology, belief, political party, occupation, or ethnicity, strive to unite the people internally to strive for peace, and cooperate with world peace forces externally.
