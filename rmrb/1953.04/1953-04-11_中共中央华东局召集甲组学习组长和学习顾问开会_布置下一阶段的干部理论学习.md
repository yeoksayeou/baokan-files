According to the "Liberation Daily," to further advance the theoretical study of senior cadres in East China's first-level organs, the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau held its third joint meeting of Group A study group leaders and study advisors on March 26. The meeting was presided over by Shu Tong, Director of the East China Bureau's Propaganda Department, and Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the East China Bureau, gave important instructions. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Shu Tong first gave a general speech on the current state of study and future study issues. Comrade Shu Tong pointed out: After the study of the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin is completed, one week must be used to summarize the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Group A must conduct a serious examination to check the effectiveness of the study; it is also necessary to write a study report or paper by group, which will be reviewed or exhibited by the Propaganda Department. Then, the new study should begin no later than April 10. According to the plan: Group A will spend April and May studying "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR"; Group B will spend the same time studying the first four chapters of "Reader of Common Knowledge on Economic Construction"; later, Groups A and B will simultaneously study the chapters after Chapter 9 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course"; Group C will begin studying "Reader of Common Knowledge on Economic Construction"; units that have not systematically studied "Reader of Common Knowledge on Politics" can first study Chapters 1 and 2 of "Reader of Common Knowledge on Politics". In view of the fact that some units had relaxed the study system before studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin, he asked everyone to pay strict attention to ensuring the study system.

Next, Comrade Chen Yi spoke. He first conveyed the opinions of the Central Committee and the East China Bureau, calling on everyone to persevere in the political theory study of cadres. Senior cadres should not only lead the cadres of their own organs to study, but also regard themselves as members of the study team. Only in this way can the theoretical study of cadres be sustained and not become a formality. He pointed out that because senior cadres have many things to do and are busy with work, it is necessary to properly resolve the contradiction between work and study, so that study does not hinder work, and work does not hinder study. Going to school for study is certainly the best way, but it is currently impossible to do so for everyone. Only adhering to on-the-job study is the most reliable method. He also listed and analyzed the reasons for some deviations and errors in practical work, believing that the root cause is that the Marxist-Leninist level of cadres is too low, so he hoped that everyone would intensify their theoretical study. He said: Studying theory for two and a half days a week may seem to hinder business, but the result will definitely strengthen business. Studying theory cannot be effective immediately, which requires patience. After several years of study, there will naturally be a "sudden understanding" and some gains. Secondly, he asked everyone not to be afraid of making mistakes when studying. There is always a brewing process for starting to learn a subject. Only by fully exercising free thought and展开争论，才能对某一个问题有一个正确的认识。 This is the attitude that should be taken to master and adhere to theoretical study. He particularly pointed out that attention should be paid to cultivating cadres' interest in studying theory. With interest in studying, they will "strive for it day and night, as if cutting and polishing jade," and persevere in their studies. He also expressed that he would study theory with everyone in the future, organize inspections to check whether anyone has fallen behind in their studies, whether work and study are hindering each other, and whether there is formalism that is ineffective. His words greatly encouraged the comrades present. Finally, Comrade Chen Yi also answered the questions raised by various units in studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin.

After Comrade Chen Yi's speech, Comrade Shu Tong asked everyone to take Comrade Chen Yi's instructions to heart, and convey them in light of the specific situation of their own organs, earnestly solve the unresolved problems in the study, and avoid ending it hastily. Finally, Comrade Kuang Yaming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau, made supplementary remarks on issues such as rectifying the study organization.

    中共中央华东局召集甲组学习组长和学习顾问开会
    布置下一阶段的干部理论学习
    据解放日报消息：为了把华东一级机关高级干部的理论学习向前推进一步，中共中央华东局特于三月二十六日召开第三次甲组学习组长及学习顾问联席会议，由华东局宣传部长舒同同志主持，华东局第二书记陈毅同志作了重要指示。会议开始时，舒同同志首先就目前学习情况及今后学习问题作了概括的发言。舒同同志指出：在学习悼念斯大林同志文件结束后，须以一周时间总结苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件的学习，甲组要认真地考试一下，以检查学习的效果；还必须以组为单位写一篇学习心得或论文，由宣传部加以评阅或展览。然后至迟于四月十日以前开始新的学习。按计划规定：甲组以四、五两月时间学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”；乙组以同样时间学习“经济建设常识读本”前四章；以后甲、乙组同时学习“联共（布）党史简明教程”第九章以后的各章；丙组则开始学习“经济建设常识读本”；未系统学习过“政治常识读本”的单位，可先学习“政治常识读本”第一、二两章。鉴于有些单位在学习悼念斯大林同志文件之前，学习制度曾有松弛现象，他要求大家严格注意保证学习制度。
    接着，陈毅同志讲话。他首先传达中央与华东局的意见，号召大家一定要把干部政治理论学习坚持下去。高级干部不仅要领导本机关干部学习，而且要把自己作为学习队伍里的一员，只有这样，干部的理论学习才能坚持；不致流于形式。他指出：由于高级干部事情多，工作忙，要很好解决工作与学习的矛盾，既要使学习不妨碍工作，又要使工作不妨碍学习。进学校学习固然是最好的办法，但目前还不可能都做到，只有坚持在职学习是最可靠的办法。他并列举和分析了实际工作中的某些偏向和错误所产生的原因，认为归根结柢是由于干部的马克思列宁主义水平太低，所以希望大家要加紧理论学习。他说：每周以两个半天学习理论，看起来似乎有点妨碍业务，但结果是一定会加强业务的。学习理论不可能立即见效，这就需要有耐心，经过几年的学习，自然会“豁然贯通”有所收获。其次，他要大家在学习时不要怕错，开始学一门功课总是有一个酝酿过程，只有充分发挥自由思想，展开争论，才能对某一个问题有一个正确的认识。这是掌握和坚持理论学习应有的态度。他特别指出，要注意培养干部学习理论的兴趣，学习有了兴趣，就会“朝斯夕斯，如琢如磨”，把学习坚持下去。他并表示今后要和大家一齐学习理论，要组织检查，检查学习中有没有掉队的，有没有把工作和学习互相妨碍的，有没有形式主义收不到效果的。他的话给到会同志以很大的鼓舞。末了，陈毅同志并解答了各单位在学习悼念斯大林同志文件中所提出的问题。
    陈毅同志讲话后，舒同同志即要大家很好记取陈毅同志的指示，并结合本机关具体情况进行传达，认真解决学习中未解决的问题，避免草率结束。最后，华东局宣传部副部长匡亚明同志就整顿学习组织等问题作了补充发言。
