    Northeast China, due to the rapid development of its petroleum industry and the active organization of supply by state-owned commerce, is seeing extensive use of oil in many transportation vehicles and for rural lighting.

    In the past, especially during the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang rule, almost all automobiles used by the people in the Northeast burned charcoal. On highways and city streets, it was common to see charcoal cars "broken down," with passengers anxiously watching the driver laboriously cranking the blower, the charcoal stove spewing thick smoke and sparks. Now, the number of charcoal cars in the Northeast has been greatly reduced, and in cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, and Anshan, charcoal cars have almost disappeared. Many cars speeding on the highways now burn gasoline. On the highway from Shenyang to Fushun, this change has shortened travel time by a quarter.

    Tugboats navigating inland rivers such as the Songhua River used to burn mostly firewood, but now many have been converted to burn diesel. Some of the fishermen in the Liaodong Peninsula who are organized for production have begun to use motorized sailing boats powered by oil to fish in waters further from the shore.

    The vast rural areas of Northeast China have also begun to widely use kerosene lamps. Last year, the Northeast China Company of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Corporation sold approximately 30,000 tons of kerosene and 900,000 glass-shaded kerosene lamps in rural areas. The northern half of Heilongjiang Province has the longest winter nights in our country. Last year, many farmers there studied culture and engaged in sideline production under bright kerosene lamps, whereas previously they used vegetable oil lamps; before liberation, many farm families could only burn a type of pine branch with a high resin content for light.

    The petroleum production in the Northeast region has increased approximately threefold in the past two years. The Northeast China Company of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Corporation supplied the region with approximately the same amount of oil for public and private use in 1952 as it did in the total sales volume for 1950 and 1951. This year, state-owned commerce plans to increase the supply of oil by another 50% compared to last year. The price of oil has also decreased, with gasoline and kerosene each being reduced by about 45%.

    东北人民已大量使用石油
    东北区由于石油工业的迅速发展和国营商业积极组织供应，许多交通工具和农村照明已大量使用着石油。
    过去，尤其是在伪满和国民党统治时期，东北境内供人民乘用的汽车几乎全部是烧木炭的。在公路上和大城市的街道上，常常可以看到“抛锚”的木炭汽车，乘客们焦急地望着司机吃力地摇着吹风机，木炭炉喷着浓烟和火星。现在东北境内的木炭汽车已大大减少了，沈阳、旅大、鞍山等城市里，木炭汽车几已绝迹。许多公路上飞驶着的，都已是烧汽油的汽车。在沈阳到抚顺这条公路上，由于这种改变，长途汽车行驶时间缩短了四分之一。
    航行在松花江等内河上的拖轮，过去多烧木柴，现在很多已经改烧柴油。辽东半岛沿海组织起来生产的渔民，有一部分已开始驾着用石油作燃烧动力的机器帆船到离岸较远的海面上捕鱼。
    东北广大农村也开始普遍使用煤油灯。去年，中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司在农村里约出售了三万吨煤油和九十万盏玻璃罩的煤油灯。黑龙江省北半部是我国冬夜最长的地方，去年，那里很多农民在明亮的煤油灯下学文化和进行副业生产，而以前他们点的都是植物油灯；在没有解放的时候，很多农家只能烧一种含树脂较多的松枝取亮。
    东北区的石油生产量过去两年间约提高了两倍。中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司一九五二年供给全区公需民用的石油约和一九五零、一九五一两年的总销售量相等，今年国营商业准备供应的石油比去年还要增加百分之五十。石油的价格也降低了，其中汽油、煤油各降价百分之四十五左右。
