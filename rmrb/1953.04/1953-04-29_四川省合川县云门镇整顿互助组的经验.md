The Hechuan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan Province sent a work team to Yunmen Town, Eleventh Village at the end of last year to rectify the mutual aid teams and gained initial experience in rectifying mutual aid teams.

When the work team proposed to the masses to rectify the mutual aid teams, the general public said that there were "no problems" within the mutual aid teams. But in reality, there were quite a few problems within the mutual aid teams.

Why did the general public say there were no problems? The work team decided to go deep into the masses to understand their true thoughts. Members of the work team participated in the mutual aid team's work evaluation and scorekeeping meetings, worked with the peasants, and chatted casually from time to time. They slowly discovered that the masses had two incorrect views on rectifying the mutual aid teams: One was an "it doesn't matter" attitude, believing that the work evaluation and scorekeeping was not unreasonable, but rather "taking a loss is the way to get along." The other was a "saving face" mentality, knowing that their mutual aid team had shortcomings, but fearing being laughed at if they were exposed. Therefore, some mutual aid team members had opinions in their hearts but were unwilling to express them publicly.

After the work team cadres understood the situation, they repeatedly carried out propaganda and education among the peasants, criticizing the idea of "taking a loss is the way to get along," and pointed out that the mutual aid teams could only be consolidated by implementing the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. In the propaganda and education work, the policy of mutual aid and cooperation was explained to the masses, clarifying the significance and purpose of rectifying the mutual aid teams. This gradually improved the masses' understanding of the mutual aid teams.

In order to rectify the mutual aid teams, the district leading organs decided to start by mobilizing the masses to inspect each other's production.

When the Ming He Zong mutual aid team inspected the production of the Jiang He Qing mutual aid team, He Qing'an, a member of the Jiang He Qing mutual aid team, said: "When sowing wheat, everyone rushed to plant, each doing their own thing, which delayed the sowing time." The members of the group also linked this issue and talked about the main problem in the group being the lack of serious work evaluation and scorekeeping. In the past, everyone had opinions on this point, but they were unwilling to talk about it, which actually hindered production. When the groups inspected each other's cattle problems, it was found that out of the 112 and a half cattle in the village (one cow was jointly raised with peasants from another village), 42 were sick. Some mutual aid teams blindly concentrated the cattle for feeding, but did not assign specific personnel to be responsible; the cattle prices and labor prices between cattle owners and feeders were also unreasonable.

Through the inspection of production, the cadres of the work team further realized that the common problem within the mutual aid teams was the failure to earnestly implement the "equivalent exchange and mutual benefit" policy. Therefore, in the work of rectifying the mutual aid teams, education was carried out among the peasants with the implementation of "equivalent exchange and mutual benefit" as the center.

The Zhou Yuan He mutual aid team originally valued and collectivized all the large and small farm tools, which resulted in those with farm tools having concerns and those lacking farm tools not having money to pay the price. There were opinions between them, which seriously affected the consolidation of the mutual aid team. The group focused on solving this key problem, stipulating that large farm tools should be "privately owned, publicly used, and maintained in value." If the farm tools were old or broken, everyone would contribute money to repair them. The group members were very satisfied with this point. On this basis, the problem of excessively low wages in the past was further resolved. Zhou Changming and Zhou Zhiquan's son, who were unwilling to work together in the past due to excessively low wages, actively participated in production with everyone again; even Zhou Yuanhe's wife, who had never participated in the mutual aid team, also joined the mutual aid team and started working with everyone.

After the rectification of the mutual aid teams, the production enthusiasm of the team members was improved. Many mutual aid teams, in view of the excessive rainfall in winter and the yellowing of wheat, actively dug drainage ditches and weeded the wheat. Many mutual aid teams launched team members to formulate livestock protection covenants. The better mutual aid teams further formulated the 1953 patriotic production increase plan. In the short period of several days after the rectification of the mutual aid teams, the peasants of the whole village dug 3,698 catties of rice roots and accumulated 185,000 catties of compost in order to control rice borers. Now everyone is actively building two ponds. The peasants are full of confidence and are actively carrying out spring plowing to complete the 1953 production increase task.

    四川省合川县云门镇整顿互助组的经验
    蓝鸿文
    中共四川省合川县云门区委员会，在去年年底派出一个工作组，到云门镇十一村整理互助组，取得了整顿互助组的初步经验。
    当工作组向群众提出要整顿互助组的时候，一般群众都说，互助组内“没有问题”。但实际上互助组内的问题是很不少的。
    为什么一般群众都说没有问题呢？工作组决定深入群众，了解群众的真实思想情况。工作组员参加互助组的评工记分会议，和农民一起做活、随时漫谈，慢慢发现群众对整理互助组有两种不正确的看法：一种是“无所谓”的态度。认为评工记分不是不合理，而是“吃得亏才打得堆”。一种是“爱面子”的心理，明知自己的互助组有缺点，但害怕露出来被别人笑话。因此，有些互助组组员心里虽然有意见，却不愿公开提出来。
    工作组干部心里有了底后，就反复对农民进行宣传教育，批判了那种“吃得亏才打得堆”的思想，指出互助组只有贯彻自愿、互利原则，才能得到巩固。在宣传教育工作中，向群众交代互助合作的政策，讲明整顿互助组的意义和目的。这样就逐渐提高了群众对互助组的认识。
    为了把互助组整顿好，区领导机关决定从发动群众互相检查生产情况入手。
    明和宗互助组检查蒋和清互助组的生产情况时，蒋和清互助组的组员何清安说：“点麦子时，大家都抢种，各干各，结果耽误了播种时间。”该组的组员们又联系这个问题，谈出组内的主要问题是评工记分不认真。过去大家对这一点都有意见，但又不愿意谈，实际上妨碍了生产。各组在互相检查耕牛问题时，发现全村一百一十二条半牛（有一只牛是和外村的农民伙养的），其中就有四十二条生病。有的互助组盲目地把耕牛集中到一起喂养，但没有确定专人负责；有牛户和饲养者的牛价、工价也不合理。
    通过检查生产情况，工作组的干部进一步认识到互助组内普遍存在的问题，是没有认真贯彻“等价互利”政策。因此，在整顿互助组的工作中，便以贯彻“等价互利”为中心，对农民进行了教育。
    周元和互助组原来把大小农具都作价归公了，结果有农具的人有顾虑，缺农具的人无钱付价，彼此之间都有意见，严重地影响到互助组的巩固。该组着重解决了这个关键问题，规定大农具采取“私有、公用、保值”的办法，农具用旧了、用坏了，大家出钱修理。组员们对这一点很满意。在这个基础上，又进一步地解决了过去工资过低的问题。原来因工资过低不愿伙干的周昌明和周至全的儿子，又积极地和大家一起生产了；就连从来不参加互助组的周元和的老婆也参加互助组和大伙一块干起活来了。
    互助组经过整顿以后，组员们的生产积极性提高了。许多互助组鉴于冬天雨水过多，小麦发黄，就积极挖排水沟，薅小麦。许多互助组发动组员订立了护畜公约。比较好的互助组进一步地订立了一九五三年的爱国增产计划。在整顿互助组以后的短短的数天内，全村农民为了治螟，共挖了稻根三千六百九十八斤，积堆肥十八万五千斤。现在大家正积极兴修两口堰塘。农民们都满怀信心地为完成一九五三年增产任务积极进行春耕。
