How to Run a Good Russian Language Study Class for Employees
Teacher of the Workers' Amateur Russian Language School of the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory, Cheng Yi

In the past three years, more and more employees in Qingdao have been participating in Russian language learning. According to incomplete statistics, twenty state-owned enterprises in the city have successively established amateur Russian language study classes for employees, and some departments are actively preparing to set up such study classes. This is a gratifying phenomenon. We—especially the relevant leading departments and comrades engaged in Russian language teaching—have a responsibility to cultivate and consolidate this enthusiasm for learning among employees. This will enable employees' amateur Russian language learning to take a step forward on the existing foundation. Based on our experience, to run a good Russian language study class (or school) for employees, the following issues need to be resolved:

        Select Students with a Focus
The purpose of Russian language teaching is to enable employees to better learn from the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union after mastering Russian. Therefore, in selecting students, appropriate choices must be made. For example, for a young employee with a lower level of education, the most urgent thing should be to improve their educational level and do their current work well. If they are made to put aside learning Chinese and forced to learn Russian, the result will inevitably be that they neither learn Russian well nor improve their Chinese. Furthermore, for apprentices and trainee workers who have only recently joined production and are not yet skilled in technology, the most important thing should be to learn technology and improve production efficiency. If this important aspect is ignored and they are absorbed into learning Russian, it will inevitably affect their technological improvement due to the dispersion of time and attention, which is detrimental to the entire production.

So, who should be absorbed to participate in learning? Generally speaking, we should focus on absorbing those who currently need to learn Russian the most. The first to be absorbed should be the management personnel, technical personnel in production, and experienced skilled workers in enterprises; followed by general administrative personnel in enterprises. Because, for management personnel, technicians, and skilled workers, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to improve and increase the quantity and quality of production should be their top priority. Once they master the key to learning from the Soviet Union—Russian—they will play a greater role in improving production technology and enterprise management. For those employees whose conditions are slightly worse and are not suitable for learning Russian, or who cannot participate in learning for the time being due to busy production tasks, they should be organized to learn culture and technology to improve their educational and technical levels.

When the Workers' Amateur Russian Language School of the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory was established, because the leadership did not fully recognize this point, there was a phenomenon of randomly absorbing employees to participate in Russian language learning. Therefore, in the first month, the turnover of students was very high. Some students dropped out because they had a low level of education and felt too many difficulties; some gave up learning because they were too busy with their work and could not complete their assignments. For example, three trade union cadres participated in the study, but within two weeks, two of them dropped out; many other people also dropped out (accounting for more than 25% of the total number of students). As a result, we had to merge four classes into three classes. Such a big change caused great difficulties for the teaching work. All regions should learn from this lesson when organizing amateur Russian language study classes for employees.

            Formulate Detailed Plans
To do a good job in Russian language teaching, a detailed plan must be formulated. This plan should not be a formalistic plan; it should be formulated based on the requirements of business work and the conditions of the students. This plan should not only specify what to teach, how to teach, how much time to spend, and what goals to achieve, etc., but also determine the number of people participating in the study based on subjective abilities and objective conditions, and propose ways to ensure the realization of this plan. Therefore, a careless attitude should not be adopted when formulating plans, and various related issues must be carefully considered in advance. After the plan is formulated, it should be submitted to the students for research and discussion. Only in this way can everyone consciously work hard to complete the plan.

In the past, some units' amateur Russian language study classes had no plans. They either formulated plans and carried out work based on the one-sided requirements of a small number of students or according to the teacher's personal "wishes." When their so-called "plans" did not work, they would say, "It's okay, let's do it again." As a result, people participating in Russian language learning wasted a lot of valuable time and energy.

The Workers' Amateur Russian Language School of the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory took many detours in its teaching work because it did not have a detailed plan. The school only started the overall work based on a teaching schedule drawn up by the teacher. The entire school's work had no plan, and no one was specifically responsible for leading it. There was only one teacher, but more than 200 students were absorbed (divided into four classes). With such a large "spread," more and more problems arose. And the solution to the problems was "treat the head when it hurts, and treat the foot when it hurts," so the teacher was caught in the circle of事務ism and had no time to research and improve the teaching work at all.

        Strengthen the Organization of the Study Class
In the past, when some units' amateur Russian language study classes were established, many people participated enthusiastically, but after a period of time, the number of students decreased drastically, and sometimes even the phenomenon of teachers not seeing students in class occurred (this is not an isolated phenomenon in Qingdao). The reason for this is, on the one hand, that students do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of learning Russian and lack sufficient perseverance in learning, and on the other hand, that the learning organization is not sound and lacks necessary learning systems. For example, some units' Russian language study classes are completely disorganized (not to mention any systems). They do not divide into classes or groups. People participating in the study are all gathered in a large room, like listening to a large lecture. In this way, classroom learning becomes disorganized, and extracurricular review falls into a state of laissez-faire. In this case, Russian language teaching work is bound to fail. According to our experience, to overcome this shortcoming, the first thing to do is to strengthen the organization of the amateur Russian language study class for employees. The number of people in each study class should not be too large, and it should be divided into several mutual aid groups (each group with five to seven people is more appropriate). Each class should have one head and one deputy head, and each group should have one leader. The class head and group leader should always maintain close contact with the teacher, exchange teaching opinions, and be responsible for supervising everyone's learning and checking students' learning progress. This will ensure the normal progress of teaching activities. In order to better exert the strength of the masses, leadership must be strengthened. In units with more than three classes, a study committee can be formed, including relevant leaders, teachers, and student representatives. Its task is to discuss and formulate and be responsible for completing teaching plans, research teaching methods, etc. In addition, attendance, test, and other systems should be established, and rewards should be given to those with good grades, and criticism should be given to those with bad grades. Only in this way can the strength of the organization be brought into play and the learning be done well.

A sound organization and necessary systems are an indispensable part of completing teaching work, and the leading comrades' emphasis plays a decisive role in organizational work. Experience has proven that if the leadership cares about this work and frequently provides guidance and assistance, the teaching work can proceed relatively smoothly. If the leadership abandons or relaxes its leadership over Russian language learning and allows it to drift, the result will inevitably be failure. Even if it is reluctantly carried out, the results will not be great.

    怎样搞好职工业余俄文学习班
    国营青岛纺织机械厂职工俄文业余学校教员  成毅
    三年来，青岛市职工参加俄文学习的越来越多。据不完全统计，全市有二十个国营企业单位先后设立了职工业余俄文学习班，有些部门正在积极筹设这种学习班。这是一个可喜的现象。我们——尤其是有关领导部门和从事俄文教学工作的同志，都有责任来培植职工中的这种学习热情，使它巩固起来。这样才能使职工的业余俄文学习在原有的基础上提高一步。根据我们的经验，要搞好职工俄文业余学习班（或学校）的工作，须要解决以下几个问题：
        有重点地吸收学员
    俄文的教学目的，是使职工在掌握俄文之后能更好地学习苏联的先进经验和先进的科学技术。因此在吸收学员时，必须适当地加以选择。比如，对一个文化水平较低的青年职工来讲，最迫切的应该是提高自己的文化水平，作好当前的工作。如果让他放下中文不学，硬来学俄文，其结果必然是俄文既学不好，也耽误了他的文化学习。再如，对参加生产不久、技术上还不熟练的徒工、练习工来说，最重要的应该是学习技术，提高生产效率；假若撇开这重要的一面不管，只顾吸收他们学习俄文，那就必然因为时间和注意力的分散而影响他们在技术上的提高，这对整个生产反而不利。
    那么应该吸收那些人来参加学习呢？一般说，应该有重点地吸收目前最需要学习俄文的人来学习。首先应该吸收参加学习的，是企业中的管理人员、生产中的技术人员和具有较长工龄的技术工人；其次是企业中的一般行政人员。因为，对于管理人员、技术员和技工来说，学习苏联先进经验，以改进和提高生产的数量和质量，应该是他们的头等重要任务。他们一旦掌握了学习苏联的钥匙——俄文，就会在生产技术和企业管理的改进上发挥更大的作用。对于那些因条件稍差不适于学习俄文，或因生产任务繁忙一时不能参加学习的职工，应当组织他们去学习文化和技术，以提高他们的文化水平和技术水平。
    国营青岛纺织机械厂职工业余俄文学校在成立时，因为领导方面对于这一点认识不足，有随便吸收职工参加俄文学习的现象，因此，在最初的一个月中，学员的流动性很大。有些学员因文化程度低，感觉困难太多，而自动退学；有些因业务繁忙，无法完成作业，而放弃了学习。比如有三个工会干部参加了学习，但不到两个星期，就有二人退学了；其他人员退学的也很多（共占学员总数的百分之二十五以上）。这样一来，我们就只好把四个班并成三个班。这样大的变动，给教学工作造成了很大的困难。各地在举办职工俄文业余学习班时，应该接受这个教训。
            制订周密的计划
    要搞好俄文教学，必须订出周密的计划。这计划不能是形式主义的计划，它应该是根据业务工作的要求和学员的条件制订出来的。在这个计划里不但应该规定教什么、怎样教、用多少时间、要达到什么目的等等，并且还要根据主观能力和客观条件确定参加学习的人数，提出保证实现这一计划的办法。因此，在制订计划时不能采取草率的态度，对各种有关的问题，事先必须经过周密的考虑。计划订出以后，要交给学员研究讨论，只有这样才能使大家自觉地为完成计划而努力。
    过去有些单位的职工业余俄文学习班是没有计划的，他们不是凭着少数学员的片面要求，就是按教师个人的“愿望”来制订计划，进行工作。当他们的所谓“计划”行不通时，他们就说：“没啥，再来一次。”以致使参加俄文学习的人浪费了许多宝贵的时间和精力。
    国营青岛纺织机械厂的职工业余俄文学校就是因为没有周密的计划，致使教学工作走了很多的弯路。该校仅仅凭着教师所拟定的一张教学进度表就开始了全盘的工作，整个学校的工作没有计划，也没有专人负责领导。任课教师只有一人，却吸收了二百多个学员（共编四个班）。“摊子”摆得这么大，问题也就越来越多。而解决问题的办法又是“头痛医头”“脚痛医脚”，所以教师就陷入了事务主义的圈子里，根本没有研究和改进教学工作的时间了。
        把学习班的组织健全起来
    过去有些单位的职工业余俄文学习班在成立的时候，参加的人很踊跃，但是过了一段时间，学员便大量地减少，有时甚至发生教员上课见不到学员的现象（这在青岛并不是个别的现象）。究其原因，一方面是由于学员对学习俄文的意义认识不足，在学习上缺乏足够的毅力，另一方面是由于学习组织的不健全，缺少必要的学习制度。例如，有的单位的俄文学习班根本是无组织的（更谈不到什么制度），他们既不分班，也不编组。参加学习的人，都集合在一个大屋子里，像听大课一样。这样，课堂学习就散漫起来，而课外复习也陷于自流状态。在这种情况下，俄文教学工作必然是要失败的。根据我们的经验，要克服这个缺点，首先要健全职工业余俄文学习班的组织。每个学习班的人数不要太多，并且要分成若干互助小组（每组以五人到七人较为适宜）。每班设正副班长各一人，每组设组长一人。班长和组长要经常和任课教师保持密切的联系，交换教学意见，并负责督促大家学习，检查学员的学习情况。这样才能保证教学活动的正常进行。为了更好地发挥群众的力量，必须加强领导，在有三个班级以上的单位可组成包括有关领导同志、教师、学员代表的学习委员会。它的任务是：讨论制订并负责完成教学计划，研究教学方法等等。此外，还要订立考勤、测验等制度，对成绩好的要给予奖励，坏的要予以批评。只有这样，才能发挥组织的力量，搞好学习。
    健全的组织、必要的制度是完成教学工作所不可缺少的部分，而组织工作中起着决定作用的，则是领导同志的重视。经验证明：领导方面假若关怀这一工作，并经常地给予指导和帮助，教学工作就能够比较顺利地进行。如果领导方面对俄文学习放弃或放松领导，任其自流，其结果必然是要失败的。即使勉强搞下去，成绩也是不会大的。
