A letter from Moscow
Dear heroic Volunteer Army soldiers fighting on the Korean front:

We are a group of Chinese students studying far from our homeland, in Moscow, the heart of the world's peace and democracy camp. Countless high mountains, great rivers, deserts, and plains lie between us, but our thoughts and feelings transcend all natural obstacles and merge together. Whenever we receive newspapers and magazines—whether in Chinese or Russian—everyone rushes to read the news about you first. Everyone is eager to know how you are beating the American devils until they lower their heads, beating them until they go crazy in the trenches. Therefore, we are so familiar with your immortal feats in Korea. We can all name and recite the names and deeds of heroes like Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, Sun Zhanyuan, Chen Zhiguo... Every time we finish reading your heroic battle stories, everyone is moved by your heroic spirit and noble qualities. We deeply know that you love the vast mountains and rivers of our motherland, love the newly built factories in our motherland that have chimneys like forests, and love the old men, old women, young men, young women, and children working on the land of our motherland... It is this love that has produced the great strength that you have shown!

Comrades, isn't this what we think too? We study the world's most advanced scientific knowledge and learn from the rich experience of communist construction, with the goal of preparing to return and build our great motherland in the future. Among us, there are those who study electrical engineering, machinery, and water conservancy; those who study railways, shipping, and aircraft manufacturing; those who study mining, metallurgy, petroleum, and geology; those who study physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics; those who study agriculture and medicine; and those who study political law. Needless to say, we have very knowledgeable teachers here, and the most well-equipped classrooms, libraries, and laboratories, but it is very difficult to go from not knowing a word of Russian to being able to speak, listen to lectures, read books, and write articles; from only knowing a little superficial scientific knowledge to mastering profound scientific theories and technologies. But when we think of your heroic battles on the Korean battlefield, and when we think of the urgent expectations of the people of our motherland, we have new strength and the courage to attack the scientific fortress. At present, our academic performance is very good, and many comrades have received full marks in their exams. Now, we make another guarantee to you: we will better complete our study tasks and become strong fighters in the construction posts of our motherland in the future, and build our country as beautiful as the Soviet Union.

Comrades, in the Soviet Union, we also deeply feel how glorious it is to be a Chinese person in the era of Mao Zedong! The Soviet people are so familiar and kind to us. I remember on the night of the October Revolution celebration last year, we took a bus to Red Square to see the lights, and a Soviet soldier was sitting in the same car as us, and he was carrying a child who looked less than four years old. The child looked at us for a long time. The Soviet soldier smiled and asked the child: "Do you recognize these uncles?" The child answered in broken Chinese: "Mao Zedong!" meaning: they came from Mao Zedong. If this is how the children are, needless to say how the adults are. The Soviet people care about everything in our motherland as much as we do, and they care about your heroic battles in Korea. They regard all the victories of the Chinese people as their own victories. Comrades, you are making international contributions! When you return home in triumph in the future, not only will Chairman Mao review you in front of Tiananmen, watch you march proudly in front of Tiananmen, and say to you: "Comrades, you have worked hard!" People all over the world who love peace will celebrate your achievements and gratefully say to you: "Comrades, you have worked hard!" We often think, if any of you come to Moscow one day, how will the Soviet people welcome you!

The entire body of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union

    来自莫斯科的信
    亲爱的战斗在朝鲜前线的志愿军英雄们：
    我们是远离祖国，在世界和平民主阵营堡垒的心脏—莫斯科读书的一群中国留学生。在我们中间，绵亘着无数的高山、大河、沙漠和平原，但是我们的思想感情却超越了一切天然的障碍，融合在一起了。每当我们接到了报纸和杂志—不管是中文的或俄文的，大家都争着首先阅读有关你们的消息。大家都很想知道你们怎样把美国鬼子揍得低下头来，揍得在战壕里发神经病。因此，我们对你们在朝鲜立下的不朽功勋是那样熟悉。像黄继光、邱少云、孙占元、陈治国……这些英雄人物的名字和事迹，我们都能说得来，背得出。每当我们读完你们的英雄战斗故事，大家都为你们那种英雄气概和崇高品质所感动。我们深深知道你们热爱祖国辽阔广大的山河，热爱祖国新建立起来的、烟筒像树林一样的工厂，热爱在祖国土地上劳动着的大爷、大娘、青年、姑娘和小孩子们……。正是这种热爱才产生了像你们表现的那样伟大的力量！
    同志们，我们何尝不是这样想呢？我们学习世界上最先进的科学知识，学习共产主义建设的丰富经验，目的也是准备将来回去建设我们伟大的祖国。在我们中间，有学电机、机械、水利的，有学铁路、航运、飞机制造的，有学采矿、冶金、石油、地质的，有学物理、化学、生物、数学的，有学农、学医的，也有学政治法律的。不用说，我们这里有学识很渊博的老师，有设备最完善的课堂、图书馆和实验室，但是由一个俄文字不会，到可以说话、听讲、看书、写文章；由只懂得一点肤浅的科学知识，到掌握高深的科学理论和技术，是有很多困难的。可是一想到你们在朝鲜战场上的英勇战斗，一想到祖国人民对我们的迫切期望，我们就有了新的力量，就有了攻打科学堡垒的勇气。目前，我们的学习成绩都很好，很多同志在考试中得到了满分。现在再向你们提出保证：我们要更好地完成学习任务，将来做一个祖国建设岗位上的坚强战士，把咱们的国家建设得和苏联一样的美丽。
    同志们，在苏联我们也深深感到做一个毛泽东时代的中国人民是多么荣耀啊！苏联人民对我们是那样熟悉和亲切。记得去年十月革命节的夜晚，我们乘车到红场去看灯火，和我们同车坐着一个苏军同志，他还带着一个看来不到四岁的孩子。孩子很久很久地望着我们。那位苏军同志笑着问孩子：“认得这些叔叔吗？”孩子用生涩的中文回答：“毛泽东！”意思是说：从毛泽东那里来的。孩子是这样，大人就不用说了。苏联人民简直和我们一样地关心着我们祖国的一切，关心着你们在朝鲜的英勇战斗。他们把中国人民的一切胜利看做自己的胜利。同志们，你们立的是国际功啊！当你们将来凯旋回国的时候，不仅毛主席会在天安门前检阅你们，看你们在天安门前威武地走过，向你们说：“同志们，辛苦了！”全世界爱好和平的人民都会向你们庆功，都会感激地向你们说：“同志们，辛苦了！”我们常想，你们有一天要是有谁来到莫斯科的话，苏联的人民该会怎么样地欢迎你们呀！
                        中国全体留苏学生
