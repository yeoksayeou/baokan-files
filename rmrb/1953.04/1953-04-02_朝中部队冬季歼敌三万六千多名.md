Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st - Our front-line reporter comments on the major victory of the Korean winter campaign: In the third winter of the Korean War, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies launched a more active and extensive campaign than in the winter of 1951. The brave soldiers of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies often climbed frozen icy mountains and snowy ridges in the freezing late nights, wiping out the enemy and achieving victory. By comparing this winter with the previous winter, it is clear that our army's fighting power has become stronger in the past year, and the blows to the enemy have become heavier and heavier.

From December of last year to February of this year, our army eliminated a total of 36,502 enemy soldiers and shot down or damaged 1,262 enemy aircraft during the winter campaign. The number of enemy soldiers eliminated this winter increased by nearly 10,000 compared to the previous winter, and the number of enemy aircraft shot down or damaged increased by 297.

A comparison of the operational situations in these two winters reveals that tremendous changes have taken place in the Korean War. This change illustrates how the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves is shifting and how the war situation is developing in our favor. In the winter of 1951, the enemy was almost constantly frantically attempting to break through our army's front line. At that time, our army resolutely resisted the enemy with tenacious blocking warfare, wiping them out before our own positions. However, by the winter of 1952, the number of enemy attacks had decreased by half compared to the previous winter, while the number of our army's proactive attacks to eliminate the enemy had increased by nearly three times. From December of the year before last to February of last year (i.e., the previous winter), the enemy launched 459 attacks. In the second half of December of the year before last alone, enemy battalion-sized attacks averaged more than five times per day, and the enemy's provocative attacks on the Chiryong-dong area northeast of Panmunjom around New Year's last year lasted for twelve days before they were forced to stop after suffering a crushing defeat. However, in the winter campaign from December of last year to February of this year, the enemy only launched 219 attacks, a decrease of 240 from the previous winter. There were only two battalion-sized enemy attacks throughout the winter, one of which was the so-called "T-shaped Hill assault" that the enemy had once clamored about, but which resulted in an extremely tragic failure.

Contrary to the relatively reduced number of enemy attacks, the number of proactive attacks by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies to eliminate the enemy has increased significantly. This winter, our army conducted more than 200 victorious raid battles, constantly wiping out enemy troops by platoons and companies.

The many outstanding raid and attack battles carried out by our army this winter fully demonstrate the great leap forward in the tactics and techniques of our army commanders and soldiers, as well as the power of our artillery. The enemy troops defending their positions were mostly wiped out when they encountered our army's attacks. Although the positions held by these annihilated enemy troops were built with quite solid fortifications: clusters of large and small bunkers, layers of trenches and barbed wire, and some positions were even built with tunnel works connected to communication trenches and shelters, these fortifications, painstakingly built by the enemy over more than a year, could not save the enemy from being wiped out.

The American aggressors are attempting to escape the heavy casualties inflicted on the U.S. military by the Korean and Chinese People's Forces through the vicious policy of "Asians fighting Asians." They are making efforts to expand the Rhee Syngman puppet army to act as cannon fodder for the U.S. military. In the winter of the year before last, the Rhee puppet army had ten divisions, responsible for the defense of one-half of the front line, and the U.S. military suffered 12,624 casualties in combat. By last winter, the American aggressors had scraped together four more Rhee puppet army divisions to send to the front, a total of fourteen divisions of the Rhee puppet army responsible for the defense of two-thirds of the front line. However, the U.S. military's casualties not only did not decrease, but increased. In this winter campaign, the U.S. military suffered 14,290 casualties, an increase of more than 1,600 compared to the previous winter.

From the previous winter to this winter, the enemy and ourselves have been taking completely different paths. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies are becoming stronger and stronger, moving from victory to greater victory. The invading forces, headed by U.S. imperialism, are going downhill year by year, moving from failure to greater failure. Although the enemy has tried their best to use all kinds of despicable and shameless means in an attempt to salvage their doomed fate, all efforts have been in vain. In the past year, the enemy has created a series of provocative incidents to sabotage the armistice negotiations, conducted a criminal bacteriological warfare, and carried out barbaric concentrated bombing raids on peaceful towns and villages in northern Korea. But the enemy has failed, their casualties are increasing, and their failures are becoming heavier and heavier.

### 朝中部队冬季歼敌三万六千多名

    朝中部队冬季歼敌三万六千多名
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】本社前线记者评述朝鲜冬季作战的重大胜利：在朝鲜战争的第三个冬季作战的日子里，朝中人民军队展开了比一九五一年冬季更积极和更广泛的战斗。朝中人民军队的勇士们经常在北风凛冽的深夜，登上封冻的冰山雪岭，歼灭敌人取得胜利。只要把这一个冬天，和上一个冬天比较一下，就可以清楚地看出在过去的一年中，我军战斗力量已经变得更加强大，给敌人的打击已愈来愈沉重。
    从去年十二月到今年二月，我军在冬季作战中共计歼灭敌军三万六千五百零二名，击落击伤敌机一千二百六十二架。这一个冬季歼灭敌军的数字比上一个冬季歼灭敌军的数字增加了近万名，击落击伤敌机的数字增加了二百九十七架。
    将这两个冬季的作战情况对比一下，更可以看出，朝鲜战况已发生了巨大的变化。这个变化说明了敌我力量的消长和战局是怎样向着对我有利的方面发展。在一九五一年冬季，敌人几乎是没有一天不在猖狂地向我军战线窜犯。那时，我军以顽强的阻击战坚决抗击敌人，把敌人歼灭在自己阵地之前。但是到了一九五二年的冬季，敌人窜犯的次数比上一个冬季减少了一半，而我军主动出击歼敌的次数却增加了将近三倍。前年十二月到去年二月（即上一个冬季），敌人窜犯次数达四百五十九次，仅前年十二月份的下半月成营敌军的窜犯平均每天在五次以上，并且敌人在去年新年前后向板门店东北智陵洞地区进行的挑衅性窜犯持续了十二天之久，直到遭受惨败之后才被迫停止。但是，在去年十二月到今年二月的冬季作战中，敌人窜犯的次数只有二百一十九次，较上一个冬季减少了二百四十次。在整个冬季中成营敌人的窜犯只有两次，其中一次就是敌人曾嚣张一时的所谓“丁字山突击战”，结果却遭到了极其悲惨的失败。
    与敌人窜犯次数相对减少的情况相反，朝中人民军队主动出击歼敌的次数大量增加。在这一个冬季，我军共进行了二百余次胜利的袭击战。不断地整排整连地歼灭敌军。
    我军在这一个冬季所进行的许多出色的袭击战和攻击战，充分表现了我军指挥员战斗员战术和技术的巨大的跃进和我军大炮的威力。据守阵地的敌军在遭遇我军攻击时大部都被全歼。尽管这些被歼灭的敌军所据守的阵地，都修筑了相当坚固的工事：大小地堡群，层层战壕和铁丝网，而且部分阵地上还筑有与交通沟和掩蔽部相连接的坑道工事。但是这些经过敌人一年多时间苦心修筑的工事，决不能挽救敌军被歼的命运。
    美国侵略者企图以“亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒政策来逃脱朝中人民部队给予美军的重大杀伤，他们努力扩充李承晚伪军来为美军当替死鬼。前年冬季李伪军有十个师，担负二分之一战线的防务，美军在战斗中伤亡了一万二千六百二十四名；到了去年冬季美国侵略者又拼凑起了四个李伪军师送到前线，一共有十四个师的李伪军担负了三分之二战线的防务，但是，美军的伤亡不但没有减少，而且增加了。在这个冬季作战中美军伤亡就有一万四千二百九十名，比上一个冬季增加了一千六百多人。
    从上一个冬季到这一个冬季，敌我双方走着完全不同的道路。朝中人民军队愈战愈强，从胜利走向更大的胜利；以美帝国主义为首的侵略军却一年不如一年地走着“下坡路”，从失败走到更大的失败。尽管敌人曾竭尽全力地使用各种卑鄙无耻的手段妄图挽救其失败的定局，但都归于无效。在过去的一年中，敌人曾制造了一连串破坏停战谈判的挑衅事件，进行了罪恶的细菌战，向朝鲜北部和平城乡居民进行了野蛮的重点轰炸，但是敌人失败了，他们的伤亡愈来愈增加，失败愈来愈沉重。
