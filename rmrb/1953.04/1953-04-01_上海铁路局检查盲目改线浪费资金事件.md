The Shanghai Railway Bureau recently investigated the incident of wasting 2.4 billion yuan of state funds due to the blind alteration of the railway line between Yao Huamen and Hepingmen in Nanjing last year. The investigation results were published in the "Shanghai Railway News" to educate all employees.

The 6.35-kilometer section of railway between Yao Huamen and Hepingmen in Nanjing had a relatively steep gradient (an average of 4.4 per thousand), making it difficult for locomotives to operate when hauling heavy loads. Before liberation, workers called it "Hell's Slope." After liberation, thanks to the workers' enthusiasm, the tonnage hauled continuously increased. By the winter before last, ordinary locomotives could pull 2,200 tons, and by last summer, this had increased to more than 2,400 tons, with advanced drivers pulling 2,700 tons. Based on the current transportation situation, there was no need to modify this section of the line.

However, Sun Baorong, the head of the Engineering Planning Section of the original Planning Department of the Shanghai Railway Bureau (now Deputy Director of the Engineering Department), wanted Shanghai Railway Bureau's facilities to be the "best in the country" to showcase his achievements. Coupled with the leadership of the Shanghai Railway Bureau having the intention of modifying the line, he firmly advocated for the modification. Without any investigation or research into the original line, and unaware of the fact that ordinary locomotives could already pull 2,200 tons, he solely relied on British and American theories. He calculated that the old line could only pull 2,100 tons, while the modified line could pull 2,400 tons. To illustrate the necessity of modification, he even cited some incorrect figures, claiming that the modification would save the country 8.4 billion yuan annually. Yan Fuchang, the head of the Planning Department, motivated by departmentalism and treating Sun Baorong's calculations with a bureaucratic attitude, failed to investigate the actual situation or consider it carefully, and thus agreed to the modification.

In April last year, workers created many new records for hauling more and running faster, and the tonnage pulled by locomotives generally increased. The bureau sent a team of eight technicians to Yao Huamen to investigate whether the modification project could be postponed. The investigation team returned and suggested that it should be postponed. However, Sun Baorong still blindly believed in British and American theories, expressing doubt about the creativity of the workers, believing that exceeding axle load to climb slopes had no "theoretical" basis. He also believed that if the modification plan was cancelled, the entire basic construction plan of the bureau for 1952 would have to be changed, which would be too troublesome. Therefore, he firmly refused to accept the investigation team's opinion and fabricated a set of reasons to persuade Yan Fuchang, the head of the Planning Department, and the leading cadres of the Shanghai Railway Bureau. The leaders of the Shanghai Railway Bureau and Yan Fuchang, dominated by the departmentalist idea that "modification is beneficial to the Shanghai Bureau and has no harm," also agreed to keep the modification plan unchanged.

The modification plan was sent to the Ministry of Railways, which initially disagreed. In May of last year, when the full-load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement was in full swing, locomotives were already generally pulling 2,400 tons on the old line. However, the bureau still sent Yan Fuchang and Sun Baorong to the Ministry of Railways to argue for it, claiming that the modification would save 8.4 billion yuan annually, and that the volume of winter transport would greatly increase, so the task could not be completed without modification. The Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways mistakenly overestimated the Shanghai Railway Bureau's transport volume for 1953, and therefore, the modification plan was approved by the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. The project officially started in September last year and was completed at the end of the year. During the construction process, due to a lack of ideological and technical leadership, and a lack of planning, the quality of the project was very poor. For example, one of the main projects of the modification - the two-kilometer-long drainage ditch - if you stamped your foot next to the ditch, the flagstones on both sides would collapse. Local farmers said, "This is not a ditch, it's tofu; it will be washed away by the water."

After spending 2.4 billion yuan of state funds and working hard to complete this modification project, what benefits did it bring to the country? According to calculations, it only shortened the running time by one minute compared to the original line, saving a little coal, and saving only 200 million yuan annually.

### 上海铁路局检查盲目改线浪费资金事件

    上海铁路局检查盲目改线浪费资金事件
    上海铁路局最近检查了因去年盲目改修南京尧化门与和平门之间线路，浪费国家资金二十四亿元的事件，并在“上海铁道报”上公布，以教育全局职工。
    南京尧化门与和平门之间长六点三五公里的一段铁路，由于坡度较大（平均千分之四点四），机车牵引较重后就不好运行。解放前，工人叫它“阎王坡”。解放后，由于工人发挥了积极性，牵引吨数不断增加。到前年冬季，一般机车都能拉两千二百吨，去年夏季增加到两千四百多吨，先进司机可拉两千七百吨。按目前的运输情况，这段线路是用不着改修了。
    但是上海铁路局原计划处工程计划科科长孙宝融（现任工程处副处长），希望上海铁路局各项设备成为“全国第一”，以表现自己的成绩，加上上海铁路局领导上曾有改线意图，他就坚决主张改修这条线。对原来的线路根本没有进行调查研究，当时一般机车已经拉到两千二百吨的事实也不知道，单凭英美的理论，他计算出在老线上只能拉两千一百吨，改线后可拉到两千四百吨。为了说明非改线不可，他还引用一些不正确的数字，认为改线后每年可为国家节省八十四亿元。计划处处长严福昌由于本位主义思想作怪，并以官僚主义态度来对待孙宝融的计算，没有调查实际情况，也没有慎重考虑，就同意了改线。
    去年四月，工人创造了许多多拉快跑的新纪录，机车拉的吨数普遍增加了。该局曾派八位技术人员组成小组，到尧化门去调查改线工程是不是可以缓做。调查小组回来，提出应当缓做。但是孙宝融仍然迷信英美理论，对工人群众的创造性表示怀疑，认为超轴爬坡是没有“理论”根据的。同时认为如果取消改线计划，路局一九五二年整个基本建设计划都要变更，太麻烦。因此，坚决不接受检查小组的意见，并编了一套理由来说服计划处处长严福昌和上海铁路局的领导干部。上海铁路局领导上和严福昌在“改线对上海局有利无害”的本位主义思想支配下，也同意了改线计划不变。
    改线计划送到铁道部，起初铁道部不同意。去年五月，当满载、超轴、五百公里运动轰轰烈烈展开的时候，在老线上，机车已普遍拉到两千四百吨。可是该局还派了严福昌、孙宝融等到铁道部力争。理由是改线后每年可节省八十四亿元；估计冬季运输量将大大增加，不改线完不成任务。铁道部运输局错误地把上海铁路局一九五三年运输量估计过高，因此，改线计划便被铁道部计划局批准了。这项工程在去年九月正式动工，年底完成。施工中，又由于缺乏思想领导和技术领导，缺乏计划性，因此工程质量很差。如改线中的主要工程之一——两公里长的水沟，如果走到沟旁一跺脚，两面的片石就塌下来，当地农民说：“这不是水沟，是豆腐，水一冲就稀烂了。”
    化了二十四亿元的国家资金，辛辛苦苦做了这个改线工程，到底对国家有多大利益呢？根据计算，只能比原线缩短一分钟的运行时间，可以节省一点煤，每年仅可节省二亿元。
