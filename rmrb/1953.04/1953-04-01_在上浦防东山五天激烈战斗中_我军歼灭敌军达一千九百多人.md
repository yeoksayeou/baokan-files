Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 31st: Our agency's Western Front reporter, Zhang Tao, reports: In the five days of fierce fighting from the 23rd to the 27th, our army has annihilated a total of more than 1,900 soldiers from the American 7th Division and the Colombian Army on Shangpu near Mt. Dong, northwest of Lianchuan – that is, on the mountain the American news agencies call "Old Baldy" and its surrounding hilltops. "Old Baldy" is a narrow, elongated mountain ridge extending from northwest to southeast, about one kilometer long, and is a commanding height on the enemy's forward positions. It is embedded between the enemy's main positions – Heights 346.6 and 287.2. Our army's capture of this position is like a sharp blade inserted into the enemy's heart, posing a serious threat to the enemy's line.

As far back as June to September of last year, our army attacked "Old Baldy" five times. The defending American 2nd Division and the American 45th Division suffered nearly 5,000 casualties in the battle for this hilltop. In late January of this year, soldiers of the American 7th Division, who had been battered and exhausted at the Battle of Shangganling, were sent to this graveyard, which had been devastated by artillery fire.

In the past six months, the enemy has heavily fortified "Old Baldy," which has an area of only one square kilometer. There are seven rows of barbed wire and nearly two hundred bunkers of various sizes. These bunkers are constructed with steel plates, sleepers, and steel frames, up to three or four meters thick. Each bunker is equipped with light and heavy weapons, and eight tanks constantly move up and down the mountain to defend against sudden attacks by our army.

Our army's sixth attack on the enemy on "Old Baldy" began in mid-March. At this time, the accumulated snow on the mountain ridges of the Western Front had completely melted, and coupled with continuous rainy days, the mud in the communication trenches of the forward positions was more than half a foot deep. Our soldiers braved the rain to repair bridges and roads, and transport ammunition and supplies; artillerymen stepped through the mud to move heavy artillery to new artillery positions. After the rain, the Yigu River suddenly swelled, and bridges were often washed away by the rapids or destroyed by enemy artillery fire. But the engineers built new bridges in one or two hours.

Before the battle began, the leaders of the troops presented the companies assigned to the attack with two red flags, demanding that the soldiers plant the red flags on the main peak of "Old Baldy." The soldiers solemnly swore before the portrait of Chairman Mao and the red flags: To welcome the third victorious spring since the beginning of the Korean War, and to win new honors for the motherland and for Chairman Mao. Every soldier solemnly wrote his name on the red flag.

On the night of the 23rd, the attack began. Our attacking troops launched a fierce attack on De Yin Dong North Mountain, 1,000 meters south of "Old Baldy," and Shi Xian Dong North Mountain, 1,500 meters north of "Old Baldy," completely annihilating a reinforced platoon of the Colombian battalion, the American 7th Division's 31st Regiment's 11th Company headquarters and two platoons, the 10th Company's one platoon, and more than 200 soldiers of the Li pseudo army. Subsequently, our army's artillery conducted a sustained seven-minute bombardment of "Old Baldy," and then two red flags of our attacking troops fluttered on the main peak. A reinforced company (the 2nd Company) of the Colombian battalion defending "Old Baldy" was completely annihilated by our forces.

In the battle, our soldiers displayed unparalleled bravery. Teng Mingguo and four other members of the Youth League, in order to reduce the time and casualties of the assault troops at the front, pressed their bodies on the barbed wire set up by the enemy to allow the assault troops to pass smoothly. Soldiers wounded in the charge shouted to their comrades: "Don't worry about me, advance! Eliminate the enemy!" Flag bearer Tian Shunhua was wounded, and Qin Zunqiu immediately took the red flag and continued to advance; when Qin Zunqiu fell, Zhang Tingxiao took the red flag again and finally planted it on the highest peak of "Old Baldy."

Our army's artillery played a huge role in this battle. The enemy's bunkers were all destroyed by our army's artillery fire. The four enemy tanks on the northeast slope of the main peak of "Old Baldy" did not have time to escape. The tank soldiers were so frightened that they trembled under the tanks, and the tanks became the soldiers' trophies.

From dawn on the 24th to noon on the 26th, the enemy, with forces ranging from one company to more than two battalions, repeatedly attacked the main peak of "Old Baldy" and the east slope of the main peak, which we had just occupied, with the support of a large number of tanks and artillery. The enemy used a total of more than five battalions. When the enemy had just assembled or rushed to a considerable distance, the artillery shells fired by our army fell like hail on the enemy ranks, blowing the enemy to pieces. The fiercest fighting was on the 24th, when the enemy fired more than 45,000 shells and dropped more than 150 bombs on this hilltop. However, the brave soldiers of our army skillfully evaded the enemy's artillery fire in the communication trenches, covered in mud, and they repulsed the enemy's charges, and then bravely counterattacked. The mountain was covered with the corpses of enemy soldiers wearing helmets and nylon flak jackets.

In these two and a half days alone, more than 1,300 soldiers of the American 7th Division were killed or wounded. Together with the results of the 23rd and 27th, our army has annihilated more than 1,900 enemy soldiers. Since noon on the 25th, the enemy, who had been badly defeated by our army, had no choice but to send a large number of aircraft and use a large amount of artillery fire to bombard this small hilltop wildly, except for using small units to harass and attack at dawn or dusk. They vainly attempted to use shells, bombs, and incendiary bombs to accomplish what their soldiers could not accomplish. In the two days of the 26th and 27th alone, the enemy dispatched 143 sorties of aircraft and used six artillery battalions, dropping 429 bombs and firing more than 21,000 shells at this small hilltop. However, this kind of indiscriminate bombing by the enemy, even the commander of the US Air Force's Fifth Air Force in Korea, Bax himself, had to admit sadly: "It looks like the mountain was bombed so that the ground was turned over," but it could not "make the army recover the hilltop," "We don't yet have weapons that can hit some of the enemy's tunnels" (United Press). Our soldiers in the solid shelters they built laughed at the enemy and said: "This time the enemy has found a good target, they are bombing the corpses of American soldiers!" At the same time, our heroic defenders also launched anti-aircraft fire with various high-altitude weapons, and in these few days, they have shot down three enemy planes and wounded three enemy planes, one of which fell right in front of the "Old Baldy" position.

    在上浦防东山五天激烈战斗中
    我军歼灭敌军达一千九百多人
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】本社西线记者张涛报道：在二十三日到二十七日五天激烈的战斗中，我军已在涟川西北上浦防东山——即美国通讯社所称的“老秃山”及其附近的山头上，歼灭美军第七师及哥伦比亚军共一千九百多人。 “老秃山”是一条由西北向东南伸延，长约一公里的狭长形山岭，是敌军前沿阵地的一个制高点。它嵌在敌军主阵地——三四六点六和二八七点二两个高地之间。我军攻占了这一阵地，就像插入敌心脏的利刃一样，对敌军阵线是一个严重的威胁。
    远在去年六月到九月期间，我军就曾经五次攻打“老秃山”，那时的守军美二师、美四十五师在这座山头的争夺战中，被我军杀伤近五千人。今年一月下旬，在上甘岭战场被打得焦头烂额的美七师的士兵，又被送到这座被炮火轰得寸草不存的坟场上来。
    近半年中，敌人在这座仅一平方公里面积的“老秃山”上大力加修了工事。有铁丝网七道，大小地堡近二百个。这些地堡都是用钢板、枕木、钢骨筑成的，厚达三四公尺。每个地堡都有轻重火器配备，并经常有八辆坦克在山上山下游动，以防御我军突然的打击。
    我军对“老秃山”敌军的第六次打击，是在三月中旬开始的。这时，西线山岭上的积雪已完全溶化，加上连日阴雨，前沿阵地交通沟里的泥浆有半尺多深。我军战士们冒雨修桥补路，运送弹药物资；炮兵们踏着泥浆把重炮搬到新的炮阵地。雨后，驿谷川河水突涨，桥梁常被急流冲垮或被敌炮轰断。但工兵们在一二小时内，又搭好了新的桥梁。
    战斗发起以前，部队首长送给担任攻击任务的连队两面红旗，要求战士们把红旗插在“老秃山”主峰上。战士们在毛主席像和红旗前庄严宣誓：迎接朝鲜战争开始后的第三个胜利的春天，为祖国、为毛主席争取新的荣誉。每一个战士并在红旗上郑重地写上了自己的名字。
    二十三日夜，攻击开始。我军攻击部队分两路猛扑“老秃山”以南一千公尺的德隐洞北山及“老秃山”以北一千五百公尺的石岘洞北山，全歼哥伦比亚营一个加强排及美七师三十一团十一连连部和两个排、十连一个排、及李伪军等二百多名。接着，我军大炮向“老秃山”进行了持续七分钟的猛轰，随后我军攻击部队的两面红旗即飘扬在主峰上。守在“老秃山”上的哥伦比亚营一个加强连（第二连）被我全部歼灭。
    在战斗中，我军战士表现了无比的英勇。滕明国等四个青年团员，为了使突击部队在前沿少停留、少伤亡，曾经把身体压在敌人设置的铁丝网上，让突击部队顺利通过。在冲锋时负伤的战士，向他们的战友喊：“不要管我，前进！消灭敌人！”红旗手田顺华负了伤，覃尊秋马上接过红旗继续前进；覃尊秋倒了，张廷孝又接过红旗，终于把它插上了“老秃山”的最高峰。
    我军炮兵在这次战斗中发挥了巨大的威力。敌人的地堡都被我军大炮打塌了，“老秃山”主峰东北山岗上的四辆敌军坦克也没来得及逃掉，坦克手吓得钻在坦克下面发抖，坦克成了战士们的胜利品。
    自二十四日拂晓到二十六日中午，敌人以一个连到两个多营的兵力，在大量坦克和大炮的配合下，轮番向我刚刚占领的“老秃山”主峰及主峰东山岗猛扑。敌人先后动用的兵力约五个多营。当敌人刚刚集结，或冲到相当距离时，我军大炮发射的炮弹像冰雹一般落在敌群内，炸得敌人血肉横飞。战斗最激烈的是二十四日，敌人向这座山头上发射了四万五千多发炮弹，投炸弹一百五十多枚。但是，英勇的我军战士在交通沟中巧妙地避开敌人的炮火，浑身沾满了泥，他们打垮敌人的冲锋，接着又奋勇出击。山上山下到处躺满了戴着钢盔、穿着尼龙避弹衣的敌军尸体。
    单在这两天半时间内，美七师被打死打伤的就有一千三百多人。连同二十三日及二十七日的战果加在一起，我军已歼灭敌军一千九百多人。自二十五日中午以后，被我军打得惨败的敌人除了在拂晓或黄昏用小部队扰乱袭击以外，只好派大批飞机并用大量炮火对这座小山头狂轰滥炸，他们妄想用炮弹、炸弹和燃烧弹来完成他们的士兵所不能完成的事。仅在二十六、二十七日两天，敌人就出动飞机一百四十三架次，使用了六个炮兵营，向这座小山头投弹四百二十九枚，发射炮弹两万一千多发。但是，敌人的这种狂轰滥炸，就连侵朝美空军第五航空队司令巴克斯自己也不得不悲哀地供认：“看起来山上炸得像地皮翻过来的样子”可是却不能“使陆军收复山头”，“我们还没有可以击中敌人某些坑道的武器”（合众社）。我军战士们在自己修筑的坚固的隐蔽部里嘲笑敌人说：“这回敌人可找到好目标啦，炸的都是美国兵的死尸！”同时，我英勇的守军还用各种高射武器展开对空射击，在这几天中他们已经打落敌机三架，打伤敌机三架，其中一架正落在“老秃山”阵地前沿。
