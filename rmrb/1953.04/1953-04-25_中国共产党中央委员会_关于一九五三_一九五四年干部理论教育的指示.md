    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Instructions on Cadre Theoretical Education for 1953-1954
    (April 23, 1953)

    1.  In order to meet the needs of the whole Party entering the period of economic construction, it is now stipulated that the senior and intermediate groups of the Party's cadre theoretical study will study Chapters 9 to 12 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and a part of Lenin and Stalin's works on socialist economic construction for a year and a half from July 1953 to December 1954. This study plan requires all major cadres of the Party to systematically understand the basic laws of the Soviet Union in realizing national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and completing socialist construction, so as to correctly utilize the Soviet Union's experience in the process of our country's economic construction based on China's specific conditions. At the same time, this study plan requires all cadres of the Party to improve their study habits, enhance their theoretical interest, so as to prepare for further study of Marxist-Leninist theory, especially the study of political economy.
    2.  In the process of studying Chapters 9 to 12 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", the senior group should study the following works of Lenin, Stalin, and others chapter by chapter: Chapter 9: 1. Lenin: Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat 2. Lenin: On the Unified Economic Plan 3. Lenin: On the Food Tax 4. Lenin: On Cooperation 5. Stalin: The Soviet Union's Internal Situation and Conclusion in the Summary Report on the Central Political Work at the 14th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) Chapter 10: 6. Stalin: On the Soviet Economic Situation and the Party's Policy 7. Stalin: Part 2 of the Summary Report on the Central Political Work at the 15th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) 8. Kuibyshev: Speech on the First Five-Year Plan at the 15th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) 9. Instructions of the 15th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) on the Formulation of the Five-Year Plan for the National Economy 10. Stalin: On the Grain Front 11. Stalin: Lenin and the Question of Alliance with the Middle Peasants 12. Stalin: On the Right Deviation within the CPSU (Bolsheviks) 13. Stalin: The Year of the Great Turn Chapter 11: 14. Stalin: On Several Questions of Soviet Land Policy 15. Stalin: Dizzy with Success 16. Stalin: Part 2 and Part 3 of the Summary Report on the Central Work at the 16th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) 17. Stalin: On the Tasks of Economic Workers 18. Stalin: New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction 19. Stalin: Summary of the First Five-Year Plan 20. Stalin: Part 2 and Part 3 of the Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) at the 17th Party Congress 21. Molotov: Tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan Chapter 12: 22. Stalin: Speech at the Graduation Ceremony of Students of the Red Army Academy in the Kremlin 23. Stalin: Speech at the First All-Union Stakhanovite Workers Conference 24. Stalin: Part 2 and Part 3 of the Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) at the 18th Party Congress 25. Molotov: On the Third Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet National Economy 26. Malenkov: On the Tasks of Party Organizations in Industry and Transportation. The intermediate group should study eight articles, namely, the fifth, seventh, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fourth.

    The above-listed documents may be appropriately increased or decreased when necessary. Various departments may select and read a part of other relevant documents according to the needs of the cadres' own work.
    3.  When carrying out the above study plan, appropriate literature on the Chinese economy should be referred to (the content of which will be determined separately). In order to strengthen the learning effect, all localities must organize senior cadres to make reports on the current economic situation, economic work situation, and the Party's policies and guidelines in our country based on the Party Central Committee's consistent instructions.
    4.  The time for theoretical study (including reading, lectures, and group discussions) is stipulated to be four to six hours per week. The learning method of the senior group is mainly self-study, and the learning method of the intermediate group is in principle mainly lectures. Study discussion meetings should be led and prepared, and the number of participants and the number of sessions should not be too many. The number of sessions should generally be once every two weeks. In the process of studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the senior study groups in various agencies have mostly adopted the method of designating two study times per week, two to three hours each time, during which no other activities are carried out (such as, during working hours, work is taken care of by those on duty). Although this method has its shortcomings, it is still relatively effective and feasible at present under the conditions of lack of spare-time political schools and theoretical teachers, and should be continued. However, the theoretical study time for cadres in factories and mines should be determined separately by the Party committees to which the enterprises belong according to the specific situation.
    5.  In addition to theoretical study, all Party cadres must study the Party's policies. The policy study time is stipulated to be an average of two hours per week, and can generally be carried out on Party Day (spare time at the disposal of the Party branch). In order to avoid the shortcomings of too much or too little, sometimes loose and sometimes tight, disorganized, repetitive, unrealistic, and ineffective in policy study, it is stipulated that all policy studies will be formulated by the provincial (municipal) Party committees in the future under the guidance of the central government or the central bureau in principle, based on the specific conditions of the region, and formulate the monthly study plan for the region.
    6.  The primary group study plan shall be formulated by each province (city) according to needs and possibilities, and approved by each central bureau. Those with a cultural level (mainly referring to the level of language) less than junior high school graduation are generally mainly engaged in cultural studies, and at the same time, planned and appropriately coordinate the study of policy documents and theoretical knowledge.

    The cultural study of worker-peasant cadres with a cultural level below junior high school graduation is a major issue, and all localities must earnestly strengthen the leadership of the cultural study of personnel in organs. The Central Propaganda Department should quickly cooperate with the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government to study the leadership, school system, teaching materials, staffing, funding, and other issues of the cultural study of organ staff and rural work cadres, and make appropriate decisions.
    7.  In order to enable the theoretical study and policy study of cadres at all levels to be conducted in a guided manner, it is necessary to focus on solving the problem of theoretical teachers. The central government, central bureaus, and provincial (municipal) party committees must first hold short-term training courses for full-time and part-time theoretical teachers to guide the study of middle and elementary groups. The plan will be jointly formulated at the central level by the Central Propaganda Department, the Central Direct Party Committee, and the Government Party Committee, and formulated by the central bureaus in the central bureaus and provinces (cities). Since the establishment of theoretical teachers is just beginning, the requirements for them should not be too high at present. As long as they can study diligently, work hard, give correct explanations of the learning materials, and answer the questions raised by the learners to the best of their ability and with caution, they should be rewarded. Full-time theoretical teachers should be managed by the propaganda departments of party committees at all levels, and can also be sent to work in spare-time political schools or study rooms.

    Party committees above the provincial (municipal) level should hold spare-time political schools (or spare-time party schools) according to plan. According to the experience of Shenyang, Tangshan, and other places, after the establishment of cadre spare-time political schools, the theoretical study of intermediate and primary groups can be carried out in an organized and planned manner, and the learning effect has been significantly improved. To run this kind of school well, it must have the attention and support of the party committee, it must have a certain number of teachers (including full-time teachers and part-time teachers) and counselors, and it must establish a professional organization to manage teaching affairs and administrative work.

    The propaganda departments of many provincial (municipal) party committees have established study rooms as specialized organs for study counseling, which are very popular with learners. This method should be promoted in all party committees above the provincial (municipal) level.

    Full-time teachers, full-time cadres of spare-time party schools, and cadres of study rooms should be included in the formal establishment of party committee organs (the establishment will be stipulated separately).
    8.  In order to ensure the sound progress of learning, regular examinations are an effective method. Examinations can take the form of quizzes, question-and-answer sessions, and writing papers. In the process of studying Chapters 9 to 12 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", examinations can be held once after the end of each chapter. In the entire learning process, each senior study group should write at least one paper that can be published in newspapers and periodicals.
    9.  The classification of study should become a step towards implementing the academic year system. In the past, some places had a bias in viewing the classification as a political treatment, and inappropriately raised or lowered the classification of some cadres. This prevented the learning from achieving its due effect. Before starting the study of Chapters 9 to 12 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", all localities should adjust the classification appropriately in a realistic manner by taking examinations or other methods.

    At present, cadres participating in theoretical study in county-level organs can generally not be classified because the number of people in each county is small, that is, they all participate in the study of the primary group. However, exceptions can be made when the provincial party committee agrees.
    10. This instruction is only applicable to general cadres of Party organs, government organs, economic organs, and leading organs of mass organizations. Except for the theoretical study of cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has been separately stipulated by the General Political Department, the theoretical study of other technicians, teachers, doctors, art workers, cadres in ethnic minority areas, etc., should be stipulated separately by the relevant leading organs.

    中国共产党中央委员会
    关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示
    （一九五三年四月二十三日）
    一、为了适应全党在进入经济建设时期的需要，现在规定全党干部理论学习的高级组和中级组在一九五三年七月到一九五四年十二月的一年半时间内，都学习“联共（布）党史”第九章到第十二章和列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设的一部分著作。这个学习计划，要求全党主要干部都能有系统地了解苏联实现国家工业化、农业合作化和完成社会主义建设的基本规律，以便在我国经济建设过程中根据我国具体条件正确地利用苏联的经验。同时，这个学习计划要求全党干部健全学习生活，提高理论兴趣，以便为进一步学习马克思列宁主义理论特别是学习政治经济学作好准备。
    二、高级组在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章到第十二章的过程中，应逐章研读列宁、斯大林等人的下列著作：第九章：1，列宁：无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治2，列宁：论统一经济计划3，列宁：论粮食税4，列宁：论合作制5，斯大林：在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上关于中央政治工作的

   划的发言9，联共（布）第十五次代表大会关于拟定国民经济五年计划的指示10，斯大林：在粮食战线上11，斯大林：列宁与联合中农问题12，斯大林：论联共（布）党内的右倾13，斯大林：大转变的一年第十一章：14，斯大林：论苏联土地政策的几个问题15，斯大林：胜利冲昏头脑16，斯大林：在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上关于中央工作的总结
    报告第二部分和第三部分17，斯大林：论经济工作人员的任务18，斯大林：新的环境和新的经济建设任务19，斯大林：第一个五年计划的总结20，斯大林：在第十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总

    大会上的演说23，斯大林：在第一次全苏联斯大哈诺夫工作者会议上的演说24，斯大林：在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总
    结报告第二部分和第三部分25，莫洛托夫：关于发展苏联国民经济的第三个五年计划26，马林科夫：关于党组织在工业和运输中的任务中级组应研读第五、
    、七、十六、十七、十八、十九、二十、二十四等八篇。
    以上所列的文件，必要时可作适当的增减。各部门可按干部本身业务需要选读一部分其他的有关的文件。
    三、在进行上述学习计划时，应参考适当的关于中国经济的文献（其内容另定）。为加强学习效果，各地必须组织高级干部根据党中央历来指示作有关目前我国经济状况、经济工作状况和党的政策方针的报告。
    四、理论学习时间（包括阅读、上课和小组讨论）规定为每周四小时至六小时。高级组的学习方法以自学为主，中级组的学习方法在原则上以上课为主。学习讨论会应有领导有准备，参加人数和举行次数都不应过多，次数一般以两星期一次为宜。在学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件过程中，各地机关中的高级学习组多已采用每星期指定两次学习时间，每次二小时至三小时，在此时间内不作其他活动（如在工作时间内，由值班者照顾工作）的办法。这个办法虽然有它的缺点，但在目前业余政治学校和理论教员缺乏的条件下，暂时还是比较有效的和可行的，应该继续坚持。但厂矿企业中的干部理论学习时间，则应由企业所属党委根据具体情况另行规定。
    五、除理论学习外，全党干部都必须学习党的政策。政策学习的时间规定为平均每周二小时，一般可在党日（由党支部支配的业余时间）进行。为了避免政策学习上的过多过少、忽松忽紧、零乱、重复、不合实际、不见实效等缺点，规定政策学习今后一律由省（市）委在中央或中央局原则指导下，依据本区具体情况，制定本区每月的学习计划。
    六、初级组学习计划由各省（市）按照需要和可能自行规定，由各中央局批准。凡文化程度（主要指语文程度）不到初中毕业者，一般以学习文化为主，同时有计划地、适当地配合学习政策文件和理论常识。
    文化程度不到初中毕业的工农干部的文化学习是一个重大问题，各地必须认真加强对于机关工作人员文化学习的领导。中央宣传部应迅速协同中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会研究机关工作人员和农村工作干部文化学习的领导、学制、教材、编制、经费等问题，并作出适当的决定。
    七、为使各级干部的理论学习和政策学习能够有指导地进行，必须着重解决理论教员问题。中央、各中央局、各省（市）委必须首先举办指导中、初级组学习的专职和兼职的理论教员短期训练班，其计划在中央一级由中央宣传部、中直党委和政府党委共同制定，在中央局和各省（市）由各中央局制定。由于理论教员还是开始设立，目前对他们的要求不应过高。只要能够用功学习，努力工作，对学习材料能够作正确的讲解，对学习者提出的问题能够尽其所能作谨慎的解答者，即应予以奖励。专职的理论教员应由各级党委的宣传部管理，亦可派入业余政治学校或学习室工作。
    各省（市）以上党委，应有计划地举办业余政治学校（或业余党校）。根据沈阳、唐山等地的经验，干部业余政治学校建立以后，中级组、初级组的理论学习就能有组织、有计划地进行，学习效果有显著的提高。要办好这种学校，必须有党委的重视和支持，必须有一定数量的教员（包括专职教员和兼职教员）和辅导员，必须设立管理教务和行政工作的专业机构。
    许多省（市）党委的宣传部建立了学习室，作为学习辅导的专门机关，很受学习者的欢迎。这个方法，应在一切省（市）以上党委推广。
    专职教员、业余党校的专职干部和学习室的干部应列入党委机关的正式编制之内（其编制另行规定）。
    八、为了保证学习的健全的进行，定期的考试证明是一个有效的方法。考试可采取测验、答问、写论文等形式。在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章的过程中，考试可在每章学习结束后举行一次。在全部学习过程中，每个高级学习组至少应写一篇可以在报刊上发表的论文。
    九、学习的编级应当成为过渡到实行学年制的步骤。过去有些地方有把编级看成政治待遇的偏向，不适当地把某些干部的编级提高或压低了。这就使学习不能收到应有的效果。各地在开始“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章的学习前，应实事求是地采取考试或其他方法把编级做一次适当的调整。
    目前各县级机关参加理论学习的干部，由于每县人数较少，一般可不分级，即一律参加初级组的学习。但在省委同意时可以作例外的规定。
    十、本指示只适用于党的机关、政府机关、经济机关和群众团体领导机关的一般干部。除中国人民解放军干部理论学习已由总政治部另行规定外，其他技术人员、教员、医生、艺术工作者、少数民族区干部等的理论学习问题，应由有关领导机关另作规定。
