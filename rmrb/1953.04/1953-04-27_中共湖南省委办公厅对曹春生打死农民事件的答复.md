    中共湖南省委办公厅对曹春生打死农民事件的答复
    编者按：一月十八日本报第三版刊载了“湖南省安化县区干部曹春生恶霸作风严重，竟违法乱纪打死农民王宏开和王振家”事件的报道，及二月四日本报“读者来信”栏刊载了读者对该事件的意见后，中共安化县委会曾对此事件作了书面检讨，中共湖南省委办公厅也给本报来信说明这事件的处理经过。现把省委办公厅来信摘要发表如下。
    中共湖南省委办公厅来信：这事本发生在去年六月三日。安化县县长熊邵安、县法院院长张本源、县公安局局长刘云乔和县民政科科长等曾经先后去当地作了善后工作。去年八月初，中共湖南省委纪律检查委员会接到该事件的有关材料后，即配合湖南省人民检察署、省人民法院组成工作组，前往当地调查，并把调查结果报告了中共中央中南局。去年十月里，省委又特为该事件召开了专门会议，根据中南局的指示，对该事件的处理作了决定，且报经中南局批准。今年一月下旬，由常德专署副专员赵玉和安化县县长熊邵安等亲赴该乡召开全乡群众大会，并有附近各区乡代表参加，组成临时人民法庭作最后处理。会上由县长熊邵安、中共第三区区委书记杨峰云、中共第五区区委前副书记张鹤松等检讨后，宣布该事有关人员的处分：主犯曹春生判处死刑，立即执行；第五区前副区长王智堂开除党籍，行政上撤职，判处徒刑两年；陈王乡代理乡长王忠爱、马路村代理农民协会主任王柱祥，行政上都撤职，并各判处徒刑一年；陈王乡民兵中队长陈同生行政上撤职；中共第五区区委前副书记张鹤松党内撤销工作；中共第三区区委书记杨峰云党内警告。中共湖南省委还指示所属各地党组织领导全体干部对这事件展开讨论，并联系检查自己的思想和工作作风。
