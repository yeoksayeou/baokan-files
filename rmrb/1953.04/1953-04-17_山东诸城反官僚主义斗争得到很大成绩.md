The Zhucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province, starting from August of last year, began by handling letters from the people and seriously dealt with several cases of violations of law and discipline. Later, it also emphasized convening people's representative conferences and cadre meetings at all levels, fully promoted democracy within and outside the Party, conducted self-criticism from top to bottom, and launched criticism from bottom to top, thereby effectively rectifying the work style of cadres. In arranging the winter work, county-level leaders also paid attention to explaining policies and working methods, diligently inspected, and regularly sent people to the countryside to specifically help district and township cadres overcome difficulties. Currently, the work style of cadres has undergone significant changes, coercive orders have been greatly reduced, the phenomenon of beating people has been eliminated, the democratic atmosphere in rural areas has been greatly enhanced, and the political enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly increased, thereby powerfully promoting various winter tasks.

Zhucheng County's struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline has the following experiences:

First, conscientiously inspect and handle letters from the people, and
	vigorously handle several typical cases

Prior to August of last year, the Zhucheng County Committee's understanding of the severity of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in the county was insufficient. Due to the existence of serious paralysis, when the Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee sent people to Zhucheng to inspect and handle letters from the people, the responsible cadres of the County Committee actually said: "There are no letters from the people." After a preliminary investigation, 41 letters from the people were found. During a general inspection in October, another 500 letters from the people were found, and many serious problems were discovered, including 10 letters that had been backlogged for more than a year and 3 accusing cadres of driving people to death. At this time, the County Committee also felt the problem was serious and tightened its grip on handling letters from the people. By mid-February of this year, 80 percent of all letters had been processed. Through handling letters from the people, a total of 79 people, including village cadres, were punished. In the process, in addition to educating cadres who had made general mistakes and making them examine and correct themselves, the focus was on serious cases of violations of law and discipline. The county organized forces to fully investigate the situation, make accurate conclusions, and then deal with them vigorously at people's representative conferences or cadre meetings. This had a great effect on improving cadres, changing their work style, and mobilizing the masses to supervise cadres. Zhucheng County handled six cases of violations of law and discipline in district and township cadre conferences, people's representative meetings, and representative meetings of youth, women, militia, and propagandists, and in cooperative mutual aid training classes. The bad cadre Shi Wensheng, who raped women, beat and scolded the masses, and acted like a local tyrant, was brought to justice. At the People's Representative Conference, the suggestion of representatives was accepted, and the Township Party Branch Secretary Qiao Maosheng and village cadre Xie Jinshun of Penqu Township in the Fifteenth District, who raped women and beat demobilized soldiers, were dealt with. The representatives immediately shouted "Long live the Communist Party!" Some were moved to tears. After various representative meetings, the representatives conducted extensive publicity among the masses, and the morale of the masses was greatly boosted. They reflected: "With the Communist Party and the People's Government, bad people are not allowed to do evil." Letters from the people also increased sharply because they were handled correctly. In the two months of November and December of last year, county-level organs received 700 letters from the people and 120 letters of thanks from the masses, and districts received more than 3,000 letters from the people. Through the handling of typical cases, cadres' indignation at bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline was further aroused. At the same time, they understood the Party's policies, dispelled cadres' concerns, and enhanced cadres' enthusiasm for the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

Second, in conjunction with inspection and deployment of work, members of the
	County Committee took the lead in conducting self-criticism from top to bottom and mobilized cadres to launch criticism from bottom to top

At the cadre meetings, the Zhucheng County Committee, through summarizing work, conducted concrete and in-depth self-criticism of bureaucracy in the leadership of the County Committee. Using concrete examples, it focused on explaining that the County Committee did not understand the situation at lower levels, the deployment of work did not proceed from reality, the work guidance was not specific, and it did not pay attention to clearing up thoughts and explaining policies and methods, assigning quotas, setting deadlines, and other mistakes. It pointed out that this was an important root cause of district and township cadres' coercive orders, destruction of policies, and separation from the masses. Under the influence of the County Committee's sincere self-criticism, district and township cadres improved their thinking. On the one hand, they had the courage to criticize the leadership of the County Committee, and on the other hand, they consciously examined their own mistakes and expressed their determination to correct them. The organization member of Zhiguo District said after listening to the County Committee's self-criticism: "If I don't make a self-criticism, I'll be letting the Party down." While criticizing the leadership of the County Committee, many criticisms were also made of the various departments at the county level, which greatly helped the various departments improve their work. The responsible cadres of some departments said: "I originally thought there was nothing to inspect, but I didn't expect the problem to be so serious." Some said: "In the past, I thought these problems were nothing, but I didn't expect it to have such a bad influence." The various departments also consciously conducted self-criticism and stated: "We can't make such mistakes again in the future." After criticizing commandism, cadres actively requested to be introduced to concrete methods of doing a good job. At this time, the County Committee selected cadres with democratic work styles who had achieved success in following the mass line to introduce their experiences and praise them, setting up role models and educating cadres, which had a great effect.

Third, conscientiously hold county and township people's representative
	conferences, fully promote democracy, and launch a mass-based bottom-up criticism movement

At the county people's representative conference, which exercised the functions of the People's Congress at the end of December last year, the responsible cadres of the county reported on the work, conscientiously examined the shortcomings and errors in the work, and mobilized the representatives present to criticize. Many representatives sharply criticized the bureaucracy in the county-level leadership and exposed the coercive command style of district and township cadres. Farmer representative Yan Shiliang pointed to the secretary of the County Committee and the county head and said: "If coercive orders and violations of law and discipline occur below, you will be responsible. If you don't examine and correct yourselves, we won't elect you." The former county head, Li Huazheng, made a self-criticism at the meeting and expressed his determination to correct himself. District Head Wu Zhenhui had consistently committed serious coercive command style and did not accept criticism. But this time, after being criticized by the representatives, he made a self-criticism and said: "I have never received such a profound education." The conference also dealt with and answered 1,525 proposals separately, dealt with bad cadres, democratically elected the county head, and studied and deployed the current work. The morale of the representatives was unprecedentedly high. After the representatives returned, they first publicized to the masses how democracy was practiced at the conference and told the masses: "If anyone doesn't practice democracy in the future, you can file a complaint." As a result, the democratic thinking of the broad masses was greatly enhanced. Each township held two to four people's representative meetings in the winter. District and township cadres conducted more in-depth self-criticism by summarizing work, conscientiously handled proposals, and combined them with handling letters from the people. Some townships also conducted elections, and the masses would not elect cadres who had committed serious mistakes and violators of law and discipline. As a result, the democratic atmosphere in rural areas was greatly enhanced, and all work proceeded more smoothly than before. The number of proposals at the People's Representative Conference has greatly increased compared to before. The county People's Representative Conference held at the end of December last year received 1,525 proposals, while the number of proposals at the county People's Representative Conference held in mid-February this year increased sharply to 3,500. Because the county and township people's representative conferences effectively solved the problems raised by the masses, letters from the people decreased day by day. The county received more than 3,700 letters from the people in November and December of last year, while it received only more than 400 letters from the people in January and February of this year. However, the quality of the letters has improved, and their content mainly involves leadership issues in counties and districts.

Fourth, effectively improve the leadership style of the County Committee and
	specifically help district and township cadres study work methods and solve practical difficulties

When deploying winter work, the Zhucheng County Committee implemented the spirit of opposing bureaucracy, conscientiously studied the instructions from higher authorities, paid attention to proceeding from reality, adhered to the principle of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," and strengthened inspection work. At the winter cadre meeting, the County Committee summarized production, conducted education on the situation and tasks, so that cadres consciously accepted the tasks, and repeatedly explained the policies before putting forward tasks, figures, and deadlines, allowing cadres in each district to fully discuss them. Then the County Committee formulated plans based on the different situations in each district. This corrected the past bias of not conducting education conscientiously, not humbly listening to the opinions of lower levels, and forcibly assigning tasks. The meeting took two days to study the specific methods for districts and townships to carry out their work. Each district specifically studied the practices of one township, and the County Committee selected typical examples, introduced them at the meeting, and mobilized everyone to discuss and revise them, serving as a reference for local areas to formulate plans. Through these measures, cadres in districts and townships established confidence in completing the tasks correctly. After the winter work was deployed, the County Committee organized forces to go to the countryside to inspect work 11 times, with a cumulative total of 489 cadres going to the countryside. In the inspection work, many important problems were discovered and solved. For example, the work in the northern urban area was lagging behind, and the morale of cadres was not high. The inspection team found that Wang Yuhuai, the township head of Wanli Township in the district, had a democratic work style and followed the mass line in his work. He was immediately praised at the district and township cadre meeting, which improved the working confidence and enthusiasm of the cadres in the district. The Jin Dun district was seriously affected by the disaster, and the district committee did not pay attention to production and disaster relief work. After the inspection team reported to the County Committee, the County Committee clearly instructed the district to focus on production and disaster relief work and suggested that the county government send the deputy county head to the district to provide specific assistance. In the process of reorganizing mutual aid and cooperation in some villages in Taiping district, the inspection team found that there was a bias towards impatience and merging into large groups. The county leadership immediately convened the leaders of the large groups to the county for a meeting, educated them, and corrected them. Because the county leadership paid attention to improving leadership methods, district and township cadres not only did not have negative emotions and were afraid to work after the anti-commandism campaign, but also improved their confidence, gradually learned the working methods of the mass line, and victoriously promoted and completed the various winter tasks.

    山东诸城反官僚主义斗争得到很大成绩
    中共山东诸城县委，从去年八月份起，就从处理人民来信入手，严肃地处理了几个违法乱纪的案件。以后又注重召开了各级人民代表会议和干部会议，充分发扬了党内外民主，进行了自上而下的检讨，开展了自下而上的批评，从而有效地整顿了干部的作风。在布置冬季各项工作中，县级领导又注意了交代政策和工作方法，并勤于检查，经常派人下乡具体帮助区乡干部克服困难。目前，干部作风已有显著的转变，强迫命令的行为亦大大减少，打人的现象已经绝迹，农村中的民主风气大大增强，群众的政治积极性大为提高，从而有力地推动了冬季的各项工作。
    诸城县反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争有下列几点经验：
    第一、认真检查与处理人民来信，并大张旗鼓地
        处理几个典型案件
    去年八月以前，诸城县委对该县官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪情况的严重性认识很不够；由于存在严重的麻痹思想，当胶州地委派人去诸城检查处理人民来信工作时，县委会的负责干部竟说：“没有人民来信”。经初步调查，就找出了人民来信四十一件；十月份普遍检查时，又找出了人民来信五百件，并发现了许多严重的问题；其中有积压一年以上的来信十件，控告干部逼死人命的三件。这时县委也感到问题严重，才抓紧了处理人民来信工作。至今年二月中旬，已处理全部来信的百分之八十。通过处理人民来信，连村干部在内计处分了七十九人。处理中除对犯有一般错误的干部，进行教育使之检讨改正外，着重抓住严重的违法乱纪事件，由县组织力量，全面查清情况，做出准确结论，然后在人民代表会或干部会上大张旗鼓地加以处理。这样，对提高干部、转变作风和发动群众监督干部的作用很大。诸城县曾在区、乡干部大会、人民代表会议及青年、妇女、民兵、宣传员代表会议上和合作互助训练班中，处理了违法乱纪案件六起，法办了强奸妇女、打骂群众、称王称霸的坏干部石文升；在人民代表会议上接受代表的提议，处理了十五区盆渠乡奸污妇女、殴打转业军人的乡支部书记乔茂盛、村干部谢金顺，代表即高呼“共产党万岁！”有的感动得流了眼泪。经过各种代表会议以后，代表们在群众中进行了广泛的宣传，群众情绪大为振奋，纷纷反映：“有共产党和人民政府，就不允许坏人作恶。”人民来信也因得到了正确的处理而剧增；以去年十一、十二两个月来说，县级机关收到人民来信七百件，收到群众感谢信一百二十件，各区收到人民来信三千余件。通过典型案件的处理，更激起了干部对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象的义愤；同时了解了党的政策，解除了干部的顾虑，提高了干部反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争的积极性。
    第二、结合检查与布置工作，县委委员带头，自上
        而下进行检讨，发动干部自下而上展开批评
    诸城县委在干部会议上，通过总结工作，具体、深刻地检讨了县委领导方面的官僚主义，用具体的例子，着重说明了县委不了解下情、布置工作不从实际出发，工作指导不具体，不注意打通思想和交代政策、做法，摊派数字，限期完成等等错误；并指出这是造成区、乡干部强迫命令、破坏政策、脱离群众的重要根源。区、乡干部在县委诚恳自我批评的带动影响下，思想有了提高，一方面有勇气批评县委的领导，一方面又自觉地检讨了本身的错误，表示决心改正。枳沟区组织委员听了县委检讨后说：“我再不检讨，就对不起党了。”在批评县委领导的同时，对县级各部门也提出了很多批评，对各部门改进工作帮助很大。有的部门负责干部说：“原来以为没什么可以检查，没想到问题竟这么严重。”有的说：“过去以为这些问题算不了什么，没想到会造成这样坏的影响。”各部门也纷纷自觉地进行了检讨，并表示：“今后再不能犯这样的错误了。”在批判命令主义之后，干部又积极要求介绍做好工作的具体方法；这时，县委即选择作风民主，走群众路线有成绩的干部，进行介绍和表扬，树立榜样，教育干部，作用很大。
    第三、认真开好县、乡人民代表会议，充分发扬
        民主，开展群众性的自下而上的批评运动
    去年十二月底，诸城县召开代行人民代表大会职权的县人民代表会议上，县负责干部报告了工作，认真检查了工作中的缺点和错误，发动到会的代表进行批评；很多代表尖锐地批评了县级领导方面的官僚主义，揭发了区、乡干部的强迫命令作风。农民代表阎世良，指着县委书记、县长说：“下边发生强迫命令、违法乱纪现象，就要你们负责任，不检讨改正，俺就不选你。”原县长李华政在会议上作了检讨，并表示决心改正。区长吴振辉，一贯犯有严重的强迫命令作风，且不接受批评；但这次受到代表们的批评后，他做了检讨，并说：“我从来没受过这样深刻的教育。”会上并分别处理与解答了一千五百二十五件提案，处理了坏干部，民主选举了县长，研究和部署了当前的工作，代表情绪空前高涨。代表回去后，首先向群众宣传了会上如何实行民主，并告诉群众说：“今后谁不讲民主，可以告状。”因而广大群众民主思想大为提高。冬季各乡都开过两次到四次人民代表会议，区、乡干部通过总结工作进行了较深刻的检讨，认真处理了提案，结合处理了人民来信；部分乡还进行了选举，犯有严重错误的干部和违法乱纪分子群众就不选他；因而农村民主空气大为增强，一切工作的进行都较前顺利了。人民代表会上的提案较前大有增加，去年十二月底召开的县人民代表会收到提案一千五百二十五件，而今年二月中旬召开的县人民代表会提案激增到三千五百件。由于县、乡人民代表会切实地解决了群众提出的问题，因而人民来信日有减少，去年十一、十二两个月全县收到人民来信三千七百多件，而今年一、二两月份合计只收到人民来信四百多件；但来信的质量提高了，其内容主要是涉及县、区的领导问题为多。
    第四、切实改善县委的领导作风，具体帮助区、
        乡干部研究工作方法，解决实际困难
    诸城县委在布置冬季工作时，即贯彻了反对官僚主义的精神，认真研究了上级指示，注意从实际出发，坚持了从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线的原则，加强了检查工作。去冬干部会议上，县委总结了生产，进行了形势和任务的教育，使干部自觉地接受任务，并反复地交代了政策，才提出任务、数字和期限，让各区干部充分讨论，而后县委再根据各区不同的情况制订出计划；这就纠正了过去不认真进行教育，不虚心听取下级意见，硬行摊派任务的偏向。会议上拿出两天时间研究了区、乡进行工作的具体方法，各区具体研究一个乡的做法，县委选择典型，在大会上介绍，发动大家讨论修正，作为各地制订计划的参考。通过这些措施，区、乡干部都树立了正确完成任务的信心。冬季工作布置之后，县委组织力量下乡检查工作十一次，累计下乡干部达四百八十九人次。在检查工作中发现与解决了许多重要问题，如城北区工作落后，干部情绪不高，检查组发现该区万里乡乡长王玉怀，作风民主，工作上走群众路线，当即在区乡干部会议上进行了表扬，提高了该区干部的工作信心和积极性。金墪区灾荒严重，区委对生产救灾工作不重视，经检查组报告县委后，县委即明确指示该区以生产救灾为中心工作，并建议县政府派副县长去该区具体帮助。太平区部分乡村整理互助合作工作中，检查组发现有急躁冒进并大组的偏向后，县领导方面即召集大组组长到县开会，进行教育后加以纠正。由于县领导方面注意了改善领导方法，所以在反命令主义后，区乡干部不仅没有发生消极情绪和不敢工作的偏向，而且提高了信心，逐渐学会了群众路线的工作方法，胜利地推动与完成了冬季各项工作。
