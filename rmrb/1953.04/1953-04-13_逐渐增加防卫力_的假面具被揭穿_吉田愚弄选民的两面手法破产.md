Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: Under the strong pressure of the Japanese people's resolute opposition to rearmament, the Yoshida Liberal Party, which has consistently been actively involved in rearmament, is once again brushing up its old signboard of so-called "gradually increasing defense capability," attempting to ease popular opposition and deceive voters in the general election in order to maintain its ruling position. However, Yoshida's two-faced tactics have been exposed by his own actions.

After the Liberal Party used the slogan of "gradually increasing defense capability" to deceive some voters in the October 1, 1952 general election and continued to hold power, the Yoshida government immediately took a series of actions that showed it was an active pursuer of rearmament. Less than half a month after the general election, on October 15, Yoshida reorganized the 110,000-strong "Police Reserve Force," which he called the "backbone of the new national army," into the "Security Force," and merged it with the "Maritime Safety Force," which originally belonged to the "Maritime Safety Agency," under the direct jurisdiction of the disguised military department, the "Security Agency," as an organizational preparation for the revival of the Japanese war machine. Kyodo News openly admitted: "The new National Security Force and Maritime Safety Force are undertaking more important military tasks than the previous Police Reserve Force and Maritime Safety Agency," and "it will become the core of the future army and navy."

While Yoshida was full of denials of rearmament, he was secretly plotting how to further rearm. The Japanese economic newspaper "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" revealed: the Yoshida government formulated two rearmament plans, one of which was the "Godo Plan" personally drafted by former Minister of International Trade and Industry, Takao Godo. This plan was to establish an army of 15 divisions and 290,000 men, a navy with a total of 300,000 tons of ships, and an air force with 2,800 aircraft within three years. At the end of November 1952, Yoshida sent his confidant, Jiro Shirasu, chairman of Tohoku Electric Power, to Washington as a special envoy of the Prime Minister with the title of ambassador, to discuss Japan's rearmament plan with the US government.

The budget案 for the 1953 fiscal year submitted by Yoshida to the now-dissolved Diet further exposed the deceptive nature of his so-called "gradually increasing defense capability." The "Security Agency" expenses increased sharply from 59 billion yen to 83 billion yen, and other military expenses included 62 billion yen allocated to the US occupation forces and 50 billion yen for old soldiers' allowances. With nearly 100 billion yen of "slush funds" buried from previous fiscal years, Yoshida could fully expand the "Security Force" from the current 110,000 to 180,000 in 1953 according to the US plan.

In order to obtain US aid to accelerate rearmament, Yoshida finally did not hesitate to take off his mask of "gradually increasing defense capability." Just a few days before the Diet passed a vote of no confidence in the Yoshida government—on March 9th, Yoshida openly told the Diet: "Japan can accept the US's request for rearmament if this request is beneficial to Japan." Agence France-Presse quoted Tokyo "well-informed sources" as saying that Yoshida's unscrupulous exposure of his fox tail "was to satisfy the Americans before the (US) Congress voted on the appropriations for the Mutual Security Agency," because "he is still hoping to obtain financial benefits, especially loans and investments, as an exchange condition for rearmament."

Now, as the Yoshida Liberal Party is about to face the Japanese voters again, Yoshida is hurriedly rolling up the fox's tail he just revealed, and singing the tune of "gradually increasing defense capability" and "not rearming" to fool the voters again. However, lies cannot cover up the facts. Murphy, the US ambassador to Japan, who was recently transferred back to the country, inadvertently revealed Yoshida's secrets when he spoke about Japan's rearmament issue in Hong Kong on the 8th, saying: "Because promoting Japan's rearmament is related to the general election, it cannot be explained in detail. As far as the United States is concerned, it is vigorously providing assistance to promote rearmament."

### “逐渐增加防卫力”的假面具被揭穿  吉田愚弄选民的两面手法破产

    “逐渐增加防卫力”的假面具被揭穿
    吉田愚弄选民的两面手法破产
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：在日本人民坚决反对重整军备的强大压力下，一贯积极在重整军备的吉田自由党又在粉刷它的所谓“逐渐增加防卫力”的旧招牌，企图缓和人民的反对，在大选中骗取选票，好继续保持它的统治地位。然而吉田这种两面的手法已经被他自己的实际行动所揭穿。
    当自由党在一九五二年十月一日的大选中用“逐渐增加防卫力”的口号骗得了一些选票而继续当政之后，自由党的吉田政府马上就以一系列的行动表明了自己是重整军备的积极追求者。就在大选过后不到半个月的十月十五日，吉田把被他称为“新国军骨干”的十一万名“警察后备队”改编成为“保安队”，连同原来属于“海上保安厅”的“海上警备队”一并归并于变相的军部“保安厅”的直辖之下，作为复活日本战争机器的组织准备。共同社曾公开承认：“新的国家保安队和海上警备队较以前的警察后备队和海上保安厅担负了更重要的军事任务”，“它将成为未来陆军和海军的核心”。
    在吉田满口否认重整军备的同时，他暗中却在积极策划着如何进一步重整军备。日本经济界的报纸
    “日本经济新闻”透露：吉田政府拟订了两个重整军备的计划，其中一个是吉田亲自邀请前通商产业相伍堂卓雄草拟的“伍堂计划”。这个计划准备在三年内建立十五师、二十九万人的陆军，共有舰只三十万吨的海军和拥有飞机二千八百架的空军。吉田并在一九五二年十一月底派了他的亲信、日本东北电力会会长白洲次郎以大使衔首相特使的资格去华盛顿和美国政府商谈日本重整军备的计划。
    吉田向现在已被解散的这次国会提出的一九五三会计年度的预算案更进一步地暴露了他所谓“逐渐增加防卫力”的欺骗性质。“保安厅”经费从五百九十亿日元急剧增加到八百三十亿日元，其他军事费用还有拨给美国占领军的六百二十亿日元和旧军人的津贴五百亿日元等，加上从以前的会计年度埋伏下来的近一千亿日元的“黑款”，足足可以供吉田在一九五三年内照着美国的计划将“保安队”从现在的十一万人扩充到十八万人。
    为了要取得美国的援助以便加速度地进行重整军备，吉田最后甚至不惜脱下了他“逐渐增加防卫力”的假面具。就在国会通过对吉田政府的不信任案的前几天——三月九日，吉田公开向国会说：“日本可以接受美国提出的重整军备的要求，如果这个要求对日本有利的话。”法新社援引东京“消息灵通人士”的话说：吉田这样不惜露出狐狸尾巴，“是为了在（美国）国会表决共同安全署的拨款前满足美国人的意见”，因为“他仍在盼望得到财政上的利益，尤其是贷款和投资，作为重整军备的交换条件”。
    现在，当吉田自由党又要在日本选民面前过关的时候，吉田急忙把他刚刚露出了的狐狸尾巴卷藏起来，又唱出了“逐渐增加防卫力”和“不重整军备”的调子来愚弄选民。但是，谎言是掩盖不了事实的。最近调职返国的美国驻日大使墨菲于八日在香港就日本重整军备问题发表谈话时，不慎地泄露了吉田的底细说：“因为促进日本重整军备和大选有关，所以不能详细说明。在美国来说，正在大力援助，以促进重整军备。”
