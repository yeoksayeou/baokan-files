Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 8th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communiqué on April 8th:

    The third meeting of the liaison groups from both sides was held at Panmunjom at 11:00 a.m. on April 8th.

    At the meeting, General Li Sang-cho, head of our side's liaison group, informed the other side that our estimated number of sick and wounded prisoners of war to be directly repatriated is approximately 600. Among them, approximately 450 are Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war, and approximately 150 are non-Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war. The other side informed our side that their estimated number of sick and wounded prisoners of war to be directly repatriated is approximately 5,800. Among them, approximately 5,100 are Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war, and approximately 700 are Chinese sick and wounded prisoners of war.

    At the same meeting, both sides agreed to limit the discussions between the heads of the liaison groups from both sides to major issues, and to appoint some officers to resolve the administrative details of the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Both sides also agreed that, in order to reach an agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, so that the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war can begin as early as practically possible, the officers' meeting should be held immediately after the liaison group meeting on April 8th.

    Regarding the specific arrangements for the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, General Li Sang-cho suggested at the April 8th meeting that, in order to maintain order in the Panmunjom meeting area, the maximum number of military police from each side in the meeting area should be increased from the current 15 to 30 during the period when sick and wounded prisoners of war are being repatriated through the meeting area. The other side agreed to this.

    Regarding the principle proposed by the other side of guaranteeing the maximum protection of sick and wounded prisoners of war from both sides during this repatriation, General Li Sang-cho expressed his agreement. However, based on the actual situation, our side put forward some revised opinions on the specific methods proposed by the other side. The other side expressed its willingness to consider our opinions.

    The fourth meeting of the liaison groups from both sides is scheduled to be held at 11:00 a.m. on April 9th. In the afternoon of April 8th, both sides appointed officers to hold the first officers' meeting. The officers appointed by our side were Colonel Li Ping-yi of the Korean People's Army and Colonel Wang Jian of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The officers appointed by the other side were Colonel Carrock, Colonel Cairns, and Colonel Li Shu-rong.

    At the officers' meeting, both sides discussed the administrative details of the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Paris Humanitarian News reporter, Betz, reported from Panmunjom on the 8th: Progress continued this morning in the negotiation tent at Panmunjom. The Korean-Chinese side suggested repatriating about 600 sick and wounded prisoners of war, of which 150 were foreign sick and wounded prisoners of war, including British and American personnel. The U.S. side suggested repatriating 700 Chinese and 5,100 Koreans, for a total of 5,800. The number 600 provides a stark contrast, because UN prisoners of war detained by the Korean-Chinese side have always received good treatment. Furthermore, according to the U.S. side's own very incomplete figures, as well as reports by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the U.S. side had killed or wounded more than 3,000 prisoners of war in Geoje Island and other prisoner-of-war camps by the beginning of March of this year.

    General Li Sang-cho, head of the Korean-Chinese liaison group, agreed this morning to transfer the remaining administrative arrangements for the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war to staff members for resolution. Both sides agreed to establish new meeting tents in the meeting area as venues for resolving these issues. The time for the first staff meeting will be decided at the afternoon meeting. Colonel Li Ping-yi will lead the Korean-Chinese side's team, and Colonel Carrock will lead the U.S. side's team.

    At this morning's meeting, General Li Sang-cho said that he suggested proposing revised provisions to the U.S. draft agreement on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, regarding the clause on providing protection to sick and wounded prisoners of war in transit.

    朝鲜谈判续开联络组会议
    双方通知准备直接遣返病伤战俘的概数并指定军官举行会议讨论遣返行政细节
    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月八日发表公报如下：
    双方联络组第三次会议于四月八日上午十一时在板门店举行。
    会上，我方联络组组长李相朝将军通知对方，我方准备直接遣返的病伤战俘的估计数字是六百人左右。其中朝鲜籍病伤战俘四百五十人左右，非朝鲜籍病伤战俘一百五十人左右。对方则通知我方，对方准备直接遣返的病伤战俘的估计数字是五千八百人左右。其中朝鲜籍病伤战俘约五千一百人，中国籍病伤战俘约七百人。
    同日会上双方同意：把双方联络组组长之间的讨论，限于主要问题，而指定一些军官来解决遣返病伤战俘的行政细节。双方并同意：为了达成遣返病伤战俘的协议，俾能在实际情况许可下，尽早开始遣返病伤战俘，军官会议应在四月八日联络组会议后立即举行。
    关于遣返病伤战俘的具体安排问题，李相朝将军在四月八日的会上建议：为了维持板门店会场区的秩序，在病伤战俘经由会场区被遣返期间，会场区内的各方军事警察的最高限额应自目前的十五名增至三十名。对方对此表示同意。
    对于对方所提出的保证双方病伤战俘在这次遣返期间受到最大限度的保护的原则，李相朝将军表示同意。但我方根据实际的情况，对于对方所提出的具体办法，提出了若干修正的意见。对方表示愿考虑我方的意见。
    双方联络组第四次会议定在四月九日上午十一时举行。在四月八日下午，双方指定军官举行第一次军官会议，我方所指定的军官，是朝鲜人民军李平一上校及中国人民志愿军王健上校。对方指定的军官是卡洛克上校、凯恩斯上校与李树荣上校。
    在军官会议上，双方就遣返病伤战俘的行政细节进行了讨论。 【新华社八日讯】巴黎人道报记者贝却敌八日自板门店报道：今晨在板门店谈判帐篷中继续获得进展。朝中方面建议遣返约六百名病伤战俘，其中有一百五十名是包括英国人和美国人在内的外籍病伤战俘。美方建议遣返七百名中国人、五千一百名朝鲜人，共计遣返五千八百人。六百人这个数字成了很鲜明的对比，因为朝中方面拘留的联合国军战俘一贯受到良好的待遇。并且根据美方自己所发表的很不完全的数字以及红十字国际委员会的报告，到本年三月初为止，美方在巨济岛和其他战俘营打死、打伤了三千多名战俘。
    朝中联络组组长李相朝将军今晨同意把其余有关交换病伤战俘的行政方面的安排问题移交工作人员解决。双方同意在会场区建立新的会议帐篷作为解决这些问题的场所。第一次工作人员会议的时间将在下午的会议上决定。李平一上校将率领朝中方面小组，卡洛克上校将率领美方小组。
    在今晨会议上，李相朝将军说，他建议对美方关于交换病伤战俘的协议草案中的对输送中的病伤战俘给予保护的条款，提出修正条文。
