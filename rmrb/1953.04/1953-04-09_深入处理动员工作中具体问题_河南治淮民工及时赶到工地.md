    Deeply Address Specific Problems in Mobilization Work:
    Henan's Huai River Workers Arrive at Construction Site on Time
    In this spring's mobilization of Huai River workers, the Henan Provincial Huai River Headquarters strengthened the political work among the workers and helped them solve specific difficulties in production and life. As a result, 630,000 Huai River workers in the province have arrived at the construction site on time.
    This spring, the Henan Provincial Huai River Headquarters held a special meeting on the work of Huai River workers, at which it reviewed the shortcomings of insufficient in-depth investigation and research and insufficient concern for the suffering of the workers in the past mobilization of workers. Later, Zhang Jianguang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Henan Provincial Huai River Headquarters, led more than 50 cadres to various places to assist in the mobilization of workers. Leading comrades of various counties involved in mobilizing workers, such as Yu Qingyi, Deputy Secretary of the Yancheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, also went deep into the countryside to deal with various specific problems in the mobilization of workers. This year, cadres and farmers in various parts of the province who did not participate in the Huai River project signed contracts with the workers going to the Huai River to ensure that both the Huai River project and production would not be delayed. Some villages have also established support committees for the Huai River project to regularly supervise and inspect the implementation of the contracts. In addition, the wages, work shed, and tool subsidies for the workers have also been appropriately increased this year.

    深入处理动员工作中具体问题
    河南治淮民工及时赶到工地
    河南省治淮总指挥部在今年春季动员治淮民工中，加强了民工的政治工作，帮助民工解决了生产、生活中的具体困难问题。因而该省的六十三万治淮民工已及时地赶到工地。
    今春，河南省治淮总指挥曾为治淮民工工作专门召开过一次会议，会上对过去动员民工中不深入调查研究、关心民工疾苦不够的缺点作了检讨。以后，河南省治淮总指挥部政治部副主任张剑光又率领了五十多个干部，到各地协助民工动员工作。有关动员民工的各县领导同志，如中共郾城县委副书记余庆义等，也曾深入乡村处理动员民工中的各种具体问题。今年该省各地未参加治淮的干部和农民，都和去治淮的民工订立了保证治淮、生产两不误的合同。有的乡还建立了支援治淮委员会，经常督促和检查合同的执行情况。此外，今年民工的工资和工棚、工具等补助费，也已作了适当的提高。
