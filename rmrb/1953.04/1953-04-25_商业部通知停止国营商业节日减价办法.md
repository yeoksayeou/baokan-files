Xinhua News Agency, April 24th. The Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government has issued a notice to cease the State-owned commercial holiday price reduction measures. The full text is as follows:

    In the past, when prices were unstable, illegal merchants often took the opportunity to raise prices during holidays, harming the interests of the people. In order to stabilize the market, oppose speculation, and protect the interests of the people, the former Ministry of Trade decided that retail institutions of state-owned commerce across the country should implement holiday price reduction measures. Now that national prices have stabilized, and local industrial and commercial administrative management agencies are able to effectively manage holiday market prices, this method is no longer necessary. Moreover, since price stabilization, multiple holiday price reductions per year have caused artificial seasonal changes in the supply and demand relationship of commodities, hindering normal commodity circulation. In addition, state-owned commerce has not been established in some small cities and vast rural areas. Therefore, only a small number of residents in large and medium-sized cities actually enjoy the benefits of holiday price reductions. Many residents in small cities and the vast number of farmers have not received the preferential treatment of holiday price reductions. Therefore, this method of treating urban and rural people differently from a price policy perspective should not continue to be implemented in the future. Accordingly, it is hereby notified to cease the implementation of holiday price reductions by state-owned commerce. Therefore, price reductions will be stopped on the "May 1st" Labor Day. Please ask Party and government organs and people's organizations at all levels to conduct publicity and explanation to local residents.

    商业部通知停止国营商业节日减价办法
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府商业部通知停止国营商业节日减价办法，全文如下：
    过去在物价不稳定的时候，每逢节日，不法商人往往趁机抬价，侵害人民利益。为了稳定市场，反对投机，保护人民利益，前中央贸易部曾决定全国各地国营商业的零售机构执行节日减价的办法。现全国物价已经稳定，各地工商行政管理机关已能对节日市场价格进行有效的管理，故此种办法已无继续执行的必要。且自物价稳定以来，一年多次的节日减价，使商品的供求关系发生人为的季节变化，反而妨害了正常的商品流转。加以国营商业在有些小城市与广大农村并未设置，因此实际享受到节日减价利益的，只是一小部分大、中城市居民，许多小城市的居民和广大农民并未受到节日减价的优待，因此，这种从价格政策上对城乡人民待遇不同的办法，在今后也不宜继续实行。据此，特通知停止执行国营商业在节日减价的办法。因此，“五一”劳动节即停止减价，并请各地党、政机关和人民团体向当地居民进行宣传解释。
