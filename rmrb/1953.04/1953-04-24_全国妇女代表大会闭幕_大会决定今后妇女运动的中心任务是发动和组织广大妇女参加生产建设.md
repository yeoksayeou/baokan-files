Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Second National Women's Congress of China victoriously concluded on the 23rd, after eight days of meetings.

The greatest achievement of this congress was: on the basis of summarizing the women's movement of the past four years, and in accordance with the current tasks of national construction, the tasks of the women's movement in the future were determined. The congress believes that: in the past four years, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, and through the joint efforts of the broad masses of women and women cadres, the women's movement has achieved great success and has basically realized the equality of women with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. In view of the fact that our country has entered a period of construction, the congress decided that: the central task of the women's movement in the future is to mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to actively participate in industrial and agricultural production and the construction of all aspects of the motherland. The congress believes that: the active participation of the broad masses of women in labor production is conducive to the development of the motherland's construction cause, and can further improve the status of women in the family and society. The representatives who attended the meeting used their own personal experiences to specifically and vividly illustrate this issue. The congress believes that: democratic women's federations at all levels should take necessary steps and various methods suitable to the conditions at the time and place to mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to participate in industrial, agricultural and other production undertakings. At the same time, they should also mobilize women to participate in the general election movement, cultural education, maternal and child health, and childcare undertakings, so that they revolve around production and serve production. The congress called on women across the country to continue to strive for victory in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and to actively participate in the international women's peace and democratic movement.

Before the closing of the congress, Zhang Yun, Secretary-General of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, made an important comprehensive speech to the congress. Her speech enabled the representatives to further clarify their understanding of the tasks, methods, and experiences of the women's movement during the period of national construction.

Amidst warm applause, the congress unanimously adopted the resolution on Vice-Chairman Deng Yingchao's "Basic Summary of the Chinese Women's Movement in the Past Four Years and Report on Future Tasks," passed the revised Constitution of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and elected Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Shi Liang, Zhang Yun, and other one hundred and twenty-five people as members of the Second Executive Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and twenty-eight alternate members. The congress also elected Cai Chang, Li Dequan, and other thirty people as representatives of the Chinese women's delegation to the World Women's Congress.

At the closing of the congress, Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, spoke at the meeting. After explaining the relationship between the workers' movement and the women's movement, Lai Ruoyu called on female workers and female staff members to take the lead in the women's movement, and hoped that the families of workers and staff members would take it as their glorious task to do a good job in household affairs, care for workers and staff members, and encourage them to complete production tasks, and strengthen their studies to improve their political and cultural level, in preparation for participating in the construction of the motherland at any time when the motherland needs them. In his speech, Liao Chengzhi pointed out that the significant achievements made by Chinese women in the past four years show that Chinese women will certainly be able to continue to participate more actively and diligently in the great construction cause of the motherland under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government.

The congress passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, and all the representatives stood up, with applause lasting for a long time. The congress also passed telegrams of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Women's International Democratic Federation.

Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered the closing speech to the congress. She said: Now our congress is officially closed. The congress has victoriously completed its scheduled tasks and has become a good start for the women's movement in our country to embark on a new stage. All of our representatives must unite the masses of women more widely and work hard to realize the resolutions of the congress. When we return to our localities and work posts, we must use all opportunities at any time and place, and in accordance with the actual conditions at the time and place, to publicize and implement the resolutions of the congress, so that the resolutions of the congress become the actual actions of the masses, and promote the cause of national construction forward! Promote the cause of women's liberation forward!
