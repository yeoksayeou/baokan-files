Lessons from Design Errors of the No. 8 Blast Furnace Weighing Car
Sun Kaifan, Engineer, Weighing Car Project Designer, Angang Design Institute, Technician Fan Yuxia

The weighing car is one of the main transportation tools for blast furnaces. It looks somewhat like a railway flatcar, carrying two material cans weighing twenty-five tons each. The weighing car has two special devices: one is that when the car reaches the inclined bridge of the hoist, the device on the car will lift the material cans, which are then hoisted to the top of the furnace by the hoist. In addition, there is a weighing scale on the car, which can accurately show the weight of the ore loaded in the material cans. If the blast furnace charges an average of 160 times a day, then the weighing car has to run back and forth every nine minutes. Without it, the blast furnace cannot produce.

The No. 8 Blast Furnace of Angang needed three weighing cars, which were originally ordered from abroad, and it was thought that the order had arrived early. However, when the boxes were opened three months before the furnace was started, it was discovered that what had been shipped was a weighbridge and not a weighing car. In order not to affect the furnace start-up plan, the company decided to quickly repair the two old weighing cars of No. 9 Blast Furnace for initial use. A committee composed of five units was formed to oversee this work.

Thus, our design began.

Regarding the lifting speed of the can, the opinion on-site was that lifting 150mm should take ten seconds, while the preliminary design of the iron and steel plant made for us by the Soviet Union stipulated six seconds. However, we subjectively believed that the faster the better, and determined it to be 1.5 seconds. At such a high speed, what could have been done with 30 horsepower required 140 horsepower. But the motor we designed was still only 30 horsepower.

Under the labor-saving leverage of the old car, a force of 14 tons could lift a weight of 25 tons. In order to increase the lifting height of the can by three times, we adopted a simple method of moving the fulcrum of the lever, turning the labor-saving lever into a labor-intensive lever. It would take 42.5 tons of force to lift a weight of 25 tons, which is obviously unreasonable. As the force increased, the entire assembly also increased. However, with only 120mm of space left on the old car body, a 350mm wide bearing was added. The bearing was too large, so its ears were cut off, and large notches were dug into the channel steel of the eight main beams.

The weighing car made according to this design could not even lift an empty can during the first test run. Even if the test run were successful, the main beam would break within a month.

The result was: the deadline for completion was delayed by as much as four months. If the foreign order had not arrived in time, it would have seriously affected the timely start-up of the blast furnace. The original plan was to invest 1.2 billion yuan, but in reality, 1.5 billion yuan was wasted. Now these two weighing cars are lying in the repair shop like two corpses, and it has been half a year.

The reason for these serious design errors and waste is that we neither learned from advanced Soviet experience nor accepted the opinions of the masses, and our sense of responsibility was not strong.

We had no experience in designing weighing cars. When we first received the task, we knew that there were 82 old drawings of weighing cars left over from the puppet Manchuria in the drawing library, so we copied this set of designs like drawing a gourd according to the model. We thought, "Since the Japanese already have drawings, they can't be wrong."

At that time, a new Soviet weighing car and its complete set of design drawings arrived. The new Soviet car also used 30 horsepower to lift 150mm, but the device used by the Soviet Union was not a cam and lever, but an advanced sector gear transmission. With this basis, the error should have been corrected in principle, but we only spent less than half a day "studying" these materials. After hastily flipping through them, we roughly concluded that "the advanced Soviet technology is not applicable to our actual situation." Despite the advanced Soviet technical data being at our fingertips, we were still reluctant to abandon the old Japanese drawings, believing that this was the technical "magic weapon" and "reliance."

The facts powerfully demonstrate that it is entirely possible to apply Soviet experience to the old car. Two young technicians, Xu Fugen and Li Guangchun, who graduated last summer, took the initiative to go to the site for investigation and research for a few days after learning about this, and successfully applied the principle of the Soviet sector gear to our old car. Due to the adoption of sector gear transmission, a 30-horsepower motor can lift a 25-ton weight 150mm in six seconds, meeting the requirements stipulated in the Soviet preliminary design. The sketch of this design was praised by Soviet experts.

Refusing to learn from advanced Soviet experience is the first reason for our design errors.

As long as we could humbly listen to the opinions of the workers, this error could have been corrected. Before and after the first test run, the workers raised fourteen major opinions on the design. Experienced workers had foreseen all the errors in our design. But what attitude did we take towards these opinions?

Our attitude was: sometimes when the error had already been exposed, we tried hard to "explain" it away, in order to make fewer changes and avoid hurting our "face." For example, when the cam was designed unreasonably and the workers put forward specific improvement suggestions, we said, "It doesn't matter if it's a little off, let's just leave it like that!"

In more cases, we often used some "theoretical" basis to block the workers' mouths. A worker named Liang said: "Lifting a can is like a person carrying rice, you can't just bend over and lift it up, but you have to steady yourself and take it slowly." Meaning that if the speed is not reduced, the horsepower is not enough, and he put forward specific methods. This opinion was very good, but we pulled out a large sheet of calculation formulas and stuffed it in front of him, thinking that this would shut him up. In fact, this calculation was wrong, and the horsepower was miscalculated by three times.

We neither had rich practical production knowledge nor were willing to humbly listen to the opinions of the workers. One engineer said that the workers' opinions were "blind men divining fortunes," and some thought that the workers' opinions were "making a fuss" and "finding fault." After the second test run rework, we subjectively believed that there was no problem with this design, so we used a retaliatory attitude to say to the workers: "If there is a problem, it must be a problem with your installation!" Forcing the error of the bearing design onto the workers.

Another reason for this error is our irresponsible work attitude. The chief designer was unhappy to accept this task from the beginning. After taking it over, he handed it over to Engineer Sun Kaifan, and from then on he didn't ask any questions. Sun Kaifan hated repairing broken cars. Therefore, he took the task with his right hand and handed it over to two technicians with his left hand. The design leader regarded the design task as a burden, holding the attitude of "as long as it's made, it counts" and "once the drawings leave the door, everything is fine." Therefore, when someone suggested that the lifting speed of the can was too fast and a limit switch should be added, the design leader said: "This provision was not in the original division of labor contract of the committee, we don't care." Clearly, there were serious errors in the design, but we treated the headache by treating the head and supplemented the loopholes. We never thought of doing a comprehensive consideration and inspection of the entire design, so the key to the design error was not discovered for a long time.

We were also extremely unserious about technical basis. For example, without investigating and studying the original data, we actually used hearsay materials as a basis. When surveying and mapping the car body, we subjectively assumed that the two cars were completely the same, and assumed that each car was completely symmetrical, so we only measured half of one car. As a result, errors were caused in the design. In terms of technical theory, we even disliked using scientific calculations to determine the problem, but hastily decided based on inspiration (such as the issue of the lifting speed of the can).

In addition, the lack of an overall design concept, dividing the overall weighing car into separate designs, and not actively communicating with each other, also caused many omissions and the bad consequences of incompatibility between parts.

Through the review of the weighing car design ideas, we have more clearly realized the great harm of capitalist technical ideas. If we do not undergo arduous ideological transformation, we will not be able to do a good job in design work, and it will bring serious losses to the country. The large-scale construction of our motherland has already begun. Through this ideological construction movement, we have all clearly realized the importance and glory of our tasks. In the future, we must seriously study politics, learn advanced Soviet technology, and humbly ask Soviet experts for advice. We believe that we will definitely be able to do our work better in the future.

    八号高炉称量车设计错误的教训
    鞍钢设计处称量车工程设计人工程师  孙开藩  技术员  范玉侠
    称量车是高炉的主要运输工具之一。它的外形有些像铁路平板车，车上载着二十五吨重的两只料罐。称量车有两种特殊装置，一是当车开到卷扬斜桥口时，车上的装置会将料罐抬起，由卷扬机把料罐吊到炉顶上。另外，车上有一称盘，可以准确地看出料罐内所装矿石的重量。如果高炉每天平均上料一百六十次，那末称量车每隔九分钟就得来回跑一趟。没有它，高炉就不能生产。
    鞍钢八号高炉需要三台称量车，原是向国外订货的，而且以为订货早来了。但是，在开炉前三月开箱一看，才知已运来的是地磅而不是称量车。为不影响开炉计划，公司决定赶紧修复九号高炉两台旧称量车先行使用。并由五个单位组成了一个委员会来主持这一工作。
    这样，我们的设计就开始了。
    关于抬罐的速度问题，现场的意见是抬高一五○粍应用十秒，苏联为我们做的炼铁厂初步设计上规定是六秒。但我们主观地认为愈快愈妙，确定为一点五秒。在这样高速下，本来三十匹马力可做到的事，就须一百四十匹马力才行。但是我们设计的马达却仍是三十匹马力。
    旧车在省力的杠杆下，用十四吨的力就能抬起二十五吨的重量。我们为了使抬罐高度增加三倍，采用了单纯移动杠杆支点的办法，把省力的杠杆变成了费力的杠杆，要用四十二点五吨的力，才能把二十五吨的重量抬起，这显然是不合理的。由于力量增大，全套装配也随之加大。但在旧车体上只剩一二○粍的空隙里，加下去一个三五○粍宽的轴承，轴承太大了，就把它的耳朵割去了，八根主梁的槽钢上都被挖了大缺口。
    按照这样的设计做出来的称量车，在第一次试车时竟连空罐也抬不起来。即使试车成功，一个月后主梁也非断不可。
    结果是：拖延了应该完成的期限达四月之久。如果不是国外订货及时到达，就将严重影响到高炉按时开炉。原计划投资十二亿元，实际上浪费了十五亿元。现在这两台称量车就像两具死尸一样，躺在修理厂里已经半年了。
    产生这些严重的设计错误和浪费的原因，是由于我们既没有学习苏联先进经验，也没有接受群众的意见，责任心不强。
    我们是没有设计称量车的经验的。在我们最初接到任务时，知道图库里有八十二张伪满遗留下来的称量车旧图，我们就依样画葫芦地照搬了这套设计。心想：“既然是日本人已有了图样，就不会错。”
    当时，有一台新式的苏联称量车和它的全套设计图纸来到了，苏联的新车也是三十匹马力抬高一五○粍，但苏联所用的装置不是凸轮和杠杆，而是先进的扇形齿轮传动。有了这个依据，照道理错误是应该得到纠正了，但是我们只用了不到半天的时间来“研究”这些资料，在草率地翻阅过之后，就粗率地认为“苏联的先进技术不适用于我们的实际情况”。尽管苏联先进的技术资料摆在我们的手边，我们却仍然舍不得抛弃日本人的那些旧图，认为这才是技术上的“法宝”和“依靠”。
    事实有力地说明了苏联的经验运用到旧车上来是完全可能的。两位去年暑期毕业的年轻技术员徐甫根和李广春在知道这件事情后，主动到现场去调查研究了几天，就把苏联扇形齿轮的原理成功地运用到我们的旧车上来了。由于采用了扇形齿轮式的传动，可以使三十匹马力的马达在六秒钟内将二十五吨重的东西抬起一五○粍，符合了苏联初步设计规定的要求。这一设计的草图得到了苏联专家的赞许。
    拒绝学习苏联先进经验，这就是我们设计错误的第一个原因。
    只要能够虚心听一听工人的意见，这个错误也是可以得到纠正的。在第一次试车前后，工人们曾对设计提出了十四条主要意见。我们设计中的错误，有经验的工人全都预见到了。但我们对这些意见采取了什么态度呢？
    我们的态度是：有时错误已经暴露了，却硬想“解释”过去，好少改一些，以免伤“面子”。如凸轮设计得不合理，工人提出具体的改进意见，我们却说：“差一点不要紧，就这样吧！”
    在更多的情况下，我们往往引用一些“理论”根据来堵塞工人的口。有一位姓梁的工人说：“抬罐像一个人扛米一样，想一哈腰就扛起来是不行的，但稳一稳，慢慢拿就行了。”意思是说速度不减低，马力是不够用的，并提出了具体的办法。这个意见很好，但我们反把一大张计算公式掏出来塞给他看，以为这样一来就可以塞住他的嘴了。实际上这个计算是错误的，马力就算错了三倍。
    我们既没有丰富的实际生产知识，又不肯虚心听取工人的意见。有一个工程师说工人的意见是“瞎子算命”，有的认为工人的意见是“大惊小怪”“找毛病”。在第二次试车返工后，我们主观地认为这次设计没啥问题了，于是便用报复的态度向工人说：“如果有问题，就一定是你们安装上的毛病！”把轴承设计的错误硬推在工人身上。
    造成这一错误的另一原因，是我们不负责任的工作态度。设计总负责人一开始就不高兴接受这项任务。接过来后，就转手交给孙开藩工程师，从此不闻不问。孙开藩很讨厌修理破车。因此右手接过任务，左手就交给了两个技术员。设计负责人既把设计任务看成包袱，抱着“做出来算数”“图纸出门万事大吉”的态度，因此有人提出抬罐速度太快，须加极限开关时，总负责人便说：“委员会原来分工的合同上没有这项规定，我们不管。”明明设计已出了严重的错误，我们却头疼医头地补漏洞，从来没想到要把整个设计做一次全面的考虑和检查，因此设计错误的关键长期没有发现出来。
    我们对待技术根据也是极不严肃的。如没有调查研究原始资料竟把道听途说的材料作为根据。测绘车体时，主观地假定两台车是完全相同的，而且假定每台车是完全对称的，因此只测了一台车的一半。结果造成了设计中的错误。在技术理论上，我们甚至不欢喜以科学的计算来决定问题，而是草率地凭灵感决定（如抬罐的速度问题）。
    此外，缺乏设计的整体观念，把整体的称量车分割开来设计，彼此间又不主动联系，也造成了很多遗漏和机件互不配合的恶果。
    通过称量车设计思想的检查，使我们更清楚地认识到资本主义技术思想的危害之大。我们如果不经过艰苦的思想改造，就不可能搞好设计工作，而且将会给国家带来严重的损失。我们祖国大规模的建设已经开始了，经过这次思想建设运动，我们都清楚地认识到我们任务的重大与光荣，今后我们一定要认真学习政治，学习苏联先进的技术，虚心地向苏联专家请教。我们相信，今后一定能把工作搞得更好些。
