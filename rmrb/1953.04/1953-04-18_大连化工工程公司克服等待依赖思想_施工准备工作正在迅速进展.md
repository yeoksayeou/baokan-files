The Dalian Chemical Engineering Company has criticized the ideology of waiting and dependency from top to bottom, fostering a spirit of initiative to overcome difficulties, and greatly accelerating construction preparations.

The company's construction tasks for this year are three to four times greater than last year's, but until a month ago, they had not started preparations. At that time, whenever construction preparations were mentioned, the company's leaders would frown and complain: "The company was established not long ago, there are few cadres, the organization is incomplete, the business is unfamiliar, and there are too few people who can do things!" Or, "The project plan was determined late, which delayed our construction preparations!"... Of course, these are undeniable objective difficulties; but the problem lies in the fact that the company's leaders adopted a passive attitude towards these difficulties. If they had displayed a positive and proactive spirit, these difficulties could have been overcome. Take material preparation as an example. Most of this year's construction projects have been done before. Not only are there actual project samples on-site, but there are also many materials and drawings. If these existing equipment, drawings, and materials are collected and studied, and experienced veteran workers are invited to study them, a relatively accurate material plan can be formulated. However, the staff of the materials department emphasized that they could not make a material plan without drawings, and did not try to overcome the difficulties at all, and dragged on until the end of February this year before making an extremely hasty material plan. For example, one of the important materials, nitro steel, required more than 200 tons, but only 100 tons were ordered in the plan; heat-resistant iron was completely omitted. The main materials were like this, and the general materials were even more different from the actual needs. Because the material plan was delayed, procurement could not be carried out. A large batch of raw iron plates, which are difficult to buy on the market, was stockpiled in the Lushun-Dalian Machinery and Hardware General Factory. However, by the time the plan came out and they went to buy it, this batch of materials had already been transferred to Tianjin. The same was true in terms of processing and ordering. As soon as they encountered a little difficulty, they wrote "special reports" to the leading organs, relying on the higher authorities to solve the problem. Sometimes, in order to reduce their own "trouble," they asked other factories to process the work that they could do themselves; some equipment that could be made domestically was also submitted to the central government for ordering abroad. As a result, the central government did not approve it, which not only did not reduce trouble, but also delayed the ordering time.

In late February, the CPC Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee strictly criticized this passive ideology of waiting and dependency when inspecting the company's construction preparations, and studied solutions to the problems with them. Then, the company's Party committee held a cadre meeting to unify the leadership's thinking and decided to catch up in mid-March. Then, a cadre and worker meeting was held to carry out in-depth ideological mobilization, and the slogan "Make March the Key Month for Carrying Out Construction Preparations" was put forward. The workers responded to this call with practical actions. The Materials Supply Section first rectified its work, leaving a small number of people in charge of supplying materials for the unfinished projects of last year, and drawing out the rest to prepare for the materials for the whole year. If some drawings were not drawn, everyone took the initiative to dig out the past drawings and materials, and invited the work area director, technicians, and veteran workers to study them together. In just over ten days, the material plans for the second quarter and the whole year were drawn up. This plan was repeatedly reviewed and compared by veteran workers and staff, who believed that the accuracy could reach more than 90%. While formulating the material plan, the purchasing agents went to various factories to understand the inventory situation, so that they could buy the materials immediately after the plan was drawn up. After the material plan was drawn up, they immediately set off to the central government to request the allocation of state-controlled materials, and to major cities across the country to purchase materials that were difficult to buy. In order to direct the activities of purchasing personnel scattered across the country, they also stipulated that they should contact each other by long-distance telephone every two days. The purchasing personnel reported the completion of the procurement tasks to the company, and the company assigned new procurement tasks to the purchasing personnel. After such efforts, according to statistics as of March 22, all the materials needed for April had been resolved, 95.2% had been transported to the company, and the rest had also begun to be shipped. 24.38% of the materials used throughout the year had arrived at the company, and the material supply problem had been basically solved. In terms of processing and ordering, the more than 300 tons of steel castings that had been shouted for months without being resolved were now actively contacted with the processing departments and resolved. For example, some processing plants were unwilling to process for them due to insufficient manpower, so they took the initiative to lend their factory workers to the processing plant; if the processing plant did not have models, they asked the model workers in the company to assist the processing plant in making them. After more than 20 days of efforts, the conditions for construction have been met. Now the company has begun to arrange the order of commencement of each project and formulate construction plans.

    大连化工工程公司克服等待依赖思想
    施工准备工作正在迅速进展
    大连化工工程公司由上而下地批判了等待依赖思想，发挥主动克服困难的精神，大大加速了施工的准备工作。
    今年化工工程公司担负的建筑任务，相当于去年的三、四倍，但在一个月以前，他们还没有着手进行准备工作。那时，若一提施工准备工作，公司的领导干部总要愁眉苦脸地诉说：“公司成立不久，干部少，机构不健全，业务生疏，能干事的人太少了！”或说，“工程方案确定得晚，推迟了我们的施工准备！”……当然这些都是不可否认的客观困难；但问题在于该公司的领导干部对这些困难采取了消极的态度。如果他们发挥积极主动的精神，这些困难是可以克服的。就以材料准备为例，今年的建设工程大部分过去都曾干过，不仅现场有工程实样，并有许多资料和图纸；如果把这些原有的设备、图纸及资料加以搜集研究，再请有经验的老工人来研究一下，完全可以订出一个比较正确的材料计划。可是，材料部门的工作人员强调没有图纸不能作材料计划，根本不去设法克服困难，一直拖到今年二月末，才做出一个极其草率的材料计划来。比如：重要材料之一的硝钢，需要二百多吨，计划中只订了一百吨；耐热铁竟全部被遗漏掉了。主要材料如此，一般的材料更是订得与实际需要相差悬殊。由于材料计划迟迟不决，采购工作就无法进行。有一种市面上很难买到的原铁板，在旅大机械五金总厂积压了一大批。但是，等到计划出来再去买时，这批材料已经被调拨到天津去了。在加工订货方面也是如此，只要碰到一点困难，就向领导机关写“专题报告”，依赖上级解决。有时甚至为了减少自己的“麻烦”，自己能够加工的活，也要请别厂加工；有些在国内能做的设备，也呈请中央到国外订货。结果中央不批准，不但没减少麻烦，反而推迟了订货时间。
    二月下旬，中共旅大市委在检查该公司的施工准备工作时，对这种等待依赖的消极思想进行了严格的批评，并和他们一起研究了解决问题的办法。然后，公司党委召开了干部会，统一了领导思想，决定在三月中紧追一步。接着又召开干部、职工大会进行深入的思想动员，提出“把三月份作为开展施工准备关键月”的口号。职工用实际行动响应了这个号召。材料供应科首先整顿了科里的工作，留下一少部分人负责供应去年没完成工程的材料，其余的人全部抽出来准备全年的材料。部分图纸没画出来，大家就主动地把过去的图纸、资料翻出来，请来工区主任、技术人员、老工人共同研究。十多天里就把第二季度和全年所用的材料计划订出来了。这个计划经老工人和职员们反复审查对照，认为正确性可达百分之九十以上。在制订材料计划的同时，采购员们则分别到各厂去了解库存材料情况，以便在计划订出后，能马上把材料买来。当材料计划订出之后，他们就立即出发到中央去请求拨付国家控制的材料，到全国各大城市采购难买的材料。为了指挥分散在全国各地的采购人员的活动，他们又规定每隔两天要用长途电话联系一次，采购人员向公司汇报采购任务完成的情况，公司向采购人员布置新的采购任务。经过这样一番努力，截至三月二十二日的统计，四月份所需的材料已全部解决，有百分之九十五点二已运到公司，其余的也已开始运发，全年所用的材料已有百分之二十四点三八到达公司，材料供应问题已基本解决。在加工订货方面，过去喊叫了数月没有解决的三百余吨铸钢件，这次主动地和加工部门联系，也解决了。比如有些加工厂因人力不足而不愿给他们加工，他们就主动地将本厂工人借给加工厂；加工厂没有模型，他们就让公司里的模型工人协助加工厂做。经过二十多天的努力，施工的条件已经具备。现在该公司已开始排定各个工程的开工次序，制订施工计划。
