Soviet Experts Help China's Petroleum Industry
Liu Fang

China began developing its petroleum industry as early as 1907. However, the foundation of the petroleum industry left over from old China was very weak. The Yanchang Oil Mine was developed for 40 years with little success. The Sichuan petroleum exploration work began more than ten years ago, but only six exploratory wells were drilled, distributed haphazardly across various different structures (a "structure" refers to a geological formation suitable for oil storage). Each well failed to reach a definite conclusion. In order to facilitate their dumping of petroleum, imperialist elements fabricated a fallacy, saying: "The interior of Asia, including the Mongolian Plateau, most of China, and the Tibetan mountain range, has virtually no possibility of petroleum deposits." Some Chinese geologists also believed this, thinking that China was a country lacking in petroleum resources, and therefore lacked confidence in petroleum exploration. In already developed oil fields, the utilization rate of equipment was also very low because many problems in production could not be solved.

After liberation, Soviet experts such as Mosiyev, Neregin, and Zapruzhin provided enthusiastic and selfless assistance to China's petroleum industry. They theoretically affirmed that China is a country rich in oil and introduced advanced scientific methods for petroleum geological exploration. They also helped us solve many problems in the production of existing oil mines, greatly increasing the potential of existing equipment. In 1952, the annual output of petroleum had already exceeded the highest level before liberation by 19.66 percent.

China is a Country Rich in Oil

Soviet experts believe that oil is produced around China, such as in Soviet Central Asia, Ulaanbaatar in the Mongolian People's Republic, Sakhalin Island, the Irrawaddy River basin in Burma, the northern end of the Bay of Bengal in India, and within Pakistan. Some of their geological structures are similar to those in China, so "China is located in the middle of oil-producing countries, and China's underground petroleum resources are abundant."

Why did people, even some geologists in China, in the past believe that China lacked petroleum resources? Because they based their views on the distribution of world oil fields, believing that oil could only be found in the Cenozoic Tertiary period, and that only marine facies strata could produce oil. In fact, these are all erroneous theories. Soviet experts pointed out: When searching for oil, attention should be paid to both new and old strata, and the Tertiary strata should not be emphasized exclusively. At the same time, according to the research of Soviet geologists, 98 percent of the oil on Earth is generated from plant remains. Plants themselves can be divided into two parts: one part is solid, and the other part is liquid (such as oils and fats). The solid part becomes coal, and the liquid part, after dissolving in water, becomes a carbohydrate like tea, which is deposited along with other objects in the water. Under the influence of water, it becomes oil-bearing hydrocarbons (this is also the case in lakes). According to this principle, oil generation may occur in deltas, in lakes, and in bays (i.e., in strata between marine and terrestrial facies). The view that only marine facies strata contain oil is incorrect. By criticizing these incorrect theories, the scope of our search for oil has been greatly expanded.

Soviet experts also helped us change the past practice of blindly searching for oil, pointing out that China's exploration work should start from areas with existing oil mines in the northwest and gradually expand to other areas. As a result of exploration carried out according to this method, the Yumen Oil Mine is now considered an excellent oil field, and the reserves we know are gradually expanding. The Wusu Oil Field in Xinjiang has been proven to be a "naturally endowed" high-yield well. Sichuan's natural gas is also well-known. Based on the general rule that where there is gas, there may be oil, we will also strengthen the exploration of oil sources in Sichuan. The Yanchang Oil Field will also be vigorously explored as one of the new China's petroleum bases, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts. Soviet experts also specifically pointed out the path for us to explore the Yanchang Oil Field.

Learning Soviet Scientific Oil Field Exploration Methods

To develop China's petroleum industry, it is also necessary to change the backward state of exploration work in the past and overcome the blindness of exploratory well work. Soviet experts put forward that, under normal circumstances, the following five conditions must be met before drilling an exploratory well: 1. Oil storage structure; 2. Oil storage layer; 3. Oil-capping layer; 4. Oil and gas shows; 5. Oil layer pressure. This makes us understand how to meticulously consider the theoretical basis and practical evidence in exploration work, and how to carry out work in a planned and step-by-step manner, overcoming the hasty and blind "chance" method of finding oil. This is an important experience for our exploration work. Soviet expert Neregin said it well: It is impossible to require that all wells can discover oil fields in all cases. Even with the most perfect detection methods, it is still not easy to achieve this. However, this does not mean that drilling work should be based on the principle of "taking chances." Geological exploration work must be based on theory and practice.

In terms of surface geological surveys, Soviet experts introduced the Soviet advanced experience - the geological point method. The main shortcomings of our past geological survey work were: First, a perfunctory, sketching-style survey, obtaining few materials, and these materials were inaccurate and unreliable; second, there were many subjective guesses and speculations, and few factual investigations and studies; third, everyone had their own views and practices, the results obtained could not be checked, and work experience was difficult to disseminate and exchange; at the same time, there was no certain quota standard for work, no consideration of costs, and no attention to efficiency. The Soviet geological point method is the best way to correct this subjective and arbitrary working method. The geological point method requires that every geological natural outcrop, or man-made outcrop, be accurately measured with instruments, drawn on a map, and the height and rock properties, stratum thickness, dip angle, dip direction, and plant and animal fossils of each geological point be recorded. Fossils and rocks should be collected and numbered in detail, and then sent to the laboratory for detailed study. Based on the records of geological points, a detailed geological map and structural map of an area can be filled in; at the same time, because each point has accurate measurements and detailed records, the maps produced are also reliable and based on evidence. This method is advanced and scientific, and it is combined with the quota system in production, so it has the power to promote production and improve work efficiency. Soviet experts also helped us solve the problem of oil production in low-pressure oil fields. In the old concept of many people in China, only oil wells that can self-flow after completion have exploitation value. Low-pressure oil layers are oil layers that cannot self-flow, and in the past, such oil layers were often abandoned. Soviet experts criticized this practice, pointing out that drilling wells is for testing oil. It is better to drill fewer wells and test the oil well. They also helped us to set up an oil testing plan, testing oil, gas, and water layer by layer. We must clarify the various properties of the oil field, otherwise we will never easily discard any oil layer. After careful oil testing, a certain well in Silangmiao finally found oil. Although there was not much oil, the performance of each oil layer was gradually understood, which was convenient for drawing scientific conclusions. Since then, our technicians have gradually reversed the irresponsible and unsubstantiated work style in oil testing work, and learned how to test oil layers, which has greatly improved our oil testing technology.

Unleash Production Potential and Increase Labor Productivity

Soviet experts also paid great attention to improving the productivity of existing producing oil wells. For example, in the Laojunmiao Oil Field, the viscosity of crude oil was high and easy to congeal wax, which affected the production of oil wells. After research by Soviet experts, they suggested using hot oil to flush, which has achieved initial results. After flushing with hot oil, the output of a certain well can be increased to 100 percent, up to 200 percent. Thanks to the suggestions of Soviet experts, we have also overcome the conservative thinking that it is impossible to drill wells in winter, which has been held for many years, and increased the annual working hours, which has greatly improved work efficiency. For oil wells with low output, Soviet experts suggested using deep-well pumping units to extract oil, which also increased the output a lot. In the past, we never paid attention to repairing old wells. If the output of an oil well was not high, everyone would open a new well. After Soviet experts suggested repairing old wells, we focused on repairing old wells. Now, calculating only from a certain well in Laojunmiao that has been revived after repair, 1 billion yuan of expenses for drilling new wells can be saved (the economic value of the well itself is not counted). This has powerfully criticized the erroneous view of Chinese petroleum workers that "it takes time and money to repair abandoned wells, and it is not worth the effort to treat the deaf and dumb."

In the past three years, under the guidance of advanced Soviet theory and technology, our motherland's petroleum industry has further tapped its production potential, and labor productivity has increased by an average of about three times. For example, taking the labor productivity in 1950 as 100, it was 176.9 in 1951, and 284.2 in 1952. The overall efficiency in 1952 increased by 36 percent compared with 1951. After the equipment utilization rate and labor productivity were improved, China's crude oil production in 1952 (excluding Xinjiang) exceeded the highest output before liberation by 19.66 percent.

Earnestly Learn from Soviet Experience and Rapidly Increase Exploration Strength

To make oil production meet the requirements of national construction, it is necessary to rapidly expand geological strength and drilling scale, and it is necessary to earnestly and conscientiously strive to learn from advanced Soviet experience. The petroleum geological survey team had six teams in early 1950, and will develop five times in 1953; the seismic team will develop seven times; and the gravity team will develop seven times. In terms of drilling, a total of 33,760 meters were drilled from 1940 to 1949 before liberation (of which production wells accounted for 22,059 meters, and exploration wells only 11,701 meters). The number of wells drilled in the three years after liberation is larger than the number in the ten years before liberation (of which exploration wells account for about 77 percent). The planned number of wells to be drilled in 1953 alone will exceed the total number of wells drilled in the ten years before liberation by 60 percent. Last year, under the guidance of Soviet experts and the efforts of employees, drilling efficiency has generally improved.

In the development of the petroleum industry, geological workers play an important role. To bear the arduous tasks of national construction, geological workers must, on the existing foundation, work harder to learn from advanced Soviet experience, improve their technical level, and continue to improve old working methods and working styles. At present, some geological work cadres lack confidence in their work, lack a spirit of research and creativity, and are unwilling to persist in working in one place for a long time, which is not good. We should correctly and deeply understand the complexity and long-term nature of geological exploration work, and we should work harder to learn from advanced Soviet experience and strive to further tap the petroleum resources of the motherland.

    苏联专家对我国石油工业的帮助
    刘放
    我国早在一九○七年就从事石油的开发工作，然而旧中国遗留下来的石油工业的基础是十分薄弱的，延长油矿开发了四十年，成绩不大。四川石油探测工作开始虽不止十年，但只钻过六口探井，无次序地分布在各个不同的构造上（构造是指适于储油的地层形状），每个井都没得出明确结论。帝国主义分子为着便利他们倾销石油，制造出一种谬论，说：“亚洲腹地，包括蒙古高原、中国大部及西藏大山脉，几毫无石油蕴藏之可能。”我国的一些地质工作者也相信这种说法，认为中国是缺乏石油资源的国家，因而对石油探勘工作信心不大。已经开发的油田，因为生产中许多问题解决不了，设备的利用率也非常低下。
    解放后，苏联专家莫希也夫，聂瑞金和扎普鲁今等，对我国石油工业给予了热诚无私的帮助。他们从理论上肯定了中国是多油的国家，并介绍了先进的科学的石油地质探勘工作方法；和帮助我们解决了现有油矿生产中的许多问题，大大发挥了现有设备的潜在能力。一九五二年石油的年产量已经超过解放前最高水平百分之十九点六六。
    我国是多油的国家
    苏联专家们认为，在中国的四周，如苏联的中亚细亚，蒙古人民共和国的乌兰巴托、库页岛、缅甸伊洛瓦底江流域，印度孟加拉海湾北端和巴基斯坦境内都产油。它们的地层构造有的也和中国相似，所以“中国处在油田国家的中间，中国地下石油资源是丰富的。”
    为什么过去甚至在中国有些地质学家中，也认为中国石油资源贫乏呢，因为他们根据世界油田产油分布情况，认为只能在新生代第三纪中去找石油，和只有海相地层可能产油。其实这都是错误的理论。苏联专家指出：找油应对新、老地层同样注意，不能单纯强调第三纪地层。同时，根据苏联地质学家的研究，指明地球上百分之九十八的油是植物遗体生成的。植物本身可分成两部分：一部分为固体，一部分为液体（油脂之类）；固体变成煤，液体在水中经过溶解后成为像茶一样的炭水化合物，随着水中其他物体一直沉积下去，受到水的影响，变成含油的炭氢化合物（在湖中也是如此）。根据这个原理，油的生成可能在三角洲、在湖内、在海湾内（即介于海陆相地层）。那种认为只有海相地层才有油的说法是不对的。由于苏联专家批判了这些不正确的理论，我们找油的范围就大大扩大了。
    苏联专家也帮助我们改变了过去那种盲目找油的作法，指出中国的探勘工作，应当先从西北已有油矿的地区做起，逐渐向其他地区推广。根据这个方法进行探勘的结果，现在玉门油矿已被认为是优良油田，我们所知道的储量正逐渐扩大。新疆乌苏油田已被证明是“得天独厚”的旺井。四川的天然气也是有名的，根据有气就可能有油的一般法则，我们也将在四川加强探勘油源。延长油田也将根据苏联专家的建议，作为新中国石油基地之一，大力进行探勘。苏联专家并且具体地为我们指出了探勘延长油田的途径。
    学习苏联科学的油田勘探方法
    为了发展我国的石油工业，还需要改变过去探勘工作的落后状况，克服探井工作的盲目性。苏联专家提出了在一般情况下应具备以下五个条件才能打探井：一、储油构造；二、储油层；三、盖油层；四、油气苗；五、油层压力。这使我们懂得了在探勘工作中应该如何精密地考虑理论根据和实际证据，以及如何有计划有步骤地来进行工作，克服草率盲目“碰机会”式的找油方法。对于我们的探勘工作来说，这是一条重要的经验。苏联专家聂瑞金说得好：不可能要求全部钻井在一切情况下都能够发现油田，纵然有最完善的探测方法，仍然不容易作到这一点。但是，这并不是说，钻探工作就应当建筑在“碰机会”的原则上。地质探勘工作一定要在理论上与实际上是有根据的。
    在地面地质调查方面，苏联专家介绍了苏联先进经验——地质点法。我们过去的地质调查工作，主要缺点是：第一、走马看花式地写生调查，获得的材料少，而且不精确、不可靠；第二、凭主观推测臆断的成分多，实事求是的调查研究少；第三、各人有各人的看法与做法，所得的结果无法检查，工作经验难于传播交流；同时工作没有一定的定额标准，不计成本，不讲效率。苏联的地质点法，对纠正这种主观武断的工作方法来说，正是一种最好的办法。地质点法要求把每一个地质的天然露头，或人掘出的露头，用仪器精确测出，绘在图上，记明高度和每个地质点的岩石性质、地层厚度、倾角、倾向和植物、动物化石等。化石和岩石都应详细采集、编号，而后送试验室详细研究。根据地质点的记录，就可以把一个区域的地质图和构造图详细地填出来；同时因为每一点都有精确的测量和详细的记录，作出的图也是可靠的，有根据的。这种方法是先进的，科学的，又和生产中的定额制度相结合，因此就有推动生产，提高工作效率的力量。苏联专家还帮助我们解决了低压油田的产油问题。在我国很多人的旧观念中，认为油井完成后能自喷的才有采油价值。低压油层是不能自喷的油层，过去遇到这样的油层就常常废弃。苏联专家批评了这种作法，指出打井就是为了试油，宁愿少打井，也要试好油。并且帮助我们定出试油计划，逐层试油、试气、试水，一定要把油田各种性能搞清楚，否则决不把任何一个油层轻易丢掉。四郎庙某号井在认真试油后，终于找到了油。虽然油不多，可是逐渐弄明白了各油层的性能，便于作科学的结论。从此我们的技术人员逐渐扭转了试油工作中不负责、不踏实的工作作风，学会了如何试验油层，使我们的试油技术大大提高了一步。
    发挥生产潜力，提高劳动生产率
    苏联专家也很注意提高现有生产油井的生产率。如老君庙油田，过去因为原油黏度大、容易结腊，影响油井的生产量。经苏联专家研究，建议用热油冲洗，已取得初步成绩。某号井经热油冲洗后，产量可提高到百分之一百，最高达百分之二百。由于苏联专家的建议，我们还克服了历年来认为冬季不能打井的保守思想，增加了每年的工作时间，使工作效率大大提高。对产量小的油井，苏联专家建议用深井抽油机来抽油，产量也增加了很多。以前我们一向是不重视修理旧井的。油井出油不多了，大家就要另开新井。苏联专家建议修复旧井后，我们才有重点地进行了修理旧井的工作。现在仅就老君庙修理后复活的某一口井计算，即可节省打新井用费十亿元（本身经济价值未计）。这就有力地批判了我国石油工作者“修复废井，费时费钱，治聋成哑，来头不大”的错误观点。
    三年来，我们祖国的石油工业，在苏联先进的理论和技术指导下，进一步发掘了生产潜力，劳动生产率平均上升了三倍左右。如以一九五○年的劳动生产率为一○○，一九五一年则为一七六点九，一九五二年已达二八四点二，一九五二年较一九五一年全员效率提高百分之三十六。设备利用率和劳动生产率提高以后，一九五二年我国原油产量（不包括新疆）已超过解放前最高产量百分之十九点六六。
    认真学习苏联经验迅速增长勘探力量
    要使采油量适应国家建设的要求，必须迅速扩大地质力量与钻井规模，必须严肃认真地努力学习苏联先进经验。石油地质调查队在一九五○年初为六队，一九五三年将发展五倍；地震队发展七倍；重力队发展七倍。在钻井方面，解放前从一九四○年到一九四九年共钻进三三七六○公尺（其中生产井占二二○五九公尺，探井仅一一七○一公尺。）解放后三年钻井比解放前十年的数字还要大（其中探井约占百分之七十七），仅一九五三年计划钻井数就将超过解放前十年钻井总数百分之六十。去年，经过苏联专家的指导和职工们的努力，钻井的效率普遍提高了。
    在石油工业发展中，地质工作者起着重要作用。为了负担起国家建设的艰巨任务，地质工作者必须在既有的基础上，更加努力学习苏联先进经验，提高自己的技术水平，继续改进旧的工作方法和工作作风。目前有些地质工作干部对于自己的工作缺乏信心，也缺乏钻研精神和创造性，不大愿意长期地在一个地方坚持工作，这都是不好的。应该正确地深刻地认识地质探勘工作的复杂性、长期性，应该更加努力地学习苏联的先进经验，为进一步发掘祖国的石油资源而奋斗。
