    Do a Good Job of Agricultural Loans to Support Spring Planting and Production
    To support farmers in spring planting and production, the People's Bank of China is issuing agricultural loans across the country. The amount of agricultural loans this year is equivalent to the total agricultural loans from 1950 to 1952. This year's agricultural loans are divided into three categories according to their uses: first, agricultural production equipment loans (including animal-drawn farm implements, water pumps, draft animals, breeding stock, carts, and agricultural machinery and tools); second, general agricultural loans (including seeds, feed, small farm tools, and fertilizers); and third, short-term revolving loans (including farmers' temporary needs, or the needs of primary market handicrafts and transportation and sales businesses that serve agricultural production). This year's task of issuing agricultural loans is more arduous than in previous years due to the large amount and wide scope. All rural finance cadres should, under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, with the cooperation of supply and marketing cooperatives and the help of the broad masses of farmers, complete this work in a timely and accurate manner.
    The amount and types of agricultural loans must fully meet the actual needs of farmers. If the loan plan is out of touch with the actual needs of farmers, it will inevitably waste state funds and arouse farmers' opposition. The newly formulated loan plans for the first and second quarters in many regions focus on agricultural production equipment loans, and among the production equipment loans, the repair of dams, the opening of canals, the digging of wells, and the promotion of new agricultural implements occupy the main part. This is not suitable for the current actual needs of farmers. Because today's farmers do not yet have enough strength, and therefore do not have an urgent need for large-scale technical improvements, if the bank excessively emphasizes the issuance of production equipment loans, it will inevitably create a phenomenon of commandism. Hebei Province plans to help farmers dig 100,000 wells and promote 11,750 new-style walking plows this year (equivalent to four times last year). Some counties have forcibly assigned this excessively high planned requirement, arousing farmers' dissatisfaction. Renqiu County distributed 15 new-style walking plows last year, and seven of them have not yet been loaned out. The county plans to promote 260 more this year, an increase of more than 16 times compared with last year, but there are only three cadres who do not understand technology responsible for promoting new agricultural implements. It should be recognized that agricultural equipment loans are the development direction of national agricultural loans, but at present, according to the actual needs of farmers, excessively high plans should not be rigidly formulated. Therefore, people's banks at all levels should earnestly study and review agricultural loan plans with relevant departments and appropriately revise parts that are not in line with the actual situation. It is necessary to earnestly implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Party committees at all levels on spring planting production, and issue agricultural loans to farmers who really have difficulties in production and request loans. It is not allowed to force apportionment, and it is not allowed to overemphasize the dedicated use of funds.
    All agricultural loans should be "reasonably distributed between organized farmers and individual farmers. It is wrong if agricultural loans are not lent to individual farmers, but concentrated on a few mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, so that a few advanced teams and cooperatives are separated from the general mutual aid teams and the broad masses of farmers." In the past and now, the phenomenon of blindly concentrating agricultural loans has occurred in many areas. The agricultural producers' cooperative in Matai Village, Liaolan County, Shandong Province, received 100.06 million yuan in agricultural loans last year, while the cooperative's total annual output value was only 120 million yuan, with loans accounting for more than 88 percent of the total output value. The Geng Changsuo agricultural producers' cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, received 400 million yuan in loans this year, while the cooperative's total output value is only about 900 million yuan. This approach has burdened organized farmers with excessive debts, making them unable to repay loans for a long time, affecting their enthusiasm for production, and arousing dissatisfaction among individual farmers. Local banks should earnestly determine the proportion of loans according to the proportion of organized farmers and individual farmers in the local area, opposing both absolute concentration and average dispersion. For loans to mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, an appropriate issuance ratio should be determined based on their total annual output value and their own funds, based on the principle of not exceeding their realistic economic capacity. In order to enable agricultural loans to play their due role, supply and marketing cooperatives should adapt to the needs of local farmers at that time and do a good job in supplying means of production and means of livelihood. People's banks at all levels should, through short-term loans, guide private industry and commerce to carry out the production and supply of means of production and means of livelihood according to the needs of farmers, so as to avoid the phenomenon of having funds but no goods or having goods but no funds. Supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas have paid attention to the supply of means of production for spring planting and production, guaranteeing the needs of farmers. However, cooperatives in many areas have not yet paid attention to this work. Some cooperative cadres in Acheng County, Songjiang Province, said: "It's okay to handle the hoes and plowshares needed for spring planting and production when they are needed." As a result, many things needed by local farmers could not be bought for a while. Hunan Province issued 166 billion yuan in fertilizer loans, but the cooperatives only prepared 50 billion yuan worth of fertilizer. In Changshou, Luxian and other places in Sichuan Province, loans could not be issued due to insufficient supply of cattle and fertilizer. In order to solve this problem, local cooperatives and banks should, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government organs, closely coordinate the agricultural loan plan with the supply of materials. If certain commodities are indeed in short supply, the bank may consider appropriately reducing the amount of loans. In order to take care of the actual difficulties of farmers' decentralized production, the issuance of agricultural loans should be simplified and farmers' time should be saved.
        Currently, it is a tense period for the issuance of agricultural loans. Leading cadres of people's banks at all levels should personally grasp this work, organize forces in a timely manner, conduct in-depth inspections, and provide specific assistance, so as to conduct inspections while issuing loans, so as to improve their work in a timely manner and strive to support spring planting and production and win a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

### 做好农业贷款工作，支持春耕生产

    做好农业贷款工作，支持春耕生产
    中国人民银行为了支援农民进行春耕生产，正在各地发放农业贷款。今年农业贷款的数量，相当于一九五零年到一九五二年农业贷款的总和。今年的农业贷款，按其用途分为三类：一是农业生产设备贷款（包括马拉农具、抽水机、力畜、种畜、大车、药械等），二是一般农业贷款（包括种籽、饲料、小农具、肥料等），三是短期周转性贷款（包括农民临时性的需要，或为农业生产服务的初级市场的手工业、运销商业的需要）。今年发放农业贷款的任务，由于数量多，范围宽，较往年更加繁重。全体农村金融工作干部应该在当地党政机关的领导，供销合作社的配合和广大农民的帮助下，及时而准确地作好这个工作。
    农业贷款的数量和种类必须完全适合农民的实际需要，如果贷款计划和农民的实际需要脱节，必然浪费国家的资金，且将引起农民的反对。许多地区新制定的第一、二季度贷款计划，都以生产设备贷款为主，在生产设备贷款中，修坝、开渠、打井和推广新式农具又占主要部分。这是不适合当前农民的实际需要的。因为今天农民还没有足够的力量、因此也就还没有迫切的需要进行大规模的技术改良，银行如果过分强调发放生产设备贷款，必然要造成强迫命令现象。河北省今年计划以贷款帮助农民打井十万眼、推广新式步犁一万一千七百五十部（相当于去年的四倍），有些县把这种过高的计划要求硬派下去，引起农民的不满。任邱县去年分配了十五部新式步犁，至今尚有七部未贷出去，该县今年又计划推广二百六十部，比去年增加了十六倍多，但负责推广新式农具的，仅有三个不懂技术的干部。应该认识：农业设备贷款是国家农业贷款的发展方向，但在目前，按照农民的实际需要看来，却不应硬性地制定过高的计划。因此，各级人民银行应该与有关部门切实研究和审查农贷计划，把不适合实际情况的部分加以适当的修改。必须认真执行中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示，把农业贷款发给生产上确有困难而要求贷款的农民，不得强迫摊派，不要过分强调专款专用。
    全部农业贷款应在“组织起来的农民和个体农民两方面做合理的分配。如果不贷给单干农民，只把农业贷款集中贷给少数互助组和农业生产合作社，使少数先进的组社脱离一般的互助组和广大农民，这是不对的。”过去和现在，在不少地区，都曾发生盲目集中地使用农业贷款的现象。山东蓼兰县马台村的农业生产合作社，在去年曾得到农业贷款一亿零六百万元，而该社全年生产总值仅一亿二千万元，贷款占生产总值百分之八十八以上。河北饶阳县耿长锁农业生产合作社今年得到贷款四亿元，而该社全部生产总值仅约有九亿元左右。这种作法，使组织起来的农民，负债过多，长期无力归还贷款，影响了生产积极性，并且引起单干农民的不满。各地银行应该切实根据当地组织起来的农民和个体农民的比例，适当地确定贷款比例数额，既反对绝对集中，又反对平均分散。对于互助组、农业生产合作社的贷款，应根据其全年生产总值及其自有资金，掌握适当的发放比例，以不超过其现实的经济能力为原则。为了使农业贷款发挥应有的作用，供销合作社应该适应当时当地农民的需要，做好生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。各级人民银行应该通过短期贷款，引导私营工商业根据农民需要，进行生产资料和生活资料的生产和供应，以免发生有款无货或有货无款的现象。许多地区的供销合作社已经注意了春耕生产资料的供应工作，保证了农民的需要。但不少地区的合作社至今还没有重视这种工作。松江省阿城县有些合作社的干部说：“春耕生产需要的铧子、锄板，现用现办也赶趟。”结果当地农民需用的许多东西，一时都买不到。湖南省发放了一千六百六十亿元的肥料贷款，但合作社只准备了五百亿元的肥料。四川省的长寿、泸县等地因为耕牛、肥料供应不及，结果贷款不能发放。为了解决这个问题，各地合作社和银行应在当地党、政机关的统一领导下，把农业贷款计划与物资供应工作密切配合起来，如果某些商品确实供应不及，银行可考虑适当减少贷款数额。为了照顾农民的分散生产的实际困难，发放农业贷款要切实简化手续，节省农民时间。
        目前正是发放农业贷款的紧张时期，各级人民银行领导干部应该亲自掌握这一工作，及时组织力量，深入检查，具体帮助，作到边放边查，以便及时改进工作，为支援春耕生产，争取今年农业生产的丰收而努力。
