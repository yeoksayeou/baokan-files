    How I Became an Active Learner and Promoter of Advanced Soviet Experience
    Rong Ke
    Engineer of State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory
    Special-Class Labor Model of Shanxi Province
    I worked as a researcher at the British Foundrymen's Institute for eight years. In 1948, I returned to the motherland with excitement. In June 1950, I participated in the construction of the State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory, responsible for designing and planning a large-scale mechanized casting workshop for gray cast iron blanks. When the leadership entrusted me with this task, I felt very excited and honored, determined to do this job well.
    I knew the task was very arduous, because there was no such mechanized casting workshop in China for reference. But I was also very confident: the factories where I interned in England, such as Rolls-Royce Aircraft Factory, Anti-Nicgu Automobile Foundry, and Ford Motor Company's Foundry in London, were all among the best in Europe. I had a considerable understanding of their mechanization and production figures. I felt that relying on these, I could overcome the difficulties, so I accepted the task without any worries. At that time, the organization repeatedly asked me to refer to Soviet design materials, but I thought: in industry, the United Kingdom and the United States have a history of more than a hundred years, while the Soviet Union has only been established for more than thirty years. I thought that only the British and American technology I learned could be called the most advanced modern technology, so I didn't even bother to pay attention to these suggestions.
    The design work began. The first step was to determine the layout of the casting workshop and the types and quantities of mechanical equipment. In terms of layout, such as production area and total factory area, I designed everything according to the general British standards. In terms of mechanical equipment, all the types and quantities of equipment we needed were determined by referring to the specifications and productivity of British and American machines.
    (For example, the production volume of small sand casting machines in the UK is no more than 140 boxes per person per shift. I thought that Chinese people would not be able to compare with British people, so I only designed for a production rate of 80 boxes.) After the layout drawing was completed and the amount of mechanical equipment was estimated, I admired this "masterpiece" very much, secretly pleased with myself, thinking that this design could not be found in Soviet materials. The first step was completed very smoothly, but problems arose when the second step was about to begin. Now it was necessary to design all the above equipment in detail and start manufacturing it. This work encountered difficulties. Because the materials I brought back when I returned to China were mostly samples and photos of various companies' product promotions, it was possible to select machines from these samples, but it was impossible to use them as mechanical design materials.
    So what should I do? I had to ask the British Research Institute for help. I had an eight-year friendship with the British Foundrymen's Institute, and I was also very familiar with Jiang Bailun, the president of the Scottish branch, and always regarded him as my "good teacher and friend." I thought that as long as I made a request, he would definitely send me all the materials I needed in detail. Therefore, during the six months from February to August 1951, I wrote him eight or nine letters asking for help in succession (because I couldn't get the point in each letter, so I asked him one or two letters at a time). For the past six months, I had been holding a kind of expectation: every time I got off work, I hoped that when I returned home, my lover would tell me: a lot of data and charts were sent from the UK today.
    However, all I got every day was disappointment. Sometimes Jiang Bailun occasionally sent a simple letter, saying that he was willing to help me as much as possible. Sometimes he also sent a few product promotion samples, but they were not what I needed at all. Regarding the mechanical equipment design materials, he replied that this belonged to the patent rights of various British factories, and he could not get them either. But he could introduce me to purchase them. The most disheartening thing was the last letter, which said that regarding the casting workshop layout design materials I needed, I had to pay 5% of the construction cost of the entire casting workshop before he could help me answer. At that time, I was still obsessed and suggested to the leadership to pay this handling fee. The leadership did not agree and asked me to refer to Soviet materials. I still thought that I had missed a good opportunity and felt very sorry.
    My hopes for the past six months had all vanished, and I was extremely disappointed. When I returned to China in 1948, Jiang Bailun had volunteered to say to me that after I returned to China, he would "respond to every request" for all design materials related to China's construction. At that time, I believed it to be true and did not expect that his "specific help" was actually to ask me to help him sell British machines. After being hit by these nails for the past six months, I gradually realized that the true face of the so-called British academic institutions was just a tool for capitalists to promote and sell goods under the guise of scientific research. Asking them for help was tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger. This road was not passable.
    At this time, our young technician Comrade Huang Lusheng once again introduced me to consult the ninth volume of the Soviet Encyclopedia, saying that this book had particularly rich information on casting machinery and equipment. When I helplessly opened the first page, my heart was still full of doubts. Unexpectedly, beyond my expectations, all the materials that I wanted from the UK but could not get were here: there were detailed general drawings, partial main component drawings, with dimensions, detailed specifications, performance, and operating methods, but no sales advertisements and manufacturer's brands could be seen. Based on these materials, the designs of the main equipment such as sand mold transport vehicles, steel plate conveyor belts, and rubber conveyor belts that we could not solve originally were all solved by referring to this book. At this time, in terms of mechanical design, I felt that the Soviet Union was indeed much more advanced than the United Kingdom and the United States. But was it also advanced in metallurgy? I was still suspicious. So I took a tentative attitude and read the Soviet "Casting Metallurgy Magazine." When I saw the report that the Soviet Union used a complex salt to treat aluminum-silicon alloy, which could increase the aging effect of aluminum-silicon alloy to 30 minutes, this topic immediately attracted me. Because the treatment of aluminum-silicon alloy was a great creation of the United Kingdom in 1920, and it was also considered an immortal masterpiece in the world's metallurgical technology, but the accompanying disadvantage was that because the aging effect could not exceed 10 minutes, it was not suitable for large-scale continuous production. This was a problem that so many authoritative British and American metallurgical experts had not been able to solve for 30 years, but today the Soviet Union had completely solved it. After reading this report, I was very excited and felt that it was truly a great contribution to the metallurgical industry. But was it really as perfect as the report said? I was still a little skeptical. So I did an experiment at the Zhoujiaqiao Factory in Shanghai and tested one each for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes. The results of the metallographic microscope examination were unexpected. The structures of all six samples were exactly the same. At this time, I was really overjoyed. The Soviet Union was really amazing! It had amazing creations in all aspects of technology. Due to these ironclad facts, my long-term belief that British and American technology was "the best in the world" had to begin to go bankrupt.
    I was completely convinced of the superior Soviet technology, but I was still skeptical about the design of economic indicators. When I read the Soviet economic indicator data for casting workshops, I saw that the annual output per square meter of molding area in Soviet casting workshops was 3 tons to 3.7 tons, the annual output per square meter of production area was 1.8 to 2.2 tons, and the production rate per person per shift for small sand casting machines was 500 boxes. What I saw in the United Kingdom, such as the fully mechanized Rolls-Royce factory, had a production area of only 0.9 tons, and Ford was 1.1 to 1.3 tons. This was the most productive casting workshop in the United Kingdom, and British and American experts generally believed that the efficiency of labor and machinery had been maximized and the production management system was the most scientific. Therefore, at that time, I did not consider the Soviet data at all, thinking that the Soviet Union's miraculous figures were not in line with the facts and exceeded the scope of my experience. As a result, I still designed according to the backward British indicators.
    In this way, I almost made a big mistake. In April 1952, when I visited the Shanghai Zhongji Company Manufacturing Factory, I found that the factory's casting workshop had increased production to 280 boxes per person per shift for small sand casting machines by absorbing the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which was twice as high as the highest production rate in the United Kingdom. In the face of this fact, I turned my mistake around and began to realize that the Soviet economic indicators were based on their reasonable mechanical layout, operation methods, and superior mechanical equipment performance, so they could exert very high efficiency. And I had wrongly doubted the Soviet indicators. At that time, I hurriedly returned to the factory and turned around to learn from the Soviet layout again to salvage the huge waste that was about to be caused. When I returned to the factory in May, our temporary casting workshop workers who had just come from the countryside and had only been trained for two months could already do 200 boxes per person per shift on small sand casting machines, which shocked me even more and quickly sobered me up. With the support and help of the Party branch and the chief engineer, I immediately and systematically modified the mechanical conveying layout and equipment quantity according to the Soviet data together with the equipment design team comrades, modifying more than 50 pieces, accounting for 80% of the total, saving more than 3,000 square meters of factory area and 54 small sand casting machines, saving more than 7 billion yuan in waste.
    Because I learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and saved the factory more than 7 billion yuan in waste, and basically solved the problem of mechanical design, it reminded me that in today's large-scale construction of the motherland, due to the worship of backward British and American technical viewpoints by technicians, a slight mistake in presiding over the design would cause huge waste to the country and delay the progress of national construction. Therefore, I deeply feel that technicians in such a glorious position at present must clearly realize that the set of technologies of British and American capitalism, like their other aspects, is backward, decadent, and can no longer be applied to the construction of our motherland. We must not take this backward path again, we must take the path of the Russians and sincerely and humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This is the lesson and experience I have personally experienced.
    Since then, I have often paid attention to Soviet casting technology magazines and books and systematically studied and read them. When we made ductile iron last July, we adopted the general two-step treatment method in China and could not cast thin textile machine parts. At this time, I went to find the Soviet "Casting Metallurgy Magazine" and found the one-time treatment method of silicon-magnesium, sand-iron, and calcium-magnesium complex alloy. I started the experiment in August and achieved success. In September, I also successfully learned the Soviet method of using heat treatment to make acicular cast iron from ductile iron, which can save the country a lot of high-value metals such as nickel steel and can replace a lot of cast steel parts. These methods are still innovations in China. I also helped metal melter Qian Huaisheng, quenching worker Cai Shengfang, and others learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and they also achieved many successes.
    These facts have made me deeply realize that the Soviet Union's help to China's construction is truly sincere and selfless, and we can only get this kind of assistance from the socialist Soviet Union. Last August, Taiyuan City held an advanced experience promotion conference for the machinery manufacturing industry, and I was also invited to participate in the performance of the manufacturing steps of one-time treatment of ductile iron. This conference gave me a profound education and made me realize that in a country where the people are in charge, production is to serve the people's happiness. Therefore, the state pays attention to promoting the creations of employees, even if they are slight improvements, so the technical level will inevitably be able to improve rapidly. In capitalist countries, technology is to serve the purpose of a small number of big capitalists seizing high profits and monopolizing the market. Even if there are inventions, they are stolen by capitalists for their own use. When inventions conflict with the profits of products, capitalists will take various measures to prevent them from ever coming out. This has made me begin to understand why the technology of capitalist countries stagnates and why the technology of the Soviet Union can become the most advanced in the world. I sincerely thank the advanced experience of the Soviet Union for helping us accelerate the construction of the motherland, helping me personally achieve success in my work, and winning the glorious title of "Special-Class Labor Model of Shanxi Province." I am determined to better learn and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in order to maintain the lofty honor given to me by the motherland.

    我怎样变成了苏联先进经验的积极学习者和推广者
    国营经纬纺织机械制造厂工程师
    山西省特等劳动模范
    荣科
    我曾在英国铸工研究院当过八年研究员。一九四八年，我抱着兴奋的心情回到了祖国。一九五○年六月，我参加了国营经纬纺织机械制造厂的建厂工作，负责设计及筹划一个庞大的灰铸铁毛胚的机械化铸工场。当领导上交给我这个任务时，我感到十分兴奋与光荣，决心把这项工作作好。
    我知道任务是非常艰巨的，因为在国内还没有这样机械化的铸工场可作参考。但是我又很自信：我在英国实习的工厂，如罗氏劳斯飞机厂、抗尼谷汽车铸造厂、伦敦福特汽车公司的铸工厂，在欧洲都是首屈一指的。它们机械化的情况及生产数字我全有相当的了解。我觉得，依靠这些，我就有可能克服困难，因此便有恃无恐地接受了这个任务。当时组织上一再叫我参考苏联设计资料，我想：在工业上，英美已有百余年的历史，而苏联建国才不过三十多年。自以为只有自己所学的英美的技术才能称得上现代最优越的技术，因此，对这些意见连理睬都没有理睬。
    设计工作开始了。第一步是决定铸工场的布置及机械设备的种类与数量。在布置方面，如生产面积、总厂房的面积等，我都是遵照英国一般的标准设计的。在机械设备方面，全是参照了英美机器的规格与生产率来决定我们的需要种类及设备量的。
    （如小翻砂机的生产量，在英国每班每人的产量不超过一百四十箱，我认为中国人总不会比得上英国人，因此只照八十箱的生产率设计了。）在布置图画完，机械设备量估计好以后，自己很欣赏这个“杰作”，自鸣得意暗暗自喜，以为这个设计在苏联资料中是万不能找到的。第一步是很顺利地完成了，但是要开始第二步问题就来了。现在是要把以上各种设备详细地设计出来，动手制造。这个工作却遭到了困难。因为我回国时带回来的资料，大部分是各公司商品宣传的样本及照片，在这些样本上选购机器是可以的，但是无法作为机械设计的资料。
    那末怎么办呢？只有向英国研究院去求救。我与英国铸工研究院有八年的交情了，与苏格兰支院院长姜拜伦也很熟，并且一直以他为我的“良师益友”。我想，只要我有所要求，他一定会把我需要的资料详详细细地全部寄来。因此自一九五一年二月到八月这六个月的期间，我曾连续向他写过八、九封求援的信（因为每次来信都得不到要领，故一封、二封地去求他）。这半年来，我一直抱着一种期望：每当下班的时候，就希望当回到家的时候，我的爱人就会这样告诉我：今天从英国寄来了很多资料图表。
    但是，我每天所得到的全是失望。有时姜拜伦偶尔也来一封简单的信，说是愿意尽量地帮助我。有时也寄几本商品宣传样本来，但全不是我所需要的。关于机械设备设计的资料问题，他回信说：这是属于英国各厂的专利权，他也无法要到。但可以介绍购买。最使人灰心失望的是最后的一封信，说是关于我所需要的铸工场布置设计资料，应缴全铸工场的百分之五的建设费方能代为解答。我当时还执迷不悟，曾建议领导上缴纳这笔手续费。领导上没有答应，并叫我参考苏联资料，我还以为失了良机很为惋惜。
    我半年来的希望全成了泡影，失望已极。当我在一九四八年回国时，姜拜伦曾毛遂自荐地对我说，我回国后，凡有关中国建设的设计资料，他是“有求必应”的。当时我还信以为真，没有想到他的“具体帮助”，原来是叫我代他推销英国机器。经过半年来碰了这些钉子后，才使我逐渐认识到，所谓英国学术机关的真面目，只是披着科学研究的外衣，为资本家宣传推销商品的工具而已。要向他们去求援，无啻是与虎谋皮。这条路算是不通了。
    这时，我们的青年技术员黄吕生同志就再度介绍我参阅苏联百科全书第九册，说这本书里铸工机械设备资料特别丰富。当我无可奈何地翻开第一页的时候，心里还充满着怀疑。那知出乎我意料之外，我向英国要而要不到的资料，这里全有：有详细的总图，有部分的主要分图，并附有尺寸，详细的规格、性能及操作方法，只是看不到推销的广告和制造厂的牌号。根据这些资料，我们原来不能解决的砂模运送车、钢板传送带、橡皮运送带等主要设备的设计，均能参考这本书得到全部解决。这时，在机械设计上，我感到苏联确实较英美先进了许多。但是，在冶金方面是不是也先进呢？我还是怀疑。于是我又抱着试探的态度去阅读苏联的“铸冶杂志”，当我看到苏联用复性盐处理铝釸合金，可以使铝釸合金处理时效增加到三十分钟的报道时，这个题目立即把我吸引住了。因为处理铝釸合金是英国在一九二○年的伟大创造，在世界冶金技术上也认为是不朽的杰作，不过相伴而来的缺点是：由于时效不能超过十分钟，不适宜用于大规模的连续生产。这是三十年来多少英美权威冶金专家所没有能够解决的问题，而今天苏联把它彻底解决了。看了这个报道，十分兴奋，觉得真是冶金业上的伟大贡献。但是，是不是真像报道所说那样完善呢？我还有些怀疑。于是便在上海周家桥厂作了一次试验，五分、十分、十五分、二十分、二十五分、三十分各试一根，用金相显微镜检查结果，出人意料，六个样品的全部组织完全相同；这时我真是惊喜交集，苏联真是了不起啊！在各方面的技术上都有惊人的创造。由于这些铁的事实，我长期迷信英美技术是“世界第一”的思想，至此不得不开始破产了。
    我对优越的苏联技术是完全信服了，但是对经济指标设计还是抱着怀疑态度。当我翻阅苏联的铸工场经济指标资料时，看见苏联的铸工场造型面积年产量是每平方公尺产三吨到三点七吨，生产面积年产量是每平方公尺产一点八到二点二吨，小翻砂机每班每人生产率为五百箱。我在英国所见到的，如全部机械化装置的罗氏劳斯厂生产面积量还不过零点九吨，福特是一点一到一点三吨，这是英国生产率最高的铸工场，一般英美专家都认为人工与机械的效能已发挥到最高度，生产管理制度也最科学了。因此当时我对苏联的资料就根本没加考虑，认为苏联这个奇迹般的数字是不合乎事实的，而且也超乎了我的经验所能理解的范围。结果仍然是按照英国的落后指标进行了设计。
    就这样我几乎铸成了大错。一九五二年四月我到上海中机公司制造厂参观时，发现该厂铸工场由于吸取了苏联的先进经验，小翻砂机已增产到每班每人二百八十箱了，较英国最高生产率高出一倍。在这个事实面前，才把我的错误扭转过来，开始体会到苏联的经济指标是有根据的，是与他们合理的机械布置排列、操作方法、及优越的机械设备性能配合一体的，因此能够发挥很高的效率。而自己竟错误地怀疑了苏联的指标。当时即急急返回工厂，倒转头来再学习苏联的布置，以挽回即将造成的巨大浪费。在我五月返厂时，我们的临时铸工场里刚从农村来的才训练了两个月的工人，已能在小翻砂机上做到每班每人二百箱了，这更使我震惊，使我迅速清醒过来。在党支部和总工程师支持帮助下，立即和设备设计组同志在机械化运送布置方面及设备量方面有系统地根据苏联资料进行修改，计修改了五十多件，达总量的百分之八十，使厂房面积节省了三千多平方公尺，小翻砂机节省了五十四部，挽救了七十多亿元的浪费。
    由于我学习了苏联的先进经验，挽救了本厂七十多亿元的浪费，基本上解决了机械设计的问题，使我联想到：在祖国大规模建设的今天，由于技术人员崇拜英美的落后的技术观点，在主持设计时，往往一念之差就会给国家造成巨大浪费，延误国家建设的进度。因此深感技术人员在目前这样光荣的岗位上，必须清醒地认识到：英美资本主义的一套技术，与它们的其他方面一样，是落后了，腐朽了，早已不能适用于我们祖国的建设了。我们切不能再走这条倒退的路，必须走俄国人的路，诚心诚意地虚心地学习苏联的先进经验。这是我切身体会到的教训与经验。
    自此以后，我经常注意苏联的铸工技术杂志及图书，有系统地进行研究阅读。去年七月做球墨铸铁时，我们采用国内一般的两次处理步骤，不能浇薄的纺机零件。这时，我便去找苏联“铸冶杂志”，找到了矽镁、砂铁、钙镁复性合金一次处理方法，八月开始试验，获得了成功。九月又学习苏联用热处理方法由球墨铸铁制成针状铸铁试验成功，可给国家节省大量镍钢等高贵金属，并可代替大量铸钢件。这些方法在国内都还是创举。我又帮助金属鎔工钱怀生、淬火工蔡省方等学习苏联先进经验，也都获得了很多成功。
    这些事实使我深深体会到：苏联对中国的建设的帮助真是真诚无私的，我们也只有在社会主义的苏联那里才能得到这种援助。去年八月太原市举行机器制造业先进经验推广大会，我也被邀参加表演球墨铸铁一次处理的制造步骤。这次会议使我受到深刻的教育，使我认识到，在人民自己当家的国家里，生产是为增进人民幸福而服务的，因此国家对职工的创造，那怕是些微的改进，也注意推广，所以技术水平就必然能够迅速提高。而在资本主义国家里，技术是为少数大资本家攫取高额利润垄断市场服务的，即使有所发明，也被资本家窃为私有，当发明与生产品利润有冲突时，资本家便会采取各种办法使它永世不得出头。这就使我开始理解到：为什么资本主义国家技术会停滞不进，而苏联的技术能成为世界上最先进的道理所在。我衷心感谢苏联先进经验帮助我们加速了祖国的建设，帮助我个人在工作上取得成就，并获得了光荣的“山西省特等劳动模范”的称号。我决心更好地学习与推广苏联的先进经验，以保持祖国给予我的崇高的荣誉。
