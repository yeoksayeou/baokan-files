Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th: The entire commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are safeguarding the security of the motherland and world peace, unanimously support the declarations on the Korean issue made by Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea, and Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union.

    Hou Fuheng, company commander and first-class meritorious hero of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the JinCheng front, said: "We fully support these three declarations by Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov, because they fully conform to the interests of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. If the US government has the sincerity for peace, it should accept this proposal and realize peace in Korea." Xie Xiumei, a famous female meritorious hero of a certain unit, said: "Every one of us supports these declarations, because we want the Korean people to restore a peaceful life as soon as possible, and to protect mothers and children from the threat of death." A regimental commander of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the Shangganling front said: "We have always adhered to a peaceful policy and advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This declaration by Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov is a sign of the unity of our peace and democracy camp and our joint efforts for the cause of peace."

    Commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army also expressed their determination not to relax their vigilance and to fight to the end for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue. Qian Shuxi, a second-class meritorious hero of a certain unit, said: "In the past, the US side has constantly used various despicable means to sabotage the armistice negotiations. If it still wants to play any tricks this time, it will be met with greater opposition from the people of the world; if it launches a military adventure in Korea, it will definitely suffer a doubled blow from the Korean and Chinese People's Armies!"

    Hu Youfu, a political instructor who led the soldiers of his entire company in a fierce battle with the enemy for five days in the Battle of Shangganling, killing more than 500 enemies, said that he would use practical actions to strive for peace in Korea. He said: "At present, the enemy is still conducting germ warfare and gas warfare, and is still continuing its military offensive. Therefore, we must be doubly vigilant. If the enemy launches a new adventurous offensive, we must resolutely defeat it like the Battle of Shangganling." All the commanders and fighters of a certain unit, who won collective merit in the "Dingzishan" battle, held a discussion meeting in the tunnel. They unanimously said: We love peace, but we will never relax our vigilance. If the enemy is unwilling to accept our peace proposals and dreams of continuing and expanding the war of aggression against Korea, we have the determination and strength to fight it resolutely until the Chinese and Korean people achieve complete victory!

    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】保卫着祖国安全和世界和平的中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员一致拥护我国周恩来总理、朝鲜金日成首相、苏联莫洛托夫外长关于朝鲜问题的声明。
    金城前线志愿军某部连长、一等功臣侯福恒说：“周总理、金日成首相和莫洛托夫外长的这三个声明，我们完全拥护，因为它完全符合中朝人民和世界人民的利益。如果美国政府有和平诚意的话，就应该接受这个建议，实现朝鲜的和平”。某部著名女功臣解秀梅说：“我们每一个人都拥护这些声明，这是因为我们要使朝鲜人民早日恢复和平生活，使母亲和孩子们免受死亡的威胁。”上甘岭前线志愿军某部一位团指挥员说：“我们一贯坚持和平政策，主张和平解决朝鲜问题。这次周总理、金日成首相、莫洛托夫外长的声明，正是我们和平民主阵营团结一致、共同为和平事业努力的标志。”
    志愿军的指挥员和战斗员们也表示决不松懈自己的警惕性，要为争取朝鲜问题公平合理的解决而奋斗到底。某部二等功臣钱树喜说：“过去美国方面曾不断用各种卑劣手段破坏停战谈判，这次要是还想玩什么花样，就会受到全世界人民更大的反对；如果它在朝鲜发动军事冒险，一定遭到朝中人民军队加倍的打击！”
    曾在上甘岭战斗中率领全连战士与敌激战五日、杀敌五百多名的政治指导员胡友福表示，要用实际行动来争取朝鲜和平。他说：“目前敌人还在进行细菌战和毒气战，并且仍在继续其军事进攻。因此，我们要加倍警惕，如果敌人发动新的冒险进攻，就要像上甘岭战役一样，坚决打垮它。”曾在
    “丁字山”战斗中荣立集体功的某部全体指挥员战斗员，在坑道里举行讨论会，他们一致表示：我们热爱和平，但决不放松警惕。如果敌人不愿接受我们的和平建议梦想继续和扩大侵朝战争，我们有决心、有力量坚决跟它打下去，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利为止！
