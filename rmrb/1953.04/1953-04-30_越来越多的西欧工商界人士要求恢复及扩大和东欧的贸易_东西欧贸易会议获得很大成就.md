Xinhua News Agency, April 29th dispatch from Geneva: The East-West European Trade Conference, attended by government trade experts from twenty-six countries, closed in Geneva on the 25th. During the nearly two weeks of the conference, representatives from the Soviet Union, Eastern European People's Democracies, and Western European countries such as Britain, France, and Italy held not only plenary meetings to generally discuss the issue of expanding East-West European trade, but also more than a hundred bilateral talks, specifically discussing mutual trade requirements and the exchange of goods. The conference achieved great success. It was decided at the meeting that negotiations to expand mutual trade would be further held in the capitals of East and West European countries in the future. According to people participating in the conference, some countries, including Britain and France, may send trade delegations to Moscow in the future, or invite Soviet trade delegations to their capitals to further discuss the issue of concluding formal trade agreements.

The Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Gunnar Myrdal, who presided over this East-West European Trade Conference, said at a press conference on the day the conference closed: this conference has provided “the possibility of changing the downward trend of East-West European trade. The conference has made a good start in improving trade relations between East and West European countries. Representatives attending the conference unanimously believe that this conference is the most exciting of all the trade conferences held in the past six years.” Myrdal also said that the conference achieved good results, reflected in the understanding reached between many countries to hold comprehensive trade negotiations in the near future.

Some Western European representatives attending the conference also said that the conference was "encouraging." They predicted that the results of the conference may lead to agreements to increase trade between East and West European countries, and restore trade between East and West Europe to pre-war levels.

The successful conclusion of this Geneva East-West European Trade Conference reflects the strong desire of Western European business circles to restore and expand trade with Eastern Europe and their opposition to the U.S. policy of prohibiting Western European trade with Eastern Europe. There has always been a natural economic link between East and West Europe. Trade with Eastern Europe has always occupied an important position in Western Europe's foreign trade. Before the Second World War, the Soviet Union regularly supplied Britain with grain and timber, accounting for 20% and 40% of Britain's total grain and timber imports respectively. Polish coal once supplied 34% of Austria's needs and 25% to 61% of Denmark's needs.

However, since the United States implemented the "Marshall Plan" in 1948, it has forced Western European countries to restrict trade with Eastern Europe, greatly reducing trade between East and West Europe. The volume of trade between East and West Europe in 1952 was less than one-third of the pre-war level of 1938. This result has had a disastrous impact on the economies of Western European countries. Western European countries, which could have imported industrial raw materials and grain from Eastern Europe at close range, had to import them from the United States at high prices. In 1951 alone, Western Europe spent an extra $450 million on freight for importing coal and grain from the United States. This situation greatly deepened Western Europe's dollar crisis. On the other hand, some products of Western European countries, having lost the Eastern European market, had to find outlets in the capitalist world market. However, the conditions for selling goods in the capitalist world market are becoming increasingly deteriorated. The United States dumped goods on Western Europe in large quantities, while at the same time restricting Western European goods from entering the U.S. market. In other capitalist world markets outside the United States, Western Europe has also been fiercely squeezed out by the United States and the U.S.-supported West Germany and Japan. This has led to a general contraction of exports in Western European countries. For example, France's total exports in 1952 were only half of those in 1951. Britain's exports in January of this year were 32 million pounds less than in January of last year. As a result of the decline in exports, many Western European companies have closed down and unemployment has increased significantly.

Precisely because of this, more and more Western European business people are demanding the restoration of trade relations with Eastern Europe. This demand has been supported by the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies. During the International Economic Conference held in Moscow last April, the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies signed trade contracts worth several hundred million U.S. dollars with industrialists and businessmen from Western European countries. After the International Economic Conference, the sentiment in Western European business circles demanding the restoration and expansion of trade with Eastern Europe became increasingly strong. The holding and successful conclusion of the Geneva East-West European Trade Conference show that the restoration and expansion of East-West European trade is full of hope.

### 越来越多的西欧工商界人士要求恢复及扩大和东欧的贸易  东西欧贸易会议获得很大成就

    越来越多的西欧工商界人士要求恢复及扩大和东欧的贸易
    东西欧贸易会议获得很大成就
    【新华社二十九日讯】日内瓦消息：有二十六个国家政府贸易专家参加的东西欧贸易会议已于二十五日在日内瓦闭幕。在近二星期的会议中，苏联和东欧人民民主国家以及英国、法国、意大利等西欧各国代表除了举行全体会议一般地讨论扩大东西欧贸易问题以外，并且分别举行了一百多次的双边谈判，具体地讨论了相互间贸易要求及交换货物问题。会议获得了很大的成就。会上决定今后要在东西欧各国首都进一步举行扩大相互间贸易的谈判。据参加会议的人士称，英国、法国等若干国家在今后可能将派遣贸易代表团到莫斯科，或者邀请苏联贸易代表团到它们国家的首都，来进一步商讨缔结正式贸易协定问题。
    主持这次东西欧贸易会议的联合国欧洲经济委员会执行秘书密达尔，在会议闭幕的当天在记者招待会上说：这次会议已经提供了“改变东西欧贸易下降趋势的可能性。会议使改善东西欧国家间贸易关系获得良好的开端。参加会议的代表一致认为，这次会议是最近六年来所召开的各次贸易会议中最令人兴奋的一次会议。”密达尔又说，这次会议获得了良好的结果，表现在许多国家间已获致谅解，要在最近将来举行全面的贸易谈判。
    参加会议的一些西欧国家代表也说，这次会议是
    “令人鼓舞的”。他们预料，这次会议的结果可能使东西欧国家间最后获致增加贸易的协议，并使东西欧之间的贸易恢复到战前水平。
    这次日内瓦东西欧贸易会议的圆满结束，反映出西欧工商界强烈要求恢复及扩大与东欧的贸易，反对美国的禁止西欧与东欧贸易政策。东西欧之间一向存在着天然的经济联系。在西欧对外贸易中，对东欧贸易一向占重要地位。苏联在第二次世界大战前经常供应英国的谷物和木材，占英国谷物和木材入口总额的百分之二十和百分之四十。波兰输出的煤曾供应了奥地利百分之三十四的需要，供应了丹麦百分之二十五到六十一的需要。
    但是，美国自一九四八年实行“马歇尔计划”以后，即强迫西欧各国限制与东欧的贸易，使东西欧间贸易大大减少。东西欧间在一九五二年的贸易量不及战前一九三八年水平的三分之一。这样的结果对西欧各国经济产生了灾难性的影响。西欧各国本来就近可以从东欧输入的工业原料和粮食，要用高价改从美国输入。在一九五一年中，西欧自美国输入的煤和粮食，仅运费方面就多化费了四亿五千万美元。这种情况大大地加深了西欧的美元危机。另一方面，西欧国家的若干产品由于失去了东欧市场，都要在资本主义世界市场上找寻出路。但是，资本主义世界市场上的销售货物的条件愈来愈恶化了。美国大量向西欧倾销货物，而同时又限制西欧货物进入美国市场。在美国以外的其他资本主义世界市场上，西欧也遭到美国及美国扶植下的西德和日本的猛烈排挤。这样就使得西欧各国的出口普遍萎缩。例如，法国一九五二年的出口总额只有一九五一年的一半。英国今年一月份的出口比去年一月份少了三千二百万英镑。出口衰退的结果，使得西欧各国企业纷纷倒闭，失业大量增加。
    正因为这样，越来越多的西欧工商界人士要求恢复和东欧的贸易关系。这种要求得到苏联和东欧人民民主国家的支持。去年四月在莫斯科举行国际经济会议期间，苏联及人民民主国家与西欧国家的工商业家签订了几亿美元的贸易合同。在国际经济会议以后，西欧工商界要求与东欧恢复和扩大贸易的情绪愈益强烈了。日内瓦东西欧贸易会议的举行及圆满结束表明，恢复与扩大东西欧贸易是充满着希望的。
