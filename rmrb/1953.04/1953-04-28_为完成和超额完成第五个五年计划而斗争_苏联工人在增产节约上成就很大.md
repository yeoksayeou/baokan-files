Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: The Soviet working class, over the past year, has fully unleashed its initiative and creativity, engaging in various socialist labor competitions, and has already achieved great successes in increasing production and practicing economy.

    In 1952, the Soviet working class conducted socialist competitions at a new and higher level. Participants in the competition were not content with merely exceeding production targets but strived for greater achievements in various production indicators. As early as the beginning of 1952, Rozhneva and Kononenko, renowned Stakhanovite workers from the Kubavin Fine Wool Factory in the Moscow region, initiated a movement to unearth new potential forces for production in 1952. This movement guided workers to fully utilize their wisdom and further explore production potential from all aspects, replacing old movements and indicators with new ones. This initiative received widespread response. In January 1952, at the initiative of the employees of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, a nationwide "Movement to Reduce Metal Consumption in Every Product" was launched. Later, technicians from the Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in the Stalin region initiated the "Movement to Shorten Production Cycles," enabling several operations to proceed simultaneously, reducing workers' labor, and increasing labor productivity.

    During the "May Day" International Labor Day competition, innovators from the Moscow Ilyich Factory initiated a movement to save electricity and fuel in every operation. Steelworkers in Magnitogorsk conducted a competition to reduce production costs. The experience of mobilizing the masses to inspect operational accuracy to improve product quality at the Moscow "Red Dressmaker" Factory was also promoted. Regarding the movement to combine science and production, last year saw the emergence of a new form: scientific and technological conferences jointly organized by scientists and workers. In terms of saving fuel and electricity, rationalization proposals were made to strive for comprehensive savings of fuel and electricity. In the steelmaking industry, under the initiative of Yakimenko, a steelworker from the Zaporozhye Steel Plant in Ukraine, a comprehensive movement to strive for high-speed steelmaking was launched. In the days leading up to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the October Revolution Day, a competition movement emerged to complete the annual plan for 1952 ahead of schedule. In the competition to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan passed by the Party Congress ahead of schedule, various movements have further developed in various production indicators. Steelworkers from the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine Factory launched a competition to make fuller use of existing equipment and complete the new Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The Trudovskaya mine in the Donbas mining area launched a competition to reach the mine's planned production capacity one year ahead of schedule, exceed production quotas, increase labor productivity, and reduce production costs. Workers at the Sinarsky Pipe Plant in the Urals guaranteed that all workers would become rationalization proposers. Metal cutting workers from the Moscow "Red Proletarian" Factory put forward a new initiative to strive for shortening the production cycle, to better use the factory's fixed and working capital, reduce the amount of labor required for finished products, and shorten the overall processing cycle of parts by reducing auxiliary operations and other methods. Female workers from the Lenin Fine Wool Textile Factory in the Moscow region launched a socialist competition to improve product quality, striving to increase the production target for first-class products to 99.9%, eliminate third-class products, and reduce losses caused by the reduction of cargo quality to one ten-thousandth of the total cost of the product. Construction workers launched a competition to complete the labor productivity task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These new movements, as well as the original various socialist competition movements, have played a very significant role in promoting production.

    Last year, approximately 800,000 inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals were adopted in Soviet industry, construction, and transportation. Smirnov, an assembly worker at the Leningrad Electrical Equipment Factory, designed and improved fifteen types of machine tools and other machines in a few months. Lapin, a machine operator at the Yaroslavl Tire Factory, designed a rubber processing machine last year that increased labor productivity sixfold. In metal cutting, renowned turner Bykov, in November, performed the task of machining large cast iron pieces on a surface grinder at a spindle speed of 3,000 revolutions per minute, completing thirty quotas in one day. In the competition to complete the new Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, metal cutting workers in the first mechanical workshop of the Moscow "Red Proletarian" Factory halved the production cycle compared to the beginning of the year. In the steel industry, 90% of the steel produced by the Magnitogorsk factory during the "May Day" competition was made using rapid methods, with the average time per furnace reduced by thirty-five minutes. Later, steelworkers such as Dalibayev from the Kazakh steel plant further shortened the time per furnace by two to three hours using high-speed steelmaking methods, increasing the steel production per square meter of furnace bottom by one time. In the mining industry, more than 23,000 innovative suggestions were adopted in various mines last year. During the "May Day" competition, the monthly output of each combined machine at the "Polesayevskaya-1" mine in the Kuznetsk coal region in April was almost two and a half times the original quota, and the coal production of the entire mine reached more than twice the quota. The Tikhonov team of the mine mined 21,450 tons of coal in April, exceeding the previous Soviet record by 1,400 tons. In addition, the transportation industry and other fields also achieved brilliant results. In June last year, the continuous running mileage of Soviet freight locomotives increased by 18.5%. Advanced drivers continuously drive 1.5 million kilometers without major repairs. Locomotive drivers at the Leningrad Roundhouse alone saved about 100,000 rubles last year by reducing the total amount of repair work. Last year, Soviet locomotives hauled 40% more super-axle trains than the previous year, carrying 60% more cargo than the previous year. This saved the country a large amount of wealth.

    This year, the Soviet working class continues to put forward many new initiatives and rationalization proposals in striving for greater achievements in various production indicators. Employees of the Donbas New Kramatorsk Machine Building Plant launched a competition to reduce the weight of machines and improve the quality of machines. Va. Kolesov, a turner at the Kuibyshev Mid-Volga Machine Tool Plant, created a new method of working with lathe tools that can speed up ordinary lathe cutting operations by three to eleven times. An. Nefedova, a female worker at the Moscow "Liberated Labor" Fine Wool Factory, created a new wool weaving method that greatly reduced wool consumption. This year, many inventors and innovators have emerged in the Soviet Union. In the first two months of this year, the staff of the Minsk Automobile Factory put forward about 350 suggestions, the adoption of which can save 500,000 rubles a year. Innovators at the Moscow "Red Proletarian" Factory and the Taganrog "Red Boiler Worker" Factory also each put forward 200 suggestions in these two months. In Kramatorsk, in the Donbas, one in ten workers at the Stalin Machine Building Plant has put forward innovative suggestions. It is estimated that the adoption of the suggestions put forward in January this year alone can save 2 million rubles per year. After the death of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet workers responded to the call of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government, turning grief into strength, and a new wave of labor has formed. The socialist competition that has spread across the country to over fulfill the five-year plan tasks under the existing conditions without increasing raw materials and equipment was launched at this time. Now, Soviet workers are launching this year's "May Day" competition with new strength. They will achieve greater victories.

    为完成和超额完成第五个五年计划而斗争
    苏联工人在增产节约上成就很大
    【新华社二十六日讯】苏联工人阶级一年来充分发挥积极性和创造性，进行各种社会主义劳动竞赛，已经在增产节约上获得了很大的成就。
      一九五二年，苏联工人阶级在新的更高的水平上进行社会主义竞赛。竞赛参加者不以超额完成生产任务为满足，而努力在生产的各种指标上争取更大的成就。早在一九五二年年初，莫斯科州库巴维因细绒工厂著名斯大哈诺夫式工作者罗日聂娃和柯诺年科就发起了为一九五二年生产发掘新潜在力量的运动。这个运动引导工人们充分运用智慧，从各方面进一步发掘生产潜力，使新的运动和指标代替旧的运动和指标，这一倡议得到普遍的响应。一九五二年一月间，在莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂职工的创议下，苏联全国各地又展开了“在每一个产品上减低金属的消耗运动”。以后，斯大林州克拉马托尔斯克重型机器制造厂的技师又发起了“缩短生产周期的运动”，使若干操作同时并进，减轻工人劳动，提高工人劳动生产率。
    在“五一”国际劳动节竞赛期间，莫斯科伊里奇工厂革新者发起了在每一个操作上节约电力和燃料的运动；马格尼托哥尔斯克炼钢工人进行了缩减生产费的竞赛；莫斯科“红色女裁缝”工厂发动群众检查操作正确性以提高产品质量的经验也得到了推广。在科学和生产相结合的运动方面，去年出现了由科学家和工人共同组织科学技术会议的新形式。在节约燃料电力方面，产生了争取全盘节省燃料和电力的合理化建议。在炼钢工业方面，在乌克兰萨波罗什炼钢厂炼钢工人雅基曼科的倡议下，展开了全面争取高速炼钢运动。在迎接苏联共产党第十九次代表大会和十月革命节的日子里，又出现了为提前完成一九五二年全年计划的竞赛运动。在为提前完成党代表大会通过的第五个五年计划而展开的竞赛中，各种运动又在各种生产指标方面进一步发展了。马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂的炼钢工人发起了更充分使用现有设备、提前完成新五年计划的竞赛；顿巴斯矿区特鲁多夫斯卡雅矿场发起竞赛，争取提前一年达到矿场预定生产能力、超过生产定额、提高劳动生产率、减低生产成本。乌拉尔的辛纳尔斯基制管厂工人则保证使全体工人都要成为合理化建议人。莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂金属切削工人提出了争取缩短生产周期的新创议，要更好地使用工厂的固定资金和流动资金、减低成品所需劳动量、以减少辅助操作及其他方法来缩短制件加工总周期。莫斯科州列宁细呢绒纺织厂的女工发起了提高产品质量的社会主义竞赛，要争取把一等产品的生产指标提高到百分之九十九点九，消灭三等产品，把因货物质量的降低，而造成的损失减低到产品总成本的万分之一。建筑工人则发起了提前完成五年计划所规定的劳动生产率任务的竞赛。这些新运动以及原有的各种社会主义竞赛运动在推动生产前进方面发挥了非常巨大的作用。
    去年苏联工业、建筑业和运输业方面约采用了八十万件发明、技术改良和合理化建议。列宁格勒电工器材厂的装配工人斯米尔诺夫在几个月中就设计和改进了十五种工作母机和其他机器。雅罗斯拉夫车胎工厂机器操使者拉平去年设计的橡胶加工机器把劳动生产率提高了六倍。在金属切削方面，著名车工比科夫在十一月间以主轴每分钟转三千次的速度在平面磨床上进行大件铸铁加工的任务，一天之内完成了三十个定额。在争取提前完成新五年计划竞赛运动中，莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂第一机械车间金属切削工人把生产周期比年初缩短了一半。在钢铁工业方面，马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂在“五一”竞赛中所出的钢已有百分之九十是用快速方法炼的，每炉时间平均缩短了三十五分钟。后来，哈萨克炼钢工人达里巴耶夫等更利用高速炼钢法把每炉时间缩短两三小时，使每平方公尺炉底产钢量增加了一倍。采矿工业方面，去年各矿场采用了二万三千多项革新建议。在“五一”竞赛期间，库兹涅茨克煤区“波莱萨耶夫斯卡雅——一”矿场每部联合机四月份产量几为原定额的两倍半，全矿场的煤产量达到了定额两倍多，而矿场的吉洪诺夫小组则在四月份采煤二万一千四百五十吨，超过过去的全苏最高纪录一千四百吨。此外，运输业等方面也获得了辉煌成就。去年六月间苏联的货车机车连续行车里数就延长了百分之十八点五。先进驾驶员连续行车一百五十万公里而不要大修。单列宁格勒圆形机车库的机车驾驶员们去年就由于减少修理工作总量而节约了十万卢布左右。去年苏联机车牵引的超轴列车比前年多百分之四十，装运的货物比前年多百分之六十。这样就给国家节约了大量财富。
    今年，苏联工人阶级在争取各种生产指标的更大成就方面继续提出许多新的创议和合理化建议。顿巴斯新克拉马托尔斯克机器制造厂的职工发起了争取减轻机器重量和提高机器质量的竞赛运动。古比雪夫中伏尔加母机制造厂车工瓦·科列索夫创造了使用新式车刀工作法使普通车床切削操作可加快三倍到十一倍。莫斯科“解放了的劳动”精细呢绒工厂女工安·涅费多娃创造了一种新织毛工作法，大大减少了羊毛消耗量。今年苏联又涌现出许多发明家和革新者。在今年头两个月中，明斯克汽车工厂的工作人员提出了约三百五十项建议，采用这些建议
    一年可节省五十万卢布。莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂和塔干洛格“红色锅炉工人”工厂的革新者们在这两个月中也各提出了二百项建议。在顿巴斯的克拉马托尔斯克，斯大林机器制造厂中每十个工人就有一个提出了革新建议，据估计单是采用今年一月份提出的建议，每年就可节省两百万卢布。在斯大林同志逝世以后，苏联的工人响应苏联共产党和政府的号召，化悲痛为力量，已形成了一个新的劳动热潮。传遍全国的按现有条件不增加原料和器材而超额完成五年计划任务的社会主义竞赛就是这个时候展开的。现在，苏联工人又以新的力量展开今年的“五一”竞赛了。他们将获得更大的胜利。
