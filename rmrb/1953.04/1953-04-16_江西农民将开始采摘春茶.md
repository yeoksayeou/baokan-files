Jiangnan has entered the tea-picking season, and peasants in the tea-producing areas of Jiangxi Province are about to begin picking spring tea.

This year, Jiangxi Province's tea production focuses on improving quality and increasing the output of high-grade tea. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the international market, the black tea produced in the Hekou tea area of ​​the province will be converted into green tea. In order to guide tea-picking peasants to improve the quality of tea, the leading organs of Jiangxi Province held representative conferences and training courses for tea-picking peasants in various tea-producing areas in March this year to study tea-picking techniques and crude processing methods. For the Hekou tea area, which needs to be converted to green tea this year, more than 300 technicians and students were transferred from various tea factories and tea vocational schools to help the tea-picking peasants in the area to carry out the conversion work.

    江西农民将开始采摘春茶
    江南采茶季节已到，江西省产茶区的农民即将开始采摘春茶。
    今年江西省的茶叶生产着重在提高品质，增加高级茶的产量。同时为了适应国际市场需要，该省河口茶区所产的红茶将改制为绿茶。为了指导采茶农民提高茶叶品质，今年三月间，江西省领导机关在各产茶区分别举行了采茶农民的代表会议和训练班，研究采茶技术及粗制方法。对今年需要改制绿茶的河口茶区，还从各茶厂和茶业职业学校中，抽调了三百多个技术工人和学生帮助该地采茶农民进行改制工作。（新华社）
