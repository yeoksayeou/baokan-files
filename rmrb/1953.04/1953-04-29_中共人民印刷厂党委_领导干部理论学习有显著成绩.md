The CCP Committee of the People's Printing Factory regards the theoretical learning of leading cadres as one of the Party's important tasks. It has strengthened its leadership over cadres' theoretical learning ideologically, organizationally, and theoretically. As a result, the factory's cadres have achieved remarkable gains in their studies.

The factory's theoretical learning for cadres was formally organized in August of last year, with 180 students in the intermediate class and 700 students in the elementary class. They studied "Political Common Sense," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

After the study, the ideological and professional levels of the factory's cadres have improved significantly. Many cadres criticized subjectivism in their methods of thinking and attached importance to investigation and research. Leading cadres, paying attention to in-depth research on problems in their work and learning how to analyze contradictions and concentrate their efforts on solving major contradictions, have begun to change their bureaucratic style of work. For example, Li Qingtang, the head of the Production Section, used to handle even the smallest things himself, such as getting pen nibs and chairs, which made him extremely busy. After studying "On Contradiction," he was able to concentrate his energy on studying production organization and technical problems. Because they personally experienced that studying theory was of great help in improving their thinking and improving their professional work, the vast majority of cadres maintained full enthusiasm for learning and studied the documents of the 19th Congress of the CPSU. During the learning process, the factory’s work was examined according to the spirit of Comrade Malenkov’s report. They further recognized the importance of improving labor productivity and criticized the conservative idea of only considering the gains and losses of their own production unit when making plans, rather than formulating advanced norms from the perspective of the country's maximum benefit. They overcame the past phenomenon of emphasizing difficulties and demanding a reduction in plans and production targets when making plans. When formulating plans this year, all kinds of production were based on advanced norms, so that the new plans exceeded previous conservative standards, and even exceeded the standards proposed by the factory.

The reason why the factory's cadres' learning has been fruitful is that the factory's Party committee has strengthened its ideological leadership over the cadres' theoretical learning. When organizing learning and implementing learning plans, they always paid attention to understanding and timely resolving the ideological obstacles of cadres in theoretical learning. For example, when the factory first organized learning, many veteran cadres either underestimated theoretical learning and couldn't settle down, or were eager for quick success and hoped to solve many problems at once. New cadres were mainly fond of being ambitious and unrealistic, with an insincere attitude towards learning, wanting to take "shortcuts." The factory's Party committee immediately addressed these ideological situations, explaining to the cadres that theoretical learning is an important factor in improving work, and that theoretical learning must be diligently studied and adhered to for a long time to have good results. This initially corrected the cadres' erroneous ideas about theoretical learning. When some veteran cadres in the intermediate class showed signs of relaxation in their learning, the factory's Party committee, based on the People's Daily editorial "We Must Attach Importance to the Theoretical Learning of Senior Cadres" and the learning experience of the Northeast Industrial Department, conducted a special rectification on the issue of learning attitude. All section-level cadres in the factory, under the leadership of the general branch secretaries, focused on examining the following two questions: (1) How to understand the relationship between learning and work? (2) Have you made a conscious and serious study of theory? Through this inspection, the ideological problems of section-level cadres were basically resolved. Under the specific leadership of the core group, they all studied earnestly, and the situation of not being down-to-earth and unsettled was basically eliminated. The phenomenon of some section chiefs occupying study time to arrange work no longer existed. Under the influence and promotion of these veteran cadres, the learning of the intermediate and elementary classes also showed a new atmosphere.

Secondly, the factory's Party committee also adopted a series of specific measures in organizational leadership to ensure the regular conduct of learning. The factory is characterized by tight time and heavy tasks, therefore, the leadership must make appropriate arrangements for learning time. To this end, in addition to clearly stipulating that the theoretical learning time for cadres in the intermediate and elementary classes is four hours per week (more for the core group), the factory's Party committee also scheduled each learning time on the weekly spare time activity schedule, which may not be occupied without the approval of the class leader or the core group leader (the core group leader is the Party Committee Secretary, and the intermediate class leader is generally the Party General Branch Secretary). In terms of organizational leadership, the factory's Party committee also made clear provisions on the responsibilities of Party organizations at all levels for cadres' theoretical learning, namely: (1) The Party committee is responsible for formulating the factory's theoretical learning plan, supervising and inspecting the learning of the core group, and being responsible for the theoretical guidance of the instructors of the intermediate class and the theoretical teachers of the elementary class. (2) The General Branch regularly supervises and inspects the learning of cadres in the intermediate class, especially the learning of section-level cadres. The General Branch Committee should regularly study learning issues, focusing on solving ideological obstacles, correcting learning attitudes, and checking learning effects, and providing theoretical and methodological guidance to everyone's learning as much as possible. In addition, it is also responsible for equipping and adjusting learning backbones. (3) The branch's responsibilities are to implement the attendance system and solve ideological problems, and to regularly study various problems that occur in learning at the branch committee, and to commend those with excellent learning results and criticize those who do not value learning at the branch meeting. (4) Group life should take checking learning attitudes as an important content.

In addition, the Party committee also made clear provisions on the responsibilities of the class leaders, instructors, and group leaders of the intermediate and elementary classes. The Party committee also set out specific requirements for the learning of leading cadres: the General Branch Secretary (generally the class leader) submits learning notes to the Party committee once a month; section-level cadres report their learning situation to the General Branch once regularly. In this way, with learning time, strict systems, responsible cadres, and the help and supervision of Party organizations, regular theoretical learning for cadres is guaranteed.

Thirdly, in terms of theoretical guidance, the factory's Party committee has also established the following system: the Party Committee Secretary or a member of the Party Committee presides over the "classroom discussion" of the intermediate class, and the Party Committee Propaganda Department organizes and specifically leads the preparation work of the theoretical teachers of the elementary class. For the instructors of the elementary class, the Party committee designated a theoretical teacher to specifically responsible for the guidance work. Before each "classroom discussion" of the elementary class, the Party committee must convene a meeting of instructors and class leaders to conduct a detailed explanation on the main problems to be solved in the "classroom discussion," the possible disputes, how to make a conclusion, and the main points of the conclusion. Because the factory's Party committee paid attention to the theoretical guidance work of the cadres' learning, the instructors had a solid understanding, and the "classroom discussion" was warmly welcomed by the vast number of cadres. Cadres in the elementary class reported one after another: "Classroom discussion solves many problems," "You can learn a lot of new things in classroom discussion," "Participating in classroom discussion is like attending another class."

    中共人民印刷厂党委
    领导干部理论学习有显著成绩
    中共人民印刷厂党委将领导干部理论学习视为党的重要工作之一，从思想上、组织上和理论指导上加强了对干部理论学习的领导，因而该厂的干部学习有显著的收获。
    该厂干部的理论学习于去年八月即正式组织起来，参加学习的有中级班学员一百八十名，初级班学员七百名；曾进行了“政治常识”、“实践论”、“矛盾论”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件的学习。
    经过学习以后，该厂干部的思想、业务水平都有了比较显著的提高。许多干部批判了思想方法上的主观主义，重视了调查研究。领导干部由于注意深入重点研究工作中的问题，学会了分析矛盾、集中力量解决主要矛盾的方法，初步改变了事务主义的工作作风。如该厂生产科科长李庆堂过去连领钢笔尖、椅子也要自己经手，以致工作非常忙乱；学习“矛盾论”以后他已能集中精力去研究生产组织与技术上的问题。由于亲身体验到学习理论对提高思想、改进业务有很大帮助，绝大多数的干部都保持着饱满的学习情绪，进行了联共第十九次代表大会文件的学习。在学习过程中，曾根据马林科夫同志报告的精神，检查了该厂的工作，进一步认识到提高劳动生产率的重要，批判了订计划时只考虑本生产单位的得失，而不从国家最大利益出发来制定先进定额的保守思想。克服了过去各种在订计划时强调困难，要求降低计划和生产指标的现象。在今年制定计划时，各种生产都根据先进的定额，使新的计划都超过了以往的保守标准，甚至超过了厂方所提出的标准。
    该厂干部学习之所以有收获，是因为该厂党委加强了对干部理论学习的思想领导。他们在组织学习和贯彻学习计划时，都注意经常了解与及时解决干部进行理论学习中的思想障碍。如在该厂开始组织学习时，许多老干部，不是轻视理论学习，安不下心；就是急于求成，希望一下子解决很多问题。新干部则主要是好高骛远，不切实际，学习态度不老实，想走“捷径”。该厂党委即针对这些思想情况，向干部说明理论学习是改进工作的重要因素，学习理论必须刻苦钻研、长期坚持，才会有好的效果。这样便初步纠正了干部对理论学习的错误思想。当中级班某些老干部对学习有松懈现象时，该厂党委便根据人民日报“必须重视高级干部的理论学习”的社论和东北工业部的学习经验，专门就学习态度问题进行了一次整顿。该厂所有科长级干部都在各总支书记的领导下，重点检查了以下两个问题：（一）如何认识学习与工作的关系？（二）自己对理论学习是否作到了自觉的认真钻研？通过这一检查，科长级干部的思想问题基本上解决了。他们在核心组的具体领导下，都认真学习，不踏实、不安心的情况基本上消除了。有些科长侵占学习时间布置工作的现象也不复存在了。就在这批老干部的影响和推动下，中、初级班的学习也出现了新的气象。
    其次，该厂党委在组织领导上也采取了一系列的具体办法，以保证学习的经常进行。时间紧、任务多是工厂的特点，因此，领导方面必须对学习时间予以适当的安排。为此，该厂党委除明确规定中、初级班干部每周理论学习时间为四小时（核心组较多）外，并将每次学习的时间排于每周业余活动的时间表上，非经班长或核心组长（核心组长为党委书记，中级班班长一般为党总支书记）批准不得侵占。在组织领导上，该厂党委就各级党组织对干部理论学习应负的责任，也作了明确规定，即：（一）党委负责制定全厂的理论学习计划，督促检查核心组的学习，负责中级班辅导员、初级班理论教员的理论指导。（二）总支经常督促、检查中级班干部的学习，特别是科长级干部的学习。总支委员会要定期研究学习问题，着重注意解决思想障碍、端正学习态度、检查学习效果，并尽可能对大家的学习进行理论上和学习方法上的指导。此外，还要负责配备和调整学习骨干。（三）支部的职责是执行考勤制度和解决思想问题，同时也要定期在支部委员会上研究学习中发生的各种问题，在支部大会上对学习成绩优良者进行表扬，对不重视学习者进行批评。（四）小组生活应该把检查学习态度作为重要内容之一。
    另外，对中、初级班的班长、辅导员、组长的职责，党委也作了明确规定。对于领导干部的学习，党委也订出了具体要求：总支书记（一般均任班长）每月向党委交学习笔记一次；科长级干部定期向总支汇报一次自己的学习情况。这样，有学习时间，有严格制度，有负责干部及党组织的帮助、督促，进行经常的干部理论学习就有了保证。
    其三，在理论指导上，该厂党委还建立了如下制度：党委书记或党委委员主持中级班的“课堂讨论”，党委宣传部组织并具体领导初级班理论教员的备课工作。对初级班辅导员，党委则指定一理论教员专门负责辅导工作。初级班每次“课堂讨论”前，党委须召集辅导员和班长会议，就“课堂讨论”要解决的主要问题、可能引起的争论、如何作结论以及结论的要点等，进行详细的讲解。由于该厂党委注意了干部学习的理论指导工作，辅导员心里有底了，“课堂讨论”便受到广大干部的热烈欢迎。初级班干部纷纷反映说：“课堂讨论很解决问题”，“课堂讨论中可学到许多新东西”，“参加课堂讨论好像又上了一次课”。
