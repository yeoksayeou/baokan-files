Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 19th: The East-West European trade conference opened in Geneva on April 13 and is continuing. Trade experts from the governments of twenty-six countries are attending the conference, including those from Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, and the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic. The conference mainly discusses the issue of restoring and expanding trade between Eastern and Western Europe.

According to a Reuters dispatch from Geneva, during the first phase of the conference, trade experts from various countries made general reports on the export and import possibilities of their respective countries. This phase ended on the 15th. The second phase of the conference began on the 16th, with trade experts from various countries holding bilateral or trilateral negotiations to specifically discuss trade proposals, requirements, and commodity issues. An April 18th Reuters dispatch stated that the conference had made extremely satisfactory progress.

This East-West European trade conference was convened by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe, Gunnar Myrdal, suggested holding the East-West European trade conference as early as last year. However, the American ruling clique, which prohibits Western European countries from trading with Eastern Europe, tried its best to prevent the convening of this conference through its servant, Trygve Lie, causing the conference to fail to be held as scheduled.

However, Western European countries, whose economic situation is deteriorating, insisted on holding this conference despite American pressure. At the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe meeting held in March this year, a resolution to hold the East-West European trade conference was passed at the proposal of the French representative.

    讨论恢复和扩大东西欧贸易问题东西欧贸易会议在日内瓦举行
    【新华社十九日讯】日内瓦消息：东西欧贸易会议于四月十三日在日内瓦开幕，目前正在继续举行中。出席这次会议的有二十六个国家政府的贸易专家，其中包括英国、法国、意大利、比利时、瑞典、奥地利以及苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国等国政府的贸易专家。会议主要讨论恢复和扩大东西欧贸易问题。
    据路透社日内瓦消息说，在会议第一阶段中，各国贸易专家作了关于本国出口和进口的可能性的一般报告。这一阶段已在十五日结束。十六日开始会议的第二阶段，各国贸易专家分别举行双边或三角谈判，具体讨论贸易建议和要求以及贸易的货物问题。路透社十八日消息说，会议已获得极其令人满意的进展。
    这次东西欧贸易会议是联合国欧洲经济委员会召集的。欧洲经济委员会执行秘书密达尔在去年即建议在去年底召开东西欧贸易会议。然而，禁止西欧各国与东欧贸易的美国统治集团，通过其奴仆赖伊，竭力阻止这个会议的召开，使会议未能如期举行。
    但是，经济情况愈来愈恶化的西欧各国不顾美国的压力，仍然坚持要举行这个会议。在今年三月举行的联合国欧洲经济委员会会议上，在法国代表提议下，通过了举行东西欧贸易会议的决议。
