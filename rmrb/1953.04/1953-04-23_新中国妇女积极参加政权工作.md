    Women in New China Actively Participate in Political Work
    Women in New China actively participate in political work, and they competently manage state affairs.
    Women participate in work from grassroots political institutions all the way up to the Central People's Government. Throughout the country, many women serve as village chiefs, township heads, and district heads. There are also many who hold positions as county heads, presidents of county people's courts, and other important jobs, and the number is increasing year by year. According to incomplete statistics from the North China region: in 1951, there were 7 female county heads and deputy county heads, which increased to 51 in 1952. Among the presidents of courts in provinces, special districts, and counties under the jurisdiction of the entire region, there were 144 female presidents and vice-presidents. In the major administrative regions, provinces, and cities across the country, some women also hold positions such as vice-chairpersons of provincial people's governments, commissioners, and department heads. In the Central People's Government, there are more than 60 women serving as vice-chairpersons, ministers, vice-ministers, bureau directors, deputy bureau directors, and division chiefs.
    The number of women representatives in people's representative conferences at all levels is even greater and increases year by year. According to incomplete statistics from several regions, female representatives in county people's representative conferences accounted for about 10 percent of the total number of representatives in 1950, increasing to 15 percent in 1952. In grassroots political institutions in rural areas, the proportion of female representatives is even greater. In 1952, female representatives in township people's representative conferences (including peasant representative conferences exercising the functions of township people's representative conferences) accounted for 22 percent of the total number of representatives. The number of women representatives in urban grassroots political institutions is also increasing year by year. Taking Beijing as an example, female representatives in people's representative conferences of all sectors in the districts of Beijing accounted for 13.9 percent of the total number of representatives in 1950, increasing to 24.7 percent in 1952. Women of all ethnic minorities across the country are also actively participating in democratic political construction. In 1952, there were 300 female representatives of all ethnic groups in the people's representative conferences of all sectors in various counties of Xinjiang Province. Some ethnic minority women also became township heads, deputy township heads, district heads, and county heads.
    Women participating in political work are generally very active, can correctly implement government laws and policies, and demonstrate the high enthusiasm of New China's women for serving the people and their ability to manage state affairs. Tian Yun, the female county head of Shulu County, Hebei Province, came from a peasant background and was elected as county head by the people of the county in the winter of 1951. After taking office as county head, she always listened to the opinions of the masses with an open mind and strived to study policies. She spent her days handling government affairs and often studied late into the night. Because the county had a lot of dry land and few livestock, she came up with various ways to lead the peasants to organize and overcome difficulties in production. Through her efforts and the efforts of all the working cadres and peasants in the county, by the end of November last year, 79.8 percent of the labor force in the county had been organized, and 80 percent of the women had participated in agricultural labor. Last autumn, the county suffered a prolonged drought. In order to overcome the drought, she led all the cadres in the county to go to the countryside to mobilize the masses to apply water and plant wheat. In a very short period of time, the county completed the planting of more than 210,000 mu of wheat, ensuring the harvest. Cha Shibao, a representative to the first session of the second People's Congress of Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, is a female worker at the city's state-owned silk spinning factory. Because she led her group to excellently complete production tasks in the patriotic production emulation campaign, won three red flags, and was elected by the workers of the entire factory as a representative to the city's People's Congress. At the representative conference, she carefully reviewed the government's work report, criticized the bad work styles of staff in some state-owned enterprises, thereby examining the ideological leadership of the municipal government over the staff of state-owned enterprises in the city, and put forward suggestions for improvement. Cha Shibao's spirit of responsibility was praised by the representatives. Therefore, she was elected as a member of the Municipal People's Government.
    Women participating in political work are mostly able to maintain good contact with the masses, especially with women. They often pay attention to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women, and mobilize and organize the broad masses of working women to participate in the country's various construction projects. Qin Bagu, a model township head in Guangxi Province, is usually very concerned about the lives of the masses, often conveying the decisions of the higher-level government to the masses seriously, and at the same time widely soliciting the opinions of the masses. After returning from the second People's Congress of Guangxi Province, she conveyed it to the masses three times, solicited their opinions on various government measures, and reported to the Provincial People's Government five times. The Provincial People's Government replied to her six times, solving the problems and requests raised by the masses. Xue Guichen, a representative to the People's Congress of Hebei Province, used vivid examples to illustrate the importance of mobilizing women to participate in industrial and agricultural production when discussing production issues at the representative conference, and reported on the serious impact of women's lack of freedom in marriage and maltreatment on production, which attracted the attention of all representatives. Therefore, a resolution on mobilizing women to participate in production and implementing the Marriage Law was adopted at the conference, promoting industrial and agricultural production and women's work throughout the province. Luo Chongyun, the township head of Daxin Township, Xinhua County, Hunan Province, has resolved 44 women's issues in connection with various movements during her two years as township head, guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of women. In the 1952 production increase campaign, Luo Chongyun mobilized women to participate in various production jobs. Because the women of the entire township actively participated in production alongside the men, not only did the township achieve a bumper harvest, but the social and family status of women gradually improved.

    新中国妇女积极参加政权工作
    新中国的妇女们积极地参加政权工作，她们都称职地管理着国家事务。
    从基层政权机构一直到中央人民政府，都有妇女参加工作。全国有很多妇女担任村长、乡长和区长，担任县长、县人民法院院长以及其他重要工作的也不少，并且在逐年增加。据华北区不完全统计：一九五一年有女县长和女副县长七人，一九五二年增加到五十一人。全区所属省、专区、县的法院院长中有女院长和女副院长一百四十四人。在全国各大行政区、省、市中也有些妇女担任省人民政府副主席和专员、厅长等职务。在中央人民政府中妇女担任副主席、部长、副部长、局长、副局长、司长的共有六十余人。
    各级人民代表会议中的妇女代表人数更多，并且逐年增加。根据几个地区不完全的统计县各界人民代表会议中的女代表，一九五○年约占代表总数的百分之十，一九五二年增加到百分之十五。在农村基层政权中，妇女代表所占比例更大，一九五二年乡人民代表会议（包括执行乡人民代表会议职权的农民代表会议）中的女代表占代表总数的百分之二十二。城市基层政权的妇女代表也逐年增加。以北京市为例，一九五○年北京市各区的各界人民代表会议中女代表占代表总数的百分之十三点九，一九五二年增加到百分之二十四点七。全国各少数民族妇女也积极参加民主建政工作。一九五二年新疆省各县的各族各界人民代表会议中共有女代表三百人，有些少数民族妇女还当了乡长、副乡长、区长和县长。
    参加政权工作的妇女们，一般都很积极，能正确执行政府的法令和政策，表现出新中国妇女具有为人民服务的高度热诚和管理国家事务的才能。河北省束鹿县人民政府女县长田蕴是农民出身，在一九五一年冬天被该县人民选为县长。她担任县长后，凡事都虚心倾听群众意见，努力钻研政策。白天的时间处理政务，夜间往往学习到深夜。由于该县旱地多，牲畜少，她想出各种办法领导农民组织起来，克服了生产中的困难。经过她和全县工作干部、农民群众的努力，到去年十一月底，全县劳力组织起来的达百分之七十九点八，妇女参加农业劳动的已达百分之八十。去年秋天，该县久旱未雨。为战胜旱灾，她带领县里全体干部下乡发动群众施水点种麦子。在很短的时间内，全县完成种麦二十一万多亩。保证了收成。浙江省嘉兴市二届一次各界人民代表会议代表查时宝，是该市国营绢纺厂的女工。由于她在爱国生产竞赛运动中带领小组卓越地完成了生产任务，获得三次红旗，被全厂工人选举为市各界人民代表会议的代表。她在代表会议上认真审查了政府的工作报告，对于某些国营企业中工作人员的不良作风进行了批评，从而检查了市人民政府对该市国营企业工作人员的思想领导问题，并提出了改进意见。查时宝的这种认真负责的精神，受到代表们的称赞。因此被选为市人民政府委员。
    参加政权工作的妇女们，大都能够很好地联系群众，特别是和妇女群众有密切联系。她们经常注意保护妇女的合法权益，动员和组织广大劳动妇女参加祖国的各项建设工作。广西省模范乡长秦八姑，她平常十分关心群众生活，经常把上级政府的决议认真地向群众传达，同时又广泛地征求群众意见。她参加广西省第二次各界人民代表会议回来，曾向群众传达了三次，并征求群众对政府各项措施的意见，向省人民政府反映了五次，省人民政府给她复信六次，解决了群众提出的问题和要求。河北省各界人民代表会议代表薛贵臣，在代表会议讨论生产问题时，她以生动的事例说明发动妇女参加工业和农业生产的重要性，并报告了妇女因婚姻不自由、受虐待等原因而影响生产的严重情况，引起了全体代表们的注意。因此在大会上通过了发动妇女参加生产和贯彻婚姻法的决议，推动了全省的工业和农业生产及妇女工作。湖南省新化县大新乡乡长罗崇云，在她担任乡长的两年中，结合各种运动解决了有关的妇女问题四十四件，保障了妇女的合法权益。罗崇云在一九五二年增产运动中，发动妇女参加各种生产工作。由于全乡妇女和男人一道积极参加生产，不仅使该乡获得了丰收，而且妇女们在社会上和家庭里的地位也逐渐地提高了。
