How are we going to discuss the 1953 production plan?
Hua Ming, Acting General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

The 1953 production task of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is arduous and glorious. This year's total output value will increase by 27% compared to last year, labor productivity will increase by 12.88%, and costs will decrease by 12.24%. The output of several major products will also increase significantly compared to last year. In addition, 11,940 skilled workers will be trained, and 2,194 cadres will be trained and promoted in 1953.

This year is the first year of the national Five-Year Plan. The construction of various industries across the country (such as steel, machinery manufacturing, agricultural tool manufacturing, mining, military, forestry, wood processing, shipbuilding, chemical, electrical, power generation, textile, printing, petroleum, water conservancy, transportation, etc.) all require us to supply steel materials. In 1953, hundreds of units across the country placed orders with Anshan Iron and Steel. If our work is not done well, not only will Anshan Iron and Steel fail to complete its tasks, but it will also hinder the realization of the national large-scale economic construction plan. The total profit of Anshan Iron and Steel's production plants and mines this year is almost equal to the state's entire investment in Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction this year. If we can complete this plan, it will make a huge contribution to the country's large-scale economic construction, and the material life of all employees can also be further improved. After completing the above plan, the state will allocate enterprise reward funds to establish two sanatoriums, nine welfare canteens, four children's schools, two rest rooms, two cooperatives, thirteen bathhouses, four nurseries, and four clubs. In addition, the state plans to allocate part of the funds to repair 5,469 family dormitories, install gas for 1,350 households, repair 4,500 meters of sewers, repair nine bathhouses, ten canteens, one club, one barbershop, one cooperative, and one rest room. In terms of health care, it is planned to build a tuberculosis hospital with 200 beds, four clinics, nine health centers, and five maternal and child health stations, and to add 200 beds to the existing hospitals.

In order to ensure the completion of the 1953 national plan, we will launch a mass movement in all production plants and mines in April and May to discuss the plan. Through mass discussion of the plan, we will formulate an advanced and realistic production plan; at the same time, we will strengthen plan management with the implementation of the work plan as the center. The so-called advanced plan should be comprehensive, including output, quality, labor productivity, cost, and safety. At present, the quality of our products is not good enough, so this point will be emphasized during the discussion of the plan, so that our products are not only numerous but also good; and that labor productivity continues to increase and costs gradually decrease. Regarding plan management, we must mobilize the masses to discuss all quotas and turn backward quotas into advanced quotas; in addition, we must expand the scope of quotas, such as making quotas for the consumption of some auxiliary materials. After this rectification, we must strengthen the original record work, eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible and chaos, and do a good job in the various forms of the work plan.

Under the leadership of the Party and higher authorities, Anshan Iron and Steel has initially established a planning management system in recent years, and various plants and mines also have a foundation. The difference between the 1949 production plan and actual production was 45.2%, which was reduced to 22% in 1950, 21% in 1951, and 11.8% in 1952. Production has continued to increase, and production management has also gradually improved. There have also been some achievements in quotas. Major projects have quotas, which have played a controlling role in production, improved production, reduced consumption, and initially controlled labor productivity, and the work plan has begun to be established.

However, there are still many shortcomings in planning management work: (1) Production according to planned varieties is not done well, especially in terms of steelmaking plant producing steel according to the plan, which is very unsatisfactory. In January, 26.1% of the furnaces produced steel according to the original plan, only 25.1% in February, and only 46.5% in March; on average, only one-third of the furnaces produced steel according to the plan. Only 74% of tube billet steel and 68% of thin plate steel were completed. Therefore, the failure of the No. 2 Small Plant and the Steel Pipe Plant to complete the production plan has been seriously affected. (2) The work plan has not been universally implemented, and balanced production is very poor. For example, the medium plate plant failed to complete the daily production plan for 45 days in the first quarter. (3) The connection between production and sales supply is insufficient. In 1952, the sales task could not be completed due to failure to produce according to planned varieties, resulting in product backlog. The supply department sometimes does not supply raw materials to various plants and mines in a timely manner. The production department does not contact the supply department when production plans change, and various plants and mines do not use materials according to the plan. (4) The transportation plan is inaccurate. Production is constantly developing, and large-scale capital construction is underway, but the transportation work has not been well improved. Scheduling is not good, work is not carried out according to the transportation chart, and various plants and mines and capital construction units cannot implement the vehicle usage system well, and cannot make accurate transportation plans, which seriously affects production. (5) The planning of equipment maintenance is far behind the needs of production development. The major maintenance plan is not well understood, and many maintenance tasks are not carried out according to the plan. The time is prolonged during maintenance due to poor control. The spare parts management system is not sound, and major spare parts cannot be guaranteed to meet needs. The company has not unified the entire maintenance force and cannot give full play to the maintenance force. (6) The technical organization measures plan has not been carried out well. Last year, the company only completed 65.6% of the technical organization measures plan. This is because there is a lack of a serious attitude in formulating the plan, and the review is not thorough. Some plans are not checked after they are formulated, and there is a lack of preparation in material supply. (7) The original record work is very poor. The company and the leaders of various plants and mines do not pay enough attention to this work, and record personnel are transferred at will. For example, the ore dressing plant has 12 original record personnel, and 11 of them were transferred last year. (8) There are many shortcomings in terms of quotas, mainly the lack of a set of quota management system.

The ideological roots of these phenomena are: First, some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding that state-owned enterprises are an integral part of the entire national economic plan. Some people even have doubts about whether a plan is needed or whether the national plan is a law; some leading cadres do not have a clear understanding of the comprehensiveness of the plan, and only one-sidedly value output, and are very unconcerned about quality, variety, cost, production profit, and labor productivity. Second, there is conservative thinking among leading cadres. For example, some cadres are willing to set the output plan lower and the material consumption plan higher. They say: "Those who know how to plan always have some leeway in the plan." Third, some leading cadres do not fully realize that planning is the basic principle of enterprise management. Some units push the planning work to a few planning personnel, and each department does not assume its own responsibility in planning management. Some cadres do not realize that planning leadership is about leading cadres leading the masses to complete the plan according to the plan. Many plants and mines have not done enough in this regard.

We plan to do the following for the method and steps of this plan discussion: From April 7th to April 20th, cadres of various plants and mines will study documents; from April 21st to May 15th, the plan will be fully launched, and the masses will be mobilized to discuss the plan, discuss quotas, formulate guarantee plans, revise technical organization measures plans, and determine advanced experience promotion plans; from May 16th to the end of the month, the company will balance the production plans of various plants and mines, and then issue them to the plants and mines for execution. The best way to discuss the plan is this: (1) Conduct key experiments at each level to gain experience and promote it comprehensively. (2) The mass discussion of the plan should start with opposing waste in production, checking quotas, checking plans, and checking rationalization proposals. For the problems checked by the masses, after research by the workshop and work section, explain to the masses, formulate topics, and mobilize the masses to tap potential, find tricks, and propose rationalization proposals to solve them. (3) The discussion must be specific, practical, and guided to prevent laissez-faire. A specific technical organization measures plan and a comprehensive guarantee plan must be formulated. (4) Among all employees, focus on discussing quotas; in the company and relevant functional departments of plants and mines, focus on doing a good job in work plans and implementing balanced production according to the indicator chart. The factory and mine directors should personally preside over the work, with the planning and statistics departments as the center, and cooperate with various business departments to earnestly rectify the original records and eliminate irresponsible phenomena such as not recording, omissions, and inaccurate records.

    我们准备怎样讨论一九五三年的生产计划
    鞍山钢铁公司代理总经理  华明
    鞍山钢铁公司一九五三年的生产任务是艰巨而光荣的，今年的生产总值将比去年提高百分之二十七，劳动生产率将提高百分之十二点八八，成本将降低百分之十二点二四。几种主要产品的产量也比去年大大提高。此外，在一九五三年内还要培养技术工人一万一千九百四十名，培养与提拔干部二千
    一百九十四名。
    今年是国家五年建设计划开始的第一年，全国各地的各种工业（如钢铁、机械制造、农具制造、采矿、军事、森林、木材加工、造船、化学、电气、发电、纺织、印刷、石油、水力、交通等等）的建设都需要我们供给钢铁材料。一九五三年全国各地向鞍钢订货的达几百个单位，如果我们工作做得不好，不仅鞍钢不能完成任务，还将阻碍全国大规模经济建设计划的实现。鞍钢各生产厂矿今年生产的总利润，几乎等于今年国家为鞍钢基本建设的全部投资，如果我们能够完成这个计划，对国家大规模经济建设有巨大贡献，全体职工的物质生活也可进一步提高。在完成上述计划之后，国家即可拨给企业奖励资金建立两个休养所，九个福利食堂，四个子弟学校，两个休息室，两个合作社，十三个浴池，四个托儿所，四个俱乐部。除此而外，国家还计划拿出部分基金修理五千四百六十九户家属的宿舍，安装一千三百五十户使用的煤气，修理四千五百公尺下水道，修理九个浴池、十个食堂、一个俱乐部、一个理发馆、一个合作社、一个休息室。在卫生事业方面，计划修建一座有二百个床位的结核病院、四个门诊部、九个保健所、五个妇幼保健站，并在现有的病院里增加二百个床位。
    为了保证完成一九五三年的国家计划，在四、五两个月内，我们要在各生产厂矿普遍发动群众展开讨论计划的工作。通过群众讨论计划，订出一个先进而切合实际的生产计划；同时以贯彻作业计划为中心，加强计划管理。所谓先进计划，应该是全面的，即包括产量、质量、劳动生产率、成本和安全等方面。目前我们的产品质量是不够好的，因此这一点在讨论计划时准备强调提出，使我们的产品不仅多，而且好；并使劳动生产率不断提高，成本逐渐降低。关于计划管理方面，我们要发动群众讨论所有的定额，并将落后的定额变为先进的定额；另外将定额范围扩大一些，如一部分辅助材料消耗上也要做出定额。经过这次整顿，要加强原始纪录工作，消灭无人负责和混乱现象，搞好作业计划各种表格。
    鞍钢几年来在党和上级的领导下，已初步建立起来计划管理制度，各厂矿也有了基础。一九四九年生产计划与实际生产相差百分之四十五点二，一九五零年降低到百分之二十二，一九五一年降低到百分之二十一，一九五二年降低到百分之十一点八。生产不断提高，生产管理也在逐步改善。在定额方面也有些成绩，主要项目都有了定额，对生产起了控制作用，提高了生产，降低了消耗量，也初步控制了劳动生产效率，开始建立了作业计划。
    但是计划管理工作，现在还存在很多缺点：（一）按计划品种生产做得很不好，特别是炼钢厂按计划出钢方面，是很不能令人满意的。一月份有百分之二十六点一的炉数是按原来的计划出钢，二月份只有百分之二十五点一，三月份只有百分之四十六点五；平均只有三分之一的炉数是按计划出钢。管坯钢只完成百分之七十四，薄板钢只完成百分之六十八。因此严重地影响了二小型厂和钢管厂不能完成生产计划。（二）作业计划还没有普遍执行，均衡生产做得很差，如中板厂在第一季度中有四十五天没有完成日产量计划。（三）生产与推销供应衔接不够。一九五二年因为不按计划品种生产，使推销任务没能完成，造成产品积压。供应部门对各厂矿供应原材料有时不及时，生产部门在生产计划变更时不和供应部门联系，各厂矿不按计划用料。（四）运输计划不准确。生产不断发展，又大规模进行基本建设，但运输工作没有很好改善，调度不好，没有按运输图表进行工作，各厂矿与基本建设单位不能很好执行用车制度，做不出准确的运输计划，因此严重地影响了生产。（五）设备检修的计划性远远落后于生产发展的需要。对大检修计划掌握不够，有很多检修是不按计划执行的，在检修时由于掌握不好而延长了时间。备品管理制度不健全，主要备品不能保证需要。公司没有把整个检修力量统一掌握起来，不能充分发挥检修力量。（六）技术组织措施计划进行得不好，去年全公司只完成技术组织措施计划百分之六十五点六。这是因为在制订计划时缺乏认真态度，审查时也不周密，有些在订出后没有人检查，材料供应上缺乏准备。（七）原始纪录工作做得很差。公司与各厂矿领导上对这项工作是不够重视的，随便调动纪录人员，如选矿厂有十二个原始纪录人员，去年就调换了十一个。（八）在定额方面有很多缺点，主要是缺乏一套定额管理制度。
    产生这些现象的思想根源是：第一、有些干部对国营企业是整个国民经济计划的一环认识不足，甚至有的人对要不要做计划或国家计划是不是法律也抱着怀疑态度；有的领导干部对计划的全面性认识不清，只片面地重视产量，对于质量、品种、成本、生产利润、劳动生产率等很不关心。第二、在领导干部中存在着保守思想。如有的干部愿将产量计划订得低些，材料消耗计划订得高些。说什么：
  “会做计划的人，总得叫计划有些余头”。第三、有些领导干部没有足够地认识到计划是企业管理的基本原则。有些单位将计划工作推给少数计划人员去做，各个部门没有担负起本身在计划管理方面应负的责任。有些干部没有认识到计划领导是要领导干部按着计划去领导群众完成计划。很多厂矿在这一点上做得很不够。
    这次讨论计划的方法与步骤，我们准备这样做：由四月七日到四月二十日，各厂矿干部学习文件；四月二十一日到五月十五日，全面铺开，发动群众讨论计划，讨论定额，订出保证计划，修订技术组织措施计划，确定先进经验推广计划；五月十六日到月底由公司平衡各厂矿生产计划，然后发至厂矿执行。讨论计划时的方法最好是这样：（1）层层进行重点试验，取得经验全面推广。（2）群众讨论计划要从反对生产中的浪费，检查定额，检查计划，检查合理化建议开始。对群众检查的问题，经车间、工段研究，向群众交代，订出课题，发动群众挖潜力、找窍门、提合理化建议来解决。（3）必须具体切实地有领导地讨论，防止放任自流，必须订出具体的技术组织措施计划和全面的保证计划。（4）在全体职工中，以讨论定额为中心；在公司、厂矿有关职能机构，以做好作业计划、贯彻按指示图表进行均衡生产为中心。厂矿长要亲自主持，以计划、统计部门为中心，配合各业务部门，切实整顿原始纪录，消灭不记、漏记、记得不准等无人负责现象。
