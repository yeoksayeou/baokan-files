    The Hunan Provincial People's Government Should Investigate the Issue of Belated Distribution of Disaster Relief Cotton Clothing
    A letter from Changyuan and Lingkui of the CCP Daoxian County Committee, Hunan Province: In late February and early March of this year, the Civil Affairs Section of the Daoxian County People's Government received over two thousand pieces of cotton clothing for disaster relief from the Hunan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. If these cotton clothes had been sent before last winter, they would have greatly helped disaster victims solve the difficulty of lacking winter clothing at that time and would have been warmly supported by the vast number of disaster victims. Now that the severe winter season has passed and the weather is getting warmer, some people have already changed out of their cotton clothes, but the Hunan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has only just sent these cotton clothes. If the county distributes the cotton clothes to disaster victims now, the disaster victims simply do not need them. If they are used to solve the problem of winter clothing for disaster victims this winter, these cotton clothes will have to be stored for more than half a year, tying up the state's funds. This is not just a problem in Daoxian County; similar situations exist in other places as well. It is hoped that the Hunan Provincial People's Government will investigate the responsibility and improve future disaster relief work.

### 湖南省人民政府应该检查救灾棉衣发下过迟的问题

    湖南省人民政府应该检查救灾棉衣发下过迟的问题
    中共湖南省道县委员会长远、陵逵来信：今年二月下旬和三月上旬，道县人民政府民政科先后接到湖南省民政厅发来救济灾民的棉衣两千多件。这批棉衣如果在去年冬季以前发来，对帮助灾民解决当时缺乏冬衣的困难有很大好处，必将得到广大灾民的热烈拥护。现在严寒季节已过，天气渐暖，有些人已经换下棉衣了，但湖南省民政厅才把这批棉衣发来。如果县里再把棉衣发给灾民，灾民们目前根本用不着了。如果用来解决今冬灾民寒衣问题，这批棉衣就得存上大半年，积压了国家的资金。这不是道县一县的问题，其它地方也有类似情况。希望湖南省人民政府追究责任，并改进今后救灾工作。
