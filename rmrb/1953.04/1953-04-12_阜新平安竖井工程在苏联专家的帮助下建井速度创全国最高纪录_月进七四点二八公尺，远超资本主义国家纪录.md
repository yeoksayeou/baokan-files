    Fuxin Ping'an Shaft Project, Aided by Soviet Experts, Sets National Speed Record
    Monthly Progress Reaches 74.28 Meters, Far Surpassing Capitalist Countries' Records
    [Report from this newspaper] Basic construction workers of the Ping'an Shaft of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, with the help of Soviet experts, have created a new national record for shaft construction speed, reaching 74.28 meters per month (the previous national record, set by the Xi'an Coal Mine last year, was just over 56 meters per month). The increased construction speed will allow the shaft construction project to be completed three months ahead of schedule. The current construction speed of the Ping'an Shaft far exceeds the records of capitalist countries such as England and Japan, and is approaching the highest speed of shaft construction in the Soviet Union (the highest speed in the Soviet Union in 1952 was 72 meters per month, and it accelerated to 84 meters per month in 1953).
    The Ping'an Shaft project began in June of last year and is one of the modern mines under construction in our country. From design to construction, all adopt advanced Soviet technology and experience. After completion, mechanized coal mining will be implemented. At the beginning of the project, due to bureaucracy on the part of the leadership and failure to conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, a large amount of mechanical equipment, such as rock loaders and large buckets, transported from the Soviet Union were abandoned in the field without anyone paying attention. Workers had to use heavy shovels to load rock, resulting in a construction speed of only 20.7 meters per month. After the Gu Faming group, which had studied advanced Soviet shaft construction experience in Xi'an, came to work at the shaft, they launched a struggle against bureaucracy and conservative thinking, urging the leadership to quickly adopt mechanical equipment and sternly pointing out: "It is a crime to let advanced Soviet tools sit idle." However, this reasonable suggestion was not only not accepted, but Gu Faming himself was subjected to many attacks. For example, some leaders considered the Gu Faming group to be "mischievous," and when selecting models at the Youth League Congress, they said he "did not have good relations with the masses"; when selecting model party members, they said he "did not obey the leadership." Gu Faming was not discouraged by these blows and was determined to wage a struggle against conservative thinking. Therefore, he wrote to the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, requesting the Municipal Committee to support the opinions of their group. At this time, a Soviet expert came to Fuxin to inspect the wellhead and pointed out that mechanical equipment must be fully utilized, and proposed a target of 60 meters per month. With the support of the Municipal Committee, the Party General Branch widely launched criticism and self-criticism, criticized the erroneous ideas of not accepting advanced Soviet experience, and decided to fully support the opinions of the Gu Faming group. Due to the change in leadership cadres, Soviet machinery was quickly equipped at the wellhead, labor organization was improved, the coordination between the electromechanical department and the wellhead was strengthened, and a series of advanced technical measures proposed by Soviet expert Pustovidov, such as high-altitude wall seating and double-bucket hoisting, were adopted. By March 18, the first quarter's national plan had been overfulfilled. As of the 31st, the main shaft had completed 75.2 meters of rock drilling and 70.75 meters of wall construction, equivalent to 73.42 meters of shaft; the auxiliary shaft had completed 74 meters of rock drilling and 74.7 meters of wall construction, equivalent to 74.28 meters of shaft. The Fuxin Mining Bureau is actively preparing to celebrate this achievement.

    阜新平安竖井工程在苏联专家的帮助下建井速度创全国最高纪录
    月进七四点二八公尺，远超资本主义国家纪录
    【本报讯】阜新矿务局平安竖井基本建设职工，在苏联专家帮助下，创造了建井速度月进七十四点二八公尺的全国最高纪录（去年西安煤矿所创的全国最高纪录是月进五十六公尺多）。由于建井速度提高，将使该竖井建设工程提前三个月完成。目前平安竖井的建井速度已远远超过英、日等资本主义国家的纪录，并接近了苏联建井的最高速度（苏联一九五二年的最高速度为月进七十二公尺，一九五三年加速到月进八十四公尺）。
    平安竖井工程开始于去年六月，为我国正在建设的近代化矿井之一，从设计到施工，全部采用苏联的先进技术与经验，完工后将实行机械化采煤。该工程开始时，由于领导上存在官僚主义，对苏联专家建议不认真执行，使得由苏联运来的装岩机、大吊桶等大量机械设备弃置野外，无人过问，工人们只好使用笨重的铁锹装岩，致使建井速度每月只达二十点七公尺。曾在西安学习过苏联先进建井经验的谷发明小组来到竖井工作后，即与官僚主义、保守思想展开斗争，督促领导上迅速采用机械设备，并严正指出：叫苏联先进工具窝工就是犯罪。但是这一合理建议不但没被接受，谷发明本人反而受到许多打击。如有的领导人认为谷发明小组“调皮捣蛋”，在青年团代表大会上选模范时，则说他“和群众关系搞不好”；在选模范党员时，则说他“不服从领导”。谷发明并不因这些打击而灰心丧气，决心与保守思想展开斗争。因此他又给中共阜新市委写信，请求市委支持他们小组的意见。这时一位苏联专家来到阜新视察井口，又指出必须充分运用机械设备，并提出月进六十公尺的目标。在市委的支持下，党总支即广泛展开批评与自我批评，批判了不接受苏联先进经验的错误思想，并决定全力支持谷发明小组的意见。由于领导干部的转变，在井口迅速装备了苏联机械，改进了劳动组织，加强机电部门与井口的配合，又采用了苏联专家普斯多维多夫同志提出的高空打壁座、双吊筒提升等一系列先进技术措施。到三月十八日便超额完成了第一季度的国家计划。截至三十一日，主井完成凿岩七十五点二公尺，砌壁七十点七五公尺，折合成井七十三点四二公尺；副井完成凿岩七十四公尺，砌壁七十四点七公尺，折合成井七十四点二八公尺。阜新矿务局正积极筹备庆贺这一成就。
