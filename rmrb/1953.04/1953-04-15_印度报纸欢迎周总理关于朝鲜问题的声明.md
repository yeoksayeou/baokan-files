Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 14th: Indian newspapers generally welcome and support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean question.

	"Crossroads Weekly" said in an editorial: "Let millions of Indian people raise their voices to support this recently proposed peace suggestion." "Crossroads Weekly" said: "Peace-loving people all over the world welcome the new proposal made by the Chinese Premier regarding the solution of the prisoner-of-war issue, considering it a great initiative to promote the realization of peace in Korea. China has once again shown that it not only hopes but is also determined to promote world peace."

	"New Century" said in an editorial on April 2nd: "China has once again put forward a proposal to end the Korean War, and peace-loving and democratic people all over the world must agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's words: now is the time to resolve the issue of exchanging prisoners of war and thus end the Korean War." "New Century" pointed out: "The leaders of the Soviet Union and People's China oppose war, and in this step, they have put forward concrete proposals for maintaining world peace. The natural result of this proposal is that the war maniacs are becoming isolated from the people."

	"People's Report" said in its editorial: "The new proposal put forward by the Chinese Premier regarding ending the Korean War has once again brought hope to the world for the victorious completion of armistice negotiations and the cessation of bloodshed in Korea." The editorial continued: "The Chinese Premier's proposal has cleared the way for ending the Korean War. In this situation, the Chinese Premier has made the world situation more hopeful and created a suitable atmosphere, thereby making it possible to resume negotiations for the realization of peace." The editorial concluded: "It is believed that voices will be raised in every corner of the world to support this proposal. The people will certainly demand that this proposal be accepted and the Korean War be ended. The United States must agree to this demand, otherwise the United States will suffer the hatred of the world."

	The Bengali newspaper "Golden Age" in Calcutta said in an editorial: The Soviet Union and China have repeatedly put forward proposals for the peaceful resolution of all conflicts. Another Bengali newspaper in Calcutta, "World Daily," wrote: "If the United States hopes for peace, it can now easily achieve peace based on the Chinese Premier's proposal."

    印度报纸欢迎周总理关于朝鲜问题的声明
    【新华社新德里十四日电】印度各报普遍欢迎和支持周恩来总理关于朝鲜问题的声明。
  “十字路周报”在一篇社论中说：“让千百万印度人民发出呼声，来支持最近提出的这个和平建议。”“十字路周报”说：“全世界爱好和平的人类欢迎中国总理所提出的关于解决战俘问题的新建议，认为这是促进在朝鲜实现和平的一个伟大创议。中国再一次表明它不仅希望而且有决心来促进世界和平。”
    “新世纪报”在四月二日的一篇社论中说：“中国再一次提出了结束朝鲜战争的建议，全世界爱好和平和民主的人民一定同意周恩来总理所说的话：现在已是解决交换战俘问题从而结束朝鲜战争的时候了。”“新世纪报”指出：“苏联和人民中国的领袖们反对战争，他们在这一步骤上提出了维持世界和平的具体建议。这个建议的自然结果，是战争疯子们正在脱离人民而陷于孤立。”
    “人民报”在它的社论中说：“中国总理所提出的关于结束朝鲜战争的新建议，再度给全世界带来了胜利完成停战谈判和停止朝鲜流血的希望。”社论继续指出：“中国总理的建议为结束朝鲜战争扫清了道路。在这种情况下，中国总理已使世界情势更有希望，并造成了适宜的气氛，从而可以恢复实现和平的谈判。”社论最后说：“相信世界每一个角落将发出呼声，来支持这个建议。人民将一定要求接受这个建议和结束朝鲜战争。美国必须答应这个要求，否则美国就要遭受全世界的憎恨。”
    加尔各答孟加拉文报纸“黄金时代”报在社论中说：苏联和中国屡次提出和平解决所有冲突问题的建议。加尔各答另一家孟加拉文报纸“世界日报”写道：“如果美国希望和平的话，它现在根据中国总理的建议就能很容易地得到和平。”
