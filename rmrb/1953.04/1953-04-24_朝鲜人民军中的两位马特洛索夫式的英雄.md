In the battle to attack the enemy on Height 851 east of Mundengli on November 3 last year, two Matrosov-style heroes emerged from a certain unit of the Korean People's Army: Li Henghuan and Jin Renhuan.

At 9 p.m. that day, the troops launched an attack on Height 851, which was occupied by the enemy, under the cover of powerful artillery fire. After a small vanguard of assault troops rushed to the main peak, a few enemy fire points that had not been destroyed by the artillery suddenly came back to life. Three fire points on the front, left, and right sides of the main peak fired fiercely, and the follow-up troops were completely cut off on a mountain ridge behind the main peak. At this time, the few assault troops who had rushed to the main peak had engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, and the situation was extremely urgent. However, because the enemy's firepower was strong, especially the heavy machine gun in the rightmost fire point fired the most frantically, posing the greatest threat to the follow-up troops pinned down on the mountain ridge. The follow-up troops launched several charges, but were unable to reinforce the assault troops.

At this moment, Li Henghuan, an eighteen-year-old youth fighter and member of the Democratic Youth League, volunteered to quickly eliminate the fire point on the right. Braving the enemy's firepower, Li Henghuan bypassed the front of the fire point and approached it from the side. The enemy's fire point was built on a steep cliff more than ten feet high. Li Henghuan's comrades saw, by the light of flares, that Li Henghuan approached the fire point, slung his submachine gun over his arm, and climbed up, grabbing onto the rock crevices and thorns on the steep cliff. After Li Henghuan climbed up, he immediately threw a grenade at the fire point, but the grenade hit the barbed wire outside the fire point, shattering the barbed wire. It did not hit the fire point. Those behind saw Li Henghuan climb forward again and throw a second grenade, which happened to land on the fire point and exploded. The enemy's machine gun immediately fell silent. With a burst of "Manse (Long Live)" from the follow-up troops, they launched another charge. But in an instant, the enemy's heavy machine gun rang out again. The enemy's fire point had not been completely destroyed, and flames spewed out from the firing hole again, suppressing the charging troops on the hillside.

This was the key to the victory or defeat of the battle. If this fire point was not eliminated immediately, the attack would be frustrated. At that instant, by the flashing light of the enemy's machine gun, Li Henghuan's comrades saw Li Henghuan dart out from the side of the fire point and pounce on the firing hole as fast as lightning. The enemy's machine gun immediately went silent, and the troops stormed the main peak.

However, when the People's Army had largely occupied the hill and approached within only thirty or forty meters of the main peak, about to join up with the assault troops who had already rushed to the main peak, the surviving enemy, relying on the central fire point on the top of the main peak, made a desperate last struggle. The rain of bullets fired by a large-caliber machine gun in the enemy's fire point caused sparks to fly from the rocks on the hillside. The attack was blocked again.

At this time, a loud voice came from the loudspeaker on our own position: "For the motherland, for our parents and loved ones, take revenge on the American imperialists!..." At this moment, Jin Renhuan, a labor party member lying at the front, turned around and said to his comrades behind him: "Comrades, cover me, I'll go and eliminate this fire point!" His comrades covered him with fire. He held a submachine gun in his left hand and a grenade in his right, and crawled towards the fire point, propping himself up with his elbows. The hillside was uneven, and Jin Renhuan tried his best to use the depressions where the enemy could not easily see him to crawl upwards, but when he had to crawl over a relatively high earth bank, the enemy immediately fired a burst of machine gun at him. In the light of the flares, the comrades behind him watched him suddenly lower his head and stop moving. But when the enemy thought he had been killed and slightly shifted their fire, they saw him suddenly roll over the earth bank and continue to crawl laboriously towards the enemy's fire point. At this time, the comrades behind him all understood very well what this seriously wounded dear comrade was going to do? The eyes of the comrades were blurred with tears. Soon Jin Renhuan crawled to the front of the enemy's fire point, and then the red firing hole spitting fire suddenly went dark.

Jin Renhuan's comrades, lying behind him, charged bravely up the main peak with incomparable hatred, and joined up with the assault troops who had already rushed up, completely annihilating the remaining enemy. More than six hundred American soldiers were killed in this battle.

The next morning, Li Henghuan and Jin Renhuan's comrades found the bodies of the two martyrs. Li Henghuan was lying half-sideways, his chest tightly pressed against the firing hole on the fire point, his left hand still tightly grasping a piece of wood on the upper edge of the fire point. Jin Renhuan's upper body was completely inside the firing hole, completely blocking it, and the enemy's machine gun was pushed by him into the inside of the fire point.

With heavy hearts, their comrades wrapped the bodies of the two martyrs in military raincoats, placed them on stretchers, and prepared to carry them to the rear. Then, they planted a bright flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the newly occupied height.

    朝鲜人民军中的两位马特洛索夫式的英雄
    新华社记者  李犁
    朝鲜人民军某部，在去年十一月三日攻击文登里以东八五一高地上的敌人的战斗中，出现了两位马特洛索夫式的英雄，他们的名字是李亨焕和金仁焕。
    那天晚上九点钟，部队在强大的炮火掩护下向敌人据守着的八五一高地发起攻击。当先头的一小部分突击部队冲上主峰以后，敌人的少数未被炮火摧毁的火力点突然复活了，主峰的正面和左、右两侧共有三个火力点又射出猛烈的火力，后续部队完全被截住在主峰后面的一座山梁上。这时冲上主峰的少数突击部队已与敌人展开白刃战，情况是万分紧急的。但是因为敌人的火力强，特别是右侧的那个火力点里的一挺重机枪射击得最疯狂，对被压在山梁上的后续部队威胁也最大。后续部队发起了几次冲锋，都增援不上去。
    这时，十八岁的青年战士、民主青年同盟盟员李亨焕请得了去迅速消灭右侧那个火力点的任务。李亨焕冒着敌人火力的封锁绕过火力点的正面，从侧面接近了火力点。敌人的火力点修筑在一座一丈多高的陡壁上，李亨焕的战友们在照明弹光下看见李亨焕接近了火力点以后，就把冲锋枪挂在臂上，攀着陡壁上的岩石缝隙和荆棘爬上去。李亨焕爬上去后立刻敏捷地向火力点扔出一颗手雷，不料手雷撞在火力点外面的铁丝网上，把铁丝网炸了个粉碎。没有炸着火力点。后面的人们看见李亨焕又向前爬了爬扔出了第二颗手雷，正巧落在火力点上爆炸了，敌人的机枪立刻不响了。随着后续部队中爆发出一片“满塞（万岁）”的吼声，又发起了冲锋。可是刹那之间敌人的重机枪又叫了起来，敌人的火力点没有完全被炸坏，射口里重新又喷出火舌，正发起冲锋的部队又被压在山坡上。
    这正是战斗胜败的关键，这个火力点不立刻消灭，攻击就要受挫。也就在这一刹那间，借着敌人机枪吐出的闪闪的火光，李亨焕的战友们看见李亨焕从火力点侧面窜了出来，像闪电那样快地扑到射口上，敌人的机枪立刻就哑然无声了，部队猛冲上主峰。
    但是当人民军已经大部攻占了这座山头，接近到离主峰只有三四十公尺的地方，快要和已经冲上主峰的突击部队会合的时候，残存的敌人又凭借着主峰顶上的中心火力点，作疯狂的最后的挣扎。敌人的火力点里的一挺大口径机枪射出的弹雨，打得山坡上的石头火星飞迸。攻击又被阻住了。
    这时，从自己阵地上的扩音器里传来了宏亮的声音：“为了祖国，为了我们的父母亲人，向美帝国主义者复仇！……”这时伏在最前边的劳动党员金仁焕回过头来向他身后的战友们说：“同志们，你们掩护我，我去消灭这个火力点！”同志们用火力掩护着他，他左手握着冲锋枪，右手握着一颗手雷，用两肘支地向火力点爬去。山坡上高低不平，金仁焕尽量利用敌人不易看见的洼处向上爬，但当他不得不爬过一条较高的土坎时，敌人立刻向他打来一梭子机枪。在照明弹的光亮下，后面的同志们看着他突然垂下头来不动了。但是当敌人以为他已被打死而把火力略一转移的时候，只见他猛然一翻身滚过了那个土坎，继续向敌人的火力点艰难地爬去，这时，后面的同志们心里都非常明白了，这个身负重伤的亲爱的战友是要去做什么呢？同志们的眼睛都被泪水模糊了，很快金仁焕爬到了敌人火力点前，接着火力点上喷吐着红火的射口突然黑暗了。
    伏在后面的金仁焕的战友们，怀着无比的仇恨，勇猛地冲上主峰，和先打上去的突击部队会合起来，全部消灭了残余的敌人。这次战斗中一共消灭了六百多个美军。
    第二天清晨，李亨焕和金仁焕的战友们找到了二位烈士的遗体。李亨焕半侧着身子，胸膛紧贴着火力点上的射口，左手还紧紧地抓着火力点上边的一根木头。金仁焕的上半截身子完全钻进了射口，把射口完全塞住，敌人的机枪被他推进了火力点的里面。
    他们的战友们怀着沉痛的心情，把两位烈士的遗体用军用雨布包起来，放在担架上，准备抬到后方去。然后，他们把一面鲜艳的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗插在新占领的高地上。
