    Preventing Blind Expansion of Economic Crop Planting Area
    According to letters from readers in various places: After the announcement of the new cotton-grain price ratio, the situation of blindly expanding the planting area of economic crops and reducing the planting area of food crops is still quite common in various places. This is because: In the past few years, farmers have gained greater benefits from growing cotton, so they have a greater interest in planting economic crops; many places have not yet conducted universal, in-depth, and correct publicity and explanation to farmers regarding the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's instructions on the new cotton-grain price ratio; some local leading organs, when formulating production increase plans last winter and this spring, blindly focused on their own small scope and proposed plans to grow more economic crops; some cadres felt that they had mobilized farmers to grow more cotton in the past, and now it was "difficult to change their tune"; some cadres one-sidedly believed that growing more industrial raw materials was supporting industry, ignoring the great significance of increasing grain production for the overall national construction and people's livelihood. In addition, farmers in some rice-growing areas feel that there is a shortage of fertilizer and water sources, and there are also difficulties with seeds, farm tools, and labor (growing rice requires more male labor than growing cotton), so they want to use the method of growing more cotton to overcome these difficulties.
    To prevent the blind expansion of the planting area of cotton and other economic crops, rural work cadres must first truly recognize that increasing grain production is the primary task on the agricultural production front, earnestly study the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's instructions on this year's cotton-grain price ratio, and then use methods acceptable to the broad masses of farmers to conduct universal publicity to them; they must help farmers well to summarize and promote the experience of increasing grain crop production, so that farmers can obtain more income per mu of grain land; they must earnestly help farmers solve the various specific difficulties in planting grain crops. This is a very urgent task that must be seized upon and handled carefully. Otherwise, if various crops are sown, it will be impossible to change them. However, when carrying out this work, we must adopt meticulous and arduous economic work and political work methods, and must not use crude and coercive methods simply because time is tight.

    防止盲目扩大经济作物的种植面积
    据各地读者来信反映：在新的棉粮比价公布之后，各地盲目扩大经济作物播种面积、减少粮食作物播种面积的情形还是相当普遍的。这是因为：过去几年以来，农民由于多种棉花，获得了较大的利益，因此对于种植经济作物就有更大的兴趣；许多地方还没有把政务院财政经济委员会关于新的棉粮比价的指示向农民进行普遍、深入、正确的宣传解释；有些地方的领导机关在去冬今春制订增产计划时，盲目地从自己的小范围着眼，提出了多种经济作物的计划；有些干部觉得过去曾动员农民多种棉花，现在“不好改口”；有些干部片面地认为多种工业原料才算是支援工业，忽略了增产粮食对于整个国家建设和人民生活的重大意义。此外，部分种稻地区的农民感到肥料不足、水源不够，种籽、农具、劳力（种稻比种棉需要男劳动力多）也有困难，就想用多种棉花的办法来克服这些困难。
    要防止棉花和其他经济作物播种面积盲目扩大，农村工作干部首先要真正认识清楚增产粮食是农业生产战线上的首要任务，认真地学习政务院财政经济委员会关于今年棉粮比价的指示，然后用广大农民所能接受的方法，对他们进行普遍的宣传；要好好帮助农民总结和推广粮食作物的增产经验，使农民在每亩粮田上获得更多的收益；要切实帮助农民解决种植粮食作物的各种具体困难。这是一个十分紧急的任务，必须抓紧时间，谨慎处理。否则，各种作物如果播种完毕，再想改变就不可能了。但在进行这件工作的时候，必须采用细致的、艰苦的经济工作和政治工作的方法，切不可因为时间紧迫而使用粗暴的强迫命令的方法。
