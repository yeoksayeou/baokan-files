Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 6th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communiqué on April 6th: The liaison groups from both sides, formed to make preliminary arrangements for the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war and to agree on a date for the resumption of armistice negotiations, held their first meeting at Panmunjom at 10:00 a.m. on April 6th, in accordance with the suggestion made by our commander on April 1st.

The head of our liaison group attending the meeting was General Li Sang-cho of the Korean People's Army, and the head of the opposing liaison group was Rear Admiral Daniel of the United States Navy.

At the meeting, General Li Sang-cho stated: Now that the commanders of both sides have agreed to repatriate sick and wounded prisoners of war in accordance with Article 109 of the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, our side, in order to resolve this issue quickly and thoroughly, is prepared to repatriate all sick and wounded prisoners of war in our custody. This means that not only are we prepared to immediately repatriate all seriously ill and seriously wounded prisoners of war, that is, the prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated under Article 109 of the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, but we are also prepared to simultaneously repatriate all other sick and wounded prisoners of war, that is, the sick and wounded prisoners of war who may be accommodated in neutral countries during hostilities as stipulated in Article 109 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.

The other side suggested adjourning the meeting until April 7th in order to consider our opinion.

At the meeting, the other side raised some suggestions regarding detailed arrangements for the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, and our side stated that it would reply after studying them.

The second meeting of the liaison groups of both sides is scheduled to be held at 11:00 a.m. on April 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, April 6th: Baudic, a reporter for the Parisian humanitarian newspaper "Humanité," reported from Panmunjom on April 6th: At the first liaison group meeting held this morning, the Korean-Chinese side suggested that all sick and wounded prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated and those who should be accommodated in neutral countries be repatriated in accordance with Articles 109 and 110 of the Geneva Convention. The meeting began at 10 a.m., and the representatives immediately discussed the matter. The U.S. side put forward a draft agreement on arrangements for the exchange of sick and wounded personnel at Panmunjom and requested that an estimated number for the exchange be provided. General Li Sang-cho, head of the Korean-Chinese liaison group, agreed that an estimated number should be exchanged soon, but proposed that the categories of sick and wounded to be repatriated should be determined first. General Li then said that the Korean-Chinese side was prepared to repatriate all sick and wounded prisoners of war as stipulated in Articles 109 and 110 of the Geneva Convention.

This would include all the sick and wounded, not just the seriously ill and seriously wounded. Rear Admiral Daniel, head of the U.S. liaison group, said that the U.S. side had not yet considered the issue of categories. He immediately requested a recess to study the issue. After the meeting resumed, he requested another recess until tomorrow to consider the proposal carefully. Daniel said: "We are prepared to directly repatriate to Panmunjom the sick and wounded prisoners of war stipulated in Article 109 of the Geneva Convention."

The Korean-Chinese side suggested that all those who, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, could be directly repatriated during hostilities or could be accommodated in neutral countries during hostilities should be repatriated. According to Article 110 of the Geneva Convention, this includes the following categories: Those who can be directly repatriated are "the wounded and sick who, according to medical opinion, are not likely to recover within one year, whose condition requires treatment, and whose mental and physical strength appears to have been seriously impaired," the incurably wounded and sick, and those who have recovered but whose mental and physical strength has been seriously and permanently impaired. Those who may be accommodated in neutral countries include "the wounded and sick who may be expected to recover within one year from the date of their injury or illness, if treatment in a neutral country offers more certain or rapid prospects of recovery," and those whose mental and physical health may be threatened if they are not accommodated in a neutral country.

According to the Korean-Chinese proposal, all of these categories can be repatriated. The next meeting will be held at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

    朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团发表公报
    双方联络组开第一次会议
    我准备遣返收容的所有病伤战俘
    【新华社开城六日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月六日发表公报如下：为初步安排交换病伤战俘并商定恢复停战谈判的日期而组成的双方联络组，根据我方司令官四月一日的建议，于四月六日上午十时在板门店举行第一次会议。
    出席会议的我方联络组组长为朝鲜人民军李相朝将军，出席会议的对方联络组组长为美国丹尼尔海军少将。
    会上李相朝将军表示：现在双方司令官已同意按照一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约第一零九条遣返病伤战俘，我方为了迅速彻底解决这个问题，准备遣返我方收容下的所有病伤战俘。这就是说：我方不但准备立即遣返所有重病重伤战俘，也就是一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约第一零九条规定应予直接遣返的战俘，而且准备同时遣返所有其他患病和受伤的战俘，也就是日内瓦战俘公约第一零九条规定可在战事期间收容在中立国的病伤战俘。
    对方建议休会至四月七日，以便考虑我方这一意见。
    会上对方曾提出关于交换病伤战俘的若干细节安排的建议，我方表示将在研究后答复。
    双方联络组第二次会议定于四月七日上午十一时举行。
    【新华社六日讯】巴黎人道报记者贝却敌六日自板门店报道：在今天上午举行的第一次联络组会议上，朝中方面建议根据日内瓦公约第一百零九条和第一百一十条，将应予直接遣返和应收容于中立国的全部病伤战俘均予遣返。会议是在上午十时开始的，代表们马上就讨论事务。美方提出了关于安排在板门店交换病伤人员事宜的协议草案，并要求提出交换的概数。朝中联络组组长李相朝将军同意应很快交换概数，但提议首先应确定要遣返的病者和伤者的类别。李将军接着说，朝中方面准备照日内瓦公约的第一百零九条和第一百一十条所规定的那样遣返全部病伤战俘。
    这将包括全部病者和伤者，而不仅是重病和重伤者。美方联络组组长丹尼尔海军少将说，美方尚未考虑类别的问题。他马上要求休会以研究这个问题。会议复会后，他又要求休会到明天再开，以便仔细考虑这个建议。丹尼尔说：“我们准备把日内瓦公约第一百零九条所规定的病伤被俘人员直接遣返到板门店。”
    朝中方面建议把根据日内瓦公约可以在战事期间直接遣返，或可在战事期间收容于中立国的人全部遣返。根据日内瓦公约第一百一十条，这包括下列几类：可以直接遣返的是“根据医生意见不像能在一年内复原之伤者及病者，而其病况需要治疗，且其精神与体力似已严重减损者”，不能医治的伤者及病者，以及业已复原，但其精神与体力已严重地且永久地减损者。得收容于中立国的包括“伤者及病者之可希望于自其受伤之日或患病之日起，一年之内复原，如其在中立国治疗或可有更确定及迅速复原之希望者”，以及如收容于中立国可免除其身心健康所受的威胁者。
    根据朝中方面的建议，所有这几类全都可以遣返。下次会议将在明天上午十一点举行。
