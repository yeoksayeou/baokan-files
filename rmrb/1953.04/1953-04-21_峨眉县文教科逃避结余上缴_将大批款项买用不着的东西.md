    Emei County Culture and Education Section Evades Surrender of Surplus Funds, Purchases Large Quantities of Unnecessary Items
    Readers Ouyang Yuping, Tong Huaju, and Wan Caiyan write: At the end of last year, the Culture and Education Section of Emei County, Sichuan Province, spent over 250 million yuan of cultural and educational funds to buy many unnecessary items. This money could have been saved. However, the head of our county's Finance Section notified the head of the Culture and Education Section that unused funds at the end of the year would be frozen and handed over to the national treasury. Thereupon, the head of the Culture and Education Section bought large quantities of items; as a result, they bought chemical instruments, typewriters, radios, accordions, stage whips, jade belts, makeup, and so on for theatrical performances, totaling over one hundred and several tens of varieties, the vast majority of which are currently not needed. Because the time for purchasing goods was very urgent, the Culture and Education Section, fearing that the money would not be spent by the end of the year and would have to be turned over, signed "pre-purchase contracts" with the county department store, first issuing invoices for reimbursement and then taking the goods; some goods were even estimated at random prices before the price was known. Later, people were sent to Chengdu and Chongqing to buy things; as a result, the money was still not used up by the end of the year, and some more things were bought in January of this year.

    But on the other hand, some schoolhouses in our county are dilapidated, and the masses are paying for repairs themselves; some schools have no desks or benches, and students have to provide their own or borrow them from the farmers' associations; some schools even have broken or damaged blackboards. An elementary school in a village in the Fourth District has never had a toilet, and students defecate everywhere. The Culture and Education Section pays no attention to the above situation but spends large sums of money lavishly to purchase unnecessary items. The masses have a lot of opinions.

### 峨眉县文教科逃避结余上缴　将大批款项买用不着的东西

专栏：读者来信摘要

    峨眉县文教科逃避结余上缴　将大批款项买用不着的东西
    读者欧阳宇平、童华举、万才燕来信：四川峨眉县文教科在去年年底用二亿五千多万元文化教育事业费买了很多不需用的东西。这笔钱本来是可以结余下来的。但我县财政科长通知文教科长说：年底未用的资金要冻结上缴国库。于是文教科长就大买东西；结果买了化学仪器，打字机，收音机，手风琴，唱戏用的马鞭、玉带、化装品等共一百几十种，其中绝大部分目前都用不着。因为购货时间很急，文教科怕到年终钱用不完要上缴，就和县百货公司订“预购合同”，先开发票报销后再取货；甚至有些货还不晓得价就随便估计着开。到后来又派人到成都、重庆去买东西；结果到年底钱还未用完，今年一月份又买了一些东西。
    但另一方面，我县有些学校房子破烂不堪，群众自己在出钱修补；有些学校无桌凳，学生只得自备或由农会借出；有的学校连黑板也是破的、坏的。四区一个村的小学一直没有厕所，学生到处大小便。文教科对以上情况毫不关心，却随便用大量款子大肆购买用不着的东西。群众很有意见。
