Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: According to TASS, the term of the Hungarian National Assembly, elected every four years, will expire on May 15th this year. In accordance with Article 18 of the Constitution, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic has decided to hold elections for the National Assembly on May 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to TASS, Budapest: An upsurge of nominating candidates for members of the National Assembly is unfolding across Hungary. Enterprises, institutions, production cooperatives, and military units are holding conferences to nominate candidates for members of parliament. The working people are nominating outstanding political activists and advanced figures as candidates. At the voters' meeting of the Mátyás Rákosi Metallurgical Works, the voters participating in the meeting nominated Mátyás Rákosi, the leader of the Hungarian people, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, as a candidate with soaring enthusiasm.

The Hungarian National Assembly is the highest state power organ in Hungary. In the upcoming national elections on May 17th, two hundred and ninety-eight members and one hundred and fifty-four alternate members will be elected.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to TASS, Budapest, 13th: Hungarian newspapers published a letter to voters from the National Committee of the Hungarian People's Independent Front for the elections to the National Assembly of the Hungarian People's Republic, which will be held on May 17th.

The letter to voters first pointed out: It has been less than ten years since our motherland suffered the disasters of war, but today we are living and building in peace. Now, Hungary has become an advancing industrial country, and its masters are the working people who are building socialism. We have achieved these remarkable accomplishments primarily because the glorious Soviet army liberated us from foreign oppression and because of the selfless support and constant assistance of the great Soviet Union. At the same time, our achievements are due to the existence of the people's democratic system.

The letter to voters emphasized that the election promises made by the Hungarian People's Independent Front four years ago have been fulfilled and even overfulfilled. In the past three years, our national economy's investment has been 40 billion forints, while the original five-year plan (1950-1954) stipulated a five-year investment of only 35 billion forints. Steel production has increased from 800,000 tons in 1949 to 1.5 million tons in the third year of the five-year plan. The five-year plan stipulated that coal production would reach 18 million tons by the end of 1954, but in reality, coal production had already exceeded this number by the end of 1952.

The letter to voters described the great achievements Hungary has made in the past three or four years in improving the material and cultural living standards of the people, in the development of science and art, in organizing agricultural production cooperatives, and in other areas.

The letter to voters then said: One of the tasks of the new National Assembly is to pass the law on the second five-year plan for the national economy from 1955 to 1959. During the second five-year plan, we plan to build a socialist society in our country. During the second five-year plan, we must ensure that steel production reaches 3.5 million tons to 4 million tons, coal - 40 million tons to 50 million tons, electricity - 10 billion kWh to 12 billion kWh, and grain - 30 million quintals to 40 million quintals (each quintal equals 100 kilograms). The construction of the Budapest underground tramway and the Danube Grand Hydroelectric Power Station will continue, and the area of ​​irrigated land will increase to 650,000 to 700,000 holds (i.e., 370,500 hectares to 399,000 hectares). It is necessary to intensify the mechanization of arduous labor, especially the mechanization of arduous labor in the construction industry, coal mining industry, and agriculture. During the second five-year plan, 250,000 housing units will be built. Real wages will increase by 50 percent. The prices of food and manufactured goods will be reduced to increase the purchasing power of the working people. A large-scale cultural development plan has been drawn up. After the completion of the second five-year plan, we will surpass the developed capitalist countries not only in terms of development speed, but also in terms of per capita consumption. We must turn Hungary into a culturally developed and prosperous country.

The letter to voters said: The Hungarian People's Independent Front will, as in the past, follow a policy of peace, because peace is a necessary condition for continuing our great creative activities. The letter to voters called on voters to remain vigilant and step up the struggle for peace. The friendship and alliance between the Hungarian People's Republic and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are the guarantee of peace in our motherland. Moreover, we have a strong people's army, vigilantly defending our borders, making them inviolable. The Hungarian People's Republic sincerely hopes to participate in international cooperation, and therefore firmly advocates satisfying its legitimate demands that have already been recognized in the peace treaty: to enter the United Nations. The program of the Hungarian People's Independent Front is peace, work, prosperity, and progress.

The letter to voters also called on voters to vote in favor of the candidates of the Hungarian People's Independent Front.

    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十三日电：匈牙利报纸刊载匈牙利人民独立阵线全国委员会为即将在五月十七日举行的匈牙利人民共和国国民议会选举发表告选民书。
    告选民书首先指出：我们祖国遭受战争的灾祸到现在还不到十年，可是，今天我们已在和平中生活和从事建设了。现在，匈牙利已经成为一个前进中的工业国，它的主人是建设社会主义的劳动人民。我们能获得这些卓越的成就首先是由于光荣的苏军把我们从外国压迫下解放出来以及伟大苏联的无私支持和经常援助。同时，我们所获得的成就是由于人民民主制度的存在。
    告选民书强调说，匈牙利人民独立阵线四年前所作的选举诺言已经实现，而且超额实现了。在过去三年中，我们国民经济的投资是四百亿福林，而五年计划（一九五○—一九五四）原来规定的五年投资额只有三百五十亿福林。钢的产量已经从一九四九年的八十万吨增加到五年计划第三年的一百五十万吨。五年计划规定在一九五四年年底煤的开采量达到一千八百万吨，然而实际上，到一九五二年年底采煤量就已经超过这个数目了。
    告选民书叙述了过去三、四年中匈牙利在人民物质和文化生活水平的提高方面，在科学、艺术的发展方面，在组织农业生产合作社以及其他方面的巨大成就。
    告选民书随后说：新国民议会的任务之一是通过关于一九五五年到一九五九年第二个国民经济五年计划的法律。在第二个五年计划期间，我们预定在我们国家建设社会主义社会。在第二个五年计划期间，我们必须保证使钢的产量达到三百五十万吨到四百万吨，煤——四千万吨到五千万吨，电力——一百亿瓩时到一百二十亿瓩时，谷物——三千万公担到四千万公担（每公担合一百公斤）。布达佩斯地下电车道和多瑙河大水电站的建筑将继续进行，受灌溉地区的面积将增加到六十五万到七十万霍尔特（即三十七万零五百公顷到三十九万九千公顷）。必须加紧实行费力劳动的机械化，首先是建筑工业、采煤工业和农业费力劳动的机械化。在第二个五年计划时期将建筑二十五万组房屋。实际工资将增加百分之五十。食品和制成品的价格将予以减低，以提高劳动人民的购买力。大规模的文化发展计划已经拟好。第二个五年计划完成后，我们将不仅在发展速度方面，而且在每人的消费方面也要超过各发达的资本主义国家。我们必须把匈牙利变成一个文化发达的、繁荣的国家。
    告选民书说：匈牙利人民独立阵线将和过去一样遵循和平政策，因为和平是继续进行我们伟大的创造性活动的必要条件。告选民书号召选民们保持警惕，加紧进行争取和平的斗争。匈牙利人民共和国和苏联以及人民民主国家之间的友谊和同盟是我们祖国和平的保证。并且，我们有了一支强大的人民军队，警惕地保卫着我们的边疆，使它不受侵犯。匈牙利人民共和国衷心地希望参加国际合作，因此坚决主张满足和约中已经承认的它的合法要求：进入联合国。匈牙利人民独立阵线的纲领是和平、工作、繁荣和进步。
    告选民书中并号召选民投票拥护匈牙利人民独立阵线候选人。
