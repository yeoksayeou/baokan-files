Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: Li Xian, head of the Chinese delegation to the International Social Security Conference, issued a written report on the conference's situation and achievements after returning to Beijing.

The report began by stating: The International Social Security Conference was convened under the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions. After active preparations, the conference was held in Vienna from March 2nd to 6th. There were 266 delegates from 59 countries participating in the conference, including trade union workers, doctors, and social security experts.

The report continued: This conference was a democratic, united, and victorious event. It demonstrated that the world's working class has united under the goal of defending, improving, and expanding social security. Henri Raynaud, Vice-Chairman of the National Federation of Social Security Organizations of France, gave a general report to the conference on defending, improving, and expanding social security. A total of 55 delegates fully expressed their opinions at the meeting. Representatives from Africa, Asia, and Latin America all made important speeches. Based on this broad democratic discussion, the conference unanimously adopted three documents: the Social Security Plan, the Appeal to the Working People of the World, and the Memorandum to the United Nations. The conference also adopted two recommendations: organizing social security conferences in various continental regions and to the preparatory committee of the International Social Security Conference.

The report pointed out: The speeches of delegates from various countries, as well as the exhibitions held during the conference, clearly reflected two different situations resulting from two different social systems. The deplorable state of social security in capitalist countries is the result of the policy of war preparation. The United States' military expenditure accounts for 87 percent of its budget, while social programs account for 5 percent, and public health expenditure is less than 1 percent. The French government spends 600 billion francs annually on aggression against Vietnam, while only 57.5 billion francs are spent on national public health. The British government allocated only 26 percent of the required social security funds in the 1949-1950 fiscal year, and this will be reduced to 12 percent in the 1953-1954 fiscal year. There are already two million unemployed workers in Italy, and another two to three million are partially unemployed. The situation in colonial and semi-colonial countries is even worse.

The report further pointed out: The social security undertakings of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, are developing rapidly. The Soviet Union has a comprehensive social security system. In 1952, expenditures on healthcare and sports increased by 100 percent compared to 1946. In the post-war years, 16 million people received sanatorium and rest home treatment. In 1952 alone, 4.5 million people received sanatorium and rest home treatment.

The report emphasized: The rapid achievements made by New China in labor insurance over the past three years are a living example for the people of all colonial and semi-colonial countries, and also have ample educational significance for the people of capitalist countries.

The report concluded: The conference, starting from the concrete issue of social security related to the lives of workers and staff, educated and mobilized the broad masses of workers to fight for peace and democracy. The conference clearly pointed out that the war preparation policy of the capitalist countries, headed by U.S. imperialism, is the root cause of the deplorable living conditions and social security of the broad masses of working people, and exposed the miserable state of unemployment and famine under the rule of the international bourgeoisie, thereby also exposing the reformist and reactionary features of the bourgeoisie's tools—the International Labour Organization and the International Social Security Association—and their deception of the workers. On the other hand, the conference pointed out the achievements of social security, the rapid development of production, and the steadily improving living standards of workers in the socialist camp countries, headed by the Soviet Union, powerfully demonstrating the superiority of socialism and the people's democratic system, and demonstrating that this system truly represents the vital interests of the working class.

    国际社会保险会议上各国代表的发言
    再次表明社会主义、人民民主制度的优越性
    同时反映了资本主义国家社会保险的恶劣情况
    【新华社二日讯】出席国际社会保险会议的中国代表团团长李仙在回到北京后，就国际社会保险会议的情况及其成就发表书面报告。
    报告首先说：国际社会保险会议是在世界工会联合会号召下召开的。会议在经过积极的筹备后，于三月二日至六日在维也纳举行。参加这次会议的有五十九个国家的二百六十六个代表，各国代表中包括有工会工作者、医生、社会保险问题专家等人。
    报告接着说：这次会议是一个民主的、团结的、胜利的大会，它说明全世界的工人阶级已在保卫、改进与扩大社会保险的目标下团结起来。法国全国社会保险机关联合会副主席亨利·雷诺向会议作了关于保卫、改进与扩大社会保险的总报告，一共有五十五个代表在会上充分地发表了自己的意见，非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲三个地区的代表都作了重要发言。在这种广泛的民主讨论的基础上，会议一致通过了社会保险计划、告世界劳动人民书及致联合国备忘录三个文件。会议并通过了组织各大陆区域的社会保险会议与给国际社会保险会议筹备委员会的两项建议。
    报告指出：各国代表的发言，以及在大会期间举行的展览会，明显地反映了两种不同的社会制度所产生的两种情况。各资本主义国家社会保险的恶劣情况，是备战政策所造成的结果。美国的军费开支占预算的百分之八十七，社会事业的开支是百分之五，公共卫生事业的开支不及百分之一；法国政府一年内用于侵略越南的军费是六千亿法郎，用于全国公共卫生事业的仅五百七十五亿法郎；英国政府在一九四九—一九五○年度拨出的社会保险经费仅为应拨的百分之二十六，一九五三—一九五四年度还要减至百分之十二；意大利的失业工人已达二百万，半失业的已有二百万至三百万人。殖民地半殖民地国家的情况更加恶劣。
    报告接着指出：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的社会保险事业日益发展。苏联有全面的社会保险制度。一九五二年用于保健、体育的经费比一九四六年增加了百分之百。在战后几年中，一千六百万人得到了疗养和休养。在一九五二年一年中，就有四百五十万人得到疗养和休养。
    报告强调：新中国三年来在劳动保险上迅速取得的成就，对一切殖民地半殖民地国家人民是一个活的典范，对资本主义国家人民同样有着充分的教育意义。
    报告最后说：会议从社会保险这一与工人、职员生活有关的具体问题，教育并动员了广大工人群众为和平、民主而斗争。会议明确地指出了以美帝国主义为首的资本主义国家的备战政策，是促成广大劳动人民的生活和社会保险的恶劣情况的总根源，揭露了在国际资产阶级统治下的失业和饥荒的惨状，从而也就揭露了资产阶级的御用工具——国际劳工组织和国际社会保险协会的改良主义的反动面貌及其对工人的欺骗。在另一方面，会议指出了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的社会保险成就、生产的迅速发展和工人生活日益提高，有力地说明了社会主义和人民民主制度的优越性，说明这种制度是真正代表工人阶级的切身利益的。
