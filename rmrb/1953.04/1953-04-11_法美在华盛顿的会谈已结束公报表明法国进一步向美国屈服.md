Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The three-day meeting of the heads of government of the United States and France in Washington concluded on March 28th. In addition to US President Eisenhower and French Premier Mayer, the heads of diplomacy, defense, and finance of the two governments also participated in the meeting.

According to various sources, the meeting covered a wide range of issues, from policies towards the Soviet Union and China, the Korean and Vietnamese wars, war preparations in Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Balkans, to France's political, financial, and economic crises, and the issue of American encroachment on France in South America. However, the main issues discussed at the meeting were: US assistance to France in intensifying the colonial war in Vietnam; strengthening war preparations in Western Europe, mainly accelerating the rearmament of West Germany through the European Army; and France's own financial and political crisis related to these two matters.

During the talks, French Minister of Relations with the Member States of the Federation Letourneau and US Assistant Secretary of Defense Nash also held secret military meetings. It was revealed that they specifically studied the issue of accelerating the establishment of the Bao Dai puppet army to implement the US policy of using Asians to fight Asians in Vietnam. The communiqué issued after the three-day meeting emphasized the "interdependence" of the Vietnam War and the Korean War. This opened the door for the United States to fully interfere in the Vietnam issue.

The communiqué shows that the French government abjectly succumbed to the will of the United States. The communiqué announced that the French government was prepared to follow the British example and prohibit French ships from trading so-called "strategic materials" with China and would not provide coal in French territorial ports to similar ships from other countries. The French government also obediently expressed its recognition of the "continued urgent need to allow Germany to make a military contribution to European defense" and agreed to establish the so-called "European Defense Group" "as quickly as possible." The French government also expressed its intention to continue to follow the US Cold War policy.

Although the French side promised a large number of obligations to the United States, it only received some vague and slippery answers from the United States on some of the most pressing issues raised by France, such as financial assistance, trade, and the status of the Saar, such as: "consider further," "need for further study," "seek solutions at the first opportunity," and so on.

A section in the communiqué stated: "France's participation in the European Group does not in any way alter its interests and responsibilities outside of Europe." This is obviously a sop that the United States brought back to Mayer in France. Due to the widespread domestic opposition to the re-militarization of West Germany, even some of the French bourgeoisie insisted on maintaining France's independence in participating in the European Defense Group. The reason they put forward was that France bears federal obligations outside of Europe. The inclusion of this point in the communiqué is ostensibly a concession by the United States. However, it is worth noting an off-the-record message that Dulles reportedly told the French during the talks that after further US interference in the Vietnam War, France should guarantee "independence" to the Bao Dai puppet regime, which in effect meant France was to cede its rule over the Bao Dai puppet regime to the United States.

Regarding the Saar issue, it was revealed that the French had insisted that the United States recognize France's occupation of the Saar—a piece of fat snatched from Germany by French capitalists—as a condition for France's ratification of the European Army Treaty. However, no agreement was reached on this issue at the meeting.

### 法美在华盛顿的会谈已结束公报表明法国进一步向美国屈服

    法美在华盛顿的会谈已结束公报表明法国进一步向美国屈服
    据新华社讯：美、法两国政府首脑在华盛顿举行的三天会议已在三月二十八日结束。参加这次会议的除了美国总统艾森豪威尔和法国总理迈耶，还有两国政府的外交、国防和财政首脑。
    据各方面透露，会议所涉及的问题范围很广，从对苏联和中国的政策、朝鲜和越南战争、西欧中东和巴尔干方面的战争准备、法国的政治和财政经济危机到美法两国在北非的地位和美国在南美排挤法国的问题等。但会议所讨论的主要问题是：美国协助法国加紧进行越南殖民战争；加强西欧方面的战争准备、主要是加速通过欧洲军使西德重新武装起来；以及和这两件事有关的法国本身的财政和政治危机。
    在会谈期间，法国联邦成员国关系部部长勒杜尔诺和美国助理国防部长纳希还举行了秘密军事会议，据透露，曾特别研究加速建立保大傀儡军以在越南贯彻美国的以亚洲人打亚洲人的政策的问题。三天的会谈结束后发表的公报强调越南战争和朝鲜战争的“相互依存关系”。这替美国全面干涉越南问题的行动打开了大门。
    公报表明法国政府卑贱地顺从美国的意志。公报宣布法国政府准备仿照英国榜样，禁止法国船只对中国进行所谓“战略物资”的贸易，并不给其他国家的同类船只在法国领地港口添煤。法国政府还恭顺地表示承认“继续有急迫的必要容许德国对欧洲防务作出军事贡献”，同意要“尽速”使所谓“欧洲防务集团”建立起来。法国政府并表示要继续追随美国的冷战政策。
    法国方面虽然对美国承诺了一大堆义务，但在法国所提出的一些它最感迫切的问题如财政援助、贸易、萨尔地位等上面只得到美方的一些空泛和滑头的回答，诸如：“再考虑”，“要进一步研究”，“一有机会就谋求解决”等等。
    公报中的一段提出：“法国参加欧洲集团丝毫不改变它的在欧洲以外的利益和责任。”这显然是美国给迈耶带回法国去的一块塞嘴的糖。由于国内对西德重新军国主义化的普遍反对，甚至法国一部分资产阶级也坚持在参加欧洲防务集团中要保持法国的独立性，他们提出来的理由就是法国承担着欧洲以外的联邦义务。公报里提出这一点表面上是美国的一个让步。但值得注意的一个会外的消息说，杜勒斯在会谈中曾经向法国人表示，在美国进一步干涉越南战争之后，法国应保证给保大傀儡以“独立”，这实际上就是要法国把对保大傀儡的统治权让给美国。
    关于萨尔问题，据透露，法国人曾坚持要美国承认法国对萨尔——法国资本家抢自德国的一块肥肉——的占有，作为法国批准欧洲军条约的条件。但会谈并未就这个问题取得协议。
