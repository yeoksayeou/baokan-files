Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS Moscow reports: Moscow newspapers on the 2nd published many news items and letters showing that the Soviet people warmly welcomed the sixth price reduction in the Soviet Union since the war. The Soviet people are very satisfied that this price reduction once again eloquently proves the Communist Party and the Soviet government's tireless efforts to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

At the Baku oil workers' conference, foreman Ajumanov said: This price reduction once again proves the strength of the Soviet motherland. In capitalist countries, economic militarization makes working people poor and suffer. However, in our country engaged in peaceful construction, life is getting better and better.

Matschurov, a well-known Stakhanovite worker at the Minsk Tractor Factory, said at the factory's workers' conference: The principle of the Soviet state is to maximize the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the people. The government's sixth reduction in the price of food and manufactured goods clearly proves this.

Many people told the Pravda reporter about the benefits of this price reduction. A. Ovchinnikov, a steelworker who has worked at the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle Factory" for 23 years, said: My situation is the same as that of many workers working with me. Because of this price reduction, my family can save at least 3,500 rubles a year. Engineer V. Chavrazhenov, a family of four, said: My family can save more than 500 rubles a month because of this. Young worker S. Antipov, who graduated from vocational school and started working six months ago, said: I now receive a monthly salary of more than 1,500 rubles. According to the new prices, a rich meal with three dishes now saves 33% compared to before. I will use the money I save to buy books and other things.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS Moscow reports: April 1st was the first day that the Soviet Union implemented its sixth price reduction since the war, and business was particularly booming in Moscow stores.

Fruits and vegetables were particularly popular. Compared with before the price reduction, the number of lemons sold yesterday increased nearly sixfold, and the number of apples and oranges increased two and a half times. Sales of high-quality white bread, meat products and sausages, cheese, and butter also increased significantly.

The business of stores selling manufactured goods was also very good. Particularly popular goods were coats, overcoats, uniforms, casual wear, scarves, hats, and shoes. The stores also sold many refrigerators, motorcycles, and bicycles. Sales of silk and woolen fabrics increased by 50%.

The Central Department Store had 140,000 customers on April 1st and made approximately 130,000 transactions, exceeding any day's record in March. With the reduction of prices in state-owned stores and cooperative stores, prices in collective farm markets have also fallen.

    苏联人民享受和平建设成果生活越过越好
    第六次减低物价的第一天莫斯科各商店生意特别兴隆
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报二日刊载许多消息和函电，显示苏联人民热烈欢迎苏联战后第六次减低物价。苏联人民非常满意地指出：这次减低物价再一次雄辩地证明了共产党和苏维埃政府不倦地为提高人民的物质文化水平而努力。
    在巴库石油工人大会上，领班工人阿朱马诺夫说：这次减低物价再一次证明了苏维埃祖国的力量。在资本主义国家中，经济军事化使得劳动人民受穷受苦。但是，在我们从事和平建设的国家里，生活越过越好。
    明斯克拖拉机工厂著名斯塔哈诺夫式工作者马楚罗夫在该厂工人大会上说：苏维埃国家的准则就是最大限度地满足人民的物质和文化需要。政府第六次减低食品和制成品的价格又清楚地证明了这一点。
    许多人对真理报记者叙述了这次减低物价给他们的好处。在莫斯科“锤子与镰刀工厂”工作了二十三年的炼钢工人阿·奥夫钦尼科夫说：我的情况就是和我一同工作的许多工人的情况。因为这次减价，我家一年至少能够节省三千五百卢布。一家四口的工程师维·查夫拉热诺夫说：我一家每月可以因此节省五百多卢布。六个月前才从职业学校毕业后就业的青年工人斯·安蒂波夫说：我现在已经拿到每月一千五百多卢布的工资。按新物价计算，现在吃一顿三个菜的丰富的饭食，要比以前节省百分之三十三，我要用节省下来的钱买书和其他东西。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：四月一日是苏联实行战后第六次减低物价的第一天，莫斯科各商店生意特别兴隆。
    特别畅销的是水果和蔬菜。和减价前相比，昨天出售的柠檬差不多增加到六倍、苹果和橘子增加到两倍半。上等白面包、肉制品和香肠、干酪和牛油的销售量也大大增加。
    出售制成品的商店的生意也非常好，特别畅销的货物是外衣、大衣、制服、便服、头巾、帽类和鞋类。各商店也售出了许多冰箱、机器脚踏车和自行车。丝织品和毛织品的销售量增加了百分之五十。
    中央百货公司在四月一日有十四万顾客，约做了十三万笔生意，超过了三月份任何一天的纪录。随着国营商店和合作社商店货价的减低，集体农庄市场的物价也下降了。
