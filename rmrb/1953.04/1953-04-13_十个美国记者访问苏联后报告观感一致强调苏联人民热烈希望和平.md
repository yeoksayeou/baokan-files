Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: According to a report by the German News Agency: Ten American journalists arrived in West Berlin after spending a week in Moscow. They held a press conference on the 9th to report their observations of their visit to Moscow and answered many questions. James Wick, the head of the American journalist group, and other journalists unanimously emphasized that all Soviet citizens they came into contact with were filled with a deep love for peace. James Wick said that the Soviet people, like the people of other countries in the world, fervently desire peace. He emphasized that the Soviet government's support for the proposals by Zhou Enlai and Kim Il-sung to end the Korean War proves that the Soviet Union hopes to reach peaceful agreements and peaceful resolutions on all issues of conflict. Another American journalist, Eugene Simon, admitted that during his stay in Moscow, he never encountered any Soviet citizen who did not firmly believe that peaceful coexistence between socialist and capitalist countries was possible. The American journalists also spoke about how their visit to Moscow had dispelled the prejudices and misconceptions they had developed under the influence of the strong anti-Soviet slander campaign in capitalist countries. Eugene Simon said that one should go to the Soviet Union to see the true situation there and how greatly it differs from the reports of the US State Department, the US Embassy in Moscow, and even foreign journalists stationed in Moscow. The ten journalists saw clear evidence that the living standards in Moscow are constantly improving, and that huge construction projects are being built and extensive cultural activities are being carried out throughout the country.

    十个美国记者访问苏联后报告观感一致强调苏联人民热烈希望和平
    【新华社十二日讯】据德意志通讯社报道：有十个美国记者在莫斯科逗留一星期后，抵达西柏林，他们在九日举行了一次记者招待会，报告他们访问莫斯科的观感，并回答了许多问题。美国记者团团长詹姆斯·威克和其他记者们一致强调说：他们接触到的一切苏联公民都满怀着对和平的深切热爱。詹姆斯·威克说：苏联人民正如世界上其他国家人民一样热烈地希望和平。他强调说：苏联政府对周恩来和金日成提出的结束朝鲜战争的建议的支持，证明了苏联希望在一切冲突的问题上达成和平协议并获致和平解决。另外一位美国记者尤金·西蒙承认：在他逗留莫斯科的期间，他从没有遇到过任何一个苏联公民不深信社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间的和平共存是可能的。美国记者们并且谈到他们此次访问莫斯科如何使他们消除了在资本主义国家内的强烈反苏诽谤运动影响下所产生的偏见和错误看法。尤金·西蒙说：一个人应该到苏联去看一看那里的真情实况与美国国务院、美国驻莫斯科大使馆、甚至驻莫斯科的外国记者们的报告中所说的有着多么大的不同。这十位记者看到了明显的证据，说明莫斯科的生活水平不断提高、各地正兴建巨大的建设工程并展开广泛的文化活动。
