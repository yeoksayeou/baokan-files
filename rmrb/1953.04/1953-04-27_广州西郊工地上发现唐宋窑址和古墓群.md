    Tang and Song Dynasty Kiln Sites and Ancient Tomb Complex Discovered on a Construction Site in the Western Suburbs of Guangzhou

    Workers constructing dormitories at Huangdigang and Shitougang in the western suburbs of Guangzhou have recently discovered Tang and Song dynasty kiln sites and an ancient tomb complex on the construction site. The porcelain unearthed from the three Tang and Song dynasty kiln sites discovered at Huangdigang belongs to the celadon system. Some are from the same period as the Yue kilns, and some may even predate the Yue kilns. Twenty-four ancient tombs from the Western Han, Jin, and Tang dynasties, discovered at Shitougang, have been cleared, and more than 400 artifacts have been unearthed. Some of the pottery forms have local characteristics. The most valuable finding is that exquisite porcelain glaze was already being fired on pottery from the early Western Han Dynasty, providing valuable information for the historical study of porcelain. Several tombs from the late Western Han Dynasty contained two glazed walls and two strings of beads made of glass, agate, and crystal. The unearthed objects also include gold ornaments, jade articles, and bronze swords, which provide valuable materials for the study of the lives and history of the ancient people of southern China.

    广州西郊工地上发现唐宋窑址和古墓群
    广州市西郊皇帝岗及石头岗正建筑工人宿舍，在工地上最近接连发现唐宋窑址和古墓群。在皇帝岗发现的三处唐宋窑址出土瓷器是属于青瓷系统的，有的和越窑时代相同，有的还可能早于越窑。在石头岗发现的西汉、晋、唐的古墓群，已有二十四座清理完毕，出土的器物有四百多件。其中有些陶器的形式具有地方的特色，最有价值的是在西汉初年的陶器上已烧有了精美的瓷釉，对瓷器的历史研究提供了宝贵的资料。西汉末年的几个古墓里，有两个琉璃壁和两串串珠，串珠是用琉璃、玛瑙、水晶等做成的。出土物中还有金饰、玉器和铜剑等，这些对研究我国南方古代人民生活及历史提供了很多宝贵的材料。
