    Seriously Improve Agricultural Production Propaganda Work

    Our agricultural production is constantly developing. This year, national agricultural production has a new and significant task of increasing production. To accomplish this new and significant task of increasing production, we must lead all farmers in making tremendous efforts. The Party's mass propaganda work in rural areas bears an important responsibility in this regard, and it must become an active force in promoting the advancement of the production increase movement.

    The main way to increase agricultural production in the future is to further improve farming techniques, fully exploit the potential of agricultural production, and increase yield per unit area. Therefore, the main task of rural propaganda work in the future is to conduct propaganda on agricultural production technology and the promotion of advanced production increase experiences. Only through such propaganda can farmers fully recognize the enormous possibilities of agricultural production increase and truly enhance the enthusiasm and confidence of the vast majority of farmers in agricultural production increase.

    How to make agricultural production propaganda better, so that it plays a greater role in promoting the agricultural production increase movement, is a question that we should pay attention to and study. In the past, various localities have had many good experiences in carrying out agricultural production propaganda. The experience of Zhaoyuan County in promoting the propaganda work of new farming methods, published in this newspaper today, is a typical example.

    Zhaoyuan County, by creating and promoting the new farming method of "equal-distance wide sowing, thinning and seedling protection, and phased topdressing," achieved a huge achievement in agricultural production in 1952, with an increase of 92.9 percent compared to 1951. The Party's propaganda work played an active role in this production increase movement. It was precisely because the Party's organizational leadership of propagandists and mass activists carried out extensive and in-depth propaganda, enabling the broad masses to understand the benefits of the new farming method, and thus consciously and actively adopt the new farming method, that the movement to promote the new farming method could become a truly mass movement.

    The characteristics of Zhaoyuan County's propaganda work lie in: first, it is good at combining the local farmers' existing production experience to carry out propaganda on new farming methods. When promoting the new farming method, the propagandists in Zhaoyuan County paid attention to using the facts of high production in local history and some scientific agricultural proverbs that are consistent with the new farming method to carry out propaganda, and let some old farmers who support the new farming method use their own experience to explain the new farming method to the masses. These methods have all achieved good results. The new farming method of "equal distance, wide sowing, thinning and seedling protection, and phased topdressing" was originally created by Comrade Ren Guodong, secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others by summarizing and improving the local agricultural production experience. Therefore, it is relatively easy to use the farmers' own experience to explain its correctness, and it is also relatively easy for the farmers to accept it. Second, it is good at enabling farmers to recognize the advantages of the new farming method and the possibility of increasing production based on their own personal experience. The purpose of the many propaganda methods they used, such as measuring the bottom of the ridge, counting the number of seedlings, weighing the ears of grain, calculating the yield, organizing field visits and crop competitions, mobilizing the masses to visit threshing grounds, and holding small agricultural crop exhibitions, was to repeatedly educate the farmers with facts, so that they could see the superiority of the new farming method with their own eyes, thereby breaking their own conservative ideas. These propaganda methods are lively and persuasive. After such propaganda and education, those who originally thought that "production has reached its peak" and did not believe in the possibility of further production increase came to believe that there was still a great possibility of production increase; those who originally held skeptical and resistant attitudes toward the new farming method actively supported and adopted the new farming method. In this way, the movement to promote the new farming method naturally became a conscious action of the masses.

    To carry out patient and meticulous persuasion and education work among the masses, to enlighten the masses' consciousness, to enable them to recognize the correctness of the Party's calls and policies based on their own personal experience, and thus to act actively in accordance with these calls and policies, has always been the basic principle of our Party's mass propaganda work. Rural propaganda work must especially adhere to this principle. Due to the characteristics of small-scale production, farmers today still have more conservatism in production. To enable them to improve or change their farming methods cannot be achieved all at once, but must go through a tortuous and complex process. Therefore, propaganda and education work for farmers must be particularly meticulous and patient. The success of Zhaoyuan County's propaganda work in promoting the new farming method is because they adhered to and applied this principle. But unfortunately, this principle has not been truly understood by all propaganda workers of our Party. Many Party propaganda workers often forget and violate this principle, and ignore the characteristics of farmers. When conducting propaganda to farmers, they do not patiently and repeatedly educate and persuade the masses with facts and the masses' own experience, but only carry out empty preaching to the masses, and even treat the masses with an attitude of sarcasm and attack, thus completely violating the principle of persuasion of the Party's propaganda work and turning propaganda work into a tool of coercion and command. This erroneous practice is quite common in rural propaganda work in various places. For example, when publicizing mutual aid and cooperation, instead of concretely publicizing the superiority of the mutual aid and cooperation system in production, thereby attracting farmers to voluntarily participate in mutual aid groups and cooperatives, they erroneously publicize that "working alone is unpatriotic," that is, "taking the capitalist road," and that is, "taking the road of Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism"; when promoting advanced experiences in increasing agricultural production, instead of concretely publicizing the superiority of these advanced experiences, they erroneously publicize that not adopting advanced farming methods is "unpatriotic," that is, "not responding to the Party's call," and even punish those farmers who do not yet understand the advantages of advanced farming methods and are therefore temporarily unwilling to adopt new farming methods. In addition, there are similar erroneous practices in carrying out propaganda on agricultural loans, public grain, cotton purchase, patriotic health, and so on. These erroneous propaganda have seriously hindered the correct implementation of the Party and government's various policies and have caused extremely bad effects among the masses. Some places have now begun to pay attention to correcting these phenomena, but in many other places, these phenomena have not yet attracted the attention of the Party's leading organs. Facts have proved that the occurrence of these serious phenomena and the failure to correct them for a long time are mainly due to the Party's organizations lacking serious leadership in rural mass propaganda work and insufficient education and assistance to propagandists. Therefore, in the future, Party organizations in various places must earnestly strengthen the education and assistance to propagandists, so that they can learn to carry out propaganda work like the propagandists in Zhaoyuan County.

    In order to strengthen the propaganda of agricultural production, especially agricultural production technology, and improve the level of agricultural production propaganda work, the most important thing is that Party propaganda cadres and rural propagandists at the county, district, and township levels must truly understand and be familiar with agricultural production technology, so that they can become experts in agricultural production. Only when Party propagandists understand advanced production technology can they talk about propaganda of advanced production technology; only when Party propaganda cadres at the county, district, and township levels understand advanced production technology can they talk about serious leadership of agricultural production propaganda. In order to help improve the study of agricultural production knowledge by reporters, propagandists, cadres, and activists, the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee adopted many methods such as running technical training classes, inviting agricultural technicians to give reports to propagandists, letting propagandists participate in village technical research associations, and organizing propagandists to regularly discuss and study agricultural technology issues. In addition, in order to facilitate the propaganda of agricultural technology, they also paid attention to absorbing agricultural technicians who meet the conditions of propagandists to serve as Party propagandists, and let experienced old farmers assist in doing propaganda work. These methods are all correct and should be done in various places.

    All Party rural propaganda workers must clearly recognize that since agricultural production is the constant and overriding central task in rural areas, the propaganda of agricultural production should naturally be the constant central content of the Party's rural propaganda work, and all other propaganda must be carried out around this central content. However, in some places, there are often phenomena of neglecting and relaxing agricultural production propaganda due to other propaganda work, or carrying out political propaganda in isolation without completely combining it with production propaganda, which is obviously wrong. Only by closely integrating political propaganda with production propaganda can political propaganda become an active factor in promoting rural work. Of course, while emphasizing the strengthening of production propaganda, we must oppose the erroneous tendency to neglect and relax political propaganda, or to only know how to carry out propaganda of production technology and not to contact political tasks at all, and not to point out the political significance of production work. Only by carrying out production propaganda on the basis of political propaganda, so that production propaganda contains rich political content, can production propaganda be highly ideological, can it truly raise the consciousness of farmers, and can it correctly guide farmers forward. Zhaoyuan's experience also proves this point.

### 认真改善农业生产宣传工作

    认真改善农业生产宣传工作
    我国的农业生产正在不断地发展。今年全国农业生产又有新的重大的增产任务。为了完成这一新的重大的增产任务，就必须领导全体农民进行极大的努力。党在农村中的群众宣传工作在这方面担负着重要的任务，它必须成为推动增产运动前进的积极的力量。
    今后农业增产的主要途径就是进一步改进耕作技术，充分发挥农业生产的潜力，提高单位面积的产量。因此，今后农村宣传工作的主要任务也就是进行关于农业生产技术和推广先进增产经验的宣传。只有通过这样的宣传，才能使农民充分认识农业增产的巨大可能性，真正提高广大农民对农业增产的积极性和信心。
    怎样使农业生产的宣传做得更好，使它对农业增产运动起更大的推动作用，这是我们应该注意研究的问题。过去各地在进行农业生产宣传方面已有不少好的经验，今天本报发表的肇源县推广新耕作法的宣传工作经验就是一个典型。
    肇源县由于创造和推广了“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”的新耕作法，使一九五二年的农业生产获得了比一九五一年增产百分之九十二点九的巨大成绩。党的宣传工作在这一增产运动中起了积极的作用。正是由于党的组织领导宣传员和群众积极分子进行了广泛深入的宣传，使广大群众懂得了新耕作法的好处，从而自觉地积极地采用新耕作法，所以才能使推广新耕作法的运动成为真正群众性的运动。
    肇源县宣传工作的特点就在于：第一，善于结合当地农民已有的生产经验去进行新耕作法的宣传。肇源县的宣传员们在推广新耕作法时，注意利用了当地历史上曾有过的高额生产的事实和一些科学的、与新耕作法相符合的农谚进行宣传，并让一些拥护新耕作法的老农用自己的经验去向群众解释新耕作法，这些办法都收到很好的效果。“等距、宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”这一新耕作法本来就是中共肇源县委书记任国栋等同志总结和提高了当地农业生产的经验而创造出来的，因此也就比较容易用农民自己的经验去说明它的正确性，也比较容易使农民接受它。第二，善于使农民根据自己的亲身体验去认识新耕作法的优点，认识增产的可能性。他们所用的许多宣传方法，如量垄底、数楂口、秤穗头、算产量，组织田间参观和庄稼评比，发动群众参观打场、举办小型的农作物展览等，其目的都是为着反复地用事实去教育农民，使他们亲眼看到新耕作法的优越性，从而打破自己的保守思想。这些宣传方法是生动活泼的，是最具有说服力的。在进行了这样的宣传教育后，原来认为“生产到顶”、不相信再有增产可能的人，就相信还有增产的极大可能了；原来对新耕作法抱怀疑和抗拒态度的，就积极拥护和采用新耕作法了。这样，推广新耕作法的运动就很自然地成为群众的自觉性的行动。
    对群众进行耐心的细致的说服教育工作，启发群众的自觉，使他们根据自己的亲身体验去认识党的号召和政策的正确性，从而按照这些号召和政策积极行动起来，这从来是我们党的群众宣传工作的基本原则。农村宣传工作尤其要坚决遵守这一原则。由于小生产的特点，农民今天在生产上还带有较多的保守性，要使他们改进或改变他们的耕作方法，不是一下子可以做到的，而必须经过一个曲折复杂的过程，因此向农民进行宣传教育工作就要特别细致和耐心。肇源县推广新耕作法的宣传工作的成功，就是因为他们遵守和运用了这一原则。 但可惜的是这一原则并不是我们党的所有的宣传工作者都已经真正懂得了的。有很多党的宣传工作人员常常忘记了和违背了这一原则，忽视了农民的特点，他们在向农民进行宣传时，不是用事实，用群众亲身的经验去耐心地反复地教育群众，说服群众，而只是向群众进行空洞的说教，甚至用讽刺打击的态度去对待群众，因而完全违背了党的宣传工作的说服原则，把宣传工作变成了强迫命令的工具。这种错误作法在各地农村宣传工作中是相当普遍地存在着的，例如在宣传互助合作时，不是具体地宣传互助合作制度在生产上的优越性，从而吸引农民自愿地参加互助组和合作社，而是错误地宣传“单干就是不爱国”，就是“走资本主义的道路”，就是“走蒋介石、美帝国主义的道路”；在推广农业增产的先进经验时，不是具体地宣传这些先进经验的优越性，而是错误地宣传不采用先进耕作法就是“不爱国”，就是“不响应党的号召”，甚至对那些还不懂得先进耕作法的优点、因而暂时还不愿意采行新耕作法的农民，施行惩罚手段。此外，在进行关于农贷、公粮、收购棉花、爱国卫生等等宣传工作上，都有类似的错误作法。这些错误的宣传已严重地妨碍了党和政府的各项政策的正确贯彻，并已在群众中造成了极坏的影响。有的地方现在已开始注意纠正这些现象，但在另外的许多地方，这些现象仍未引起党的领导机关的注意。事实证明这些严重现象的发生和长期得不到纠正，主要就是由于党的组织对农村群众宣传工作缺乏认真的领导和对宣传员教育帮助不够的缘故。因此，今后各地党的组织必须认真加强对宣传员的教育和帮助，要使他们学会像肇源县的宣传员那样地进行宣传工作。
    为了加强农业生产特别是农业生产技术的宣传，提高农业生产宣传工作的水平，最重要的一件事情就是县、区、乡党的宣传干部和农村宣传员必须真正懂得和熟悉农业生产技术，使自己成为农业生产的内行。党的宣传员只有懂得了先进的生产技术，才能谈得上先进生产技术的宣传；县、区、乡党的宣传干部也只有懂得了先进的生产技术，才能谈得上对农业生产宣传的认真领导。肇源县委为了帮助提高报告员、宣传员、干部和积极分子学习农业生产知识，采用了开办技术训练班，邀请农业技术员给宣传员作报告，让宣传员参加村技术研究会，组织宣传员经常讨论研究农业技术问题等许多办法。此外，为了便于进行农业技术的宣传，他们还注意吸收够宣传员条件的农业技术员充任党的宣传员，并让有生产经验的老农协助做宣传工作。这些办法都是正确的，各地都应这样做。
    一切党的农村宣传工作人员必须明确认识，由于农业生产是农村中的经常的压倒一切的中心任务，因此农业生产的宣传自然也应该是党的农村宣传工作的经常的中心内容，其他一切宣传都必须围绕着这一中心内容去进行。但是现在有些地方常有因其他宣传工作而忽视和放松农业生产宣传，或完全不结合生产宣传而孤立地进行政治宣传的现象，这显然是不对的。只有使政治宣传与生产宣传密切结合起来，才会使政治宣传成为推动农村工作的积极因素。当然，在强调加强生产宣传的同时，必须反对那种忽视和放松政治宣传，或只知进行生产技术的宣传而完全不联系政治任务、不会指明生产工作的政治意义的错误倾向。只有在政治宣传的基础上去进行生产宣传，使生产宣传包含有丰富的政治内容，生产宣传才是有高度思想性的，才能真正提高农民的觉悟，正确地引导农民前进。肇源的经验也证明了这个道理。
