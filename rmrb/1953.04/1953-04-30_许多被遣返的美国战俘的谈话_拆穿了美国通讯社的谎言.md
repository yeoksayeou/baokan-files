Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 28th: Our special correspondent reports that since the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war began at Panmunjom, American news agencies have continuously spread sensational lies about the so-called "mistreatment" of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side. American reporters insist that the Korean and Chinese side did not provide prisoners of war with good food and medical care. American reporters have especially written many articles under the terrifying topic of "death march," insisting that a large number of prisoners of war died on the way to the prisoner of war camp.

The lies reported by American news agencies are said to be based on so-called "reports" from American prisoners of war, but the conversations of many repatriated American sick and wounded prisoners of war have exposed these lies. American POW Sergeant Contreras said that the food he received in the hospital and later in the prisoner of war camp after being captured was good, and he also had books to read. He said that they had rice, beans, and a small amount of meat every night, and did not do any work except for some routine minor tasks. American POW Mandina said that whether during the long march to northwest Korea or in the prisoner of war camp, he never saw a single instance of mistreatment of prisoners of war. American POW Howard reported that four hours after he was captured, an officer of the Chinese People's Volunteers donated his own blood to him. American POW Navy Lieutenant Bloomhead said that the food and medical care in the prisoner of war camp were "adequate." Puerto Rican POW Costas-Chever said that he was not mistreated during his captivity, and "I did not see anyone else being mistreated." British prisoners of war also said that they had never seen any "death march" and admitted that they had received humanitarian treatment in the Korean and Chinese prisoner of war camps. British POW Bolt said, "Life in the prisoner of war camp was organized according to the military way of life. In terms of food, we had rice and soybeans. We were able to play a variety of sports such as football, volleyball, and basketball. The translators also told us world news." Twenty-two repatriated British prisoners of war said when they passed through Singapore on their way home that they had nothing to complain about regarding life in the Korean and Chinese prisoner of war camps. They had also never seen any mistreatment of prisoners of war. Even the Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Forces in Korea and Japan, Henry Wells, said: "From our conversations with the repatriated prisoners of war, we are not aware of any death march or any similar mistreatment."

American reporters interviewing in Panmunjom revealed the secret of American news agencies spreading such sensational news. According to them, the American Columbia Broadcasting Corporation was condemned by the U.S. State Department for not reporting news about the so-called "atrocities." Columbia Broadcasting Corporation sent a telegram asking its reporter in Panmunjom why he did not report these so-called "atrocities," and the reporter replied that he was reporting the facts.

American reporters in Panmunjom admitted that their superiors wanted them to fabricate news about the so-called "atrocities." They said that the United Press Tokyo branch received a telegram from New York saying, "Only limited interviews should be conducted with the repatriated prisoners of war, except for stories about atrocities and sensational stories." Under such instructions, American reporters fabricated a large number of lies about the so-called "atrocities." An Agence France-Presse reporter reported that these reporters asked prisoners of war questions, "more or less skillfully trying to get some sensational news from them." As a result, stories about the so-called "atrocities" were fabricated, but these stories were almost all inconsistent and full of contradictions. The Agence France-Presse reporter said, "In the absence of the flash of photographers, the conversations made by the repatriated prisoners of war seemed much more truthful. Several repatriated prisoners of war made statements in a quieter environment after arriving in Japan that contradicted what they had said in Korea." Even United Press itself admitted that these lies about the mass deaths of prisoners of war were not adding up. For example, regarding the lies about the deaths of prisoners of war in the so-called Pukchong prisoner of war camp, there were four very different versions from four prisoners of war.

This unfounded propaganda by the U.S. side has obviously aroused dissatisfaction in world public opinion. The British "Daily Mirror" published an editorial on April 24 entitled "Atrocities? Lies?" reminding its readers to be wary of lies about the so-called "atrocities" by the Korean and Chinese side coming from Korea. It said that the "angry politicians" in the United States are using this deliberately fabricated "hate propaganda" to "engage in incitement." The "Daily Mirror" warned: "American politicians should know that they cannot propose the terms of the victor. There is no victory at present, and there is no unconditional surrender. The current goal is to seek peace through agreement. Hate propaganda will not have any effect and may only prolong the war."

### 许多被遣返的美国战俘的谈话  拆穿了美国通讯社的谎言

    许多被遣返的美国战俘的谈话
    拆穿了美国通讯社的谎言
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者报道，在板门店双方交换病伤战俘开始以后，美国的通讯社就连续不断地散播所谓朝中方面“虐待”战俘的耸人听闻的谎言。美国记者们硬说朝中方面没有给战俘良好的饮食和医疗。美国记者们特别在“死亡行军”这样一个恐怖的题目下做了许多文章，硬说有大批战俘在前往战俘营的途中死亡。
    美国通讯社所报道的这些谎话，据说都是根据美国战俘的所谓“报告”，但是许多被遣返的美国病伤战俘的谈话却揭穿了美国通讯社的谎言。美国战俘康特拉拉斯中士说，他被俘以后在医院里以及后来在战俘营里所得到的饮食都不错，并且还有书籍阅读。他说，他们每天晚上都有米饭、豆子和少量的肉吃，并且除了一些例行的小事以外，没有做什么工作。美国战俘曼迪纳说，不论是在向朝鲜西北的长程行军中，或在战俘营中，他从未看到有一次虐待战俘的事件。美国战俘霍华德报告说，在他被俘以后四小时，有一位中国人民志愿军的军官曾经把自己的血输给他。美国战俘海军少尉布鲁姆海德说，战俘营里的食物和医疗都是“充足的”。波多黎各战俘考斯特—切弗尔说，他在被俘期间没有受到虐待，而且“我也没有看到别人受虐待”。英国的战俘也说他们从来没有看见过什么“死亡行军”，并承认他们在朝中战俘营中受到了人道主义待遇。英国战俘保特说，“战俘营里面是按着军队生活方式过着有组织的生活的，在伙食方面，我们有米饭和大豆吃。我们能够玩足球、排球和篮球等多种体育运动。翻译们还告诉我们世界新闻。”二十二名被遣返的英国战俘在回国途中经过新加坡时说，他们对于朝中战俘营的生活没有什么可以抱怨的。他们也从来没有看见过任何虐待战俘的事情。甚至驻朝鲜和日本的英联邦军总司令亨利·威尔斯也说：“从我们和被遣返的战俘们谈话中看来，我们还不知道有任何死亡行军或任何相类似的虐待事件。”
    在板门店采访的美国记者透露了美国通讯社散布这种耸人听闻的消息的秘密。据他们说，美国的哥伦比亚广播公司曾受到了美国国务院的谴责，因为它没有报道关于所谓“暴行”的消息。哥伦比亚广播公司打了个电报询问它在板门店的记者，为什么不报道这些所谓“暴行”，记者回电说，他是报道事实的。
    在板门店的美国记者们承认，他们的上级要他们制造关于所谓“暴行”的消息。他们说，合众社东京分社接到纽约来的电报说，“对遣返的战俘只需作有限的采访，除了关于暴行和耸人听闻的故事而外。”在这样的指示下面，美国记者们就大量制造关于所谓“暴行”的谎言了。法新社的一个记者报道说，这些记者纷纷向战俘提出问题询问，“或多或少巧妙地想从他们那里得到些耸人听闻的消息”。于是，关于所谓“暴行”的故事就制造出来了，但是这些故事几乎都是前后不符，矛盾百出的。法新社的记者说，“在没有摄影记者的闪光灯的时候，被遣返的战俘们所作的谈话看来就真实得多，有几个被遣返的战俘到日本后，在比较安静的环境中所作的谈话是和他们以前在朝鲜所说的相抵触的。”连合众社自己也承认，这些关于所谓战俘大批死亡的谎话都是对不起头来的。例如，关于所谓碧潼战俘营中战俘死亡的谎话，四个战俘就有四种相差很大的说法。
    美方这种无中生有的宣传，显然已经引起了世界舆论的不满。英国的“每日镜报”在四月二十四日发表题为“暴行乎？谎言乎？”的社论，提醒它的读者小心提防从朝鲜传来的关于所谓朝中方面的“暴行”的谎言。它说，美国的“愤怒的政客”正在利用这种故意制造出来的“仇恨宣传”“从事煽动”。“每日镜报”警告说：“美国政客们应该知道，他们不能提出战胜者的条件，目前并没有胜利，并没有无条件投降，目前的目标是用协议求得和平，仇恨宣传不会发生什么作用，可能只会延长战争。”
