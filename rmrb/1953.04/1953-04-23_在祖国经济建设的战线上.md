On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland

Carpenter Xie Shijun Creates Hand-Operated Plastering Machine

Carpenter Xie Shijun of the Harbin Seventh Housing Property Division of the former Qiqihar Railway Administration has achieved preliminary success in creating a hand-operated plastering machine, opening up a path for the mechanization of plastering work in the construction industry.

This plastering machine is highly efficient and produces high-quality plastering. With manual plastering, each person can only plaster 15 square meters per day; with the plastering machine, each person can plaster an average of 225 square meters per day, increasing efficiency by 14 times. Xie Shijun is currently continuing to research and improve this plastering machine. He wants to make an automatic ash feeder to replace manual ash feeding and is also trying to convert the hand-operated type to an electric one.

The Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is now helping Xie Shijun continue to research and improve the plastering machine and plans to organize a demonstration in the city to promote this new plastering tool in a guided manner.

Shaanxi Explores Oil and Innovates Drilling Methods

Large-scale oil exploration work is being carried out intensively in the Shaanxi area. To verify the underground oil reserves, exploratory wells thousands of meters deep must be drilled into the formation. Recently, a drilling team of a certain well drilling team in the Shaanxi area of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department has researched and developed a new drilling method of "heavy pressure, with appropriate rotation speed and large pump volume," which greatly accelerated the drilling speed, creating a new drilling record of safely drilling 406.90 meters of medium-hard strata in ten days, and a new record of drilling 109.49 meters per day. It also basically eliminated bouncing accidents, increased the utilization rate of roller drill bits by more than 60% above the quota, increased the monthly speed of the drilling rig by 2.2 times, and increased the average daily footage by 2.32 times.

Summarize the Advanced Textile Maintenance Work Experience Nationwide

From April 2 to 9, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China jointly held the National Textile Maintenance Conference in Shanghai, summarizing the nationwide advanced textile machinery maintenance methods, and determining the necessary maintenance system and reasonable maintenance organizational leadership forms. The new maintenance method is named "1953 Textile Machinery Maintenance Method."

Maintenance work is responsible for the maintenance and repair of machines to ensure the normal operation of machines. Whether this part of the work is done well directly affects the efficiency of machine production. In the past, various textile factories did not have sufficient understanding of this point, and there was a tendency to underestimate maintenance, which resulted in very low machine efficiency and affected the output and quality of yarn and cloth. The 1953 Textile Machinery Maintenance Method integrates the experience of various regions and absorbs the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so that machines that have been repaired can be as complete as new. The use of this method can extend the life of machines and reduce downtime, thereby promoting the further consolidation and development of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method.

Shenyang Cooperatives Support Basic Construction

The Shenyang cooperative system is actively organizing forces to support basic construction. Since February 28, the Shenyang Municipal Cooperative General Society and the offices in various districts have, under the instructions and assistance of the Cooperative Office of the Commercial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, gone deep into the engineering companies and construction sites to understand the actual situation, grasp the construction date, the number of employees, and the increase and decrease of employees during construction, and convened a meeting of directors of district consumer cooperatives. Finally, it was decided to establish 60 construction site service departments and mobile supply stations, and 13 service departments have now entered the construction site.

The service departments that have entered the construction site have been welcomed by the workers and supported by the party and government leaders at the site. The employee consumer cooperative of the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government entered the first site of the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metal Administration Bureau in Nanhu. All supplies there are very timely, and the cooperative often transports meat and vegetables to the construction site. The Xuechi Street Consumer Cooperative is actively researching the styles of shoulder pads, straw hats, etc. with the person in charge of the construction site and is preparing to make a large number of them. It has now begun to make lined and unlined clothes for the workers at the construction site.

Machine Farming Production Contract

On the 7th of this month, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Station and the Qianzhuang Collective Farm, which is being piloted in the Nanyuan District of Beijing, signed the 1953 machine farming production contract.

In the contract, both parties first determined the purpose of signing the contract, which is to use machine farming and adopt advanced agricultural science and technology to increase output and consolidate the farm. The various contents stipulated in the contract, as well as the obligations stipulated by both parties, are all based on this requirement. First, on the agricultural machinery station side, it is necessary to complete the machine farming task without compromise according to the agricultural production requirements of the farm. Agricultural technicians should be sent to regularly guide the agricultural technology of the farm. In 1953, three farm implement operators and drivers should be trained for the farm. Second, on the farm side, it is necessary to repair the field paths and bridges to ensure that machine operations are not affected. It is necessary to be responsible for the transportation and security of tractor fuel, as well as the living arrangements for the tractor team members. After the autumn harvest, the agricultural machinery station will be paid in cash an amount equivalent to the cost of animal power cultivation for each mu of land cultivated by machine. In order to fully demonstrate the superiority of mechanized collectivization, the contract also specifically states that the machine farming production team of the agricultural machinery station and the field production team of the farm should closely cooperate and carry out work according to the plan.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    木工谢世俊创造手摇抹墙机
    原齐齐哈尔铁路管理局哈尔滨第七房产分段木工谢世俊创造手摇抹墙机初步成功，为建筑工业中的抹灰作业走向机械化开辟了道路。
    这种抹墙机的效率很高，抹灰的质量也好。用人工抹灰，每人每天只能抹十五平方公尺；用抹墙机抹灰，平均每人每天可抹二百二十五平方公尺，效率提高十四倍。现在谢世俊正在继续研究改进这个抹墙机，他要做一个自动送灰器，代替人工添灰；还要设法把手摇式改为电动的。
    哈尔滨市总工会现在正帮助谢世俊继续研究改进抹墙机，并计划在市内组织一次表演，有领导地推广这一新式抹灰工具。陕北探勘石油创新钻井方法
    陕北地区大规模的石油探勘工作，正在紧张地进行着。为了证实地下石油的储藏量，要开钻深入地层数千公尺的探井。中央燃料工业部石油管理总局陕北区某钻井队最近研究出“重压、配合适当转速、大泵量”新钻井方法，大大加速了钻探的速度，创造了十天安全钻进四○六·九○公尺中硬地层的钻井新纪录，和日进一○九·四九公尺的新纪录。并基本上消灭了跳钻事故，使牙轮钻头使用率超过定额百分之六十，钻机月速度提高二·二倍，平均日进尺提高了二·三二倍。
