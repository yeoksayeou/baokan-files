Leadership organs at all levels in Shandong Province
    Improve Leadership Style and Working Methods in Spring Plowing

    Except for the Jiaodong Peninsula, where the sowing season is later and just beginning, most areas of Shandong Province have completed the sowing of early crops. The central task of current spring production is to continue to grasp sowing tightly, strive for full stands, and at the same time carry out drought prevention and resistance, rush to treat wheat frost damage, eliminate insect pests, strive for a bumper wheat harvest, and do a good job in production and disaster relief. Before and during spring plowing production, Shandong localities closely combined their work with the central task, and carried out struggles against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Therefore, new situations different from those of previous years have emerged.
    (1) The leading organs above the county and district levels have implemented the principle of making spring plowing production the overriding central task in rural areas, and have gradually overcome the decentralization of the various functional departments of the leading organs that do not combine with the central task, and the egalitarianism of the Party committee leadership that loses the center. The Party committee has strengthened the unified leadership of spring plowing production more than ever before. The Shandong Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convenes a joint meeting of cadres from provincial-level agriculture and forestry, supply and marketing cooperation, banks and other departments twice a week to study the situation of spring plowing production in a timely manner and solve specific problems related to spring plowing production. The number of meetings and reports are controlled, and various matters that hinder spring plowing production are suspended or postponed, so as to ensure that efforts are concentrated on doing a good job in spring plowing production. The phenomenon of "multiple departments issuing orders" and "arrows flying in all directions" has been initially overcome.
        (2) Leading organs at all levels have established and strengthened grass-roots work, and organized forces to conduct in-depth inspections and assist spring plowing work. This spring, in addition to the members of the Shandong Sub-bureau going to various places for inspection, a large number of cadres were drawn from the directly affiliated organs of the Sub-bureau and the Provincial People's Government to organize fourteen spring plowing production inspection teams, which went to fourteen special districts for inspection. Special districts and counties also organized a large number of cadres led by responsible cadres to go deep into the lower levels. The Shandong Sub-bureau issued a decision on establishing base-point counties in February, concentrating and unifying the forces of various departments to establish a unified base-point centered on production mutual assistance to drive other work, changing the past practices of various departments deviating from the center, dispersing forces, and conducting typical experiments in isolation. After the Spring Festival, more than 70 cadres, including the director of the sub-bureau and the director of the provincial government, were sent to the three base-point counties of Junan, Licheng, and Guangrao. The base points of leading organs at the special district and county levels have also been established, forming a wide base point network. In Laiyang Special District alone, 110 cadres were sent to the base points. The secretaries of the local Party committees in various places have successively focused on inspecting and organizing the work of base-point counties and districts. Such concentration and organization of a large number of cadres to establish base points and conduct in-depth inspection of spring plowing production is unprecedented.
        (3) In leading the spring plowing production, attention was paid to developing a democratic style, and the phenomenon of coercion and commandism was greatly reduced. Since the beginning of spring plowing in various places, through cadre meetings, people's representative meetings, and party member representative meetings at all levels, focusing on discussing spring plowing production, leading cadres took the lead in making self-criticism, carried out criticism and self-criticism, fully developed democracy, commended good people and good deeds, and exposed bad people and bad deeds; at the same time, serious violations of law and discipline were dealt with as a priority. When deploying spring plowing production tasks, many local leading cadres began to pay attention to starting from the specific situation, only making general requirements, not making specific figures, and concentrating on explaining policies and methods. This is very popular with district and township cadres. For example, in Yexian County, this method was used to deploy work at the county people's congress, and based on the serious coercion and commandism that occurred in the past in the promotion of agricultural implements, a resolution on "guaranteeing teaching and guaranteeing replacement" of walking plows and waterwheels was formulated in a realistic manner. The Linqi District Supply and Marketing Cooperative emphasized "knowing how to sell, teach, and use" in lending walking plows and waterwheels; emphasized seeking truth from facts and selling in stages and suitable for agricultural seasons in promoting bean cake work; The District Supply and Marketing Cooperative also organized working groups to go to the countryside to help the masses repair walking plows and waterwheels. The masses reacted well to these practices.
        (4) Starting from reality, facing the masses, summarizing the masses' production experience, finding out the key to increasing production in the local area, and specifically guiding the masses to increase production, a new method of leading production has begun to sprout in some counties. The Junan County Party Committee learned from the experience of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee in leading increased production, went deep into the masses, and summarized the masses' typical experiences of "ensuring seedling survival and full seedlings", Li Yueju's transformation of low-lying land, and Pan Yushan's transformation of mountain land, found out the key to increasing production in the local area, and pointed out the local goals for increasing production. Guangrao County, based on the soil conditions of the county, mobilized the masses to find out that the reasons for the decline in production over the years were that the land was alkaline, prone to drought, and difficult to preserve seedlings. It summarized the experience of resisting alkali, preventing drought, and preserving seedlings, changing the past practice of disregarding local soil conditions and only generally calling for more weeding, harrowing, and fertilizing, and launched a campaign to "resist alkali, prevent drought, preserve spring seedlings, and strive for a bumper wheat harvest", which was welcomed by the masses.
    The above are only preliminary changes in some areas. At present, there are still some problems in spring plowing production in Shandong Province that must be paid attention to and resolved.
        (1) In severely affected areas, production and disaster relief must be the overriding central task, overcoming laxity, paralysis, and panic, strengthening specific leadership, overcoming spring famine, and ensuring timely cultivation; and actively preparing to overcome summer famine.
        (2) It is necessary to continue to overcome the phenomena of egalitarianism and decentralization from the ideological understanding and the specific organization of work, from the leading organs to the grass-roots organizations in districts and townships. At present, in many areas, some work is still not controlled enough, which is still hindering the implementation of the central task. Some cadres in some departments believe that "taking production as the center" is a temporary measure during the spring plowing period, and wait for the spring plowing to end and still do their own thing. A cadre meeting in a certain township in the second district of Pingyin County deployed 20 tasks, and collecting movie fees became an urgent task. In Jiangshuigou Township, the twelfth district of Laiwu County, property insurance and land tax deeds have become the primary tasks. In a certain township in Linqi County, four cadres each deployed their personal work at a meeting, and no one cared about spring plowing production.
        (3) There are also some problems in the base point work that must be paid attention to and resolved: 1. There is insufficient understanding of the purpose of relying on base points to absorb work experience, change leadership styles, and train cadres. Therefore, establishing base points is not regarded as a fundamental measure to strengthen the leadership of rural work, long-term, constructive, and overcome bureaucracy, but as a temporary work, lacking long-term plans. 2. The cadres doing base point work are drawn from various departments. The unified leadership of the base point work team itself and the unified leadership of the local party committee of the county and district have not been well resolved in some places, which affects the progress of the base point work. 3. Some counties and districts lack experience in establishing base points, and too many base points have been established. For example, Shanxian County has set up 70 base points in 13 districts, dividing the forces and dispersing the strength.
    (4) There are still phenomena of plans not being in line with reality and stockpiling and out-of-stock of materials in supply and marketing and credit work; there are still phenomena of being divorced from reality in the promotion of agricultural production technology. For example, the masses in the seventh district of Guangrao County need loans for livestock, etc., but there are no such loans; the local area is alkaline land and cannot dig wells at all, but a large number of waterwheels and well-digging loans have been allocated. Some counties and districts in the Yishui and Huxi areas need a large number of seven-inch walking plows, but most of the allocated ones are ten-inch walking plows and other agricultural implements. The masses in Sanliushu Village in Guangrao County have five objections to the cadres' leadership of production: 1. Oppose blindly advocating more plowing and harrowing (because the local alkaline soil is prone to drought, and more plowing and harrowing will reduce production); 2. Oppose blindly advocating planting kenaf (because the local soil is not suitable for planting kenaf, and the products were not up to specifications and could not be sold last year); 3. Oppose blindly advocating planting alfalfa (because the alfalfa planted last year did not germinate); 4. Oppose blindly advocating artificial insemination of sheep (Last year, more than 100 sheep in Sanliushu Village were artificially inseminated, and not a single lamb was born); 5. Oppose blindly diverting water for irrigation (because the local alkaline clay soil becomes hard after winter irrigation, resulting in the death of more than 500 mu of wheat). In short, the masses oppose our subjective and unrealistic practices.
        (5) Some places have not closely combined spring plowing production with mutual assistance and cooperation, and promoted each other. At present, there are two basic problems in mutual assistance and cooperation: 1. Production activities are separated from mutual assistance and cooperation. Some places have not taken spring plowing production as the content, grasped the key issues of increasing production, and corrected blind advancement and formalism; instead, they have isolatedly reorganized mutual aid organizations by deviating from the center of production and deviating from reality. Some places are only busy with agricultural activities, abandon mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and do not reorganize, improve, and develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations in spring plowing production. 2. When correcting the tendency of blind advancement, the policy boundaries are unclear, and simple actions are taken, forcibly dismantling or canceling, making one mistake after another,打击群众的生产情绪，影响春耕生产.
    Some of these problems must be resolved immediately, and some need to be resolved gradually over a long period of time.

    山东省各级领导机关
    在春耕中改进了领导作风和工作方法
    山东省除胶东半岛因播种季节较晚，正在开始播种以外，大部地区已完成早期作物播种任务。当前春季生产的中心工作是继续抓紧播种，争取全苗，同时进行防旱抗旱、抢治小麦冻害、扑灭虫灾，争取小麦丰收，以及做好生产救灾工作。在春耕生产以前和在春耕生产中，山东各地密切结合中心工作，进行了反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。因此，出现了和往年不同的新的情况。
    （一）县、区以上各领导机关贯彻了以春耕生产为农村压倒一切的中心任务的方针，逐步克服了领导机关各业务部门不结合中心工作的分散主义和党委领导失掉中心的平均主义，空前集中地加强了党委对春耕生产的统一领导。中共中央山东分局每星期召集省级农林、供销合作、银行等部门干部联席会议两次，及时研究春耕生产情况，解决有关春耕生产的具体问题。对会议、表报加以控制，停办或缓办妨碍春耕生产的各项事情，确实保证集中力量，搞好春耕生产。“政出多门”“乱箭齐发”的现象已经初步克服了。
        （二）各级领导机关建立和加强了基点工作，并组织力量深入检查、帮助春耕工作。今春除山东分局委员分头到各地检查外，并由分局、省人民政府直属机关抽调大批干部组织了十四个春耕生产检查组，分赴十四个专区进行检查。专区、县两级也组织了大批干部由负责干部率领深入下层。山东分局在二月份发出了关于建立基点县的决定，集中统一了各部门的力量，建立以生产互助为中心带动其他工作的统一的基点，改变了各部门脱离中心、分散力量、各自孤立地进行典型试验的作法。在春节以后，就派出分局处长、省府厅长等七十余名干部分赴莒南、历城、广饶三个基点县。专区、县各级领导机关的基点也已建立起来，形成了一个广泛的基点网。仅莱阳专区派往基点的干部就有一百一十人。各地中共地委书记先后都着重地检查、组织了基点县、区的工作。这样集中和组织大批干部建立基点、深入检查春耕生产，是历年所没有的。
        （三）在领导春耕生产工作中注意了发扬民主作风，强迫命令的现象大为减少。各地春耕以来，通过各级干部会议、人民代表会议、党员代表会议，以讨论春耕生产为中心内容，领导干部带头检讨，开展批评与自我批评，充分发扬民主，表扬好人好事，揭露坏人坏事；同时，对严重违法乱纪事件作了重点处理。不少地方领导干部在布置春耕生产任务时，开始注意了从具体情况出发，只提总的要求，不提具体数字，集中精力交代政策和方法。这样做，极受区乡干部的欢迎。如掖县在县人民代表会上，采用了这样的方法布置了工作，并根据过去在推广农具中发生过的严重强迫命令现象，实事求是地制订了推广步犁、水车“保教、保换”的决议。临沂地区供销社在贷放步犁、水车中强调“会卖、会教、会用”；在推销豆饼工作中强调实事求是，分期推销，适合农时季节；专区供销社并组织工作组到乡村帮助群众修理步犁、水车。群众对于这些做法反映良好。
        （四）从实际出发，面向群众，总结群众生产经验，找出当地的增产关键，具体指导群众增产的新的领导生产的方法，已在一些县开始萌芽。莒南县委学习肇源县委领导增产的经验，深入群众，总结了群众“保苗全苗”、厉月举改造洼地、潘玉善改造山岭地的典型经验，找出了当地增产的关键，指出了当地增产的奋斗目标。广饶县根据本县土质条件，发动群众，找出历年减产的原因是地有碱、易旱、不易保苗，总结了抗碱、防旱、保苗的经验，改变了过去不顾当地土质条件，只一般号召多锄、多耙、多施肥的脱离实际的作法，开展了“抗碱、防旱、保住春苗齐全、争取小麦丰收”运动，得到群众的欢迎。
    以上这些还只是部分地区的初步的转变。目前山东省春耕生产中还有一些问题必须注意解决。
        （一）在受灾严重地区，要以生产救灾为压倒一切的中心工作，克服松懈麻痹和惊慌失措的思想，加强具体领导，战胜春荒，保证耕种适时；并积极进行战胜夏荒的准备工作。
        （二）要继续从思想认识上和工作的具体组织上，从领导机关到区乡基层组织，克服平均主义和分散主义现象。目前在不少地区，对某些工作仍然控制不够，还阻碍着中心任务的贯彻。有些部门的干部认为“把生产作为中心”是春耕期间临时的措施，等待着春耕结束后仍然各搞一套。平阴县二区某乡一次干部会就布置了二十项工作，收电影费成了紧急任务。莱芜县十二区江水沟乡房产保险、土地税契成了首要的工作。临沂县一个乡四个干部在一个会上各自布置个人的工作，春耕生产无人过问。
        （三）在基点工作中也还有一些问题，必须注意解决：一、对于依靠基点吸取工作经验、转变领导作风、培养干部的目的认识不足，因而没有把建立基点当做是加强农村工作领导的长期的、建设性的、克服官僚主义的一项根本措施，而当做是一个临时性的工作，缺乏长期打算。二、做基点工作的干部是从各部门抽调的，基点工作队的本身的统一领导以及同县区地方党委的统一领导问题，有些地方还没有很好地解决，影响基点工作的进行。三、有些县区对建立基点工作缺乏经验，基点建立过多。如单县十三个区共设了七十个基点，分兵把口，力量分散。
    （四）供销、信贷工作上仍有计划不切合实际和物资积压、脱销的现象；推广农业生产技术方面仍有脱离实际的现象。如广饶县七区群众需要牲畜等贷款，却没有这项贷款；当地是碱地，根本不能打井，却拨去大量的水车和打井贷款。沂水地区和湖西地区有些县区需要大量的七吋步犁，拨去的却多是十吋步犁和其他农具。广饶县三柳树村群众对干部领导生产有五个反对：一、反对盲目提倡多?、多耙（因为当地碱质土、易旱，多?多耙反要减产）；二、反对盲目提倡种洋麻（因为当地土质不宜种洋麻，去年提倡种洋麻，产品不够规格，无法销售）；三、反对盲目提倡种苜蓿（因为去年种的苜蓿不出苗）；四、反对盲目提倡羊的人工受精
    （去年三柳树一百多只羊，采取人工授精法，没有生一只小羊）；五、反对盲目引水灌溉（因当地碱性粘土，去冬灌溉后，土地坚硬，致死小麦五百多亩）。总之，群众反对我们主观主义脱离实际的做法。
        （五）有些地方还没有使春耕生产与互助合作密切结合，相互推动。当前互助合作的基本问题有两个：一、生产活动和互助合作脱节。有些地方没有以春耕生产为内容，抓住增产关键问题，纠正盲目冒进和形式主义；而是脱离生产中心、脱离实际去孤立地整理互助组织。有些地方只忙于农事活动，丢开互助合作组织，不在春耕生产中整理提高与发展互助合作组织。二、在纠正盲目冒进的偏向时，政策界限不清，简单从事，强迫拆散或取消，一错再错，打击群众的生产情绪，影响春耕生产。
    这些问题，有些必须立即解决，有些需要长期地逐步地解决。
