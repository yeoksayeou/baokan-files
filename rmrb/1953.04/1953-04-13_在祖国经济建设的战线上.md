    Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge Temporary Bridge Opens to Traffic
    After the completion of the temporary bridge project for the Yellow River Bridge on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the first train passed it on March 28th. Now, trains fully loaded with road construction materials are passing over the bridge day and night to transport them to the construction sections west of the Yellow River. Timber from Northeast China, cement from North China, steel rails rolled by Factory 101 in Southwest China, and hardware materials manufactured in East China and Northeast China are piled up on the west bank of the Yellow River like small mountain ranges. Various road construction machines that could not be transported by highway bridges in the past, such as mining and transport machines, and bridge-building vehicles, have also been successively transported to the west bank of the Yellow River.

    New Coal Seam Discovered at Wangjiayuan Mine in Pingxiang
    A new coal seam has been discovered at the Wangjiayuan Mine of the state-owned Pingxiang Mining Bureau, extending the mining time of an old mine shaft by fifteen years.
    This old mine shaft has been mined for a long time, and the coal reserves in the original mining area were nearing depletion, so it was originally planned to be abandoned. Later, the leadership of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, based on the speculation of some technicians and geologists that there might still be coal underground, decided to carry out drilling. After a long period of non-stop drilling, the drilling workers proved that there was indeed a 1,200-meter-long minable coal seam lying horizontally between the eastern and western faults below this mine shaft. This minable coal seam is divided into four layers, the thickest of which has an average thickness of 1.5 meters to 4 meters, with the thickest part reaching 6 meters. The reserves of this coal seam, calculated according to the currently planned annual output of the mine, will take fifteen years to mine.
    The basic construction design department of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau has been working hard to produce a design plan for mining this coal seam based on the underground data provided by the drilling, and has decided to continue excavating an inclined shaft downward from the middle of the original mine shaft for mining. This can save the state about 40% of the construction funds compared to excavating a vertical shaft separately.
    The construction of this inclined shaft has now started.

    Overhaul of the Mechanized Supply Station of Anshan Iron and Steel
    The mechanized supply station of Anshan Iron and Steel Company played a significant role last year. From April to December of last year, it transported more than 700,000 tons of general materials; if manual labor were used, it would take thousands of people more than a year to transport. Many of the materials and equipment needed for the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel last year were very heavy and large. Without mechanized lifting equipment, it would be difficult to complete this huge transportation task on time. However, after more than a year of intensive movement and transportation, many parts of the station's vehicles and machinery have become loose or worn, and a comprehensive and detailed overhaul must be carried out during the season when the work tasks are lighter to ensure the completion of this year's more arduous work tasks.
    In late January, the mechanized supply station of Anshan Iron and Steel Company began a large-scale overhaul. The major and medium overhauls have now been completed, and the overhauls that have not yet been completed include: 36 water pumps, 11 winches, 34 electric motors, 4 mixers, 16 automobiles, and 11 universal loaders. According to the current situation, except for a few machines (such as cranes and Brage-style automobiles) that cannot be completed quickly due to the temporary unavailability or inability to make parts, the mechanical overhaul of the entire station can be completed by April 15th.
    In this overhaul, all employees of the supply station actively tried to overcome many difficulties. When overhauling the chassis of the universal machine, it was discovered that the high-pressure oil ring was used up, and this part was difficult to buy temporarily; just when they were at a loss, repairman Liu Jianhua suggested connecting the broken oil ring, and the experiment proved that it could be used completely, solving the difficulty. The supply station did not have a drying oven, and more than 30 electric motors could not be repaired. Electrician Guan Fucheng took the electric stove from his home to use as a substitute, ensuring the smooth progress of the overhaul. Many purchasing staff also worked very hard. They often ran from Anshan to Shenyang, and from Shenyang to Dalian and Harbin... until they bought a part.

    Dujiangyan's Annual Repair Project Completed and Water Released in Sichuan
    The annual repair project of the Dujiangyan project in Sichuan Province has been successfully completed, and water was officially released on April 5th to irrigate more than 3 million mu of farmland in western Sichuan. Now the farmers in the western Sichuan Plain are busy with spring plowing and sowing.
    This year's Dujiangyan annual repair project focuses on both irrigation and flood control, focusing on the reconstruction of some permanent projects and strengthening water management. During this annual repair, hundreds of thousands of civilian workers participated in the construction, excavating more than 400,000 cubic meters of river earth, building 130,000 cubic meters of stone embankments, and installing more than 50,000 bamboo cages. This annual repair took some fundamental measures, merging 108 weirs and canals into 54, greatly changing the intricate and chaotic old face of the Dujiangyan water system. In order to gradually reconstruct the Dujiangyan project into a permanent project, bamboo cages in many places have been replaced with stone embankments; sluice dams for controlling flow have been built at major weir mouths, and two new-style sluice gates have also been built at the diversion outlets of the main streams.
    At the same time as this Dujiangyan annual repair, Peng County built a new 39-li long official canal weir, which can divert Dujiangyan water to expand the irrigation area by 235,000 mu.
    This year, the water management organization of Dujiangyan has been strengthened, and two first-class management stations and forty-nine second-class management stations have been added in the entire basin to guide and supervise the implementation of rotational irrigation in various places, eliminating the past phenomenon of upstream irrigation not taking care of downstream water use.

    Farmers Enthusiastically Help the Drilling Team
    The farmers in the villages near the Mountain ○1 drilling project of Benxi Coal and Iron Company are actively supporting the drilling project.
    When the first team of the drilling team in charge of the Mountain ○1 drilling project arrived at the construction site, the nearby farmers spread the good news and immediately warmly welcomed them, giving up their homes. Later, when the drilling team was preparing to build dormitories, the farmers spontaneously formed kang-building groups to help purchase straw, and quickly laid more than 30 new warm kangs. These farmers also actively participated in the construction preparation work of the drilling project. When transporting timber, the farmers dispatched many carts, and guaranteed that as long as the drilling team needed them, they would supply as many carts as needed. Farmers who had worked as carpenters enthusiastically signed up to participate in the work of the team's carpentry group, solving the team's shortage of carpenters. When some drilling machines began to test run, because the water pump had not been installed yet, the farmers in various villages dispatched many mule carts to transport water from several miles away to the construction site on the mountain. When the drilling team temporarily needed to borrow some buckets and hoes, the farmers even more automatically competed to lend them for use.

    兰新铁路黄河大桥便桥通车
    兰新铁路黄河大桥便桥工程完成后，已在三月二十八日通过第一列火车。现在满载筑路器材的列车正不分昼夜地通过此桥运往黄河以西工程地段。来自东北的木材，华北的水泥，西南一零一厂辗压的钢轨，华东、东北制造的五金器材，正像许多小山群一样堆积在黄河西岸。过去公路桥梁无法承负运输的各种筑路机器，如采运机、架桥车等，也已陆续运抵黄河西岸。（新华社）
    萍乡王家源矿场发现新煤层
    国营萍乡矿务局王家源矿场发现新煤层，使一口旧矿井延长开采时间十五年。
    这个旧矿井开采年代已经很久，原有采煤区域内的储煤已接近采完，原来准备废弃。后来萍乡矿务局领导方面根据有些技术人员和地质人员关于井下可能还有煤的推测，决定进行钻探。钻探工人经过长时间日夜不停地钻探以后，证明在这个矿井下部的东、西断层之间，果然还横躺着一块一千二百公尺长的可采煤层。这块可采煤层共分四层，其中最厚的一层，平均厚度为一点五公尺到四公尺，最厚的地方达六公尺。这块煤层的储量，按现在计划的矿井年产量计算，要十五年才能采完。
    萍乡矿务局基本建设设计部门根据钻探提供的地下资料，已紧张地赶制出开采这块煤层的设计方案，并决定从原矿井中部继续向下开凿一条斜井来进行开采，这样比另外开凿竖井可以给国家节省百分之四十左右的建设资金。
    现在，这个斜井开凿工程已经动工。（新华社）
    鞍钢机械化供应站大检修
    鞍山钢铁公司机械化供应站，在去年起了重大的作用。自去年四月到十二月，共运送了一般材料七十余万吨；如果用人工，上千的人要运一年多。鞍钢去年建设中所需要的物资和器材，很多都是很重很大的，如果没有机械化的起重设备，就很难按时完成这个巨大的运输任务。但是，经过一年多的紧张移动和运输，全站的车辆和机械，有很多部件都活动或磨损了，必须在工作任务较轻的季节里，抓紧进行一次普遍、细密的检修，方能保证完成今年更加繁重的工作任务。
    一月下旬，鞍钢机械化供应站开始了大规模的检修工作。现在大检修、中检修已经完成，已经开始检修还没有完成的有：水泵三十六台，卷扬机十一台，电动机三十四台，搅拌机四台，汽车十六台，万能装卸机十一台。根据目前情况看，除几种机械
    （如吊车和布拉格式汽车等）因零件一时买不到或做不出而不能很快完成外，全站的机械检修工作可于四月十五日全部完成。
    在这次检修工作中，供应站全体职工主动设法克服了许多困难。在检修万能机的底盘时，发现高压油圈用完了，而这种部件一时很难买到；正在无计可施时，修理工刘建华提议把坏油圈接起来，一试验完全可以用，把困难解决了。供应站没有干燥炉，三十余台电动机不能修理。电工关福诚主动把家里的电炉子拿来代用，保证了检修工作顺利进行。许多采购人员工作也很努力，他们常常为了采购一种部件，由鞍山跑到沈阳，由沈阳又跑到大连、哈尔滨……直到买到为止。
    四川都江堰岁修工程完工放水
    四川省都江堰工程的岁修工程，已胜利完工，并在四月五日正式放水，灌溉川西三百多万亩农田。现在川西平原的农民正紧张春耕播种。
    都江堰这次岁修工程，是以灌溉和防洪并重，重点改建了一些永久性工程，并加强了用水管理。这次岁修中，先后有数十万民工参加施工，共挖河方四十多万公方，砌石埂十三万公方，装竹笼五万多条。这次岁修作了一些治本措施，把一百零八条堰渠合并成五十四条，大大改变了都江堰水系错综杂乱的旧有面貌。为了使都江堰工程逐步改建为永久性工程，许多地方的竹笼已改砌为石埂；各大堰口都修建了节制流量的闸坝，主要干流的分水口也修建了两座新式水闸。
    和这次都江堰岁修的同时，彭县新修了一道三十九华里的官渠堰，可引都江堰水扩大灌溉面积二十三万五千亩。
    今年，都江堰的用水管理机构已有加强，在全流域增设了两个一等管理站和四十九个二等管理站，以指导和监督各地实行轮灌制，消除过去上游灌溉不照顾下游用水的现象。（新华社）
    农民们热烈帮助钻探队
    本溪煤铁公司山○一钻探工程附近的各村农民，都积极地支援钻探工程。
    当负责山○一钻探工程的钻探总队第一中队到达工地之后，附近的农民纷纷传告这一喜讯，立即热情招待，让出住房。后来，钻探总队准备建筑宿舍，农民们又自动组成打炕小组，帮助购买谷草，很快地铺成了三十多个新暖炕。这些农民还积极参加钻探工程的施工准备工作。搬运木材时，农民出动了很多大车，并提出保证说：只要钻探队需要，要多少辆，一定就给供应多少辆。曾经当过木工的农民，热烈报名参加该队木工组工作，解决了该队木工不足的困难。当部分钻探机开始试转时，因为水泵还没有安装好，各村农民又出动了许多骡车，从几里地以外往山上工地运水。钻探队临时要借用一些水桶、镐头，农民们更是自动争先地借给使用。
