    The CCP Anda County Committee, Heilongjiang Province, Corrects the Deviation of Credit Cadres Forcing Farmers to Store Livestock
    In the winter of 1952, the Cooperative Union of Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, trained a group of credit officers who, led by cadres from the County Cooperative Union, went to Jubao Village in the county to establish credit departments for cooperatives. After arriving in the village, these cadres held three registration meetings to establish credit departments, mobilizing farmers to store "surplus" livestock. When they publicized the benefits of establishing credit departments, they talked wildly about the prospects of socialism, saying, "In a socialist society, there will be houses with multiple floors, electric lights, telephones, bathhouses inside the houses, meals with one hundred and seventy dishes, and continuous eating for fourteen hours." The farmers immediately questioned, "Then will we still work? How can we eat those dishes?" They were speechless. Then they promoted, "Establishing a credit department is a good thing, medicine for illness, buying coffins when you die, we'll take care of everything." This made the farmers even more suspicious, and no one dared to store their livestock in the credit department. They then forced the cadres to take the lead in storing, and as a result, all six cadres in the village stored their horses in the credit department. The Party branch secretary stored two horses, and his father cried, saying, "In the past, I couldn't bear to sell them even when I was sick, but now the credit department has forcibly taken them away." Although these cadres took the lead in storing, they still couldn't motivate all the farmers in the village. They became very angry and, holding a list of households with horses, said to the village cadres, "The 'society' is coming soon, those who dream of three horses, two cows, a warm bed, wife and kids are rich peasant thinking." They also said fiercely to the masses at the meeting, "Those who have many horses don't speak up, don't be polite, bring them out," "If you don't say it yourself, we'll write it down for you house by house." Under such coercion, the farmers in the village stored twenty-two horses, five cows, and two sheep in the credit department. This long-term storage of livestock was practically the same as selling the livestock, only with monthly interest payments. After the credit department was established, the livestock was lent to farmers who had no or few horses. All nine households in the village without horses each received a horse unconditionally. Farmers Su Fuhe and Xu Fenghe, both of whom cultivated two hectares of land and each had a horse, each received another horse. These farmers with horses wanted to refuse, but the cadres asked them to cultivate more land. The loafer Wei Jingyu, who had no horse, unexpectedly got a horse. He smugly went around bragging, "We didn't spend any money, and we have good horses to use; if we don't have fodder, I think the credit department will have to solve it for us!" The farmers with horses were very frightened. Farmer Wang Huaqing said to the village head, "It would have been better if I hadn't bought a horse in the first place. I didn't expect that after saving money to buy a horse, I would have to lend it to others. I won't save money anymore." Farmer You Chaodong said, "I really don't understand what's going on these days, the poorer you are, the better the impression the superiors have of you." Within ten days of the establishment of the credit department, the whole village slaughtered forty sheep and sold two cows and two carts. The Chinese Communist Party Anda County Committee discovered this deviation and immediately instructed to dissolve the credit department, return the livestock to their original owners, criticized the relevant personnel, re-explained the credit policy, and began planning to establish a new credit department.

    中共黑龙江省安达县委员会纠正信贷干部强迫农民储存耕畜的偏向
    一九五二年冬，黑龙江省安达县合作社联合社训练出一批信贷员，由县合作社联合社干部带领到该县巨宝村，进行成立合作社信贷部的工作。这些干部到村后连开了三次成立信贷部报名大会，动员农民存储“多余的”耕畜。他们在宣传成立信贷部的好处时，胡乱讲社会主义的前途，说什么“社会主义社会，楼上楼下，电灯电话，澡塘子修在屋里，一顿饭吃一百七十个菜，一连坐着吃十四个钟头。”农民就当场质问说：“那还干不干活呢？那些菜咋吃法呢？”他们无言对答。接着他们又宣传说：“办信贷部是好事，有病吃药，死了买棺材，都给你办。”这更引起农民怀疑，没人敢把牲口存在信贷部里。他们就强迫干部带头储存，结果全村六个干部把马存在信贷部里。党支部书记存了两匹马，他父亲大哭，说：“过去有病也舍不得卖，现在信用部硬拉去了。”虽然这些干部带头存，但仍然带不起全村农民，他们便大发脾气，拿着有马户的名单对村干部说：“快到‘社会’了，想三匹马两头牛，老婆孩子热炕头的人，都是富农思想。”又在大会上对群众暴躁地说：“马多的人不说话，就别客气，给他端出来”，“自己不说，就挨家给他写。”在这样强迫下，全村农民存入信贷部二十二匹马，五头牛，两只羊。这种长期存放耕畜的办法，实际是和把耕畜卖掉一样，只不过按月收些利息。信贷部成立后，就把牲畜贷给无马或少马的农民。全村九家无马户，无条件地各得到一匹马。农民苏富和、徐凤和两家都是种两垧地，各有一匹马，这次每家各得一匹。这些有马的农民想拒绝不要，但干部要求他们多种些地。二流子无马户魏景玉意外地得到一匹马，他得意洋洋地到处卖乖说：“咱们没化钱，还有好马用；没有草料，我看信贷部也得给咱解决呢！”而有马户都非常恐慌。农民王化清对村长说：“当初不买马就好了，想不到省吃俭用买匹马，还得贷给别人用，以后再不攒钱啦。”农民尤朝栋说：“真不明白这年头是怎么回事，谁穷上级就对他印象好。”信贷部成立后十几天，全村杀了四十只羊，卖了两头牛，两辆大车。中国共产党安达县委会发现这一偏向，立即指示解散了这个信贷部，把耕畜退还给原主，并对有关人员进行了批评，重新交代信贷政策，酝酿另行成立新的信贷部。    （宋世宜）
