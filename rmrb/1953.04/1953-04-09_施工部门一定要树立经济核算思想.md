    Construction Departments Must Establish an Economic Accounting Mindset

    The Second Engineering Company of the Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau contracted 208,000 square meters of construction projects in Shenyang last year. Except for the quality issues that occurred at the Metallurgical Pavilion of the Northeast Institute of Technology, the quality of other projects was not bad. During the construction process, due to the implementation of parallel flow operations organized according to instruction charts, the construction period of each project was shortened and completed ahead of schedule. Their work has achieved certain results. However, according to the recent inspection report of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's inspection team, the waste they generated during construction was quite alarming.

    The reasons for the waste, in addition to the design work lagging behind the construction requirements, the poor design quality, and the constant modification of the design during construction, resulting in serious rework and waste, from the perspective of the construction department, the most important reason is the lack of economic accounting concepts among leading cadres. They one-sidedly understood the completion of the state's basic construction plan as simply "building large buildings on schedule." Therefore, the construction plan only included project progress plans, but no material consumption quotas and no cost reduction plans. During the construction process, in order to rush the progress, they disregarded costs and did not hesitate to violate financial regulations. Individual leading cadres also mistakenly believed that "stricter regulations would affect the project progress." Many technical cadres also believed that their task was only to ensure quality and progress, and as for economic accounting, "that is the business of the financial department!" Because leading cadres generally lacked an economic accounting mindset, many of the workers' savings actions were not encouraged and supported. Red banner competitions only evaluated progress and quality, but not savings. Workers picked up more than 5,000 kilograms of nails on the construction site and handed them over to the trade union. Some workers tried to use waste materials to make box boards, etc., but did not receive timely rewards and praise. The workers said, "Our savings are wasted." They expressed extreme heartache about the serious waste on the construction site and said, "Our construction site is paved with gold," "Our buildings are piled up with money!"

    It is undeniable that we are starting large-scale economic construction for the first time, we still lack experience in construction management, and our technical level and cadre strength are far behind the objective requirements. Some waste is inevitable. Because of this, we must thoroughly examine the shortcomings and errors in our work, summarize the experience and lessons in this regard, and conscientiously study our business. The many serious waste phenomena that exist in the Second Engineering Company are also widespread in other engineering companies across the country, and some units may be even more serious. In order to better complete this year's basic construction tasks, all construction departments must launch a mass struggle against waste and against the phenomenon of no one being responsible, vigorously expose the shortcomings in the work, expose the bureaucracy of the leadership, and through concrete facts, educate all employees to establish a strong economic accounting perspective, and establish and improve construction management systems, especially the responsibility system.

### 施工部门一定要树立经济核算思想

    施工部门一定要树立经济核算思想
    东北有色金属管理局第二工程公司去年在沈阳承包了二十万八千平方公尺的建筑工程，其中除了东北工学院冶金专馆曾发生质量事故外，其他工程质量都不坏。施工过程中，由于推行了按指示图表组织平行流水作业，各工程都缩短了工期，提前完工。他们的工作是有一定成绩的。但是，根据重工业部检查组最近的检查报告，他们在施工中的浪费现象，也是颇为惊人的。
    产生浪费的原因，除了设计工作落后于施工要求，设计质量低劣，一边施工一边修改设计，因而造成严重的返工浪费以外，从施工部门看来，最主要的还是领导干部缺乏经济核算观点。他们把完成国家基本建设计划片面地理解为就是“按期盖好大楼”。因此，在施工计划中只有工程进度计划，没有材料消耗定额，没有降低成本的计划；在施工过程中，为了抢进度，就不计工本，不惜破坏财务制度。个别领导干部还错误地认为
    “制度严了，反而影响工程进度。”许多技术干部也认为他们的任务只是保证质量、保证进度，至于经济核算，“那是财务部门的事”！由于领导干部普遍缺乏经济核算思想，工人们的许多节约行动也得不到鼓励和支持。红旗竞赛中只评进度、评质量，不问节约。工人们在工地拣起了五千多公斤钉子送交工会，有的工人想办法利用废料做盒子板等，都没有及时受到奖励和表扬。工人们说：“我们省了也是白省。”他们对工地中严重浪费现象极表痛心地说：“我们的工地是黄金铺地”，“我们的大楼是用钱堆起来的！”
    不容否认：我们第一次开始大规模的经济建设，我们还缺乏施工管理的经验，我们的技术水平和干部力量还远远落后于客观的要求，若干浪费现象是不可避免的。正因为这样，我们必须深入地检查工作中的缺点和错误，总结这一方面的经验教训，认真地学习业务。第二工程公司所存在的许多严重浪费现象在全国其他工程公司中同样是普遍存在的，有些单位可能还更严重。为了更好地完成今年基本建设任务，所有建筑工程部门都必须开展群众性的反对浪费、反对无人负责现象的斗争，大力揭发工作中的缺点，揭发领导方面的官僚主义，通过具体事实，教育全体职工树立坚强的经济核算观点，建立和健全施工管理制度，特别是责任制度。
