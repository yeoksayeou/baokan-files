The Central Grain Ministry convened the First National Grain Storage and Transportation Conference in Beijing on March 6th, determining the national grain transfer and storage work tasks for 1953 and formulating specific plans and measures.

At the meeting, the work of the central and local grain departments was first reviewed. Due to a lack of understanding of warehouse distribution, grain inventory, and data in the past, the formulated transportation plans were divorced from reality, and plans were revised repeatedly during implementation. Therefore, the work became a temporary, rush task. In October of last year alone, local authorities changed plans as many as ten times, and temporary tasks in September of last year exceeded the original plan by more than double. This resulted in serious irrational phenomena in transportation, such as reciprocal, roundabout, and reverse transportation, wasting huge amounts of packaging and freight costs, and preventing timely grain supply in some areas. At the same time, many units, only seeking convenience for their own local work and lacking accurate information, resulted in irrational use of warehouses and serious accumulation of materials (especially sacks). These hindered the reduction of grain expenditure levels. This was caused by a lack of meticulous supply system management thinking, localism, and bureaucratic work style. In the future, in order to strengthen the planning of work and gradually implement an economic accounting system and quota management, the meeting discussed and determined six main tasks for grain storage and transportation work in 1953: First, strengthen transportation planning: based on the national grain allocation plan, formulate annual, quarterly, and monthly transportation plans in a timely manner to ensure military needs and the needs of major markets. Second, take stock of assets: clarify the numbers of warehouses, grain, and materials to lay the foundation for asset inventory and verification. Third, ensure grain safety, continue to implement the principle of "prevention is better than cure," and effectively grasp grain changes during the severe rainy season, strive for initiative, and effectively prevent insect and mold damage. Fourth, implement quota management on a trial basis in grain warehouses: a comprehensive trial implementation will be carried out in the six northeastern provinces and eight major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an; a key trial implementation will be carried out in thirteen provinces including Henan and four cities including Kunming to gain experience and gradually promote it. Fifth, grasp the laws of storage and transportation and improve technology. Sixth, be meticulous in calculations, strengthen planning, select transportation routes, rationally organize transportation tools, reduce losses, and complete the savings tasks. In addition, various specific plans and measures were also studied and formulated.

Among the above six main tasks, Minister of the Central Grain Ministry Zhang Naiqi also particularly emphasized that taking stock of assets and grasping the regularity of grain storage and transportation are important keys to strengthening work planning, and responsible comrades of grain departments at all levels should pay special attention to this. Especially the current inventory and transfer work, the task is heavy, and more specific leadership should be given, and efforts should be made to do a good job.

### 中央粮食部确定今年粮食储运工作任务

    中央粮食部确定今年粮食储运工作任务
    中央粮食部于三月六日在北京召开第一次全国粮食储运会议，确定了一九五三年全国粮食调运及保管工作任务，并制定了具体计划与办法。
    会上首先检查了中央及各级粮食工作部门的工作：由于过去对仓库的分布，库存粮数及资料等不摸底，制定的运输计划脱离实际，计划执行中一改再改，因此，工作都成了临时突击任务。仅去年十月份各地变更计划达十次之多，去年九月份临时任务竟超过原计划一倍以上，这就造成了运输上的严重的相向、迂回、倒运的不合理现象，浪费了巨额包装、运费，并使个别地区的粮食供应不能及时。同时，由于不少单位只图自己本位工作方便以及心中无数，致仓库使用不合理，而且积压资材（尤其麻袋）也很严重。这些都阻碍了粮食费用水平的降低。这是缺乏精打细算的供给制经营思想、本位主义和官僚主义作风所造成的。今后为了加强工作的计划性，逐步实行经济核算制、实行定额管理，会议讨论结果，确定了一九五三年粮食储运工作六项主要任务：第一、加强运输计划：根据全国粮食调度计划，及时制定年度、季度和月度运输计划，保证军需和主要市场需要。第二、摸清家底：搞清仓库、粮食、资材数字，打下清产核资基础。第三、确保粮食安全，继续贯彻“防重于治”的方针，在霉雨严重季节，切实掌握粮食变化情况，争取主动，有效地防治虫、霉危害。第四、粮食仓库试行定额管理：在东北六省和北京、天津、沈阳、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等八大城市全面试行，在河南等十三个省和昆明等四个市重点试行，取得经验，逐步推广。第五、掌握储运各种规律，提高技术。第六、精打细算、加强计划，选择运输路线，合理组织运输工具，减少损耗，完成节约任务。此外，并研究和制定了各项具体的计划及办法。
    在以上六项主要任务中，中央粮食部章乃器部长并特别强调指出：摸清家底、掌握粮食储运的规律性是加强工作计划性的重要关键，各级粮食部门负责同志应特别重视。尤其目前的清查、调运工作，任务重大，更应具体领导，努力作好。
