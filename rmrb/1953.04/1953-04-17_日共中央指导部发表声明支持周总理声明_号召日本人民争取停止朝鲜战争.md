    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Central Steering Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on April 1st supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations issue.
    The Japanese Communist Party's statement said: The statement by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China suggesting the resumption of armistice negotiations has aroused great reactions throughout the world.
    This suggestion is a concentrated expression of the demands and strength of the world peace camp. It is a major blow to the world war camp. In particular, Japan's remilitarization advocates are greatly alarmed. Stock prices on the London and Tokyo stock markets plummeted, and commodity markets also experienced sharp declines. The munitions industry suffered a major blow. This is because people all over the world, in order to avoid war, are demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and are raising their hands in approval of Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal.
    The statement pointed out: In Japan, workers across the country have stood up to support the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's demand, put forward not long ago, for an immediate end to the Korean War, and are beginning to appeal to people in other social strata. Farmers are also demanding an end to the Korean War, a reduction in fertilizer prices, supplies to rural areas, and the import of Chinese soybean cakes. Small and medium-sized entrepreneurs are demanding that war industries be transformed into peaceful industries, developing Sino-Japanese trade to find a way out, and clearing out unsold goods. This situation gives unlimited courage to those who demand guaranteeing the unlimited development of peaceful industries, promoting the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade, guaranteeing the victory of people's diplomacy, and advancing Japan's independence and liberation movement.
    The statement emphasized: We believe that Premier Zhou Enlai's statement represents the demands of peace-loving people of all countries, and therefore we have decided to support it.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata" (Red Flag), published an editorial on April 6th on Premier Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the Korean armistice negotiations, saying: The statements by Premier Zhou Enlai, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov have given the people of the world who demand peace powerful confidence and bright hope. Today, people all over the world are eagerly looking forward to lasting world peace, hoping that the Korean War can be resolved as soon as possible. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement correctly answered the demands of the peace-loving people of the world. The Japanese Communist Party fully agrees with and supports this statement.
    The editorial said: The Japanese people today are under the rule of American imperialism and its running dogs, their lives and property destroyed by its policy of remilitarization, their freedom deprived, and their national independence lost. In such a life full of suffering, the Japanese people demand peace and independence and are carrying out a glorious struggle for national liberation against the US-Japan reactionaries; the people's revolution has made great strides forward. Precisely because of this struggle, the provocative and adventurous policies of the US-Japan reactionaries cannot be easily realized, and they are becoming increasingly mired in chaos. The Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence, as a struggle against the US imperialist base in Asia, is an important link in the struggle to defend world peace.
    The editorial continued: The US imperialists' attempt to forcefully promote policies of war and oppression has caused sharp contradictions and antagonism in the Japanese reactionary camp. They are attempting to take advantage of the dissolution of the Diet to establish a second Yoshida government on a stronger foundation. However, they have encountered opposition aroused by the people's fiery national indignation.
    Prime Minister Yoshida is deceiving the people with the outrageous lie of "opposing remilitarization and safeguarding the democratic constitution!" However, this Yoshida government is actually a loyal running dog of US imperialism, providing the United States with bases for bombing Korea, militarizing Japanese industry for the United States, and attempting to turn the Japanese into mercenaries for the United States. They are attempting to maintain the rule and interests of the Japanese reactionaries in this way.
    The editorial emphasized: The Japanese people will resolutely not allow a second or third Yoshida government to reappear in this general election. All patriots must unite and struggle for the establishment of a government of their own people based on the demands of the Japanese people. This is the only force that will bring peace and independence, freedom and prosperity.

    日共中央指导部发表声明支持周总理声明
    号召日本人民争取停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央指导部在四月一日发表声明，支持周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明。
    日本共产党的声明说：中华人民共和国总理周恩来建议恢复停战谈判的声明，已在全世界引起极大的反应。
    这个建议是世界和平阵营的要求和力量的集中表现。它给世界战争阵营以很大的打击。特别是日本的重整军备论者感到很大的恐慌。伦敦、东京的各股票市场股票价格狂跌，各商品市场也发生猛跌现象，军需工业遭到很大的打击。这是因为全世界人民为了避免战争，都在要求立即停止朝鲜战争，对于周恩来总理的建议举起双手表示赞成。
    声明指出：在日本，全国工人已经挺起身来支持日本工会总评议会在不久以前提出的立即停止朝鲜战争的要求，并正在开始向其他阶层的人士发出号召。农民也要求停止朝鲜战争，减低肥料价格，供应农村，并输入中国的豆饼。中小企业家要求把战争工业转变为和平工业，发展日中贸易来找出一条活路，清除滞销货物。这种情况给要求保证和平工业的无限发展、促进日中贸易的恢复、保证人民外交的胜利、推进日本独立和解放运动的人们增加了无限的勇气。
    声明强调说：我们认为周恩来总理的声明代表了爱好和平的各国人民的要求，因此我们决定予以支持。
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”在四月六日就周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明发表社论说：周恩来总理、金日成首相、莫洛托夫外交部长的声明，给了全世界要求和平的人民以强大的信心和光明的希望。今天全世界人民正在殷切地盼望着世界的持久和平，希望朝鲜战争能够早日获得解决。周恩来总理的声明正确地回答了全世界盼望和平的人民的要求。日本共产党完全赞成和拥护这个声明。
    社论说：日本人民今天是处在美帝国主义和它的走狗的统治下，被它的恢复军国主义的政策破坏了生活和财产，剥夺了自由，丧失了民族的独立。日本人民在这样充满苦闷的生活中要求和平和独立，向美、日反动派进行着民族解放的光荣斗争；人民革命有了大步的前进。就因为有这样斗争，不仅使美、日反动派的挑衅冒险政策不能轻易实现，而且使他们愈来愈陷于混乱。日本人民争取和平和独立的斗争，作为向美帝国主义在亚洲的据点所进行的斗争，是拥护世界和平的斗争的重要环节之一。
    社论接着说：美帝国主义者企图强力推行战争和压迫的政策，引起日本反动阵营的尖锐矛盾和对立。他们企图利用解散国会，在更强大的基础上建立第二个吉田政府。但是他们遭到人民炽烈的民族义忿所激起的反对。
    吉田首相以漫天的大谎“反对重整军备，维护民主宪法！”在欺骗人民。然而这个吉田政府实在就是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，给美国提供轰炸朝鲜的基地，为美国而使日本工业军事化，为美国而企图把日本人变成雇佣兵。他们企图这样来维持日本反动派的统治和利益。
    社论强调说：日本人民在这次大选中坚决不容许第二个、第三个吉田政府重新出现。全体爱国人士都团结起来，以日本人民的要求为基础，为建立人民自己的政府而斗争。这是带来和平和独立、自由和繁荣的唯一的力量。
