Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 18th: The Japanese House of Representatives election is to be held on the 19th. The Japanese Communist Party issued a letter to workers on the 15th, calling on the Japanese working class to actively participate in the general election struggle and cast their votes for the Japanese Communist Party and all patriotic candidates who oppose rearmament.
    The message stated: As this Japanese general election struggle is underway, people around the world are launching a great struggle for peace and are vehemently demanding an end to the Korean War. People around the world are paying attention to the Japanese people's general election struggle against Japanese rearmament.
    The message pointed out: The Yoshida Liberal Party government, which defies the world's peace forces and stubbornly pursues rearmament, is preparing to launch a new and fierce attack on the working class after the general election. The situation after the last general election illustrates this. If the Yoshida Liberal Party's conspiracy succeeds in the general election, it will pass some fascist bills that failed to be established in the previous Diet to undermine the struggle and organization of the working class; and it will also revise the constitution to implement a large-scale conscription system for rearmament.
    The Yoshida Liberal Party government is truly a primary enemy of the Japanese working class, and they must not be allowed to reorganize the government again.
    After listing a series of heroic struggles of the Japanese working class since the "May Day" festival in 1952, the message stated: Farmers, citizens, youth, women, and national capitalists across the country hope to get help from the working class and demand that the working class stand at the forefront of the people of the country. The working class must exert its great power to carry out the general election struggle against the Yoshida Liberal Party government. The working class must become the main force in strengthening the patriotic front for peace and independence.
    The message issued a call: Worker brothers! Elect the Japanese Communist Party and patriotic candidates who are fighting for peace and national liberation into the Diet. Cast your votes for the Japanese Communist Party and all patriotic candidates who oppose rearmament, safeguard the lives and rights of the working people, and fight to overthrow the Yoshida Liberal Party government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 18th: Patriotic United Front candidates Tametoku Saburo (independent), Kazahaya Yatsuji (Communist Party), and Horie Yuichi (Communist Party), who are running for Diet members in the Tokyo constituency, held a "United Election Policy Speech Meeting" in Shibuya Station Square, Tokyo, on the 4th. Renowned peace fighter and Senator Ikuo Oyama also participated in the speech meeting. The speech meeting attracted a large audience, who enthusiastically responded to the speakers' call to overthrow the Yoshida government.
    Tametoku Saburo pointed out in his speech: "The Yoshida government keeps saying that it will not implement rearmament, but behind the scenes it is repeatedly creating a fait accompli." He said: We must develop friendly relations between Japan and China and realize peace, so that we can smash the ambitions of the Yoshida government and the United States. Kazahaya Yatsuji then gave a speech saying: A new force that truly safeguards the happiness of the nation is growing, and we must unite this force. The Communist Party is willing to struggle to complete this difficult task. I hope everyone will urge us to move forward together. He pointed out: "Establishing a new people's government depends on everyone's strength."
    Ikuo Oyama also gave a speech, emphasizing: If someone asks who should be elected, just look at who has been fighting for peace, risking their lives, until now. Now is the time to elect communists and warriors like Mr. Tametoku Saburo into the Diet.

    日共号召日本工人阶级选举爱国候选人
    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：日本国会众议员选举即将在十九日举行。日本共产党在十五日发表告工人书，号召日本工人阶级积极参加大选斗争，把选票投给反对重整军备的日本共产党和所有的爱国的候选人。
    文告说：在这次日本大选斗争进行时，世界人民正在展开争取和平的伟大斗争，并且在风起云涌地要求结束朝鲜战争。世界人民注意着日本人民为反对日本重整军备而进行的大选斗争。
    文告指出：不惜反抗世界和平力量、执意推行重整军备的吉田自由党政府，正在进行准备，以便在大选以后向工人阶级发动新的猛烈攻击。上次大选以后的情形说明了这一点。吉田自由党阴谋如果在大选中获胜，就要通过在上届国会中未能成立的一些法西斯法案，以破坏工人阶级的斗争和组织；并且还要修改宪法，实行大规模重整军备的征兵制度。
    吉田自由党政府才真正是日本工人阶级的一个首要敌人，决不能再听凭他们重新组织政府。
    文告在列举自一九五二年“五一”节以来日本工人阶级的一系列的英勇斗争以后说：全国的农民、市民、青年、妇女、民族资本家都希望得到工人阶级的帮助，要求工人阶级站在全国人民的最前列。工人阶级要拿出他们伟大的力量，来进行反对吉田自由党政府的大选斗争。工人阶级要成为加强和平与独立的爱国战线的主力。
    文告发出号召说：工人兄弟们！把为争取和平与民族解放而斗争的日本共产党和爱国的候选人选进国会去。把选票投给反对重整军备、保障劳动人民的生活和权利、为打倒吉田自由党政府而斗争的日本共产党和所有的爱国的候选人。
    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：在东京选区进行国会议员竞选的爱国统一战线候选人淡德三郎（无党派）、风早八十二（共产党）、堀江邑一（共产党）等，四日在东京涩谷车站广场举行“统一竞选发表政见演讲会”。著名和平战士、参议员大山郁夫也参加了这个演讲会。演讲会吸引了大量听众，他们热烈地响应演讲者关于打倒吉田政府的号召。
    淡德三郎在演讲会上指出：“吉田政府口口声声说不实行重整军备，可是在背地里一再造成既成事实。”他说：我们要发展日中友好关系、实现和平，这样就可以粉碎吉田政府和美国的野心。风早八十二接着发表演讲说：真正维护民族幸福的新的力量正在成长，我们要把这种力量团结起来。共产党愿为完成这个困难的任务而斗争。希望大家督促我们共同前进。他指出：“建立新的人民的政府，要依靠大家的力量。”
    大山郁夫也发表了演讲，他强调说：假如有人问应该选举那一个人，只要看一看是谁在过去不顾性命地为和平而一直斗争到现在，就可以知道了。现在正应该把共产党员和像淡德三郎先生这样的战士选进国会里面去。
