    Tianjin Steel Plant Achieves Balanced Monthly Production
    Exceeds First Quarter Production Plan
    The Tianjin Steel Plant has exceeded its first-quarter production targets and has achieved monthly plan fulfillment. In March, each workshop averaged twenty-five days of daily plan fulfillment.

    The plant's 1953 production, financial, and technical plans are all higher than last year's increased production and savings plans. For example, ingot production increased by 14.14 percent; steel increased by 5.58 percent. In terms of quality, the goal is to meet the newly promulgated national steel standards in the second quarter. Although the plans are much higher than last year, they were overfulfilled in January, February, and March due to the efforts of all employees. In total, first-quarter ingot production reached 101.44 percent of the plan; steel bar production: the small rolling mill completed 103.65 percent, the medium rolling mill completed 134.12 percent; galvanized iron wire completed 102.88 percent. In terms of quality, the qualified rate of steel ingots exceeded the plan by 0.92 percentage points; the qualified rate of 25mm round steel exceeded the plan by 0.66 percentage points, and the 10mm round steel exceeded by 0.1 percentage points. The cost reduction plan for January was fully completed, and the consumption quotas of major raw materials in February and March were lower than planned.

    The plant's ability to fulfill and exceed its production plans on a monthly basis is mainly due to the following measures:

    1. Implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, promoting advanced experience, and earnestly adopting rationalization proposals put forward by the masses. For example, the open-hearth smelting learned the Soviet rapid steelmaking method, and the Yang Xi'en operation method emerged, which improved both output and quality; the galvanizing workshop promoted the Xiao Changqing work method, which improved quality; the wire drawing workshop promoted the Zhang Junrong-created double-die, three-hopper operation method, which increased output by nearly one time; the rolling mill implemented the Soviet expert's suggestion, reducing the steel ingot burning loss rate from more than 60 kilograms to more than 30 kilograms.

    2. Strengthening safety work and reducing accidents. In the past, the plant did not seriously implement the regular maintenance system. When there was a problem with the machine, it was always "used as it is." When an accident occurred, they would be in a hurry and waste more time repairing it, so that balanced production could not be carried out according to the operation plan. In January of this year, they solved major safety production issues such as the ventilation of the electric furnace for smelting ferromanganese and the safety cover of the wire rod mill's rolling mill. In February, they stepped up the maintenance of machinery and equipment, solved dozens of maintenance problems, reduced temporary machine failures, and improved operating efficiency. The number of work-related injuries in February decreased by four compared with January, and no accidents occurred in the first, second, and third branch plants throughout the month. In March, a major security inspection was carried out, and the problems identified were earnestly resolved, which played a significant role in ensuring balanced production.

    3. Leading cadres go deep into workshops and teams to strengthen the leadership of balanced production according to the operation plan. In January, under the leadership of the Party branch, the shortcomings of having too many meetings and too little time for production research were corrected. In February, the emphasis was placed on carrying out balanced production according to the operation plan. Leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, as well as cadres of various functional departments, went deep into workshops and teams to mobilize the masses to find ways to solve problems existing in production. At the same time, indicator charts were used to check the completion of the plan on a daily basis. In March, each workshop has achieved an average of twenty-five days of daily plan fulfillment, and the open-hearth workshop has been able to complete its production plan on a daily basis since mid-March.

    In order to further strengthen plan management, the plant decided to mobilize the masses to discuss and revise various quotas in April and May, and to rectify the original records, so as to make the operation plan more complete.

    天津钢厂按月均衡生产
    第一季度生产计划超额完成
    天津钢厂超额完成了第一季度生产任务，做到了按月完成计划。三月份，各车间平均有二十五天按日完成了计划。
    该厂一九五三年的生产、财务、技术计划，都比去年增产节约计划高。如钢锭产量提高了百分之十四点一四；钢材提高了百分之五点五八。质量上要求在第二季达到新颁布的全国钢铁标准。计划虽然比去年提高了很多，但在该厂全体职工的努力下，一、二、三月份都超额完成了。总计第一季度钢锭产量完成计划百分之一百零一点四四；钢条产量：小型轧钢车间完成了百分之一百零三点六五，中型轧钢车间完成了百分之一百三十四点一二；镀锌铁丝完成了百分之一百零二点八八。在质量方面，钢锭合格率超过计划百分之点九二；二十五糎元钢合格率超过计划百分之点六六，十糎元钢超过百分之点一。一月份降低成本计划全部完成，二、三月份主要原材料消耗定额都比计划降低了。
    该厂所以能按月完成并超额完成生产计划，主要是采取了以下几项措施：
    一、贯彻苏联专家建议，推广先进经验，认真采纳群众提出的合理化建议。如平炉冶炼学习了苏联快速炼钢法，出现了杨锡恩操作法，产量质量都有提高；镀锌车间推广了萧长清工作法，提高了质量；拉丝车间推广了张俊荣创造的双模三斗操作法，提高产量将近一倍；轧钢车间执行苏联专家建议，钢锭烧损率由六十多公斤降到三十多公斤。
    二、加强安全工作，减少了事故。过去该厂不认真执行定期检修制度，机器有了毛病总是“凑合着用”，等到出了事故，便手忙脚乱，浪费更多的时间去修理，以致不能按作业计划进行均衡生产。今年一月份，他们解决了炼锰铁的电炉通风、盘条车间轧钢机的安全罩子等安全生产上的重大问题。二月份又抓紧了机器设备的检修工作，解决了几十件检修问题，减少了机器临时发生的故障，提高了作业效能，二月份工伤事故比一月份减少四起，一、二、三等分厂全月未发生事故。三月份又开展保安大检查，认真解决检查出来的问题，对保证均衡生产起了很大作用。
    三、领导干部深入车间小组，加强了按作业计划进行均衡生产的领导。一月份，在党总支领导下，纠正了会议多、研究生产时间少的缺点。二月开始强调按作业计划进行均衡生产，党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部和各职能科的干部深入车间小组，发动群众设法解决生产中存在的问题。同时采用了指示图表，按日检查完成计划的情况。三月份各车间已做到了平均有二十五天按日完成计划，平炉车间自三月份中旬已能逐日完成生产计划。
    为了进一步加强计划管理，该厂决定在四、五月份内发动群众讨论与修订各项定额，整顿原始记录，把作业计划制订得更加完备。
