Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 11th: On April 7th, the US side murdered a prisoner of war at POW camp number 6 in Nonsan. According to the US side, the prisoner of war was killed by a stone moved by a road roller while being forced to do hard labor. The US side has not released information about those prisoners of war detained on the Korean peninsula for a long time, those prisoners of war who the US side stubbornly claims "refuse repatriation." The incident at the Nonsan POW camp shows that the US side is forcing prisoners of war to engage in dangerous labor that violates the Geneva Convention, thereby torturing their will to demand repatriation.

    美方又谋害战俘一名
    【新华社开城十一日电】四月七日，美方在论山第六号战俘营谋害战俘一名。据美方宣布，这名战俘是在被迫做苦工时被一块由压路机移动起的石头砸死的。美方已经很久没有透露关于那些被拘留在朝鲜大陆上的战俘的消息，这些战俘是被美方硬说是“拒绝遣返”的。从论山战俘营的事件可以看出，美方正在强迫战俘从事违反日内瓦公约的危险的劳动，藉此来折磨他们要求遣返的意志。
