    On the Battlefront of National Economic Construction
    Prospecting for Mineral Deposits in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia
    The seven geological prospecting teams of the Northeast Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government set off in early April for the provinces of Rehe, Songjiang, and Jilin, as well as the Greater Khingan Mountains and the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to search for non-ferrous metals, ferrous metal deposits, and coalfields.
    Among these seven teams, three are comprehensive teams that include all aspects of prospecting work, equipped with surveying, drilling, and trenching capabilities; three are general survey teams; and one is a mass reporting investigation team organized to strengthen the investigation of mass mineral reports. This team, based on reports from the masses, departed four times between mid-March and early April to conduct investigations, which proved that the reports from the masses were all non-ferrous metals with exploration value.

    Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company Creates Brick Grinding Machine
    The main task of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company is to build various industrial furnaces, and the materials used are mainly refractory bricks, supplemented by other bricks. The quality requirements are also very strict, so most of the bricks used in furnaces must be processed before they can be used. However, in the past, Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company always used manual labor to process refractory bricks, and in each project, the processing man-hours of bricks accounted for a large proportion of the total man-hours of the project. Therefore, the leadership called on everyone to create a brick grinding machine to solve this problem. All employees studied it with confidence several times, but failed. Later, with the help of Soviet experts and the active support of the leadership, engineer Qu Shutang and several technical workers actively researched, and in early March, they reorganized their forces and further studied the properties of refractory bricks. During the research, it was found that general metal knives were not suitable for grinding bricks. Later, a new proposal from Soviet experts was accepted, and Comrade Gong Xichun took the initiative to find a way to make knives from cemented carbide steel, clamp them on the knife wheel, and use a lathe for testing. This time, it could rotate 400 revolutions per minute, grinding 100 square centimeters of brick in 17 seconds, with a grinding depth of 5 mm. The efficiency and quality were very good. Recently, under the proposal of Soviet experts, Li Yongsheng, Zhao Guofu, Gong Xichun, and engineer Qu Shutang successfully reformed the test with a large gear. This brick grinding machine can grind 200 No. 4 refractory bricks every day, and the speed and quality have also been significantly improved, which has made a great contribution to high-chemical engineering.

    Exchange of National Foundry Work Experience
    The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the Preparatory Committee of the China Machine Manufacturing Trade Union jointly convened a national foundry professional conference from March 15th to 21st to summarize and exchange the experience of foundry work in machine manufacturing factories over the past few years.
    In recent years, machine factories in various parts of our country have created and accumulated many valuable experiences and advanced working methods in foundry work. However, the handicraft management methods of foundry workshops have not been thoroughly reformed, and many advanced experiences have not been promoted. There are still serious problems such as many defective products and low quality in the foundry departments. According to statistics from 41 factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the total weight of defective products in 1952 reached more than 10,000 tons; many castings did not meet the quality standards.
    After full discussion, the conference affirmed that in terms of modeling, the leaky mold modeling method should be vigorously promoted in the future to guide the backward handicraft modeling gradually towards mechanization. In terms of labor organization, the "stage division of labor system" should be implemented to realize labor division specialization and improve the utilization rate of production area and equipment. In terms of technical management, the experience of the foundry workshops of Northeast Machine Factory No. 6 and Jinan Machine Factory No. 2 should be promoted, quality standards and technical conditions should be formulated, a regular defective product analysis system should be established, the dedicated control system of molding sand and iron smelting should be promoted, and the casting process card system should be gradually implemented to establish and improve the process regulations.
    The conference held many thematic reports and physical exhibitions, and organized representatives to visit the Beijing Machine Factory to watch the performance of the leaky mold modeling method.
    Ningxia Builds Salt Transport Highway in the Desert
    The People's Government of Ningxia Province recently built a highway spanning 300 li in the desert of Alxa League Mongolian Autonomous Region, which solved the difficult problem of transporting salt from Jilantai Salt Lake to other places. This highway starts from Shizuishan on the bank of the Yellow River in the east and ends at Jilantai Salt Lake at the foot of Bayan Ula Mountain in the west.
    Jilantai Salt Lake is the largest of the fourteen natural crystalline salt lakes in the Alxa League Mongolian Autonomous Region. The salt lake is about 160 li around, and there is a salt layer as deep as five feet in the lake, with large, white, and extremely high quality crystals that are readily available. However, since the salt lake is located in the desert, surrounded by continuous large sand dunes, there are many difficulties in transportation. In order to help the region overcome the difficulties, the People's Government of Ningxia Province began to build this highway in November last year. During the construction process, thanks to the active help of the Mongolian, Hui, and Han people, the highway was quickly opened to traffic. Now dozens of cars run on this highway every day, transporting the natural crystal salt from Jilantai Salt Lake to various places.

    Large-scale Sand Prevention and Afforestation Movement Unfolds in Northwest China
    Along the 3,000-li sand prevention line in the northwest region, from Yulin County, Shaanxi Province in the east to Jiuquan County, Gansu Province along the Great Wall, a large-scale sand prevention and afforestation movement has been fully launched, with a plan to afforest more than 200,000 mu this year.
    The seventeen afforestation farms, afforestation stations, and local people's governments on the sand prevention line mobilized more than 300,000 farmers as early as late March to transport more than 20 million saplings to the afforestation area. The Zhongwei Sand Prevention Forest Farm in Ningxia Province and the party and government leaders of the county led 15,000 farmers, carrying dry food, to go deep into the sandy nests 50 li for afforestation; by early April, they had completed the task of afforesting 5,020 mu this spring. The Xue Wanxiang Joint Sand Prevention and Afforestation Group in Minqin County, Gansu Province, carried out public-private cooperative afforestation on 560 mu of public land in Zhangjiatan Henan Lake in the county, ensuring a survival rate of 85 percent.

        Pingxiang Mining Area Accelerates the Construction of Miners' City
    A brand-new miners' city is being accelerated in the Pingxiang mining area. In the past barren valleys, the newly built employee residences are now linked together. These residences can provide a very comfortable living environment for the miners and their families. New hospitals, sanatoriums, health canteens, bathrooms, cooperatives, cinemas, radio stations, newspapers, schools for children of employees, and other buildings are distributed in the middle of these residential areas. Soon, a large number of pumping equipment will be installed here to draw clean river water from more than ten miles away outside the mining area for the use of the miners' city. The construction of solarium rooms to protect the health of miners is also being actively prepared.
    With the gradual completion of new residences, miners, especially labor models and new record creators, have successively moved into new homes. The construction of this miners' city began in 1950, with a preliminary plan of 100,000 square meters of housing area, which will be completed in 1954. By the end of last year, more than 40,000 square meters of project had been completed. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Chongqing Builds Workers' Sanatorium
    The Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions decided to allocate 4 billion yuan to build a workers' sanatorium in Beibei Hot Springs. The sanatorium covers a total area of ​​2,800 square meters. In addition to a two-story brick and wood structure sanatorium room, there are also auxiliary houses such as a auditorium, club, dining room, kitchen, shower room, and toilet. Most of the interior equipment is designed according to advanced Soviet experience. A group of workers can be admitted to the hospital for recuperation this summer.
    Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine Installs Sun Lamps in Deep Pit
    The Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine has installed ten sun lamps for workers working in deep pits. The buildings for installing sun lamps have now been completed, including a sun lamp room, shower room, drying room, and dressing room. These sun lamps are scheduled to start shining on International Labor Day on May 1st. The deep pit is the only underground operation part of the open-pit coal mine, lacking sunlight. With sun lamps, workers working in deep pits can avoid suffering from rheumatism. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    勘测东北和内蒙古的矿藏
    中央人民政府地质部东北地质局的七个地质勘探队，于四月上旬出发到热河、松江、吉林各省和兴安岭山脉及内蒙古自治区东部地带，要找寻有色金属、黑色金属矿藏和煤田。
    这七个队里，有三个是包括各项探矿工作的，配备有测量、钻探、坑探力量的综合队；有三个是普查队；有一个是为了加强群众报矿的调查工作而组织的群众报矿调查队，这个队在三月中到四月初，根据群众的报告就出发了四次，进行调查，证明群众所报告的都是有勘探价值的有色金属。

    鞍钢筑炉公司创造磨砖机
    鞍钢筑炉公司的主要任务是修建各种工业用炉，使用的材料主要是以耐火砖为主，其他各种砖为辅。质量要求也很严格，因此，大部分炉所用的砖，必须经过加工才能使用。但过去鞍山筑炉公司对耐火砖的加工一向是用人力来做，在每个工程中，砖的加工工数在整个工程工数中都占很大比例。于是领导上号召大家要创造磨砖机来解决这个问题。全体职工满怀信心的研究过几次，都失败了。以后在苏联专家帮助和领导上的积极支持下，曲树堂工程师和几个技术工人积极钻研，在三月初旬又重新组织了力量，进一步的研究耐火砖的性质。在研究中发现一般金属刀不适于磨砖。以后又接受了苏联专家新提议，由宫锡纯同志主动想办法，用硬质合金钢做成刀，卡在刀轮上，用车床代替试验，这回一分钟能转四百转，十七秒能磨砖一百平方糎，磨砖深五粍，效率与质量都很好。最近李永盛、赵国福、宫锡纯和曲树堂工程师在苏联专家提议下，又用大牙轮加以改造试验成功。这个磨砖机每天可以磨二百块四号耐火砖，速度和质量也显著的提高了，这对高化工程有很大贡献。（刘忠宽）交流全国翻砂工作经验
    第一机械工业部和中国机器制造业工会筹备委员会在三月十五日到二十一日联合召开了全国性的翻砂专业会议，总结和交流几年来机器制造工厂中翻砂工作的经验。
    我国各地机器工厂中的翻砂工作，几年来创造和积累了许多宝贵经验和先进工作法。但是翻砂工场的手工业管理方法一直没有得到彻底改革，许多先进经验未能推广，翻砂部门还存在着废品多、质量低等严重情况。据第一机械工业部所属四十一个厂的统计，一九五二年的废品总重量达到一万吨以上；很多铸品达不到质量标准。
    这次会议经过充分讨论，肯定了在造型方面，今后应大力推广漏模造型法，以便引导落后的手工业造型逐步走向机械化。在劳动组织方面，要推行“阶段分工制”，实行劳动分工专业化，提高生产面积和设备的利用率。在技术管理方面，应推广东北机器六厂和济南机器二厂翻砂车间的经验，制订质量标准和技术条件，建立经常性的废品分析制度，推行型砂和化铁的专责控制制度，逐步贯彻铸造工艺卡片制度，建立并健全工艺规程。
    会议举行了很多专题报告和实物展览，并组织到会代表到北京机器厂参观了漏模造型法的表演。
    宁夏在沙漠中修建运盐公路
    宁夏省人民政府最近在阿拉善旗蒙族自治区的沙漠中修筑了一条长达三百华里的公路，使吉兰泰盐湖的盐向外地运输的困难问题得到了解决。这条公路东起黄河沿岸石咀山，西至巴音乌拉山下的吉兰泰盐湖。
    吉兰泰盐湖是阿拉善旗蒙族自治区的十四个天然结晶盐湖中最大的一个。盐湖周围约一百六十华里，湖内有深达五尺的盐层，颗大色白、质量极高、随捞随生。但由于盐湖位于沙漠之中，周围有连绵不断的大沙山，所以在运输方面就有许多困难。宁夏省人民政府为了帮助该区克服困难，从去年十一月间起便开始修筑这条公路。在修筑过程中，由于得到蒙、回、汉各族人民的积极帮助，这条公路很快就通车了。现在每天有数十辆汽车在这条公路上奔驰，把吉兰泰盐湖的天然晶盐运往各地。

    西北展开大规模防沙造林运动
    西北区东自陕西省榆林县西到甘肃省酒泉县长城沿线三千里的防沙线上，大规模的防沙造林运动已全面展开，计划今年共造林二十万亩以上。
    防沙线上的十七个造林场、造林站和当地人民政府，早在三月下旬就动员了三十多万农民，把两千多万株树苗运抵造林地带。宁夏省中卫防沙林场和该县党政领导干部，带领一万五千农民，带着干粮，深入沙窝五十里造林；到四月上旬，他们已完成今年春季造林五千零二十亩的任务。甘肃省民勤县薛万祥联合防沙造林组，在该县张家滩河南湖五百六十亩公地上，进行公私合作造林，保证成活率达百分之八十五。（新华社）
        萍乡矿区加速建设矿工城
    一座崭新的矿工城正在萍乡矿区加速建设着。在过去荒凉的山谷中，现在新建的职工住宅已经是一片联着一片。这些住宅可供矿工们和他们的眷属们很舒适地居住。新的医院、疗养院、保健食堂、浴室、合作社、电影院、广播电台、报社、职工子弟学校等等建筑物，分布在这些住宅区的中间。不久，这里还要安装大批抽水设备，以便从矿区外面十多里远的地方把清洁的河水抽进来，供矿工城使用。为保护矿工身体健康的太阳灯室的建筑，也在积极筹备。
    随着新住宅的逐步落成，矿工们首先是劳动模范和新纪录创造者们，已经陆续地迁入新居。这座矿工城从一九五○年开始修建，初步计划房屋面积为十万平方公尺，将在一九五四年完成，去年年底已有四万平方公尺以上的工程完工。（新华社）
    重庆修建工人疗养院
    重庆市总工会决定拨款四十亿元，在北温泉修建工人疗养院一所。疗养院总共占地面积两千八百平方公尺，除有两楼一底、砖木结构的疗养室一幢外，还有礼堂、俱乐部、饭厅、厨房、淋浴室、厕所等附属房屋。室内设备多系根据苏联的先进经验设计的。今年夏天即可接受一批工人入院休养。
    抚顺露天煤矿深部坑装设太阳灯
    抚顺露天煤矿已为深部坑工作的工人装设了十台太阳灯。现在安装太阳灯的建筑物已经修建完成，其中有太阳灯室、淋浴室、干燥室、更衣室等。这些太阳灯预定在“五一”国际劳动节开始照射。深部坑是露天煤矿仅有的井下作业部分，缺乏阳光。有了太阳灯以后，可以使深部坑工作的工人避免患风湿症。（新华社）
