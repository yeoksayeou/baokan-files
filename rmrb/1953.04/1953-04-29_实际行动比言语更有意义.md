Actions Speak Louder Than Words

American President Eisenhower delivered a foreign policy speech on April 16th. Public opinion in various countries around the world believes that President Eisenhower's speech was a response to the Soviet government's recent statement regarding the possibility of peacefully resolving outstanding international issues. Regarding President Eisenhower's speech, the Soviet "Pravda" published an important editorial on April 25th. The "Pravda" editorial, with well-known and vivid facts, pointed out the two different foreign policies adopted by the Soviet Union and the United States in recent years on major international issues, and clearly expressed the Soviet side's willingness to conduct serious and pragmatic discussions on specific issues through direct negotiations and, if necessary, within the framework of the United Nations. The "Pravda" editorial convincingly proves that the Soviet Union's practical efforts to seek peaceful solutions to various international issues have been consistent and sincere. This editorial from "Pravda" is yet another and further manifestation of the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy. It is entirely natural that this editorial quickly received a clear and positive response in world public opinion. We, the Chinese people, express our complete sympathy and support for the Soviet "Pravda" editorial.

The "Pravda" editorial said, "Actions speak louder than words," which is the truth demonstrated by all things. The editorial pointed out that Eisenhower's words, "We seek a true and comprehensive peace throughout Asia, as throughout the world," and "No issue, large or small, is incapable of resolution, provided there is a willingness to respect the rights of all nations," have received a good response. However, the "Pravda" editorial also had to point out: "President Eisenhower's opinions on the issue of peace, as well as his words that no outstanding issues are incapable of resolution, are contradictory to other opinions in the same speech." The editorial listed facts manifested in various international issues, proving that the five "principles" that Eisenhower mentioned in his speech to determine American foreign policy were merely empty rhetoric that has not been confirmed by action. Whether on the Korean issue, the German issue, the issue of China, or other issues, the United States has rarely considered these "principles" in the past and present. In his speech, Eisenhower wanted people to believe that the policies of the US-British bloc were somewhat peaceful in nature and shifted the responsibility for their expansion of armaments onto the Soviet Union. This is completely untrue. The Soviet Union is tirelessly engaged in postwar reconstruction and developing the national peaceful economy, while firmly opposing the expansion of armaments. Countless indisputable facts prove that the Soviet Union is the main pillar of maintaining and consolidating world peace. Eisenhower's speech not only showed that he would continue to implement the unpopular "Marshall Plan" and "Truman's Point Four Program" with the "World Assistance Fund," emphasizing the importance of "the North Atlantic Organization, including the European Defense Community," but also openly raised the threat of the possibility of "atomic war." Obviously, the US government's foreign policy and President Eisenhower's peace rhetoric are far apart. Thus, it is difficult to determine what the true foreign policy of the United States currently is.

Now, we should quote President Eisenhower's own words, which are: "The test of truth is simple; only action is convincing." Currently, the focus of world public opinion is the Korean issue. People should first demand that both negotiating parties use practical actions to confirm their sincerity in wanting to achieve a Korean armistice and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. As the Soviet "Pravda" editorial pointed out, "In recent years, these issues have been a test of the foreign policies of many countries." The Soviet government has always advocated and supported the efforts of the Chinese and Korean peoples to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Recently, the proposals put forward by China and North Korea to resolve the issue of all prisoners of war to facilitate a Korean armistice immediately received the support of the Soviet Union. According to this proposal, at the meeting of delegations of both sides of the armistice negotiations resumed in Panmunjom on April 26, our chief representative, General Nam Il, further put forward our specific implementation plan for resolving the repatriation issue of all prisoners of war as the basis for consultation and discussion at the meeting of delegations of both sides. This plan made clear concessions to the US side in terms of steps, time, and method. Our current implementation plan specifically stipulates that the repatriation of prisoners of war should be carried out in two steps. The first step should be to repatriate all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation within two months after the armistice agreement takes effect, in batches, according to Article 3, Paragraph 51 of the armistice agreement and based on the final list exchanged and corrected by both sides, directly to the party to which the prisoners of war belong, without any hindrance. The second step should be to send a portion of our captured personnel who, under the intimidation and oppression of the US side, are apprehensive and dare not return home, to a neutral country agreed upon by both parties within one month after the direct repatriation of all captured personnel who insist on repatriation is completed, and release them from the military control of the US side to be received and taken care of by this neutral country; Within a six-month period from the date these prisoners of war arrive in the neutral country, our side will conduct full explanations to dispel their fears; During this period, all prisoners of war who request repatriation should be assisted to return to their homeland immediately, and if there are still prisoners of war under the care of the neutral country after the expiration of the period, they will be handed over to the higher-level political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement for consultation and resolution. Our specific implementation plan is obviously our further and most reasonable specific action to seek a Korean armistice. Everyone can see that, for this plan aimed at resolving the differences between the two sides on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation and seeking an armistice, the United States should only carefully consider it to seek a compromise, and should not, as they have shown in the past few days, simply obliterate and deny it. This is an important opportunity to seek peace with concrete actions, and this is the real test that the US government cannot avoid.

As the Soviet "Pravda" editorial pointed out, President Eisenhower did not mention the issue of China in his speech, which is a fact that universally feels surprising. According to the five "principles" announced by Eisenhower as the US government's foreign policy, there is a principle that "any country has the right to establish a government and economic system according to its own will, and this right is inalienable"; "It is unreasonable for any country to forcibly order other countries to accept its own form of government." However, contrary to these "principles," in the US President's State of the Union address this year on February 2, he openly announced that he would use the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan to harass the Chinese mainland. US Secretary of State Dulles even more brazenly openly supported the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan and praised the US government's blockade and embargo against our country. The American foreign policy promoted by this current US Secretary of State is obviously completely contrary to the "principles" and "seeking a true and comprehensive peace throughout Asia..." calls stated in the speech by the current US President Eisenhower. It is no wonder that former British Labour government minister Strachey believed that the characteristic of Dulles's speech was the intention to turn Eisenhower's speech into "an act of war."

The "Pravda" editorial emphasized: "Soviet leaders have never made any preconditions when calling on the United States and other countries (whether they are dependent on the US-British bloc or not) to peacefully resolve international issues." However, Eisenhower put on a posture in his speech and put forward many demands, as if there could be no peace in the world unless other countries satisfied the US government according to these demands. As for whether other countries also have demands worthy of consideration by the United States, the US President simply ignored them. This attitude is not only not beneficial to "seeking a true and comprehensive peace," but will also be very harmful. The US government cannot achieve peace with coercive conditions with an attitude of dominating the world. The attitude that should be taken to seek peace is, of course, the attitude of the Soviet leaders pointed out in the "Pravda" editorial: "Welcome any step taken by the US government or the government of any other country, as long as it is a step aimed at amicably resolving outstanding issues."

Now, all peace-loving people around the world have obtained a key to understanding international issues from the Soviet "Pravda" editorial. People can also thoroughly recognize the unwavering nature of the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy from this editorial. As Comrade Malenkov said at the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet Union's peace policy is based on respecting the rights of the people of other countries, large and small, and abiding by recognized international norms; the Soviet Union's foreign policy is based on strictly and unswervingly abiding by all treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with other countries. Now, there is no dispute or outstanding issue that cannot be peacefully resolved on the basis of mutual agreement between the countries concerned. This refers to our relations with all countries, including the United States." This clear peace foreign policy of the Soviet government has received increasingly broad sympathy and support from the public in various countries around the world. This peace foreign policy has once again become a powerful support and encouragement for the people of all countries who demand negotiated solutions to international disputes and outstanding issues, and for all countries willing to coexist peacefully. There is no doubt that the Chinese people wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's peace policy and will promote the cause of world peace and international friendly cooperation with the unity of the two countries. Currently, China and North Korea are continuing to make persistent efforts to promote a Korean armistice and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. We deeply understand that our efforts will be of great benefit to promoting peace and security in the Far East and the world. Our efforts are fully in line with the interests of the Chinese and Korean peoples, as well as the people of all countries whose sons and daughters are fighting in Korea, and the interests of countries willing to end the Korean War. Therefore, our efforts will surely receive all just assistance and support.

    实际行动比言语更有意义
    美国总统艾森豪威尔四月十六日发表了外交政策演说。世界各国的舆论认为，艾森豪威尔总统的这一篇演说，是对苏联政府最近发表的关于和平解决悬而未决的国际问题的可能性的声明的答复。对于艾森豪威尔总统的这个演说，苏联“真理报”在四月二十五日发表了重要的社论。“真理报”的社论以众所周知的生动事实，指出了最近几年来在主要国际问题上苏联和美国所采取的两种不同的外交政策，并明白表示苏联方面愿意通过直接谈判，并且在必要时在联合国范围内对特定问题进行认真的实事求是的讨论。“真理报”这个社论令人信服地证明苏联为谋求和平解决各项国际问题所作的实际努力是一贯的真诚的。“真理报”的这篇社论也正是苏联一贯的和平外交政策的又一次的和进一步的表现。这篇社论迅速地在世界舆论中获得了明显的良好反响是极其当然的。我们中国人民对于苏联“真理报”的社论表示完全的同情和支持。
    “真理报”社论说：“实际行动比言语更有意义”，这是一切事物所表现的真理。社论指出，艾森豪威尔所说的“我们在整个亚洲正如在整个世界一样，寻求一个真正的全面的和平”，“只要有尊重一切国家权利的意愿，这些问题不问大小没有一个是不可以解决的”这些话，已经得到良好反应。但是，
    “真理报”的社论同时不得不指出：“艾森豪威尔总统关于和平问题发表的意见以及他所说的没有任何悬而未决的问题不可以解决的话，是与他在同一演说中的其他意见互相矛盾的。”社论列举在各项国际问题中所表现的事实，证明艾森豪威尔在演说中所说的决定美国外交政策的五个“原则”，只是空泛的论调，这些论调没有得到行动的证实。不论是在朝鲜问题上、在德国问题上、在关于中国问题上以及其他问题上，美国过去和现在都很少考虑到他们的这些“原则”。艾森豪威尔在他的演说中，想要人们相信美英集团的政策是多少带有和平的性质的，并把他们进行扩张军备的责任推到苏联身上。这是完全不合事实的。苏联不懈地从事战后恢复工作和发展国民和平经济，而坚决反对扩张军备。无数不容争辩的事实，证明了苏联是维护和巩固世界和平的主要支柱。艾森豪威尔的演说不仅显示他将以“世界援助基金”来继续执行那不受欢迎的“马歇尔计划”和“杜鲁门第四点计划”，强调“包容欧洲防御集团在内的北大西洋组织”的重要性，并且公然提出“原子战争”的可能性的威胁。显然，美国政府的外交政策和艾森豪威尔总统的和平论调是相差很远的。这样，就很难使人断定美国目前真正的外交政策究竟是什么了。
    现在正应该引用艾森豪威尔总统自己所说的话，这就是：“对于真理的考验很简单，只有行动才有说服力。”目前世界舆论关注的中心就是朝鲜问题。人们首先应该要求谈判双方用实际行动来证实它愿意实现朝鲜停战及和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。正如苏联“真理报”社论所指出的，“最近几年来，这些问题是许多国家外交政策的考验”。苏联政府一向倡导和支持中、朝两国人民争取和平解决朝鲜问题的努力。最近中朝两国为解决全部战俘问题以促成朝鲜停战而提出的建议，立即得到了苏联的支持。根据这个建议，在板门店四月二十六日恢复举行的停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日大将进一步提出了我方关于解决全部战俘遣返问题的具体实施方案，作为双方代表团大会协商讨论的基础。这个方案在步骤、时间和方法上，对美方作了显明的让步。我方现在的这个实施方案，具体规定对战俘的遣返工作分做两个步骤来进行。第一个步骤，应把一切坚持遣返的战俘，在停战协定生效后的两个月内，依照停战协定第三条第五十一款的规定，并根据双方所交换和校正过的最后名单分批遣返，直接交给战俘所属的一方，不得加以任何阻难。第二个步骤，应把一部分在美方恐吓和压迫下心存疑惧，不敢回家的我方被俘人员，在一切坚持遣返的被俘人员的直接遣返完成之后的一个月以内，由美方负责送到一个经双方协商同意的中立国家去，并从美方的军事控制下释放出来，由这个中立国加以接收和看管；在这些战俘到达中立国之日起的六个月期限内，经过我方进行充分解释，使他们解除疑惧；在这期间，凡要求遣返回家的一切战俘，应即协助其返回祖国，期满后如尚有在中立国看管之下的战俘，便交由停战协定所规定的高一级的政治会议去协商解决。我方这个具体实施方案，显然就是我方为了谋取朝鲜停战的进一步最合理的具体行动。人人都可以看到，对于这个旨在解决双方在战俘遣返问题上的分歧、谋取停战的方案，美国方面只应该加以仔细考虑来寻求妥协，而不应该如他们过去几天所表现的，一味加以抹煞和否定。这就是以具体行动来谋取和平的重要时机，这就是美国政府所不能回避的真正考验。
    正如苏联“真理报”社论所指出的，艾森豪威尔总统在他的演说中没有谈到中国问题，这是普遍令人感觉惊奇的事实。按照艾森豪威尔所宣布的美国政府外交上的五个“原则”中就有这样的原则：“任何国家都有按照自己的意愿来建立政府和经济制度的权利，这种权利是不容剥夺的”；“任何国家如果要想把自己的政府形式强行命令其他国家接受，都是没有道理的”。但是，和这些“原则”相反，在今年二月二日美国总统的国情咨文中还公然宣布要利用台湾国民党残匪窜扰中国大陆。美国国务卿杜勒斯，更加没有顾忌地公开支持台湾国民党残匪，并赞扬美国政府对我国进行的封锁和禁运。这位美国现任国务卿所宣扬的美国外交政策，和美国现任总统艾森豪威尔演说中所说的“原则”及“在整个亚洲……寻求一个真正的全面的和平”的呼吁，显然是完全背道而驰的。这就无怪乎前英国工党政府大臣斯特拉彻认为杜勒斯的演说的特点，是意图把艾森豪威尔的演说变成“战争的行动”。
    “真理报”社论着重指出：“苏联领袖从来没有在向美国和其他国家（不论它们是不是依附于美英集团的）呼吁和平解决国际问题时，还提出什么要求做先决条件。”可是艾森豪威尔在演说中却摆出一种姿态提出了许多要求，似乎别国如果不按照这些要求来满足美国政府，世界上就不能有和平。至于别国是否也有值得美国加以考虑的要求美国总统却根本不加理会。这种态度不仅对于“寻求一个真正的全面的和平”没有好处，而且会有很大害处。美国政府不可能以独霸世界的态度用强制条件来取得和平，应当有的谋取和平的态度当然就是“真理报”社论所指出的苏联领袖的态度：“欢迎美国政府或其他任何国家的政府的任何步骤，只要这是旨在友好地解决悬而未决的问题的步骤。”
    现在全世界一切爱好和平的人们都从苏联“真理报”的社论获得了洞察国际问题的一把钥匙。人们更可以从这篇社论中透彻地认识了苏联所一贯坚持的和平政策的不可动摇性。正如马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议上的发言中所说的：“苏联的和平政策是以尊重其他大小国家的人民的权利，遵守公认的国际准则为基础的；苏联的外交政策是以严格地、坚定不移地遵守苏联与其他国家所缔结的一切条约为基础的。现在，没有任何纠纷或悬案不能在有关各国互相协议的基础上和平解决。这是指我们和一切国家的关系，包括美国在内。”苏联政府这个鲜明的和平外交政策，得到了世界各国公众越来越广泛的同情和支持。这个和平外交政策在今天又一次成了对于要求协商解决国际纠纷和悬案的各国人民和一切愿意和平共处的国家的有力的支持和鼓励。毫无疑问，中国人民衷心地拥护苏联的和平政策，并将以两国的团结一致来促进世界和平及国际友好合作的事业。目前中朝两国正继续为促成朝鲜停战及和平解决朝鲜问题而坚持努力。我们深切地了解，我们这个努力对于促进远东及世界和平与安全将有极大裨益。我们的这个努力对于中朝两国人民以及凡有儿女在朝鲜作战的各国人民和愿意结束朝鲜战争的国家的利益是完全符合的。因而，我们的这个努力一定会得到一切正义的援助和支持。
