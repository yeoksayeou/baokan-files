The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government issued a notice to the People's Procuratorates in all regions, urging them to strictly prevent murders and violations of law and discipline during the Marriage Law implementation movement. The notice pointed out: Generally, good results have been achieved in the key pilot projects for the Marriage Law implementation movement in various regions, and many experiences have been created. Under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, the People's Procuratorates at all levels have also actively and proactively participated in this movement, providing favorable conditions for carrying out the movement on a large scale. However, in a few regions, due to cadres' insufficient understanding of the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions and their failure to clarify the purpose, nature, principles, and specific methods of the movement, deaths and violations of law and discipline have occurred. According to telephone reports from seven counties in the Zhengzhou Special District of Henan alone, from February 22nd to March 9th of this year, there were 21 consecutive death incidents (6 men, 15 women), including 12 suicides, 2 murders, 6 rescues, and 1 missing person.

The notice pointed out that the main reasons for these serious phenomena are twofold. First, as women's awareness increased and they actively strived for marital freedom, they suffered retaliation and murder from opponents. For example, Li Xiuying, a woman from Heilongtan Township, Yuwangmiao District, Gong County, Henan, had poor feelings for her husband and had gone to the township four times, the district twice, and the county People's Court twice to request a divorce, but it was not resolved, and the relationship between husband and wife deteriorated further. After the Marriage Law implementation movement began, her husband, Niu Fengchi, killed Li Xiuying with a knife on the evening of March 5th. Second, some grassroots cadres did not understand the policies, engaged in chaotic propaganda, randomly sought out typical cases, and recklessly pursued past events, causing panic among the masses and leading to murders. For example, Ji Li from Shili Pu Township, Qiqu District, Chenggao County, Henan, committed suicide by hanging herself because she had committed adultery and the township cadres and militiamen proposed to investigate her, fearing that she would become a typical case. Similar situations have also occurred in Hunan, Hebei, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other places.

In order to prevent the recurrence of the above incidents, the notice requires People's Procuratorates at all levels to pay close attention to feudal criminal activities in the Marriage Law implementation movement and to treat the inspection and prosecution of such criminal acts as the focus of their work, taking serious and effective measures to investigate and deal with them. For phenomena that cause panic among the masses due to errors in work and simple and crude working methods, they should also be quickly corrected. Suicide incidents caused by violations of law and discipline by cadres should be handled responsibly to educate cadres and the masses. People's Procuratorates at all levels must pay close attention to every murder that occurs in the movement, cooperate with relevant departments to investigate and study, analyze the causes, determine responsibilities, make thorough handling, and study prevention measures to ensure the correct and healthy development of the movement.

The notice pointed out that individual regions have also seriously violated the central government's policies in handling marriage cases and should pay attention to correcting them. For example, marriage tribunals have been established in all districts of Leping County, Jiangxi Province. The county leading organs decided to punish 60 people in the Marriage Law implementation movement throughout the county and stipulated that those sentenced to imprisonment of less than five years need not ask the county for instructions. Thirty-seven people have already been sentenced, many of whom should not have been sentenced. For example, a farmer in the county was sentenced to one and a half years in prison by the district marriage tribunal for beating his wife. His wife took the children and ran more than 70 miles, crying and asking the court to release her husband. Another example is that the cadres of the county's marriage tribunal believed that the death of a landlord's old wife's daughter-in-law due to difficult childbirth before liberation should be the responsibility of the mother-in-law (she did not pay attention when her daughter-in-law was giving birth), so they sentenced the mother-in-law to three years in prison, leaving the five-year-old child unattended. The masses were terrified when they saw this situation. The notice pointed out that these are all violations of law and discipline. If People's Procuratorates at all levels discover similar situations, they should immediately pay attention to correcting them and cooperate with the local People's Courts to review and handle them again. Those who should not be sentenced should immediately request the revocation of the original sentence.

The notice stipulates that People's Procuratorates at all levels should promptly report the above-mentioned situations to higher levels for instructions.

    最高人民检察署通报各地人民检察署严密防范贯彻婚姻法运动中发生命案
    中央人民政府最高人民检察署通报各地人民检察署，严密防范贯彻婚姻法运动中发生命案和违法乱纪的事件。通报指出：各地在开展贯彻婚姻法运动的重点试验过程中，一般都已取得良好成绩，并创造了许多经验。各级人民检察署在当地党、政机关领导下，也积极主动地参加了这一运动，为大规模开展运动提供了有利条件。但有少数地区，由于干部对中央指示的精神领会不够，对运动的目的、性质、方针和具体作法没有弄清，因而在运动中也发生死人的现象和违法乱纪事件。仅据河南郑州专区七个县的电话报告统计，从本年二月二十二日到三月九日的半个月当中，就连续发生死人事件二十一起（男六、女十五），其中自杀已死的十二人，被杀已死的二人，经救活的六人，逃亡失踪的一人。
    通报指出：造成这些严重现象的原因主要有二。一、是由于妇女觉悟提高，积极起来争取婚姻自由，遭受反对者的报复，杀害。如河南巩县玉皇庙区黑龙坛乡妇女李秀英，因与丈夫感情恶劣，曾四次到乡、两次到区、两次到县人民法院要求离婚，都未得到解决，夫妻感情更为恶化。贯彻婚姻法运动开始后，其夫牛凤池于三月五日晚间用刀将李秀英杀死。二、有些基层干部不明了政策，乱宣传，乱找典型，乱追往事，引起群众恐惧，造成命案。如河南成皋县七区十里铺乡季李氏因曾和人通奸，乡干部和民兵提出要查，她怕当典型，即上吊自杀。类似情况，在湖南、河北、上海、广东、浙江等地也陆续发生。
    为了防止上述事件继续发生，通报要求各级人民检察署在贯彻婚姻法运动中，对封建性的犯罪活动，应严密注意，并以检察此类犯罪行为作为工作重点，采取严肃而有效的办法进行查处。对于因工作上的错误和工作方式简单粗暴而引起群众恐慌的现象，也应迅速纠正。其中因干部违法乱纪而引起的自杀事件，更应认真负责处理，以教育干部和群众。各级人民检察署对于运动中所发生的每一命案，必须引起高度注意，并配合有关部门调查研究，分析原因，查明责任，作彻底的处理，并研究防止办法，保证运动正确地、健康地开展。
    通报指出：还有个别地区在处理婚姻案件中严重违反中央政策，也应注意纠正。如江西省乐平县各区都成立了婚姻法庭。县领导机关决定在贯彻婚姻法运动中全县要惩办六十人，并规定判处徒刑五年以下者不必向县请示。现已判处了三十七人，其中很多人是不应该判刑的。如该县有个农民因打老婆被区婚姻法庭判了一年半徒刑，他老婆带着孩子跑了七十多里路哭哭啼啼跑到法院，请求释放她丈夫。又如该县有个地主老婆子的儿媳在解放前因难产死去，该县婚姻法庭的干部认为这个儿媳的死应由婆婆负责（儿媳生产时她不注意），因此判了这个婆婆三年徒刑，丢下五岁的小孩无人照顾。群众看到这种情况，都恐惧不安。通报指出：这些都是违法乱纪的行为。各级人民检察署如发现类似情况，应立即注意纠正，并协同当地人民法院重新审查处理，不该判刑的应立即提请撤销原判。
    通报规定各级人民检察署对上述各种情况应及时逐级请示报告。
