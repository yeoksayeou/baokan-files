Workers in Japan, India, France, Belgium and Other Countries Actively Launch Struggles to Win Living Rights and Defend Peace

Japanese "Sohyo" Decides Future Struggle Direction

The Japan General Council of Trade Unions (Sohyo), the largest labor organization in Japan with approximately three million members, held a meeting in Tokyo on the 11th, attended by 60 representatives and more than 10 economists, to discuss the prospects of the Korean armistice negotiations and its relationship with the Japanese labor movement.

At the end of the meeting, Sohyo Secretary-General Minoru Takano announced that Sohyo would launch the following struggles: 1. Oppose all conquest and colonial provisions under the US Far East policy; 2. Oppose militaristic and fascist governments and defend basic human rights; 3. Launch a people's movement to demand the completion of the Korean armistice negotiations; 4. Convene a peace economy conference attended by representatives from various industry unions, economic and technical experts; 5. Oppose capitalist "industrial rationalization" measures that would cut wages and strengthen workers' struggles to improve people's living standards.

Japanese Steel, Railway and Other Workers Strike

The strike movement of the Japanese working class demanding wage increases is continuing across the country, with more and more trade unions participating in the strike.

100,000 workers from 30 steel companies, including Yawata Iron & Steel Co., Fuji Iron & Steel Co., and Nippon Kokan Co., affiliated with the Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions, simultaneously held a 24-hour strike on the 7th, demanding wage increases. According to Kyodo News, the strike by steel workers reduced the production of blast furnaces by 30 percent. 17,000 workers from 16 unions affiliated with the Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions held another strike on the 14th as planned, demanding wage increases. The strike brought production to a standstill at Kobe Steel, Nisshin Steel and Tokuyama Teppan, among others.

Workers at three major steel factories, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Fuji Iron & Steel, and Nippon Kokan, have decided to strike on the 17th.

Prior to this, many Japanese trade unions held a series of strikes demanding wage increases. On April 3, many trade unions belonging to the General Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions of Japan held strikes. In Osaka alone, workers from ten private railway companies and bus companies participated in the strike. On the same day, 23,500 workers working at the Nichihoku factory in Ibaraki Prefecture also held a strike demanding wage increases. In addition, members of the National Federation of Bank Employees' Unions in Oita Prefecture, Kyushu, also held a strike on the 6th to demand wage increases.

Indian Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress Holds Annual Meeting

The annual meeting of the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress of India was held on March 21 and 22. The annual meeting showed the growing strength of the working class in West Bengal.

The annual meeting was attended by 605 delegates and 900 guests. The annual meeting representatives represented 205 member unions with 165,000 members. Members include more than 36,000 railway workers, about 11,000 other transport workers, 27,000 jute workers, 25,000 engineering workers, 5,000 tea garden workers and about 8,000 textile workers.

Satyapriya Banerjee, chairman of the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress, reviewed the development of the Indian trade union movement at the meeting and called on workers to unite against the US conspiracy to drag the world into another war, and actively participate in the struggle for peace and against imperialism.

The annual meeting protested against the US government's death sentence on the Rosenbergs and demanded that the French government release Alain Le Léap, vice chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The annual meeting passed resolutions on basic demands, trade union unity, and democratic rights and civil liberties. The annual meeting elected Satyapriya Banerjee as chairman of the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress and Ranan Sen as general secretary.

Workers Across France Continue to Strike

The French working people continue to struggle to improve their living conditions and defend democratic rights and freedoms.

After the Paris subway workers went on strike on the 10th, Paris bus drivers and conductors went on strike for 24 hours on the 12th. The resolution of the strike committee stated: "Bus conductors and drivers are determined to defend their right to strike and freedom. They will continue to fight until all demands are met and until the trade union leaders arrested for defending the interests of the working class are released."

Members of the right-wing Socialist Party's trade union "Workers' Force," the "French Confederation of Christian Workers," and grassroots organizations of various "independent" trade unions participated in the strike, regardless of the divisive activities of their upper-level leaders.

Electricity and gas workers, civil servants, and employees of hotels, cafes, and restaurants held short-term strikes.

The strike movement is continuing to develop in various provinces. Tram workers in Marseille held their third 24-hour strike on the 12th, demanding wage increases and reinstatement of dismissed workers.

Belgian Workers Fight Back Against the Offensive of Monopoly Capital

The Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Bobrovsky on the struggle of the Belgian working people for their rights.

The author pointed out that the arms race and the cessation of normal trade relations with countries of the democratic camp have aggravated Belgium's economic difficulties. The woodworking, textile, clothing, footwear, food and other peaceful industries are constantly collapsing. Workers in the metal industry and machine manufacturing industry are also constantly being laid off. Currently, 26 railway lines have ceased operations. According to clearly scaled-down official figures, the number of unemployed at the beginning of this year has reached 380,000. Due to rising prices, the cost of living in Belgium has increased fourfold compared to pre-war levels.

But economic militarization has brought huge profits to Belgium's monopoly capital. In the past two to three years, the profits of Belgium's largest metallurgical and coal companies have doubled.

Belgian monopoly capitalists have intensified their offensive against the vital interests of the working people. Rents soared in January this year. At the beginning of this year, the Belgian government decided to cut back on the already meager social insurance allocations, which deprived many disabled and sick workers in industrial and government departments of their benefits. Factory owners are implementing speed-up systems. Due to the lack of safety equipment, the accident rate is soaring.

The author then wrote that the Belgian working people are intensifying their fight back against the offensive of large monopoly capital. In recent months, there have been many major strikes. Tram workers in Antwerp held an 18-day strike, and the major strike at the La Bruscha machine factory continued for more than two months. The striking workers achieved victory. Despite the sabotage of splitters in the labor movement, the actions of the Belgian working people are becoming more and more consistent, and their unity is becoming stronger and stronger.

### 日本、印度、法国、比利时等国工人阶级积极展开争取生活权利和保卫和平的斗争

    日本、印度、法国、比利时等国工人阶级积极展开争取生活权利和保卫和平的斗争
    日本“总评”决定今后斗争方针
    拥有会员约三百万人的日本最大的劳工组织——日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）的六十名代表和十多名经济学家，于十一日在东京举行会议，讨论朝鲜停战谈判的前途和它与日本工人运动的关系。
    会议结束时，“总评”事务局局长高野实宣布，“总评”将展开下列的各种斗争：一、反对美国远东政策下的一切征服性和殖民化的规定；二、反对军国主义化和法西斯化的政府，保卫人类的基本权利；三、发动人民运动，要求完成朝鲜停战谈判；四、召开一个由各业工会、经济和技术专家代表们参加的和平经济会议；五、反对会使工资削减的资本主义式的“工业合理化”措施，加强工人为提高人民生活水平而进行的斗争。
    日本钢铁、铁道等业工人罢工
    日本工人阶级要求增加工资的罢工运动正在全国各地继续进行，参加这一罢工的工会越来越增多。
    属于日本钢铁产业工会联合会的八幡制铁公司、富士制铁公司、日本钢管公司等三十家钢铁公司的十万名工人在七日同时举行了二十四小时的罢工，要求提高工资。据共同社估计：这次钢铁工人的罢工使高炉的生产量减低百分之三十。日本钢铁产业工会联合会所属的十六个工会的一万七千名工人已按照预定计划在十四日再次举行罢工，要求增加工资。罢工使神户制钢所、日亚制钢公司和德山铁板公司等的生产陷于停顿。
    住友金属工业公司、富士制铁公司和日本钢管公司这三个大钢铁工厂的工人已经决定在十七日举行罢工。
    在此以前，日本许多工会为了要求增加工资举行了一连串的罢工。四月三日，属于日本私营铁道工会总联合会的许多工会都举行了罢工，仅仅大阪一地，就有十家私营铁道公司和公共汽车公司的工人参加罢工。同日，在茨城县日玄工厂中工作的两万三千五百名工人也举行了罢工，要求增加工资。此外，九州大分县全国银行从业员工会联合会的会员为了要求提高工资也在六日举行了罢工。
    印度孟加拉省总工会举行年会
    印度孟加拉省总工会年会在三月二十一日和二十二日举行。年会显示了西孟加拉省工人阶级日益增涨的力量。
    参加年会的有六百零五个代表和九百个来宾。年会代表拥有会员十六万五千人的二百零五个会员工会。会员中包括三万六千以上铁路工人、约一万一千其他运输业工人、二万七千黄麻业工人、二万五千工程业工人、五千茶园工人和约八千纺织工人。
    孟加拉省总工会主席萨蒂亚普里亚·班纳吉在会上回顾了印度工会运动的发展以后，号召工人们团结起来反对美国把世界拖进另一次战争的阴谋，积极参加争取和平和反对帝国主义的斗争。
    年会抗议美国政府判处罗森堡夫妇死刑，并要求法国政府释放世界工会联合会副主席阿兰·勒里普。
    年会通过了基本要求、工会团结以及民主权利和公民自由等决议。年会选出萨蒂亚普里亚·班纳吉为孟加拉省总工会主席，拉南·塞恩为总书记。
    法国各地工人不断举行罢工
    法国劳动人民继续进行斗争，争取改善生活条件和保卫民主权利和自由。
    巴黎地下电车工人在十日举行了罢工以后，巴黎公共汽车司机和售票员又在十二日罢工二十四小时。罢工委员会的决议说：“公共汽车售票员和司机决定保卫他们的罢工权利和自由。他们要继续斗争，直到全部要求得到满足，直到为保卫工人阶级的利益而被捕的工会领袖获得释放。”
    右翼社会党的工会“工人力量”、“法国天主教劳工联盟”和各种“独立”工会基层组织的会员不顾他们上层领导者的分裂活动，参加了这次罢工。
    电力和煤气工人，公务员，旅馆、咖啡店和饭店的雇员，都举行了短时间罢工。
    各省的罢工运动也在继续发展。马赛电车工人在十二日举行第三次的二十四小时罢工，要求增加工资，复用被解雇工人。
    比利时工人反击垄断资本的进攻
    苏联“真理报”发表波布罗夫斯基撰写的关于比利时劳动人民为他们的权利而斗争的文章。
    作者指出，扩充军备运动和停止与民主阵营国家的正常贸易关系已加重了比利时的经济困难。木工、纺织、服装、靴鞋、食品等业以及其他和平工业正不断倒闭。金属工业和机器制造工业的工人也正在不断被解雇。目前已有二十六条铁路线停止运行。根据显然缩小了的官方数字，今年年初的失业人数已达三十八万。由于物价不断上涨，比利时的生活费用已增加为战前的四倍。
    但是经济军事化却给比利时的垄断资本带来了巨大的利润。在过去两年到三年中间，比利时最大的冶金和煤公司的利润即增加了一倍。
    比利时的垄断资本家加紧了进攻劳动人民的切身利益。今年一月房租猛涨。今年年初，比利时政府又决定削减本来已很微少的社会保险拨款，这就剥夺了许多工业和机关部门中残废和患病工作者的福利。工厂主正在实行赶快制度。由于缺乏安全设备，事故率正在激增。
    作者接着写道，比利时的劳动人民正加紧反击大垄断资本的进攻。最近几个月来发生了多次大罢工，安特卫普电车工人举行了十八天的罢工，拉布吕舒阿机器工厂的大罢工继续了两个月以上，罢工工人们获得了胜利。尽管分裂分子在劳工运动中进行阴谋活动，比利时劳动人民的行动却越来越趋于一致，他们的团结也越来越加强了。
