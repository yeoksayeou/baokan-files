Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Tokyo News: According to the U.S. plan to turn Japan into a military base, the Japanese Yoshida government is preparing to build a military expressway from Tokyo to Kobe – the so-called "cannonball highway" – at a huge expense.

The highway will be 527 kilometers long, 22 meters wide, and completely paved with cement. The total cost of the project will be 114.5 billion yen. After the completion of the project, military vehicles will travel at a speed of more than 100 kilometers per hour, and the entire journey can be completed in five hours.

The Yoshida government has decided to advance the start date of the first phase of construction of this highway from 1954 to 1953. The highway to be built in the first phase will start from Tokyo, pass through Kawasaki, Yokohama, Atsugi, Matsuda, and finally reach Gotemba at the foot of Mount Fuji, with a total length of 77.3 kilometers. This section of the highway connects the U.S. military base in Tokyo, the Tana ammunition depot (Yokohama), the Zama barracks, the Atsugi Airport, and the Gotemba training base.

The construction of this military highway will disrupt the lives of residents in the project area. It is estimated that the construction of the highway will requisition more than 1,700 chobu of land (1 chobu equals 99 acres), of which 44 percent is paddy fields and 22 percent is dry land. Local residents have expressed their firm opposition to the construction of the military highway from the beginning. Farmers in Yokohama, Kawasaki, Ogone and other places have held two meetings to decide to vigorously launch a campaign against the construction of the military highway, and demanded that prefectural, city councilors, and Diet members of local origin should also come forward to carry out the opposition movement. People in Yamauchi, Nakazato, and Tana in Kanagawa Prefecture have launched a petition campaign against the construction of the "cannonball highway" and formally established the "Alliance to Resolutely Oppose the Construction of the Cannonball Highway." The signatures of more than 8,700 people have been submitted to the Diet by Diet members such as Kihachiro Kimura of the Labor-Farmer Party.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Tokyo News: U.S. Ambassador to Japan Murphy and Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, Mikine Ogasawara, continued to hold a series of meetings to discuss the expansion of Japan's military industrial production.

In the second meeting held on March 26, Murphy guaranteed that the United States would "return" the Japanese armories it had taken over and other Japanese military equipment currently used by the U.S. military as soon as possible. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry admitted that "after Japan recovers these facilities, it will give Japan's military industry the tonic it needs."

During the talks, the Japanese side requested that the United States quickly formulate a long-term plan to order weapons and munitions from Japan, and lease to Japan special machines needed to produce various weapons. In order to enable the United States to understand and grasp the situation of Japan's military production, Japan submitted a list of Japanese weapons manufacturers to the United States during the talks. The list included the names of factories manufacturing artillery, torpedoes, rocket launchers, aircraft, bullets, shells and bombs.

At present, the main driving force for promoting Japanese military production is the U.S. "special procurement" orders. According to statistics from the Japan Economic Deliberation Agency, since the outbreak of the Korean War, U.S. "special procurement" orders to Japan have reached US$1,001,663,000. The total amount of "special procurement" orders in the 1952 fiscal year (April 1952 to March 1953) was US$390 million, an increase of US$35 million over the 1951 fiscal year. In March 1953, "special procurement" orders increased to US$89,141,000, creating the highest record for monthly orders.

### 日本横滨、川崎等地人民  反对修建美军用公路  美日反动派策划扩充日本军火工业

    反对修建美军用公路
    美日反动派策划扩充日本军火工业
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：根据美国使日本军事基地化的计划，日本吉田政府正准备以大量的经费建筑从东京到神户的军用快速公路——所谓“炮弹公路”。
    这条公路的全长是五百二十七公里，宽度是二十二公尺，路面全部以水泥铺筑，全部工程费用达一千一百四十五亿日元。工程完成以后，军用汽车将以每小时一百多公里的速度行驶，五小时可跑完全部路程。
    吉田政府已决定把修建这条公路第一期工程开工日期从一九五四年提前到一九五三年。第一期工程所修筑的公路，是从东京起，经过川崎、横滨、厚木、松田，最后到达富士山麓的御殿场，全长七十七点三公里。这段公路贯连着东京的美军基地、田奈火药库（横滨）、座间兵营、厚木飞机场、御殿场演习基地等。
    这条军用公路的修建，将破坏工程区的居民的生活。据估计，修建公路将征用土地一千七百多町步（一町步等于九十九公亩），其中有百分之四十四是水田，有百分之二十二是旱田。当地居民自始就表示坚决反对修建军用公路。横滨、川崎、大根等地的农民曾经两次召开会议，决定大力展开反对修建军用公路运动，并要求原籍本地的县、市议会议员和国会议员一道起来进行反对运动。神奈川县的山内、中里、田奈各地的人民发起了反对修建“炮弹公路”的签名请愿运动，并且正式成立了“坚决反对修建炮弹公路同盟”。八千七百多人的签名已由劳农党的木村禧八郎等国会议员送交国会。
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：美国驻日大使墨菲和日本通商产业相小笠原三九郎继续举行一连串的会议，讨论扩大日本的军事工业生产。
    在三月二十六日举行的第二次会谈中，墨菲曾保证美国将早日“归还”它所接收的日本兵工厂和现由美军使用的其他日本各种军事设备。通商产业省方面承认，“日本在收回这些设备后，将使日本的军火工业获得所需的强心剂。”
    在会谈中，日本方面要求美国迅速制订一个向日本订购武器和军火的长期计划，并租借给日本以生产各种武器所需要的特别机器。为了使美国了解和掌握日本军事生产的情况，日本在会谈中将一份日本武器制造商的名单交给了美国，这个名单中开列着包括制造大炮、鱼雷、火箭炮、飞机、子弹、炮弹和炸弹等工厂的名字。
    在目前，促进日本军事生产的主要推动力是美国的“特需”订货。据日本经济审议厅的统计，自从朝鲜战争爆发以来，美国对日本的“特需”订货已达到十亿零一百六十六万三千美元。一九五二会计年度（一九五二年四月到一九五三年三月）“特需”订货的总额是三亿九千万美元，比一九五一会计年度增加了三千五百万美元。一九五三年三月份，“特需”订货曾增加到八千九百一十四万一千美元，造成每月订货款额的最高记录。
