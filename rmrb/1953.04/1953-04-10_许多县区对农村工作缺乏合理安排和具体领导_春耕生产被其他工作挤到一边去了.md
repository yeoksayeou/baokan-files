According to reports from various locations, many leading cadres in counties and districts have not followed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to make spring plowing production the central task that overrides all others in rural areas. They have not made reasonable arrangements for various rural tasks, resulting in spring plowing production being squeezed aside by other work. This urgently needs to be corrected.

    Tangshan Suburban District, Hebei Province

    Saying "Spring Plowing Production Overrides All"
    Doing "Everything Overrides Spring Plowing Production"

    In order to make agricultural production the central task of the suburbs, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tangshan Municipal People's Government successively convened two expanded cadre meetings in February and March. Relevant municipal-level agencies, groups, bureau chiefs of the Municipal People's Government, and district committee secretaries, district chiefs, and rural cadres from various suburbs attended the meetings. At the meetings, everyone's thinking seemed to be "clear." However, a working group composed of the Rural Work Department of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and other units recently inspected various districts and discovered that many cadres still did not put agricultural production first in their actual work. Many cadres verbally emphasized the importance of spring plowing production, but in practice, they could not shift the focus of their work to spring plowing production. In particular, the Tenth District only focused on vigorously promoting the Marriage Law and carrying out sanitation campaigns, thus "overriding" agricultural production. When comrades from the working group asked Wang Shuxun, the district committee secretary, about the progress of spring plowing production work, Wang Shuxun said: "I am participating in Party rectification, so I cannot speak about the production situation." Cadres from the Propaganda Department of the Tenth District Committee only asked about the implementation of the Marriage Law when they went to the countryside, and cadres doing sanitation work only supervised sanitation work. No one asked about agricultural production, and everyone was not integrated with each other. The working group inspected eight villages and asked the village branch secretaries: "What is the central task currently? Which task carries the most weight?" Everyone said: "Production, implementing the Marriage Law, and sanitation campaigns are all central tasks, but implementing the Marriage Law carries the most weight, because we have only received training in implementing the Marriage Law." The blackboards in the villages were all covered with propaganda materials for the Marriage Law, with no mention of spring plowing production.

    Shangqiu Special District, Henan Province

    County and District Cadres are Overwhelmed and Cannot Grasp the Center
    "Blitz Campaigns" Squeeze Out Production and Disaster Relief

    In Shangqiu Special District, Henan Province, there are currently many tasks (spring plowing production, production-based disaster relief, implementing the Marriage Law, suppressing secret societies, digging rivers, collecting land and property ownership certificate fees, patriotic hygiene, etc.), and the tasks are heavy. Some county and district leaders are overwhelmed and cannot grasp the center, either grabbing at everything randomly or each doing their own thing. They have not made reasonable arrangements for the work, resulting in the spring plowing production work, which should override all others, being squeezed out. Some cadres say: Production work is long-term, so we can postpone it and complete the blitz campaigns first! Although some counties and districts have designated "key production townships," no cadres are sent to lead them. Even if there are, they focus on other "blitz campaigns" rather than spring plowing production. More seriously, the production-based disaster relief work in some disaster areas has also been squeezed out by other "blitz campaigns." In Konglou Township, Dancheng County, some farmers could not make ends meet and went to the township government for help. The township cadres could not find a solution and asked the district for help, but the district committee secretary could not find a solution either. Cadres in Yuanzhai Township, Guo Village District, Shangqiu, do not care about production-based disaster relief work. The township government is withholding 600,000 yuan in relief funds. The chairman of the township farmers' association is attending an expanded cadre meeting in the county, and the township head is watching a play at home. When village cadres report the disaster situation to him, he immediately accuses the village cadres of "exaggerating the disaster." Zhangzhuang Village in this township has a total of fifteen livestock, and twelve are currently out of fodder, and ten households are preparing to sell their livestock. This situation is seriously affecting the current spring plowing production work.

    Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province

    "The Top Deploys Work in a Disorganized Manner
     The Cadres Below are Confused and Dazed"

    Various departments in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, are haphazardly deploying work to the villages, preventing township cadres from properly leading spring plowing production. At the meeting of township farmers' association directors in Huazhuang District, Wuxi County, everyone reflected many serious situations. The director of the Luoxia Township Farmers' Association said: The Wuxi County Monopoly Bureau held a village cadre meeting at night without going through the district and township governments, ordered the completion of forms, and set a deadline of the next morning for submission. The comrades from the bureau also said: "We are directly under the leadership of Jiangsu Province and do not need to go through the district and township." The tax office also arbitrarily holds village cadre meetings. Cao Minggui, the director of the Sericulture Guidance Station, also wants the township cadres to notify and convene an enlarged meeting of village cadres without consulting the township cadres. Lu Renfu, the director of the farmers' association, asked him how the meeting would be conducted. He said: "You just notify for me! I have to urgently go to the county for a meeting and will give a report when I return." He also said: "If the work is not done well, you will bear full responsibility." Therefore, rural cadres reflect that "the top deploys work in a disorganized manner, and the cadres below are confused and dazed."

    Departments one-sidedly emphasizing their own work and neglecting that production is the central task that overrides all others in rural areas is a current problem. Zhang Zhenming, the director of the Huazhuang Branch of the People's Bank, is a typical example. When the district notified him to attend a meeting to study production work, he always said he was too busy to attend. If he wanted to deploy banking business, he would carry a small briefcase and ask the district chief and district committee secretary for help. Zhang Jianyue, the director of the district health center, told cadres in Donggang Township: "This time, the county chief has ordered the digging of fly pupae, which should be 30% coercion and 70% mobilization!" When someone asked him if this was true, he couldn't say it. The sericulture instructor, without considering the actual situation below, proposed: "This year, 80% of silkworm rearing should be organized." The township cadres asked them who would lead the organization. The director of the Sericulture Guidance Station said: "We'll talk about it after the organization is established. This is what the higher-ups have ordered." The above situation has caused dissatisfaction among many cadres, who reflect: "The work of various departments above is all pressing down on us, and they (referring to the cadres of departmental work) are not willing to do their central work at all."

    Ling County, Hunan Province

    "Working Group" Members Each Do Their Own Thing
    "Key Production Township" Relaxes Production

    Caoping Township in Ling County, Hunan Province, completed land reform and shifted to winter plowing production in mid-December last year. The county designated this township as a key production township for 1953 and sent a working group to lead production and rectify mutual aid organizations with emphasis. This working group had six cadres: three bank cadres, two cadres from county leading organs, and one cadre from the armed forces department. Their work steps were not unified, and they each did their own thing after going to the countryside. The bank cadres rectified the credit cooperatives, the armed forces department cadres rectified the militia organizations, and the cadres sent by the county leading organs rectified the mutual aid teams. Everyone said that their department's work was important and wanted to complete it as soon as possible. One bank cadre said: "I must complete the work plan for rectifying the credit cooperatives before February 7th, no matter what." The cadres of the armed forces department believed that the rectification of militia organizations was not combined when the township's land reform was completed (actually, it was combined), so now they wanted to specifically take a few days to hold militia meetings. The cadres sent by the county leading organs to lead production did not know how to arrange and combine various tasks. When the cadres of various departments were each doing their own thing, he felt helpless. Therefore, he felt that "each additional professional department comrade adds one more task." A total of five or six cadres, if you want to hold mass meetings to engage in production, he wants to hold militia meetings to rectify the organization, making the township cadres and the masses of farmers dizzy and confused. They were in meetings all day long, sometimes two or three meetings a day. As a result, the more meetings there were, the more the township cadres hated them, the work was sluggish, the problems could not be solved, and the tasks were not completed. Some team leaders disliked the excessive number of meetings and simply put the "emergency notices" and forms issued by the township government in their pockets. When the working cadres urged them, they would say: "I'll beat the gong, and you hold the meeting." The masses were very dissatisfied with "always holding meetings, holding old meetings." Some reflected: "We have meetings every night, and they are still talking about the present, without any effect. It's better to get some sleep." Therefore, some farmers simply didn't attend any meetings.

    Now, inspecting the work of the township, nothing has been done well, especially production has been greatly affected. By mid-February, three dams, six canals, and more than ten ponds in the township had not been repaired. The fertilizer accumulation campaign has not been widely launched either.

    Hu County, Shaanxi Province

    This is Also "Integration," That is Also "Integration"
    But No Specific Methods Were Taught to the Grassroots Cadres

    In many areas of Hu County, Shaanxi Province, leading cadres concentrated their efforts on promoting and implementing the Marriage Law and Party rectification, cadre evaluation, and other work, thus relaxing or abandoning the leadership of spring plowing production work. Some district and township cadres always felt that farmers would produce on their own and did not need leadership, and that promoting and implementing the Marriage Law was a major issue, so they specialized in this. Like the ninth and tenth townships (mountainous areas) in the Second District, the spring famine was relatively serious, and it was difficult to teach the masses to concentrate on production without solving the people's livelihood problems. However, the cadres sent by the higher authorities concentrated non-detached production cadres such as Party members, League members, village cadres, propagandists, and activists in the township and held meetings continuously for nine days. In the morning, they learned the Marriage Law and discussed it. In the afternoon, they learned the Party rectification documents and discussed them in the evening. The rural production was in a state of neglect, which seriously affected spring plowing production work. The township leading organs did not report it, and the district leading organs did not know about it and could not stop it. In addition, some cadres did not distinguish between primary and secondary tasks and wanted to do everything. When deploying work, the cadres of the Fourth District "put down" the tasks of "integrating the Marriage Law with production," "integrating Party rectification with rectifying mutual aid teams," and "integrating rapid literacy with sanitation" without distinguishing between urgency and priority, resulting in nothing being done well. The district committee secretary of the Second District still believed that this approach was "correct" at the reporting meeting. The spring famine in the Second District was also relatively serious, and the district leadership did not specifically focus on trying to organize farmers to produce and save themselves. The leadership did not teach the grassroots cadres how to lead production, and many grassroots cadres did not know how to do it well. Wang Shunxin, the party branch secretary of the fourth township in the third district, could only go to each village after dinner every day and shout: "The higher authorities are calling for production! Let's all go to the fields to produce!"

### 许多县区对农村工作缺乏合理安排和具体领导  春耕生产被其他工作挤到一边去了

    许多县区对农村工作缺乏合理安排和具体领导
    春耕生产被其他工作挤到一边去了
    根据各地来稿反映，许多县区的领导干部，还没有按照中共中央的指示，把春耕生产作为农村中压倒一切的中心任务，对农村各种工作，没有进行合理的安排，结果春耕生产还是被其他工作挤到一边去了，这是急应纠正的。
    河北省唐山市郊区
    说的是“春耕生产压倒一切”
    做的是“一切压倒春耕生产”
    为了把农业生产作为郊区的中心工作，中共河北省唐山市委和唐山市人民政府先后在二、三月间，召开过两次扩大干部会议。市级各有关机关、团体，市人民政府各局局长，各郊区区委书记、区长、农村干部都参加了会议。在会议上，大家的思想似乎都“明确”了。但最近中共唐山市委农村工作部等单位组成的工作组到各区一检查，才发现很多干部在实际工作中仍然没有把农业生产放在第一位。很多干部口头上也讲春耕生产如何如何重要，但实际上总是不能把工作重点扭转到春耕生产上去。特别是第十区，只顾到了大张旗鼓地宣传婚姻法，搞卫生运动，就把农业生产“压倒”了。工作组的同志问区委书记王树勋春耕生产工作做得怎么样，王树勋说：“我参加整党呢，对生产情况说不来。”第十区区委宣传部的干部下乡只问婚姻法贯彻得怎么样，做卫生工作的干部只督促卫生工作，谁也不问农业生产，大家互不结合。工作组检查了八个村，问各村支部书记：“目前什么是中心工作？那个工作占分量最大？”大家都说：“生产、贯彻婚姻法、卫生运动都是中心，贯彻婚姻法占分量最大；因为我们就只是受过贯彻婚姻法的训练。”各村黑板报上都是婚姻法宣传材料，没有提到春耕生产的。
    河南省商邱专区
    县区干部手忙脚乱抓不住中心
    “突击工作”挤掉了生产救灾
    河南省商邱专区目前工作多（春耕生产、生产救灾、贯彻婚姻法、取缔会道门、挖河、收土地房产所有证费、爱国卫生等），任务重，有些县、区的领导干部手脚忙乱，抓不住中心，乱抓一气或各搞一套，没有合理地安排工作，结果把作为压倒一切的春耕生产工作挤掉了。有些干部说：生产工作是长期的，往后丢丢，先把突击工作完成再说！有些县区虽然也安了“生产重点乡”，但没有干部去领导，即使有，也是以搞其他“突击工作”为主，而不是以春耕生产为主。更严重的是有些灾区的生产救灾工作也被其他的“突击工作”挤掉了。郸城孔楼乡有几户农民生活上实在没有办法，找到乡政府，乡干部没有办法，请示区里解决，区委书记也没有办法。商邱郭村区袁寨乡干部不管生产救灾工作，乡政府扣着六十万元救济款不往下放，乡农民协会主席在县里参加扩大干部会，乡长在家里看戏，村干部向他汇报灾情，他一张口就是说村干部是“扩大灾情”。这个乡的张庄村总共十五头牲口，现在就有十二头断草，有十户准备卖牲口。这种情况已经严重地影响了当前的春耕生产工作。
    江苏省无锡县
    “上面布置工作多头多脑
     下面干部做得昏头昏脑”
    江苏省无锡县各业务部门乱到农村布置工作，使乡干部不能好好领导春耕生产。在无锡县华庄区乡农会主任会议上，大家就反映了许多严重的情况。落霞乡农会主任说：无锡县专卖事业分处不通过区乡政府，擅自在晚上召开村干部大会，布置填写表格，并限次日上午填好送齐。该处同志还说：“我们是直属江苏省领导的，用不着通过区乡。”税务所也任意召开村干部会。蚕桑指导所主任曹民贵，也不与乡干部研究，就要乡干部替他通知召开村干部扩大会议。农会主任陆仁福问他会怎样开法？他说：“你替我通知好了！我要紧上县里开会，回来由我做报告。”还说：“工作做不好要你负全部责任。”因此，乡村干部反映说：“上面工作布置多头多脑，下面干部做得昏头昏脑。”
    业务部门片面强调本位工作，忽视生产是当前农村中压倒一切的中心工作。人民银行华庄营业所主任张振明是个典型例子。区里通知他出席研究生产工作的会议，他总说没有空参加。如果要布置银行业务，他就背上一个小皮包，跑去请区长、区委书记帮助。区卫生所主任张剑岳对东港乡干部说：“这次县长布置挖蝇蛹工作，要三分强迫，七分动员！”有人问他这话是不是当真的，又说不出口了。蚕桑指导员不根据下面实际情况，就提出：“今年养蚕要百分之八十组织起来。”乡干部问他们组织后什么人去领导？蚕桑指导所主任说：“组织起来后再说，这是上级布置的。”以上情况，造成许多干部不满，反映说：“上面各部门工作单向我们头上压，他们（指部门工作的干部）中心工作一点也不肯做。”
    湖南省酃县
    “工作组”组员各搞一套
    “生产重点乡”放松生产
    湖南省酃县草坪乡是去年十二月中旬结束土地改革转向冬耕生产的。县里确定这个乡为一九五三年的生产重点乡，并派了工作组去领导生产，有重点地整顿互助组织。这个工作组共有六个干部，银行干部三人、县领导机关干部二人，武装部干部一人。他们的工作步调不统一，下乡后便各搞一套。银行干部整顿信用合作社，武装部干部整顿民兵组织，县领导机关派来的干部整顿互助组。各人全说自己的部门工作重要，都想赶早完成。有个银行干部说：“我在二月七日以前，无论如何也要完成整顿信用合作社的工作计划。”武装部的干部认为该乡土地改革结束时，没有结合整顿民兵组织（实际上结合了整顿民兵组织），现在要专门抽出几天时间开民兵会。县领导机关派来领导生产的干部不知道各种工作如何安排与结合，当各部门干部各搞一套时，他便感到无办法，因此觉得“多来一个专业部门的工作同志，就多加了一项工作任务”。一共五、六个干部，你要开群众会搞生产，他要开民兵会整顿组织，闹得乡村干部和农民群众头昏眼花，整天开会，有时一天就是两、三个会。结果是会议越多，乡村干部越讨厌，工作疲沓，问题解决不了，任务也没有完成。有些组长嫌开会太多，便索性把乡政府发下的“紧急通知”和表格等，放在衣袋里。等工作干部催急了，就说：“要打锣我来打，开会你来开。”群众对“老开会、开老会”很不满意。有的反映说：“天天晚上开会，还不是谈现的，没有一点作用，不如困一觉。”因此，有些农民索性什么会都不参加了。
    现在检查该乡工作，样样都没有做好，特别是生产受到很大的影响。到二月中，全乡还有三座坝、六条圳和十多口塘未修好。积肥运动也没普遍展开。
    陕西省户县
    这也是“结合”，那也是“结合”
    却没教给基层干部具体办法
    陕西省户县很多地区的领导干部都把力量集中到宣传贯彻婚姻法和整党、评干等工作上去了，因此，放松或放弃了领导春耕生产工作。有些区、乡干部总觉得农民自己会生产，用不着领导，而宣传贯彻婚姻法是件大事情，就专搞这个。像二区九、十两乡（山区），春荒较严重，不解决群众生活问题，就很难教群众专心搞生产。但是，上级派来的干部却把党员、团员、村干部和宣传员、积极分子等不脱离生产干部都集中到乡，连续开了九天会。早上学婚姻法，上午讨论；下午学整党文件，晚间讨论，这样日日夜夜地搞下去，农村生产便处于无人过问的状态，严重地影响了春耕生产工作。乡领导机关不汇报，区领导机关不知道，也没法制止。另外有些干部是不分主次，样样工作都想做。四区干部在布置工作时，把“婚姻法结合生产”、“整党结合整顿互助组”、“速成识字结合搞卫生”任务，不分缓急主次地“端”下去了，结果样样都没弄好。二区区委书记在汇报会上，还认为这种作法是“对”的。二区春荒也较严重，区的领导上就没有特别把工作重心放在设法组织农民生产自救上。领导方面没有教给基层干部怎样领导生产，很多基层干部也就不知道怎么办好。三区四乡党支部书记王顺新，只能每天饭后到各村喊：“上级号召生产啦，咱们都下地生产吧！”
