When the Tianjin Railway Bureau formulated its basic construction plan for this year, the affiliated units displayed a severe tendency towards greed, impatience, and departmentalism. They requested the construction of many projects that were not in line with subjective and objective conditions. This forced the Tianjin Railway Bureau to spend a great deal of time reviewing these requests, preventing the rapid finalization of the basic construction plan. This has resulted in a passive situation at every step, with a large number of workers now idled, causing significant waste.

There are many examples of such greed and impatience. For example, the Xinxiang Works Section, without investigating the actual situation of the bridges in its jurisdiction, blindly proposed to demolish and rebuild the bridge abutments and piers of six bridges. They claimed that the brick joints were cracked and the previous construction quality was poor, requiring an expenditure of 724 million yuan, and demanded that it be included in this year's urgent tasks. However, after the Tianjin Railway Bureau sent people to conduct an on-site inspection, it was found that the foundations of the abutments and piers of these six bridges were not moving at all. Although the cement applied to the brick joints had fallen off, it could still be used after simply re-cementing the joints. It took fifty-six days to determine that this project would not be carried out. Another example is at Fengcun Station on the Jinghan Line, which was originally a water replenishment station. In 1949, a 60-ton wooden water tower was built. This year, Fengcun Station was converted into a major water supply station. Without in-depth investigation, the locomotive depot stated that the water supply was insufficient after the conversion to a major water supply station, and that a new 100-ton cement water tower needed to be built, requiring an expenditure of 677 million yuan. After an on-site investigation, it was proved that as long as a spare water pump was added and the water pump was opened regularly to ensure water storage, the original water tower would be sufficient. It also took eighty-one days to determine that this project would not be carried out. Furthermore, the rolling stock department requested the construction of new mechanical fitter workshop buildings in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Gu Ye, and other sections. In fact, although the existing mechanical fitter workshop areas in each section were narrow, they could still be used by simply adjusting the positions of the machinery and reinforcing the roof trusses. Even more serious was the fact that the engineering department proposed that a certain tunnel on the Shitai Line was prone to falling rocks and needed lining. After research by the basic construction department and the planning department, it was believed that as long as maintenance was strengthened, the lining project could be postponed for this year. This was because this project would be carried out under the condition of simultaneous construction and traffic, requiring in-depth investigation and full preparation. However, the engineering department disagreed and was unwilling to go to investigate. The several departments argued back and forth, and it has not yet been decided whether to do it or not.

The slow determination of the basic construction plan has put the design work in a seriously passive situation. In order to rush the construction, the design department had to concentrate on designing toilets, switchman's houses, and garages first, regardless of their importance. The result of designing without prioritizing affected the design work related to improving the transportation capacity of the entire railway, such as the plan to extend the tracks at thirty-one stations on the Jinghan Line, which was delayed by two months, affecting the timely improvement of the Jinghan Line's transportation capacity. At the same time, due to the limited time, errors occurred constantly in the design drawings. For example, in the design of the earthwork project for a station on the Jinpu Line, the architectural drawings were inconsistent with the line drawings, causing construction difficulties.

Due to the inability to produce designs, an average of 2,400 workers have been idled every day from December of last year to the present, wasting more than 3 billion yuan in labor costs alone.

    贪多冒进的思想造成了窝工浪费
    天津铁路局在制订今年的基本建设计划时，由于所属各单位贪多冒进和本位主义的思想很严重，要求修建很多不切合主观和客观条件的工程，使得天津铁路局不得不花费很多时间去审核这些请求，以致基本建设计划不能很快地确定，由此造成步步被动，现在工人已大批窝工，造成了很大的浪费。
    这种贪多冒进的例子很多。譬如新乡工务段，没有勘察所辖区段桥梁的实际情况，即盲目提出要拆除六座桥的桥台和桥墩，重新建造，并且提出理由，说砖缝已裂开，过去修建的质量不好，需用款七亿二千四百万元，要求列入今年的紧急任务中。但是，天津铁路局派人实地勘查结果，这六座桥的桥台和桥墩的基础根本没有动，砖缝上抹的洋灰虽然脱落了，但只要用洋灰勾一勾缝，仍可继续使用。这项工程就拖了五十六天才确定不作。又如京汉线冯村站，原来是补水站，一九四九年曾建筑了一座六十吨的木质水塔。今年冯村站改作主要给水站，机务段没有深入调查，就说改成主要供水站后不够供水，要新建一百吨的洋灰水塔一座，需款六亿七千七百万元。后经实地调查，证明只要添置备用水泵，经常开放水泵，保证储水量，原有水塔已经够用了。这个项目也拖了八十一天才确定不作。再如车辆处要求在天津、石家庄、古冶等段新建机械钳工室厂房，其实各段现有机械钳工室面积虽窄，但只要适当调整一下机械位置，加固屋架，仍可继续使用。更严重的像工务处提出石太线某个隧道常有石块坠落，需要?砌。经基本建设处和计划处研究后，认为只要加强维修，今年可以不作?砌工程。因为这个工程要在一面施工一面通车的情况下进行，需要深入调查充分准备才行。但是工务处不同意，也不愿前去调查，几个处扯来扯去，到现在还没有决定做还是不做。
    由于基本建设计划确定得很慢，使设计工作处于严重的被动境地。为了赶着施工，设计部门只好不分轻重缓急，先集中力量设计厕所、搬道房、汽车库。设计不分主次的结果，便影响了有关全路提高运输力的设计工作，如京汉线三十一个站延长股道的计划推迟了两个月，影响了京汉线运输力的及时提高。同时由于时间仓促，设计图纸不断发生错误。如设计津浦线某站土方工程，建筑图样与线路图样不一致，造成了施工困难。
    由于设计不出来，从去年十二月到现在，平均每天窝工二千四百人，仅工费即浪费三十多亿元。
