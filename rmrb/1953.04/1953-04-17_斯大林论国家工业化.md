Stalin on National Industrialization
Sha Ying

(I) Stalin is the creator of the theory of socialist industrialization

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "The Greatest Friendship" written in mourning for Comrade Stalin, said: "Comrade Stalin comprehensively and epoch-makingly developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and advanced the development of Marxism to a new stage."

Comrade Stalin's theory on national industrialization is a development and concretization of Lenin and Stalin's theory on the possibility of building socialism in one country, and is one of the great contributions to the theory of scientific communism.

When Lenin was alive, he not only made a brilliant scientific analysis of the Soviet economy in the initial stage of the transition period, but also gave important instructions on Soviet industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Long before the eve of the Great October Revolution, Lenin emphasized that Russia must catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries not only politically but also economically and technically, which was a matter of life and death for Russia. In Lenin's works, the importance of establishing a socialist material base by developing industry (especially heavy industry) was repeatedly emphasized. As early as April 1918, Lenin drafted the "Outline of the Plan for Scientific and Technological Work," but this plan could not be realized due to the outbreak of the civil war. Lenin's ideas on developing the Soviet national economy and heavy industry were particularly vividly embodied in the All-Russia Electrification Plan formulated in December 1920. This plan was formulated in accordance with Lenin's instructions and the resolution of the Ninth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party. This plan was to transfer the entire national economy to the technical foundation of modern large-scale production. At that time, Comrade Stalin, in a letter to Lenin, highly praised this plan, considering it to be "a precise outline of a truly unified and truly national economic plan."

After Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin inherited Lenin's legacy and turned Lenin's ideals into a living reality. Comrade Stalin conducted in-depth research on the issue of socialist industrialization, summarized the experience of the struggle for the implementation of the industrialization policy in the Soviet Union, truly completed the theory of socialist industrialization, and scientifically pointed out the path of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. He made systematic and scientific arguments on a series of issues such as the methods, speed, funds, and cadres of socialist industrialization. In fact, Comrade Stalin was the creator, inspirer, and organizer of the industrialization of the Soviet socialist state. The brilliant achievements of Soviet industrialization and the great victory of socialism are closely linked to Stalin's name.

Comrade Stalin's theory on national industrialization has great international significance. It is not only a scientific plan for the Soviet Union to build socialism and communism, but also the construction of European people's democratic countries and our China must follow Stalin's theory of industrialization. It is like a searchlight with boundless light, illuminating our path to socialism and communism.

(II) On the Method of National Industrialization

Why carry out national industrialization? What is the task of industrialization? In his speech at the graduation ceremony of students of the Red Army Academy held in the Kremlin in May 1935, Comrade Stalin recalled the path that the Soviet Union had traveled: "As everyone knows, what we inherited from the old era was a technologically backward country, almost destitute, a bankrupt country. It was destroyed by both the four-year imperialist war and the three-year civil war, where few residents were literate, technology was backward, and industry was like individual islands submerged in the vast ocean of countless tiny farms—this is the country that the old era bequeathed to us..."

Before the revolution, Russia's industrial production level was far behind other capitalist countries. In 1913, Tsarist Russia accounted for 2.6 percent of the world's industrial output, while the United States accounted for 38.2 percent and Britain for 12.1 percent. In 1913, the industrial products produced by Russia, calculated per capita, were equal to two-ninths of Britain and two-sevenths of France. The proportion of industry in the entire national economy also accounted for only 42.1 percent. When the period of restoration of the Soviet national economy ended, the Soviet people, after more than four years of hard struggle, healed the wounds brought to the economy by the war in a short period of time, and both industry and agriculture quickly recovered and approached the pre-war level. By 1925, the production volume of Soviet large-scale industry had accounted for about three-quarters of the pre-war output, and agriculture had reached 87 percent of the pre-war level. For this reason, in his report to the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in December 1925, Comrade Stalin said that although the Soviet economy had recovered rapidly at that time, it should not be complacent about this, because the Soviet Union was still a backward agricultural country. At that time, agricultural products accounted for two-thirds of the total output, while industry accounted for only one-third. Therefore, the struggle for socialist national industrialization and the struggle for socialist victory became the basic link in Soviet socialist construction at that time. Comrade Stalin instructed at that time: "To transform our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country that can produce the necessary equipment independently—this is the essence and foundation of our general line." ("Conclusion on the Discussion of the Summary Report on Central Political Work at the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)")

To fight for national industrialization is not merely to develop various industries, but mainly to develop heavy industry, especially the core of heavy industry, namely the machine-building industry. Comrade Stalin emphasized the importance of developing heavy industry in many works, and consistently advocated that the production of means of production should take priority. For example, in his article "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy," he wrote: "Some comrades think that industrialization is generally the development of various industries... Of course, this is incorrect. Not any development of industry counts as industrialization. The center and foundation of industrialization lies in the development of heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and ultimately, in the development of the production of means of production, in the development of the domestic machine-building industry."

Why emphasize the development of large-scale industry (especially heavy industry)? Comrade Stalin profoundly expounded the role of large-scale industry as the economic foundation of socialism. This role lies in: First, large-scale industry itself concentrates all the achievements of science and technology, ensuring that socialist society has a higher level of productive forces than capitalist society. Second, large-scale industry is the foundation of the dictatorship of the working class. The development of large-scale industry means an increase in the number of the working class, meaning an increase in the proportion of the working class in society, thereby consolidating the dictatorship of the working class and strengthening the leadership of the working class over the millions of working people. Third, the development of large-scale industry can manufacture a large number of tractors, combine harvesters, and modern agricultural machinery for the purpose of transforming agriculture and putting agriculture on the socialist road. Fourth, large-scale industry can produce the means of production necessary for the technical transformation of all sectors of the national economy, ensuring the economic and political independence of the country. Fifth, large-scale industry can produce a large number of modern new weapons to ensure the consolidation of national defense and the growth of military economic strength. Sixth, on the basis of the strong development of large-scale industry, the task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries economically can be solved.

For these reasons, it is necessary to first ensure the development of heavy industry and to establish a strong machine-building industry. Comrade Stalin believed that this is the main link of industrialization, the basic key to transforming all sectors of the national economy, the only way for a socialist country to obtain economic and political independence, and at the same time, it is fully in line with the long-term and fundamental interests of the Soviet people. In his last work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin repeatedly pointed out that in the process of national industrialization, the production of means of production must be given priority. He said: "The growth of the production of means of production must take priority not only because this production should ensure the equipment needed by its own enterprises and the enterprises of all other sectors of the national economy, but also because without this production, expanded reproduction is simply impossible."

In order to achieve this arduous task of economic construction in the shortest possible time, the Soviet Union naturally could not adopt the method of capitalist industrialization, but had to adopt the method of socialist industrialization discovered by Comrade Stalin. In his speech at the meeting of voters in the Stalin constituency of Moscow in February 1946, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Soviet method of national industrialization is fundamentally different from the method of capitalist industrialization. The industrialization of capitalist countries usually starts from light industry. Because light industry requires less investment than heavy industry, capital turns over faster, and profits are easier to obtain, light industry there has become the primary target of industrialization. Only after a long period of time, after light industry has accumulated some profits and concentrated them in banks, will it gradually begin to transfer the accumulated capital to heavy industry. The method of industrialization adopted by the Soviet Union is the opposite, starting with the development of heavy industry to implement national industrialization. Although this is an extremely difficult task, this difficulty can be overcome.

It can be seen that the priority development of the production of means of production (heavy industry), and the planned development of the production of means of subsistence on the basis of the development of the production of means of production, is the general policy and general line of the industrialization of the Soviet socialist state.

(III) On the Speed of National Industrialization

The issue of the speed of industrialization occupies a very important position in Comrade Stalin's theory on industrialization. In his works from 1926 to 1931, Comrade Stalin repeatedly emphasized that the national industrialization of the Soviet Union must be carried out at an extraordinary speed, at a "truly Bolshevik speed," so as to quickly catch up with and surpass capitalist countries.

In his speech at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1928 entitled "On National Industrialization and the Right Deviation within the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," Comrade Stalin said: "The rapid development of industry in general, especially the production of means of production, is the basis of national industrialization, that is, the key to transforming our entire national economy on the basis of socialist development. But what exactly is the rapid development of industry? This means investing more in industry. But this requires us to tighten all our plans, whether budgetary or extra-budgetary." Why should all plans be so "tightened"? Comrade Stalin said that this was not due to the "fickle nature" of the members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the People's Committee, but because the domestic and international environment of the Soviet Union at that time made it impossible for the Soviet Union to develop industry at a relatively slow speed. Comrade Stalin analyzed in detail the domestic and international environment of the Soviet Union at that time, pointing out that the Soviet Union had seized power in a country with very backward technology, and that the Soviet Union was the only country with the proletarian dictatorship surrounded by capitalism. In order to catch up with and surpass advanced capitalist countries economically, the Soviet Union had to develop industry at a very fast speed. At the same time, the agricultural technology and culture of the Soviet Union at that time were very backward, and small-scale commodity production was scattered and fragmented, and socialist large-scale industry was still "an island in the sea." Therefore, in order to accelerate and promote the transformation of the rural economy on a new technical basis, the speed of industrial development must also be accelerated.

In this regard, Comrade Stalin also said in his article "On the Tasks of Economic Workers" in 1931: "People sometimes ask: Can't we slow down a little and delay the speed of progress? No, we can't, comrades! We must never slow down! On the contrary, we must try our best and increase the speed as much as possible. Our obligations to the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union require us to do so. Our obligations to the working class of the world require us to do so."

Because the Soviet Union correctly implemented Stalin's instructions and implemented a policy of accelerating industrial development, the party seemed to be spurring the country, so the speed of industrial development in the Soviet Union was rapid. The production volume of Soviet large-scale industry increased by 150.6 percent from 1925 to 1929, while the capitalist countries increased by only 19 percent during the same period. By 1951, the industrial output of the Soviet Union was 1,266 percent of that of 1929, that is, it increased almost twelve times during this period. The industrial production of the United States increased only doubled from 1951 to 1929.

Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report to the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) that the reason why the large-scale industry of the Soviet Union developed so fast was: First, because it is a state-owned industry, it can avoid the obstacles of capitalists' pursuit of private interests and develop according to the interests of the entire society. Second, it is the largest and most concentrated industry in the world. Third, because state-owned transportation, credit, foreign trade, and general budget are all completely in the hands of the state, the state can plan and lead state-owned industry to make it a unified industrial economy. Fourth, because state-owned industry is the largest and most powerful industry, it can implement a policy of constantly reducing costs and prices of goods to expand sales markets and increase the capacity of the domestic market; it develops in the environment of unity between cities and villages, workers and peasants, and creates a source of continuous expansion of production for itself. Fifth, because state-owned industry relies on the working class, it is easy to improve technology and productivity, and it is easy to implement the rationalization of production and management. The above points are clear and ironclad evidence of the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

Comrade Stalin also pointed out that the speed of industrial development must be correctly grasped, neither conservative nor rash. In his article "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy" in 1926, he said:

"Our industrial plan must not be formulated according to bureaucratic fiction, but must be closely linked to the situation of our national economy and to the accurate accounting of our resources and reserves. We must not lag behind the development of industry in the plan of industrial construction. But we must not run forward, deviate from our agriculture, and disregard the speed of our accumulation."

In order to illustrate that grasping the speed of industrial development must be based on specific circumstances, we can also find strong arguments in Comrade Stalin's "Summary of the First Five-Year Plan." He pointed out that as a result of the successful completion of the first five-year plan, the foundation of modern technology has been created in industry, transportation, and agriculture, the defense capabilities have been raised to the due height, and the Soviet Union has built many large factories and joint factories with new and complex technologies, "Precisely because of this, I think we must adopt a slower rate of growth in industrial output during the second five-year plan period." ("Summary of the First Five-Year Plan") More time should be used for workers and engineers and technicians to familiarize themselves with new factories and new technologies, conscientiously improve labor productivity, and conscientiously reduce costs. To ensure that when the second half of the second five-year plan begins, a new rapid run is implemented in terms of both construction and the growth of industrial production.

(IV) On the Funds for National Industrialization

In order to realize national industrialization, to establish heavy industry and to thoroughly transform the entire national economy on the latest basis, a huge amount of funds is needed. Therefore, the issue of capital accumulation is one of the important issues of industrialization.

In addition to the ruthless exploitation of their own workers and peasants, the inflow of foreign capital plays a significant role in the industrialization of capitalist countries. In summarizing the historical experience of the development of capitalist countries, Comrade Stalin pointed out three methods of capital accumulation in capitalist countries: relying on plundering colonies (such as Britain), relying on military reparations (such as Germany), and relying on enslaving loans and concessions (such as Tsarist Russia). However, for the socialist country of the Soviet Union, these methods of accumulating funds could not be adopted. Comrade Stalin studied this issue using scientific methods and found the source of funds within the Soviet Union.

This source of funds is: The Soviet state took all factories, all land, as well as transportation, banks, foreign trade, and domestic commerce seized by the October Socialist Revolution from capitalists and landlords, and placed them under its own control. Now the profits obtained from state-owned factories, transportation, commerce, and banks are no longer used to supply the parasitic class of capitalists for consumption, but are used to continue to expand industry. The Soviet regime canceled the foreign debt borrowed by the Tsarist government. In the past, the people had to pay hundreds of millions of gold rubles every year just to pay the interest on this foreign debt. By eliminating the land ownership of the landlords, the Soviet regime exempted the peasants from paying rent of about 500 million gold rubles to the landlords every year. Because the peasants were freed from all these burdens, they were able to help the country create a new and powerful industry. (See "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," page 346) All these sources of income are in the hands of the Soviet state. These sources can provide huge amounts of funds for the construction of heavy industry.

However, the above is only the possibility of accumulating funds. In order to turn this possibility into reality, Comrade Stalin pointed out that it is necessary to grasp several key points of economic life: First, concentrate the surplus accumulated domestically in credit institutions, do not allow it to be wasted, and issue domestic public bonds, first using them for the needs of industry; second, carefully block all loopholes, and do not allow a part of the surplus accumulated domestically to flow into the pockets of private capitalists; third, within the industry, save some reserves for repairing enterprises and expanding enterprises; fourth, the state should accumulate some reserves to guard against unexpected events (such as crop failures, etc.) and to cultivate industry, support agriculture, and develop culture.

In his speech entitled "New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction" in June 1931, Comrade Stalin pointed out that in addition to strengthening the old sources of accumulation, the Soviet Union has found a new source of accumulation, that is, to implement and consolidate the economic accounting system and increase accumulation within the industry. He said: "We can no longer rely solely on light industry, solely on budgetary accumulation, solely on income from agriculture... What else? There is also heavy industry. Therefore, we must find ways to enable heavy industry—especially the machine-building industry—to also produce accumulation." For this reason,
"It is necessary to eliminate waste, make full use of the resources within the industry, implement and consolidate the economic accounting system in all our enterprises, systematically reduce cost fees, and strengthen the accumulation within the industry in all industrial sectors without exception."

However, accumulating funds is only one aspect of the matter, and the other aspect is to properly use our funds. In his article "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy" in April 1926, Comrade Stalin said:

"But the matter is not limited to and cannot be limited to accumulation. We must also be good at rationally and calculatedly spending the accumulated reserves. Do not waste any penny of the people's financial resources, and ensure that the accumulation is mainly used to meet the important needs of our industrialization... Being good at rationally and calculatedly spending financial resources is the most important art, and this art cannot be successful all at once." Therefore, it is necessary to take various measures, rationally use accumulation, implement a strict system of thrift, avoid waste, avoid dispersion, avoid squandering it on unnecessary uses, and avoid letting it deviate from the basic line of industrial construction. Comrade Stalin also pointed out in the same work that it is necessary to take the following most important measures to save our accumulation and reserves: First, an industrial plan must be formulated on the basis of accurate calculation of national resources and national reserves; second, the state organs must be reduced and simplified from bottom to top; third, a firm struggle must be waged against various extravagance and waste phenomena in the management organs and in our daily life; fourth, a systematic struggle must be waged against corruption that steals state public property; fifth, it is necessary to eliminate absenteeism in factories, improve labor productivity, and consolidate labor discipline in enterprises.

As a result of implementing this method of accumulation and austerity system, the Soviet Union had a large amount of funds invested in industrial construction, and the problem of funding sources was successfully resolved. The total investment in the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union was 51 billion rubles, and it reached 115 billion rubles in the second five-year plan. Most of these funds were used to develop industry and transportation. The Soviet Union created hundreds and thousands of new factories with first-class modern technology equipment in a very short period of time, and some old factories also implemented technological transformations.

(V) On the Cadres for National Industrialization

In order to realize the task of national industrialization, not only a large amount of funds is needed, but also a large number of industrial construction cadres are needed. The cadre issue is also one of the important issues of industrialization. In his article "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy," Comrade Stalin said: "Any task, especially such a huge task as our national industrialization, cannot be implemented without energetic people, without new people, without new construction cadres." He also said in his article "The Year of the Great Turn": "...But before the cadre issue is resolved, it cannot be said that the issue of heavy industry construction has been completely resolved." The construction talents referred to by Comrade Stalin are new talents who are loyal to the cause of the working class, master advanced science and technology, and are familiar with their own business, such as excellent factory managers, trust managers, and intelligent designers of industrial construction.

But how to solve the cadre problem? Comrade Stalin pointed out in his article "The Year of the Great Turn": "...(1) We must absorb hundreds of thousands of technical talents and experts who support the Soviet regime to participate in the cause of socialist construction; (2) We must train new red technicians and red experts from among the working class." Regarding the work of absorbing old technical personnel and experts to engage in socialist construction, it was relatively difficult in the Soviet Union at that time. Because many old technical personnel and experts still retained strong bourgeois ideas and could not stand on the position of supporting the Soviet regime, and some of them even personally engaged in assassination activities. However, because the Soviet Union adopted a correct policy towards old technical personnel in various periods, coupled with the continuous victory of Soviet socialist construction, the vast majority of old technical personnel and experts had been absorbed to participate in the construction cause two years after the start of the first five-year plan. Regarding the issue of training new red technicians and red experts, this is the main way to solve the cadre problem. For this reason, the Soviet Union opened many schools of various types to train construction talents on the one hand, and widely established workers' supplementary schools in factories and mines on the other hand, and as a result, trained a large number of construction talents in the shortest period of time. For example, during the first five-year plan period, the number of students in secondary technical schools and workers' supplementary schools alone increased from 264,000 in 1928 to 1,437,000 in 1932; as for the number of students in universities, it increased from 166,000 to 500,000 during the same period; the number of scientific workers also doubled during the same period.

Comrade Stalin appropriately raised the cadre issue at all stages of socialist industrialization, and in practice guided the resolution of this issue. For example, after the Shakhty affair occurred in 1928, Comrade Stalin instructed that the party should learn a lesson from this incident, that the party's economic workers themselves should be proficient in production technology, so that the saboteurs among the old experts would not be able to deceive them in the future; it is necessary to strengthen the creation of new technical cadres from the ranks of the working class. At that time, according to the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, the work of higher technical schools to train young experts was improved. (See "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," page 360) As another example, during the second five-year plan, because all sectors of the national economy, especially the industrial sector, had obtained a large number of new technologies, new machines, and new lathes, which required thousands of trained technical personnel, accelerating the speed of cadre training and quickly learning to use new technologies became a task of paramount importance. Therefore, Comrade Stalin put forward the slogan "Cadres Decide Everything" in this situation. Believing that "talents and cadres are the most valuable and most decisive capital among all valuable capital in the world." ("Speech at the Graduation Ceremony of Students of the Red Army Academy held in the Kremlin") Everyone should pay special attention to talents and cadres.

(VI) Learning from the Example of Soviet National Industrialization

The infinite correctness of Comrade Stalin's theory on socialist industrialization has now been proven by the reality of Soviet socialist construction. The task of national industrialization put forward by Comrade Stalin at the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party has been gloriously completed by the Soviet people under the leadership of Comrade Stalin. The Soviet Union transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country in a short period of thirteen years before the war. After World War II, industrial production in the Soviet Union has had even greater development. The Soviet Union is now the most advanced first-class power in the world, all sectors of the national economy are armed with the latest technology, the material and cultural life of the people has been greatly improved, and the strength of national defense and military has become extremely powerful. It has withstood the severe test of World War II, it is already the staunch fortress of the current international peace and democracy camp, and it is transitioning from socialism to a better communism. Therefore, it is inseparable from learning Comrade Stalin's theory on industrialization and learning from the experience of Soviet economic construction.

Now, our country has entered a period of large-scale economic construction, and China's first five-year plan in history has begun. The general task of this five-year plan is to gradually transform China from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country, that is, to gradually realize national industrialization. In order to accomplish this arduous task, we must strive to study Comrade Stalin's theory on industrialization and learn from the valuable experience of Soviet construction.

First of all, regarding the method of industrialization, we should follow Comrade Stalin's instructions and learn from the Soviet method of developing heavy industry first, and resolutely implement the policy of focusing on key construction. Only by grasping this decisive link and concentrating our efforts to carry it out can we ensure the realization of national industrialization. We must oppose the idea that everything should be revived; in particular, we must oppose localism and departmentalism that disregard the overall situation. Of course, concentrating our efforts to build heavy industry must not be understood as that light industry and agriculture can be neglected. Light industry and agriculture must also develop accordingly with the development of heavy industry.

Secondly, regarding the speed of industrialization, we should follow Comrade Stalin's instructions, learn from the experience of Soviet construction, and ensure that the speed of our country's industrialization greatly exceeds the speed of any capitalist country. Because our current economic and technological level is even more backward than that of the Soviet Union when it began construction, and our economic construction is carried out under the conditions of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and US imperialism is still conspiring to expand the war of aggression, so we must step up construction and rapidly increase our defense strength and economic strength. All negative ideas and conservative ideas that delay the speed of our industrialization are wrong. Of course, this high-speed development must not be understood as blind rashness. We must advance steadily according to the country's strength and conditions.

Thirdly, regarding the funds for industrialization, we must also learn from the Soviet example, rely on our own resources, rely on our own internal accumulation, and at the same time, implement a strict system of thrift and rationally use funds. For this reason, we must oppose corruption and waste, streamline the organization, establish a strict unified financial system and financial discipline, especially to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, strengthen economic accounting system, reduce non-production expenses, and reduce costs. In a word, increasing production and practicing economy is the main way for us to solve the problem of funds.

Fourthly, regarding the cadres for industrialization, we must also learn from the Soviet experience. In addition to transferring a group of excellent cadres from other departments to work in industry, especially in basic construction departments, we must also absorb the original old technical personnel and experts to participate in the construction cause, and pay special attention to vigorously training new technical personnel and experts. Most of the original technical personnel and experts in our country support the people's democratic regime, and the vast majority of them have now participated in the construction work of the motherland; however, because many old ideas, old styles, and bourgeois technical viewpoints still remain in them, we need to help them carry out conscious ideological transformation in order to become the most useful talents for the country. We should pay great attention to cultivating new construction talents. Our government is establishing some intermediate and advanced technical schools, improving and expanding many middle schools and universities, and widely establishing technical and cultural supplementary schools in industrial and mining enterprises. All these measures are completely necessary and correct, and the party must strengthen its leadership over these tasks.

In addition, regarding the industrialization plan, the issue of regional distribution, and the issue of the party's leadership over industrial construction, we must also learn from the Soviet example.

In short, in the past we "took the road of the Russians," so our revolution was victorious; now the construction after our revolution is still to "take the road of the Russians." The Soviet Union's yesterday is our today, and the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. Comrade Mao Zedong has asked us to learn from the Soviet Union in many documents. Recently, in his article "The Greatest Friendship," he said: "The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people will work harder to study Stalin's theories, and learn from Soviet science and technology to build our country." We must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, and learn from the Soviet Union with humility, hard work, and sincerity, and be good at applying the Soviet experience in construction to our own specific conditions.

We believe that under the correct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, we have an advanced people's democratic regime and economic system, we have hundreds of millions of people, we have infinitely rich resources, and at the same time, we have a good example from the Soviet Union and their great selfless assistance to us. As long as we step up our work and study harder, although we have many difficulties and lack experience, we will surely be victorious. The bright and splendid prospect of national industrialization is attracting us. We are moving forward bravely!

    斯大林论国家工业化
    沙英
    （一）斯大林是社会主义工业化理论的创造者
    毛泽东同志为悼念斯大林同志而作的“最伟大的友谊”一文中说：“斯大林同志全面地划时代地发展了马克思列宁主义的理论，把马克思主义的发展推进到新的阶段。”
    斯大林同志关于国家工业化的理论，是列宁、斯大林关于在一个国家内可能建成社会主义的理论的发展和具体化，是对于科学共产主义理论的伟大贡献之一。
    当列宁在世的时候，他不仅对苏联过渡时期最初阶段的经济作了光辉的科学分析，而且也对苏联工业化和农业集体化作了重要的指示。远在伟大的十月革命的前夜，列宁就曾着重指出，俄国不仅要在政治方面，而且要在经济与技术方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家，这是俄国一个生死存亡的问题。在列宁的著作中，曾屡次强调了以发展工业
    （特别是重工业）来建立社会主义物质基础的重要性。还在一九一八年四月，列宁就拟定了“科学技术工作计划大纲”，不过由于当时国内战争爆发，这个计划未能实现。列宁对于发展苏联国民经济、发展重工业的思想，特别鲜明地体现在一九二○年十二月制订的全俄电气化计划中。这个计划是依照列宁的指示及联共第九次代表大会的决议而制定的。这个计划是将整个国民经济转移到现代大规模生产的技术基础上去的计划。当时斯大林同志在致列宁的信中，曾极力称赞了这个计划，认为它是
    “真正统一的与真正国家性的经济计划的一个精密提纲”。
    当列宁逝世之后，斯大林同志继承了列宁的遗志，把列宁的理想变为活生生的现实。斯大林同志对社会主义工业化问题作了深刻的研究，总结了苏联实现工业化政策的斗争经验，真正完成了社会主义工业化的理论，科学地指明了苏联社会主义建设的道路。关于社会主义工业化的方法问题，速度问题，资金问题，干部问题等等一系列的问题，他都作了系统的科学的论证。并且在实际上，斯大林同志是苏联社会主义国家工业化的创造者、鼓舞者和组织者，苏联工业化的辉煌成绩与社会主义的伟大胜利，都是与斯大林的名字密切联系在一起的。
    斯大林同志关于国家工业化的理论是有伟大的国际意义的。它不仅是苏联建设社会主义和共产主义的科学方案，而且欧洲各人民民主国家和我们中国的建设，也都要遵循斯大林的工业化理论前进。它就像万丈光芒的探照灯一样，照明了我们走向社会主义和共产主义的大道。
    （二）关于国家工业化的方法问题
    为什么要进行国家工业化呢？工业化的任务是什么呢？斯大林同志一九三五年五月在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说中追述苏联所走过的道路时说：“大家知道，我们从旧时代方面所得到的遗产，是一个技术落后的国家，几乎是赤贫的，破产的国家。它是既被四年帝国主义战争所破坏了，又被三年国内战争所破坏了的，其中居民很少识字，技术落后，工业好像个别孤岛一样沉没在无数极小农庄这一汪洋大海中，——这就是旧时代所遗传给我们的国家。……”
    当俄国在革命之前，工业生产水平远远落后于其他资本主义国家。一九一三年沙皇俄国在世界工业产量中所占的比重为百分之二点六，而当时美国所占的比重则为百分之三十八点二，英国为百分之十二点一。一九一三年俄国所生产的工业品，按人口平均计算，等于英国的九分之二，等于法国的七分之二。工业在整个国民经济中的比重，也仅占百分之四十二点一。当苏联国民经济恢复时期终结时，苏联人民经过四年有余的艰苦奋斗，在短促的时期内医治了战争给经济所带来的创伤，不论工业和农业都迅速地恢复起来，并已接近到战前的水平。到一九二五年，苏联大工业的生产量已约占战前产量的四分之三，农业也达到战前水准百分之八十七。为此，斯大林同志在一九二五年十二月联共（布）第十四次代表大会上的报告中说，虽然当时苏联的经济迅速恢复了，但并不要以此自满，因为苏联依然是一个落后的农业国。当时农业产品在全部出产总量中占三分之二，而工业却只占三分之一。于是为社会主义的国家工业化而斗争，为社会主义胜利而斗争，便成了当时苏联社会主义建设的基本环节。斯大林同志当时这样指示说：“把我国由农业国变成能自力出产必需装备品的工业国，——这就是我们总路线底实质和基础。”（“在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上关于大会对中央政治工作总结报告讨论经过的结论”）
    为国家工业化而斗争，并不是一般的发展各种工业，而主要的是发展重工业，特别是发展重工业的核心，即机器制造业。斯大林同志在许多著作中都强调了发展重工业的重要性，一贯主张生产资料的生产要占优先地位。例如他在“论苏联经济形势与党底政策”一文中这样写道：“有些同志以为工业化一般地就是各种工业的发展。……当然，这是不正确的。不是工业之任何发展都算做工业化。工业化底中心，其基础，是在于重工业（燃料、五金等）底发展，归根结底，是生产资料生产之发展，是在于本国的机器制造业之发展。”
    为什么强调发展大工业（首先是重工业）呢？斯大林同志深刻地论证了作为社会主义经济基础的大工业的作用。这种作用是在于：第一，大工业本身集中了一切科学与技术的成就，保证社会主义社会有比资本主义社会更高的生产力的水平。第二，大工业是工人阶级专政的基础，大工业的发展是意味着工人阶级人数的增多，意味着工人阶级在社会中比重的增长，从而可以巩固工人阶级专政，加强工人阶级对千百万劳动群众的领导权。第三，大工业的发展，能够制造出大量的拖拉机、联合收割机和现代农业机器，以便用之来改造农业，使农业走上社会主义的道路。第四，大工业能生产一切国民经济部门进行技术改造所必需的生产资料，保证国家经济与政治的独立性。第五，大工业能生产大量的现代化新式武器，保证国家国防的巩固和军事经济实力的增长。第六，在大工业强大发展的基础上，才能解决在经济上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家的任务。
    正由于这样的理由，所以必须首先保证重工业的发展，必须建立强大的机器制造业。斯大林同志认为这是工业化的主要环节，是改造一切国民经济部门的基本关键，是社会主义国家获得经济政治独立的必由之路，同时也是完全符合于苏联人民的长远利益和根本利益的。斯大林同志在其最后一部著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，还一再指出，在国家工业化的过程中，必须让生产资料的生产占优先地位。他说：“生产资料生产的增长之所以必须占优先地位，不仅是因为这种生产应当保证自己的企业以及国民经济其他一切部门的企业所需要的装备，而且是因为没有这种生产就根本不可能实现扩大再生产。”
    苏联为了在最短的时期内实现这种经济建设的艰巨任务，自然不能采取资本主义工业化的方法，而
    一定要采取为斯大林同志所发现的社会主义工业化的方法。斯大林同志于一九四六年二月在莫斯科斯大林选区选民大会上的演说中指出：苏联的国家工业化方法，是与资本主义的工业化方法根本不同的。资本主义国家工业化通常都是从轻工业方面开始。因为轻工业较之重工业，所需的投资数量少些，资本周转得快些，而且获利也容易些，所以那里的轻工业，也就成为工业化的首先对象。只有经过一个长时期，让轻工业积蓄一些利润而将其集中于银行以后，才开始逐渐把积蓄的资本转用到重工业中去。苏联所采取的工业化的方法，则与之相反，而是从发展重工业来开始实行国家工业化。虽然这是一件极困难的事情，但这种困难是可以克服的。
    由此可见，生产资料的生产（重工业）之发展占优先地位，在生产资料生产发展的基础上，有计划地发展生活资料的生产，这是苏联社会主义国家工业化的总方针和总路线。
    （三）关于国家工业化的速度问题
    工业化的速度问题，在斯大林同志关于工业化的理论中占着很重要的地位。斯大林同志在一九二六年至一九三一年的著作中，曾屡次强调指出，苏联的国家工业化必须用非常的速度、用“真正布尔什维克的速度”紧张地进行，以便很快地赶上并超过资本主义国家。
    斯大林同志一九二八年在苏联共产党中央全体会议上以“论国家工业化与联共（布）党内的右倾”为题的演说中说道：“一般工业尤其是生产工具的生产迅速的发展是国家工业化的基础，也就是在社会主义发展的基础上来改造我们全部国民经济的钥匙。但是究竟什么是迅速的发展工业呢？这就是说，多投资到工业中去。但这非使我们的一切计划，无论预算内的或预算外的，都紧张起来不可。”为什么一切计划都要这样“紧张”呢？斯大林同志说，这并不是由于苏联共产党中央政治局和人民委员会委员们的“性质浮躁”，而是由于当时苏联国内外的环境使得苏联不能用比较缓慢的速度来发展工业。斯大林同志详细地分析了苏联当时的内外环境，指出苏联当时是在技术非常落后的国家内夺得了政权，而且苏联当时是在资本主义包围中唯一的无产阶级专政的国家，为了在经济上赶上和超过先进的资本主义国家，苏联非以很快的速度发展工业不可。同时，苏联当时国内的农业技术及文化都非常落后，散漫零碎的小商品生产占多数，社会主义的大工业还是“大海中的一个岛屿”，因此，为了在新的技术基础上加速及推进农村经济的改造，也必须使工业发展的速度加快。
    对此，斯大林同志一九三一年在“论经济工作人员底任务”一文中也这样说过：“人们有时发问：难道不可稍许减低速度，延缓进展速度么？不行的，不可以的，同志们！决不可减低速度！恰巧相反，还必须竭力和尽可能增加速度哩。我们在苏联工农面前所负的义务要我们这样做。我们在全世界工人阶级面前所负的义务要我们这样做。”
    苏联由于正确地执行了斯大林的指示，实行了加紧发展工业的政策，党好似是鞭策了国家，所以苏联工业的发展速度是突飞猛进的。苏联大工业的生产量，从一九二五年到一九二九年，增加了百分之一五○点六，而资本主义各国在此同时期内，不过增加了百分之一九。到一九五一年，苏联的工业产量为一九二九年的百分之一千二百六十六，即这个时期差不多增加了十二倍。而美国的工业生产，一九五一年比一九二九年仅增加了一倍。
    苏联的大工业所以发展这样快，斯大林同志在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上的报告中指出，其原因是在于：第一、因为它是国有化的工业，可以免除资本家追求私利的阻碍，而按照整个社会的利益发展起来。第二、它是世界上最宏大、最集中的工业。第三、因为国有化的运输事业、信用事业、对外贸易、总预算等都完全掌握在国家手中，国家可以有计划地领导国有化的工业，使它成为统一的工业经济。第四、因为国有化的工业是最大最强有力的工业，它可以实施不断地减低成本、减低商品价格的政策，来扩大销售市场，增加国内市场的容量；在城市与乡村、工人与农民联合的环境中发展起来，替自己造成不断扩大生产的源泉。第五、由于国有化的工业依靠工人阶级，很容易提高技术和生产率，很容易实施生产与管理的合理化。以上各点，都是社会主义制度优于资本主义制度的明显铁证。
    斯大林同志同时指出：对于工业发展的速度必须正确地掌握，既不能保守，也不能冒进。一九二六年他在“论苏联经济形势与党底政策”一文中说：
    “必须使我们的工业计划不是按官僚主义虚构的办法制定的，而要与我们国民经济的情况、与我们资源、后备力量底精确核计密切联系起来。不能在工业建设之计划上落后于工业的发展。但也不能跑向前去，脱离我国的农业、不顾我国的积累速度。”
    为了说明掌握工业的发展速度必须根据具体情况，我们还可以在斯大林同志的“第一个五年计划底总结”一文中找到有力的论证。他指出：由于第一个五年计划顺利完成的结果，在工业、运输业和农业上已创立了现代技术的基础，国防能力已提高到了应有的高度，苏联已建成许多拥有新式复杂技术的大工厂和联合厂，“正因为如此，所以我认为我们在第二个五年计划时期，必须采取较慢的工业出产量增长速度。”（“第一个五年计划底总结”）要用更多的时间使工人和工程技术人员来熟悉新工厂新技术，认真提高劳动生产率，认真减低成本。以保证在第二个五年计划后半期开始的时候，无论在建设方面或在工业生产的增长方面，都实行一个新的迅速的跑步。
    （四）关于国家工业化的资金问题
    为了实现国家工业化，为了建立重工业及在最新基础上彻底改造整个国民经济，就需要巨量的资金。因此，资金的积累问题是工业化的重要问题之一。
    资本主义国家的工业化，除了对本国工人和农民进行无情的剥削外，外国资金的流入有很大的作用。斯大林同志在总结资本主义国家发展的历史经验时，指出了资本主义国家三种资金积累的方法：靠掠夺殖民地（如英国），靠军事赔款（如德国），靠奴役性的借款和租让（如沙皇俄国）。可是对于社会主义国家的苏联来说，这些积累资金的方式是不能采用的。斯大林同志以科学方法研究了这个问题，在苏联国内找到了资金的来源。
    这种资金的来源就是：苏维埃国家把十月社会主义革命从资本家地主手中夺取过来的一切工厂，一切土地，以及运输业、银行、对外贸易和国内商业，都一律收归自己掌握。现在从国家工厂中，从运输业、商业和银行方面所获得的利润，已不是用于供给资本家寄生阶级耗费，而是用于继续扩大工业了。苏维埃政权取消了沙皇政府所借的外债，过去人民单只为偿付这种外债的利息，每年就要付出数万万金卢布。苏维埃政权既将地主的土地所有权消灭，就使农民免除了每年必须向地主缴纳的约及五万万金卢布的地租。农民因为摆脱了这一切重担，所以能够帮助国家来创立新的强大的工业。（参见“联共（布）党史简明教程”三四六页）所有这些收入的泉源，都掌握在苏维埃国家手中。这些泉源能够提供巨量的资金供给建设重工业之用。
    不过以上只是积累资金的可能性，可是为了把这种可能性变为现实性，斯大林同志指出，必需抓紧经济生活的几个关节：一、将国内积累的盈余集中于信用机关，不让它浪费，并举办国内公债，首先利用它们于工业的需要；二、缜密地杜塞一切漏洞，不要使国内积累的一部分盈余流入私人资本家的腰包。三、在工业内部，保存一些贮备金，作为修缮企业和扩大企业之用。四、在国家手里积累一些后备金，作为防备意外事件（如歉收等）及培养工业、扶助农业和发展文化之用。
    斯大林同志一九三一年六月在以“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”为题的演说中指出：除了加强旧的积累来源，苏联又找到一个新的积累来源，即施行并巩固经济核算制，提高工业内部的积累。他说：“我们已不可专靠轻工业，专靠预算上的积累，专靠由农业方面得到的收入了。……还有什么呢？还有重工业。所以，必须设法使重工业——首先是机器制造业——也能拿出积累来。”为此，
    “就要消灭浪费现象，尽量动用工业内部的资源，在我们所有一切企业内施行并巩固经济核算制，有系统地减低成本费，在所有一切而无例外的工业部门里加强工业内部的积累。”
    不过积累资金还只是事情的一方面，另一方面还要正当地利用我们的资金。斯大林同志在一九二六年四月“论苏联经济形势与党底政策”一文中说：
    “不过事情不限于也不能限于积累而已。还要善于合理地、有计算地支出积累起来的后备金，不要白白花掉人民财力的任何一文，要使积累基本上用于满足我国工业化的重要需要。……善于合理地、有计算地支出财力——这是一件最重要的艺术，这种艺术是不能一下子成功的。”因此，必须采取多种办法，合理地使用积累，实行严格地节约制度，避免浪费，避免分散，避免把它糟塌于不需要的用途，避免使它离开工业建设的基本路线。斯大林同志在同一著作中并且指出，必需采取以下几项最重要的办法，来节用我们的积累及后备金：一、必须在精确计算国家资源与国家后备的基础上，制订工业计划；二、必须自下而上地缩减与简化国家机关；三、必须对管理机关中及我们日常生活中的各种铺张浪费现象进行坚决的斗争；四、必须与盗窃国家公共财产的贪污行为进行有系统的斗争；五、必须消灭工厂里的旷工现象、提高劳动生产率、巩固企业中的劳动纪律。
    由于实行了这种积累方法和节约制度，结果就使苏联有大量的资金投之于工业建设，胜利地解决了资金来源问题。苏联第一个五年计划中投资总额为五百一十亿卢布，第二个五年计划中已达一千一百五十亿卢布。这些资金大部都用到发展工业和运输业方面去了。使苏联在极短期间内创立了成百成千座具有头等现代技术装备的新工厂，一些旧工厂也以新技术实行了改造。（五）关于国家工业化的干部问题
    为了实现国家工业化的任务，不仅要有大量的资金，还要有大量的工业建设干部。干部问题也是工业化的重要问题之一。斯大林同志在“论苏联经济形势与党底政策”一文中说道：“任何一个任务，特别是像我们国家工业化这样的巨大任务，没有生气勃勃的人，没有新的人，没有新的建设干部，是不可能实行的。”他在“大转变的一年”一文中也说：“……但在干部问题尚未解决以前，是不可说重工业建成问题已经完全解决了的。”斯大林同志所指的这种建设人材，就是忠实于工人阶级事业的、掌握先进科学技术和熟悉自己业务的新的人材，例如优秀的工厂经理、托辣斯经理、聪明的工业建设的设计师等等。
    可是干部问题怎样解决呢？斯大林同志在“大转变的一年”一文中曾这样指出：“……（1）我们要吸收成千成万拥护苏维埃政权的技术人材和专门家来参加社会主义建设事业，（2）我们要从工人阶级中间培养新起的红色技师和红色专门家。”关于吸收旧的技术人员和专门家来从事社会主义建设的工作，在苏联当时是比较困难的。因为当时许多旧技术人员和专门家还保有浓厚的资产阶级思想，还不能够站在拥护苏维埃政权的立场上，其中有的甚至还亲自进行暗害勾当。可是由于苏联在各个时期都采取了正确地对待旧技术人员的政策，再加上苏联社会主义建设不断地胜利，到第一个五年计划开始两年之后，已经把极大多数的旧技术人员和专门家吸收过来参加建设事业了。关于培养新的红色技师和红色专门家的问题，这是解决干部问题的主要办法。为此，苏联一方面开办了许多各种各样训练建设人材的学校，一方面在工厂矿山中广泛建立工人补习学校，结果就在最短期间训练出大批的建设人材。例如在第一个五年计划期内，仅中等技术学校和工人补习学校的学生人数，就从一九二八年的二十六万四千人升到一九三二年的一百四十三万七千人；至于高等学校的学生人数，在同时期内则从十六万六千人升至五十万人；科学工作者的人数在同时期内也增加了一倍。
    斯大林同志在社会主义工业化的一切阶段上，都恰当地提出干部问题，并在实际上指导了这一问题的解决。例如当一九二八年发生了沙赫特事件之后，斯大林同志即指示说：党应从此事件中取得教训，党的经济工作人员自己应精通生产技术，使旧的专门家中的暗害分子今后不能欺骗他们；必须加强从工人阶级队伍中造就新的技术干部。当时根据联共中央的决议，改善了高等技术学校培养青年专门家的工作。（参见“联共（布）党史简明教程”三六○页）再如在第二个五年计划中，因为国民经济一切部门，首先是工业部门，已获得了大量新的技术、新的机器与新的车床，这就需要成千成万经过训练的技术人员，因此，加紧速度培养干部，赶快学会利用新技术，就成了有头等重要的任务。于是斯大林同志在这种情况下就提出“干部决定一切”的口号。认为“人材，干部是世界上所有一切宝贵资本中最宝贵最有决定意义的资本”。（“在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说”）要大家特别重视人材、重视干部。
    （六）学习苏联国家工业化的榜样
    斯大林同志关于社会主义工业化理论的无限正确，现在已被苏联社会主义建成的现实生活所证明了。斯大林同志在联共第十四次代表大会上所提出的国家工业化的任务，苏联人民已在斯大林同志领导下光荣地完成了。苏联在战前用了十三年短促的时间，就由一个落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。苏联在世界第二次大战以后，工业生产又有了更高的发展。苏联现在已经是世界上最先进的头等强国了，所有国民经济部门都以最新的技术武装起来了，人民的物质与文化生活大大地提高了，国防与军事的力量已经强大无比。它经受过世界第二次大战的严重考验，它已是目前国际和平民主阵营的坚强堡垒，并且它正在从社会主义过渡向更美好的共产主义。因此，目前学习斯大林同志关于工业化的理论，是和学习苏联经济建设的经验分不开的。
    现在，我们国家进入了大规模经济建设的时期，中国有史以来未有的第一个五年计划已经开始了。这个五年计划的总任务，就是要使中国由落后的农业国逐步变为强大的工业国，即逐步实现国家工业化。为了完成这种艰巨的任务，我们必须努力学习斯大林同志关于工业化的理论，学习苏联建设的宝贵经验。
    首先，关于工业化的方法问题，我们应遵循斯大林同志的指示，学习苏联首先发展重工业的方法，坚决贯彻重点建设的方针。我们只有抓着这种决定的环节，集中力量去进行，才能保证国家工业化的实现。我们要反对那种百废俱兴的思想；特别是要反对那种不顾全局的地方主义和本位主义。当然，集中力量建设重工业，决不能了解为可以忽视轻工业和农业，轻工业和农业也要跟着重工业的发展而相应的发展起来。
    其次，关于工业化的速度问题，我们应当遵循斯大林同志的指示，学习苏联建设的经验，保证我国工业化的速度大大超过任何资本主义国家的速度。因为我们目前的经济技术水平比苏联开始建设时还要落后些，而且我们的经济建设又是在抗美援朝的条件下进行的，美帝国主义还在阴谋扩大侵略战争，所以我们必须加紧建设，迅速增长我们的国防力量和经济力量。所有一切延缓我们工业化速度的消极思想和保守思想都是错误的。当然，这种高速度的发展决不能了解为可以盲目冒进，我们一定要根据国家的实力和条件，有计划地稳步前进。
    第三，关于工业化的资金问题，我们也要学习苏联的榜样，必须依靠自己的资源，依靠自己内部的积累，同时要厉行节约制度，合理地使用资金。为此，我们要反对贪污浪费，精简机关编制，建立严格的统一的财政制度和财政纪律，特别是要提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，加强经济核算制，减少非生产开支，降低成本。概括一句话，增产节约是我们解决资金问题的主要办法。
    第四，关于工业化的干部问题，我们也要学习苏联的经验，除了从其他部门抽调一批优秀的干部到工业中去，特别是到基本建设部门去工作以外，也要吸收原有的旧技术人员和专门家来参加建设事业，并特别注意大力培养新的技术人员和专门家。我国原有的技术人员和专门家，大都是拥护人民民主政权的，现在绝大多数都已参加了祖国的建设工作；不过由于他们之中还残存着许多旧思想、旧作风和资产阶级的技术观点，需要帮助他们进行自觉的思想改造，才能成为国家最有用的人材。我们对培养新的建设人材，应当寄予极大的注意。我国政府正在建立一些中级、高级的技术学校，正在改进和扩大许多中学和大学，正在工矿企业广泛设立技术与文化补习学校，所有这些措施，都是完全必要的正确的，党要加强对这些工作的领导。
    此外，关于工业化的计划问题，地区分布问题，以及党对工业建设的领导问题等等，我们同样也要学习苏联的榜样。
    总之，过去我们“走俄国人的路”，所以我们的革命胜利了；现在我们革命胜利后的建设，仍然要“走俄国人的路”。苏联的昨天是我们的今天，苏联的今天是我们的明天。毛泽东同志在许多文件中都要求我们好好地向苏联学习，最近他在“最伟大的友谊”一文中又说：“中国共产党人和中国人民将更加紧学习斯大林的学说，学习苏联的科学和技术，以建设我们的国家。”我们一定要遵照毛泽东同志的指示，虚心地、努力地、诚心诚意地向苏联学习，并善于把苏联的建设经验运用到我们自己的具体条件下来。
    我们相信：在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的正确领导下，我们有先进的人民民主政权和经济制度，我们有数亿人口，我们有无限丰富的资源，同时我们又有苏联的良好的榜样及他们对我们伟大无私的援助，只要我们加紧工作和加紧学习，虽然我们有很多困难，虽然我们缺乏经验，但是我们一定要胜利的。国家工业化的光明灿烂的前景在吸引着我们，我们勇敢地前进！
