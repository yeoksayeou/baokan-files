Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Song Qingling, sent a message of greetings to the Second National Women's Congress of China. The full text is as follows:

Dear Sisters:

I take this opportunity of the opening of the Second National Women's Congress to extend my warm congratulations to you. I wish you a victorious success in accomplishing the purpose of this important meeting and further promoting the complete liberation of Chinese women.

This is the most appropriate time to bring together women representatives from all walks of life and all regions of the country. We have already completed the land reform and various transformation movements, and have entered the era of industrialization. In our lives, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea remains one of the main tasks, and we are developing this struggle to new heights. Because our regime is firmly in the hands of the working people, both men and women, we will hold people's congresses at all local levels and the first National People's Congress, and promulgate the first constitution of our People's Republic.

You know that none of these are ordinary events. Obviously, to make our plans and programs fruitful, we still need to make great efforts. Everyone needs to exert unprecedented creativity and establish new standards in all aspects. This requirement, of course, is no exception for women.

The leaders of our Central People's Government understand our history very well. They know that no revolutionary movement can succeed without the participation of women. They know that the socialist construction of the Soviet Union was impossible "without the active participation of the broad masses of working women." They know that unless we rely on the majority of women to actively exert their full capabilities, our revolutionary goals cannot be achieved.

Today, in our country, the law has affirmed that women have equal status with men. In fact, women have already enjoyed the rights that only a New Democratic or socialist country can grant. We have made great progress in eradicating the feudal relations of inequality between men and women, especially as a result of the activities of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, which has widely disseminated and implemented the law. However, we also know that Chinese women are not yet fully liberated and that greater efforts are still needed.

First of all, the view of male superiority over female inferiority is not only deeply rooted but also omnipresent, and it manifests itself in thoughts and actions at any time. This shortcoming needs to be corrected through repeated and continuous education, rather than being eradicated immediately.

Secondly, women everywhere are bound by heavy household work. This not only prevents them from participating in production, but also hinders their development, preventing them from advancing with society and from advancing themselves according to society's requirements for citizens.

These are the most important issues. The resolution of these issues is a key issue for safeguarding the interests of the entire People's Republic. Unless a large number of Chinese women participate in industrial, agricultural, and cultural work, it will not be easy to promote our country's progress at the necessary and possible speed by completely liberating half of the labor force in the population. Women can, should, and must become technicians, managers, teachers, tractor drivers, engineers, scientists, and various skilled workers. We are already moving in this direction, but making this movement mass-based is truly our goal.

Therefore, regarding the plan for women's future work, I suggest that the following points be considered:

One, we must continue to educate the people to value the protection of women's rights, not only the rights to equality with men in political and economic aspects, but also their special rights.

Two, we must provide more maternity hospitals, nurseries, schools, and other facilities in order to gradually liberate women from heavy household work.

Three, we must intensify the work of eliminating illiteracy and set up more training institutions so that women can freely choose their professions.

Four, we must improve women's political awareness and strengthen their organizational ties to ensure that they participate as actively and extensively as possible in the country's political activities.

The complete liberation of Chinese women means the stability and strength of our country. A strong, vibrant China, closely working together with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and all progressive humanity, is a strong bulwark of world peace.

### 中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席  宋庆龄给妇女代表大会的贺词

    中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席
    宋庆龄给妇女代表大会的贺词
    【新华社十六日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席宋庆龄给中国第二次全国妇女代表大会的贺词。全文如下：亲爱的姊妹们：
    我趁这第二次全国妇女代表大会开会的机会，向你们致热烈的祝贺。我愿望你们胜利成功，完成这个重要会议的目的和进一步推动中国妇女的完全解放。
    这是一个最适当的时机来把全国各阶层各地区的妇女代表们聚集一堂。我们已经是完成了土地改革和各种改造运动，且开始了工业化的时期。在我们生活中，抗美援朝仍然是主要任务之一，我们正在把这个斗争发展到新的高度。由于我们的政权是巩固的掌握在男女劳动人民的手中，我们将要举行地方各级人民代表大会和首次全国人民代表大会并公布我们的人民共和国的第一个宪法。
    你们知道，这一系列都不是平凡的事件。显然地要使我们的计划和方案获得成果，我们还须要作很大的努力。每一个人都需要发挥空前的创造性并在各方面建立起新的标准。这个要求对于妇女当然也是不能例外的。
    我们的中央人民政府的领袖们很了解我们的历史。他们知道，没有一个革命运动是没有妇女参加而能成功的。他们知道，苏联社会主义建设“没有广大的劳动妇女积极参加”是不可能的。他们知道，除非信赖大多数的妇女群众积极地发挥她们的全部能力，我们革命的目标就不可能完成。
    今天在我们的国家里，法律已确认妇女与男子有平等的地位。事实上，妇女已经享受到只有新民主主义国家或是社会主义国家才能给予的权利。我们在铲除男女不平等的封建关系方面已有了伟大的进步，这特别是由于全国民主妇女联合会的活动使法律得以广为传播并得以贯彻的结果。不过，我们也知道，中国妇女还没有完全解放，还须要作更大的努力。
    首先就男尊女卑的观点来说，它不但是根深蒂固，而且是防不胜防，在思想行动之中随时就表现出来。这种缺点需要反复不断地教育来改正，而不是立刻可以根绝的。
    其次，妇女们到处都受到家庭繁重工作的束缚。不仅使她们无法参加生产，甚至阻碍了她们的发展，使她们既不能随着社会的前进而前进，又不能依照社会对于公民的要求来使自己前进。
    这些都是最主要的问题。这些问题的解决对于保卫整个人民共和国的利益是关键性的问题。除非中国的妇女大量参加工、农和文化工作，把人口中的一半劳动力完全解放出来就不容易按照必需和可能的速度推动我们国家的前进。妇女能够应该而且必须成为技师、经理、教员、拖拉机手、工程师、科学家和各种熟练的工人。我们已经是向着这个方向在走，但是使这个运动具有群众性才真是我们的目标。
    因此，关于妇女将来的工作的计划，我建议对如下数点加以考虑：
    一、我们必须继续教育人民群众重视保护妇女的权利，不仅在政治、经济方面与男子平等的权利，而且她们也要得到她们的特殊权利。
    二、我们必须提供更多的产科医院、托儿所、学校等设备，以便逐步地把妇女从家庭的繁重工作中解放出来。
    三、我们必须加紧扫除文盲工作，并多设训练机构，使妇女能够自由选择职业。
    四、我们必须提高妇女的政治水平和加强她们的组织联系，保证她们尽量地积极地参加国家的政治活动。
    中国妇女完全解放意味着我们国家的稳固坚强。一个强大的，生气勃勃的，和苏联、人民民主主义国家以及所有进步人类紧密地携手前进的中国就是全世界和平的坚强堡垒。
