Actively Carry Out Spring Plowing and Production Without Missing the Farming Season

    Since mid-March, the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has been actively preparing for spring plowing. This year, the cooperative accumulated 3,700 carts of soil manure and pen manure, and 10,000 catties of ash manure, most of which have now been sent to the fields. The cooperative members have also prepared their rice, firewood, clothing, and shoes. Various crop seeds have been selected and have undergone two germination tests. Horse feed and horse grass have also been prepared.

    This year, the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to produce 775,000 catties of unprocessed grain. The 45 hectares of flat land cultivated using new-style farm tools will begin plowing on April 15th, plowing and harrowing simultaneously, and finishing by the end of the month. The hillside land sown using old farm tools is planned to begin on May 6th, plowing and planting simultaneously. The sowing work is expected to be completed by May 15th.

    The spring land of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, has been completely plowed. This year, their high-yield fields were plowed to a depth of eight inches, and the general fields were plowed to a depth of five inches, all with fine harrowing.

    The Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative has a total of 710 mu of land, of which 345 mu are for spring cultivation. It is planned to produce 185,510 catties of grain, an increase of 61.6% compared to last year.

    Most of the cooperative's labor force has been投入 into spring plowing. Semi-able-bodied men, women, and children are responsible for mashing manure, while young and strong laborers are responsible for transporting manure. As of March 23rd, the cooperative had transported more than 1,100 carts of manure to the four manure yards outside the village and had turned and mashed most of it once. It is now being transported to the fields.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region troops have begun spring sowing. Tractors appeared in the fields of the Junggar Basin and along the Kaidu River, their rumbling sounds echoing from morning to night; on the fertile oases of southern Xinjiang and the plains along the Ili River in northern Xinjiang, large columns of hundreds of horses dragged new-style walking plows through the fields. A certain PLA unit stationed along the Kaidu River sowed more than 1,800 mu of spring wheat in four days. The soldiers of the "August 1st" Mechanized Farm have already sown more than 14,000 mu of spring wheat and more than 10,000 mu of highland barley.

Henan Begins Sowing Tobacco and Cotton

    The famous tobacco of Xuchang Prefecture and the cotton of Henan Province have begun sowing. This year, the preparations for tobacco and cotton sowing in Henan were more thorough and timely than in the past. In the main tobacco-producing areas, such as Xuchang and Nanyang, the amount of fertilizer applied to tobacco fields generally increased by 100% compared to last year. In Jia County, the average amount of fertilizer applied to each mu of tobacco field was more than 5,000 catties. In Anyang County, one of the main cotton-producing areas, 80% of the 420,000 mu of cotton fields were fertilized with base fertilizer. Six prefectures, including Xinxiang, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Anyang, have designated approximately 15,000 mu of cotton yield increase demonstration areas. Key counties have held technical training courses, and cotton seed breeding areas have also been designated. Many cadres and masses have received technical training and education. State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams in various prefectures and counties throughout the province have mostly formulated specific plans to improve cotton cultivation techniques, increase yield per unit area, and support national industrial construction.

Forest Industry in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Develops Rapidly

    In order to supply the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, the forest industry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is developing rapidly. In 1952, the region's timber production more than doubled compared to three years ago, and this year's timber production is expected to exceed last year's by more than 100%. The region's forest industry suffered from looting and destruction by the Japanese invaders. It was not until the establishment of a unified forestry management organization in 1949 that planned harvesting and management began, and advanced experiences such as the Soviet Union's rational harvesting, rational timber production, ice road transportation, and ice-scraping operations were gradually promoted. This not only greatly improved production quality but also saved the country more than 167,000 cubic meters of timber in less than two years.

    Some forest farms have begun to try to use mechanization to replace handicraft production. Last year, the Tulihe Forest Farm used 12 tractors to transport timber. Mechanical log loaders, mobile sawmills, and other machinery have also begun to appear on the forest farms. In addition to the existing forest railway in the Arxan forest area, the railway being built from Kutuer Station on the Binzhou Line to Tulihe in the Greater Khingan Mountains will be fully open to traffic this year.

Exploration of Oil in Xinjiang Achieves Results

    More than a dozen exploration teams from the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation are preparing to continue exploring the rich oil buried underground in Xinjiang. These exploration teams are composed of Chinese and Soviet experts and technicians from the company. In 1952, they operated in the Tarim Basin and the Junggar Basin, north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Cadres, farmers, and herdsmen of all ethnic groups enthusiastically led the exploration teams and reported mineral deposits. After a year of preliminary exploration, they have discovered strata rich in oil in many areas and have also found a large number of oil seepages. Resources buried underground in the motherland for many years will become a valuable asset in our country's economic construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

Successful Trial Production of Fly Ash Waterproof Material

    The Changchun Comprehensive Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has successfully researched fly ash waterproof material for flat roofs of buildings, drawing on advanced Soviet experience.

    In the past, the waterproof layer of flat roofs in our country was generally made of oil felt paper and asphalt. The waterproof performance was very low, and it was easy to leak, especially in areas with drastic temperature changes; at the same time, the cost was also relatively high. Using fly ash waterproof material as the waterproof layer for flat roofs has very high waterproof performance. Spreading this material flat on the flat roof, with a thickness of between twelve and fifteen centimeters, and then adding a layer of concrete slab, can withstand a water pressure of ninety centimeters without leaking, and also has the functions of heat insulation and sound insulation.

    Fly ash waterproof material has been widely used in the Soviet Union. However, other raw materials besides factory chimney ash used in the Soviet Union to manufacture fly ash waterproof material are not available in Northeast China. Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the Changchun Comprehensive Research Institute, based on the principle of Soviet manufacturing of fly ash waterproof material, used No. 4 petroleum asphalt produced in Dalian and green oil produced in Fushun to mix soft asphalt in proportion, and then mixed it with chimney ash from the Fuxin Power Plant in proportion to make waterproof material. After a year of hard research, reliable conclusions were obtained.

Most of the Construction Materials for Anshan Iron and Steel are Transported to the Construction Site

    The main construction materials required for the first quarter of construction at Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been prepared and have mostly been transported to the construction site.

    As early as September last year, the Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel compiled a plan for ordering goods from abroad and allocating materials required by the state. They took the initiative to investigate the amount of work and construction engineering estimates from relevant departments as a basis for formulating material plans. Now, a large number of electrical materials, non-ferrous metal materials, tools, red bricks, wood, plumbing materials, steel, etc., have been continuously transported to Anshan from abroad and all over the country.

    The materials needed by the First Civil Engineering Company, the Large-Scale, Seamless, Furnace Construction, and Industrial Pipeline construction sites for the first quarter have now all been transported to the construction sites. The Second Civil Engineering Company needs the most materials this year. Every day, hundreds of trains, cars, and large vehicles are transporting red bricks, wood, gravel, cement, and other major materials, and most of them have now been transported.

    不违农时积极春耕生产
    吉林省蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社从三月中旬起就积极准备春耕，今年全社攒积了三千七百车土粪、圈粪和一万斤灰粪，现在大部都送到了地里。社员的吃米、烧柴、衣服、鞋子也都准备齐全。各种作物种籽，都已经过挑选，还作了二次发芽试验，马料马草也准备好了。
    今年，韩恩农业生产合作社计划生产七十七万五千斤原粮。全社使用新式农具耕种的四十五垧平原地，将在四月十五日开始翻地，随翻随耙，月末翻完。使用旧农具播种的山坡地，计划从五月六日起，随翻随种。到五月十五日，播种工作可以全部结束。

    山东莒县吕鸿宾农业生产合作社的春地已全部耕完。今年他们的丰产田耕到八寸，一般田耕到五寸，并且都作到了细耙。
    吕鸿宾农业生产合作社共有土地七百一十亩，其中春耕地共三百四十五亩，计划产粮十八万五千五百一十斤，比去年增产百分之六十一点六。
    全社大部劳动力都已投入春耕。男半劳动力和妇女、儿童负责捣粪，青年、壮年负责运粪。到三月二十三日止，全社已有一千一百余车粪运到村外的四个粪场上，并且大部翻捣了一遍，现正向地里搬运。×    ×    ×
    中国人民解放军新疆军区部队开始春播。拖拉机出现在准噶尔盆地和开都河畔的田野里，隆隆的声音从清晨响到夜晚；在富饶的新疆南部的绿洲上和新疆北部伊犁河岸的平原上，有几百匹马的大行列拖着新式步犁在田间耕作。驻开都河畔的解放军某部四天内就播种了一千八百多亩春麦，“八一”机耕农场的战士们，已播完一万四千多亩春麦和一万多亩青棵。河南烟、棉开始播种
    我国著名的河南省许昌专区的烟草和该省的棉花已开始播种。今年河南烟、棉播种前的准备工作，比以往都充分、及时。烟草主要产区——许昌、南阳等地，烟田施肥量一般比去年增加了一倍，郏县烟田施肥量平均每亩五千多斤。主要棉产区之一的安阳县，四十二万亩棉田百分之八十施了底肥。新乡、洛阳、郑州、安阳等六个专区，都划分了约一万五千亩面积的棉花增产示范区，各重点县举办了技术讲习会，同时，又划定了棉花良种繁殖区，许多干部、群众获得了技术传授教育。全省各专区、县国营农场、农业生产合作社和互助组，大部订了改进棉花耕作技术、提高单位面积产量、支援国家工业建设的具体计划。    （新华社）
    内蒙古自治区森林工业迅速发展
    为了供应国家大规模经济建设的需要，内蒙古自治区的森林工业正在迅速发展中。一九五二年全区木材产量比三年前增加一倍多，今年的木材产量预计将比去年超过一倍。该区森林工业曾经遭受过日寇的掠夺和破坏，直到一九四九年成立林业的统一管理机构以后，才开始实行有计划的采伐和管理，并逐渐推广了苏联的合理采伐、合理造材、冰道搬运、刨冰作业等先进经验。这样，不仅使生产质量大大提高，而且不到两年就给国家节省十六万七千多立方公尺的木材。
    有些林场已开始试用机械化来代替手工业生产。图里河林场去年便使用了十二部拖拉机搬运木材，机械出河机、移动制材机等也开始在林场上出现了。除了已有的阿尔山林区的森林铁路外，由滨州线的库图尔站正向大兴安岭图里河修建的铁路，今年就可以全线通车。

    探勘新疆石油的工作有成绩
    中苏石油股份有限公司的十多个探勘队正整装待发，继续探勘埋藏在新疆地下的丰富石油。这些探勘队是由该公司的中苏双方的专家和技术人员组成的。一九五二年，他们曾活动在天山南北的塔里木盆地和准噶尔盆地。各民族干部、农民、牧民都热情地给探勘队带路、报矿。经过一年来的初步探勘，他们已经在很多地区发现了蕴藏有丰富石油的地层，也发现了大量的油苗。多少年来埋藏在祖国地下的资源，将成为我国经济建设中宝贵财富。（新华社）烟灰防水材料试制成功
    中国科学院长春综合研究所吸取苏联先进经验，研究建筑房屋平屋顶的烟灰防水材料已经成功。
    我国平屋顶的防水层，过去一般是用油毡纸和沥青制成。防水效能很低，尤其在温度变化剧烈的地区，常易漏水；同时成本又较高。用烟灰防水材料做平屋顶的防水层，防水效能很高。将这种材料平铺在平屋顶上，厚度在十二厘米到十五厘米之间，上面再作一层混凝土板，就可承受九十厘米高的水压而不漏水，并兼具保温和隔音的作用。
    烟灰防水材料在苏联已广泛使用。但苏联制造烟灰防水材料所用的除工厂烟囱灰以外的其他原料东北地区没有。根据苏联专家的建议，长春综合研究所根据苏联制造烟灰防水材料的原理，利用大连出产的四号石油沥青与抚顺出产的绿油按比例混合成软沥青，再与阜新发电厂的烟囱灰按比例混合，制成了防水材料。经过一年的努力研究，获得了可靠的结论。    （据新华社讯）鞍钢建筑器材大部运到工地
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设第一季度施工需要的主要建筑器材都已准备齐全，现已大部运到工地。
    鞍钢基本建设材料处早在去年九月就编制了向国外订货和需要国家调拨材料的计划。他们主动地到有关部门调查工程量和建筑工程概算等，做为制定材料计划的根据。现在大量电气材料、有色金属材料、工具、红砖、木材、水暖材料、钢材等，已从国外和全国各地陆续运到鞍山。
    第一土建公司、大型、无缝、筑炉、工业管道等工地第一季度所需要的材料，现在已经全部运到工地。今年需要材料最多的是第二土建公司。每天都有成百辆的火车、汽车、大车在运送红砖、木材、碎石、水泥等主要材料，现在已经运完了大部分。
