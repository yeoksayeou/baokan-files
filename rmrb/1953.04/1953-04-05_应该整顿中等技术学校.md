Reader's Letters Summary

    Should Rectify Secondary Technical Schools
    Editor's Note: In the past month and a half, we have received about seventy letters from students in secondary technical schools across the country. These letters reflect many serious chaotic phenomena in the teaching work of many secondary technical schools due to unclear school management guidelines and tasks. This is a very important issue. The period of large-scale national economic construction has arrived, and the shortage of secondary technical personnel is becoming more serious. In order to train and cultivate a large number of intermediate and junior technical personnel, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Rectifying and Developing Secondary Technical Education" at the end of March last year; however, judging from these readers' letters, there are still many secondary technical schools that have not conscientiously implemented the spirit of the central instructions in terms of school management guidelines and teaching work, which is bound to cause adverse effects. Cultivating technical personnel is a necessary condition for national economic construction, and training and cultivating a large number of secondary technical personnel is particularly important. Now we are publishing a selection of letters below, and we suggest that the Central Ministry of Education and relevant business departments pay attention to this issue.
    
    The Daye Iron and Steel Industry School has Unclear Management Guidelines
    A student from Daye Iron and Steel Industry School writes: The Daye Iron and Steel Industry School was established in September 1951. The school's management guidelines are unclear, and the teaching work is unplanned, causing serious chaotic phenomena in the school's work. The school enrolled a large number of students in October 1951. These students had varying levels of education, ranging from elementary school to university level; the students were also of different ages, some as young as sixteen and some as old as forty. Therefore, there will inevitably be many difficulties in teaching work. Therefore, after eight months of political study, last September the school carried out a "major adjustment": some students were transferred to be teachers, some were transferred to be underground recorders in coal mines, some were mobilized to go home, and some were transferred to other places to study; the remaining 414 students were divided into three departments and eight classes (two classes in the mining department, three classes in the mechanical department, and three classes in the metallurgy department) to study. However, after a semester, the school carried out another "major adjustment" in January this year: more than 100 students were transferred to work in other places, and only more than 200 students remained in school; the departmental system was also changed to three regular classes and two preparatory classes. Therefore, students are very skeptical about the future of the school, and some students are afraid of being adjusted again, and they are not at ease in their studies. In addition, the school originally planned to start technical study last year, and transferred five or six engineers and technicians from the production department (Pingxiang Mining Bureau). However, the result was a change of the original plan. Instead of teaching technical courses, they taught ordinary courses such as trigonometry, algebra, geometry, and chemistry. In this way, not only have we still not learned any technology in the past year, but also wasted the country's technical talents.
    
    Serious Chaotic Phenomena in the Teaching Work of Hunan Jinye Senior Commercial Technical School
    Two students from Hunan Jinye Senior Commercial Technical School write: We are students in the first class of the accounting and statistics department (three-year system) of Hunan Jinye Senior Commercial Technical School, and we entered the school in the spring of 1951. The school was originally led by the Hunan Provincial Finance and Economic Commission, and the teaching was very chaotic. For example, in the first semester of our class, in addition to general courses, there was only one professional course, general bookkeeping. In the second semester, in addition to continuing to study general bookkeeping, we added two more courses, accounting tutorials and government accounting; government accounting was stopped midway through the semester because the content of the teaching materials was not practical and the students had opinions. In the third semester, some new courses were added, but some had no textbooks, some teachers were often absent, and some were stopped midway, so the students gained very little. Two weeks after the start of the fourth semester, all teachers, students, and workers were transferred to participate in the renovation of the South Dongting Lake project according to the instructions of the Provincial Finance and Economic Commission, and did not return to school until the end of February this year. On March 9th this year, the school decided to officially start classes, but the teaching courses have not yet been determined, so a three-day timetable was arranged temporarily, with two classes every day. This semester, our school has been taken over by the Provincial Cooperative Business Administration, and the students have to learn cooperative business again, and a lot of what they learned in the past is useless. The students are very uneasy, and everyone hopes that our school will quickly change this chaotic state, so as to truly shoulder the task of training intermediate professional cadres.
    
    Some Students in Hangzhou Civil Engineering School Changed Majors Three or Four Times in Three Years
    A student from Hangzhou Civil Engineering School writes: The teaching work in our school is very chaotic, and students are repeatedly transferred to change majors, which affects the learning effect. For example, the students in the junior class of the architecture department will graduate this summer. However, this class was the "Road Department" last semester, and it was changed to the architecture department this semester. And this class was formed by merging the civil engineering departments of the former Hangzhou Senior Industrial School and Wenzhou Senior Industrial School. Some of the students were studying surveying before the merger. Therefore, some of us have studied three majors in three years, and some have even studied four majors. Although surveying, roads, architecture, and civil engineering all belong to civil engineering, the things learned in each major are very different. Students have learned some very superficial knowledge in each major, but they are not specialized in any one aspect of technology, which makes it difficult to apply to the intermediate technical personnel that the country urgently needs.

### 应该整顿中等技术学校

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该整顿中等技术学校
    编者按：最近一个半月来，我们收到各地中等技术学校学生来信约七十件。在这些来信中反映了目前许多中等技术学校由于办学方针和任务不明确，造成学校教学工作中的许多严重混乱现象。这是一个非常重要的问题。国家大规模的经济建设时期已经来到了，中等技术人材缺乏的情况愈加严重。为了大量地训练与培养中级和初级技术人材，中央人民政府政务院在去年三月底即发布了“关于整顿和发展中等技术教育的指示”；但从这些读者来信看，目前还有不少中等技术学校在办学方针和教学工作等方面没有认真贯彻中央指示的精神，这势必会引起不良的效果。培养技术人材是国家经济建设的必要条件，而大量地训练和培养中等技术人材尤为重要。现在选登一部分来信在下面，建议中央教育部和有关业务部门重视这个问题。
    大冶钢铁工业学校办学方针不明确
    大冶钢铁工业学校一学生来信：大冶钢铁工业学校在一九五一年九月成立，该校办学方针不明确，教学工作无计划，造成学校工作中的严重混乱现象。该校在一九五一年十月招来大批学生。这些学生文化程度不一，从初小程度到大学程度都有；学生年龄也不等，小的才十六岁，大的有四十岁。这样，在教学工作中必然会有很多困难。因此，经过八个月的政治学习后，去年九月校方来了个“大调整”：有的同学调去当教员，有的调去当煤矿井下记录员，有的动员回家，有的调到其它地方去学习；剩下的四百十四个同学，分在三个科八个班（采矿科二班，机械科三班，冶金科三班）学习。但过了一学期，今年一月校方又来了个“大调整”：有一百多个同学被调到其它地方工作去了，留校学习的只有二百多人；科制也改分为正科三班、预科二班。因此，同学们对学校前途很怀疑，有的同学生怕再调整，学习很不安心。此外，校方原计划去年开始技术学习，从生产部门（萍乡矿务局）调来工程师、技术员等五、六名。但结果却改变原计划，不叫上技术课，却叫上三角、代数、几何、化学之类的普通课程。这样不但一年来我们仍旧学不到技术，也浪费国家的技术人才。
    湖南进业高级商业技术学校教学工作中有严重混乱现象
    湖南省进业高级商业技术学校两个学生来信：我们是湖南省进业高级商业技术学校会统科（三年制）第一班的学生，一九五一年春季入校。该校原由湖南省财政经济委员会领导，教学方面非常混乱。如我班第一学期除普通课程外，只有通用簿记一门专业课。第二学期除继续学习通用簿记外，另增加会计学教程和政府会计两门课；政府会计因教材内容不合实用，同学们有意见，校方在学期中途决议停开。到第三学期新增加了一些课程，但有的无教本，有的老师常缺课，有的中途停开，同学们收获很小。第四学期开课两周，全校师生、工友就奉省财委指示被抽调去参加整修南洞庭湖工程，直到今年二月底才返校。今年三月九日，学校决定正式开课，但教学课程还没确定，就临时按排了三天的课程表，每天上两节课。这学期，我们学校改由省合作事业管理局领导了，同学们又得改学合作业务，过去学的一些东西很多是没用了。同学们思想很不安，大家希望我校迅速改变这种混乱状态，以便真正负起培养中等专业干部的任务来。
    杭州土木工程学校有些学生三年中改了三四次学科
    杭州土木工程学校一学生来信：我们学校教学工作很混乱，学生一再被调改科，影响学习效果。如建筑科三年级下学期这一班学生，今年暑假就要毕业了。但这一班学生上学期为“道路科”，这学期又改为建筑科。而这一班是由原杭州高级工业学校及温州高级工业学校的土木科合并组成的，有一部分同学在合并前是学测量的，因此我们在三年中有的读了三个科，有的甚至四个科。虽然测量、道路、建筑、土木等四科都属于土木工程，但各科所学的东西有很多是不同的。同学们在各科上都学了些极肤浅的知识，但那一方面的技术都不专，这就很难实用于国家目前迫切需要的中级技术人材。
