Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Since the Sixth National Labor Congress, the ranks of the Chinese working class have grown unprecedentedly, and their political consciousness has been elevated to an unprecedented level. Now, workers across the country are basically organized, and the mass organization of the working class—the trade union—has become a strong social pillar of the Chinese people's democratic power. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the total number of employees nationwide has reached more than 15 million, an increase of 2 million compared to the 13 million in 1951. Now, workers across the country are basically organized. At the time of the Sixth National Labor Congress, the total number of trade union members and other organized workers was only 2.83 million, but now trade union membership alone has reached 10.2 million, an increase of about four times. The expansion of trade union organizations in 1952 was rapid. In 1951, there were only 7.29 million trade union members nationwide, but by the end of 1952, the number had increased to 10.2 million. This figure shows that the class consciousness of Chinese workers has greatly improved. In addition to the establishment of trade union organizations at all levels in the six major administrative regions, 23 national committees of industrial trade unions have also been established (including five preparatory committees and eight working committees). Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, these trade union organizations have united, organized, and educated the working class of New China, enabling the Chinese working class to play a significant role in the restoration and transformation of the national economy and in the great cause of building the motherland.

Chinese workers have enhanced their class consciousness within the trade union organizations. In the four years since liberation, Chinese workers have received communist education as well as education on policies and current affairs, and have been tempered in the great movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. According to incomplete statistics, 32 workers' political schools, 64 spare-time political schools, 94 political training courses, and three night party schools have been opened nationwide. More than 1,464,000 workers have undergone training.

Due to the increased political consciousness of Chinese workers, they have contributed their infinite wisdom and strength in restoring and building the motherland, and many outstanding individuals among them have become glorious members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. In the Northeast region, the number of Party members of worker origin was 80,000 in 1949, and it increased to 130,000 in 1952, an increase of about 61 percent. Nationwide, the number increased by 90,000 in 1952 compared to 1951. Now, there are 450,000 communist party members and 650,000 Youth League members of worker origin nationwide, meaning that almost one in fourteen workers is a member of the CCP or the Youth League. There are now more than 223,200 labor models in factories and mines across the country. Many of these labor models are members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Youth League. For example, nationally renowned labor models Su Changyou, Ma Liuhai, Ma Wanshui, Zhang Mingshan, Lu Agou, and Sun Xiaoju are all members of the Chinese Communist Party. Hao Jianxiu, the creator of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, is an outstanding member of the Youth League and has been commended by the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

    中国工人阶级队伍空前壮大
    工会组织迅速扩大会员达一千零二十万阶级觉悟提高大批优秀工人入党入团
    【新华社二十三日讯】自第六次全国劳动大会以来，中国工人阶级的队伍已空前壮大，政治觉悟已空前提高。现在全国工人已基本上组织起来，工人阶级的群众组织——工会已成为中国人民民主政权的坚强的社会支柱。据全国总工会统计，全国职工总数已达到一千五百多万，比一九五一年时的一千三百多万增加了两百万。现在全国工人已基本上组织起来，第六次全国劳动大会时工会会员和其他有组织的工人一共才二百八十三万，现在只工会会员已有一千零二十万，增加到四倍左右。一九五二年一年中工会组织的扩大是迅速的。一九五一年全国工会会员只有七百二十九万，到一九五二年底就增加到一千零二十万。这一数字说明我国工人的阶级觉悟，已有很大的提高。全国除六大行政区建立了各级地方工会组织外，还建立了二十三个产业工会全国委员会（其中有五个筹备委员会，八个工作委员会）。这些工会组织，在中国共产党和中华全国总工会的领导下，团结、组织和教育新中国的工人阶级使中国工人阶级在恢复和改造国家经济中，在建设祖国的伟大事业中，都起了重大的作用。
    中国工人已在工会组织中提高了自己的阶级觉悟。解放四年多来，中国工人受到了共产主义的教育以及政策和时事教育，并在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”和“五反”等伟大的运动中受到了锻炼。据不完全的统计，全国已先后开办了三十二个工人政治学校、六十四个业余政治学校、九十四个政治训练班、三个夜党校。经过学习的工人已有一百四十六万四千多人。
    由于中国工人的政治觉悟提高，在恢复和建设祖国中贡献了他们的无穷智慧和力量，因而他们中的很多优秀人物已成为光荣的中国共产党党员和中国新民主主义青年团团员。在东北地区，一九四九年工人成份的党员是八万人，到一九五二年已增加到十三万人，增加了百分之六十一左右。在全国，一九五二年就比一九五一年增加了九万。现在，全国已有工人成份的共产党员四十五万，青年团员六十五万，差不多每十四个工人当中就有一个中共党员或青年团员。现在全国各工厂矿山已有二十二万三千二百多个劳动模范。这些劳动模范中有很多是中国共产党党员和青年团团员。如全国著名的劳动模范苏长有、马六孩、马万水、张明山、陆阿狗、孙孝菊等都是中国共产党的党员。郝建秀工作法的创造者郝建秀就是一个优秀的青年团团员，曾受到中国新民主主义青年团的表扬。
