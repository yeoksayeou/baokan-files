The CCP Wuxiang County Committee Starts with Inspecting Production and Solving Spring Plowing Problems to Correct the Deviation of Blindly Establishing Agricultural Production Cooperatives

The Wuxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province, starting with inspecting production conditions and helping the masses solve spring plowing production problems, corrected the blind and rash advance deviation in developing agricultural production cooperatives. After inspection and rectification of some blindly developed agricultural production cooperatives, the members have settled down and begun spring plowing production.

Since the autumn of last year, Wuxiang County has seen a deviation of blindly developing agricultural production cooperatives regardless of actual conditions. The eight new cooperatives established in eight villages including Yaozhuang and Doujianao were all formed by district and village cadres who, in pursuit of "village-wide collectivization," forcibly combined mutual aid teams scattered in several natural villages. Some natural villages are three or four miles apart, the land is scattered, and the members had no production ties in the past. After the establishment of cooperatives, there were many problems and it was difficult to carry out unified management. The two cooperatives in Donggou and Songzhuang villages were established by mobilizing farmers to sign up generally through mass meetings. These cooperatives were just empty shells and could not carry out collective production at all. The cooperatives in six villages including Shibi and Xihedi were also put together artificially. Draft animals were owned by the cooperative, and fertilizers had been collectively delivered to the fields, but the members' thinking was chaotic and their emotions were turbulent. The above phenomena seriously affected the current spring plowing production.

After the Wuxiang County Committee and the County People's Government discovered these deviations, they immediately strengthened the cadre force leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In mid-February, they convened a joint meeting of district party committee secretaries and district heads to study documents related to the agricultural production cooperation movement, and decided to start by inspecting and summarizing the production situation of these cooperatives in the first quarter and helping the members solve the immediate problems of spring plowing production, stabilizing the members' production mood, and rectifying these cooperatives. After the meeting, fourteen county and district cadres were selected to go deep into twenty-six cooperatives with more problems, such as Shibi, to conduct typical inspections and solve specific problems, in order to summarize experience and guide the entire county. They first led the members to inspect the production situation in the first quarter, so that everyone saw the harm of blindly establishing cooperatives to production, and then took the following measures to rectify these cooperatives. For those cooperatives that were actually just empty shells, the conditions were explained to the masses, and the dissolution was formally announced. For those cooperatives that forcibly combined members of mutual aid teams from several natural villages, the original mutual aid teams were restored based on specific circumstances and the members' wishes, or small cooperatives were established with one natural village as the main body and absorbing other members who were willing and able to participate. For those members who were unwilling to join the cooperative or had concerns after joining, they were kindly advised to withdraw from the cooperative. For those cooperatives that had already valued draft cattle and put them into the cooperative, and the fertilizer had already been delivered to the fields but could not be stopped, when persuading the masses to stop, the remaining problems were carefully handled on the principle of not affecting production.

After solving the problems of the agricultural production cooperatives, the leadership immediately began to rectify the mutual aid teams, mobilized farmers who had withdrawn from the cooperatives to participate in the mutual aid teams, and helped each team make plans and carry out spring plowing production.

    中共武乡县委从检查生产和解决春耕问题入手
    纠正盲目建立农业生产合作社的偏向
    中共山西省武乡县委会从检查生产情况、帮助群众解决春耕生产问题入手，纠正发展农业生产合作社的盲目冒进偏向。一些盲目发展起来的农业生产合作社经过检查整顿后，社员们已安心开始春耕生产。
    去年秋后，武乡县发生了不顾实际条件盲目发展农业生产合作社的偏向。姚庄、都家堖等八个村新建立的八个合作社，都是区、村干部为了追求“全村合作化”，而把分散在几个自然村中的互助组硬凑起来的。有的自然村相距三、四里，土地分散，社员们过去在生产上没有联系，建立合作社后，问题很多，难于进行统一经营。东沟、嵩庄两村的两个合作社是用开群众大会的方式，鼓动农民普遍报名建立起来的。这种合作社只有一个空架子，根本不能集体生产。石壁、西河底等六村的合作社也是编起来的，耕畜都归了社，肥料也已集体送到地里，但社员思想混乱，情绪动荡。以上这些现象，严重地影响了当前的春耕生产。
    武乡县委和县人民政府发现了这些偏向以后，立即加强了领导互助合作运动的干部力量，并于二月中旬召开了各区区委书记、区长联席会议，学习了有关农业生产合作运动的文件，决定从检查总结这些合作社的第一季度的生产情况，帮助社员解决眼前春耕生产问题入手，安定社员生产情绪，整顿这些合作社。会后，抽出十四个县、区干部，深入石壁等问题较多的二十六个合作社，进行典型检查，具体解决问题，以便总结经验，指导全县。他们先领导社员检查第一季度的生产情况，使大家看到了盲目建社对于生产的危害，然后采取以下办法，整顿这些合作社。对那些实际上只有一付空架子的合作社，向群众讲清条件，正式宣布解散。对那些把几个自然村的互助组员硬凑起来的社，根据具体情况和社员自愿，或恢复原有的互助组，或以一个自然村为主，吸收自愿和可能参加的其他社员，建立小的合作社。对于那些不自愿入社或入社后有顾虑的社员，善意地劝其出社。对于已把耕牛作价入社，肥料已经送到地里但又不能不停办的社，在说服群众停办时，再以不影响生产为原则，慎重地处理遗留问题。
    解决了农业生产合作社的问题以后，领导方面随即着手整顿互助组，发动退出合作社的农民参加互助组，并帮助各组订出计划，开展春耕生产。
