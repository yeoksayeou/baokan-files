Editor's Note: In mid-January, the editorial department of this newspaper invited history teachers from five middle schools in Beijing to hold a symposium to discuss the problems in the book "Advanced Middle School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1). This article is based on the results of the discussion.

We are middle school teachers in Beijing. We use Song Yunbin's "Advanced Middle School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1) as a textbook in our history teaching. However, we, and many teachers in schools we know of, do not teach entirely according to this textbook. The reason is that this textbook has too many shortcomings.

This textbook was segmented by Song Yunbin from his "A Century of Modern Chinese History." In 1949, there was a textbook shortage in middle schools. The old ones were no longer suitable, and new ones had not been compiled. Therefore, someone sought Song Yunbin's opinion on adapting the first part of his "A Century of Modern Chinese History" into "Advanced Middle School Modern Chinese History," and he agreed. This book was later recommended by the Textbook Compilation and Examination Committee of the North China People's Government Education Department as being "more suitable for teaching," so it was used as a textbook. At that time, this textbook was indeed more suitable for teaching compared to the old textbooks. However, today, such a textbook is simply too out of line with the requirements, because it has many problems in terms of political ideology, scientific systematicness, arrangement, and the author's writing attitude. Below, we will put forward some superficial opinions from these aspects for the reference of textbook editors and review organs.

Modern Chinese history is, on the one hand, a history of international capitalism and imperialism colluding with domestic feudal and comprador forces to invade and oppress the Chinese people; on the other hand, it is a history of the Chinese people's struggle against the aggression of the powers and against domestic reactionary rule. From the Opium War onwards, the Chinese people and the reactionary rulers took diametrically opposed paths. If the writing of a modern history textbook does not grasp these two main historical threads, it will inevitably fail to do as Kairov said in his book "Pedagogy," "The history course can enable students to understand the basic laws of human social life and reveal the essence of the historical movement as seen as class struggle." However, the author of this textbook did not handle this point properly.

The first thing we want to point out is that this textbook describes the Chinese people's heroic struggles over the past century very weakly. In the textbook, the author generally lacks vivid, prominent, and lively narratives of the people's struggle life, but uses too much space to render the absurd and shamelessness within the ruling class. For example, when talking about the Northern Warlords, 2,829 words were used to introduce the "evolution of political parties and the change of cabinets," which is actually just the infighting of those bureaucratic and political groups for power and gain, not the main aspect of history, and does not need to be described too much. On the contrary, in the chapter "Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895," the author only used 278 words when narrating the resistance of the Taiwanese people after the cession of Taiwan. Such a vivid historical fact of the Chinese people's heroic and unyielding struggle against Japan was thus lightly passed over. There are many similar examples of overemphasizing the dark side and ignoring the bright side. The result is that students only feel that history is a mess, cannot see who is the real master of history, and even less see how the Chinese people completed different historical tasks at different times and to different degrees. From the perspective of political and ideological education, this is a major shortcoming.

The author's thinking is also unclear in certain places regarding the introduction and analysis of historical figures. For example, Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei played very different roles in history and should never be regarded as equal. We should introduce Sun Yat-sen more, but the author focuses on Kang Youwei. When introducing Kang Youwei, the author outlined his life, wrote about his education, the influence of his grandfather on him, the influence of his teacher Zhu Jiujiang on him, and his ideological system. However, when introducing Sun Yat-sen, it only said that he and Kang Youwei were both from Guangdong, but did not mention which part of Guangdong; it only said that he was from a rich peasant family, but did not mention his family situation and his childhood life; it only said that he studied in a missionary school and studied medicine, but did not mention what ideological influence he received, and even less mentioned his own ideological system; it did not even mention Sun Yat-sen's alias, Yixian. Is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's greatness not as good as Kang Youwei's? We believe that such a writing method that reverses the importance is not just a shortcoming, but should be said to be a mistake, according to the strict requirements that textbooks should have. In addition, in the chapter "Hundred Days' Reform," the author gave such a commendation when narrating the six gentlemen's generous sacrifice: "It played an encouraging and exemplary role for the countless revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed generously later." In addition, in the chapter "Xinhai Revolution," the author gave such a criticism to those martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution: "The enthusiasm and sacrificial spirit of the participants in these revolutionary activities are commendable, but the methods they adopted are not worth learning from." We believe that the latter criticism is very correct, but when this is linked to the previous praise of the six gentlemen, the points of view before and after are somewhat contradictory. Just imagine, even the sacrifices of the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution are not worth learning from, why can the sacrifices of the six gentlemen of the reform movement be "exemplary" instead?

There are many historical errors in this history textbook. Here we will only give one example: On page 38, the author said: "In 1844 (Daoguang 24th year), Hong Xiuquan and Feng Yunshan set up a secret agency in Zijing Mountain on the west side of PengHua Mountain, between Guiping and Wuxuan counties in Guangxi. ... In 1850 (Daoguang 30th year), charcoal workers in Guiping County resisted the government's extortion, causing a major disturbance. Hong Xiuquan took the opportunity to launch an uprising in Jintian Village, Guiping County. ... At that time, Emperor Xianfeng (Emperor Wenzong of Qing) had just ascended the throne and sent GuYuan's governor Xiang Rong and Yunnan's governor Zhang Bilu to lead troops to attack. The Qing army could not win, and Zhang Bilu was killed in battle. In the spring of 1851 (Xianfeng 1st year), the Taiping army occupied Guixian County, crossed the Xun River, and took Wuxuan and Xiang counties, and captured Yong'an Prefecture (now Mengshan County), and established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom."

The above excerpt, less than five hundred words, has six historical errors: 1. Hong Xiuquan and Feng Yunshan did not set up a secret agency in Zijing Mountain in 1844, but in 1847. 1844 was the year when Hong and Feng first entered Guangxi. In the winter of this year, the two separated, and Hong Xiuquan returned to Guangdong, and did not go to Zijing Mountain at all; between 1845 and 1846, Feng Yunshan began to enter Zijing Mountain to teach students, but at this time Hong Xiuquan was in his hometown; in the summer of 1847, Hong Xiuquan entered Guangxi again, and met Feng Yunshan again in Zijing Mountain. Obviously, the author made a mistake in time here. 2. The "PengHua Mountain" mentioned in the text should be "Peng'ai Mountain". PengHua Mountain is a mountain on the border of Guiping and Pingnan, not Peng'ai Mountain in the Zijing Mountain range on the border of Guiping and Wuxuan. Here, the author made a mistake in the location. 3. Although there were different views on the date of the Jintian Uprising in the past, scholars have now verified that it was on January 11, 1851, which has long been a conclusion; however, when the author re-published this textbook in July 1952, he still said it was 1850, which is too inappropriate. 4. After Zhang Bilu received the order from the Manchu Qing government, he led the Qian army, the Wan army twice, and 2,200 Green Standard Army soldiers, entered Guangxi from Guizhou, and died of illness in Xunzhou before going to the battlefield. How can it be said that he was "killed in battle"? 5. Moreover, Zhang Bilu is the former Yunnan governor, and the author did not add the word "former", which is also wrong. 6. The word "spring" in "spring of 1851" in this paragraph is also incorrect. According to the Taiping Army abandoning the DaHuangJiang River Estuary of Guiping in February of the first year of Xianfeng (1851) and entering the eastern village of Wuxuan, they entered the territory of Xiangzhou in April. Recruited the masses of the God Worshipping Society from Wu and Xiang, and still turned back to Jintian, Zijing Mountain, and Xinxu in Guiping County. In August, they broke through from Xinxu and went to Pingnan, defeated the Qing general Xiang Rong's army, and then went through Teng County, and began to besiege Yong'an on the first day of the leap August. How many months does the "spring" mentioned here include? Can April, August, and leap August all be regarded as "spring of 1851"?

In terms of the arrangement of this book, we feel that it is: the focus is not clear, the system is chaotic, and the outline is not clear.

First, the focus is not clear. The author did not elaborate on some places that should be emphasized. For example, when narrating the impact of the Opium War, he did not explain that the Opium War led China onto the road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism from the changes in domestic economic relations, political relations, class relations, and ethnic relations; when talking about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, he did not point out what the differences were between this peasant war and the previous peasant wars, and through these to analyze how the Chinese people completed different historical tasks in different historical eras; when introducing historical figures such as Hong Xiuquan and Li Xiucheng, he did not analyze why these people were great and where they were great from the perspective of social development; and he did not criticize the progressive limitations of their class origin and the era they were in, and pointed out where the limitations were. On the contrary, some places that should not be emphasized were emphasized, such as when introducing Kang Youwei, a large section of "Zhang Sanshi", "Tong Santong", "Jinwen School", "Guwen School", "scholars", "neo-Confucianists", etc. were pulled out, making the students dizzy and the teachers feeling difficult to explain, because these are all specialized problems, which cannot be explained in a few tens of minutes of class, nor can students understand them by themselves outside of class. For example, when introducing the Boxers, starting from the gods they worshipped: Hongjun Patriarch, Guan Gong, Sun Wukong, Huang Tianba, and directly talking about their practice of "Qing Gong" and "Hun Gong", and what is called "Qing Gong" and what is called "Hun Gong", we believe that it is only harmful and not beneficial for students to remember the names of Hongjun Patriarch and so on, and to remember these superstitious facts such as "flying to heaven in a hundred days", so they can all be simplified.

Secondly, the system of arrangement. For example, "Westernization Movement", according to the order of historical years, should be placed before "Sino-Japanese War", but the author put it after "Sino-Japanese War" and next to "Hundred Days' Reform". In this way, we cannot see the laws of social development clearly. For example, like Chapter 5, Section 1, "The Powers' Competition and Struggle in China", and Section 2, "The Powers' Economic Aggression against China and its Impact", we believe that the order of these two sections is best reversed, first talk about Section 2, then talk about Section 1, so that the context is more consistent, and can also explain such a problem - the contradiction of the economic interests of the powers in China finally manifested in political conflicts.

In terms of outline, the whole book, in addition to the division of large chapters, does not have more detailed subheadings, no maps, no statistical tables, and no other physical photos.

In addition, the beginning and ending of paragraphs do not take into account the difficulties of actual teaching. Some places are as long as thirteen or fourteen pages, such as Section 2 of Chapter 1; some places are as short as two pages, such as Section 4 of Chapter 1. How much time does it take to talk about long places? How much time does it take to talk about short places? If the long one cannot be finished in one hour, where does it end? These are very important issues for textbook writing, and the author did not consider them.

Finally, it should be pointed out that the author's writing attitude is very unserious. In many places, mainly due to the author's impractical and irresponsible work style, political errors and factual errors have been caused. For example, the title of Section 1 of Chapter 1 is: "Domestic and Foreign Situation Before the Opium War", but the content does not analyze the domestic situation. This is a major political oversight. When narrating the fact that Britain's outward aggression was caused by the development of capitalism, the author said: "Since Britain accounts for the first place in the trade with China, the task of opening the door of China naturally falls on it." The wording of "task" here is extremely inappropriate. Does it mean that Britain's aggression against China is to complete a "historical task"? According to this, isn't it destined that China should be invaded by Britain? For example, in Section 1 of Chapter 1, there are the following two sentences: "At that time, the general public vaguely felt that this new force of capitalist countries, the exchange relationship between industrial products and agricultural products, would affect our self-sufficient and leisurely life..." It is inappropriate to use the word "leisurely" here casually. At that time, the broad masses of working people were not living a so-called leisurely life. The only people who lived a leisurely life were those parasites who lived by exploitation.

In terms of chronology, it is even more chaotic. Many places use the solar calendar, many places use the lunar calendar, and some places use a mixture of solar and lunar calendars, such as when narrating the Eight-Power Allied Forces, the solar calendar is used when the Allied Forces captured Tianjin on July 14, and the lunar calendar is used again when they invaded Beijing on July 20; some places use the Emperor's era name, such as the first and second lines on page 144: "In the first month of the second year of Xuantong (1910), all representatives gathered in Beijing..."; some places use the sexagenary cycle, such as the ninth and tenth lines on page 139: "In the twelfth month of the Gengzi year, an edict for reform was issued, and in the third month of the Xin Chou year, the 'Office of the Superintendent of Government Affairs' was ordered to be established..."; some places use the AD chronology, such as the ninth line on page 55: "In 1860 (the tenth year of Xianfeng), Senggelinqin was ordered to be responsible for suppressing the Nian Rebellion..."; some places use all AD, sexagenary cycle, and Emperor's era names, such as the first line on page 150: "In the autumn of 1905 (the 31st year of Guangxu Yisi), Sun Yat-sen returned to Japan from Europe..."; some places use the Republican era name, such as the fourth line on page 191: "The opening ceremony was held on February 18, the third year of the Republic of China...".

According to what has been said above, it can be seen how much difficulty this textbook used today brings to teachers and students, and how eagerly teachers and students are looking forward to having a good history textbook. Therefore, we hope that the editors can widely collect opinions and rewrite this textbook; we hope even more that the People's Education Publishing House authorities can attach importance to our opinions, strengthen the allocation of cadres, and compile good textbooks with political content, scientific accuracy, strict systematicness, unified style, lively language, and attached various charts and tables, which can meet the actual teaching needs as soon as possible.

    我们对于“高级中学本国近代史”（上册）的意见
    编者按：一月中旬，本报编辑部曾邀请北京市五个中学历史教师举行座谈会，讨论“高级中学本国近代史”（上册）一书中的问题。本文就是根据讨论结果写出来的。
    谢承仁　郭柏年  洪源  徐建竹  陈梅竹
    我们是北京市的中学教师。我们在历史教学中采用宋云彬编的“高级中学本国近代史”（上册）作为教科书。但是，我们以及我们所知道的好多学校的教师，都没有完全根据这个课本讲授。原因是：这课本的缺点太多了。
    这个课本是宋云彬从他所编的“中国近百年史”里分割出来的。一九四九年，那时中学校正闹着教科书荒，旧的不适用了，新的没有编出来。因而有人征求宋云彬的意见，要把他所写的“中国近百年史”前面的一部分改编成为“高级中学本国近代史”，他答应了。这本书后来由华北人民政府教育部教科书编审委员会推荐，认为较“适于教学”，于是就作为课本了。在当时，这个课本比起旧有的课本来，的确是比较适合于教学一些。但是，到了今天，这样的课本就实在太不合乎要求了，因为不论从政治思想性、科学系统性、编排以及从编者的写作态度等各方面来说，它都存在着许多毛病。下面我们就从这几方面提出一些粗浅的意见，供教科书的编者和编审机关参考。
    我国近代史，一方面是一部国际资本主义、帝国主义勾结国内封建、买办势力，侵略和压迫中国人民的历史；另一方面，是中国人民反对列强侵略，反对国内反动统治斗争的历史。从鸦片战争开始，中国人民和反动统治者所走的就是截然不同的两条道路。编写近代史课本，如果不把这两条主要的历史线索抓住，必然不能做到像凯洛夫在他的“教育学”一书中所说的那样，“历史课程能使学生了解人类社会生活底基本规律，并揭露当作阶级斗争看的历史运动的本质。”然而，这课本的编者对这点却处理得并不得当。
    我们首先要指出的是：这本教科书对于中国人民近百年来的前仆后继的英勇斗争，描写得很没有力量。编者在课本中，对于人民的斗争生活，一般都缺乏鲜明、突出、生动的叙述，却把过多的笔墨用来渲染统治阶级内部的荒唐、无耻去了。例如，在讲北洋军阀时，用了二千八百二十九个字的篇幅去介绍“政党的演化与内阁的更迭”，其实这只是那些官僚、政客集团内部争权夺利的纵横捭阖，不是历史的主要方面，不必过多地描写。相反，在“中日甲午战争”一章中，编者在叙述台湾割让后台湾人民的反抗时，却只用了二百七十八个字。这样一段有声有色的中国人民英勇不屈的抗日斗争的史实，就这样被轻轻地交代过去了。类似这样的过分强调黑暗面、忽略光明面的例子是很多的。其结果是使学生只感到历史一团糟，看不出谁是历史的真正主人，更看不出中国人民怎样在不同的时间和不同的程度上来完成不同的历史任务。从政治思想教育方面来说，这是一个很大缺点。
    对于历史人物的介绍和分析，在某些地方也同样表现了编者的思想是不明确的。例如，孙中山和康有为这两个人物在历史上所起的作用是有很大差别的，决不能等量齐观，我们应该多去介绍孙中山才对，可是编者却把重点放在康有为身上了。介绍康有为时，编者概述了他的生平，写出了他所受的教育，他祖父对他的影响，他老师朱九江对他的影响，以及他的思想体系。但在介绍孙中山时，只说他和康有为同是广东人，至于广东什么地方人则只字未提；只说他是富农出身，至于他家里的情况和他幼年的生活也是只字未提；只说他读的是教会学校，学的是医，至于他究竟受了什么思想影响，以及他本人思想体系如何更是只字未提；甚而连孙中山字逸仙都没有说。难道孙中山先生的伟大不如康有为么？像这种轻重倒置的写法，按照对于教科书应有的严格要求来说，我们认为这就不只是一个缺点的问题了，这应当说是一个错误。此外，在“戊戌变法”那一章，编者在叙述六君子的慷慨牺牲时，曾给了这样一句表扬：“对于后来无数革命先烈的慷慨牺牲，起着鼓励与示范的作用”。另外编者在“辛亥革命”那一章，对那些为革命而牺牲的烈士给了这样一段批评：“这些革命活动，参加者的热情及其牺牲精神是可泣可歌的，但他们所采取的方法可不足为训。”我们认为后一个批评是很正确的，不过这和前面表扬六君子的话联系起来看，前后的论点就有些矛盾了。试想，连辛亥革命的烈士的牺牲尚不足为训，为什么改良运动的六君子的牺牲倒反可以“示范”呢？
    在这一历史课本中，史料错误是很多的。这里我们只举一个例子：在第三十八页，编者这样说：“一八四四年（道光二十四年）洪秀全冯云山在广西桂平武宣两县中间的鹏化山西边的紫荆山设立秘密机关。……一八五零年（道光三十年）桂平县烧炭工人反抗官府勒索，引起大风潮，洪秀全就乘机在桂平县金田村起义。……那时候咸丰帝（清文宗）初即位，派固原提督向荣、云南提督张必禄率领军队，前去攻打。清军不能取胜，张必禄阵亡。一八五一年（咸丰元年）春，太平军占领贵县，过浔江，取武宣、象县，陷永安州（今蒙山县），建号太平天国。”
    上面摘引的这一段，不到五百字，史料上的错误就有六处：一、洪秀全、冯云山在紫荆山设立秘密机关不在一八四四年，而是在一八四七年。一八四四年是洪、冯初次入桂之年，这年冬天，两人就分离了，洪秀全回粤，根本未到紫荆山；一八四五年和一八四六年之间，冯云山始入紫荆山宣教授徒，这时洪秀全却正在他的故乡；一八四七年夏天，洪秀全再次入桂，才和冯云山在紫荆山重逢。显然，这里编者把时间弄错了。二、文中所提到的“鹏化山”应该是“鹏隘山”。鹏化山是桂平、平南交界的一个山，不是桂平、武宣交界的紫荆脉中的鹏隘山。这里，编者把地点弄错了。三、金田起义日期过去虽各有不同的说法，但现在已经学者考证，谓在一八五一年一月十一日，早已成为定论；可是，编者在一九五二年七月再版这个课本时，仍然说是一八五零年，这未免太不应该了。四、张必禄奉到满清政府命令后，率领黔军、皖军二起，绿营兵二千二百人，由贵州入广西，师次浔州，就害病而死，并未上战场，怎么说“阵亡”？五、而且张必禄是前云南提督，编者未加“前”字，这也错了。六、这一段里“一八五一年春”的“春”字，也是不对的。按太平军于咸丰元年（一八五一年）二月弃桂平大湟江口入武宣东乡，四月入象州境。招集武、象两地拜上帝会群众，仍折回桂平县金田、紫荆山、新墟一带。八月从新墟突围走平南，大败清将向荣军，遂经藤县，于闰八月初一，开始围攻永安。这里所说的“春”不知包括哪几月？难道可以把四月、八月、闰八月都算是“一八五一年春”么？
    在这本书的编排方面，我们觉得它是：重点不明，系统混乱，眉目不清。
    先说重点不明。有些地方应该着重作些说明的，编者没有这样作。例如，在叙述鸦片战争的影响时，没有从国内经济关系、政治关系、阶级关系、民族关系等各方面的变化，去说明鸦片战争使中国走上了半封建、半殖民地的道路；在讲太平天国时，没有指出这一农民战争和过去的农民战争两者之间有什么不同，通过这些去分析中国人民怎样在不同的历史时代完成不同的历史任务；在介绍洪秀全、李秀成等历史人物时，没有从社会发展的观点去分析这些人之所以伟大，伟大在那里；更没有从他们的阶级出身及所处的时代，去批判他们进步的局限性，指出局限性在那里。相反，有些地方不应该加重的却加重了，如介绍康有为时，拉出了一大段“张三世”、“通三统”、“今文派”、“古文派”、“经学家”、“理学家”等，闹得同学们头昏脑胀，教师们也感觉难讲，因为这都是些专门问题，不是在几十分钟的课堂里所能讲得了的，也不是同学们在课外自己所能看得懂的。又如像介绍义和团时，从他们所奉的神：洪钧老祖、关公、孙行者、黄天霸说起，直说到他们练“清功”、练“浑功”，以及什么叫“清功”，什么叫“浑功”，我们认为同学们记洪钧老祖等这些名字以及记这些“百日飞升”等迷信事实只有害处，没有好处，所以，都是可以简略的。
    再说编排的系统。譬如“洋务运动”，依照历史年代的次序，应当放在“甲午战争”的前面，而编者却把它放在“甲午战争”后面和“戊戌变法”挨在一起了。这样，我们便不能看清楚社会发展的规律。又如像第五章第一节“列强在华的角逐和斗争”，和第二节“列强对华的经济侵略及其影响”，我们认为这两节次序最好颠倒，先讲第二节，后讲第一节，这样脉络比较一贯，而且还能说明这样一个问题——列强在华经济利益的矛盾，终于表现了在政治上的冲突。
    在眉目上，全书除了大的章节划分外，没有更详细的小标题，没有地图，没有统计表，没有其他实物照片。
    此外，段落的起迄没有照顾实际教学的困难，有的地方一长就长到十三、四页，如第一章第二节即是；有的地方一短就短到两页多一点，如第一章第四节即是。到底长的地方需要多少时间讲？短的地方需要多少时间讲？长的一小时讲不完，又到哪里为止？这些对于编写教科书来说是很重要的问题，编者是没有考虑到的。
    最后，应该指出，编者的写作态度是十分不严肃的。有许多地方，主要是由于编者不踏实、不负责任的工作作风，造成了政治上的错误和事实错误。例如第一章第一节，标题是：“鸦片战争前国内外情况”，而内容却并没有分析国内情况。这是一个重大的政治上的疏忽。编者在叙述英国由于资本主义的发展所引起的向外侵略这一事实时，这样说：“各国对华贸易英国既然占第一位，打开中国大门的任务自然落到它身上了。”这里，“任务”两字的提法极端不妥，难道英国侵略中国是来完成“历史任务”么？照这样说，岂不是中国就注定了应该受英国的侵略？又如在第一章第一节有这样两句话：“当时一般人对于资本主义国家的这一种新势力，只是模模糊糊地感觉到工业品和农业品的交换关系会影响到我们的自给自足的安闲生活……”这里随便用“安闲”两字是不恰当的，当时广大的劳动人民并不是过的所谓安闲生活，过安闲生活的只是那些靠剥削为生的寄生者。
    在纪年上，更是杂乱不堪。好多地方用的是阳历，好多地方则用阴历，有的地方阴阳历杂用，如叙述八国联军时，七月十四日联军攻陷天津用的是阳历，七月二十日攻入北京则又用了阴历；还有的地方是用帝王纪年，如第一四四页第一、二行：“宣统二年（一九一零）正月，各代表齐集北京…”；有的地方则用干支纪年，如第一三九页第九、十行：“庚子年的十二月，曾下过变法的诏书，辛丑年三月又命设立‘督办政务处’……”；有的地方又用公元纪年，如第五五页第九行：“一八六零年（咸丰十年），又命僧格林沁负责剿捻……”；有的地方公元、干支、帝王纪年全用，如第一五零页第一行：“一九零五年（光绪三十一年乙巳）秋间，孙中山从欧洲回日本……”；有的地方又用民国纪年，如第一九一页第四行：“民国三年二月十八日举行开会式……”。
    根据上面讲的，可以看出今日所使用的这个课本，给教师们、同学们带来了多么大的困难，而教师们和同学们却又是多么迫切地期望着有一套好的历史教科书。因此，我们希望编者能广泛搜集意见，把这本教科书重新改写一下；我们更希望人民教育出版社当局能够重视我们的意见，加强干部的配备，早日编出有政治内容的、科学性准确的、系统性严密的、体例统一的、文字生动的、附有各项图表的、能够切合实际教学的好课本。
