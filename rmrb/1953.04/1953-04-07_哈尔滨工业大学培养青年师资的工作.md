Harbin Institute of Technology's Work in Training Young Faculty
Chen Kangbai, President of Harbin Institute of Technology

Graduate Students Play an Important Role in Teaching

From the spring of 1950 to the end of 1952, Harbin Institute of Technology enrolled four classes of graduate students, totaling 586 people. They came from universities, research institutes, and industrial departments all over the country. Currently, 151 graduate students are studying Russian, 107 are studying their specialties with Soviet professors, and 52 have completed their specialty studies and are now conducting experimental teaching.

Judging from the examination results of graduate students' professional studies, their academic performance is good. Those who scored 3 (passing) accounted for 14 percent, those who scored 4 (excellent) accounted for 25 percent, and those who scored 5 (most excellent) accounted for 61 percent.

From the graduate students' participation in experimental lectures and teaching administration, it can also be seen that the academic performance of the vast majority of graduate students is good. Students are satisfied with their teaching work. Now, they have become the backbone of teaching various courses in undergraduate, preparatory, and specialized courses, replacing some incompetent teachers.

Graduate students play an important role in the teaching work of short-term faculty training classes and specialized courses at the school. The study period for short-term faculty training classes and specialized courses is very short (one and a half to two years). It is impossible for them to learn Russian first and then study directly with Soviet advisors; they can only study indirectly through the help of graduate students. In addition to participating in the formulation of teaching plans, teaching calendars, teaching outlines, and production internship outlines for training classes and specialized courses, graduate students also give lectures to students in training classes and specialized courses. Soviet advisors prepare graduate students and participate in listening to lectures, quizzes, and exams, and only answer questions for students in training classes and specialized courses when necessary. Therefore, graduate students not only play a key role in training engineers, but also play a bridging role in the teaching work of short-term faculty training classes and specialized courses.

In addition, graduate students also play an important role in the translation of teaching materials, and they have translated many textbooks published in the Soviet Union.

How is the Work of Training Graduate Students Conducted?

We have the following experiences in training graduate students:

(1) Regarding the training of graduate students, we are proceeding based on China's conditions and with reference to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The training targets are existing university lecturers and teaching assistants with professional knowledge and more than three years of teaching experience, or university graduates with particularly excellent grades. The study period is tentatively set at three years. In the first year, they study Russian, and at the end of the year, they are required to basically reach the level of being able to read, listen, speak, and take notes. In the second and third years, each graduate student must conduct professional studies under the direct guidance of a Soviet advisor according to their individual specific plan (including listening to the Soviet advisor's undergraduate courses); in addition, graduate students must also learn how to guide undergraduate students in doing graduation thesis design, conduct experimental teaching, translate books, and engage in scientific research. Judging from the lecture results of our graduate students, this training method is effective.

Secondly, we must not only let each graduate student make up for production internships, course designs, graduation thesis designs, and other work (because they have almost never learned these things before), but also let them earnestly study brand-new professional courses. When they study professional courses, listen to advisor's lectures, give experimental lectures, and learn how to do teaching and research section work, they can widely learn the knowledge that a new type of teacher must possess.

(2) Regarding the entrance examination and study period of graduate students. In the past, the graduate students enrolled in our school were all introduced by higher-level leading organs, and they were accepted as they came, without holding entrance examinations. Therefore, the level of graduate students was uneven. The cultural level of individual graduate students was too low, and they could not continue studying halfway through, and had to extend their study period; this added many difficulties to Soviet advisors and instructors. Therefore, in the future, strict entrance examinations must be held when enrolling graduate students.

According to our school's experience, one year is generally enough for the Russian language study period. After one year of intensive study, graduate students can basically reach the level of being able to read, listen, speak, and take notes; they will not encounter too many difficulties when learning from Soviet advisors. Our school's undergraduate, preparatory, and specialized courses currently have one hundred Russian classes, and there are more than 120 Russian teachers. In order to strengthen the teaching strength of Russian, we are now planning to train a new batch of Russian teachers.

Regarding the professional study period of graduate students. According to our school's experience, the professional study time for graduate students is about two years; as for the training time for teachers of mathematics, physics, chemistry, theoretical mechanics, etc., it can be less than two years. However, the study time for teachers who teach professional courses cannot be less than two years.

(3) Give full play to the strength of Soviet advisors. The work of Soviet advisors is extremely heavy. Each advisor has an average of six to seven graduate students, and some have as many as thirteen or fourteen. Because graduate students not only study their specialties with fixed advisors, but also have to study relevant courses with other advisors. For example, graduate students studying relay protection must also study courses related to power plants and power grids; graduate students studying power plant courses must also study relay protection courses.

Most of the comrades in the Soviet advisor group also undertake undergraduate teaching work. From the formal point of view, this seems to have no direct relationship with the work of training graduate students, but from the actual work, this is an important method of mentoring graduate students. On the one hand, graduate students listen to the undergraduate courses taught by their instructors, and on the other hand, they serve as teaching assistants for the course, helping to correct exercises, helping with course design and production internships, etc., in order to learn the ability to teach the course well. Therefore, the Soviet advisor's teaching of undergraduate courses is an important method of training graduate students.

The experimental teaching of graduate students is not equivalent to normal teaching, because everything is carried out under the guidance of Soviet advisors when graduate students are teaching. Therefore, Soviet advisors listening to lectures is also an important method of training graduate students, which requires Soviet advisors to spend more time.

The work of the teaching and research section is closely related to the work of training graduate students. The time spent by Soviet advisors in our school on lectures accounts for about 40 percent of the total working hours, and the rest of the time is almost entirely invested in tutoring work, so their workload is very heavy (professors at Soviet industrial university research institutes generally only supervise four graduate students, and professors with the help of associate professors supervise at most eight graduate students). Therefore, it is not easy to ask each Soviet advisor to supervise more than 20 graduate students, given our school's specific situation. Because our current conditions are very poor, and even the most basic scientific research equipment is not available. In order to give better play to the strength of the advisors, we must reduce their administrative work in the future and let them concentrate on guiding academic research work. We believe that it is more reasonable to require each Soviet advisor group to supervise ten graduate students.

How to Train Graduate Students More Effectively

In order to train more young faculty, we will adopt a key training method in the future, first concentrating on training a group of graduate students with better quality, and then training faculty through them. That is: the graduate students who have completed their professional studies will lecture in separate classes, and the Soviet advisors will be responsible for guidance. On average, each graduate student can lead ten to fifteen people. If the graduate students currently participating in teaching work do not have much transfer, our school's teaching work and the work of training graduate students will not be greatly affected; if the transfer is frequent, it will inevitably lead to an increase or decrease in the number of cadres. This not only affects teaching, but also affects the work of the Soviet advisor group, because this situation will necessarily require them to repeatedly teach a fixed course, and cannot concentrate on training graduate students and faculty. Therefore, delaying the return time of graduate students from other schools is a reasonable way to solve this problem. We require some graduate students from other schools to continue to stay in the school for one to two years to participate in teaching work after their study period expires.

How to improve the work of training graduate students from the existing foundation? Based on our school's experience in the past two years, to improve the work from the existing foundation, the following three issues must be resolved:

First, the issue of production internship contracts. The basic purpose of production internship is to combine theory with practice, and to consolidate the theoretical knowledge that students have gained in their professional studies. If students lack work experience in production internships, they will not know how to apply theoretical knowledge to production practice after graduation. Graduates from old-type universities have almost never done production internships, course designs, and graduation thesis design work, so it is difficult for them to lead production after they arrive at factories.

Production internship also plays a great role in improving the level of teaching work. If teachers do not go to production practice, they will not know the requirements of production for science and technology, nor will they understand the achievements of modern science, and what they teach will lag behind today's technical level of production.

Although we have paid attention to production internship work for more than two years, it has been affected to a certain extent due to insufficient attention and inconsistent understanding of the production department's production internship work. For example: the factory leadership believes that organizing and leading production internship is the responsibility of school teachers, and even believes that students' internships will hinder production, and did not seriously lead this work. To improve this work, it is not enough to rely solely on the school. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the higher-level leading organs must stipulate specific methods and instruct the school and enterprises to sign production internship contracts.

Second, the issue of scientific research contracts. Strengthening the connection between teachers, students, and national economic construction, applying the achievements of science and technology to production practice, and enriching the content of scientific research work with the new achievements obtained in production practice are the central tasks of scientific research work. Therefore, we must strengthen scientific research work in the future, so that all teaching staff have the opportunity to help solve the technical problems in China's economic construction, and at the same time continuously improve the quality of teaching work. With the help and guidance of the Soviet advisor group, our school has established preliminary contacts with factories and mines in scientific research work. It must be pointed out here that the depth of understanding of industrial and production departments on the scientific research work of the school is uneven. Some units actively come to the school and request close cooperation with the school in research work; some units do not pay enough attention to this work and make excuses to shirk responsibility. This shows that the leading comrades of some production units do not understand that scientific research is the main method of improving production. In order to change this situation, we have stipulated the development direction of scientific research work in the draft five-year development plan of Harbin Institute of Technology, and proposed more than 200 research topics, and submitted the requirements for signing scientific research contracts with factories and mines to higher-level leading departments. Third, the issue of enriching books and equipment. For more than two years, the school has done a very poor job in ensuring the supply of teaching books and instruments and equipment. We simply relied on the country to order goods from abroad, and did not check in time afterwards, nor did we contact the relevant departments in time, resulting in the failure to complete the plan; this not only delayed the teaching work, but also caused great difficulties in the work of training graduate students. We know that enriching books and instruments and equipment cannot be achieved in the short term, and we must overcome these difficulties with a revolutionary spirit in the future.

Finally, I want to talk about the issue of degree theses. There are many graduate students in our school who have the potential to be trained, and they can study with Soviet advisors to write degree theses. Some people believe that they should be given the opportunity to do teaching special research work and scientific research work, and try to make reports at the regular meetings held by the school, and then gradually create conditions for them to do graduation theses and thesis defenses (this is an important step in guiding graduate students to do degree theses); those with particularly excellent results can do degree theses. This opinion is correct, and it can push the work of training graduate students forward. Although our country does not yet have these conditions, the educational leadership department should consider this issue.

    哈尔滨工业大学培养青年师资的工作
    哈尔滨工业大学校长　陈康白
    研究生在教学中起了重要作用
    从一九五○年春季到一九五二年年底，哈尔滨工业大学招收过四期研究生，共计五百八十六人。他们来自全国各地的高等学校、研究所和工业部门。现在正在学习俄文的研究生有一百五十一人，随苏联教授进行专业学习的有一百零七人，已完成专业学习、正在进行实验教课的有五十二人。
    从研究生专业学习的考试来看，大家的学习成绩是好的，得三分的（及格）占百分之十四，得四分（优等）的占百分之二十五，得五分的（最优等）占百分之六十一。
    从研究生参加实验讲课和教学行政工作的情况来看，也可以看出绝大多数研究生的学习成绩是好的。同学对他们的教学工作都表示满意。现在，他们已经成为本科、预科和专修科各课程教学的中坚力量，代替了一部分不称职的教师。
    研究生在本校短期师资进修班和专修科的教学工作中起着重要的作用。短期师资进修班和专修科学生的学习年限都是很短的（一年半到两年），他们不可能先学俄文，然后直接跟苏联顾问学习，只能间接地通过研究生的帮助来进行学习。研究生除参加制订进修班和专修科的教学计划、教学日历、教学提纲、生产实习提纲以外，还要给进修班和专修科同学讲课。苏联顾问则给研究生进行预备，并参加听课、测验和考试等工作，必要时才给进修班和专修科同学解答问题。因此，研究生不仅要在培养工程师的工作中起中坚作用，而且要在短期师资进修班和专修科的教学工作中起桥梁作用。
    此外，研究生在翻译教材的工作中也起着重要的作用，他们翻译了苏联出版的许多教科书。
    培养研究生的工作是怎样进行的
    我们在培养研究生方面有以下几点经验：
    （一）关于研究生的培养，我们是根据我国的条件参照苏联的先进经验进行的。培养对象为具有专业知识、参加教学工作三年以上的现有高等学校讲师、助教或是成绩特别优良的大学毕业生。学习期限暂定三年。第一年学习俄文，结束时要求基本上达到能看书、听讲、说话、记笔记的程度。第二年、第三年每个研究生都必须在苏联顾问的直接指导下，按个人的特定计划进行专业学习（包括听苏联顾问讲本科的课程）；此外，研究生还要学习如何指导本科学生做毕业论文设计，进行实验教学，翻译书籍和从事科学研究工作。从我校研究生的讲课成绩来看，这种培养方法是有效的。
    其次，我们不仅要让每个研究生都补做生产实习、课程设计、毕业论文设计等工作（因为他们以前几乎完全没有学过这些东西），还要让他们认真地学习内容崭新的专业课程。他们在学习专业课程、听顾问讲课、实验讲课和学做教研室工作时，就可以广泛地学到一个新型师资所必须具备的知识。
    （二）关于研究生的入学考试和学习年限。过去我校所招收的研究生都是由上级领导机关介绍的，随到随收，没有举行入学考试。因此，研究生的程度是不齐的。个别研究生的文化水平太低，学到半路竟学不下去了，不得不延长学习期限；这就给苏联顾问和指导教师增加了许多困难。所以，今后招收研究生时，必须举行严格的入学考试。
    俄文的学习年限，根据我校的经验，一年的时间大体上是足够的。研究生经过一年的紧张学习，基本上可以达到能够阅读、听讲、说话、记笔记的程度；他们向苏联顾问学习时不会遇到太大的困难。我校本科、预科和专修科现有一百个俄文班，俄文教师有一百二十人以上。为了加强俄文的教学力量，我们现正计划训练一批新的俄文师资。
    关于研究生的专业学习年限。根据我校的经验，研究生的专业学习时间大约需要两年；至于数学、物理、化学、理论力学等师资的培养时间，可以少于两年。但教专业课程的师资，学习时间不能少于两年。
    （三）充分发挥苏联顾问的力量。苏联顾问的工作是极为繁重的。每一顾问平均要带六至七个研究生，多的要带十三、四人。因为研究生不仅按专业向固定的顾问进行学习，还必须向其他顾问学习有关的课程。例如，学继电器保护的研究生，同时还要学习有关发电厂和电力网的课程；学习发电厂课程的研究生，也要学习继电器保护的课程。
    苏联顾问组的同志大部分都担任本科的教学工作。从形式上看，这似乎和培养研究生的工作没有直接关系，但从实际工作上来看，这正是带研究生的一种重要方法。研究生一方面听指导教师所教的本科课程，一方面担任该门课的助教，帮助改习题、帮助进行课程设计和生产实习，等等，以便学习教好这门课的本领。因此，苏联顾问教本科的课程，乃是训练和培养研究生的一种重要方法。
    研究生的实验教学，并不等于正常教学，因为研究生在上课时一切都是在苏联顾问的指导下进行的。所以，苏联顾问听课也是训练研究生的一种重要方法，它要求苏联顾问付出更多的时间。
    教学研究室的工作，是和培养研究生的工作密切关联着的。我校苏联顾问花在讲课上的时间约占工作总时数的百分之四十，其余时间几乎全部投入了辅导工作中，因此他们的工作量是很重的（苏联工业大学研究院的教授一般只带四个研究生，有副教授帮助的教授至多也只带八个研究生）。因此，要求苏联顾问每人带二十多个研究生，从我校的具体情况来看，是不易办到的。因为目前我们的条件很差，甚至连起码的科学研究设备都还没有。为了更好地发挥顾问们的力量，今后我们要减少他们的事务性工作，让他们集中力量指导学术研究工作。我们认为，要求苏联顾问组每人带十个研究生是比较合理的。
    如何更有效地培养研究生
    为了培养更多的青年师资，今后我们将采取重点培养的方法，先集中培养一批质量较好的研究生，然后再通过他们去培养师资。这就是：由现已完成专业学习的研究生分班进行讲授，苏联顾问则担任指导工作。平均每个研究生可以带领十个到十五个人。如果现在参加教学工作的研究生，调动不大，我校教学工作和培养研究生的工作不会受到太大的影响；假若调动频繁，势必在干部条件上产生时增时减的现象。这不仅影响教学，也影响苏联顾问组的工作，因为这种情形势必要求他们重复地教一门固定的课，不能集中力量从事培养研究生和师资的工作。因此，延缓外校研究生的返校时间是解决这个问题的合理办法。我们要求一部分外校研究生在他们学习期满以后，继续留在学校里参加一年到两年的教学工作。
    如何从现有的基础上把培养研究生的工作提高一步？根据我校两年来的经验，要把工作从现有基础上提高一步，必须解决以下三个问题：
    第一，关于生产实习合同问题。生产实习的基本目的，在于使理论和实际结合起来，并巩固同学在专业学习中所获得的理论知识。如果同学缺乏生产实习的工作经验，毕业后就不会懂得如何把理论知识应用到生产实际中去。旧型高等学校的毕业生几乎都没有做过生产实习、课程设计和毕业论文设计工作，因此他们毕业后到了工厂，很难领导生产。
    生产实习对于教学工作水平的提高也有很大的作用。如果教师不到生产实际中去，他就不会知道生产对科学技术的要求，也不会了解现代科学的成就，而他所教的东西也就会落后于今天生产的技术水准。
    两年多来我们虽然注意了生产实习工作，但由于抓得不够紧，以及生产部门对学校生产实习工作的认识不一致，使生产实习受到了一定的影响。例如：工厂领导方面认为，组织和领导生产实习是学校教师的事，甚至认为学生的实习会妨碍生产，没有认真地领导此项工作。要改进这一工作，单单靠学校是不够的，必须根据苏联的先进经验，由上级领导机关规定具体的办法，责成学校和企业部门订立生产实习合同。
    第二，关于科学研究合同问题。加强教师、同学和国家经济建设的联系，把科学技术方面的成就应用到生产实践中去，并将生产实践中所获得的新成果充实科学研究工作的内容，乃是科学研究工作的中心任务。因此，我们今后要加强科学研究工作，使全体教学人员都有机会帮助解决我国经济建设中的技术问题，同时不断提高教学工作的质量。在苏联顾问组的帮助指导下，我校在科学研究工作方面已和工厂、矿山建立了初步的联系。这里必须指出，工业和生产部门对于学校科学研究工作的认识深度是不一的。有的单位主动地来找学校，要求在研究工作方面和学校密切配合起来；有的单位对这一工作是不够重视的，借故推脱。这说明某些生产单位的领导同志不懂得科学研究是提高生产的主要方法。为了改变这种情况，我们曾在哈尔滨工业大学五年发展计划草案中规定了科学研究工作的发展方向，提出了二百多种研究题，向上级领导部门提出了和工厂、矿山订立科学研究合同的要求。第三，关于图书和设备的充实问题。二年多以来学校在保证教学图书和仪器设备的供应方面做得很差。我们单纯依靠国家对外订货，事后又没有及时检查，也没有及时和有关部门联系，结果没有完成计划；既误了教学工作，又使培养研究生的工作遇到了很大困难。我们知道，要充实图书和仪器设备，并不是短期内可以做到的，今后必须用革命的精神来克服这方面的困难。
    最后，我要谈一谈学位论文问题。我校有培养前途的研究生是很多的，可以让他们跟苏联顾问学习作学位论文。有人认为，应该使他们有机会做教学专题研究工作和科学研究工作，并在学校定期召开的会议上试做报告，然后逐渐创造条件，让他们作毕业论文和论文答辩（这是引导研究生作学位论文的重要步骤）；成绩特别优良的，可以做学位论文。这种意见是对的，它可以把培养研究生的工作向前推进一步。目前我国虽然还没有具备这种条件，但教育领导部门对这个问题是应该予以考虑的。
