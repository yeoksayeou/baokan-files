Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: According to a report in the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper: On the 3rd, Japanese business circles held a "National Industrial and Commercial Entrepreneurs' Conference to Promote Sino-Japanese Trade and Overcome the Crisis" in Tokyo. More than 110 representatives from more than 90 groups and companies, including representatives from Sino-Japanese trade promotion conferences in various Japanese prefectures, the All-Japan Small and Medium Industrial Association, and the textile industry, attended the conference.

Various Japanese industrialists and businessmen at the conference expressed their distress under the blows of the American "embargo" policy, and believed that it would be impossible to promote Sino-Japanese trade without breaking through the political pressure from the United States and the Yoshida government. The conference decided that in this Japanese Diet election, they must elect candidates who truly consider the interests of Japanese industrialists and businessmen, regardless of their party affiliation.

The declaration passed by the conference pointed out: "The Japanese economy is in a state of chaos." The declaration demanded that the Yoshida government lift restrictions on Sino-Japanese trade and conduct free trade; adjust relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union; grant freedom to travel abroad; develop peaceful industries without restriction; and improve the lives of the Japanese people.

After the "National Industrial and Commercial Entrepreneurs' Conference to Promote Sino-Japanese Trade and Overcome the Crisis" was held, the "Political Alliance to Promote Sino-Japanese Trade," composed of candidates participating in this general election, was officially registered on the 6th. This group includes candidates from various parties who advocate promoting Sino-Japanese trade. Among them are Communist Party members Karoku Hosokawa and Denichi Kaneiwa; the Labor-Farmer Party's Hisao Kuroda; Toshiaki Wada of the Socialist Party Reconstruction Liaison Council; independents Yoshitaro Hirano and Tokusaburo Awa; and the left-wing Socialist Party's Kei Hoashi, among twenty-nine senatorial and house of representative candidates.

Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese fiscal year 1952 (April 1952 to March 1953) has ended. Official statistics show that Japan's foreign trade declined sharply in the past year.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Finance, Japan's total exports in fiscal year 1952 were only 1.196 billion US dollars, a sharp decrease of 16.1 percent compared to fiscal year 1951; total imports decreased by 1.1 percent compared to fiscal year 1951, totaling 2.1 billion US dollars, resulting in an excess of imports of more than 900 million US dollars, setting a new record for Japan's annual excess of imports since the war. The situation in the last quarter of fiscal year 1952 was particularly bad. From January to March of this year, exports were only 280 million US dollars, a sharp decrease of 21.6 percent compared to the same period in fiscal year 1951; it was also the quarter with the fewest exports in the two fiscal years of 1951 and 1952.

The total amount of export approvals from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry also reflects the sharp decline in Japan's export trade. According to statistics from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the total approved exports in fiscal year 1952 was 1.132 billion US dollars, a decrease of 444 million US dollars from the initial plan in March 1952. The main reason for the plan's failure was the shrinking of the capitalist world market, especially the intensified trade competition between Japan and Britain. In fiscal year 1952, Japan's exports to the sterling area only reached 67.9 percent of the plan, and exports to the free settlement area only reached 53.4 percent of the plan.

The sharp increase in the excess of imports caused by the sharp decline in exports has greatly affected Japan's reliance on US military orders to make up for its foreign exchange deficit. According to statistics from the Bank of Japan, although the foreign exchange balance in fiscal year 1952 showed a "surplus" of 94 million US dollars due to the receipt of 800.1 million US dollars in US military orders, this figure has decreased by 470 million US dollars compared to fiscal year 1951.

    日本全国工商业界举行促进日中贸易大会
    日本官方统计说明一九五二年度日本对外贸易大大衰退
    【新华社十九日讯】据日本“赤旗报”消息：日本全国企业界三日在东京举行了“全国工商业家促进日中贸易突破危机大会”。出席大会的有代表日本全国各县日中贸易促进会议、全日本中小工业协议会和纺织业界等九十多个团体和公司的代表一百一十余人。
    各种不同的日本工商业家在大会上诉述了他们在美国的“禁运”政策打击下的苦闷，并认为不打破美国和吉田政府的政治压力就不可能推进日中贸易。大会决定在这次日本国会选举中一定要把真正考虑日本工商业家利益的候选人选入国会，而不管他们所属的党派是什么。
    大会通过的宣言指出：“日本经济正处于混乱状态。”宣言要求吉田政府撤销对日中贸易的限制，进行自由的贸易；调整日本与中国和苏联之间的关系；给予出国的自由；无限制地发展和平工业，提高日本国民生活。
    在“全国工商业家促进日中贸易突破危机大会”举行之后，由参加这次大选的候选人组成的“促进日中贸易政治同盟”已在六日正式登记成立。参加这一团体的包括各党派主张促进日中贸易的候选人。其中有共产党的细川嘉六、兼岩传一；劳农党的黑田寿男；社会党再建联络会的和田敏明；无党派的平野义太郎、淡德三郎；左派社会党的帆足计等二十九个参议员和众议员候选人。
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：日本一九五二会计年度（一九五二年四月到一九五三年三月）已经结束。官方的统计数字说明，在过去这个年度中，日本的对外贸易大大衰退。
    据大藏省的统计，一九五二年度，日本的出口总额仅有十一亿九千六百万美元，比一九五一年度锐减了百分之十六点一；进口总额比一九五一年度减少百分之一点一，共达二十一亿美元，结果入超九亿多美元，创战后日本每年入超额的新纪录。在一九五二年度中，最后一季度的情况尤其恶劣。从今年一月到三月，出口仅有二亿八千万美元，比一九五一年度同期锐减百分之二十一点六；也是一九五一和一九五二两个年度中出口最少的一个季度。
    通商产业省的批准出口总额同样反映出日本输出贸易急剧减少的情况。通商产业省的统计说，一九五二年度的批准出口总额是十一亿三千二百万美元，比当初一九五二年三月的计划减少四亿四千四百万美元。计划破产的主要原因是资本主义世界市场的缩小，特别是日本和英国的贸易竞争尖锐化。一九五二年度日本对英镑区的出口仅达到计划的百分之六十七点九，对自由结算区域的出口仅达到计划的百分之五十三点四。
    出口锐减所造成的入超激增的情况，大大影响了日本的依赖美国军事订货来弥补外汇赤字的局面。据日本银行的统计，一九五二年度的外汇收支，虽然由于收到了八亿零一百万美元的美军订货而“盈余”了九千四百万美元，但是，这个数字已经比一九五一年度减少了四亿七千万美元。
