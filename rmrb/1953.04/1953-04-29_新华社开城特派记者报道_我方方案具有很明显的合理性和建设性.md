    Xinhua News Agency Kaesong Special Correspondent Reports:
    Our Plan Has Obvious Reasonableness and Constructiveness
        [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 28th] Our special correspondent reports: Since General Nam Il put forward the six-point proposal on solving the issue of repatriation of all prisoners of war, the armistice negotiations have not made progress. The chief representative of the US side only repeated his statement on the 26th and did not try to eliminate the differences between the two sides.

    The highly constructive proposals of Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung have in effect broken the deadlock that has formed over the issue of repatriating prisoners of war due to the US side's obstruction of "voluntary repatriation" for the past year. The armistice negotiations, which had been interrupted for more than six months, resumed on the 26th on the basis of resolving the issue of prisoners of war in two steps. The issue that needs to be resolved at the current meeting is the specific measures to implement this proposal, and General Nam Il's six-point proposal already includes such measures.

    As General Nam Il emphasized on the 27th: "In fact, as long as both sides are determined to work together to solve the problem and achieve a Korean armistice, the actual arrangements for sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral countries will not encounter any insurmountable difficulties." The constructiveness and reasonableness of these six measures are very obvious! However, Harrison put them aside, believing that they are "neither reasonable nor constructive."

    General Nam Il suggested that the nominated neutral country should be a neutral country agreed upon through consultations between the two sides. This suggestion is obviously fair and reasonable. However, Harrison unilaterally insisted that Switzerland should be selected as such a neutral country, although the Korean-Chinese side had already pointed out to him that Switzerland is "obviously unsuitable." The US side once nominated Switzerland to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission composed of two neutral countries nominated by each side.

    It is very obvious that it takes six months to explain to the prisoners of war who have undergone nearly three years of Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee's special agents' terror, killings, and forced "screening" in prisoner-of-war camps to eliminate their fears.

    Looking at the prisoners of war who have been physically and mentally devastated that the Korean-Chinese side received in Panmunjom, it is clear enough to prove the indescribable terror and coercion they suffered in Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and Busan.

    General Nam Il suggested that the remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should be sent to neutral countries so that they can be explained to and eliminate the impressions of bloodshed and violence. This suggestion is also very reasonable.

    He also explained to Harrison that after the six-month period expires, if there are still prisoners of war under the supervision of neutral countries, the handling method should be negotiated and resolved by a higher-level political conference. This treatment does not hinder the political conference from quickly resolving the issues it must resolve. The main thing is to agree on a principle that the political conference will resolve this issue. As for the specific arrangements for submitting this issue to the political conference, it is not difficult to resolve.

    As General Nam Il pointed out, "The trouble with the actual arrangement cannot be used as an excuse to oppose a reasonable solution to the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation."

    The Korean-Chinese side has made obvious concessions in order to eliminate differences in reaching a Korean armistice agreement. So far, Harrison has done nothing constructive other than putting these concessions aside and considering them "neither reasonable nor constructive," while the new suggestions from the Korean-Chinese side have been hailed around the world as peaceful suggestions. The nearly two-year history of armistice negotiations has proven that agreements can only be reached through the efforts of both sides. Now it is time for the US representative to show that they are also willing to eliminate the differences that are hindering the realization of a Korean armistice.

### 新华社开城特派记者报道  我方方案具有很明显的合理性和建设性

    我方方案具有很明显的合理性和建设性
        【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者报道：在南日大将提出了关于解决全部战俘遣返问题的六条方案以后，停战谈判恢复并没有获得进展。美方首席代表只重复他在二十六日的声明，并没有设法消除双方之间的分歧。
    周恩来总理和金日成首相的高度建设性的建议，实际上已打开了一年来由于美方的“自愿遣返”的阻挠而在遣返战俘问题上所形成的僵局。中断了六个多月的停战谈判，已在二十六日在分两个步骤解决战俘问题的基础上复会。目前会议尚需解决的问题便是实施这个建议的具体措施，而南日大将的六条方案已经包括了这样的措施。
    正如南日大将二十七日所强调的：“事实上只要双方决意合力解决问题，实现朝鲜停战，将未予直接遣返的战俘送到中立国的实际安排也不会有任何不可克服的困难。”这六条措施的建设性和合理性是很明显的！但是哈利逊却把它们搁在一边，认为
    “既不合理又没有建设性”。
    南日大将建议：被提名的中立国应该是双方协商同意的一个中立国，这种建议显然是很公平合理的。哈利逊却片面地坚持应选瑞士作为这样一个中立国，虽然朝中方面已经向他指出：瑞士“显然是不适合的”。美方曾经提名瑞士参加由双方各提名两个中立国组成的中立国监察委员会。
    要对经过了差不多三年的国民党和李承晚特务的恐怖、枪杀和战俘营的强迫“甄别”的战俘进行解释，来消除他们的疑惧，就需要六个月的时间，这是很显然的。
    看了朝中方面在板门店所接收的身心受到摧残的战俘，就足以清楚地证明他们在巨济岛、济州岛和釜山所受到的无法形容的恐怖和胁迫。
    南日大将建议：未被直接遣返的其余战俘应该送到中立国家去，以便对他们进行解释，消除这些流血与暴力的印象，这种建议也是十分合理的。
    他还对哈利逊解释说，在六个月期满之后，如尚有在中立国看管之下的战俘，其处理办法应交由高一级的政治会议协商解决，这种处理丝毫不妨碍政治会议迅速解决它所必须解决的问题。主要的事情是同意这样一个原则，即由政治会议解决这个问题。至于将这个问题提交政治会议的具体安排问题，是不难解决的。
    正如南日大将指出的，“实际安排的麻烦是不能作为反对合理解决战俘遣返问题的藉口的”。
    朝中方面为了消除在达成朝鲜停战协定问题上的分歧，已经作了明显的让步。到目前为止，哈利逊除了把这种让步搁置不理，认为是“既不合理又没有建设性”以外，并没有做任何建设性的事，而朝中方面的新建议已得到世界各地的欢呼，认为它是和平的建议。将近两年的停战谈判历史证明，协议只能通过双方的努力达成。现在是要由美方代表来表示一下他们也是愿意消除阻挠实现朝鲜停战的分歧的时候了。
