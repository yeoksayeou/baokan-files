　　Preliminary Achievements and Experiences of the People's Procuratorate Work in the Past Three Years

　　In the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the local people's governments at all levels, the People's Procuratorates at all levels have closely relied on the broad masses and fought against various illegal and undisciplined behaviors, and have achieved preliminary results and experiences, creating conditions for the future development of procuratorial work and the establishment of the people's procuratorial system.
    In the past three years, procuratorial work has closely cooperated with various social reform movements, serving the central tasks. Since 1950, People's Procuratorates at all levels have actively participated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the People's Procuratorates at all levels, in conjunction with public security organs and people's courts, handled a large number of counter-revolutionary cases, and in order to implement the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries and ensure the strict and correct punishment of counter-revolutionary criminals, inspected many counter-revolutionary cases. In East China alone, more than 14,000 cases were inspected. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, procuratorates at all levels went all out to participate in the work of the thrift and inspection committees, playing a considerable role in assisting the "Three-Anti" movement in key departments; in particular, through procuratorial correspondents and complaint boxes, a large amount of materials were provided for the "Three-Anti" movement. The complaint box set up by the Xuzhou Municipal Procuratorate received 7,098 pieces of materials reporting embezzlement and theft during the "Three-Anti" movement. According to statistics from the five provinces and one city in Northwest China and some special and county procuratorates, a total of 1,107 major embezzlers were prosecuted, 1,990 embezzlement cases were reviewed, and the principle of "yes is yes, no is no" was correctly implemented.
    In coordination with the judicial reform movement, the procuratorial work of People's Procuratorates at all levels has been further developed. According to statistics from the East China, Northwest China, Central and South China, and Southwest China Procuratorates, a total of 77,874 cases were accepted in 1952. In particular, the struggle of procuratorates in various regions against illegal arrests, beatings, arbitrary infringements on human rights, and framing of the masses has become an important aspect of the entire struggle against illegal and undisciplined behavior, cracking down on many illegal and undisciplined elements with serious crimes and great popular resentment, and effectively safeguarding the democratic rights of the people. According to statistics from 73 procuratorates at all levels in 1952, a total of 2,736 cases of illegal and undisciplined behavior were directly investigated and handled or participated in the investigation and handling. The procuratorates' struggle against illegal and undisciplined behavior has been warmly supported by the masses, who call the procuratorate a "new organ that can redress grievances for the people." After the Huaiyuan County Procuratorate in Anhui Province handled cases of the county's former vice president of the people's court shielding counter-revolutionaries and district and township cadres illegally detaining and beating farmers, it was warmly supported by the masses. At the people's representative conference at all levels in the county, a resolution was also passed to strengthen the procuratorial work.
    People's Procuratorates in various regions have conducted judicial supervision through accepting mass accusations and inspecting prisons, and have corrected some cases of wrongful arrests, detentions, and judgments by public security organs and courts. From January to March of this year, the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate received more than 400 letters of accusation from the masses, revealing 18 cases of wrongful arrests and detentions caused by illegal and undisciplined behavior. Last year, the Shaanxi Provincial Procuratorate inspected 23 improperly handled cases, released 195 innocent people, and investigated and clarified 9 people who were wrongly sentenced to death and retried them. Last year, when the Xinyang Special District Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate sent people to inspect the Xincai County Prison, they found that two farmers, Liu Ximeng and Liu Jianye, who had been sentenced to death, were crying out for injustice. After in-depth investigation, it was confirmed that this was originally a major wrongful case deliberately framed. Liu Ximeng and Liu Jianye were both hardworking and loyal farmers. In 1950, Liu Li, from the same village as them, died of typhoid fever. Wang Shoudao, a judge of the Xincai County People's Court, colluded with the landlord to falsely accuse them of murdering her. After being tortured, Liu Ximeng and others still firmly denied it. Wang Shoudao then tried to create a deception: he ordered the landlord Jiao Jinshan to act as a mediator, deceiving Liu Ximeng into taking out 600,000 yuan to sign a reconciliation contract; after the contract was established, Wang Shoudao turned around and said that Liu Ximeng and others bribed him with money. Finally, Liu Ximeng, Liu Jianye, and Liu Jianye's mother were sentenced to death. After the case was clarified and retried, the masses reflected that "if it weren't for the procuratorate, the injustice would never be cleared up."
    The procuratorial work in the past three years has been carried out closely relying on the masses. The procuratorates in many places have mastered the working method of relying on the masses to vigorously handle typical cases. When the Jiaozhou Special District Procuratorate in Shandong Province handled the case of Yuan Kemao's illegal and undisciplined behavior, it investigated two townships and seven villages, a total of 80 households and 140 people. During the investigation process, they helped the masses repair wells and develop winter production, and became one with the masses, so they were able to deeply understand the situation. The procuratorial correspondents and complaint boxes of procuratorates at all levels have become the eyes and ears of the procuratorial organs and the hub for contacting the masses. According to statistics from the Northwest, East China, and Central and South China regions, 10,004 procuratorial correspondents have been established, and 1,331 complaint boxes have been established in the Northwest and East China regions. In 1952, the Northwest and East China regions received 56,448 letters of accusation from procuratorial correspondents and complaint boxes. Most of these accusation materials were true and became a powerful weapon for exposing bureaucracy and illegal and undisciplined behavior. The masses said that "procuratorial correspondents and complaint boxes have cast a dragnet for illegal and undisciplined elements."
    However, there are still many shortcomings in the procuratorial work in the past three years: (1) The development of procuratorial work in various regions is still uneven. Some procuratorates have unclear business ideas, have not implemented the working method of mobilizing the masses and focusing on handling cases, but are entangled in some work outside of procuratorial business, resulting in passive work and little effect. (2) The supervisory work in various regions has not seriously summarized experience, and many good experiences and typical creations have not been summarized and implemented again. The reason for these shortcomings is inseparable from the bureaucratic style of neglecting business leadership, neglecting ideological leadership, and being busy with daily affairs in the procuratorial work. In March of this year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate held a report meeting of the procurators-general of major sub-procuratorates, initially summarizing the past work experience, inspecting the shortcomings in the work, and determining the policy of carrying out procuratorial work with emphasis, creating experience, and steadily establishing the procuratorial system. It was determined that the central task of procuratorial work in 1953 is to fight against illegal and undisciplined behavior in industrial and mining enterprises and in grassroots organizations in counties, districts, and townships. And further implement the working method of focusing on handling cases and focusing on experimentation to create typical cases. Now procuratorates at all levels are actively carrying out work in accordance with the spirit of the report meeting.

### 三年来人民检察工作的初步成绩和经验

　　三年来人民检察工作的初步成绩和经验
    三年来各级人民检察署在中央人民政府和各级地方人民政府的正确领导下，紧密地依靠广大群众和各种违法乱纪行为进行了斗争，并已取得初步的成绩和经验，为今后检察工作的发展、人民检察制度的建立创造了条件。
    三年来检察工作密切地配合了各个社会改革运动，为中心工作服务。从一九五零年以来各级人民检察署积极参加了镇压反革命运动、“三反”“五反”等运动。在镇压反革命运动中，各级人民检察署结合公安机关和人民法院处理了大批反革命案件，并为贯彻惩治反革命条例和保证严厉而正确地惩罚反革命罪犯，检察了许多反革命案件，仅华东一地即检察了一万四千余件。在“三反”“五反”运动中，各级检察署都全力以赴地参加了节约检查委员会的工作，在协助重点部门的“三反”运动中起了相当的作用；尤其是通过检察通讯员和检举箱，给“三反”运动供给了大量材料。徐州市检察署设置的检举箱，在“三反”运动中收到检举贪污、盗窃材料七千零九十八件。根据西北五省一市及部分专、县检察署的统计，共检察起诉重大贪污案犯一千一百零七名，复查贪污案一千九百九十件，并正确贯彻了“是则是，非则非”的原则。
    各级人民检察署在配合司法改革运动中，检察业务有了进一步的开展。根据华东、西北、中南、西南各地检察署的统计，在一九五二年共受理案件七万七千八百七十四件。特别是各地检察署对乱捕、乱打、利用职权恣意侵犯人权、陷害群众的违法行为的斗争，成为整个反对违法乱纪斗争的一个重要方面，打击了很多罪行严重、民愤很大的违法乱纪分子，切实地保障了人民的民主权利。根据一九五二年七十三个各级检察署单位的统计，直接检查处理和参与检察处理的违法乱纪案件共二千七百三十六件。检察署反对违法乱纪的斗争得到群众热烈地拥护，群众称检察署是“能为人民伸冤的新机关”。安徽省怀远县检察署处理了该县前人民法院副院长包庇反革命及区、乡干部非法扣押毒打农民等违法乱纪案件后，得到群众热烈拥护，在该县各界人民代表会议上，还通过了加强检察工作的决议。
    各地人民检察署通过受理群众控告及检察监狱进行了司法监督，纠正了一些公安机关和法院错捕、错押、错判的案件。广东省人民检察署从今年一月至三月收到四百余封群众控告信，揭露了十八件由于违法乱纪而造成的错捕、错押案件。陕西省检察署去年检察了二十三个处理不当的案件，释放无辜群众一百九十五人，查清错判死刑的九人，进行了改判。河南省人民检察署信阳专区分署去年派人视察新蔡县监狱时，发现已被判死刑的农民刘希孟、刘建业两人喊冤；经深入调查，证实这原是一件蓄意陷害的重大冤狱案。刘希孟、刘建业都是辛勤忠厚的农民。一九五零年和他们同村的刘李氏患伤寒症死亡，新蔡县人民法院审判员王守道就勾结地主诬陷为他二人所杀害。经酷刑拷打，刘希孟等仍坚不承认。王守道乃设法制造骗局：令地主焦金山充当调解人，欺骗刘希孟拿出六十万元立和解合同；合同成立后，王守道则反咬一口，说刘希孟等以金钱收买他。终于判刘希孟、刘建业及刘建业母亲死刑。此案查清改判后，群众反映“不是检察署，冤枉永远洗不清”。
    三年来的检察工作，是紧密地依靠着群众来进行的。许多地方的检察署都掌握了依靠群众大张旗鼓办理典型案件的工作方法。山东省胶州专区检察署处理苑克茂违法乱纪一案时，即调查了两个乡、七个村，共八十户、一百四十人。在调查过程中帮助群众修水井、开展冬季生产，和群众打成一片，因而能够深入了解情况。各级检察署的检察通讯员和检举箱已成为检察机关的耳目和联系群众的枢纽。根据西北、华东、中南三区的统计，已建立检察通讯员一万零四名，西北、华东两区共建立检举箱一、三三一个。西北、华东两区在一九五二年从检察通讯员和检举箱收到检举信件五万六千四百四十八件，这些检举材料大部分是真实的，成为揭露官僚主义和违法乱纪的一个有力武器。群众说“检察通讯员和检举箱对违法乱纪分子撒下了天罗地网”。
    但是，三年来的检察工作仍存在着不少的缺点：（一）各地检察工作的发展还不平衡，有一些检察署业务思想不明确，没有贯彻发动群众、重点办案的工作方法，而纠缠在检察业务以外的一些工作上，致使工作被动，作用不大。（二）各地监察工作没有认真地总结经验，没有把许多好的经验和典型创造总结起来再贯彻下去。造成这些缺点的原因，是和检察工作中忽视业务领导、忽视思想领导，而忙于日常事务的官僚主义作风分不开的。今年三月间，最高人民检察署召开各大区分署检察长汇报会议，初步总结了过去的工作经验，检查了工作中的缺点，确定了有重点地开展检察工作，创造经验，稳步建立检察制度的方针。确定一九五三年检察工作的中心任务是和工矿、企业中和县、区、乡基层组织中的违法乱纪行为进行斗争。并进一步贯彻重点办案和重点试验创造典型的工作方法。现在各级检察署正在根据汇报会议的精神，积极地开展工作。
