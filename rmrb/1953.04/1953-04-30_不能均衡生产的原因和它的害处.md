    Reasons for Uneven Production and Its Harms
    Fuxin Mining Bureau Office
    Last year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau's production was uneven. Not a single pit in the entire bureau managed to consistently meet the state's monthly targets throughout the year. On average, 39% of the pits failed to meet their production plans each month (with the figure as high as 49% for pits in the Xinqiu Mine). In the second half of the year, only November saw the completion of the planned increase in underground production; all other months fell short by 4% to 18%. With the underground mines failing to meet their targets, reliance fell on the open-pit mines, which had more favorable natural conditions, to serve as the "trump card" for fulfilling the bureau's overall targets. Since the second half of the year, the open-pit mines have consistently exceeded their planned increase by at least 26% each month, with the highest overshoot reaching 68%.

    Another manifestation of uneven production was the "slack at the beginning, tight at the end" phenomenon, with frequent rushes to meet targets at the end of the month and quarter. On average, the output in the last ten days of each month was 26.4% higher than in the first ten days, and the last month of each quarter was 20% higher than the first month. The fluctuations in output were even more pronounced in the open-pit mines, with an average of 43.2% of the monthly output completed in the last ten days of the month. In November, the output completed in the last ten days accounted for as much as 51% of the total monthly output.

    The harms brought by uneven production to the enterprise are extremely serious.

    First, it affects the entire national economic plan. Last year, because of the drastic fluctuations in our output across months, ten-day periods, and even individual days, we were often unable to supply the state-owned enterprises with the required industrial coal or raw coal according to plan. The most serious case was in October last year when the failure to supply the Lushun-Dalian power plant with washed fine coal in a timely manner almost affected the plant's power generation. Our uneven output also directly disrupted the railway bureau's transportation plans, and we had to pay fines for the backlog of railcars.

    Second, in the context of uneven production and frequent rushes, safety in production and the health of workers cannot be guaranteed. In order to rush production, many cadres and workers violate operating procedures and safety regulations, resulting in many avoidable accidents. At the same time, the excessive overtime work caused by the need to rush tasks deprives workers of adequate rest, and over-fatigue makes accidents more likely.

    Third, uneven production prevents the full realization of labor efficiency and equipment utilization. Taking August as an example, the bureau's extraction rate in the last ten days of the month was 20% higher than in the first ten days, 12% higher than in the middle ten days, and 8% higher than the monthly average efficiency. If the entire month could have achieved the targets of the last ten days, an additional 15,000 tons of raw coal could have been produced. As for the utilization of mechanical equipment, take the two hoists in Ping'an No. 1 pit as an example. Their maximum lifting capacity is 1,470 tons, but the average daily output in January was only 459 tons, resulting in a mechanical utilization rate of only 31%. On November 22nd, however, the output soared to 1,894 tons, exceeding the mechanical load capacity and severely damaging the maintenance and safety of the machinery.

    Fourth, material consumption increases, quality decreases, and the targets for commercial coal varieties cannot be met. When rushing tasks, workers become impatient and, fearing that the explosives will fail to break the coal, tend to use more explosives. This increases the consumption of explosives per ton of coal, and also reduces the size of the raw coal particles, leading to an increase in the gangue content. For example, in the Haizhou Mine, the consumption of explosives per ton of coal in the last ten days of August increased by 23% compared to the first ten days. The size of the coal particles decreased, resulting in an increase in fine coal, and only 33.9% of the planned large-sized coal was produced. As a result, the annual targets for all commercial coal varieties could not be fully met.

    Fifth, it affects the preparation work for production. Doing a good job in preparation is an important condition for ensuring balanced production. However, unbalanced production seriously affects preparation work. Before mining coal in open-pit mines, the overburden must be removed first. But because there is often a need to rush coal mining to make up for the shortfall in underground coal mining, the stripping work is greatly affected. The amount of overburden stripped by the bureau's open-pit mines in the third quarter decreased by 50% compared to the first quarter and by 65% compared to the second quarter. As a result, the bureau completed only 46% of the planned stripping volume for the entire year. The insufficient completion of stripping tasks in the Xinqiu open-pit mine has severely impacted the production tasks for 1953, making it impossible to complete them on schedule. The preparation work for underground coal mining is tunneling. Because of the rush to mine coal, the tunneling tasks in the second half of the year were also poorly completed. The total progress in November decreased by 23% compared to June, and only 90% of the annual task was completed, with only 70.3% of the main roadways completed.

    In addition, because output targets are often not met, workers do not receive their basic wages, leading to low morale and a decline in attendance. Worker absenteeism seriously affects normal production. These two factors interact, disrupting the entire enterprise's work plan, leading to frequent labor transfers, disrupting the allocation of machinery and normal inspection and maintenance procedures, making it difficult to control material quotas, and throwing the entire enterprise management into chaos.

    On the day the state begins to implement the first five-year plan, this chaotic situation can no longer continue.

    What are the reasons for the uneven production?

    The regular cyclical operation of the mining face is the foundation for the rhythmic production of the coal mining industry. Therefore, production can only be balanced by fully ensuring the regular cycle of the mining face. However, ensuring the cyclical operation of the mining face requires not only strengthening the specific management of each mining face, but also close cooperation and mutual guarantee from all departments of the entire enterprise.

    Our production work has improved somewhat over the past year. This is reflected in the increased length of the working faces in the mining and tunneling areas, the increased concentration of operations, the accelerated progress, the partial promotion of the advanced experience of ten-thousand-ton mining faces, and the increased level of mechanization. However, the total number of regular cycles of mining faces is still far from the requirements, and the reason for this is that management work is still lagging behind the requirements of production. The backwardness of management work is manifested in the following aspects:

    First of all, leaders at all levels have an unclear understanding of balanced production. They are satisfied with completing the total output, believing that completing the total task means completing the state plan, and therefore cannot consciously and actively organize balanced production. In terms of management methods, the handicraft-style peasant production method has not been sufficiently criticized and overcome. Everyone uses the method of "making it up at the end of the month" to deal with the output plan. At the beginning of the month, quarter, and year, neither the bureau, the mine, nor the pit is in a hurry, and few people seriously study whether the output is completed or not. It is only at the end of the month, quarter, and year that everyone becomes anxious and begins to organize forces to rush. However, preparation work cannot be done well overnight, and in addition, there are some special conditions for underground operations, so it is often not possible to rush out the deficit tasks as desired. Therefore, one has to rush to catch up in the open-pit mines where the natural conditions are more convenient.

    The lack of clarity in the understanding of leading cadres is also reflected in their narrow definition of balanced production. When organizing balanced production, they only focus on the management of specific cyclical operations on certain mining faces, neglecting to strengthen the improvement of the work of various auxiliary departments, and therefore cannot better guarantee the regular cycle. Everyone has not fully realized that without the guarantee of various business departments, attempting to do a good job of regular circulation in the mining face will be empty talk. When solving the problem of balanced production, leading cadres often start from solving the circulation problem of a specific mining face in isolation, and adopt the method of assigning certain engineering and technical personnel or leading cadres to personally "squat" at the mining face, instead of starting from improving and improving production management, nor organizing the forces of all management departments to jointly solve the problem of mining face circulation. As a result of isolating the management of the mining face from the overall enterprise management and solving temporary and local problems in isolation, the work is always trapped in a passive state of "treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts." Specific problems in the mining face emerge endlessly, and the leadership work is caught off guard everywhere, and many basic problems cannot be solved for a long time.

    Secondly, there is a lack of planning in management work. Balanced production is planned production, which requires strict implementation of the plan. This is especially important in coal mine production. Coal mines are comprehensive enterprises with a wide variety of jobs, and auxiliary production personnel account for more than 60% of the total number of people. The quality of work in the supporting departments directly affects the work of the mining face. Any disruption in any link will be a direct cause of disrupting the work of the mining face. For example, in one pit, the angle of the drill bit was only worn by two millimeters, and the blacksmith did not find it in time. As a result, the hole drilled was too small to hold the explosive, which would affect a small shift's operation. Therefore, without improving the planning of the entire management and enabling each department to correctly implement its own guarantee plan under the unified command of the overall plan, balanced production is difficult to imagine.

    At present, there are still many shortcomings in our planning work.

    First, the plan is not comprehensive enough. Many cadres in auxiliary departments do not know the monthly production plan, let alone how their departments can guarantee the realization of the production plan. This has caused a series of problems in machinery, transportation, labor, and material supply. These problems sometimes even become the main reason affecting underground operations.

    Second, the implementation of the plan is not serious enough. Workers have insufficient understanding of "the national plan is the law," and believe that "failure to complete the task is due to objective influences, and there is nothing to do." Individual grass-roots cadres believe that simply completing the output plan is "all is well." Leading cadres have not actively organized workers to implement the plan, have not thoroughly checked the implementation of the plan, and helped workers solve the problems in implementation. Therefore, good units cannot be commended in time, and no action is taken against units that have failed to complete their tasks for a long time, which has fueled the erroneous idea that "it doesn't matter whether you complete the task or not."

    Third, the plan lacks a mass base. A plan without mass guarantee is just empty talk. However, when formulating plans, we rarely solicit the opinions of the masses and rarely organize mass discussions; when implementing the monthly plan, we mostly just formally announce the output and efficiency figures to the workers, and rarely mobilize the masses to fully discuss and formulate methods to achieve the plan.

    Fourth, the plan lacks realism. Correctly formulating a plan is a prerequisite for guaranteeing the completion of the plan. The Fuxin Mining Bureau's monthly plan often suffers from a lack of investigation, incomplete data, a failure to grasp the geological situation, and a lack of responsibility on the part of some engineering and technical personnel, resulting in many phenomena that are divorced from reality, making the plan itself somewhat blind. There is a disconnect between the annual plan, the quarterly plan, and the monthly plan, and the monthly plan often disconnects from the technical design. Such a plan cannot guide actual production. At the same time, we have not made a measure plan to guarantee the completion of the plan, and we have not organized various forces to complete the plan, so the production plan often fails. Now, we have formulated specific measures based on the requirements of implementing balanced production and the problems identified, and we are preparing to organize all employees to strive for the realization of completing the national plan on a daily and ten-day basis.

    不能均衡生产的原因和它的害处
    阜新矿务局办公室
    阜新矿务局去年的生产是不均衡的。全局没有一个坑口能保持全年都按月完成国家任务，平均每月有百分之三十九的坑口完不成生产计划（新邱矿完不成任务的坑口竟达百分之四十九）。去年下半年，坑内增产任务除十一月份刚刚完成外，其他各月都欠百分之四到十八。坑内完不成任务，只有依靠自然条件方便的露天矿，把它当做弥补全局任务的“王牌”。下半年以来，露天矿每月至少超过增产计划百分之二十六，最多竟达百分之六十八。
    生产不均衡的另一表现是前松后紧，经常月末、季末赶任务。平均全年各月下旬产量比上旬高百分之二十六点四，每季末一个月比季初第一个月高出百分之二十。露天矿各旬间的产量波动更剧烈，全年平均每月产量的百分之四十三点二都是在每月的最后十天内完成的，十一月份更高，下旬完成的产量竟达到全月产量的百分之五十一。
    生产不均衡给企业带来的危害是十分严重的
    第一，影响了整个国民经济计划。去年，因为我们各月、各旬、各日间的产量波动剧烈，就常常不能按计划供应各国营企业所需的工业煤或原煤。最严重的是去年十月份，由于没有及时供给旅大发电厂洗粉煤，几乎影响该厂发电。我们的产量不均衡，也直接打乱了铁路局的运输计划，积压了车皮时，我们还得按章缴纳罚款。
    第二，在生产不均衡，经常需要突击的情况下，安全生产和职工的健康是无法保证的。为了突击生产，很多干部和工人违犯操作规程和安全制度，因而造成许多不应有的事故。同时，因为突击任务，加班加点的现象十分严重，使工人得不到充分的休息，过度疲劳更容易引起事故。
    第三，生产的不均衡，使劳动效率及设备运用率也不能充分发挥。以八月份为例，全局采掘率下旬比上旬高出百分之二十，比中旬高出百分之十二，比全月平均效率高出百分之八。若全月都能达到下旬指标，就可增产原煤一万五千吨。至于机械设备能力的运用，以平安一坑的二台绞车为例，最高提升能力为一千四百七十吨，但一月份平均日产量最低只四百五十九吨，机械利用率只百分之三十一；而十一月二十二日又高达一千八百九十四吨，超过了机械的负荷能力，使机械的维护及安全受到很大的损害。
    第四，材料消耗增加，质量降低，完不成商品品种任务。突击任务时，工人们情绪急躁，怕炮崩不开，总是多放火药。每吨煤火药消耗量增加了，原煤粒度则因而变小，使含矸率增加。如海州矿，八月份每吨煤的火药消耗量下旬比上旬增加了百分之二十三，煤的粒度缩小，粉煤增加，大块只完成计划的百分之三十三点九。因此全年原煤商品品种不能全部完成。
    第五，影响了生产的准备工作。做好准备工作是进行均衡生产的重要条件。但生产不均衡又严重地影响了准备工作。露天矿在采煤之前，必须首先剥离表土。但是因为常常要突击采煤以弥补坑内采煤的不足，剥离工作便受到很大影响。全局第三季露天矿的表土剥离量比第一季减少了百分之五十，比第二季减少了百分之六十五。以致全年全局只完成计划剥离量的百分之四十六。新邱露天矿因为剥离任务完成得太少，已使一九五三年的生产任务受到严重影响，不能按期完成。坑内采煤的准备工作是掘进。因为突击采煤，下半年掘进任务也完成得很差。十一月份总进度比六月份下降百分之二十三，全年只完成任务百分之九十，大巷只完成任务百分之七十点三。
    此外，由于产量任务常常完不成，工人得不到基本工资，情绪低落，出勤率因而下降。工人欠勤，又严重地影响了正常生产。两者相互影响，结果打乱了整个企业的工作计划，使劳动力调动频繁，机械调拨和正常检修维护制度被打乱，材料定额不易掌握，整个企业管理陷于混乱状态。
    在国家开始执行第一个五年计划的今天，这种混乱现象再也不能继续下去了。
    生产不均衡的原因在哪里呢
    采掘场子的正规循环作业，是煤矿工业进行有节奏生产的基础。因此只有充分搞好场子正规循环，生产才能均衡。但搞好场子的循环作业，不只需要加强对每一个场子的具体管理，更需要整个企业各部门紧密配合，互相保证。
    一年来，我们的生产工作是有所改进的。这表现在采掘场子的工作面加长了；作业集中程度提高，进度加速了；部分推广了万吨场子的先进经验；机械化程度提高了。但总的场子正规循环次数则距离要求还很远，原因就在于管理工作还落后于生产的要求。管理工作的落后，表现在以下几方面：
    首先是各级领导干部对均衡生产认识不明确。他们满足于完成产量总数，认为总的任务完成了就是完成了国家计划，因此不能自觉地积极地去组织均衡生产。在管理方法上，手工业的农民生产方式并未被充分批判克服。大家都用“月末找齐”的办法来对待产量计划。月初、季初、年初，无论局、矿、坑都不着忙，产量完成与否很少人去认真研究。到月末、季末、年末，大家才着起急来，开始整顿力量进行突击。但是，准备工作并不是一下就做得好的，加以坑内作业又有些特殊条件，往往不能很如意地一下就突击出亏欠的任务，于是不得不在自然条件便利的露天矿来突击追补。
    领导干部的认识不明确，还表现在他们把均衡生产狭隘化了。组织均衡生产时，只局限于某些具体场子循环作业的管理，忽略了加强各辅助部门工作的改善，因此不能更好地保证正规循环。大家没有充分认识到，离开了各个业务部门的保证，企图做好场子里的正规循环将是空谈。领导干部在解决均衡生产问题时，常常是孤立地从解决某一个具体场子的循环问题着手，采取指派某些工程技术人员或领导干部亲自“蹲场子”的办法，而不是从提高和改进生产管理着手，也不去组织所有管理部门的力量共同解决场子循环问题。像这样把场子的管理从整个企业管理中割裂开去，孤立地解决一时、一地的问题的结果，就使工作始终陷于“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”的被动状态。场子里的具体问题层出不穷，领导工作顾此失彼、处处被动，许多基本问题长期得不到解决。
    其次是管理工作的计划性不够。均衡生产就是计划生产，要求严格执行计划。这一点在煤矿生产中尤其显得重要。煤矿是综合性的企业，工种繁多，辅助生产人员占总人数的百分之六十以上。配合部门工作好坏，直接影响着场子作业。任何一个环节工作紊乱，都会成为打乱场子作业的直接原因。如有一个坑口仅因钎子夹角磨耗了二公厘，铁匠没有及时发现，结果打的眼小了，装不进炮，就会影响
    一个小班作业。因此，不提高整个管理上的计划性，不能使每个部门在总的计划的统一指挥下，正确地执行各自的保证计划，则均衡生产是难于想像的。
        目前我们的计划工作中还有许多缺点
    一、计划不够全面。很多辅助部门的干部不知道当月的生产计划，更谈不到本部门如何保证生产计划的实现。这就造成了机械、运输、劳动力、材料供应等方面一系列的问题。这些问题有时甚至成为影响坑内作业的主要原因。
    二、执行计划不够严肃。职工们对“国家计划即是法律”是认识不足的，认为“完不成任务是客观影响，没啥办法”，个别基层干部认为单纯完成产量计划就算“万事大吉”。领导干部也没有积极地去组织职工实现计划，没有深入检查计划执行情况，帮助职工解决执行中的问题。因此，对好的单位不能及时提出表扬，对长期完不成任务的单位也不作任何处理，致使有的坑口连续十个月没有完成任务，助长了“完成完不成都可以”的错误思想。
    三、计划缺乏群众基础。没有群众保证的计划是纸上空文。但我们在制订计划时，既很少征求群众意见，很少组织群众讨论；在执行月计划时，也多半只是形式主义地把产量、效率数字在工人中宣布一下，很少发动群众充分讨论，制订出实现计划的办法。
    四、计划缺乏现实性。正确制订计划是保证完成计划的先决条件。阜新矿务局的月计划，常常由于探查不清，资料不全，地质情况掌握不住，和部分工程技术人员责任心不够，发生不少脱离实际的现象，使计划本身有若干盲目性。年计划、季度计划和月计划之间脱节，月计划与技术设计也常常脱节。这样的计划是无法指导实际生产的。同时，我们又没有做出保证计划完成的措施计划，没有组织各种力量去完成计划，因此生产计划常常落空。现在，我们已经根据实行均衡生产的要求和检查出的问题，拟出了具体办法，准备组织全体职工，为实现按日、按旬完成国家计划而奋斗。
