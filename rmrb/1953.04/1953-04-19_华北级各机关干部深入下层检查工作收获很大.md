Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: North China-level organs' responsible cadres have reaped great rewards by going deep into lower levels to inspect work. The first group of cadres who inspected the work have returned successively and are now reporting and summarizing. Various units will continue to organize forces to conduct in-depth inspections.
    Since the end of February, North China-level organs have successively organized inspection teams led by Wang Congwu, Minister of the Organization Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ping Jiesan, Minister of the United Front Work Department, Wang Qian, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department, and Liu Xiufeng, Vice Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, to conduct inspections in factories, mines, and rural areas. Over the past month, the inspection teams have discovered and initially resolved many problems in current work. For example, inspections revealed that there were too many tasks in rural areas, which affected production work; and that cooperatives in various places were so busy with rectification work that they hindered the supply of spring plowing production materials. After discovering these problems, the inspection teams were able to coordinate with local leading cadres to study the root causes of the problems and solutions, and promptly reported the discovered problems and situations to higher levels, enabling leading organs to understand the situation at lower levels and improve their leadership in a timely manner. Based on the reports from the inspection teams, the North China Regional Leading Organs have issued timely instructions, properly arranged work, proposed that production is the overriding center, and quickly overcome the spontaneous phenomenon of spring plowing leadership. The North China Cooperative General Agency has instructed various localities to immediately stop the rectification work of grassroots cooperatives and vigorously ensure the supply of production materials.
    Through this in-depth inspection, leading cadres of various departments have further realized that in-depth inspection work is the most effective way to overcome bureaucratism and closely link with the masses. Personnel of the North China Cooperative General Agency Inspection Team believe that: in the past, when sitting in the office, they asked the lower levels for any materials they needed, and always thought it was easy to obtain these materials; this time, going down there, they saw the complexity of the work at the lower levels, and that the source of materials was really not easy. In the future, issuing instructions and making decisions must take into account the specific situation at the lower levels and the difficulties in implementation. Personnel of the Inspection Teams of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and the Commercial Bureau reported that: going down there to take a look, we truly discovered where the problems in our leadership work lie, and felt that we have a way to improve our leadership in the future.
    Various organs are now organizing cadres who have returned from inspections to report and summarize inspection experiences, and continue to send cadres to conduct in-depth inspections. The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau is about to send more cadres to the countryside than the first time to inspect and solve problems in spring plowing production. The North China Cooperative General Agency plans to regularly adopt this method of taking turns going to the countryside to investigate and study, reducing the time spent sitting in the office.

    华北级各机关干部深入下层检查工作收获很大
    【新华社十五日讯】华北级各机关负责干部深入下层检查工作有很大收获。首批检查工作的干部已陆续回来，现正进行汇报总结。各单位将继续组织力量，深入检查。
    华北级各机关自二月底开始先后组织检查组，由中共中央华北局组织部部长王从吾、统一战线工作部部长平杰三、农村工作部副部长王谦和华北行政委员会副主席刘秀峰等负责干部分别率领，深入工厂、矿山、农村进行检查。一个多月来，各检查组发现和初步解决了当前工作中的不少问题。如在检查中发现农村任务繁多，影响生产工作；各地合作社因忙于整顿工作，妨碍了春耕生产资料的供应。各检查组在发现这些问题后，都能协同当地领导干部，研究问题产生的根源和解决办法，并随时把发现的问题和情况向上级反映，使领导机关能及时了解下情改进领导。华北区领导机关根据检查组的反映，已适时发出指示，妥善安排工作，提出生产为压倒一切的中心，较快地克服了春耕领导的自流现象。华北合作总社已指示各地立即停止基层社的整顿工作，大力保证生产供应。
    经过这次深入检查，各部门领导干部进一步体会到深入检查工作是克服官僚主义、密切联系群众的最有效的办法。华北合作总社检查组人员都认为：过去坐在办公室里，需要什么材料就向下边要，总以为这些材料得来的容易；这次下去看到下层工作的复杂，材料来源真不容易。以后发指示、作决定必须考虑下边的具体情况和执行中的困难。农林局、商业局的检查组人员反映：到下边看看，才真正发现我们领导工作的问题所在，觉得以后改进领导有门路了。
    各机关现正组织检查回来的干部进行汇报和总结检查经验，并继续派遣干部深入检查。农林局即将派出较第一次更多的干部下乡，检查解决春耕生产中的问题。华北合作总社计划今后经常采用这种轮流下乡调查研究的方法，减少坐办公室的时间。
