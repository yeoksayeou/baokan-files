Xinhua News Agency Report: The movement to defend the leaders of democratic organizations persecuted by the French government continues to develop nationwide in France.

The Paris region held hundreds of short strikes on the 2nd to protest the illegal arrest of André Stil, editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," and leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT). In most industrial enterprises, from 80% to 100% of the workers stopped working. Construction workers and metalworkers in the Paris region victoriously held a "Day of Action to Defend Arrested Patriots" on the 2nd. Tens of thousands of workers in these two professions participated in rallies, demonstrations, and short strikes of all sizes. Workers in Paris and its suburbs passed resolutions promising to spare no effort to defeat the government's conspiracy, secure the release of arrested peace fighters, and stop the government's infringement on trade union rights.

On the evening of the 2nd, André Doé, secretary of the Seine Department Federation of Trade Unions, and Jean Meunier, editor-in-chief of "Avant-Garde," the organ of the Republican Youth League of France, walked out of Fresnes Prison to a warm welcome from the French people. This was the first victory in the French people's struggle against persecution. Doé was arrested in March along with André Stil, editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," Léo Figuères, organizational secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, and others; Meunier was arrested last October along with Alain Le Léap, secretary-general of the French General Confederation of Labor, and three other leaders of the Republican Youth League of France. They were falsely accused of "attempting to endanger the external security of the state." "l'Humanité" called on the French people to intensify their struggle to win the release of Alain Le Léap, André Stil, and other outstanding peace fighters.

On the 4th, miners in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments announced a 24-hour strike to demand the release of arrested patriots. Forty-six coal mines in these two departments were completely shut down; in addition, 75% to 100% of the workers in more than 20 other coal mines stopped working. Tram workers in Marseille and Toulouse went on strike for 24 hours, and tram workers in Mulhouse went on strike for 2 hours, protesting the government's persecution of leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor and other democratic organizations, and demanding wage increases.

In order to discuss the tasks of the French people and trade union organizations in the anti-persecution struggle, the National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor held a meeting in Paris. The meeting passed a resolution urging the French people to intensify their struggle for the release of leaders of democratic organizations and patriots, and for bread, freedom, national independence, and peace.

The international movement protesting the French government's persecution of democratic organizations continues to develop.

The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) sent a telegram to the United Nations protesting the French government's illegal arrest of progressive French public figures. The WFTU submitted a complaint to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, accusing the French government authorities of persecuting the French General Confederation of Labor and arresting trade union leaders.

Various industrial trade unions in the German Democratic Republic, as well as organizations of peasants and intellectuals, the Polish Youth Union, the Free Austrian Youth League, and Roberto Morena, secretary-general of the Brazilian Workers' Union, have sent telegrams condemning France's suppression of the trade union movement, demanding the immediate release of Alain Le Léap, secretary-general of the French General Confederation of Labor, André Stil, editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," and other imprisoned patriots.
