　　Introduction to the Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic
    The Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic is composed of a portion of the music, opera, and dance performers from the State Music and Drama Theater of the Mongolian People's Republic, and a portion of the acrobats from the State Grand Circus of the Mongolian People's Republic. The art troupe includes 127 people in total, including People's Actors of the Mongolian People's Republic, Meritorious Composers, Meritorious Actors, recipients of the Choibalsan Prize, and outstanding art workers.
    Mongolia is a nation that loves art. Since the victory of the revolution, the Mongolian people have achieved brilliant accomplishments in developing national art and learning advanced Soviet art. The State Music and Drama Theater of the Mongolian People's Republic was developed on the basis of researching and improving national art and learning classical art from the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and countries around the world. As early as after the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution in 1921, under the care and guidance of Marshal Choibalsan, the predecessor of the Music and Drama Theater—an amateur youth theater—was organized. In 1923, the Sukhe-Bator Club was established. By 1931, under the specific leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, and with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, the State Music and Drama Theater was officially established. Every year, the theater absorbs and cultivates a large number of excellent actors from the folk art performances held in Ulaanbaatar. Now it has become a large-scale national theater with more than 300 excellent actors, more than 200 staff members, and completely modern equipment. The head of the art troupe visiting our country this time, People's Actor of the Mongolian People's Republic and recipient of the Choibalsan Prize, Oyun, is the theater's general director. Female singer, Meritorious Actor, and recipient of the Choibalsan Prize, Chogzhilmaa, and other famous actors and dancers are all actors of the Music and Drama Theater. The Music and Drama Theater has created and performed many excellent operas, dances, and musical programs. The famous opera "The Story of Three Mountains" performed by the theater depicts the struggle of the Mongolian people against feudal aristocrats through the love story of a young couple. This opera has been warmly welcomed by the Mongolian people and has been performed more than 1,000 times. The opera "The Road to Happiness," performed by the theater, which depicts the happy life of the Mongolian people and the friendship between Mongolia and the Soviet Union after the victory of the revolution, has achieved high artistic and ideological accomplishments.
    Although Mongolian circus art is relatively young, the Mongolian people's outstanding horsemanship, archery, wrestling, and various acrobatic arts have high international prestige. The State Grand Circus of the Mongolian People's Republic has participated in all World Festivals of Youth and Students and has performed in major cities such as Moscow and Kyiv in the Soviet Union, all of which have received high praise. The circus has also cultivated many successful actors. The main performers visiting our country this time are circus acrobats.
    The list of responsible persons and main actors of the Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic is as follows:
    Oyun (female), Head of the Troupe, People's Actor of the Mongolian People's Republic, recipient of the Choibalsan Prize. (Original head of the troupe, Zhambaldorj, was hospitalized due to illness after arriving in Beijing, and the position of head of the troupe has been changed to Oyun.)
    Wang Gang, Artistic Director.
