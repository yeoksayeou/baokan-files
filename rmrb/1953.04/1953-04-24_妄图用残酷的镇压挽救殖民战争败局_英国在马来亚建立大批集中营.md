    Attempting to Salvage the Defeat of the Colonial War with Brutal Suppression
    Britain Establishes Large Numbers of Concentration Camps in Malaya
    [Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 21st] The British imperialists are establishing more concentration camps in Malaya, intensifying the suppression of the Malayan people's movement for national independence. According to Lockhart, the deputy commander of the British colonial army in Malaya, the British colonial government established as many as 485 concentration camps called "New Villages" in the Federation of Malaya in 1952 alone.
    In the summer of 1950, in order to salvage its continuous failures in the colonial war in Malaya, British imperialism began to implement the so-called "Villagers Resettlement," an important part of the "Briggs Plan." This method involves concentrating Malayan workers and farmers scattered in vast plantations into "New Villages" established by the British colonial government, in an attempt to cut off the food supply to the Malayan National Liberation Army. According to figures admitted in the white paper titled "Villagers Resettlement and the Development of New Villages," published last year by the government of the Federation of Malaya, from April 1950 to the end of March 1952, Britain had established 410 "New Villages" in the Federation of Malaya, imprisoning a total of 423,000 people in concentration camps.
    The British colonial government built these concentration camps next to highways with convenient transportation in order to facilitate the deployment of military police for suppression. The concentration camps are surrounded by one or two layers of barbed wire and watchtowers, guarded by armed police. The gates are heavily guarded, and arc lights illuminate the surrounding barbed wire at night. People in the concentration camps are released every morning to work in nearby plantations patrolled and guarded by British colonial military police, and they are required to return to the concentration camps by a set time. Workers are often innocently shot dead by British troops in rubber plantations. The British military authorities shamelessly include these workers they brutally murdered in their "glorious achievements." When women enter and exit the gates of the concentration camps for inspection, they are frequently subjected to insults by the British colonial military police.
    This fascist measure by British imperialism has not only aroused increasing anger among the Malayan people, but has also deepened the economic crisis in Malaya. Due to the large number of workers and farmers being forced to leave their workplaces, the rural economy has been damaged, and the already unsound Malayan economic situation has deteriorated further. One of the most significant adverse consequences is the reduction in rubber production from small rubber plantations, as most of those imprisoned in concentration camps are workers, farmers, and their families from small rubber plantations. According to figures published by the British colonial government, the output of small rubber plantations in Malaya in 1952 decreased by more than 30,000 tons compared to 1951. The decline has continued this year, with February's output decreasing to just over 19,000 tons. Last December and this January, the output of small rubber plantations was over 22,000 tons.
    At the same time, because farmers are imprisoned in concentration camps, many vegetable gardens have been destroyed, and the supply of vegetables has been greatly reduced, resulting in rising vegetable prices. The price index published by the British colonial government also admits that the prices of most daily necessities increased last year, with vegetables increasing the most. Coupled with the rising price of food, the lives of the working people have become even more difficult.
    Pig raising is an important side business for Malayan farmers. After a large number of farmers were imprisoned in concentration camps, the number of pigs raised in Malaya has decreased sharply. As a result, many farmers have lost an important source of income.
    Due to the continuous decrease in income of the broad masses of working people in Malaya, coupled with the fact that British imperialism has shifted the heavy burden of its colonial war expenses onto them, their purchasing power is getting lower and lower, which has affected industry and commerce and further deteriorated the entire Malayan economic situation.

    妄图用残酷的镇压挽救殖民战争败局
    英国在马来亚建立大批集中营
    【新华社二十一日讯】新加坡消息：英帝国主义者正在马来亚建立更多的集中营，加紧镇压马来亚人民争取民族独立的运动。据英国驻马来亚殖民军的副指挥官洛克哈特承认，英国殖民政府单在一九五二年，在马来亚联合邦新建立的名为“新村”的集中营就有四百八十五个。
    英帝国主义为了挽救它在马来亚的殖民战争的不断失败，在一九五零年夏季，开始实行作为“布里格斯计划”重要部分的所谓“村民移殖”。这个办法就是把散居在广大种植园中的马来亚工人和农民，集中关进英国殖民政府建立的“新村”，以图断绝马来亚民族解放军的粮食供应。据马来亚联合邦政府去年发表的题为“村民移殖和新村的发展”白皮书中所承认的数字，从一九五零年四月到一九五二年三月底，英国在马来亚联合邦已设立了四百一十个“新村”，被关进集中营的共四十二万三千人。
    英国殖民政府把这些集中营都建立在交通方便的公路旁边，以便利它调动军警进行镇压。集中营的周围都设置着一道或两道的铁丝网，以及了望塔，由武装警察守卫，门警森严，夜间还有弧光灯照射着周围的铁丝网。关在集中营里的人每天早晨被放出来，到附近有英国殖民军警巡逻、把守的种植园中去工作，并且限时回到集中营去。工人常在橡胶园中无辜被英军打死。英军当局还极端无耻地把这些他们残酷屠杀了的工人列入他们的“辉煌战绩”，妇女进出集中营的栅门受检查时，更经常受到英殖民军警的侮辱。
    英帝国主义的这种法西斯措施，不但激起了马来亚人民的愈来愈大的愤怒，同时也加深了马来亚的经济危机。由于巨大数目的工人和农民被迫离开他们的工作地点，农村经济受破坏，本来就不健全的马来亚经济情况就更加恶化。最显著的恶果之一就是小胶园橡胶生产量的减少，因为被关进集中营的大多数是小胶园的工人、农民和他们的家庭。据英国殖民政府发表的数字，一九五二年马来亚小胶园产量比一九五一年减少三万多吨。今年来又继续减少，二月份产量减少到只有一万九千多吨。去年十二月份和今年一月份，小胶园产量都有二万二千吨以上。
    同时，由于农民被关进集中营，很多菜园被破坏，蔬菜供应大为减少，因而菜价上涨。英国殖民政府发表的物价指数也承认，去年大多数日用品都涨价，而其中蔬菜涨得最多。加以粮食价格不断上涨，劳动人民的生活已更加困难了。
    养猪是马来亚农民的重要副业之一。大批农民被关进集中营后，马来亚养猪数目锐减，因此，许多农民失去了重要的收入。
    由于马来亚广大劳动人民的收入不断减少，再加上英帝国主义把它进行殖民战争的沉重战费负担转嫁到他们身上，他们的购买力越来越低，因而影响到工商业，并使整个马来亚经济情况进一步恶化。
