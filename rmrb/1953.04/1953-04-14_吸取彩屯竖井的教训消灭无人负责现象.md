    Learn from the Lessons of the Caitun Vertical Shaft and Eliminate the Phenomenon of No One Taking Responsibility

    Due to serious bureaucracy in the leadership of the Caitun Vertical Shaft project in Benxi, there has been a phenomenon of no one taking responsibility during the construction process. Since last year, the main project has consistently failed to meet the state's planned progress. If effective measures are not taken immediately to change this situation, not only will the large amount of capital invested by the state fail to be put into timely use, but it will also directly affect the production of the metallurgical sector, impacting the progress of national construction and causing serious waste to the state and the people.

    The bureaucracy in the leadership of the Caitun Vertical Shaft project is mainly manifested in the failure to actively organize existing forces and forces that could be organized to overcome difficulties and complete tasks after the plan was formulated. Consequently, no one was responsible for anything in the project: no one was specifically responsible for directing the overall mine project progress; no one was responsible for solving the lack of water pumps; the "central pipes" were frequently blocked, and no one was responsible for dealing with it; when tasks were not completed, the mine director would question the departments, the department heads would question the section chiefs, the section chiefs would call a meeting with the workers, say a few words to them, and some would simply ignore it; and when difficulties were encountered at the lower levels, they were pushed upwards layer by layer. Under such a serious situation of no one taking responsibility, waste was inevitable. In order to overcome this chaotic phenomenon, it is necessary to immediately mobilize the workers to deeply expose these serious waste phenomena, the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility, and the bureaucracy in the leadership, and to establish and improve various responsibility systems. This is the key issue that urgently needs to be resolved in the Caitun Vertical Shaft project.

    The phenomenon of no one taking responsibility that exists in the Caitun Vertical Shaft project is also a common problem in capital construction projects in the fuel sector today. For example, in the foundation project of the Daye Power Plant, it was discovered during construction that the quality was too poor, but because the relationship between Party A and Party B was unclear, no one was responsible. Party B continued to build blindly, and Party A did not offer any opinions, resulting in the rework of the project, delayed construction, and serious waste. The eighty-six dormitories built by the Liangxiang Electrical Repair Factory were completely demolished after completion due to changes in layout; the heating trench originally designed on the east side of the factory building was built on the west side; the distance between the columns of the factory building manufacturing cement poles was originally designed to be three meters but was temporarily changed to four meters, resulting in more than forty cracks being found in the crane beam after completion due to the increased span; although the problems are so serious, it is difficult to determine the main person responsible.

    These situations illustrate that mobilizing workers in construction departments to focus on exposing various waste phenomena and the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility, criticizing various erroneous ideas, and establishing and improving various necessary responsibility systems (such as the contract responsibility system between Party A and Party B, various management and supervision systems during construction, quality inspection systems, and sectional inspection and acceptance systems) is a major link in ensuring the comprehensive completion of this year's construction plan, and is also the specific content of carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy in the capital construction departments.

### 吸取彩屯竖井的教训消灭无人负责现象

    吸取彩屯竖井的教训消灭无人负责现象
    本溪彩屯竖井工程由于领导上有严重的官僚主义，施工过程中存在着无人负责现象，从去年以来，主要工程一直没有完成国家计划进度。这种情况假如不立即采取有效措施加以改变，不但会使国家投入的大量资金不能及时发生作用，而且会直接影响冶金部门的生产，影响国家建设的进程，给国家和人民造成严重的浪费。
    彩屯竖井工程领导上的官僚主义，主要表现在当计划制定了之后，没有积极组织现有力量和可能组织起来的力量，克服困难，完成任务。因而在工程中事事无人负责：全矿工程进度无专人负责指挥；缺乏水泵问题无人负责解决；“中心管子”经常堵塞无人负责处理；任务完不成，矿长追问各科，科长追问股长，股长找工人开个会，说他几句，有的还干脆不理；下面遇到困难又层层往上推。在这种严重的无人负责的情况下，浪费现象就势在难免了。为了克服这种混乱现象，必须立即发动职工深入揭发这些严重的浪费现象、无人负责现象和领导上的官僚主义，建立和健全各种责任制。这就是彩屯竖井工程当前急待解决的关键问题。
    彩屯竖井工程存在的无人负责现象，也是今天燃料部门基本建设工程中普遍存在的问题。如大冶发电厂的基础工程，在施工中已发现质量太差，但由于甲乙两方关系不明，无人负责，乙方继续盲目建设，甲方不提意见，以致造成了工程返工，拖延工期和严重浪费的恶果。良乡电业修配厂修建的八十六间宿舍，完工以后又变更布置，全部拆除；原设计在厂房东边的暖气沟修在厂房的西边；制造水泥杆的厂房，柱子之间的距离原设计为三公尺，临时改变为四公尺，以致天车梁因跨度增大，完工后发现裂缝四十多处；问题虽然这样严重，但很难确定主要的负责者。
    这些情况说明：在施工部门中发动职工集中揭发各种浪费现象和无人负责现象，批判各种错误思想，建立和健全各种必要的责任制度（如甲乙方的合同责任制、施工中的各种管理和监督制度、质量检查制度和分部分段的检查验收制度等），是保证全面完成今年施工计划的主要环节，也是当前在基本建设施工部门贯彻反对官僚主义斗争的具体内容。
