Xinhua News Agency Report: Volunteer Army commanders and fighters have received this year's summer uniforms, even before they have taken off their cotton-padded clothes.

In late March, the logistics units transported the summer uniforms for the entire army from the distant Yalu River to the front lines in just two days. The summer clothing includes single-layer uniforms, shirts and pants, single socks, towels, and mosquito nets. Clothing workers from all over the country extensively solicited the opinions of the Volunteer Army last year and made many improvements to this year's summer uniforms. They added a layer of thick cloth to areas of the new single-layer uniforms that are easily worn; elastic bands were sewn into the cuffs of the pants to prevent insects from entering; and the brims of the hats were densely sewn with thread to prevent rain and water from soaking in.

The soldiers are very satisfied with this new single-layer uniform suitable for battlefield use. Zhang Yongming, the deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, opened each piece of clothing to carefully examine the markings inside. They even composed a quick-clapper rhyme: "New summer uniform, truly good, high quality, skillful work, sent early across thousands of mountains and rivers!" The soldiers of the First Squad of a certain Volunteer Army unit guarding a position, after receiving their new single-layer uniforms, got up the next morning to build fortifications and practice their skills. Soldier Chen Yuanlun said: "In order to protect the realization of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan, I will fight even more bravely and make the American aggressors dare not run wild in front of the Chinese and Korean people!"

A private first class from the Rhee Syngman army's independent division, who surrendered to our army, saw the new single-layer uniforms and abundant daily necessities of our army soldiers and said enviously: "We (referring to the Rhee Syngman army) haven't even heard about our summer uniforms! In previous years, they were issued as early as May 1st, but this year we can't even get enough to eat, so what are we talking about clothes!"

    志愿军指挥员战斗员领到了夏季服装
    据新华社讯：中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员们棉衣还没脱下，已经领到了今年的夏季服装。
    三月下旬，后勤部队在两天内就将全军的夏季服装由遥远的鸭绿江边运到了前线。夏装中有单衣、衬衣裤、单袜、毛巾和蚊帐。祖国各地的被服工人还在去年就广泛地征求过志愿军的意见，将今年的夏装作了许多改进。他们在新单衣容易磨破的地方加缝了一层厚布；裤脚都缝了防备虫子钻入的松紧带；帽沿上用线密密地缝了起来，不怕雨淋水浸。
    战士们对这种适合战地应用的新单衣十分满意。某部副排长张永明把每件衣服都打开来仔细地看看里面的印记，他们还编了一首快板：“新夏衣，真正好，质量高，活儿巧，千山万水送来早！”守卫在某处阵地上的志愿军某部第一班的战士们，在领到新单衣的第二天早晨，就起来修筑工事、练本领，战士陈元伦说：“为了保卫祖国第一个五年计划的实现，我要更加英勇的战斗，叫美国侵略军不敢在中朝人民面前撒野！”
    向我军投诚的李伪军独立师的一个一等兵看见我军战士们的新单衣和丰富的日用品，羡慕地说：“我们（指李伪军）的夏衣还没有信呢！往年最早是五月一日发，今年连饭都吃不饱，还谈什么衣服呀！”
