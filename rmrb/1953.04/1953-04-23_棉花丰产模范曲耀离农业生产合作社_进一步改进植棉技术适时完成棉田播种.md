    Cotton Bumper Harvest Model Qu Yao Li Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Further Improves Cotton Planting Technology to Complete Cotton Field Sowing on Time
    The Qu Yao Li Agricultural Production Cooperative in Quzhuangtou Village, Xie County, Shanxi Province, a cotton bumper harvest model, completed the sowing of all 112.5 mu of cotton fields in the cooperative on April 13.
    This year, Qu Yao Li Cooperative's cotton planting technology has been further improved. For the 20 mu of high-yield irrigated cotton fields, after the cotton stalks were pulled out after last autumn's harvest, 6,900 jin of base fertilizer per mu were applied to 7 mu of land, breaking the old habit of not applying fertilizer in the autumn; at the same time, the cooperative plowed all the cotton fields once, followed by deep plowing. After thawing this spring, all the cooperative's cotton fields were shallowly plowed once and shallowly cultivated twice. During cultivation and after each snowfall and rain, harrowing and pressing were carried out to conserve moisture. This preserved the soil moisture and ensured timely sowing. This year, the high-yield cotton fields were fertilized with 13,000 jin of base fertilizer and 60 jin of cottonseed cake per mu, the general irrigated cotton fields were fertilized with 9,200 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and the dryland cotton fields were fertilized with 6,900 jin per mu. Qu Yao Li accepted advanced scientific and technological guidance and used "superphosphate" mixed with cattle manure and rice bran to produce 240 jin of granular fine fertilizer. Twelve jin of granular fertilizer were added as base fertilizer to each mu of high-yield land. The treatment of cottonseeds was also more refined this year than last year. To prevent the cottonseeds from becoming damp during long-term storage, which would affect germination and make the cotton seedlings prone to early blight, all 1,736 jin of cottonseeds in the cooperative were universally turned and dried for three days before sowing, and warm water soaking and chemical dressing were carried out using the "fixed temperature and timing" soaking method. To ensure close planting and full emergence, Qu Yao Li Cooperative sowed very densely this year: 17 jin of cottonseeds per mu in irrigated land and 11 jin per mu in dryland.
    After the Qu Yao Li Mutual Aid Team was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative last winter, it implemented unified land management and more detailed division of labor. After the rain on April 10, the cooperative immediately rationally divided the labor according to the specialties of each member, started sowing on the 11th, and completed all sowing on the 13th. They also achieved considerable success in fertilizer accumulation. Before last year's spring plowing, the Qu Yao Li Mutual Aid Team bought more than 120 cartloads of sheep manure from Yuncheng because of insufficient fertilizer accumulation. After the establishment of the cooperative, the entire cooperative concentrated its efforts on opening up fertilizer sources, successively transforming seven dry latrines into water latrines, and also built two large fertilizer accumulation pits (each pit can accumulate 30 cartloads of manure), and organized the entire cooperative's labor force to dig alley soil, turn residual soil, etc., accumulating more than 300 cartloads of fertilizer in total. This ensured that all the cooperative's cotton fields had sufficient base fertilizer this year, changing the phenomenon of buying manure from outside during the spring plowing period in previous years.
    Before sowing, Qu Yao Li also taught the sowing techniques of soaking seeds, dressing seeds, and how to ensure full emergence to more than 30 people, including mutual aid team leaders and technicians in the village. He called on cotton farmers in the village to learn more scientific technology and advanced experience. He said: "The soaking method we used to use of 'a splash of hot water, a save with cold water' is not as good as the 'fixed temperature and timing' method we are using now. It is not only not afraid of scalding the cottonseeds, but also helps the seeds germinate earlier." Qu Yao Li also proposed to everyone: This year, we must achieve appropriate close planting, equidistant full emergence, but we must never "blindly do it." He said: "The seedlings should be dense, but they should be uniform, there should be no missing seedlings, and there should be no crowded clumps. The row spacing should not be too narrow, generally about one chi and eight cun apart." This year, he plans to keep 4,000 seedlings per mu in irrigated cotton fields and 4,500 seedlings per mu in dryland cotton fields.

    棉花丰产模范曲耀离农业生产合作社
    进一步改进植棉技术适时完成棉田播种
    山西解县曲庄头村棉花丰产模范曲耀离农业生产合作社，在四月十三日完成了全社一百一十二亩五分棉田的播种。
    今年曲耀离社的植棉技术又有了进一步的改进。二十亩水地丰产棉田，去年秋收拔完棉秸以后，就在七亩地里每亩施底肥六千九百斤，打破了以往秋季不施肥的守旧习惯；同时把全社棉田普耙了一遍，接着又进行了一次深耕。今春解冻后，全社的棉田又浅翻了一遍、浅耕了两遍。在耕地时及每次雪雨以后，又进行耙耱保墒。这样便保住了地内水分，保证了适时下种。今年丰产棉田每亩施底肥一万三千斤、棉籽饼六十斤，一般水地棉田每亩施底肥九千二百斤，旱地棉田每亩施六千九百斤。曲耀离接受了先进的科学技术指导，用“过磷酸钙”拌搅牛粪及谷糠，制造了二百四十斤颗粒状细肥。在每亩丰产地内增施了十二斤颗粒状肥料的底肥。在棉籽处理上，今年也较去年更加精细。为防止棉籽久藏发湿，影响发芽及棉苗幼期易发生立梢病等现象，全社一千七百三十六斤棉籽都在下种前普遍翻晒了三天，并用“定温定时”的浸种方法进行了温汤浸种和药剂拌种。曲耀离社为保证做到密植、全苗，今年的棉田下种很稠：水地棉每亩下种十七斤，旱地棉每亩十一斤。
    曲耀离互助组由去冬转为农业生产合作社后，实行了土地统一经营和更细密的劳动分工，四月十日落雨后，该社即根据各个社员的特长，合理分工，十一日开始下种，十三日即全部种完。他们在积肥工作上也获得了不小的成绩。去年春耕前，曲耀离互助组因积肥不够，光由运城就买回一百二十余车羊粪。建社后，全社集中力量开辟肥源，先后把七个旱茅房变为水茅房，还打了两个大积肥坑（每个坑能积粪三十车），并组织全社劳力挖巷土、翻残土等共积肥三百余车。这样，便保证了今年全社棉田普遍有了足够的底肥，改变了往年春耕期间到外面去买粪的现象。
    在下种前，曲耀离并向本村互助组长、技术员等三十余人传授了浸种、拌种以及如何保证全苗的播种技术。他号召全村棉农多多学习科学技术和先进经验，他说：“先前咱们用‘热水一泼、冷水一救’的浸种方法，就不如眼下实行的‘定温定时’方法好。既不怕烫坏棉籽，又能帮助种籽早发芽。”曲耀离并向大家提出：今年一定要做到适当密植、等距全苗，但千万不敢“盲干”。他说：“苗要留稠，但要匀称，不宜缺苗，也不宜挤圪塔，行距不要过窄，一般的要相距一尺八寸左右。”他今年准备水地棉每亩留四千株苗，旱地棉留四千五百株苗。
