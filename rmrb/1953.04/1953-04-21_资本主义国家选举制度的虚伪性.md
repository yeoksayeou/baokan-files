When it comes to universal suffrage, people often easily think of the slogan "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot." It was only after the implementation of the Stalin Constitution in the Soviet Union that truly democratic universal suffrage, fully consistent with the content of this slogan, was realized for the first time in human history. The electoral system stipulated in our electoral law belongs to the same system as the Soviet electoral system, because our New Democratic regime will guide our country towards a socialist future, towards the complete realization of the "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" of national democratic elections.

Our electoral system is fundamentally incomparable to the formal, hypocritical, and deceptive electoral systems that any capitalist country has ever implemented or is currently implementing.

The slogan "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" was originally a political slogan put forward by the bourgeoisie in the era of opposing feudal rule and despotism. However, although the bourgeoisie put forward this "progressive" slogan, it was fundamentally impossible for them to realize it. More than a hundred years of history have proven that under the conditions of bourgeois rule, truly democratic elections with "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" have never been realized.

                            ×    ×    ×

Let's first look at the United States—a country that has always called itself the most "democratic" and today even calls itself the leader of the so-called "free world" and "democratic countries."

In the United States, the Constitution stipulates the "granting" of the right to "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" to all citizens, and declares that no citizen can be deprived of the right to vote due to race, color, or gender. However, in fact, the US Constitution is only a tool used by the bourgeoisie to deceive and rule the broad masses of people, and the civil rights it stipulates are merely empty words.

The laws of many states stipulate property restrictions for elections: Georgia stipulates that only voters who own forty acres of land or have the ability to pay three hundred yuan in taxes can vote; Alabama and Mississippi stipulate that only voters who have paid a considerable amount of poll tax and can provide a receipt as proof can participate in elections; seven southern states have laws stipulating that election tax must be paid to vote; and thirteen states nationwide have laws stipulating that the very poor and voters receiving state relief have no right to vote. Due to these property conditions, millions of working people are unable to enjoy the electoral rights conferred by the Constitution.

The laws of all US states stipulate restrictions on the "period of residence" required for elections (varying from state to state, roughly from three months to two years). This restriction deprives millions of travelers, seasonal workers, and wandering unemployed people of the opportunity to participate in elections. In the 1948 general election, 2 million voters were unable to participate in elections due to insufficient residence period, and 3.5 million voters were unable to participate in elections because they were traveling.

Many state laws stipulate restrictions on "educational level" and "providing various evidence and documents." Some states require voters to prove that they can read constitutional provisions in English and write their names before they are allowed to vote; other states require voters to take a test on "educational level" before the election, and only those who pass can participate in the election.

Many state laws stipulate restrictions on "religious belief" and "occupation." For example, North Carolina stipulates that "atheists" are not allowed to vote. In addition, the laws of twenty-nine states stipulate that soldiers and sailors do not have the right to vote.

According to the US official materials themselves, there are more than fifty kinds of restrictions like these.

In the United States, women did not obtain the right to vote nominally equal to men until 1920.

Here, national and racial discrimination deprives millions of black people, Jews, Slavs, Eastern peoples, and native Indians of the right to vote conferred by the Constitution.

Black people, who account for one-tenth of the total US population, are treated the most miserably. Various restrictions such as property conditions, residency periods, and educational levels are combined, resulting in only a few black people being able to enjoy the right to vote. The property conditions stipulated in the laws of southern states are impossible for most black people to meet. In those states with "educational level" restrictions, white examiners often deliberately ask black people to answer difficult questions such as "What does Article 5 of the Constitution stipulate?" "Who was the fourth president of the United States?" when conducting literacy and cultural level tests. Everyone knows that such exams are difficult for even many well-educated white people to pass, especially among the American people who do not pay attention to politics.

Here, the bourgeoisie plays clever election tricks, using all kinds of "election techniques" to ensure the victory of Wall Street tycoons in elections. The laws of many states restrict progressive parties from nominating candidates. For example, the law of Illinois stipulates that parties that did not receive one million votes in the state in the previous general election are not qualified to nominate candidates. In the 1948 general election, the Progressive Party was unable to nominate its own candidates in many states due to this restriction.

Here, it is said in words that congressmen and presidents are "directly" elected by voters, but in reality, voters can only elect "electors," who then elect the president and congressmen in the second round of voting.

Here, it is said in words that "secret ballot" is conducted, but in reality, the election is manipulated by party bosses of the two parties ("Republican Party" and "Democratic Party"). According to Giddings, a famous American professor, the United States has always had "only five percent of voters who can vote freely."

After World War II, under Truman's rule, the United States openly embarked on the road of fascism, and elections also became completely fascist.

Party bosses and leaders control local election institutions. They use various illegal means to solicit votes for their candidates. Dewey, the Governor of New York State who had close ties with the Wall Street Group, supported the nomination of Eisenhower as a presidential candidate. At a Republican caucus, he meaningfully told the delegates: "I will be governor for another two and a half years, and my memory is very good." He warned those who did not vote for Eisenhower that if the vote was "inappropriate," two days later, when the conference ended and they returned home, they "would find that their relatives and friends were no longer in their original positions." Threats, bribery, rumors, slander, threats of illegal dismissal, and incidents of unwarranted beatings, imprisonments, and even killings of voters and electors occurred every day during the campaign.

On the other hand, fascists unscrupulously obstructed and undermined the campaign activities of progressive party candidates. In the 1952 presidential election, newspapers controlled by monopoly capitalists hyped up every word of the Democratic and Republican candidates, but did not mention a word about the speeches made by the Progressive Party candidates; the Truman administration controlled radio stations and did not allow Progressive Party candidates to give radio speeches; fascist thugs spread slander everywhere and used political persecution and police terror to obstruct and undermine the Progressive Party's campaign propaganda; finally, on the eve of the election, they spread all kinds of terrifying rumors to prevent large numbers of voters and electors from voting for Progressive Party presidential candidate Hallinan and Mrs. Bass.

The various restrictions imposed on elections, as well as the increasingly severe fascist terror created during elections, have, in fact, completely nullified the "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" electoral rights conferred by the Constitution to American citizens. Elections held every few years have become an embellishment of bourgeois "democracy" in the United States.

According to figures released by the US government, in the 1944 presidential election, 48 million of the country's 88 million voters did not participate in voting for various reasons; in the 1946 congressional elections, only 38 percent of voters went to the polls; in the 1948 presidential election, 44 million of the country's 94 million voters were unable to participate in the election due to various restrictions. As a result, Truman was elected president with only 24 million votes (about a quarter of the total number of voters, or one-sixth of the country's total population of 150 million); in the 1950 congressional elections, 56 percent of voters were unable to participate in voting; and in the 1952 presidential election, Eisenhower was elected president with more than 33.02 million votes.

                                    ×    ×    ×

Next, let's take a look at the United Kingdom.

In the UK's past and present electoral systems, we can see various restrictions and destructions of the democratic election principles of "universal and equal."

First of all, property conditions deprive the vast proletariat of the right to vote and be elected.

From the time of Henry VI until 1918, successive electoral laws expressly stipulated that the acquisition of the right to vote was based on certain property conditions. Precisely for this reason, according to statistics, from 1884 until the promulgation of the new electoral law in 1918, each election saw about two million adult men (mainly workers and farmers, of course) unable to participate in the election.

Although the electoral law of 1918 abolished the previous naked restrictions on property conditions, it replaced them with some new provisions that were of the same nature but more cleverly disguised. Many provisions of the 1918 electoral law are still valid today.

This electoral law stipulates the "domicile qualification" for obtaining the right to vote: one must reside in a constituency for more than six months to be registered as a voter in that district—everyone knows that most working people, especially workers, are unable to have a fixed domicile.

In addition, this electoral law also stipulates that anyone who occupies land or other residence worth more than ten pounds due to occupation, business, or stock exchange relations can be registered as a voter in the district where the land or residence is located.

The purpose of the former provision is to deprive the proletariat of the right to vote, while the purpose of the latter provision is to grant property owners two votes. In 1931, there were a total of 137,731 voters in London who enjoyed this second vote. In a certain constituency concentrated with banks and large enterprises, the voter register contained 44,000 people, while the actual population living here and reaching the voting age was only about 7,000. The remaining 37,000 people obtained the right to vote for the second time because they owned businesses, banks, real estate, and land in this district.

This is bourgeois "democracy"! As Lenin said, it is "a paradise for the rich and a trap and deception for the poor and exploited" (Lenin Selected Works, Moscow Chinese edition, 1949, Vol. 2, p. 438).

Secondly, there are restrictions on age, occupation, education level, etc.

In the UK, the conscription law stipulates that citizens who are 18 years old should serve in the military, but the electoral law stipulates that one must be 21 years old to participate in elections.

In the UK, the law stipulates that public officials cannot participate in elections; they must resign from their posts to run for election. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of soldiers currently serving in the military are prohibited from participating in any political activities.

In the UK, people who have received higher education can also enjoy the right to vote twice in parliamentary elections due to obtaining a university degree
(one vote in their district of residence; another vote in the university constituency), while working people who do not have certain property conditions and cannot enjoy higher education do not even have the opportunity to vote once.

Thirdly, there is inequality between men and women and inequality between races.

British women did not obtain the right to vote and be elected for the first time until 1918. Before this, women, who accounted for half of the population, had no right to participate in elections at all. Even in the 1918 electoral law, the unequal situation between men and women was still partially retained: men only needed to be 21 years old, while women had to be 30 years old to participate in elections.

In addition, from the compilation of voter registers and counting of votes to the end of the election, the bourgeoisie often uses details in the election work to carry out shameless deception; through every detail of the election work, it undermines the democratic principles of "universal and equal." Facts have proven that every detail of election work actually has great political significance.

In the election campaigns of several general elections after the war, the warmongers openly restricted the campaign activities of the Communist Party and the working people. They manipulated the country's propaganda weapons and did not give the Communist Party the opportunity to use radio for election broadcasts. It was only after the protest of British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt that they reluctantly allowed the British Communist Party to be allocated eight and a half minutes of broadcast time, but only allowed it to be broadcast once, and deliberately arranged it at 6:15 pm, when workers were busy with work and unable to listen. As one writer wrote, these eight and a half minutes were merely "decorations of British democracy"! Before the 1950 general election, the Labor government announced a ban on marches in the London area for three months. In addition, they often refused to rent venues available for public gatherings to the Communist Party for holding election rallies on various excuses. Governors and mayors controlled the election institutions and shamelessly violated
The democratic principle of "secret ballot" was to send people to record the registration numbers of voters on the ballot stubs, in order to track down the political attitudes of voters. A Labor canvasser threatened to evict a female voter from a house built by the local Labor committee because she was unwilling to vote for the Labor candidate. A Conservative landlord fired several workers because he heard these workers say that they did not like Churchill. Catholic priests threatened that any parishioners who voted for the Communist Party would be excommunicated. Examples like this can be encountered all over the country.

This is how the warmongers use every detail in the election work to carry out deception and intimidation.

Today, the British people have lost even the little bit of democratic rights that were greatly restricted. The bourgeoisie has completely abandoned the banner of "freedom" and "democracy." The Conservative and Labor parties, which sell out the interests of the British nation, have turned the entire United Kingdom into a tool serving the US war policy. Today, the democratic election principles of "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" have been completely destroyed in the UK. The increasing fascistization of the electoral system heralds the imminent demise of bourgeois rule.

This is the election situation in Britain, past and present.

                                    ×    ×    ×

Finally, let's take a look at France.

Historically, the French bourgeoisie raised the banner of "freedom" and "democracy" and chanted the slogan of "natural human rights." The "Declaration of the Rights of Man" of 1789 also enshrined "the right to be born with freedom and equality" into law. However, once the bourgeoisie seized power, they immediately betrayed their oaths.

        The Constitution of 1791, the Electoral Law of 1817, and the Law of 1831 all added restrictions on age, gender, and property qualifications to the right to vote.

        In 1871, the Paris Commune established the laboring people's own regime for the first time in human history. For the first time in human history, "universal suffrage" was transformed into a tool for destroying the bourgeois parliamentary system and organizing the workers' class regime. After the failure of the Commune, the bourgeoisie established the Third French Republic. Here, they restored their own electoral system, which violated democratic principles.

        The Electoral Law of 1875 stipulated that French "men" who were 21 years of age or older had the right to vote, but to enjoy the right to be elected, they had to be 25 years of age or older. In addition, this electoral law also stipulated that soldiers could not participate in elections; officials who received salaries from the national treasury could not also serve as members of parliament.

These restrictions on age, occupation, and period of residence still exist today. Precisely for this reason, more than half of the current 42 million people in France still do not enjoy the right to vote.

Women and men enjoyed equal electoral rights only after World War II. Before this, in 1913, the majority of members of parliament had rejected the proposal for "women to participate in elections." Two provisions concerning women's elections, which were originally included in the election bill in 1919, were also rejected by the majority of members of parliament. French women, who account for half of the population, obtained the right to vote completely equal to men only in the Constitution of the Fourth Republic in 1946.

The French bourgeoisie, like the British bourgeoisie, also uses every detail in the election work to carry out manipulative and destructive activities.

In the 1932 election, the first constituency in Paris, where the bourgeois voters were in the majority, elected one member of parliament per 8,000 voters; while the electoral district of Kobel, located in the suburbs where the proletarian voters were in the majority, elected one member of parliament per 50,000 voters. As a result, it was guaranteed that the bourgeoisie "legally" obtained more seats in the National Assembly than the workers. In this year's election, the Communist Party received a total of 800,000 votes and only obtained twelve seats, while the bourgeois Radical Socialist Party received a total of 1.85 million votes (more than twice as many as the Communist Party) but obtained 157 seats (twelve times more than the Communist Party).

After World War II, due to the great strengthening of democratic forces throughout Europe and the persistent struggle of the Communist Party, a relatively democratic "proportional representation" electoral system was implemented in 1946, distributing the seats that each party should obtain in the National Assembly according to the proportion of votes they received in the electoral district. Under the conditions of bourgeois rule, this is certainly a relatively democratic system, because it can guarantee that voters of all political tendencies have their own representatives in parliament. Precisely for this reason, in this general election, the French Communist Party, having received nearly six million votes (one-third of all votes), obtained 166 seats in the National Assembly's total of 627 seats, becoming the largest party in the National Assembly.

The fact that the French Communist Party and its supporters occupied nearly one-third of the seats in the National Assembly, and the fact that the French Communist Party persistently struggled inside and outside the parliament to defend the interests of the French people, defend peace, and defend the freedom and independence of the French nation, could not but shock the bosses of Wall Street and one of their pawns—the French reactionaries. In order to make the French National Assembly more obedient to the United States, under the instigation of its American masters, the French reactionary groups began to carry out activities to amend the electoral law and conspire to exclude the Communist Party from parliament in the autumn of 1950.

On May 7, 1951, the National Assembly, with the resolute opposition of Communist Party members, passed the anti-democratic "Majority Alliance Electoral Law," and then on May 12 passed a decision to advance the general election, which was originally scheduled to be held in October, to June 17.

According to the provisions of this electoral law, if the alliance formed by the various reactionary parties in France obtains more than 50 percent of the votes in an electoral district, it can win all the seats, while the French Communist Party and other parties, even if they obtain 49.9 percent of the votes, will still not get a single seat.

According to the provisions of this electoral law, the method of electing members of parliament in proportion to the population of each province, which had been implemented after the war, was also abolished, and replaced by the anti-democratic method of electing an equal number of members of parliament per province, regardless of the size of the population. This was to arbitrarily deprive the Communist Party of some seats that it should have obtained in the northern and central provinces where the working class was concentrated.

According to the provisions of this electoral law, each party can also freely form alliances in some electoral districts and not form alliances in other electoral districts; if no party or alliance obtains more than 50 percent of the votes in some electoral districts, seats will still be distributed according to the "proportional representation system." This also greatly helps the reactionaries.

As a result of the implementation of the anti-democratic electoral law, in this general election, although the French Communist Party received the most votes in many provinces, it did not get a single seat. In total, although the French Communist Party received the most votes in the country, it was arbitrarily robbed of dozens of seats by the reactionaries due to the anti-democratic "election arithmetic." As a result of the election, the French Communist Party received more than five million votes but only obtained 103 seats; De Gaulle's "French People's Alliance" received more than three million votes but obtained 121 seats.

The passage and implementation of the anti-democratic "Majority Alliance Electoral Law" marks the further fascistization of French elections. The sole purpose of this electoral law is to deprive the French Communist Party of its seats and conspire to exclude the French Communist Party from parliament, in order to pave the way for the fascist De Gaulle to come to power, so that he can drive the French people to serve as cannon fodder for the American war of aggression.

Tragic France, under the rule of the French bourgeoisie, has abandoned the grand slogans of "democracy" and "freedom" put forward in the era of the Great Revolution and embarked on the road of fascistization.

                                    ×    ×    ×

This is the election situation in those bourgeois countries that claim to be "most democratic." Facts have proven that the democratic electoral system of "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" has never been truly realized in these countries. In these countries, although the Constitution formally confers the right of universal suffrage to "all the people" in a grandiose manner, the electoral law in fact restricts the exercise of this right, and even completely nullifies it. As for fascist countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy before World War II, it goes without saying.

The facts are just as Lenin said: "Bourgeois democracy, although it has a great historical progressive role compared to the medieval system, is always—and cannot but be under capitalism—narrow, incomplete, hypocritical, and sanctimonious democracy" (Lenin Selected Works, Moscow Chinese edition, 1949, Vol. 2, p. 438), and just as Stalin said: "Democracy in capitalist countries with antagonistic classes is, in the final analysis, democracy enjoyed by the powerful, democracy enjoyed by the propertied minority." (Problems of Leninism, Moscow Chinese edition, 1949, p. 690) Under the conditions of bourgeois rule, the universal suffrage system formally declared in the constitution is nothing more than a shameless deception of the broad masses of working people.

This is because: the bourgeoisie is afraid of the masses of the people, especially afraid that workers and farmers will use universal suffrage to oppose the bourgeois dictatorship and to oppose the system of exploitation of man by man. The very nature of bourgeois rule determines that it must inevitably embark on the road of imperialism and embark on the road of fascistization.

Comrade Stalin once said: "In the past, the bourgeoisie chanted liberalism and defended bourgeois-democratic freedoms, thereby establishing prestige for itself among the people. Now, there is not even a shadow of liberalism. ... The banner of bourgeois-democratic freedom has been thrown aside," "In the past, the bourgeoisie was regarded as the leader of the nation; it defended the rights and independence of the nation, placing the rights and independence of the nation 'above everything else.' Now, there is not even a shadow of the 'national principle.' Now, the bourgeoisie sells out the rights and independence of the nation in exchange for US dollars. The banner of national independence and national sovereignty has been thrown aside." (Speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union)

The history of elections in bourgeois countries illustrates the hypocrisy and deception of bourgeois "democracy," and the electoral system currently implemented in bourgeois countries shows that these countries have torn off their hypocritical masks and openly embarked on the old road of fascism.

    资本主义国家选举制度的虚伪性
    王之相  李祖荫  张尚鷟
    谈到普选，人们常常容易想到“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”这句口号。苏联在斯大林宪法实施以后，才在人类历史上第一次实现了和这一口号底内容完全符合的彻底民主的普选。我们的选举法所规定的选举制度，和苏联的选举制度是属于同一体系的，因为，我们的新民主主义政权将引导着我国走向社会主义前途，走向彻底实现“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的全民民主的选举底前途。
    我们的选举制度是和任何资本主义国家所曾实行过和正在实行着的那种形式的、虚伪的、欺骗的选举制度根本不能比拟的。
    “普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”这句口号，本来是资产阶级在反对封建统治和专制主义时代提出的政治口号。然而，资产阶级虽然提出了这一“进步的”口号，却根本不可能实现它。百余年来的历史证明：在资产阶级统治的条件下，从来没有实现过“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的彻底民主的选举。
                            ×    ×    ×
    让我们首先来看看美国——这个一向自称为最“民主”、今天且自封为所谓“自由世界”与“民主国家”领袖的国家。
    在美国，宪法规定“赋予”全体公民以“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的选举权利，并宣告说：不能因种族、肤色、性别等关系而剥夺任何公民的投票权。然而事实上，美国宪法却只是资产阶级用以欺骗和统治广大人民的工具，它所规定的公民权利，只是一纸空文而已。
    许多州的法律对于选举规定了财产上的限制：佐治亚州规定只有拥有四十英亩土地或具备缴纳三百元捐税能力的选民，才能投票；亚拉巴马州和密士失必州规定只有缴纳了相当数量的人头税并能提出收据作证明的选民，才能参加选举；南部有七个州的法律规定必须缴纳选举税才能投票；全国有十三个州的法律规定赤贫者以及领取国家救济金的选民没有投票权。由于这类财产条件的限制，千百万劳动人民因此不能享受宪法所赋予的选举权利。
    美国各州的法律都规定着对于选举所加的“居住期间”的限制（各州不等，大体是从三个月到二年）。这种限制，使数百万的旅行者、季节性工人以及流浪失业者失掉参加选举的机会。在一九四八年的大选中，就有二百万选民因居住期间不够、三百五十万选民因在旅行途中而不能参加选举。
    许多州的法律都规定了“教育程度”及“提供各种证据和文件”的限制。有些州要选民证明自己能以英语诵读宪法条文并书写自己的姓名以后，才许参加投票；有些州则要求选民在选举前参加关于 “教育程度”的测验，只有及格者，才能参加选举。
    许多州的法律规定着关于“宗教信仰”和“职业”的限制，例如北卡罗来纳州就规定“无神论者”不得参加选举。另外有二十九州的法律则规定士兵和水手没有选举权。
    像这类的限制，即使根据美国官方自己公布的材料来看，也有五十余种之多。
    在美国，妇女是直到一九二○年才取得在名义上与男子平等的选举权利的。
    在这里，民族和种族的歧视使千百万黑种人、犹太人、斯拉夫人、东方民族以及土著的印第安人丧失了宪法所赋予的投票权。
    占美国人口总数十分之一的黑人，所受到的待遇是最悲惨的。财产条件、居住期间、教育程度等各种各样的限制凑在一起，结果，就只有个别的黑人才能享受到选举的权利。南方各州法律中所规定的财产条件，是大部分黑人所不可能具备的。在有“教育程度”限制的那些州里，举行识字和文化水平测验时，白人测验员常故意要求黑人回答像“宪法第五条规定的是什么？”“美国第四任总统是谁？”之类的难题。谁都知道，像这样的考试，在不注意政治的美国人民中间，甚至就连很多受过完备教育的白人也是很难及格的。
    在这里，资产阶级玩弄着巧妙的选举把戏，利用各色各式的“选举技术”来保证华尔街大亨在选举中的胜利。许多州的法律规定限制进步的党派提出候选人，例如伊利诺斯州的法律就规定在上届大选中不曾在该州获得一百万选票的政党没有提出候选人的资格。在一九四八年的大选中，进步党就由于这种限制，在许多州内都没有能提出自己的候选人。
    在这里，口头上说国会议员和总统都由选民“直接”选举，实际上，选民却只能选举出“投票人”，然后由这些“投票人”在复选中去选举总统与国会议员。
    在这里，口头上说进行的是“秘密投票”，实际上，由于两党（“共和党”和“民主党”）党棍们操纵着选举，依照美国一位著名教授吉丁斯的说法，美国向来就“只有百分之五的选民能自由地投票”。
    第二次世界大战以后，在杜鲁门统治下，美国公开地走上了法西斯的道路，选举也就跟着完全法西斯化了。
    党棍和党魁们控制着各地的选举机构，他们用各种各样非法的手段为自己的候选人搜罗选票。和华尔街集团有着密切联系的纽约州州长杜威是拥护提名艾森豪威尔为总统候选人的。在共和党投票人的一次集会上，他意味深长地告诉那些代表们说：“我还要当两年半州长，而我的记性是很好的。”他警告那些不投艾森豪威尔的票的人说，如果投票投得“不恰当”，再过两天，当大会结束以后他们回到家里去时，“将会发现他们的亲友已经不在原来的职位上了”。威胁、利诱、造谣、诽谤、非法免职的要挟，以及无故殴打、监禁，甚至杀害选民和投票人的事件，在竞选运动中每天都发生着。
    另一方面，法西斯分子则肆无忌惮地阻挠并破坏进步党候选人的竞选活动。在一九五二年的总统选举中，掌握在垄断资本家手中的报纸，对于民主党与共和党候选人的每一句话都大吹大擂，对进步党候选人发表的谈话却只字不提；杜鲁门政府控制着电台，不让进步党候选人发表广播演说；法西斯徒棍们则到处进行诽谤、利用政治迫害与警察恐怖来阻挠并破坏进步党进行竞选宣传；最后，当选举前夕，还散布出各种各样的恐怖流言，借以阻止大批选民和投票人去投进步党总统候选人哈利南和巴斯夫人的票。
    对于选举所加的各种各样的限制，以及在选举中所造成的愈来愈厉害的法西斯恐怖，使宪法所赋予美国公民的“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的选举权利在事实上完全化为乌有。每数年一次的选举，在美国，业已变成了资产阶级“民主”的点缀。
    根据美国官方发表的数字，在一九四四年进行总统选举时，全国八千八百余万选民里面，有四千八百万人因为各种限制的缘故没有参加投票；一九四六年的国会改选，只有百分之三十八的选民去投票；一九四八年进行总统选举时，在全国九千四百万选民中，又有四千四百万人因各种限制而不能参加选举。结果，杜鲁门在这次选举中仅获二千四百万票（约为选民总数的四分之一，全国人口总数一亿五千万的六分之一），就当选为总统；一九五○年的国会改选，有百分之五十六的选民不能参加投票；一九五二年进行总统选举时，艾森豪威尔以三千三百零二万多票，就当选了总统。
                                    ×    ×    ×
    其次，我们再来看看英国。
    在英国过去和现在的选举制度中，我们随处都能看到各种对于“普遍、平等”的民主的选举原则的限制与破坏。
    首先，财产条件，就是对广大无产者的选举权和被选举权的剥夺。
    从亨利第六时代起，一直到一九一八年为止，历次的选举法都明文规定了选举权的取得以有一定财产条件为基础。正因为如此，从一八八四年到一九一八年公布新选举法时为止，据统计，每次选举，总有二百万左右的成年男子（当然主要是工人与农民），不能参加选举。
    一九一八年的选举法，虽然取消了以前关于财产条件的赤裸裸的限制，却又换上了一些性质相同只不过掩饰得比较巧妙的新规定。一九一八年选举法中的许多规定，到今天依然是有效的。
    这个选举法规定了取得选举权的“住所资格”：必须在某一选区居住六个月以上才能登记为该区选民——谁都知道，大多数劳动人民、特别是工人，是无法有固定住所的。
    另外，这个选举法还规定：只要因职业、营业、经营交易所等关系而占有价值在十镑以上的土地或其他住所时，就可登记为该土地或住所所在区的选民。
    前一条规定的目的在剥夺无产者的投票权，后一条规定的目的则在赋予有产者以两个投票权。一九三一年，伦敦享有这种第二票投票权的选民共有十三万七千七百三十一人，在某一银行与大企业集中的选区中，选民名册上载有四万四千人，而实际上在这里有住所而又达到选举年龄的人口不过七千左右，其余三万七千人，就是因为他们在这一区中拥有营业、银行、房产和土地等财产而获得第二票投票权的。
    这就是资产阶级式的“民主”！正如列宁所说的一样，它“对于富者为天堂，对于贫人和被剥削者为陷阱为骗局”（一九四九年莫斯科中文版“列宁文选”第二卷第四三八页）。
    其次，是年龄、职业、教育程度等等的限制。
    在英国，征兵法规定满十八岁的公民就应服兵役，但选举法却规定须满二十一岁才能参加选举。
    在英国，法律规定公职人员不能参加竞选，要竞选就必须辞掉职务。同时，数十万现正服兵役的军人被禁止参加任何政治活动。
    在英国，曾受高等教育的人们，由于取得大学学位的缘故，在议会选举时，也可以享受两次投票权
    （在自己的住所区投一票；在大学选区投另一票），而没有一定财产条件，不能享受高等教育的劳动人民，则连投一次票的机会也没有。
    再次，是男女间的不平等和种族间的不平等。
    英国妇女是直到一九一八年才第一次获得选举权与被选举权的。在这以前，占人口半数的妇女，全部无权参加选举。就在一九一八年的选举法中，男女不平等的状况仍被部分地保留下来：男子只需满二十一岁，而妇女却必须满三十岁才能参加选举。
    此外，从编造选民名册、计算选票到选举结束，在整个选举过程中，资产阶级还常常利用选举工作中的细节，来进行无耻的欺骗；通过每一个选举工作的细节，来破坏“普遍、平等”的民主原则。事实证明：每一个选举工作的细节，实际上都具有极大的政治意义。
    在战后几次大选的选举运动中，战争贩子们公开限制共产党和劳动人民的竞选活动。他们操纵着全国的宣传武器，不予共产党以利用电台作竞选广播的机会，只是在经过英共总书记波立特的抗议以后，才勉强允许分配给英共以八分半钟的广播时间，但只允许讲一次，并且故意安排在下午六时十五
    分工人正忙于工作无法收听的时间。正像一个作家所写的一样，这八分半钟只不过是“英国民主的装饰”！在一九五○年的大选前，工党政府曾宣布伦敦区禁止游行三个月。此外，还经常以各种借口拒绝租借可供公共集会的场所给共产党召开选举大会。州长、市长们则控制着选举机构，无耻地违反
    “秘密投票”的民主原则，派人将投票人的登记号码记在选票存根上，借以追查投票人的政治态度。一个工党拉票员威胁着要把一名妇女投票人从当地工党委员会所建造的房屋中赶出去，因为她不愿投工党候选人的票。一个保守党的地主辞退了几个工人，因为他听到这些工人说他们不喜欢邱吉尔。天主教的牧师们则扬言，凡投共产党票的教民，就要被开除教籍。像这类的例子，在全国各地都可碰到。
    战争贩子们就是这样利用选举工作中的每一个细节，来进行欺骗威吓的。
    今天，英国人民已丧失了那怕是受到极大限制的
    一点点民主权利，资产阶级业已完全抛弃了“自由”与“民主”的旗帜，出卖英国民族利益的保守党与工党已使整个英国变成了为美国战争政策服务的工具。今天，“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的民主的选举原则，在英国已被破坏无遗。选举制度的日益法西斯化，预示着资产阶级统治的行将灭亡。
    这就是英国过去和现在的选举情况。
                                    ×    ×    ×
    最后，我们来看看法国。
    历史上，法国资产阶级曾打起“自由”“民主”的旗帜，高唱过“天赋人权”的口号。一七八九年的“人权宣言”并将“人生而享有自由平等的权利”也订成了法律。然而，一旦资产阶级夺得了政权，他们立刻就背叛了自己的誓言。
        一七九一年的宪法、一八一七年的选举法、一八三一年的法律，都对选举权加上了年龄、性别与财产资格的限制。
        一八七一年巴黎公社在人类历史上第一次建立了劳动人民自己的政权。“普选”在人类历史上才第
    一次变做了摧毁资产阶级议会制度和组织工人阶级政权的工具。公社失败以后，资产阶级建立了法兰西第三共和国。在这里，又恢复了他们自己的违反民主原则的选举制度。
        一八七五年的选举法规定：年满二十一岁的法国“男子”，均有选举权，但享受被选举的权利，却必须满二十五岁。除此以外，这个选举法还规定：军人不能参加选举；支领国库薪俸的官员也不能兼任议员。
    这种年龄、职业、居住期间的限制，直到今天，仍然存在。正因为如此，所以在法国本土现有的四千二百万人口中，至今仍有半数以上的人民享受不到选举的权利。
    妇女与男子享受同等的选举权利，是迟至第二次世界大战以后，才开始实现的。在这以前，一九一三年时大多数议员还否决过“妇女参加选举”的提案，一九一九年选举议案中本来有两条关于妇女选举的规定，也被大多数议员否决。占人口半数的法国妇女是在一九四六年的第四共和国宪法中，才取得与男子完全平等的选举权利。
    法国的资产阶级，如同英国的资产阶级一样，也利用选举工作中的每一个细节，来进行操纵、破坏的勾当。
    在一九三二年的选举中，巴黎资产阶级选民占多数的第一选举区是八千选民选议员一人；而无产阶级选民占多数，座落在城郊的哥拜尔选举区却是五万选民选议员一人。结果，就保证了资产阶级在国民议会中“合法地”取得比工人更多的席位。在这一年的选举中，共产党共得八十万选票，只得到十二个议席，而资产阶级的激进社会党共得一百八十五万选票（比共产党多一倍强），却得到了一百五十七个议席（比共产党多十二倍）。
    第二次世界大战以后，由于整个欧洲的民主势力大大加强，又由于共产党的坚持不懈的斗争，一九四六年，才实行了比较民主的“比例代表制”的选举制度，按各政党在选区中所得到的票数的比例，分配其在国民议会中应得的席次。在资产阶级统治的条件下，这当然是比较民主的制度，因为它能保证
    一切政治倾向的选民在议会中都有自己的代表。正因为如此，在这次大选中，法国共产党由于得到将近六百万张选票（全部选票的三分之一），在国民议会全部六百二十七个议席中，就获得了一百六十六席，变成了国民议会中第一个大党。
    法国共产党及其支持者在国民议会中占据将近三分之一议席的事实，法国共产党在议会内外坚持不懈地为保卫法国人民利益、保卫和平、保卫法国民族的自由独立而斗争的事实，不能不使华尔街的老板们及其走卒之一——法国的反动派震惊。为使法国国民议会能更顺从地听命于美国，在美国主子的唆使下，从一九五○年秋天开始，法国各反动集团就开始了进行修改选举法，阴谋将共产党排斥于议会之外的阴谋活动。
    一九五一年五月七日，国民议会在共产党议员的坚决反对下，通过了反民主的“多数联盟选举法”，并接着于五月十二日通过了决定，将原应在十月举行的大选提前到六月十七日举行。
    按照这个选举法的规定，法国各反动党派结成的联盟，如果在一个选区中得到百分之五十以上的选票，便可夺得所有的全部议席，而法共和其他党派，即使获得了百分之四十九·九的选票，仍一个议席也得不到。
    按照这个选举法的规定，战后一度实现过的按各省人口比例选举议员的办法也被废止，而代之以反民主的不问人口多寡每省选出同等数目的议员的办法。这是为了要在北部和中部工人阶级集中的省份，蛮横地剥夺掉共产党原应获得的若干议席。
    按照这个选举法的规定，各党派还可随意在某些选区中结盟，在另一些选区中则不结盟；在某些选区中如果没有任何党派或联盟获得百分之五十以上的选票，则仍按“比例代表制”分配议席。这也大大地帮助着反动派。
    由于反民主的选举法施行的结果，在这次大选中，法国共产党虽然在许多省区得票最多，却一个议席也没得到。总计起来，虽然法共在全国得票最多，却因为反民主的“选举算术”，蛮横地被反动派劫去了数十个议席。选举的结果，法共得票五百多万张，只获得一百零三个议席；戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”得票三百余万张，却获得了一百二十一席。
    反民主的“多数联盟选举法”的通过与实施，标志着法国选举进一步走向法西斯化。这个选举法的唯一目的，就在于剥夺法共的议席，阴谋将法共排斥于议会之外，以便为法西斯分子戴高乐的上台铺平道路，好让他驱使法国人民去为美国的侵略战争充当炮灰。
    悲惨的法兰西，在法国资产阶级统治下，业已抛弃了大革命时代冠冕堂皇地提出的“民主”“自由”的口号，走上了法西斯化的道路。
                                    ×    ×    ×
    这就是那些号称“最民主”的资产阶级国家的选举情况。事实证明：这些国家里从未真正实现过“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的民主的选举制度。在这些国家里，尽管宪法冠冕堂皇地在形式上赋予“全体人民”以普选的权利，而选举法则在事实上限制着这种权利的行使，甚至把它全部化为乌有。至于在像第二次世界大战前的日、德、意这类法西斯国家里，当然更不消说了。
    事实正如列宁所说：“资产阶级的民主制较之中世纪制度虽有伟大的历史进步作用，但它始终是——而且在资本主义之下不能不是——狭窄的，残缺的，虚伪的，假仁假义的民主”（一九四九年莫斯科中文版“列宁文选”第二卷第四三八页），也正如斯大林所说：“民主在有彼此对抗阶级的资本主义国家中，归根到底是供有势力者享受的民主，是供有财产的少数人享受的民主”。（一九四九年莫斯科中文版“列宁主义问题”第六九○页）在资产阶级统治的条件下，宪法上形式地宣布的普选制度只不过是对广大劳动人民所进行的无耻的欺骗。
    这是因为：资产阶级害怕人民大众，特别是害怕工人和农民会利用普选来反对资产阶级专政，来反对人剥削人的制度。资产阶级统治的本身，决定着它必然地要走向帝国主义的道路，走上法西斯化的道路。
    斯大林同志曾说过：“从前，资产阶级高唱自由主义，维护资产阶级——民主的自由，从而在人民中间为它自己树立了威望。现在，连一点自由主义的影子也没有了。……资产阶级——民主的自由这种旗帜已经被抛在一边了”，“从前，资产阶级被当作是民族的领袖；它维护民族的权利和独立，把民族的权利与独立放在‘高于一切’的地位上。现在，连一点‘民族原则’的影子也没有了。现在，资产阶级出卖民族的权利和独立来换取美元。民族独立和民族主权的旗帜已经被抛在一边了。”（在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说）
    资产阶级国家选举的历史说明了资产阶级“民主”的虚伪性与欺骗性，资产阶级国家今天所实行着的选举制度说明着这些国家已扯下虚伪的面具，公开地走上法西斯的老路了。
