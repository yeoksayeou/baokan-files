    Japanese Progressive Painters, Mr. and Mrs. Maruki’s
    “Hiroshima Panels” Win International Peace Prize
    [Xinhua News Agency] According to Japan's "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper: "Hiroshima Panels," a work by Japanese progressive painters Iri and Toshi Maruki depicting the disaster caused by the atomic bombing, has been selected as an outstanding work by the World Peace Council's International Peace Prize Committee and will receive the 1952 International Peace Prize.
    After learning that she and her husband had won the award, Toshi Maruki humbly and earnestly said: "We are merely painters who have done our best to paint. Thanks to everyone's efforts in showing these paintings to many people, a belief in peace has been generated among the masses, and that is why we received the prize. Therefore, this gold medal is one that we all have won." She also expressed that she would continue to work hard and contribute her strength to peace in the future.
    In order to celebrate this glory of the Maruki couple, the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party wrote a letter to them expressing congratulations, saying: "The fact that 'Hiroshima Panels' has won the 1952 International Peace Prize is something that the majority of the Japanese people who hope for peace and are determined not to repeat the tragedy of the atomic bomb feel happy and honored about. The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party is determined to devote itself to implementing the resolutions of the World People's Peace Congress into the peace movement of all Japanese people, and hopes that the two of you will work hard at painting and make further efforts for the victory of peace."

    日本进步画家丸木夫妇的作品
    “原子弹之画”荣获国际和平奖
     【新华社讯】据日本“赤旗报”讯：日本进步画家丸木位里和赤松俊子夫妇所作的描绘原子弹轰炸所造成的灾害的“原子弹之画”，已被世界和平理事会的国际和平奖金评议委员会评选为优秀作品，获得一九五二年的国际和平奖。
    赤松俊子在他们夫妇的作品得奖后谦逊而恳切地说：“我们不过是作为画家以最大的努力从事绘画罢了。由于大家的努力，把这些画给许多人观看，在群众中间产生了对于和平的信念，才得了奖。所以，这个金奖章是我们大家获得的。”她并表示今后要继续努力，为和平贡献出自己的力量。
    日本共产党中央指导部为了庆祝丸木夫妇的这一光荣，写信给他们表示祝贺说：“原子弹之画”获得一九五二年国际和平奖一事，是希望和平和决心不再重演原子弹悲剧的大多数日本人民同感欣喜和光荣的。日本共产党中央指导部决心献身于把世界人民和平大会的决议贯彻到日本全体人民的和平运动中，希望你俩努力绘画，为和平的胜利作进一步的奋斗。
