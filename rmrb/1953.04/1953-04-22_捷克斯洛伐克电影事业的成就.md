    Achievements of Czechoslovak Cinema
    By Mi Fabera, Head of the Delegation of Czechoslovak Film Artists
    In the past seven years, People's Democratic Czechoslovakia has produced nearly one hundred and forty films. Half of them serve the cause of socialist construction. An important task of Czechoslovak cinema is the transformation of people.
    The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has always given special care and attention to the development of Czechoslovak film art. The great help that the late President and beloved Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Comrade Klement Gottwald, gave to Czechoslovak film art is unforgettable. Comrade Gottwald watched every new film. His criticisms and instructions were the best help for Czechoslovak film artists. The current President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Comrade Antonín Zápotocký, also helps the film industry in the same way. Comrade Zápotocký himself is an excellent writer. Because of his integrity, frankness, and special talent, he can offer the most incisive criticisms that inspire those criticized and are loved by the people of Czechoslovakia.
    The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia's help to the film industry is not limited to the various instructions of the Party leaders. In April 1950, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia also made a resolution on the tasks of Czechoslovak film creation, which laid a solid foundation for all activities of Czechoslovak cinema.
    The resolution stated: Czechoslovak film art should, with its broad mass character, victoriously complete the great and lofty mission entrusted to our People's Democratic Republic, which is marching towards socialism under the leadership of the Party. Czechoslovak film art should take the film art of the great Soviet Union as an example and play an important role in the cause of educating new, conscious citizens and educating selfless socialist builders. Our people love their free motherland, and they are always firmly defending it from enemy invasion, and maintaining unbreakable, deep friendship with the Soviet people, the people's democracies, and the progressive forces of the world.
    The resolution put forward such tasks for Czechoslovak films: to clearly and artistically persuasively express their great ideas, to become true and fascinating works with profound humanity and easy to understand, to be able to inspire and move the broad masses of people of all strata in our country, to conquer the hearts and minds of the audience, to give them invincible optimism and confidence in the camp of peace and democracy, and to call on all honest citizens of the Czechoslovak Republic to participate in the cause of realizing the great ideals of socialism.
    The resolution pointed out to Czechoslovak film art: to take Soviet film art, which has a high degree of ideology, Party spirit, and artistic skill, as an example. Because Soviet film art shows the beauty of socialist life, reflects the way of thinking of the Soviet people, consolidates the spiritual and political unity of all nationalities, and mobilizes all the strength of the people to build communism. The resolution clearly stated: Soviet film art has won the love and praise of the working people of the world, especially our people, with these characteristics. Soviet films are a permanent and great force in helping our people build socialism.
    The resolution of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is a great help to the work of Czechoslovak artists. Furthermore, since the promulgation of the resolution, the struggle to achieve its full realization has continued. Creators are constantly raising the requirements for their films. Creators, together with the Party organizations and all workers engaged in the film industry, are cooperating to strive for the highest degree of ideology and artistic skill.
    In 1952, Czechoslovak cinema completed nineteen films. Twenty-two art films will be produced in 1953. The film "Tomorrow Everywhere is Joyful Song and Dance," directed by V. Volchick, which won the Stalin Prize, is one of the most outstanding films completed during this period. This film was screened at the Czechoslovak Film Festival held in the Soviet Union on April 13, 1951, and will also be screened at the closing ceremony of the Czechoslovak Film Week held in China.
    Czechoslovak cinema faces the following tasks: to continue to improve its level, never be satisfied with the achievements already made, to accelerate the process of color film work, and to strive for maximum economy.
    Secondly, we must strive to make Czechoslovak film art more frequently address current issues and help people solve these issues. Therefore, we will keep film playwrights and directors in close contact with our people who are building socialism. At the same time, we must continue to care for creative workers, so that they can master Marxism-Leninism, study Stalin's recent brilliant works on the economic problems of socialism in the Soviet Union, and study the reports and resolutions of the glorious 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    The work of Czechoslovak creators is not without shortcomings, and we must continue to improve.
    The purpose of the film exhibitions held in the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is to promote cultural exchange and friendly relations between our fraternal countries. If the work of Czechoslovak filmmakers can help the great and heroic Chinese people who are enthusiastically building a strong new China, they will be very happy.

    捷克斯洛伐克电影事业的成就
    捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术工作者代表团团长  米·法贝拉
    最近七年来，人民民主捷克斯洛伐克曾经摄制了近一百四十部影片。其中有一半是为社会主义建设事业服务的。捷克斯洛伐克电影事业的重要任务，是改造人的事业。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党一贯对捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术的发展，给予特殊的关怀和注意。不久以前逝世的总统、为人民所爱戴的捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志所给予捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术的那种伟大的帮助，是令人难忘的。哥特瓦尔德同志看过每一部新的影片。他的批评和指示是对捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术工作者的最好的帮助。捷克斯洛伐克共和国现任总统安托宁·萨波托斯基同志也同样地帮助电影事业。萨波托斯基同志自己就是一位优秀的作家。由于他的正直、坦白和特殊的才能，他能提出足以鼓舞被批评者并为捷克斯洛伐克全国人民所喜爱的、最尖锐的批评。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党对于电影事业的帮助，不仅限于党的领袖的各种指示，而且，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团在一九五○年四月还曾对捷克斯洛伐克电影创作的任务作出过决议，这个决议奠定了捷克斯洛伐克电影事业全部活动的牢固基础。
    决议中说：捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术，应以广大的群众性，来胜利地完成在党所领导下的、正在走向社会主义的我们人民民主共和国所赋予的伟大而崇高的使命。捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术应以伟大苏联的电影艺术为榜样，在教育新的、自觉的公民的事业中，在教育那些忘我的社会主义建设者的事业中，应该起重要的作用。我国人民热爱自己的自由祖国，他们在任何时候都十分坚决地保卫祖国免受敌人的侵袭，并和苏联人民、各人民民主国家以及全世界进步力量保持着牢不可破的、深厚的友好联系。
    决议给捷克斯洛伐克电影提出了这样的任务：要清晰地、具有艺术说服力地表现自己的伟大思想，要成为真实而引人入胜的、具有深刻人性的和容易理解的作品，要能够激发和感动我国各阶层的广大人民，要征服观众的心和思想，使他们对和平民主阵营具有必胜的乐观主义和信心，要号召捷克斯洛伐克共和国全体正直的公民参加实现社会主义伟大理想的事业。
    决议向捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术指出：要把具有高度思想性、党性和艺术技巧的苏联电影艺术做为榜样。因为苏联的电影艺术表现出社会主义生活的美满，反映出苏联人民的思想方式，巩固着各族人民精神上和政治上的团结一致，并动员人民的全部力量去建设共产主义。决议中明确地说：苏联的电影艺术以这些特点赢得了全世界劳动人民，特别是我国人民的热爱和赞美，苏联的影片是帮助我国人民建设社会主义的永久的、伟大的力量。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团的决议，对于捷克斯洛伐克艺术家的工作是一种巨大的帮助。此外，自决议颁布到现在，为争取它的全部实现的斗争仍在继续着。创作工作者们不断地提高着对自己影片的要求。创作工作者和共同从事于电影事业的党组织与一切劳动者共同合作，为争取最高度的思想性和艺术技巧而斗争。
    一九五二年，捷克斯洛伐克电影事业完成了十九部影片。一九五三年将出品二十二部艺术影片。荣获斯大林奖金的符·伏尔契克所导演的影片“明天处处欢乐歌舞”，就是这个期间所完成的最卓越的影片之一。这部影片已于一九五一年四月十三日在苏联举办的捷克斯洛伐克电影节上演过，也将在中国举办的捷克斯洛伐克电影周的闭幕典礼上演出。
    在捷克斯洛伐克电影事业面前有着这样一些任务：要继续提高它的水平，绝不能满足于已得的成就，要加速彩色影片工作的过程，并为争取最大的节约而斗争。
    其次，必须争取使捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术更经常地涉及当前的问题，并帮助人们去解决这些问题。因此，我们将使电影剧作家和导演与正在建设社会主义的我国人民保持最密切的联系。同时，也要不断地关怀创作工作者，使他们掌握马克思列宁主义，学习斯大林关于苏联社会主义经济问题的最近的天才著作，并要学习光荣的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的报告和决议。
    捷克斯洛伐克创作工作者们的工作并不是没有缺点的，我们还要继续改进。
    在苏联和中华人民共和国举办的电影展览，目的是在促进我们与兄弟国家之间的文化交流与友好联系。如果捷克斯洛伐克电影工作者的工作有助于正在热情地建设着强大新中国的伟大英勇的中国人民，他们将是很幸福的。
