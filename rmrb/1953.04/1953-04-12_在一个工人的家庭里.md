    In a Worker's Family
    Soviet Union Ba. Kuznetsov
    I
    It was already evening when the radio in the rolling mill of the "Hammer and Sickle" factory broadcast the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on further price reductions. People couldn't help but gather together, wholeheartedly talking about their joy and their life plans.

    That evening, everyone was filled with a heroic feeling. It was a feeling of pride in their beloved socialist motherland, and a feeling of great satisfaction with the Party and the government's decision to reduce prices.

    Worker Leonid Vorobyov expressed this feeling in simple and sincere words:

    "We workers wholeheartedly dedicate all our strength to the motherland and to the Communist Party. And our Party, our dear government, wholeheartedly cares for the people. The indestructible strength of our motherland lies in the close unity of the people, the Party, and the government!"

    Many heartfelt thoughts were expressed at the workshop meeting. Life has undergone wonderful changes, and it is becoming better, more beautiful, and richer every day.

    Leonid Vorobyov has worked in the factory for forty years. He took over his father's job in this very workshop. Leonid Vorobyov's son also works in the factory, representing the third generation of an ordinary metallurgical worker's family in Moscow.

    Our people have endured many tests. In the era of drastically destroying everything old left to us by capitalism, we also experienced many difficulties and hardships. But the Communist Party and the Soviet regime brought new life, like crystal-clear water flowing into the hot desert, pushing life forward with its invincible power.

    Our cities and villages were burned in the cruel flames of war provoked by the fascist aggressors, and many of them were turned into ashes. The Soviet people heroically defended the honor, freedom, and independence of their beloved motherland, enduring countless sacrifices and losses! Is this a long time ago? Not long ago, and yet how far we have advanced, built, and become stronger. Life gets better year by year, and the goal we pursue—communism—is getting closer. Our happiness lies here."

    At the evening gathering, the rolling mill workers spoke warmly and kindly about the Communist Party and the Soviet government, which constantly care for the people's welfare. The night shift workers enthusiastically took on the task of overproducing dozens of tons of rolled iron beyond the plan.

    II
    In Leonid Vorobyov's family, they don't particularly like to reminisce about the past. Old Fyodor Vorobyov worked for forty years in the factory owner Gurohn's factory in the Rogozh district. On his deathbed, he still complained to his sons:

    "This kind of life is hell! It's like I lived my whole life, but it's like I never lived at all. No matter how much I worked, I still ended up in debt."

    Fyodor's son, Leonid Vorobyov, also suffered from the oppression of life under the capitalist system. The hereditary metallurgical workers did everything they could before the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, but they still couldn't escape poverty and debt.

    At that time, in the factory, Gurohn opened an open-air shop for the workers. This capitalist store did business like this: no matter how frugal people were, their wages were never enough. The capitalist Gurohn cruelly exploited the workers, and the prices of goods in the store were very high, but there was really no other way, because the speculators in the factory wouldn't let other competitors come near the factory. People toiled from six in the morning to six in the evening, how could they have time to think about distant markets where things were cheaper, so they had to buy what was at hand!

    Today, the Vorobyov family painfully recalls all of this. They recall these things not only because they appreciate the joy of the glorious changes in our Soviet life, and rationally and personally feel the greatness of these achievements. They also recall these things because there are still many Gurohns outside our country who advocate war, squeeze the last bit of energy out of workers' families, and subject millions of workers to unemployment, poverty, and hunger.

    III
    The financial situation of the rolling mill worker Leonid Vorobyov's family is no different from that of thousands of other worker families. The Vorobyov family has meat, fish, oil, milk, vegetables, white bread, sugar, pastries, tea, and other foods every day. Five price reductions have improved the material welfare of this family year after year.

    Leonid Fedorovich subscribes to pictorials and newspapers and buys works by classical writers. He often goes to the theater or movies with his whole family.

    In 1952, the Vorobyov family's total wage income reached more than 32,000 rubles.

    Vorobyov's eldest son lives separately. He has received specialized education and is now an electrical technician. His daughter has graduated from a ten-year school, and his grandson is supported by the state and is studying in elementary school. Like many of his comrades in the factory, this old worker goes to the best sanatoriums in the country every year during his vacation. All of this, which was unattainable under the capitalist system, has become commonplace for Soviet workers. The new price reductions have brought significant benefits to the Moscow rolling mill worker's family finances. On the first day of selling goods at the new prices, the busy and diligent housewife, Anisiya Kabitonovna, bought more with the family's daily allowance than ever before.

    The family saw her carrying a new leather handbag, full of vegetables, apples, and oranges. That day, she also bought premium fish, sauce, a kilogram of fatty beef, a package of butter, and a package of sugar.

    "I decided to buy this bigger and sturdier handbag because the old one was a bit small, not quite enough!" the hostess joked, "Also, this handbag saved me the price of a kilogram and a half of sugar at the new prices."

    According to the rolling mill worker Vorobyov's simple calculations, his family, including his wife, daughter, and grandson, can save about five hundred rubles per month after the new price reductions.

    These hundreds of new rubles saved by this worker's family are imperceptibly accumulated every day in daily necessities. Because everything is cheaper: whether it's daily food or industrial products.

    "Little things add up, this new price reduction will benefit my family almost six thousand rubles a year. With this money, I can buy a radiofax, an electric refrigerator, a men's suit, two pieces of silk fabric, three pairs of the latest style leather shoes, a child's bicycle, and two coats!" the old worker calculated.

    The discussions in the rolling mill worker Leonid Vorobyov's family showed the greatest significance of the resolutions passed by the Party and the government. The ordinary people of the Soviet Union deeply understand this, and they feel in this decision the fatherly concern of the beloved Communist Party and the Soviet government for the people's urgent needs, and for meeting the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the whole society. This concern is felt not only by the family of worker Leonid Vorobyov, but also by the families of hundreds of thousands of workers, peasants, and staff members in our bright and vast motherland. Millions of Soviet people are repaying this concern of the Party and the government with new glorious labor achievements in factories, in collective farm fields, in scientific laboratories, and in the many construction projects of our motherland.

    On the first day of the price reduction, Moscow's department stores were crowded with customers, all choosing their favorite clothes and food.

    在一个工人的家庭里
    苏联巴·库兹聂佐夫
    一
    已经是晚上了，当“镰刀与锤子”工厂的压延车间里的收音机播送出苏联部长会议与苏共中央关于新的减低物价的决定时，人们就情不自禁地想聚集在一起，倾心地谈着自己的愉快和自己生活上的计划。
    这天晚上，每个人都怀着一种豪迈的心情。这是一种对于自己亲爱的社会主义祖国感到自豪的心情，对于党和政府关于减价决定的非常满意的心情。
    工人列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫用简单而诚恳的话表达出了这种心情：
    “我们工人，全心全意地把自己所有的力量都献给了祖国，献给了共产党。而我们的党，亲爱的政府，则全心全意地关怀着人民。我们祖国永远不可摧毁的强大力量，就在于人民、党和政府的紧密团结！”
    在车间会议上，人们表达出了许多内心的思想。生活发生了美好的变化，它一天天变得更加优越，美丽和丰富了。
    列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫在工厂里干了四十年活。就在这一个车间里，他接替了自己父亲的工作。列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫的儿子也在工厂里工作，他是莫斯科普通冶金工人家庭里的第三代的代表。
    我们的人民经受过许多考验，在剧烈破坏资本主义遗留给我们的一切旧东西的年代里，我们也曾经历过不少的困难与艰辛。但是共产党和苏维埃政权带来了新生，就像晶滢的透明的河水流入了炎热的沙漠一样，以它那无往不胜的强大力量把生活推向前进。
    我们的城市和乡村曾在法西斯侵略者所挑起的残酷的战火中燃烧，而且其中许多已变成了灰烬，苏联人民曾英勇地保卫了亲爱祖国的荣誉、自由和独立，经受了多少的牺牲和损失！这是很久以前的事情吗？不久，时间还过了不久啊，而我们却已怎样地前进了，建设起来了，更加坚强有力了。生活一年年地更好了，而我们所追求的目标——共产主义是更加接近了。我们的幸福就在这里。”
    在晚间的集会上，压延工人们热烈地、亲切地谈到了不断关怀着人民福利的共产党和苏维埃政府。夜班工人们怀着巨大的热情负起了超计划生产数十吨辗铁的任务。二
    在列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫的家庭里，是不很喜欢回忆起过去的日子的。老费道尔·伏罗比耶夫在罗果什地方的工厂主古若恩家中做了四十年工，在临死时还向儿子们发牢骚说：
    “这种日子简直是活见鬼！我好像是活了一辈子，可是又好像是没有活过一样。无论干了多少活，还落得个周身是债。”
    费道尔的儿子列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫在资本主义制度下，也遭受过生活的压迫。祖传的冶金工人们在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利前，尽了一切力量，然而无论如何还是不能摆脱贫穷和债务。
    那时，在工厂里，古若恩为工人们开了个露天铺子。这个资本主义的商店是这样做买卖的：尽管人们怎样节省，工资也是不够用。资本家古若恩残酷地压榨工人，铺子中货物的价钱非常贵，但是又实在没有其他办法，因为工厂里的投机商人不让其他竞争者到工厂附近来。人们一天从早六点到晚六点挺着腰板干，哪里还有时间去想东西较便宜些的远处的市场呢，只好买手边的东西！
    今天，伏罗比耶夫全家痛苦地回忆起了这一切。他们回忆起这些，不仅是因为体会到在我们苏维埃生活中的光辉的变化的快乐，合情地、亲身感受地来想想这些成就的伟大。他们回忆起这些，还因为在我国以外还存在着许多古若恩，他们鼓吹战争，榨取工人家庭里最后的精力，并使数以百万计的劳动者遭受失业、贫穷和饥饿。三
    压延工人列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫家庭的财政状况，和成千上万的工人家庭并没有什么区别。伏罗比耶夫家中每天有肉、鱼、油、牛奶、蔬菜、白面包、糖、面制食品、茶和其他食品。五次减低物价，年复一年地改善了这个家庭的物质福利。
    列奥尼得·费道罗维奇订有画报、报纸，购置着古典作家的作品。时常和全家去看戏或看电影。
    一九五二年，列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫家的工资收入共达三万二千卢布以上。
    伏罗比耶夫的大儿子单独生活，他曾受过专门教育，现在是一个电气技师，女儿已在十年制学校里毕了业，孙儿由国家供给，正在小学校里读书。这位老工人和他工厂中的许多同志一样，每年在休假期间到国内最好的疗养院去。在资本主义制度下所不能达到的这一切，都已成为苏联工人寻常的事情了。新的减低物价，给这位莫斯科压延工人的家庭财政带来了显著的好处。在按照新价钱售货的第一天，忙碌而勤劳的主妇阿尼西亚·卡比托诺夫娜用规定家庭一天的用款所买到的东西，比过去任何时候都多。
    家里人看见她提着个新的皮制提包，满满地装着蔬菜、苹果和橘子。这一天还买了头等鱼肉、酱汁，一公斤肥牛肉，一包黄油和一包糖。
    “我决定买了这个大一点和结实一点的提包，因为旧的有点小了，有点不够用了！”女主人打趣地说，“还有，这个提包按新价钱，省出了一公斤半的糖钱呢。”
    根据压延工人伏罗比耶夫的简单的计算，他的家庭，即包括他的妻子、女儿和孙儿，在新的减低物价之后，每月大约可节省五百卢布。
    这个工人家庭中所节省出来的这几百个新的卢布，是每一天在生活必需品中不易觉察地聚集起来的。因为一切东西都便宜了：无论是日常食品和工业品。
    “集少成多，这次新的减低物价，使我家每年几乎可以得益六千卢布。用这些钱可以买一架无线电传真器，一个电气冰箱，一套男装，两件丝质衣料，三双最新式的皮鞋，一辆小孩自行车和两件大衣！”老工人计算着说。
    在压延工人列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫家的畅谈中，显示出了党和政府所通过的决议的最伟大意义，苏联的普通人们是深刻了解这一点的，他们在这个决定中感到亲爱的共产党和苏联政府对人民的迫切需要，对满足全社会经常增长着的物质文化需要的慈父般的关怀。感到这种关怀的不只是工人列奥尼得·伏罗比耶夫一家，而是我们光明而辽阔的祖国的成千成万个工人、农民和职员的家庭。数以百万计的苏联人民，在工厂中，在集体农庄田野上，在科学实验室，在我们祖国许许多多的建筑工程中，以新的光荣劳动功绩，来报答党和政府的这种关怀。（原载四月二日“真理报”）（附图片）
    在减价的第一天，莫斯科各百货商店里挤满了顾客，他们都在选购自己最心爱的衣物食品
