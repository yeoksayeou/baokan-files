Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 17th: The Romanian newspaper "Spark" published an editorial on April 14th, welcoming the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. The editorial considered this agreement as the first victory leading to the immediate resumption of armistice negotiations, the final resolution of the POW issue, and the conclusion of an armistice agreement. The editorial pointed out that the peace forces, led by the Soviet Union, have been fighting for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue from the very beginning. The current proposal from the Korean and Chinese side has created the conditions for removing the final obstacles on the path to armistice and thus ending the Korean War.

The editorial stated that the Romanian people support all actions aimed at peacefully resolving the Korean issue and re-establishing peace. It is entirely proper that the people of all countries in the world sponsor and warmly support every action and every step towards ending the Korean War, as it is in the interest of those whose sons are shedding blood on the Korean battlefield, and in the interest of the people of the whole world who are increasingly determined to defend peace and the future of mankind. Those who are determined to hinder the end of the Korean War can only expose their faces as enemies of peace in the face of public opinion, and they are bound to fail.

The editorial concluded by saying that the people of all countries in the world now hope that the U.S. side will also show its desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue with actions, and hope that the U.S. side will agree to immediately resume armistice negotiations in Panmunjom, conclude an armistice agreement, and establish peace in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 17th: The American people welcome the Korean-Chinese peace proposal and are eager to stop the bloodshed in Korea. They are indignant that the bourgeois press is attempting to portray this new hope for peace as a "worrying" matter. On April 10th, the New York "Daily Worker" reprinted two representative letters to the editor from other American newspapers, illustrating this sentiment of the American people. A letter from Macklin, published in the Louisville, Kentucky "Courier-Journal," criticized the "peace panic" headlines in the national newspapers' economic sections. Macklin said: "To interpret this headline in plain language, it means: 'We are afraid that our young men will no longer have to die in Korea, because if the war stops, business will not be so good, and some of us may lose our jobs...' How outrageous is this statement?"

Macklin refuted the absurdity of this statement, pointing out that peace is truly in the interest of the American people. He said: "The tens of billions of dollars wasted can be used for constructive things, which can enable us to live in a better country and world."

The letter concluded by urging the saving of American soldiers' lives to comfort the eager hopes of their families.

Another letter was written by Cowan Smith, a veteran from Springfield, Massachusetts, to the "Springfield Daily News."

Smith wrote that peace in Korea is now closer than ever before, "At such a time, expectations and a certain degree of optimism should arise... However, the actual situation seems to be quite the opposite." He blamed the newspapers for issuing pessimistic tones, Wall Street for fearing economic depression, and the highest-ranking American officials for expressing doubt.

He then described the American people's lack of interest in this unpopular Korean War and said: "Now is a time to be gratified because the war may be coming to an end soon. No matter what the situation is after the armistice, it is better than constantly dying on the battlefield."

    罗“火花报”发表社论欢迎遣返病伤战俘协定指出朝中建议为结束朝鲜战争创造条件
    美国人民渴望停止流血反对资产阶级的“和平恐慌”
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】罗马尼亚“火花报”四月十四日发表社论，欢迎遣返病伤被俘人员协定，认为这项协定是导致立即恢复停战谈判、最后解决战俘问题并缔结停战协定的第一个胜利。社论指出，以苏联为首的和平力量，一开始就为和平解决朝鲜问题而斗争。目前的朝中方面的建议，已为清除停战道路上的最后障碍从而结束朝鲜战争创造了条件。
    社论说，罗马尼亚人民支持了旨在和平解决朝鲜问题并重新建立和平的一切行动。全世界各国人民，对于旨在结束朝鲜战争的每一个行动和走向这个目标的每一步进展，都予以赞助和热烈的支持，这是完全正当的，因为这既符合于那些有子弟在朝鲜战场上流血的人们的利益，又符合于日益坚决地保卫和平与人类前途的全世界人民的利益。那些一心要阻碍结束朝鲜战争的人们，只能在舆论面前暴露出和平之敌的面目，并且他们是一定要失败的。
    社论最后说，全世界各国人民现在希望美方也用行动来表明它的和平解决朝鲜问题的愿望，希望美方同意立即在板门店恢复停战谈判，缔结停战协定，并在朝鲜建立和平。
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】美国人民欢迎朝中和平建议，渴望停止在朝鲜的流血。他们对于资产阶级报纸企图把这种新的和平希望形容成一种“令人忧虑”的事情表示愤怒。四月十日纽约“工人日报”转载别家美国报纸发表的两封具有代表性的读者来信，说明了美国人民的这种情绪。肯塔基州路易斯维尔地方的“信使日报”发表的麦·克林的信指责全国各报经济栏的“和平恐慌”的标题。克林说：“把这种标题用普通的话来解释，就是说：‘我们唯恐我们的年青人不必再在朝鲜送命，因为假使战争停止的话，生意便没有那么好了，同时我们中有些人可能会失业……’这种说法多么令人气愤？”
    克林驳斥这种说法的荒谬，指出和平才真是符合美国人民的利益的，他说：“浪费掉的数十百亿的美元可以用在建设性的事情上，这就可以使我们生活在一个较好的国家和世界里面。”
    这封信在结尾时敦促拯救美国士兵的生命，以慰他们家里人的切望。
    另一封信是马萨诸塞州斯普林腓特的一个退伍军人考门·史密斯写给“斯普林腓特每日新闻”的。
    史密斯写道，现在朝鲜和平是比以前任何时候都更为接近了，“在这样一个时候，本应产生期望与一定程度的乐观情绪……然而，实际的情况却似乎恰恰相反。”他责怪报纸发出悲观论调、华尔街害怕经济萧条和美国最高级官员表示怀疑。
    他接着描述了美国人民对这个不得人心的朝鲜战争不感兴趣的情况，并说：“现在正是值得欣慰的时机，因为战争可能快要结束了。不管停战后的情况如何，总比战场上不停地死人好些。”
