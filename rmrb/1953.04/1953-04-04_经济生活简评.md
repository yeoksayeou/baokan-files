　　Prevent Wheat Midge Early

　　The wheat midge is the most ferocious enemy of wheat. This pest emerges from the soil around the time wheat heads and flowers, lays eggs and transforms into larvae, sucking the sap from the wheat florets or developing grains, preventing the wheat from producing kernels or causing it to become empty husks. In areas severely affected by this pest, wheat crops may be completely lost.

　　Over the past three years, this pest has spread across more than 130 counties in eleven provinces, including Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, and Sichuan. Last year, the wheat midge in Henan had spread to Xinxiang and other areas north of the Yellow River, and the trend of northward expansion continues. In 1950, Nanyang Prefecture in Henan and Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui were affected by this pest, with estimated wheat yield reductions of over 400 million jin in both areas, accounting for more than 50 percent of the expected yield of the affected wheat area.

　　Last year, a large number of wheat midge overwintering larvae entered the soil, and the adult insects are about to emerge. Therefore, all areas that may be attacked by the wheat midge should start prevention and control work as early as possible. Party and government organs in these areas, especially agricultural departments and pest and disease prevention and control agencies, should repeatedly explain to the masses the severity of the harm this pest causes to wheat, teach the masses prevention and control methods, help the masses solve various specific difficulties, and resolutely eliminate it completely.

    及早防治小麦吸浆虫
    小麦吸浆虫是小麦的最为凶恶的敌人。这种害虫在小麦抽穗和开花前后出土，产卵化虫，吸吮小麦花房或灌浆麦粒的液汁，使小麦不能结实，或者成为空壳。在这种虫害为害严重的地区，小麦可能棵粒不收。
    三年来，这种虫害遍及陕西、新疆、江苏、安徽、河南、湖北、四川等十一省一百三十多县。去年河南的小麦吸浆虫已蔓延到黄河以北的新乡等地，且有继续向北发展的趋势。一九五○年，河南南阳和安徽阜阳两个专区，曾经遭受这种虫害，估计两地小麦减产四亿多斤，占受灾面积小麦应产量的百分之五十以上。
    去年小麦吸浆虫过冬幼虫入土者甚多，目前成虫即将出土。因此，凡有遭受小麦吸浆虫袭击可能的地区，应及早做好防治工作。这些地区的党政机关，特别是农业部门和病虫害防治机关，应该向群众反复说明这种虫害对小麦为害的严重性，向群众传授防治的办法，帮助群众解决各种具体困难，坚决把它消灭净尽。
