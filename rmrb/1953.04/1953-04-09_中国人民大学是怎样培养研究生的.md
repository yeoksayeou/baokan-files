Renmin University of China began cultivating graduate students in January 1950, successively establishing teaching and research offices for Finance and Economics, Russian Language, Marxism-Leninism, Chinese Revolution Problems, Law, Diplomacy, and Education, making preliminary efforts to train graduate students. In September of the same year, the university was officially established, and a large number of Soviet experts arrived. From then on, under the leadership of the president and with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, the university established 38 teaching and research offices (six of which had no graduate students) based on the original teaching and research offices, and formulated graduate education plans, officially commencing graduate student training.

In the past two years, the university has enrolled 1,969 graduate students, of whom 441 have been trained as teachers. More than 200 people were transferred elsewhere because they were not suitable for graduate studies. Currently, 1,216 graduate students are studying.

The training of graduate students has not only initially solved the difficulty of a lack of teachers within the university but has also provided a number of teaching staff for other schools.

The training of graduate students is conducted under the unified leadership of the President and the Research Department. The teaching and research offices, under the guidance of Soviet experts, specifically lead this work based on the principle of "linking theory with practice, and combining Soviet experience with Chinese conditions." The trainees can be basically divided into three categories: One category is working cadres. The vast majority are new cadres with three or four years of work history, and a small number are old cadres from the Anti-Japanese War period (accounting for only about 5%). Their political quality is relatively good, and their ideological level is also relatively high. They are eager to learn and willing to work hard. However, their cultural level is generally low. Another category is young intellectuals. Their educational level is relatively high, they are active in learning, and willing to accept the truth. However, their political and ideological level is generally low. In addition, there are a few lecturers and teaching assistants from old universities. Although their educational level is relatively high and they have some professional knowledge, their political and ideological level is very low, and their bourgeois ideology is also very strong. Although these three types of trainees have some differences in conditions, on the whole, they all lack systematic Marxist-Leninist theoretical knowledge, professional knowledge is even more lacking, and their self-study ability is also relatively low. Some of them have only undergone preliminary ideological transformation, and a few have not been transformed at all. This situation requires us to have specific steps, specific educational content, and methods suitable for this situation in the work of training graduate students.

Based on the actual situation, in terms of training steps and educational content, the university education plan stipulates that after enrolling, graduate students first undergo one to one and a half years of systematic study of basic Marxist-Leninist theory to improve their political and theoretical level. Then, they spend one to one and a half years studying scientific professional courses (one to three courses, divided into major and elective); two- or three-year graduate students also study Russian from the beginning. Time allocation: political theory accounts for about 28% of the total study time, Russian accounts for about 22%, and professional studies account for about 50%. After studying the above courses, graduate students can acquire systematic knowledge in political theory or professional skills. To further strengthen the connection between theory and practice and expand learning results, graduate students must regularly conduct production internships before graduation (internship locations are selected advanced enterprises, mines, farms, cooperatives, or government agencies). The internship duration is four to six weeks. During the production internship, graduate students must use the theory they have learned and write a complete production internship report based on the actual production situation.

To enable graduate students to have correct ideological awareness, cultivate a spirit of collectivism and a hardworking and simple work style of serving the people, it is necessary to conduct political and ideological education constantly. In the past two years, in addition to conducting political and theoretical education for graduate students, the university has also conducted ideological and political education for them through various political movements, current affairs policy studies, combined with criticism and self-criticism.

In terms of training methods, based on the specific conditions of graduate students, the university regards the combination of systematic teaching and self-study as the basic method for training graduate students at present. At the beginning of each lesson, Soviet experts (or Chinese teachers) first conduct systematic and focused lectures. After class, graduate students conduct self-study based on the content of the lectures: reading the assigned reference books and taking notes. Teachers provide regular tutoring. At the end of a course, a classroom discussion is held. This method not only deepens and consolidates the learning of graduate students but also ensures the gradual improvement of their self-study ability. In addition, regular examinations, tests, and appraisals are adopted as important methods for training graduate students.

Regular examinations and tests are conducted according to the education plan. They can not only supervise and check the daily study of graduate students, but also consolidate the knowledge learned by graduate students through organized and planned review during the examination period. Regular appraisal includes academic year appraisal and graduation appraisal. Its purpose is to summarize the learning and ideological progress of graduate students in a certain period. Through appraisal, the leadership can not only gain a comprehensive understanding of graduate students, which is the basis for conducting specific education for graduate students, deciding whether they can graduate, and determining their academic positions, but also improve their ideological level and strengthen their learning confidence. In the later stage of professional course study, graduate students, under the guidance of Soviet experts, write papers in a planned way, combined with their majors. This method can not only exercise graduate students' ability to study and delve into problems on their own but also lay the foundation for their future scientific research work. Finally, there is teaching practice. Before graduation, graduate students serve as interns or lecturers for two to three times to exercise their teaching ability.

In the process of training graduate students, what experiences has the university leadership gained?

First, the leadership clearly recognized the importance of graduate student training, which must be listed as one of the main contents of university construction, and planned organization of this work is the key to doing this work well. Because, first, the development of higher education in New China is very rapid, but the teaching staff left over from the old education, whether in terms of quantity or quality, is far from meeting the requirements of the new development situation. Second, higher education in New China takes Marxism-Leninism as its guide; the talents required for the construction of New China must understand advanced scientific theory and advanced technology. In this regard, our country currently has little or no ready-made teachers. Therefore, we must attach great importance to the training of new reserve forces—graduate students.

Second, regarding the quality and study period of graduate students. According to the current conditions, it is impossible to demand too much in terms of quality for graduate students. We must look at whether they possess the basic conditions that can be cultivated from the perspective of future development. However, the conditions cannot be too low, and we cannot recruit too many; otherwise, not only will the purpose of training teachers not be achieved, but it will also form a great waste of human and financial resources. We have profound lessons in this regard. In the past two years, we have enrolled a total of 1,969 graduate students, and 298 were transferred midway due to insufficient conditions, which cannot but be said to be a great waste. Therefore, the education department must first consider their various conditions when allocating graduates to do graduate studies. As for the study period of graduate students, based on the experience of the past two years and the current conditions of graduate students, three years is still appropriate. Because only in this way can the theoretical level of graduate students be systematically improved, allowing them to have sufficient time to study professional knowledge and conduct planned production internships; at the same time, it can also better improve graduate students' self-study and independent research ability, laying the foundation for their future continuous development.

Finally, in the work of training graduate students, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union:

First, the purpose of training graduate students must be clear. That is to say, in terms of political theory, specialized science, and ideological awareness, we should stipulate certain goals, requiring graduate students to be able to independently undertake the teaching of specialized science after graduation and be able to serve the people wholeheartedly. Therefore, the educational content for graduate students should first emphasize Marxist-Leninist education and stipulate it as a basic course in the teaching plan. Only after graduate students have mastered this science can they delve into other specialized sciences and become advanced professional teachers and scientific workers. Even for short-term one-year graduate students, there should be such requirements. Second, special attention should be paid to the integrity of the professional science system, emphasizing the systematic study and in-depth research of various professional sciences; at the same time, pay attention to learning sciences related to professional science. Only in this way can we ensure a certain level of graduate students in specialized science and create conditions for further improvement in the future, making the horizons of graduate students broader. Again, attention must be paid to improving graduate students' self-study and independent scientific research ability during the training process. Therefore, in terms of training methods, it is not appropriate to adopt the lecture method too much, but to cultivate their self-study and independent research ability, and cultivate their habits of independent thinking and independent labor.

Second, we must pay attention to science and planning. This has been reflected in the teaching plan, teaching content, teaching methods, and the entire teaching process and teaching organization. All 32 teaching and research offices in the school have their professional graduate teaching plans, which strictly stipulate the time for each course (lectures, discussions), production internships, scientific papers, teaching internships, and examinations and tests. In addition, each course has a lecture plan, classroom discussion topics, and a list of reference books. Only in this way can we train graduate students well. Therefore, when formulating these plans, we should fully consider various conditions, and once determined, we must ensure accurate implementation; if the task cannot be completed according to the plan, it is a violation of discipline.

Third, according to Soviet experience, the strict training of graduate students is not manifested in simple administrative management, but in strong leadership, strict plans, the cultivation of learning habits, and the observance of labor discipline. In this regard, Soviet experts not only gave the school strong guidance in principles and methods but also set an example with their own actions. They obey the leadership of the school, strictly implement the work plan, emphasize labor efficiency, and abide by labor discipline.

Fourth, according to Soviet experience, the specific work of training graduate students at Renmin University of China is undertaken by various teaching and research offices. Each teaching and research office regards the work of training graduate students and teaching work as equally important tasks. This has the following advantages: graduate students can directly accept the leadership of the director of the teaching and research office and the relevant teachers. In this way, the education and teaching work of graduate students can be better combined. The teaching and research office also treats graduate students as future teachers, caring for them in all aspects and improving their learning efficiency. The Soviet experts in each teaching and research office work as scientific instructors. In addition to compiling teaching materials, they focus on the training of teachers. Therefore, the graduate students in each teaching and research office also receive direct guidance and education from Soviet experts.

Because Renmin University of China urgently needs to train a large number of teachers at present, and the level of graduate students enrolled is relatively low, and their self-study ability is still poor, in training graduate students, we have adopted a transitional method that combines the Soviet method of training graduate students and the teaching methods for students. In the formulation of the teaching plan, it is not formulated for each individual but for a group of the same major. In terms of training methods, we do not simply adopt the method of self-study and independent research, but adopt a method that combines classroom lectures and self-study. Since the summer vacation of last year, the school has compiled first-year graduate students into graduate classes to carry out the theoretical education of Marxism-Leninism; from the second year, they are allowed to go to the professional teaching and research offices to carry out professional studies. In this way, it provides preparatory education for graduate students for each teaching and research office, saving the strength of each teaching and research office.

The above is the main experience of Renmin University of China in training graduate students. In the past two years, the school has used the above methods to train and is training a large number of graduate students. However, due to the changes in the political and theoretical level and cultural level of graduate students, the content and methods of training graduate students will also be improved accordingly in the future. Starting this year, the school decided to select a group of graduate students from undergraduate graduates; they have all systematically studied Marxist-Leninist theory and have certain professional knowledge. We will train them using the formal Soviet method of training graduate students: under the guidance of Soviet experts and designated teachers, we will formulate a research plan for each person (in terms of learning content, the weight of political theory will be greatly reduced, and the research of specialized science will be emphasized). In terms of learning methods, we generally no longer adopt the method of attending classes, but mainly focus on independent research. It is expected that graduate students trained in this way will gradually reach the general level of Soviet graduate students. This will play a greater role in improving teaching quality.

    中国人民大学是怎样培养研究生的
    中国人民大学研究生科
    中国人民大学从一九五○年一月起，先后成立了财政经济、俄文、马克思列宁主义、中国革命问题、法律、外交、教育等教研室，初步着手培养研究生。同年九月间，学校正式成立，大批苏联专家到校，从此以后，就在校长领导和苏联专家的直接帮助下，在原有教研室的基础上分别成立了三十八个教研室（内有六个教研室无研究生），并制定了研究生的教育计划，正式开始了培养研究生的工作。
    两年多以来，学校曾招收了研究生一千九百六十九名，其中四百四十一名已培养成为教员。有二百多人因不适于做研究生，已调他处。目前，一千二百十六名研究生正在学习中。
    研究生的培养，不仅初步解决了校内师资缺乏的困难，同时给其他学校供给了一批教学骨干。
    培养研究生的工作，是在校长和研究部的统一领导下进行的。教研室则在苏联专家的指导下，根据“理论与实际相联系，苏联经验与中国情况相结合”的方针，具体地领导这一工作。培养的对象，基本上可分为三类：一类是工作干部。其中绝大多数是有三、四年工作历史的新干部，少数是抗日战争时期的老干部（仅占百分之五左右）。他们的政治质量是比较好的，思想水平也比较高，他们渴望学习，肯于埋头苦干；但文化水平一般是比较低的。另一类是青年知识分子。他们的文化程度比较高，学习积极，肯于接受真理；但政治思想水平一般较低。此外尚有少数旧大学的讲师、助教。他们的文化程度虽然较高，而且具有一些业务知识，但政治思想水平很低，资产阶级思想也比较浓厚。这三类对象，在条件上虽有若干差别，但总的看来，他们均缺乏系统的马克思列宁主义理论知识，专业知识更是缺乏，自修能力也比较低。其中有一部分人仅经过初步的思想改造，少数还是根本未经改造的。这种情况，要求我们在培养研究生的工作上，必须有适合于这种情况的具体的步骤以及具体的教育内容和方法。
    根据实际情况，在培养的步骤和教育内容上，学校教育计划规定：研究生入学后，首先进行一年至一年半的系统的马克思列宁主义基本理论的学习，以提高政治理论水平。然后以一年至一年半的时间，学习科学专业课程（一门到三门，分主修和选修两种）；二、三年制研究生并从开始即学习俄文。时间分配：政治理论约占总学习时数的百分之二十八，俄文占百分之二十二左右，专业约占百分之五十。研究生在学习上述几种课程以后，就可以在政治理论上或业务上获得系统的知识。为进一步加强理论和实际的联系，扩大学习效果，研究生在毕业前必须定期进行生产实习（实习场所是选定的先进的企业、矿山、农场、合作社或机关）。实习时间为四周到六周。研究生在生产实习过程中，必须运用所学到的理论，结合生产实际写出完整的生产实习报告。
    为了使研究生具有正确的思想意识，养成集体主义的精神和艰苦朴实的为人民服务的工作作风，必须经常不断地进行政治思想教育。两年多来，学校除对研究生进行政治理论教育外，并通过各种政治运动、时事政策学习，结合批评和自我批评，对他们进行了思想政治教育。
    在培养的方法上，根据研究生的具体条件，学校把系统讲授和自修相结合的方法作为当前培养研究生的基本方法。每课开始时，先由苏联专家（或中国教员）系统地、有重点地进行讲授。课后，研究生根据讲授内容进行自修：阅读指定的参考书，做读书笔记。教员则定期进行辅导。课程告一段落时，即进行一次课堂讨论。这种方法不仅使研究生的学习得以深入和巩固，而且也保证了研究生自修能力的逐步提高。此外，还采用了定期考试、测验和鉴定的办法，作为培养研究生的重要方法。
    定期考试、测验是按教育计划进行的。它既可以督促检查研究生的平时学习，同时更可通过考试期间有组织有计划的复习，使研究生学得的知识巩固起来。定期鉴定分学年鉴定、毕业鉴定两种。它的目的在于总结研究生在一定时期内的学习、思想进步情况。通过鉴定，领导方面不仅可对研究生获得全面的了解，——这是对研究生进行具体教育、决定其毕业与否、确定其学职的依据，还可以提高研究生的思想水平，加强其学习信心。到专业课的学习后期，研究生在苏联专家指导下，结合所学专业，有计划地写作论文。这种方法不仅可以锻炼研究生自修钻研问题的能力，还可以为他们今后的科学研究工作打下基础。最后是教学实习。研究生在毕业前担任二——三次实习或主讲课，以锻炼他们的教学能力。
    在培养研究生的过程中，学校领导方面取得了那些经验呢？
    首先，领导方面明确认识了培养研究生工作的重要性——必须把这一工作列为学校建设的主要内容之一，而有计划地组织这一工作，乃是做好这一工作的关键。因为，第一、新中国高等教育的发展是很快的，但是旧教育所遗留给我们的教学人员，无论在数量或质量方面都远不能满足新的发展形势的要求。第二、新中国的高等教育是以马克思列宁主义为指南的；新中国建设所要求的人材必须懂得先进科学理论和先进的技术。而在这方面我国目前还没有或者很少有现成的师资。因此，必须十分重视新的后备力量——研究生的培养。
    其次，关于研究生的质量和学习期限问题。根据目前的条件，在质量方面对研究生不可能要求过高，必须从发展前途上看他们是否具备可以培养的基本条件。但在条件上亦不能要求过低，招收过滥；否则不但达不到培养师资的目的，反而形成人力财力上的很大浪费。我们在这方面有着深刻的教训。二年多来我们共招收研究生一千九百六十九名，因条件不够而中途调动的就有二百九十八名，这不能不说是很大的浪费。因此，教育部门在分配毕业生做研究生时，必须首先考虑到他们的各种条件。至于研究生的学习期限问题，根据过去两年多以来的经验以及目前研究生的条件，仍以三年为宜。因为只有这样才能系统地提高研究生的理论水平，让他有充分的时间学习业务知识，并进行有计划的生产实习；同时也可更好地提高研究生的自修和独立研究的能力，为其今后的不断发展打下基础。
    最后，在培养研究生的工作上，必须学习苏联的先进经验：
    第一、培养研究生的目的要明确。就是说，在政治理论、专门科学、思想意识等各方面，都应该规定一定的目标，要求研究生在毕业以后能够独立担任专门科学的教学，并能够全心全意为人民服务。因此，对研究生的教育内容，首先应重视马克思列宁主义教育并在教学计划中把它规定为基础的课程。研究生只有在掌握了这门科学之后，才可能深入钻研其它的专门科学，成为先进的专业师资和科学工作者。即使对短期的一年制的研究生，也应该有这样的要求。其次，要特别注意专业科学体系的完整性，强调各专业科学的系统学习和深入钻研；同时，注意学习和专业科学有关的科学。只有这样，才能保证研究生在专门科学上的一定水平，并为将来进一步提高创造条件，使研究生的眼界更为开阔。再次，在培养过程中必须注意提高研究生的自修和独立从事科学研究的能力。因此，在培养的方法上，不宜过多地采用讲授的方式，而要培养其自修和独立研究的能力，培养其独立思考和独立劳动的习惯。
    第二、必须注意科学性和计划性。这一点已经在教学计划、教学内容、教学方法以及整个教学过程、教学组织等各方面体现出来了。全校三十二个教研室都有其专业的研究生教学计划，它严格地规定了各课程（讲授、讨论）、生产实习、科学论文、教学实习以及考试测验的时间。此外，每门课程均有讲授计划、课堂讨论题目、参考书目录。只有这样，才能很好地培养研究生。因此，在制定这些计划时，应充分考虑到多种条件，而一经确定，就必须保证准确地执行；如果不能按计划完成任务，便是违犯纪律的行为。
    第三、根据苏联的经验，对研究生的严格训练并不表现在单纯的行政管理上，而是表现在坚强的领导、严密的计划、学习习惯的养成和劳动纪律的遵守上。在这一方面，苏联专家不仅在原则和方法上给了学校以有力的指导，同时用他们自己的行动来作了示范。他们服从学校的领导，严格执行工作计划，强调劳动效率和遵守劳动纪律。
    第四、根据苏联经验，中国人民大学培养研究生的具体工作，由各个教研室来担负。各教研室把培养研究生的工作和教学工作作为同等重要的任务。这有如下的好处：研究生可直接接受教研室主任和各有关教师的领导。这样，对研究生的教育和教学工作就能更好地结合起来。而教研室也把研究生当作未来的教师，从各方面关心他们，提高他们的学习效率。各教研室的苏联专家是以科学指导员的资格进行工作的，他们除编写教材外，把主要精力放在师资的培养上，因此各教研室的研究生也受到苏联专家的直接指导和教育。
    中国人民大学由于目前急需大量培养师资，且所招收的研究生的水平相当低，自修能力也还差，所以在培养研究生方面，就采用了把苏联培养研究生的方法和对学生的教学方法加以综合了的过渡办法。在教学计划的制定上，就不是按每个人而是按同样专业的一个组来制定的。在培养方法上，就不单纯采取自修和独立研究的办法，而是采取课堂讲授和自修相结合的办法。从去年暑期起，学校曾将一年级研究生编为研究生班，进行马克思列宁主义的理论教育；从二年级开始才让他们到各专业教研室进行专业的学习。这样就代各教研室给研究生进行了准备教育，节省了各教研室的力量。
    以上就是中国人民大学培养研究生的主要经验。两年多以来，学校曾运用上述办法，培养了并培养着大批研究生。但由于研究生政治理论水平和文化水平的变化，今后培养研究生的内容和办法也将随着改进。从今年起，学校决定从本科毕业生中选拔一批研究生；他们都已系统地学习了马克思列宁主义理论，且有一定的专业知识。对他们我们将用苏联培养研究生的正规办法加以培养：在苏联专家和指定教师的指导下，制定每个人的研究计划（在学习内容上，政治理论的分量将大为减少，而着重专门科学的研究）。在学习方法上一般地不再采取上课的方式，而以独立研究为主。预计这样培养出来的研究生，将逐步达到苏联研究生的一般水平。这对于教学质量的提高会起较大的作用。
