According to a letter from reader Hu Bingyuan of Gaiping County: The peasant masses of Gaiping County, Liaodong Province, are very dissatisfied with the fact that cadres at all levels of the government are forcing them to grow cotton. The peasants of Gaiping County generally do not want to grow cotton, mainly because: the area planted with cotton is too large, making it impossible to "rotate crops," cotton pests are serious year after year, some cotton farmers are unable to invest in buying medicines and equipment, and the technical training work is not done well, resulting in poor cotton harvests every year; last year, the grain supply was insufficient, and during the period between the exhaustion of the old crop and the harvesting of the new, most farmers had no grain to eat, and state-owned stores and cooperatives also had no grain to sell, which made cotton farmers very miserable; coupled with the fact that flower and yarn companies and cooperatives lowered the grades when purchasing cotton and the relative increase in agricultural taxes on cotton fields, the farmers of Gaiping felt that growing cotton was not as good as growing grain. The masses in various villages have been reporting to the cadres who are inspecting spring plowing: No matter how the government mobilizes us, we must grow enough grain for our families before we can grow cotton. Now, the cadres in various villages are worried about "failing to complete the task of planting cotton area assigned by the higher authorities for 1953." Some villages have held five or six meetings, repeatedly "mobilizing" and saying, "Not growing cotton is unpatriotic." Some farmers were forced to agree to plant a little bit. Therefore, when cadres called for the selection of cotton seeds, the masses were unwilling to select them; some district and village cadres checked households one by one, and as a result, some farmers put a layer of selected cotton seeds on top of a sack of cotton seeds to cope with the inspection. Some women put a small ladle of cotton seeds on the kang (heated platform), and when they saw cadres coming to inspect from the window, they picked up and selected them a few times, and when the cadres left, they picked up the needlework they had at hand and continued to do it.

Gaiping County has a total of 900,000 mu of land, and 300,000 mu were planted with cotton in 1952; according to a report in "Liaodong Dazhong," this accounts for one-third of the cotton planting area in Liaodong Province. Several districts have never grown cotton before, but tens of thousands of mu have been forced to be planted since 1951, many of which are planted on mountainous and sandy land that is not suitable for growing cotton at all. Agricultural leadership organs advocate "crop rotation," but all the land suitable for cotton planting in Gaiping County has been planted with cotton for years, making "crop rotation" impossible. For example, the cotton field assignment in Tuotaibao Village is based on an average allocation of 60 percent of the arable land; if the mountainous land, low-lying land, vegetable gardens, and orchards are removed from Tuotaibao Village, and then 60 percent of the arable land is removed for cotton fields, there is not much arable land left, so where can they "rotate crops"? This year, Gaiping County has determined that the cotton planting area will be 280,000 mu, which is a little less than last year; however, it still accounts for nearly one-third of the total cultivated land area; because there is still a lot of land that is not suitable for growing cotton, it is still impossible to "rotate crops" and avoid planting cotton on land that is not suitable for it. Judging from the mood of the peasants, it is impossible to complete the plan of 280,000 mu. The leadership of Liaodong Province and Gaiping County should consider this issue realistically and revise this plan. Otherwise, it will either make the plan a mere formality or encourage the district and village cadres to issue mandatory orders, which will not be of any benefit to increasing production.

### 辽东盖平县应修正植棉计划

    辽东盖平县应修正植棉计划
    据盖平县读者胡秉元来信：辽东省盖平县农民群众对于各级政府干部强迫他们种植棉花非常不满。盖平县农民一般都不愿意种棉花，主要原因是：种棉面积太大，无法“倒茬”，连年棉花虫害严重，有些棉农无力投资买药械，而且技术传授工作做得也不好，棉花年年歉收；去年粮食供给不足，在青黄不接的时候，农民大部分没有粮食吃，国营商店和合作社也没有粮食卖，把棉农弄得很苦；加以花纱布公司、合作社收购棉花时压低等级和棉田农业税的相对增加，盖平农民就感到种棉花不如种粮食。各村群众纷纷向检查春耕的干部反映：政府无论怎样动员，我们也得种够全家吃的粮食以外才能种棉花。现在各村干部都在为“完不成上级布置的一九五三年植棉面积的任务”而发愁。有的村开了五六次会，反复“动员”，讲“不种棉花就是不爱国”，有些农民被逼问得没法，才勉强答应了种一点点。因此，干部号召挑选棉花种籽，群众也不肯选；有些区村干部就挨户检查，结果有些农民就把一麻袋棉籽上边装上一层选好了的棉籽来应付。有的妇女在炕上放一小瓢棉籽，从窗户里望见干部来检查的时候，就拿起来挑选两下，等干部走了，就又把身边放着的针线活计拿起来做。
    盖平县共有九十万亩地，一九五二年种棉三十万亩；据“辽东大众”报道，占全辽东省植棉面积的三分之一。有几个区历来就没有种过棉花，从一九五一年起已强迫种上了几万亩，有许多是种在根本不适于种棉花的山地和大砂石地上的。农业领导机关提倡“倒茬轮作”，可是，盖平全县可植棉花的土地连年都种上棉花了，要“倒茬”就不可能。如驼台堡村布置棉田是以耕地面积的百分之六十平均摊派的；驼台堡村去掉了山地、洼地、菜园、果园，再除了百分之六十的棉田，就没有多少耕地了，往那里去“倒茬”呢？盖平县今年确定植棉面积是二十八万亩，比去年减少了一些；可是，仍占全部耕地面积近三分之一；因为还有不少不适宜种棉花的土地，所以要“倒茬”，要避免把棉花种在不适于种棉花的土地上，还是不可能的。就农民的情绪来看，这二十八万亩的计划是不可能完成的了。辽东省和盖平县领导方面应当实事求是地考虑这个问题，修正这个计划。不然，不是使计划流于形式，就是促成区村干部的强迫命令，对于增产是不会有任何好处的。
