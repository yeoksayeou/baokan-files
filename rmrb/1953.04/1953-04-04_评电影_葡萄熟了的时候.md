    Even before the movie was filmed, the literary screenplay of "When the Grapes Are Ripe" had already received praise from some readers and favorable reviews in publications. After the film was released, newspapers and periodicals in various places continued to publish recommending film reviews. The reason why this work has received such welcome, I think, is mainly because it adapts to the demands of the people to a certain extent: depicting our new life today and the new atmosphere of the countryside. In addition to watching films depicting their past suffering and struggle, the people are eager to see the new society, the new atmosphere, and the happy new life of the people through artistic images. It is worthy of welcome and encouragement that the playwright puts his eyes and enthusiasm for praise on the theme of the people's vital interests and the new things that are leaping forward. The film raises a major issue in rural life—the market issue of agricultural products—and in the solution of this issue, it shows the protection of state-owned economy and cooperative economy for farmers, as well as the struggle against illegal merchants. The farmers in the film, especially the young men and women in the countryside, show vigorous vitality and joy in labor. The structure of the script, mainly the first half, has considerable drama. Because of all this, the audience's welcome to the film is justified.

    Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that this film still has shortcomings. Pointing out these shortcomings will be conducive to the further development of new films.

    The theme of this film is mainly to show whether the cooperative should purchase grapes produced by farmers. Behind this issue, there was originally a profound social conflict (the struggle between the Party, the People's Government, and cooperatives and illegal private merchants, and the struggle between Party organizations and Party leading organs that actively strive for the interests of the people and Party members, government workers, and cooperative workers who cannot actively strive for the interests of the people). However, this film did not seriously unfold this profound conflict, but limited it to a narrow, accidental, and easily solvable scope, which greatly reduced the theme. In such a story, the author could and should have focused on depicting the struggle between two types of cadres and two types of ideas to clarify this theme, namely: the Party's concern for the interests of the people, only the interests of the people are the interests of the Party, and the Party's resolute struggle against all phenomena that ignore the interests of the people. It should be said that the filmmakers did not fail to touch on this theme. The author did attempt to create the image of Ding Laogui, the director of the cooperative, to criticize the idea of neglecting the interests of the masses. However, this theme was not valued by the author, but only treated as an accompaniment to the issue of cooperative policy, and therefore was not deeply explored and unfolded, but lightly passed over. Although the script does feature a positive character who opposes Ding Laogui, the branch secretary who represents the Party's leadership, the appearance of this positive character is only to illustrate the author's views on cooperatives, and has not become an indispensable part of the plot, and is not written very successfully, so the correct ideas and work styles and Party policies that are opposed to incorrect ideas and work styles cannot be well expressed.

    Because the real conflict is not unfolded, the artificiality of the contradictions and the accidental nature of resolving the contradictions are manifested in the film.

    The entanglement depicted in the film takes place in an environment where a village seems to have little contact with the Party's leadership, the leadership of the cooperative's superiors, and various aspects of the city; farmers have been growing grapes for many years, and the whole village has been making a living from grapes for many years, but they do not know whether the grapes have a market, nor do they know that the winery in the city has already started work, and they never consider organizing transportation and sales. Only after Zhou Dama and the director of the cooperative had a big fight, and after the private merchants tried to lower the price to buy the grapes, did the branch secretary and others passively intervene in this matter, and only relied on the accidental arrival of workers who installed and repaired the waterwheel, he accidentally thought that the winery in the city might have already started work, and helped everyone find clues, and then solved the problem of the grapes' outlet. This environment is unrealistic, and the resolution of the contradiction is also accidental.

    Why do we say that the contradictions in this film are artificial? Because: the entanglement between Zhou Dama and Ding Laogui occupies an important position in the work, but according to the development of the story, the quarrel between Zhou Dama and Ding Laogui is almost "much ado about nothing". It is obvious that: since the village in the grape specialty area (Nansha Village) has already scheduled to hold a temple fair, the problem of selling grapes will be solved, then, Zhou Dama does not need to sell the grapes eight days before the temple fair, and this quarrel does not have an inevitable reason. Moreover, if the grapes really have no sales at all, and there is no reliable way to prevent the grapes from rotting in the cooperative, then, comprehensively considering the interests of the masses, under this circumstance, Ding Laogui's failure to purchase the grapes cannot be regarded as a mistake. The mistake should be the blind leadership or allowing the farmers to grow grapes. On the basis of untrue plots, on this artificial contradiction, the author's subjective intention to criticize something has to fail.

    Some people may say: the author not only criticized Ding Laogui for not purchasing grapes, but also criticized him for never seeking a way out for grapes and neglecting the interests of the masses. In order to examine this issue, we must first understand whether the description of Ding Laogui is consistent with the character's personality? Ding Laogui in the work is a cadre from a farmer background who is loyal to the work of the cooperative. He has always cared about the interests of the masses, not only buying daily necessities for everyone, but also contributing to everyone's bumper harvest (buying waterwheels, fertilizers), and promoting the sale of everyone's products (cotton). It is a pity that he was powerless before the issue of buying grapes. Not only did he not dare to buy them, but he also did not understand their outlet and price. He is close to the farmers all day long, and the bumper harvest household Zhou Dama is still his in-law. He is active in the grape specialty area, and often goes to the city to buy goods. He knows that the farmers who produced grapes in the past few years have been exploited by merchants. Only this time, he did not care about the outlet of the grapes, and did not know the price of the grapes, and seemed to never know that there would be a temple fair in his village eight days later. Only when he quarreled with Zhou Dama and was criticized and stimulated from all sides did he feel that he had made a mistake - ideological conservatism and narrow vision, and he also easily changed his mistake. The character of such a person contains irreconcilable contradictions, so that it appears untrue. Attempting to use this untrue and atypical character to represent a certain idea, and criticizing this idea, this criticism is inevitably a shot in the dark.

    In order to criticize Ding Laogui's ideological conservatism and narrow vision, the author arranged a branch secretary who represents the Party and represents advanced ideas to say some big truths through his mouth. But as Ding Laogui's leader and critic, what reasons does this character have to be praised?

    If such a character image is used to represent the Party and represent advanced figures, this character is atypical and untrue, and therefore cannot represent the Party and advanced figures. Before the entanglement unfolded, he seemed to know that the grapes had a way out, and seemed to have everything in his chest (he said that grapes could be sold for "1,400 or 500 per catty", and "if they sell well, they can be sold for 1,600 or 700"). However, in the end, he could not come up with any solution. It turned out that he was not sure about anything. If it is said that because the scheduled temple fair can guarantee the outlet of the grapes, there is no need to be nosy beforehand, then why did he have to get involved in the entanglement beforehand and talk nonsense? This leader, who stood by before the incident, did not make much effort and struggle after the incident. He seems to be a leader, but he does not show any leadership role. The author later believed in an article that he was a bureaucrat [note], but the film obviously did not describe him in this way. Rather than being described as an object of criticism, he was described as an object of praise. The author attempted to create a positive character to fully clarify the basic theme, but achieved a bad effect.

    Since the contradictions are superficial and artificial, and can be easily resolved, the second half of the film appears empty. In order to remedy the emptiness, the author reluctantly made another misunderstanding between Zhou Dama and the director of the women's association. But this misunderstanding cannot help in remedying the emptiness, just like those insignificant plots and details are emphasized.

    The playwright and director obviously want to make the film full of joyful atmosphere. In this regard, the film has achieved some success. But the peasant life involved in the film cannot be said to be rich. Whether it is labor, family life, love, and hope for the future, it has not been fully and movingly depicted. The playwright and director rely too much on the cheapest methods: chorus and laughter. The girls in the film who repeatedly chorus and laugh loudly in any situation can hardly be said to be based on the truth of rural life. The characters are laughing anytime and anywhere, and the laughter is not based on much basis, which makes people feel the hypocrisy of the laughter and damages the truthfulness of the description. Because these untrue descriptions are emphasized, and their existence lacks a close connection with the basic theme, the educational role of the work will inevitably be reduced. Comrade Sun Qian, the playwright, has not had a long history in film screenplay work, but he has already written several screenplays. His efforts are successful and promising. We hope that he can take a further step forward from "When the Grapes Are Ripe" in his future work.

    评电影“葡萄熟了的时候”
    孙谦编剧　王家乙导演　东北电影制片厂出品
    王朝闻
    还在电影摄制以前，“葡萄熟了的时候”的文学剧本就已经得到了一些读者的赞扬和刊物的好评。影片放映以后，各地报刊又继续发表了一些推荐性的影评。这部作品之所以受到这些欢迎，我想，主要是由于它在一定程度上适应了人民的要求：描写我们今天的新生活以及新的农村气象。人民除了要看描写自己过去的痛苦生活和斗争历史的影片以外，他们渴望着要通过艺术形象，看看今天的新社会、新气象、人民的愉快的新生活。剧作者把自己的眼光和歌颂的热情，放在人民切身利益的主题和飞跃前进的新事物上，是值得欢迎和鼓励的。影片提出了农村生活中的一个重大问题——农产品的市场问题，并在这个问题的解决中，显示了国营经济、合作社经济对于农民的保护，以及对于不法商人的斗争。影片中的农民特别是农村青年男女表现出蓬蓬勃勃的朝气和在劳动中的愉快。剧本的结构，主要是前半部，有相当的戏剧性。由于这一切，观众对于影片的欢迎，是有理由的。
    尽管如此，应该指出，这一部影片还是有缺点的。指出这些缺点，将有利于新电影的进一步的发展。
    这部影片的题材，主要是表现合作社应不应该收购农民生产的葡萄。在这个问题的背后，本来存在着深刻的社会冲突（党、人民政府、合作社同不法私商之间的斗争，为人民利益而积极斗争的党组织、党的领导机关同不能为人民利益而积极斗争的党员、政府工作人员、合作社工作人员之间的斗争）。但是这部影片却没有认真展开这个深刻的冲突，而把它限制在狭小的、偶然的、不费力就可以解决的范围内，这使得主题大大地缩小了。在这样一个故事里，作者本来可以、也应该着力描写两种干部、两种思想的斗争，来阐明这一主题，即：党对人民利益的关怀，只有人民的利益是党的利益，党对一切忽视人民利益的现象作坚决的斗争。应该说，电影作者并不是没有触及到这一主题，作者确曾企图创造出合作社主任丁老贵的形象，来批评忽视群众利益的思想。可是，这一主题没有被作者所重视，只当成合作社方针问题的陪衬，也就没有被深刻地发掘和展开，而是轻轻地滑过了。剧本中虽则出现了和丁老贵对立的正面人物、代表党的领导的支部书记，但这个正面人物的出现，只是为了说明作者对合作社的见解，没有成为组成情节的不可缺少的部分，而且写得很不成功，因而与不正确的思想、作风相对立的正确的思想、作风和党的政策，都无从很好地表现出来。
    由于没有展开真实的冲突，在影片里就表现了矛盾的人为性和解决矛盾的偶然性。
    影片所描写的纠葛，发生在这样一种环境里：一个和党的领导、和合作社上级的领导、和城市等各方面都似乎很少联系的孤立的村庄；农民种了多年葡萄，全村多年都以葡萄为生，却不知道葡萄有没有销路，也不知道城里的葡萄酒厂已经开工，而且从来不考虑组织运销的问题。只有当周大妈和合作社主任大闹一场之后，当私商企图杀价购买葡萄之后，支部书记他们才被动地过问这一件事，而且只是依靠安装和修理水车的工人的偶然到来，他偶然想到城里的葡萄酒厂可能已经开工，帮助大家找出线索，才解决了葡萄的出路。这个环境是不现实的，矛盾的解决也是偶然的。
    为什么说这部片子的矛盾是人为的呢？因为：周大妈和丁老贵的纠葛，在作品里占据了重要的地位，可是按照故事的发展来看，周大妈和丁老贵的争吵，几乎是“庸人自扰”。很明显：既然葡萄特产区的村庄（南沙村）早已预定了要举办庙会，卖葡萄的问题就会解决，那么，周大妈没有在庙会前八天卖出葡萄的必要，这场争吵也就没有不可避免的理由。而且，如果葡萄真的根本没有销路，没有不让葡萄在合作社里烂掉的可靠办法，那么，全面地从群众利益着想，在这种情况之下，丁老贵不收购葡萄确也不能算是错误，错误的就应该是盲目地领导或听任农民种葡萄的人了。在不真实的情节基础上，在这种人为的矛盾上，作者批评什么的主观意图也就不得不落空。
    可能有人要说：作者不只是批评了丁老贵不收购葡萄，而且批评他从来不为葡萄谋出路，忽视群众利益。为了考察这一问题，首先要了解有关丁老贵的描写是否符合人物的性格？作品中的丁老贵，是一个忠于合作社工作的农民出身的干部。他一向关心群众利益，不仅为大家买日用品，而且为大家的丰产出了力（买水车、肥料），为大家推销过生产品（棉花）。只可惜他在收买葡萄这一问题之前无能为力。不仅不敢收买，而且对它的出路和价格一概不了解。他成天和农民接近，丰产户周大妈还是他的亲家，他活动在葡萄特产区，也常常进城办货，他知道前几年生产葡萄的农民受过商人的剥削。就是这一次不关心葡萄的出路，也不知道葡萄的价格，而且似乎从来不知道八天之后本村有一个庙会。只有当他和周大妈争吵而且受到各方面的批评和刺激之后，才感到自己犯了错误——思想保守和眼光狭小，而且也很容易地改变了错误。这样的人物的性格含有不能统一的矛盾，以致显得不真实。企图用这种不真实不典型的人物代表一定的思想，而且批评这种思想，这种批评难免成为无的放矢。
    为了批评丁老贵的思想保守和眼光狭小，作者安排了一个代表党、代表先进思想的支部书记，借他的嘴来讲一些大道理。但是作为丁老贵的领导者和批评者的支部书记，这个人物究竟有什么值得赞扬的理由呢？
    如果把这样的人物形象来代表党、代表先进人物，这个人物是不典型不真实的，因此也是不能代表党和先进人物的。在纠葛没有展开之前，他似乎就知道葡萄有出路，似乎一切都胸有成竹（他说葡萄每斤“可以卖一千四、五”，“卖得好可卖一千六、七”）。可是，临了却拿不出任何办法，原来他也是一切都没有把握。如果说因为预定的庙会可以保证葡萄的出路，用不着事前多事，那么，为什么在事前又不得不卷进纠葛里去，说说空话呢？这一位事前袖手旁观的领导者，事情发生之后，也没有作多少努力与奋斗。他好像是一个领导人，却什么领导作用也显不出来。作者后来在一篇文章里认为他是一个官僚主义者〔注〕，但是影片里显然不是这样描写的。与其说是当成被批评的对象来描写的，不如说是当成被赞扬的对象来描写的。作者企图创造一个正面人物从而充分阐明基本的主题，可是得到了不好的效果。
    矛盾既然是表面的，人为的，很容易就可以解决的，因此影片的下半部就显得空虚了。为了补救空虚，作者勉强使周大妈和妇女会主任之间又发生了一次误会。但是这个误会在补救空虚方面却不能有什么帮助，如同那些不值得强调的情节和细节被强调了一样。
    剧作者和导演显然要使影片充满欢乐的空气。在这方面，影片得到了一部分的成功。但是影片所涉及的农民生活，不能说是丰富的，无论是劳动、家庭生活、爱情和对于未来生活的希望，都没有得到充分的动人的描写。剧作者和导演过于仰赖最廉价的办法：合唱和欢笑。影片中一再合唱和不论什么情况下都可以齐声大笑的女孩子，很难说是根据于农村生活的真实。人物随时随地都在笑，笑得没有多少根据，使人感到笑的虚伪，损害了描写的真实性。因为这些不真实的描写被强调，它们的存在和基本的主题缺乏紧密的联系，作品的教育作用必然就会降低了。剧作者孙谦同志在电影编剧工作上历史不久，但已经写了好几个剧本，他的努力是有成绩的，有前途的。我们希望他能在今后的工作中，从“葡萄熟了的时候”更前进一步。
