    We Must Build on Achievement and Be Models Among Models
    ——The Story of Sanitary Model Li Fugan and Volunteer Army Merit Recipient Li Zhaoyun, Father and Son, Competing in Challenges
    Qiu Ming
    On February 10th, at the award ceremony for patriotic hygiene model workers held by the Jinan Railway Administration, I interviewed Li Fugan, an old man who was named a first-class sanitary model by the Ministry of Railways. Li Fugan is a retired old worker, and he is sixty-six years old this year. People praised his exemplary deeds in the patriotic hygiene movement with respect and excitement, praised his heroic son who had performed meritorious service on the Korean front line, and praised the story of their father and son challenging each other. Many people I met praised in unison: This is truly a case of "a heroic father and a good son."
    From the age of twenty, Li Fugan worked in the foundry of the Puzhen Railway Factory. In the old society, he was one of countless enslaved and despised worker brothers. He worked for forty-two years and was still a handyman. After liberation, this long-time laboring old worker was valued and respected. He was promoted to cleaning worker, and his salary was also increased. In 1951, because he was too old, he requested to retire. According to the labor insurance regulations promulgated by the Central People's Government, he enjoyed old-age treatment and lived a happy and free old age.
    The American aggressors launched the war of aggression against Korea, an evil act that destroyed the happy lives of the Chinese and Korean people, arousing the infinite anger of this old worker. He dedicated his old age to the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. First, he encouraged his son, Li Zhaoyun (a car inspector at the Pukou Vehicle Depot), to go to the front line to fight the American aggressors. In July 1951, Li Zhaoyun joined the volunteer transport team to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    Last spring, after the American aggressors' crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China were exposed, Old Man Li Fugan felt that he could no longer stay quietly at home. He actively responded to the government's call and joined the vigorous patriotic hygiene movement with the staff and family members. He often thought: "My son is already fighting American devils in Korea. In the rear, I must take the lead in doing a good job in patriotic hygiene work to defeat the American devils' bacteriological warfare. Eliminating one more pest is equivalent to eliminating one more American devil."
    Originally, Old Man Li's family life was quite comfortable, and he didn't need to worry about anything at home, so he devoted himself wholeheartedly to sanitation work. Throughout the summer, he kept his fly swatter in hand, looking for flies to swat everywhere. At night, he carried a DDT sprayer and looked for places with many mosquitoes to spray, often working until midnight. Someone asked him, "Uncle Li, are you tired?" He raised the sprayer and replied, "This is like a machine gun, swatting mosquitoes is like fighting American devils, the more I fight, the more energetic I become." The old man's enthusiasm encouraged the workers' families in the neighborhood to actively participate in patriotic hygiene work.
    He lived in the railway workers' dormitory on Yutang Street in Puzhen, near the suburbs, and there were many mosquito larvae in the nearby ponds. He thought, "To completely eliminate mosquitoes, we must eliminate mosquito larvae." He used a piece of thin foreign cloth to make a bag about the size of a flour sack, sewed an iron wire ring on the mouth of the bag, and tied it to a bamboo pole about ten feet long, making a tool for scooping up mosquito larvae.
    In the hot weather, mosquito larvae are afraid of the sun and sink to the bottom of the water. He was very anxious because he could not scoop them up. Later, he figured out the temperament of the mosquito larvae. He found that mosquito larvae floated to the surface of the water when it was cool at night, so he got up in the middle of the night, lit a small kerosene lamp, carried a tin bucket for mosquito larvae, and took the tool for scooping mosquito larvae to the nearby ponds to scoop them up. He scooped until dawn, each time scooping up two or three pounds of mosquito larvae.
    The people nearby were all moved by the spirit of Old Man Li and learned his method to scoop up mosquito larvae.
    Last August, Old Man Li received good news. His son, Li Zhaoyun, had performed meritorious service in Korea, and the news of his meritorious service was sent back. The chairman of the section trade union and the worker comrades came to his home to congratulate him with joy. Someone asked him, "Uncle Li, what are your thoughts now that your son has performed meritorious service?" He trembled with excitement and said, "I can't be shorter than my son, I must also achieve results in patriotic hygiene work." From then on, he worked even harder to kill pests, catch rats, and clean up sanitation.
    In a summer and an autumn, he led everyone to pull out the weeds nearby, and also dredged a ditch five feet wide and sixty feet long. He personally scooped up a total of two hundred and thirty-six pounds of mosquito larvae, extinguished more than eighty thousand mosquitoes and flies, and also blocked rat holes and caught six rats.
    In winter, when there were no flies and mosquitoes, he went to dig fly pupae. He took a shovel, tweezers, and an old enamel jar to the nearby latrines and other places with fly pupae, and went to dig all day long.
    Last December, Old Man Li was named a first-class sanitary model by the Ministry of Railways. People nearby came to congratulate him. He asked someone to write a letter telling his son in Korea about this. Li Zhaoyun was extremely happy to hear this news, and he wrote back from Korea, saying, "This is truly like an iron tree blooming!" At the same time, he proposed in his letter that he would strive to build on achievement in Korea and compete with his father!
    At the award ceremony held by the Jinan Railway Administration this time, Old Man Li wore a new dark blue twill coat, with a red ribbon that read "Sanitary Model Worker" hanging on his chest, and sat in the glorious seat of the model representatives. His wrinkled face shone with a smiling red glow. Mou Youmin, Deputy Director of the Jinan Railway Administration, awarded him the glorious medal, certificate, and bonus on behalf of the leaders of the Ministry of Railways.
    Someone mentioned his son's challenge and asked him, "Uncle Li, will you accept the challenge?"
     "How could I not accept the challenge?" He rubbed his hands with a smile and said, "After I go home, I will definitely convey the spirit of the conference to the nearby families, so that everyone will be mobilized to continue to do a good job in the patriotic hygiene movement and completely defeat the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. I want to make everyone strive to be a sanitation model; as for myself, I must compete with my son, ask him to strive to build on achievement, and I will strive to be a model among models!"

    我们要功上加功，模范上加模范
    ——卫生模范李福干、志愿军功臣李兆云父子挑战的故事
    秋明
    二月十日，在济南铁路管理局举行的爱国卫生模范工作者给奖大会上，我访问了被评为铁道部一等卫生模范的李福干老大爷。李福干是已经退休的老工人，今年六十六岁了。人们以尊敬和兴奋的心情赞扬着他在爱国卫生运动中的模范事迹，赞扬着他的在朝鲜前线立了功的英雄儿子，赞扬着他们父子挑战的故事。我遇见的许多人，都是异口同声地称赞着：这真是“老子英雄，儿子好汉”。
    打从二十岁起，李福干就在浦镇铁路工厂翻砂场干活。在旧社会里，他是无数被奴役、被鄙视的工人兄弟中的一个，他一直干了四十二年，还是当个杂工。解放以后，这个多年劳动的老工人才受到了重视和尊敬，他被提升为清铲工，工资也增加了。一九五一年，因为自己年纪太大，他请求退休了。根据中央人民政府公布的劳动保险条例，他享受着养老的待遇，愉快地、自由自在地过着幸福的老年生活。
    美国侵略者发动侵朝战争，破坏中朝两国人民幸福生活的万恶行为，激起了这个老年工人的无限愤怒，他把自己的老年献给了抗美援朝的伟大斗争。首先，他鼓励他的儿子李兆云（浦口车辆段的检车工）走上前线去打击美国侵略者。一九五一年七月，李兆云参加了抗美援朝志愿运输队。
    去年春天，美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北等地进行细菌战的罪行被揭发以后，李福干老大爷觉得自己再也不能安安静静地呆在家里了。他积极响应政府的号召，和职工家属们一道投入了轰轰烈烈的爱国卫生运动。他常常想：“我儿子已在朝鲜打美国鬼子，我在后方一定要带头搞好爱国卫生工作，打败美国鬼子的细菌战。多消灭一个毒虫，也是等于多消灭一个美国鬼子。”
    本来，李老大爷的家庭生活是挺安适的，家里的事一点也用不着他操心，于是，他就专心专意地去做卫生工作。整个夏天，他苍蝇拍子不离手，到处找苍蝇打。晚上，他端着“滴滴涕”喷射器，专找蚊子多的地方去喷射，时常工作到半夜。有人问他：“李大爷，你累吧？”他把喷射器一扬，回答道：“我这好比机关枪，打蚊子就好比打美国鬼子，越打越有劲。”老年人的这股子热劲，鼓舞了左邻右舍的工人家属们，都积极参加了爱国卫生工作。
    他家住在浦镇裕堂街铁路职工宿舍，靠近郊外，附近池塘里有很多孑孓。他想：“要彻底消灭蚊子，必须消灭孑孓。”他就用一块稀洋布做成一个面粉袋一般大的袋子，袋子口上缝上一个铁丝圈，扎在
    一根丈把长的竹竿上，做成一个打捞孑孓的工具。
    大热天，孑孓怕太阳，都沉到水底下，他捞来捞去捞不着，心里很着急。后来，他摸透了孑孓的脾气。他发现孑孓在夜天凉的时候浮出水面，于是，他在半夜里就起来，点着一盏小洋油灯，提着装孑孓的洋铁桶，拿着捞孑孓的工具到附近的塘边去打捞。一直捞天亮，每次可捞起两三斤孑孓。
    附近的人们，都被李老大爷的精神所感动，也学习他的办法来打捞孑孓。
    去年八月间，李老大爷接到了喜讯。他的儿子李兆云在朝鲜立了功，立功喜报寄回来了。段工会主席和工人同志们，欢天喜地到他家来道贺。有人问他：“李大爷，你儿子立了功，你有什么感想。”他兴奋得嘴唇直颤动说：“我不能比儿子矮一块，我也要在爱国卫生工作中搞出成绩来。”从这以后，他做灭虫、捕鼠和清洁卫生工作更起劲了。
    一个夏季和一个秋季，他带动大家把附近的野草拔光了，还把一条五尺宽、六十丈长的水沟疏通了。他个人一共打捞了二百三十六斤孑孓，扑灭了八万多只蚊子和苍蝇，还堵了鼠洞，捕了六只老鼠。
    冬天，苍蝇、蚊子没有了，他就去挖蝇蛹。他拿着铁锹、镊子和一个旧洋瓷缸，到附近的茅坑和其他有蝇蛹的地方，整天整天地去挖。
    去年十二月，李老大爷被评为铁道部一等卫生模范。附近的人们纷纷来给他道喜。他叫人把这事写信告诉了在朝鲜的儿子。李兆云听到这个消息高兴极了，他从朝鲜回信说：“这真是铁树开花啦！”同时，他在信里提出，要在朝鲜争取功上加功，和爸爸挑战竞赛！
    在济南铁路管理局这次举行的给奖大会上，李老大爷穿着蓝斜纹布的新大衣，胸前挂着“卫生模范工作者”的红条，坐在模范代表们的光荣席位上。他那满布皱纹的脸上闪耀着欢笑的红光。济南铁路管理局牟友民副局长代表铁道部首长，把光荣的奖章、奖状和奖金授给了他。
    有人提起他儿子挑战的事，问他：“李大爷，你应战吗？”
     “那能不应战？”他笑眯眯地搓了搓手说：“我回家后，一定把大会的精神向附近家属们好好传达，让大伙都动员起来，继续搞好爱国卫生运动，彻底打败美帝国主义的细菌战。我要叫人人争取当卫生模范；自己呢，一定和儿子竞赛，叫他争取功上加功，我争取模范上加模范！”
