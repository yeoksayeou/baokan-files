The Jiyuan County Branch of the People's Bank of China, the Jiyuan County Cooperative Union, and the Jiyuan County Agricultural Technology Guidance Station signed a three-way "joint contract" on February 16, covering fertilizer supply, loan issuance, and technical guidance, to systematically help farmers solve problems related to fertilizer deficiency and fertilization technology in wheat fields. Since the implementation of the contract, they have successfully completed the task of lending and supplying 525,500 jin of oil cake fertilizer and 15,000 jin of chemical fertilizer. This has enabled 2 agricultural production cooperatives, 207 mutual aid teams, and some individual farmers, totaling 2,338 households, to overcome difficulties in production investment and ensured that 12,000 mu of fertilizer-deficient wheat fields received timely topdressing.

The contract mainly stipulates that under the unified leadership of the County People's Government Production Committee, the bank must handle loans on time, the Cooperative Union must guarantee full supply by region, and the Guidance Station must teach fertilization techniques, in order to achieve "timely supply, technical follow-up, and appropriate loans." The other provisions in the contract are all based on this general requirement. It specifically stipulates the type, quantity, price, supply time, and fertilizer collection location of the loaned fertilizer, and also stipulates the procedures for borrowers to redeem fertilizer. The Guidance Station must promptly promote good fertilization methods and go to key areas for guidance. The contract also emphasizes that the three parties should jointly organize forces, in conjunction with cadres from various districts and townships, to vigorously publicize production policies and prevent any phenomena of coercion or equal apportionment.

In the process of implementing the contract, the three parties, through unified planning, also extracted 34 cadres to go deep into rural areas to carry out work in separate groups. In just half a month, they smoothly completed complex tasks such as lending and imparting technology. Compared with last year, it not only saved two-thirds of the manpower but also effectively prevented the phenomenon of forced orders for blind apportionment. The Agricultural Technology Guidance Station originally had only 12 people, and it was impossible to universally go deep into various villages to guide farmers in fertilization techniques. At the enlarged cadre meeting of grassroots cooperatives convened by the County Cooperative Union, they first taught the fertilization techniques to these grassroots cooperative cadres, who then passed them on to the broad masses, resulting in good results. For example, Wang Yumei, a military dependent in Dayu Township, said: "The People's Government helped me buy fertilizer and taught me technology, which has made it easier to increase production. I want to compete with my husband. He is making contributions on the front lines in Korea, and I want to strive to be a production model in the rear."

### 济源县银行、合作社和技术指导站订结合合同  帮助农民解决了麦田缺肥和施肥技术困难

    济源县银行、合作社和技术指导站订结合合同
    帮助农民解决了麦田缺肥和施肥技术困难
    中国人民银行河南省济源县支行、济源县合作社联合社，和济源县农业技术指导站，曾于二月十六日，签订了供应肥料、发放贷款和技术指导三方面的“结合合同”，有计划地帮助农民解决小麦田缺肥和施肥技术问题。自执行合同以来，已胜利地完成了贷放、供应油粕肥料五十二万五千五百斤、化学肥料一万五千斤的任务。使两个农业生产合作社、二百零七个互助组和部分个体农民，共二千三百三十八户，克服了生产投资的困难。使一万二千亩缺肥麦田，及时上好追肥。
    合同上所订的内容，主要是规定在县人民政府生产委员会的统一领导下，银行要按时办好贷放，合作社联合社要保证分区足数供应，指导站要教会施肥技术，以达到“供应及时、技术跟上、贷款恰当”。合同上所规定的其他各条，都是根据这一总要求出发。它具体地规定了出贷肥料的种类、数量、价格、供应时间和取肥地点，又规定了贷户兑付肥料的手续。指导站要及时推广好施肥方法，并要亲到重点地区指导。合同最后还强调三方面要共同组织力量，结合各区、乡干部，大力地宣传生产政策，防止发生任何强迫命令和平均摊派的现象。
    三方面在执行合同的过程中，经统一计划，又抽出三十四名干部分头深入各地农村开展工作，在前后仅半个月中，就顺利地完成了贷放和传授技术等复杂工作。和去年比较，不但节省了三分之二的人力，又有效地防止了盲目分摊的强迫命令现象。农业技术指导站原只有十二人，要普遍地深入各村指导农民施肥技术是办不到的。他们在县合作社联合社所召开的基层社扩大干部会上，就首先教会了这些基层社干部的施肥技术，通过他们再把它向广大群众传授，结果效果良好。如大峪乡军属王玉美说：“人民政府帮助我买肥料，教技术，增产更有了条件。我要和爱人比赛，他在朝鲜前线立功，我在后方要争取做增产模范。”
