    Summarizing the Achievements of Mass Discussion
    Northeast Machinery Factory No. 18 Formulates Advanced Plan
    After the staff and workers conscientiously discussed the various indicators stipulated by the state, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 18 formulated the factory's striving plan, deciding to take exceeding the state production plan by 28.2 percent as the goal of struggle.
    In order to consolidate the achievements of the plan discussion, the factory is now organizing three professional groups to solve problems separately, based on the rationalization proposals and tricks put forward by the masses, the production management problems exposed during the discussion process, and the weak links exposed when formulating the factory plan. One is the technical organization measures planning group, which specializes in comprehensively analyzing the rationalization proposals, tricks, and improvement opinions put forward by all factory employees, focusing on key points according to plan requirements, and proposing solutions and steps. The second is the department and workshop liaison contract group, which focuses on the opinions put forward by the masses in this regard, studies and establishes a normal liaison system between departments and between departments and workshops, and consolidates the original system. There is also a collective contract drafting group. These tasks are carried out by combining leadership and the masses. At the same time, the masses are mobilized to review tricks, implement tricks, and demonstrate tricks, and forces are organized to strengthen weak links, in order to comprehensively and evenly complete the established plan.

    归纳群众讨论的成果
    东北机械十八厂订出先进计划
    东北机械十八厂在职工认真地讨论了国家规定的各项指标之后，订出了全厂的争取计划，决定以超过国家生产计划百分之二十八点二作为奋斗目标。
    为巩固讨论计划的成绩，现在该厂正在根据群众提出的合理化建议和窍门，根据讨论过程中暴露出来的生产管理上的问题，和订全厂计划时暴露出来的薄弱环节，组织了三个专业小组来分头解决。一个是技术组织措施计划小组，专门集中全厂职工提出的合理化建议、窍门和改进意见，进行全面分析，按计划要求，抓住重点，提出解决方案和步骤。第二个是科室与车间联系合同组，集中群众在这方面提出的意见，研究建立科室之间和科室与车间之间的正常联系制度，并巩固原有的制度。还有一个是集体合同起草小组。这些工作均采取领导与群众相结合的方法进行。与此同时，又发动群众审查窍门、实现窍门、表演窍门，组织力量加强薄弱环节，以达到全面地均衡地完成既定计划。
