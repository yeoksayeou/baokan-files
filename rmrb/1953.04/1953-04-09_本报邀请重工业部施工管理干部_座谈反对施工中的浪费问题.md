This Newspaper Invites Construction Management Cadres from the Ministry of Heavy Industry
To Discuss the Problem of Waste in Construction

The editorial department of this newspaper invited cadres from nine engineering companies under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, including company managers, site directors, engineers, construction section chiefs, and engineering team leaders—a total of nine people—to hold a forum to discuss how to oppose waste in construction departments.

The First Engineering Company of the Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration had a large workload last year. Major projects included the Northeast Electric Engineering Factory No. 4 plant buildings, the Harbin Institute of Technology building (six stories) and staff dormitories, the Harbin Higher Vocational School main building, and the Foreign Language College dormitory, among other projects. Serious waste occurred in these projects during construction. At the forum, Li Ganzhong, the company manager, spoke first. He said: "The phenomenon of waste in construction is very serious in our area. From the perspective of materials, due to blind procurement, untimely materials, and non-standard specifications, there are often work stoppages waiting for materials and rework waste, causing chaos in construction. By the end of last year, there was still an accumulation of 20 billion yuan worth of materials. For example, the Harbin Institute of Technology site over-stocked 3.5 million bricks, and transporting them to another site resulted in waste – not counting the losses en route, just the transportation cost alone wasted 150 million yuan. Some sites, after completion, still had bags or half-bags of lime found in piles of rubble. From the perspective of equipment and tools, many pieces of equipment are left idle, such as several cement mixers that were 'sleeping' from 1950 to 1951, only started for a few days last year, and then left idle again. The utilization rate of winches only reached 20%. The consumption of materials is astonishing. For example, for making model boards alone, a total of 10,000 cubic meters of wood were used last year, and only 40% was recovered after completion. Some construction sites damaged their mortar troughs after only one use. From the perspective of labor productivity, phenomena such as work stoppages waiting for electricity and water are very common; last year, in the three months of July, August, and September, an average of two hours per person per day were wasted. In financial management, there is also a lack of sound systems; last year, management expenses exceeded the regulations by one-third, and circulating funds only turned over twice a year (the Ministry of Heavy Industry stipulates five to six times). There is also significant waste in transportation; the unit load capacity of trucks is very low, and in reality, two-thirds of the vehicles are running empty."

Li Ganzhong then analyzed the reasons for the waste, believing that the main reason was the lack of economic accounting concepts among leading cadres. He said: "We pay close attention to the progress of projects; if there is any quality accident, we can't sleep at night, and we even guard the site overnight during the construction of important projects; but we don't pay attention to where there is waste, and even if we see waste, we don't take effective measures to stop it. At the beginning of construction last year, we also considered increasing production and practicing economy, but later, when the project became tight, over-budget expenditures were also approved." In addition, "there are still some old views among some grassroots construction cadres, mistakenly believing that waste is inevitable when building large buildings; some people not only do not accept criticism but also think you are making a fuss. Some construction personnel say they are only responsible for construction, and some technicians say they are only responsible for technology, and therefore turn a blind eye to waste." "As for the workers, most of them know how to cherish state property. For example, some workers automatically create clapper rhymes and lantern slides, using the 'complaints' of red bricks and wood as themes, to publicize the opposition to waste. However, due to insufficient education and unsound systems, some workers, especially temporary workers, also do not pay attention to saving; for example, some workers carry cement from the warehouse, and if the bag leaks, they don't care, and it's all spilled by the time they reach the construction site."

Comrade Li Ganzhong believes that opposing waste in construction is very necessary and timely, and must be carried out purposefully and methodically, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results.

Then eight comrades spoke successively, unanimously believing that the phenomenon of waste in construction is widespread and serious, and the incidents of waste are countless. Therefore, the topic focused on analyzing the causes of waste and how to launch an anti-waste movement. Many comrades cited facts to illustrate that the main reasons for waste are: the lack of economic accounting concepts among leading cadres and the absence of sound management systems. Zheng Jidi, director of the office of the Angang Mechanical Installation Company, said: "When the project was tight last August and September, all three managers went to the construction site, and no one cared about the work of the various departments. In order to catch up with the progress, unreasonable expenditures were also approved." A deputy engineer from the technology section of the Angang Metal Structure Engineering Company said: "Last year, a certain construction site transported 3,000 pieces of sleepers, pulling them around everywhere. If you don't let them take them, they say you will be responsible if the task is not completed, and the material management personnel are also helpless, so economic accounting is suppressed by the task." Due to the lack of systems, waste is inevitable. Zheng Jidi said: "There is no system for purchasing materials; they are bought as soon as they are requested, and if they can't be used, they are stockpiled." The company "wasted 300 million yuan in transportation costs for returning materials last year. Each small team has a small warehouse, and the surplus materials are not returned, but kept on hand for convenient use." "There is no organization to calculate costs, and the contract is signed very late, and the cadres below do not know the cost." Ye Shu, deputy leader of the engineering team of the Jilin Engineering Company of the Chemical Industry Bureau, said: "The lack of planned management is also a big loophole; workers and technicians do a little work at a time, wasting a lot."

When discussing how to launch a mass anti-waste movement, everyone believed that first and foremost, unblocking the thinking of leading cadres is the key to launching the movement, and mobilizing staff and technicians is the main link in mobilizing the masses. After widely exposing waste and the phenomenon of no one being responsible, the responsibility system must be established. Wan Nai, head of the construction technology section of the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, said: "The one-sided view of tasks comes from leading cadres; for example, last year we had to hold two meetings every week, only paying attention to tasks and not paying attention to saving, so unblocking the thinking of leading cadres is the first key." The phenomenon of no one being responsible is inseparable from bureaucracy, so "the anti-waste movement must be combined with the anti-bureaucracy movement, otherwise it will not be thorough." Gao Guimin, deputy director of the construction site of the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company, said: "Although some units have inspected in the past, they were not thorough. For example, our second construction site is full of sand and gravel, much of which is buried underground, and cannot be seen from the surface. If the masses are widely mobilized, more waste will be exposed. In the movement, the responsibility system must be established from top to bottom; if it is just a passing fad, it will not lay a solid foundation for the implementation of economic accounting." Ji Yan, head of the construction section of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Engineering Company, used his company as an example to illustrate the necessity of anti-waste for newly established units. He said: "Our company was only established this year, and waste occurred before construction even started, such as buying cars, steel wire beds, etc. Who let us buy them? The general manager said he didn't know, and the deputy manager didn't know either; no one is responsible. It is said that the steel that has been bought cannot be used, or will be used inefficiently. In addition, there is also the phenomenon of underemployment and waste of labor. It is very timely to launch an anti-waste movement now, and it is of great significance to this year's work."

    本报邀请重工业部施工管理干部
    座谈反对施工中的浪费问题
    本报编辑部曾邀请重工业部九个工程公司的干部，其中有公司经理、工地主任、工程师、施工科长及工程队长等九人，举行座谈会，座谈在施工部门中如何反对浪费的问题。
    东北有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司去年工作量很大，主要工程有东北电工四厂厂房，哈尔滨工业大学大楼（六层）及职工宿舍，哈尔滨高等职业学校主楼以及外国语专科学校宿舍等工程。这些工程在施工中曾发生严重浪费现象。在座谈会上，该公司经理李干忠首先发言。他说：“施工中的浪费现象在我们那里是很严重的。从材料上来看，由于盲目采购，材料不及时，不合规格，常常形成停工待料与返工浪费现象，造成施工中的混乱。至去年年终还积压二百多亿元的材料。如哈尔滨工业大学工地就多储备了三百五十万块砖，再运往另一工地，中途损失不算，只运费一项就浪费了一亿五千万元。有些工地竣工后，在烂堆中还可找出成袋或半袋的白灰来。从设备和工具上来看，不少设备闲置不用，如有几台洋灰搅拌机从一九五○年到一九五一年一直在睡觉，去年只开动了几天又闲下来。卷扬机的利用率只达百分之二十。材料的消耗是很惊人的，如制模型板一项去年共用木材一万立方公尺，竣工后只收回来百分之四十。有的工地的灰槽子只用一次就损坏了。从劳动生产率来看，停工待电、停工待水等现象是很普遍的，去年七、八、九三个月份平均每人每天要浪费两小时。在财务管理上更缺乏健全制度，去年管理费的开支超出规定三分之一，流动资金一年只周转两次多（重工业部规定五至六次）。在运输方面浪费也很大，汽车单位载重量很低，实际相当于三分之二的车辆跑了空车。”
    李干忠接着分析造成浪费的原因，他认为主要原因是领导干部缺乏经济核算观点。他说：“我们对工程进度是很注意的，质量上出了什么事故，晚上睡不着觉，在重要工程施工时连夜守在那里；但却不注意那里有什么浪费，就是看到浪费现象也没有采取有效措施加以制止。去年开工时还考虑过增产节约的问题，后来工程紧张，超预算的开支也都批准了。”此外，“有些基层施工干部中还存在着旧观点，错认为盖大楼难免要有浪费，有的人不但不接受批评，反而认为你大惊小怪。有的施工人员说自己只管施工，有的技术人员说自己只管技术，因而对浪费现象熟视无睹。”“至于工人，大都知道爱护国家资财。如有些工人自动地编快板搞幻灯等，以红砖诉苦、木材诉苦为题目，作反对浪费现象的宣传。但由于教育不够与制度不健全，有些工人特别是临时工人也不注意节约，如有的工人从仓库背洋灰，袋子漏了也不管，背到工地都撒光了。”
    李干忠同志认为反对施工中的浪费是非常必要而且是适合时宜的。并必须有目的地有办法地去进行，否则就很难收效。
    接着有八位同志陆续发言，一致认为施工中的浪费现象是普遍而严重的，浪费事件数不清。因此话题集中到分析浪费原因和如何展开反浪费运动。很多同志列举事实说明产生浪费的主要原因是：领导干部缺乏经济核算观点和没有健全的管理制度。鞍钢机械安装公司办公室主任郑继迪说：“去年八至九月份工程紧张时，三个经理都下工地，各科室的工作无人过问。为了赶进度，不合理的开支也就批准。”鞍钢金属结构工程公司技术科副工程师说：“去年某工地运来三千根道木，到处乱拉，你不让拿，他就说任务完不成由你负责，材料管理人员也无可奈何，于是经济核算就被任务压下去了。”由于缺乏制度，浪费现象也就不可防止。郑继迪说：“采购材料没有制度，提出来就照买，不能用就积压下来。”该公司“去年退材料的运费就浪费三亿元。各小队都有小仓库，多余的材料不往回退，留在手头使用方便。”“没有计算成本的组织，包工合同订得很迟，下边的干部不知成本高低。”化工局吉林工程公司工程队副队长叶舒说：“没有计划管理也是个很大的漏洞，工人、技术人员来一点活干一点，浪费很多。”
    谈到如何开展群众性的反浪费运动时，大家认为首先打通领导干部的思想是开展运动的关键，把职员和技术人员发动起来是发动群众的主要环节，在广泛揭发浪费与无人负责现象之后一定要把责任制建立起来。重工业部直属建设工程公司施工技术科科长万耐说：“片面的任务观点来自领导干部，如去年每周要开两次会，只是注意任务而不注意节约，因此打通领导干部思想是第一个关键。”无人负责现象是与官僚主义分不开的，所以“反浪费运动必须与反官僚主义相结合，否则就搞不彻底。”本溪工业工程公司工地副主任高贵民说：“有些单位虽然过去检查过，但很不彻底。如我们第二工地沙石满地，很多都掩在地下，从表面上是看不出来的。如果广泛发动群众，一定会揭发出更多的浪费现象。在运动中要从上到下把责任制建立起来，如果一阵风刮过就算完事，就不能为实行经济核算打下巩固的基础。”石景山钢铁厂工程公司施工科长吉俨以该公司为例，说明新成立的单位也有反浪费的必要。他说：“我们公司今年才成立，没有开工就发生浪费现象，如买小汽车、钢丝床等。是谁让买的呢？正经理说不知道，副经理也不知道，无人负责。已买来的钢材据说不能用，或要大材小用。另外在劳动力上也发生窝工浪费现象。现在开展反浪费运动是很适时的，对今年的工作有重大意义。”
