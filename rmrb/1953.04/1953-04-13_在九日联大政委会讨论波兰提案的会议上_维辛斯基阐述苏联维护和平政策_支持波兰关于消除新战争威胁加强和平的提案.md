    Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 11th (TASS): Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky delivered a speech on April 9th at the United Nations General Assembly’s Political Committee during the discussion of the Polish proposal regarding "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War, Strengthen International Peace and Friendly Cooperation." He said: The Political Committee has begun considering, at the request of the Polish delegation, the issue of eliminating the threat of another world war and strengthening international peace and friendly cooperation. There is no need to specifically emphasize the extreme importance of this issue, as the proposals put forward by the Polish delegation primarily concern matters of vital interest to all peace-loving people: the cessation of the Korean War and the conclusion of an armistice agreement, the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the conclusion of a peace pact among the five great powers – the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, China, and France. The significant importance of this proposal by the Polish delegation was already pointed out at the beginning of the first half of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The proposal of the Polish delegation remains fully important now because the issues it addresses have not yet been resolved, and resolving these issues is one of the most important conditions for eliminating the threat of another world war, truly strengthening peace and international security, and strengthening international friendship. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union has been striving to end the Korean War for the third year and has also been striving for many years to resolve other important outstanding problems: such as the issue of reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing effective international control, and concluding a peace pact among the five great powers – the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, China, and France.

    Vyshinsky then pointed out: The Soviet Union's efforts to resolve these issues as quickly as possible stem from the entire direction of Soviet foreign policy, which is based, according to Joseph Stalin's brilliant definition, on the idea of peace, the struggle for international peace and friendship, and for strengthening and developing international cooperation. Soviet foreign policy is based on the premise that the opposition between the socialist system and the capitalist system does not preclude the possibility of cooperation and agreements between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. From the very first days of the Soviet state, from the Soviet government's first decree, the "Decree on Peace," until now, the Soviet government has been confidently and resolutely following the path of developing and strengthening international harmony and friendly relations, and the path of cooperating with all countries in resolving all international issues. Lenin and Stalin repeatedly emphasized the peaceful aims of the Soviet state's foreign policy. Lenin repeatedly pointed out that the aim of the Soviet state is peaceful economic construction, and peaceful construction "is the most important thing for us." In a 1927 conversation with the First American Workers' Delegation, Joseph Stalin, when discussing the issue of agreements between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries in the areas of industry, trade, and diplomacy, pointed out: "The existence of two opposing systems – the capitalist system and the socialist system – does not preclude the possibility of reaching such agreements." Joseph Stalin consistently pointed out that if there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and if the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then the peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is entirely possible.

    Vyshinsky said that this is the general direction of Soviet foreign policy that the Soviet Union has consistently pursued in the past and is currently pursuing.

    On March 9th, at the funeral of Joseph Stalin, the leaders of the Soviet government – Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, and Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov – spoke about the current foreign policy of the Soviet government. They all said that the goal of Soviet foreign policy will continue to be to maintain and consolidate peace, to fight against preparations for a new war, and that Soviet foreign policy will continue to be a policy of international cooperation with all countries that are also willing to cooperate on a mutually beneficial basis, a policy based on Lenin and Stalin's doctrine that the long-term peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation of two different systems, capitalism and socialism, is possible. Facts have long shown that if the measures on which both sides have already agreed regarding the immediate cessation of the Korean War are implemented, it will have a particularly significant impact on the cause of peace and the elimination of the threat of new war. There is no doubt that the outbreak of the Korean War increased the threat of a new world war. At the same time, there is no doubt that once the Korean War ceases, this threat will certainly be reduced, and many other unresolved problems that complicate international relations and hinder the consolidation of peace and international security will become easier to resolve. Among the major unresolved issues, it must be pointed out that special attention needs to be paid to the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces, the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing effective international control to implement this prohibition. The issue of reducing armaments and armed forces, prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing international control has long been a major task facing the United Nations General Assembly and has long been awaiting resolution.

    Everyone knows that as early as December 1946, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a decision stating that armaments and armed forces must be reduced as quickly as possible, and that the measures taken to solve this problem should apply not only to secondary weapons but also to the basic weapons in modern warfare. Everyone also knows that at that time, the United Nations General Assembly also adopted a resolution stating that studies on a convention to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international control and supervision must be accelerated in order to ensure that atomic energy is only used for peaceful purposes. At this time, we would like to particularly emphasize a part of this resolution, in which the United Nations General Assembly called on all member states of the United Nations to provide all assistance to the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Control Commission to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of international peace and collective security, so that the world's human and economic resources are wasted as little as possible on armaments. There is no need to emphasize that everyone can see how significant it would be if this resolution, or the provisions in this resolution, were implemented. However, it is very regrettable that these provisions have not yet been implemented, although there is absolutely no excuse to delay the active resolution of these important issues to any extent.

    Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky continued to point out that measures to strengthen armaments and increase armed forces, the establishment of new military bases and the expansion of existing bases in foreign territories, the refusal to prohibit atomic weapons, the expansion of atomic bomb production, and the corresponding propaganda carried out simultaneously – all of these things inevitably contribute to the further deterioration of international tensions. These measures undoubtedly undermine trust between countries, reduce the possibility of eliminating the threat of new war, weaken the possibility of rapprochement and cooperation between countries, and thus hinder the consolidation of peace and international security.

    Speaking of the organization of military alliances, without a doubt, it is precisely this kind of measure that undermines international trust, rather than promoting the improvement of international relations. This kind of measure has contributed to, and cannot but contribute to, the deterioration of relations between countries, which breeds international tension and conflict. A broad segment of public opinion in Western countries is also increasingly recognizing this. Under their influence, even newspapers such as France's "Le Monde" often publish comments criticizing the policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying: "All the policies and strategies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are for conducting the Cold War, if not for conducting war." It is clear that such a policy cannot promote the consolidation of peaceful relations between countries. In addition, it should also be pointed out that the planners and masterminds of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization insist that the task of this group is a so-called defensive task, but since there is the United Nations, there is no reason whatsoever to organize such a group, because the United Nations was established to unite the strength of all peoples to maintain peace and security. Vyshinsky further pointed out that at this session of the General Assembly, the Soviet Union, as in previous sessions of the General Assembly, firmly advocates the reduction of armaments and armed forces. In its proposal, the Polish delegation proposed to the General Assembly: in order to prevent the threat of a new world war, it is recommended that "the governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Great Britain, France, and China, the permanent members of the Security Council, each reduce their armed forces, including air force, navy, and auxiliary forces, by one-third within a year, and submit all information on their national armaments, and also recommend that the Security Council convene an international conference in the shortest possible time to reduce the armed forces of all countries." Not long ago, when the Soviet delegation spoke on the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces, it analyzed in detail the speeches of the American and British representatives criticizing the Soviet disarmament proposals and reminded the committee that the purpose of the Soviet proposals was to truly reduce armed forces and armaments. At the same time, the Soviet representative pointed out that the proposals insisted upon by the American and British representatives on this issue are unreasonable. These proposals not only failed to mention the important issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons, but also completely failed to mention any measures to reduce armaments and armed forces. The Soviet delegation believes that the current proposal put forward by the Polish delegation, that the five great powers each reduce their armed forces, including air force, navy, and auxiliary forces, by one-third within a year, is entirely effective. And the American, British, and French representatives opposed this proposal, and they put forward their own proposals, advocating the so-called reporting and inspection of information on all armed forces and armaments.

    However, the provision of corresponding information on armaments or armed forces mentioned in this proposal cannot be regarded as a measure to reduce armaments and armed forces, and the American, British, and French representatives intend to implement the so-called reporting and inspection in such an order, which puts the reporting and inspection of the most important and most secret weapons and installations to the latest time, and even fails to set any clear time for this. The Soviet Union has not agreed and does not agree to this so-called plan to reduce armaments and armed forces, because this plan has virtually nothing in common with the task of truly reducing armaments and armed forces. The Polish delegation's proposal, like the similar proposals previously put forward by the Soviet Union, links the issue of reducing so-called general armaments and armed forces with the adoption of measures to prohibit atomic weapons. The Polish proposal calls for the immediate adoption of a resolution to unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass slaughter, and to establish strict international control to supervise the implementation of this resolution by all countries. This issue has also not been agreed upon until now, because there are many serious differences in the plans, methods, and ways to solve this issue. As everyone knows, the representatives of the United States, Great Britain, and some other countries that support them take the so-called Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal plan as the basis of their proposals on solving the atomic issue, believing that this plan is the best. In previous sessions, we have pointed out in detail that this view is unreasonable, and we have cited many facts as evidence, including
    the opinions of some authoritative atomic scientists, who confirmed some of the biggest shortcomings of the Baruch plan, which made it impossible to reach any agreement on the basis of this plan. As everyone knows, Bernard, the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation Committee who once helped draft the Baruch plan, also believes that this plan is currently insufficient. Lilienthal, one of the drafters of this plan, said not long ago that this plan cannot be adopted now and cannot even be allowed to exist. Last year, an article was published in the "Congressional Record" magazine entitled: "The Final Demand for Atomic Energy Control," which pointed out that the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission has long abandoned the so-called majority plan, the so-called Baruch plan. However, the United States, Great Britain, and France insisted on this plan in Paris last year and are also insisting on this plan in New York this year, although atomic experts have warned that under the current conditions, this plan is no longer suitable and is outdated.

    The American newspapers themselves openly said that the basis of the Baruch plan is incorrect imagination and errors, and this error occurred because the development of atomic science has exceeded the imagination of the drafters of this plan. Everyone openly said that the Baruch plan is outdated. Because this plan is based on the United States' monopoly on atomic energy, so while the United States lost its monopoly on atomic energy, it also lost its meaning. Although the supporters of this plan tried every means to save the Baruch plan, they were unable to prove the slightest advantage of this plan and the proposals based on it to solve the atomic issue, so they tried to say that the Soviet Union's proposals on this issue were unrealistic. However, the real intention of these statements is to reject the just proposal that meets the requirements of human conscience and morality to unconditionally and immediately prohibit atomic weapons. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union advocates that the United Nations General Assembly adopt a resolution on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. Atomic weapons are weapons of offense and aggression. Peace-loving people, all those who oppose aggressive plots and aggression, cannot recognize them as valuable. The Soviet Union, which opposes any aggressive plans and aggressive plots, firmly demands that the atomic bomb be eliminated from armaments, and the United Nations General Assembly's declaration of unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons can produce such a result.

    The Polish proposal also includes: calling on all countries that have not participated in or ratified the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons to participate in or ratify this convention. This issue has been discussed in the Political Committee, so there is no need to talk about its substance again, nor is there any need to list the facts of the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and the destruction of the 1925 Geneva Protocol again. These facts have been confirmed by some authoritative international committees and many witnesses in an absolutely objective manner and have been discussed in the Political Committee. Vyshinsky
    went on to emphasize that, therefore, the call to participate in or ratify the Geneva Protocol is in the fundamental interests of all peace-loving people, and contributes to the cause of peace and international security. The Soviet Union fully supports this proposal of the Polish delegation.

    Vyshinsky then spoke about the Korean issue, saying: Recently, major events have occurred. As everyone knows, Kim Il-sung, the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, stated in their reply to General Clark, the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces in Korea, that they agreed to exchange seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war in accordance with Article 109 of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

    Vyshinsky said that it should be reminded that as early as July 15, 1950, three weeks after the outbreak of the Korean War, Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet government, pointed out in his reply to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, that the most reasonable way to quickly resolve the Korean issue was to listen to the opinions of the Korean people in the Security Council. Efforts to promote a just armistice and end the Korean War began from then on. On July 10, 1951, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, armistice negotiations began in Kaesong and later continued in Panmunjom. As a result, all issues except the issue of exchanging prisoners of war were almost completely agreed upon. Vyshinsky continued to say that Zhou Enlai's statement on March 30th and Kim Il-sung's statement on March 31st pointed out that they had jointly studied the suggestion made by General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war. The governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China had jointly replied to Clark's letter. Their statements pointed out that the rational solution to the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war is of great significance for the smooth resolution of the entire issue of prisoners of war. It should be said that the time to resolve all prisoner of war issues to guarantee the cessation of the Korean War and the conclusion of an armistice agreement has arrived. Zhou Enlai's statement solemnly pointed out: In the Korean armistice negotiations, only the prisoner of war issue is hindering the realization of the Korean armistice. "If the Korean armistice negotiations had not been interrupted for more than five months, this prisoner of war repatriation issue might have been resolved long ago." Zhou Enlai pointed out: "With the rational resolution of the sick and wounded prisoner of war issue, as long as both sides truly have the sincerity to make mutual concessions to promote the Korean armistice, the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue should be entirely possible." Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, emphasized that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hopes to quickly stop the future bloodshed and is prepared to take measures to strive to reach an agreement on the Korean armistice in accordance with the various recommendations in Zhou Enlai's statement. Premier Kim Il-sung said that these recommendations are "not only new measures for the smooth resolution of the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war, but also for the smooth resolution of the repatriation issue of all prisoners of war, which remains the only obstacle to reaching an armistice agreement." This is the consistent position of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China on the comprehensive resolution of all prisoner of war issues. The Soviet Union supports the noble actions of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on this issue. The Soviet Union warmly supports the proposal to resume Korean negotiations to reach an agreement on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war and to resolve the entire issue of prisoners of war, thereby resolving the issue of the Korean armistice and the conclusion of an armistice agreement. We have pointed out that the long-term negotiations in Panmunjom have not achieved positive results on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. This issue should of course be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention, which is what the Soviet government, as well as the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have insisted on. As everyone knows, the repeated discussions on this issue in the United Nations General Assembly have not produced positive results. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung stated that the differences between the two sides on the issue of prisoners of war are currently the only obstacle to reaching a Korean armistice. Zhou Enlai said: "Only because ending the bloody war in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue are related to the peace and security of the people in the Far East and the world, we have taken this new step and prepared to transfer our captured personnel who are afraid to return home under the intimidation and pressure of the other side to neutral countries after the armistice, and after the explanation of relevant parties, to ensure that their repatriation issues can be fairly resolved, and not hinder the realization of the Korean armistice." Premier Kim Il-sung also made a similar statement. On April 1st of this year, V.M. Molotov stated on this issue that the Soviet government believes that this proposal of the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is completely just, and expressed its willingness to do its best to promote its realization. V.M. Molotov said: "There is no doubt that the people of the world and those who sincerely hope to end the Korean War and promote the consolidation of peace and security for the people of the Far East and the world will welcome this proposal with warm sympathy and give it full support."

    This fact cannot be ignored: if the Korean people and the Chinese people had their own legitimate representatives in the United Nations, then the United Nations would have been able to smoothly resolve the issue of the armistice and the end of the Korean War long ago, because without their representatives, the United Nations loses the possibility of smoothly resolving important issues related to consolidating peace and ensuring international security. The Soviet government considers it its responsibility to reiterate that the issue of the legitimate representation of the Chinese people and the Korean people in the United Nations is one of the most important issues, and it is imperative to make a positive decision on this issue. The sooner this issue is positively decided, the more beneficial it will be to consolidate world peace and consolidate the international prestige of the United Nations organization. The Soviet delegation is deeply convinced that the noble initiative of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will receive the full support of the United Nations, military operations on land, sea, and air will be completely stopped, and therefore the war will end, and the peace that the peace-loving people of the world firmly demand and warmly hope for will be restored in Korea.

    Vyshinsky continued to point out that the Soviet delegation fully agrees with the Polish delegation's proposal, which calls on the General Assembly to recommend that the two sides fighting in Korea immediately resume armistice negotiations. Vyshinsky expressed his belief that both sides will do their utmost to reach an agreement on the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war and the entire issue of prisoners of war, and will do their best to eliminate the obstacles hindering the end of the Korean War. He said that ending the Korean War and signing an armistice agreement are one of the most important links in the measures to eliminate the threat of a new world war and consolidate peace and international security.

    The Soviet delegation strongly supports the proposal put forward by the Polish delegation to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers – the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, China, and France. Hundreds of millions of people have expressed their firm will to strive for peace. The United Nations organization should assume its own responsibilities and should issue a call for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers – the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, China, and France – as soon as possible. The peace-loving people of the world justly believe that this pact is a guarantee of a consolidated and lasting peace in the world. The Soviet Union has consistently and firmly implemented its own policy, defending the cause of peace and international cooperation. The billions of people around the world who hate war and yearn for peace and happiness are concerned about the success of this great and noble cause.

    In recent days, authoritative figures from the United States and Great Britain have issued some statements related to the diplomatic situation. President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and British Foreign Secretary Eden have recently expressed their views on the current international situation. They pay special attention to the so-called rearmament policy and all its consequences. However, it can be predicted in advance that such a policy will not bring good results, just as it has not had good results in the past, and it does not have good results now. As for the Soviet Union, as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov said, the Soviet Union is mainly concerned with "preventing new wars and living in peace with all countries." The leader of the Soviet government pointed out that "the most correct, necessary, and just foreign policy is an effective international peace policy based on facts and verified by facts, and based on mutual trust." The Soviet Union, in the past, present, and future, has always unswervingly followed the great principle of its own foreign policy – the policy of international peace – which fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and all peace-loving people.

    在九日联大政委会讨论波兰提案的会议上
    维辛斯基阐述苏联维护和平政策
    支持波兰关于消除新战争威胁加强和平的提案
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十一日电：安·扬·维辛斯基九日在联合国大会政治委员会讨论波兰提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的措施”提案时发表演说。他说：政治委员会已着手审议根据波兰代表团的请求而列入议程的关于消除另一次世界大战威胁、加强国际和平与友好合作的问题。没有必要再特别讲一讲这个问题的非常的重要性，因为波兰代表团所提的建议首先就是关于下面这样一些涉及一切爱好和平人民切身利益的问题：关于停止朝鲜战争和缔结停战协定的问题、裁减军备、禁止原子武器、缔结五大国——苏联、美国、英国、中国和法国——和平公约等问题。在联合国第七届大会前半期会议开始时，就已有人指出波兰代表团这个建议的重要意义了。波兰代表团的建议现在仍然完全保有它的重要意义，因为它所涉及的问题仍然没有得到解决，而这些问题的解决是消除另一次世界大战威胁、真正加强和平与国际安全以及加强国际友好的最重要的条件之一。也正是由于这个原因，苏联已经是第三年力求停止朝鲜战争了，苏联许多年来也一直力求解决其他尚未解决的重要问题：如裁减军备、禁止原子武器并建立有效的国际管制、缔结苏美英中法五大国和平公约的问题等。
    维辛斯基接着指出：苏联为了尽速解决这些问题所做的努力，是从苏联外交政策的整个方针出发的，这个方针的基础，按照约·维·斯大林的英明定义来说，便是和平的思想，是为国际和平与友好、为加强和发展国际合作而奋斗。苏联外交政策的根据是：社会主义制度和资本主义制度的对立并不排除苏联与资本主义国家间进行合作与达成协议的可能性。从苏维埃国家成立的头几天起，从苏维埃政府的第一个法令“和平法令”起直到现在，苏联政府都是满怀信心地坚决依照发展和加强国际和睦友好关系的途径，依照在解决一切国际问题上与各国合作的途径办事的。列宁和斯大林曾一再强调指出苏维埃国家外交政策的和平目的。列宁曾一再指出：苏维埃国家的目的是和平的经济建设，和平建设“对我们来说，是最主要的事”。在一九二七年与第一次美国工人代表团的谈话中，约·维·斯大林在谈到苏联与资本主义国家在工业、贸易、外交方面达成协议的问题时，指出：“两个对立制度——资本主义制度和社会主义制度——的存在并不排除达成这种协议的可能性”。约·维·斯大林始终一贯地指出：如果有着互相合作的愿望、有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，而平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共处就是十分可能的。
    维辛斯基说，这就是苏联过去一贯执行的而且现在正在执行的苏维埃外交政策的总方针。
    在三月九日，约·维·斯大林的丧礼上，苏联政府的领导者——苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫、苏联部长会议第一副主席拉·巴·贝利亚和维·米·莫洛托夫发表讲话，谈到苏联政府目前的外交政策。他们都说，苏联外交政策的目标今后仍然是维护和巩固和平，为反对新战争准备而斗争，苏联的外交政策将仍然是与所有也愿意合作的国家在互惠的基础上进行国际合作的政策，这种政策是以列宁和斯大林关于资本主义和社会主义两种不同的制度有可能长期地和平共处和友好合作的学说为根据的。事实早已说明，如果把双方就马上停止朝鲜战争问题所已经取得协议的措施付诸实行，那对于和平事业和消除新战争威胁，都具有特别重大的意义。毫无疑问，朝鲜战争的发生增加了新的世界大战的威胁。同时，也毫无疑问，朝鲜战争一旦停止，这种威胁就一定能够减少，其他使国际关系趋于复杂并妨碍巩固和平和国际安全的许多至今未能解决的问题，也一定会因而比较易于解决。在重大的未决的问题当中，必须指出的是关于裁减军备和武装部队、关于禁止原子武器及为实行这项禁令而建立有效的国际管制的问题，这些问题的解决是需要加以特别注意的。裁减军备和武装部队、禁止原子武器和建立国际管制的问题，老早就是联合国大会面临的一项重大任务，老早就在等待着解决了。
    大家都知道，早在一九四六年十二月，联合国大会就通过一项决定，认为必须尽速裁减军备和武装部队，同时为了解决这个问题而采取的措施要不仅适用于次要武器，而且也适用于现代战争中的基本武器。大家也都知道，当时联合国大会还通过了一项决议，认为必须加速研究关于禁止原子武器、建立国际管制和监督的公约，以保证原子能只用于和平目的。在目前这个时候，我们愿特别强调这个决议中的一部分，在这部分里联合国大会号召联合国各会员国对安全理事会和原子能管制委员会给予一切帮助，以便利于建立和支持国际和平和集体安全，使世界人力和经济资源尽量少浪费在军备上面。无须强调大家都可以看出，要是把这一决议或者把这决议中的规定付诸实现，那该有多么重大的意义。然而，非常遗憾，这些规定至今还没有付诸实现，尽管一点也没有什么口实可以在任何程度上拖延这些重要问题的积极解决。
    安·扬·维辛斯基继续指出，采取加强军备和增加武装部队的措施，在外国领土上建立新的军事基地和扩大原有基地，拒绝禁止原子武器，扩大原子弹的生产以及同时进行相应的宣传——这一切事情都免不了要促成国际紧张关系的进一步恶化。这种种措施，毫无疑问破坏了各国间的信任，减少了消除新战争威胁的可能，削弱了各国接近和合作的可能性，因此也就妨碍了和平及国际安全的巩固。
    谈到组织军事联盟，毫无疑问，恰恰是这种措施破坏了国际信任，而不是促进国际关系的改善。这种措施促成了，而且也不能不促成，各国关系的恶化，这就孕育了国际的紧张和冲突。西方国家广大的舆论界也愈来愈认识到这一点。在他们的影响下，甚至像法国的“世界报”这一类报纸也往往发表言论，批评北大西洋集团的政策，说：“北大西洋集团国家的一切政策和策略都是为了进行冷战的，如果不是为了进行战争的话。”很明显，这样一种政策不可能促进各国和平关系的巩固。此外，还应该指出，北大西洋集团的策划者和主谋者硬说这个集团的任务是所谓防御的任务，但是，既然有联合国，那么组织这样一个集团是无论如何也没有道理的，因为联合国之所以成立，就是要团结各国人民的力量来维护和平和安全。维辛斯基进一步指出，在这一届大会上，苏联仍然像在以往历届大会上一样，坚决主张裁减军备和武装部队。波兰代表团在它的提案中向大会提议：为了防止新世界战争的威胁，建议“美利坚合众国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、英国、法国和中国政府这些安全理事会的常任理事国在一年期间内各把本国的武装部队，包括空军、海军和辅助部队，裁减三分之一，并提出关于本国军备的全部情报，同时并建议安全理事会在最短期间内召集国际会议，以裁减各国武装部队。”不久以前，苏联代表团就裁减军备和武装部队问题发言时，详细地分析了美国和英国代表批评苏联裁军建议的发言，并提醒委员会注意苏联建议的目的是真正裁减武装部队和军备。同时，苏联代表并指出了美国和英国代表在这个问题上所坚持的建议是没有道理的，这些建议不仅没有提到重要的禁止原子武器和细菌武器的问题，而且也完全没有提到任何裁减军备和武装部队的办法。苏联代表团认为，波兰代表团目前所提出的建议，即五大国在一年期间内各自把本国的武装部队，包括空军、海军和辅助部队，裁减三分之一的建议，是完全有效的。而美国、英国和法国代表反对这个建议，他们提出他们自己的建议，主张所谓报告和审查一切武装部队和军备的情报。
    但是，这种建议所提到的提供关于军备或武装部队的相应情报完全不能被认为是一种什么裁减军备和武装部队的措施，而且美国、英国、法国的代表打算以这样的次序来实现所谓报告和审查，这个次序把最重要和最秘密的武器和设置的报告和审查放到最迟的时间，甚至没有为此确定任何明确的时间。苏联过去和现在都不能同意这种所谓裁减军备和武装部队的计划，因为这个计划实际上和真正裁减军备和武装部队这样的任务毫无共同之处。波兰代表团的建议和苏联以前所提出的这类建议一样，都把裁减所谓一般军备和武装部队的问题和采取禁止原子武器的措施联系在一起。波兰提案主张立即通过决议，无条件禁止原子武器和其他大规模屠杀的武器，并建立严格的国际管制监督各国执行这项决议。这个问题也直到现在尚未能达成协议，因为在解决这个问题的计划、方式、方法方面存在着许多严重的分歧。大家知道，美国、英国及其他一些支持它们的国家的代表们把所谓艾奇逊——巴鲁克——李连塞尔计划作为他们关于解决原子问题的建议的基础，认为这个计划是最好的。在前几届会议上，我们已经详细地指出过这种看法是没有道理的，我们曾引证了许多事实作为根据，其中也包括
    一些权威的原子科学家们的意见，他们证实了巴鲁克计划中一些最大的缺点，这些缺点使得根本没有可能在这个计划的基础上达成任何协议。大家知道，曾经协助起草巴鲁克计划的洛克菲勒基金委员会主席伯纳德也认为这个计划在目前是不够的。这个计划的制订人之一李连塞尔不久以前说，这个计划现在不能采纳，甚至不能让它存在。去年，“国会记录”杂志上发表了一篇文章，题目是：“对原子能管制的最后要求”，文章指出，联合国原子能管制委员会早就离开了所谓大多数的计划，即所谓巴鲁克计划。但是，美国、英国、法国去年在巴黎坚持了这个计划，今年在纽约也坚持这个计划，虽然，原子专家们曾经警告：在目前的条件下，这个计划已经不适合了，已经过时了。
    美国自己的报纸也公开说，巴鲁克计划的基础是不正确的想像和错误，这种错误之所以发生，是由于原子科学的发展已超过了这个计划的制订人的想像的缘故。大家公开说，巴鲁克计划是过时了。因为这个计划是以美国在原子能方面的垄断为根据的，所以在美国失去了对原子能的垄断的同时，它也就失去了意义。这个计划的支持者虽然千方百计地设法挽救巴鲁克计划，但是他们没有能力证明这个计划以及以它为根据的解决原子问题的建议的丝毫优点，于是就企图说苏联提出的对这个问题的提案是不现实的。然而，这些说法的真正用意是要否决公正的、符合于人类良心和道义的要求的关于无条件立刻禁止原子武器的提案。大家知道，苏联主张联合国大会通过一项关于无条件禁止原子武器的决议。原子武器是一种进攻和侵略的武器。爱好和平的人民、一切反对侵略阴谋、反对侵略的人都不能承认它是可贵的。反对任何侵略计划和侵略阴谋的苏联坚决要求从军备中取缔原子弹，联合国大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器就可以产生这样的结果。
    波兰的提案还包括：号召所有没有参加或批准一九二五年六月十七日关于禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的国家参加或批准这一公约。这个问题已在政治委员会中经过讨论，因此就没有必要再谈论它的实质，也没有必要再来列举在朝鲜使用细菌武器、破坏一九二五年日内瓦议定书的事实，这些事实已由一些权威的国际委员会和许多证人以绝对客观的态度所证实，并且已在政治委员会中谈过。维辛
    斯基接着着重指出，因此，对参加或批准日内瓦议定书的号召是符合一切爱好和平的人民的根本利益
    的，是有助于和平和国际安全事业的。苏联竭力支持波兰代表团的这个提案。
    维辛斯基接着谈到朝鲜问题，他说：最近发生了重大事件。大家知道，朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀在给朝鲜联合国军总司令克拉克将军的复函中表示同意按照关于战俘待遇的一九四九年日内瓦公约第一百零九条交换重病重伤战俘。
    维辛斯基说，应当提醒，早在一九五○年七月十五日，即朝鲜战争爆发后的三星期，苏联政府领袖约·维·斯大林在给印度共和国总理潘迪特·贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁的复电中就已指出，要迅速解决朝鲜问题，最合理的办法是在安全理事会中听取朝鲜人民的意见。促进公正的停战和结束朝鲜战争的努力自此开始。一九五一年七月十日，根据苏联的创议，在开城开始了停战谈判，后来又在板门店继续进行，结果，除了交换战俘的问题外，一切问题几乎完全达成了协议。维辛斯基继称，周恩来三月三十日的声明和金日成三月三十一日的声明指出，他们已共同研究了联合国军总司令克拉克将军提出的关于交换双方病伤战俘的建议，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国政府并已对克拉克的信作了共同的回答。他们的声明指出，关于交换病伤战俘问题的合理解决，对于顺利解决全部战俘问题显然具有极重大的意义。解决全部战俘问题以保证停止朝鲜战争并缔结停战协定的时机，应当说是已经到来了。周恩来的声明郑重地指出：在朝鲜停战谈判中，只有一个战俘问题阻碍着朝鲜停战的实现，“如非朝鲜停战谈判中断五个多月之久，则这个战俘遣返问题可能早已找出解决的办法来了。”周恩来指出：“随着病伤战俘问题的合理解决，只要双方都真正具有互相让步以促成朝鲜停战的诚意，全部战俘问题的顺利解决，是完全应当的。”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成强调指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府希望迅速停止今后的流血，已准备采取措施，以争取能按照周恩来的声明中的各项建议达成朝鲜停战的协议。金日成首相说：这些建议是“不但为顺利解决交换病伤战俘的问题而且为顺利解决至今剩下的成为达成停战协定的唯一障碍的全部战俘的遣返问题的新的措施”。从周恩来和金日成的声明中可以看到，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提议：“双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府在全面解决全部战俘问题上的一致的立场就是这样。苏联支持中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在这个问题上的崇高的举动。苏联热烈支持关于恢复朝鲜谈判，以达成交换病伤战俘、和解决全部战俘问题的协议，并从而解决朝鲜停战和缔结停战协定问题的建议。我们已经指出过，板门店的长期谈判在战俘遣返问题上没有获得积极的结果，这个问题当然应当按照日内瓦公约的规定来解决，这是苏联政府以及中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所坚持的。大家知道，联合国大会上关于这个问题的屡次的讨论也没有产生积极的结果。周恩来外交部长和金日成首相声明说：双方在战俘问题上的分歧是目前达成朝鲜停战的唯一障碍。周恩来说道：“只由于终止朝鲜流血战争及和平解决朝鲜问题是关系到远东及世界人民的和平与安全问题，所以我们才采取这一新的步骤，准备将在对方恐吓和压迫下心存疑惧、不敢回家的我方被俘人员，提议在停战后转交中立国，并经过有关方面的解释，以保证他们的遣返问题能得到公正解决，而不致因此阻碍朝鲜停战的实现。”金日成首相也作了类似的声明。维·米·莫洛托夫今年四月一日就这个问题表示，苏联政府认为中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这一建议是完全公正的，并表示愿意尽力促其实现。维·米·莫洛托夫说：“毫无疑问，全世界的人民和真诚希望结束朝鲜战争和促进远东及全世界各国人民的和平与安全之巩固的人们，将以热烈的同情欢迎这个建议，并给它以充分的支持。”
    这个事实是不能不加注意的：如果朝鲜人民和中国人民在联合国中有自己的合法代表的话，那末联合国早就能够顺利地解决停战和结束朝鲜战争的问题了，因为没有他们的代表，联合国就失去了顺利地解决有关巩固和平及保障国际安全的重要问题的可能性。苏联政府认为自己有责任重新提醒：中国人民和朝鲜人民在联合国中的合法代表权问题是最重要的问题之一，对这个问题作肯定的决定是刻不容缓的。肯定地决定这个问题愈快，对巩固世界和平以及巩固联合国组织的国际威信就愈有益处。苏联代表团深信，中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的崇高的倡议会得到联合国全力的支持，陆、海、空军事行动会完全停止，因此战争将会结束，全世界爱好和平的人民所坚决要求并热烈希望的和平将在朝鲜恢复。
    维辛斯基继续指出：苏联代表团完全同意波兰代表团的提案，这个提案要大会建议在朝鲜作战的双方立即恢复停战谈判。维辛斯基表示相信双方在交换病伤战俘问题上和整个战俘问题上都会竭尽全力以达成协议，并会尽力消除阻挠结束朝鲜战争的障碍。他说，结束朝鲜战争和签订停战协定是消除新的世界大战的威胁和巩固和平及国际安全的措施中的最重要的环节之一。
    苏联代表团十分坚决地支持波兰代表团所提出的关于缔结五大国——苏联、美国、英国、中国、法国——和平公约的提案。成亿的人都表示了他们争取和平的坚决意志。联合国组织应该负起自己的责任，应该发出呼声，以便尽速缔结五大国——苏联、美国、英国、中国、法国——和平公约，全世界爱好和平的人民都公正地认为这个公约是世界的巩固的持久和平的保证。苏联始终不渝而坚定地执行着自己的政策，保卫着和平和国际合作的事业。全世界憎恨战争和渴望和平与幸福的亿万人民都关怀着这一伟大崇高事业的成功。
    近日来美国和英国的权威人士发表了一些有关外交形势的声明。艾森豪威尔总统、杜勒斯国务卿，英国外交大臣艾登最近发表了他们对目前国际形势的看法。他们特别注意所谓重整军备政策和它的一切后果。但是，可以预先说，这样的政策将不会带来好的结果，正像过去没有过好结果，而现在也没有好结果一样。至于苏联，正如苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫所说的，苏联主要关心的是“防止新战争，和一切国家和平相处”。苏联政府的领袖指出，“最正确、必要和公正的外交政策，就是以事实为根据，并为事实所证实了的、有效的、以互相信任为基础的国际和平的政策”。苏联不论过去、现在和将来都始终不变地遵循着自己的外交政策——国际和平的政策——的伟大原则，这一原则完全符合苏联人民和一切爱好和平的人民的根本利益。
