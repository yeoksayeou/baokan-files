The tragic incident of bad element Zhao Yingxian and landlord Zhao Ruxian, etc. of Wang Hanlin Village, Bin County, District One, Shandong Province, murdering Communist Party member Zhao Chengxian, has been investigated by the CPC Huimin Prefectural Committee and the Bin County Committee. After clarifying the case, the personnel involved in the case have been given disciplinary and legal punishments. The course of the "Zhao Chengxian Incident" is as follows:

Zhao Chengxian, a Communist Party member from Wang Hanlin Village, Yangji Township, District One, Bin County, was of poor peasant origin. He joined the local troops of our army in 1944. In the spring of 1946, he returned home due to injuries. Since then, he actively led the masses with Party member Zhao Guangcai and activists Zhao Yunhui and Zhang Fuchun (all poor peasants) in struggles such as anti-奸 (anti-traitors) and诉苦 (speaking bitterness), land reform, and review. Due to their hard work and firm stance, they were deeply trusted and supported by the people of the whole village.

Bad element Zhao Yingxian was the head of the Shengxian Taoist sect before liberation and the steward of landlord Zhao Lixun. After sneaking into the Party organization in 1944, he usurped the position of director of the village farmers' association and tried to make landlord Zhao Jiajun the village chief, second landlord Zhao Ruxian, who had been a puppet 保长 (head of a bao, a unit of ten households in the puppet regime), the instructor of the village militia self-defense team, and Zhao Xueliang, the nephew of a local tyrant and landlord, the leader of the militia self-defense team. At this time, the political power of Wang Hanlin Village was completely controlled by landlord elements.

During the anti-奸 and 诉苦 movement in the spring of 1946, the masses rose up to struggle against landlord Zhao Jiajun, etc., and removed Zhao Jiajun, Zhao Ruxian, and Zhao Xueliang from their positions. Zhao Chengxian was elected as the militia captain, Zhao Yunhui as the village chief, Zhang Fuchun as the director of the farmers' association, and Zhao Guangcai as the finance and grain committee member. The struggle against the landlords continued. When Zhao Yingxian learned that the masses were going to continue to struggle against local tyrant landlord Zhao Mingxian, he immediately told Zhao Mingxian to flee and instructed Zhao Mingxian's nephew, Zhao Xueliang, to defect to the Kuomintang reactionaries. Later, Zhao Mingxian returned home under the protection of Zhao Yingxian. When the masses wanted to struggle against Zhao Mingxian for the second time, Zhao Yingxian notified Zhao Mingxian to flee again. When the masses caught Zhao Mingxian again, Zhao Yingxian released him. When the masses caught Zhao Mingxian again, Zhao Mingxian committed suicide out of fear of punishment. Zhao Yingxian gathered all the landlords in the village, falsely claiming that Zhao Chengxian and others had forced a "good man" to death, and attempted to launch a riot, but was stopped by district cadres, and the conspiracy failed.

In 1947, Zhao Chengxian and others led the masses to carry out the review struggle. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army was attacking the liberated areas on the banks of the Yellow River in Shandong. Bad elements Zhao Yingxian and Zhao Chunlan took the opportunity to falsely accuse Zhao Chengxian, Zhao Yunhui, Zhang Fuchun, and Zhao Guangcai of "surrendering" to the Kuomintang reactionaries to Liang Shuxin (now the district chief of the district), the joint defense director of the township. Liang Shuxin arrested Zhao Chengxian and the other three without any investigation, beat them severely, and sent them to the county public security bureau for detention. In this way, Zhao Yingxian and others became even more arrogant, immediately sent Zhao Mingxian's nephew to be the militia captain, landlord Zhao Jianzhou to be the finance and grain committee member, and developed the female rogue Zhao Chunlan into a Communist Party member and made her the women's instructor. After these bad elements seized village political power, they completely returned the land and houses of local tyrant landlord Zhao Mingxian that had been confiscated by the masses, and arrested Zhao Chengxian and the other three's families, large and small, a total of eighteen people, and detained them in the landlord's home, where they were beaten and "interrogated" for more than twenty days. Zhao Chengxian's father was beaten unconscious several times, Zhao Guangcai's wife was stripped of her clothes and beaten until she was covered in blood, and their belongings were looted, even the chickens were taken and eaten. Finally, Zhao Yingxian asked them to be released on bail and stipulated four control measures: 1. They were not allowed to leave the village; 2. They were not allowed to file complaints; 3. They were not allowed to overturn the case; 4. Anyone who violated the above regulations would be killed without question. They were also fined to wear "red and white cloth shirts" and work for bad elements and landlord henchmen Zhao Yingxian and Zhao Chunlan for three months.

After Zhao Chengxian and others were escorted to the public security bureau, they were subjected to torture and forced confessions all day long, and Zhao Chengxian was beaten to death in prison. When the body was being transported home, Zhao Yingxian, Zhao Ruxian, and others arrogantly refused to allow it to enter the village, change clothes, allow the family to cry, or bury it in a coffin. They forced Zhao Chengxian's body to be buried naked in the soil. The other three were tortured in the county public security bureau for more than twenty days and never confessed. At this time, the county committee sent Li Qiushan to the village to investigate. When Li Qiushan learned that this was a landlord's conspiracy, he reported it to the county and district leaders. However, after receiving this report, the county and district leaders were still numb and skeptical and asked Zhao Yingxian to guarantee the return of Zhao Yunhui and the other two, handing them over to the "masses for disposal." On the way home, landlord element Zhao Xueshun attempted to beat Zhao Yunhui and others to death, but was stopped by militia member Zhao Xiqing. After returning to the village, Zhao Yingxian and others privately detained Zhao Yunhui and others for more than twenty days, determined to beat them to death. Peasants Zhao Wenhe and Zhao Dexian said, "They were wronged," and were imprisoned for seven days and almost strangled to death. After that, Zhao Yingxian placed Zhao Yunhui and others under control and forced them to do hard labor for bad elements for half a year. In 1948, Zhao Yingxian went to the county for training and dropped his Party membership when he returned to the village. In order to maintain the interests of the landlord group, Zhao Yingxian tried every means to win over branch secretary Zhao Peizhang and landlord Zhao Jianzhou to do business together. Female rogue Zhao Chunlan had an affair with Zhao Peizhang, and Zhao Yingxian even instructed his wife to have an affair with Zhao Peizhang. From then on, branch secretary Zhao Peizhang colluded with them, raping women, running rampant, and committing all kinds of evil. Former township branch secretary Yu Zhen and district public security officer Liang Shuxin (formerly the joint defense director) actually regarded these bad elements as "good people" and gave them support in many ways, so Zhao Yingxian and others were able to do whatever they wanted in Wang Hanlin Village. At that time, when county and district staff came to the village to work, Zhao Yingxian and others threatened the masses on the one hand, saying, "Don't talk too much, you will be responsible for what happens;" on the other hand, they used despicable means to buy off the staff. The county and district never conducted thorough investigations, and when the tasks assigned were not completed, they subjectively believed that the masses of Wang Hanlin Village were "backward," saying that "Wang Hanlin Village is a backward village."

At the end of the land reform in 1950, the landlord elements bought off land reform team member Yan Wenran: female rogue Zhao Chunlan had an affair with Yan Wenran, and landlords Zhao Jianzhou and Zhao Xueshun bribed Yan Wenran 300,000 yuan. As a result, the work to conclude the land reform in this village only dealt with these two things: first, Zhao Jianzhou and other four landlord households were classified as "middle peasants;" second, they supported landlord Zhao Jianzhou in taking back a house that had been distributed to poor peasants, and landlord Zhao Xueshun took back his residence, covering up Zhao Mingxian's sale of five mu of land. Therefore, the masses reflected: "Concluding the land reform was doing good deeds for the landlords."

In the autumn of 1952, when the Party rectification work team came to this village to carry out Party rectification, although they initially clarified the problem, expelled bad element Zhao Chunlan from the Party, and removed Zhao Yingxian from his position as director of the farmers' association, they did not deeply mobilize the masses and resolutely punish bad elements. They still "elected" the degenerate element Zhao Peizhang as the deputy secretary of the village branch, allowed Zhao Yingxian to participate in Party rectification as a representative of the masses, and Zhao Chunlan was still a representative of the township people's congress. For several years, the masses of Wang Hanlin Village have been ridden on the heads by landlords and bad elements. The village presents a desolate scene. No one dares to stand on the street during the day, and people close their doors early at dusk. The Party rectification work team did not help the masses to remove these big stones. The masses secretly discussed: "How come these cadres are all taking the path of Qin Shihuang's grandmother."

"Chairman Mao, please send someone here quickly to defeat Zhao Yingxian and lead us to turn over and stand up."

In January of this year, in order to thoroughly find out the reasons for the depressed mood of the masses in Wang Hanlin Village, the Huimin Prefectural Committee and the Bin County Committee, after an in-depth investigation by the work team, instructed the Bin County Committee to expel Zhao Peizhang, a lawless and undisciplined element, from the Party, and to arrest and prosecute bad element Zhao Yingxian and landlord Zhao Ruxian by the county people's government; to revoke the qualifications of bad element Zhao Chunlan as a representative of the township people's congress and place her under control; to recover the property that the landlords had restored and occupied from the peasants; to posthumously recognize Zhao Chengxian as a martyr; and to give Party disciplinary and administrative punishments to the staff members responsible for the case according to the severity of their responsibility.

The "Zhao Chengxian Incident" in Wang Hanlin Village shows that the backwardness of Wang Hanlin Village was caused by landlord elements usurping the leadership and sneaking into the Party organization, cruelly ruling and exploiting the masses. The reason why landlord elements were able to hide in our rural organizations for a long time, even after experiencing land reform review work, and movements such as ending land reform and Party rectification, was that they were not discovered. This is inseparable from the serious political numbness and bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of Bin County and Bin County District. This incident shows that the bureaucrats cannot distinguish right from wrong, listen to only one side of the story, and actually attribute the reason for the depressed mood of this village to the "backwardness" of the masses. This is very wrong. It also shows:

First, to open up the situation in backward villages ruled by destructive elements, we must deeply mobilize the masses through the current work. Resolutely and quickly dealing with bad elements with obvious misdeeds and bad elements who have usurped leadership will greatly encourage the masses to reveal the courage of bad people and bad deeds and thoroughly clarify complicated cases. When the work team discovered the depressed mood of the masses in Wang Hanlin Village, most of the masses did not attend the meeting, and even if they did, they did not speak. After discovering the branch secretary Zhao Peizhang's resistance to the leadership and failure to perform tasks, they felt that there was a problem and immediately went to individual households to start with current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea, and also carried out democratic education on the people being masters of their own affairs. After being educated, some of the masses raised their awareness and began to reflect the facts of branch secretary Zhao Peizhang's violation of laws and disciplines and sheltering landlords. After multi-faceted investigation, it was proved that the various materials submitted by the masses were true. The county and district Party committees quickly decided to expel bad element Zhao Peizhang from the Party, the government revoked his concurrent posts, and publicly announced it to the masses. Therefore, the concerns of the masses were quickly eliminated. Believing that the work team could solve the problem, they successively accused the work team of the evil deeds of bad element Zhao Yingxian and landlord Zhao Ruxian. At the accusation meeting, more than 30 people cried until their eyes were red. The work team immediately grasped the urgent demands of the masses, and at the township people's congress to deploy winter work, further exposed the evil deeds of Zhao Yingxian and Zhao Ruxian. After full discussion by the People's Congress and approval by the County People's Government, Zhao Yingxian, Zhao Ruxian, and others were arrested and punished according to law. As a result, the public was excited and said, "A thunderclap cleared the sky." "Now I can spit out the bitter water and see Chairman Mao." Zhao Yunhui said, "In the past, the landlords oppressed me and made me bend over, but today I stand up straight." The families of Zhao Chengxian, Zhao Guangcai, and Zhang Fuchun were moved to tears and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Government!" Facts have proved that timely, resolute, serious, and conscientious handling of bad people and bad things will inevitably be warmly supported by the broad masses of the people and will greatly close the ties between the Party and the government and the people.

Second, it is completely correct to closely integrate the current central work, deal with bad people and bad things, and promote the current work through the handling of bad people and bad things. Because of the serious handling of the "Zhao Chengxian Incident" in Wang Hanlin Village and the punishment of landlords and bad elements, the political enthusiasm and sense of ownership of the masses have been greatly inspired. Therefore, the winter work in Wang Hanlin Village has made great progress. The peasants in the whole village have checked and revised the patriotic pact; 79 percent of the households have participated in agricultural mutual aid groups and have all signed patriotic production increase plans. At the same time, the Party branch, militia, and mass organizations in the village have been reorganized, and the model figures who have actively worked in the movement, closely contacted the masses, and completed the work tasks by following the mass line have been selected for leadership positions. The village has changed from a previously depressed state to an active village. During the Spring Festival, the masses compiled the story of the village's liberation into allegro songs and sang them everywhere.

Third, through the handling of this case, the serious bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres and the loss of position of some cadres were deeply exposed. Due to the serious bureaucratism in the Party and government leadership of Bin County, the good people Zhao Chengxian and the other three were wrongly arrested, resulting in the tragic incident of Zhao Chengxian being tortured to death. They made painful self-criticisms for this bureaucratic style of ignoring the suffering of the masses and listening only to one side of the story at the county, district, and township cadre conferences, the Yangji Township People's Congress, and the Wang Hanlin Village Villagers' Congress. The former district public security officer Liang Shuxin (now the district chief) and the former township branch secretary Yu Zhen all made self-criticisms to the masses for their serious mistakes of losing their position and supporting and condoning bad elements in doing evil, apologizing to the victimized families one by one, and accepting the criticism of village cadres, village representatives, and the masses. The handling of this case was a very profound education for cadres and the masses throughout the county. Some cadres said: "In the future, we must stand firm, not be deceived by bad elements, go deep into the masses, and no longer commit bureaucratism."

    中共惠民地委严正处理“赵承先事件”
    山东滨县一区王翰林村坏分子赵英贤、地主赵汝贤等害死共产党员赵承先的惨痛事件，经中共惠民地委与滨县县委的调查，在案情弄清以后，对有关此案的人员，已分别予以党纪和国法的处分。“赵承先事件”的经过是这样的：
    滨县一区杨集乡王翰林村共产党员赵承先，贫农成份，于一九四四年参加我军地方部队，一九四六年春因负伤回家，此后即与党员赵光彩、积极分子赵云会、张福春（均系贫农）一起积极地领导群众进行反奸诉苦、土地改革、复查等斗争。由于他们的工作努力，立场坚定，因此深得全村人民的信任和支持。
    坏分子赵英贤，解放前是圣贤道首，地主赵立训的管家，一九四四年混入党的组织后，篡夺了村农会主任的职务，并设法使地主赵家俊当了村长、当过伪保长的二地主赵汝贤当了村民兵自卫团指导员、恶霸地主的侄子赵学良当了民兵自卫团长。这时王翰林村的政权完全为地主分子所掌握。
    一九四六年春的反奸诉苦运动中，群众起来斗争了地主赵家俊等；并将赵家俊、赵汝贤、赵学良三人的职务一律撤销，选举了赵承先任民兵队长、赵云会任村长、张福春任农会主任、赵光彩任财粮委员，并继续对地主进行斗争。当赵英贤得知群众要继续斗争恶霸地主赵明贤的消息后，即叫赵明贤逃跑，并指使赵明贤的侄子赵学良投奔国民党反动派。后来赵明贤在赵英贤的庇护下回了家，当群众二次要斗争赵明贤时，赵英贤又通知赵明贤逃跑。当群众把赵明贤抓回来后，赵英贤又把他放走。当群众再次把赵明贤抓回来，赵明贤畏罪自杀时，赵英贤竟纠集了全村的地主，诬称赵承先等逼死了“好人”，并图谋趁机暴乱，幸被区干部制止，阴谋未逞。
    一九四七年赵承先等又领导群众进行复查斗争，此时正值蒋匪军进攻到了山东黄河边解放区，坏分子赵英贤、赵春兰便趁机到乡联防主任梁树信（现任该区区长）处诬告赵承先、赵云会、张福春、赵光彩等要“投降”国民党反动派，梁树信未作任何调查，即通知县独立营将赵承先等四人逮捕，并痛打一顿，送县公安局关押。这样，赵英贤等更加嚣张，立即派地主赵明贤的侄子任民兵队长、地主赵建周任财粮委员、将女流氓赵春兰发展为共产党员，当妇女指导员，地主的狗腿子蒋贤任村长。这些坏分子掌握村政权后，即将已被群众没收的恶霸地主赵明贤的土地房屋完全倒回，将赵承先等四人的家属大、小十八人一起逮捕起来，扣押在地主家中，毒打“审讯”二十余天。把赵承先的父亲打的昏死过去几次，把赵光彩的女人剥了衣服打的混身出血；把他们家中的东西抢的净光，连鸡都抢去吃了。最后赵英贤叫他们取保回家，并给他们规定了四项管制办法：一、不准出庄；二、不准告状；三、不准翻案；四、谁违犯了以上规定打死勿论。并罚他们穿上“红、白布衫”，给坏分子及地主爪牙赵英贤、赵春兰做活三个月之久。
    赵承先等被押送到公安局以后，整日受酷刑逼供，赵承先竟被打死在狱中。当尸体往家运的时候，赵英贤、赵汝贤等狂妄地不准进庄，不准换衣服，不准家属哭，不准用棺材埋葬；逼着把赵承先的尸体赤身露体地埋入土中。其他三人在县公安局被刑讯二十余天，一直没有口供。这时县委会才派李秋山去该村调查，当李秋山了解到这是地主的阴谋后，即向县、区领导干部作了报告。但县、区领导干部接到这个报告后，仍然麻木不仁，半信半疑，并叫赵英贤将赵云会等三人保回去，交“群众处理”。在回家的路上，地主分子赵学顺企图将赵云会等打死，幸被民兵赵希庆保护制止。回村后赵英贤等又私自将赵云会等押了二十多天，一心想打死他们。农民赵文和、赵德贤说了一声“屈了人家”，就被禁闭了七天，还几乎被勒死。此后赵英贤将赵云会等管制起来，并强迫给坏分子做苦工半年之久。一九四八年，赵英贤到县里去受训，回村时扔掉了党的关系。赵英贤为了维护地主集团的利益，就想尽一切办法拉拢支部书记赵培章和地主赵建周合伙做生意。女流氓赵春兰和赵培章通奸，赵英贤还指使自己的老婆和赵培章通奸。从此支部书记赵培章就和他们同流合污，强奸妇女，横行霸道，无恶不作。前任乡支部书记于震和区公安员梁树信（原任联防主任）竟把这些坏分子当做“好人”，多方予以支持，因而赵英贤等得以肆无忌惮地在王翰林村任所欲为。当时县、区工作人员来村工作时，赵英贤等一方面威胁群众说：“不许多说话，出了事由你们负责；”一方面以卑鄙的手段来收买工作人员；县、区一向未作切实的调查，交下去的工作任务完不成时，即主观地认为王翰林村群众“落后”“王翰林村是个落后村”。
    一九五○年结束土地改革时，地主分子又收买了土地改革工作队员阎文然：女流氓赵春兰和阎文然通奸，地主赵建周、赵学顺贿赂阎文然三十万元。结果这个村的土地改革结束工作只办了这两件事：第一件把赵建周等四户地主划成了“中农”；第二件支持地主赵建周倒回贫农分得的一所房子，地主赵学顺将住宅要回，包庇赵明贤卖了五亩地。所以群众反映：“结束土地改革是给地主办了好事。”
    一九五二年秋天，整党工作队来这个村进行整党工作时，虽然初步弄清了问题，开除了坏分子赵春兰的党籍，撤销了赵英贤农会主任职务，但并未深入发动群众，坚决惩办坏分子，仍然把蜕化变质分子赵培章“选”为村支部副书记，让赵英贤以群众代表的身分参加整党，赵春兰仍然是乡人民代表会的代表。几年来王翰林村的群众，一直被地主、坏分子骑在头上，村内呈现着一片凄凉景象，白天无人敢在街头站立，黄昏早早关门闭户。整党工作队却不去帮助群众搬掉这些大石头。群众暗地议论说：“怎么来的这些干部都是走秦始皇他老奶奶的道。”
    “毛主席，你赶快派人来吧，好整倒赵英贤，领导俺们翻翻身。”
    今年一月间，惠民地委与滨县县委为了彻底弄清王翰林村群众情绪消沉的原因，经工作组深入调查弄清事实后，惠民地委即指示滨县县委，将违法乱纪分子赵培章开除出党，坏分子赵英贤与地主赵汝贤由县人民政府逮捕法办；撤销坏分子赵春兰乡人民代表资格，并予以管制；将地主复辟倒算和霸占农民的财产追回；追认赵承先为烈士；对该案负有责任的工作人员，依据责任大小，分别予以党纪和行政处分。
    王翰林村“赵承先事件”，说明了王翰林村所以落后，是由于地主分子篡夺了领导权，并混进了党的组织，残酷地统治压榨群众所造成的。地主分子之所以能够长期隐藏在我乡村组织中，虽经历过土地改革复查工作，及结束土地改革、整党等运动，均未被发现，这是同滨县及滨县区领导干部在政治上严重的麻木不仁和官僚主义作风分不开的。这一事件说明了官僚主义者辨不清是非，偏听偏信，竟将这种村庄情绪消沉的原因，归结到群众“落后”方面去，这是十分错误的。同样也说明了：
    第一、要打开破坏分子统治的落后村的局面，必须通过当前工作深入地发动群众。对于劣迹昭彰的坏分子和篡夺领导权的坏分子，坚决迅速地予以处理，就会大大地鼓舞群众揭发坏人坏事的勇气，彻底弄清复杂的案情。当工作组在王翰林村发现群众情绪消沉，开会时多数群众不到，即是到会也不发言，支部书记赵培章对抗领导不执行任务等情况后，就感到其中有问题，立即分头深入农户，从抗美援朝的时事教育着手，又进行了人民当家作主人的民主教育。一部分群众经过教育后提高了觉悟，开始反映了支部书记赵培章违法乱纪、包庇地主的事实。经过多方面的考察，证明群众所提各项材料属实，县、区党委迅即决定开除坏分子赵培章党籍，由政府撤销其所兼职务，并公开向群众宣布。因此，群众的顾虑就很快地消除了，相信工作组能够解决问题，随即纷纷地向工作组控诉坏分子赵英贤、地主赵汝贤的罪恶事实。在控诉会上有三十多人哭红了眼睛。工作组即紧紧掌握了群众这一迫切要求，在布置冬季工作的乡人民代表会上，进一步揭发了赵英贤、赵汝贤的罪恶，经过人民代表会的充分讨论，又经县人民政府批准，将赵英贤、赵汝贤等逮捕法办。于是群情振奋，纷纷说道：“一声雷响晴了天。”“如今我可吐出了苦水，看见毛主席了。”赵云会说：“我过去给地主压的弯了腰，今天直起来了。”赵承先、赵光彩、张福春的家属被感动得落下泪来，并高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“人民政府万岁！”事实证明：及时坚决、严肃、认真地处理坏人坏事，必然会得到广大人民群众的热诚拥护，必然会大大地密切党与政府和人民群众的联系。
    第二、紧紧结合当前中心工作，处理坏人坏事，又通过对坏人坏事的处理来推动当前的工作，这样的作法是完全正确的。由于严肃地处理了王翰林村“赵承先事件”，惩办了地主、坏分子，也就大大的启发了群众的政治热情和主人翁的感觉，所以王翰林村的冬季工作有了很大的进展。全村农民都检查修订了爱国公约；有百分之七十九的农户参加了农业互助组，并且都订了爱国增产计划。同时还整理了村上的党支部、民兵及群众团体等组织；将运动中积极工作、密切联系群众、走群众路线完成工作任务的模范人物，选拔到领导岗位上来。该村从过去一向消沉的状态中一变而为活跃的村庄了。春节期间，群众把本村翻身的故事编成快板到处演唱。
    第三、通过这一案件的处理，深刻地揭发了领导干部中严重的官僚主义作风和某些干部丧失立场的行为。由于滨县党政领导上存在着严重的官僚主义，错误地逮捕好人赵承先等四人，致造成赵承先被刑讯打死的惨痛事件。他们对这种漠视群众疾苦，偏听偏信的官僚主义，在县、区、乡干部大会、杨集乡人民代表会上、王翰林村村民大会上，都作了沉痛的检讨。原区公安员梁树信（现任区长），原乡支部书记于震，都向群众检讨了自己丧失立场、支持纵容坏分子为非作歹的严重错误，逐户向被陷害的家属赔情道歉，并接受村干部、村代表和群众的批评。这一案件的处理，对全县干部及群众都是一次极深刻的教育。有的干部说：“今后一定要站稳立场，不受坏分子的蒙蔽，要深入联系群众，不再犯官僚主义。”
