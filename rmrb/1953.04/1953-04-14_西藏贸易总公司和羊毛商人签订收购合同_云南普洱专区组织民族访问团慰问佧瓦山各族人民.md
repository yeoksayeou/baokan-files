Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 9th—The state-owned Tibet Trade Corporation signed a contract with Tibetan wool merchants in Lhasa on April 2nd to purchase wool produced in Tibet in 1952 at a reasonable price.

General Tan Guansan, Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhang Ying, head of the Lhasa Office of the People's Bank of China, and Tibetan local government officials Kalon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme and Soikang Wangchenpa attended the contract signing ceremony.

After the contract was signed, General Tan Guansan spoke, calling on people in Tibetan industrial and commercial circles to unite more closely around the state-owned Tibet Trade Corporation and strive to open up sales channels for Tibetan native and special products. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme spoke on behalf of the Tibetan local government. He said: The signing of the wool purchase contract is a concrete manifestation of the gradual development of Tibetan agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce in accordance with the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet reached by the Central People's Government, and it is a great joy for all the Tibetan people. It is hoped that merchants will further develop Tibetan industry and commerce and improve the people's lives under the leadership of the state-owned Tibet Trade Corporation in the future. Bangsu Cilang, the representative of the wool merchants, expressed his sincere gratitude to the Central People's Government for its care in his speech. He said: These concrete assistance from the Central People's Government makes us feel the warmth of the motherland's big family even more. We will definitely guarantee the execution of the contract, deliver the goods on time, and improve the quality and specifications of wool products.

According to Xinhua News Agency: This spring, the Pu'er Special District of Yunnan Province dispatched an "Ethnic Visiting Group" to the remote mountainous area bordering Burma—the Ximeng area of Kawa Mountain—to comfort people of all ethnic groups. The visiting group carried more than 50,000 jin of edible salt and a large quantity of homespun cloth, foreign cloth, needles, thread, and clothing, which were distributed to people of all ethnic minorities in more than 200 villages in the mountainous area. The medical staff accompanying the visiting group also treated more than 3,500 people for diseases and vaccinated more than 3,700 Kawa and Lahu people against smallpox.

The visiting group held a chieftain meeting in Ximeng City, Kawa Mountain. A total of 126 ethnic leaders in the district, including princes and chieftains, attended the meeting. Zhao Wei, head of the visiting group, conveyed in detail Chairman Mao's care for the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas, explained the ethnic policies, called on all ethnic groups to unite, and stated that the People's Government would definitely help the people of all ethnic minorities improve their lives and supply Kawa Mountain with the most needed edible salt, cloth, and farm tools. After the chieftains of all ethnic groups realized the principle that unity among all ethnic groups is the only way to defend the border areas, they all excitedly said: In the past, the Kuomintang provoked us to fight each other and cause disunity; after the Communist Party came, they told us these principles, and we are now one family. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words carefully. Representatives of Awana Village and Mo'a Village, who used to be disunited, even drank "soaked wine" (indicating unity) together. On the same evening, a unity party was also held on Kawa Mountain.

The Ximeng area of Kawa Mountain is inhabited by more than 200,000 people of Kawa, Lahu, Han, and other ethnic groups. The soil here is barren, and grain production is extremely low. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries often looted the grain and cattle of the people in the mountainous areas, making the lives of the people of all ethnic groups very painful. This time, the Pu'er Special District Ethnic Visiting Group went deep into the mountainous areas to offer comfort and distributed a large amount of edible salt and cloth, for which the people of all ethnic groups deeply thanked the care of the People's Government.

    云南普洱专区组织民族访问团慰问佧瓦山各族人民
    【新华社拉萨九日电】国营西藏贸易总公司于四月二日在拉萨和西藏羊毛商人签订合同，以合理价格收购西藏地区一九五二年出产的羊毛。
    中国人民解放军西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军，中国人民银行拉萨办事处负责人张英和西藏地方政府噶伦阿沛·阿旺晋美、索康·汪钦巴等官员都参加了签订合同仪式。
    合同签字后，谭冠三将军讲话，他号召西藏工商界人士更加亲密地团结在国营西藏贸易总公司的周围，为打开西藏土、特产品的销路而努力。阿沛·阿旺晋美代表西藏地方政府讲话。他说：收购羊毛合同的签订，是中央人民政府执行和平解放西藏办法的协议上逐步发展西藏农牧工商业的具体事实，是全藏人民的大喜事，希望商人们今后在国营西藏贸易总公司的领导下，进一步发展西藏的工商业，改善人民生活。羊毛商代表邦苏慈朗在讲话中对中央人民政府的关怀表示万分感激。他说：从中央人民政府这些具体的帮助中，使我们更加体会到祖国大家庭的温暖，我们一定保证执行合同，按期交货，改良和提高羊毛产品的品质、规格。
    据新华社讯：云南省普洱专区今年春天派遣“民族访问团”深入与缅甸接邻的边远山区——佧瓦山西盟地区，慰问各族人民。访问团携带了五万多斤食盐及大批的土布、洋布、针、线、衣服，分送给山区二百多个村寨的各少数民族人民。随访问团前往的医务人员，还给三千五百多人诊治疾病，给三千七百多个佧瓦、倮?族人民种了牛痘。
    访问团在佧瓦山的西盟城召开了一次头人会议，该区各民族领袖人物包括王子、头人等共一百二十六人出席了会议。访问团团长赵伟在会上详细传达了毛主席对边疆各族人民的关怀，讲解了民族政策，号召各民族团结起来，并表示人民政府一定帮助各少数民族人民改善生活，供应佧瓦山最缺少的食盐、布匹及农具等。各族头人认识了各民族团结才能保卫边疆的道理后都兴奋地说：过去国民党挑拨我们，你打我杀的闹不团结；共产党来了，告诉我们这些道理，我们是一家人了，我们要好好听毛主席的话。过去不团结的阿娃那寨和磨阿寨的代表还在一起吃了“泡酒”（表示团结）。当天晚上，佧瓦山上还举行了团结晚会。
    佧瓦山西盟地区住居着佧瓦、倮?、汉族等二十多万人。这里土质瘠薄，粮食产量极少，过去国民党反动派经常抢掠山区人民的粮食和耕牛，使各民族人民生活非常痛苦。这次普洱专区民族访问团深入山区慰问，并分送了大批食盐和布匹，各族人民深深感谢人民政府的关怀。
