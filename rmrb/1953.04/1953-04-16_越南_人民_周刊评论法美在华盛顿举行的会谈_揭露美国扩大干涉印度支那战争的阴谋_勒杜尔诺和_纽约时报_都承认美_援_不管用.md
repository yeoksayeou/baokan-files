Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "People" Weekly recently published an article entitled "The Franco-American Talks in Washington," exposing the US imperialists' plot to expand intervention in the Indochina War and the contradictions between the US and France. The article points out: The reactionary French government placed great hope on US aid, hoping to use it to salvage their predicament in Indochina and resolve France's financial crisis. Although French Prime Minister Mayer said: "We did not come to the United States to beg for anything." But American newspapers bluntly pointed out that this Frenchman came to beg for American aid.

The article retraces the concessions the French reactionaries were forced to make at the Washington talks, and then says: The Washington talks exposed the sharp contradictions between the French and American imperialists, and the contradiction in Indochina is one of them. France hopes that the United States will increase aid to Indochina, but it is unwilling for the United States to give aid directly to the puppets; while the United States attempts to seize direct control of the puppet government and the puppet army through aid. They also hope to seize direct command of the Indochina War.

The article says: At the Washington conference, France was blackmailed by the United States, but the United States will continue to provide more assistance to the French army in Indochina, attempting to realize Leduno's plan to conquer Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos within two years.

The article, after pointing out that the US and French aggressors cannot realize their arrogant "plan," said: The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos are redoubling their vigilance against the US and French imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against these three countries. The Vietnamese people will unite with the people of Cambodia and Laos to give the US-French aggressors and puppet traitors greater blows.

Xinhua News Agency: Leduno, the French Minister of Relations with the Member States of the Federation who remained in Washington after the Franco-American talks to beg the US government for aid, left the US and returned to France on the 4th.

According to Leduno himself: he was invited to stay by the heads of the State Department and the Pentagon to study the "entire problem caused by" the establishment of 54 lightly armed battalions of the Bao Dai puppet army, including the arming and maintenance of these puppet troops.

According to United Press International, as a result of Leduno's talks with the United States, the US Department of Defense was "very enthusiastic" about the establishment of lightly armed battalions of the Bao Dai puppet army. However, United Press International admitted that the United States "cannot quickly supply everything Vietnam needs because of the great needs of the Korean War." Therefore, the United States is acquiring C-47 transport aircraft from American private airlines, equipping them, and transporting them to the French army invading Vietnam.

During his visit to the United States, Leduno proposed a plan for France to "win" the Indochina War within two years as a condition for the United States to agree to increase aid to Indochina. The main content of this plan is to implement the US aggressive policy of "using Asians to fight Asians," and to step up the expansion of the Bao Dai puppet army so that the puppet army can gradually replace the French army in assuming the main responsibility for combat. But even Leduno himself does not believe that this so-called "winning the war" plan can be realized. This French minister, who has tasted the iron fist of the Vietnamese People's Army in Vietnam, said with frustration when leaving the United States: He is "always afraid that he will not be able to complete it on time." "The New York Times," the mouthpiece of US monopoly capital, also admitted that US aid is useless. It said: "No matter how cooperative the Franco-American conference is, it is impossible to immediately solve the fate of Indochina."

    越南“人民”周刊评论法美在华盛顿举行的会谈揭露美国扩大干涉印度支那战争的阴谋
    勒杜尔诺和“纽约时报”都承认美“援”不管用
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民”周刊最近刊载题为“华盛顿的美法会谈”的文章，揭露美帝国主义扩大干涉印度支那战争的阴谋和美、法间的矛盾。文章指出：法国反动政府曾对美国的援助寄以很大的希望，想借此挽救他们在印度支那的困境和解救法国的财政危机。虽然法国总理迈耶说过：“我们到美国来并不是为了乞求什么”。但是美国报纸直率地指出，这个法国人就是来乞求美国援助的。
    文章追述法国反动派被迫在华盛顿会谈上所作的让步，接着说：华盛顿的会谈暴露出法、美帝国主义者之间的尖锐矛盾，印度支那的矛盾就是其中之一。法国希望美国增加对印度支那的援助，但是它不愿意美国把援助直接给予傀儡；而美国却企图通过援助来夺取对傀儡政府和傀儡军队的直接控制权。它们还希望能夺取对印度支那战争的直接指挥权。
    文章说：在华盛顿的会议上，法国被美国敲诈了，但是美国将继续给予印度支那的法国军队以更多的援助，企图实现勒杜尔诺提出的在两年内征服越南、高棉和寮国的计划。
    文章在指出美、法侵略者无法实现它们的这个狂妄的“计划”后说：越南、高棉和寮国的人民正在加倍警惕美、法帝国主义者企图扩大对这三个国家的侵略战争的阴谋。越南人民将和高棉、寮国人民团结一致，给美法侵略者和傀儡卖国贼们以更大的打击。
    【新华社讯】在法美会谈结束后留在华盛顿向美国政府乞求援助的法国联邦成员国关系部部长勒杜尔诺，已在四日离美返法。
    据勒杜尔诺自己透露：他是应国务院和五角大楼首脑的邀请而留下来，以便和后者研究由于建立保大伪军五十四个轻装营“而引起的整个问题”，其中包括武装和维持这些伪军的问题。
    勒杜尔诺和美国商谈结果，据合众社消息说，美国国防部对成立保大伪军的轻装营“非常热心”。但是，合众社的消息承认美国“由于朝鲜战争需要太大，不能很快供给越南所需要的一切”，因此，美国正在收购美国私营航空公司的C四十七型运输机，加以装备后运交侵越法军使用。
    勒杜尔诺在访问美国时曾提出法国在二年内“赢得”印度支那战争的计划，作为美国同意增加对印度支那援助的条件。这个计划的主要内容是实行美国的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的侵略政策，加紧扩充保大伪军，使伪军能够逐渐代替法军担负作战的主要责任。但是对这个所谓“赢得战争”的计划，连勒杜尔诺自己也不相信它能够实现，这个在越南饱尝越南人民军铁拳滋味的法国部长在离开美国的时候满怀沮丧地说：他“始终害怕不能按期完成”。美国独占资本的喉舌“纽约时报”也承认美国的援助不管用，它说：“不管法美两国多么合作的会议，也不可能立即解决印度支那的命运问题。”
