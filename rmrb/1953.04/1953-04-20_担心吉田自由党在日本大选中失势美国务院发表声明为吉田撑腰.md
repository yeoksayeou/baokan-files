Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Fearing that the Yoshida Liberal Party, a tool of American rule in Japan, would lose ground in the Japanese general election, the US government has publicly come forward to support the Yoshida Liberal Party on the eve of the election.

A US State Department spokesman said in Washington on the 15th: "The State Department believes that the total amount of US spending in Japan will not be greatly reduced, and will maintain a fairly high level for at least the next two years." Kyodo News Agency Tokyo, April 16th, reported: The purpose of this statement is: "to provide political cover for the pro-American Yoshida Cabinet in the elections of both houses of parliament" and to prevent Japan from "falling into economic chaos." The Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Yoshida Cabinet, Kenji Fukunaga, also admitted when meeting with reporters on the 16th that the State Department's statement was "aimed at eliminating the unease of Japanese business and economic circles." News from Washington further confirmed this intention of the State Department's statement. Kyodo News Agency's Washington correspondent reported on the 15th: "Since the negotiations for the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war have progressed rapidly, Japan has felt very uneasy about the prospects of Korean special procurements," "The purpose of the United States in issuing this statement is to eliminate this uneasiness," because Washington believes that "this statement will affect the election in Japan a few days later...."

In order to ease the dissatisfaction of Japanese economic circles with the ruling Yoshida Liberal Party, the United States also granted the Yoshida government a $40 million cotton loan during the election period. News from Tokyo said: Japan's "opposition parties see from these actions that the United States is supporting the pro-American Yoshida regime. They say that the Yoshida government has been maintained with the support of the United States for the past six years."

    担心吉田自由党在日本大选中失势美国务院发表声明为吉田撑腰
    【新华社十九日讯】由于担心美国统治日本的工具——吉田自由党在日本大选中失势，美国政府已在日本举行大选的前夕公开出面为吉田自由党撑腰。
    美国国务院发言人十五日在华盛顿发表声明说：“国务院相信美国在日本开支的总数不会有很大的减少，至少在以后的两年内要维持相当高的水平。”共同社东京十六日电说：这个声明的目的是：“在政治上给亲美政权吉田内阁在参众两院的选举中打掩护”并使日本避免“陷入经济混乱状态”。吉田内阁的官房长官福永健司在十六日接见记者时也承认国务院的声明“目的在于消除日本实业界和经济界的不安”。华盛顿方面的消息进一步证实了国务院声明的这种意图。共同社驻华盛顿特派记者十五日报道说：“自从交换病伤战俘的谈判迅速开展以来，日本对于朝鲜特需前途感到非常不安”，“美国发表这个声明的目的就在于消除这种不安”，因为华盛顿方面认为：“这个声明对于日本几天以后的选举……将发生影响”。
    为了缓和日本经济界对当政的吉田自由党的不满，美国并在大选期间给了吉田政府四千万美元的棉花贷款。东京消息说：日本的“反对派从这些行动中看出美国正在支持亲美的吉田政权，他们说，在过去六年间，吉田政府就是在美国的支持下维持的。”
