On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland

    Construction Begins at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine
    This year's key construction projects at the state-owned Jiaozuo Coal Mine have commenced. These projects include the construction of the new Macun Main Mine, the renovation of Mine No. 39, exploration projects such as the Li Feng Mine's fault crossing, as well as masonry and tunneling work for roadways and winch paths. Additionally, there are new motor installations and the construction of factory buildings, dormitories, and hospitals.
    Jiaozuo Coal Mine has made relatively thorough preparations this year, transferring over a hundred cadres, technicians, and a large number of worker Party members and Youth League members to the basic construction side before the start of work. Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations have been established in each construction team. Currently, they are vigorously promoting advanced experiences such as assembly line operations, multi-head masonry, and safe and rapid drilling. In terms of material supply, except for certain special materials, the quantities of other engineering equipment, steel materials, timber, bricks, tiles, cement, etc., ordered are basically sufficient for the whole year. A large number of workers who have undergone winter training have now plunged into intense labor.
    Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant Begins to Play a Role
    The cold working, forging, and metal roughing workshops of the newly built state-owned Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, which have partially gone into production, have begun to play the role of a heavy machinery manufacturing plant. From January to April 15th this year, the forging workshop promptly supplied more than 14 tons of rivets, nuts, and other forgings needed for the plant's construction projects. The metal roughing workshop also produced winches, pile drivers, and a large number of production tools. The steel structure of the steel casting workshop, which has already risen high, was also entirely manufactured by the cold working workshop itself.
    These three workshops have also vigorously supported the basic construction of brother factories and mines. For example, when Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was building a larger-scale thin plate workshop, the base of the rolling mill, which was large and heavy, needed to be planed. At that time, it was difficult to find a machine factory in the entire North China region that could process it; however, the metal roughing workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant successfully completed this task. Over the past few months, these workshops have also produced a large number of rolling rolls and iron molds that ordinary machine manufacturing plants cannot manufacture for Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and precision machine tool lead screws of two to five meters for Taiyuan Machine Factory and Shanxi Machine Factory. They have also manufactured iron towers for erecting high-voltage lines and steel frames for substations for Taiyuan Power Supply Bureau. Taiyuan Cement Plant had been unable to find a suitable factory to process and manufacture bulky machinery and equipment for a long time in the past. In April of this year, these processing tasks were also sent to Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Zhengzhou Cotton Mill Has 20,000 Spindles in Production
    The civil engineering construction of the newly built state-owned Zhengzhou Cotton Textile Factory has been completed more than 70%, the mechanical installation has been basically completed, and nearly 20,000 spindles have been put into production. At present, all employees of the factory are striving to improve their technical level in order to welcome the full operation and production in the near future. The preparatory work for the construction of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has been largely completed, and it will officially start construction in May. After the completion of the above two factories, they can produce tens of thousands of pieces of yarn and more than one million bolts of cloth annually.
    Zhengzhou is the central city of Henan Province's cotton-producing area and the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai railways. The newly built cotton textile factory can use the large quantities of raw cotton produced in western and eastern Henan nearby, and the transportation of raw materials and finished products is also very convenient. Therefore, building a textile factory here can reduce production costs and provide the local urban and rural people with a large number of cheap yarn and cloth. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Yumen Oilfield Refinery Sets New Refining Record
    The Dabushe Cracking Refinery of Yumen Oilfield set a new record of 70 days for the furnace operation in the first quarter of this year.
    Whenever the furnaces of the Dabushe Cracking Refinery are started, slight coking will occur in the furnace tubes and other parts of the pipeline. When the coking becomes serious after a certain period, the furnace must be shut down for maintenance. Therefore, reducing the coking phenomenon can extend the operation time and increase production. In 1951, the longest furnace operation time was 40 days and 17 hours. In 1952, the highest operation time reached 56 days because a secondary evaporation tower was added. This year, because the overhaul in January was very meticulous; after the furnace was started, cadres and workers jointly organized an inspection team to conduct inspections day and night in turn; at the same time, the workers put forward some suggestions on technical safety measures, such as installing spare pipelines, etc., and promptly solved the problem of local coking in the pipelines. Therefore, from January 18th to March 29th, a new record of 70 consecutive days of operation was created. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Construction of a New Workers' Village in Anshan
    The new workers' village in Anshan City, Taiping Village, is about to start construction. The total area of this residential area is 250,000 square meters, which is larger than the total area of ​​Lishan residential area and simple residential area built last year. It is planned to complete 145,000 square meters this year. This residential area has family houses, single dormitories, schools, kindergartens, clinics, clubs, bathhouses, nurseries, and cooperatives. There are also two large heating boilers, one for staff dormitories and one for family dormitories. The style of the houses is a large courtyard set composed of many three-story buildings. Small gardens are dotted in the middle of the courtyard sets and between the courtyard sets. In the center of the village, there is a club that can accommodate 600 people, which is also surrounded by gardens. The design of this residential area has the characteristics of Chinese national architectural art, and the doors and windows are decorated with national-style carvings. Each household has wardrobes, kitchens and toilets, and cooking is done with gas.
    Now, more than 1,700 workers from the First Engineering Department of Anshan Civil Engineering Construction Company are busy preparing. As soon as the temporary engineering is completed and the overall construction plan comes, the overall construction will start. By autumn, 25,000 employees and their families will move into these new houses.
    Literary and Artistic Work Serves Basic Construction
    The Cultural and Education Department of Jilin Province convened responsible cadres of the province's drama troupe, Pingju troupe, Peking Opera troupe, library, film projection team, and other units in late March to discuss and formulate a work plan to cooperate with the province's basic construction, and determined to send the main forces of the province's drama, film, books, and other departments to the basic construction site. At the meeting, the drama troupe, Pingju troupe, and Peking Opera troupe all put forward specific performance plans, and decided to select the most exciting programs and perform more than 100 performances at the construction site. The film team decided to send out five teams to screen more than 270 screenings. The library plans to extract 1 million copies of popular reading materials for workers, specifically for workers at the construction site to read, and will designate someone to be responsible for this work.
    Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Finds New Ore
    The Jingdezhen City Ceramics Production Management Committee in Jiangxi Province organized advanced workers to form a mining team in February this year to find ore in the nearby mountains; farmers in the four townships also sent in the ore they found. A total of 69 new ores were found. Preliminary test results have proved that 14 kinds of them can be used, including Fuliang clay, Dachiwu stone, Zijin rock, refractory clay, feldspar white glaze, white talc, new gray glaze stone, and Longquan stone, and the quality is good, the output is high, and the cost is low. In the past, imported gold paint from the United States and Britain was used for painting porcelain, costing 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per bottle. Now, the gold paint made from new ore costs only 270,000 yuan per bottle, and it is brighter than the gold paint from the United States and Britain.
    Mobile Service Post Office on the Construction Site
    In order to support basic construction and facilitate construction workers at various construction sites to send letters and remittances, the Beijing Post Office has established a mobile service post office. The mobile service post office is equipped with a car and goes to various construction sites in the suburbs according to the payroll dates of construction workers to handle remittances, registered letters, insured letters, and small packages. As of early April, the mobile post office has been in contact with 63 units. Cadres and workers at the construction site welcome them very much.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    焦作煤矿基本建设工程开工
    国营焦作煤矿今年的基本建设主要工程已经开工。这些工程是：新建马村大井、改建三十九号井和李封矿过断层等勘探工程，以及巷道、绞车道等砌?工程和掘进工程。另外还有新电机安装，厂房、宿舍、医院等修建工程。
    焦作煤矿今年的准备工作做得比较充分，他们在开工前抽调了一百多个干部、技术人员和大批工人党员、团员到基本建设方面来。各工程大队的党、青年团和工会组织都已建立，目前，正大力推广流水作业、多头砌?、安全快速钻进等先进经验。在物资供应方面，除某些特殊材料外，其他工程设备和钢铁器材、木材、砖、瓦、水泥等的订购数量基本上已够全年使用。现在大批经过冬训的工人已投入紧张的劳动中。太原重型机器厂开始发挥作用
    新建国营太原重型机器厂部分投入生产的冷作、锻工、金工粗加工等三个车间，已初步发挥了重型机器制造厂的作用。从今年一月到四月十五日，锻工车间及时供应了本厂建设工程所需的十四吨多的铆钉、螺丝帽和其他锻件。金工粗加工车间也生产了卷扬机、打桩机和大批生产工具。现在已经高耸起来的该厂铸钢场房的钢架结构，也是全部由冷作车间自己制造的。
    这三个车间还有力地支援了兄弟工厂矿山的基本建设。如太原钢铁厂新建一个规模较大的薄板车间时，轧钢机的又大又重的底座需要刨平，当时在全华北也很难找到一家机器厂能够加工；而太原重型机器厂的金工粗加工车间，却顺利地完成了这个任务。几个月来，这几个车间并为太原钢铁厂生产了一般机器制造厂所不能制造的大批轧辊和铁模，为太原机器厂、山西机器厂生产了二公尺至五公尺的精密机床丝杠。还给太原电业局制造了架设高压线用的铁塔和变电所的钢架等。太原水泥厂过去很长时期找不到适当的工厂加工制造笨重的机器设备，今年四月份这些加工任务也送到太原重型机器厂来了。（新华社）郑州棉纺厂已有两万纱锭生产
    新建国营郑州棉纺织厂土木建筑工程已完成百分之七十以上，机械安装基本完毕，近两万个纱锭已投入生产。目前全厂职工正努力提高技术水平，以迎接不久以后的全部开工生产。国营郑州第一棉纺织厂的建厂准备工作已大体就绪，五月份将正式动工。以上两厂全部建成后，每年可生产数万件的纱和一百多万匹的布。
    郑州是河南省产棉区的中心城市，又是京汉、陇海两条铁路干线的交叉点。新建的棉纺织厂可以就近采用豫西、豫东等地大量出产的原棉，原材料和成品的运输也很方便。因此，在这里建设纺织厂可以减低生产成本，使当地城乡人民得到大批廉价的纱布。（新华社）
    玉门油矿一炼厂创开炼新纪录
    玉门油矿达布斯裂炼厂在今年第一季度内创造了我国炼炉开炼七十天的新纪录。
    达布斯裂炼厂的炼炉，每逢开炉以后，炉管和其他部分管线会发生轻微结焦现象，到一定时间结焦严重，就必须停炉检修。因此，减轻结焦现象，就可以延长开炼时间，增加产量。一九五一年，该厂炼炉开炼时间最长是四十天另十七小时，一九五二年因为增装了二级蒸发塔，开炼时间最高达到五十六天。今年因为一月份检修做得很细致；开炉以后，干部和工人又共同组织了检查组，轮流地日夜进行检查；同时，工人们提出了一些技术安全措施的建议，如安装了备用管线等，及时解决了管线局部结焦的问题。因而从一月十八日开炉到三月二十九日止，创造了连续开炼七十天的新纪录。
            （新华社）鞍山修建工人新村
    鞍山市新建的工人新村——太平村，就要开工了。这个住宅区的总面积是二十五万平方公尺，比去年修建的立山住宅和简易住宅的总和还大，今年计划先修好十四万五千平方公尺。这个住宅区里，有家族住宅、独身宿舍、学校、幼儿园、诊疗所、俱乐部、浴池、托儿所、合作社等。还有两个大暖气锅炉，一个供职工宿舍用，一个供家属宿舍用。房屋的样式是由许多三层楼房组成的大院套。院套中间和各个院套之间都点缀着小花园。村中央有一所能容六百人的俱乐部，也被花园围绕着。这个住宅区的设计有我国民族建筑艺术的特点，门窗上装饰着民族形式的雕刻。每一户的室内都有衣柜、厨房和厕所，做饭都用瓦斯。
    现在，鞍山土木建筑公司第一工程处一千七百多工人正在忙着做准备工作。暂设工程一修好，施工总平面图一来，就要全面动工了。到秋天，就将有两万五千个职工和他们的家属搬进这些新房子里来。文艺工作为基本建设服务
    吉林省文教厅在三月下旬召集该省话剧团、评剧团、京剧团、图书馆、电影放映队等单位的负责干部，讨论制订配合全省基本建设的工作计划，确定要把该省的戏剧、电影、图书等部门的主要力量送到基本建设工地去。会上，话剧团、评剧团、京剧团都提出了具体的演出计划，决定选出最精彩的节目，在工地演出百余场。电影队决定抽出五个队来，放映二百七十来场。图书馆预定抽出工人通俗读物一百万册，专供工地工人阅览，并将指定专人负责这一工作。江西景德镇找到了新矿石
    江西景德镇市陶瓷生产管理委员会，在今年二月间组织先进工人成立了采矿小组，在附近山上找矿；四乡农民也都纷纷把找到的矿石送来。一共找到了六十九种新矿石。初步试验结果，证明有浮梁粘土、打杵坞石，紫金岩石、耐火土，长石白釉、白滑石子、新灰釉石、龙泉石等十四种都能用，而且质量好，产量多，成本低。过去画瓷都要用美国、英国进口的金水，每瓶七八十万元，现在用新矿石做成的金水，每瓶只要二十七万元，而且比英美的金水更光亮。工地上的流动服务邮局
    北京邮局为了支援基本建设，便利各工地建筑工人寄信、汇款，成立了一个流动服务邮局。流动服务邮局备有汽车，按照建筑工人发薪日期，分别去郊区各个工地办理汇款、收寄挂号信、保价信和小包裹等业务。截至四月上旬止，流动邮局已和六十三个单位有了联系。工地的干部和工人们都很欢迎他们。
