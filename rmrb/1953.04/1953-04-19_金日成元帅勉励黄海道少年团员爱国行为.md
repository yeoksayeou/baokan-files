Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 18th: The leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il-sung, wrote a letter to the Young Pioneers of Hwanghae Province on the 13th, expressing his gratitude and encouragement for their patriotic enthusiasm in donating funds to support the front lines. Like the children in Pyongyang and many other places in Korea, the Young Pioneers of Hwanghae Province use their spare time to collect scrap iron and rice ears in an organized manner, donating the money from their sale to the state. They have already obtained 5.5 million Korean won (equivalent to about 355 seok of rice at market prices) in this way. At a recent conference of Young Pioneer activists in Hwanghae Province, they decided to write a letter to Marshal Kim Il-sung, donating this money as "support-the-front fund" to help the country further strengthen the Korean People's Army. The Young Pioneer members wrote in the letter: "We proudly feel in this movement to support the front lines: Gathering scattered strength can become a great force for winning the war." They swore to their beloved leader that they would love the motherland and the people even more, hate the enemy, study hard, and advance victoriously. In his reply, Marshal Kim Il-sung expressed his gratitude to them and pointed out that the patriotic actions of the Young Pioneers would help the Korean People's Army further strengthen its armed forces and would greatly encourage the commanders and fighters of the People's Army. Marshal Kim Il-sung encouraged the Young Pioneer members to study harder and strive for greater achievements in supporting the front lines.

    金日成元帅勉励黄海道少年团员爱国行为
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅在十三日写信给黄海道少年团员们，对他们捐款支援前线的爱国热情表示感谢和勉励。黄海道的少年团员们像平壤及朝鲜其他许多地方的少年儿童们一样，利用课余时间，有组织地拾收废铁和稻穗，把变卖得来的钱捐献给国家。他们已用这种办法得到朝鲜币五百五十万元（按市价折合大米约三百五十五石）。在最近举行的黄海道少年团积极分子大会上，他们决定写信给金日成元帅，把这笔钱捐献为“支前金”，帮助国家进一步加强朝鲜人民军。少年团团员们在信中写道：“我们在这个支援前线的运动中自豪地感觉到：把零星的力量集合起来，就可以成为争取战争胜利的巨大力量。”他们向自己敬爱的领袖宣誓：要更加热爱祖国和人民，痛恨敌人，努力学习，胜利前进。金日成元帅在复信中向他们表示感谢，并指出：少年团员们的这种爱国行动，将帮助朝鲜人民军进一步加强武装力量，而且对人民军指挥员和战斗员将起很大的鼓舞作用。金日成元帅勉励少年团团员们要更加努力地学习，并在支援前线的工作中争取更大的成就。
