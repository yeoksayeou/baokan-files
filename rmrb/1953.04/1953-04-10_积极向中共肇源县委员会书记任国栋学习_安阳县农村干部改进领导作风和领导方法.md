Rural Cadres in Anyang County Improve Leadership Style and Methods by Actively Learning from Ren Guodong, Secretary of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee

    Rural cadres in Anyang County, Henan Province, actively learned from Ren Guodong, Secretary of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee, and improved their leadership style and methods.

    After the Spring Festival this year, the Party and government leading organs of Anyang County put forward the task of intensifying leadership to guide farmers in spring plowing preparations, doing a good job in wheat field management, and striving for a bumper wheat harvest. At that time, many district and township cadres had just criticized bureaucratic and formalistic leadership styles, and for a time were somewhat at a loss on how to lead farmers in spring plowing production, falling into depression.

    After the People's Daily published a report introducing the experience of Ren Guodong, Secretary of the CCP Zhaoyuan County Committee, in leading production, the CCP Anyang County Committee immediately issued instructions, requiring Party organizations at all levels to seriously organize cadres to study Ren Guodong's leadership methods. Subsequently, at an enlarged cadre meeting in Anyang County, leading cadres of the CCP Anyang County Committee not only reiterated the importance of studying Ren Guodong's leadership methods, but also guided the cadres present to conduct self-examination in light of Ren Guodong's leadership methods, calling on everyone to further develop this study movement. After the meeting, members of the CCP Anyang County Committee went to key production villages to create working experiences suitable to local conditions, in order to promote the general. Shen Gengxi, member of the CCP Anyang County Committee and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, led a work team to Xujiagou Village, where they used Ren Guodong's leadership methods to inspect wheat seedlings, count wheat ears, weigh wheat grains, calculate yields, and tap potential, and summarized the farmers' existing production experience, held material exhibitions, identified key factors for increasing production, and eliminated the conservative thinking of the villagers who believed that a bumper wheat harvest was hopeless. After this experience was promoted throughout the county, it dispelled the doubts of some cadres who thought that Ren Guodong's leadership methods were not suitable for local conditions. However, some cadres mistakenly regarded Ren Guodong's leadership methods as using high-yield figures to stir up the emotions of the farmers. At this time, members of the CCP Anyang County Committee went to various districts to take on apprentices, enabling the vast majority of cadres to grasp the basic spirit of Ren Guodong's leadership methods and improve their work style.

    While carrying out the movement to study Ren Guodong's leadership methods, the CCP Anyang County Committee paid great attention to organizing cadres to study agricultural technology. Whenever an agricultural activity began, the CCP Anyang County Committee held a certain number of cadre meetings according to the progress of the work to specifically study agricultural technology. Many cadres, who had originally thought that the country had already begun large-scale economic construction, and that their own level was low and their ability was poor, and were eager to return home, have now learned new leadership methods, increased their agricultural production technical knowledge, and their work confidence has been greatly enhanced.

    At present, the spring plowing production movement in Anyang County is developing vigorously. Wheat throughout the county has generally been harrowed twice, more than 60 percent of the wheat fields have been top-dressed with fertilizer, and farmers in more than 160 villages have joined the patriotic production increase competition.

    积极向中共肇源县委员会书记任国栋学习
    安阳县农村干部改进领导作风和领导方法
    河南省安阳县农村干部积极向中共肇源县委员会书记任国栋学习，改进了领导作风和领导方法。
    今年春节过后，安阳县党、政领导机关就提出了加紧领导农民进行春耕准备，并做好麦田管理、争取小麦丰收的任务。当时，不少区、乡干部刚批判过官僚主义和形式主义的领导作风，一时对领导农民春耕生产有些不知所措，而陷入了苦闷。
    人民日报发表介绍中共肇源县委员会书记任国栋领导生产经验的通讯后，中共安阳县委员会当即发出指示，要求各区、乡党组织认真组织干部学习任国栋的领导方法。此后，在安阳县扩大干部会议上，中共安阳县委员会领导干部一面再次说明学习任国栋领导方法的重要意义，一面引导到会干部对照任国栋领导方法进行自我检查，号召大家进一步开展这一学习运动。会后，中共安阳县委员会各委员分头深入生产重点村，创造适合于当地情况的工作经验，以推动一般。中共安阳县委员会委员兼宣传部副部长申更喜率领工作组，在许家沟村运用任国栋的领导方法，进行查麦棵，数麦穗，秤麦粒，计算产量，挖掘潜在力，并总结农民群众已有的生产经验，举行实物展览，找出增产关键，消除了该村农民认为小麦丰收无望的保守思想。这一经验在全县推广后，清除了一部分干部认为任国栋领导方法不适合本地情况的疑虑。但是，还有一部分干部把任国栋的领导方法，错误地看做是用高产量数字来轰动农民群众的情绪。这时，中共安阳县委员会委员又分赴各区带徒弟，使绝大部分干部掌握了任国栋领导方法的基本精神，改进了工作作风。
    在开展学习任国栋领导方法运动的同时，中共安阳县委员会很注意组织干部学习农业技术。每当一种农事活动开始时，中共安阳县委员会就根据工作进展情况，召开一定数量的干部会议，专门研究、学习农业技术。不少干部原来认为国家已经开始大规模经济建设，自己水平低、能力差，急于要求回家，现在都学会了新的领导方法，增加了农业生产技术知识，工作信心已大大提高。
    目前，安阳县春耕生产运动正蓬勃展开。全县小麦普遍耙过两遍，百分之六十以上的麦田都施了追肥，一百六十多个村庄的农民已投入爱国增产竞赛。（新华社）
