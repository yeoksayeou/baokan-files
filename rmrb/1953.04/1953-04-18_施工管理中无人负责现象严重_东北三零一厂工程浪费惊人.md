Serious Lack of Responsibility in Construction Management
Shocking Waste in Northeast 301 Factory Project

The Northeast 301 Factory is one of the most important projects in heavy industry's basic construction. The entire factory area is over 600,000 square meters, with a large 120-meter-high chimney. The main factory buildings are of steel structure, with the electrolytic workshop installation alone requiring more than 4,000 tons of steel. The foundation bolts for the electrolytic workshop weigh 45 tons, and the largest workshop foundation requires 1,600 cubic meters of concrete. The first phase of the project, mainly the foundation work for various equipment and buildings, began last year. Due to numerous problems in construction organization and management, not only was the state-assigned task not completed last year, but serious waste occurred during construction. This is specifically manifested in:

I. Very poor project quality. Concrete foundation work was the most important part of construction last year. Of 214 strength tests, 85 test results were below design requirements, with the most severe reaching only 30% of the design requirements. Among the 7,000-plus cubic meters of concrete already poured, there were 138 large and small "pockmarks," "honeycombs," and "dog holes," with the largest "dog hole" covering an area of 60 square centimeters. Of the 92 electrolytic cell foundations already installed, 43 did not meet quality standards. The rework losses for just 39 intake covers and 13 electrolytic cells wasted 120 million yuan and significantly impacted the project's lifespan.

II. Slow project progress. Only 81.2% of the annual construction and installation workload was completed, with the most important electrolytic cell foundation project only 63.9% complete. It is estimated that the start of production will be delayed by three months.

III. Significant waste during construction, with material losses alone reaching over 430 million yuan. There were over 32,000 instances of idle labor and over 15,000 instances of work stoppage due to lack of materials, accounting for 25% of the total annual labor requirement.

The above-mentioned waste is inseparable from the lack of responsibility in various tasks. This is specifically manifested in:

I. Failure to complete plans, with no one taking responsibility. For example, the North Electrolytic Cell project was 78% complete by November 1st last year. It was halted due to the failure to promptly supply materials. However, materials were supplied steadily from the 5th onwards, and the weather turned warmer. If the project office had focused on material processing and organized construction, it would have been possible to complete this project. However, due to the lack of responsibility, the project has to wait until the ground thaws this year to continue construction, delaying the project by five months. Another example is the wood drying room project, which had a scheduled construction period of only 50 days, but was delayed for more than two months simply because no one took responsibility for supplying small screws for the doors and windows.

II. Poor quality with no one taking responsibility. Records of concrete strength failing to meet requirements were sent to the project office director and the technical inspection section's office each time, but no one ever seriously reviewed them. No one monitored the water-cement ratio of the concrete for the base of the large chimney foundation. The design specified a slump of 2-3 centimeters, but workers arbitrarily increased it to over 10 centimeters, and no one intervened. The number of concrete engineering quality incidents increased month by month, but few people conducted in-depth inspections or tried to improve the situation, allowing construction workers and laborers to privately fill "honeycombs" and "dog holes" and conceal quality accidents.

III. Lack of responsibility in organization and leadership. In September of last year, when a large amount of construction was underway, no one was specifically responsible for unified command of the various projects. Each workshop did its own thing, and the various types of work were not coordinated with each other. When progress was not completed, they passed the buck to each other. Technical personnel had no defined responsibilities and were frequently transferred, leaving the site. The project office director was concurrently the director of the 301 Factory and rarely went deep into the site to solve problems. The deputy director (who has been suspended for reflection) was nominally in charge of leading the construction, but in reality, he was "doing his own thing." During the busiest construction periods of October, November, and December, he took an assistant engineer to another construction site to "create" rapid construction methods. In early November, the deputy director went to attend the Northeast Advanced Producer Representatives Conference, and the assistant engineer took leave of absence on the pretext of illness, leaving such a huge construction task in the hands of a technician, resulting in chaos on the site and a peak in quality accidents. Furthermore, no one was responsible for promoting advanced experience. For example, plumbing worker Bao Wanfa created an electric threading machine that doubled work efficiency, but no one was responsible for summarizing it. When Bao Wanfa was transferred, he took the threading machine with him, and it was never promoted.

Another reason for the waste is that the project office cadres generally lacked an economic accounting perspective and had a very unclear understanding of the integrated nature of project progress, quality, and cost, holding a one-sided, purely progress-oriented viewpoint.

I. Disregarding costs. For example, when financial personnel reviewed and reduced the budget for construction tools once, the project office deputy director criticized the financial department at a meeting, saying: "Don't worry about how much the budget is. If the site needs it, you have to give it!" For example, in early December, the South Electrolytic Cell project lacked 2,000 square meters of templates. It would have been possible to switch the templates from the North Electrolytic Cell project for use, but they were reluctant to spend time dismantling the templates, so they were transported from Shenyang by truck. However, because the specifications were inconsistent, they were not suitable, causing great waste.

II. Overestimation and Overuse. The phenomenon of blindly expanding budgets for the convenience of construction was very common. For example, the initial template budget for the North Electrolytic Cell project was 22,000 square meters, which was later revised to 16,000 square meters, but only 12,000 square meters were actually used. Another example is the material warehouse project, which had a budget of 1.1 billion yuan, but the actual final account was only over 59 million yuan.

III. Emphasizing Progress and Neglecting Quality. General construction personnel believed that "if progress is fast, quality will inevitably be affected." For example, in order to strive for the completion of the large chimney foundation project by the end of 1952, the construction worker ordered the workers to pour concrete after the rebar and templates were installed without cleaning them. Fortunately, it was discovered and stopped by the inspector. The cleaning resulted in three cartloads of wood chips and debris. If these debris had not been cleaned up, it would have caused serious rework and waste.

IV. Not Preparing Project Budgets. Although many project agreements and contracts were signed between the two parties, budgets were added while construction was underway. From the start of construction last year to November, budgets were added 142 times. The budget was even delayed until after completion, such as the power distribution project and the graphite furnace project, which were actually completed in June and July respectively, but the project budget was not submitted until November. The original records at the site only contained labor figures, and there was no accurate account of how much material was used.

    施工管理中无人负责现象严重
    东北三零一厂工程浪费惊人
    东北三零一厂是重工业基本建设中最主要的工程之一，全厂面积有六十多万平方公尺，有一百二十公尺高的大烟囱，主要厂房都是钢铁结构，只电解车间安装工程就需要四千多吨的钢材，仅电解车间的基础螺丝就有四十五吨，最大车间基础工程要用一千六百立方公尺的混凝土。第一期工程，主要是各种设备、建筑物的基础工程，已于去年动工。该工程是由重工业部东北有色金属工业管理局工程公司承包的。由于施工组织管理存在着许多问题，去年不仅没有完成国家规定的任务，并在施工中发生严重的浪费现象。具体表现在：
    一、工程质量很不好。基础混凝土工程是去年施工中最主要的部分，强度试验二百一十四次，有八十五次的试验结果低于设计要求，最严重的只达设计要求的百分之三十；已浇灌的七千余立方公尺混凝土中，大小“麻面”、“蜂窝”、“狗洞”共有一百三十八处，其中最大的“狗洞”面积达六十平方公分。已安装的九十二个电解槽基础中，有四十三个槽子不合质量标准。仅三十九个吸气口盖和十三个电解槽的返工损失，就浪费了一亿二千万元，并使工程寿命遭受很大影响。
    二、工程进度缓慢。全年建筑安装工作量仅完成百分之八十一点二，最主要的电解槽基础工程仅完成百分之六十三点九。据估计将使开工生产时间推迟三个月。
    三、施工中的浪费很大，仅材料一项的损失即达四亿三千余万元。全年窝工三万二千多个，停工待料损失一万五千多工，共占全年所需人工总量的百分之二十五。
    上述浪费现象与各项工作无人负责是分不开的。具体表现在：
    一、计划完不成，无人负责。如北电解槽工程至去年十一月一日已完成百分之七十八，因未能及时供应材料即行停工，但从五日起材料已源源供应，而且气候转暖，如果工程处抓紧材料加工和组织施工，争取完成此项工程是有可能的；但因无人负责，要等今年解冻后才能继续施工，使该项工程工期拖延五个月之久。又如木材干燥室工程，规定的工期只有五十天，但仅仅因为门窗小螺丝的供应无人负责，拖延工期达两个月以上。
    二、质量低劣无人负责。混凝土强度不够的试验纪录，每次都送到工程处主任和技术检查科的办公室里，但从来没有人认真查阅。大烟囱基础底层混凝土的水灰比重无人掌握，设计规定塌落度二至三公分，工人任意加大十公分以上，也无人过问。混凝土工程质量事故一月比一月多，但很少有人深入检查，设法改善，任凭施工员与工人私下涂塞“蜂窝”、“狗洞”，隐瞒质量事故。
    三、组织领导无人负责。去年九月份大量工程施工，各项工程无专人负责统一指挥，车间各搞一套，工种与工种互不配合，进度完不成互相推诿。技术人员职责不定，经常调动脱离现场。工程处正主任由三零一厂厂长兼职，很少深入现场解决问题；副主任（已停职反省）名义上是具体领导施工，实际上是“自搞一套”，在十、十一、十二月份施工最紧张时期，他却带着助理工程师去另外一个工地“创造”快速施工法。十一月初，副主任去参加东北先进生产者代表会，助理工程师则借故请假，把这样巨大的施工任务交给一个技术员负责，结果造成现场混乱，质量事故达到高峰。另外先进经验也无人负责推广。如水暖工人包万发创造电动套丝机，提高工作效率二倍，但无人负责总结，包万发调动工作时，也就把套丝机带走了，始终未得到推广。
    产生浪费的另一个原因，是工程处的干部普遍缺乏经济核算观点，对工程进度、质量和成本三位一体的认识很不明确，存在着片面的单纯进度观点。
    一、不计工本。如有一次财务人员审核削减了施工工具预算，而工程处副主任就在大会上批评财务部门说：“预算多少你们不要管，现场要用就得给！”又如十二月初南电解槽工程缺乏二千平方公尺的模板，本可把北电解槽工程的模板串换着使用，但却嫌拆模板费时间，于是就从沈阳用汽车运来，但因规格不一致又不适用，造成很大浪费。
    二、宽打宽用。为了施工方便，盲目扩大预算的现象是很普遍的。如北电解槽工程模板预算第一次提出二万二千平方公尺，后来修改为一万六千平方公尺，但实际上只用了一万二千平方公尺。又如材料仓库工程，预算是十一亿，作出的决算只有五千九百余万元。
    三、抢进度忽视质量。一般施工人员认为“进度快了，质量总得受影响”。如为了争取大烟囱基础工程在一九五二年底竣工，钢筋、模板安装之后未经清扫，施工员就叫工人浇灌混凝土，幸被检查员发现制止。清扫结果，木片杂物装满三辆马车。这些杂物如果不加清理，就要造成严重的返工浪费。
    四、不做工程预算。双方虽然订了不少工程协议书和合同，但是一边施工一边追加预算，去年开工以来至十一月止，追加预算达一百四十二次。甚至预算落在竣工之后，如配电工程、石墨化炉工程实际上在六、七月份已先后完工，工程预算却迟至十一月才提出来。在现场的原始记录，只有人工数字，材料使用多少没有正确的账目。
