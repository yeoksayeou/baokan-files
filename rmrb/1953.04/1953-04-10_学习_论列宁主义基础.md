    Studying “Foundations of Leninism”
    Qi Yi
    "Foundations of Leninism" was published in 1924. At that time, the Soviet state was nearing the completion of its national economic recovery, and the Party put forward the task of advancing towards socialism. It was at this critical moment that the Party suffered its greatest misfortune – the death of Lenin. All the enemies of socialism intensified their attacks on the Party. The main enemy at the time, the Trotskyite gang, openly denied the possibility of building socialism in one country, painstakingly prepared conditions for the restoration of capitalism, and attempted to replace Marxism-Leninism with the disruptive Trotskyism. Comrade Stalin inherited Lenin's cause and led the Party to defeat the enemies obstructing the socialist road. This theoretical work, "Foundations of Leninism," was of great significance for crushing Trotskyism and protecting Marxism-Leninism. This work armed the communist parties of all countries, then and now, with sharp Marxist-Leninist theory.

    In this work, Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of Leninism: "Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. More precisely: Leninism is generally the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution, and particularly the theory and tactics of the dictatorship of the proletariat." This definition points out that "Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution," indicating the international significance of Leninism for the proletarian parties of all countries, and that the main point of Leninism is the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this work, Comrade Stalin elaborated on Leninism in nine parts: the historical roots, theory, method, dictatorship of the proletariat, peasant question, national question, strategy and tactics, the Party, and work style.

    Comrade Stalin first clarified the historical roots of Leninism, pointing out that "Leninism grew up under the conditions of imperialism, that is, when the contradictions of capitalism had reached their extreme point, when the proletarian revolution had become a direct practical question, when the old period of preparing the working class for revolution had come to an end, and had transformed into a new period of directly assaulting capitalism." Comrade Stalin made a profound analysis of the contradictions of capitalism in the era of imperialism, pointing out the three basic contradictions: between labor and capital, between imperialist powers, and between imperialism and colonies and dependent countries, to demonstrate that revolution had not only become an inevitable fact at this time, but also created favorable conditions for directly breaking through capitalism. He pointed out that the reason why the revolution first broke out in Russia was because Tsarist Russia was the gathering point of all the contradictions of all imperialist powers; in Russia there existed a powerful revolutionary force – the most revolutionary proletariat in the world, a revolutionary peasantry allied with the proletariat, and Lenin's Party leading the worker-peasant revolutionary movement. Thus, Russia became the birthplace of Leninism, and Lenin, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, became the creator of Leninism.

    Lenin, based on the Marxist worldview, developed the method and theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Comrade Stalin pointed out that Lenin's method was tempered in a resolute struggle against the opportunists of the Second International, replacing the methods of reform and perfunctoriness with the revolutionary critical method. Comrade Stalin said: "Lenin's method not only restored Marx's critical revolutionary method, not only restored Marx's materialist dialectics, but also concretized and advanced this method."

    Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory is the only scientific theory that moves forward. Only a party armed with this theory can discern the direction in a complex environment and confidently lead the people forward. Comrade Stalin here severely refuted the "spontaneity" theory, pointing out that this kind of argument "in fact denies...the leading role of the working class party." Lenin's theory of socialist revolution is a creative development of Marxism. Lenin, from the law of uneven political and economic development of imperialism, found the principle that revolution could be victorious in one country; Comrade Stalin, in the struggle with the Trotskyite gang, defended and developed Lenin's principle. This work discusses that a country where the revolution has been victorious can and should build socialism. Based on this idea, in "The October Revolution and the Tactics of the Russian Communists," Comrade Stalin clearly pointed out that the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class can completely overcome internal difficulties and build socialism. And the complete guarantee to be exempted from the restoration of the old system can only be achieved through
    "the common efforts of the proletarians of several countries." Lenin and Stalin's theory of socialist revolution powerfully armed the fraternal parties of all countries in the world. Chairman Mao, in such a difficult period in 1928, confidently demonstrated "Why is it that Red Political Power Can Exist?" ("Why is it that Red Political Power Can Exist in China?"), which is completely in accordance with Lenin and Stalin's principle. Chairman Mao analyzed the specific situation in China at that time and came to a series of conclusions regarding the extreme imbalance of China's economic and political development, and the extreme imbalance of revolutionary development determined by it, and the possibility of the revolution using the enemy's weaknesses to establish long-term revolutionary base areas in the countryside. This series of conclusions pointed out a clear path to the victory of the Chinese revolution.

    Lenin said: "The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power." The fundamental question of the proletarian revolution is to maintain and consolidate the power seized by using the dictatorship of the proletariat as a tool. In this work, Comrade Stalin clarified the most important tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat, demonstrated the historical significance of these tasks, and developed Lenin's idea that the Soviet regime is the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, making this idea a systematic theory of the socialist state. Later, in "Some Questions Concerning Leninism," Comrade Stalin emphasized that the main point of Leninism is the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and stipulated the three inseparable basic aspects of the dictatorship of the proletariat, namely, "utilizing the proletarian regime to suppress the exploiters, defend the country, consolidate the connections with the proletarians of other countries, and ensure the development and victory of the revolution in all countries of the world"; "utilizing the proletarian regime to completely separate the exploited working masses from the bourgeoisie, consolidate the alliance between the proletariat and these masses, absorb these masses to participate in the cause of socialist construction, and ensure the proletariat's state leadership over these masses"; "utilizing the proletarian regime to organize the socialist system, eliminate classes, and ensure the transition to a classless society, a stateless society." These three inseparable basic aspects are the guarantee of the development and victory of the Soviet state and the revolution throughout the world, and are the guarantee of realizing the leadership of the proletariat and achieving communism in socialist construction. At the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin also pointed out that even when entering communism under capitalist encirclement, it is still necessary to preserve the state organs. These principles have very important significance for current revolutionary practice. Comrade Malenkov said in his summary report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "In the case where the socialist revolution has already achieved victory in one country, and capitalism still rules most other countries, the country that has already won the revolution must never weaken its state, but must make every effort to consolidate it." Today, all the people's democratic countries are consolidating their regimes based on Lenin and Stalin's teachings. Chairman Mao said at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Our state system of people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to safeguard the victory of the people's revolution and oppose the restoration conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad. We must firmly grasp this weapon." All the great achievements of New China are guaranteed by this powerful weapon.

    The peasant question and the national question are component parts of the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and are questions of the allies of the proletariat in the struggle to seize power and build socialism. Based on the historical materials of the three Russian revolutions, Comrade Stalin pointed out how Leninism organized the worker-peasant alliance into a powerful force under the leadership of the working class. And he pointed out that this force is invincible in the period of proletarian revolution and also invincible in the period of socialist construction. In this book, Comrade Stalin clarified the Marxist-Leninist principle of transforming small-scale peasant economy into large-scale collective agriculture, pointing out that the path of developing agriculture pointed out by Lenin is the correct path that the peasants are willing to take. Later, the Soviet Union realized agricultural collectivization based on Lenin's cooperative plan. The peasant question is of great significance for the proletarian revolution, especially for the colonial and semi-colonial revolution led by the proletariat. Comrade Stalin pointed out more clearly in another work: The question of colonies and semi-colonies is essentially the peasant question. And he especially pointed out: "The faster and more thoroughly the Chinese peasants are drawn into the revolution, the more powerful and stronger the anti-imperialist united front of China will be." ("The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution") Indeed, the peasant question is a question that affects the overall situation of the Chinese revolution. As early as 1927, Chairman Mao foresaw that the peasant movement "will break through all the nets that bind them and run rapidly towards the road of liberation. All imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry will be buried by them." ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan") Chen Duxiu's line and the Trotskyite gang's views were consistent in wrongly estimating the peasants. After they betrayed this revolution, they joined forces. Chairman Mao and the Party resolutely led the peasant revolution. The historical facts of the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution fully proved the wisdom of Stalin and Chairman Mao and the correctness of Leninism.

    The national question and the peasant question are closely related. Both are questions of the reserve forces of the proletarian revolution, and both are part of the general question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Of course, we must not confuse the two. Because the national question is not only the peasant question, but also includes national culture and national states. Leninism linked the national question with the colonial question, "and thus the national question was transformed from a local and domestic question into a general and international question, and into a world question of the oppressed nations of dependent countries and colonies breaking free from the shackles of imperialism." This pointed out that the national question can be resolved on the basis of the proletarian revolution and in its interrelationship. Leninism deals with the national question on the principle of internationalism. Comrade Stalin not only criticized the erroneous views of nationalists and reformists, developed Leninism's theory on the national question, and also determined the national policy, and correctly solved the national question. Comrade Malenkov said: "Comrade Stalin is the greatest theorist on the national question. For the first time in history, he eliminated generations of national strife within a large multinational country." (Speech at the Stalin Memorial Meeting held in Moscow) The indestructible unity and friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union has been tested by the flames of the Patriotic War. The Chinese Communist Party's principles of internationalism and national equality are manifested in the Party's minimum program—the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference. Externally: "The People's Republic of China unites with all countries and peoples in the world who love peace and freedom, first of all, unites with the Soviet Union, all People's Democratic countries, and all oppressed nations, stands on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, and jointly opposes imperialist aggression in order to guarantee lasting world peace." Internally: "All nationalities within the territory of the People's Republic of China are equal, practice unity and mutual assistance, oppose imperialism and the people's enemies within all nationalities, and make the People's Republic of China a big family of friendly cooperation among all nationalities. Oppose great-nation chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and prohibit acts of hostility, oppression and splitting national unity among nationalities." The unprecedented unity of all nationalities in China today is inseparable from the teachings of Marxism-Leninism-Stalin.

    "Strategy and tactics are the science of leading the proletarian class struggle." Strategy is formulated based on the Party's theory and program. "Strategy is to determine the main direction of attack by the proletariat in a certain stage of the revolution, to formulate a corresponding plan for the deployment of revolutionary forces (the main and secondary reserve forces), and to struggle throughout this stage of the revolution to realize this plan." Tactics are part of strategy, and are subordinate to strategy and serve the realization of strategic plans. Therefore, tactics must change with the ups and downs of the revolutionary movement. Comrade Stalin is a great revolutionary strategist, and the strategy and tactics formulated by Comrade Stalin enriched the Marxist-Leninist arsenal. Lenin and Stalin's strategy and tactics teach the fraternal parties of all countries to win over the proletariat, the working masses, and unite around themselves, and to struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The Chinese Communist Party, led by Chairman Mao, had long learned the combat experience of the Soviet Communist Party and implemented the correct line based on the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, and thus had a clear position and attitude towards other classes in each revolutionary stage. Leninism's principle of correctly using reserve forces is specifically manifested as the united front in the Chinese revolution. The idea of both uniting and struggling with the bourgeoisie in the New Democratic Revolution is Chairman Mao's important contribution to the science of Leninism's strategy and tactics. Regarding the form of struggle in the Chinese revolution, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." ("The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution") This main form of struggle runs through all stages of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao's wise use of the strategic and tactical principles of Leninism was the decisive factor in the victory of the Chinese revolution.

    The Party is the fighting headquarters of the proletariat, and the Leninist party is the leading force for the proletariat to seize power, consolidate power, and carry out construction. Comrade Stalin clearly pointed out the characteristics of this new type of party: "The Party is the advanced detachment of the working class," "The Party is the organized detachment of the working class," "The Party is the highest form of proletarian class organization," "The Party is the tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat," "The Party is the unity of will, not allowing the existence of factional organizations," "The Party is consolidated by clearing out the opportunists in its midst." The Soviet Communist Party created by Lenin and Stalin is a new type of party with these characteristics, and the Soviet Communist Party is an example for the communist parties of all countries. Lenin and Stalin's theory of party building played a huge role in the construction and consolidation of the fraternal parties. The Chinese Communist Party was built in accordance with the Bolshevik Party. The general program of the Chinese Communist Party Constitution stipulates: "The Communist Party of China is the advanced and organized detachment of the Chinese working class, and is the highest form of its class organization. The Communist Party of China represents the interests of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. At the present stage, it struggles to realize the New Democratic system in China. Its ultimate goal is to realize the communist system in China." Comrade Liu Shaoqi fully demonstrated in the document "On the Party" that our Party is a completely new type of Marxist-Leninist party. Our Party has grown stronger in the struggle with class enemies, and has been consolidated in the struggle with all non-proletarian ideological and political tendencies within the Party. The reason why our Party is glorious, great, and correct is because all our work is guided by Chairman Mao's thought of combining Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution.

    The last part of this book is "Work Style." "Leninism is a school of theory and practice, it can create a special style of Party and state workers." The work style of Lenin and Stalin has the characteristic of combining revolutionary courage with a realistic spirit. This characteristic is the specific embodiment of the fighting, scientific method and theory, and this characteristic is the yardstick for measuring the maturity of revolutionary cadres. The Chinese Communist Party cultivated cadres with a work style of unifying theory and practice, closely linking with the masses, and criticism and self-criticism, enabling a large number of outstanding cadres to master the weapon of action. Chairman Mao used great efforts to struggle against wrong ideological styles. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Dogmatism and empiricism are both subjectivism" ("Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing"), and these two types of subjectivism are the ideological basis of right-leaning and "left"-leaning opportunism within the Party. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our Party earnestly studied the work style of the Soviet Communist Party, making our Party a strong Marxist-Leninist party that can victoriously complete any historical task.

    Comrade Stalin's glorious life is worthy of being the successor to the great cause of Lenin. He armed the communist parties and the broad progressive masses of the world with Leninism, made the cause of human liberation advance by leaps and bounds, and made our era an era where all roads lead to communism.

    Chairman Mao pointed out in "The Greatest Friendship": "Since Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin has always been the central figure of the world communist movement. We surround him, constantly consult him, and constantly draw ideological strength from his works." Chairman Mao called the immortal works "Foundations of Leninism", "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" as the encyclopedia of Marxism-Leninism and the summary of the experience of the world communist movement in the past century.

    In order to commemorate Comrade Stalin, in order to "advance along the road that leads the great cause of Lenin-Stalin to complete victory" (Malenkov's speech at the Stalin Memorial Meeting held in Moscow), we must intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism and Stalin's teachings in the struggle, and put what we have learned into practice.

    学习“论列宁主义基础”
    齐一
    “论列宁主义基础”是在一九二四年发表的。当时苏维埃国家恢复国民经济的工作已接近完成，党提出了向社会主义前进的任务。正在这个严重的时机，党遭到了最大的不幸——列宁逝世了。一切社会主义的敌人都加紧向党进攻。当时主要的敌人托洛茨基匪帮，公然否定在一国建成社会主义的可能性，处心积虑地为资本主义的复辟准备条件，妄图以瓦解革命的托洛茨基主义代替马克思列宁主义。斯大林同志继承了列宁的事业，领导着党击溃阻碍社会主义道路的敌人。“论列宁主义基础”这一理论著作，对于粉碎托洛茨基主义和保护马克思列宁主义，有着极大的意义。这部著作以锋利的马克思列宁主义的理论，武装着当时和现在的各国共产党。
    斯大林同志在这部著作中，为列宁主义下了一个经典的定义：“列宁主义是帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。更确切些说：列宁主义一般是无产阶级革命底理论和策略，特别是无产阶级专政底理论和策略。”这个定义指出，“列宁主义是帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义”，指出了列宁主义适用于各国无产阶级政党的国际意义，指出了列宁主义的主要之点是无产阶级专政问题。斯大林同志在这部著作中，分成列宁主义底历史根源、理论、方法、无产阶级专政、农民问题、民族问题、战略与策略、党、工作作风九个部分来阐述。
    斯大林同志首先阐明了列宁主义的历史根源，指出“列宁主义是在帝国主义条件下，即是在资本主义底矛盾已达到极点，无产阶级革命已成为直接实践问题，准备工人阶级去进行革命的旧时期已达到尽头，而转变成了直接冲击资本主义的新时期的条件下长大形成的”。斯大林同志对于帝国主义时代资本主义的矛盾进行了深刻的分析，指出劳动与资本间、各帝国主义间、帝国主义与殖民地和依赖国间的三个基本矛盾，以论证这时革命不仅已成为不可避免的事实，而且为直接冲破资本主义创造了有利条件。指出革命所以首先在俄国爆发，是因为帝俄是所有帝国主义所有一切矛盾的集合点；在俄国存在着强大的革命力量——世界上最富有革命性的无产阶级，存在着和无产阶级结成同盟的革命农民，存在着领导工农革命运动的列宁的党。由此俄国成了列宁主义的发源地，而俄国共产党的领袖列宁便成为列宁主义的创造者。
    列宁根据马克思主义的世界观，发展了无产阶级革命与无产阶级专政的方法和理论。斯大林同志指出列宁的方法是在与第二国际机会主义者进行坚决的斗争中锻炼出来的，是以革命的批判的方法来代替改良的和敷衍的方法。斯大林同志说：“列宁底方法不仅是把马克思底批判的革命的方法恢复了，不仅是把马克思底唯物辩证法恢复了，而且是把这个方法具体化和往前发展了。”
    列宁说：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”。马克思列宁主义革命的理论是唯一前进的科学理论。只有为这种理论武装起来的党，才能在复杂的环境中判明方向，并满怀信心地引导人民前进。斯大林同志在这里严厉地驳斥了自发“论”，指出这种论调“是在实际上否认……工人阶级党领导作用”。列宁的社会主义革命理论是对马克思主义创造性的发展。列宁从帝国主义政治经济发展不平衡的规律中，寻找出革命可能在一国获得胜利的原理；斯大林同志在和托洛茨基匪帮作斗争中，保卫并且发展了列宁的这一原理。在这本著作中，论述了革命胜利的国家，能够而且应当建成社会主义。根据这一思想，在“十月革命与俄国共产党人底策略”中，斯大林同志明确指出：工人阶级所领导的工农联盟，完全可以克服内部的各种困难和建成社会主义。而免除旧制度恢复的完全保障，只有经过
    “数国无产者们共同努力”才能做到。列宁斯大林关于社会主义革命的理论有力地武装了世界各国兄弟党。毛主席在一九二八年那样艰难的时期，满怀信心地论证了“红色政权为什么能够存在”（“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”），就是完全符合于列宁斯大林的这一原理的。毛主席分析当时中国的具体情况，得出了关于中国经济政治发展的极大不平衡性，以及由此规定了革命发展的极大不平衡性，革命有利用敌人弱点在农村建立长期的革命根据地的可能性等这一系列的结论。这一系列的结论，就给中国革命的胜利指出了一条明路。
    列宁说：“革命底基本问题是政权问题”。无产阶级革命的基本问题，就是以无产阶级专政这一工具，来保持和巩固夺得的政权。斯大林同志在这部著作中阐明了无产阶级专政的最重要的任务，并论证了这一任务的历史意义，发挥了列宁关于苏维埃政权是无产阶级专政的国家形式的思想，使这一思想成为系统的社会主义国家学说。后来在“论列宁主义底几个问题”一书中，斯大林同志又着重地阐述了列宁主义的主要之点是无产阶级专政问题，并规定了无产阶级专政的三个不可分割的基本方面，即“利用无产阶级政权来镇压剥削者，保卫国家，巩固与其他各国无产者间的联系，保证世界各国革命底发展和胜利”；“利用无产阶级政权来使被剥削劳动群众完全离开资产阶级，巩固无产阶级与这些群众的联盟，吸收这些群众来参加社会主义建设事业，保证无产阶级对这些群众实行国家领导”；“利用无产阶级政权来组织社会主义制度，消灭阶级，保证过渡到无阶级的社会，无国家的社会”。这不可分割的三个基本方面是苏维埃国家和全世界革命的发展和胜利的保证，是在社会主义建设中实现无产阶级领导并达到共产主义的保证。在联共（布）第十八次代表大会上，斯大林同志并指出在资本主义包围下进入共产主义时也仍然要保存国家的机关。这些原理对当前的革命实践具有非常重要的意义。马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的总结报告中说：“在社会主义革命已经在一个国家内取得胜利、而资本主义还统治着其他大部分国家的情况下，革命已经取得胜利的国度决不可削弱它的国家，而必须尽一切力量来巩固它的国家”。今天各人民民主国家也正是根据列宁斯大林的学说巩固着自己的政权。毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全体会议上说：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”新中国的一切伟大成就都是以这一有力武器为保证的。
    农民问题和民族问题是无产阶级专政问题的组成部分，是无产阶级为夺取政权和建设社会主义斗争中的同盟者问题。斯大林同志根据俄国三次革命的历史材料，指出列宁主义如何把工农联盟在工人阶级领导下组织成为一个强大的力量。并指出这个力量在无产阶级革命时期是不可战胜的，在社会主义建设时期也是不可战胜的。斯大林同志在本书中阐明了马克思列宁主义关于小农经济转变到大规模的集体农业的原理，指出列宁所指出的发展农业的道路是农民所愿意走的正确道路。后来苏联便根据列宁关于合作社的计划，实现了农业集体化。农民问题对于无产阶级革命，尤其是对于无产阶级所领导的殖民地半殖民地革命，是具有重大意义的。斯大林同志在另外的著作中，更明确地指出：殖民地与半殖民地问题，实质上是农民问题。并且特别指出：“中国农民卷入革命愈快愈彻底，中国反帝国主义的统一战线就愈有力和愈强大。”（“论中国革命底前途”）的确，农民问题是左右中国革命全局的问题。毛主席早在一九二七年就预见到农民运动“将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。一切帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，都将被他们葬入坟墓。”（“湖南农民运动考察报告”）在错误地估计农民这一点上，陈独秀路线和托洛茨基匪帮的主张是一致的。他们叛卖了这次革命以后便合成一伙。毛主席和党坚决地领导了农民革命。中国人民大革命胜利的历史事实，完全证明了斯大林和毛主席的英明和列宁主义的正确。
    民族问题和农民问题是密切相关的。二者都是无产阶级革命的后备力量的问题，都是无产阶级专政总问题的一部分。当然，我们也不能把二者混同。因为民族问题不仅是农民问题，而还包含着民族文化与民族国家等问题。列宁主义把民族问题和殖民地问题联结起来，“于是民族问题就由局部的和国内的问题变成了一般的和国际的问题，变成了依赖国和殖民地被压迫民族解脱帝国主义桎梏的世界问题”。这样就指出了民族问题可以在无产阶级革命的基础上和其相互联系中得到解决。列宁主义处理民族问题是以国际主义为原则的。斯大林同志不仅批判了民族主义者和改良主义者的错误看法，发展了列宁主义关于民族问题的理论，并且确定了民族政策，正确地解决了民族问题。马林科夫同志说：“斯大林同志是民族问题的最伟大的理论家，他在历史上第一次在一个多民族的大国范围内消灭了世世代代的民族的纷争。”（在莫斯科举行的斯大林追悼会上的讲话）苏联各族人民的团结和友谊的不可摧毁，是经过卫国战争的炮火考验过的。中国共产党的国际主义与民族平权的原则，表现在党的最低纲领——人民政协共同纲领上。对外：“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平。”对内：“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义，禁止民族间的敌视、压迫和分裂各民族团结的行为。”今天中国各民族的空前团结，是和马克思列宁主义—斯大林的学说分不开的。
     “战略和策略是领导无产阶级阶级斗争的科学”。战略是根据党的理论和纲领制定的。“战略就是规定无产阶级在革命某一阶段上的主要打击方向，制定革命力量（主要的和次要的后备力量）底相当布置计划，在革命这一阶段整个过程中为实现这个计划而奋斗。”而策略则是战略的一部分，是依从于战略并为实现战略计划而服务的。因此，策略就要随革命运动的高潮和低潮而变更。斯大林同志是伟大的革命战略家，斯大林同志所制定的战略与策略，充实了马克思列宁主义武库。列宁斯大林的战略和策略教导各国兄弟党要争取无产阶级、劳动群众，并团结在自己的周围，为和平民主、社会主义而斗争。以毛主席为领导的中国共产党，早就学得了苏联共产党的战斗经验，贯彻了以工农联盟为基础、以工人阶级为领导的正确路线，于是在各个革命阶段对其他阶级便有了明确的立场和态度。列宁主义关于正确使用后备力量的原理，在中国革命中具体表现为统一战线。在新民主主义革命中对资产阶级又联合又斗争的思想，是毛主席对列宁主义战略策略这一科学的重要贡献。关于中国革命斗争的形式，斯大林同志指出：“在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。”（“论中国革命底前途”）这一主要斗争形式贯串了中国革命的各个阶段。毛主席英明地运用了列宁主义的战略策略原则，是中国革命胜利的决定性因素。
    党是无产阶级的战斗的司令部，列宁主义的党是无产阶级夺取政权巩固政权和进行建设的领导力量。斯大林同志明确指出这个新型政党的特点：“党是工人阶级底先进部队”，“党是工人阶级底有组织的部队”，“党是无产阶级阶级组织底最高形式”，“党是无产阶级专政底工具”，“党是意志底统一、不容有派别组织存在”，“党是靠清除自身中间的机会主义分子而巩固起来的”。列宁斯大林所缔造的苏联共产党是具有这些特征的新型的党，苏联共产党是各国共产党的榜样。列宁斯大林的建党学说，对各兄弟党的建设与巩固，起了巨大的作用。中国共产党就是按照布尔什维克党缔造的。中国共产党党章总纲规定：“中国共产党，是中国工人阶级的先进的有组织的部队，是它的阶级组织的最高形式。中国共产党代表中国民族与中国人民的利益。它在现阶段为实现中国的新民主主义制度而奋斗。它的最终目的，是在中国实现共产主义制度。”刘少奇同志在“论党”这一文件中，充分地论证了我们的党是马克思列宁主义完全新式的政党。我们的党是在和阶级敌人作斗争中壮大起来的，是在和党内一切非无产阶级的思想政治倾向作斗争中巩固起来的。我们的党之所以是光荣的、伟大的、正确的，就因为我们的一切工作，都是以毛主席的马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的思想为指针的。
    在本书的最后部分是“工作作风”。“列宁主义是理论的和实践的学校，它能造成特别式样的党工作者和国家工作者”。列宁斯大林式的工作作风具有革命胆略与求实精神相结合的特征。这一特征正是战斗的、科学的方法和理论的具体体现，这一特征是衡量革命干部成熟程度的准绳。中国共产党以理论与实际一致的、紧密联系群众的、批评与自我批评的作风培养了干部，使大批的优秀干部掌握了行动的武器。毛主席曾用很大的力量和错误的思想作风作斗争。毛主席指出：“教条主义、经验主义，两者都是主观主义”（“整顿学风党风文风”），而这两种主观主义正是党内右倾和“左”倾机会主义的思想基础。我们的党在毛主席的英明领导下，切实地学习了苏联共产党的作风，使我们的党已经成为坚强的马克思列宁主义的党，它可以胜利地完成任何历史任务。
    斯大林同志光荣的一生，无愧为伟大的列宁事业的继承者。他以列宁主义武装了全世界共产党人和广大的进步群众，使人类解放事业突飞猛进，使我们的时代成为条条道路通向共产主义的时代。
    毛主席在“最伟大的友谊”中指出：“从列宁逝世以来，斯大林同志一直是世界共产主义运动的中心人物。我们围绕着他，不断地向他请教，不断地从他的著作中吸取思想的力量。”毛主席称“列宁主义基础”，“苏联共产党历史”，“苏联社会主义经济问题”这些不朽的著作为马克思列宁主义的百科全书，是百年来世界共产主义运动经验的综合。
    为了纪念斯大林同志，为了“沿着使列宁—斯大林的伟大事业获得完全胜利的道路前进”（马林科夫在莫斯科举行的斯大林追悼会上的讲话），我们就要在斗争中加紧学习马克思列宁主义，学习斯大林的学说，并把所学付诸实践。
