    Lingbi County Production and Disaster Relief Office Arbitrarily Wastes Labor During the Spring Plowing Season
    Letters from Yin Huaiyi and Liu Zheng, readers in Louzhuang District, Lingbi County, Anhui Province: The Lingbi County Production and Disaster Relief Office issues notices randomly during the spring plowing season, wasting labor, which not only affects spring plowing production but also creates adverse political effects.
    In March, the office notified our district to go to the county on March 25th to collect 30,000 jin of soybean cake. On the 25th, we sent 24 carts to the county to ask the responsible comrade of the office to write a transfer slip to collect it. The reply was: "The soybean cake is moldy, go to Yinji to get it!" It is more than 50 li from the county seat to Yinji. The cart drivers from our district only brought enough dry food and fodder for two meals and could not go, so they had to return. On March 28th, the office issued another notice requiring our district to go to the county seat on March 31st to collect 10,000 jin of small sorghum and 100,090 jin of large sorghum. Fearing another wasted trip, we inquired by phone five times in advance. They replied: "There will definitely be grain. We have spoken to the Grain Bureau, and they guarantee there will be grain, just come and get it." On March 31st, Comrade Wu Lianyuan from our district took 70 carts to the county seat. Unexpectedly, the responsible comrade of the Grain Bureau said that the Production and Disaster Relief Office had not notified them. We immediately questioned the Production and Disaster Relief Office, and they replied: "There is no grain now, come back another day." We had to return. Ninety-four carts made two wasted trips, wasting a total of 188 units of manpower and 282 units of animal power, which greatly affected spring plowing production, and the masses are very dissatisfied.

    灵璧县生产救灾办公室在春耕期间竟任意浪费民力
    安徽省灵璧县娄庄区读者殷怀义、刘政来信：灵璧县生产救灾办公室在春耕期间乱发通知，浪费民力，不但影响春耕生产，并造成不良政治影响。
    三月份该室通知我区在三月二十五日到县里去领取三万斤豆饼。到了二十五日，我们派大车二十四辆到县里找该室负责同志写拨条去领。答复是：“豆饼霉了，你们到尹集去拉吧！”从县城到尹集有五十多里路，我区去的赶车群众只带二顿干粮和草料，没法前去，只好回来。三月二十八日，该室又下通知要我区在三月三十一日到县城去领取一万斤小秫秫、十万零九千斤大秫秫。我们怕再白跑，事先在电话请示五次。他们答复是：“绝不会跑空。我们和粮食局说好了，保证有粮，走到就拉。”三十一日我区吴连元同志带了七十辆大车到县城。不料粮食局负责同志说是生产救灾办公室并未通知他们。当时我们就追问生产救灾办公室，他们答复说：“现在没粮了，改日再来拉吧。”我们只得回来。前后二次九十四辆大车白跑，共浪费人力一百八十八个工，畜力二百八十二个工，使春耕生产受到了很大影响，群众非常不满意。
