Reader's Letters Summary:

    Attention should be paid to the cover design and illustrations of books
    Ding Guichi, from a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote: I have two suggestions regarding the current publishing industry: First, the cover design of new books is not elaborate enough, and the cover art design has a tendency towards being formulaic, simple, and crude. I often see covers like this: the title is generally in Song typeface, with an additional photograph, or some common patterns that have little relation to the content of the book, or paper-cut window decorations. For example, the covers of "Lu Xun's Novels Collection," "Heroes of Lüliang" and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" in the People's Literature Series, as well as the covers of "Copper Wall and Iron Bastion" and "Firelight Ahead" in the recently published People's Literature Series, are all so flat and dull. The covers of some translated literary books are also like this. I think publishers, authors, and art workers should all pay attention to the ideological and artistic aspects of book cover design. We should paint and design diverse and artistically valuable covers based on the content of the book, paying as much attention to the publication of some books and periodicals as Mr. Lu Xun did.
    Second, more illustrations should be added to books. The illustrations in "How the Steel Was Tempered" are very good. However, some good literary books we have recently published do not have illustrations. I believe that "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," "The Hurricane," and the recently published "Biography of Du Fu" should have artists create more illustrations, especially for youth and children's publications, which should have even more illustrations.

### 应注意书籍的封面装帧和插画

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应注意书籍的封面装帧和插画
    中国人民解放军某部丁贵池来信说：我对目前的出版业有两点意见：一、目前新书的封面装帧不够讲究，封面画的设计有公式化、简单、粗劣的现象。我常看到这样的封面：书名大致是用宋体字，另加印一张照片，或加印一些与书的内容没有多大关系的常见的图案，或者是窗花。如“鲁迅小说集”、人民文学丛书中的“吕梁英雄传”“王贵与李香香”，以及最近出版的人民文学丛书“铜墙铁壁”“火光在前”等等一套书的封面，都是那么平板、乏味。有些翻译的文艺书籍的封面也是如此。我觉得出版者、作者以及美术工作者都应注意书的封面设计的思想性和艺术性。应该根据书的内容绘画和设计多彩多样的有艺术价值的封面。像鲁迅先生对待一些书刊的出版那样地注意。
    二、书中应多加些插画。像“钢铁是怎样炼成的”一书中的插画就很好。而我们最近出版的一些好的文艺书籍都没有插画。我认为如“太阳照在桑乾河上”“暴风骤雨”以及最近出版的“杜甫传”应该请美术家多作些插画，尤其是青年和儿童读物等等，都更应加上大量的插画。
