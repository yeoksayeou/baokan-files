    Central Election Committee's Instructions on Grassroots Election Work
    April 3, 1953
    (I)
    The Central People's Government Committee promulgated the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels of the People's Republic of China" on March 1st. According to the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee, "People's Congresses at all levels of the township, county, and province (city) should be convened this year, elected by the people through universal suffrage, and on this basis, the National People's Congress should be convened." Accordingly, people's governments and election committees at all levels should immediately begin election work.

    The election work of people's congresses in townships, towns, urban districts of cities, and cities without districts is the foundation of the election work of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels. Therefore, people's governments and election committees at the county and city levels and above must take guiding the elections of grassroots units as the focus of all election work.

    To do a good job in the elections of grassroots units nationwide, there must be full preparation, precise planning, and sufficient time. Therefore, it is determined that:

    (1) From May to October this year is the election time for grassroots units such as townships, towns, urban districts of cities, and cities without districts nationwide. All election work in grassroots units must be completed before the end of October.

    (2) County (city) People's Congresses should be convened in November this year or before November. The convening time of the provincial (city) People's Congresses will be determined separately.

    (3) The election time for urban districts of cities and cities without districts can be appropriately postponed to coincide with the convening time of their higher-level People's Congresses, but must be completed before the end of October.

    (4) Minority ethnic autonomous regions equivalent to the district level, and minority ethnic autonomous regions equivalent to the prefectural level or administrative office level, should complete their election work at least one month before the convening of the People's Congress at the next higher level.

    In this national grassroots election, the following requirements must be met on the basis of fully promoting democracy: (1) Do a good job in voter registration, and no citizen should be wrongly deprived of the solemn right to vote, nor should any reactionary element or landlord class element who has not changed his composition illegally steal the solemn right to vote; (2) Complete the national population census simultaneously with voter registration; (3) On the basis of in-depth mobilization, attract voters to consciously and enthusiastically participate in the election, so that the number of people participating in the election accounts for a high proportion of the total number of voters; (4) Combine the election work with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, so that all cadres can receive a profound education under the discrimination of the masses; (5) Through the election, remove those who violate laws and discipline and those who have committed serious mistakes and are extremely dissatisfied by the people from their jobs in various grassroots organizations, and select people loved by the masses and connected with the masses to work in such organizations. Only by carrying out the election work of grassroots units according to such requirements can we achieve the purpose of uniting the masses, educating cadres, strengthening the ties between the People's Government and the people, and further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

    The national grassroots election time is during the busy farming season, so the election work must be combined with production. All activities related to elections, such as propaganda, investigation and registration, voter group meetings, and election conferences, must seize the time, make use of the gaps, and avoid extravagance to ensure that agricultural time is not violated. Election activities in cities, factories, mines, government agencies, and schools should also pay attention to finding methods convenient for voters, so as not to delay production, work, and study.

    In grassroots elections, attention must be paid to election issues related to minority ethnic groups. In areas where minority ethnic groups live in concentrated communities, representatives commensurate with their status must be elected in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Election Law. In the election work, it is also necessary to earnestly respect the languages, scripts, customs, and habits of minority ethnic groups.

    The funds for grassroots elections shall be budgeted by the election committees of each province (city), and uniformly received and distributed after approval by the Central Election Committee.

    (II)
    The quality of grassroots election work depends on the leadership of counties and cities. The people's governments and election committees of counties and cities must formulate precise plans and make full preparations in accordance with the procedures for grassroots elections in order to ensure their smooth progress and completion on schedule. After the establishment of the county and city election committees, the following work should be carried out immediately:

    1. Conduct election law propaganda and explanation work among the people in a planned manner. The content of the propaganda, especially in rural areas, should be simple and clear, and mainly focused on the following three points: (1) Make all the masses understand the significance of the election and its close relationship with the people, make the voters realize the solemnity of the right to vote, and every voter should cherish this glorious right, so as to actively participate in the election; (2) Make the voters understand who has the right to vote and be elected, who does not have the right to vote and be elected, and call on everyone to pay attention to the voter registration work, and put forward opinions or file lawsuits on the announced voter list; (3) Make the voters understand who should be elected as representatives, call on everyone to conduct careful discussions and discriminations on the list of candidates, ruthlessly remove those they consider bad, and propose those they consider appropriate. In the propaganda, use the existing propaganda organizations and pay special attention to propaganda methods that are suitable for the masses, and avoid propaganda methods that waste people's power and delay production.

    2. Select a sufficient number of cadres based on the county or city, train them, and then send them to grassroots units such as townships and towns to serve as chairmen of the grassroots election committees and guide the grassroots election work. In addition, a large number of personnel must also be trained to serve as election technical workers.

    (1) The number of cadres responsible for leading grassroots elections, including personnel from the People's Courts, is calculated according to the standard of one cadre for every 2,000 people on average, and each cadre works for an average of three months. The number of personnel engaged in election technical work is calculated according to the standard of one worker for every 500 people on average, and each worker works for an average of one month.

    (2) The cadres and general staff members who guide the election shall be planned and transferred uniformly by the people's governments of each province (city).

    (3) The content of the training: for cadres who guide the election, they should study the "Election Law" and "Explanation on the Draft Election Law," especially the part related to grassroots elections; the "Central Election Committee's Instructions on Grassroots Election Work," "Central Election Committee's Answers to Several Questions on Voter Qualifications," and regulations on voter registration; and the "Instructions of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council on Conducting a National Population Census for the Preparation of Universal Suffrage." General staff members should focus on learning relevant business.

    (4) The time for concentrated document study should not be too long, about seven days for cadres guiding the election and about three days for general staff members. After studying the documents, it is best to divide all cadres and staff members into several teams, led by the responsible comrades of the county, to conduct typical trials in several grassroots units to gain practical experience, and then go to various places to guide the election work.

    3. The cadres sent to grassroots units such as townships and towns to guide the work can adopt the method of forming a work group of three to five people, with each work group leading one to three townships or towns, and each group implementing a division of labor and responsibility. This method ensures that each township and town has a dedicated person responsible, and can realize collective leadership, which is conducive to exchanging experiences and making fewer mistakes.

    4. Form and dispatch People's Courts that specialize in handling election-related litigation cases. Such People's Courts are dispatched by the People's Courts of counties and cities and are equivalent to circuit divisions of the People's Courts. The number of People's Courts shall be determined by counties and cities according to actual needs, one for each district or one for every two or three districts, based on the principle of facilitating the people to conduct litigation.

    5. Before dispatching the work groups, the county and city must do a good job of various preparations so that the election work can be started immediately after the work groups go down. These preparatory works are: (1) formulating the election plan and work schedule for the entire county and city; (2) holding necessary meetings to discuss the election work and explain the election policy; (3) determining the list of chairmen and members of the grassroots election committees; (4) determining the number of delegates for each grassroots congress, so as to divide the election areas according to the number of delegates; (5) printing and distributing population census and voter registration forms, voter certificates, and other election-related documents, and issuing the seals of the grassroots election committees; (6) regulations and distribution of election funds; (7) dispatch of the People's Courts; and other matters that should be prepared.

    (III)
    After the work groups sent by the superior election committees arrive at the grassroots units such as townships and towns, they should start work immediately according to the election procedures.

    1. Establish the election committee of the grassroots unit.

    (1) After the chairman and work group of the election committee sent by the superior arrive at the grassroots unit, the election committee should be established immediately.

    The seal of the grassroots unit election committee shall be issued by the superior authority to the chairman of the election committee, and shall be put into use when the organization is established and work begins.

    (2) The number of people and their appointments in the grassroots unit election committee shall be in accordance with Articles 35 and 36 of the Election Law, that is: the township and town election committee shall have one chairman and four to eight members, and the city-administered district and non-district city election committee shall have one chairman and six to twelve members. The election committee shall be appointed by the People's Government at the next higher level.

    (3) For the candidates for members, it is necessary to carefully select people who are upright, fair in handling affairs, able to contact the masses, and have certain working abilities. Women must participate. If there are a certain number of minority ethnic groups living in the territory, their representatives should be absorbed to participate.

    (4) After the grassroots unit election committee is established, it should immediately report its organizational division of labor, work procedures, and other important matters to the superior election committee.

    2. Divide the electoral districts according to the living conditions of the voters.

    (1) The electoral districts must be delimited before the population census and voter registration are carried out.

    (2) The electoral districts should be divided in combination with the population and natural conditions of residence. The population number of each electoral district should be generally adapted to the population number represented by each delegate in the local area, and there may be slight differences. For example, if the population number represented by each delegate is 100 people, when delimiting an electoral district that should elect two delegates, the population number of some electoral districts may be slightly more than 200 people, and the population number of some may be slightly less than 200 people.

    (3) Generally speaking, an electoral district that can produce two or three or more delegates is appropriate. In areas with sparse population and vast areas, one electoral district can elect one delegate, and in special cases, two electoral districts can jointly elect one delegate.

    (4) When dividing the electoral districts, the distance of the journey must be taken into account. The size of each electoral district is generally based on the principle that the diameter does not exceed 20 li, with exceptions for special circumstances.

    3. Conduct population census and voter registration.

    (1) Population census and voter registration are conducted simultaneously by setting up investigation and registration stations in electoral districts. In special circumstances, the method of investigation and registration by staff members visiting households one by one can also be adopted.

    (2) When registering, the head of the household or an adult familiar with the whole household can be the representative of the whole household and complete the population and voter registration at one time.

    (3) Each investigation and registration station has a voter qualification review group organized by the election committee, which is responsible for reviewing voter qualifications with the participation of voters in each electoral district during voter registration. For those who are generally recognized or determined by on-the-spot review to have the right to vote and be elected, a voter certificate shall be issued on the spot. For those who are generally recognized or determined by on-the-spot review to have no right to vote and be elected, they shall be explained on the spot, and no voter certificate shall be issued, and they shall be informed that if they disagree, they can appeal to the election committee. For those who cannot be determined on the spot whether they have the right to vote and be elected, the review group shall submit them to the election committee for review and determination.

    4. Announce the list of voters and the election date.

    (1) After all the voter registration work is completed, the election committee shall write the qualified voters into a list and post it for announcement.

    (2) After the voter qualifications are determined, each electoral district shall compile all voters into several voter groups according to their living conditions, and each group shall elect one group leader to carry out election work under the leadership of the election committee.

    (3) After the voter list is announced, each voter group should be notified to review and put forward opinions. The election committee and the People's Court shall accept the different opinions put forward on the voter list and the appeals regarding voter qualifications, and promptly review and deal with them seriously according to law.

    (4) The election committee shall determine the date and place of the election conference in each electoral district and announce it at the same time as the voter list.

    5. Propose candidates. The nomination of delegates to the People's Congress of the grassroots unit should begin after the voter list is announced.

    (1) According to Article 47 of the Election Law, the list of delegate candidates can be jointly or separately proposed by the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations (such as trade unions, farmers' associations, women's federations, youth federations, student federations, industrial and commercial federations, cooperatives, etc.), or can be jointly or separately proposed by several voters. In rural areas, the method of inviting representatives of the Communist Party organization and various people's organizations for consultation by the election committee can generally be adopted.

    (2) The nomination of delegate candidates should pay attention to the broad popular representation of the People's Congress, that is, attention should be paid to the fact that all classes and ethnic groups have delegate quotas commensurate with their status in the People's Congress, and special attention should be paid to the delegate quota of women.

    (3) The list of delegate candidates must be sent to each voter group for discussion 20 days before the election conference. The election committee shall summarize and study the results of the group discussions, and propose a formal list of delegate candidates according to the opinions expressed by the majority of voters, and announce it to the voters five days before the election conference.

    (4) The number of delegate candidates that the election committee submits to the election conference should generally be equal to the number of delegates to be elected, that is, how many delegates should be elected in this election area, how many delegate candidates should be proposed.

    (5) When announcing the formal list of delegate candidates, the election committee shall announce the date, time, and place of the election conference again.

    6. The election committee shall convene the election conference by electoral district according to the date, time, and place it announced.

    (1) The election conference must be attended by the representatives sent by the election committee before the meeting can be held, and the election can only be held if more than half of the voters are present.

    (2) Voters enter the election conference venue with their voter certificates.

    (3) The method of raising hands instead of voting is adopted for the election, and the method of anonymous voting can also be adopted when possible.

    (4) The election conference is presided over by the presidium of the election conference. The presidium is composed of three people: the representative sent by the election committee is the chairman of course, and serves as the executive chairman, and the other two are elected by the conference in accordance with the law.

    (5) The agenda of the election conference includes the following items:

    1. Reporting matters: First, report how many people there are in this electoral district, how many voters, and how many delegates should be elected; how many voters are present, whether the statutory number has been met, and if the statutory number has been met, announce the start of the meeting, and if the statutory number is not met, announce the rescheduling, and notify the date, time, and place of the next meeting. Secondly, report that according to Article 54 of the Election Law, the voters present should elect two chairmen and one representative sent by the election committee to form the presidium to preside over the election conference. Again, announce that the purpose of the election conference is to elect delegates to the People's Congress of this grassroots unit.

    2. Announce the list of delegate candidates. When announcing the list, the chairman should explain who proposed the candidates.

    3. Introduce the vote counters. The chairman should read Article 59 of the "Election Law," which states that "Delegate candidates to the People's Congresses at all levels can only be elected when they have obtained more than half of the votes of the voters or delegates present. If the candidate does not receive more than half of the votes, another election should be held."

    4. Conduct election, count votes, and check the number of people.

    5. The presidium announces the results of the election and announces the list of elected delegates.

    6. Other.

    7. Announce the adjournment.

    7. After the delegate is elected, the grassroots election committee shall issue the certificate of election.

    8. After electing the delegates, the grassroots election committee shall immediately report the total number of voters in the electoral district, the number of voters participating in the voter conference, and the election results to the superior election committee.

    (IV)
    After the election of the delegates to the People's Congress of the grassroots unit is completed, the first People's Congress of the grassroots unit should be convened regularly. After the presidium of the People's Congress is elected, the task of the election committee is completed, and the congress should be presided over by the presidium.

    The main agenda of the first People's Congress of the grassroots unit is:

    (1) Work report and discussion of the previous People's Government; (2) Election of the People's Government of this administrative unit.

    Before the national constitution is formulated, the grassroots People's Government can conduct elections according to the original political power organizational form, that is, the one with the township chief system will still elect the township chief, and the one with the committee system will still elect the committee.

    The election of delegates to the People's Congress at the next higher level by the grassroots People's Congress can only be carried out after the election plan of the People's Congress at the next higher level is determined. Therefore, this work can be carried out at the first People's Congress, or it can be carried out at another People's Congress.

    (V)
    After the grassroots election committee completes its task, it shall handle the following concluding work:

    (1) Submit a summary report on the election work to the superior People's Government and election committee;

    (2) Settle accounts, submit a report on income and expenditure of funds to the superior People's Government and election committee, and announce it to the voters;

    (3) Sort out all documents, list them, and submit them to the superior People's Government for safekeeping together with the seal.

    After all the above work is completed, the election committee will be revoked.

    中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示
    一九五三年四月三日
    （一）
    中央人民政府委员会已于三月一日公布了“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”。按照中央人民政府委员会的决议，应在今年内“召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会。”据此，各级人民政府及各级选举委员会应即开始进行选举工作。
    乡、镇、市辖区和不设区的市人民代表大会的选举工作，是全国及地方各级人民代表大会选举工作的基础。因此，县、市以上各级人民政府和各级选举委员会必须把指导基层单位的选举，作为全部选举工作的重点。
    办好全国基层单位的选举工作，要有充分的准备、精密的计划和足够的时间。因此确定：
    （一）从今年五月到十月，为全国乡、镇、市辖区和不设区的市等基层单位的选举时间。所有基层单位的选举工作，必须于十月底以前全部完成。
    （二）县（市）人民代表大会应在今年十一月间或在十一月以前召开。省（市）人民代表大会召开时间另行规定。
    （三）市辖区和不设区的市的选举时间，可以适当推迟，使与其上一级人民代表大会召开时间相衔接，但必须在十月底以前进行完毕。
    （四）等于区级的少数民族自治区，和等于专区级或行署级的少数民族自治区，其选举工作，应比上一级人民代表大会之召开至少早一个月进行完毕。
    在这次全国的基层选举中，必须在充分发扬民主的基础上，实现下列的要求：（一）做好选民登记工作，不能让一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利，也不能让一个反动分子或未经改变成份的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的选举权利；（二）与选民登记同时，完成全国的人口调查；（三）在深入动员的基础上，吸引选民自觉地热烈地参加选举，使参加选举的人数占全体选民数的很高的比例；（四）把选举工作与反官僚主义、反命令主义和反违法乱纪的斗争结合起来，使所有干部都能在群众的鉴别下受到一次深刻的教育；（五）经过选举把那些违法乱纪分子和犯有严重错误而为人民群众所极不满意的分子从各种基层组织的工作岗位上剔除出去，把群众所爱戴的联系群众的人选到这种组织的工作岗位上来。只有根据这样的要求去进行基层单位的选举工作，才能达到团结群众、教育干部、加强人民政府与人民群众的联系和进一步地巩固人民民主专政的目的。
    全国基层选举时间，正值农忙季节，所以选举工作必须结合生产去进行。所有有关选举的宣传、调查登记、选民小组会议及选举大会等一系列的活动，都须抓紧时间，利用空隙，切忌铺张，保证不违农时。城市、厂矿、机关、学校的选举活动，亦应注意讲求便利选民的方法，以期不误生产、工作和学习。
    在基层选举中，必须注意有关少数民族的选举问题。凡有少数民族聚居的地方，都须按照选举法规定的原则，选出与其地位相当的代表。在选举工作中，还须切实尊重少数民族的语言文字和风俗习惯。
    基层选举的经费，由各省（市）选举委员会编制预算，经中央选举委员会批准，统一领发。
    （二）
    基层选举工作的好坏，决定于县、市的领导。县、市人民政府及其选举委员会，必须按照基层选举的程序，订出精确的计划，作好充分的准备，才能保证其顺利进行与如期完成。县、市选举委员会成立之后，应即进行下列工作：
    一、应有计划地在人民群众中，进行选举法的宣传解释工作。宣传的内容，特别在乡村中，要简单明了，主要集中于下列三点，即：（1）使所有群众认识选举的意义及与人民群众的切身关系，使选民认识选举权利的庄严性，每个选民都应珍贵这个光荣的权利，从而积极地参加选举；（2）使选民懂得那些人有选举权和被选举权，那些人没有选举权和被选举权，号召大家关心选民登记工作，并对公布的选民名单提出意见或提出诉讼；（3）使选民懂得应该选什么人当代表，号召大家对候选人名单进行慎重的讨论和鉴别，毫不容情地去掉那些自己认为不好的人，提出自己认为适当的人。在宣传中，应利用现有的各种宣传组织，特别注意讲求适应群众的宣传方法，避免采用浪费民力耽误生产的宣传方法。
    二、应以县或市为单位，选调足够数目的干部，经过训练之后，派至乡、镇等基层单位，担任基层选举委员会的主席和指导基层选举的工作。此外，还须训练大量人员，担任选举的技术工作。
    （一）担任领导基层选举工作的干部数目，包括人民法庭的人员在内，按平均每两千人口有一个干部，每一干部平均工作三个月的标准计算。担任选举技术工作的人员数目，按平均每五百人口有一个工作人员，每一工作人员平均工作一个月的标准计算。
    （二）指导选举的干部及一般工作人员，由各省（市）人民政府统一计划和抽调。
    （三）训练的内容：对指导选举的干部，应学习“选举法”及“关于选举法草案的说明”，尤其是其中有关基层选举的部份；“中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示”，“中央选举委员会关于选民资格若干问题的解答”及有关选民登记的规定，和“中央人民政府政务院为准备普选进行全国人口调查登记的指示”。对一般工作人员，应着重于有关业务的学习。
    （四）集中学习文件的时间不宜过长，指导选举的干部以七天左右为宜，一般工作人员以三天左右为宜。文件学习之后，最好将所有干部和工作人员，分成若干队，由县的负责同志率领，到若干基层单位，进行典型试办，取得实际经验，而后分别到各地指导选举工作。
    三、派至乡、镇等基层单位指导工作的干部，可采取以三人至五人为一工作组，每一工作组领导一个到三个乡、镇，各个组内又实行分工负责的办法。这个办法既使每一乡、镇都有专人负责，又能实现集体领导，利于交流经验和少犯错误。
    四、组成并派出专门受理有关选举的诉讼案件的人民法庭，这种人民法庭是由县、市人民法院派出的，相当于人民法院的巡回分庭。人民法庭的数目，由县、市按实际需要去规定，可以一个区一个，也可以两三个区一个，以便利于人民进行诉讼为原则。
    五、县、市在分派工作组之前，必须做好各项准备工作，以便于工作组下去之后，能够立刻开始选举工作。这些准备工作是：（1）制定全县、市的选举计划和工作日程；（2）召开必要的会议讨论选举工作，交代选举政策；（3）确定基层选举委员会主席及委员的名单；（4）确定各基层代表大会的名额，以便根据名额划分选举区域；（5）印发人口调查与选民登记表册、选民证及其他有关选举的文件，颁发基层选举委员会的印章；（6）选举经费的规定与发给；（7）人民法庭的派出；以及其他应行准备的事宜。
    （三）
    上级选举委员会所派指导选举的工作组到达乡、镇等基层单位之后，应即按照选举程序，开始工作。
    一、建立基层单位的选举委员会。
    （一）基层单位在上级所派的选举委员会主席和工作组到达后，立即建立选举委员会。
    基层单位选举委员会的印章，由上级机关发交选举委员会主席，于建立组织、开始工作时启用。
    （二）基层单位选举委员会的人数及其任命，应依选举法第三十五、三十六两条的规定，即：乡、镇选举委员会设主席一人、委员四人至八人，市辖区和不设区的市选举委员会设主席一人、委员六人至十二人。选举委员会由上一级人民政府任命。
    （三）对于委员的人选，必须慎重选择为人正派、办事公道、能联系群众且有一定办事能力的人充任。要有妇女参加。境内有一定数量的少数民族聚居的，应吸收其代表人物参加。
    （四）基层单位选举委员会成立后，应将其组织分工、工作程序及其他有关的重要事项，立即报告上级选举委员会。
    二、按照选民的居住情况划分选区。
    （一）选区必须在进行人口调查和选民登记以前划定。
    （二）选区要结合人口与居住的自然条件划分。每一选区的人口数应与当地每一代表所应代表的人口数大体相适应，可略有差别，例如，每一代表所代表的人口数为一百人，则划定应选两个代表的选举区时，有的选区的人口数可略多于二百人，有的也可略少于二百人。
    （三）一般的选区，以能产生两三个或三个以上代表为适当。人口稀散、地区辽阔之处，可以一个选区选出一个代表，特殊的还可以两个选区合选一个代表。
    （四）划分选区时，须照顾路程的远近。每一选区的大小，一般以直径不超过二十华里为原则，特殊情形者例外。
    三、举办人口调查和选民登记。
    （一）人口调查和选民登记，按选区设立调查登记站，同时进行。在特殊情况下，也可采用由工作人员逐户访问进行调查登记的办法。
    （二）办理登记时，得由户主或熟悉全户情况的成年人一人为其全户的代表，一次办妥人口和选民两项登记。
    （三）调查登记站各有一个选举委员会所组织的选民资格审查小组，在各该选区的选民参加之下，在选民登记同时，负责审查选民资格。凡属公认或经当场评议确定其有选举权和被选举权的，当场填发选民证。凡属公认或经当场评议确定其无选举权和被选举权的，则予当场说明，不发选民证，并告以如不同意，可向选举委员会提出申诉。凡属当场不能确定其有无选举权和被选举权的，则由审查小组提到选举委员会审查确定。
    四、公布选民名单和选举日期。
    （一）选民登记工作全部完毕后，即由选举委员会将审查合格的选民，写成名单，张贴公布。
    （二）选民资格确定后，各选区应将所有选民，按照居住情况，编成若干选民小组，各推小组长一人，在选举委员会领导下进行选举工作。
    （三）选民名单公布后，即应通知各选民小组进行审查和提出意见。对于选民名单所提出的不同意见，以及有关选民资格的申诉，选举委员会和人民法庭应予接受，迅即依法审查，严肃处理。
    （四）选举委员会应确定各选区的选举大会的日期和地点，与选民名单同时公布。
    五、提出候选人。基层单位人民代表大会的代表候选人，应在选民名单公布后，开始提名。
    （一）代表候选人的名单，依选举法第四十七条规定，可由中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体（如工会、农民协会、妇女联合会、青年联合会、学生联合会、工商业联合会、合作社等）联合或单独提出，亦可由选民联合若干人或单独提出。在乡村，一般可采取由选举委员会邀集共产党组织及各人民团体的代表进行协商的办法。
    （二）代表候选人的提名，应注意到人民代表大会的广泛的人民代表性，即应注意到各阶层各民族都在人民代表大会中有与其地位相当的代表名额，尤其要注意到妇女的代表名额。
    （三）代表候选人名单须在选举大会二十天以前发交各选民小组讨论。选举委员会应根据小组讨论的结果，汇总研究，按照最多数选民所表示的意见，提出代表候选人的正式名单，于选举大会五天以前向选民公布。
    （四）选举委员会提到选举大会上的代表候选人的名额，一般应与当选代表人数相等，即这个选举区域应选几个代表，就提出几个代表候选人。
    （五）选举委员会应在公布代表候选人正式名单时，再次公布选举大会的日期、时间和地点。
    六、选举委员会依其公布的日期、时间和地点，按选区召开选举大会。
    （一）选举大会必须有选举委员会所派的代表出席始能开会，必须有选民过半数的出席始能选举。
    （二）选民凭选民证进入选举大会会场。
    （三）采用以举手代投票方法进行选举，可能时亦得采用无记名投票方法进行选举。
    （四）选举大会由选举大会主席团主持。主席团由三人组成：选举委员会所派的代表为当然主席，并担任执行主席，其余二人依法由大会推选。
    （五）选举大会的议程包括下列各项：
    1、报告事项：首先报告本选区共有多少人口，多少选民，应选代表几人；到会的选民多少，是否已足法定人数，已足法定人数就宣布开会，不足法定人数就宣布改期，并通知下次开会的日期、时间和地点。其次报告应依选举法第五十四条规定，由到会选民推举主席二人，与选举委员会所派的代表一人组成主席团，主持选举大会。再次宣布选举大会的目的是选举本基层单位人民代表大会的代表。
    2、宣布代表候选人的名单。主席在宣布名单时，应说明候选人是谁提出的。
    3、推出计票人员。主席应宣读“选举法”第五十九条“各级人民代表大会代表候选人获得出席选民或代表半数以上选票时，始得当选。如候选人所获选票不足半数时，应另行选举。”的规定。
    4、进行选举、计票、核对人数。
    5、主席团宣布选举的结果，宣布当选代表名单。
    6、其他。
    7、宣布散会。
    七、代表选出后，由基层选举委员会发给当选证书。
    八、基层选举委员会于选出代表后，应将本选区选民总数、参加选民大会的选民人数、以及选举结果，立即报告上级选举委员会。
    （四）
    基层单位人民代表大会代表选举完毕后，应定期召集本基层单位的第一次人民代表大会。在人民代表大会主席团选出后，选举委员会的任务即告完毕，代表大会即应由主席团主持进行。
    基层单位第一次人民代表大会的主要议程为：
    （一）上届人民政府的工作报告和讨论；（二）选举本行政单位的人民政府。
    基层人民政府在国家宪法尚未制定以前，可按原有的政权组织形式进行选举，即原为乡长制的仍然选举乡长，原为委员会制的仍然选举委员会。
    基层人民代表大会选举出席上一级人民代表大会代表的工作，应在上级人民代表大会选举计划确定后才能进行。所以这件工作，可以在第一次人民代表大会上进行，亦可以在另一次人民代表大会上进行。
    （伍）
    基层选举委员会完成任务后，应办理如下的结束工作：
    （一）向上级人民政府和选举委员会作选举工作总结报告；
    （二）清算账目，向上级人民政府和选举委员会作经费收支报告，并向选民公布；
    （三）清理一切文件，并列出清单，连同印章一齐缴呈上一级人民政府封存。
    上项工作全部完成后，选举委员会即行撤销。
