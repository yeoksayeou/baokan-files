Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 31st. The "Democratic Korea" newspaper, the organ of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, published an editorial on March 30th, firmly supporting the letter from Marshal Kim Il Sung and General Peng Dehuai to Clark on the 28th, and demanding that the U.S. side immediately show sincerity in resuming the Korean armistice negotiations. The editorial pointed out: The letter from Marshal Kim Il Sung and General Peng Dehuai to Clark once again clearly shows our side's consistent stance and attitude on peacefully resolving the Korean issue and striving for a swift armistice negotiation. It also shows that the proposal put forward by our side in the reply is fundamentally different from the U.S. side's opinion, which is limited to the prior repatriation of seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war without considering the resumption of armistice negotiations at all. Everyone knows that Article 53 of the already agreed-upon draft armistice agreement stipulates the priority repatriation of seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war. It is precisely because the U.S. side deliberately interrupted the armistice negotiations that this agreement has not been realized.

The editorial emphasized: Today, the issue has become clearer than ever. If the U.S. side still has a shred of desire for peace, then it must immediately agree to our side's proposal to resume armistice negotiations, and must show sincerity and effort in reaching a fair and reasonable agreement on the issue of prisoners of war. This is the only path to realizing the Korean armistice. Conversely, if the U.S. side does not learn a lesson from the unprecedented military defeat they have suffered on the Korean battlefield, and wants to carry out new adventurous actions, then the U.S. side will further expose itself as an enemy of world peace, and the U.S. aggressor troops will inevitably suffer devastating blows from the Korean and Chinese People's Armies.

The editorial pointed out: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have further consolidated their defensive positions in the past defensive warfare stage; they have been further strengthened not only in quantity but also in quality and technology. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies are fully prepared to crush any mad adventures by the enemy and win the final victory.

    “民主朝鲜”报发表社论
    坚决支持金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的建议
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府机关报“民主朝鲜”报在三月三十日发表社论，坚决支持金日成元帅和彭德怀将军在二十八日给克拉克的回信，并要求美方立即对恢复朝鲜停战谈判表示诚意。社论指出：金日成元帅和彭德怀将军给克拉克的回信，再一次明确地表明我方和平解决朝鲜问题的主张和争取迅速达成停战谈判的立场与态度，是始终如一的。同时也说明：我方在回信中所提出的建议，与美方的意见只限于先行遣返重病重伤战俘而完全没有考虑恢复停战谈判的问题，是根本不同的。大家都知道，早已达成协议的停战协定草案的第五十三项，就规定着优先遣返重病重伤战俘。正是因为美方故意地中断了停战谈判，所以这项协议一直没有实现。
    社论强调说：到了今天，问题已显得最清楚不过了。如果美方对和平还有一点愿望的话，那么就必须即时同意我方关于恢复停战谈判的提议，并必须对公平合理地达成战俘问题的协议表示诚意和努力。这是实现朝鲜停战的唯一道路。与此相反，如果美方不从他们在朝鲜战场上所遭到的空前的军事惨败中吸取教训，而要进行新的冒险行动的话，那么，美方就将进一步暴露了自己是世界和平的敌人，而且美国侵略军必将遭到朝中人民军队歼灭性的打击。
    社论指出：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在过去的防御作战阶段中，已进一步巩固了自己的防御阵地；不但在数量上，而且在质量上与技术上也有了进一步的加强。朝中人民军队已有了充分的准备，可以粉碎敌人任何疯狂的冒险行动，争取最后胜利。
