Sending Large Numbers of Cadres from Party and Government Organs in Various Regions to the Countryside to Inspect Spring Plowing Work
Helping District and Township Cadres Correct Thoughts of Neglecting Production

In order to ensure that the agricultural season is not missed and to do a good job in spring plowing production, many responsible cadres in various regions have led inspection teams to go deep into the countryside to inspect the preparation for spring plowing and solve various problems in spring plowing production in a timely manner. This is an important method of truly regarding spring plowing production as the overriding central task.

Cai Ziwei, Deputy Director of the Northwest Finance and Economics Committee and Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, Feng Shixiu, Deputy Director, and Guan Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, have led a large number of cadres to the countryside in batches in late March. At the same time, the People's Governments of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces have also drawn more than 500 cadres to go to the countryside to inspect spring plowing work. This inspection will first understand the current situation of spring plowing production in various parts of the Northwest and help farmers of all ethnic groups overcome difficulties in spring plowing production. At the same time, it is necessary to check the problems in the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places. In addition, it is necessary to check the cotton production reduction problem in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area in Shaanxi, the seed mixing problem in the areas with severe wheat stripe rust in Hexi, Gansu Province, the problem of organizing production increase competitions in Qinghai Province, and the problem of popularizing new agricultural tools in Ningxia Province. It was also decided to send technical cadres to effectively assist local farmers in solving production problems.

Xie Fumin, Deputy Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, He Yiran, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Liao Yuan, Deputy Director of the Finance Committee of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, Xie Hechou, Vice Chairman of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government, Luo Ming, Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Government, and others have gone to Yongning, Pingle, Guilin, Yishan, Rongxian and other special districts to inspect work. At present, leading cadres in some counties and districts in Guangxi Province have not placed the leadership of spring plowing production in the most important position. They mistakenly believe that "production is constant and we can lead production after finishing the shock tasks." These responsible cadres who go to the countryside to inspect work should help county and district cadres thoroughly correct this erroneous thinking.

Yang Xinpei, Secretary of the Taizhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province, led an inspection team to Zeguo District, Wenling County last month to inspect work. He convened a forum with mutual aid team leaders and district and township cadres from Shanbei Township and Zeguo Town in the district to check the preparation for spring plowing item by item. He found that the material preparation and organizational preparation were very poor. The County Party Secretary had reported to the Prefectural Committee that the problem of the lack of seeds had been solved. However, according to the inspection, there were 144 households lacking seeds in Shanbei Township and Zeguo Town in Zeguo District. If these problems are not addressed with urgent measures, they will inevitably affect timely spring plowing and sowing. Yang Xinpei analyzed the reasons for this situation, criticized the cadres' complacency and paralysis, actively helped the district and township cadres mobilize the masses to quickly solve these problems, and instructed the county party committees of various counties on the spot by telephone to immediately change this bureaucratic style, conduct in-depth inspections of spring plowing preparations, and effectively help farmers solve various difficult problems in spring plowing production.

    把各地党政机关派大批干部下乡检查春耕工作
    帮助区乡干部纠正忽视生产的思想
    为了保证不误农时，作好春耕生产工作，各地许多负责干部分别率领检查组，深入农村检查春耕准备情况，及时解决春耕生产中的各种问题。这是真正把春耕生产作为压倒一切的中心任务的重要方法。
    西北财政经济委员会副主任兼农林局长蔡子伟、副局长冯士休、水利局副局长关文启率领的大批干部，已在三月下旬分批下乡。与此同时，陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏、新疆等省人民政府也已抽调干部五百多人下乡检查春耕工作。这次检查中，首先是了解目前西北各地春耕生产的情况，并帮助各族农民克服春耕生产中的困难。同时要检查各地互助合作运动发展中的问题。此外，还要检查陕西泾惠渠灌溉区的棉花减产问题，甘肃省河西春麦黄锈病严重地区的拌种问题，青海省组织增产竞赛问题，宁夏省推广新式农具问题。并决定派出技术干部，切实协助当地农民解决生产中的问题。
    中共广西省委副书记谢扶民、省委宣传部长贺亦然、广西省人民政府财委副主任廖原、桂西僮族自治区人民政府副主席谢鹤筹、省人民政府秘书长骆明等，已於日前分赴邕宁、平乐、桂林、宜山、容县等专区检查工作。目前广西省有些县区的领导干部还没有把领导春耕生产放在头等重要的地位。他们错误地认为“生产是经常的，可以搞完突击任务，再来领导生产。”这些下乡检查工作的负责干部，应该帮助县区干部彻底纠正这种错误思想。
    中共浙江台州地委书记杨心培于上月带领检查组赴温岭县泽国区检查工作。他召集了该区山北乡、泽国镇的互助组长与区乡干部进行座谈，逐项检查春耕准备工作，发现各项物质准备与组织准备都做得很差，而该县县委书记曾向地委报告说：缺乏种籽的问题已解决了。但据检查：泽国区的山北乡、泽国镇，就有一百四十四户缺乏种籽。这些问题如果再不采取紧急措施加以解决，势必影响适时春耕播种。杨心培分析了产生这一情况的原因，批判了干部的自满麻痹思想，积极帮助该区区乡干部发动群众迅速解决这些问题，并就地用电话指示各县县委，立即转变这种官僚主义作风，深入检查春耕准备工作，切实帮助农民解决春耕生产中的各项困难问题。
