    East China Construction Engineering Company Mobilizes Employees to Inspect Waste in Construction
    [This Newspaper] The East China Construction Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry mobilized over 10,000 employees to conduct a large-scale inspection of projects completed in 1952. This revealed many instances of waste and educated all employees. It created favorable conditions for implementing the economic accounting system, strengthening construction management, perfecting the responsibility system, and improving the quality of new construction projects this year.
    The construction inspection by the East China Construction Engineering Company was carried out during the winter training period. Leading cadres put forward the slogan "Everyone participates, find loopholes, calculate waste, compare quality, raise questions." Over 10,000 employees throughout the company launched a large-scale inspection at over thirty construction sites. The inspection methods included holding worker symposiums at construction sites and organizing dedicated personnel to inspect project quality with a focus. At the beginning of the movement, some people had inconsistent understandings. Some workers said, "The matter is already in the past, why inspect it?" "We don't know how to do this, let the accounting department do it!" Staff members had greater concerns, fearing that revealing problems would lead to accountability and implicate themselves. Therefore, at the beginning, leading cadres repeatedly explained to all employees that the purpose of the inspection was to learn from experience and lessons, not to assign blame. At the same time, the Hudong Engineering Office, the Shanghai Engineering Office, and others also organized work teams to go deep into key construction sites to provide specific guidance. In this way, the inspection work gradually unfolded. Employees' morale rose, and many activists among the workers had long held opinions on many issues in their work, but had been afraid to raise them in the past. For example, workers in the second bricklaying team at the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 2 Plant construction site had written down eighteen suggestions long ago, and only took them out when the work team came down this time. Workers at the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory No. 2 Plant construction site raised 797 suggestions in discussions. Staff and technical personnel also actively participated in collecting materials. According to incomplete statistics from four engineering offices, employees raised a total of 2,796 opinions on construction management, project quality, and other aspects.
    During this construction inspection, a large number of facts were revealed about past irresponsibility in construction management, poor project quality, and serious waste. For example, there was a serious lack of planning in construction management. Almost all construction sites lacked thorough plans for material supply, tool supply, labor allocation, workload for each period, and construction procedures, which often led to chaotic work and caused huge waste. For example, due to the untimely supply of materials, the common practice on construction sites was to use large materials for small purposes and long materials for short purposes. At the Tongji University construction site, large materials were used for small purposes, sawing off over a thousand long pieces of wood, leaving 50,000 catties of waste wood that could only be used for firewood. The Minhang construction site also wasted wood worth 80 million yuan because of using large materials for small purposes. The loss of manpower caused by the allocation of labor without regard to actual conditions was also common and serious on construction sites. For example, the Shanghai Public Transport Bus Company construction site once needed bricklayers but instead transferred thirty-nine workers from other trades, resulting in these thirty-nine people having nothing to do but knock on concrete. In the inspection of project quality, many projects were found to have the phenomenon of "sinking, cracking, tilting, and leaking," with the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital (i.e., Chengzhong Sanatorium) being the most serious. The reason for the poor quality of many projects was the workers' mistaken so-called "saving," using materials that did not meet specifications and failing to ensure project quality. For example, the platform should have been covered with felt and asphalt, but the failure to use these materials eventually led to cracks and leaks. During construction, they simply sought speed and did not follow the regulations. For example, wood for decoration was used without being dried, resulting in later cracking. Yellow sand was not cleaned before pouring cement, causing the yellow sand to lose its adhesion to the cement, resulting in cracks, and so on. Workers also raised opinions about the neglect of worker safety and hygiene by construction site leaders, the lack of cultural activities on construction sites, and the lack of attention to workers' living welfare. The revelation of a large number of problems shocked both leading cadres and the majority of employees. For example, workers at the Minhang Engineering Office calculated that their various waste losses alone amounted to more than 210 million yuan, which could buy 1,500 dan of rice, enough to feed ten people for eighteen years and four months. According to extremely incomplete statistics from the four engineering offices, various waste losses totaled more than 1.9 billion yuan, and more importantly, caused irreparable damage to the country's basic construction projects. The workers said painfully: "This year is the first year of the country's Five-Year Construction Plan. If we don't overcome these shortcomings through this inspection and speed up, how much loss will we cause to the country!"
    The construction inspection also summarized past work on promoting advanced working methods and rationalization proposals. For example, the Shanghai Engineering Office focused on the Chu Adi group to summarize the experience of implementing the double-handed slurry squeezing method, and the experience of promoting the assembly line operation method in carpentry and the use of new tools in plastering. The results proved that the new working methods greatly improved work efficiency and quality, thus saving a lot of money. For example, the implementation of the double-handed slurry squeezing method at the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory No. 2 Plant construction site increased work efficiency by three times. The Chu Adi group saved more than 9.6 million yuan in expenses during the thirty-two working days in which it implemented the new working method. The construction inspection also inspected the many creations and rationalization proposals made by employees in the past. The results of the inspection also proved that most of the workers' creations and rationalization proposals had played a significant role in the work. For example, the ditch-lining tool created by worker Wang Chenghao's group increased work efficiency fivefold after being put into use. During the inspection, workers sharply criticized the bureaucratic practices of construction site leaders who ignored workers' creative activities. There were no specialized organizations or personnel responsible for handling rationalization proposals at each construction site, no reward and punishment system, and no enthusiastic support for workers' creations and improvements, even ignoring them, which reduced workers' enthusiasm.
    The construction inspection provided practical and effective education to the majority of employees and boosted workers' enthusiasm for production. In the final stage of the inspection, many construction sites specifically convened "plug the loopholes" meetings, and workers actively put forward specific suggestions for improving work with a master's attitude. A mixed group at the Minhang Engineering Office put forward forty improvement suggestions. Workers generally demanded frequent production meetings to exchange experiences, and requested to learn technology and advanced working methods. The bricklaying team at the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 2 Plant construction site proposed: "In the past, we did not use advanced working methods to operate, and production was slow. This is a loss to the country. In the future, we must learn advanced working methods." Everyone actively thought of ways to reduce waste and improve work quality. After the construction inspection, mud workers Wang Yongli and Feng Musheng at the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory No. 2 Plant construction site improved their enthusiasm for production and recently put forward a rationalization proposal of "platform plastering," which immediately received the attention and support of leading cadres. After implementation, it proved to be both labor-saving and material-saving, as well as beautiful and generous. One hundred and thirty-five square meters of "platform" saved thirty bags of cement and one hundred and fifty-two man-days, worth about more than 2 million yuan. If this method is widely promoted, it can save a lot of funds. After the construction inspection, the relationship between construction site leaders and employees improved, and the unity between employees was also strengthened. The painters, who used to be very conservative in their techniques, also proposed to discuss and study with everyone in the future to improve the quality of paint and improve work quality. Many construction sites have seen new atmospheres.
    Now, the East China Construction Engineering Company has, based on the problems found in this inspection, drafted a set of responsibility systems for various construction sites and distributed them to each engineering office for discussion and supplementation, preparing to establish various systems from top to bottom to overcome the past situation of irresponsibility in work and do a good job in construction.

    华东建筑工程公司发动职工群众
    检查施工中的浪费现象
    【本报讯】第一机械工业部华东建筑工程公司，发动全体职工一万余人，对一九五二年施工的工程进行了一次大规模的检查，揭发了许多浪费现象，教育了全体职工，为今后贯彻经济核算制和加强施工管理、健全责任制、提高今年新建工程的质量，创造了良好的条件。
    华东建筑工程公司的施工检查是在冬训期间进行的。领导干部提出了“大家动手，找漏洞，算浪费，比质量，提问题”的口号，全公司一万余职工在三十余个工地上展开了大规模的检查。检查的方法是按工地召开工人座谈会以及有重点地组织专人检查工程质量。运动开始时，一部分群众认识还不一致。有的工人说：“事情已过去了，还检查它做什么！”“这种事我们不会，你们账房间去做吧！”职员中顾虑较大，他们害怕揭发出问题后追究责任，连累自己。因此一开始领导干部便向全体职工反复说明检查的目的在于吸取经验教训，不在于追究责任。同时，沪东工程处、上海工程处等还组织了工作组，深入到重点工地去具体指导。这样，检查工作便逐渐开展了。职工们情绪日益高涨，工人中有许多积极分子对于工作中的许多问题是早有意见的，但过去不敢提，如上海钢铁公司第二厂工地泥工第二组的工人很早就写下了十八条意见，在这次工作组下来时才拿了出来。上海电线二厂工地工人们在讨论中提了七百九十七条意见。职员和技术人员也都积极参加搜集材料。据四个工程处不完全统计，职工们提出的关于施工管理、工程质量等方面的意见共达二千七百九十六条。
    在这次施工检查中，大量揭发了过去在施工管理上的无人负责、工程质量低劣、浪费严重等事实。例如施工管理上严重缺乏计划性，几乎所有工地上的材料供应、工具供应、劳动力调配、每个时期的工作量和施工程序，都没有周密的计划，以致工作经常陷于混乱状态，并造成巨大浪费。例如由于材料供应不及时，工地上普遍是大料小用，长料短用，同济大学工地大料小用，锯断了一千多根长木头，剩下五万斤废木料只能用来烧火。闵行工地也因为大料小用而浪费了价值八千万元的木料。劳动力不按实际情况调配所造成的人工损失，在工地上也是普遍而严重的。例如上海公共交通汽车公司工地上有一次需要泥工，但却调来了三十九个其他工种的工人，结果这三十九人无事可做，只好让他们去敲混凝土。在检查工程质量中，发现许多工程有“沉、裂、斜、漏”的现象发生，其中以上海肺结核防治院（即澄衷疗养院）最为严重。造成许多工程质量低劣的原因是工人们错误地所谓实行“节约”，用料不按规格，不保证工程质量。如平台上本应铺牛毛毡和水柏油，结果因未用这些材料终于发生裂缝漏水。在施工时又单纯图快，不按规程办事。如装修的木料不晒干就用，以致以后发生干裂，黄沙未淘清就浇水泥，使黄沙与水泥失去黏性，致造成裂缝等等。工人们还提出了工地领导人忽视工人安全卫生、工地缺乏文化活动、不注意工人生活福利等意见。大量问题的揭发，使领导干部以及广大职工都大为震惊。例如闵行工程处工人们计算了一下：仅仅他们的各种浪费损失就有二亿一千多万元，可以买大米一千五百石，可以供十个人吃十八年零四个月。据四个工程处检查中极不完全的统计，各种浪费损失共达十九亿余元，而更主要的是使国家基本建设工程遭到了无可挽回的损害。工人们都痛心地说：“今年是国家五年建设计划开始的第一年，我们如果不通过这次检查，赶紧克服这些缺点，我们将会给国家造成多大的损失啊！”
    施工检查中也总结了过去关于推广先进工作法和合理化建议的工作。如上海工程处以储阿弟小组为重点，总结了实行双手挤浆工作法的经验，和木工中推行流水作业法，粉刷方面采用新工具的经验，结果证明新工作法都大大提高了工作效率和工作质量，因而节约了大量费用。如上海电线二厂工地推行双手挤浆法，工效提高了三倍。储阿弟小组在实行新工作法的三十二个工作日中，就比过去节省了九百六十余万元开支。施工检查中还检查了职工群众过去在工作中的许多创造和合理化建议。检查结果也都证明了工人大部分的创造和合理化建议对工作曾起了很大作用。如工人王承镐小组创造的粉明沟工具经施用后，提高工作效率五倍。在检查中工人们尖锐地批评了工地领导干部忽视工人创造性活动的官僚主义。各工地都没有专门负责处理合理化建议的机构和人员，没有奖惩制度，对工人们的创造改进不热情支持，甚至不理不睬，以致降低了工人们的积极性。
    施工检查使广大职工受到了实际有效的教育，鼓舞了工人们的生产积极性。在检查的最后阶段，许多工地都专门召开了“补漏洞”会议，工人们纷纷以主人翁态度提出改进工作的具体建议。闵行工程处一个混合小组就提出了改进意见四十条。工人们普遍要求经常召开生产会议，交流经验，要求学习技术，学习先进工作法。上海钢铁公司第二厂工地泥工组提出：“过去我们没用先进工作法操作，生产得慢，这是国家的损失，今后我们一定要学先进工作法。”大家都积极想办法，减少浪费，提高工作质量。上海电线二厂工地泥工王永离、凤木生在施工检查以后生产积极性提高，最近提出了一个
    “台度平粉”的合理化建议，并立即得到了领导干部的重视和支持，经施行后，证明既省工省料，又美观大方，一百三十五平方公尺面积的“台度”，就节省了三十包水泥和一百五十二个人工，约值二百余万元。这一方法如果普遍推广，将可节约很大的资金。施工检查后，工地领导上和职工的关系改善了，职工相互之间的团结也加强了，过去技术很保守的油漆工，也提出今后要多和大家商量研究，来改良油漆品质，提高工作质量。许多工地上都出现了新气象。
    现在，华东建筑工程公司已根据这次检查出来的问题，拟出了一套工地上各种责任制的草案，发到各工程处讨论补充，准备从上到下建立各种制度，克服过去工作中的无人负责状况，做好施工工作。
