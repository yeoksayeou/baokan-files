    Pay Attention to Preventing the Spread of Cotton Wilt and Verticillium Wilt
    Du Chunpei, Yu Zhiping
    Wilt and Verticillium wilt are devastating diseases to cotton. Cotton plants infected with these diseases will experience reduced yield in mild cases and death in severe cases. The pathogens of these diseases can survive in the soil for a long time (about ten years). Once infected, cotton fields cannot be used for cotton cultivation for a long time. Agricultural production leaders and supply and marketing cooperatives in all cotton-growing areas should pay special attention to prevention in the work of regulating cotton seeds.
    In recent years, these diseases have gradually spread in China's cotton-growing areas. Areas where these diseases have occurred include fourteen counties in Guanzhong, Xianyang, and Lintong in Shaanxi Province in the Northwest region, western Liaoning in the Northeast region, and some areas in Shanxi and Hebei Provinces in the North China region. In 1951, these diseases were only found in Taiyuan, Pingyao and other counties in Shanxi Province, but in 1952 they spread to eighteen counties. In the early days of liberation, only dozens of mu of cotton fields in the northern Sichuan area were affected by this disease, but in 1952 it expanded to several thousand mu.
    The first method to prevent the spread of this disease is to prohibit the export of cotton seeds from diseased areas. Cotton seeds from diseased areas should be purchased and processed into oil by the supply and marketing departments. The required cotton seeds for this year should be transferred from disease-free areas. Even if the cotton seeds are transferred in, they should be disinfected with 0.5% Ceresan when sowing.
    The second is to strengthen the cleaning of cotton fields. After cotton is sown, emerging cotton seedlings should be inspected at any time. If diseased seedlings are found, they should be pulled out and burned outside the field. When pruning, removing branches, and picking leaves, the branches and leaves should also be taken out of the field and burned.
    Cotton fields where serious diseases were found last year or where the disease was not serious last year but is expected to be serious this year should be rotated and planted with other crops starting this year, and cotton cultivation should be resumed after a period of time (about ten years or so).
    In carrying out this work, it is also very important to introduce the seriousness of this disease and prevention methods to the masses in cotton-growing areas. Only when the masses in cotton-growing areas can consciously participate in this work can the effect of prevention be greater.

    注意防范棉花枯萎病、黄萎病的传播
    杜春培  于志平
    枯萎病和黄萎病是对棉花带有毁灭性的病害。感染这种病害的棉株，轻的减产，重的枯死。这种病害的病菌能长期（约十年）在土壤中生活，一经感染，棉田就长期不能再种棉花。各棉区的农业生产领导部门和供销合作部门在调剂棉籽工作中应特别注意防范。
    近年来这种病害在我国棉区已逐渐蔓延。发生这种病害的地区有西北区陕西省的关中、咸阳、临潼等十四个县，东北区的辽西，华北区的山西、河北等省的若干地区。一九五一年山西省仅太谷、平遥等县发现，一九五二年就扩大到十八个县。四川省川北地区在解放初期，仅有数十亩棉田发生这种病害，一九五二年即扩大到了数千亩。
    防范这种病害传播的方法首先是禁止病区的棉籽出境。病害区的棉籽应由供销部门全部收购榨油。今年所需的棉籽由无病区调入。即是调入的棉籽，在播种时也要用千分之五的赛力散拌种消毒。
    其次是加强棉田的清洁工作。在棉花播种后要随时检查出土的棉苗，如发现有病象的棉苗即拔下拿到田外烧毁。在整枝、打桠、摘叶时，也应该把打下的枝叶拿到田外烧毁。
    在去年已发现严重病害或去年虽不严重估计今年可能严重的棉田，应该由今年起调茬换种其他作物，经过一个时期（约十年左右）后再恢复植棉。
    在进行这件工作中，向棉区群众介绍这种病害的严重性和防范方法也是很重要的。只有在棉区群众都能自觉参加这一工作，防范的效果才能更大。
