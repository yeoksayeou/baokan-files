    The Purpose of Socialist Production
  　Soviet Union  A. Koliagin
    "People's Daily" reader Smirnov asks: What is the purpose of socialist production?
    Comrade Stalin, in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," expounded the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism.
    The basic economic law does not determine individual aspects or individual processes in the development of a particular mode of production, but rather determines all its most important phenomena, determining the purpose of production and the means of achieving that purpose.
    The main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism lie in guaranteeing the maximum capitalist profit by exploiting and bankrupting the majority of the population of one's own country, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at ensuring the highest profits.
    Therefore, the purpose of capitalist production is not to meet people's needs, but to obtain profits. The role of the basic economic law of modern capitalism is to enable monopoly capital to obtain huge wealth and to continuously impoverish the workers. For example, the profits of monopoly capital in the United States in 1951 were one and a half times higher than during World War II. At the same time, the exploitation of workers was strengthened, their labor intensity was greatly increased, unemployment increased, housing was scarce, and workers became increasingly impoverished.
    If in capitalist society, people are governed by the ruthless law of extracting maximum profits, and for the sake of this maximum profit, people are destined to endure heavy suffering, poverty, unemployment, and bloody wars, then in socialist society, all production must be subject to people and their ever-growing needs. This is where socialism is a higher, newer, and absolutely superior social system to capitalism.
    Comrade Stalin, in explaining the characteristics of the basic economic law of socialism, pointed out that the characteristics and requirements of this law are to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by continuously improving and perfecting socialist production on the basis of advanced technology.
    Therefore, the purpose of socialist production is not for profit, but for people and their material and cultural needs.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Therefore, to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society is the purpose of socialist production; the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on the basis of advanced technology is the means to achieve this goal."
    The purpose of socialist production and the means to achieve this purpose stipulated by Stalin have great theoretical and practical significance. Our Party comprehensively considers the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism in its policies, and uses its role to serve the construction of a communist society.
    Comrade Stalin severely criticized the anti-Marxist views of certain economists who, in their opinion, turned production from a means into an end, and abandoned the guarantee of continuously increasing the material and cultural needs of society. As a result, increasing production is for the sake of increasing production, and production is an end in itself. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the purpose of production should not be confused with the means to achieve the purpose. However, even now, this error is still repeated in the speeches of some of our propagandists. When they explain J.V. Stalin's principle that ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society is the purpose of socialist production, they say that these needs cannot be reduced to the demands of members of society. They distort Marx's principle of the distribution of all social products in socialist society, and they arbitrarily say that the purpose of socialist production, in addition to meeting people's needs, must also meet the needs in compensating for the loss of means of production and expanding production. This is precisely confusing the purpose of socialist production with the means to achieve this purpose.
    Meeting the needs of social production cannot be an end in itself. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct to include meeting the needs of society in compensating for the loss of means of production and expanding production within the purpose of socialist production.
    Of course, socialist society cannot avoid compensating for the means of production that have been consumed, and continuously expanding social production. Marx's formula for the distribution of social products says this very clearly. However, Marx did not raise or answer the question of distinguishing between the purpose of socialist production and the means to achieve this purpose.
    Under the socialist system, the task placed before social production is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society within the limits of the currently achieved level of development of productive forces.
    A portion of these needs are met individually according to the socialist principle of distribution according to work. The needs for food, clothing, shoes, and other items are met in this way. These constantly increasing needs are met through the wages of workers and the cash and in-kind income of farmers.
    Most of the needs of the Soviet people, such as education, healthcare, recreation, sanatoriums, and cultural supplies, are basically met by the state.
    The development of Soviet society has proven the great achievements in realizing the purpose of socialist production. In our country, the system of human exploitation has been eliminated forever, and the unemployment, poverty, and bankruptcy of workers have been eliminated. The welfare of the Soviet people is constantly improving, which can be explained first of all by the rapid growth of the Soviet national income and the fact that three-quarters of the national income is used to meet the individual needs of workers. With the rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in the Soviet national income, the real wages of workers and the income of farmers are constantly increasing.
    In 1951, the real income of workers increased by approximately 57 percent per capita compared to 1940, and the real income of farmers increased by approximately 60 percent per capita.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan is a major step in raising the material welfare of the Soviet people and in our country's development from socialism to communism.
    During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, the national income of the Soviet Union will increase by at least 60 percent, the real wages of workers and the cash and in-kind income of collective farm members will be greatly increased, the living conditions of workers and their municipal public facilities will be greatly improved, and education, healthcare, and other aspects will be further developed.
    The purpose of socialist production is to meet the material and cultural needs of people. But this does not mean that the task of ensuring the continuous increase and continuous improvement of socialist production is secondary. On the contrary, Comrade Stalin pointed out that without the comprehensive development of production on the basis of advanced technology, it is inconceivable to achieve the purpose of socialist production, and it is impossible to guarantee that our country has an abundance of consumer goods. The Lenin-Stalin Party attaches primary importance to the development of industry, especially heavy industry, as the foundation for the development of the entire national economy.
    In his historically significant speech to voters on February 9, 1946, Comrade Stalin stipulated the future plan of the Communist Party. He said: "...the Party is determined to create a powerful new upsurge in the national economy, enabling us to—for example—raise our country's industrial level to three times higher than the pre-war level. We must enable our country's industry to produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil annually. Only when this step is achieved can it be said that our motherland has guarantees against all accidents."
    Comrade Stalin's historical speech inspired the Soviet people to struggle for the accelerated recovery and further strong development of the Soviet national economy.
    In order to achieve the purpose of socialist production, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, strive to achieve the continuous development of all production departments, and first of all the development of the industry that produces the means of production.
    In 1950, the Soviet Union's industrial output exceeded the 1940 level by 73 percent. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, the level of industrial production will increase by approximately 70 percent. This means that in 1955, industrial output will reach three times the pre-war 1940 level.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan clearly reflects the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, stipulating that priority should be given to increasing the production of the means of production, because it is a reliable guarantee for technological progress in all sectors of the national economy and the continuous increase in the entire social production.
    In the period of 1951-1955, the output of industries producing means of production will increase by approximately 80 percent. The production of Soviet machinery manufacturing and metallurgical processing industries, steam turbines, hydraulic turbines, boilers, metallurgical equipment, etc., will grow at the fastest speed.
    The superior growth of industries producing means of production is the basis for the rapid increase in industrial and agricultural consumer goods.
    Comrade Stalin's brilliant policy of developing heavy industry first ensures that in 1952, not only was the pre-war 1940 level of consumer goods production restored, but it was also exceeded by 60 percent. By the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it will exceed the 1950 level by approximately 65 percent. The increase in the technical equipment of socialist agriculture guarantees that the production of grain, cotton, flax, sugar beets, etc., grows at an unprecedented rate.
    Therefore, the purpose of socialist production is achieved by continuously and rapidly increasing production on the basis of advanced technology.
    Inspired by the genius ideas of Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress, the Soviet people are struggling with great enthusiasm to realize the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan, to continuously improve labor productivity, to better use technology, and to strengthen the power of the Soviet state. All of this will lead to a further rise in the material welfare and cultural level of the working people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and under the leadership of the great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people are advancing towards new victories in communist construction.

    社会主义生产的目的
  　苏联  阿·科梁金
    “真理报”读者斯米尔诺夫问：社会主义生产的目的是什么？
    斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”的著作中，阐明了现代资本主义的基本经济法则和社会主义的基本经济法则。
    基本经济法则不决定某一生产方式发展中的个别方面或个别过程，而是决定它的一切最重要的现象，决定生产的目的和达到这个生产目的的手段。
    现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，在于用剥削本国大多数居民并使其破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和经常掠夺其他各国人民，特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。
    因此，资本主义生产的目的，不是满足人们的需要，而是获取利润。现代资本主义基本经济法则的作用，是使垄断资本获得巨大财富，使劳动者不断贫困化。例如美国一九五一年垄断资本的利润，比第二次世界战争时期增加了一倍半。同时，加强了对工人的剥削，极力提高他们的劳动强度，失业增加，住宅缺乏，劳动者愈益贫困化。
    如果在资本主义社会里，人是受榨取最大利润的无情法则所支配，为了这个最大利润，人们注定要忍受沉重的苦难，贫穷，失业和流血的战争。那么在社会主义社会，一切生产都要服从人和他的不断增长的需要。社会主义是一种比资本主义更高级的，新的，绝对优越的社会制度，就在于此。
    斯大林同志在说明社会主义基本经济法则的特征时，指出这个法则的特点和要求，是用在高度技术基础上，使社会主义生产不断提高和不断完善的办法，来最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    因此，社会主义生产的目的，不是为了利润，而是为了人及其物质和文化的需要。
    斯大林同志指出：“因此，保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，就是社会主义生产的目的；在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善，就是达到这一目的的手段。”
    斯大林所规定的社会主义生产的目的及达到这个目的的手段，具有理论的和实际的巨大意义。我们的党在政策上全面地考虑到社会主义基本经济法则的要求，利用它的作用来为共产主义社会建设服务。
    斯大林同志曾对某些经济学家的反马克思主义的观点予以严厉的批评。按照这些经济学家的意见，是把生产从手段变为目的，而把保证不断增加社会的物质需要和文化需要抛弃。结果，增加生产就是为了增加生产，生产就是目的本身。斯大林同志指出，不能把生产的目的和达到目的的手段混为一谈。可是，直到现在，在我们某些宣传员的言论中，还重复着这个错误。他们在解释约·维·斯大林关于保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化需要是社会主义生产的目的这一原理时，说这些需要不能归结为社会成员的要求。他们曲解马克思关于社会主义社会全部社会产品分配的原理，他们武断地说，社会主义生产的目的，除了满足人的需要之外，还要满足在补偿生产手段的损耗和扩大生产方面的需要。这正是把社会主义生产的目的和为达到这个目的的手段混同了。
    满足社会生产的需要，不能是目的本身。因此，把满足社会在补偿生产手段的损耗和扩大生产中的需要包括在社会主义生产的目的之内，不能认为是正确的。
    当然，社会主义社会不免要补偿所消耗了的生产手段，并不断地扩大社会生产。关于这一点，马克思的社会产品的分配公式说得十分确切。但是，马克思在这里并没有提出也没有回答关于区分社会主义生产的目的和达到这个目的的手段问题。
    在社会主义制度下，摆在社会生产面前的任务，是在目前已达到的生产力发展的水平限度内，保证最大限度地满足社会物质和文化的需要。
    这些需要的一部分，是按照社会主义按劳取酬的分配原则而满足个人的。对食品、衣服、鞋等物品的需要就是这样。这些不断增加的需要，用职工的工资、农民的现金和实物收入的办法来满足。
    苏联人的大部分需要，如教育，保健，休养，疗养及文化供应等，基本上都是依靠国家来满足。
    苏联社会的发展，证明了实现社会主义生产目的的巨大成就。在我国，人剥削人的制度永远消灭了，而且消灭了劳动者的失业、贫穷和破产。苏联人的福利在不断地提高，关于这一点，首先可以用苏联国民收入的迅速增长和国民收入的四分之三是用来满足劳动者的个人需要来说明。随着工业和农业生产的迅速增长及苏联国民收入的增加，职工的实际工资和农民的收入都在不断地增加。
    一九五一年职工的实际收入，平均每人较一九四○年增加约百分之五十七，农民的实际收入，平均每人增加百分之六十左右。
    第五个五年计划是提高苏联人民的物质福利和我国从社会主义向共产主义发展的一大步。
    在第五个五年计划期间，苏联的国民收入至少增加百分之六十，职工的实际工资，集体农庄庄员的现金收入和实物收入，都将大大增加，劳动者的居住条件和他们的市政公用生活设备，都将大大改善，教育、保健等都将得到进一步的发展。
    社会主义生产的目的，就是满足人的物质和文化需要。但是这决不是说保证社会主义生产的不断增加和不断改善的任务是次要的。相反地，斯大林同志指出：没有在高度技术基础上的生产的全面发展，要达到社会主义生产的目的是不可思议的，就不可能保证我国有丰裕的消费品。列宁斯大林的党对于发展工业，首先是作为整个国民经济发展基础的重工业，赋予头等重要的意义。
    一九四六年二月九日斯大林同志在选民面前的具有历史意义的演说中，规定了共产党将来的计划。他说：“……党是立意要造成国民经济强大的新高涨，使我们能够——譬如说——把我国工业水准提高到超过战前水准达三倍。我们必须使我国工业能每年出产生铁达五千万吨，钢达六千万吨，煤炭达五万万吨，煤油达六千万吨。只有做到了这步时，才可以说，我们祖国已有了免除一切意外的保障。”
    斯大林同志的历史性的演说，鼓舞着苏联人民为苏联国民经济加速恢复和进一步强大发展而斗争。
    为了达到社会主义生产的目的，苏联人民在共产党的领导下，力求做到所有生产部门的不断发展，而首先是生产生产资料的工业的发展。
    一九五○年苏联的工业产量超过一九四○年水平百分之七十三。在第五个五年计划期间，工业生产水平提高约百分之七十。这就是说一九五五年工业产量将达到战前一九四○年的三倍。
    第五个五年计划明显地反映了社会主义基本经济法则的要求，规定了首先提高生产资料的生产，因为它是国民经济各部门中的技术进步和整个社会生产的不断增加的可靠保证条件。
    在一九五一—一九五五年这个时期，生产生产资料的工业的产量，约增加百分之八十。苏联的机器制造和冶金加工工业，蒸气透平，水力透平，汽锅，冶金设备等生产，将以最快的速度增长着。
    生产生产资料的工业的优越增长，是工业和农业的消费品迅速增加的基础。
    英明的斯大林的首先发展重工业的政策，保证在一九五二年不仅恢复而且超过了战前一九四○年消费品生产水平的百分之六十。到第五个五年计划终了，将超过一九五○年水平约百分之六十五。社会主义农业技术装备的增加，保证谷物、棉花、亚麻、甜菜等生产以空前未有的速度增长着。
    因此，社会主义生产的目的是用在高度的技术基础上不断迅速增加生产的办法来达到的。
    为斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的天才思想和第十九次党代表大会的决议所鼓舞的苏联人民，怀着极大的热忱，为实现第五个斯大林五年计划，为不断提高劳动生产率，更好地使用技术，加强苏联国家的威力而斗争。这一切将导致劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平的进一步高涨。苏联人民在共产党的领导下，在伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志的领导下前进，走向共产主义建设的新胜利。
