The work of eliminating illiteracy over the past year has yielded results. In factories, mines, government offices, and rural areas, many illiterate and semi-literate individuals have learned a certain number of characters, and many illiterate individuals have been elevated to semi-literate status. A large number of cadres engaged in the work of eliminating illiteracy have been trained in practical work, and some experience has been gained in areas such as organization and leadership, teacher training, and teaching methods. However, on the other hand, due to the insufficient understanding of the appropriate role of eliminating illiteracy in the overall national construction work and the long-term and complex nature of the work itself by leading cadres in various local cultural and educational departments, a rash and hasty approach emerged from the outset: disregarding actual conditions, failing to assess objective and subjective conditions, neglecting procedures, lacking thorough preparation, particularly inadequate preparation of teachers, expanding the scope of the work too quickly, emphasizing quantity over quality, resulting in serious phenomena of "dropouts," "half-baked learning," and "relapse," which affected the smooth progress of the work of eliminating illiteracy. This situation has improved in recent months due to the correct instructions from the central government, but on a national scale, the work of eliminating illiteracy has not yet been put on the right track.

The fundamental reason for the emergence of rash and hasty phenomena lies in the fact that the leading cultural and educational organs at all levels have not considered the problem from the actual situation when arranging work. In terms of the actual objective and subjective conditions, it is currently impossible to universally carry out a rapid literacy campaign. First, the focus of current national construction is economic construction, and all other tasks, including cultural work, must cooperate with economic construction. The positions of all tasks are fixed, and the allocation of manpower, materials, and financial resources has a certain proportion. Inappropriately emphasizing the work of eliminating illiteracy and expanding the scope of this work too much is an unrealistic approach. Second, the work of eliminating illiteracy is a very complex and delicate task, and it is necessary to grasp the characteristics and laws of mass cultural learning movements, and only by starting from the masses' living conditions, production conditions, and learning conditions can the work be carried out effectively. Due to the improvement of the political consciousness, production enthusiasm, and material living standards of the working people in New China, their demand for cultural learning has also greatly increased, which is an important condition for carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy. However, their living conditions, production conditions, learning conditions, and learning requirements are all different; personnel in government offices are different from soldiers in the army, soldiers are different from factory workers, factory workers are different from rural farmers, and different units in the same aspect also have different situations. If this diversity is ignored and the work of eliminating illiteracy is carried out in a uniform way, it is also unrealistic and prone to being divorced from the masses. Third, the rapid literacy method created by Qi Jianhua is certainly a new and powerful weapon for eliminating illiteracy, but it must be combined with the actual situation and can only play its due role under certain conditions. If the situation of students and teachers is not considered, and the learning conditions are not asked about, and the same methods are used across the board, it is also unrealistic and impossible to achieve the desired results. All of the above has been proven by the practical experience of the past year.

Because the work of eliminating illiteracy in the past lacked a spirit of seeking truth from facts, in the organization of learning, there was one-sided emphasis on standardization, and diverse forms were not adopted to meet the learning needs of the masses with different learning conditions in order to achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy, but only the form of rapid literacy classes was adopted. At the same time, in the teaching methods of rapid literacy, the rapid literacy method was not flexibly applied in connection with different actual situations, and it was often mechanically applied, which seriously affected the learning effect and the learning confidence of the students. In some places, the masses were even forced to participate in rapid literacy, turning a good thing into a bad thing and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. This situation is more serious in rural areas. The original common learning organizational forms in rural areas, such as winter schools, people's schools, literacy groups, kang-head groups, literacy cards, and little teacher systems, still have a significant role to play today, when it is impossible to universally carry out a rapid literacy campaign, and should not be ignored.

The work of eliminating illiteracy is a work with broad mass participation, and it is necessary to firmly follow the mass line. The task of leaders is to explain the principles clearly to the masses, open up the minds of the masses, and guide the masses to use diverse methods to solve their own cultural learning problems according to their own different situations. The masses know their own actual situation best, and they understand how to handle affairs according to the actual situation best. As long as we rely on them and go through their conscious and voluntary participation, any difficulties can be solved.

Recently, the National Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee of the Central People's Government convened a national illiteracy elimination work conference, summarized the experiences and lessons of the work of eliminating illiteracy based on the general policy of cultural and educational work, and clearly stipulated the future direction. All localities should immediately follow these guidelines, and according to the actual situation of the local area, through appropriate meetings, earnestly examine and summarize the past work, and thoroughly open up the minds of the cadres. Then, in accordance with the principle of carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy in a prepared, focused, and step-by-step manner, formulate realistic work plans that are in line with the actual situation, and implement them conscientiously. All localities must determine appropriate staffing levels, establish necessary leadership systems, strengthen leadership institutions, and strengthen leadership work; rectify the teaching staff according to certain standards, combine local materials, short-term training, and long-term training, and establish an effective in-service teacher learning system (such as a layer-by-layer transfer system) to continuously improve the political and professional level of teachers; rectify the existing learning organizations in a realistic manner. Places where there are indeed conditions to run rapid literacy classes should persist in doing so and strengthen leadership to effectively improve the quality of teaching, while the learning time, teaching progress, and teaching methods of rapid literacy classes should also be considered from a long-term perspective according to the different situations of the students, and should not be mechanically applied or forced to be consistent. Places where there are no conditions to run rapid literacy classes should use various common learning organizational forms and handle matters according to the needs and voluntariness of the masses, and should not be rude or impatient, giving the masses the feeling of coercion and command.

The key to improving the work of eliminating illiteracy lies in strengthening leadership, ensuring that everything is handled in accordance with the actual situation, concretely grasping the characteristics and laws of the mass cultural learning movement, regularly and deeply inspecting the work, earnestly summarizing work experience, and establishing a good style of wholeheartedly serving the masses. Leading cadres must effectively grasp the key points and systematically create typical experiences in a planned way. Regarding how to solve the contradiction between learning and production, the combination of the work of eliminating illiteracy and the central work, the combination of learning organizations and production organizations, the problem of mutual assistance, batch rotation learning, the problem of segmented teaching, and the method of using layer-by-layer transmission to improve teaching quality, some experiences have been explored in various places, which should be further summarized, improved, and systematized, and new experiences should be created. The promotion of typical experiences should be very cautious, and should not be applied mechanically.

The Party committees and cultural and educational leading organs in all localities must correctly understand the great significance of the work of eliminating illiteracy and the necessity of carrying out this work in a prepared, focused, and step-by-step manner, and treat this work with a cautious, responsible, and active attitude. While correcting the phenomenon of rash and hasty advances, it is necessary to prevent the tendency of passive coping and stagnation, so that our work of eliminating illiteracy can be put on the right track.

### 扫除文盲的工作必须整顿

    扫除文盲的工作必须整顿
    一年来的扫除文盲工作是有成绩的。厂矿、机关和农村里不少文盲和半文盲都认识了一定数量的字，也有不少文盲被提高到半文盲，大批扫除文盲工作干部在实际工作中受到了锻炼，而在组织领导、培养师资和教学方法等方面，也取得了一些经验。但在另一方面，由于各地文教工作的领导干部对扫除文盲工作在整个国家建设工作中的适当地位和扫除文盲工作本身的长期性和复杂性，认识不足，一开始便出现了轻率冒进的现象：不看实际情况，不估计主客观条件，不讲究步骤，没有周密的准备，特别是师资的准备很不够，一下子把摊子铺得太大，重量不重质，造成了严重的“掉队”、“夹生”和“回生”的现象，影响了扫除文盲工作的顺利开展。这种情况，由于中央的正确指示，在最近几个月中有了改进，但就全国范围来说，扫除文盲工作至今还没有走上正轨。
    产生轻率冒进现象的基本原因，在于各级文教领导机关没有从实际出发考虑问题，布置工作。就实际的主客观条件说，目前不可能普遍开展速成识字运动。第一，当前国家建设的重点是经济建设，包括文化工作在内的其他各项工作，都必须配合经济建设。各项工作的位子都是摆定了的，人力、物力和财力的分配，都有一定的比例。不适当地强调扫除文盲工作，把这一工作的摊子铺得太大，就是不切实际的做法。第二，扫除文盲工作是非常复杂精细的工作，必须掌握群众性的文化学习运动的特点和规律，从群众的生活情况、生产情况和学习条件出发，才能有效地开展工作。由于新中国劳动人民的政治觉悟、生产热情和物质生活水平的提高，他们对文化学习的要求也大大提高了，这是开展扫除文盲工作的重要条件。但他们的生活情况、生产情况、学习条件和学习要求，都是不相同的，机关人员不同于部队战士，部队战士不同于工厂工人，工厂工人又不同于乡村农民，而同一方面的不同单位，也各有不同的情况。如果忽视这种多样性，用千篇一律的方式方法来进行扫除文盲工作，也是不切实际的，容易脱离群众。第三，祁建华所创造的速成识字法，固然是扫除文盲的新式利器，但它必须与实际情况相结合，在一定条件之下，才能发挥应有的作用。如果不看学员和师资的情况如何，不问学习条件如何，一律运用同样的方式方法，也是不切实际的，不可能收到应有的效果。上述一切，都由一年来的实际经验证明了。
    因为过去扫除文盲工作缺乏实事求是的精神，所以在学习组织上，片面强调正规化，不采用多种多样的形式，以满足具有不同学习条件的群众的学习要求，以达到扫除文盲的目的，而单纯采用速成识字班的形式。同时，在速成识字的教学方法上，也没有联系不同的实际情况，灵活运用速成识字法，往往生搬硬套，严重影响学习效果和学员的学习信心。有的地方甚至强迫群众参加速成识字，将好事办成了坏事，引起群众不满。这种情况在农村中较为严重。农村原有的通常学习组织形式，如冬学、民校、识字小组、炕头小组、识字牌、小先生制等，在不可能普遍开展速成识字运动的今天，仍有其重大作用，不应忽视。
    扫除文盲工作是具有广泛群众性的工作，必须坚决走群众路线。领导者的任务，就是要向群众讲清道理，打通群众思想，引导群众根据各自不同的情况，运用多种多样的方式方法来解决自己的文化学习问题。群众最了解自己的实际情况，最懂得根据实际情况办事，只要依靠他们，通过他们的自觉自愿，什么困难都是可能解决的。
    最近中央人民政府扫除文盲工作委员会召开了全国扫除文盲工作会议，根据文化教育工作总方针，总结了扫除文盲工作的经验教训，明确地规定了今后的方针。各地应即按照这些方针，根据当地实际情况，通过适当会议，认真检查和总结过去的工作，彻底打通干部思想。然后依照有准备、有重点、有步骤地开展扫除文盲工作的原则，实事求是地订出切合实际的工作计划，切实执行。各地必须确定适当的干部编制，建立必要的领导体系，充实领导机构，加强领导工作；根据一定标准，整顿教师队伍，就地取材，短期训练和长期培养相结合，建立有效的在职教师学习制度（如层层传授制度），不断提高教师的政治水平和业务水平；实事求是地整顿现有的学习组织。确有条件举办速成识字班的地方，应坚持下去，并加强领导，切实提高教学质量，而速成识字班的学习时间、教学进度和教学方法，也要根据学员的不同情况，从长考虑，切勿生搬硬套，强求一致。没有条件开办速成识字班的地方，应利用各种通常学习组织形式，按群众需要和自愿办事，切勿粗暴急躁，给群众以强迫命令的感觉。
    改进扫除文盲工作的关键在于加强领导，保证处处按照实际情况办事，具体掌握群众文化学习运动的特点和规律，经常深入地检查工作，认真总结工作经验，树立老老实实为群众服务的优良作风。领导干部必须切实掌握重点，有计划地创造较有系统的典型经验。关于怎样解决学习和生产的矛盾问题、扫除文盲工作和中心工作相结合的问题、学习组织和生产组织相结合的问题、互助分批轮换学习的问题、分段教学问题以及用层层传授的方法来提高教学质量问题，各地已经摸索出一些经验，应该进一步加以总结、提高和系统化，并创造新的经验。推行典型经验，要非常慎重，切勿生硬搬用。
    各地党委和文教领导机关必须正确认识扫除文盲工作的重大意义和有准备、有重点、有步骤地开展这一工作的必要性，用慎重、负责和积极的态度来对待这一工作。在纠正轻率冒进现象的同时，要防止消极应付、稳而不进的偏向，使我们的扫除文盲工作走上正轨。
