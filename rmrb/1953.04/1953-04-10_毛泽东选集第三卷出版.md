The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," published under the auspices of the Publishing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Volume III, has been published by the People's Publishing House and will be distributed by Xinhua Bookstores nationwide starting April 10th.

Included in Volume III of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" are the works of Comrade Mao Zedong from March 1941 to August 1945, the time when the Anti-Japanese War achieved its final victory. These include "'Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Survey'", "Reform Our Study," "On the International United Front Against Fascism," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "The Turning Point of World War II," "Economic and Financial Problems in the Anti-Japanese War," "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," "Launch the Movement of Rent Reduction, Production, and Support the Government and Cherish the People in the Base Areas," "Get Organized!", "Study and the Situation," "We Must Learn to Do Economic Work," "On Coalition Government," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "On the Importance of Army Production for Self-Support, Combined with the Two Major Movements of Rectification and Production," "The Danger of Hurley's Policy," and other treatises.

The three speeches, "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," are Comrade Mao Zedong's fundamental works on the rectification movement. In these works, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the ideological roots of past intra-Party line divergences, analyzed the petty-bourgeois ideology widely present within the Party and the subjectivist style reflecting this ideology, and pointed out that this anti-scientific, anti-Marxist style is a great enemy of the proletariat, an enemy of the people, and a manifestation of impure Party spirit. Comrade Mao Zedong vigorously promoted dialectical materialism and historical materialism and proposed "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and cure the sickness to save the patient" as the guiding principle for handling ideological problems within the Party. The rectification movement achieved great success. As Comrade Mao Zedong later said in his famous work, "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," "The main achievement lies in enabling our leading organs and many cadres and Party members to further grasp the fundamental direction that unites the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution." The rectification movement enabled the Party to achieve unprecedented unity and unification on the basis of Marxist-Leninist thought.

Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" systematically resolved the long-standing controversies in the modern Chinese literary and artistic movement by applying Marxism-Leninism. This was an important result of the great debate between proletarian ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology on literary and artistic issues during the rectification movement. Comrade Mao Zedong's speech eliminated many errors and confusions regarding literary and artistic issues and opened a new historical period for the Chinese people's literary and artistic movement.

In "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," Comrade Mao Zedong concentrated the experience of the rectification movement, and also concentrated the long-term experience of our Party in leading revolutionary work, providing the best explanation of the basic methods of leadership work.

"Economic and Financial Problems in the Anti-Japanese War," "Launch the Movement of Rent-Reduction, Production and Support the Government and Cherish the People in the Base Areas," "Get Organized!", and "We Must Learn to Do Economic Work" are the basic programs of the Party in leading the production movement in the liberated areas at that time. Comrade Mao Zedong carried out a two-front struggle on economic and financial issues, mainly opposing the conservative view that focused solely on fiscal revenue and expenditure issues while deviating from economic development on one hand, and opposing unrealistic grand plans for development that disregarded the specific conditions of time and place on the other. Based on Lenin and Stalin's theory of attracting peasants to socialism through cooperation, Comrade Mao Zedong concentrated the Chinese peasants' original experience in production cooperation (such as mutual aid teams) as well as the experience in this regard in the red areas during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, and proposed the policy of establishing agricultural collective labor organizations based on individual economy (without destroying the foundation of individual private property) in accordance with the principle of peasant voluntarism under the current historical conditions.

In Comrade Mao Zedong's article "On the Importance of Army Production for Self-Support, Combined with the Two Major Movements of Rectification and Production," he summarized the historical significance of the rectification movement and the production movement, saying: "The universal rectification movement and production movement, which began in 1942 and 1943 respectively, have played and are playing a decisive role in spiritual and material life respectively. If we do not seize these two links at the appropriate time, we will not be able to seize the entire revolutionary chain, and our struggle will not be able to continue to advance." The rectification movement laid the ideological foundation for our Party to prepare for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and the production movement in the liberated areas prepared the material foundation for this victory.

The article "The Turning Point of World War II" was written by Comrade Mao Zedong in early October 1942, just at the critical moment of the heroic defense of Stalingrad. In this essay, Comrade Mao Zedong foresaw the great victory of the Soviet Red Army and made the following judgment: "This battle is not only the turning point of the Soviet-German War, nor even just the turning point of this World Anti-Fascist War, but also the turning point of the entire human history."

The article "Study and the Situation" made a basic summary of the Party's history during the Anti-Japanese War. In this essay, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the changes in the balance of power between the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces in China, foresaw that the Chinese people already had the possibility of moving from achieving victories in the countryside to achieving victories in the cities; it was already possible to move from achieving victories in various base areas to achieving the linking of various base areas into one piece, and to achieving national victory. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in order to win and consolidate the victory of the revolution, the Chinese Communist Party must avoid pride and strive to learn the Marxist method of analyzing things.

Comrade Mao Zedong's political report, "On Coalition Government," delivered at the Party's Seventh National Congress, comprehensively summarized the experience of the struggle between the two lines of the Communist Party and the Kuomintang during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and put forward the general program and concrete program for uniting the people of the whole country to strive for victory. This report, following "On New Democracy," had a great effect on mobilizing the people of the whole country.

At the Party's Seventh National Congress, and in articles written after the meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized the reactionary policy of the U.S. government to support Chiang Kai-shek and oppose the Communists, foresaw the danger of U.S. imperialism replacing Japanese imperialism in China's position of aggression, and called on the entire Party to ideologically prepare to deal with U.S. imperialism's aggression in China, in order to avoid panic in the face of possible new events.

Volume III of the Selected Works is appended with the "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues" of the Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This is a detailed conclusion made by the Party Central Committee on the errors of the "Left" leaning opportunist line within the Party from the beginning of 1931 to the end of 1934. This document gives a concise explanation of Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding achievements in applying Marxist-Leninist theory and methods to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III, published under the auspices of the Publishing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, has been published by the People's Publishing House. Starting from the 10th, it will be simultaneously distributed by Xinhua Bookstores in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenyang, Harbin, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, as well as medium and small cities with convenient transportation throughout the country. Branches of the China Book Distribution Company in various places will also distribute a portion starting from the 10th.

The first batch of 1.5 million copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III, were printed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Changchun and then transported to various places for sale. Remote areas and cities with inconvenient transportation will not be able to distribute them simultaneously on the 10th due to the longer shipping time and will be distributed after the 10th.

The second batch of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III, is planned to be printed with 600,000 copies and can be distributed in the second half of this year. (Attached picture)

    毛泽东选集第三卷出版
    【本报讯】中共中央毛泽东选集出版委员会主持出版的“毛泽东选集”，其第三卷已由人民出版社出版，自四月十日起由全国各地新华书店发行。
    编入“毛泽东选集”第三卷的，是毛泽东同志从一九四一年三月至一九四五年八月抗日战争取得最后胜利时的著作，包括“‘农村调查’的序言和跋”、“改造我们的学习”、“关于反法西斯的国际统一战线”、“整顿党的作风”、“反对党八股”、“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”、“第二次世界大战的转折点”、“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”、“关于领导方法的若干问题”、“开展根据地的减租、生产和拥政爱民运动”、“组织起来”、“学习和时局”、“必须学会做经济工作”、“论联合政府”、“愚公移山”、“论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性”、“评赫尔利政策的危险”和其他论著。
    “改造我们的学习”、“整顿党的作风”和“反对党八股”三篇演说，是毛泽东同志关于整风运动的基本著作。在这些著作里，毛泽东同志总结了过去党内路线分歧的思想根源，分析了广泛存在于党内的小资产阶级思想和反映小资产阶级思想的主观主义的作风，指出这种反科学、反马克思主义的作风，是无产阶级的大敌，是人民的大敌，是党性不纯的表现。毛泽东同志大力地宣传辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，并提出了“惩前毖后，治病救人”作为处理党内思想问题的方针。整风运动收到了极大的成效，正如毛泽东同志后来在“目前形势和我们的任务”这篇名著里所说的，“这种成效，主要的是在于使我们的领导机关及许多干部和党员，进一步地掌握了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践的统一这样一个基本的方向”。整风运动使党在马克思列宁主义思想的基础上，达到了空前未有的团结和统一。
    毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，应用马克思列宁主义系统地解决了中国现代文艺运动中长期存在的争论问题。这是整风运动中无产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想大论争反映在文艺问题上的重要结果。毛泽东同志的这篇讲话，扫除了关于文艺问题上的许多错误和混乱，开辟了中国人民文艺运动的新的历史时期。
    在“关于领导方法的若干问题”中，毛泽东同志集中了整风运动的经验，同时也是集中了我们党领导革命工作的长时期的经验，对于领导工作的基本方法作了最好的说明。
    “抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”、“开展根据地的减租、生产和拥政爱民运动”、“组织起来”和“必须学会做经济工作”等文，是党在当时领导解放区生产运动的基本纲领。毛泽东同志在经济和财政问题上进行了两条战线的斗争，即一方面主要地反对了离开发展经济单纯在财政收支问题上打圈子的保守观点；另方面反对了不顾时间地点的具体条件空嚷发展的不切实际的大计划。毛泽东同志根据了列宁斯大林关于经过合作的道路吸引农民走向社会主义的理论，集中了中国农民原有的生产合作（变工之类）的经验以及第二次国内革命战争时期红色区域在这方面的经验，提出了在现在历史条件下，按照农民自愿的原则，建立以个体经济为基础（不破坏个体的私有财产基础）的农业集体劳动组织的方针。
    毛泽东同志在“论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性”一文中，总结整风运动和生产运动的历史意义说：“一九四二和一九四三两年先后开始的带普遍性的整风运动和生产运动，曾经分别地在精神生活方面和物质生活方面起了和正在起着决定性的作用。这两个环子，如果不在适当时机抓住它们，我们就无法抓住整个的革命链条，而我们的斗争也就不能继续前进。”整风运动奠定了我们党准备中国人民革命胜利的思想基础，解放区的生产运动则为这个胜利准备了物质基础。
    “第二次世界大战的转折点”一文，是毛泽东同志在一九四二年十月初，即正当斯大林格勒英勇保卫战的重要关头写的。毛泽东同志在这篇论文里，预见苏联红军的伟大胜利，并作了以下的断语：“这一战，不但是苏德战争的转折点，甚至也不但是这次世界反法西斯战争的转折点，而且是整个人类历史的转折点。”
    “学习和时局”一文对于党在抗日时期的历史作了基本的总结。在这篇论文里，毛泽东同志根据中国革命力量和反革命力量对比的变化，预见中国人民已经有可能由取得乡村的胜利进到取得城市的胜利；已经有可能由取得各个根据地的胜利进到取得各根据地联成一片，并进到取得全国的胜利。毛泽东同志指出：中国共产党为着获得和巩固革命的胜利，就必须避免骄傲和努力学会马克思主义的分析事物的方法。
    毛泽东同志在党的第七次全国代表大会上所作的“论联合政府”的政治报告，全面地总结了抗日战争八年中共产党和国民党两条路线斗争的经验，提出了团结全国人民争取胜利的一般纲领和具体纲领。这个报告继“新民主主义论”收到了动员全国人民的极大效果。
    在党的第七次全国代表大会上，以及在会后所写的文章里，毛泽东同志都着重地指出了美国政府扶蒋反共的反动政策，预见美帝国主义代替日本帝国主义在中国的侵略地位的危险性，号召全党在思想上准备对付美帝国主义在中国的侵略，以避免在可能到来的新事变面前的惊惶失措。
    选集第三卷附录了中国共产党第八届中央委员会扩大的第七次全体会议“关于若干历史问题的决议”。这是党中央对于一九三一年初到一九三四年底的党内“左”倾机会主义路线的错误所作的详细结论。这个文件，对于毛泽东同志应用马克思列宁主义的理论和方法来解决中国革命问题的杰出成就，作了扼要的说明。
    【新华社九日讯】中共中央毛泽东选集出版委员会主持出版的“毛泽东选集”，第三卷已由人民出版社出版。十日起，由北京、天津、上海、南京、沈阳、哈尔滨、广州、汉口、重庆、西安等大城市及全国交通便利的中、小城市的新华书店同时发行。中国图书发行公司各地分公司也自十日起发行一部分。
    这次发行的第一批“毛泽东选集”第三卷共一百五十万册，是在北京、上海、长春三地印就后运往各地发售的。边远地区及交通不便的城市，由于运送费时较长，不及在十日同时发行，将在十日以后发行。
    第二批“毛泽东选集”第三卷准备印六十万册，今年下半年可以发行。（附图片）
