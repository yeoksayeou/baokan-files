    Sent from the Korean Front

    To all the students of Class One, Senior Three, Affiliated Girls' High School of Beijing Normal University:

    You said in your letter that you like to hear our combat stories very much. Now, let us tell you a story that happened not long ago: One dark night, the higher-ups gave us a mission: to reconnoiter the enemy situation at an American army regimental headquarters forty *li* away from our position. The mission was very urgent and had to be completed within five hours. "The opportunity to send good news to the people of the motherland has arrived!" We thought as we prepared our equipment. We each set off with three hand grenades and a Mauser pistol. After passing through several enemy blockades, we arrived at our destination. Through the dense branches, we could see the American sentry at the entrance of the enemy headquarters. That fellow was quite tall, shivering from the cold, and holding his gun crookedly. Wang Wanshu took the opportunity to slip in, while the remaining two of us hid in the grass, monitoring the enemy's movements. After a while, an American soldier swaggered out from inside, with a cigarette in his mouth, looking like an officer. He muttered a few words to the sentry and walked away. Wang Wanshu cleverly followed closely behind him and signaled us, and we swiftly made a sudden move and captured this guy alive. That very night, we launched a fierce attack on the enemy. After two hours of intense fighting, we completely defeated the American regiment. At the celebration meeting after the battle, we three each received a meritorious service citation.

    Comrades, there is no way to finish telling you combat stories like these. Every victory of ours is achieved under the greatest care and support of the people of the motherland. Whenever we learn about the construction of the motherland and the lives of the people from your letters, especially when the people of the motherland give us the highest praise, how happy and encouraged we are! The motherland is the source of our infinite strength. We must send back more victory news to the people of the motherland!

    寄自朝鲜前线北京师范大学附属女子中学校高三一班全体同学们：
    你们来信说你们很喜欢听我们的战斗故事，现在，让我们告诉你们一个在不久前发生的故事吧：在一个漆黑的夜晚，上级给了我们一个任务：到距我们阵地四十华里的一个美军的团司令部去侦察敌情。任务非常紧急，要在五小时内完成。“给祖国人民送喜讯的机会到了！”我们边想边整顿行装。我们每人带着三个手雷、一支驳壳枪出发了。穿过了敌人好几道封锁线，我们到达了目的地。透过密密的树枝，可以看到敌军司令部门口的美国哨兵。那家伙个子挺高，冻得直哆嗦，枪也歪拿着。王万书乘机钻进去，剩下的两个人隐蔽在草地上，监视着敌人的行动。一会儿，一个美国兵从里面大摇大摆地走出来，嘴里还刁着一支烟卷，看样子像个军官。他和那站岗的咕噜了几句，就走开了。王万书机灵地紧紧跟在他的后面，并给我们示了一个暗号，大家便灵敏地来一个突然的动作，就把这家伙生擒过来了。就在这天晚上，我们向敌人发起了猛攻。两个钟头的激烈战斗，全部打垮了美军这一个团的兵力。在战斗结束的庆功会上，我们三个人各立大功一次。
    同学们，像这样的战斗故事，是没有法子给你们讲完的。我们的每一次胜利都是在祖国人民最大的关怀和支持下得来的。每当我们从你们的来信里知道了祖国的建设和祖国人民的生活情形，特别是祖国人民给我们以最高的赞誉时，我们是如何地欢欣鼓舞呀！祖国，是我们无限力量的源泉。我们一定要给祖国人民送回更多的胜利消息！志愿军某部战士  王万书  乔世良  周盛隆
