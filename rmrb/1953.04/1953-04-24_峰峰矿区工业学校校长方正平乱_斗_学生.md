According to the Hebei Daily: Fang Zhengping and others, the principal of the Fengfeng Mining Area Industrial School, violated laws and regulations, suppressed democracy, and mistakenly used the method of "struggle" to deal with student problems, seriously damaging the students' physical and mental health. When the superior Party committee sent people to inspect, they insisted on their mistakes and resisted the Party committee's inspection, causing great damage to the school's educational work.

When the Fengfeng Mining Area Industrial School started in the autumn of last year, it received a group of students recommended from Huainan, Hebei, the Northwest, and other places, including 178 students from Huainan Coal Mine Vocational School. When mobilizing these students to come to the school, it was estimated that there would be difficulties, so the recruiters adopted the method of emphasizing superior material conditions to mobilize students, saying: "After arriving in Fengfeng, you will receive a scholarship of 115 jin of rice per month, and each person will receive a set of cotton clothing." However, after the students arrived at the school, the school changed the scholarship to 100 jin of rice according to the instructions of the higher authorities, and did not issue cotton clothing. This caused dissatisfaction among the students. In addition, these students were new to the north and not accustomed to the life, and there were some unreasonable aspects in the division of departments and classes, so they had great ideological fluctuations. At this time, the school leaders should have educated the new students, explained the problems clearly, and enabled them to concentrate on their studies, but the school leaders adopted a bureaucratic attitude and ignored them. The students were very dissatisfied. On September 27, a student search of the mailroom occurred.

This incident was caused by several students from Huainan. Because some students from Huainan wrote home asking for cotton clothes, but never received a reply, some students suspected that the mailroom had withheld the letters. This suspicion of the students was somewhat based on the fact that before the "Three-Anti" campaign, the school had arbitrarily checked the letters of students and teachers. On another occasion, student Shen Youlin saw the mail clerk tear up a letter (according to the mail clerk, it was tearing up his own letter). On September 27 last year, Zhou Biwei (a 16- or 17-year-old child) and two other students from Huainan discussed writing to Huainan Coal Mine Vocational School, wanting to reflect their dissatisfaction with the school, but they were afraid that the mail clerk would withhold and tear it up, so Zhou Biwei encouraged his classmates to search the mailroom.

When Zhou Biwei and others searched the mailroom and questioned the mail clerk about tearing up the letters, more and more students gathered, and they found torn letters in the wastepaper basket (it has not yet been determined whether they were other people's private letters). In this way, everyone believed that the mail clerk tearing up letters was indeed a fact. In addition, the mail clerk's work attitude was usually bad, so these students demanded that the mail clerk be punished. The students reported this to the Dean of Studies, Zhang Buying, twice (the principal was in Beijing for a meeting at the time and was not at the school), but Zhang Buying did not pay attention. Later, the students clamored to push the mail clerk to the entrance of the Dean of Studies' office. When Zhang Buying saw this, he panicked and did not dare to persuade and educate the students to stop this wrong action, but illegally detained the mail clerk and closed the mailroom according to the students' opinions.

After this incident occurred, the school leaders still did not conduct in-depth investigation and research to analyze the causes of the incident and deal with it in a timely manner. Instead, they blindly asked students to elect representatives to deal with the matter. Zhang Kaiyou, a student from Huainan, had an argument with his classmate Zhou Qingkui while discussing the election of representatives in the dormitory, and stabbed Zhou Qingkui's left arm with scissors. On the afternoon of October 2, when students from Huainan were divided into groups in the courtyard to convey the spirit of the student representative meeting, Zhou Biwei, because he was dissatisfied with the school's solution to the problem, was temporarily angered and threw three stones into the courtyard. On October 4, a fire broke out in the school toilet (the cause of the fire is still under investigation). Based on these continuous incidents, the school leaders arbitrarily believed that this was "a planned activity by a few bad elements." Xue Shifang, secretary of the Propaganda Department of the Fengfeng Coal Mine Party Committee, and Li Huayi, chief of the Education Section of the Personnel Department of the Mining Bureau, did not conduct in-depth understanding of the actual situation during the investigation, and blindly believed in the school's opinion. Xue Shifang and others, based on the fact that some students saw that it seemed that student Zhai Shiqin came out of the toilet when the fire broke out, and also based on the fact that Zhai Shiqin usually played with fire, used the method of four people taking turns to force a confession, forcing Zhai Shiqin to admit it. Zhai Shiqin could not bear the pressure and admitted that he and Wei Yuanrui were in collusion. In this way, under the leadership of Principal Fang Zhengping (who had returned to the school at this time) and Xue Shifang, Li Huayi, and others, completely violating the education policies of the Party and the People's Government, they arbitrarily convened a so-called conference to expose the "truth of the September 27 incident", attempting to use the method of dealing with counter-revolutionaries to deal with internal student problems. At the meeting, Fang Zhengping said: "This incident is an organized illegal action. All those who actively or passively participated in this incident must confess to the people and start anew." Xue Shifang said: "This incident was caused by bad elements luring backward elements to incite the masses." Before the meeting, Fang Zhengping also convened a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and cadres, calling on them to take the lead in confessing, and arranging for each class to elect three people to confess. He also arranged for students to supervise each other at the meeting, and there were sentries outside the meeting place. Under these circumstances, the students wrote more than 1,000 accusation notes, and a total of 24 people were forced to confess on stage, and more than 60 people wrote confessions after the meeting. The students who confessed generally talked about trivial matters and put a "reactionary" hat on themselves. Wei Yuanrui, a student from Huainan, confessed three times on stage, but he was considered not thorough enough. He finally had to admit to "illegal organization of a propaganda team and an agitation team" (in fact, this did not exist). Zhai Shiqin was punished to stand on the stage for an hour because he could not confess the fact of arson, until he was so tired that he was sweating before he was told to step down. At this meeting, the method of "collective photography" and "individual photography" was also used to humiliate the students' personality. That is, as long as someone suggested that a few students or a certain student was suspected, they would be called to stand on the stage collectively or individually for everyone to see.

This confession and denunciation meeting lasted for three days. Finally, Li Huayi made a slanderous conclusion about the students, saying that among the students "there are feudal groups, each dominating one side, falsely accusing leaders, this is a loss of conscience, despicable and shameless, unstable position, anti-Party and anti-people behavior." After the meeting, they also wrote a false report to the Fengfeng Coal Mine Party Committee, saying: "The meeting was very successful and there were great gains..." The Party Committee listened to their report one-sidedly, and not only did not discover the above-mentioned extremely erroneous behavior, but also erroneously approved the school's decision to expel student Zhou Biwei and give student Wei Yuanrui and others demerits.

This incident caused a very bad influence among the students, and many students wanted to leave the school. They sent representatives to the Fengfeng Coal Mine Party Committee to report the situation, but were stopped by Fang Zhengping. They also wrote letters to the Education Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government to file complaints. Later, the North China Administrative Committee, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the North China Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, together with the Fengfeng Mining Area Party Committee of the CPC, the Fengfeng Mining Area People's Government, and the Fengfeng Mining Area Committee of the Youth League, etc., formed an investigation team to conduct five investigations into the matter, and finally clarified the truth of the incident.

During the investigation, it was found that Fang Zhengping, the principal of the Fengfeng Mining Area Industrial School, had behaviors of suppressing criticism, suppressing democracy, and violating laws and regulations. In the process of serving as principal and secretary of the Party branch, he often regarded himself as an "old cadre" and wanted to turn the school into his own "small world." He once publicly said to the teachers: "Writing articles for newspapers must be reviewed by the branch and stamped by the school, otherwise the newspaper will not publish them." He also said: "It is easy for the principal to remove a teacher." When school started in the autumn of last year, student Zhang Qimin offended Fang Zhengping because he had represented the students in making suggestions to the school and writing letters to the Education Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government. Therefore, before the start of this confession and denunciation meeting, Fang Zhengping not only said at the Party and Youth League cadre meeting that Zhang Qimin "did not confess thoroughly and was not qualified to be a Party member," but also groundlessly called Zhang Qimin to the stage to confess. Zhang Qimin, due to being mentally traumatized, is now resting with a serious illness. As early as the autumn of 1951, students Tian Hongchen and Wang Rushen were detained for a day and expelled by the school because they expressed dissatisfaction with the school. In the spring of 1952, student Zhang Jiaxun was also expelled after Fang Zhengping convened a general assembly of teachers and students to "struggle" against him because he was dissatisfied with the school. More seriously, when a teacher at the school lost something, Fang Zhengping arrested worker Chen Zaihui and detained him in the police station for 20 days without asking questions, and later found out that another cart driver had stolen it.

When the higher authorities went to the school to conduct investigations, Fang Zhengping tried his best to obstruct them, attempting to prevent the higher authorities from clarifying the truth of the matter. In October last year, when the Education Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Youth League sent people to investigate, Fang Zhengping was away on business, so he wrote a letter asking the school's secretary, Gao Fushan, to pay attention to the activities of the investigators. During the fourth investigation in November last year, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also sent people to participate. Fang Zhengping instructed tutor Zhang Wenli (a member of the Youth League) to monitor the actions of the investigators, and asked Zhang Wenli to write down the names of the teachers who had been in contact with the investigators and report them to him. At the same time, he also instructed Zhang Wenli to spread rumors among the teachers that "the opinions of the Fengfeng Coal Mine Party Committee and the Hebei Province investigators are inconsistent in the handling of the mailroom search incident," attempting to confuse the teachers and prevent them from reflecting the true situation to the investigation team. In addition, Fang Zhengping also asked individual Youth League cadres to ask the League members to "stand firm" and say in front of the investigation team comrades that the school's "handling of the mailroom search incident was correct."

The Fengfeng Mining Area Party Committee should bear considerable responsibility for the chaotic situation in the Fengfeng Mining Area Industrial School developing to such a serious extent. It erroneously approved the school's punishment of students Zhou Biwei, Wei Yuanrui, and others. After the comrades of the Hebei Provincial Education Department and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Youth League reported the true situation to the Fengfeng Mining Area Party Committee, the Fengfeng Mining Area Party Committee still did not pay attention to the school's problems and sent Xue Shifang and others to the school to investigate. In order to resist the provincial inspection, Xue Shifang and others forced students Wei Yuanrui and Zhai Shiqin to admit arson, causing many difficulties for the higher-level inspectors in their work (it is now found that Wei Yuanrui and Zhai Shiqin did not commit arson).

Such lawless and undisciplined behavior of Fang Zhengping and other leading cadres must not be tolerated.

    峰峰矿区工业学校校长方正平乱“斗”学生
    据河北日报讯：峰峰矿区工业学校校长方正平等，违法乱纪，压制民主，错误地用“斗争”的办法处理学生问题，严重摧残了学生的身心；当上级党委派人前去检查时，又坚持错误，抗拒党委的检查，使该校的教育工作遭受了极大的损失。
    峰峰矿区工业学校在去年秋天开学时，从淮南、河北、西北等地保送来了一批学生，其中有一百七十八人是从淮南煤矿职业学校来的。当动员这批学生来校的时候，估计有困难，接领人便采用了强调物质条件优越的办法来动员学生，说：“到峰峰以后，每月有一百一十五斤米的助学金，每人一套棉衣。”但等学生们来校后，学校方面根据上级的指示，把助学金改成了一百斤米，棉衣也不发了。这样就引起了学生的不满。加上这些学生初到北方，生活不习惯，而在分科编班上也有些不合理的地方，他们就在思想上起了很大波动。这时学校领导方面理应对新同学进行教育，把问题说清楚，使他们能安心学习下去，但该校领导人员竟采取了官僚主义的态度，不闻不问。学生们很不满意。九月二十七日就发生了学生搜查收发室的事件。
    这件事是由淮南来的几个学生引起的。因为有些从淮南来的学生往家写信要棉衣，总不见回信，有的学生就怀疑是收发室把信扣下了。学生们这种怀疑是有某些根据的，因为在“三反”前，该校曾经任意检查过学生和教师们的信件。又有一次，学生沈友林看见收发员撕毁过信件（据收发员说是撕的自己的信件）。去年九月二十七日，原淮南同学周必慰（是个十六、七岁的孩子）等三人，商量给淮南煤矿职业学校写信，想反映自己对学校的不满情绪，但又怕被收发员扣留撕毁，周必慰就鼓动同学搜查了收发室。
    当周必慰等搜查收发室追问收发员撕信的情况时，学生们越聚越多，发现纸篓里有撕毁的信件（究竟是不是别人的私人信件还没有查明），这样，大家就都认为收发员撕信确是事实，再加上收发员平时工作态度不好，这些学生就要求处罚收发员。学生为此向教导主任张步瀛提出过两次报告（当时校长到北京开会，不在学校），张步瀛都没有注意。后来学生们嚷着把收发员推到教导处门口。张步瀛看到以后，有些惊慌失措，不敢向学生进行说服教育，制止这一错误行动，却根据学生的意见违法扣押了收发员，封闭了收发室。
    这一事件发生后，该校领导人员仍没有进行深入的调查研究，分析这一事件发生的原因，及时处理，却盲目地叫学生选代表处理这件事情。原淮南同学中有个叫张开友的，因在宿舍商量选代表时，和同学周庆魁发生争执，竟用剪刀把周庆魁的左臂刺伤。十月二日下午，原淮南的学生在院内分组传达学生代表会议的精神时，周必慰因为对学校这样解决问题不满，一时激怒，曾向院子里投了三个石子。十月四日，学校厕所里又发生失火事件（失火的原因，正在追查）。根据这些连续发生的事件，该校领导人员就武断地认为这是“少数坏分子的有计划的活动”。峰峰煤矿党委宣传部秘书薛世芳和矿务局人事处教育科长李化一，在进行调查时，没有深入了解实际情况，就偏信了校方的意见。薛世芳等根据厕所失火的时候，有的学生看到好像是学生翟士钦从厕所出来，又根据翟士钦平常玩过火，就用四人轮流逼供的办法，逼着翟士钦承认，翟士钦被逼不过，承认是和魏元瑞同谋。这样，在校长方正平（这时他已回到学校）和薛世芳、李化一等主持下，完全违反党和人民政府的教育政策，擅自召开了所谓揭露“九月二十七日事件真相大会”，企图用对待反革命分子的办法来处理学生内部的问题。在会议上，方正平说：“这个事件是有组织的非法行动，所有主动的或被动的参加这次事件的人，都要向人民坦白，重新作人。”薛世芳说：“这个事件是坏分子拉拢落后分子煽动群众造成的。”会前方正平还召开了党员、青年团员干部会议，号召他们带头坦白，并布置每班选举三个坦白的人。还布置学生在会场上互相监视，在会场外并设有岗哨。在这种情况下，学生们写了检举条子达一千多件，被迫上台坦白的共有二十四人，连会后写坦白书的共有六十多人。坦白的同学一般都是谈些琐碎事情，给自己扣上个“反动”帽子。原淮南学生魏元瑞曾上台坦白三次，都被认为坦白不彻底，他最后只好承认“非法组织宣传组、鼓动组”
    （事实上并无此事）。翟士钦因坦白不出放火事实来，在台上被罚站一个钟头，直到累得流汗才叫下台。在这个会上，还用“集体照相”、“个别照相”的办法污辱学生的人格。即只要有人提出某几个同学或某个同学有嫌疑，就叫他们集体地或个别地到台上站着给大家看。
    这次坦白检举大会一直开了三天。最后，李化一作了一个诽谤学生的结论，说学生中“有封建集团，各霸一方，诬告领导，这是丧尽天良、卑鄙无耻、立场不稳、反党反人民的行为”。会后他们还向峰峰煤矿党委会写了一个假报告，说：“会议开得很好，收获很大……”党委会偏听偏信了他们的报告，不仅没有发觉上述极端错误的行为，反而错误地批准了该校开除学生周必慰、给学生魏元瑞等人记过处分的决定。
    这一事件在学生中造成了极坏的影响，有很多学生想脱离这个学校。他们曾派出代表向峰峰煤矿党委会反映情况，但被方正平阻止了。他们又向河北省人民政府教育厅写信进行控诉。后来华北行政委员会、中共中央华北局、中国新民主主义青年团华北工作委员会、中共河北省委、河北省人民政府、中国新民主主义青年团河北省委员会协同中共峰峰矿区党委会、峰峰矿区人民政府、青年团峰峰矿区委员会等组织调查组，对此事进行了五次调查，终于弄清了事件的真相。
    在调查中，发现峰峰矿区工业学校校长方正平有压制批评、压制民主、违法乱纪的行为。他在担任校长和党的支部书记的过程中，经常以“老干部”自居，想把学校变成自己的“小天下”。他曾公开地向教师们说：“给报纸写稿必须经支部审查，学校盖章，否则报社不登。”他还说：“校长要摘掉一个教员很容易。”去年秋季开学时，同学张琦珉因为曾代表同学们向校方提出过建议，向河北省人民政府教育厅写过信，就触怒了方正平，因此在这次坦白检举大会开始以前，方正平不仅在党、青年团干部会上，说张琦珉“坦白不彻底，不够党员资格”，并毫无理由地叫张琦珉上台去坦白。张琦珉由于在精神上受到摧残，现在已患重病休息了。远在一九五一年秋天，学生田洪琛、王如深因对学校表示不满，学校方面便把他们扣押了一天，开除了。一九五二年春天，学生张家珣也因对学校不满，方正平就召开全体师生大会把他“斗争”以后开除了。更严重的是：该校一位教师丢了东西，方正平不问青红皂白，把工友陈再会抓到派出所扣了二十天，后来查清是另一个车夫偷的。
    上级机关到该校去进行调查时，方正平竟百般阻挠，企图不让上级机关查清事实的真相。去年十月间，当河北省人民政府教育厅和青年团河北省委派人前去调查时，方正平因事外出，他便写信叫该校秘书高福珊注意调查人员的活动。去年十一月间进行第四次调查时，中共中央华北局也派人参加了，方正平指使辅导员张文丽（青年团员）监视调查人员的行动，叫张文丽把和调查人员接近过的教师的名字记下来，向他汇报。同时还指使张文丽在教师中间散布“在搜查收发室事件的处理上，峰峰煤矿党委和河北省调查人员的意见不一致”的谣言，企图迷惑教师不让他们向调查组反映真实情况。此外，方正平还叫个别的青年团的干部要求团员们“站稳立场”，在调查组同志面前说学校那样“处理搜查收发室事件是对的”。
    峰峰矿区工业学校的混乱状况所以发展到这样严重的程度，峰峰煤矿党委要负相当的责任。它错误地批准了学校对学生周必慰、魏元瑞等人的处分。而在河北省教育厅及青年团河北省委的同志把真实情况向峰峰矿区党委反映以后，峰峰矿区党委仍然对该校的问题没有加以注意，派了薛世芳等人到学校调查；而薛世芳等人为了对抗省的检查，又逼迫学生魏元瑞、翟士钦承认放火，给上级检查人员在工作上造成了很多困难（现在查明魏元瑞、翟士钦没有放火）。
    方正平等领导干部的这种目无组织，目无法纪的违法乱纪行为，是决不能容许的。
