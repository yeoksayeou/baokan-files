    Northeast China's Horse Population Exceeds Historical High
    In recent years, the breeding of horses in rural Northeast China has been rapid, preparing favorable conditions for improving the level of agricultural production and cultivation. The current number of horses in Northeast China has exceeded the historical peak by 17.1%. In Heilongjiang Province, a major agricultural area, the number of horses has more than doubled since 1949. The average area of cultivated land per horse in the entire region has decreased from 6 *xiang* (1 *xiang* equals 15 *mu*, or approximately 2.47 acres) and 2.7 *mu* to 3 *xiang* and 1.3 *mu*. This allows for more horses to be used for intensive cultivation and improved farming techniques. Last year, plowing with horses three or more times was common practice in Northeast China.
    People's governments at all levels in Northeast China attach great importance to horse breeding. The region currently has three large-scale Soviet stud farms and six stud farms, and 109 breeding stations, actively engaged in breeding fine horse breeds and improving local horse breeds. Last year alone, the region produced more than 4,000 excellent foals. While vigorously breeding horses, various localities have also trained a group of new veterinarians and transformed more than 4,000 old veterinarians. In carrying out the patriotic livestock increase movement, they helped farmers improve breeding methods and improve and rebuild horse sheds.
    In order to meet the needs of agricultural production with the large-scale use of new horse-drawn farm implements in the future, rural Northeast China will vigorously carry out horse breeding. Heilongjiang Province plans to increase the number of horses by 100,000 this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Hunan and Hubei Fishermen to Begin Catching Fry
    In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the weather is warm and the wind is gentle, and fish eggs in tributaries such as the Xiang River and Han River, and in lakes and marshes have hatched into fry. In order to supply the needs of freshwater fish farming in inland rivers and lakes across the country, fishermen in Hunan and Hubei provinces will begin catching fry after Grain Rain (April 20th).
    Hunan and Hubei provinces are the main producing areas of freshwater fry in China. The fry produced in Hubei Province each year, in addition to supplying the province's more than 920,000 *mu* of lake aquaculture, can also supply the freshwater aquaculture needs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Fujian provinces. Xiangyin, Wangcheng, Xiangtan and other major fry producing counties in Hunan Province produced more than 330 million fry last year. There are more than 30 types of fry, including carp, grass carp, and silver carp. In addition to supplying the needs of fish farming in the province, they are also sold to Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces. This year, Hubei Province plans to catch 2 billion fry, and Hunan Province plans to catch 400 million fry. With the support of the people's government, fishermen in the two provinces are actively preparing to catch fry. Fishermen in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, have added more than 450 new nets this year; farmers in Xiangtan County have also organized more than 30 mutual aid teams to prepare for catching fry. Wooden boats from Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, and Jiangsu Province, and other places that have come to Hubei Province to purchase fry have arrived at the riverside of Wuhan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The Role of Agricultural Technology Guidance Stations
    The agricultural technology guidance station in Hailun, Heilongjiang Province, has expanded its technical guidance scope this year from the original 11 new-style horse-drawn farm implement groups (cooperatives) to 27 groups (cooperatives).
    The spring wheat fields of each group (cooperative) total more than 250 *xiang* (1 *xiang* equals 15 *mu*, or approximately 2.47 acres). Under the guidance of the Hailun Agricultural Technology Guidance Station, all of them will be flat-sown and densely planted this year, with an average planned yield of more than 12 *shi* (1 *shi* equals 450 *jin*, or approximately 500 lbs) per *xiang*, and a planned yield of more than 20 *shi* per *xiang* on large tracts of land. The seeds used for sowing are "Kehua" wheat and the local "Da Qing Mang" excellent varieties. These seeds must be wind-selected and screened before sowing, and germination tests must be carried out, requiring a germination rate of over 95%; at the same time, seed dressing with seresan (at a rate of 0.2%) or copper oxychloride should be done to prevent wheat bunt and smut, and cold water or warm water soaking of seeds should be implemented with emphasis to prevent wheat smut. On land with abundant manure and sufficient fertility, the row spacing should be shortened, the sowing width should be increased, and flat sowing should be carried out using a criss-cross method, or dense sowing should be carried out at 7.5 cm (2.5 inch row spacing), requiring a seedling density of 9 million plants per *xiang*.
    Based on the experience of increased production obtained from large-scale continuous cooperative operations last year, the Hailun Agricultural Technology Guidance Station will also guide farmers to carry out plowing, harrowing, and compaction at the same time, so as to prevent drought and protect seedlings.

    Successful Trial of Automobile Towing Method
    The Transportation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Communications has successfully tested the advanced Soviet highway transportation experience - the automobile towing method - at the Tianjin Automobile Transportation Company. The automobile towing method involves towing a trailer behind a fully loaded freight car. According to the calculation of the test results, the implementation of this method can increase the automobile transportation capacity by 33% to 50% and reduce costs by more than 19%. The speed of travel on flat roads is the same as that of a single car. Some difficulties were encountered during the experiment. For example, the pressure on the trailer was too great when going downhill, which could easily lead to danger. After collective research by the employees of the company's maintenance plant, a drawbar brake was added to the trailer and connected to the foot brake of the front car. As long as the driver steps on the foot brake, the trailer can stop accordingly, ensuring driving safety. Now Guizhou, Henan, Shandong, and other places are also testing this advanced transportation method. The success of the Guizhou Provincial Transportation Company's test on the slopes of Guiyang to Chongqing further proves that the automobile towing method is equally applicable to mountain slopes.

    Produce More Bricks, Produce Good Bricks!
    In order to supply enough red bricks for basic construction, the workers of the Northeast Local State-owned Yonghua Kiln No. 1 Branch broke the convention of "starting work after Qingming" and began producing semi-finished products on March 27th. After winter training, the workers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. After receiving the notice to change the specifications of red bricks, they modified the brick molds and repaired the machines. In order to ensure quality, they also changed the past practice of digging mud as needed, and prepared the mud and sand needed for the whole year in the first quarter. Now that the finished product department has not yet started work, the workers are learning from the lessons of always having a surplus of semi-finished products in previous years, which could not balance production, and are actively learning advanced firing methods and the advanced experience of the Soviet brick and tile industry.

    Created a Quick Training Method for Fitters
    Ma Zixian and Zheng Xiang, instructors of the fitter department of the technical training class of the Southwest State-owned Factory 203, absorbed the basic spirit of Peng Songfu's quick training method for basic lathe technology, summarized their more than ten years of practical fitting experience, and created a "quick training method for basic fitting technology." Fitting technology is relatively complicated. In the past, people described the difficulty of learning fitting by saying: "Three years for lathe operators, ten years for fitters." The creation of this teaching method by Ma Zixian and Zheng Xiang provides a good way to master the complex basic fitting technology. Ma Zixian and Zheng Xiang used this teaching method in the fitter department of the factory's technical training class. As a result, after three months of study, 64 students learned the basic fitting knowledge and operation methods that would have taken more than two years to learn in the past.
    The quick training method for basic fitting technology divides fitting technology into seven topics in order of increasing difficulty, and all topics are taught in two stages. Six topics are learned in the blitz stage, which takes about one month; the seventh topic is learned in the consolidation stage, which takes two months. When teaching, Ma Zixian and Zheng Xiang, on the one hand, combined technology with political education and lectures with practice according to Peng Songfu's quick training method for basic lathe technology, and paid special attention to teaching key points and tricks; on the other hand, they also adopted the method of centralized lectures, decentralized practice, and division of labor and rotation during practice. This allows each group to accept the experience of the groups that have already practiced, avoiding detours, and also overcomes the difficulty of insufficient tool allocation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Spring Silkworm Cocoons Collected in Guangdong Province
    In Guangdong Province, spring silkworm cocoons are being collected, with each silkworm seed producing about 30 *jin* of cocoons. The climate in Guangdong Province is suitable for silkworm rearing, and six to seven crops can be harvested in a year. For the first crop this year, farmers in various localities, under the guidance of the sericulture technical guidance stations of the people's government, have generally adopted the Yingwenhua Ten crossbred silkworms from East China and promoted the advanced Soviet experience of "sparse nests" for breeding, which has greatly improved the yield and quality of silkworm cocoons.

    东北马匹超过历史上最高数量
    几年来东北农村的马匹繁殖很快，为提高农业生产耕作水平准备了有利条件。现在东北全区的马匹数量，已超过历史上最高数量百分之十七点一。主要农业区黑龙江省的马匹，比一九四九年增加了一倍多。全区平均每匹马所负担的耕地面积由过去的六垧（每垧合十五市亩）二亩七分，减少到三垧一亩三分；这就可以把更多的马用来精耕细作，改进耕作技术。去年东北各地都用马拉犁?地三遍以上。
    东北各地人民政府非常重视马匹的繁殖工作。全区现有三个规模较大的苏联种马繁殖场和六个种马场、一百零九个配种站，积极地进行繁殖优良马种和改良民间马种的工作。全区仅去年就产优良马驹四千多匹。各地在大力作好繁殖马匹的同时，还培养了一批新兽医和改造了四千多名旧兽医。他们在开展爱国增畜运动中，帮助农民改进了饲养方法，改善和修盖了马棚。
    为使今后大量使用新式马拉农具适应农业生产的需要，东北农村将要大力进行繁殖马匹的工作。黑龙江省今年就计划增殖十万匹马。（新华社）
    湖南湖北渔民将开始打捞鱼苗
    长江中游日暖风和，湘江、汉水等支流和湖沼的鱼卵已孵化成鱼苗。为供应各地内河、湖泊淡水养鱼事业的需要，湖南、湖北两省渔民即将在谷雨节
    （四月二十日）后开始打捞鱼苗。
    湖南、湖北两省是我国淡水鱼苗的主要产区。湖北省每年出产的鱼苗，除供本省九十二万多亩湖泊养殖外，还可供应江苏、浙江、河南、江西、四川和福建等省淡水养殖的需要。湖南省主要鱼苗产区湘阴、望城、湘潭等县，去年共产鱼苗三亿三千多万尾。鱼苗有鲤鱼、鲩鱼、鲢鱼三十多种，除供应本省养鱼所需外，还外销到四川、广东、广西等省。今年湖北省计划打捞二十亿尾鱼苗，湖南省计划打捞四亿尾鱼苗。两省渔民在人民政府扶助下，正积极作打捞鱼苗的准备。湖南省湘阴县渔民今年新添了四百五十多个捞子；湘潭县农民还组织了三十多个互助组，准备打捞鱼苗。从洞庭湖、鄱阳湖和江苏省等处赶到湖北省采购鱼苗的木船，已开抵武汉市的江边。（新华社）
    农业技术指导站的作用
    黑龙江省海伦农业技术指导站，今年的技术指导范围，已从原来的十一个新式马拉农具组（社）扩大到二十七个组（社）。
    各组（社）春小麦田共有二百五十余垧（每垧合十五市亩），在海伦农业技术指导站的指导下，今年全部进行平播密植，计划每垧平均产麦十二石以上
    （每石四百五十斤），大片土地上计划每垧收二十石以上。播种用的种籽都是“克华”小麦和当地
    “大青芒”优良品种。这些种籽在播种前都要进行风选和筛选，做好发芽试验，要求发芽率达百分之九十五以上；同时还要用赛力散拌种（千分之二的配合量），或王铜拌种，防治小麦腥黑穗病和有重点地实行冷水、温汤浸种，防治小麦黑穗病。粪肥多，地力足的土地，要缩短行距，增加播幅，实行十字交叉法平播，或七·五公分（行距二寸半）密播，每垧要求保苗九百万棵。
    海伦农业技术指导站根据去年大片连续结合作业获得增产的经验，还要指导农民进行随耕随耙随镇压，作到防旱保苗。（王锦威）汽车拖带法试行成功
    中央交通部运输局在天津汽车运输公司试验苏联公路运输的先进经验——汽车拖带法，已经成功。汽车拖带法就是在满载的运货汽车后面，拖带一辆挂车。根据试验结果计算，实行这种方法，能够增加汽车运输能力百分之三十三到百分之五十，降低成本百分之十九以上。在平道上驰行，和独行汽车的速度一样。在试验过程中，曾经遇到一些困难。例如下坡时挂车的压力太大，容易发生危险。后经该公司保养厂职工集体研究，在挂车上加装拉杆刹车，和前面汽车的脚刹车联在一起，只要司机一踏脚刹车，挂车就能跟着停止，保证了行车安全。现在贵州、河南、山东等地也都在试验这个先进的运输方法，贵州省运输公司在贵阳至重庆的坡道上试验成功，更证明了汽车拖带法在山区坡道上也同样适用。
    多造砖，造好砖！
    东北地方国营永华窑业一分厂的职工们，为了供给基本建设以足够的红砖，打破了“过了清明再开工”的惯例，在三月二十七日就开始生产半成品了。工人们经过冬季训练之后，生产积极性普遍提高。当接到改变红砖规格的通知以后，就改好了砖模子，修理好了机器。为保证质量，还改变了过去现用泥现挖的办法，在第一季度就把全年需用的泥和砂子准备好了。现在成品部暂时还没有开工，工人们接受往年总是半成品过剩，不能平衡生产的教训，正积极学习先进的烧火法和苏联砖瓦业的先进经验。
    创造了钳工技术速成法
    西南国营二零三厂技工训练班钳工部指导员马子显、郑祥，吸取彭松福车工基本技术速成教学法的基本精神，总结他们十几年来的钳工实际操作经验，创造了“钳工基本技术速成教学法”。钳工技术是比较复杂的。过去人们形容学钳工的困难说：“车工三年，钳工十年”。马子显、郑祥的这个教学法的创造，为掌握复杂的钳工基本技术提供了一个很好的办法。马子显、郑祥用这个教学法在该厂技工训练班钳工部实验结果，六十四个学员经过三个月的学习后，就学会了在过去需要两年以上的时间才能学会的钳工基本知识和操作方法。
    钳工基本技术速成教学法把钳工技术按由浅入深的次序分为七个课题，全部课题分两个阶段教学。在突击阶段学习六个课题，约需一个月；巩固阶段再学习第七个课题，用两个月。马子显、郑祥教学时，一方面根据彭松福车工基本技术速成教学法的办法，把技术和政治教育相结合、讲课和实习相结合，并特别注意教关键，教窍门；另一方面又采用集中讲课，分散实习，和实习时分工轮换的办法，这样就使各小组接受已经实习过的小组的经验，少走弯路，同时也克服了工具不够分配的困难。

    广东省春蚕收茧
    广东省春蚕收茧，每张蚕种产茧达三十斤左右。广东省气候适宜养蚕，一年可以收六造到七造。今年第一造，各地农民在人民政府的蚕桑技术指导站指导下，普遍采用了华东的瀛文华十交杂种蚕，推行了苏联的“疏窝”养育先进经验，使蚕茧产量、质量大大提高。（新华社）
