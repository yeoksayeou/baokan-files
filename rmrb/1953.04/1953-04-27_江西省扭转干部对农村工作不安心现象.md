Jiangxi Province reverses the phenomenon of cadres feeling unsettled about rural work.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly devised methods to resolve the contradiction between the large-scale transfer of cadres from rural work and the current spring plowing production tasks, fully implemented the central government's instructions on spring plowing production, and made spring plowing production the overriding central task in rural areas.

This year, when Jiangxi Province transitioned from ending land reform to spring plowing production, it coincided with the need to transfer a large number of rural work cadres to industrial construction posts. On average, each county in the province had to transfer several county-level and district-level cadres. As a result, some rural work cadres mistakenly believed that rural work was "insignificant" and "unpromising" in national economic construction, and they requested transfers, causing ideological instability. Some cadres from intellectual backgrounds emphasized their lack of agricultural production knowledge and wanted to change careers and move to the city. Cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds also wanted to switch to industry, but felt they lacked education and requested to study. They all relaxed or even abandoned their leadership over spring plowing production. The county head of Linchuan County once "turned a deaf ear to production matters, focusing solely on studying science and mathematics." After the land reform review work ended in some areas of Shangrao Prefecture, cadres were no longer sent to the countryside, simply waiting for transfer. Gong Zongfa, the secretary of the Seventh District Party Committee of Yiyang, neglected both going to the countryside to lead production and attending to the needs of the masses who came to him to discuss production because he was waiting for a transfer. The masses were very dissatisfied with this situation.

In mid-March, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China focused on studying this issue and proposed specific methods to resolve it.

First, the "details" of cadre transfers were clearly explained at each level, so that everyone had a clear understanding, in order to minimize ideological fluctuations. When transferring cadres, a method of transferring and replacing simultaneously was adopted to ensure that organizations at all levels were sound and fully staffed. The province appropriately retained the leading backbone of several key counties to maintain tradition, train cadres, create experience, and guide the province. When explaining the "details" of cadre transfers at each level, it was emphasized that all cadres must fully demonstrate a high sense of political responsibility to the Party and the people's revolutionary cause. Not only should those who remain adhere to their work posts, but those who are to be transferred must also conscientiously do their current work before the transfer, and must not allow current work to suffer losses due to waiting for the transfer. After doing this, the cadres responded one after another: "We are at ease now that this is explained clearly."

Second, the Provincial Party Committee compiled and printed the important instructions of the Central Committee, Central South Bureau, and the Provincial Party Committee on current agricultural production and distributed them to cadres engaged in rural work, one copy per person, as required reading. In their studies, cadres in various places compared their own thoughts with the spirit of the documents, criticized the one-sided industrialization viewpoint, reviewed the generalized leadership style, and made reasonable arrangements for their work in April, greatly strengthening their leadership over agricultural production.

Third, work was rationally arranged, work deployments were unified, and efforts were concentrated on leading spring plowing production work. Based on the "Instructions on Spring Plowing Production to Party Committees at All Levels" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and combined with the specific conditions of the province, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee made the following arrangements for current work: Spring plowing production was to be regarded as the overriding central task in rural areas; democratic reforms in aquatic product areas would be suspended for the time being, except for the major rivers and lakes such as the Gan River, Fu River, and Poyang Lake; all cadre training times would be postponed until May; literacy campaigns, the banning of secret societies, the establishment of militia base groups, and road construction work in individual areas would all be suspended during the spring plowing production period; all statistics, investigations, typical experiments, inspections, and meetings of various departments, etc., would be unified and controlled by the county party committees, which would make unified arrangements, and would not be issued directly to districts and townships.

Fourth, inspections were strengthened to promote leading cadres in various prefectures and counties to personally go deep into key areas, deep into the masses, and deep into the fields, to summarize the production experience of the masses, and to focus on guiding the masses to adopt advanced technologies. On March 16, more than 60 cadres were drawn from the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government to form inspection teams, led by the Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee and the Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, to go to various prefectures in six groups to inspect spring plowing production. Under the drive and supervision of the Provincial Party Committee, the six prefectures in the province drew a total of 308 cadres, led by members of the prefectural committees, to go to the countryside to inspect production. Counties throughout the province also drew cadres one after another, led by responsible cadres of the county party committees, to go deep into the grassroots to lead production movements. On April 10, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry again drew a large number of cadres to conduct a second inspection. During the inspection, impetuous and rash situations discovered in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and in the promotion of advanced experience were promptly corrected.

At present, the entire province has entered the most intense period of spring plowing and sowing. In the warmer areas of southern Jiangxi, as of early April, the sowing of rice paddies generally reached about 80 percent. In spring plowing and sowing, many areas, with Party members, League members, and labor models as the backbone, and labor mutual aid organizations as the foundation, united and led individual farmers to launch short-term chain-linked patriotic production increase competitions between households, groups, villages, and townships. In order to strengthen specific guidance, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee decided to focus on Pingxiang and Nanchang as key counties, and regularly organized inspection teams to go deep into the grassroots to summarize experience, correct deviations, and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to guide the production movement to continuously develop in a healthy and in-depth manner.

    江西省扭转干部对农村工作不安心现象
    中共江西省委及时设法解决了大批抽调农村工作干部和当前春耕生产任务的矛盾，全力贯彻中央关于春耕生产的指示，使春耕生产成为农村中压倒一切的中心工作。
    今年江西省由结束土地改革转入春耕生产时，正碰上要抽调大批农村工作干部转到工业建设的岗位上去，全省每县平均都要抽调好几个县区级干部。这样一来，一部分农村工作干部就错误地认为在国家经济建设中，农村工作已“无足轻重”、“没啥搞头”了，纷纷要求调动，思想动荡不安。一些知识分子出身的干部，强调自己不懂农业生产知识，想转业，想进城。工农出身的干部，也想转工业；但又感到自己缺少文化，要求学习。他们都放松甚至放弃了对春耕生产的领导。临川县县长曾一度“两耳不闻生产事，一心钻研数理化”。上饶专区部分地区，结束土地改革复查工作以后，就不再派干部下乡了，尽坐着等调动。弋阳七区区委书记巩宗法，因坐等转业，不仅不下乡领导生产，连群众找上门来谈生产，也都不管了。群众对这种情形十分不满。
    三月中旬，中共江西省委就着重地研究了这个问题，提出了解决这个问题的具体办法。
    首先，逐级交代清楚调动干部的“底”，使大家心中有数，以尽量减少思想波动。在抽调干部的时候，采取边抽边补办法，以保证各级组织健全，满员满额。全省适当地保留了几个重点县的领导骨干，以保持传统，培养干部，创造经验，指导全省。在逐级交代调动干部的“底”的时候，强调指出：所有干部必须充分发挥对党对人民革命事业的高度的政治责任感。不仅留下的人要安守自己的工作岗位，要调的在未调前也必须认真作好当前的工作，不得因坐待调动而使当前工作遭受损失。这样做了以后，干部们纷纷反映：这样讲清楚，我们就安心了。
    其次，省委汇印了中央、中南及省委有关当前农业生产的重要指示，发给从事农村工作的干部，人手一册，作为必读文件。各地干部在学习中都以文件的精神对照自己的思想，批判了片面工业化观点，检查了一般化的领导作风，并对四月份的工作作了合理安排，大大加强了对农业生产的领导。
    第三，合理安排工作，统一工作部署，集中力量领导春耕生产工作。江西省委根据中共中央“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”，结合本省的具体情况，对当前工作作了如下安排：把春耕生产作为当前农村压倒一切的中心工作；对水产区的民主改革，当前除赣江、抚河、鄱阳湖等几个主要河湖以外，其他地区暂停；推迟一切干部训练时间，到五月再开始；扫除文盲、取缔会道门、建立民兵基干团及个别地方的修公路工作，春耕生产期间一律停止；凡有关统计、调查、典型试验、检查、各部门会议等等，都要由县委统一掌握，统一布置，不准直接下达区乡。
    第四，加强检查，推动各专区、县领导干部亲自深入重点，深入群众，深入田间，总结群众的生产经验，重点指导群众采用先进技术。三月十六日，从省委和省人民政府抽调六十多名干部组织检查组，由省委农村工作部部长、省人民政府农林厅厅长等率领，分六路到各专区检查春耕生产。在省委的带动、督导下，全省六个专区共抽调三百零八名干部，由地委委员率领，分头下乡检查生产。全省各县也都先后抽调了干部，由县委负责干部领导，深入底层，领导生产运动。四月十日省委、省农林厅又抽调了大批干部进行第二次检查。在检查中，及时纠正了在互助合作运动中和推广先进经验中发现的急躁冒进的情形。
    目前全省已经进入最紧张的春耕播种时期。赣南气候较暖的地区，四月初，播种秧田一般已达百分之八十左右。在春耕播种中，许多地区以党团员、劳动模范为骨干，劳动互助组织为基础，团结并带动单干农民，展开了户与户、组与组、村与村、乡与乡间的短期连环的爱国增产竞赛运动。为了加强具体指导，江西省委决定以萍乡、南昌为重点县，并经常组织检查组深入基层总结经验，纠正偏向，定期举行检查评比，指导生产运动不断健康深入地向前发展。    （陈健）
