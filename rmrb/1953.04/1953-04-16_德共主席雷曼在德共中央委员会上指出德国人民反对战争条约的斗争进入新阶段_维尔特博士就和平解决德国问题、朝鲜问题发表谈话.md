Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 14th: The German News Agency reported that the Central Committee of the German Communist Party held a meeting in Düsseldorf on April 12th. The Chairman of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, delivered a report on "The Struggle of German Patriots Against the Implementation of the Bonn and Paris War Treaties and the Tasks of the German Communist Party."

Reimann emphasized: "Adenauer's gun-toting policy is not only directed against the democratic and peace-loving people of the East, but also against the people of Western European countries, especially France. But Adenauer's policy primarily threatens the survival of the German people."

Reimann pointed out: Under these circumstances, increasingly broad strata of the German people, mainly the working class, have united to fight against Adenauer's war policy. He said: The struggle against the Bonn and Paris war treaties has entered a new stage, and now this struggle must be carried out with redoubled force. Reimann condemned the traitorous role played by Adenauer's party and the right-wing leaders of the German Social Democratic Party. He called on the members of the Social Democratic Party to learn from historical facts, unite with the Communist Party, and jointly fight for democratic rights and freedoms, against the danger of war, against the implementation of the Bonn and Paris treaties, and for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 12th: On April 11th, Berlin's democratic newspapers published an interview given by former German Chancellor and Chairman of the German Movement for Unity, Peace and Freedom, Dr. Wirth, to a reporter from the German News Agency.

Dr. Wirth answered a question about the reply from General Chuikov, Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany, to the German Movement for Unity, Peace and Freedom. The Federation had written to the High Commissioners of the United States, Britain, and France, and the Soviet Control Commission, requesting a four-power meeting to seek a peaceful solution to the German question. In his reply, Chuikov emphasized that the request to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to convene a four-power conference to plan a peace treaty with Germany to restore German unity was completely consistent with the Soviet government's views on this issue.

Dr. Wirth said that General Chuikov's letter endorsed our proposal. We believe that this letter confirms our view that the path to agreement between the major powers is open.

Dr. Wirth continued, needless to say, this letter has received great attention from the West German public and the Western world, although in West Germany, some initially tried to conceal the letter from the public.

Dr. Wirth then spoke about the German unification movement, saying that the mass movement to strive for a unified Germany has become very strong. It is no exaggeration to say that this movement represents the will of the majority of the German people and will promote the realization of this will.

When commenting on West Germany's comments on the peaceful steps taken by China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union on the Korean question, Dr. Wirth said that, as a member of the German Movement for Unity, Peace and Freedom, he applauded these peaceful steps. He said that these new steps by the governments of China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union proved that they were sincerely striving to realize the ardent desire of the people of all countries for peace.

Dr. Wirth also answered the question of the tasks of the German unification movement in the current situation. He said that although the Bonn and Paris treaties have been approved by the Bonn Federal Parliament, they still have no legal force for the German people. He said that the German people must fight against all forms of West German re-militarization, they must strive to convene talks between the people of East and West Germany to draft proposals for the four major powers, and demand the convening of a four-power conference so that the German people can elect a pan-German National Assembly by free, secret, and equal elections to establish an independent, democratic, and peace-loving government.

    德共主席雷曼在德共中央委员会上指出德国人民反对战争条约的斗争进入新阶段
    维尔特博士就和平解决德国问题、朝鲜问题发表谈话
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十四日讯：德意志通讯社报道：德国共产党中央委员会于四月十二日在杜塞尔多夫举行会议。德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼作了关于“德国爱国人士反对实行波恩和巴黎战争条约的斗争与德国共产党的任务”的报告。
    雷曼强调指出：“阿登纳摆弄枪杆的政策不仅是对付东部民主和爱好和平的人民的，同时也是对付西欧国家，特别是法国的人民的。但是阿登纳的政策首先是威胁德国人民的生存。”
    雷曼指出：在这种情况下，日益广泛的阶层的德国人民，主要的是工人阶级，已团结起来进行反对阿登纳战争政策的斗争。他说：反对波恩和巴黎战争条约的斗争已经进入了新阶段，现在必须以加倍的力量来进行这个斗争。雷曼谴责阿登纳的党和德国社会民主党右翼领袖所起的卖国作用，他要求社会民主党的党员从历史的事实中取得教训；并与共产党团结起来，共同为争取民主权利和自由、反对战争危险、反对实行波恩与巴黎条约而斗争，为争取建立统一、爱好和平与民主的德国而斗争。
      【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：四月十一日，柏林民主报纸登载了前德国总理、德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会主席维尔特博士对德意志通讯社记者的谈话。
    维尔特博士回答了关于苏联驻德管制委员会主席崔可夫将军给德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会的复信的问题。联合会曾致函美、英、法三国高级专员和苏联管制委员会，要求举行四国会谈以求得和平解决德国问题。崔可夫在他的复信中着重指出，向苏联、美国、英国及法国政府所提出的召开四国会议以筹划对德和约从而恢复德国统一的要求，与苏联政府在这个问题上所抱的观点是完全一致的。
    维尔特博士说，崔可夫陆军上将的这封信赞成我们的建议。我们认为这封信证实了我们的见解，就是说，大国间取得协议的道路是开着的。
    维尔特博士继续说，不用说，这封信受到西德公众及西方世界的极大注意，虽然在西德起初曾有人力图向公众隐瞒起这封信。
    维尔特博士接着谈到德国的统一运动说，争取统一德国的群众性运动已变得很强大。可以一点也不夸张地说，这个运动代表大多数德国人民的意志，并且将促使这个意志实现。
    在谈到关于西德对中、朝、苏三国在朝鲜问题上所采取的和平步骤的评论时，维尔特博士说，他以德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会的一员的资格为这些和平步骤而欢呼。他说，中、朝、苏三国政府的这些新步骤证明了它们是真诚地争取实现世界各国人民对和平的殷切希望的。
    维尔特博士并且回答了关于德国统一运动在目前情况下的任务的问题，他说，波恩及巴黎条约虽然已为波恩联邦议院所批准，它们对于德国人民仍然是没有什么法律上的力量的。他说，德国人民必须为反对一切形式的西德重新军国主义化而斗争，他们必须努力争取召开东西德人民之间的会谈以草拟给四大国的建议，要求召开四国会议，使德国人民能用自由、秘密与平等选举的方法选出全德国民议会，建立一个独立、民主与爱好和平的政府。
