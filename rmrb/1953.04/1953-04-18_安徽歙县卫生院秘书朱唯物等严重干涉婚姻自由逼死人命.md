Editor's Note: The case of Zhu Weiwu, secretary of She County Health Center in Anhui Province, and others interfering with freedom of marriage, illegally interrogating and extorting confessions, and forcing people to death is completely intolerable. The Anhui Provincial People's Supervision Committee is currently handling this case, and it is absolutely necessary to severely punish these criminals.

Zhu Weiwu, Secretary of She County Health Center in Anhui Province, and Others Seriously Interfered with Freedom of Marriage, Forcing People to Death

Zhu Weiwu, secretary of She County Health Center in Anhui Province, Zhang Jinhui, director of the hospital, Zhong Shengming, deputy section chief of the Personnel Section of the County People's Government, and others interfered with the freedom of marriage of Jiang Lili, assistant nurse at Sanyang District Health Center in She County, illegally interrogated and extorted confessions, causing Jiang Lili to commit suicide by jumping into a well.

While Jiang Lili was working at the Sanyang District Health Center, she fell in love with Zhao Lipin, the acting director of the center. During their relationship, Zhao Lipin prescribed medicine for Jiang Lili beyond the prescribed system without approval from higher authorities, which caused dissatisfaction among some cadres in the center. After this situation was reported to the County Health Center, the County People's Government decided to transfer Zhao Lipin to the county for introspection, to be handled by Zhong Shengming, deputy section chief of the Personnel Section of the County People's Government. When handling this incident, Zhong Shengming did not conduct correct ideological education for Zhao Lipin, but focused on investigating whether he and Jiang Lili had engaged in sexual relations. County Magistrate Liu Wenzhou was aware of these practices. By late October of last year, Zhao Lipin refused to continue his introspection. At this time, Zhong Shengming spoke with Zhang Jinhui, director of the County Health Center, asking the Health Center to be responsible for questioning Jiang Lili. Thereupon, Zhang Jinhui and Zhu Weiwu, the secretary of the hospital, decided to transfer Jiang Lili to the county for introspection. After Jiang Lili was transferred to the County Health Center, Zhu Weiwu illegally interrogated and extorted confessions from her, often dragging her out of bed in the middle of the night to question her, forcing her to admit that she had been raped by Zhao Lipin. When Jiang Lili denied it, Zhu Weiwu threatened her: "If you don't confess, I'll have a doctor examine you, expel you, and put you in jail!" Under such threats, Jiang Lili was forced to fabricate a confession on November 8: "Zhao Lipin gave me sleeping pills. After I took them, I was unable to resist and was raped by him." After obtaining this "confession," Zhu Weiwu immediately handed it over to Zhong Shengming. Afterwards, the county government decided to issue a county-wide circular. After Zhao Lipin learned of this, he wrote a report to County Magistrate Liu Wenzhou, requesting that the facts be clarified. However, Liu Wenzhou completely ignored Zhao Lipin's report. Zhong Shengming continued to demand that Zhao Lipin reflect based on Jiang Lili's "confession." Helpless, Zhao Lipin wrote a confession on November 10 and then attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills, but was rescued by the hospital. However, the county leaders not only did not take Zhao Lipin's suicide seriously, but absurdly decided: "Zhao Lipin raped Jiang Lili and attempted suicide out of fear of punishment, sentenced to five years in prison." Requesting approval from the Special Commissioner's Office.

After Jiang Lili learned of Zhao Lipin's suicide, she wept bitterly and said to nurse Wu Xueqin: "I have harmed someone; I have made a small matter a big one." She sought out Zhu Weiwu to request a correction. Zhu said: "It cannot be changed. Can you be wrong about something you did yourself!" Zhu Weiwu instructed the Health Center staff not to approach Jiang Lili, so that wherever Jiang Lili went, she was chased away. Jiang Lili often cried, but no one cared. Under these circumstances, Jiang Lili committed suicide by jumping into a well on the night of December 16. Before her suicide, she left a suicide note saying: "Zhao Lipin did not rape me. I deceived myself. Zhu Weiwu forced me to say it. I was ill at the time and had no way to resist being forced to admit it."

After Jiang Lili committed suicide, Cheng Dingjie, secretary of the County People's Court, not only did not investigate the cause of the incident, but insisted on seeing whether Jiang Lili had actually been "raped" and whether she was pregnant. For this purpose, he, along with Hong Xiaohu, a staff member of the County People's Supervision Committee, the secretary of the Procuratorate, and a doctor, exhumed the body for an autopsy. They dissected Jiang Lili's body and removed her uterus. Such lawless acts were not stopped by anyone!

After discovering this incident, the Anhui Provincial People's Supervision Committee and the Huizhou Special Commissioner's Office Supervision Office sent people to investigate the truth of the matter in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring. Zhu Weiwu, the secretary of the Health Center, and Cheng Dingjie, the secretary of the County People's Court, have been arrested and brought to justice. The handling of Liu Wenzhou, the county magistrate of She County, Zhong Shengming, the deputy section chief of the Personnel Section of the County People's Government, and Zhang Jinhui, the director of the County Health Center, is currently under study.

    编者按：安徽歙县卫生院秘书朱唯物等干涉婚姻自由，非法审讯逼供，逼死人命的案件是完全不能令人容忍的。现安徽省人民监察委员会正对此案进行处理，严惩这些罪犯是完全必要的。
    安徽歙县卫生院秘书朱唯物等严重干涉婚姻自由逼死人命
    安徽歙县卫生院秘书朱唯物、院长张锦辉、县人民政府人事科副科长锺生明等干涉歙县三阳区卫生所助理护士江丽丽婚姻自由，非法审讯逼供，致江丽丽投井自杀身死。
    江丽丽在三阳区卫生所任职期间，和代理所长赵立品发生恋爱。恋爱期间，赵立品曾未经上级批准，超出制度用药为江丽丽治病，曾引起所内一些干部不满。这一情况反映到县卫生院以后，县人民政府决定将赵立品调县反省，由县人民政府人事科副科长锺生明掌握处理。锺生明在处理这一事件时，不是对赵立品进行正确的思想教育，而是着重追究他和江丽丽是否发生性的关系。这些做法，该县县长刘文周都知道。至去年十月下旬，赵立品拒绝再反省。这时锺生明和县卫生院院长张锦辉谈，要卫生院负责追问江丽丽。于是张锦辉和该院秘书朱唯物就决定将江丽丽调县反省，江丽丽被调到县卫生院以后，朱唯物就非法地对她进行审讯逼供，常常在三更半夜把她从床上拉起来讯问，强迫她承认被赵立品强奸过。江丽丽不承认，朱唯物就威胁她：“你不坦白，我叫医生检查你，开除你，叫你坐牢！”在这样威胁下，江丽丽在十一月八日被迫捏造口供：
  “赵立品给我安眠药片吃，我吃后无力挣扎，被他强奸了。”朱唯物得到这个“反省书”后，马上交给锺生明。之后，县政府就决定在全县通报。赵立品知道这事后，写了一份报告给县长刘文周，请求弄清事实。但刘文周对赵立品的报告根本没有理会。锺生明仍根据江丽丽的“反省书”继续要赵立品反省。赵立品无奈，在十一月十日写好反省书后，就服安眠药片自杀，幸经医院急救未死。但县领导干部不但对赵立品的自杀不予重视，反而荒谬地决定：“赵立品强奸江丽丽，畏罪自杀未遂，判处五年徒刑。”请专署批准。
    江丽丽知道了赵立品自杀的消息，痛哭流涕地对护士吴雪琴说：“我害了人，小事弄大了。”她找朱唯物要求更正。朱说：“不能改，你自己做的事还能错吗！”朱唯物叫卫生院的工作人员不许接近江丽丽，以致江丽丽一走到那里，就被人撵开。江丽丽常常痛哭，也无人过问。在这样情况下，江丽丽就在十二月十六日夜投井自杀了。自杀前留下遗书说：“赵立品没有强奸我，我自己欺骗了自己，朱唯物硬逼我说，我那时又在病中，没有办法被逼承认的。”
    江丽丽自杀身死后，县人民法院秘书程定稭不但不追查事件发生的原因，反而一定要看看江丽丽到底被“强奸”了没有，有没有怀孕。为这目的，他伙同县人民监察委员会工作人员洪啸虎、检察署秘书和医生等开棺验尸。他们剖开了江丽丽的尸体，取出子宫。这种无法无天的罪行，竟无人阻止！
    安徽省人民监察委员会和徽州专署监察处发现这一事件后，为制止类似事件的发生，派人对事实真相进行了调查。现已将卫生院的秘书朱唯物和县人民法院秘书程定稭等人逮捕法办，对歙县县长刘文周、县人民政府人事科副科长锺生明、县卫生院院长张锦辉等人正研究处理。
