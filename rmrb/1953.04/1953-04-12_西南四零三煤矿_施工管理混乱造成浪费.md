Southwest 403 Coal Mine:
Chaotic Construction Management Leads to Waste
The construction management of the Southwest Coal Mining Administration's 403 Coal Mine is chaotic, resulting in significant waste, and the basic construction plan for March was not completed.

The mine should have completed three projects in March: the fan equipment, the lower 95-meter return air duct, and the power transmission equipment. Due to bureaucratic leadership and a lack of comprehensive consideration for technical design, the most important fan installation in the fan equipment project and the power distribution equipment in the power transmission equipment project have not yet been completed; the design and construction of the lower 95-meter return air duct project has not even started.

There are many chaotic phenomena in the mine's basic construction work. For example, the labor plan for the first quarter of this year was only started to be compiled in March and is still shelved at the Southwest Coal Mining Administration. In the fan equipment project, the original plan was for 30 workers, but the leadership, believing the project to be important, subjectively increased it to 60 workers. Because of this unplanned allocation of labor, the completion of other projects was affected. For example, the charging room project, which should have been completed in February, was delayed until March because most of the workers were transferred to the fan project. During the construction process, due to poor planning and chaotic management, serious waste was caused. For example, in the stone excavation for water pipe laying, more than 100 workers were used, but only a dozen cubic meters of usable stone were collected. In terms of material supply, there was no plan, and urgently needed materials were not budgeted, or materials prepared for the second quarter were used prematurely. What is particularly serious is that the mine's leadership actually falsely reported achievements to deceive the higher authorities. For example, when reporting the cross-year project of 1952 to the Ministry of Fuel Industry this year, they reported that the power transmission equipment project, which only completed 20 percent of the workload in 1952, had completed 90 percent of the workload.

### 西南四零三煤矿  施工管理混乱造成浪费

    西南四零三煤矿
    施工管理混乱造成浪费
    西南煤矿管理局四零三煤矿施工管理混乱，浪费很大，三月份基本建设计划没有完成。
    该矿三月份应该完成风扇设备、下节九十五公尺回风道工作量及输电设备等三项工程。由于领导上的官僚主义，对技术设计缺乏通盘考虑，所以风扇设备工程中最主要的风扇安装和输电设备工程的配电装备至今没有完成任务；下节九十五公尺回风道工作量工程，根本还未设计和开工。
    该厂基本建设工作中的混乱现象是不少的。比如今年第一季度的劳动计划三月份才开始补编，到现在还搁在西南煤矿管理局里。在风扇设备工程中原定三十个工人，领导上认为这个工程重要，就主观地给加到六十人，因为这样无计划地调配劳动力，影响了其他工程完成任务。比如二月份应该完成的充电房工程，由于工人大多数被调到风扇工程上去，结果拖至三月份才完成任务。施工过程中，由于计划不周、管理混乱，造成严重浪费。如水管敷设打石方，用了一百多个工，只收了十几方可以使用的石头。在材料供应方面，由于没有计划，急需材料没有预算，或拉用第二季度准备材料。尤其严重的是该矿领导上竟假报成绩，欺骗上级，比如今年向中央燃料工业部呈报一九五二年跨年度工程时，竟把在一九五二年只完成百分之二十工作量的输电设备工程，呈报为完成了百分之九十的工作量。
