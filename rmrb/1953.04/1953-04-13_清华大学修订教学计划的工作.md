Tsinghua University Revises its Teaching Plan

By our reporter Bai Sheng

From the beginning of February to the end of March this year, Tsinghua University systematically revised its teaching plans and syllabuses. In the process, the teachers at Tsinghua University took another step forward in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and reforming teaching. They began to understand how to learn from the advanced Soviet teaching experience not just formally but in spirit and essence, and how to cultivate engineers with modern scientific and technological skills who can work independently.

When the school administration first proposed the revision of the teaching plan, the teachers did not pay enough attention to the work. Many teachers believed that they had studied the Soviet teaching experience for a period of time during the summer vacation last year, but the teaching plan was not well-defined. Now, it would be impossible to revise the teaching plan well in a short period of time. Some teachers were afraid of trouble and difficulties and were unwilling to revise. Some teachers believed that revising the teaching plan was just a technical issue, and it could be done by arithmetically reducing study time and courses. Everyone's understanding of the spirit and essence of the Soviet teaching plan was very insufficient. They did not appreciate that the teaching plan is the fundamental plan for cultivating talent and is part of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, they did not appreciate that there is a struggle between two different ideological systems in revising the teaching plan. If this step is not done well, then the teaching reform will encounter even greater obstacles.

After understanding these ideological situations of the teachers, the school administration and the Party Committee decided to first conduct a typical experiment in the Department of Civil Engineering and then推广 it to the entire school after gaining experience. This experiment was conducted under the direct guidance of Soviet expert Sadovnich. Before this, the teaching plan of the Department of Civil Engineering, like other departments, was roughly mechanically applying four-fifths to the time in the Soviet five-year university teaching plan before transplanting it to China. This naturally caused problems. Because our situation is different from that of the Soviet Union, our students have uneven levels, and teachers are just beginning to learn from the Soviet teaching experience. If the pace is too fast and the course content is too much, both teachers and students will feel that the teaching workload is too heavy, and the phenomenon of "indigestion" will occur. Students felt that there were too many class hours and too little self-study time, too many courses, and the knowledge they learned could not be consolidated. Teachers were busy compiling textbooks, distributing handouts, and rushing the progress of the class, implementing the teaching plan in a formalistic way.

During this revision of the teaching plan in the Department of Civil Engineering, at first, because they did not understand the spirit and essence of the Soviet teaching plan, they still simply wanted to solve the problem by increasing students' weekly self-study time and reducing weekly class time. Therefore, in order to increase students' self-study time, they uniformly changed the weekly study hours from 36 hours to 33 hours for the first to fourth grades. The reduction of courses was also extremely blind. The courses that were canceled were those that they thought were unimportant or difficult to offer, so that the "Safety and Fire Prevention Technology" course, which is not valued by capitalist countries but is valued by socialist countries for protecting workers' safety, was also canceled. It is certainly wrong to revise the teaching plan in this way. Therefore, when this teaching plan was submitted to the Soviet expert of the Department of Civil Engineering for inspection, the Soviet expert discovered that the revision of the teaching plan was carried out without first clarifying the training goals. Unlike the situation in the Soviet Union, the teaching time in our universities is four years. The teaching purpose of the Department of Civil Engineering is to train a student who graduated from middle school into a civil engineer with modern scientific and technological skills in four years. In order to achieve this goal, it is first necessary to carefully consider how the time for theoretical study, production practice, exams, course design, graduation thesis design, and holidays should be arranged in the teaching plan formulated by the Department of Civil Engineering. Which courses should be offered in the department, what proportion should each course occupy, and how much time should be allocated to lectures, exercises, and experiments, because these must be clearly stipulated in the teaching plan. Our teachers did not have a clear enough understanding of what kind of talent the teaching plan was to ensure the cultivation of, nor did they understand the role of various teaching methods, nor were they clear about the purpose of each course in the major. Therefore, they could not well consider what position each course should occupy in the entire teaching process. At the same time, due to insufficient understanding of the integrity of the teaching plan, they did not well study the mutual relationship between the courses and how each part should cooperate in the entire teaching plan. In addition, because our teachers were influenced by bourgeois teaching ideology in the past, they did not have sufficient understanding of the combination of theory and practice in teaching. Therefore, they did not give due attention to the very important components of the teaching plan—production practice, course design, and graduation thesis design. Again, when revising the teaching plan, we should have carefully considered how to gradually cultivate students' independent working ability, but the teachers of the Department of Civil Engineering ignored this point. Soviet experts pointed out that the independent working ability of students in the first and second grades of university is relatively poor. Therefore, the number of class hours and classroom exercises needs to be more. The self-study time of senior students can be gradually increased in order to develop their independent working ability. However, when the Department of Civil Engineering initially reduced the study hours, it did not consider this issue at all, but universally reduced the total number of weekly study hours in the four years from 36 hours to 33 hours.

In response to the shortcomings in the revision of the teaching plan in the Department of Civil Engineering, Soviet experts proposed several ways to streamline the courses: (1) Select a few courses from the minority courses that are within the formal study but are currently of secondary importance in China as elective courses for students with good grades. Generally, students do not learn these elective courses, and it does not affect their ability to serve. For example, "Elasticity and Plasticity Mechanics" in the major of industrial and civil construction. These elective courses do not have exams, tests, or grades. (2) Combine some courses with similar properties into one course for teaching, such as "Construction Production Technology" and "Construction Machinery" in the same major. (3) A very small number of courses in certain majors that are temporarily not needed in China can be temporarily suspended. Taking the industrial and civil construction major of the Department of Civil Engineering as an example, as a result of such streamlining, the original 37 courses were streamlined into 30 courses. In addition, in order to prevent students from learning too many courses in a semester, Soviet experts pointed out that some courses can be concentrated in one semester. In this way, the courses that were originally taught in two semesters can be concentrated in one semester. For example, "Surveying" can be concentrated in the second semester, five hours per week, three hours of lectures, and two hours of tutoring. The teaching practice immediately follows in the summer vacation. Students have fresh memories and can well combine theory and practice to achieve good results. However, teachers must master this method well, otherwise, students will not be able to accept it. Experts also pointed out that the lecture hours for courses that play a decisive role in cultivating civil engineers cannot be reduced.

Under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, the teachers of the Department of Civil Engineering overcame ideological obstacles, mastered the principles put forward by Soviet experts, and completed the work of revising the teaching plan. Afterwards, the school administration decided to promote the experience of revising the teaching plan in the Department of Civil Engineering throughout the school. At the teaching research meeting held by the school administration for revising the teaching plan, President Jiang Nanxiang, Soviet expert Sadovnich, and Director of the Department of Civil Engineering Zhang Wei made reports respectively. Many teachers began to recognize the importance of revising the teaching plan and展开 discussions in conjunction with their thinking. Many teachers have realized that in the past, when studying the Soviet teaching experience to formulate teaching plans, they did not appreciate its spirit and essence. The courses in the Soviet teaching plan, whether they are major courses or minor courses, basic courses or professional courses, were all copied as they were. As for the content of each course and its mutual relationship, they were not considered at all. Many teachers talked about that when they formulated the teaching plan, they did not clearly realize what kind of talent they wanted to cultivate, nor were they clear about the position of the course they taught in the entire teaching plan. Some courses were completely copied from the Soviet teaching plan, and it was not clear what the content was about, and some even reversed the order of the course content. Some also translated the course names incorrectly. Teachers of the same major also had inconsistent understandings of the course content and even the training goals. For example, in the "Mechanical Manufacturing Engineering" major, some teachers understood that it was to cultivate design talents, and some understood that it was to cultivate manufacturing talents. When formulating the teaching plan, some teachers unconsciously required students to learn according to the teaching content they had learned in the past, and they advocated deleting courses they had not learned. In particular, not enough attention was paid to how to implement the principles of combining theory with practice and cultivating students' ability to think independently in the teaching plan. Some teachers even wanted to cancel the very important parts of teaching—course design and graduation thesis design—according to the situation in bourgeois universities.

Some teachers examined their previous shortcomings in being unhumble and unserious in learning from the Soviet Union. Some teachers reviewed that because they were influenced by the teaching system of the British and American bourgeoisie in the past, although they recognized the superiority of the Soviet teaching system on the surface and said they would learn from the Soviet experience, they were still doing the British and American bourgeoisie's system.

After listening to the reports of the President and Soviet experts, and after studying, the teachers have realized that to correct the formalism problem in learning from the advanced Soviet teaching experience, they must appreciate its spirit and essence, and start learning from doing a good job in the teaching plan first. But some teachers felt that the principles of revising the teaching plan talked about by Soviet experts were all good, but there were many specific difficulties in doing it. They emphasized that there were no Soviet experts in the department, no one to guide them, and no Soviet textbooks, so things would still not be done well. Some teachers also said, "I myself cannot think independently, so how can I cultivate students' ability to think independently?"

In response to these ideological problems of the teachers, Soviet experts provided specific help and made reports on the issue of "training goals" in individual departments. The teaching and research groups held meetings to discuss the experts' reports, analyzed the situation in the department, studied the students' learning situation, and began to revise the teaching plan. In this way, after repeated studies, the teaching plans of each department and each major were revised.

On the basis of revising the teaching plan, the work of revising the syllabus was also展开. According to the guidance of the experts, the teachers have realized through the revision of the teaching plan that if the teaching plan is revised very well, but there is no good syllabus, the teaching purpose cannot be achieved. Therefore, the syllabus must be revised according to the already revised teaching plan. Soviet expert Dementiev also made a special report on the work of revising the syllabus. The entire school then focused on the mechanical parts teaching and research group and the physics teaching and research group, and first展开 the work of revising the syllabus. Because the teachers had realized in the revision of the teaching plan that the revision of the syllabus must also be carried out in conjunction with the training goals of the major, their understanding of the purpose of the syllabus was relatively clear. At the same time, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the teachers also paid attention to how to reflect the characteristics of China in the syllabus and ensure that its content conforms to the principle of "teachers can teach and students can understand." Through this revision work, many teachers felt that they not only had a great harvest in their thinking, but also further improved in learning from the advanced Soviet teaching experience.

    清华大学修订教学计划的工作
    本报记者  柏生
    从今年二月开始到三月底，清华大学有计划地进行了修订教学计划、教学大纲的工作。在进行这一工作的过程中，清华大学的教师们在学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革工作上，又前进了一步。他们开始认识了怎样才不是从形式上而是从精神实质上来学习苏联的先进教学经验；认识了怎样培养具有现代科学技术水平的有独立工作能力的工程师。
    在学校行政方面刚提出修订教学计划工作时，教师们对这一工作是不够重视的。许多教师认为在去年暑假期间学习了一段时间的苏联教学经验，也没有把教学计划订好，现在要在短时间内就修订好教学计划，是不可能的。有些教师则是怕麻烦、怕困难，不愿意修改；有些教师认为，修改教学计划不过是个技术问题，用算术的办法减少一些学习时间和课程就行了。大家对苏联教学计划的精神实质认识得是很不够的，没有体会到教学计划是培养人材的根本方案，是苏联先进经验的一部分；更没有体会到在修改教学计划中存在着两种不同思想体系的斗争，如果这一步做不好，那么，教学改革就会遇到更大的阻碍。
    学校行政方面和党委在了解了教师们的这些思想情况以后，便决定先在土木系进行典型试验，取得经验后向全校推广。这次试验是在苏联专家萨多维奇的直接指导下进行的。在这以前，土木系的教学计划和其他系的一样，大致是机械地将苏联五年制大学的教学计划中的时间普遍地乘以五分之四后，就搬到中国来的，这样自然就发生了问题。因为我们和苏联的情况不同，我们的学生程度不齐，教师也还是刚刚开始学苏联的教学经验，进度一快，课程内容一多，师生双方就都感到教学分量过重，并因而发生了“消化不良”的现象。同学们感到上课时间多，自学时间少，课程门数太多，学习到的知识不能巩固；教师们则忙于编译教材，发讲义，上课赶进度，形式主义地在执行教学计划。
    这次土木系修订教学计划时，最初因为对苏联教学计划的精神实质了解不够，仍然只是想简单地用增加同学每周自学时间、减少每周上课时间的办法来解决问题。于是为了增加同学们的自学时间，他们便把第一学年到第四学年的每周学习时数，一律由三十六小时改为三十三小时。课程门数的缩减也带着极大的盲目性，取消了的课程，都是他们自以为不重要的或者不好开的，以致把为资本主义国家所不重视的而为社会主义国家所重视的保护工人安全的“保安与防火技术”这一门课程也取消了。用这样的办法修订教学计划当然是不对的，所以在这份教学计划交给土木系苏联专家来检查的时候，苏联专家便发现教学计划的修订工作首先是在没有明确培养目标的情况下进行的。和苏联的情况不同，我国大学的教学时间是四年，土木系的教学目的，是要在四年当中把一个从中学毕业的学生培养成为具有现代科学技术水平的土木工程师。为了达到这个目的，首先就必须很好地考虑，在土木系制订的教学计划里，理论学习、生产实习、考试、课程设计、毕业论文设计和假期的时间应该怎么安排；系里要开哪些课程，每门课程应该占多大的比重，讲演、练习、实验各占多少时间，因为这些都是必须明确地规定在教学计划内的。而我们的教师首先就对教学计划是为了保证培养何种人材这一点就认识得不够清楚，对于各种教学方式的作用也不够了解，对于专业中每门课程的目的性也不够明确，因此对于每门课程在整个教学过程中究竟应占什么样的地位，也就不能很好地考虑。同时由于对教学计划的整体性认识不足，对于各门功课之间的互相关系，以及在整个教学计划中各部分应如何配合，也就没有很好地研究。此外，由于我们的教师过去受了资产阶级教学思想的影响，对教学中理论和实际结合这点也没有足够认识，因此对教学计划中很重要的组成部分——生产实习和课程设计以及毕业论文设计等部分也就没有给以应有的重视。再次是，在修订教学计划时，本应很好地考虑如何逐步培养学生的独立工作能力，但是土木系的教师对这点也忽略了。苏联专家指出，大学一二年级的同学，独立工作的能力是比较差的，因此，上课和课堂练习的时数就需要多一些；高年级同学的自学时间则可以逐渐增加，以便发展他们独立工作的能力。可是土木系在最初缩减学习时数的时候，就根本没有考虑到这个问题，而是普遍把四年中每周学习的总时数都一律从三十六小时减为三十三小时。
    针对土木系这次修订教学计划工作中的缺点，苏联专家提出了精简课程的几种办法：（一）把正规学习之内的但目前在中国居于比较次要地位的少数课程，拣出几种作为成绩好的学生的选修课程，一般学生不学这些选修课程并不影响他们出去服务的能力。例如工业及民用建筑专业的“弹性及塑性力学”等。这些选修课程，不考试，不测验，也不计成绩。（二）把一些性质相近的课程合并起来，作为一门课讲授，例如同一专业的“建筑生产技术”及“建筑机械”。（三）某些专业里的极少数课程，暂时对中国尚不需要的可以暂时停开。以土木系工业及民用建筑专业为例，这样精简的结果，就把原来的三十七门课程精简成为三十门了。另外，为了使学生在一学期中所学课程门数不致太多，苏联专家指出，有些课程可以集中在一学期读完，这样可把原来在两学期讲的课程集中在一学期讲授，例如“测量学”即可集中在第二学期读完，每周五小时，三小时讲课，两小时辅导，在暑假紧接着就进行教学实习，同学记忆犹新，可以很好地使理论和实际结合起来，得到很好的效果。但教师一定要很好地掌握这种方法，否则也会使同学接受不了。专家还指出，对培养土木工程师起决定性作用的课程的讲课时数是不能减少的。
    土木系教师在苏联专家的具体指导下，克服了思想障碍，掌握了苏联专家所提出的原则，完成了修订教学计划的工作。以后，学校行政方面便决定把土木系修订教学计划的经验在全校推广。在学校行政方面为了修订教学计划所召开的教学研究会上，校长蒋南翔和苏联专家萨多维奇，以及土木系主任张维分别做了报告。许多教师开始认识了修订教学计划的重要意义，并结合思想展开了讨论。许多教师已认识到过去学习苏联教学经验制订教学计划时，并没有体会它的精神实质。苏联教学计划中的课程，不管它是主要课，还是次要课，是基础课，还是专业课，都如数照抄过来，至于各课程的内容及其相互关系，就根本没有考虑。许多教师谈到自己当时制订教学计划时，根本就没有明确地认识到究竟要培养什么样的人材，对他自己教的课程在整个教学计划中所占的地位也不清楚。有的课程因为完全是从苏联教学计划中照抄过来的，内容讲的是什么也不清楚，有的竟把课程内容的次序弄颠倒了；也有的把课程名字翻译错了。同一专业的教师，彼此对课程内容以至培养目标的了解也不一致，譬如“机械制造工程”专业，有的教师了解是培养设计人材的，有的了解是培养制造人材的。有些教师在制订教学计划时，不自觉地要求学生们按照自己过去所学的那一套教学内容来学，自己没有学过的课程就主张删掉。特别是在教学计划中如何才能贯彻理论与实际结合和培养学生独立思考能力的原则注意很不够。有的教师甚至是按照资产阶级大学里的情形，想把教学中很重要的部分——课程设计和毕业论文设计取消。
    有些教师检查了自己以前在学习苏联方面不够虚心和认真的缺点。有的教师检讨，因为过去受了英美资产阶级的一套教学体系的影响，表面上虽然认识到苏联教学制度的优越性，口头上也说学习苏联经验，但作的仍是英美资产阶级的一套。
    教师们听了校长和苏联专家的报告后，又经过学习，已经认识到要纠正在学习苏联先进教学经验中的形式主义毛病，必须体会它的精神实质，并首先从作好教学计划来开始学习。但也有些教师觉得，苏联专家谈的修改教学计划的原则都好，可是做起来具体困难多，他们强调系里没有苏联专家，没人指导，没有苏联教科书，事情还是做不好。也有的教师说，我自己就不能独立思考，又怎能培养学生独立思考的能力呢？
    针对着教师的这些思想问题，苏联专家又做了具体的帮助，并在个别系里做了“培养目标”问题的报告。各教研组开会讨论了专家的报告，分析了系内的情况，研究了同学们学习的情况，便开始着手修订教学计划。这样，经过反复的研究，每个系每个专业的教学计划都做了修订。
    在修订教学计划的基础上，又展开了修改教学大纲的工作。根据专家的指导，教师们通过修订教学计划，已经认识到如果光是教学计划修订得很好，但没有好的教学大纲，也是不能达到教学目的的。因此必须按照已经修订的教学计划来修改教学大纲。苏联专家杰门节夫并对修改教学大纲的工作作了一个专题报告。全校遂以机械零件教研组和物理教研组为重点，首先展开了修改教学大纲的工作。教师们因为在修订教学计划中已经认识到修改教学大纲也必须结合专业的培养目标来进行，因此，对教学大纲的目的性认识得比较明确。同时教师们在苏联专家的指导下，也注意了如何在教学大纲中体现中国的特点，保证它的内容符合“先生能教，学生能懂”的原则。经过这次修改工作，许多教师都感到自己不仅在思想上有了很大的收获，同时在学习苏联先进教学经验上，也更提高了一步。
