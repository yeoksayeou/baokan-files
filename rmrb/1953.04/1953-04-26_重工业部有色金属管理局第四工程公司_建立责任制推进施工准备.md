The Fourth Engineering Company of the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
Establishes Responsibility System to Promote Construction Preparation

[This newspaper reports] The Fourth Engineering Company of the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, after exposing the past waste and lack of accountability in construction, is holding various professional meetings to establish a responsibility system. This has greatly promoted the construction preparation work, and some projects can be started soon.

The Fourth Engineering Company's movement against construction waste and lack of accountability began in late March. At that time, the situation was: the basic construction tasks were very heavy, and the start date was approaching, but there was a serious mentality of waiting and relying on others both above and below. The on-site preparation work was very chaotic. Temporary housing was not completed on time, old housing had not been repaired, the woodworking factory's machines had not been installed, and materials and tools were not complete. Departments and teams did not communicate, and departments and sections shirked responsibilities to each other, so construction preparation work was progressing very slowly. In response to this situation, the Fourth Engineering Company first focused on opposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible to promote construction preparation work and strive to start construction on schedule. Engineering teams that did not yet have construction tasks focused on reviewing last year's work. Problems exposed by the masses that could be solved or had to be solved were immediately addressed. For example, in response to the poor quality of the construction organization design and the lack of accountability for temporary construction, a temporary organization was established to inspect and promote the construction organization design work, and specific personnel were immediately designated to be responsible for temporary construction. Another example is the large chimney project for the 301 Factory contracted by the company. Because a few small parts could not be found, both parties shirked responsibility to each other, which affected the start of construction. After this problem was raised this time, the parts were found, and the portable rails and winches that had not been borrowed in the past were also found, so the large chimney project can be started soon. After such exposure and inspection, the mentality of waiting and relying on others and the phenomenon of no one being responsible were basically corrected, and the construction preparation work has greatly advanced. The masses feel that this approach "can solve problems" and is much better than the previous method of "the masses exposing, the leaders reviewing, and everything remaining the same after the review."

The Fourth Engineering Company also established a responsibility system based on the problems identified in the inspection, that is, clearly establishing the working relationships between departments and departments, trades and trades, superiors and subordinates, etc., to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible from the system level. The specific approach to establishing the responsibility system is: first, the relevant departments draft a responsibility system plan based on the problems identified in the inspection, then convene professional meetings with relevant leaders of each engineering team for detailed study, and then, after reaching a consensus, formally announce and implement it after review and approval by the leadership. For example, the technical inspection meeting is chaired by the chief engineer and the technical inspection department. The meeting summarized the lessons learned from the poor quality of projects last year, determined the project quality standards and operating procedures, and stipulated that technicians of each team are responsible for conveying the operating procedures to the workers. The technical inspection department is also preparing to write the operating procedures in simple language, categorized on wooden boards, and erected at each construction site so that workers can check the project according to the procedures at any time. At the materials meeting, the specifications of various materials were determined, and a series of systems for procurement, acceptance, storage, application, and return of materials were established. In the past, there was no contact system between the materials department and the warehouse. Often, the materials department spent a lot of money on purchasing materials from outside, while the warehouse was stocking such materials that were going moldy. This time, a new material purchase form has been created. When the materials department purchases materials, it also sends a copy to the warehouse. The materials department has also organized two teams to clean up the warehouse to first find out the "family property" of the warehouse. In the past, the coordination between civil engineering and water, heating, and electrical installation projects was not good in construction work, which caused great waste and affected the quality of the project. This time, a professional meeting on the coordination of water, heating, electricity, and civil engineering and a special responsibility system meeting on brick and wood projects were also held, and a unified contact system was established. The Fourth Engineering Company has already held and is holding professional meetings on scheduling, security, wage distribution, and the team leader's daily report system, and other professional meetings are also being actively prepared.

Although the Fourth Engineering Company's movement against construction waste and lack of accountability has achieved these gains, the movement is not yet deep and thorough enough, especially it has not deeply exposed the serious waste in last year's construction to learn lessons from it, so that all personnel can firmly establish the idea of economic accounting. According to the facts initially revealed, the waste and lack of accountability in the past were very serious. According to statistics from the finance department, last year's administrative management expenses of the entire company exceeded 1.5 billion yuan. One of the reasons is that the organization is too large and there are too many administrative management personnel. The higher-level authorities stipulate that the ratio of administrative management cadres to workers in the engineering department is 6.5 to 1, but the company's ratio is 4 to 1. The materials department lacks planning in purchasing materials and does not have enough contact with the application department. According to preliminary estimates, the materials accumulated in the warehouse amount to 7 to 8 billion yuan. On the construction site, model boards were not properly kept after being removed and were damaged at will. According to this estimate, about 150,000 kilograms of model boards were burned as firewood, worth 210 million yuan. Tools and other equipment also caused a lot of waste because no one was responsible. The company originally had 60 mobile houses on the construction site, but only 55 were dismantled and returned. The whereabouts of the other five are unknown, with a loss of more than 100 million yuan. Due to the lack of accountability in technical management, the basic construction projects undertaken by the company last year generally found poor quality, and many buildings have cracks. Some of the family dormitories built in a certain place will collapse this year.

    建立责任制推进施工准备
    【本报讯】中央重工业部有色金属管理局第四工程公司揭发过去施工中的浪费和无人负责现象之后，正在召开各种专业会议，建立责任制。这就大大推进了施工准备工作，部分工程即可开工。
    第四工程公司的反对施工浪费和反对无人负责的运动，是在三月下旬开始的。当时的情况是：基本建设任务很重，开工日期日益逼近，但是上下都有着严重的等待依赖思想，工地准备工作十分混乱，暂设房屋新的不能按期完成，旧的还没修理好，木工厂的机器还没安上，材料和工具都不齐备，科与队不通气，科与股之间对工作互相推诿，施工准备工作进展很慢。针对这种情况，第四工程公司首先以反对无人负责现象为重点，推进施工准备工作，争取按期开工。目前还没有施工任务的工程队，则以检查去年的工作为主。对群众揭发出来的问题，凡可以解决或必须解决的，就立即加以解决。例如对检查中提出的施工组织设计做得太差和暂设工程无人负责的情况，就成立了一个临时组织，检查与推动施工组织设计工作，和立即指定专人负责暂设工程。又如承包的三○一厂大烟筒工程，因为几个小零件没有找到，甲乙双方互相推诿，影响了开工。这次把这个问题提出来后，零件找到了，过去没有借到的轻便轨道和卷扬机，也设法借到了，因此，大烟筒工程很快就可以开工。经过这样的揭发和检查，基本上纠正了等待依赖思想和无人负责现象，施工准备工作大大前进了一步。群众觉得这样做“能解决问题”，比过去“群众揭发，领导检讨，检讨之后，一切照旧”的办法好得多。
    第四工程公司并根据检查出来的问题，分别建立责任制，即明确建立科与科、工种与工种，上与下等等工作关系，从制度上来克服无人负责现象。建立责任制的具体做法是：首先由各有关科根据检查出来的问题，拟出一个责任制草案，然后召集各工程队有关负责人开专业会议，详细研究，并在取得一致意见后，经领导方面审阅批准，正式公布施行。例如召开的技术检查会议，由主任工程师和技术检查科负责主持。会议总结了去年工程质量低劣的教训，确定了工程质量标准和操作规程，同时规定由各队技术员负责将操作规程传达给工人。技术检查科并准备将操作规程用通俗的文字分门别类写在木板上，竖在各工地，以便工人们可以随时根据规程检查工程。在召开的材料会议上，确定了各种材料的规格，和订出了采购、验收、保管、施用、退料的一系列制度。过去材料科与仓库没有联系制度，往往材料科化了很多钱在外购料，而仓库里却积压着这类材料在发霉。这次已制出一种新的购料表格，材料科在购料时，就同时送一份给仓库。材料科并组织了两个小组在清理仓库，先摸清楚仓库的“家底”。过去在施工工作中，土木工程和水、暖、电安装工程配合得不好，曾经造成很大的浪费，影响了工程质量，这次也召开了水、暖、电与土木工程配合专业会议和砖木工程专责制会议，订出了统一的联系制度。第四工程公司已经召开和正在召开的专业会议还有：调度、保安、工资发放、组长日报制等专业会议，其余的各种专业会议也正积极准备中。
    第四工程公司这次反对施工浪费和反对无人负责现象的运动，虽然有了这些收获，但是运动还搞得不深不透，尤其是还没有深入地把去年施工中的严重浪费现象揭发出来，以便从中吸取教训，使全体人员能牢固地树立经济核算的思想。根据初步揭发出来的事实来看，过去的浪费和无人负责现象是十分严重的。据财务科统计，去年全公司行政管理费用竟超出十五亿元，其原因之一是机构过于庞大、行政管理人员过多。上级规定工程部门行政管理干部与工人的比例是六点五比一，可是该公司是四比一。材料部门由于购料缺乏计划，与施用部门联系不够，据初步估计，仓库中积压的材料达七、八十亿元。施工现场上模型板拆除后都没有很好地加以保管，随意损坏。据此次估计，把模型板当劈柴烧掉的约有十五万公斤，值二亿一千万元。工具和其他器材，因为无人负责，也造成许多浪费，公司原在工地上有六十幢活动房屋，可是只拆回了五十五幢，另五幢已不知去向，损失一亿元以上。由于技术管理方面存在无人负责现象，该公司去年承建的基本建设工程普遍发现质量低劣的现象，许多建筑物都发现有裂缝，建筑在某处的家属宿舍，有的今年就要倒了。
