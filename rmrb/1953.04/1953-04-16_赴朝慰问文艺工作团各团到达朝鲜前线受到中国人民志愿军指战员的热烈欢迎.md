The members of the performing arts troupes sent by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea to console the troops have arrived at the Korean front lines from various locations in late March and early April to carry out their consolation work.

After the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea issued instructions in December of last year on continuing to strengthen the effort to Resist America, Aid Korea, the people of the whole country responded enthusiastically. Literary and artistic workers from all over the country have requested to go to the Korean front lines to provide consolation. The Committee decided to form six performing arts troupes from literary and artistic workers from Beijing, Tianjin, and the major administrative regions of Northeast, East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest to go to Korea to console the troops. Before departing, each troupe prepared a total of 274 wonderful programs, including dramas, operas, Peking operas, local operas, dances, folk arts, choruses, solo performances, instrumental ensembles, shadow puppets, puppet shows, and acrobatics. In addition, each troupe was equipped with film projection teams, carrying feature films such as "South and North Wars," "Dragon Beard Ditch," and "When the Grapes Are Ripe," as well as documentaries reflecting the great construction of the motherland, such as "Be Sure to Harness the Huai River Well," "The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Opens to Traffic," and "Oil in the Gobi Desert." The performing arts troupes from most regions also brought speaking materials reporting on the construction work in their respective areas. Some troupe members had gone deep into factories before departing to observe the achievements of the motherland's industrial construction firsthand, so as to better report to the volunteer soldiers.

In order to suit the needs of battlefield performances, each performing arts troupe included many performance groups that could operate independently, allowing them to go deep into the front lines and into the tunnels to perform for the soldiers. (Xinhua News Agency)

Xinhua News Agency: The members of the performing arts troupes sent by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea have successively arrived at the Korean front lines and have been warmly welcomed by all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

The leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a warm welcome meeting on the evening of the 10th. General Li Zhimin, Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered a welcome speech, deeply thanking the people of the motherland for their enthusiastic support and the boundless care of the great leader Chairman Mao on behalf of the entire Volunteer Army. He said, "The support of the people of the motherland for us is meticulous. If we need grain, we have grain; if we need guns, we have guns; we have whatever we need, and we have as much as we need. Cotton clothing was sent before the autumn leaves fell, and single-layer clothing was sent before the snow melted. It has not even been half a year since the second comfort group returned to China, and the motherland has sent another performing arts troupe of nearly a thousand people to the Korean front." He then expressed his deep admiration for the enthusiasm, hard work, and fearless spirit of all the members of the performing arts troupes. In his speech, General Li Zhimin especially expressed his gratitude to the Xiangyu Opera Troupe, led by Chang Xiangyu, who donated a fighter plane; to the famous actors Zhang Yunxi, Zhang Chunhua, Yang Xiaoting, and others who had gained great honor in their overseas performances; and to Chang Baohua, the younger brother of martyr Chang Baokun, who participated in the first comfort group and gloriously sacrificed himself on the front lines. Finally, he emphasized that all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army unanimously support the fair and reasonable propositions put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung for resolving the issue of the entire prisoner of war and the Korean armistice, and are willing to make unremitting efforts to achieve them.

Zhang Yunxi, head of the first performing arts troupe, delivered a message of condolence at the meeting. He said: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the motherland is developing by leaps and bounds on a large scale, which is inseparable from the Volunteer Army comrades' defense of the motherland and their heroic fighting. Peace-loving people all over the world are singing the praises of your heroic deeds, and they often toast your victories. Finally, he wished the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army even greater victories in their struggle to defend world peace.

Ye Mingming and other members of the children's team of the first performing arts troupe, representing the hearts of millions of children in the motherland, presented red scarves to the leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. At this moment, warm cheers and applause rang out throughout the venue.
