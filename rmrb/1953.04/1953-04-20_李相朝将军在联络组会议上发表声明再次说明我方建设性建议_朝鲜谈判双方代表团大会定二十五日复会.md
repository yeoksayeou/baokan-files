Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 19th: The Korean and Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued the following communique on April 19th:

The seventh meeting of the Liaison Group of both sides was held in Panmunjom at 11:00 AM on April 19th.

At the meeting, General Li Xiangzhao, Chief Liaison Officer of our side, under the instruction of General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of our delegation, issued a statement pointing out: The new proposal recently put forward by our side, namely, that both negotiating parties guarantee the immediate repatriation after the armistice of all prisoners of war in their custody who insist on repatriation, and that the remaining prisoners of war be handed over to neutral nations to ensure a just resolution of their repatriation issue, is a proposal recognized worldwide as highly constructive. As for the specific implementation of this proposal, it can obviously only be decided through mutual consultation at a meeting of the delegations of both sides. Any specific proposal in this regard should be put forward at a meeting of the delegations of both sides. The progress of the negotiations depends on the efforts of both sides, and the delegations of both sides should work together to achieve a Korean armistice.

At the meeting, both sides agreed that the plenary session of the delegations of both sides to the Korean armistice negotiations would resume on April 25th to negotiate a resolution to the entire prisoner of war issue and seek the Korean armistice desired by the world.

The full text of General Li Xiangzhao's main speech at the Liaison Group meeting on April 19th is as follows:

Before the Liaison Group meeting enters into a discussion on determining the date of resumption, I am instructed by the Chief Delegate of our side to make the following statement: I have studied the letter from your Chief Delegate on April 16th and deem it necessary to point out that our new proposal for resolving the entire prisoner of war issue, as explained by the Chief Delegate of our side in his letter to your Chief Delegate on April 9th, is a highly constructive proposal. In order to eliminate the differences between the two sides on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation and to promote the Korean armistice desired by the world, our side has made significant concessions regarding the steps, timing, and methods of prisoner of war repatriation. Our side proposes that the repatriation of prisoners of war be carried out in two stages: namely, that both negotiating parties should guarantee the immediate repatriation after the armistice of all prisoners of war in their custody who insist on repatriation, and that the remaining prisoners of war be handed over to neutral nations to ensure a just resolution of their repatriation issue. The highly constructive nature of this proposal has been recognized worldwide. As for the specific implementation of this proposal, it is obvious that it can only be decided through mutual consultation at the negotiating meeting of the delegations of both sides. This is how agreements on other important issues in the Korean armistice have been reached. In fact, in equal negotiations between the two sides, only consultations and discussions at the meeting are the proper way to solve problems. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers believe that any specific proposal from either side should be put forward at the negotiating meeting of the delegations of both sides. The progress of the negotiations depends on the efforts of both sides. Before the negotiating meeting resumes, the task facing the delegations of both sides is not to contemplate adjournments after the resumption, but to quickly agree on a date for the resumption, resume negotiations, and work together to achieve a Korean armistice.

Attached is the letter from U.S. Chief Negotiator General Harrison to our Chief Negotiator General Nam Il on April 16th:

To General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:

I am instructed by the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command to instruct the United Nations Command Liaison Group to meet with your Liaison Group on April 18th or as soon as possible thereafter at a date you deem appropriate, to discuss matters related to the resumption of the plenary session of the armistice negotiation delegation, as requested by your Liaison Group on April 11th.

The United Nations Command has studied your explanation of your official position, but has not received the detailed elaboration of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and Marshal Kim Il-sung's statement requested by General Clark on April 5th. However, in view of the fact that your commanders agreed with the suggestions made by General Clark in his letter of March 31st in their letter of April 1st, it is assumed that you are prepared to accept several proposals of the United Nations Command, or are prepared to put forward your own proposals of equal constructiveness that can serve as an effective basis for resumption.

Regarding Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and Marshal Kim Il-sung's statement, the United Nations Command believes that an arrangement such as the following is reasonable and constructive and can lead to a rapid resolution of the prisoner of war issue:

(1) A neutral nation is a nation traditionally considered suitable for such matters, such as Switzerland.

(2) For practical purposes, prisoners of war not directly repatriated are released to neutral nations for accommodation in Korea.

(3) Within a reasonable period of time, such as sixty days, the neutral nation will give the parties concerned the opportunity to determine the attitude of those under its custody towards their status. After this period, the neutral nation will make arrangements to peacefully deal with those still under its custody.

The United Nations Command believes that unless the full delegation shows signs of reaching an acceptable agreement within a reasonable period of time, it is best to adjourn again.

(Signed) William K. Harrison, Lieutenant General, United States Army, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation, April 16, 1953

### 李相朝将军在联络组会议上发表声明再次说明我方建设性建议  朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会定二十五日复会

    李相朝将军在联络组会议上发表声明再次说明我方建设性建议
    朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会定二十五日复会
    【新华社开城十九日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月十九日发表公报如下：
    双方联络组四月十九日上午十一时在板门店举行第七次会议。
    会上我方联络组首席组员李相朝将军奉我方代表团首席代表南日大将之命，发表声明，指出：我方最近所提的新建议，即由谈判双方保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决，是举世公认为具有高度建设性的建议。至于这个建议的具体实施办法，则显然只有在双方谈判代表团的会议上，经过相互的协商才能决定。任何一方关于这一方面的具体提案，都应该在双方谈判代表的会议上提出。谈判的进展有赖于双方的努力，双方代表团应该共同努力实现朝鲜停战。
    会上双方同意朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会在四月二十五日复会，以协商解决整个战俘问题，谋取举世渴望的朝鲜停战。
    四月十九日双方联络组会上李相朝将军主要发言全文如下：
    在联络组会议进入商定复会日期的讨论之前，我奉我方首席代表之命作如下声明：我研究了你方首席代表四月十六日的来信，认为有必要指出，我方解决整个战俘问题的新建议，一如我方首席代表在其四月九日致你方首席代表的去信中所说明的，是具有高度建设性的建议。为消除双方在战俘遣返问题上的分歧，促成举世渴望的朝鲜停战，我方对于战俘遣返的步骤、时间和方法作了明显的让步。我方建议将战俘的遣返分成两个步骤来进行，即：谈判双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。这个建议的高度建设性已为举世所公认。至于这个建议的具体实施办法，很显然只有在双方代表团的谈判会议上，经过相互的协商才能决定。双方对于朝鲜停战中其他各项重要问题的协议都是这样达成的。事实上，在双方对等的谈判中，也只有会议上的协商讨论，才是解决问题的正当途径。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军认为任何一方的具体提案都应该在双方代表的谈判会议上提出。谈判的进展有赖于双方的努力。在谈判会议尚未复会之前，摆在双方代表团面前的任务不是设想复会之后的休会，而是迅速商定复会日期，恢复谈判，共同努力实现朝鲜停战。
    附美方首席谈判代表哈利逊将军四月十六日给我方首席谈判代表南日大将的信：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军：
    我奉联合国军总司令之命，指示联合国军联络组在四月十八日或在你方认为适宜的其后尽早的日期，与你方联络组会晤，讨论与停战谈判代表团大会复会有关的事宜，有如你方联络组在四月十一日所要求的。
    联合国军已经研究了你所提出的关于你方官方立场的说明，但并未得到四月五日克拉克将军所要求的对于周恩来外长的声明及金日成元帅的声明在细节方面的引申。但鉴于你方司令官在四月一日信中，已对克拉克将军在三月三十一日信中所提出的建议表示同意，兹假定你们已准备接受联合国军的几项提案，或已准备提出你们自己的有同等建设性的、可以成为复会的有效基础的提案。
    关于周恩来外长的声明以及金日成元帅的声明，联合国军认为诸如下列的一个安排是合理而有建设性的，并可引导到战俘问题的迅速解决：
    （一）中立国为诸如瑞士这样传统上被认为适合于这类事项的一个国家。
    （二）为求实际可行，未被直接遣返的战俘释交中立国在朝鲜收容。
    （三）在诸如六十天的合理的时间内，中立国给予有关各方以机会，来确定在其收容下的人员对于他们的地位的态度。在此期限后，中立国将作出安排以和平处理仍在其收容下的人员。
    联合国军认为除非代表团全体大会具有在合理时间内达成一个可被接受的协议的迹象，最好还是重行休会。联合国军代表团首席代表美国中将威廉·凯·哈利逊（签名）一九五三年四月十六日
