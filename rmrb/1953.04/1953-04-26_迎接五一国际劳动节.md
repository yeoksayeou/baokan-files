    Welcoming the May First International Labor Day
    Soviet Workers Continuously Launch "May First" Competition
    Xinhua News Agency: Soviet working people in various regions are continuously launching labor competitions to welcome the "May First" International Labor Day. Workers at the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow recently received a "May First" competition challenge letter from the A. Kharlamov foundry team of the Gorky Molotov Automobile Factory. In the challenge letter, the Kharlamov team promised to complete the first half-year production plan ahead of schedule, adopt 250 rationalization proposals, and save 300 tons of metal. The workers of the Stalin Automobile Factory immediately accepted the challenge. The factory's Stakhanovite gray cast iron workshop has been overproducing eight to ten tons of cast iron daily since the beginning of April; the foreman of the second mold workshop, Tikhomirov, guaranteed to complete 102 percent of the April plan and reduce losses caused by defective products. Oil workers in Baku adopted the method of rapid drilling in the "May First" competition, accelerating the drilling work of offshore oil fields. The work team led by the advanced worker Dadash completed the drilling of a very deep twin-pipe well 22 days ahead of schedule. In Ivanovo, approximately 100,000 textile workers, machine manufacturers, railway employees, and local industrial workers participated in the "May First" competition. Textile workers completed the March plan ahead of schedule, overproducing more than 6 million meters of fabric. In mid-April, they increased their speed, overproducing tens of thousands of meters of textiles every day and night. They have now proposed a guarantee to save 1,100 tons of cotton and yarn this year, overproduce 10 million meters of fabric with the saved materials, and improve quality.
    Significant Achievements in Soviet Agricultural Laborers' Competition
    Soviet agricultural laborers have also achieved significant accomplishments in the thriving "May First" competition. Agricultural machinery operators and collective farmers in the Odessa Oblast of Ukraine jointly pledged to make this year's sugar beet harvest reach the standard set for 1955 in the Five-Year Plan. Their sugar beet planting speed this year is twice as fast as last year. In Kazakhstan, more than 1,000 tractor teams participated in the "May First" competition. The "May First" guarantee of the Agfonov tractor team of the Irisk Tractor Station was to complete the spring sowing work within ten days; they completed this guarantee in eight days. Many agricultural machinery operators in Kuban and Sevastopol have also achieved great success in the "May First" competition.
    Soviet Sailors Enthusiastically Join the Competition
    At sea in the Far East, sailors also launched a heated "May First" competition. The competition movement was initiated by the crew of the Vladivostok tanker "Joseph Stalin." This ship recently sent a telegram reporting that the entire crew had formed Stakhanovite work teams to overfulfill navigation tasks. In the past two voyages, the tanker saved 40 hours of navigation time, 11 percent of oil, and 6.6 percent of fuel. They also completed heavy repair work on their own in a very short time. The initiative of the crew of this advanced tanker was soon enthusiastically responded to by the sailors of the Far East shipping fleet. Staff members of the liners "Soviet" and "Ivan Turgenev" also organized Stakhanovite work teams and plunged into the heated competition movement.
