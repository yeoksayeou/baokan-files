    The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League convened its Third School Work Conference in mid-March. More than 50 people attended the meeting, including the heads of the school work departments of the Youth League committees in major administrative regions and some provinces and cities, as well as secretaries of grassroots Youth League organizations in some universities. The meeting lasted for eleven days.

    The conference heard reports on school education work from Cheng Jinwu, Deputy Director of the School Education Department of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Huang Songling, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, and Liu Shi, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. It heard about the experiences of the Youth League Committee of Tsinghua University and the Youth League organization of the Affiliated Women's Middle School of Beijing Normal University in carrying out ideological and political education in schools. Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also gave important instructions at the meeting. Finally, Kang Nai'er, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, made a summary of the meeting.

    In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the meeting reviewed the work of the League in schools and concluded that, thanks to the strengthening of the Party committees' leadership over the League, the work of the League in schools has made great progress and achievements since the Third Plenary Session. The Youth League organizations in schools have taken assisting the Party and the administration in improving learning as their central task. Youth League members generally play an active and exemplary role in learning. The majority of students have recognized that learning is the students' "more particularly prominent task." Enthusiasm for learning has increased compared to the past, and academic performance has gradually improved.

    The meeting focused on reflecting the existing problems in school work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The more prominent problems include: 1. There are shortcomings in ideological and political work, such as simple and rigid methods. Some schools even apply some of the erroneous practices of social reform movements, rudely treating students with backward ideas, making the school atmosphere tense, and students unable to concentrate on learning. 2. Some school Youth League organizations use movement-style methods to promote learning, launching challenge and competition campaigns, making overly urgent and high demands on learning, or overemphasizing the collective, universally forming mutual aid groups, affecting the normal progress of learning. 3. The phenomenon of busyness and disorder in schools has not yet been corrected. There are too many student associations and organizations, too many meetings, and too many activities that hinder learning. 4. The poor health of students is still quite common, thus reducing students' learning effectiveness. Although the severity of the above problems and the speed of their resolution vary from region to region, they still exist to varying degrees and must be further resolved.

    The meeting discussed the situation and problems reflected by various regions, combined with the reports heard at the meeting. The meeting concluded that: Although the above problems have various causes, on the Youth League side, the main reason is that the Youth League organizations in some schools have not yet fully implemented the spirit of the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, lack sufficient understanding of the tasks of the League in schools in the current situation, lack experience in how to improve learning, and have blindness and impatience in their work. They inherit the old methods of engaging in movements to do their work, causing various activities to deviate from learning.

    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, gave important instructions in response to the above problems. He first analyzed the current situation, explained the significance of school education work, and pointed out that in order to assist the Party and school administration in running schools well and cultivating talents with both moral integrity and ability and sound physical health, the central task of the Youth League in schools is to assist the Party and administration in improving learning. In order to improve learning, it is necessary to appropriately assist the Party in doing a good job in political work. Currently, political work in schools must be improved and strengthened. Youth League cadres in schools should understand how to use the method of patient persuasion and education, and be good at carrying out work according to the different specific circumstances of each school and each student. Comrade Hu Yaobang further instructed that the League should assist the Party in doing a good job in political work. To this end, attention must be paid to two points: First, League cadres should frequently understand the situation and ideological trends of students, and should strive to study theory and policies. If they understand the situation and understand the principles, it will be easy to do a good job; Second, it is necessary to educate League members well, carry out political work to the broad masses through League members, and give play to the organizational role of the League. It is necessary to improve the relationship between the League and the masses. Youth League members in schools must strive to become models in learning and other aspects, care about the interests of the masses, humbly learn from the masses, closely contact the masses, and not be arrogant or domineering.

    Regarding the work of the School Work Department of the Communist Youth League, Comrade Hu Yaobang instructed: It is imperative to reduce those dispensable instructions, plans, meetings, etc.; we should deeply understand and reflect the situation, discover problems, study problems, discover typical examples, and use typical examples to promote work. Finally, Comrade Hu Yaobang particularly emphasized that school Youth League cadres should promote honesty in their ideological style; promote down-to-earthness in their work style; and promote democracy in their leadership style.

    During the meeting, the participating comrades more clearly recognized that the Youth League organizations in schools must take assisting the Party and the administration in improving learning as their overriding central task. At the same time, the participating comrades further understood the Party's education policies and the educational reform policies and steps of the education administrative departments. Everyone felt greatly encouraged by the Party and the government's concern for the Youth League and unanimously expressed their determination to further advance the work of the Youth League in schools in accordance with the instructions of Comrade Hu Yaobang and the spirit of the meeting.

    青年团中央召开第三次学校工作会议
    明确认识协助党和行政搞好学习是学校团组织压倒一切的中心任务
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会于三月中旬召开了第三次学校工作会议。参加会议的有各大行政区和部分省、市团委学校工作部部长及部分高等学校青年团基层组织书记等五十余人。会议共开了十一天。
    会议听取了中国共产党中央委员会宣传部学校教育处程今吾副处长、中央人民政府高等教育部黄松龄副部长、中央人民政府教育部柳湜副部长等有关学校教育工作的报告。听取了青年团清华大学委员会和北京师范大学附属女子中学团组织在学校中进行思想政治教育的经验。青年团中央书记胡耀邦并在会上作了重要指示。会议最后由青年团中央秘书长康乃尔作了总结。
    会议根据青年团三中全会的精神，检查了团在学校中的工作，认为由于各级党委加强了对团的领导，团在学校中的工作自三中全会以来有了很大的进步和成绩。学校中的团组织已把协助党和行政搞好学习作为自己的中心任务，青年团员一般能在学习中起积极的模范作用，广大学生认识到了学习是学生“更加特别突出的任务”，学习积极性较前提高，学业成绩已逐步上升。
    会议以批评和自我批评的精神着重反映了目前学校工作中所存在的问题，其中比较突出的有：一、在思想政治工作中存在着方式简单生硬的缺点，有些学校甚至搬用社会改革运动中的一些错误的做法，粗暴地对待思想落后的学生，使学校空气紧张，学生不能安心学习；二、有些学校青年团组织用搞运动的办法来推动学习，发动挑战、竞赛等突击运动，对学习提出过急过高的要求，或者过分强调集体，普遍编互助组，影响了学习的正常进行；三、学校中的忙乱现象尚未纠正，学生社团组织机构多，会议多，有碍学习的活动太多。四、学生健康不良的状况，仍然相当普遍地存在；因而降低了学生的学习效果。以上问题，各个地区严重的程度和解决的迟早虽有不同，但都仍然或多或少地存在着，必须进一步加以解决。
    会议根据各地所反映的情况和问题，结合会议中所听取的报告进行了讨论。会议认为：以上问题的产生虽有各方面的原因，但在青年团方面，主要是有些学校中的青年团组织还没有很好地贯彻青年团三中全会决议的精神，对在目前形势下学校团的任务认识不足，对如何搞好学习还缺乏经验，在工作中存在着盲目性和急性病，因袭过去搞运动的一套办法来做工作，使各种活动脱离了学习。
    青年团中央书记胡耀邦针对以上问题，作了重要指示。他首先分析了目前的形势，说明学校教育工作的意义，并指出为了协助党和学校行政方面办好学校，培养德才兼备、体魄健全的人材，青年团在学校中的中心工作是协助党和行政方面搞好学习，为着搞好学习，要适当地协助党搞好政治工作。目前学校中的政治工作必须改进和加强，学校中青年团的干部应该懂得运用耐心说服教育的方法，善于根据每个学校每个同学不同的具体情况来进行工作。胡耀邦同志并进一步指示团要协助党把政治工作做好，为此，必须注意两点：第一、团的干部要经常了解同学的情况和思想动态，并且要努力学习理论、政策。掌握了情况，又懂得了道理，就容易做好工作了；第二、要好好地教育团员，通过团员向广大群众作政治工作，发挥团的组织作用，要改进团和群众的关系，学校中的青年团员务必努力争取成为学习和其他方面的模范，关心群众利益，虚心向群众学习，密切联系群众，不许自高自大，称王称霸。
    关于青年团学校工作部的工作，胡耀邦同志指示：务必减少那些可有可无的指示、计划、会议等等；应该深入了解和反映情况，发现问题，研究问题，发现典型，运用典型推动工作。最后，胡耀邦同志并特别强调指出学校青年团的干部在思想作风上要提倡老实；在工作作风上要提倡踏实；在领导作风上要提倡民主。
    在会议过程中，与会同志更加明确地认识了学校中的青年团组织必须以协助党和行政方面搞好学习作为自己压倒一切的中心任务。同时与会同志进一步领会了党的教育政策和教育行政部门的教育改革的方针和步骤，大家对于党和政府对青年团的关怀，感到很大鼓舞，一致表示决心按照胡耀邦同志的指示及会议的精神，把青年团在学校中的工作向前推进一步。
