Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, New York dispatch: An Associated Press dispatch admits that US coal sales, both domestic and foreign, were greatly reduced last year. The dispatch quotes an estimate that US bituminous coal consumption fell by a total of 61 million tons last year, a decrease of 11.5 percent compared to 1951. Of this decrease, 10 million tons were due to competition from foreign fuels, 9 million tons were due to export difficulties, particularly reduced imports of American coal by Western Europe, and another 42 million tons were due to reduced domestic sales. However, according to "coal mining industry" materials cited in the same dispatch, the sales volume of coal decreased by 31 million tons last year due solely to competition from imported fuel oil, causing more than 32,000 miners to lose their jobs as a result.

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, New York dispatch: United Press International dispatches admit that the US coal mining industry is currently in a slump, with a large number of coal miners unemployed.

UPI reporter Anderson recently sent a dispatch from West Frankfort, Illinois, an important industrial area in the United States, specifically describing the slump in the coal mining industry in Illinois, one of the largest coal-producing states in the United States. Anderson begins his dispatch by saying: "King Coal no longer reigns in Southern Illinois, and leaders in the area are scrambling to find new industries to replace the shattered coal empire." Anderson said: "In the three major towns of Franklin, Williamson, and Saline, in this once coal-rich area, half a dozen coal mines have closed down within a month, and most other mines are only operating two or three days a week."

The large-scale unemployment of workers has also greatly reduced the commercial activity of the entire region. According to Anderson, in West Frankfort, "merchants report that their sales have decreased by 50 percent since January. As for luxury goods, there are almost no buyers," because the "unemployed miners who have been laid off by their employers are reducing their expenses to the lowest level." In order to avoid starvation for their families, unemployed miners "flock" to the state government's so-called "unemployment relief offices" to apply for work or receive a meager amount of "unemployment benefits." Not only is this "relief" not available to everyone, but, as Anderson quotes an unemployed miner as saying, it is simply "not enough to live on." As a result, many unemployed miners have to leave their hometowns and their wives and children to find a way to survive in other areas.

Anderson's dispatch admits that the reason for the slump in the coal mining industry is that "the demand for coal is very small," and one of the reasons for the small demand for coal is that "coal prices are too expensive."

    美国国内外烟煤市场萎缩美大批煤矿工人失业
    【新华社十七日讯】纽约消息：美联社的一则消息承认，美国去年煤的国内外销路大减。这则消息引某方面的估计说，美国烟煤去年的消费量共减少了六千一百万吨，比一九五一年减少了百分之十一·五。减少的原因有一千万吨是因为外国燃料的竞争，九百万吨是因为出口困难，特别是西欧削减美煤入口，另外四千二百万吨是因为国内销路减少。但是据同一则消息引的“煤矿界”材料，去年单是由于入口燃料油的竞争，煤的销售量就减少了三千一百万吨，并使三万二千多矿工因此失业。
    【新华社十七日讯】纽约消息：合众社消息承认，目前美国煤矿业萧条，大批煤矿工人失业。
    合众社记者安德逊最近从美国重要工业区伊利诺斯州的西法兰克福发出消息，具体描述了美国最大的产煤州之一伊利诺斯州煤矿业萧条的情况。安德逊在这条消息里一开头就说：“石炭王已不再统治南伊利诺斯，这个地区的领袖正在拚命找寻新的工业来代替支离破碎的煤矿帝国。”安德逊说：“在这个一度盛产烟煤的地区的三个重镇，佛兰克林、威廉逊和萨莱恩，一个月之内便有半打煤矿倒闭，其他大多矿山每周也只开工两天或三天。”
    大批工人的失业使整个地区的商业也大大衰退。据安德逊说，在西法兰克福的“商人报告说他们的销货量自一月以来已减少了百分之五十。至于奢侈品更是几乎无人问津”，因为被雇主解雇的“失业矿工正在把他们的开支减低到最低的水平”。失业的矿工们为了免得全家饿死，“成群结队”到州政府的所谓“失业救济所”去申请工作或领取少得可怜的一点“失业救济金”，这种“救济”不但并非每人都能领到，而且照安德逊引一个失业矿工的话所形容的，根本“不足糊口”。有许多失业矿工因此不得不离开他们的家乡和他们的妻子儿女，到别的地区去找寻生路。
    安德逊的消息中承认，煤矿业萧条的原因是：“煤的需求很少”，而煤的需求少的原因之一又是“煤价太贵”。
