    Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Water Conservancy Bureau, and Cooperative Leaders Go Deep into Rural Areas to Help Solve Specific Problems in Spring Plowing and Production

    The Northwest Administrative Committee's Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Northwest Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have achieved preliminary results in inspecting spring plowing work.

    Before spring plowing, the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Water Conservancy Bureau, cooperatives, and others, based on the spirit of opposing bureaucracy, determined the key points for inspecting spring plowing work. Cai Ziwei, Deputy Director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee and Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Deputy Director Feng Shixiu, Deputy Directors of the Water Conservancy Bureau Guan Wenqi and Ding Zhongwen, and Chen Naijun, Director of the Northwest Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and other responsible cadres each took charge of key areas and led inspection teams to go deep into rural areas for inspection.

    Currently, spring plowing and sowing work has been fully launched in various parts of the Northwest. During the inspection, each inspection team actively solved specific difficulties and problems in spring plowing and production in various places. Cai Ziwei, Director of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, led workers from the Northwest Agricultural Implement Factory and cadres from relevant units such as the People's Bank and cooperatives to Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, to inspect spring plowing work. When they were at the Cao Zhuxiang mutual aid team, they found that the new-style walking plow purchased by the team had been hanging on the wall unused for a long time; the agricultural implement workers of the inspection team investigated the problem of the walking plow and helped repair it, and the Cao Zhuxiang mutual aid team immediately used it to plow the land. The agricultural implement workers also repaired sprayers and other agricultural implements locally, which was warmly welcomed by the farmers. Now, the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has decided to continue to dispatch agricultural implement workers to the countryside to install and repair various new-style agricultural implements for farmers. Guan Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Northwest Water Conservancy Bureau, and He Shoushan, Director of the Office, and others went to the construction site of the Northwest Water Conservancy Promotion Agency's mechanical drilling team to help establish various systems, mobilize workers to improve technology, discuss work plans, and criticize the bureaucratic leadership style of the agency. As a result, the morale of the drilling team workers was greatly improved. In the past twenty days, they completed a deep well of six hundred and ninety feet, doubling their work efficiency compared to the past and saving a large amount of fuel and materials.

    西北农林局、水利局、合作社领导干部深入农村帮助解决春耕生产中的具体问题
    西北行政委员会农林局、水利局和全国合作总社西北办事处，检查春耕工作已有初步收获。
    春耕前，西北农林局、水利局、合作社等根据反对官僚主义的精神，确定了检查春耕工作的重点。西北财经委员会副主任兼农林局局长蔡子伟、副局长冯士休、水利局副局长关文启、丁仲文、全国合作总社西北办事处主任陈乃君等负责干部都分别掌握重点，率领检查组深入农村检查。
    目前，西北各地春耕播种工作已全面展开。各检查组在检查中，积极解决各地春耕生产中的具体困难问题。西北农林局局长蔡子伟率领西北农具厂工人和人民银行、合作社等有关单位干部，到陕西省渭南县检查春耕工作。他们在曹竹香互助组时，发现该组所贷购的新式步犁长期挂在墙上不用；检查组的农具工人便查明步犁的毛病，并帮助修理好，曹竹香互助组立即用来犁地。农具工人还在当地修理了喷雾器和其他农具，受到农民的热烈欢迎。现在，西北农林局已决定继续抽调农具工人下乡，给农民安装和修理各种新式农具。西北水利局副局长关文启和办公室主任贺寿山等，到西北水利推进社机械钻井队的工地，帮助建立各种制度，发动工人改进技术，讨论工作计划，并批判了该社官僚主义的领导作风。因此，钻井队工人情绪大大提高，在最近二十天内就完成了六百九十英尺的深井一眼，工作效率比过去提高一倍，并节省了大批的燃料和材料。（新华社）
