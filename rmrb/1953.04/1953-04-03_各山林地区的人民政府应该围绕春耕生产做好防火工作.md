    People's Governments in All Mountainous and Forest Areas Should Do a Good Job of Fire Prevention Centered on Spring Plowing Production
    Reader Yang Shu writes: Songjiang Province is one of the major forest areas in the country, and forest fire prevention is a very important task locally. This spring, the provincial people's government has already made a series of arrangements for forest fire prevention and has organized cadres to conduct inspections in coordination with spring plowing. However, some county and district people's governments only paid attention to spring plowing production and completely neglected forest fire prevention, resulting in many mountain fire accidents. For example, a fire occurred in the mountains and forests of Wusihun Village, Gucheng District, Linkou County. The local people's government mobilized more than 2,000 people to put out the fire, which destroyed 20,000 saplings and nearly burned into the large forest. Other counties such as Huachuan, Mishan, Jixi, Hailin, Acheng, and Dongning have also experienced fires of varying sizes this year. This not only caused serious losses to state property, but also delayed farmers' spring plowing due to firefighting. Therefore, I suggest that the people's governments in all mountainous and forest areas across the country pay attention to this issue and should do a good job of fire prevention centered on spring plowing production.

    各山林地区的人民政府应该围绕春耕生产做好防火工作
    读者杨枢来信：松江省是全国主要林区之一，护林防火是当地一件十分重要的工作。今年春季，该省人民政府对护林防火工作已经作了一系列的布置，并组织了干部配合春耕工作进行检查。但是有
    一些县、区人民政府却只顾春耕生产而完全忽视了护林防火工作，结果就发生了不少烧山事故。如林口县古城区乌斯浑村山林发生火灾，当地人民政府动员了二千多人抢救才将火扑灭，结果烧掉幼树两万棵，险些烧进大森林。其它如桦川、密山、鸡西、海林、阿城、东宁等县今年也都发生过大小火灾。这不但使国家财产受到严重损失；并且还因救火而耽误了农民的春耕。因此，我建议全国各山林地区的人民政府注意这个问题，应该围绕着春耕生产工作把防火工作也搞好。
