    Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: With the continuous growth of production, the material and cultural life of Soviet workers has become better year by year since the war. In 1952, the average real income of Soviet workers increased to 1.68 times that of the pre-war year 1940; by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it will further increase to 2.12 times that of 1940. That is to say, if the average real income of a Soviet worker was 10,000 rubles in 1940, then it would be 16,800 rubles in 1952; and it will be 21,200 rubles in 1955. The increase in the real income of Soviet workers is the result of the gradual increase in monetary wages, the planned reduction of prices for food and daily necessities, and the annual increase in state appropriations for cultural and welfare undertakings for them. From 1946 to 1952, the monetary wages of Soviet workers increased by about 50 percent. Taking the workers of the Ordzhonikidze Machine Manufacturing Plant in Moscow as an example, their average monthly wage in 1952 was more than double that of 1940. Since the war, the Soviet Union has reduced prices six times. After the fifth price reduction in 1952, the average price of food and daily necessities in the Soviet Union has been reduced by half compared with the fourth quarter of 1947. The recently implemented sixth price reduction has further reduced the prices of various foods and daily necessities in the Soviet Union by 5 to 50 percent compared with 1952. Bread, which was worth 1 ruble in 1947, can now be bought for only 36 kopecks (1 ruble equals 100 kopecks). The Soviet government's appropriations for cultural and welfare undertakings for workers and other working people were 40.8 billion rubles in 1940, and have increased to 129 billion rubles in 1952. These state appropriations enable Soviet workers to receive various social insurance allowances and subsidies, obtain pensions, receive free medical care, free education and professional training, and their children can enter childcare institutions free of charge or at low cost. Female workers with many children can also receive special allowances, etc. Soviet workers enjoy paid vacations of two weeks to two months each year, and they can go to sanatoriums or rest homes built in scenic spots for vacation, with all or most of the expenses borne by the state. The number of Soviet sanatoriums and rest homes has increased from 830 in 1946 to more than 2,000 now. Among them, about 1,300 belong to Soviet trade unions. Generally speaking, the state's appropriations for workers' cultural and welfare undertakings increase their income by about 35 percent in addition to their monetary wages. In addition, from 1946 to 1952, more than 155 million square meters of housing were built in Soviet cities and workers' residential areas, many of which are magnificent apartments for workers to live in. If Soviet workers voluntarily build houses, they can borrow long-term housing loans from the state. Many industrial enterprises have also built comfortable new houses and sell them to workers at half price, and the workers can pay off the amount in ten years, while the other half is borne by the state. In addition to using part of their abundant income to purchase the items they need, Soviet workers often deposit part of it in banks. In 1952, the deposit amount in Soviet savings banks was four times that of 1940, and many of the depositors are workers. For example, workers in Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Republic, deposited more than 160 million rubles in the savings banks of Minsk city and the state in 1952; in the first quarter of this year, their deposits increased by about 10 million rubles.
    In terms of cultural life, the number of Soviet workers who learn new technologies or improve their own technologies through individual or collective education in their spare time, or by attending spare-time refresher courses, increases year by year. In 1952, this number was more than one million more than in 1946. From 1946 to 1952, this number averaged about 6.6 million people per year. The Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant is a good example. Last year, about 4,000 workers from this factory participated in the "Stakhanov School," and more than 7,000 people improved their skills through this method or other spare-time learning methods; this year, 3,000 workers participated in the "Seven-Year Labor Youth School," 450 people entered two technical night schools, and more than 500 people entered engineering college night schools and higher correspondence schools, and more workers participated in the "Stakhanov School" than last year. Soviet workers have many cultural palaces and clubs. These cultural palaces and clubs have more than 8,000 film screening halls, and last year there were more than 444.4 million moviegoers. This year, the network of Soviet workers' cultural and recreational institutions will continue to expand. For example, 30 magnificent cultural palaces and clubs will be newly built for miners to enjoy, and 18 beautiful clubs will be built for railway workers. Last year, Soviet workers had more than 40,000 amateur theater troupes and more than 50,000 amateur music groups, and these groups performed more than 700,000 performances.

    苏联工人的生活一年比一年好
    【新华社二十八日讯】随着生产的不断增长，战后苏联工人的物质和文化生活一年比一年更加美好。一九五二年苏联工人平均每人的实际收入增加为战前一九四○年的一点六八倍；到第五个五年计划终了时，将进一步增加为一九四○年的二点一二倍。即是说，苏联工人平均每人每年的实际收入在一九四○年若为一万卢布，那么，在一九五二年就有一万六千八百卢布；到一九五五年将有二万一千二百卢布。苏联工人实际收入的增加，是由于货币工资逐步增加、食品和日用品有计划地减价和国家为他们举办文化福利事业的拨款年年增多的结果。从一九四六年到一九五二年，苏联工人的货币工资约增加了百分之五十。以莫斯科奥尔忠尼启则机器制造厂的工人来说，他们平均每月工资一九五二年就比一九四○年增加了一倍多。战后苏联已六次减低物价，一九五二年第五次减低物价后，苏联食品和日用品价格平均已比一九四七年第四季降低了一半。最近实行的第六次减低物价又使苏联各种食品和日用品价格比一九五二年分别减低百分之五到五十。在一九四七年值一卢布的面包，现在只要三十六戈比（一卢布合一百戈比）就可以买到了。苏联政府为工人及其他劳动人民兴办文化福利事业的拨款在一九四○年为四百零八亿卢布，一九五二年已增为一千二百九十亿卢布。国家的这类拨款使苏联工人可以领取各种社会保险的津贴和补助费，取得养老金，免费受医疗，免费受教育及专业训练，他们的子女免费或低费进教养机关，儿女众多的女工还可以领到专门的津贴等等。苏联工人每年享有两个星期到两个月工资照付的假期，他们可以到建筑在风景迷人的名胜区的疗养院或休养所度假，其全部或大部费用由国家负担。苏联疗养院、休养所的数目已由一九四六年的八百三十个增加到现在的二千多个。其中约一千三百个属于苏联工会。一般说来，国家为工人的文化福利事业的拨款使他们在货币工资以外增加了约百分之三十五的收入。此外，从一九四六年到一九五二年，苏联各城市和工人居住区建筑了居住面积达一亿五千五百多万平方公尺的房屋，其中许多都是供工人居住的华丽的公寓房屋。苏联工人如自愿建筑住宅，可以向国家借贷长期的房屋贷款。还有许多工业企业都盖了舒适的新住宅，以半价出售给工人，工人可以分十年付清款项，而另一半费用则由国家负担。苏联工人富裕的收入除了一部分用来购置所需要的物品以外，还经常拿一部分储蓄在银行里。一九五二年苏联储蓄银行的存款额相当于一九四○年的四倍，其中许多存户都是工人。例如白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克的工人，一九五二年就在明斯克市和州的储蓄银行存了一亿六千多万卢布；在今年第一季，他们的存款又增加了约一千万卢布。
    在文化生活方面，苏联工人因业余个别的或集体的教育、或进业余进修班而学会新技术或提高了本身技术的人数年年增加。一九五二年这项人数比一九四六年多一百多万人。从一九四六年到一九五二年这项人数平均每年约为六百六十万人。乌拉尔重型机械制造厂就是一个很好的例子。这个工厂去年约有四千工人参加了“斯大哈诺夫学校”，共有七千多人经由这个办法或其他业余学习办法提高了技术；今年有三千工人参加了“七年制劳动青年学校”，四百五十人进了两个技术夜校，五百多人进了工程学院夜校和高等函授学校，还有比去年更多的工人参加了“斯大哈诺夫学校”。苏联工人拥有许多文化宫和俱乐部。这些文化宫和俱乐部设有八千多个电影放映厅，去年共有电影观众四亿四千四百多万人次。今年苏联工人文娱机关网还要继续扩大，例如将新建三十幢宏伟美丽的文化宫和俱乐部供矿工们享用，将为铁路工人建筑十八幢华美的俱乐部。去年苏联工人共有四万多个业余剧团和五万多个业余音乐团体，这些团体演出了七十多万场。
