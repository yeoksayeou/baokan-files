    Beijing's state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private businesses are actively preparing materials to meet the needs of the capital's people during the "May Day" Labor Day holiday.
    In early April, Beijing's state-owned specialized companies studied holiday goods supply plans and have begun to transport goods. The grain company's shipments of flour and rice have doubled compared to last year's "May Day" holiday. The cotton and linen company has prepared a large quantity of various colors of gabardine and twill fabric, which are the most popular among the people of the capital, with a quantity increase of more than 30% compared to last year. The department stores' shelves are filled with various poplin shirts and vests recently shipped from Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, as well as a large number of uniforms, leather shoes, and cosmetic products. Cooperatives, native product companies, and private businesses have prepared 3,000 head of fat pigs and a large quantity of beef, mutton, apples, oranges, bananas, and other fruits, which are being transported from the Northeast and Jiangnan regions. The cooperatives have also purchased tens of thousands of catties of fresh eggs. Other items such as cooking oil and wine have also been fully prepared by the relevant specialized companies. The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce has called on private businesses to do a good job in supplying goods for the holiday.
    To celebrate this holiday, Beijing's state-owned trading companies and cooperatives have decided to offer a 5% discount for three days on April 30th, May 2nd, and 3rd. (Xinhua News Agency)
