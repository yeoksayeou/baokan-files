The Beijing Municipal Committee for the Marriage Law Movement began key trial work on implementing the Marriage Law in eleven locations starting in December of last year. These included the No. 4 Sewing Department of the Beijing Clothing Factory, Chengzikuang Mine, the jurisdiction of the Dongdan District Suianbo Hutong, Xidan District Xueyuan Hutong, Xisi District Gongxian Hutong, and Qianmen District Xiheyan police stations, as well as Ciyunsi Village and Yaojiayuan Village in the eastern suburbs, Yanjaitai Village in the Beijing West Mining Area, Peking University Medical College, and the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China. These trials have now concluded one after another, and some achievements have been made.

Since liberation and before this movement, arranged and forced marriages in Beijing have decreased significantly, while autonomous and semi-autonomous marriages have increased significantly. Among the married employees of the Clothing Factory No. 4 and Chengzikuang Mine, arranged and forced marriages accounted for 70% before liberation, but have decreased to 20% after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. In the three well alleys and other five hutongs in the urban area, among 744 households, the number of autonomous marriages has increased from 15% before liberation to 51% now. However, because the publicity of the Marriage Law has not been frequent and thorough enough in the past, the phenomena of interfering with freedom of marriage and abusing and beating women are still quite serious. According to statistics from 182 households in the San Yan Jing Hutong, Qianmen District, only 5.7% of families are democratic and harmonious, while families that seriously interfere with freedom of marriage and abuse women still account for 4.3%. Gender inequality, discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, or "harmonious" families based on "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" account for 90%. In factories and mines, freedom of marriage is often interfered with and obstructed by backward masses, and the phenomenon of workers beating their wives is still quite common. Among faculty, staff, and students in general schools, there are also many unhappy families. In the past, almost none of them had studied the Marriage Law properly, and they could not clearly distinguish the ideological boundaries between the old and new marriage systems. At the beginning of the movement to implement the Marriage Law, the masses had various concerns, fears, and resistant emotions.

Through the key trials, the publicity work of the Marriage Law has basically been carried out to every household, and the broad masses have generally received an education on the Marriage Law. They understand that the Marriage Law aims to achieve freedom of marriage, gender equality, family harmony, and unity in production, which is beneficial to individuals, families, the country, and future generations. Therefore, they all warmly support the Marriage Law. The masses have solved many marriage problems and family disputes through self-education methods such as holding family meetings. All 54 disharmonious families in Clothing Factory No. 4 have become harmonious after the movement. The phenomena of beating women and family discord in streets and villages have also been greatly reduced. In the jurisdiction of the Suianbo Hutong Police Station in Dongdan District, there were originally 68 disharmonious families, and now 33 of them have been fundamentally changed or are beginning to change. Zhang Hui, a worker at Clothing Factory No. 4, used to quarrel with his wife frequently and had no intention of working. In the second half of December last year, he only completed seven days of his quota in thirteen days and only received 89,000 yuan in wages. After improving his relationship with his wife through the movement, his family became harmonious, and he was very motivated to produce. In the second half of January this year, he overfulfilled his production task by 35%. After some peasant masses in the suburbs reconciled with their families, they immediately held family meetings and formulated production increase plans.

According to the experience of the key trials in Beijing, in order to make the movement develop correctly and healthily, it is necessary to first explain the nature, purpose, principles, and policies of the movement to the cadres, explain what problems need to be solved and how to solve them, and promptly criticize and correct the cadres' impetuous emotions and other unhealthy emotions. In this key trial, the impetuous emotions displayed by the cadres were: more emphasis on punishment than education, more emphasis on criticism than praise, and more emphasis on finding bad people, bad deeds, and bad typical examples than on finding good people, good deeds, and good typical examples. Some cadres considered the marriage problems among the masses, especially the abuse of women, very broadly, and also regarded widows who did not remarry, divorcees who did not remarry, and old maids as problems. Some cadres had rigid working methods, almost resorting to coercion and commandism. Some cadres raised the question of "who to rely on" in the movement. This impetuous emotion once caused the people to misunderstand the movement. Secondly, it is necessary to publicize the Marriage Law to the masses in a positive and comprehensive way to eliminate their concerns, misunderstandings, resistance, and fears. Do not start with criticism at the beginning to avoid further increasing the masses' concerns. In every link of the movement, it is necessary to grasp the ideological situation among the masses and solve the main ideological problems among the masses in order to promote the movement. At the beginning, it should be explained to the masses that the movement to implement the Marriage Law is to help everyone have a harmonious family and unite in production, rather than creating gender opposition, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law opposition, and family discord, and to enable the masses to distinguish the boundaries between the old and new marriage systems. When the movement goes deeper, the idea of ​​valuing men over women should be criticized, and the principle of gender equality should be publicized from all aspects. Among them, a more effective method is to summarize the achievements of local women in actively participating in labor production and social activities, and explain the important position of women in the family and society.

Fully training cadres, clarifying their thinking, and improving their ideological and policy levels are the keys to correctly carrying out the movement. The village chief of Yaojiayuan Village did not dare to support Zhao Youzhen, a child bride who was abused, at the beginning of the work. Zhao Youzhen ran to the village office and did not dare to go home, and the village chief did not dare to keep her either, and forced her to go back. After studying the policies and clarifying his thinking, he reviewed his past mistakes and actively supported Zhao Youzhen. The women's committee member of the village was a widow, and she had concerns at the beginning of the trial work, and her work was not active. After fully understanding the policies, she actively participated in the publicity work and did a great job.

In terms of organization and leadership, the responsible comrades must mobilize from the inside to the outside, from the top to the bottom, and mobilize and organize all possible forces to participate in the movement, and implement the division of labor and responsibility according to the system. At the same time, they must grasp a part of capable cadres who can go deep into the lower levels, discover problems in time, and summarize experience, so that the leaders can always grasp the development of the movement, promote experience in time, and correct deviations.

Typical reports of living people and living deeds are an effective way to make propaganda penetrate the hearts of the people. However, attention must be paid to whether they are representative and whether they can comprehensively or in a certain important aspect show the policy and educate the masses when selecting typical examples. The typical figures selected to make reports must be willing to do so themselves and have the consent of their families, and cadres must never designate them by order. After the typical report, the masses should be organized to discuss and compare the new and old marriage systems with concrete facts, so that the masses can consciously and voluntarily learn from good typical examples.

On the basis of fairly in-depth publicity work, the masses should be mobilized to summarize the gains of the movement and put forward concrete calls for regularly implementing the Marriage Law in the future to consolidate the results of the movement. Family meetings and family covenants can be adopted, but they cannot be universally called for, let alone designated for every family to implement. Doing so will inevitably lead to formalism and coercion. At the end of the movement, organizing cadres to conduct a study and discussion on "caring about the lives of the masses" is of positive significance for strengthening the cadres' mass concept and laying the foundation for future work.

    北京市贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作取得成绩
    北京市贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室
    北京市贯彻婚姻法运动委员会从去年十二月份开始，在北京被服厂第四缝纫部，城子矿，东单区遂安伯胡同，西单区学院胡同，西四区弓弦胡同，前门区西河沿等派出所管界，东郊区慈云寺村、姚家园村，京西矿区燕家台村，北京大学医学院，中国人民银行北京分行等十一处进行贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作，现已先后结束，并取得了一些成绩。
    解放以后至此次运动以前，北京市包办买卖婚姻已显著减少，自主和半自主婚姻显著增加。被服四厂和城子矿的已婚职工中，解放前包办买卖婚姻占百分之七十，婚姻法颁布后，已减少到百分之二十；城区三眼井等五条胡同七百四十四户中，婚姻自主的已由解放前的百分之十五增加到现在的百分之五十一。但是，由于过去对婚姻法的宣传不够经常与深入，所以干涉婚姻自由、虐待打骂妇女的现象仍然相当严重。据前门区三眼井胡同一百八十二户统计，民主和睦的家庭只占百分之五点七，严重干涉婚姻自由和虐待妇女的家庭还占百分之四点三，男女不平等，婆媳不和睦，或是在“三从四德”的基础上“和睦”的家庭占了百分之九十。在厂矿中，婚姻自由也往往受到落后群众的干涉和阻挠，工人打骂老婆的现象还相当普遍。在一般学校的教职员和学生中，家庭不和的也很多，过去差不多都没有好好学习过婚姻法，划不清新旧婚姻制度的思想界限。在贯彻婚姻法运动开始时，群众中有各种顾虑、恐惧和抵触情绪。
    经过重点试验的地区和单位，婚姻法的宣传工作基本上作到了家喻户晓，广大群众已普遍受到了一次婚姻法的教育，懂得了婚姻法是要达到婚姻自由、男女平等、家庭和睦、团结生产，对个人、家庭、国家以及后代子孙都有好处，因此都热烈拥护婚姻法。群众中通过开家庭会等自我教育方式，解决了不少婚姻问题和家庭纠纷。被服四厂五十四个不和睦的家庭，经过运动都和睦了。街道、农村中打骂妇女和家庭不和的现象也大大减少了。东单区遂安伯胡同派出所管界中，原来有六十八户家庭不和，现在已有三十三户根本改观或开始转变了。被服四厂工人张譓过去经常与老婆吵架，无心生产，去年十二月下半月十三天只完成七天定额，仅领八九万元工资；经过运动改善了夫妻关系，家庭和睦了，生产劲头很大，今年一月份下半月就超额完成生产任务百分之三十五。郊区一些农民群众家庭和好后，马上开家庭会议，订增产计划。
    根据北京市重点试验工作的经验，要使运动正确地、健康地开展，必须首先向干部交代清楚运动的性质、目的、方针和政策，说明要解决些甚么问题，如何解决，及时批判纠正干部中的急躁情绪和其他不健康情绪。在此次重点试验中，干部表现的急躁情绪是：惩办的劲头比教育的劲头大，批评的劲头比表扬的劲头大，找坏人坏事坏典型的劲头比找好人好事好典型的劲头大；有的把群众中的婚姻问题尤其是虐待妇女问题算得很宽，把寡妇不改嫁、离婚不再嫁、老姑娘等也算成问题；有的是工作方式生硬，近乎强迫命令；有的提出在运动中“依靠谁”的问题。这种急躁情绪曾使人民群众对运动发生误解。其次，要正面地、全面地向群众宣传婚姻法，消除群众的顾虑、误解、抵触和恐惧情绪；不要一开始就进行批判，以免更增加群众的顾虑。在运动的每一环节上，都要掌握群众中的思想情况，解决群众中的主要思想问题，才能推动运动。开始时应向群众说明贯彻婚姻法运动是要帮助大家家庭和睦、团结生产，而不是造成男女对立、婆媳对立、家庭不和，并使群众划清新旧婚姻界限。运动深入一步时，就应批判重男轻女的思想，从各方面宣传男女平等的原则。其中较有效的办法，是总结当地妇女积极参加劳动生产与社会活动的成就，说明妇女在家庭和社会中的重要地位。
    充分训练干部，打通干部思想，提高干部思想水平和政策水平，是正确地开展运动的关键。姚家园村村长在工作初期对受虐待的童养媳赵幼贞不敢支持，赵幼贞跑到村公所，不敢回家，村长也不敢留，硬叫她回去。以后学习了政策，思想打通了以后，检讨了过去的错误，并积极支持了赵幼贞。该村妇女委员是寡妇，试验工作初期有顾虑，工作不积极，在全面了解了政策以后，就积极地参加了宣传工作，而且做得很有成绩。
    组织领导方面，负责同志要从内到外，从上到下的进行动员，动员与组织一切可能的力量参加运动，按系统实行分工负责；同时必须掌握一部分能深入下层、及时发现问题、总结经验的得力干部，使领导者能经常掌握运动开展的情况，及时推广经验，纠正偏向。
    活人活事的典型报告是使宣传深入人心的有效方法。但是选择典型时必须注意是否有代表性，是否能全面地或在某一重要方面显示政策，教育群众。选择其作报告的典型人物，必须是本人自愿，家庭同意的，决不能由干部以命令指定。典型报告后，应组织群众讨论，以具体事实对比新旧婚姻制度，使群众自觉自愿地向好的典型学习。
    在宣传工作已相当深入的基础上，应发动群众总结运动的收获，并提出今后经常贯彻婚姻法的具体号召，巩固运动的成果。家庭会议和家庭公约是可以采用的，但是不能普遍号召，更不能指定家家实行，这样做必然会发生形式主义和强迫命令现象。在运动结束时，组织干部进行一次“关心群众生活”的学习和讨论，这对加强干部的群众观念和为今后工作打下基础有积极意义。
