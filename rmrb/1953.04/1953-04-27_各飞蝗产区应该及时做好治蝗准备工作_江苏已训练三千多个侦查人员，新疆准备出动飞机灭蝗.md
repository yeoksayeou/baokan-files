The Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a "Locust Outbreak Forecast for 1953" on the 23rd, requesting all locust-producing areas to promptly make preparations for locust control in order to seize favorable opportunities to eliminate locusts. The forecast stated: In locust-producing provinces, including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and others, locust eggs were surveyed last winter and this spring. According to incomplete statistics, the area covered by eggs reached more than 3.2 million mu. The density of locust eggs is generally five to ten egg masses per square zhang, with the largest reaching more than 2,000 masses, and each mass containing approximately eighty eggs. The overwintering mortality rate of locust eggs is very low: in Gaogengdi, Suxian Prefecture, Anhui Province, it is 10 percent, and in low-lying areas, it is 20 to 30 percent; in the Weishan Lake area at the junction of Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, it is only 1 to 7 percent. Currently, some areas have experienced drought, and some flooded areas have receded, with areas containing locust eggs about to begin hatching. According to meteorological forecasts, there is a possibility of drought this year, and therefore, the severity of locust outbreaks will also increase. The forecast requires all locust-producing areas to raise a high degree of vigilance, promptly make all preparations for locust control, and, starting from the end of April, conduct thorough inspections of locust egg hatching. They should complete the training of pesticide and equipment operators, and immediately establish locust control headquarters, systematically allocate sufficient manpower and resources, and while carrying out propaganda and education, seize favorable opportunities to eliminate nymphs before the third instar to ensure they do not spread and cause harm.

The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government is leading farmers to actively prepare for the prevention and control of locust plagues. More than 3,500 scouts have been trained in nineteen counties, including Gaoyou, Tongbei, and Guanyun, and reconnaissance work has been completed in major locust areas. The areas in Jiangsu Province where locusts have occurred in previous years are reed滩lands along the Yellow Sea, Weishan Lake, Gaoyou Lake, and Hongze Lake. This year, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government decided to adopt different methods for locust control according to different regions: in areas where soil locusts and rice locusts occur, manual extermination will be the main method; in areas where locust plagues are severe, sparsely populated, pesticides will be the main method, supplemented by manual labor, to thoroughly eliminate locust nymphs before the third instar. At present, the training of technicians in the use of pesticides has been completed, and 1.5 million jin of "666" insecticide powder and more than 3,500 powder sprayers have been transported. Locust control stations have been established in Xuzhou, Xin Hai Lian, Huaiyin, Gaoyou and other places. Each county will establish a locust control headquarters to strengthen leadership in locust control work.

The Xinjiang Provincial Locust Control Headquarters was established on the 20th, with Baurhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, serving as the director. The headquarters is now actively preparing to dispatch aircraft for locust control, in order to gradually eradicate locust plagues and ensure agricultural harvests.

Within the borders of nine counties in Xinjiang Province, including Dihua, Suilai, Jinghua, Changji, Qandeq, Fukang, Usu, Shawan, and Heshuo, there are many reed lakes. Locusts lay eggs and breed in the reed lakes, harming nearby fields and pastures year after year. The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government investigated locust egg-laying conditions last winter and decided this year to focus on the above-mentioned nine counties as key locust control areas. These areas will mainly use aircraft for locust control, supplemented by manual spraying of pesticide powder and catching; it is required that the land area for locust control reach more than 960,000 mu.

Currently, there are eight aircraft prepared for locust control, and the required 520,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder is nearing completion of processing. In addition, 52,600 jin of sodium arsenate and calcium arsenate, 489 manual powder sprayers and sprayers, and 6 horsepower powder sprayers, which have been prepared, will be transported to key locust control areas in early May.

    各飞蝗产区应该及时做好治蝗准备工作
    江苏已训练三千多个侦查人员，新疆准备出动飞机灭蝗
    中央人民政府农业部植物保护司在二十三日发出“一九五三年飞蝗发生情况预报”，要求各飞蝗产区及时作好治蝗的准备工作，以便掌握有利时机消灭蝗虫。预报中说：飞蝗产区各省，包括河北、河南、山东、安徽、江苏、新疆等省，都在去冬今春侦查了蝗卵。据不完全统计，卵面积达三百二十余万亩。蝗卵密度一般每平方丈有卵五块至十块，最大的有卵达二千多块，每块有卵约八十粒。蝗卵过冬死亡率很低：在安徽省宿县专区高埂地为百分之十，低洼地为百分之二十至三十；在山东、江苏两省交界微山湖地区仅为百分之一至百分之七。现在，有些地区已发生旱象，部分水淹地亦已退水，其中有蝗卵的地区即将开始孵化；按气象预测，今年有干旱的可能，因此，飞蝗发生的严重性也将随之加大。预报要求各飞蝗产区提起高度警惕，及时作好治蝗的一切准备工作，从四月底开始普遍进行蝗卵孵化情况的严密检查，完成药械手的训练，并即刻成立治蝗指挥部，有计划有步骤地配备足够的人力、物力，一面做好宣传教育工作，一面掌握有利时机消灭蝻子于三龄以前，保证不使蔓延为害。

    江苏省人民政府领导农民积极准备防治蝗虫灾害。高邮、铜北、灌云等十九个县训练了三千五百多名侦查人员，在主要蝗区作好了清察工作。江苏省历年发生蝗虫的地区是黄海沿岸、微山湖、高邮湖、洪泽湖等芦苇滩地。今年江苏省人民政府决定按照不同地区，采取不同方法防治蝗害：在土蝗稻蝗发生的地区，以人工扑灭为主；在蝗虫灾害严重、地广人稀的地区，以药剂为主，人工为辅，在蝗蝻三龄以前彻底扑灭。目前各地训练使用药剂的技术人员已告结束，并运到一百五十万斤“六六六”杀虫药粉和三千五百多架喷粉器。徐州、新海连、淮阴、高邮等地都设立了治蝗站。各县将成立治蝗指挥部，加强治蝗工作的领导。    （新华社）
    新疆省治蝗指挥部已在二十日成立，由新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉任主任。该指挥部现正积极准备出动飞机治蝗，以求得逐步根除蝗灾，保证农田丰收。
    新疆省迪化、绥来、景化、昌吉、乾德、阜康、乌苏、沙湾、和硕等九县境内，有许多苇湖。蝗虫在苇湖中产卵滋长，年年危害附近的田禾和牧草。新疆省人民政府在去年冬天调查了蝗虫产卵情况，今年决定以上述九县为重点治蝗区。这些地区将以飞机治蝗为主，辅助以人工喷撒药粉和捕打；要求防治蝗害的土地面积达到九十六万多亩。
    现在，准备出动治蝗的飞机有八架，所需的“六六六”药粉五十二万斤即将加工完毕。此外，已经准备好的砒酸钠、砒酸钙五万二千六百斤，人力喷粉器、喷雾器四百八十九架、马力喷粉机六架等，将在五月初运到重点治蝗区。    （新华社）
