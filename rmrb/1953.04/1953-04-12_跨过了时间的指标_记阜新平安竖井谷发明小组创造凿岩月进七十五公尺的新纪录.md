    Surpassing Time's Mark
    —Record of the Fuxin Ping'an Vertical Shaft Valley Invention Group Creating a New Record of 75 Meters Monthly Drilling Progress
    Chen Qi

    I.
    After twenty months of arduous labor and struggle, the Gu Invention Group finally completed the wellbore project of the Xi'an vertical shaft. This is the first pair of new vertical shafts opened in New China.
    After finishing the vertical shaft, the first thing that came to Gu Faming’s mind was to study, to go to a worker-peasant rapid course middle school. Gu Faming went to find Captain Ma with great excitement, and as soon as he saw the captain, he asked:
    "This time, should I go to study?"
    "That's right, this time we will let you go to Fuxin to study well."
    "Go to Fuxin?..." Gu Faming was taken aback, he knew that the rapid course middle school was not in Fuxin.
    "That's right, go to Fuxin to drill another pair of vertical shafts, and learn in practical work!"
    Gu Faming was really unwilling to hear these words, he wanted to explain the reason for requesting to study; but the captain did not wait for him to speak, and cordially told him the significance of this work. After he finished listening, he felt that his study was important, but building the motherland was even more important. Without saying anything else, he asked when to leave. The captain said: "You should settle your family first, and prepare before we talk about it!" Gu Faming said: "No need to prepare, I am always ready." The captain said: "Then let's leave tomorrow!"
    The next day, the train carrying Gu Faming and his companions left Xi'an.

    II.
    Gu Faming arrived in Fuxin, feeling indescribably happy. He gazed at this vast and beautiful plain, truly loving it.
    However, once at the vertical shaft construction site, the work here was not satisfactory. The rock loading machine shipped from the Soviet Union was discarded outside, and the 1.4 cubic meter large bucket was quietly搁置there,无人管无人问无人用(无人用 is repetitive so I have chosen to render it as) unattended. Workers were laboriously loading rocks with shovels, and the progress was as slow as an old ox.
    Seeing this situation, Gu Faming went to the squad leader:
    "Why don't we use the rock loading machine?"
    "It's not time to use the rock loading machine yet."
    "When will it be time?"
    "I can't make the decision on this, you wait for me to ask the higher-ups."
    The captain chatted with him for a few words, and then went busy with other things. Gu Faming waited for several days, and had to load rocks with shovels with his group of workers. The workers were used to using rock loading machines, and asking them to go back hundreds of years to do manual labor was more uncomfortable than being punished. After a few days, Gu Faming went to the captain again:
    "Are we going to use the rock loading machine or not?"
    "Yes, yes..."
    "When are we going to use it?"
    "The higher-ups will say when to use it."
    As he spoke, the captain explained the opinion of the management section, emphasized the objective difficulties, and said that other workers did not like to use it, fearing that they would not use it well and cause accidents. Gu Faming felt very unhappy when he heard this, and had to suppress his anger and explain to the captain, saying that this was an advanced Soviet tool, and it was wrong to let it sit idle. In the end, the captain said again: "I can't make the decision on this, I'll pass it on to the higher-ups for you." This passing on took several days again.
    The workers waved their shovels, fighting for time minute by minute, but time secretly slipped away in the captain's passing on. Finally, the rock loading machine was installed, but the large bucket was not installed. This was like buying a large spoon to eat, but the rice bowl was still a small wooden bowl, and half a spoon was full, unable to发挥 (fully exhibit/deploy) the effect of the rock loading machine. For this matter, Gu Faming went to the captain again to make suggestions, in the office, on the road, at large and small meetings, wherever the captain went, suggestions were made.
    The problem of the large bucket was not solved, and then there was the problem of oil. Gu Faming was drilling holes underground, using sticky No. 3 machine oil, and the rock drilling machine would stutter a couple of times and then stop. Gu Faming was anxious, ran to the surface to find the captain, and suggested using substitute oil before the good oil was transported. Gu Faming had used it in Xi'an and there was no problem. The captain said: "The higher-ups do not allow the use of substitute oil." Gu Faming saw that it would not work, and was about to take out money to buy it himself. The captain saw that he could not "checkmate" him, and had to call the electromechanical section to buy a few kilograms of substitute oil, and then sent Gu Faming away. Strangely enough, the substitute oil worked well and there were no accidents. From then on, there was a saying among the cadres: "The Gu Faming group is mischievous." "The Gu Faming group is difficult to lead, we can't manage them!" The captain溜了 (slipped away) far away when he saw Gu Faming, and the technicians did not dare to go to the Gu Faming group to inspect.
    At the Youth League representative meeting, everyone did not elect him as a model, saying that his "mass relations are not good"; when electing model party members, everyone did not elect him again, saying that he "does not obey leadership."
    Should he stick to his opinions? Or should he be agreeable with the captain? At this critical moment, Gu Faming thought of Xi'an, and thought of the Soviet expert. The shadow of expert Shi Mankuo appeared in his mind.

    III.
    As early as 1950, Xi'an began to修凿 (repair and excavate) the first pair of vertical shafts.
    At the beginning, the workers all took turns swinging sledgehammers to凿岩石 (drill rock). Soon, they switched to using rock drilling machines to 打眼 (drill holes). But the holes were drilled very shallow, at most only one meter deep.
    In February, Soviet expert Shi Mankuo came to Xi'an. Shi Mankuo was a broad-shouldered, large-sized man with a very loud voice, of worker origin, and treated Chinese workers like his own brothers.
    He understood all the technology of the wellhead, and although he did not say that he was an expert, the workers could all see it. He went down the well and inspected everything in the mud and water. He shook his head straight when he saw the workers loading rocks with shovels. He was very dissatisfied with the mechanical equipment in the well, and only when he saw the young and brave workers would he happily拍着大伙的肩膀 (pat everyone on the shoulder) and say good.
    After carefully inspecting the wellhead, Shi Mankuo suggested that the leadership use more machinery and打深眼 (drill deep holes), at least three meters deep. But many people opposed it, some said: "If you drill three meters deep, won't one explosion destroy the wellbore!" Some said: "Drill deep holes! How deep the wellbore is drilled, how many people will it take to fill it!" Some even bet their heads, saying that if drilling deep holes was successful, he would cut off his head.
    Regardless of the opposition from the "experts," the leadership still resolutely implemented the Soviet expert's suggestion, and decided to let the Gu Faming group start the experiment of drilling deep holes.
    The process of experimenting with drilling deep holes was difficult. Gu Faming had never done this kind of work before, and he was straight stunned when he first saw the two-meter-long drill bit, this drill bit was taller than a person, how could he reach it to drill holes! At the beginning, he moved a stool and stood on it to work, but the rock drilling machine was too powerful and震 (jolted/shook) him down from the stool. But he was still not discouraged, and used a safety belt to hang himself in the air, but he still could not do it well. Later, he accidentally used a short drill bit to drill a hole first, and then put the long drill bit in the original hole, so that the long drill bit was shortened a lot, and he could reach it to drill.
    Although the problem of the drill bit was solved, the rock was too hard and often夹住 (stuck) the drill bit, preventing it from being pulled out. Gu Faming also figured out a wire loop, which solved the problem of the drill bit being stuck. In the end, he did not go to the wellhead for four consecutive shifts, and did not even eat a meal day and night, and finally successfully tested the deep drilling.
    After the deep drilling was successful, the drilling speed continued to increase. This advanced the Xi'an vertical shaft project by five years and opened up a path for China's vertical shaft project.
    During the days of working in Xi'an and getting along with Soviet experts, Gu Faming understood that the main idea of the experts was to fully use machinery to build vertical shafts at the fastest speed. But the situation in Fuxin was exactly the opposite. With great enthusiasm, he wrote a long letter to the CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee, requesting the municipal committee to support him.

    IV.
    The facts exposed by Gu Faming to the municipal committee immediately aroused great attention from the municipal committee. Secretary Qi of the municipal committee personally talked to Gu Faming, and encouraged him not to be discouraged and to continue to adhere to the correct position. Just at this time, Soviet expert Qiqiwen came to Fuxin. After the expert inspected the wellhead, the conclusion he reached was also to strengthen the mechanization equipment, give full play to the mechanical potential, and propose a monthly goal of sixty meters. The CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee decided to strengthen the Party's leadership of the vertical shaft project, improve the Party's organization, and General Branch Secretary Ren Yiqin was派 (dispatched/sent) to the vertical shaft at this time.
    General Branch Secretary Ren Yiqin was an enthusiastic and沉着 (calm and composed) person. He knew the arduousness of his task well, and at the same time had the confidence to complete the task. As soon as he arrived at the wellhead, he started by adjusting the cadre relationship and opening up the cadres' thinking. Under the leadership of the general branch, criticism and self-criticism were widely展開 (unfolded/carried out), and the erroneous thoughts of the cadres in the middle who did not accept the advanced Soviet experience were exposed and criticized, and all were required to support the opinions of the Gu Faming group. The cadres at the level of captain changed their attitude one after another and检讨 (self-criticized) their mistakes. The large bucket proposed by Gu Faming was also試 (tried/tested) to be installed.
    Immediately afterwards, Soviet expert Pusiduoweiduo夫 (Pustovetov) came to Fuxin. On the basis of Qiqiwen's suggestion, he strengthened the mechanization equipment of the wellhead even more. One large bucket was not enough, and another one was added,实行 (implementing) double bucket lifting, and the rock extraction efficiency was doubled. In addition, he also proposed the advanced method of空中打壁座 (air hammering for the support base), which further shortened the non-production time. The leadership seized these conditions, held a mobilization meeting at the wellhead, put forward the goal of sixty meters per month, and called on the workers to strive to achieve the Soviet experts' suggestions.
    The speed of rock drilling is the key to determining the speed. At this time, everyone's eyes were focused on the Gu Faming group, to see if they could complete the task.
    Expert Pusiduoweiduo夫 (Pustovetov) personally went to the Gu Faming group to introduce them to the advanced Soviet drilling methods, and gave the drawings he brought to Gu Faming, wishing this young friend success.
    Gu Faming remembered the expert's words, and although he was not慌不忙 (panic-stricken) on the surface, he was secretly calculating in his heart. Although he did not understand mechanical efficiency, he calculated it with his own method. He calculated: a large bucket produces seventy buckets per meter, two hundred buckets per three meters, and excluding unexpected delays, there is no problem in achieving seventy meters per month.
    He studied this opinion with the workers of the group, and most people in the group said it would work. Gu Faming said: "If it works, let's订 (set) it in the plan, and challenge other groups." But a few older workers said: "It's better to set the plan a little less, it's more glorious if we exceed what we set, but if we can't reach what we set, then it's too ugly, I think we should set it in the middle." Gu Faming said: "Alright! You're already afraid of not being able to complete it before we even challenge. I say we are the working class, we can't hide our奸诈 (deceit/insidiousness) and we can't leave ourselves a way out, how much we can achieve, we will订 (set) how much, what do you all say?" This opinion was supported by everyone.
    The group plan was quickly passed. After the plan was passed, the first key issue was to do a good job in循环 (circulation/cycle). Vertical shaft construction does not have Sundays, and workers take turns休轮 (rotating rest). In the past, the group's labor organization was unreasonable, and there was no plan for rotating rest, sometimes people with high skills were all on vacation, leaving people with low skills to complete the task. Gu Faming discovered this loophole and re-arranged the group's labor force, with people with high skills resting at different times. And实行 (implemented) a three-package system - package drilling, package packaging, and package training, with high-skilled people leading low-skilled people,展开 (carrying out/launching) intra-group competitions, and initiating challenges to other groups, and the group's enthusiasm was like fire.
    The drilling efficiency was improved, but the rock loading group could not catch up, the rocks drilled by one shift could not be loaded by the second and third shifts, and the circulation was still not going well. Sometimes the rock loading group finished loading, but the electromechanical department delayed things. Accidents in the winch also affected the progress of the循环 (circulation/cycle). Gu Faming realized that to do a good job, it was necessary to unite the workers of other groups and do a good job in the overall circulation, which was the key to completing the task.
    Every day after work, he always stayed underground to wait for the workers of the second shift. As soon as the workers of the second shift came, he would shout: "Comrades of the second shift, you did a good job yesterday, you produced eighty buckets!" The second shift said: "It's all because you drilling is fast!" Gu Faming said: "We are all relying on you to eat, and you are the ones who are干的捞(干的捞 is difficult to directly translate as it seems to be a non-standard usage), today you've brought in a lot, can you eat it all?" The second shift said: "No problem, you just watch. Hey, this electric light is too dim, can you think of a way?" Gu Faming said: "Leave this to me, and listen to your new record tomorrow!" Then he went to find the captain, and the captain's attitude had indeed changed, and as soon as Gu Faming mentioned the electric light, he immediately went to find someone to install it.
    The electromechanical workshop did not have an accident for a week, and the Gu Faming group wrote a letter to congratulate them. The electromechanical workers felt really energetic when they saw it, and responded to them with even greater achievements.
    In early March, the wellhead was decorated with英雄牌 (Hero brand), honor roll, red flags, and red lanterns, with colorful new patterns every day, and every day,各小组的胜利捷报 (the victory news of each group) were reported. Gu Faming's name was decorated with big red flowers, becoming the center of everyone's vision.
    Time was advancing rapidly, and in the rock bottom three hundred meters deep underground, the Gu Faming group was racing against time: forty meters, fifty meters, and finally he surpassed the indicators of time,跨过(crossed/stepped over) sixty meters, and completed the new record of seventy-five meters of drilling.
    This record is amazing, greatly exceeding the level of capitalist countries. In the vertical shaft construction of New China, this is another brilliant spark, and this spark will turn into a fire sea in countless pairs of future vertical shaft projects.

    跨过了时间的指标
    ——记阜新平安竖井谷发明小组创造凿岩月进七十五公尺的新纪录
    陈旗
    一
    经过了二十个月的艰难的劳动和斗争，谷发明小组终于完成了西安竖井的井筒工程。这是新中国开凿的第一对新竖井。
    打完竖井，头一个来到谷发明心里的就是学习，上工农速成中学去学习。谷发明怀着极大的兴奋去找马队长，一见队长面就问：
    “这回该让我学习去了吧？”
    “对啦，这回要让你到阜新去好好学习一下子。”
    “到阜新去？……”谷发明心里一楞，他知道速成中学不在阜新。
    “对啦，到阜新去再打它一对竖井，在实际工作中学习去吧！”
    谷发明听了这句话，心里实在不乐意，他想说明要求学习的理由；但队长不等他说话，就亲热地给他讲这一工作的意义。他听完后，觉得自己学习重要，但建设祖国更重要。二话没说，就问什么时候起程。队长说：“你先安置一下家庭，准备准备再说吧！”谷发明说：“不用准备，我随时都准备好了。”队长说：“那明天就动身吧！”
    第二天列车载着谷发明和他的同伴们离开西安。二
    谷发明到了阜新，心里有一股说不出的高兴。他瞭望这一片广阔美丽的平原，心里着实喜爱。
    但是一到竖井工地，这里的工作却不能令人满意。由苏联运来的装岩机被弃置在外面，一点四立方公尺的大吊桶也静静搁着没有人管。而工人却在费劲地用铁锹装岩石，进度就像老牛一样，太慢了。
    谷发明一看这种情况，就去找分队长：
    “咱为啥不使装岩机？”
    “使装岩机还没到时候。”
    “多?才算到时候？”
    “这我也不能做主，你等我问一问上级。”
    队长和他唠了几句，就忙别的去了。谷发明一等就是好几天，只得和他小组工人们用铁锹装岩石。工人们使惯了装岩机，再要他们倒退几百年，用手工劳动比受刑罚都难受。过几天谷发明又去找队长：
    “咱们装岩机到底使不使”
    “使，使……”
    “多?使？”
    “上级说使就使。”
    说着，队长就把管理科的意见说了一遍，强调了一下客观困难，又说别的工人不爱使，害怕使不好出事故。谷发明一听，心里就好大不乐意，只得忍气和队长解释，说这是苏联先进工具，叫它窝工就犯错误。最后队长又说：“这事我不能做主，我给你向上级转达转达。”这一转达又是几天。
    工人们挥动着铁锹，在一分钟一分钟地争取着时间，但时间却在队长的转达中偷偷地滑过了。最后装岩机终于安上了，但大吊桶却没安上。这等于吃饭买了个大杓子，饭碗却仍是小木碗，半杓子就装满了，发挥不了装岩机的作用。为这事，谷发明又去找队长提意见，办公室里提，走在道上提，大会小会上提，队长到了哪里，意见就提到哪里。
    大吊桶的问题没有解决，又出了个油的问题。谷发明在井下打眼，使用发黏的三号机器油，凿岩机突突转两下就不转了。谷发明急了，跑到井上找队长，建议在好油没有运来之前，先使代用油。谷发明在西安时曾用过，没有问题。队长说：“上级不准使代用油。”谷发明一看不行，就要掏钱自己去买。队长一看“将”不过他，只得打电话找机电科，现买了几斤代用油，才把谷发明打发走了。说也奇怪，代用油挺好使，一点没出事故。从这以后，干部中间都传说着这样一种话：“谷发明小组调皮捣蛋。”“谷发明小组难领导，咱们管不了！”队长看见谷发明就远远溜了，技术员也不敢上谷发明小组去检查。
    开青年团代表会，大伙不选他当模范，说他“群众关系不好”；选举模范党员，大伙又没选他，说他“不服从领导”。
    还是坚持意见呢？还是随和队长呢？在这关头，谷发明想起了西安，想起了苏联专家。专家石曼阔的影子在他脑海里浮现出来了。三
    远在一九五○年，西安就开始修凿第一对竖井。
    开始时，工人们都轮大锤凿岩石。不久，改用了凿岩机打眼。但眼打得很浅，最多只有一公尺深。
    二月间，苏联专家石曼阔来到了西安。石曼阔是
    一个宽肩大个儿嗓音很宏亮的人，工人出身，对中国工人就像亲兄弟一样。
    他懂得井口一切技术，虽然他不说自己是内行，但工人们都能看得出来。他一下井，泥里水里都察看。他看工人用铁锹装岩石，急得直摇脑袋。他对井里的机械设备很不满意，唯有看见年青勇敢的工人们时，他才高兴地拍着大伙的肩膀说好。
    石曼阔详细察看井口后，就建议领导上多使用机械，打深眼，最少要三公尺深。但是有很多人反对，有的说：“打三公尺深的眼，一崩还不把井筒崩坏啊！”有的说：“深打眼！井筒打多深，拿多少人来填吧！”有的还拿脑袋打赌，说深打眼成功了，他把脑袋割下来。
    不管“内行”人反对，领导上还是坚决要执行苏联专家建议，决定由谷发明小组开头试验深打眼。
    试验深打眼的过程是艰难的。谷发明早先没干过这路活，头一眼看见二公尺长的钎子，直发楞，这钎子比人还高，打眼哪够得着！一开头他搬凳子站着干，凿岩机力气大，把他从凳子上震了下来。但他还是不灰心，又用安全带把自己吊在空中，还是干不好。后来他偶然用短钎子先打一个眼，然后再把长钎子放在原眼里，这样长钎子就缩短了不少，自己也能够着打了。
    钎子问题虽然解决了，但岩石太硬，常常夹住钎子拔不出来。谷发明又捉摸出铁丝圈，解决了夹钎子的问题。最后他一连四个班没上井口，一天一宵连饭都没吃，终于把深打眼试验成功了。
    深打眼成功后，打眼速度不断提高。使西安竖井工程跃进了五年，并给我国竖井工程开辟了道路。
    在西安工作时和苏联专家相处的日子里，谷发明领会了专家主要的思想就是充分运用机械，以最快的速度建设竖井。而阜新的情况，却恰恰不是这样。他怀着满腔的热诚，给中共阜新市委会写了一封长信，请求市委支持他。四
    谷发明向市委揭发的事实，立刻引起了市委会极大的注意。市委齐秘书亲自找谷发明谈话，并鼓励他不要泄气，继续坚持正确的立场。恰在这时候，苏联专家奇奇文来到阜新，专家视察井口以后，所得结论也是加强机械化设备，充分发挥机械潜力，并提出月进六十公尺的目标。中共阜新市委会决定加强竖井工程的党的领导，健全党的组织，总支书记任义钦就在这时被派到了竖井。
    总支书记任义钦是个热情沉着的人，他深知自己任务的艰巨，同时也有完成任务的信心。他一到井口，就从调整干部关系，打通干部思想着手。在总支的领导下，广泛展开了批评与自我批评，揭发批判了干部中间不接受苏联先进经验等错误思想，要求全力支持谷发明小组意见。队长一级的干部纷纷转变了态度，检讨了自己的错误。谷发明所提的大吊桶，也试着安上了。
    紧接着，苏联专家普斯多维多夫又来到阜新，他在奇奇文建议的基础上，又加强了井口机械化的设备，大吊桶一个还不够，又添了一个，实行双吊桶提升，出岩效率快了一倍。另外他还提出空中打壁座的先进方法，进一步缩短了非生产时间。领导上抓住这些条件，在井口召开了动员大会，提出月进六十公尺的目标，号召工人们为实现苏联专家建议而奋斗。
    凿岩快慢是决定速度的关键。这时，大伙的眼睛都注视着谷发明小组，看他们能不能完成任务。
    专家普斯多维多夫亲自到谷发明小组里，给他们介绍苏联先进打眼方法，并把自己带来的图纸送给谷发明，预祝这年青朋友成功。
    谷发明记住了专家的话，表面上不慌不忙，心里却偷偷算计着。他虽然不懂机械效率，但他用自己的法子算了出来。他算计：大吊桶出七十桶进一公尺，出二百桶进三公尺，除去意外的耽误，月进七十公尺没有问题。
    他把这个意见和小组的工人们研究，小组里大多数人都说行。谷发明说：“要行，咱就订在计划里，和别的小组挑战。”但有几个年岁大一些的工人却说：“订计划还是少订一些吧，订的少咱超过了更光荣，订的多要达不到，那就太难看啦，我看咱就订个当腰数吧。”谷发明说：“得啦！还没挑战呢，你就先怕完不成。我说咱是工人阶级，咱就不能藏奸，不能留后手，能达到多少，咱就订多少，你们大伙说怎么样？”这个意见得到了大家的支持。
    小组计划很快地就通过了。计划通过后，第一个关键问题就是搞好循环。竖井建设没有星期日，工人休息采取轮流休息制。过去小组的劳动组织不合理，轮休也没有计划，有时技术高的人都休假了，留下技术低的完不成任务。谷发明发现这个漏洞，重新编排小组劳动力，技术高的人插开休息。并实行三包制——包打、包装、包练，技术高的带动技术低的，展开组内比赛，发起向别组挑战，小组劲头就像火一样起来了。
    凿岩效率提高了，但装岩小组赶不上，一班凿的岩石，二三班装不上，循环还是搞不好。有时装岩组装好，但机电上耽误事。绞车发生事故，也影响循环的进行。谷发明认识到要搞好工作，必须团结别组工人，共同搞好大循环，这是完成任务的关键。
    每天一下班，他总留在井下等候二班工人。二班工人一来，他就喊着说：“二班同志们，昨天你们干的不错啊，出了八十桶啊！”二班说：“都是你们凿岩干的快啊！”谷发明说：“我们这一帮都是吃水饭的，捞干的还是你们啊，今儿个进的可不少，你们能吃的了吗？”二班说：“没问题，你就瞧着吧。哎，这电灯太暗啦，你给想个办法吧！”谷发明说：“这点事包在我身上，明天听你们的新纪录啊！”接着他就去找队长，队长态度的确转变了，谷发明一提电灯，他就马上去找人安上了。
    机电车间一礼拜没出事故，谷发明小组就写信祝贺他们。机电工人一看真来劲，就用更大的成绩来回答他们。
    三月初，井口上英雄牌、光荣榜、红旗、红灯，五彩缤纷，每天都在变新花样，每天都在报告着各小组的胜利捷报。谷发明的名字用大红花装饰起来，成了大伙视线的中心。
    时间飞速前进着，在地下三百公尺深的岩石底层，谷发明小组在与时间赛跑：四十公尺，五十公尺，最后他超过了时间的指标，跨过了六十公尺，完成了凿岩七十五公尺的新纪录。
    这纪录是惊人的，大大超过了资本主义国家的水平。在新中国的竖井建设上，这又是一个灿烂的火花，这火花将在未来无数对竖井工程中变成火海。
