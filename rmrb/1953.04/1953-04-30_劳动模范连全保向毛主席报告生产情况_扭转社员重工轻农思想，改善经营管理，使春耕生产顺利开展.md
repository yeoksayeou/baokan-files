Respected Chairman Mao:

After studying the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Spring Ploughing Production" published in the People's Daily, we have further clarified the important significance of striving for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1953 for the country's large-scale economic construction. We understand that doing a good job in spring planting is the fundamental key to ensuring a bumper harvest. Therefore, we quickly rectified the organization and system of the agricultural production cooperative, and tried our best to fully utilize all the strength of the entire cooperative for spring planting production. As of early April, we have completed the following tasks.

Our cooperative has 410 mu of autumn land, which has been harrowed once before Qingming Festival. In order to preserve moisture and resist drought, we also harrowed 80 mu of wheat land once. Following this, we started hoeing the wheat fields and applying topdressing fertilizer, ensuring a bumper wheat harvest. We also thoroughly cleaned and inspected the fertilizer situation of the entire cooperative. In addition to the existing manure from pigs, sheep, cattle, and donkeys, there are more than 14,000 dan of smoked fertilizer. In total, there is an average of 144 dan of base fertilizer per mu of land. All of these fertilizers have been delivered to the fields. According to the needs of this year's production, we added and repaired more than 60 pieces of farm tools and furniture. After completing these tasks, we began plowing the land, having plowed 250 mu, ensuring that it was deep first and then shallow. In addition, we improved 30 mu of soil. All seeds have been dried and germination tested. After the heavy snowfall in mid-March, we mobilized male and female cooperative members to accumulate a large amount of snow, which can store 1,800 dan of water. Together with the 1,700 dan of water stored from last winter's accumulated snow, we can sow 158 mu of corn land, ensuring full seedlings and full ridges. We have also made preparations for insect prevention and control.

In order to build the mountainous areas and supply the timber needed for national construction, we carried out spring afforestation work. We planted a total of 1,350 saplings of timber trees such as poplar, willow, elm, and locust, 1,150 walnut trees, and 1,115 peach and apricot trees; and cultivated a nursery of 1.5 mu and an orchard of 1 mu. We plan to gradually green the entire village.

The reason why our spring planting preparation work has been able to proceed smoothly is mainly because we carried out criticism and self-criticism in the work of rectifying the organization and improving the management of the cooperative, and conducted education on the consistency between national industrialization and the interests of farmers. Originally, a few cadres in our cooperative had developed the erroneous idea that "there is no future in engaging in agriculture." For example, the labor team leader, Yuan Jüzhou, believed that engaging in agriculture was not as good as working in a factory, thinking that it was better to eat and earn more money in the factory. Therefore, he was passive and slack in agricultural production, which affected the labor mood of the entire team. Under his influence, Guo Xiaotao and other six young people did not want to work and wanted to work in factories. After we carried out education on the relationship between industrial construction and agricultural production, and let everyone see the glorious future of farmers, this ideological problem was solved. Next, we proceeded to re-elect the cadres in the cooperative and implement the responsibility system of contracting work and output. The labor enthusiasm of all cooperative members has generally risen. Spring planting production competitions have been launched among the various labor teams. The atmosphere in the cooperative is completely new. At the same time as solving the above problems, we also stopped general sideline production in a timely manner, withdrew four full laborers who were opening felt tents, appropriately reduced the number of workers in the flour mill, and used most of the cooperative's labor force in agricultural production, ensuring the smooth progress of spring planting production.

The above situation is reported to you and greetings are extended!

Lian Quanbao, Head of the Yuanzhuang Village Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in the Seventh District of Lingchuan County, Shanxi (written by Yang Zhenfu)

    劳动模范连全保向毛主席报告生产情况
    扭转社员重工轻农思想，改善经营管理，使春耕生产顺利开展敬爱的毛主席：
    我们学习了人民日报上发表的中共中央“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”以后，进一步明确了争取一九五三年农业丰收对国家进行大规模经济建设的重要意义。我们知道了作好春耕下种工作，就是保证丰收的基本关键。因此，我们赶紧整顿了农业生产合作社的机构和制度，尽可能地把全社所有的一切力量完全运用到春耕生产上去。截至四月初旬，我们已作好了下列工作。
    我社秋地四百一十亩，在清明节前已全部耙过了一次。为了保墒耐旱，我们还把八十亩小麦地全部耙了一遍，接着，我们就开始了锄麦地、上追肥等工作，保证小麦丰收。我们又彻底清理和检查了全社肥料的情况。除已有的猪、羊、牛、驴等厩肥以外，还有熏肥一万四千多担。总计平均每亩地已有了一百四十四担底肥。所有这些肥料都已送到地里。根据今年生产的需要，我们添置和修理了农具家具共六十多件。完成这些工作后，即开始耕地，已耕好二百五十亩，做到先深后浅。此外，并改良了土壤三十亩。种子都经过了翻晒和发芽试验。在三月中旬降大雪后，我们曾发动男女社员大量积雪，计可蓄水一千八百担，再加上去冬积雪蓄水一千七百担，共可点种一百五十八亩玉茭地，保证全苗满垅。在防虫治虫方面，我们也作好了准备工作。
    为了建设山区和供给祖国建设所需要的木材，我们进行了春季植树造林工作。共栽了杨、柳、榆、槐等木料树一千三百五十棵，核桃树一千一百五十棵，桃、杏树一千一百一十五棵；并养了苗圃
    一亩半，水果园一亩。我们准备逐步做到绿化全村。
    我们春耕准备工作所以能够顺利进行，主要原因是我们在整顿社的组织机构和改进经营管理的工作中，开展了批评和自我批评，进行了祖国工业化与农民利益一致性的教育。原来我们有少数社内干部曾发生了“搞农业没前途”的错误思想。如劳动小组长原聚周认为搞农业不如进工厂，以为在工厂里吃的好，挣钱多，因而对农业生产消极怠工，影响了整个小组组员的劳动情绪。郭小桃等六个青年在他的影响下也都不想劳动，想到工厂去做工。经过我们进行了工业建设与农业生产的相互关系的教育，让大家看到了农民的光荣前途，才解决了这个思想问题。接着，我们就进行改选社内干部和实行包工包产的责任制，全体社员的劳动积极性已普遍高涨起来。各劳动小组之间开展了春耕生产竞赛。社内气象一新。在和解决上述问题同时，我们又适时地停止了一般的副业生产，把开毡房的四个全劳力抽回，适当地减少了粉房工人，把全社绝大部分劳力用在农业生产方面，保证了春耕生产的顺利进行。
    以上情况谨向您报告，并致敬礼！山西陵川县七区原庄村农林畜牧生产合作
    社社长连全保（代笔人杨振富）
