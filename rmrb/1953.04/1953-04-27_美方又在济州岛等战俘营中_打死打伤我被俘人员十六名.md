Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 26th: The U.S. side again beat to death and wounded sixteen of our captured personnel in prisoner-of-war camps on Jeju Island and Geoje Island. According to the U.S. announcement, on April 24th, in the prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island detaining captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who the U.S. side insisted were refusing repatriation, fifteen prisoners of war were whipped and injured, three of whom died. The U.S. communique revealed that these people were so-called "agitators" who were searched. This proves that although these prisoners of war were insisted to be "refusing repatriation," they were actually resolutely demanding repatriation.

On April 21st, another prisoner of war was beaten to death in a prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island.

    美方又在济州岛等战俘营中
    打死打伤我被俘人员十六名
    【新华社开城二十六日电】美方又在济州岛和巨济岛战俘营中打死打伤我方被俘人员十六名。据美方宣布，在济州岛上拘留被美方硬说是拒绝遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的战俘营中，四月二十四日有十五名战俘被鞭打成伤，其中有三名死亡。美方公报中透露，这些人是被搜查的所谓“鼓动分子”。这就证明，虽然这些战俘被硬说成是“拒绝遣返”的战俘，但是实际上他们却是坚决要求遣返的。
    四月二十一日，在巨济岛战俘营中又有一名战俘被打死。
