Preliminary Investigation of Grain Situation in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province
Hua Dong Grain Bureau

Last December, the East China Grain Bureau sent an investigation team to Laiyang Prefecture, a major grain-producing area in Shandong Province, to investigate the production and purchase of grain. The following is an excerpt of some of the materials they obtained from the investigation.

Grain Production in Grain-Producing Areas Exceeds Pre-War Levels

According to calculations by the Laiyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Finance and Economics, grain production in Laiyang Prefecture in 1952 increased by more than 300 million catties compared to 1951. Taking Zhongcun Township in Huang County of the prefecture as an example, the average yield per mu of various grains (including wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum, millet, and glutinous millet, etc.) was: 338 catties in 1936; 307 catties in 1950; 317 catties in 1951; and 387 catties in 1952, an increase of 14.7 percent over pre-war levels. The main grain yields in the township are as follows: The average yield of wheat per mu was 209 catties in 1936, 248 catties in 1951, and 300 catties in 1952, an increase of 43.5 percent over pre-war levels; the average yield of corn per mu was 524 catties in 1936, 527 catties in 1951, and 720 catties in 1952, an increase of 37.4 percent over pre-war levels.

One of the important reasons for the increase in grain production is that farmers have increased investment in production. The number of water wells in Beicun Village, Zhongcun Township, Huang County, increased from only 40 before the war to 159 in 1952; the village had 11 donkeys in 1936, increasing to 25 in 1952; and the amount of fertilizer applied in the village in 1952 increased by 40 percent compared to 1951.

Industrial Raw Materials and Sideline Production are also Developing

Due to the high prices and profits of industrial raw materials, farmers in grain-producing areas are also happy to grow cash crops. In Liuyizhuang, Laiyang County, 50 households with a total of 678 mu of land, in addition to growing grain, planted 20 mu of flax in 1951 and 40 mu in 1952. The average yield of flax per mu is nine ma (one weighing 12 catties), which can be sold for 720,000 yuan; while the average yield of corn per mu is 350 catties, worth only 235,000 yuan. Although flax is harvested three times in two years, and cornfields can be harvested twice a year if the water conservancy is good, the cost of agricultural inputs is similar, so growing flax is more profitable. Local farmers reflected: "Those who don't grow flax are at a disadvantage." It seems that the area planted with flax may expand.

Pig raising has become an important sideline occupation for farmers. There are 111,700 pigs raised in 110,000 households in Laiyang County. There were 191 pigs raised in 514 households in Gucheng Township, Laiyang, which increased to 517 in 1952.

Industrial raw materials and sideline products account for a large proportion of the income of farmers in grain-producing areas. The Sun Huanchang family in Liuyizhuang, Laiyang County, has 12.3 mu of land and a total income of 6,190 catties of grain for the whole year, while the total income from industrial raw materials, vegetable gardens, and sideline products is equivalent to 3,926 catties of grain. The Liu Jinshan family has 17.5 mu of land and a total grain harvest of 8,171 catties for the whole year, and other sideline income is equivalent to 2,406 catties of grain. Most of the production materials and living materials needed by farmers, except for grain, are exchanged for sideline income as much as possible.

Farmers' Grain Consumption Has Increased

With the development of production, farmers' living standards have significantly improved, and grain consumption has greatly increased compared to the past. Households that used to eat sweet potatoes as their staple food now mostly eat grain, and sweet potatoes are mostly sold or used as feed. The Sun Huanchang family in Liuyizhuang, Laiyang County, had difficulty eating sweet potatoes in 1949 and had to eat wild vegetables. In 1951, they mainly ate grain, and most of the 1,500 catties of sweet potatoes they harvested were used as feed. In 1952, they ate only grain and consumed 35 catties of pork before the Spring Festival.

The average living standard of middle peasants in Liuyizhuang is 380 catties of coarse and fine grains per person per year. The amount of grain consumed by livestock is also considerable. A donkey needs an average of 360 catties of grain per year, and a pig needs an average of 300 catties of grain per year. Huang County even exceeds this number. It is estimated that the amount of grain consumed by livestock will increase further with the large increase in livestock.

There is Still Surplus Grain in Rural Areas

Farmers' living standards have improved, and grain consumption has generally increased, but there is still a lot of surplus grain. It is estimated that the 50 households in Liuyizhuang, Laiyang County, will have more than 20,000 catties of surplus grain by the time the wheat ripens this year. About seven or eight households can have a surplus of about 1,000 catties of grain, about 20 households can have a surplus of about 500 catties of grain, about 10 households can have a surplus of about 200-300 catties of grain, about 10 households have just enough to eat, and there are not many households short of grain.

Among the 836 households in Zhongcun Township, Huang County, about 500 households can have a surplus of about 1,000 catties of grain when the wheat ripens, about 20 households can have a surplus of about 3,000 catties, about 15 households can have a surplus of about 2,000 catties, about 10 households have just enough to eat and have no surplus, and the remaining households mostly have a surplus of 300-500 catties.

Many Farmers are Unwilling to Sell Grain

There is a lot of surplus grain in rural areas, but the amount of commodity grain that farmers sell to the state or cooperatives, or take to the market to sell, is not more than in previous years. The amount of grain purchased by state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in grain-producing areas is very low. For example, autumn grain production in the grain-producing area of Huang County in 1952 increased by nearly one-third compared to 1951, while the number of purchases in December 1952 decreased by 37 percent compared to the same period in 1951. Farmers are unwilling to sell surplus grain for the following reasons:

1. Farmers generally have plans to store grain for famine relief. Grain is the most precious treasure, which is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in rural areas. Many farmers said: "We have eaten sweet potatoes and wild vegetables for so many years, and we have had enough of hard times. We have finally harvested so much grain, so let's keep it! We don't know whether the coming year will be good or bad, so we are not sure!"

2. Urban and rural material exchanges are active, local products and specialties have opened up sales channels, industrial raw materials are selling well, and rural sideline industries are developed. Farmers can rely on the income from selling local products, specialties, industrial raw materials, and sideline products to exchange for most of their living and production materials; their savings capacity has also increased, so they rarely sell or even need to sell surplus grain.

3. In the past, industrial raw materials in the area were "purchased" by state-owned commercial enterprises or cooperatives without seasonal price differences, while the seasonal price differences for grain in the market were very large. Farmers reflected that industrial raw materials are controlled by the government, and the prices are also fixed. There will be losses if we keep them, and the government is calling on us to sell them, so of course we sell industrial raw materials first; grain can be eaten if we keep it, and we can sell it for a good price in the future. We don't need money urgently, so of course we don't sell grain. There are also problems with the price ratio between industrial products and grain, and the price ratio between industrial raw materials and grain; the low price of grain is also the reason why farmers are reluctant to sell.

4. Many farmers use grain to buy land and put it out at usurious interest rates. In Zhongcun Township, Huang County, from the time the land reform was completed and land certificates were issued in May 1951 to the end of 1952, there were 108 cases of buying and selling and exchanging land. Among them, more than 20 households bought land, 13 households sold land, and the rest were all exchanges, exchanging inferior land for good land, and distant land for nearby land. With the development of land trading relations, land prices have increased accordingly. In 1952, local land prices generally increased by more than five times compared to 1949. Now the price of each mu of land in the village is at least 600 catties of grain, the highest is 1,400 catties of grain, and the price of medium-grade land is 1,000 catties of grain.

The situation of high interest rates is serious: Sun Jianpin, a poor peasant in Beicun Village, Zhongcun Township, borrowed one dou of corn in the spring and repaid one and a half dou in the summer (after three months); Sun Fengying, a middle peasant, lent out 1,800 catties of grain, and the interest alone was more than 1,000 catties of grain after one year. The lowest monthly interest rate in the village is also 20 percent. Sun Quanxiu, a middle peasant, has borrowed about 2,000 catties of grain over the years and has been downgraded to a poor peasant. Among the 81 households in Beicun Village, Zhongcun Township, more than 30 households have had grain borrowing and lending relations in the past two years, of which seven poor peasant households borrowed a total of 3,240 catties of grain due to difficulties in life; 14 middle peasant households borrowed a total of more than 6,000 catties of grain for purchasing land or expanding agricultural production investment; and 11 middle peasant households lent out 6,000 catties of grain.

The above are the main reasons why farmers are unwilling to sell grain. Therefore, how to educate farmers to sell surplus grain to develop agricultural production, how to take correct economic measures, formulate correct price policies and ensure their implementation, so that farmers sell surplus grain to the state to support the country's economic construction, are issues that deserve full attention and resolution.

    山东省莱阳专区粮食情况初步调查
    华东粮食局
    去年十二月，华东粮食局派遣调查小组，到山东省主要产粮区莱阳专区调查粮食的生产和收购情形。现将他们调查所得的一些材料摘录如下。
    产粮区粮食生产超过战前水平
    据莱阳专署财经委员会计算，莱阳专区的粮食，一九五二年较一九五一年增产三亿斤以上。以该专区黄县中村乡为例，各种粮食（包括小麦、玉米、大豆、高粱、谷子、黍子等）每亩平均产量是：一九三六年三百三十八斤；一九五○年三百零七斤；一九五一年三百一十七斤；一九五二年三百八十七斤，比战前提高百分之十四点七。该乡主要粮食产量如下：小麦每亩地的平均产量，一九三六年是二百零九斤，一九五一年是二百四十八斤，一九五二年为三百斤，比战前提高百分之四十三点五；玉米每亩平均产量一九三六年是五百二十四斤，一九五一年是五百二十七斤，一九五二年是七百二十斤，比战前提高了百分之三十七点四。
    粮食增产的重要原因之一是农民增加了生产的投资。黄县中村乡北村的水井战前仅有四十眼，到一九五二年增至一百五十九眼；该村在一九三六年有驴十一头，一九五二年增至二十五头；该村施肥量一九五二年比一九五一年增加了百分之四十。
        工业原料和副业生产也在发展
    由于工业原料价高利厚，产粮区的农民也乐于种植经济作物。莱阳县留衣庄五十户人家，共六百七十八亩地，除种粮食外，一九五一年有二十亩地种了线麻，一九五二年有四十亩地种了线麻。每亩地种线麻平均收九个麻（一个重十二斤），能卖七十二万元；而每亩地种玉米平均收三百五十斤，仅值二十三万五千元。虽然种麻是二年收三次，玉米地在水利好的情况下可以一年收两次，但农本相差无几，还是种麻利大。当地农民反映：“不种麻的人就是吃亏”。看来线麻种植面积还可能扩大。
    养猪已成为农民的重要副业。莱阳全县十一万户，共养了十一万一千七百头猪。莱阳古城乡有五百一十四户，一九四九年养了一百九十一头猪，一九五二年增至五百一十七头。
    产粮区农民收入的来源，工业原料和副业产品占很大的比重。莱阳县留衣庄农民孙焕昌家有田十二点三亩，全年收入粮食六千一百九十斤，而工业原料、菜园和副业产品的全年收入折粮三千九百二十六斤。农民刘进山家有田十七点五亩，全年收粮八千一百七十一斤，其他副业收入折粮二千四百零六斤。农民所需要的生产资料和生活资料，除粮食外，大多尽量以副产收入来换取。
    农民的粮食消费量增大了
    随着生产的发展，农民生活显著地提高了，粮食的消费量比从前大大增加了。过去以红薯当主食品的农户，现在大都吃粮食了，红薯多被卖出或用作饲料。莱阳县留衣庄农民孙焕昌家，一九四九年吃红薯都困难，还得吃野菜。一九五一年主要吃粮食，收了一千五百斤红薯大都作了饲料。一九五二年尽吃粮食，不到春节还食用了三十五斤猪肉。
    留衣庄的中农生活水平，大小口平均每人每年吃粗细粮三百八十斤。牲畜消费粮食的数量也是相当大的，一头驴每年平均需粮三百六十斤，一头猪每年平均需粮三百斤。黄县还超过此数。估计今后牲畜消费粮食的数量将随牲畜大量增殖而更形增加。
    农村里还有剩余粮食
    农民的生活水平提高，粮食的消费量普遍增大了，但剩余的粮食还是不少。莱阳县留衣庄有五十户人家，估计到今年麦熟时还多余粮食二万斤左右。其中约有七、八户可余粮一千斤左右，约有二十户可余粮五百斤左右，约有十户可余粮二、三百斤，仅够食用的约有十户，缺粮户不多。
    黄县中村乡八百三十六户中，到麦熟还能剩余一千斤左右粮食的约有五百户，能剩余三千斤左右的约有二十户，能剩余二千斤左右的约有十五户，仅够吃用而无剩余的约十户左右，其余户大都剩余三、五百斤。
    许多农民不愿意出卖粮食
    农村中剩余的粮食是不少的，但农民卖给国家或合作社的粮食，或拿到市场上去出卖的商品粮并不比往年多。国营粮食部门和合作社在产粮区的粮食收购量很低。例如黄县产粮区一九五二年秋粮较一九五一年增产近三分之一，而一九五二年十二月的收购数反比一九五一年同期减少了百分之三十七。农民不愿意出售剩余粮食，有如下几个原因：
    一、农民普遍地有储粮备荒的打算。粮食是宝中之宝，这在农村是深入人心的。许多农民表示：“过去多少年来都吃红薯、野菜，苦日子过够了，好容易收到这么些粮食，还是留着吧！来年的年景是好是坏还不知道，拿不稳呢！”
    二、城乡物资交流活跃，土产特产打开了销路，工业原料更是畅销，农村副业发达，农民依靠出卖土产、特产、工业原料和副业产品的收入即能换取大部分的生活资料与生产资料；他们的储蓄能力也增加了，因而很少出卖甚至不需要出卖剩余粮食。
    三、当地过去的工业原料由国营商业或合作社
    “包收”，没有季节差价，而市场上的粮食季节差价则是很大的。农民反映说：工业原料是政府掌握的，价钱也是不变的，留着还有损耗，政府又号召我们卖，当然先卖工业原料；粮食留着又能吃，将来要卖也可以卖好价钱，我们不急用钱，当然不卖粮食。工业品和粮食的比价，工业原料和粮食的比价也有问题；粮价偏低，也是农民惜售的原因。
    四、不少农民用粮食买田置地，放高利贷。黄县中村乡从一九五一年五月土地改革结束颁发土地证时起，到一九五二年年底止，买卖和倒换田地的事共发生一百零八件。其中买田的有二十余户，卖田的十三户，其余都是倒换，次换好，远换近。由于土地买卖关系的发展，地价随之提高了。一九五二年当地地价一般较一九四九年提高了五倍以上。现在该村每亩地的价格最低是六百斤谷，最高的是一千四百斤谷，中等地一千斤谷。
    高利贷的情形是严重的：中村乡北村贫农孙建品春借玉米一斗，夏还斗半（经过三个月）；中农孙凤英贷出谷子一千八百斤，过了一年光利息就有一千多斤粮食。该村月利最低者也是百分之二十。中农孙全修连年借入粮食约二千斤，已下降为贫农。中村乡北村有八十一户人家，两年来共有三十多户发生粮谷借贷关系，其中有七户贫农因生活困难，共借了三千二百四十斤粮食；有十四户中农因购置土地或扩大农业生产投资，共借了六千多斤粮食，有十一户中农贷出了六千斤粮食。
    以上就是农民不愿意出售粮食的几个主要原因。因此，如何教育农民出售剩余粮食以发展农业生产，如何采取正确的经济措施，制订正确的价格政策并保证执行，使农民把余粮卖给国家，以支持国家的经济建设，是值得充分注意解决的问题。
