With the development of China's economic construction, many women across the country have actively participated in industrial production. Their achievements in production work have pointed out a broad future for women's participation in national industrial construction.

The textile industry, where women workers account for more than 60%, is one of China's largest industries. Taking the highest annual output before liberation as 100, the output of cotton yarn in 1952 reached 151.1, and the output of cotton cloth reached 164.8. This shows that the production efficiency of female textile workers has significantly improved. For example, the average loom tending capacity of female workers in state-owned cotton mills was 2 to 4 ordinary looms or 12 to 16 automatic looms in 1949, but by 1952 it had increased to 6 to 8 ordinary looms or 24 to 32 automatic looms. The spindle tending capacity of female workers has also greatly improved. In 1949, each person could tend an average of 300 to 400 spindles, which increased to 600 to 800 spindles in 1952. Some outstanding female workers, such as Ning Shuzhen and Ma Shufang from Tianjin Cotton Mill No. 5, tended to as many as 1,100 spindles or more.

Work that women had never participated in throughout Chinese history is now being done by women. Among the female workers in Dalian and Lushun, many have mastered industrial techniques such as using lathes, repairing ships, or sand casting. Wu Yuanyu, the furnace chief of a blast furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, works alongside male workers. Female train attendant teams and female dispatchers have appeared on the railways. Now, women can be seen skillfully engaged in production next to steel furnaces, in machine shops, foundries, electrical rooms, laboratories, docks, and in front of automatic textile machines. Only a few years ago, these people were students or housewives, but New China has cultivated them into new-type people.

Women have created many advanced working methods in production. The famous Hao Jianxiu working method has emerged in the textile industry. The promotion of this working method has saved a lot of wealth for the country. Jing Shuzhen, a female worker at Songjiang Province Rubber Factory No. 1, created the non-stop doffing method, which can create a value equivalent to 17,442 tons of grain for the country in one year per machine. Wang Lianfen, a female worker at Northeast Machinery Factory No. 9, used the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method to find a trick for using six tools to turn arc washers, increasing production efficiency by seven times. Many female labor models and advanced workers have emerged in various places. According to statistics, female labor models in industry alone account for more than 12% of the total number of industrial labor models in the country. Many outstanding female workers have been promoted to administrative or technical cadres in factories. Some hold positions such as managers, factory directors, and workshop directors. In the transportation sector, many female workers have taken on positions such as station masters, passenger transport directors, passenger train captains, and transport captains.

Due to participating in national construction work and actively engaging in production, women's political status has greatly improved. Many female workers have been elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels and as government committee members, managing state affairs. The living and welfare benefits of female workers have also been significantly improved. The principle of equal pay for equal work between men and women has been implemented in factories across the country. Regulations on paying wages to female workers during maternity leave have been implemented in larger factories. Factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places regularly conduct pre-natal and post-natal physical examinations for female workers, hold maternal and child health lectures, and establish nurseries and maternal and child health stations to ensure that they can engage in production with peace of mind. Tens of thousands of female workers have moved into newly built workers' dormitories, and some female labor models are recuperating in specially designated sanatoriums in Qingdao, West Lake, and other places. Female workers in various places have also participated in spare-time studies and specialized technical studies, and many have been elected as study models. (Xinhua News Agency)

Xinhua News Agency -- The broad masses of rural women have played a huge role in the restoration and development of agricultural production nationwide by participating in the agricultural production movement.

Women participating in agricultural production nationwide account for approximately 60% of the total rural female labor force. In some areas, this reaches 80% or 90%. In the patriotic production increase movement, a considerable number of rural women participated in major agricultural labor. One of the characteristics of agricultural production in the last two years is the large-scale participation of rural working women in various forms of labor mutual aid organizations. In 1952, women participating in various labor mutual aid organizations accounted for more than 30% of the rural female labor force nationwide. Due to the joint active production of male and female farmers participating in agricultural production, the national agricultural production volume has increased year by year. In addition to participating in field labor such as spring planting, autumn harvesting, and fertilizer accumulation, the broad masses of rural women have also learned techniques such as seed selection, seed disinfection, and pest control. Last year, more than 280,000 women in Anhui Province participated in pest control work, saving more than 375,000 mu of seedlings. Women are very active in learning new production knowledge and technology. Many women have participated in agricultural technology training stations to learn advanced agricultural experience and agricultural production knowledge and technology, and a small number of women have learned to use new-style agricultural tools. According to statistics from 32 counties in Hebei Province last year, 120,000 women participated in technical training stations. According to statistics from 13 counties in Songjiang Province, more than 270 people have learned to use horse-drawn farm implements, weeding machines, and shoveling machines.

In rural sideline production, women are a main force. Rural women in the northeastern provinces generally participate in sideline production such as weaving mats, weaving straw hats, spinning thread, making ropes, and collecting herbs. Women in the southern provinces engage in sideline production such as raising silkworms and raising fish. According to statistics from Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province, the county's women produced 4.83 million catties of silkworm cocoons last spring.

Women have also actively participated in projects such as drought and flood prevention and water conservancy construction. Last year, a total of more than 21,000 women in eight special districts of Fujian Province participated in the construction of water conservancy projects. More than 92,000 women in Ningxia Province built more than 50,000 large and small branch canals. In order to maintain water and soil and regulate the climate, many women also participated in afforestation.

A large number of female labor models have emerged in rural production work. According to statistics from Hebei, Shanxi, Songjiang, Hunan, and Shandong provinces last year, 787 women attended provincial agricultural labor model conferences. In Hebei and Shanxi provinces, a total of more than 1,000 women served as presidents and vice presidents of agricultural production cooperatives, and there were even more who served as leaders of agricultural mutual aid groups. In various places, many outstanding working women have been elected as representatives to township people's congresses and hold administrative positions such as township heads and village heads. Due to the emergence of a large number of model figures among rural women, under their leadership and guidance, the direct participation of the broad masses of rural women in agricultural production has been greatly promoted.

With the development of agricultural production, the social and family status of rural women has greatly improved, and their economic and cultural lives have also been greatly improved. In many mutual aid and cooperative organizations, equal pay for equal work between men and women has begun to be achieved, gradually improving the family status of women. In a small number of democratic and harmonious families, women and men have the right to jointly handle family property. The number of female students in rural areas is increasing. Young and middle-aged women generally attend winter schools and literacy classes. Maternal and child health, new methods of delivery, and knowledge of childcare are being promoted in rural areas.

    广大妇女参加祖国工农业生产
    随着我国经济建设的发展，全国许多妇女积极参加了工业生产；她们在生产工作上所获得的成就，给广大妇女指出了参加国家工业建设的广阔前途。
    女工占百分之六十以上的纺织工业，是中国最大工业之一。以解放前最高年产量为一百计算，一九五二年棉纱产量到达一百五十一点一，棉布产量到达一百六十四点八。这说明女纺织工人的生产效率已有显著的提高。如国营棉纺厂女工的平均看台能力，一九四九年能看普通布机二台到四台、自动布机十二台到十六台，到一九五二年即能看普通布机六台到八台，自动布机二十四台到三十二台。女工的看锭能力也有很大提高。一九四九年平均每人可看三百锭到四百锭，一九五二年增加到六百锭到八百锭。有些杰出的女工，如天津棉纺五厂的女工宁淑珍、马淑芳等，看锭能力更高达一千一百锭以上。
    在中国历史上从来没有妇女参加过的工作，现在妇女都参加了。旅大市女工中，许多人掌握了使用车床、修船或翻砂等工业技术。鞍山钢铁公司某号高炉炉长吴元愉，和男工们一起进行生产。在铁路上出现了妇女车务包乘组和女调度员。现在，不论在炼钢炉旁、机械车间、铸造厂、电气室、化验室、船坞内、自动纺织机前，都可以看到妇女们在熟练地进行着生产。仅仅在几年前，这些人还是学生或者是家庭妇女，但是新中国把她们培养成为新型的人物。
    妇女们在生产上创造了许多先进工作法。纺织工业方面出现了著名的郝建秀工作法，这一工作法的推广，为国家节省了大量的财富。松江省橡胶一厂女工景淑珍创造了不停机落纱法，一台机在一年中就可以为国家创造一万七千四百四十二吨粮食的价值。东北机械九厂女工王连芬运用多刀多刃切削法，找出了用六把刀车弧度垫圈的窍门，使生产效率提高了七倍。各地出现了许多女劳动模范和先进工作者。据统计，仅工业上的女劳动模范，就占全国工业劳动模范总数的百分之十二强。很多优秀女工已被提拔为工厂行政干部或技术干部。有些担任着经理、厂长和车间主任等职务。在交通事业方面有不少女工已担任站长、客运主任、客运列车长、运输车长等职务。
    由于参加国家建设工作，积极进行生产，妇女们的政治地位已大大提高。很多女工被选举为各级人民代表会议的代表和政府委员，管理着国家事务。女工的生活福利待遇也已有显著的改善，各地工厂都实行了男女同工同酬。女工生产假期中照发工资的规定，已在较大的工厂中执行。在北京、天津、沈阳、上海等地的工厂中，经常为女工进行产前产后的身体检查，举办妇婴卫生讲座，建立托儿所和妇幼保健站，使她们安心进行生产。成千成万的女工，搬进了新建的工人宿舍，有的女劳动模范正在青岛、西湖等地为他们特设的休养所中休养着。各地女工并参加了业余学习和专门技术学习，很多人都当选了学习模范。（新华社）
    全国广大农村妇女在参加农业生产运动中，对全国农业生产的恢复和发展起了巨大作用。
    全国参加农业生产的妇女，约占农村妇女劳动力的总数的百分之六十左右。有的地区达到百分之八九十。在爱国增产运动中，有相当数量的农村妇女参加了农业主要劳动。最近两年来，农业生产的特点之一，是广大的农村劳动妇女，纷纷参加各种形式的劳动互助组织。一九五二年参加各种劳动互助组织的妇女占全国农村妇女劳动力的百分之三十以上。由于参加农业生产的男女农民共同积极生产，全国农业生产量逐年上升。广大农村妇女除参加春播、秋收、积肥等田间劳动外，还学会了选种、种子消毒、治虫等技术。安徽省去年有二十八万多个妇女参加了治虫工作，救出禾苗三十七万五千多亩。妇女们对于学习新的生产知识和技术都非常积极。不少妇女参加了农业技术训练站，学习农业先进经验及农业生产知识和技术，其中有少数妇女学会了使用新式农具。据去年河北省三十二个县的统计，有十二万个妇女参加了技术传授站学习。据松江省十三个县的统计，学会使用马拉农具、锄草机和铲?机的已有二百七十多人。
    在农村的副业生产中，妇女是一支主力军。东北各省的农村妇女普遍参加编席、编草帽、纺线、打绳和采药等副业生产。南方各省的妇女进行养蚕和养鱼等副业生产。据浙江省宁海县的统计，去年春季全县妇女养蚕产茧达四百八十三万斤。
    妇女们还积极参加了防治旱涝、兴修水利等工程。去年，福建省八个专区共有二万一千多个妇女参加修建水利工程。宁夏全省九万二千多个妇女开筑了大小支渠五万多条。为保持水土调剂气候，不少妇女还参加植树造林。
    在农村生产工作中，涌现了大批的妇女劳动模范。据河北、山西、松江、湖南、山东五个省去年的统计，妇女出席省农业劳动模范大会的有七百八十七人。河北、山西两省妇女担任农业生产合作社正副社长的共有一千余人，担任农业互助组长的就更多。各地有不少杰出的劳动妇女被选为乡人民代表会议的代表，和担任乡长、村长等行政职务。由于农村妇女中出现了大批模范人物，在她们的带头和领导下，大大地推动了广大农村妇女直接参加农业生产。
    随着农业生产的发展，农村妇女的社会地位和家庭地位大大提高，经济和文化生活也大大改进。在不少互助合作组织中已开始做到男女同劳同酬，逐步地提高了妇女的家庭地位。少数民主和睦家庭中，妇女和男子有共同处理家庭财产的权利。农村的女学生正在增加着。青壮年妇女普遍地上了冬学和民校。妇幼卫生、新法接生和育儿知识，正在农村中推行着。（新华社）
