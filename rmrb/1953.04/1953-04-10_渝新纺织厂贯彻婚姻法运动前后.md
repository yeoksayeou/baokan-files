After movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, democratic reforms, and wage reforms, the workers of the Yuxin Textile Factory in Chongqing greatly increased their production enthusiasm. However, some workers were still in low spirits, often with their bodies in the workshop but their minds elsewhere. Spinners were letting the roving frames fill with white fluff, and weavers were producing large pieces of flawed cloth. Some people's fingers were getting caught in the machines, and others even had their ears injured. When asked why they were like this, they were too embarrassed to say. It turned out that many of them were quarreling with their husbands or wives.

In the Yuxin Textile Factory, there were more than 1,800 married male and female workers. Among their family members, there were 1,024 adults alone. Most couples had married before liberation, and quarrels and arguments occurred frequently. During trade union meetings discussing production, welfare, or cultural and recreational activities, tearful men and women would often suddenly burst in to complain. The fifteen members of the Workers' Family Committee spent most of their time mediating. They ran east and west, only to have one problem arise after another was solved.

The forms and reasons for marital disputes were varied. These included fear of pregnancy, lack of transparency in family finances, infidelity, and dissatisfaction with a partner's age or appearance. The most significant and widespread cause was the persistence of feudal remnants in many people's minds: some male workers looked down on housework and considered their family members inferior. For example, Luo Chengju beat his wife until she bled and still believed that his wife "eats what is mine, wears what is mine, has what is mine on her head, and stands on what is mine, even her bones and flesh are mine." Some male workers greatly belittled housework and vehemently prevented their wives from participating in work, study, cultural activities, and various social events. Zou Jiping's wife often got beaten by her husband for going home after meetings. Chen Yunxiang did not allow his wife to enter a technical school, fearing that she would abandon him if she became too skilled. There were even more who prevented their wives from dancing. Some female workers and family members also frequently argued because their husbands danced or participated in social activities. Some male workers also disliked their wives for not bearing children, for not continuing the family line. Some even cursed women: "Raising pigs produces manure, and chickens lay eggs, but I'm raising a useless person!" Some female workers and family members who gave birth to girls were met with frowns from the whole family. A male worker named Wang Hanyun even tried to suffocate his baby girl several times. Some male workers didn't care for sons or daughters, wanting their wives to use their wages to feed and clothe them while keeping their own wages in the bank, beyond their wives' reach.

Regardless of the cause, whether it was beating and cursing or being beaten and cursed, it ultimately made everyone unstable, uneasy, and unable to focus on their work.

In the old society, which family's stove didn't smoke, and which couple didn't argue? However, in New China, marital disputes were no longer merely so-called private matters belonging to individuals, especially in factories, during the period of large-scale national economic construction. Therefore, under the slogan of "removing obstacles to production," the Yuxin Textile Factory launched a campaign to implement the Marriage Law. After ten days or so of large and small meetings, visits, heart-to-heart talks, and study mobilizations, everyone thought over and over again, and many people gradually became enlightened, their eyes brightened, and they saw many principles that they had not seen before.

Before the study, Li Xianglong saw many couples working in pairs in the factory and became increasingly displeased and annoyed with his non-working wife, Luo Juying. After the study, Li Xianglong suddenly remembered: "Didn't Luo Juying also work as a fine yarn worker before liberation? She only lost her job because she became pregnant. If it were now, wouldn't she also be a worker?" Workers like Li Xianglong understood: it was the old society that prevented women from working. In the future, when the country is better built, and there are more canteens and nurseries, family members will also be able to become workers!

Before the study, Wang Wenyuan held back his wife, repeatedly preventing her from attending evening school. He said, "You are the housekeeper and childminder. It's not too late to study after the children are dead!" After the study, he thought, "In the new society, can family members be trapped at home forever?" He allowed his wife to register for evening school. Chen Yunxiang also allowed his wife to enter a technical school for the same reason. Many workers also helped their wives with their studies and encouraged them to do well as hygiene group leaders and security committee members.

Before the study, Peng Jicheng said his wife was an idler. After the study, he suddenly realized that his wife was a very busy person. Look at her, taking care of two children, washing and mending clothes, sweeping the floor, and cooking meals, busy inside and out, without even a Sunday off. He thought, "Wouldn't hiring a servant cost several dou of rice per month? How can I blame her for being an idler?" Male workers like Peng Jicheng suddenly felt sorry for their wives. On Sundays, they helped their wives sweep the floor, cook, and hold the children.

Before the study, Zhang Yushan cursed his wife for giving birth to a daughter, yelling, "You only give me thieves!" After the study, he said, "Men and women are equal; valuing men over women is feudal thinking!" Therefore, fathers like Zhang Yushan also knew to buy some colorful cloth and candy for their daughters. Those male and female workers without sons or daughters also knew that today is not the old era of "raising sons to provide for old age" and did not need to be sad.

Before the study, there were 475 families with disharmony. After the study, 442 of them reconciled. Among the 94 people who previously requested a divorce, 74 have now reconciled. Husbands no longer beat their wives, and wives no longer refused to cook for their husbands. Eighty percent of families signed covenants, writing things like "Husbands and wives live in harmony to promote production." When Wu Deqing and Huang Shiying signed their covenant, they tidied up their room as if it were a new wedding room, and even invited many people to hold a meeting and drink tea. Now, husbands took out their wages that they were reluctant to hand over from the pockets of their close-fitting clothes, and wives took out their private savings from the corners of the walls. Female workers who moved into the factory dormitory and refused to go home returned home, and enemies who used to turn their backs on each other talked face-to-face. The whole family came and went with smiles, and children were also beaten less often. The members of the Workers' Family Committee also freed up their time and used most of their energy to lead sanitation work and evening schools.

Now, the workers of the Yuxin Textile Factory were working wholeheartedly in the factory, no longer having divided attention. Wang Hanyun no longer secretly sneaked home during work hours to monitor his wife. Chen Lihui, who used to spin 35 carts of yarn, now spun 40 carts, and said, "Spinning carts now feels like no effort at all." Gong Sufen, who used to produce two or three pounds of white fluff when watching 20 roving frames, now produces only fourteen ounces of white fluff when watching 40 roving frames. Long Yongshu, a weaver who used to feel strained watching four machines, now watches six machines and still meets the quota. Unmarried female workers used to look down on pregnant women,嫌they were clumsy and dragged people down; now they said, "Being pregnant is so exhausting!" and scrambled to help pregnant women carry spinning boxes and sweep the floor, preventing them from doing heavy work or bending over. Pregnant female workers also understood that they were making a glorious double contribution to the country and were no longer frowning.

Clearing away feudal remnants and establishing democratic and harmonious families removed an obstacle to large-scale production and construction. Now, the Yuxin Textile Factory has launched a production reform movement. Workers and couples are encouraging and challenging each other in competitions, full of confidence, to continue to remove other backward, conservative, unreasonable, and unfavorable production obstacles one by one for the sake of national construction.

    渝新纺织厂贯彻婚姻法运动前后
    刘衡
    重庆渝新纺织厂的工人们经过镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”、民主改革、工资改革等运动，生产热情大大地提高了。可是有一些工人情绪还是不好，常常身在车间心在外。纺纱的弄得毛棍尽开白花，织布的尽出大块大块的破布，有的人手指头被机器轧伤，有的人连耳朵也被机器打得吊起。要问他们为什么会这样，他们还不好意思说。原来他们当中很多人是因为跟丈夫或者是老婆呕气。
    渝新纺织厂的男女职工结了婚的有一千八百多人。家属中光是成年人就有一千零二十四个。大部分夫妻是在解放以前成的亲，呕气吵架的事经常发生。正在讨论生产、福利或者是文化娱乐工作的工会会议上，常常突然闯进一些哭哭啼啼的告状男女。工人家属委员会的十五个委员，大部分时间是忙调解的事。他们一会儿跑东，一会儿跑西，按倒葫芦瓢又起。
    夫妻闹架的形式和原因是各种各样的。像怕怀娃娃、家庭经济不公开、喜新厌旧以及嫌对方老啦、丑啦等等。而最主要最普遍的原因是许多人有一脑袋封建残余思想：有一些男工瞧不起家务劳动，认为家属低人一等。像罗成矩把老婆打得流血，还认为老婆“吃的是我的，穿的是我的，头顶的是我的，脚踩的是我的，连骨头肉都是我的。”有一些男工十分轻视家务活，又极力阻挡老婆参加工作、学习、文化娱乐和各种社会活动。邹吉平的老婆开会回家，常常要挨丈夫一阵痛打。陈云祥不让老婆进技术学校，害怕她学好了不要他。至于阻挡老婆跳舞的就更多。有一些女工和家属因为丈夫跳舞或参加社会活动，也常发生争吵。还有一些男工嫌老婆不生娃娃，没有替自己留种传代。有的还乱骂女人：“养猪有屎鸡有蛋，我养了你一个空人！”有一些女工和工属生了娃娃，可是生的是女的，惹得一家人都噘嘴。有一个名叫王汉云的男工还几次动手想把女娃娃闷死。有的男工对男娃女娃都不爱，全要老婆拿工资管他吃穿，自己的工资存到银行，妻子管不着。
    不管是由于什么原因，也不管是打人骂人或者是挨打挨骂，总归是弄得大家立不稳，坐不安，干活干不上心。
    本来，在旧社会，谁家的灶火不冒烟，哪有夫妻不吵架的？可是，在新中国，夫妻吵架就不仅仅是属于个人的所谓私事了。特别是在工厂，在国家进行大规模经济建设的时候。因此，在“为生产扫除障碍”的口号下，渝新纺织厂展开了贯彻婚姻法运动。经过十来天的大会小会，访问谈心，学习动员，大家反来覆去地想，慢慢地许多人的心开窍了，眼也亮了，看清了许多过去看不清的道理。
    学习以前，李祥龙看见许多夫妻一对一对地在厂子里干活，就对自己没有作工的老婆罗菊英越看越不顺眼，越看越心烦。学习以后，李祥龙突然记起来了：“解放以前，罗菊英不也做过细纱工吗？只是因为肚子大了才失了业。要是搁在现在，不也是个工人？”像李祥龙那样的工人们都明白了：这是旧社会不让女人做工呀，将来国家建设好，食堂和托儿所多了，家属不一样可当工人！
    学习以前，王文元扯后腿，几次三番地不让老婆进业余学校。他说：“你是管家带娃的，等娃娃死了再学不迟！”学习以后，他想：“在新社会，还能让家属困在家里一辈子？”就让老婆到业余学校报名了。陈云祥也因同样的道理，让老婆进了技术学校。许多工人还帮老婆补课，鼓励她们做好她们所担任的卫生组长和治安委员。
    学习以前，彭继成说老婆是吃闲饭的。学习以后，他忽然发现老婆是一个大忙人。你看她呀，拉扯着两个娃娃，又是洗衣补烂，又是扫地做饭，忙里忙外，连个星期天都没有。他想：“请一个雇工不是每月还得几斗米吗？怎么怪她吃闲饭？”像彭继成那样的男工们，一下子都心疼起老婆来了。星期天，又帮老婆扫地，又帮老婆弄饭，还抱娃娃。
    学习以前，张玉山的老婆生了女娃娃，张玉山指着她的鼻子大骂：“你尽给我生一些强盗！”学习以后，他说：“男女一般高，重男轻女就是封建思想！”于是，像张玉山这样的爸爸们，也知道给女娃买些花布和糖果了。那些没儿没女的男女工人们，也知道今天不是“养儿防老”的旧时代了，用不着伤心。
    学习以前，家庭不和的有四百七十五人，学习以后，和好的四百四十二人。以前要求离婚的九十四人中，现在和好的已有七十四人。丈夫不再打老婆了，老婆也不再不给丈夫做饭吃。百分之八十的家庭订了公约，上边写着“夫妻和睦搞生产”之类的话。吴德清、黄世英夫妇订公约的时候，把房间收拾得就跟新房一样，还请许多人开了会，喝了茶。现在，丈夫从贴身衣服的口袋里摸出了不肯交出的工资，老婆从墙角落里掏出了私房钱；搬进工厂宿舍不肯回家的女工回家了，反贴门神不对脸的冤家们当面对口的谈心了。全家笑脸出、笑脸进，娃娃也很少有挨打的了。工人家属委员会的委员们也都腾出了时间，用绝大部分力量领导卫生工作，领导业余学校了。
    现在，渝新纺织厂的工人们都安安心心地在厂子里搞生产，再也不一心挂两头了。王汉云不再在上工时间偷偷闯回家去监视老婆了。原先摇三十五车纱的陈立辉摇到了四十车，还说：“现在摇车活好像一点也不费力。”原先看二十根毛辊要出两三磅白花的龚素芬现在看四十根毛辊，只出十四两白花。原先看四台车感到吃力的布场工人龙永淑，现在看六台车还达到了定额。原先未婚女工瞧不起大肚子，嫌她们笨呆呆地尽拖累人；现在她们说：“怀娃娃好费力哟！”抢着帮大肚子搬纺箱、扫车脚，不让她们做重活、做弯腰活。大肚子女工也明白她们是在为国家作光荣的双重生产，不再愁眉苦脸了。
    肃清封建残余思想，建立民主和睦家庭，为大规模的生产建设扫除了一个障碍。现在，渝新纺织厂展开了生产改革运动，工人们、夫妻们正互相鼓励，互相挑战比赛，满怀着信心，要把其他落后的、保守的、不合理的、不利于国家建设的生产障碍一个一个地继续扫除掉。
