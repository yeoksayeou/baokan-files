Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 22nd: TASS, Berlin, April 21st—The International Democratic Women’s Federation issued a statement to the press welcoming the new proposals made by the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on ending the Korean War.

The statement pointed out: Now, the door to achieving peace in Korea has been opened. It is now possible to end this issue that has shaken world opinion for three years. People from extremely different strata of all countries around the world are demanding a peaceful resolution to this issue, and this demand is growing stronger and stronger. Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal makes it possible to achieve peace in Korea.

The International Democratic Women's Federation calls on women from all countries around the world to support this proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: People from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic warmly welcome the statements by China, Korea, and the Soviet Union on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

According to a report from the German News Agency, Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said in his article entitled "There is a Force That Can Solve the German Problem": The working people of the German Democratic Republic unreservedly welcome the peaceful proposals of the Soviet, Chinese, and Korean governments to end the Korean War, which ease international tensions. Ulbricht's words have been confirmed by the attitudes of people from all walks of life with various religious beliefs and political views.

Wagner, a pastor from Raben, said: "The agreement on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war in Korea proves once again that it is possible for capitalist countries to reach understandings with democratic countries. Similarly, it is possible to end the unnecessary bloodshed and allow the Korean people to return to peaceful life. The German problem can also be resolved with the same peaceful sincerity. Foreign Minister Molotov's statement is in line with the wishes of the vast majority of the German people."

Karl Kleinschmidt, a pastor from Schwerin, emphasized that Molotov's statement filled all German patriots with confidence and hope. He said: "The Soviet Union's proposal to immediately convene a four-power conference to peacefully resolve the German issue is dangerous for Adenauer's traitorous regime."

Otto Intreß, a laboring farmer from Nötschütz, said: "We Germans have gained new courage from Molotov's statement."

    国际民主妇联支持中朝关于朝鲜问题建议
    民主德国各阶层人民热烈欢迎中朝苏三国的声明
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：国际民主妇女联合会向报界发表声明，欢迎中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出的关于结束朝鲜战争的新建议。
    声明指出：现在，在朝鲜实现和平的大门已经敞开了。现在已经有可能结束这个震动世界舆论达三年之久的问题了。全世界各国的极端不同阶层的人们都要求和平解决这个问题，而且这种要求越来越强烈了。中华人民共和国总理周恩来的建议，使得在朝鲜实现和平成为可能。
    国际民主妇女联合会要求全世界各国的妇女支持这个建议。
    【新华社二十二日讯】德意志民主共和国各阶层人民热烈地欢迎中国、朝鲜、苏联关于和平解决朝鲜问题的声明。
    据德意志通讯社报道，德国统一社会党中央委员会总书记乌布利希在他的题为“有一支力量能解决德国问题”的文章中说：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民毫无保留地欢迎苏联、中国和朝鲜政府结束朝鲜战争的和平建议使国际紧张形势趋于缓和。乌布利希的话已经从有着各种宗教信仰和政治见解的各阶层人民的态度中得到证实。
    拉本的瓦格纳牧师说：“关于交换朝鲜病伤战俘的协议再一次证明，资本主义国家与民主国家是可能达成谅解的。同样，结束无谓的流血并使朝鲜人民重过和平生活也是可能的。德国问题也可以用同样的和平诚意来解决。莫洛托夫外长的声明符合绝大多数德国人民的愿望。”
    什未林的卡尔·克莱恩施米特牧师强调指出，莫洛托夫的声明使所有的德国爱国人民都充满了信心和希望。他说：“苏联坚持立即召开四国会议以和平解决德国问题的建议，对于阿登纳的卖国政权来说，是危险的。”
    诺斯特立茨区的劳动农民奥托·殷特莱斯说：“我们德国人由莫洛托夫的声明里得到了新的勇气。”
