    Korean Armistice Talks: Korean-Chinese Delegation Issues Communiqué
    Third Group of Our Captured Personnel Returns to the Motherland
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 22] The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communiqué on April 22:
    On April 22, our side repatriated 100 sick and wounded Korean prisoners of war to the other side, and the other side repatriated 350 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and 150 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Chinese People's Volunteers to our side.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 22] On the 22nd, another 350 captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and 150 captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers returned to our receiving area, where the Korean and Chinese flags were flying and the words "Embrace of the Motherland" were prominently displayed. The captured personnel repatriated on the 22nd brought back dozens of national flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, which they had made at great risk in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps using blue cloth, towels, cotton thread, and red and blue ink. As they got off the U.S. ambulances and onto our ambulances, they sang Korean and Chinese revolutionary songs and songs they had written themselves in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps: "Although we have suffered all kinds of abuse, our will is strong, and we must return to the motherland!" Many of our captured personnel, even though their legs had been amputated, were overjoyed to see their relatives from the motherland and threw away their crutches, eager to get off the vehicles. Many people, when getting off the U.S. ambulances, threw away everything except the shirts and underwear they were wearing. Many disabled captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers even wrote on their shirts in blue ink: "Demand blood debt repayment from the American imperialists!"
    According to our captured personnel, they were also subjected to abuse by the U.S. side during repatriation. After landing at Busan from Geoje Island, they were guarded by U.S. soldiers with live ammunition, 25 people to a guard, and locked in a tent with no furnishings for a day and a night, freezing. The train from Busan to Munsan was very crowded, and many seriously ill people could not lie down. The doors and windows of the car were tightly closed, and the air was not circulating, causing most people to have fevers. When our captured personnel, unable to bear the stuffiness, opened the car window by two inches, the U.S. escorts discovered it and punished the entire car by forbidding them to sleep. When the train stopped, the U.S. escorts got off and pointed their bayonets at the car doors. Armed personnel monitored our captured personnel when they urinated or defecated, and many people were beaten for taking slightly longer to urinate or for dressing too slowly.
    On the 22nd, our side repatriated one hundred Korean prisoners of war to the other side. When these Korean prisoners of war got out of our ambulances, only our staff were there to help them, and no American personnel were there to assist them.

    朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团发表公报
    第三批我被俘人员返回祖国怀抱
    【新华社开城二十二日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十二日发表公报如下：
    四月二十二日，我方遣返给对方朝鲜籍病伤被俘人员一百人，对方遣返给我方朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员三百五十人，中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员一百五十人。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】二十二日又有朝鲜人民军被俘人员三百五十名和中国人民志愿军被俘人员一百五十名，回到了飘扬着朝中国旗和高挂着“祖国怀抱”字样的我方接收区。二十二日被遣返的被俘人员带回了数十面朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的国旗，这些国旗都是他们在美方战俘营中冒着极大的危险，用蓝布、毛巾、棉线和红蓝墨水染制成的。他们在走下美方救护车，乘上我方救护车时，都唱着朝中革命歌曲和他们在美方战俘营中自编的歌曲：“虽然我们受尽种种虐待，但是我们意志坚强，我们一定要返回祖国！”很多我方被俘人员虽然两腿已截断，但看见祖国的亲人后，都狂喜得扔了拐棍，急着要下车。很多人走下美方的救护车时，除了留下穿在身上的衬衣衬裤外，都把其余所有的东西都扔掉了。很多残废的中国人民志愿军被俘人员还在衬衣上用蓝墨水写着：“向美帝讨还血债！”
    据我方被俘人员谈，他们在遣返途中还受到美方的虐待。他们从巨济岛到釜山上岸后，每二十五个人被一个荷枪实弹的美军押送，关进一个没有任何布置的帐篷中，冻了一天一夜。从釜山到汶山的火车上非常拥挤，许多患重病的人也不能躺下。车上门窗紧闭，空气不流通，致使大多数人都发烧。我被俘人员在闷得无法忍受后，将车窗打开二寸，被美方押送人员发觉，竟罚全车厢的人不准睡觉。火车停站时，美方押送人员就下车，端起刺刀对着车门。我被俘人员大小便时都有武装人员监视，有许多人因为小便时间稍长或衣服穿得较慢，就遭到殴打。
    二十二日我方遣送给对方的是朝鲜籍战俘一百人。这些朝鲜战俘从我方救护车下来时，只有我方工作人员在旁扶架，没有一个美国人员扶架他们。
