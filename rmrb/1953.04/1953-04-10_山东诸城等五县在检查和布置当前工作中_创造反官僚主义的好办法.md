Editor's Note: The Zhucheng and other five counties in Shandong Province have correctly resolved the problems of combating bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline by convening a meeting of cadres at the county, district, and township levels by the county party committee. This approach is good. They did not hold meetings specifically to combat bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, but rather to review past work and deploy future work. The struggle against bureaucracy was launched within this meeting, with the county party committee first conducting a profound self-criticism, guiding district and township cadres to offer criticisms to the county and district, and broadly carrying out self-criticism. The meeting not only criticized bad people and bad deeds but also commended good people and good deeds, so that everyone would know how to work after removing commandism. By doing so, the broad masses of cadres were united and educated to become aware. All localities can do this, and the more leadership and preparation, the better.

[Report from our newspaper] The Zhucheng, Wulian, Cangma, Jiaonan, and Jiaohe county party committees in the Jiaozhou area of Shandong Province, from late February to early March, respectively convened a conference of three-level cadres at the county, district, and township levels. Combining the summary of winter work with the deployment of spring work, they implemented the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline through the rectification method of criticism and self-criticism, and the conference achieved good results. In each county, the number of district, township, and county-level cadres attending ranged from 776 to 1,400. At the beginning of the meeting, the county party committees first conducted a profound review of the serious bureaucratic style of leadership through the summary of winter work, linking to specific facts, reviewed the commandism of some district and township cadres caused by the bureaucracy of the leadership, criticized the illegal and undisciplined behavior of individual district and township cadres, and analyzed its harm and danger from the perspective of the party's policies and the interests of the masses. At the same time, responsible cadres of departments with serious bureaucracy and commandism in each county also made self-criticisms at the meeting. The problems reviewed and exposed by the county party committee made the cadres attending the meeting realize the seriousness of the three aspects of problems and the serious harm to the Party and the people, thus raising their ideological awareness, and sharply criticizing the bureaucratic style of leadership in group and plenary discussions. Many problems that the county party committee had not realized and problems that were originally considered unimportant were raised. For example, some district and township cadres in Jiaonan County criticized the county party committee saying: "When deploying the digging of wells, because our district is a mountainous area, we proposed that wells could not be dug, but the leadership did not adopt this opinion and simply pursued numbers, saying that digging in the ditch would also be fine. As a result, digging wells in the ditch could not play a role and wasted manpower and money." This reflects that there is also a serious commandist style in the leadership of the county party committee. Cadres in the twelfth district of Jiaonan County analyzed and criticized the harm of bureaucracy and the pursuit of numbers to the work and to the masses from the account of the waste of manpower and money in digging wells. These criticisms profoundly educated the leading cadres and educated the cadres.

On the other hand, the county party committee's sincere self-criticism and humble listening to the criticisms from below enlightened and educated the cadres attending the meeting. Many district and township cadres automatically reviewed their own coercion and command, and boldly and extensively criticized and exposed the coercion and command of district and township cadres and the illegal and undisciplined behavior of a few cadres. After the Jiaonan County Party Committee reviewed the bureaucratic style of leadership, the cadres below reflected: "We now know that the bureaucracy above is the root cause of the commandism below. Now that the county party committee has reviewed itself, we must also review ourselves well." "The tasks assigned by the higher authorities are all beneficial to the masses, but because we coerced and commanded in our work, we spoiled many good things. In the future, we must transform our style and be determined to overcome coercion and command." Wang Renyu, the organization member of the Zhigou District Committee in Zhucheng County, said: "I would be letting the Party down if I didn't review myself." He reviewed his mistakes in preventing freedom of marriage and supporting militiamen in beating people. Some township cadres in Cangma County said: "This time the county party committee is really determined, even the roots have been pulled out in the review, and we must also review ourselves well. We must boldly expose the problems of district cadres. If they give us 'small shoes' to wear, we will appeal to the county, and if the county doesn't work, we will appeal all the way to the central government." Zhu Yeben, the township head of Xiaopo Township in the fourth district of Jiaohe County, painfully reviewed his mistakes in beating and scolding the masses after listening to the county party committee's review, saying: "This time I realized that the party at the higher level does not kick cadres away. As long as we boldly review ourselves, the masses will forgive us. I will definitely make a thorough review at the township representative meeting when I go back." Lu Maoqing, the township head of Caoqiao Township in the fourth district of the county, said in his speech at the conference: "I want to say what I haven't dared to say for several years today." He specifically exposed the facts that Ding Mingwen, the secretary of the township branch, and Chen Huanzhai, the public security officer of the district, raped women and beat the masses (in the past, Lu Maoqing had been severely retaliated against for making suggestions to them) and sharply criticized the bureaucracy of the leading cadres of the county party committee and the district party committee. At the same time, he reviewed his mistakes in falsely reporting work achievements to deceive the district party committee and expressed his determination to correct them. Each county also selected cadres with a bad style, organized a general review, and some counties combined the handling of bad people and bad deeds, further deepening the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

The problems exposed at the conferences in each county were extremely serious. For example, Cangma County revealed that in 1951 there were 140 cases of random beating of people, and in 1952 there were 91 cases, including 208 township cadres and 23 district cadres. At the same time, 25 relatively prominent cases were exposed. After checking and exposing these serious situations, leading cadres were further educated, and the cadres attending the meeting were awakened, making everyone deeply realize the harm of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline to the Party and the people and the importance of launching this struggle. Everyone said: "If we don't oppose it anymore, there is a danger of losing our heads." Thus, various personal considerations of individualism were eliminated, and a correct attitude was established. Everyone said: Resolutely change the work style and actively lead and carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

After criticizing the work style of coercion and command, which is not the mass line, because the correct standard of work style has not yet been established, many cadres reflected: "Coercion and command are not right, but we still don't know the mass line, and it will be difficult to work in the future." They all urgently requested the leadership to teach them methods. According to this situation, each county selected a group of cadres with a democratic style and good at taking the mass line, and let them make typical introductions at the conference for education. Jiaonan County introduced 19 typical examples at the meeting. For example, Comrade Tang JinÈ°è, the secretary of the Hexi Township Branch in the sixth district, often led the township government to hold township people's representative meetings, promoted democracy, and consulted with the masses on everything. Therefore, various work tasks were completed very well. The district armed forces cadre of Jiaohe County introduced how he used the method of patient persuasion to do a good job in universal training of militiamen and the establishment of backbone regiments. Cangma County also introduced the typical example of Li Lunchang taking the mass line and consolidating and improving mutual aid groups. Through typical introductions, the standard of correct work style was established, the cadres attending the meeting were educated, and the erroneous perception of a few cadres that "committing coercion and command when doing work, and not committing coercion and command when not doing work" and "being responsible to the higher authorities means not being responsible to the masses" was also eliminated. Everyone realized: "As long as we consult with the masses on everything, any work can be done well."

The three-level cadres' meetings held in these counties deployed spring production work on the basis of improving ideology and rectifying work style. When deploying, attention was paid to the following two issues: 1. Deploy work from reality, explain tasks, explain policies, explain work methods, and explain work style. The numbers of tasks and deadlines are only given in general terms and not rigidly stipulated. The main emphasis is on ideological education, emphasizing mastering policies, and emphasizing taking the mass line. The leadership also paid attention to considering from all aspects to solve the difficulties in the work of the lower levels. The work plan should be discussed democratically by everyone, and opinions and difficulties should be put forward so that the plan is realistic. For example, in the spring production plan of Zhucheng County, the original determination was to focus on the fifth, thirteenth, and sixteenth districts for well digging. After everyone's discussion, the cadres of the thirteenth district proposed that only two townships in their area have the conditions for well digging, and the fifth district has quicksand and cannot be used as a key well digging area. If it is not corrected, it will inevitably cause the lower levels to coerce and command. Some districts proposed that their area has the conditions for well digging and a work foundation, which can be used as a key well digging area. The county party committee revised it according to everyone's opinions, and the plan became more realistic, which enabled the lower levels to have a way to complete it. 2. Specifically help district and township cadres study and improve work methods. First, the leading cadres made reports to establish correct standards, and then led everyone to conduct seminars and discussions in conjunction with local examples. Some counties also organized cadres to specifically study the working methods of model township head Li Ruilan in taking the mass line. In this way, the cadres were armed ideologically and stylistically.

Through the above practices, on the one hand, bureaucracy in leadership and commandism in grass-roots organizations were opposed; on the other hand, positive education was carried out, correct standards were established, and the work style of the mass line was implemented. Through these meetings, the leadership was both inspected and improved, and the cadres were both educated and improved, and the work was smoothly implemented. The cadres attending the meeting in each county felt that this meeting was very helpful to their education. Some said: "This is the first time I have attended such a meeting since I became a cadre." "I used to think that a little problem didn't matter, but coming to this meeting is like preventing disease before it happens." Everyone generally reflected: "This time the work deployment is specific, and there are also methods. We must never commit coercion and command again!" "I didn't know how to take the mass line before, but after this meeting, I have found the way. I should have done it this way earlier. Who would have committed coercion and command?"
