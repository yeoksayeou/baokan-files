Editor's Note: The Zhucheng and other five counties in Shandong Province have correctly resolved the problems of combating bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline by convening a meeting of cadres at the county, district, and township levels by the county party committee. This approach is good. They did not hold meetings specifically to combat bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, but rather to review past work and deploy future work. The struggle against bureaucracy was launched within this meeting, with the county party committee first conducting a profound self-criticism, guiding district and township cadres to offer criticisms to the county and district, and broadly carrying out self-criticism. The meeting not only criticized bad people and bad deeds but also commended good people and good deeds, so that everyone would know how to work after removing commandism. By doing so, the broad masses of cadres were united and educated to become aware. All localities can do this, and the more leadership and preparation, the better.

[Report from our newspaper] The Zhucheng, Wulian, Cangma, Jiaonan, and Jiaohe county party committees in the Jiaozhou area of Shandong Province, from late February to early March, respectively convened a conference of three-level cadres at the county, district, and township levels. Combining the summary of winter work with the deployment of spring work, they implemented the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline through the rectification method of criticism and self-criticism, and the conference achieved good results. In each county, the number of district, township, and county-level cadres attending ranged from 776 to 1,400. At the beginning of the meeting, the county party committees first conducted a profound review of the serious bureaucratic style of leadership through the summary of winter work, linking to specific facts, reviewed the commandism of some district and township cadres caused by the bureaucracy of the leadership, criticized the illegal and undisciplined behavior of individual district and township cadres, and analyzed its harm and danger from the perspective of the party's policies and the interests of the masses. At the same time, responsible cadres of departments with serious bureaucracy and commandism in each county also made self-criticisms at the meeting. The problems reviewed and exposed by the county party committee made the cadres attending the meeting realize the seriousness of the three aspects of problems and the serious harm to the Party and the people, thus raising their ideological awareness, and sharply criticizing the bureaucratic style of leadership in group and plenary discussions. Many problems that the county party committee had not realized and problems that were originally considered unimportant were raised. For example, some district and township cadres in Jiaonan County criticized the county party committee saying: "When deploying the digging of wells, because our district is a mountainous area, we proposed that wells could not be dug, but the leadership did not adopt this opinion and simply pursued numbers, saying that digging in the ditch would also be fine. As a result, digging wells in the ditch could not play a role and wasted manpower and money." This reflects that there is also a serious commandist style in the leadership of the county party committee. Cadres in the twelfth district of Jiaonan County analyzed and criticized the harm of bureaucracy and the pursuit of numbers to the work and to the masses from the account of the waste of manpower and money in digging wells. These criticisms profoundly educated the leading cadres and educated the cadres.

On the other hand, the county party committee's sincere self-criticism and humble listening to the criticisms from below enlightened and educated the cadres attending the meeting. Many district and township cadres automatically reviewed their own coercion and command, and boldly and extensively criticized and exposed the coercion and command of district and township cadres and the illegal and undisciplined behavior of a few cadres. After the Jiaonan County Party Committee reviewed the bureaucratic style of leadership, the cadres below reflected: "We now know that the bureaucracy above is the root cause of the commandism below. Now that the county party committee has reviewed itself, we must also review ourselves well." "The tasks assigned by the higher authorities are all beneficial to the masses, but because we coerced and commanded in our work, we spoiled many good things. In the future, we must transform our style and be determined to overcome coercion and command." Wang Renyu, the organization member of the Zhigou District Committee in Zhucheng County, said: "I would be letting the Party down if I didn't review myself." He reviewed his mistakes in preventing freedom of marriage and supporting militiamen in beating people. Some township cadres in Cangma County said: "This time the county party committee is really determined, even the roots have been pulled out in the review, and we must also review ourselves well. We must boldly expose the problems of district cadres. If they give us 'small shoes' to wear, we will appeal to the county, and if the county doesn't work, we will appeal all the way to the central government." Zhu Yeben, the township head of Xiaopo Township in the fourth district of Jiaohe County, painfully reviewed his mistakes in beating and scolding the masses after listening to the county party committee's review, saying: "This time I realized that the party at the higher level does not kick cadres away. As long as we boldly review ourselves, the masses will forgive us. I will definitely make a thorough review at the township representative meeting when I go back." Lu Maoqing, the township head of Caoqiao Township in the fourth district of the county, said in his speech at the conference: "I want to say what I haven't dared to say for several years today." He specifically exposed the facts that Ding Mingwen, the secretary of the township branch, and Chen Huanzhai, the public security officer of the district, raped women and beat the masses (in the past, Lu Maoqing had been severely retaliated against for making suggestions to them) and sharply criticized the bureaucracy of the leading cadres of the county party committee and the district party committee. At the same time, he reviewed his mistakes in falsely reporting work achievements to deceive the district party committee and expressed his determination to correct them. Each county also selected cadres with a bad style, organized a general review, and some counties combined the handling of bad people and bad deeds, further deepening the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

The problems exposed at the conferences in each county were extremely serious. For example, Cangma County revealed that in 1951 there were 140 cases of random beating of people, and in 1952 there were 91 cases, including 208 township cadres and 23 district cadres. At the same time, 25 relatively prominent cases were exposed. After checking and exposing these serious situations, leading cadres were further educated, and the cadres attending the meeting were awakened, making everyone deeply realize the harm of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline to the Party and the people and the importance of launching this struggle. Everyone said: "If we don't oppose it anymore, there is a danger of losing our heads." Thus, various personal considerations of individualism were eliminated, and a correct attitude was established. Everyone said: Resolutely change the work style and actively lead and carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

After criticizing the work style of coercion and command, which is not the mass line, because the correct standard of work style has not yet been established, many cadres reflected: "Coercion and command are not right, but we still don't know the mass line, and it will be difficult to work in the future." They all urgently requested the leadership to teach them methods. According to this situation, each county selected a group of cadres with a democratic style and good at taking the mass line, and let them make typical introductions at the conference for education. Jiaonan County introduced 19 typical examples at the meeting. For example, Comrade Tang Jin顏, the secretary of the Hexi Township Branch in the sixth district, often led the township government to hold township people's representative meetings, promoted democracy, and consulted with the masses on everything. Therefore, various work tasks were completed very well. The district armed forces cadre of Jiaohe County introduced how he used the method of patient persuasion to do a good job in universal training of militiamen and the establishment of backbone regiments. Cangma County also introduced the typical example of Li Lunchang taking the mass line and consolidating and improving mutual aid groups. Through typical introductions, the standard of correct work style was established, the cadres attending the meeting were educated, and the erroneous perception of a few cadres that "committing coercion and command when doing work, and not committing coercion and command when not doing work" and "being responsible to the higher authorities means not being responsible to the masses" was also eliminated. Everyone realized: "As long as we consult with the masses on everything, any work can be done well."

The three-level cadres' meetings held in these counties deployed spring production work on the basis of improving ideology and rectifying work style. When deploying, attention was paid to the following two issues: 1. Deploy work from reality, explain tasks, explain policies, explain work methods, and explain work style. The numbers of tasks and deadlines are only given in general terms and not rigidly stipulated. The main emphasis is on ideological education, emphasizing mastering policies, and emphasizing taking the mass line. The leadership also paid attention to considering from all aspects to solve the difficulties in the work of the lower levels. The work plan should be discussed democratically by everyone, and opinions and difficulties should be put forward so that the plan is realistic. For example, in the spring production plan of Zhucheng County, the original determination was to focus on the fifth, thirteenth, and sixteenth districts for well digging. After everyone's discussion, the cadres of the thirteenth district proposed that only two townships in their area have the conditions for well digging, and the fifth district has quicksand and cannot be used as a key well digging area. If it is not corrected, it will inevitably cause the lower levels to coerce and command. Some districts proposed that their area has the conditions for well digging and a work foundation, which can be used as a key well digging area. The county party committee revised it according to everyone's opinions, and the plan became more realistic, which enabled the lower levels to have a way to complete it. 2. Specifically help district and township cadres study and improve work methods. First, the leading cadres made reports to establish correct standards, and then led everyone to conduct seminars and discussions in conjunction with local examples. Some counties also organized cadres to specifically study the working methods of model township head Li Ruilan in taking the mass line. In this way, the cadres were armed ideologically and stylistically.

Through the above practices, on the one hand, bureaucracy in leadership and commandism in grass-roots organizations were opposed; on the other hand, positive education was carried out, correct standards were established, and the work style of the mass line was implemented. Through these meetings, the leadership was both inspected and improved, and the cadres were both educated and improved, and the work was smoothly implemented. The cadres attending the meeting in each county felt that this meeting was very helpful to their education. Some said: "This is the first time I have attended such a meeting since I became a cadre." "I used to think that a little problem didn't matter, but coming to this meeting is like preventing disease before it happens." Everyone generally reflected: "This time the work deployment is specific, and there are also methods. We must never commit coercion and command again!" "I didn't know how to take the mass line before, but after this meeting, I have found the way. I should have done it this way earlier. Who would have committed coercion and command?"

    山东诸城等五县在检查和布置当前工作中
    创造反官僚主义的好办法
    编者按：山东诸城等五县，由县委召集县、区、乡三级干部开会，正确地解决了反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的问题。这种作法是好的。他们不是专为反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪而开会的，而是为了检查过去工作，布置今后工作而开会，就在这个会中展开了反官僚主义等斗争，由县委先作深刻的自我检讨，引导区、乡干部向县、区提出批评，并广泛地开展了自我批评。会议不但批评了坏人坏事，又表扬了好人好事，使大家知道去掉命令主义之后如何工作。这样做，就团结教育了觉悟起来的广大干部。各地都可以这样做，而且做得愈有领导、有准备就愈好。
    【本报讯】山东胶州地区的诸城、五莲、藏马、胶南、胶河五县县委，在二月下旬至三月上旬，分别召开了一次县、区、乡三级干部大会，结合总结冬季工作布置春季工作，以批评与自我批评的整风方法，贯彻了反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，会议收到了良好的效果。各县，到会区、乡及县级干部多的有一千四百人，少的有七百七十六人。会议开始，首先是由各县县委通过冬季工作总结，联系具体事实，深刻检讨了领导上严重的官僚主义作风，检讨了由于领导上官僚主义而造成的部分区、乡干部的命令主义；批判了个别区、乡干部违法乱纪的行为，并从党的政策和群众利益出发分析了它的危害性和危险性。同时各县官僚主义、强迫命令严重的部门负责干部也在会上作了检讨。县委所检讨揭发的问题，使到会干部认识到存在三方面的问题的严重性和对党对人民的严重危害，从而提高了思想觉悟，在小组、大会讨论中尖锐地批评了领导上的官僚主义作风。县委没有认识到的许多问题和原来认为不关重要的问题都被提出来了。如胶南县有的区、乡干部批评县委说：“布置打井时，因为我区是山区，我们提出不能打井，但领导上不采纳这个意见，单纯追求数字，说打在沟里也行。结果在沟里打井，不能发挥作用，劳民伤财。”这反映了县委领导上也存在着严重的命令主义作风。胶南县十二区干部并从算打井劳民伤财的账中，分析批判了领导上的官僚主义、追求数字给予工作和给予群众的危害。这些批判深刻地教育了领导干部，教育了干部。
    另一方面，县委诚恳的自我批评和虚心听取下面的批评，启发教育了到会的干部，许多区、乡干部自动地检讨了自己的强迫命令，并大胆地大量地批评揭发了区、乡干部中的强迫命令和少数干部的违法乱纪行为。胶南县委检查了领导上的官僚主义作风后，下面干部反映：“我们才知道上面的官僚主义是造成下边命令主义的总根。县委检讨了，我们也得好好检讨。”“上级布置的任务都是对群众有利的，但由于我们在工作中强迫命令，把许多好事都办坏了。今后必须好好转变作风，下决心克服强迫命令。”诸城县织沟区委会组织委员王仁玉说：“我再不检讨就对不起党了。”他检讨了自己阻止婚姻自由和支持民兵打人的错误。藏马县有的乡干部说：“这次县委真下决心了，检讨中连根都拔出来了，咱也得好好检讨。对于区干部的问题也要大胆揭发，他们若给‘小鞋’穿，咱就上告县，县不行一直告到中央。”胶河县四区下坡乡乡长朱业本听了县委检讨后，沉痛地检讨自己打骂群众的错误，说：“这回我体会到上级党对干部不是一脚踢。只要大胆检讨，群众是会原谅的，我回去一定到乡代表会作彻底检讨。”该县四区草桥乡乡长吕茂青在大会上发言时说：“我几年来没敢说的话，今天我要说出来。”他具体揭发了该乡支部书记丁明文和区公安员陈焕斋奸污妇女、打骂群众等违法乱纪的事实（过去吕茂青曾因给他们提意见受到严重的打击报复）并尖锐地批评了县委、区委领导干部的官僚主义。同时检讨了自己假报工作成绩骗取区委表扬等错误，表示决心改正。各县并选择作风恶劣的干部，组织大会检讨，有的县并结合处理了坏人坏事，更加深入了反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争。
    各县会议上所揭发出来的问题是极端严重的。例如藏马县揭露了乱打人的：一九五一年有一百四十名，一九五二年有九十一名，其中乡干部二百零八人，区干部二十三人；同时揭发出比较突出的案件二十五起。检查揭发出这些严重情况后，进一步教育了领导干部，惊醒了到会干部，使大家深刻地体会了官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪对党对人民的危害和展开这一斗争的重要意义。大家说：“再不反就有亡头的危险。”从而清除了个人主义的各种顾虑，树立了正确态度。大家表示：坚决转变作风，并积极领导开展反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争。
    在批判了强迫命令非群众路线的作风之后，因为正确的作风标准尚未树立，就有许多干部反映：
    “强迫命令不对，群众路线还不会，今后工作不好做了。”都迫切要求领导上教给办法。各县根据这一情况，都适时地选择了一批具有民主作风的、善于走群众路线的干部，让他们在大会上作典型介绍，进行教育。胶南县即在会上介绍了十九个典型。如六区河西乡支部书记唐进颜同志经常领导乡政府召开乡人民代表会议，发扬民主，有事就和群众商量，因此各种工作任务都完成得很好。胶河县区武装干事介绍了他如何采用耐心说服的方法，做好了普训民兵并建立基干团的工作。藏马县也介绍了李论长走群众路线，巩固和提高了互助组的典型事例。通过典型介绍，树立了正确作风的标准，教育了到会干部，同时也清除了少数干部认为“干工作就犯强迫命令，不干工作，就不会犯强迫命令”“对上负责就不能对群众负责”的错误认识。大家体会到：“只要有事和群众商量，什么工作也能作好。”
    这些县召开的三级干部会议在提高思想、整顿作风的基础上，布置了春季生产工作。在布置时，即注意了以下两个问题：一、布置工作从实际出发，交代任务，交代政策，交代工作方法，交代作风。任务数字、限期只作大体交代不作硬性规定，主要是强调思想教育，强调掌握政策，强调走群众路线。领导方面又注意从各方面考虑解决下面进行工作中的困难。工作计划让大家民主讨论，提出意见，提出困难，使计划切合实际。如诸城县春季生产计划中，打井一项，原确定以五、十三、十六三个区为重点，经过大家讨论后，十三区的干部提出他们那里只有两个乡有打井条件，五区则有流沙，不能作为打井重点区，如不纠正，势必造成下面强迫命令。有的区则提出：他们那里有打井条件，工作有基础，可作为打井重点区。县委即根据大家意见作了修正，计划就更加切合实际，就能使下面有办法完成。二、具体帮助区、乡干部研究改进工作方法。先由领导干部作报告树立正确的标准，然后领导大家结合当地典型进行座谈、讨论。有的县并组织干部专门学习了模范乡长李瑞兰走群众路线的工作方法。这样，从思想上作风上武装了干部。
    通过以上做法，一方面反对了领导上的官僚主义和基层组织中的命令主义；一方面从正面进行了教育，树立了正确的标准，贯彻了群众路线的作风。通过这些会议，既检查改进了领导，又教育提高了干部，并顺利地贯彻了工作。各县到会干部都感到这次会议对自己教育帮助很大。有的说：“我当干部以来头一次开这样的会。”“过去认为有点小毛病算不了什么，这次来开会等于无病先预防。”大家普遍反映：“这次工作布置的具体了，也有了办法，决不能再犯强迫命令了！”“以前不知道怎样才算走群众路线，这次开过会之后摸上门路了；早知道应该这么办好，谁还去犯强迫命令呢？”
