Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, April 19th (TASS dispatch): According to reports in the "Nirooye Sevom" and "Today's East" newspapers on the 18th, local authorities in Shiraz – the governor, the police chief, and the Shiraz division command – organized a conspiracy against the central Iranian government.

According to the "Nirooye Sevom" newspaper, a large rally was held in Shiraz on the 15th. Speakers at the rally either supported the Mossadegh government or opposed it. Subsequently, local authorities created disturbances in the city and attempted to spread the unrest to the territories inhabited by nearby tribal peoples. According to the newspaper, the conspirators' plans also included killing several Americans from the local branch of the "Truman's Point Four Program" implementing agency. The newspaper said that they wanted to blame the murder of the Americans on "leftists" in order to create a pretext for foreign intervention. The newspaper reported that the Americans had fled from the American implementing agency's building, which was destroyed on the evening of April 15th. In Shiraz, gunfire and disturbances continued until the morning of the 16th. A total of two people died, and about seventy were injured.

According to Tehran evening newspapers on the 18th, the Mossadegh government, on the 17th, sent its newly appointed Shiraz governor, police chief, and Shiraz division commander by plane from Tehran to Shiraz. "Today's East" wrote that the incidents that occurred in Shiraz, which could have dangerous consequences, were the result of incitement by foreign lackeys.

    企图造成帝国主义干涉的口实
    帝国主义走狗在伊朗制造事件
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社德黑兰十九日电：据十八日“尼路埃·塞佛姆报”和“今日东方报”报道，设刺子地方当局——省长、警察局长、设刺子师司令部——组织了反对伊朗中央政府的阴谋。
    据“尼路埃·塞佛姆报”报道，十五日，设刺子举行了大集会，在会上发言的人有的支持摩萨台政府，有的反对摩萨台政府，随后地方当局就在城市中造成骚乱，并企图把骚乱情况扩大到附近部落民族居住的领土上。据报纸报道，在阴谋者的计划中，也包括要杀死“杜鲁门第四点计划”执行机构地方分支机构的若干美国人。报纸说：他们想把杀害美国人一事嫁祸给“左翼分子”，以造成外国干涉的口实。据报纸报道，美国人曾从美国执行机构的大楼逃走，这所大楼在四月十五日晚间被毁了。在设刺子，枪声和骚乱情况一直继续到十六日清晨。共有两人死亡，约有七十人受伤。
    据德黑兰十八日的晚报报道，摩萨台政府在十七日把他新委任的设剌子省长、警察局长和设剌子师司令用飞机从德黑兰送到设剌子。“今日东方报”写道：设剌子发生可能有危险后果的事件，是外国走狗煽动的结果。
