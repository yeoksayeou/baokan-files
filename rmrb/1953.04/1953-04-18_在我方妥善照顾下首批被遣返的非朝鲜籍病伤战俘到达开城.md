Xinhua News Agency, Biktong, April 17th: This reporter reports: A convoy of non-Korean sick and wounded POWs, including twenty trucks, departed from here on the 15th and will arrive in Kaesong on the afternoon of the 17th. In order to make their three-day journey as comfortable as possible under wartime conditions, busy preparations were made here.

No more than twenty-four hours after the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded POWs was signed on April 11, sick and wounded POWs had already arrived at the concentration station set up in a valley near Biktong from some POW camps hundreds of miles away, or were on their way to the concentration station. The lightly ill and injured POWs, after having their hair cut, shaved, and bathed at the concentration station, walked around happily in the bright sunshine wearing neat blue uniforms and blue cotton overcoats.

The Chinese doctors and nurses accompanying the convoy have made full preparations to cope with any unexpected events that may occur on the road. Medicines, new thick cotton quilts and blankets were placed in the medical vehicle, which was covered with red squares and flags. All vehicles have been thoroughly overhauled for long-distance travel. Two supply trucks were also equipped, following behind the medical vehicle. An American sergeant's conversation precisely captured a common feeling: "We are fully prepared to cope with the weather and the rugged mountains of Korea. I hope Uncle Sam's pilots abide by the agreement and do not disrupt our southward journey."

The sick and wounded POWs have good food prepared for them during the long journey. Doctors and nurses check their health every day.

Under the large banners reading "You are going back to your loved ones and your hometown, I wish you a pleasant journey" and "Wish you good health," the POWs said goodbye and expressed their gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Many POWs who were staying here until the armistice also came to see off their comrades. The club with ping-pong, cards, chess and other recreational items was half empty. The POWs talked about when everyone could go home.

The POWs who were leaving expressed their gratitude for the medical care they received in the POW camps, which saved many lives and gradually restored their health. A POW leaning on a wall with crutches told me in detail how he was seriously injured near Panmunjom last October, and how he thought he would be shot at any time when he was captured. However, he was instead sent to a field hospital by his captors, and then transferred to a POW camp hospital, where he quickly underwent surgery. He is now able to walk around freely with crutches.

The healthy POWs who had to stay here and those who were leaving all said goodbye, "Don't forget us. When you go back, find a way to end this war sooner."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 17th: The first batch of non-Korean sick and wounded POWs to be repatriated arrived in Kaesong on the afternoon of the 17th. These non-Korean sick and wounded POWs were wearing warm and clean coats and overcoats, and smiled as they got out of the car. Except for a very few who needed stretchers, most of them walked very lightly.

The POWs arrived at the hospital set up for them in the original museum at 5 p.m. The terrain here is very high, and you can see the surrounding ruins caused by the indiscriminate bombing by American planes. In the south, a church has been bombed, leaving only the broken bell tower standing. After the POWs arrived, they were led into the sickrooms in the hall, where the beds were covered with mattresses and white sheets, and covered with cotton quilts, white sheets, and new blankets they received in the prisoner-of-war camp. After washing their faces and resting here for a while, they went to the dining hall of a school in the east to have dinner. Patients who were unable to move were brought their meals to their beds.

During the three-day journey, the convoy passed through one peaceful town after another that had been reduced to ruins by the indiscriminate bombing by American planes, but these POWs have always received thoughtful care. When the journey ended, an American prisoner said: "We have received really good care along the way, and everyone is in high spirits."

### 在我方妥善照顾下首批被遣返的非朝鲜籍病伤战俘到达开城

    在我方妥善照顾下首批被遣返的非朝鲜籍病伤战俘到达开城
    【新华社碧潼十七日电】本社特派记者报道：包括二十辆卡车的非朝鲜籍病伤战俘的车队，十五日已从这里出发，将在十七日下午到达开城。为着使他们这三天的旅途在战时条件下能够尽可能地舒适，这里曾进行了忙碌的准备。
    在遣返病伤战俘的协定在四月十一日签字后不过二十四小时，就已经有病伤战俘从分散在几百里外的一些战俘营来到设在碧潼附近山谷里的集中站，或者是正在前来集中站的路上。轻病轻伤的战俘们在集中站理了发、刮了脸、洗了澡以后，就穿着整洁的蓝制服和蓝色的棉大衣，高高兴兴地在明朗的阳光下走来走去。
    随车队照护的中国医生和护士们，为应付在路上可能发生的任何意外作了充分的准备。药品、新的厚棉被和毯子都放在医疗车里，车上覆着红方块，插着红旗。所有车辆都为走长途作了彻底的检修。还配备了两辆供给卡车，随在医疗车后面。一个美国中士的谈话正说中了普遍的一种感想：“为应付天气和朝鲜的崎岖的山，我们是完全准备好了。但愿山姆叔叔的飞行员们遵守协定，不要扰乱我们南下的旅行。”
    病伤战俘有准备在长途旅行中吃的很好的伙食。医生和护士每天都给他们检查身体。
    在写着“你们要回到亲人和老家那里去了，祝你们一路顺风”、“祝你们健康”的大标语下，战俘们告了别，并向中国人民志愿军表示感谢。许多要留在这里直到停战的战俘也来给他们的伙伴送行。放着乒乓球、纸牌、棋具等娱乐用品的俱乐部是半空的。战俘们纷纷谈着什么时候才能大家都回家去。
    要走的战俘们对他们在战俘营得到的医疗表示感谢，这救了许多人的命，并使他们逐渐恢复健康。一个扶着拐杖靠墙站着的战俘详细地告诉我，去年十月他怎样在板门店附近受了重伤，被俘的时候他怎样以为随时都会挨枪毙。可是，他反而被俘掳他的人送到野战医院，然后又转到了战俘营医院，在那里很快地就动了手术。他现在能够扶着拐杖随便地走动了。
    不得不留在这里的健康的战俘和那些要走的战俘告别时都说：“不要忘了我们。你们回去，想办法让这个战争早点结束。”
    【新华社开城十七日电】第一批将予遣返的非朝鲜籍病伤战俘十七日下午到达开城。这些非朝鲜籍的病伤战俘穿着暖和清洁的外衣和大衣，下车时面露笑容，除了极少数需要担架的以外，大多数脚步都很轻快。
    战俘们下午五时到达为他们设置在原博物馆里的医院，这里地势很高，可以看见周围被美机滥炸造成的断壁残垣，在南边一座教堂已被炸毁，只剩下残破的钟楼矗立着。战俘们到达后，被引进设在大厅里的病室，这里床上铺着褥子、白褥单，盖的是棉被、白被单和他们在俘虏营领到的新毯子。他们在这里洗过脸休息一会以后，就到东边一所学校的饭厅里吃晚饭，不便行动的病人是把饭拿到床前来吃的。
    在三天的旅程中，车队通过了一个又一个在美机滥炸下成为废墟的和平城镇，但是这些战俘却一直都得到周到的照顾。当旅程结束的时候一个美俘说：“我们一路受到真是很好的照应，大家的情绪都很高。”
