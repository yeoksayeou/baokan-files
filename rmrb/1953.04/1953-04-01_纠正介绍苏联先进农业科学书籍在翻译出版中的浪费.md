    Correcting Waste in the Translation and Publication of Books Introducing Advanced Soviet Agricultural Science
    Yang Lanfang from Sichuan Rongchang Agricultural School writes: The number of books published domestically introducing advanced Soviet agricultural science is insufficient to meet objective needs. This is because translation and publishing resources are inadequate. However, there is serious waste in the translation and publication of these books, which is a problem worthy of attention. For example, "Michurin's Breeding Methods (Illustrated Explanation)" published by Zhonghua Book Company and "Michurin's Variety Improvement Method" published by Northeast Agricultural Publishing House are re-translations of the same book. Before Zhonghua Book Company published Davidov's "Michurin's Doctrine of Livestock Breeding," there was already the Northeast version of the same book, "Michurin's Doctrine of Breeding New Breeds of Animals," and the 1950s version of "On Breeding New Breeds of Livestock According to Michurin's Doctrine." The Northeast version of "Michurin's Method of Breeding New Breeds of Agricultural Livestock" and "The Creation of New Animals" published by Zhonghua Book Company; the Commercial Press version of "Biological Science Today" and "Biological Science in the New Era" published by Zhonghua Book Company... are also all re-translations. Some of the later published translations are not better than the earlier published ones; and the translations have different titles, so readers cannot tell whether they are the same book, and often buy duplicates. Currently, our translation resources are not excessive, but insufficient. This waste should no longer exist. It is hoped that the publishing administrative authorities will find a way to correct this. In addition, in the Soviet Agricultural Science Series edited by the Compilation Committee of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, "Agricultural Technology of Grassland Afforestation" (No. 7) and "The Theory and Achievements of Williams' Doctrine" (No. 16) both repeat nearly half of their content, reprinting Lysenko's "Undergrowth Planting of Shelter Forest Belts" and "The Decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of April 1950 on Planting Shelter Forest Belts." The former is a re-translation of an article, and the latter is a repeated publication of a translation. This kind of waste should not occur within one publishing organization's series.

### 纠正介绍苏联先进农业科学书籍在翻译出版中的浪费

专栏：读者来信摘要

    纠正介绍苏联先进农业科学书籍在翻译出版中的浪费
    四川荣昌农业学校杨兰芳来信：现在国内出版的介绍苏联先进农业科学的书籍是不足客观需要的，这是因为翻译力量和出版力量不足；但这类书籍的翻译、出版工作中又有着严重的浪费现象，这是一个值得重视的问题。如中华书局出版的“米邱林育种方法（图表说明）”和东北农业出版社的“米邱林的品种改良法”两书是一书的重译；中华书局出版的道维多夫的“米邱林学说的家畜育种”出版前已有了同书的东北版“繁殖动物新品种的米邱林学说”和五十年代版“关于育成家畜新品种的米邱林学说”；东北版的“育成农业牲畜新品种的米邱林方法”和中华书局出版的“新动物的创造”；商务版的“今日的生物科学”和中华书局出版的“新时代的生物科学”……也都是重译本。这些书籍中有些后出版的译本并不比先出版的译本好；而且两种译本的译名不一，读者无从辨明是否一书，常常买重。目前我们的翻译力量不是过多，而是不足，这种浪费现象不应该再存在下去了，希望出版行政机关设法纠正。此外，华北农业科学研究所编译委员会主编的苏联农业科学丛书中，“草原造林的农业技术”（第七号）和“威廉士学说的理论及其成就”（第十六号）两书都以几乎一半的篇幅重复载出李森科的“护田森林带底丛式播种”和“苏联部长会议和联共（布）中央委员会一九五○年四月关于种植护田森林带的决议”，前者是一文重译，后者是一种译文重复刊载。这种浪费现象出现在一个出版机关的一种丛书内更是不应该的。
