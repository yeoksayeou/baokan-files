Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion on April 21st regarding Burma's complaint against the Kuomintang bandit gang's aggression.

    During the morning session, the Argentinian delegation put forward a new proposal requesting the Burmese government, the Taiwan Kuomintang government, and other "directly related governments" to hold negotiations in order to immediately withdraw the relevant troops, thereby resolving the various issues. The proposal requested the Burmese government to report the results of the negotiations to the next General Assembly.

    The Dutch and Greek representatives expressed sympathy for the Argentinian proposal.

    The next speaker, Pakistani representative Bokhari, expressed extreme sympathy for Burma. Bokhari said that the Argentinian proposal was inappropriate because any proposal passed by the General Assembly should at least condemn these troops illegally stationed in Burma.

    U.S. Representative Lodge suggested that the solution should first involve the Chiang Kai-shek authorities agreeing in principle to try to "influence" the Kuomintang military headquarters in Burma, which could lead to a cessation of hostilities and then cause these troops to lay down their arms and withdraw from Burma. At the same time, Lodge pointed out that a complete withdrawal was probably impossible. He suggested that the most likely outcome was the withdrawal of a "substantial number" of these troops. Lodge opposed submitting the issue to the Security Council. He expressed interest in the Argentinian proposal.

    The Australian representative echoed the U.S. position, requesting the Burmese delegation to withdraw its request for the Security Council to take action.

    French Representative Hoppenot expressed the same attitude, saying that France would support a proposal for reconciliation.

    In the afternoon session, Belarusian representative Kiselev pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek clique not only commanded Li Mi's bandit gang to invade Burmese territory but also transported equipment and supplies to them through the Thai border. Kiselev concluded by saying that he would vote in favor of Burma's proposal.

    During the session, the Mexican delegation distributed a new proposal to the representatives, suggesting that the "foreign troops" within Burma be immediately disarmed and subsequently detained or withdrawn, but this suggestion did not mention the connection between these troops and the Taiwan Kuomintang clique.

    Representatives from Arab countries, Belarus, and Ukraine strongly supported Burma and demanded that the General Assembly take effective steps to stop the aggression against Burma.

    Ukrainian representative Baranovksy emphasized that the General Assembly could not remain silent about the threat to peace caused by the Kuomintang's aggression. Baranovksy concluded by saying that he would vote in favor of the Burmese government's proposal.

    The Indonesian representative said he would support Burma's proposal. Representatives from Afghanistan, Syria, and Lebanon also called for effective solidarity with the Burmese government.

    联大政委会继续讨论缅甸控诉国民党匪帮侵略案
    白俄罗斯和乌克兰代表发言支持缅甸提案
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：联合国大会政治委员会四月二十一日继续讨论缅甸控诉国民党匪帮侵略案。
    在上午的会议上，阿根廷代表团提出了一项新的提案，要求缅甸政府和台湾国民党政府以及其他“直接有关政府”举行谈判，以求立即撤退有关的军队，从而解决各项问题。该提案要求缅甸政府就谈判结果向下届大会提出报告。
    荷兰与希腊代表对阿根廷的提案表示同情。
    继起发言的巴基斯坦代表鲍哈里对缅甸表示极度同情。鲍哈里说，阿根廷的提案是不适宜的，因为任何大会通过的提案至少应该对这些非法驻在缅甸的军队加以责备。
    美国代表洛奇建议说，解决办法首先要蒋介石当局在原则上同意设法“影响”在缅甸的国民党军队司令部，这样便可导致战事的停止，然后使这些军队放下武器，撤离缅甸。同时洛奇指出，完全撤退恐怕是办不到的。他建议说，预期最大的可能是撤退这些军队“数目相当大”的一部分。洛奇反对把这个问题提交安全理事会。他对阿根廷提案表示有兴趣。
    澳大利亚代表响应美国的立场，他请求缅甸代表团撤回它要安全理事会采取行动的要求。
    法国代表奥培诺表示同样的态度，奥培诺说，法国将支持和解的建议。
    在下午的会议上，白俄罗斯代表基谢列夫指出：蒋介石集团不仅指挥李弥匪帮侵略缅甸领土，而且还通过泰国国境给他们运送装备和供应。基谢列夫最后说：他将投票赞成缅甸的提案。
    在会议进行期间，墨西哥代表团把它提出的一项新提案散发给各位代表，这项提案建议要求立即把缅甸境内的“外国军队”解除武装，随后予以拘禁或撤退，但是这个建议并未谈到这些军队与台湾国民党集团的联系。
    阿拉伯国家、白俄罗斯和乌克兰的代表们都竭力支持缅甸，并要求大会采取有效步骤制止对缅甸的侵略。
    乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基强调指出：大会不能对国民党的侵略所引起的对和平的威胁默不作声。巴拉诺夫斯基最后说，他将投票赞成缅甸政府的提案。
    印度尼西亚代表说他将支持缅甸的提案。阿富汗、叙利亚和黎巴嫩的代表也都要求对缅甸政府作有效的声援。
