(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow) According to TASS, the ceremony for awarding the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize to Reverend Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the National Council of the Canadian Peace Congress, a renowned public figure, and Doctor of Theology, was held in Moscow on March 28.

Participants in the ceremony warmly welcomed the heroic peace fighter, known for his resolute opposition to imperialist aggression against Korea and his defense of world peace.  Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize Committee, praised Wen Youzhang's contribution to the cause of peace in a brief speech, and awarded the certificate and gold medal to Wen Youzhang amidst enthusiastic applause. Subsequently, Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, Kluticha, a representative of Soviet women and youth, and Nikolai, Archbishop of the Kolomna Diocese, delivered speeches, congratulating Wen Youzhang and expressing hope for his continued success in the noble work of defending peace.

In his reply, Wen Youzhang stated that receiving the Stalin International Peace Prize was his greatest honor. He said that Stalin's death had made all thoughtful people in all countries think about the responsibility we should bear today to maintain world peace. He continued: The men and women who were able to defend Leningrad and Stalingrad, who drove the Nazi invaders out of their homeland, and who rebuilt all the destroyed cities with amazing speed, grew up in the social system established by the lifelong struggle and leadership of Lenin and Stalin, and their names will be immortal. We can believe that the Soviet people who overthrew the heinous Nazi forces can defend peace just as heroically today.

Wen Youzhang said that in Western countries, only a small handful of powerful people are advocating for war. The majority of the Canadian people—and I believe the majority of the American people as well—sincerely hope for peace.  They have the World Peace Movement on a grand scale as an allied force, so they are not isolated and are powerful.

Wen Youzhang then spoke about the Korean War. He expressed that the Canadian Peace Congress wholeheartedly supports the proposal of the World People's Peace Congress for an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

Wen Youzhang concluded: I have come to the conclusion that the peace movement is the most universal and effective people's movement in history. This movement knows no national boundaries, and it can become a decisive force in preventing another world war.

    文幼章在莫斯科接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予加拿大和平大会全国理事会主席、著名公众领袖、神学博士文幼章牧师的典礼，三月二十八日在莫斯科举行。
    参加典礼的人都热烈欢迎这位以坚决反对帝国主义侵略朝鲜和维护世界和平而闻名的英勇的和平战士。“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席斯科贝尔琴在简短的演说中赞扬了文幼章对和平事业的贡献，并在全场欢呼声中把奖状和金质奖章授予文幼章。接着，苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫、苏联妇女和青年代表克卢提柴与科罗姆纳教区大主教尼古拉先后发表演说，他们都向文幼章祝贺，并希望他在保卫和平的崇高工作中继续获得成功。
    文幼章在他的答词中表示，他能够获得斯大林国际和平奖金，是他的最大的光荣。他说，斯大林的逝世，使所有国家有思想的人都想到我们今天应该负起的维护世界和平的责任。他接着说：那些能够保卫列宁格勒和斯大林格勒、能够把纳粹侵略者赶出自己的国土、能够以惊人的速度重建所有被毁的城市的男女，都是在列宁与斯大林毕生的斗争和领导所建立起来的社会制度中生长起来的，他们两人的名字将永垂不朽。我们可以相信推翻了万恶纳粹势力的苏联人民，今天能同样英勇地保卫和平。
    文幼章说：在西方国家，只有一小撮有权势的人鼓吹战争。加拿大大多数人民——我相信美国大多数人民也是这样——都很真诚地希望和平。他们有伟大的世界规模的和平运动这样一支同盟军，他们就不孤立而且有力量了。
    文幼章接着谈到朝鲜战争。他表示加拿大和平大会衷心拥护世界人民和平大会关于立即在朝鲜停战的主张。
    文幼章最后说：我已经得出一个结论，就是：和平运动是历史上最普遍的和最有效的人民运动，这种运动没有国家界线，它能够成为防止发生另一次大战的决定性的力量。
