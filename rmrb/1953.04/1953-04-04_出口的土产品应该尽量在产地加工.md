Exported Native Products Should Be Processed in the Place of Origin as Much as Possible
Zhang Bingqian Zheng Shufeng

    Many of China's exported native products are transported as raw or semi-finished goods to port locations, where they are processed and prepared for export. This practice is highly unreasonable. We suggest that exported native products should be processed in the place of origin as much as possible, manufactured into finished products according to export specifications, and packaged according to the prescribed standards before being transported to the port for inspection and export.

    These two methods result in significant differences in commodity costs. For example, a large portion of Hebei Province's peanuts, aside from those consumed within the province and sold domestically, are transported to Tianjin or Qinhuangdao for processing and export, while the by-products are transported back to the interior for sale. For instance, if 10,000 tons of raw peanuts are transported to Tianjin for processing, generally only 8,000 tons of Grade A standard export peanuts are obtained. The remaining 2,000 tons of "oil peanuts" must be further processed for oil extraction, with part of the oil and all of the peanut cake being transported back to the place of origin for sale. If we were to process these 10,000 tons of peanuts into 8,000 tons of Grade A standard peanuts in the place of origin and transport them to Tianjin for export, and extract oil from the 2,000 tons of "oil peanuts" locally, we could save a lot of money and speed up capital turnover. What is the actual loss caused by transporting these 10,000 tons of peanuts to Tianjin for processing and export?

    First, let's consider transportation and miscellaneous expenses. The 2,000 tons of "oil peanuts" mixed in with the 10,000 tons of raw peanuts, which cannot be exported, require 22,222 packages. A 30-ton railway car usually only carries 329 packages, requiring 68 railway cars. If transported from Zhengding to Tianjin, the freight cost per car is 2.67 million yuan, totaling 181.56 million yuan for 68 cars; loading and unloading fees in both locations are 360,000 yuan per car, totaling 24.48 million yuan; with a transportation loss of 0.7%, 14 tons are consumed, valued at 56 million yuan; these items alone result in a loss of 262.04 million yuan.

    Next, let's consider processing costs. According to a survey by Hebei Province's Oil and Fat Company, the average processing cost per ton of peanuts in Tianjin, including management fees, is 8,000 yuan higher than in the interior. Therefore, 10,000 tons of goods require an additional 80 million yuan. The cost of processing for oil extraction is similar to that in the interior. From 2,000 tons of oil peanuts, 720 tons of peanut oil and 1,260 tons of peanut cake can be produced. Assuming half of the oil products (assuming half are sold or exported in Tianjin) and all of the peanut cake are transported back to the place of origin, the oil requires 14 cars (143 barrels per car), and the peanut cake requires 43 cars (420 packages per car, 140 jin per package). If the freight cost per car is calculated at 2.67 million yuan, the total freight cost is 152.19 million yuan; transportation loss (0.25% for oil, 0.5% for peanut cake) is valued at 18 million yuan; in total, the additional processing costs and material return transport result in a loss of 250.19 million yuan.

    The total direct loss from the above two items amounts to 512.23 million yuan. The losses due to delayed capital turnover, interest on loans, packaging depreciation, personnel waste, and the increased management costs resulting from this are not even included in this calculation. This figure is staggering. The benefits of processing native products in the place of origin are not limited to this. It can also completely eliminate the past phenomenon of port processing plants stopping work to wait for materials or having excessive inventory. For example, oil processing plants in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao often experience work stoppages or excessive inventory due to the seasonal nature of commodities and scattered purchases, often causing the state to incur many unnecessary expenses or immobilize hundreds of millions of yuan in capital. If processing can be dispersed in the place of origin to adapt to the commodity season, this loss can be avoided. At the same time, it can also support the production of certain factories (such as oil mills) in small and medium-sized cities.

    In summary, processing native products in the place of origin can save a lot of money, speed up capital turnover, and support the processing industries of small and medium-sized cities; and relatively reduce seasonal production in port cities, and reduce the large-scale flow of labor. Hebei Province's Oil and Fat Company has begun to pay attention to this issue. Facts have proven that it is entirely possible to process native products in the place of origin, pack them into standard packages, stamp them with a certain prescribed mark, and transport them directly to the port for export. We suggest that state-owned enterprise companies engaged in the export of native products actively promote this approach.

    出口的土产品应该尽量在产地加工
    张秉谦　郑树锋
    我国出口的土产品，许多是把毛货或半成品运到口岸地点，加工整理后，再行出口。这样做是很不合理的。我们建议出口的土产品尽量在产地加工，按照出口规格制成成品，并按照规定的标准包装好，然后再运到口岸检验出口。
    这两种办法会在商品成本上造成很大的差别。例如，河北省的花生，除去省内消费和运销国内各地以外，还有很大一批要运到天津或秦皇岛加工出口，但其副产品却要运回内地销售。譬如说，一万吨毛货花生米运到天津加工，一般只能得到八千吨合乎出口规格的甲种大路花生米；剩下两千吨“油料花生米”，须再加工榨油，部分成油和全部花生饼还要运回产地销售。如果我们就在原产地把这一万吨花生米加工成八千吨甲种大路花生米运到天津出口，把两千吨“油料花生米”在当地榨油，就可以节省许多费用，并且能加速资金周转。这一万吨花生米如果运到天津加工出口，究竟能造成多大损失呢？
    先说运杂费。一万吨毛货花生米中夹杂着的两千吨不能出口的“油料花生米”，要装二万二千二百二十二包，一辆三十吨的车皮通常只装三百二十九包，即需六十八辆车皮。如从正定运到天津，每车花生米运费是二百六十七万元，六十八车就要一亿八千一百五十六万元；两地装卸费每车三十六万元，共需二千四百四十八万元；以运输损耗千分之七计算，要消耗十四吨，折价五千六百万元；这几项就损失二亿六千二百零四万元。
    再说加工费用。根据河北省油脂公司的调查，天津每吨花生米的加工费用，包括管理费用在内，平均要比内地高八千元，一万吨货即须多花八千万元。加工榨油费用与内地相仿。两千吨油料花生米可榨花生油七百二十吨，产花生饼一千二百六十吨；照半数油品（假定半数留天津销售或出口）和全部花生饼运回产地计算，油需装十四车（每车一四三桶），油饼需装四十三车（每车四二○包，每包一四○斤），如每车运费按二百六十七万元计算，共需运费一亿五千二百一十九万元；运输损耗（油千分之二点五，油饼千分之五）折价一千八百万元；综计加工多付和物资返运共损失二亿五千零一十九万元。
    以上两项直接损失共达五亿一千二百二十三万元。至于因延迟资金周转、货款利息、包装折旧、人员浪费和由此而增加的管理费用等损失，还未计算在内。这个数字是惊人的。把土产品在产地进行加工的好处还不止此。它还可以彻底消灭口岸加工厂过去停工待料或积货过多的现象。例如天津、秦皇岛两地的油料加工厂，因为商品的季节性较大，收购零散等原因，经常发生停工待料或积货过多的现象，往往使国家增加很多无谓的开支或积压数百亿元资金。如果能分散在产地适应商品的季节进行加工，便可避免这种损失。同时，还可以扶植中小城市某些工厂（如油坊）的生产。
    总起来说，土产品在产地加以可以节省大量费用，可以加速资金周转，可以扶助中小城市的加工工业；并相对地减少口岸城市季节性的生产，减少劳动力的大量流动。河北省油脂公司已开始注意这个问题。事实证明：把土产品在产地加工，打成标准包装，盖上一定规定的嚜头，直接运到口岸出口，是完全可能的。我们建议经营土产出口的国营企业公司积极推行这个办法。
