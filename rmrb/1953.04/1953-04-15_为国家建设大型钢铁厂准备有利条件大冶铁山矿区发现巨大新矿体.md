    Favorable Conditions Prepared for National Construction of Large-Scale Steel Plant: Discovery of a Huge New Ore Body in the Daye Tieshan Mining Area
    [Xinhua News Agency] A huge new magnetite ore body has been discovered in the famous Daye Tieshan Mining Area. This discovery was confirmed by the 429 Geological Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government at 2:00 AM on April 3rd after three months of drilling. The Tieshan Mining Area originally had two huge ore bodies. Now, this newly discovered ore body connects the original two ore bodies, bringing a new evaluation to the iron ore reserves of the Tieshan Mining Area. It will reduce the cost of large-scale mining in the future, preparing very favorable resource conditions for China's new large-scale steel plants.
    The location of this new ore body in the Daye Tieshan Mining Area – Jianlin Mountain – was previously surveyed by geologists from imperialist countries such as France, Britain, the United States, and Japan between 1905 and 1913 with the intention of plundering China's treasures. From 1917 to 1946, a group of Chinese geologists with bourgeois geological viewpoints also conducted investigations. However, they all believed that the long gap between the two originally discovered ore bodies was an incomprehensible "fault." In 1936, Chinese geologists such as Sun Jianchu estimated that there was ore here and suggested drilling, but this suggestion was shelved due to the corruption and incompetence of the Kuomintang reactionary government. It was not until after liberation, in 1951, that the physical exploration team of New China arrived. They used advanced Soviet experience to conduct exploration and determined several boreholes based on preliminary work results. Drilling work began in the winter of the same year. However, due to the use of American-style drilling rigs at that time, the drilling efficiency was very low, and it was impossible to complete the drilling task in the hard and deep rock formations. In the summer of 1952, Soviet geological expert Krotki braved the scorching heat to reach the area to help solve the problem of resource exploration in the Tieshan Mining Area. After careful research, he suggested that deep drilling must be carried out in the area, combining the results of physical exploration and geological work. The 429 Geological Exploration Team accepted this valuable suggestion. Starting from last summer, they diligently completed physical exploration and geological survey work, accurately determining the boreholes through autumn and the severe winter. Last winter, several Soviet drilling rigs simultaneously started operating on this so-called incomprehensible "fault." In just three months since drilling began, two months ahead of schedule, the No. 28 drilling rig discovered a high-quality magnetite ore body at a depth of 223.05 meters and an elevation of minus 10 meters.

    为国家建设大型钢铁厂准备有利条件大冶铁山矿区发现巨大新矿体
    【新华社讯】全国著名的大冶铁山矿区发现了一个巨大的磁铁矿新矿体。这个发现是中央人民政府地质部四二九地质勘探队，经过三个月的钻探后，在四月三日早晨二时证实的。铁山矿区原来有两个巨大的矿体，现在这个新发现的矿体就把原来的两个矿体连接起来，给铁山矿区的铁矿储量带来了新的评价；它将使今后大规模开采时的成本降低，为我国新建大型钢铁厂准备了很有利的资源条件。
    大冶铁山矿区这个新矿体的所在地——尖林山，早在一九零五年到一九一三年间，就有法、英、美、日等帝国主义国家的地质学家们，怀着掠夺我国宝藏的企图先后来勘测过；一九一七年到一九四六年间也曾有一批抱着资产阶级地质学的观点的中国地质学者们作过调查，但是他们都认为在这原来已发现的两个矿体之间的一段漫长的空隙地带，是一个不可理解的“断层”。一九三六年，我国的地质学家孙健初等人虽然曾经估计这里有矿，建议进行钻探，但是当时由于国民党反动政府的腐败无能，这一建议一直被搁置下来了。直到解放以后，一九五一年，新中国的物理探矿队来了，他们采用苏联先进经验进行探测，并根据初步工作结果确定了几个钻孔。同年冬季，开始了钻探工作。但是由于那时使用的是美国式的钻机，钻进效率很低，没法在坚硬而深厚的岩层里完成钻探任务。一九五二年夏季，苏联地质专家克罗特基为了帮助解决铁山矿区的资源勘探问题，曾经冒着炎暑到达该地。经过仔细研究以后，他建议必须结合物理探矿和地质工作的成果，在该地进行深部钻探。四二九地质勘探队接受了这一宝贵的建议，他们从去年夏季开始，经过了秋天和严寒的冬天，终于辛勤地完成了物理探矿和地质勘查等工作，准确地确定了钻孔。去年冬季，几部苏联钻机就同时在这段所谓不可理解的“断层”上开动起来了。开钻到现在不过三个月时间，比预定时间提前了两个月，第二十八号钻机就在钻深二百二十三点零五公尺、海拔负十公尺处发现了质量优良的磁铁矿矿体。
