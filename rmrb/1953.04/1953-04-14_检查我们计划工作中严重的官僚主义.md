    Inspecting Serious Bureaucracy in Our Planning Work
    Fu Shun Mining Bureau Planning Department
    For the past four years, the planning work of our Planning Department has been carried out behind closed doors, using plans detached from reality to lead production. It is hard to imagine what role such plans can play in production. Let us use the following facts to illustrate.
    I. Planning department personnel do not go deep into the workshops, and they have no idea what's going on. We know that the basis of operation and management of state-owned enterprises is quota management. Therefore, planning quotas must be scientific and average advanced quotas. However, for the past four years, our formulation of technical and economic quotas and consumption quotas has evolved from "estimation" to haggling based on "statistical quotas." As a result, the plans are inaccurate, and the plant and mine planning staff take advantage of us and exploit loopholes, and we have no way to deal with it. The Labor Planning Section of the Planning Department does not grasp labor quotas, and the planned targets are also calculated "roughly." The Production Planning Section has no data as a basis and determines targets by "haggling." Knowing that there is a problem, they can't say anything. For example, in the 1953 plan for coal for own use, the plan for Longfeng Mine is equivalent to 538 percent of that of Laohutai Mine, which is 21,250 tons more. This is obviously problematic, but we have no basis for obtaining the correct figures. Regarding capital construction, we have always decided on project items behind closed doors. In fact, for the past four years, we have not even known where the capital construction projects are located, let alone using the investment correctly. The leading cadres in the department have visited the plants and mines very few times in the past four years. Taking the head of the Statistics Section as an example, he has been working in the bureau for three years and still does not know where the open-pit mine is. From this, we can see the seriousness of our bureaucracy. The Planning Department usually does not grasp the data. When planning tasks come, it is busy handing in papers and filling out forms. Even if problems are found, it is excused by saying that "it is not a problem that can be solved in a short time, let's study it again after the plan is compiled." In fact, after the plan is completed, everything is fine, and the problems found when the plan was made have long been forgotten. This kind of work style is irresponsible to the country.
    II. Only making plans but not checking plans. The planning staff believes that all responsibilities have been completed after completing the plan and sending it to the relevant departments. They have never checked the implementation of the plan. When going to plants and mines to understand the situation, they only go to the planning section to find out how much the output has been completed, how much the cost has been reduced, and how much the labor efficiency has been improved. They just listen to what the planning section says and then "return fully loaded" to write summaries and reports. They rarely go deep into the workshops and teams to understand the actual situation. They believe that anyway, the principles have been stipulated, there are also explicit provisions, and arrangements have been made. Further research does not seem to be the responsibility of our planning department. Take the case of Jiang Bo, the former director of the machine repair factory, and Liu Shen, the deputy director, who violated laws and regulations for a long time. In the first half of 1952, we had already discovered problems in the financial costs of the factory, but we just called to ask why it had dropped so much. They said: This is because labor efficiency has improved, working hours have been shortened, and materials have been saved, so costs have been reduced. We felt very satisfied with such an answer and did not delve further. Subsequently, we found problems in the factory's quota management and went to the factory for inspection, but we did not come to a conclusion and let it go. If we could have gone deep into the workshop for inspection with a responsible attitude at that time, their deception could have been exposed and corrected earlier, and the country would have suffered less losses. The statistical work in the past three years has also been statistical work for the sake of reports, so it is impossible to play a role in checking plans.
    The above facts fully illustrate that our planning staff has a serious bureaucratic work style and an intolerable irresponsible attitude. The planning staff not only cannot play an advanced advisory role in enterprise management, but instead accommodates backward thinking. At the beginning of the large-scale national construction in 1953, we are determined to do the following:
    I. We must thoroughly examine the errors in our work, combine it with the struggle against "bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and regulations," criticize incorrect ideas, and change our work style.
    II. Establish a plan inspection system, go deep into workshops and teams, rely on the masses, discover problems, solve problems in a timely manner, and strengthen statistical analysis.
    III. Carry out criticism and self-criticism and strive to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced planning work experience.

    检查我们计划工作中严重的官僚主义
    抚顺矿务局计划处
    我们计划处四年来的计划工作一直是闭门造车，以脱离实际的计划领导生产，这种计划很难想像它对生产会起什么作用。让我们用以下几个事实来说明。
    一、计划部门人员不深入车间，心中无数。我们知道国营企业经营管理的基础就是定额管理。所以计划定额必须是科学的、平均先进的定额。但我们四年来制订技术经济定额、消耗定额，是从“估计”发展到按“统计定额”讨价还价，因此计划不准确，厂矿计划工作人员对我们打埋伏、钻空子，我们也没有办法。计划处劳动计划科不掌握人工定额，计划指标也是以“大概”来计算的。生产计划科没有资料作依据，以“讨价还价”来确定指标，明知有问题，嘴里说不出。如一九五三年计划的自用煤，龙凤矿的计划相当于老虎台矿的百分之五百三十八，多二万一千二百五十吨。这显然是有问题的，但我们没有一点根据来求得正确的数字。对于基本建设，我们也是一向闭门决定工程项目。实际上，四年来连基本建设工程在哪里，我们都不知道，当然更难说正确地使用投资了。处内领导干部四年来到厂矿去的次数寥寥可数，就以统计科长来说，在局工作三年，还不知道露天矿在哪里。从这里可以看出我们官僚主义的严重。计划处平时不掌握资料，计划任务一来，又忙交卷又忙填表，虽发现有问题，也是借口“不是一时能够解决的问题，计划编定再研究吧”而敷衍过去。事实上计划编完，万事大吉，订计划时所发现的问题早已遗忘。这种工作作风，是对国家不负责任的。
    二、只作计划而不检查计划。计划工作人员把计划编完，分别送到有关部门，就认为全部责任完成了，从来没有检查过计划执行的情况。平时到厂矿了解情况，也仅是到计划科了解一下产量完成多少，成本降低多少，劳动效率提高多少；只听计划科一说，就“满载而归”，动笔写总结、打报告；很少深入车间、班组了解一下实际情况。认为反正原则是规定了，也有明文，也有布置，进一步的研究好像已不是我们计划部门的责任。就拿机修厂前任厂长江波、副厂长刘燊等长期违法乱纪这件事来说，一九五二年上半年，我们从该厂的财务成本上已经发现有问题，但只是打电话问一下，为什么降低这么多。他们说：这是由于劳动效率提高，工时缩短了，并节省了材料，因而成本降低了，我们听了这样的回答，就觉得很满意了，就再未深追下去。继之，我们从该厂的定额管理上又发现有问题，到厂检查，没有得出究竟，也就算了。如果当时能以认真负责的态度深入车间检查一下，他们的欺上瞒下行为就能够及早揭穿和纠正，使国家少受许多损失。三年来的统计工作，也是为报表而统计，因而也谈不到起检查计划的作用。
    以上事实充分地说明了我们计划工作人员存在着严重的官僚主义作风和不能容忍的不负责任态度。计划工作人员不但不能对企业管理起到先进的参谋作用，反而迁就落后思想。在一九五三年国家大规模建设开始的时候，我们坚决要做到下面这几点：
    一、要深入检查工作中的错误，结合“反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪”斗争，批判不正确的思想，改变工作作风。
    二、建立检查计划制度，深入车间班组，依靠群众，发现问题，及时解决问题，加强统计分析。
    三、开展批评与自我批评，努力学习苏联的先进的计划工作经验。
