    Liaoxi 401 Factory

    Continues to Deepen Mass Discussion of Plans

    Since January, when Liaoxi Province's 401 Factory began formulating and discussing this year's production plan, it has achieved considerable success. Various workshops and groups have found many tricks, learned from advanced Soviet experience, and thus completed the production plans for January and February on schedule. However, in the previous period, the factory's leading cadres did not clearly recognize that the discussion of plans should be used to further strengthen planning management; the leadership methods were generalized, and no examples of advanced figures and advanced groups were established, so the work of discussing plans was also relatively generalized. Secondly, the shortcomings existing in planning management and other aspects were not thoroughly and deeply exposed, the potential of production was far from being fully utilized, there was no clear idea of ​​how great the potential of the entire factory was, and waste was still very serious. At the same time, the masses were not mobilized widely enough, and the results of planning discussions in the capital construction department, auxiliary workshops, and among ordinary workers were not significant; most departments and offices did not discuss in depth. Therefore, the factory decided to continue to deepen the mass discussion of plans, and through this discussion achieve the following three goals: First, to raise the awareness of employees, establish economic accounting thinking and a comprehensive planning perspective; Second, to launch a mass anti-waste movement, reduce consumption quotas, reduce costs, increase technical and economic quotas, increase equipment utilization rates, and formulate practical and feasible technical measures plans, and on this basis revise the plans of groups, workshops, and the entire factory; Third, to strengthen planning management, overcome blindness and chaos in production, and organize balanced production.

    辽西四○一厂
    继续深入发动群众讨论计划
    辽西省四○一厂从一月份开始制订与讨论今年生产计划以来，已收到不少成绩，各车间、小组，找到了许多窍门，学习了苏联先进经验，因此按时完成了一、二月份生产计划。但是在前一时期，该厂的领导干部没有明确要通过讨论计划来进一步加强计划管理；领导方法一般化，没有树立先进人物和先进小组的样子，所以讨论计划工作也比较一般化。其次，没有普遍深入地揭露计划管理等方面存在的缺点，生产潜力发挥得还很差，对全厂的潜力究竟多大心中无数，浪费现象仍很严重。同时，群众发动得不够普遍，基本建设部门、辅助车间和普通工人讨论计划的成绩不大；大多数科、室讨论得也不深入。因此该厂决定继续深入地发动群众讨论计划，通过这一讨论达到以下三个目的：一、提高职工觉悟，树立经济核算思想和全面计划观点；二、开展群众性的反浪费运动，降低消耗定额，降低成本，提高技术经济定额，提高设备运用率，订出切实可行的技术措施计划，在这个基础上修订小组、车间和全厂的计划；三、加强计划管理，克服生产中的盲目性和混乱现象，组织均衡生产。
