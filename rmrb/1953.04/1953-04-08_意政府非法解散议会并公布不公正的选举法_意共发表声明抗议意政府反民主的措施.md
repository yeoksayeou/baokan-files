Xinhua News Agency, April 5th, Rome dispatch: According to newspaper reports, the Italian President issued an order on the 4th to dissolve parliament and scheduled new elections for June 7th. The order to dissolve parliament illegally advanced the dissolution of the Senate, which had one year remaining in its term, to coincide with the dissolution of the lower house. Even bourgeois commentators admit that the Italian government's forceful passage of the anti-democratic election system "reform" law through parliament with a mechanical majority and the premature dissolution of the Senate are solely to ensure that the ruling Christian Democratic Party can obtain an effective majority in both houses in the next election, in order to intensify the implementation of anti-national and anti-democratic policies. According to the election system "reform" law proposed by the Gasperi government, any party or group of parties that obtains more than 50% plus one vote of the total votes can receive an additional 15% of the seats. The "reform" law also stipulates that the 87 "ex-officio senators" in the Senate will be abolished. The "ex-officio senators" were appointed on the basis of their anti-fascist credentials, and the largest number of them are members of the Italian Communist Party, who were appointed as "ex-officio senators" because of their contributions to the struggle against Mussolini's fascist regime.

One of the reasons why the Gasperi government has taken such desperate measures is its eagerness to approve the "European Army" treaty in accordance with the will of its American masters. Since the treaty was signed last May, only the West German Federal Parliament has reluctantly approved it. Gasperi had assured the Americans that he would approve the treaty before the parliamentary re-election, but he was resolutely opposed by the patriotic members of parliament from the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, who have broad support among the Italian people, and therefore failed. The Gasperi government attempts to dissolve parliament and re-elect it under a new election law that completely violates democratic principles, so that the ruling party can gain absolute control in both houses of parliament.

Italian Communist Party Secretary Donofrio published a statement in "Unità" on the matter, saying: Gasperi's shortening of the Senate's term of office irrefutably proves that he wants to force the people to accept a fraudulent election law. The government is intensifying its attempts to deal a fatal blow to the democratic system. Donofrio pointed out that the Senate has an anti-fascist character, because it has dozens of anti-fascist members who represent not only the opposition, but also various political viewpoints. Its essence is an obstacle to the clerical faction's plan to amend the constitution, undermine democracy, and restore fascist totalitarianism.

Donofrio called on all those who cherish the constitution and the fruits of the resistance movement to fully oppose the clerical faction's attack on democracy and the republican system.

Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: According to TASS, Rome: The Italian Communist Party issued a statement protesting the government's dissolution of the Senate and the promulgation of anti-democratic laws.

The statement of the Italian Communist Party stated: Millions of working people in all industries and citizens of all social strata openly condemn this unjust election law and condemn the illegal announcement of the results of the vote that did not actually take place in the Senate of the Republic. Communist leaders exposed the coercive behavior of Christian Democrats and the serious threats to freedom. Today, the primary task of honest and sincere democrats of all political persuasions is to be vigilant and defend the republican system.

The leadership of the Socialist Party also issued a statement calling on the working people to expose the conspiracies of the reactionaries in the upcoming elections. The statement also called on the people to be vigilant against provocations and cheating.

According to "Avanti!", former members of the Republican Party and the Social Democratic Party are increasingly determined to oppose the government's reactionary policies in the run-up to the election. Representatives of the "Spontaneous Socialist Movement," the "Republican Reform Alliance," and the "Justice and Liberty Movement" decided at a meeting to put forward a joint list of candidates in the upcoming elections. Former mayor of Milan and Social Democrat Greppi said that preventing the Christian Democratic group from obtaining more than half of the votes is "the primary and decisive task of all Italians who cherish independence and dignity."

In Cervignano (Province of Udine), members of the Social Democratic Party branch broke away from their former leadership and organized an independent branch.

    意政府非法解散议会并公布不公正的选举法
    意共发表声明抗议意政府反民主的措施
    【新华社五日讯】罗马消息：据报纸报道：意大利总统四日下令解散议会，并定六月七日举行新的选举。解散议会的命令非法地将还有一年任期的上院提前和下院一同解散。连资产阶级的言论也承认，意大利政府这次强暴地在议会以机械的多数通过反民主的选举制“改革”法并提前解散上院，完全是为了确保政府的天主教民主党能够在下届选举中获得两院的有效多数，以便加紧推行反民族和反民主的政策。按照加斯贝利政府提出的选举制“改革”法，任何党派或党派集团，如能获得比总票数的百分之五十多一票的选票，就可以得到另外百分之十五的席位。“改革”法还规定，上院的八十七名“当然上议员”席位将予取消。“当然上议员”是在反法西斯的基础上委任的，其中为数最多的是意大利共产党的议员，他们都是因为他们在反对墨索里尼法西斯政权的斗争中的贡献而受任为“当然上议员”。
    加斯贝利政府采取如此穷凶极恶的措施，其原因之一是急于要遵照美国主人的意志批准“欧洲军”条约。这个条约自从去年五月签订到现在，还只有西德联邦议院勉强批准。加斯贝利曾向美国人保证在议会改选前批准这个条约，但遭到拥有意大利人民广泛支持的共产党和社会党爱国议员们的坚决反对，以致未能成功。加斯贝利政府企图用解散议会和根据完全违反民主原则的新选举法重新选举，以使政府党能在议会两院都得到绝对的控制。
    意大利共产党书记多诺弗里奥在“团结报”上就此事发表声明说：加斯贝利要把上院任期缩短，无可争辩地证明了：他要强迫人民接受骗人的选举法。政府正变本加厉地企图给民主制度以致命的打击。多诺弗里奥指出：上院有着反法西斯的性质，因为他有几十个不仅代表反对派，而且代表各种不同政治见解的反法西斯的议员。他的本质是教权派实现修改宪法、破坏民主、恢复法西斯极权制度计划的障碍。
    多诺弗里奥号召一切珍爱宪法和抵抗运动的果实的人们，全力反对教权派对民主和共和制度的进攻。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党发表了一个声明，抗议政府解散上院和公布反民主的法律。
    意大利共产党的声明说：数百万各行业的劳动人民和各阶层的公民，公开谴责这个不公正的选举法，谴责非法宣布实际上并未在共和国上院内举行的表决结果。共产党领袖揭露天主教民主党人的胁迫行为和自由所遭到的严重威胁。今天一切政治派别的正直和真诚的民主分子的首要任务是提高警惕，保卫共和国制度。
    社会党领导机构也发表声明号召劳动人民揭露反动派在即将举行的选举中的阴谋。声明并号召人民警惕挑衅和作弊。
    据“前进报”报道：前共和党和社会民主党党员们在准备竞选期间日益坚决地声明反对政府反动政策。“自发的社会主义运动”、“共和党革新派联盟”和“正义与自由运动”的代表在一次会议上决定在行将到来的选举中提出一个联合候选人名单。前米兰市市长、社会民主党人格雷皮说，使天主教民主党集团不能得到半数以上的选票是“一切珍视独立与尊严的意大利人的首要的、决定性的任务”。
    在塞尔威格纳诺（乌提纳省），社会民主党支部的党员脱离了以前的领导，组织了一个独立自主的支部。
