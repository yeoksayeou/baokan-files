Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: According to statistics from the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, a progressive labor union in the United States, from the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 to the end of 1952, the pre-tax profits of major American corporations reached 107 billion US dollars, averaging 42.5 billion US dollars per year. This is approximately twice the average annual profit of 21.5 billion US dollars made by major American corporations during World War II.

After the outbreak of the Korean War, with the help of the government's war decrees, major American corporations greatly intensified their exploitation of workers by accelerating the system and suppressing wages. In the first half of 1950, major corporations extracted an average of 1,544 US dollars in profit per year from each industrial worker. By the end of 1952, this figure had risen to 1,796 US dollars, an increase of 16 percent.

    侵朝战争爆发以来美国大公司获利千余亿美元
    【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：根据美国进步工会联合电气、无线电与机器工人工会的统计，从一九五○年六月朝鲜战争爆发至一九五二年年底，美国大公司在纳税前的利润达到一千零七十亿美元，平均每年为四百二十五亿美元，比第二次世界大战期间美国大公司平均每年的利润二百一十五亿美元约多一倍。
    朝鲜战争发生后，靠着政府的战争法令的帮助，美国大公司利用加快制度与压低工资的办法大大加强对工人的剥削。一九五○年上半年，大公司平均一年从每一个产业工人身上榨取利润一千五百四十四美元，到一九五二年年底，这个数目上升到了一千七百九十六美元，即增加了百分之十六。
