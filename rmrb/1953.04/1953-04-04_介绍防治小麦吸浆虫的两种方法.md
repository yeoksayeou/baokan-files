Wheat blossom midge is a devastating pest during the wheat growing season. Judging from the situation in various regions, there is a possibility of a large-scale outbreak of wheat blossom midge this year. Therefore, vigorously organizing the masses and adopting effective control methods to kill this pest has become an important measure to ensure increased wheat production. Last year's experience proved that the net sweeping method and spraying "666" pesticide are very effective control methods. Now we introduce these two methods below:

I. Net Sweeping Method:

	1.  Net Making: Use a piece of sparse cloth (mosquito net cloth, mourning cloth, or other old cloth) that is 15 feet long and 2.5 feet wide. Tie wooden sticks or bamboo poles to both ends, and sew two hemp ropes on the upper and lower sides, or tie a long bamboo pole underneath to tighten the bottom, so that it can be inserted into the wheat ears to capture pests. When using, the cloth should be soaked. Wet cloth can stick adult wheat blossom midges, aphids, wheat spiders, and other pests.

	2.  Usage: From the time the wheat just emerges to the time the wheat is filled with milk, it is the occurrence period of adult wheat blossom midges. During this period, if pests are found, nets must be used to sweep and capture them in the field at any time. In the three or four days after rain, the adults emerge more, so sweeping and capturing should be intensified. The best time for catching insects is from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM and from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Sweeping and capturing can be done all day on cloudy days. Sweeping and capturing can also be done on windless, sultry moonlit nights. When there is wind or the sun is strong at noon, because the adults mostly hide under the wheat plants or pea vines, this method is not suitable for sweeping and capturing.

	3.  Net Sweeping Method: When using a cloth net, expose half of the net above the wheat ears and pull the other half below the wheat ears. The net can be slightly tilted back: the lower rope should be tightened, and the upper rope can be slightly loosened to make the net concave, which is easy to sweep and capture. When catching larvae, the net must be tilted and in contact with the wheat stalks. The two people holding the net should walk at the same pace and maintain an appropriate speed. If they walk slowly, the adults will fly away and not stick to the net; if they walk too fast, they will trample the wheat.

	4.  Precautions:

		(1) The net must be thoroughly wetted with water before sweeping. It is best to put two buckets of water at the edge of the field. When the weather is dry, soak the net once after each sweep, otherwise the insects will not stick to it.

		(2) Before using the net to capture wheat blossom midges, black smut plants should be removed, otherwise it will help spread the spores of black smut disease.

	5. Supplementary tools: In addition to using nets to kill adults, it is also very effective to sweep the wheat ears left and right with a net to capture adults, and it can also check the density of pest occurrence. Net making method:

		(1) Round net: Sew a piece of cloth into a two-foot-long conical bag, leaving a mouth with a diameter of one foot and two inches at one end. Make a circle with iron wire, willow branches, or bamboo strips to support the mouth. Tie a three-foot-long pole under the iron wire or willow branches. (2) Triangular net: Twist lead wire or willow branches, bamboo strips into an isosceles triangle (two sides are one foot long and the bottom is seven inches long), and attach a cloth bag to the net mouth. When adults are hiding between wheat plants, this net can be inserted between the ridges while walking and sweeping.

II. Method of Spraying "666" Pesticide Powder:

Spraying 5/1000 "666" pesticide powder with a powder duster to control wheat blossom midge is very effective. If there is no powder duster locally or the powder dusters are not enough, you can use a sparse cloth bag to hold the pesticide powder and hang it on a bamboo pole or wooden stick about ten feet long (three, four, six, or seven cloth bags can be hung horizontally on one bamboo pole). Two people carry it, walking and shaking it at the same time. The leaking pesticide powder can be sprinkled on the ground several feet wide. When spraying, pay attention to the following points:

	1. The effective period of "666" pesticide powder can only last for three days. After three days, the efficacy is not significant, and after five days it loses its effectiveness. Therefore, when using "666" pesticide powder, it must be sprayed every three to five days to ensure that the wheat is not harmed.

	2. Start spraying every five days from the time the wheat is pregnant with ears. Roughly spray the first time when the wheat is pregnant with ears, the second time when all the ears emerge, and the third time when the adults are still numerous during flowering.

	3. The total amount of pesticide used is about seven jin per mu. Spray the first time when the wheat plants are pregnant with ears. At this time, the adults are laying eggs, and the adults that have emerged have emerged one after another, so more pesticide should be sprayed, about three jin per mu. The pesticide sprayed at this time can not only directly kill the wheat blossom midges laying eggs, but the pesticide falling on the ground can also kill the adults that have just emerged or the adults that are about to emerge from the ground during the effective period. The amount of pesticide sprayed in the latter two times can be reduced to two jin per mu.

	4. The best time to spray is in the morning when there is no wind and there is dew, because at this time the adults have dew on their wings, are not very active, and have poor flight ability. At the same time, the wheat leaves are moist, and the pesticide powder is easy to adhere.

    介绍防治小麦吸浆虫的两种方法
    中央农业部植物保护司
    吸浆虫是小麦生长期间具有毁灭性的害虫。根据各地情况看来，今年小麦吸浆虫有大量发生的可能，因此，大力组织群众，采用有效的防治方法以杀灭这种害虫，就成为目前保证小麦增产的重要措施。去年经验证明，使用拉网法和喷撒“六六六”药剂的防治法收效都很大，现在把这两种方法介绍于下：
    一、拉网法：
    1、网的制法：用一丈五尺长，二尺五寸宽的稀布（蚊帐布、孝布或其他旧布），两端拴木棍或竹竿，上下两边缝上两条麻绳，或是在下面系上一根长竹竿使下面撑紧，以便插入麦穗下拉捕害虫。使用的时候，应把布浸湿，湿布能够黏住吸浆虫的成虫和蚜虫、麦蜘蛛等害虫。
    2、使用方法：自麦子刚出穗至麦子灌满浆时，是吸浆虫成虫的发生期，在这一期间，发现害虫，须随时用网兜到田中兜捕，在下雨后的三、四日内，成虫羽化较多，更应加紧拉捕。捕虫时间以早晨五时至八时和下午六时至九时最好，阴天可整日拉捕。无风闷热的月夜也可拉捕。有刮风或中午日烈时，因成虫多隐伏在麦株下或豌豆蔓间，不宜用这种方法拉捕。
    3、拉网方法：使用布网时，将网一半露出麦穗，一半拉到麦穗下面，网可稍向后仰：下面的绳子应拉紧，上面的绳子可稍松些，以使网成凹面，易于兜捕，捉幼虫时，网必须倾斜，与麦秆接触。持网的两人步伐要一致，并要保持适当速度，如果走慢了，成虫就会飞跑，黏不到网上；走快了，会踏坏麦子。
    4、注意事项：
    （1）拉网前要将网用水湿透。最好在地头放两个水桶，天干时，拉一次浸一次，不然黏不到虫子。
    （2）用网捕吸浆虫以前，应拔除黑穗病株，否则会帮助黑穗病的病菌胞子传播。
    5、补充工具：除了用拉网捕杀成虫之外，用网兜在麦穗上左右扫动，兜捕成虫，效果也很好，并且可以检查害虫发生密度。网兜的制法：
    （1）圆形网兜：用布缝成一个二尺长的锥形袋子，一头留个直径一尺二寸的口，用铁丝、柳条或竹条做个圈，撑在口上，铁丝或柳条下边拴上一条三尺长的杆子。（2）三角网：用铅丝或柳条、篾条绞成等腰三角形（两腰长一尺底长七寸），网口上缀布袋。在成虫潜藏麦株间，可用此网插入麦垅间边走边兜。
    二、喷撒“六六六”药粉方法：
    用喷粉器撒布千分之五的“六六六”药粉除治小麦吸浆虫，效果很好。如当地没有喷粉器或喷粉器不够用，可用稀布袋装药粉，挂在约一丈长的竹竿或木棍上（一竹竿上可横挂三、四个或六、七个布袋）两人抬着，一边走，一边振动，漏下的药粉可撒布在数尺宽的地面上。喷药时应注意下列各点：
    1、“六六六”药粉的有效期限只能维持三天，三天后药效即不显著，五天以后就失去效力。所以使用“六六六”药粉时，必须隔三天到五天喷撒一次，才能保证麦子不被害。
    2、从麦子孕穗时开始，每隔五天喷撒一次。大致在麦子孕穗时喷撒第一次，出齐穗喷第二次，扬花时如成虫还多再喷第三次。
    3、用药总量每亩约七斤，第一次在麦株孕穗时喷，这时成虫正在产卵，已经羽化的成虫已陆续出土，所以应该多喷药，每亩可喷三斤。这时喷的药粉不但可以直接杀灭产卵的吸浆虫，落到地面的药品，在有效期间内，还可以杀死刚羽化的成虫或是爬出地面快要羽化的成虫。后两次喷药量可减到每亩二斤。
    4、喷药时间最好在无风有露水的早晨，因为这时成虫翅膀上有露水，不很活动，飞翔力差，同时麦叶潮湿，药粉容易附着。
