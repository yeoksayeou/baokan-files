    Hubei Provincial Handicraft Industry Representative Conference
    Agreement on Several Issues Concerning Apprentices, Employees, and Labor-Management Relations

    With the rise of the rural economy, the increase in farmers' purchasing power, the growing needs of urban people, and the needs of national economic construction, the current handicraft production is already feeling the strain of failing to meet demand. In particular, production materials and daily necessities related to agricultural production and people's livelihoods are not only insufficient in quantity to meet the needs of the people, but also fail to meet the requirements of the people in terms of quality. Therefore, appropriately supporting and developing handicraft production based on needs and possibilities is not only a matter of the interests of the handicraft industry itself, but also a major issue for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, serving agricultural production, serving urban people, and serving national economic construction.

    The entire body of representatives at the Hubei Provincial Handicraft Industry Representative Conference, in view of this, in order to further improve various relationships in the handicraft industry, especially to improve production technology, improve product quality, and develop handicraft production to meet the needs of the objective situation, hereby makes the following agreement on several issues:

    Article One: The main task of apprentices is to learn technology well. Therefore, they must have a correct work attitude, abide by labor discipline, and obey the master's assignments and guidance in production. In addition to production, they should also do chores related to production to help the master increase production. However, the master shall not beat or abuse apprentices or force apprentices to do things that are completely unrelated to production, nor shall he interfere with apprentices' political and recreational activities. He must also break with conservative thinking, impart technology to apprentices, and promote teaching well, teaching quickly, and teaching completely. Promote respect for teachers and love for apprentices, and promote masters taking pride in teaching technology well, and apprentices taking pride in learning technology well.

    Article Two: Bosses can freely recruit new apprentices without restriction, but they must notify the trade union when determining to recruit apprentices and register with the local labor department. The treatment of newly recruited apprentices (in addition to food), generally, in the first year, a subsidy of ten to fifteen percent of the current salary level shall be given each month. In some industries where the situation is different, it may be higher or lower, as determined by both parties through negotiation. Afterwards, during the apprenticeship period (second and third years), it will be gradually increased according to their technology and production progress. Other benefits shall be in accordance with old habits.

    Article Three: Existing apprentices should mainly focus on learning technology well in the future, and masters should teach technology well. Both master and apprentice shall be responsible for signing a contract requiring that they be able to master certain skills by the time the apprenticeship is completed. If, for other reasons, the apprentice still has no skills even after the apprenticeship period has expired, they may continue to assist the master and learn technology, with wages negotiated by both parties.

    Article Four: Medical expenses for apprentices who become ill due to work, as certified by a doctor, shall be borne by the master for minor illnesses, mild illnesses, and short-term illnesses. For major illnesses, serious illnesses, and long-term illnesses, if the master has difficulty bearing the full cost, the worker may apply for a portion of the subsidy from the trade union member hardship fund at the discretion of the trade union.

    Article Five: The old practice of apprentices completing their apprenticeship in three years can be maintained, but technology should be taught well as early as possible. If the shop needs people due to production development after the apprenticeship is completed, they can stay and work voluntarily, and wages will be negotiated separately. If the shop does not need people, the master should, in the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, help the apprentice find employment in accordance with old habits.

    Article Six: Employment relations within the working people should handle all issues in the spirit of benefiting production, unity and mutual assistance, and negotiated solutions. Medical expenses shall be resolved in accordance with the contracts of each industry, or in accordance with custom if there is no contract. Other issues shall be handled in accordance with the Trade Union Law. If there are practical difficulties, both parties shall negotiate a solution.

    Article Seven: If there are disputes in labor-management relations, they should be resolved through consultation based on the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and management. If necessary, they may be mediated or arbitrated by the labor department or adjudicated by the court.

    Article Eight: Temporary workers can be dismissed after the term of employment expires and will not be treated as layoffs.

    Article Nine: Working hours in semi-mechanized factories and handicraft workshops shall generally not exceed ten hours per day. Working hours in scattered shops and workshops shall generally not exceed twelve hours per day.

    Article Ten: Rest days, including new and old holidays, are tentatively set at forty-five to seventy days per year. Each locality and industry can negotiate and stipulate specific arrangements in conjunction with specific circumstances (fixed holidays: three days for the Spring Festival, one day for New Year's Day, two days for National Day, and one day for May Day, with wages paid as usual; other holidays according to old customs). In addition, meetings and activities of grassroots trade union cadres shall not exceed two production days per month, and general worker activities shall not occupy production time.

    The above ten articles of the agreement shall be implemented after being reviewed, approved, and filed by the government. (Originally published in Hubei Daily)

    随着农村经济上升，农民购买力的提高，城镇人民需要的增多，以及国家经济建设的需要，目前手工业生产已感供不应求，尤其是和农民生产，人民生活有关的生产资料和生活资料，不仅在数量上不能满足人民的需要，而且在质量上也不能满足人民的要求。因此，根据需要与可能适当的扶持与发展手工业生产，就不单是手工业本身的利益问题，而是巩固工农联盟，为农业生产服务，为城镇人民服务，以及为国家经济建设服务的重大问题。
    湖北省手工业代表会议全体代表有鉴于此，为了进一步在手工业中改善各种关系，特别是提高生产技术，提高产品质量，发展手工业生产，以适应客观形势之需要，特对几项问题，作如下协议：

    第三项：现有学徒今后主要是学好技术，师傅教好技术，师徒双方负责订立合同，要求在学习期满时，能够掌握一定的技术，如因其他原因，虽到出师年限，学徒尚无技术者，可以继续帮师，学习技术，工资双方协议。
    第四项：学徒因公致病之医药费用，经医生检查证明，小病、轻病及短期病症由师傅负担，大病重病及长期病症，如师傅全部负担有困难时，可由工人申请，从工会会员困难补助金中酌情补助一部分。
    第五项：学徒三年出师之旧例可以保持，但应尽可能提前教好技术，出师后如因生产发展店内用人，双方自愿可以留下工作，工资另行协商。如店内不用人，师傅应本团结互助精神，根据旧有习惯，帮助学徒就业。
    第六项：劳动者内部的雇佣关系，应本有利生产，团结互助，协商解决之精神，处理一切问题，医药费按各行业之合同，如无合同即按习惯解决。其他问题根据工会法处理，如有实际困难，双方协商解决。
