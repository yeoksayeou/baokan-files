Comrades,

    On behalf of the Central People's Government, I extend warm congratulations to the Second National Women's Congress of China.

    Currently, our country is in a situation where the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea continues to achieve victories and strives for a ceasefire, the country's planned construction is beginning this year, and the elections for national and local people's congresses at all levels are about to take place. We are facing significant and glorious tasks, and therefore the convening of the Second National Women's Congress of China is of particular significance.

    Chinese women, especially the broad masses of working women, have made enormous contributions to the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause and the victory of national construction. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese women have, with an active, enthusiastic, diligent, and courageous spirit, thrown themselves in large numbers into the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, national construction, people's government work, and cultural, educational, health, and childcare work. More women have joined the land reform and other social reform movements. On the industrial and agricultural production fronts, the broad masses of Chinese working women have made extremely significant contributions.

    Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution and built the great People's Republic of China. At the same time, the status of Chinese women has been fundamentally changed. First, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates "abolishing the feudal system that binds women. Women shall have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. Freedom of marriage between men and women shall be implemented." In May 1950, the Central People's Government promulgated the "Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China" and carried out a series of measures to implement the Marriage Law. In February 1951, the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government made more complete provisions for protecting the reproductive health of female workers. In May 1951, the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government issued a notice stipulating that all agencies, enterprises, and schools shall not refuse to accept pregnant women when recruiting staff and students. For more than three years, the people's government health agencies have continuously promoted maternal and child health work and childcare. This March, the Central People's Government further stipulated in the promulgated "Electoral Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels" that "women have equal rights with men to elect and to be elected." All of these guarantee women's political and economic rights and stipulate women's equal social status in national law, thereby encouraging the masses of women to participate more actively in national construction and strive for production with greater enthusiasm. This fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic social system and national system. However, it must be pointed out that the above-mentioned decrees and policies have not yet been fully realized in all aspects, because any decree or policy requires concrete and arduous work, and sometimes even fierce struggles, to be fully realized. In addition to the people's governments at all levels continuing to strengthen leadership and do a good job, what is more important is the continuous efforts of the women themselves.

    Comrades, in order to meet the motherland's major and glorious construction tasks, it is necessary to summarize the past experience of women's work, continue to mobilize and organize the broad masses of women throughout the country, actively support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and strive for peace, enthusiastically participate in the national general election movement, and actively participate in industrial and agricultural production. Production must be regarded as the overriding central task and as a long-term task of women's work, because only by achieving true economic independence can women achieve complete liberation.

    Comrades, we fully believe that Chinese women will exert greater strength and achieve greater victories in national construction and various important tasks. We fully believe that under the call of the Second National Women's Congress, the women of the whole country will be more closely united, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will advance victoriously for the great construction of the motherland and the cause of world peace and democracy.

### 中央人民政府政务院董必武副总理的致词

    中央人民政府政务院董必武副总理的致词同志们：
    我代表中央人民政府向中国第二次全国妇女代表大会致热烈的祝贺。
    目前，我们的国家处在抗美援朝正继续取得胜利并争取停战实现，国家的计划建设正在今年开始，全国及地方各级人民代表大会的选举即将进行的时候，我们面临着重大而光荣的任务，因而中国第二次全国妇女代表大会的召开，是有特殊重大意义的。
    中国妇女，特别是广大的劳动妇女，对于中国人民革命的胜利事业、国家建设的胜利事业，贡献是巨大的。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，中国妇女们更以积极热情勤劳勇敢的姿态，大批地投身于抗美援朝工作、国家建设工作、人民政权工作和文化教育卫生保育工作，更多的妇女投身于土地改革和其他社会改革运动。而在工业和农业的生产战线上，中国广大的劳动妇女，都作了极其巨大的贡献。
    中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，取得了中国革命的胜利，建设了伟大的中华人民共和国，同时也根本地改变了中国妇女的地位。首先中国人民政协共同纲领规定了“废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由”的政策。一九五○年五月，中央人民政府公布了“中华人民共和国婚姻法”并进行了一系列关于贯彻婚姻法的措施。一九五一年二月中央人民政府政务院公布的劳动保险条例，对于保护女工生育健康问题，作了更完备的规定。一九五一年五月，中央人民政府人事部发出通知，规定了各机关、企业、学校招考工作人员及学员时，不得拒收孕妇。三年多以来，人民政府卫生机关不断地推广妇婴卫生工作和儿童保育事业。今年三月，中央人民政府更在公布的“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”中，明确地规定“妇女有与男子同等的选举权和被选举权”。所有这些，都是保障了妇女的政治和经济的权利，并把妇女的社会平等地位在国家法律上规定起来，从而鼓舞了妇女群众更加积极地参加国家建设、努力生产的热情。在这里，充分证明了人民民主的社会制度和国家制度的优越性。但是，必须指出，上述法令、政策还未能在各个方面完全使之成为事实，因为任何法令和政策都是需要通过具体的艰苦的工作，有时甚至还须进行剧烈的斗争，才能获得完全实现的。这除了各级人民政府应继续加强领导作好工作外，而更重要的还在于妇女们自身的不断地努力。
    同志们，为了迎接祖国的重大而光荣的建设任务，必须总结过去妇女工作的经验，继续动员和组织全国广大妇女群众，积极地支持抗美援朝和争取和平的斗争，热烈地参加全国的普选运动，积极地参加工业和农业的生产，把生产作为压倒一切的中心任务，作为妇女工作的长期任务，因为妇女只有在经济上取得真正独立的地位，才能获得彻底的解放。
    同志们，我们完全相信，中国妇女将在国家建设事业和各种重要工作中，发挥更大的力量，取得更大的胜利。我们完全相信，在全国第二次妇女代表大会的号召下，将更紧密地团结全国妇女群众，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为祖国的伟大建设和世界和平民主事业而胜利前进。
