    移交中国长春铁路的清理工作结束
    苏方主要负责人叶洛果夫同志离京返哈尔滨
    【新华社三日讯】负责办理移交中苏共管中国长春铁路事宜的中苏联合委员会的清理工作已告结束。中苏联合委员会苏方主要负责人叶洛果夫和我方主要负责人余光生已将工作报告呈交中华人民共和国中央人民政府。叶洛果夫在本月二日晚离京返哈尔滨，不日起程返国。前往车站欢送的有中央人民政府铁道部滕代远部长，王世泰、石志仁副部长，铁道部政治部桂蓬副主任，中国铁路工会全国委员会李颉伯主席，中苏联合委员会我方主要负责人余光生和铁道部机关干部职工代表等二百余人。
    叶洛果夫同志在北京期间，曾应滕代远部长的邀请，向铁道部机关干部作了报告。叶洛果夫在报告时说明中长铁路在共管期间取得很大的成绩，主要是由于领导干部学习了列宁斯大林的工作作风，发扬了革命胆略与实事求是的精神，并推行了许多苏联铁路的先进经验。这些经验主要是：改造组织机构与贯彻负责制、编制综合的生产财务计划、制订技术组织措施、开展爱国主义劳动竞赛、签订集体合同、加速流动资金周转以及推行经济核算制等。
