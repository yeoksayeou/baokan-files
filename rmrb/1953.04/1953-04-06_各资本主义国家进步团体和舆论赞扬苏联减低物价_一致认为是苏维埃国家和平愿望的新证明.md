Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The recent news of the Soviet Union's further reduction of prices on food and manufactured goods has provoked widespread reaction among progressive organizations and public opinion in capitalist countries. According to TASS: The Anglo-Soviet Friendship Society recently issued a statement saying that this measure by the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party is new proof of the Soviet state's desire for peace. Regardless of what social system a government is under, it is impossible to systematically reduce prices like this if it does not adopt a policy of peace.

The French newspaper "l'Humanité" contrasted the repeated reduction of food and manufactured goods prices in the Soviet Union with the continuous rise in prices in the United States, France, and other capitalist countries. The newspaper pointed out that the contrast between these facts and the contrast between the two policies cannot but convince all honest people of the superiority of the Soviet socialist system over the capitalist system.

The West German "Socialist People's Newspaper" commented on the Soviet price reductions by discussing the increasingly deteriorating living conditions of the working people in West Germany. The newspaper pointed out that due to the Adenauer government's unscrupulous implementation of a policy of war preparations, the price of bread in West Germany has soared, followed by the price of butter. The fare for transportation in Frankfurt am Main has risen since April 1st, and theater ticket prices have risen by 20 percent since April 2nd. All of this affects the daily lives of the people. The newspaper called on the West German working class to combine the struggle to improve living conditions with the struggle against the Bonn-Paris war treaty.

Finnish democratic newspapers all published articles on the Soviet price reductions. "The People's Daily" emphasized that the Soviet price reductions are a vivid demonstration of the rapid growth of social production. The Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government have consistently guided Soviet society forward in accordance with the basic economic laws of socialism discovered and expounded by Stalin.

Danish newspapers also published news of the Soviet price reductions. "Land and People's Daily" said that the Soviet Union's price reduction is part of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. This plan stipulates that the actual wages of workers and employees, including the benefits obtained from reducing retail prices, should increase by at least 35 percent. This is a natural result of the victorious development of the socialist economy. But in Denmark, the price of black bread is about to rise by 70 percent, and milk is about to rise by 12 percent. This is the result of the Danish government's implementation of a rearmament policy.

In Uruguay, the Montevideo newspaper "Semanario de la Justicia" also compared the domestic situation with the situation in the Soviet Union in its editorial. The editorial said that there is no crisis or unemployment in the Soviet Union, and all its strength is devoted to peaceful construction. This Soviet price reduction shows that the Soviet Union, which pursues a policy of peace, is far superior to capitalist countries that prepare for war, plunder, and enslave the people of all countries.

    各资本主义国家进步团体和舆论赞扬苏联减低物价
    一致认为是苏维埃国家和平愿望的新证明
    【新华社五日讯】苏联最近再次减低食品和制成品价格的消息，在资本主义国家的进步团体和舆论中引起了广泛反应。据塔斯社消息：英苏友好协会最近就这件事发表声明说：苏联政府和苏联共产党的这种措施是苏维埃国家的和平愿望的新证明。不管一个政府是处于怎样的社会制度下，如果它不采取和平政策，就不可能这样有系统地减低物价。
    法国的“人道报”把苏联一再减低食品和制成品价格和美国、法国以及其他资本主义国家物价不断上涨的情况作了对比。该报指出：这些事实的对比和两种政策的对比，使所有诚实的人不能不相信苏联社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的优越性。
    西德“社会主义人民报”在评论苏联减低物价时谈到了西德劳动人民生活条件日益恶化的情况。该报指出：由于阿登纳政府毫无忌惮地实行备战政策，西德的面包价格高涨了，接着牛油也上涨了。美因河畔法兰克福的车费自四月一日起上涨，戏院票价自四月二日起上涨百分之二十。所有这些都影响人民的日常生活。该报号召西德工人阶级把要求改善生活状况的斗争和反对波恩与巴黎战争条约的斗争结合起来。
    芬兰的民主报纸都登载了有关苏联减低物价的文章。“劳动人民报”着重指出：苏联的减低物价是社会生产迅速增长的生动证明。苏联共产党和苏联政府一贯是引导着苏联社会按照斯大林所发现和阐明的社会主义基本经济法则前进的。
    丹麦的报纸也刊载了苏联减低物价的消息。“国土与人民报”说，苏联的这一次减低物价是第五个五年计划的一部分。这个计划规定的职工的实际工资，连减低零售价格所获得的利益计算在内，至少要增加百分之三十五。这是社会主义经济胜利发展的自然的结果。但在丹麦，黑面包的价格即将上涨百分之七十，牛奶即将上涨百分之十二。这是丹麦政府实行重整军备政策的后果。
    在乌拉圭，蒙得维的亚报纸“公理周报”的社论也把本国情况和苏联的情况作了对比。社论说：苏联没有危机和失业，那里一切的力量都献给和平建设。苏联这次减低物价说明，奉行和平政策的苏联，比备战、掠夺和奴役各国人民的资本主义国家要优越得多。
