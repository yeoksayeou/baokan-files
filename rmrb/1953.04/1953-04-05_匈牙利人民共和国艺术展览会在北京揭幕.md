To celebrate the eighth anniversary of the liberation of the Hungarian People's Republic, the "Art Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic," sponsored by the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, officially opened at the Water Pavilion of Zhongshan Park in Beijing on the 4th.

The opening ceremony was presided over by Ambassador Sándor Sziklai, who said in his speech: This exhibition is a new proof of the good development of Sino-Hungarian cultural cooperation. Although it can only partially reflect the multifaceted heritage of Hungarian art and its historical development, it can still explain to Chinese friends and Chinese workers the struggle of Hungarian art in the past and present.

Vice Premier Guo Moruo then spoke. He pointed out: This exhibition has particularly important political significance today. Here, culture and politics are closely linked. Today we celebrate a freedom-loving nation that was liberated eight years ago; we admire the excellent art of this nation and the heroic struggle expressed in the art; we believe that the workers who fight for freedom and happiness will always open up a better future for mankind as victors!

After the ceremony, Ambassador Sándor Sziklai accompanied the guests on a tour of the exhibition.

The exhibition displays reproductions of Hungarian 19th-century and modern oil paintings, woodcuts, sculptures, pictures of important revolutionary events in past dynasties, and folk art from various regions of Hungary.
