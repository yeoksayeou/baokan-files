    Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: The Thai Phibun government recently openly agreed with the United States to provide another seven battalions of cannon fodder, five companies of which are scheduled to be sent to Laos to assist in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Because this measure has been opposed by the broad masses of the Thai people, the Phibun government is intensifying the suppression of the domestic peace movement and stepping up war propaganda to create a tense atmosphere.

    On February 6th, Thai police began bringing several Thai peace supporters, who were illegally arrested in November and December of last year, to court for trial. The Thai police fabricated a charge against them of "engaging in internal and external armed activities."

    The Thai police authorities deliberately mixed some disgruntled military personnel with peace supporters for trial. However, the conspiracy of the Thai secret agents has become increasingly obvious: Nai Samut Surathuetka, who was once promoted by the Thai police as the head of a so-called "National Liberation Movement," has now formally become a "witness" for the police.

    While persecuting Thai peace supporters, the Thai police illegally detained and interrogated Qiu Jian, the general manager of the Chinese newspaper "Quan Min Bao" in Bangkok, and other Chinese, and included them in the same "case" for trial, wantonly slandering them in an attempt to confuse the Thai public.

    At the same time, the Thai government is also stepping up propaganda hostile to the People's Republic of China. Phibun has brazenly stated that he wants to organize an anti-communist "Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army" and is preparing to forcibly conscript Overseas Chinese as cannon fodder.

    The Thai government is extremely hostile to the peace movement. The Thai Ministry of Interior even issued a circular to all government agencies and administrative commissioners of each province, prohibiting the use of the word "peace."

    The Thai government's measures to suppress the domestic peace movement, like a series of previous war preparations, were carried out under the instructions of the US government. Nai Pao, the Director-General of the Thai Police, openly admitted during the massive terror arrests at the end of last year that the Thai government took these actions because it accepted the "advice" of the United States. During the Thai police interrogation of the arrested peace supporters, four American "experts" were stationed at the Bangkok Police Club, maintaining "close contact" with senior Thai police officers. Secret agents of the Thai Police Department used torture commonly used by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to abuse some of the arrested peace supporters.

    However, the persecuted Thai peace supporters have not succumbed to the reactionaries. The broad masses of the Thai people are united around the peace supporters. The masses of Bangkok citizens expressed their support for the peace supporters by taking care of the families of those arrested and attending court hearings. During the days when prominent Thai peace supporters were being persecuted, the Thai people widely circulated the peace poems of the famous Chilean peace poet Pablo Neruda.

    銮披汶反动政府充当美国侵略帮凶加紧迫害和平运动
    泰国和平拥护者团结广大人民英勇斗争
    【新华社十三日讯】泰国銮披汶政府不久以前公然答应美国，再次提供七个营的炮灰，其中五个连预定派遣到寮国帮助侵略越南的战争。由于这一措施遭到泰国广大人民的反对，銮披汶政府正加紧镇压国内和平运动，并加紧作战争宣传来制造紧张空气。
    泰国警察二月六日开始把去年十一、十二月间非法逮捕的泰国和平拥护者多人提到法庭上审讯。泰国警察给他们捏造了一个“从事内部和外部的武装活动”的罪名。
    泰国警察当局故意把一些失意军人与和平拥护者混在一起加以审讯。然而，泰国特务的阴谋已越来越明显：曾经被泰国警察宣传为一个所谓“民族解放运动”的头子的乃沙没·素腊确甲，现在已经正式作警察方面的“证人”。
    在迫害泰国和平拥护者的同时，泰国警察非法拘捕和审讯曼谷华侨报纸“全民报”的总经理邱健等华侨多人，并把他们列入同一“案件”加以审讯，恣意诬蔑他们，企图扰乱泰国民众的视听。
    同时，泰国政府还加紧作敌视中华人民共和国的宣传。銮披汶曾悍然表示要组织反共的“华侨志愿军”，准备强征华侨当炮灰。
    泰国政府极端仇视和平运动。泰国内政部甚至通令各政府机关和各府的行政专员，禁止使用“和平”的字眼。
    泰国政府镇压国内和平运动的措施，和以往一系列准备战争的措施一样，是在美国政府指使下进行的。泰国警察总监乃炮在去年年底执行恐怖的大逮捕时曾公开承认：泰国政府采取这些行动是因为接受了美国的“劝告”。在泰国警察盘讯被捕的和平拥护者期间，四名美国“专家”经常驻在曼谷警察俱乐部，和泰国高级警官保持“密切接触”。泰国警察厅的密探使用美国联邦调查局所惯常使用的酷刑，来虐待一部分被捕的和平拥护者。
    但是，被迫害的泰国和平拥护者们，并没有在反动派面前屈服。泰国广大人民团结在和平拥护者的周围。曼谷市民群众以照顾被捕者家属和到法庭听审等行动，来表示对和平拥护者的支持。在泰国著名和平拥护者受到迫害的日子里，泰国人民广泛地传诵智利著名和平诗人聂鲁达的和平诗歌。
