Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 19th: The New York "Daily Worker" on the 12th commented on the so-called "report of facts" issued by the US Department of Defense on April 12th. The Daily Worker said that the US government's publication of defamatory statements about the abuse of prisoners of war by Korea and China is aimed at launching a political persecution of American prisoners of war and "offsetting the increasingly loud calls within the United States for the resumption of truce negotiations and an end to the Korean War."

The "Daily Worker" continued, the Defense Department's announcement of a plan to "reform" prisoners of war "raises concerns that the government will use screening and investigation methods against American prisoners of war, similar to those used against labor unions and ordinary people, to threaten and coerce these returning American soldiers not to express opinions or to endorse the US government's views."

The "Daily Worker" mentioned the Defense Department's admission that it had privately opened and read letters written by prisoners of war to their relatives, and said that this matter "is reminiscent of what Chinese peace activists said last year about the US authorities preventing prisoners of war from receiving letters from their relatives. It is said that the relatives of the prisoners of war told the prisoners of war in their letters about the facts of American taxes, prices, and the increasingly severe deprivation of civil rights, and expressed their own desire for peace."

The "Daily Worker" also said: "The government regards the desire for peace expressed by American prisoners of war or their relatives at home as 'Communist propaganda.'"

According to the "Daily Worker": Thomas Richardson, chairman of the American Peace Crusade, believes that the agreement to exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war is a "victory for the peace movement." Richardson said: "However, the truly important work still lies ahead for peace-loving people. This work is to end the current futile slaughter in Korea."

    美“工人日报”斥美政府企图迫害回国战俘
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】纽约“工人日报”十二日评论美国国防部在四月十二日发表的所谓“事实报告”。工人日报说，美国政府发表污蔑朝鲜和中国虐待战俘的声明，其背后的目的是发动对美国战俘的政治迫害和“抵销美国国内日益响亮的要求恢复停战谈判及结束朝鲜战争的呼声”。
    “工人日报”继续说，国防部宣布“改造”战俘的计划，“使人担心政府将用对付工会和老百姓的甄别和调查的方法来对付美国战俘，借以威胁和强迫这些回国的美国士兵不发表意见或附和美国政府的意见”。
    “工人日报”谈到国防部承认私自拆阅战俘写给他们亲属的信件，并说，这件事使人“回想到中国和平人士去年所说的美国当局不让战俘接到他们亲属的信件的事情。据说战俘的亲属们在信中告诉战俘关于美国赋税、物价和愈来愈厉害的剥夺民权的事实，并表示了他们自己要求和平的愿望。”
    “工人日报”又说：“美国战俘或他们的亲属在国内所表示的和平愿望。都被政府认为是‘共产党宣传’。”
    据“工人日报”报道：美国和平十字军主席托马斯·理查逊认为交换病伤战俘协定是“和平运动的胜利”。理查逊说：“不过，真正重大的工作还摆在爱好和平人士的前面。这个工作就是要结束目前朝鲜的无益屠杀。”
