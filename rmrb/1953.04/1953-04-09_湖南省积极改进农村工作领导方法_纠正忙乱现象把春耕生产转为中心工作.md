    Hunan Province Actively Improves Leadership Methods in Rural Work
    Corrects Chaotic Situation, Transforms Spring Plowing Production into the Central Task
    Party and government leading organs in Hunan Province have begun to improve leadership methods in rural work, correct the chaotic situation, and make spring plowing production the overriding central task at present. In early April, Zhou Hui, Deputy Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Yuan Renyuan and Cheng Xingling, Vice Chairmen of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, and other responsible cadres led more than 110 cadres to form six spring plowing production inspection teams, which went to various special districts to inspect spring plowing production, urge local authorities to implement the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on spring plowing production, and help local farmers solve difficulties in production.
    In order to implement the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on spring plowing production, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a joint meeting of prefectural committee secretaries in late March and early April to study and discuss the three documents on rural work issued by the Central Committee. After the meeting, the Liling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized farmers to launch a second mass spring plowing production inspection and appraisal campaign throughout the county, which vigorously promoted spring plowing work. After the work group of the Lingling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party arrived in Liangwan Township, it helped the township cadres to set up a work committee to transform spring plowing production into the overriding central task, and all other work had to be carried out through the work committee and around production. After doing so, the production enthusiasm of the farmers and cadres was greatly enhanced. Luo Zhenglu, the public security commissioner of the township, who had not accumulated a single load of fertilizer in the past, now accumulates more than 20 loads of fertilizer in three days. The Liuyang County People's Government promoted the system of township cadres taking turns on duty in the first district of the county and the method of assigning township cadres to lead farmers' production in different areas according to their residences, correcting the previous chaotic work situation where township cadres had no mind to lead production. The farmers of Shiqishi Township in Dong'an County had the habit of not going to the fields until after "Jingzhe" (the Awakening of Insects), so the Party branch used the principle of "three days early is equivalent to a winter" summarized from the masses to educate the farmers to start spring plowing early. The whole township plowed nearly 100 mu of land before "Jingzhe." (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南省积极改进农村工作领导方法
    纠正忙乱现象把春耕生产转为中心工作
    湖南省的党、政领导机关开始改进农村工作的领导方法，纠正忙乱现象，使春耕生产成为当前压倒一切的中心工作。四月初，中共湖南省委员会副书记周惠、湖南省人民政府副主席袁任远、程星龄等负责干部，率领了一百一十多个干部，组成六个春耕生产检查团，分别到各专区检查春耕生产情况，督促各地贯彻中共中央关于春耕生产的指示，并帮助各地农民解决生产中的困难问题。
    为了贯彻中共中央关于春耕生产的指示，中共湖南省委员会曾在三月底四月初，召开了地委书记联席会议，学习和讨论了中央发出的三个有关农村工作的文件。会后，中共醴陵县委员会便发动农民，在全县范围内展开了第二次群众性的春耕生产检查评比运动，有力地推动了春耕工作。中共零陵县委员会工作组到达良湾乡后，帮助乡干部专门成立了工作委员会，把春耕生产转为压倒一切的中心工作，其他一切工作必须通过工作委员会、围绕生产进行。这样做了之后，农民们和干部们的生产热情大为增强。该乡的公安委员罗正禄过去没有积一担肥，现在三天就积肥二十多担。浏阳县人民政府推广了该县第一区乡干部轮流值日的制度和按乡干部住址分片包干领导农民生产的办法，纠正了以往工作忙乱，乡干部没有心思领导生产的现象。东安县石期市乡农民有不到“惊蛰”不下田的习惯，党支部就用从群众中总结出来的“提早三日当一冬”的道理，教育农民提早春耕，全乡在“惊蛰”前共犁田近百亩。（新华社）
