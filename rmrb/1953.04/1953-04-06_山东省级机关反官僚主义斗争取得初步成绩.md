The anti-bureaucracy struggle of Shandong provincial organs, from the end of January to the present, has for the most part concluded its focused inspection phase in most departments and is gradually entering the construction phase. This anti-bureaucracy struggle in Shandong provincial organs, under the specific guidance of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee, revolved around the current central task, seized upon the main problems in key work for inspection, analysis, and criticism. It adopted a combination of top-down inspection and bottom-up criticism, as well as a method of inspecting and improving simultaneously, and has now achieved initial results.

First, after this inspection, cadres in general, especially leading cadres, have recognized the seriousness and harm of bureaucracy, and recognized that the commandism and illegal and undisciplined phenomena existing among lower-level cadres are inseparable from the bureaucracy of leading organs. At the same time, they also realized that the causes of bureaucracy are mainly the failure to study policies, the failure to understand the situation at the lower levels, working blindly, and a simplistic style. For example, when the Shandong Provincial Cooperative Headquarters deployed work to develop members in September of last year, it did not proceed from reality and blindly demanded the development of five million members, nor did it explain policy boundaries and methods. Because the task was heavy and the requirements were urgent, many lower-level cadres used the method of "熬鹰" (meaning not being allowed to leave the meeting until the task was accepted) to develop members. In last year's drought prevention, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry subjectively stipulated the task of digging 1.2 million wells. Many lower-level cadres used the method of "encircling land" to order the masses to dig wells. These errors, caused by bureaucracy at the top, aroused vigilance in the minds of cadres after exposure, analysis, and criticism. Therefore, in the current work, the leadership style has undergone great changes. For example, in order to prevent bureaucracy in leading spring plowing production, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has transferred one-third of the department and bureau-level cadres of the provincial organs as the backbone, forming spring plowing inspection teams to go to the countryside to inspect spring plowing work and help lower-level cadres summarize the experience of leading spring plowing production. Cadres from various professional departments participating in the spring plowing inspection team (such as banks and cooperatives) will, according to their own business, go deep into the masses to understand their hardships and demands in order to improve the work of their business departments and further adapt to the needs of the masses. The Commercial Department's leadership style has changed significantly. When the department convened the provincial trade work conference in February, it conducted typical investigations before the meeting. When summarizing the work in 1952, it mobilized cadres from local industry and commerce bureaus and section-level cadres and professional company cadres to raise opinions, and carried out top-down inspection and bottom-up criticism. The deployment of future work such as material exchange, commercial adjustment, and commercial network establishment was based on the specific situations reflected from below. The previous deviation of subjectively dividing market types was also corrected. When deploying the work of material exchange after the Spring Festival, it first analyzed the current characteristics of the off-season: the slow sales of local and sideline products, which would affect farmers' spring plowing production. Based on this, it determined the policy of actively promoting local and sideline products, fully supplying farmers' production and living materials, and assisting farmers in disaster areas to carry out production for self-relief. After the task was deployed, it also explained the policies and methods, mainly to grasp the price policy, prevent formalism, and avoid the task view of calculating achievements solely based on the amount of transaction, and repeatedly explained that the standard for measuring achievements was how many problems were solved for farmers. After the meeting, some section chiefs of the Commercial Department exchanged views individually with the cadres who attended the meeting. Finding that some cadres still had unclear ideas and practices in their minds, they conducted research and summarized them in small special topics. The cadres who attended the meeting said with satisfaction: "The anti-bureaucracy has really worked; this meeting has changed, with principles, policies, and methods."

Second, the mass viewpoint of leading cadres has been strengthened. In the past, many leading cadres in Shandong provincial organs had a weak mass viewpoint and did not care about the suffering of the masses. This was prominently manifested in a large backlog of letters from the people and indifference to the difficulties of the masses. When the Shandong Cooperative Headquarters promoted chemical fertilizers, agricultural implements and other means of production last year, it found that lower-level cadres had coercive commandism as early as March, and then found it continuously. However, the Cooperative Headquarters only stayed at notification; it was not until a person was forced to death in Laiyang County that it sent someone to investigate and deal with it. In this anti-bureaucracy struggle, by inspecting the mass viewpoint and exposing the serious facts of losses caused by disregarding the interests and suffering of the masses, which damaged the Party's policies and the government's prestige, it aroused the ideological transformation of many leading cadres. This is mainly reflected in great improvements in handling letters and visits from the people. Not long ago, Dazhong Daily of Shandong Province forwarded a letter from Fan Ling, a reader of Dezhou Industrial Company, to the Finance Department of Shandong Provincial People's Government, reflecting that the local agricultural implement manufacturing factory could not solve the supply of materials, which affected production. After receiving the letter, the responsible cadre of the Finance Department immediately instructed the supply office under the department to investigate and solve it, and quickly solved the problem of supplying more than 2,000 tons of iron needed by the agricultural implement manufacturing factory in the first quarter. On February 19, two farmers from Bali Po and Haojia Village in Yangxin County, Huimin Special District, went to the Shandong Provincial People's Government to reflect that the local government had not taken into account the war wounds and floods and droughts suffered by the two villages in the work of checking fields, determining production, and reducing or exempting grain. After Zhang Yaozeng, Director of the Finance Department, learned about it, he personally discussed it with the Deputy Director of the Agricultural Taxation Office. On the one hand, they asked the provincial government for instructions and telegraphed to Huimin Prefectural Commissioner's Office to investigate and deal with it; on the other hand, they immediately dispatched capable cadres to form a nine-person investigation team with the Huimin Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Yangxin County People's Government to conduct specific investigations. In addition to solving the reduction and exemption problems of Bali Po and Haojia Village, appropriate reductions and exemptions were also made for surrounding villages with similar situations.

Third, centralized leadership has been strengthened, and the decentralized phenomenon of "multiple policies from different sources" has been initially overcome. In the 1953 Work Program of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, the work pace of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government and governments at all levels was unified, and the provincial government also controlled the provincial conferences convened by various units and the documents issued to the lower levels, and canceled the right of the section level to issue documents to the lower levels (experience can be reported and introduced). Due to the strengthening of centralized leadership and the emphasis on the implementation of the system of requesting instructions and reporting, the number of meetings has been reduced by 80% in the past month, and the number of documents issued to the lower levels has also been reduced by more than half. At the same time, it has prevented new bureaucracy and commandism that may arise in the current work. For example, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry planned to hold nine professional conferences in the busy agricultural month of March, which has been promptly stopped by the provincial government. The Forestry Bureau of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry generally instructed the whole province to fight pine caterpillars, but it did not clarify where there were pine caterpillars in the province, how much area was infested with pine caterpillars, whether the trees with pine caterpillars were publicly or privately owned, and whether there was a cost for organizing the masses to fight pine caterpillars. This instruction was also promptly corrected by the provincial government.

Fourth, the door of criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, has been opened, a democratic system has been initially established, democratic life within and outside the Party has been strengthened, and the supervision of the masses over the leadership has been strengthened, laying the foundation for continuing the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the future. In the past, Shandong's first-level organs lacked the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism. Some leading cadres with bad work styles also suppressed criticism and attacked critics. For example, Wang Zhe, Director of the Department of Culture and Education, used covert methods to attack critics; some leading cadres also used handwriting methods to track down people who wrote critical letters, and accused critics of being undisciplined and unorganized. Therefore, many cadres had many concerns about criticizing leaders. They were afraid of "wearing small shoes," afraid of "keeping a record," and afraid of "opening a soy sauce shop" (that is, adding fuel to the fire and exaggerating the shortcomings of critics in order to retaliate). This anti-bureaucracy struggle first targeted those who suppressed critics and supported the cadres. Especially after the Huang Yifeng incident was announced, cadres in general saw that the Party was supporting them, so they boldly launched criticism. Cadres of the Shandong Cooperative Headquarters raised more than 2,000 opinions on the leadership work of the headquarters. Cadres of the supply office of the headquarters alone raised more than 300 opinions. The leading cadres of the Commercial Department paid attention to the criticism opinions, so that every case was settled, which greatly encouraged the general cadres. In the past, the "Study Life" newspaper published by the Party Committee of the Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs rarely published criticism articles, but now criticism articles occupy a large amount of space. The Shandong Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee, the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and the Party Committee of the Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs often receive critical opinions from lower-level cadres. After this inspection, most departments and bureaus of the Shandong Provincial People's Government have formulated meeting reporting systems, inspection work and democratic supervision systems, and some units have begun to implement the system of reporting work to机关工作人员 on a regular basis.

The reason why the anti-bureaucracy struggle of Shandong provincial organs has achieved results is mainly due to:

First, the implementation of the policy of "anti-prevention-construction simultaneously" proposed by the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee, closely focusing on the current work, seizing the main problems in key work, especially issues of a policy nature, for inspection, analysis, and criticism. For example, the Department of Industry inspected the blindness in basic construction and the erroneous thinking of not relying on workers in enterprise management; the Department of Transportation inspected the subjective adventurism in navigation work, the inversion of priorities in basic construction, and the coercive commandism in transportation work that violated policies; the Cooperative Headquarters inspected the supply system thinking of not counting costs and being clueless. This hit the key points of bureaucrats and avoided general inspections that had little relationship with the current work. The method of inspecting and improving simultaneously avoided making new bureaucracy in the current work, and made the anti-bureaucracy struggle immediately produce results.

Second, the method of combining top-down inspection and bottom-up criticism was adopted. This anti-bureaucracy struggle of Shandong provincial organs was launched in the study of Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Everyone was ideologically prepared early. After mobilization at all levels, explaining the principles, policies and specific practices of this anti-bureaucracy, the masses quickly brewed, and then the leading cadres humbly made self-examinations and mobilized the masses to raise opinions, and conducted in-depth inspections from bottom to top, which made the main problems quickly clear and avoided the lengthy review that affected the current work.

Third, from key events to key people. Starting with inspecting the work, after exposing, analyzing, and criticizing the errors in the work, and then tracing the responsibility of people. This will avoid the deviation of getting entangled in people at the beginning and making the struggle unable to develop smoothly.

This anti-bureaucracy struggle of Shandong provincial organs also has shortcomings. The main one is that the development of the struggle in various organs is not balanced enough. The leading cadres of some organs, due to the lack of the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, have been slow to make reviews. For example, Wang Zhe, Director of the Department of Culture and Education, took a delaying attitude at the beginning, even though people had already found his mistakes to be serious. This affected the development of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in that organ.

In addition, individual responsible cadres have developed negative emotions after inspection and criticism. They dare not boldly take responsibility for their work and have adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards organ construction. Some cadres think that the struggle is coming to an end, and have produced麻痹 thinking. Therefore, there is still bureaucracy in the work of individual organs. This situation has attracted the attention of the Shandong provincial leadership and is being corrected.

    山东省级机关反官僚主义斗争取得初步成绩
    山东省级机关的反官僚主义斗争，从一月底到目前止，大部分机关有重点的检查工作已告结束，并逐步进入建设阶段。山东省级机关的这次反官僚主义斗争，在中共中央山东分局的具体指导下，围绕着当前中心工作，抓住主要工作中的主要问题进行检查、分析和批判，采取了自上而下的检查和自下而上的批评相结合、一面检查一面改进的办法，现已取得初步成效。
    第一，经过这次检查，一般干部特别是领导干部，已认识到官僚主义的严重性和危害性，认识到下层干部中存在的命令主义与违法乱纪现象是和领导机关的官僚主义分不开的。同时也认识到产生官僚主义的原因主要是不研究政策，不了解下情，盲目工作，作风简单。如山东省合作总社在去年九月布置发展社员工作时，不从实际出发，盲目要求发展五百万社员，也不交代政策界限和作法。因为任务重，要求急，不少下层干部就用开会“熬鹰”（意即不接受任务不能散会）的办法发展社员。农林厅在去年防旱中布置打井工作，主观地规定了打一百二十万眼井的任务，下层许多干部就用“圈地”的办法命令群众打井。这些由于上面官僚主义而产生的错误，经过揭发和分析批判之后，在干部思想上引起了警惕，因此在当前工作中，领导作风已有了很大的转变。如山东省人民政府为了防止在领导春耕生产中发生官僚主义，已抽调省级机关三分之一的厅、局、处长级干部作骨干，组成春耕检查团下乡检查春耕工作，帮助下层干部总结领导春耕生产的经验。参加春耕检查团的各专业部门的干部（如银行、合作社）将根据自己的业务，深入群众，了解群众的疾苦和要求，以改进本业务部门的工作，进一步适应群众的需要。领导作风转变较显著的是商业厅。该厅于二月份召开全省贸易工作会议时，会前曾作了典型调查；会上总结一九五二年的工作时，发动各地工商局局、科干部与专业公司干部提意见，进行了自上而下的检查和自下而上的批评；对今后的物资交流、商业调整、商业网的设置等工作，都根据下面反映的具体情况作了布置。对过去主观划分市场类型的偏差也作了纠正。在布置春节后的物资交流工作时，首先分析了目前淡季的特点是土、副产品的滞销，会影响农民春耕生产。据此确定了积极推销土、副产品，充分供应农民生产、生活资料并辅助灾区农民进行生产自救的方针。任务布置后，又交代了政策和作法，主要是掌握价格政策，防止形式主义及单从交易额多少来计算成绩的任务观点，反复说明了以给农民解决多少问题为衡量成绩的标准。会后，商业厅一些处长又和到会的干部个别交换了意见，发现有些干部在思想上、作法上仍有不够明确的地方，他们又分别以小专题作了研究和总结。到会的干部满意地说：“反官僚主义真起了作用；这次开会变了样，有方针、有政策、有办法。”
    第二，加强了领导干部的群众观念。过去山东省级机关不少领导干部群众观念薄弱，不关心群众疾苦。突出地表现在大批积压人民来信，对群众的困难漠不关心。山东合作总社在去年推销化学肥料、农具等生产资料时，三月份就发现下层干部有强迫命令现象，之后又陆续发现，但合作总社对这种现象只停留在通报上；直到莱阳县逼死人命，才派人调查处理。在这次反官僚主义斗争中，通过检查群众观念，揭发因漠视群众利益和疾苦而造成损失、损害了党的政策和政府威信的严重事实，引起了许多领导干部的思想转变。主要表现在对处理人民来信来访的工作有了很大的改进。不久以前，山东大众日报把德州实业公司读者范凌反映该地农具制造厂因供料问题没法解决，影响了生产的来信转给山东省人民政府财政厅。财政厅负责干部接信后，立即责成该厅所属供应处调查解决，很快就把农具制造厂第一季度所需的二千余吨铁的供应问题解决了。惠民专区阳信县八里泊、郝家村两个农民，二月十九日到山东省人民政府反映当地政府在查田定产和征粮减免工作中，没有照顾这两个村过去遭受战争创伤和水旱灾的情况。财政厅长张耀曾知道后就和农税处副处长亲自商谈。他们一方面请示省府，和电告惠民专署调查处理；另一方面又马上派遣得力干部协同惠民专署、阳信县人民政府组成九个人的调查组，作了具体调查。除解决了八里泊、郝家村的减免问题外，对周围有类似情况的村庄也作了适当减免。
    第三，加强了集中领导，初步克服了“政出多门”的分散现象。山东省人民政府在一九五三年工作纲要中，统一了省府各厅、局及各级人民政府的工作步调，对省府各单位召开的全省性的会议及向下面发的公文也加以控制，取消了处一级的向下发文权（可通报介绍经验）。由于加强了集中领导和强调执行请示报告制度，最近一个月中减少了百分之八十的会议，向下发文也减少了一大半，同时，防止了当前工作中可能产生的新的官僚主义和命令主义。如农林厅准备在农忙的三月份召开九个专业会议，已被省府及时制止。农林厅的林业局笼统指示全省打松毛虫，但事前没有弄清全省那里有松毛虫，有多大地面发生松毛虫，有松毛虫的树是公有还是私有，组织群众打松毛虫有无代价等情况，这一指示也被省府及时纠正了。
    第四，打开了批评和自我批评特别是自下而上的批评之门，初步树立了民主制度，加强了党内外的民主生活和群众对领导的监督作用，打下了以后继续进行反官僚主义斗争的基础。山东省一级机关，过去很缺乏批评和自我批评特别是自下而上的批评的空气。有些作风恶劣的领导干部，还压制批评和打击批评者。如文教厅长王哲曾用隐蔽的办法打击批评者；也有的领导干部用对笔迹的办法追查写批评信的人，并给批评者扣无组织无纪律的帽子，因此许多干部对批评领导者有很多顾虑。他们怕“穿小鞋”、怕“记一笔账”、怕“开酱油铺”（即对批评者的缺点加油加醋夸大其事，以图报复）。这次开展反官僚主义斗争，锋芒首先针对了压制批评者，给干部撑了腰。特别是黄逸峰事件公布后，一般干部都看到党在那里支持着他们，于是都大胆地展开了批评。山东省合作总社的干部，针对该社的领导工作提了二千多条意见。仅该社供应处干部就提了三百多条。商业厅领导干部注意了批评意见，使件件有着落，对一般干部的鼓舞作用很大。过去省直属机关党委会出版的“学习生活”小报，很少刊载批评稿件，现在批评稿件占了大量篇幅。中共中央山东分局、山东省人民政府、省直属机关党委会，经常收到下级干部的批评意见。经过这次检查，山东省人民政府大部分厅、局已订出了会议汇报制度、检查工作和民主监督制度，有些单位已开始执行向机关工作人员定期报告工作的制度。
    山东省级机关这次反官僚主义斗争所以能取得成绩，主要由于：
    第一，贯彻了中共中央山东分局所提出的“边反边防边建”的方针，紧紧地围绕着当前工作，抓住主要工作中的主要问题，特别是带有政策性的问题，进行检查、分析和批判。如工业厅检查了基本建设中的盲目性和企业管理上不依靠工人的错误思想；交通厅检查了航务工作的主观冒进、基本建设中的本末倒置、运输工作上的强迫命令违犯政策；合作总社检查了不计成本、心中无数的供给制思想。这就打中了官僚主义者的要害，避免了与当前工作关系较少的泛泛的检查。一面检查一面改进的办法，避免了在当前工作中犯新的官僚主义，使反官僚主义的斗争立即产生效果。
    第二，采取了自上而下检查和自下而上批评相结合的办法。山东省级机关这次反官僚主义斗争，是在学习马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中开展起来的。大家思想上早有准备。经过逐级动员，讲清此次反官僚主义的方针、政策与具体作法，群众很快就酝酿起来，这时领导干部一面虚心作自我检查，一面发动群众提意见，自下而上深入检查，这就使主要问题很快弄清，避免了影响当前工作的旷日持久的检讨。
    第三，从重点事到重点人。开始先从检查工作入手，经过揭发、分析、批判工作中的错误，然后再追查到人的责任。这样就会避免一开始就纠缠在人的身上、使斗争不能顺利发展的偏差。
    山东省级机关这次反官僚主义斗争也还有缺点，主要是各机关的斗争发展不够平衡，有些机关的领导干部，因缺乏批评和自我批评的精神，迟迟不作检讨。如文教厅长王哲，一开始人家就发现了他的错误严重，但王哲却采取了拖的态度。这就影响了该机关反官僚主义斗争的开展。
    另外，个别负责干部经过检查批评之后，产生了消极情绪，对工作不敢大胆负责，对机关建设采取了观望态度。有些干部则以为斗争快结束了，产生了麻痹思想，因之个别机关在工作中仍有官僚主义。这种情况已引起山东省领导方面的注意，正纠正中。
