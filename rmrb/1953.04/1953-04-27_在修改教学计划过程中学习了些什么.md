What I Learned in the Process of Revising the Teaching Plan
Zhang Wei, Director of the Civil Engineering Department of Tsinghua University

    When formulating the teaching plan last year, due to a lack of understanding of the spirit of the Soviet teaching plan and the content and interrelationships of the various courses, we mechanically reduced the Soviet five-year teaching plan to our four-year teaching plan. For courses that we were unable to offer, the number of hours was reduced even further. However, the purpose of our doing this was not very clear. We also did not clearly determine the order of the courses. For example, the course "Construction Technology" should have been studied first, so that there would be conditions for learning "Construction Production Organization and Planning" later. However, because we were not sure about offering the "Construction Technology" course, we postponed it and placed it in the same semester as "Construction Production Organization and Planning." Furthermore, because of our insufficient understanding of the integrity of the teaching plan, we also held old views on production practice, treating it as an appendage to teaching. In addition, our understanding of the interrelationships of the teaching plan was also insufficient. For example, when other departments offered a course in thermodynamics for our department and consulted us for our opinions on the teaching syllabus, we found it difficult to offer opinions on which courses this course should lay the foundation for. There are many such examples.
    As a result of teaching based on such a teaching plan, students reflected that the workload was too heavy not long after the start of the semester last semester. At this time, we realized that when formulating the teaching plan, teaching syllabus, and preparing teaching materials, we had not considered the differences between the level of our students and the level of Soviet students. At the same time, we did not notice that students in 1951-1952 had participated in political movements relatively frequently and their professional studies were poor. The knowledge they had already learned was not solid enough. If the teaching volume was too heavy, learning achievements could not be consolidated.
    In response to this situation, we began to revise the teaching plan under the leadership of the school administration. At that time, because we only saw the superficial phenomenon that students did not have enough time for self-study, when we started to revise the teaching plan, we focused on the number of class hours per week, hoping to increase students' self-study time by reducing the weekly class hours. And we self-righteously determined three principles: (1) Reduce weekly class hours. (2) Reduce the number of courses per semester and remove courses that are not easy to offer or that we subjectively consider not very important. (3) For the courses in the fifth, sixth, and seventh semesters, because we are not sure, we don't need to consider too much. As for whether or not a graduation thesis is needed, it is a problem for later and does not need to be studied for the time being. As a result of implementing these three principles, the number of weekly class hours in each semester was generally reduced from thirty-five or six hours to thirty-two or three hours. At that time, we were satisfied with this approach.
    However, after Soviet experts read the revised teaching plan, they gave us many opinions, proving that the three principles we proposed were wrong. From then on, our work on revising the teaching plan was carried out under the direct guidance of Soviet experts. In the process of working with Soviet experts, we gained a new understanding of the teaching plan:
        (1) The Purpose and Integrity of the Teaching Plan: The teaching plan is subordinate to the training objectives. In the past, we did not understand this clearly enough, because we were not clear about the training objectives. The teaching plan is composed of five parts: theoretical study, examination, production practice, graduation thesis, and vacation. In the past, we paid too much attention to theoretical study. When mentioning the teaching plan, we often only thought of issues related to lectures. As for production practice, it has not been given a legitimate status in the past; even after the reform of the school system, we have not given it due importance. Regarding the graduation thesis, we did not realize that this is a grand summary of four years of study, thinking that it was just giving students more opportunities to do a larger-scale design. Now it seems that without a graduation thesis design, the knowledge students have learned in four years cannot be integrated and used to deal with the entire engineering problem. In this way, each course can only be a fragmented piece of knowledge for him. Students will naturally find it difficult to solve problems independently after leaving school. Because the courses in the school are like the various parts of a house: doors, windows, bricks, tiles, frames, etc. Although students already know each individual component, how to put the components together into a house can only be achieved through the graduation thesis. After completing the graduation thesis, students can analyze the entire engineering problem into individual technical problems (foundation, frame structure, building, etc.) in actual work, solve them one by one, and then combine them into one project. When we discussed the teaching plan, some comrades believed that since we did not know how to do the graduation thesis, it would be better to simply cancel it. This reflects the escapist thinking of some teachers. Soviet experts pointed out the position of the graduation thesis to us and emphasized that it is better to reduce some theoretical study than to do a graduation thesis design.
    Regarding examinations and vacations, we did not realize in the past that they are indispensable parts of the student training process; so we have never paid attention to studying how long they should take.
    The interrelationships and proportions of these five components are specifically reflected in the teaching schedule. This schedule clearly illustrates the integrity of the teaching plan. And this integrity is subordinate to the overall training objectives. This goal is to cultivate engineers with a certain level of political thought and scientific and technological level, with independent work and creative abilities, and who integrate theory with practice.
    (2) Pay attention to cultivating students' creativity. In the past, schools completely ignored this point. Teachers taught students how much, and students accepted how much. After students left school, they did not know how to use the basic knowledge they had learned to solve new problems encountered in their work, but only complained that the teacher had not taught him more knowledge. The teacher wanted to teach the students into an encyclopedia, and the students also hoped to be an encyclopedia as soon as they left school. Some teachers were not completely unaware of the importance of cultivating students' independent thinking ability, but they did not know how to do it, often only emphasizing self-study and writing papers. They thought that a student who could write a paper meant that he had independent thinking ability. They did not know that the formation of students' independent thinking ability is a planned training process, and the teaching plan should reflect such a training process. According to Soviet experts, in the Soviet Union, first-year university students are also unable to work independently. When doing the first course design, the teacher tells him what to do, and he does it. But when doing the graduation thesis design, he will raise many opinions and argue with the teacher. Therefore, cultivating students' independent working ability cannot be achieved solely by increasing their self-study time. In the early stages of university, centralized tutoring is a better way to help students digest lecture content and solve exercises. This can not only improve students' learning efficiency, but also make it easier for teachers to grasp students' thinking and better help students. Through a series of teaching methods such as lectures, doing exercises, tutoring, experiments, examinations, and production practice, by the time of the third year, students' thinking ability has improved, and the designed courses are gradually increasing. At that time, they should be given more time and opportunities for independent thinking. In the seventh semester, they should be let go and let them read more reference books and do independent design. How to specifically reflect this policy in the teaching plan? In this revised teaching plan, we gradually reduced the weekly class hours from thirty-six hours in the first semester to thirty hours in the seventh semester. What is the difference between the thirty-six hours in the first few semesters and the thirty-six hours in the past plan? The difference is that there was too much lecture time and less tutoring in the past; while in the current thirty-six hours, lectures only take about sixteen hours, which increases the tutoring time for basic courses (mathematics, physics, etc.). In the final semester, there are many course designs. Not only is the lecture time shorter, but it is best to arrange the timetable in the future so that students have no classes at all on one day, so that they can spend the whole day in the drawing classroom doing design. In this way, they will not waste all their time on organizing drawing paper.
    Of course, to cultivate students' independent thinking ability and creativity, it is not enough to only pay attention to the arrangement of weekly hours in the teaching plan. In formulating the teaching syllabus, in using Soviet teaching methods, in course design and examinations, this policy must be implemented throughout. The graduation thesis design is the last and best opportunity to test students' independent working ability.
        (3) Equal Emphasis on Theory and Practice. Our national construction cause requires university graduate engineers to creatively solve problems in practical work. In the past, our country's education was colonial and semi-colonial education, and engineering education was no exception. Imperialists will not allow us to have independent construction capabilities, and coupled with the legacy of feudal scholar-official education, the education of engineering colleges in the past made a serious mistake of being divorced from reality. However, in the Soviet teaching plan, theoretical learning and practical work are very closely integrated. In our revised teaching plan, after the end of the first year of study, students have three weeks of teaching practice, and the content of the practice is surveying - the most basic course in the civil engineering department. After the end of the second year, there are four weeks of production practice, requiring students to have a preliminary understanding of the scope and nature of the work of the major through on-site practice. In the production practice during the third summer vacation, students will participate in on-site work in the position of trainee engineers. They will not only work with workers, but also put forward suggestions for improvement on design and construction. Before the final graduation thesis, there are five weeks of practice to go to the business departments to collect actual data for writing the graduation thesis. After such four practices, students will be able to verify the theoretical knowledge learned in each stage with the professional practice. The requirements for practice are also from shallow to deep, from low to high. Engineers trained in this way will not be divorced from reality in terms of ideology or business.
    The above are just some preliminary understandings of the Soviet teaching plan that I have gained when revising the teaching plan with Soviet experts. The Soviet Union has thirty-five years of advanced socialist construction experience. The Soviet education meets the requirements of socialist countries. Chairman Mao called on us to learn from the Soviet Union. Learning from the Soviet Union cannot be done formally and mechanically. The Soviet school system is essentially different from the school system of capitalist countries. We have only just begun to reform the school system. We do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the spirit of the Soviet school system. However, we believe that in future work and study, we will gradually recognize the essence and spirit of the Soviet school system and apply it to our cause of cultivating talents.

    在修改教学计划过程中学习了些什么
    清华大学土木系主任  张维
    在去年制订教学计划时，由于不瞭解苏联教学计划的精神，不瞭解各课程的内容及其相互关系，我们机械地把苏联五年制的教学计划缩减成我们的四年制的教学计划，对于我们不能开的课程，其时数就减少得更多些。但是，我们这样作的目的性是不太明确的。对于各门课的前后次序也没有明白地确定下来。例如建筑施工技术这门课程，本来应当先学，这样才有条件在以后来学建筑生产组织及计划这门课程；但是因为我们没有把握开设建筑施工技术课，就把它推在后面，和建筑生产组织及计划这门课程放在同一学期。又因为对于教学计划的整体性认识得很不够，我们对生产实习也抱着旧的看法，把它当作了教学的附属部分。此外，对于教学计划的相互关联性也瞭解得不够。例如外系为我系开了热工学的课程，当他们征询我们对这门课程的教学大纲的意见时，我们就难提出这门课究竟要为什么课程打基础的意见。诸如此类的例子是很多的。
    根据这样的教学计划进行教学的结果，上学期开学不久，同学们就反映功课太重。这时我们才觉察到，在拟定教学计划、教学大纲及准备教材时，并未考虑到我们学生的水平和苏联学生的水平的差别，同时也没有注意到，在一九五一——五二年间同学因参加政治运动比较多，业务学习较差，已学得的知识也不够巩固，如果教学分量过重，学习成绩是不可能巩固的。
    针对这种情况，我们便在学校行政方面的领导下，开始了修改教学计划的工作。当时因为我们只看到同学们自学时间不够这一表面现象，所以在动手修订教学计划时，就着眼在每周的上课时数，想用减少上课的周小时数的办法，增加同学们的自学时间。并且自以为是地确定了三项原则：（一）减少上课周小时。（二）减少每学期的课程门数，把不容易开的课程或我们主观上认为不甚重要的课去掉。（三）对于第五、第六、第七学期的课程，因没有把握，可以不必多考虑。至于毕业论文是否需要做，是以后的问题，暂时不必研究。执行这三项原则的结果，各学期的上课周小时数普遍由三十五六小时减到三十二三小时。当时对于这种做法，我们是满意的。
    但苏联专家看了这样修改的教学计划以后，却给我们提出了许多意见，证明我们提出的三项原则是错了。从这以后，我们修订教学计划的工作，就在苏联专家的直接指导下进行了。在和苏联专家共同工作的过程中，我们对于教学计划有了新的认识：
        （一）教学计划的目的性和整体性：教学计划是服从于培养目标的，过去，我们对这一点认识得不够清楚，因为我们对培养目标就弄不清楚。教学计划是由理论学习、考试、生产实习、毕业论文同假期五个部分组成的。过去，我们过分地注意了理论学习。提到教学计划，我们常常只是想到有关讲课的问题。至于生产实习，在过去一直没有给它以合法的地位；就是在学制改革以后，我们也还未给以应有的重视。对于毕业论文，我们也没有体会到这是四年学习的大总结，认为只不过是给学生更多的机会做一个较大规模的设计而已。现在看来，如果没有毕业论文设计，学生在四年之内所学到的知识就不能融会贯通，并运用这些知识来处理整个工程问题。这样，每门课对于他只能是一些支离破碎的知识。学生出校以后自然很难独立解决问题。因为学校里的各门课，就好像一个房子的各部分：门窗、砖瓦、房架等等。对于每一个个别构件，学生虽然已经知道，但如何把各构件拼成一个房子，却只有通过毕业论文才能达到。在作过毕业论文后，学生才能在实际工作中把整个工程问题分析成个别技术问题（基础、房架结构，建筑等问题），一一加以解决，再合在一起成为一件工程。在我们讨论教学计划时，有些同志认为，既然我们不知道如何做毕业论文，就不如索性取消它。这反映了某些教师逃避困难的思想。苏联专家给我们指出了毕业论文的地位，并且强调宁可减少一些理论学习，也要作毕业论文设计。
    对于考试同假期，我们在过去更没有认识到它是在培养学生过程中不可缺少的部分；所以一直没有注意研究它究竟应当占多长时间。
    这五个组成部分的相互关系同比重，具体地表现在教学进度表中。这进度表很明确地说明了教学计划的整体性。而这个整体性又是服从于总的培养目标的。这个目标就是要培养出具有一定政治思想水平和科学技术水平的、具有独立工作及创造能力的、理论联系实际的工程师。
    （二）注意培养学生的创造能力。过去的学校，是完全不管这点的。先生教给学生多少，学生就接受多少。学生出校以后，在工作中遇到新的问题，就不知道如何运用所学的基本知识去解决它，而只埋怨先生没有教给他更多的知识。先生则想把学生教成一部百科全书，学生也希望一出校门就是一部百科全书。有些先生也并非完全不知道培养同学独立思考能力的重要，却不知道如何做，往往只是强调自学和作论文。他们以为学生能作出一篇论文就表示他有独立思考能力。不知道使一般的同学通过四年的学习，逐渐形成独立思考的能力。他们不懂学生的独立思考能力的形成是个有计划的培养过程，教学计划就应当体现这样一个培养过程。据苏联专家说，在苏联，大学一年级的学生，也是不会独立工作的。在作第一个课程设计时，还是先生叫他作什么，他就作什么。但是到了作毕业论文设计时，他就会提出许多意见和先生争辩了。所以培养同学的独立工作能力，也并非单独靠增加他们的自学时间可以达到的。在大学的初期，集中辅导是帮助同学消化讲课内容、解习题的更好的方式。这不仅可以使同学的学习效率提高，也可以使先生比较容易地掌握同学的思想情况，以便更好地帮助学生。通过讲课、做习题、辅导、实验、考试及生产实习等一系列的教学方式，到了三年级，同学们的思考能力提高了，设计的课程逐渐增加，那时就应当多给他们以独立思考的时间和机会。在第七学期就要放手，让他们多看些参考书，独立作设计。如何把这个方针具体地表现在教学计划中呢？在这次修改过的教学计划中，我们是把每周学时由第一学期的三十六小时逐渐降到第七学期的三十小时。前几学期的三十六小时和过去计划中的三十六小时有什么区别呢？不同的是过去讲授时间太多，辅导少；而现在的三十六小时中讲授只有十六小时左右，这样就增加了基本课程（数学、物理等）的辅导时间。在最后的学期中，课程设计多，不但讲授时间较少，而且在将来排课程表时最好使学生有一天根本无课，以便让他们整日在绘图教室中作设计。这样，他们才不致于把时间全消耗在整理图画纸的工作上。
    自然，要培养同学的独立思考能力和创造能力仅仅注意教学计划中的周小时的安排是不够的，在拟订教学大纲时，在运用苏联的教学方法时，在课程设计和考试当中，全要贯彻这个方针。毕业论文设计则是考验学生的独立工作能力的最后和最好的机会。
        （三）理论和实际并重。我们的国家建设事业，要求大学毕业的工程师能创造性地解决实际工作中的问题。我国过去的教育，是殖民地和半殖民地的教育，工程教育也不能例外。帝国主义者是不会让我们具有独立建设的能力的，再加上过去封建社会士大夫教育所遗留给我们的遗毒，所以过去工学院的教育犯了严重的脱离实际的毛病。但是在苏联的教学计划中，理论学习和实际工作结合得非常密切。在我们修订后的教学计划中，第一年的学习结束以后，学生就有三星期的教学实习，实习的内容是测量——土木系最基本的课程。第二年终了后，又有四个星期的生产实习，要求同学通过现场的实习，对于本专业的工作范围及性质有个初步了解。在第三年暑假的生产实习中，同学们就要以练习工程师的地位到现场参加工作，他们不但要和工人一起工作，并要对设计及施工提出改进意见。在最后作毕业论文前，还有五个星期的实习，以便到业务部门去搜集实际资料写作毕业论文。经过这样的四次实习，同学们就能够把在每个阶段所学的理论知识和专业的实际加以印证。在对实习的要求上，也是由浅入深，由低到高。这样培养出来的工程师，无论在思想上或是在业务上全不会脱离实际。
    上面只是在和苏联专家一起修改教学计划时，对于苏联教学计划所得到的一些初步体会。苏联有着三十五年的社会主义先进建设经验。苏联的教育是符合于社会主义国家的要求的。毛主席号召我们要学习苏联。学习苏联不能形式地、机械地去学习。苏联的学制和资本主义国家的学制在本质上是不同的。我们才开始改革学制。我们对于苏联学制的精神还体会得很不够。但是，我们相信在今后的工作和学习过程中，会逐渐认识到苏联学制的实质同精神，并把它运用到我们培养人材的事业中。
