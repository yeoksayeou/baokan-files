Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st—TASS reported from Moscow on the 1st: The Stalin International Peace Prize Committee for Strengthening Peace Among Nations issued an announcement on the death of Yves Farge. The announcement said: The death of Yves Farge deprives the movement to safeguard and consolidate world peace of one of its greatest and most outstanding representatives, who tirelessly promoted international friendship and understanding and fought for the freedom and independence of all nations. All good men and women around the world and friends of peace in France consider that Farge embodied the best traditions of his country and was a man who deeply understood the interests of all peoples.
    The Soviet Peace Committee also issued an announcement stating: The death of Yves Farge has deprived the friends of peace in all countries around the world of a tireless fighter for consolidating and safeguarding international peace. The Soviet people, along with all friends of peace, express their deep sorrow at the death of Farge and urge all good men and women to unite their ranks more closely to fight against the danger of another world war and to strive for peace. The cause of Yves Farge, the great cause of peace, remains and will triumph.
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet Peace Committee telegraphed the French National Peace Council to express condolences on the death of Yves Farge.
    The telegram said: An accident has taken from our ranks a brave fighter for consolidating international peace and friendship, an extraordinary man, an outstanding son of the French people, and a representative and leader of a powerful force in the peace camp—the French peace movement.
    Good men and women in all countries of the world know that Yves Farge made inestimable contributions to the development of the peace movement of all nations. He was the initiator and active fighter for the movement to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact. He worked selflessly for the victory of the principle of peaceful settlement of all international disputes and resolutely opposed the use of bacteriological weapons in war. His passionate speeches advocating peace and opposing the preparation for another war resonated throughout numerous world and regional peace conferences. Yves Farge loved his country and the peace-loving people of France. On the day he accepted the Stalin International Prize, he said: "At this moment, I think of the French peace advocates, of the most ordinary workers, and of the most outstanding leaders, who have made great sacrifices in our peace committees, in various enterprises, institutions, universities, cities, and villages to oppose deception and hatred..."
    The Soviet people know that Yves Farge was their best friend and a sincere advocate of Soviet-French friendship. The Soviet people will always remember his brilliant image. They will do everything in their power to work for the sacred cause of safeguarding and consolidating international peace.
    The telegram was signed by Fadeyev, Tikhonov, Ehrenburg, Korneichuk, Simonov, Nesmeyanov, Surkov, Grekov, Gerasimov, Popova, Kotov, Dumanova, and Kochemasov.
     Xinhua News Agency, 1st: After learning of the unfortunate death of the outstanding peace fighter Yves Farge, five national people's organizations in our country sent telegrams to the French National Peace Council to express their deep condolences.
    The telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: Mr. Farge was a good friend of the Chinese people. He visited China for the cause of peace, and his name is dear to the Chinese workers and working people. He was not only an active defender of French national independence, democracy, and freedom and the leader of the French peace movement, but also an outstanding fighter for the international peace cause. His death is undoubtedly a great loss to the French and world peace movements. But all peace-loving people in the world will unite more closely and strive to continue to promote the cause of defending world peace to which he dedicated himself.
    The telegram from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation said: We Chinese women are willing to unite more closely with peace-loving French women and fight to the end for the cause of defending world peace to which Mr. Farge devoted himself. Please convey our deep condolences to Mrs. Farge.
    The telegram from the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth said: The death of Mr. Farge is a great loss to the cause of defending world peace. Chinese youth will learn from his spirit of loyalty and dedication to the cause of peace and work better with peace-loving youth and people all over the world to strive for the lasting peace of all mankind.
    The telegram from the All-China Students' Federation said: The death of Mr. Farge has deprived Chinese students of a close friend and deprived the cause of defending world peace of an outstanding fighter. Chinese students, like the Chinese people, will unite more closely with the peace-loving French people and with the peace-loving and just people of the world to fight for the defense of world peace.
    Mao Dun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, expressed condolences on behalf of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles on the death of Farge. Mao Dun's telegram said: Mr. Farge was an outstanding fighter for the world peace movement, a dear friend of the people of the world and the Chinese people. His death is a great loss to the cause of defending world peace. Mr. Farge visited our country last May, and the Chinese people have a very deep impression of his spirit of loving the just cause of the Chinese people. We believe that he is a symbol of the friendship between the Chinese and French peoples, and therefore we share the same sorrow with the French people for his unfortunate death. We believe that, at this time when we have lost an outstanding peace fighter, the Chinese people, the French people, and the peace-loving people of the world will continue to unite more and more and strive to defend peace.
