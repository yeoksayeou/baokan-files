The Nanchong Special District Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law in Sichuan Province held a meeting on March 18th. Based on the province's instructions and the three different situations of the Marriage Law implementation movement in the entire special district, it specifically deployed the work for the concluding stage.

The first type of area: These areas have vigorously organized publicity efforts, conducted extensive propaganda, and the vast majority of the masses have received education on the Marriage Law. Some mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and couples who previously had poor relationships have voluntarily reconciled. Only a very small number of people still do not have a sufficient understanding of the Marriage Law. These areas have indeed grasped the problems that need to be actively resolved. According to statistics from six counties, there are 116 townships and 64 villages in this category. In Peng'an County, such villages account for 44.3% of the total number of villages in the county. In the concluding stage, these areas will specifically carry out the following work: (1) Township and village cadres and activists meetings will be held to summarize achievements, prevent complacency, further enhance the understanding of cadres, and emphasize doing a good job in the regular work of implementing the Marriage Law. (2) For issues raised by the masses during the movement that have not yet been dealt with, they should be handled correctly in accordance with the provisions of the Supplementary Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, ensuring that each matter is addressed. Serious criminals who have violated the Marriage Law as revealed by the masses should be actively investigated and handed over to the court for punishment in accordance with the law. (3) Rectify and improve the organizations of township and village women's representative conferences, establish a meeting reporting system, and make them a powerful pillar that regularly supports women in their struggle against the feudal marriage system. Appropriate adjustments should be made to individual organizations that have become disorganized and weak. (4) Establish and carefully inspect the marriage registration system, overcoming the laissez-faire phenomenon in past marriage registration work. (5) The township government will hold a meeting once a month to review the implementation of the Marriage Law, with the participation of cadres from the Communist Youth League, women's representative conferences, and the main cadres of the village to report, study, and arrange work, and to discover problems and correct errors and shortcomings in the work in a timely manner.

The second type of area: A considerable part of the masses have not grasped the spirit of the Marriage Law, a small part of the masses have not received education on the Marriage Law, and most of the disharmonious couples and mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationships have not been improved. The masses still cannot resolve family relationships on their own, and they have not grasped the serious problems that need to be actively addressed. According to statistics from six counties, there are 251 townships and 113 villages in this category. In Peng'an County, such villages account for approximately 34.7% of the total number of townships and villages in the county. In the concluding stage of the movement, these areas should combine in-depth propaganda of policies with handling individual serious issues, commend good couples, families, and cadres; at the same time, continue to conduct propaganda targeting the ideological concerns of the masses, using mutual aid teams as units (absorbing individual households); and establish necessary regular work systems on the basis of universal propaganda.

The third type of area: Policies have not been communicated, cadres' ideological understanding is not clear, the movement has not been launched, and the Marriage Law has not met the masses; or, although the movement has been launched, there are deviations in the approach, such as mobilizing the masses to complain about their suffering, forming struggles, confessions, and arbitrarily punishing people, resulting in ideological confusion among the masses. According to statistics from nine districts in six counties, there are four townships and 202 villages in this category. In the concluding stage of the movement, these areas must combine with production to conduct supplementary lessons and continue to carry out propaganda to the masses, and must not be perfunctory. In areas where propaganda and practices have been erroneous, causing misconceptions and fears among the masses, the district and township should systematically and publicly explain the errors to the masses and correct their understanding. However, in general, do not excessively blame a certain cadre or order them to make public self-criticisms.

Based on the above situation, the Nanchong Special District Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law also stipulated: When all areas conclude the movement, the county must be approved by the prefectural committee, the district must be approved by the county committee, and the township must obtain the consent of the district. Summaries should be made on the basis of townships, according to the above three categories, and reported level by level. When districts and counties summarize, they must specifically study the achievements and shortcomings of the movement and the existing problems, and deploy the main practices for transitioning to regular work in the future.

    南充专区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会根据不同地区情况布置结束运动的步骤
    四川省南充专区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在三月十八日开会，根据省的指示和全专区贯彻婚姻法运动三种不同情况的地区，具体布置了结束阶段的工作。
    第一类地区：大力组织了宣传力量，进行了广泛宣传，绝大部分群众已受到婚姻法教育，部分过去关系不好的婆媳、夫妻已自愿和好，只有极少数群众对婚姻法的认识还不够。这类地区已确实掌握了需要主动解决的问题。据六个县的统计，这类地区有一百一十六个乡和六十四个村；蓬安县这类村可占到全县村数的百分之四十四点三。这类地区在结束阶段具体进行以下工作：（一）乡、村召开干部和积极分子会议，总结成绩，防止自满情绪，进一步提高干部认识，并强调做好贯彻婚姻法的经常工作。（二）对于群众在运动中提出来尚未处理的问题，应按中共中央补充指示的规定，正确处理，做到件件有交代。对群众揭发出来的严重违犯婚姻法的罪恶分子，应主动予以检查，送交法院依法惩处。（三）整顿和健全乡、村妇女代表会组织，建立会议汇报制度，使其成为经常支持妇女向封建婚姻制度作斗争的有力支柱。对个别已经涣散无力的组织，应加以适当的调整。（四）建立和认真检查婚姻登记制度，克服过去婚姻登记工作中的放任自流现象。（五）乡政府每月召开一次检查婚姻法执行情况的会议，吸收青年团、妇女代表会的干部及村的主要干部参加，进行汇报、研究，布置工作，发现问题，及时纠正工作中的错误和缺点。
    第二类地区：有相当部分群众没有领会婚姻法的精神，少部分群众没有受到婚姻法的教育，大部分不和睦的夫妻、婆媳关系尚未得到改善；群众还不能自行解决家庭关系，对需要主动处理的严重问题未掌握住。根据六个县的统计，这类地区有二百五十一个乡和一百一十三个村；在蓬安县，这类村约占全县乡和村数的百分之三十四点七。在运动结束阶段，这类地区应在深入宣传政策的前提下结合处理个别严重问题，表扬好的夫妻、家庭、干部；同时以互助组为单位（吸收单干户参加），针对群众思想顾虑，继续进行宣传；并在普遍宣传的基础上，建立必要的经常工作制度。
    第三类地区：政策没有交代下去，干部思想认识不明确，运动没有展开，婚姻法还没和群众见面；或者虽然展开了运动，但在作法上有偏差，如发动群众诉苦，形成斗争、坦白、随便处罚人等，群众思想混乱。据六个县九个区的统计，这类地区有四个乡和二百零二个村。在运动结束阶段，这类地区必须结合生产进行补课，继续向群众进行宣传，不得潦草从事。在宣传和作法上有错误而引起群众错觉和恐惧的地区，区、乡应有计划地公开向群众说明错误，端正认识。但一般的不要过份责怪某个干部或令其公开检讨。
    根据以上情况，南充专区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会又规定：所有地区结束运动时，县必须经地委批准，区必须经县委批准，乡要取得区的同意。并以乡为单位，按以上三类的标准进行总结，逐级上报。区和县总结时，要具体研究运动的成果、缺点及存在的问题，布置今后转入经常工作的主要作法。
