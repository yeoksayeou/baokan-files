In Memory of the Great Peace Warrior—Mr. Yves Farge
廖盖隆

The glorious son of the French people, the great warrior for the cause of world peace, and the dear friend of the Chinese people, Mr. Yves Farge, has passed away due to an unexpected car accident on March 30th.

Mr. Yves Farge was a progressive leader of France and a passionate French patriot who dedicated his life to the glorious cause of defending France's honor and freedom. During the years of France's occupation by Hitler, he founded the first guerrilla force of French patriots—the "Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP)"—and waged a heroic struggle against the German occupiers and French traitors. After World War II, Yves Farge stood with the French people, fighting tirelessly for France's national independence and its withdrawal from the shameful Atlantic aggressive alliance. Yves Farge was also an outstanding warrior for the cause of world peace. In the post-war years, he was consistently a leader of French national peace organizations and a permanent member of the World Peace Council. He actively participated in all World Peace Congresses and World Peace Council meetings. Due to his outstanding contributions to the international peace cause, he was greatly honored as a recipient of the 1952 Stalin International Peace Prize for "Strengthening International Peace."

I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Farge last May, when he was invited by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace to participate in the commemoration of the world's four great cultural figures. He was preparing to go to Northeast China and Korea to investigate the factual evidence of American bacteriological warfare. At that time, I was entrusted by the Peace Committee to accompany Mr. Farge and another French friend, the French poet Claude Roy, on a visit to Northeast China and Korea. Mr. Farge's on-the-spot investigation and his analysis and research of the factual evidence of American bacteriological warfare in Beijing played a significant role in revealing the truth about America's germ warfare. Based on the results of that investigation and research, Mr. Farge successively published "Record of Conversations with American Air Force Prisoner of War Quinn" and many other articles; after returning to France, he wrote "Evidence Seen in China and Korea." These works created an extremely profound impression in French and European public opinion. His report on "Bacteriological Warfare and the Korean War and Their International Consequences" at the World Peace Council's special meeting in Berlin last July further stirred the hearts of millions of peace supporters.

When Mr. Farge was preparing to depart for Korea, he had just recovered a little from a foot ailment, and it happened that the reactionary government of Pinay in France arrested Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and searched the French Peace Council. We were extremely concerned about the reactionary incident that occurred in France at that time and the safety of Comrade Duclos. We all felt that perhaps Mr. Farge would temporarily change his plan to visit Korea. However, Mr. Farge did not do so. Naturally, he was extremely concerned about the deterioration of the French political situation at that time, and he repeatedly asked me to tell him the news from France in detail. But that incident not only did not change, but accelerated his plan to visit Korea. He told us that the Pinay government's arrest of Duclos and other French patriots was clearly due to the surge of indignant protests by honest people in France against the American government's germ warfare. This righteous action of the French people greatly embarrassed the American government, which was responsible for the germ warfare, so they ordered the Pinay government to use bloody means to suppress this humanitarian act. Yves Farge demonstrated his fearless spirit, his overwhelming sense of justice, and his fiery enthusiasm for struggle during those days when the American and French reactionaries were arrogant. He said that he wanted to return to his homeland as soon as possible to expose the truth about bacteriological warfare. He said that he was fully prepared to go to jail in France for the sake of truth, for the sake of justice, and for the sake of peace. He believed that precisely for this reason, he should collect as much detailed factual evidence as possible about America's germ warfare. He told us that he had already collected factual evidence in Beijing sufficient to prove that germ warfare was indeed being carried out, but he wanted to collect more, more detailed, and more direct evidence.

On June 1st, we set off from Beijing. We only made a short stay in Northeast China and then left for Korea. On the road to and from Korea, we were often harassed by American planes, which dropped flares, strafed, and bombed. More than once, bombs fell very close to us. But Yves Farge didn't care about these things at all, he said: "I don't care about air raids, because I've experienced them and I've fought." On the road to and from, our car often drove very fast, often bumping very hard, and once we even encountered torrential rain, and our clothes were soaked by the rain leaking from the car roof. But at this time, Yves Farge didn't frown at all, but with his typical southern French hearty personality, told many interesting and funny things. Because of Yves Farge's participation, our trip was extremely pleasant.

Yves Farge's serious and passionate spirit in the pursuit of truth is unforgettable. He always started working immediately upon arriving at a place, and he didn't want to let any hour pass idly. In Pyongyang, he had extremely detailed conversations with all kinds of witnesses who could prove that the United States was conducting bacteriological warfare, including the Minister of Health and the Deputy Minister of Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Chinese and Korean scientific experts, Volunteer Army soldiers, families of Korean victims, and even Korean and Chinese agents airdropped by the United States. He carefully examined various exhibits and the results of scientific experiments, and went directly to the sites that had been attacked by American bacteriological attacks for on-the-spot investigations. He raised various questions to the witnesses that could possibly negate the existence of these facts, in order to distinguish right from wrong and truth from falsehood. He personally made detailed records of each conversation and each on-the-spot investigation. After returning to his residence every day, he seriously sorted out his notes. Later, his conversations with American prisoners of war Quinn, Enak, and Blanc in the prisoner of war camp in North Korea, as well as his work in Northeast China, were the same. The earliest two articles he published about this field investigation and visit were written on the road, one of which was written on the train from Shenyang to Beijing. From this, we can see Yves Farge's serious and hardworking spirit.

Yves Farge was a dear friend of the Chinese people. He protested in a huge voice against the inhumane bacteriological warfare waged by the American government against the people of Korea and China. He declared: "Bacteriological warfare is a challenge to civilization." His righteous protest received a huge response all over the world, especially in Europe. This courageous action of Yves Farge towards the people of our country and towards the cause of world peace and justice will never be forgotten by the people of our country.

In his recent works, Yves Farge repeatedly expressed the warm friendship of progressive intellectuals and working people in France towards the Chinese people. There is no doubt that this friendship will be increasingly promoted. Our people also give the glorious French people, who have the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, the same warm friendship. This dear friendship of our people towards the brotherly people of France was massively embodied in the rallies and demonstrations of millions of people in major cities across the country in May and June last year to protest against the reactionary French government's arrest of Comrade Duclos. This was personally witnessed by Mr. Yves Farge and made him infinitely moved. Mr. Yves Farge told me: He hopes to come to China again in the future, and he believes that China will become more beautiful and happier at that time. He also told me: He firmly believes that the French people will learn from the example of the Chinese people and strive for their own independence and liberation. In an article he wrote in Beijing on May 2nd last year, "The French People Fight for Peace" (published on page 4 of this newspaper on May 10, 1952), he wrote with enthusiasm: "The new situation of the French peace struggle is linked to its great revolutionary tradition, which once enabled us to seize the right opportunity to prepare for the overthrow of the monarchy. When the people and the middle class were compiling 'grievance books,' they were actually engaged in the preparation for the French Revolution. "Sometimes, people say to us: 'Let France remain as it is, because this "old country" is after all a beautiful country.' My answer is: There is no old country, when the power of the people is liberated, all countries will become very young again. "Speaking of this, I want to talk about the greatest memorial I saw with my own eyes in Beijing that I will never forget—the 'May Day' festival in 1952. You not only gave the land to the peasants, gave justice to the working class, and made your country independent; you also gave the young people the right and enthusiasm to perform the Yangko dance." "The Yangko dance is like our French quadrille, which is also danced hand in hand. In the various districts and villages of our big cities, there are also many beautiful squares waiting for our happiness-loving people to sing and dance there. Our republic's ancestors planted elm trees and linden trees in these squares for the next generation, and they called these trees 'trees of freedom'." Mr. Yves Farge's beautiful hopes will surely become great realities. The French people will surely inherit the just cause of defending France's independence and freedom and defending peace to which he dedicated his life. Peace-loving people all over the world will surely remember the brilliant image of this loyal peace warrior forever and strengthen their own just struggle.

    悼伟大的和平战士——伊夫·法奇先生
    廖盖隆
    法兰西人民的光荣的儿子、世界和平事业的伟大战士、中国人民的亲爱的朋友伊夫·法奇先生，因汽车失事的意外事件，已于三月三十日与我们永别了。
    伊夫·法奇先生，是法国的进步领袖，是法国的热情的爱国者，他把他的一生献给了保卫法国的荣誉和自由的光荣事业。在法国被希特勒占领的年代里，他创立了第一支法国爱国者的游击队——“范谷尔游击队”，对德国占领者和法国的卖国贼进行了英勇的斗争。在第二次世界大战后，伊夫·法奇又和法国人民在一起，为法国的民族独立、为法国退出可耻的大西洋侵略联盟而进行了坚持不懈的斗争。伊夫·法奇又是世界和平事业的卓越战士。在战后年代里，他一直是法国全国和平组织的领袖，并且一直是世界和平理事会的常务委员。他积极地参加了历次的世界和平大会和世界和平理事会。由于他对国际和平事业的卓越贡献，他获得了一九五二年度“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖者的极大光荣。
    我得有机会和法奇先生认识，是在去年五月间，当法奇先生应中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的邀请来我国参加世界四大文化名人纪念会之后，正准备到我国东北及朝鲜调查美国细菌战的事实证据的时候。那时我受到和平委员会的嘱托陪同法奇先生和另一位法国朋友、法国的诗人柯莱德·罗阿先生去东北及朝鲜进行访问。法奇先生的那次实地调查，和他在北京期间对于美国进行细菌战的事实证据的分析和研究，对于揭露美国进行细菌战的事实真相，起了很大的作用。根据那次调查和研究的结果，法奇先生先后发表了“与美国空军战俘奎恩的谈话纪录”以及其他许多文章；回到法国以后，他又写成了“在中国和朝鲜看到的证据”一书。这些著作在法国以及在欧洲的舆论界都造成了极为深刻的印象。去年七月间他在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议上所作的“关于细菌战和朝鲜战争以及两者在国际上的后果”的报告，更激动了千百万和平拥护者的心弦。
    当法奇先生准备出发到朝鲜去的时候，他患了足疾刚才好了一点，又刚好碰到法国国内发生了比内反动政府逮捕法共中央委员会书记杜克洛并搜查法国的和平理事会的事件。我们都极为关切当时法国所发生的那次反动事变和杜克洛同志的安全，我们都觉得也许法奇先生要临时改变他的访问朝鲜的计划。然而法奇先生并不这样。自然他是极端关心那次法国政局的恶化的，他一再地要我把法国的消息详细地告诉他。但是那次事件不但没有改变、而且是加速了他访问朝鲜的计划。他告诉我们，比内政府逮捕杜克洛和其他的法国爱国者，很明显地是由于法国正直的人们掀起了抗议美国政府进行细菌战的愤怒浪潮。法国人民的这种正义举动使应对细菌战负责的美国政府极为狼狈，因此他们就命令比内政府用血腥的手段来镇压这种人道主义的举动。伊夫·法奇在那些美、法反动派气焰嚣张的日子里表现了他的大无畏的精神、浩然的正义气概和火焰一样的斗争热情。他说他要在尽可能短的时间内回到他的祖国去，揭露细菌战的真相。他说他已经完全准备好，为了真理，为了正义，为了和平，回到法国去坐牢。他认为正是为了这个，他就要收集到尽可能详细的关于美国进行细菌战的事实证据。他告诉我们，他在北京期间已经收集到足以证明细菌战确实在进行的事实证据，但是他还要收集更多的、更详细的、更直接的证据。
    六月一日，我们从北京出发了。我们只在东北作了短时间的逗留，就动身到朝鲜去。在朝鲜来往的路上，我们时常要受到美国飞机的骚扰，投照明弹，扫射，轰炸。不止一次，炸弹落在离我们很近的地方。但是伊夫·法奇对于这些一点也不在乎，他说：“我不在乎空袭，因为我经历过这些，并且我打过仗。”在来往的路上，我们的车子往往开得很快，常常颠簸得很厉害，有一次还遇到了倾盆大雨，我们的衣服都给从车篷上漏下来的雨水沾湿了。但是这时，伊夫·法奇一点也不把他的眉头皱起来，而是以他的为法国南方人所特有的豪爽的性格，讲了很多有趣的、令人发笑的事情。因为有伊夫·法奇的参加，我们的旅行是极其愉快的。
    伊夫·法奇追求真理的严肃、热烈的精神，是令人永远不忘的。他总是到了一个地方，就立刻开始工作，他不愿意让任何一个小时空闲地度过去。他在平壤，和凡是足以证明美国已在进行细菌战的各种各样的证人进行了极为详细的谈话，其中包括朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的保健相、保健副相，中国和朝鲜的科学专家，志愿军的战士，朝鲜的受害老百姓的家属，直到美国空投的朝鲜籍和中国籍的特务。他详细地勘察了各种证物和科学实验的结果，并且直接到曾经遭到美国细菌空袭的现场去作了实地调查。他对各种证人提出了各种各样的凡是可能否定这些事实的存在的问题，藉以辨明是非和真伪。对于每一次谈话和每一次实地调查，他都亲自作了详细的记录。每天回到住所之后，他都要认真地整理他的笔记。以后，在北朝鲜某地俘虏营，他和美国战俘奎恩、伊纳克和勃浪谈话的情形，以及在东北工作的情形，也都是这样。他最早发表的关于这次实地调查和访问的两篇文章，就是在路上写成的，其中一篇还是在从沈阳到北京的火车上写成的。从这里，就可以看到伊夫·法奇工作精神的严肃和勤劳了。
    伊夫·法奇是中国人民的亲爱的朋友。他以巨大的声音抗议了美国政府对朝中两国人民所进行的灭绝人道的细菌战。他宣布：“细菌战是对文明的挑战。”他的正义的抗议在全世界，特别是在欧洲获得了巨大的回响。伊夫·法奇对我国人民以及对世界和平和正义事业的这个勇敢行动，是我国人民永远不忘的。
    伊夫·法奇在他近年的著作中，一再地表达了法国进步知识界和劳动人民对于中国人民的热烈友谊。毫无疑问，这种友谊是会日益发扬光大起来的。我国人民也以同样的热烈友情，给予具有巴黎公社的革命传统的光荣的法国人民。我国人民对法国兄弟人民的这种亲爱友谊，已在去年五六月间全国各大城市成百万人民抗议法国反动政府逮捕杜克洛同志的集会和示威中，大规模地体现了出来。这是为伊夫·法奇先生所亲自目睹并使他无限感动的。伊夫·法奇先生告诉我：他希望将来再到中国来，他相信，那时中国将会变得更加美丽和更加幸福。他又告诉我：他深信，法国人民将会学习中国人民的榜样，而争得自己的独立和解放。他于去年五月二日在北京写的“法国人民为和平而战斗”（载一九五二年五月十日本报第四版）的一篇论文里热情洋溢地写道：“法国和平斗争的新局面连系到它伟大的革命传统，这种传统曾经使我们掌握着适当的时机准备王室的倾覆。人民和中产阶级在编写‘诉苦书’的时候，实际上就是在从事法国大革命的准备。“有时，人们对我们这样说：‘让法兰西保持着它的原状罢，因为这个“古老的国家”终归是一个美丽的国家啊。’我的答复是：没有什么古老的国家，当人民的力量获得解放的时候，一切国家都将重新变得很年轻。“说到这里，我要谈谈我在北京亲眼所看见的那使我衷心永远不忘的一个最大的纪念——一九五二年的‘五一’节。你们不仅把土地给了农民，把公道给了工人阶级，使你们的国家获得了独立；你们还给了青年们以扭秧歌的权利和热情。“秧歌就等于我们法国的四班舞，那也是手牵着手穿来穿去地跳着。在我们大都市的各区和村庄里，也有许多美丽的广场在等待着我们爱好幸福的人民到那里去载歌载舞。我们共和国的祖先为了下一代，在这些广场上种了些榆树和菩提树，他们把这些树叫作‘自由之树’。”伊夫·法奇的美好的希望定将变为伟大的现实。法国人民定会把他一生所致力的保卫法国的独立自由和保卫和平的正义事业继承起来。全世界爱好和平的人们定会永远记着这位忠诚的和平战士的光辉的形象，而加强自己的正义斗争。
