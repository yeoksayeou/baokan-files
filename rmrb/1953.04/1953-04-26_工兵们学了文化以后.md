After the Sappers Learned Culture

Qian Xuewen

In the spring of 1952, a brand-new train sped along the Jianyang section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The train was full of passengers and goods. In the third carriage, there were soldiers from the Fourth Engineer Regiment: Li Rongxiu, Li Fujian, Zheng Daqing, and Xu Guangxiang. They had just finished the last load of earth and drilled the last blasting hole in the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway construction project. Covered in dust, they rushed to the military region to participate in the highway construction work. Looking at the rolling hills, the green sugarcane fields, and the beautiful tangerine groves outside the window, they thought of the railway that the people of Sichuan had longed for for forty years, and now a section of it was open to traffic. Moreover, they had also shed the sweat of their labor on this section of the roadbed, and they felt very happy. However, they also thought: although we completed eight months of construction work four months ahead of schedule, if we knew how to use bulldozers, one machine could do the work of two hundred people, wouldn't that be faster? But without culture, it is impossible to master this modern machinery. This made them extremely anxious.

After the highway construction project began, Li Fujian encountered many difficulties in his work because he was illiterate. Take mechanical maintenance as an example. The oil gauge and diesel gauge have certain standard lines. If you make a mistake, it is easy to cause danger. There are thirty-six kinds of maintenance parts, and the oil lubrication maintenance time varies from eight hours to one thousand and twenty-four hours. He was illiterate and relied solely on his memory, so he was always incomplete. Although he also tried to find ways to draw a "○" for circular parts and a "——" for long parts to help him remember, he still made mistakes sometimes. This made him very sad. Therefore, the demand for learning culture became even more urgent.

After half a year of cultural studies, when I met Li Fujian again, he was already skillfully driving a No. 7 bulldozer at work.

Technician Xu Shaoqing told me: In relatively complex calculations for independent operations, such as how much earthwork requires how much labor, how much oil is needed, and the efficiency of the machine on highlands and plains, must be calculated accurately. Li Fujian can do these things after learning arithmetic. Currently, Li Fujian is learning business knowledge such as machine circuits, repair, and structure.

If someone tells you that now the comrades of the engineer regiment can learn maintenance in three days and learn to operate a bulldozer independently in a week, you will definitely not believe it. However, our people's soldiers have indeed created these miracles after mastering cultural knowledge.

Li Rongxiu, who was deeply anxious in the spring because of a lack of cultural knowledge, was able to take notes on the bulldozer maintenance course by October. He wrote in one of his notes: "Add lubricating oil to the rubber plate, pulley, and crankcase every eight hours, and add lubricating oil to the rotating part and control part every twenty-four hours. Change the water when the water tank temperature is high. All oil needs to be added at 1024 hours." In the engineer regiment, it is no longer a small number of people who can take such notes.

Moreover, with the improvement of cultural level, the comrades' spirit of inquiry has also been greatly improved. When learning about the carburetor structure, repair, and performance, the instructor considered that the study time was short and the students could not accept it, so he only required them to understand general knowledge. Technician Yang Guangzong said: "It takes at least seven or eight hours to learn, and even then, you may not be able to understand it thoroughly, it is too complicated." However, on the contrary, most comrades were not satisfied and demanded that it be explained more thoroughly. Zheng Daqing was like this. After class, he also experimented and researched according to the notes he took in class until he could skillfully operate what he learned in class.

In the teaching company headquarters, there is a terrain map hanging. This was surveyed and drawn by Xu Guangxiang, a soldier of the third-grade student and several comrades in his group. When I saw him this time, he was revising a newly drawn map. While looking at the map, I exclaimed, "It's drawn so well!" But he said that it was still far from perfect and that he needed to continue to study culture and professional knowledge. He emphasized that his current work achievements are inseparable from cultural studies. For example, when learning the names of landforms and features, as well as the symbols of villages and roads, because he learned culture, he could remember them and understand the meaning of those names and symbols, and the difficulties were much less. While speaking, he opened his notebook and explained the mapping process to me, talking eloquently. Finally, he said to me: "After we learned arithmetic, we rarely felt any difficulty in calculation. Think about it, without learning culture, without learning arithmetic, not to mention calculation, you wouldn't even be able to understand what you hear!"

In these days down to the company, I am excited every day by the new atmosphere that continues to emerge after our lovely soldiers learn culture. I once saw the artillerymen correctly aiming at hypothetical targets on the artillery positions; I listened to the signal soldiers excitedly explaining to me the knowledge of building bridges across the river. Now, when I see the soldiers of the engineer regiment operating bulldozers independently and working skillfully, a magnificent picture immediately appears in front of me, that is, the industrialization of the country, coupled with a strong national defense army, rapidly moving towards the future of socialism and communism.

    工兵们学了文化以后
    钱学文
    一九五二年春天，成渝铁路简阳段上飞奔着一趟崭新的列车。车上满载着客人和货物。在第三节车厢里，有四个工兵团的战士：李荣秀、李孚俭、郑达庆和徐光祥。他们刚刚在成渝路建筑工程中挑完最后一担土，打好最后一个炮眼，又带着满面风尘，赶来军区参加开辟公路的工作。他们望着窗外起伏的丘陵、碧绿的甘蔗林和美丽的橘柑地，想到这条四川人民渴望了四十年的铁路，如今已有一段通车了，而且在这段路基上，他们也洒下了劳动的汗珠，心里感到非常愉快。可是，他们又想：虽然我们四个多月就提前完成了八个月的建筑工程，但是如果我们会使用推土机，一部机器就能顶二百多人干活，那不更快了吗？可是没有文化，是掌握不了这个现代化机械的。这使他们异常着急。
    修筑公路工程开始后，李孚俭因为不识字，在工作中碰到不少困难。就拿机械保养一项来说，机油表，柴油表都有一定的标准线，弄错一点，都容易发生危险。保养的机件有三十六种，油类润滑保养时间，从八小时至一千零二十四小时，长短不同。他不识字，光凭脑袋记，总是记不周全。虽然他也想些办法，将圆形的机件画个“○”，将长形的机件画个“——”来帮助记忆，但是有时还要出错。这使他非常难过。于是，学习文化的要求就更加迫切了。
    经过半年的文化学习，当我又碰到李孚俭的时候，他已熟练地驾驶着七号推土机在工作了。
    技工徐少清告诉我：单独作业中比较复杂的计算工程，例如开多少土方要用多少人工、要用多少机油，还有机器在高地上和在平原上的效率，都要计算准确。这些，李孚俭在学了算术后，都能做到了。目前，李孚俭正在学习机器的电路、修理和构造等业务知识。
    假如有人告诉你：现在工兵团的同志们，三天能学会保养，一星期能学会单独操作推土机，你一定不相信。但是，我们的人民战士，在掌握了文化知识以后，就确确实实创造了这些奇迹。
    在春天还因没有文化知识而深感焦急的李荣秀，到十月里，已能作学习推土机保养课程的笔记了。他有一段笔记这样写着：“胶板、滑车和曲轴箱每八小时加润滑油一次，转动部和操纵部每二十四小时加润滑油一次。水箱温度高了就要换水。到一○二四小时就需全部加油。”在工兵团里，能作这样笔记的，已经不是少数人了。
    不仅如此，随着文化水平的提高，同志们的钻研精神也更加提高了。学到化油器构造、修理和性能的时候，教员考虑学习时间短，学员接受不了，只要求他们了解一般常识就够了。技工杨光宗说：“最少要学七、八小时，就这样或许还不能彻底搞懂，实在太复杂了。”但是，恰恰相反，大部分同志都不满足，都要求讲得彻底些，郑达庆就是如此。下了课后，他还按照笔记上记的实验着，研究着，直到把在课堂所学的能熟练地操作为止。
    在教导连连部里，挂着一幅地形图。这是三学级学员、战士徐光祥和他小组里的几位同志共同测绘的。这次我看到他的时候，他正在修改刚画好的一幅地图。我一边看着地图一边赞叹着：“画得太好了！”但是他却说现在还差得很远，还需要继续努力学习文化和业务知识。他强调地说他现在的工作成绩都和文化学习分不开。例如，学地貌、地物的名称，以及村庄和公路等符号的时候，因为学了文化，都能记下来，而且都能理解那些名称和符号的意思，困难是少得很了。他一边说着一边翻开笔记，向我解释地图的测绘过程，谈得头头是道。最后，他对我说：“我们在学习了算术以后，在计算上都很少感到困难了。你想，不学文化，不会算术，不说计算，就是听也听不懂啊！”
    在下连队的这些日子里，我天天为着我们可爱的战士学习文化后不断涌现的新气象激动着。我曾经在炮兵阵地上，看到了炮手们正确地瞄准假设目标的情景；我倾听了通信兵兴致勃勃地给我讲解隔河架桥的知识。现在当我又看到工兵团战士单独操纵推土机，在熟练地工作的时候，我眼前立刻出现一幅壮丽的图画，那就是国家工业化，加上强大的国防军，迅速地走向社会主义和共产主义的远景。
