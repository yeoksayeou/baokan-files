Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 22nd. China's first and largest highly automated and mechanized seamless steel tube plant is accelerating its construction, with all building work nearing completion. Now, the factory buildings have been erected in the center of the site, and the main production equipment inside the factory has also been installed. Mechanical installation technicians and workers are carefully adjusting and cleaning around the many complex machines with tools and instruments. The sound of machines test-running can be heard from every corner of the site from time to time. Electrical installation workers have laid most of the cable pipes and are now busy connecting tens of thousands of meters of cables and wires, and adjusting the circuits on the distribution panels. The pillars of the factory building have been painted sky blue, and the factory is particularly bright when the sunlight shines in obliquely. Workers covering the roof of the factory building are covering the corrugated roof with more than an inch thick purple-red and white lightweight glass and silvery-white asbestos tiles. The temporary railway tracks used for construction have been removed, and the railway tracks and asphalt roads needed for production are being laid. More than a hundred young female workers and dozens of male workers who are preparing to work in this factory have been divided into several study groups with the help of Soviet experts and technicians, and are learning how to operate the smooth machines they will be using during test runs.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 22nd. The construction of the modern thin plate rolling mill of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company has fully commenced. Currently, more than 3,000 workers and technicians have been put into this construction project. Various skilled workers are operating machinery and working intensively. Oxygen welders with safety belts tied around their arms are dismantling some of the old building frames; blasting workers are cleverly demolishing the foundations of old equipment; crane bridges resembling large iron bridges are lifting huge iron buckets, busily loading and unloading earth dug from the construction site; universal loaders are transporting concrete from the mixing plant to the site; and new Soviet-style concrete pumps that were not used last year are being installed with the help of Soviet experts. This concrete pump can pour thirty cubic meters of concrete per hour. It can pour concrete into any equipment foundation in the center of the site through thick pipes several hundred meters long from the concrete receiving platform on the edge of the site. At present, the foundations for more than seventy of the factory building's frame pillars have been poured. This project, together with the grand project of China's largest large-scale rolling mill, which is being built next to it, reflects a magnificent picture of the rapid development of China's heavy industry.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂接近完工
    薄板轧钢厂建设工程全面开工
    【新华社鞍山二十二日电】我国第一座最大的高度自动化机械化的无缝钢管厂正在加速建设，全部建筑工程已接近完工。现在，工厂厂房已经竖立在工地的中央，厂房内的主要生产设备也都安装起来。机械安装的技术人员和工人们，正在许多复杂的机器旁边，拿着工具、仪器，仔细地进行着调整和清洗的工作。工地的各个角落，不时地响起机器试运转的声音。电气安装工人们，已把大部分电缆管道铺设起来，现在正忙碌地在穿接上万公尺的电缆电线，和调整配电盘上的线路。厂房的柱架上，已经涂刷上天蓝色的油漆，当阳光斜射进来时，厂房内显得格外豁亮。搭盖厂房房顶的工人们，正将一寸多厚的紫红色、白色的轻量玻璃和银白色的石绵瓦，铺盖在波浪形的厂顶上。施工用的临时铁轨已被拆除，进行生产时所需要的铁轨和柏油路正在铺设。准备在这个厂工作的一百多个年轻的女工和数十个男工，在苏联专家和技术人员的帮助下已分成数个学习小组，正围着自己将要使用的光滑的机器，在试运转中学习操作。
    【新华社鞍山二十二日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司现代化的薄板轧钢厂建设工程已全面开工。现在，已有三千多工人和技术人员投入这一工程建筑。各种技术工人在操纵着机械紧张地工作，肩臂上系着安全带的氧焊工人，在拆除部分旧房架；爆破工人巧妙地炸毁旧的设备基础；大铁桥似的吊车，在提着巨大铁斗，忙碌地装卸从工地挖出的泥土；万能装卸机把混凝土从搅拌厂运到工地；去年没有用过的苏联新式混凝土泵，正由苏联专家帮助安装。这个混凝土泵每小时能够浇注三十立方公尺的混凝土，它可以在工地边上的混凝土受料台处，通过几百公尺长的粗大管子，浇灌工地中央的任何一个设备基础。目前厂房的房架柱子，已有七十多个基础浇灌完毕。这个工程和正在它旁边加紧兴建的我国最大的大型轧钢厂的宏伟工程相映，显示出一幅我国重工业建设正在飞速进行的壮丽图景。
