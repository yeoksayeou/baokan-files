    Reply from the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government Regarding the Issue of New Brick Specifications
    The Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government writes: The People's Daily published a letter on March 2nd from reader Zou Zhiyi suggesting the prompt announcement and implementation of new brick specifications. New brick specification standards involve design, construction, material supply, production, and other aspects, and is a national issue. To be cautious, the Ministry has decided to first extensively collect materials to reach a sound conclusion. We have now compared the new brick specifications with Soviet brick specifications and sent a letter to the Beijing Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, the Beijing Industrial Construction Materials Company, and the Ministry's Design Institute, Production Technology Bureau, and Materials Supply Bureau for specific consideration. A meeting will be held within one or two weeks for research. At the same time, the construction engineering bureaus of major administrative regions have been notified to telegraph the Ministry within a week regarding the trial implementation of new bricks over the past six months, existing problems, and their opinions. The team leaders of the Ministry's investigation teams to major administrative regions have also been instructed to conduct on-site inspections of this issue during the investigation process and submit comprehensive reports to the Ministry. After a conclusion is reached, we will immediately inform you.

    中央人民政府建筑工程部关于新砖规格问题的答复
    中央人民政府建筑工程部来信：三月二日人民日报发表了读者邹至毅建议迅速公布推行新砖规格的来信。新砖规格标准牵涉到设计、施工、材料供应、生产等多方面，是一个带有全国性的问题。为慎重起见，本部决定先广泛地搜集材料，以便取得完善结论。现在我们已将新砖规格及苏联砖规格作一比较，函发北京市财经委员会、北京市工业建筑器材公司和本部设计院、生产技术局、材料供应局作具体考虑，将于一、二周内召开会议加以研究。同时已通知各大行政区建筑工程局将半年来有关新砖试行情况、存在问题及他们的意见在一周内电告本部；并责成本部赴各大行政区调查工作队队长在调查过程中对这个问题进行实地考察，综合汇报本部。待作出结论后，当即告诉你们。
