Hubei Province Publicizes Policies to Correct Infringements on Middle Peasants; Farmers' Ideological Concerns Initially Alleviated, Production Enthusiasm Begins to Increase

In the spring plowing production campaign, various regions in Hubei discovered that people from all social strata had different ideological concerns. Some areas vigorously publicized the "Ten Measures Regarding Carrying Out the Agricultural Patriotic Increase Production Movement" from the Central-South Administrative Committee. The farmers' concerns were initially alleviated, and their enthusiasm for production began to increase. The spring plowing production movement is now unfolding. In areas where policies have not been vigorously publicized, the masses still have many concerns, the production movement is lackluster, and cannot be launched.

Many areas publicized the policy of protecting the private property rights of all strata and their labor income, which had good results. Liang Zhongchu, militia captain of Wuhong Township, Puqi County, said: "It is our cadres who are anxious to get to 'society' (socialism) quickly. The more anxious we are, the worse it gets. The mutual aid teams collapsed, and production was not vigorous. Now that I have studied the policy, I know that it is wrong to be impatient." The implementation of the policy shattered rumors. For example, the masses in Xia Kuo Township, Tongcheng County, said: "Now the government has announced that the land reform is over. We no longer believe the rumors spread by those bad people, saying that landlords will be reformed once, rich peasants twice, and middle peasants three times. These are bad people deceiving us." Wang Renzhong, a wealthy middle peasant in Shimiao Township, Xiaogan County, had never dug ditches or hoed weeds in his wheat fields since liberation. After hearing the policy, he also dug ditches and cleaned up the weeds. Yuan Qiuxian said at the People's Representative Conference in Shishou County: "In the past, I heard bad elements say that the Communist Party would collectivize farm tools and cattle and redistribute them. So, last year, I sold the good farm tools that others saw and hid those that others did not see. I will never add new ones; I will not participate in mutual aid teams either. Now I know that my past thoughts were wrong. The People's Government protects labor income and protects private property rights." After Jianyangyi Township in Jingmen County and Minyun Township in Anlu County publicized the policy of free lending, many people voluntarily lent money and grain to help each other. The masses in various places greatly supported the ten measures of the Central-South Administrative Committee. As Zhang Huaqing, a member of Yuanquan Township, Jingshan County, said: "The ten measures are really good, they can really be called the 'Bold Production Method'."

In the past, many places had phenomena of infringing on the interests of middle peasants. For example, when the cadres of the eighth district of Tongshan County, Pai Lou Township, were discussing how to solve the production difficulties of poor and hired peasants, group leader Chen Ronggang said: "I have a good idea, let's set up mutual aid teams immediately, and add a good middle peasant to each group, then the difficulties of the poor peasants will be solved." Some people borrowed things from middle peasants and did not return them, or made middle peasants suffer when "doing official business." These things greatly affected the production mood of middle peasants. After the cadres publicized the policy and criticized the thinking of infringing on the middle peasants, the middle peasant Chen Yuxian said: "What everyone said today is what I have been thinking. In the past, cadres had meetings and middle peasants provided quilts, so they could only cover themselves with cotton-padded jackets at night; when the masses had meetings at night, the middle peasants provided oil. So, I was afraid that others would be jealous if my production was good. Now I understand the policy, and I guarantee that I will actively produce in the future." He quickly formulated a plan for increased production.

In the past, many places carried out incorrect propaganda about socialism, which confused the thinking of some cadres and the masses. For example, Liang Zhongxiao of Wuhong Township, Puqi County, said: "Our mutual aid team was budding the year before last, flowering last year, fruiting this year, and merging next year." Wei Guangfu mutual aid team requested that fields, cattle, and farm tools be used collectively, and said: "It's so good to put them together and not have to worry about it yourself!" In Jiefang Township, District Three, Honghu County, someone publicized the direction of rural development like this: "We must help each other, with the haves helping the have-nots, and the many helping the few, so as to move towards socialism." As a result, many farmers had no intention of developing production. Zhu Yansheng, a poor peasant in Qianjin Township, Jiayu County, harvested fifty dan of grain last year, bought meat and fish every day, often went to the streets, went to tea houses, went to bars, bought whole packs of "Red Gold" cigarettes and put them at home to smoke, made new clothes for the whole family, spent all fifty dan of grain, and sat waiting for "socialism". Therefore, various places must continue to publicize the policy of protecting private property rights, clarify these confused thoughts, and correct the incorrect understanding of the future of socialism.

### 湖北各地宣传政策纠正侵犯中农现象  农民思想顾虑初步解除，生产积极性开始提高

    湖北各地宣传政策纠正侵犯中农现象
    农民思想顾虑初步解除，生产积极性开始提高
    湖北各地在春耕生产运动中，发现各阶层群众存在着各种不同的思想顾虑。有些地区大力宣传了中南行政委员会“关于开展农业爱国增产运动的十项措施”，农民的顾虑初步解除，生产积极性开始提高，春耕生产运动正在展开。凡是没有大力宣传政策的地方，群众顾虑仍然很多，生产运动冷冷清清，开展不起来。
    许多地区宣传了保护各阶层财产私有权利及其劳动所得的政策，收到了良好的效果。蒲圻县五洪乡的民兵队长梁忠楚说：“想快些到‘社会’（主义），就是我们干部在着急。越急越坏，互助组垮了，生产也不起劲了。现在学了政策，才知道急性图快是错的。”政策的贯彻击破了谣言。如通城县下阔乡的群众说：“现在政府宣布土地改革结束了，再不信那些坏人造谣了，说什么一次改地主，二次改富农，三次改中农，这是坏人骗我们的。”孝感县石庙乡富裕中农王仁中，解放后从没在麦田起过沟、锄过草，听了政策后也把沟挖起来，把草锄净了。袁秋先在石首县各界人民代表会上说：“过去我听坏分子说，共产党要把农具、耕牛都归公，重新分配，所以去年我把别人看见了的好农具都卖了，别人没看见的就藏起来，再也不添置新的了；互助组我也不参加。现在我才知道过去的想法错了，人民政府是保护劳动所得、保护私有权的。”荆门县建阳驿、安陆县民运乡在宣传了借贷自由的政策后，好多群众都自愿借出钱和粮食，互相帮助。各地群众对中南行政委员会的十项措施都非常拥护。正如京山县源泉乡委员张华清所说：“十项措施真好，真可以叫做‘大胆生产法’。”
    过去，好多地方有侵犯中农利益的现象。如通山县八区排楼乡在开干部会讨论如何解决贫雇农的生产困难时，小组长陈荣刚说：“我想了个好办法，把互助组马上成立起来，每组参加一个好中农，贫农的困难就解决了。”有些人借中农的东西不还，或在“出公事”时使中农吃亏。这些事情大大影响了中农的生产情绪。在干部宣传了政策和批判了侵犯中农的思想后，中农陈玉仙说：“今天大家说的都是我心里的话。以前干部开会中农出被子，自己夜晚只能盖棉袄；群众夜晚开会中农出油。所以我就怕生产好了人家眼红。现在我懂得了政策，我保险今后积极生产。”他很快地订出了增产的计划。
    有好多地方过去对社会主义进行了不正确的宣传，使一部分干部和群众思想混乱了。如蒲圻县五洪乡梁忠孝说：“我们互助组是前年打苞，去年开花，今年结果，明年合伙。”魏光富互助组要求把田地、耕牛、农具等集中使用，并且说：“合在一块又不要自己操心，多好呀！”洪湖县三区解放乡，有人这样宣传农村的发展方向：“我们要互相帮助，有的帮无的，多的帮少的，这样走到社会主义。”这样一来，许多农民就无心发展生产了。嘉鱼县前进乡贫农朱炎生，去年收五十石粮食，每天割肉买鱼，经常上街，茶馆进，酒馆出，买整条的“红金”香烟放在家里抽，全家做新衣服，把五十石粮食全部花光了，坐着等“社会主义”。因此，各地还须继续宣传保护私有财产权的政策，澄清这些混乱思想，纠正对社会主义前途的不正确的认识。
