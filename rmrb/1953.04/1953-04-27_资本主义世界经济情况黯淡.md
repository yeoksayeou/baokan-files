Xinhua News Agency, New York, 25th: The United Nations Economic and Social Council is holding a meeting in New York. During the discussion of the world economic situation, the speeches of representatives from many capitalist countries reflected a gloomy picture of the capitalist world economy.

    Representatives of Western European countries expressed concern in their speeches about the severe economic crisis in Western Europe. The expansion of armaments and the squeezing of the capitalist world market by the United States have led to the shrinking of industrial production and the decline of export trade in Western Europe. Many Western European representatives acknowledged that Western Europe has experienced economic recession.
    French representative Boris, when talking about the French economic situation, said that in the last few months of 1952, French industrial activity decreased, and economic recession began, leading to increased unemployment. He also pointed out that many Western European countries have encountered great difficulties in terms of balance of payments. The protectionist tariff policies of the United States are causing difficulties for European trade. He predicted that a serious economic recession will occur in the near future.
    Belgian representative Van Lai said that Belgium had already shown serious signs of the beginning of an economic recession in 1952, and these signs have become more serious in 1953.
    British representative Jeb, like other Western countries' representatives, expressed dissatisfaction with the measures taken by the United States to restrict the import of foreign goods. He said that if the United States does not find a way to abolish these restrictions on the import of foreign goods in its domestic and foreign policies, other countries cannot hope to improve their foreign trade situation.
    Regarding the economic situation in the United States, the French representative believed in his speech that a serious economic recession is about to occur in the United States. He said that even if this economic recession in the United States is smaller in scale than that of 1937-1938, it would be enough to cause "economic and social disruptions" in other capitalist countries.
    Representatives of many underdeveloped countries emphasized in their speeches that the economic situation in their countries has deteriorated in recent years. Representatives from Argentina and Uruguay said that because the prices of raw materials exported by their countries have fallen, while the prices of imported goods have risen, their countries' trade has become even more unbalanced. The Cuban representative pointed out that this trade imbalance has severely hit the economy of sugar-producing Cuba, and Cuba has experienced alarming unemployment.

    资本主义世界经济情况黯淡
    【新华社二十五日讯】纽约消息：联合国经社理事会正在纽约举行会议。在会议讨论世界经济情况的过程中，许多资本主义国家代表的发言反映出一幅资本主义世界经济情况黯淡的图画。
    西欧国家代表在发言中对西欧严重经济危机情况表示不安。由于扩张军备以及美国在资本主义世界市场排挤的结果，已使西欧工业生产萎缩，输出贸易衰退。许多西欧国家代表承认：西欧已出现经济萧条现象。
    法国代表波里斯在谈到法国经济情况时说，在一九五二年最后几个月中，法国工业活动减少了，经济萧条开始来临，使失业增加。他并且指出，西欧许多国家在支付平衡方面遇到了很大困难。美国的保护关税政策正在使欧洲贸易遭到困难。他预料在最近的将来，将要发生严重的经济萧条。
    比利时代表范莱说，比利时在一九五二年已出现了经济萧条的初期的严重迹象，在一九五三年这种迹象更加严重了。
    英国代表杰伯和其他西方国家的代表一样，对美国所实行的限制外国货入口的措施表示不满。他说，如果美国不设法在国内和国外政策上废除这种对外国货入口的限制，其他国家就无法希望改善对外贸易情况。
    关于美国的经济情况，法国代表在发言中认为，美国即将发生严重的经济萧条。他说，美国这种经济萧条即使比一九三七—一九三八年的规模较小，也足以引起其他资本主义世界各国的“经济和社会的紊乱”。
    许多落后国家代表在发言中强调指出，最近几年来，他们国家的经济情况更加恶化了。阿根廷和乌拉圭代表说，由于他们国家出口的原料价格下跌，而同时入口货物的价格上涨，他们的国家的贸易已更加不能平衡。古巴代表指出，这种贸易不平衡情况，使出产甘蔗的古巴的经济遭到严重的打击，古巴已产生惊人的失业现象。
