    Problems Revealed by Three Thousand Opinions
    Ji Yin
    The First Ministry of Machine Building's Basic Construction Bureau's East China Construction Engineering Company conducted a mass inspection of construction projects from 1952 in February. During the inspection, employees submitted nearly three thousand suggestions, collectively exposing the chaotic phenomena of lack of responsibility and irresponsibility in basic construction work.
    First, there was chaos in construction management. Almost all construction sites lacked clear and specific plans and designated personnel responsible for construction preparation and organization (including site layout, material and tool supply, labor allocation, the workload for each period, and a detailed schedule for the entire construction process). For example, the Shanghai Tool Factory did not submit daily project reports for more than a month, leaving leaders in the dark about project progress. The site director and construction workers did not know what had been done or what remained to be done. Another example is the Pujiang Machine Factory project, which was originally scheduled to be completed in two hundred and ten working days but ended up taking a full year due to mid-course changes to the plan.
    The chaotic situation of material procurement, storage, and supply being nobody's responsibility was even more serious. Of the 140 construction sites under the Engineering Department, only 26 had material accounts. The actual amount of materials was a complete mystery. Many materials were blindly purchased and did not meet specifications, forcing workers to use long materials for short purposes and large materials for small purposes. After the completion of the Tongji University project, over 50,000 jin of sawn scrap wood was discarded, all of which had to be burned as firewood. The untimely and non-conforming supply of materials also forced many projects to stop work awaiting materials or affected the quality of the projects: the construction site of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory was halted for more than a month because it was waiting for an electric pump; the dormitory project of the Shanghai No. 2 Wire Factory was stalled for a long time because there were no cast iron pipes for the toilets, and the cement work could not proceed. In addition, there was also a phenomenon of large amounts of materials being stockpiled for a long time due to a lack of planning in material preparation: the cement shipped to the Shanghai Chemical Plant in 1951 was not used up until August 1952; many steel bars rusted and scaled due to prolonged stockpiling; in particular, large batches of lime were piled together, which could easily generate heat and ignite, causing a fire. After equipment and materials arrived at the construction site, many construction sites did not have a sound receiving, dispatching, and storage system, and a large number of materials were wasted: after the timber for the Minhang Engineering Department was transported, it was piled up on the banks of the Huangpu River, exposed to the sun and rain, and wood worth more than 33 million yuan was lost. Many wood materials were scattered everywhere on the site, some were crushed by cars, some were dragged away by people to make planks, and some were even used as firewood. The unplanned stacking of materials also caused a lot of waste: at the construction site of the Shanghai Public Transport Company, tens of thousands of bricks of various specifications were piled together. When they were needed later, people had to be sent to re-sort the large pile of bricks one by one, which cost 124 man-days; at the Tongji University construction site, the materials for building student dormitories were piled up at the construction site of the faculty and staff dormitories. During construction, a carpenter needed nine odd-job men to move materials from east to west for him.
    The chaos in tool supply also caused a lot of waste. At the Tongji University construction site, no tools were prepared before digging the soil. As a result, the workers had to carry the soil by hand every day. According to statistics, more than 2,000 man-days were consumed as a result.
    Labor planning, organization, and allocation also showed a chaotic state of nobody being responsible in various workshops. Many construction site managers did not understand the workers' technical skills and allocated work inappropriately. For example, the carpenters at the Shanghai No. 2 Wire Factory construction site were either making seal boxes in the past or coffins in the past. Gathering these people together resulted in poor product quality and increased reject rates. Labor dispatch was also often carried out blindly and lacked a system. When the dormitory of the Shanghai No. 2 Wire Factory construction site was being plastered, only one ash-removing team was assigned to the twelve plastering teams. The ash-removing team was too busy, but the plastering workers were idle. The Public Transport Company construction site did not need bricklayers, but 39 were sent in a muddle, with nothing to do, they had to knock on the three-earth, wasting twenty-two days.
    According to incomplete statistics from four engineering departments, the direct losses caused by material waste and improper labor allocation amounted to more than 1.9 billion yuan.
    In terms of construction technology management, there is also a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible. Construction cadres in charge are busy all day with tasks such as receiving funds, filling out reports, and verifying material payments, and have little time to supervise and inspect on-site projects, so that technical regulations cannot be implemented and construction errors occur frequently. Although there is an inspection at the end of the project acceptance, the errors have become a fait accompli, and the country's losses are difficult to recover. Some construction site leaders only seek fast project progress and neglect to ensure project quality. For example, Wang Heting, the deputy director of the Shanghai Ship Repair Factory construction site, established a miscellaneous work system that stipulates that two rooms of cement should be rammed on the roof every day. Once the work is done, the workers are released from work, without stipulating the quality of the work. As a result, the workers worked hard to rush, and some finished ramming in half a day, resulting in very poor project quality and a loss of more than 1,000 man-days.
    The workers also revealed the chaotic state of no one being responsible for the promotion of advanced work methods, the development of rationalization proposals, and safety, health, and welfare. In the past, the workers at the construction sites of the East China Construction Engineering Company had spontaneously proposed many good methods for improving work and created many improved tools. However, there was no organization at the construction sites responsible for handling workers' rationalization proposals, nor was there a reward system. Workers with inventions and creations did not know who to tell. Safety and health on construction sites are generally neglected: there are no safety facilities for high-altitude operations, insufficient fire-fighting equipment, and no safety production inspection system, poor medical equipment, and poor food. Due to insufficient leadership inspection, corruption incidents by food management personnel were commonly found on construction sites, arousing great dissatisfaction among the workers. This chaotic situation has generally lowered the workers' production enthusiasm and relaxed labor discipline. The workers of the Shanghai No. 2 Wire Factory said during the inspection: "We only work for a maximum of five hours a day, and we waste three hours every day."
    The evil consequences of the above-mentioned chaotic situations of no one being responsible are generally poor project quality and slow project progress. Based on the problems identified above, the East China Construction Engineering Company is now formulating various responsibility systems to gradually improve its work.

    三千条意见所揭露的问题
    季音
    第一机械工业部基本建设局华东建筑工程公司，在二月间对一九五二年施工工程进行了一次群众性的大检查。在检查中职工们提出了将近三千条意见，集中地暴露了基本建设工作中无人负责和不负责任的混乱现象。
    首先是施工管理工作的混乱。差不多所有工地对施工的准备和组织工作（包括工地布置、材料工具供应、劳动力调配、每个时期的工作量以及整个施工程序的周密进度计划），都没有明确具体的计划和专人负责。如上海工具厂有一个多月不送工程日报表，领导上对工程进度心中无数，工地主任和施工员不知过去已经做了多少，还要做什么。又如浦江机器厂工程，原定二百一十个工作日完工，因为中途改变计划，结果整整拖了一年。
    材料采购、保管与供应无人负责的混乱状况更是严重。工程处一百四十个工地，只有二十六个工地有材料账，材料究竟有多少，是一篇糊涂账。有许多材料因为是盲目购进的，不合规格，只好长料短用、大料小用。同济大学工程结束后，这种锯断的废木料废弃达五万余斤，全部只好当柴烧。由于材料供应不及时和不合规格，还迫使许多工程停工待料或影响工程质量：国营上海第一棉纺织厂工地，就因为等一个电动帮浦，一直停工了一个多月；上海电线二厂宿舍工程仅仅因为厕所用的生铁管没有，水泥工程无法进行，整个宿舍工程长期停了下来。另外，也有因为材料准备工作无计划而造成大量材料长期积压的现象：上海化工厂一九五一年运来的水泥，到一九五二年八月还未用完；许多钢筋因堆积过久而生锈起壳；特别是大批石灰堆在一起，很易发热燃烧，酿成火灾。器材运抵工地后，许多工地都没有完善的收发保管制度，大量材料被糟塌：闵行工程处木料运来后就堆在黄浦江边，日晒雨淋，烂去了价值三千三百多万元的木料。许多木料在场地上到处乱丢，有的被汽车压断，有的被人拖去做铺板，甚至当柴烧。材料无计划的乱堆，也造成许多浪费：上海公共交通公司工地上，把数万块各种规格的砖头堆在一起，以后要用时，只好重新派人把一大堆砖头一块块的重新拣开，花了一百二十四个人工；同济大学工地上，造学生宿舍的材料被堆在教职员宿舍工地上，施工时，一个木工要有九个杂工专门来替他从东到西的搬材料。
    工具供应的混乱，也造成许多浪费，如同济大学工地上，在挖土前没有准备好工具，结果工人们每天只好用手搬土，据统计，因此消耗的人工达二千多个。
    劳动力计划、组织和调配，各工场上也都表现了无人负责的混乱状态。许多工地的管理人员对工人的技术情况不了解，分配工作不适当。如上海电线二厂工地的木工，有的是过去做图章盒子的，有的是过去做棺材的，把这些人集中在一起，结果就使产品质量低劣，废品率增加。劳动力调派也常常是盲目进行的，缺乏制度。上海电线二厂工地宿舍粉刷时，十二个刷粉小组，只配备了一个掏灰沙的小组，掏灰沙的忙不过来，粉刷的工人却闲着。公共交通公司工地上不需要泥工，却糊里糊涂地调来了三十九个，无事可做，只好去敲三合土，浪费了二十二天。
    据四个工程处的不完全统计，关于材料浪费、劳动力调配不当造成的直接损失，共达十九亿余元。
    在施工技术管理方面，也存在着严重的无人负责现象。施工负责干部整天忙于领款、填报表、核付材料等事务工作，很少时间督促和检查现场工程，以致技术规程不能贯彻，施工错误不断发生。在工程结束验收时，虽有一次检查，但错误已成既成事实，国家的损失已难挽回。更有些工地领导人只求工程进度快，忽视保证工程质量。如上海船舶修造厂工地副主管王鹤亭订了个杂工制度，规定每天捣屋面水泥二间，做完放工，而不规定工作质量，于是工人们拚命赶快，有的半天就捣好，结果工程质量极坏，损失了一千多个人工。
    工人们也揭发了关于推广先进工作法、开展合理化建议工作、关于安全卫生和生活福利等方面无人负责的混乱状态。华东建筑工程公司各工地上的工人们，过去曾自发的提出过许多改进工作的良好方法，创造了不少改良工具，但工地上却没有负责处理工人合理化建议工作的机构，也没有奖励制度，工人们有了创造发明，也不知向谁去说。工地安全卫生普遍地被忽视：高空作业没有安全设备，防火器具不足，也没有安全生产的检查制度，医药设备很差，伙食不好。由于领导上检查不够，工地上普遍发现伙食管理人员的贪污事件，引起工人们很大不满。这种混乱情况，使工人们生产情绪普遍低落，劳动纪律松懈，上海电线二厂工人在检查时自己说：“我们一天工作最多只有五小时，每天要浪费三小时。”
    以上种种无人负责的混乱状况所产生的恶果，就是普遍的工程质量低劣，工程进展迟缓。华东建筑工程公司根据以上检查出来的问题，现正制订各种责任制度，逐步改进工作。
