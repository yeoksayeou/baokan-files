Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Workers in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and other countries continue to carry out labor emulation drives to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day, and have already achieved considerable success.

　　The workers of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace workshop of the Kuznetsk Stalin Iron and Steel Plant in the Soviet Union fulfilled their guarantee of producing 3,000 tons of steel in excess of the plan during April for the "May Day" festival in early April. Steelworkers Nazarenko, Koplov, and others smelted 21 furnaces of steel using rapid methods in early April, increasing steel production per square meter of furnace bottom area by 2,480 kilograms. The workers of the Magnitogorsk factory, who launched a socialist emulation drive with the Kuznetsk workers, also achieved great success. On the 3rd, steelworker Polotsky completed his 527th furnace of steel, the fifth since July, one hour ahead of schedule, and the open-hearth furnace did not require repairs. During the competition, workers from both places also exchanged production experiences. The Magnitogorsk workers, following the example of the Kuznetsk workers, improved the charging work of the open-hearth furnace, reducing the steelmaking time by one and a half to two hours. The factory's average daily steel production increased by 5 percent compared to last year. Miners of the "Kurakhovka" mine in Donbass completed the May Day emulation drive covenant one month ahead of schedule. They increased the average daily mining volume to a level even higher than the mining volume of the last year of the Five-Year Plan. Advanced worker L. Ogorodnik used a new machine to drill through more than 13 meters of tunnel passage in one day and night, which would normally take ten days to complete. The Stakhanovite foundry workshop of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory has recently exceeded the plan by producing 8 to 10 tons of products more per day. Hundreds of lathe operators, fitters, milling machine operators, forgers, and foundry workers at the Kharkov Transport Machinery Manufacturing Plant completed half a year's worth of tasks during the competition days. Oil drilling rig operators in Borislav, Ukraine, have doubled the drilling speed. In Azerbaijan, the Izzyat work team of the Baku offshore oil field was the first to complete the six-month drilling plan.

　　Metallurgical workers at the Kladno United Steel Plant in Czechoslovakia are successfully fulfilling their socialist guarantees for celebrating the great festival of "May Day." Due to the study and adoption of the advanced experience of Soviet Magnitogorsk steelworkers, Kladno steelworkers Cermak, Fiman, and Volzak extended the service life of steelmaking furnaces by 35 days. They smelted 1,467 furnaces of steel without needing to repair the furnaces, and many furnaces were smelted at high speed. In the "May Day" competition among oil workers, the oil workers of Luže were awarded the championship title for achieving the highest results in the oil well drilling competition.

　　In Romania, many labor heroes with excellent work achievements have put forward new guarantees in the "May Day" labor emulation drive. Labor hero K. Stefan of the Demisoara Electric Motor Factory, after completing the task of the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), is already working on the 1956 task and has put forward new "May Day" guarantees. Miner K. Gcha, after completing the 1955 plan on April 16, put forward a new guarantee at the conference where he was elected as a labor hero, to complete one more month's quota before "May Day."

　　In Bulgaria, all the miners in the mining city of Dimitrovgrad launched a competition. They implemented the advanced Soviet method of rapid tunnel excavation and achieved great success. All the miners of the Jimi Ter Blagoev mine are at the forefront, and they completed 114 percent of the coal mining plan in the thirteen days of April. Foreman Vladimir Pavlov of the "97" mine completed 330 percent of the plan.

　　In Albania, with the imminent arrival of "May Day," workers' enthusiasm for labor is constantly increasing in various industrial enterprises. Enterprises in Tirana, such as the shoe factory, the Domis Mammu wood factory, the "December 21" construction factory, as well as the leather factory in Kolsa and the drilling enterprises in the Patos oil field, have all exceeded the first quarter's production plan by 105 to 110 percent. Now they are working hard to complete the April plan ahead of schedule. Workers at the Enver Hoxha factory have put forward a guarantee to greet the "May Day" festival by manufacturing parts for construction equipment ahead of schedule.

    苏捷罗等国工人继续进行“五一”劳动竞赛
    据新华社讯：苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚等国工人继续为迎接“五一”国际劳动节进行劳动竞赛，并已获得不少成就。
    苏联库兹涅茨克斯大林钢铁厂第二平炉间的工人，在四月上旬就实现了他们为“五一”节提出的在四月间超计划多生产三千吨钢的保证。炼钢工人纳扎连科、科普洛夫等在四月上旬用快速方法炼了二十一炉钢，并使每平方公尺炉底面积的产钢量增加二千四百八十公斤。和库兹涅茨克工人展开社会主义竞赛的马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂工人也获得了巨大成就。在三日那天，炼钢工人波洛茨基提前一小时炼完了七个月来第五百二十七炉钢，而平炉还不需要修理。在竞赛过程中两地工人还交流生产经验。马格尼托哥尔斯克工人效法库兹涅茨克工人的榜样改进平炉装料工作，把炼钢时间减少了一小时半到两小时。该厂每天平均产钢量比去年增加了百分之五。顿巴斯“库拉霍夫卡”矿工们提前一个月完成了五一竞赛的公约。他们把每昼夜平均开采量提高到比五年计划最后一年还要高的开采量。先进工人列·奥戈罗德尼克在一昼夜间用新机器打通了平常需要十天时间才能打通的十三公尺以上的坑道通洞。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的斯塔哈诺夫式翻砂间，最近每天超过计划多生产八吨到十吨产品。哈尔科夫运输机器制造厂的数百名车工、钳工、铣工、锻工和铸工，在竞赛的日子里完成了半年的任务。乌克兰共和国鲍利斯拉夫的石油钻探机操使者们使钻探速度增加了一倍。在阿塞拜疆，巴库海上油田的伊齐阿特工作队首先完成了六个月钻井计划。
    捷克斯洛伐克的克拉德诺联合炼钢厂的冶金工人正在顺利地完成他们为庆祝“五一”这一伟大节日所提出的社会主义保证。由于研究和采用了苏联马格尼托哥尔斯克炼钢工人的先进经验，克拉德诺的炼钢工人切尔马克、菲曼和伏尔扎克把炼钢炉的使用期限延长了三十五天。他们熔炼了一千四百六十七炉钢，而不需要修理炉子，并且有许多炉都是高速熔炼。在石油工人的“五一”竞赛中，卢热次的石油工人在钻探油井的竞赛中，由于获得最高成绩而得到冠军称号。
    罗马尼亚许多具有优越工作成绩的劳动英雄在“五一”劳动竞赛中纷纷提出新的保证。底密索拉电动机工厂的劳动英雄科·斯捷凡在完成五年计划（一九五一—一九五五）的任务后，已在做一九五六年的工作任务并提出了新的“五一”保证。矿工科·格查在四月十六日完成一九五五年计划后，在他被选为劳动英雄的大会上提出了新的保证，要在“五一”前再完成一个月的定额。
    在保加利亚，矿都季米特洛夫城全体矿工都展开了竞赛。他们实行苏联先进的坑道快速掘进法，获得了很大的成绩。吉米捷尔·布拉戈耶夫矿场的全体矿工走在最前面，他们在四月份的十三天中完成了百分之一百十四的采煤计划。“九七”矿场的坑道领班弗拉吉米尔·巴夫洛夫完成了计划的百分之三百三十。
    在阿尔巴尼亚各工业企业中，随着“五一”的即将来到，工人劳动热情不断提高。地拉那的企业，如制鞋工厂、多米斯·马姆木工工厂、“十二月二十一”建筑工厂，以及科尔萨的皮革工厂、帕托斯石油田的钻探企业等都超额完成了第一季度生产计划百分之一百零五到百分之一百一十。现在它们正在为提前完成四月份计划而努力。恩威尔·霍查工厂的工人已为迎接“五一”节提出保证，要提前制成建筑设备的零件。
