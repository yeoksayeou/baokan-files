Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The campaign struggles for Japanese Diet members have unfolded fiercely. As of the 1st, candidate registration for all parties has nearly been completed. The total number of candidates has reached 1,472.

    The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions recently formulated its policy on the general election. It put forward demands concerning the vital interests of the Japanese working class, such as opposing war, opposing rearmament, and opposing intensified labor, and called on workers across the country to elect Diet member candidates who support these demands. At the same time, it also requested the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) to adopt the same attitude in the general election. Sohyo has decided to recommend candidates who oppose rearmament and to mobilize union members and their families to support candidates who oppose rearmament.

    Targeting the strong anti-rearmament sentiment among Japanese voters, the Yoshida Liberal Party, taking advantage of the fact that the Reform Party, led by Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu, and the Hatoyama Liberal Party, which split from the Liberal Party, openly used rearmament as a campaign slogan, is still adopting the deceptive policy of so-called "gradually increasing defense capabilities" in this general election to deceive voters, even though the Yoshida government has consistently been active in rearmament in its actual actions. According to the March 28th issue of "The Economist" magazine, "The business community believes that Yoshida's rearmament method is very good and is giving it support."

    Japanese monopoly capital groups are actively plotting to manipulate the Japanese general election and support Japanese conservative parties in establishing a conservative government that serves the interests of monopoly capital. On March 23rd, the leaders of the four Japanese capitalist groups—the Federation of Economic Organizations, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, and the Keizai Doyukai—held a meeting to discuss the manipulation of the general election. The meeting believed that in order to deal with progressive forces, the Japanese business community should actively assist conservative forces in the general election and provide conservative parties with as much election funding as possible. At the same time, the heads of the Japanese conservative parties are also vying to humbly beg for assistance from the monopoly capital groups. Following Yoshida's separate invitations to major capitalists in various regions for talks, requesting their assistance, Mamoru Shigemitsu, the head of the Reform Party and a Class A war criminal, also hosted a banquet on the 27th for about 40 Japanese business leaders, including Aiichiro Fujiyama, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Ichiro Ishikawa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations. Shigemitsu asked them to give the Reform Party support in the general election. It is reported that Japanese business leaders told Shigemitsu that they hoped that the conservative parties could form a conservative coalition government after the general election to "stabilize the Japanese political situation," in exchange for their financial support to the conservative parties in the general election.

    Just as the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are attempting to continue to implement a policy of remilitarizing Japan through this Japanese general election, more notorious extreme militarists than in the last general election are emerging one after another, participating in the election of Diet members. Hideki Tojo's cabinet minister, Shinya Kasai, has recently announced his participation in the election for the House of Representatives. Kasai was formerly a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Another war criminal, Jiro Horikoshi, also announced his participation in the election for the House of Representatives. Horikoshi had served in the Taiwan Governor's Office. Ugaki Kazushige, a notorious Japanese war criminal, recently announced his participation in the House of Councillors election. Ugaki was a giant in the former fascist military establishment in Japan, having served as Minister of the Army, Governor-General of Korea, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and actively planned the Japanese imperialist war of aggression. After the war, under the protection of the United States, Ugaki was able to escape justice and was removed from the purge list by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries last year. Other militarists and war criminals participating in the House of Councillors election include: Toshikazu Tsushima, who served as president of the "North China Development Company," which plundered resources in North China during the war, Minister of Finance in the Koiso Cabinet, and Minister of Finance in the Higashikuni Cabinet at the end of the war; Tatsuo Munoo, who served as the Director-General of the General Affairs Agency of the puppet Manchukuo State, the first mayor of Singapore after Japan occupied Singapore during the Pacific War, and Minister of Home Affairs in the Koiso Cabinet; Fumio Goto, who served as the vice president of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association" and a core member of the wartime police bureaucracy; Hisatada Hirose, the Minister of Health and Welfare in the Koiso Cabinet and the head of the "Industrial Patriotic Society"; Sakuya Ino, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Tojo Cabinet; Kazuo Aoki, a war criminal who served as Minister of Finance, Minister of State, and Minister of Greater East Asia during the war; Masaru Katsuji, a former Japanese Navy Vice Admiral who secretly actively revived fascist forces and was the mastermind behind the assassination plot against Japanese Communist Party leader Kyuichi Tokuda in 1948; Takuji Mikami and other notorious fascist figures who had close ties with the assassination group are also openly running for election.

    The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" admits that there is no freedom of election at all in Japanese rural areas. The "Asahi Shimbun" editorial on March 27th said: Some incidents in last year's general election "prove that in rural areas where the power of landlords is still strong, voters do not even have the freedom to vote. Rural youths know the illegal acts of landlords and local bullies in every election. However, it is very difficult to expose such illegal acts or oppose candidates nominated by local bullies. This is because their lives are in the hands of landlords and local bullies. If they oppose the landlords and local bullies, they cannot even guarantee their own lives. One reason why rural areas have become a solid stronghold for conservative parties is this."

    日本国会议员的竞选斗争正剧烈展开
    日本工会组织支持反对重整军备的候选人
    垄断资本集团加紧策划操纵大选建立反动政府
    据新华社讯：日本国会议员的竞选斗争已在剧烈展开。到一日为止，各党派候选人登记已接近完毕。候选人数已共达一千四百七十二名。
    全日本产业别工会会议最近拟订了它对大选的政策。它提出了反对战争、反对重整军备和反对加强劳动强度等有关日本工人阶级切身利害的要求，并号召全国工人选举赞成这些要求的国会议员候选人。同时，它并要求日本工会总评议会在大选中也采取同样态度。日本工会总评议会已决定要推荐反对重整军备的候选人，并动员工会会员和他们的家属来支持反对重整军备的候选人。
    针对着日本选民强烈地反对重整军备的情绪，吉田自由党趁着以甲级战犯重光葵为首的改进党和从自由党分裂出去的鸠山自由党公开以重整军备为竞选口号的机会，仍然在这次大选中采取所谓“逐渐增加防卫力”的欺骗政策来骗取选票，虽然吉田政府在实际行动中对重整军备一贯积极。据三月二十八日的“经济学人”杂志透露，“实业界认为吉田的重整军备办法很好，正在给予支持。”
    日本垄断资本集团正在积极策划操纵日本大选，支持日本保守党派建立为垄断资本利益服务的保守政府。三月二十三日，经济团体联合会、日本商工会议所、日本经营者团体联盟、经济同友会这四个日本资本家团体的领袖们举行会议，商讨操纵大选问题。会议认为，为了对付进步力量，日本企业界在大选中应积极援助保守势力，要尽可能地给保守政党以大选资金。同时，日本各保守党派的首脑也争前恐后奴颜卑膝地向垄断资本集团乞援。继吉田分别邀请各地大资本家举行会谈、要求给他以协助之后，改进党的首脑、甲级战犯重光葵也在二十七日宴请约四十名日本商界首脑，包括日本商工会议所主席滕山爱一郎和经济团体联合会会长石川一郎等人。重光要求他们在大选中给改进党以支持。据悉，日本商界首脑向重光葵表示，他们希望保守党派在大选以后能组成一个保守的联合政府，以“稳定日本政局”，交换条件是他们在大选中给保守党派以财政支持。
    正当美、日反动派企图通过日本这次大选继续推行使日本重新军国主义化的政策的时候，比上次大选时更多的臭名远扬的极端军国主义分子正在纷纷出头露面，参加国会议员竞选。罪行昭彰的日本战犯宇垣一成最近宣布参加参议员竞选。宇垣是日本前法西斯军部的巨头，历任陆相、朝鲜总督、外务相等职，曾积极策划日本帝国主义的侵略战争。战后在美国的庇护下，宇垣得以逍遥法外，并在去年被美、日反动派解除整肃。其他参加参议员竞选的军国主义分子和战犯有：战时曾任大肆掠夺华北资源的“北支那开发会社”总裁、小矶内阁藏相、战争结束时东久迩内阁藏相的津岛寿一；曾任伪满国务院总务厅长、太平洋战争期间日本侵占新加坡后任首届新加坡市长、小矶内阁内务相的大达茂雄；曾任“大政翼赞会”副总裁、战时警察官僚的核心分子后藤文夫；小矶内阁厚生相、“产业报国会”的头领广濑久忠；东条内阁农林相井野硕哉；战时历任藏相、国务相、大东亚相的战犯青木一男；前日本海军中将、战后暗中积极活动复活法西斯势力的首脑人物、一九四八年阴谋暗杀日本共产党领袖德田球一的暗杀团的幕后指使者真崎胜次；与暗杀团有密切联系的三上卓等臭名远扬的法西斯分子也公开出来竞选。
    日本资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”承认，在日本农村根本没有选举自由。“朝日新闻”三月二十七日的社论说：去年大选的一些事件“证明在地主势力依然强大的农村，选民甚至连投票的自由也没有。农村的青年们在每次选举时，都知道地主和土豪劣绅的非法行为。但是，揭发这种非法行为，或反对由土豪所推举的候选人是很困难的。这是因为他们的生活本身就掌握在地主和土豪手里，要是反对地主和土豪，就连自己的生活也保证不了。现在，农村成为保守政党的坚固地盘的一个原因，就在于此。”
