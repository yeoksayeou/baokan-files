    Shanghai Textile Workers Achieve Great Success in Learning Advanced Work Methods
    Large Numbers of Women Participate in the Construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Industry
    Nearly 140,000 female textile workers in Shanghai have achieved great success in learning advanced work methods, creating huge wealth for the country.
    In the past few years, female textile workers in Shanghai have made significant improvements in various aspects such as politics and culture, and the improvement in production technology is even more prominent. Since the popularization of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method in Shanghai, 94% of the fine yarn female workers and 84% of the weaving female workers in the city have learned and basically mastered these two advanced work methods. Thanks to their efforts, a large number of advanced workers have emerged. Among them, more than 64% of the fine yarn female workers have become Hao Jianxiu workers, and more than 70% of the weaving female workers have become 1951 Weaving Work Method workers. Their ability to watch spindles and looms has generally improved, while roller cotton waste and defective cloth rates have relatively decreased. Many advanced workers have not only mastered advanced work methods but also have some innovations. For example, Xiang Fengqi, a Hao Jianxiu worker from the state-owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, has taken the Hao Jianxiu Work Method a step further in mastering the patrol rules. Last August, she represented Chinese textile workers at the International Industrial Fair held in Leipzig, German Democratic Republic, where she demonstrated the Hao Jianxiu advanced work method and received unanimous praise from the audience. Yang Lanhua, a Hao Jianxiu worker from the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, has won three awards in a row because of her ability to grasp the time for changing roving and patrol rules. Last year, she represented Chinese textile workers at the Vienna World Peace Congress.
    Shanghai's female textile workers, with a glorious tradition of struggle, have also created many advanced operating experiences in the past year. Zhou Afeng, who attended this National Women's Congress, is the creator of the advanced "anti-knotting" experience. She created the anti-knotting of cone yarn, making the woven cloth smooth and shiny. This method has now been promoted throughout the city. According to statistics, the implementation of this method can save the country 3.1 billion yuan annually and improve the quality of cotton yarn. Liu Cuilian from the state-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory and the advanced roving workers of various factories collectively created the roving work method, reducing the breakage rate, which can save 260 million yuan annually for the No. 9 Factory alone.
    Thanks to the continuous improvement of technology and work by Shanghai's female textile workers, who account for more than 60% of Shanghai's textile workers, they have overfulfilled the production plans for yarn and cloth products in the first quarter of this year. Among them, the average unit output of cotton yarn exceeded the highest record in previous years. Now, they are preparing to respond to the decision of the Fifth Meeting of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union and launch a patriotic labor competition centered on reducing breakage and improving quality, striving to successfully complete the production plan for the second quarter.

    Large numbers of women in New China are participating in the construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Industry. According to statistics, more than 3,700 women are working in various positions in the basic construction departments and production departments of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone. Among them, more than 200 are assistant engineers and technicians, more than 1,600 are in administrative management positions such as section chiefs, factory (mine) directors, and clerks, more than 1,400 are workers in various jobs, and more than 400 apprentices are learning various technologies. Among these, more than 200 will become technicians in China's newest large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant after graduation.
    These female workers, who stand at the forefront of heavy industrial construction, are all competent in their positions, and many advanced figures have emerged. Wu Yulan, from the Electric Repair Factory, led the instrument repair team and has created two types of relays that were extremely scarce in the factory over the years, and created and improved seven production methods, greatly improving production efficiency and product quality. This team has become a famous model team in Anshan. Huang Demei, a planer from the Steel Pipe Factory, is a labor model in Anshan. She improved tools and created the highest new record in the factory during the increase production and practice economy movement last year, increasing production efficiency by two and a half times. Wu Yuanyu, a technician from the Iron Smelting Factory, encountered difficulties when she was first assigned to blast furnace duty at the beginning of last year because she often had to work night shifts and work in high temperatures. Many people thought it would be difficult for her to persevere, but she overcame these difficulties and managed the blast furnace very well because of her close integration with the workers and her serious and responsible attitude, which earned her awards from her superiors. Gong Zhaozhi, a technician from the Design Department, proposed an improvement to the pipeline device after repeated research when designing a certain pipeline last year, and personally went to the site to test it successfully, saving the country 4 billion yuan in investment. The female assistant engineers and technicians on the construction site often go deep into the site to check the quality of the project and direct the project. They often crawl under the steel rebar frame in foundation projects tens of feet deep, getting covered in oil. They are never afraid of difficulties and are therefore enthusiastically praised by the workers.
    The vast majority of these female technicians and workers are young students who have recently graduated from school, and some are girls from rural areas and housewives from cities. However, thanks to the cultivation of New China and their own hard work in studying their profession, they have become new types of people. For example, Han Shuxiang and other seven female workers who became tram drivers last year mastered the technology and drove the tram very well after only eight months of study and practical training. Zhao Gaoshi, a material selection worker at the Refractory Factory, has actively studied technology since she started working in 1949, and has created many new material selection records. Last year, she was promoted to administrative director of the magnesite brick workshop. In the past year alone, more than 180 female apprentices in Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been promoted to technicians and skilled workers, more than 50 female probationary technicians have been promoted to technicians, and more than 20 female employees have taken on administrative positions as section chiefs.

    上海纺织女工学习先进工作法有很大成就
    大批妇女参加鞍山钢铁工业建设工作
    上海市近十四万纺织女工学习先进工作法获得很大成就，替国家创造了巨大财富。
    几年来，上海纺织女工在政治、文化等各方面都有显著的提高，生产技术上的改进更是突出。自郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法在上海推广以后，全市已有百分之九十四的细纱女工和百分之八十四的织布女工学习并基本上掌握了这两个先进工作法。由于她们的努力，涌现出大批先进工作者。其中百分之六十四以上的细纱女工已成为郝建秀工作者，百分之七十以上的织布女工已成为一九五一织布工作法工作者，她们的看锭能力和看台能力普遍提高，皮辊花和次布率则相对降低。许多先进工作者不但掌握了先进工作法，而且还有某些创造。如国营上海第六棉纺织厂郝建秀工作者相凤祁在掌握巡回规律这一点上，就使郝建秀工作法推进了一步。去年八月，她代表中国纺织工人出席了在德意志民主共和国莱比锡举行的国际工业博览会，在会上表演了郝建秀先进工作法，受到观众的一致赞扬。国营上海第二棉纺织厂郝建秀工作者杨兰花，由于能掌握换粗纱的时间和巡回规律，一连得过三次奖。去年她代表中国纺织工人出席了维也纳世界和平代表大会。
    有光荣斗争传统的上海纺织女工，在过去一年中还创造了不少先进操作经验。出席这次全国妇女代表大会的周阿凤，就是“反结头”先进经验的创造者。她创造了筒子纱的反结头，使织出的布又平又光。现在这种工作法已推广全市。据统计：实行这个工作法每年可为国家节省人民币三十一亿元，并且提高了棉纱质量。国营上海第九棉纺织厂刘翠莲和各厂粗纱先进工作者集体创造了粗纱工作法，减低断头率，仅第九厂每年就可节省二亿六千万元。
    由于上海纺织女工不断提高技术，改进工作，女工占百分之六十以上的上海纺织工人已超额完成了今年第一季度纱、布产品的生产计划。其中棉纱平均单位产量超过历年来的最高纪录。现在，她们正准备响应纺织工会全国委员会第五次会议的决定，展开以减少断头提高质量为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛，为胜利完成第二季度的生产计划而努力。

    新中国成批妇女参加鞍山钢铁工业的建设工作。据统计，仅在国营鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门和生产部门担任各项工作的妇女已达三千七百多人，其中担任助理工程师、技术员等职务的有二百多人，担任处长、厂（矿）长、科长、职员等行政管理职务的有一千六百多人，各类工作的工人一千四百多人，另有徒工四百多人正在学习各种技术，其中二百多人毕业后，将成为我国最新式的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的技术工人。
    这些站在重工业建设岗位上的女工作者，都胜任自己的职务，并已出现了许多先进人物。电修厂武玉兰领导计器修理小组，几年来曾创造了两种厂内异常缺乏的继电器，并创造和改进了七种生产方法，大大提高了生产效率和产品质量。这个小组已成为鞍山著名的模范组。钢管厂刨工黄德梅是鞍山市劳动模范，她在去年增产节约运动中曾改进了工具，创造了全厂最高新纪录，提高生产效率两倍半。炼铁厂技术员吴元愉，去年初到高炉值班时，因为要经常值夜班，又是冒着高温工作，很多人认为她难以坚持下来，但她克服了这些困难，并因和工人密切结合，认真负责，把高炉管理得很好，得到上级的奖励。设计处技术员龚昭芝，在去年设计某项管道时，经过反复研究，提出一件改进管道装置的建议，并亲到现场试验成功，为国家节省了四十亿元的投资。在工地上的女助理工程师和女技术员们，经常深入现场检查工程质量和指挥工程进行。她们常常钻在钢筋架下数丈深的基础工程中，爬行着工作，弄得满身油污，她们从不怕困难，因而受到工人们热烈赞扬。
    这些女技术人员和工人，绝大多数都是离校不久的青年学生，有的是来自农村的姑娘和城市的家庭妇女。但是新中国的培养和她们自己刻苦钻研业务的结果，她们已成为新型的人物。如去年成为电车头司机的韩淑香等七名女工，仅仅经过八个多月的学习和实际锻炼，就掌握了技术，把电车开得很好。耐火厂选料工赵高石一九四九年参加工作以来，积极钻研技术，曾创造多次选料新纪录，去年已被提拔为镁砖车间的行政主任。在去年一年中，鞍山钢铁公司就有一百八十多名女徒工升为技术工人和熟练工人，有五十多名女见习技术员升为技术员，并有二十多名女职员担负起科长的行政职务。
