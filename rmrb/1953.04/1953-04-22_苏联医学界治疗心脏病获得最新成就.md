Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 21st: The newspaper "Pravda" published on the 17th Professor A. Bakulev's statement to a TASS correspondent regarding the latest achievements of Soviet medical circles in treating heart disease.

Bakulev said that for centuries, surgeons had not dared to operate on the heart. However, as early as the end of the last century, Russian medical professionals made significant progress in the surgical treatment of heart injuries. They were the first to successfully suture heart wounds and major blood vessels. Currently, surgeons in many Soviet hospitals and clinics can perform surgery for heart injuries.

Bakulev mentioned that a few years ago, a young girl with congenital heart disease came to his clinic seeking treatment. The girl suffered from a common heart condition: in normal blood circulation, the two blood circulations, which should not be connected outside the heart, were connected through the so-called Botallo's duct (ductus arteriosus), resulting in a large portion of blood returning immediately after leaving the heart without reaching the body's tissues. After detailed research, Professor Bakulev decided to save the patient with surgery. This type of surgery is extremely difficult, and sometimes the patient's pulse and breathing stop. Therefore, blood transfusions and other measures are needed. Finally, the surgery was successful, and normal blood circulation was restored. The girl is now living a healthy life. Bakulev pointed out that this type of surgery is no longer a rarity for Soviet surgeons.

Bakulev added that patients with various other heart diseases also come to his clinic for treatment. Mastering cardiac surgery is essential to cure their serious illnesses. He, Professor R. Bogoslovsky, Lecturer E. Mishalkin, and others have been working together to solve this problem.

They conducted experiments on animals for three years and studied the results of many experiments by other Soviet scientists. They particularly thoroughly studied the experiments of N. Terebinsky, who had performed dozens of surgeries on animal hearts. During the surgeries, he used methods to temporarily stop the heart's activity and replace it with artificial blood circulation.

Bakulev also mentioned the great value of the experiments of N. Sinitsyn and V. Demikhov. They performed heart transplant surgeries on dogs and other animals using hearts from the same species and replaced the original heart and lungs with others. He said that the clinic encountered many significant difficulties in performing intracardiac surgery, but these difficulties were overcome with the help of the achievements of Soviet medical professionals, the experiments of scientists, and the help of Ivan Pavlov's theory, which made new contributions to the physiology of blood circulation.

Performing heart surgery carries the risk of massive bleeding. During the surgery, surgeons must transplant several segments of blood vessels. The method of long-term preservation of blood vessels invented by Soviet medical professionals provided surgeons with transplant materials. Synthetic drugs invented by Soviet pharmacists prevent blood from clotting after surgery. Arterial transfusion and artificial respiration invented by V. Negovsky must be performed during surgery on the heart and major blood vessels. New methods are also used to determine the nature of heart disease. Injecting a special solution that is opaque to X-rays into the heart allows for very clear X-ray images to be obtained when taking X-rays.

Bakulev concluded by saying that the clinic's staff began systematically performing surgeries for this condition two years ago. Since then, many children and young people with congenital heart disease have successfully undergone surgery. Acquired heart disease can also be effectively treated surgically. The results have proven that surgical treatment can be performed on blood vessels and heart muscle; overcoming each difficulty in this area is a new contribution to surgical medicine.

    苏联医学界治疗心脏病获得最新成就
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十七日登载了亚·巴库列夫教授就苏联医学界治疗心脏病的最新成就对塔斯社记者发表的谈话。
    巴库列夫说，多少世纪以来，外科医生都不敢动心脏。然而早在上一个世纪末，俄国医学界人士在心脏创伤的外科手术方面就有了很大的发展。他们是首先顺利地缝合心脏创伤和大血管的人。目前，苏联许多医院和诊疗所的外科医生都可以为心脏创伤施行手术。
    巴库列夫谈到了几年以前一个患先天性心脏病的女孩子到他的诊疗所来求治的事。这个女孩子患的是一种普通的心脏病：在正常血液循环中本来是在心外不相联通的两个血液循环，由于通过所谓波太尔氏管（动脉导管）而联通了，结果就使很大一部分血液在离开心脏后没有到达有机体的组织就立即流回来了。巴库列夫教授在经过详细的研究后，决定以外科手术治疗来拯救这个病人。这种手术是非常难做的，有些时候病人的脉搏和呼吸都停止了。因此，就需要输血和采取其他的措施。最后，这个手术做成功了，正常的血液循环恢复了。这个女孩子现在很健康地生活着。巴库列夫指出：目前，这种手术对苏联外科医生说来已不是稀罕的事了。
    巴库列夫又说，患其他各种心脏病的病人也到他的诊疗所来求治。要治愈他们的严重疾病必须掌握心脏外科手术。他和鲁·波戈斯洛夫斯基教授、叶·米沙尔金讲师等一直在共同努力解决这个问题。
    他们在动物身上作了三年实验并且研究了其他苏联科学家的许多实验的结果。他们特别透彻地研究了尼·捷列宾斯基的实验，后者曾经在动物的心脏上做过数十次手术。在做手术时，他使用了使心脏暂时停止活动而用人工血液循环来代替的方法。
    巴库列夫还谈到了尼·西尼津和维·杰米哈夫的实验的重大价值。他们在狗和其他动物身上作过移植同种动物的心脏的手术和用别的心肺来代替原有心肺的手术。他说：诊疗所在施行心内手术时遇到不少重大的困难，但是，这些困难在苏联医学界人士的成就的帮助下，在科学家的实验和对血液循环生理学有新贡献的伊凡·巴夫洛夫学说的帮助下，都得到克服了。
    施行心脏手术是有大量流血的危险的。在施行手术时，外科医生必须移植若干段血管。苏联医学界人士发明的长期保藏血管的方法，使外科医生有了移植的材料。苏联药剂师发明的合成药使血液在施行手术后不致凝固。在施行心脏和大血管的手术时必须施行维·湼戈夫斯基发明的动脉输血法和人工呼吸法。同时还使用新的方法来断定心脏病的性质。把一种用爱克斯光照不透的特殊溶液导入心脏，就使得在利用爱克斯光来照相时能够得到很清晰的爱克斯光照片。
    巴库列夫最后说，两年前诊疗所的工作者已开始有系统地做这种病症的手术。从那时起，就有许多患先天性心脏病的儿童和青年顺利地行过了手术。后天性的心脏病也能作有效的手术。结果证明可以在血管和心肌来实行外科手术治疗；在这方面的每一种困难的克服，都是外科医学中的新贡献。
