Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 22nd: Our sick and wounded captured personnel, who have returned to the embrace of the motherland after suffering all kinds of torment from the enemy, have immediately received excellent treatment and warm care.

　　The reporter visited the hospital that is accommodating the sick and wounded captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. After a day of quarantine, treatment, and rest, the wounded have been changed into new bandages. The patients have just taken their medicine, some are reading newspapers and books sent from the motherland, and some are playing cards. Nurses are delivering boiled water to each ward, taking care of the seriously ill and seriously injured, and making them comfortable in their beds. Members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's cultural troupe are visiting each ward to offer comfort, bringing cigarettes, candies, and consolation bags from the motherland. Smiles have reappeared on the faces of the sick and wounded, and they are constantly waving to the newly arrived sick and wounded personnel.

　　Thirty-two of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war received on the 20th have tuberculosis. This is the result of long-term malnutrition. These patients have sallow complexions and are as thin as skeletons. One patient pointed to the scars on his head and waist for the reporter, marks left by the enemy's beatings in the prisoner-of-war camp. After being brutally beaten by the enemy, he slept in blood-soaked clothes on the cold, damp ground, and ate a mixed coarse meal of seven kinds of grains, including barley, wheat kernels, and sorghum, which led to his tuberculosis. Now the doctors have given him cough medicine, painkillers, vitamin pills, and nutritious food, including milk and sugar.

　　In the surgical hospital, personnel who were maimed by the enemy's beatings or by improper medical treatment are being accommodated. One wounded soldier said that after he was wounded in the forehead, the enemy only bandaged him and then ignored him. As a result, he lost sight in his right eye and his left eyeball was removed. When he arrived at our hospital, his right eye was still full of pus and blood. The medical staff washed the pus and blood out of his eye with medicine, reapplied ointment to the wound, and someone fed him when he ate. Doctors said that his right eye might still recover, and he might regain his sight. Another gaunt and emaciated wounded soldier said that he had been paralyzed in bed for nearly two years; he was wounded in the back, but the enemy only gave him a blanket; due to constant friction, he also suffered from bedsores on his coccyx, and the wound later expanded to the size of a fist; because the enemy did not disinfect the urinals used by the patients, he also developed urethritis. The enemy drew his blood before each treatment, and he had been drawn more than thirty times in the past two years, six times in July of last year alone. Soon after he returned to our side, the doctors applied ointment to his wounds, injected him with glucose solution, and performed other possible preliminary treatments.

　　These sick and wounded captured personnel were deeply moved by the good treatment and kind care they received. They said: We are grateful to the Korean people, the people of the motherland, and the comrades in arms at the front, who fought heroically with the enemy, so that we could escape from hell and gain freedom.

### 回到祖国怀抱的我方病伤被俘人员  立即受到了良好的治疗和热情的照顾

    回到祖国怀抱的我方病伤被俘人员
    立即受到了良好的治疗和热情的照顾
    【新华社开城二十二日电】遭受敌人百般摧残以后回到祖国怀抱的我方病伤被俘人员，立即得到了良好的治疗和热情的照顾。
    记者访问了收容中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员的医院。经过一天的检疫、治疗和休息，伤员们已经换上新的绷带。病员们刚刚服下药品，有的正在看祖国运来的书报，有的在玩纸牌。看护员们正到各病房送开水，他们照顾着重病和重伤人员，让他们安适地睡在病床上。中国人民志愿军的文工团员们在各病室进行慰问，他们带来了香烟、糖果和祖国的慰问袋。病伤人员的脸上重新露出了笑容，他们连连和今天新到的病伤人员招手。
    二十日接收的中国人民志愿军被俘人员中有三十二个人是肺病。这是长期营养不良的结果。这些病员面色焦黄，骨瘦如柴。一个病员指着头上、腰部的伤疤给记者看，这是在战俘营中遭受敌人毒打的痕迹。他在被敌人毒打以后，穿着血衣，睡在冰冷潮湿的地上，吃的是大麦、小麦粒、高粱等七种谷物的混合糙饭，因而得了肺病。现在医生们给了他止咳药，止痛药，维他命丸，并给了他富有营养的食品，包括牛奶和砂糖。
    在外科医院里，收容着遭受敌人毒打或因医疗不当而弄成残废的人员。一个伤员说，他在额部负伤后，敌人只给他扎上绷带，就再也不管了，他因此右眼失明，左眼球被摘除。他到达我方病院时，右眼里还充满脓血。医务人员们用药水把他眼里的脓血洗净，伤口上重新敷好药膏，吃饭时有人喂他。医生们说，他的右眼还可能痊愈，他还可能重见光明。另一个黄瘦不堪的伤员说，他近两年来一直瘫痪在病床上；他的背部负伤，而敌人却只发给他一条毯子；由于经常磨擦，他的尾椎骨处又患了褥疮，后来伤口扩大到有拳头大小；因为敌人不把病人用的排尿器消毒，他又得了尿道炎。敌人在每次治疗前都要他抽血，两年来他已被抽血三十多次，仅在去年七月就被抽了六次血。在他回到我方后不久，医生们就给他在伤处敷上药膏，注射了葡萄糖液，进行了其他可能的初步治疗。
    这些病伤被俘人员得到良好的治疗和亲切的照顾以后，都十分感动。他们说：我们感激朝鲜人民、祖国人民和前方的战友们，他们和敌人作了英勇的斗争，才使我们从地狱里出来获得了自由。
