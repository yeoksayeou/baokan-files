To the esteemed Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
    We, the entire body of delegates to the Second National Women's Congress of China, with full enthusiasm, representing the broad masses of women of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all different professions, and all different religious beliefs in the country, as well as all the families of the Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, extend to you our cordial greetings and lofty respect.
    At this conference, we discussed and summarized the women's movement of the past four years, and determined the tasks for the future, in order to further mobilize and unite the women of the country to actively participate in the national construction cause, and to strive for the victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the realization of the national construction plan.
    Dear commanders and combatants, because you have fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army on the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and achieved great victories, the U.S. government has had to agree to reopen the truce talks; because of your heroic fighting, the motherland has been able to enter a great period of economic construction. Therefore, our women across the country can participate more in various construction undertakings, and together with the people of the whole country, move towards a happier life.
    We, the delegates present, hereby assure you: under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we will resolutely implement the resolutions of the conference, and strive for greater achievements in the Chinese women's movement, and for the defense of Asian and world peace and against wars of aggression.
        The Entire Body of Delegates to the Second National Women's Congress of China
         April 23rd

    向中国人民志愿军致敬电敬爱的彭德怀司令员并中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    我们中国第二次全国妇女代表大会的全体代表们，以满腔的热情，代表着全国各民族、各民主阶级、各种不同职业、各种不同宗教信仰的广大妇女群众，以及全体志愿军、人民解放军家属们，向您们致亲切的慰问和崇高的敬礼。
    我们在这次大会上，讨论总结了四年来的妇女运动，决定了今后的任务，为更进一步地动员和团结全国妇女积极参加国家建设事业，为争取抗美援朝斗争的胜利和实现国家的建设计划而努力奋斗。
    亲爱的全体指挥员、战斗员同志们，由于你们在抗美援朝的最前线与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，取得了伟大胜利，使得美国政府不得不同意重开停战谈判；由于你们的英勇作战，使得祖国能够进入伟大的经济建设时期。因而，我们全国妇女能够更多地参加到各种建设事业中去，与全国人民一起，向着更幸福的生活迈进。
    我们到会的全体代表谨向你们保证：我们要在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，坚决实现大会决议，为争取中国妇女运动更大的成就，为保卫亚洲与世界和平、反对侵略战争而奋斗。
        中国第二次全国妇女代表大会全体代表
         四月二十三日
