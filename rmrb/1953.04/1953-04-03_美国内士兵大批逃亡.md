Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 1st. At the beginning of this year, after newspapers revealed the large-scale desertion of soldiers within the United States who were unwilling to go to Korea to fight, the U.S. military authorities hastily issued contradictory statements to try to cover up the situation. At that time, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel of the Army Department, Lieutenant General McAuliffe, admitted in one of his statements on January 7 that there were numerous desertions, but glossed over the fact by saying that in most cases, the soldiers were only "absent without leave" and later returned to their units. However, the March 20th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, in an article introducing the penalties imposed by the Department of Defense on these so-called "absent without leave" soldiers, revealed the truth about these so-called "absent without leave" incidents.

The article stated: "Many young draftees, after receiving seventeen weeks of basic training and serving in their states for some time, have adopted a method to stay in the United States until they can no longer be sent to serve in Korea. The method is to leave their posts without permission for a period of time, and then sit in an army prison. According to army regulations, in order for a person to be sent to Korea, he must have at least nine months of service remaining. The method is to first be 'absent without leave,' then sit in jail, thereby spending enough time in the United States so that he has less than nine months of service remaining." (Note: Under the current U.S. conscription law, the term of service for conscripted soldiers is two years.)

According to the magazine, many soldiers who adopted this method deliberately failed to report to the designated location after receiving orders to be sent abroad, and instead reported to another unit after the designated reporting date. This way, he would not be treated as a "deserter" and only bear the charge of being "absent without leave," sit in jail for a few months, and then wear away enough time to avoid being sent to the Korean battlefield.

Thus, the magazine confirmed that what the U.S. military authorities were trying to cover up with the so-called "absent without leave" was this important fact: a large number of forcibly conscripted American youths were trying every means to avoid going to Korea to fight.

McAuliffe admitted that an average of 20,000 soldiers were "absent without leave" each month, of which 3,000 never returned to their units. This number is equivalent to approximately half of the average monthly conscription number in the United States in the second half of last year.

The U.S. Department of Defense is using brutal means to treat these soldiers who evade being sent to Korea as cannon fodder, by offering rewards for their arrest and, at the same time, escorting these soldiers who have been caught or who have returned to their units because they believe the danger has passed to the mustering points of the expeditionary forces, and then putting them on planes and sending them to Korea.

    美国内士兵大批逃亡
    【新华社一日讯】华盛顿消息，今年年初，美国军事当局曾经因为报纸透露了美国国内士兵因不愿到朝鲜去打仗而大量逃亡的情形，慌忙发出了前后自相矛盾的声明企图进行掩饰。当时陆军部负责人事的助理参谋长麦克奥里夫中将在他一月七日发表的一个这样的声明中承认逃亡众多，但粉饰说，在大多数情况下，士兵只是“擅离职守”，后来又归了队。但是，三月二十日的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在一篇介绍国防部对于这种所谓“擅离职守”士兵采取的惩罚措施的文章中，却透露了这些所谓“擅离职守”事件的真相。
    文章说：“许多年青的被征入伍者在接受了十七个星期的基本训练和在州里服役一些时候之后，采取了一种办法，使自己留在美国，直到可以不再被派去朝鲜服役，办法是不请假而离职一个时期，再坐陆军监狱。按照陆军条例，一个人要被送到朝鲜去，他必须还剩下有至少九个月的服役期。这个办法就是先‘擅离职守’，然后坐牢，这样在美国消磨足够的时间，以至他所剩服役期不足九个月。”（按：美国现行征兵法，被征士兵服役期限是两年。）
    据该杂志说，许多采取这种办法的士兵在接到派遣出国令之后故意不到指定地点报到，而在过了指定报到日期后再到另一单位报到，这样他可以不致被当作“逃兵”处分，而只担个“擅离职守”的罪名，坐几个月牢，就可以磨过去足够的时间，避免被送往朝鲜战场。
    这样，这个杂志就证实了，美国军事当局用所谓“擅离职守”所企图掩饰的是这样一个重要事实：大量被强征入伍的美国青年想尽办法避免到朝鲜去作战。
    麦克奥里夫承认，这种“擅离职守”的士兵每月平均有两万人，其中有三千根本就不再归队。这个数目相当于美国去年下半年每月平均征兵数目的大约一半。
    美国国防部用暴虐的手段对待这些规避到朝鲜去当炮灰的士兵，办法是：悬赏缉拿，同时把被抓回或认为危险时期已过而归队了的这些士兵押解到出征军队集合地点，然后装进飞机把他们送到朝鲜去。
