Introduction to the Mazowsze Polish Song and Dance Ensemble of the People's Republic of Poland

The Mazowsze Polish Song and Dance Ensemble of the People's Republic of Poland is an artistic troupe composed of young farmers and young workers with artistic talent and excellent moral character, performing entirely Polish folk music and dance.

In 1948, the People's Republic of Poland began a new economic and cultural construction. The excellent Putnitski Folk Song and Dance Ensemble, led by the famous Soviet musician Zakharov, visited Poland that year. In order to learn from the successful experience of the Soviet Union in developing national art, the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art decided to establish a folk song and dance ensemble to discover the many wonderful treasures in Polish folk art, and appointed the outstanding musician Tadeusz Sygietyński, who was knowledgeable about folk art, to be responsible for the preparatory work and organizational leadership of the ensemble.

In 1949, Sygietyński began preparing for the ensemble. Because the Mazowsze region, where the city of Warsaw, the capital of central Poland, is located, has an excellent folk music tradition, the ensemble was named "Mazowsze." The address of the ensemble was chosen in Karolin, a scenic area near Warsaw. In order to select actors from the folk, Sygietyński went to many villages in various provinces of Poland, carefully listening to and observing the singing and dancing of young men and women in rural clubs and amateur workers' troupes. Newspapers and radio also spread the news of the formation of the ensemble throughout the country. In this way, 5,000 young men and women applied, and after preliminary selection, 500 people were retained in Karolin. After some training and re-selection, more than 100 people were retained to officially form the ensemble.

The purpose of the ensemble's training is to give the members some training in vocal music, instrumental music, and dance in a scientific way, so as to develop their artistic talents. However, the training should avoid the singing style of the opera house as much as possible and prevent the learners from simply imitating the postures of classical dance, but require their performances not to lose the characteristics of folk art. At the same time, the members must also study science and general cultural subjects equivalent to the middle school level in the ensemble. The members train in the ensemble for three years and work for three years; after receiving training, they can choose any profession and can be song and dance instructors for amateur art groups. Those with special talents discovered in the ensemble are sent to the conservatory to study, but they still participate in the ensemble's rehearsals and performances. When the members of the ensemble who have completed their training transfer to other schools, another group of new young men and women are recruited. In this way, the members of the ensemble are always young people.

The person in charge of the ensemble, Sygietyński, and others traveled to various rural areas to interview and record the various ancient folk songs that the old male and female farmers could remember in order to discover folk music. Rural singers and musicians also often came to Karolin to perform, and Sygietyński recorded the tunes, themes, and melodies of their performances each time. The dancer Yevgeny Paparinski, who is responsible for the dance technology of the ensemble, also collected many folk dance styles, just like Sygietyński collected folk songs.

The ensemble generally does not perform the collected folk songs and dances without any changes, but first undergoes strict selection and even comprehensive integration, but these programs must be as faithful as possible to the original lyrics of the folk songs and the original emotions and colors of the music and dance. Many of the programs have been carefully processed after careful study. Because of this, the ensemble often turns some folk creations that lack artistry into national art and the art of the modern Polish people. The costumes of the ensemble were designed by the famous Polish actress Mira Ziminska. She was also the first to go to various rural areas to collect ancient and authentic folk costumes, and then selected, integrated, and studied how to tailor them and how to match patterns and laces. The costumes of the ensemble are very elegant and beautiful, and also maintain the folk style.

The work of the ensemble has been supported by all parties. Many outstanding Polish artists often visit Karolin, cooperate with the ensemble, and help the ensemble finally complete the various song and dance works in the performance program.

The ensemble's performances are beautiful, pleasant, and have a strong youthful appeal. Many programs come from the folk, and its themes and contents are closely related to the feelings of the masses. In addition to performing Polish songs and dances, the ensemble also performs folk art works from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries.

The ensemble's first performance in 1950 was a great success. The Polish people believe that the appearance of this song and dance ensemble is an amazing artistic miracle. Then its performances throughout Poland were successful. The working people of Poland love this song and dance ensemble very much and often send it hundreds and thousands of letters. The achievements of this song and dance ensemble have greatly promoted the development of Polish national culture, and many folk-based song and dance ensembles have been established throughout Poland. In 1951, the ensemble won the Polish First Class National Award, and in January 1953, it won the Polish Second Class Labor Flag Award.

The ensemble is also welcomed when performing abroad. In January 1951, it visited the Soviet Union; in September of the same year, it won an award at the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin and visited the German Democratic Republic. In addition, the ensemble has also visited Hungary and Czechoslovakia. In January 1953, the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble visited the Soviet Union for the second time and won the highest honor. The ensemble performed music and dance programs at the Soviet National Grand Theater in Moscow, and Stalin, Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov attended the ensemble's performance. The Soviet government awarded the ensemble a high bonus of 200,000 rubles. Because of the ensemble's achievements, it is praised as the "Flower of Eastern Europe."

There are 79 male members and 74 female members visiting our country this time. The head of the delegation, Andrzej Panufnik, is a prominent contemporary Polish composer and conductor, and vice chairman of the Polish Composers Union. His works include "Peace Symphony" and "Ancient Polish Suite." He has won many awards in Poland and abroad.

    波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团介绍
    波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团是一个由具有艺术天才和优良的道德品质的青年农民和青年工人组成的、完全表演波兰民间音乐舞蹈的艺术团。
    一九四八年，波兰人民共和国开始了新的经济建设和文化建设。苏联著名音乐家扎哈罗夫所领导的优秀的普特尼斯基民间歌舞团在这一年访问了波兰。为了学习苏联发扬民族艺术的成功经验，波兰文化艺术部决定成立一个民间歌舞团，以发掘波兰民间艺术中的许多美妙的宝藏；并委任了卓越的通晓民间艺术的音乐家塔捷乌诗·塞格廷斯基担任歌舞团的筹备工作和组织领导工作。
    一九四九年，塞格廷斯基开始筹备歌舞团。因为波兰中部华沙城所在的玛佐夫舍地区素有优秀的民间音乐传统，歌舞团就被命名为“玛佐夫舍”。歌舞团的地址选在华沙附近的风景区卡洛林。为了从民间挑选演员，塞格廷斯基曾到波兰各省的许多村庄，仔细地倾听和观察农村俱乐部和工人业余剧团的青年男女们的唱歌和跳舞。报纸和广播又把筹组歌舞团的消息传遍了全国。这样，就有五千个青年男女来报名，初步选拔后有五百人留在卡洛林。经过一定的训练和再次挑选，留下来一百多人，正式组成了歌舞团。
    歌舞团的训练目的是以科学的方法给团员一些声乐、器乐和舞蹈方面的训练，以发展他们的艺术才能。但训练上却尽量避免歌剧院式的歌唱风格和防止学习者单纯模仿古典舞的姿态，而要求他们的表演不失去民间艺术的特点。同时，团员在团内还要学习相当于中学水平的科学和普通文化科目。团员们在歌舞团中训练三年，工作三年；受过训练后可以选择任何职业，并且可以当业余艺术团体的歌舞教员。歌舞团中发现具有特别才能的人，就派他们到音乐院去学习，但他们仍参加歌舞团的练习和演出。到一定的时候歌舞团里已经训练满期的团员转入别的学校，另吸收一批新的青年男女进来。这样，歌舞团的团员就经常是青年人。
    歌舞团的负责人塞格廷斯基等为了发掘民间音乐，曾走遍各农村采访和记录年老的男女农民们所能记忆的各种各样的古老的民歌。农村的歌手和音乐家也经常到卡洛林来表演，塞格廷斯基每次都把他们表演的曲调、主题和旋律记下来。歌舞团负责舞蹈技术的舞蹈家叶夫格尼·巴帕林斯基，也和塞格廷斯基搜集民歌一样，搜集了许多民间的舞蹈样式。
    歌舞团对搜集来的各种民间歌舞，一般都不是原封不动地上演，而是先要经过严格的选择，甚至加以综合，但这些节目又都必须尽可能忠实地保持民歌原来的歌词和音乐舞蹈原来的情绪和色彩。许多的节目都在很好地研究之后给予了细致的加工。由于这样，歌舞团也常常把某些比较缺乏艺术性的民间创作变成了全民的艺术、现代波兰人民的艺术。歌舞团的服装是波兰的著名演员米拉·齐明斯卡娅设计的。她也是首先到各农村去搜集古老的真正的民间服装，然后加以选择、综合，研究怎样剪裁，怎样配花样和花边。歌舞团的服装十分优雅和美丽动人，又保持着民间风格。
    歌舞团的工作，得到各方面的支持。波兰的许多杰出艺术家常常访问卡洛林，和歌舞团合作，帮助歌舞团最后完成演出节目中的各种歌舞作品。
    歌舞团的演出节目都是优美、愉快，具有强烈的青春感染力。许多节目来自民间，它的主题、内容都是亲切地和广大群众的心情联系着。除演波兰歌舞外，歌舞团还表演苏联和各人民民主国家的民间艺术作品。
    一九五○年歌舞团首次上演，就获得极大的成功。波兰人民认为这个歌舞团的出现是惊人的艺术奇迹。接着它在波兰各地的演出都获得成功。波兰的劳动人民异常喜爱这个歌舞团，经常地给它寄来成百成千的信件。这个歌舞团的成就大大促进了波兰民族文化的发展，许多以民间创作为基础的歌舞团在波兰各地成立起来了。一九五一年，歌舞团获得波兰一等国家奖金，一九五三年一月又获得波兰二等劳动奖旗。
    歌舞团在国外表演也受到欢迎。一九五一年一月它访问了苏联；同年九月它在柏林第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节上得奖，并访问了德意志民主共和国。此外，歌舞团还曾经访问过匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克。一九五三年一月，玛佐夫舍歌舞团第二次访问了苏联，并获得最高的荣誉。歌舞团在莫斯科苏联国家大剧院表演了音乐舞蹈节目，斯大林、马林科夫、贝利亚、莫洛托夫都出席观看了歌舞团的表演。苏联政府授给了歌舞团以很高的奖金——二十万卢布。由于歌舞团的成绩，它被称颂为“东欧之花”。
    这次来我国访问的有男团员七十九人，女团员七十四人。团长安德烈·潘努夫尼克是波兰当代杰出的作曲家和指挥家、波兰作曲家联盟副主席，他的作品有“和平交响乐”、“古老的波兰组曲”等，他曾经在波兰国内国外多次获奖。
