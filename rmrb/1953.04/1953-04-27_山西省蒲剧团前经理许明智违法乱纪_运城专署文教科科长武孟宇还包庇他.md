In October 1952, when actors from the Shanxi Province Pu Opera Experimental Troupe (hereinafter referred to as the Pu Opera Troupe) came to Beijing to participate in the First National Opera Observation and Performance Conference, they reported that Xu Mingzhi (probationary Communist Party member), the troupe's manager and associate, was engaging in illegal and disciplinarily violating behavior such as embezzlement, waste, seducing family members of actors, and harassing female actors. At the same time, Wu Mengyu, head of the Yuncheng Prefectural Cultural and Educational Section, shielded Xu Mingzhi, disrespected and oppressed the artists. After their erroneous behavior was exposed, Xu Mingzhi only received a public warning within the Party, and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Cultural Bureau only gave him one administrative warning and transferred him to another troupe as an instructor. The Pu Opera Troupe expressed dissatisfaction with this "lenient treatment." After the opera performance conference, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government transferred Xu and Wu to Beijing to investigate the matter in person. They admitted most of the illegal and disciplinarily violating facts, proving that the original punishment was indeed too light.

The facts of Xu Mingzhi and Wu Mengyu's oppression of artists and illegal and disciplinarily violating behavior are as follows:

The Pu Opera Troupe was reorganized from the Pu Opera Society Direct Troupe in January 1951 and often toured various counties and villages in the Yuncheng area. In February of the same year, Xu Mingzhi, a cadre sent by the Shanxi Provincial Drama Association, was appointed as the manager and associate of the troupe.

The Pu Opera Troupe was privately owned and publicly assisted, striving for economic self-sufficiency. However, Xu Mingzhi drew a very high salary within the troupe and arbitrarily spent money by reporting less than the actual amount and reporting non-existent items. During the "Three-Anti" movement, it was found that he had embezzled more than 3 million yuan of public funds and borrowed more than 3 million yuan.

Another egregious behavior of Xu Mingzhi was using his position as manager to engage in illicit relationships with women within the troupe, successively seducing two family members of actors, and being involved with another actor's family member, behaving like husband and wife, creating a negative impact among the masses. People discussed it a lot, and some people offered him advice, but he ignored them. An actor wrote "coming openly and going secretly" on the mirror while putting on makeup backstage. When Xu Mingzhi saw it, he was furious and wrote on the mirror with a face painting brush: "Coming openly and going openly, a hero acts like a hero." The next day, he convened a meeting and said to everyone: "Whoever speaks must be responsible, it only counts if you are caught in person. Who said it first? We must find this person." From then on, the masses dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out, and Xu Mingzhi became even more brazen in "coming openly and going secretly" with that actor's family member. The troupe asked the local County Party Committee for instructions, and the County Party Committee also agreed to clarify this issue, but Xu Mingzhi still refused to confess.

Xu Mingzhi's illegal and disciplinarily violating behavior was shielded and supported by Wu Mengyu, head of the Yuncheng Prefectural Cultural and Educational Section. Wu Mengyu consistently disrespected artists. When the "Three-Anti" movement began, the Yuncheng Prefectural Office transferred Xu back to participate in study sessions. During this period, Wu Mengyu still wanted the troupe to pay Xu's salary. The actors said, "We can't pay to support a whoremonger." Wu Mengyu said, "Paying to support him is one thing, and him messing around with your family members is another." He even convened a full troupe meeting overnight to address this matter. He said, "You have no regard for the government, you want to rebel, you are simply hoodlums and bandits!" He wanted to detain the actors overnight and insisted on finding out who was "instigating" them. However, the troupe had to go to the countryside to perform the next day and had to leave, so they had to beg Wu Mengyu: "We have no knowledge, we are all rough people, good Section Chief Wu, we will pay." The actors agreed to pay, and Wu Mengyu released them, but detained the deputy manager and an actor to reflect for five days. The entire troupe's morale was completely ruined by this incident.

Wu Mengyu had the responsibility to lead the troupe, but he never took care of the troupe's economic well-being. Last year, he transferred them back to the Prefectural Office to perform five times in half a year, without giving them any money, leaving everyone with no food or lodging, not even a word of consolation. Sometimes, in order to comply with the order to return to the Prefectural Office to perform, the troupe had to cancel contracted performances. Even when farmers built a stage and drove carts into the city according to the contract to pick them up, the Prefectural Office would not let them go, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses.

Xu Mingzhi's illegal and disciplinarily violating behavior in the troupe and Wu Mengyu's bureaucratic and bad style violate the Party and the People's Government's policy of uniting and protecting artists, creating a negative impression of the Party and the People's Government among the masses. The Shanxi Provincial Party and government leading organs should deal with this seriously.

### 山西省蒲剧团前经理许明智违法乱纪  运城专署文教科科长武孟宇还包庇他

    山西省蒲剧团前经理许明智违法乱纪
    运城专署文教科科长武孟宇还包庇他
    一九五二年十月，山西省蒲剧实验剧团（以下简称蒲剧团）的演员来北京参加第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会的时候，反映了该剧团的经理兼协理员许明智（候补共产党员）贪污浪费、诱奸演员家属、调戏女演员等违法乱纪行为；同时山西省运城专署文教科科长武孟宇却包庇许明智，轻视并压迫艺人。他们的错误行为被揭露后，许明智在党内只受到当众警告处分，山西省人民政府文化局也只给了他一次行政警告，还把他调到另一剧团任指导员，武孟宇仍任原职。蒲剧团对于这样的“从轻发落”表示不满。戏曲会演后，中央文化部调许、武二人来京当面调查此事，他们承认了大部违法乱纪事实，证明原来的处分的确太轻。
    许明智、武孟宇二人压迫艺人和违法乱纪的事实如下：
    蒲剧团是一九五一年一月由蒲剧学社直属剧团改组成的，经常在运城专区各县区村巡回演出。当年二月由山西省戏剧界协会派干部许明智担任该剧团经理兼协理员。
    蒲剧团是私营公助性质，经济上争取自给自足。但许明智在团内支着相当高的薪金，并通过以少报多，以无报有的手段，任意支钱。在“三反”运动中查出他贪污公款三百多万元，又借支三百多万元。
    许明智的另一恶劣行为，是利用经理的职权，在团内乱搞男女关系，先后诱奸两个演员家属，又和另一个演员家属勾搭，形如夫妇，在群众中造成恶劣影响，群众议论纷纷，并有人向他提意见，他都毫不理睬。有一个演员在后台化妆时在镜子上写了“明来暗去”四个字，许明智见了大怒，用画脸的笔在镜子上写：“明来明去，好汉作事好汉当。”第二天他召开大会，对大家说：“谁说话都要负责任，当面抓着才算。谁先说的？得追出这个人来。”群众从此敢怒而不敢言，许明智却更放肆地和那位演员家属“明来明去”了。该团请示当地中共县委，县委也同意搞清楚这个问题，但是许明智仍不认罪。
    许明智的违法乱纪行为，是得到运城专署文教科科长武孟宇的包庇和支持的。武孟宇一贯轻视艺人。当“三反”运动开始时，运城专署调许回去参加学习，在这一时期，武孟宇仍要剧团支给许薪金，演员们说：“我们不能出钱养嫖客。”武孟宇却说：“出钱养活他，和他搞你们家属，是两回事。”他并为这件事召集全团团员开了一夜大会，他说：“你们目无政府，要造反，简直是地痞流氓和土匪！”他要把演员们扣留一夜，一定要追查出谁在里边“挑唆”。但是该团第二天要到乡下演出，非走不可，只得哀求武孟宇道：“我们没知识，全是粗人，好武科长哩，我们出钱就是。”演员们答应了出钱，武孟宇才放行，但是扣下副经理和一名演员反省了五天。全体团员为这件事弄得情绪坏透了。
    武孟宇有领导该团的责任，但是一向毫不照顾该团的经济生活。去年在半年之内五次调他们回专署演戏，不给钱，使大家食宿都无着落，连一句慰劳的话也没有。有时该团为要奉调回到专署演戏，不得不把订了合同的戏回掉。甚至农民搭了戏台，赶了大车按合同进城来接他们，专署也不放，群众对此极为不满。
    许明智在剧团中的违法乱纪行为和武孟宇的官僚主义的恶劣作风，违反党和人民政府团结、保护艺人的政策，造成群众对党和人民政府的不良印象，山西省党政领导机关应加以严正处理。
