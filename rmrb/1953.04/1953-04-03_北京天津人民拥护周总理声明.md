Beijing and Tianjin People Support Premier Zhou's Statement

[This newspaper reports] The people of all circles in Beijing warmly support the statement issued successively by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Administration Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, on the Korean issue.

The responsible persons of various democratic parties in Beijing held a symposium on April 2. Jiang Guangnai, convener of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, Tao Dayong of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, Ling Qijun, Deputy Director of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Feng Binfu, Director of the Beijing Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Li Jiansheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and Xue Yu, Director of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society, all spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their support for Premier Zhou's statement and calling on people from all walks of life to resolutely support it with their greatest efforts.

The responsible persons of various people's organizations in Beijing unanimously expressed their warm support for Premier Zhou's statement. Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Farmers Association, Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, Xu Naiming, Chairman of the Beijing Students Federation, Lao She, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, and Fu Huating, Director of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, all delivered speeches, unanimously believing that Premier Zhou's statement fully expressed the sincere wishes of the Chinese and Korean people and fully conformed to the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. On behalf of the workers, peasants, women, students, literary and art workers, and industrialists and businessmen in Beijing, they firmly guaranteed that they would strive to fight to the end for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

In the past few days, the staff and workers of various factories and mines in Beijing have been vying to read the statements and related news on the Korean armistice negotiations published in the newspapers. Some factories also held symposiums, and the staff and workers enthusiastically expressed their opinions. Workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant, who are discussing production plans, have expressed their willingness to support Premier Zhou's statement with practical actions in production. Liu Dezhen, a national model worker in industry, said: I fully support Premier Zhou's statement. If American imperialism does not accept this proposal, which conforms to the interests of the people of the world, and dares to prolong the war, we will definitely support the Chinese People's Volunteers with all our strength until American imperialism is willing to stop. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have put forward the militant slogan of increasing production to support Premier Zhou's statement. Li Youzhi, a model worker in Beijing, led his entire team to formulate a specific plan to increase the hot blast stove temperature of the No. 1 blast furnace from 700 degrees to 800 degrees and the hot blast stove temperature of the No. 2 blast furnace from 650 degrees to 750 degrees to increase iron production. They are now studying the Soviet rapid combustion method and the steam blast fast charging method to ensure the realization of this plan. All factory and mine workers have proposed to handle the entire repatriation of prisoners of war issue in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Huang Runping, a model worker in Beijing and the founder of the Huang Runping warehouse management method, said: We firmly support Premier Zhou's statement and demand that the U.S. government act in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Zheng Jinhe, an employee of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, Chen Yongjie, a worker at the People's Machinery Factory, and many staff members of the Design Branch of the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau all said: Premier Zhou's proposal fully conforms to the vital interests of the Chinese and Korean people and the common interests of peace-loving people all over the world. The staff and workers all believe that if the U.S. government still believes in war and makes itself an enemy of peace-loving people all over the world, it will suffer an even more miserable defeat.

Faculty, students and staff of universities and colleges also expressed their warm support for Premier Zhou's statement. Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Peking University, published a written statement entitled "The Voice of the People," saying that when we read this historic document, we seemed to hear the roar of people all over the world eagerly demanding peace. Therefore, after this statement was issued, it was immediately warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. Liu Xianzhu, Vice President of Tsinghua University, Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Peking University, and Sun Qu, Deputy Provost of Agricultural University, all expressed their warm support for Premier Zhou's statement.

Family members of the Volunteers are deeply concerned and supportive of the peace proposals of our country and Korea. Huang Bangxu, the mother of Liao Yixun, said: I support peace and I support the Korean armistice, but I am not overly naive and I will not relax my vigilance. The reason I approved of my child joining the Volunteers was for the sake of peace. Now, I must encourage Yixun to work hard to achieve peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd. After the statements of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea, and Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union on the Korean issue were published, industrial model workers, people from industry and commerce, and students in Tianjin unanimously expressed their warm support. Pan Changyou, a national industrial model worker, said: These statements show our consistent and firm policy of safeguarding peace. The new proposal on the prisoner of war issue put forward in Premier Zhou's statement is the most reasonable way to resolve the prisoner of war issue. If the American aggressors dare to delay negotiations and expand the war, they will be strongly opposed by the people of the world. Zhao Guoyou, a national industrial model worker who is studying at the Cadre School of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: These three statements are completely in line with the vital interests of the Chinese and Korean people and the fundamental interests of the people of the world. Since the day the Korean War began, we have been striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Today, if the American aggressors disregard the desire for peace of the people of the world and still attempt to expand the war of aggression, our working class will exert even greater efforts to strengthen the resistance against America and aid Korea and strive for final victory. Zhu Jisheng, General Manager of Tianjin Renli Industrial Company, said: This is another expression of our consistent stance of adhering to peace. Whether the United Nations forces are truly willing to resolve the Korean issue is a major test. The students of Nankai University started discussions one after another when they returned to their dormitories after class. The students all believed that these statements fully demonstrated the unity of the peace and democracy camp and the determination to jointly strive for peace. All the students of the Cadre School of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have also proposed to express their support with practical actions such as doing a good job in their studies and doing a good job in patriotic health work.
