Reader's Letters Summary

    Chaotic Teaching at Shenyang Industrial Technical School
    A letter from 43 students including Chu Zhu and Xia Anmin of Shenyang Industrial Technical School: Our school's operating principles have never been clear, resulting in very chaotic teaching. Our school was established in September 1951, originally named "Shenyang Technical Cadre School." At that time, the school was of a specialized college nature, with three departments: Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, and Civil Engineering. The school recruited high school graduates in Shenyang (with an additional surveying class of a secondary technical education nature, recruiting junior high school graduates). However, there were also more than 200 students transferred from the Shenyang Municipal Administrative Cadre School, with very uneven educational levels, ranging from elementary school to high school graduates. This has added many difficulties to teaching and has not achieved the intended teaching results. After the summer of 1952, our school was changed to a secondary technical school and renamed Shenyang Industrial Technical School. But strangely, the school's curriculum is still selected from university courses, and there is no teaching plan or standard for progress. Courses are offered based on which teachers are available. Some courses that are taught in the fourth year of university are taught here in the first semester of the first year. Some courses are not finished last semester and are pushed to this semester, and if they are not finished this semester, they are pushed further down. For example, we studied two large volumes of Mechanical Principles this semester, which many students do not understand.
    When the school was changed to a secondary technical school, the school authorities did not handle reasonably the batch of students who were recruited in 1951 with high school diplomas and who had already studied two years of university courses, according to the spirit of the central government's adjustments to departments and faculties.
    Now many students in our school are emotionally uneasy. Some teachers and students have made positive suggestions to the school leaders to improve the school's work, but they have not been supported.

    Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Company Should Not Treat State Property with a Bureaucratic Attitude
    A letter from Bai Yulong, manager of Anguang County Grain Company, Heilongjiang Province: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on April 5 published a letter from reader Liu Suzhi, talking about our bureau's shipment of grain to Dezhou, where no consignee could be found, resulting in a fine of more than 2.8 million yuan in storage fees and causing the grain to become moldy. The reason for the mis-shipment of grain is currently under investigation. However, the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Company (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Company) treats this incident with a bureaucratic style, sitting idly by and watching the grain being damaged, which is intolerable.
    In early March, our company, according to the Provincial Company's notice, sent three cars (93 tons) of corn to Dezhou. Soon after, the Dezhou Railway Station sent a telegram saying that the receiving organization could not be found. We immediately inquired with the Storage and Transportation Section of the Provincial Company. Within ten days, we made a total of three phone calls. The comrade answering the phone always vaguely said, "Probably this way," "Maybe that way," "We will contact you again," "We will reply in a few days..." But the result was always no reply. We sent another telegram to urge them, but still no reply.
    Later, the Dezhou Grain Bureau also sent a telegram to inquire. We again asked the Secretariat Section of the Provincial Grain Bureau twice by phone, but they still did not tell us the solution. In order to solve this problem, our company has already sent the second manager, Zhang Guoyi, to Dezhou after contacting the Transportation Section of the Northeast Regional Grain Bureau. He has not yet returned. The irresponsible attitude of the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Company has caused a waste of manpower and resources. They should conduct a profound review of this.

    Jiangxi Qingjiang Fishermen Rescue State Property
    A letter from Huang Xuexin and Huang Lei of the Propaganda Department of the Qingjiang County Party Committee, Jiangxi: On March 22, a "Dazhong" steamer sailed from Ji'an in the Gan River, towing five large civilian boats, fully loaded with rice. When the boat reached under the Zhangshu Iron Bridge in our county, one of the civilian boats was overturned by an old iron bridge pier due to the sharp rise in the river and the strong wind and waves, and all the more than 600 bags of rice loaded on it fell into the river. In order to rescue state property, the fishermen of Zhangshu, Sanglin, and Zoucun along the river in our county automatically organized 82 fishing boats and more than 160 laborers on March 25, using a four-toothed small iron anchor hooking and salvaging method, and salvaged for two days in heavy rain and huge waves. As a result, 400 bags of rice were recovered. After these rice were salvaged, the fishermen automatically organized more than 30 women to dry them in the sun, and sent representatives to contact the Zhangshu Insurance Company (the ship was insured with the Zhangshu Insurance Company) and handed over all the rice to the insurance company. The patriotic actions of the fishermen are commendable.

    A Word From a Uygur Farmer
    A letter from Jin Tan of the Propaganda Department of the Yanqi Prefectural Committee of the CCP in Xinjiang: Last winter, I worked at the cooperative in Luntai County. One day, after a heavy snow, I went to the water mill to see the situation of the cotton gin. On the way, I met a Uygur fellow villager, about 30 years old, driving a large three-horse-drawn carriage, so I hitched a ride. I talked to him and learned that his name was Toha. He told me that his hometown was a key pilot area for land reform and that land reform had been completed. This cart was just distributed from the landlord; in addition, he was allocated 30 mu of paddy fields, two chopping knives, and a house.
    The car moved forward on the snowy road. Toha looked at his strong horse and happily said, "Before liberation, I never dreamed of having such a big cart and horse! At that time, I worked for the landlord for so many years, and I was tortured to death, and I couldn't even keep a thread. In those days, this horse was more valuable than me; but now, I have become its master, and this is the benefit that the Communist Party has brought me!" After speaking, he kept laughing.
    After a while, he proudly told me, "I have always been a 'yar-yuldash' (bachelor), and I recently got engaged. I am getting married tomorrow. I bought a sheep, 30 catties of rice, and 3 catties of oil, and I plan to make pilaf at the wedding. Members of the farmers' association will come to congratulate and eat pilaf. In the past, only landlords and bullies could eat pilaf, but now we laborers can eat it too."
    I asked, "Did you find your lover after liberation?" He said, "No! My lover, Roza Khan, loved me in the past, but was forcibly occupied by the landlord Usman. Later, she escaped to Kuqa, and then there was no news. After liberation, she came back and joined the farmers' association. After Usman was struggled against, he was sentenced to ten years in prison by the People's Court. We got back together and worked in a mutual aid group.... The Communist Party liberated us and fulfilled our marriage." At this time, I noticed that he was wearing a new pair of leather boots, so I smiled and said to him, "You are going to be a new son-in-law tomorrow, and you are wearing new boots today! Congratulations, you are going to have a happy family." His eyes narrowed into a line, and I saw his inner feelings from his face full of joy and hope.
    Then, Toha said with confidence: "Comrade: After liberation, life is getting better year by year, and in a few years we will live even better. Our production is also very different from the past. This year I bought a new hoe and prepared to hoe the grass in the field clean. In the past, we had not hoeed the grass for many years, and we only learned it after liberation; this has allowed us to harvest a lot more!" He took out the shiny new hoe and stroked it lovingly.
    In the intimate conversation, time passed quickly. I had arrived at my destination. After getting out of the car, I gave Toha the fare. He resolutely refused, saying:
    "The cadres of the People's Government serve the people, and they can't give money for taking a ride!" I said: "This is the regulation of the People's Government." He reluctantly accepted it; but after I walked a few steps, he called me again and said very embarrassedly: "Comrade, this is the rule of the People's Government. But no matter what, I feel uneasy taking the money."

    Acrobatic Troupes Should Seriously Pay Attention to the Safety and Health of Child Actors
    A letter from He Desheng of the Propaganda Department of the Dayu County Party Committee, Jiangxi Province: The Guangzhou Qunxiong Acrobatic Troupe came to our county to perform on the evening of March 25. While performing "Climbing the Heavenly Ladder," Luo Risuzhen, a 13-year-old actress of the troupe, accidentally fell from the "Heavenly Ladder" more than two zhang high, breaking her front jaw, shattering her teeth, and because the blood vessels in her head were ruptured, blood flowed from her ears. She was immediately taken to the county people's hospital for treatment; however, the bleeding had not stopped until 6 pm the next day, and the injured person was still not out of danger. I hope that the cultural and educational departments in various places will strengthen the leadership and education of acrobatic troupes; each acrobatic troupe must pay attention to the health and life of actors, and for acrobatic programs that are too dangerous and have no appropriate safety equipment, they should consciously retain them to avoid similar unfortunate events.
    A letter from Fang Zhen, Han Qingfu, and Jiang Jiaqing of the Party Committee of Jinxi Chemical Plant: We saw that an acrobatic troupe once performed such a program: an eight-year-old child stood on a flat board to put on pants, the board was placed on an upside-down oil bottle, and as a result, because the center of gravity was not well controlled, the child swayed back and forth on the board, and was very nervous. Later, he fell off the board. If there were no adults to hold him next to him, the child would have been hurt. This kind of performance is not a skill, but a destruction of the physical and mental health of children. This excessive tension stimulation will inevitably affect the normal development of children.
    A letter from Yan Lie of the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission: I once saw an acrobatic performance by an art troupe, in which two children, about seven or eight years old, also participated in performing programs such as climbing ladders, drilling benches, and martial arts. They kept flipping back and forth on benches and ladders, and were thrown around by adults like balls. It really makes people worry about them. I think for some programs, it is necessary to strengthen safety equipment to prevent possible dangers.
    A letter from reader Li Shikai: The Tianjin "Heping Art Troupe" recently performed acrobatics in Andong. In less than two hours of performance, a little girl under the age of ten was allowed to perform seven times in a row, and each time it was an activity that harmed the development of children's bones, brains, and other tissues, such as putting on and taking off clothes upside down (standing upside down on an object with the head, putting on and taking off clothes with both hands), and so on. Performances like this are held twice a day.
    I think it is wrong not to take care of children's development and health like this. Children in the developmental period (especially bone development) should not be allowed to do such heavy movements. Of course, the art of the motherland and people needs to be promoted and developed, and actors also need to be cultivated and educated from a young age, but doing it like the Tianjin "Heping Art Troupe" is obviously inappropriate. We can imagine that the actors cannot eat their fill before such performances, which is even more detrimental to children's development. Similar performances exist in other acrobatic troupes, and it is hoped that relevant parties will pay attention to them.

    Cadres of Jilin Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau Arbitrarily Destroy Cultural Relics
    A letter from a reader: The cadres of the Jilin Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau treated the precious cultural heritage of the motherland with a rude attitude, and destroyed the stone coffin, an important relic of the metal-stone era of two to three thousand years ago, one of the most important materials for studying the primitive culture of the Jilin area.
    Due to the lack of housing in Jilin City, the Provincial People's Government approved the Construction Engineering Bureau to temporarily borrow the exhibition room of the Jilin Provincial Museum for residence. When relocating, the comrades of the museum repeatedly explained that the museum would be responsible for moving the stone coffin three days later. However, after moving in, the Construction Engineering Bureau, just to put an extra bed, did not comply with the provisions in the guarantee letter that "all indoor equipment shall not be dismantled...or moved and damaged, etc.," and arbitrarily used shovels and other tools to destroy and discard this complete stone coffin, which was valuable for preservation and research. After the comrades of the museum discovered this, they immediately dissuaded them. At that time, there were still two coffin bottoms that had not been dismantled. However, the cadres of the Construction Engineering Bureau not only did not listen to dissuasion, but some people said: "Anyway, we moved it out!" "Do whatever you want!"
    This incident can no longer be excused with words such as "unaware of the laws on the protection of cultural relics" or "lack of common sense." Since the cultural relics preserved in the museum certainly have preservation value, the cadres of the Construction Engineering Bureau did not fulfill the regulations in the guarantee letter, nor did they listen to dissuasion, and treated other people's criticisms with such a bad attitude. This is intolerable. And the person in charge of the Construction Engineering Bureau has been notified of this matter by the museum, but has been slow to deal with it, allowing such behavior of destroying the cultural relics of the motherland to occur, which is extremely wrong.
    I request that the People's Daily publish this letter, and request that the Jilin Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau make a public reply in the newspaper.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    沈阳工业技术学校教学混乱
    沈阳市工业技术学校学生褚竹、夏安民等四十三人来信：我校的办学方针始终不明确，因此教学上非常混乱。我校在一九五一年九月成立，原名“沈阳市技术干部学校”，当时学校是专科性质，内设机械、建筑、土木三系，校方在沈阳市招收的也是高中毕业生（另附设测绘一班，为中等技术教育性质，招收初中毕业生）；但同时还有二百多学生是从沈阳市行政干部学校抽调来的，文化程度非常不齐，从高小到高中毕业的都有。这就使教学中增加很多困难，也收不到应有的教学效果。一九五二年暑期后，我校即改为中等技术学校，并改名为沈阳市工业技术学校。但奇怪的是，学校的课程仍然是从大学课程里选的，而且，教学没计划，进度也没标准。那一科有老师就开那一科，有些课程在大学里要四年级才学，我们这里第一学年第一学期就学了；有些课程上学期没有教完推到这学期，这学期教不完就再往下推。如机械原理这一学期教了二大本，很多同学都不懂。
    当学校改为中等技术学校后，校方对一九五一年招收的高中毕业的、并已在校学习了大学二年课程的一批学生，也没有根据中央关于院系调整的精神进行合理处理。
    现在我校很多同学情绪不安。有些老师和同学虽向学校领导同志提出改进学校工作的积极意见，但是也得不到支持。
    黑龙江省粮食公司不应该用官僚主义态度对待国家财产
    黑龙江省安广县粮食公司经理白玉龙来信：四月五日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者刘肃之的来信，谈到我局运粮食到德州后找不到收货者，以致被罚保管费二百八十多万元并造成粮食霉烂情况。造成错发粮食事件的原因现在正在检查中。但是黑龙江省粮食公司（以下简称省公司）用官僚主义作风对待这个事件，坐视粮食受损失，这是使人难以容忍的。
    三月初，我公司根据省公司通知，发往德州苞米三车（九十三吨）。不久后，德州车站就来电报，说是找不到收货机关。我们马上追问省公司储运科，十几天内共打了三个电话，接电话的同志每次总是含含糊糊地说大概这样，也许那样，再联系一下，过两天答复……但结果总是没下文。我们再打电报去催问，结果还是没答复。
    后来，德州粮食局也来电报追问了。我们又两次用电话问省粮食厅秘书科，结果还是没有把解决办法告诉我们。我公司为了解决这个问题，已由第二经理张果毅和东北区粮食局运输科联系后到德州去，现在还没回来。黑龙江省粮食公司这种不负责任的态度造成了人力和物力的浪费，他们应该对此进行深刻检查。
    江西清江渔民抢救国家财产
    中共江西清江县委宣传部黄学新、黄磊来信：三月二十二日，赣江中从吉安驶来一艘大众号轮船，拖着五只大民船，满装着大米，船到我县樟树大铁桥下时，因江水暴涨、风浪太大，其中一只民船被旧铁桥桩撞翻，所装六百多包大米全部翻入江中。我县沿江的樟树、桑林、邹村的渔民们为了抢救国家财产，在三月二十五日自动组织了八十二只渔划、一百六十多个劳动力，用四齿小铁锚钩挂打捞办法，在大雨巨浪中打捞了两天。结果捞起了大米四百包。这些大米捞起后，渔民们又自动组织了三十多个妇女把它晒干，并派代表向樟树保险公司接洽（该船在樟树保险公司保了险），把大米全部交给保险公司。渔民们这种爱国主义行动是值得表扬的。一个维吾尔族农民的话中共新疆焉耆地委宣传部金潭来信：去年冬天，我在轮台县合作社工作。在大雪刚停的一天，我到水磨上去看压棉机的情形。途中我遇到一个年约三十岁的维吾尔族老乡，赶着一辆三大套的大车，就顺便搭了他的车。我和他交谈起来，知道他名叫托合的。他告诉我：他们家乡是土地改革重点试验区，已经完成了土地改革。这车是刚分的地主的；此外还分到三十亩水田、两把砍头曼和一间房子。
    车在积雪的道上前进，托合的看着他的壮马，高兴地说：“解放前我做梦也想不到会有这样的大车大马啊！那时我给地主扛了多少年长活，折磨得要死，连一条线也留不下。在那年月，这匹马都比我值钱；可是如今，我已经成了它的主人了，这是共产党给我带来的好处啊！”说完，他就笑个不止。
    待了一会儿，他又得意地告诉我：“我过去一直是“呀儿果斯”（单身汉），最近订了婚，明天就要结婚。我买了一只羊、三十斤大米和三斤油，准备在婚礼时做抓饭。农会的会员都要来贺喜吃抓饭。过去只有地主恶霸才能吃抓饭，现在我们下力人也吃上了。” 
    我问：“是解放后找的爱人吧？”他说：“不！我的爱人肉孜汗在过去本来就和我相爱，但是却被地主乌斯曼强占了。以后，她逃到库车去，结果就没信了。解放后，她回来了，参加了农会。乌斯曼被斗争后，由人民法庭判处十年徒刑。我们俩又到了一起，在一个互助组工作……。共产党解放了我们，成全了我们的婚事。”这时，我才注意到他穿着一双新皮靴，就笑着对他说：“明天要当新女婿，今天新靴子就穿上了！真该祝贺你，要有一个快乐的家庭了。”他眼睛笑成了一条线，从他充满喜悦和希望的面庞上，我看到了他内心的感情。
    接着，托合的充满信心地说：“同志：解放后，日子一年比一年好，再过几年我们过得更好了。我们的生产也和过去大不同了，今年我买了一个新锄，准备把地里的草锄得干干净净。过去我们多少年来就没锄过草，解放后我们才学会了；这使我们多收了不少东西啊！”他拿出亮晶晶的新锄，心爱地抚摸着。
    在知心的谈话中，时间过得很快。我已到了目的地。下车后，我给托合的车费。他坚决不要，说：
    “人民政府的干部为人民办事，顺便搭趟车还能给钱！”我说：“这是人民政府的规定。”他勉强地接下了；但当我走了几步后，他又叫我，很不好意思地说：“同志，这是人民政府的规矩。但无论如何，我收钱太不安了。”
    杂技团应该切实注意儿童演员的安全和健康
    中共江西省大庾县委宣传部何德盛来信：广州市群雄杂技团于三月二十五日晚来我县演出。在表演“爬天梯”时，该团十三岁女演员罗日素一时不慎，从两丈多高的“天梯”上跌下，跌破了前颚，摔碎了牙齿，而且因为震破了头部血管，血从耳朵里流了出来。当时曾立即抬往县人民医院进行救治；但直到次日晚六时血仍未止住，受伤者仍未脱离危险期。我希望各地文教部门加强对杂技团的领导和教育；各杂技团更必须重视演员的健康和生命，对于过于惊险而又无适当安全设备的杂技节目，应自觉地予以保留，以免发生类似的不幸事件。
    中共锦西化工厂党委会方桢、韩庆福、江家庆来信：我们看见某杂技团曾经表演这样一个节目：一个八岁的小孩站在一块平板上穿裤子，木板是放在一个倒放的油瓶上的，结果因为重心未掌握好，孩子在板上幌来幌去，神经十分紧张，后来竟从板上倒下来了，假若旁边没有大人扶住，孩子一定会摔坏。像这种表演，已经不是技艺，而是对儿童身心健康的摧残，这种过度紧张的刺激，必然会影响儿童的正常发育的。
    军委总后勤部鄢烈来信：我曾看过一个文工团的杂技表演，其中有两个约七、八岁的孩子也参加表演爬梯子、钻板凳、大武术等节目。他们不住地在板凳、梯子上翻来倒去，被大人像球一样抛来抛去，看来，真令人为他们耽心。我认为对于有些节目，一定要加强安全设备，防止可能发生的危险。
    读者李世凯来信：天津“和平艺术剧团”最近在安东公演杂技。在不到两个小时的演出中，让一个不满十周岁的小女孩，连续出演七次，而且每次都是有损儿童骨骼、大脑等各部组织发育的活动，如倒立穿衣脱衣（用头倒立于一物上，两手穿衣脱衣）等。像这样的演出，一天两场。
    我认为这样不照顾儿童发育与健康是不应该的。儿童在发育时期（尤其骨骼发育），是不应该让他作这样过重的动作的。当然，祖国人民的艺术需要发扬光大，演员也需要从幼小时进行培养教育，但是像天津“和平艺术剧团”那样作，显然是不合适的。我们可以想像在作那样的演出的时候，演员事先是不能吃饱饭的，这就对儿童的发育更不利。类似这种表演，其他杂技团，也存在着，希望有关方面加以注意。
    吉林省建设工程局干部任意破坏文物
    一读者来信：吉林省建设工程局的干部以粗暴态度对待祖国宝贵的文化遗产，将对研究吉林地区原始文化最重要的资料之一，二三千年以前金石并用时代的重要遗物—石棺，给破坏了。
    吉林市房屋缺乏，省人民政府批准建设工程局暂借吉林省博物馆陈列室居住。迁移时博物馆的同志曾再三说明这具石棺三日后将由博物馆负责搬走。但建设工程局搬入后，仅为了多放一张床铺，不遵守保证书上所订的“室内一切设备不得拆除……及移动毁坏等”的规定，擅自用铁锹等工具将这一具富有保存和研究价值的完整石棺毁坏抛弃。博物馆的同志发现后即加以劝阻，当时尚有两块棺底未拆除。但建设工程局的干部非但不听劝阻，反而有人说：“反正我们把它搬出来啦！”“爱怎么办就怎么办吧！”
    这事件，已经不能用“不明保护文物法令”，或“毫无常识”这种字句来加以宽恕。既然保存在博物馆内的文物，当然具有保存的价值，建设工程局的干部既不履行保证书上的规定，又不听人劝阻，而以这种恶劣的态度对待别人的批评，这是难以容忍的。而建设工程局的负责人虽经博物馆的通知已知晓此事，但迟迟不予处理，听任这种破坏祖国文物的行为发生，这是极不应该的。
    我要求人民日报刊登此信，并要求吉林省建设工程局在报纸上作公开的答复。
