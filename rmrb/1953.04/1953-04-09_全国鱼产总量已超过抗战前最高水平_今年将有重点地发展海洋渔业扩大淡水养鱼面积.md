The total fish production in the country has greatly recovered and developed in the past three years, and the output has increased year by year. In 1952, the total output of marine fish production and freshwater aquaculture exceeded the highest pre-war production level by 17.2%, an increase of 290.62% compared to 1949. The production quantity this year is expected to continue to increase by 10% on this basis. In 1952, the Party and government leading organs in various places strengthened their leadership over the production during the fishing season. For example, Gaiping in Liaodong Province, Wendeng and Laiyang Prefectures and Yantai City in Shandong Province, and Taizhou and Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province, all organized unified leading bodies such as the Seashore Committee, the Fishing Port Committee, and the Production Command during the fishing season. Before going to sea, fishermen were organized to make preparations, and some even organized into teams to go to sea and return to port collectively. Moreover, due to the attention paid to organizing the production and sales during the fishing season, Guangdong Aquatic Products achieved a bumper harvest in 1952 that had not been seen in decades, and a large amount of fish products were sold out, which greatly improved the fishermen's enthusiasm for production. The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production in 1952 also directly affected the fishermen. Many fishing ports and villages have developed mutual aid and cooperative organizations for fishery production. At present, 75,264 fishermen have been organized across the country, forming 33 fishery production cooperatives and 8,733 mutual aid teams. In 1952, various places also launched patriotic production increase competitions among fishermen. In Hebei Province, 100,000 fishermen participated in the competition; fishermen in Qikou District, Huanghua County, caught 7,053,579 catties of fish in 20 days of competition, accounting for 90% of the total fish catch in the three months before the competition. In addition, the People's Government launched fishermen to organize marine production combining labor and military affairs, and established 54 storm warning stations, especially in important fishing ports, which further stabilized the fishermen's production mood. Last year, after the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government called for the development of freshwater aquaculture, various places expanded the area of water utilization. Zhejiang, Hubei, Anhui and other provinces have also made achievements in raising fish in larger lakes.

In order to enable the development of aquatic undertakings to cooperate with the development of the national economic construction plan, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened the Third National Aquatic Products Conference at the end of January and the beginning of February this year, which determined the guiding principles and tasks for the development of aquatic products this year, requiring that the production volume this year can increase by 10% on the basis of last year. The guiding principle for the development of aquatic products this year is to increase production, reduce costs, and tap potential strength. The conference required that the following tasks must be done well in aquatic product work in various places this year: (1) In marine fishery production, all localities must firmly grasp the production during the main fishing season, organize unified leading bodies, and do a good job in production; at the same time, educate fishermen to raise their vigilance, launch mass struggles against the enemy, and protect fishing grounds, in order to steadily and purposefully develop marine fishery production. (2) Attention should be paid to the development of freshwater aquaculture. Under the principle of "combining aquaculture and fishing, and gradually developing aquaculture," widely use ditches, ponds, reservoirs, and lakes for fish farming, and expand the area of freshwater fish farming by one million mu nationwide this year. At the same time, do a good job in the production and supply of fish fry and fingerlings. All localities must gradually improve the fishing gear that hinders the reproduction and protection of aquatic resources.
    (3) It is necessary to vigorously develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement in fishery production. All laboring fishermen are the objects of development. It is required that 25% of the fishermen be organized this year, so as to pave the way for further improvement of technology and production tools and increase production. (4) Vigorously organize mass processing and marketing work. Taking mass supply and marketing cooperative organizations as the mainstay, state-owned enterprises to lead, and uniting private merchants and the general public as the principle, to do a good job in processing and marketing work. (5) In terms of controlling fish prices, we must take into account the interests of production, transportation, and sales, and control fish prices according to price policies, so as to ensure smooth sales of products. (6) In freshwater fishing areas and coastal fishing areas, actively assist civil affairs departments in establishing and adjusting fishermen's county, district, and township administrative divisions; at the same time, run technical guidance stations well as the basis for the leadership and guidance of fishery production.

    全国鱼产总量已超过抗战前最高水平
    今年将有重点地发展海洋渔业扩大淡水养鱼面积
    我国水产事业三年来已有很大的恢复和发展，产量逐年上升。一九五二年海洋鱼产和淡水养殖的生产总量已超过战前最高产量水平百分之十七点二，比一九四九年增加了百分之二百九十点六二。今年的生产数量预计在这一基础上继续增产一成。一九五二年各地党、政领导机关加强了对渔汛季节生产的领导，如辽东省的盖平，山东省的文登、莱阳专区和烟台市，浙江省的台州、舟山，在渔汛季节，都组织了海市委员会、渔港委员会、生产指挥部等统一领导机构。出海前先组织渔民做好了准备工作，有的甚至做到编队出海，集体回港。又由于注意组织了渔汛期的生产运销工作，如广东水产在一九五二年获得了数十年来未有的大丰收，大量的鱼产都推销完毕，这便大大地提高了渔民生产的积极性。一九五二年农业生产中的互助合作运动的发展，也直接地影响了渔民，不少渔港渔村都发展了渔业生产的互助合作组织。现在全国组织起来的渔民已有七万五千二百六十四人，共组织了三十三个渔业生产合作社、八千七百三十三个互助组。一九五二年各地还发动渔民开展了爱国增产竞赛。河北省即有十万渔民参加了竞赛；黄骅县歧口区的渔民，二十天的竞赛中，就捕鱼七百零五万三千五百七十九斤，占竞赛前三个月捕鱼总数的百分之九十。此外，人民政府发动渔民组织劳武相结合的海洋生产，特别是在重要渔港设立了五十四所暴风警报站，更加稳定了渔民的生产情绪。去年中央人民政府农业部号召发展淡水养殖後，各地都扩大了水面的利用面积。浙江、湖北、安徽等省在较大水面的湖泊里养鱼也已有了成绩。
    为了使水产事业的发展，能配合国家经济建设计划的发展，中央人民政府农业部在今年一月底二月初召开了第三届全国水产会议，确定了今年发展水产方针、任务，要求今年的生产量能在去年的基础上增产一成。今年发展水产的方针，是提高生产，减低成本，发掘潜在力量。会议要求在今年各地水产工作中，必须做好以下几项工作：（一）各地在海洋渔业生产中，必须紧紧抓住主要渔汛季节的生产，组织统一领导机构，搞好生产；同时教育渔民提高警惕，展开群众性的对敌斗争，保护渔场，以求稳步地有重点的发展海洋渔业生产。（二）要注意发展淡水养殖。在“养殖与捕捞相结合，逐步发展养殖”的方针下，广泛利用沟渠、池塘、水库、湖荡进行养鱼，今年全国扩大淡水养鱼面积一百万亩。同时，要做好鱼苗、鱼种的生产与供应。各地须逐步改进有碍繁殖保护水产资源的捕捞网具。
    （三）要大力发展渔业生产的互助合作运动。一切劳动渔民都是发展的对象，要求今年把百分之二十五的渔民组织起来，这样才能为进一步的改进技术和生产工具，提高产量开辟道路。（四）大力组织群众性的加工运销工作。以群众供销合作组织为主，国营企业加以领导，团结私商与一般群众为原则，来搞好加工运销工作。（五）在掌握鱼价方面，必须照顾产、运、消三方面的利益，根据价格政策来掌握鱼价，做到产品销路畅通。（六）在淡水渔区和沿海渔区，积极协助民政部门建立与调整渔民县、区、乡行政区划；同时要办好技术指导站，作为渔业生产的领导与指导的基础。
