    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd: The anti-aircraft gunners and air force fighters of the Korean People's Army have recently continued to deal heavy blows to the American aerial bandits who are carrying out indiscriminate bombing.

    On thousands of high grounds in the front and rear of Korea, the People's Army anti-aircraft gun groups have recently achieved brilliant results in anti-air combat. The Park Ro-ok anti-aircraft gun group, which protects our ground forces in a certain area of the front line, shot down a total of fourteen enemy planes in seven fierce anti-air battles recently. On the afternoon of March 19, the gunners of the Park Ro-ok anti-aircraft gun group engaged in a fierce battle with more than ten invading enemy planes. The gunners first kept a close watch on the enemy leader, who was commanding the enemy formation to circle over the highlands, in the gunsight. When the enemy leader began to strafe downwards and dive, the gunners all fired at it. The enemy leader wanted to turn around and ascend to avoid the fire net from the ground, but it was too late. Its tail was hit, and smoke and fire came out. Soon, it crashed about 500 meters away from the gunners' position. The gunners then bombarded the remaining enemy planes with fierce firepower, and shot down another enemy plane in less than three minutes. On this day of the 19th, they shot down a total of three enemy planes. The female anti-aircraft gun group of Kim Hae-jung's squadron of the People's Army also recently shot down two enemy planes.

    At the same time, the air force fighters of the People's Army are also stepping up their efforts to strike the invading aerial enemies. The air force fighters under Choi Sang-tae bravely met the invading enemy plane formation and recently shot down five enemy planes. The Yang Doo-hee formation shot down another two enemy planes in a recent air battle. Air Force fighter Kim Shi-beom of a certain formation had previously shot down two enemy "B-26" bombers. On February 15, he and his comrades-in-arms fought fiercely with sixteen "F-86" enemy planes. Under the cover of his wingman, Park Hyung-rip, he shot down an enemy wingman. Then he bravely pursued the enemy leader who had lost his wingman's cover and tried to escape alone. When he was only 600 meters away from the enemy leader, he fired two bursts of shells fiercely and shot it down to the ground.

    朝鲜人民军连续沉重打击美国空中强盗
    【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜人民军对空射击手和空军战士们，最近继续沉重地打击滥肆轰炸的美国空中强盗。
    在朝鲜前后方的千百个高地上，人民军对空射击组最近都取得了对空作战的光辉战果。在前线某地掩护我军地面部队的朴露玉对空射击组，在最近七次激烈的对空战斗中共打落敌机十四架。三月十九日下午，朴露玉对空射击组的射手们，和十多架来犯的敌机展开了激战。射手们首先在瞄准镜里紧紧盯住指挥敌机编队在高地上空盘旋的敌长机。当敌长机开始向下扫射并进行俯冲时，射手们便一齐对准它开火。敌长机正想调头上升，避开地面发射的火网，但是已经来不及了，它的尾部被打中，冒出了火烟，不一会儿，就摔落在离射手们阵地约五百公尺的地点。射手们接着又用猛烈的火力轰击其余的敌机，不到三分钟，又打落了敌机一架。他们在十九日这一天，就一共打落了敌机三架。人民军某部金海贞中队的妇女对空射击组的组员们，最近也打落了敌机两架。
    同时，人民军的空军战士们，也加紧痛击来犯的空中敌人。崔相泰所属空军战士们奋勇迎击来犯的敌机编队，最近打落了敌机五架。杨斗熙编队在最近一次空战中，又打落敌机两架。某编队空军战士金时范过去曾打落敌“Ｂ—二十六”型轰炸机两架。二月十五日，他和同队的战友们一起，和十六架“Ｆ—八十六”型的敌机猛烈交战。在朴享立僚机的掩护下，他打落了一架敌僚机。接着他又英勇地追击那架失掉僚机掩护而企图单独逃命的敌长机。在离敌长机只有六百公尺时，他狠狠地发射了两串炮弹，把它也打落在地了。
