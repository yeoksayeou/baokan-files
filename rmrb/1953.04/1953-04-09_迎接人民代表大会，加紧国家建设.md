    Welcoming the National People's Congress, Accelerating National Construction
    Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    The "Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels" has been promulgated. The National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels are about to be convened. The broad masses of workers and trade union members throughout the country wholeheartedly support this measure of the government and are greatly encouraged by it. There is no doubt that this measure will create a good beginning for the country's large-scale planned economic construction and will powerfully guarantee the successful completion of our country's construction plan.

    Chairman Mao Zedong said in "On Coalition Government": "Generally speaking, without an independent, free, democratic, and unified China, it is impossible to develop industry." Therefore, the primary goal of the Chinese people's decades of arduous struggle was to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and seize state power into their own hands. This goal has been brilliantly achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. This is a great historical victory for the Chinese people.

    Our country—the People's Republic of China—is a people's country, and our government is the most democratic and therefore the most powerful in Chinese history. In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have carried out a series of political reform movements—land reform, democratic reform of industrial and mining enterprises, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the reform of the marriage system, and the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals, and so on. Through this series of movements, the shackles that had always been placed on the heads of the masses of the people were destroyed, and the reactionary remnants in various aspects and the bad habits and bad ideas left over from the old society were eliminated or greatly reduced. The masses of the people have liberated themselves from the rule of reactionary forces and have made themselves an organized force. For the masses of the people, this is the broadest and most vivid democracy. Of course, for the landlord class, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and the Kuomintang reactionaries who represent these classes, this is also dictatorship. Precisely because the people have true democracy, the people's dictatorship is powerful.

    Political reform is to liberate the productive forces and for the construction of the new China. Indeed, with the completion of a series of democratic reform movements, our economy has also been restored and developed, which has leveled the foundation and prepared the conditions for our country's large-scale planned construction undertakings. It is on this basis that we have been able to enter a new historical period—the period of national construction. The convening of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels is the result of the Chinese people's struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party for the past three years, and it is also the beginning of a new construction period. Chairman Mao Zedong said in "On Coalition Government": "After the political conditions of New Democracy are obtained, the Chinese people and their government must take practical steps to gradually establish heavy and light industries within a few years, and turn China from an agricultural country into an industrial country. A New Democratic country cannot be consolidated without a solid economic foundation, without a progressive agriculture that is more developed than it is at present, without a large-scale industry that occupies a very large proportion of the national economy, and without corresponding transportation, trade, finance, and other undertakings." Political democracy and economic construction are mutually conditional and interconnected. The victory of the construction undertaking will further consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate the "independence, freedom, democracy, and unity of New Democracy," and open the road to socialism.

    In the People's China, the people of all strata have obtained full democracy. The convening of the National People's Congress does not mean that we had no democracy in the past, but to consolidate the democratic life we have already obtained from the organizational and institutional aspects and give it full play. Therefore, the convening of the National People's Congress marks the further consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, marks that all our work has begun to turn to the normal track, marks that the era of reform movements has basically passed, and the people of the whole country will concentrate all their energy on construction, strengthen our economic and defense forces, and build our own beautiful life.

    Our country is led by the working class, so the internal democracy of the working class's political party—the Communist Party—and the extent of its connection with the masses of the people are of decisive significance to the democratic life of the masses of the people. Of course, we all know that the Communist Party has always emphasized criticism and self-criticism, emphasized contact with the masses, and has more than once seriously rectified itself to oppose bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. From the perspective of the working class's mass organization—the trade union—the trade union's own democratic life also has a major impact on the national democratic system. An undemocratic trade union can never become a strong social pillar of a democratic government. Our democratic life is organized and is fully guaranteed through the people's own organization. If the trade union itself lacks democratic life, it cannot guide the broad masses of workers to participate in the election with the attitude of masters, elect the candidates supported by the broad masses of workers to the government, and accurately reflect the opinions and demands of the broad masses of workers to governments at all levels through its own activities, and even more, it cannot organizationally and effectively assist and supervise government organs in implementing national laws and policies. Therefore, in order to welcome the convening of the National People's Congress, it is necessary to truly establish and improve the democratic life within the trade union, especially in the election process of the Seventh National Labor Congress (Seventh Trade Union Congress), it is even more important to focus on checking the status of our trade union's democratic life and ensuring the democratic life of the trade union from the organizational and institutional aspects.

    The "Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels" has been promulgated. It demonstrates a high degree of democratic spirit. It gives full respect to the people's right to vote and to be elected, without any unreasonable restrictions, as in capitalist countries. It fully demonstrates the spirit of unity of the united front, carefully takes care of all classes, nationalities, and aspects. At the same time, it is realistic and pragmatic, without any empty or exaggerated words, so it is completely achievable rather than formal. It clearly stipulates sanctions against those who undermine the election, thus providing a practical guarantee for the people's democratic rights. Trade union members and workers, comrades, should study this election law and cherish their right to vote and to be elected, and actively participate in the election in accordance with the provisions of the election law.

    Our great motherland has embarked on a new historical period, and an even brighter future is already in sight. Let us make a hundredfold effort, accelerate national construction, strengthen the resistance against America and aid to Korea, protect the victories we have already achieved, and strive for greater new victories.

    迎接人民代表大会，加紧国家建设
    中华全国总工会秘书长  赖若愚
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及各级地方人民代表大会选举法已经公布，全国及各级地方人民代表大会即将召开，全国职工群众和工会会员，竭诚拥护政府的这一措施，并由此得到极大的鼓舞。毫无疑义，这一措施，必将给国家大规模有计划的经济建设造成良好的开端，并将有力地保证我国建设计划的胜利完成。
    毛泽东主席在“论联合政府”中说：“就整个来说，没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业。”所以，中国人民数十年来艰苦斗争的第一个目的，便是推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，把国家政权夺取到自己手上来。这一个目的，在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导之下已经光辉地达到了，这是中国人民伟大的历史性的胜利。
    我们的国家——中华人民共和国是人民的国家，我们的政府是中国历史上最民主的，因而也是最强有力的。开国三年来，全国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，进行了一系列的政治改革运动——土地改革、工矿企业的民主改革、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”运动、婚姻制度的改革以及知识分子的思想改造运动等等。经过这一系列的运动，摧毁了从来套在人民群众头上的枷锁，扫除了或大大地扫除了各个方面的反动残余和旧社会遗留下来的坏习惯、坏思想。人民群众从反动势力的统治之下解放了自己，并且使自己成为有组织的力量。对于人民群众来说，这就是最广泛最生动的民主。当然，对于地主阶级、官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派来说，这也就是专政。正因为人民有了真正的民主，所以人民的专政才是强有力的。
    政治改革，是为了解放生产力，是为了新中国的建设。的确，随着一系列的民主改革运动的完成，我们的经济也得到了恢复与发展，这就为我们国家大规模有计划的建设事业铲平了地基，准备了条件。正是在这样的基础上，使我们有可能进入一个新的历史时期——国家的建设时期。全国人民代表大会和各级地方人民代表大会的召开，是三年来中国人民在毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导之下斗争的成果，也是新的建设时期的开端。毛泽东主席在“论联合政府”中说：“在新民主主义的政治条件获得之后，中国人民及其政府必须采取切实的步骤，在若干年内逐步地建立重工业和轻工业，使中国由农业国变为工业国。新民主主义的国家，如无巩固的经济做它的基础，如无进步的比较现时发达得多的农业，如无大规模的在全国经济比重上占极大优势的工业以及与此相适应的交通、贸易、金融等事业做它的基础，是不能巩固的。”政治民主和经济建设是互为条件、互相关联的。建设事业的胜利，将更进一步地巩固我们的人民民主专政，巩固“新民主主义的独立、自由、民主、统一”，并打开走向社会主义的道路。
    在人民的中国，各阶层人民群众已经获得了充分的民主。人民代表大会的召开，并不是意味着我们过去没有民主，而是要把我们已经获得的民主生活从组织上、制度上巩固起来，加以充分的发扬。所以人民代表大会的召开，标志着人民民主专政的更加巩固，标志着我们的一切工作开始转向正常的轨道，标志着改革运动的时代已经基本上过去了，全国人民将把全部精力集中到建设方面来，加强我们的经济力量和国防力量，建设自己的美好生活。
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的，所以工人阶级的政党——共产党的党内民主和它与人民群众联系的程度，对于人民群众的民主生活是有决定意义的。当然，我们大家都知道，共产党是从来强调批评与自我批评，强调与群众的联系的，并且不只一次地认真地整顿自己，反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象。从工人阶级的群众组织——工会来说，工会本身的民主生活，对于国家民主制度也是有重大影响的。不民主的工会绝不能成为民主政府的强有力的社会支柱。我们的民主生活是有组织的，是通过人民自己的组织而得到充分保障的。如果工会本身缺乏民主生活，它就不能引导职工群众以主人翁的态度参加选举，把职工群众所拥护的人选到政府中去，并经过工会自己的活动，确切地把职工群众的意见与要求反映到各级政府中去，更不能有组织地、有效地协助和监督政府机关贯彻国家的法令政策。所以为了迎接人民代表大会的召开，必须确实建立和健全工会内部的民主生活，特别是在第七次全国劳动大会（第七次工会代表大会）的选举过程中，更要着重地检查我们工会的民主生活状况，并从组织上制度上保障工会的民主生活。
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及各级地方人民代表大会选举法已经公布了，它表现了高度的民主精神，它对于人民的选举权与被选举权予以充分的尊重，没有丝毫不合理的限制，如像资本主义国家那样。它充分地表现了统一战线的团结的精神，周到地照顾了各阶级、各民族和各方面。同时，它又是实事求是的，没有丝毫浮词夸语，因而它是完全可以实现的，而不是形式的。它明白规定了对破坏选举的制裁，因而它使人民的民主权利有了切实的保障。工会会员和职工同志们，应该学习这个选举法，并且要十分珍贵自己的选举权和被选举权，根据选举法的规定，积极地参加选举。
    我们伟大的祖国已经开始走上了一个新的历史时期，更美好的前途已经可以看得见了。让我们百倍地努力，加紧国家建设，加强抗美援朝，保护我们已经取得的胜利，争取更大的新的胜利。
