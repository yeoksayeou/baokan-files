    美机继续滥炸朝鲜和平城乡
    【新华社平壤八日电】正当全世界爱好和平的人民热烈支持我国周恩来总理、朝鲜金日成首相和苏联莫洛托夫外长关于朝鲜问题的声明，渴望实现朝鲜和平的时候，美国侵略军的军用飞机仍然继续对朝鲜和平城乡进行狂轰滥炸，屠杀和平居民。
    四月四日晚十时，美国侵略空军出动“B—二十九”型轰炸机编队，对平壤市北区、西区及东北地区进行了有计划的野蛮轰炸。敌机共投下各种炸弹数百颗，炸死了许多老弱妇孺。例如，住在平壤市北区的一个小贩金德淳的全家八口人，他自己、年老的母亲、妻子以及从两岁到十六岁的五个子女，全都被美国空中强盗炸死了。附近地区还有很多妇女和儿童被炸死。四月六日夜里，敌机对平壤附近地区又整夜进行疯狂的袭扰。
    五日夜里，美机曾对黄海道凤山郡一带的农村进行滥炸，共投下炸弹八百多颗，破坏了许多民房，屠杀了许多农民和儿童。
    在这以前，在四月一日、二日，敌机对平安南道温泉郡、咸镜南道新浦郡、黄海道凤山郡等地的和平城乡，都进行了野蛮的轰炸和扫射。
