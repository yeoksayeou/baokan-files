Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations has been supported and welcomed by broad social strata and many newspapers in countries around the world.

    German Democratic Republic
    The "Neues Deutschland" of the German Democratic Republic wrote: Zhou Enlai's proposal once again proves that the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea both desire peace and that both governments are considering an early end to the Korean War. The people of the whole world accept this proposal with satisfaction. This proposal is fully in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the world, because the end of the bloody Korean War and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question are directly related to the peace and security of the people of the Far East and the world. The people of all countries have long demanded an end to the Korean War and have been very indignant at the previous US interruption of the armistice negotiations. They will now closely watch the reaction of the United States and its partners to Zhou Enlai's new peace initiative.
    Poland
    The Polish "People's Tribune" published a commentary entitled "An Important Step for Peace," saying: The whole world accepts Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations with admiration. The new proposal put forward by the Chinese and Korean governments opens a path that can eliminate existing disputes and end the Korean War. The proposals in Zhou Enlai's statement demonstrate China and People's Korea's firm policy of peace. These proposals are fully in line with the wishes of the people of all countries, including the American people, because they all demand an end to the bloodshed in Korea and a relaxation of the situation in the Far East.
    "Daily News" published an article by Stefan Leader, which said: Zhou Enlai's proposal is fair and reasonable. If the United States has even the slightest intention of seeking an armistice in Korea and a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, it should agree to abide by the principles of the Geneva Conventions and, based on Zhou Enlai's practical and feasible suggestions for the benefit of world peace, repatriate prisoners of war.
    "Warsaw Life" wrote: The vast people of the world are very satisfied to hear the news of the new peace proposal from the Chinese and Korean sides. The Korean War seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world. The people of all countries, including the American people, demand an end to the slaughter in Korea and an end to the war that has strained the entire international situation, especially threatening the security of the Far East. Now, the new proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides have opened up a path to achieving peace in Korea and easing international tensions. The vast majority of the world's people resolutely demand that concrete and constructive proposals on this issue be accepted by all countries. This is also the sincere wish of all the people of Poland.
    Czechoslovakia
    The Czechoslovak "Red Rights" published a commentary on April 2nd on Premier Zhou's statement, saying: This step taken by the Chinese and Korean People's Governments is welcomed with unparalleled enthusiasm by ordinary people all over the world. The governments of China and Korea insist that all prisoners of war should be repatriated, but in order to quickly stop the bloody war in Korea by peaceful means, they have put forward a fair solution so that the issue of prisoners of war does not become an obstacle to the armistice. The entire people of Czechoslovakia, along with all peace-loving people in the world, warmly welcome the efforts made by the governments of China and Korea to seek an armistice in Korea.
    India
    Indian public opinion welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations. "The Statesman" published an editorial on the 2nd, saying that Zhou Enlai's statement was encouraging and sincere in tone. "The Times of India" believes that Zhou Enlai's proposal "will clear the way for new efforts to achieve peace." "Free Press" pointed out that Zhou Enlai's statement has aroused great enthusiasm throughout the world.
    In commenting on Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, "The Bombay Chronicle" pointed out that in fact, the US position on the issue of prisoners of war is untenable because prisoners of war in the hands of the enemy cannot freely express their opinions. The newspaper called for not missing this good opportunity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
    Britain
    British newspapers all published Premier Zhou Enlai's statement and published comments expressing welcome. "News Chronicle" said: "Hope for an early end to this thirty-three-month-long war has increased because Zhou Enlai has put forward new proposals to break the deadlock on the prisoner of war issue and remove the final obstacle to the armistice." The newspaper added: Now, we should not only strive to ease today's tensions, but also strive to achieve a solution that can ensure that we and our children will not be disappointed in the future. The conservative "Daily Express" editorial said: "Zhou Enlai's proposal on the Korean prisoner of war issue is like a rainbow appearing in the eastern sky." "The Scotsman" editorial said: "It seems that this move by China has removed the obstacles to reaching a ceasefire." "News Chronicle" wrote in an editorial on Zhou Enlai's statement: Because of the breaking of this deadlock, individual difficulties are insignificant. "Daily Express" wrote: Now, do not let suspicion prevail, it should be expressed: "Western countries expect peace." On March 31, a representative of the British Foreign Office declared: Britain is consulting with Commonwealth countries, the United States, France, and other relevant countries on the proposal of the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China to resolve the Korean conflict. The Foreign Office representative said that the proposal made by Zhou Enlai on March 30 "needs to be carefully studied, but at first glance, it seems promising." British Labor MP Swinnerton said that this was good news and he hoped that the senior authorities would discuss this proposal immediately in order to end the Korean slaughter. Another Labor MP Griffiths said: "The British government should use all its influence to ensure that Britain's allies seriously consider accepting this proposal."
    The British "Workers' Daily" reported on the 2nd that since the publication of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations, a large number of letters and resolutions have been sent from all over Britain, demanding that the British government accept the peace proposals of China and Korea, including a letter written by two hundred workers from the John Brown Shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, a letter written by one hundred workers from London Airport, and a letter written by eighty-four workers from the Acton Nabeiai Factory. The Rosehahn Labor Party organization passed an emergency resolution requesting the Labor Party's National Executive Committee to urge the government to immediately accept this proposal. Workshop representatives from the Electrical Workers' Union and the Civil Aviation Transport Industry requested Churchill to accept the proposals from China and Korea. A survey conducted by the London East Ham Peace Movement organization showed that 96% of those questioned were in favor of an immediate ceasefire in Korea.
    France
    In France, Parisian newspapers all published Zhou Enlai's statement on the exchange of prisoners of war and the signing of an armistice agreement in Korea in prominent positions on March 31. "L'Humanité" described in detail the statement broadcast by Beijing. "Combat" called Zhou Enlai's statement an "extremely important statement" because "it makes the settlement of the Korean conflict hopeful." "Le Figaro" pointed out that Zhou Enlai's proposal was of great significance, and the newspaper believed that this event should be treated with great caution. "Volontaire" also stated: Beijing has shown a desire for peace, which is believed to be real and sincere. "Libération" commented that Zhou Enlai's statement "brings a real factor to ease international tensions, because he put forward humane and reasonable methods for resolving the prisoner of war issue - resolving the last obstacle to creating an armistice in Korea." The bourgeois newspaper "Le Figaro" said:
    "This is an event of great significance." "Le Parisien Libéré" considers this to be a "remarkable proposal," and "Combat" also considers this to be a "positive proposal."

    世界各国拥护和欢迎周总理声明
    据新华社讯：我中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理兼外长关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明，受到世界各国广大社会阶层和许多报纸的拥护和欢迎。
    德意志民主共和国
    德意志民主共和国的“新德意志报”写道：周恩来的建议又一次证明中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府都希望和平，证明两国政府都考虑着尽速结束朝鲜战争。全世界人民都以满意的心情接受这个建议。这个建议完全符合全世界人民的根本利益，因为血腥的朝鲜战争的结束和朝鲜问题的和平解决，是直接关系到远东和世界各国人民的和平及安全的。世界各国人民很久以来就要求停止朝鲜战争，对美国以前中断停战谈判感到非常愤慨，他们现在将密切注视美国和它的伙伴对于周恩来的新的和平步骤的反应。
    波兰
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表题为“为了和平的重要步骤”的评论说：全世界都以感佩的心情接受周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明。周恩来提出的中朝两国政府的新建议，打开了一条可以消除现存的争执并结束朝鲜战争的道路。周恩来声明中的建议，表现了中国和人民朝鲜的坚定的和平政策，这些建议完全符合包括美国人民在内的各国人民的愿望，因为他们都要求终止朝鲜的流血，缓和远东局势。
    “每日新闻”刊载了斯达芬·李道尔写的一篇文章，文章说：周恩来的建议是公正而合理的。如果美国方面还有一点点意思希望在朝鲜停战并使朝鲜问题获得和平解决的话，它就应该同意遵照日内瓦公约的原则，并根据周恩来在这个问题上为了世界和平的利益而提出的切实可行的建议，来遣返战俘。
    “华沙生活”写道：全世界广大人民听到中朝方面的新的和平建议的消息后，都感到非常满意。朝鲜战争严重地威胁了远东和全世界的和平。一切国家的人民，包括美国人民在内，都要求停止朝鲜的屠杀，结束这场使整个国际局势紧张，特别是使远东安全受到威胁的战争。现在，中朝方面的新建议已经打开了在朝鲜实现和平、缓和国际紧张局势的通路。全世界绝大多数的人都坚决要求关于这个问题的具体的和建设性的建议能为所有国家接受。这也是波兰全体人民的衷心愿望。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”四月二日就周总理声明发表评论说：中国和朝鲜两国人民政府采取的这个步骤，受到全世界普通人民的无比热烈的欢迎。中朝两国政府坚持应该遣返全部战俘的主张，但是为了用和平方法迅速停止朝鲜的流血战争，提出了公正的解决方法，以使得战俘问题不致成为停战的障碍。捷克斯洛伐克全体人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，热烈欢迎中朝两国政府为谋求朝鲜停战而作的努力。
    印度
    印度舆论对周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明表示欢迎。“政治家报”在二日发表社论说，周恩来的声明令人鼓舞，语气诚恳。“印度时报”认为：周恩来的建议“将为争取和平的新努力扫清道路”。“自由新闻”指出，周恩来的声明已经在全世界引起了巨大的热情。
    “孟买纪事报”在评论周恩来总理的声明时指出，事实上美方在战俘问题上的立场是站不住脚的，因为在敌人手中的战俘不可能自由发表意见。该报要求不要错过这一个和平解决朝鲜问题的好机会。
    英国
    英国各报都登载了周恩来总理的声明，并纷纷发表评论表示欢迎。“新闻纪事报”说：“由于周恩来提出了打破战俘问题僵局以除去停战最后障碍的新建议，早日结束这个历时三十三个月之久的战争的希望增加了。”该报又说：现在不仅应该努力缓和今日的紧张局势，而且应该努力获致解决，这种解决可以保证我们和我们的孩子将来不会失望。保守的“每日快报”的社论说：“周恩来提出了关于朝鲜战俘问题的建议，正像东方的天空里出现了彩虹一样。”“苏格兰人报”的社论说：“看来中国的这个举动已消除了达成停火的障碍。”“新闻纪事报”社论就周恩来的声明写道：由于这个僵局的打破，个别困难也就不足道了。“每日快报”写道：现在，不要让怀疑占上风，应当表示：“西方国家期望和平。”三月三十一日，英国外交部代表宣称：英国正和联邦国家、美国、法国和其他有关国家就中华人民共和国外交部长关于解决朝鲜冲突的建议进行商讨。外交部代表说，三月三十日周恩来提出的建议“需要仔细地研究，但是骤然看来，似乎是有希望的”。英国工党议员斯文勒说，这是一个好消息，他希望高级当局立刻讨论这个建议，以便终止朝鲜屠杀。另一工党议员格里菲思说：“英国政府应当运用它所有的影响使英国的盟国认真地来考虑接受这个建议。”
    英国“工人日报”二日报道，自从中国周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明发表以后，从英国各地立刻寄来大量的信件和决议，要求英国政府接受中朝两国的和平建议，其中有苏格兰克莱德班克的约翰·布朗造船厂两百个工人所写的信，伦敦机场一百个工人所写的信，阿克顿那彼挨工厂八十四个工人所写的信。罗塞翰的工党组织通过紧急决议，要求工党全国执行委员会促使政府立刻接受这个建议。电气工会和民用航空运输工业中的车间代表要求邱吉尔接受中朝方面的建议。伦敦东哈姆和平运动组织所进行的调查结果表明，被询问的人中间有百分之九十六是赞成朝鲜立刻停火的。

    “这是一个有重大意义的事件。”“解放了的巴黎人报”认为这是一个“可观的提议”，“战斗报”也认为这是“积极的建议”。
