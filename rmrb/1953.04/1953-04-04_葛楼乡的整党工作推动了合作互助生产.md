The Gelou Township in the First District of Puyang County, Shandong Province, includes five natural villages: Xuzhuang, Wenzhuang, Sihe Village, Gelou, and Xiao Cao Xing, with a total of 791 households and 3,799 people. The Party branches in these five villages were all established between 1933 and 1937, and currently have 199 Party members. In the various periods before the land reform, the Party branch of this township did a lot of work for the Party and the people, and many tested model Party members emerged, who were repeatedly praised by the higher-level Party organizations. However, after the land reform, due to a lack of education, the "revolutionary success" and "complacency of heroes" mentality emerged among the Party members of the branch, as well as passivity and slackness in their work. The vast majority of Party members did not lead or participate in cooperative and mutual aid organizations. Some Party members developed capitalist exploitation thoughts and behaviors. Currently, one person hires long-term laborers, ten people lend money at usurious rates, and many people plan to hire long-term laborers. In addition, coercive and commanding work styles also exist among Party member cadres in Wenzhuang and Xiao Cao Xing. They often use methods such as "drawing sticks," "drawing lots," and "apportioning" to complete tasks. As for the phenomena of "taking advantage," "turning public property into small public property," and extravagance and waste, these are also very common among Party member cadres.

    **Using Typical Examples to Educate on Production Direction and Working Style**

    In response to the above situation, this township paid special attention to education on the direction of cooperation and collectivization in production and the mass line in working style during this Party rectification education. Before the education, various good and bad typical examples were collected through investigation and research. A lively and realistic educational method was adopted, with very good results.

    When conducting communist future education, the collective farms of the Soviet Union were introduced through the reports of visiting delegations to the Soviet Union and the screening of slides, so that Party members could recognize the superiority of large-scale production and the prospects of communist society. Combined with China's actual situation, it was explained how China would move towards communism, and the direction of cooperation and collectivization in production was explained. When criticizing the capitalist road, the following typical examples were used:

    (1) By means of the self-criticisms of typical figures with rich peasant thoughts such as Xu Hongpao and Dong Zhenshan, promote Party members' criticism of rich peasant exploitation thoughts and behaviors. At the beginning, Xu Hongpao's self-criticism at the meeting was not profound. Therefore, during the discussion, Party members struggled against Xu Hongpao, and those who had prejudices against him took the opportunity to retaliate, saying that Xu Hongpao was "Little Chiang Kai-shek." At that time, Xu Hongpao's thinking was under great pressure. At this time, the working group summarized the lessons learned from this failed use of typical examples, and realized that: (1) The selection of typical examples should be appropriate and must be educated to maturity in advance; (2) The criticism of typical wrong ideas should be combined with each Party member's self-criticism. Criticizing typical examples in isolation is ineffective; (3) Criticizing bad typical examples should be combined with establishing good typical examples in order to have a positive educational significance. In order to reverse the bad influence, at the second meeting, the historical achievements of Xu Hongpao were first introduced, and the root causes and harms of the development of his wrong ideas after the land reform were accurately pointed out. Xu Hongpao also admitted his mistakes to everyone and expressed his willingness to give up exploitation and participate in mutual aid teams. Everyone was very satisfied. The second person to make a self-criticism was Dong Zhenshan, who said: "In the past, I worked for landlords, and suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression. After the land reform, I turned over and forgot the pain of the scars. I repeatedly fraudulently obtained loans, built tile houses, bought land, added livestock, and planned to hire workers next year. I turned around and wanted to exploit others again. If I didn't rectify the Party, I would become a rich peasant in a few years. If everyone had the same idea as me, could we still move towards communism?" That night, the working group led everyone to examine themselves in light of Xu Hongpao and Dong Zhenshan's thoughts. During the discussion, ten people who lent money at usurious rates, one who engaged in speculative trading, and those who planned to buy land and develop into rich peasants all made self-criticisms.

    (2) Through the typical report of the Wang Anzhong Cooperative in a neighboring township and the comparison of production volume of individual households, Party members recognized the direction of cooperative and mutual aid production. Before Wang Piyi, the accountant of the Wang Anzhong Cooperative, made his report, the working group collected Party members' questions. At the meeting, Wang Piyi first introduced the process of establishment, development, and consolidation of the cooperative, and then compared the land yields of the two years before and after cooperation through detailed accounting. He said: "Our cooperative has 182 mu of land for eight members. The total output in 1951 before cooperation was 35,000 jin, and the total output in 1952 after cooperation was 60,000 jin." Finally, he announced the 1953 plan, guaranteeing an increase in production to 135,800 jin. After deducting the annual expenses of 89 people in eight households, there would be a surplus of 80,200 jin, which would be used to purchase new agricultural tools, increase fertilizers, build new houses, and improve living standards. On the spot, Party members raised many questions, such as "How was the bank loan owed at the time of establishment repaid?" "What guarantees are there for completing the 1953 production increase plan?" "How are work points recorded and dividends distributed?" "Are members free to go to market, visit relatives, and do some household chores?" "What about the children when women participate in work?" Wang Piyi gave satisfactory answers to each question. Then the working group gave four examples to compare the average yield per mu of land in 1952 for cooperation and mutual aid and individual households: Chen Xincong Cooperative in Wulipu was 487 jin, Chen Bailong's year-round mutual aid team in Houbaizhuang was 287 jin, Bai Wanfang's temporary mutual aid team was 160 jin, while the individual household Zhang Liangrang, known as the "agricultural talent," only harvested 140 jin of grain. After the comparative education of these typical examples, Party members said, "If we take Wang Anzhong's road, production can be developed in two or three years; if we take Xu Hongpao's road, we will never reach communism in our lifetime." Party members in Xuzhuang made a self-criticism, saying, "Although our village branch had achievements in the past, in recent years, we have been complacent and have not implemented the Party's policy of cooperative mutual aid and production increase. As a result, the Wang Anzhong Cooperative produces an average of 330 jin of grain per mu, while our village only produces a little over 100 jin per mu. It seems that relying on old qualifications is not enough."

    (3) Organized a slide show to show "Introduction to Production and Life of Soviet Collective Farms," "Growth of Chen Xincong Cooperative," "Mutual Aid is Better than Individual Work," and other pictures, so that Party education and mass mobilization outside the Party were combined.

    Gelou Township effectively solved the selfish and self-interested thoughts of Party member cadres such as corruption, waste, and taking advantage of opportunities by vigorously implementing the education on the third and fifth articles of the Party member standards. When lecturing in the township, on the one hand, it clarified the correct relationship between the personal interests of Party members and the collective interests of the Party and the people, and at the same time, used Gao Deqi, a Party member from Wenzhuang who was consistently selfish and self-interested, as a typical self-criticism to promote self-examination by people with similar thoughts.

    In order to establish a model of progress within the Party, at another typical report meeting, Wang Yulan (female), a model Party member who had consistently worked actively for the Party and the people, sacrificed herself for the public, and maintained close ties with the masses in any environment for 20 years since joining the Party, was introduced, and six model Party members were selected from various villages in the discussion and commended at the meeting. Party members generally reflected: "This Party rectification is strict in reward and punishment." The Party's prestige has been greatly improved, and thirty-four members of the Communist Youth League and representatives of the masses have applied to join the Party.

    **Close Integration of Party Rectification and Current Work**

    The township paid great attention to closely integrating this Party rectification with current work. When the Party rectification work group entered the village, it first started with inspecting and arranging production and various tasks, and comprehensively studied the steps and methods for completing various tasks: For some urgent temporary tasks, such as autumn grain requisition and sweeping snow on highways, it was completed quickly during the mobilization and preparation stage. For some seasonal tasks, such as winter plowing and winter sideline production, it was completed in conjunction with the Party rectification process, with appropriate time allocation. According to needs, one or two mornings or afternoons were set aside each day for Party members to engage in agricultural and sideline production; other long-term construction tasks, such as cooperation and mutual aid, well digging, credit work, and democratic political construction, mainly focused on improving Party members' awareness and laying a good ideological foundation through education during the Party rectification period; during the construction stage of Party rectification, the leadership made unified arrangements and systematically rectified and consolidated various organizations to do a good job in various tasks to consolidate the results of Party rectification. Secondly, in order to take care of various tasks during Party rectification, eleven Party member cadres without problems or with relatively minor problems were selected to lead winter plowing, autumn requisition, and other tasks in conjunction with non-Party cadres, and they were required to report to the branch every five days. Thirdly, the eight articles of the Party member standards were organically combined with the current practical work. For example, in the mobilization stage of Party rectification, patriotism education was carried out in conjunction with the situation explanation, further explaining the great achievements of the country's construction in the past three years and the great victory of the front and rear of the anti-US aggression and aid Korea. Combined with the examples of the township, the achievements of the township were affirmed, and the tendency of Party members to bury themselves in production and not ask about politics and the selfish and self-interested thoughts of individual Party members who "dislike the heavy public grain" were criticized to improve the patriotic awareness of Party members and the masses.

    In conducting the education on the seventh article of the Party member standards, the Party helped Party members summarize several tasks that had been done badly in the past due to coercive orders and carried out education on the mass line. For example, in May 1951, the government mobilized the masses in four districts to build the Lin Huang Dike, and Party member cadres in Xiao Cao Xing forced the masses to provide labor by means of "drawing sticks"; in 1952, cadres in Wenzhuang forced the masses to provide people and money to dig a well by means of "apportionment," which caused opposition from the masses. During the inspection and summary, the method of joint inspection from top to bottom was adopted. The leader of the working group, Ma Shiyi, represented the district in making a self-criticism of the simplification of the arrangement of work and the commanding style. The responsibilities of the upper and lower levels were clear, and the Party members were very satisfied. Therefore, in the specific discussion of the establishment of year-round mutual aid teams, some Party members said, "This time, the establishment of mutual aid teams cannot be like in 1947. In 1947, we were forced to organize teams, first confused, then depressed (uncomfortable), and after a period of depression, we dispersed. This time, we must mobilize to maturity and ensure that one is established and one is consolidated." In the education on the eighth article of the Party member standards, the importance of cultural learning was explained from the perspective of the farmers' own needs; the education on expanding and consolidating the people's schools was combined. Experience has proven that the close integration of Party rectification and current tasks not only enriches the content of Party rectification, but also greatly promotes various tasks through Party rectification.

    **New Atmosphere After Party Rectification**

    Because Party members have recognized the direction of rural production and attached importance to the Party's leadership in cooperative and mutual aid production; after Party rectification, in Gelou Township, under the leadership of Party members and preventing the coercive and commanding style, the number of mutual aid teams has increased from 12 in the past to 66 (including 58 year-round mutual aid teams and 8 seasonal mutual aid teams). The number of Party members participating in mutual aid teams has increased from 45 to 134. All groups have established production plans for 1953: the township plans to dig 47 wells, lower 26 springs, lend 27 water carts, 27 new-style walking plows, 15 sprayers, 12 weeding hoes, purchase 115,000 jin of soybean cakes, plow 38 mu of land, and plant 1,350 trees. Winter sideline production has been launched. For example, Wang Yulan's mutual aid team has pulled 9 sets of flour, Dong Zhencai's mutual aid team has done two trips of transportation, and Kang Deliang's mutual aid team has bought 5,000 jin of cottonseed for oil extraction. Supply and marketing cooperatives have been established, and the township has deposited a total of 10.39 million yuan in grain. The number of people attending people's schools has increased from 219 in the past to 501, and 7 reading groups with a total of 65 people have been organized. In short, after Party rectification, and through democratic political construction and the rectification of various organizations, all Party member cadres have become more active than before.

    葛楼乡的整党工作推动了合作互助生产
    金石开
    山东濮县一区葛楼乡包括徐庄、温庄、四合村、葛楼、萧曹邢五个自然村，共有七百九十一户，三千七百九十九口人。这五个村的党支部都是在一九三三年到一九三七年间建立的，现有党员一百九十九名。在土地改革前的各个时期，这个乡的党支部为党为人民做了不少的工作，出现了不少的久经考验的模范党员，曾历次受到上级党的表扬。但是在土地改革以后，由于缺乏教育，支部党员中产生了“革命成功”、“功臣自满”的思想和工作上的消极疲沓现象，绝大部分党员不领导和不参加合作互助的组织，部分党员滋长着资本主义剥削思想和行为，现在雇长工的一人，放高利贷的十人，有不少的人还有雇长工的打算。另外，强迫命令的作风，在温庄和萧曹邢的党员干部中也存在着。他们往往用“抽棒”、“抓阄”、“摊派”等方式去完成任务。至于“占便宜”、“化大公为小公”、铺张浪费的现象在党员干部中也很普遍。
    运用典型实例进行了生产方向和工作作风的教育
    针对上述情况，该乡在这次整党教育中，特别注意了合作化、集体化的生产方向和群众路线的工作作风的教育。在教育前，经过调查研究，搜集了各种好坏典型实例。采取了活人活事的教育方法，效果很好。
    在进行共产主义前途教育时，通过赴苏参观团的传达报告和放映幻灯等方式，介绍了苏联的集体农庄，使党员认识到大生产的优越性和共产主义社会的远景，再结合中国实际情况讲解了中国如何走向共产主义，讲解合作化、集体化的生产方向。批判资本主义的道路时，运用了以下几种典型实例：
    （一）通过富农思想的典型徐洪袍、董振山等人的检讨，推动党员对富农剥削思想和行为的批判。开始，徐洪袍在大会上检讨不深刻，因而讨论中党员对徐洪袍斗争，对他有成见的则趁机报复，说徐洪袍是“小老蒋”，当时徐洪袍的思想受到很大压力。这时工作组总结了这次运用典型失败的教训，认识到：（1）选择典型要适当，而且必须事先教育成熟；（2）批判典型的错误思想应和每个党员的自我批评相结合，孤立地批判典型，效果不良；（3）批评坏典型应和树立好典型相结合，才有积极的教育意义。为了挽回不好的影响，在第二次会议上，首先把徐洪袍历史上的功绩作了介绍，确当地指出他在土地改革后错误思想发展的根源和危害，徐洪袍也向大家承认错误，表示愿意放弃剥削，参加互助组。大家都很满意。第二个作检讨的是董振山，他说：“过去我给地主扛活，受尽了剥削和压迫，土地改革翻了身，落疤忘了疼，屡次冒名贷款、盖瓦房、买地、添牲口、打谱于来年雇工，又转过来想剥削别人，要不整党，过几年就要成了富农了，都和我一样的想法，还能走到共产主义吗？”当晚，工作组领导大家针对徐洪袍、董振山思想联系检查自己，讨论中，有十个放高利贷的，一个作投机买卖的和买地打算发展成富农的都作了自我批评。
    （二）通过邻乡王安忠合作社的典型报告和单干户生产量对比，使党员认识合作互助的生产方向。在王安忠合作社的会计王丕义作报告之前，工作组搜集了党员的疑问。王丕义在会上首先介绍了合作社成立发展巩固的经过，接着通过算细账把合作前后两年的土地产量作了对比，他说：“俺社八户社员共有土地一百八十二亩，合作前的一九五一年总产量是三万五千斤，合作后的一九五二年的总产量是六万斤，最后宣布了一九五三年的计划，保证增产到十三万五千八百斤，除去八户八十九口人的全年开支，能余八万零二百斤，准备购新式农具，增加肥料，盖新房子改善生活。当场党员们提出很多问题，如“成立时欠的银行款子怎么还的？”“完成一九五三年的增产计划有什么保证？”“怎样记工、分红？、”“社员赶集、走亲戚、作点家中零活是否自由？”“妇女参加干活，孩子怎么办？”等等，王丕义都逐一地做了完满地解答。接着工作组又举出四个实例把合作互助和单干户一九五二年每亩地的平均产量加以对比：五里铺陈新聪合作社为四百八十七斤，后白庄陈百龙常年互助组为二百八十七斤，白万方临时互助组为一百六十斤，而号称庄稼秀才的单干户张良让只打粮一百四十斤。经过这些典型实例的对比教育，党员都说：“走王安忠的路，两三年生产就能发展；走徐洪袍的路，一辈子到不了共产主义。”徐庄党员检讨说：“俺庄支部过去虽然有成绩，但这几年来功臣自满，不执行党的合作互助增产运动的政策，结果，人家王安忠合作社每亩平均打粮三百三十斤，俺庄每亩只打百多斤，看起来光凭老资格是不中了。”
    （三）组织了一次幻灯宣传，放映了“苏联集体农庄生产和生活介绍”、“陈新聪合作社的成长”、“互助比单干强”等画片，使党内教育和党外发动群众相结合。
    葛楼乡在进行党员标准第三、五条教育中，有力地解决了党员干部贪污、浪费、沾光取巧等自私自利思想。该乡在讲课时，一方面讲清了党员个人利益与党和人民集体利益的正确关系，同时又以一贯自私自利的温庄党员高德起作典型检讨，来推动有同样思想的人作自我检查。
    为了在党内树立前进的榜样，在另一次典型报告会上介绍了入党二十年来在任何环境下一贯积极为党为人民工作、舍己为公、密切联系群众的模范党员王玉兰（女），并在讨论中从各村评比出六个模范党员，在大会上进行了表扬。党员普遍反映：“这次整党赏罚严明。”党的威信大大提高，有三十四个团员和群众代表申请入党。
    整党与当前各项工作紧密结合
    该乡这次整党十分注意与当前各项工作紧密结合。整党工作组入村，首先从检查和安排生产和各项工作入手，通盘地研究了完成各项工作的步骤和方法：对于一些紧迫性的临时任务如秋季征粮、扫公路积雪等，抓紧在动员准备阶段完成。对于一些季节性任务如冬耕、冬季副业生产等，则在整党过程中结合完成，时间上作适当分配，根据需要每天抽出上午或下午一晌至两晌时间让党员进行农、副业生产；其他一些长期性建设任务如合作互助、打井、信贷工作、民主建政等在整党期间主要是通过教育提高党员觉悟，打好思想基础；到整党的建设阶段，领导上统一安排，有步骤整顿巩固各种组织，作好各项工作，以巩固整党成果。其次，为了在整党中照顾各项工作，抽出无问题或问题较为轻微的党员干部十一人结合非党干部，专门领导冬耕、秋征及其他各项工作，并规定五天向支部汇报一次。第三，把党员标准八条教育与当前的各项实际工作有机结合。例如在整党动员阶段，结合形势讲解，进行了爱国主义教育，进一步说明了三年来建国的伟大成就及前后方抗美援朝的伟大胜利，结合本乡实例，肯定了该乡的成绩，批判了党员埋头生产不问政治的倾向和个别党员“嫌公粮重”的自私自利思想，以提高党员群众的爱国主义觉悟。
    在进行党员标准第七条教育中，帮助党员总结了过去因强迫命令而作坏了的几件工作并进行了群众路线的教育。例如一九五一年五月政府发动四个区的群众打临黄堤，萧曹邢的党员干部用“抽棒”的办法强迫群众出伕；一九五二年温庄的干部用“摊派”的方法强迫群众出人出钱打了一眼井，遭致群众反对。在检查总结时，采取了上下一起检查的办法，由工作组长马世义代表区里检讨了布置工作简单化，和命令主义的作风，上下责任分明，党员都很满意。因此，在具体讨论成立常年互助组时，有的党员说：“这次成立互助组可不能像一九四七年那样啦，一九四七年强迫编组，先糊涂，后苦蹙（不舒坦），苦蹙一阵就散了；这次一定要动员成熟，保证成立一个，巩固一个。”在党员标准八条教育中，从农民切身需要，说明文化学习的重要；结合进行扩大和巩固民校的教育。经验证明：整党和当前各项工作密切结合，不仅丰富了整党的内容，而且通过整党又大大地推动了各项工作。
    整党后的新气象
    由于党员认识了农村生产方向，重视了党对合作互助生产的领导；葛楼乡在整党以后，在党员带头发动下，在防止强迫命令的作风下，互助组由过去十二个增加到六十六个（其中常年互助组五十八个，季节互助组八个），党员参加互助组的由四十五人增加到一百三十四人，各个组都订立了一九五三年的生产计划：全乡准备打井四十七眼，下泉二十六眼，贷水车二十七辆，新式步犁二十七张、喷雾器十五架，耘锄十二张，购豆饼十一万五千斤，翻地三十八亩，植树一千三百五十棵。冬季副业生产开展了，如王玉兰互助组已拉粉九套，董振才互助组搞了两趟运输，康德亮互助组打油买棉子五千斤。成立了供销合作社，全乡已存入粮食折款一千零三十九万元。上民校的由过去二百一十九人增加到五百零一人，组织了读报组七个共六十五人。总之经过整党，经过民主建政和各种组织的整顿，所有党员干部都比以前积极了。
