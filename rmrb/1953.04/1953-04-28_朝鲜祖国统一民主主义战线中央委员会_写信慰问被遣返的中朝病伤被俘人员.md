Chinese People's Volunteers Returned Sick and Wounded Personnel:

You have escaped from the hellish U.S. prisoner-of-war camps and are about to return to the warm embrace of your beloved motherland. The Central Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea extends its heartfelt congratulations to you.

Under the lofty banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect your homes and defend your country, and in the heroic struggle to assist the Korean people, after unfortunately being injured and captured, you resolutely defended the honor of your motherland and the honor of noble internationalist soldiers under the cruel persecution of enemy torture and slaughter.

The Korean people have never forgotten you who, along with the soldiers of the Korean People's Army, suffered barbaric suppression and abuse. The Korean people infinitely sympathize with you and strongly support you, and fight for the early arrival of the day you will gain freedom.

Today, thanks to the unremitting efforts of the DPRK and China to strive for peace and the unanimous support of the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, you will return to the embrace of your motherland and people.

Many of your comrades are still in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, undergoing the same pain and persecution you have suffered in the past, fighting heroically without yielding, and wishing to return to the embrace of their motherland and people. The Korean people, together with the Chinese people, will continue to work hard and fight to rescue them as soon as possible.

The Korean people will never forget the glorious feats established by the outstanding sons and daughters of People's China in assisting the Korean people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The Central Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea earnestly wishes you a speedy recovery and that you become glorious fighters in the construction cause of great People's China.
