The U.S. Comment on Our Side's Number of Repatriated Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War is Not Factual
    Our side proposed a figure of around 600 sick and wounded prisoners of war to be repatriated at the Panmunjom meeting. The U.S. side stated that this number was "incredibly small," which is not factual.
    The numbers of sick and wounded prisoners of war exchanged between the two sides at the Panmunjom meeting show that the percentage of sick and wounded prisoners of war our side proposed to repatriate, out of the total of 12,000 prisoners of war held by our side, is larger than the percentage of 5,800 out of the total of 132,000 prisoners of war held by the U.S. side. The proportion of our side's number is 5 percent, while the proportion of the U.S. side's number is 4.3 percent. Even the BBC cannot deny this. The broadcasting company said that our side's repatriation number accounts for 5 percent of the total, while the U.S. side's proportion is 4 percent. Thus, it can be seen that the number proposed by our side is not "incredibly small," but rather larger than the number proposed by the U.S. side.
    The Associated Press reporter in Munsan, on the one hand, has acknowledged that our side's repatriation number accounts for 5 percent of the total number of prisoners of war, while theirs accounts for 4.3 percent. On the other hand, they claim that their repatriation number accounts for 7 percent of what they call "pro-communist prisoners of war." Everyone knows that this statement is untenable.
    The reason why our side's number accounts for 5 percent of the total number of prisoners of war held by our side is that our side will not only directly repatriate to the other side seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war who should be repatriated according to Article 109 of the Geneva Convention, but also directly repatriate to the other side slightly ill and wounded prisoners of war who should be accommodated in neutral countries according to Article 109. However, the U.S. side only prepares to repatriate 4.3 percent, which proves that it is necessary for our side to reserve the right to demand that the sick and wounded prisoners of war they have not directly repatriated be accommodated in neutral countries.

### 美方对我方遣返病伤战俘数字的评论是不合事实的

    美方对我方遣返病伤战俘数字的评论是不合事实的
    我方在板门店会议中提出了准备遣返病伤战俘六百人左右的数字，美国方面表示这个数字是“令人难以置信的少”，这是不合乎事实的。
    板门店会场上双方所交换的遣返病伤战俘的数字说明：我方所提出来准备遣返的病伤战俘数字在我方所拘留的一万二千全部战俘中的百分比，较美方所提数字五千八百人在美方所拘留的十三万二千全部战俘中的百分比要大。我方数字所占比例是百分之五，而美方数字所占的比例是百分之四·三。这一点就是英国广播公司也不能不承认。这个广播公司说我方遣返数与总数的比例是百分之五，美方的比例是百分之四。由此可见，我方所提出的数字不是“令人难以置信的少”，反而是较美方所提出的数字为大。
    美联社在汶山的记者一方面已承认我方遣返数与战俘总数的比例是百分之五，他们的是百分之四·三，另一方面却又说他们的遣返数是什么“亲共俘虏”的百分之七，这种说法任何人都知道是站不住的。
    我方的数字之所以有我方拘留战俘总数的百分之五，是因为我方不仅要将根据日内瓦公约第一百零九条应予遣返的重病伤战俘直接遣返对方，而且要将根据第一百零九条应收容于中立国的轻病伤战俘也直接遣返对方。而美国方面则只准备遣返百分之四·三，这证明我方保留权利提出要求将他们未予直接遣返的病伤战俘收容于中立国是必要的。（新华社开城十一日电）
