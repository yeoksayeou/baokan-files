    I Love the Borderlands
    Wang Yun
    Editor's Note: The following paragraphs are excerpts from the diary of a political instructor of a company in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. Although they describe events from more than two years ago, we can see from these fragments how beautiful and lovable our country's borderlands are, and how much the fraternal ethnic groups living there support and love the People's Liberation Army.
    Today, we moved to a stronghold on the Yunnan defense line, where brave and hardworking fraternal ethnic groups live. This is the border of our motherland, and also the granary of our motherland. On the continuous hills, there are continuous primeval forests. The giant trees that five people cannot embrace are entwined with rattan as thick as bowls. The primeval forests produce valuable medicinal materials such as tiger bones, deer antlers, and bear paws. Under the mountains are buried large pieces of asbestos, large grains of gold, as well as silver, copper, iron, and large amounts of tin ore.
    There is no severe winter here, and the trees are evergreen all year round. There are tall coconut trees, short pineapples, large areas of sugar cane and banana groves, and hillsides covered with cinchona trees. The strange flowers and herbs all over the mountains and plains emit an intoxicating fragrance.
    This is the rich borderlands of the motherland, the beautiful and lovable borderlands.

    I led the troops into Mengla Dam.
    The road from the county town to Mengla Dam is very difficult to walk. For ninety li, it is always downhill, and there is not a single household in the middle. Going down the hillside, the air pressure gradually decreases, and it feels a bit stuffy, but it is by no means like what people in the interior imagine: "Colorful and poisonous gases everywhere."
    Mengla Dam is the only flat坝 (a flat open space) in the surrounding hundreds of miles of mountains, as flat as a mirror. Seen from the mountains, the villages and houses are like models placed on a sand table. Everywhere is abundant rice, and when the breeze blows, it is simply a golden ocean. The Mengla River cuts the flat坝 in half, and there are young people fishing and girls washing clothes by the river.
    Not far from the village, we saw the joint defense sentry post. A child suddenly raised his hand and shouted behind us. We were stunned, and just as we were afraid of a misunderstanding, we suddenly heard gongs and drums beating in the village, and a group of people squeezed out of the dense coffee tree forest. A translator ran over to tell us that the masses in the village had come to welcome us.
    The neat ranks of the joint defense team were lined up in the front, and the flintlocks gleamed in the setting sun. The girls of the Young Pioneers team were all wearing black skirts and white tops, the Young Pioneer members were frantically beating gongs and drums, and people crowded up, shaking hands, offering flowers, and rushing to carry our luggage, all the way to the entrance of the township government.
    In the evening, a bonfire was lit on the lawn, and a welcome party began. The Yi girls danced the welcome dance. At the end of the dance, the girls ran towards us, putting red and green silk scarves around the necks of the soldiers, and pulling us to dance. Some soldiers ran away shyly. The translator quickly said, "Yi girls only pull the people they respect the most to dance with them; not dancing means looking down on them." Only then did we dare not run away, and we danced with them. After the dance, the fifth squad also performed a play "Capture the Bandit Chief and Render Great Service," and the whole platoon danced the Yangko dance and sang the song "Ode to the Motherland." The party was filled with the emotions of national unity and friendship, and did not end until late at night.
    When the party was over and almost everyone was asleep, we could still hear the children's songs on the lawn:
    "Chairman Mao, the savior,
    The People's Liberation Army, are our loved ones,
    We will always follow Chairman Mao,
    We will always love the People's Liberation Army."

    We arrived at Haini Village, where all the residents are of the Haini ethnic group.
    When it was time to make lunch, I went out to buy vegetables; I ran to one house, and the old folks said "no"; I ran to two houses, three houses, and they all said "no." But I clearly saw that every Haini person grew vegetables, and I even saw a basket full of green beans, eggplants, pumpkins, and peppers in one house. Why did they say "no"? After being turned down three times in a row, I felt uneasy: Did we violate any of the Haini people's rules? I felt strange and frustrated, and went back to the company in a sullen mood.
    As soon as I entered the door, the squad leader of the fourth squad asked me in a strange tone: "Political Instructor, why are you buying so many vegetables? They will spoil if we can't finish them!" When I looked, there was a large pile of various vegetables on the table. I was really confused. Seeing me stunned, the squad leader continued, "The vegetables were sent by two old folks just now. They also said that you bought them, and the money has been paid. They just told us to collect the vegetables and not worry about anything else." This made me even more confused. So I found a translator and led me to the two families who had sent the vegetables. It turned out that they were the two families I had gone to buy vegetables from earlier. Only then did I understand, and the translator smiled, and said, "That's just the way we Haini people are. We love the People's Liberation Army, so we are willing to give you things to eat. You just arrived and haven't settled down yet, but you came out to buy vegetables. The Haini people feel bad about it, so they secretly sent the vegetables over."
    Just as we turned around to go back, another old man came to deliver vegetables. The full basket of vegetables also had a few eggs on top. It turned out that this old man was the third family I had gone to buy vegetables from. As soon as he saw me, he smiled and said, "Didn't you want vegetables? I've brought them to you."
    "I didn't want them, I wanted to buy them!" I quickly explained to him.
    "Buy! I'm not a businessman, I don't sell!"
    "That won't do! We can't eat your vegetables for nothing!"
    "Why not? You can accept what other people send, and you have to accept what I send! Otherwise, you're looking down on me." The old man was a little anxious, and as he spoke, he dumped the vegetables on the bed. The translator explained for a long time, but could not convince him. Seeing that things were not going well, I took a piece of salt weighing about a pound and put it in the old man's basket; he didn't want it, but I had a reason, I said, "I'll accept your vegetables, and you have to accept my salt! If you don't, you're looking down on me." The old man paused for a long time before saying a word: "Okay! I'll accept it. We'll be together for a long time, we'll talk about it later!" He carried the basket and left.

    我爱边疆
    王云
    编者按：以下几段是从解放军某部一个连指导员的日记中摘录下来的，虽然写的是两年多以前的事情，但我们从这些片断中可以看出我们祖国的边疆是多么美丽和可爱，聚居在那里的兄弟民族对人民解放军是多么拥护和爱戴。
    今天我们移驻云南国防线上的一个据点，这里居住着勇敢勤劳的兄弟民族。这里是祖国的边境，又是祖国的富仓。在连绵不断的山岗上，耸立着连绵不断的原始森林，五个人抱不住的参天大树上缠绕着碗口粗的白藤。在原始森林里出产虎骨、鹿茸、熊掌等贵重药材，山底下埋藏着大块的石绵、大粒的金砂，还有银、铜、铁和大量的锡矿。
    这里没有严寒的冬天，树木四季常青。这里有高高的椰子树，有矮矮的菠萝，有大片大片的甘蔗、芭蕉林，有遍山的金鸡纳霜树。漫山遍野的奇花异草，发散着醉人的香味。
    这就是祖国富饶的边疆，美丽可爱的边疆。

    我带着部队进驻猛拉坝。
    从县城到猛拉坝的路很难走，九十里地一直是下坡，中间没有一户人家。下到半坡，气压渐渐地低下来，觉得有点闷，但也绝不像内地人们所想像的：“五光十色，到处皆瘴”。
    猛拉坝是周围数百里群山中唯一的平坝，平的像面镜子。从山上看，村庄和房屋就像摆在沙盘上的模型。遍地是丰盛的稻谷，微风吹来，简直是一片金色的海洋。猛拉河把平坝切成两半，河边有打鱼的青年和洗衣的姑娘。
    离村不远的地方，我们看到了联防的岗哨。一个儿童突然举起手在我们背后大叫起来，我们愣住了，正在怕发生误会的时候，忽然听到村上锣鼓喧天，从密密的咖啡树林里挤出一群人来。一个翻译跑来告诉我们，村里的群众来欢迎我们了。
    联防队整整齐齐的行列排在最前面，明火枪在夕阳斜照下闪闪发光。少年儿童队的姑娘们一律穿着黑裙子和白上衣，儿童团员们狂热地打着锣鼓，人们一拥而上，握手、献花，抢着背我们的行李，一直把我们送到乡政府门口。
    晚上，在草坪上烧起了篝火，欢迎晚会开始了。僰族姑娘们跳欢迎舞，跳到最后，姑娘们向我们奔来，用红绿绸子套着战士们的脖子，拉我们去跳，有些战士害羞地跑了。翻译很快地来说：“僰族姑娘对自己最敬爱的人，才拉他们一块跳舞；不跳，就是看不起她们。”我们这才不敢跑了，并和他们一起跳起舞来。跳完了舞，五班还演出了一个“活捉匪首立大功”的戏，全排又跳了秧歌舞，唱了“歌唱祖国”的歌子。晚会充满着民族团结友爱的情感，直到深夜才散。
    会散了，人们差不多都睡了，还听见草坪上的儿童们的歌声：
    “毛主席，救命星，
    解放军，是亲人，
    永远跟着毛主席，
    永远热爱解放军。”
                        ×        ×        ×
    我们到了海尼寨，这里住的全是海尼族。
    做午饭的时候，我出去买菜；跑了一家，老乡说“没有”；跑了两家、三家，都说“没有”。可是我明明看到海尼人每家都种的有菜，而且还看到一家筐子里放着很多豆角、茄子、南瓜、辣子，为什么说“没有”呢？一连碰了三个钉子，使我心里不安起来：是不是我们犯了海尼人的什么规矩？我有些奇怪，也有些懊丧，闷闷地回到连里。
    一进门，四班长就带着奇怪的口气问我：“指导员，你买这么多菜干什么，吃不完要坏呀！”我一看，桌子上放了一大堆各种各样的菜。我真有点摸不着头脑。班长见我发愣，接着又说：“菜是两个老乡刚才送来的，他们还说是你买的，钱都付清了，只叫我们收菜，不叫我们管别的。”这使我更加莫名其妙了。于是就找了一个翻译，引我到送菜的那两家去，原来就是我刚才先去买菜那两家送的。我这才有了底，翻译也笑了，他说：“我们海尼人就是这个脾气，我们热爱解放军，就愿意把东西送给你们吃。你们刚来，还没有住下，就出来买菜，海尼人心里过不去，就偷偷地把菜送来了。”
    我们刚转身回去，又有一个老头送菜来了。满满一筐菜上还放着几个鸡蛋，原来这个老头就是我去买菜的第三家。他一看到我就笑嘻嘻地说：“你不是要菜吗？我给你送来了。”
    “我不是要，是想买！”我连忙给他解释。
    “买！我不是生意人，不卖！”
    “那怎么行！我们不能白白地吃你的菜呀！”
    “怎么不行？别人送来的收下，我送来的也得收下！不然就是看不起我。”老头有点着急了，说着就把菜往床上一倒。翻译同志解释了好久，也没有说服他。我看事情不好下台，顺手拿了约有一斤来重的一块盐巴，放在老头的筐子里；他不要，我也有理了，我说：“我收下你的菜，你就得收下我的盐！不要，你也是看不起我。”老人停了好大一会，才说了一句话：“好！我收下了，咱们在一块的日子长着哩，以后再说吧！”他背起筐子走了。
