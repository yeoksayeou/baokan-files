Due to the bureaucratic attitude of individuals who are extremely irresponsible towards state property, the quality of the major overhaul project on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line between Pingyuan and Gushan last year was very poor, resulting in significant losses of state assets.

On the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line between Pingyuan and Gushan, many sections had steel rails that were worn down and sleepers that were decayed. In 1952, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government approved a plan submitted by the Jinan Railway Administration to carry out a major overhaul of 34 kilometers of the line at that location, investing 37.2 billion yuan, and instructed the bureau to commence work in the third quarter of 1952.

From the outset, the leadership of the Jinan Railway Administration adopted an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude toward this arduous and challenging task. Without conducting proper research or making arrangements, they simply pushed the responsibility onto the bureau's Engineering Department. After accepting this task, the Engineering Department took an even more intolerable bureaucratic approach. They failed to promptly prepare for construction, neglecting to send personnel to investigate the line's defects, failing to develop a detailed construction plan, and neglecting to equip the work crews with the necessary transportation. They hastily organized a "Jinan Major Repair Engineering Team," and the appointed captain, Zhou Xiangde, was a complete layman when it came to major overhaul projects. The vice-captain, Liu Shiming, although a technician from the Engineering Department, also lacked practical experience. When the Jinan and Yanzhou Engineering Sections assigned grassroots cadres and workers to the major repair engineering team, there was also a phenomenon of departmentalism that disregarded the overall situation. Among the workers sent by the Jinan Engineering Section, none knew how to align tracks; the workers sent by the Yanzhou Engineering Section were either old and weak or ill, and one worker even suffered from mental illness. The bureau's Engineering Department turned a blind eye to this situation, and in order to "save trouble," pushed the responsibility of leading the major repair engineering team to the Jinan Railway Sub-bureau, arbitrarily setting a deadline to complete the task by the end of November.

Due to the lack of a high sense of political responsibility and the extremely irresponsible bureaucratic attitude adopted by leaders at all levels of the Jinan Railway Administration towards this arduous task, the project was delayed until late October before it reluctantly commenced. Chaos ensued after work began. In order to complete its loading tasks, the Jinan Railway Sub-bureau disregarded the construction situation of the major overhaul project and transported ballast to the construction site first, unloading it randomly everywhere, making the process of digging out the original ballast and threading in the sleepers extremely difficult, resulting in serious waste. The transportation vehicles equipped by the Engineering Department for the engineering team were of extremely poor quality, and accidents occurred twice on the dozens of kilometers between Jinan Station and the construction site. When these problems occurred, Captain Zhou Xiangde requested assistance from the Engineering Department of the Jinan Railway Administration, but the person in charge of the Engineering Department said: "You are under the leadership of the Jinan Railway Sub-bureau, so I don't care." Zhou Xiangde had no choice but to request a solution from the Engineering Section of the Jinan Railway Sub-bureau, but the section chief said: "Without an official order from higher authorities, what am I going to use to lead you! The Engineering Section is about to be abolished, and I don't even know who I'll be reporting to!" As a result, many of the major repair engineering team's difficulties could not be resolved in a timely manner.

In November, after the Engineering Section of the Jinan Railway Sub-bureau was abolished, the major repair engineering team was still under the leadership of the Engineering Department of the Jinan Railway Administration. Instead of considering how to ensure the quality of the major overhaul and truly achieve safe train operation, the leadership of the Engineering Department used mandatory orders to urge the major repair engineering team to complete the task within a limited time. The level of confusion in personnel organization and work procedures throughout the entire project was astonishing. When replacing sleepers, those that should not have been replaced were, and those that should have been were not. Even new sleepers that had just been installed during the maintenance period in the first half of 1952 were replaced. None of the 30,000 sleepers were drilled, and when driving in the spikes, they were hammered in with iron hammers, causing some of the sleepers to split. The screening of ballast was incomplete; the disassembled steel rail fittings were discarded everywhere, and no one cared even when they were buried in the ballast. The waste during construction was astonishing, with a loss of 17,000 workdays in labor alone. The quality of the project was extremely poor, with more than 90 percent of the spikes in the rail replacement area floating, the superelevation of curves exceeding the regulations by a factor of two, the left and right levels differing by 24 millimeters, and the track gauge being 16 millimeters too wide, directly affecting train speed and safety. The train speed between Dajiachuang and Chaomidian before the overhaul was 65 kilometers per hour, but after the overhaul it decreased to 40 kilometers per hour. Workers were very dissatisfied, saying: "The lines we maintain are better than this major overhaul, and they are wasting good materials for nothing." In particular, the workers transferred from various engineering sections to the major repair engineering team to do supplementary repairs were even more dissatisfied, saying: "We've never seen anything like this before—major repairs being done at the front, and medium repairs following behind."

These irresponsible bureaucrats showed extreme disregard for the workers' life safety and health. Workers were constantly moving along the tracks, but medical care, accommodation, and meals were not adequately provided.

The Supervision Office of the Jinan Railway Administration raised concerns about this serious situation with the leaders of the major repair engineering team and the Engineering Department in early November of last year. However, the Engineering Department ignored it. In late December, the Supervision Department issued a special report demanding immediate resolution, but it still did not attract the attention of the Administration. They only exchanged opinions with the Engineering Department and the Supervision Office, viewing the principled differences as a matter of the relationship between the Engineering Department and the Supervision Office. In January of this year, after higher authorities issued the call to oppose bureaucracy, oppose commandism, and oppose violations of law and discipline, the leaders of the Jinan Railway Administration finally paid attention to this matter and organized relevant departments to conduct an on-site inspection on January 28. The Director of the Engineering Department then tentatively admitted his mistakes.

    津浦铁路平原至崮山间线路
    大修工程无人负责质量低劣浪费巨大
    对国家资财极不负责的官僚主义者，使济南铁路管理局去年津浦线平原至崮山间的线路大修工程质量非常低劣，损失了大量资财。
    津浦铁路平原至崮山间的线路上，有不少地段钢轨磨耗、枕木腐朽了。一九五二年中央人民政府铁道部批准了济南铁路管理局提出的在该地段进行三十四公里线路的大修计划，投资三百七十二亿元，并令该局于一九五二年第三季度开工。
    济南铁路管理局领导上对这一繁重而艰巨的任务，一开始即采取了不负责任的官僚主义态度，没有研究、布置，便推给该局工务处去办。该局工务处在接受此一任务后，更采取了不能容忍的官僚主义态度，没有抓紧进行施工的准备，没有派人到线路上调查病害情况，没有制订周密的施工计划和配备必要的交通工具，只草率地组织了一个“济南大修工程队”，配备的队长周香德，对大修工程完全外行，副队长刘世明虽是工务处的技术员，也缺乏实际工作经验。济南、兗州两工务段在配备大修工程队的基层干部和工人时，也存在本位主义不顾大局的现象。济南工务段派去的工人中，竟没有人会拨道；兗州工务段派去的工人中，不是老弱就是有病，甚至派去了一个患精神病的工人。对这种情况，该局工务处也不闻不问，并且为了“省事”，把对大修工程队的领导责任推给济南铁路分局，并主观主义地限期在十一月底前完成任务。
    由于济南铁路管理局各级领导对如此艰巨的任务缺乏高度的政治责任心，采取了极端不负责任的官僚主义态度，致使工程拖到十月下旬才勉强开工，开工后十分混乱。济南铁路分局为了完成装车任务，竟不管大修工程施工情况，先把碴石运到工地，到处乱卸，以致使扒出原有碴石和串入枕木，都费了很大的事，造成了严重的浪费。工务处配备给工程队的交通车质量极坏，自济南站开至工地只有几十里路，就出了两次事故。当这些问题发生后，队长周香德要求济南铁路管理局工务处协助解决时，工务处负责人说：“你们归济南铁路分局领导了，我不管。”周香德只得到济南铁路分局工务科请求解决，该科科长又说：“上级没有公事命令，我拿什么来领导你！工务科将要撤销了，我还不知道归谁领导呢！”因此，大修工程队的许多困难都不能及时克服。
    十一月，济南铁路分局工务科撤销后，大修工程队仍归济南铁路管理局工务处领导。该处领导上根本不考虑如何很好地保证大修质量，真正达到行车安全，却一味用强迫命令的方法，督促大修工程队限期完成任务。在整个工程进行中，人员组织、工作程序的混乱情况，达到了惊人的程度。换枕木时，不该换的换了，该换的反没有换，甚至一九五二年上半年维修期间刚换上去的新枕木也换下来了。三万根枕木都没有钻眼，钉道钉时，用铁锤硬砸进去，有的枕木就被砸劈了；石碴清筛不彻底；拆下来的钢轨配件到处乱丢，甚至埋在石碴内也无人过问。施工中的浪费惊人，只人工即浪费一万七千个工日。工程的质量更是低劣到极点，换轨地区道钉浮起达百分之九十以上，曲线超高较规定大一倍，左右水平相差二十四公厘，轨距大十六公厘，直接影响了行车速度和安全。大修前党家庄至炒米店间行车速度每小时为六十五公里，大修后反下降至四十公里。工人非常不满，说：我们维修的线路都比大修强，好材料给他们白白蹧蹋了。特别是从各工务段调来给大修工程队作补修的工人更是不满，他们说：从来也没见过——前边做大修，后边跟着做中修。
    这种不负责任的官僚主义者极端漠视工人的生命安全和身体健康。工人在线路上工作，经常流动，而医疗、住宿和吃饭均未得到应有照顾。
    这一严重情况，济南铁路管理局监察室在去年十一月初即向大修工程队、工务处领导上提出意见。但工务处却置之不理。十二月下旬，监察部门又作出专门报告，要求立即解决，但仍未引起管理局重视，仅与工务处和监察室交换意见，把原则性的分歧看成是工务处与监察室的关系问题。今年一月，在上级提出反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的号召后，济南铁路管理局领导上才对这件事引起了重视，于一月二十八日组织有关部门到现场实地检查，工务处长才初步承认了自己的错误。
