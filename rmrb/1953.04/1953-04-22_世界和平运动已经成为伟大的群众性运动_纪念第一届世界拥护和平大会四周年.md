    The World Peace Movement Has Become a Great Mass Movement
    —Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of the First World Congress of Partisans of Peace
    It has been four full years since the First World Congress of Partisans of Peace was held in Paris and Prague from April 20 to 25, 1949. The organized world peace movement that began with this congress, after four years of extensive and in-depth development, has become a great mass movement that includes people from all walks of life in all countries, and has severely hit the war-mongers' schemes and plans to prepare and launch wars.
    Due to the aggressive and war policies pursued by the US ruling clique, which seriously threaten the personal safety and lives of people in all countries, people everywhere strongly demand peace and oppose the US war policies. The birth and development of the world peace movement is the concentrated expression of this will of the people of all countries. In 1949, when the United States organized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and intensified preparations for war, 2,005 delegates from 72 countries held the First World Congress of Partisans of Peace, and the organized peace movement began to take shape on a world scale. After the congress, peace organizations were established in 81 countries. Many countries organized local and enterprise peace committees, and 150,000 peace committees were established in 75 countries. After the United States moved from preparing for a war of aggression to direct acts of aggression and launched the war of aggression against Korea in 1950, peace-loving people around the world held the Second World Peace Congress, at which the command post of the World Peace Movement – the World Peace Council – was established, raising even higher the banner of opposing war and defending peace. In the years following this congress, the peace movement greatly expanded throughout the world. In the past two years, many regions of the world have held regional peace conferences, such as the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, the American Peace Congress, and the Nordic Peace Congress. Last year and this year, workers, women, and youth from various countries held international professional conferences to defend peace, such as the International Social Insurance Conference for the Protection and Promotion of Workers' Social Insurance Rights, the International Children's Defense Conference for the Protection of Children's Welfare, and the International Conference for the Protection of Youth Rights for the Protection of the Social and Economic Rights of Youth. Countless peace gatherings, large and small, have been held in various countries. All these world, regional, local, and professional conferences have put forward clear demands for peace, thus expanding the foundation of the peace movement, uniting millions of peace-loving people in the ranks of defending peace, and developing the struggle to defend peace ever more magnificently.
    The current breadth of the world peace movement is reflected in the fact that people of various nationalities, with various political views and religious beliefs, and various social strata are actively fighting to maintain peace. As the war threat created by the United States grows, and as the lies of the war-mongers are constantly exposed, the vast majority of people increasingly realize that peace cannot be waited for, but must be strived for, and therefore actively participate in the peace movement. This breadth of the current peace movement is most clearly reflected in the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna last December. Participants in this congress included workers, farmers, intellectuals, and representatives of various religious faiths, as well as social celebrities, members of parliament, government officials, and entrepreneurs from capitalist countries. Of the more than 1,800 delegates to the congress, about 400 had not previously participated in the peace movement. Many members of parliament from Western European countries who had previously voted in favor of the North Atlantic Treaty also attended the congress and opposed aggressive military pacts, advocating that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty. Many well-known figures, such as Italian Catholic Democratic Party parliamentarian Terranova, former German Chancellor Wirth, French bourgeois writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who had participated in the so-called "International Day of Resistance to War and Dictatorship" organized by the United States in 1949 to slander the peace movement, Cook, an activist of Argentine President Peron's party, and Swiss pacifist Bovard, all participated in the congress. The delegations from many countries participating in the congress had broad representation. For example, the Indian delegation included members of the Congress Party, Gandhians, Communists, People's Party members, Workers and Peasants Party members, and members of the "All India Forward Bloc."
    A prominent feature of the current world peace movement is that more and more people are taking concerted action to strike at the war conspiracies of the imperialists. People in various countries are demanding peaceful consultations to replace the use of force with ever-increasing strength.
    Peace-loving people in all countries demand an end to all existing wars on a fair and reasonable basis, starting with the Korean War. People in many countries have launched broad movements calling for an end to the Korean War and opposing the conspiracy to continue and expand the Korean War. The people of India held an "Action Day" on February 27 this year to stop Eisenhower from expanding the Korean War. The people of Japan held a national peace conference in late March, passing a resolution calling for an immediate end to the Korean War. People in Burma, Ceylon, and other countries have held many peace rallies or issued statements calling for an immediate ceasefire in Korea. Across Canada, "Korean Armistice Day" was held on February 28. British workers have widely launched a movement demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and "no war with China," and the British Second National Women's Congress, attended by more than 2,200 delegates, passed a resolution calling for an immediate end to the Korean War. In the United States, too, a movement calling for an immediate ceasefire in Korea has been launched. Especially after China and North Korea put forward new proposals at the end of March, the movement calling for an end to the Korean War has intensified in countries around the world. Peace-loving people in all countries demand that the US government accept the proposals of China and North Korea and quickly end the Korean War.
    Peace-loving people in all countries are actively demanding disarmament, opposing war preparations, and opposing the imperialists' organization of aggressive armies and alliances. The people of Western European countries such as Germany and France have launched a powerful movement against the rearmament of West Germany and against the "European Army" treaty. Last November, representatives from fifteen countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany, held an international conference in Berlin to strive for a peaceful resolution of the German question, supporting the German people's struggle against rearmament and for German reunification. Due to the united and firm struggle of the people of Western Europe, the "European Army" treaty has not yet been ratified by the parliaments of all Western European countries. The people of Western European countries are also actively opposing the expansion of armaments, and the United States' conspiracy to force Western European countries to extend the term of military service has been defeated in many countries. In Asia, six million Japanese people have signed a petition against rearmament and demanding comprehensive peace, and the Japanese people's heroic struggle against rearmament has been supported by the people of Asian countries. In the Near East and the Middle East, people in various countries have launched a movement against the conspiracy of US and British imperialists to organize a Middle East aggressive bloc, which has prevented this conspiracy from being realized so far. In Latin America, people in countries such as Brazil have launched a movement against signing military agreements with the United States.
    Peace-loving people in all countries oppose the use of weapons of mass destruction and demand the prohibition of atomic and bacteriological weapons. Five hundred million people have signed the Stockholm Declaration banning the use of atomic weapons. After the US military committed the heinous crime of bacteriological warfare against Korea and Northeast China last year, people in various countries launched a worldwide protest movement demanding that the United States be stopped from engaging in bacteriological warfare.
    Peace-loving people in all countries demand economic and cultural exchanges between countries. With the active preparation of peace activists in various countries, an international economic conference was held in Moscow last year, where representatives from economic circles in 49 countries gathered to discuss the issue of restoring and expanding trade between East and West. After this conference, a movement opposing the United States' ban on trade between Western European and Asian countries and the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern European people's democracies, and demanding the restoration and expansion of trade between East and West, is developing in Western European and Asian countries.
    Peace-loving people in all countries demand that the five major powers conduct consultations and conclude a peace treaty. More than 600 million people have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace treaty between the five major powers. Especially after the Letter to the Governments of the Five Great Powers Committee, appointed by the World People's Peace Congress, wrote to the governments of the five great powers in March this year, requesting them to hold consultations to conclude a peace treaty, a broad movement advocating consultations between the governments of the five great powers is flourishing around the world.
    Peace-loving people in all countries know that they need to make greater efforts to achieve their struggle goals. Because the enemies of peace are still doing their best to prevent the relaxation of international tensions and are still pursuing a policy of war. However, peace-loving people in all countries are also deeply convinced that as long as they develop the peace movement more widely, so that more people resolutely take on the cause of peace and carry it through to the end, peace will surely be maintained and consolidated.

    世界和平运动已经成为伟大的群众性运动
    ——纪念第一届世界拥护和平大会四周年
    自从第一届世界拥护和平大会于一九四九年四月二十日至二十五日在巴黎与布拉格举行以来，已经整整四年了。从这次大会开始形成的有组织的世界和平运动，经过四年来广泛深入的发展，已经成为包括世界各国广泛阶层人民在内的伟大的群众性运动，并且沉重地打击了战争贩子们准备战争、发动战争的阴谋计划。
    由于美国统治集团实行的侵略政策和战争政策严重地威胁到世界各国人民的切身安全和生活，各国人民都强烈要求和平，反对美国的战争政策。世界和平运动的诞生和发展，就是各国人民这种意志的集中表现。在一九四九年美国组织北大西洋侵略集团，加紧准备战争的时候，来自七十二个国家的二千零五名代表举行了第一届世界拥护和平大会，世界规模的有组织的和平运动开始形成。在大会以后，八十一个国家中建立了和平组织。许多国家都组织了各地方与各企业的和平委员会，在七十五个国家中成立的和平委员会有十五万个。在美国一九五○年从准备侵略战争进入直接侵略行动而发动侵略朝鲜的战争以后，全世界爱好和平的人民举行了第二届世界保卫和平大会，在这次大会上建立了世界和平运动的司令台——世界和平理事会，更高地举起了反对战争、保卫和平的大旗。在这次大会以后的数年中，和平运动在世界各地大大展开了。在前年和去年，全世界许多地区举行了区域性的和平会议，如亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议、美洲和平大会、北欧国家和平大会等。在去年和今年，各国工人、妇女、青年分别举行了保卫和平的国际性专业会议，如保卫和争取工人的社会保险权利的国际社会保险会议、保卫儿童福利的国际保卫儿童大会、保卫青年的社会与经济权利的国际保卫青年权利会议等。在各国更举行了大大小小的无数和平集会。所有这些世界性的、区域性的、地方性的、各行各业的会议都提出了要求和平的鲜明主张，因而扩大了和平运动的基础，把千千万万爱好和平的人民团结到保卫和平的行列中来，并且把保卫和平的斗争开展的日益雄壮。
    当前世界和平运动的广泛性，表现在各种不同民族、具有各种不同政治见解和宗教信仰、各种不同社会阶层的人们都积极起来为维护和平而斗争。由于美国所制造的战争威胁日益增长，由于战争贩子的谎言不断被揭露，广大人民日益认识到和平不能坐待，必须争取，因而积极参加进和平运动里来。当前和平运动这种广泛性最明显地反映在去年十二月在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会上。参加这次大会的有工人、农民、知识分子及各种宗教信徒的代表，有资本主义国家的社会名流、国会议员、政府官员、企业家等等。参加大会的一千八百多位代表中，约有四百人在以前没有参加过和平运动。不少曾经投票赞成北大西洋公约的西欧国家的国会议员，也来参加了大会，并且反对侵略性的军事公约，主张五大国缔结和平公约了。许多著名人士，如意大利天主教民主党议员泰伦诺瓦，德国前总理
    维尔特，曾经在一九四九年参加过美国所组织的
    诽谤和平运动的所谓“抵抗战争与独裁国际日”的
    法国资产阶级名作家让·保罗·萨特，阿根廷总统
    庇隆的党的活动家库克，瑞士非战主义者波瓦尔等
    人都参加了大会。参加大会的许多国家的代表团都
    有广泛的代表性，例如印度代表团里就有国大党
    人、甘地主义者、共产党人、人民党人、工农党人和“全印前进同盟”的成员等。
    当前世界和平运动的显著特色是：越来越多的人民正以一致的行动，打击着帝国主义者的战争阴谋。各国人民以越来越大的力量，要求以和平协商代替武力解决。
    各国爱好和平人民要求在公平合理的基础上停止一切现有战争，首先是停止朝鲜战争。许多国家的人民都开展了广泛的运动，要求停止朝鲜战争，反对继续并扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。印度人民在今年二月二十七日举行了制止艾森豪威尔扩大朝鲜战争的“行动日”。日本人民在三月下旬举行了全国性的争取和平大会，通过要求立即停止朝鲜战争的决议。缅甸、锡兰等国人民举行了许多和平集会或发表声明，要求在朝鲜立即停战。加拿大全国各地在二月二十八日举行了“争取朝鲜停战日”。英国工人广泛展开了要求立即停止朝鲜战争、“不与中国作战”运动，有二千二百多位代表参加的英国第二届全国妇女大会通过了要求立即停止朝鲜战争的决议。在美国国内，也展开了要求立即在朝鲜停战的运动。特别在三月底中朝两国提出新建议后，世界各国人民要求停止朝鲜战争的运动益形高涨。各国爱好和平的人民要求美国政府接受中朝两国建议，迅速结束朝鲜战争。
    各国爱好和平人民积极要求裁减军备，反对战争准备，反对帝国主义者组织侵略性的军队及同盟。德国、法国等西欧国家人民展开了反对武装西德、反对“欧洲军”条约的强大运动。去年十一月，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、法国、比利时、英国、意大利以及德国等十五个国家的代表在柏林举行了国际争取和平解决德国问题会议，支援德国人民反对重新武装、争取德国统一的斗争。由于西欧人民团结一致的坚强斗争，“欧洲军”条约至今尚未能为所有西欧国家议会所批准。西欧各国人民也积极反对扩张军备，使美国迫使西欧各国延长兵役期限的阴谋在许多国家遭到了失败。在亚洲，六百万日本人民签名反对重整军备，要求全面媾和，日本人民反对重新武装的英勇斗争获得亚洲各国人民的支援。在近东和中东，各国人民展开了反对美英帝国主义者企图组织中东侵略集团阴谋的运动，使这个阴谋至今尚未能实现。在拉丁美洲，巴西等国人民已展开了反对与美国签订军事协定的运动。
    各国爱好和平人民反对使用大规模杀人武器，要求禁止原子武器及细菌武器。已有五亿人在禁止使用原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。在去年美军对朝鲜和中国东北进行罪恶的细菌战以后，各国人民展开了世界规模的抗议运动，要求制止美国进行细菌战。
    各国爱好和平人民要求各国进行经济与文化交流。在各国和平人士积极筹备下，去年在莫斯科举行了国际经济会议，四十九个国家经济界的代表共聚一堂，讨论了恢复与扩大东西方贸易的问题。在这次会议以后，反对美国禁止西欧及亚洲国家与苏联、中国和东欧人民民主国家贸易、要求恢复及扩大东西方贸易的运动，正在西欧及亚洲国家中开展。
    各国爱好和平人民要求五大国进行协商，缔结和平公约。已有六亿多人在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。特别是在世界人民和平大会所任命的致五大国政府书委员会，在今年三月间分别写信给五大国政府要求它们举行协商以缔结和平公约以后，主张五大国政府举行协商的广泛运动正在全世界蓬勃展开。
    各国爱好和平的人民深知要达到他们的斗争目标还需要尽更大的努力。因为和平的敌人现在仍然在竭力阻止国际紧张局势的缓和，仍然在推行着战争政策。但是，各国爱好和平人民同时深信，只要他们把和平运动开展得更为广泛，使更多的人把和平事业坚决地担当起来并把它进行到底，和平就一定能维持和巩固。（新华社）
