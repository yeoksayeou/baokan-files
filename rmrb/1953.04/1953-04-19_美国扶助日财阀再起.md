Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Japanese monopoly capital - the Zaibatsu - which was the mastermind and organizer of the Japanese imperialist war of aggression, is raising its head again with the support of the United States.

    In the early days of Japan's surrender, due to the pressure of the world's people, the American occupation authorities in Japan were once forced to order the dissolution of the Japanese Zaibatsu. Under the cover of the dissolution order, on the one hand, American monopoly capital took the opportunity to control the Japanese economy; on the other hand, the Japanese Zaibatsu preserved their strength by using methods such as dividing into smaller units and changing their signs. As the United States intensified its policy of reviving Japanese militarism, the Japanese monopoly capital, as the main force of Japanese militarism, recovered day by day. In 1951, the pig iron produced by the three steel companies controlled by monopoly capital accounted for 96.2 percent of Japan's total pig iron production, and steel accounted for 50.4 percent; the production of ten coal mining companies accounted for 62.9 percent of Japan's total coal production; six shipbuilding companies accounted for 73 percent; and ten cement companies accounted for 91.7 percent. After the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, Japanese monopoly enterprises, which had been dispersed on the surface, began to openly merge again and blatantly restore their original signs. The notorious Zaibatsu names such as "Mitsui," "Mitsubishi," "Sumitomo," and "Yasuda" have reappeared.
    The aggressive nature of the Japanese Zaibatsu is fully revealed in its revival process. It has formed a close and inseparable relationship with American military orders and Japan's rearmament. The "Keizai Dantai Rengokai" (Federation of Economic Organizations), an organization of Japanese big capitalists, has become the parent body of Japan's military production organization. The association has a series of organizations within it to develop military production, especially the so-called "Defense Production Committee." This committee is called by the Japanese "Economist" magazine "the headquarters for promoting rearmament and reviving the military industry." It is scheduled to have seventeen sub-committees, and eight have already been established. Their members include 130 business units, including the top ten military Zaibatsu such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Ayukawa, and Nakajima, which have become the core of leading Japan's military production.
    In collusion with the American occupiers, the Japanese Zaibatsu are still the manipulators of Japanese politics. The "Economist" revealed that the "Japan Industry Club," which has controlled Japanese politics for more than 30 years, has included the three major economic organizations of "Keizai Dantai Rengokai," "Nikkeiren" (Japan Federation of Employers' Associations), and "Keizai Doyukai" (Japan Association of Corporate Executives) after the war, and has once again become the "driving force of Japanese politics." The Japanese Zaibatsu are active supporters of the Yoshida government's policy of rearmament. International News Service once admitted that Yoshida's "government was able to win the general election in October last year (1952) mainly because large industrial and commercial groups generously donated campaign funds." After the Japanese Zaibatsu supported Yoshida's return to power in that election, they openly sent their representative, Tadaharu Mukai, the former chairman of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., to serve as the Finance Minister in the Yoshida Cabinet.
    Various sources indicate that the Japanese monopoly capital group is actively planning to manipulate the upcoming general election. They not only continue to support Yoshida's Liberal Party, but also distribute political funds to Shigemitsu's Progressive Party and Hatoyama's Liberal Party, because these parties, despite their different names, have a common proposition - rearmament, a proposition that conforms to the interests of monopoly capital. Nevertheless, facing the rising tide of the Japanese people's opposition to the rearmament movement and the low probability of any one party obtaining a majority of seats in the Diet in the general election, the Japanese monopoly capital group lacks confidence in continuing to stably manipulate Japanese politics through the general election. Kyodo News Agency's Tokyo dispatch on March 21 has revealed that the Japanese "political and business circles" "are now worried about the political situation after the general election."

### 美国扶助日财阀再起

    美国扶助日财阀再起
    据新华社讯：曾经是日本帝国主义侵略战争的主谋者和组织者的日本垄断资本——财阀，正在美国的扶植之下重新抬起头来。
    在日本投降的初期，由于世界人民的压力，美国驻日本占领当局曾经被迫下令解散日本财阀。在解散命令的掩盖之下，一方面是美国垄断资本乘机控制了日本经济；另一方面，日本财阀利用化整为零和掉换招牌的手法保存了他们的实力。随着美国加紧执行复活日本军国主义的政策，作为日本军国主义主要力量的日本垄断资本一天天恢复起来。在一九五一年，由垄断资本所掌握的三家钢铁公司所生产的铣铁占日本铣铁总产量的百分之九十六点二，钢占百分之五十点四；十家煤矿公司的生产占日本全部煤产量的百分之六十二点九；六家造船公司占百分之七十三；十家水泥公司占百分之九十一点七。旧金山和约生效以后，在表面上一度分散了的日本垄断企业开始公开重新合并，并且公然恢复原来的招牌。臭名远扬的“三井”、“三菱”、“住友”、“安田”等财阀字号，又重新出现。
    日本财阀的侵略性质，在它的复活过程中充分地显露出来。它已经和美国的军事订货与日本的重新武装形成了密切不可分的关系。日本大资本家的组织“经济团体联合会”已经成为日本军需生产组织的母体。该会的内部设有用来发展军需生产的一系列的组织，尤其是所谓“防卫生产委员会”。这个委员会被日本“经济学人”杂志叫做“促进重新武装、复兴军需产业的司令部”，它预定下设十七个小委员会，现在已经成立八个，它们的会员有一百三十个企业单位，包括三井、三菱、鲇川、中岛等十大军需财阀，成为领导日本军需生产的核心。
    在和美国占领者相互勾结的情况下，日本财阀依然是日本政治的操纵者。“经济学人”透露，过去三十多年来一直控制着日本政治的“日本工业俱乐部”，在战后包罗了“经济团体联合会”、“日本经营者团体联盟”和“经济同友会”这三大经济团体，再度成为“日本政治的原动力”。日本财阀是执行重整军备政策的吉田政府的积极支持者。国际新闻社曾经承认：吉田“政府所以能够在去年（一九五二年）十月大选中获得胜利，主要是由于大的工业和商业团体慷慨捐出了竞选经费”。日本财阀在那次大选中支持吉田重新上台之后，公开派遣他们的代表、前三井物产株式会社会长向井忠晴出任吉田内阁的藏相（财政大臣）。
    多方面的消息表明，日本垄断资本集团正在积极策划操纵即将举行的这次大选。他们不但继续支援吉田的自由党，并且也把政治资金分发给重光葵的改进党和鸠山一郎的自由党，因为这些党派尽管名称不同，但是有着共同的主张——重整军备，一种符合垄断资本利益的主张。虽然如此，面临着日本人民反对重整军备运动的一天天高涨、很少可能有一个政党在大选中取得国会的过半数议席这种情况，日本垄断资本集团对于通过大选继续稳定地操纵日本政治是缺乏信心的。共同社东京三月二十一日电已经透露，日本“政界和实业界”“现在已经对大选后的政局担忧了”。
