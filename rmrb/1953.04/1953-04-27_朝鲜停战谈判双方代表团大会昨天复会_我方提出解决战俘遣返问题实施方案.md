    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 26th: The Korean armistice talks resumed at Panmunjom at 2:00 PM on April 26th to discuss the entire issue of prisoner of war repatriation, which has been the sole obstacle to achieving a Korean armistice for the past year.

    Chief Delegate Nam Il of our side presented our concrete implementation plan for resolving the issue of total prisoner of war repatriation at the meeting. General Nam Il said:

    On March 28, 1953, our commander already pointed out that a reasonable solution to the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war should lead to the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue, so as to realize the Korean armistice desired by the people of the world. Now, not only is the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war proceeding smoothly, but our side has also proposed highly constructive suggestions for resolving the entire prisoner of war issue. Therefore, the time has come to resume the joint efforts of the delegations of both sides in the armistice talks to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue in order to achieve a Korean armistice. We have repeatedly stated that the specific implementation plan for our proposal to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue will be presented at the plenary session of the delegations of both sides. Now, after studying and considering the three specific opinions you put forward on April 16 regarding the implementation of our suggestions, we are willing to put forward our specific implementation plan as the basis for consultation and discussion at the plenary session of the delegations of both sides. The world is eager for a Korean armistice. We believe that as long as both sides have a desire for peace and in the spirit of mutual concession, the prisoner of war repatriation issue that is currently hindering the Korean armistice can be completely resolved reasonably through consultation and discussion between the two sides.

    Based on the principles of the suggestions for resolving the entire prisoner of war repatriation issue announced successively by the Government the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on March thirtieth and March thirty-first, 1953, and the explanation I put forward on April ninth of the same year, our side now puts forward the following specific implementation plan for resolving the entire prisoner of war repatriation issue:

    I. Within two months after the armistice agreement takes effect, both sides shall, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article III, Paragraph 51 of the armistice agreement, and based on the final lists exchanged and corrected by both sides, repatriate all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation in batches and hand them over to the party to which the prisoners of war belong, without any obstruction.

    II. Within a period of one month after the direct repatriation of all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation is completed, the detaining party shall be responsible for sending the remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country agreed upon by both parties and release them from its military control, and the relevant neutral country authorities shall designate an area to receive and guard them. The relevant neutral country authorities shall have the power to exercise their legitimate duties and responsibilities to control the prisoners of war under their temporary jurisdiction.

    III. The country to which these prisoners of war belong shall have the freedom and convenience to send people to the neutral country within a period of six months from the date the prisoners of war arrive in the neutral country to explain to all prisoners of war who are attached to that country, eliminate their concerns, and notify the prisoners of war of any matters related to their return home, especially that they have the full right to return home and live a peaceful life.

    IV. Within six months from the date the prisoners of war arrive in the neutral country, all prisoners of war who request to be repatriated home after being explained to by their country of origin shall be assisted by the relevant neutral country authorities to quickly return to their motherland without hindrance. The administrative details of the repatriation of these prisoners of war shall be resolved through consultation between the relevant neutral country authorities and the authorities of the country to which the prisoners of war belong.

    V. After the expiration of the six-month period stipulated in Articles III and IV of this plan, if there are still prisoners of war under the care of the neutral country, the handling method shall be submitted to the political conference stipulated in Article IV, Paragraph 60 of the armistice agreement for consultation and resolution.

    VI. All expenses of prisoners of war in neutral countries, including their travel expenses for returning to their country, shall be borne by the country to which the prisoners of war belong.

    After General Nam Il put forward our plan, Chief Delegate Harrison of the other side repeated the three specific opinions he put forward in his letter of April 16, suggested that Switzerland be the neutral country that would temporarily take in prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated after the armistice, advocated that prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated should remain in Korea and be taken in by neutral countries, emphasized the difficulties in the practical arrangements for sending these prisoners of war to neutral countries, and claimed that the six-month period proposed by our side for neutral countries to take in these prisoners of war and for the countries to which the prisoners of war belong to send people to explain to eliminate the prisoners of war's doubts was too long, and advocated that this period be limited to two months. General Nam Il pointed out that our side believes that handing over prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides is the most reasonable way to resolve the current differences between the two sides. As long as both sides have the sincerity to jointly solve the problem, practical arrangements will not be difficult and should not become an obstacle to solving the problem. At the same time, our side believes that the six-month period is necessary and reasonable. Regarding the issue of both parties agreeing on a neutral country, General Nam Il pointed out that Switzerland was the country nominated by the other party when both parties nominated neutral countries to form the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In the current situation where a neutral country needs to be agreed upon, the neutral country that was once nominated by one party is obviously completely unsuitable, and therefore firmly advocated that both parties should negotiate another neutral country separately. General Nam Il finally solemnly pointed out that our April 26 proposal is a concrete plan that is sufficient to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue, thereby leading to a Korean armistice. He hoped that the other party would give it serious study and consideration. Both parties agreed to continue to hold a plenary session of the delegations of both parties at 11:00 AM on April 27.

    In addition to Chief Delegate Nam Il, the representatives of our side attending the meeting of the delegations of both sides on April 26 included General Li Sang-cho and General Zhang Chunshan of the Korean People's Army, and General Ding Guoyu and General Chai Chengwen of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会昨天复会
    我方提出解决战俘遣返问题实施方案
    【新华社开城二十六日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十六日发表公报如下：
    朝鲜停战谈判四月二十六日下午二时在板门店复会，讨论一年来一直成为获致朝鲜停战的唯一障碍的整个战俘遣返问题。
    我方首席代表南日大将在会上提出我方关于解决全部战俘遣返问题的具体实施方案。南日大将说：
    一九五三年三月二十八日我方司令官即已指出关于在战事期间交换双方病伤战俘的问题的合理解决，应当使之引导到全部战俘问题的顺利解决，使世界人民渴望的朝鲜停战得以实现。现在，不仅双方病伤战俘的交换已经在顺利地进行，而且我方已经提出解决全部战俘问题的具有高度建设性的建议，因之恢复停战谈判双方代表团共同努力解决全部战俘问题以实现朝鲜停战的时机已经到来。关于我方解决全部战俘问题的建议的具体实施方案，我们曾一再表示过将在双方代表团大会上提出。现在我们研究并考虑了你方在四月十六日提出的关于实施我方建议的三项具体意见，愿意提出我方的具体实施方案，作为双方代表团大会协商讨论的基础。举世渴望朝鲜停战，我们相信只要双方都具有和平愿望，本着相互让步的精神，目前阻碍着朝鲜停战的战俘遣返问题是完全能在双方的协商讨论中求得合理解决的。
    根据中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九五三年三月三十日和三月三十一日先后宣布的解决全部战俘遣返问题的建议及我于同年四月九日所提出的说明的原则，我方现在提出关于解决全部战俘遣返问题的具体实施方案如下：
    一、在停战协定生效后，两个月内，双方应依照停战协定第三条第五十一款的有关规定，并根据双方所交换并校正的最后名单，将一切坚持遣返的战俘分批遣返，交给战俘所属的一方，不得加以任何阻难。
    二、在一切坚持遣返的战俘的直接遣返完成之后的一个月的期限内，拘留一方应将不直接遣返的其余战俘负责送到一个经双方协商同意的中立国家去，并从其军事控制下释放出来，由有关中立国当局指定地区加以接收和看管。该有关中立国当局应有执行其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力。
    三、此项战俘的所属国家应有自由与便利在战俘到达中立国之日起的六个月期限内，派人前往该中立国向一切依附于该所属国的战俘解释，消除他们的顾虑，并通知战俘任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全的权利。
    四、在战俘到达中立国之日起的六个月内，经其所属国家的解释之后，凡提出要求遣返回家的一切战俘，应由有关中立国当局负责协助他们迅速返回祖国，不得留难。此项战俘的遣返的行政细节，应由有关中立国当局与战俘所属国家当局协商解决。
    五、在本方案第三条和第四条所规定的六个月期满之后，如尚有在中立国看管之下的战俘，其处理办法应交由停战协定第四条第六十款所规定的政治会议协商解决。
    六、战俘在中立国家的一切费用，包括其回国旅费在内，应由战俘的所属国家负担之。
    南日大将提出我方上述方案后，对方首席代表哈利逊将军重复了他四月十六日信中所提出的三点具体意见，建议以瑞士为停战后临时收管未被直接遣返的战俘的中立国，主张将未被直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜，由中立国收管，强调将这些战俘送往中立国的实际安排中的困难，并声称我方所提出的由中立国收管这些战俘并由战俘所属国派人前往进行解释以消除战俘的疑惧的六个月的期限为太长，主张将这一期限定为两个月。南日大将指出，我方认为将停战后未被直接遣返的战俘交到双方同意的一个中立国，是解决目前双方分歧的一个最合理办法。只要双方具有合力解决问题的诚意，实际安排是不会有困难的，更不应该成为解决问题的障碍，同时，我方认为六个月的期限是必要的而且是合理的。关于双方协议一个中立国家的问题，南日大将指出，瑞士是在双方各自提名中立国组成中立国监察委员会的情况下，对方所提名的国家。在目前需要商定的是一个中立国的情况下，对方一方所曾经提名的中立国，显然是完全不合适的，因此坚决主张双方应另行协商一个中立国。南日大将最后郑重指出，我方四月二十六日的提案是一个足以解决整个战俘问题从而导致朝鲜停战的具体方案，希望对方予以慎重的研究与考虑。双方同意在四月二十七日上午十一时继续举行双方代表团大会。
    我方出席四月二十六日双方谈判代表团会议的代表，除首席代表南日大将外，有朝鲜人民军代表李相朝将军与张春山将军，中国人民志愿军代表丁国钰将军与柴成文将军。
