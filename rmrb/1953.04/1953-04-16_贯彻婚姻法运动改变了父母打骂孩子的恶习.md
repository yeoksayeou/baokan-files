    The Xiaonan Road Houjie area of Liuzhou City, Guangxi Province, is a residential area for the poor, with many children, and incidents of beating and scolding children often occur. It is understood that in the past, there were eleven households where the beating and scolding of children was particularly severe. The parents believed in the saying "spare the rod and spoil the child," believing that to discipline children well, they had to beat and scold them. Parents would often use large sticks, shoulder poles, thick ropes, and soft whips to beat children indiscriminately, leaving them covered in injuries. They would also curse them, calling them "wild kids," "bastards," "not allowed to eat," and "I'll beat you to death." The children were so beaten and scolded that they were afraid to be close to their parents. However, the children were not disciplined well; on the contrary, they became more naughty.
    After this Marriage Law Implementation Movement, parents realized that they must protect, nurture, and educate their children properly, and regretted the past beatings and scoldings. On the evening of February 3rd, a mothers' forum was held in Xiaonan Road Houjie. One mother said sadly, "I gave birth to my first child in 1947. When he was only forty days old, he often cried because he was sick. One night, he cried particularly loudly, and the neighbors were annoyed. At that time, my husband didn't provide any support, and life was very difficult. I couldn't help myself, and in a moment of impatience, I slapped the child's face. When dawn was approaching, I touched the child's head, and it was cold, and his feet were cold too. He died (crying bitterly). If my child hadn't died, he would be seven years old this year and could go to school! After liberation, I still often beat and scolded my children, using a soft whip to beat their feet, and once I even beat them until they bled. After this study session, I realized my mistake and resolved to change my bad temper and carefully educate my children using methods of comparing good and bad, comparing strengths and weaknesses." Qian Yuying also had a bad temper and often beat and scolded her children. Once, she beat her daughter until her eyes were black and her face was swollen. Another time, she used a thick rope to beat her, and yet another time, she made her daughter lie down and beat her with a shoulder pole, beating her so much that she didn't dare to eat her fill and didn't dare to pick vegetables, always peeking at her mother's eyes when picking vegetables. But every time after being beaten, the child would become naughty again in a few days. She said, "Actually, it's not that the child is naughty, but that I am not patient enough to educate her. From now on, I promise to patiently educate my children properly so that they all dare to be close to me."
    Tu Chunying is a good mother. When she spoke at the meeting, she first pointed out the harm of beating and scolding children and criticized the erroneous idea of "spare the rod and spoil the child." Then, she shared her methods of educating her children. She said, "My child is fourteen years old this year and is studying in middle school! I have never beaten or scolded him, and I have always patiently educated him. If he doesn't learn something the first time, I teach him again the second time; I also don't yell at him to scare him. That way, he likes to be close to me very much and listens to me very well." Moreover, she believes that educating children well so that they can grow up and serve the people well is the mother's responsibility and honor. The kind and amiable Grandma Hu is also very patient in educating her children, not beating or scolding them, nor scaring them. The children are all very close to her and considerate of her. This is how she educates her children: "I first educate the first one well, and then the others are led by him, so they are all very good and very smart. I have a total of eight children, five of whom are working, and three are still in school."
    Speaking of this, everyone felt very happy and enthusiastically discussed methods of educating children, all willing to learn from Grandma Hu and Tu Chunying and promising to cherish their children in the future.
    Since then, people walking into Xiaonan Road Houjie no longer hear the angry scolding of parents and the crying of children. What they see are parents patiently educating and encouraging their children, and children obediently answering. Qian Yuying's thirteen-year-old daughter broke a basin. At first, she didn't dare to admit it, fearing that her mother would beat her. But Qian Yuying, after the study session, not only didn't beat her this time but instead said very gently, "It doesn't matter if you broke it; you have to be more careful in the future. We don't have that much money to buy things!" The daughter obediently admitted her mistake and said sadly, "Mom! I'll be careful in the future." The facts educated Qian Yuying and also educated many parents: Educating children must not be done with a crude attitude.

### 贯彻婚姻法运动改变了父母打骂孩子的恶习

    贯彻婚姻法运动改变了父母打骂孩子的恶习
    广西省柳州市小南路后街是贫民住宅区，小孩子很多，打骂小孩的事情也常发生。据了解，过去打骂小孩很厉害的有十一户。父母们相信“棒头出好仔”，认为把孩子管教好就必须打骂。父母们动不动就用大棍、扁担、粗绳、软鞭乱打，打得小孩遍体是伤；出口就骂“野仔”、“杂种仔”、“不准吃”、“打死你”。孩子被打骂得不敢亲近父母。但是，孩子并没能管教好，相反地是更顽皮。
    经过这次贯彻婚姻法运动，父母们认识到对子女必须好好保护，好好抚养和教育，后悔过去打骂小孩的不对。二月三日晚上，小南路后街召开了一个母亲座谈会。一个母亲沉痛地说：“我在一九四七年生第一个小孩，才四十天，小孩因有病常哭，一个深夜里哭得特别厉害，邻人都厌烦了。当时丈夫又不接济，生活很困难，忍不住了，性急上来就一巴掌打在孩子的脸上。天快亮时，摸摸孩子的头，冷了，脚也冷了，他死了（痛哭）。我的小孩若不死，今年七岁了，可以去读书啦！解放后，我还经常打骂孩子，用软鞭打孩子的脚，有一次还打出血来。经过这次学习后，我知道了自己的错误，决心改变自己的坏脾气，细心地用比好比坏、比长比短的方法教育子女。”钱玉英的脾气也不好，也经常打骂子女，有一次打得女儿眼青面肿，还有一次用粗桶绳打，又一次要女儿伏着用扁担打，打得她饭不敢吃饱，菜也不敢挟，挟菜时还偷看妈妈的眼睛。但每次打过不几天，孩子又顽皮起来了。她说：“其实并不是孩子顽皮，是自己不耐心教育的结果。今后我保证要耐心地好好地教育孩子，使他们都敢亲近我。”
    涂春英是个好妈妈，她在会上发言时，先指出了打骂孩子的害处，并批判了“棒头出好仔”的错误思想，然后说出她教育子女的方法。她说：“我的孩子今年十四岁，读中学啦！我从来没有打骂过他，一向耐心地教育他，一次教不来第二次又教；我也不大声恐吓他。这样，他很喜欢亲近我，也很听我的话。”并且，她认为教好子女，使子女长大了能好好地为人民服务，是妈妈的责任和光荣。慈祥和蔼的胡妈，对子女的教养也很耐心，不打骂，也不吓唬，孩子们都很亲近她、体贴她。她是这样教育孩子的：“我先教好第一个之后，其他的就由他带领，所以个个都很好，也很聪明。我一共有八个子女，五个参加工作了，还有三个正在学校读书。”
    谈到这里，大家都感觉很愉快，热烈地讨论教育子女的方法，都愿意向胡妈和涂春英学习，并保证今后爱护子女。
    这以后，人们走进小南路后街，再也听不到父母的怒骂声和孩子的哭喊声了。看到的是父母们在耐心地教育和鼓励孩子，孩子也乖顺地回答。钱玉英那十三岁的女儿，打破了一个盆子，起初不敢承认，很怕妈妈打；但经过学习后的钱玉英这次不但没有打她，反而很温柔地说：“打烂了不要紧，以后要小心些，没有那么多钱买啊！”女儿乖乖地认了错，难过地说：“妈！我以后小心。”事实教育了钱玉英，也教育了很多父母们：教育孩子决不能采取粗暴的态度。
