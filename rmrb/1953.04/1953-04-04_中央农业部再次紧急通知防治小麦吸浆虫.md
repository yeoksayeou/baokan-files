The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture issued another emergency notice on March 31 regarding the prevention and control of wheat midges. The notice pointed out: According to inspections in various regions, the area and density of wheat midge infestations indicate a rather serious threat. Currently, the overwintering larvae of the wheat midge are gradually rising and are about to pupate and emerge from the soil. Wheat midges are a devastating pest to wheat production, and emergency measures must be taken to actively prevent and control them to ensure a good wheat harvest this year.

The notice requires: 1. All areas where wheat midges occur should establish temporary pest control headquarters at each level, vigorously mobilize the masses of farmers, and universally implement net-dragging methods for eradication. 2. In areas with suitable conditions, focus on applying 0.5% "666" pesticide powder for control; and attention should be paid to technical guidance to fully utilize the effectiveness of pesticides and machinery. 3. The agricultural and forestry departments of the provincial people's governments in areas where wheat midges occur should quickly guide and assist the masses of farmers in resolving the difficulties of pest control materials (such as thin net cloth for dragging and "666" pesticide powder). 4. Establish a strict intelligence system. Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and other provinces should promptly report to higher levels before and during the emergence of adult wheat midges. 5. Agricultural leading institutions at all levels should immediately dispatch strong inspection teams to go deep into wheat midge-infested areas to inspect, promote, and summarize experiences at any time to guide the pest control campaign. In addition, red spiders and aphids are also severely damaging many wheat-producing areas, and farmers should be organized to conduct reconnaissance and take effective prevention and control measures to curb the spread of pests.

    中央农业部再次紧急通知防治小麦吸浆虫
    中央人民政府农业部在三月三十一日再次发出关于防治小麦吸浆虫的紧急通知。通知指出：据各地检查，潜藏有小麦吸浆虫的面积和密度说明虫害威胁相当严重。目前小麦吸浆虫过冬幼虫已逐渐上升，即将羽化出土。而小麦吸浆虫是小麦生产上的毁灭性害虫，必须采取紧急措施积极进行防治，以保证今年小麦丰收。
    通知要求：一、凡发生小麦吸浆虫的地区，应逐级成立临时性的治虫指挥部，大力发动农民群众，普遍推行拉网办法，进行扑灭。二、有条件地区，可重点施用百分之零点五的“六六六”药粉除治；并应重视技术指导，充分发挥药械效能。三、发生小麦吸浆虫地区的各省人民政府农林厅，应迅速指导和帮助农民群众解决治虫物质（如拉网稀布及“六六六”药粉等）的困难。四、建立严格的情报制度，河南、陕西、安徽、四川、江苏等省在小麦吸浆虫成虫羽化前及成虫发生期间，应及时向上逐级汇报。五、各级农业领导机构应即派出强有力的检查小组，深入小麦吸浆虫发生地区检查、推动，并随时总结经验，指导治虫运动。此外，红蜘蛛及蚜虫，在不少产麦地区为害也很严重，亦应组织农民群众进行侦察，采取有效防治办法，制止虫害蔓延。（新华社）
