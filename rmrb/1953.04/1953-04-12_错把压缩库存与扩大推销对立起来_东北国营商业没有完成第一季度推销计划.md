Title: Mistakenly Opposing Inventory Reduction with Expanding Sales: Northeast State-Owned Commerce Fails to Complete First Quarter Sales Plan

Northeast State-Owned Commerce's first quarter sales plan was only 88.2% fulfilled. The main reason for the failure to complete the sales plan was that, in the process of implementing the economic accounting system, state-owned commercial enterprises in various parts of Northeast China did not improve their business management with the spirit of actively expanding sales and ensuring supply. Instead, they passively reduced their responsibility for supporting production and supplying the market, opposing the acceleration of capital turnover to the expansion of sales and guaranteeing market supply, and opposing inventory liquidation and reduction to actively organizing sources of goods. As a result, although some inventory reduction problems were solved, the first quarter in-region procurement plan was only about 60% completed, and the out-of-region procurement plan was only half completed. This led to a serious situation of continuous reduction in commodity varieties and out-of-stock situations, and the sales plan could not be completed. For example, state-owned department stores in various parts of Songjiang Province generally reduced 1,000 kinds of commodities; in individual areas (such as Yichun Department Store), the number of commodities even dropped from 5,000 to 580; the largest state-owned retail store in Northeast China - Shenyang State-Owned Trade Joint Company - also reduced 2,700 kinds of commodities. In Mudanjiang Department Store, commodities such as soap, men's socks, Kosilin and Blue Shirt Cloth were out of stock for more than a month, and bleached earth cloth was out of stock for a quarter. The company sold at least 2 billion yuan less in the first quarter.

Northeast State-Owned Commerce procured less goods, but production departments had more stockpiled products. In the first quarter, only 20% of the department store commodities produced by state-owned light industry and local state-owned industry in the Northeast region were ordered by state-owned commerce. Therefore, many production departments had to set up their own sales offices, with 43 such offices in Shenyang alone. Because there was no unified organization to manage them, the phenomenon of inconsistent market prices was formed. For example, the self-sale price of paper from production departments was generally 15.2% to 70% lower than the state-owned commercial price, and enamelware was 5% to 21.4% lower than the price. This created a chaotic market situation.

Because the Northeast Commercial Bureau and various specialized district companies did not fully understand the new problems arising from the change of the administrative region organization and the implementation of the economic accounting system, and the business of all parties had not yet been properly connected, they hastily changed the district company organization and revoked the Tianjin and Shanghai offices. This created a situation where no one was responsible for procurement and sales. The wholesale plans of state-owned commerce and cooperative societies were not coordinated. The cooperative system did not know how many commodities it purchased on its own and how many it purchased from state-owned commerce. The goods wholesale by state-owned commerce to cooperative societies decreased by more than 1.5 trillion yuan in the first quarter. The Northeast Commercial Bureau and the commercial departments (bureaus) of each province (city) remained focused on reorganizing their organizations and holding meetings for a long time, and failed to promptly check and correct the deviations that occurred in the operation of state-owned commerce. The current phenomenon of excessive inventory of goods in Northeast State-Owned Commerce is mainly due to a small number of unsalable varieties, such as rubber shoes and sacks in the department store system, but there is a lack of necessary reserves for varieties needed in the summer. The business departments did not specifically study this actual situation, but only generally called for inventory reduction, which caused a misperception of inventory reduction below. In addition, the Northeast Commercial Bureau did not handle the regional price differences between inside and outside the customs and the wholesale and retail price differences reasonably in adjusting commercial work. Therefore, the sales of state-owned commerce in the western part of Liaoxi Province and the southern part of Rehe Province, which are close to North China, were greatly affected. The first quarter sales plan of Rehe Province was only 69.1% completed.

In response to the problems existing in the first quarter of the Northeast State-Owned Commerce's work, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee instructed the Northeast Commercial Bureau to seriously examine and summarize the reasons for the failure to complete the plan in the first quarter in terms of ideology, policy, and work style in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on anti-bureaucracy and the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's commercial work conference documents, and to find solutions. In the second quarter, state-owned commerce and cooperative societies should emphasize expanding sales and ensuring market supply, and conscientiously guarantee the completion of the commodity circulation plan, and implement the economic accounting system to the grass-roots units in a step-by-step manner. At the same time, the tasks not completed in the first quarter must be appropriately compensated for in the second quarter to ensure that 42% to 45% of the annual plan is completed in the first half of the year.

### 错把压缩库存与扩大推销对立起来  东北国营商业没有完成第一季度推销计划

    错把压缩库存与扩大推销对立起来
    东北国营商业没有完成第一季度推销计划
    东北国营商业第一季度的推销计划仅完成了百分之八十八点二。没有完成推销计划的主要原因，是东北各地国营商业在实行经济核算制过程中，不是以积极扩大推销、保证供应的精神改善经营管理，而是消极地减轻对扶植生产和供应市场的责任，把加速资金周转与扩大推销、保证市场供应对立起来，把清产核资压缩库存与积极组织货源对立起来。因此，虽然解决了部分库存的压缩问题，但第一季度区内进货计划仅完成百分之六十左右，区外进货计划只完成一半，结果，造成商品品种不断减少和脱销的严重情况，推销计划不能完成。譬如：松江省各地国营百货公司普遍减少了一千种商品；个别地区（如伊春百货公司）的商品竟由五千种下降到五百八十种；东北最大的国营零售商店——沈阳市国营贸易联营公司的商品，也减少了二千七百种。牡丹江市百货公司肥皂、男短袜、靠士林和蓝士林布等商品脱销了一个多月，漂白土布等商品竟脱销了一个季度，该公司第一季度至少少卖二十亿元。
    东北国营商业进货少了，生产部门积压的产品却多了。第一季度东北地区的国营轻工业和地方国营工业的百货类商品，只有百分之二十由国营商业订货。因此，很多生产部门只得自设推销处，只沈阳一地就设了四十三处。由于没有一个统一的机构进行管理，形成市场价格不一的现象。如纸张，生产部门自销价格普遍低于国营商业牌价百分之十五点二到百分之七十，搪瓷低于牌价百分之五到百分之二十一点四。这样就造成了市场的混乱状态。
    由于东北商业管理局和各专业区公司对大行政区机构改变和贯彻实行经济核算制以后所产生的新问题认识不足，和各方面的业务还没有衔接好，就草率地改变了区公司机构和撤销了天津、上海办事处，这就造成了采购和推销无人负责的现象。国营商业与合作社批发计划不衔接，合作社系统自购多少商品和向国营商业批购多少商品，都摸不着底，国营商业批发给合作社的货，第一季度减少了一万五千亿元以上。东北商业管理局与各省（市）商业厅（局）长期停留在整编机构和开会上，对国营商业在经营中发生的偏差未能及时加以检查纠正。当前东北国营商业库存商品过大的现象，主要是不适销的少数品种，如百货系统的胶鞋、麻袋等，但对夏季需要的品种却缺乏必要的储备量。业务部门没有具体研究这种实际情况，只一般号召压缩库存，因此引起下面对压缩库存的错觉。另外，东北商业管理局在调整商业工作中，对关内外的地区差价及对批发和零售差价处理得不尽合理，因而接近华北地区的辽西省西部和热河省南部，国营商业的推销受了很大影响。热河省第一季度的推销计划只完成了百分之六十九点一。
    针对东北国营商业第一季度工作中存在的问题，中共中央东北局指示东北商业管理局，根据中央反官僚主义指示的精神与东北局商业工作会议文件的精神，在思想上、政策上、作风上认真检查与总结第一季度未完成计划的原因，找出解决的办法。第二季度国营商业与合作社应强调扩大推销，保证市场供应，在切实保证完成商品流转计划中，有步骤地将经济核算制贯彻到基层单位去，同时必须将第一季度未完成的任务，争取在第二季度适当加以弥补，保证上半年内完成全年计划的百分之四十二—四十五。
