The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" 1953, Issue 15, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The People of Capitalist Countries Strengthen the Struggle for Democratic Freedom." The editorial points out that in capitalist countries, communist and democratic parties are resolutely and valiantly leading the people forward in the struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence. In this struggle, communists are ardent fighters striving for and tirelessly building the unity of the broad masses of the people. They particularly and forcefully point out that in the struggle for democratic freedom, it is not only necessary to unite workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, clerks, and intellectuals, but also to unite those patriotic elements of the bourgeoisie who are increasingly aware of the rule of foreign imperialists and can participate in the struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace.

Important articles in this issue include: "Comrade Stalin's Immortal Theory is a Weapon for Further Strengthening the Party and the National Front" by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "The Victory of the Leninist-Stalinist National Policy" by Viliam Široký, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; and "The Italian People's Struggle for Democratic Freedom" by Mauro Scoccimarro, a leader of the Italian Communist Party.

Široký's article discusses Comrade Stalin's enormous theoretical and practical contributions to the national question. Široký points out that the principles of the national policy formulated by Stalin integrate the proletariat's struggle for socialism with the oppressed nations' struggle for freedom and independence into a common struggle against imperialism. The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution opened up new prospects for oppressed nations. After the victory of the October Revolution, the revolutionary working class in capitalist countries and colonies/semi-colonies, in its struggle against imperialism, could rely not only on the brilliant works of Lenin and Stalin, but also on the outstanding example of the fraternal cooperation of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, realized under the guidance of the Leninist-Stalinist national policy. The fraternal and friendly relations between all countries in the socialist camp clearly demonstrate the invincibility and vibrant power of Stalin's policy and Stalin's theory. Now, the flames of national liberation struggles have engulfed the countries of the Near East and the Far East. Communist and democratic parties in capitalist countries, responding to the call made by Comrade Stalin at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are raising the banner of national independence and democratic freedom even higher. Imperialists can never suppress the will of the people of all countries to strive for freedom and peace.

Scoccimarro's article analyzes the domestic political situation in Italy, pointing out that in the past five years, the people's movement led by the Italian Communist Party has achieved great development. Despite the reactionary government of the Italian Christian Democratic Party's frantic attacks on the people's movement, attempting to undermine its unity and force it to retreat, the people's movement is stronger than ever. The municipal elections of 1952 showed that the ruling party's policies had completely failed. In order to find new means of opposing the people's movement, the reactionary leading group of the Christian Democratic Party used deceptive means of so-called electoral law "reform" to limit the number of representatives of opposition parties in parliament, thereby formulating a number of anti-democratic laws that have already been drafted and amending the constitution to undermine the rights of the people. The article emphasizes that the power of the people and democracy will block the path of reactionary forces. The communists, socialists, and independent left-wing democrats of Italy are now standing together in parliament and throughout the country, and will continue to do so in the upcoming parliamentary election campaign, to fight against the reactionary ruling party.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十五期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十五期已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“资本主义国家的人民加强争取民主自由的斗争”的社论。社论指出：在资本主义国家里，共产主义的和民主的政党正在坚决地、英勇地领导着为和平、自由和民族独立而斗争的人民前进。共产主义者在这种斗争中是热忱地争取和不倦地建立广大人民团结的战士。他们特别有力地指出，在争取民主自由的斗争中，不仅必须团结工人、农民、手工业者、职员和知识分子，还要团结那些愈来愈感觉到外国帝国主义者的统治并能参加争取民族独立、民主与和平的斗争的资产阶级爱国分子。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席波·贝鲁特的“斯大林同志的不朽学说是进一步加强党和全国阵线的武器”，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团委员威·西罗基的“列宁—斯大林民族政策的胜利”，意大利共产党领导人之一莫·斯科奇马罗的“意大利人民为民主自由而斗争”。
    西罗基在文章中论述了斯大林同志在理论上和实践上对于民族问题的巨大贡献。西罗基指出：斯大林所制定的民族政策的原则，把无产阶级争取社会主义的斗争和被压迫民族争取自由和独立的斗争融合为一个共同反对帝国主义的斗争。伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利给被压迫民族打开了新的远景。十月革命胜利以后，资本主义国家和殖民地半殖民地的革命工人阶级，在反对帝国主义的斗争中，不仅能够依靠列宁和斯大林的天才著作，而且能够依靠在列宁、斯大林民族政策指导下实现的苏联各族人民兄弟般合作的卓越榜样。社会主义阵营所有国家间的兄弟般的友好关系，清楚地证明了斯大林政策和斯大林学说的不可战胜性和生气蓬勃的力量。现在，民族解放斗争的火焰已经笼罩了近东和远东的国家。资本主义国家的共产主义的和民主的政党，响应斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上发出的号召，正把民族独立和民主自由的旗帜更高地举起来。帝国主义者是决不能抑止各国人民争取自由与和平的意志的。
    斯科奇马罗的文章分析了意大利的国内政治局势，他指出过去五年中，以意大利共产党为首的人民运动获得了很大发展。尽管意大利天主教民主党反动政府疯狂地进攻人民运动，企图破坏它的团结，迫使它后退，但是，人民运动比过去更加强大。一九五二年的市选就表明执政党的政策已经彻底失败。为了找寻反对人民运动的新手段，天主教民主党反动领导集团就用所谓选举法“改革”的欺骗手段，来限制反对党派在议会中的代表人数，从而制定若干已经拟就的反民主法律，并修改宪法，以摧残人民的权利。文章强调说，但是人民的、民主的力量将挡住反动势力的去路。意大利的共产党人、社会党人和独立左翼民主派分子，现在已经在议会里和全国各地，而且还要在即将举行的议会选举运动中，站在一起，和反动的执政党进行斗争。
    本期还在“政治箚记”栏中刊载了扬·马莱克的题为“在缅甸的国民党匪帮”一文。（新华社）
