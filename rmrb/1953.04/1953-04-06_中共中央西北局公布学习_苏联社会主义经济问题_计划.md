    CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau Announces Plan for Studying "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR"
    On April 1, the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau announced a plan to study Stalin's "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." In order to commemorate the great teacher Comrade Stalin, the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau has decided to use this work as a 1953 textbook for senior party cadres in the Northwest Region who have reading ability. It requires that every party cadre participating in the study treat this study as an important part of party life, concentrating on, systematically, and conscientiously studying it, to lay the foundation for future studies of Marxism-Leninism and Stalinism. The study time is set for seven months, from April to November. The plan also stipulates many reference materials.
    In order to effectively complete this study plan, the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau stipulates that local party committees must directly lead this study, and the general district agency party committees and the party committees of each province and city should organize core groups to strengthen the leadership of the general groups. The leader of the core group should be a main responsible cadre of the party committee; at the same time, the collective study system of twice a week, three hours each time, must be conscientiously implemented.

    中共中央西北局公布学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”计划
    中共中央西北局在四月一日公布了学习斯大林所著“苏联社会主义经济问题”的计划。为着纪念伟大的导师斯大林同志，中共中央西北局决定将这部著作作为西北区具有阅读能力的党员高级干部的一九五三年的学习课本，要求每个参加学习的党员干部都把这一次学习当作党的生活的重要部分，集中地、系统地、认真地进行学习，为今后继续学习马克思列宁主义和斯大林学说奠定基础。学习时间规定为七个月，即从四月份起到十一月为止。计划中还规定了许多参考材料。
    为了有效地完成这一学习计划，中共中央西北局规定：各地党委必须直接领导这一学习，大区机关党委和各省、市党委都应组织核心组，以加强对一般小组的领导，核心组小组长应由党委主要负责干部担任；同时，必须认真执行每周二次、每次三小时的集体学习制度。（新华社）
