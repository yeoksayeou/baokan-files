The CCP Wuxiang Dongzhuang Village Branch, Shanxi Province, only focused on establishing an agricultural producers' cooperative and neglected the leadership of mutual aid teams, which adversely affected the production of most farmers in the village.

This village has more than sixty households, with three mutual aid teams. Last autumn, the county committee approved the establishment of one cooperative. The village party branch adopted a comprehensive mobilization approach, drawing twenty-five households with high political awareness and strong labor from the three teams to establish the cooperative. All seven party members and five members of the Communist Youth League in the village, except for one party member, joined the cooperative. For the farmers who did not join the cooperative, the party branch forcibly gathered twenty-four of them into a large group; in addition, eleven individual households were left. From then on, the party branch relaxed its leadership over the mutual aid teams, not to mention the production of individual farmers. The party branch's abandonment of leading the masses' production resulted in poor production performance for both mutual aid teams and individual farmers. Until now, they only had about 30 loads of manure per mu, and one-third of the autumn land had not been harrowed. If this continues, 68 percent of the village's land belonging to mutual aid teams and individual farmers will not be able to increase production.

Recently, the party branch has recognized the harm of "emphasizing the cooperative and neglecting the group." It has decided to rectify the mutual aid teams according to the principle of voluntarism, abolish the originally formed large group, and allow the masses to voluntarily combine into small groups. At the same time, four party and CYL members were sent from the cooperative to specifically help the mutual aid teams with rectification. It was also decided that some meetings of the agricultural producers' cooperative should include representatives from the mutual aid teams, or organize them to visit the cooperative's production work to exchange experiences and improve the production of the mutual aid teams. (Editor's note: The party branch should also help individual farmers who have not joined the groups or cooperatives to solve their production problems and help them improve their production.)

    中共武乡东庄村支部纠正“重社轻组”偏向
    中共山西武乡县东庄村支部只顾建立农业生产合作社，放弃领导互助组，使全村大部农民的生产受到不利的影响。
    这村共六十多户，有三个互助组；去年秋后县委批准建一个社。该村党支部采用了全面发动的办法，抽出三个组中政治觉悟高、劳力强的二十五户建立了社。全村七个党员和五个团员，除一个党员以外，全部入了社。对于未入社的农户，党支部把其中的二十四户硬凑到一块，编成一个大组；此外，还留下十一家单干户。从此以后，党支部就放松了对互助组的领导，对单干户的生产就更不用说了。党支部放弃领导群众的生产，结果互助组、单干农民的生产成绩很差。直到现在他们每亩地才有粪三十担左右，十分之三的秋地没有耢过。照这样下去，全村属于互助组和单干农民的百分之六十八的土地，就不能增产了。
    最近，党支部已认识了“重社轻组”的危害性；决定按照自愿原则整顿互助组，取消原来编制的大组，让群众自愿结合为小组。同时，从社内派出四个党、团员具体帮助互助组进行整顿；又确定农业生产合作社的一些会议，要吸收互助组代表参加，或组织他们参观社的生产工作，借以交流经验，提高互助组的生产。（编者按：对未参加组、社的单干农民，党支部也应帮助他们解决生产上的问题，帮助他们把生产搞好。）
