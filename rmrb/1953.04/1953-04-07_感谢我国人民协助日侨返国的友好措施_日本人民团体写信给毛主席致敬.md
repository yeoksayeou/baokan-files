Editor's Note: Japanese democratic organizations and peace-loving people have written letters to Chairman Mao Zedong, expressing their heartfelt gratitude to China for its friendly measures in assisting Japanese nationals who wish to return home. They unanimously stated that they would strengthen the friendship and unity between the Chinese people and the peace-loving Japanese people, and smash the conspiracies of the anti-China, anti-peace, US-Japanese reactionaries to sow discord and expand aggressive war. The following are excerpts from the letters received.

Letter from the Japan-China Friendship Association to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong:

We are very happy to be able to entrust a delegation to bring this letter to you.

The magnanimity of the Chinese people under your leadership, who, through the Chinese Red Cross, assisted Japanese nationals in China to return home collectively, has once again deeply moved the Japanese people.

For a long time, the reactionary Japanese government, in order to instill hostility towards you in the minds of the Japanese people, has carried out all kinds of malicious propaganda, such as spreading rumors that our nationals residing in your country were “detained” by you, forced to work, and suffered unbearable pain. They ignored your country's repeated calls for the conclusion of a reasonable and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, blocked all avenues for adjusting diplomatic relations by peaceful means, and prohibited civilian peace envoys from going to your country. It is this Japanese government that should be held responsible for obstructing the collective return of Japanese nationals. However, they shifted this responsibility to your government and engaged in malicious propaganda. This practice is truly despicable and outrageous.

However, now the time for right and wrong is clear. The experiences of the large number of returning nationals will shatter the various rumors about your country one after another. We deeply express our gratitude for the internationalist spirit of you and the people of your country, who have long treated Japanese nationals equally and without any racial discrimination, giving them all a way to live and enabling them to freely develop their talents and lead meaningful lives.

The Japan-China Friendship Association is very honored to be able to jointly dispatch a delegation with the Japanese Red Cross and the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee to participate in the national delegation to discuss the issue of Japanese nationals returning home. Japan-China friendship is the widespread desire of the Japanese people, and the mission entrusted to our association by the cause of striving for Asian and world peace is also important. Although the association has encountered various difficulties in the three years since its establishment (such as in 1951 when the US occupying forces arrested four staff members including the secretary-general of our association for distributing your country's "People's Daily" and sentenced them to hard labor), the work of the association has been smoothly carried out thanks to the constantly developing Japan-China friendship movement of the Japanese people and the China-Japan trade agreement, which has received the deep friendship and support of your government and people. This is demonstrated by the increasingly widespread and enthusiastic Japan-China Friendship Movement centered on the National Day of your country on October 1st every year. During last year's Japan-China Friendship Month, in addition to thousands of people participating in your country's founding celebration in Tokyo and Osaka, grand celebrations were held throughout the country from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south, either holding up your giant statue and the five-star flag, or showing the film "The White-Haired Girl", or holding concerts of "The Yellow River Cantata". This demonstrates the boundless love of the Japanese people for you and the people of your country. This collective return of nationals residing in your country will strengthen this movement, and the scale of this year's Friendship Month will be even grander.

The conspiracy of the reactionaries to undermine Japan-China friendship and Asian peace is becoming increasingly sinister. However, the growing friendship between the people of Japan and China and the achievements of your country's great peaceful construction's first five-year plan will completely shatter these conspiracies. We wholeheartedly salute you—the great leader of peace and friendship—and wish you good health!

Letter from the Japan National Relief Association to Chairman Mao

To Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

The Japanese people wholeheartedly welcome the talk on the issue of Japanese nationals in China broadcast by the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station on December 1, 1952.

The Yoshida government of Japan has always engaged in malicious propaganda against your country on the issue of Japanese nationals returning home, without conducting sincere negotiations, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the families of nationals who long to return home.

Now, thanks to the notification from the Chinese Red Cross, a delegation composed of three organizations, the Japanese Red Cross, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association, will soon visit your country to discuss the specific procedures for assisting Japanese nationals to return home. In this way, I think that Japanese nationals in China will soon return home healthy and happily.

We believe that Japanese nationals in China have been able to live peaceful and happy lives for the past seven years since the war, even though they are far from their homeland, which is primarily due to your concern. At the same time, the experience gained by Japanese nationals in China from participating in the construction of the New China under your leadership will make a great contribution to the construction of a democratic Japan.

Now, as Japanese nationals in China are about to return home, we sincerely thank you for your concern for all Japanese nationals in China.

Fuse Tatsuji, Central Chairman of the Japan National Relief Association
December 28, 1952

Letter from the Japan Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong:

On behalf of the Japanese working class, we sincerely thank the people's organizations of your country under your leadership for their statement on assisting Japanese nationals in China who wish to return home. This is exciting not only for the Japanese nationals themselves and their families, but also for the entire Japanese people.

We once again sincerely apologize to the Chinese people. The Chinese people suffered massacre for a long time under the aggression of Japanese imperialism, cities, villages, homes and properties were burned down, and they suffered the pain of cruel suppression and plunder.

Now, the Japanese reactionaries are trying to revive militarism again, stepping up the rearmament, and attempting to make Japanese youth serve as cannon fodder for US imperialism.

Respected Comrade Mao Zedong, we Japanese working class swear: Not only will we never fight against the Chinese people, but we will closely unite with the Chinese people and drive the common enemy - the US imperialists - out of Asia.

We are confident that because of this repatriation of Japanese nationals, the unity of the people of Japan and China will be further strengthened. No force can destroy the unity of these two nations.

Watanabe Michio, Japan Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions
Tokyo, January 26, 1953

Letter from the Japan Farmers' Union to Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao Zedong:

We thank the great spirit of the Chinese people under your leadership for helping Japanese nationals in China return home.

We are deeply sorry that when the warlords under the Japanese Emperor system invaded your country and caused suffering to your people, those Japanese farmers who were deprived of their land and freedom were forced to serve as Manchurian and Mongolian pioneers or participate in the war, which destroyed your country's peace and prosperity.

Now, the Yoshida government has forgotten the greatest damage and moral responsibility to your country, and has revived militarism again; not only does it not conclude a fair peace treaty, but it acts as a lackey of US imperialism, prohibits free political, economic, and cultural exchanges with the New China, and adopts a hostile attitude towards the New China. The Yoshida government forces farmers to accept colonial low rice prices, organizes industrial development youth teams, and reorganizes farmers' groups, etc., attempting to make farmers serve as cannon fodder for the anti-communist crusade. This is a complete insult to the desire of us Japanese farmers to live in peace and maintain friendship with your country.

Despite this, we Japanese people fully understand the Chinese people's friendly assistance to Japanese nationals, as well as the good intentions of inviting Japanese people to participate in peace conferences and discuss trade. As Japanese nationals return home, this will become even clearer.

Although diplomatic relations between the governments are not normal, we sincerely thank the Chinese people for promoting the return of Japanese nationals in China through popular organizations trusted by the Japanese people.

The Japan Farmers' Union is honored to be able to express its respects to you on behalf of Japanese farmers who are striving for peace and national independence.

Kubota Yutaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japan Farmers' Union

Letter from Kihara Toshiaki, a worker at the Kawasaki Ironworks in Japan, to Chairman Mao

Comrade Mao Zedong:

I presume to write directly to you as a Japanese worker, which is really because infinite gratitude makes me unable to resist doing so.

When I learned of the news from China that a delegation would be sent to discuss assisting Japanese nationals in China to return home, I felt unspeakably happy.

Having learned about the great face of China from books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", "New Children's Heroes", "Fighting China" by Simonov, and the movie "The White-Haired Girl", I really don't know how to respond to this profound hand of friendship extended by the Chinese people this time. I bravely answer you: I want to fight for the peace of Japan and the world, even if it means breaking my bones to pieces.

The factory where I work is the Kawasaki Ironworks of Japan Steel Pipe Corporation, which is one of the three major monopoly capitals of the Japanese steel industry.

Last year, under the pretext of so-called streamlining personnel, the factory forced an increase in labor intensity that was more than twice as high as in the past. In transportation, steel bars, and electrical departments, more than twelve hours of work has already been implemented, which is even more than during wartime. At the end of last year, the company notified that bathing time should be outside of working hours, but this was opposed by everyone, forcing the union (controlled by labor traitors) to negotiate for cancellation. Now we are still able to continue bathing during working hours.

At the end of last year, the workers' movement continued to develop by leaps and bounds on the basis of the struggles of the coal miners' union and the electrical workers' union. We are now also fighting for an increase of 3,000 yen in the average wage, and we are determined to carry it through to the end. Today, our branch sewed twenty-nine consolation bags for the coal miners' union, which will be sent soon.

The warmongers have increased our living burden. From January, train tickets have increased in price, and water, gas, and other prices will continue to rise.

The American aggressors and the Yoshida traitorous government are forcing us to suffer the pain of World War II again. But we will no longer be fooled by them.

In our neighborhood, there are great friends - China and the Soviet Union. For the Japanese people, this is an unprecedentedly good condition. Japanese workers will bravely carry out a tenacious struggle for peace. Finally, let me thank the friendship of great China.

Kihara Toshiaki, Kawasaki Ironworks

    感谢我国人民协助日侨返国的友好措施
    日本人民团体写信给毛主席致敬
    编者按：日本的民主团体和爱好和平人民纷纷写信给毛泽东主席，衷心地感谢中国协助愿意回国的日侨返回日本的友好措施。他们一致表示，要加强中国人民和爱好和平的日本人民之间的友谊和团结，粉碎美、日反动派进行挑拨离间和扩大侵略战争的阴谋。下面发表的就是来信中的一部分。
    日本中国友好协会致毛主席信敬爱的毛泽东主席：
    我们能够委托代表团带上这封信给您，感到很高兴。
    您领导下的中国人民通过中国红十字会协助在华日侨集体回国，这个盛情再一次使日本国民万分感激。
    很久以来，日本反动政府为了向日本国民灌输对您的敌意，曾经进行了各种各样的恶毒宣传，如造谣说侨居贵国的我国侨民为您“扣留”、强迫劳动、不堪痛苦，便是其中最恶劣的一种。他们不理贵国早就再三呼吁缔结合理的对日全面和约，而堵塞了一切用和平的手段来调整邦交的途径，并且禁止民间的和平使节前往贵国，正是这个日本政府应该负阻碍日本侨民集体回国的责任。它却把这个责任转推给贵国政府，进行恶意宣传。这种作法真是卑鄙恶劣透顶了。
    可是，现在，是非黑白分明的时候来到了。将来大批回国侨民的旅居见闻必将一个接着一个地粉碎关于贵国的各种谣言。对于您和贵国人民长期以来毫无种族歧视地、一视同仁地给予日本侨民以生路，使他们都能自由地发挥所长，过着有意义的生活的国际主义精神，我们深深表示感谢。
    日本中国友好协会这次能够与日本红十字会、日本和平联络委员会共同派遣代表参加洽商日侨回国问题的国民代表团，感到非常光荣。日、中友好是我国国民广泛的愿望，争取亚洲及世界和平事业所赋予我们协会的使命也是重大的。协会成立以来三年间虽曾碰到各种困难（如一九五一年美国占领军曾以发行贵国的“人民日报”为由，逮捕了我协会事务局长以下四个工作人员，并被判处苦役），可是由于不断发展的日本国民的日中友好运动和中日贸易协定，获得贵国政府和人民的深厚的友情的支持，使协会的工作顺利展开。以每年十月一日贵国国庆日为中心的日中友好运动一年比一年广泛而热烈，就证明了这一点。去年的日中友好月，除了东京、大阪两地各有数千人参加贵国建国庆祝大会外，在北至北海道、南至九州的全国各地，或高举着您的巨像与五星旗，或放映“白毛女”影片，或举行“黄河大合唱”的演唱会来进行盛大的庆祝，这都表现了日本国民对您和贵国人民的无限热爱。这次居留贵国侨民的集体回国，将加强这个运动，今年的友好月的规模必将更加盛大。
    反动派企图破坏日中友好与亚洲和平的阴谋越来越险恶。但是，日中两国人民日益增涨的友谊与贵国伟大和平建设的第一个五年计划的成就，必将完全粉碎这些阴谋。我们衷心地向您——伟大的和平与友好的领导者致敬，并祝健康！
                                    日本中国友好协会
                                    一九五三年一月二十四日
    日本国民救援会致毛主席信中华人民共和国主席毛泽东先生：
    日本国民由衷地欢迎一九五二年十二月一日北京的人民广播电台所播送的关于在华日侨问题的谈话。
    日本的吉田政府，在有关在华日侨回国的问题上，一向只是对贵国进行恶意的宣传，而不进行诚意的交涉，曾引起了渴望回国的侨民的家属们的不满。
    现在，由于中国红十字会的通知，日本红十字会、日本和平联络委员会和日中友好协会三团体组成了代表团，近日即将访问贵国，具体洽商协助日侨回国手续问题。这样，我想在华的日侨不久就会健康、愉快地回国了。
    我们认为在华日侨战后七年来，虽然远离故乡而仍能过着和平愉快的生活，这首先是由于您的关怀。同时，在华日侨因参加您所领导的新中国建设工作而获得的经验，对于建设民主的日本，将有很大的贡献。
    现在，正当在华日侨即将回国之际，我们衷心地感谢您对全体在华日侨的关怀。

                                    一九五二年十二月二十八日
    世界工会联合会日本联络事务局致毛主席信敬爱的毛泽东主席：
    我们代表日本的工人阶级，衷心地感谢您领导下的贵国人民团体关于协助在华日侨中希望回国者返国的声明。这不仅是日侨本身及其家属，而且也是全体日本国民感到兴奋的。
    我们再一次衷心地向中国人民表示谢罪。中国人民曾长期在日本帝国主义侵略下遭受了残杀，都市、乡村、家园和财产被烧毁，并饱受残酷的镇压和掠夺的痛苦。
    现在，日本反动派又要重新复活军国主义，加紧重整军备，企图使日本的青年充当美帝国主义的炮灰。
    敬爱的毛泽东同志，我们日本的工人阶级宣誓：不仅决不与中国人民作战，而且要和中国人民紧密地团结起来，把共同的敌人——美帝国主义者驱逐出亚洲。
    我们确信：由于这次日侨回国，将进一步加强日中两国人民的团结。无论什么力量也不能破坏这两个民族的团结。

                            一九五三年一月二十六日于东京
    日本农民组合致毛主席信毛泽东主席：
    我们感谢您领导下的中国人民援助在华日侨回国的伟大精神。
    我们万分抱歉，当日本天皇制度下的军阀侵略贵国，使贵国人民遭受痛苦时，那些被夺去土地和自由的日本农民，被迫充当满蒙开拓义勇军，或者参加了战争，曾经破坏贵国的和平与繁荣。
    现在，吉田政府竟忘记了给与贵国的最大损害与道义上的责任，又重新复活军国主义；不仅不缔结公正的和约，而且充当美帝国主义者的奴才，禁止与新中国进行政治、经济和文化的自由交流，并对新中国采取敌对的态度。吉田政府强迫农民接受殖民地的低廉米价，组织产业开发青年队和重新整编农民团体等，企图使农民充当反共十字军的炮灰。这是完全侮辱了我们日本农民愿与贵国和平相处与保持友好的意愿的。
    尽管如此，中国人民对日侨的充满着友情的协助，以及几次邀请日本人民参加和平会议和洽商贸易的好意，我们日本人民是完全了解的。随着日侨的回国，这将更加清楚了。
    尽管政府之间的国交是不正常的，但是我们衷心地感谢中国人民通过为日本国民所信赖的民众团体而促进在华日侨的回国。
    日本农民组合能够代表为争取和平与民族独立的日本农民向您致意，很感光荣。
            日本农民组合中央委员会主席久保田丰

    日本川崎制铁所工人木原敏昭致毛主席信毛泽东同志：
    我冒昧地以一个日本工人的身份直接给您写信，这实在是由于无限的感激使我禁不住要这样做。
    当得知从中国通知派遣代表团洽商协助在华日侨回国的消息时，我感到说不出的高兴。
    从“毛泽东选集”、“新儿女英雄传”、西蒙诺夫著的“战斗的中国”等书里和“白毛女”电影中了解了伟大的中国面貌的我，对于这次中国人民伸出的深厚的友谊之手真是不知应如何回答才好。
    友好的中国把日中友好协会、日本和平联络委员会和爱好和平的我们日本人民——作为谈判的对象，还有什么比这更可令人高兴的呢？我勇敢地回答您：我要为日本与世界的和平，不惜粉身碎骨地进行斗争。
    我工作的工厂是日本钢管公司的川崎制铁所，它是日本钢铁工业三大独占资本之一。
    去年，厂方在所谓精简人员的名义下，强迫提高了比过去高出两倍以上的劳动强度，在运输、钢条和电气等部门，已经实行比战时还要多的十二小时的劳动。去年年底，公司通知要把洗澡时间放在工作时间之外，但遭到大家的反对，使工会（工贼分子把持的）不得不进行交涉要求取消，现在我们仍然得以继续在工作时间内洗澡。
    去年年底，工人运动在煤矿工会和电气工会的斗争基础上，继续大踏步的发展。我们现在也正在要求增加平均工资三千日元的斗争，并坚决进行到底。今天，我们支部给煤矿工会缝制了二十九个慰问袋，近日即将送去。
    战争贩子加重了我们的生活负担。从一月起，火车票加价了，自来水、煤气费用和其他物价也将继之上涨。
    美国侵略者和吉田卖国政府正强迫我们再次遭受第二次世界大战时的痛苦。但是我们再也不受他们的骗了。
    在我们的近邻，有着伟大的朋友——中国和苏联，对日本国民来说，这是历史上从未有过的良好条件。日本工人将勇敢地为了和平而进行顽强的斗争。最后，让我感谢伟大中国的友谊。
