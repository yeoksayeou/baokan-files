The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 12, 1953, was published on the 4th.

This issue, commemorating the passing of the great leader and teacher of the world's working people, Stalin, publishes an editorial entitled "Stalin's Cause Lives Forever!" The editorial points out: The passing of Comrade Stalin has caused deep grief in the hearts of every honest worker, every progressive person who sincerely strives for international peace and friendship and hates war. In these days of grief, the people of the people's democratic countries are more closely united around the Soviet Union—the main pillar of their independence and security. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have taken a series of important measures to further strengthen the leadership of state and economic affairs. These measures embody the unity of the Communist Party, the government, and the Soviet people. The Soviet people are deeply convinced of their strength. They believe that the Soviet government, headed by the faithful students and comrades-in-arms of the great Stalin, will undoubtedly guarantee the implementation of the policies formulated by the Party and the government. The working people of the people's democratic countries and all progressive mankind have this confidence, just like the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. Stalin's cause, Stalin's thought lives forever!

This issue contains articles commemorating Comrade Stalin: "Stalin—Leader and Inspirer of the Struggle Against Fascism and Against War" by Luigi Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; "Stalin's Cause is Immortal!" by Władysław Gomułka, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; and "The Great Leader of the Working People" by Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India. They all discussed Comrade Stalin's great contributions to the contemporary era and emphasized the specific help and decisive role of his thoughts and doctrines in their various types of countries. They also unanimously expressed their determination to follow Comrade Stalin's instructions, more resolutely strengthen the unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, heighten vigilance, and victoriously advance the revolutionary cause.

This issue continues to publish condolences from Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries on the death of the great Stalin, as well as news and articles from working people around the world mourning Stalin.

This issue also publishes news about the fourth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held on March 15, as well as the full text of the speech by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at the meeting.

This issue published news about the death of Comrade Klement Gottwald, the beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people: the announcement of the Central Committe of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the Central Action Committee of the National Front to all working people of Czechoslovakia, the condolence telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the full text of the speeches by Viliam Široký and Antonín Zápotocký at the funeral and memorial service for Klement Gottwald held in Prague on March 19, and the speech by Nikolai Bulganin, head of the Soviet delegation attending Comrade Gottwald's funeral, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Marshal of the Soviet Union.

This issue commemorates the 70th anniversary of the death of Karl Marx, the founder of scientific communism and leader of the world proletariat, and publishes an article by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, entitled "Genius Teacher and Leader of the International Proletariat" and an article entitled "The Invincible Power of Scientific Communism."

Pieck's article pointed out: Marx, together with Engels, proved for the first time that socialism is not a concoction of utopians, but the inevitable result of the development of capitalist society. They proved that capitalism is bound to perish and be replaced by a new socialist society with no exploitation of man by man. Their contribution was that they showed the proletariat of the world its own role, its own task, its own mission—to rise up in revolutionary struggle against capitalism and in this struggle to unite all laborers and exploited people around itself. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has declared 1953 as "Karl Marx Memorial Year." The primary task of the memorial year is to make the German people understand the world historical significance of the cause of this great son of the German nation, and to educate the working masses with the uncompromising spirit of struggle to achieve the socialist system. The German working class is strengthening the deepest and closest friendship with the socialist Soviet Union, which has already realized Marx's doctrine, and today they are fighting to ensure that socialism becomes a reality in Marx's homeland—Germany.

The article commemorating the 70th anniversary of Marx's death discusses the communist theory of Marx and Engels and the contributions of Lenin and Stalin to the treasure house of Marxist theory. The article points out: The reason why Marxism is omnipotent is that it is correct. Marxism is already the battle banner of hundreds of millions of people. Marxist thought has become a powerful material force for transforming the world. No force in the world can stop the victorious advance of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin thought. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十二期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第十二期已在四日出版。
    本期为纪念全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林逝世，发表题为“斯大林的事业永垂不朽！”的社论。社论指出：斯大林同志的逝世，在每一个正直的工人的心中，在每一个诚心争取国际和平友好和痛恨战争的进步人士的心中引起了深切的悲痛。在这些悲痛的日子里，人民民主国家的人民更加紧密地团结在苏联——他们的独立和安全的主要支柱——的周围。苏联共产党中央委员会、苏维埃政府和苏联最高苏维埃，采取了一系列的重要措施以进一步加强国家和经济事务的领导。这些措施体现了共产党、政府和苏维埃人民的团结一致。苏联人民深信自己的力量。他们相信以伟大的斯大林的忠实学生和战友为首的苏联政府，毫无疑问地能保证实现党和政府所制订的政策。人民民主国家的劳动人民和全体进步人类都像苏联各族人民一样有着这种信心。斯大林的事业，斯大林的思想永垂不朽！
    本期刊载的悼念斯大林同志的文章有：意大利共产党副总书记路·隆哥的“斯大林——反法西斯主义和反战争的斗争的领导者和鼓舞者”，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员弗·约兹维亚克的“斯大林的事业不朽！”，印度共产党总书记阿·高士的“劳动人民的伟大领袖”。他们都论述了斯大林同志对当代的伟大贡献，并着重指出他的思想和学说对他们各个不同类型国家的具体帮助和所起的决定性作用。他们还一致表示要遵循斯大林同志的指示，更加坚决地加强以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的团结、提高警惕并把革命事业胜利地推向前进。
    本期继续刊载了各国共产党和工人党悼念伟大斯大林的唁电和全世界劳动人民悼念斯大林的消息和文章。
    本期还刊载了关于苏联最高苏维埃三月十五日举行第四次会议的消息，以及苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在会上的发言全文。
    本期发表了关于捷克斯洛伐克人民敬爱的领袖克·哥特瓦尔德同志逝世的消息：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府、民族阵线中央行动委员会告捷克斯洛伐克全体劳动人民的公告，苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的唁电，三月十九日在布拉格举行的克·哥特瓦尔德丧礼和追悼大会上威·西罗基同志和安·萨波托斯基同志以及苏联参加哥特瓦尔德同志丧礼代表团团长、苏联部长会议第一副主席、苏联元帅尼·布尔加宁三人讲话的全文。
    本期为纪念科学共产主义的创始人、世界无产阶级的领袖卡尔·马克思逝世七十周年，刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会主席威廉·皮克的题为“国际无产阶级的天才导师和领袖”的文章和一篇题为“科学的共产主义的无敌力量” 的论文。
    皮克的文章指出：马克思同恩格斯一道，第一次证明了社会主义并不是空想家的杜撰，而是资本主义社会发展的必然结果。他们证明了资本主义必然灭亡并将为一个新的、没有人剥削人的现象的社会主义社会所代替。他们的贡献是他们向全世界的无产阶级显示了它自己的作用、自己的任务、自己的使命——起来向资本主义进行革命斗争，并在这个斗争中把一切劳苦者和被剥削者团结在自己的周围。德国统一社会党中央委员会已经宣布一九五三年为“卡尔·马克思纪念年”。纪念年的首要任务是要使德国人民了解德意志民族的这个伟大儿子的事业的世界历史意义，并以争取实现社会主义社会制度的不妥协的斗争精神来教育劳动群众。德国工人阶级正在加强与已经实现了马克思学说的社会主义苏联的最深厚、最密切的友谊，他们今天正在为保证社会主义在马克思的祖国——德国成为现实而斗争。
    纪念马克思逝世七十周年的论文中论述了马克思和恩格斯的共产主义学说以及列宁和斯大林对马克思主义理论宝库的贡献。论文指出：马克思主义学说之所以万能，就是因为它正确。马克思主义已是亿万人民战斗的旗帜。马克思主义思想已经成为一种强有力的改造世界的物质力量。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林思想的胜利前进。　（新华社）
