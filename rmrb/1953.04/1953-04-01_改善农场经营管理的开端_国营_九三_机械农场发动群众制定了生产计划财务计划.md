The Beginning of Improving Farm Management
——The State-owned "September 3rd" Mechanical Farm Mobilizes the Masses to Formulate Production and Financial Plans
Ding Luxu

After the merger of the state-owned "September 3rd" Mechanical Farm and the former Heilongjiang Yilahha Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Farm, it became a large-scale mechanized farm operating 14,699 hectares (each hectare equals 15 mu) of land. For the three years since the establishment of this farm, it has consistently failed to fulfill the production tasks assigned by the state. Although last year's output increased somewhat compared to the previous two years, the costs remained high and waste was substantial. The reasons for this phenomenon are: First, the farm cadres lacked the idea of relying on all employees to run the farm well. Their leadership style was undemocratic, and they lacked political and ideological education for the employees, resulting in serious bureaucratic practices that alienated them from the masses and reality. The farm's production and financial plans were only formulated through discussions among a small number of leading comrades and some business department cadres, without mobilizing the masses for discussion and research. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses could not be brought into play. Second, the leading cadres had not learned the management methods of socialist enterprises. For example, in 1950, the farm blindly expanded the area of wasteland reclamation by 10,000 hectares, but ended up abandoning it due to a lack of resources. In the spring of 1952, the Third Work Area forcibly sowed 200 hectares of soybeans after the sowing season had passed, resulting in the inability to mature in the autumn and a 70 percent reduction in yield. A clear responsibility system was not established, and no one was responsible for work and production. Cultivation was rough, and yields were low. The farm's staff frequently changed, and no one was responsible for the assets, resulting in substantial waste.

Last autumn, after the leading comrades of the state-owned "September 3rd" Mechanical Farm participated in the farm work conference convened by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, they began to realize that there were serious problems within the farm, but they did not know where to start to solve them. It was not until last winter when the farm conducted party rectification that the farm's leading comrades clearly recognized the above-mentioned problems based on the employees' self-criticisms and exposures. Only then did they resolve to rely on the masses to implement scientific socialist enterprise management methods and overcome the phenomena of blind production and lack of responsibility. At this time, the farm headquarters organized a research team, led by the farm director himself, to go deep into the employee masses to listen to their opinions.

The most important opinions raised by the production team employees were two points: First, it is imperative to implement a dedicated responsibility system. The cultivated land should be divided into dedicated areas, equipped with certain agricultural machinery. Tractor drivers should "marry" their tractors, with dedicated machines and dedicated personnel responsible for cultivation from beginning to end. Second, it is imperative to ensure that all farm employees clearly understand their production tasks, control their own production plans, and clarify their goals.

The research team led everyone to discuss the specific methods of dedicated areas, dedicated responsibility, and comprehensive contracting. Finally, it was determined that each crop rotation area (dedicated area) would be 900 to 1,200 hectares (implementing a five-year crop rotation system), and each "Natzi" or ("Det-54") tractor would be responsible for cultivating 250 hectares of land.

Through this in-depth investigation, the farm leadership grasped the basic materials and believed that to implement a dedicated area responsibility system and prepare a good financial plan, it was necessary to first rectify the labor organization. Therefore, the strength of the sixteen production teams was reallocated, and the land was re-divided. It was decided that each production team would be equipped with an average of four medium-sized tractors, with four people assigned to each tractor; each production team would be equipped with two carts; and according to different operation conditions, car teams and repair shops suitable for the operation would be equipped. Indirect production personnel and farm headquarters personnel were also comprehensively adjusted and streamlined. After the labor organization was rectified, the personnel, horses, and carts required for the same cultivation tasks were greatly reduced compared to the past (personnel decreased by 33.8 percent, horses decreased by 67.6 percent, and carts decreased by 60 percent); therefore, the farm's cultivated area increased by 45.4 percent compared to the past. This rectification also revealed that the farm had accumulated a large number of tractors and other agricultural machinery in the past. The annual expenditure for these surplus personnel, machinery, and horses was 3.5 billion yuan, which was a serious waste. This rectification eliminated such a huge waste and transferred these potentials to other production departments and basic construction departments, enabling them to play a significant role.

After rectifying the labor organization, the farm's appearance basically changed. However, in order to prepare a good mass production plan and financial plan, it was still necessary to set correct production operation quotas. Whether the quota is reasonable is a key to preparing a good plan. If the quota is too high, workers will not have the confidence to complete the plan; if the quota is too low, workers will not be motivated. In short, without a correct quota, it is impossible to formulate a correct plan. In order to formulate correct production operation quotas, the farm headquarters organized many working groups to go deep into the various production teams and locomotive groups to conduct in-depth discussions with tractor drivers, combine operators, and personnel from all aspects. From their practical work experience, they put forward preliminary opinions on the fuel consumption, intermediate maintenance, material consumption, personnel quotas, and work quotas of various mechanical operations. Based on the preliminary quotas proposed by the masses, combined with the superior's indicators and regulations, the farm leadership held a professional conference to discuss the quotas. More detailed and prudent research was conducted on various quotas, especially yield quotas. When studying yield quotas, various agricultural technical conditions were considered from various aspects.

After the quotas were announced, the employees had no concerns about the regulations on the quantity, quality, and raw material consumption of various operations. Because everyone had touched a certain standard in the three years of operation, the currently stipulated operation quotas only concentrated the experience gained by everyone in the long-term experience. However, some people expressed doubts about the regulations on output. The main reason was that the output had not been as high as stipulated in the past three years. Why was the output so low in the past? In addition to the rough tillage work, the main reason was that the number of plants grown was insufficient, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings was serious. Originally, it was required that 5 million wheat plants should grow per hectare, but at the time of harvest, many were less than 4 million plants. In order to eliminate the doubts of the masses, combined with learning from Zhaoyuan's experience in high yield, the number of crops was specifically calculated, and it was found that in the wheat fields in 1952, more than 70 hectares of land were wasted due to missed sowing and missing seedlings. In order to ensure full seedlings, everyone was determined to strengthen their sense of responsibility, do a good job in germination tests, calculate the seeding amount according to the germination rate, scientifically determine the loss rate of seedlings in the field, improve the quality of operations, and ensure the growth and development of crops in order to increase yields.

Once the quotas were determined and the masses' thinking was clarified, the plan was formulated from the grassroots level. There are five work areas in the entire farm, and each work area organized an accounting group as the core of formulating the plan. The accounting group and the production team members together studied the land conditions of each plot, formulated a cultivation plan according to the land conditions, and stipulated the planned yield. Finally, around the crop cultivation plan, according to the quotas, a series of plans for mechanical operations, manual operations, transportation, repair and maintenance, and material supply were formulated. A work schedule was drawn up for the operation of each tractor; a clear transportation task was also set for each car.

After the production team completed the production plan, they immediately formulated a cost plan based on the accounting materials and quotas.

With such a detailed and precise grassroots plan, the work area and farm headquarters combined it, plus the plans of the auxiliary production departments and management production departments, and formulated the entire farm's detailed production and financial plan. After rectifying the labor organization and formulating the production and financial plan, the cost of grain was greatly reduced from the calculation of the planned cost. The actual cost of wheat in 1952 was reduced by 34.3 percent, and the cost of soybeans was reduced by 42 percent.

Formulating a plan is only the beginning of the work, and the more important thing is how to implement it. To this end, the farm established a comprehensive statistical network, with one professional statistician assigned to each production team, and one accounting group set up in each work area, including a cost accountant, a planner, and a statistician. The responsibility of the work area accounting group is to calculate and analyze according to the statistical reports of the statisticians, timely raise questions, and supervise the implementation of the plan. In this way, every locomotive and every tractor driver in the production team can know their plan implementation at any time and grasp their direction of struggle at any time. In order to closely combine the revolutionary interests with the personal interests of the employees, the farm leadership also decided to implement an excess reward system.

After implementing these reforms, the state-owned September 3rd Mechanical Farm greatly improved its management and operation, increased the enthusiasm of all employees for production, and a production competition campaign is underway.

    改善农场经营管理的开端
    ——国营“九三”机械农场发动群众制定了生产计划财务计划
    丁履枢
    国营“九三”机械农场和原黑龙江伊拉哈革命残废军人农场合并以后，成为一个经营一万四千六百九十九垧（每垧合十五市亩）土地的大规模机械化农场。这个农场成立三年以来，始终没有很好地完成国家交给的生产任务。去年的产量虽然比前两年提高了些，但成本仍然很高，浪费很大。造成这种现象的原因是：第一、农场干部缺乏依靠全体职工办好农场的思想，领导作风不民主，对职工群众缺乏政治、思想教育，存在着严重的脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风。场的生产财务计划只是由少数领导同志和一些业务部门的干部商议制订，没有发动群众讨论研究。因此，群众的积极性不能发挥。第二、领导干部没有学会社会主义企业的经营管理方法。例如，一九五○年农场盲目扩大开荒面积一万垧，结果照顾不过来白白丢下了。一九五二年春季，播种时期已过，第三作业区还强播二百垧大豆，结果秋后不能成熟，减产百分之七十。没有建立明确的责任制，工作、生产无人负责。耕作粗糙，产量不高。场里工作人员经常流动，资产无人负责，浪费很大。
    去年秋天，国营“九三”机械农场的领导同志参加了中共中央东北局召开的农场工作会议后，开始意识到场内存在着严重的问题，但当时还不知道要从什么地方着手解决。直到去年冬天农场进行整党时，农场领导同志根据职工们的检讨和揭发，明确地认识到以上的问题，这才决心依靠群众实行科学的社会主义企业的经营管理方法，克服盲目生产、无人负责的现象。这时场部组织了一个调查研究小组，由场长亲自领导，深入到职工群众中去听取群众意见。
    生产队的职工们提出的意见，最主要的有两点：第一、一定要实行专责制。在耕作的土地上，要划成专区，配备一定的机械农具。拖拉机手要和拖拉机“结婚”，专机专人，包耕到底。第二、一定要使全场职工都明确地了解自己的生产任务，由自己掌握自己的生产计划，明确自己的奋斗目标。
    调查研究小组领导大家展开了对于专区专责一包到底的具体办法的讨论。最后确定：每一轮作区（专区）为九百垧至一千二百垧（实行五年轮作制），每台“纳齐”或（“德特—五四”）拖拉机，担负二百五十垧地的耕作任务。
    经过这一次深入调查，农场领导方面掌握了基本材料，认为要实行专区专责制，作好财务计划，首先应该整顿劳动组织。于是把十六个生产队的力量重新作了配备，把土地重新作了区划。决定每一生产队平均配备四台中型拖拉机，每台拖拉机配备四人；每一生产队配备大车两台；根据不同的作业情况，配备适合于作业应用的汽车队、修理所；间接生产人员、场部机关人员也作了全面的调整和紧缩。劳动组织整顿以后，同样耕作任务所需的人员、马匹、大车等却比过去大大减少了（人员减少百分之三三·八，马匹减少百分之六七·六，大车减少百分之六十）；因此，农场的耕地面积比过去扩大了百分之四五·四。经过这次整顿，还发现农场过去积压了大批的拖拉机和其他机械农具，对于这些多余的人员、机械和马匹，过去每年要开支三十五亿元，这是一个严重的浪费。经过这次整顿，消灭了这样庞大的浪费，把这些潜力输送到其他生产部门和基本建设部门，使它们能够发挥重大的作用。
    整顿了劳动组织，农场的面貌基本上改变了。但是，为了作好群众性的生产计划和财务计划，还必须把正确的生产作业定额定出来。定额是否合理是作好计划的一个关键。定额高了，工人没有信心完成计划；定额低了，工人劲头又不会高。总之，没有正确的定额，就不可能制定出正确的计划。为了制定正确的生产作业定额，场部组织了许多工作小组，深入到各个生产队、机车组中，和拖拉机手、联合机手及各方面的人员进行深入的讨论。大家从实际的工作体验中，对于各种机械作业的耗油量、中修保养、材料消耗、人员定额及工作定额等等，都提出了初步的意见。农场领导方面根据群众提出的初步定额，结合着上级的指标、规定，举行了讨论定额的专业会议。对于各种定额，特别是产量定额，作了更加细致慎重的研究。在研究产量定额时，从多方面考虑了各种农作技术条件。
    定额公布后，职工对于各种作业数量、质量、原材料消耗等规定毫无顾虑。因为大家在三年来的作业中，都摸到了一定的标准，现在规定的作业定额，仅是集中了大家在长期体验中得到的经验而已。但对于产量的规定，有些人却表示怀疑。主要是过去三年来产量没有规定的这么高。为什么过去的产量很低？除了整地工作粗糙以外，最主要的原因是作物生育的株数不够，缺苗现象严重。本来要求每垧小麦成长五百万株的，结果收割时很多不足四百万株。为了消除群众的怀疑，结合学习肇源的丰产经验，具体计算作物的棵数，结果发现在一九五二年的小麦地里，由于漏播、缺苗，白白扔掉了七十多垧地。为了保证全苗，大家都决心加强责任心，作好发芽试验，根据发芽率计算播种量，科学地确定田间株苗的损失率，提高作业质量，保证作物的生长发育，以便提高产量。
    定额确定了，群众的思想打通了，就从基层开始制定计划。全场共有五个作业区，每一作业区组织了核算组，作为制定计划的核心。核算组和生产队员在一起，研究每一块地的土地情况，根据土地情况去制定耕作计划，规定计划产量。最后围绕着作物的耕作计划，根据定额，制定了机械作业、人力作业、运输、修理保养、物资供应等一系列的计划。对于每一台拖拉机的作业，都排出了工作日程；对于每一台汽车，也订出了明确的运输任务。
    生产队作完生产计划，紧接着根据核算的材料和定额，就制定了成本计划。
    有了这样细致精密的基层计划，作业区、场部把它汇合起来，再加上辅助生产部门、管理生产部门的计划，就制定出全场的、精密的、生产财务计划了。经过整顿劳动组织、制定生产财务计划以后，从计划成本的核算上，表现出谷物成本大为降低，小麦比一九五二年的实际成本降低了百分之三四·三，大豆降低了百分之四二。
    计划制定了，才只是工作的开始，更重要的还是如何贯彻执行的问题。为此，农场建立了全面的统计网，每一生产队配备了专业统计员一人，每一作业区设一核算组，包括成本会计、计划、统计人员各一人。作业区核算组的责任是根据统计员的统计报告，加以核算分析，及时提出问题，监督着计划的执行。这样，生产队的每一台机车，每一个拖拉机手，都可以随时知道自己的计划执行情况，随时掌握着自己的奋斗方向。为了使革命利益与职工的个人利益紧紧结合，农场领导方面并决定实行超额奖励制度。
    国营九三机械农场在实行了这样一些改革后，大大地改进了经营管理工作，提高了全场职工的生产积极性，生产竞赛运动正在展开。
