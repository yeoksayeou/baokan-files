Ministry of Heavy Industry Deploys Full Year's Work

[This Newspaper's News] Since November of last year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government has dispatched a large number of cadres to inspect the capital construction and production conditions of its affiliated factories and mines. Then, in response to the shortcomings and problems discovered during the inspection, it conducted analysis and research, and proposed the work guidelines, work steps, and specific solutions for 1953. Subsequently, at the end of February, it convened a meeting of production factory and mine directors, and in mid-March, it convened a meeting of capital construction factory and mine directors, engineering company managers, and construction site directors. Further research and discussion were conducted at these two meetings. Finally, the full year's work plan for 1953 was determined, and instructions were issued to all affiliated enterprises.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry's instructions first assessed the work status of various factories and mines in 1952. The instructions pointed out that in 1952, the total output value of factories and mines affiliated with the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed 118% of the plan. Costs were reduced by 9.4% (calculated only for North China and Northeast China). The turnover period of working capital was greatly shortened. Labor productivity increased by 28.3%. The quality of major products was significantly improved. Many important advanced experiences and model figures emerged in various factories and mines. In terms of capital construction, large-scale and technically complex engineering construction was carried out while learning. Parallel and continuous operation methods in civil engineering and machinery installation were studied and implemented, greatly shortening the construction and installation period. Professional construction organizations, design institutions, and geological institutions were established, accumulating experience and training cadres, laying a preliminary foundation for future capital construction.

The instructions then pointed out that the task for 1953 is: to increase total output value by 23.4% compared to 1952, reduce costs by 8.73%, increase labor productivity by 14.7%, and shorten the working capital turnover period from 126 days last year to 120 days. The investment in capital construction is equivalent to 160% of last year's capital construction investment. Many of the planned engineering projects are large-scale and technically complex, similar to the Anshan large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant. Therefore, this year's task is very arduous. To complete this arduous task, it is necessary to fully recognize the following shortcomings, errors, and problems in the current work and find appropriate solutions.

Main shortcomings and problems in capital construction:

(1) Tendencies of recklessness and departmentalism. When formulating the annual capital construction plan, the leading cadres of many factories and mines often failed to realistically calculate subjective and objective conditions (design capabilities, construction forces, equipment ordering possibilities, resource conditions, technical capabilities, power sources, etc.). They included many engineering projects that were obviously impossible to complete in the plan, and requested higher authorities to approve some secondary, deferrable, or even unnecessary projects. This caused the capital construction plan to deviate from reality, resulting in a large number of projects that should have been completed each year failing to be completed, accumulating national funds, and often affecting the normal production of other departments due to the failure of a major project to be completed on schedule. As a result, the plan lost its guiding and controlling role, and at the end of the year, secondary projects were often overfulfilled while major projects could not be completed.

(2) Errors in design thinking and insufficient design personnel. In the past, the factories and mines under the Ministry of Heavy Industry lacked political work and ideological transformation work for the technical personnel in design institutions. Therefore, bourgeois viewpoints, technical conservatism, and even resistance to advanced Soviet technology still existed quite commonly among technical personnel. The erroneous design of the Tongguanshan Smelter is a typical example. Although design institutions for Anshan, non-ferrous metals, chemical industry, and civil engineering were established last year, there was still a lack of sufficient technical personnel, especially a lack of design personnel who could work independently. At the same time, there was a lack of understanding of the resource situation necessary for many designs. In this case, even if design was reluctantly carried out, there would inevitably be many errors, affecting the progress of the project.

(3) Poor engineering quality. In recent years, except for a few particularly important projects where quality was ensured due to timely attention, most projects have experienced quality defects of varying degrees.

(4) The phenomenon of waste and lack of accountability is alarming. Due to the failure to establish a system of specific personnel responsible for specific tasks in various construction organizations, or the unsoundness of the established system of specific responsibilities, and the failure to timely educate employees with a high degree of responsibility for national construction to do their job well, all kinds of serious waste phenomena occurred in complex work. Such as waste of raw materials, waste of labor, waste of machinery and equipment, waste of transportation, waste of power, waste caused by improper storage, waste caused by conservative quotas, waste caused by rework due to poor quality, etc.

(5) Violation of financial management system. Some factories and mines incorporated engineering investment into production costs due to insufficient capital construction investment, and some (such as the Shijingshan Engineering Company) even used advance payments for capital construction to purchase sofas.

Main shortcomings and problems in production:

(1) Conservative thinking in formulating production plans and uneven phenomena in the implementation of plans. When formulating production plans, factories and mines often overestimate production consumption quotas and underestimate equipment capacity, labor efficiency, recovery rates, etc. This reduces national income and wastes a large amount of national wealth. For example, the utilization coefficient, operating rate, and smelting time of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 8 open-hearth furnace are all planned to be lower this year than last year. The planned labor productivity of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is 17.5% lower than last year. Although the leadership has constantly struggled against this phenomenon and has specifically corrected such errors, due to the extremely incomplete accumulation of experience in formulating plans and the lack of complete investigation and systematic material accumulation for the actual quotas of most products, it is impossible to thoroughly expose the "conservative" phenomena in the plans of various factories and mines. Even if it can be pointed out, there is a lack of persuasive power.

In the implementation of the plan, most factories and mines cannot complete the plan on a daily basis at the beginning of the month, and rush at the end of the month; they cannot complete the plan in the first two months of each quarter, and rush in the last month; they use secondary products to make up for the total output value when major products cannot be completed; backward factories and mines and backward workshops cannot complete the plan, and rely on the excess of better factories and mines to make up for the total output value of the entire heavy industry. This uneven phenomenon, on the one hand, shows that the equipment utilization rate of many factories and mines and many months is very low, and the capacity of enterprises has not been fully utilized; on the other hand, it will inevitably lead to overtime, increased waste rates, damaged equipment, and increased accidents.

(2) The phenomenon of poor product quality exists universally and in large quantities. The product quality of many factories and mines fluctuates from month to month, and the waste rate fluctuates. Some factories and mines also lowered the quality inspection standards, so many products that actually did not meet the quality standards left the factory in the name of meeting the standards.

(3) Major casualties and equipment damage accidents continue to occur. In the past, although many responsible persons for causing accidents were punished, the punishment was too lenient. At the same time, there was a lack of more effective measures to avoid the occurrence of accidents, so that many factories and mines still held a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to technical security work.

(4) Weak economic accounting concepts and chaotic cost and financial management. The problems in cost management can be summarized as follows: formulating cost plans with conservative thinking, raising consumption quotas, so that the planned cost of some factories and mines is 20% to 30% higher than the actual cost; inaccurate material calculation, the "black materials" used in many products are not included in the cost, forming a cost reduction phenomenon; lax material requisition and return system, resulting in cost increases and decreases; using deferred amortization costs as a method to balance costs; increasing workshop management fees and transportation miscellaneous fees as an insurance method to reduce costs; increasing early costs to cover up conservative costs; violating discipline in cost management, etc. There is no management of fund quotas in financial management; the working capital plan has not become a financial indicator that enterprises must complete; a large amount of funds is stockpiled.

The above serious shortcomings in production management are closely linked to the phenomenon of lack of accountability in factories and mines. These shortcomings cause passivity and chaos in production management, and the phenomenon of lack of accountability in various tasks promotes the development of the above shortcomings and errors.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry's instructions pointed out that these main shortcomings and problems reflect the serious situation in capital construction and production, and also show that cadres' level of enterprise management is not high. The emergence of these shortcomings is due, on the one hand, to serious bureaucratic style in institutions at all levels, and on the other hand, it is inseparable from the ideological leadership level and organizational work of the ministry and various bureaus. Specifically, it is because the ministry and various bureaus cannot grasp typical examples for analysis, educate cadres to improve their ideological level; or because of lack of inspection; or because of lack of necessary struggle against serious errors; or because of failure to timely criticize the erroneous thoughts of technical personnel; or because organizational work cannot keep up with the requirements of the work.

Deployment of Work for 1953

The Ministry of Heavy Industry made the following deployment for the full year's work in 1953:

(1) Improve the planning work of capital construction. First, organize the planning departments of the ministry, bureaus, and relevant factories and mines to study and investigate the construction conditions of various new and expanded factories and mines in the Five-Year Plan (including resource burial, resource quality, resource coordination conditions, transportation conditions, power and water supply conditions, labor and population conditions, the technical strength and technical level that can be achieved in various places and factories and mines, the possibility of equipment supply, etc.). Study the problems that should be solved to do a good job in the specific engineering plan every year. Second, review various quotas of the Five-Year Plan (especially the equipment quotas, investment quotas, construction and installation quotas, labor quotas, and the types of technical personnel required for various factories and mines, and the recovery rate quotas, etc.). Only by understanding the basis of the plan can we accurately know the reliability of the plan. Third, study the annual progress arrangement and the various balances of annual workload of major projects, especially the engineering progress arrangement of steel mills and non-ferrous metal mines. Fourth, specifically criticize various incorrect planning schemes, especially criticizing the tendency of recklessness in the capital construction plan.

The purpose of the above tasks is to accumulate data, understand the situation, improve the business and ideological level of planning work, and establish a working foundation for the planning department; it is also to make the Five-Year Plan truly a driving force and a realistic plan.

(2) Survey and design work. Strengthening design institutions and improving the design level are prerequisites for realizing the Five-Year Plan and the annual plans. There are many complex problems in design work. This year, the first thing that needs to be solved is to reveal and criticize several major erroneous ideas that are common in design departments through typical examples, such as: lack of overall design thinking, no economic accounting concept, and local technical viewpoints; technical conservatism, lack of employee welfare viewpoints. At the same time, take the advanced Soviet design as a typical example to illustrate the correct design thinking. Second, make a summary of the review for each important design to gain experience and lessons to educate cadres and technical personnel and improve their design level. Third, establish and expand geological institutions and engineering geological institutions. Expand the geological departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Iron and Steel General Bureau, and the Non-ferrous Metals General Bureau by increasing and training new geological personnel, improving the original geological personnel, expanding the analysis and testing institutions, establishing surveying and mapping teams, equipping drilling and pitting equipment according to key areas, and organizing geological personnel to learn from Soviet experts. In terms of engineering geology, the main task is to train technical personnel who can make analytical conclusions on soil and hydrogeology and expand soil analysis and testing institutions. Fourth, establish five design centers for iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical industry, building materials industry, and civil engineering, and replenish the manpower of the design companies in these areas.

The purpose of the above tasks is to establish the foundation of design work ideologically and organizationally this year and prepare conditions for more arduous design work in the future.

(3) Capital construction construction work. First, from March to April, concentrate efforts to expose the alarming waste and lack of accountability in capital construction and carry out the movement to combat waste and establish a responsibility system (from material storage to individual responsibility on the construction site). Second, starting from May, concentrate efforts to carry out mass quality inspections, improve and consolidate technical management and technical responsibilities to ensure that all important projects this year fully meet quality standards. Third, strictly implement the economic accounting system in capital construction. Conduct economic accounting education on the basis of combating waste. Require that the main projects this year make design budgets and sign contracting contracts according to the design budgets; stipulate the cost reduction targets for each project; strictly implement financial supervision in accordance with the current national financial management methods for capital construction; ensure the completion of all projects on schedule. Fourth, summarize several of the most important and decisive advanced experiences and formulate steps and measures for promotion. The parallel and continuous operation method in civil engineering, the Su Changyou working method, pre-installation in installation engineering, and parallel installation are identified as advanced experiences that should be emphasized this year.

(4) Production. This year, do three main tasks well: First, from March to April, discuss this year's production plan in various factories and mines. After mass discussion, revise the main quotas of the enterprise in a guided manner; affirm the advanced experiences that can be promoted and formulate specific promotion methods; establish the original records of the workshop. After discussion, formulate workshop plans and team plans that guarantee to complete or overfulfill the national task in order to improve plan management. Second, from May to August, carry out the struggle against the phenomenon of lack of accountability and establish the responsibility system of various factories and mines (administrative responsibility system, technical responsibility system, production scheduling responsibility system, technical safety responsibility system, supply responsibility system, etc.) in order to ensure the balanced implementation of the production plan on the basis of the responsibility system and promote the improvement of cost, finance, and technical security work. Third, after August, carry out mass quality inspections, improve technical management (increase technical standards, technical operating procedures, carry out important technical reforms, and establish a quality responsibility system).

The instructions pointed out that although the work foundation of factories and mines in various places of the Ministry of Heavy Industry is somewhat different, there are shortcomings of varying degrees in the above three tasks. Therefore, except for factories and mines with special circumstances that can formulate different work steps, general factories and mines can follow the above unified steps. As for the financial cost problem in production, in addition to improving it in plan management, anti-waste and the establishment of a responsibility system, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on workshop economic accounting next year.

Finally, the instructions repeatedly emphasized that there are many aspects of confusion in the current enterprise management, and it is necessary to grasp several main tasks in a planned and step-by-step manner within a certain period to have a relatively in-depth understanding and a relatively thorough solution. As long as a few major things are done well in a month, a quarter, or a year, the work outlook will change. Therefore, from the ministry and bureaus to the factories and mines, we should concentrate our efforts this year to do the above work well and strive to complete the arduous and glorious tasks in capital construction and production.

    重工业部部署全年工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部从去年十一月开始，陆续派遣大批干部，检查了所属厂矿的基本建设情况和生产情况；然后针对检查中发现的缺点和问题，进行了分析研究，提出了一九五三年的工作方针、工作步骤和解决问题的具体办法；随后又在二月底召开了生产厂矿长会议，在三月中旬召开了基本建设厂矿长和工程公司经理、工地主任会议，在这两个会议上作了进一步的研究和讨论；最后确定了一九五三年的全年工作部署，并向所属各企业单位发布了指示。
    重工业部的指示首先估计了一九五二年各厂矿的工作状况。指示指出：一九五二年重工业部所属厂矿的生产总值完成了计划的百分之一百一十八；成本降低了百分之九·四（只就华北、东北计算）；流动资金周转期大大缩短；劳动生产率提高了百分之二十八·三；主要产品的质量有显著改进；各厂矿出现了很多重要的先进经验与模范人物。在基本建设方面，一边学习一边进行规模巨大、技术复杂的工程建设；学习和实施了土木建筑及机器安装中的平行流水作业方法，大大地缩短了建筑与安装的工期；建立了专业的施工组织、设计机构和地质机构，积累了经验，培养了干部，为今后基本建设打下了初步基础。
    指示接着指出一九五三年的任务是：生产总值比一九五二年提高百分之二十三·四，成本降低百分之八·七三，劳动生产率提高百分之一十四·七，流动资金的周转期由去年的一百二十六天缩短为一百二十天。基本建设的投资相当于去年基本建设投资百分之一百六十。计划进行的工程项目，类似鞍山大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂这样规模巨大、技术复杂的工程很多。因此，今年的任务是十分繁重的，而为完成这个繁重任务，就必须充分认识目前工作中的下列缺点、错误和问题；并找出适当的解决办法。
    基本建设方面的主要缺点和问题
    （一）冒进倾向和本位思想。每当制定年度的基本建设计划时，许多厂矿的领导干部，常常不去切实地计算主观与客观的条件（设计能力、施工力量、设备订购的可能、资源条件、技术能力、动力来源等等），就把许多显然不可能完成的工程项目列入计划，要求上级批准一些次要的、可以缓办的甚至不必要的工程。这就使基本建设计划离开了实际情况，使年年有大量应该完工的工程不能完工，积压国家资金，而且往往由于一项主要工程不能按期完工，影响其他部门的正常生产。结果计划失掉指导和控制作用，到年底常是次要的工程超额完成而主要的工程不能完成。
    （二）设计思想错误和设计人员不足。过去重工业部系统各厂矿，对于设计机构中的技术人员，缺乏政治工作与思想改造工作，因此，资产阶级观点、技术上的保守思想，甚至抗拒苏联先进技术的情绪，在技术人员中还相当普遍地存在；铜官山冶炼厂的错误设计就是典型例子之一。去年虽然建立了鞍山、有色金属、化学工业及土木建筑等设计机构，但还缺乏足够的技术人员，特别是缺乏能独立工作的设计人员。同时对于许多设计所必需的资源情况缺乏了解，在这种情况下，即使勉强进行了设计，也势必错误甚多，影响工程的进行。
    （三）工程质量不好。几年来，除少数特别重要的工程由于及时注意保证了质量外，多数工程都发生过或轻或重的质量低劣的情况。
    （四）浪费与无人负责的现象惊人。由于施工中的各种组织没有建立起专人专责制度，或者建立的专责制度不健全，以及没有及时教育职工以高度的对国家建设负责的精神，做好他们所担负的工作，在错综复杂的工作中，就产生了各色各样的严重的浪费现象。如原材料的浪费、劳动力的浪费、机械设备的浪费、运输的浪费、动力的浪费、保管不善造成的浪费、定额保守造成的浪费、质量低劣造成返工的浪费等等。
    （五）违犯财政管理制度。有的厂矿因为基本建设投资不足，将工程投资摊入生产成本，有的（如石景山工程公司）竟用基本建设预付款购置沙发。
    生产方面的主要缺点和问题
    （一）制定生产计划的保守思想和执行计划中的不均衡现象。制订生产计划时，各厂矿常常过高地计算生产消耗定额，过低地计算设备能力、劳动效率、回收率等等。这就降低了国家的收入并大量浪费了国家的资财。例如鞍钢八号平炉的利用系数、作业率和熔炼时间，今年计划中订的都比去年低。石景山钢铁厂劳动生产率的计划比去年降低百分之一十七·五。领导上虽然曾经不断地向这种现象进行斗争，并且曾经具体纠正过这类错误，但是，由于对制定计划的经验积累极不完全，对于多数产品的实际定额缺乏完整的调查和系统的材料积累，就无法彻底揭露各厂矿计划中的“保守”现象，即使能指出来，也缺乏说服力量。
    执行计划中，大多数厂矿都是月初不能按日完成计划，月终突击；每一季的头两个月完不成计划，最后一个月突击；主要产品完不成计划，用次要产品去弥补总产值；落后的厂矿和落后的车间不能完成计划，依靠较好厂矿的超额去弥补整个重工业的总产值。这种不均衡的现象，一方面说明许多厂矿和许多月份的设备运用率很低，没有充分发挥企业的能力；另一方面它又必然造成加班加点、增加废品率、损坏设备、事故增多的恶果。
    （二）普遍而大量地存在着产品质量不好的现象。许多厂矿各个月份的产品质量忽高忽低，废品率忽升忽降，极不稳定。有些厂矿还降低质量的检验标准，因而许多实际不合质量标准的产品，以合乎标准的名义出厂了。
    （三）重大伤亡事故与设备损伤事故不断地发生。过去对于造成事故的负责人员，虽然处分甚多，但处罚失之偏轻，同时缺乏更有效的措施以避免事故的发生，以致许多厂矿对于技术保安工作还抱着漠不关心的官僚主义态度。
    （四）经济核算观点薄弱，成本财务管理混乱。成本管理中的毛病可归纳为以下几种：以保守思想去制定成本计划，将消耗定额提高，因而部分厂矿的计划成本比实际成本高出百分之二十到百分之三十；材料计算不准，许多产品利用的“黑材料”不计在成本之内，形成成本虚降现象；领料退料制度不严，造成成本虚增虚降；把递延摊销的费用当做平衡成本的办法；提高车间管理费及运杂费，作为降低成本的保险办法；提高前期成本以掩盖保守的成本；在成本管理上违犯纪律等等。财务管理中没有资金定额的管理；流动资金计划没有成为企业必须完成的财务指标；资金大量积压。
    以上生产管理方面的严重缺点，是与厂矿中的无人负责现象密切联系着的。这些缺点造成了生产管理工作的被动和混乱，而各种工作中的无人负责现象，又助长着上述缺点与错误的发展。
    重工业部指示指出：这些主要缺点和问题反映了目前基本建设与生产方面的严重情况，也说明了干部管理企业的水平不高。这些缺点的产生，一方面是由于各级机构中有严重的官僚主义作风，另一方面又是与部和各局的思想领导水平与组织工作分不开的。具体说来，是由于部和各局不能抓住典型进行分析，教育干部提高干部的思想水平；或者是由于缺乏检查；或者是由于对于严重的错误缺乏必要的斗争；或者是由于对技术人员的错误思想没有及时批判；或者是由于组织工作跟不上工作的要求。
    一九五三年工作的部署
    对一九五三年全年工作，重工业部作了如下的部署：
    （一）改进基本建设的计划工作。第一，把部、局与有关厂矿的计划部门组织起来，研究与调查五年计划中各个新建及扩建厂矿的建设条件（包括资源埋藏、资源品质、资源的配合条件，交通运输条件、电源水力供应条件、劳动力与人口条件、各地及各厂矿可能达到的技术力量及技术水平、设备供应的可能等等）。研究应该努力解决的问题，以便做好每年具体的工程计划。第二，审核五年计划的各种定额（特别是关于各种厂矿的设备定额、投资定额、建筑安装中的定额、劳动定额、所需技术人员的类别、回收率的定额等等）。摸清楚计划中的根据，才能确切地知道计划的可靠程度。第三，研究主要工程逐年的进度排列与逐年工作量的各种平衡，特别是钢铁厂和有色金属厂矿的工程进度排列。第四，具体批判各种不正确的计划方案，特别是批判基本建设计划中的冒进倾向。
    以上几项工作的目的，是为了积累资料、摸透情况、提高计划工作的业务水平与思想水平，给计划部门建立工作基础；也是为了使五年计划真正成为鞭策的力量，而又是现实的计划。
    （二）勘查设计工作。壮大设计机构与提高设计水平，是实现五年计划及各年度计划的先决条件。设计工作中的问题繁多而复杂，今年首先需要解决的是通过典型，揭露与批判设计部门中普遍存在的几种主要的错误思想，如：缺乏总体设计思想，没有经济核算观点和局部的技术观点；技术上的保守思想，缺乏职工福利观点。同时以苏联先进的设计为典型，说明正确的设计思想。第二，对每一个重要设计都要做出审查的总结，从中取得经验教训，以教育干部与技术人员，提高他们的设计水平。第三，建立与扩大地质机构及工程地质机构。扩大鞍山钢铁公司、钢铁总局、有色金属总局的地质处，办法是增加和培养新的地质人员，提高原有地质人员，扩大分析化验的机构，建立测绘队，按重点地区配备钻探与坑探的设备，组织地质人员向苏联专家学习。工程地质方面，主要是训练能够对土壤与水文地质做分析结论的技术人员，扩大土壤分析化验机构。第四，建立钢铁、有色金属、化学工业、建筑材料工业及土木建筑等五个方面的设计中心机构，并充实这些方面的设计公司的人力。
    以上几项工作的目的，是为了在今年从思想上组织上确立设计工作的基础，为今后更加繁重的设计工作准备条件。
    （三）基本建设的施工工作。第一，三、四月份集中力量揭露基本建设中惊人的浪费现象和无人负责现象，进行反浪费与建立责任制运动（从材料保管到工地的个人专责制）。第二，从五月起集中力量进行群众性的质量检查，提高和巩固技术管理与技术方面的责任制，保证今年所有重要工程完全合乎质量标准。第三，严格执行基本建设中的经济核算制。在反浪费的基础上进行经济核算的教育。要求今年的主要工程都做出设计预算，根据设计预算订立包工合同；规定每项工程降低成本的指标；根据国家目前规定的基本建设财务管理办法，严格实行财务监督；保证按期完成所有工程。第四，总结几个最主要的有决定意义的先进经验，订出推广的步骤和办法。土木建筑中的平行流水作业方法、苏长有工作方法、安装工程中的预安装、平行安装，确定为今年应该着重推广的先进经验。
    （四）生产方面。今年办好三件主要工作：第一，三月至四月各厂矿中讨论今年生产计划。经过群众讨论，有领导地订正本企业的各种主要定额；把可以推广的先进经验加以肯定，定出推广的具体办法；把车间的原始记录建立起来。讨论之后，订出群众保证完成或超额完成国家任务的车间计划及班组计划，以便改进计划管理。第二，五月至八月进行反对无人负责现象的斗争，建立各厂矿的责任制度（行政上的专责制、技术责任制、生产调度责任制、技术安全责任制、供应责任制等等），以便在责任制的基础上保证均衡地执行生产计划，并促进成本财务及技术保安工作的改善。第三，八月后进行群众性的质量检查，提高技术管理（增订技术标准、技术操作规程，进行重要的技术改革和建立质量责任制）。
    指示指出：重工业部各地厂矿在生产方面的工作基础虽然有所不同，但是对于以上三项工作，都存在程度不同的缺点，因而除有特殊情况的厂矿可制定不同的工作步骤外，一般厂矿均可以依据上述统
    一步骤进行。至于生产中的财务成本问题，除在计划管理、反浪费和建立责任制中加以改进外，则需要在明年进行车间经济核算时集中力量进行。
    最后，指示反复强调指出：对于目前企业管理中存在着许多方面的混乱现象，需要有计划有步骤地在一定时期抓住几项主要工作，作比较深入的了解与比较彻底的解决。只要一个月、一季或一年中办好几件主要的事，工作面貌就会改变。因此，从部、局到厂矿，在今年内应集中力量做好以上工作，为完成基本建设与生产方面繁重而光荣的任务而奋斗。
