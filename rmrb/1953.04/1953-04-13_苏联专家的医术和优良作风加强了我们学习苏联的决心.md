Reader's Letters Summary

    The medical skills and excellent work style of Soviet experts
    strengthened our determination to learn from the Soviet Union.
    A letter from Liu Ruilin, a pediatrician at the First Hospital of Central Government Organs: Some time ago, a baby hospitalized in our hospital was in very critical condition. We tried all methods of treatment without success, so we called the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital to invite Soviet experts for consultation. We told them about the baby's critical condition over the phone, and the comrade who answered the phone immediately said, "As long as the Soviet experts have time, they will definitely go." And they asked for our phone number. Three minutes later, they called back and said: The Soviet experts have time to come to your hospital for consultation. We offered to send a car to pick them up immediately. They replied: "The Soviet experts have already left by car! You just need to send a comrade to wait at the entrance to bring the experts in!"
    Soon, Dubinina, a pediatrician expert from the Soviet Red Cross Hospital, who came to our hospital for consultation, arrived. Before getting out of the car, she asked about the baby's condition with concern. After getting out of the car, she rushed into the patient's room even more anxiously than the comrade leading the way. Then, she carefully examined the baby and gave us a lot of instructions for emergency treatment. At this time, Dr. Hu from the Children's Hospital was also invited for consultation (originally, we were afraid that the Soviet experts would not be available, so we also invited a doctor from the Children's Hospital at the same time). Dr. Hu thought that the Soviet expert had already finished the consultation, so it was not necessary for him to examine the patient again. However, the Soviet expert kindly and modestly insisted that Dr. Hu conduct an examination. During the discussion of the diagnosis and treatment, she constantly solicited everyone's opinions and answered all the questions we raised in detail. In order to reassure the patient's parents, the expert also took the initiative to talk to the parents, explaining and comforting them patiently for a long time. Before leaving, she repeatedly urged us on how to continue the rescue work. Her voice was hoarse, but she didn't even have time to drink a glass of water after coming to our hospital. Following the instructions of the Soviet expert, we finally rescued the critically ill baby from the brink of death.
    Many other Soviet experts from the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital have come to our hospital for consultation, giving us tremendous help and education, and introducing us to the advanced medical experience of the Soviet Union. This made me deeply appreciate the selfless friendship of the Soviet people towards us and their spirit of serving the patients. I will certainly follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "learn from the Soviet Union," strive to learn the advanced Soviet medical technology, learn the Soviet experts' high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and their spirit of wholeheartedly serving the patients without fear of hardship.

### 苏联专家的医术和优良作风加强了我们学习苏联的决心

专栏：读者来信摘要

    苏联专家的医术和优良作风
    加强了我们学习苏联的决心
    中央直属机关第一医院小儿科医生刘瑞林来信：前些日子，在我院住院的一个婴儿病势很沉重，我们用一切方法治疗都不见效，就打电话给北京苏联红十字医院，邀请苏联专家来会诊。我们在电话中谈了病儿的危急情况，对方接电话的那位同志立刻说：“只要苏联专家们有时间，一定会去的。”并问清了我们的电话号码。三分钟以后，对方来电话说：苏联专家有时间来我院会诊。我们提出马上派车子去接。对方答复：“苏联专家早已坐车子出发了！你们只要派一位同志在门口等着带专家进去就好了！”
    不久，到我院会诊的苏联红十字医院的小儿科专家杜比宁娜来了。她没有下车就关心地问病儿的情况，下车后比我们带路的同志还着急地大踏步进入了患儿的病室。接着，她就仔细地为病儿检查，还指示了我们不少应急的处置。这时，儿童医院的胡大夫也被请来会诊了（原来我们怕苏联专家没有空，所以也同时邀请了儿童医院的大夫）。胡大夫认为苏联专家已经会诊完了，自己就不必要再检查了。但是苏联专家却亲切地虚心地一定要胡大夫进行检查。在讨论诊断和治疗的时候，又不断征求我们大家的意见，并详尽地回答了我们所提的一切问题。为了使患儿家长安心，专家又主动和家长谈话，慈祥而耐心地作了很久解释和安慰。临走时，她还频频的叮嘱我们应该怎样继续抢救工作。她的嗓音都发哑了，但到我院来后却连一杯开水都没有工夫喝。依照苏联专家的指示，我们终于把病势危笃的小宝宝从死亡的边缘上救了回来。
    北京苏联红十字医院还有不少苏联专家曾来我院会诊，都给了我们巨大的帮助和教育，并向我们介绍了苏联的先进医学经验。这使我深刻地体会到了苏联人民对我们的无私友情和为病人服务的精神。我一定按着毛主席“学习苏联”的指示，努力学习苏联先进医学技术，学习苏联专家高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神以及不辞劳苦全心全意为病人服务的精神。
