Editor's Note: This newspaper published a report on February 28th, excerpted from reader letters, criticizing the work of Comrade Cui Yitian, Director of the East China Health Bureau. According to our subsequent investigation, some of the facts cited in this report are based on evidence, but many are inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, the criticism of Comrade Cui Yitian in this newspaper's February 28th editorial was inappropriate. In the spirit of "correcting mistakes if we have made them, and being on guard if we have not," Comrade Cui Yitian focused on examining the shortcomings in his work after reading the criticism in this newspaper. In addition to making a serious and sincere self-criticism regarding the shortcomings in his leadership at the East China Health Bureau's Party branch meeting and cadre meeting, he also wrote the following written self-criticism to this newspaper. We believe that Comrade Cui Yitian's attitude of seriously addressing criticism and resolving to correct shortcomings is correct. We believe that using this attitude to improve work will surely lead to progress in the working conditions of the East China Health Bureau.

My Self-Criticism
Cui Yitian

The People's Daily exposed and criticized some serious chaotic phenomena in the East China Administrative Committee Health Bureau on February 28th. I sincerely accept this criticism and make the following self-criticism:

Due to my usual lack of ideological leadership, and failure to understand the ideological situation of the masses and conduct necessary persuasive education in a timely manner during the initial stage of the organ reorganization, when the emotions of the masses were most easily fluctuating, in order to stabilize everyone's emotions and settle down to work, unnecessary ideological confusion and emotional fluctuations were aroused among a few comrades. Some business sections and divisions experienced short-term chaos due to the laxity of the work system, resulting in certain losses in work. This is due to my personal pragmatist and bureaucratic work style and lack of specific and ideological leadership. Our bureau does have unhealthy phenomena such as infrequent democratic life, a weak atmosphere of political study, and underdeveloped criticism and self-criticism. Especially in our work, we only provide generalized leadership, lacking investigation and research and in-depth specific leadership. In our work, we lack analytical and critical summaries, and we have also failed to consciously select key points, cultivate typical examples, absorb experiences, and promote work in a planned manner. Therefore, we cannot come up with a mature set of work experiences and specific methods in various tasks. This is the biggest shortcoming in our three years of work and the main reason for the serious shortcomings in our work. Another shortcoming in our work is blind development, emphasizing quantity over quality, only emphasizing the needs of the masses, lacking an assessment of subjective forces, and analyzing whether objective conditions allow it. In terms of leadership ideology, we are content with the status quo, satisfied with general superficial achievements, and lack sufficient understanding and timely and effective overcoming of shortcomings and errors in our work. More seriously, I have been indecisive in upholding principles and carrying out ideological struggles on certain issues and cadre issues. I have not deeply understood the importance of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and I have not clearly realized that leading cadres must set an example in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. This is the most important, most basic, and effective leadership method for actively developing and promoting work. Only when leading cadres can adhere to principles and engage in self-criticism can they promote democracy and give play to the enthusiasm of cadres, which serves as a force for promoting and improving various tasks. However, I have relaxed the grasp of this important leadership method that leading cadres should master, and there is a tendency towards liberalism. The most obvious manifestation of this is in dealing with cadre issues. I lack serious and earnest criticism and education for cadres with shortcomings and problems, and I also lack encouragement and praise for cadres who are responsible and work hard. I have adopted a conciliatory attitude of appeasement towards these principled issues, which has led to unclear rewards and punishments and unclear right and wrong in dealing with cadre issues. This has, to a certain extent, affected the improvement of the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, affected the progress and development of work, and also demonstrated the weakness and ineffectiveness of leadership. This is a manifestation of my serious petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness. I am afraid of criticizing others and also afraid of being criticized by others, and I have the wrong idea of fearing gains and losses. This is my biggest mistake in my thinking. This is a failure to earnestly implement the repeated teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, causing undue losses to the cause of the Party and the people. I sincerely accept the criticism given to me by the Party newspaper, and I am determined to correct the shortcomings and errors in my thinking and work in my future work and study.

    编者按：本报二月二十八日曾发表摘自读者来信的报道，批评华东卫生局局长崔义田同志的工作。根据我们事后的调查，这篇报道所举事实，有些是有根据的，但是也有许多与事实不符，因此，本报二月二十八日社论中关于崔义田同志的批评，是不适当的。崔义田同志根据“有则改之，无则加勉”的精神，在看了本报的批评以后，着重检查了自己工作中的缺点。他除在华东卫生局党支部的会议和干部会议上就自己领导工作上的缺点做了认真而诚恳的检讨以外，又向本报写了下面的书面检讨。我们认为崔义田同志这种认真对待批评和决心改正缺点的态度是正确的。用这种态度来改善工作，我们相信，一定可以使华东卫生局的工作状况得到进步。
    我的检讨
    崔义田
    二月二十八日人民日报揭发与批评了华东行政委员会卫生局一些严重的混乱现象，我诚恳地接受这一批评，并作如下检讨：
    由于我平时缺乏思想领导，又未在机关整编开始、群众情绪最易波动的当时，了解群众思想情况，及时进行必要的说服教育工作，以稳定大家情绪，安心工作，所以，在少数同志中引起了不必要的思想混乱，情绪波动，个别业务处、科，由于工作制度陷于松懈，发生了短时间的混乱现象，使工作遭受了一定的损失。这是由于我个人的事务主义的官僚主义作风，缺乏具体的领导和思想领导所致。本局的确存在着民主生活不经常，政治学习空气不浓厚，批评和自我批评不开展等不良现象，尤其在工作中只是一般化的领导，缺乏调查研究和深入的具体领导，在工作上缺乏分析批判性的总结，也未能有计划有意识的在工作中选择重点，培养典型，吸取经验，推动工作，因此，在各项工作中就拿不出一套成熟的工作经验和具体办法，这是我们三年工作中最大的缺点和工作中存在着严重缺点的主要原因。我们工作中的另一个缺点，就是盲目发展，重量不重质，只强调了群众的需要，缺乏对主观力量的估计，与分析客观各方面的条件是否允许。在领导思想上存在着满足现状，满足于一般的表面成绩，对工作中的缺点和错误则缺乏足够的认识和及时有效的克服。更严重的是我在某些问题及干部问题上，对坚持原则开展思想斗争是不坚决的，未深刻地体会到开展批评与自我批评的重要性，未明确地认识到开展批评与自我批评一定要领导干部以身作则，这是从积极方面开展和推动工作最主要最基本的有效的领导方法。领导干部能够坚持原则能够自我批评，才能发扬民主，才能发挥干部的积极性，作为推动与改进各种工作的力量。而我却将领导干部应该掌握的这种重要领导方法放松了，存在着自由主义的倾向，最明显的表现在对待干部的问题上，对有缺点和毛病的干部缺乏严肃认真的批评教育，对工作负责、任劳任怨的干部也缺乏鼓励与表扬，对待这些原则性的问题却采取了息事宁人的调和主义态度，这就使对干部的问题有赏罚不明、是非不清的地方，在一定程度上影响了干部和群众积极性的提高，影响了工作的进步与开展，也表现了领导的软弱无力，这是我存在着严重的小资产阶级思想意识的表现，怕批评别人，也怕别人批评自己，存在着患得患失的错误思想，这是我思想上的最大错误，这是未能认真执行党和毛主席一再的教导，给党和人民的事业造成了不应有的损失。我诚恳接受党报给我的批评，决心在今后的工作中、学习中，纠正我思想上工作中的缺点和错误。
