    Where are the Main Obstacles to Mobilizing the Masses to Discuss Plans at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant?
    Liu Zhenhua
    In mid-March, the work team of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Taiyuan Municipal Committee and the Propaganda Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant went to the steelmaking department of the plant to understand the ideological situation of the workers and discovered some obstacles in the discussion of production plans.
    Is it that the masses are conservative? Or that the leadership is backward?
    The workers in the steelmaking department have a very high level of enthusiasm for production, and the production tasks for the first three months of this year have been completed on schedule and even exceeded; and new records are constantly being set. These new records are mostly based on the workers' initiative, created on the basis of existing equipment and technical level. In late January and early February, new records of producing a furnace of steel in three hours and fifty-nine minutes and a new record for cold-charge smelting were created on the open-hearth furnace. These two new records were a great joy for the steelmaking department, but the workers on the open-hearth furnace did not receive any praise or encouragement as a result; on the contrary, some administrative leaders and technicians went to check the original records, asking "Was the time miscalculated?" and finally, without any basis, accused the workers of "violating operating procedures!" The deputy director of the department said: "This can't be right, you can't even calculate it that fast! I have never heard of a furnace of steel being produced in three hours and fifty-nine minutes!" This attitude of the leadership has had a very bad impact on the workers. Some workers reflected: "Better to be slower than faster, eight hours per furnace is no problem, but four hours per furnace gets you a reprimand!"
    Some of the rationalization proposals and tricks proposed by the masses have been shelved for more than a year. Workers reflect: "Tricks have to pass five levels (group leader, duty officer, technician, department director, factory department and supply department), it's as hard as climbing to heaven!" This time, when the factory was making plans, the leadership again called on everyone to "dig up potential and find tricks." The workers are even more dissatisfied. Kang Yulong, an old technical worker, said: "What are you asking us to suggest now! You should take the trouble to look at your notebooks, I'm afraid what's written there has already been suggested more than once!" This is indeed the case. The workers in the amateur backbone training class of the steelmaking department proposed nearly sixty suggestions and tricks this time, more than 70% of which were old things brought up again. For example, Hu Chengbao and other old ingot-making workers proposed improvements to the steel slag pan in February last year (which, if implemented, could save about one billion yuan per month), but it has not been dealt with yet, and this time it was proposed again as a "new" suggestion!
    Is it that the masses have low awareness? Or that the leadership neglects the safety and welfare of employees?
    Among the workers in the steelmaking department, there is another common opinion, that the leadership does not pay enough attention to safety and welfare issues, and that solutions are not timely. The workers say: "You promise anything you want when you need us, but you don't give us anything when it's over!" In the training class, the opinions related to safety and welfare issues accounted for more than 80% of all opinions, most of which were old problems that had been raised several times. For example, the raw material workers work on scrap steel every day, and if they are not careful, their soles may be pierced by steel tips. It was originally decided to issue leather shoes (with hard soles to prevent steel tips), but it has been delayed for several months, and there is no sign of them yet! Workers generally reflect: "It's useless to talk if the problem isn't solved!" These calls from the masses have not attracted the attention of the factory leadership. On the contrary, some cadres are avoiding the workers, afraid that the workers will make suggestions and ask for things, and one-sidedly believe: "This is a matter of awareness, the workers are asking too much." Is it really that the workers' demands are unreasonable or simply from a personal point of view? According to our understanding, with the exception of individual workers, most of the demands are reasonable. Worker Li Rongtang said: "It's not like we have to be given whatever we ask for right away, as long as the leadership gives us a clear answer. Don't the workers know who owns the factory now?" He said that the charcoal car foot of the gas furnace has been broken for more than a year, and if you are not careful, there will be personal accidents, but it has been reported to the leadership for more than a year and has not been repaired, "It's really just about getting the work done, and not about life or death!"
    Where are the main obstacles?
    We believe that the main obstacles to the current discussion of plans in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant are: the leading cadres have a bureaucratic work style, and have accumulated the opinions of the masses for a long time, creating a gap between the leadership and the masses. The situation in the steelmaking department proves that: we must start with combating bureaucracy, check the handling of suggestions from Soviet experts and rationalization proposals and tricks put forward by employees, and the leadership must conduct a deep self-criticism, in order to gradually mobilize the masses, discuss and formulate advanced production plans.

    太原钢铁厂发动群众讨论计划的主要障碍在哪里
    刘振华
    三月中旬，中共太原市委宣传部工作组和太原钢铁厂党委宣传部一起，到该厂炼钢部了解了一些职工思想情况，发现了一些讨论生产计划中的障碍。
    是群众保守呢？还是领导上落后？
    炼钢部的职工生产积极性很高，今年头三个月的生产任务都按期完成并超过了一些；而且不断出现新纪录。这些新纪录，绝大部分是基于工人的积极性，在现有设备和技术水平上创造出来的。一月下旬和二月初旬，平炉上曾创造出三时五十九分钟出一炉钢的新纪录和冷装冶炼新纪录，这两个新纪录是炼钢部空前的大喜事，但平炉上的工人并未因此得到任何一点表扬和鼓励；相反地，一些行政领导干部和技术人员却去查原始纪录，追问“是不是算错了时间？”，最后竟毫无根据地指责工人“违犯操作规程！”该部副主任说：“这哪能对头，光算数也不能这样快！我从来都没听说过三点五十九分能出一炉钢！”领导上这种态度，在工人中造成了很坏的影响。有些工人反映：“能慢些别快了，八小时出一炉没问题，四点钟出一炉就挨头子！”
    群众提出的合理化建议和窍门，有的压了一年多还未处理。工人反映：“窍门过五关（小组长、值班员、技术员、部主任、厂部和供应部门），好似登天难！”该厂这次订计划，领导上又号召大家“挖潜力，找窍门”。工人越加不满，老技术工人康玉龙说：“现在又叫我们提什么哩！你们还是费点劲看看笔记本吧，恐怕上边记的已经不是一次了！”事实也确是这样，炼钢部业余骨干分子训练班的工人，这次提出近六十条建议和窍门，其中有百分之七十以上是旧事新提。如制锭老工人胡成保等去年二月就提出了改进钢渣盘的建议（如能实现，每月可节省十亿元左右），迄今没有处理，这次又作为“新”建议提出了！
    是群众觉悟低呢？还是领导上轻视职工的安全福利？
    炼钢部的职工群众中，较普遍地存在着另一个主要意见，就是觉得领导上对安全福利问题重视不够，解决不及时。工人们说：“用着了要啥许啥，过去了要啥没啥！”在训练班中，提出的有关安全福利问题的意见，占全部意见的百分之八十以上，其中大部分是已提过几次的老问题。如原料工人每天在废钢上工作，一不小心鞋底就有被钢尖穿透的危险，原决定给发皮鞋（底子硬可防钢尖），但一直拖了几个月，连影子也没见！工人普遍反映：“不解决问题，说了也白说！”群众的这些呼声，一直没有引起该厂领导上的重视，相反地，有些干部却躲着工人，怕工人提意见要东西，并且片面地认为：“这是觉悟程度问题，工人要求太高。”真的是工人要求不合理或单纯从个人出发吗？据我们了解，除个别工人外，绝大部分的要求是合理的。工人李荣堂说：“我们又不是马上要啥就得给啥，只要领导上答复清楚就行了，工人还不知道现在的工厂是谁的吗？”他说，煤气炉底炭车脚子坏了一年多，一不小心就要出人身事故，但向领导上讲了一年多了还未修理，“真是光管干活，不管死活！”
    主要障碍在哪里？
    我们认为太原钢铁厂当前讨论计划中的主要障碍是：领导干部有官僚主义作风，长期地积压了群众的意见，造成了领导与群众之间的隔阂。炼钢部的情况证明：必须从反官僚主义入手，检查对苏联专家建议和职工提出的合理化建议与窍门的处理情况，由领导上进行深刻的检讨，才能逐步把群众发动起来，讨论和制订出先进的生产计划。
