    Korean Armistice Negotiations: Liaison group staff officers of both sides continue to discuss administrative details of repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war.
    Our side actively prepares to receive sick and wounded detainees.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 18th] The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations issued the following communique on April 18th:
    On April 18th, staff officers of the liaison group of both sides continued to discuss some specific administrative details concerning the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, which is scheduled to begin on April 20th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 18th] In just one more day, Korean and Chinese sick and wounded prisoners of war will gradually regain their freedom and return to the embrace of their motherland. The temporary hospitals set up by the Korean and Chinese side for them are nearing completion.
    The houses in Kaesong, which were destroyed by the American army, are in short supply for use as temporary hospitals. Most of the sick and wounded will live in tents. Now many green and white tents have been erected neatly. Today, the reporter visited a health inspection station of a hospital, which is located on the second floor of the original Kaichung Middle School. This building has been bombed by American aircraft. The engineering corps removed the rubble in the room in two days. Now there is a reception room, a barber shop, a changing room and a large bathroom inside. The bathroom was built in two days. After the sick and wounded take a bath, they can change into new clothes and be sent to different hospitals for treatment by ambulance. Nutritious meat and vegetables have been transported, and everyone can receive daily necessities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, towels, as well as cigarettes and candy. In order to provide sufficient nutrition for our sick and wounded prisoners of war, whose physical and mental health has been greatly damaged due to the lack of necessary medicines and treatment during their long detention by the US side, a large number of vitamin pills have also been transported.
    More than a dozen tents of various sizes have also been set up in our reception area in Panmunjom. Engineers paved the road leading to the reception area with gravel and sand, and also built edges on both sides of the road with white bricks. Lush small pine trees were planted in the reception area, and there is a red brick five-pointed star-shaped flower bed at the entrance.
    Freedom and happiness await our sick and wounded prisoners of war, these people who have suffered so much, even on the eve of their repatriation they continue to suffer abuse and persecution. According to today's Reuters report, the sick and wounded volunteers determined to be repatriated in Busan held a 24-hour hunger strike to demand that they cook their own food. What food and treatment they receive can be imagined.

    朝鲜停战谈判双方联络组参谋军官继续讨论遣返病伤战俘的行政细节问题
    我方积极准备接待病伤被俘人员工作
    【新华社开城十八日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月十八日发表公报如下：
    四月十八日双方联络组参谋军官继续就即将在四月二十日开始的病伤被俘人员的遣返的一些具体行政细节问题进行了讨论。
    【新华社开城十八日电】再过一天，朝中病伤被俘人员就要陆续获得自由重回祖国的怀抱。朝中方面为他们筹设的临时医院已接近完工。
    遭受美军破坏的开城供作临时医院的房舍很缺乏，大部病伤人员将在帐篷里居住，现在许多绿色和白色的帐篷已整齐地架设起来了。今天记者参观了一个医院的卫生检查站，它设在原开中中学的二层楼下，这座楼房已经被美机炸毁，工兵部队在两天中铲除了室内的瓦砾，现在内部已设有接待室、理发室、换衣室和一个很大的洗澡间。洗澡间是在两天中修成的，病伤人员洗过澡后，就可换上新衣，由救护车送入不同的医院治疗。富有营养的肉类和蔬菜已运到，每个人都可领到牙刷、牙膏、香皂、毛巾等日用品和香烟、糖。为了使在美方长期拘留下因缺乏必需的医药和治疗身心健康受到很大损坏的我方病伤被俘人员得到充足的营养，还运到了大批维他命丸。
    在板门店的我方接收区也已架起了十余个大小帐篷。工兵们用碎石和沙子铺平了通向接收区的公路，还用白色的砖在路两旁砌了边。接收区内栽上了苍翠的小松树，入口处有一个红砖砌成的五角星形的花坛。
    自由幸福在等待着我方的病伤被俘人员，这些饱经苦难的人们，甚至于在被遣返的前夕还继续遭受着虐待与迫害。据路透社今天的电讯报道，在釜山确定待遣返的志愿军病伤战俘为了要求自己烹调食物，举行了二十四小时的绝食，他们所得到的食物和待遇由此可以想见。
