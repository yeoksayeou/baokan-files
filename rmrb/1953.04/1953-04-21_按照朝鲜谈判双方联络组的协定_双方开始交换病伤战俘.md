Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th -- Starting at 9:00 AM on the 20th, both sides began exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war. Today, our side repatriated 100 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the other side, including 50 of Korean nationality and 50 of non-Korean nationality, including 30 Americans, 12 British, 4 Turks, and one each from Canada, the Philippines, the Union of South Africa, and Greece. The US side repatriated 500 of our sick and wounded captured personnel, including 400 captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and 100 captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The staff of our receiving area received the returning captured personnel with solemnity and concern. After they got out of the US ambulances, they were helped into tents for a short rest, and then taken to the health processing area in our ambulances, where they had their hair cut, took showers, and changed into new clothes before being transferred to specialized hospitals. The patients emerged from here completely refreshed.

Among the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army repatriated today, most were disabled. For example, one ambulance transported a total of ten people, eight of whom were disabled - six with lower limb amputations and two with upper limb amputations. Some were disabled after being injured in US prisoner-of-war camps, including one who lost his right arm. On May 7th of last year, when all 7,600 captured personnel on Camp 76 on Jeju Island refused the so-called "screening," the US side attacked the unarmed prisoners of war with tanks, flamethrowers, gas bombs, and hand grenades. His right arm was injured by the US military and subsequently amputated.

When the captured personnel got out of the US ambulances, their faces were pale, but they braced themselves and left the US vehicles. Some even saluted the Korean and Chinese reception personnel present. However, when our reception personnel shook hands with them to express their condolences, tears could not help but well up in their eyes.

In the US receiving area, as batches of our ambulances carrying the other side's prisoners of war arrived, healthy-looking, brisk prisoners of war got out of the vehicles one after another. Even the American reporters present repeatedly said that they were doing well. Many prisoners of war waved goodbye to our personnel.

    按照朝鲜谈判双方联络组的协定
    双方开始交换病伤战俘
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日上午九时起，双方开始交换病伤战俘。今天我方遣返的对方病伤战俘是一百人，其中朝鲜籍的五十人、非朝鲜籍的五十人，内美国三十人、英国十二人、土耳其四人、加拿大、菲律宾、南非联邦和希腊各一人。美方遣返的我方病伤被俘人员是五百人，其中四百人是朝鲜人民军被俘人员，一百人是中国人民志愿军被俘人员。
    我方接收区工作人员以严肃和关注的心情接待归来的我方被俘人员。他们从美方救护车上下来后，被扶进帐篷稍事休息，即乘上我方救护车，运到卫生通过区，在这里理发、洗澡、全部换上新衣服，然后再转到各专门的医院。病人从这里出来已经焕然一新。
    在今天被遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员中，大部都是残废，例如有一辆救护车一共运送了十个人，其中就有八个人是残废——六个人截断下肢，两个人截断上肢。有人是在美方战俘营中被打伤而残废的，其中一个断了右臂。他是在去年五月七日，当济州岛七十六营场七千六百名我方被俘人员全体拒绝受所谓“甄别”，美方用坦克、火焰喷射器、毒气炸弹和手榴弹向赤手空拳的战俘进攻时，右臂被美军打伤后锯掉的。
    被俘人员从美方救护车上下来时，脸色是苍白的，但他们都打起精神，离开美方的汽车，有的还向在场的朝中接待人员敬礼，但是当我方接待人员和他们握手表示慰问时，他们的眼泪就不禁夺眶而出。
    在美方接收区，当载着对方战俘的我方救护车一批批地到达时，面色健康，步履轻快的战俘陆续下车。连在场的美方记者都一再说他们很好。许多战俘挥手向我方人员告别。
