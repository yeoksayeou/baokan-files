Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th—Ikutaro Oyama, Chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, recently sent an open letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War.

The open letter stated: The Korean War has been going on for two years and nine months, and valuable lives are being lost in Korea every day. Because of this war, international tensions have been deepening, and we Japanese are constantly threatened by the danger of an expanded war and being drawn into the conflict.

The open letter continued: Since the armistice negotiations began in July of last year, we have believed that the day of peace restoration is near, and we have had great expectations. However, the armistice negotiations have been going on for one year and nine months, and an armistice has not yet been achieved. Since October of last year, the armistice negotiation meeting has been adjourned indefinitely.

Ikutaro Oyama pointed out in the letter: This time, due to the new proposal on the issue of prisoners of war put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, we believe that the biggest crux in the previous negotiations between the two sides, the issue of prisoners of war, should now lead to a consensus between the two sides. We firmly believe that the issue of prisoners of war can be agreed upon. The open letter emphasized: Our hope is for an immediate armistice and the restoration of peace.

    大山郁夫写信给艾森豪威尔
    要求停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会主席大山郁夫不久以前曾给美国总统艾森豪威尔一封公开信，要求立刻停止朝鲜战争。
    公开信说：朝鲜战争开始以来，已经有两年九个月，在朝鲜每天丧失着宝贵的生命。为了这个战争，国际间的紧张一直在加深，我们日本人也不断受到扩大战争、卷入战火危险的威胁。
    公开信接着说：自前年七月起，停战谈判开始，我们也以为和平恢复日近，抱了极大的期望。可是谈判开始后已经一年九个月，停战尚未实现。自去年十月以后，停战谈判会议竟无限期休会了。
    大山郁夫在信中指出：这次由于中华人民共和国周恩来总理对战俘问题提出新提案，我们认为以往双方谈判中最大的症结的战俘问题，双方的意见应该从此趋于一致。我们坚决相信，战俘问题是能够获得一致的。公开信强调说：我们的希望是立刻停战和恢复和平。
