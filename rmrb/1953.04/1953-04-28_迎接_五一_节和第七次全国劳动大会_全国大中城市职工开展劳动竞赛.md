(Xinhua News Agency, April 27th) The broad masses of workers in major and medium-sized cities across the country are enthusiastically launching labor competitions to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Labor Congress. To date, cities that have launched labor competitions include Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Changchun, Harbin, and Chengde in the Northeast region; Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Tangshan, and Gui Sui in the North China region; Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, and Huangshi in the Central and South China region; Shanghai, Qingdao, Fuzhou, and Hangzhou in the East China region; Chongqing and Kunming in the Southwest region; and Xi'an and Yumen in the Northwest region.

With the widespread unfolding of labor competitions, new production achievements are constantly emerging. In the operations room of the Changchun Locomotive Depot under the Harbin Railway Administration, production recorders have been busy rewriting the red flag competition record board in recent days, with new records constantly being replaced by even newer records. The time it takes for the overhaul team of this depot to meticulously inspect a locomotive has been reduced from twenty hours to thirteen and a half hours. After the workshops of Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 launched a "daily progress" competition, various major products can complete the state plan on a daily and ten-day basis. Shenyang Electric Factory No. 8 has completed the state production plan for April ten days ahead of schedule. All the teams in the forging workshop and ten teams in other workshops of the Beijing People's Machine General Factory have completed the April production plan six or seven days ahead of schedule. The Li Jinquan team of the repair department of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed the task of manufacturing 50,000 tons of mild steel welding rods for April ten days ahead of schedule. The workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory have built a "gift train," on which they record their daily and hourly labor competition achievements. On the 18th, the daily output of the No. 1 cement kiln of Huaxin Cement Company in the Central and South China region exceeded the designed capacity by 21.6 percent, setting a new national record. Workers in various places have not only increased output in the competition, but also improved product quality and ensured safe production. Locomotive No. 6576 of the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine in the Fuxin mining area, which is under construction, used to have frequent accidents. Since participating in the safety competition at the beginning of April, there has not been a single accident. The Lin Wangguo locomotive team has safely run 3,178 kilometers, creating a new record for safe operation after the competition. After Qingdao State-owned No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory launched a labor competition, the rate of substandard cloth in the weaving workshop has been reduced from 0.81 at the beginning of April to 0.3. Tian Gongqing, a sizing worker in the preparation workshop, created a new record of 99% qualified sizing content and 100% qualified water content.

In this labor competition, the broad masses of workers have demonstrated a high degree of creativity, striving to find tricks, tap potential, and improve production equipment and production tools. In the first ten days of the competition, the second and third workshops of the Dalian Chemical Plant in Dalian submitted 263 rationalization proposals. One "trick" about improving the air supply capacity of boilers, if implemented, can create 36 billion yuan of wealth for the country every year. On April 14th, Sun Wenxiu, a worker at the small rolling mill of the first branch of Tianjin Steel Plant, improved the rolling mill, reducing the number of rolling grooves from fifteen to thirteen, shortening the operation time, and increasing the production of dozens of tons of steel throughout the year.

In the labor competition, many factory and mine workers have also conscientiously learned and promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. After the coal washing workers of the coking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet "rapid float-sink method," the recovery rate of coal washing increased by 4.4 percentage points, and the ash content also decreased. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, Huang Qingtai, a labor model of the electric furnace steelmaking department of the plant, used asphalt to boil the magnesia bricks for lining the furnace, which doubled the utilization rate of the furnace wall and reduced the cost by 14 percent. Due to the implementation of the Soviet "cyclic overhaul system," the No. 3 boiler of the third power plant of the Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau in Hunan Province, which frequently had accidents, achieved 100% overhaul quality.

    迎接“五一”节和第七次全国劳动大会
    全国大中城市职工开展劳动竞赛
    【新华社二十七日讯】全国各大中城市的广大职工正在热烈展开劳动竞赛，迎接“五一”国际劳动节和第七次全国劳动大会。到目前为止，开展劳动竞赛的有东北地区的沈阳、旅大、鞍山、长春、哈尔滨、承德等市，华北区的北京、天津、太原、唐山和归绥等市，中南区的武汉、广州、长沙、南昌、黄石等市，华东区的上海、青岛、福州、杭州等市，西南区的重庆、昆明，西北区的西安、玉门等市。
    随着劳动竞赛的普遍展开，新的生产成就不断地涌现出来。在哈尔滨铁路管理局长春机务段的运转室里，生产纪录员这几天忙着改写红旗竞赛纪录板，新纪录不断地被更新的纪录所代替，该段检修小组细检一部机车的时间已从二十小时缩短到十三小时半。抚顺市石油一厂各车间发起“日进度”竞赛后，各种主要产品都能按日、按旬地完成国家计划。沈阳电工八厂已提前十天完成了四月份国家生产计划，北京人民机器总厂锻工车间的所有小组和其他车间的十个小组，已提前六天或七天完成了四月份的生产计划，北京石景山钢铁厂修理部李金泉小组提前十天完成了四月份制造五万吨软钢焊条的任务。华北农业机械总厂的职工们已造好“献礼列车”，列车上记载着他们每日每时的劳动竞赛的成绩。中南区的华新水泥公司第一号水泥窑十八日的日产量，超过了设计能力百分之二十一点六，创造了全国新纪录。各地职工在竞赛中不仅提高了产量，并且提高了产品质量和保证了安全生产。正在建设中的阜新矿区海州露天煤矿的六五七六号机车，过去常出事故，自四月初参加安全竞赛后，没有发生过一次事故；林万国包车组更安全地运行了三千一百七十八公里，创造了竞赛后安全运行的新纪录。青岛国营第三棉纺织厂展开劳动竞赛后，织布车间的次布率已从四月初的零点八一降低到零点三，准备车间浆纱工人田公顷创造了浆纱含浆合格率达百分之九十九，含水合格率达百分之百的新纪录。
    在这次劳动竞赛中，广大职工发挥了高度的创造性，努力找窍门，挖潜力，改进生产设备和生产工具。旅大市大连化工厂第二、第三两个车间在竞赛的头十天中，就提出二百六十三件合理化建议，其中一个关于提高锅炉送风能力的“窍门”，实行以后，每年就可为国家创造三百六十亿元的财富。天津钢厂一分厂小型轧钢场工人孙文秀在四月十四日改进了轧钢机，使轧钢槽孔从十五道减少为十三道，缩短了操作时间，全年可以增产几十吨钢材。
    在劳动竞赛中，许多工厂矿山的职工还认真学习和推广了苏联的先进经验。太原钢铁厂炼焦部洗煤工人推行苏联“快速浮沉法”的先进经验后，洗煤的回收率提高了百分之四点四，灰粉也有降低。在苏联专家启示下，该厂电炉炼钢部劳动模范黄庆泰用沥青把砌炉的?砖煮过，炉墙的利用率提高了一倍，成本降低百分之十四。湖南省湘中电业局第三发电厂由于推行了苏联的“巡回检修制”，使该厂经常发生事故的三号机炉，检修质量达到了百分之百。
