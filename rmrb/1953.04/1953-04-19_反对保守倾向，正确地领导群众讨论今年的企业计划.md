(Editor's note: The following is an abstract of the editorial in the recently published "Mechanical Industry" second issue. This editorial analyzes and criticizes the conservative thinking in formulating the annual production plan, and puts forward positive ways to formulate advanced plans and complete the plans. At present, all enterprise units should seriously discuss and formulate advanced annual production plans. This editorial is worth your reference.)
    Oppose Conservative Tendencies and Correctly Lead the Masses in Discussing This Year's Enterprise Plan

    The mechanical industry's production tasks for this year have been stipulated, and the total annual output value will increase by 64% compared with last year.
    There is a certain basis for formulating this year's production plan of increasing by 64%: last year's growth rate of mechanical industry production was over 66%; the tasks of some existing enterprises have not yet been met; the results of the production capacity assessment last year showed that, calculated according to fixed products, this year's production capacity can be increased by 1.25 times compared with last year; the completion of some capital construction can be put into production; the continued improvement of enterprise management and the improvement of technical level will further boost productivity. These are all important favorable factors to ensure the completion of this year's plan.
    Of course, there are difficulties, and with the development of production, difficulties will continue to appear. Precisely because of this, we need to work hard. Any victory is the result of overcoming difficulties.
    In the implementation of the first quarter production plan this year and in the process of revising the annual plan, some cadres showed a certain degree of negative emotions in their thinking. They emphasized the difficult side and underestimated the possibility of overcoming difficulties, thus requiring the reduction of various indicators of the plan. Obviously, this emotion cannot guide the masses to correctly discuss the enterprise plan and formulate advanced production increase and economy plans; conversely, it will inevitably limit the play of the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, which must be guarded against and overcome.
    The main reasons for not being able to complete the plan are: increasing temporary tasks or changing products disrupts the plan, making production technical preparations too late; lack of parts or some materials prevents products from being completed; insufficient tasks or lack of drawings; high scrap rate; reduced labor productivity and chaotic management, etc. The various reasons for the failure to complete the first quarter's production plan are precisely the main problems in the current work. If these problems are not solved, this year's plan will certainly not be guaranteed, but the attitude we take towards these problems is a key to whether we can solve the problems.
    Some comrades emphasized these problems and used the failure to complete the first quarter's production plan as a reason and basis for lowering the annual plan. They believe that these difficulties are not easy or even impossible to overcome, so they demanded a reduction in the plan. Individual enterprises even proposed to reduce the original plan by 30%. The starting point of these comrades' request to lower the plan indicators is, of course, to ensure the complete completion of the plan. However, what kind of plan should we have: an advanced one or a conservative one? Obviously, some comrades have deviations in their thinking on this issue. Neither now nor in the future will the country and the people allow us to formulate a conservative plan. Because such a plan cannot organize and inspire the broad masses of workers and is not enough to accelerate the country's industrialization, it does not conform to the interests of the people.
    Can these difficulties be overcome? The answer is yes: difficulties can be overcome. Comprehensive various existing problems, mainly: tasks, materials, and organization. These aspects not only have difficulties today, but will still have difficulties in the future. However, it must be recognized that we are constantly advancing in these aspects. Therefore, merely using the current temporary situation as the basis for formulating the plan ignores development and ignores the possibility of overcoming difficulties. Changes in tasks will cause the plan to be constantly revised, which is inevitable in a certain period.
    Strengthening organizational work is of universal significance for ensuring the completion of the plan. Judging from the current situation of the ministry, bureaus, and factories, they are generally still in a state of unsound organization and unclear responsibilities. There is still a considerable degree of chaos in production management, forming supply disconnection, uncoordinated cooperation, chaotic drawing management, uncontrollable production process, low efficiency, and many defects. In response to these situations, the central link of the mechanical industry's work this year is to strengthen planning and organization. The process of continuously strengthening this work is also the process of gradually overcoming difficulties. Ignoring this development trend will inevitably lead to conservative tendencies.
    The reason why conservative emotions arise is, first of all, a lack of understanding of the current political situation, and a failure to understand the serious significance of taking a positive attitude to complete the national plan, and therefore easily advocating lowering the plan. From this, we can also see that the view that "the plan is the law of the country" is still very unclear among our cadres.
    The emergence of conservative emotions is also inseparable from bureaucracy in leadership work. If we cannot comprehensively and deeply understand the real situation of the work departments we manage, the leadership work will appear weak and powerless, and we will not be able to correctly estimate the difficulties, let alone fully estimate and give play to the possibility of overcoming the difficulties.
    Conservative emotions often arise from underestimating the strength of the masses. They often do not estimate the enthusiasm of the masses within the plan. But experience has proved that conservative plans are always broken by the masses. If leading cadres do not actively estimate and guide the enthusiasm of the masses, it is easy to invite passivity in work. This is something that enterprise leaders should be vigilant about.
    The basic method of overcoming difficulties is to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. The experience of the past few years has proved that leading cadres at all levels tend to be conservative when formulating production plans. Raw material consumption and reserve quotas are always set higher, and labor and working capital are always required more. However, labor productivity and cost reduction rates are often set lower. But these conservative indicators are broken once they are discussed by the masses, so a more advanced plan is formulated, and in the end, the plan is often overfulfilled. This year's production plan has been preliminarily discussed by factories in the Northeast. Taking the water pump produced by Mechanical Factory No. 6 as an example, the product's type specifications are very complicated, and there are also difficulties in production technology, drawings, and material supply, but after the plan was discussed by the masses, it was increased by 20% compared with the original plan, and it can still be guaranteed to be completed. This situation shows that relying on the masses to overcome difficulties can formulate and ensure the completion of advanced enterprise plans.
    Launching the masses to discuss the enterprise plan and formulate the enterprise's production increase and economy plan is of decisive significance for ensuring the completion of this year's plan. Correctly leading this work, the key lies in resolutely fighting against various conservative emotions, in fully developing and guiding the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and in finding solutions to specific difficulties and weak links. In formulating and leading the masses to discuss the enterprise plan, opposing conservative tendencies is the main aspect, but at the same time, it is also necessary to prevent the blind and rash tendency of deviating from reality. Leading comrades of all enterprises must resolutely overcome bureaucratic work style, go deep into the masses, specifically understand the various real situations of their enterprises, and explore the various potential favorable factors. Only in this way can they guide the masses to formulate a scientifically based advanced plan and ensure the completion and even over-completion of this plan.

### 反对保守倾向，正确地领导群众讨论今年的企业计划

专栏：

    编者按：这是最近出版的“机械工业”第二期的社论的摘要。这篇社论分析和批判了在制订全年生产计划中的保守思想，并提出了制订先进的计划和完成计划的积极办法。目前所有的企业单位都应该认真讨论和制订全年的先进的生产计划，这篇社论值得大家参考。
    反对保守倾向，正确地领导群众讨论今年的企业计划
    机械工业今年的生产任务已经规定了，全年的生产总值将较去年增加百分之六十四。
    制订今年增长百分之六十四的生产计划是有一定根据的：去年机械工业生产的增长率就在百分之六十六以上；现有若干企业的任务尚未满足；去年生产能力查定结果显示，按照固定产品计算，今年生产能力可较去年提高一·二五倍；部分基本建设的完成可以投入生产；企业管理的继续改进和技术水平的提高，将使生产力进一步高涨。这些都是保证今年计划完成的重要的有利因素。
    当然，困难是有的，而且随着生产的发展，困难还会继续不断地出现，正因为这样，才需要我们努力奋斗。任何胜利，都是克服了困难的结果。
    在今年第一季生产计划的执行中和修订全年计划的过程中，有一些干部在思想上表现出某种程度的消极情绪。他们强调困难的一面，低估了克服困难的可能性，从而要求降低计划的各项指标。显然，这种情绪是不可能引导群众正确地讨论企业计划和制订先进的增产节约计划的；反过来，它必将限制群众积极性和创造性的发挥，这是必须加以警惕和克服的。
    不能完成计划的主要原因是：增加临时任务或变更产品而打乱了计划，使生产技术准备来不及；缺乏零件或部分材料，使产品不能完成；任务不足或缺少图纸；废品率大；劳动生产率降低及管理混乱等等。第一季生产计划不能完成的各项原因，正是当前工作中的主要问题，这些问题如不加以解决，今年计划当然就无法保证，但是我们采取什么态度来对待这些问题，却是能否解决问题的一个关键。
    某些同志强调这些问题，把第一季生产计划未能完成的情况，作为降低全年计划的理由和根据。他们认为这些困难是不容易甚至是不可能克服的，因此要求减低计划，个别企业甚至提出要求减低原订计划的百分之三十。这些同志要求降低计划指标的出发点，当然是为了保证计划的全部完成，然而，我们应当有一个什么计划：是先进的呢？还是保守的呢？显然某些同志在这个问题上，思想有了偏差。不论现在或今后，国家和人民都不允许我们制订一个保守的计划。因为这样的计划不能够组织和鼓舞广大职工，不足以加速国家的工业化，因而是不符合人民利益的。
    这些困难能不能克服呢？答复是肯定的：困难可以克服。综合目前存在的各种问题，主要是：任务、材料和组织。这些方面不但今天有困难，今后仍然会有困难。然而必须认识我们正是在这些方面不断地前进着，因此仅仅以目前的暂时情况作为制订计划的根据，那就忽视了发展，忽视了克服困难的可能。任务变化会使计划不断修改，这在一定时期内是不可避免的。
    组织工作的加强，对于保证计划的完成是具有普遍意义的。从部、局、厂目前的情况看，一般都还处于组织不健全、职责不明确的状态。生产管理上还存在相当程度的混乱现象，形成供应脱节、协作不灵、图纸管理紊乱、生产过程控制不住、效率低、废品多等情况。针对这些情况，机械工业今年工作的中心环节是加强计划性和组织性，这一工作不断加强的过程，也就是困难逐渐克服的过程，忽视这一发展的趋势，就必然要产生保守倾向。
    保守情绪之所以产生，首先是对于当前的政治形势认识不足，不了解采取积极态度完成国家计划的严重意义，因而轻易主张降低计划。由此也可看到，在我们的干部当中“计划就是国家的法律”的观点还很不明确。
    保守情绪的产生，和领导工作中的官僚主义也是分不开的。不能全面地深入地了解自己所管理的工作部门的真实情况，领导工作就显得软弱无力，就不能正确地估计困难，更不能充分估计和发挥克服困难的可能性。
    保守情绪又往往产生于对群众力量的估计不足。他们常常不把群众的积极性估计在计划之内。但经验证明，保守的计划，总是被群众所打破。领导干部如果不主动地估计和引导群众的积极性，就容易招致工作上的被动。这一点是值得企业领导同志警惕的。
    克服困难的基本方法是动员群众和依靠群众。过去几年的经验证明，各级领导干部在制订生产计划时往往倾向保守，原材料消耗和储备定额总是定得高些，劳动力和流动资金总是要得多一点；而劳动生产率和降低成本率常是定得低些。但是这些保守的指标一经群众讨论，就被打破，从而订出了比较先进的计划，并且最后往往是超额完成了计划。今年的生产计划，东北各厂已经初步讨论，以机械六厂生产的水泵为例，产品的型式规格都很复杂，生产技术、图纸和材料供应也有困难，但计划经过群众讨论后，比原订计划提高了百分之二十，仍可保证完成。这种情况说明，依靠群众克服困难，就能订出并保证完成先进的企业计划。
    发动群众讨论企业计划和制订企业的增产节约计划，这一工作对于保证今年计划的完成有决定意义。正确地领导这一工作，关键在于向各种保守情绪作坚决的斗争，在于充分发挥和引导群众的积极性和创造性，针对具体困难和薄弱环节，找出解决办法。在制订和领导群众讨论企业计划的工作中，反对保守倾向是主要的一面，但同时也要防止脱离实际的盲目冒进倾向。各企业的领导同志必须坚决克服官僚主义作风，深入群众，具体了解本企业的各种真实情况，发掘潜在着的各种有利因素，只有这样，才能引导群众订出一个有实际根据的先进的计划，并保证完成以至超额完成这个计划。
