    The central channel project of the Bo崗 Diversion Canal has been completed ahead of schedule in mid-April, and more than 98,000 laborers have been transferred to spring plowing and production. The Bo崗 Diversion Canal project is the largest earthwork project for "diversion" of the main and tributary streams in the middle reaches of the Huai River (within Jiashan County and below Wuhe County) in 1953. Due to the excessive amount of earth excavation, this project is divided into two phases: the first phase is the excavation of the central channel project, totaling 14,311,800 cubic meters of earthwork; the second phase is the widening, cutting, and expansion project, which will be completed in 1954. Upon completion of this project, 1,820,000 mu of farmland in the southeastern part of the Suxian Prefecture of Anhui Province will be protected from floods. In normal flood years, the water level of the inland rivers near Wuhe County can be reduced by three meters, freeing 1,260,000 mu of farmland from waterlogging, and indirectly benefiting 10,000,000 mu of farmland, which can increase grain production worth approximately 54.5 billion yuan in RMB. At the same time, it has made appropriate improvements to the river course of the main stream of the Huai River, shortening the waterway distance of the main stream by 15 li compared to before. If the navigation channel of the Xiacaowan Diversion Canal and the Jingpiahewa are coordinated and straightened out in the future, the navigation distance can be shortened by more than 70 li.
    The Bo崗 Diversion Canal project started in full swing in early December last year, with the participation of 130,000 laborers. During the construction process, the laborers overcame the difficulties of unfamiliar technology and lack of tools, and also learned and created new technologies and new tools, improving work efficiency. In the early stage of this project, due to the lack of thorough planning by the leading departments and the serious bureaucratic style of some cadres, low wages and poor living conditions for the laborers occurred. Since the implementation of the new wage standard in February, the laborers have not only basically eliminated the phenomenon of low wages and insufficient food, but most of them have also had savings. For example, more than 80 laborers in the No. 2 Squad of the No. 3 Company of the No. 1 Brigade of the Liu’an Headquarters saved a total of 19,650,000 yuan in RMB, with an average saving of 250,000 yuan per person.
    The central channel project was originally scheduled to be completed and flooded on April 30, but due to the reduction in the number of laborers, it was decided to postpone the completion to May 10. However, with the active labor of the laborers, it was completed 20 days ahead of schedule in mid-April. At present, more than 98,000 laborers have been transferred to rear production, and the remaining 30,000 laborers are working hard on soil clearing and slope trimming. (Xi Qi, Jin Kong)

    泊岗引河中泓工程提前完工
    泊岗引河工程中的中泓工程已在四月中旬提前完工，已有九万八千多民工转入春耕生产。泊岗引河工程是一九五三年度淮河中游（嘉山境内、五河县以下）干支“分流”的最大土方工程。这个工程因土方开挖过大，分作两期施工：第一期是开挖中泓工程，共土方一千四百三十一万一千八百公方；第二期为拓宽、切摊、扩大工程，将在一九五四年完成。这个工程完成后，将使安徽省宿县专区东南部的一百八十二万亩农田免受水灾，在平常洪水年份，五河县附近内河水位可降低三公尺，使一百二十六万亩农田免除内涝，并使一千万亩农田间接受益，可增产约值人民币五百四十五亿多元的粮食；同时对淮河干流的河道形势作了适当的改善，使干流的水路航程较前缩短了十五华里，如以后配合整理出下草湾引河、经漂河洼的航道，航程即可缩短七十余华里。
    泊岗引河工程，是在去年十二月上旬全面开工的，参加兴修的有十三万民工。在施工过程中，民工们克服了技术不熟练和工具缺乏的困难，还学习和创造了新的技术和新的工具，提高了工作效率。在进行这期工程的初期，因领导部门缺乏周密的计划和若干干部有严重的官僚主义作风，以致发生民工工资低和居住条件很坏的现象。自二月份实行新工资标准后，民工不但基本上消灭了工资低，不够吃的现象，并且多数民工都有节余。如六安指挥所
    一大队三中队二分队八十多个民工，共节余人民币一千九百六十五万元，平均每人可节余二十五万元。
    中泓工程原计划在四月三十日完工放水，后因民工人数减少，决定推迟到五月十日完工，但在民工积极劳动下，在四月中旬提前二十天完成。目前已有九万八千多民工转入后方生产，其余三万多民工正在紧张地进行清土、铲坡。（奚奇、锦空）
