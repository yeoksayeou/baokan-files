    Fangshan County People's Government Blindly Promoted Wheat Seed, Causing Huge Losses
    Xiao Cao's letter: The Fangshan County People's Government in Hebei Province should promptly examine and correct the bureaucratic work style in leading production. Last autumn, the county government blindly promoted the "Henan White" wheat seed locally, and the county planted 4,000 mu of wheat with this seed. Upon inspection now, 3,700 mu of the 4,000 mu of wheat have died. The main reason is that the county government, disregarding climatic conditions, blindly transported wheat seeds from Henan Province to northern Hebei for planting. The wheat farmers are very dissatisfied, but the Fangshan County People's Government has not yet made a public self-criticism or come up with active measures to recover this loss and its impact.

    房山县人民政府盲目推广麦种造成巨大损失
    小曹来信：河北省房山县人民政府应该迅速检查并纠正领导生产工作中的官僚主义作风。去年秋季，该县人民政府在当地盲目推广“河南白”麦种，全县用这种麦种种上了四千亩小麦。到现在一检查，四千亩小麦已死去了三千七百亩。其主要原因是该县人民政府不顾气候条件，盲目地把河南省的麦种运到河北北部来种。种麦户十分不满，可是房山县人民政府至今还没有作公开检讨和想积极办法挽回这一损失和影响。
