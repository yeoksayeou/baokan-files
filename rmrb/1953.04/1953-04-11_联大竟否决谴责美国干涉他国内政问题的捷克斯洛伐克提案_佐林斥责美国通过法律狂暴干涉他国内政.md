Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 10th: The United Nations General Assembly discussed the Czechoslovakian proposal regarding the US interference in other countries' internal affairs at its afternoon session on April 8th.

    Many representatives spoke in succession, explaining their positions on the vote.

    Soviet representative Zorin pointed out that the Soviet delegation had already explained its position on this issue during the debate in the Political Committee. He said that the Soviet delegation reiterated its position and considered it necessary to call the attention of the United Nations General Assembly to the fact that the United States, on October 10, 1951, and June 20, 1952, passed laws stipulating the recruitment of nationals of other countries to form armies, subversive groups, and terrorist organizations. These laws frenziedly interfered in other countries' internal affairs and flagrantly violated the basic principles of international law and the basic provisions of the United Nations Charter. This is why the Soviet delegation supports the Czechoslovak delegation's proposal and will vote in favor of it.

    The US representative, who spoke next, attempted to deny the fact that the US was interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries. He also stated that he would vote against the Czechoslovak proposal.

    The representatives of Guatemala and Argentina said that they would abstain. However, they pointed out that their governments were the most resolute in upholding the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

    After Polish representative Katz-Suchy spoke in support of the Czechoslovak proposal, the General Assembly voted on the proposal. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Poland voted in favor of the Czechoslovak proposal. The representatives of fourteen countries (mostly Asian and Arab countries, Guatemala, and Argentina) abstained. The delegations of forty countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted against the proposal. As a result, the proposal was not passed by the United Nations General Assembly.

    The General Assembly plenary session adjourned at this point.

    联大竟否决谴责美国干涉他国内政问题的捷克斯洛伐克提案
    佐林斥责美国通过法律狂暴干涉他国内政
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会四月八日下午会议讨论捷克斯洛伐克所提关于美国干涉他国内政问题的提案。
    许多代表相继发言说明他们投票的立场。
    苏联代表佐林指出：苏联代表团在政治委员会进行辩论时已经说明了它对于这个问题的立场。他说，苏联代表团重申它的立场，并认为有必要促请联合国大会注意这个事实，即：美国在一九五一年十月十日及一九五二年六月二十日通过了规定召募其他国家的国民组成军队、颠覆性集团以及恐怖组织的法律，这些法律狂暴地干涉他国内政，并悍然违反国际法的基本原则与联合国宪章的基本条款。这就是苏联代表团为什么支持捷克斯洛伐克代表团的提案，并将投票赞成这个提案的原因。
    跟着发言的美国代表，试图否认美国正在干涉苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的内政的事实，他并且表示将投票反对捷克斯洛伐克的提案。
    危地马拉和阿根廷的代表说，他们将弃权。但是，他们指出：他们两国的政府是最坚决地拥护不干涉他国内政的原则的。
    在波兰代表卡茨—苏希发言声明支持捷克斯洛伐克提案之后，大会便对这个提案进行表决。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国、白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国和波兰代表团投票赞成捷克斯洛伐克的提案。十四国代表（大多数亚洲和阿拉伯国家、危地马拉和阿根廷）弃权。包括美国、英国、法国在内的四十个国家的代表团投票反对这个提案，结果，这个提案在联合国大会竟未获通过。
    大会全体会议至此休会。
