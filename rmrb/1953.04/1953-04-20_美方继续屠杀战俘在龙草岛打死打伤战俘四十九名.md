Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: On April 17th, the U.S. side once again carried out a bloody massacre of our POWs in the Dragon Grass Island POW camp, killing four of our captured personnel on the spot and wounding forty-five.

According to the U.S. side, during this massacre on Dragon Grass Island, U.S. military guards used a reinforced platoon to rush into the camp and used shotguns, concussion grenades, and tear gas. The only excuse for the U.S. massacre of POWs is that the POWs "refused" "inspection." This incident shows that the U.S. side is stepping up the creation of so-called POWs who "refuse repatriation."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th: According to the U.S. side, on April 12th, the U.S. side injured one of our captured personnel on Geoje Island under the pretext of "escape," and the injury was serious.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: According to the U.S. side, on April 15th, the U.S. side injured another of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island POW camp, for the mere reason that the POW "ran out of their housing after dark."

    美方继续屠杀战俘在龙草岛打死打伤战俘四十九名
    【新华社开城十九日电】四月十七日美方又在龙草岛战俘营对我方战俘进行血腥屠杀，我方被俘人员四名当场被打死，四十五名受伤。
    据美方宣布，在此次龙草岛的屠杀事件中，美军警卫队用一个加强排冲进营场，并使用了散弹枪、震荡手榴弹和催泪弹。美方屠杀战俘的唯一借口是战俘们“拒绝”“检查”。这个事件表明美方正在加紧制造所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”。
    【新华社开城十五日电】据美方公布，四月十二日，美方在巨济岛又借口“逃跑”打伤我方被俘人员一名，伤势严重。
    【新华社开城十六日电】据美方宣布，四月十五日，美方在巨济岛战俘营中又打伤我方被俘人员一名，理由仅仅是因为战俘“在天黑以后跑出他们的住房来”。
