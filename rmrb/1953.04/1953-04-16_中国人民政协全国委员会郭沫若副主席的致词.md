Comrades, honored guests!

    The Second National Women's Congress of China is opening, and on behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I extend my warm congratulations and wish the congress a brilliant success.

    In the four years since the First National Women's Congress of China was held in March 1949, our country has undergone unprecedented and large-scale changes. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our people's revolution has been victorious, and we have established the People's Republic of China, which practices people's democratic dictatorship. We have made great achievements in social reform, national construction, uniting international friends, and defending the cause of peace and opposing aggression. The liberated and progressive Chinese women have played a significant role in all aspects of work.

    This year is the first year that our national construction has embarked on planned construction. The Central People's Government has promulgated the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China," and will soon conduct a general election, convene national and local people's congresses at all levels, and formulate a constitution. Therefore, 1953 is a year of great historical significance for us. The convening of the Second National Women's Congress of China at this time will undoubtedly play a significant role in mobilizing women across the country to respond to the call of the state and implement the major tasks currently at hand.

    The vast masses of Chinese women possess very rich potential labor power. We hope that our women, on the basis of their existing achievements, can be further mobilized and organized to participate more widely in industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of national construction, so that their great potential can be fully realized. This will be an important guarantee for the completion of the national construction plan and an important guarantee for promoting the industrialization of the motherland.

    Article 6 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "Women shall enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life." Article 4 of the recently promulgated Election Law, in addition to explicitly stating that there is no distinction based on "sex," further stipulates that "women shall have equal rights with men to elect and be elected." The state particularly respects women's political rights. Therefore, we also hope that the broad masses of Chinese women can actively participate in the election of people's congresses and complete the solemn task of formulating a constitution, so as to consolidate and develop our people's democratic power.

    National construction requires us to exert our active subjective forces, and it also requires us to strive for peaceful objective conditions. The cause of defending peace in Asia and the world is inseparable from the cause of national construction. The broad masses of Chinese women have made great contributions in the work of uniting international friends, especially in supporting the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but we hope that our women will continue to work harder and make greater contributions in the future, so as to strengthen the strength of the peace and democracy camp and eliminate existing and future wars of aggression.

    Comrades, we are in a great historical era. We have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and the friendly assistance of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union. The future of our motherland is infinitely bright. Let us further unite with the people of China and the good people of the world to strive together for the victory of national construction and the victory of defending peace!

    Glory belongs to the high practice of patriotism and internationalism!

    中国人民政协全国委员会郭沫若副主席的致词各位代表，各位来宾！
    中国第二次全国妇女代表大会开幕，我代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会表示热诚的庆贺，预祝大会获得辉煌的成就。
    从一九四九年三月中国妇女第一次全国代表大会召开以来，四年当中，我们的国家起了史无前例的极大规模的变化。在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，我们的人民革命胜利了，建立了实行人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，在社会改革方面、国家建设方面、团结国际友人反对侵略及保卫和平事业方面，都有了很大的成就。获得了解放的进步的中国妇女，在各方面的工作中都是发挥了很大的力量的。
    今年是我们国家建设走上计划建设的第一年，中央人民政府已经颁布了“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”，将在最近进行普选，召开全国及地方各级人民代表大会，制定宪法。因此，一九五三年在我们是具有伟大历史意义的一年。中国第二次全国妇女代表大会在目前召开，无疑地，它将在动员全国妇女响应国家号召，执行当前各项重大任务方面，起其重大作用。
    中国广大的妇女群众具有非常丰富的潜在劳动力量。我们希望我们的妇女群众，在既得的成就基础之上，能够更进一步地发动起来，组织起来，更广泛地参加工农生产和各方面的国家建设工作，使伟大的潜在能力能够得到充分的发挥。这将是完成国家建设计划的一个重要的保障，也是促使祖国走向工业化的一个重要的保障。
    共同纲领第六条规定得很明白：“妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。”最近颁布的选举法第四条，于不分“性别”的明文之外，更特别规定出“妇女有与男子同等的选举权和被选举权”。国家是特别尊重妇女在政治上的权利的。因此，我们同样希望中国的广大妇女群众能够积极地参加人民代表大会的选举，完成制定宪法的庄严任务，以巩固并发展我们的人民民主政权。
    国家建设需要我们发挥积极的主观力量，同时也需要我们争取和平的客观条件。保卫亚洲和平与世界和平的事业和国家建设事业是分不开来的。中国的广大妇女群众，在团结国际友人的工作中，特别是在支援抗美援朝的工作中，曾经有了很大的贡献，但我们希望我们的妇女群众今后要更加努力不懈，作出更大的贡献，以加强和平民主阵营的力量，消灭现有的和未来的侵略战争。
    各位代表，我们是处在伟大的历史时代。我们有毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导，有以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的友好互助，我们祖国的前途是无限光明的。请让我们更进一步与全中国人民和全世界善良的人民团结一致，为争取国家建设事业的胜利、保卫和平事业的胜利而共同奋斗吧！
    光荣属于爱国主义与国际主义的高度的实践！
