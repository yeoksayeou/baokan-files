Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 12th: The West German "Freie Volkszeitung" published an article by Otto Niebergall, a member of the West German Federal Parliament, on February 16th of this year, exposing the situation of West Germany's preparation for germ warfare under American guidance.

Niebergall pointed out that the war treaty signed according to the will of the United States regards germ warfare as a completely natural thing. For example, Article 107 of the "European Defense Community" agreement stipulates that those military industries should be established in areas that are "strategically unthreatened" under the command of the Standing Committee of the "European Army." In the footnote to this article, bacterial weapons are mentioned at the same time as atomic weapons and chemical weapons, and the footnote specifically states: "Bacterial weapons refer to all specially designed equipment and instruments that use harmful vermin and other living or dead organic matter or their toxic products for military purposes."

Niebergall said: "In a letter written to the Western High Commissioners on May 7, 1952, Adenauer requested that the army to be established in West Germany after the signing of the war treaty must be equipped with the same weapons as the troops of other countries, which means that it must also be equipped with bacterial weapons."

Niebergall continued: "Just a few weeks later, the 'Blank Department' (the de facto Ministry of the Army in Bonn) requested an investigation into former German military biologists and military bacteriologists in order to complete a list. The bacteriological experts on this list will be sent to the chemical laboratory of the American occupation forces in Hanau for training. After they have been trained in all the latest methods of conducting germ warfare, they will be assigned to special forces of the 'European Army' to work."

Niebergall also pointed out that under the guidance of the American occupation forces, a school of "Applied Chemistry and Biology" has been opened in Weihershof near Kirchheim-Bolanden in Rhineland-Palatinate; the so-called "Civil Defense Association" of the Hitler era, which was revived with the help of the Ministry of the Interior, distributed a booklet entitled "Knowledge of Germ Warfare" to all its staff. Niebergall concluded: "All this shows that those warmongers will stop at nothing in instigating the new serious events they crave."

    揭露阿登纳傀儡在美国指导下准备细菌战
    【新华社十二日讯】柏林消息：西德“自由人民报”今年二月十六日刊载西德联邦议院议员奥托·尼贝尔加尔的一篇文章，揭露西德在美国指导下进行细菌战准备的情形。
    尼贝尔加尔指出，按照美国的意志签订的战争条约把细菌战看成是完全自然的事情，例如，在“欧洲防务集团”协定第一百零七条中规定了那些军事工业应在“欧洲军”常务委员会的命令之下，在“战略上不受威胁”的地区建立起来，在这一条的附注中，与提到原子武器和化学武器的同时，提到了细菌武器，附注并且特别说明：“细菌武器就是指一切特别设计的、为了军事目的而使用有害的毒虫以及其他活的或死的有机物或是它们的有毒的产物的设备与器具。”
    尼贝尔加尔说：“阿登纳在一九五二年五月七日写给西方高级专员的一封信中要求，在签订战争条约以后，将要在西德建立起来的军队必须用与其他国家部队同样的武器装备起来，这就是说，必须也用细菌武器装备起来。”
    尼贝尔加尔继续说：“仅仅几个星期之后，‘布兰克部’（波恩实际上的陆军部）就要求调查前德国的军事生物学家和军事细菌学家以便完成一个名单。在这个名单上的细菌学专家将被送到哈诺的美国占领军的化学实验室中去受训。等到他们受过了进行细菌战的一切最新方法的训练之后，他们将被派到‘欧洲军’的特种部队中去工作。”
    尼贝尔加尔并指出，在美国占领军指导下，在莱因兰—帕拉丁耐特州吉尔希莱姆—波兰登附近的威赫尔斯霍夫已经开办了一座“应用化学与生物学”学校；在内政部帮助下复活起来的希特勒时代的所谓“民防协会”分发给它所有的工作人员一本题为“细菌战须知”的小册子。尼贝尔加尔最后说：“这一切都说明，那些好战的人在策动他们所渴望的新的严重事件中无所不用其极。”
