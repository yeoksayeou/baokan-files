Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 18th: All production factories and mines affiliated with the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company are universally launching a mechanization and automation campaign, learning from the small rolling mill. From February to now, according to preliminary statistics from twenty production units, a total of 993 proposals for mechanization and automation have been put forward. More than 100 of these have already been implemented, and 731 are being trialed after review and approval.

The initial development of this campaign has brought a new look to the transformation of old equipment in various factories, increased huge amounts of wealth for the country, and fundamentally changed the labor conditions for some workers. The automation of the steel turning machine and the "automatic gear" two important processes in the medium-sized rolling mill can increase the country's production by 200 million yuan per year. The riveting and hanging, picking and hanging and other operating procedures with poor working conditions in the steel pipe factory's pipe-making workshop have also been automated, which fundamentally eliminates the personal accidents that occurred in the past and saves 18 labor forces. The nail-making factory's calendering section created a surrounding plate to replace manual labor, and the output can be doubled. The automatic weighing machine created by the steel rope factory has increased production efficiency by four times. After the automation of the tube drawing machine in the thin plate factory, the automation of the rolling mill is being studied.

The mechanization and automation campaign launched by Anshan Iron and Steel Company proves that the mechanization and automation direction proposed by the small rolling mill is not only suitable for the rolling system, but also for smelting, casting, mining and other production units. At present, the workers in the "one selection" section of ore dressing have put forward more than 50 mechanization and automation suggestions. The automatic tube-bending machine successfully created by the casting pipe factory only requires two people to watch over it, which replaces the heavy operation of the original sixteen people. The ore truck hand-throwing machine in the iron-smelting plant has also been changed to mechanization.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 18th: The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company is training the first batch of female technical workers in basic construction. There are more than 200 female technical workers of various types who will soon appear on the construction site, more than 100 of whom are studying technical theory and preliminary technical knowledge in training classes, and the rest have signed apprenticeship contracts with old technical workers to learn technology in practical work. After six months of technical theory study and construction site practice, they will become junior technical workers in basic construction in such jobs as electric welding, surveying, electrician, lathe worker, and crane driver.

    鞍钢所属各生产单位普遍展开机械化自动化运动
    【新华社鞍山十八日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司所属各生产厂矿普遍展开学习小型轧钢厂的机械化、自动化运动。从二月到现在，据二十个生产单位的初步统计，共提出了机械化、自动化方面的建议九百九十三件。其中一百多件已经实现，七百三十一件经审查批准后正在试行。
    这一运动的初步开展，给各厂改造旧有设备带来了新的面貌，为国家增加了巨量财富，并使部分工人的劳动条件得到了根本改变。中型轧钢厂翻钢机和“自动挡”两个重要工序的自动化，每年可为国家增产两亿元。钢管厂造管车间劳动条件不好的铆挂、摘挂等操作工序也自动化了，这就根本消除了过去不断发生的人身事故，并节省了十八个劳动力。制钉厂压延工段创制了围盘，代替了人工，产量可提高一倍。钢绳厂创造的自动打磅机，生产效率提高了四倍。薄板厂的拔管机自动化后，正在研究轧钢机自动化。
    鞍山钢铁公司展开的机械化、自动化运动证明，小型轧钢厂提出的机械化、自动化方向，不仅适合于轧钢系统，同样也适合冶炼、铸造、矿山等生产单位。目前，选矿“一选”工段的职工已经提出了五十多件机械化、自动化建议。铸管厂创造成功的自动挠管机，只需两个人在一边看管，就代替了原来十六个人的笨重操作。炼铁厂的矿石车手摔机也改成了机械化。
    【新华社鞍山十八日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司正在培养第一批基本建设女技术工人。这批不久就要出现在工地上的各种女技术工人共有二百多人，其中有一百多人正在训练班学习技术理论和初步技术知识，其余的已和老技术工人订了师徒合同，在实际工作中学习技术。经过六个月的技术理论学习和工地实习，她们将成为基本建设中的电焊、测量、电工、车工、吊车司机等工种的初级技术工人。
