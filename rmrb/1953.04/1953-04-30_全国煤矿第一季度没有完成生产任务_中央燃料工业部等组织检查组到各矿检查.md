National coal mines failed to meet production targets in the first quarter. Inspection teams organized by the Central Fuel Industry Ministry and other departments will inspect various mines.

The national state-owned coal mines only completed an average of 96.1% of the state plan in the first quarter of 1953. Apart from Fushun, Jiaozuo, Yangquan, 401 and other ten mining bureaus that fulfilled their plans, the number of units that failed to meet their plans increased by one and a half times compared to the same period in 1952.

The phenomenon of uneven production in the first quarter was very serious. Nationally, production exceeded the plan by 1.1% in January, only reached 92.4% in February, and 94.1% in March. Looking at each ten-day period of each month, the trend was generally relaxed at the beginning and tense at the end. In the Central and Southern Region, the output in the last ten days of January was 28% higher than in the first ten days, and in the Southwest Region, the output in the last ten days of January was 90% higher than in the first ten days. The largest difference between the monthly output and the planned figure was at the Fengfeng Coal Mine, where the output in February was only 42% of the output in January. Other mines such as Jingxi, Tonghua, Xinwen, and Zibo also had large differences between months. Only Fushun, Benxi, Shuangya, and 401 mines had relatively balanced production. The main reason for the uneven production was that the leaders of the various mines did not pay enough attention to organizing balanced production. At the same time, February was the Spring Festival, and after the intense work in December of last year and January of this year, the workers had a mood of relaxation, resulting in a decrease in attendance rate and a reduction in output.

The situation regarding labor productivity in the first quarter was even further from the state's requirements. Only Jiaozuo, Yingcheng, and Luan mines exceeded their plans. The average labor productivity in each region only reached 87.4% of the plan. The Central and Southern Region was close to completion, reaching 98.9%, the East China Region reached over 94%, while the Northeast Region was below the average figure for each region. This year, the number of mechanized working faces increased, and according to the plan, more than 42,000 people should have been reduced, but these reductions were not made in a timely manner. On the contrary, due to unreasonable labor organization and low labor productivity, costs also increased.

Another important problem in production in the first quarter of this year was the poor quality of coal. In the Hongshan, Fangzi and Xin Zhuangzi and Cai Jiagang coal mines in Shandong and Huainan in East China, large pieces of gangue that had not been picked out were frequently found in the produced coal, with the highest ash content reaching 33%. Poor coal quality not only affected sales, causing stockpiles, but also greatly wasted transportation capacity. Although there was an improvement after strengthening picking, inspection, and spot checks in mid-February, this work cannot rely solely on temporary inspections and spot checks and must be carried out regularly.

Casualties also increased in the first quarter compared to the same period in 1952. The main reason for the increase in casualties was that the leadership's understanding of the safe production policy was not clear, and they simply pursued production quantity, leading cadres to violate safety regulations and operating procedures, neglect various systems, and relax labor discipline. These issues were criticized at the National Coal Mine Safety Production Conference this year, but the situation had not improved much by late March.

In order to change the serious situation of national coal mine production, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry and the Coal Mine Management Bureau have organized inspection teams composed of vice ministers, directors, bureau chiefs, and engineering and technical personnel to go deep into various mines to inspect and assist.

### 全国煤矿第一季度没有完成生产任务  中央燃料工业部等组织检查组到各矿检查

    全国煤矿第一季度没有完成生产任务
    中央燃料工业部等组织检查组到各矿检查
    全国国营煤矿生产一九五三年第一季度平均只完成国家计划百分之九十六·一，除抚顺、焦作、阳泉、四○一等十个矿务局完成了计划外，没有完成计划的单位比一九五二年同期增加了一倍半。
    第一季度生产不均衡的现象很严重。全国一月份超额完成计划百分之一·一，二月份仅达百分之九十二·四，三月份为百分之九十四·一。按每个月各旬情况来看，普遍是先松后紧。中南区一月下旬产量较上旬高百分之二十八，西南区一月下旬较上旬高百分之九十。每月产量高低距离计划数字最大的是峰峰煤矿，二月份产量仅达一月份的百分之四十二。其余如京西、通化、新汶、淄博等矿，月与月之间的差额都很大。生产比较均衡的只有抚顺、本溪、双鸭、四○一等矿。造成生产不均衡的主要原因是各矿领导方面对于组织均衡生产重视不够。同时，二月份适值春节，去年十二月及今年一月工作紧张，职工们都有松一口气的情绪，因而出勤率降低，产量减少。
    第一季度劳动生产率的情况距离国家要求更远。全国只焦作、营城、潞安三矿超额完成计划，各区劳动生产率平均只达计划的百分之八十七·四。中南区接近完成，达百分之九十八·九，华东区达百分之九十四以上，东北区则在各区平均数字以下。今年机械化工作面增多，按照计划应减少的四万二千多人，但都未能及时减掉。相反的，由于劳动组织不够合理，劳动生产率低，成本也因而提高了。
    今年第一季度生产中的另一个重要问题是煤的质量很差。华东区山东的洪山、坊子和淮南的新庄子、蔡家岗等煤矿生产的煤里面，经常发现未拣出的大块矸石，最高灰分曾达百分之三十三。由于煤质不好，不仅影响销售，造成积压，也大大浪费了运输力量。在二月中经过加强拣选、检验和抽查，虽已有改进，但这一工作不能只靠临时的检验抽查，必须经常进行。
    第一季度伤亡事故也比一九五二年同期增加。造成伤亡事故增加的原因，主要是由于领导方面对安全生产方针的认识不明确，单纯追求生产数量，以致干部带头违反保安规程、操作规程，玩忽各种制度，劳动纪律松懈。今年全国煤矿安全生产会议上对这些问题都已批判过，但到三月下旬情况还没有多大好转。
    为改变全国煤矿生产的严重情况，中央燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局已由副部长和司、局长及工程技术人员组织成检查组，深入各矿检查、帮助。
