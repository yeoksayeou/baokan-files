Abstracts of Soviet Press Articles

    **The Party's Leadership of Socialist Competition**

    The "Pravda" published an article on April 3rd by Kitov, Secretary of the Ivanovo Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, entitled "The Party's Leadership of Socialist Competition." The abstract is as follows:

    Socialist competition is a truly popular movement, and it always generates many new and advanced things. One of the most important tasks of Party organizations is to pay attention to and support the initiatives of advanced individuals in a timely manner, and to widely disseminate their experiences so that they become the common asset of all workers.

    Most Party organizations have learned to work with innovators, but the work of promoting their methods is poorly done. This is because Party organizations and enterprise leaders only create the necessary conditions for a few Stakhanovite workers and encourage them, but forget to formulate well-considered plans for all staff members and fail to pay attention to every worker in the enterprise.

    Party organizations should not only learn to work with advanced workers, but also learn to work with all staff members. Only in this way can the overall improvement of enterprise work be achieved.

    When supporting production innovators, the Party Oblast Committee should first support them by disseminating their work experience.

    The Party Committee should frequently discuss various issues related to leading socialist competition. The Party Committee should organize training courses for secretaries of Party organizations to exchange work experience on leading socialist competition. In addition, the Party Committee should guide trade unions and the Communist Youth League to actively participate in leading socialist competition.

    **The Plan and Potential of Industrial Production**

    "Pravda" published an article on April 5th by Kiunov, a Master of Economics, pointing out the importance of planning in industrial production. The abstract is as follows:

    The Soviet planning agencies are constantly improving planning work. This can be illustrated by the remarkable achievements of Soviet economic development, the rational allocation of productive forces, and the proximity of industry to raw material producing areas and consumer areas. The Soviet national economy is developing rapidly, and it is becoming very complex. Therefore, it is important to master the art of utilizing all material, financial, and labor resources in a planned and rational manner. What is particularly needed is to improve not only departmental plans, but also regional plans.

    In their practical activities, planning agencies do not pay enough attention to the overall development of economic regions, especially the overall development of large industrial hubs in oblasts and districts. Taking Molotov Oblast as an example, investment in the economy has increased more than threefold compared to pre-war levels, while the production of building materials has only expanded by less than twofold. The production of building materials is clearly not keeping up with the needs of capital construction; moreover, many enterprises producing building materials have their own administrative departments, and they only care about supplying their own construction projects, paying little attention to the interests of the entire oblast. In addition, Molotov Oblast possesses a wide variety of machinery and equipment, but the repair base is very weak. Furthermore, due to serious shortcomings in regional planning, Molotov Oblast also experiences a large amount of inter-transfer of materials. Planning agencies have not unified the activities of various departments within the same economic region.

    The basic method in socialist planning is the method of balance. The entire activity of our country's economic construction confirms the importance and necessity of balance and mutual coordination. In order to improve regional planning, planning agencies should not only prepare plans for the most important economic regions, but also prepare plans for individual administrative departments and large industrial areas when compiling balance sheets of production and consumption. This will eliminate unreasonable long-distance transportation and allow for fuller utilization of production capacity and enterprise potential.

    When compiling economic development plans, it is necessary to involve local Soviets and Party organs. The experience and suggestions of local workers are very valuable. This can better take into account local resources.

    In order to improve plans compiled by economic region, administrative department, and large industrial center, it is necessary to enhance the role of local planning agencies. Currently, their task is limited to compiling plans for economic organizations under local jurisdiction. It is very appropriate to have local planning agencies participate in the compilation of development plans for enterprises under the jurisdiction of the entire Union and the Republic, and to supervise the implementation of these plans.

    **Constantly Improving Product Quality**

    "Izvestia" published an article on April 7th by Rusak, Secretary of the Chelyabinsk City Party Committee of the Soviet Union, entitled "Constantly Improving Product Quality." After explaining the achievements of various enterprises in Chelyabinsk, the author pointed out the phenomenon of many defective products in some enterprises in the city, and focused on analyzing the reasons for the generation of defective products. The abstract is as follows:

    Practice has proven that many low-quality products and defective products always occur in enterprises that violate the principles of socialist operation and lack due attention to the high development of production levels. Taking a mechanical factory of the Soviet Ministry of Power Stations and Electrical Industry as an example, a large number of returns and requests for compensation are usually caused by products produced at the end of the month, that is, during days of crash work. This fact once again proves how much harm is caused to production by violating chart operations, not implementing balanced production throughout the month, and then rushing work.

    In Chelyabinsk, the phenomena of low product quality and failure to complete plans still occur in enterprises where the economic leaders, Party, and trade union organizations have not overcome the formalistic and campaign-style leadership of socialist competition. They pay little attention to promoting advanced experience and do not give necessary support to production innovators. The quantity of inferior products is directly dependent on the discipline in the technical operation process, the number of skilled workers in the technical supervision department, and whether advanced supervision methods are adopted. As experience shows, the decline in product quality is often due to the fact that enterprise leaders do not take the necessary measures to prevent the generation of defective products, do not care about improving the production skills of workers, do not organize the repair of machines well, and take a liberal attitude towards those who violate national standards and technical conditions.

    In many enterprises, the creative initiative of rationalization proposers and inventors is rarely guided to solve problems related to improving product quality. The review and adoption of suggestions is carried out slowly.

    The laboratories of some factories, the scientific and technological committees of enterprises, and universities are rarely involved in research to further improve production technology and in formulating methods to eliminate the causes of defective products. The exchange of production technology experience between enterprises with similar characteristics is also not organized seriously.

    The various factories in Chelyabinsk must mobilize the working masses to improve the above-mentioned shortcomings, and especially strengthen attention to technical supervision, so that each supervisor can take the prevention of defective products as their most important responsibility, rather than being limited to registering defective products.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    党对社会主义竞赛的领导
    “真理报”四月三日发表苏联共产党伊万诺沃州委会书记基托夫以“党对社会主义竞赛的领导”为题的论文。摘要如下：
    社会主义竞赛是真正的人民的运动，它总是产生许多新的，先进的事物。党组织最重要的任务之一，就是适时地注意和支持先进者的倡议，广泛地传播他们的经验，使之成为全体工人的财产。
    大多数的党组织都学会了进行对革新者的工作，但是，推广他们的工作方法这件工作却作得很坏。这就是因为党组织、企业的领导者只是为少数的斯塔哈诺夫工作者创造了必要的条件，并且鼓舞他们，然而却忘记了为全体工作人员制定经过思考的方案，没有注意到企业中的每个工作人员。
    党组织不仅应当学会进行对先进工作者的工作，而且也要学会进行对全体工作人员的工作。只有以这种方法才能达到企业工作的总的提高。
    党的州委会在支持生产革新者时，首先要以传播他们的工作经验的方法来支持他们。
    党委会要时常讨论有关领导社会主义竞赛的各种问题。党委会要组织党组织的书记的讲习班，交流关于领导社会主义竞赛的工作经验。此外，党委会要引导职工会和青年团积极参加领导社会主义竞赛的工作。
    工业生产的计划和潜力
    “真理报”四月五日刊载了经济学硕士基乌诺夫所写的一篇论文，指出计划性在工业生产中的重要。摘要如下：
    苏联的计划机关不断改善着计划工作。这可以由苏联经济发展的卓越成就，由生产力的合理配备，由工业靠近原料产地和消费地区来说明。苏联国民经济在快速发展着，它变得很复杂了。因此，掌握按计划地和合理地利用一切物质、财政和劳动资源的艺术，是很重要的。特别需要的是，不仅要使部门的计划，而且也要使地区的计划完善起来。
    计划机关在其实践活动中，对于经济地区的全盘发展问题，特别是对于州和区大工业枢纽的全盘发展问题，注意的还是不够。以莫洛托夫州为例，经济中的投资较战前增加了两倍以上，而建筑材料的生产只扩大了不到一倍。建筑材料的生产显然赶不上基本建设的需要；而且许多生产建筑材料的企业各有自己的管辖部门，它们只关心供应自己的建设，很少关心全州的利益。此外，莫洛托夫州拥有很多各种的机器设备，但是修理基地却非常薄弱。还有，由于在地区计划方面的严重缺点，莫洛托夫州还存在有物资大量互相转运的情况。计划机关没有把同一经济地区内的各部门的活动统一起来。
    社会主义计划中的基本方法就是平衡的方法。我国经济建设的全部活动都证实了平衡和相互间的协调的重要性和必需性。为了改善地区的计划，计划机关在编制生产和消费的平衡计划时，不仅要编制最重要的经济地区的计划，而且还要编制个别的行政部门和大工业区的计划。这样即可消除不合理的远程运输，可以更充分地利用生产能力和企业的潜力。
    在编制经济发展计划时，必须吸收当地苏维埃和党的机关参加。地方工作者的经验和建议是非常珍贵的。这可以更好地考虑到地方资源。
    为了改善按经济地区、行政部门和大工业中心所编制的计划，必须提高地方计划机关的作用。现在，它们的任务是只局限于编制那些归地方管辖的经济机关的计划。使地方计划机关参加编制全联盟和共和国所辖企业的发展计划，并监督这些计划的执行情况，是非常适当的。
    不断地提高产品质量
    “消息报”四月七日发表了苏联车里雅宾斯克市党委会书记鲁萨克以“不断地提高产品质量”为题的文章。作者在说明车里雅宾斯克市各企业的成就后，指出该市一些企业废品较多的现象，并着重分析了产生废品的原因。摘要如下：
    实践证明，许多质量低劣的产品和废品，总是发生在违反社会主义经营原则，对生产水平的高度发展缺乏应有的注意的企业中。以苏联电站和电机工业部的一个机械工厂为例，大量的退货和赔偿损失的要求，通常是由在月底、即在进行突击工作的日子所生产的产品而引起的。这个事实又一次证明，违反按图表作业，在全月中不实行均衡的生产而后来赶工，所给予生产的害处是多么大。
    在车里雅宾斯克市，产品质量低和没有完成计划的现象仍在这样一些企业中发生：这些企业的经济领导人、党和工会组织还没有克服对社会主义竞赛的形式主义的和运动式的领导，他们很少注意推广先进经验，对生产革新者没有给予必要的支持。劣等产品的数量是直接取决于技术操作过程中遵守纪律的情况，取决于技术监督部熟练工作人员的人数和是否采用了先进的监督方法。正如经验所表明，产品质量的降低经常是由于企业领导人没有进行必要的措施来防止废品的产生，不关心提高工人的生产技术水平，没有很好地组织对机器的修理，对于破坏国家标准和技术条件的人采取了自由主义的态度。
    在很多的企业中，合理化建议者和发明者的创造积极性很少被引导来解决与改善产品质量有关的问题。建议的审查和采用进行得迟缓。
    一些工厂的实验室、企业的科学技术委员会和高等学校，很少被吸收参加进一步改善生产技术的研究，和拟制办法来消灭产生废品的原因。在性质相近的企业之间进行生产技术的经验交流，也没有认真地组织起来。
    车里雅宾斯克市的各个工厂必须动员劳动群众来改善上述缺点，尤须加强对技术监督的注意，使每个监督人员都能把防止废品作为自己最重要的责任，而不限于登记废品。
