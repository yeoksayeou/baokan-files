On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland

	Zhaoyuan County Further Promotes New Farming Methods
	Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, which won the national "High-Yield County" award in 1952, will further promote new farming methods this year on the basis of last year, in order to support national construction with greater harvests.
	Last year, Zhaoyuan County promoted the farming methods of "equal-distance wide sowing, thinning and seedling protection, and phased topdressing" on more than 20% of the cultivated land, creating an advanced model of large-scale high yield. This year, the county proposed the policy of "universal mobilization, key promotion" of this new farming method, planning to create 5,000 *hectares* (equivalent to 15 *mu* per *hectare*) of high-yield fields, 1,000 high-yield mutual aid teams, and 40 high-yield villages throughout the county, each producing 10,000 *jin* of grain.
	In order to ensure the realization of the above plan, the Party and government leading organs at all levels in Zhaoyuan County have been conducting extensive ideological mobilization among rural cadres and farmers since last winter, improving confidence in increasing production and preventing the tendency of being greedy and careless. The Zhaoyuan County People's Government has successively held five technical training classes, training a total of 1,594 technical extension workers. The county has also universally rectified mutual aid teams and mobilized women to participate in production to adapt to the need for organizing more labor to promote new farming methods. At the same time, this year's manure preparation work has greatly exceeded previous years. The Zhaoyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation has prepared 1.14 million *jin* of manure and a large amount of blood bubble fertilizer, bean cake fertilizer, ammonium sulfate, and other fertilizers, and plans to purchase another 2 million *jin* of manure from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This year, the area of cultivated land applied with base fertilizer in the county will reach 60% to 70%, and the average amount of base fertilizer applied per *hectare* will increase by 16,000 *jin* compared with last year. Improved agricultural implements used to implement new farming methods have been mostly manufactured and are now being loaned to farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

	Shanghai No. 2 Textile Factory Completes First Quarter Plan
	The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory has completed its first quarter production task ahead of schedule. Cotton yarn exceeded the quarterly plan by 5.29%, and cotton cloth exceeded the plan by 0.18%.
	The reason why the factory exceeded its first-quarter production target was mainly because the factory leadership attached importance to educating employees on the concept of planning. Groups and individuals had specific measures for planning and ensuring the completion of the plan, solving some difficult problems in production. Secondly, it was due to the establishment of a responsibility system, which stipulated the responsibilities of functional departments, workshops, factory directors, as well as the planning department and finance department. For example, the planning department regularly reported the implementation of the plan by each workshop to each workshop on the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th of each month, and raised production problems to draw the attention of each workshop; after the 20th, it reported daily. The Party committee grasped and checked the overall situation of plan implementation based on various reports from the planning department and finance department.
	In addition, the factory also established a mass system for checking the implementation of the plan. In addition to the factory and workshops conducting regular monthly checks on the plan, each group also checked the implementation of the plan by individuals and groups once a week. During the checks, criticism and self-criticism were carried out to supervise each other and improve shortcomings in work. This is also a reason for the successful completion of the plan.

	First Sleeper Preservation Factory Under Construction
	In the well-known timber distribution center in the Yangtze River basin—the Parrot Island area of Hanyang, China's first large-scale railway sleeper preservation factory—the Hanyang Railway Sleeper Preservation Factory is under intensive construction. The civil construction of seven factory buildings, including sleeper steaming rooms, workshops, and boiler rooms, and the 14 track projects for transporting sleepers were basically completed by the end of last year. The factory also has water-making equipment projects such as water towers, sedimentation tanks, and filtration tanks, and a sleeper yard that can store hundreds of thousands of sleepers. Now, more than a thousand construction workers are continuing to carry out the earthwork project of the sleeper yard, the sewer project, and the cement pier project for stacking sleepers. Staff dormitories are also under construction. Machines customized in Shanghai are being contacted for transportation to the construction site, and the installation of some machines will begin in April. The entire project is expected to be completed in October.
	In the past, the sleepers used by China's railways were not steamed, and they were easily corroded. Each sleeper could only be used for three to five years. After being dried in the open air and steamed with preservatives, the sleepers have the properties of preventing natural disasters such as water immersion and insect infestation. Each such sleeper can be used for fifteen to twenty years. After the Hanyang Railway Sleeper Preservation Factory is completed, it can produce a large number of preserved sleepers to meet the needs of China's railway construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

	A Group of Female Construction Workers
	The basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company recruited 220 female construction apprentices in January and February of this year. These female apprentices were assigned to various engineering companies and technical supervision departments, including metal structures, mechanical installation, electrical installation, and the first civil engineering company. Among them, there are 77 electric welding apprentices, 20 surveying apprentices, and 20 electrical apprentices, as well as five other types of apprentices. Now they are all studying technology intensively, and they can go to the site for internships in a month.
	Since October last year, the Housing Engineering Department of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau has successively recruited more than 90 female workers to learn various construction techniques. At first, they encountered some difficulties. Some trembled when they picked up the large shears for shearing sheet metal; some applied red lead unevenly. However, when they thought that New China already had female drivers, female tractor drivers, and female pilots... they increased their courage to overcome difficulties. After only four months of study, they have learned the technology that apprentices used to need two or three years to learn. The male workers also enthusiastically helped them learn, disassembling the pump machines one by one, drawing drawings, and teaching them how to repair them. Now they can operate them skillfully.
	A painting team composed of fifteen female workers appeared in Wuxi City. After six months of hard study and practice, they learned wall painting techniques; on one construction site, they completed the painting task of more than 400 buildings seven days ahead of schedule. Now they are working enthusiastically with male workers on the Qishuyan workers' dormitory construction site.

	Actively Support Basic Construction
	The trade, cooperation, transportation, and other departments in Liaoyang City criticized the idea that "basic construction has nothing to do with us" and successively put forward plans to support basic construction. The Liaoyang Industrial Equipment Company has added four salesmen, who specialize in contacting various factories and mines and basic construction units in the city, and also plans to add ten purchasing agents and salespersons. The City Cooperative Federation decided to set up retail stores at larger construction sites; and implement a delivery system at smaller construction sites. The department store formed a basic construction materials supply team. In order to ensure that building materials are delivered to the construction site in a timely manner, the city transportation company transferred 124 carts and more than 20 automobiles, and decided to launch a transportation competition to improve transportation efficiency and overcome the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity. In order to cooperate with basic construction, the Construction Section of the Municipal People's Government has formulated a municipal construction plan. In order to solve the problem of vegetable supply for construction workers throughout the city, the Construction Section also plans to expand the planting area of vegetables.

	Cooperatives on Construction Sites
	Anshan City has established a consumer cooperative dedicated to supplying the daily life needs of basic construction workers. This consumer cooperative has dispatched service stations or mobile teams to each construction site. After joining the cooperative, employees participating in basic construction can enjoy the rights of members when purchasing goods at any service station or mobile team on any construction site. This method has been widely welcomed by the employees of each construction site, and many employees have joined the cooperative. On the first day of the cooperative's establishment, 500 workers joined the cooperative in just one unit.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    肇源县进一步推行新耕作法
    荣获一九五二年全国“丰产县”奖励的黑龙江省肇源县，今年将在去年的基础上进一步推行新耕作方法，以更大的丰收支援国家建设。
    肇源县去年在百分之二十以上的耕地面积上推行了“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”的耕作方法，创造了大面积丰产的先进范例。今年该县提出“普遍号召，重点推广”这一新耕作方法的方针，计划全县创造每垧（合十五市亩）产粮食一万斤的五千垧丰产田、一千个丰产互助组和四十个丰产村。
    为了保证实现上述计划，肇源县各级党、政领导机关从去冬以来就在农村干部和农民群众中进行广泛的思想动员，提高增产信心，防止贪多贪大、了草从事的偏向。肇源县人民政府先后开办五期技术训练班，共训练一千五百九十四名技术推广员。全县还普遍整顿互助组，发动妇女参加生产，以适应推行新耕作方法需要组织更多劳动力的情况。同时，今年粪肥的准备工作已大大超过往年。肇源县供销合作社联合社已准备好一百一十四万斤大粪和大量的血泡、豆饼、硫安等肥料，准备再从内蒙古自治区采购大粪二百万斤。今年全县耕地施基肥的面积将达到百分之六十到七十，平均每垧所施基肥可比去年增加一万六千斤。用来实行新耕作方法的改良农具，大部分已经制造好，现正在贷放给农民。　（新华社）
    上海第二纺织厂完成首季计划
    国营上海第二棉纺织厂已提前完成了第一季度的生产任务。棉纱超额完成全季计划百分之五点二九，棉布超额完成百分之○点一八。
    该厂超额完成第一季度生产任务的原因，主要是由于该厂领导上重视了对职工进行计划观念的教育，小组和个人都有计划和保证完成计划的具体措施，解决了生产上的一些困难问题。其次，是由于建立了责任制度，规定了职能科、车间、厂长以及计划科、财务科的责任。如计划科在每月的五、十、十五、二十日定期将各车间执行计划情况报告各车间，并提出生产上的问题，以引起各车间的注意；二十日以后，更每日做报告。党委则根据计划科和财务科的各种报表，掌握和检查执行计划的全面情况。
    另外，该厂还建立了群众性的检查执行计划情况的制度，除厂和车间每月定期检查计划外，各小组也每周检查一次个人和小组执行计划的情况，检查时展开批评和自我批评，互相督促，改进工作中的缺点。这也是使计划能胜利完成的一个原因。
    第一个枕木防腐工厂在兴建中
    在长江流域著名的木材集散地——汉阳鹦鹉洲地区，我国第一个大规模的铁路枕木防腐工厂——汉阳铁路枕木防腐工厂正在加紧兴建。枕木蒸制间、作业室、锅炉间等七个厂房的土木建筑工程和运输枕木的十四条轨道工程，已经在去年年底基本完成。这个工厂还有水塔、沉淀池、过滤池等制水设备工程，和可以堆积几十万根枕木的枕木场。现在一千多个建筑工人正在继续进行枕木场的土方工程、下水道工程和堆放枕木的水泥垛工程。职工宿舍也正在修建。在上海定制的机器正在接洽向工地运送，部分机器的安装工程将在四月开始。全部工程预计在十月完工。
    过去我国铁路用的枕木都没有经过蒸制，很容易腐蚀。每根枕木只能用三年到五年。经过露干，并用防腐剂蒸制以后，枕木就具有防御水浸、虫蛀等自然灾害的性能。这种枕木每根能用十五年到二十年。汉阳铁路枕木防腐工厂建成以后，就可以大量蒸制防腐枕木，供应我国铁路建设的需要。

    一批女建筑工人
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门，在今年一、二月份招收了二百二十名女建筑徒工。这些女徒工被分配到金属结构、机械安装、电气安装、第一土建等各个工程公司和技术监督处。其中有七十七名电焊徒工、二十名测量徒工、二十名电气徒工，另外还有其他五种徒工。现在她们都在紧张地学习技术，一个月以后就可以到现场实习。
    从去年十月起，华东建筑工程局工房工程处陆续招收了九十多名女工，学习各种建筑技术。开始时，她们碰到了一些困难。有的拿起剪白铁的大剪刀手就发抖；有的涂红丹涂得高低不平。但是，她们一想到新中国已经有了女司机、女拖拉机手、女飞行员……就增加了克服困难的勇气。经过短短四个月的学习，她们已经学会了过去学徒工需要两、三年才能学会的技术。男工们也热心地帮她们学习，把帮浦机一件件拆开来，又画好图样教她们怎样修理，现在她们已经能熟练地操作了。
    无锡市出现了一支十五名女工组成的粉刷队。她们经过六个月苦学苦练，学会了粉墙技术；在一个工地上，曾提前七天完成了四百多间楼房的粉刷任务。现在她们正在戚墅堰工人宿舍工地上，和男工们一道热情地劳动着。
    积极支援基本建设
    辽阳市的贸易、合作、运输等部门，批判了“基本建设与我们无关”的思想，相继提出了支援基本建设的计划。辽阳市工业器材公司增加了四名推销员，专门与全市各厂矿和基本建设单位联系，还准备增加十名采买员和营业员。市合作社联合社决定在较大的工地设立门市部；在较小的工地实行送货制。百货公司组成了基本建设物资供应小组。市运输公司为了保证把建筑材料及时送到工地去，调来一百二十四辆大车和二十多辆汽车，并决定开展运输竞赛，提高运输效率，克服运输力不足的困难。市人民政府建设科为配合基本建设，已经制订了市政建设计划。为了解决全市建筑工人的菜蔬供应问题，建设科还计划扩大蔬菜的播种面积。
    工地上的合作社
    鞍山市成立了专门供应基本建设职工生活需要的消费合作社。这个消费合作社向各工地都派出了服务站或流动小组。参加基本建设的职工入社后，在任何一个工地的服务站或流动小组购货，都可以享受社员权利。这个办法受到了各工地职工的普遍欢迎，很多职工加入了合作社。合作社成立的第一天，仅在一个单位就有五百个工人入社。
