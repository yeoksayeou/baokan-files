    US Soldiers Invading Korea Long to "Return Home Alive"
    Li Gao
    On the very day (March 28th) that Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai replied to Clark, agreeing to the prior exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war and suggesting that both sides immediately resume negotiations, American International News Service reporter Elegannt on the Western Front of Korea immediately collected reactions from American soldiers. Elegannt wrote:
    "Facing the communist army's captured Old Baldy Mountain, the American infantry, still shaken, put their helmets on their knees tonight and thought: 'Maybe we will finally leave here alive.'"
    In order to "leave here alive," the American soldiers in Korea are eager to stop the invasion of Korea immediately; they used to have various hopes for "leaving here alive," but all of their hopes have been broken one by one by their hawkish generals and government. American soldiers originally did not know "why they were fighting," and it was only Wall Street that drove them to Korea with laws, prisons, gallows, and pistols. The Korean War gave Wall Street high profits, but what did it give these American soldiers? The Eighth Army's chaplain said on New Year's Eve last year: "What the soldiers (American troops) got in 1952 was pain, despair, and disappointment. They watched their comrades being killed or crippled... They all know that future battles will bring more death, more destruction, and more despair." In such despair, American soldiers began to curse. American International News Service recorded the words of a US Army Sergeant Hargood: "I curse Korea, I curse the war, I curse the cold here... I seem to have my heart in two places. My body is here, my heart is at home. I have always been vigilant and careful to preserve my life."
    American generals seem to know something about the American soldiers' strong desire to "return home alive." Therefore, they often use the words "go home" to deceive their soldiers into selling their lives. The most famous is naturally MacArthur's amazing promise of "home for Christmas" more than two years ago. But what was the result? It was not the American soldiers who returned home, but only General MacArthur himself - although his return home was shameful, he was dismissed and returned home, but he did "return home alive" after all. When the current US President Dwight Eisenhower was competing for this position, he also won by playing the card of "ending the Korean War" and "withdrawing our troops from Korea." After this general grabbed the presidency, he went to Korea and indeed "returned home alive" safely, but the hope of Private Lidorf, who had been in Korea for twelve months, as described by the Associated Press reporter - "When Ike (i.e., Eisenhower) comes to Korea, I hope he can invite us all back to America" - turned into a bubble again. Thus, American soldiers had no choice but to "stay in bunkers huddled together along the vast white Korean front, waiting for the sentence they had been waiting for a long time, that is, 'rotation'" (International News Agency dispatch). If they are not killed before the "point" arrives, this is still a hope. However, the US Department of the Army increased the "rotation points" from "thirty-six points" and "thirty-eight points" to "forty points."
    Finally, American soldiers came to this conclusion: "Now you should know, never, ever trust the military." (United Press International, Korean dispatch, October 24th last year).
    Yes, "don't trust the military," it's more reliable to find your own way to "return home alive."
    Some smarter people thought: instead of thinking about how to "return home alive" after arriving in Korea, it's better to simply think about how not to go to Korea. The US Army's Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel, Lieutenant General McAuliffe, vaguely announced on January 7th this year that since the beginning of the Korean War, there have been 46,000 "real deserters" who have officially deserted in the US Army; and an average of 20,000 people per month use "unauthorized absence" to avoid being sent to the Korean battlefield. This number is equivalent to half of the number of recruits the United States recruits each month in the second half of last year.
    American generals certainly would not let American soldiers "return home alive" so cheaply. Relying on the United States' vast network of military police, police, and secret agents, it is said that "most" deserters have been caught and sent back, interrogated, sentenced to heavy penalties, and imprisoned. This is what the American "deserters" are happy with. Although they have to be punished and suffer, they have ultimately achieved the goal of "returning home alive." According to the "San Francisco Chronicle," many American soldiers deliberately went to the police on the street to cause trouble and create incidents before being sent to Korea, so that they could be arrested and imprisoned to avoid being sent to Korea. The newspaper said: "Local prisons are full of soldiers." But American generals are not stupid either. They came up with a more vicious method: after arresting deserters, soldiers who were "unauthorized absence" and "committed other crimes," they no longer sent them to be tried, but loaded them on the "first batch of ships" and escorted them to Korea to block artillery fire. According to the Associated Press, before January of this year, the US Sixth Army dealt with 1,512 soldiers in this way.
    Although the ropes and shackles of the American generals can escort American soldiers to Korea, they can never lock up their hearts that want to "return home alive." According to Judge Advocate General Ransfield of the US Eighth Army, the First Cavalry Division, the Second Infantry Division, the Third Division, the Twenty-Fourth Division, the Forty-Fifth Division, and all US troops in Korea have "a considerable number" of desertions. This trend of "desertion" cannot be stopped by the American officers' supervising pistols. On October 23rd last year, in a battle west of Kimhwa, even though the company commander of the 11th Company of the 31st Regiment of the US 7th Division fiercely pointed a pistol at their soldiers, 23 people still ran away, risking the "military law" of "immediate execution." They once sentenced 92 Puerto Rican officers and soldiers of the 65th Regiment of the US Third Division, who were accused of desertion, to heavy sentences ranging from six months to ten years. But it didn't help much. Recently, Major General Frey, commander of the US Second Division, came out with a suggestion. His method is to send military police to set up a "line to intercept deserters" behind the position during combat, "detain" the captured deserters, revoke their ranks, remove their armbands, and then escort them to the forefront to "redeem themselves" (United Press International dispatch, January 28th).
    In addition to "escaping," American soldiers have also come up with many ways to increase the chances of "returning home alive," such as self-injury, taking poison to make themselves sick, feigning madness, deliberately committing crimes... and so on. According to an American "expert" and American "Collier's" magazine reporter Bill Davidson's investigation (and discussions with many officers and scientists and military historians of the US military), they believe that half, perhaps more than half, of the US soldiers in Korea do not fire their guns in battle. Davidson said that he visited many junior officers of the US military in Korea, and they were extremely distressed by this problem, because they had to repeatedly expose themselves during combat, from one foxhole to another, to force the soldiers under his command to fire their guns. When "Collier's" magazine published Davidson's article on this issue on November 8th last year, it asked in large headlines: "Why Don't Half of Our Frontline Soldiers Fire?" This question may seem funny to American soldiers. The answer is simple: it's to "return home alive." "Not firing a gun" in combat means that he can lie prone on the ground in the trenches, not only does he not have to stick his head out to be a target, but he can also reduce the chance of attracting a "rain" of shells. The chances of these soldiers "returning home alive" are naturally higher than those of the fools who "fire their guns."
    However, even though American soldiers have tried every means to "return home alive," if the Korean War does not stop, they will continue to die by the thousands on the Korean battlefield. Since Clark interrupted the truce talks in early October last year, American soldiers have encountered more terrible deaths time and time again on Triangle Hill, "T-Bone Hill," "Old Baldy Mountain," and "Vegasy Hill." United Press International described the tragic situation of American soldiers after the battle of "Vegasy Hill" on March 29th:
        "The place was covered with shell casings and mortar fragments, and many shattered equipment and wounded and dead soldiers lay scattered on the ground.
    "There were piles and piles of bloody bandages removed from the wounded, damaged weapons, abandoned helmets, and ammunition belts.
    "A man stood there crying, then turned to look at Vegasy Hill and said: 'They are all dead. All my friends are dead.' He hid in a blown-up bunker, covering his face with his hands."
    This American soldier who "covered his face with his hands" and sobbed uncontrollably must be happy to hear about the efforts made by the Chinese and Korean people to promote a Korean armistice and seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, because this is in line with their most personal interests. As long as this war stops, they can truly "return home alive."

### 侵朝美军士兵渴望“活着回家”

    侵朝美军士兵渴望“活着回家”
    李高
    金日成元帅和彭德怀将军答复克拉克，同意在战争期间先行交换病伤战俘，并建议双方立即恢复谈判的信件刚刚发出的那一天（三月二十八日），在朝鲜西线的美国国际新闻社记者埃勒根特马上就去收集了美国士兵的反应。埃勒根特写道：
    “面对共军占据的老秃山的惊魂未定的美国步
    兵，今晚把他们的钢盔放在膝上想道：‘也许我
    们将终于活着离开这里。’”
    为了“活着离开这里”，在朝鲜的美国士兵们是渴望着立即停止侵朝战争的；他们过去曾经对“活着离开这里”有过各种不同的希望，但所有的希望都一个一个被他们的好战的将军们和政府打破了。美国士兵本来不知道“为何而战”，只是华尔街用法律、牢狱、绞索和手枪才把他们驱赶到了朝鲜的，朝鲜战争给了华尔街以高额利润，但它给了这些美国士兵们什么呢？第八军的随军牧师去年除夕说：“战士们（美军）在一九五二年所得到的是痛苦、绝望和失望。他们眼看着伙伴们被击毙或者被打成残废。……他们都知道将来的战斗还要有更多的死亡，更多的破坏和更多的绝望。”在这样的绝望当中，美国士兵们咒骂起来了。美国国际新闻社记录一个美军上士哈古德的话说：“我咀咒朝鲜，我咀咒战争，我咀咒这里的寒冷……我好像心挂两地。身在这里，心在家里。我向来都很机警，注意保全我的生命。”
    美国士兵这种强烈的渴望“活着回家”的念头，美国将军们似乎也知道一些。所以，他们经常用
    “回家”这两个字来骗诱他们的士兵去卖命。最闻名的自然要算麦克阿瑟在两年多前的惊人诺言“圣诞节回家”了。但结果怎样呢？回了家的不是美军士兵，而只有麦克阿瑟将军自己——尽管他的回家很丢脸，是撤职免官回去的，但总算是“活着回家”了。当现任的美国总统艾森豪威尔在竞争这个职位的时候，他也是靠打着“结束朝鲜战争”、“把我们的大兵从朝鲜撤回来”的招牌才抢到手的。这位将军把总统抢到手之后，到过朝鲜一趟，自己的确也平平安安地“活着回家”了，但美联社记者所描述的在朝鲜呆了十二个月的上等兵利道夫的希望——“当艾克（即艾森豪威尔）来朝鲜时，我希望他能邀请我们都回美国去”——却又变成泡影了。于是，美国士兵们就只好“沿着白茫茫的朝鲜战线，呆在地堡里挤成一团，等待他们很久以来一直在等待着的一句话，那就是‘轮换’”（国际新闻社电讯）。假如到“点”之前不会被打死的话，这总还算是一个希望。可是，美国陆军部把“轮换点数”由“三十六点”、“三十八点”又增加到“四十点”了。
    最后，美国士兵们得到了这样一个结论：“现在你们该知道了，永远、永远不要信任军部。”（合众社去年十月二十四日朝鲜电讯）。
    是的，“不要信任军部”，还是自己想办法“活着回家”可靠些。
    聪明一些的人们想：与其到朝鲜后才想办法“活着回家”，倒不如干脆想办法不到朝鲜去。美国陆军部负责人事的助理参谋长麦克奥里夫中将在今年
    一月七日遮遮掩掩地宣布说：从朝鲜战争开始以来，美国陆军里面正式开小差的“真正逃兵”有四万六千人；而且每月平均还有两万人用“擅自离职”的办法来逃避被派往朝鲜战场。这个数目相当于去年下半年美国每月征兵人数的一半。
    美国将军们当然不会这样平安地让美国士兵们这样便宜地“活着回家”的。他们依靠美国庞大的宪兵、警察和特务网，据说，把“大部分”逃兵都抓回去了，把他们审讯，判处重刑，关进监狱。这倒是美国的“逃兵”们乐意的，尽管要受刑罚，吃苦头，但终究达到了“活着回家”的目的了。据“旧金山纪事报”说，许多美国士兵在被派赴朝鲜之前，故意到大街上的警察附近去闯祸肇事，让自己被捕并关在监狱里，以避免被派到朝鲜去。这个报纸说：“地方监狱里充满了士兵。”但美国将军们也不傻，他们想出了一种更毒恶的办法，把逃兵，“擅自离职”和“犯其他罪”的士兵抓起来之后，不再送去受审，而是装上“第一批船只”押解到朝鲜去挡炮火。据美联社报道，今年一月以前，美国第六军就这样处置了一千五百一十二名士兵。
    美国将军们的绳索和镣铐尽管能够把美国士兵押解到朝鲜，但绝不能锁住他们想“活着回家”的那颗心。据美军第八军的军法官兰斯菲尔德说：骑兵第一师、步兵第二师、第三师、第二十四师、第四十五师以及所有在朝鲜的美军部队，都有“相当多的”临阵脱逃事件。这种“临阵脱逃”之风，美国军官们的督战手枪也制止不住。去年十月二十三日在金化以西的一次战斗中，美军第七师第三十一团第十一连的连长，尽管恶狠狠地用手枪指着他们的士兵，结果还是有二十三个人冒着“立即枪毙”的“军法”跑掉了。他们有一次就把美军第三师六十五团的九十二个被控临阵脱逃的波多黎各官兵判处了六个月到十年的重刑。但也不大顶用。最近，美军第二师师长弗莱出来献策了。他的办法是在战斗时派宪兵在阵地后方布置一条“拦截逃兵的线”，把捉到的逃兵“拘留”起来，撤销他们的军阶，摘掉他们的臂章，然后把他们押解到最前哨去“立功赎罪”（合众社一月二十八日电）。
    除了“逃”之外，美国士兵们还想出了许多增加
    “活着回家”的机会的办法，如自伤、服毒药使自
    己生病、装疯、故意犯罪……等等。据一位美国
  “专家”和美国“柯里尔”杂志的记者毕尔·戴维
    逊的调查（并且是和美军的许多军官以及科学家、
    军事历史家们讨论过的），他们相信在朝鲜的美军士兵中有一半，也许一半以上，在战斗中是不放枪的。戴维逊说，他访问了许多在朝鲜的美军下级军官，他们都为这个问题异常苦恼，因为他们在作战时不得不一再暴露自己，从这个散兵坑到那个散兵坑，去强迫他部下的士兵放枪。“柯里尔”杂志在去年十一月八日登出戴维逊谈论这个问题的文章的时候，用大字标题发问道：“为什么我们的前线士兵有一半不开枪射击？”这个问题，在美军士兵看来也许是好笑的。这答案很简单，就是为了想“活着回家”。在作战中“不放枪”，这就意味着他可以把肚皮紧贴着地面躺在战壕底下，既不用伸出头去当靶子，也可以减少引来一阵“雨点似的”炮弹的机会。这些士兵“活着回家”的机会自然要比
    “放枪”的傻瓜多一些。
    但是，尽管美国士兵想尽了千方百计希望“活着回家”，如果不停止朝鲜战争，他们仍然会成千成万地在朝鲜战场上继续死去。自从克拉克去年十月初中断了停战谈判之后，美国士兵在上甘岭，在
    “丁字山”，在“老秃山”，在“织女星山”，一次又一次地遭遇到了更可怖的死亡。美国合众社在三月二十九日描绘“织女星山”战斗后美国士兵的凄惨情况说：
        “这个地方铺满了弹壳和迫击炮的碎片，许多
    破碎了的装备和伤亡的士兵杂乱地躺在地上。
    “那里有大堆大堆的从伤兵身上解下来的血污
    的绷带、损坏了的武器、被抛弃的钢盔和子弹带。
    “有一个人站在那里哭，然后回过头去看看织
    女星山说：‘他们都死了。我所有的朋友都死
    了。’他躲在一个已经被炸毁的地堡内，用手遮
    住脸。”
    这“用手遮住脸”在失声痛哭的美国士兵，听到中朝人民为促成朝鲜停战、谋求和平解决朝鲜问题所作的努力，自然是高兴的，因为这是符合他们最切身的利益的，只要停止了这个战争，他们就真正可以“活着回家”了。
