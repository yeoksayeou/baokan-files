National Population Survey and Registration Measures

Article 1: To prepare for the elections of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, to do a good job in voter registration, and to provide accurate population figures for the country's economic and cultural construction, a national population survey and registration will be conducted.

Article 2: The population survey and registration work will be organized by the people's governments at all levels through population survey and registration offices. At the central level, it will be composed of relevant departments such as the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Statistical Bureau, and will be presided over by the Ministry of Interior. At the provincial (city) level, it will be composed of relevant departments such as the Department (Bureau) of Civil Affairs, the Department (Bureau) of Public Security, and the Statistical Bureau (Division), and will be presided over by the Department (Bureau) of Civil Affairs. At the county, city-administered district, and non-districted city level, it will be directly presided over by the respective people's governments and composed of relevant departments. The population survey and registration offices at all levels will work under the leadership of the election committees at the corresponding level.

Article 3: All citizens of the People's Republic of China shall be registered.

Article 4: Population survey and registration shall be based on households:

    1.  Those who reside together as family members shall be considered as one household.
    2.  Single residents shall be considered as one household.
    3.  Those residing in units such as government agencies, organizations, schools, factories, mines, farms, cooperatives, companies, construction sites, workshops, stores, hospitals, nurseries, reformatories, shelters, temples, churches, and ships shall each be considered as one household based on their unit. However, branches of the aforementioned units, external dormitories, and families residing within the aforementioned units shall be established as separate households.

Article 5: Population survey and registration shall establish survey and registration stations based on the electoral districts of townships, towns, city-administered districts, and non-districted cities, adopting the method of household heads registering at the station. When necessary, the method of surveyors visiting households can also be adopted.

The survey and registration of the People's Armed Forces shall be uniformly handled by the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission.

The survey and registration of overseas Chinese shall be uniformly handled by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government.

The survey and registration of personnel in foreign embassies and consulates and Chinese people working in foreign embassies and consulates in China shall be uniformly handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government.

The survey and registration of students studying abroad shall be uniformly handled by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government.

Article 6: The time of 24:00 on June 30, 1953 (May 20th, Year of the Snake in the Lunar Calendar) shall be determined as the standard time for the national population survey and registration:

    1.  Areas that have conducted surveys and registrations before the standard time shall, within a few days after the standard time, correct the population figures according to the actual population situation at the standard time. That is: the population that has died, married out, or moved out after the survey and registration and before 24:00 on June 30th shall be canceled; the population that has been born, married in, or moved in after the survey and registration and before 24:00 on June 30th shall be registered and calculated.

If the new residence has already completed the survey and registration, a supplementary registration and report shall be made.

Article 7: The age of the population survey and registration shall be calculated uniformly according to completed years of age, with June 30, 1953 (May 20th, Year of the Snake in the Lunar Calendar) as the standard time for calculating age. Regardless of whether the survey and registration is conducted before or after the standard time, age shall be calculated from the date of birth to June 30, 1953. Those under one year old shall be filled in as "under one year old"; those who are one year old or older but under two years old shall be filled in as one year old, and so on.
