Self-Criticism of Our Errors in Severely Violating Financial Discipline and Exhibiting Antagonistic Sentiments Towards Inspections
    Ma Li, Director of the Finance Department of Hebei Provincial People's Government
    Zhou Zhengxin, Deputy Director

    Editor's Note: On February 7th, this newspaper exposed the fact that the Finance Department of Hebei Provincial People's Government had seriously violated financial regulations. On March 5th, this newspaper published a brief letter from Ma Li, Director of the Hebei Provincial Finance Department, accepting our criticism. Now, we are publishing excerpts from the written self-criticism of Ma Li, Director, and Zhou Zhengxin, Deputy Director, of the Hebei Provincial Finance Department.

    On February 7th, the People's Daily exposed our serious violation of financial regulations by accumulating and misappropriating large sums of central revenue for three years, and failing to earnestly implement the detailed rules for the implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations. Combining this with the current anti-bureaucratism, anti-commandism, and anti-violation of laws and regulations struggle, we organized all department cadres to study and discuss the People's Daily's criticism and inspected our work. We further revealed serious problems in our department such as chaotic accounts and failure to implement budget and final accounting systems, which made us feel even more responsible and our mistakes even more serious.

    We have seriously violated financial regulations and accumulated and misappropriated large sums of funds that should have been turned over to the central government. The main reasons for these errors are:

    First, we have serious departmentalism and localism, and lack an overall perspective. This is prominently manifested in the collection of industrial and commercial taxes and agricultural taxes. When higher authorities assigned tax tasks, we always bargained, blindly believing that the higher authorities assigned us too much. After the tasks were determined, we demanded to retain a portion of the over-collected revenue. During the collection process, we only paid attention to the amount of task completed, without actively supervising and inspecting the deposit into the treasury, pushing the responsibility of remitting funds to the central government to lower levels. We were more concerned about local revenue, and in order to control more grain and funds to solve the province's problems, we tried every means to get more money, squeezing and seizing whenever possible. To achieve the goal of asking the central government for money, we often selected eloquent cadres to entangle with the higher authorities, and sometimes even falsely reported situations and concealed inventory. Sometimes we were dissatisfied when the central government's appropriations were not timely. Under the domination of this kind of thinking, we had twice requested and obtained the central government's approval to retain 70 billion yuan of cotton sales proceeds in 1950. In fact, only 9 billion yuan was used, and the rest was transferred to the bank for interest income under the pretext of "higher-level appropriations." We were slow to remit funds when the central government asked us to do so, delaying for as long as five months. In the past, we even regarded this error of simply pursuing local financial revenue at the expense of violating financial discipline as a "good method." In terms of expenditure, we also had serious departmentalism and committed many errors.

    Secondly, there was a serious phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline in our work. We did not deeply study and understand the various regulations, instructions, and decisions of the Central Ministry of Finance, but were only satisfied with superficial understanding, and often emphasized difficulties in implementation, failing to earnestly implement them. This phenomenon was manifested in the implementation of the treasury system. Before the central government promulgated the treasury regulations, the province stipulated temporary reporting and remitting measures, which were approved by the central government for implementation (this was correct). However, when the central government promulgated the revised detailed rules for the Central Treasury Regulations in May 1951, we did not abolish this temporary reporting and remitting measure, and arbitrarily decided that other than industrial and commercial tax revenue, other items would still be subject to this temporary reporting and remitting measure. The Central Ministry of Finance had issued instructions twice before and after in 1951 to correct this practice, but we ignored them. There were many such errors.

    In addition, we belittled accounting work, and in this regard also demonstrated serious bureaucratic work style. Chaotic accounting and discrepancies between accounts and the treasury have been long-standing problems in the Hebei Provincial Finance Department for several years. During the "Three-Anti" movement, we also organized forces to check the accounts, but the purpose at that time was to investigate corruption, not to clarify the accounting statements.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, we remained oblivious to this extremely chaotic accounting. Last year, we did not conduct a single inspection of the implementation of the accounting system and the treasury system.

    Our errors in violating financial discipline are very serious. But even more serious is our extremely insincere attitude towards the inspection by the joint inspection team of the Central Ministry of Finance and the North China Finance Bureau, and even our antagonistic sentiments. We considered ourselves "loyal" to the higher authorities and "responsible" to the lower levels, believing that we had a "complete set" of financial management skills and had achieved "significant results" in our work. When we heard that the inspection team was going to inspect the issue of accumulating 100 billion yuan of industrial and commercial tax revenue, we felt that this was not the case. When the inspection team found that there was a backlog of agricultural tax revenue in the past, and that there was an accumulation of 2 to 3 billion yuan of industrial and commercial tax revenue at the beginning and end of each month last year, we thought that this was a "thing of the past." This blindly arrogant and self-righteous erroneous attitude is one of the main reasons for our extreme lack of humility and even antagonism towards the inspection.

    We lack a correct understanding of financial supervision and inspection work. We mistakenly believed that the inspection teams of the Central Ministry of Finance and the North China Finance Bureau were here specifically to "fix" us. When the inspection team compared the situation with us, we repeatedly emphasized objective reasons. We admitted to accumulation but not to misappropriation. Our unwillingness to face our mistakes greatly obstructed our path forward. In order to correct our mistakes, we are determined to do the following:

    (1) Send this self-criticism to lower-level financial departments for discussion. Through this study, we will comprehensively inspect the financial work of Hebei Province and expose all facts of violating financial regulations and financial discipline. We are willing to sincerely accept the criticism of all cadres to improve our future work.

    (2) In order to eliminate bureaucratic work styles and strengthen organizational discipline, we have decided to start with clearing and compiling the 1952 final accounts, conduct a thorough inspection and clearance of the financial revenue and expenditure of Hebei Province in 1952, and earnestly establish new accounts for 1953. Leaders are required to handle violations of financial discipline one by one. At the same time, organize all financial cadres to study the central government's financial policies, laws, regulations, and systems (especially the treasury regulations and accounting system) to ensure the earnest implementation of the "unified revenue and expenditure, decentralized management, three-level budget" system stipulated by the central government.

    (3) Strictly control the budget and strengthen accounting work. In order to achieve unified leadership and clear division of labor, it has been decided that one of the department directors will be specifically responsible for all specific work related to budget management, organize forces regularly to conduct in-depth inspections and provide assistance, and correct problems as they are discovered. At the same time, we must conscientiously strengthen the study of accounting business to improve the professional level of leadership.

    (4) Strengthen financial supervision work. We have now organized an inspection team to conduct inspections in Tangshan City. We have decided to focus on inspecting the financial departments of cities, special districts, counties, and towns in the first quarter, first rectifying the ranks of financial departments, "setting an example by first correcting ourselves." In the second, third, and fourth quarters, we will focus on inspecting the financial work of business units, capital construction, and factories and mines.

    (5) Promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, mobilize everyone to jointly do a good job in financial work, and give play to the initiative of all levels, departments, and especially all financial cadres, so that financial policies, systems, and standards can be mastered and supervised by everyone. We must earnestly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to continuously advance our work.

    检讨我们严重违反财政纪律与对检查有对抗情绪的错误
    河北省人民政府财政厅厅长  马力  副厅长　周政新
    编者按：本报二月七日揭发了河北省人民政府财政厅严重违反财政制度的事实；三月五日本报发表了河北省财政厅厅长马力接受本报批评的简短来信；现在再把河北省财政厅厅长马力、副厅长周政新的书面检讨摘要发表如下。
    人民日报在二月七日揭露了我们三年来大量积压和挪用中央收入款项，不认真执行中央金库条例施行细则，严重地违反了财政制度的事。我们结合当前正在开展的反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争，组织全厅干部对人民日报的批评进行了学习讨论，对工作进行了检查，进一步揭发了我厅账目混乱，不执行预算决算制度等的严重问题，使我们感到责任更加重大，错误更加严重。
    我们曾严重违犯财政制度，大量积压和挪用应该上缴中央的款项。产生这些错误主要的原因是：
    首先，我们有严重的本位主义、地方主义思想，缺乏整体观念。这突出地表现在对工商业税与农业税等的征收方面。在上级分配税收任务时，我们总是讨价还价，盲目地认为上级给我们分配的多；而在任务确定后，又要求超收留成；在进行征收时，则只注意完成任务的多少，而不积极地督促检查入库，把向中央解款的责任推给下级。我们对地方收入比较关心，为了多掌握粮、款，便于解决省里的问题，曾想方设法多要钱，能挤就挤，能抓就抓。为达到向中央要钱的目的，我们往往挑选能说会道的干部去和上级纠缠，甚至有时假报情况，隐瞒库存。有时中央拨款不及时，我们则有不满情绪。在这种思想支配下，对一九五○年的棉花变价款，我们曾两次请准中央留用七百亿元；实际上只用了九十亿元，其余的就以“上级拨款”为借口，转入银行生息。中央要我们上解款项，我们迟迟不解，拖延达五个月之久。我们过去还把这种单纯追求地方财政收入，而不惜违犯财政纪律的错误，认为是一种“好办法”。在开支方面，我们同样存在着严重的本位主义思想，犯了许多错误。
    其次，我们在工作中存在着严重的无组织无纪律的现象。我们对中央财政部的各项条例、指示、决定，没有深入研究领会，只满足于一知半解，在执行中又常常强调困难，不认真加以贯彻。这种现象表现在对金库制度的执行上。在中央没有公布金库条例以前，省就规定了临时报解办法，并经中央批准执行（这是对的）；但当一九五一年五月间中央公布了修订的中央金库条例细则后，我们并没有废止这种临时报解办法，并擅自确定除工商税收入外，其他仍执行这个临时报解办法。一九五一年中央财政部曾前后两次指示纠正这种作法，我们竟没有理睬。这样的错误还很多。
    此外，我们轻视会计工作，在这方面同样表现了严重的官僚主义作风。会计账目混乱，和表库不符，这是河北省财政厅几年来的老问题。在“三反”运动时，我们也曾经组织力量检查账目，但当时的目的是为了查贪污，不是为了弄清会计账表。
    “三反”运动以后，我们对这种极度紊乱的会计账目，仍然熟视无睹。去年一年，我们对会计制度、金库制度的执行情况没有检查过一次。
    我们违犯财政纪律的错误是很严重的。但更严重的则是我们对中央财政部、华北财政局联合检查组的检查表现极不虚心，甚至有对抗情绪。我们自认为对上“忠心”，对下“负责”，“理财管家满有
    一套”，工作“满有成绩”，听到检查组要检查我们积压工商税款一千亿元的问题，觉得没有这回事；当检查组检查出过去农业税款有积压现象，去年工商业税款每月月初月末都有二、三十亿不等的积压现象的时候，我们认为这是“过去的事”。这种盲目自大、自以为是的错误态度，是我们极不虚心甚至对检查产生对抗情绪的主要原因之一。
    我们对财政监察工作与检查工作缺乏正确认识。我们错误地认为中央财政部、华北财政局检查组是专门来“整”我们的。当检查组和我们对照情况时，我们一味地强调客观原因。承认积压不承认挪用。我们不愿意正视错误，这种恶劣行为就大大阻塞了我们前进的道路。为了纠正错误，我们决心做好如下工作：
    （一）把这个检讨发到下级财政部门进行讨论，通过这个学习，全面地检查河北省财政工作，揭发所有违犯财政制度财政纪律的事实。我们愿意诚恳地接受全体干部对我们的批评，以提高和改进我们今后的工作。
    （二）为了肃清官僚主义作风，加强组织性纪律性，我们决定从清理与编造一九五二年决算入手，把河北省一九五二年的财政收支，作一次彻底的检查与清理，认真建立一九五三年的新账。对于违犯财政纪律的行为，都要求领导上一一加以处理。同时，组织全体财政干部学习中央的财政政策、法令、条例、制度（特别是金库条例与会计制度），保证认真贯彻中央所规定的“统一收支、分级管理、三级预算”制度。
    （三）严格掌握预算，加强会计工作。为了作到统一领导、明确分工，决定厅长有一人专责掌握预算的一切具体工作，定期组织力量深入检查帮助，发现问题随时纠正。同时，我们要切实负责加强会计业务的学习，以提高领导业务水平。
    （四）加强财政监察工作。我们现在已组织检查组去唐山市进行检查；我们已决定在第一季度重点检查市、专区、县、镇的财政部门，先整顿财政部门的队伍，“作到正人先正己”。第二、三、四季度再着重检查事业部门、基本建设及厂矿的企业财务工作。
    （五）发扬民主、开展批评与自我批评，发动大家共同作好财政工作，发挥各级各部门特别是全体财政干部的积极性，使财政政策、制度、标准能为大家所掌握和监督。我们要认真掌握批评与自我批评武器，使我们工作不断前进。
