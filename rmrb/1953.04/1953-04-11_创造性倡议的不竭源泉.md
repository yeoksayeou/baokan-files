    The "Pravda" published an editorial on March 30, emphasizing that party organizations and economic leaders should fully support the inventions and rationalization proposals of production innovators. The following is a summary:

    Economic leaders, Party and trade union organizations in enterprises, should pay the closest attention to developing the movement for inventions and rationalization proposals, and to absorbing the broadest strata of the working people to participate in the struggle for technological progress.

    However, in many enterprises, the full importance of extensively developing the movement for inventions and rationalization proposals is clearly underestimated, and innovators' initiatives do not often receive caring support.

    Some factory directors and chief engineers of certain enterprises evade direct leadership of this undertaking, pushing all the work to the rationalization proposal and invention bureau.

    Insufficient attention to inventions and rationalization proposals is also manifested in the fact that adopted suggestions are often not implemented and not adopted in production.

    Leading the invention cause is the responsibility of the various ministries. They should always be concerned with ensuring that recognized inventions are adopted most rapidly and organize the extensive exchange of innovators' experiences.

    We must resolutely struggle against the phenomenon of treating inventions and rationalization proposals of production innovators with a bureaucratic attitude. The creative initiative of the working masses should receive full support from various public organizations and economic leaders. The efforts of innovators should be used to solve some of the basic tasks of improving technology faced by the national economy in the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    In terms of inventions and rationalization proposals, work styles and methods are diverse. It is necessary to improve the work of the technical offices of various enterprises and to hold lectures and reports on new technology issues and advanced production methods more frequently. Fully consolidating the creative cooperation between scientific personnel and production workers is of great significance for developing technical thinking in factories, mines and construction sites.

    创造性倡议的不竭源泉
    “真理报”三月三十日发表社论，着重指出党组织
    和经济领导者应以全力支持生产革新者的发明和合理
    化建议，摘要如下：
    经济领导者、企业中的党和工会的组织，对于开展发明和合理化建议运动，对于吸收最广大阶层的劳动人民来参加争取技术进步的斗争，应当给予最密切的关怀。
    但是，在许多企业中，对广泛开展发明和生产合理化建议运动的全部重要性显然估计不足，革新者的创举并不是常受到关怀的支持。
    某些企业的厂长和总工程师规避直接领导这个事业，把全部工作推给合理化建议和发明局。
    对发明和合理化建议的重视不足也表现于已采纳的建议常常没有实施，没有在生产中采用它们。
    领导发明事业是各部的责任。它们应当经常关怀于使已被承认的发明获得最迅速地采用，并组织革新者经验的广泛交流。
    对于以官僚主义态度对待发明和生产革新者的合理化建议的现象，必须作坚决斗争。劳动群众的创造性倡议应当受到各种公共组织和经济领导人的全面支持。革新者的努力应当用来解决国民经济在第五个五年计划中所面临的改进技术的一些基本任务。
    在发明和合理化建议方面，工作方式和方法是多种多样的。必须改进各企业的技术室的工作，更经常地举办有关新技术问题和先进生产方法的讲演和报告。全力巩固科学人员和生产工作者的创造性的合作，对于在各工厂、矿坑和建筑工地发展技术思想，具有重大的意义。
