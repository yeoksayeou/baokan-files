Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 10th: According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency on the 10th, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, accepting the mediation proposal made by the Soviet government on March 20th regarding the return of British civilians detained in North Korea to their home country, handed over seven individuals to Soviet representatives so they could return home. These individuals included former British Minister to Seoul, Vivian Holt; former British Vice-Consul to Seoul, George Blake; former First Secretary of the British Legation in Seoul, Norman Oven; former "Observer" correspondent in Seoul, Philip Dean; former British missionary in Seoul, Thomas Quilan; former Salvation Army Commander in Seoul, Herbert Arthur; and former British missionary in Seoul, Alfred Cooper.

These British civilians resided in South Korea before the war. During the war, they were detained by our side. Before their departure, they met with reporters from Pyongyang newspapers and the Korean Central News Agency, arranged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

In their statements to the reporters, they unanimously expressed deep gratitude for the humanitarian treatment they consistently received from the Korean government. Former British Minister to Seoul, Vivian Holt, said: "After returning to my country, I will report in detail to the British government and the British people about the humanitarian treatment we received from the Korean government and the Korean people during our time in North Korea." He also said: "After returning to my country, I must do everything in my power to quickly stop the bloody war in Korea and to achieve peace in Korea. I believe my future task is to further strengthen the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of our two countries."

Former Salvation Army Commander in Seoul, Herbert Arthur, said: The various preferential treatments given to us by the Korean government during the difficult war years are something I will never forget in my lifetime. When a reporter asked him about his feelings regarding the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residential areas in the rear of Korea by American warplanes, he said: "This is indeed a criminal act. I am pained by the American planes' wanton slaughter of non-combatant Korean children, elderly people, and women."

British "Observer" reporter Philip Dean said: "In North Korea, I saw simple people fighting for a happy life and freedom, and I saw the terrible destruction, terror, and disaster brought about by the atrocities of the Americans. I have come to a deeper and more profound understanding of how noble a treasure peace is for mankind. Therefore, after returning to my country, I will report the various facts I saw and felt in Korea, and I must do my best to fight for peace."

Former British Vice-Consul to Seoul, George Blake, said: British mothers and wives eagerly hope that their sons and husbands in Korea, especially those who have become prisoners of war, will return to their country as soon as possible.

Former First Secretary of the British Legation in Seoul, Norman Oven, said: I will explain the tragedy of war and the value of peace to all my relatives and friends in my country in order to end the Korean War as soon as possible. I believe that making more people aware of the true value of peace will also be a contribution to ending the Korean War.

Missionary Thomas Quilan, talking about the joint statement of the Korean and Chinese governments on the Korean armistice negotiations and the resumption of negotiations, said: "The news of the resumption of negotiations makes me feel infinitely happy. I sincerely hope that the Korean armistice negotiations will be successful soon and that peace will be realized in Korea."

    被释放的英国平民向朝鲜新闻界发表谈话
    一致感谢朝鲜政府给予的人道主义待遇
    【新华社平壤十日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社十日消息：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府接受苏联政府三月二十日提出的关于使被扣留在北朝鲜的英国平民返回本国的斡旋建议，将前英国驻汉城公使维韦安·霍尔特、前英国驻汉城副领事乔治·布莱克、前英国驻汉城公使馆一等秘书诺曼·奥文、前英国“观察家报”驻汉城记者菲利普·迪安、前英国在汉城的传教士托马斯·奎兰、前英国在汉城的救世军司令官赫伯特·阿瑟、前英国在汉城的传教士艾尔弗雷德·库柏等七名，移交给苏联代表使他们得以回国。
    这些英国平民，战争以前居留在南朝鲜。在战争期间，被扣留在我方。他们在启程之前，由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省的安排，和平壤各报及朝鲜中央通讯社记者会见。
    他们在对记者发表的谈话中对于朝鲜政府始终给予他们人道主义的待遇，一致表示深切的感谢。前英国驻汉城公使维韦安·霍尔特说：“我回到本国以后将对英国政府和英国人民详细地报告关于我们在北朝鲜的期间所受到的朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民的人道主义待遇”。他并说：“我回到本国后一定要为迅速停止在朝鲜的流血战争、为实现朝鲜的和平而尽一切力量。我认为我今后的任务是要进一步加强两国人民的友谊和互相了解。”
    前英国在汉城的救世军司令官赫伯特·阿瑟说：朝鲜政府在困难的战争时期给予我们的各种优厚的待遇，是我一生都忘记不了的。当记者问他对于美军飞机对朝鲜后方和平居民地区的狂轰滥炸的感想时，他说：“这确实是犯罪的行为。我对于美国飞机对非战斗员的朝鲜儿童、老人和妇女们肆行着的屠杀行为感到痛心。”
    英国“观察家报”记者菲利普·迪安说：“我在北朝鲜看到了为幸福的生活和自由而战斗的纯朴的人们，看到了美国人的暴行所带来的可怕的破坏、恐怖和灾难，我进一步深刻地认识到和平是人类的多么高贵的财产；因此，我回到本国以后将要报道我在朝鲜所看到的和感觉到的各种事实，我一定要尽我最大的力量为和平而战斗。”
    前英国驻汉城副领事乔治·布莱克说：英国的母亲们和妻子们热烈地希望着她们在朝鲜的特别是成为俘虏的儿子和丈夫早日返回本国。
    前英国驻汉城公使馆一等秘书诺曼·奥文说：我将为早日结束朝鲜战争而对本国的所有亲戚和朋友们说明战争的悲惨与和平的可贵。我相信，使更多的人认识到和平的真正价值也将是为结束朝鲜战争而作的贡献。
    传教士托马斯·奎兰谈到朝中两国政府关于朝鲜停战谈判的声明和恢复谈判的问题时说：“恢复谈判的消息使我感到无限高兴。我衷心地期待朝鲜停战谈判早日成功，在朝鲜实现和平。”
