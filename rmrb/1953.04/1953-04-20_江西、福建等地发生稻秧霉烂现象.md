Jiangxi, Fujian and other places have experienced rice seedling rot.

Since March, seed and seedling rot has occurred in many areas of southern China. In Xunwu County, Jiangxi Province, the amount of rotten seeds and seedlings accounts for 10 to 30 percent of the sown quantity in some places, and as high as 40 percent in others. In Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, 1,300 jin of seedlings rotted in Yanshan Township, Seventh District, 360 jin of seedlings rotted in Shuanggou Township, and 110 jin of seedlings rotted in five households in Xutang Village. Ten percent of the seeds rotted in Jiunan Township, Second District. Twelve households in Chunhu and Gudian Townships in the Fifth District also experienced seedling rot. In Dajiang Township, Zhaoping County, Guangxi Province, 20 to 25 percent of the seedlings rotted; in the Daqiao Township area of ​​Fuzhong County's Fifth District, half of the seedlings rotted. Rotten seedlings are also common in other places such as Mengshan and Gongcheng. According to investigations in various places, the main reasons for seed and seedling rot are continuous rainy and cold weather since spring plowing and sowing, and some farmers not being serious about seed selection and sowing bad seeds in the rice paddies, or the rice paddies not being made properly, and improper care during seed soaking. The county and district leaderships have paid attention to areas where the above situations have already occurred. For example, the Jinjiang County People's Government in Fujian Province, in addition to instructing all districts to conduct thorough inspections, has also dispatched cadres to conduct key inspections in four townships, mobilizing the masses to find ways to remedy the situation. The Xunwu County People's Government of Jiangxi Province dispatched Liu Chuanchang, head of the Construction Section, to Xinzhai Village in late March to hold a forum with farmers and worked out two effective remedial measures.

    江西、福建等地发生稻秧霉烂现象
    自三月份以来，江南许多地区，发生种籽、秧苗霉烂现象。江西省寻邬县各地霉烂种籽、秧苗，轻的占播种数量的百分之十到三十，重的到百分之四十。福建省晋江县七区雁山乡霉烂秧苗有一千三百斤，双沟乡烂坏秧苗三百六十斤，许塘村有五户烂坏秧苗一百一十斤；二区鹫南乡烂坏种籽有百分之十；五区春湖、古店两乡也有十二户秧苗烂坏。广西省昭平县大将乡，秧苗烂坏有百分之二十到二十五；富钟县第五区大桥乡一带烂秧达一半；其他如蒙山、恭城等地，也都普遍发生烂秧现象。发生烂种烂秧的主要原因，据各地调查，是因为自春耕播种以来，连日阴雨，天气阴冷，和有些农民在选种时不认真，把坏的种籽撒在秧田里。或是秧田做得不合式，浸种时照顾不好。在已发生以上情况的地区，已引起县、区领导上的重视。如福建晋江县人民政府，除指示各区普遍深入进行检查外，并已抽调干部深入四个乡作重点检查，发动群众，设法补救。江西省寻邬县人民政府，已在三月下旬派出建设科长刘传昌深入新寨村召开农民座谈会，研究出两个有效的补救办法。
