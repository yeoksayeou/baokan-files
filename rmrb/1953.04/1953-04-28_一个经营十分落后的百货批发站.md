    A Very Backward Operated Department Store Wholesale Station
    Communist Party of China Heilongjiang Provincial Committee Commercial Department

    The Suihua District Department Store Wholesale Station is responsible for supplying nearly 1.3 million people in six counties and one forest area, including Suihua, Hailun, Qing'an, Wangkui, Suiling, and Tieli. It is a relatively large wholesale station in Heilongjiang Province. Since its establishment in April 1951, it has played a considerable role in supplying people's livelihood materials, controlling the market, and stabilizing prices, but it is far from meeting the needs of the people's production and life development. There are still serious backward phenomena in its operation.

    Serious Out-of-Stock Phenomenon

    Out-of-stock has been a problem that the wholesale station has failed to solve over the years. This phenomenon was particularly serious in the fourth quarter of 1952. The past inventory of more than 2,000 kinds of goods has now been reduced to 800 kinds. Many major commodities, such as white coarse cloth, blue serge, colored checkered cloth, cotton hats, leather overcoats, and sugar, frequently or intermittently experience shortages. The Suihua County Department Store operates 2,400 kinds of goods, and 20% are often out of stock; the Qing'an County Department Store used to operate 2,000 kinds of goods, but now it has been reduced to 1,300 kinds; the Hailun Store even took down the publicity floral cloth and door curtains to sell. The wholesale station only completed 53% of its sales plan for the first quarter of 1953.

    Some commodities are stockpiled in the warehouse, but are out of stock in the retail outlets; some commodities are about to be out of stock, but they are blindly transferred out.

    This serious out-of-stock situation has not aroused enough attention from the leading comrades of the wholesale station. Some leading cadres even said, "We complete the task according to the plan every quarter, and the problem is that the plan is too small, which is a problem of the counties," "Although various product names have not been satisfied, the total planned amount has still achieved the task." They even pushed the responsibility for out-of-stock to other units: "The factory produces less, the railway transportation is slow, the supply is insufficient, and they do not try to solve it in time," "The cadres of the counties have ideas about famous brands and do not want the goods, so who is to blame for not completing the task?" In fact, the reason for this phenomenon is that the leading cadres of the wholesale station do not have a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of state-owned commercial enterprises being responsible for the market. Some managers said to the cadres below: "If you want to do a good job, you must sell as much as you get, and sell at the time, and do not keep inventory." Therefore, they do not actively organize purchases.

    The frequent out-of-stock of goods at the wholesale station has affected the supply to the people in various places, affected the completion of the plans of the county department stores, and caused adverse social effects. The sales units in various counties have a lot of opinions. In the fourth quarter of last year, only two kinds of cloth, black and white, were displayed on the counters of the stores in various counties. The masses said that they were "Black and White Company" and "Bai Que Company" (Hundred Shortage Company).

    The phenomenon of commodity backlog is also very serious

    The wholesale station has accumulated a lot of commodities, of which long-term backlog commodities account for one-fifth of the inventory amount, and many have been backlogged since the establishment of the wholesale station.

    The phenomenon of blind purchasing at the wholesale station is also very serious. For example, more than 7,000 dozen ping-pong balls were originally backlogged, and after only 500 dozen were allocated, another 504 dozen were transferred in; 9,000 children's trumpets have been backlogged, and another 3,000 were transferred in; in the fourth quarter, there were 500 boxes of chalk, and the manager thought it was not enough, so he asked for 7,000 boxes at the district company exchange meeting, and then actually allocated 1,500 boxes (including 300 boxes of colored chalk), which is enough for Suihua area to use for four years.

    In this case, some leading cadres still say indifferently: "We are a big family, it doesn't matter if we have a little backlog."

    Bureaucratic Work Style in Leadership

    The leading cadres of the Suihua District Department Store Wholesale Station have long had a serious bureaucratic work style. This is first manifested in not paying attention to the instructions of the higher authorities, and not studying the guidelines and policies. The manager and section chiefs sometimes do not even look at the documents sent from above. In the fourth quarter of last year, the higher authorities instructed that cotton should not exceed 4,800 yuan per catty, but the wholesale station still shipped it out of the warehouse at the original price of 7,200 yuan. When the county delivery personnel argued with the warehouse staff because of the price issue, they asked the manager, and the manager then rummaged through the accumulated documents in the drawer to find the basis. In the fourth quarter of last year, the district company instructed "In order to vigorously support national industrial construction, under the principle of improving business management, accelerating capital turnover, and ensuring supply, compress capital by 29 billion yuan." The leading cadres of the wholesale station did not study the spirit of the instructions, only focusing on compressing inventory. The manager said: "The funds are all backlogged in the inventory of goods. Let's sell some of the backlogged goods before we purchase more." The leading cadres of the wholesale station do not pay attention to the opinions of the lower levels, thus打击打击了群众的积极性。 The staff of the wholesale station reflected: "We have made enough suggestions, but what can we do if the leaders are not determined to solve them?"

    The leading cadres of the wholesale station have a very poor understanding of the people's needs and the production and sales situation. They never go deep into the grassroots to investigate the production and sales situation, but just sit at home and blindly direct, only satisfying the completion of the sales amount, regardless of the supply of specific varieties, resulting in both out-of-stock and backlog. The business section chief of Suihua County Department Store said: "I have been working for more than two years, and I have never seen the manager or section chief of the wholesale station come to us. Sometimes we rush to study the problem, but they don't solve it well." And the Suihua County Department Store and the Suihua Wholesale Station live in the front and back yards.

    Confusion in Business

    Leading cadres do not conduct investigations and research, and they have no idea in their minds. The plans they formulate are often divorced from reality. They often summarize the plans submitted by the counties and then balance them according to the indicators of the higher authorities, treating them as their own plans; they only care about completing the indicators of the higher authorities, regardless of the actual needs of the masses. They always follow the business, and their plans become statistics.

    Business personnel do not implement the plan, but are governed by the supply and demand situation of the market; they blindly purchase, blindly process, and blindly price. Financial accountants cannot reasonably use funds. They say: "We are only in charge of spending money. The backlog of goods and the out-of-stock in the market are the business section's business."

    In addition, the established system cannot be implemented, which also aggravates the chaos in business operations.

    Weak Political Work

    The political work of the wholesale station is weak. The Party branch has not played its due role in the enterprise. The Party branch lacks a strong leadership core. The branch secretary does not know the division of labor of the branch committee members, and the branch committee members do not know the number of Party members; the branch lacks serious struggle against various erroneous ideas, and does not criticize some Party members who have high positions but do not act in accordance with Party principles. Administrative leading cadres lack the idea of relying on all employees to do a good job in commercial work, do not mobilize the masses, do not specifically explain the tasks to the masses, and lack democratic atmosphere. The trade union and the Communist Youth League are not clear about the idea of relying on the leadership of the Party to do a good job. Their work plans and summaries are not submitted to the Party branch at all. They regard their relationship with the Party branch as only a contact rather than accepting leadership. The leadership of the trade union and the Communist Youth League is not sound, the activities are not regular, and the prestige in the minds of the masses is not high.

    The Party organizations in the Suihua area should strengthen their leadership over the wholesale station and quickly change this backward and chaotic situation.

    一个经营十分落后的百货批发站
    中共黑龙江省委商业部
    绥化地区百货批发站担负着绥化、海伦、庆安、望奎、绥棱、铁骊等六个县和一个林区的将近一百三十万人口的百货供应任务，它是黑龙江省较大的批发站。一九五一年四月成立以来，它在供应人民生活资料，掌握市场，稳定物价上起了相当作用，但还远不能满足人民的生产、生活发展的需要，它在经营上还存在着严重的落后现象。
    商品脱销现象严重
    商品脱销是该批发站历年来未能解决的问题。这种现象在一九五二年第四季度特别严重。过去库存二千多种商品，现已减少到八百种。许多主要商品如白粗布、青斜纹、色格布、棉帽、皮大衣、砂糖等，经常地或间断地发生奇缺的现象。绥化县百货公司经营二千四百种商品，经常有百分之二十脱销；庆安县百货公司过去经营二千种商品，现减到
    一千三百种；海伦商店曾把宣传用的花布和门帘摘下卖掉。该批发站一九五三年第一季度销售计划仅完成百分之五十三。
    有些商品在仓库中积压着，在门市却脱销；有些商品眼看要脱销，还盲目地往外调运。
    这种严重的脱销情况，还未引起批发站的领导同志足够的重视。有的领导干部甚至还说：“我们每季度都按计划完成任务，计划订的少是各县有问题”，“各种品名虽未满足，但总的计划金额还达成任务”。他们甚至把脱销责任推给别的单位：
    “工厂生产少，铁路运输慢，供应不足，不及时设法解决”，“各县干部有名牌货思想，有货不要，那怨谁完不成任务”。其实，造成这种现象的原因，是该批发站领导干部对国营商业应对市场负责的严重意义认识不足，有的经理对下边干部说：
    “要想工作作得好，就必须是来多少销多少，到点销点，不叫库存。”因此，他们就不积极组织进货了。
    该批发站的货物经常脱销，影响了对各地人民的供应，影响了县百货公司计划的完成，造成社会的不良影响，各县销售单位很有意见。去年第四季度各县商店柜台上只摆着黑白两种布，群众说它们是
    “黑白公司”“百缺公司”。
    商品积压现象也很严重
    该批发站积压了不少的商品，其中长期积压的商品占库存金额的五分之一，有许多是从批发站成立以来一直积压到现在的。
    该批发站盲目进货的现象也很严重。如乒乓球原积压七千多打，刚拨出五百打，又调来五百零四打；小孩喇叭已积压九千个，又调进三千个；第四季度原有粉笔五百箱，经理认为不足，又在区公司交流会上要七千箱，后实拨一千五百箱（内有三百箱色粉笔），足够绥化地区用四年。
    在这种情况下，有的领导干部还不关痛痒地说：
    “家大业大，积压点没啥。”
    领导上的官僚主义作风
    绥化地区百货批发站的领导干部长期存在着严重的官僚主义作风。这首先表现在不重视上级指示，不研究方针政策，上边发来文件，经理、股长有时连看也不看。去年第四季度上级指示棉花每斤不超过四千八百元，但批发站仍按原价七千二百元出库，当各县领货员因价格问题和仓库员争辩起来，问到经理跟前，经理才在抽匣里翻出积压的文件来找根据。去年第四季度区公司指示“为大力支援国家工业建设，在改善经营管理、加速资金周转、保证供应原则下，压缩资金二百九十亿元。”该批发站领导干部不研究指示精神，只顾压缩库存，经理说：“资金都积压在库存商品上啦，等把积压货销光些再进货吧”。批发站领导干部又不重视下级意见，因而打击了群众的积极性。批发站职工反映：“意见提的够一打了，领导不下决心解决有啥办法。”
    该批发站领导干部对人民需要和产销情况研究很差。他们从来不深入下层调查产销情况，只是坐在家里盲目指挥，仅仅满足于销售金额的完成，不管具体品种的供应，结果一面表现脱销，一面又表现积压。绥化县百货公司业务股长说：“我工作二年多了，从来未看见过批发站经理、股长到我们这里来过，有时我们赶去研究问题，都不好好解决。”而绥化县百货公司和绥化批发站就在前后院住着。
    业务上的混乱现象
    领导干部不进行调查研究，心中无数，制订的计划常常是脱离实际的。他们常常把各县交来的计划汇总起来，然后按着上级指标平衡一下，当成自己的计划；他们只顾完成上级的指标，不管群众的实际需要。他们总是跟着业务跑，他们的计划变成了统计。
    业务人员不执行计划，受市场的供求状况支配；盲目采购，盲目加工，盲目作价。财务会计不能合理运用资金，他们说：“我们就管支钱，商品积压、市场脱销，那是业务股的事”。
    此外，已建立起来的制度不能执行，也加重了业务工作的混乱现象。
    政治工作薄弱
    该批发站的政治工作薄弱。党支部在企业内没有起到应有的作用，党支部缺乏坚强的领导核心，支部书记不知道支部委员的分工，支部委员不知道党员人数；支部对各种错误思想缺乏严肃的斗争，对有些职位较高而不按照党的原则办事的党员不加批评。行政领导干部缺乏依靠全体职工办好商业工作的思想，不发动群众，不具体地向群众交代任务，十分缺乏民主空气。工会、青年团对依靠党的领导作好工作的思想也不明确，他们的工作计划、总结根本不交党支部，他们把和党支部的关系看成只是联系而不是接受领导。工会、青年团领导不健全，活动不经常，在群众心目中威信不高。
    绥化地区的党组织应加强对该批发站的领导，迅速改变这种落后混乱的状况。
