Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon: The "Burma People's Daily" recently published an appeal to the people of the world by the Patriotic League of Burma (including the Labor-Farmer Party, the All-Burma People's Party, and the People's Unity Party, etc.) regarding the invasion of Burma by the Kuomintang troops.

The appeal stated: "At the end of 1949, Kuomintang troops first invaded Burmese territory, violating the sovereignty of the Burmese people. By the end of 1950, they had occupied the border counties east of Kengtung and entrenched themselves there. By 1951, they had established a headquarters in Monghsat and occupied all Burmese territory east of the Salween River, except for the major cities. By the end of 1952, the entire area north to the counties of Myitkyina and Bhamo, south to Tavoy, and west to the Salween River, except for the major cities, had fallen into the hands of the Kuomintang troops."

The appeal pointed out: In the Burmese territory they occupied, the Kuomintang troops forcibly levied exorbitant taxes, appointed their own administrative officials, seized and exploited mineral resources, established military bases, built airports, plundered the people in the occupied areas, forced them to join labor teams and troops for hard labor, and raped women.

The appeal continued: It is now certain that American military officers participated in the Kuomintang troops' invasion. It is certain that the Kuomintang troops are equipped with the latest American weapons. It is also certain that Li Mi, commander of the Kuomintang troops, traveled several times between Taiwan and the Monghsat headquarters.

The appeal emphasized: These facts undoubtedly suffice to prove that the Kuomintang troops' invasion of Burma was for aggressive purposes, and that they deliberately seized and occupied Burmese territory.

We, the Burmese people, are against war and yearn for peace. We do not want Asia or any place in the world to become a battlefield. On the contrary, we hope that peace can be achieved in Asia and all other parts of the world. We oppose all deception. We want to work for peace and mutual understanding between all countries. We condemn all acts of aggression. We advocate national independence and unity. We do not want to see our land become a military base or a battlefield. We hope to live in a peaceful environment and engage in necessary peaceful construction.

Now, the Burmese army, people's armed forces, and victims who have been plundered and abused by the Kuomintang troops are waging a tenacious and resolute struggle against the Kuomintang aggressors. At the same time, the Burmese people, who are always united when facing a common enemy, are organizing a national united front to fight to finally drive the Kuomintang aggressors out of Burma.

The appeal demanded that the people of the world, governments of all countries, and all groups of all countries unanimously condemn: "(1) the Kuomintang troops taking aggressive action in Burma, (2) the government responsible for these troops, (3) the relevant governments that assist and incite them to carry out their aggression plans." The appeal also called for support for the Burmese people who are resolutely struggling to expel the Kuomintang aggressors.

The appeal concluded: "We implore the people of all countries to demand that their own governments and representatives to the United Nations support Burma when the United Nations discusses the issue of the Kuomintang troops' invasion."

    控诉蒋匪军在美国支持下侵入缅甸领土、侵犯缅甸主权
    缅甸爱国联盟向全世界人民发出呼吁
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社仰光消息：“缅甸人报”最近刊载了缅甸爱国联盟（包括工农党、我缅人党和人民团结党等进步党派）发表的为国民党军队侵略缅甸问题向全世界人民呼吁书。
    呼吁书说：“一九四九年年底，国民党军队第一次侵入缅甸领土，侵犯缅甸人民的主权。到一九五○年年底，他们占领了景栋以东的边境各县，并在那里挖壕据守。到一九五一年，他们在孟萨设立了司令部，并占领了萨尔温江以东除了大城市以外的所有缅甸领土。到一九五二年年底，北至密芝那县和巴约县、南至土瓦县、西至萨尔温江这一整片地区，除了各大城市以外，都落到国民党军队手里。”
    呼吁书指出：国民党军队在他们占领了的缅甸领土上，强征苛捐杂税，任命他们自己的行政官吏，夺取和开采矿产资源，建立军事基地，修筑飞机场，劫掠占领区内的人民，强迫他们加入劳工队和部队做苦工，并奸淫妇女。
    呼吁书接着说：现在可以肯定，国民党军队的侵略行动是有美国军官参加的。可以肯定，国民党军队是用最新式的美国武器装备起来的。还可以肯定，国民党军队司令李弥曾在台湾和孟萨司令部之间来往了好几次。
    呼吁书强调说：这些事实无疑地足以证明国民党军队侵入缅甸，是抱着侵略目的的，他们故意夺取和占领缅甸的领土。
    我们缅甸人民是反对战争、渴望和平的，我们不希望亚洲或者世界上任何地方变成战场。相反地，我们希望亚洲和世界上其他一切地方能够实现和平。我们反对任何欺骗。我们要为实现一切国家之间的和平与相互谅解而努力。我们斥责一切的侵略行为。我们主张民族独立和团结一致。我们不希望看到我们的国土变成军事基地或战场。我们希望生活在和平环境里，从事必要的和平建设。
    现在，缅甸军队、人民武装力量和遭受国民党军队劫掠和虐待的受害者都正在对国民党侵略者进行顽强坚决的战斗，同时在遇到共同的敌人的时候总是团结一致的缅甸人民正在组织一个民族联合阵线，为把国民党侵略者最后赶出缅甸而斗争。
    呼吁书要求全世界人民、各国政府和各国的一切团体一致谴责：“（一）在缅甸采取侵略行动的国民党军队，（二）对这些军队负有责任的政府，（三）协助和煽动他们进行侵略计划的有关政府”。呼吁书并要求支援为驱逐国民党侵略者而进行坚决斗争的缅甸人民。
    呼吁书最后说：“我们恳请各国人民都要求他们本国的政府和驻联合国的代表在联合国讨论国民党军队的侵略问题时支持缅甸。”
