Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 6th: According to the Polish Press Agency, Poland's power industry has developed rapidly. At the end of 1952, the national power generation per capita had increased more than threefold compared to pre-war levels. In the past two years, annual power generation has increased by more than 13 percent each year. Poland's largest hydroelectric power station, the Ludwik Waryński Hydroelectric Power Station (in Dychów Province), equipped with complete sets of new Soviet turbine equipment, generates three times the total power generated by all Polish hydroelectric power stations before the war. Currently, Poland is continuing to equip new generators and build new power stations with Soviet assistance. A new turbine at the Chorzów Power Station in Stalinogród Province recently started operation, and its power is sufficient to supply the needs of two large coal mines. Poland's largest thermal power station, the Jaworzno Power Station (in Zielen Province), was also built with the help of Soviet experts using Soviet machinery and equipment. Fundamental changes have taken place in power transmission. As early as 1950, the density of the high-voltage and low-voltage power grid per square kilometer nationwide had expanded by nearly 60 percent compared to 1947. The transmission network is still expanding, and this year, for the first time, 220,000-volt high-voltage power lines will be used to transmit current from the Silesia region in southwestern Poland to central Poland.

The achievements of the power industry have promoted the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's living standards. At present, Poland's industrial electricity consumption has increased by about two times compared to pre-war levels, and industrial sectors that rely on electricity for production, such as steelmaking and fertilizer manufacturing, have expanded. In 1952, the power generated by all motors in state-owned farms and cooperative farms increased by two times compared to 1950. The number of film projection teams and radios in rural areas is also constantly increasing. By the time the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955) is completed, half of the villages in Poland will have electricity supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 6th: According to TASS, Pravda recently published a newsletter by its Warsaw correspondent, A. Luliewicz, describing the vigorous development of industry in former agricultural areas of Poland.

Luliewicz said that large-scale industrial construction in the past agricultural areas has become a prominent feature of Poland today. Before the Second World War, Poland could be divided into two parts according to economic components: one part was the industrial area, and the other part was the agricultural area. The latter mainly included the eastern Polish provinces of Białystok, Lublin, and Rzeszów. However, after the Second World War, the People's Government set a goal to develop the industry of backward areas to ensure the even distribution of the country's productive forces. Four-fifths of all construction projects stipulated in Poland's Six-Year Plan (1950-1955) were carried out in these areas.

Luliewicz then used specific examples to illustrate the huge scale of industrial development in Poland's formerly backward agricultural areas. He pointed out that Białystok Province is building several yarn factories and about thirty large and medium-sized enterprises. Rzeszów Province is building dozens of enterprises. The scale of industrial construction in Lublin Province is particularly huge, with 90 industrial enterprises under construction there, and the number of factory workers in the province has increased fivefold compared to pre-war levels. The Berut Automobile Factory is being built there according to the design of Soviet experts and on the basis of Soviet technical operating methods. Eighteen months ago, when the first batch of construction workers appeared on the construction site, it was just a barren land on the outskirts of Lublin. Now, the Berut Automobile Factory has produced the first batch of freight trucks. After the factory is fully completed and put into operation, it will be able to manufacture 25,000 vehicles annually.

Luliewicz concluded: The development of industry has changed the face of agricultural areas. With the establishment of large factories, new socialist residential areas have appeared between forests and fields. The silence of forests and fields has been broken by the roar of factory machines. Thanks to the will of the free people, backward areas are becoming economically developed areas of People's Poland.

    波兰电力工业在苏联帮助下获得迅速发展
    大规模工业建设改变了农业区的面貌
    【新华社六日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰的电力工业已获得了迅速的发展。一九五二年年底全国发电量，按人口平均计算比战前增加了三倍多。过去两年中每年的发电量都增加了百分之十三。有着苏联整套新式透平装备的波兰最大的水电站——鲁德维克·瓦林斯基水电站（在迪霍夫省），它的发电量就等于战前波兰所有水电站的总发电量的三倍。目前，波兰正在苏联的帮助下继续装备新的发电机和建筑新的发电站。斯大林诺格罗德省的霍若夫电力站最近有一套新式的透平已经开工，它的电力足够供给两个大煤矿场的需用。波兰最大的火力发电站——雅沃日诺电力站（在泽兰省），也在苏联专家的帮助下用苏联的机器和设备建立起来。电力输送方面已发生了根本的变化。早在一九五○年，全国每一平方公里的高压和低压电线分布网的密度，已比一九四七年扩展了将近百分之六十。现在输电网还在扩展中，今年将第一次用二十二万伏特的高压电线把波兰西南部西里西亚地区的电流输送到波兰中部地区。
    电力工业的成就已促进了国民经济的发展和人民生活福利的提高。现在波兰工业方面的用电量比战前大约增加了两倍，依靠电力进行生产的工业部门，如炼钢、肥料制造等部门都已扩大。一九五二年国营农场和合作社农场所有电动机的发电量比一九五○年增加了两倍。电影放映队和农村中的收音机的数目也在不断地增加着。到六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）完成时，波兰全国将有半数的乡村得到电力的供应。
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报最近刊载了该报驻华沙记者阿·卢利维兹的一篇通讯，叙述波兰前农业地区大力发展工业的情况。
    卢利维兹说，在过去的农业地区大规模进行工业建设，已成为今天波兰的一个显著的特点。在第二次世界大战前，按照经济成分，波兰可分为两个部分：一部分是工业区，另一部分是农业区。后者主要包括贝鲁斯托克、卢布林和彻索夫等波兰东部各省。但是，在第二次世界大战后，人民政府确定了一个目标，要发展落后区域的工业以保证国家的生产力得到均匀的分布。波兰六年（一九五○—一九五五年）计划所规定的全部建设工程中，有五分之四就是在这些地区进行的。
    卢利维兹接着用具体的事例来说明波兰在前落后农业区发展工业的巨大规模，他指出，贝鲁斯托克省正在建筑若干纱厂和三十个左右的大型和中型的企业。彻索夫省正在建筑几十个企业。卢布林省工业建设的规模尤其巨大，那里正在建筑的工业企业有九十个，全省工厂工人的数目已增加为战前的五倍。贝鲁特汽车工厂正依照苏联专家的设计并在苏联技术操作法的基础上在那里建立起来。在十八个月以前，当第一批建筑工人出现在建筑工地上时，这里不过是卢布林市郊的一片荒土。现在，贝鲁特汽车工厂已经出产了第一批运货汽车。这个工厂全部建成和开工生产后，每年将可制造二万五千辆汽车。
    卢利维兹最后说：工业的发展使农业区域的面貌改变了。随着大工厂的建立，在树林和田野间已出现了新的社会主义居住区。森林和田野间的寂静已被工厂机器的隆隆声打破了。由于自由人民的意志，落后的地区正在变成人民波兰的经济发达的地区。
