Xinhua News Agency, April 14th:

    The American aggressors, who are implementing the policy of “using Asians to fight Asians,” are facing many difficulties in expanding the Li Seung-man puppet army. Therefore, according to recent disclosures in American newspapers and magazines, the US-Li clique, which originally intended to expand the Li puppet army to at least twenty divisions, has had to abandon its original expansion target and “limit the number to sixteen divisions.”
    The difficulties faced by the US-Li clique in expanding the Li puppet army are primarily the depletion of manpower. According to a Tokyo dispatch from Reuters on February 26th, the Li Seung-man gang has “conscripted nearly one million men into various service departments.” This includes not only those conscripted into the puppet army but also those conscripted into the “police force” and the so-called “South Korean Service Corps,” which “performs arduous and strenuous tasks such as carrying, manual labor, and road construction for the United Nations forces.” Therefore, the dispatch said: Li Seung-man “has almost completely run out of reserves,” and “United Nations civil affairs personnel believe that the South Korean army has almost reached the end of its expansion.” However, more seriously, the “casualty rate of the Li puppet army is greater than the rate at which young people reach the age of enlistment,” which makes it even more difficult for the US-Li clique to achieve its goal of expanding the army.
    Regarding the Li Seung-man gang’s lack of manpower, “The New York Times” published a dispatch from Seoul on January 22nd entitled “South Korea Soon to Exhaust its Manpower Reserves,” which contained specific disclosures. This dispatch said: “Colonel Rong, who is in charge of conscription affairs in Seoul, said that 95 to 98 percent of the men listed on the conscription rosters in his possession have already been conscripted. He also said that, as far as he knows, the phenomenon of manpower shortage is also common in all provinces except for large cities such as Daegu and Busan.” This dispatch said that the Li Seung-man authorities are “planning to remove men managing rear service equipment in Seoul and replace them with women and wounded veterans”; it also placed great hope on expanding the age limit for conscription, but this dispatch admitted: “The names on the conscription roster will not necessarily become people holding guns on the front line,” “as experience has shown, 40 percent of those listed on the conscription roster will be unable to enlist due to physical reasons, and many others will simply disappear without a trace.”
    In addition to the lack of manpower, the Li Seung-man gang, facing economic collapse, also lacks the strength to supply a large army. The Li puppet army soldiers are receiving less and less food. Puppet Defense Minister Shin Tae-young admitted that puppet army soldiers only receive one-third of their normal calorie requirements per day. Puppet army authorities also revealed that at least 7,500 soldiers (equivalent to two regiments) are sent to hospitals each month due to tuberculosis or malnutrition. A United Press Seoul dispatch acknowledged that the Li gang's mere maintenance of 300,000 soldiers in fourteen divisions is already “causing a huge budget deficit and triggering a spiral of inflation.” Not to mention maintaining a larger army.
    Therefore, the American “Newsweek” published on March 9th wrote: “Due to the limited manpower in South Korea and its economic weakness, the Pentagon has decided to limit itself to establishing sixteen divisions (of the Li puppet army) at present. It believes that it is currently impossible to establish twenty divisions.”
    The frantic conscription and expansion of the Li puppet army by the US and Li gangs have inflicted terrible disasters on the South Korean people. As Reuters acknowledged, many South Korean families have been rendered “destitute” by conscription and forced labor. “The South Korean government does not care about the lives of soldiers’ families, leaving them to fend for themselves. Therefore, it often happens that after a man is conscripted, the women, children, and elderly he leaves behind have to abandon their fields and homes passed down for generations and flee to overcrowded refugee camps.” The South Korean people are unwilling to be cannon fodder for the US and Li gangs. They evade the conscription of the US and Li gangs, “whenever rumors spread that conscription teams are out and about,” they “hide one after another.” To this end, according to the United Press, the Li Seung-man gang will use $200,000 to build six more concentration camps in addition to the existing ones to imprison South Koreans who evade conscription. However, facts have proven that this barbaric repression cannot extinguish the resistance of the South Korean people but can only make the flames of popular resistance burn even more fiercely.

### 李承晚匪帮人力枯竭并面临经济崩溃  美国侵略者扩充李伪军的计划受到挫折

    李承晚匪帮人力枯竭并面临经济崩溃
    美国侵略者扩充李伪军的计划受到挫折
    【新华社十四日讯】实行“用亚洲人打亚洲人”政策的美国侵略者，在扩充李承晚伪军的问题上，有很多困难。因此，据美国报纸杂志最近透露：原来打算至少把李伪军扩充到二十个师的美李匪帮，已不得不放弃原定的扩充目标，“把数目限制为十六个师”。
    美李匪帮扩充李伪军的困难，首先是人力的枯竭。据路透社二月二十六日东京电透露，被李承晚匪帮“征入各种服役部门的壮丁已将达一百万人”。其中除征入伪军者外，还包括征入“警察部队”和
    “专替联合国军做艰苦吃力的搬运、苦工和修路等工作”的所谓“南韩服务团”的在内。因此，消息说：李承晚“差不多已完全没有了后备力量”，“联合国民政工作人员认为，南朝鲜军差不多已到了扩张的尽头”。但是，更严重的是，李伪军的“伤亡速率比青年人到达入伍年龄的速率大”，这就使得美李匪帮妄想达到扩充军队的目标更加困难。
    关于李承晚匪帮缺乏人力的情形，“纽约时报”在一月二十二日发表的题为“韩国的后备兵力很快就要用光”的汉城通讯中，有具体的透露。这篇通讯中说：“负责汉城征兵事务的荣上校说，列名在他手中的征兵名册上的壮丁，百分之九十五到九十八已被征入伍。他并说，据他所知，除了大邱和釜山等大城市外，人力缺乏的现象在所有的道内也很普遍。”这篇通讯中说，李承晚当局正“计划在汉城抽走管理后方设备的壮丁，而代之以妇女和受过伤的退伍军人”；它还把极大的希望寄托在扩大征兵年限上，但是，这篇通讯中承认：“征兵册上的名字不一定会变成战线上拿枪杆的人”，“正如经验所显示的一样，在那些被列入征兵名册的人中，有百分之四十将因体格上的缘故而不能入伍，而另有许多人简直就会躲得无影无踪”。
    除了人力缺乏之外，面临经济崩溃的李承晚匪帮也没有力量供应一支庞大的军队。李伪军士兵得到的粮食愈来愈少。伪国防部长官申泰英承认：伪军士兵每天只能得到正常所需要的三分之一的发热量。伪军当局并透露：每个月，至少有七千五百个士兵（相当于两个团），因肺结核或饮食不良被送入医院。合众社汉城电承认，李匪帮仅仅这样可怜地维持十四个师的三十万士兵的供应，就“已经造成了庞大的预算赤字，引起了螺旋式的通货膨胀”。更不必说要维持更多的军队。
    三月九日出版的美国“新闻周刊”因此写道：“由于南朝鲜人力的有限以及在经济上的不振，五角大楼已决定在目前以建立十六师（李伪军）为限。它认为目下并无建立二十师的可能。”
    美、李匪帮疯狂抓丁扩充李伪军，使南朝鲜人民受到可怕的灾难。如路透社所承认的，南朝鲜许多家庭被征兵和拉伕而害得“无依无靠”。“南朝鲜政府对于士兵家属的生活一概不理，让他们自生自灭。因此，常常有这种情形发生，壮丁被征入伍之后，他们留下的妇孺老幼便不得不放弃许多代传下来的田园庐舍，流亡入拥挤得水泄不通的难民营。”南朝鲜人民都不愿替美李匪帮当炮灰。他们逃避美李匪帮的征兵，“每当拉丁队四出拉伕的风声传出的时候”，他们便“纷纷躲藏起来”。为此，据合众社说，李承晚匪帮在已有的几座集中营以外，还将以二十万美元修建集中营六座，监禁逃避征兵的南朝鲜人。然而，事实证明，这种野蛮的镇压不可能扑灭南朝鲜人民的抗拒，而只能使人民反抗的怒火燃烧得更加炽烈。
