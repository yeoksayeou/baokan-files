Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th. More than 21,000 Korean orphans who came to Northeast China at the invitation of our government are living happy and joyful lives under the care of local people's governments and the people.

These Korean orphans, who lost their parents and families at the hands of the American bandits, have been placed in 34 children's academies and 14 childcare centers in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces since they arrived in Northeast China last winter. The people's governments of Northeast China organized medical teams to treat them and helped the children's academies and childcare centers establish clinics and children's health committees. The orphans have a very good diet, with fine grains for every meal, as well as fruits and desserts. Small stadiums and bathhouses have also been opened in various places. Now, their morbidity rate has been greatly reduced, and their weight has generally increased. The orphans placed in various parts of western Liaoning have gained an average of 4.33 kilograms each.

Korean orphans are warmly loved by the local people in Northeast China. Chinese elementary school students in Liaoyang, Liaoyuan and other places often perform various song and dance dramas to celebrate with Korean children. Many Chinese students give their favorite badges, pencils, diaries, and other items to Korean children they meet on the street.

    来我国的两万多名朝鲜孤儿
    过着愉快幸福生活
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】应我国政府邀请前来我国东北的两万一千多名朝鲜孤儿，在各地人民政府和人民的关怀下，过着愉快幸福的生活。
    这些被美国强盗杀害了父母、失去了家庭的朝鲜孤儿，在去年冬天来到我国东北以后，就被安置在辽东、辽西、松江和吉林等省的三十四处儿童学院和十四处爱育园中。东北各地人民政府组织了医疗队给他们治疗，并帮助各儿童学院和爱育园建立了卫生所和儿童保健委员会。孤儿们的饮食很好，每日除三餐细粮外，还有水果、点心等食物。各地还开辟了小型体育场和澡塘。现在，他们的患病率大大减少，体重普遍增加。安置在辽西各地的孤儿们，每人体重平均增加四点三三公斤。
    朝鲜孤儿在东北各地受到当地人民的热烈爱护。辽阳、辽源等地的中国小学生，经常演出各种歌舞剧与朝鲜儿童联欢。许多中国学生在街上遇到朝鲜儿童时，就把自己所喜爱的证章和铅笔、日记本等送给他们。
