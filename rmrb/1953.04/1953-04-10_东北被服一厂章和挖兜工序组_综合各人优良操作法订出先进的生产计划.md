    Northeast Garment Factory No. 1: Zhang He and Pocket-Cutting Work Group Develop Advanced Production Plan by Integrating Excellent Operational Methods
    The pocket-cutting work group of the Fourth Workshop of Northeast Garment Factory No. 1, when starting to formulate a production plan, was initially hampered by the group leader, Zhang He's, low output and conservative thinking, failing to unite all the workers in the group to unleash their production enthusiasm. As a result, no one in the group was clear about the group's production capacity, and no one actively offered solutions during discussions.

    After understanding the situation of their group, the leadership believed that each person in the group had their own set of operational methods, and no one was willing to learn from others' strengths. Therefore, everyone lacked confidence in improving production. This was the biggest obstacle to formulating a plan. At this time, the leadership invited Zhao Yuqing, an advanced worker from the Second Workshop, to demonstrate his operational methods for them to observe and discuss. This dispelled the conservative thinking of the work group leader, Zhang He. He realized that everyone's operational methods had their own characteristics, and as long as he learned from others' advanced experiences, he could increase output. Zhang He also conducted a self-criticism of his past mistakes in not uniting everyone to unleash their enthusiasm. Consequently, all sixteen people in their group began to exchange experiences, identifying the advantages of Su Xiyuan's fast "pocket stitching" and "joining," Liu Chunlin's quick hands when "attaching the pocket facing," and Sun Wenzhe's steady hands and accurate eyes. After everyone's discussion, and with the addition of learning from other groups' experiences, they integrated a complete set of advanced operational methods. Everyone's output greatly increased as a result. Li Shuhua, who used to make a maximum of one hundred and ten pieces per day, now makes one hundred and thirty pieces without feeling tired. Zhang He's output also increased from one hundred and forty pieces to one hundred and sixty pieces per day. After synthesizing this set of advanced operational methods, everyone felt confident and emboldened, resolving to formulate an advanced plan. After discussion, their group finally formulated an advanced plan to increase output by 20% while ensuring quality.

    东北被服一厂章和挖兜工序组
    综合各人优良操作法订出先进的生产计划
    东北第一被服厂第四车间挖兜工序组，开始订生产计划时，因为组长章和的产量不高，有保守思想，不能团结全组工人发挥生产积极性，所以大家对组内的生产能力都摸不到底，讨论时谁也不积极提办法。
    领导方面了解了他们小组的情况以后，认为他们组内各人都有一套自己的操作法，谁也不肯学习别人的优点，因此大家对提高生产都没有信心。这是订计划的最大障碍。这时，领导方面就请第二车间先进工人赵玉清来表演操作法，让他们看了以后进行讨论。这一来，把工序组长章和的保守思想打消了。他认识到每个人的操作法都有自己的特点，只要好好学习别人的先进经验，就能提高产量。章和还对自己过去不团结大家发挥积极性的错误进行了检讨。于是，他们组内十六个人都互相交流起经验来，找出了苏喜元“钉兜”打接快，刘春林“上兜牙”时双手拿活快，孙文哲手稳眼准等的优点，经过大家讨论，再加上学习别组的经验，就综合出了一套完整的先进操作法。各人的产量都因此大为提高。李树华过去每日最多作一百一十件，现在作一百三十件还不累。章和的产量也由每日一百四十件提高到一百六十件。大家综合出这一套先进操作法后，心里有了底，胆子也壮了，都决心要订出先进计划来。经过讨论后，他们小组终于订出了提高产量百分之二十并保证质量的先进计划。
