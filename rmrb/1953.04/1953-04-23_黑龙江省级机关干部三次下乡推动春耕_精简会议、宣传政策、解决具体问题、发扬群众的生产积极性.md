Heilongjiang Provincial机关 Cadres Go to the Countryside Three Times to Promote Spring Ploughing
Streamlining Meetings, Publicizing Policies, Solving Specific Problems, and Developing the Masses' Enthusiasm for Production

Since mid-February, more than 100 cadres from various机关 and organizations in Heilongjiang Province have twice gone to the countryside to inspect and promote spring planting. Around April 15th, Zheng Xueli, Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Luo Zicheng, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department, and Jin Langbai, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture, led 17 inspection teams for the third time to the countryside, striving to implement the CCP Central Committee's Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation and the Instructions on Spring Ploughing Production to Party Committees at All Levels. Before their departure, Feng Jixin, Secretary of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, made a mobilization report, emphasizing the following four issues:

One, cadres at all levels must clearly recognize that spring ploughing is the overriding central task in the current countryside. This is a principle that cannot be shaken and must be implemented clearly, affirmatively, and resolutely. All work should be carried out on the principle of not hindering spring ploughing production. Work such as militia training and literacy campaigns can be temporarily suspended. The patriotic health campaign should also be carried out in conjunction with spring ploughing production. The rectification of village finances should not be carried out as typical demonstrations in every district. Meetings that can be avoided should be avoided. Necessary meetings should take the form of flexible "field meetings." All work must value the time of the peasants. Anyone who troubles the peasants, wastes their time, or hinders spring ploughing is making a mistake.

Two, continue to deeply publicize policies, eliminate farmers' concerns, and enable farmers to consciously and actively produce. This requires cadres at all levels to understand agricultural production policies, and diligently study the CCP Central Committee's "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and "Instructions on Spring Ploughing Production to Party Committees at All Levels," as well as the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production." This time going to the countryside, the first task is to check how well the county and district cadres have learned, and what problems they do not understand; and they should also earnestly understand what doubts farmers have about the Party's agricultural production policies, and what they do not understand. Everything should be explained with local examples, rather than simply criticizing. When conducting policy supplementary lessons, provincial, county, and district leaders should directly meet with the masses; at the same time, attention should be paid to improving the policy level of village cadres, party members, and activists; because they are in contact with the masses every day, and their words and deeds will affect the masses.

Three, earnestly check the material preparations for spring ploughing and sowing, such as seeds, manure, and agricultural tools. If problems are found, they must be resolved immediately, and if they cannot be resolved, they should be reported to the higher levels as soon as possible. Regarding the two-way benefit issue in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, it is best to deal with it appropriately in accordance with the spirit of "adapting to local conditions, simplicity and ease of implementation, and being reasonable and sensible." In agricultural production cooperatives, the main task is to solve the problems of labor organization and labor-day calculation. Regarding the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience, it is required not to be too high, plans should not be too large, they must be practical and feasible, and adhere to the principle of key promotion. It is best to promote them gradually in stages by season, adopting the method of learning, doing, and improving, and gradually improving technology.

Four, regarding the leadership style of going to the countryside. Be good at organizing the strength of county and district cadres, and make good use of this group of forces, instead of "diving in headfirst." After going down, rely on the masses, consult with the masses on everything, summarize the advanced experience of the masses, and respect the masses' property private ownership. In short, everything is for maintaining and developing the peasants' full production enthusiasm. (Fang Qing, Yu Xibin)

    黑龙江省级机关干部三次下乡推动春耕
    精简会议、宣传政策、解决具体问题、发扬群众的生产积极性
    黑龙江省级各机关团体干部百余人，自二月中旬以来，已先后两次深入农村检查和推动春耕播种工作。四月十五日前后，省委组织部部长郑学礼、农村工作部副部长骆子程、省人民政府农业厅副厅长金浪白等又分别率领十七个检查组第三次下乡，努力贯彻中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议和关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示。行前中共黑龙江省委书记冯纪新同志作了动员报告，着重指出下面四个问题：
    一、必须使各级干部明确地认识春耕是当前农村压倒一切的中心工作，这是丝毫不能动摇的原则，必须明确地、肯定地、坚决地执行。一切工作的进行，都应当以不妨碍春耕生产为原则。如民兵训练、扫除文盲等工作，都可以暂时停止进行。爱国卫生运动也要结合春耕生产进行。村财政的整顿，不要每区都作典型示范，可开可不开的会议一律不开，必要的会议则多采取灵活的“地头会”形式。一切工作的进行，都必须珍惜农民时间；谁要是找农民的麻烦，浪费农民的时间，妨碍了春耕的进行，就是犯了错误。
    二、继续深入地宣传政策，消除农民顾虑，使农民自觉地积极生产。这就要求各级干部懂得农业生产政策，努力学习中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”和“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”，以及人民日报社论“领导农业生产的关键所在”三个文件。这次下乡，首先要检查县区干部学得怎么样，有什么不懂得的问题；并应切实了解农民对党的农业生产政策有什么疑虑，哪一点不懂，都应用本地实例加以说明，而不要单纯地批判。在进行政策补课时，省、县、区领导干部要直接和群众见面；同时注意提高村干部、党员、积极分子的政策水平；因为他们天天和群众接触，一言一行都会影响群众。
    三、切实检查春耕播种的物质准备，如籽种、粪肥、农具等。发现问题要立即解决，不能解决的赶快报告上级。关于互助合作组织中的两利问题，最好是根据“因地制宜，简单易行，入情入理”的精神，适当处理。在农业生产合作社中，主要解决劳动组织、劳动日计算问题。对于推广肇源经验，要求不要过高，计划不要过大，一定要切实可行，坚持重点推广的原则。最好是按季分段，逐步推广，采取边作、边学、边改进的方法，逐步提高技术。
    四、关于下乡的领导作风问题。要善于组织县区干部的力量，好好地运用这批力量，而不应当“一头钻下去”。下去以后，又要好好依靠群众，遇事和群众商量，总结群众先进经验，尊重群众的财产私有权。总之，一切都是为着保持和发扬农民群众的饱满的生产热情。（方青、于喜滨）
