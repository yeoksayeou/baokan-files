On the Battlefront of National Economic Construction
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Ma'anshan is Rebuilding an Iron Smelting Plant
    An state-owned iron smelting plant is being rebuilt in Ma'anshan, Anhui Province. This iron smelting plant includes six small blast furnaces. After the reconstruction, the production capacity of the blast furnaces will more than double the original design capacity. The annual output will be close to the amount of pig iron needed by Shanghai's steelmaking and mechanical foundry industries. This iron smelting plant will be able to produce pig iron in the second half of this year. In the past, Shanghai relied on long-distance supply for the pig iron it needed. After the Ma'anshan iron smelting plant is completed, Shanghai will have a very convenient source of pig iron.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Survey of the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area Completed
    The Forest Survey Team of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government has completed the survey of the Greater Khingan Range forest area, China's "forest treasure house."
    This survey of the Greater Khingan Range forest area was conducted by the Forest Survey Team of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government in coordination with the surveying personnel of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, relevant departments of the forest industry, and guides from the Oroqen ethnic group, forming a Greater Khingan Range forest area survey team of 370 people. They arrived in batches in early August 1952 in Mohe, Huma and other places in the northernmost part of China. Subsequently, they began an unprecedented survey in the history of China's forestry along the Huma River and the Amur River. In the virgin forests of the Greater Khingan Range, where few people have gone and wild animals abound, the survey team members received enthusiastic help from the local Oroqen people. More than 200 Oroqen hunters, men and women, who have lived at the foot of the Greater Khingan Range for generations, came to serve as guides; some hunters led horses specially trained to run in the forests, and their whole families came to transport supplies for the survey team. The survey team members overcame the extreme cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius and, after more than 100 days of hard life camping and sleeping in the open, finally completed the survey of the entire forest area at the end of last year, with each group surveying a total of 37,652 *li* of deep mountains, canyons, and grasslands.
    Based on the results of this survey, the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government has proposed the policy of implementing nurturing and renewal in the Greater Khingan Range forest area in the future, in order to cultivate forest resources, and has initially determined the right bank area of the Huma River as the logging area for the next five years. In order to transport timber and develop mineral deposits, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government is preparing to build a forest railway in the Greater Khingan Range.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Zhejiang Coastal Fishing Areas Have a Good Harvest of Small Yellow Croaker
    The small yellow croaker season in the coastal fishing areas of Zhejiang Province is nearing its end. Schools of small yellow croaker have moved north from Miyuyang and Putuoshan Ocean to Sheshan Ocean, and more than 1,000 fishing boats are tracking and catching them. During this year's small yellow croaker season in Zhejiang's coastal areas, fishermen in the Dinghai fishing area alone caught nearly 100,000 *dan*. It is estimated that the entire small yellow croaker season will yield more than 200,000 *dan*, the first major harvest in several years. Now, the large yellow croaker season, which has the largest fish production in Zhejiang's coastal areas in a year, is about to begin. With the strong support of the People's Government, coastal fishermen are making preparations. Fishing boats have been renovated, and many newly built fishing boats will also go to sea during this fishing season. During this large yellow croaker season, more than 10,000 fishing boats will go to sea, an increase of about 7 percent compared to last year. The fishing nets equipped for each fishing boat have also increased from one or two per pair of boats in the past to two or three. At present, tens of thousands of fishermen near Maotouyang, Damuyang, and Daiquyang are full of joy to welcome the arrival of the large yellow croaker schools.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Fujian Wheat Harvest Increases by 10 Percent Compared to Last Year
    Fujian Province has achieved another good wheat harvest this year. At present, wheat in the southern and eastern counties has been harvested one after another. It is estimated that the province's total output can reach 179 million *jin*, an increase of more than 10 percent compared to last year. State-owned grain companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and private merchants have begun purchasing; in the purchasing process, they have implemented the price policy of "grading pricing, good wheat good price" to encourage farmers to improve production technology and improve wheat quality. In some places, grain companies and cooperatives have also signed contracts with farmers to purchase wheat and supply fertilizer in the purchasing process, in order to meet farmers' needs to sell wheat and buy fertilizer and other means of production.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Northeast Rural Areas Carry Out Sheep Breed Improvement Work
    Northeast rural areas are actively carrying out sheep breed improvement work. Raising sheep, which is easy to feed, profitable, and rewarding, is a type of animal husbandry production that farmers and herdsmen in Northeast China enjoy managing. In recent years, with the support of the People's Government, the number of sheep in various places has increased rapidly. Now the number of sheep in the entire region has exceeded more than twice the highest number in history. However, most of the sheep in the Northeast region are coarse-wool sheep, with low wool production and poor wool quality. In order to improve this situation and transform coarse-wool sheep into fine-wool sheep, the Northeast region has carried out sheep breed improvement work. Now, ten breeding sheep farms have been established in the entire region, containing a large number of high-quality breeding sheep purchased from the Soviet Union and other parts of the country, and scientific artificial insemination methods have been adopted for breeding work. The semen of one breeding ram can now be used to inseminate 150 to 200 ewes, greatly increasing the number of breeding.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Seed Bactericide "Xilisheng" Successfully Trial-Produced
    After two years of research, the Institute of Physical Chemistry and the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have successfully trial-produced the seed bactericide "Xilisheng" for the prevention and control of wheat and cotton diseases, and have completed the production test in an intermediate factory.
    "Xilisheng" is a mercury preparation that can prevent and control wheat bunt disease and cotton blight, anthracnose and other diseases. The demand in agricultural production is very large, and in the past it has always relied on imports.
    In the process of researching and manufacturing the raw material ethylmercuric chloride for "Xilisheng," the Institute of Physical Chemistry and the Institute of Organic Chemistry discovered that the intermediate diethylmercury can be prepared without any catalyst, and a higher yield can be obtained than when using a catalyst. This discovery not only simplifies the production operation process and reduces costs, but also academically breaks the century-old convention that ethyl acetate or acetone must be used as a catalyst to prepare diethylmercury.
    The cost of domestically produced "Xilisheng" is much lower than that of foreign products. Foreign products cost 24 million yuan per ton, while domestically produced products cost only 15 million yuan per ton (of which 4 million yuan is packaging costs). After bacterial tests and field tests, domestically produced "Xilisheng" has proven to have stronger bactericidal power than American products.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A New Creation in the Transportation of Heavy Items by Automobile
    For the needs of a project, the Southwest Hydroelectric Power Engineering Office needed to transport a 17-ton generator rotor from the riverside of Changshou County, Sichuan Province, to a construction site about 24 kilometers away. However, the only transportation tool was a 4.5-ton truck, which could not tow it. To solve this problem, automobile driver Jia Shikui suggested using the existing 4.5-ton International brand ten-wheel truck for modification and reinforcement to undertake this transportation task. This suggestion was actively supported by repair technician Zhang Zhixiong, and also received specific help and support from the Party, administration, and trade union. The modification and reinforcement were quickly and successfully completed.
    The modified and reinforced 4.5-ton International brand ten-wheel truck does not require any additions to the load-bearing structure, power, or transmission components, except for the addition of four tires. This transportation of the generator rotor saved the state 96.33 million yuan in freight costs and ensured the timely installation and safe transportation of the machine. The office is currently continuing to research and improve it, and it is estimated that it can carry 20-ton heavy items at a time after further improvements.
    The Yongli Ning Factory Produces Vanadium Catalyst in Large Quantities
    After three years of systematic research and experimentation, the Experimental Workshop of the Chemical Research Institute of Yongli Ning Factory has mastered the entire manufacturing technology and production process of vanadium catalyst, a valuable catalyst for the sulfuric acid industry, and is now beginning to produce it in large quantities according to plan to meet the needs of relevant factories across the country. This product was successfully developed under the circumstances of the American imperialist blockade against our country, which attempted to suffocate our chemical factories. The product efficiency is 0.5 to 1 percent higher than that of the American "trump card" Monsanto Chemical Company product. This creation was awarded first prize at the Nanjing Rationalization Proposal Award Conference in 1951.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    马鞍山正在重建一座炼铁厂
    安徽省马鞍山正在重建一座国营炼铁厂。这座炼铁厂包括六个小型炼铁炉，重建后，炼铁炉的生产能力将超过原设计能力两倍以上，年产量和上海市炼钢与机械翻砂工业所需要的生铁数量接近平衡。这个炼铁厂在今年下半年就可以出产生铁。过去上海所需要的生铁都是依靠远途供应，马鞍山炼铁厂建成后，上海就可以得到一个非常近便的生铁供应地。    （据新华社讯）
    大兴安岭林区踏查完毕
    中央人民政府林业部森林调查总队，已把我国的“森林宝库”——大兴安岭林区踏查完毕。
    这次踏查大兴安岭林区，是中央人民政府林业部森林调查总队配合中央人民政府铁道部大铁勘测人员、森林工业各有关部门和鄂伦春民族的向导等，组成三百七十人的大兴安岭林区踏查队进行的。他们在一九五二年八月上旬分批到达我国最北部的漠河、呼玛等地。随后，他们又分组沿呼玛河、阿穆尔河，开始了我国林业史上空前规模的踏查工作。踏查队员们在人迹罕至、野兽成群的大兴安岭处女林工作中，受到了当地鄂伦春民族人民的热情帮助。呼玛县有二百多名世居大兴安岭山麓的鄂伦春族男女猎人前来做向导；有的猎户牵着专门在森林里奔走的马，全家来给踏查队运输物资。踏查队队员们战胜了零下三十度以上的奇寒，经过一百多天野营、露宿的艰苦生活。各组合计共徒步踏查了三万七千六百五十二里的深山峡谷和草原，终于在去年年底完成了整个林区的踏查工作。
    根据这次踏查的结果，中央人民政府林业部提出了今后要对大兴安岭林区实行抚育更新的方针，以培育森林资源，并初步确定呼玛河右岸地区为最近五年的采伐区。为了运输木材和开发矿藏，中央人民政府铁道部并准备在大兴安岭修建一条森林铁道。    （据新华社讯）
        浙江省沿海渔区小黄鱼丰收
    浙江省沿海渔区小黄鱼汛已近结束。小黄鱼群已由米鱼洋、普陀洋北游进入佘山洋，一千多艘鱼船，正跟踪捕捉。今年浙江沿海小黄鱼汛中，仅定海渔区的渔民就捕了近十万担。预计整个小黄鱼汛期内，将有二十万担以上的收获量，为数年来第一次大丰收。现在，浙江沿海一年中鱼产量最大的大黄鱼汛就要开始。沿海渔民在人民政府大力扶助下，正紧张进行准备。渔船都已修整一新，不少新造渔船也要在这次鱼汛中下海。这次大黄鱼汛期内，下海渔船将有一万艘以上，比去年约增加百分之七。各渔船配备的鱼网，也由过去每对船一顶到二顶，增加到两顶到三顶。目前，猫头洋、大目洋和岱衢洋附近数万渔民，都满怀喜悦地迎接大黄鱼群的到来。    （据新华社讯）
        福建小麦丰收较去年增产一成
    福建省今年小麦又获丰收。目前南部和东部各县小麦已经先后收割完毕。据估计，全省产量可达一亿七千九百万斤，普遍较去年增产一成以上。各地国营粮食公司、供销合作社和私商已经开始收购；在收购中，都贯彻了“分级论价，好麦好价”的价格政策，以鼓励农民改进生产技术，提高小麦品质。有些地方的粮食公司和合作社在收购中，还和农民订立了收购小麦和供应肥料的合同，以满足农民卖出小麦、买进肥料等生产资料的要求。（新华社）
    东北农村进行改良羊种工作
    东北农村正积极进行改良羊种工作。便于饲养、得利又多的养羊工作，是东北农牧民喜欢经营的一种牧业生产。几年来，在人民政府的扶植下，各地羊只数量增加十分迅速。现在全区的羊只数量已超过了历史上最高数目的一倍多。但是，东北区的绵羊多为粗毛羊，产毛量较少，毛质也差。为改善这种状况，变粗毛羊为细毛羊，东北区进行了改良羊种的工作。现在全区已建立起十个种羊场，内有从苏联和国内各地购来的大批品种优良的种羊，并采用了科学的人工授精方法进行配种工作，用一只种羊的精液已可配一百五十只到二百只母羊，大大地提高了配种数量。    （新华社）
    种子杀菌剂“西力生”试制成功
    中国科学院物理化学研究所和有机化学研究所经过两年的研究，试制防治小麦及棉花病害的种子杀菌剂“西力生”已经成功，并已完成中间工厂的生产试验。
    “西力生”是一种汞制剂，可以防治小麦黑穗病及棉的立枯、红腐、炭疽等病患，农业生产中需用量很大，过去一向依靠进口。
    物理化学研究所和有机化学研究所在研究制造
    “西力生”的原料氯化乙基汞的过程中，发现制备中间物二乙基汞不需用任何触媒，而且可以获得较用触媒时更高的产率。这一发现不但简化了生产操作过程，降低了成本，而且在学术上打破了百年来制二乙基汞必须用醋酸乙酯或丙酮等为触媒的陈规。
    自制“西力生”的成本较外国货低得多。外国货每吨需二千四百万元，自制品每吨仅需一千五百万元（其中四百万元是包装费）。自制的“西力生”经细菌试验和田间试验后，证明其杀菌力较美国货强。    （新华社）
    汽车载运重件的一个新创造
    西南水力发电工程处为了一项工程的需要，要将一个重十七吨的发电机转子由四川省长寿县江边运到约二十四公里远的工地。可是运输工具只有四吨半的卡车，拖不动。汽车驾驶员贾世魁为了解决这个问题，建议利用现有载重四吨半的万国牌十轮卡车改装加固，来承担这个运输任务。这个建议得到修车技工张志雄的积极赞助，也得到党、行政、工会的具体帮助和支持，改装加固很快的就胜利完成了。
    改装加固的四吨半的万国牌十轮卡车，除加四个轮胎外无须添改承重结构、动力及传动部分。这次装运发电机转子为国家节约了九千六百三十三万元的运费，并保证了机器的及时安装和安全运输。现该处正继续研究改进，估计再改进后可一次载运二十吨的重件。
    永利寗厂大量生产钒触媒剂
    永利寗厂化工研究所实验工场经过三年来系统的研究和试验，已掌握了硫酸工业的贵重触媒——钒触媒剂的全部制造技术及生产过程，现正开始按计划大量进行生产，供应全国各地有关工厂的需要。这种产品是在美帝国主义对我国进行封锁，妄想窒息我国的化学工厂的情况下研究成功的，产品效率较美国“王牌”孟山都化学公司产品还要高出百分之○·五到百分之一。此项创造在一九五一年南京合理化建议评奖大会上，被评为一等奖。
