    The Destruction of an Enemy Plane
    Yin Canlan

    February, a clear night. The cold wind howled, and the earth was still covered in snow.
    The anti-aircraft gunners of a certain volunteer army company had been busy digging fortifications for days, without sleep for two days and nights. Tonight, they would carry out night combat missions.
    Anti-aircraft fire had already formed a tight fire net around the "protected target," blocking the enemy planes' route into the "protected target."
    The gunners, wrapped in coats, sat on their guns, chatting idly: "I think Eisenhower might be scared of us, right? Why aren't the planes coming out!" "Damn it, we're all prepared tonight, and they're not coming!" Before the words were finished, the battalion command post relayed an order over the phone: "Tonight, the entire battalion will conduct barrier fire!"
    While the anti-aircraft gunners were on the position, studying how to shoot down enemy planes, the third surveillance post suddenly transmitted information over the phone: "Audible boom detected 100 kilometers away. Flying towards our 'protected target.'" Sure enough, after a while, a faint engine sound came from the east.
    Commander Wang Senlin immediately issued an order: "Get into position, Number Four!" The anti-aircraft gunners immediately prepared for battle with renewed vigor. The sound of the plane's engine became heavier and heavier. Based on the sound, the gunners immediately determined that it was the enemy's "B-26" light bomber. Gradually, in the bright moonlight, they could see an enemy plane flying from due east of the "protected target." The gunners said: "Look at this clumsy ox, flying so low. Let it approach our fire net!"
    The gunners tensely carried out their operations. Second gunner Zhao Yongsheng skillfully operated the elevation and depression mechanism, maintaining close contact with the first gunner, aiming the gun at the target – the "B-26" enemy plane – and closely tracking it. "What's going on? Why hasn't the company commander given the order to fire yet!" The gunners watched the approaching enemy plane, their eyes turning red with anxiety.
    When the enemy plane was about 800 meters from the position, the commander issued the order: "Fire!" "Ka-ka-ka..." The muzzle erupted in a deafening roar, and streams of fire intertwined in the sky. At that moment, the fire from neighboring positions also rose into the sky. Immediately, the night sky was woven into clusters of fire nets.
    "Whoosh!" A raging fire blazed in the midnight sky, followed by a deafening explosion. This was a "B-26" that had been hit and shattered into pieces.
    After ten minutes of intense combat, the position was silent. The gunners, still with a high degree of vigilance, stood at their battle stations, intently monitoring the sky, preventing a sudden enemy attack.

    一架敌机的毁灭
    尹灿烂
    二月，一个晴朗的夜晚。寒风刹刹地扑来，大地仍然是一片积雪。
    志愿军某连的高射炮手们，这几天忙着挖工事，两天两夜没有合眼了。今晚还要执行夜间战斗任务。
    高射炮火已经在“保卫目标”的周围组成了一个严密的火网，封锁着敌机钻进“保卫目标”的航路。
    炮手们披着大衣，坐在炮上闲扯着：“我看艾森豪威尔可能是给咱们揍怕了吧？飞机为啥不出动啦！”“真操蛋，今儿个咱们准备得好好的，它又不来啦！”话犹未了，营指挥所从电话上传来了命令：“今晚全营打拦阻射击！”
    当高射炮手们正在阵地上研究如何打落敌机的时候，突然第三监视哨从电话上传来了情况：一百公里以外，发现“爆音”。向我“保卫目标”飞来，果然，不久从东方传来了隐隐的马达声。
    指挥员王森林马上一声令下：“就定位，四号！”高射炮手们立刻生龙活虎似地作了战斗准备。飞机的马达声越来越沉重了，根据音响，炮手立刻断定这是敌人的“B—二六”轻型轰炸机。渐渐地，在明朗的月光下，可以看到一架敌机从“保卫目标”正东方飞来了。炮手们说：“瞧，这架笨牛，飞得这样低，让它接近我们的火网吧！”
    炮手们紧张地进行着自己的操作。二炮手赵永生机警地操纵着高低起落机和一炮手紧密地取得联系，把炮口对准目标——“B—二六”敌机，紧紧地跟随着它。“怎么搞的，连长还不下射击命令！”炮手们看着这架越飞越近的敌机，眼睛都急红了。
    当敌机离阵地约八百公尺时，指挥员发出命令：“放！”“吭吭吭……”炮口爆发了一阵震耳的巨响，一条条的火光在天空交织着。就在这时，友邻阵地的炮火也紧跟着升上天空。立时，夜空织成了团团的火网。
    “哗哗！”半夜空中燃起了熊熊大火，紧跟着就是一阵炸耳的巨响。这是一架“B—二六”中弹后四分五裂了。
    经过十分钟的紧张战斗，阵地上呈现出一片沉寂，炮手们仍以高度的警惕性站在自己的战斗岗位上，凝神监视着天空，防止敌人的突然袭击。
