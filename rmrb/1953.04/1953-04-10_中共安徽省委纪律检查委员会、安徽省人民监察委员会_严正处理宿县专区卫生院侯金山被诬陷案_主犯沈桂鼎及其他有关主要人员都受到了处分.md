    Concerning the incident of Shen Guiding (CCP member), former director of the Suxian Special District Health Institute in Anhui Province, suppressing criticism and framing Hou Jinshan (CCP member) (see this newspaper, February 28), the CCP Anhui Provincial Disciplinary Committee and the Anhui Provincial People's Supervision Committee repeatedly conducted in-depth investigations and research, clarified all the facts of the case, and made decisions on the handling of relevant personnel. Comrade Li Renzhi, the former secretary of the CCP Suxian District Committee, and Comrade Wu Yunpei, the deputy secretary, made serious self-criticisms in the Anhui Daily on March 31 of this year, resolving to temper themselves in the actual struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline called for by the Party, and thoroughly correct their mistakes.

    **The Course of Hou Jinshan's Framing**

    The Suxian Special District Health Institute suffered from a lack of democratic style in its leadership, disunity among cadres, continuous medical accidents, and incidents such as the theft and sale of drugs. In February 1951, Comrade Hou Jinshan reported on the institute's director, Shen Guiding, to Li Renzhi, the former secretary of the CCP Suxian District Committee, and the former Health Department of the Northern Anhui Administrative Office. After learning of this, Shen Guiding used shameless means to invite Comrade Hou Jinshan to dinner, attempting to soften him up. On April 8, 1951, the Suxian Commissioner's Office Supervisory Office, the Civil Affairs Section, and the CCP Suxian District Committee Disciplinary Inspection Committee dispatched a inspection team to the institute. Before the inspection team arrived, Shen Guiding, taking advantage of Hou Jinshan's leave to go home, spread rumors in the institute that Hou was engaging in "political activities" and arranged for people to collect so-called "political activity" materials about him. After the inspection team arrived, Shen Guiding told Xu Baoting and Wang Pei, two comrades of the inspection team, about the situation fabricated by nurse Sun Xuepin that "Hou Jinshan wanted to beat to death the health institute's associate director Chen Tingyuan and secretary Han Junxian"; at the same time, he told Chen Tingyuan about the above situation. Former District Committee Secretary Li Renzhi instructed former Public Security Director Meng Di to be responsible for the investigation. On the afternoon of the next day, Comrade Meng Di, accompanied by Tang Yide, the former chief of the Economic Security Section, went to the health institute to understand the situation from Shen Guiding and Chen Tingyuan. In addition to reporting the situation as before, Shen Guiding fabricated and said: "A rifle was lost in the institute (in fact, no gun was lost). Hou Jinshan wanted to beat me to death, but because I was vigilant, he did not dare to do it." He also said: "Hou Jinshan has not returned after the deadline and may have fled to Henan." After Meng Di reported this situation to Comrade Li Renzhi, it was decided to arrest Hou Jinshan (April 16, 1951) and order Tang Yide and Gan Huachang, the former deputy chief of the interrogation section, to be responsible for clarifying the case. After receiving this task, Tang Yide and Gan Huachang interrogated Hou Jinshan for four and a half nights and one whole night, verbally abusing and threatening him, and then putting handcuffs and shackles on him. Later, Tang Yide transferred the case to Gan Huachang for handling because he was busy with other matters. After April 27, Shen Guiding fabricated facts and reported to the Public Security Bureau several times: "Hou Jinshan's political background is unclear. He organizes backward forces, attacks progressive elements, and conspires to murder my wife, Yin Jing, and me." He also incited Associate Director Chen Tingyuan to collect "materials" about Hou Jinshan. Chen Tingyuan found a lead seal with a twelve-pointed star engraved on it and a photo of a person wearing a Napoleon hat and a Mauser pistol in Hou Jinshan's broken bag, and subjectively believed that this might be evidence that Hou Jinshan was in contact with secret agents. After being reviewed by the Public Security Bureau, it was learned that this was a photo of Comrade Du Qilin, a Communist Party member (he is now working in Xiaoxian County, Jiangsu Province), and Hou Jinshan had no political problems. However, Gan Huachang still believed that Hou Jinshan had committed murder and proposed sentencing him to imprisonment. Gan Huachang sought Tang Yide's opinion, and Tang echoed, answering "He can be sentenced for a few years." Without reporting to the Director of the Public Security Bureau or consulting the office meeting, Gan Huachang absurdly requested the Commissioner's Office Adjudication Committee to sentence Hou to more than ten years in prison (not approved). At this time, the Commissioner's Office Supervisory Office, based on the results of the Public Security Bureau's interrogation and the handling opinions passed by the Commissioner's Office meeting, reported to the former Northern Anhui Administrative Office People's Supervision Committee for approval to give Comrade Hou Jinshan the punishment of dismissal and legal action. On October 7, 1951, the Suxian Procuratorate Branch received a notice from the Commissioner's Office Supervisory Office and decided to conduct an interrogation. When Shen Guiding appeared in court on November 1 to confront Hou Jinshan with false evidence, Assistant Inspector Liu Jiaze restricted Hou from speaking and did not record the reasons he appealed. On November 10, the Suxian Procuratorate Branch determined that Hou Jinshan had committed an act of conspiring to murder cadres and filed a public prosecution with the District Court, without considering or reporting Hou Jinshan's written appeal to higher authorities. When the District Court accepted the case, Sun Xuepin had already gone to work on the Sihong water control construction site. He wrote a letter to Shen Guiding saying: "Hou Jinshan was wronged." But Shen Guiding did not report to higher authorities or the interrogation agency. When the court suspected the circumstances of this case and asked the health institute to consider Hou Jinshan's dissenting opinions, Shen Guiding and Chen Tingyuan still said that Hou Jinshan had "serious acts of betraying the Party" and requested the Party General Branch Committee to expel him from the Party. On February 27, 1952, the court invited relevant departments to sit in on the trial and determined that Hou Jinshan was innocent. On the afternoon of February 29, a general meeting was held in the health institute to announce Hou Jinshan's innocence and release. At that time, Comrade Wu Xianxian, the Minister of Propaganda of the District Committee, expressed his condolences to Comrade Hou Jinshan and immediately reinstated him, reissued his salary, and sent him to the hospital for recuperation; at the same time, the responsible comrades of the relevant authorities made self-criticisms at the meeting. But in fact, the case was not thoroughly reviewed, and it was subjectively believed that Sun Xuepin should be primarily responsible for this case and should be sentenced to one year in prison, while Shen Guiding was only considered to have feelings of revenge and was not given criminal punishment, but only given an administrative punishment of dismissal (already executed) and a warning within the Party (not executed). In February of this year, the CCP Anhui Provincial Disciplinary Committee and the Anhui Provincial People's Supervision Committee twice sent personnel to cooperate with the comrades of the District Committee to conduct a thorough inspection and clarified the actual situation of the case.

    **Decisions on the Handling of Relevant Personnel**

    Based on the above facts, the CCP Anhui Provincial Disciplinary Committee made the following decisions on the handling of relevant personnel:

    (1) Former Director Shen Guiding (Party Branch Committee member) seriously violated law and discipline, suppressed democracy, framed the whistleblower, and was of extremely bad character. He should bear direct and full responsibility for this case. Therefore, it is decided to expel him from the Party.

    (2) Associate Director Chen Tingyuan (Party Branch Secretary), incited by Shen Guiding, actively collected "materials," especially when the court pointed out that the possibility of the case being false was high, and also held a branch meeting to pass the expulsion of Comrade Hou Jinshan from the Party. The error was serious. Therefore, it is decided to give him the punishment of probation within the Party for two years.

    (3) Former Public Security Director Meng Di, personally responsible for investigating the case, listened to one-sided reflections and irresponsibly handed it over to subordinates for interrogation, displaying a serious bureaucratic style. However, he was able to recognize his mistakes afterward and apologized to Hou in person, and was the first to make a self-criticism among all relevant personnel. Therefore, it is decided to give him a warning within the Party.

    (4) Tang Yide (Party General Branch Secretary), the former chief of the Economic Security Section of the Public Security Bureau, did not investigate or study the case, but adopted continuous interrogation, verbally abusing Hou as a "traitor to the Party" in order to force a confession, and echoed "Hou Jinshan can be sentenced to imprisonment," and did not pay attention to it afterward. This bureaucracy is serious, and the interrogation style is bad. Therefore, it is decided to give him the punishment of dismissal from his post.

    (5) Gan Huachang (CCP member), the former deputy chief of the interrogation section of the Public Security Bureau, not only did not investigate or study the case, but also adopted "continuous interrogation" in order to force a confession, showing an extremely bad interrogation style and serious bureaucracy. More seriously, he subjectively determined that Hou's "attempted murder" was a fact and absurdly proposed sentencing Hou to more than ten years in prison. Therefore, it is decided to give him the punishment of probation within the Party for one year.

    (6) The District Committee Disciplinary Inspection Committee showed weakness in the struggle against the anti-Party element Shen Guiding, did not inquire beforehand, did not report afterward, and failed to implement the warning punishment for Shen. Therefore, Comrade Meng Yiqi, the former secretary of the committee, and Comrade Zhang Hong, the director of the inspection office, should both make profound self-criticisms.

    (7) Comrade Li Renzhi, the former secretary of the District Committee, dispatched people to investigate after receiving Hou's letter of complaint, but never doubted Shen's report, did not make a careful analysis of the Public Security Bureau's report, erroneously judged that Hou might be used by bad people, and did not inspect after deciding to arrest Hou. Comrade Wu Yunpei, the subsequent secretary of the District Committee, had a laissez-faire attitude towards the personnel involved in the case and failed to make correct and serious handling. Both should make profound self-criticisms.

    The Anhui Provincial People's Supervision Committee also made decisions on the handling of personnel related to this case. The following is a summary of the contents of this decision: Shen Guiding systematically strangled democracy and persecuted the whistleblower. In addition to giving him the punishment of dismissal, he should be handed over to the judicial organs for punishment according to law. Nurse Sun Xuepin had a bad style and falsely accused Hou Jinshan of attempting to "murder" cadres, which Shen Guiding used. He should bear major responsibility for this case. However, since he confessed his mistakes first and was sentenced to imprisonment by the court, he will not be re-prosecuted. Associate Director Chen Tingyuan, as a political worker in the institute, blindly listened to Shen Guiding's instigation, persisted in his mistakes, and was usually arrogant and complacent, stifling the democratic atmosphere. Therefore, he is given the punishment of dismissal. Meng Di, the former director of the Suxian Commissioner's Office Public Security Bureau, listened to one-sided remarks and had a serious bureaucratic style. However, he made a relatively profound written self-criticism on June 28, 1952, and apologized to Hou Jinshan in person. Therefore, he is given a lenient punishment of recording a major demerit. Tang Yide, the former chief of the Economic Security Section of the Public Security Bureau, had a bad interrogation style and was given the punishment of demotion. Gan Huachang, the former deputy chief of the interrogation section of the Public Security Bureau, had an even worse interrogation style and had lost the qualities that public security personnel should have. Therefore, he is given the punishment of dismissal. The former Commissioner's Office Supervisory Office failed to further investigate the problems that occurred during the inspection and was seriously irresponsible. Therefore, Zheng Liangrui, the former director, is given the punishment of recording a demerit, and Secretary Wang Pei should make a profound self-criticism. Although the Procuratorate Branch investigated and interrogated the case, it did not come to a correct conclusion and irresponsibly filed a public prosecution with the court. Its bureaucratic style was serious. Therefore, Zhao Junde, the deputy procurator-general, is given the punishment of recording a demerit, and Assistant Inspector Liu Jiaze is given a warning.

    严正处理宿县专区卫生院侯金山被诬陷案
    主犯沈桂鼎及其他有关主要人员都受到了处分
    关于安徽省宿县专区卫生院前院长沈桂鼎（中共党员）压制批评，诬陷侯金山（中共党员）的事件
    （见二月二十八日本报），中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会与安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会一再深入调查研究，弄清全部案情，并分别作出了对有关人员的处理决定。前中共宿县地委书记李任之同志和副书记吴云培同志分别在本年三月三十一日安徽日报上作了认真的检讨，决心在这次党所号召的反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的实际斗争中锻炼自己，彻底改正自己的错误。
    侯金山被诬陷的经过
    宿县专区卫生院因领导方面缺乏民主作风，干部不团结，医疗上不断发生事故，且有盗卖药物等情。侯金山同志于一九五一年二月间向中共宿县地委前任书记李任之同志和前皖北行署卫生处检举该院院长沈桂鼎。沈桂鼎知道此事以后，便运用无耻手段，请侯金山同志吃饭，企图软化他。一九五一年四月八日，宿县专署督导室、民政科和中共宿县地委纪律检查委员会派人组成检查组到该院检查。沈桂鼎在检查组未到该院之前，乘侯金山请假回家之际，在该院内散布侯有“政治活动”的谣言，并布置专人搜集关于他的所谓“政治活动”材料。检查组到该院后，沈桂鼎把护士孙学品所捏造的“侯金山要打死卫生院的协理员陈庭元、秘书韩俊先”的情况告诉检查组的徐保庭、王沛两同志；同时又把上述情况告诉了陈庭元。前地委书记李任之同志责成前公安处长孟迪同志负责侦察。孟迪同志在第二天下午偕同前经济保卫科科长汤宜德到卫生院，向沈桂鼎和陈庭元进行了解。沈桂鼎除照样报告了这个情况以外，又捏造说：“院内丢了一支长枪（其实没有丢枪）。侯金山要打死我，因我早有警惕，他未敢下手。”并说：“侯金山逾期不归，可能向河南潜逃了。”孟迪把这一情况报告了李任之同志以后，便决定将侯金山逮捕（一九五一年四月十六日），并叫汤宜德和前审讯科副科长甘华昌负责搞清案情。汤宜德和甘华昌接到这个任务后，用四个半夜和一个通宵的时间审讯侯金山，对侯金山加以辱骂威胁，随后给他带上手铐脚镣。后来，汤宜德因事忙又把这个案件转交甘华昌负责处理。四月二十七日以后，沈桂鼎又捏造事实，数次向公安处报告：“侯金山政治面目不清。他组织落后力量，打击进步分子，阴谋杀害我妻尹静和我。”并煽惑协理员陈庭元搜集有关侯金山的“材料”。陈庭元在侯金山的破皮包里查出一颗刻有十二角星的铅质私章和一张戴拿破仑帽子、腰插驳壳枪的照片，就主观地认为这可能是侯金山通特务的证据。经交公安处审查后，始知这是共产党员杜其林同志的照片（他现在江苏省萧县工作），侯金山并无政治问题。但甘华昌仍认为侯金山有谋杀行为，并提出了给他判徒刑的意见。甘华昌征求汤宜德的意见，汤竟随声附和，答以“可以判几年”。甘华昌既未向公安处长汇报，也未经过处务会议研究，就荒唐地提请专署裁判委员会判处侯十年以上徒刑（未通过）。此时，专署督导室根据公安处的审讯结果和专署署务会议通过的处理意见，报请前皖北行署人民监察委员会批准给予侯金山同志以撤职法办处分。一九五一年十月七日，宿县检察分署接到专署督导室的通报后，决定进行审讯。十一月一日沈桂鼎到庭用伪证和侯金山对质时，助理检查员刘家泽竟限制侯发言，对其所申诉的理由不予笔录。十一月十日宿县检察分署认定，侯金山有阴谋杀害干部的行为，并向专区法院提起公诉，而对侯金山的书面申诉既不考虑，也不报告上级。专区法院受理此案时，孙学品已到泗洪治淮工地工作，他曾写信给沈桂鼎说：“侯金山受了冤枉。”但沈桂鼎并未向上级或审讯机关报告。当法院怀疑这一案件的情节，要卫生院考虑侯金山的反面意见时，沈桂鼎和陈庭元仍说侯金山有“严重的叛党行为”，要求党总支委员会开除其党籍。一九五二年二月二十七日，法院邀请有关部门陪审，确定侯金山无罪，并于二月二十九日下午在卫生院召开了大会，宣布侯金山无罪开释。当时，地委宣传部长吴献贤同志向侯金山同志进行了慰问，并立即让他复职，又补发了薪金，并送他到医院休养；同时，有关机关的负责同志在会上都作了检讨。但实际上案情并没有审查确实，主观地认为孙学品对这一案件要负主要责任，应判处徒刑一年，而对沈桂鼎则认为他有趁机报复情绪，不予刑事处分，仅在行政上给予撤职处分（已执行），党内给予警告处分（未执行）。今年二月间，中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会和安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会两次派员协同地委的同志，进行了彻底的检查，搞清了案件的实际情况。
    对有关人员的处理决定
    根据上述事实，中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会对有关人员作了如下的处理决定：
    （一）前院长沈桂鼎（党支部委员）严重地违法乱纪，压制民主，陷害检举人，品质极为恶劣，对本案应负直接的完全责任。故决定开除其党籍。
    （二）协理员陈庭元（党支部书记），受沈桂鼎的煽惑，积极搜集“材料”，特别是法院指出此案假的可能性大时，还召开支部会议，通过开除侯金山同志的党籍，错误实属严重，故决定给予留党察看两年的处分。
    （三）前公安处长孟迪，亲自负责侦察该案，竟听信片面反映，且又不负责任地交下级审讯了事，有严重的官僚主义作风。惟其事后尚能认识错误，当面向侯道歉，在全体有关人员中第一个作出检讨，故决定给予党内警告处分。
    （四）公安处前经济保卫科科长汤宜德（党总支书记），对该案不调查研究，竟采取连续审讯，辱骂侯是“叛党分子”，以期逼出口供，并随声附和“可以判侯金山徒刑”，后又不加过问。这种官僚主义是严重的，审讯作风是恶劣的。故决定给予撤销工作的处分。
    （五）公安处前审讯科副科长甘华昌（中共党员），不仅对该案不进行调查研究，竟采用“连续审讯”，以期逼出口供，表现了极端恶劣的审讯作风和严重的官僚主义。更严重的是：主观认定侯“阴谋杀害未遂”是事实，并荒唐提议判处侯十年以上徒刑。故决定给予留党察看一年的处分。
    （六）地委纪律检查委员会对反党分子沈桂鼎的斗争表现软弱，事前不过问，事后未上报，对沈的警告处分，也未能执行。故该委员会前书记孟亦奇、检查室主任张鸿两同志均应作深刻检讨。
    （七）前任地委书记李任之同志，接到侯的检举信后，虽派人检查，但对沈的报告从未加以怀疑，对公安处的汇报亦未作精密分析，错误地判断侯可能被坏人利用，决定将侯逮捕以后又未检查。后任地委书记吴云培同志，对该案有关人员有姑息情绪，未能做出正确和严肃的处理。二人均应作深刻检讨。
    安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会也对与本案有关人员作出了处理决定。下面是这一决定的内容的摘要：沈桂鼎有计划地绞杀民主，迫害检举人，除给予撤职处分外，应送交司法机关依法惩办。护士孙学品作风恶劣，诬称侯金山企图“谋杀”干部，致被沈桂鼎利用，对本案应负重大责任。但因他先坦白认错，并经法院判处有期徒刑，故不再重新议处。协理员陈庭元系该院政治工作人员，盲目听从沈桂鼎的唆使，坚持错误，平时亦骄傲自满，窒息民主空气，故给予撤职处分。前宿县专署公安处长孟迪偏听偏信，有严重官僚主义作风。但他在一九五二年六月二十八日即作出比较深刻的书面检讨，并曾向侯金山当面道歉，故从宽给予记大过处分。公安处前经济保卫科长汤宜德审讯作风恶劣，给予降职处分。公安处前审讯科副科长甘华昌审讯作风更为恶劣，已丧失了公安人员应有品质，故给予撤职处分。原专署督导室对检查中发生的问题，未能进一步追查，严重不负责任，故给前主任郑良瑞以记过处分，秘书王沛应作深刻检讨。检察分署对该案虽经调查审讯，但未得出正确结论，不负责任地向法院提起公诉，官僚主义作风严重，故给副检察长赵俊德以记过处分，给助理检察员刘家泽以警告处分。
