    Thanks to the efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war has been signed; the sick and wounded prisoners of war held by both sides who are on the repatriation list have successively departed from the prisoner of war camps and will begin to be exchanged at Panmunjom tomorrow (the 20th). They are about to return to their motherland to reunite with their families and live peaceful lives. In the letters to the other side to promote the negotiation on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, the Korean and Chinese sides pointed out long ago that the reasonable solution to the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war should lead to a smooth solution to the entire prisoner of war issue, thereby promoting the armistice in Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, new proposals were put forward for a reasonable solution to the entire prisoner of war issue. These propositions have been unanimously supported by peace-loving people all over the world. Even many bourgeois representatives and opinions in countries such as the United States, Britain, and France cannot but agree to use the suggestions of the Chinese and Korean sides as the basis for resuming negotiations. When the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war was signed at Panmunjom on April 11, General Li Xiangchao, the chief member of our liaison group, also suggested that the plenary meeting of the two delegations should reconvene one or two days after the signing to discuss and resolve the entire prisoner of war issue in order to realize the Korean armistice. However, the U.S. side delayed its response to our proposal until the 17th, expressing its willingness to hold a liaison group meeting after the 18th to discuss the resumption of armistice negotiations.
    According to recent reports from bourgeois news agencies and newspapers, various noises obstructing the armistice negotiations have begun to rise again in the United States. American newspapers have repeatedly discussed that the U.S. government is preparing to involve issues that are fundamentally unrelated to the Korean issue, such as Indochina and Malaya, deliberately creating difficulties for the Korean armistice negotiations. Agence France-Presse Washington reported: A government spokesman deliberately "leaked" that the Eisenhower administration's policy was to establish a "buffer state" across the peninsula from Pyongyang to Wonsan, giving 85 percent of Korean territory to the South Korean puppet government. U.S. Republican Senator Flanders further advocated establishing a "neutral zone" along the Yalu River to resolve the Korean War. Many U.S. news agencies unanimously believe that the prospects for the armistice negotiations are not optimistic. United Press reporter McCarry said: "Even if the Communists are sincere and cooperative in the armistice negotiations, it may still be a long process to resolve the armistice issue." International News Service quoted a U.S. military officer as saying: "It seems like the honeymoon period is over." These suspiciously shaped noises cannot but arouse our deep attention.
    The Korean and Chinese people love peace because none of us needs to make huge profits from war, nor do we need to rely on war to save the economic crisis; we need peace to carry out national construction, and we need peaceful construction to improve the living standards of the people. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese people are sincere about the armistice negotiations, and even the enemy cannot deny this. But our love of peace is not because we are weak. The war of nearly three years has proved that the strength of the Korean and Chinese people has become stronger and stronger through fighting. The war situation in the past year has been particularly obvious. In the winter campaign of 1951, the enemy frantically invaded our army's front almost every day, while in the winter of 1952, the number of enemy invasions was reduced by half, and the number of our army's proactive attacks increased by nearly three times. No matter how much the enemy paid, they could not move forward on our army's front, but our army had the strength to occupy the enemy's heavily fortified positions. The recent battle of Shangpu-dong Mountain ("Old Baldy Mountain") is a clear proof. The enemy has been forced to admit that their advantage no longer exists. Therefore, we insist on peace, and we will make our best efforts to strive for the settlement of the entire prisoner of war issue and the realization of the Korean armistice, but we will never be afraid of any threats of expanding the war. If the enemy insists on launching any new military adventures to obstruct the realization of the Korean armistice, our Korean and Chinese People's Army has sufficient strength and confidence to smash it.
    Tomorrow, some of our sick and wounded prisoners of war will return. They have suffered inhuman torture and persecution in the enemy's prisoner of war camps. They have carried out unyielding struggles to defend the rights granted to them by the Geneva Conventions to return to their motherland. Now they have finally realized their desire to return to the embrace of the motherland! On behalf of the China Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to them. We vow to make more determined efforts to ensure that all compatriots who have been obstructed by the enemy and have not been able to return to their motherland will fulfill their wishes to return to their motherland and reunite with their families. Our demands are in line with public justice. The proposition put forward by our side to guide the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue by reasonably resolving the issue of repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war has been supported by people all over the world. Now is the time to test whether the U.S. government has genuine sincerity for peace.

### 为合理解决整个战俘问题而努力

    为合理解决整个战俘问题而努力
    由于朝中方面的努力，遣返病伤被俘人员协定已经签字；被列入遣返名单内的双方所收容的对方病伤被俘人员已经陆续由战俘营出发，即将于明日（二十日）开始在板门店交换，他们就要回到祖国去和家人团聚，过和平的生活了。朝中方面为促成遣返病伤战俘谈判而给对方的函件中早经指出：遣返病伤战俘问题的合理解决，应当使之引导到整个战俘问题的顺利解决，从而促进朝鲜停战，和平解决朝鲜问题，同时提出了合理解决整个战俘问题的新建议。这些主张，得到了全世界爱好和平人民的一致拥护，即美英法等国许多资产阶级代表人物和舆论，也不能不表示同意以中朝方面的建议作为恢复谈判的基础。四月十一日双方关于遣返病伤被俘人员协定在板门店签字的时候，我方联络组首席组员李相朝将军又建议双方代表团大会应于签字后一两日复会，讨论并解决全部战俘问题以实现朝鲜停战。但美方一直拖延到十七日才答复我方的建议，表示愿意于十八日以后举行联络组会议来讨论恢复停战谈判问题。
    据最近资产阶级的通讯社和报纸透露，美国国内阻挠停战谈判的各种喧嚷又开始抬头了。美国报纸一再谈论，美国政府准备把与朝鲜问题根本无关的如印度支那和马来亚的问题等牵扯在一起，故意制造朝鲜停战谈判的困难。法新社华盛顿电报道：一位政府的发言人有意地“泄漏”艾森豪威尔政府的方针是要在从平壤到元山穿过半岛中腰建立一个“缓冲国”，使朝鲜百分之八十五的国土归给南朝鲜傀儡政府统治。美国共和党参议员弗兰德斯更进一步主张，要沿鸭绿江成立一个“中立区”来解决朝鲜战争。美国许多通讯社都一致认为停战谈判的前途未可乐观。合众社记者麦克里说：“纵然共方在停战谈判中具有诚意而且实行合作，要想解决停战问题恐怕也还要经过长期的过程。”国际新闻社引一个美方军官的话说：“看起来好像蜜月佳期已经过去了。”这些形迹可疑的喧嚷，不能不引起我们深切的注意。
    朝中人民是热爱和平的，因为我们没有人需要靠战争来获得高额利润，也不需要靠战争来拯救经济危机；我们需要和平来进行国家的建设，需要和平的建设来提高人民的生活水平。因此，朝中人民对于停战谈判是有诚意的，这一点连敌人也是无法抹杀的。但我们热爱和平并不是因为我们软弱，将近三年来的战争已经证明：朝中人民的力量是越战越强了。最近一年来的战争形势表现得尤为明显。一九五一年冬季作战中敌人几乎没有一天不向我军阵线猖狂窜犯，而一九五二年冬季敌人窜犯的次数减少了一半，而我军主动出击的次数却增加了将近三倍。敌人不论付多大代价都没法向我军阵线前进一步，而我军却有力量占领敌人坚固设防的阵地，最近上浦防东山（“老秃山”）的战斗即是一个明证。敌人已经不能不被迫承认：他们的优势已经不存在了。因此，我们坚持和平，我们将尽最大的努力争取整个战俘问题的解决和实现朝鲜停战，但我们决不惧怕任何扩大战争叫嚣的恫吓。如果敌人硬要发动任何新的军事冒险来阻挠朝鲜停战的实现，我们朝中人民军队有足够的力量和信心来粉碎它。
    明天，我方的一部分病伤被俘人员就要回来了。他们在敌方的战俘营中受尽了非人道的折磨和迫害，他们为维护日内瓦公约所给予他们的权利坚持回到祖国来曾进行了不屈不挠的斗争，他们现在终于实现了他们的愿望回到祖国的怀抱来了！我们谨代表抗美援朝总会向他们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。我们誓以更坚决的努力使一切被敌方阻挠而未能回到祖国来的被俘同胞都符合他们的愿望回到祖国来和家人团聚。我们的要求是合乎公理正义的。我方提出的由遣返病伤战俘问题合理解决而引导到整个战俘问题的顺利解决的主张是得到全世界人民拥护的，现在是考验美国政府有无真正和平诚意的时候了。
