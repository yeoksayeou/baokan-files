Conscientiously Carry Out the National Population Census and Registration Work
Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs Propaganda Group

    The State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Conducting a National Population Census and Registration in Preparation for the General Election" and also formulated the "National Population Census and Registration Measures." It was decided that in 1953, the national population census and registration would be carried out concurrently with the grassroots election work in various regions. This is a very important measure. Its most direct purpose and significance at present is to prepare for the general election. In the upcoming general elections in various parts of the country, the voter registration work should be done well first. The Central Election Committee's instructions on grassroots election work state: "No citizen should be wrongly deprived of the solemn right to vote, nor should a reactionary element or a landlord class element who has not changed his class status illegally usurp the solemn right to vote." To achieve this, it is of course necessary to mobilize the masses to recognize the importance of elections and the solemnity of the right to vote, and to have the masses discuss and supervise the progress of voter registration. At the same time, it is also necessary to have accurate population data in order to correctly determine the number of representatives at all levels and the proportion of their distribution, and to ensure that all voters can participate in the election according to law. This is the main reason for conducting a national population census and registration. Secondly, population census and registration work is of great importance to large-scale economic and cultural construction. Our country's economic and cultural construction work will increasingly become planned. The more strict planning is required, the more accurate calculations are required. People and their needs are the main objects of calculation. Only by accurately counting the population can we more accurately formulate our construction plans, how much coal should be mined each year, how much steel should be smelted, how much cotton should be planted, how much cloth should be woven, how many new factories should be built, how much cultivated land should be expanded, and how many schools and hospitals should be established, so that planning can be more grounded. Over the past three years, governments at all levels have conducted preliminary population surveys through land reform and other mass movements. Moreover, many of our specific policies, such as distributing land according to population and stipulating tax exemption points for agricultural tax based on population size, have made people willing to report population figures truthfully and without concealment. This has made the figures we obtain each year gradually approach the actual situation, exceeding the old figure of 475 million that has been used in our country for a long time. However, these population materials and figures are still not comprehensive and accurate enough, so it is necessary to conduct a unified and scientific national population census and registration. As a modern country, this is very necessary.
    The basic principles of this national population census and registration work are two: one is accuracy, and the other is ease of implementation. Only by achieving accuracy, avoiding duplication and omission, and being comprehensive and reliable can the resulting figures have value for use. Only by being simple and easy to implement, making it easy for cadres to grasp, and making it easy for the masses to implement, both in line with our country's current actual situation and without hindering production, can the goal of accuracy be achieved. This must mean that only the standard time for calculation is stipulated, and it is not required that the survey be conducted throughout the country at the same time; the principle of permanent residents should be adopted during the survey, and each person must be registered as a permanent resident in one place, and only allowed to register in one place, in order to avoid omission and duplication; the survey items are also stipulated to be very simple, only investigating four items: name, gender, age, and ethnicity. It is also stipulated that no investigator is allowed to arbitrarily add items, and the more complex statistical work is handled by the county and city.
    In order to complete this arduous task, leading cadres at all levels must be conscientious and responsible, and do a good job in various preparations. In the process of the work, several main links should be grasped. The first is to ensure that the population census and registration work is carried out simultaneously with the grassroots election work, establish survey stations according to the election areas divided by the grassroots elections, and mobilize the masses in the electoral districts to go to register within the prescribed time. While registering the population, register voters, and at the same time review the qualifications of voters in a manner of mass discussion. This can not only save staff and reduce the trouble of repeated surveys, but also organize mass discussions to make the review of voter qualifications fair and reasonable. Secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in propaganda and explain the important significance of population census and registration work to the broad masses. In particular, it should be publicized that the purpose of our population survey is to prepare for the general election and to provide accurate population figures for the country's economic and cultural construction, so that every person can enthusiastically and consciously support this work. Thirdly, cadres must be carefully trained. All cadres engaged in general election work should study various documents and forms for population census and registration. If manpower is insufficient, other cadres and personnel should also be planned to participate, so that everyone can fully recognize this glorious task; not only should they be familiar with the survey items and requirements, familiar with the survey forms, and able to fill out the forms correctly, but they should also understand the population situation in the area to be surveyed as much as possible in advance. Fourthly, it is necessary to strengthen inspection work and prevent bureaucratic phenomena. Do not just direct others to conduct surveys, and then collect the forms after the survey is completed, but should promptly check and supervise. The appropriateness of the completion of the survey forms should be spot-checked and verified, and errors should be corrected immediately.
    The national population census and registration work is a major event and a scientific undertaking that our country has never carried out in thousands of years. Governments at all levels and the people of the whole country should enthusiastically participate in and conscientiously do this work in accordance with the instructions of the State Council in order to obtain accurate national population figures. Our country is the most populous country in the world, and the announcement of the accurate national population figures is the announcement of the great strength of our people and the great strength of the world's peace and democracy camp. Let us all mobilize and do a good job in the national population census and registration work!

    认真做好全国人口调查登记工作
    中央人民政府内务部宣传组
    中央人民政府政务院发出了“为准备普选进行全国人口调查登记的指示”，同时并制定了“全国人口调查登记办法”。决定于一九五三年内，在各地基层选举工作进行的同时，举行全国人口调查登记，这是一个很重要的措施。它在当前最直接的目的与意义，就是为普选作好准备。在即将到来的全国各地的普选工作中，首先应该做好选民登记的工作。中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示上说：“不能让一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利，也不能让一个反动分子或未经改变成份的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的选举权利”。要能做到这一点，当然需要发动群众，使大家认识选举的重要性和选举权利的庄严性，由群众来讨论与监督选民登记工作的进行。同时也必须要有确实的人口材料，才能正确地决定各级人民代表的名额及其分配的比例，并争取全体选民都能依法参加选举。这就是为什么要举办全国人口调查登记的主要原因。其次，人口调查登记工作，对于大规模的经济建设与文化建设，有着重大的关系。我们国家的经济文化建设工作，将日益走向计划化。而越要求有严格的计划，也就越要求有准确的计算。人和人的需要，就是主要的计算对象。只有统计清楚了有多少人口，才能更准确地订出我们的建设计划，每年应该开采多少煤，炼多少钢，种多少棉花，织多少布，新建多少工厂，扩大多少耕地，办多少学校和医院，才能计划得更有根据。三年来，各级人民政府通过土地改革及其他群众运动，做了初步的人口调查工作。又由于我们的许多具体政策，如按人口分土地，依人口的多寡规定农业税的免征点等，都使人民乐于按实际情况无隐瞒地报出人口数字。这就使我们每年所得到的数字逐渐接近实际，超出了我国从来所沿用的四亿七千五百万的旧数字。但这些人口材料和数字仍然是不够全面和不够准确的，故必须再进行统一的科学的全国人口调查登记。作为一个现代的国家，这样作是非常必要的。
    此次全国人口调查登记工作的基本原则有二，一在准确，一在易行。只有做到准确，做到不重复，不遗漏，做到全面和确实，才能使所得的数字有使用的价值。也只有简便易行，使干部容易掌握，群众乐于实行，既合乎我国目前的实际情况，又不致妨碍生产，才能达到准确的目的。这就必须是，只规定计算的标准时间，而不强求全国在同一时间去进行调查；调查时以常住人口为原则，每人必须在一个地方登记为常住人口，并只许在一个地方登记，以做到不遗漏与不重复；调查的项目也规定得很简单，只调查姓名、性别、年龄、民族四项。并规定任何调查者均不准随意增加项目，比较繁难的统计工作一律由县、市办理。
    为了完成这一艰巨的任务，各级领导干部必须认真负责，做好各项准备工作。在工作的进行中，应该抓住几个主要的环节。首先是必须使人口调查登记的工作与基层选举工作同时进行，按基层选举所划分的选举区域设立调查站，动员选区内群众按规定时间前往登记。一面登记人口，一面登记选民，并同时用群众公议的方式审查选民的资格。这不但可以节省工作人员，减少往返调查多次的麻烦，而且可以组织群众的讨论，以使选民资格的审查达到公平合理。其次必须做好宣传工作，把人口调查登记工作的重要意义向广大群众解释清楚。特别是应该宣传：我们调查人口的目的在于准备普选，在于为国家的经济文化建设提供准确的人口数字，使每个人民都能热烈地自觉地支持这一工作。其三，必须认真训练干部。凡从事普选工作的干部都应学习人口调查登记的各种文件与表式。如人手不够，还应有计划地吸收其他干部与人员来参加，使大家充分认识这一个光荣的任务；不但熟悉调查的项目与要求，熟悉调查表格，会正确地填表，而且对所去调查的地区的人口状况也要尽可能地事先加以了解。其四，必须加强检查工作，防止官僚主义的现象。不要只管指挥别人去调查，等调查完毕把表格收回来完事，而应及时加以检查督促。对于调查表格的填写是否恰当，尤应加以抽查核对，发现错误要立即纠正。
    全国人口调查登记工作是一件大事，是我国几千年来从来未曾进行过的科学的事业，各级人民政府和全国人民应该按着政务院的指示，热烈参加并认真做好这一工作，以求得出正确的全国人口数字。我国是全世界人口最多的国家，全国人口准确数字的宣布，是我们人民的伟大力量的宣布，是世界和平民主阵营的伟大力量的宣布。让我们大家动员起来，把全国人口调查登记工作作好！
