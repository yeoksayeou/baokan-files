The Shenyang Chemical Plant (hereinafter referred to as Party A)'s electrolytic workshop and evaporation workshop projects, constructed last year, were contracted by the Shenyang Engineering Office of the Jilin Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as Party B). Because the relations between Party A and Party B were very poor, it greatly affected the project's progress and quality, causing serious waste.

Both Party A and Party B had departmentalism in this project. When preparing and revising the contract budget, Party B tried to ask for as much as possible, and Party A tried to give as little as possible. The contract was not finalized until the project was nearing completion. During the construction process, the contract was even used as a tool to coerce the other party, and work was once stopped for three days due to a dispute. Regarding the material supply issue, the project stipulated that materials were to be supplied by Party A. When a certain material could not be supplied in time, Party B would write a work stoppage report and ask Party A to sign it, even though there was other work that could be done. For some materials, although the quality was not good, they could still be utilized after processing, but Party B did not work with Party A to find ways to process and utilize them. Regarding project quality, the lack of unity and cooperation between Party A and Party B also caused some rework and waste. There were also other specific issues, and disputes often arose without principle because each side wanted to gain some advantage.

Due to these long-term quarrels, some cadres became emotional, causing great losses to the work. For example, the construction site director and the head of the capital construction department did not speak to each other for months because of disagreements. Party A suggested that Party B send someone to be responsible for managing materials, but Party B considered this "interference in internal affairs." The relationship between the site representative and the construction worker on the construction site was even worse. When the site representative found that the gravel had not been washed clean before being mixed with cement and stopped it, the construction worker told the workers, "Next time he comes, hit him with a shovel!" Sometimes, when the project quality was not good and Party A asked Party B to rework, the construction worker would gather several workers around the site representative to argue while continuing construction.

The cause of this bad situation is also related to the improper handling of certain issues by the leading comrades of the Northeast Chemical Bureau. When dealing with certain disputes, instead of starting from the actual situation and distinguishing between right and wrong, they adopted a method of equal burden for both Party A and Party B, which prevented the complete resolution of the relationship between Party A and Party B.

Last year's project in the factory was greatly affected due to the poor relationship between Party A and Party B. Although Party B's personnel have been transferred this year, the installation quota has not yet been negotiated and formulated, and some specific issues have not been clarified. The project plans for January and February of this year have not been completed. Therefore, both Party A and Party B must conduct ideological criticism and establish necessary systems to thoroughly improve the relationship between the two parties and ensure this year's project progress and quality.

### 沈阳化工厂工程甲乙双方关系不好  工程进度迟缓质量低劣

    沈阳化工厂工程甲乙双方关系不好
    工程进度迟缓质量低劣
    沈阳化工厂（下称甲方）去年修建的电解场房与蒸发场房工程，由吉林工程公司沈阳工程处（下称乙方）承包，因为甲乙双方关系搞得很不好，对工程进度和质量影响很大，造成了严重的浪费现象。
    这项工程的甲乙双方都存在着本位主义思想。在编制及修正包工预算时，乙方尽量多要，甲方就尽量少给，到要完工时才把包工合同修订完毕。在施工过程中，甚至把合同作为要挟对方的工具，并曾因为一项争执而致停工三天。在材料供应问题上，工程用料规定由甲方供给，当某项材料不能及时供应时，虽然还有其他工作可做，乙方也写停工报告，要甲方签字。另有一些材料，质量虽然不好，但加工后仍可以利用，而乙方也不与甲方共同想办法加以处理与利用。在工程质量上，由于甲乙双方不能团结合作，也造成一些返工浪费现象。还有一些其他的具体问题，由于彼此都想占一些便宜，也常引起无原则的纠纷。
    由于在以上这些问题上长期争吵不休，竟至发展到某些干部意气用事，使工作受到很大损失。如工地主任与基本建设科长因为闹意见，几个月见了面都不讲话；甲方建议乙方派一个人负责掌管材料，乙方认为这是“干涉内政”；在施工现场上，工地代表与施工员之间的感情更坏，当工地代表发现石子没有洗净就打洋灰而加以制止时，施工员就对工人说：“下次他再来，拿铁锹锹他！”有时因工程质量不好，甲方要求乙方返工时，施工员竟一面叫几个工人围住工地代表争吵，一面仍继续施工。
    造成这样恶劣情况的原因，也与东北化工局领导同志对双方某些问题的处理不当有关，在处理某些纠纷时，不是从实际情况出发，分清是非责任，而是采取甲乙双方平均负担的办法，使得甲乙双方关系不能彻底解决。
    该厂去年工程由于甲乙双方关系搞不好受到很大影响，今年乙方人员虽已调动，但安装定额还未协商制订出来，有一些具体问题还未弄清楚，今年一、二月份工程计划都没有完成。因此甲乙双方还必须从思想上进行批判，建立起必要的制度，以彻底搞好双方关系，保证今年工程进度和质量。
