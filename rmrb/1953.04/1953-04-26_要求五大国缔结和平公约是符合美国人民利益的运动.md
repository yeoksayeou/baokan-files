    Demanding the Five Great Powers Conclude a Peace Pact is a Movement That Conforms to the Interests of the American People
    United States Louis Huitton
    Throughout history, the great desire of the world's people has been to eliminate war and the threat of war. To prevent war or to end it permanently, many kinds of groups and organizations have been established over the centuries. These organizations were national in scope and limited to a small number of leaders. But today's peace organizations are new in nature and have undergone important changes in form. The most important change is the active participation of the masses of people around the world.
    Cultural progress is not due to successive wars, but rather despite them. Human creativity will never be deterred by the destructiveness that exists alongside it. The common desire to live and build forces destructive elements to give way, and thus, people advance step by step in the achievement of happiness.
    Today, the evil forces of war are rampant again. But the people of the world have decided not to be dragged into a pointless war of cultural destruction, and this determination is expressed in the world's demand for peace. This determination is so strong that today there is an unprecedented organizational form in history to express this sentiment.
    The people of all countries have repeatedly voiced their calls through their representatives on this very important issue. Worldwide, regional, and national congresses and conferences have expressed the desire for peace of more than one billion people. People are willing to face and overcome all difficulties to express their wishes, which fully demonstrates their profound understanding.
    The most prominent aspect of the understanding possessed by ordinary people is their seeking a straightforward solution to the problems that cause world tensions. This solution is summarized in the declaration calling for the five great powers to conclude a peace pact; that is to say: to hold a round table conference, and to use negotiation and agreement to resolve all issues. When studying this solution, each country can decide for itself whether doing so is in the interests of its own people. Does this refer to the interests of a certain group or certain special groups? No! The answer must be that it conforms to the interests of all the people, regardless of class, religion, politics, social status, or beliefs and opinions, because people of all races around the world have repeatedly expressed their strong desire for peace.
    What does this demand mean for the American people? Is peace in our interests? These questions must be answered from the standpoint of all strata of the American people.
    At the beginning of the Korean War in 1950-1951, people did not take the situation too seriously. Many people saw it as an opportunity to find a better job, a way to cope with rising living costs; some saw it as a "police action" to stop "Russian aggression"; and some saw it as the first step in launching World War III.
    However, the past two years have caused a tremendous shift in the thinking of the American people. As the number of war casualties continues to increase, and as many families receive news of the deaths of loved ones, more and more questions are being raised. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that the living and working conditions of the people have not improved, but have deteriorated sharply. The huge profits obtained by large monopoly capital from the blood of American youth are particularly noteworthy.
    People also understand that the United States is not safe in a third world war. People are increasingly aware that years of construction achievements will be destroyed, not to mention the deaths of family members, especially women, children, and the elderly. Mothers often say: "I don't want my children to suffer the disasters of war." This is a matter of great concern to all mothers.
    The American people have begun to see the predatory and cruel nature of this war. Deeply rooted in the American tradition is a contempt for acts of aggression. These questions are being raised one by one: "What are we doing in Korea?" "How exactly did those countries provoke us?" As a result, the true nature of this war is becoming increasingly clear: it is a war that violates the interests of the American people.
    The facts of conducting germ warfare and using poison gas have been revealed. The violation of the Geneva Convention in the massacre of thousands of unarmed prisoners of war and the act of supporting the most reactionary and corrupt government in the world have shocked the conscience of the people. These actions have turned the American government into the most hated government in the world. This certainly cannot be said to be in the interests of the American people.
    From an economic point of view, is this in the interests of the American people? Our merchants cannot enter the world's largest markets. We have lost a trading area that accounts for more than one-third of the world's area and has the largest customers. At the same time, our warehouses are piled high with unsold goods. Many factories have stopped work or are shortening working hours. Many small businesses have been and are being forced into bankruptcy. The end result is that tens of thousands of workers will lose their jobs, and many small businesses will be completely ruined.
    On the one hand, this situation is developing; on the other hand, the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe need large quantities of goods, and they want to conduct trade on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.
    As for America's professionals and intellectuals, they are suffering not only from various economic conditions, but also from the extreme social unfreedom they feel personally. For example, a physician whose duty is to treat diseases finds himself forced to become a member of the team that destroys life. He cannot exchange knowledge and ideas with places that have new medical methods and technologies—such as painless childbirth methods, etc.; this is not because the knowledge is inaccessible, but because the government prevents him from going abroad and prevents him from accepting knowledge from those countries that apply new methods and technologies. He feels like a professional prisoner, not a contributor to the accumulation of human knowledge and experience.
    Various new art forms have developed, bringing world-shaking changes to art and art forms. For example, new stage design art, new drama forms, new and improved film equipment, etc. However, American artists cannot study these new developments and apply them to the education and entertainment of the people. On the contrary, American artists can only bury their talents and follow the policies formulated by a small group of warmongers. In the shady work they are asked to do, their art becomes vulgarized, which is against the will of the artists and degrades American art and culture to a low level.
    No group of people can be so transcendent as to isolate themselves from the world. This is equivalent to the cessation of growth and development. In order to continue to develop the budding arts and culture in our young and vibrant tradition, there is a need for freedom of thought and communication. Due to America's war policy, every artist has to use his art to adapt to that policy. This is true in drama, music, film, painting, and other art forms. Such a policy destroys the initiative and freedom of art. Artists must restore their initiative and creativity.
    What about the ethnic minorities in America? Their lives are becoming more and more miserable. Exploitation and isolation have intensified, cases of persecution of blacks and anti-Semitism have emerged one after another, and atrocities of hatred against other ethnic minorities have become daily occurrences. However, in other parts of the world, in the so-called "East," ethnic minorities have gained equality and full respect.
    American workers are faced with the painful reality of a sharp decline in living standards and bosses constantly lowering wages and increasing workloads. They are about to exhaust their savings over the years. Under the dual oppression of the unbearable burden of taxes and the rapid rise in living costs, they can hardly support their families.
    On the other hand, the large monopoly capital of Rockefeller, Morgan, DuPont, Ford, etc., has obtained unprecedentedly huge profits, their total profits exceeding 42 billion US dollars last year. In other words, the blood of our youth, the prestige of artists, and the sweat of workers are all sacrificed for the benefit of Wall Street speculators and their ilk. Is this in the interests of the American people? The answer is of course no. This is in the interests of the wealthy, but it brings poverty to the people. The evidence that this war is for the benefit of the American wealthy rulers is provided in "Business Week," the mouthpiece of monopoly capital, which says: "A ceasefire would make the anticipated business downturn inevitable." It goes on to explain that the interruption of the Korean armistice negotiations will increase the need for manpower and military equipment, thereby improving the situation in the scope of commercial activities and avoiding the arrival of the expected recession. Another mouthpiece of the wealthy, "Newsweek," admits that Eisenhower's initial batch of mandates and his actions show the nature of his government more clearly than all of his campaign speeches. The remarks of these publications clearly reflect who has benefited from this cruel and predatory war and who has paid the price.
    People from all walks of life must consider this tragic situation. What should be done to return to the situation that is in the interests of the majority of the American people? How best to view this issue? Should we continue to support policies that are against the interests of the people? What is the situation now? How is it possible to end world tensions?
    There are many examples of solving problems through consultation. In families, in social groups, in religious groups, and in political groups, various problems are solved through peaceful consultation, debate, and agreement. People despise the use of force to resolve these disputes. It is in these consultations that we live a peaceful national life.
    Can't this same spirit of consultation be applied to international occasions? Obviously, it can and must be applied. The people of the world recognize this fact and have put forward to the five major powers the demand to solve major disputes through talks. In fact, in the United States, the spirit of discussion is part of the tradition of national life.
    Professionals and artists, proceeding from their own interests and development, must firmly demand such a practice. They do not have to do it alone, but can also seek the support of all those who are directly or indirectly restricted by the existing restrictions. For example, doctors can get the support of patients, teachers can get the support of students and parents, and artists can get the support of audiences, listeners, and their students. Their only wish is to maintain academic freedom and the freedom to carry out their chosen social welfare work. Organizing such a team is enough to represent the noble spirit of civilization.
    This collective action is particularly beneficial to farmers. This can promote the return of young people to farms. It can alleviate the heavy burden of the elderly who work hard for our lives and our children. It can enrich agricultural production and sell it to countries that need our agricultural products, thereby improving the lives of American farmers and the people of other countries. Preventing famine and stabilizing the family lives of our farmers is very important. Agriculture is the nation's bread basket, and farmers can only produce the food that humans need from fertile soil if they have peace. Our farmers have a bright future, but the achievement of this bright future depends on the collective action of striving for peaceful consultation and the development of trade by the five major powers.
    Workers themselves have no other way to make a living, and they must improve their working conditions and family situation through their own organizations demanding increased trade relations and economic exchanges. Workers are carrying out extensive discussions in factories and in their own groups on this extremely important issue. The easing of world tensions can actually bring hundreds of thousands, even millions, of jobs to American workers, because the demand for goods and services is so great.
    The results of this collective discussion and its influence can call on the masses to support the solution of world tensions through peaceful consultation. This is not the line-up of any narrow political group, but the broadest expression of mass sentiment that bursts out for its own interests and the interests of all mankind. Therefore, this is not a question of political parties or political beliefs, but only a matter of how to obtain a peaceful and happy life and to envision the future for the next generation of children.
    What is preventing the major powers from holding talks to resolve differences? There are many facts in our own history that prove that such meetings can be held.
    Therefore, the task facing the American people is to promote a ceasefire in Korea—to stop the senseless slaughter, to stop the bloodshed, and to let the soldiers go home.
    Then, we must demand that our government respond to the appeal of the five major powers and conduct consultations on the current world situation in order to seek a reasonable solution to the disputes.
    Merchants, professional artists, workers, and farmers organizing to seek the support of the people can promote the easing of the current world tensions and establish a heroic and historical achievement for the American people and the people of the world; the question is whether we are willing to undertake this task given to us by history? Now is the time to act.
    The resolution of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference on demanding the five major powers to conclude a peace pact says: "Such a peace pact can stop the war that is currently underway and dispel the terrible shadow of a third world war for mankind. It can eliminate the terror of germ warfare and atomic bombs. It can release the heavy burden of armaments from the backs of the people, and eliminate trade barriers so that the people can freely exchange the fruits of their labor. It can make the people's land and freedom inviolable, open the road to national independence for all people, and enable the people of every country to live the life they choose. It can restore the United Nations to its original purpose as a place for countries to consult and reach agreements.
    "In a peaceful environment, life will be rich and happy; soldiers will return to their homes; children will be safe; mothers will no longer shed tears. Labor and skills, as well as the natural wealth of each country, will be used for the benefit of mankind rather than for destruction. The people of every country will learn to understand and respect the rich culture of their neighbors. Peace is the guarantee of food, clothing, and freedom."
    The situation has changed. The People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have made new concessions in Korea. This change in the situation has made it possible to end the failure in Korea, to turn the nightmare into the ideal of a peaceful life and a bright future, to establish a temporary agreement in the Far East, and to restore a peaceful and friendly life.
    Peace-loving people all over the world have enthusiastically responded to this new peace proposal. It has aroused new hope for an immediate resolution of the issue of prisoners of war. In fact, this hope expresses the desire of all countries participating in the Korean War to eliminate international tensions by successfully resolving this issue.
    The declaration sent to the governments of the five major powers must have a motivating effect on the work of striving for world peace. The people of the world, especially the American people, must re-propose the demand to resolve all disputes through consultation. There is no better time than now to mobilize the people to enthusiastically support this demand. There is no doubt that the people of the world will give their sympathy and support to this consultation. The people of the world have expressed their advocacy for peace, and the governments of all countries must seek peace in accordance with the wishes of the people. Peace means an infinitely beautiful life, it means friendship between the people of all countries, and it means the end of misfortune and death. Yes, demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact is in the interests of the American people, and it is also in the interests of the people of the world.

    要求五大国缔结和平公约是符合美国人民利益的运动
    美国  路易士·惠吞
    历代以来世界人民的伟大愿望，一直是消灭战争和消灭战争的威胁。为了要阻止战争或者永久地终止战争，在数世纪中间成立过许多种团体和组织。这些组织的范围是民族性的，而且只限于少数的领导人物。但是今天的和平组织在性质上是新的，在形式上也有了重要的变化。这种最主要的变化，就是全世界人民群众的积极参加。
    文化之所以不断地进步，并不是因为一次次战争，而是因为置那些战争于不顾。人类的创造性是决不会被同时存在的破坏性所吓倒的。要生活和要建设的共同愿望使破坏性的因素不得不让步，因此，人民在幸福的成就中一步步前进。
    今天，战争的恶势力又复猖獗了。但是世界人民已经决定不要被拖进毁灭文化的无谓的战争里去，就在全世界人民的要求和平中把这个决心表现出来。这个决心是这样的坚强，今天已经有了历史上空前的表达这种情绪的组织形式。
    世界各国人民对于这个非常重要的问题不止一次地通过他们的代表，发出了他们的呼声。全世界的、区域性的和各国的大会和会议已经表达了十亿以上人民对和平的要求。人们甘愿面临和克服一切困难来表达他们的愿望，这就充分说明了人们的深刻的认识。
    普通的人们所具有的认识方面最突出的一点，就是他们对于造成世界紧张局势的问题，谋求直截了当的解决。这办法概括在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言里；就是说：开圆桌会议，用谈判和协议来解决一切问题。在研究这解决方案的时候，每个国家可以自己决定这样做是否符合于本国人民的利益。这可是指着某一集团或者某些特殊集团的利益吗？不是的！答案一定是符合于全体人民的利益，不管什么样的阶级、什么样的宗教、政治、社会或信仰和见解，因为全世界各种族的人民，都不止一次地表达了他们要求和平的强烈愿望。
    这个要求对于美国人民来说，意味着什么呢？和平符合于我们的利益吗？这些问题是要站在美国所有各阶层人民的立场上来解答的。
    在一九五○——一九五一年间朝鲜战争开始的时候，人们对局势是看得不太严肃的。许多人认为这是一个找求较好职业的机会，是一个应付生活费上涨的方法；有的认为这是阻止“俄国侵略”的一种“警察行动”；有的就把它看作发动第三次世界大战的第一步。
    但是，过去两年却在美国人民的思想上造成了巨大的转变。由于战争伤亡人数的不断增加，由于许多家庭获悉亲人死亡的消息，愈来愈多的问题提出来了。同时，愈来愈明显的是：人民的生活和工作的条件并没有改善，反而急剧恶化下去。大垄断资本从美国青年鲜血中所取得的巨额利润，又是特别引人注意的。
    人们也很了解，在一个第三次大战里，美国并不是安全的。人们愈来愈了解，多少年来的建设成就会被摧毁，更不用说家属，尤其是妇女、儿童和老年人的丧亡了。母亲们常常说：“我不愿意我的孩子受到战争的灾祸。”这是所有的母亲极为关心的一个问题。
    美国人民开始看清了这个战争的掠夺性和残酷性。深藏在美国传统中的，是对侵略行动的鄙视。这些问题一一地提出来了：“我们在朝鲜做什么？”“那些国家到底是怎样惹了我们的？”于是，这个战争的真实性质愈来愈明显了，它是一个违反美国人民利益的战争。
    进行细菌战和使用毒气的事实，透露出来了。违反日内瓦公约屠杀了成千的手无寸铁的战俘以及支持世界上最反动最腐化的政府的行为，震惊了人民的良心。这些行为使美国政府变成了世界上最可恨的政府。这决不能说是符合美国人民的利益的。
    从经济的观点说，这可是符合于美国人民利益的吗？我们的商人不能进入世界上最广大的市场。我们失去了占全世界面积三分之一以上、有着最大主顾的贸易地区。在同时，我们仓库中堆满了卖不出去的货物。许多工厂停了工或者在缩短工时。许多小商人已经而且还在被迫破产。最后的结果是成千上万的工人要失业，许多的小商人要完全遭殃。
    在一方面，这种局势发展着；在另一方面，苏联、中国和东欧人民民主国家却需要着大量的货物，他们要进行在平等互惠基础上的贸易。
    至于美国的自由职业者和知识分子，不仅由于种种经济条件，而且由于切身感觉到的社会的极度不自由，他们也是在受苦难。例如以治病为天职的医师，发觉自己是被迫成为毁灭生命的队伍中的一员。他不能跟有着新医疗法和技术——像无痛分娩法等等的地方，交流知识和思想；这并不是因为知识无法获得，而是因为政府阻止他出国，阻止他接受从那些应用新方法与技术的国家传来的知识。他觉得自己正是一个职业上的囚犯，而不是一个对人类的知识和经验的积累有贡献的人。
    各种新的艺术形式发展起来，给艺术和艺术形式带来了震惊世界的变化。例如新的布景艺术、新的戏剧形式、新的改进的电影设备等等。然而美国的艺术家们却不能去研究这些新的发展，而应用于人民的教育和娱乐方面。相反的，美国的艺术家们只能埋没天才，去遵行一小群战争贩子们所制定的政策。在要求他们来干的阴暗的作业中，他们的艺术走向庸俗化，这是违反艺术家的意志，而使美国的艺术文化贬落到低下的水平的。
    任何一群人都不能超然到竟让自己与世隔绝的。这样一来就等于生长与发展的停止。为了继续发展我们年青活泼的传统中正在萌芽的艺术和文化，需要着思想和交流的自由。由于美国的战争政策，每一个艺术家不得不把自己的艺术用于适应那种政策。在戏剧、音乐、电影、绘画以及其他各种艺术形式方面都是如此。这样的一种政策摧毁了艺术的积极性和自由。艺术家必须重新恢复他们的积极性和创造性。
    美国的少数民族怎样呢？他们的生活愈来愈悲惨了。剥削与隔离变本加厉，迫害黑人和排犹的案件层出不穷，仇恨其他少数民族的暴行变成了日常事故。然而，在世界的其他部分，在所谓“东方”，少数民族却获得了平等与充分的尊重。
    美国的工人们面对着生活水平急剧下降和老板们不断压低工资加重工作的痛苦事实。他们快要耗尽历年的积蓄。在难以忍受的捐税重担和生活费用急速上涨的双重压迫下，他们几乎不能维持他们的家庭了。
    在另一方面，洛克菲勒、摩根、杜邦、福特等等大垄断资本，却获得了空前未闻的巨额利润，去年它们的赢利总额超过四百二十亿美元。换句话说，我们青年的鲜血、艺术家的威望和工人的血汗，都为华尔街投机分子及其一伙的利益而牺牲了。这是符合于美国人民利益的吗？回答当然是否定的。这符合于富豪的利益，却给人民带来了贫穷。这战争为着美国富豪统治者的利益的证据，就在垄断资本的御用刊物“商业周刊”上提供出来，它说：“停战会使预想中的商业不景气变成必然。”接着又说明朝鲜停战谈判的中断，将使人力和军备的需要更大，从而在商业活动范围改善情况，避免预料的衰退的来临。另一个富豪们的喉舌“新闻周刊”承认说：艾森豪威尔最初发出的一批委任状和他的行动，比他的全部竞选演说更明确地显示出他的政府的性质。这些刊物的言论非常明白地反映出：在这个残酷的掠夺的战争之中，究竟谁得到了利益，谁付出了代价。
    各阶层的人民都要考虑一下这个可悲的局势了。应当怎么办才可以回到那些符合于美国大多数人民利益的情况呢？最好怎样来看这个问题呢？我们难道继续支持违反人民利益的政策吗？现在是怎样的情况呢？怎样才有终止世界紧张局势的可能呢？
    有很多通过协商解决问题的例子。在家庭里，在社会团体里，在宗教团体里，在政治团体里，各种问题都是通过和平的商讨、辩论和协议的方式而获得解决的。人们都鄙视着用武力来解决这些纠纷。就在种种的协商中间，我们过着和平的国民生活。
    这同一的协商精神不能应用于国际场合吗？显然它是能够而且必须应用的。世界人民认识到这个事实，便向五大国提出了通过会谈方式解决主要争端的要求。实在说，在美国，讨论的精神就是国民生活传统的一部分。
    自由职业者和艺术家的队伍从本身的利益和发展出发，必须坚决要求这样的做法。他们不必单独来干，还可以求得所有直接或间接受着现有的限制的人们的支持。例如：医师可以得到病人的支持，教师可以得到学生和家长的支持，艺术家可以得到观众、听众和他们的学生们的支持。他们的唯一愿望，就是保持学术的自由以及进行自己的选定的社会福利工作的自由。组织这样的队伍足以代表文明的高贵精神。
    这种集体行动，是特别有利于农民的。这样可以促成青年人重返农庄。可以减轻为我们的生活和我们的孩子们而辛劳的老人们的重负。可以使农业生产丰富起来，卖给那些需要我们农产品的国家，从而提高美国农民和其他国家人民的生活。防止饥荒和安定我们农民家庭生活是非常重要的事。农业是国家的面包篮，而农民有了和平才能从沃土生产人类需要的食粮。我们的农民有着光明的未来，但这光明的未来的取得，是依靠于争取五大国和平协商和发展贸易的集体行动的。
    工人本身是没有其他谋生方法的，他们必须通过自己的组织要求增进贸易关系和经济交流，才能改善他们的工作条件和家庭情况。对于这个极其重要的问题，工人们在工场中，在自己的团体里，展开着广泛的讨论。世界紧张局势的缓和，实际上就可以给美国工人带来几十万、几百万件的工作，因为商品与劳务的需要是如此的巨大。
    这种集体的讨论及其影响所造成的结果，可以号召群众支持通过和平协商来解决世界紧张局势的办法。这并不是任何狭隘的政治集团的阵容，这是为本身利益和全人类利益而迸发的群众情绪的最广泛的表现。因此，这完全不是政党的或政治信仰的问题，却只是如何取得和平幸福的生活并为下一代孩子们的未来而设想的事情。
    有什么东西阻碍着大国会谈来解决歧见呢？在我们自己的历史上就有很多的事实证明，这样的会议是可以开成的。
    因此，美国人民所面临的任务是：促成朝鲜停战——停止无谓的屠杀，停止流血，让兵士们回家。
    接着就是要求我们的政府答复对五大国的呼吁，进行关于目前世界局势的商谈，以求得争端的合理解决。
    商人、职业艺术家、工人和农民组织起来找求人民的支持，是能够促成目前世界紧张局势缓和的结果，而给美国人民和全世界人民树立一个英雄的、历史性的功迹的；问题还是：我们是否愿意承担历史所给予我们的这个任务？现在是行动的时候了。
    在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议关于要求五大国缔结和平公约的决议里说：“这样一个和平公约可以制止目前正在进行的战争，并为人类驱散第三次世界大战可怖的阴影。它可以消除细菌战和原子弹的恐怖。它可以从人民的背上释去军备的重负，并扫除贸易障碍，使人民能够自由地交换他们的劳动果实。它可以使人民的土地和自由不受别人侵犯，为一切人民开辟民族独立的道路，并使每一个国家的人民能够过自己选择的生活。它可以使联合国恢复它原来的宗旨，成为各国商谈和取得协议的地方。
    “在和平的环境中，生活将丰富而快乐；兵士们回到自己的家中；儿童们得到安全；母亲们不再流泪。劳动和技能、以及每个国家的自然财富，将用于人类的福利而不用于破坏。每个国家的人民将学会了解并尊重他们邻居的丰富文化。和平就是衣食和自由的保障。”
    情况已经转变了。中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经在朝鲜做了新的让步。这一情况的转变，使结束在朝鲜的失败，从梦魇转向和平生活的理想和光明的未来，在远东成立临时协议，以及重新恢复和平友爱的生活都有了可能。
    全世界爱好和平的人民，热烈地响应了这个新的和平建议。唤起了立即解决战俘问题的新希望。事实上，这个希望就表现着所有参加朝鲜战争的国家要由这一问题的顺利解决进而消除国际紧张局势的愿望。
    送给五大国政府的宣言，必须在争取世界和平的工作上有激励的作用。全世界人民尤其是美国人民必须重新提出通过协商方式解决全部争端的要求。发动人民热烈支持这个要求，再没有比目前更好的时机了。毫无疑问，全世界人民对于这种协商都将寄予他们的同情和拥护。全世界人民表示了和平的主张，而全世界各国的政府必须按照人民的愿望来觅取和平。和平意味着无限美好的生命，意味着各国人民间的友爱，意味着不幸和死亡的终止。是的，要求五大国缔结和平公约符合于美国人民的利益，也符合于全世界人民的利益。
