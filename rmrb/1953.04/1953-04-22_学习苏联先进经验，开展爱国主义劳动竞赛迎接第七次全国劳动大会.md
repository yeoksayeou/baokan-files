    Learn from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union and Launch a Patriotic Labor Competition to Welcome the Seventh National Labor Congress
    Lai Ruoyu
    Our country's planned economic construction has already begun, and the Seventh National Labor Congress will be convened precisely at this time. How should our working class welcome the Seventh National Labor Congress and participate in the state's planned economic construction?
    Planned economic construction is a huge effort by our working class and all working people to build our great motherland and create our own happy lives. To ensure the successful progress of national economic construction, we must summarize and master advanced scientific and technological experience, especially learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has carried out construction for more than 30 years, creating and accumulating much valuable advanced experience, which is of great significance to our economic construction. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: learn from the Soviet Union, accept their advanced experience, and apply it to our economic construction.
    In the three years since liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, precisely because we have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and have the help of Soviet experts, we have achieved great victories in the economy. Under the circumstances of resisting America and aiding Korea, we not only stabilized prices and restored the economy, but also the output of some state-owned enterprises exceeded the highest levels of previous years. However, the highest level of previous years was a backward level; and planned economic construction is to change this backward state, realize national industrialization, and steadily move our great motherland towards a socialist future.
    Struggling for national industrialization is the task of all the people of our country, and first of all the responsibility of our working class. The working class must treat our country's construction with the attitude of being masters of the country.
    During the period of reactionary rule, the working people were exploited, and labor was not for the benefit of the broad masses of people, so it was not valued. Today our labor is for the benefit of the broad masses of people, so labor has become a heroic undertaking. In the three years since liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our working class and the working people of the whole country have been working with the attitude of being masters of the country. This is what has enabled our country's economy to recover and develop rapidly. The living conditions and working conditions of the working class and the working people of the whole country have also been significantly improved with the recovery and development of the national economy. All the measures of our country are, in the final analysis, aimed at improving and protecting the material and cultural welfare of the working class and all working people.
    The level of consciousness of the broad masses of workers in our country is very high. They understand the unity of national interests and personal interests, and they are carrying out labor production with a selfless spirit. However, there are also a small number of people who do not understand this principle. They still retain, to a greater or lesser extent, the selfish mentality of small producers. There will be such people in the future as well. Therefore, helping the working masses to continuously improve their consciousness and raising the backward level to an advanced level is a long-term and arduous task, which must be solved by means of criticism and self-criticism and through labor competition.
    In the Soviet Union, socialist labor competition is the basic method for improving labor productivity. For us, labor competition is also a basic method for carrying out planned economic construction by the state. Of course, labor competition is not simply to strengthen labor intensity, but to learn and promote advanced experience, improve management and administration, and improve labor organization and operating methods in order to improve labor productivity.
    The reason why we can carry out labor competition is because our working class has a high degree of initiative and creativity. Those who hold capitalist views underestimate the level of consciousness of the masses and the strength of the masses. When our country was just liberated, the enemy looked down on us and waited with schadenfreude for us to stumble on financial and economic issues. However, the facts show that everything we did went smoothly, which could not help but alarm them. From the bourgeois point of view, this is a miracle. The reason why we can create such a miracle is because of the collective strength of the masses. "Conservative viewpoints" also underestimate the collective strength of the masses and the creativity and initiative of the working masses. To give full play to this collective strength of the working class and to give full play to the initiative and creativity of the working masses, it is necessary to carry out labor competition. Labor competition is the most concentrated manifestation of the patriotism of the working class.
    In the period when the state's planned economic construction has already begun, our working class must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, further undertake the great and glorious historical task. The upcoming Seventh National Labor Congress should become a general mobilization meeting for our working class at the beginning of the state's planned economic construction. We must highly promote the revolutionary spirit of labor, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, launch a patriotic labor competition, and strive to guarantee the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the state's plan, for the industrialization of the country and our infinitely beautiful future.

### 学习苏联先进经验，开展爱国主义劳动竞赛迎接第七次全国劳动大会

    学习苏联先进经验，开展爱国主义劳动竞赛迎接第七次全国劳动大会
    赖若愚
    我们的国家有计划的经济建设已经开始，第七次全国劳动大会恰恰就将在这个时候召开。我国工人阶级应该怎样迎接第七次全国劳动大会和参加国家有计划的经济建设呢？
    有计划的经济建设是我们工人阶级和全体劳动人民为建设我们伟大的祖国和创造自己幸福的生活而进行的巨大努力。要使国家经济建设能够胜利进行，就必须总结和掌握先进的科学技术经验，特别是学习和推广苏联的先进经验。苏联进行了三十多年的建设，创造和积累了许多宝贵的先进经验，这对我们的经济建设是有巨大意义的。我们必须遵照毛主席的指示：学习苏联，接受他们的先进经验，运用到我们的经济建设中来。
    解放三年来，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，正由于我们学习了苏联的先进经验，而且有苏联专家的帮助，我们在经济上取得了很大的胜利。在抗美援朝的情况下，我们不仅稳定了物价，恢复了经济，而且一部分国营企业的产量还超过了以往年代的最高水平。不过以往年代的最高水平是一个落后的水平；而有计划的经济建设，就是要改变这种落后状态，实现国家工业化，使我们伟大的祖国稳步地走向社会主义的前途。
    为国家工业化而斗争，是我国全体人民的任务，首先是我们工人阶级的责任。工人阶级必须以国家主人翁的态度，对待我们国家的建设事业。
    在反动统治时期，劳动人民是受剥削的，劳动不是为了广大人民的，所以不为人所重视。今天我们的劳动是为了广大人民的，所以劳动就成了英雄的事业。解放三年来，我国工人阶级和全国劳动人民，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，正是以国家主人翁的态度在进行着劳动。这才使我们国家的经济迅速地得到了恢复和发展。工人阶级和全国劳动人民的生活状况和劳动条件，也随着国民经济的恢复和发展，得到显著的改善。我们国家的一切措施，归根结底都是为了提高和保护工人阶级以及全体劳动人民的物质和文化福利的。
    我国广大工人群众的觉悟程度是很高的，他们懂得国家利益和个人利益的一致，他们以忘我的精神进行着劳动生产。但也有一小部分的人还不懂得这个道理，他们还或多或少地保留着小生产者的自私心理。这样的人在将来也会有的。所以帮助工人群众不断地提高他们的觉悟，把落后的水平提高到先进的水平，是一个长期的艰苦的工作，是要以批评和自我批评的方法并通过劳动竞赛来解决的。
    在苏联，社会主义劳动竞赛是提高劳动生产率的基本方法。对我们来说，劳动竞赛也是国家有计划地进行经济建设的基本方法。当然，劳动竞赛并不是单纯地加强劳动强度，而是要学习和推广先进经验，改善经营管理，改善劳动组织和操作方法，以提高劳动生产率。
    我们所以能够开展劳动竞赛，就是因为我们工人阶级具有高度的积极性和创造性。那些抱着资本主义观点的人，对于群众的觉悟程度和群众的力量是估计不足的。当我国刚刚解放的时候，敌人是看不起我们的，并以幸灾乐祸的敌意等着我们在财政经济问题上栽跟头，但是，事实说明，我们的一切都进行得很顺利，这倒不能不使他们惊慌失措。从资产阶级的观点看来，这是一个奇迹。我们所以能够创造这样的奇迹，就是因为有群众的集体的力量。 “保守观点”也是对群众的集体的力量，对工人群众的创造性、积极性估计不足的。要充分发挥工人阶级的这种集体力量，充分发挥工人群众的积极性和创造性，就要开展劳动竞赛。劳动竞赛是工人阶级爱国主义精神的最集中的行动表现。
    我们工人阶级在国家有计划的经济建设已经开始的时期，一定要在毛主席和共产党的领导下，更进一步担负起伟大而光荣的历史任务。即将召开的第七次全国劳动大会，应该成为我国工人阶级在国家有计划的经济建设开始的时候进行总动员的大会。我们要高度地发扬革命的劳动精神，学习苏联的先进经验，展开爱国主义的劳动竞赛，为保证完成和超额完成国家的计划、为国家的工业化和我们无限美好的将来而奋斗。
