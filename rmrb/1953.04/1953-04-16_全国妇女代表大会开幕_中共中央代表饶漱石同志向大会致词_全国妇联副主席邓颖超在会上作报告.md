Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: The Second National Women's Congress of China opened in Huairentang, the capital, on the 15th.

Among the delegates were labor models and activists who had emerged in industrial and agricultural production and various other fields, women from twenty-five ethnic minorities in various minority regions, and women from various democratic strata. Some of them came from the Korean front lines, some from factories where labor competitions were in full swing, some from rural areas where spring plowing and sowing were underway, and some from the Kangzang Plateau and the Mongolian grasslands. A total of 891 delegates attended the congress today, with 244 delegates attending as observers.

The congress opened at 9:00 a.m. The congress elected Song Qingling and 46 others to form the presidium. Subsequently, Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered the opening speech. After elaborating on the important significance of convening this congress, she said: The task of this congress is to summarize the achievements and experiences of the women's movement over the past four years, and to formulate the future direction and tasks of the women's movement. Around this central content, the constitution of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation will be revised, and the executive committee of the Democratic Women's Federation will be re-elected. At the same time, the Chinese delegation to the World Women's Congress to be held in Denmark in June this year will also be elected.

Rao Shushi, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, addressed the congress amid warm applause. After narrating the significant contributions made by the broad masses of Chinese women on all fronts of the motherland, he said: The Communist Party of China and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, have always been extremely concerned about the cause of women's liberation, believing that women's liberation is an inseparable part of the people's liberation, and have often specifically pointed out the path to women's liberation. He said: In the women's liberation movement, there are many complex problems that need to be continuously and gradually resolved. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China hopes that the delegates to this congress will be able to fully exchange various correct and incorrect experiences and lessons, and seriously discuss various working methods that are applicable to different conditions and can be accepted by the masses, so that the work of the women's movement can be improved and benefit national construction. Dong Biwu, Vice-Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, successively addressed the congress, congratulating it on its success.

Subsequently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the New Democratic Youth League of China, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association sent congratulatory messages to the congress.

The congress, presided over by Zhang Yun and others, executive chairmen of the presidium, read out congratulatory messages to the congress from Song Qingling and He Xiangning, honorary chairmen of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and congratulatory telegrams from Vayan Kouznetsova, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee. Vayan Kouznetsova's congratulatory telegram said: "Your tireless participation in the work of building a happy and prosperous new China is a huge contribution to defending world peace. Please extend our sincere love and concern, especially to the wives and mothers of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting against the imperialist aggressors in Korea."

The congress adjourned at 11:20 a.m. and continued at 4:00 p.m.

At the afternoon session, Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a report on "The Basic Summary of the Chinese Women's Movement in the Past Four Years and Future Tasks." She said: With the great victory of the people's revolution in our country and the development of national construction, the status of women has undergone fundamental changes, and women have obtained equal rights with men. Deng Yingchao said: Our great motherland has entered a new historical period, and national construction has begun. Vigorously mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of women, and giving full play to their potential labor force to participate in industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of the motherland's construction, is the central task of the women's movement in the future. In order to achieve this task, in cities, the Democratic Women's Federation must help trade unions do a good job in women workers' work, mobilize and organize women workers to actively participate in the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to improve labor productivity, learn and master advanced technology, save raw materials, and improve product quality. In rural areas, rural working women should be mobilized and encouraged to actively participate in the patriotic production increase movement and, on a voluntary basis, participate in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, learn and improve farming techniques, and make greater achievements than in the past in accumulating manure, selecting seeds, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases, so as to increase the yield per unit area and increase the production of grain and other crops. When mobilizing women to participate in industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to eliminate feudal constraints on women. In all production enterprises, equal pay for equal work between men and women should be gradually implemented, and the special difficulties of women should be gradually resolved. In coordination with the health departments of the People's Government, vigorous publicity and development of child care and maternal and child health work should be carried out, and a large number of midwives in rural areas and nursery workers in factories should be trained. An educational and learning movement among women should be universally launched. Our country is preparing for general elections, and women across the country should warmly support and study the election law, correctly implement the election law, and actively participate in the election movement. Deng Yingchao emphasized that Chinese women should strive to support the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and unite under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and actively participate in the international women's peace and democracy movement.

Deng Yingchao concluded by saying: Let us, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, consolidate our existing achievements, make full use of the experience we have gained, mobilize and organize the broad masses of women across the country to unite with the people of the whole country, and strive to fulfill the tasks given to us by the motherland! Strive for greater achievements in the Chinese women's movement!

The congress adjourned at 6:10 p.m. The report by Vice-Chairman Deng Yingchao will be discussed in groups tomorrow.
