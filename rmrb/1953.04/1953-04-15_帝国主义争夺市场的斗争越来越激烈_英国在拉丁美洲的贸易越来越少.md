The Struggle of Imperialism Intensifies for Markets
British Trade in Latin America Shrinks

The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article by V. Chichkov on the 13th entitled "The Competition Between the United States and Britain in the Latin American Market." Chichkov said: The anxiety expressed by British business circles regarding the prospects of British trade with Latin American countries reflects their desire to resist the pressure from American monopoly capitalists to squeeze out British capital in various Latin American countries.

In the initial years after the war, Latin American countries quickly exhausted their dollar reserves. Britain took advantage of this situation to unfreeze the funds of Latin American countries "frozen" in London banks in order to expand trade with these countries. By the beginning of 1949, British exports to these countries had recovered to pre-war levels. During the same period, U.S. exports to the region decreased.

However, Britain's booming trade with Latin American countries was short-lived. Due to the Korean War and the arms expansion movement, the United States once again purchased large quantities of raw materials and grain from Latin America, resulting in a general increase in the volume of trade between the United States and these countries.

U.S. monopoly capital continues to squeeze out Britain to consolidate its position in Latin American countries. For example, in 1950, Britain ranked first in Uruguay's foreign trade. But the following year, the United States took the first place, while Britain fell far behind. U.S. companies are also successfully squeezing out British trade with Brazil, Argentina, and other countries. In 1951, the trade volume between the United States and Brazil was four times that of Britain and Brazil.

Chichkov pointed out that the intensified entry of West German and Japanese goods into the Latin American market has made the competition between Britain and the United States in this market even more fierce.

West Germany's exports to Latin American countries have nearly increased thirteenfold in the past three years, and its total exports to these countries have, in effect, caught up with Britain. Japan is also making every effort to enter the Latin American market. In the past few years, Japan has successively signed trade agreements with Uruguay, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and other countries.

　　　　U.S. Capital Squeezes Out Britain's Position in Australia

A message in the financial column of the British "Manchester Guardian" on April 2nd shows that in the total amount of investment made by U.S. and British companies in Australia over the past 18 months, the proportion of investment by U.S. companies has greatly increased, while the proportion of investment by British companies has relatively decreased.

The message cites detailed figures of U.S. company investments in Australia since 1945. From 1945 to 1948, U.S. companies invested 19.3 million Australian pounds (hereinafter referred to as pounds) in new speculative activities and expanding existing companies. Since June 1951, these U.S. companies have invested another 50 million pounds. During the same period since June 1951, British companies invested about 60 million pounds—an amount roughly equal to the total investment of these companies in the previous six fiscal years. Most of the foreign funds are invested in the petroleum industry, especially for expanding refining equipment, with investment reaching 86 million pounds. Foreign oil companies expanding refining equipment include: Shell Oil Company, Mobil Oil Company, Texaco Oil Company, and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

　　　　West German Automobile Industry Takes Away British Overseas Business

Due to the priority given to military production and fierce competition from West Germany, British automobile production and exports fell sharply in 1952.

Last year, British automobile production was 448,000 vehicles, a decrease of 28,000 vehicles compared with 1951, and a decrease of 74,500 vehicles compared with 1950, the post-war peak. One of the main reasons for this change in production is competition. Low-priced West German automobiles are constantly seizing the overseas markets of British automobiles, resulting in a decreasing number of overseas orders received by British automobile manufacturers.

The London "Economist" magazine pointed out that West Germany is Britain's strongest competitor in automobile exports, and it is rapidly regaining its previous markets. Taking the first nine months of 1952 as an example, West Germany exported 55,700 automobiles to Western European countries, while Britain only sold 46,000 vehicles in the same market. The increasingly fierce competition has made the publication worryingly say, "What was felt in the automobile factories a few months ago was only the cool breeze of autumn competition, but now it has turned into the biting cold wind of winter."

### 帝国主义争夺市场的斗争越来越激烈  英国在拉丁美洲的贸易越来越少

    帝国主义争夺市场的斗争越来越激烈
    英国在拉丁美洲的贸易越来越少
    苏联“真理报”十三日发表维·奇奇科夫所写的题为“美英两国在拉丁美洲市场上的竞争”的文章。奇奇科夫说：英国商业界人士在英国对拉丁美洲各国的贸易前景上所表示的不安情绪，反映出他们想要抵抗美国垄断资本家在拉丁美洲各国排挤英国资本的压力。
    在战后最初几年内，拉丁美洲各国的美元贮备很快就用尽。英国利用这种情况，把拉丁美洲各国“冻结”在伦敦银行的资金解冻了，以便扩大与这些国家的贸易。到一九四九年初，英国对这些国家的出口已恢复到战前的水平。同时期，美国对这个地区的出口减少了。
    但是英国与拉丁美洲各国的兴旺的贸易是好景不长的。由于朝鲜战争和扩军运动，美国再度向拉丁美洲购买了大批原料和粮食，结果美国与这些国家的贸易额普遍地提高了。
    美国垄断资本继续排挤英国来巩固它在拉丁美洲各国的地位。例如，在一九五零年，英国在乌拉圭的对外贸易中占第一位。但是第二年，美国就占了第一位，英国却远远落在后面了。美国公司并且在成功地排挤英国与巴西、阿根廷和其他国家的贸易。在一九五一年，美国与巴西的贸易额为英国与巴西的贸易额的四倍。
    奇奇科夫指出：西德和日本货物加紧打入拉丁美洲市场，使英美在这个市场上的竞争更加激烈。
    西德在过去三年内对拉丁美洲各国的输出差不多增加了十三倍，以它对这些国家的输出总值来说，已在实际上赶上了英国。日本也在竭力打入拉丁美洲市场。在过去几年内，日本已先后与乌拉圭、墨西哥、巴西和智利等国签订了贸易协定。
        美国资本在澳大利亚排挤英国的地位
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”四月二日金融栏中的一则消息表明：在美、英公司过去十八月中在澳大利亚的投资总数中，美国公司投资的比例已大大地增加，英国公司投资的比例相对地减少。
    这个消息举出了美国公司一九四五年以来在澳大利亚投资的详细数字。从一九四五年到一九四八年，美国公司在新的投机活动和扩充现有公司方面的投资是一千九百三十万澳镑（以下简称镑）。从一九五一年六月以来的一段时期中，这些美国公司又投资了五千万镑。从一九五一年六月以来的同一时期中，英国公司投资了六千万镑左右——这个数目大约等于这些公司在以前六个会计年度中的投资总数。外国的大部分资金都投在石油工业里，特别是用于扩充炼油设备上，这方面投资达八千六百万镑。扩充炼油设备的外国石油公司有：英荷壳牌石油公司、美孚油公司、德士古石油公司和英伊石油公司。
        西德汽车工业抢了英国海外的生意
    由于实行军备生产优先制度和西德的激烈竞争，一九五二年英国汽车生产及出口均急剧下跌。
    去年英国汽车生产量为四十四万八千辆，比一九五一年减少二万八千辆，比战后最高峰的一九五零年减少七万四千五百辆。生产上这种对比情况的变化，主要原因之一是竞争。低价的西德汽车不断夺取英国汽车的海外市场，使得英国汽车商收到的海外定货日益减少。
    伦敦“经济学家”杂志指出，在汽车出口方面，西德是英国最强有力的竞争者，它正迅速地重新取得以前的市场。以一九五二年头九个月为例，西德向西欧国家出口了五万五千七百辆汽车，在这同一市场上，英国只售出四万六千辆。愈来愈剧烈的竞争使得该刊忧虑地说，“几个月以前，在汽车工厂里所感到的还仅是秋凉的竞争，现在已经变为冬季刺骨的冷风了。”    （据新华社讯）
