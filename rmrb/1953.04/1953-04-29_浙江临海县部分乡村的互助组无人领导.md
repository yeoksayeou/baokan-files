    Mutual Aid Teams in Some Villages of Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, Lack Leadership
    A letter from correspondents Shao Ziqiang, Shao Shenggou, and Zhang Chongxing: We are members of the Taizhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhejiang Province's inspection team. Recently, we inspected spring plowing preparation work in the Tutao District of Linhai County and discovered that the local leading organs were not providing leadership to the mutual aid movement in the two townships of Qian'an and Songnan, which affected spring plowing production.
    During the busy summer and autumn farming seasons last year, these two townships organized many mutual aid teams. Songnan Township had 76 teams, with 420 households participating, accounting for 48.5% of the township's total households. After the teams were organized, the local leading cadres did not provide specific leadership to these teams. Among the 39 mutual aid teams in the second, fifth, and sixth villages of the township, 16 teams had organizational problems due to unresolved issues such as unclear work point calculations, contradictions in the order of production, and a lack of key personnel within the teams. In Qian'an Township, the comrades working there did not even know how many households were currently participating in mutual aid teams. According to our understanding, there are currently 19 mutual aid teams, including 102 households, organized for the purpose of jointly cultivating rice paddies. However, because there is no one to lead them, 13 teams with 74 households have not implemented work point calculations, which affects the consolidation of the mutual aid teams.
    In addition, the agricultural tools of the members of the mutual aid teams organized in Qian'an Township last year were all used by the teams for free. The local leading organs have not yet paid attention to this phenomenon of infringing on private interests and hindering the enthusiasm of individual farmers for production.
    The above problems have affected spring plowing production. We hope that the local leading organs will quickly resolve them.

    浙江临海县部分乡村的互助组无人领导
    通讯员邵自强、邵胜欧、张崇行来信：我们是中共浙江省台州地委巡视组的人员，最近到临海县涂桃区检查春耕准备工作，发现当地领导机关对前岸、松南两乡的互助运动不加领导，影响了春耕生产。
    这两个乡在去年夏、秋农忙季节中，组织了许多互助组。松南乡有七十六个组，参加的农户四百二十户，占全乡总户口百分之四十八点五。组织起来以后，当地领导干部对这些组就没有进行过具体领导。该乡二、五、六等三个村的三十九个互助组中，已有十六个组因为记工算账不清、生产先后矛盾、组内缺乏骨干等问题没有得到解决，组织涣散。在前岸乡的工作同志连该乡目前有几户参加互助组都不知道。据我们了解，全乡目前因为共同做秧田而组织起来的互助组就有十九个组，包括一百零二户。但因为没有人领导，其中就有十三组七十四户没有实行记工算账，影响了互助组的巩固。
    此外，前岸乡去年组织的互助组，组员的农具全部由组白用。当地领导机关对这种侵犯私人利益、妨碍个体农民生产积极性的现象，至今也没有加以重视。
    以上问题已经影响了春耕生产，希望当地领导机关赶快加以解决。
