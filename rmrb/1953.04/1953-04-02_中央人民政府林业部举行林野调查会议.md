    The Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government Holds Forest Resources Survey Conference
    To support national industrialization and strengthen forestry construction, the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government held its first National Forest Resources Survey Conference from March 16th to 22nd. Under the general forestry policy of universal forest protection, rational felling, development of new forest areas, and vigorous planned afforestation, the conference determined that forest resources survey work must be coordinated with the development and practical needs of the forest industry, carrying out forest management surveys step by step and continuing to complete forest resources surveys. In felling areas and areas closed off for forest cultivation, forest regeneration surveys should be conducted. In key, large-scale afforestation areas, such as farmland protection forests, sand control forests, water conservation forests, and coastal forests, detailed soil and plant surveys should be conducted in coordination with relevant departments, and design work should be done well.
    The conference believes that due to the largely blind nature of past forest resources survey work in various regions and insufficient manpower, the situation of China's existing forest resources has not yet been fully understood. At the same time, many local survey projects do not pay attention to design; some cannot be coordinated with afforestation and felling work; or the survey purpose is not clear, resulting in a waste of manpower and resources. In order for the development of forestry to meet the needs of national construction, future forest resources survey work must be purposeful and focused on solving major problems, avoiding overreach and focusing on quantity over quality; it is necessary to overcome carelessness, the pursuit of numbers, and the tendency to conduct surveys without design. In this way, afforestation plans, felling plans, and tending and regeneration plans can be better completed, so that forestry work can embark on the road of rational management.
    Finally, the conference put forward the tasks for forest resources survey work in 1953: the survey team of the Central Ministry of Forestry will conduct forest management surveys in the primitive forest area of Northeast China and assist the Northwest Region in conducting water conservation forest surveys in the Yellow River basin. The survey teams of major administrative regions and provinces should conduct focused, planned, and purposeful forest resources surveys of larger areas in major state-owned forest areas, major water systems, and coastal areas; and conduct general surveys in remote primitive forest areas. Private forests in various provinces will not be subject to forest management surveys, and forest resources surveys or general surveys should be conducted based on forestry policies and local conditions. In ethnic minority areas, surveys should be conducted in accordance with ethnic minority policies, with the consent of the local people's government and with their assistance. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央人民政府林业部举行林野调查会议
    为支援国家工业化，加强林业建设工作，中央人民政府林业部在三月十六日到二十二日召开了第一次全国林野调查会议。在普遍护林、合理采伐、开发新林区、有计划地大力造林的林业总方针下，会议确定了林野调查工作，必须做到配合森林工业的发展和实际需要，有步骤地开展森林经理调查，继续完成森林资源调查。在采伐迹地和封山育林等地区，进行森林更新调查。在重点的、大面积的造林地区，如农田防护林，防砂林，水源林，海岸林等，应配合有关部门，进行详细的土壤和植物调查，并做好设计工作。
    会议认为，由于过去各地林野调查工作盲目性较大，力量不足，因此，对我国现有森林资源的情况，至今尚未全面了解。同时，好多地方的调查工作，都不重视设计；有的地方不能和造林采伐工作配合起来；或者调查目的不明确，形成人力物力的浪费。为了使林业的发展能适应国家建设的需要，今后的林野调查工作，必须做到有目的、有重点地集中力量解决主要问题，不可贪多冒进，重量不重质；要克服粗枝大叶，追求数字，有调查没有设计等偏向。这样，才能更好地完成造林计划、采伐计划、抚育更新计划，使林业工作走上合理经营的道路。
    最后，会议提出一九五三年林野调查工作的任务：中央林业部调查队进行东北原始林区的森林经理调查，协助西北区进行黄河流域的水源林调查。各大行政区和各省的调查队在主要国有林区、主要水系和沿海海岸地区，进行有重点的、有计划的、有目的的较大面积的林野调查工作；在边远原始森林地区，进行概况了解。各省私有林不作森林经理调查，应根据林业政策和当地具体情况，作森林资源调查或概况了解。在少数民族地区，应根据少数民族政策，通过当地人民政府，取得其同意并在其帮助下，进行调查工作。（新华社）
