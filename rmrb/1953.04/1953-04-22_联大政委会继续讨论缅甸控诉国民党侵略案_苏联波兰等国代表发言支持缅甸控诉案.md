Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 21st: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee continued its discussion on April 20th of Burma's complaint against Kuomintang aggression.

    In the morning session, the first to speak was Yemen's representative, Jamandi. He said that the Burmese representative had presented irrefutable evidence proving that the Burmese government's complaint was entirely justified. The Yemen representative, while emphasizing that this case was a "blatant aggression," warned that if the accused were not condemned and stopped, it would create a precedent that would threaten international peace. Jamandi expressed dissatisfaction that this act of aggression had been allowed to continue for three years without high-level authorities intervening to stop it. He said that this case was a provocation to the United Nations, and if the United Nations could not accept this challenge, it would seriously undermine the trust of small and weak countries in the United Nations' ability to protect them. Jamandi concluded by saying that he would vote in favor of the Burmese government's proposal. This proposal recommends that the Security Council should condemn the Kuomintang bandit gang's aggression and take all necessary steps to ensure that this act of aggression is stopped immediately.

    After his speech, Soviet representative Zarubin said that Burma's complaint should receive the most serious attention from the General Assembly. The appearance of armed bandits on Burmese territory, committing crimes of aggression against the Burmese government and the People's Republic of China, endangers peace and security in Asia. The Soviet representative pointed out that, as evidenced by the documents presented by the Burmese representative, these looting bandits are directed and supplied by the Taiwan clique. The Soviet representative concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation would vote in favor of the Burmese government's proposal.

    The next to speak was the New Zealand representative. He acknowledged that the presence of Kuomintang armed bandits on Burmese territory was illegal, but he suggested that a solution should be sought through "American mediation."

    Indonesian representative Bala said that aggression against Burma was not only a fact that had already occurred, but it was also continuing. The United Nations should condemn this act of aggression and take action to restore peace and stability.

    The Thai representative suggested that the United Nations should establish a body to resolve the "Burmese dispute."

    Polish representative Winiewicz said that the documents presented to the committee showed that Burma was being systematically ravaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The actions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have caused great suffering to the Burmese people and threaten peace in Southeast Asia. Winiewicz said that the Polish delegation would therefore vote in favor of the Burmese proposal.

    The next to speak was the Kuomintang's Jiang Tingfu. He denied any connection between Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang army in Burma.

    At the afternoon meeting, the Israeli representative announced unconditional support for Burma's complaint.

    The next to speak was British representative Jebb. Jebb acknowledged the fact that Burma had been subjected to aggression, but expressed doubt as to whether it could be proven that the Chiang Kai-shek government was responsible. Jebb said that this intolerable situation created for the Burmese government could be resolved by withdrawing the Chiang Kai-shek troops or by making them agree to be detained.

    As no one was willing to speak, the Political Committee adjourned until April 21st.

    联大政委会继续讨论缅甸控诉国民党侵略案
    苏联波兰等国代表发言支持缅甸控诉案
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：联合国大会政治委员会四月二十日继续讨论缅甸控诉国民党侵略案。
    在上午会议上，第一个发言的是也门代表疆曼蒂。他说，缅甸代表提出了不可辩驳的证据，证明缅甸政府的控诉是完全有理由的。也门代表在着重指出这个案件是“露骨的侵略”时警告说，如果被控者不予谴责和制止，就会造成一个将会威胁国际和平的先例。疆曼蒂很不满地指出：这个侵略行为竟被容许继续达三年之久而高级权力机关竟不出面干预予以制止。他说，这个案件是向联合国提出的挑衅，如果联合国不能接受这个挑衅，就会严重地削弱弱小国家对联合国保护它们的能力的信任。疆曼蒂最后说，他将投票赞成缅甸政府的提案。这个提案建议安全理事会应谴责国民党匪帮的侵略，并应采取一切必要步骤，保证这个侵略行为立即停止。
    在他发言之后，苏联代表查鲁宾说，缅甸控诉案应该受到大会最严重的注意。在缅甸领土上出现武装匪徒，犯着侵略缅甸政府和中华人民共和国的罪行，这就危害了亚洲的和平和安全。苏联代表指出，正如缅甸代表提出的文件所证明的，这些进行劫掠的匪徒是由台湾集团所指挥和供给的。苏联代表最后说，苏联代表团将投票赞成缅甸政府的提案。
    接着发言的是新西兰代表。他承认国民党武装匪帮出现在缅甸领土上是非法的，不过，他建议应该经由“美国斡旋”以求得解决。
    印度尼西亚代表巴拉说，侵略缅甸不仅是已经发生的事实，而且还在继续着。联合国应该谴责这个侵略行为，并应有所行动，使和平与安定得以恢复。
    泰国代表建议说，联合国应成立一个解决“缅甸纠纷”的机构。
    波兰代表温尼维奇说，委员会上所提出的文件说明缅甸受到蒋介石匪帮的有计划的蹂躏。蒋介石匪帮的行动使缅甸人民遭受很大痛苦，并威胁着东南亚的和平。温尼维奇说，所以，波兰代表团将投票赞成缅甸的提案。
    接着讲话的是国民党的蒋廷黻。他否认蒋介石和在缅甸的国民党军队之间有联系。
    在下午会议上，以色列代表宣布无条件支持缅甸的控诉。
    接着发言的是英国代表杰伯。杰伯承认缅甸遭受侵略的事实，但是对于能否证实蒋介石政府应当负责一点，表示怀疑。杰伯说，这种对缅甸政府造成的不可容忍的情势，可以用撤退蒋介石军队或者使他们同意被拘禁的办法予以解决。
    由于没有人愿意发言，政治委员会休会至四月二十一日再开。
