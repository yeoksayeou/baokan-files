Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, has corrected the coercive commandism of county and district cadres, and many villages have shown a new atmosphere in spring plowing and production. In 1952, the Chaoyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government, without investigation and research, assigned the task of planting 350,000 mu of cotton throughout the county. Comrade Bai Li, the county head, publicly said to the district cadres: "We must complete the cotton planting task with the spirit of the 'Three Antis'; failure to complete it will result in dismissal, investigation, and prosecution in court." Under the orders of their superiors, district and village cadres forcibly assigned cotton planting quotas based on the amount of land farmers owned. The farmers were extremely dissatisfied with this and responded by reporting less planting than they actually did, or reporting smaller plots as larger ones. Some farmers planted other crops on land unsuitable for cotton planting, but County Head Bai Li forced them to replant with cotton. According to statistics from nine districts, more than 1,760 mu of large fields were forcibly replanted with cotton. The seventh and eighth districts of Chaoyang County were the two districts with the most cotton planting in Chaoyang County, and also the two districts with the most severe coercive commandism. Last year, Huanghuatan Village planted 2,313 mu of cotton, of which more than 500 mu were planted on sandy land and hillsides that were fundamentally unsuitable for cotton. Zhou Deyuan, the cotton planting officer working in the village at the time, in order to "complete the cotton planting task on schedule," even forced the masses to plant cotton all night with lanterns. In addition, cadres also forced the masses to pull up sesame seedlings that were intercropped in the fields and forced them to apply cotton pesticides. The eighth district chief organized a red spider extermination team and forced the Ulanhe Shuo Village to spray cotton pesticides, forcing the masses to pretend to spray. Some farmers applied three applications of fake pesticide, and not a single bug was killed. The coercive commandism of selling fertilizer was also widespread. Last year, Huanghuatan Village's more than 40,000 jin of fertilizer was distributed according to 17.6 jin per mu of cotton land, and no one could refuse it. The county cooperative even regarded this assigned method as a successful "experience" and promoted it throughout the county. The actual cotton planting area in the county was 250,000 mu, but district and village cadres fabricated reports to cope with their superiors, and the numbers added up to 330,000 mu. The County People's Government immediately reported this false number to the Provincial People's Government, and later, based on this false number, assigned the task of purchasing 35.35 million jin of cotton. In reality, after purchasing 24.948 million jin of cotton, the masses had no cotton left in their hands. The county committee and county government then issued a joint instruction, using a coercive tone to instruct lower-level cadres to forcibly purchase cotton. Zhang Xuguang, the secretary of the county committee, also said at a meeting: "Whoever does not complete the task will be dismissed, investigated, and prosecuted! If anyone is seen selling cotton at the market, the cotton will be confiscated, and the person will be sent to court." As a result, village cadres restricted the masses from spinning and weaving at home, even smashing the farmers' spinning wheels and rummaging through their chests, leaving the cotton farmers unable to wear cotton clothes in winter. Some tearfully went to other places to buy cotton to make cotton clothes for their children. The result of coercive commandism severely damaged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, caused incalculable economic losses to the masses, made the masses complain, and alienated the Party and the government from the people.

This year, in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline, Comrade Bai Li, the former county head of Chaoyang County, and Comrade Zhang Xuguang, the secretary of the CCP County Committee, made public self-criticisms to the masses. County and district cadres reversed their coercive commandism style, and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses has generally risen again. Last year, Huanghuatan Village planted a total of 2,313 mu of cotton, with an average yield of only 150 jin of seed cotton per mu. This year, the masses voluntarily planted 1,174 mu of cotton, striving for an average yield of 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. Not only will the yield per unit be doubled compared to last year, but the total output will also be greater than last year. The masses are full of confidence in increasing production. They said that this year's increased production has four favorable conditions: First, the attitude of the district leaders is better, they are not coercive, and everyone is more energetic in production. Second, land that is not suitable for cotton planting will not be planted this year, and the cotton fields are smaller, so they can be managed better. Third, fertilizer has increased compared to the past. Fourth, after technical training, new methods have been learned, which has increased confidence in increasing production.

An old man in Huanghuatan Village made a very appropriate summary of the current situation. He said, "When we planted cotton last year, we all had long faces; this year, we are all smiling. Just watch, the happiest time is yet to come!" (Lu Fengyi, Shao Xianshen, Yan Zhenhua, Liu Xizhou)

This year, the Yanbei Special District of Shanxi Province plans to sow 500,000 mu of wheat. As of April 10, according to statistics from 1,062 villages (approximately 70 percent of all villages), 240,000 mu have been sown. Some of it has been planted relatively well. However, because the area planned for wheat planting in the special district this year is 70 percent more than last year, and some farmers are not accustomed to planting more wheat, some places have experienced the phenomenon of coercive commandism and the hard distribution of tasks. In Lingqiu, some villages distributed the task of planting one mu of wheat for every ten mu of land, regardless of whether it was irrigated or dry land. Last year, Shijia Village in the second district of Shuo County only planted 120 mu of wheat, but this year it was assigned 1,300 mu (most of the land in this village is sandy and has not been tested). Some areas assigned tasks by household and by mu, causing concerns and dissatisfaction among the masses. Some people are afraid that they will not be able to harvest it, and some are afraid that it will increase the burden. For example, in Zhaoshiba Village in the first district of Shuo County, the masses were afraid of paying more public grain, so they dared not report the actual number of mu planted, reporting three mu for every five mu planted. In some areas, the masses were forced by cadres to the point where they had no choice but to adopt a "handing in the homework" attitude, planting wheat in poor land. They said: Whether it grows or not is up to it; anyway, I have completed the task. It is good that Yanbei Special District pays attention to increasing grain production, but this method of formulating agricultural production plans that are not realistic and distributing sowing numbers directly to each village and household is wrong and should be corrected quickly.

    热河朝阳纠正植棉工作中的强迫命令作风
    山西雁北专区应该迅速纠正强迫群众种麦的现象
    热河省朝阳县纠正了县区干部的强迫命令作风以后，许多村庄在春耕生产中已经出现了新的气象。中共朝阳县委和县人民政府在一九五二年，不经调查研究，布置了全县植棉三十五万亩的任务。县长柏里同志曾公开向区干部说：“要以‘三反’的劲头来完成植棉任务，完不成要撤职查办送法院。”区村干部在上级的命令下，就按农民的土地多少，强迫规定植棉数字。农民对这极为不满，便以种少报多、种小亩报大亩的办法来应付。有些农民把不适宜植棉的土地种上了别的庄稼，县长柏里又强迫他们翻种成棉田。据九个区统计，有一千七百六十多亩大田被强迫翻种了棉花。朝阳县七、八两区是朝阳县种棉花较多的两个区，也是强迫命令比较严重的两个区。去年黄花滩村种了二千三百一十三亩棉花，就有五百亩以上种在根本不能种棉的沙地和山坡上。当时在该村工作的植棉员周德元为了“按期完成植棉任务”，竟强迫群众打着灯笼种了一夜棉花。此外，干部还强迫群众拔田里带种的芝麻，强迫群众打棉药。八区区长组织消灭红蜘蛛队，强迫给乌兰河硕村撒棉药，逼得群众假装撒药。有的农民打了三遍药都是假的，一个虫子也未打死。推销肥田粉的强迫命令也是普遍的，黄花滩村去年的四万多斤肥田粉是按每亩棉田十七斤六两摊派下去的，谁家不要也不行。县合作总社还把这个摊派的办法当做成功的“经验”，在全县加以推广。全县实种棉花二十五万亩，区村干部为应付上级而造假报告，数字加起来是三十三万亩。县人民政府立即把这个假数字报告给省人民政府，后来并根据这假数字布置了购棉三千五百三十五万斤的任务；实际上，购棉二千四百九十四万八千斤以后，群众手中已没有存棉。县委、县府就又发出联合指示，以强制的口吻指示下级干部强迫购棉。县委书记张旭光并在一次会议上说：“谁不完成任务就撤职查办！看见有人上集卖棉，棉花一律没收，人送法院。”于是，村干部就限制群众土纺土织，甚至砸碎农民的纺花车，翻箱倒柜，弄得种棉花的农民冬天穿不上棉衣；有的含着泪去外地购棉，给自己的孩子们做棉衣服。强迫命令的结果，严重地损害了广大群众的生产积极性，造成了群众在经济上不可估量的损失，使群众怨声载道，使党和政府脱离了人民群众。
    今年在反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争中，朝阳县原县长柏里和中共县委书记张旭光二同志向群众作了公开检讨，县区干部扭转了强迫命令作风，广大群众的生产情绪又普遍高涨起来。黄花滩村去年共种了二千三百一十三亩棉花，平均每亩只收了一百五十斤籽棉；今年群众自愿种棉一千一百七十四亩，争取平均每亩产三百斤籽棉，不但单位产量要比去年提高一倍，而且，总产量还要比去年多。群众对于提高产量满有信心。他们说今年增产有四个有利条件：第一，区领导干部态度好了，不强迫了，大家生产就有劲了。第二，不能种棉花的地今年不种了，棉田少了，可以管理得好。第三，肥料比过去增加了。第四，经过了技术训练，学了新办法，增加了增产的信心。
    黄花滩村一个老大爷对目前情况做了一个很恰当的总结，他说：“去年种棉花的时候，我们都哭丧着脸；今年都喜笑颜开。瞧着吧，高兴的时候还在后头哪！”（鲁凤仪、邵显身、阎振华、刘西舟）
    山西省雁北专区今年计划播种小麦五十万亩；到四月十日，据一千零六十二个村（约占全部村数的百分之七十）统计，已播种二十四万亩。其中一部分是种得较好的。但由于今年专区计划种麦的面积比去年多了百分之七十，而有些农民还不习惯多种麦子，有些地方就发生了强迫命令硬分配任务的现象。灵邱有的村不论水旱地都按十亩地种一亩小麦摊派下去。朔县二区石家村去年只种小麦一百二十亩，今年分配了一千三百亩（这个村的大部分地是沙地，还没有试用）。某些地区按户、按亩分配任务，引起了群众的顾虑和不满。有人怕收不了，有人怕增加负担。如朔县一区照什八庄群众因为怕多征公粮，种了小麦不敢实报亩数，种五亩报三亩。还有些地区群众被干部逼得没法子，就采取“交差”的态度，把小麦种在不好的地里。他们说：长不长在它，反正我是完成任务了。雁北专区注意粮食增产是好的，但这种不切实际地制订农业生产计划，而且把播种数字一直分配到各村各户的办法是错误的，应当赶快纠正。    （宋之洙）
