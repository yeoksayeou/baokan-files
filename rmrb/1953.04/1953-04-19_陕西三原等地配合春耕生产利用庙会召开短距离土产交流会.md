In some areas of Shaanxi, due to poor summer and autumn harvests last year, the spring famine is quite serious, and farmers are experiencing difficulties with both living and production materials. In order to solve the difficulties of farmers in their lives and production, San Yuan, Changwu, Chaoyi, Yongshou, Huanglong, and other places have successively held seven short-distance native product exchange meetings from mid-January to the end of March this year, utilizing temple fairs, and achieved good results. The majority of participants in the exchange meetings were farmers, and representatives from Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Xi'an City, and other places also participated.

The total transaction value of these seven exchange meetings reached 12.8 billion yuan, of which the transaction volume of local and special products accounted for 38.85 percent, the transaction volume of draft animals accounted for 28.25 percent of the total, and the transaction volume of general merchandise, cotton cloth, etc., accounted for 32.9 percent. More than 57,600 pieces of various farm tools were traded, more than 2,490 head of livestock were traded, and more than 1.85 million jin of grain were traded. In terms of business proportion, the total purchase and sale value of state-owned trade and cooperatives accounted for 16.12 percent of the total transaction value, and the total purchase and sale value of private industrial and commercial enterprises and rural small handicraftsmen accounted for 83.88 percent of the total. Through these exchange meetings, not only was the primary market enlivened, and sales channels were found for a wide variety of small and slow-selling local and special products, but also the spring plowing production of farmers was strongly supported.

The role of native product exchanges in spring plowing production can be seen from the transaction situation of these exchange meetings. At the trading venues, the most popular items with farmers were farm tools and living materials related to production, which sold well and quickly. The Jingchuan Iron Factory transported 3,000 iron plowshares to the Changwu County exchange meeting, and they were all sold out in less than two days. All 2,495 pieces of farm tools at the Wulizhen exchange meeting in Yijun County were sold. With the active promotion of state-owned trading companies, these exchange meetings conducted a large number of purchases of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products produced by farmers. At the San Yuan County exchange meeting, all 21,500 jin of miscellaneous grains and 360,000 jin of cotton sold by farmers at the meeting were purchased. Zhao Bingtang, from the Sixth District of Chaoyi, sold sideline products and earned 220,000 yuan, happily saying: "The People's Government is really good. They care about our spring plowing production, not only providing us with the farm tools and grain we need, but also purchasing our sideline products. Therefore, we must do a better job in production to be worthy of the People's Government."

The transaction volume of state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private industrial and commercial enterprises also increased significantly compared to usual.

    陕西三原等地配合春耕生产利用庙会召开短距离土产交流会
    陕西部分地区因为去年夏秋歉收，春荒相当严重，农民生活资料与生产资料都发生了困难。三原、长武、朝邑、永寿、黄龙等地为了解决农民生活与生产上的困难，从今年一月中旬至三月底，先后利用庙会召开了七次短距离土产交流会，获得良好结果。参加交流会的人以农民为最多，河南、山东、山西、西安市等地，都派有代表参加。
    这七个交流会，成交总值达一百二十八亿元，其中土、特产品交易额占百分之三十八点八五，耕畜交易额占总百分之二十八点二五，百货、花纱布等交易额占百分之三十二点九。各种农具成交五万七千六百多件，牲畜成交二千四百九十多头，粮食成交一百八十五万多斤。以经营比重来分，国营贸易、合作社购销总值占总成交额百分之十六点一二，私营工商业及农村小手工业者购销总值占总成交百分之八十三点八八。通过这些交流会，不但活跃了初级市场，为种类繁多的小宗滞销土、特产寻找了销路，而且有力地支持了农民的春耕生产。
    从这些交流会的交易情况可以看出土产交流对春耕生产所起的作用。在交易场所，最受农民欢迎的是有关生产的农具及生活资料，它们销得多，销得快。泾川铁厂运到长武县交流会上三千页铁铧，不到两天的时间就全部销完。宜君县五里镇交流会上的农具二千四百九十五件，全部成交。这些交流会对农民出产的农、副、土、特产品，在国营贸易公司积极推动下，进行了大量的收购。三原县交流会上全部收购了农民运到大会上出售的杂粮二万一千五百斤、棉花三十六万斤。朝邑六区赵丙堂卖出副业产品，得价二十二万元，高兴地说：“人民政府真好，关心我们的春耕生产，不但供给我们需要的农具与粮食，而且收购我们的副业产品。所以我们更要把生产搞好，才对得住人民政府。”
    国营贸易公司、合作社、私营工商业交易额也比平时显著增加。
