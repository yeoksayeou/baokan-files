Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Lyushar Tseten Taba, head of the Tibetan Delegation, expressed his observations to our reporter on the eve of his departure from Beijing to return to Tibet. He said: Please convey our deep gratitude to those friends who welcomed and entertained us. We will never forget their deep friendship. We will bring this friendship back to Tibet and tell all the Tibetan people.

Lyushar said: During the six months we lived in the motherland, we personally experienced the spirit of great unity among the people of the whole country. I saw with my own eyes that people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life were united in resisting America and aiding Korea, and united in construction. He said: As a song sings, "Unity is strength." The people of all ethnic groups in the country are closely united and can defeat any imperialist aggression.

Lyushar said: I am very envious of the happy life of the people in the motherland. I have met many workers and seen the lives of ordinary people; their food and clothing are very good. In a complex city like Shanghai, I have never seen a prostitute soliciting or anything being stolen. He said: The Tibetan people must also gradually strive to improve their living standards, so they urgently need assistance from the advanced regions of the motherland in terms of manpower and material resources. We hope to quickly build the Kangzang Highway to Lhasa and connect Tibet with the mainland.

Regarding the fact that freedom of religious belief is guaranteed everywhere, this fifty-year-old lama representative expressed particular emotion. He said: I have been to many temples to burn incense and worship Buddha. I used my own actions to expose the rumor that "the Communist Party destroys religion."

Lyushar said: The current task of the Tibetan people is to resolutely implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, and with the direct assistance of the Tibet Military Region troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to build a new Tibet. The new Tibet is part of our powerful motherland.

Lyushar finally said: This time in Beijing, Chairman Mao gave us important instructions on the construction of Tibet. We know that only the road indicated by Chairman Mao is the only correct road. We must use various methods to widely convey Chairman Mao's instructions and the gains of this visit to the Tibetan people and unite all the Tibetan people under the banner of Mao Zedong to advance.

    西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴
    离京返藏前发表在祖国内地参观的观感
   【新华社八日讯】西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴在离京返藏前夕，对本社记者发表观感。他说：请你代我们向那些欢迎并招待我们的朋友们致深深的谢意。我们永不会忘记他们的深情厚谊。我们将把这种情谊带回西藏去，告诉所有的西藏人民。
    柳霞说：我们在祖国内地生活的半年期间，亲身体会了全国人民大团结的精神。我亲眼看见全国各族各界人民一致团结抗美援朝，又一致团结从事建设。他说：正如一只歌曲所歌颂的：“团结就是力量”，全国各族人民紧密团结，可以战胜任何帝国主义的侵略。
    柳霞说：我非常羡慕祖国内地人民的幸福生活。我接触了许多工人，也看到了一般人民的生活，他们的吃穿都很好。在上海那样复杂的大城市里，我没有看见过一次妓女拉人和东西被扒的事情。他说：我们西藏人民也要逐步争取提高生活水平，所以迫切要求祖国先进地区在人力物力上的帮助。我们希望能迅速地把康藏公路修到拉萨，把西藏与内地联系起来。
    对于各地宗教信仰自由得到保障的事实，这位五十岁的喇嘛代表特别表示感动。他说：我到过许多寺院去烧香敬佛，我用自己的行动揭穿了“共产党破坏宗教”的谣言。
    柳霞说：西藏人民目前的任务是，在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，在中国人民解放军西藏军区部队的直接援助下，坚决执行和平解放西藏办法的协议，建设新的西藏。新的西藏是我们强大祖国的一部分。
    柳霞最后说：这次在北京，毛主席当面给我们作了建设西藏的重要指示，我们知道只有毛主席所指示的道路才是唯一正确的道路。我们一定把毛主席的指示和这次参观的收获，用各种方法广泛地传达到西藏人民中去，把全西藏人民团结在毛泽东的旗帜下前进。
