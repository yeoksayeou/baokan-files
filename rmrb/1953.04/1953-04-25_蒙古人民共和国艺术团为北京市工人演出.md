Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: The music, dance, and acrobatics performance by the Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, was held at the Labor Theater of the Beijing Workers' Cultural Palace tonight to entertain Beijing workers. More than 4,000 people attended.

This was the art troupe's first performance for the general public in the capital. The workers of Beijing deeply love the art of the working people of fraternal countries. The audience's full attention was captivated by the art troupe's performance. At the end of each wonderful program, the audience responded with prolonged applause, repeatedly inviting the performers to perform again.

In tonight's art troupe performance, meritorious actors Damdinsuren and others skillfully flipped back and forth on steel frames in the air, performing the stunt of aerial trapeze, winning repeated applause from the audience, and performed it again. The art troupe's choir, under the direction of Choibalsang Prize winner and meritorious composer B. Damdinsuren, used magnificent songs to praise Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Choibalsan, overflowing with patriotism and internationalism. The solo of famous female singer, Choibalsang Prize winner, winner of the international competition at the 1949 Budapest World Youth and Student Festival, and National Meritorious Actor of the Mongolian People's Republic, Chogzhilmaa, was most loved by the audience. Not only did her melodious voice grab people from the start, but she also sang the Chinese song "People of the World Unite Tightly" in accurate Chinese. The audience applauded and cheered repeatedly, asking her to sing two more Chinese songs such as "Singing of Chairman Mao." Female meritorious actor Erdenetsogt performed "Hunter and Flying Bird," and her light and graceful dance won repeated praise from the audience. After four curtain calls, she had to perform it again. Meritorious actor Jimiyang's matouqin solo "Beautiful Melody" and meritorious actor Chuluun's violin solo "Khentii Mountains Song" both demonstrated the achievements of Mongolian artists in learning Soviet art and improving national musical art. The female singer Zhadgdasreng's solo "Zebra" folk song, the dance troupe's performances of "Eren Tseg Dance," "Dörbet Folk Dance," and "Mongolian Dance" and other programs all showed the new style of Mongolian national art that has been transformed and improved, and the diligence, bravery, and joyous emotions of the Mongolian people. The fitness performance by meritorious actors Zh. Damdinsuren, Nachuk, and actors Nymadash, Dorji; the "Ladder Climbing" performance by meritorious actor Nachuk and actors Tserendolima, T. Shemdaayush, Jigmiddorj; the soft dance performance by actress Majigsuren, and the wonderful acrobatic performances such as "Headstand on Ladder" fully demonstrated the superb skills of the Mongolian people. The excerpt from the opera "Road to Happiness" performed at the end further reflected the great achievements of Mongolian artists in learning Soviet art.

All these programs were deeply appreciated by the workers of Beijing.
