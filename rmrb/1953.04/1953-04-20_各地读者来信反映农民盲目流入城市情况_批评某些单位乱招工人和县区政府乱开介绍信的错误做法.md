Letters from Readers Across the Country Reflect the Situation of Peasants Blindly Flowing into Cities
Criticizing Certain Units' Erroneous Practices of Randomly Recruiting Workers and County and District Governments Issuing Recommendation Letters

    Our newspaper has received many letters from readers reflecting the serious situation of peasants blindly flowing into cities across the country, criticizing and offering suggestions regarding units that arbitrarily recruit new workers from rural areas and county and district governments that arbitrarily introduce peasants to cities to find employment. We now publish excerpts from some of the letters below:

    Jiangsu readers Ding Yugen, Zhu Jinhai, and Ju Bingzhang write: Zhang Renju, a comrade from the Construction Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, whose ancestral home is Jiepai Township, Xinqiao District, Danyang, Jiangsu. After returning home on February 23rd, he convened a meeting of peasants and said at the meeting: "Now the Construction Engineering Company is recruiting a batch of workers, with a quota of 100 people. Whoever goes in can get a salary of 600,000 yuan per month." Some peasants then asked Zhang Renju, "The journey is far, is there definitely work to do there?" Zhang Renju patted his chest and said, "Does the People's Government still deceive people now? I can guarantee it. As for travel expenses, you can find a way temporarily. You can send money back home one month after arriving in Beijing." At that time, it was the height of water conservancy construction, and all the labor force in the township was concentrated on opening rivers. Upon hearing this news, more than 100 peasants eagerly signed up. Then they went to the district government to open emigration certificates (after more than 60 certificates had been issued, the district government realized that this was inappropriate and immediately stopped issuing emigration certificates, but did not dissuade the peasants who had already received emigration certificates). To solve the problem of travel expenses, some borrowed from relatives and friends, some sold their spring rations, and some even sold their land. However, when they arrived at their destination, there was no work to do. The people from the engineering company told them, "Now the weather is cold, and construction cannot start. People are only needed when construction starts. Now you can go back. We will notify you once people are needed. As for travel expenses, the company can temporarily pay in advance, and you can repay it later." Thus, each person was given about 200,000 yuan for travel and food expenses, and in this way, more than 60 people returned. We believe this practice is very wrong, and we suggest that relevant departments and personnel conduct a thorough review and seriously handle this issue.

    A letter from the Jinzhou City First District People's Government, Liaoxi Province: Qi Rulai and nine others from Qizhuang, Dabu Township, Sixth District, Yanggu County, Shandong Province, registered their residence at 37 Xi'an Street in our district on March 16th with their migration certificates. They also had a letter from the township people's government, which stated in essence: these ten people are brick workers, and are leaving to engage in production due to livelihood difficulties; this is to certify. After they arrived in Jinzhou, four went to Shenyang and two went to Anshan, leaving four in Jinzhou. When we mobilized them to return to their hometown, Qi Rulai said, "We were approved to leave by the Sixth District People's Government and the Yanggu County People's Government." Qi Xieyong said, "When we came, the county told us: if you can't find work there, write to the county government, and we will contact higher levels for you." He also said, "We have a division of labor within our mutual aid group. Seven laborers stay at home to farm. The ten of us, led by Qi Rulai, are going out to engage in production, planning to bring back 3 million yuan by the lunar March to dig a well and buy two cows for the group. We all made challenge plans when we came, and we will all return home at the end of the year." They also said, "To solve livelihood difficulties, the county allows the people of our Third and Sixth Districts to migrate freely to other counties and cities." However, after arriving in Jinzhou, because they could not find employment, they faced livelihood difficulties, expressed dissatisfaction with the government, and even went to the district government every day to demand a solution to their problems. This has increased the difficulty of our labor employment work and created a negative impact among the masses. We believe that Yanggu County's practice of allowing peasants to blindly flow to other places is wrong, and it is an irresponsible attitude towards the people. It is suggested that the county quickly deal with this issue and check the work of the relevant personnel.

    Guangxi reader Yan Jing writes: The Guangxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau published an advertisement in the Guangxi Daily last year recruiting temporary workers for water conservancy projects. This February, twenty or so peasants from Shuanghe Township, Third District, Xing'an County, still inquired about the salary from the bureau, wanting to apply. In addition, some militiamen also wanted to go to the mines to work. For example, Wang Zhihao, a militiaman from Chetou Township, Second District, Guanyang, wanted to ask for leave to go to the mines. The militia captain called him to a meeting, and he said, "I am not a militiaman anymore." Another militiaman, Wang Huayuan, returned from the mines and did not attend study sessions or meetings at the militia team. When the militia team criticized him, he said, "I don't want the militia to manage me, nor do I want the township government and the peasant association to manage me. I am managed by the workers." Such situations exist in various districts of the county. This is all caused by certain units arbitrarily recruiting people from rural areas and district and township governments arbitrarily introducing people. For example, a certain unit recruited young peasants to work in Shanglin County with very lenient conditions, but the quota was very small, which caused many peasants to be uneasy about agricultural production. There are also some places where insufficient care is given to demobilized producers returning to their hometowns, so they still want to return to the city. For example, Lei Zhenshan, a carpenter from the Tenth District of Heng County, returned to his hometown last year, but because he returned late, he did not receive land and faced livelihood difficulties. He had no choice but to ask the district government to allow him to return to Nanning to resume work, and the district government immediately issued a transfer certificate. After Lei Zhenshan arrived in Nanning, he could not find work and faced even more difficult living conditions, which made him dissatisfied with the government. Therefore, the leadership should immediately stop the bad practice of certain units arbitrarily recruiting agricultural labor from rural areas, so as to avoid the increasing surplus of labor in cities and the increasing weakening of labor in agricultural production.

    各地读者来信反映农民盲目流入城市情况
    批评某些单位乱招工人和县区政府乱开介绍信的错误做法
    本报收到许多读者来信，反映各地农民盲目流向城市的严重情况，对随便到农村招聘新工人的单位和随便介绍农民到城市找职业的县区政府提出了批评和建议。现在把来信的一部分摘要发表如下：
    江苏读者丁余根、朱金海、鞠炳章来信：中央建筑工程部建筑工程公司有一位张仁驹同志，原籍是江苏丹阳新桥区界牌乡。他在二月二十三日回家后，就召集农民开会，在会上说：“现在建筑工程公司招收一批工人，名额是一百人，那个一进去就能拿到六十万元一个月的工资。”当时有些农民曾向张仁驹追问：“路程遥远，到那里是不是一定有工做？”张仁驹拍着胸膛说：“现在人民政府难道还骗人吗，我可以保证。至于路费你们可暂想办法，到北京一个月后就可以寄钱回来了。”当时正值兴修水利，全乡劳动力都集中在开河，一听到这个消息，就有一百多农民报名抢着要去。接着他们就到区政府开迁出证（已开了六十多张后，区政府才发觉这事不妥，当即停发迁出证，但对已领迁出证的农民也未加劝止）。为了解决旅费问题，他们有的向亲戚朋友商借，有的卖掉了春天的口粮，有的还卖了田。但当他们到达目的地以后却无工可做，工程公司的人向他们说：“现在天气冷，不能动工，开工时才需要人，现在你们可回去，今后一旦要人就通知你们，至于旅费，可暂由本公司预付，日后偿还。”于是发给每人路费伙食费约二十万元，就这样六十多个人又回来了。我们认为这样做法是非常错误的，建议有关部门和人员进行深刻检讨，并严肃处理这个问题。
    辽西省锦州市第一区人民政府来信：山东省阳谷县六区大布乡齐庄齐汝来等十人，持迁移证明书于三月十六日在我区西安街三十七号入户。他们还持有乡人民政府的信件，信上大意说：该十人系烧砖工人，因生活困难出外生产，特此证明。他们到锦州后有四人去沈阳、二人去鞍山，留在锦州的还有四人。我们动员他们回乡时，齐汝来说：“我们是第六区人民政府和阳谷县人民政府批准出来的。”齐协永说：“来时县里对我们说：你们去那里如找不到工作，来信给县府，我们替你们向上级联系。”又说：“我们互助组内分工，有七个劳动力在家种地。我们十人由齐汝来领导出外生产，计划到旧历三月捎回三百万元，交组里打一眼井、买二头牛，来时都订了挑战计划，我们把钱挣回家去，年底十个人都回家。”他们还说：“为了解决生活困难，县里准许我们三区和六区的群众，可随便迁往外县、市。”但他们到锦州市以后，因为找不到职业，生活发生困难，对政府表示不满，埋怨政府不照顾他们，甚至每天都到区政府要求解决他们的问题。这就增加了我们劳动就业工作的困难，在群众中也造成不良影响。我们认为阳谷县让农民向外地盲目流动的做法是不对的，这是对人民不负责任的态度。建议该县对这一问题要迅速处理，对有关人员的工作应该进行检查。
    广西读者严菁来信：广西省人民政府水利局去年曾在广西日报登过招收临时工人修水利工程的广告，今年二月，兴安县第三区双合乡有一二十个农民还向该局打听工资多少，想去应招。另外，还有些民兵也想到矿山去当工人。如灌阳二区车头乡民兵王之豪，想请假去矿山，民兵队长叫他开会，他就说：“我不是民兵了。”又有一个民兵王化元，由矿山回来，不到民兵队里学习、开会，民兵队给他提意见，他就说：“我不要民兵管，也不要乡政府和农会管，我是由工人管的。”像这种情形，在该县各区都有。这都是由于某些单位随便向农村招人以及区乡政府随便介绍所造成的。又如某单位曾在上林县招收青年农民做工，条件很宽，但名额很少，因而引起广大农民不安心农业生产。也有些地方对转业还乡生产者照顾不够，以致他们仍想回城市。如横县十区木工雷震山等是去年还乡生产的，但因返乡较迟未分得土地，生活困难，不得已要求区政府准许他返南宁复工，区政府随即开了迁出介绍信。雷震山到南宁后又找不到工做，生活更加困难，因而对政府不满。因此，领导方面应立即制止某些单位随便向农村招用农业劳动力的不良作法，免得城市剩余劳动力日益增加、而农业生产方面的劳动力日益削弱。
