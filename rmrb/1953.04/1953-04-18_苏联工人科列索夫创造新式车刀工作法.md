Soviet Worker Kolesov Creates New Type of Lathe Tool Method
How does Kolesov speed up cutting many times over?

    Soviet lathe operator V. Kolesov, from the Middle Volga Machine Tool Factory in Kuibyshev, recently created a method of using a new type of lathe tool that greatly increased the production capacity of ordinary lathes.
    Kolesov is an enthusiastic patriot and a tenacious production innovator. In order to fully utilize the capabilities of existing equipment and create more wealth for the Soviet motherland, he often studied how to make ordinary lathes achieve the efficiency of high-speed cutting lathes. After a long period of consideration, he wanted to increase the amount of feed per revolution of the workpiece. However, many people had failed in experimenting with this method in the past. If the feed of an ordinary external turning tool is increased from 0.2 mm to 2 or 3 mm, the workpiece will be left with threads. Therefore, to increase the feed, a new tool must be designed. No books, scholars, or engineers could tell him how to design it. However, lathe operators all know that the larger the radius of the tool tip, the smoother the machined surface of the workpiece. Based on this principle, Kolesov designed a tool with a large tip radius, but the feed could only be increased to 0.8 mm. Finally, he spent a lot of effort designing a new tool that met the requirements, but at this time, a new problem arose: the cut chips were not curled, but were like iron wires. With the enthusiastic help of the factory's chief engineer, I. Yakovlev, and technicians, Kolesov solved this problem and produced a tool that fully met the requirements.
    The main difference between Kolesov's new tool and ordinary external turning tools is that it has an additional cutting edge that can remove the threads and other uneven parts left on the machined surface of the workpiece due to the increased feed. This new type of tool is made of "T15K6" cemented carbide. Any skilled lathe operator can manufacture this tool. As long as there is a sufficiently powerful motor, any lathe can use this new type of tool. The feed per revolution of the workpiece can be increased to 1 mm to 3 mm, in other words, cutting can be accelerated three to eleven times. If the upper limit of the lathe allows, the feed can also be increased to 4 or 5 mm, that is to say, cutting can be accelerated nineteen to twenty-four times. Now Kolesov himself can complete six or seven work quotas every day. Lathe operators in the same workshop as him also complete several quotas every day. For example, Yefimov completes five quotas.

The Soviet Union is vigorously promoting the new type of lathe tool method

    The Soviet Union is vigorously promoting the new type of lathe tool method to promote high-speed metal cutting.
    Kolesov's new method received a widespread response immediately after it was created. The "Pravda" published an article by Academician I. Atopolevsky of the Academy of Sciences on March 30, stating: "The creative activities of advanced workers and their practices often surpass theory. The outstanding initiative of lathe operator Kolesov is a clear example." Professor I. Kapustin, Doctor of Technical Sciences of the Soviet Union, published an article in "Labor News" on January 18, advocating the combination of Kolesov's method with the achievements of P. Bykov and other innovators in high-speed cutting. He also used the example of cutting a shaft with a length of 1200 mm and a diameter of 100 mm to illustrate that if the advanced methods of Kolesov and others are comprehensively adopted, the time required for lathe operators can be shortened to one-hundred-sixtieth of the original time.
    Many advanced workers have also improved the new working method, further advancing metal processing technology. Now thousands of lathe operators, milling operators, and other metal processing technicians in the Middle Volga Machine Tool Factory in Kuibyshev, where Kolesov is located, have adopted his suggestions. Dozens of advanced workers from machine tool factories across the country have come to this factory to learn. After mastering this method, they are currently teaching it to workers in their respective factories. In the process of promoting the new method, many new records have been created. After learning the new type of lathe tool method, lathe operator F. Fomin of the "Machine Builder" factory in Omsk, Siberia, accelerated the processing speed of complex parts by nine times. Lathe operator A. Popkov of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory used Kolesov's method to grind a new type of lathe tool designed by himself. As a result, he completed a week's task in one shift with this tool. Lathe operator U. Gurgar of the Rovopress Machine Factory slightly improved Kolesov's external turning tool and was able to bore holes, increasing the processing speed of some parts by seven times. After implementing the Kolesov method, the Kozlov team of lathe operators at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant reduced the part processing time by two-thirds. At the same time, they also improved Kolesov's tool to make it suitable for vertical turret lathes and other lathes, and shortened the processing time. Currently, in order to further promote Kolesov's method, the Soviet Union is preparing to publish a large number of propaganda posters, instructions, and pamphlets. In addition, many specialized scientific conferences will be held to discuss this method.

Workers in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria are learning Kolesov's new working method

    Workers in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria are actively learning and promoting the new type of lathe tool method created by Soviet Stakhanovite worker and lathe operator Vasily Kolesov, which promotes high-speed metal cutting.
    In Poland, the Polish Metallurgical Workers' Union recently organized a one-day "Stakhanov Training Class" at the Wroclaw Mechanical Factory, the first factory in Poland to use this tool, to promote this new type of lathe tool method. More than 100 lathe operators from major factories in Lower Silesia participated in the study. The Krakow Province also held a conference to promote the Kolesov method, attended by more than 100 outstanding lathe operators from 16 advanced metal processing factories. Now, Kolesov's tools have been adopted for high-speed cutting in the mechanical workshop of the "Nowa Huta" Metallurgical United Factory, one of the largest metallurgical factories in Poland, as well as the Tarnow Mechanical Factory, the Dzerzhinsky Locomotive Manufacturing Factory, the "Ursus" Tractor Factory, and many other factories.
    Stakhanovite workers in Romania are successfully using Kolesov's new tool for high-speed metal cutting. The Central Committee of the Romanian Railway Workers' Union and the Ministry of Railways organized a conference to exchange experiences in learning the Kolesov method. Advanced workers, outstanding lathe operators, and engineers from various railway factories participated. At the meeting, lathe operators and engineers from the Grivitsa Rossi Railway Factory gave a report on the technical and organizational measures for applying the Kolesov method and promoting this method. A documentary explaining the working method was also shown at the meeting. Lathe operator Orel Andrisas and others also gave practical demonstrations, shortening the working time for cutting certain parts by four-fifths compared to the past.
    The first person in Bulgaria to adopt Kolesov's new tool was Ilya Verbanov, a lathe operator at the Sofia State Parts Factory. He studied the pattern of Kolesov's tool and made a new type of tool according to his pattern. Ilya Verbanov has achieved remarkable achievements because of adopting the Kolesov method. He completes 250 percent of his task per shift. Verbanov also taught many other workers how to use the new tool. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联工人科列索夫创造新式车刀工作法
    科列索夫怎样使切削加快很多倍？
    苏联古比雪夫中伏尔加母机制造厂车工瓦·科列索夫不久前创造了使用新式车刀的方法，使普通车床的生产能力大大提高。
    科列索夫是热情的爱国者和顽强的生产革新家。为了充分发挥现有设备的能力，给苏维埃祖国创造更多的财富，他时常研究怎样才能使普通车床的切削达到高速切削车床的效率。经过长时间的思考后，他想用加大制件每转一次的走刀量的方法。可是，以往许多人试验这种方法都失败了。如果把普通外圆车刀的走刀量由零点二公厘提高到二、三公厘，制件就会留下一道道螺纹。因此，要加大走刀量，就必须设计新的车刀。没有任何书籍、任何学者或工程师能够告诉他怎样设计。可是车工们都知道，刀尖圆角半径越大，制件加工表面也越光滑。根据这个道理，科列索夫设计出一把刀尖圆角半径很大的车刀，可是走刀量却只能提高到零点八公厘。最后，他花了很大的精力，设计出来符合要求的新车刀，可是这个时候又产生了新问题：切下来的切屑不是卷曲的，而是像铁丝一样的。在工厂的总工程师伊·雅科夫列夫和技术员的热情帮助下，科列索夫解决了这个问题，制出了完全合乎要求的车刀。
    科列索夫设计的新式车刀和普通的外圆车刀不同的地方，主要在于它有附加切削刃，可以除去因加大走刀量而在制件加工面留下的螺纹及其他不平部分。这种新型车刀是用“T15K6”硬质合金制成的。任何一个熟练的车工都可以制造这种车刀。只要有足够强有力的马达，任何一台车床都能使用这种新型车刀，制件每转一次的走刀量可以提高到一公厘至三公厘，换句话说，切削可以加快三倍到十一倍。如果车床的上限允许的话，走刀量还可以提高到四、五公厘，也就是说，切削可以加快十九倍到二十四倍。现在科列索夫本人每天就可以完成六、七个工作定额。和他同车间的车工们，每天也都完成好几个定额，例如叶菲莫夫就完成五个定额。
    苏联正大力推广新式车刀工作法
    苏联全国各地大力推广推进高速金属切削的新式车刀工作法。
    科列索夫的新方法创造出来之后，立即获得了广泛的反应。三月三十日“真理报”刊载科学院院士伊·阿托波列夫斯基的文章说：“先进工人的创造活动、他们的实践在许多场合都超过了理论。车工科列索夫的卓越创议就是一个明显的例子。”苏联技术科学博士伊·卡普斯金教授一月十八日在“劳动报”上发表文章，主张把科列索夫的方法和帕·比科夫及其他革新者在高速切削方面的成就结合在一起运用。他还以切削一件长一千二百公厘、直径一百公厘的轴作例子，来说明如果综合采用科列索夫等人的先进方法，可以把车工所需的时间缩短到原来时间的一百六十分之一。
    许多先进工作者并改进了新工作法，把金属加工技术更向前推进。现在科列索夫所在的古比雪夫中伏尔加母机制造厂上千个车工、铣工和其他金属加工技工都采用了他的建议。各地母机工厂到这个工厂来学习的先进工人已有好几十人。他们掌握了这一工作法后，目前正在把它传授给各自工厂的工人。在推广新法过程中，许多新纪录创造出来了。西伯利亚鄂木斯克“机器制造者”工厂车工费·福明学习新式车刀工作法后，把复杂制件的加工速度加快了九倍。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的车工亚·波普科夫利用科列索夫的方法磨制出他自己所设计的新式车刀，结果用这种车刀在一班时间里完成了一个星期的任务。罗夫压辗机工厂的车工乌·古尔加尔把科列索夫外圆车刀稍加改进后，就可以镗孔，使一些制件的加工速度增加了七倍。乌拉尔重型机械制造厂的车工科兹洛夫工作组在推行科列索夫方法后，把制件加工时间减少了三分之二。同时他们还改进了科列索夫的车刀，使它适用于立式转塔车床及其他车床，并使加工时间缩短。目前为了进一步推广科列索夫的方法，苏联准备出版大批宣传画、说明书和小册子。此外，还将举行许多专门科学会议来讨论这个方法。
    波、罗、保等国工人学习科列索夫新工作法
    波兰、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的工人正在积极学习和推广苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工作者、车工瓦西里·科列索夫创造的、推进高速金属切削的新式车刀工作法。
    在波兰，波兰冶金工人工会最近在波兰第一个使用这种车刀的弗罗茨拉大机械工厂组织了一天“斯塔哈诺夫训练班”来推广这种新式车刀工作法。参加学习的有下西里西亚各大工厂的一百多名车工。克拉科夫省也召开了推广科列索夫工作法的会议，参加会议的有十六个先进的金属加工工厂的一百多名优秀车工。现在，波兰最大的冶金工厂之一——“诺瓦胡塔”冶金联合工厂的机械车间、塔尔诺机械厂、捷尔任斯基机车制造厂、“乌尔苏斯”拖拉机工厂及其他许多工厂都已采用了科列索夫的车刀进行高速切削。
    罗马尼亚的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者正在成功地采用科列索夫新式车刀进行高速金属切削。罗马尼亚铁路工人工会中央委员会和铁道部组织了一个交换科列索夫工作法学习经验的会议。参加的有各铁路工厂的先进工作者、优秀车工和工程师。会上，格里维查萨·罗西铁路工厂的车工和工程师作了关于应用科列索夫工作法和推广这个工作法的技术—组织措施的报告。会上还放映了解释该工作法的纪录片。车工奥列尔·安德里萨斯等还作了实习表演，他们切削某些零件的工作时间比以前缩短了五分之四。
    保加利亚首先采用科列索夫新式车刀的是索非亚国营零件工厂的车工伊里亚·维尔巴诺夫。他研究了科列索夫车刀的图案，并按照他的图案制成了新型的车刀。伊里亚·维尔巴诺夫因为采用了科列索夫方法，获得了卓越的成就。他每班完成任务百分之二百五十。维尔巴诺夫还教会了许多其他的工人使用新式车刀。    （据新华社讯）
