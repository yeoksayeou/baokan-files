National Industrial Technical Secondary Schools
This Summer Will Be Greatly Adjusted and Consolidated with Focused Development

In order to more effectively cultivate intermediate-level technical personnel for economic construction, national industrial technical secondary schools will undergo major adjustment and consolidation during this summer vacation, and will be developed in a planned and focused manner on the basis of the adjustment and consolidation. At present, most regions have formulated adjustment and consolidation plans, which have been reviewed and approved by the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government in conjunction with the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government. The Central South Region began its adjustment in March.

In the past three years, industrial technical secondary schools nationwide have developed greatly. By 1952, the total number of students in industrial technical secondary schools had reached more than 118,000, an increase of approximately 321% compared to 1950. However, the development of technical secondary schools in the past had a great deal of blindness. The establishment of schools lacked a definite plan, and a large proportion of industrial technical schools were led by local authorities. Schools did not set up specialized programs, and the training objectives were not clear. There was a shortage of teachers, and their quality was poor. The academic system and teaching work were also chaotic. This situation seriously affected the quality of teaching, making it impossible to train qualified intermediate-level technical personnel. In order to change this situation, some regions had conducted preliminary adjustments to industrial technical secondary schools in 1952. However, that adjustment did not learn from the advanced Soviet experience in technical education, and the issue of specialized program settings was not resolved. The adjusted schools still could not meet the needs of national construction work.

This year's adjustment and consolidation of technical secondary schools will be based on the central cultural and educational work policy of "consolidation, focused development, ensuring quality, and steady progress." Industrial technical secondary schools will be the focus, first strengthening the planning of work, overcoming blindness, and strengthening the centralized and unified leadership in terms of policies, school establishment, specialized program settings, and school systems. In order to meet the needs of the current national planned economic construction, most of the industrial technical secondary schools led by local authorities will be transferred to the leadership of relevant central business departments, especially ensuring the needs of the heavy industry sector. The current adjustment of industrial technical secondary schools in the Central South Region is being carried out in accordance with the principle of centralization and unification. With the exception of individual schools still under the leadership of the Greater Administrative Area, all other industrial schools in the region have been transferred to the leadership of relevant central business departments, and no schools have been retained by provinces and cities. The principles of specialization and singularization will be implemented in the adjustment and consolidation. Each technical secondary school must set up specialized programs, clarify training objectives, and schools should have a division of labor to train specialized personnel in various fields. This will change the past phenomenon of comprehensive technical education.

According to the adjusted materials and adjustment plans of the major administrative regions (adjustment plans for the Northeast and North China regions have not yet been finalized), the number of national industrial technical secondary schools will be adjusted from 188 to 179 (some schools will be converted into technical worker schools after the adjustment), with a total of 115,490 students. Enrollment during the summer vacation will be greatly expanded. Among the 179 schools, 127 are led by relevant central industrial departments, and 52 are led by local business departments.

Based on advanced Soviet experience and China's actual conditions, the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government and the relevant central business departments have comprehensively studied the issue of specialized program settings in national industrial technical secondary schools, determined the principles for setting up specialized programs, and planned to set up specialized programs proportionally. Industrial technical schools in each region will have an appropriate division of labor. Each school will concentrate its efforts on running several specialized programs well. National industrial technical schools will set up more than 100 specialized programs before the summer vacation to train various specialized technical personnel. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国工业性质的中等技术学校
    今年暑假将大力调整整顿并重点发展
    为了更有效地培养中级经济建设技术人材，全国工业性质的中等技术学校将在今年暑假期中大力进行调整整顿工作，并在调整整顿的基础上有计划有重点地发展。目前大部分地区已制订出调整整顿方案，并经中央人民政府高等教育部会同中央人民政府财政经济委员会审查决定。中南区已在三月间开始调整。
    全国工业性质中等技术学校三年来有很大发展，到一九五二年为止，工业性质中等技术学校学生总数已达到十一万八千多人，比一九五零年约增加了百分之三百二十一。但过去中等技术学校的发展带有很大的盲目性，学校设置没有一定的计划，工业性质的技术学校中地方领导的学校所占比例很大；学校未设置专业，培养目标不明确；师资量少质差；学制和教学工作都还混乱。这种情况严重地影响到教学质量，就不可能培养出合乎规格的中等技术人材。为了改变这种情况，部分地区虽然曾在一九五二年对工业性质的中等技术学校进行过初步调整；但那次调整由于没有很好学习苏联先进的技术教育经验，专业设置问题也没有解决，调整后的学校仍不能适应国家建设工作的要求。
    今年调整整顿中等技术学校的工作，将根据中央文教工作“整顿巩固、重点发展、保证质量、稳步前进”的方针，以工业性质中等技术学校为重点，首先加强工作的计划性，克服盲目性，加强方针、政策、学校设置、专业设置、学校制度等方面的集中统一领导。为了适应当前国家有计划的经济建设的需要，并将大部分地方领导的工业性质中等技术学校改由中央有关业务部门领导，特别保证重工业部门的需要。中南区工业性质的中等技术学校这次调整就是根据集中统一的原则进行的。全区工业性质学校除个别学校仍属大区领导外，其他都改由中央有关业务部门领导，各省市没有保留学校。在调整整顿中贯彻专业化单一化的原则，各个中等技术学校必须设置专业，明确培养目标，学校之间有所分工，以培养各方面的专业人材。这就改变了过去一揽子综合性技术教育的现象。
    根据各大行政区已经调整的材料和调整计划（东北、华北两区调整方案尚未订），全国工业性质的中等技术学校将由一百八十八所调整为一百七十九所（调整后将有一部分学校改为技工学校），学生人数共有十一万五千四百九十人。暑假招生将大大发展。一百七十九所学校中由中央有关产业部门领导的学校一百二十七所，地方业务部门领导的五十二所。
    中央人民政府高等教育部和中央各有关业务部门根据苏联先进经验和我国实际情况，全面地研究了全国工业性质中等技术学校的专业设置问题，确定了专业设置原则，有计划地按比例设置专业。每一个地区的工业技术学校并有适当的分工。每一个学校集中力量办好几种专业。全国工业技术学校将在暑假前分别设置一百多种专业，培养各种不同的专业技术人材。（据新华社讯）
