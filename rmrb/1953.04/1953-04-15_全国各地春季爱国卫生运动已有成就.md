The spring patriotic health campaign has been launched across the country since February. During this campaign, various regions have focused on tasks such as digging up fly pupae and clearing garbage, laying the foundation for further development of the patriotic health campaign this year.

The spring patriotic health campaign in North China has generally concluded. Beijing has universally carried out pupae digging and general cleaning during the spring patriotic health campaign.

Tianjin's spring patriotic health campaign started on April 1st and lasted until the 11th. Except for some factories, all organs, schools, shops, and residents in the city universally carried out pupae digging and cleaning. On the 11th, the first city-wide cleaning inspection was conducted. Before the start of the campaign, the Tianjin Patriotic Health Movement Committee selected a group of health cadres for training, preparing them to serve as the backbone for training grassroots health workers in various districts. Currently, more than 5,000 health workers have completed training throughout the city. The Guanting Reservoir construction site in Hebei Province launched a spring patriotic health campaign in late March. The Health Bureau of the North China Administrative Council and the Health Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government dispatched health workers to the Guanting Reservoir construction site to assist in the work. The new village, where more than 20,000 migrant workers reside, has been divided into clean and sanitary responsibility areas to strengthen environmental sanitation work.

Various provinces and cities in East China have successively launched spring patriotic health campaigns since February. All regions have widely mobilized the masses to dig up fly pupae, striving to become fly-free areas this summer. Nanjing has conducted planned pupae digging. Some areas have seen smoother progress in the health campaign because it has been integrated with production and central tasks. Guashan No. 2 Village in Shangtang District, Hangzhou, combined the work of water conservancy construction with dredging a stagnant ditch, and also sent the 8,000 dan of sludge dug out to mulberry fields as fertilizer. The state-owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory washed its machines during the Patriotic Health Campaign Month, reducing the fly ash adhesion rate of twill fabric by 1.6 percent.

Northeast China generally launched spring patriotic health campaigns from mid-March. Fushun has carried out mass pupae digging, and by April 1st, it had dug up more than 32,000 jin of fly pupae. By March 8th, Lushun-Dalian had dug up more than 13.6 million fly pupae. Farmers in Xinhua Fang, a suburb of Lushun, created a method of replacing old soil with new soil during pupae digging, which not only eliminated the pupae but also increased fertilizer. While digging up fly pupae, Northeast China also paid attention to improving environmental and personal hygiene. Many factories in Shenyang washed machines, cleaned workshops, and mobilized workers to dismantle and wash bedding. The Tiexi District Cleaning Team and Manure Collection Team jointly challenged various districts to ensure good cleaning work. The city's restaurant industry also challenged other industries to strive to become a model sanitary industry in the second quarter.

Ulanhot City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is launching a spring patriotic health campaign. Before the start of the spring health campaign, the city's Patriotic Health Movement Committee used small seminars to mobilize people at all levels and trained health committee members from various districts and industries, as well as health committee members from various organs. The city's Cultural Center coordinated with the city-wide Patriotic Health Movement Mobilization Conference to set up a Patriotic Health Hall and held a photo exhibition. Street offices established work groups to be responsible for publicity and inspection. A general inspection of the city's wells, ditches, and housing was carried out. The city's health organizations also conducted a survey of the health status of the masses in public places. Currently, residents in the city are establishing patriotic health covenants and a patriotic health day system.

The spring patriotic health work in most areas of Central South China has ended. Great achievements have been made in digging up pupae and clearing garbage. During this campaign, organs, remote areas, and some industrial and mining enterprises were also mobilized to vigorously carry out spring health work. Wuhan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces have successively carried out pupae digging and general cleaning since February. The Wuhan Patriotic Health Movement Committee and the public security departments completed the work of modifying Taiping water buckets in March.

The spring patriotic health campaigns have been launched successively in Southwest China. Currently, the blitz campaigns in Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and Ya'an are underway, except for Chengdu, where the campaign was launched earlier and has already ended. The campaign is also underway in some rural and ethnic minority areas. Cadres in various organs have also begun to move. Most organs at the Southwest Regional and Chongqing Municipal levels have established Patriotic Health Movement Committees.

During this spring patriotic health campaign, the Beijing Municipal Government, the East China Patriotic Health Movement Committee, and the health organs of Shanxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Suiyuan, Jilin, and other provinces successively organized inspection teams to conduct inspections in various cities, counties, towns, villages, factories, mines, organs, and schools. Various regions have discovered many shortcomings and problems in health work during the inspection. Beijing encouraged units that had done well in health work during the inspection and criticized units that did not pay attention to health work, such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. The publicity work in various parts of East China was generally insufficient, so that the masses did not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of the patriotic health campaign. The masses in many areas have not yet been mobilized. The movement in most areas has remained in the cities, and very little has been done in the rural areas, or even no action at all. Some areas do not pay attention to the patriotic health campaign. For example, the patriotic health leadership organization in Zhejiang Province only issued one instruction during the blitz campaign, without making any specific arrangements or conducting supervision and inspection. Therefore, the patriotic health campaign in the province has been carried out very poorly (and is currently being corrected). The leadership in Suzhou only cared about the central work, and put the spring health campaign aside. Many factories and catering industries in some areas do not pay enough attention to health work. For example, the Nanjing Dyeing and Weaving Factory did not move at all during this blitz campaign. The factory was very dirty, and the machines were covered with grease. The sanitary equipment of the cooperative food factory in Nanjing was very poor, the utensils were not clean, and the workers did not even cut their fingernails often. The sanitary conditions of the workshop of Shanghai Guanshengyuan Food Company were also very poor. The inspection in Shanxi Province revealed that the Patriotic Health Movement Committees in many units existed in name only. Some units, such as various factories in Taiyuan City, Taiyuan Engineering Company, and the City Cultural Affairs Bureau, have not yet established a well-organized Patriotic Health Movement Committee and a sanitation system. Although some units have established sanitation work systems, they have not been implemented.

    全国各地春季爱国卫生运动已有成就
    全国各地从今年二月份起先后开始了春季爱国卫生突击运动。在这次突击运动中，各地都有重点地进行了挖蝇蛹，清除垃圾等工作，为今年进一步开展爱国卫生运动打下了基础。
    华北地区的春季爱国卫生突击运动，大体上已经结束。北京市在春季爱国卫生突击运动中普遍进行了挖蛹和大扫除。
    天津市春季爱国卫生突击运动于四月一日开始到十一日为止，除部分工厂外，市内各机关、学校、商店和居民都普遍进行了挖蝇蛹和清扫等工作。十一日开展了第一次全市性的清洁大检查。在运动开始前，天津市爱国卫生运动委员会选拔了一批卫生干部进行训练，准备把他们作为训练各区基层卫生工作人员的骨干。现全市训练完毕的卫生工作人员已有五千多人。河北省官厅水库工地在三月下旬开展了春季爱国卫生突击运动。华北行政委员会卫生局和河北省人民政府卫生厅分别派遣卫生工作人员到官厅水库工地协助工作。现在两万多民工聚居的新村，已划分了清洁卫生责任区，加强了环境卫生工作。
    华东区各省市从二月份以来已先后展开春季爱国卫生突击运动。各地都广泛地发动群众挖蝇蛹，争取今年夏天成为无蝇地区。南京市曾有计划地进行了挖蛹工作。有些地区由于结合了生产和中心工作，卫生运动进行得比较顺利。杭州市上塘区瓜山二村结合兴修水利的工作，挖通了一条死水沟，还将挖出来的八千担污泥送到桑园地里当肥料。国营上海第六棉纺织厂在爱国卫生突击月中洗刷了机器，减少了斜纹布飞花附着率百分之一点六。
    东北各地从三月中旬起普遍展开了春季爱国卫生突击运动。抚顺市曾进行了群众性的挖蝇蛹工作，到四月一日为止已挖蝇蛹三万二千多市斤。旅大市到三月八日止，已挖蝇蛹一千三百六十多万个。旅顺市郊新华坊农民在挖蛹中创造了用新土换旧土的办法，不但挖掉了蝇蛹，而且增加了肥料。沈阳市第一玻璃厂向各工厂挑战，要挖净蝇蛹，争取成为无蝇的工厂。和挖蝇蛹同时，东北各地也注意了改进环境卫生和个人卫生工作。沈阳市许多工厂都擦洗了机器，打扫了车间，并发动工人拆洗被褥。铁西区清洁队和粪车队联合向各区挑战，保证做好清扫工作；全市饭馆业也向各业挑战，争取在第二季度成为全市模范卫生行业。
    内蒙古自治区乌兰浩特市正展开春季爱国卫生突击运动。该市爱国卫生运动委员会在春季卫生突击运动开始前，曾用召开小型座谈会的方式，层层进行动员，并训练了各区行业卫生委员及机关卫生委员。市文化馆配合全市爱国卫生运动动员大会布置了爱国卫生馆，举办图片展览；各街道成立了工作组，负责宣传和检查等工作。对全市的水井、沟渠和住房普遍进行了检查。市卫生组织并在公共场所进行了群众健康状况的调查。现在，市内居民正在订立爱国卫生公约和爱国卫生日制度。
    中南区大部分地区的春季爱国卫生突击工作已经结束。在挖蛹、清除垃圾方面都取得了很大成绩。在这次运动中，机关、边远地区和某些工矿企业单位也都发动起来，大力进行春季卫生工作。武汉市和广东、广西、湖南、湖北等省，从二月间起都先后进行了挖蝇蛹，大扫除。武汉市爱国卫生运动委员会和公安部门，在三月间完成了改装太平水桶的工作。
    西南各地已陆续展开春季爱国卫生突击运动。目前，全区除成都市因运动开展较早已经结束外，重庆、昆明、贵阳、雅安等城市的突击运动正在进行中。一部分农村和少数民族地区，运动也正在进行中。各地机关干部也开始动起来。西南区和重庆市一级大多数机关，都成立了爱国卫生运动委员会。
    在此次春季爱国卫生突击运动中，北京市、华东爱国卫生运动委员会以及山西、广东、福建、绥远、吉林等省的卫生机关，曾先后组织了检查组，到各市、县、镇、村和厂矿、机关、学校进行了检查。各地从检查中发现了许多卫生工作中的缺点和问题，北京市在检查中鼓励了卫生工作做得好的单位，批评了不重视卫生工作的单位——石景山钢铁厂。华东区各地的宣传工作普遍做得不够，以致群众对爱国卫生运动的政治意义认识不足。不少地区的群众还未发动起来，多数地区的运动停留在城市，农村做得很不够，甚至连动也没有动起来。部分地区不重视爱国卫生运动。如浙江省的爱国卫生领导机构只在突击运动中发过一次指示，没有作任何的具体布置，也不进行督促检查。因此全省的爱国卫生运动开展得很差（目前已在注意纠正中）。苏州的领导方面，只管中心工作，而把春季卫生突击工作放在一边了。若干地区的许多工厂、饮食行业，都对卫生工作不够重视，如南京染织厂在这次突击运动中根本没有动起来，厂内很脏，机器上都是油腻。南京市的合作社食品厂的卫生设备很差，用具不清洁，工人连指甲也不常剪。上海冠生园食品公司工场的卫生状况也很不好。山西省从检查中发现不少单位的爱国卫生运动委员会是有名无实的，有的单位，如太原市各工厂、太原市工程公司和市文化事业管理局等，到现在还没有很好地建立起爱国卫生运动委员会的组织和卫生制度。有些单位虽然建立了卫生工作制度，但都没有执行。
