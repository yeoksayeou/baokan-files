Excessive Meetings in Rural Areas Across China Seriously Hinder Spring Plowing and Production

    Hebei Province, Xincheng County
    One Village Held Six Meetings in One Day
    District and Village Cadres Were Left Confused
    Xincheng County, Hebei Province, has a total of 415 villages, with only Yuanzhuang performing relatively well in production. However, even the cadres in Yuanzhuang felt that there were many obstacles to making spring plowing and production the overriding central task. One day, six cadres from higher-level organs came to the village. Armed cadres sought the village head to compile militia figures, supply and marketing cooperative cadres promoted new-style plows, and bank cadres handled loans, all wanting to hold meetings. Six meetings, large and small, were held in one day, leaving the village cadres confused and unsure of which work was truly important. The county had also convened production meetings, which village cadres attended, but upon returning to their villages, they still didn't know what to do. When the county arranged work, it didn't clearly point out that spring plowing and production was the overriding central task, nor did it explain specific methods for combining various tasks. District cadres failed to grasp the central task, remaining busy all day without making progress, and spring plowing and production remained in a state of laissez-faire. The secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the head of the Fourth District were almost always in the countryside working from dawn until around 10 PM, working hard all day long, but they could not improve spring plowing and production.

    Shandong Province, Huantai County
    Many Meetings in Various Townships, But Problems Remain Unsolved
    A Waste of the People's Precious Time
    Huantai County, Shandong Province, townships are busy holding meetings, neglecting production and drought prevention. Dongliu Township held meetings almost every day in March. From March 15th to 17th, Dongliu Village held four village-wide meetings, large and small, in three days. These meetings rarely solved problems. On the evening of the 16th, two meetings were held simultaneously in the village: one was a meeting for military families, originally intended to solve the issue of substitute farming. However, due to insufficient preparation, the meeting lasted a long time without results, causing dissatisfaction among some military families. The other was a meeting for mutual aid team leaders, led by staff from the County People's Government and cadres from the Special Commissioner's Office who were there to inspect work. The original intention was to report on the current production work situation, exchange experiences, and discuss how to revise production plans. As a result, the meeting lasted a long time, only registering and counting figures for tree planting, purchasing improved seeds, applying topdressing fertilizer to wheat, and planting spring fields. Finally, they briefly mentioned the need to seize the current tasks and adjourned the meeting. Of the sixteen people who attended, four or five were dozing off. The township also held many meetings, large and small, to formulate production plans. However, the cadres sent by the County People's Government to assist in the work simply said, "It is necessary to seize the formulation of plans, and to formulate them according to the situation of each group," without investigating and understanding what problems had occurred in the past in formulating plans, nor understanding whether it was possible to universally formulate production plans. As a result, the plans formulated by the mutual aid teams were mostly formalistic and could not play any role in production, only wasting time on holding meetings and formulating plans.

    Henan Province, Neihuang County
    District and Township Cadres Only Hold Meetings and Cannot Lead Production
    The Masses Want to Plant Crops, But District Cadres Tell Them to Attend Meetings
    In Neihuang County, Henan Province, many cadres are busy holding meetings and cannot properly lead production. The Sixth District has two county committee members directly leading production and is an advanced district in the county. However, the production situation in this district is very poor. From the sixteenth day of the first lunar month to the fourth day of the second lunar month, the cadres of this district went to the countryside and generally convened township mass meetings, propaganda meetings for the "Three Major Tasks of 1953" attended by more than ten villages, and meetings for establishing townships and rectifying the Party. Cadres convened a township mass meeting in Xiaohualin, and cadres in Guanzhai Village unloaded the masses' eight carts of manure and soil, forcing them to attend the meeting. The masses reflected, "Speaking the truth, selling fake medicine, calling for production, but not letting us produce." This meeting was not fully prepared in advance, and five cadres from the militia, women's federation, and other organizations spoke at the meeting, each talking about the importance of their own work, and only mentioning spring plowing and production at the end. Too many meetings made the village cadres worried. Liu Junmin, the director of the women's federation in Guanzhai Village, said, "The district cadres only talk about leading production, and after making arrangements, they don't care anymore. We only hold meetings and have no way to lead production." The masses' urgent demand is to grow vegetables well, which is a major plan for the whole year's life, but the district cadres do not allow them to grow vegetables, stubbornly holding meetings. The masses said: growing vegetables is a major issue, and it is busier than the wheat harvest at this time. We can't afford to hold meetings day and night. When cadres reported on their work, they also said that the village had a "habit" of holding frequent meetings.

    The district cadres themselves are also busy holding meetings, and they spend less time working in the countryside. After the Spring Festival and before March 20th, except for district head Cui Wenrui, who worked in the village for half a month, the rest of the cadres were either attending meetings in the county or in the district. Agricultural cadre Ma Qiuhai only worked in the countryside for four days, and cultural and educational assistant Li Zhirun only worked in the countryside for three days. Some cadres were attending meetings in the county and did not return to the district for a long time. Even those who went down to lead production only ran to this village to count production figures, and to that village to listen to village cadres' reports, staying at the level of general appeals and failing to go deep into the work. The cadres of the "key villages" did not seriously cultivate the key points and promote the general, but only regarded the "key villages" as residences for cadres.

    Zhejiang Province, Fuyang County
    One Township Held Twenty-Six Meetings in Twenty-Three Days
    Many Township Cadres Cannot Produce and Lack Food
    In the current tense production season, the excessive number of meetings held in Changan Township and Wangzhou Township in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, seriously affects farmers' production.

    Changan Township holds an average of sixteen or seventeen cadre meetings per month. Most of these meetings are held during the day, lasting from half a day to a full day. Dong Yonggen, deputy director of the township's preferential treatment committee, said that he has four to five fixed meetings every month, and even more unfixed meetings. From March 1st to 16th, Dong Yonggen attended six temporary meetings. Including the fixed meetings, he alone spent thirteen or fourteen days each month in meetings. From the time he started harvesting rice last August until now, he has spent most of his time attending meetings outside, and rarely goes to the fields to produce, so he has only worked thirty-eight labor days. Wang Liangcheng, director of the agricultural production cooperative, spends even more time attending meetings. Last year, he attended a total of 268 days of meetings and only did 28 labor days of production work.

    Wangzhou Township also holds many meetings. From March 1st to 23rd, the Township People's Government convened a total of 26 meetings, including meetings of militia squad leaders and above, expanded meetings of village cadres, meetings of inspection team leaders, meetings of all militiamen, relief meetings, township mutual aid and cooperation committees, mutual aid team leader meetings, township mediation committees, township preferential treatment committees, township women's representative meetings, township cultural and educational health committees, meetings of representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents, meetings of the Township People's Government Committee, meetings of the township armed security committee, meetings of all township youth league members, meetings of all township backbone militiamen, silkworm farming meetings, expanded meetings of the Township People's Government Committee, militia company commander meetings, etc. The above meetings totaled 5,362 attendees, and each meeting generally lasted half a day, with the longest meetings lasting from morning to evening. In total, the time spent in these meetings could be converted into 2,784 workdays.

    Because there are too many meetings and a lack of sufficient preparation, not only can problems not be solved, but time is wasted, seriously affecting current production. For example, among the 25 members of the Changan Township People's Government Committee, six are currently out of food, and five are short of food. One of the reasons for the food shortage is that too many meetings have affected production.

    Shaanxi Province, Jingyang County
    Many Cadres Live a "Meeting Life" Every Day
    Only Appeals for Spring Plowing Without Concrete Leadership
    In Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, as of March 15th, most districts and townships were still focusing on publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law and rectifying the Party, relaxing or abandoning leadership over spring plowing and production. Of the county's nearly 400,000 mu of wheat fields, less than 30% had been weeded. What is particularly serious is that Jingyang County is a major cotton-producing area, and only about 30% of all cotton fields (330,000 mu) have been plowed this spring. When agricultural technology guidance station cadres go to the countryside to provide technical guidance, they simply read the articles to everyone, without combining them with the specific situation of the local area to solve the ideological problems of the masses, nor organizing the masses to learn. Pests have already occurred in the wheat fields, but the cadres in various places have not led the masses to eliminate them in time. In Yuchi Township, Sixth District, pests have occurred in the wheat fields, and the local workgroup leader is not even aware of it.

    The leadership in Jingyang County did not specifically teach the cadres below working methods and policy boundaries and lacked a clear division of labor, only using meetings and instructions to lead, thus making the cadres below unsure of how to carry out their work. Even the workgroup cadres in the county leadership's key village—Shiwang Village, Sanqu Qukou Township—were each holding their own meetings: one for rectifying the Party, one for publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law, and another for "appealing" for spring plowing. Party member cadres in Shiwangjia Village, Sanqu, were specifically engaged in rectifying the Party, while non-Party cadres were "appealing" for production, with no connection between them, and various tasks were seriously disconnected. The masses were confused and dizzy, complaining that the cadres held too many meetings and did not care about practical difficulties. Many cadres were living a lengthy "meeting life" every day. From March 1st to 9th, the workgroup in Baxiang, Second District, convened a total of nine meetings, attended by more than 320 grassroots cadres. One meeting every day made the grassroots cadres complain incessantly, and naturally, they had no energy to lead production.

    County Party Secretary Pan Shengxi, County Chief Feng Shiguang, and others have recently gone to the countryside for inspection and held a joint meeting of district party secretaries and district heads on March 15th. They made a preliminary analysis of the problems existing in the work and put forward some suggestions for improvement: "In accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, put spring plowing as the overriding central task, and other work can be appropriately combined." However, they have not taught more specific methods, especially paying insufficient attention to spring irrigation and plowing of cotton fields, and have not formulated effective measures to make up for the losses caused by past relaxation of leadership in spring production.

    各地农村开会太多严重妨碍春耕生产
    河北省新城县
    一个村子一天开了六个会
    区村干部被弄得糊里糊涂
    河北省新城县共有四百一十五个村，生产较好的只有一个苑庄。但苑庄的干部也感到把春耕生产作为压倒一切的中心任务，还有很多障碍。有一天，这个村里就来了六个上级机关的干部。武装干部找村长统计民兵数字，物资供应社干部推销新式步犁，银行干部办理贷款，大家都要开会。一天开了大小六个会，把村干部弄得糊里糊涂，摸不清到底什么工作重要。县里也召开过生产会议，各村干部也参加了，可是回到村里还是不知道该怎么办。县里布置工作的时候，就没有明确地指出春耕生产是压倒一切的中心任务，更没有讲清各种工作结合的具体办法。区干部抓不住中心，成天忙得不行，春耕生产还是陷于自流状态。中共四区区委书记和四区区长，差不多每天总是天一亮就下乡工作，到晚上十点钟左右才回机关，一天到晚辛辛苦苦，顾此失彼，就是不能把春耕生产搞好。
    山东省桓台县
    各乡开会很多但不解决问题
    白白浪费了群众的宝贵时间
    山东省桓台县各乡开会忙，生产防旱都顾不上。东刘乡三月间几乎天天有会。东刘村从三月十五日到十七日，三天里就开了全村性的大小会议四次。这些会议都很少解决问题。这个村十六日晚上同时召开两个会：一个是军属会议，原来打算解决代耕问题。但因事先准备不够，开了许久，无结果而散，反而引起有些军属不满。一个是互助组长会议，由县人民政府工作人员和专署到这里检查工作的干部掌握，原来的意图是汇报当前生产工作情况，交流经验，商量怎样修订生产计划。结果，会开了很久，只是登记、统计了植树、买良种、追麦肥、种春地的数目字，最后简单地讲了一下要抓紧当前的几项工作，就散会了。到会十六人，就有四五个人打盹睡觉。这个乡为了订生产计划，也开了不少次大大小小的会。可是，县人民政府派来帮助工作的干部只是简单地讲“要抓紧订计划，要根据各组的情况来订”，但没有调查了解过去订计划中发生过什么问题，也不了解究竟可能不可能普遍订出生产计划来。结果，各互助组订的计划大都是形式主义的，对生产不能起什么作用，只是白白浪费了开会订计划的时间。
    河南省内黄县
    区乡干部光开会没法领导生产
    群众要求种地区干部却叫开会
    河南省内黄县很多干部忙于开会，不能好好领导生产。第六区有两个县委委员直接领导生产，是全县的先进区。但这个区的生产情况却很不好。从旧历正月十六到二月初四，这个区的干部分别下乡，普遍召开了乡群众会，十余村一起开的“一九五三年三大任务”宣传大会，和建乡、整党等会议。干部在小槐林召开全乡群众大会，官砦村干部把群众的八辆送粪拉土的车卸了，强迫群众参加会议。群众反映：“说真方，卖假药，喊着生产，不叫生产。”这个大会事前没有充分准备，会上由民兵、妇联等五个干部讲了话，各讲各的工作重要，最后才提了一下春耕生产。开会多了，村干部也发愁。官砦村妇女主任刘俊民说：“区干部光说领导生产，往下一布置就不管啦。俺光开会，也没法领导生产。”群众的迫切要求是种好菜，这是全年生活大计，区干部却不让种菜，硬着脖子光开会。群众说：种菜是大事，这时候比大麦天还忙，黑夜白天开会，可开不起。干部汇报工作时还说这村有经常开会的“习惯”。
    区干部本身也忙着开会，下乡工作的时间少。在春节后、三月二十日前，区里除了区长崔文瑞在村工作半月以外，其余干部不是在县开会，就是在区开会。农业干事马秋海下乡工作只有四天，文教助理李之润下乡只有三天，有的在县开会长期不回区。就是下去领导生产，也是跑这村统计一下生产数字，跑那村听听村干部汇报，停留在一般号召上，不能深入下去。“重点村”的干部，也没有认真培养重点，推动一般，只是把“重点村”作为干部的居留地。
    浙江省富阳县
    一个乡二十三天开会二十六次
    很多乡干部不能生产断粮缺粮
    浙江省富阳县常安乡、王洲乡在当前紧张的生产季节中，召开会议过多，严重地影响了农民生产。
    常安乡平均每月召开干部会十六、七次。这些会议大部在白天召开，时间一天、半天不等。乡优抚委员会副主任董永根说，他每月固定的会议就有四天至五天，不固定的会议更多。三月一日到十六日，董永根就参加了临时性的会议六次，连固定的会议计算在内，他一个人每月开会时间就要十三、四天。他从去年八月割稻开始到目前止，大部分时间在外边开会，很少下田生产，因此只做了三十八个劳动日。农业生产合作社社长汪良成，参加会议的时间更多，去年一年中，共开会二百六十八天，只做了二十八个劳动日的生产工作。
    王洲乡召开的会议也很多。从三月一日至二十三日，乡人民政府共召开了二十六次会议，这些会议包括民兵小队长以上干部会议、乡村干部扩大会议、检查组长会议、全体民兵会议、救济会议、乡互助合作委员会、互助组长会议、乡调解委员会、乡优抚委员会、乡妇女代表会、乡文教卫生委员会、烈军属代表会、乡人民政府委员会、乡武装治安委员会、全乡青年团员大会、全乡基干民兵会、蚕桑会议、乡人民政府委员会扩大会议、民兵中队长会议等等，以上会议共计到会人数五千三百六十二人，每次会议一般有半天时间，时间最长的会从早晨开到晚上才结束，总共这些会议时间，可折合二千七百八十四个工。
    因为会议多，又缺乏足够准备，不仅不能解决问题，而且浪费时间，严重地影响了当前的生产。如常安乡二十五个乡人民政府委员中，目前有六人断粮，有五人缺粮，断粮和缺粮的原因之一，是因开会过多，而影响了生产。
    陕西省泾阳县
    许多干部每天过着“会议生活”
    对春耕只有号召没有具体领导
    陕西省泾阳县到三月十五日为止，大部区、乡仍然只是集中精力搞宣传贯彻婚姻法和整党工作，放松或放弃了春耕生产的领导工作。全县近四十万亩麦田，锄过草的不到百分之三十。特别严重的是，泾阳县是主要产棉地区，而全部棉地（三十三万亩）在今春翻过的仅有百分之三十左右。农业技术指导站干部下乡巡回传授技术时，也只是照条文向大家念一遍，没结合当地具体情况解决群众思想问题，也未组织群众学习。麦地已发生了虫害，各地干部也没有及时领导群众扑灭。六区榆次乡麦地中发生了虫害，当地的工作组长还不知道。
    泾阳县领导方面没有具体地教给下边干部工作方法、政策界限，缺乏明确的分工，只是用会议、指示等来领导，因而使下边干部不知如何进行工作。连县领导的重点村——三区三渠口乡史王村的工作组干部，也是各召开各的会，整党一个会，宣传贯彻婚姻法一个会，“号召”春耕又是一个会。三区师王家党员干部专门搞整党，非党干部“号召”生产，互不联系，各种工作严重脱节。群众被整得头昏眼花，埋怨干部开会太多，不管实际困难，许多干部每天过着冗长的“会议生活”。二区八乡的工作组从三月一日到九日共召开了九个会，参加的基层干部三百二十多人。每天一个会，使基层干部叫苦不止，自然就没有精力去领导生产了。
    县委书记潘生玺、县长冯世光等，最近曾下乡作了检查，并在三月十五日召开了区委书记、区长联席会议，对于工作中存在的问题作了初步的分析，并提出了一些改进意见：“依照中共中央西北局指示精神，把春耕列为压倒一切的中心任务，其它工作可适当结合。”但是，还没有教给更多的具体办法，特别是对于棉田春灌、翻犁还没有充分注意，没有拟出有效的措施，去弥补过去放松领导春季生产所造成的损失。
