(Editor's Note: Many readers continue to write, criticizing the lack of attention to forestry work in some areas, pointing out that indiscriminate logging and hill burning incidents continue to occur. This must be given our full attention. We suggest that local governments continue to deepen forestry education among the masses, establish and consolidate mass forestry organizations, and promptly stop the phenomenon of forest destruction. Typical events must be seriously handled to educate the general public.)

Readers Continue to Expose Forest Destruction

Zhejiang, Xiangshan County, Shipu District, Jinxing Township

The Phenomenon of Forest Destruction is Very Serious

Xia Xuexiang, Wu Zuozeng, and Yang Meibao write: The phenomenon of forest destruction in Jinxing Township, Shipu District, Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province is serious. Since last winter, many farmers have been going up the mountains to cut down trees. Wang Asheng's bamboo mountain in Gaokeng has now been completely cut down. Wang Zhenmao planted 500 tung trees, 300 of which survived, but now some have been trampled to death by cattle, and some have been cut down for firewood, leaving only three. Cai Xiaoyou's mutual aid group in Fifth Village cut 30,000 catties of pine trees, totaling about 900 trees. The Township People's Government has ignored this serious phenomenon. On February 1 this year, township cadre Cai Meiying even approved Jin Quan'gen of Fifth Village to cut 15,000 catties of pine wood, but Jin Quan'gen actually cut 30,000 catties. Farmers in Third Village went up the mountains to cut down trees without approval, and the Township People's Government did not care. When someone stole someone else's tree, and the tree owner asked the Township People's Government to deal with it, the township head did not care. Therefore, the farmers said: "If I don't cut it, others will cut it for nothing, I might as well cut it myself." We suggest that the Xiangshan County People's Government should quickly check this situation and correct it.

Hunan Province, Linxiang County People's Government

Burning Forest Incidents Should Be Prevented from Continuing

Reader Binhui writes: The situation of forest fires in Linxiang County, Hunan Province is very serious. In March this year, there were five consecutive hill burning incidents in one month, destroying more than 6,000 mu of forest and burning down about 180,000 large and small pine trees. The reasons for the fires are: some are due to landlords' conspiracies to sabotage, and some are due to farmers being careless when burning mountain ridges and field ridges. It is recommended that the local People's Government strengthen education for the masses on fire prevention and forestry protection, and severely punish unlawful landlord elements who conspire to sabotage forests, in order to prevent the recurrence of forest burning incidents.

Yulin County People's Government Should Educate Farmers

Not to Cut Willow and Sand Sagebrush in Wushen Banner

Zhang Guozhen of the Suiyuan Provincial Forestry Bureau writes: Many areas of Wushen Banner in the Suiyuan Ik Zhao League are sandy grasslands. When the wind blows, yellow sand fills the sky, which is very harmful to agriculture and animal husbandry. In order to prevent wind and sand and protect pastures and livestock, local Mongolian herdsmen have established forestry protection organizations to strengthen the protection of natural sand willow, fog willow, and sand sagebrush, and collect sand sagebrush seeds in large quantities for planting year after year. However, a few farmers from Yulin County, Shaanxi Province, which is adjacent to the banner, often come to the banner to destroy these sand willow, fog willow, and sand sagebrush. The Forestry Protection Committee of the banner has repeatedly persuaded them to stop cutting down trees, but they not only do not accept the advice, but also say: "The People's Government calls on us to apply more fertilizer, so we cut it back to make compost!" This not only causes losses to the production of local herdsmen and nearby farmers, but also causes disunity between the Mongolian and Han people in the two places. It is recommended that the Yulin County People's Government quickly take effective measures to educate the county's farmers not to cut sand willow and sand sagebrush in Wushen Banner.

### 读者继续揭发破坏林木现象

专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：许多读者继续来信对某些地区不重视护林工作提出批评，指出各地任意砍伐林木和烧山事件仍然不断发生。这是必须引起我们十分重视的。我们建议各地政府继续深入群众加强护林教育，建立和整顿群众性的护林组织，对破坏林木的现象必须迅速制止，并抓住典型事件严肃处理，以教育一般群众。
    读者继续揭发破坏林木现象
    浙江象山县石浦区金星乡
    破坏林木的现象十分严重
    夏学祥、吴祚增、杨梅葆来信：浙江象山县石浦区金星乡破坏森林现象严重。自去年入冬以来，很多农民上山砍树。王阿生高坑的竹山，现在已被砍光。王振茂种五百株桐子，活了三百株，现在有的被牛踏死，有的被砍去当柴烧，只剩下三株。五村蔡小有互助组砍了三万斤松树，计九百株左右。而该乡人民政府对这一严重现象置之不理。今年二月一号乡干部蔡梅英还批准了五村金全根砍一万五千斤松木，而金全根实际上竟砍了三万斤。三村农民没有经过批准就上山砍树，乡人民政府也不管不问。有人偷砍了别人的树，树主请乡人民政府处理，乡长也不管。因此农民说：“自己不砍白白的被别人砍去，还是自己砍了好。”我们建议象山县人民政府应该迅速检查这一情况，并加以纠正。湖南省临湘县人民政府
    应防止烧林事件继续发生
    读者斌辉来信：湖南省临湘县森林着火的情况很严重，今年三月份一个月中就连续发生五次烧山事件，焚毁森林面积六千多亩、烧掉大小松树约十八万株。发生火灾的原因：有的是地主阴谋破坏，有的是农民烧山坎、田坎时不慎。建议当地人民政府加强对群众进行防火护林的教育，并对阴谋破坏森林的不法地主分子严厉惩办，以防止烧林事件继续发生。榆林县人民政府应教育农民
    不要到乌审旗砍伐柳木沙蒿
    绥远省林业局张国珍来信：绥远伊克昭盟乌审旗不少地区是明沙草地。大风一起，黄沙弥漫，对农牧业危害十分严重。当地蒙族牧民为了防止风沙，保护牧场、牲畜，就建立了护林组织，对天然沙柳、雾柳和沙蒿加强保护，并连年采集沙蒿籽种大量播种。但与该旗邻近的陕西榆林县有少数农民却经常到该旗破坏这些沙柳、雾柳和沙蒿。该旗护林委员曾几次说服他们停止砍伐林木，他们不但不接受意见，反而说：“人民政府号召我们多上肥料，我们砍回去好沤粪呀！”这不但使当地牧民和附近农民生产受损失，并且也会引起两地蒙汉人民的不团结。建议榆林县人民政府迅速采取有效措施，教育该县农民不再到乌审旗砍伐沙柳、沙蒿。
