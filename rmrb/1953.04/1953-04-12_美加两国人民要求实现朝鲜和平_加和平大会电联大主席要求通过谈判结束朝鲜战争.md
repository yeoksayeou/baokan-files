Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The American people are widely demanding the acceptance of the Sino-Korean side's new proposals for Korean armistice negotiations in order to achieve peace in Korea. Local 347 of the United Packinghouse Workers of America has called on its members to demand that the Eisenhower administration take full advantage of the new opportunity for peace offered by the Sino-Korean proposals to achieve peace. A special edition of the union newspaper distributed among workers at the Chicago stockyards said, "Let us watch our politicians and not allow them to sell us out for the profits of big business."

The New York May Day Provisional Committee issued a statement welcoming the Sino-Korean peace proposals and calling on all people to participate in the May Day parade to express their desire to stop the Korean War and end the Cold War. The statement urged the implementation of a peace economy and trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The statement said, "There will be jobs for everyone only by manufacturing consumer goods instead of war materials, and only by trading with hundreds of millions of people in the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries."

Thirty-eight men and women representing nine cities in Connecticut visited representatives attending the United Nations to urge UN representatives to step up their efforts to bring about a Korean armistice now that peace is newly possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th April: The "Canadian Tribune" reported on April 6: Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labour Progressive Party, said on March 31: "The Canadian government should take immediate action to accept the new proposals of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to speed up the armistice in Korea and bring Canadian troops back."

He said: "Any haggling over this new and clear proposal, as American reactionaries are already doing, should be condemned and seen as an attempt to continue the Korean War for the benefit of those war profiteers who are drawing huge profits from the blood of the people. The Canadian people condemn the Korean War. The Canadian government and Pearson, the current President of the United Nations General Assembly, must listen to the demands of the people."

Buck demanded that the Canadian government immediately request a special session of the United Nations General Assembly and propose at the meeting that the Chinese people's proposals be accepted.

Buck added: "Peace in Korea will help world peace and will be of great benefit to preventing world war." He said that the Labour Progressive Party has nominated many candidates for members of the House of Commons to participate in the federal elections this year. All of these candidates are advocating "action on the new and hopeful proposals of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" to immediately achieve peace in Korea.

A recent policy statement issued by the Canadian Peace Congress stated that the Canadian Peace Congress has telegraphed Pearson, President of the United Nations General Assembly, requesting an immediate ceasefire in Korea to show the sincerity of both sides, believing that this will "make a decisive contribution to the success of the final negotiations." The statement pointed out: "There is now an excellent opportunity to end this terrible war through negotiations, thereby opening the way for the five major powers to resolve all world disputes through negotiations." The statement calls on all public representatives and organizations and all Canadian people to unanimously support this ceasefire request.

    美加两国人民要求实现朝鲜和平 
    加和平大会电联大主席要求通过谈判结束朝鲜战争
    据新华社讯：美国人民纷纷要求接受中朝方面关于朝鲜停战谈判的新建议，以实现朝鲜的和平。产联屠宰工人工会芝加哥第三百四十七分会号召它的会员们要求艾森豪威尔政府充分利用中朝方面提出和平建议的新机会来实现和平。该分会在芝加哥牲畜场工作的工人当中发行的工会报纸的特刊说：“让我们监督我们的政客，不许他们因为大企业的利润而出卖我们。”
    纽约纪念五一节临时委员会发表声明，欢迎中朝方面的和平建议，并号召全体人民参加五一游行，表示他们要求停止朝鲜战争和结束冷战的愿望。声明敦促实行和平经济并与苏联及人民民主国家进行贸易。声明说：“只有制造消费品而不是制造战争物资，只有与苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家数亿人民进行贸易，大家才会有工作。”
    康涅狄格州代表九个城市的三十八位男女曾访问出席联合国的代表，要求联合国的代表们在和平有了新的可能的情况下加紧努力，以促成朝鲜停战。
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】“加拿大论坛报”四月六日消息：劳工进步党总书记蒂姆·布克三月三十一日说：“加拿大政府应当立刻采取行动，接受人民中国总理周恩来的新建议以便加速在朝鲜停战，并把加拿大军队调回来。”
    他说：“对这个新的和明确的建议所采取的任何讨价还价的行为，像美国反动分子已经在作的，都应当受到谴责，应当看作是企图继续朝鲜战争以利那些战争暴利者从人民血液中吸取巨大利润。加拿大人民谴责朝鲜战争。加拿大政府和现任联合国大会主席的皮尔逊必须听从人民的要求。”
    布克要求加拿大政府立即要求联合国大会举行特别会议，并在会议上提议接受中国人民的建议。
    布克又说：“朝鲜和平将有助于世界和平并对防止世界大战大有好处。”他说，劳工进步党已经提出了许多众议院议员候选人参加今年联邦选举。所有这些候选人都在主张“对中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的新的和有希望的建议采取行动”，来立刻实现朝鲜和平。
    加拿大和平大会最近发表的政策声明说：加拿大和平大会已经打电报给联合国大会主席皮尔逊，要求在朝鲜立即停火以表示双方诚意，认为这将“会对最后谈判的成功有决定性的贡献”。这个声明指出：“现在有极好的机会来通过谈判结束这个可怕的战争，从而为五大国以谈判方式解决世界所有纠纷打开道路。”声明要求所有公众代表与组织和所有加拿大人民一致支持这个停战的要求。
