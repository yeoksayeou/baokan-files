The first National Folk Music and Dance Festival, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on the 1st.

Three hundred and eight folk artists from the major administrative regions of North China, Northeast China, East China, Central South China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, representing ten ethnic groups including Han, Hui, Mongolian, Miao, Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Yi, Dong, and Korean, are participating in this festival. Some of them come from the remote desert areas of Xinjiang, some from the coast of East China, some from the mountainous areas of Southwest China, some from the grasslands of Mongolia, and some from Hainan Island in the South. The majority of them are working people who engage in artistic activities in their spare time. Among them are thirty-three veteran folk artists over the age of fifty. The oldest is seventy years old, and the youngest is only thirteen years old. They have brought eighty-six excellent folk art programs in sixty-two forms, including folk songs, mountain songs, folk instrumental performances, folk dances, and folk song and dance performances close to drama from various regions and ethnic groups.

On the opening ceremony on the 1st, more than 800 people, including folk artists of various ethnic groups wearing colorful ethnic costumes and literary and art workers from the central government and Beijing's art units, gathered together. The atmosphere of friendship, unity, and enthusiasm filled the venue.

At the opening ceremony, Tian Han, Director of the Arts Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, first extended a warm welcome to the artists of all ethnic groups who came to Beijing to participate in the festival.

Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the Central Government, spoke at the meeting, encouraging literary and art workers and folk artists to learn from each other to promote China's national music and dance. He said that only by promoting folk art can we meet the cultural needs of the broad masses of working people after the improvement of their political and economic life.

Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of Culture of the Central Government, said in his speech: Folk art is created by the working people to express their lives and wishes. Their art is always full of a healthy atmosphere and optimism. Now we want to use the method of mutual observation and learning to make our folk art more developed.

Ouyang Yuqian, President of the Central Academy of Drama, and Lao She, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, spoke at the meeting. They all praised the excellence and richness of China's folk art with great enthusiasm and hoped that literary and art workers would learn from folk art.

Representatives of folk artists from various regions who came to Beijing to participate in the festival also spoke at the meeting. The first speaker was Han Qixiang, a famous folk artist from northern Shaanxi, representing the Northwest region. He said: Today, I, a blind man, have truly opened my eyes. Although I can't see everyone, I can hear everyone's music and everyone's voices, and I feel happy. I must learn from everyone, improve my skills, and sing better for the working people. Following him were Wen Taifeng, a Korean artist from the Northeast region, Zhou Yuexian, an artist from the East China region, Seraxi, a sixty-six-year-old veteran artist and master of the horse-head fiddle from the Inner Mongolia region, Gao Jinshuan from the North China region, Abudunaybi Manap, a Uyghur artist from Yili, Xinjiang in the Northwest region, and Li Xinying, a thirteen-year-old actor and young children's team member from the Central South region. They all expressed their infinite gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government with great excitement and expressed that they would humbly learn from the folk artists of all regions and ethnic groups and the literary and art workers of the capital so that China's folk art would be more brilliant.

At the opening ceremony, the All-China Musicians Association and the All-China Dancers Association presented flags to the conference to pay tribute. On the evening of the 1st, the performance of the conference began, with folk artists from North China performing "Land Yangko - Running Donkey," "Small Flower Opera," "Errentai," "Lion Dance," "Taiping Drum," and flute, pipe, and large drum solos, as well as folk instrumental ensembles and "Bayin Hui" programs.
