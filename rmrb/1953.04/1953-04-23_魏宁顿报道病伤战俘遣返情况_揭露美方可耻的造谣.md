Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: According to a report from Panmunjom on April 21st by Alan Weinington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," another twelve ecstatic British soldiers were among the POWs repatriated by the Korean-Chinese side on the 21st. But it is noteworthy that when they and other POWs emerged from the American side's registration tents, their faces were even heavier than when they went in. On the other side of the neutral zone, the American side handing over captured Chinese People's Volunteers was a heartbreaking scene. The batch of captured Chinese personnel handed over by the American side on the 21st appeared even weaker and more exhausted than the previous day. As they stepped out of the American ambulances, they took off their outer garments and threw them on the ground.

The American side is still playing its old tricks, trying to prevent the truth from being revealed. Today, their security officials prevented reporters from entering our side's area for receiving sick and wounded POWs from Korea and China, although the Korean-Chinese side was willing to let reporters in, and the reporters also wanted to go in. The American side certainly does not want Western reporters to see the "achievements" of their work on Geoje Island. On the other hand, they are telling blatant lies about the health of British POWs in order to prevent them from meeting with reporters.

According to Reuters, yesterday a squad leader from the Gloucestershire Regiment named Leslie Manley was placed on a list of those unsuitable for meeting with reporters. Two other men from the Gloucestershire Regiment had spoken about receiving good treatment in North Korean POW camps and had both denied that the Korean-Chinese side had tried to "indoctrinate" them. Subsequently, the American side issued this statement. The Americans apparently consider soldiers from the Gloucestershire Regiment to be dangerous elements, so they prevented Manley from speaking. But I know that Manley can walk and talk perfectly well; he does not even need medical treatment. When he was captured, he injured his back, and this injury occasionally still causes him slight pain. He does not care about this injury, but according to the Korean-Chinese side's broad interpretation of "sick and wounded" POWs, the Korean-Chinese side still repatriated him, just as they repatriated many other almost healthy people. This is how the Americans are preventing British reporters from talking to the repatriated British POWs, for fear that the truth will be revealed.

### 魏宁顿报道病伤战俘遣返情况  揭露美方可耻的造谣

    魏宁顿报道病伤战俘遣返情况
    揭露美方可耻的造谣
        【新华社二十二日讯】据伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十一日自板门店报道，朝中方面二十一日遣返的战俘中又有十二个欢天喜地的英国人。但令人注意的是：当他们和其他战俘走出美方的登记帐篷时，他们的脸色就比他们走进去的时候更加沉重。在中立区的另一边，美方交出中国志愿军被俘人员，那是一幅令人伤心的情景。二十一日美方交来的一批中国被俘人员，看样子比前一天的还要衰弱，还要枯疲。他们在走出美国救护车的时候，脱掉外衣，把它们扔到地下。
    美方还是玩弄它的老一套把戏，想阻止真相透露出来。今天他们的治安官员们不让记者进入我方接受朝中病伤战俘的地区，虽然朝中方面是愿意让记者进去的，而记者们也希望进去。美方当然不希望西方记者看见他们在巨济岛上工作的“成绩”。另一方面，他们对于英国战俘的健康情况却大撒其谎，以便阻止他们和记者会面。
    据路透社消息，昨天有一个格罗斯?团的班长名叫莱斯利·曼莱的，被列入不宜于会见记者的名单里。另两个格罗斯?团的人曾谈到他们在北朝鲜战俘营中受到良好的待遇，并且都否认朝中方面曾努力给他们“灌输思想”，随后，美方就来了这一个声明。美国人显然认为格罗斯?团的士兵都是危险分子，于是不让曼莱开口。但是我知道曼莱完全可以走路和谈话，他甚至不需要医疗。当他被俘的时候，他的背部受了伤，这个伤处偶然还使他稍感痛苦。他对于这个伤处毫不在乎，但是根据朝中方面对于“病伤”战俘的广义的解释，朝中方面还是把他遣返，也像他们把许多别的几乎是健康的人都一律遣返一样。美国人就是这样不让英国记者去和遣返的英国战俘谈话，因为惟恐透露了真相。
