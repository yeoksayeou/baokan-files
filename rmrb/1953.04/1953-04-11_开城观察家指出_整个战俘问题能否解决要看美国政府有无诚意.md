Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th: Our special correspondent reports: At the liaison officers meeting held between both sides on the 10th, a complete agreement has been reached on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war in Panmunjom. General Li Sang-cho, head of the Korean-Chinese side's liaison group, suggested that the agreement be signed on the 11th. This suggestion was made to Rear Admiral Daniel, head of the US side's liaison group, through the interpreters after they checked the full text of the agreement to be signed on the afternoon of the 10th.

Daniel agreed that the agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war should be signed on the 11th.

The repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war can begin no later than ten days after the signing of the agreement. The agreement will terminate twenty days after the repatriation begins. The formal agreement will be written in Korean, Chinese, and English, and both sides will sign six final versions.

At the liaison officers meeting, the Korean-Chinese side handed over an important letter from General Nam Il to Mr. Harrison, the chief representative of the US side. This letter explained the Korean-Chinese side's new proposal in principle. This marks another step taken by the Korean-Chinese side to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue and achieve a ceasefire in Korea after reaching an agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war.

The letter explains the new proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The letter said that the repatriation of prisoners of war should be carried out in two steps: namely, "The negotiating parties should guarantee the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war in their custody who insist on repatriation after the armistice, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries to ensure a fair solution to their repatriation issue."

This concession in terms of the steps, time, and method of repatriating prisoners of war has made it possible to completely resolve the entire prisoner of war issue, which is the only remaining obstacle to a ceasefire in Korea. However, observers here point out that both sides must make concessions to achieve a peaceful resolution. It now depends on whether the US government is sincere in immediately resuming the armistice negotiations and completely resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, so as to achieve a ceasefire in Korea as soon as possible.

General Li Sang-cho today presented the further classification figures of approximately 600 sick and wounded Korean and non-Korean prisoners of war to be repatriated in Panmunjom. Among them, there are approximately 120 Americans, 20 Britons, and 15 prisoners of war of other nationalities, including Turkish, Canadian, Greek, and Dutch. General Li Sang-cho said that the classification figures for prisoners of war of other nationalities will be provided immediately after verification.

Daniel proposed adjourning the meeting until the 11th to prepare for signing the agreement. The liaison officers meeting will continue at 11:00 a.m. on the 11th.

### 开城观察家指出  整个战俘问题能否解决要看美国政府有无诚意

    开城观察家指出
    整个战俘问题能否解决要看美国政府有无诚意
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者报道：在十日举行的双方联络组会议上，双方已就在板门店交换病伤战俘问题取得完全协议。朝中方面联络组组长李相朝将军建议协定在十一日签字。这个建议是在翻译人员十日下午核对了有待签字的协定全文以后，通过他们向美方联络组组长丹尼尔海军少将提出的。
    丹尼尔同意关于遣返病伤战俘的协定在十一日签字。
    病伤战俘的遣返可在不迟于协定签字后十天内开始。协定将在遣返开始后二十天终止。正式协定将用朝鲜文、中文和英文书写，双方将在六份定稿上签字。
    在联络组会议上，朝中方面交出南日大将给美方首席代表哈利逊的一封重要的信，这封信对朝中方面的新建议作了原则的说明。这标志着朝中方面为了在就遣返病伤战俘问题取得协议以后解决整个遣返战俘问题和实现朝鲜停战而采取的又一个步骤。
    这封信说明了中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的新建议，这封信说，战俘的遣返应当分两步进行。即：“谈判双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。”
    在遣返战俘的步骤、时间和方法方面所作的这种让步，已使得整个战俘问题的完全解决成为可能，这个问题是妨碍朝鲜停战的唯一仅存的障碍。但是此间观察家们指出，双方必须互相让步，才能获得和平解决，现在要看美国政府有没有诚意立即恢复停战谈判和完全解决战俘遣返问题，以便早日实现朝鲜的停战。
    李相朝将军今天提出了将在板门店被遣返的约六百名病伤朝鲜战俘和非朝鲜战俘的进一步分类的数字。其中约有一百二十名美国人、二十名英国人和十五名包括土耳其、加拿大、希腊和荷兰等国籍在内的其他国籍的战俘。李相朝将军说，其他国籍战俘的分类数字，将在核对完毕后立即提出。
    丹尼尔提议休会到十一日再开，以便准备签订协定。联络组会议将在十一日上午十一时继续举行。
