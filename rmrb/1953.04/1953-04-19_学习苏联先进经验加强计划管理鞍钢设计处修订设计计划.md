    [This dispatch from our correspondent An Gang, in Anshan] The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Design Institute, under the direct guidance of Soviet experts, mobilized the masses to revise the 1953 design plan. This not only made the plan more realistic and saved 65,000 workdays but also ensured the timely completion of design tasks, laying a solid foundation for plan management.
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Design Institute had compiled a design plan in 1952. However, due to a lack of experience in formulating plans and a lack of planning quota data, each plan was developed subjectively by the comprehensive team and individual engineering design leaders. As a result, most of the plans could not be completed on schedule. This year, the Design Institute's design plan was prepared in January according to the seven forms proposed by Soviet experts. More scientific methods were used in the method of formulating the plan and the calculation of workload. However, in this planning process, there was insufficient education of the masses and a lack of thorough investigation and research by the leadership, so many plans were conservatively drafted. Some unnecessary work was included in the plan, while some that should have been included were omitted. To address this, the institute criticized erroneous design thinking in February and, based on suggestions from Soviet experts, conducted a mass revision of the plan.
    In this revision, the institute first criticized the conservative thinking in the planning process and then carefully calculated to establish more advanced quotas. It stipulated that each person work an average of 24 days per month, with an annual operating rate of 94 percent. In terms of design standards, it divided designs into different categories according to advanced Soviet methods. Based on the current technical level of the designers, it tentatively set a target of eight drawings per person per month and used this method to calculate the workload. On this basis, the Design Institute mobilized the masses for extensive discussions. Many engineering designs had previously overestimated the labor required, and the masses took the initiative to reduce it. For example, the Metallurgical Equipment Section originally planned to design 15,000 drawings and 47,000 workdays for the whole year, but after revision, it was changed to 8,000 drawings and 24,000 workdays. The Steelmaking Section originally planned 3,811 drawings and 11,433 workdays, but now it has been changed to 1,296 drawings and 3,888 workdays. Many items that did not need to be included in the plan were also cut, such as removing the "Overseas Design Technical Supervision" item from the original plan (this year, the company has established a Technical Supervision Department to be responsible for comprehensive project inspection and acceptance, and Soviet experts are providing construction technical guidance for major projects, making "Overseas Design Technical Supervision" unnecessary), saving 30,000 workdays. In addition, some overlooked projects were also included in the plan. The revised plan basically met the actual situation and saved more than 65,000 workdays (equivalent to the annual workload of 212 technical personnel).
    It is particularly worth mentioning that the institute, during the revision of the plan, arranged the design sequence according to the importance and urgency of the projects. This ensures the timely completion of the design tasks for major projects in cases where the design force is insufficient, while also appropriately considering minor projects.
    During this revision of the design plan, close contact was not made with relevant units such as planning and construction, and the various departments failed to reach a consensus on determining the major and minor design projects and the time for delivering the drawings. In the arrangement of design projects, there was also a lack of comprehensive consideration based on the engineering system. As a result, a major project was included in the major projects for design, while the projects that supported it were relegated to minor projects. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company convened a meeting on March 26 to review the revised design plan and decided that a review team should be established jointly by the design, planning, engineering management, and equipment departments to resolve the problems in the design plan.

### 学习苏联先进经验加强计划管理鞍钢设计处修订设计计划

    学习苏联先进经验加强计划管理鞍钢设计处修订设计计划
    【本报讯】本报驻鞍山记者安岗报道：鞍山钢铁公司设计处在苏联专家直接指导下，发动群众修订一九五三年设计计划，不但使计划切合实际，节省了六万五千个工日，并可保证按时完成设计任务，打下了计划管理的良好基础。
    鞍钢设计处在一九五二年曾编制过设计计划，但由于缺乏制订计划的经验和计划定额资料，每次计划都是由综合组和个别工程设计负责人凭主观想像制订的，所以计划大部不能按期完成。今年设计处的设计计划是在一月份根据苏联专家提出的七种表格进行编制的，在订计划的方法和工作量的计算上，都采用了比较科学的方法。但在这次制订计划中，由于对群众教育不够和领导上缺乏周密的调查研究，因而有不少的计划订得保守。有些不必要的工作也列入了计划，有些应列入的反被遗漏。为此该处又在二月份批判错误设计思想之后，根据苏联专家建议，进行了群众性的修订计划工作。
    在这次修订计划中，该处首先批判了订计划中的保守思想，接着就精打细算，订出比较先进的定额。规定每人平均每月工作二十四日，全年作业率为百分之九十四。在设计标准上按苏联先进方法分出不同的设计类别，根据目前设计人员的技术水准暂定每月每人设计八张图纸，并以此办法来计算工作量。在这一基础上，设计处发动群众广泛的讨论。许多工程设计过去估工太多，群众就主动地削减。如冶金设备科原计划全年的设计任务为一万五千张图纸，四万七千个工日，修正后改为八千张图纸，两万四千个工日。炼钢科原计划三千八百一十一张图纸，一万一千四百三十三个工日，现改为一千二百九十六张图纸，三千八百八十八个工日。许多不必列入计划的也被削掉了，如把第一次计划中的“国外设计技术监工”一项削掉（今年公司已成立技术监督处负责全面工程检查和验收工作，各主要工程并有苏联专家作施工技术指导，“国外设计技术监工”已没有必要），节省了三万个工日。此外，有些被遗漏的项目也都订入计划。这样修订过的计划，基本上符合了实际情况，并节省了六万五千多工日（相当于二百一十二个技术人员全年的工作量）。
    特别值得提出的是，该处在修订计划中根据工程的轻重缓急排列了设计次序。这样既可在设计力量不足的情况下，保证按时完成主要工程的设计任务，又可适当地照顾次要工程。
    在这次修订设计计划中，没有和计划、施工等有关单位取得密切联系，在确定主要和次要设计项目及交付图纸的时间上，各部门未能取得一致意见。在设计项目的安排上，也没按照工程系统全面考虑，因之某一主要工程列入主要项目进行设计了，而配合它的工程却被排到次要项目。鞍山钢铁公司已于三月二十六日召开了会议，审查这次修正的设计计划；并决定由设计、计划、工程管理、设备等处共同成立审核组，解决设计计划中的问题。
