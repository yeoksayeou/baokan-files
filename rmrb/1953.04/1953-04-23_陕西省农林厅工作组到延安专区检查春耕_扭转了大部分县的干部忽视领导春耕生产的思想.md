The cadres in most counties of the Yan'an Special District, Shaanxi Province, were not very enthusiastic about leading spring agricultural production. After inspection and assistance from the working group led by Xie Huaide, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, this situation has been basically reversed.

Director Xie Huaide and his working group arrived in Yan'an on March 28th. They inspected Liulin Village and the farm and ranch in Yan'an, and convened relevant units to listen to reports. After inspection, it was found that the counties generally did not attach great importance to leading spring agricultural production. Many problems in farmers' production have not been resolved. There are signs of drought in northern Shaanxi, but leaders at all levels have not been alerted to the threat of drought. The drought prevention and control committees and offices of various counties and the special district have been virtually cancelled. Cadres believe that it was said to be a drought last year but it didn't happen, so it may not happen this year either. The masses have the mentality of "if people are busy but the heavens are not, there will eventually be a disaster," so they are not very enthusiastic about drought prevention work. Some counties are blindly carrying out drought prevention and control work. For example, Ganquan County originally planned to build 1,600 mu of paddy fields, but construction was stopped after it started because the specific situation was not grasped. Fu County planned to build terraced fields, but has not started construction to this day. There are also phenomena of forced orders to allocate the construction of terraced fields in other places. Generally, cadres and the masses simply believe that digging wells and building canals can prevent drought, while ignoring methods such as digging embankments, building terraced fields, and harrowing to prevent drought and preserve soil moisture. Regarding the spring famine problem, except for counties such as Luochuan, where the spring famine is more serious due to hail disasters last year, although there are food-deficient households in other places, it is not serious. Currently, there are two ideas among the leading cadres in various counties regarding this issue: one is to exaggerate the spring famine, saying that the spring famine is serious when only a few farmers are short of food; the other is complacency, believing that the food shortage is not serious and it doesn't matter, and not taking active measures to solve it. In general, there is insufficient understanding of the situation.

Due to the lack of specific leadership, there are many problems in the agricultural production cooperatives in various counties, which cannot be resolved in a timely manner. Many cooperatives have unreasonable share dividends, unsound systems, and excessive public accumulation funds.

Labor models hold too many concurrent positions, which affects production. Lu Zongming and Xiao Lianhai in Huangling County each hold nine positions concurrently. Li Youhua in Yan'an holds thirteen positions concurrently. Last year, the meeting time totaled three months and two days, which had a great impact on production and caused dissatisfaction in the family and team.

Based on the above situation, Director Xie Huaide pointed out: In order to make spring agricultural production truly become the overriding central task in rural areas, cadres in general should not be transferred after the summing up and implementation of the Marriage Law movement in various counties. Leading cadres of the special district should go to various counties for key inspections to discover and solve problems at any time. We should immediately focus on drought prevention and control, restore the original production and drought prevention offices, and seize the time to carry out canal digging, well digging, and basic land construction, such as building terraced fields and dams; we must attach importance to finding various methods for drought prevention and control in mountainous areas, and cannot completely rely on building canals and digging wells. Educate farmers to pay attention to intensive farming, harrowing to preserve soil moisture and prevent drought, check soil moisture at any time, and regard sowing early autumn crops and protecting wheat seedlings as the most important tasks at present. Currently, the construction of terraced fields must start with key points, with special personnel to guide them. We should first build those that require less labor and are easy to see benefits. Those that require too much labor can be built gradually over the years. We must correct the idea of not paying attention to water conservancy construction and the practice of forced orders. Regarding agricultural production cooperatives, we should immediately correct the practice of counties abandoning leadership and districts and townships blindly engaging in it. Regarding labor models, the urgent need is to solve the problem of too many concurrent positions. Leading cadres of the county party and government should personally assist in solving it. General labor models should not hold more than three concurrent positions, so that they have sufficient time to do a good job in production.

    陕西省农林厅工作组到延安专区检查春耕
    扭转了大部分县的干部忽视领导春耕生产的思想
    陕西省延安专区大部分县的干部领导春耕生产的劲头不大；经陕西省农林厅谢怀德厅长率领的工作组检查、帮助以后，这种情况已经基本上扭转了。
    谢怀德厅长及其所率领的工作组于三月二十八日到达延安。在延安检查了柳林村和延安的农场和牧场，并召集有关单位听取汇报。经过检查，发现各县对领导春耕生产大都很不重视。农民生产中的许多问题并未解决。目前陕北各地已有旱象，但各级领导对旱灾的威胁，仍未引起警惕。各县及专区防旱抗旱委员会和办公室已无形取消，干部认为去年说旱并未旱，今年也未必旱。群众存着“人忙天不忙，终究有一场”的靠天吃饭思想，因而对防旱工作劲头不大。有些县在防旱抗旱工作上，带有盲目性。如甘泉县原计划修水田一千六百亩，因没有掌握具体情况，动工后又停修。鄜县计划修梯田，至今未动工。其他地方也有强迫命令摊修梯田的现象。一般干部和群众单纯地认为打井修渠才能防旱，而忽视挖埝、修梯田以及耙耱防旱保墒办法。关于春荒问题，除洛川等县由于去年受雹灾春荒较严重外，其余各地虽然都有缺粮户，但并不严重。目前各县领导干部对此问题，存在两种思想：一种是夸大春荒，本来只有少数农户缺粮，干部却夸大说春荒严重；另一种是麻痹思想，认为缺粮不严重，没有关系，不采取积极办法解决。总的来说是对情况掌握不够。
    各县的农业生产合作社，由于缺乏具体领导，存在许多问题，不能及时得到解决，很多社入股分红不合理，制度不健全，公积金过多。
    劳动模范兼职过多，影响生产。黄陵县鲁宗明、萧连海各兼九职。延安李有华兼十三职，去年开会时间共达三个月零两天，对生产影响很大，引起家庭和组内不满。
    根据以上情况，谢怀德厅长指出：为使各县把春耕生产真正变为农村中压倒一切的中心工作，各县在总结贯彻婚姻法运动之后，一般干部不应调动。专区领导干部应到各县作重点检查，随时发现和解决问题。应该立刻以防旱抗旱为中心，恢复原有的生产防旱办公室，抓紧进行修渠打井及土地基本建设，如修梯田、打坝堰等；必须重视寻找山区防旱抗旱的各种办法，不能完全依靠修渠打井。教育农民注意精耕细作耙耱保墒防旱，随时查验墒土，并以播早秋、保麦苗为当前最重要的工作。目前修梯田必须先由重点做起，得有专人指导，先修用工少的、易见利的，花工太大的可用逐年修成的办法，必须纠正不重视兴修水利的思想和强迫命令的作法。关于农业生产合作社，应立即纠正县放弃领导，由区乡盲目乱搞的作法。关于劳动模范，目前急需解决兼职过多问题，应由各县党政领导干部亲自协助解决，一般劳动模范兼职不应超过三职，使他们有充分时间搞好生产。
