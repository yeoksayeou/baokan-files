Reader's Letters Abstract

    An Article in "Happiness Brought by the Marriage Law" Should Be Removed
    Li Ming of the Propaganda Department of the Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province writes: The book "Happiness Brought by the Marriage Law," edited by the Propaganda Group of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council and published by the People's Publishing House, has excellent content and is of great educational significance to the masses. However, the inclusion of the article "It is Better for Children to Make Their Own Decisions on Marriage" written by Comrade Wang Denggui is inappropriate. After the article was published in the Shanxi Daily, readers exposed that its content was entirely fabricated; the author Wang Denggui also made a self-criticism. It is extremely inappropriate to select this entirely empty, false report and include it in "Happiness Brought by the Marriage Law" for everyone to promote. It is suggested that the editors and publishers of the book take remedial measures to avoid causing adverse effects.
    Reply from the Propaganda Group of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council
    The opinion raised in the letter from reader Li Ming forwarded by you is completely correct. The article "It is Better for Children to Make Their Own Decisions on Marriage" written by Wang Denggui, which is included in the book "Happiness Brought by the Marriage Law," was selected from the Shanxi Daily of September 4, 1952. After the book was printed, the Shanxi Daily exposed that the content of the article was entirely fabricated, and criticized the author's "empty" style; the author also made a self-criticism. After the book was printed, we failed to detect this problem in time and remove the article; this was due to our lack of thoroughness in our work, which we should pay attention to in the future. We have now notified the People's Publishing House to remove this article when the book is reprinted.

### “婚姻法带来的幸福”一书中有一篇文章应该取消

专栏：读者来信摘要

    “婚姻法带来的幸福”一书中有一篇文章应该取消
    中共山西省永济县委宣传部李明来信：政务院政治法律委员会宣传组编辑、人民出版社出版的“婚姻法带来的幸福”一书，内容很好，对群众教育意义很大。但其中选登了王登贵同志写的“婚姻大事还是让孩子们自己作主好”一文，是不好的。按该文在山西日报刊出后，读者就揭发其内容全系捏造；作者王登贵也作了检讨。把这篇全系客里空的假报道选登在“婚姻法带来的幸福”一书中让大家宣传，这是极不妥当的。建议该书编辑者和出版者设法补救，以免造成不良影响。
    政务院政法委员会宣传组的答复
    你报转来读者李明来信所提的意见是完全正确的。“婚姻法带来的幸福”一书中所载王登贵作
    “婚姻大事还是让孩子们自己作主好”一文系选自一九五二年九月四日山西日报。当该书付印后，山西日报揭发了该文内容全系捏造，即对作者这种
    “客里空”作风提出批评；作者并做了检讨。在本书付印后，我们未能及早发觉这个问题，把该文取消；这是我们工作不够细密之故，今后应加注意。现在我们已经通知人民出版社在再版该书时取消这篇文章。
