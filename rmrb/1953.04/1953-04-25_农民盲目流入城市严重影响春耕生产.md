Readers of this newspaper continue to write letters reflecting the situation in various places where farmers are blindly flowing into cities, reducing the rural labor force, and seriously affecting spring ploughing production. Some excerpts from the letters are published below:

Reader Wang Han-san from Shanxi writes: Since March, every day dozens, sometimes over a hundred, farmers and demobilized soldiers have come to the Yuci Prefectural Office Labor Section asking for job referrals. However, the factories and mines are already fully staffed. These people are running back and forth between Yuci and Taiyuan. Many people spend all their travel expenses, sell their luggage, and come to the Prefectural Office. In the end, they can only be given some travel money to send them home. Many of these farmers were blindly introduced by county, district, and village governments. For example, among the forty-three farmers who came to Yuci from Hebei on March 12, fourteen had letters of introduction. Farmers Liu Bao-shan and others had letters of introduction from the Sixth District Government of Gaocheng County, Lu Tian-jun and others had letters of introduction from the Sixth District of Xingtai County, Zhao Wan-cai and others had letters of introduction from the Xingtai County Public Security Bureau, Yang Feng-cheng had a letter of introduction from the Nanzhao County Civil Affairs Section, and the remaining seven all had letters of introduction from the village government.

Reader Chen Bin from Shanxi Province writes: In Qidao Village, Sixth District of Lin County, there is a worker named Liu Si-yu who works in the Fujiatan Earth and Wood Construction Engineering Brigade in Lingshi County. He wrote twice to ask his father to organize farmers to work in Lingshi; after receiving the letter, his father organized twenty-eight farmers from nearby villages to the district government to get letters of introduction. The district government did not issue letters of introduction, but told them: "Go ahead, and after you find a job, send a letter, and we can give you a certificate." So these farmers came to Lingshi one after another. But the brigade simply didn't need anyone, and Liu Si-yu had to pay the farmers 100,000 yuan as a food allowance. The next day, they found the county government, which subsidized some travel expenses, and they were able to return home.

Readers Sun Xi-zheng and Rong Ren-kang from Jiangsu write: In the half-month from March 2 to March 16, in the Husan Village of Hushan Township, Wuxi City alone, four people were introduced to work in Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Qiqihar Machinery Industry Administration in the Northeast through personal connections. These four people are all rural youth, without any industrial skills. One of them, named Ji Hui-fen, is only seventeen years old this year and does not meet the age requirements for recruitment by Anshan Iron and Steel Company (at least eighteen years old). Currently, some rural youths are not content with agricultural production, and they mistakenly believe that farming is not promising, and they are trying to find connections to work in factories all day long. We believe that this phenomenon not only affects agricultural production, but also makes urban employment more difficult. The leadership must pay attention to prevent this.

The Labor Section of the Yixing County People's Government in Jiangsu Province writes: Recently, many people from Heqiao, Zhangzhu, Yicheng and other places in this county have gone to the Northeast to look for jobs. Nearly thirty people from Zhangzhu went to Jilin City, more than ten from Heqiao went to Anshan, and more than ten from Yicheng were about to go. At first, they applied to the government for certificates and letters of introduction, but now they go to the Northeast without any documents because some people from this county working in the Northeast have returned home and wrote letters saying, "There is a way to get by even without a certificate." For example, Nie Jin-sheng, who works at the Tiedong Youhao Street Cooperative in Anshan City, recently took leave to return to Heqiao. He told young people: "The Anshan City Labor Bureau often posts recruitment signs because state-owned enterprises are short of people. You can get by." Fan Xi-jin, who works for the Tiexi State-owned Joint Company in Anshan City, wrote to Sheng Suo-rong in Heqiao saying: "This place needs people. I have made arrangements, and no letter of introduction is needed." Therefore, Sheng Suo-rong went to the Northeast with only his Communist Youth League membership. Now, in addition to continuing to strengthen the education of rural youths, we also hope that when industrial and mining enterprises in various places increase their personnel, they must mobilize in a planned way through certain organizations and not recruit on their own. We must educate employees and not let them write letters in their own names and recruit people everywhere.

Reader Zuo Yue-feng from Hebei writes: Recently, I went to Li Laogongzhuang in Tong County to promote the Zhaoyuan increased production experience. The mutual aid group leaders generally do not want to accept it. One of the reasons is that many laborers have gone out, and they have no confidence in increasing production. According to statistics, out of the eighty laborers in the village, fifty have gone out. The village dug five brick wells last year. This year, the village cadres committed to digging two wells to the district, but no one has started yet.

Reader Li Wei-chun from Shanxi writes: Zhongshe Village in Yu County planned to build a dam this year, but work stopped after only three days because cadres and the masses do not pay attention to agricultural production and want to go out to work. Six young people from the village have gone to Taiyuan, and many more want to go.

Readers Deng Bing-zhong, Li De-xin, Shi Zi-long, and Li Shu-jing from Hebei write: Farmers in Huanghua County are generally blindly going out to work, especially in the first, third, fourth, and seventh districts. According to statistics from seven villages including Xi Cuizhuang and Guo Zhuang in the third district, there are a total of 769 laborers, and 552 have gone out, accounting for more than 70% of the total labor force. In a certain village, all ten militiamen handed their guns over to the village chief and all went out. According to statistics from 46 villages in the district, the main cadres of one-third of the villages have gone out to work, and nineteen villages are left with only clerks and village chiefs, who are not at ease in their work. No one is leading the current spring ploughing production. Out of 150 full-time literacy teachers in the county, 100 have requested to go out. The reason why village cadres go out is mostly because they see that many laborers in the village have gone out, the work is not easy to do, and they are afraid of being criticized by their superiors; they are also ridiculed at home. For example, Zhao Yong-long, a cadre in Zhong Zhao Village, could not get food when he went home. His family said, "Everyone else is going out to earn money, and you are the only one serving the people. Who will serve you?" Therefore, he also requested to go out. This is a very serious problem, and we hope that the leadership will pay close attention to it.

### 农民盲目流入城市严重影响春耕生产

    农民盲目流入城市严重影响春耕生产
    本报读者继续来信反映各地农民盲目流入城市，农村劳动力减少，严重影响了春耕生产的情况。现将来信一部摘要发表如下：
    山西读者王汉三来信：三月份以来，每天来榆次专署劳动科要求介绍工作的农民及转业军人，少则数十，多则百余。但各厂、矿工人早已满员。这些人就在榆次、太原两地来回乱碰。不少人花完路费，卖掉行李，找到专署，最后只得给些路费打发他们回家。这些农民有很多是由县、区、村政府盲目介绍出来的。如三月十二日从河北来到榆次的四十三名农民中，就有十四人带着介绍信。农民刘保山等二人带有藁城县六区区政府的介绍信，陆田俊等二人带有邢台县六区的介绍信，赵万才等二人带有邢台县公安局的介绍信，杨凤成带有南和县民政科的介绍信，其余七人都带有村政府的介绍信。
    山西省读者陈斌来信：临县六区岐道村有一个工人名叫刘思玉，在灵石县富家滩土木建筑工程大队工作。他曾两次写信叫他父亲组织农民到灵石工作；他父亲接信后就到附近各村组织了二十八名农民去区政府开介绍信，区政府没有开介绍信，但对他们说：“你们去吧，找妥工作后来个信，就可以给你们开证明。”于是这些农民便先后来到灵石。但该队根本就不用人，刘思玉只得付给农民十万元作为伙食补助费。第二天，他们找到县政府，县里补助一部分路费，他们才得回家。
    江苏读者孙希正、荣仁康来信：自三月二日至三月十六日的半个月中，单无锡市湖山乡的湖三村一地，就有四个人因私人关系被介绍到东北的鞍山钢铁公司、齐齐哈尔机械工业管理局去工作。这四个人都是农村青年，没有任何工业技术，其中有一个名叫季惠芬的，今年虚龄才十七岁，根本不合鞍山钢铁公司招收人员规定的年龄（起码十八岁）。现在部分农村青年不安心农业生产，他们错误地认为种田没出息，整日地找关系想到工厂去工作。我们认为这种现象非但影响农业生产，还会使城市就业工作增加困难，领导上必须注意防止。
    江苏省宜兴县人民政府劳动科来信：近日来，本县和桥、张渚、宜城等地有很多人到东北去找职业，张渚有近三十人去吉林市，和桥有十多人去鞍山，宜城尚有十多人要去。他们起初还向政府申请发给证明书和介绍信，现在便不要证件就到东北去了，原因是有些在东北工作的本县人回家和来信都说“没有证明书也有办法”。如在鞍山市铁东友好街合作社工作的聂金生，最近请假回和桥，他对青年人说：“鞍山市劳动局因国营企业缺少人，时常挂出招聘的牌子，你们去是有办法的。”在鞍山市铁西国营联营公司工作的范锡金，给和桥盛锁荣来信说：“此地要人，我已接洽好，勿需什么介绍信。”因此，盛锁荣没有带介绍信，只带上团员关系就到东北去了。现在我们除继续加强对农村青年的教育工作外，也希望各地工矿、企业增加人员时必须有计划地通过一定组织去动员，不要自行招聘。对职工要进行教育，不要让他们以私人名义随便写信四处乱拉。
    河北读者左月风来信：最近我到通县李老公庄去推广肇源增产经验，互助组长一般都不愿接受，原因之一就是劳动力外出很多，增产无信心。据统计：该村八十个劳动力已有五十名外出。该村去年打砖井五眼，今年村干部在区里自认两眼，但到现在还没一户动手。
    山西读者李维春来信：盂县中社村今年计划打一道坝，只做三天便停了工，原因是干部和群众都不重视农业生产，想外出做工。村里已有六个青年去太原，现在还有很多想去。
    河北读者邓秉忠、李德馨、史子龙、李述菁来信：黄骅县农民普遍盲目外出，较严重的是一、三、四、七等区。据三区西崔庄、郭庄等七个村统计：共有劳动力七百六十九人，已外出的有五百五十二人，占劳动力总数百分之七十多。某村共十个民兵，都把枪交给村长，全部外出。据全区四十六村的统计：三分之一的村庄的主要干部都外出作工，有十九个村子只剩下文书和村长，还不安心工作，当前的春耕生产没人领导。全县一百五十个专职扫除文盲教师有一百个要求外出。村干部外出的原因，多数是看到村里劳动力外出很多，工作不大好做，怕挨上级批评；回家又受家里挖苦。如中赵村干部赵永隆回家吃不到饭，家里人说：“人家都出去挣钱，就你为人民服务，谁为你服务呢？”因而也要求外出。这是很严重的问题，望领导上很好地注意。
