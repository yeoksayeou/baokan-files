    Tianjin Machine Casting Industry Workers
    Actively Process and Support Basic Construction
    The workers of over ninety factories in Tianjin's machine casting industry are enthusiastically accepting the task of processing machine parts for basic construction, supporting the country's large-scale economic construction.

    The Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry entrusted the Tianjin machine casting industry with processing a batch of basic construction machine parts, the quantity of which is equivalent to half a year's production for the contracting factories. After the processing agreement was formally signed in early February, the workers in each factory, knowing that these processed machine parts were to support the country's basic construction, were exceptionally enthusiastic. The workers at Heji Iron Factory said, "We finally have the chance to serve large-scale economic construction." At the Tianjin Municipal Metal Industry Workers' Representative Conference, the workers of Tianxing Rongji Machine Factory challenged the workers of other factories, proposing: Guarantee that the product specifications and quality meet the standards of the drawings, guarantee the early completion of the task, and supervise the capitalist to ensure that materials are used for their designated purpose. The workers of each factory responded enthusiastically. As of the March 20th inspection, Tianxing Rongji Machine Factory had already achieved the above three guarantees. The workers in the workshops of factories such as Yidong, Yixing, Xinxing, and Yansheng also challenged each other. After seeing the raw materials brought by the capitalist for processing, the workers of factories such as Zhongda, Zhiyou, and Sanyi Yong immediately posted big-character posters, proposing to support the country's economic construction and guarantee the completion of the processing task. The welding of drill bits at the Sentai and Xinbeihua factories initially had pinholes, but after the workers studied and improved the operation methods, they quickly overcame this shortcoming.

    In order to effectively organize private enterprises to complete the processing tasks for basic construction, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Trust Company, the Equipment Company, and representatives of the machine casting industry and the wrought iron industry formed a processing and ordering committee, with more than twenty full-time cadres responsible for handling all matters related to processing and ordering. The committee first conducted publicity and mobilization among the capitalists of each factory, explaining the significance of this processing and requiring each processing factory to guarantee the completion of the task on schedule. In order to prevent blind and chaotic phenomena in processing production, the committee specifically investigated the machinery and equipment and technical conditions of each factory, allocating precision machinery to factories with good equipment and technical conditions. Under the leadership of the processing and ordering committee and the trade association, each factory formed fourteen production groups, each group with a machine factory as the core, including wrought iron, cast iron, and wood mold factories. The processing agreement was signed by the machine factory, and other wrought iron, cast iron, and wood mold factories then signed contracts with the machine factory. Because the method of organizing was adopted, the production difficulties caused by the lack of machinery and equipment in private factories were overcome. When allocating tasks, the committee particularly emphasized the idea of relying on the masses to complete the tasks. It successively held symposiums with old workers from each factory to study in detail the problems that might be encountered in processing; it also hired technicians from each factory to further study the specific conditions of each factory and carefully estimate the work and materials to avoid losses to state property and to ensure that capitalists obtain reasonable profits.

    After the processing agreement was signed, the committee also printed the types of work pieces undertaken by each factory, specifications and quality, acceptance methods, packaging methods, and other materials into documents and distributed them to the grassroots trade unions of each contracting factory, so that workers would have a clear understanding and be able to supervise production. After the start of production, the processing and ordering committee also transferred more than ten technical cadres to form an inspection team to go to each factory to discover problems in order to solve them in a timely manner. For example, it was found that in addition to the Sentai and Xinbeihua factories, the welding in the other factories had pinholes. The inspection team immediately convened welding workers from all factories in the city to visit the welding workers' demonstrations at the Sentai and Xinbeihua factories to exchange experiences. Now the welding problem in each factory has been basically solved.

    After accepting this batch of processing machine parts, the capitalists of each factory have stated that they must complete the processing task well and support the country's economic construction.

    天津机器铸铁业职工
    积极加工支援基本建设
    天津市机器铸铁业九十余厂职工，热烈接受基本建设的机件加工任务，支援祖国大规模的经济建设。
    中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局委托天津机器铸铁业加工一批基本建设机件，其数量相当于承做厂半年的生产量。第一季度加工的机件有泥浆搅拌机、起重机等百种左右，加工协议于二月上旬正式签订后，各厂职工知道这批加工机件是为了支援祖国基本建设，情绪异常高涨。合记铁工厂的工人们说：“我们这次可摸到为大规模经济建设服务的机会了。”在全市五金业工人代表大会上，天星荣记机器厂的职工向各厂职工挑战，提出：保证产品规格质量合乎图纸的标准，保证提前完成任务，监督资方专料专用。各厂职工纷纷响应。至三月二十日检查，天星荣记机器厂已经实现上述三项保证。义东、义兴、新兴、延生等厂各车间的职工也相互挑战。中大、志有、三义永等厂职工看见资方领来加工的原料后，马上贴出大字报，提出支援祖国经济建设，保证完成加工任务。森泰、新北华两厂烧焊的钻粒钻头起初有砂眼，经职工研究改善了操作方法，很快地克服了这个缺点。
    为很好地组织私营企业完成基本建设的加工任务，天津市人民政府工商局、市总工会、信托公司、器材公司和机器铸铁业、锻铁业等代表组成了加工订货委员会，设有专职干部二十余人，负责办理加工订货中的一切事项。委员会先向各厂资方进行了宣传动员，说明此次加工的意义，要求各加工厂保证按期完成任务。为防止加工生产中的盲目混乱现象，委员会具体调查了各厂的机器设备和技术条件，将精密机器分配给设备和技术条件好的厂。在加工订货委员会和同业公会领导下，各厂分别组成了十四个生产组，每组以机器厂为核心，包括锻铁、铸铁、木型等工厂。加工协议由机器厂签订，其他锻铁、铸铁和木型等厂再和机器厂订立合同。由于采取了组织起来的办法，克服了私营工厂因机器设备缺乏而造成的生产上的困难。在分配任务时，委员会特别强调依靠群众完成任务的思想。曾先后召开了各厂老工人座谈会，详细研究加工中可能碰到的问题；又聘请了各厂的技术人员，进一步研究了各厂的具体情况，细致地估工估料，以免使国家财产受到损失，并保证资方获得合理利润。
    加工协议签订后，委员会又将各厂承做的活件种类、规格质量、验收方法、包装办法等材料印成文件，分发给各承做厂的基层工会，使职工心中有数，便于在生产中进行监督。在开始生产之后，加工订货委员会又抽调了十余名技术干部成立检查组，到各厂去发现问题，以做到及时解决。如发现除森泰、新北华两厂外，其余各厂烧焊都有砂眼。检查组就立即召集全市各厂烧焊工人，参观森泰、新北华两厂的烧焊工人表演，交流经验。现在各厂的烧焊问题已经基本解决。
    各厂资方接受这批加工机件后，都表示一定要很好地完成加工任务，支援祖国的经济建设。
