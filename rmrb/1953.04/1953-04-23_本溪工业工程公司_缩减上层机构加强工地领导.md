Benxi Industrial Engineering Company

Reduce Upper-Level Organizations, Strengthen Leadership at Construction Sites

In the past, the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company had a large organizational structure. The company headquarters alone had 475 cadres, and each engineering department had more than 200 cadres. Cadres who had previously served as construction site directors remained in the company or engineering departments, while newly transferred cadres were sent to the construction sites. Some construction site directors even concurrently served as Party branch secretaries, and other management cadres were not fully staffed. The construction sites had too few people, were overwhelmed, and the work was chaotic.

Recently, the company decided to reduce the number of personnel in the headquarters and send strong cadres to the construction sites. The number of management cadres in the company headquarters has now been reduced from 475 to 169. The engineering departments have also reduced their organizational structure. The First Engineering Department transferred three section chiefs to serve as directors at construction sites, and the Third Engineering Department transferred four section chiefs to serve as captains of joint engineering teams. The leadership strength at the construction sites has been greatly strengthened. Large construction sites now have three directors, and the cadres in the various functional groups at the construction sites have also been fully staffed. The company is continuing to send cadres to the construction sites.

    缩减上层机构加强工地领导
    本溪工业工程公司过去机构庞大，仅公司机关就有四百七十五名干部，各个工程处的干部也都在二百名以上。曾经做过工地主任的干部，都留在公司或工程处，派到工地的干部都是新转业的，有的工地主任还兼任党支部书记，其他管理干部也没配齐。工地人少，忙不过来，工作很混乱。
    最近，该公司决定减缩机关人员，把强的干部派往工地。现在公司机关管理干部已由四百七十五名减到一百六十九名。各工程处也都减缩了机关编制，第一工程处抽调三名科长到工地当主任，第三工程处抽出四名科长到联合工程队当队长。工地的领导力量大大加强了，大的工地有三个主任，工地的各职能组的干部也配齐了。现在公司还在继续往工地派干部。
