Tangshan Steel Plant's Rolling Mill Workshop achieved great success in mobilizing the masses to discuss planning. The production plan formulated after mass discussion increased output by 52.2 percent compared to the actual completed amount in 1952, and 22.3 percent higher than the original plan for 1953. Labor productivity increased by 33.64 percent compared to last year. Compared with the original task for 1953, after completing this year's plan, the country will increase steel production worth 63.9 billion yuan, and quality will also significantly improve. Taking 12 mm steel as an example, second-grade products decreased by 50 percent compared to the original plan, and waste products decreased by 60 percent. And costs can be reduced by 290 million yuan compared to the quota.

Their main experiences in mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan are:

Sufficient preparation
	1.  Learning from the experience of Factory 53, clarifying the center, unifying thinking and pace, and assigning responsibilities. At the beginning, the Party, administrative, trade union and Youth League cadres of the workshop studied various documents of Factory 53, and checked the shortcomings of the past Party, administrative, trade union and Youth League, such as the lack of clear central work, inconsistent leadership, and improper work coordination. For example, in the early stage of the investigation and determination work, the branch devoted itself to Party building work away from the investigation and determination work, the administrative leadership put production in opposition to the investigation and determination work, and the trade union went to evaluate model workers, which caused the investigation and determination work to drag on, and the quality indicators for January were not completed. Everyone, in view of these shortcomings, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and proposed the working policy for February as "Learning from the experience of Factory 53, focusing on revising the plan, consolidating and expanding the results of the investigation and determination." Around this policy, responsibilities were assigned, and plans were made separately: the Party branch was responsible for political and ideological leadership, investigated the ideological situation of employees, summarized advanced ideas, corrected backward and conservative ideas, and organized Party members and Youth League members to play a core role in the planning process; the administration was responsible for production investigation, reviewing quotas, compiling draft plans, summarizing advanced operating methods, handling tricks and rationalization proposals; under the leadership of the Party, the trade union organized and mobilized the masses to tap potential and find tricks, educated workers to discuss the plan with advanced ideas, and focused on trial-ordering group covenants and contact contracts; the Youth League called on Youth League members to play a vanguard role in the discussion and revision of the plan, and organized young workers to learn technology. In order to strengthen contact, a daily meeting of Party, administrative, trade union, and Youth League leading cadres was established to check and study work; this overcame the phenomenon of inconsistent leadership and assigned responsibilities without taking responsibility.

	2.  Conducting ideological investigation, educating employees, and making ideological preparations. After the workshop cadres unified their thinking, they concentrated their efforts to understand the ideological situation of the masses and eliminate various ideological obstacles. First, an ideological investigation was conducted on the second shift based on the quota. It was found that among the 55 people, 17 had a clear understanding of the quota, were familiar with various quota figures, and had confidence in completing it; 24 only generally understood the quota and held the attitude of "If others do it, I will do it too" and "Let's see if it can be completed." There were 14 people who had resistance to the quota. The leadership grasped these ideological situations, summarized the advanced ideas of production team leader Li Jiuchun in overcoming conservative thinking, leading the entire team to break through the new quota and create new records, and carried out education among the workers on revising the plan with a sense of ownership. They organized workers to study the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily, and used letters from the Spring Festival of the Chinese People's Volunteers to encourage the political enthusiasm of the workers. Among the cadres, the education of "The national plan is the law" was carried out to establish a serious attitude towards the plan. In addition, the third type of thinking was deeply explored, and it was found that because only people were drawn without increasing people in the past, and there were many new workers, the workers felt that the quota was high and lacked confidence in completing the task. Therefore, the trade union organized veteran workers to teach new workers technology. After repeated ideological education, the workers with the third type of thinking greatly changed. For example, steel haulers Li Chengxiang and Zhang Chunqing used to shout after hauling 960 steel bars: "I can't push any more, I have to add people." After this period of education, they came up with ways to improve work efficiency, and they didn't feel tired even after hauling 1,043 bars. This period of work laid a favorable mass ideological foundation for compiling the plan.

	3.  In-depth investigation and research on production conditions, review of quotas, identification of key points, and technical preparation. They checked the implementation of the 1952 plan and found that although there were great achievements last year, and the plan was overfulfilled, there were many shortcomings in plan management. For example, the plan could not be fully balanced, weight was emphasized over quality, and operating plans and various systems were unsound. Therefore, the plan was sometimes out of touch with reality, and production was sometimes loose at the beginning and tight at the end. Therefore, technical and management personnel were organized to start with reviewing quotas, checking workshop production, using re-measurement and thematic analysis methods to review quotas item by item, improving production instruction charts, modifying and improving maintenance systems and original records, and drafting a system of responsibility at all levels and operating points for rolling mills. During the inspection, two key issues were discovered: The first was that there were many machine accidents, and the operating rate was too low, which affected the completion of the output quota. The reasons for the accidents were: workers' unskilled operation, poor quality of rolling mills, and narrow site; and the main problem was that workers' operation was not skilled. The second was poor quality. In the second quarter, new quality specifications were to be implemented. If this problem was not solved, it would be even more difficult to reach the quota. In order to solve these two problems, a symposium of veteran technical workers and a symposium of Party and Youth League activists were held to discuss solutions. In order to solve the problem of workers' unskilled technology, the advanced operating methods of Liu Shaoqing and Yang Changbai were summarized and promoted. In addition, a special person was organized to study the advanced experience of automated steel rolling in the small-sized anti-encirclement disks of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and correctly estimated the active factors in the improvement of workers' technical level, management improvement, etc. Finally, the leadership proposed a draft of the annual production plan based on these circumstances and submitted it to the workers for discussion.

Mobilizing the masses to discuss
	During the discussion process, the key issue of quality in the workshop was firmly grasped, and the masses were mobilized to investigate the reasons and find solutions. Technical personnel and management personnel were organized to go deep into the groups to help workers discuss. As a result, the reasons and improvement methods were found for each of the eight topics related to quality. During the discussion of the plan, the entire workshop found a total of 64 tricks, including 21 related to quality and 7 major tricks. After discussing these topics, the plan indicators were discussed item by item. Because the workers had a bottom line in their minds and enhanced their confidence, the plan was discussed and revised well, overcoming the tendency to increase output based solely on enthusiasm and conservatism. After the team and group plans were made, the workshop organized forces to balance the work and make the plans for the entire workshop.

Formulating group covenants and contact contracts
	In order to gain experience in formulating group covenants and contact contracts, the workers in the two groups of the second shift, the reheating furnace and the rolling mill, were first organized to learn from the experience of Factory 53 in formulating group covenants and contact contracts. Then the masses were mobilized to find out the weak links and existing problems of the group, discussed the improvement methods, and used them as the main content of the group covenant. For example, it was found that the operating rate was low, mostly due to accidents caused by net steel and flattening. The workers incorporated the advanced operating method of "tightening the pliers and sending them in more than a foot before loosening the pliers when entering the steel" into one of the covenants. In order to overcome the weak link of low technology in the group, the workshop summarized the steel entry operating methods of Yang Changbai and Liu Shaoqing. The group incorporated learning this advanced experience into the covenant, and proposed a system for veteran workers to teach new workers. In order to overcome the phenomenon of grabbing a handful of chaos in production, the system of sole responsibility was clarified. After repeated discussions by the masses, the team leader summarized everyone's opinions, put forward a draft, and after being supplemented and revised by the masses, the group covenant was formally signed. On this basis, in order to strengthen the cooperation between the two groups and overcome the phenomena of unclear responsibility and mutual complaints and procrastination in the past, after discussion by the workers of the two groups, a contact contract was also signed.

	During the formulation of the group covenant, the Party branch always firmly grasped ideological leadership. When the workers started to formulate the covenant, they did not have enough understanding of the role of the group covenant, so they lacked confidence, and had ideological emotions such as "It doesn't matter whether we make it or not," "I'm afraid of being bound after making it," and "What if we can't do it after making it." At this time, the Party branch organized workers to study, educate Party members and Youth League members to unite the masses and play a backbone role. After the two groups implemented the group covenant and contact contract, a mass upsurge of learning advanced experience was set off, which improved technology. Due to close cooperation, the handover time has been reduced from 15 to 20 minutes in the past to 9 minutes, the quota has been consolidated, and the February production plan has been guaranteed to be completed. The experience of key experiments was obtained, that is, organizing typical reports, and generally signing group covenants and contact contracts in the entire workshop around the March production plan.

    唐山钢厂轧钢车间发动群众讨论计划的经验
    中共唐山钢厂党委会秘书刘蓉
    唐山钢厂轧钢车间发动群众讨论计划，取得了很大成绩。经过群众讨论后制定的生产计划，产量比一九五二年实际完成数量提高了百分之五十二点二，比一九五三年原计划提高了百分之二十二点三，劳动生产率较去年提高了百分之三十三点六四。与一九五三年原任务相比较，今年计划完成后，将为国家增产价值六百三十九亿元的钢材，质量也显著地提高了。以十二公厘钢材为例，二级品较原计划减少了百分之五十，废品减少了百分之六十。而成本则可较定额降低二亿九千万元。
    他们发动群众讨论计划的主要经验是：
    充分做好准备工作
    1、学习五三工厂经验，明确中心，统一思想和步调，分工负责。开始时，车间的党、行政、工会和青年团干部学习了五三工厂的各种文件，检查了过去党、行政、工会和青年团中心工作不明确，领导不统一、工作配合不当的缺点。如在搞查定工作的初期，支部脱离查定工作专搞建党工作，行政领导上把生产与查定工作对立起来，工会又去搞评选模范，致使查定工作拖拖拉拉，一月份质量指标也没有完成。大家针对这些缺点，开展了批评与自我批评，提出了二月份的工作方针是“学习五三工厂经验，以修订计划为中心，巩固与扩大查定成果”。围绕着这个方针，分工负责，分头作出计划：党支部负责政治思想领导，调查职工思想情况，总结先进思想，纠正落后保守思想，并组织党员、团员在订计划中起核心作用；行政负责生产调查，复查定额，编制计划草案，总结先进操作法，处理窍门和合理化建议；工会在党的领导下组织与发动群众挖潜力、找窍门，教育工人以先进的思想讨论计划，并有重点地试订小组公约和联系合同；青年团则号召团员在讨论与修订计划中起先锋作用，并组织青工学习技术。为了加强联系，健全了每日一次的党、行政、工会、青年团领导干部的碰头会，检查和研究工作；这样就克服了领导不统一、分了工但不负责的现象。
    2、进行思想调查，教育职工，做好思想准备。车间干部思想统一后，即集中力量了解群众的思想情况，消除各种思想障碍。首先以定额为根据向二班进行了思想调查，发现在五十五人中，对定额有明确认识、并熟悉各项定额数字、有信心能完成的有十七人；只一般地了解定额、抱着“人家干我也干”、“完成完不成干着看”的态度，对完成定额信心不足的有二十四人；对定额有抵抗思想的有十四人。领导上掌握了这些思想情况，就总结了生产组长李久春克服保守思想、带动全组突破新定额、创造新纪录的先进思想，在工人中进行了以主人翁态度修订好计划的教育，组织工人学习了人民日报元旦社论，又以志愿军春节来信鼓舞工人的政治积极性。在干部中则进行了“国家计划就是法律”的教育，以树立对待计划的严肃态度。另外又深挖了第三类思想，发现由于过去只抽人不增加人，新工人又多，所以工人们感觉定额高，缺乏完成任务的信心。于是工会就组织老工人教新工人技术。这样反复地进行了思想教育，有第三类思想的工人大大转变了。如运钢工人李成祥和张春庆，过去运九百六十根钢就喊：“再多就推不了，非得添人不可。”经过这一段教育，他们想出了提高工作效率的办法，运一千零四十三条还不嫌累，这一段工作给编好计划打下了有利的群众思想基础。
    3、深入调查研究生产情况，复查定额，找出关键，做好技术准备工作。他们检查了一九五二年计划的执行情况，发现去年虽然有很大成绩，超额完成了计划；但在计划管理上却存在着许多缺点。如计划不能全面平衡完成，重量不重质，作业计划和各项制度不健全，因此计划有时与实际脱节，生产有时前松后紧。于是便组织了技术人员和管理人员从复查定额入手，检查车间生产情况，用复测和专题分析的办法，逐项审核了定额，改进了生产指示图表，修改与健全了检修制度和原始记录，草拟了逐级负责制和轧辊的操作要点。在检查中，发现了两个关键问题：第一是机器事故多，作业率过低，影响完成产量定额。造成事故原因是：工人操作不熟练，轧辊质量不好，场地狭窄；而工人操作不熟练则是主要症结。第二是质量不好，第二季度还要实行新的质量规格，这问题如不解决，就更难达到定额。为了解决这两个问题，召开了老技术工人座谈会、党团员积极分子座谈会，酝酿解决的办法。为了解决工人技术不熟练的问题，总结了刘少卿、杨长栢的先进操作法，加以推广。另外组织了专人学习鞍山钢铁公司小型厂反围盘自动化轧钢的先进经验，并正确估计了工人技术水平的提高、管理的改进等方面的积极因素，最后由领导上根据这些情况提出了全年的生产计划草案，交工人讨论。
    发动群众讨论
    在讨论过程中，紧紧地抓住了车间的关键问题——质量，发动群众查原因，找办法。并组织了技术人员、管理人员深入小组，帮助工人讨论。结果在有关质量的八个课题上逐件找出了原因及改进的办法。在讨论计划中，全车间共找出了窍门六十四件，其中有关质量的二十一件，重大的窍门七件。讨论了这些课题后，再逐项讨论计划指标。由于工人心中有了底，增强了信心，结果计划讨论与修订得很好，克服了只凭热情提高产量和保守的倾向。班组计划订出了以后，车间又组织力量进行了平衡的工作，订出了全车间的计划。制订小组公约和联系合同
    为了取得订立小组公约和联系合同的经验，在第二班再热炉和轧钢机两个小组首先组织工人学习五三工厂订小组公约和联系合同的经验，然后发动群众，找出了小组的薄弱环节和存在的问题，讨论了改进办法，作为小组公约的主要内容。如发现作业率低，多是因为网钢、扁过的事故所造成，工人就将“入钢时用钳加紧送进一尺多再松钳子”的先进操作方法订为公约中的一项。为了克服小组技术低的薄弱环节，车间总结了杨长栢、刘少卿的入钢操作法。该组就将学习这个先进经验订到公约中去，并提出老工人教新工人的操作制度。为了克服生产中乱抓一把的现象，又明确了单一负责制。经过群众反复讨论，由小组长综合了大家的意见，提出草案，经过群众补充修正后，就正式签订了小组公约。在这个基础上，为了加强两组的配合，克服过去发生问题责任不明、互相埋怨推拖等现象，经两组工人讨论，又订立了联系合同。
    在订立小组公约当中，党支部始终抓紧了思想领导。工人开始制订时，对小组公约的作用认识不足，因而缺乏信心，有“订不订都可以”、“订了怕受束缚”、“订了做不到怎么办”等思想情绪；这时党支部就组织工人学习，教育党、团员团结群众，起骨干作用。这两个小组实行小组公约和联系合同后，掀起了群众学习先进经验的热潮，提高了技术。由于配合密切，交接班时间已由过去十五—二十分钟缩减到九分钟，巩固了定额，并保证完成了二月份生产计划。取得了重点试验的经验，即组织典型报告，围绕着三月份的生产计划，在全车间普遍签订了小组公约和联系合同。
