Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Tokyo: Following the Japanese Communist Party's call for all parties opposing rearmament to form a united front in the general election, the Japanese Labor-Farmer Party sent Labor-Farmer Party councilors Makoto Hori and Seiichi Suzuki as representatives to the JCP on March 28th, proposing a joint struggle between the two parties in the general election. Tanaka Matsujiro of the JCP Central Guidance Department immediately accepted the Labor-Farmer Party's proposal on behalf of the JCP and guaranteed that the JCP would make its utmost efforts in the joint election struggle.

The Labor-Farmer Party's proposal for a united election front to the Communist Party first expressed its respect for the JCP's heroic struggle in the general election. The proposal put forward the goal of establishing a democratic government serving the people and suggested that the two parties jointly strive for the following three points: 1. Abolish the San Francisco Treaty, the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement"; 2. Oppose rearmament and uphold the Peaceful Constitution; 3. Stabilize the people's livelihood.

The JCP Central Guidance Department formally replied to the Labor-Farmer Party in writing on March 30th, declaring its complete agreement and acceptance of its proposal. The JCP's reply, after expressing confidence that the united front will continue to expand, stated that the Communist Party will henceforth have more confidence and courage to work with the Labor-Farmer Party on the basis of the unity of the people to realize the people's demands.

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Tokyo: In this Japanese election campaign, the Yoshida Liberal Party has been increasingly rejected by voters.

Yoshida Liberal Party candidates have been rebuked by audiences in many places when holding election speeches, often exposing their ugly态 and causing them extreme embarrassment. Even Yoshida Shigeru himself is no exception. Yoshida said ingratiatingly when campaigning in Osaka on the 9th: "For economic independence and prosperity, the Yoshida Liberal Party must obtain an absolute majority in the Diet." However, these words immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of the Osaka citizens who had suffered the pain of the Yoshida Liberal Party's "absolute majority." They booed on the spot, and even under strict police guard, a citizen went to the podium and angrily rebuked Yoshida, saying: "Yoshida's talk about opposing rearmament and economic independence is a deceptive lie." Yoshida's henchmen brutally beat the citizen and ordered the police to take him away. On the 10th, Yoshida went to his hometown of Kochi Prefecture to conduct campaign activities. Only less than a hundred people went to the station to welcome him, which was much colder than the situation in the last general election.

Even in rural areas under the rule of feudal forces, and in rural areas where there are US military bases, voters have expressed indifference to the reactionary Yoshida Liberal Party. Kyodo News said: Although the reactionary party candidates such as the Yoshida Liberal Party have hidden the slogan of rearmament, no matter how the "election trucks parked in front of the wheat fields keep calling out," the masses "are still completely without expression." Kyodo News' reports on the election situation in Chitose, Tachikawa, Yokosuka and other places where there are US military bases also show that the Japanese people, who have suffered from the Yoshida government's policy of national betrayal, are increasingly spurning the Yoshida Liberal Party. On the contrary, Kyodo News admits that candidates who oppose rearmament and advocate the abolition of military bases and the withdrawal of occupying forces have gained the "favor" of "conservative farmers."

    日本共产党和劳农党结成竞选统一战线
    努力争取废除吉田政府的卖国条约反对重整军备
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：在日本共产党号召所有的反对重整军备的党派在大选中结成统一战线之后，日本劳农党在三月二十八日派劳农党参议员堀真琴和铃木清一为代表，向日共提出两党在大选中进行联合斗争的建议。日共中央指导部田中松次郎当即代表日共诚挚地接受了劳农党的建议，并保证日共将以最大的努力进行联合竞选的斗争。
    劳农党向共产党提出的统一竞选建议书首先对日共在大选中的英勇斗争表示敬意。建议书提出了建立为人民服务的民主政府的目标，并建议两党为下列三点共同奋斗：一、废除旧金山和约、美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”；二、反对重整军备、拥护和平宪法；三、稳定人民生活。
    日共中央指导部又在三月三十日以书面正式答复劳农党，声明完全同意和接受它的建议。日共的答复在表示了对于统一战线必将不断扩大的信心之后，表示共产党今后将更有信心和勇气地和劳农党一道在人民的团结的基础上为实现人民的要求而努力奋斗。
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：在这次日本竞选运动中，吉田自由党已经遭到愈来愈多的选民的唾弃。
    吉田自由党的候选人，在举行竞选演说会时，在许多的地方都受到听众的斥责，常常使他们丑态毕露，狼狈不堪。即使是吉田茂本人也不例外。吉田九日在大阪竞选时笼络人心地说：“为了经济的自立和繁荣，吉田自由党必须在国会获得绝对多数。”但是这些话立即激起饱尝吉田自由党“绝对多数”的痛苦的大阪市民的不满，他们当场哄起来，虽在警察的严密戒备下仍然有一个市民走上讲台忿怒地斥责吉田说：“吉田所说的反对重整军备和经济自立是一种骗人的话。”吉田的亲信竟野蛮地殴打这个市民，并命令警察把他带走。十日，吉田到他的故乡高知县去进行竞选活动。到车站去欢迎的寥寥不到一百人，比上次大选时的情况冷落得多了。
    即使在封建势力统治下的农村，以及在设有美国军事基地的农村，选民也对反动的吉田自由党表示冷淡。共同社说：吉田自由党等反动党派候选人虽然藏起了重整军备的口号，但“停在麦地面前的竞选卡车不论怎样不停地呼喊”，群众“也仍旧是完全没有表情的”。共同社报道设有美国军事基地的千岁、立川、横须贺等地竞选情形的消息也表明：饱受吉田政府卖国政策的痛苦的日本人民是越来越唾弃吉田自由党了。相反地，共同社承认，反对重整军备、主张撤销军事基地和撤退占领军的候选人却得到了“保守农民”的“好感”。
