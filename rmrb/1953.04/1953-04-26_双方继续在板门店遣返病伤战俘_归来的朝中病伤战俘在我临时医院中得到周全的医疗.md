Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 25th: The Korean Armistice Talks' Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communique on April 25th:

　　On April 25th, both sides continued to repatriate sick and wounded prisoners of war at Panmunjom. Our side repatriated to the other side 75 Korean sick and wounded POWs, 17 American sick and wounded POWs, 4 British sick and wounded POWs, and 4 Turkish sick and wounded POWs, for a total of 100. The other side repatriated 500 sick and wounded captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 25th: Today, our side continued to hand over to the U.S. side 17 American POWs, 4 British and 4 Turkish POWs, and 75 Korean POWs at Panmunjom. Since the exchange of sick and wounded POWs began on the 20th of this month, our side has handed over 200 non-Korean POWs and 400 Korean POWs to the U.S. side. Tomorrow, our side will continue to repatriate 13 American POWs and 71 Korean POWs. Today, the U.S. side delivered 500 sick and wounded personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, including as many as 25 psychiatric patients. According to the U.S. side, 50 of the 494 People's Army sick and wounded personnel to be repatriated to our side tomorrow are also psychiatric patients. So many mental patients are clearly the result of forced screening and other persecutions on Geoje Island.

　　According to the sick and wounded personnel of the Korean People's Army repatriated today, the U.S. side has been conducting strict searches of the Korean and Chinese sick and wounded personnel to be repatriated since the 22nd, confiscating national flags and slogans. The hats worn by those returning today were all torn open by U.S. search personnel. Despite this, these sick and wounded personnel still brought back several Korean national flags, which they preserved at great risk.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency: The sick and wounded captured personnel of our side who have been returning successively are living a normal convalescent life in peace and happiness in the temporary hospitals set up in Kaesong. The hospitals have prepared a large number of medicines for them, set up relatively comprehensive medical equipment, and mobilized a large number of excellent medical and nursing personnel. After one to several thorough examinations of their condition or injuries, the sick and wounded personnel are admitted to warm, clean, and quiet wards. According to the medical records provided by the other side, the vast majority of them have not received medical treatment. At present, in addition to providing medical treatment for those with serious illnesses and unhealed wounds, the hospitals also provide lung tuberculosis patients with nutritious food and various vegetables every day. Each patient takes two types of multiple vitamins daily, and seriously ill patients are also injected with glucose and other drugs. The returning sick and wounded captured personnel are deeply moved by the kind care of their comrades. The entire sick and wounded personnel of a temporary hospital have collectively written a letter to the hospital staff to express their gratitude.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: According to a report from Panmunjom by "L'Humanité" reporter Béchade on the 24th: The Korean and Chinese sick and wounded POWs I spoke with this afternoon are very different from those who staggered out of the U.S. ambulances a few days ago. Physically, they are still the surviving, incomplete people and lung patients from Geoje Island. When the ambulance doors opened and they saw their Korean-Chinese comrades waiting to welcome them, the pent-up emotions in their hearts were swept away, and tears of joy welled up in their eyes. But spiritually, they are new people. Just twenty-four and forty-eight hours of freedom have made their pale complexions disappear, and their dull eyes have brought radiance. Today, I saw them wearing new Korean-Chinese uniforms, showered, shaved, and resting in the club and garden of a reception hospital. The club and garden were built only a few days ago, with peach and cherry trees inside, surrounded by neat fences. They look at pictorials, play chess, listen to records, and talk to friends who were separated by barbed wire on Geoje Island. Radiant white-coated nurses walk among them, bringing them cigarettes and sweets. A few yards away, nurses are packing the condolence bags sent by the Korean-Chinese Red Cross, which contain shirts, underwear, toiletries, and sweets wrapped in neat canvas bags.

　　Outside the club, groups of people gathered around loudspeakers, which broadcast music and frequently broadcast the day's program. Personnel from the Korean National Theater Troupe, the Korean People's Army Song and Dance Troupe, and the Chinese Art Troupe performed in the reception barracks, and the programs were the best. The people of Kaesong waited in crowds on the road where the ambulance convoy passed, holding flowers and flags to welcome the convoy. All repatriated people are able to eat four very rich hot meals a day. Hearing them sing today, it is hard to believe that these are the same weak voices of those who had just gained freedom and were safely singing in the Korean-Chinese ambulance leaving the Panmunjom reception station. A few hours and days of freedom, good food, and plenty of rest have completely changed these people.

    双方继续在板门店遣返病伤战俘
    归来的朝中病伤战俘在我临时医院中得到周全的医疗
    【新华社开城二十五日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十五日发表公报如下：
    四月二十五日双方继续在板门店遣返病伤战俘。我方遣返给对方朝鲜籍病伤战俘七十五人，美籍病伤战俘十七人，英籍病伤战俘四人，土耳其籍病伤战俘四人，总共一百人。对方遣返给我方朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员五百人。
    【新华社开城二十五日电】今天我方在板门店继续交给美方美国籍战俘十七人，英国籍和土耳其籍战俘各四人，朝鲜籍战俘七十五人。自本月二十日伤病战俘交换开始以来，我方已交给美方非朝鲜籍战俘二百人，朝鲜籍战俘四百人。明天我方将继续遣返美籍战俘十三人，朝鲜籍战俘七十一人。美方今天送交我方朝鲜人民军伤病员五百人，其中有精神病患者二十五人之多。另据美方通知，明天遣返我方的四百九十四名人民军伤病员中又有精神病患者五十人。这样多的精神病人，显然是巨济岛上强迫甄别和其他迫害的结果。
    据今天被遣返的朝鲜人民军病伤人员说：从二十二日起，美方对将被遣返的朝中伤病员进行严格的搜查，把国旗和标语等尽行搜去，今天回来的所戴的帽子就全部被美方搜查人员拆开过。但尽管如此，这些伤病员仍然带来了好几面朝鲜国旗，这是冒了很大的危险才保存下来的。
    据新华社讯：陆续归来的我方病伤被俘人员，正在设于开城的各临时医院里安心而愉快地过着正常的疗养生活。各医院都为他们准备了大量的药品，设置了比较周全的医疗设备，并调集了大量优秀的医疗和护理人员。伤病员们经过一次到数次病情或伤情的彻底检查，分别住进各个温暖、整洁、而宁静的病室。根据对方交来的病情介绍看，他们绝大多数都没有经过医药治疗。现在各医院除对重病和伤口未愈者分别进行医药治疗外，每日并以营养丰富的食品和各种菜蔬供给肺结核病人。每个患者每天都服两类多种维他命，重患者还注射葡萄糖等药品。归来的病伤被俘人员受到自己同志如此亲切的照料，都深深感动。某临时医院全体伤病员已经集体写信给医院工作人员表示感谢。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌二十四日自板门店报道：今天下午和我谈话的朝中病伤战俘和前几天从美方救护车里蹒跚走出的那些人大不相同。从身体上说，他们仍然是巨济岛上的幸存的肢体不全的人和肺病患者，当救护车的车门打开，他们看到他们的朝中同志正在等着欢迎他们的时候，他们心中的郁积情绪一扫而空，快乐的热泪夺眶而出。但是从精神上说，他们是新人了。短短的二十四小时和四十八小时的自由，已使他们的苍白面色消失了，他们的黯然无光的眼睛带来了神采。今天我看到他们穿着新的朝中制服，洗了澡，刮了胡子，在一所接待医院的俱乐部和花园里休息。俱乐部和花园是在几天以前才建成的，花园里面有着桃树和樱桃树，周围有着整齐的篱笆。他们看画报、下棋、听唱片，和曾在巨济岛上被有电铁丝网隔开的朋友们谈天。神采奕奕的白衣护士在他们中间走来走去，替他们拿香烟和糖果。在几码以外的地方，护士们正在收拾从朝中红十字会寄来的慰问袋，里面有着用整齐的帆布背袋包着的衬衫、内衣、盥洗用具和糖果。
    在俱乐部外面，成群的人聚在扩音器旁边，扩音器广播着音乐，并不时广播着当天的节目。朝鲜国家剧团、朝鲜人民军歌舞团和中国文工团的人员在接待营房里演出，节目都是最好的。开城人民成群地在救护车队经过的路上等着，拿着鲜花和旗子向车队表示欢迎。所有被遣返的人每天能够吃到四顿非常丰富的热饭。听到他们今天唱歌的声音，简直使人难以相信这就是刚得到自由以后安全地坐在朝中救护车里唱歌离开板门店接收站的那些人的有气无力的声音。几个小时和几天的自由、良好的食物和充分的休息，已使这些人完全变了样子。
