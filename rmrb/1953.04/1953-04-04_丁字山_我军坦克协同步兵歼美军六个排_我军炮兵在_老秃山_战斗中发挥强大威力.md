Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st. Our correspondent reports: While our troops were attacking "Old Baldy," our troops on "D-Shaped Hill" northwest of Tieyuan also launched a victorious attack on three enemy positions in their sector. A total of six platoons, one squad of American troops, and a portion of a labor service team composed of South Korean soldiers were annihilated, totaling more than 260 men.

    This battle took place on a dark night after the spring rain had just stopped, the accumulated snow had melted, and the roads were muddy. Before the attack, our assault team members wore padded trousers, new single-layered military caps just shipped from the motherland, and tightened the laces of their new rubber shoes. They stood solemnly before the portrait of Comrade Stalin and swore: "Resolutely strike the enemy and strive for victory in battle!"

    At exactly 8 o'clock, our assault troops set out. The soldiers waded through ditches of waist-deep water, crossed countless shell craters filled with muddy water, and advanced along muddy mountain roads. Before the assault troops launched their charge, our artillery opened fire on the enemy. Countless pillars of fire rose from the enemy's positions, and most of the enemy's fortifications were destroyed. The enemy's artillery was also suppressed by our sudden artillery fire. At this time, volunteer army tanks appeared on the battlefield, emitting a steel-like roar, and the mud kicked up by the tracks splashed everywhere. The infantry soldiers cheered excitedly, shouting: "Charge! Our tanks are here!" They followed the tanks like fierce tigers. After the tanks reached the enemy's forward positions, they used accurate artillery fire to destroy some of the enemy's remaining strongholds. The infantry soldiers divided into five routes and charged up the mountain. The right wing of our attacking troops first captured the high ground on the right side of Shixian Cave North Mountain, and another route also captured another high ground on the left side in more than ten minutes. Our troops attacking the enemy's main position on the front also quickly approached the top of the mountain. Luo Shengyu, the squad leader of the assault squad, cleared three barbed wire fences and destroyed five enemy pillboxes with grenades. He was the first to lead all the soldiers of his squad to occupy the top of the mountain. The enemy, attempting to resist stubbornly, launched three counterattacks against our troops, all of which were repelled. The remaining enemies were suppressed by our troops around the enemy's company command post. Our soldiers continued to attack while shouting in English: "Those who lay down their arms will not be killed; prisoners will be treated leniently!" Some enemies surrendered and were safe, while those who refused to surrender were all annihilated. Three enemy tanks and five vehicles loaded with enemy troops that had rushed to reinforce were all repelled by our artillery fire. The battle lasted 55 minutes. Our troops annihilated two platoons of the 11th Company of the 31st Regiment of the U.S. 7th Division and its company headquarters, one platoon of the 4th Company, one platoon of the 10th Company, one platoon of the U.S. 1st Corps Service Company, and a portion of a labor service team composed of South Korean soldiers.

    Simultaneously with the capture of this mountain, another unit of our army captured Shuangshudong East Mountain southeast of "D-Shaped Hill" and the 190.8 high ground on the front of "D-Shaped Hill", annihilating one platoon and one squad of American troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 2nd. Our correspondent Zhang Tao reports: In the battle of "Old Baldy," our artillery displayed great power.

    In the spring of Korea, the melting snow and drizzling spring rain made the roads muddy. Before this battle began, our artillery, with the assistance of the infantry, pulled thousands of pounds of heavy artillery into new positions. Artillery soldiers covered in mud overcame countless difficulties and completed the preparations for attacking "Old Baldy."

    At exactly 8:00 p.m. on March 23, artillery of various calibers roared towards "Old Baldy" simultaneously. The explosions of the shells shook the valley, and a blaze of light rose from "Old Baldy," illuminating the waters of the Yigu River. Seven minutes later, a red flare was launched from the main peak, signaling that our infantry had occupied the hilltop. Under such intense artillery fire, a reinforced enemy company was annihilated by our troops in 45 minutes. The enemies in four tanks were also so frightened that they crawled under the tanks and dared not move. Later, a Colombian prisoner of war described their situation at the time, saying, "It was the first time I had encountered such intense artillery fire. People were trembling in the bunkers, and whispering to each other, 'Don't talk!'"

    After our troops occupied "Old Baldy," the artillery also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy in the battle to repel enemy counterattacks against "Old Baldy." Xie Genlai, a volunteer army infantry soldier, said: "Our artillery is so accurate that a large part of the enemy was wiped out by artillery fire before they even reached us. Later, the enemy was so frightened by the sound of their own artillery that they would burrow into the mounds." At 8:00 a.m. on the 24th, just as a battalion of enemy troops arrived at the foot of "Old Baldy," row after row of shells fell into the enemy ranks, scattering the enemy troops in all directions. The enemy commander desperately waved his flag but could not stop them. At 11:00 a.m. on the 26th, a battalion of enemy troops took advantage of the smoke from the shelling to sneak close to the northeast foot of the main peak of Old Baldy from Shixian Cave. At this time, our commanders had already ordered all types of artillery to be prepared. When the enemy entered the marked position, the mortars blocked the enemy first, and then all types of artillery launched a "volley," and thousands of shells fell like a rainstorm, smashing the panicked enemy into a pulp within two minutes.

    “丁字山”我军坦克协同步兵歼美军六个排
    我军炮兵在“老秃山”战斗中发挥强大威力
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】本社记者报道：在我军攻打“老秃山”的同时，铁原西北“丁字山”上的我军也向当面敌军的三处阵地，发起了一次胜利的出击。共歼灭美军六个排、一个班和由南朝鲜士兵组成的劳役队一部，计二百六十多名。
    这次战斗是在春雨初停、积雪融化、道路泥泞的黑夜进行的。在攻击前，我军袭击队员们穿着夹裤，戴上刚从祖国运来的单军帽，扎紧新胶鞋上的带子，站在斯大林同志遗像前庄严宣誓：“坚决打击敌人，争取战斗的胜利！”
    八时正，我军攻击部队出发了。战士们淌过一道道水深及腰的沟渠，越过无数积满泥水的炮弹坑，沿着泥泞的山路前进。在攻击部队发起冲锋以前，我军大炮向敌军开火，敌人阵地被我军大炮炮弹炸起无数根火柱，敌人修筑的工事大部分被摧毁了，敌军大炮也被我军突发的炮火压制住。这时，战场上出现了志愿军的坦克，它们发出钢铁般地轰响，履带掀起的烂泥四处飞溅。步兵战士们兴奋地高声欢呼着：“冲啊！我们的坦克来了！”一个个猛虎似地跟着坦克前进。坦克开到近敌军前沿阵地后，即以准确的炮火，摧毁敌人残存的一些火力点，步兵战士分成五路向山上冲锋。我攻击部队的右翼首先攻占了石岘洞北山右侧的高地，另一路也以十余分钟的时间攻占了左侧的另一个高地；向正面敌军主阵地攻击的我军也迅速地逼近了山顶。突击班班长罗生誉扫除了三道带刺铁丝网，用手榴弹炸毁了敌人五个暗堡，他首先带领全班战士占领了山顶。企图顽抗的敌人曾向我军进行了三次反扑，都被打退，残敌并被我军压制在敌军连指挥所周围。我军战士一面继续攻击，一面用英语喊话：“缴枪不杀，宽待俘虏！”有的敌人举手投降得到了安全，拒不投降的敌人都被消灭。仓皇赶来增援的三辆敌军坦克和五辆汽车装载来的敌军都被我军炮火击退。这次战斗历时五十五分钟，我军歼灭美军第七师三十一团第十一连两个排及其连部，第四连一个排、第十连一个排，及美军一军团勤务队一个排，和南朝鲜士兵组成的劳役队一部。
    与攻占这一山岭同时，我军另一支部队攻占了“丁字山”东南的霜树洞东山和“丁字山”正面的一九零点八高地，歼灭美军一个排又一个班。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】本社记者张涛报道：“老秃山”战斗中，我军炮兵发挥了强大的威力。
    朝鲜的春天，溶化了的雪和霏霏的春雨把道路弄得泥泞不堪，这次战斗发起之前，我军炮兵在步兵的协助下，把数千斤重的大炮拉进了新的阵地。满身泥浆的炮兵战士们，克服了无数的困难，完成了攻打“老秃山”的准备工作。
    三月二十三日晚八时正，我军各种口径的大炮同时向“老秃山”怒吼起来，炮弹的爆炸声震撼山谷，“老秃山”上腾起一片火光，照亮了驿谷川的河水。七分钟后，主峰上就升起了我军步兵占领山头的红色信号弹。在这样猛烈炮火的轰击下，守敌一个加强连在四十五分钟内就被我军歼灭了。四辆坦克里的敌人也吓得心慌意乱地爬到坦克底下，不敢动弹。后来，一个哥伦比亚军俘虏描述他们当时的情形说：“我第一次遇到这样激烈的炮火，人们都伏在洞子里发抖，互相用微弱的声音说：‘不要说话！’”
    我军攻占“老秃山”后，在配合步兵打退敌军向“老秃山”反扑的战斗中，炮兵也给予敌人很大的杀伤。一位志愿军步兵战士谢根来说：“我们的炮真准，敌人没有到我们跟前，就被炮火打掉了一大半。敌人后来听到他们自己的炮响也吓得往土堆里钻。”二十四日上午八时，一个营的敌人刚到“老秃山”下，一排接一排的炮弹就落在敌群中，打得敌军四处逃窜，敌军指挥官拚命摇旗子也制止不住。二十六日上午十一时，一个营的敌人趁着炮轰的烟雾由石岘洞偷偷接近到老秃山主峰东北山脚。这时，我军指挥员早已命令各种炮火做好准备，等敌人进到标定好的位置时，迫击炮先把敌人拦住，然后各种炮火来了一阵“齐放”，千百发炮弹像暴雨似地落下去，在两分钟内就把慌乱成一团的敌人打得稀烂。
