Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th: The U.S. 7th Division, which was battered and bruised by our army on the Shangganling battlefield, has suffered over 3,000 casualties inflicted by our army in the two months since it was transferred to the Yikgokchon line east of Soning on the Western Front at the end of January this year.

The U.S. 7th Division suffered heavy casualties in the Shangganling Campaign, with many companies losing more than half their personnel. After a brief period of rest and replenishment with a large number of South Korean soldiers, the U.S. 7th Division was rushed to the Western Front. However, since returning to the battlefield, the U.S. 7th Division has continued to suffer repeated defeats. On the night of February 13th, the U.S. 7th Division troops guarding the 167.6-meter high ground east of Yujuk-ri, southeast of Soning, were attacked by our night raid team, and most of two platoons were wiped out. On February 22nd and 23rd, U.S. 7th Division troops maneuvering in front of the阵地 were ambushed by our army, and most of two platoons, totaling 72 men, were annihilated. On March 8th, a reinforced platoon from the 1st Company of the 31st Regiment of the U.S. 7th Division was ambushed at the foot of General Hill South, and was completely wiped out by our counter-ambush forces. On March 10th, enemy troops launched an attack on our army's position on the southeastern mountain of Shangpu-ri, and more than 150 were wiped out. Captured enemy soldiers told our soldiers despondently, "Attacking your positions is like suicide, we already knew this from the Kimhwa campaign!"

On March 23rd, our army attacked "Old Baldy," annihilating all the defending enemy troops. In the following four days, we repelled successive counterattacks by the 31st and 32nd Regiments of the U.S. 7th Division. In these few days of fighting, a total of more than 1,700 U.S. 7th Division troops were killed or wounded. Captured U.S. 7th Division soldiers said sadly, "Autumn on the Kimhwa front was terrible, and spring on the 'Old Baldy' front is also terrible!"

    美军第七师在西线连战连败被歼三千多人
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】在上甘岭战场上被我军打得焦头烂额的美军第七师，自今年一月底调到西线朔宁以东驿谷川一线后，在两个月内又被我军杀伤了三千多人。
    美七师在上甘岭战役中伤亡惨重，不少连队伤亡了一半以上。美七师在经过短暂的休整，补充了大批南朝鲜士兵以后，又被赶上西线战场。但美七师这次重新上阵以来依然是连战连败。二月十三日深夜，守在朔宁东南鱼积山里以东的一六七点六高地上的美七师部队，在我夜袭队的打击下，两个排的大部被消灭了。二月二十二日、二十三日两天，在阵前游动的美七师部队，遭到我军伏兵的痛击，被歼灭两个排的大部共七十二名。三月八日，美七师三十一团一连一个加强排在将军洞南山脚埋伏，又被我反伏击部队全部歼灭了。三月十日，敌军向上浦防东南山我军阵地进犯，又被消灭了一百五十多名。被俘的敌军士兵灰心丧气地对我军战士说：“进攻你们的阵地就等于自杀，这早在金化战役中我们就知道了！”
    三月二十三日，我军攻打“老秃山”，将守敌全部歼灭。在以后的四天中又打退了美七师三十一团和三十二团的连续反扑。这几天的战斗中共杀伤美七师部队一千七百多名。被俘的美七师士兵悲哀地说：“金化前线的秋天是可怕的，‘老秃山’前线的春天也是可怕的！”
