Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Tokyo news: The "Executive Committee for Commemorating the Chinese Captive Martyrs," composed of more than ten groups, including the Japanese Red Cross, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Buddhist Federation, and the Tokyo Chinese Overseas Association, held a solemn memorial meeting at Asakusa Honganji Temple in Tokyo on April 1 to commemorate the Chinese soldiers and conscripted Chinese laborers who were abused and murdered by Japanese militarists at the Hanaoka Mine in Akita Prefecture, Japan, on the eve of Japan's surrender in 1945.

Many representatives from Japanese democratic groups, trade unions, and overseas Chinese groups attended the memorial meeting. Flowers and wreaths from groups such as the Japanese Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Democratic United Front of Korean Residents in Japan were placed in front of the remains of the Chinese martyrs.

The work of the "Executive Committee for Commemorating the Chinese Captive Martyrs" is to investigate the incidents of abuse and murder of Chinese prisoners of war in various parts of Japan during the war, to investigate and collect the remains of Chinese victims scattered throughout Japan, and to solemnly send these remains back to China. The first step of the committee was to collect the remains of the Chinese martyrs who were abused and murdered in the "Hanaoka Massacre" from the Japanese government. On March 15, the committee sent a delegation of ten people from Tokyo to Hanaoka to bring back the remains of 418 Chinese martyrs. The committee also held a memorial service for the Chinese martyrs and workers in Akita on March 25, and then transported the remains from Akita to Tokyo on the 27th.

Currently, the committee is negotiating with the Japanese government to prepare to send 561 remains of Chinese martyrs from Hanaoka and other regions back to China.
Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and other people's organizations sent a telegram on April 1 to the Japanese Red Cross, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Liaison Office of the Japan-China Friendship Association, forwarded to the Japanese "Memorial Meeting for the Chinese Martyrs of Hanaoka," expressing gratitude to the peace-loving Japanese people. The telegram reads as follows:

Today, at the memorial meeting for the Chinese martyrs of Hanaoka held in Tokyo, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the peace-loving Japanese people.

The Hanaoka incident once again exposes the extremely cruel and bloody crimes of the Japanese militarists, proving that Japanese militarism is not only the enemy of the Chinese people but also the enemy of the Japanese people. May the Chinese people and the peace-loving Japanese people fight together against the revival of Japanese militarism, against the war conspiracies of American imperialism, and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

The spirit of the Chinese martyrs of Hanaoka is immortal!

Long live the unity and friendship between the Chinese people and the peace-loving Japanese people!

The telegram reads as follows:

Glory to the martyrs who sacrificed heroically for China's liberation and independence, for peace in Asia, and against Japanese militarism. The Chinese people deeply appreciate the friendship and humanitarian spirit shown by the peace-loving Japanese people in searching for the remains of the martyrs. We firmly believe that the cooperation and efforts of the Chinese people and the peace-loving Japanese people will surely eliminate the threat of war deepened by the resurgence of Japanese militarism manipulated by American aggressors. Long live peace and friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people!
