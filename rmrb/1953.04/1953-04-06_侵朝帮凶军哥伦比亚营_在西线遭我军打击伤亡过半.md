Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 4th: Our reporter Zhang Tao reports: The accomplice army – the Colombian Battalion – under the command of the US military in Korea has recently suffered severe blows from our army in the battles on the Western Front, with more than half of its personnel killed or wounded.

　　On March 10th, two companies of the Colombian Battalion, driven by the US 7th Division, attacked our army's positions southeast of Sangpu Defense. They launched eight consecutive assaults, all of which were heroically repelled by our army. Our army's excellent 60mm mortar gunners and mortar gunners often allowed the invading enemy to approach within tens of meters of our army's positions, and then used accurate artillery shells to bombard the enemy, causing heavy casualties. In the battle on the 10th, the enemy suffered more than 150 casualties. This was already a significant loss for the small Colombian Battalion.

　　Five days after this battle, the Colombian Battalion was transferred to "Terrible Baldy Mountain," where thousands of American soldiers had already been buried, to replace the US 7th Division troops who had suffered five heavy blows from our army on this mountain. On March 23rd, the eighth day after the Colombian Battalion ascended "Baldy Mountain," our army launched its sixth attack on "Baldy Mountain," wiping out one reinforced company and one reinforced platoon of the Colombian Battalion. In these two battles, the Colombian Battalion suffered more than 500 casualties, accounting for more than half of its total strength.

　　Captured soldiers of the Colombian Battalion said that this battle was the most devastating loss the battalion had suffered since arriving in Korea in June 1951. The prisoners said with indignation: "American millionaires want to make a fortune, so they bring Colombians here as scapegoats. This is a war that has nothing to do with us!" Some Colombian soldiers raised their hands and surrendered to our army after our army stormed the mountain. They said: "We want to go home and don't want to work for American millionaires."

    侵朝帮凶军哥伦比亚营
    在西线遭我军打击伤亡过半
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社记者张涛报道：在侵朝美军指挥下的帮凶军——哥伦比亚营最近在西线的战斗中连续遭到我军的严重打击，已伤亡一半以上。
    三月十日，哥伦比亚营的两个连曾在美军第七师驱使下向上浦防东南山的我军阵地进犯，他们连续进行了八次冲锋，都被我军英勇击退。我军优秀的六零炮手和迫击炮手经常把进犯敌军放到接近我军阵地几十公尺的地方，然后用准确的炮弹轰击敌人，使敌军遭到惨重杀伤。在十日这天的战斗中，敌军伤亡了一百五十多名。对于小小的哥伦比亚营来说，这已是重大的损失了。
    在这次战斗以后的第五天，哥伦比亚营又被调到已经埋葬过数千名美军的“可怕的老秃山”上来，接替原在这座山上遭受了我军五次沉重打击的美军第七师的部队。哥伦比亚营登上“老秃山”后的第八天即三月二十三日，我军对“老秃山”发起了第六次攻击，消灭了哥伦比亚营的一个加强连和一个加强排。在这两次战斗中，哥伦比亚营的伤亡已达五百多名，占总人数的一半以上。
    被俘虏的哥伦比亚营的士兵们说，这次战斗是该营从一九五一年六月到朝鲜以来，遭到的一次最惨重的损失。俘虏们愤懑地说：“美国富翁要发财，把哥伦比亚人弄来当替死鬼，这是一场和我们毫不相干的战争！”有些哥伦比亚士兵在我军攻上山头以后，就举手向我军投降，他们说：“我们想回家，不想给美国富翁卖命。”
