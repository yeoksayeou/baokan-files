The CPC Hebei Provincial Committee Issues Directive on Regularly Publicizing and Implementing the Marriage Law

The movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law in Hebei Province concluded successfully on April 15th. Before its conclusion, the province not only dispatched working groups to various regions for inspection but also summoned the directors of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Offices and group leaders from six counties, including Longguan, Laiyuan, and Fangshan, to the province to report on the gains, experiences, and problems of the movement. Meetings were also convened with relevant departments such as the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation to study methods for regularly publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law. In response to the situation in various regions, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee issued a "Directive on Regularly Publicizing and Implementing the Marriage Law" on April 17th.

The directive first assessed the achievements of the movement: After widespread publicity, the Marriage Law became a household name in general rural areas, factories, and neighborhoods, and the broad masses of people understood the benefits of implementing the Marriage Law. In one-third to one-quarter of the key villages across the province, especially in the more than five thousand key villages, the following was basically achieved: (1) Village cadres, Party members, and League members ideologically distinguished between the new and old marriage systems, actively took the lead in implementing the Marriage Law, supported free marriage, and persuaded parents of arranged marriages; (2) The broad masses of people recognized the benefits of free marriage and were happy to implement the Marriage Law; (3) Cadres and the masses actively intervened in serious crimes involving murder and bodily harm and automatically resolved their own family problems, thereby powerfully encouraging people's enthusiasm for production and learning.

The directive particularly pointed out that the feudal ideas that have remained in people's minds for thousands of years cannot be completely eliminated through a single movement. This movement merely established some positions for future implementation of the Marriage Law, provided some experience, and laid the foundation for long-term implementation. Therefore, after the movement ends, all regions must continue to regularly implement the Marriage Law in the production movement.

Regarding the methods for regularly implementing the Marriage Law, the directive stipulates:

First, Party committees at all levels should, through summarizing the experiences and lessons of the movement, commending organizations and individuals who care about the freedom of marriage of the masses and support just struggles, and studying plans for regularly implementing the Marriage Law, ensure that cadres at all levels understand the importance of regularly implementing the Marriage Law and can correctly grasp and publicize marriage policies. For serious lawbreakers who commit murder or bodily harm, they must proactively inspect and intervene and resolve the issues in accordance with the law. For ordinary civil issues such as quarrels between couples and in-laws, early marriage, child brides, and property disputes, as long as the parties do not report them, they should not be proactively interfered with, but publicity and education must be carried out to persuade the masses to change these unhealthy phenomena.

Second, promote relevant departments to establish systems to ensure the regular implementation of the Marriage Law: All departments above the district level, such as culture and education, judicial, civil affairs, and people's organizations, should formulate practical implementation plans based on their own scope of work, incorporate them into their long-term plans, and implement them thoroughly after approval by the Party committee at the same level. In order to give full play to the role of various relevant organizations, regular liaison should be carried out with the Women's Federation at all levels as the center, under the guidance of Party and government leading organs: Leaders at the special district, city, county, district, factory, and mine levels should study the situation and problems in implementing the Marriage Law at least once every four months, while provincial-level departments should study it once every six months, and organize a province-wide inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law before each "March 8th" International Women's Day.

Third, in grassroots units such as streets and villages, the Marriage Law should be regularly implemented through the following methods: (1) Village cadres should actively intervene in criminal acts involving murder and bodily harm. For serious family disputes over marriage issues, they should properly mediate and resolve them in accordance with the Party's policies; (2) Education on the Marriage Law should be regularly conducted among members of organizations such as the Communist Youth League, the Trade Union, and the Women's Federation, especially through publicity using examples of free marriage; (3) Marriage Law courses should be added to the political courses in people's schools; (4) Relevant departments should establish and maintain a regular or irregular liaison system for studying the implementation of the Marriage Law.

Fourth, improving the marriage registration system and correctly handling marriage registration work is an important task to ensure freedom of marriage: Within this year, each special district and city should conduct a short-term special training for marriage registration personnel to enable them to correctly understand the Marriage Law and conscientiously carry out registration work.

Fifth, mobilizing women to actively participate in production, learning, and various tasks of national construction is the fundamental issue for achieving equality between men and women and liberating women, and it is also one of the important goals of implementing the Marriage Law. Therefore, in the work of regularly implementing the Marriage Law, we must encourage the broad masses of women to tap their potential and actively participate in various undertakings of production, learning, and national construction.

    中共河北省委发出经常宣传贯彻婚姻法工作指示
    河北省宣传贯彻婚姻法运动，截至四月十五日，已全部胜利结束。结束前，省除派工作组分赴各地检查外，又调龙关、涞源、房山等六县贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室主任及一工作组组长来省汇报运动的收获、经验和问题，并召集省工会、青年团、妇联会等有关部门会议，研究经常宣传贯彻婚姻法的方法。针对各地情况，中共河北省委于四月十七日发出“关于经常宣传贯彻婚姻法工作的指示”。
    指示首先估计了运动的成绩：经过普遍广泛地宣传后，在一般农村、工厂、街道中做到了家喻户晓，广大群众知道了实行婚姻法的好处；全省在三分之一到四分之一的重点片村内，特别是五千多个重点村内，基本上作到：（一）村干部、党员、团员在思想上划清了新旧婚姻的界限，积极带头执行婚姻法，支持自由婚姻，说服包办婚姻的家长；（二）广大人民群众认清了自由婚姻的好处，乐于执行婚姻法；（三）干部和群众主动干涉杀害人命、伤害人身的严重犯罪行为，自动解决自己的家庭问题，因而有力鼓舞了人们的生产与学习热情。
    指示中特别指出：几千年来遗留在人们头脑中的封建思想绝不是经过一个运动就可以完全清除的。此次运动只不过是为今后贯彻婚姻法建立了若干阵地，提供了一些经验，为长期贯彻打下了基础。因此，运动结束后各地仍必须把贯彻婚姻法工作在生产运动中经常持续下去。
    关于经常贯彻婚姻法工作的方法，指示中规定：
    第一，各级党委应通过总结运动的经验教训、表扬关心群众婚姻自由、支持正义斗争的组织与个人、研究经常贯彻婚姻法的计划等方法，使各级干部懂得经常贯彻婚姻法的重要性，能够正确地掌握和宣传婚姻政策：对于杀害人命、伤害人身的严重犯法分子，必须主动检查干涉并依法解决；对于一般夫妇、婆媳吵架、早婚、童养媳以及财产纠纷等普通民事问题，只要当事人不告发，就不应主动去干涉，但必须进行宣传教育，说服群众改变这些不健康的现象。
    第二，推动各个有关部门，订立制度，保证婚姻法的经常贯彻：区以上各级文教、司法、民政、人民团体等各部门，均应根据本身工作范围，制订切实可行的贯彻计划，列入自己的长年计划之中，并经同级党委批准，彻底执行。为了发挥各个有关组织的作用，应以各级妇联为中心，在党政领导机关指导下进行定期的联系：专区、市、县、区以及厂、矿各级领导至少每四个月研究一次贯彻婚姻法的情况和问题，省级各部门则应每半年研究一次，并于每年“三八”节前组织一次全省范围的关于婚姻法执行情况的检查。
    第三，在街、村等基层单位，应通过以下方法经常贯彻婚姻法：（一）村干部应主动干涉杀害人命、伤害人身的犯罪行为。对于婚姻问题上的严重家庭纠纷，应根据党的政策妥善地进行调解与解决；（二）在青年团、工会、妇联等团体成员中，经常进行婚姻法的教育，特别是通过自由婚姻的范例进行宣传；（三）在民校政治课中加入婚姻法课程；（四）各有关部门建立与坚持定期或不定期的研究贯彻婚姻法的联系制度。
    第四，健全婚姻登记制度，正确办理婚姻登记工作，是保障婚姻自由的一项重要工作：今年内各专区、市应将婚姻登记人员进行一次短期的专门训练，使其正确的领会婚姻法，认真进行登记工作。
    第五，发动广大妇女积极参加生产、学习和祖国建设的各项工作，是实现男女平等，解放妇女的根本问题，也是贯彻婚姻法的重要目的之一；因此在经常贯彻婚姻法的工作中，必须鼓舞广大妇女发掘自己的潜在力量，积极参加生产学习和祖国建设的各项事业。  （李殿隆）
