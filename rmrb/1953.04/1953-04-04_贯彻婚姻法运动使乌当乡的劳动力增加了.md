The work of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law in Wudang Township, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, has ended, and the mountain village is filled with joy. Women who have been freed from the shackles of the feudal marriage system, encouraged by their parents-in-law, husbands, and parents, have walked out of their homes and happily participated in social activities and productive labor. In those terraced fields, among the golden rapeseed flowers and tender green wheat fields, men and women are working enthusiastically. A five-mile-long road winds from the Nanshan slope to Wudang Street, along which people are constantly moving, busily digging ditches—building the largest-scale Nanshan water conservancy project in the township. Hundreds of women are working alongside men, carrying earth and building dikes.

The faces of the masses in Wudang Township are filled with happy joy. Whether men, women, old, or young, as long as they mention the Marriage Law, they can all talk about the benefits of the "Marriage Law."

Gao Xinchen, chairman of the township farmers' association and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, happily told us, "When the township publicized the Marriage Law last December (lunar calendar), I thought it was meddling and would hinder the central work. Now I know that publicizing the Marriage Law has further mobilized women and promoted the township's various central tasks."

Gao Xinchen pointed to the fields opposite and introduced the customs of Wudang Township to us. He said, "In the past, women simply did not go to the fields to produce. This is our local custom. Women do not do field work, only housework, at most growing some vegetables in the garden. They rarely participate in social activities. Otherwise, people will scold them as 'wild mountain women' or 'horse women'. Even during the drought resistance work last year, only a minority of women participated in field labor and social activities. Now you see, these rapeseed and wheat fields are all hoed by women. They also participate in digging ditches, opening ponds, and various activities in the township. This is really a great happy event."

In the past, when Zhao Shukuai and other mutual aid groups in Zhaojia Village assessed work and recorded points, the highest score for women was only half that of men. Therefore, the women in the village were unwilling to join the mutual aid groups. Through the publicity and education of the Marriage Law, the men in the village have realized that equal pay for equal work for men and women is inequality between men and women and the feudal idea of male superiority over women. Then, the mutual aid groups in the village consciously corrected this. Now, twenty women in the village have joined the mutual aid groups. At present, many women in Wudang Township have joined the mutual aid groups, and their enthusiasm for production is very high. The eight newly joined women in Gao Changying's mutual aid group in Maimang Village have also made a production plan and unanimously proposed to guarantee that they will learn to cut seedlings, transplant seedlings, and weed in this year's field production, and resolutely break the feudal superstition that "if women go to the fields, there will be three years of drought." Not long ago, Maimang Village jointly opened a pond, and more than thirty women in the village participated in the labor. The women not only carried earth to build the pond, but also went into the pond to bail out water. Young women Shi Kuanrong and Yang Yucui recalled the past and said, "In the past, how could a young girl be willing to bail water and repair ponds with her feet and hands covered in mud! At that time, if it were like this now, someone would definitely scold, whose daughter is so 'yiba' (meaning不懂规矩、作风不正派, doesn't understand the rules, has an improper style)." Farmer Gao Mingde then said, "Now everyone knows the benefits of the Marriage Law. Just talking about opening this pond, if it weren't for the women's participation, it would take at least five more days for the men alone."

The result of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law in Wudang Township is not only that it has promoted women's active participation in labor production, but it has also brought new changes in the marriage and family relations of farmers. New types of families with free marriage, democracy and harmony, and unity in production have emerged in large numbers, and many estranged couples have also reconciled. Chen Zhengyin and his wife, Ms. Lu, had not lived together or spoken to each other for twenty years. After reconciling through the Marriage Law movement, the couple now engages in production together every day, and they also go to the farmers' association meetings together in the evening, talking and laughing, very affectionate. Li Suzhen, who recently became pregnant after reconciling with her estranged husband, has been actively helped by her husband, Deng Haiyun, in carrying water and doing housework. Deng Haiyun also repeatedly told Li Suzhen to take good care of her body and not allow her to do heavy work. Li Suzhen is very grateful and said that this is entirely the happiness brought to her by the Marriage Law.

During the movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law in Wudang Township, a total of 57 disputes between couples, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, or other family disputes were resolved. The masses have generally consciously formulated family unity, love for the country, and production covenants. When we visited several villages in Wudang Township, we could see everywhere the new atmosphere of democracy and harmony among the "enemy couples" and "bad mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law" who had changed their relationships. On March 16, when we visited Shuitang Village, an old woman in her forties, Xu Bomu, said with a smile to us: "After publicizing the Marriage Law, the village has become quiet. The four families in the village who were famous for fighting and quarreling have completely reconciled. They have all formulated family unity, love for the country, and production covenants." The elderly people who had resisted, doubted, and feared the Marriage Law in the past have changed their understanding after receiving Marriage Law education, and especially appreciated the benefits of the Marriage Law. Parents have also changed their old attitudes towards their children's marriages. The old lady Xiong Suzhen said kindly to her daughter: "In the future, I will never arrange your marriage." Young men and women all understand that they should carefully choose their lovers in production, study, and work.

### 贯彻婚姻法运动使乌当乡的劳动力增加了

    贯彻婚姻法运动使乌当乡的劳动力增加了
    任承华　邓锡球
    贵州省贵筑县乌当乡宣传贯彻婚姻法工作结束了，山村洋溢着一片欢欣的景象。摆脱了封建婚姻制度枷锁的妇女，在公婆、丈夫和父母的勉励下，走出了大门，愉快地参加了社会活动和生产劳动。在那一丘一丘的田坝上，在那金黄色的油菜花丛中和嫩绿的麦田里，男子和妇女在热情地劳动着。从南山大坡蜿蜒至乌当街，是一条五里长的道路，沿途人群川流不息，正在紧张地挖沟——兴修全乡规模最大的南山水利工程。成百的妇女，同男人一道在那里忙着抬土、砌堤。
    乌当乡群众的脸上，都流露着幸福的喜悦。不管男女老少只要提起婚姻法，都可以讲一遍“婚姻法”的好处。
    乡农民协会主席、团支部书记高鑫臣高兴地对我们说：“去年十二月（旧历）乡里宣传婚姻法，我认为是多事，会妨碍中心工作，现在才晓得宣传婚姻法，进一步地发动了妇女，推动了乡里的各项中心工作。”
    高鑫臣一面指着对面的田坝，一面向我们介绍了乌当乡的风俗习惯。他说：“从前妇女根本不下田生产。这是我们地方的风俗，妇女不做田里活，只做家务事，最多种点吃菜的园子，很少参加社会活动。否则人家就会骂她们是‘山蛮婆’或‘儿马婆’。就是去年防旱抗旱时，妇女参加田间劳动同社会活动的都还是少数。现在你们看，这一片油菜同麦田都是妇女薅刨的。她们还参加挖沟开塘和乡里的各种活动，真是件大大的喜事。”
    赵家庄赵树奎等互助组，过去评工记分时，妇女最高的分数才到男的一半，因而庄上的妇女都不愿参加互助组。通过婚姻法的宣传教育，庄上的男人都已认识到男女同工不同酬，这就是男女不平等，男尊女卑的封建思想。接着庄上的互助组都自觉地进行了纠正，现在庄上已有二十个妇女参加了互助组。目前，乌当乡的妇女很多都加入了互助组，生产劲头很大。麦穰村高昌嬴互助组新参加的八个妇女，还订出了生产计划，一致提出保证要在今年下田生产中，学会割秧青，插秧薅秧等活路，坚决打破“妇女下田、天旱三年”的封建迷信思想。不久以前，麦穰村伙开了一口水塘，全村三十多个妇女都参加了劳动。妇女们不但抬土筑塘，还下到塘中戽水。青年妇女石宽荣、杨玉翠回忆过去时说：“先前大姑娘那个肯来捞脚挽手地戽水修塘啊！那时，照现在这样，准有人骂，谁家的姑娘这样‘义巴’（不懂规矩、作风不正派的意思）。”农民高明德就接过来说：“现在大家才晓得婚姻法的好处。单讲开这口塘，要不是妇女参加，单靠男人起码也得多干五天。”
    乌当乡宣传贯彻婚姻法的结果，不单推动了妇女积极参加劳动生产，在农民的婚姻与家庭关系上，也起了新的变化。自由婚姻，民主和睦，团结生产的新型家庭大量出现，许多怨偶也都重新和好。陈正银和妻子鲁氏，已经二十年没有同居，也没有说话，通过婚姻法运动和好后，夫妻二人每天一道搞生产，晚上又一同上农会开会，有说有笑，非常亲热。由怨偶和好的李素贞最近怀了孕，丈夫邓海云就主动帮助她挑水做家务事。邓海云还再三嘱咐李素贞要保养好身体，不许素贞做笨重活。李素贞十分感激，她说这完全是婚姻法给她带来的幸福。
    乌当乡在宣传贯彻婚姻法运动中，共解决夫妻、婆媳或其他家庭纠纷五十七起。群众普遍自觉地订立了家庭团结爱国生产公约。当我们去访问乌当乡的几个村寨时，处处可以看到已经改变了关系的“冤家夫妻”、“恶劣婆媳”之间民主和睦的新气象。三月十六日我们访问水塘寨时，一位四十多岁的徐伯妈就笑着向我们述说：“宣传了婚姻法，寨子变清静了。过去寨上打架吵嘴有名的四户人家，完全和好了。他们都订了家庭团结爱国生产公约。”过去对婚姻法抱抗拒、怀疑、恐惧态度的老年人，在接受婚姻法教育后，改变了认识，特别体会到婚姻法的好处。父母们也改变了对儿女婚姻大事的老态度。老婆婆熊素贞亲切地对女儿说：“今后我决不会包办你的婚姻。”青年男女都懂得要在生产、学习、工作中慎重地选择自己的爱人。
