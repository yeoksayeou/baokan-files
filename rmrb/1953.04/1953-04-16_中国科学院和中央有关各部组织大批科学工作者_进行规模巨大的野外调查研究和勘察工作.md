Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Railways and other departments of the Central People's Government have organized a large number of scientific workers to conduct field surveys, research, and exploration in various regions, covering biology, water conservancy, soil, geography, and other fields. Some survey teams departed at the end of March, and other teams will go to the field soon.

The survey teams organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences will carry out larger-scale work. In order to understand plant resources, plant properties, plant distribution patterns, and to solve soil utilization issues in various parts of China, survey teams mainly from the Institute of Botany and the Institute of Soil Science will collect data in Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guangdong. Regarding soil, the focus is on studying the further utilization of red soil wasteland. Regarding plants, preparations are underway to start from Guangxi and begin compiling a national plant distribution map. The Mammalian Group of the Institute of Zoology will delve into the Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeast China to study the types, distribution, living environment, habits, protection, and breeding of mammals. The Ornithology Group of the Institute of Zoology will study the protection of beneficial birds, the elimination of harmful birds, and their distribution in the fruit-producing areas of northern Hebei Province. The Institute of Entomology will cooperate with existing locust control methods to study further eradication of locust plagues. The Institute of Hydrobiology will conduct large-scale surveys of lakes in Hubei Province and research and investigate fish disease prevention and control in fish farming areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. Hubei Province is the most concentrated region of lakes in China, with more than a thousand large and small lakes scattered throughout the province. However, only a few have been used for fish farming. In order to tap this huge potential, the Institute of Hydrobiology will begin surveying the main lakes of the province in 1953, providing data for utilizing and improving the lakes to develop fish farming. The Qingdao Marine Biology Research Laboratory of the Institute and the Institute of Zoology, jointly with the Central Fisheries Experimental Institute, the Shandong Aquatic Products Company, and the Department of Zoology of Shandong University, will conduct surveys and research on fish in the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea.

In addition, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Institute of Botany, Institute of Soil Science, and Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly organized the Yellow River Survey Team to investigate the Yellow River and study how to transform the Yellow River and solve the Yellow River sediment problem through soil and water conservation. The Ministry of Water Resources and the Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly organized a survey team to investigate water conservancy issues in the Han River Basin. To cooperate with the Northwest construction, the Ministry of Railways and the Institute of Geography of the Academy of Sciences organized a survey team to conduct investigations in the Northwest and study the local economic geography. In order to better prepare for the forage varieties needed for the grass-crop rotation system, the Institute of Genetics and Crop Breeding of the Academy of Sciences and the North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences are cooperating, with the mountainous area of Xiaowutai in Chahar Province as the survey and collection center.

Many scientific workers participated in these field surveys, such as botanist Zhang Zhaoxi, ichthyologists Wu Xianwen and Zhang Chunlin, zoologists Tong Dizhou and Shou Zhenhuang, hydrobotanist Rao Qin, planktonologists Zhu Shuping and Ni Dashu, soil scientists Song Daquan, Xiong Yi, and Feng Zhaolin, ornithologist Zheng Zuoxin, entomologist Ma Shijun, geographer Huang Bingwei, etc.

Such large-scale comprehensive field survey work has never been done before liberation. The new China has opened up infinitely broad avenues for scientific undertakings.

    中国科学院和中央有关各部组织大批科学工作者
    进行规模巨大的野外调查研究和勘察工作
    【新华社十四日讯】中国科学院和中央人民政府水利、林业、农业、铁道等部门组织了大批科学工作者，到各地进行生物、水利、土壤、地理等方面的野外调查研究和勘察工作。有些调查队已在三月底出发，其他各队也将在最近陆续到现场去工作。
    中国科学院组织的调查队将进行规模较大的工作。为了了解我国各地植物资源、植物性质、植物分布规律和解决土壤利用问题，以植物、土壤研究所为主的调查队到广西、云南、广东搜集资料。土壤方面，着重研究红壤荒地的进一步利用问题。植物方面，准备从广西开始，着手绘制全国植物分布图。动物研究室的哺乳动物组，深入东北小兴安岭林区研究哺乳动物的种类、分布、生活环境、生活习性以及保护繁殖等问题。该室鸟类组在河北省北部果区研究益鸟的保护、害鸟的除防以及分布情况。昆虫研究所配合现有治蝗方法研究进一步根除蝗灾。水生生物研究所将进行大规模的湖北省湖泊调查和江苏、浙江、广东三省养鱼区鱼病防治研究和调查。湖北省是我国湖群最集中的地区，大小湖泊一千多个星罗棋布，但已经利用养鱼的为数不多，为了发掘这一巨大的潜在力量，水生生物研究所在一九五三年着手调查全省主要湖泊，提供利用湖泊改良湖泊来发展养鱼事业的资料。该所青岛海洋生物研究室及动物研究室联合中央水产试验所、山东水产公司和山东大学动物系进行黄海、渤海鱼类的调查研究。
    此外，水利部、农业部、林业部和中国科学院植物、土壤、地理各研究所联合组织黄河勘察队，勘察黄河情况，研究从水土保持来改造黄河解决黄河泥沙问题。水利部和中国科学院地理研究所联合组织调查队调查汉水流域的水利问题。为了配合西北建设，铁道部和科学院地理研究所组织调查队到西北进行调查，研究当地的经济地理。为了更好地准备草田轮作制所需要的牧草品种，科学院遗传栽培研究室和华北农业科学研究所合作，以察北小五台一带山地为调查及采集中心。
    许多科学工作者参加这些野外调查工作，如植物学家张肇骞，鱼类学家伍献文、张春霖，动物学家童第周、寿振黄，水生植物学家饶钦止，浮游生物学家朱树屏、倪达书，土壤学家宋达泉、熊毅、冯兆林，鸟类学家郑作新，昆虫学家马世骏，地理学家黄秉维等。
    像这样规模巨大的综合性的野外调查工作，在解放以前是从来没有过的。新中国为科学事业开辟了无限广阔的道路。
