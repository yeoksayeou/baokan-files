    Supporting the Malayan People's Struggle for Freedom
    Indian People Regularly Hold "Malaya Day"
    Xinhua News Agency: The All-India Peace Council recently called for the holding of "Malaya Day" on April 18th to express the Indian people's sympathy and support for the Malayan people who are struggling for freedom. Mass rallies will be held on this day, which will pay special attention to the issue of recruiting Gurkha soldiers for the British army in Malaya. Recruitment stations in India have been officially closed. This is a major victory for the Indian peace movement. However, the British army still receives the convenience of Gurkha soldiers recruited to Malaya transiting through India.
    The Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Council, at a meeting held in February, called for a movement demanding that the Indian government "order the immediate closure of Gurkha military camps and declare that it will no longer provide transit facilities in India to the British army." The All-India Peace Council has called on local peace committees to seek the support of various parties, factions, and important non-party figures for this movement.

    支持马来亚人民争取自由的斗争
    印度人民定期举行“马来亚日”
    据新华社讯：全印和平理事会最近号召在四月十八日举行“马来亚日”，以表示印度人民对正在为争取自由而斗争的马来亚人民的同情和支持。这一天将举行群众集会，这些集会将特别注意替在马来亚的英国军队招募廓尔喀士兵的问题。印度境内的招募站已经正式关闭。这是印度和平运动的大胜利。但是英国军队仍旧得到被招募到马来亚去的廓尔喀士兵在印度过境的便利。
    全印和平理事会常务委员会在二月举行的会议上曾号召进行一个运动，要求印度政府“下令立刻封闭廓尔喀军营，宣布不再给予英国军队在印度的过境便利。”全印和平理事会已经号召各地的和平委员会争取各党各派和重要的无党无派人士对这个运动的支持。
