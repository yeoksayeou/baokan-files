Party Committees in Various Regions Correctly Implement the Central Rectification Policy
The Awareness of the Vast Number of Rural Party Members is Generally Enhanced

    Since the Chinese Communist Party's First National Organizational Work Conference, over 75,000 rural Party grassroots organizations nationwide have undergone rectification, with over 1.2 million Party members participating. After rectification, the class consciousness of rural Party members has significantly improved, and the outlook of rural work has been refreshed.

    The past two years of rectification experience have proven that, after education and review, 90% of the Chinese Communist Party's rural Party members meet the standards or can reach the standards of a Party member. Bad elements expelled from the Party and those who voluntarily withdrew or were advised to withdraw because they did not meet the standards accounted for approximately 10%. The vast majority of rural Party members correctly implemented the Party and government's policies in rural areas and actively completed various work tasks. In various struggles, they proved to be steadfast, closely connected with the masses, and conscious and excellent members. This is the main aspect of the rural Party. However, on the other hand, there are also some shortcomings, and some of these are quite serious. This is reflected in the fact that, after land reform, under the influence of the spontaneous development of capitalist factors in the small-peasant economy, some Party members, due to unclear understanding of the direction of rural economic development, have gradually fostered serious phenomena such as a rich-peasant mentality, indifference to politics, individual farming, and the pursuit of wealth through exploitation. Some Party members believed that the revolution had been completed, so they buried themselves in individual production and were unwilling to organize; others, although participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, had their mutual aid and cooperation reduced to mere formality due to the existence and development of erroneous thinking. Unhealthy Party work styles, including commandism, corruption, degeneration, and violations of laws and discipline, as well as impure organizations, also existed seriously. In this rectification, various regions resolutely followed the Central Committee's established policy, and while conducting universal education on Party member standards, they focused on conducting education on the future, the relationship between individual and overall interests, and the mass line. They openly exposed and corrected shortcomings in Party organizations, raising those who did not fully meet the standards to essentially meet the standards. Those bad elements who had infiltrated the Party were expelled, and those who did not meet the standards at all were, in addition to those who voluntarily withdrew, advised to withdraw.

    Through this rectification, all Party members improved and transformed themselves according to the standards, further purifying and improving our Party ideologically, organizationally, and in terms of work style. First, the vast majority of rural Party members, after rectification and education, recognized the bright prospects of communism, clarified their goals, and strengthened their communist worldview. Before the rectification, many Party members believed that seizing power meant the end of the revolution, and they became passive and stopped working. Some Party members in the Huaiyin area of Jiangsu even said: "Now that the task of fighting Japan and distributing land has been completed, what do we need Party members for?" Feng Buge of Yantuo Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi, said: "Now I have a good wife, live in a brick house, have been allocated good land, wear foreign clothes, cover myself with fancy satin, eat noodles every other day, and play with electricity; life is so good, why bother realizing communism?" After education on the future, introducing the situation of agricultural production and the lives of collective farmers in the Soviet Union, Party members who were previously satisfied with the status quo self-criticized: "We really have the eyes of a rat and can't see far; our countryside doesn't even have tractors or cinemas yet, so how can we say life is so good!" Party members who used to bury themselves in individual production now also realize: "Soviet collective farmers can cultivate more than 500 mu of land a day with a tractor. We use curved plows, carry baskets to plant seeds, and our two legs (people) and four legs (livestock) run dozens of miles a day, tiring us out with sore backs and aching legs, and we can only cultivate three or four mu at most; if we don't organize, we won't be able to do this in a day even after several lifetimes." Some Party members in mountainous areas of Shanxi Province used to believe that "tractors can't climb up bare mountains, and communism can't be realized," and even wanted to move to the plains. Once they understood the principle of mankind conquering nature in a communist society, that timid emotion of wanting to move out of the mountains turned into a tenacious force for transforming nature. Hou Chunbao said: "Now it's like a frog in a well climbing to the top of the well, the mountainous areas also have a future." In short, after education on the future of communism, the vast majority of Party members strengthened their confidence in striving for the realization of communism. They said, "Now I know where I stand," "I have a bright future," and "The mention of communism fills me with energy."

    Secondly, rural Party members, after rectification and education, understood that to realize communism in China, they must organize and take the road of collectivization and cooperation, and that the capitalist-rich peasant road is impassable and dangerous. Party members in various regions consciously examined their thoughts and actions based on Party member standards and criticized rich-peasant thinking and exploitative behavior. According to statistics from Hebei Province among 49,164 Party members, 31 rented out land, 1,003 lent out money at usurious rates, 36 invested in private stores, and 31 had developed into rich peasants. For example, Sun Yuhe, a Party member of Gaoxu Village in Suqian, Jiangsu, bought 22 mu of land in less than a year after land reform; and lent wheat at a high interest rate during the lean season, demanding three dou of interest for every shi of grain lent out in just 20 days; and dragged a small stick to collect debts as soon as the wheat was harvested. This kind of behavior of taking the road of exploitation was severely criticized in the education on distinguishing between the old and new roads. Many Party members, after education, recognized that "organizing" is the only way to communism and actively participated in and led mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For example, Wang Weicai of Weichi Village in Wuxiang, Shanxi Province, resolutely refused to join a mutual aid group before the rectification and requested to withdraw from the Party. After realizing how to be a Communist Party member, he made a painful self-criticism and expressed to the Party: "This time the Party saved me, and I am determined to do a good job in the mutual aid group in the future." According to a survey in Shandong Province among 3,847 branches, Party members participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations before the rectification averaged about 30% of the total number of Party members, even in areas with a relatively solid foundation for mutual aid and cooperation work, it only accounted for 40% to 50%. After the rectification, the number of Party members participating in mutual aid groups increased by an average of one time. In general areas, it accounts for about 60% of the total number of Party members, and in areas with a relatively solid foundation for mutual aid and cooperation work, Party members have generally joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations. At the same time, the formalism in mutual aid and cooperation, as well as the impatient emotions of greed and rash advance, have also been criticized and corrected. Many Party members learned from this study that this kind of blindly developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, which only pursues formality and does not proceed from reality, is not feasible and will separate from the masses. The Dahe partnership group in the tenth district of Longjiang County, Heilongjiang, was criticized, and half of them were changed to permanent mutual aid groups. The development, reorganization, and consolidation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement directly strengthened the Party's leadership over agricultural production. According to statistics from several counties in Heilongjiang: 100 villages also made plans for increasing agricultural production during the rectification, and 11 typical villages were cultivated, and 16 backward villages were developed. It also correctly reversed the erroneous view of some Party members that individual interests were inconsistent with the overall interests of the Party. For example, Party member Yang Fengshan summarized his participation in mutual aid and cooperation over the years and realized that only by doing a good job in mutual aid and cooperation can the living standards of the masses be improved, and his own life can be improved. When they organized seasonal mutual aid groups, the income from grain was barely enough to eat; after changing to permanent mutual aid groups and using new farm tools, although the grain income increased, some farmers' torn cotton-padded jackets still could not be taken off; later, when agricultural production cooperatives were established, more grain was harvested, and everyone changed to new cotton-padded jackets. From this, they concluded: "Without mutual aid and cooperation, the peasants of the whole community would not be able to wear new cotton-padded jackets; only when everyone benefits can individuals benefit, and if you want to benefit yourself, you must first think of the benefit of everyone."

    Again, after this rural rectification, the forced commandism of some Party member cadres was universally criticized, and a mass line work style was established. In the past, the forced commandism of rural Party members was common and serious; 15% to 21% of Party members in rural Shanxi had forced commandism. For example, Yang Weihai, the secretary of the Baiyao Village branch in Pinding, announced at a mass meeting when organizing a mutual aid group: "Now I order everyone to join the mutual aid group, whoever doesn't join is not patriotic." The masses were very dissatisfied. When mobilizing farmers to sell grain to the state in the Northeast, the original policy was "buy more if there is a surplus, buy less if there is less, and don't buy if there is no surplus." At that time, the county ordered the district: "If this task is not completed, you will be responsible!" So the district and village cadres ordered down level by level, and finally the village cadres ordered the masses: regardless of whether there was a surplus of grain, it was apportioned equally by household. This forced commandism seriously undermined the policies of the Party and the government. Although some Party members also recognized that forced commandism was not good, they lacked confidence in how to follow the mass line, and they mistakenly believed that sometimes forced commandism was still a little useful; they said: "The task is urgent, the time is tight, you can't do it without force, the question is what things, what time, and what kind of people you use it on." After education combined with the eight conditions of Party member standards, the vast majority of Party members recognized that "forced commandism is the work style of the Kuomintang reactionaries, not the work style of the Communist Party"; "Forced commandism is more harmful than good", so the more urgent the task and the tighter the time, the more necessary it is to follow the mass line. Implementing the mass line is a magic weapon for doing good work, not only is it needed in everything, but it is also needed at all times. The Tianzhu Village branch in Shunyi, Hebei, combined the development of supply and marketing cooperative members with the education of the mass line. In the past, the village cadres of Tianzhu Village forced the development of members, and only developed 70 shares in two years; but this time, after adopting the working method of patiently persuading and educating the masses, 125 shares were developed in just two days. Party members reflected: "The mass line is really effective, and the task is completed quickly and well." Even the village chief, who had a very serious style of forced commandism in the past, said: "In the past, I thought that things wouldn't get done without forced commandism, but now I realize that the mass line is good." Party members in Heilongjiang, Songjiang and other provinces reviewed their forced commandism in front of the masses and expressed their determination to correct their bad work style, which was warmly welcomed by the masses.

    In the rural rectification across the country, a batch of bad elements who had infiltrated the Party were also purged, including: counter-revolutionaries, landlord and rich peasant elements, degenerate elements, and those who oppressed the masses and seriously violated laws and discipline. These bad elements had long been mixed up in the Party, even seizing leadership positions, wearing the guise of Communist Party members, bullying those above and suppressing those below, and committing all kinds of evil, making the atmosphere in some Party organizations unhealthy and right and wrong unclear; the enthusiasm of the vast number of rural Party members and the masses was suppressed and suffocated. In this rectification, those who had extremely low awareness and were unwilling to actively strive to be a Party member who met the standards were persuaded to withdraw from the Party; the Party organizations approved the requests of the very few who voluntarily requested to withdraw from the Party. Secondly, those who violated laws and discipline were given Party disciplinary action according to the severity of their circumstances and the degree of their self-examination and understanding of their mistakes. According to statistics from the first batch of rural rectification in Shaanxi, those who were expelled from the Party and those who voluntarily withdrew from the Party and were persuaded to withdraw from the Party accounted for 9.2% of the total number of Party members; those who received other punishments accounted for 2.3%. This guaranteed the purity of the Party organization, further enhanced the Party's prestige among the masses, and strengthened the Party's leadership over rural work.

    The reason why this rectification achieved the above results is that, first of all, the leading aspects of the Party at all levels conscientiously implemented the Central Committee's instructions to carry out rectification work in a planned, prepared, and led manner. The rectification preparation work of the Northwest, North China, East China, and Northeast Central Bureaus was all over one year. During this period, rectification work cadres were trained, typical experiments were conducted, and after gaining experience, they were carried out in batches. In the process of rectification, various regions generally attached importance to carrying out rectification work based on the inherent strength of the branch and on the basis of the conscious efforts of the local branch and Party members; at the same time, they closely combined it with rural production work, so that the rectification work and production work were properly combined. Secondly, regarding the integration of rectification education work, theory and practice, as the important key to rectification; in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, bad things were criticized in a timely manner, good things were praised, and role models were established; especially the leading cadres' leading self-criticism greatly encouraged the general Party members to carry out self-criticism and the courage to be determined to expose and correct mistakes. Again, due to the serious spirit adopted in organizational handling, the Party's discipline was accurately implemented. However, some places lacked strong leadership in rectification work, and the rectification policy was not well implemented, so that the rectification work did not achieve the due effect.

    After the end of the winter rural rectification, in order to consolidate the rectification results in a planned and perfect way, various regions have put forward methods to consolidate the rectification results. On the one hand, improve the organizational life of the branch, educate Party members to carry forward democracy well, and use criticism and self-criticism; pay special attention to cultivating the backbone members of the branch, so that they can often play a backbone core role in the branch; on the other hand, change the leadership style of the county and district committee leaders. The deployment of work should be specific, and the policies and practices should be explained. After the task is deployed, it is necessary to check frequently and give the township and village cadres more specific assistance. The current anti-bureaucracy struggle in various places will play a decisive role in improving the leadership style and consolidating the rectification results.

    各地党委正确执行中央整党方针
    广大农村党员觉悟普遍提高
    自中国共产党第一次全国组织工作会议以来，全国各地农村党的基层组织已有七万五千余个经过了整顿，参加整党的党员计有一百二十万余名。农村党员经过整党后，阶级觉悟有显著提高，农村工作面貌为之一新。
    过去两年的整党经验证明，经过教育审查的结果，中国共产党的农村党员百分之九十是符合党员标准和能够达到党员标准的，而被开除出党的坏分子和自愿退党及被劝告退党的不合党员标准的占百分之十左右。绝大部分的农村党员正确地执行了党与政府在农村中的政策，积极地完成了各项工作任务，在各种斗争中更证明他们是立场坚定，与群众联系密切，有觉悟的优秀分子。这是农村党的主要方面。但是，在另一方面，也存在着若干缺点，而且有些缺点是相当严重的。这表现在一部分党员在土地改革后，在小农经济自发地发展着资本主义因素的影响下，由于对农村经济发展方向不明确，而逐渐滋长着的富农思想、不问政治、个人单干、剥削致富的现象极为严重。有一部分党员认为革命已经完结，于是埋头个人生产，不愿意组织起来；有的虽然参加了互助合作的组织，但由于错误思想的存在与发展，使互助合作流于形式。而党内作风不正，甚至强迫命令、贪污蜕化、违法乱纪等组织不纯等现象也严重地存在着。在此次整党中，各地坚决地按照中央既定方针，在普遍对党员进行党员标准教育时，着重地对党员进行了前途教育，个人利益与整体利益以及群众路线等方面的教育，公开地揭发与纠正了党组织中的缺点，把不完全符合党员标准的提高到基本上符合党员标准。对于混进党内的坏分子则开除出党，对于完全不合于党员标准的，除自愿退党者外，则劝告他们退党。
    经过这次整党，所有党员都按照党员标准提高与改造了自己，使我们党在思想上、组织上、作风上都得到了进一步的纯洁与提高。首先表现在经过整党教育的农村党员，绝大部分是认清了共产主义美好远景，明确了奋斗目标，坚定了共产主义人生观。整党前有不少党员认为夺取了政权，就是革命完结，于是，有消极不干工作的。江苏淮阴地区部分党员甚至说：“现在抗日分土地的任务已经完成了，还要党员做什么。”山西平顺县烟驼村冯步阁就这样说：“咱如今娶了个好媳妇，住着砖瓦楼，分的是好地，穿的是洋布衣，盖的是花贡呢，隔天吃顿面，耍的手把电；日子过的美透啦，干啥还要实现共产主义。”经过前途教育，介绍了苏联农业生产情况及集体农民的生活情况后，过去满足现状的党员自我批评说：“咱真是老鼠的眼睛看不远；咱农村还没有拖拉机、电影院哩，那谈得上美透啦！”过去只顾埋头个人生产的党员，现在也认识到：
    “人家苏联集体农民，一架拖拉机一天就耕种五百多亩地，咱使弯勾犁，提着篮子点种，一天两条腿
    （人）和四条腿（牲口）跑几十里路，累得腰酸背痛，最多种了三、四亩地；如果不组织起来，干几辈子也干不出这一天来。”山西部分山区的党员，过去一向认为“光山秃岭，拖拉机上不去，实现不了共产主义”，甚至想搬到平原地区去。当他们一旦懂得了共产主义社会人类征服自然的道理后，那种打算搬出山区的怯懦情绪，就变成改造自然的顽强的力量了。侯春保说：“这下算是井底蛤蟆爬到井上来了，山区同样有前途。”总之，经过共产主义的前途教育，绝大部分的党员坚定了为实现共产主义而努力的信心。他们说“现在心里摸底了”，“心里亮堂有奔头了”，“一提起共产主义来，混身就来了劲”。
    其次表现在经过整党教育的农村党员，懂得了要在中国实现共产主义，必须组织起来，走合作化集体化的道路，而资本主义——富农道路是走不通的，是危险的。各地党员曾自觉地根据党员标准检查自己的思想和行动，批判了富农思想和剥削行为。据河北省在四万九千一百六十四个党员中的统计，其中出租土地的三十一人，放高利贷的一千零三人，向私人商店投资的三十六人，已发展成富农的三十一人。如江苏宿迁高圩村党员孙玉和，土地改革后一年不到，买了二十二亩地；并在青黄不接时放麦青，仅在二十天的时间，放出一石粮，即向债户讨三斗的利息；麦子收下来就拖着小棍讨债。这种走剥削道路的行为，在划清新旧两条道路的教育中，都一一受到了严厉的批判。许多党员经过教育认清了“组织起来”是走向共产主义的必由之路，积极参加和领导了互助合作组织。如山西省武乡苇池子村王维才，整党前坚决不参加互助组，并要求退党，在认识了怎样做一个共产党员后，沉痛地作了检讨，并向党表示：“这次党挽救了我，今后决心搞好互助组。”据山东省在三千八百四十七个支部中的调查，整党前参加互助合作组织的党员平均占党员总数的百分之三十左右，即在互助合作工作较有基础的地区，也只占百分之四十至五十。经过整党后，参加互助组的党员平均增加了一倍。一般地区占党员总数的百分之六十左右，在互助合作工作较有基础的地区，党员已普遍地加入了互助合作组织。同时对互助合作中存在的形式主义偏向，以及贪多冒进的急躁情绪，亦得到了批判和纠正。许多党员从这次学习中，认识了这种只追求形式、不从实际出发，盲目发展互助合作组织是行不通的，是会脱离群众的。黑龙江龙江县十区的大合伙组，经过批判，即有一半改成了常年互助组。由于互助合作运动的发展、整理与巩固，直接地加强了党对农业生产的领导。据黑龙江几个县统计：有一百个村在整党中还作了农业增产计划，并培养了十一个典型村，开辟了十六个落后村。其中也正确地扭转了某些党员认为个人利益与党的整体利益不一致的错误看法。如党员杨峰山把自己几年来参加互助合作小结了一下，认识到互助合作搞好了，群众生活水平才能提高，自己的生活才能改善。当他们组织季节性互助组时，收入的粮食勉强够吃；改成常年互助组，使用新式农具后，粮食收入虽然增加了，但有的农民的破棉袄仍然脱不下来；后来成立了农业生产合作社，粮食收得多了，每人都换了新棉袄。由此他们得出了结论：“没有互助合作，全社农民就穿不上新棉袄；有了大家的好处才有个人的好处，要想自己有好处，一定要先想到大家的好处。”
    再次，经过这次农村整党，各地普遍批判了某些党员干部的强迫命令作风，树立了群众路线的工作作风。过去，农村党员的强迫命令作风是普遍而严重的；山西农村党员中曾有百分之十五到二十一的党员，存在着强迫命令作风。如平定白窑村支部书记杨维海，组织互助组时曾在群众大会上宣布：“现在我命令大家参加互助组，谁不参加谁就不爱国。”群众很不满意。东北地区在动员农民把粮售给国家时，原订方针是“多余多购、少余少购，没有余粮就不收购”。当时，县给区下命令说：“这个任务完不成由你负责！”于是区、村干部就逐级命令下去，最后村干部命令群众：不问有无余粮，按户平均摊派。这种强迫命令的作风，严重地破坏了党和政府的政策。有些党员虽然也认识到强迫命令不好，但对如何走群众路线缺乏信心，他们错误地认为有时候强迫命令还有一点点用场；他们说：“任务急，时间紧，不强迫不行，问题看用在啥事情、啥时候、对啥样子的人身上。”经过了结合党员标准八项条件的教育，绝大部分的党员认识到“强迫命令是国民党反动派的作风，不是共产党的作风”；
    “强迫命令是成事不足败事有余”，所以越是任务急、时间紧，越要走群众路线。贯彻群众路线，是做好工作的活宝贝，不仅事事要它，而且时时要它。河北顺义天竺村支部，结合发展供销合作社社员，进行了群众路线的教育。过去天竺村村干部强迫命令发展社员，搞了两年只发展七十股；而这次采用了耐心说服教育群众的工作方法后，在短短的两天当中，就发展了一百二十五股。党员反映：“群众路线真灵，工作任务完成得又快又好。”即是过去强迫命令作风很严重的村长也说：“过去咱认为离开强迫命令就不治事，这下我认识到群众路线就是好。”黑龙江、松江等省党员在群众面前检讨了他们的强迫命令作风，并表示下决心改正坏作风，受到了群众的热烈欢迎。
    全国各地农村整党中，还清洗了一批混入党内的坏分子，其中包括：反革命分子，地主、富农分子，蜕化变质分子，欺压群众、严重违法乱纪分子等。这些坏分子长期混在党内，甚至窃据领导职位，披着共产党员的外衣，欺上压下、为非作歹，使党的某些组织内正气不伸，是非不明；广大农村党员与群众的积极性，受到压抑窒息。这次整党中，对于觉悟极低，又不肯积极为争取做一个符合标准的党员而努力的人，即劝其退党；对极少数自动提出请求退党的，党组织批准了他们的请求。其次对违法乱纪分子，视其情节轻重及对错误检查认识的程度，分别给予党的纪律处分。据陕西第一批农村整党的统计，开除出党和自动退党、被劝退党的占党员总数百分之九·二；受其他处分的占百分之二·三。这就保证了党组织的纯洁，进一步提高党在群众中的威信，加强了党对农村工作的领导。
    此次整党所以获得上述成果，首先是各级党的领导方面切实执行了中央有计划、有准备、有领导地进行整党工作的指示。西北、华北、华东、东北各中央局的整党准备工作都在一年以上，在这期间，训练了整党工作干部，进行了典型试验，并在取得经验后分批进行。在整党过程中，各地普遍重视了通过支部的内在力量，在当地支部、党员自觉的基础上进行整党工作；同时密切结合了农村的生产工作，使整党工作和生产工作恰当地结合进行。其次把整党教育工作、理论与实际相结合，看成是整党的重要关键；在开展批评与自我批评方面，及时批评了坏的、表扬了好的，树立了榜样；尤其是领导干部的带头检讨，大大地鼓舞了一般党员开展自我批评，决心揭发和改正错误的勇气。再次，由于各地在组织处理方面，采取了认真严肃的精神，准确地执行了党的纪律。但也有些地方对整党工作，缺乏坚强的领导，整党政策没有很好地贯彻，使整党工作没有达到应有的效果。
    在冬季农村整党结束后，为了有计划地完善地来巩固整党成果，各地已提出巩固整党成果的办法，一方面健全支部的组织生活，教育党员很好地发扬民主，运用批评与自我批评；特别注意培养支部的骨干分子，使其在支部内经常起骨干核心作用；另一方面改变县区委领导干部的领导作风。布置工作要具体，要交代政策和作法。在布置任务后，要勤于检查，多给乡村干部以具体的帮助。目前各地正在进行的反官僚主义斗争，对改进领导作风，巩固整党成果将会起决定性的作用。
