Spring sowing is now in full swing in North China, with drought-stricken areas rushing to sow while combating the drought. In Hebei Province, over 301,000 mu of millet, sorghum, corn, and beans have been planted in the Zhangjiakou and Tongxian Special Districts. In Neiqiu County, Xingtai Special District, over 50% of the millet has been sown, and cotton sowing has begun in Handan Special District and other areas. In Shanxi Province, after rainfall in early April, various areas immediately took advantage of the moisture to sow. Currently, Yongji County alone has completed 70% of its planned sowing area. After completing spring wheat sowing, the Mengsui region is now sowing corn, broad beans, flax, and naked oats. Zhaowuda League has sown over 50,000 mu. In the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin, approximately 60% of the farmland has been sown. However, the drought situation in various areas is extremely serious. In Hebei Province, over 15 million mu of land cannot be sown due to drought. On April 22nd, the province's Party and government leadership issued a call to urgently launch a drought-resistant sowing campaign, and organized 1,200 county and district cadres to go deep into the rural areas to inspect and promote this campaign. Areas with conditions to develop water conservancy are actively digging wells and opening canals to expand irrigation. Zhangjiakou Special District has irrigated over 534,000 mu of land and harrowed and hoed over 4.7 million mu to conserve moisture. In Tongxian Special District, Pinggu and Changping counties are starting construction on eight small canals, which can expand paddy fields by over 10,000 mu. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Tongliao County began diverting water from the Xiliao River in mid-March to irrigate over 160,000 mu. Moisture conservation work has also been carried out in general in drought-stricken areas of Suiyuan Province.

The leadership of spring plowing production in various parts of North China has been greatly strengthened. In early April, the CPC committees at all levels in North China organized cadres to carefully study the CPC Central Committee's instructions on spring plowing production and the CPC Central Committee North China Bureau's instructions on spring plowing production and other documents, clarifying the policies and ideas. More than 3,000 cadres from the provincial, special district, and county levels of Shanxi, Hebei, and Suiyuan provinces have gone to the countryside to help counties, districts, and villages properly arrange various tasks, ensuring that spring plowing production becomes the central task overriding everything else. At present, the blind and rash advancement tendencies in the mutual aid and cooperation movement have been basically corrected, the phenomenon of rural labor blindly flowing into cities has also stopped, the chaotic situation of numerous tasks in rural areas has begun to change, and the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses has greatly increased.

    华北各地大田播种进入紧张阶段
    华北各地大田播种已进入紧张阶段，干旱地区现正进行抗旱抢种。河北省张家口专区和通县专区的三个县已种谷子、高粱、玉米、豆类等三十万一千多亩，邢台专区内邱县谷子已种完百分之五十以上，邯郸专区等地已开始播种棉花。山西省四月上旬落雨后，各地立即趁墒播种，到现在仅永济县就完成了应播种面积的百分之七十。蒙绥地区春麦播种完成后，目前正播种玉米、莞扁豆、胡麻、莜麦等；昭乌达盟已播种五万多亩。北京、天津两市郊区大田播种已有百分之六十左右。但是，各地旱象的发展极为严重。河北省因旱不能播种的土地已达一千五百多万亩，该省党、政领导机关已在四月二十二日号召紧急开展抗旱播种运动，并组织一千二百个县、区干部深入农村，检查推动这一运动。该省有条件发展水利的地区，正积极打井开渠，扩大浇地，张家口专区已浇地五十三万四千多亩，耙耱保墒四百七十多万亩；通县专区平谷、昌平等县正动工兴修八条小渠，可扩大水田一万多亩。内蒙古自治区通辽县三月中即开渠引西辽河水浇地十六万多亩。绥远省干旱地一般也进行了保墒工作。
    华北各地对春耕生产的领导已大大加强。四月初，华北各级中共党委都组织干部认真学习了中共中央关于春耕生产的指示和中共中央华北局关于春耕生产的指示等文件，明确了政策思想。山西、河北、绥远三省的省、专区、县三级干部下乡的达三千多人，他们帮助县、区、村适当安排各项工作，确实做到春耕生产成为压倒一切的中心任务。现在，各地互助合作运动中的盲目冒进偏向基本上已得到纠正，农村劳动力盲目流入城市的现象也已停止，农村中任务繁多等混乱情况已开始有所转变，农民群众的生产情绪已大大高涨。（新华社）
