Another New Creation in Bricklaying

Cui Jingbo, a trainee in the Winter Training Class of the First Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building's Electrical Engineering Bureau, after studying the advanced Soviet experience and Su Changyou's method of bricklaying with mortar squeezed by hand, diligently researched and pooled the wisdom of the masses to successfully create the spirit level bricklaying method. Using the spirit level bricklaying method can improve work efficiency, ensure the quality of bricklaying projects, save a large amount of materials, and, more importantly, replace the very scarce skilled workers with a large number of apprentices and ordinary workers.

The spirit level bricklaying method uses three tools for bricklaying. These three tools are: the vertical corner bricklaying instrument (a tool used by fifth-grade skilled workers for laying wall corners and wall piers), the level line ruler (a tool used by apprentices for laying the outer and inner skins of walls), and the mortar collection hopper (a tool for collecting residual mortar that falls from the mortar joints). The vertical corner bricklaying instrument and the level line ruler can be welded using square iron bars with a cross-section of nine millimeters or iron plates three millimeters thick, and inlaid with several spirit levels (sealed glass tubes filled with non-freezing liquid, used to measure horizontality); the mortar collection hopper is welded from tinplate, and its manufacture and operation are very simple.

Before the successful trial of the spirit level bricklaying method, the laying of wall corners and pier work generally required workers with certain skills and experience (at least second-grade workers) to ensure the wall corners were vertical. In construction work in 1951, Cui Jingbo often considered how to use an advanced tool that would allow apprentices to complete general bricklaying projects. After long-term research and improvement, he finally created the vertical corner bricklaying instrument, which uses two rectangular iron frames to form a 90-degree angle (a leaky angle, with a steel wire in the center of the angle to replace the plumb bob), and inlays spirit levels on the iron frame, which are placed at the corner. In this way, when fifth- or sixth-grade workers are laying wall corners, they only need to straighten the iron frame so that the bubbles in the two spirit levels are fixed in the appropriate designated positions, and they can release their hands and lay bricks against the iron frame.

The vertical corner bricklaying instrument solved the technical difficulties for apprentices in laying wall corners; however, the problem of apprentices laying wall skins had not been completely solved, because laying wall skins also required experience and skill to lay them flat and straight. Cui Jingbo put in a lot of hard work in this area. After repeated research and modification, he created a level line ruler, which is welded from iron bars or iron plates, with marks on the iron bars indicating the placement positions of header bricks and stretcher bricks, and a spirit level inlaid on each of the four sides. In this way, after a sixth-grade worker uses the metal level line ruler, as long as he places the bricks tightly against the iron sheet, he can lay regular work on general clear brick walls, and the quality is very high.

Before using the spirit level bricklaying method, the laying of wall corners, pier work, and the outer skin of general clear brick walls all required second-grade skilled workers, but after using the vertical corner bricklaying instrument, fifth-grade skilled workers can perform detailed work such as laying wall corners and piers. After using the level line ruler, sixth-grade workers can lay regular work on general clear brick walls. In the past, when bricklayers used Su Changyou's bricklaying method to lay mixed mortar walls below the window of 2.5 bricks thick, they generally used a five-person team, with skilled workers accounting for at least two, accounting for 40% of the total number of bricklayers in the team. When laying mixed mortar walls below the window of two bricks thick, they often used a four-person team, and at least two of them had to be skilled workers, accounting for 50% of the bricklayer team. However, after using the level bricklaying method and using the level line ruler, no matter how many bricks thick the wall is, or whether it is laying mixed mortar wall bricklaying work below or above the window, bricklaying teams composed purely of apprentices can be used for work. For every 20 or so apprentices, only one skilled worker is responsible for the duties of the group leader or squad leader, performing corner holding and quality inspection work. Therefore, skilled workers in this labor organization only account for about 5% of the total number of bricklayers. Not only can many skilled workers take on grassroots technical guidance work; but also a large door has been opened in terms of the source of bricklayers, and the vast number of farmers and young women can participate in this work.

Based on the construction strength of the Electrical Engineering Bureau's First Engineering Company, if the spirit level bricklaying method is implemented, the construction strength will undergo significant changes:

1. Before the creation of the vertical corner bricklaying instrument and the level line ruler, all the bricklayers in the company, in the construction of double-sided plastered walls (taking two bricks thick as an example), could only be formed into 51 bricklaying teams according to the labor volume stipulated by the Northeast Finance and Economic Commission in 1953 (the outer skin is laid by third-grade workers, and the inner skin is laid by fourth-grade workers). However, if advanced tools are used to assist construction according to the spirit level bricklaying method, more than 150 teams can be formed (because when laying the inner and outer wall skins of double-sided plastered walls according to this advanced bricklaying method, the highest level required is only seventh-grade apprentices). Therefore, in the construction of double-sided plastered walls, the strength of skilled workers is equivalent to an increase of two times.

2. Before the creation of the vertical corner bricklaying instrument and the level line ruler, all the bricklayers in the company, in the construction of single-sided clear water walls (also taking two bricks thick as an example), could only be formed into five bricklaying teams according to the labor volume stipulated by the Northeast Finance and Economic Commission's 1953 quota manual (the outer skin should be laid by second-grade workers, and the inner skin should be laid by fourth-grade workers). However, if advanced tools are used to assist construction according to the spirit level bricklaying method, 154 construction teams can be formed (because when laying the outer skin of single-sided clear water walls according to this advanced bricklaying method, only sixth-grade skilled workers are required, and seventh-grade apprentices can do the inner skin). Therefore, in the construction of single-sided clear water walls, the strength of skilled workers is equivalent to an increase of 30 times.

3. For the same reasons as mentioned above, in the construction of double-sided clear water walls, if the spirit level bricklaying method is not adopted, hundreds of bricklayers can only be formed into five construction teams (because according to the quota manual, the outer and inner skins should be laid by second- and third-grade workers respectively). However, if the spirit level bricklaying method is used, the same hundreds of bricklayers can be formed into 120 construction teams. Therefore, the construction strength is increased by 23 times compared to the past.

The above three examples fully illustrate the superiority of this advanced work method, which is first reflected in the increase in construction strength. This is a major contribution to solving the contradiction between large basic construction tasks and small construction strength.

Secondly, the adoption of this method also improves work efficiency and ensures quality. The standard efficiency is an average of 6,000 bricks per person per day. During normal operation, laying in a five-stretcher and one-header bond, each apprentice can lay an average of 4,600 bricks per day. Laying in a three-stretcher and one-header bond, each apprentice can lay an average of 4,300 bricks per day. Laying in a one-stretcher and one-header bond, each apprentice can lay an average of 3,500 bricks per day. In the construction in 1952, apprentices could generally only lay more than 800 bricks, so the efficiency can be increased by three to five times. The quality can not only reach the quality standards of the former Northeast Industry Department, but also reach more than 95% in compressive area.

The adoption of this method also greatly saves materials and reduces engineering costs. The savings in cement and wood alone are a large figure. Because the use of mortar collection hoppers can save a lot of mortar. In the past, these mortars were invisibly wasted, and at least 0.015 cubic meters of mortar was lost per cubic meter of brick masonry. If the vertical corner bricklaying instrument is used, not only can a large amount of mortar be saved; but also the quota for the consumption of wood for line poles can be reduced a lot. Taking the task of the Electrical Engineering Bureau's First Engineering Company in 1953 as an example, it can save about 700 million yuan.

At the same time, the adoption of this method also creates favorable conditions for the use of inner scaffolding. The introduction of advanced Soviet experience attaches great importance to the issue of inner scaffolding. Because after the implementation of inner scaffolding, not only can a large number of scaffolding poles be saved; but also the safety of workers can be further guaranteed. After using the level line ruler to lay bricks, the quality of the inner and outer walls is almost the same, so bricklayers on the inner scaffolding can also take care of the bricklaying of the outer walls. Using the level line ruler to lay walls, the inner wall surface is relatively flat, which can also reduce the first step (priming) of the plastering project. Therefore, it not only saves man-hours, but also saves plastering materials.

Recently, the Winter Training Class held a grand performance meeting on the spirit level bricklaying method. At the end of the meeting, Deputy Director Xiao of the Central Electrical Engineering Bureau instructed: "This advanced bricklaying method has basically been successful. It not only has higher work efficiency, but the more significant contribution is that it can replace the very scarce skilled workers with a large number of apprentices and ordinary workers. This is a favorable factor in solving the contradiction between the large basic construction tasks and small construction strength this year. Therefore, it should not only be promoted first in the national electrical engineering system, but it is also recommended to be vigorously promoted in a larger scope." (With pictures)

### 砌砖法上又一新的创造

    砌砖法上又一新的创造
    第一机械工业部电工局第一工程公司冬训班学员崔静波同志，在学习苏联先进经验及苏长有双手挤浆砌砖法的基础上，苦心钻研，并集中群众智慧，创造水平器砌砖法成功。运用水平器砌砖法可以提高工作效率，保证砌砖工程质量，大量节省材料，更重要的是能以大量的徒工与普通工来代替很缺乏的技工。
    水平器砌砖法利用三种工具进行砌砖。这三种工具是：垂直砌角器（五级技工砌墙角及墙垛子用的工具）、平线尺（徒工砌墙外皮及里皮用的工具）及接灰斗（收容灰缝中脱落残灰的工具）。垂直砌角器与平线尺可以用断面九公厘的正方形铁筋或三公厘厚的铁板加以焊接，并镶上数个水平珠（封闭式的玻璃管，内装不冻浆液，用以测量水平）而成；接灰斗是用洋铁板焊接而成，制造与操作很简单。
    在水平器砌砖法试验成功以前，一般砌墙角和垛子活时，需要有一定技术和经验的工人（起码二级工人），才能做到墙角垂直。崔静波同志在一九五一年施工中，常常考虑到如何使用一种先进的工具，使徒工也可以完成一般的砌砖工程。经过长期的研究与改进，终于创造了垂直砌角器，即用两个长方形的铁架，拼成九十度的角（漏缝的角，角中央有一根钢丝代替线锤），并在铁架上镶上水平珠，放在转角处。这样，五、六级工人在砌墙角时，只要将铁架摆直，使两个水平珠内的水泡固定在适当的指定部位时，就可以靠着铁架放手砌砖了。
    垂直砌角器解决了徒工砌墙角的技术困难；但是，徒工砌墙皮的问题还没有得到完全解决，因为砌墙皮也要有经验有技术，才能砌的又平又直。崔静波同志在这方面又下了苦功。经过反复研究与修改，他又创造了一种平线尺，这种平线尺是用铁筋或铁板焊制而成，在铁筋上有表示丁砖与顺砖放置位置的标记，并在四个边上分别镶入一个水平珠。这样，一个六级工使用了金属平线尺以后，只要紧靠着铁皮摆砖，就能砌一般清水砖墙的规矩活，而且质量还很高。
    使用水平器砌砖法以前，砌墙角、垛子活和砌一般清水墙外皮，都须二级技工才能干，但使用垂直砌角器后，五级技工就能干砌墙角及垛子等细致活。使用平线尺后，六级工就能砌一般清水墙的规矩活。过去瓦工按苏长有砌砖法，砌二点五砖的窗口以下混水墙时，一般的采用五人小组，其中技工至少占两名，技工数占全瓦工小组人数的百分之四十。又在砌二砖的窗口以下的混水墙时，往往采用四人小组，而其中的技工至少也须两名，这样的瓦工小组技工占百分之五十。但按水平器砌砖法使用平线尺后，不论砌几砖厚的墙，也不论砌窗口以下或窗口以上的混水墙的瓦工活，均可采用纯由徒工组成的砌砖小组进行工作。每二十名左右的徒工，只由一名熟练技工担任大组长或小队长的职务，从中进行抱角与质量检查工作。因此，技工在这种劳动组织中只占全瓦工人数的百分之五左右。不但使不少的技工可以担任基层的技术指导工作；并在瓦工来源上也开了一个很大的门，广大的农民与青年妇女均可参加这一工作。
    如以电工局第一工程公司的施工力量为根据，假如施行水平器砌砖法后，施工力量有显著变化：
    1、在垂直砌角器及平线尺创造之前，该公司所有瓦工在砌双面抹灰墙（以两砖厚为例）的工程施工中，按一九五三年东北财委会定额规定的劳动量
    （外皮由三级工砌，里皮由四级工砌），只能编成五十一个砌砖小组。但要按水平器砌砖法利用先进工具帮助施工的话，则可编成一百五十余个小组（因按这个先进砌砖法砌双面抹灰墙的内外墙皮时，最高只须七级徒工就可掌握）。因此，在砌造双面抹灰墙的工程施工中，其技工力量等于增长了二倍。
    2、在垂直砌角器及平线尺创造以前，该公司所有瓦工在砌单面清水墙（亦以两砖厚为例）的工程施工中，按一九五三年东北财委会定额手册规定的劳动量（外皮应由二级工砌，里皮由四级工砌），只能编成五个砌砖小组。但要按水平器砌砖法利用先进工具帮助施工的话，则可编成一百五十四个施工小组（因按这个先进砌砖法砌单面清水墙的外皮只须六级技工，里皮七级徒工就可以做）。因此，在砌造单面清水墙的工程施工中，其技工力量则等于增长了三十倍。
    3、按前述同样的理由，在砌造双面清水墙中，如不采用水平器砌砖法，数百名瓦工亦只能编为五个施工小组（因按定额手册规定外皮、里皮应分别由二、三级工来砌）。但按水平器砌砖法来砌，同样的数百名瓦工则能编成一百二十个施工小组。因此，其施工力量比过去增长了二十三倍。
    上述三个事例，充分说明这一先进工作法的优越性，首先表现在施工力量的增长上，这样，对解决基本建设任务大、施工力量小的矛盾，是一个重大贡献。
    其次，采用这一方法后，还提高了工作效率，保证了质量。标定效率平均每人每天为六千块砖。正常操作时，按五顺一丁叠砌，平均每徒工每日可砌四千六百块砖。按三顺一丁叠砌，平均每徒工每日可砌四千三百块砖。按一顺一丁叠砌，平均每徒工每日可砌三千五百块砖。而在一九五二年施工中徒工一般的仅能砌八百余块砖，因此，效率可以提高三倍到五倍。质量不但能达到过去东北工业部的质量标准，并在抗压面积上，达到百分之九十五以上。
    采用这一方法，还大大节省了材料，降低了工程成本。仅水泥木材方面的节约，就是一个很大的数字。因为使用接灰斗，可以节约大量灰浆。过去，这些灰浆是无形地被浪费掉，每立方公尺的砖砌体至少有○·○一五立方公尺的灰浆被损失了。假如使用垂直砌角器后，不但可以节省大量灰浆；而且线杆的木材消耗定额也降低很多。如以电工局第一工程公司一九五三年任务来说，约可节约人民币七亿元。
    同时，采用这一办法，也为使用里脚手创造了有利条件。苏联先进经验介绍中，对里脚手问题非常重视。因为里脚手施行后，不但可节省大量的脚手杆；并可以进一步保障工人安全。采用平线尺砌砖后，其里外墙面的质量近乎一样，所以在里脚手架上的瓦工也可以照顾外墙面砌砖。使用平线尺砌墙，其里墙面较为平整，也可减少抹灰工程的第一道工序（打底）。因此，不但节省工时，同时也节省抹灰材料。
    最近，该冬训班曾召开了盛大的水平器砌砖法表演大会。会末，中央电工局萧副局长曾指示说：“这个先进的砌砖法基本上是成功了，不但有较高的工作效率，而更重大的贡献是能以大量的徒工及普通工来代替很缺乏的技工。这对解决今年基本建设任务大，施工力量小的矛盾，是一个有利的因素。因此不但应首先在全国电工系统内进行推广，并建议在更大的范围内大力的推广。”（附图片）
