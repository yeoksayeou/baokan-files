In Dingxiang, Yangqu, Xin County, and Guoxian County, the supply and marketing cooperatives have displayed a very serious commandist work style in supplying the means of production. This manifests in: 1. Lack of publicity and education, forcing apportionment. Ding Hanbao, a cadre of the Guoxian County Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, forced the village chief of Nanjie Village to sign an agreement to promote the walking plow. Because the village chief did not consult with the farmers and was unwilling to sign the agreement, Ding Hanbao criticized him, saying, "Not borrowing a walking plow means not being active on the production front," and detained the village chief for three days. When the masses of Nanjie Village learned of this, they were very dissatisfied and said: "Don't let the village chief suffer because we didn't borrow the walking plow." As a result, they sent someone to borrow twenty-seven plows, but most of these plows were not used. 2. Blindly promoting without considering the region or production conditions. Yangqu Eighth District is originally a mountainous area. Last year, during drought prevention and resistance, farmers dug sixty-six wells that could only be used to carry water to irrigate crops, but the district cadres insisted on installing waterwheels and implementing "waterwheelization." Some village cadres were unwilling to install waterwheels, and the district cadres said they were "ideologically resistant and not serving the people." The village cadres had no choice but to coerce the masses in the same way. Some village cadres threatened the masses who were unwilling to buy waterwheels, saying: "Not installing a waterwheel means not responding to the call of the People's Government, it means not resisting America and aiding Korea." As a result, forty-five waterwheels were installed, but these waterwheels were completely unusable. Some district and village cadres even installed waterwheels for the masses without even knowing how to do it. Beixiaodiangou in the Fifth District is a heavily alkaline wetland, and even water from the river cannot be used for irrigation, but the district cadres still forced the masses to buy nineteen waterwheels, resulting in fourteen of them being unusable. 3. Averaging distribution without considering the target or the actual needs of the masses. Zhongcaozhang Village in Xin County distributed means of production worth 1.97 million yuan to five impoverished military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families with no labor power; and distributed more than 1.9 million yuan of means of production to ten families of orphans, widows, elderly, and the weak, including two who had been sick for many years were allocated 860,000 yuan of means of production, and three old widows whose families were very difficult and relied on their daughters' families for support all year round, were also allocated more than 150,000 yuan of means of production. 4. Blindly carrying out sales competitions for means of production, using challenges as a means of forced apportionment. Last autumn, at the county, district, and village three-level expanded cadre meeting in Dingxiang County, the county proposed a task of selling 290 waterwheels, 1,500 walking plows, and 2.36 million catties of fine fertilizer throughout the county, and asked district and village cadres to challenge themselves and report. As a result, 200 waterwheels and 220 walking plows were not sold and 600 million yuan of funds were tied up. The walking plows that had already been sold were also "locked up." Qianyangpo Village in Yangqu County only had 120 mu of flat land, and originally only one or two walking plows would have been enough, but as a result, ten were apportioned to the masses. 5. Forcing village cadres and organized farmers to take the lead in buying, resulting in excessive investment and making their lives difficult. The village chief of Fanglan Village in Dingxiang bought 700,000 yuan of means of production last year. The family of six only harvested six big stones of grain. Because he could not repay the payment for the means of production, he borrowed another 200,000 yuan from the credit cooperative, and the family's life was also affected.

The result of this forced apportionment and blindly selling means of production without considering the actual situation is that many villages have to store the means of production because they cannot be sold. When the higher authorities ask for payment, the village cadres arbitrarily apportion it based on land area, households, livestock, households with vehicles, and labor power. In Xin County's Ershilipu, the apportionment was based on households with livestock, with each household with a donkey paying 30,000 yuan, each household with a cow paying 42,000 yuan, and households without livestock were apportioned according to the strength of their labor force. After the means of production were distributed to the masses, they were forced to pay. Wang Youhuai, a farmer in Hengshan Village, Dingxiang, was forced to sell eight mu of land because he could not repay the payment for the means of production. Zhang Jihe, a farmer in Fuxing Village, was forced to sell five rooms. Therefore, many farmers are very dissatisfied and regard the supply and marketing cooperatives as "creditors," and some villagers dare not see the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives.

The reasons for the above deviations are mainly the bureaucracy of the leading organs above the county level, not understanding the actual investment capacity of the masses, and unrealistically advocating so-called "walking plowization" and "waterwheelization," assigning too much work, and not inspecting. Last autumn, the leaders of Yangqu County subjectively calculated according to the "walking plowization" of all flat land, and wanted to supply 3,666 walking plows throughout the county, distributing them to the villages level by level according to the acreage of flat land in each village. Guoxian County did not prepare early for the supply of walking plows, and only promoted them after the farmers began autumn plowing. Therefore, the county committee decided to launch a walking plow sales campaign within three days, the district decided to form a campaign within two days, and when it reached the village, it had to be completed in one day. As a result, the village cadres had to distribute them by household. In addition, the championship-seeking mentality of some cadres is also one of the reasons for forming commandism. They believe that the more means of production they sell, the greater their achievements in leading production, regardless of whether the masses really need them or what methods they use to sell them. Wang Erdan, director of the Yangxing Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yangqu, followed the "waterwheelization" slogan put forward by the county and also came up with "waterwheelization." As a result, he sold forty-five waterwheels in one ditch, none of which were used. The masses reflected: "In order to become a model, Erdan made a river of waterwheels, and more than 2 million yuan of 'black donkeys' were wasted!"

The Xin County Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is now studying the above situation and has decided to take measures to solve it. (Xin County Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)

    定襄等县强迫摊派生产资料影响群众生产
    定襄、阳曲、忻县、崞县等县供销合作社，在供应生产资料工作中，强迫命令作风十分严重。表现在：一、不宣传不教育，强迫摊派。中共崞县二区区委会干部丁汉保，强迫与南街村长订推广步犁的协议，因该村长未与农民商谈，不愿订立协议，丁汉保便指责说：“不贷步犁就是在生产战线上不积极”，将村长留难三天。南街村群众知道此事，很不满意地说：不要因咱不贷步犁让村长受难。结果派人贷回二十七张犁，但这些犁大部未用。二 、不看地区不顾生产条件，盲目推广。阳曲八区本来是山地，在去年防旱抗旱时，农民打了六十六眼仅能担水点浇庄稼的水井，但区干部却硬让安水车，实行“水车化”，有的村干部不愿安水车，区干部就说“思想抵触，不为人民服务”。村干部没办法，只好用同样的办法威逼群众。有些村干部对不愿买水车的群众威吓说：不安水车就是不响应人民政府的号召，就是不抗美援朝。结果安水车四十五部，而这些水车完全不能使用。甚至有的区村干部给群众把水车安上了，本人还不知道。五区北小店沟是重碱性湿地，河里有水还不能浇，区干部也强迫群众买水车十九部，结果有十四部用不上。三、不看对象，不顾群众实际需要，平均分配。忻县中曹张村，给五户无劳动力的贫苦军属、烈属，分配了价值一百九十七万元的生产资料；另给十户孤、寡、老弱的农民也分配了一百九十多万元的生产资料，其中有两户长年害病者就分配了八十六万元的生产资料，三个老寡妇家境很困难，常年靠闺女家养活，也给分配了十五万多元的生产资料。四、盲目地开展推销生产资料竞赛，以挑战为强迫摊派的手段。去年秋季，定襄县在县、区、村三级扩大干部会议上，县里提出在全县推销水车二百九十部、步犁一千五百张、细肥二百三十六万斤的任务，让区、村干部挑战自报。结果有二百部水车、二百二十张步犁没有推销出去，积压资金六亿元。已经推销出去的步犁也坐了“禁闭”。阳曲前阳坡村只有一百二十亩平地，本来只有一、二张步犁就够用了，结果给群众摊派了十张。五、强迫村干部和组织起来的农民带头买，形成投资过大，使他们的生活发生困难。定襄芳兰村村长，去年带头购买了七十万元的生产资料，全家六口人，只打下六大石粮食，因还不起生产资料款，又从信用社贷款二十万元，全家生活也受到影响。
    这种强迫群众和不根据实际情况盲目推销生产资料的结果，使得很多村庄因为分配来的生产资料卖不了，只好存放起来，上面要款，村干部就按地亩、按户、按牲畜、按有车户、按劳动力等乱摊派。忻县二十里铺按有牲畜户摊派，每个有驴户出三万元，有牛户出四万二千元，无牲畜户即按劳动力强弱摊派。把生产资料分配到群众手里，就强迫要款，定襄横山村农民王有槐，因还不起生产资料款，被迫卖地八亩。复兴村农民张吉和被迫卖房五间。因此，很多农民十分不满，把供销社看成“债主”，有的村群众就不敢见供销社的干部。
    造成以上偏向的原因，主要是县以上领导机关的官僚主义，不了解群众的实际投资能力，不切实际地提倡所谓“步犁化”、“水车化”，工作多布置，不检查。去年秋季，阳曲县领导上主观地按全部平地“步犁化”推算，要在全县供应步犁三千六百六十六张，按各村平地亩数逐级分配到村。崞县对供应步犁不早作准备，到农民秋耕地开始后才推销，于是，县委会决定在三天以内要形成推销步犁运动，区里又决定两天形成运动，到了村里，一天就得完成，结果，村干部只得按户分配。另外，某些干部的锦标主义思想，也是形成强迫命令的原因之一。他们认为推销的生产资料越多，自己领导生产的成绩就越大，却不管群众是否真正需要，和用什么办法推销的。阳曲阳兴镇供销社主任王二旦，按县里提出的“水车化”的口号，也来了个“水车化”，结果在一个沟推销了四十五部水车，一部也没用。群众反映说：“二旦为了当模范，水车闹下一河滩，二百多万元的‘黑驴子’白花了钱！”
    现中共忻县地委会在研究了以上情况后，决定采取措施加以解决。（中共忻县地方委员会）
