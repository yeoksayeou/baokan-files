Editor's Note: Fulongshan Village is a small village in the Sixth District of Jinxi County, Liaoxi Province. The village's political power was usurped by the counter-revolutionary element Bao Haishan shortly after liberation in 1946. Bao Haishan was originally a bandit leader who, after the local liberation, pretended to be active and seized the opportunity to become the village chief. Then he colluded with the village public security committee member Liu Xianghe, threatening and enticing most of the village cadres to join him in doing evil and committing all kinds of crimes. The local people hated Bao Haishan to the bone. From 1950, more than 50 people repeatedly went to the district and county to file complaints. However, the former deputy secretary of the district committee, Huang Jinyi, and the former district public security assistant Cao Pinqing, seriously lost their position, not only sheltering and condoning Bao Haishan's illegal and undisciplined behavior, but even further helping Bao Haishan frame active elements among the masses. Zhang Yan, Director of the Public Security Bureau of Jinxi County People's Government, and the leading cadres of the Jinxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had a serious bureaucratic work style. Without in-depth investigation, they blindly believed the false reports of bad elements, detained five farmers including Li Jiechen who accused Bao Haishan, and sentenced them to imprisonment on charges of "conspiracy to riot," resulting in Li Jiechen's death in prison. As many as 16 people in Fulongshan Village were directly victimized for accusing Bao Haishan. This serious incident has been investigated and clarified by the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government and the Jinxi County People's Government Supervision Committee. The Liaoxi Provincial Party and government leading organs have severely punished the illegal and derelict officials in the case: Bao Haishan was sentenced to death and publicly executed; Liu Xianghe was expelled from the Party and sentenced to life imprisonment; Cao Pinqing was expelled from the Party and sentenced to two years of labor reform for embezzlement and perversion of justice during the "Three-Anti" movement, and now the sentence has been increased to ten years of imprisonment; Huang Jinyi was expelled from the Party and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment; Zhang Yan (who was found to have errors such as colluding with unscrupulous merchants during the "Three-Anti" movement) was expelled from the Party and sentenced to two years of imprisonment; other derelict personnel were also punished or made self-criticisms. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to dissolve the Fulongshan Village branch and ordered the Jinxi County Committee to re-examine and register the members of the Fulongshan Village branch. The following article describes the new face of Fulongshan Village after this incident was seriously dealt with.

    In late March, I visited Fulongshan Village, Sixth District of Jinxi County. This vibrant little mountain village, which has grown and strengthened through struggle, left me with a very deep impression. After the Communist Party and the People's Government seriously and correctly dealt with the counter-revolutionary element Bao Haishan and others who usurped village power and cruelly persecuted the masses, the face of Fulongshan Village was completely renewed.

    Six years ago, the people of Fulongshan Village joyfully celebrated the liberation of Jinxi. But they did not expect that the clear blue sky would be covered by a dark cloud again – the counter-revolutionary element Bao Haishan, who came from a bandit background, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and became the village chief. For six years, he and the bad element Liu Xianghe, a member of the Public Security Committee, and others, controlled the village political power, like a thousand-pound stone pressing on the people's heads. They acted tyrannically, oppressed the masses, extorted and blackmailed, embezzled grain and money, sheltered landlords, raped women, and framed good people, becoming "local emperors" and "local tyrants." The people of Fulongshan Village, in such dark and unfree, undemocratic, and unhappy days, had united to carry out an indomitable struggle. They reported and accused, from the district to the county, repeatedly, and finally appealed to the province and the Great Administrative Region. Although in the middle, due to the loss of position by the original district cadres Huang Jinyi and Cao Pinqing who sheltered and supported the counter-revolutionary elements and conspired to frame the masses, and the serious bureaucratic elements, the original county public security bureau chief Zhang Yan, mistakenly arrested, detained, and even sentenced the accusers, so that Li Jiechen, an active member of the masses who adhered to the truth, upheld justice, and dared to fight resolutely against bad people and bad deeds, died unjustly in prison, Liu Xianting was forced to death, Liu Enhong and Liu Guangren, who actively participated in the accusation, wandered outside, and many masses suffered for a long time; however, with the care and support of the superior Party and the People's Government, the people of Fulongshan Village finally won. The counter-revolutionary element Bao Haishan fell before the people.

    On March 18 this year, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government held a large meeting in Shaguotun to publicly try the counter-revolutionary element Bao Haishan. What a day worthy of celebration for Fulongshan Village! Two or three hundred men, women, and children flocked to Shaguotun, ten miles away, to see Bao Haishan's end. Some families went all out, bringing their sons and daughters. Some people didn't sleep all night, and got up as soon as the east turned white. Zhao Rongji got up before the rooster crowed and rode a donkey to Pianlianzi Village, 25 miles away, to bring his wife, who was staying at her mother's house, back to participate in the meeting together. Usually children are afraid of dead people, but after Bao Haishan was executed, I don't know which seven or eight-year-old child ran up and picked up a stone and hit the corpse, and said bitterly: "You old undead bad thing, this time you are dead!" The villagers of Fulongshan Village swept away the worries of the past and generally said: "They all said that Fulongshan has no sky, but this time there is a sky!" "The Communist Party has moved away the big stone pressing on us!" The young farmer Li Changliang returned to the village and saw the fellow villagers waiting for news, and kept raising his thumb and saying: "It is really the people's government!" Li Jiechen's old mother, the family member of the victim, shed tears of mixed sadness and joy when she heard that Bao Haishan had been shot. She walked to the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging at home and said: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! If it weren't for your old man's government to settle this lawsuit, my son's injustice would have nowhere to appeal, and the hatred would have nowhere to be avenged!" Li Jiechen's wife specially made two big red flowers and respectfully inserted them on the side of Chairman Mao's portrait, and wiped the dust off the portrait. She said she would go to the market to buy a frame to mount it...

    In the past, because of Bao Haishan's evil deeds and the bureaucracy of some cadres in Jinxi County, the flesh-and-blood connection between the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the people of Fulongshan Village was once damaged. Now this connection has been quickly restored. The farmers were so affectionate to the government staff who came to Fulongshan Village to investigate and deal with this case that many families took out the food they were reluctant to eat to invite the staff to eat. Li Jiechen's old mother baked a few sticky buns, grabbed the staff's hands and insisted on them eating them. She said: "There is nothing else, just to express my heart." In the countryside, especially in this remote mountain village, the etiquette of shaking hands is not common. However, this time all the staff shook many warm hands that were proactively extended. When the staff left, more than 100 villagers voluntarily came out to see them off for three or four miles, and even after the people had walked far away, they were still waving there.

    After the Fulongshan incident was handled with great fanfare, the villagers' courage to eliminate evil was unprecedentedly enhanced, and they continued to boldly expose bad people and bad deeds. After the public trial meeting, the villagers went to the government staff to talk, report the situation, and ask for solutions to problems. An old lady, Li, who was over seventy years old, blind in both eyes, and never went out, groped to the place where the staff lived with a cane, sat on the kang, and said: "You are people sent down by Chairman Mao, I have been looking forward to you at my doorstep, I have to talk to you carefully..." Farmer Liu Enyou's wife came back from the meeting in Shaguotun and prepared a donkey and asked someone to go to a village outside to pick up her sister from her parents' home to find the staff to accuse the past and present grievances. The news that the People's Government had seriously and correctly handled the Fulongshan incident spread quickly, to other districts, to other counties, and to other provinces. Guo Chenglin, a farmer from Xiaolishugou Village, Fourteenth District, Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, heard this news and immediately led his nephew and niece-in-law to rush from thirty or forty miles away to Fulongshan Village to find the staff from the Northeast Bureau to appeal for justice.

    Four months after Bao Haishan was arrested, the farmers of Fulongshan Village, under the leadership of the superior government, re-elected a new village political power. Most of the current village cadres and people's representatives are active members who have been tempered in the struggle against Bao Haishan. They have the quality and style of loyal service to the people. The masses expressed their gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party in their trust and support for the new political power. All 70,000 jin of public grain in the village were delivered on time, which had never happened before. The village people's representative meeting, which had never been held, was about to be convened. The content of the meeting was to promote the experience of Zhaoyuan County, discuss the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers, and make requests and opinions to the village government and new and old cadres. Li Changwen, a people's representative, holding the notice issued by the village people's representative meeting requesting the collection of proposals, said: "This is really different from the past. When Bao Haishan was in power, being a people's representative was just a signboard, and it was useless to make suggestions. As a district representative, I had never been to the district, and there had never been a representative meeting in the village. Now I can speak for the people."

    The people of Fulongshan Village, who have truly become masters, are using endless power to build a new life. The current Fulongshan Village is changing everywhere, and everything is new. In the past, due to the cruel oppression of the tyrant Bao Haishan and others, the masses were depressed and had no intention of production. Now, they work early and late, and some are busy with sideline production until late at night. Fulongshan Village has not added livestock for three or four years, and the whole village of 200 households has only one broken cart. Less than a month after the counter-revolutionary element Bao Haishan was arrested, four new carts, four donkeys, three cows, and more than fifty sheep were bought. Guo Cheng bought ten sheep the day after Bao Haishan was arrested. He said that he had long wanted to buy them, but he didn't dare to. There were no mutual aid teams in the village before, but now ten have been organized. Among them, the groups of Li Guangchang and Guo Xianzhou have formulated detailed production plans. People not only see the present, but also consider future development. In groups of three or five, they talk about planting fruit trees on the surrounding bald mountains and developing animal husbandry in the future.... The people who have been politically liberated eagerly demand cultural liberation. A people's school has been established, and there are often more than 40 people studying there. A crash literacy class has started, and more than 40 people go to class. Li Changliang, a young farmer who participated in the crash literacy class, was still spelling out the alphabet while delivering manure, and the woman Li Yuqin practiced writing on the ground while cooking. This is the first time in Fulongshan Village since liberation.

    死气沉沉的村庄变得朝气勃勃
    ——记富隆山村清除篡夺村政权的反革命分子后的新气象
    韩文涛
    编者按：富隆山村是辽西省锦西县六区的一个小村。这个村的村政权在一九四六年解放后不久，就被反革命分子包海山篡夺了。包海山原是土匪头子，在当地刚解放时，伪装积极，乘机当了村长。接着他就勾结村公安委员刘香合，威胁利诱大部村干部与之同流合污，为非作歹，无恶不作。当地群众对包海山恨之入骨，从一九五○年开始曾有五十多人多次到区、县去控告。但前区委副书记黄金镒、前区公安助理曹品卿严重丧失立场，不仅包庇纵容包海山等的违法乱纪行为，甚至更进一步地帮助包海山陷害群众中的积极分子。锦西县人民政府公安局局长张晏和中共锦西县委会的领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风，不深入调查即盲目地听信坏分子的假报告，把控告包海山的农民李杰臣等五人扣押，加以“阴谋暴动”的罪名，分别判处徒刑，以致李杰臣病死狱中。富隆山村群众因控告包海山直接受害者达十六人之多。这一严重事件业经辽西省人民政府和锦西县人民政府人民监察委员会查清，辽西省党政领导机关已严厉惩处了案中的违法失职分子：包海山被判处死刑，公审枪决；刘香合被开除党籍，判处无期徒刑；曹品卿因贪赃枉法，在“三反”运动中已被开除党籍，判处劳役改造二年，现加重判处有期徒刑十年；黄金镒被开除党籍，判处十年徒刑；张晏（在“三反”运动中即曾被发现有拉拢奸商等错误）被开除党籍，判处徒刑二年；其他失职人员也都受到了处分或作了检讨。中共中央东北局纪律检查委员会决定解散富隆山村的支部，并责令锦西县委重新审查登记富隆山村支部的党员。下面这篇通讯记述了富隆山村在这一事件严肃处理后的新的面貌。
    三月下旬，我访问了锦西县六区富隆山村。这个朝气蓬勃，从斗争中成长壮大起来的小小山庄，留给我一个非常深刻的印象。共产党和人民政府严肃、正确地处理了篡夺村政权的反革命分子包海山等残酷迫害群众的事件以后，富隆山村的面貌焕然一新。
    六年前，富隆山村群众欢天喜地地庆祝了锦西解放。但没有想到，刚刚晴了的蓝天又罩上了一块乌云——土匪头子出身的反革命分子包海山又混进革命队伍当了村长。六年来，他和坏分子公安委员刘香合等把持村政权，像一块千斤的大石压在人民头上。他们横行霸道，欺压群众，敲诈勒索，贪污粮款，包庇地主，强奸妇女，陷害好人，成了“土皇帝”、“土霸王”。富隆山村的人民在这样黑暗无光、享受不到自由、民主、幸福的痛苦日子里，曾经团结起来进行不屈不挠的斗争。检举控告，由区到县，一告再告，最后上告到省到大行政区。虽然中间由于丧失立场的原区干部黄金镒、曹品卿包庇支持反革命分子，合谋陷害群众，严重官僚主义分子原县公安局长张晏的错误地把检举人逮捕、扣押，以至判刑，使坚持真理、主持正义、敢于向坏人坏事作坚决斗争的群众积极分子李杰臣冤死狱中，刘宪亭被逼而死，积极参加控告的刘恩鸿、刘广仁流浪在外，很多群众长期受害；但是在上级党和人民政府的关怀支持下，富隆山村的人民终于最后胜利了。反革命分子包海山在人民面前倒下了。
    今年三月十八日，辽西省人民政府在沙锅屯开大会，公审反革命分子包海山。这一天，对于富隆山村来说该是多么值得欢呼的一天哪！男女老幼二、三百人涌向十里外的沙锅屯，去看包海山的下场。有的全家一个人不留，携男抱女地全去了。有的人一宿没睡觉，东方一发白就起身。赵荣久在鸡没叫时就起来骑驴到二十五里远的偏脸子村把正住娘家的妻子接回来，一同去参加大会。通常小孩子是害怕死人的，可是当包海山伏法以后，不知是那一个七、八岁的小孩竟跑到跟前拾起一块石头朝着死尸打去，并恨恨地说：“你这个老不死的坏东西，这回可死了！”富隆山村老乡一扫往日的愁容，普遍说：“都说富隆山没天，这回有天了！”“共产党把压着咱们的这块大石头算给搬掉了！”青年农民李长良回到村看见等候消息的众乡亲，不住地伸大姆指说：“真是人民的政府！”被害者家属李杰臣的老母亲听说把包海山枪毙了，悲喜交集地流下了泪。她走到家中挂的毛主席像前说：“毛主席呀！毛主席呀！要不是你老人家的政府给断了这场官司，我屈死儿子的冤算没处申，仇算没处报啦！”李杰臣的妻子特意扎了两朵大红花，恭恭敬敬地插在毛主席像片上边，并把像片上的灰尘擦了擦，掸了掸。她说还要上集去买块镜框装上……。
    过去因为包海山的作恶和锦西县某些干部的官僚主义，曾经一度破坏了共产党、人民政府和富隆山村人民的血肉联系。现在这种联系很快就恢复了。农民对到富隆山村调查处理这案的政府工作人员是那样的亲热，很多家把自己舍不得吃的食物拿出来请工作人员吃。李杰臣的老母亲烤了几个黏饽饽，拉着工作人员的手非叫吃不可。她说：“没有别的，表表心。”在乡下，尤其在这偏僻的山村，握手的礼节是不习惯的。可是，这次所有的工作人员却握过了很多主动伸过来的热情的手。工作人员走的时候，村里一百多老乡自动出来欢送三、四里地，人已走出很远很远，他们还在那里招手。
    富隆山事件大张旗鼓地处理了以后，村里群众的除恶勇气空前提高，继续大胆揭发坏人坏事。公审大会后，老乡们纷纷去找政府工作人员谈话，反映情况，要求解决问题。一个七十多岁双目失明从不出门的李老太太拄着棍子摸到工作人员住的地方，坐在炕上说：“你们是毛主席派下来的人，我可把你们盼到家门口了，得当着你们好好说说……。”农民刘恩有的妻子从沙锅屯开会回来就备上驴求人到外村去接娘家妹妹，来找工作人员控告过去的和现在的冤屈事。人民政府严肃正确地处理了富隆山事件的消息飞快地传开了，传到外区，传到外县，传到外省。热河省朝阳县十四区小梨树沟村农民郭成林听到这个消息，马上领着侄子、侄媳妇从三、四十里以外赶来富隆山村要找东北局来的工作人员替他申冤。
    四个月前包海山被逮捕以后，富隆山村农民在上级政府领导下，重新选出了新的村政权。现在的村干部和人民代表多数都是在与包海山作斗争中锻炼出来的积极分子。他们有忠诚为人民服务的品质和作风。群众把对毛主席、共产党的感激心情表达在对新政权的信任、支持上。全村七万斤公粮都按期送到，这是过去所没有过的。从来没有开过的村人民代表会议要召开了。会议内容是推广肇源县的经验、讨论优属工作、给村政府和新旧干部提要求和意见。人民代表李长文拿着村人民代表会发出的要求搜集提案通知书说：“这和过去真不一样了。包海山掌权时，当人民代表就是牌位，提了意见也白搭。当区代表没上过区，在村上也没有开过一回代表会。现在我可以代表人民说话了。”
    富隆山村的人民真正做了主人，就以无穷无尽的力量来建设新生活。现在的富隆山村，无处不变，无处不新。过去由于恶霸包海山等的残酷压迫，群众情绪低落，无心生产。现在则起早贪黑干活，有的搞副业生产忙到深夜。富隆山村三、四年没添牲畜了，全村二百户仅有一辆破车。反革命分子包海山被捕后不到一个月，就买进四辆新车，四头驴，三头牛，五十多只羊。郭成在包海山被捕的第二天就买了十只羊。他说，早有心买，就是不敢买。村里以前根本没有互助组，如今已组织了十个。其中李广昌、郭仙州两个组都已订出周密的生产计划。人们不光只看到眼前，也考虑到了将来的发展。三三五五地谈论着日后在四周秃山上栽种果树，发展牧畜业……。政治上得到翻身的人民殷切地要求文化翻身。民校成立了，经常有四十多人在那里学习。速成识字班开课了，也有四十来人去上课。参加速成识字班的青年农民李长良一边送粪一边还拼音，妇女李玉琴边做饭边在地上练习写字。这在富隆山村来说，还是解放以后的第一次。
