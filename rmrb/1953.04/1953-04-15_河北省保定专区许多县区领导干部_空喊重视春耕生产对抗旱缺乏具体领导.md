Many county and district leaders in Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, only verbally shout that "spring ploughing production is the overriding central task," but in reality, they are not doing so. In Wangdu County, more than ninety cadres are still dedicated to party rectification work, and very few cadres are working on production. The production work in the first district of Zhuozhou County is relatively good, but only one of the three district committee cadres is actually leading production. County-level cadres have realized that they should make spring ploughing production the primary task at present, but they are still not very clear about how to achieve this. The county makes a general arrangement to mobilize the masses to harrow the land to preserve moisture, plant trees and afforest, and order production plans. The district cadres also make a general arrangement to the villages. They don't know whether these things can and need to be done in the villages. Take harrowing the land as an example, they did not go to the villages to check the soil moisture and blindly arranged it. Some villages' land has become so dry that it cannot be sown, but they still have to "complete the task of harrowing the land to preserve moisture," I don't know how much manpower has been wasted in vain. In the fifth district of Xincheng County, out of a total of 50,000 mu of land, 20,000 mu have already become dry and without moisture, but the district cadres are still shouting "to harrow the land to preserve moisture." The farmers in Taibaoying, the second district of Xushui County, said dissatisfiedly: "It's useless to harrow again, the government insists on asking us to harrow, but what can we do!" This is the most serious problem at present. If we do not quickly and specifically help farmers fight drought and sow seeds, but only blindly shout "pay attention to production" and "prevent drought and preserve moisture" without being realistic, it will cause huge losses.

In such a drought situation, the masses urgently need wells and waterwheels. However, the waterwheels loaned out by the counties in Baoding Prefecture are far from meeting the needs of the masses. The entire prefecture originally planned to loan out 4,680 waterwheels in the first quarter, but only more than 1,700 have been loaned out so far. The masses need wells and waterwheels, but there are still many people who are unwilling to dig wells and buy waterwheels. This is because: (1) They were affected by the forced commandism in well digging last year. Some places forcibly formed teams of young and middle-aged people to dig wells last year, but few were successful. (2) They were affected by the blind expansion of public property by agricultural producers' cooperatives. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives took over wells and waterwheels at low prices; some members with waterwheels and wells did not receive the compensation they deserved, so everyone was unwilling to dig wells and buy waterwheels.

(3) Some farmers really want to buy waterwheels and dig wells, but they lack funds and strength. It is useless for the leaders to ignore these problems and only shout "pay attention to production" and "prevent drought and fight drought."

Baoding Prefecture has also neglected to guide farmers to make full use of existing wells and waterwheels. Generally, wells and waterwheels are used to irrigate very little land, and some have not even been used. If the "dragon ditch" for flowing water is raised and water is organized reasonably, the average well can expand the irrigated area by another five mu. If all parts of the prefecture pay attention to this issue, it is estimated that the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 80,000 mu, which is equivalent to adding more than 5,000 waterwheels. Only caring about "completing" the number of loaned waterwheels and dug wells, but not paying attention to this issue, cannot be regarded as truly strengthening the leadership of spring ploughing production.

In addition, judging from the situation in various parts of Baoding Prefecture, to strengthen the leadership of spring ploughing production, it is also necessary to solve the problem of rural cadres being too busy and restless in their work. Because the division of labor among village cadres is not clear, the village branch secretary, the village head, and some active village cadres are almost always busy with work and have no time for production; some local cadres have too much work, and some cadres have misunderstandings about party rectification and simply lie down and do nothing. This situation has occurred in twenty-five villages out of a total of eighty-two villages in the first district of Xincheng County. Some village cadres in the second district of Xushui County not only stopped working but also openly gambled; they did not even attend meetings convened by district cadres. In this district, there is a lot of land that can be harrowed once to retain moisture and can be sown, but because there is no one to lead, very little harrowing has been done, which has caused a lot of losses.

    河北省保定专区许多县区领导干部
    空喊重视春耕生产对抗旱缺乏具体领导
    河北省保定专区许多县区领导干部只是口头上喊“春耕生产是压倒一切的中心任务”，但实际上并没有这样做。望都县现在还有九十多个干部专门做整党工作，做生产工作的干部很少。涿县第一区的生产工作是比较好的，但三个区委干部只有一个人实际领导生产。县级干部已经认识了应当把春耕生产作为当前首要的工作，可是他们对于怎样做到这一点还是不很明确的。县里笼统地布置要发动群众耙地保墒、植树造林、订生产计划，区干部也就笼统地往村里布置。这些事到村里是不是都能够作，都需要作，他们就不知道了。就拿耙地来说吧，他们没有到各村去查验一下墒情，就盲目地布置下去。有些村子的地已经干得不能播种了，还要“完成耙地保墒任务”，不知白白浪费了多少人力。新城县第五区共有五万亩土地，已有两万亩已干得没有墒了，区干部还是喊“要耙地保墒”。徐水县二区太保营的农民不满地说：“再耙也没法种了，政府硬叫我们耙，可有什么办法呢！”这是当前最严重的一个问题。如果不迅速具体地帮助农民抗旱播种，只是不切实际地盲目地喊叫“注意生产”“防旱保墒”，将会造成巨大的损失。
    在这样干旱的情形下，群众是迫切需要水井和水车的。可是保定专区各县贷出的水车却离群众的需要非常远。全专区原计划在第一季度贷出水车四千六百八十辆，到现在仅贷出一千七百多辆。群众需要水井、水车，可是还有许多人不愿意打井，不愿意买水车。这是因为：（一）受去年打井中的强迫命令作风的影响。有些地方去年把青壮年强制编队打井，结果很少有打成的。（二）受农业生产合作社盲目扩大公有财产的影响。有些农业生产合作社把水井水车低价归公；有些有水车水井的社员，没有得到应得的报酬，大家就不愿打井、买水车了。
    （三）有些农民确实想买水车、想打井，但缺少资金和力量。领导方面不注意解决这些问题，只是空喊“注意生产”、“防旱抗旱”，是没有用处的。
    保定专区各地对于领导农民充分利用现有水井、水车也是忽视的。一般的水井、水车浇地都很少，有的甚至还没有使用起来。如果加高流水的“龙沟”，组织合理使水，平均每眼井可以再扩大浇地面积五亩。全专区各地如果都注意这个问题，估计能扩大水浇地八万亩以上，等于增加了五千多个水车。只顾“完成”贷水车、打井的数目字，而不注意这个问题，也是不能算作真正加强了对于春耕生产的领导。
    此外，就保定专区各地的情况来看，要加强对春耕生产的领导，还必须解决乡村干部工作太忙乱和不安心工作的问题。因为村干部分工不明确，村支部书记、村长和一些积极的村干部差不多整天是忙着工作，没有时间进行生产；有些地方干部工作太多，有些干部对整党有误解，竟躺倒不干了。新城县第一区共八十二个村，就有二十五个村发生了这种情况。徐水县第二区有些村干部不但不做工作了，而且公开聚赌；区干部召集他们开会，他们也不参加了。这个区有许多地是耙一遍就可以保住墒、能播种的，可是因为没有人领导，耙的很少，已经造成很大损失。    （金振甲）
