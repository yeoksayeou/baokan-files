    Li Guijin's Victory in the Struggle Against Feudal Marriage
          Huang Yunqin
    Li Guijin is from Xin'an Township, Guangchang County, Jiangxi Province. Before liberation, her family rented a few mu of land from the landlord, and they were in debt every year, living a very hard life. Guijin was smart and capable, and able to endure hardship. When she was a child, she helped her parents with herding cattle and collecting manure. Her parents, because the family was poor and couldn't afford to raise her, discussed: "It's better to borrow a dou than to reduce a mouth. A daughter is always someone else's person, so it's better to find her a husband early." In this way, when Guijin was eleven years old, she was betrothed to Wu Hesheng, a middle peasant from Huixin Township, to be his wife. Her parents received more than 300 counterfeit French currency from the Wu family. In 1950, when Guijin was only fifteen years old, the Wu family came to carry her away in a sedan chair. She cried bitterly and refused to go. Her father said, "Go! We don't have the money to pay them back!" Her mother also said, "Daughter! You can't grow old by your mother's side, you'll always have to go. When you get to their house, you have to be patient and obedient to your mother-in-law and husband." That December, Guijin was carried away.

    Guijin had never left home, and after marrying, she thought of her parents every day. On the fifth day after entering the family, she saw a young nephew from her mother's village passing by the door, so she hurried over to talk to him and ask how her parents were doing at home. When she returned home, she had just stepped into the room when her husband slapped her four times, saying that she shouldn't talk to men. Guijin was angry and sad after being beaten, but this time she didn't dare to resist. Her mother-in-law was also bad to Guijin. At fifteen years old, she had to do everything: carry water, cook, wash clothes, chop firewood, and also do work in the fields. Her mother-in-law still said it wasn't good enough, and often found fault to beat and scold her. She wanted to go back to her parents' home, but she didn't dare, and she had nowhere to vent her grievances. After two months, Guijin was so tortured that her face turned yellow and she lost her energy, sometimes just staring blankly. One day, the neighbors were arranging a marriage (meeting between a man and woman before engagement), and many people were gathered there. Guijin said a word on the side, which was heard by her husband and mother-in-law, who dragged her home and beat her severely. They also falsely accused Guijin of stealing clothes. Guijin couldn't bear it anymore, so she said, "Let's go to the People's Government to reason things out!" This further angered the Wu family, who all swarmed up, aggressively saying, "Does the government even care if a husband beats his wife? We don't need state law, we have clan law!" Large and small fists, door bars, and carrying poles all came at her. When Guijin saw that things were not good, she ran back to her parents' home.

    Guijin fled back to her parents' home and fell into her mother's arms, crying and refusing to return to her husband's home. Her mother saw that Guijin was covered in bruises and stroked her, feeling sad. Guijin proposed a divorce, but her mother didn't say anything. Her father lost his temper and struck down with his smoking pipe. At this time, Wu Hesheng arrived with militiamen Wu Yunxi and Wu Helong, and tricked Guijin into going to the township People's Government to resolve the matter. Who knew that halfway there, Wu Hesheng insisted that she return to her husband's home. They pushed and pulled, but Guijin struggled and refused to go. When Wu Hesheng saw that Guijin wouldn't go, he simply pushed her to the ground, and the three of them dragged her by her feet. Guijin shouted and screamed, and the skin on her scalp and back was rubbed bloody. She was dragged to the edge of a ditch, where Wu Hesheng kicked Guijin into the ditch. Guijin's nose bled, and she was soaked in water, shivering with cold. When Guijin was dragged back to her husband's home, she was covered in a mixture of water, mud, and blood. The militiamen also surrounded her, with one saying, "Why do you want a divorce? Who taught you?" Another said, "Take out the stolen clothes!" Still others said, "If you don't speak, we'll burn you with incense!" Guijin ignored them and finally said, "I'd rather go to jail in the district government than be tortured in this house! If I die here, no one will speak up for me!" Wu Hesheng gave a signal, and several militiamen swarmed up and pushed Guijin into the cattle pen and locked her up. The cattle pen was dark, smelly, and cold. When it got dark, Wu Hesheng still didn't let her out. The old woman, Sister-in-law Hou Ji, who lived next door, couldn't bear to watch, so she helped to plead for her release. The militiamen threatened the old woman, saying, "If something happens later, you'll be responsible!" The old woman couldn't bear the responsibility, so she sent Guijin back to Wu Hesheng's home. In the evening, even more people came to "interrogate" her, mostly militiamen, saying things like "Poor and hired peasant wives don't get divorced," and "Why can't a bought wife be beaten!" It didn't end until late at night. After that, she was imprisoned during the day and struggled against at night, but Guijin never yielded.

    On the fifth day after Guijin was imprisoned, she seized an opportunity and ran out, going straight to the district People's Government to request a divorce. The district government summoned Wu Hesheng. Wu Hesheng resolutely refused to divorce, and instead demanded that Guijin "list her conditions." Guijin said, "I can't stand being beaten and scolded!" The district cadres couldn't mediate the matter, so they referred them to the People's Court for handling. Guijin lived at her parents' home from then on, running to the court every day, a round trip of forty li each time. However, because Wu Hesheng refused to come, the court couldn't conduct an investigation in a timely manner. Guijin often had to wait half a day, and couldn't get home until night. The road was dark, she was hungry, and there was no hope of a divorce judgment. She once attempted suicide. But when she thought of the Marriage Law promulgated by Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, and the joy of walking out of the court with a divorce certificate, she mustered up the courage to fight again. She ran back and forth like this more than ten times, and after more than three months, in May 1951, she finally obtained a divorce decree. Guijin held the judgment in both hands, and a smile appeared on her yellow face.

    Wu Hesheng was furious when he received the divorce decree. He tore up the decree and brought militiamen to arrest Guijin again. When Guijin saw them coming, she hid in the mountains. Wu Hesheng was still unwilling to give up, and came again with six or seven militiamen a few days later. Guijin thought, "I'm already divorced, what am I afraid of! I'll reason with him!" Guijin walked out of the house, and it happened that Comrade Li from the district was also there, so she thought it would be even easier to talk. They all stood in front of the door by a smelly ditch and asked Comrade Li to judge the matter. Who knew that the one surnamed Li said:
  "There's no reason for a divorce!" Guijin was very angry when she heard this, and retorted, "If there's no reason, then how could the court have granted me a divorce?" The one surnamed Li told her to take out the judgment. Guijin was afraid that they would tear it up, so she refused to take it out. The one surnamed Li gave an order to the militiamen, saying, "Tie her back!" Guijin thought that this was not good. If she was tied back, it would undoubtedly be the old methods again: hanging, beating, struggling, locking her in the cattle pen, followed by endless suffering. She wanted to escape, but she saw militiamen on both sides, and Wu Hesheng was coming from the opposite side with a rope. Behind her was a dirty ditch six or seven feet wide. Guijin didn't know where the strength came from, but she jumped over it in one go. The militiamen were caught off guard, so they quickly chased after her. They went around the ditch and chased her into the mountains, chasing her for ten li, but they couldn't catch her by the time it got dark. It turned out that Guijin had escaped up the mountain and hid in the thickets. After the militiamen left, she climbed out of the thickets and followed the small path to the court. The comrades at the court comforted her and locked up Wu Hesheng.

    After Wu Hesheng was locked up, his mother came to find Li Guijin. At first, she used soft tactics, saying to Guijin, "Guijin, a person should have a conscience, come back with me!" Guijin didn't go, so she said, "Hesheng is already in jail, aren't you satisfied? He won't dare to beat you again after he comes out." Guijin still didn't go. The old woman saw that this method didn't work, so she cried and shouted, attracting the villagers to come and watch. Some old people sympathized with her and scolded Guijin; some advised Guijin to go back with her. Guijin didn't say a word. The old woman cried while secretly watching Guijin's expression, knowing that this trick wouldn't work either, so she cried and looked for a rope to hang herself. Everyone pulled her and tried to save her. Guijin was afraid that something would happen, so she ran to the court for advice. The comrades at the court comforted her and told her to persuade the old woman to go back. When she returned home, the old woman saw that Guijin still refused to go back, so she cried and made a scene again, and finally ran out of the house and threw herself into the pond. Guijin's parents were frightened, and while trying to rescue her, they scolded, "We told you to go back, but you wouldn't, and now you're going to pay for someone else's life!" The old woman was quickly rescued. Guijin's father didn't say a word, and his face was very ugly. Guijin's father was an honest farmer, but he had very strong feudal ideas. He loved his sixteen-year-old daughter, but he also felt that since he had used the other family's money, his daughter should be under the control of her husband's family. Divorce was a disgrace and immoral, and he was even more afraid that this matter would lead to death. Guijin persuaded her father, saying, "The government is in charge, and any problem can be solved!" She also asked her brother to report to the court. The next day, people from the court came, criticized the old woman, told her that Wu Hesheng had been released, explained the policies, and said that she could appeal if she disagreed. After listening, the old woman pursed her lips and left.

    Sure enough, after Wu Hesheng was released, he and his mother appealed to the prefectural court (at that time, it was the Ningdu Branch of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Court). After about a month, the prefectural court sent two people to investigate. They listened to Wu Hesheng's one-sided account and also held mass meetings in two townships, criticizing Guijin for having no reason for divorce. Guijin was anxious and busy refuting, which made the two cadres angry. Their faces turned red and they said, "If you can get a divorce, then we'll go home!" They later told the teachers at the civil school, "Li Guijin cannot get a divorce, but now we have to wait for the judgment from the prefectural court. If it judges that she can divorce, then she can divorce, but if it judges that she can't divorce, then she has to go back to the Wu family. If she doesn't go, she might even be shot!" The investigation ended like this. This investigation gave some people who opposed Guijin a "reason," and they ridiculed Guijin when they saw her, saying, "Humph! Divorce, how is it now? The county court's judgment doesn't count! Only the prefecture can decide!" Guijin ignored them, but she was very anxious.

    One day, two days, one week, two weeks, Li Guijin and Wu Hesheng were both waiting for the judgment from the prefectural court. After more than two months, on the morning of one day in September, Li Guijin's father received the judgment. The neighbors also gathered around, and everyone nervously opened the judgment. A literate youth immediately found the judgment column and exclaimed, "Divorce granted!" Everyone's mood immediately relaxed. A stone fell from Li Guijin's heart. But Wu Hesheng refused to accept the judgment of the prefectural court and appealed to the Jiangxi Provincial People's Court.

    In December, the judgment from the Provincial People's Court also came down. In addition to agreeing with the judgment of the prefectural court, it also sentenced Wu Hesheng to two months of hard labor because he violated human rights and disregarded the law, and continued to persecute the woman after the divorce. This time, the people who sympathized with Guijin were relieved, and Li Guijin's anxiety for several months was now completely calmed down. The rumors and gossips also slowly subsided. Guijin's field was returned to her mother's family, where she lived and worked. Everyone admired her for her firm struggle, and the young people took her as an example to learn from. During the land reform review, Guijin was elected by the masses as a women's representative. Now, Guijin is very happy, and she has regained the vitality and beauty she had before marriage.

    李桂金反对封建婚姻的斗争取得了胜利
          黄韵琴
    李桂金是江西省广昌县新安乡人。解放前，家里租种着地主的几亩田地，年年出租还债，生活很苦。桂金长得聪明伶俐，又能吃苦耐劳，小时候就帮着爹娘放牛、拾粪。爹娘因为家里穷，养活不起她，就商量说：“借一斗不如减一口，女儿总是人家的人，不如早给她寻个婆家。”就这样，桂金十一岁的时候，许配给回辛乡中农吴和升做老婆，爹娘得了吴家的三百多块伪法币。一九五○年，桂金才十五岁，吴家用轿子来抬她。她哭得死去活来，怎么也不肯去。爹说：“去吧！我们没钱还人家！”娘也说：“女儿呀！你不能在娘身边长老，总得要去的。到了人家家里，一切要忍耐，好好顺从婆婆和丈夫。”那年十二月，桂金被抬走了。
    桂金没离过家，出嫁后天天想爹娘。过门第五天，她在门口看见娘家村里的一个年青侄子路过，就赶过去说话，问问爹娘在家怎样了。回到家，刚迈进房门，丈夫就打了她四个耳光，说她不该和男人说话。桂金挨了打，又气又难过，可是这次没敢反抗。婆婆对桂金也不好。十五岁的人，挑水，做饭，洗衣，砍柴，还有田里的活，什么都得做；婆婆还说这不好，那不好，常常找岔子打骂她。她想回娘家，又不敢，满肚子委屈没处诉说。两个月，桂金被折磨得脸黄了，也没精神了，有时一个人发呆。有一天，邻居正看亲（订婚前男女见面），很多人围在那里，桂金在旁边说了一句话，被丈夫、婆婆听见了，拖回家去，毒打了一顿。他们又诬赖桂金偷走了衣服。桂金实在受不下去，就说：“我们到人民政府去讲理吧！”这一下更惹恼了吴家的人，都哄上来，气势汹汹地说：“老公打老婆还用政府管？不用国法，我们有族法！”大小拳头、门杠、扁担都来了。桂金一看事不好，就跑回娘家去。
    桂金逃回娘家，倒在娘怀里哭，说什么也不肯回婆家。娘看见桂金满身青紫，抚摸着她，心里难过。桂金提出要离婚，娘没有说话，爹发了脾气，拿着烟斗直劈下来。这时，吴和升带着民兵吴云溪、吴和龙赶来，骗桂金到乡人民政府去解决。谁知走到半路，吴和升却非叫她回婆家去不行。他们推的推，拉的拉，桂金挣扎着不去。吴和升见桂金不走，就干脆把她推倒在地上，三个人拖着她的脚走。桂金大喊大叫，头皮和背脊都磨出血来。拖到水沟边，吴和升又一脚把桂金踢下水沟。桂金的鼻子流出了血，混身被水湿透，冷得直打哆嗦。桂金被拖回婆家时，满身的水、泥和血混成了一团。民兵又围上来，这个说：“你为什么要离婚？谁教你的？”那个说：“偷的衣服拿出来！”更有的说：“不说就用香火烧！”桂金不理他们，最后说：“宁愿到区政府坐牢，也不能在这个家里受刑！在这里死了也没人给伸冤！”吴和升一示意，几个民兵一哄而上，把桂金推进牛栏锁了起来。牛栏里又黑、又臭、又冷。天黑了，吴和升还不放她出来。隔壁的侯纪嫂老婆婆实在看不下去，就帮着说情，要把桂金“保”出来。民兵威胁老婆婆说：“以后出了事，你要负责！”老婆婆负不起这个责任，把桂金送到吴和升的家里。晚上，来“审问”的人更多了，大部分是民兵，说什么“贫雇农老婆没有离婚的”，“买来的老婆怎么不能打”！直到深夜才罢休。以后，白天监禁，晚上斗争，但桂金始终没有屈服。
    桂金被监禁后的第五天，瞅了个空子，跑了出来，一直到区人民政府要求离婚。区政府把吴和升传来。吴和升坚决不离婚，反要桂金“数条件”。桂金说：“受打骂，吃不消！”区干部调解不下这件事，就把他们介绍到人民法院去处理。桂金从此住在娘家，天天往法院跑，每次来回四十里。但是，因为吴和升不肯来，法院也不能及时作调查，桂金常常一等半天，夜里才能到家。路又黑，肚又饿，什么时候判决离婚也没有希望，她曾企图自杀。但她想到毛主席颁布的婚姻法，想到共产党、人民政府，想到拿到离婚证走出法院时的愉快，又鼓起了斗争的勇气。这样跑了十多次，过了三个多月，到一九五一年五月间终于判决离婚。桂金拿到判决书，双手抱着，黄黄的脸上出现了笑容。
    吴和升拿到离婚判决书，可气坏了。他一把把判决书撕掉，又带着民兵来捉桂金。桂金见他们来了，躲到山上去。吴和升还不甘心，几天后又带着六、七个民兵来了。桂金想：“我已经离婚，怕他什么！和他讲理去！”桂金走出门外，正好区上的李同志也在场，心想那就更好说了。他们都站在门前一条臭水沟旁请李同志评理。谁知姓李的却说：
  “离婚没理由！”桂金一听很生气，反问说：“没理由，那法院怎么会判决我离呢？”姓李的让她拿出判决书来。桂金怕被他们撕掉，不肯拿出来。姓李的就下命令给民兵说：“把她捆回去吧！”桂金一想不好，捆回去不用说又是老法子，吊、打、斗争、关牛栏，接着就是过不完的苦日子。她想逃，一看两边都是民兵，吴和升又从对面拿着绳子来了。身后是一条六、七尺宽的脏水沟，桂金不知那里来的一股劲，一下就跳过去了。民兵们没提防，就赶快追，等绕过水沟，追到山上，一直追了十里路，天黑了也没赶上。原来桂金逃上山躲在荆棘丛中，等民兵回去后，才爬出荆棘，顺着小路到了法院。法院的同志安慰了她一番，将吴和升关了起来。
    吴和升被关起来，婆婆来找李桂金。开始用软手段，对桂金说：“桂金，一个人要有良心，跟我回去吧！”桂金不去，她又说：“和升已经坐了牢你还不心甘？出来后他不敢再打你了。”桂金还是不去。老婆子看见这个办法行不通，就又哭又喊，惹得村上群众都来看。有些老年人同情她，骂桂金；有的劝桂金和她一块回去。桂金一声不响。老婆子一边哭一边偷看桂金的神气，知道这一套也不行，就哭着找绳子上吊。大家拉的拉，救的救，桂金怕出事，跑到法院求主意。法院的同志安慰她一番，叫她好好劝老婆子回去。回到家，老婆子见桂金仍不肯回去，又哭闹起来，最后跑出门投了塘。桂金的爹妈吓坏了，一边急救一边骂：“叫你回去不肯回去，现在可要抵人家的命了！”老婆子很快就被救起来了。桂金的爹一言不发，脸色很难看。桂金的爹是个老实农民，就是封建思想很浓厚，他疼爱十六岁的女儿，但又觉得使了人家的钱，女儿应该受婆家管，离婚是败坏名声和不道德的事，更怕为了这事闹出人命。桂金劝爹说：“有政府给作主，什么问题也能解决！”她又求哥哥到法院报告。第二天，法院来了人，批评了老婆子，告诉老婆子说吴和升已放出来，又讲明政策，说明不服可以上诉。老婆子听了，把嘴一噘就走了。
    果真，吴和升被放出后，和母亲上告到专区法院（当时是江西省人民法院宁都分院）。约摸一个多月，专区法院派了两个人来调查。他们听了吴和升的片面之词，还召开了两个乡的群众大会，批评桂金离婚没有理由。桂金着急，忙着辩驳，惹得那两个干部发了火，红涨着脸说：“你能离了婚，那我们就回家了！”他们后来还对民校教员说：“李桂金是不能离婚的，不过现在还得等专区法院的判决书下来，若判决离，就可以离，若判决不离，她就得回吴家去。要是她不去，要枪毙还说不定！”调查就这样结束了。这次调查，给一些反对桂金的人抓住了“理”，见着桂金就讽刺：“哼！离婚，现在怎么样？县法院判了不算！专区才能决定呢！”桂金不理会，但心里很着急。
    一天、两天，一星期、两星期，李桂金、吴和升都在盼着专区法院的判决书。一直过了两个多月，在九月的一天上午，李桂金的父亲接到判决书。邻居也围了上来，大家紧张地打开了判决书。一个识字的青年一下找到了判决栏，夺口念出“准许离婚！”四个字。大家的心情立刻松下来了。李桂金心里的一块石头落了地。但吴和升却不服专区法院的判决，又上告到江西省人民法院。
    十二月，省人民法院的判决书也下来了，除同意专区法院的判决外，还判了吴和升二个月的苦工，因为他侵犯人权，目无法纪，离婚以后还去迫害女方。这一下，同情桂金的人们都放了心，李桂金几个月来的不安，现在才完全平静下来。风言风语也慢慢平息了。桂金的田拨回娘家，在娘家生活和劳动。大家佩服她能坚决斗争，青年人更以她为学习的榜样。当地土地改革复查时，桂金被群众选为妇女代表。现在，桂金精神很愉快，她恢复了婚前的活泼和健美。
