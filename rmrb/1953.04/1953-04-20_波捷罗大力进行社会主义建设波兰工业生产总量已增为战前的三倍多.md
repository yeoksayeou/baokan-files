Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 16th - The industrialization of the People's Republic of Poland has achieved tremendous success. According to TASS, Poland's total industrial production has now more than tripled compared to pre-war levels. Calculated per capita, the level of industrial production has increased more than fourfold compared to pre-war levels. New factories are starting production every year. In 1952 alone, 450 large and medium-sized factories were newly completed across the country. Priority has been given to the development of major socialist industrial sectors such as coal, metallurgy, electricity, and machine manufacturing.

    Poland's coal production, calculated per capita, is now three times that of pre-war levels. In 1951, Poland's coal production jumped to fifth place in the world, surpassing capitalist countries such as France and Belgium, and increased to 84.5 million tons in 1952.

    Poland's steel industry production, calculated per capita, has now reached 120 kilograms per person, nearly triple the pre-war 43 kilograms. By the completion of the Six-Year Plan (1949-1955), this figure will exceed 170 kilograms.

    Poland's electricity production, calculated per capita, has now reached four times that of pre-war levels. By 1960, when new large power stations are put into operation, this figure will increase to more than ten times that of pre-war levels. At that time, Poland will become one of the largest countries in Europe in terms of electricity production.

    In 1952 alone, Poland's machine manufacturing industry produced more than 100 new types of machine tools and other industrial equipment. It is continuing to develop rapidly.

    Thanks to the Polish people's selfless and creative labor and the Soviet Union's tremendous economic assistance, Poland's industry has achieved such rapid development. Its level of industrial production has now caught up with or exceeded many capitalist countries. For example, Italy's industrial production volume was two and a half times that of Poland before the war, but as early as the beginning of 1951, Poland's industrial production volume exceeded Italy's by 20 percent.

    Xinhua News Agency: Pravda recently published a dispatch from Prague by B. Tarasov, describing the economic development and industrialization of Slovakia.

    Tarasov said: In the past, under the rule of the bourgeoisie and landlords of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia was an agricultural region, and the lives of the working people in this region were very miserable. Now, Slovakia is a huge construction site. Under the care of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, Slovakia's economic level will be raised to the level of the industrially developed regions of western Czechoslovakia. Last year alone, 322 new industrial units in Slovakia started production. The rapid development of Slovakia's industry has greatly changed the proportion of industry and agriculture in the region. By the end of this year, Slovakia's industrial production will account for 65 percent of its national economy. Slovakia is becoming an important machine manufacturing area. In 1952, Slovakia's industrial output increased by 24 percent compared to 1951.

    Tarasov described: In northern, southern, and eastern Slovakia, scaffolding and cranes can be seen everywhere at the entrances of new mines. Large and small hydropower stations are being built on the banks of the Váh, Orava, and Hron rivers. In one year, Slovakia's power generation will be equal to the entire power generation of Czechoslovakia in 1937.

    Xinhua News Agency: The Romanian people are accelerating socialist construction, and the total investment in capital construction this year will increase by 32 percent compared to last year.

    In the Dobruja region of southeastern Romania, the Danube-Black Sea Canal project, which was decided to be excavated in 1949, is being accelerated. Many advanced work teams have overfulfilled the first quarter plan for 1953, some reaching 136 percent of the original target. Soviet machinery and equipment for excavating the canal continue to be transported to the construction site in a steady stream. The newly arrived state-of-the-art Soviet giant floating crane can lift 50 tons. Currently, the level of mechanization of construction work has reached 89.26 percent of all work.

    In the Moldavia region of northeastern Romania, the country's largest hydroelectric power station is being built along the banks of the Bistrița River. This is the Lenin Hydroelectric Power Station, which will have a generating capacity of 220,000 kilowatts. Currently, its reservoir is nearing completion, and the walls of the power plant have been erected high. Construction workers will complete the waterway that diverts the huge flow of the Bistrița River to turn the power plant's turbines this year. Workers are using a large number of construction machines and equipment transported from the Soviet Union. The complete set of Soviet bulldozers, road graders, excavators, trucks, and concrete plants alone can replace the manual labor of 6,500 people. Thousands of workers on the construction site enthusiastically launched a labor competition, and many work teams digging the waterway outlet are already working on the work quota for May or June.

    In the Hunedoara region of western Romania, at the site of the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Steel Combine, after the completion of the No. 6 blast furnace last year, construction workers are building a thermal power station. This power station is expected to be completed and start generating electricity this year.

    While carrying out these and other socialist construction projects, Romania has also built and is building thousands of new and comfortable workers' residences. This year's construction cost for workers' residences will reach 580 million lei (Romanian currency), which is double that of 1952.

    波捷罗大力进行社会主义建设波兰工业生产总量已增为战前的三倍多
    【新华社十六日讯】波兰人民共和国的工业化获得了巨大成就。据塔斯社华沙讯，现在波兰的工业生产总量已增为战前的三倍多，按人口平均计算，工业生产水平已经提高到战前的四倍多。年年都有新建的工厂开工生产。在一九五二年一年，全国新落成的大、中型工厂就有四百五十座。煤炭、冶金、电力和机器制造工业这些社会主义工业主要部门的生产得到优先的发展。
    波兰煤炭的产量，按人口平均计算，现在已经达到战前的三倍。波兰的煤产量在一九五一年即已跃居世界第五位，超过了法国和比利时这些资本主义国家，在一九五二年增加到八千四百五十万吨。
    波兰钢铁工业的产量，按人口平均计算，现在已达每人一百二十公斤，比战前的四十三公斤差不多增加了两倍。到六年计划（一九四九年—一九五五年）完成时，这个数字将超过一百七十公斤。
    波兰电力生产量，按人口平均计算，现在已经达到战前的四倍。到一九六○年新的巨大电力站都开工发电后，这一数字将增为战前的十倍以上。那时，波兰在电力生产上将成为欧洲最大的国家之一。
    波兰的机器制造工业仅在一九五二年一年内就生产了一百多种新型的工作母机和其他工业设备。现在还在继续迅速发展中。
    由于波兰人民忘我的创造性劳动和苏联巨大的经济援助，波兰的工业获得了这样迅速的发展。现在它的工业生产水平已经赶上或超过许多资本主义国家。例如：意大利的工业生产量战前为波兰的二倍半，而早在一九五一年初，波兰的工业生产量就超过意大利百分之二十了。
    据新华社讯：真理报最近刊载了布·塔拉索夫的布拉格通讯，叙述斯洛伐克经济发展和工业化的情况。
    塔拉索夫说：过去在捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级和地主统治下，斯洛伐克是一个农业区，而且这地区的劳动人民的生活非常痛苦。而现在，斯洛伐克是一个巨大的施工现场。在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的关怀下，斯洛伐克的经济水平将提高到捷克斯洛伐克西部工业发达的地区的水平。单在去年，斯洛伐克就有三百二十二个新的工业单位开工生产。斯洛伐克工业的迅速发展大大地改变了这个地区工农业的比重。到今年年底，斯洛伐克的工业生产将占它的国民经济的百分之六十五。斯洛伐克正变成一个重要的机器制造区。一九五二年，斯洛伐克的工业产量比一九五一年增加了百分之二十四。
    塔拉索夫描述道：在斯洛伐克的北部、南部和东部到处可以看到新矿井口上的支架和起重机。在发格河、奥拉瓦河和赫隆河河畔正在建设大大小小的水电站。一年后，斯洛伐克的发电量将等于捷克斯洛伐克在一九三七年的全部发电量。
    据新华社讯：罗马尼亚人民加速进行社会主义建设，今年基本建设的投资总额将比去年增多百分之三十二。
    在罗马尼亚东南部多布鲁查地区，一九四九年决定开凿的多瑙河—黑海运河工程正在加速进行。许多先进的工作队都超额完成了一九五三年第一季度计划，有的达到原定任务的百分之一百三十六。开凿运河用的苏联机器和设备继续源源不断地运到工地上来。新运到的最新式的苏联巨型水上起重机可以举重五十吨。现在，建筑工作机械化的水平已经达到全部工作的百分之八十九点二六。
    在罗马尼亚东北部的摩尔达维亚地区，沿着俾斯特里塔河的两岸，正在建筑全国最大的水力发电站。这就是发电能力将为二十二万瓩的列宁水力发电站。目前它的蓄水池即将完工，电力厂的墙垣已经高高筑起。建筑工人们要在今年内完成输送俾斯特里塔河的巨流来转动电力厂透平的水道。工人们大量地使用着从苏联运来的建筑机器和装备。单是苏联的铲土机、开路机、挖掘机、卡车和混凝土工厂的全套设备，就可以代替六千五百个人的手工劳动。工地上成千的工人热烈地展开了劳动竞赛，挖掘水道出口的许多工作队已经在作五月份或六月份的工作定额。
    在罗马尼亚西部洪尼多阿拉地区，在乔治乌—德治钢铁联合企业所在地，继去年完成了第六号大鼓风炉之后，建筑工人又在建筑一座热力发电站。这座发电站预计今年即可完工并开始发电。
    在进行这些和其他社会主义建设工程的同时，罗马尼亚还建筑了而且建筑着数以千计的新式舒适的工人住宅。今年的工人住宅建筑费将达五亿八千万列伊（罗币），等于一九五二年的两倍。
