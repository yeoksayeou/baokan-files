Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th—Following the transfer of seven British civilians to Soviet representatives, allowing them to return home, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea accepted the Soviet government's March 26th proposal to mediate the return of French civilians detained in North Korea to their home country. They transferred fourteen French civilians to Soviet representatives, enabling them to return home. The fourteen French civilians are: Georges Béllucci, former Chargé d'Affaires of the French Embassy in Seoul; Jean Medemol, former Vice-Consul of France in Seoul; Charles Madel, former attaché of the French Embassy in Seoul; Maurice Chantrenne, former Agence France-Presse correspondent in Seoul; Célestin Sauvageot, former French missionary in Seoul; Sister Marie Delobel; Sister Henriette Maguet; Sister Marie Des Gassot; Sister Irène Desmaurais; Henriette Massoué, family member; Marguerite Madel, family member; Charlotte Glaize, family member; Huang Ximeng, family member; Huang Wansheng, family member.

These French civilians resided in South Korea before the war and were detained by the Korean side during the war. Before their release and departure for home, they met with reporters from Pyongyang newspapers, the Korean Central News Agency, and foreign journalists stationed in Pyongyang. In their statements to the reporters, they all expressed deep gratitude to the Korean government for the humanitarian treatment they received.

Georges Béllucci, former Chargé d'Affaires of the French Embassy in Seoul, said: "I am very happy that the Korean government is enabling us to return home." He said, "American planes have destroyed all the cities and many rural areas in North Korea. Under these circumstances, the Korean government consistently provided us with clean and warm accommodations, always located far from dangerous bombing zones." He also recounted the other ways in which the Korean government provided them with humanitarian treatment. He said, "The Korean government's good treatment and care for us fills us with deep gratitude."

Célestin Sauvageot, former French missionary in Seoul, said: "During World War II, I personally witnessed the brutal destruction of my country by Hitler's Germany. What I see today in the destruction of Korea shows that the barbarity of the Korean people's enemies exceeds that of the Hitlerite bandits by several times. In North Korea, I deeply felt how much of a crime against human conscience the indiscriminate bombing by American planes of the rear areas inhabited by the elderly, women, and children is. I sincerely abhor these criminal acts. At the same time, I am indescribably moved by the tenacity and bravery displayed by the Korean people as they fight amidst such painful rubble."

Sister Henriette Maguet said: "Today, all the people of the world hate war and desire peace. The people's united desire for peace shatters the shameful adventures of those who attempt to expand the war. I am convinced that the Korean people love peace. The Korean people not only desire peace, but are fighting to maintain it." Maurice Chantrenne, former Agence France-Presse correspondent, said: "All those who have visited Korea have reported on the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the destructive actions of the Americans. What I will convey to the French people is the same feeling that everything conscientious people will have when they see the facts in Korea."

Marguerite Madel, who resided in Japan for fifteen years and has been in Korea for fifty years, said that after returning to her home country, she would introduce the Korean people's struggle for peace to the French people. She said that the Korean people's struggle will surely inspire the French people to fight for peace.

Sisters Marie Delobel, Marie Des Gassot, and Irène Desmaurais all said that during their time in North Korea, they did not experience any interference or restrictions in their religious beliefs.

In their statements, these French civilians also requested that their thanks for the humanitarian treatment of the Korean government be conveyed to the entire Korean people.

    被释放的法国平民向朝鲜及外国记者发表谈话
    深切感谢朝鲜政府给予的人道主义待遇
    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在把英国平民七名移交给苏联代表使他们得以回国之后，又接受苏联政府三月二十六日提出的关于使被扣留在北朝鲜的法国平民返回本国的斡旋建议，将法国平民十四名移交给苏联代表，使他们得以返回本国。这十四个法国平民是：前法国驻汉城公使馆代办乔治·贝卢希、前法国驻汉城副领事让·梅德摩、前法国驻汉城公使馆随员夏尔·马代尔、前法新社驻汉城记者莫里斯·项特鲁、前法国在汉城传教士锡莱斯登·索瓦奥、修女玛丽·德洛比、修女亨利爱特·马吉埃、修女玛丽·戴斯加索、修女伊朗娜·德莫里、家属亨利爱特·马苏埃、家属玛格丽特·马代尔、家属夏洛特·格莱斯、家属黄西蒙、家属黄万生。
    这些法国平民在战争以前居留在南朝鲜，在战争时期被扣留在朝方。他们在被释放启程回国之前，曾和平壤各报记者、朝鲜中央通讯社记者以及驻平壤的外国记者们会见。他们在对记者发表的谈话中，都深切感谢朝鲜政府给予他们的人道主义待遇。
    前法国驻汉城公使馆代办乔治·贝卢希说：“朝鲜政府使我们得以回国，我感到很高兴。”他说：“美国飞机破坏了北朝鲜的所有城市和许多农村，在这种情况下，朝鲜政府仍然一贯供给我们干净而温暖的住所，而且都是住在离轰炸危险地带很远的地方。”他并叙述了朝鲜政府在其他方面对他们的人道主义待遇。他说：“朝鲜政府对我们的良好的待遇和关怀，特别使我们怀着深切的感激。”
    前法国在汉城传教士锡莱斯登·索瓦奥说：“在第二次大战时期，我亲眼看到我国被希特勒德国残酷破坏的情形。今天我看到的朝鲜被破坏的情况，说明朝鲜人民的敌人的野蛮，比希特勒匪帮还超过了好几倍。我在北朝鲜深深地感觉到：美国飞机对有老人、妇女和儿童居住的后方肆意的轰炸，是多么刺激人类良心的罪行。我真心憎恶这些犯罪行为，同时，我看到朝鲜人民在如此惨痛的瓦砾堆中进行战斗时表现的坚韧和勇敢，这使我受到了无法形容的感动。”
    修女亨利爱特·马吉埃说：“今天，全世界人民不论谁都憎恶战争，并且愿望和平。人民对和平的一致愿望，粉碎了那些企图扩大战争的可耻冒险。我确信：朝鲜人民是热爱和平的。朝鲜人民不仅愿望和平，而且正在为维护和平而战斗着。”前法新社记者莫里斯·项特鲁说：“所有访问过朝鲜的人们，都报道过朝鲜人民的英雄斗争和美国人的破坏行为。我将要对法国人民传达的就是一切有良心的人们对于在朝鲜看到的事实都会引起的同样的感情。”
    在日本居留过十五年、到朝鲜已有五十年的玛格丽特·马代尔说：她回到本国后，要对法国人民介绍朝鲜人民为争取和平而进行的斗争。她说：朝鲜人民的斗争必将鼓舞法国人民为和平而斗争。
    修女玛丽·德洛比、玛丽·戴斯加索和伊朗娜·德莫里都说，在北朝鲜的期间，她们在宗教信仰方面，没有受到任何干涉和限制。
    这些法国平民在谈话中，并要求把他们对于朝鲜政府的人道主义待遇所表示的谢意，转达给全体朝鲜人民。
