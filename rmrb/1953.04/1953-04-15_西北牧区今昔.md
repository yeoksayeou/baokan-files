The Beautiful and Rich Grassland

In the northwest corner of the motherland, on the Pamir Plateau, in the Qaidam Basin, at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, and in the Alxa League, there are vast grasslands. Nearly twenty ethnic minorities live in Northwest China, with a population of approximately 6.3 million, most of whom engage in animal husbandry. Although spring arrives relatively late here, the grass has already begun to turn green. Stallions neigh, calves frolic, flocks of sheep walk peacefully, and camel caravans stretching for several miles slowly transport various goods. Colorful tents are pitched along the rivers. Herdsmen, dressed in dazzling red and green attire, ride tall horses, waving long whips, and their melodious and cheerful songs echo across the vast grasslands.

These fertile grasslands nurture hundreds and thousands of cattle and sheep. According to 1951 statistics, the northwest pastoral area had over 25.1 million sheep, over 4.13 million cattle, over 1.1 million horses, over 1.88 million donkeys and mules, and 178,000 camels. These precious livestock not only provide favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production but also produce over 48.6 million catties of wool annually, 1.8 million catties of camel hair that is eight or nine inches long, over 8.22 million pieces of various hides, and over 4.32 million sheep casings. These livestock products are important raw materials for the wool textile and leather industries. In addition, the grasslands also produce many valuable medicinal materials, such as antler velvet, musk, rhubarb, angelica, codonopsis, wolfberry, notopterygium, and various wild animal skins, which were once famous in domestic and international markets. How beautiful and rich are the vast grasslands of Northwest China!

Bitter Days in the Past

The reactionary rule of past dynasties, especially the reactionary rule of the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs for decades before liberation, caused the people working on this beautiful and rich grassland to live a tragic, dark, poor, and ignorant life.

In the northwest pastoral areas, the livestock products and other local and special products, except for a small amount retained by the herdsmen for their own use, were mostly sold to exchange for grain and other necessities. Before liberation, branches of bureaucratic capital were spread throughout the large and small towns in Northwest China, monopolizing trade, buying livestock products at low prices, and selling industrial products at high prices. In Qinghai, the wool produced by fifty sheep in a year could only be exchanged for one brick of tea, and in Ningxia, one camel could only be exchanged for one bolt of cloth. The two sentences "Fully loaded into the city, returning empty-handed, sweating when going, shivering when returning" are enough to illustrate this situation of unequal exchange. The reactionaries, fearing that the pastoral people would "rebel," densely built bunkers and checkpoints, implementing a blockade of the pastoral areas, causing many local and special products that were popular at home and abroad to be difficult to sell, resulting in sheep wool not being sheared, sheep intestines being fed to dogs, ten-branched jade (angelica) being burned as firewood, Ningxia's wolfberries being fed to pigs, and seedless white raisins in Turpan being left to rot. On the other hand, the raw materials for China's wool textile industry were Australian wool; and American black raisins flooded the Chinese market.

The reactionary派’s exorbitant taxes, conscription, and extortion caused even greater disasters in the pastoral areas. In Ningxia Province, more than 240,000 people of various ethnic groups died in the wilderness or fled to other places from 1938 to 1947.

In order to implement the conspiracy of "divide and rule," the reactionaries deliberately created ethnic disputes, causing the people of all ethnic groups to be trapped in the bitter sea of ​​hatred,械斗, and mutual looting for a long time. The Chiang and Ma bandit gangs also directly carried out massacres and plunders against the people of all ethnic groups. For example, when twenty-four tribes (部落) in the Yushu Tibetan area of ​​Qinghai were "blood-washed" by the Qinghai Ma bandits in 1941, the Xiuma and Bairimeima tribes (部落) alone had more than 400 people killed, over 100,000 sheep, over 80,000 cattle, over 30,000 horses, and temples, monasteries,土房, and tents were all burned down. Of the more than 1,000 lamas in the Laxiu Temple, some were killed and some fled, leaving only more than 60 people by the time of liberation. The Laxiu tribe 百户 led all 400余 households of the tribe to flee to Tibet, and only returned after the liberation of Yushu.

At that time, the herdsmen had no intention of production, animal plagues spread everywhere, and large numbers of livestock died. In Gansu Province, 210,000 heads of livestock died of plagues in 1942. In more than ten years, Qinghai's livestock decreased by 54.2 percent; Ningxia's horses decreased by 70 percent, cattle and camels decreased by 50 percent, and sheep decreased by more than 30 percent.

Today's Happy Life

After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government attached great importance to the recovery and development of animal husbandry. Under the general policy of "protecting livestock and rewarding breeding," the herdsmen were mobilized to improve livestock breeding. In 1952, the whole region stored over 2.69 billion catties of grass and over 17.8 million catties of feed. In the same year, Ningxia demarcated over 11,000 square *huali* of rotational grazing grassland, and built 1,495 wells, cisterns, and reservoirs on the grassland. Work such as wolf hunting,棚架 construction, and圈 construction were also carried out. In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the prevention of reclamation and protection of pastures effectively solved the problem of water and grass for livestock and safe wintering. Over the past three years, medical and health enterprises have manufactured 13.35 million cc of various vaccines and serums, and conducted injections and prevention for livestock, basically eliminating diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, and parasites. In terms of regulating breeding livestock, last year alone, more than 129,000 Lanzhou-Hampshire cross-bred sheep were杂交土种 sheep, and various places also selected a large number of 民间良种 for mating, which played a great role in improving the breeds of livestock, increasing wool production, and improving the quality of wool. The People's Bank also issued a large number of animal husbandry loans, which strongly supported the recovery and development of animal husbandry. According to statistics at the end of 1952, compared with the end of 1950, the various livestock in Northwest China increased by 21.54 percent for sheep, 38.6 percent for goats, and 24.27 percent for draft animals. Compared with last year and 1937: sheep recovered to 84.05 percent, goats exceeded 16.73 percent, and draft animals exceeded 26.52 percent. In pure pastoral areas, livestock has more than doubled from liberation to the end of last year. In Alxa League, Ningxia, the number of sheep increased from 150,000 to over 388,900, horses increased from 3,000 to 10,577, and camels increased from 50,000 to over 62,700. Qinghai's wool production last year increased by 60 percent compared with before liberation. Obviously, animal husbandry is rapidly recovering and developing.

The state-owned trade network implemented the policy of serving animal husbandry, conscientiously promoted fair and reasonable and free trade policies, and led legitimate private merchants to purchase large quantities of hides, wool, local products, and special products, supplying grain, cloth, tea, and general merchandise, enlivening the material exchange in the pastoral areas, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups began to improve. In Alxa League, Ningxia, where more than 50,000 Mongolian herdsmen live, the grain, cloth, tea, and general merchandise purchased from the Balanhot Trading Company in the first half of last year were worth more than 143.2 billion yuan. The grain supplied by the Jiuquan Trading Company of Gansu to Tibetan herdsmen was 6,000 catties in 1950, 256,000 catties in 1951, and increased to 720,000 catties in the first half of last year. In Xiahe, Gansu, where more than 50,000 Tibetan herdsmen live, 30,000 bolts of cloth were purchased from the Labrang Trading Company in 1951. The sales of cloth from the Northwest China Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company, especially colored and floral cloth, are on a straight upward trend.

The Communist Party and the People's Government are helping the pastoral people: establishing or preparing to establish autonomous regions and autonomous organs, training a large number of ethnic cadres, mediating ethnic disputes, ending the historical tragedy of ethnic仇杀,剿消ing bandits and counter-revolutionaries, carrying out cultural and health work, and launching a patriotic livestock raising movement. Today's Northwest pastoral area is on the road to prosperity for both people and livestock. Throughout the vast northwest grassland, a folk song of the Kyrgyz herdsmen is popular: The sun warms the Pamir Plateau, Chairman Mao leads us, and each year is better than the last. Horses and sheep are added to the flocks; milk and wool will never run out. The water of the Hun River flows endlessly, and the kindness of Chairman Mao cannot be expressed.

    西北牧区今昔
    柳超
    美丽富饶的草原
    在祖国的西北角，在帕米尔高原，在柴达木盆地，在天山脚下，在阿拉善旗，都有着广袤无垠的草原。西北少数民族近二十种，人口约六百三十万，大部分经营畜牧业。在这里，春天虽然降临得比较迟，但现在牧草已开始发绿了。骏马嘶叫着，牛犊蹦跳着，群羊安祥地走着，长达数里的骆驼队，不慌不忙地运送着各种货物。小河两旁驻扎着各色帐篷。牧民们穿着红红绿绿的耀眼的衣裳，骑着高头大马，手里挥舞着长长的鞭子，嘹亮愉快的歌声，荡漾在辽阔的草原上。
    这些肥沃的草原，牧育着成百成千的牛羊群。据一九五一年的统计，西北牧区有二千五百一十余万只羊，四百一十三万余头牛，一百一十万匹马，一百八十八万头驴和骡，十七万八千峰骆驼。这些珍贵的牲畜，不仅为发展农业生产提供了有利条件，并且年产羊毛四千八百六十余万斤，八、九寸长的骆驼毛一百八十万斤，各种皮子八百二十二万多张，羊肠衣四百三十二万多根。这些畜产品是毛纺织业和制革业的重要原料。此外，草原上还出产许多名贵的药材，如鹿茸、麝香、大黄、当归、党参、枸杞、羌活及各种野兽皮，都曾经是驰名国内外市场的。西北广大草原是多么美丽而富饶啊！
        过去苦难的日子
    历代的反动统治，特别是解放前数十年蒋、马匪帮的反动统治，使劳动在这块美丽而富饶的草原上的人民，过着悲惨、黑暗、贫穷、愚昧的日子。
    西北牧区的畜产品和其他土产、特产，牧民除留少量自用外，绝大部分是卖出换取粮食和其他生活必需品。解放前，官僚资本的分支机构遍布西北大小城镇，垄断了贸易，低价收买畜产品，高价出售工业品。青海五十只羊一年出产的羊毛只能换一块茶砖，宁夏一峰骆驼只能换一匹大布，“满驮进城手提回，去时流汗归时寒。”这两句话足以说明这种不等价交换的情景。反动派惧怕牧区人民“造反”，曾经密布碉堡、关卡，对牧区实行封锁，使牧区许多畅销国内外的土产、特产销路滞塞，造成牧区羊毛不剪、羊肠喂狗，十枝玉（当归）当柴烧，宁夏的枸杞喂了猪，吐鲁番的无核白葡萄干任其腐烂。另一方面我国毛纺织工业的原料却用的是澳大利亚的羊毛；美国的黑葡萄干充斥了我国市场。
    反动派的苛捐杂税、抓兵、勒索，更造成牧区的巨大灾难，宁夏省因而死于荒野及逃往他乡的各族人民，从一九三八年到一九四七年即达二十四万多人。
    反动派为了实行“分而治之”的阴谋，故意制造民族纠纷，使各族人民长期陷于仇视、械斗与互相抢掠的苦海。蒋、马匪帮对各族人民也曾直接进行过屠杀与掠夺，例如一九四一年玉树藏族区二十四族（部落）遭青海马匪“血洗”时，仅休马和白日美马两个族（部落）即有四百多人被杀，被抢去羊十万只，牛八万余头，马三万余匹，庙宇、寺院、土房、帐篷等全部被烧掉。拉秀寺一千多喇嘛，被杀的被杀，逃跑的逃跑，到解放时只剩下六十多个人了。拉秀部落百户，带领着全族四百余户人民逃往西藏，直到玉树解放才回来。
    当时，牧民无心生产，兽疫到处蔓延，牲畜大批死亡，甘肃省在一九四二年死于疫病的牲畜达二十一万头。十多年间，青海牲畜减少百分之五十四点二；宁夏的马减少百分之七十，牛和骆驼减少百分之五十，羊减少百分之三十以上。
        今天的幸福生活
    解放后，共产党和人民政府很重视畜牧业的恢复与发展。在“保护牲畜、奖励繁殖”的总方针下，发动牧民改善牲畜的饲养。一九五二年全区储草二十六亿九千余万斤，储料一千七百八十余万斤，同年宁夏划定轮牧草原一万一千多平方华里，在草原上打井、筑水窖、修涝池一千四百九十五个。还进行了打狼、搭棚、搭圈等工作。在半农半牧区防止开荒、保护牧场，有效地解决了牲畜的水草及安全过冬问题。三年来，医药卫生企业制造各种疫苗血清一千三百三十五万西西，对牲畜进行注射防治，基本上消灭了口蹄疫、炭疽、寄生虫等疫病。在调剂种畜方面，仅去年兰哈羊杂交土种羊十二万九千多只，各地又大量选拔民间良种交配，对改善牲畜的品种、增加羊毛的生产和提高羊毛的质量起了很大的作用。人民银行还发放了大批畜牧贷款，有力地扶助畜牧业的恢复和发展。据一九五二年年底的统计，西北各种牲畜与一九五零年年底比较：绵羊增加百分之二十一点五四，山羊增加百分之三十八点六，役畜增加百分之二十四点二七。若以去年和
    一九三七年比较：绵羊恢复到百分之八十四点零五，山羊超过百分之十六点七三，役畜超过百分之二十六点五二。纯牧区从解放后至去年底，牲畜增加一倍以上。宁夏阿拉善旗的羊由十五万只增加到三十八万八千九百余只，马由三千匹增加到一万零五百七十七匹，骆驼由五万峰增加到六万二千七百多峰。青海去年羊毛的产量比解放前增加了百分之六十。显然，畜牧业是在迅速地恢复与发展着。
    国营贸易网贯彻了为畜牧业服务的方针，认真推行了公平合理与自由贸易的政策，领导着正当私商大量收购皮、毛和土产、特产，供应粮食、布匹、茶、百货，活跃了牧区的物资交流，各族人民生活开始得到改善。宁夏五万多蒙族牧民的阿拉善旗，去年上半年从巴兰浩特贸易公司购回的粮、布、茶、百货等价值一千四百三十二亿多元，甘肃旧城贸易公司供应藏族牧民的粮食，一九五○年是六千斤，一九五一年是二十五万六千斤，去年上半年就增至七十二万斤。甘肃五万多藏族牧民的夏河，一九五一年从拉卜楞贸易公司购回布三万匹。西北区花纱布公司销出的布匹，特别是色布和花布都是在直线上升。
    共产党和人民政府正帮助牧区人民：建立了或筹备建立自治区和自治机关，培养了大批民族干部，调解了民族纠纷，结束了历史上民族仇杀的悲剧，清剿了土匪和反革命分子，开展了文化、卫生工作，掀起了爱国增畜运动。今天的西北牧区已是走上人畜兴旺的道路了。在辽阔的西北草原上，到处流行着一首柯尔克孜族牧民的民歌：太阳照暖了帕米尔高原，毛主席领导着我们，一年好过一年。马儿羊儿呀！成群成队的添；奶子、羊毛呀！永远用不完。浑河的水流不尽，毛主席的恩情说不完。
