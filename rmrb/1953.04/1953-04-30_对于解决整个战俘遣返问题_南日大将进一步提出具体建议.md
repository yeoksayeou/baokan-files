    Regarding the Resolution of the Entire POW Repatriation Issue
    General Nam Il Further Proposes Specific Suggestions

    The Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation of the Korean and Chinese side issued a communique on April 29th:
    The two delegations held a meeting on April 29th. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, suggested at the meeting that the POWs not directly repatriated be sent to a neutral Asian nation agreed upon by both sides, and indicated that the issue of the time limit for handling POWs not directly repatriated was negotiable.
    General Nam Il said:
    "Our side has repeatedly stated that in the negotiations between the two sides, solutions can only be found through consultation and discussion. In fact, our side's specific implementation plan for resolving the entire POW issue is proposed as the basis for discussions between the two sides. Our side believes that only by entering into specific discussions can the two sides gradually reach consensus on the specific implementation plan. Any party taking a dismissive attitude towards the other party's opinions is not conducive to the progress of the meeting.
    Regarding the issue of when to send POWs not directly repatriated to a neutral country and the length of their stay in the neutral country, our side originally advocated sending them to the neutral country within one month after the completion of direct repatriation, and having the relevant party explain to them within six months after they arrive in the neutral country. However, since your side feels that this takes too long, we believe that while an appropriate time is absolutely necessary, the specific time limit is negotiable. We are willing to hear your side's opinions on this.
    As for the nomination of neutral countries, in order to place the POWs not directly repatriated under its custody, our side is prepared to nominate a neutral Asian country for consultation with your side. Once the principle of sending POWs not directly repatriated to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides is established, our side will immediately prepare to enter into specific discussions on this issue, and I am willing to listen to your side's opinions."
    The other side still insisted on the three points of opinion it put forward on April 16 at the meeting, and openly stated that a higher-level political conference may not be able to resolve the issue of POWs not directly repatriated after being looked after by a neutral country for a certain period.
    General Nam Il immediately pointed out: Given the POWs’ fears about their own repatriation, which have accumulated over a long period of time while being detained by one side, it is absolutely necessary to send them to an environment in a neutral country agreed upon by both sides, so that they are completely free from the influence of the detaining party. Only in an environment in a neutral country agreed upon by both sides, after the explanations from the side to which these POWs belong, can their fears be dispelled. Our side firmly believes that this is the most reasonable way to resolve the differences between the two sides on the issue of POW repatriation. As for the nomination of this neutral country, which is agreed upon by both sides to temporarily take in the POWs not directly repatriated within its territory, for practical reasons, including geographical proximity, our side believes that it should be a neutral Asian country. Furthermore, our side pointed out that there is no reason to assume that a higher-level political conference, whose responsibility is to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, would not be able to resolve the issue of POWs not directly repatriated who may still be under the care of the neutral country after six months.
    The two sides are scheduled to continue the delegation plenary meeting at 11:00 a.m. on April 30th.

    对于解决整个战俘遣返问题
    南日大将进一步提出具体建议
    【新华社开城二十九日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十九日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团四月二十九日举行会议。我方首席代表南日大将在会上建议，把未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个双方同意的亚洲中立国家去，并表示关于处理未被直接遣返的战俘的期限问题是可以商量的。
    南日大将说：
    “我方曾多次表示，在双方的谈判中，只有通过协商讨论，才能求得问题的解决。事实上，我方解决整个战俘问题的具体实施方案，是作为双方讨论的基础提出的。我方认为只有进入具体讨论，双方对于具体实施方案的意见，才能逐步取得一致。任何一方对对方的意见采取一笔抹煞的态度，是无助于会议的进展的。
    关于未被直接遣返的战俘何时送到中立国和在中立国停留的时间问题，我方本来主张直接遣返完成后的一月内送到中立国，在到达中立国后的六个月内，由有关一方向他们进行解释。但你方既然觉得这样做时间太长，我们认为适当的时间虽然是完全必需的，但具体的期限却是可以商量的。对此我们愿意听到你方的意见。
    至于中立国的提名问题，为将未被直接遣返的战俘送置于其收容之下，我方准备提名一个亚洲中立国家和你方商量。将未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个双方同意的中立国去成为原则一经确定，我方即将准备进入关于这个问题的具体讨论，我愿意听取你方的意见。”
    对方在会上仍然主张其四月十六日提出的三点意见，并公开说高一级政治会议可能解决不了由中立国看管一定期限后尚未被直接遣返的战俘的问题。
    南日大将当即指出：鉴于战俘们对于他们本身遣返问题的疑惧，是他们在被拘留一方所长期积累起来的，因此把他们送到一个双方同意的中立国的环境之下，使他们完全脱离拘留一方的影响，是完全必要的。只有在一个双方同意的中立国的环境之下，经过这些战俘所属一方的解释，才能解除他们的疑惧。我方肯定认为这是解决双方在战俘遣返问题上的分歧的最合理的办法。至于这个双方同意的暂时在其国土内收管未被直接遣返的战俘的中立国的提名问题，则由于实际上的理由，包括地理上的邻近，我方主张应该是一个亚洲的中立国家。此外，我方指出，没有任何理由可以假定以和平解决朝鲜问题为职责的高一级政治会议，竟不能解决六个月后可能尚在中立国看管下的未被直接遣返的战俘的问题。
    双方定于四月三十日上午十一时继续举行代表团大会。
