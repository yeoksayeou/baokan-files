In order to meet the needs of national economic construction and the people in urban and rural areas, especially the vast number of peasants, Hubei Province held a handicraft industry representatives conference. It thoroughly studied the current situation and problems of the handicraft industry, correctly interpreted the policy of our Party and the People's Government to appropriately support and develop the handicraft industry according to needs and possible conditions, and formulated "Agreement on Several Issues between Masters and Apprentices, Employers and Employees, Labor and Capital" after full discussion by the representatives. The experience of this conference was successful and worthy of promotion throughout the country.

In our national economy, the handicraft industry accounts for a large proportion. The handicrafts produced in urban and rural areas provide a large quantity of people's livelihoods and means of production. About two thousand six hundred handicraft production cooperatives have been organized. Some of these handicrafts have been replaced by modern industry and cannot be maintained, and decline is inevitable; but a large part of them have not been replaced by modern industry and still have value and room for development. These should be protected, and should be appropriately supported and developed according to needs and possible conditions. It is obviously very wrong to underestimate the role of the handicraft industry in our country's economic construction and to fail to provide the necessary and possible maintenance for the existing handicraft economy.

The role of the handicraft economy in our country's new economic construction cannot be ignored. This is because our country has always been an economically backward agricultural country, with the individual small-scale peasant economy dominating. Agricultural production tools are generally manual tools; in this case, handicraft production is absolutely necessary. Although the total output of agricultural production in our country in recent years has exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War, the means of production for farmers, such as agricultural tools and fertilizers, have not exceeded the pre-war level in quantity and quality. In order to further develop agricultural production, we must attach importance to the close connection between the handicraft economy and the small-scale peasant economy.

Many handicraftsmen believe that with the start of the country's new economic construction, people only want large industries and not small industries, let alone handicrafts. Therefore, they pessimistically say that "there is no future in handicrafts." This is completely a misunderstanding. In fact, large industries cannot be built quickly, nor can many be built all at once. Moreover, even if many large industries are built, small industries and many handicrafts are still needed. Many of our cadres also seem to not understand this principle. When they talk about large-scale economic construction, they only pay attention to industry and not agriculture; they only pay attention to large industries and not small industries and handicrafts; they even only pay attention to basic construction and not the production of existing factories. These one-sided views are very wrong. They violate the laws of economic development. In fact, in the initial stage of national economic construction, we must pay attention to the development of small industries and handicrafts while developing large industries. The experience of the Soviet Union proves this.

        The "Instructions on Drafting the Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development" adopted by the 15th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1927 stated:

    "When drafting the Five-Year Plan, attention must be paid to the development of local small industries and handicrafts, because these industries are currently absolutely necessary assistants to the country's large industries, which can help eliminate commodity shortages and reduce unemployment." Small industries and handicrafts played a huge role in the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, especially in its early stages. Our country has only just begun to carry out planned economic construction. If we only pay attention to large industries and not small industries, and do not appropriately support and develop handicrafts according to needs and possible conditions, it will not only cause livelihood problems for the vast number of handicraftsmen and increase the unemployed population in urban and rural areas, but also greatly affect farmers' production and cause commodity shortages in the commercial market, hindering market prosperity. The market situation in various parts of our country in recent years has proved that all handicrafts that supply the daily necessities of production and life for the vast number of people in urban and rural areas have greatly developed, and these handicraft products are in short supply; only those handicraft products that do not meet the needs of the people and are of poor quality have surplus and backlog phenomena.

Therefore, the key issue at present is to implement the policies of our Party and the Central People's Government and strengthen active leadership in handicraft production. We must, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, make the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, like other social economic components, cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each performing its own duties to promote the development of the entire social economy. Of course, because the future of our social and economic development is to move towards socialism, the individual economy of our farmers and handicraftsmen will not encounter the misfortune under the capitalist system, will not be destroyed by capitalist industry and lead to bankruptcy and destruction; we are able to guide them steadily onto the road of socialism, like the Soviet Union today. However, this is a very long-term development process, and we must not take blindly progressive measures. Phenomena such as blindly organizing handicraft joint ventures and cooperatives, confusing the labor-capital relations, employment relations, and master-apprentice relations of handicrafts, and improperly handling them must be prevented and corrected.

Guiding individual handicraftsmen to organize and take the road of cooperatives is the correct direction of development and must be given importance. We must earnestly support those handicraft production cooperatives that have achieved results and summarize their experiences in order to promote them under appropriate conditions. However, according to the current actual situation, the conditions for the widespread development of handicraft production cooperatives are not yet mature, and we should not be too hasty. For the production of the vast number of handicraftsmen, we must make proper adjustments through price policies and through the production and sales relations of the market; at the same time, we must provide correct guidance through necessary and feasible political and economic work. It is absolutely impossible to arbitrarily formulate handicraft production plans based solely on one's own subjective wishes and try to implement them in practice. Currently, the production of various handicrafts can only be roughly explained according to the needs of society, so that handicraftsmen can understand which should be developed, which can only be maintained, and which should be transferred, and each industry should negotiate to find a solution.

All the obstacles and difficulties encountered by handicrafts needed for the national economy and people's livelihood can be overcome. The labor-capital, employment, and master-apprentice relations in handicrafts must be properly handled. The agreement passed by the Hubei Provincial Handicraft Industry Representatives Conference is practical and feasible. Generally speaking, most of the handicraftsmen in our country are small producers; there are not many handicraft capitalists who live by exploiting the labor of others and do not participate in the main labor themselves. Some people hire individual assistants and apprentices and undertake the main technical labor themselves. This is still a small producer and not a capitalist; it is obviously wrong to regard this employment relationship and master-apprentice relationship as a labor-capital relationship. All handicraft owners and employees and apprentices should improve their relationship and eliminate concerns under the goal of unity and production. Secondly, some issues in the relationship between public and private sectors must also be reasonably resolved. Financial departments, commercial departments, banks, and cooperatives at all levels should provide necessary assistance to handicrafts beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood in terms of taxation, loans, processing orders, and raw material procurement. For the taxation of handicrafts, we should adopt the method of regular fixed-amount collection as much as possible; bank loans should take care of the needs of handicraftsmen, simplify procedures, and extend the time; supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should focus on establishing close ties with handicraftsmen and sign supply and marketing contracts to reduce the difficulties for handicraftsmen in purchasing raw materials and selling finished products.

With the correct support in all aspects, the vast number of handicraftsmen should greatly increase their confidence and strive to produce and sell their own products. They should not rely on processing orders from commercial departments, nor should they only rely on the assistance of cooperatives. The original procurement and sales system of handicrafts should not be destroyed, but should continue to play a certain role. As long as handicraftsmen can work together to improve production technology, improve product quality, improve management methods, and actively produce and sell their own products, then under the leadership of the country's correct policies, the handicraft economy will definitely be able to make more contributions to our country's future economic construction undertakings.

### 必须重视手工业

    必须重视手工业
    为了适应国家的经济建设和城乡人民特别是广大农民的需要，湖北省召开了一次手工业代表会议，详细地研究了目前手工业的情况和问题，正确地解释了我们的党和人民政府根据需要和可能的条件适当地扶植和发展手工业的方针，并在代表们充分讨论之后制订了“关于师徒、雇佣、劳资之间几项问题的协议”。这个会议的经验是成功的，值得全国各地加以推广。
    在我国国民经济中，手工业占着很大的比重。各地城乡的手工业所生产的人民生活资料和生产资料有很大的数量。已经组织起来的手工业生产合作社约有二千六百个。这些手工业有一部分已经被现代工业所代替，无法维持下去，衰落是不可避免的；但还有很大一部分并没有被现代工业所代替，仍然有存在的价值和发展的余地。这就应当加以保护，就应当根据需要和可能的条件，适当地加以扶植和发展。轻视手工业在我们国家经济建设中的作用。对于现有的手工业经济不予以必要的和可能的维持，显然是十分错误的。
    手工业经济在我们国家的新经济建设中的作用是不容忽视的。这是因为我们的国家一向是经济落后的农业国，个体的小农经济占绝对的优势，农业生产工具一般的都是手工工具；在这种情况下，手工业生产就是绝对必需的。近年来我国农业生产的总产量虽然超过了抗日战争以前的水平，但是农民的生产资料如农具、肥料等，在数量和质量上并没有超过战前的水平。为了进一步发展农业生产，我们就必须重视手工业经济对于小农经济的密切联系。
    有许多手工业者以为国家的新经济建设开始了，人们就只要大工业，而不要小工业，更不要手工业，因此，悲观失望地说“手工业没有搞头”了。这完全是一种误解。其实，大工业不是很快都能够建设起来的，也不是一下子能够建设得很多的。而且，即便许多大工业建设起来了，小工业和许多手工业也仍然是需要的。我们有许多干部似乎也不懂得这个道理。他们一谈到大规模的经济建设，就只注意工业，而不注意农业；只注意大工业，而不注意小工业和手工业；甚至于只注意基本建设，而不注意现有工厂的生产。这些片面的观点是很不对的。是违背经济发展的规律的。事实上，在国家经济建设的初期，和发展大工业同时，我们还必须注意发展小工业和手工业。苏联的经验证明了这一点。
        一九二七年苏联共产党第十五次代表大会所通过的“关于拟定国民经济五年计划的指示”中说：
    “在拟定五年计划时，必须注意发展地方性的小工业、手工业，因为这些工业在目前乃是国家大工业所完全必需的助手，它能帮助消灭商品不足与减轻失业现象。”小工业和手工业在苏联社会主义建设中特别是它的早期发生了巨大的作用。我国现时才开始进行有计划的经济建设，如果只注意大工业，而不注意小工业，不根据需要和可能的条件适当地扶植和发展手工业，就不但将引起广大手工业者的生活问题，增加城市和乡村的失业人口，而且会在很大程度上影响农民的生产，并将引起商业市场上发生商品不足的现象，妨害市场的繁荣。我国各地近年来的市场情况已经证明：凡是供应城乡广大人民生产和生活必需品的手工业，都有了很大的发展，这些手工业产品是供不应求的；只有那些不合人民需要的和粗制滥造的手工业产品，才有过剩和积压的现象。
    因此，目前的关键问题就是要贯彻执行我们的党和中央人民政府的政策，加强对手工业生产的积极领导。我们必须按照共同纲领的规定，使农民和手工业者的个体经济和其他各种社会经济成份一样，都在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。当然，由于我们社会经济发展的前途是走向社会主义的，所以我国农民和手工业者的个体经济，不会遭遇到在资本主义制度下的那种厄运，不会受资本主义工业的摧残而致破产和毁灭；我们是能够引导他们稳步地走上社会主义，像今天苏联一样的道路的。但是，这是一个很长时期的发展过程，决不能采取盲目冒进的办法。那种盲目地组织手工业联营和合作社，对于手工业的劳资关系、雇佣关系、师徒关系等混淆不清，以致处理失当的现象，必须加以防止和纠正。
    引导个体生产的手工业者组织起来，走合作社的道路，这是正确的发展方向，必须加以重视。必须认真支持那些已经得到成绩的手工业生产合作社，并总结它们的经验，以便在适当的条件下加以推广。但是，根据目前的实际情况，手工业生产合作社普遍发展的条件还不成熟，不应该操之过急。对于广大手工业者的生产，必须通过价格政策，通过市场的产销关系，加以正当的调节；同时，通过必要的可行的政治工作和经济工作，加以正确的指导。单凭自己的主观愿望任意地制定手工业的生产计划，要在实际中去执行，这是绝对行不通的。各种手工业的生产，目前还只能根据社会需要的情况，大体上加以说明，使手工业者自己能够明了那些应该发展，那些只能维持，那些应该转业，由各行业自己协商，求得解决。
    凡是为国计民生所需要的手工业，在目前所遇到的一些障碍和困难，是完全可以克服的。对于手工业中的劳资、雇佣和师徒关系，必须加以妥善的处理。湖北省手工业代表会议所通过的协议是切实可行的。一般地说，我国手工业者，绝大部分是小生产者；依靠剥削别人的劳动为生、自己不参加主要劳动的手工业资本家是不多的。有的人雇佣个别助手和学徒，自己担负主要的技术劳动，这仍然是小生产者而不是资本家；如果把这种雇佣关系和师徒关系当成了劳资关系，显然是错误的。所有手工业主和雇工、学徒都应该在团结生产的目标下改善关系，消除顾虑。其次，在公私关系上有些问题也必须合理地加以解决。各级财政部门、商业部门、银行和合作社，应该从税收、贷款、加工定货和原料采购等方面，给予有利于国计民生的手工业以必要的扶助。对于手工业的税收，应多采取定期定额征收的方法；银行贷款应照顾手工业者的需要，简化手续，加长时间；各地供销合作社，应当着重地建立与手工业者的密切联系，订立供销合同，以减少手工业者采购原料和推销成品的困难。
    在各方面正确的扶植之下，广大的手工业者应该大大地提高信心，努力自产自销，不应该依赖商业部门的加工定货，不应该只靠合作社的帮助。对于手工业原有的采购和销售的系统，不可加以破坏，而要使它继续发生一定的作用。只要手工业者能够共同努力提高生产技术，改进产品质量，改善经营方法，积极自产自销，那末在国家的正确政策的领导之下，手工业经济就一定能够在我国今后的经济建设事业中有更多的贡献。
