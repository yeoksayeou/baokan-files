Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Eisenhower, immediately after taking office, clamorously touted aggressive and expansionist policies, but now even the American monopoly bourgeois newspapers, which once praised Eisenhower to the skies, are beginning to admit that Eisenhower is ambitious but lacks talent and cannot achieve anything.

A United Nations dispatch published in the Sunday supplement of "The New York Times" on March 15, one of the main mouthpieces of the American monopoly bourgeoisie, is a representative example of such remarks.

"The New York Times" first talked about the U.S. policy in Europe, saying: "The new government in Washington will make very few changes in its basic policies toward Western Europe." The newspaper believes that the so-called policy of forceful "liberation," which Eisenhower had been trumpeting since the election, has been "pushed into the background" because of "the concerns felt by our Western European allies and the internal debates within the (Republican) Party in Congress." And the "threat to cut aid to Europe," which the United States has consistently used to pressure Western European countries to follow its war policies, has now also failed. The newspaper pointed out that "Western European diplomats" have seen through this American intimidation and now "believe that the U.S. government does not intend to carry out its previously made threat to cut aid to Europe if the European Army plan collapses and if the possibility of Germany's immediate rearmament also collapses." As a result, "The New York Times" said, Eisenhower, in addition to continuing Truman's old set of so-called "containment policy," "will hardly find any other way."

As for the rest of the world, "The New York Times" dispatch said: "The situation is even less clear." According to this reporter, although Eisenhower has not given up on the plan for new military adventures in Korea, he will avoid "those international entanglements that some of the steps previously discussed would have created." These "international entanglements" had forced Eisenhower to quickly issue statements to revise his call for expanding the Korean War after he had issued it.

"The New York Times" believes that the "only important change" that can now be expected from Eisenhower in this regard is "greater use of South Korean troops and the resumption of military activities against the Chinese mainland by the Nationalist troops"; and "increased use of Vietnamese and Malayan troops." According to this dispatch, the Eisenhower government "very much wants to extend this principle to other parts of Asia," including "parts of the mainland," in order to establish an "Asian army" that "will produce better results." But it admits that this will require not only billions of dollars but also "sufficient diplomatic preparation" and a "certain solution to the Korean War." But this "solution" is precisely what Eisenhower is seeking but cannot obtain. In this way, "The New York Times" vividly depicts the bankruptcy of Eisenhower's aggressive conspiracy.

The "New York Times" reporter then talked about Eisenhower's policy toward China, saying that neither Dulles's statement nor Eisenhower's so-called "order" regarding Taiwan contained anything new, but rather "continued Truman's policy," which is to cling to the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and be hostile to the Chinese people. Regarding the fate of this policy, the reporter gave a side answer: "Not only Asian countries, but even our Western European allies are convinced that no matter how much aid the United States provides, the Nationalist government will not regain control of the mainland in our time."

After making such a comprehensive analysis, the reporter believes that the only hope lies in so-called "liberationism," which is to step up espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

### 美国垄断资产阶级报纸“纽约时报”承认  艾森豪威尔叫嚣的侵略和扩张政策到处碰壁

    美国垄断资产阶级报纸“纽约时报”承认
    艾森豪威尔叫嚣的侵略和扩张政策到处碰壁
    【新华社二十七日讯】艾森豪威尔刚一上台，曾经锣鼓齐鸣地叫嚣侵略和扩张政策，但是现在连曾经对艾森豪威尔大捧特捧的美国垄断资产阶级报纸也开始承认，艾森豪威尔志大才疏，不能有所作为。
    美国垄断资产阶级的主要言论机关之一的“纽约时报”三月十五日星期增刊所载的一则联合国通讯，就是这种具有代表性的言论。
    “纽约时报”首先谈到美国的欧洲政策说：“华盛顿新政府对西欧的基本政策，将很少有所改变。”该报认为，艾森豪威尔自从竞选以来就大事吹嘘的所谓武力“解放”政策，已经因为“我们（美国）的西欧盟国所感到的忧虑，以及（共和）党内部在国会内所进行的争论”而被“推到幕后去了”。而美国一贯用来压迫西欧国家追随美国战争政策的“削减对欧援助的威胁”，现在也失灵了。该报指出，“西欧的外交家”已经看穿了美国的这种恫吓，他们现在“认为，如果欧洲军计划垮台，如果德国立即重整军备的可能性也随之垮台，美国政府并不打算把它以前提出的削减对欧援助的威胁做到底”。结果，“纽约时报”说，艾森豪威尔除了继续杜鲁门的老一套所谓“遏制政策”之外，“很难找出任何其他的办法”。
    至于在世界的其他方面，“纽约时报”的通讯说：“局势就更不清楚了。”照这位记者的意见，尽管艾森豪威尔对于在朝鲜进行新的军事冒险的计划还没有死心，但将避免“以前所讨论过的某些步骤所会造成的那些国际纠葛”。这些“国际纠葛”曾迫使艾森豪威尔在发出扩大朝鲜战争的叫嚣后又赶紧声明修正。
    “纽约时报”认为，这方面现在可能期望于艾森豪威尔的“唯一重要改变”，不过是“更多地使用南朝鲜军队，以及恢复国民党军队对中国大陆进行的军事活动”；再就是“增加使用越南和马来亚的军队”。据这篇通讯说，艾森豪威尔政府“很想把这个原则扩展到亚洲的其他地区”包括“部分的大陆”，以建立“会产生更好效果”的“亚洲军”。但是它承认，这除了需要以亿万美元计的费用，还得有“外交方面的充分准备”，并且还得定出“朝鲜战争的某种解决办法”。但这种“解决办法”正是艾森豪威尔求之而不得的。这样，“纽约时报”就生动地描绘了艾森豪威尔侵略阴谋的破产。
    “纽约时报”的记者接着谈到艾森豪威尔的对华政策，他说，无论是杜勒斯的声明或是艾森豪威尔的关于台湾的所谓“命令”，都并无什么新鲜内容，不过是“继续执行杜鲁门的政策”，这就是死抱住蒋介石残匪、和中国人民为敌的政策。关于这种政策的命运，这位记者作了一个侧面的回答：“不只是亚洲国家，就连我们的西欧盟国也都已深信，不管美国提供多少援助，国民党政府在我们这个时代已不会再度获得对大陆的控制了。”
    在作了这样通盘的分析之后，这位记者认为还只有把希望寄托在所谓“解放主义”上，这就是加紧对苏联和人民民主国家进行间谍破坏活动。
