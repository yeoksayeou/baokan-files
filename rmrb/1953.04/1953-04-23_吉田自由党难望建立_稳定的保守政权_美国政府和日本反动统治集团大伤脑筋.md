Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: News from the United States and Japan generally acknowledges that the results of the Japanese Diet's House of Representatives election represent a defeat for the reactionary forces that support rearmament. The US government and the Japanese ruling clique are deeply troubled by the issue of establishing a "stable conservative regime."

United Press commented on the Japanese election on the 19th, saying: "Prime Minister Yoshida failed in his struggle to regain control of the Japanese Diet." "The unexpectedly small number of seats obtained by Hatoyama's Liberal Party and Shigemitsu's Progressive Party is due to the widespread opposition to rearmament among voters." United Press also said: "The general trend of this vote is that many people who would have voted for conservative parties voted for left-wing parties. Many so-called 'big name' candidates failed in this election." These include Yoshida Liberal Party advisor Etsujiro Uehara, former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Hatoyama's main assistant Hirokawa Hirozen, and Progressive Party Secretary-General Kiyose Ichiro. "Another notable development in the election is that most of the old political figures who attempted to make a comeback after being purged failed."

Japanese political figures acknowledge that the Yoshida Liberal Party was only able to obtain 199 seats not because of genuine support from voters, but because: it adopted deceptive means in the election on the issue of rearmament to cater to the people's opposition to rearmament; used its position as the ruling party to obtain the support of monopoly capital; used the despicable method of suddenly dissolving the Diet to prevent the opposition parties from having enough time to conduct effective campaigns; and also had the support of the United States. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" admitted: "If we observe whether the people trust the Yoshida Cabinet from the situation of this election... then we must say that they have clearly expressed a negative attitude."

The failure of the Yoshida Liberal Party has caused anxiety in the US government. According to a Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Washington, Washington officials originally hoped that the statement by the State Department spokesman on the eve of the Japanese election regarding the US economic "aid" to Japan even after the cessation of the Korean War "could make the election situation favorable to the ruling party," and they were "disappointed that the Yoshida Liberal Party only obtained 199 seats." The weakening of the Japanese ruling clique's forces and the situation where no single party holds a majority in the Diet make "the United States very eager for the conservatives to quickly seek political stability" in order to intensify Japan's rearmament. Japan's Zaibatsu groups are also urging the merger of the various reactionary parties in Japan. Associated Press revealed that the leaders of the Yoshida Liberal Party "are busy trying to get other conservative parties to support Yoshida as prime minister." The day after the election results were announced, Yoshida had already brought two independent elected officials into his party. However, due to the sharp contradictions within the Japanese reactionary group, Kyodo News acknowledged that "the political situation after the election will inevitably be chaotic" and "will continue to be extremely unstable." US officials in Washington also pessimistically believe that "it will be difficult to deal with the Japanese issue in the future as easily as in the past."

### 吉田自由党难望建立“稳定的保守政权”  美国政府和日本反动统治集团大伤脑筋

    吉田自由党难望建立“稳定的保守政权”
    美国政府和日本反动统治集团大伤脑筋
    【新华社二十二日讯】来自美国和日本方面的消息普遍承认日本国会众议员选举的结果是拥护重整军备的反动势力的失败。美国政府和日本统治集团对于建立“稳定的保守政权”问题，正在大伤脑筋。
    合众社评论日本十九日的选举说：“吉田首相在重新控制日本国会的斗争中失败了”。“鸠山的自由党和重光葵的改进党得到的席位之所以出人意外的少，是因为选民普遍反对重新武装。”合众社又说：“这次投票总的趋势是不少的人把投保守党派的票投给了左派的党派。这次选举中所谓‘大名鼎鼎’的候选人有许多失败了。”这些人包括吉田自由党顾问植原悦二郎，前农林相、鸠山的主要助手广川弘禅和改进党干事长清濑一郎等。“在选举中还有另外一个显著的发展，就是在被解除了整肃后企图卷土重来的旧日政界人物大部分是失败了。”
    日本政界人士承认，吉田自由党所以还能得到一百九十九席，并非由于选民的真正支持，而是因为：它在竞选中在重整军备的问题上采取了欺骗手段以迎合人民反对重整军备的心理；利用它的执政党的地位取得垄断资本的支持；以突然解散国会的卑鄙方法使反对党没有充分时间进行有效的竞选；此外还有美国的支持。日本资产阶级的报纸“读卖新闻”承认：“如果从这次选举的情况来观察国民是否信任吉田内阁的话……那就不能不说他们很明确地表明了否定的态度。”
    吉田自由党的失败引起了美国政府的不安。据共同社驻华盛顿特派记者报道：华盛顿官方人士原希望国务院发言人在日本选举前夕发表的关于美国即使在朝鲜战争停止以后仍将给日本的经济“援助”的声明“可以使选举形势对执政党有利”，他们对“吉田自由党只得到一百九十九席感到失望”。日本统治集团势力的削弱和没有一个单独的政党在国会占多数的局面，使“美国很希望保守派迅速求得政治局势的稳定”，以便加紧日本的重新武装。日本的财阀集团也正在督促日本各反动政党合流。美联社透露：吉田自由党的领导人物“正在忙于设法使其他保守党派支持吉田为首相”。在选举揭晓后的第二天，吉田已首先把两个无党派的当选人士拉进了他的党内。但是，由于日本反动集团内部尖锐的矛盾，共同社承认：“选举后的政治形势不免混乱”，并“将继续极度不稳定的形势”。华盛顿的美国官方人士也悲观地认为，“今后处理日本问题时，将难望像过去那样简而易行了”。
