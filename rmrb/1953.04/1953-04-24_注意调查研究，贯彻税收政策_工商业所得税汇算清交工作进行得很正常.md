Pay Attention to Investigation and Research, Implement Tax Policies
The Work of Final Settlement of Industrial and Commercial Income Tax is Proceeding Normally

    The work of final settlement of industrial and commercial income tax for 1952 began in January this year. Tax bureaus of people's governments at all levels across the country started by guiding local industrial and commercial businesses to inventory their stock and prepare inventory lists. They also conducted key in-depth investigations and research into the business profit situation of industrial and commercial businesses last year, basically implementing the spirit of "handling matters according to law, more investigation, more consultation, no over-collection and no under-collection." As a result, the final settlement of income tax is proceeding very normally. As of the end of March this year, industrial and commercial income tax in the special districts, counties, and towns of all provinces across the country has been collected and deposited into the treasury. It is estimated that the industrial and commercial income tax of some municipalities directly under the province and several municipalities directly under the central government can also be fully deposited into the treasury by the end of April.
    In the work of collecting industrial and commercial income tax, most cities have established guidance and declaration organizations including tax cadres, employee shop assistants, and industrial and commercial representatives; the guidance and declaration groups initially review the various statements and reports submitted by industrial and commercial businesses to the tax authorities regarding income and profits and losses. Through guidance and declaration, many false declarations made by industrial and commercial businesses in the calculation of inventory prices, amortization of depreciation, and listing of expenses have been corrected, promoting the normal progress of the declaration work.
    When collecting income tax from households subject to democratic appraisal in various places, the work of selecting typical households and classifying grade types was done more meticulously than in previous years. When selecting typical households, local tax bureaus divided them into types and grades based on the self-reported materials of various industries, and then determined them through consultation with industrial and commercial representatives. This year, most places adopted the method of "researching with employees step by step, consulting with industrial and commercial businesses step by step, convening industry-wide meetings, and announcing the results of account investigations" when selecting typical households. Industrial and commercial businesses in various places generally believe that this year's "selection is accurate, the investigation is stable, and it is truly representative."
    This year, many cities, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Qingdao, and Wuxi, have focused on piloting the collection methods of standard gross profit margin and flexible net profit rate (also called amplitude net profit rate). This method improves the democratic appraisal work and further achieves fairness and rationality. Using the gross profit margin is better than using the net profit rate: because the purchase and sales prices of the same industry are similar, the gross profit margin (that is, the interest rate without deducting all expenses) is roughly the same, but because the expenses of each household are different, the net profit rate is different, so using the standard gross profit margin in the same industry is more fair and reasonable than using the standard net profit rate. Tianjin selected ten key industries, such as new drugs, paper, and vegetable oil, to pilot the standard gross profit margin in the democratic appraisal, basically implementing the principle of "resolutely collecting all that should be collected, and resolutely not collecting what should not be collected." Some areas have adopted a flexible net profit rate. This flexible net profit rate is determined by the tax authorities and industrial and commercial representatives jointly investigating the net profit rate materials of several typical industrial and commercial households, and after consultation, cutting off the excessively high and low net profit rates, and setting the ones that can represent the majority as the flexible net profit rate. Individual households with particularly high or low profits are handled separately. This approach is in line with the actual situation of industrial and commercial businesses in various places.
    In the collection of income tax in various places, most industrial and commercial businesses have taken a serious and responsible attitude and actively paid taxes to the state; however, some industrial and commercial businesses have a very dishonest attitude towards paying taxes, and they肆意exaggerate their difficulties, shouting that they have no profits, and attempt to pay less tax or not pay tax at all. The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau inspected 100 industrial and commercial businesses that declared losses, and 25 of them had surpluses. Among the industrial and commercial households in seven regions of Zhejiang Province that reported losses, after preliminary review, 73 percent of them had surpluses. The results of the inspection in Datong City, Shanxi Province, showed that tax evasion accounted for about 30 percent of the number of households inspected. These industrial and commercial businesses evaded taxes by lowering inventory during the year-end inventory, increasing expenses, increasing the price of initial inventory, lowering the price of ending inventory, and withdrawing capital for interest. Some industrial and commercial businesses also adopted the method of paying salaries according to the proportion of business volume, and implementing disguised advance dividends. These are all acts that violate national tax laws and economic policies. Tax authorities in various places should, under the guidance of the local financial and economic committees, and with the assistance of the industrial and commercial administration departments, employee unions, and federations of industry and commerce, conduct inspections and corrections.
    For some industrial and commercial businesses in various places that used excessively high net profit rates during the estimated collection in the first half of last year, the tax authorities should refund the tax in the spirit of seeking truth from facts. However, it must be done after checking the accounts and solving them household by household according to the actual situation (small households also need to be reviewed and verified), and tax refunds cannot be made according to the proportion of the entire industry; in order not to affect the general collection work, the tax refund work can be carried out after the industrial and commercial income tax work is completed.

### 注意调查研究，贯彻税收政策  工商业所得税汇算清交工作进行得很正常

    注意调查研究，贯彻税收政策
    工商业所得税汇算清交工作进行得很正常
    一九五二年度工商业所得税的汇算清交工作，从今年一月间开始展开。全国各地人民政府税务局从指导当地工商业户盘点存货入手，编好存货清册；并对去年各地工商户的营业利润情况作了重点深入的调查研究，基本上贯彻了“依法办事，多调查，多协商，不多征不少征”的精神，因而所得税的汇算清交工作进行得很正常。截至今年三月底，全国各省的专区、县、镇的工商业所得税已征收入库，部分省辖市及几个中央直辖市的工商业所得税，估计到四月底亦可全部入库。
    在征收工商业所得税的工作中，大多数城市都成立了包括税务工作干部、职工店员、工商代表的辅导申报组织；由辅导申报小组初步审查工商户向税务机关申报所得与损益的各种表报。通过辅导申报，纠正了不少工商户在计算存货价格、摊提折旧、列支费用上的许多虚报情况，推动了申报工作的正常进行。
    各地在征收民主评议户的所得税时，选择典型户和划分等级类型的工作，作得较往年更为细致。在选择典型户时，各地税务局根据各行业的自报材料，分出类型、等级，然后经过与工商业代表协商确定。今年各地选择典型户时大都采取了“步步与职工研究，步步与工商业户协商，召开各业户大会，宣布查账户的结果”的办法，各地工商业户一般认为今年“选的准、查的稳、确有代表性”。
    今年许多城市，如上海、天津、北京、武汉、青岛、无锡等市，重点试用了标准毛利率和弹性纯益率的征收办法（亦叫幅度纯益率）。这种办法改进了民主评议工作，进一步做到了公平合理。采用毛利率比较采用纯益率有好处：因为同行业的进货、销货价格都差不多，毛利率（即是没有除掉一切费用开支的利率）大致相同，但是由于各户的开支情况不同，纯益率就不相同，所以采用同业中的标准毛利率比采用标准纯益率更加公平合理。天津市在民主评议中选择了新药、纸张、植物油等十个重点行业试用了标准毛利率，基本上贯彻了“应收的坚决收齐，不应收的坚决不收”的原则。有些地区采用了弹性纯益率。这种弹性纯益率是由税务机关与工商业代表共同调查若干工商业典型户的纯益率材料，经过协商，把其中过高过低的纯益率截头去尾，就其中能代表大多数的定为弹性纯益率。对个别特殊利厚或利薄的户作单独处理。这种做法，是符合各地工商业户的实际情况的。
    各地在征收所得税中，大多数工商业户都采取了认真负责的态度，积极向国家纳税；但是也有部分工商业户的纳税态度很不老实，他们肆意夸大困难，叫喊无利；企图少纳税或根本不纳税。北京市税务局检查了一百户申报亏损的工商业户，其中有二十五户是有盈余的。浙江省七个地区自报亏损的工商户中，经初步审查后，其中有百分之七十三是有盈余的。山西省大同市检查的结果表明：偷漏税的约占被检查户数的百分之三十左右。这些工商户以年终盘货时降低盘存、扩大开支、提高期初存货价格、降低期末存货价格、抽资吃息等方式偷漏税款。有些工商业户还采用了以营业额大小比例支薪，实行变相的提前分红的办法。这些都是违反国家税收法令和经济政策的行为。各地税务机关应在当地财政经济委员会的指导下，并取得工商行政管理部门、店员工会和工商业联合会的协助，予以检查纠正。
    各地有些工商业户在去年上半年估征时因使用纯益率偏高，税务机关应本实事求是的精神退税。但必须经过查账，按实际情况逐户解决（小户亦需审查核定），不能按整个行业比例退税；为了不影响一般征收工作进行，可把退税工作留在工商业所得税工作完成后再进行。
