    Liaoxi Province is vigorously carrying out drought prevention and moisture conservation work in conjunction with promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. Liaoxi Province is currently quite arid, with rivers and springs already drying up in some areas; water wells have dried up in several areas; in some areas, such as Beizhen County, moist soil is only found six or seven inches below the surface during spring plowing.

    In light of the above situation, the agricultural leadership departments of Liaoxi Province, in order to achieve this year's large-scale high-yield plan, have attached particular importance to mobilizing the masses to carry out drought prevention and moisture conservation work. The slogan put forward by the province in promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience is: "Prevent drought and conserve moisture, appropriately increase planting density, thin seedlings and protect seedlings, and apply fertilizer rationally." "Drought prevention and moisture conservation" is regarded as a prerequisite for promoting new cultivation methods and striving for large-scale high yields. The province's agricultural leadership departments first organized twenty-eight cadres on February 6 to assist in surveying water sources in thirteen key counties, including Liaozhong. On February 21, more than forty cadres were organized to go to various counties to publicize the significance of drought prevention and mobilize the masses to find water sources. So far, through mass searches and government-assisted surveys, many usable water sources have been discovered in various places. For example, after a comprehensive survey in Liaozhong County, 137 usable water sources were discovered, and the stored water can irrigate 1,000 hectares of dry land. There is a river that never dries up year-round beside Huangxi Village in the county, but farmers had never used it to irrigate their land in the past. This year, after surveying and calculating, each household can irrigate by contributing seven workdays to harness the river.

    In carrying out this work, Liaoxi Province has paid particular attention to using typical examples to promote general work methods. For example, the province's working cadres discovered that Liang Hongxiang's mutual aid team in Litun Village, Beizhen County, used spring water for irrigation last year, resulting in an average yield of 440 jin of ginned cotton per mu on eighteen mu of very barren hillside land. They used this example to educate the nearby farmers, making everyone pay attention to using spring water for irrigation. According to surveys, due to the emphasis on these small water sources, the four counties of Jinxi, Suizhong, Beizhen, and Yixian alone found water sources capable of irrigating 9,000 hectares of land in half a month.

    The province also paid attention to assisting the masses in preparing water-lifting tools and imparting water diversion techniques. Liaoxi Province has now lent out more than 2,600 waterwheels and 63 water pumps.

    辽西省发动群众寻找水源防旱保墒
    辽西省正结合推广肇源丰产经验，大力开展防旱保墒工作。辽西省目前相当干旱，部分地区的河流和泉水已经断流；若干地区的水井已经干枯了；有的地区，如北镇县，在春翻地的时候，挖下六、七寸才有湿土。
    根据以上情况，辽西省的农业领导部门为了争取今年大面积丰产计划的实现，就特别重视了发动群众，进行防旱保墒的工作。该省在推广肇源丰产经验中提出的口号是：防旱保墒、适度密植、间苗保苗、合理施肥。把“防旱保墒”作为推广新耕作法，争取大面积丰收的先决条件。该省农业领导部门首先在二月六日组织了二十八个干部，分别到辽中等十三个重点县协助勘测水源，又在二月二十一日组织了四十多个干部到各县宣传防旱的意义和发动群众寻找水源。到目前为止，经过群众寻找和政府协助勘查，各地都发现了许多可以利用的水源。如辽中县经过全面勘测，发现可利用的水源一百三十七处，所蓄的水可浇一千垧旱田。该县黄西村村边有条常年不干的河，过去农民从没有利用它浇过地。今年经过勘测计算，全村平均每户出七个工治河，就可以引水灌溉。
    辽西省在开展这一工作中，特别注意了运用典型推动一般的工作方法。例如，该省工作干部发现了北镇县李屯村梁洪祥互助组去年利用泉水灌溉，使十八亩十分贫瘠山坡地，每亩平均收获四百四十斤籽棉的事例，就利用这一事例向附近农民进行宣传教育，使大家都重视了利用泉水来进行灌溉。据调查，由于重视了这些细小的水源，仅锦西、绥中、北镇和义县四个县，在半个月内就找到了能浇九千垧地的水源。
    该省同时注意了协助群众准备提水工具和传授引水技术等工作。辽西全省现已贷放水车二千六百多架、抽水机六十三台。
