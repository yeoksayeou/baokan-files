    The General Political Department Cultural Troupe of the Military Commission Performs慰问演出 in Anshan

    The Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission gave慰问演出 performances in Anshan for thirteen days, from March 17th to 29th, with programs including songs, dances, and acrobatics. The audience reached over 150,000 people. This was the largest, longest, and most attended performance since the liberation of Anshan. The workers of Anshan City were greatly encouraged. Many workers wrote to the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper, expressing their intention to thank the Central People's Government for sending the cultural troupe to express its concern by completing or overfulfilling the production plan for the first quarter. Before and after the performances, grand ceremonies were held, and Chen Yi, Minister of Culture of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and Fang Zhiping, Mayor of Anshan City, both gave speeches.

    Ancient Artifacts and Revolutionary Relics from the Red Army's Long March Discovered in Lixian County, Sichuan

    Staff members of the Southwest Museum, in coordination with the construction of highways in Lixian County, Sichuan Province, excavated many ancient artifacts. More than 50 pieces of Neolithic stone tools were discovered in Jiashan Rock and Mengdonggou in Lixian County. 彩陶片 were found in the ancient city Ping (also known as Jiang Wei City) in Xianzhou. Although the patterns on these 彩陶片are slightly different from those in Gansu, they are roughly the same type of thing. These discoveries are of great value for studying the primitive social history of the Qiang and Tibetan ethnic minorities who live there. In the above areas, a variety of Han Dynasty bronzes, ironware, coins, and pottery were also discovered. Some belonged to the Qiang and Tibetan ethnic groups, and some belonged to the Han people; the era belongs to between the early Western Han Dynasty and the late Eastern Han Dynasty. From these cultural relics, it can be seen that the local culture had reached a very high level more than 2,000 years ago, and the situation of contact between various ethnic groups at that time can be seen. The above areas were once passed through by the Red Army during the Long March, and there are many revolutionary relics left by the Red Army. The Southwest Museum has collected some, including Red Army proclamations, slogans, and stone carvings. All of these are now stored in the Southwest Museum.

    四川理县一带发现古代文物及红军长征时的革命文物
    西南博物院工作人员在四川省理县一带配合公路的修建工程，发掘到很多古代文物。在理县的佳山岩及孟董沟等地发现了新石器时代的石器五十多件。在咸州的古城坪（又称姜维城）发现了彩陶片，这些彩陶片的花纹和甘肃的彩陶虽略有不同，但大致是同类的东西。这些发现，对研究聚居该地的少数民族——羌族与藏族的原始社会历史，有很大价值。在上述地区，还发现了汉代的铜器、铁器、钱币及陶器多种。有些是属于羌族与藏族的，有的是属于汉族的；时代属于西汉初年到东汉末年之间。从这些文物中，可以看出二千多年前当地的文化已达到很高的水平，并可以看出当时各民族间接触的情形。上述地区曾经是红军长征时所经过的地方，红军留下的革命文物很多。西南博物院已搜集了一些，有红军的布告、标语、石刻等。现在都存在西南博物院内。
