Xinhua News Agency, March 31st—Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, sent a telegram to the French National Peace Council, expressing deep condolences on the unfortunate passing of Mr. Facci. The text of the telegram is as follows:
To the French National Peace Council:

    I was shocked to learn of the unfortunate passing of Mr. Yves Farge, member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the French National Peace Council. On behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, I extend my deepest condolences to the French National Peace Council and the peace-loving people of France.

    Mr. Yves Farge, a distinguished fighter for the cause of world peace, was a close friend of the Chinese people and the people of the world. He made tremendous contributions to the cause of defending world peace and democracy, and was therefore awarded the lofty honor of the Stalin International Peace Prize. His passing is a great loss to the cause of peace. However, I firmly believe that the peace-loving and just people of the world will continue to strive for the cause of lasting world peace to which he dedicated himself, on the basis of ever-increasing unity and friendship.
                          Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace
