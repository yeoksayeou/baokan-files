The Northeast No. 101 Factory construction project, thanks to the united cooperation between the factory (hereinafter referred to as Party A) and the contracting unit (hereinafter referred to as Party B), completed the project plan on schedule last year, and the project quality basically met the design requirements. This year, the factory's dormitory project will start ahead of schedule due to timely preparations.

The No. 101 Factory is a key construction project that began last year, contracted by the Second Engineering Department of the former Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company. During the construction process, Parties A and B helped and cooperated with each other to overcome difficulties, which played a significant role in ensuring the project's progress and quality. For example, in the initial stage of construction, Party B lacked labor for the excavation project, which would affect the overall project progress. Party A mobilized all employees to assist and overcome the difficulties. Last year, Comrade Gao Gang, Chairman of the former Northeast People's Government, called for completing 80% of the plan by the end of August. Party B, due to not being vigilant enough before, still had a portion of roof tiles not laid. Party A again mobilized employees to help, and as a result, Comrade Gao Gang's call was successfully realized. Similarly, Party B also actively overcame difficulties to strive for completing the project plan on schedule. For example, Party A could not buy elbows for the heating pipes, and work was about to stop. Party B mobilized experienced workers to find a solution, and solved the problem by using the hot bending method under the principle of ensuring quality. However, the relationship between Parties A and B was not very good from the beginning. For example, some employees of Party B initially had some erroneous ideas, believing that "The project is contracted to us, you don't need to worry about it; just completing the task at the end of the year is enough." Therefore, when Party A's inspections were stricter, they expressed dissatisfaction. Even when Party A's inspector was inspecting the steel bars, a worker in the reinforced concrete workshop hit the inspector's hand with a small iron chisel.

Later, the reason why the relationship between the two parties was able to improve so much was first and foremost because the leadership clearly recognized that the goals of both parties were the same, jointly shouldering the glorious task entrusted by the state. At the joint meeting of the two parties at the beginning of this year, the factory director once again stated his attitude, he said to Party B: "Your difficulties are our difficulties. In order to complete the national plan, we will definitely help you. That's how we did it last year, and we will do it even better this year." Secondly, the leaders of both parties paid attention to educating the employees. Last year, Parties A and B frequently raised the issue of "improving the relationship between Parties A and B" for discussion through criticism and commendation meetings, departmental meetings, and year-end summaries, and timely criticized the erroneous understanding of some people who believed that "Party A only needs to send a few people to walk around and take a look at the construction site" and "only supervise but not assist." More importantly, a joint meeting system between Parties A and B was established, with the participation of Party A's factory director, department heads, and Party B's engineering company manager, site director, and other cadres. At the meeting, the two parties solved many problems in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The above-mentioned incident of Party B's worker hitting Party A's inspector was resolved satisfactorily at the joint meeting, the director of the reinforced concrete workshop was punished, and this case was used to educate all employees. At the same time, at this meeting, both parties could raise difficulties and problems and jointly study and make decisions, and either party had to implement them conscientiously. For example, at this year's joint meeting, Party B reported the preparation situation to Party A, and Party A helped Party B solve the problem of temporarily not being able to buy cement and other materials, and based on past experience, put forward opinions on some problems in Party B's construction organization design, especially pointing out that Party B's water storage capacity on the construction site was insufficient and needed to be increased. This made the preparations more adequate and thorough.

Currently, the factory's dormitory project is about to start. Parties A and B have organized another major inspection before the start of construction, mobilizing the employees of both parties, with the professional departments as the main force, to comprehensively inspect the work. In addition to inspecting the preparation of main materials and labor, special attention is paid to solving key problems to ensure the progress and quality after the start of construction.

    东北一零一厂建设工程甲乙双方团结互助克服不少困难
    东北一零一厂建设工程，由于厂方（下称甲方）和承包单位（下称乙方）团结合作，去年按时完成了工程计划，工程质量基本上合乎设计要求。今年该厂的宿舍工程，因及时做好了准备工作，将提前开工。
    一零一厂是去年开始建设的重点工程，由原东北工业部建设工程公司第二工程处承包。在施工中，甲乙双方互助合作克服困难，对保证工程进度和质量起了很大作用。如在施工初期，乙方挖土工程缺乏劳动力，将影响整个工程进度，甲方就动员全体职工协助，克服了困难。去年，原东北人民政府主席高岗同志号召在八月底完成计划百分之八十，乙方由于以前抓得不紧，还差一部分屋瓦未盖好，甲方又动员职工前去帮助，结果胜利地实现了高岗同志的号召。同样，乙方也积极克服困难，争取按期完成工程计划。如甲方买不到暖气管道上的弯头，眼看就要停工；乙方便动员老工人想办法，在保证质量的原则下，用热弯管法解决了问题。但是，甲乙双方的关系不是一开始就搞得很好的。如乙方部分职工在最初还存在着一些错误思想，认为“工程包给我们了，你们就不用管；年底完成任务就得了”。因而在甲方检查得严格一些时，他们就表示不满，甚至当甲方检查员检查钢筋时，钢筋混凝土车间有一个工人就用小铁凿子把检查员的手打伤了。
    后来，双方的关系所以能够搞得很好，首先是由于领导思想上明确地认识到双方的目标是一致的，共同担负着国家交给的光荣任务。在今年年初的双方联席会议上，该厂厂长再度表明态度，他对乙方说：“你们的困难就是我们的困难，为了完成国家计划，我们一定帮助你们，去年是这样做了，今年还要做得更好。”其次是双方领导上注意对职工进行教育。去年甲乙双方曾通过批评与表扬大会、科务会议、年终总结等，将“搞好甲乙双方关系”的问题经常提出讨论，并及时批判了某些人认为“甲方只要派几个人去工地走走看看”与“只监督不协助”的错误认识。更重要的是建立了甲乙双方联席会议的制度，由甲方厂长、各科科长及乙方工程公司经理、工地主任等干部参加。在会上双方以批评与自我批评的精神解决了不少问题，上面所说乙方工人打伤甲方检查员的事件，就是在联席会议上得到了圆满解决的，处分了钢筋混凝土车间主任，并以此事例教育全体职工。同时，在这个会议上，双方都可把困难及问题提出来，共同研究作出决定，任何一方都要切实执行。如在今年的联席会议上，乙方曾把准备工作情况向甲方汇报，甲方就帮助乙方解决了暂时买不到的水泥等材料问题，并根据过去经验，对乙方施工组织设计中的一些问题提出意见，特别指出乙方工地贮水量不够，需要增加。这就使得准备工作更加充分和周到了。
    目前该厂的宿舍工程即将开工，甲乙双方又组织了一次开工大检查，发动双方职工，以专业科为主，全面检查工作，除检查主要材料、劳动力的准备情况外，特别注意解决关键性的问题，以保证开工后的进度和质量。
