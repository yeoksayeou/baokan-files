　　The Mongolian People's Republic Art Troupe and Chinese literary and art workers began to learn from each other and exchange experiences on the 24th. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government organized small-scale seminars for literary and art workers from the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the Affiliated Song and Dance Theater of the Central Academy of Drama, the China Acrobatic Troupe, the Cultural Troupe of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Air Force, and the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, along with the actors of the Mongolian Art Troupe. The seminars were divided into four groups: music, dance, and acrobatics. In music, Chinese music workers mainly learned from the Mongolian Art Troupe about orchestral music, composition, vocal music, and folk music. Chinese dance workers mainly studied the "Durbet Folk Dance," "Mongolian Dance," and "Herdsman's Dance," which demonstrate the artistic characteristics of the Mongolian nation. In acrobatics, Chinese acrobats focused on learning the Mongolian Art Troupe's programs such as "Ladder Topping," "Magic," and "Contortion." Chinese literary and art workers have begun performing acrobatics for the Mongolian Art Troupe and will hold observation performances of Peking Opera, local operas, and other programs. At the various small-scale seminars held on the 24th, Chinese and Mongolian literary and art workers held in-depth discussions, fully exchanged experiences in literary and art work in both countries, and specifically learned the performance arts of various programs from each other.
