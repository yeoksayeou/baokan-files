Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: "Pravda" and "Izvestia" published articles on the 2nd, using many facts and figures to illustrate the plight of working people in various capitalist countries.

    Alkhimov wrote in "Pravda": The cost of living is rising everywhere in the capitalist camp, taxes are increasing, the number of unemployed is growing, and the living standards of the people are constantly declining. From the end of 1947 to 1952, the price of bread in the United States rose by 28 percent, in the United Kingdom by 90 percent, and in France by more than 100 percent; during the same period, the price of meat in the United States rose by 26 percent, in the United Kingdom by 35 percent, and in France by 88 percent.

    Despite the continuous rise in prices, capitalists are trying their best to keep workers' wages at extremely low levels. As a result, working people in capitalist countries have to reduce their already meager consumption. From 1949 to 1951, meat consumption in France decreased by 24 percent. In the United Kingdom, the average per capita consumption of meat and butter in 1951 was 40 percent lower than before the war.

    Osipov commented in "Izvestia" on the impact of the ruling groups' aggressive policies in capitalist countries on people's lives. He wrote: The continuous increase in military spending has increased the tax burden on people, which is already very heavy. In 1952, the total tax revenue in the United States was 79 billion US dollars; the taxes in the United Kingdom were twice as much as before the war; the taxes in France increased by 150 percent; and Italy's direct taxes will increase by 33 percent this year.

    In addition to attacking the living standards of American working people, American monopoly capitalists also demand that the people of their vassal states tighten their belts even more. Thus, the income of the British "poor" currently accounts for only 20 percent of the total national income. The lives of working people in colonies and dependent countries are particularly difficult. Workers toil for fourteen to eighteen hours a day in tea plantations, rubber plantations, rice fields, and mines, earning only a small handful of rice and a few pieces of tea. Working people live in thatched huts or dilapidated houses made of old tin and broken wooden boxes.

    The deteriorating material conditions are rapidly destroying the health of the working people, causing diseases to spread.

    Therefore, the mortality rate in capitalist countries, especially the infant mortality rate, is very high. In Turkey, 400,000 children die every year. In Bombay, India, of the 328,000 children born from 1941 to 1950, 221,000 died before the age of one. In British Somaliland, 20 percent of the total population died of cholera and malaria from 1950 to 1951.

    This is the inevitable consequence of the basic economic laws of modern capitalism.

    资本主义国家生活费用上涨人民生活困苦
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”和“消息报”在二日发表文章，用许多事实和数字说明各资本主义国家劳动人民生活困苦的情况。
    阿尔希莫夫在“真理报”写道：资本主义阵营生活费用到处上涨，赋税增加，失业人数增多，人民生活水平不断下降。从一九四七年底到一九五二年，美国面包价格上涨了百分之二十八，英国百分之九十，法国百分之一百以上；同一时期内，美国肉价上涨了百分之二十六，英国百分之三十五，法国百分之八十八。
    尽管物价不断上涨，资本家却竭力把工人的工资压在极低的水平上。结果资本主义国家的劳动人民不得不减少已经少得可怜的消费量。从一九四九年到一九五一年，法国的肉类消费量减少了百分之二十四。英国一九五一年肉类和牛油的每人平均消费量比战前减少了百分之四十。
    奥西波夫在“消息报”上评述资本主义国家统治集团的侵略政策对人民生活的影响。他写道：军费的不断增加加重了人民已经非常沉重的赋税负担。一九五二年，美国的税收总数是七百九十亿美元；英国的赋税等于战前两倍；法国的赋税增加了百分之一百五十；意大利今年的直接税还要增加百分之三十三。
    美国垄断资本家在向美国劳动人民生活水平进攻之外，还要求他们的附庸国的人民更加勒紧裤带。这样，英国“穷人”的收入目前就只占全部国民收入百分之二十。殖民地和附属国劳动人民的生活尤其困苦。工人在茶园、橡胶园、稻田和矿山里一天作苦工十四小时到十八小时，所得的仅仅是一小把米和几片茶叶。劳动人民住在草棚里，或者住在旧洋铁皮和破木箱搭成的破烂房子里。
    一天天恶化的物质条件很快地摧毁了劳动人民的健康，使得疾病流行。
    因此，资本主义世界各国的死亡率，特别是儿童的死亡率很高。土耳其每年死亡儿童四十万人。在印度孟买，一九四一年到一九五零年出生的三十二万八千个儿童里面，有二十二万一千个儿童不到一岁就死亡了。在非洲索马里兰，一九五零年到一九五一年死于霍乱和疟疾的占全体居民百分之二十。
    这就是现代资本主义基本经济法则所带来的必然后果。
