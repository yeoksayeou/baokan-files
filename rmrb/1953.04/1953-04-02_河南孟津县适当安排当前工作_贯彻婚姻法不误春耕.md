    Henan Mengjin County Appropriately Arranges Current Work
    Implementing the Marriage Law Does Not Delay Spring Plowing
    Henan Province's Mengjin County has made appropriate arrangements for spring plowing production and the movement to implement the Marriage Law, ensuring that spring plowing is not delayed while also doing a good job of implementing the Marriage Law.
    Originally, Mengjin County had divided the county and district cadres according to the principle of "two teams, separate responsibilities." As a result, the phenomenon of "each minding their own business" arose below. When studying work, some district and township cadres would set up two separate stalls: one specifically for studying spring plowing production work, regardless of the Marriage Law implementation movement; and the other specifically for studying the Marriage Law implementation work, regardless of spring plowing production work. When discussing the Marriage Law implementation month work, some township chairmen who thought they would be leading the work spoke very actively, while others who thought they were leading production remained silent. When the discussion turned to how to combine the Marriage Law implementation movement with spring plowing production, some township cadres would say, "Having to do this and that, it just won't work." The district cadres had no choice but to say, "Alright! Let's study the implementation of the Marriage Law first and not mention production."
    In order to do both spring plowing production and the Marriage Law implementation work well, the Mengjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government made specific arrangements for combining these two tasks: (1) The Marriage Law implementation movement will be carried out in two batches. On the premise of close integration with production, each township will spend about ten to fifteen days on the Marriage Law implementation movement. The cadres will be divided into two parts: one part will engage in Marriage Law implementation work while also doing a good job in local production work. "Single-handed" work is not allowed, and turning a blind eye to spring plowing production work is not allowed. The cadres engaged in production work will be divided into areas to lead the spring plowing production work in townships that have not yet started the Marriage Law implementation movement, and combine it with publicizing the Marriage Law, eliminating the masses' misconceptions, concerns, and resulting fluctuations regarding the Marriage Law implementation movement, laying a good ideological foundation for the second batch of the Marriage Law implementation movement. (2) After the cadres participating in the Marriage Law implementation movement arrive in the township, they must first convene a meeting of Party and Youth League members to convey the spirit of the movement, understand the ideological situation of the masses, and explain the purpose of their visit to the masses as early as possible to dispel their concerns, so that everyone can concentrate on production. Then, they should make a comprehensive understanding of the current spring plowing production work, make an overall plan, and arrange the schedule of spring plowing production and Marriage Law implementation work in a unified manner according to the tasks, manpower, and time. Cadres should lead production during the day and carry out the Marriage Law implementation work at night. They should try to use the rest time of collective production (such as digging ponds) to publicize and lead the masses to discuss the Marriage Law. When holding meetings of mutual aid team leaders, they can call on the team leaders to lead the team members to build harmonious and democratic families, exert productive forces, and appropriately combine production education with the publicity of the Marriage Law. It is also necessary to absorb literacy campaign and people's school teachers to participate in the study of the Marriage Law, so that they can correctly publicize the Marriage Law to the students and combine the Marriage Law implementation work with the masses' cultural learning.

    河南孟津县适当安排当前工作
    贯彻婚姻法不误春耕
    河南省孟津县把春耕生产和贯彻婚姻法运动作了适当的安排，保证不误春耕，同时做好贯彻婚姻法的工作。
    原来，孟津县曾按照“两套人马，分工负责”的原则，把县、区干部作了分工。结果下面产生了“各顾各”的现象。研究工作时，有些区乡干部就拉开两个摊子，一摊专门研究春耕生产工作，不管贯彻婚姻法运动月工作；另一摊专门研究贯彻婚姻法工作，不管春耕生产工作。在讨论贯彻婚姻法运动月工作时，有的乡主席认为自己将要领导这个工作，发言很积极；有的认为自己是领导生产的，就不吭气。一提到贯彻婚姻法运动如何结合春耕生产时，有的乡干部就说：“又要搞这，又要搞那，可不中。”区干部没法，也就说：“好吧！先研究贯彻婚姻法，不提生产。”
    为了把春耕生产和贯彻婚姻法工作都做好，中共孟津县委和县人民政府把这两项工作的结合问题作了具体安排：（一）贯彻婚姻法运动分两批搞。在紧密结合生产的前提下，每乡贯彻婚姻法运动约搞十天到十五天。干部分两部分：一部分搞贯彻婚姻法工作，同时搞好当地的生产工作，不许“单打一”，不许对春耕生产工作袖手旁观。搞生产工作的干部分工分片领导尚未开展贯彻婚姻法运动的乡的春耕生产工作，并结合宣传婚姻法，消除群众对贯彻婚姻法运动的错觉、顾虑和从而引起的波动，为第二批贯彻婚姻法运动打好思想基础。（二）参加贯彻婚姻法运动的干部到乡后，首先要召开党、团员会议，传达运动精神，了解群众思想情况，及早向群众说明来意，解除顾虑，使大家安心生产。然后把当前的春耕生产工作作通盘了解，进行通盘计划，根据任务、力量、时间，统一安排春耕生产和贯彻婚姻法工作日程。干部应该在白天领导生产，晚上进行贯彻婚姻法的工作。要尽量利用集体生产（如挖塘等）的休息时间宣传和领导群众座谈婚姻法。在召开互助组长会议时，可号召组长领导组员搞好和睦民主的家庭，发挥生产力量，把生产教育和贯彻婚姻法的宣传适当结合起来。还要吸收扫除文盲和民校的教师参加婚姻法的学习，使他们正确地向学员宣传婚姻法，把贯彻婚姻法工作和群众的文化学习结合起来。
