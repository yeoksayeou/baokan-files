    Laboring People in Capitalist Countries Live on the Brink of Starvation
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Soviet magazine "New Times" published an article in its fourteenth issue, entitled "The Impoverishment of Workers in Capitalist Countries."

    The article states that this spring brings many reports about the increasing impoverishment of laboring people in capitalist countries, especially those participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    The Marshall Plan, the Schuman Plan, and other American plans aimed at militarizing and subordinating the economies of Western Europe and other regions to American capital have caused even more suffering to the people of these countries.

    The current economic situation in capitalist countries is characterized by rising living costs, continuous inflation, and increasing prices and taxes. The direct consequence of this is the reduction of the real wages of the working masses, a decline in living standards, and impoverishment. This is the case in every capitalist country.

    The article goes on to say that even the "moderate" statistics of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, based entirely on official materials, show that in the past three years, drastic economic militarization has led to a rapid rise in the cost of living throughout Western Europe. Compared to September 1949, the cost of living in September 1952 increased by 45 percent in France, 35 percent in Norway, 28 percent in Sweden, 27 percent in Greece, 22 percent in the United Kingdom, and 21 percent in the Netherlands.

    Unemployment is increasing everywhere. Japan has nearly ten million unemployed, Indonesia has 15 million fully and partially unemployed, the United Kingdom has 500,000 fully unemployed, Italy has two million; in Canada, there are 300,000 registered unemployed, and in France, there are 600,000 fully unemployed and another 2.5 million partially unemployed.

    In the United States, the tax burden per person has increased from $117 in 1940 to $340 in 1945 and $557 in 1952. The American people spend far more on taxes than on food: in 1951, the American people spent $75 billion on taxes and only $55 billion on food.

    In France, seven million people live in substandard housing. According to French newspapers, Paris alone has 170,000 slum dwellings and another 140,000 that are absolutely unfit for human habitation. Currently, 200,000 French families need housing; 650,000 homes are listed as overcrowded, and hundreds of thousands more live in dilapidated shacks.

    In South America, the majority of people do not have adequate food and shelter. It is estimated that 90 million people in Latin America are constantly living on the brink of starvation.

    The article points out that the working class in capitalist countries is heroically fighting for the right to survive. Strike actions have expanded in these countries. In 1952, there were 4,950 strikes in the United States, involving more than 3.5 million workers. The tenacity of strike struggles in Japan, Italy, France, West Germany, and other countries is well known.

    The article concludes that the laboring people and their various organizations are responding to the bourgeoisie's offensive, economic militarization and the arms race, preparations for a new war, and intensified capitalist exploitation with powerful actions.

### 资本主义国家劳动人民生活在饥饿的边缘

    资本主义国家劳动人民生活在饥饿的边缘
    【新华社讯】苏联“新时代”杂志第十四期发表一篇文章，题目是“资本主义国家工人的贫困化”。
    文章写道，今年春天带来许多关于资本主义国家、首先是参加北大西洋联盟的国家的劳动人民愈益贫困的消息。
    马歇尔计划，舒曼计划以及其他旨在使西欧及其他地区国家经济军事化和屈从于美国资本的美国计划，给这些国家的人民造成了更多的苦难。
    资本主义国家目前经济情况的特点是：生活费用上升、通货不断膨胀以及物价和捐税日益增涨。它的直接后果是劳动群众的实际工资的减低、生活水平的下降和贫困化。每一个资本主义国家的情况都是如此。
    文章接着写道，即使联合国欧洲经济委员会完全根据官方材料所作的“温和”的统计数字也显示出，在过去三年中，剧烈的经济军事化已使整个西欧的生活费用迅速上升。与一九四九年九月比较，一九五二年九月生活费用在法国增加了百分之四十五，在挪威增加了百分之三十五，在瑞典增加了百分之二十八，在希腊增加了百分之二十七，在英国增加了百分之二十二，而在荷兰则增加了百分之二十一。
    失业到处在增加。日本失业人数将近一千万，印尼完全失业和半失业的人数已达一千五百万，英国完全失业人数有五十万，意大利有二百万；在加拿大，失业登记人数有三十万，在法国完全失业的有六十万人，还有二百五十万半失业的人。
    在美国，每人负担的捐税从一九四零年的一百一十七美元增加到一九四五年的三百四十美元和一九五二年的五百五十七美元。美国人民花在捐税上的钱远比花在食物上的为多：一九五一年，美国人民在捐税方面用去了七百五十亿美元，而用在食物方面的只有五百五十亿美元。
    在法国，有七百万人所住的房屋不合标准。据法国报纸透露，仅巴黎一地即有贫民窟住房十七万所，另有十四万所已绝对不合于人们居住。目前有二十万户法国家庭需要住房；有六十五万所被列为拥挤的房屋，此外还有成千上万的人居住在破烂的茅棚里。
    在南美洲，大多数人民得不到适当的食宿。拉丁美洲经常生活在饥饿边缘的人估计有九千万。
    文章指出，资本主义国家的工人阶级正为生存的权利而英勇地战斗着。在这些国家中，罢工行动已经扩大了。一九五二年美国发生了四千九百五十起罢工，参加罢工的工人超过三百五十万。在日本、意大利、法国、西德和一些其他国家，罢工斗争的顽强性是人所共知的。
    文章最后说，劳动人民和他们的各种组织，正以强有力的行动来回答资产阶级的进攻、经济军事化与军备竞赛、新战争的准备和加强了的资本主义剥削。
