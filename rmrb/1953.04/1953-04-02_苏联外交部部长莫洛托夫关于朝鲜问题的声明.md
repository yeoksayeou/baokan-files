The following statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding the Korean issue has been released:

On March 28th, Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, issued a reply to General Clark, Commander of the United Nations Forces in Korea, regarding the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war.

The reply expressed agreement to exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war on both sides, and pointed out that the two sides had already reached an agreement on this issue during the Korean armistice negotiations, but this exchange could not be realized earlier due to the interruption of the Panmunjom talks. The reply also expressed agreement to exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war in accordance with Article 109 of the Geneva Convention. At the same time, the reply emphasized that such an exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war should lead to a smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue, so as to achieve a Korean armistice. Therefore, the reply suggested an immediate resumption of negotiations at Panmunjom.

Subsequently, Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, and Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued statements in Beijing and Pyongyang respectively. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea both announced that they agreed to the proposal for the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, and, as before, expressed their willingness to reach an agreement on the immediate resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue, so as to end the Korean War.

Therefore, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have once again demonstrated initiative in reaching an agreement on an armistice and ending the Korean War.

I am authorized to state that the Soviet Government expresses its full agreement with this noble move by Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and has absolutely no doubt that this move will be warmly supported by the people of all countries in the world. The Soviet Government also believes that this proposal will be correctly understood by the Government of the United States of America.

The Soviet Government has consistently supported all steps aimed at achieving a just armistice and ending the Korean War.

As early as July 1950, Soviet Government leader J.V. Stalin initiated this matter in a reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

As everyone knows, the radio address delivered in New York in June 1951 by the Soviet representative to the Security Council provided the basis for the start of the Korean armistice negotiations. The armistice negotiations held first in Kaesong and later moved to Panmunjom reached agreement on all armistice terms except for the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war. However, General Clark interrupted the armistice negotiations last October, thereby hindering the conclusion of an armistice agreement.

The Chinese and Korean sides have accepted General Clark's proposal of February 22nd to exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war in accordance with Article 109 of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

This article states: "Subject to the stipulations of the third paragraph of this article, Parties to the conflict are bound to send back to their own country, regardless of number or rank, seriously wounded and seriously sick prisoners of war, after having cared for them until they are fit to travel, in accordance with the first paragraph of the following article.

"Throughout the duration of hostilities, Parties to the conflict shall endeavour, with the co-operation of neutral Powers, to make arrangements for accommodating convalescent sick and injured prisoners of war in neutral countries. In addition, they may conclude agreements for direct repatriation or internment in a neutral country of able-bodied prisoners of war who have undergone a long period of captivity.

"No sick or injured prisoner of war who is eligible for repatriation under the first paragraph of this article, may be repatriated against his will during hostilities."

This article of the Geneva Convention refers to the period before the conclusion of an armistice agreement, that is, before military operations have ceased. Since an agreement has now been reached on the adoption of this article and this agreement may be signed by both sides in the near future, there are no longer any obstacles that prevent the exchange of prisoners of war from beginning without delay.

The aforementioned letter from Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, not only expressed agreement with General Clark's proposal of February 22nd regarding the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, but also suggested resuming armistice negotiations in order to end the Korean War.

It should be particularly noted that the statement jointly drafted by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, published by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on March 30th, proposed not only the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, but also a comprehensive solution to the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, in order to conclude an armistice agreement and end the Korean War. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have proposed that, with the reasonable resolution of the issue of sick and wounded prisoners of war, both sides should resolve the entire prisoner of war issue, based on a sincere desire to achieve a Korean armistice through mutual concessions.

Naturally, the entire issue of repatriation of prisoners of war should also be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention, which, of course, the Soviet Government, as well as the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have insisted on. However, as everyone knows, neither the long-term negotiations at Panmunjom nor the repeated discussions on this issue in the United Nations General Assembly have yielded positive results.

Because this issue is the only disagreement between the belligerent parties in Korea in reaching an armistice agreement, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the desire to seek peace and end the Korean War, have taken new steps to finally resolve this issue. They propose that both sides resume armistice negotiations and guarantee the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war in their custody who insist on repatriation after the cessation of military operations, and that the remaining prisoners of war be handed over to neutral countries to ensure a fair resolution of their repatriation issue. This proposal makes it possible to fairly resolve the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war and to remove the remaining obstacles to achieving a Korean armistice.

There is no doubt that the people of the world and those who sincerely hope to end the Korean War and promote the consolidation of peace and security for the people of all countries in the Far East and the world will welcome this proposal with warm sympathy and give it full support.

The Soviet Government believes that this proposal by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is completely just and expresses its willingness to do its best to promote its realization.

Of course, if China and Korea had legitimate representatives in the United Nations Organization, it could do more to achieve a armistice and end the Korean War.

The fact that the Chinese and Korean people have been deprived of their legitimate representation in the United Nations Organization undermines the prestige of this organization in the first place, and secondly, makes it impossible for it to fulfill its responsibility to promote the consolidation of international security and universal peace.

The Soviet Government believes it is its duty to remind once again that the issue of restoring the rights of the Chinese and Korean people in the United Nations Organization is one of the most pressing issues; restoring the rights of China and Korea in the United Nations Organization, especially in the current situation, is in the interests of enhancing the prestige of the United Nations Organization and its international significance, and will contribute to the consolidation of world peace.

### 苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫关于朝鲜问题的声明

    苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫关于朝鲜问题的声明
    三月二十八日，朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀就交换病伤战俘问题给朝鲜联合国军总司令克拉克将军的复信发表了。
    复信表示同意交换双方病伤战俘，并指出：在朝鲜停战谈判过程中，双方本已就这个问题达成协议，只因板门店谈判中断，此项交换无法早日实现。复信并表示同意按照日内瓦公约第一百零九条的规定，在战争期间交换双方病伤战俘。同时，复信并强调指出，这样的交换双方病伤战俘，应当使之引导到全部战俘问题的顺利解决，从而使朝鲜停战得以实现。因此，复信建议立即恢复在板门店的谈判。
    随后，中华人民共和国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成分别在北京和平壤发表了声明。中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府都宣布它们同意交换病伤战俘的建议，并且都和从前一样表示愿意达成关于立即解决全部战俘问题的协议，从而使朝鲜战争得以结束。
    因此，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已再一次在达成关于停战和结束朝鲜战争的协议上表现了首倡精神。
    我受权声明：苏联政府对于中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这种崇高的举动表示完全赞同，并且毫不怀疑这种举动将得到全世界各国人民的热烈拥护。苏联政府并相信：这个建议将得到美利坚合众国政府的正确理解。
    苏联政府一贯支持一切旨在达成公正的停战和结束朝鲜战争的步骤。
    早在一九五零年七月，苏联政府领袖约·维·斯大林在给印度总理尼赫鲁先生的复电中就给这件事做了一个开端。
    大家知道，苏联驻安全理事会的代表一九五一年六月在纽约发表的广播演说为朝鲜停战谈判的开始提供了基础。先在开城、后来移到板门店举行的停战谈判，除了遣返战俘问题以外，在一切停战条款上都达成了协议。可是，克拉克将军去年十月间中断了停战谈判，从而阻碍了停战协定的缔结。
    中朝方面已接受了克拉克将军提出的、按照关于战俘待遇的一九四九年日内瓦公约第一百零九条交换双方病伤战俘的建议。
    这一条说：“除受本条第三项之规定之限制外，冲突各方必须遵照下条第一项之规定，将经过治疗后适于旅行之重伤与重病之战俘，不论其数目或等级如何，遣返其本国。
    “在战事期间，冲突各方，应依有关中立国之合作，努力商定办法使下条第二项所列之患病及受伤战俘收容于中立国。此外，彼等并得缔结协定，俾将经过长期在俘之健壮战俘直接遣返，或拘禁于中立国。
    “根据本条第一项之规定有资格被遣返之患病或受伤之战俘，在战事期间不得违反其意志将其遣返。”
    日内瓦公约的这一条指的是缔结停战协定以前，即军事行动尚未停止的时期。既然在采用这一条上现在已经达成协议并且这一协议可能在最近的将来由双方签字，所以已没有任何障碍可以使不再拖延地开始交换战俘一事不能进行。
    上述朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀的信中，不仅对克拉克将军二月二十二日所提的关于交换病伤战俘的建议表示同意，并且建议恢复停战谈判，以结束朝鲜战争。
    应该特别注意的是：周恩来外交部长三月三十日发表的、中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府共同拟定的声明中建议，不仅交换病伤战俘而且通盘解决遣返战俘的问题，以缔结停战协定和结束朝鲜战争。中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府方面建议，随着病伤战俘问题的合理解决，双方都从以互相让步而达成朝鲜停战的真诚愿望出发，解决整个战俘问题。
    自然，整个遣返战俘问题也应该按照日内瓦公约的规定来解决，关于这一点，当然苏联政府以及中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府是坚持了的。可是，无论是板门店的长期谈判，还是联合国大会对这个问题的多次讨论，大家知道，都没有获得积极的结果。
    因为这个问题是在朝鲜的交战双方达成停战协定的唯一分歧，所以中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府本着谋求和平和结束朝鲜战争的愿望，采取了新的步骤，以最后解决这一问题。它们建议：双方恢复停战谈判并保证在军事行动停止以后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。这个建议使有可能公正地解决遣返战俘问题和扫除在实现朝鲜停战上的其余障碍。
    毫无疑问，全世界的人民和真诚希望结束朝鲜战争和促进远东及全世界各国人民的和平与安全之巩固的人们，将以热烈的同情欢迎这个建议，并给它以充分的支持。
    苏联政府认为中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这一建议是完全公正的，并表示愿意尽力促其实现。
    当然，如果在联合国组织中有中国和朝鲜的合法代表，它就可以在停战和结束朝鲜战争上多做些事情。
    中国人民和朝鲜人民被剥夺了在联合国组织中的合法代表权这一事实，首先是破坏着这个组织的威信，其次是使它不可能尽责促成国际安全的巩固和普遍和平。
    苏联政府认为自己有责任重新提醒：关于恢复中国人民和朝鲜人民在联合国组织中的权利的问题是刻不容缓的问题之一；恢复中国和朝鲜在联合国组织中的权利，特别是在目前的情况下，符合于提高联合国组织的威信及其国际意义的利益，并将促成世界和平的巩固。
