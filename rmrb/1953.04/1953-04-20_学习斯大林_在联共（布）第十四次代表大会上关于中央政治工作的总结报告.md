Studying Stalin’s “Report on the Summary of the Central Political Work at the Fourteenth Congress of the CPSU(B)”
Zhang Yu

In his report on the summary of the central political work at the Fourteenth Party Congress, Comrade Stalin further developed the theory of building socialism in one country and the victory of socialism. Based on a profound analysis of the international and domestic situation in the Soviet Union at that time (the end of 1925), he put forward the policy and line of realizing the industrialization of the socialist country as the central task of socialist construction at that time; and pointed out that another major task of the Party at that time was to ensure a solid alliance between the working class and the poor and middle peasants, and to absorb the peasants into socialist construction, so as to build and build a socialist society with the country’s own strength. The Fourteenth Congress of the CPSU(B) approved Comrade Stalin’s report. Thus, the struggle for socialist industrialization and the struggle for socialist victory became the central task of the Communist Party at that time. This article is a note of my study of Comrade Stalin's report, focusing on the theory of national industrialization and building socialism together with the peasants.

I. Comrade Stalin elaborated here on the two basic principles regarding socialist construction in the Soviet Union and striving for socialist victory, based on the characteristics of the international and domestic situation in the Soviet Union at that time.

The first basic principle points out that the Soviet Union's economic construction at that time was not only carried out in an environment of opposition and struggle against international capitalist economy, but also in an environment of opposition and struggle between different economic components in the country, namely, socialist economic components and capitalist economic components.

At that time, the whole world saw two fundamentally different stabilities, namely, the local and temporary stability of capitalism, and the sound and increasingly consolidated stability of the Soviet Union. On the basis of these two stabilities, a temporary equilibrium was generated between the capitalist world and the socialist Soviet Union, and a period of "peaceful coexistence" between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries was opened, giving the Soviet Union a respite to engage in planned, large-scale socialist economic construction.

At that time, after more than four years of intensive restoration work, both agriculture and industry in the Soviet Union's national economy were restored in a relatively short period of time and approached the pre-war level due to the superiority of the Soviet economic system. Although there were still five economic components in the Soviet Union's entire national economy at that time, socialist industry and commerce had already occupied a dominant position in the entire national economy. In particular, socialist industry had exceeded the proportion of private industry in terms of production and capital, and had grown faster than private enterprises; and by using the concentration and organization of socialist industry itself, relying on the proletarian dictatorship of the state, and relying on the proletarian state to hold state commerce, transportation organs, credit system, banks, etc., it established the leading position of socialist industry in the entire national economy, and began to subordinate private capital to itself, so that all other economic components adapt to itself. However, the production of peasant small private owners still dominated the total amount of production at this time, and the pre-war economy was a backward level. Therefore, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Soviet Union was still an agricultural country, and still a country that was technically and economically backward. The Soviet Union's economic system at that time was still a transitional economic system. He said: "... On the whole, our system cannot be called a capitalist system, nor can it be called a socialist system. On the whole, our system is a transitional system from capitalism to socialism." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 49)

Comrade Stalin's first basic principle on socialist construction was obtained based on the above analysis of the specific international and domestic situation. According to this basic principle, in order to overcome the backward state of the Soviet Union in terms of technology and economy at that time, and in order to ensure the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin put forward the line of socialist economic construction and the policy of industrialization of the socialist state in the Soviet Union, and regarded the realization of industrialization of the socialist state as the basic link of socialist construction at that time. He instructed that the Soviet economy must follow the road of independence and self-reliance to develop, that is, the Soviet Union must be built and developed as an independent economic unit; this independent economic unit should mainly rely on the Soviet Union's own resources, rely on the domestic market, and rely on the combination of socialist industry and peasant economy. Therefore, he instructed that the socialist industry of the Soviet Union must be expanded to the maximum extent, and socialism must be built and a socialist society must be built from the socialist state industrialization. He said: "To turn our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country capable of producing the necessary equipment by its own strength - this is the essence and foundation of our general line." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 92)

That is to say: first of all, it is necessary to focus on the development of heavy industry, and turn the Soviet Union into a modern industrial country that can produce its own means of production and production tools, and can equip and arm all production departments of the entire national economy with its own means of production and production tools. Because the development of heavy industry, "the realization of national industrialization can ensure the economic independence of our country, consolidate its national defense capabilities, and create the necessary conditions for the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union." ("A Brief History of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of the Soviet Union", Chapter 9) Because "socialist state industrialization is the basic link by which the work of socialist national economic construction is expanded." (Ibid.) According to another statement by Comrade Stalin, under the conditions of the Soviet Union, industry is socialism, and is the foundation, beginning, and end of socialist construction. Because state industrialization first means the growth of the working class.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that the starting point of this line also lies in being able to "attract the center of other countries that are gradually breaking away from the capitalist system and entering the socialist economic track" (original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 39). Comrade Stalin's instructions are of great internationalist significance. Today, the world peace and democracy camp is able to center on the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries and New China are able to rapidly restore the destroyed national economy and embark on socialist and industrialization construction, relying on Comrade Stalin's general line and its first victory in the Soviet Union, relying on the Soviet Union's internationalist assistance, and being able to follow this line to carry out construction.

Comrade Stalin's principles and lines on socialist construction and national industrialization, like all Marxist-Leninist theories and policies, fully reflect the requirements of economic development, and are the specific manifestation of the objective law of socialist economic development in the Soviet Union at that time.

Comrade Stalin, who is familiar with economic laws, also formulated the second principle on socialist construction and industrialization construction, pointing out that the leadership of Soviet economic construction must be carried out in accordance with the line of socialist planned economy, and specifically stipulated the leadership principles and lines of socialist planned economy. It pointed out that in socialist countries, every serious stagnation in production and commerce, and every serious mistake in economic work, will hit the entire national economy. For this reason, Comrade Stalin demanded that in construction work and leadership, we should be particularly prudent, particularly wise, extremely brilliant, and extremely cautious, so that mistakes can be reduced as much as possible and extreme correctness can be achieved. And it is required that a certain amount of reserve resources must be maintained in design work and construction to prevent accidents and inevitable mistakes. Secondly, Comrade Stalin also put forward the principle of practicing strict economy. He instructed: "Since we live on our own accumulated resources, we should be particularly thrifty in consuming the accumulated resources, and every kopeck should be used reasonably, that is, every kopeck should be used for the kind of business that must be developed at present." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 42) Again, Comrade Stalin pointed out that leading socialist economic construction must take care of the overall situation, take care of the whole, and oppose one-sided emphasis on partial interests and partial needs. He pointed out that if agricultural loans are to be increased, the needs of industrial development must be taken into account; if industrial funds are to be increased, both the strength of the industrial funds themselves and the needs of agricultural loans must be taken into account; if major equipment is to be imported from foreign countries, it must be taken into account whether foreign trade will be in deficit, and whether the deficit will cause financial destruction, and finance is "the only foundation on which industry relies for planning and development." Also, if foreign trade is to be developed, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the domestic market situation must be noted, so that the supply of cities will not be difficult because of this, that is, the rapid increase in the prices of agricultural products should not be caused because of this, because this will undermine the wage plan, artificially create famine, and produce all other consequences arising therefrom. Also, if workers' wages are to be raised, it must not affect industrial profits, nor should it affect industrial capital accumulation, etc.

II. Here, Comrade Stalin also specifically and profoundly analyzed the situation of the various classes in the Soviet Union at that time and their interrelationships. At that time, the material conditions of workers and peasants in the Soviet Union had improved with the restoration of the national economy. He pointed out: "The improvement of the material conditions of the working class and the peasantry is a necessary prerequisite for the progress of our construction cause. We see that we already have these prerequisites here." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 62) Along with the improvement of material conditions, the political enthusiasm of the workers and peasants also increased at the same time. Therefore, Comrade Stalin once again elaborated on Lenin's three slogans on the peasant issue corresponding to the three periods of the Russian revolution, and further elaborated on the theory that the proletariat must unite with the peasants to participate in socialist construction and build a socialist society. He pointed out that when the Soviet Union had repelled the armed intervention of imperialism, fully consolidated its regime, and had entered the stage of extensive socialist construction, Lenin put forward the third slogan on the peasant issue - that is, the slogan of the proletariat and the poor and middle peasants forming a solid alliance. Stalin pointed out that this slogan was the only correct slogan in the Soviet environment at that time, and the reason why it was the only correct slogan was first of all because the construction of socialism should not only include cities, but also rural areas, and should include both industry and agriculture, and build them as a unified whole of the entire socialist national economy, and "the fate of the countryside should originally follow the city, and should follow the big industry." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 50) Secondly, because when building socialism, it is necessary to use huge forces in the countryside in order to isolate the rich peasants, and defeat and overcome the capitalist components. For this reason, it is necessary to combine industry and agriculture according to the principle of socialist public ownership. "Without combining these two economic sectors, there can be no socialism." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 64) Thirdly, because since the October Revolution implemented land nationalization, the proletarian state helped the peasants drive away the landlords and eradicate feudal exploitation, the countryside has mostly been middle-peasantized, and the middle peasants have occupied the majority in the countryside. Especially since the Fourteenth Party Congress decided to change the policy in the countryside, the middle peasants have stood on the side of the proletariat and helped the proletarian state in the struggle against the rich peasants. Based on the above analysis, Stalin pointed out that the policy of uniting the middle peasants is the only correct policy at that time to absorb the peasants into the socialist construction cause, and it is an unshakable policy of the Party. For this reason, he proposed: (1) ensuring the alliance between the proletariat and the rural poor peasants and the middle peasants; (2) ensuring the leading role of the proletariat in this alliance; (3) politically isolating and economically squeezing out the rich peasants and urban capitalists, as the most important tasks of the Party in class work at that time. At the same time, he also proposed "absorbing peasant households into socialist construction by widely promoting the cooperative system and improving the cultural level of peasants." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 77), as a major task in the socialist development of agriculture.

Of course, the proletariat uniting with the middle peasants does not mean that the poor peasants are not needed, or that the poor peasants can be forgotten. Stalin instructed that when there are still poor peasants, the proletariat should form an alliance with the poor peasants, and the poor peasants should still be the social pillar on which the proletariat should rely in the countryside, acting as the agent of the Soviet democratic system led by the proletariat in the countryside. Moreover, the proletarian state should specifically stipulate the conditions, methods, and ways to help the poor peasants politically and materially, in order to improve the material conditions of the poor peasants, and enable them to organize themselves into independent political forces under the leadership of the Communist Party, and become the organized forces on which the proletariat can rely in the countryside to fight against the rich peasants and strive for and unite the middle peasants.

For this reason, Comrade Stalin pointed out that it is necessary to overcome the two dangers and tendencies that existed in the Party at that time on the peasant issue. One tendency is to underestimate the danger of the rich peasants, and the other tendency is to be flustered in front of the rich peasants and thus underestimate the role of the middle peasants. Stalin pointed out: "Both tendencies are very bad. If these two tendencies are allowed to develop, they can disintegrate and harm the Party. Fortunately, there is a force in our Party that can break these two tendencies together." (Original book, Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, page 74)

The principle and policy of the proletariat forming a solid alliance with the peasants, absorbing the peasants into socialist construction and building a socialist society, is a very important part of Lenin and Stalin's theory of building socialism in one country and the victory of socialism. They are also one of the brilliant examples of Lenin and Stalin's genius in using economic laws for the benefit of mankind, and one of the specific manifestations of the objective law of the economic development process. Because Stalin pointed out: "In the field of economics, the discovery and application of new laws that violate the interests of the declining forces of society will encounter extremely strong resistance from these forces. Therefore, there must be a force capable of overcoming this resistance, a social force. In our country, this force has been found, in the form of the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, which accounts for the vast majority of society." ("The Problems of Socialist Economics in the Soviet Union", People's Publishing House Edition, page 6)

Therefore, building and building socialism relying on the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the proletariat can also be said to be the third basic principle on socialist construction and socialist victory.

Implementing national industrialization, taking national industrialization as the basic link of socialist construction, and leading economic construction and economic work in accordance with the principles of planned economy, this guarantees the completely independent and self-reliant development path of the Soviet economy, guarantees the consolidation of the Soviet Union's national defense forces, guarantees the conditions for the victory of the socialist economy, and enables the Soviet economy to embark on the path of planned development. And relying on the worker-peasant alliance, building socialism together with the peasants under the leadership of the proletariat, enables the Soviet Union to have sufficient strength to overcome and smash the resistance of all internal and external enemies in socialist construction, and can bring the agricultural economy into the orbit of socialist construction through the cooperative system, ensuring the victory of socialism in the entire national economy. Industrialization in turn provides the necessary material basis for the socialist transformation of agriculture. This makes the Soviet Union possess the complete conditions and guarantees for victory in building socialism with its own strength in the environment of fighting against domestic and foreign capitalist economies.

In addition, Comrade Stalin also repeatedly elaborated in the report on the leading role of the Communist Party in the proletarian dictatorship and the cause of socialist economic construction, the great significance of unity within the Party, and the ways and methods to achieve unity within the Party, which are also very important contributions of Comrade Stalin to socialist construction and Party building.

Now our large-scale economic construction has begun, and the struggle to realize national industrialization has become our current central task. Therefore, carefully studying Comrade Stalin's work is of great practical significance to our construction cause.

    学习斯大林“在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上关于中央政治工作的总结报告”
    张鱼
    斯大林同志在第十四次党代表大会关于中央政治工作的总结报告中，进一步发展了关于在一国内建设社会主义和社会主义胜利的理论。他根据对当时
    （一九二五年底）苏联国际和国内形势深刻分析的结果，提出了实现社会主义国家工业化的方针和路线，作为当时社会主义建设的中心任务；并指出了当时党的另一个重大任务，是要保证工人阶级及贫农和中农结成坚固的联盟，吸收农民参加社会主义建设，以便用一国自己的力量来建设并建成社会主义社会。联共（布）第十四次代表大会批准了斯大林同志这一报告。于是为社会主义工业化而斗争，为社会主义胜利而斗争，便成了当时联共党的中心任务。本文是我学习斯大林同志这个报告的笔记，着重说明关于国家工业化和联合农民一起建设社会主义的理论。一斯大林同志在这里根据当时苏联国际形势和国内形势的特点，阐发了关于苏联社会主义建设和争取社会主义胜利的两个基本原理。
    第一个基本原理指出：当时苏联的经济建设不仅是要在和国际资本主义经济相对立及斗争的环境中来进行，而且还要在国内不同的经济成份，即社会主义经济成份和资本主义经济成份相对立及斗争的环境中进行。
    当时整个世界出现了两种根本不同的稳定，即资本主义的局部的暂时的稳定，和苏联的健全的日愈巩固的稳定。在这两种稳定的基础上，产生了当时资本主义世界和苏联社会主义国家间暂时的均势，并开辟了苏联和资本主义国家间的“和平共处”时期，使苏联得到了整整一个暂息的时机，可以从事有计划的大规模的社会主义经济建设。
    当时苏联的国民经济，经过了四年余紧张的恢复工作，无论农业和工业都因苏联经济制度的优越而在一个比较短促的时期内恢复过来，而接近战前水平了。虽然当时苏联整个国民经济中还存在着五种经济成份，但是社会主义的工业和商业，已在整个国民经济中占了优势。特别是社会主义工业，在生产量和资金方面的比重，已超过私人工业的比重，增长得比私人企业更快；并且利用社会主义工业本身的集中性和组织性，依靠无产阶级专政的国家，依靠无产阶级国家手里掌握着国家商业、运输机关、信用制度和银行等等，建立了社会主义工业在整个国民经济中的领导地位，开始使私人资本服从于自己，使其余一切经济成份都适应于自己。但在生产品总量中，农民小私有主的生产这时候还占着优势，加以战前的经济是一个落后的水平，因此斯大林同志指出：当时苏联还是一个农业国，还是一个在技术上和经济上都落后的国家。当时苏联的经济制度，还是过渡的经济制度。他说：“……整个说来，我国制度终究是既不能称为资本主义的制度，也不能称为社会主义的制度。整个说来，我国的制度，乃是由资本主义进到社会主义的过渡制度。”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版，第四十九页）
    斯大林同志关于社会主义建设的第一个基本原理，就是根据以上关于国际国内具体形势的分析出发而获得的。根据这一基本原理，为了克服当时苏联技术上经济上的落后状态，为了使社会主义在苏联一国建设的胜利，斯大林同志就提出了苏联社会主义经济建设的路线和社会主义国家工业化的方针，并且把实现社会主义国家工业化作为当时社会主义建设的基本环节。他指示苏联经济必须遵循独立自主的道路去发展，即必须把苏联作为一个独立的经济单位来建设来发展；这种独立的经济单位主要应依靠苏联自己的资源，依靠国内市场，依靠社会主义工业和农民经济间的结合。因此，他指示必须最大限度地扩展苏联的社会主义工业，必须从社会主义的国家工业化来进行建设社会主义，并建成社会主义社会。他说：“把我国由农业国变成能自力出产必需装备品的工业国，——这就是我们总路线底实质和基础。”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第九十二页）
    这也就是说：首先要着重发展重工业，把苏联变为能够自己生产生产资料和生产工具，能够以自己的生产资料和生产工具来装备来武装整个国民经济各生产部门的现代化的工业国家。因为发展重工业，“实现国家工业化，就能保证我国经济独立，巩固其国防能力，并造成社会主义在苏联胜利所必需的条件。”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”第九章）因为“社会主义的国家工业化，是社会主义国民经济建设工作所借以扩展的基本环节。”（同上）照斯大林同志另一种说法，在苏联的条件下，工业就是社会主义，就是社会主义建设的基础、开端及终结。因为国家工业化首先意味着工人阶级的增长。
    斯大林同志指出这条路线的出发点也在于为了能够“吸引其他一切逐渐脱离资本主义体系而进入社会主义经济轨道的国家的中心”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第三十九页）。斯大林同志的这些指示，是具有莫大的国际主义的意义的。今天世界和平民主阵营之所以能以苏联为中心，各人民民主国家和新中国所以能迅速恢复了被破坏的国民经济，并着手从事社会主义和工业化的建设，就是依靠了斯大林同志这一总路线和它在苏联的首先胜利，就是依靠了苏联国际主义的帮助，并能够遵循这一路线来进行建设。
    斯大林同志这一关于社会主义建设和国家工业化的原理和路线，正如马克思列宁主义所有的一切理论和政策一样，完全地反映了经济发展的要求，是当时苏联社会主义经济发展客观规律性的具体表现。
    熟悉经济法则的斯大林同志，又制定了关于社会主义建设和工业化建设的第二个原理，指出苏联经济建设的领导必须按照社会主义计划经济的路线来进行，并且具体地规定了社会主义计划经济的领导原则和路线。指出在社会主义国家里，生产和商业中的每一次严重的阻滞，经济工作中每一个严重错失，都会打击到全部国民经济。为此，斯大林同志要求在建设工作和领导方面，都应当特别审慎，特别明达，极端高明，极端审慎，务使错失尽量减少，做到极端正确无误。并要求在设计工作和进行建设时候，必须保有一定的后备资源，以防意外和不可避免的错失。其次，斯大林同志又提出了必须厉行节约的原则。他指示：“我们既然是靠自己积蓄的资源过活，那末我们在消耗所积蓄的资源方面也就应该特别节俭，每个哥比都要用得合理，即应该把每个哥比用到目前绝对必需发展的那种事业上去。（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第四十二页）再次，斯大林同志指出领导社会主义经济建设，必须照顾全局，照顾整体，反对片面强调局部利益和部分需要。他指出，如要增加农业贷款，必须照顾到工业发展的需要；如要增加工业经费，既须照顾到工业本身资金的力量，又要照顾到农业贷款发放的需要；如要从外国输入主要装备品，必须照顾到对外贸易是否会入超，是否会因入超而引起金融的破坏，而金融是“工业所赖以计划和发展的唯一基础”。又如要发展对外贸易，斯大林同志指出：必须注意到国内市场的状况，务使城市供给不因此而发生困难，即不要因此而引起农产品价格的急速提高，因为这样会使工资计划遭受破坏，用人工方法造成饥荒以及由此而产生其他一切后果。又如要提高工人工资，则必须不使工业赢利遭受影响，不要影响到工业资金积累等等。二斯大林同志在这里又具体深刻地分析了当时苏联各阶级的状况和它们的相互关系。当时苏联工人和农民的物质状况随着国民经济的恢复已经有所改善了。他指出：“工人阶级和农民物质状况的改善，乃是我国建设事业向前进展的必要前提。我们眼见，我们这里已经有了这些前提。”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第六十二页）伴随着物质状况的改善，工农群众的政治积极性也同时提高了。因此，斯大林同志再一次阐发了列宁在农民问题上相当于俄国革命三个时期的三个口号，并进一步阐发了无产阶级必须联合农民参加社会主义建设，并建成社会主义社会的理论。他指出当苏联已击退帝国主义武装干涉，充分巩固了自己的政权，并且已经进到广泛建设社会主义的阶段，列宁提出了对农民问题的第三个口号——即无产阶级及贫农和中农实行坚固联盟的口号。斯大林指出这口号在当时苏联环境中是唯一正确的口号，其所以是唯一正确的，首先是因为建设社会主义不仅应包括城市，而且要包括农村，应包括工业和农业两大部门，并且把它们作为整个社会主义国民经济的一个统一的整体来进行建设，而“农村底命运本来也就是应该跟着城市走，应该跟着大工业走。”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第五○页）其次是因为建设社会主义时必须在农村中运用巨大力量，这样才能孤立富农，战胜并克服资本主义成份。为此，必须根据社会主义公有制的原则，把工业和农业结合起来。“不把这两个经济部门结合起来，便不能有什么社会主义。”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第六十四页）再次是因为苏联自从十月革命实行土地国有，无产阶级国家帮助农民赶走了地主，铲除了封建剥削，农村已多半中农化了，中农已在农村中占了大多数。尤其是自从十四次党代表大会决定农村中的政策转变以后，中农已经站到了无产阶级方面来，帮助了无产阶级国家对富农的斗争。根据上述分析，斯大林指出，联合中农的政策乃是当时吸收农民参加社会主义建设事业的唯一正确的政策，是党不可动摇的政策。为此，他提出了：（一）保证无产阶级和乡村贫农同中农建立联盟；（二）保证无产阶级在这联盟中的领导作用；（三）在政治上孤立和在经济上排挤富农及城市资本家，作为当时党在阶级工作方面的最重要的任务。同时他又提出了“用广泛推行合作制和提高农民文化水准的办法，吸收农户参加社会主义建设。”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第七十七页），作为农业中社会主义发展的一个主要任务。
    当然，无产阶级联合中农，并不是说不要贫农，或者可以把贫农忘掉了。斯大林指示：当还有贫农存在时，无产阶级就应和贫农成立联盟，并且贫农仍应是无产阶级在农村中所应依靠的社会支柱，充当无产阶级领导的苏维埃民主制度在乡村中的代理人。而且无产阶级国家应当具体规定从政治上和物质上帮助贫农的条件、方法和方式，以便提高贫农的物质状况，并使他们有可能在共产党领导下组织成为独立的政治力量，成为无产阶级在农村中可能依靠来进行反对富农争取和联合中农的有组织的力量。
    为此，斯大林同志指出必须克服当时党内在农民问题上所存在的两种危险和倾向。一种倾向是小视富农危险，另一种倾向是在富农面前张惶失措因而看轻了中农的作用。斯大林指出：“两种倾向都很坏。如果让这两种倾向发展下去，那它们就能瓦解和戕害党。幸而我们党内有能于把这两种倾向一同打破的力量。”（原书，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第七十四页）
    无产阶级和农民结成坚固联盟，吸收农民参加社会主义建设并建成社会主义社会这一原理和政策，是列宁、斯大林关于在一国内建设社会主义和社会主义胜利的理论中非常重要的部分。它们也是列宁、斯大林天才地运用经济法则为人类谋福利的光辉范例之一，也是经济发展过程客观规律性的具体体现之一。因为斯大林指出：“在经济学领域中，发现和应用那些触犯社会衰朽力量的利益的新法则，却要遇到这些力量极强烈的反抗。因此，必须有能够克服这种反抗的力量，社会力量。在我国，找到了这种力量，其形式就是占社会绝大多数的工人阶级和农民的联盟。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”，人民出版社版，第六页）
    因此，在无产阶级领导下依靠工农联盟建设并建成社会主义，也可以说是关于社会主义建设与社会主义胜利的第三个基本原理。
    实施国家工业化，把国家工业化作为社会主义建设的基本环节，并按照计划经济的原则来领导经济建设与经济工作，这就保证了苏联经济完全独立自主的发展道路，保证了苏联国防力量的巩固，保证了社会主义经济胜利的条件，并使苏联经济走上有计划发展的道路。而依靠工农联盟，在无产阶级领导下和农民一起建设社会主义，就使苏联在社会主义建设中，有了克服和粉碎一切内外敌人反抗的充分力量，并能把农业经济通过合作制纳入社会主义建设的轨道，保证社会主义在整个国民经济中的胜利。工业化则又为农业中的社会主义改造提供着必要的物质基础。这样就使苏联在和国内外资本主义经济相斗争的环境中，用一国自己的力量建设社会主义，具备了完全胜利的条件和保证。
    此外，斯大林同志在报告中还反复阐述了共产党对无产阶级专政和对社会主义经济建设事业的领导作用，党内统一的重大意义以及达到党内统一的途径和方法，这些也都是斯大林同志对社会主义建设和党的建设方面极重要的贡献。
    现在我们大规模的经济建设开始了，为实现国家工业化而斗争，已是我们当前的中心任务。因此，认真学习斯大林同志这部著作，实对我们的建设事业具有重大的现实意义。
