Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The United States, Britain, France, and West Germany have recently held a series of talks in Washington. These talks not only failed to ease the tension between the United States and Western Europe but have further exacerbated it. This situation has cast an ominous shadow over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting scheduled for April 23.
    From March 4 to 7, the U.S. government held talks with British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler. From March 26 to 28, the U.S. government held talks with French Premier Mayer. From April 7 to 9, the U.S. government held talks with West German "government" Chancellor Adenauer. These were the first formal talks held by the U.S. government under the new Eisenhower administration with its Western European "allies."
    Shortly after the Eisenhower government came to power, the new Secretary of State Dulles made a tour of Western European countries in early February of this year. Dulles openly exerted crude pressure on Western European governments, urging them to step up their military expansion, especially to quickly establish a "European Army" with West German fascist troops at its core. Dulles also gave Western European countries, which had been slow to ratify the "European Army" treaty, a deadline of April to approve the treaty. Dulles everywhere threatened the Western European ruling groups in ultimatum-like tones that if they did not follow the orders of the United States, the United States would no longer give them dollars. However, American newspapers had to admit that the new pressure from the United States aroused widespread indignation among various strata in Western European countries, bringing relations between the United States and Western Europe to an unprecedented level of tension.
    The Eisenhower government then decided to hold formal talks with Western European governments. The U.S. government attempted to force Western Europe to accept U.S. demands and ease mutual tensions through this series of talks. The U.S. government hoped that these talks would lay the foundation for the NATO Council meeting scheduled for April 23 in Paris so that the U.S. military expansion plan in Western Europe could achieve "decisive progress" at this meeting. Now that this series of talks has come to an end, the United States has not been able to achieve its goals.
    During these talks in Washington, the agenda on European issues mainly discussed two issues. One was the "European Army" plan centered on the rearmament of West Germany. The other was the economic crisis caused by military expansion in Western Europe.
    On the "European Army" issue, it seems that the only talks that could satisfy the United States were those with West German Chancellor Adenauer. Before the talks, Adenauer had forced the West German Federal Parliament to hastily approve the "European Army" treaty. During the talks, the two sides reached an agreement to accelerate the organization of West German armed forces. Immediately after arriving in the United States, Adenauer publicly declared to reporters that he was "willing to openly accept any opinions put forward by the United States." Naturally, it was not difficult for the United States to reach an agreement with such a person. However, this agreement did not solve the problems faced by the United States. Because Adenauer's attitude cannot represent the broad masses of the West German people and a large part of the bourgeoisie, who are increasingly determined to demand the unification of Germany and oppose the "European Army" plan that deepens the division of Germany.
    The agreement between the United States and Adenauer clearly reflects the U.S. policy of supporting West German militarists as U.S. constables to rule Western Europe. This policy, which threatens the vital interests of Western European countries, not only cannot truly "unify" Western Europe under the command of the United States but also deepens the contradictions between the United States and Western Europe, as well as within Western Europe. In the U.S.-France talks, despite the "tough" policy adopted by the United States, demanding that France find a way to quickly approve the "European Army" treaty, the French side still avoided providing the United States with a definite guarantee and insisted on resolving the Saar issue before approving the "European Army" treaty. The French rulers have worked hard for the U.S. "European Army" plan, but they have had to adopt some reservations when accepting U.S. orders. This is because they cannot help but see that in France, not only the broad masses of the people but also many bourgeois figures, and even some senior officers in the army, oppose the "European Army" treaty. The revival of West German militarism makes the French bourgeoisie uneasy, and some of its more sober representatives have openly advocated discussing the unification of Germany through negotiations between the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France to avoid the danger of establishing a "European Army."
    As for Britain, the Washington talks also failed to change its attitude. The British government still refuses to participate in the "European Army."
    The series of talks in Washington failed to extricate the U.S. "European Army" plan from its precarious situation. American news agencies admit that the plan is still in "the most difficult stage."
    The U.S. attempt fell through in the U.S.-British and U.S.-French talks. And the expectations of Britain and France for the Washington talks also received disappointing answers.
    The main issue that the British government was interested in at the Washington conference was the economic issue. Military expansion and the U.S. squeeze in the capitalist world market have led to a serious trade deficit in Britain, which relies mainly on foreign trade. The total trade deficit for the whole of last year reached 788.8 million pounds. In order to salvage this dangerous situation, Britain demanded in the talks that the United States lower the tariff barriers that prevent British goods from entering the United States, that the United States raise the price of gold purchased in the Sterling Area, that the United States raise the price of raw materials purchased in the Sterling Area, and that the United States provide tens of billions of dollars as a fund to stabilize the continuously falling value of the pound. However, the United States refused to specifically discuss these demands during the talks.
    Military expansion and the war of aggression in Vietnam have also brought France's finances to the brink of bankruptcy. France's budget deficit this year has reached the astronomical figure of 820 billion francs. Before the U.S.-French talks, French newspapers revealed that the French government intended to ask the United States for one billion dollars in "aid" in the talks as war expenses for the war of aggression in Vietnam to make up for the French financial deficit. However, France did not get any concrete results from the talks.
    The results of the U.S.-British and U.S.-French talks have failed to satisfy any part of British and French society. The British "Times" said that the "lack of positive results" in the U.S.-British talks has caused "disappointment" in Britain. No French newspapers have made positive comments on the U.S.-French talks.

### 美国和英国、法国、西德的矛盾日益尖锐

    美国和英国、法国、西德的矛盾日益尖锐
    【新华社讯】美国和英国、法国、西德政府最近在华盛顿举行了一连串的会谈。这些会谈不仅没有缓和美国与西欧间的紧张关系，而且使这种紧张关系更加发展了。这种情况已给定于四月二十三日举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议投下了不祥的暗影。
    三月四日至七日，美国政府与英国外交大臣艾登和财政大臣巴特勒会谈。三月二十六日至二十八日，美国政府与法国总理迈耶会谈。四月七日至九日，美国政府与西德波恩“政府”总理阿登纳会谈。这些是美国艾森豪威尔新政府上台后与其西欧“盟国”所举行的第一次正式会谈。
    在艾森豪威尔政府上台后不久，新国务卿杜勒斯就在今年二月初到西欧各国巡视。杜勒斯对西欧各国政府公开施加粗暴的压力，催促它们加紧扩张军备，特别是从速建立以西德法西斯军队为核心的“欧洲军”。杜勒斯并且给迟迟没有批准“欧洲军”条约的西欧各国规定了必须在四月里批准这个条约的期限。杜勒斯到处以最后通牒式的口吻威胁西欧统治集团说，如果不照美国的命令办事，美国就不再给他们以美元。但是，美国报纸不得不承认，美国的新压力激起了西欧各国广泛阶层的愤慨，使美国与西欧间的关系达到了空前未有的紧张程度。
    艾森豪威尔政府于是决定与西欧各国政府举行正式会谈。美国政府企图通过这一连串会谈，来迫使西欧接受美国的要求，来缓和相互间的紧张关系。美国政府期望这些会谈能为定于四月二十三日在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议奠定基础，使美国的西欧扩军计划能在这个会议上获得“决定性的进展”。现在，这一连串会谈已经告一段落了，美国并没有能达到它的目的。
    在华盛顿的这些会谈中，关于欧洲问题的议程，主要讨论了二个问题。一个是以重新武装西德为中心的“欧洲军”计划问题。一个是扩张军备在西欧所引起的经济危机问题。
    在“欧洲军”问题上，似乎唯一能使美国感到满意的是它与西德总理阿登纳的会谈。阿登纳在会谈前就强使西德联邦议院匆匆批准了“欧洲军”条约。在会谈中，双方达成了加紧组织西德武装部队的协议。阿登纳在一到美国后就公开对新闻记者宣称他“愿意开诚地接受美国所提出的任何意见”，美国要与这样的人达成协议，自然是不大困难的。然而，这种协议并没有解决美国所面临的问题。因为，阿登纳的态度丝毫也不能代表西德广大人民群众以及很大一部分资产阶级的态度，他们正在日益坚决地要求统一德国，反对加深德国分裂的“欧洲军”计划。
    美国与阿登纳的协议，明显地反映出美国要扶植西德军国主义者作为美国统治西欧的宪兵的政策。这种威胁到西欧各国切身利益的政策，不仅不能使西欧在美国指挥下真正“统一”起来，而且在加深着美国与西欧间以及西欧内部的矛盾。在美法会谈中，尽管美国方面采取“强硬”政策，要求法国设法从速批准“欧洲军”条约，法国方面仍避免对美国提供确切的保证，而坚持在批准“欧洲军”条约前要解决萨尔问题。法国统治者对美国的“欧洲军”计划是卖了力气的，但是他们在接受美国命令时已不得不采取某种保留态度，这是由于他们不能不看到：在法国国内，不仅是广大人民，而且许多资产阶级人士，甚至军队中的一些高级军官，都反对
    “欧洲军”条约。西德军国主义的复活使法国资产阶级惴惴不安，其中一些比较清醒的代表已公开主张通过美、苏、英、法四国谈判来讨论统一德国问题，以避免建立“欧洲军”的危险。
    至于英国，华盛顿会谈也没有能使它的态度有所改变。英国政府仍拒绝参加“欧洲军”。
    华盛顿一连串的会谈并没有能使美国的“欧洲军”计划脱离摇摇欲坠的危境。美国通讯社承认，这个计划仍旧处在“最艰难的阶段”。
    美国的企图在美英、美法会谈中是落了空。而英国及法国对华盛顿会谈的期望也得到了失望的答复。
    英国政府在华盛顿会议中感到兴趣的主要问题是经济问题。扩张军备以及美国在资本主义世界市场上的排挤，已使主要依赖对外贸易为生的英国入超现象严重，去年全年贸易逆差达七亿八千八百万英镑。为了挽救这种危险的局面，英国在会谈中要求美国减低阻止英国货进入美国的关税壁垒，要求美国提高收购英镑区黄金的价格，要求美国提高收购英镑区原料的价格，要求美国拿出几十亿美元来作为稳定正在不断跌落的英镑价值的基金。但是，美国在会谈中拒绝具体地讨论这些要求。
    扩张军备及侵略越南战争也使法国的财政濒于破产，法国今年预算赤字已达八千二百多亿法郎的天文数字。在美法会谈之前，法国报纸即透露，法国政府企图在会谈中要求美国给予十亿美元“援助”，作为侵越战争的战费，以弥补法国财政上的赤字。但是，法国也没有从会谈中得到具体结果。
    美英、美法会谈的结果，没有能使任何一部分英国和法国社会人士感到满意。英国“泰晤士报”说，美英会谈“缺乏积极结果”已在英国引起“失望”。对美法会谈，所有法国报纸都没有作积极的评论。
