Editor's Note: This is an abstract of the editorial from the eleventh issue of "Heavy Industry Communications," which analyzes the serious situation of waste and irresponsibility in construction, proposes the establishment of dedicated responsibility systems, and outlines the steps for launching a struggle against waste and irresponsibility. Many construction units are currently engaged in the struggle against waste and irresponsibility, and this editorial can serve as a reference for everyone.

After inspecting the basic construction work of 1952, the Ministry of Heavy Industry pointed out that waste and irresponsibility were particularly serious in basic construction. These wasteful phenomena are manifested in all aspects: waste caused by rework due to poor quality and quality accidents; waste caused by stockpiling of equipment and materials; waste caused by failure to complete projects on schedule and long-term stockpiling of state funds; various wastes during construction, such as waste of building materials, waste of labor, waste in transportation, waste of construction machinery, and waste in management fees. This serious waste has caused significant losses to the country and brought catastrophic disasters to basic construction! The reasons for these wasteful phenomena, in addition to poor planning and design errors, are mainly due to the serious irresponsibility and unwillingness to take responsibility within the construction departments. For example, unsound organizations, unclear responsibilities, and no one specifically responsible for many administrative affairs. No one supervises or inspects the monthly construction plan, and no one is responsible for many quality errors. There are no technical operating procedures on the construction site, or even if there are, workers do not follow them, and no one is responsible for inspection. There are also many chaotic phenomena in the procurement, storage, acceptance, and distribution of equipment and materials. In terms of cost and financial management, many units have no engineering design budget before construction and no project final account long after construction is completed, and they are extremely irresponsible in the use of state investment.

In order to overcome construction waste and establish a responsibility system, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has determined that all construction units of heavy industry departments should launch a struggle against waste and irresponsibility in April and May, mobilize the masses to expose waste and irresponsibility, and establish a responsibility system for basic construction. Some comrades believe that the main problem in basic construction is not waste, let alone irresponsibility. They do not understand that if a struggle against waste is not carried out among all employees of the construction department and various responsibility systems are not established, then the basic construction department cannot carry out construction in an orderly manner. They do not understand that the responsibility system is one of the basic organizational principles of a complex construction department. If the responsibility system is not established, the chaotic state of the construction site can never be overcome, and therefore it will not be possible to guarantee that the project is completed according to the requirements of "good, fast, and economical" to fulfill the national plan.

In order to enable this mass movement to be carried out in depth, it must be explained to all cadres that this mass movement is not to punish anyone or to get rid of anyone; the main purpose is to expose the serious shortcomings and errors in our work through mass criticism and self-criticism, thereby educating the masses and improving leadership, gaining experience from practical work to improve work, and achieving the establishment of a responsibility system for basic construction departments, so that someone is responsible for doing any job well or poorly. Some comrades believe that after this movement, it is enough to strengthen the concept of economic accounting among the masses and cadres, and whether or not to implement the responsibility system is secondary. These comrades have forgotten the main purpose of this movement. They do not understand that if the responsibility system cannot be well established, then the results of the struggle against waste cannot be guaranteed organizationally, and economic accounting work will not be easy to carry out.

Based on the inspection of basic construction work in 1952, this year we require construction departments to establish the following responsibility systems: (1) Establish an administrative responsibility system. A work area is headed by the site director who is responsible for the construction leadership of the entire site, and a work section is headed by the foreman who is responsible for the construction leadership of the entire work section; all administrative work is handled by dedicated personnel; establish and improve various construction management organizations (such as planning, construction, equipment, materials, technical inspection, cost accounting, labor wages, personnel, safety, etc.), and clearly define the responsibilities of each organization. (2) Establish and improve the construction responsibility system, formulate necessary construction operation plans, and establish a dispatching organization, designating dedicated personnel to be responsible for supervising the implementation of the construction plan.

(3) Establish various responsibility systems for technical supply work. There should be a set of responsibility systems from procurement, acceptance, warehousing, accounting, material requisition, and material return. (4) Establish and improve the technical responsibility system. Any work area should have a chief engineer (or general engineer), and any project should have dedicated technical personnel, so that technical matters are handled by dedicated personnel; establish an independent technical inspection organization to supervise whether the construction department is carrying out construction according to the prescribed quality standards; establish a mass-based quality responsibility system, such as "self-inspection system," "nameplate system," "shift handover system," and "mutual inspection system between upper and lower processes," so that when any project quality error occurs, it can be found who is responsible, and the lessons learned can be summarized. (5) Through anti-waste efforts, establish relevant economic accounting responsibility systems, such as improving grassroots financial accounting organizations; supervising financial appropriations based on design budgets and contracted projects; establishing a cost accounting system; and preparing project final accounts on schedule. These responsibility systems must be discussed by the masses. Only when all cadres and employees establish a responsibility system concept and establish necessary responsibility systems, and then continuously inspect, supplement, and revise them in future practical work, will it bring a new look to construction enterprises and gradually overcome various phenomena of irresponsibility.

Based on the experience of the responsibility system movement in Northeast China in 1952, in this mass movement against waste and irresponsibility, there must be certain work steps. The general provisions are as follows: First step: The leading cadres of each basic construction department should make a general analysis and inspection of the main wasteful phenomena and the main irresponsible phenomena that exist in the construction in 1952 and in the basic construction preparation work in 1953, find out the reasons, and propose the future work direction. Second step: Mobilize the masses (especially technical and management personnel) to expose the wasteful phenomena and irresponsible phenomena that exist in our work, and analyze the causes. Third step: Based on the exposed problems, discuss and study the establishment of various responsibility systems from top to bottom and from bottom to top in a prepared and planned manner. Last year, many construction departments in Northeast China only paid attention to the first two steps, so it "boomed" for a while and then passed, and many responsibility systems were not established. Therefore, we must do a good job in the third step this year. However, some comrades believe that there is no need to do the first two steps, just formulate some systems and take them to the masses for discussion; this approach is also wrong. Newly established basic construction departments and construction departments this year should also launch this struggle. The steps and methods are: First, conduct education for all employees against waste and irresponsibility, and conduct inspection and discussion in connection with the current actual situation, and then mobilize all employees to formulate various responsibility systems and implement them.

Each basic construction department must act immediately, strengthen political work, rely on the broad masses of employees, and carry out the struggle against waste and irresponsibility in depth to ensure the full completion of the 1953 basic construction plan.

### 正确地开展反对浪费和反对无人负责现象的斗争——“重工业通讯”第十一期社论摘要

    正确地开展反对浪费和反对无人负责现象的斗争
    ——“重工业通讯”第十一期社论摘要
    编者按：这是重工业通讯第十一期的社论摘要，其中分析了施工中浪费及无人负责现象的严重情况，提出了应该建立那些专责制度，以及展开反对浪费和无人负责现象斗争的步骤。目前很多施工单位都在进行反浪费和反无人负责现象的斗争，这篇社论可作大家的参考。
    重工业部在检查了一九五二年的基本建设工作后，指出了浪费与无人负责现象在基本建设中特别严重。这些浪费现象表现在各方面：质量低劣和质量事故所造成的返工的浪费；设备、材料积压所造成的浪费；不能按期竣工、长期积压国家资金所造成的浪费；施工当中的各种浪费，如建筑材料浪费、劳动力浪费、运输上的浪费、施工机械的浪费、管理费上的浪费等。这种严重的浪费现象，给国家造成了重大损失，给基本建设带来了奇灾大祸！产生这些浪费现象的原因，除了计划不周、设计错误外，最主要的是由于施工部门存在着严重的无人负责与不愿负责现象。如机构不健全、职责不明、许多行政事务没有专人负责。每月施工计划完成得如何没有人监督检查，发生许多质量错误无人负责。施工现场没有技术操作规程，或有了操作规程，工人不遵守，也无人负责检查。设备材料的采购、保管、验收、分发工作，也存在着许多混乱现象。在成本财务管理上，不少单位在施工前既无工程设计预算，施工完成后很久又无工程决算，对国家投资的使用极端不负责。
    为了克服施工浪费及建立责任制，重工业部确定所有重工业部门的施工单位在四、五月份应展开一个反浪费反对无人负责现象的斗争，发动群众揭露浪费现象及无人负责现象，建立基本建设的责任制。有些同志认为目前基本建设中主要问题不是浪费，更不是无人负责。他们不了解，如不在施工部门全体职工中进行反浪费斗争与建立起各种责任制度，则基本建设部门就不可能有秩序地进行施工。他们不了解，责任制是复杂的施工部门的基本组织原则之一，如果不建立责任制，施工现场的混乱状况永远无法克服，因而也就不可能保证工程按着“好、快、省”的要求来完成国家计划。
    为了使这一群众运动能深入地开展，在全体干部中必须说明，这次群众运动不是要惩办哪些人，或整掉哪些人；主要是要经过群众性的批评与自我批评，揭露我们工作中的严重缺点和错误，借以教育群众与提高领导，从实际工作中取得经验改进工作，达到建立基本建设部门的责任制，使任何一件工作办好办坏，都有专人负责。有些同志认为经过这一运动只要加强了群众及干部的经济核算观念就可以了，责任制搞不搞是次要的。这些同志竟忘掉了这个运动的主要目的，他们不了解如果责任制不能很好地建立起来，则反浪费斗争的成果就不可能得到组织上的保证，经济核算工作也就不好进行。
    根据对一九五二年基本建设工作的检查，在今年我们要求施工部门建立以下几种责任制度：（1）建立行政上的专责制。一个工区由工地主任负责全工地的施工领导，一个工段由工长负责全工段的施工领导；一切行政工作，都有专人负责；建立与健全各种施工管理机构（如计划、施工、设备、材料、技术检查、成本会计、劳动工资、人事、安全等），并明确规定各个组织的职责。（2）建立与健全施工的责任制度，制订必要的施工作业计划，并建立调度机构，指定专人负责监督施工计划的执行。
    （3）建立技术供应工作的各种责任制，从采购、验收、入库、记帐、领料、退料，都应有一套责任制度。（4）建立与健全技术责任制。任何一个工区都应有主任工程师（或总工程师），任何一项工程都应有专责技术人员，以便技术上有专人负责；建立独立的技术检查机构，监督施工部门是否按规定的质量标准进行施工；建立群众性的质量责任制，如“自我检查制”、“挂牌制”、“交接班制”、
    “上下工序互检制”等，使任何一项工程质量发生错误时，都能找到谁负责任，并总结出其中的经验教训。（5）通过反浪费，建立有关的经济核算的责任制，如健全基层财务会计组织；根据设计预算、包工合同监督财政拨款；建立成本会计制度；按期作出工程决算等。这些责任制必须经过群众讨论，只有全体干部及全体职工树立了责任制观念，并建立了必要的责任制度，在今后的实际工作中再不断地加以检查、补充、修正，它就会给建筑企业带来新的面貌，就会逐渐克服各种无人负责现象。
    根据一九五二年东北地区建立责任制运动的经验，在这次反浪费反无人负责现象的群众运动中，必须要有一定的工作步骤。大体规定如下：第一步：由各基本建设部门的领导干部，对一九五二年施工当中及一九五三年基本建设施工准备工作当中存在的最主要的浪费现象，及最主要的无人负责现象，加以概括的分析与检查，找出原因，并提出今后的工作方向。第二步：发动群众（特别要发动技术人员与管理人员）揭露我们工作中所存在的浪费现象与无人负责现象，并分析产生的原因。第三步：根据暴露出的问题，有准备、有计划地自上而下地、自下而上地讨论与研究建立各种责任制。去年东北地区许多施工部门只注意了前两个步骤，因此“轰”一阵就过去了，许多责任制度并没有建立起来，因此今年一定要把第三步工作作好。但也有些同志认为不需要再作前两步工作，只订立些制度，拿到群众中去讨论一下就可以了；这样作法也同样是错误的。今年新成立的基本建设部门和施工部门，也同样应展开这一斗争，其步骤与方法是：首先向全体职工进行反对浪费反对无人负责的教育，并联系当前实际情况进行检查与讨论，然后再发动全体职工制订各种责任制，并加以贯彻执行。
    各个基本建设部门必须立即行动起来，加强政治工作，依靠广大职工群众，深入开展反对浪费反对无人负责现象的斗争，以保证一九五三年基本建设计划的全部完成。
