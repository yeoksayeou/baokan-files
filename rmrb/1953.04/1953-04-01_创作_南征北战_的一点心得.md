Some Experiences in Creating "South Conquest, North War"
Shen Mojun

    The screenplay "South Conquest, North War" is a collective creation. The idea for this creation was conceived after entering the city. The great victory of the national liberation aroused infinite memories in us. We recalled many heroes who shed blood and sacrificed for the revolutionary cause, and we recalled the people of Shandong. In the most difficult years of the war, the people supported the army with their greatest efforts, and the army responded to the people with their greatest victories. These heroic figures and their inspiring and moving heroic deeds deeply moved, educated, and encouraged us. We felt it was our responsibility to sing their praises, to sing their great contributions to the revolution, and to sing their heroic fighting spirit. This was the first part, and also the main content, that we intended to express in the screenplay at that time.

    Secondly, we also deeply realized in the war that the war moved from difficulty to victory because our troops faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's strategic policies. However, in the early stages of the war, many people did not understand this great truth. Only after experiencing complex struggles and the reality of the war did they gradually understand the correctness, greatness, and brilliance of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. We felt it was our responsibility and also necessary to sing the praises of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. This was the second part of the content we intended to express in the screenplay at that time.

    Based on the above two aspects of content, we established the theme, considered the characters, and structured the story. Because our understanding of the creative methods of socialist realism was not deep enough, the work did not proceed smoothly. First of all, the theme was vague. We only vaguely determined the theme of the screenplay as: Guns plus millet (military-civilian cooperation), implementing Chairman Mao's strategic policy of mobile warfare, defeating the American-Chiang bandits, and winning the victory of the war. As for whether to focus on expressing the nature of the people's war, or to focus on expressing Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, it was not clear enough. We simply believed that the two were inseparable. When writing the screenplay, we were more inclined to express the nature of the people's war, because we were more familiar with this aspect of life. As for the issue of strategic thinking, although we had some understanding, it was not very profound after all, and we couldn't grasp it when we encountered specific problems. We felt that we were not yet capable of writing about strategic thinking.

    The vagueness and lack of clarity of the theme inevitably affected the conception of other aspects. When considering the characters, we planned to focus on describing several characters (such as Battalion Commander Gao, Company Commander Zhang, Zhao Yumin, etc.), and reflect the victory and development of the war through their growth and development; and express the noble qualities and revolutionary heroism of our people's army through the victory and development of the war. However, we did not fully achieve this goal. When structuring the story, we initially attempted to include all the major battles of the East China battlefield in the past three years in the screenplay, starting from Chairman Mao's trip to Chongqing for peace talks, Chiang Kai-shek's tearing up of the negotiation agreement, and launching a civil war, attacking the liberated areas, writing about the retreat to Shandong after the seven battles and seven victories in Northern Jiangsu, the retreat to Southern Shandong (with the Laiwu Campaign as the background), the enemy's key offensive (with the Menglianggu Campaign as the background), the transformation of our army from weak to strong (with the external offensive as the background), and finally writing about the great leap forward (with the Huaihai Campaign as the background). And use three lines of struggle against the enemy to run through the entire story, one is the main force, one is the armed forces behind enemy lines, and one is underground work. The struggle against the enemy on these three fronts must be organically combined. It is necessary to highlight the struggle against the enemy by the main force on the front, while at the same time not weakening the role of the struggle against the enemy behind enemy lines and underground. On this point, we really put in a lot of effort.

    The screenplay includes so much content because we have the problem of "greedy for more and seeking completeness" and the lack of artistic generalization ability. We are not good at concentrating the real struggle on a few points to develop, that is, we do not understand how to create a typical environment. Although we wrote many events, it is difficult to express the essence of each event clearly. We mechanically believe that these battles are prominent events on the East China battlefield, and the development of the war can only be shown through these events; the characters must go through these events to show their growth and development. In fact, the development of a character does not necessarily require writing out the entire process of the event to show it. If the character's personality and development are focused on several major fighting events, it will give people a deeper impression. Matrosov in the movie "Ordinary Soldier" is a successful example. Why should we arrange the struggle on three fronts? Because we mechanically believe that it would violate the historical truth if we didn't describe it this way. We don't understand that artistic creation should be different from general work summaries, and we don't understand that such a comprehensive description will inevitably be incomplete in every aspect.

    The inevitable shortcomings of the first draft are: complex content, too many clues, and unclear theme. After review by the superiors, we carried out a second revision (in addition to the major deletions and revisions of the plot, the theme remained the same). Finally, it was sent to Commander Chen Yi for review.

    Commander Chen Yi squeezed time out of his busy schedule to review our screenplay and summoned us for a discussion. At the symposium, he instructed that the theme of the screenplay should boldly express Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of mobile warfare - that is, a big step forward, a big step backward, not focusing on the gains and losses of one city or one place, but focusing on striving to annihilate the enemy's effective strength in large numbers. Through the story of specific military struggles, the strategic thinking of Chairman Mao's mobile warfare is expressed, which not only has historical value, but also has practical significance. In terms of story structure, he instructed that we should start from the retreat from Southern Shandong and write until the Laiwu Campaign. Only in this way can it be expressed deeply. Don't write everything, and don't write everything deeply. He also told about the basic situation of the enemy and us before and after the Laiwu Campaign. In terms of expression methods, he instructed that there are two methods, one is to describe historical facts positively, and the other is to use the method of fictional stories. In terms of characters, he instructed that we should focus on writing a few characters. In order to deeply express the contradictory struggle of the real life at that time, we can arrange a character who does not understand the idea of mobile warfare, which leads to loss of confidence, pessimism and disappointment; and even develops to defecting to the enemy. He cited Fadayev's novel "The Rout" as an example to illustrate that such a description is vivid and powerful. He also talked about the issue of language. He instructed that we should not write our soldiers as characters who only speak local dialects and vulgar and obscene words. Finally, he talked about some other issues that must be paid attention to. For example: the expression of the enemy should also adopt realistic methods. If the enemy is tenacious, it should not be written as vulnerable. The enemy should also have a personality. He used many examples to induce us to master the correct creative methods.

    Under the support and guidance of Commander Chen Yi, the supervision and guidance of the comrades of the General Political Department of the Military Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, especially the specific leadership and help of Comrade Wu Qiang, the former deputy director of the Cultural Department of the Third Field Army, the creation of "South Conquest, North War" basically completed its task. The support and help of the leadership is an important key to the creation of the screenplay.

    In the process of continuous revision, we encountered some specific problems.

    The first is the issue of writing internal contradictions and struggles. The superiors once instructed us to write a character who did not understand the idea of mobile warfare and lost confidence, pessimism, and even developed to defecting to the enemy; we also felt at the time that there should be such a character, so that the contradictions and struggles raised in the play can be deeply unfolded, but this character is difficult to deal with. It is not okay to write him as a company commander; it is not okay to write him as a platoon leader; finally, it was decided to write this character as a soldier (Wang Chun in the current film). But we didn't dare to write that he lost confidence and was pessimistic because he didn't understand the idea of mobile warfare, and we didn't dare to write that he defected to the enemy. We only wrote that he didn't understand the idea of mobile warfare because his vision was narrow and he only saw temporary interests and not long-term interests. He was not satisfied with the big step backward, so when the troops retreated to Taocun, he deserted and stayed in the local guerrilla team. His purpose of desertion was also to protect the land and his family, not to be greedy for life and afraid of death. However, after the screenplay was written, some comrades believed that this treatment exposed a big weakness in our political work, and even allowed the wrong thinking of such a soldier to develop to desertion. This is contrary to reality. In the absence of other better methods, this soldier was written as not deserting.

    Why didn't we dare to write such a completely negated rebellious and enemy-defected character? Mainly because we don't feel life deeply, we lack keen observation and analysis ability for the various complex contradictions existing in reality, and we lack the ability of artistic generalization. At the same time, we did not truly understand and master the method of socialist realism to create a typical image. In the early stage of the war, some people did not understand the idea of mobile warfare, which is a fact, but losing confidence, pessimism, and even defecting to the enemy because of this is an individual phenomenon, not a universal phenomenon, so it cannot become a typical example. At that time, we did not understand that "the conscious exaggeration and prominent depiction of an image does not exclude typicality, but rather more fully excavates it and emphasizes it" (Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union). We just didn't consciously and prominently portray this negative typical character, and simplified the ideological struggle process of getting through the idea of mobile warfare, so it seemed not real enough.

    Secondly, about dealing with the sacrifice of heroic characters. There was originally a scene at the end of the screenplay, which was written like this: Battalion Commander Gao was ordered to insert behind enemy lines. The task was to close the enemy's retreating gate and wait for the main force to come and annihilate all the enemies entrenched in Taocun. The enemy attacked the station position of Gao Ying with powerful artillery fire, trying to escape south. When the enemy's armored vehicle of the breakout force broke through the forward position and penetrated into the station center battalion command post, Battalion Commander Gao was injured, and Company Commander Zhang was also seriously injured. In a very critical situation, Company Commander Zhang picked up a bag of explosives and jumped from the top of the bunker several feet high towards the enemy's armored vehicle. Due to his heroic sacrifice, the enemy's breakout was stopped and the victory of the battle was accelerated. Some comrades believed that Company Commander Zhang was one of the main characters and should not be sacrificed. We also thought this opinion was correct at the time, but we also considered that it didn't seem very real if there were no sacrifices and bloodshed in the war, and according to the situation at the time, there had to be some sacrifices, so what should we do? Later, it was changed to the soldier Wang Chun being sacrificed. But some comrades thought again that Wang Chun didn't understand the idea of mobile warfare at first, and he sacrificed as soon as he understood it, which is very regrettable. When we heard this, we also thought it made sense, so we changed it to a less important character, squad leader Chen Dehai, being sacrificed. Later, it was probably changed by the director again, and it was changed to the soldier Li Jin being sacrificed. It is said that when the director was shooting this scene, he shot a scene of death, and also shot a scene of not death, saying it was "just in case." When I heard about this, I praised it greatly: "Foresight!" Later, after review, it was indeed as expected, Li Jin should not die. If it weren't for "being prepared", it would indeed cost people and money to make up the shots. After this study, I corrected my incorrect view.

    Why did we shrink back and couldn't make up our minds when dealing with the sacrifice of this character? This is mainly because we did not analyze and study the environment in which the characters in the play were in at that time, and did not really consider the authenticity of artistic life from the actual situation, so the east wind came with the east wind, and the west wind came with the west wind.

    Again, there is the issue of writing love. We originally planned to express his connection with the masses through the relationship between Battalion Commander Gao and Zhao Yumin and Zhao Da Niang, but the result did not realize this attempt. Looking at the historical relationship of the characters (Battalion Commander Gao had been raised his gun wound in Zhao Yumin's house during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Zhao Yumin and her mother had saved his life, and in this process, Battalion Commander Gao also taught her to read and told her the truth every day.) As it develops, it is possible for them to have a love relationship. It is not necessarily to "add some moisture" and deliberately create a love entanglement. In the initial screenplay, we treated the relationship between these two characters a little more clearly than the current screenplay. Later, some people thought it was inappropriate, and we ourselves felt that in the difficult situation of the war, how could a soldier be in love with a local female comrade? But it seemed to be needed according to the development of the characters, so in the case of undecided choice, it was changed to the kind of ambiguous relationship in the current screenplay.

    Finally, there is the issue of the authenticity of the description, the historical specificity, and the revolutionary optimism. Although the scene of retreating from Taocun that we described also expressed the heavy mood of the soldiers and residents, it was not deep and powerful enough. According to the historical truth, when the soldiers and the people did not understand the idea of mobile warfare, and the troops won the battle and then retreated greatly, the emotions they revealed were much stronger and more complex than what we described in the screenplay. Through this national film screenplay creation conference, I have initially realized that only a truthful description can express the historical specificity. It does not contradict revolutionary optimism, because people's thoughts and feelings are complex, and there is a process from low to high. In this process, there are many contradictions and struggles. The certain emotions and changes revealed by the characters in a certain struggle environment are in line with the law of human ideological development. If the soldiers and the people were indifferent when the troops retreated from Taocun (or a perfunctory expression, or a smile), it would not only fail to express the spirit of revolutionary optimism, but on the contrary, it would violate the authenticity of the description and the historical specificity, and vulgarize the spirit of revolutionary optimism.

    This is the first time we have written a film screenplay, especially the first time we have written a film screenplay with strategic thinking as the theme. Although we have received support and help from the leadership, due to the limitations of our ideological and artistic level, there are still some shortcomings in this screenplay. Some people say that "South Conquest, North War" is a "diagram" of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of mobile warfare. I understand the spirit of this criticism, which mainly refers to our screenplay's failure to fully unfold the contradictions and struggles that should be unfolded, that is, the contradictions and struggles between Zhang Lianchang, Wang Chun, Zhao Yumin, Liu Yonggui's wife and others from not understanding the idea of mobile warfare to understanding it have not been fully unfolded; the positive characters who give people a deep impression spiritually have not been artistically and movingly portrayed; no heroic and typical figures worthy of being role models for people have been created. After this study, I did discover many vague understandings in my past creative thinking and creative methods. Of course, today's understanding is still superficial. In the future, we should further study the creative methods of socialist realism, and gradually improve our understanding and creative ability in continuous creative practice. (The above are all the author's personal opinions and have not been discussed with the other two screenwriters of the film, Shen Ximeng and Gu Baozhang.

    创作“南征北战”的一点心得
    沈默君
    电影剧本“南征北战”是集体创作。酝酿这一创作的时候是在入城以后。全国解放的伟大胜利，引起了我们无限回忆。我们回忆起战斗中许多为革命事业流血牺牲的英雄，回忆起山东的人民。在战争最艰难的年月里，人民以最大的努力来支援军队，军队以最大的胜利来回答人民。这些英雄人物以及他们所创造出来的可歌可泣的英勇事迹，深深地感动了我们，教育了我们，鼓舞了我们。我们感到有责任来歌颂他们，歌颂他们对革命的伟大贡献，歌颂他们英勇的斗争精神，这是当时我们打算在剧本里所要表现的第一部分，也是主要内容。
    其次，在战争中我们也深切地体会到，战争由困难走向胜利，是由于我们的部队忠实地执行了毛主席的战略方针。但在战争初期，不少人是不了解这一伟大的真理的，只是在经过了复杂的斗争，经过了战争的实际，才逐步了解到毛主席的战略思想的正确、伟大和英明。我们感到有责任、也有必要来歌颂毛主席的战略思想。这是当时我们打算在剧本中表现的第二部分内容。
    根据以上两方面的内容，我们便确立主题，思考人物，结构故事。由于我们对社会主义现实主义的创作方法理解不深，工作进行得十分不顺利。首先是主题含糊，我们只笼统地确定剧本主题为：枪杆加小米（军民合作），执行了毛主席的运动战的战略方针，打败了美蒋匪帮，获得了战争胜利。至于着重表现人民战争的性质呢，还是着重表现毛主席的战略思想呢，则不够明确，只是简单地认为两者不可分割。在拟写剧本时，我们又比较偏重于表现人民战争的性质，原因是我们对这一方面的生活比较熟悉。而对战略思想问题，我们虽有所体会，但究竟很不深刻，接触到具体问题时，就把握不住。我们觉得自己还没有能力写战略思想。
    主题含糊、不明确，必然会影响其他方面的构思。在思考人物时，我们打算集中描写几个人物（如高营长、张连长、赵玉敏等），通过他们的成长和发展来反映战争的胜利和发展；通过战争的胜利和发展来表现我们人民军队的高尚品质和革命英雄主义，但我们并没有完全达到这一目的。结构故事时，一开始就企图把华东战场三年来的重大战役都包括在剧本里，从毛主席到重庆和平谈判、蒋介石撕毁谈判协定、发动内战，向解放区进攻写起，写到苏北七战七捷后向山东撤退，撤退鲁南（以莱芜战役为背景），经过敌人重点进攻（以孟良崮战役为背景），我军转弱为强（以外线出击为背景），最后写到大踏步前进（以淮海大战为背景）为止。并且以三条战线的对敌斗争来贯串整个故事，一条是主力部队，一条是敌后武装，一条是地下工作。这三条战线的对敌斗争要有机的结合，既要突出正面主力部队的对敌斗争，同时又不能削弱敌后和地下的对敌斗争的作用。在这一点上，我们确实煞费苦心。
    剧本内容包括得这样多，是因为我们存在着“贪多求全”和艺术概括能力不强的毛病，不善于把现实斗争集中在几点上来加以发挥，也就是不懂得创造典型环境。我们虽然写了许多事件，但很难将每个事件的本质表现得很清楚。我们机械地认为，这些战役都是华东战场上突出的事件，必须经过这些事件才能显示出战争的发展；人物必须经过这些事件才能显示出他的成长和发展。其实，人物的发展，不一定非要写出事件的全部过程才能显示出来。如果在几件主要的斗争事件上集中描写人物的性格和发展，反而更会给人以深刻的印象。“普通一兵”影片中的马特洛索夫，就是一个成功的例子。我们为什么要安排三条战线的斗争呢？因为我们机械地认为，如果不这样描写就违反了历史的真实。不懂得艺术创造应该区别于一般的工作总结，不懂得这样面面俱到的描写，势必面面不周全。
    初稿的毛病就不可避免地是：内容庞杂，头绪太多，主题不明确。经上级审查后，我们进行了二次修改（除了情节上的大删改外，主题仍然照旧）。最后送请陈毅司令员审查。
    陈毅司令员在百忙中挤出时间来审查我们的剧本，并召见我们和我们进行座谈。在座谈会上，他指示：剧本的主题应大胆表现毛主席的运动战的战略思想——即大踏步前进、大踏步后退，不在一城一地的得失，而以争取大量歼灭敌人有生力量为主的作战方针。通过具体的军事斗争的故事，表现出毛主席的运动战的战略思想，它不仅有历史价值，而且有现实意义。故事结构上，他指示说，就从鲁南撤退写起，写到莱芜战役为止，只有这样，才可能表现得深刻，不要什么都写，什么都写得不深刻。他还讲述了莱芜战役前后的敌我的基本情况。表现方法上，他指示说，可以有两种方法，一种是正面描写历史事实，一种是采用虚构故事的方法。在人物上，他指示说，要集中写几个人物，为了深刻表现当时现实生活的矛盾斗争，可以安排一个人物对运动战思想搞不通，以致丧失信心，悲观失望；甚至发展到投敌叛变。他举了法捷耶夫的小说“毁灭”中的美谛克为例，来说明那样描写是生动有力的。他还谈到语言的问题，他指示说，不要把我们的兵士写成专讲土语、庸俗下流的话的人物。最后，他谈到另外一些必须注意的问题。例如：表现敌人也应该采取现实主义的方法，如果敌人是顽强的，也就不应该写得它不堪一击，敌人也应是有性格的。他用了许多例证来诱导我们掌握住正确的创作方法。
    在陈毅司令员的扶植、指导下，在中国人民解放军军委总政治部文化部的同志的督促和指导下，特别是三野文化部前副部长吴强同志的具体领导和帮助下，“南征北战”的创作才基本上完成了任务。领导上的扶植和帮助，是剧本创作的一个重要关键。
    在不断修改过程中，我们遇到了一些具体问题。
    首先是写内部矛盾和斗争问题。上级曾指示我们写一个人物对运动战思想搞不通而丧失信心，悲观失望，甚至发展到投敌叛变；我们当时也觉得应该出现这么一个人物，这样才能深刻展开剧中提出的矛盾和斗争，但这个人物很难处理。把他写成连长吧，不行；写成排长吧，也不行；最后决定把这个人物写成战士（现在影片中的王春）。但我们也不敢写他因对运动战思想搞不通而丧失信心、悲观失望，更不敢写他投敌叛变，仅仅写他对运动战思想搞不通是由于眼光狭小，只看到暂时的利益而看不到长远的利益。他不满意大踏步后退，所以当部队撤退桃村时，他开了小差，留在当地干游击队。他开小差的目的也是为了保田保家，而不是贪生怕死。但剧本写好后，有的同志认为这样处理，是暴露了我们政治工作一个很大的弱点，竟让这样一个战士的错误思想发展到开小差。这是违反现实的。在想不出其他更好办法的情况下，便把这个战士写成不开小差了。
    我们为什么不敢写那样一个完全被否定的叛变投敌的人物呢？主要由于我们对生活感受得不深，对现实中存在着的各种复杂的矛盾，缺乏敏锐的观察和分析能力，缺乏艺术的概括能力。同时我们没有真正了解和掌握社会主义现实主义的方法来创造典型。在战争初期，有一部分人对运动战思想搞不通，这是事实，但因此而丧失信心，悲观失望，以致投敌叛变，究竟是个别现象，不是普遍现象，因此不能成为典型。当时我们不懂得“有意识的夸张和突出地刻划一个形象并不排斥典型性，而是更加充分地发掘它和强调它”（马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告）。我们恰恰是没有有意识地突出地刻划这一个反面的典型人物，把搞通运动战的思想斗争过程简单化了，因此就显得不够真实。
    其次，关于处理英雄人物的牺牲问题。剧本最后有一场戏，原先是这样写的：高营长奉命插入敌后，任务是关死敌人后退的大门，等候大部队赶来聚歼踞守桃村的全部敌人。敌人以强大炮火攻击高营之车站阵地，企图南逃，当敌人突围部队的铁甲车突破前沿阵地，深入到车站中心营指挥所时，高营长负伤，张连长也负重伤，在万分危急的情况下，张连长抱起一包炸药，从数丈高的碉堡顶迎着敌人的铁甲车跳下来，由于他的壮烈牺牲，阻止住了敌人的突围，加速了战斗胜利的到来。有的同志认为，张连长是主要人物之一，不应当牺牲。我们当时也认为这意见正确，但又考虑到，打仗没有牺牲流血似乎不太真实，按当时的情况也不能不有所牺牲，怎么办呢？以后便改为战士王春牺牲了。但又有同志认为，王春最初对运动战思想搞不通，刚一搞通就牺牲了，十分令人惋惜。我们一听，也满有道理，于是就改成一个不大重要的人物，班长陈德海牺牲。后来大概是导演又改了一下，改成了战士李进牺牲了。据说，导演在拍摄这场戏时，拍了一个死的镜头，同时又拍了一个不死的镜头，说是“以防万一”。我听到此事，大为赞扬：“有远见！”后来经过审查，果然不出所料，是要李进不死。如不是“早有准备”，那的确要劳民伤财，去补镜头了。经过这次学习，才纠正了我这种不正确的观点。
    我们处理这一个人物的牺牲，为什么会缩手缩脚，拿不定主意呢？这主要因为我们没有很好分析研究剧中人物当时所处的环境，没有真正从实际出发来考虑作为艺术生命的真实性问题，所以东风来随东风，西风来随西风。
    再次，是写爱情的问题。我们原先是打算通过高营长和赵玉敏、赵大娘的关系，来表现他和群众的联系，但结果没有实现这个企图。按人物的历史关系来看（高营长在抗战时曾在赵玉敏家养过枪伤，赵玉敏和他母亲曾救活了他的生命，在这过程中，高营长又天天教她认字，讲道理给她听。）发展下去，他们有恋爱关系是可能的，倒不一定是为了“增加点水份”，故意捏弄出一段恋爱纠葛。我们在最初的剧本里处理这两个人物关系，比现在的剧本要稍微明朗些。后来有人认为不妥当，我们自己也觉得，在战争艰难的情况下，一个军人怎么能够跟一个地方女同志谈恋爱呢？但按人物的发展似乎又需要，在取舍不决的情况下，就改成现在剧本中的那种似是而非的关系了。
    最后，关于描写的真实性和历史的具体性与革命乐观主义的问题。我们所描写的撤退桃村的场面，虽然也表现了战士和居民的沉重的心情，但还不够深刻有力。按历史的真实情况，当战士群众和人民群众对运动战思想未搞通时，部队打了胜仗后又大踏步后撤，他们所流露出来的情绪，比我们剧本里所描写的要浓厚得多，复杂得多。经过这次全国电影剧本创作会议的学习，我初步体会到，真实地描写才能表现出历史的具体性，它与革命的乐观主义并不矛盾，因为人的思想、感情是复杂的，由低级到高级是有过程的，在这过程中是有许多矛盾和斗争存在的，人物在一定的斗争环境中所流露出来的一定的情感和变化，这是符合人的思想发展规律的。如果当部队撤退桃村时战士和人民群众无动于衷（或者是轻描淡写的表现，或者是笑），它不但不能表现出革命的乐观主义精神，相反的，是违反了描写的真实性和历史的具体性，把革命的乐观主义的精神庸俗化了。
    我们是第一次写电影剧本，特别是第一次写以战略思想为主题的电影剧本，虽然得到领导上的扶持和帮助，但由于我们的思想、艺术水平的限制，这一剧本里还存在着某些缺点。有人说，“南征北战”是毛主席的运动战的战略思想“图解”。我领会这批评的精神，主要是指的我们的剧本，没有能够将应该展开的矛盾和斗争充分地展开，即没有充分地将张连长、王春、赵玉敏、刘永贵妻等人对运动战思想由不通到通这中间所发生的矛盾和斗争展开；没有艺术地、动人地刻划出在精神上给人以深刻印象的正面人物，没有创造出值得做人们榜样的英雄典型人物。经过这次学习后，的确发现了自己过去在创作思想，创作方法上的许多模糊认识。当然，今天的认识还是肤浅的，今后应更进一步的学习社会主义现实的创作方法，在不断的创作实践中逐步提高认识和创作能力。（以上均作者个人意见，未与该片另二位编剧沈西蒙、顾宝璋同志讨论，不妥之处由我个人负责——作者附记。）
