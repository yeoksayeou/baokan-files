    Resolution of the Japanese People's Congress for Peace
    [Report from our Tokyo correspondent] The "Japanese People's Congress for Peace," held in Tokyo on March 21 and 22, passed eight resolutions and two documents, namely "Letter to the People of All Countries of the World" and "Letter to All Japanese People." The resolutions and documents are as follows:
    Resolution of the Japanese People's Congress for Peace
    For two days, March 21st and 22nd, 600 representatives from 39 prefectures, including Hokkaido in the north and Kyushu in the south, participated in the "Japanese People's Congress for Peace" held in Tokyo. We brought the situations from various places and, based on this, seriously discussed how to defend peace. As a result, we have reached complete agreement on the following points:
    One, demand an immediate cessation of the Korean War;
    Two, oppose the militarization of Japan;
    Three, resolutely demand the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction such as atomic and bacteriological weapons;
    Four, demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China, and the rapid establishment of good-neighborly and friendly relations;
    Five, Asians must never fight Asians;
    Six, uphold the peaceful constitution and oppose the revival of militarism;
    Seven, demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact;
    Eight, demand cultural exchange, free trade, and freedom to travel abroad.
    We agree to continue to work together to expand the movement to defend peace in the future.
                                    The Japanese People's Congress for Peace
                                      March 22, 1953
    Letter to the People of All Countries of the World
    To the Twenty Billion People of All Countries in the World:
    As you know, we, the Japanese people, are now under the pressure of world war forces and are increasingly being drawn into a state of war. Disregarding the opposition of the people, a "peace treaty" that claims to be "for peace" but makes the people of Asia the enemy has been concluded. Therefore, the peaceful constitution has been brutally trampled by the government itself. First, more than 600 military bases and countless munitions factories have ravaged the entire country. Then, the Anti-Subversive Activities Law and other reactionary bills preparing for war have been continuously formulated, trampling on all human rights of the people. In today's situation where national autonomy and national independence are merely nominal, and even the right to decide on war or peace has been deprived, you probably understand how difficult our peace movement is facing.
    Therefore, we were unable to send representatives in an official form to last year's Asian and Pacific Peace Conference and the World People's Peace Congress.
    All the nations in the world's colonies have already begun to stand up, and some of you may wonder why we, the Japanese people, who live in such shameful national humiliation, are rising up so slowly; but we have never lost confidence in ourselves. The Japanese people also have the same national vitality as the people of other countries. Today, people from all over Japan, who are selected as representatives of the Japanese conscience, are gathered in Tokyo to hold the "Japanese People's Congress for Peace." After two days of enthusiastic discussion, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted (see above).
    These resolutions are precisely the concentrated expression of the entire will of the Japanese people. We believe that no matter how the situation deteriorates in the future, the Japanese people's ardent hope for peace will continue to rise and will expand and penetrate into the hearts of all 85 million Japanese people.
    People of all peace-loving countries in the world: We feel extremely honored to be able to join hands with you and carry forward the most sublime torch of conscience in this world.
    Long live the people of all countries who demand world peace!
    Long live the "Japanese People's Congress for Peace," which carries forward the torch of human conscience together with the people of all countries in the world!
                                The Japanese People's Congress for Peace
                                      March 22, 1953
    Letter to All Japanese People
    To the Eighty-Five Million Japanese People from Hokkaido in the north to the Amami Islands and the Okinawa Islands in the south:
    As you know, our nation has now been thrown into a national humiliation unprecedented in our history. Whether it is politics, economy, education, or culture, almost everything will be bound by foreign domination. In this situation, due to the so-called "US-Japan Security Treaty," we have even been deprived of the right to decide on major issues concerning the life and death of all the people, such as war or peace. The army established in this hateful state will never be used to fight for the happiness of the Japanese people themselves. No matter how the Japanese rulers try to justify it, the actual world situation is trampling on the will and hope of the Japanese people and stubbornly rushing towards its goals; in some cases, it will even use the Japanese army established in this way to suppress the Japanese people's independence and peace movement. Just thinking about the stalemate in the Korean War makes it clear what the purpose of accelerating the militarization of Japan is.
    We believe that we must now rise up to resolutely oppose the revival of militarism, which has caused the greatest misfortune to the Japanese people and all Asian nations. We believe that in order to crush the war crisis that is attacking us like dark clouds, now is the time when the entire nation must unite and act resolutely.
    People of the whole country: Now we have fallen into a major crisis that determines the survival of the Japanese nation. At this time, if we cannot rise up, then I am afraid we will disappear forever from the history of the world.
    With this awareness, we held the "Japanese People's Congress for Peace" here today, unanimously adopted the following resolutions (see above), and decided to work hard to achieve them. We hope you will give us your support and assistance!
                                The Japanese People's Congress for Peace
                                      March 22, 1953

    日本人民争取和平大会的决议
    【本报讯】东京消息：三月二十一、二十二日在东京举行的“日本人民争取和平大会”，通过了八项决议及“告世界各国人民书”、“告全体日本人民书”两项文件，决议及文件如下：
    日本人民争取和平大会决议
    三月二十一日和二十二日两天，我们来自北起北海道南迄九州的三十九个都、道、府、县各方代表六百人，参加了在东京举行的“日本人民争取和平大会”。我们带来了各地的情况，并以之为基础，对如何保卫和平的工作认真讨论后，结果对以下各点已完全意见一致：
    一、要求立即停止朝鲜战争；
    二、反对日本军事基地化；
    三、坚决要求禁止原子、细菌之类的大量杀人武器；
    四、要求恢复与苏联和中国的国交，并迅速建立善邻友好的关系；
    五、亚洲人绝对不和亚洲人作战；
    六、拥护和平宪法、反对复活军国主义；
    七、要求五大国缔结和平公约；
    八、要求文化交流、自由贸易及出国自由。
    我们约定，今后仍将继续协力来扩大保卫和平的运动。
                                    日本人民争取和平大会
                                      一九五三年三月二十二日
    告世界各国人民书全世界各国二十余亿人民：
    正像你们所知道的一样，现在我们日本人民是处于世界战争势力的压迫下，正日益将被卷入战争的状态中。由于不顾人民的反对，缔结了自称是“为了和平”而以亚洲人民为敌国的“和约”，所以和平宪法遭到政府本身的残暴蹂躏；首先是六百多个军事基地和无数的军火工厂糟蹋了整个国土，接着是连续制订了防止破坏活动法及其他准备战争的反动法案，使人民的一切人权都受着蹂躏。在这样国家自主、民族独立实际上都只是有名无实，甚至连对战争或是和平的决定权都被剥夺了的今天，我们的和平运动遭受着多么困难的阻挠，大概你们也是明白的。
    所以，去年亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和世界人民和平大会，我们都没有能够用正式的形式派遣代表。
    世界上所有殖民地的各民族都已经开始站起来了，而生活在这样可耻的民族屈辱中的我们日本人民，却起来得这样慢，你们当中也许有人会对此感到奇怪；但是我们决没有对自己丧失信心。日本人民也具有着和其他各国人民同样的民族活力。今天，从全日本各地选出来的代表日本良心的人们，聚集在东京，举行“日本人民争取和平大会”，经过了两天的热烈讨论，全体一致通过了下列各项决议（见前）。
    这些决议才正是日本人民全体意志的集中表现。我们认为今后不管情势如何恶化，日本人民热切争取和平的希望将会更加高涨起来，而一直扩展深入到八千五百万全体日本人民的心中。
    全世界各国爱好和平的人们：我们能够和你们紧紧携手共举着这个世界上最崇高的良心的火炬前进，感到无上光荣。
    要求世界和平的各国人民万岁！
    与世界各国人民共同高举着人类良心的火炬前进的“日本人民争取和平大会”万岁！
                                日本人民争取和平大会
                                      一九五三年三月二十二日
    告全体日本人民书北自北海道南至奄美大岛、冲绳诸岛的八千五百万日本人民：
    正像你们所知道的一样，现在我们的民族已被投入我国有史以来从未有过的民族屈辱中。无论是政治、经济、教育、文化几乎都将被束缚在外国的支配之下。在这种情势中，由于有了那个所谓“美日安全协定”，我们连对于战争或是和平那种关系全体人民死活的重大问题的决定权都被剥夺去了。在这种可恨的状态下所建立的军队，绝对不会用来争取日本人民本身的幸福，这是明如观火的。尽管日本统治者们怎样辩解，但是，实际的世界情势却是践踏着日本人民的意志和希望，蛮横地硬要向着它的目标狂奔；在某种场合，甚至将如此建立的日本军队用来镇压日本人民的独立与和平运动。只要想一想朝鲜战争的僵局，就明白加紧日本军国主义化的目的是为了什么，这是再清楚不过的事了。
    我们认为现在必须起来坚决反对曾使日本人民及全亚洲各民族陷于最大不幸的军国主义的复活。我们认为为了粉碎像乌云一样向我们头上袭来的战争危机，现在正是必需全国人民团结一致坚决行动起来的时候了。
    全国人民：现在我们已经陷到决定日本民族存亡的重大危机中了，在这种时候，如果还不能够奋起，那么恐怕我们定会从世界的历史中，永远消失我们的踪影。
    在这种觉悟下，我们今天在这里举行了“日本人民争取和平大会”，全体一致通过了下列各项决议（见前），并决定为其实现而努力，希望你们予以支援和协助！
                                日本人民争取和平大会
                                      一九五三年三月二十二日
