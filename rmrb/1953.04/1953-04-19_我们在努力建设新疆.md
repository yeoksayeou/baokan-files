Comrades of the People's Volunteers—Our Dear Comrades-in-Arms:

Spring has arrived in Xinjiang, on our motherland's western frontier. In this season of gentle breezes and bright sunshine, everyone is thinking of you—our heroic comrades-in-arms in the Volunteers, fighting on the Korean front, far from home.

Comrades! I know that as you strike at the American beasts on the battlefields amidst the flames of war, you are deeply concerned about the construction of our motherland. Let me tell you about some of the progress the People's Liberation Army is making in building Xinjiang!

Hu Zhenshan, a soldier from a certain unit, wrote this poem:

	"A good place, our motherland's frontier,
	Vast is the region, wide the land.
	Rich in resources,
	Gold, silver, copper, iron ore in hand;
	Endless grasslands,
	Horses, cattle, sheep graze free;
	Canals built,
	The Gobi turns to farms, you see;
	Coal is mined, ores are opened,
	Great factories are built with glee.
	Frontier soldiers are strong,
	Xinjiang they'll build, like heaven, for all and me."

Comrades! This is no longer a beautiful hope, but a foreseeable prospect.

Comrades! Today's Xinjiang is no longer an endless wilderness. In the past three years, the People's Liberation Army has reclaimed 1.67 million mu of wasteland in the uninhabited areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. We have widely applied new Soviet machinery, improved varieties, and advanced production experiences to these lands, giving rise to the nationally renowned Ma Deliu high-yield group and Wang Bosheng high-yield group. And you must know the name of Zhang Diyuan, the first female tractor driver in the Xinjiang Military Region! I remember you even wrote to her asking for photos of her at work. Comrades! Today, it is not just one Zhang Diyuan driving a tractor across this beautiful land, but many Zhang Diyuans. It was not easy for them to master these production techniques, but the heroic images of Jie Xiumei, Ding Shufen, and Chen Min on the Korean front constantly inspire them, enabling them to overcome all difficulties.

Xinjiang has a dry climate and little rainfall. For many years, the saying "With water, there is land; without water, there is no field" has been circulating among the farmers of all ethnic groups. Therefore, our soldiers brave the gales and heavy snow, the scorching sun and sudden rain, to conquer drought by building water conservancy projects. In the past three years, nearly three hundred large and small canals have appeared in the areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. On the canal construction sites, one can see slogans posted everywhere by the builders of the motherland: "No matter how hot the sun, it's not as hot as our labor enthusiasm. No matter how strong the wind and sand, it's not as strong as our confidence in construction. No matter how hard the stones, it's not as hard as our will to overcome difficulties. No matter how vast the Gobi, it's not as vast as our desire to create a happy life."

One winter night, at a certain canal construction site, the bright moonlight, combined with the reflection of the white snow all over the mountains, made it seem like dusk. In the tent, I heard two people on the left side of the canal reciting rhythmic verses in unison: "Hateful America spreads bacteria, intending to kill the people of China and Korea, words can't express the hatred in our hearts, partners! Keep the hatred firmly in your hearts, carry more stones to resist America and aid Korea, build the canal foundation early, one stone fills one hole, just like the Volunteers annihilating American soldiers." Following the sound, I walked to the canal gate, where Chen Zhongke, a fifty-three-year-old cook, and Wu Rui, a seventeen-year-old messenger, were jumping into the water to carry stones, even though the surface of the water had already frozen over. I asked, "Aren't you going to sleep?" Old Chen rushed to say, "Recently, the news of America spreading bacteria reached here, and it made the comrades very angry. The comrades have launched a vigorous movement to carry stones to resist America and aid Korea, but Xiao Wu and I couldn't get our turn. Now we're just stealing some time to work overtime. Comrade, you know how glorious it is to work a little more to resist America and aid Korea!" Dear comrades-in-arms! This is the wish of these two people, and it is the wish of thousands of frontier soldiers.

In the wilderness where only birds flew, wolves howled, and no one set foot before, magnificent factory buildings have now emerged, and thick smoke, heralding the prosperity and happiness of the frontier, billows from the towering chimneys. The soldiers are building the motherland's emerging industry with funds accumulated from agricultural production and frugality, and with selfless labor that knows no summer heat or winter cold, no holidays or vacations. Here, large quantities of steel, machinery, fuel and power, non-ferrous metals and textiles will be produced.

The lives of the workers in these factories have greatly improved. Let me tell you about the life of an ordinary military industrial family. Sun Jinshui, a worker in the repair shop of a certain automobile repair factory, looks younger when he happily performs production on a new semi-automatic lathe, from his healthy and full face. Now there are four people in his family: his wife, Wu Zihua, works as a cook in the factory; his eight-year-old daughter, Lanlin, attends elementary school, and his one-year-old daughter, Lingling, is also in a nursery. His family lives in a clean and spacious worker's dormitory, with everything they need to wear, eat, and use. In the evening, when the adults and children all return home, this room is filled with happy laughter. Sun Jinshui, who had suffered from hunger and cold in the old society, can't help but feel younger in such a happy life. This year, he has completed his production tasks four times in a row, and he has donated all the bonuses he received to resist America and aid Korea. He said, "Only with the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea can we have a good life."

Comrades, as the motherland's first Five-Year Plan begins, we solemnly assure you: we will make the western frontier of the motherland as beautiful as a garden.

We wish you eternal victory!

### 我们在努力建设新疆

    我们在努力建设新疆
    志愿军同志们——亲爱的战友们：
    春天已经来到了祖国西陲的新疆。在这风和日丽的春天里，人们都在怀念着你们——远离祖国，战斗在朝鲜前线的英雄的志愿军战友们。
    同志们！我知道当你们在炮火连天的战场上打击着美国野兽的时候，你们是万分关怀着祖国的建设的。那就让我来告诉你们，解放军建设新疆的一些情形吧！
    某部战士胡振山写过这样一首诗：
    “祖国边疆好地方，地区宽来面积广。出产很丰富，金银铜铁矿；草原没有边，牧放马牛羊；兴修各水渠，戈壁变农场；挖煤又开矿，建造大工厂。边疆战士力量大，
    能把新疆建设得像天堂。”
    同志们！这已不是一个美好的希望，而是可以看见的远景了。
    同志们！今天的新疆已经不再是一望无际的荒野了。三年以来，解放军已经在天山南北渺无人迹的荒地上开垦了一百六十七万亩土地，并且在这些土地上广泛地运用了苏联的新式机器、优良品种和先进生产经验，出现了全国闻名的马德如丰产小组和王伯生丰产小组。还有，你们一定知道新疆军区的第一名女拖拉机手张迪源的名字吧！我记得你们还给她来信要她的劳动时的照片呢。同志们！今天驾着拖拉机驰骋在这块美丽的土地上的，已经不是一个张迪源，而是许多个张迪源了。她们掌握这样的生产技术并不容易，可是朝鲜前线的解秀梅、丁淑芬、陈敏们的英雄形象时时刻刻在鼓舞着她们，使她们没有克服不了的困难。
    新疆是个气候干燥、雨量稀少的地方。多少年来各族农民中间就流传着“有水就有地，无水就无田”的话。于是，我们的战士就不顾狂风大雪，不顾烈日骤雨，用兴修水利来战胜干旱。三年来在天山南北地区已经出现了大小近三百条水渠。在修渠的工地上，到处都可以看到张贴着的祖国建设者们的豪语：“太阳多热，没有我们劳动的热情热。风沙多大，没有我们建设的信心大。石头多坚，没有我们克服困难的意志坚。戈壁多广，没有我们创造幸福生活的愿望广。”
    一个冬天的夜晚，在某水渠的工地上，通明的月亮加上满山遍野的白雪的反光，真像是傍晚时分。我在帐篷里听到左边渠道上有两个人声音一起一落地说快板：“可恨美国撒细菌，心想杀害我中朝人民，千言万语说不尽心头恨，伙伴们！牢牢把仇恨记在心，多搬几块抗美援朝石，早日打好渠根基，一块石头填一个洞，就像志愿军消灭美国兵。”我顺着声音走到水渠闸口，五十三岁的炊事员陈中科和十七岁的通讯员武瑞两人正跳在水里搬石头，可是水面上已冻上冰壳了。我问：“你们还不睡吗？”老陈抢先说道：“最近美国撒细菌的消息传到这儿，可把同志们气坏了。同志们掀起了热火朝天的抗美援朝搬石运动，可是我和小武轮不上，现在我们就来个偷空加班。同志，你知道为抗美援朝多劳动一点是多么荣耀啊！”亲爱的战友们！这是他们两个人的心愿，也是千万个边疆战士的心愿。
    在从前只有鸟飞狼嗥，没有人迹的荒野上，现在却出现了一幢幢宏大壮丽的工厂厂房，从高耸的烟囱里冒出了预示着边疆繁荣和幸福的浓烟。战士们用农业生产和节衣缩食积累起的资金，用不分炎夏和寒冬，不过节日和假期的忘我劳动建设起祖国的新兴的工业。这里将要生产出大量的钢铁、机器、大量的燃料动力，大量的有色金属和纺织品。
    在这些工厂里，工人们的生活已经大大改善了。让我告诉你们一个普通军工家庭生活的情况吧。某汽车修配厂修理车间的工人孙金水，当他愉快地在新式半自动车床上进行生产的时候，从他健康丰满的脸上，你会看到他更年轻了。现在他家里有四口人：他的妻子吴自华在厂里作炊事员；八岁的大女儿兰林上小学，一岁多的小女儿玲玲也进了托儿所。他家住着一座清洁宽敞的工人宿舍，穿的、吃的、用的一应俱全，晚上大人小孩全回了家，这个房间里就充满了幸福的笑声。经受过旧社会饥寒交迫苦难的孙金水，在这样幸福的生活里怎么能不年轻呢？今年一年中他接连四次完成了生产任务，他把四次获得的奖金全部都作了抗美援朝的捐献了。他说：“只有抗美援朝的胜利，我们才能有好日子过。”
    同志们，当祖国第一个五年计划开始的时候，我们庄严地向你们保证：我们要使祖国的西陲变得和美丽的花园一样。
    祝你们永远胜利！
