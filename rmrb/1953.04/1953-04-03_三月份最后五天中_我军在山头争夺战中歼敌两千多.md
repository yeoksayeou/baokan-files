Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 2nd: In the last few days of March 27th to the end of the month, our army continued to inflict heavy casualties on large numbers of enemy troops in the battle for many hills on the front line.

    On the western front, the battle for Shangpu Fangdong Mountain (i.e., the "Old Baldy") northwest of Lianchuan has come to an end. The heavily casualty-suffering US military only sent out a platoon for an attack on the morning of the 27th. After this platoon of enemy troops was repelled by our defending troops, the enemy did not approach this mountain range again, but bombarded it day and night with artillery fire and sent out a large number of aircraft to bomb this area. After the 28th, the fighting on Shangpu Fangdong Mountain subsided, and this mountain range is still in the hands of our army.

    The battle for Meihyan-ri Dongshan and Matap-ri Xishan, northwest of Gaolangpu-ri, is still going on. After our army occupied these two connected mountain ranges on the night of the 26th, we repelled the enemy's small-scale counterattacks that night. On the morning of the 27th, the enemy attacked Matap-ri Xishan six times and Meihyan-ri Dongshan once with two battalions of troops, but were all repelled by our army. On this day, our army annihilated more than 600 enemy troops. On the morning of the 28th, the enemy dispatched six aircraft to bomb and strafe Matap-ri Xishan for more than an hour, and after carrying out two artillery bombardments, they sent infantry to attack our army. However, the leading enemy company was fiercely bombarded by our artillery fire when it advanced to more than 100 meters from this mountain range. The enemy troops suffered more than 60 casualties and retreated. At about 11 o'clock, the enemy sent another battalion to attack, and our army used skillful tactics and accurate firepower to block them at every step, inflicting casualties on the enemy. When the enemy just stepped onto the mountain, they were immediately subjected to fierce artillery bombardment by our army, causing more than 100 casualties. On this day, the enemy suffered more than 300 casualties from our army. After the 29th, only small groups of enemy troops attacked Meihyan-ri Dongshan, but were all repelled by our army's infantry and artillery. By the 31st, our army had annihilated more than 1,200 men of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Navy on these two mountain ranges.

    In these five days, our army carried out four surprise attacks in other areas of the front line, annihilating more than 300 enemy troops in total. On the night of the 28th, on Loutai Dongshan, northeast of Gaolangpu-ri on the western front, the entire defending enemy, about two platoons of the U.S. 2nd Division, a total of more than 60 men, were wiped out; on the night of the 29th, our army on the eastern front captured an important position of the 7th Division of the South Korean army near the rock cave west of Wendeng-ri, annihilating an entire company of the enemy, a total of more than 200 men.

    In these five days, our army's front-line mobile artillery killed and wounded a total of 497 enemy troops; the front-line anti-aircraft artillery shot down 17 enemy aircraft and damaged 20 enemy aircraft.

    三月份最后五天中
    我军在山头争夺战中歼敌两千多
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】三月二十七日到月底的几天中，我军继续在前线许多山头争夺战中杀伤大批敌军。
    在西线，涟川西北上浦防东山（即敌人所称的“老秃山”）上的争夺战，已告一段落。遭受惨重伤亡的美军在二十七日早晨，只派出一个排进行了一次攻击。当这一排敌军被我守军击退之后，敌人就没有再向这座山岭接近，只是日夜用炮火轰击，并出动大量飞机向这一带山岭投弹轰炸。二十八日以后，上浦防东山上战斗沉寂，这个山岭仍在我军手中。
        高浪浦里西北的梅岘里东山和马踏里西山上的争夺战，还在继续进行。二十六日夜，我军攻占了这两个相连的山岭之后，当夜即将敌人小规模的反扑打退。二十七日早晨，敌人以两个营的兵力向马踏里西山攻击六次，向梅岘里东山攻击一次，都被我军打退。这一天我军共歼敌六百多名。二十八日早晨，敌人出动六架飞机向马踏里西山轰炸扫射一个多小时，并进行了两次炮轰之后，才出动步兵向我军进攻。但是最先进攻的一连敌军在进到距这座山岭百多公尺处，就遭到我军炮火的猛烈轰击，敌军伤亡六十多名后溃退。十一时许，敌人又派出一个营来进攻，我军以巧妙的战术和准确的火力节节阻击，予敌杀伤。当敌人刚刚踏上山头时，立即遭到我军猛烈的炮火轰击，伤亡一百多人。这一天敌人共被我军杀伤三百多名。二十九日以后，只有小股敌军向梅岘里东山攻击，都被我军步兵和炮兵击退。到三十一日止，我军在这两个山岭上，共歼灭美海军陆战队第一师一千二百多名。
    在这五天中，我军在前线的其他地区进行了四次袭击战，共歼敌三百多名。二十八日夜，在西线高浪浦里东北楼岱东山全歼守敌美军第二师约两个排，共六十多名；二十九日夜，东线我军攻占文登里以西岩洞附近李伪军第七师的一个重要阵地，歼敌一个整连，共二百多人。
    这五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军四百九十七名；前线高射炮火共击落敌机十七架，击伤敌机二十架。
