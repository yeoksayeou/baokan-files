Xinhua News Agency, April 15th. Concurrently with the "Czechoslovak Republic Film Week," the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government is holding a "Czechoslovak Film Photo Exhibition" in eleven cities in China. The cities hosting the photo exhibition are: Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Harbin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Guangzhou.

　　These pictures were shipped from Czechoslovakia, totaling twelve sets, each set containing eighteen large boards and one hundred and twelve pictures. The pictures systematically and vividly introduce the development and growth of Czechoslovak cinema, which follows the path of Soviet cinema. The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party determined the general policy of Czechoslovak film art in April 1950 – to follow the path of socialist realism. The pictures introduce many excellent Czechoslovak films. Some of these films reflect the historical films of past people's revolutionary struggles, some are biographical films narrating the lives and careers of outstanding politicians, scholars, and artists, and there are also many animated films, puppet films, popular science films, and documentaries.

　　The "Czechoslovak Film Photo Exhibition" in Beijing officially opened at the Beijing Library on the afternoon of the 15th and will tour the Labor People's Cultural Palace and Zhongshan Park on the 19th.
