    A Self-Deceiving Plan
    By our reporter Fu Dong
    The Central Ministry of Food formulated a "1953 Grain Circulation Plan" last December. Some cadres said: This plan was created under the circumstances of "the higher-ups demanding it, the lower-levels being unable to report it, and the middle just making it up blindly." Because this plan was not practical, it was ultimately "disrupted."
    Last October, cadres of the Planning and Statistics Department of the Central Ministry of Food heard the news that the Second National Grain Work Conference would be held in mid-December, so they rushed to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to ask for figures, preparing to make a 1953 Grain Circulation Plan (including plans for grain purchase, sales, export, processing, and allocation, among which the most important is the allocation plan). At that time, everyone had a blindly optimistic attitude, believing that "there have been no problems with grain in recent years." Leading cadres of the Planning and Statistics Department said: "Calculate what can be calculated, estimate what can't be calculated, and if it can't be estimated, everyone just blows it up a bit." Some people participating in the formulation of the plan also believed: The Central Financial and Economic Commission has a control figure, so just propose a target based on this figure, and then "balance" the numbers, and the problem will be solved. So everyone just went in circles on the forms, adding a little in this area, and subtracting a little in that area; discussing this or that allocation, whether it could be "laid out" or "couldn't be laid out" on the table. The Planning and Statistics Department spent forty days "hard work" drafting a plan, and everyone felt that some of the figures were not accurate, but no one went deep down to do some necessary investigation. In the process of preparing this plan, the personnel involved rarely analyzed and studied the changes in the rural economy, although these materials could be found in the reports from various regions and the "Work Communications" published by the Ministry of Food. What Soviet grain work experience could be learned? No one paid attention; even less did anyone think of sending the balanced figures down level by level, letting the lower levels discuss them, combine them with the specific local conditions, and propose preliminary plans from the bottom up, and then synthesize them into a national plan. They blindly proposed grain reserves and export numbers without objectively calculating the inventory, the possible market supply, the possible purchase volume, and the necessary sales volume and demand inside and outside the market. Everyone was busy when they suddenly heard that "the Second National Grain Work Conference will not be held." The personnel of the Planning and Statistics Department all breathed a sigh of relief, and the preparatory work relaxed. By mid-December of last year, they suddenly received a notice: "The Second National Grain Work Conference will still be held." But at this time, there were only a few days left before the meeting. The Planning and Statistics Department had to produce a "Circulation Plan," a "Cost Plan," and a "Financial Plan" in four days. So they decided to spend a day and a half creating the "1953 Grain Circulation Plan." (Although it was extended for a few days later, the time was still too short.) This flustered the representatives from the major administrative regions and the cadres of the planning section. During the day, meetings were held, and at night, the cadres of the planning section used the already drafted Circulation Plan and the materials brought from below to "touch heads" and "balance forces." Representatives from some areas, because they didn't know the situation, didn't dare to accept the allocation tasks arranged by the higher-ups. However, the cadres leading the plan-making thought: Certain areas are always uncomfortable allocating grain every year, just impose the task on them, and they can complete it when they go back. Therefore, he neither found comrades who had just returned from below to report on the situation, nor paid attention to the opinions of the representatives below, while other personnel responsible for making the plan hoped to quickly determine the figures, aggregate them, and get the job done. In the process of drafting the plan, the director of the Planning and Statistics Department was ordered to specifically formulate the Five-Year Plan and rarely concerned himself with the 1953 Grain Circulation Plan. And at this National Grain Work Conference, the leading cadres, being busy with other things, did not pay good attention to the Grain Circulation Plan. When the meeting was about to end, the personnel of the planning section, in order to prepare the summary, worked overtime overnight to rush out the "1953 National Grain Circulation Plan" and the "National Grain Circulation Plan for the First Quarter of 1953." Representatives from some areas felt unsure about completing the tasks set in this way and said: If you do this, we will not be responsible if problems occur. The responsible cadres of the Business Management Department of the Ministry of Food saw that things were difficult and had to "persuade and mobilize" in every possible way. Some representatives were unsure, and in the end, they reluctantly said: "We'll go back and arrange things and see."
    After a representative from a certain area returned, he immediately convened a meeting of all grain bureau directors in the area and forced the task down; some provinces below, because they didn't know the situation, didn't accept the task either. This situation was reported to the Central Ministry of Food, and the ministry sent people down to investigate and learned that the Circulation Plan made at the Second National Grain Work Conference was not fully based on facts.
    It was only natural that such a plan would not work. For example, the East China Grain Bureau kept calling the Central Ministry of Food, urging them to ask about the grain allocation figures for February 1953. According to the original regulations: The quarterly allocation plan should be issued by the Central Ministry of Food to the major administrative regions 45 days before the start of the quarter; the monthly plan should be officially issued by the Central Ministry of Food to the major administrative regions 42 days before the start of the month for implementation. However, the Central Ministry of Food did not issue them on time according to the prescribed dates. The allocation plan for the first quarter of 1953 (including the February plan) was delayed by 45 days from the prescribed issuance date. After receiving the plan, the East China Grain Bureau arranged for the provinces to implement it that night (December 29, 1952). On the morning of the 31st, the East China Grain Bureau was studying the allocation of figures to the provinces with relevant units when it suddenly received a call from the Business Management Department of the Central Ministry of Food, notifying them of the grain allocation figures for February. This figure was very different from the figures in the already issued plan. The East China Grain Bureau then called the Planning and Statistics Department of the Central Ministry of Food to inquire, but the answer was different from the previous two times, and was a new figure. The East China Grain Bureau, fearing that it would change again, called the Planning and Statistics Department of the Central Ministry of Food again: Is this last figure definite? The Planning and Statistics Department of the Central Ministry of Food said:
    "We'll study it again and notify you tomorrow." On the second day (January 3rd), they had not received a notice in the afternoon, so the East China Grain Bureau called to inquire again, and the Planning and Statistics Department replied: "It hasn't been studied yet, we'll study it again this morning and notify you immediately." The 4th was Sunday, and on the morning of the 5th, the East China Grain Bureau called again, and the Planning and Statistics Department said: "We studied half of it yesterday, we'll study it again this morning and notify you immediately." Only in the afternoon did they receive a call from the Business Management Department of the Central Ministry of Food saying: Temporarily implement according to the last figure. But by the afternoon of January 6th, the planned figures changed again when the Central Ministry of Food notified the grain distribution points. In this way, the February allocation plan changed six times. Because the overall plan changed from time to time, it affected the allocation plans of provinces, prefectures, counties, and even grassroots grain work units, creating many unreasonable phenomena of reciprocal transportation and cross-transportation.
    The director of the Planning and Statistics Department lacked a serious and responsible attitude towards grain planning work. He once said: The Ministry of Food's plan is not well made, but the Ministry of Food has not had any serious violations of law and discipline. He emphasized the objective difficulties of planning work, saying: The minister asked me to work on the Five-Year Plan and nothing else, how can I combine the plan with the market situation?

    一个自欺欺人的计划
    本报记者  傅冬
    中央粮食部在去年十二月制订了一个“一九五三年粮食流转计划”。有的干部说：这个计划是在“上面一定要，下面不能报，中间瞎胡造”的情况下编造出来的。这个计划因不切合实际，结果被“打乱”了。
    去年十月，中央粮食部计划统计司的干部听到十二月中要开第二届全国粮食工作会议的消息，就忙着到农业部、财政部、全国合作总社去要数字，准备作一九五三年粮食流转计划（包括粮食购、销、出口、加工和调拨等方面的计划，其中最主要的是调拨计划）。当时大家有个盲目乐观的情绪，认为“粮食这几年没发生过问题”。计划统计司的领导干部说：“能算的就算，不能算的就估计，不能估计的大家就吹一吹。”一些参加制订计划的人也认为：中央财政经济委员会有个控制数字，根据这个数字提出个指标，再把数字“平衡”一下，问题就解决了。于是大家就在表报上转圈子，在这个地区添点，在那个地区减点；议论着这样或那样调拨，在表上能“摆得开”或“摆不开”。计划统计司“辛辛苦苦”地花了四十天功夫拟定了个计划，大家觉得有些数字不够准确，但谁也没有深入下去作一些必要的调查。在准备这个计划的过程中，有关人员很少分析研究农村经济情况的变化，虽然这些材料从各区来的汇报和粮食部出版的“工作通讯”上都可以找得到。苏联的粮食工作经验有那些可以学习？谁也没有注意；更没人想到要把平衡出来的数字逐级发下去，让下级加以讨论，结合当地的具体情况，自下而上地提出初步计划，然后综合起来，制成全国计划。他们没有客观地计算库存量、可能的上市量、可能的收购数、市场内、外必需的销售量和需要量，就盲目地提出了粮食储备数和出口数。大家正在忙得不可开交，忽然听说“第二届全国粮食工作会议不开了”。计划统计司的人员都松了口气，准备工作就松下来了。到去年十二月中，忽然又得到一个通知：“第二届全国粮食工作会议还是要开。”但这时离开会的时间只有几天了。计划统计司必须在四天之中作出“流转计划”、“费用计划”和“财务计划”。于是他们就决定用一天半的时间编造“一九五三年粮食流转计划”。（后来虽然延长了几天，但时间还是太短促。）这就把大行政区来的代表和计划科的干部都搞慌了。白天开会，晚上由计划科的干部根据那份已拟好的流转计划草案，和下面带来的材料“碰头”，“平衡力量”。部分地区的代表因心里无数，不敢接受上面布置的调拨任务。但领导作计划的干部却认为：某些区每年调拨粮食都是这样不痛快，硬给他按上任务，回去也能完成。因此，他既没有找刚从下面回来的同志汇报情况，也没有理会下面代表的意见，其他负责作计划的人员则希望很快地把数字确定下来，加以汇总，交差了事。在拟订计划的过程中，计划统计司的司长受命专门制订五年计划，很少过问一九五三年的粮食流转计划。而在这次全国粮食工作会议上，领导干部因为忙着别的事情，也没有很好地注意粮食流转计划。会议快结束的时候，计划科的人员为了准备总结，连夜加班，把“一九五三年全国粮食流转计划”和“一九五三年第一季度全国粮食流转计划”赶了出来。部分地区代表对于这样定出的任务，感到没有把握完成，就说：你们这样作，发生了问题，我们不负责任。粮食部经营管理司的负责干部看到事情不好办，只得好说歹说地“说服动员”，一些代表心里也没底，最后只好勉强说：“回去布置着看。”
    某区代表回去以后，立刻召开了全区粮食局长会议，硬把任务往下压；下面有些省因不摸底，也不接受任务。这个情况反映到中央粮食部，部里派人下去了解，才知道第二届全国粮食工作会议上所作的流转计划是没有充分根据的。
    这样的计划一定行不通，原是很自然的。例如，华东粮食局不断打电话到中央粮食部，催问一九五三年二月份的粮食调运数字。根据原来规定：季度调拨计划在季度开始前四十五天，就应由中央粮食部下达到大行政区；月度计划在月度开始前四十二天，由中央粮食部正式下达各大行政区执行。但中央粮食部并未按规定的日期及时下达。一九五三年第一季度调拨计划（包括二月份计划）比规定的下达日期延迟了四十五天。华东粮食局接到计划后，当晚（一九五二年十二月二十九日）就布置各省执行。三十一日上午，华东粮食局正和有关单位研究分配各省数字，忽然接到中央粮食部经营管理司的电话，通知二月份的调运数字，这个数字和已下达的计划数字相差很大。华东粮食局又以电话请示中央粮食部计划统计司，但答复又与前两次不同，而是一个新的数字。华东粮食局害怕以后还会改变，再以电话向中央粮食部计划统计司请示：最后这个数字，是否肯定？中央粮食部计划统计司却说：
    “我们再研究研究，明天通知你。”在第二天（一月三日）下午还没有接到通知，华东粮食局又以电话请示，计划统计司答复说：“还没研究好，研究好就通知你。”四日是星期日，五日上午华东粮食局再度以电话催问，计划统计司说：“昨天研究了一半，今天上午再研究研究，马上通知你。”下午才接到中央粮食部经营管理司的电话说：暂按最后那个数字执行。但到一月六日下午，中央粮食部通知发粮点时，计划数字又变了。就这样，二月份调拨计划变动了六次。由于总计划时时变动，牵动了省、专区、县以至基层粮食工作单位的调拨计划，造成许多不合理的相向运输和交叉运输的现象。
    计划统计司的司长对粮食计划工作缺乏严肃的认真负责的态度。他曾这样说：粮食部的计划作得不好，但粮食部还没有发生过严重的违法乱纪现象。他强调计划工作的客观困难，说：部长让我搞五年计划，不搞别的，我如何能把计划与市场情况相结合呢？
