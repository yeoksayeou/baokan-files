Experiences in Organizing Parallel Flow Operations in Construction
Wang Shuyao, Director of the First Engineering Area, Construction Engineering Company Directly Under the Ministry of Heavy Industry

In the past, when we were building standard family dormitories in Shenyang, the construction period for a single unit was ninety days. Since learning from the Soviet Union’s advanced experience of "organizing parallel flow operations according to instruction charts," the construction period for the same family dormitories in the Shenyang Workers' Village was shortened to fifty-two and a half days. Subsequently, when building family dormitories for the Ministry of Heavy Industry in Beijing, the construction period for the same unit was only thirty-two days, increasing work efficiency by nearly two times. This not only powerfully demonstrates the advanced nature of parallel flow operations, but more importantly, it made us realize that this advanced experience can be implemented in large-scale projects. We have the following experiences in promoting this advanced experience.

    I. Basic Concepts of Parallel Flow Operations

"Parallel flow operations" should include two basic concepts: "parallel operations" and "flow operations."

    (1) Parallel Operations: Two or more types of work being carried out in the same area (same building, same floor, or same section of the house) at the same time. There are roughly two types: one is on the same construction section, where bricklayers build the outer wall, and carpenters simultaneously support the formwork or floor joists inside, with both types of work advancing side by side. Another type is, for example, when the upper part is brick wall construction, and the lower part follows with pointing or plastering, with a difference in vertical position and a slight sequence in the work processes.

    (2) Flow Operations: A construction team composed of one or more types of work continuously performing various procedures of work in a work area or on a work object. There are also two types: for example, a bricklaying team carries out bricklaying in three sections, laying section A in the morning, section B in the afternoon, and then moving to section C the next day. This cyclical operation within different floors or sections of a unit project can be called "small flow operation." After a bricklaying team completes one floor, they transfer to another unit project to lay bricks while waiting for the concrete floor slab to be poured; this is called "large flow operation." Flow operations involving two or more types of work are also very common, such as the flow operation of carpenters, bricklayers, painters, and ordinary workers in roofing projects, and the flow operation of carpenters, steelworkers, and concrete workers in reinforced concrete projects.

In preparatory processing procedures and direct construction procedures, the flow operation methods are different. In the former, operators or machines are fixed, and work objects move between various processes to carry out flow operations. For example, Xie Wanfu's door and window processing flow operation method involves moving door and window sashes between processes such as cutting materials, planing, chamfering, notching, marking, shouldering, mortising, chiseling, and installation. In the latter, the operators are mobile, while the work object is fixed. For example, Su Changyou's bricklaying method involves apprentices delivering bricks and mortar or pulling the mortar spreader in front, bricklayers laying the inner and outer skins of bricks, and another apprentice following behind to grout. In this way, the wall is fixed, and the workers are mobile. Yang Dezong's plastering method and Yu Donghai's pointing method are both this type of flow operation.

In addition to understanding the above two basic concepts, it is also necessary to master the different modes of flow operations during the construction process. The construction process includes the following procedures:

    A. Preparatory Processing Procedures - such as making door and window sashes, mixing mortar, prefabricating reinforced concrete components, making floors, mixing paint, etc. These are preparatory processing stages for direct construction.

    B. Transportation Procedures - such as carrying bricks, carrying mortar, transporting door and window sashes, hoisting prefabricated floor slabs, etc.

    C. Auxiliary Procedures - such as erecting scaffolding, supporting formwork, etc.

    D. Direct Construction Procedures - Bricklaying, plastering, pouring concrete, installing door and window sashes, installing roof frames, painting, etc. These are processes of direct construction on buildings.

"Parallel operations" aim to make full use of time and space, and therefore are the main factors in shortening the construction period and speeding up the progress. The main purpose of "flow operations" is to give full play to labor efficiency and reduce waste and confusion caused by work interruptions or imbalances in work efficiency. Therefore, they are the main factors in saving labor and reducing costs. Parallel flow operations must be combined to carry out construction in a balanced and rhythmic manner.

    II. How to Organize Parallel Flow Operations

Scientifically preparing construction instruction charts and organizing the design of work schedules and construction layouts are concrete measures for organizing parallel flow operations. What we are currently promoting is only the construction instruction chart, but there are still many shortcomings in the compilation of charts. Looking at the "progress chart," which is the most basic component, it generally only includes the progress of structural engineering and decoration engineering, but lacks the progress of water, heating, and electrical installation engineering. This prevents civil engineering from being well coordinated with water, heating, and electrical engineering. Often, after the walls and ceilings are built, they are dug and opened to install pipes and wires, resulting in waste or poor quality. Another shortcoming is that the chart only shows the progress of direct construction procedures and lacks the progress of preparatory processing, transportation, and auxiliary procedures. This prevents the other three procedures from serving the direct construction procedures in a planned manner, easily leading to work stoppages and idle labor due to poor coordination. Based on our experience in preparing construction instruction charts, if directly related sub-projects are arranged into a series to stipulate progress, the project progress can be made more compact and clear. We call these series "work systems."

For example, in the decoration project, the following three work systems can be divided:

    1. Interior Plastering Work System: includes plastering, painting, etc.
    2. Exterior Plastering Work System: includes wall skirting, pointing, etc.
    3. Door and Window Sash Work System: includes fitting door and window sashes, installing glass, painting, etc.

The number of construction workers and the construction time for each floor and section should be calculated according to scientific formulas. In the past, we often decided the time required for each floor and determined the amount of labor based on subjective requirements or experience. This often led to idle labor due to too many workers, affecting worker efficiency and wage income. Conversely, too few workers would prevent the full use of time and space.

Direct construction procedures are greatly limited by the working surface. Therefore, appropriately organizing this procedure and carrying out construction in the most economical time is a direct factor in shortening the construction period. In particular, reasonably organizing parallel flow operations of direct construction procedures is of great significance. We achieved great gains in building the family dormitories of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in Beijing simply by achieving this.

In addition to being limited by the working surface, direct construction procedures are also limited by natural conditions such as climate, sunny or rainy weather, day or night. This is different from preparatory processing procedures. Moreover, preparatory processing procedures have more favorable conditions for implementing mechanization and factory production. However, direct construction procedures, such as bricklaying, plastering, and installing doors and windows, are not easy to mechanize due to the high mobility of operations. Therefore, in order to further accelerate project progress based on organizing parallel flow operations, it is necessary to transform multiple items in direct construction procedures into preparatory processing procedures for factory and mechanized production. The Soviet Union has a wealth of experience in this regard, such as prefabricated floor slabs, prefabricated assembly of steel structures, prefabricated assembly of concrete structures, and the use of prefabricated plastering templates for plastering projects. The principle is to transform direct construction procedures into preparatory processing procedures to save direct construction time. Based on this principle, we also achieved some success in building the family dormitories of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in Beijing. For example, we installed window sashes in the windows in advance and painted them once, and then built them together when building the walls, which shortened the construction period by four and a half days. Items such as floors, ceilings, and grey strip partition walls can also be pre-processed into floor pieces and grey strip pieces, and then installed on the ceilings and walls, but we did not implement this.

In addition, the speed of preparatory processing procedures, transportation procedures, and auxiliary procedures has a great impact on whether direct construction procedures can be carried out smoothly. Therefore, reasonably and scientifically planning the organization of these procedures and incorporating them into the instruction chart is also an important task.

    III. Technical Measures and Organizational Measures for Organizing Parallel Flow Operations

In addition to preparing detailed and scientific instruction charts, organizing parallel flow operations also requires considering specific technical measures and organizational measures to ensure the realization of parallel flow operations. For example, when organizing the flow operation of bricklayers, two sets of auxiliary tools such as buckets and mortar troughs should be prepared. When organizing parallel operations, the mutual influence and mutual restraint between different types of work should be carefully considered. For example, building bricks in the upper part and following up with plastering or pointing in the lower part violates safety operating procedures. But we solved this problem by using scaffolding to build a layer of protective panels and making workers operating in the lower part wear willow hats. Another example is that floor joists are originally built on the outer wall, which hinders the parallel operation of bricklayers. We researched a method of pre-supporting floor joists like supporting formwork, which created conditions for the parallel operation of carpenters and bricklayers. At the stairwell, it is generally necessary to wait until the entire project is completed before plastering, otherwise, walking back and forth will damage the newly plastered plaster or terrazzo. However, we enabled painters and electricians to go up and down the stairs from the scaffolding through the windows instead of going through the stairwell, so the stairwell could be plastered in advance, thereby shortening the construction period.

In terms of organizational measures, in addition to formulating construction instructions, there must also be a certain organization to supervise the implementation of the instructions. In the past, due to the lack of a strong organizational force, no one was responsible. We believe that establishing a dispatching agency is necessary. Because if technical supply and construction progress cannot closely cooperate with the progress of the project, it will inevitably suffer setbacks midway. The main task of the dispatching agency is to strengthen the organization, implement the instructions, and prevent unexpected situations in a predictive manner. In addition, the Soviet Union also implemented the organization of joint teams, which can promote cooperation between different types of work, specifically implement the team operation plan in the instructions, reduce the burden on construction personnel, and effectively ensure the implementation of the instructions. We believe that this is also a specific organizational measure in organizing parallel flow operations, and various joint teams can be considered and compiled according to the work system.

    在施工中组织平行流水作业的几点体会
    重工业部直属建设工程公司  第一工区主任  王述尧
    我们过去在沈阳修建标准家属宿舍时，单位工程的工期是九十天，自从学习了苏联“按指示图表组织平行流水作业”这一先进经验之后，在沈阳工人村建筑同样的家属宿舍，单位工程的工期就缩短为五十二天半；接着在北京修建重工业部的家属宿舍，同样单位工程的工期只需三十二天，工作效率提高了将近两倍。这不但有力地证明了平行流水作业的先进性，更重要的是使我们认识到这一先进经验可以在大规模的工程中实行。对于推行这一先进经验，我们有以下几点体会。
        一、平行流水作业的基本概念
    “平行流水作业”应该包括“平行作业”与“流水作业”两个基本概念：
    （1）两个以上的工种，在同一区域（同一幢、同一层或同一段的房屋），同一时间内进行工作，就是平行作业。大体上有两种类型：一种是在同一施工段上，瓦工砌外墙，木工同时在内部支模型板或楼板楞条，两个工种齐头并进。另一种类型，例如在上部砌砖墙，下部跟着就勾缝或抹灰，位置有上下之别，工序略有先后之分。
        （2）一个工种或两个以上的工种组成的施工小组，在工作区或工作对象上，连续进行各个工序的工作，叫做流水作业。也有两种类型：例如瓦工小组进行三段砌砖，上午砌甲段，下午砌乙段，次日又移到丙段，这样在单位工程内不同的层或段之间循环作业，可叫“小流水作业”；瓦工小组砌完了一层楼之后，在等待打混凝土楼板的间歇中，转移到别的单位工程去砌砖，叫“大流水作业”。两个以上的工种进行流水作业也很普遍，例如屋面工程中的木工、瓦工、油工、普通工的流水作业，钢筋混凝土工程中木工、铁筋工、混凝土工的流水作业等。
    在预备加工工序中和直接施工工序中，流水作业方式是不同的。前者，操作人员或机械是固定的，工作物移动于各工序之间进行流水作业。例如谢万福的门窗加工流水作业法，就是门窗扇移动于截料、刨光、倒棱、截口、划线、拉肩、开榫、凿眼、安装等工序之间进行流水作业。后者的操作人员是移动的，而工作对象是固定的。例如苏长有的砌砖法，就是徒工在前递砖、递灰或拉铺灰器，瓦工砌里外皮砖，另一徒工在后跟着灌浆，这样墙是固定的，而工作者是移动的。杨德重抹灰法、于东海勾缝法都是这一类型的流水作业。
    除了理解上述两个基本概念之外，还应掌握施工过程中流水作业的不同方式。施工过程包括下列几个工序：
    甲、预备加工工序——如制作门窗扇、拌和沙浆、预制钢筋混凝土配件、制作地板、调合油漆等工作，是为了直接施工的准备加工过程。
    乙、运搬工序——如挑砖、挑灰、运送门窗扇、吊预制楼板等运搬工作。
    丙、辅助工序——如搭脚手架、支模型板等辅助工作。
    丁、直接施工工序——砌砖、抹灰、浇灌混凝土、安装门窗扇、装房架、刷油漆等在建筑物上直接施工的过程。
        “平行作业”的作用在于充分利用时间和空间，因此它是缩短工期、加快进度的主要因素；“流水作业”的主要作用在于充分发挥劳动效率，减免因工作间歇或工作效率不平衡而产生的浪费与混乱现象，因此是节约劳动力、降低成本的主要因素。平行流水作业必须结合，才能均衡而有节奏地进行施工。
    二、怎样组织平行流水作业
    科学地编制施工指示图表，进行工作日程和施工布置的组织设计，是组织平行流水作业的具体措施。我们现在所推行的只有施工指示图表，但在编制图表中还存在着很多缺点。以其中最基本的组成部分“进度表”来看，一般只包括结构工程与装饰工程的进度，而缺少水暖电气的安装工程的进度，这样就使土木工程不能与水暖电气工程很好地配合，往往修好了墙和天棚，为了装管装线，又去刨开挖洞，造成浪费或使得质量低劣。另一个缺点是图表上只有直接施工工序的进度，而缺少预备加工、运搬、辅助等工序的进度，这样就使其他三个工序不能有计划地为直接施工工序服务，容易因配合得不好而产生停工、窝工现象。根据我们编制施工指示图表的经验，如将直接有关的分部分项工程，排成一个系列来规定进度，则可以使工程进度更加紧凑与清晰，这些系别我们称之为“工系”。
    例如装饰工程中就可分下面三个工系：
    1、内粉刷工系：包括抹灰、刷油等。
    2、外粉刷工系：包括抹墙裙、勾缝等。
    3、门窗扇工系：包括掩门窗扇、上玻璃、刷油等。
    关于每层每段的施工人数与施工时间，应该根据科学的公式计算。过去我们只根据主观要求或经验来决定每层需要多少时间，并据此来决定劳动力的数量，就往往因人工过多而造成窝工，影响工人操作效率，影响工资收入，反之也会因人工过少而不能充分利用时间与空间。
    直接施工工序受工作面的限制是很大的，因此适当地组织这个工序、用最经济的时间来进行施工，是缩短工期的直接因素，特别是合理地组织直接施工工序的平行流水作业，更有重要的意义。我们在北京修建重工业部家属宿舍工程中，仅仅由于做到了这一点，就得到很大的收获。
    直接施工工序除受工作面的限制以外，还受到气候、晴雨、昼夜等自然条件的限制，这是不同于预备加工工序的。况且预备加工工序在实行机械化与工厂化的工作中有比较优越的条件，但直接施工工序如砌砖、抹灰、安装门窗等工作则因操作流动性很大，就不容易实行机械化。因此为了在组织平行流水作业的基础上进一步加速工程进度，就必须把直接施工工序中的多种项目转化为预备加工工序，以便进行工厂化与机械化的生产。苏联在这方面的经验是非常丰富的，如预制楼板、钢结构预制装配、混凝土结构预制装配，以及用预制抹灰样板进行抹灰工程等，其原理都是将直接施工工序转化为预备加工工序，借以节省直接施工的时间。根据这个原则，我们在北京修建重工业部家属宿舍工程中，也曾做到了一些，例如把窗扇事先安到窗口上，刷头
    一遍油，在砌墙时一齐砌起，这样就缩短了四天半的工期。像地板、天棚和灰条间壁墙等，也可以预先加工为地板片、灰条片，然后装钉到天棚和墙上；但我们不曾实行。
    此外，预备加工工序、运搬工序与辅助工序的速度，对于直接施工工序能否顺利进行是有很大影响的；因此合理而科学地计划这些工序的组织并编制到指示图表中去，也是一项重要的工作。
    三、组织平行流水作业的技术措施与组织措施
    组织平行流水作业，除了编制细致而科学的指示图表之外，还须考虑具体的技术措施与组织措施以保证平行流水作业的实现。例如组织瓦工的流水作业，应该把水桶、灰槽等辅助工具准备两套。组织平行作业时，应周密考虑到工种间互相影响、互相牵制的问题。如上部在砌砖，下部跟着进行抹灰或勾缝，是违反安全操作规程的，但我们利用脚手架搭了一层防护板，并使在下部操作的工人戴上柳条帽，这个问题就解决了。又如楼板楞条本来是搭在外墙上面的，这样就妨碍了瓦工砌砖的平行作业，我们研究出像支模型板一样来预支楼板楞的办法，就给木瓦工的平行作业创造了条件。在楼梯口上，一般要等全部竣工才能抹灰，否则来往行走，就会损坏了新抹的灰或水磨石，但我们使刷油工与电工等不经楼梯口而由脚手架通过窗口上下楼，于是楼梯口便可以提前抹灰，因而缩短了工期。
    在组织措施方面，在制定了施工指示图之外，还须有一定的组织来监督指示图表的实现。过去由于缺乏强有力的组织力量，就形成无人负责。我们认为建立调度机构是必要的。因为技术供应和施工进度，若不能密切配合工程的进行，中途必会遭受挫折。调度机构的主要任务，就是加强组织力量，贯彻指示图表，有预见地防止意外情况的发生。另外，在苏联还实行了联合小队的组织，它可以促进工种间的配合，具体贯彻指示图表中的小组作业计划，减轻施工人员的负担，并可以有效地保证指示图表的实现，我们认为这也是组织平行流水作业中的具体组织措施，是可以根据工系来考虑编制各种联合小队的。
