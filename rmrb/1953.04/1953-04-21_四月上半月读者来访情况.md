    Reader Visits in the First Half of April
    From April 1st to 15th, this newspaper received a total of 136 visits, involving 146 people. Among them, 91 were from the Beijing area, 28 were farmers from rural areas of Changping, Ji, Mancheng, Nangong and other counties in Hebei Province, 3 were from Tianjin, and the rest were from other provinces and cities across the country. The visitors included workers and farmers, staff from government agencies, organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises, doctors, teachers, and students, revolutionary soldiers, and ordinary citizens.

    In the first half of the month, 18 people came to discuss marriage issues. Some inquired about issues related to the Marriage Law; some criticized the local government and courts for improperly handling marriage cases and requested the newspaper's support. Many were farmers from rural areas of Hebei, mainly exposing the bad work styles and erroneous behaviors of some district and village cadres, such as coercive orders, violations of laws and regulations, and shielding bad people and deeds. A noteworthy issue was a temporary worker from a private electrical supply shop who came to report that the shop's capitalist had used inferior wire instead of good wire and old goods instead of new goods when replacing wires for a hospital, and he accused the shop of retaliating against him by firing him for reporting this situation to the management personnel responsible for the work at the hospital. An educator who had just returned from Lixian County reported that the county had a tendency toward formalism in leading the patriotic production increase campaign in rural areas. It was said that in some villages in the county, every household displayed red flags and made plans, appearing lively on the surface, but the masses were not actually mobilized. For the above issues, in addition to providing explanations based on relevant central policies, they have all been compiled into written materials and forwarded to relevant authorities for investigation and handling.

    In addition, issues discussed included disputes over land rights, housing rights, debts, equity, and household affairs, unresolved issues from the "Three-Anti" campaign, as well as job applications, and inquiries about methods for repaying pre-war deposits. These specific issues should generally be resolved by local people's governments, courts, or relevant units such as the People's Bank. We are not in a position to handle them on their behalf, so we asked them to consult with relevant departments.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    四月上半月读者来访情况
    四月一日到十五日本报共接待来访一百三十六次，一百四十六人。其中来自北京市地区的九十一人，从河北省昌平、冀县、满城、南宫等县农村来的二十八人，从天津市来的三人，其余，是从全国其他各省、市来的。来访者有工人和农民，有机关、团体和工矿企业的工作人员，有医生、教师和学生，有革命军人，还有市民群众。
    在这半个月中来谈婚姻问题的有十八人。其中有的询问有关婚姻法的问题；有的对当地政府和法院处理婚姻案件不当提出批评，并要求本报给予支持。还有不少是来自河北各地农村的农民，他们主要是揭发某些区村干部强迫命令、违法乱纪、包庇坏人坏事等不良作风和错误行为。值得注意的问题还有：一个私营电料行的临时工人来检举该行资方给某医院换电线时，以次线充好线、以旧货充新货的非法行为，并控告该行因他把这个情况反映给医院负责这个工作的管理人员，而遭受到资方解雇的报复。一个刚从蠡县回来的教育工作者，反映该县在领导农村爱国增产竞赛运动中有形式主义偏向。据称：该县有的村家家插红旗，户户订计划，表面上轰轰烈烈，但实际上群众并没有发动起来。对于以上问题，除根据中央有关政策决定给予解释者外，均已整理成书面材料，转请有关机关调查处理。
    此外，来谈的问题还有关于地权、房权、债务、股权和家务等纠纷，“三反”中遗留问题以及求职、询问战前存款清偿办法等。这些具体问题一般都应由当地人民政府、法院或人民银行等有关单位具体解决，我们不便代为处理，故请他们去有关部门洽商。
