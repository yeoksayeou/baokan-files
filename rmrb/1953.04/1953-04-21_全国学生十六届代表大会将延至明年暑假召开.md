    The enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the 15th Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation was held in Beijing in mid-March. The meeting was attended by the chairman and vice-chairmen of the All-China Students' Federation, executive committee members in Beijing, heads of various departments, and heads of student federations in Beijing, Hebei, Hubei and other places.
    The meeting listened to and approved the report on the work of the All-China Students' Federation over the past year and a half made by Chairman Tian Demin. It also discussed the current work of the student unions. The meeting held that the student unions should carry out their work in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the 15th National Student Congress, combined with the current specific circumstances. The main content should be: 1. Encourage students to study hard, care about the students' lives and welfare, and pay attention to carrying out recreational and sports activities; 2. Reflect students' opinions and demands to the school administration and relevant parties, strengthen democratic life, and strengthen ties with the vast number of students. At the same time, the meeting pointed out that the scope of work of some student unions is currently too large, and the organizational structure is too large, overlapping, and should be streamlined carefully in accordance with the above principles. The student union itself should not emphasize system leadership, but should mainly obtain the guidance of the school administration and the regular assistance of the Communist Youth League under the leadership of the Party.
    In order to better prepare for the 16th National Congress of the All-China Students' Federation, which was originally scheduled to be held this year, the Presidium decided to recommend to the 15th Executive Committee that the Congress be postponed to next summer vacation. The meeting also elected the representatives of the All-China Students' Federation to attend the Second National Congress of Youth.

    全国学生十六届代表大会将延至明年暑假召开
    中华全国学生联合会第十五届执行委员会主席团扩大会议，于三月中旬在北京举行。参加会议的有全国学联主席、副主席、在京执行委员、各部负责人和北京、河北、湖北等地学联的负责人。
    会议听取并通过了田德民主席所作全国学联一年半来的工作的报告。并就当前学生会的工作进行了讨论。会议认为：学生会应根据全国学生第十五届代表大会决议的精神，结合目前的具体情况进行工作，其内容主要应是：一、鼓励同学努力学习，关心同学的生活福利，注意开展文娱体育活动；二、向学校行政和有关方面反映同学的意见和要求，加强民主生活，密切和广大同学的联系。同时，会议指出：目前有些学生会的工作范围太大，组织机构过于庞杂、重叠，应该根据上述原则认真精简。而学生会本身更不应强调系统领导，主要应在党的领导下，取得学校行政的指导和青年团的经常帮助。
    为了使原定在今年召开的中华全国学生第十六届代表大会的准备工作做得更好，主席团决定向第十五届执行委员会建议，将大会延期到明年暑假召开。会议上并选出了全国学联出席全国青年第二次代表大会的代表。
