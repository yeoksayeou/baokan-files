    A Firm Handshake, Sincere Learning
    Written to Welcome the Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic
    Ouyang Yuqian, President of the Central Academy of Drama

    When I was young, I loved riding horses, and my friends praised Mongolian horsemanship, which made me envious. However, I only saw Mongolian horses in movies and photos. Later, I saw Mongolian wrestling, which is a great sport and a martial art that Mongolians are particularly good at. The wrestlers are very lovable just walking onto the field with their strong and healthy postures. I wanted to learn but didn't, but it increased my longing for Mongolia. I couldn't help but think of the ancient poem "The sky is vast, the wilderness boundless, the wind blows and the grass bows to reveal cattle and sheep." In my imagination, Mongolia is a vast, magnificent, and poetic place.

    Recently, our dear brother country, the Mongolian People's Republic, sent a cultural delegation, the art troupe led by Comrade Oyun, to Beijing, and they performed music, dance, and acrobatics. I was very honored to see these wonderful performances.

    I love Mongolian folk songs and also love listening to the Morin Khuur (horsehead fiddle). Although I don't understand Mongolian and can't analyze the music like a musician, I think I can understand the mood—I close my eyes and listen, and I seem to see an endless grassland, with countless herds of cattle, horses, and sheep. The singing rises and falls on the vast land, echoing each other. The brave, hardworking, robust, and pure Mongolian working people are building their motherland with great enthusiasm and selfless effort. With unified steps, under the sun of truth, they have embarked on the road to freedom and happiness. Listen to them sing: My horse is so swift, it always comes in first in races. The scent of the grassland is so fragrant, it adds strength to life. They also sing:
    
    I ride a piebald horse
    Galloping like the wind in the wilderness. To be loyal to my country, heading towards a beautiful ideal.

    The beautiful songs express deep emotions. They are "dedicating everything best to the motherland" for a beautiful ideal. After listening to the songs, and then watching dances such as "Mongolian Dance" and "Herdsman's Dance," art with a strong national character attracts us to another realm, and a solemn and beautiful picture unfolds before me.

    As for acrobatics, it shows the close combination of physical strength and intelligence. Physical strength alone is not enough, but the composition of each program and the control of emotions and postures during the performance require the use of intelligence. You have to concentrate highly when performing, but the muscles also have to be relaxed, so it looks effortless. If the spirit is slightly tense, the performance will not be good, and things may go wrong. Also, acrobatics requires skillful, accurate, and natural techniques. Anything too delicate, complex, redundant, heavy, or unaesthetic, or bordering on cruelty, is inappropriate. It needs to make the audience feel healthy, beautiful, lively, and witty. Good acrobatics performances, although they cannot give the audience slogan-style education, can make the viewers' attention particularly focused and give healthy, lively, witty, and beautiful stimuli, increasing mental vitality, and greatly benefiting both body and mind. In this way, Mongolian acrobatics are good. Whether it is "Flexibility Dance," "Fitness Performance," or "Ladder Climbing," the techniques are very skillful, accurate, and natural; the images are very beautiful; there is no procrastination or superfluousness in the performance process, but it proceeds according to a certain rhythm, starting cleanly and ending neatly. It is indeed healthy, lively, beautiful, and clever.

    Also, the Mongolian art troupe is very good at learning from the Soviet Union, and they are willing to learn honestly. "Flexibility Dance" is no less impressive than Soviet flexibility skills. "Hunter and Birds" is also comparable. These have all been achieved through hard work. Skills don't come from nowhere, they are earned through labor. The Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic has given us a good opportunity to learn.

    Dear comrades, the cultural representatives of the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic, headed by Comrade Oyun! Thank you for performing the most wonderful programs for us. We are willing to learn more from you. In the future, we will further exchange culture. Comrades! Shake your hands tightly and wish the unbreakable friendship between China and Mongolia to further develop and consolidate!

### 紧紧的握手，诚恳的学习  为欢迎蒙古人民共和国艺术团而作

    紧紧的握手，诚恳的学习
    为欢迎蒙古人民共和国艺术团而作
    中央戏剧学院院长    欧阳予倩
    我年青的时候欢喜骑马，朋友们对我盛称蒙古的马术，使我不胜欣羡，可是我只在影片和照片里看到蒙古的马群；后来我见着蒙古的摔跤，那是一种很好的体育，也是蒙古人特别擅长的武术。摔跤的人走出场来雄健的姿态就很可爱。我想学没学会，可是增加了对蒙古的向往。我不由得想起“天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊”那几句古诗，在我的想像中蒙古是一个广大无涯，雄浑壮阔，富于诗意的地方。
    最近，从我们亲爱的兄弟国家——蒙古人民共和国派来了文化使节，以奥云同志为首的艺术团到了北京，表演了音乐、舞蹈和杂技，我很荣幸地看到了这些精彩节目。
    我喜爱蒙古民歌，也爱听马头琴。尽管不懂蒙古话，也无从像音乐家那样去分析乐曲，我自以为能领会那种情调——我闭着眼睛听，似乎看见一望无际的草原，有数不清的牛群马群和羊群；歌声在辽阔的土地上起伏，互相唱和。勇敢耐劳刚健纯厚的蒙古劳动人民正在以高度的热情，忘我的努力建设自己的祖国。他们用齐一的步伐，在真理的太阳照耀之下，走上了自由幸福的道路。听他们唱吧：我的马儿多么骏，比赛总是跑第一。草原的气息多么芬芳，它增添了生命的力量。他们又唱道：
    我骑着斑马
    像旷野里的疾风一样在驰骋着。为了忠实于自己的祖国，奔向一个美好的理想。
    美妙的歌声表达出深厚的情感，他们是为了一个美好的理想“将一切最好的献给祖国”的。听了歌，再看“蒙古舞”、“牧人舞”等等舞蹈，带着浓厚的民族色彩的艺术把我们吸引到另外一个境界，一幅庄严美丽的图画展开在我的面前。
    至于杂技，表现的是体力和智力的紧密结合。体力不能支持当然不行，但是每个节目的组成和表演时情绪和姿态的掌握非运用智力不可。表演的时候要把注意力高度集中，但肌肉也还是要松弛，这才显得游刃有余。倘若精神略带紧张就表演不好，还可能出乱子。还有就是杂技要求纯熟、准确而自然的技术。凡属过于纤细、繁复、冗长笨重或者形象不美，或者近似残酷的都不适当。需要使观众感到健康、美丽、活泼、机智。好的杂技表演虽不能给与观众以口号教条式的教育，但是它可以使看的人注意力特别集中而给与以健康、活泼、机智的、美的刺激，增加精神上的活力，于身心都有很大的帮助。照这样说蒙古的杂技是好的。无论是“柔软舞”、“健身表演”、“登梯”，技术都非常纯熟、准确而自然；形象都很美；表现过程中没有丝毫拖沓多余之弊，而是按着一定的节奏进行，起得干净，收得整洁。的确令人感到健康、活泼、美丽而显得聪明。
    还有就是蒙古的艺术团很善于学习苏联，他们肯老老实实的学。“柔软舞”比苏联的柔软工夫没有逊色。“猎人与飞鸟”也可以媲美。这些都是经过勤修苦练的。就是其它的每一个节目都看得出下过苦工。本事没有白来的，是劳力换来的。蒙古人民共和国艺术团给了我们很好的学习机会。
    亲爱的以奥云同志为首的、蒙古人民共和国劳动人民的文化代表同志们！感谢你们为我们表演最精彩的节目，我们愿更多的向你们学习。今后将更进一步交流文化。同志们！紧握你们的手，祝中蒙两国牢不可破的友谊进一步发展和巩固！
