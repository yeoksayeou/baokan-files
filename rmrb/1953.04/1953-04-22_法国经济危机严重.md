Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th dispatch: “Pravda” published an article from France by Henri Claude on the 15th, commenting on the increasing economic contradictions in France. Claude pointed out that France's industrial production is not only stagnant, but in some industries, production has gradually declined. Heavy industries such as coal, steel, and machinery manufacturing have also begun to be affected. Due to production cuts in some industries, the number of unemployed has surged. According to official statistics, as of March 1, the number of "unemployed" workers reached 216,710. According to trade union materials, the actual number of fully unemployed has increased to 600,000. In addition, there are 2.5 million partially unemployed.

In answering the question of whether the French bourgeoisie can hope to avoid the economic crisis by sacrificing other countries, Claude wrote: The foreign trade of capitalist countries shrank in 1952, which shows that France cannot expect to increase its exports to other capitalist countries. The struggle for markets has become extremely acute. The French bourgeoisie attempted to protect its domestic market to avoid competition from foreign goods, and took measures aimed at reducing the production costs of export commodities. This intensified trade contradictions between France and other capitalist countries, but did not produce the expected results. The trade deficit has increased instead. France's foreign trade deficit was 102 billion francs in 1950, 342 billion francs in 1951, and increased to 413 billion francs in 1952. According to newspaper reports, in February of this year, the deficit was another 23.364 billion francs.

Claude said that because of this situation, Mayer ran to London to beg for pounds and later went to the United States to beg for dollars. But his trip to Washington, like his trip to London, ended in disappointment. All economic conferences held in accordance with the "Atlantic" policy will have the same result, because every capitalist country demands that other countries open their markets so that its products can be sold, but at the same time refuses to open its own markets to the products of other countries. Each country calculates how to transfer the entire burden to its neighbors.

Claude added: France is on the verge of a serious crisis. Compared with all previous crises, this crisis has particular severity: first, this crisis is developing in a limited market, which has shrunk due to the division of the previously unified world market into two parallel markets; second, this crisis has matured in a country whose ruling group's domestic and foreign policies are subordinate to the interests of the aggressive bloc, which attempts to solve its own difficulties by sacrificing other countries and prohibits these countries from trading with the socialist camp; third, this crisis is growing against the background of continuous militarization of industry, which allows monopoly capitalists to obtain maximum profits, but makes the vast people increasingly impoverished.

    法国经济危机严重
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在十五日发表了亨利·克劳德从法国寄来的一篇文章，评述法国经济矛盾日益加深。克劳德指出：法国的工业生产目前不仅停滞不前，而且在有些工业中生产已经逐渐下降了。煤、钢铁工业和机器制造业等重工业也开始受到影响。由于有些工业削减生产，失业人数已经激增。据官方统计：到三月一日为止，“未被雇用”的工人已达二十一万六千七百一十人。根据工会的材料，实际上完全失业的已经增加到六十万人。此外还有二百五十万半失业者。
    在回答法国资产阶级能不能希望牺牲别国来避免经济危机的问题时，克劳德写道：一九五二年资本主义各国的对外贸易都在缩减，这就表明法国不能指望增加它对其他资本主义国家的输出。争夺市场的斗争已变得极其尖锐。法国资产阶级企图保护它的国内市场以避免外货竞争，并且采取一些目的在于降低出口商品的生产成本的措施，这使得法国与其他资本主义国家之间的贸易矛盾愈加激烈，却没有产生预期的结果。贸易逆差反而增加了。法国对外贸易的入超在一九五零年是一千零二十亿法郎，一九五一年是三千四百二十亿法郎，到一九五二年已经增加到四千一百三十亿法郎。据报纸消息，今年二月，逆差又有二百三十三亿六千四百万法郎。
    克劳德说：由于这种情况，迈耶才跑到伦敦去乞讨英镑，后来又去美国乞讨美元。但是他的华盛顿之行和伦敦之行一样，都是败兴而返。按照“大西洋”政策举行的一切经济会议都会得到同样结果，因为每个资本主义国家都要求别国开放市场，好让它的产品有销路，可是同时又拒绝为别国的产品开放自己的市场。各国都盘算如何把全部负担转嫁给它的邻国。
    克劳德又说：法国正处于严重危机的边缘。和以前所有的危机比较起来，这个危机具有特别的严重性：第一，这个危机要在一个有限的市场上发展起来，这个市场由于以前统一的世界市场分裂为两个平行的市场而缩小了；第二，这个危机已经在这样一个国家内成熟，这个国家的统治集团的内政、外交政策都服从于侵略集团的利益，而这个侵略集团企图牺牲其他国家来解决它本身的困难，并且禁止这些国家和社会主义阵营各国贸易；第三，这个危机是在工业不断军事化的背景上成长起来的，工业军事化使垄断资本家取得最大限度的利润，却使广大人民日益贫困。
