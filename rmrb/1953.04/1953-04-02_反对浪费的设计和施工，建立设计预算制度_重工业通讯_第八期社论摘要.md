Oppose Wasteful Design and Construction, Establish a Design Budget System
    ——Excerpts from the Eighth Issue of "Heavy Industry Communications" Editorial

Recently, the Ministry of Heavy Industry sent an inspection team to inspect the construction site of the Shenyang Institute of Technology and found that the design department lacked an economic accounting perspective and failed to formulate design estimates and design budgets, resulting in significant waste. Taking the construction cost of faculty and staff dormitories as an example, each square meter was 600,000 yuan more expensive than the standard dormitories of the former Northeast Industrial Department (40% higher). The high cost of these dormitories was mainly due to design errors. For example, the architectural design adopted an unreasonable narrow strip-shaped two-story building, which required more wall length, foundation height, and roof area per square meter of construction area than standard dormitories. There were also many wasteful and excessive features in decoration and equipment, such as heating radiators exceeding the standard by a quarter, and excessive use of terrazzo flooring and pebble-dash rendering. Waste of building materials was also significant. Standard dormitories used 468 red bricks per square meter, while Type A dormitories at the school used 595, Type B used 605, and Type C used 650. These wastes did not improve the strength of the building or expand the usable area. Taking the Type C dormitory as an example, the investment per household was 15 million yuan more than the standard dormitory, but the usable area was reduced by about 28%. This wasteful design should have been discovered during the design process, but because the designers lacked an economic accounting perspective, they did not prepare estimates or budgets, and instead handed the design budget to the construction department for preparation. Therefore, it was impossible to discover the economically unreasonable aspects of their design.

If the design budget is not formulated by the design department but by the construction department, many artificial errors are bound to occur. In June of last year, the construction site submitted a very large project budget based on the engineering design. After review by the former Northeast Industrial Department, this budget was cut by 17.5%. One project had an overestimation of 7 billion yuan. Another project had an overestimation of 900,000 red bricks for the foundation alone (enough to build a three-story standard dormitory of 1,900 square meters). For example, the roof design did not include lightweight concrete, but the budget included 500 cubic meters. The ceiling was made of wood, and only 0.032 cubic meters were needed per square meter, but the budget estimated 0.3 cubic meters, resulting in an excess of 1,300 cubic meters of wood. Errors in material unit prices were even more common. Over 60% of the investment reduction was due to inflated unit prices. For example, the budgeted price of asbestos ash was 20 million yuan per ton, while the actual price was only 1.6 million yuan; the budgeted price of gypsum ash was 5 million yuan per ton, while the actual price was only 450,000 yuan. These two materials alone accounted for an excess of 5 billion yuan. Furthermore, the budgeted price for iron pipes larger than two inches was 24 million yuan per ton, while the allocation price was only 10 million yuan. The unit prices of other general materials were also more than 10% higher. Although the project budget underwent repeated reviews and reductions, the results of this re-inspection proved that the actual cost was still 5% higher than the technical design estimate.

Because the project budget was not prepared in a timely manner, financial supervision could not be carried out during construction, and it was impossible to strictly promote economic accounting among construction enterprises. Among the 66 projects at the construction site, none had a budget prepared before construction, resulting in serious confusion in financial, cost, material, and engineering management. For example, 870 baskets of screws were required before the start of some projects, and 820 baskets were returned after completion. 30,000 extra sets of door and window hardware were purchased. 5,000 tons of cement had been used but were not recorded. The utilization rate of construction machinery was very low, with the hoist utilization rate being only 13.7% and the concrete mixer utilization rate being only 17.1%. The final account for the work area has not yet been prepared, and the leading cadres do not know the exact profit or loss.

What does this inspection report illustrate? First, it shows that many of our design departments are wasteful designers. They lack an economic accounting perspective when designing and use outdated technical and economic norms. They never conduct investment accounting for the factories, mines, schools, and buildings they design. They do not understand that designers are not only responsible for the production technology of the factories and mines they design but also have a major responsibility for the economic rationality of the factories and mines they design. Only when designers have a correct economic accounting mindset can they rationally use state funds to achieve maximum results in their design work, and study and adopt the most economical methods to build the most technically advanced and economically rational factories, mines, and buildings.

Second, this inspection report also shows that because the project budget is prepared by the construction department instead of the design department, the budgeting work is completely separated from the design work. The calculation of engineering quantities and the analysis of materials cannot be combined with the technical design, resulting in a series of errors. More seriously, this practice of having the construction department prepare the project budget completely eliminates the financial supervisory role of the project budget over the construction department. When preparing the budget, the construction department can intentionally inflate the norms in order to "easily and happily" complete the task of "reducing costs." This practice actually encourages the construction department to abandon economic responsibility and condones serious waste and financial chaos in construction. Therefore, this method of having the construction department prepare the project budget is clearly inappropriate.

Third, this inspection report also shows that the preparation of the project budget generally lags behind construction, which greatly reduces the significance of preparing the budget: it creates a certain degree of material backlog and labor allocation confusion during the construction process; in terms of financial management, it is necessary to follow the annual investment plan, lacking a clear basis for investment management of individual projects, and even causing overspending or surplus investment. Because the design budget is prepared too late, it is impossible to sign a contracting contract, which makes it impossible to promote correct economic accounting in the construction department.

Fourth, this report generally shows that there are extremely serious waste phenomena in our design and construction. Our various projects have huge potential for reducing costs. As long as we have reasonable design, correct organization of construction, and strict economic accounting management, we can save the country a large amount of funds and significantly reduce project costs. If leaders at all levels of industry do not see these shortcomings and errors, and do not expose and correct these errors from the bottom up and from the top down, then our leaders will become bureaucratic leaders, which will cause irreparable losses to the country.

In view of the fact that the above situation exists not only at the Shenyang Institute of Technology construction site but also to varying degrees in many design and construction departments, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in accordance with the spirit of the Central People's Government Financial and Economic Committee's "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work," has issued a decision to establish a design budget, defining the design budget as an important part of the technical design. All designers are not only responsible for the production technology of the factories and mines they design but also responsible for the economic rationality of the factories and mines they design. A design estimate should be prepared at the same time as the preliminary design, and a design budget should be prepared at the same time as the technical design. The design budget should be used as the basis for investment management of individual projects and as the basis for formulating contracting contracts. The establishment of the design budget system is a major measure to improve design work and promote economic accounting in the construction department. To implement this measure, we believe that:

First, designers should be educated to establish an economic accounting concept. Vivid and typical examples should be used to oppose wasteful design. Only in this way can we lay the ideological foundation for the establishment of a design budget system. Otherwise, even if a design budget system is established, it will inevitably become a mere formality.

Second, various budget norms should be prepared based on the actual situation in 1952 and by learning from advanced Soviet experience. The Ministry of Heavy Industry, in cooperation with various bureaus and companies, has begun to formulate budget norms for construction engineering, budget norms for exploration engineering, budget norms for mine mechanical and electrical engineering, mechanical installation, and electrical installation, as the basis for formulating design budgets this year. There is no doubt that these norms are very incomplete, very rough, and very inaccurate, and are also only for local areas. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously revise and supplement them in practice, based on the creativity of the masses and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. But even these norms are very useful for our design and construction this year. Taking the budget norms for standard dormitories in the Northeast region this year as an example, compared with the budget norms in 1952, the material cost has been reduced by 6% and the labor cost has been reduced by 22%. After the implementation of this norm, not only can the construction cost of standard dormitories be reduced by 10% compared to last year in terms of design budget, but it can also greatly promote the implementation of economic accounting in the construction department.

Third, the preparation and review of the design budget should be carried out conscientiously. It is undeniable that there are still many difficulties in preparing the design budget at present, such as inaccurate and incomplete norms, the lack of uniform national unit prices for many equipment and materials, and the lack of experience in preparing design budgets. However, if the work of preparing the design budget does not start now, it will be impossible to implement economic accounting in design and construction. To this end, all design departments in the Ministry of Heavy Industry system should establish design budget agencies this year, equip them with a certain number of technical cadres, learn from advanced Soviet experience, and conscientiously and responsibly formulate design estimates and design budgets, using design estimates and design budgets to analyze and study whether the investment is being used rationally, in order to oppose waste in design. The design review agency must be serious and responsible in reviewing the design budget in order to save national funds.

In order to make the design budget for this year practical and reasonable, the design department should invite capital construction administrative departments and construction departments to participate in the formulation of the design budget, so as to better consider the specific conditions of various construction sites and more fully incorporate various average advanced norms in construction into the design budget.

Fourth, construction should be carried out according to the design budget. All construction departments should sign contracting contracts with the client according to the design budget, and the construction department should not prepare a separate project budget. The design budget should become an important constraint on the implementation of economic accounting by the construction department. The construction department should formulate its own enterprise's production and financial plan for individual projects based on the design budget, propose cost reduction targets, and mobilize employees to fight against waste and achieve this plan.

    反对浪费的设计和施工，建立设计预算制度
    ——“重工业通讯”第八期社论摘要
    最近重工业部派出检查组检查了沈阳工学院的工地，发现由于设计部门缺乏经济核算观点，没有制定设计概算及设计预算，造成了很大的浪费。以其中一项工程设计——教职员宿舍的造价为例：每平方公尺即比原东北工业部的标准宿舍多六十万元（即高出百分之四十）。这些宿舍的造价所以这样贵，主要是设计上的错误。如建筑造型上采用了不合理的狭条形的二层楼建筑，每平方公尺建筑面积所占用的墙身长度、墙基高度、屋顶面积，都比标准宿舍多。在装饰及设备上亦有很多浪费和过度的地方，如暖气片超过标准四分之一，采用了过多的磨石子地面及水刷石抹面等。建筑材料方面的浪费也是很大的，如标准宿舍一平方公尺用四百六十八块红砖，而该校甲种宿舍则用五百九十五块，乙种用六百零五块，丙种用六百五十块。这些浪费，对房屋的坚固和扩大使用面积一点好处也没有。以其中的丙种宿舍为例：每户投资比标准宿舍多一千五百万元，但使用面积反而降低了百分之二十八左右。这种浪费的设计，本应当在设计的过程中就被发现，但由于设计人员缺乏经济核算观点，既不做概算又不做预算，将设计预算交施工部门编制，因而就不可能发现自己所设计的工程在经济上存在着极不合理的地方。
    设计预算不由设计部门制订，而由施工部门编造，必然会发生许多人为的错误。去年六月，这个工地根据工程设计，提出了一个非常庞大的工程预算。这个预算经过原东北工业部审核后，削去了百分之十七点五。其中一项工程竟多提了七十亿元。另一项工程仅基础部分就多算了九十万块红砖（这些红砖可以造一所一千九百平方公尺的三层楼标准宿舍）。再如宿舍屋顶设计上本没有轻量混凝土，预算却做上五百立方公尺；天棚用木材，实际每平方公尺只需点零三二立方公尺，预算却做成零点三立方公尺，共多木材一千三百立方公尺。在材料单价上，错误更多。审核削减的投资中，由于单价做高而造成的错误竟占百分之六十以上。如石棉灰预算每吨为二千万元，实际只需一百六十万元；石膏灰预算每吨为五百万元，实际只需四十五万元，以上二种材料即多出五十亿元。再如：二吋以上的铁管，预算每吨为二千四百万元，但调拨价格只一千万元；其他一般材料的单价也都超过百分之十以上。该项工程预算虽然经过一再审查与削减，但这次再检查的结果证明，实际上仍比技术设计多做了百分之五。
    由于工程预算编制不及时，在施工时没法进行财务监督，更不能严格促进施工企业的经济核算，在该工程处的六十六个工程中，没有一个在施工前编出预算，因此造成了财务、成本、材料及工程管理上的严重混乱状况。如有的工程开工前要八百七十箩螺丝钉，工程完了，退回了八百二十箩；门窗小五金多买了三万副；有五千吨水泥已经使用了，却未上账。施工机械利用率很低，卷扬机利用率仅为百分之十三点七，混凝土搅拌机仅为百分之十七点一。该工区至今工程决算尚未作出，究竟盈亏多少，领导干部不知道。
    上面这个检查报告说明了什么呢？第一、它说明了我们尚有不少设计部门是浪费的设计者，他们在设计时缺乏经济核算观念，采用了落后的技术经济定额，他们从来不对自己所设计的工厂、矿山、学校、建筑物进行投资核算。他们不了解设计人员不仅对自己设计的工厂、矿山负有生产技术上的责任，而且要对自己所设计的工厂、矿山在经济上是否合理负有重大责任。只有设计人员具有正确的经济核算思想，才能在设计工作中按着最大的效果来合理运用国家资金，才能研究采用最节约的办法来建设技术上最先进、经济上最合理的工厂、矿山和建筑物。
    第二、这个检查报告，也说明了由于工程预算不由设计部门编制，而由施工部门编制，就使得预算工作与设计工作完全脱节，在工程数量的计算和材料的分析上，就不能与技术设计相结合，因此就会发生一系列的错误。更严重的是这种没有设计预算，而完全由施工部门编造工程预算的做法，使工程预算对施工部门根本失掉了财务监督作用。施工部门在编制预算时，就可以有意把定额加大，以便“轻松愉快”地完成“降低成本”的任务。这种做法实际上促使施工部门放弃了经济责任，放纵了施工中严重的浪费与财务上的混乱现象。因此，这种由施工部门编制工程预算的办法，显然是不妥当的。
    第三、这个检查报告也说明了，编制工程预算一般都落后于施工，因此就大大降低了编制预算的意义：造成了施工过程中一定程度的材料积压与劳动力调配的混乱状况；在财务管理上，就不得不按年度投资计划进行，对单位工程的投资管理缺乏确切的依据，甚至造成投资上的超支或多余。由于设计预算编制过迟，无法签订包工合同，因而也就无法促进施工部门正确地进行经济核算。
    第四、这一报告总的说明了我们设计和施工中存在着极端严重的浪费现象。我们的各项工程在降低成本上存在巨大的潜在力量，只要经过合理的设计、正确的组织施工和严格的经济核算管理，就会给国家节约大批资金，就可能把工程成本大量的降低。如果各级工业领导者看不到我们这方面的缺点与错误，不自下而上地、自上而下地揭发这方面的错误，改正这些错误，则我们领导人员就会成为官僚主义的领导者，就会给国家造成不可弥补的损失。
    鉴于以上这种情况不仅在沈阳工学院一个工地存在，而是很多设计部门和施工部门都或多或少地存在着，因此重工业部根据中央人民政府财政经济委员会“基本建设工作暂行办法”的精神，发布了建立设计预算的决定，确定设计预算为技术设计的重要组成部分。所有设计人员不仅对自己设计的工厂、矿山负有生产技术上的责任，而且对自己设计的工厂矿山在经济上是否合理也负有责任。在编制初步设计的同时，要编制设计概算；在编制技术设计的同时，要编制设计预算。把设计预算作为单位工程投资管理的根据，同时也作为制订包工合同的根据。设计预算制度的建立，是改进设计工作与促进施工部门进行经济核算制的一个重大措施。为了执行这一措施，我们认为：
    首先，应当教育设计人员，使之树立经济核算观念。要用生动的、典型的例子去反对浪费的设计。只有如此，才能为建立设计预算制度打下思想基础。否则虽然建立了设计预算制度，也必然流于形式。
    其次，应根据一九五二年的实际情况，并学习苏联先进经验，编制各种预算定额。重工业部配合各局、公司，已开始制订了建筑工程预算定额、探矿工程预算定额、矿山机电工程预算定额、机械安装、电器安装等预算定额，作为今年制订设计预算的依据。毫无疑问，这些定额是很不全的，而且是很粗糙、很不精确的，同时也只有局部地区的。因此，需要在实践中，根据群众的创造及苏联的先进经验，不断修正与补充。但就是这些定额，对我们今年的设计与施工也是很有用处的。以今年东北区标准宿舍预算定额为例，它和一九五二年预算定额相比，材料费就降低了百分之六，人工费降低了百分之二十二。这个定额实行后，不仅从设计预算上可以使标准宿舍的建筑成本比去年降低百分之十，而且可以大大促进施工部门实行经济核算制。
    其三，认真进行设计预算的编制工作与审核工作。不可否认，目前编制设计预算还有许多困难条件，如定额不准、不全，很多设备及材料全国尚无统一的单价，缺乏编制设计预算经验等。但编制设计预算的工作，如不自现在开始，则经济核算制将不可能在设计与施工中贯彻。为此，今年重工业部系统所有设计部门都应该建立设计预算机关，配备一定数量的技术干部，学习苏联先进经验，审慎地负责地制订设计概算及设计预算，运用设计概算及设计预算来分析研究投资运用得是否合理，以反对设计中的浪费现象。设计审核机关更须严肃负责地对设计预算进行审核，以节约国家资金。
    为了使今年设计预算作得切实、合理，设计部门在制订设计预算时，应邀请基本建设行政部门及施工部门参加，以便更好地考虑到各个施工现场的具体条件，和更充分地把施工中各种平均先进定额吸收到设计预算中来。
    其四，按设计预算进行施工。所有施工部门应按设计预算与甲方订立包工合同，施工部门不另编工程预算。设计预算应成为施工部门实行经济核算的重要的约束力量。施工部门应根据设计预算制订自己企业的单位工程的生产财务计划，提出降低成本的指标，并动员职工为反对浪费、实现这个计划而奋斗。
