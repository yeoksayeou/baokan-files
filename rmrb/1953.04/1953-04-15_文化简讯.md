    The Public Security Forces of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held its first sports meet in Chongqing from April 1st to 8th, with more than 120,000 spectators. The vast majority of athletes participating in the games were soldiers, and there were also ethnic minority soldiers participating in the performances. All sports competitions achieved excellent results. Wan Youwen, a soldier from the direct unit of the Southwest Public Security Forces, achieved a "leap in the air" of 13.70 meters on a motorcycle, surpassing the record of 13 meters at the "August 1st" sports meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army last year. Most of the literary and artistic competition programs were written and performed by the soldiers themselves based on their actual lives, in various forms, showing the rich combat life of the public security forces soldiers. The Tibetan soldier Deng Zhizhaban's skillful "suona" solo and the dance "Tibetan Compatriots Sing of Chairman Mao" by Zhaxi and others fully demonstrated the ethnic minority brothers' love for the leader.

After watching the film, many farmers have drawn up patriotic production increase plans, expressing their intention to learn from the female protagonist Mariana, the "tractor driver," and actively participate in this year's patriotic production increase competition movement. "Spring in the Sagen" pointed out a bright future for farmers in mountainous areas and inspired their thinking about developing mountainous areas.
