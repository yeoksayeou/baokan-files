Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 13th: As the Korean War enters its third spring, the Korean-Chinese People's Army has achieved new victories in combat. The battles on the Korean front in March were more frequent and intense than in any month of winter. The Korean-Chinese People's Army engaged in 227 battles throughout the month, eliminating 15,577 enemy soldiers, an increase of 5,999 from February. Among them, the U.S. aggressor army suffered 8,253 casualties, exceeding the casualties of the Rhee Syngman puppet army.

In March, four large-scale battles occurred on the Korean front: one in the east and three in the west. The three fierce battles for positions in the west were the most intense since the Battle of Triangle Hill in the early winter of last year. In each battle, the U.S. aggressor army and its accomplice troops suffered heavy blows.

In early March, our troops on the eastern front captured two platoons' worth of positions southwest of Guandaili, east of Kimhwa, belonging to the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 6th Division. The defending enemy, after being hit, mostly fled into tunnels. From dusk on the 3rd, our army engaged in a day-and-night battle with enemy reinforcements, repelling more than ten counterattacks by enemy forces ranging from a platoon to a battalion. By the 13th, our army had completed its mission of annihilating the enemy and had proactively returned to its own positions. This battle eliminated more than 460 enemy soldiers. The three position battles in the west in late March took place one after another, each more intense than the last. On the night of the 21st, our army counterattacked Pingcun South Mountain, north of Gaolangpu, wiping out most of a platoon from the U.S. 2nd Division and repelling five counterattacks by a company of enemy reinforcements. On the night of the 23rd, another battle began on Sangpu-dong Mountain ("Baldy Hill"), northwest of Lianchuan. Our army captured this mountain ridge, completely annihilating a reinforced company from the Colombian battalion, and then stubbornly resisted continuous counterattacks by more than five battalions of the U.S. 7th Division on this mountain ridge. On this small mountain ridge, which is only one square kilometer in area, an average of more than 20,000 shells and more than 100 bombs fell every day. However, our army never allowed the enemy to set foot on this mountain ridge again. In the fierce battle lasting four days and four nights, our army eliminated more than 1,700 enemy soldiers. On the night of the 26th, our army counterattacked two positions of the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Division on Dong Mountain in Maehyun-ri and West Mountain in Matap-ri, northwest of Gaolangpu, completely annihilating the three reinforced platoons and a transport squad of the defending enemy that night. After that day, our infantry and artillery closely coordinated their operations, inflicting heavy casualties on the frantically counterattacking enemy. By the end of March, a total of more than 1,200 enemy soldiers had been eliminated.

In March, in addition to the above four battles, our army also conducted 48 counterattacks and ambushes on the entire front. In these counterattacks and ambushes, our army systematically annihilated eleven entire platoons, five entire squads, and most of four platoons of the U.S. army, a reinforced company of the Colombian army, one entire company, three entire platoons, six entire squads, and most of a platoon of the Rhee Syngman puppet army.

The enemy launched a total of 69 attacks and ambushes against our army's positions in March. They suffered heavy casualties and were unable to advance an inch. On the 10th, two companies of the U.S. 7th Division launched an attack on one of our positions near Sangpu-dong Mountain, northwest of Lianchuan on the western front, attacking from morning until dark and firing more than 10,000 shells at this small hilltop. In the end, they retreated dejectedly after suffering more than 150 casualties.

The enemy's fortifications on their positions, after more than a year of construction and renovation, are quite solid. For example, on Sangpu-dong Mountain, which is only one square kilometer in area, the enemy built more than 200 large and small, visible and hidden bunkers, with an average distance of about five or six meters between each bunker. The bunkers were covered with iron plates, wood, and thick layers of accumulated soil. In addition, the enemy also built underground tunnels. Since June of last year, more and more tunnel fortifications have been built on the enemy's positions. On many positions, three or four semi-connected and fully connected tunnels have been built. However, the operations in March proved that our army not only has the strength and the means to capture enemy positions built with such strong fortifications, but also can resist the enemy's frantic counterattacks on the newly captured positions, killing and wounding a large number of enemy soldiers.

The combined main achievements of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in March are as follows (incomplete statistics):

　　1. A total of 15,577 enemy soldiers were eliminated, including 8,253 U.S. soldiers, 448 Colombian soldiers, 299 Belgian soldiers, 1 Philippine soldier, and 6,576 Rhee Syngman puppet soldiers.

　　2. Main Captures: one 60mm mortar, two recoilless rifles, nine 90mm rocket launchers, one flamethrower, 51 heavy and light machine guns each, 653 automatic rifles, carbines, and pistols, two signal guns, two radios, and 57 various communication devices.

　　3. Ground anti-aircraft artillery and air force units shot down 99 enemy aircraft, damaged 172 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 45 enemy tanks, 51 various artillery pieces, 106 vehicles, damaged one enemy destroyer, and sunk one enemy minesweeper and two wooden boats.

    朝中人民军队取得新胜利
    三月份歼敌一万五千多名
    毁伤敌机二百七十一架、坦克四十五辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】朝鲜战争进入第三个春季，朝中人民军队在作战中取得了新的胜利。三月份朝鲜前线的战斗比冬季任何一个月的战斗都要频繁和激烈。朝中人民军队全月共作战二百二十七次，歼灭敌军一万五千五百七十七名，比二月份增多五千九百九十九名。其中美国侵略军死伤八千二百五十三名，超过了李伪军的伤亡数字。
    三月份中，朝鲜前线发生过四次规模较大的战斗：一次在东线，三次在西线。西线三次激烈的阵地争夺战，是去年冬初上甘岭战役以来最激烈的战斗。在每次战斗中，美国侵略军及其帮凶军都受到了沉重的打击。
    三月初，东线我军一举攻占金城以东官岱里西南山李伪军第六师两个排的阵地，守敌受到打击后大部逃进坑道。自三日黄昏以后，我军与敌人援军展开了一天两夜的争夺战，打退了敌人一个排到一个营兵力的十多次反扑。到十三日，我军完成歼敌任务后主动回到自己的阵地。这次战斗共歼敌四百六十多名。三月下旬西线的三次阵地争夺战，是一次紧接着一次进行的，并且一次比一次激烈。二十一日夜里，我军反击高浪浦里以北坪村南山，歼灭美军第二师一个排大部，并击退敌人一个连援军的五次反扑。二十三日夜里，在涟川西北上浦防东山——“老秃山”上开始了另外一次争夺战。我军攻占了这座山岭，将帮凶军哥伦比亚营一个加强连全部歼灭，以后又在这个山岭上顽强抗击美军第七师五个多营兵力的连续反扑。这个仅有一平方公里面积的小山岭上，每日平均落炮弹两万发以上，落炸弹一百多枚。但我军始终未让敌人再踏上这座山岭。在历时四天四夜的激烈的争夺战斗中，我军共歼敌一千七百多名。二十六日夜里我军反击高浪浦里西北梅岘里东山和马踏里西山美海军陆战队第一师的两个阵地，当夜即将守敌三个加强排和一个运输班全部歼灭。在这天以后，我军步兵和炮兵密切协同作战，给予疯狂反扑的敌人以重大杀伤，到三月底为止，共歼敌一千二百多名。
    三月份除了上述四次争夺战以外，我军在全线还先后进行了四十八次反击战和袭击战，我军在这些反击战和袭击战中，成建制地歼灭了美军十一个整排、五个整班和四个排的大部，哥伦比亚军一个加强连，李伪军一个整连、三个整排、六个整班和一个排大部。
    敌人在三月份向我军阵地攻击、袭击共达六十九次。他们遭到了大批伤亡，没有能够向前推进一步。十日那天，美军第七师的两个连向西线涟川西北上浦防东山附近我军的一个阵地发动攻击，从早晨一直攻到天黑，并且向这座小山头发射炮弹一万多发，最后还是在伤亡了一百五十多人后垂头丧气地退却了。
    敌人阵地上的工事，经过一年多时间的构筑和增修，是相当坚固的。如在上浦防东山这个只有一平方公里的山岭上，敌人筑有大小明暗地堡二百多个，平均约距五、六公尺就有一个地堡；地堡顶上盖铁板、木料，和厚厚的积土。此外，敌人还修了地下坑道。自去年六月以来，敌人阵地上修成的坑道工事越来越多，在许多阵地上已修成半通的和全通的坑道三、四条。但是三月份的作战证明，我军不仅有力量、有办法攻下筑有这样强固工事的敌军阵地，而且能够在刚攻占的阵地上抗击敌人疯狂的反扑，杀伤大量的敌人。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军三月份综合主要战绩如下（不完全统计）：
    一、共计歼灭敌军一万五千五百七十七名，其中包括美军八千二百五十三名，哥伦比亚军四百四十八名，比利时军二百九十九名，菲律宾军一名，李伪军六千五百七十六名。
    二、主要缴获：六零炮一门、无后座力炮二门，九零火箭筒九具，火焰喷射器一具，重机枪、轻机枪各五十一挺，自动步枪、卡宾枪、短枪等六百五十三枝，讯号枪二枝，电台二部，各种通话机五十七部。
    三、地面高射炮火及空军部队共击落敌机九十九架，击伤敌机一百七十二架，击毁击伤敌军坦克四十五辆，各种火炮五十一门，汽车一百零六辆，击伤敌军驱逐舰一艘，击沉敌扫雷艇一艘，木船两只。
