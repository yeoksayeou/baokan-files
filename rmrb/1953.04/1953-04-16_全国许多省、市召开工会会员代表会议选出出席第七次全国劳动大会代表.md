The delegates elected from various regions include figures from all walks of life, with broad representation.

Before the elections, all regions earnestly discussed the resolutions of the Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the Sixth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the significance of convening the Seventh National Labor Congress. For example, before electing these representatives, the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions repeatedly publicized the great significance of the Seventh National Labor Congress to the broad masses of workers, so the workers were very serious and cautious about this election. In Shenyang, the workers in various factories and enterprises extensively and conscientiously discussed the candidates proposed by various industrial systems before the election. During the election, the trade union member representatives attending the meeting also carefully reviewed all the candidates, organized by industrial system. In order to make the Seventh National Labor Congress a success, the Baotou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has arranged for the work of collecting proposals for the congress.
