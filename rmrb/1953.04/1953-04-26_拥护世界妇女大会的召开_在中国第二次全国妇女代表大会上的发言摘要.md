Comrade Lu Cui, Head of the International Liaison Department, All-China Democratic Women's Federation.

The Women's International Democratic Federation has decided to convene the World Women's Congress in Denmark from June 5th to 12th, 1953. The agenda of the congress includes the following three items:

(1) To fight for and defend the rights of women as mothers, workers, and citizens;

(2) The achievements and future tasks of the international women's movement for the defense of peace and the protection of women and children;

(3) Re-election of the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation.

According to the charter of the Women's International Democratic Federation, an international women's congress should be convened every three years. This upcoming congress is called the World Women's Congress, with the aim of making the participants more broadly representative. In addition to the member organizations of the Women's International Democratic Federation, all women's organizations that love peace and advocate for the protection of the rights of women and children, women members of other mass organizations, and the vast number of unorganized women are welcome to participate, so that this congress can truly become a congress representing women from different countries, different nationalities, different lifestyles, different classes, different professions, and different political views and religious beliefs around the world. The aim is to further expand the international women's united front for defending world peace and protecting women and children and to further strengthen the international women's democratic movement through this congress.

The Women's International Democratic Federation has already sent invitations to women in 94 countries, and the preparatory work for the congress is being enthusiastically carried out in many countries.

In the current situation, the convening of this World Women's Congress is of great significance.

The most prominent aspect of the current international situation is that the war and aggression policies of the U.S. government are universally threatening the peace and security of the people of all countries in Asia and around the world. Not to mention the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, who are directly ravaged by the war of aggression, even in the countries of the aggressive bloc itself, in the countries that are so-called "allies" of the United States, the living conditions of the vast majority of people have deteriorated significantly due to the rulers of these countries succumbing to the orders of the United States and implementing policies of arms expansion and war preparation. Taxes have increased, prices have soared, living standards have declined sharply, and the number of unemployed has continued to increase. In the United States itself, only the American monopoly capitalists have made huge fortunes from the policies of arms expansion and war preparation, while the vast majority of American working people are living in increasingly difficult conditions. The cost of living has increased more than twofold compared to 1939, and the number of fully unemployed and semi-unemployed has reached 13 million. By the end of 1952, the United States had suffered 320,000 casualties in the war of aggression against Korea. This is the disaster that the war policy of the U.S. government has brought to the American people. In colonies and dependencies, the suffering of the people is even more severe. In addition to intensifying economic plunder of the people there, the United States and its accomplices are using their land as military bases and driving their people onto the Korean battlefield or preparing them as cannon fodder for future wars.

Faced with such an increasingly serious threat of war, tens of millions of people around the world are increasingly rising up to fight against war, for peace, and to defend their right to survival. The people's movement to defend peace on a world scale is continuing to develop and grow, and will become a force that determines the future of the world.

The international women's democratic movement, under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation, is a part of the world people's movement for the defense of peace. It has already united 135 million women in 65 countries in its ranks, which is unprecedented in the history of the women's movement. However, it cannot be denied that in capitalist countries, in colonies and dependencies, there are still many kind women who long for peace but have not yet actually participated in the peace movement. Faced with the growing threat of war, the main task of the Women's International Democratic Federation is to use all means to expand the united front of the international women's movement and attract the broadest masses of women from all countries around the world to the great movement for the defense of peace. The convening of the World Women's Congress and the extensive preparatory work being carried out for the congress is an important step taken to accomplish this task.

In the agenda of the World Women's Congress, the issue of striving for and defending women's rights is placed in a very important position. This is based on the following practical situation: in all capitalist countries and colonial dependencies, women have not obtained the rights they deserve in political, economic, and social aspects. Take the United States, which boasts of "democracy," as an example. American women nominally obtained the right to vote in 1920, but in reality, due to various restrictions on the right to vote—such as residency requirements, education level, and property qualifications—millions of American working men and women are in fact deprived of the right to vote. This situation is particularly serious for black people. According to statistics from the New York Civil Rights Congress, in the United States, at least eight million black men and women are deprived of the right to vote due to racial discrimination and the inability to pay poll taxes. In the United States, the phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work between men and women workers is serious. In some capitalist countries, such as Switzerland, women do not even have the right to vote in form, and the law does not recognize the principle of equal pay for equal work. As for colonies and dependencies, under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism, women are fundamentally deprived of all rights. For example, in the British Commonwealth of South Africa, women of color have no political rights whatsoever. In Iran, Article 10 of the election law explicitly stipulates that "women, children, and lunatics have no right to vote." In all colonies and dependencies, the principle of equal pay for equal work simply does not exist, and there is no social legislation to protect women. We know that only in the socialist Soviet Union, in our People's Republic of China, and in the people's democratic countries, do women enjoy full rights; these rights are not only guaranteed by law, but the state also creates all the conditions that enable women to actually exercise these rights.

In capitalist countries and colonies and dependencies, the reactionary rulers' implementation of policies of arms expansion and war preparation results in the deepest suffering for women and children. For example, due to frantic war preparations, peaceful industries have suffered a great crisis. According to the materials of the Second Congress of the International Textile and Garment Workers' Union last October, in the United States alone, 249,000 textile and garment workers were laid off in 1951. Seventy-five percent of textile workers in France are unemployed, and 132,000 textile workers in Japan are also unemployed. Among textile and garment workers, 70 to 80 percent are women, so it goes without saying that this situation is a particularly serious blow to the working women of these countries. Many unemployed mothers, forced by life, have to sell their own children to exchange for food rations. In Japan, 300,000 children were sold in 1951, some with a value equal to only 35 to 70 catties of rice! Most of the girls were sold to be semi-prostitute maids or directly to brothels. In colonies and dependencies that have already been exploited to extreme poverty, the lives of women and children are even more precarious. For example, in French Morocco, the child mortality rate is as high as 75 percent. These facts show that women and children are deprived of or threatened with even the most basic right to survival.

The broad masses of women in these countries are becoming increasingly aware and taking action to fight for and defend their due rights, and to fight for and defend the rights of their children to survival, health, and education. Their struggle is completely just and should be supported by all progressive people around the world.

In this situation, the Women's International Democratic Federation and its member organizations bear a particularly important responsibility, which is: to mobilize, organize, and unite the broad masses of women, starting from the most immediate interests of the broad masses of women, to fight for the protection of the special interests of women and children, and to fight for and defend the rights of women as mothers, workers, and citizens; and through this struggle, to educate the broad masses of women, so that they realize that the struggle for women's rights and the protection of women and children is inseparable from the struggle to defend peace, thereby further attracting them to the great movement for the defense of peace—this is the basic task of the Women's International Democratic Federation at present.

From this, it can be seen that the purpose of convening the World Women's Congress is completely in line with the interests of women all over the world, and therefore, it is also in line with the interests of Chinese women.

Our Chinese women, under the long-term patriotic and internationalist education of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, deeply understand that building the motherland and defending world peace are two inseparable and glorious tasks. The war of Japanese aggression against China in the past and the anti-people civil war launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries have caused countless sufferings to our Chinese women. Therefore, we deeply know the value of peace. Now that the revolution has triumphed, in order to build our prosperous motherland and to create our happy life, we need even more a peaceful environment to engage in peaceful construction. We love peace and wholeheartedly support the cause of world people in defending peace. The convening of the World Women's Congress is conducive to the cause of defending world peace, and therefore, we should warmly support it.

Similarly, we deeply understand that the Chinese women's movement is closely linked to the entire international women's democratic movement. That is to say, the struggle and victory of women in any country supports us, and every struggle and victory of ours also supports them.

It is well known how the shining example of Soviet women has inspired our Chinese women to move forward, and inspired women all over the world to move forward. The complete liberation of Soviet women has pointed out the path to liberation for Chinese women and for women all over the world. Conversely, the struggle and victory of our Chinese women, as well as every struggle and victory of women in any country in the world, directly or indirectly supports Soviet women, and supports their great cause of defending peace and building communism.

Taking the current examples of Korea and China, the heroic struggle of the Korean people and Korean women not only defends their own motherland, but also defends the peaceful life of our Chinese women and children. We Chinese women thank Korean women for their support to us. Conversely, we also support them with the vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Every bumper harvest of our Chinese peasant women on their own land, and every achievement of female workers in factories in increasing production and practicing economy, is also a support for Korean women and a contribution to world peace.

Similarly, the lives of Japanese women and their struggles are also closely related to us. Because, today, the American imperialists and Japanese reactionary rulers who are oppressing and trampling on Japanese women are also the main enemies of our Chinese women. The rearmament of Japan directly threatens our peaceful life and threatens our peaceful construction. If the women, who account for half of the Japanese population, unite as one, resolutely refuse to let their husbands and sons become soldiers again, and resolutely demand that the Americans get out of Japan, this will undoubtedly have a significant meaning for defending peace in Asia and the world.

To go further, whether it is in the Americas across the Pacific, or in distant Africa, no matter which country, as long as there are women fighting for peace, for independence, and for a happy life, this struggle is directly related to our Chinese women. Because our interests are originally common, our enemies are also common, and our struggles and their struggles support each other.

War instigators, the enemies of mankind, they are most jealous of this relationship of mutual trust and mutual support between the people of all countries in the world, because they deeply know that this is what will ultimately lead them to death. Therefore, they use all shameless means to spread all kinds of lies and slanders, carry out provocation and division, and try to build barriers between people and people, and between women and women. Our task is to demolish these barriers, expose all lies, develop mutual understanding, mutual trust, and mutual support between people and people, and between women and women, and unite the strength of all people and women to fight for ensuring world peace, friendship between the people of all countries, and the happy life of women and children. The convening of the World Women's Congress is conducive to the forward progress of this cause, and therefore, we should warmly support it.

So, what should we do to support the World Women's Congress?

First of all, we will send a large delegation to participate in the Congress in order to participate in the various tasks of the Congress and make an effective contribution to achieving the tasks of the Congress. This delegation should be broadly representative, enough to fully demonstrate the scale of the great unity of women of all nationalities, all classes, all different professions and different political and religious beliefs in our country.

Secondly, we have a responsibility to publicize the news of the convening of the World Women's Congress and its significance to the broad masses of women cadres and the masses in China; after the delegation attends the Congress and returns to the country, we must widely convey the resolutions of the Congress in order to enhance the internationalist thinking of women cadres and the masses, and strengthen their understanding of international work. In the past four years, with the victory of the people's revolution in our country and the improvement of our country's international status, the international work of our All-China Women's Federation has also been increasingly carried out. At present, in addition to participating in the work of the Women's International Democratic Federation, we have also established contact with women in 53 countries, playing a certain role in uniting international friends and helping to expand and strengthen the international women's united front for peace and democracy. The convening of the World Women's Congress is a major event in the international women's movement this year, and it is also a major event in the international activities of our All-China Women's Federation this year. Therefore, it is necessary to launch publicity to the broad masses of women in the country, mobilizing the broad masses of women in our country to support the World Women's Congress and implement the resolutions of the World Women's Congress.

We must continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation, actively participate in the international women's democratic movement in a vanguard posture, unite with all peace-loving women around the world, and jointly strive for international peace and the happiness of women and children.

Chairman Mao earnestly instructed us at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite international friends, we will be forever victorious." Let us better implement Chairman Mao's instructions and do a good job in uniting international friends and defending world peace!

Long live the success of the World Women's Congress!

Long live the unity of women all over the world!

Long live world peace!

    拥护世界妇女大会的召开
    ——在中国第二次全国妇女代表大会上的发言摘要
    中华全国民主妇女联合会国际工作部部长  陆璀
    国际民主妇女联合会决定在一九五三年六月五日至十二日在丹麦召开世界妇女大会。大会的议程有如下三项：
    （一）为争取和保卫妇女们作为母亲、劳动者和公民的权利而斗争；
    （二）国际妇女保卫和平、保卫妇女儿童运动的成就和今后任务；
    （三）改选国际民主妇联的领导机构。
    按照国际民主妇女联合会的章程，应该每三年召集一次国际妇女代表大会。这一次召开的大会叫作世界妇女大会，目的是为了使这一次大会的参加者更加具有广泛的代表性。除了国际民主妇联的会员团体以外，还欢迎一切爱好和平、主张保护妇女儿童权利的妇女团体、其他群众团体的妇女会员以及广大的无组织的妇女都来参加，使这个大会真正成为代表全世界各个不同国家、不同民族、不同生活方式、不同阶层、不同职业、不同政治见解和宗教信仰的妇女大会，以便通过这次大会，进一步扩大保卫世界和平、保护妇女儿童的国际妇女统一战线，进一步加强国际妇女民主运动。
    国际民主妇联已经向九十四个国家的妇女发出邀请，大会的筹备工作正在许多国家里热烈展开。
    在目前形势之下，召开这个世界妇女大会，它的意义是很重大的。
    目前国际形势中最突出的一点，就是：美国政府的战争政策和侵略政策普遍地威胁着全亚洲和全世界各国人民的和平与安全。直接遭受到侵略战争蹂躏的朝鲜、越南、和马来亚的人民不用说了，就是在侵略集团本身，在美国所谓“盟友”的国家里，由于这些国家的统治者屈从于美国的命令，执行扩军备战的政策，也已使广大人民的生活条件大大恶化。赋税增加，物价飞涨，生活水平急遽下降，失业的数目不断地增加。在美国国内，也只有美国的垄断资本家从扩军备战的政策中大发了横财，而广大的美国劳动人民则生活一天比一天困苦。生活费比一九三九年上涨了两倍多，完全失业和半失业的达到了一千三百万人。到一九五二年年底为止，美国在侵朝战争中已经伤亡了三十二万人。这就是美国政府的战争政策所带给美国人民的灾难。在殖民地和附属国内，人民的灾难就更加深重。美国和它的帮凶们除了在经济上加紧掠夺那里的人民以外，还把他们的土地用来作军事基地，把他们的人民驱上朝鲜战场或准备作未来战争的炮灰。
    面临着这样日益严重的战争威胁，全世界千千万万的人民正在日益奋起，为反对战争、争取和平和保卫自己的生存权利而斗争。世界规模的人民保卫和平运动正在继续发展壮大，并将成为决定世界前途的一种力量。
    以国际民主妇女联合会为旗帜的国际妇女民主运动是世界人民保卫和平运动的一部分。在它的队伍里已经团结了六十五个国家的一亿三千五百万妇女，这在妇女运动的历史上是空前的。但是，不容否认，在资本主义国家里，在殖民地和附属国里，仍然有许多善良的渴望和平的妇女到今天还没有实际参加和平运动。面对着日益增长的战争威胁，国际民主妇联的主要任务，便是用一切办法，扩大国际妇女运动的统一战线，吸引全世界各国最广泛的千百万妇女群众到伟大的保卫和平运动中来。召开世界妇女大会以及为召开大会而进行的广泛的筹备工作，便是为达成这一任务而采取的一个重要步骤。
    在世界妇女大会的议程中，争取与保卫妇女权利问题是放在很重要的地位，这是从下面这种实际情况出发的：在所有资本主义国家和殖民地附属国里，妇女在政治、经济、社会各方面，都没有获得她们应有的权利。拿自诩“民主”的美国来说，美国妇女名义上已经在一九二○年获得了选举权，但是在实际上，由于对选举权的各种限制——如居住条件、教育程度、财产资格等，使美国千百万男女劳动人民在事实上被剥夺了选举权。这一情况在黑人方面尤其严重。据纽约公民权利大会的统计，在美国，至少有八百万黑人男女由于种族歧视和无力缴纳人头税而被剥夺了选举权。在美国，男女工人同工不同酬的现象严重存在。在有些资本主义国家里，如瑞士，妇女连形式上的选举权也没有，法律也不承认同工同酬的原则。至于在殖民地和附属国里，那末，在帝国主义和封建主义的双重压迫下，妇女根本被剥夺了一切权利。例如在英属南非联邦，有色人种的妇女任何政治权利都没有。在伊朗，选举法的第十条公开规定：“妇女、儿童和疯子无选举权”。在所有殖民地和附属国里，同工同酬的原则是根本不存在的，更没有任何的社会立法来保护妇女。我们知道，只有在社会主义的苏联，在我们中华人民共和国，在各人民民主国家，妇女们才享有充分的权利；这种权利不单有法律的保障，而且国家还给妇女们创造了使她们能够在实际上运用这些权利的一切条件。
    在资本主义国家和殖民地、附属国里，反动统治者执行扩军备战的政策的结果，受难最深的是妇女和儿童。举例来说：由于疯狂备战，和平工业遭到了极大的危机。据去年十月纺织服装工人工会国际第二次代表大会的材料，在美国，单一九五一年被解雇的纺织与服装工人就有二十四万九千人。法国的纺织工人有百分之七十五失业，日本亦有十三万二千纺织工人失业。在纺织与服装工人中，百分之七十到八十是女工，因此，不言而喻，这一情况对于这些国家的劳动妇女是特别严重的打击。许多失业的母亲为生活所迫，只好出卖自己亲生的儿女来换取口粮。在日本，一九五一年有三十万儿童被出卖，有的身价只等于三十五斤到七十斤米！女孩子大半被卖去作半卖淫的侍女或直接卖到妓院去。在原来已被剥削到极度贫困的殖民地附属国里，妇女儿童的生活更加濒于绝境。例如在法属摩洛哥，儿童死亡率高达百分之七十五。这些事实说明，妇女和儿童连最起码的生存权利都被剥夺或受到了威胁。
    这些国家里的广大的妇女正在日益觉悟起来，并且采取行动，为争取和保卫她们自己应有的权利，为争取和保卫她们的孩子们的生存、健康和受教育的权利而斗争。她们的斗争是完全正义的，应该得到全世界一切进步人类的支持。
    在这种情况下，国际妇联和它的会员团体肩负着特别重大的责任，这就是：必须从广大妇女最切身的利益出发，来动员、组织、和团结广大的妇女群众，为保护妇女儿童的特殊利益，为争取与保卫妇女们作为母亲、劳动者和公民的权利而斗争；并通过这个斗争，来教育广大的妇女，使她们认识到争取妇女权利与保护妇女儿童的斗争和保卫和平的斗争是不可分割的，从而进一步吸引她们到伟大的保卫和平运动中来——这正是国际民主妇联当前的基本任务。
    由此可知，世界妇女大会召开的目的，是完全符合于全世界妇女的利益的，因此，也符合于我中国妇女的利益。
    我们中国妇女长期在毛主席和中国共产党的爱国主义与国际主义教育下，深深懂得建设祖国与保卫世界和平是不可分割的两大光荣任务。过去日本侵略中国的战争和国民党反动派发动的反人民的内战，曾经使我们中国妇女受过数不清的苦难，因此，我们深深知道和平的可贵。现在革命胜利了，为了建设我们繁荣的祖国，为了创造我们的幸福生活，我们更需要一个和平的环境来从事和平建设。我们热爱和平，衷心拥护世界人民保卫和平的事业。世界妇女大会的召开是有利于保卫世界和平的事业的，因此，我们应该热烈的拥护它。
    同样，我们深深懂得，中国的妇女运动，是和整个国际妇女民主运动紧密联系在一起的。这就是说，任何一个国家里妇女的斗争和胜利都支援了我们，而我们的每一个斗争和胜利也都支援了她们。
    人所共知，苏联妇女的光辉榜样是如何的鼓舞了我们中国妇女前进，鼓舞了全世界妇女前进。苏联妇女的彻底解放给中国妇女也给全世界妇女指出了解放的道路。反过来，我们中国妇女的斗争和胜利，以及全世界任何一个国家妇女的每一个斗争和胜利也就直接或间接地支持了苏联妇女，支持了她们保卫和平、建设共产主义的伟大事业。
    拿眼前朝鲜和中国的例子来说，朝鲜人民和朝鲜妇女的英勇斗争不仅保卫着他们自己的祖国，同时也保卫着我们中国妇女儿童的和平生活。我们中国妇女感谢朝鲜妇女对我们的支持。反过来，我们也以轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动支持了她们。我们中国的农妇们在自己土地上的每一次丰收，女工们在工厂里每一项增产节约的成就，也都是对朝鲜妇女的支援和对世界和平的贡献。
    同样，日本妇女的生活和她们的斗争也和我们息息相关。因为，今天在压迫和蹂躏日本妇女的美帝国主义者和日本反动统治者也正是我们中国妇女的主要的敌人。日本的重新武装直接威胁着我们的和平生活，威胁着我们的和平建设，如果占日本人口一半的妇女一致起来，坚决不让她们的丈夫和儿子再去当兵，坚决要求美国人滚出日本去，这对于保卫亚洲和世界的和平无疑将有重大的意义。
    再推远一些说，不论是在太平洋彼岸的美洲，或是在遥远的非洲，不论是在那一个国家，只要那里有妇女在为和平、为独立、为幸福生活而斗争，这斗争就与我们中国妇女直接有关。因为我们的利益原是共同的，我们的敌人也是共同的，我们的斗争和她们的斗争互相支援。
    战争挑拨者，人类的敌人，他们最嫉视全世界各国人民之间的这种互相信任与互相支持的关系，因为他们深知，就是这一点，将最后致他们于死亡。因此，他们使尽一切无耻的手段，散布各种谎言和诽谤，进行挑拨离间，力图在人民与人民间，妇女与妇女间，筑起一道道的藩篱来。我们的任务就是要拆毁这些藩篱，揭破一切谎话，发展人民与人民、妇女与妇女之间的互相了解、互相信任和互相支持，团结起一切人民和妇女的力量，为确保世界的和平、各国人民之间的友好和妇女儿童的幸福生活而斗争。世界妇女大会的召开是有利于这一事业的向前推进的，因此，我们应该热烈地拥护它。
    那末，为了拥护世界妇女大会，我们应该做些什么呢：
    首先，我们将派遣一个大的代表团前往参加大会，以便参加大会的各项工作，并对达成大会的任务方面作有效的贡献。这个代表团应该具有广泛代表性，足以充分显示我国各民族、各阶层、各种不同职业与不同政治宗教信仰的妇女大团结的规模。
    其次，我们有责任把世界妇女大会召开的消息及其意义向中国的广大妇女干部和群众进行宣传；在代表团出席大会返国后，更要把大会的决议进行广泛传达，以提高妇女干部和群众的国际主义思想，并加强她们对国际工作的认识。四年来，随着我国人民革命的胜利和我国国际地位的提高，我全国妇联的国际工作也日益开展。目前我们除参加国际民主妇联的工作外，还已经和五十三个国家的妇女建立了联系，在团结国际友人、帮助扩大与加强国际妇女和平民主统一战线方面，起了一定的作用。世界妇女大会的召开，是本年内国际妇女运动中的一件大事，也是我全国妇联本年度国际活动中的一件大事。因此，必须展开对国内广大妇女群众的宣传，动员我国广大妇女拥护世界妇女大会并执行世界妇女大会的决议。
    我们要继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，并在国际民主妇联的旗帜下，以先锋队的姿态，积极参加国际妇女民主运动，与全世界一切爱好和平的妇女团结一致，共同为争取国际和平和妇女儿童的幸福而斗争。
    毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全体会议上谆谆指示我们说：“只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就会是永远胜利的。”让我们更好地执行毛主席的指示，做好团结国际友人、保卫世界和平的工作吧！
    世界妇女大会成功万岁！
    全世界妇女团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
