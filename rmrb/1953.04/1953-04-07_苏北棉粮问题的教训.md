Lessons from the Grain and Cotton Problem in Northern Jiangsu
Xu Wen

From October to December last year, the phenomenon of hundreds and thousands of people queuing to sell cotton and buy grain occurred successively in northern Jiangsu. Some pregnant women miscarried because of the jostling to buy grain. Some cotton farmers in some areas, unable to sell cotton and buy grain immediately, cursed the cooperatives, beat cadres, and complained about the government, causing serious chaos. Although the grain supply and cotton purchase work in northern Jiangsu has improved since then, the lessons learned from this chaotic phenomenon are worth remembering deeply.

In 1952, the cotton planting policy in northern Jiangsu was to strive to increase the yield per unit area based on the planting area in 1951. Northern Jiangsu purchased a total of 950,000 dan of cotton in 1951, but purchased 1,210,000 dan in 1952, which still failed to meet the cotton farmers' requirements for selling cotton. In 1951, the grain company sold 187.9 million jin of grain in northern Jiangsu, and 606.89 million jin in 1952. That is to say, the amount of cotton purchased and the amount of grain supplied in northern Jiangsu in 1952 were both greater than in 1951, but why couldn't they still meet the farmers' demands for selling cotton and buying grain?

First of all, this is because the cotton-grain price ratio was not entirely reasonable, and the cotton price was too high, which stimulated cotton farmers to blindly expand the cotton planting area. Many farmers were very interested in "one jin of cotton for eight and a half jin of rice," so they changed fields for growing grain to growing cotton. For example, farmers in Puan Township, Jingjiang County, changed more than 1,300 mu of grain fields (more than one-third of the township's total field acreage) to cotton. In cotton-grain intercropping areas and Huaiyin Prefecture, which is not very suitable for cotton planting, farmers also automatically expanded a lot of cotton fields. In 1951, the total cotton field area in northern Jiangsu was 4.5 million mu. According to the existing statistics of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, it had expanded to 5,384,400 mu in 1952. Dongtai County originally planned to plant 210,000 mu of cotton, but actually planted 320,000 mu. So far, the sentiment of expanding cotton planting area still exists in some areas. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry recently received a letter from He Yongde mutual aid group in Tongjing Township, Tenth District, Jiangning County, dated March 20, saying:

    "Our group plans to plant more than six times as much cotton this year as last year. We hope that your department will provide more technical guidance." The suburbs of Zhenjiang planted 600 to 700 mu of cotton last year, but are preparing to plant 1,500 to 1,600 mu this year.

Due to the blind expansion of cotton field area, the area for growing grain shrank, and coupled with the poor grain harvest in northern Jiangsu last year, the supply of grain needed to be greatly increased. In addition, because cash crops and some by-products were very valuable, farmers could buy back the industrial products they needed without selling grain; and because wheat seedlings were damaged by frost, farmers planned to store grain for famine, so they were unwilling to sell grain. Therefore, in 1952, the northern Jiangsu grain company only completed 60% of its miscellaneous grain purchase task, and only 80% of its rice purchase plan. However, the supply task far exceeded that of 1951. In 1951, the northern Jiangsu grain company sold 22.21 million jin of wheat, but in 1952 it sold 96.51 million jin. In 1951, 58,560 bags of flour were sold, but in 1952, 86,900 bags were sold. In 1951, 18.79 million jin of rice were sold, but in 1952, 60.689 million jin were sold. As a result, northern Jiangsu experienced the phenomenon of sluggish sales in the off-season and sluggish purchases in the peak season last year. When a place ran out of grain, it quickly spread to the entire northern Jiangsu region. People rushed to wherever there was grain. In Baipu Town, Nantong County, a phenomenon of 10,000 people搶購ing grain occurred. Because the masses became nervous about grain, many disguised hoarding households appeared. Farmers in Huaiyin sold cattle, and farmers in Jingjiang sold immature bamboo and trees to hoard grain. Some cotton farmers bought their entire year's ration at once. At this time, private merchants took the opportunity to make trouble. In addition to the original grain dealers, many fishmongers and vegetable vendors switched to selling grain. The distilleries in Jingjiang County invited two or three tables of people to eat at home every day, specifically to buy grain for them. In cotton-grain intercropping areas, the expansion of cotton fields increased the chaos in grain supply because farmers needed to buy grain to pay public grain. The increase in pigs in northern Jiangsu also put pressure on the grain supply. In the first half of 1951, Haian County raised 50,000 pigs, which developed to 130,000 in the second half of the year, and increased to 190,000 in the autumn of 1952. Rugao County increased by 100,000 pigs in 1952 compared with 1951. Each fat pig eats 500 jin of miscellaneous grain per year, and Rugao County alone needs to increase the supply of 50 million jin of miscellaneous grain compared with 1951.

Some local Party and government leading organs did not have a thorough understanding of agricultural production, and did not investigate the problem in time, thus causing blindness in their work. Last year, the cotton seedlings in northern Jiangsu suffered from typhoon disasters, and red spiders also harmed them for a while, which is a fact. However, no cadre at any level actually investigated the actual situation of the cotton seedlings being damaged, and repeatedly shouted "reduced production" to the higher authorities. In fact, there were not many areas where cotton production was reduced last year. The relevant leading organs did not fully know these situations. When they formulated the cotton purchase plan, they were once worried that they would not be able to complete the task, and repeatedly wanted to reduce the purchase figures. As a result, the actual situation was the opposite. For three years, the production figures mastered by the agricultural and forestry departments have lagged behind the purchase figures. The actual cotton harvest in 1950 exceeded the production figure by 10%; the actual harvest in 1951 exceeded the production figure by 40,000 dan; the difference between the figures in 1952 was even greater: the Department of Agriculture and Forestry reported that the cotton output of Binhai County was 48,654 dan, while the county's cooperative purchased 55,870 dan, estimating that farmers still had 10% of the cotton in storage. Similar situations are numerous. This situation has not attracted the attention of the leadership, and the purchase plan for 1952 was still determined according to the figures of the agricultural and forestry departments.

The purchasing departments did not pay enough attention to the purchasing work in 1952. They believed that with the experience of 1951, there would be no problem in completing the task in 1952. However, they only planned to purchase 231,000 dan in October, and actually purchased more than 304,000 dan. They were still only considering "completing the task" and gloated over "over-fulfilling the task." They did not think much about what problems would occur if they "could not collect" enough. They only knew how to weigh and collect cotton, but did not carry out the necessary organizational mobilization work and develop necessary and possible savings business.

The lack of ideological unity among various departments, the lack of coordination, and the emphasis on their own departmental business aggravated this chaotic phenomenon. At the beginning of the cotton purchase, the company, the cooperative, and the bank did not study well how much funds to put in and how to recover currency, but each engaged in its own business. After the problem occurred, the departments distrusted each other and complained about each other. The cooperative said that the production figures of the agricultural and forestry departments were not accurate and the plan was made too small; the agricultural and forestry departments said that the cotton, yarn, and cloth company estimated too much civilian cotton; the cotton, yarn, and cloth company said that the cooperative and the grain company's purchases and supplies were unplanned. This situation also exists in the business and planning departments of the same unit. Some business departments found that the actual situation was inconsistent with the plan and told the planning department, but the planning department did not consider it and was satisfied with sitting at home to count the forms reported layer by layer. The business departments were also often not serious enough about the implementation of the plan.

In March this year, Guan Wenwei, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, has made arrangements at the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, requiring various departments to carefully understand the situation, be well-informed, and ensure the completion of the task of increasing grain production in 1953.

    苏北棉粮问题的教训
    徐文
    苏北在去年十月到十二月间，曾先后发生成百成千的人排着队卖棉花、买粮食的现象。有的孕妇因为挤着买粮食而流产了。有部分地区的棉农，因为一下卖不掉棉花，买不到粮食，就骂合作社，打干部，埋怨政府，造成了严重的混乱现象。后来苏北地区的粮食供应工作和棉花收购工作虽然已经有了改进，但造成这种混乱现象的教训是值得深刻记取的。
    一九五二年苏北的植棉方针，是在一九五一年种植面积的基础上，争取提高单位面积产量。苏北一九五一年共收购棉花九十五万担，但一九五二年收购了一百二十一万担，还未能满足棉农出售棉花的要求。一九五一年粮食公司在苏北出售粮食一亿八千七百九十万斤，一九五二年出售了六亿零六百八十九万斤。这就是说，苏北一九五二年的棉花收购量和粮食供应量，都比一九五一年增大了，但为什么还不能满足农民售棉和购粮的要求呢？
    首先，这是因为棉粮比价不尽合理，棉价偏高，刺激棉农盲目扩大了棉田面积。许多农民对于“一斤棉花，八斤半大米”很感兴趣，就把种粮食的田改种了棉花。如靖江县普安乡农民曾把一千三百多亩粮田（占该乡总田亩数三分之一强）改种了棉花。在棉粮夹种地区和不很适宜种植棉花的淮阴专区，农民也自动扩大了很多棉田。一九五一年苏北棉田总面积是四百五十万亩，据江苏农林厅现有材料统计，一九五二年已扩大至五百三十八万四千亩。东台县原计划种棉二十一万亩，实际上却种了三十二万亩。到目前为止，扩大植棉面积的情绪在部分地区还存在着。江苏省农林厅最近还收到江宁县十区铜井乡何永德互助组三月二十日的来信说：
    “我们组里今年植棉面积，计划超过去年六倍多。希望贵厅多加技术指导。”镇江郊区去年种棉六、七百亩，今年却准备种一千五、六百亩。
    由于棉田面积的盲目扩大，种粮田面积就缩小了，加以去年苏北粮食歉收，粮食的供应量就更需要大大增加了。另外，农民由于经济作物和某些副产品很值钱，不卖粮食就可买回所需的工业用品；加以麦苗受冻，农民都作储粮备荒的打算，所以都不愿出卖粮食。因此，一九五二年苏北粮食公司的杂粮收购任务，只完成百分之六十，大米收购计划也只完成百分之八十。但供应任务却远超过了一九五一年。一九五一年苏北粮食公司销售小麦二千二百二十一万斤，一九五二年却销售了九千六百五十一万斤。一九五一年销售面粉五十八万五千六百袋，一九五二年却销售了八十六万九千袋。一九五一年销售大米一万八千七百九十万斤，一九五二年却销售了六万零六百八十九万斤。于是苏北去年就出现了粮食淡季销售不淡，旺季收购不旺的现象。一个地方粮食脱销，很快就波及到苏北全境。农民听到那里有粮就往那里赶。南通县白蒲镇曾发生万人抢购粮食的现象。由于群众对于粮食发生了紧张心理，就出现了很多变相囤积户。淮阴农民卖牛，靖江农民把未成熟的竹子和树卖掉，用来囤积粮食。有的棉农一下把全年的口粮都买好了。这时，私商乘机兴风作浪。除原有的粮贩以外，许多鱼贩、菜贩，都转业贩粮。靖江县的糟坊每天请二、三桌人在家吃饭，专门替他买粮。在棉粮夹种地区，因为扩大了棉田，农民需要买粮交公粮，也增加了粮食供应上的混乱现象。苏北地区的猪子增多，也加重了粮食供应工作的压力。海安县一九五一年上半年养猪五万头，到下半年就发展到十三万头，一九五二年秋天又增加到十九万头。如皋县一九五二年比一九五一年增加了十万口猪，每只肥猪每年吃五百斤杂粮，单如皋一县就需比一九五一年增加五千万斤杂粮的供应。
    有些地方党、政领导机关，对农业生产的不摸底，心中无数，发现问题不及时查清，因此造成工作上的盲目性。去年苏北的棉苗曾经遭受台灾，一度又有红蜘蛛为害，这是事实。但那一级干部都没有切实调查一下棉苗受害的实际情形，就一叠声地向上级喊“减产”；其实去年棉花减产的地区并不多。这些情况，有关领导机关并不完全知道，他们订棉花收购计划时，还一度担心不能完成任务，一再想缩小收购数字。结果实际情形却适得其反。三年以来，农林部门所掌握的生产数字都落后于收购数字。一九五零年的棉花实收数，超过生产数百分之十；一九五一年的实收数，超过生产数四万担，一九五二年的数字出入更大：农林厅报滨海县的棉花产量是四万八千六百五十四担，而该县合作社却收花五万五千八百七十担，估计农民还存棉百分之十。类似情形还很多。这种情形并未引起领导方面的重视，一九五二年的收购计划，还是按照农林部门的数字确定的。
    收购部门对一九五二年的收购工作也重视不够。他们认为有了一九五一年的经验，完成一九五二年的任务不会有问题。但十月份计划收二十三万一千担，实收了三十万零四千多担，他们还是仅仅考虑“完成任务”，并以“超额完成任务”而沾沾自喜。至于“收不了”会发生什么问题，却考虑得不多。他们只知道挂秤收花，但不去进行必要的组织动员工作，开展必要和可能的存实业务。
    各部门思想不一致，配合不够，各自强调部门业务，加重了这种混乱现象。开始收购棉花的时候，公司、合作社、银行对投放多少资金，怎样回笼货币，没有很好地加以研究，而是各搞各的业务。问题发生后，部门与部门之间互不信任，相互埋怨，合作社说农林部门的生产数字不确实，计划造小了；农林部门说花纱布公司把民用棉估计太多了；花纱布公司说合作社和粮食公司收购和供应无计划。这种情况，在同一单位的业务与计划部门也存在着。有些业务部门发现了实际情况与计划不符，告诉计划部门，而计划部门并不加以考虑，满足于坐在家里统计层层上报的表格，业务部门对执行计划也常常不够严肃。
    今年三月，江苏省人民政府副主席管文蔚同志，已在省财政经济委员会扩大会议上作了布置，要各部门认真摸清情况，做到心中有数，保证完成一九五三年的粮食增产任务。
