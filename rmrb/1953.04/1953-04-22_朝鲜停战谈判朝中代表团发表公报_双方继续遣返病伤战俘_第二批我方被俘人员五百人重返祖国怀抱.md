Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 20th: The Korean Armistice Talks Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communiqué on April 20th:

    In accordance with the "Agreement on Repatriation of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War" signed by both sides on April 11th, both sides began repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war at Panmunjom on April 20th.

    On April 20th, our side repatriated 50 sick and wounded prisoners of war of Korean nationality and 50 sick and wounded prisoners of war of non-Korean nationality to the other side. On the same day, the other side repatriated 400 sick and wounded prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and 100 sick and wounded prisoners of war of the Chinese People's Volunteers to our side.

    During the exchange process, our side divided the 100 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the other side into four groups and delivered them to the other side on time in accordance with the agreement. Along with each group of sick and wounded prisoners of war, our side also handed over a clear and accurate list to the other side. For the sick and wounded prisoners of war delivered to us by the other side on the same day, our side quickly completed the reception work after counting, disinfecting, and classifying them.

    Our sick and wounded prisoners of war, who had returned to the embrace of the motherland after a long and painful life in the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps, immediately received careful diagnosis and treatment and cordial condolences.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 21st: The Korean Armistice Talks Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communiqué on April 21st:

    On April 21st, both sides continued to repatriate sick and wounded prisoners of war at Panmunjom. Our side repatriated 50 sick and wounded prisoners of war of Korean nationality, 35 sick and wounded prisoners of war of American nationality, 12 sick and wounded prisoners of war of British nationality, and 3 sick and wounded prisoners of war of Turkish nationality to the other side, totaling 100 people. The other side repatriated 50 sick and wounded prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and 450 sick and wounded prisoners of war of the Chinese People's Volunteers to our side, totaling 500 people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 21st: Starting at 9:00 a.m. today, the second group of 450 repatriated Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war and 50 Korean People's Army prisoners of war, singing "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and "The East is Red," successively returned to the embrace of the motherland. In our reception area, a red colored placard written in both Korean and Chinese characters read "Embrace of the Motherland." The national flags of China and North Korea fluttered in the wind on all sides, welcoming the returning sons and brothers. The appearance of those repatriated today was even more miserable than yesterday. Almost all of them were skin and bones, with a sallow complexion. Many had both legs amputated, but the other side did not notify our side to prepare stretchers for them.

    Today, the windows of the other side's ambulances were covered with mud, and the mud was not yet dry when the cars arrived at our reception area. Today, the first group of People's Army prisoners of war began to sing songs of the motherland in loud voices as soon as they entered our reception area. After getting into our ambulances, they held the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which they had preserved for a long time in the American prisoner-of-war camps, out of the window. This faded and magnificent national flag symbolized the indomitable will of our captured personnel to return to the motherland.

    After the Volunteer Army prisoners of war got into our ambulances, they remembered the comrades who were massacred on Jeju Island last October 1st and the comrades who were still suffering in the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps, and could not help but cry bitterly. They sang the "October Red Flag Song," which they had composed themselves in the prisoner-of-war camps. This song commemorated the comrades who were massacred by the Americans on Jeju Island on October 1st last year. When they got out of the other side's ambulances, they angrily threw away the clothes that the other side had just given them. They said: "In the prisoner-of-war camps, they dressed us in rags. Only when we are about to leave do they take out these things to put on a show."

    Our captured personnel continued to suffer inhuman torture and abuse from the American side even during the repatriation journey. In the train from Busan to Munsan, two-thirds of the space in each carriage was occupied by American armed escorts. The place where our sick and wounded personnel were riding was very crowded, and many people could not lie down for a full twenty-eight hours. Today, some Volunteer Army sick and wounded prisoners of war threw out the stinking "meals" issued by the American side on the way when they got out of the American transport vehicles. The "rice" was a rice ball made of barley, rice, and broad beans, and the so-called "vegetables" were a few strands like grass, and some salty barley grains. They said: Because they really could not eat this kind of terrible pig-like food, they had been on hunger strike for three days, the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth, demanding improved treatment. One seriously ill Volunteer Army prisoner of war died on the way back because he could not eat the bad food, and the other side took bone marrow samples three times. After his death, our captured personnel requested that his body be transported back to the motherland, but the other side dispatched three armored vehicles and seventy fully armed American soldiers to snatch the body away.

    Today, our side again repatriated fifty sick and wounded prisoners of war of Korean nationality and fifty sick and wounded prisoners of war of non-Korean nationality from the other side. When the non-Korean prisoners of war left our reception area, they waved goodbye to our staff. Even those who were sleeping on stretchers stretched their hands out of the car windows. Their complexions looked very good, which was in stark contrast to the sallow and emaciated faces of our returning captured personnel.

    朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团发表公报
    双方继续遣返病伤战俘
    第二批我方被俘人员五百人重返祖国怀抱
    【新华社开城二十日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十日发表公报如下：
    根据四月十一日双方所签订的“遣返病伤被俘人员协定”，双方在四月二十日于板门店开始遣返病伤被俘人员。
    四月二十日，我方遣返给对方朝鲜籍和非朝鲜籍病伤被俘人员各五十名。同日，对方遣返给我方朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员四百名，中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员一百名。
    在双方遣交过程中，我方把一百名对方病伤被俘人员分四组，按照协议，准时送交对方。随着每组病伤被俘人员，我方并交与对方清楚无误的名单。对于对方在同日所送交我方的病伤被俘人员，我方经过清点、消毒和分类后，也迅速地完成了接收的工作。
    我方病伤被俘人员经过在对方战俘营中长期痛苦的生活而回到祖国的怀抱，立即受到细心的诊疗和亲切的慰问。
    【新华社开城二十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十一日发表公报如下：
    四月二十一日，双方继续在板门店遣返病伤被俘人员。我方遣返给对方朝鲜籍病伤被俘人员五十人，美国籍病伤被俘人员三十五人，英国籍病伤被俘人员十二人，土耳其籍病伤被俘人员三人，共一百人。对方则遣返给我方朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员五十人，中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员四百五十人，共五百人。
        【新华社开城二十一日电】今天上午九时起，第二批被遣返的四百五十位中国人民志愿军被俘人员和五十位朝鲜人民军被俘人员，在高唱“金日成将军之歌”和“东方红”的歌声中，陆续重返祖国怀抱。在我方接收区，红色的彩牌上用朝中两国文字写着“祖国怀抱”，四面朝中两国国旗，迎风招展，迎接归来的子弟。今天被遣返人员的样子比昨天的还要凄惨。他们几乎全是瘦骨嶙嶙，面有菜色。有不少人两腿都被锯掉，但对方并未通知我方为他们准备担架。
    今天对方救护车的窗子都用泥土涂住，车到我方接收区时泥土还没有干。今天第一组的人民军被俘人员刚进入我方接收区时，就高声唱起了祖国的歌曲。乘上我方救护车后，他们又把在美方战俘营中长期保存着的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗伸出窗外。这面褪了色的壮丽的国旗，象征着我方被俘人员重归祖国的不屈的意志。
    志愿军被俘人员坐进我方救护车后，他们想起了去年十月一日在济州岛被屠杀的同志和还在敌方战俘营里受苦的同志们，不禁痛哭起来。他们唱着他们在战俘营里自己编的“十月红旗歌”，这个歌子纪念去年十月一日在济州岛被美方屠杀的战友。他们在走下对方救护车时，都忿忿地丢掉对方刚刚发给他们的衣物。他们说：“在战俘营里给我们穿得破破烂烂，临走才拿出这些东西摆样子给人看。”
    我方被俘人员即使在美方遣返途中也备受美方非人道的折磨和虐待。由釜山到汶山的火车的每节车箱上，有三分之二的地位为美军武装押送人员所占。我方病伤人员乘坐的地方非常拥挤，有很多人整整坐了二十八小时，不能躺下。今天有一些志愿军病伤被俘人员在走下美方遣送车时，丢出美方在路上发给的发臭的“饭菜”。“饭”是大麦、米和蚕豆做成的饭团，而所谓“菜”则是几条像草一样的东西，和一些咸的大麦粒。他们说：因为实在吃不下这种恶劣的猪食一样的饭菜，他们十五、十六、十七日三天曾经绝食，要求改善待遇。有一位患重病的志愿军被俘人员因食物太坏吃不下，加上对方三次抽骨髓试验，而于遣返途中死去。在他死后，我方被俘人员要求把他的尸体运回祖国，但对方却出动了三辆装甲车和七十名全付武装的美军，把尸体抢走。
    今天我方又遣返了五十名朝鲜籍和五十名非朝鲜籍的对方病伤战俘。非朝鲜籍战俘离开我方接收区时，都向我方工作人员挥手告别，连睡在担架上的人也把手伸出车窗外。他们的脸色看来都很好，和归来的我方被俘人员的面黄肌瘦，成了一个鲜明的对照。
