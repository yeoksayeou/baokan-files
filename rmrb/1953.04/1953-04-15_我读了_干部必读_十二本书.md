I Read the Twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" Books
　　Wang Qixin
　　In the past two years, I used my spare time to read ten of the "Must-Read for Cadres" books. (The other two were studied two years ago.) I am a staff member of a university. As early as when the Party Central Committee stipulated that twelve books including the "Communist Manifesto" were "Must-Read for Cadres," I wanted to make a resolution to use my spare time to read them carefully once, to gain a relatively general understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory, and then to delve into them in a planned and step-by-step manner. Because I realized that the victory of the revolution has brought us new, more arduous, and more complex construction tasks. Only by conscientiously and systematically studying revolutionary theory and constantly improving our Marxist-Leninist theoretical level can we avoid or reduce mistakes, and be competent and successfully complete the work tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people. At the same time, only in this way can we constantly improve our class consciousness and be trained to become excellent revolutionary fighters. But at the beginning, I had concerns, thinking that I did not yet have a considerable level of education and theoretical understanding, and I was afraid that I would not be able to understand the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and at the same time, I was afraid that I would not have so much time. Therefore, although I had this idea, I did not start immediately.
　　In the autumn of 1949, I participated in the study of "Social Development History" arranged by the school administration. After the study of "Social Development History," I switched to studying "Political Economy." In the spring of 1951, due to other reasons, the school changed the original study plan, so "Political Economy" was stopped after only a few chapters. The study of basic Marxist-Leninist knowledge in this stage further improved my theoretical understanding of the revolution and became a starting point for my theoretical study. Since then, in addition to participating in the political theory study arranged by the administration, I started reading these twelve books from the "Communist Manifesto" in the order prescribed by the Party Central Committee, based on what I already knew.
　　In the course of these two years, except for the period of intense work during the "Three-Anti" movement and the period after the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" when I concentrated on reading the first and second volumes of the selected works, it can be said that I have not interrupted reading the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" books. I tried to take some time to read a dozen or dozens of pages almost every day. When I first started reading, I also felt some difficulties. The most important thing was that it was not easy to delve into it. Sometimes I had to read a passage several times to understand its meaning better. However, I was not intimidated by the difficulties. I often encouraged myself in this way: The work of revolutionary leaders is many times busier than ours. In addition to their tense work, they have also written many theoretical works for us, summarizing the experience of revolutionary struggles. Can't we even study what is readily available? After I read two or three books, I became extremely interested in them. The rich content in the books attracted me like magnetism, making me want to read them again after reading them. I felt that the writings of revolutionary teachers are not as profound and difficult to understand as some people say. As long as we study them conscientiously, our understanding can be gradually deepened. Although I have only read these twelve books once, I already feel that my theoretical understanding and class consciousness have been greatly improved.
　　In the process of reading, I further realized the importance of studying theory. Just as Comrade Stalin taught us: "Marxism is the Science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, the science of the building of communist society." (See "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics") Therefore, anyone who has mastered Marxist science is invincible. If we want to understand the laws of development of nature and society, build socialist and communist societies, and transform the bad habits and bad thoughts we brought from the old society, we must intensify our study and master Marxism-Leninism. These twelve books not only give us the weapons of Marxist-Leninist theory and strategy and tactics, enabling us to bypass all the reefs blocking our way forward and win the victory of the revolutionary struggle, but also provide the rich construction experience of the Soviet Union for more than 30 years as a model for us to learn from; they not only guide us in principle on how to carry out the construction of our motherland, but also give us specific methods for solving practical problems. I think that no matter what revolutionary work you are engaged in, as long as you are determined to study these twelve books, you can get many valuable instructions to improve and improve your work.
　　Our country is carrying out large-scale economic construction to gradually transform the backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country. This is an extremely arduous and extremely complex historical task. Without the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory, it is impossible to complete this glorious task at all. Its principles, steps, and theoretical basis, etc., should not only be clearly understood by leading cadres and economic workers of each country, but also by all state workers. The book "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" (one of the "Must-Read for Cadres") is a summary of Lenin and Stalin's theory and policies on building socialism, and also a summary of the rich experience of Soviet construction. For example, regarding the issue of implementing national industrialization, Comrade Stalin has repeatedly taught us: "The center of industrialization, its foundation, lies in the development of heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and ultimately, in the development of the production of the means of production, in the development of the country's machinery manufacturing industry." ("On Soviet Economic Forms and Party Policy") Because "only heavy industry can transform and revitalize the entire industry, transportation, and agriculture." If this is not done, "it cannot become an economically independent country." ("Summary of the First Five-Year Plan") Obviously, if it cannot be economically independent, it cannot consolidate national defense and protect the motherland from the enslavement of imperialism, nor can it continuously improve the people's material and cultural living standards. Only when we recognize these truths can we implement the policy of national key construction and overcome the idea of "everything waiting to be rebuilt," and successfully carry out our economic construction.
　　For another example, the current struggle against bureaucracy also gives us many valuable instructions in the works of Lenin and Stalin. These two revolutionary teachers taught us that "it must be understood that the struggle against bureaucracy is an absolutely necessary struggle" (Lenin: "The Political Activities of the Central Committee"), because "the danger of bureaucracy is, first of all, that bureaucracy buries and hides countless possibilities in our system, fails to use them, attempts to turn the creativity of the masses into nothing, confines it to the office, and turns every new initiative of the Party into petty and trivial greed. Second, the danger of bureaucracy is that bureaucracy cannot withstand the review of the implementation situation. It attempts to turn the main instructions of the leading organs into empty words on paper, completely divorced from real life. Not only are the old bureaucrats who are drilled in our organs dangerous, but the new bureaucrats and Soviet bureaucrats are also dangerous, and even more dangerous than the old bureaucrats." Therefore, we must "overthrow the bureaucracy in our organs and organizations, eliminate the 'morality' and 'habits' of bureaucracy, and clear the way to use the possibilities in our system and develop the creativity and independence of the masses." (Stalin: "Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee at the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party (Bolshevik)")
　　They not only told us to resolutely fight against bureaucracy, but also pointed out the methods of struggle. Comrade Stalin said that the struggle against bureaucracy, and the elimination of the "morality" and "habits" of bureaucracy, cannot be solved "all at once." "In the struggle against bureaucracy, the Party's work is carried out in four aspects: developing self-criticism, reviewing the degree of implementation of various tasks, cleaning up the organs, and promoting loyal staff from the working class from the bottom up to the organs." (Ibid.) From these instructions, we can understand the significance and methods of carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, and we can deeply realize the brilliance of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy.
　　The important significance of studying Marxism-Leninism is something that comrades will understand. However, some comrades may think that although these twelve books are "Must-Read for Cadres," they cannot find time to read them. Before reading, they may be daunted by the thick pile of books and wonder when they will be able to finish them. I also had this idea when I first started reading. But my experience proves that no matter how busy you are with work, as long as you are determined and scientifically allocate your time, you can completely persevere in your studies. Two years ago, someone calculated that the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" books have a total of 3,381 pages. If you read them carefully, reading ten pages for one hour a day, you can finish them in a year; reading five pages for half an hour a day, you can finish them in two years; if you plan to finish them in three years, you only need to read twenty minutes a day. Of course, to master all the theories in them is a long-term, lifelong career.
　　Time is very precious, and we should especially cherish it. Time runs very fast. If you relax a little, several tens of minutes will pass. If you seize the time and not let it be wasted in vain, and persist in learning for a long time, you will have great gains. In these two years, I have not affected my daily work because of studying "Must-Read for Cadres." On the contrary, it has promoted my daily work. Because through study, my ideological level has improved, and I love my work even more. It gives me more courage in my work to overcome difficulties, learn professional skills, and do my best to do my job well; when the interests of the individual conflict with the interests of the collective, I always try to overcome my personal plans in order to obey the needs of the overall revolution. In the future, I will continue to work hard to study, correct my shortcomings, improve my thinking, and do my job better.

### 我读了“干部必读”十二本书

    我读了“干部必读”十二本书
    王启新
    我在两年当中，利用业余时间读了“干部必读”的十本书。（其余两本是两年前学习的）我是一个高等学校的工作人员，早在党中央规定“共产党宣言”等十二本书为“干部必读”的时候，我就想下一个决心，利用业余时间比较细心地把它读完一遍，求得对马克思列宁主义理论有一个比较概括的了解，然后再有计划有步骤地深入钻研。因为我认识到革命的胜利，给我们带来了新的、更艰巨、更复杂的建设任务，只有认真地系统地学习革命理论，不断提高自己的马克思列宁主义理论水平，才能不犯或少犯错误，才能胜任和顺利地完成党和人民所交给自己的工作任务；同时，也只有这样，才能使自己不断提高阶级觉悟，锻炼成为一个优秀的革命战士。但是开始时我有顾虑，以为自己还没有具备相当的文化水平和理论水平，阅读马克思列宁主义的经典著作，恐怕啃不动，同时又怕没有这么多的时间。因此，虽有这种想法，并没有立即进行。
    一九四九年秋，我参加了学校行政所布置的“社会发展史”的学习，“社会发展史”的学习结束后，又转入学习“政治经济学”。一九五一年春，由于别的原因学校改变了原订的学习计划，所以
    “政治经济学”只学了几章就停止了。经过这一阶段马克思列宁主义基础知识的学习，使我进一步从理论上提高了对革命的认识，成为自己理论学习的一个开端。从此，我除了参加行政布置的政治理论学习外，便在已有的基础上，从“共产党宣言”起按照党中央规定的次序阅读这十二本书。
    在这两年多的过程中，除了“三反”运动工作紧张期间以及“毛泽东选集”出版后我集中精力读完第一、二两卷选集的期间之外，我读“干部必读”的十二本书可说是没有间断过，差不多每天都要抽出一点时间读十几页或几十页。刚开始阅读的时候，也曾感到一些困难，最主要的就是不容易深入下去，有时一段文字要读好几遍才能比较领会其中的意思。不过，我并没有被困难吓倒，我时常这样勉励自己：革命领袖的工作，比我们不知要忙多少倍，他们除了紧张的工作外，还给我们写了许多理论著作，把革命斗争的经验加以总结，难道我们连学习现成的都不能吗？当我读了二、三本之后，便对它们发生了极大的兴趣，书中的丰富内容，像磁力似的吸引着我，使我读了还想再读。我感到革命导师的著作，并不是像有些人所说的那样深奥难懂，只要认真地钻研下去，我们的体会是可以逐步加深的。现在这十二本书我虽然只读了一遍，已感到自己的理论认识和阶级觉悟都有不少的提高。
    在阅读的过程中，我更进一步体会到学习理论的重要性。正像斯大林同志所教导我们的：“马克思主义是关于自然和社会底发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义建设的科学。”（见“马克思主义与语言学问题”）因此，凡是掌握了马克思主义科学的人，便是不可战胜的。我们要想懂得自然和社会的发展规律，要建设社会主义和共产主义社会，要改造自己从旧社会带来的坏习惯和坏思想，就必须加紧学习和掌握马克思列宁主义。在这十二本书里面，不但给了我们马克思列宁主义理论和战略、策略的武器，使我们足以绕过所有一切横在前进途中的暗礁，取得革命斗争的胜利，而且还提供了苏联三十多年来丰富的建设经验，作为我们学习的榜样；不但从原则上指导我们怎样进行祖国的建设；而且还给了我们解决实际问题的具体方法。我以为不管从事那一项革命工作，只要决心学习这十二本书，就可以得到许多宝贵的指示，用以改进和提高自己的工作。
    我们国家正进行着大规模的经济建设，使落后的农业国逐步变为强大的工业国，这是一个极艰巨极复杂的历史任务，没有马克思列宁主义理论的指导，就根本不能完成这一个光荣任务。它的方针、步骤和理论根据等，不仅每个国家的领导干部和经济工作人员应当认识清楚，而且是所有的国家工作人员都应当认识清楚的。“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”一书（“干部必读”之一），就是列宁、斯大林关于建设社会主义的理论和政策，同时也是苏联建设的丰富经验的总结。例如其中关于实行国家工业化的问题，斯大林同志就屡次教导过我们：“工业化的中心，其基础，是在于重工业（燃料、五金等）底发展，归根结底，是生产资料生产之发展，是在于本国的机器制造业之发展。”（“论苏联经济形式与党的政策”）因为“只有重工业，才能把全部工业，运输业以及农业都改造过来，振兴起来。”不这样做，“便不能成为经济上独立的国家。”（“第一个五年计划底总结”）很明显的，经济上不能独立，就不能巩固国防和保卫祖国免受帝国主义的奴役，也就不能不断地提高人民的物质生活和文化生活水平。只有我们认清了这些道理，才能贯彻国家重点建设的方针，克服“百废俱兴”的思想，胜利地进行我们的经济建设。
    又如，我们当前开展的反官僚主义的斗争，在列宁和斯大林的著作中也给了我们许多的宝贵指示。这两位革命导师教导我们“必须明白和官僚主义斗争乃是一种绝对必要的斗争”（列宁：“中央的政治活动”），因为“官僚主义的危险，首先，就是官僚主义埋没了隐藏在我们系统中的无数可能，不利用他们，企图把群众的创造性化为乌有，关在事务房里，使党的每种新的发端都变成细小无聊的贪欲。第二，官僚主义的危险，就是官僚主义经不起关于执行情形的审查，它企图把领导机关的主要指示变成纸上的、和实际生活完全脱离关系的空话。不仅那些钻在我们机关中的旧官僚是有危险的，而新的官僚分子、苏维埃的官僚分子也是危险的，并且比旧官僚更危险。”因此就必须“打倒我们机关中和组织中的官僚主义，消灭官僚主义的‘道德’和‘习惯’，肃清道路，好去利用我们系统中的可能，发展群众的创造性和独立性。”（斯大林：“联共（布）第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论”）
    他们不但告诉我们要坚决和官僚主义作斗争，而且还给我们指出了斗争的方法。斯大林同志说，反官僚主义的斗争，消灭官僚主义的“道德”和“习惯”，不是“一下子”就可以解决的。“在反对官僚主义的斗争中，党的工作向四方面进行：发展自我批评，审查各种工作执行的程度，清洗机关，从工人阶级中自下提拔忠实的工作人员到机关中去。”（同上文）从这些指示里面，可以使我们了解开展反官僚主义斗争的意义和办法，可以使我们深刻地认识到党中央和毛主席指示关于开展反官僚主义斗争的英明。
    学习马克思列宁主义的重要意义，这是同志们都会理解的。不过也可能有的同志认为这十二本书虽然是“干部必读”，但自己却抽不出时间来读它们。在没有阅读之前，很可能对厚厚的一大堆书望而生畏，不知几时才能把它们读完。我开始阅读的时候也曾有过这种思想。但我的经验证明，不论工作怎样繁忙，只要下决心，科学地支配时间，是完全可以坚持学习下去的。两年前，有人计算了一下，“干部必读”的十二本书共有三三八一页，比较细心地读一遍，每天一小时读十页，一年便可读完；每天读半小时读五页，两年可以读完；如果预定三年读完的话，只需每天读二十分钟就够了。当然，要想精通其中的全部理论；那是长期的、毕生的事业。
    时间是很宝贵的，我们应当特别爱惜时间。时间跑的很快，稍微一放松，几十分钟就过去了。如果抓紧时间，不使它白白浪费，日久天长，坚持学习，就会有很大的收获。在这两年当中，我没有因为学习“干部必读”而影响了日常工作，相反地，是推进了日常工作。因为通过学习，我的思想水平提高了，更加热爱自己的工作了。在工作中使我更有勇气来克服困难，学习业务，尽自己的力量把工作做好；当个人利益和集体利益矛盾的时候，我总是尽力克服个人的打算，以求做到服从革命整体的需要。今后我还要继续努力学习，改正我的缺点，提高我的思想，把我的工作做得更好一些。
