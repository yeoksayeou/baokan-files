Relieving the Masses' Ideological Concerns and Resolving Specific Problems
Wujiayuan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative Smoothly Transformed into Mutual Aid Teams

Wujiayuan Village in Tianzhen County, Shanxi Province, only had two mutual aid teams for show, and the masses had no desire to establish a cooperative. However, the county leadership, without understanding the situation, blindly decided to establish a cooperative in this village. Consequently, Wu Qixing, a fake labor model, and Wu Qishun, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to win glory by establishing the cooperative, adopted coercive measures and forced cooperative members to contribute their livestock and farm tools at assessed prices. This resulted in ideological confusion among the masses, with some farmers indulging in excessive eating and drinking, and spring plowing production came to a standstill. Only after the county leaders learned of the above situation did they decide to send cadres to Wujiayuan Village to help the masses transform the cooperative into mutual aid teams.

The first difficulty the county and district cadres encountered upon arriving was the great ideological apprehension of the masses. Some of the masses feared that the county and district cadres had come to investigate the responsibility for the failure of the agricultural production cooperative and to rectify their unwillingness to "communize" their thoughts. Some believed that "communization" was inevitable sooner or later, that even if they didn't establish a cooperative this year, they would have to do so in the future, adopting a neutral attitude of "it's okay to establish it, and it's okay to stop it." Still others, lazy and shiftless, genuinely wanted to "eat from the big pot" and were dissatisfied with stopping the cooperative, scolding those unwilling to join as saboteurs. The village cadres who had organized the cooperative to win glory were afraid of losing face and being disgraced if the cooperative was stopped, and they were also dissatisfied with stopping the cooperative. In response to the above situation, the county and district cadres first expressed their attitude to stabilize everyone's emotions; then they conducted propaganda and education on the policy of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation. In the process, they criticized the cadres' thought of blindly rushing forward for glory, and pointed out the disadvantages of impetuosity and coercion. They repeatedly publicized the policy of voluntary mutual benefit to the peasant masses, explaining that establishing a cooperative was not "communization," but was aimed at developing production and enabling farmers to embark on the road to a prosperous life. They also criticized the lazy and shiftless elements' thinking of "eating from the big pot," explaining that they lived by their labor now, and only labor could bring happiness in the future. In this way, the cessation of the cooperative was supported by the masses.

In the specific work of transforming the cooperative into mutual aid teams, a second difficulty was encountered. This was the difficulty in resolving issues such as the livestock that had been contributed to the cooperative, the fertilizer that had been sent to the fields, and the money earned from sideline businesses during the winter. In particular, the livestock that had been contributed to the cooperative were thinner than before due to poor management, which made it even more difficult to resolve. After the county and district cadres fully mobilized the cooperative members to discuss and brainstorm together, these problems were resolved reasonably one by one. First, the livestock were returned to their original owners, and the original owners were given a reasonable amount of grass and fodder from the cooperative's sideline income to compensate for the weight loss; if the livestock became ill, the cooperative would pay part of the cost for the original owner to treat them. Second, the fertilizer sent to the fields was valued based on the quality of the fertilizer, and the recipient of the fertilizer paid a reasonable price to the donor of the fertilizer. Third, the money earned by the cooperative last winter from transporting goods, after deducting the expenses for food, feeding horses, and supplementing households with thin livestock, was distributed according to the amount of labor contributed by each cooperative member. Fourth, labor issues were resolved through work evaluation, with those who worked longer hours being compensated by those who worked fewer hours, and the cooperative members mutually allocating labor. After these problems were resolved, three permanent mutual aid teams were formed with twenty-two cooperative members based on the principle of voluntarism.

Since Wujiayuan Village corrected the deviation of blindly establishing cooperatives, the masses have understood the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation, and their enthusiasm for production has increased from low to high. Now, the mutual aid teams are working hard on spring plowing. Some are repairing plows, and others are buying new harrows, preparing to plow and harrow the land. Wu Zhiyou did not collect manure for forty days after joining the cooperative, but after switching to a mutual aid team, he collected six loads of manure in three days. He said: "This year, I want to cultivate one mu of high-yield grain and guarantee a yield of five hundred catties."

    解除群众思想顾虑解决具体问题
    吴家园村农业生产合作社顺利转成互助组
    山西省天镇县吴家园村只有两个假报的常年互助组，群众根本没有建社要求。但该县领导机关不了解情况，盲目确定在这个村办社。于是，这个村的假劳动模范吴起兴和中共党员吴起顺为了办社争光荣，就采用强迫命令的办法建社，并强迫社员把牲口和农具作价入社。结果闹得群众思想混乱，有些农民大吃二喝，春耕生产陷于停顿。县领导干部知道上述情况后，才决定派干部到吴家园村，帮助群众把社转为互助组。
    县、区干部下去时，遇到的头一个困难是群众思想顾虑很大。有部分群众怕县、区干部来追查农业生产合作社没搞好的责任，整他们不愿“共产”的思想。有部分群众认为多会儿也要“共产”，今年不办社以后也得办，抱着“办也行，停也好”的中间态度。另有一些懒汉二流子真想“吃大锅饭”，对停止办社不满，骂不愿入社的群众是破坏分子。那些为争光荣而组社的村干部，则怕停了社面子上过不去，太丢人，对停止办社也不满。针对以上情况，县、区干部首先表明态度，安定大家的情绪；随后便进行了农业互助合作政策的宣传教育。在这当中，批判了干部为争光荣而盲目冒进的思想，指出了急性病和强迫命令的坏处。对农民群众则反复宣传了自愿互利政策，说明建社不是“共产”，是为了发展生产，使农民走上丰衣足食的道路。并批判了懒汉二流子的“吃大锅饭”思想，说明现在是凭劳动过活，将来也只有劳动才能享幸福。这样，停办社就得到了群众的拥护。
    在把社转为互助组的具体工作中，又碰到了第二个困难。这就是归了社的牲畜，送到地里的肥料，冬季搞副业赚得的钱等问题，都很难解决。特别是入社的牲口，由于管理不好，比以前瘦了，这一点更难解决。这些问题经过县、区干部充分发动社员讨论，共同想办法以后，才一一得到合理解决。第一，牲口归还原主，变瘦了的酌情从社内赚下的副业款内，给原主补助一些草料；如牲口发生了疾病，由社出一部钱让原主治疗。第二，送到地里的肥料，根据肥料质量好坏，由得粪户付给出粪户合理代价。第三，社内去年冬天拉脚赚下的钱，除人吃喂马和补给瘦牲口户的费用外，按每个社员劳动多少分红。第四，用工问题，经过评工，长退短补，由社员互相调拨。在这些问题解决以后，即根据自愿原则，帮助二十二户社员组成三个常年互助组。
    自从吴家园村纠正盲目办社偏向以后，群众知道了党的互助合作政策，生产情绪由低变高。现在，互助组正紧张进行春耕生产。有的修理犁杖，有的买新耱，准备耕地耱地。吴志有入社后，四十天没拾粪，转为互助组以后，三天拾了六担粪。他说：“我今年要弄一亩丰产谷，保证打五百斤。”
