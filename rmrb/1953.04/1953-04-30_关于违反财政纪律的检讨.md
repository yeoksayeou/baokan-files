    Self-Criticism Regarding Violation of Financial Discipline
    Feng Yi, Secretary Chief of the Education Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government

    Editor's Note: On March 5th, this newspaper criticized the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Education Department for violating national financial discipline by instructing subordinate units to arbitrarily spend the remaining funds from last year. Feng Yi, the Secretary Chief of the department, has written twice to express acceptance of the newspaper's criticism. Excerpts from the letters are published below:

    In August 1952, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government added 62.2 billion yuan to our province's education budget. In September and October, we were revising the expense standards and preparing the budget, so these funds were not used for some time. In early November of last year, we allocated these funds down the line. In mid-November, our department held a conference of secondary school principals from across the province. At the close of the conference, I suggested that schools purchase various supplies as soon as possible and withdraw the funds by December 20th, otherwise the bank would freeze them at the end of the year. At the same time, I also allowed schools to purchase bamboo curtains and gauze, which were not urgent. After the meeting, Liu Zhongmin, the section chief of the Secondary Education Section of the Taiyuan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, asked whether various equipment expenses could be used interchangeably, and I agreed. This created and promoted the phenomenon of secondary schools across the province violating financial discipline in order to rush to spend money at the end of the year.

    These facts fully demonstrate that I have a serious sense of departmentalism and lack an overall perspective. Since the Central Ministry of Education added a large amount of funding, and it could not be used reasonably in such a short time, the remaining funds should have been returned to the state. However, I distributed all the funds down the line in order to solve more problems for our department. Twenty secondary schools in Taiyuan, Linfen, and other places purchased sofas, waist drums, cameras, and other items that were not urgently needed, spending over 120 million yuan. When purchasing, schools made cross-year contracts, and violations of cash management regulations were quite common and serious. Some schools even issued false invoices to reimburse themselves from higher authorities. In some areas, the rush to purchase goods affected local market prices. This greatly damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government.

    After the provincial finance department's inspection team clarified these facts of violations of financial discipline, they questioned me as to why I had instructed people to "withdraw funds from the bank before December 20th," "allowed the purchase of bamboo curtains and gauze," and "allowed various education equipment expenses to be used interchangeably." At that time, I resolutely denied it. It was not until recently, when a meeting of the heads of the cultural and education sections of the special commissioner's offices further clarified the situation, that I admitted my mistake. This shows that I was afraid to face my mistakes and dared not boldly and bravely expose them. This is a concrete manifestation of individualism.

    My mistake occurred after the "Three-Anti" movement. During the "Three-Anti" movement, I conducted a self-examination of my mistakes in violating financial regulations, and the organization also educated me. However, because I often fell into the mire of pragmatism in my work and neglected systematic theoretical study, I was unable to improve politically, and therefore my vision was short-sighted and my political principles were weak. Soon, I committed similar errors again.

    The lessons this event has taught me are profound. In addition to continuing to conduct further self-examination and improve my work, I will actively assist the leadership in rectifying and improving the financial work of the education department in order to improve the financial system. Finally, I sincerely propose to the Party and the higher-level government: in order to educate myself and all comrades, I request that I be given disciplinary action.

    关于违反财政纪律的检讨
    山西省人民政府教育厅秘书主任  冯毅
    编者按：本报在三月五日批评了山西省人民政府教育厅违反国家财政纪律，指示所属单位任意花完去年结余款项的错误。该厅秘书主任冯毅两次来信表示接受本报批评，现将来信摘要发表如下：
    一九五二年八月间，中央人民政府教育部给我省追加教育事业费六百二十二亿元；九、十月间，我们正修订经费开支标准和编造预算，这笔款项迟迟没有动用。去年十一月初，我们将这批款先后分拨下去。十一月中旬，我厅召开全省中等学校校长会议，在会议结束时，我提出要各校及早购置各种用品，要在十二月二十日前把款提出，否则年终银行就要冻结；同时还允许各校购买竹帘、纱布这两种冷货。会后，太原市文教局中教科科长刘仲民提出各种设备费能否互相流用，我也答应可以。这就造成并促使了全省中等学校为抢着在年终花钱而违反财政纪律的现象。
    以上这些事实，充分说明了我有严重的本位主义思想，缺乏整体观念。中央教育部追加了大量的经费，既然时间短促，不能合理运用，就应该把剩余的经费交回国家，但我却把全部款往下分配，以便多解决本部门的问题。太原、临汾等地二十个中学校在市场上购买了并不迫切需要的沙发、腰鼓、照像机等，用去一亿二千余万元。在采购时，各校订定跨年度合同，违犯现金管理制度的现象，相当普遍而严重。有些学校竟开假单据向上级报销；有些地区因抢购东西而影响了当地市场价格；这就使党和人民政府的威信受到极大损害。
    省财政厅检查组把这些违反财政纪律的事实检查清楚后，质问我为什么布置“在十二月二十日前提款出银行”，“允许买竹帘、纱布”、“允许各种教育设备费可以互相流用”；我当时坚决不承认；直到最近开专署文教科长会议时，进一步把情况对证清楚后，我才承认了自己的错误。这说明我不敢正视自己的错误，不敢大胆、勇敢地揭发自己的错误，这是一种个人主义的具体表现。
    我的错误是在“三反”运动后发生的。在“三反”运动中，我对自己的违反财政制度的错误，进行过自我检查，组织上也对我进行了教育。但由于自己在工作上常常陷于事务主义的泥坑，忽视了系统的理论学习，自己不能在政治上有所提高，因而眼光短小，政治原则性不强，不久又犯了类似的错误。
    这次事件给予我的教训是深刻的。除自己继续进
    一步进行检查，改进自己的工作外，并积极协助领导整顿和改进教育部门的财务工作，以健全财务制度。最后我诚恳的向党和上级政府提出：为了教育我本人和全体同志，请求给我以纪律处分。
