From the Situation in Xiangyang Special District, Hubei, Some Obstacles to Developing Production in Newly Liberated Rural Areas

Zhang Chao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee

I have inspected three townships in Xiangyang Special District, listened to several reports, and attended joint meetings of county party committee secretaries. From what I have seen, I believe there are several major problems in the countryside today.

The Right of Private Property is Frequently Violated

There are Many Misunderstandings Regarding the Future of Socialism

Land reform has indeed liberated rural productive forces and stimulated farmers' enthusiasm for production; however, further development of this enthusiasm is still limited. Because land reform work has only recently ended, farmers' production morale is not yet stable. Middle peasants are afraid of appearing wealthy, some poor and landless peasants have an "it's good to be poor" mentality, landlords are afraid of further confiscation, and rich peasants are afraid of having their class status raised. Therefore, the idea of "producing without becoming wealthy" is quite prevalent in rural areas. Zhai Jinzhang, a poor peasant from Tanzhuang, Xiangyang County, said: "Now it's no use buying land, just eat and drink!" Chen Yuhai, a middle peasant, had five houses damaged but didn't repair them, saying he had no money; but this year he slaughtered a 150-jin pig without selling any of it, and brewed 1.2 shi (石) of sorghum wine, eating and drinking extravagantly.

基层 cadres and the masses quite universally misunderstand the future of socialism. Chao Wende's father, a district cadre from the Sixth District of Baokang County, sold two of his three oxen to buy sheep to slowly slaughter and eat. The deputy secretary of the Zhangwan District Party Committee in Xiangyang County wrote home telling his family to sell their loom; when they didn't, he criticized his father. Of the 170 district cadres in the Xiangyang County Party School, 74 wrote or told their families, "Socialism is coming soon, don't buy anything, just eat and drink!" Su Peikun, a poor peasant from Tanzhuang, ate all 380 jin of rice and 100 jin of corn he borrowed this year; recently, he sold the blue tiles from his house and replaced them with earthen tiles, using the money to eat and drink. He said, "Socialism will be here sooner or later, and then we'll have everything!" Liu Yangshi used to spin 30 to 40 jin of thread each year, but this year she only spun 5 jin. When asked why she spun less, she said, "I've progressed now and see further."

Private property rights are being violated in various forms. First is "skimming the cream." I have heard of eight forms: (1) When poor and landless peasants hold meetings, middle peasants provide lamp oil; (2) During drought relief pumping, middle peasants provide meals; (3) When repairing dikes, middle peasants and rich peasants provide water; (4) Township cadres ask for operas to be performed, with rich peasants paying for meals and cigarettes; (5) The district stipulates that the daily rent for a yoke of oxen during busy season cannot exceed 5,000 yuan; (6) In mutual aid teams, ox labor is not counted, or is undercounted; some "plant any idle land and use any idle oxen." A middle peasant's ox in Baokang was taken away for rotation for a month and a half without returning home; (7) Assign mutual aid teams to contract the land of orphans and widows; (8) Borrowing without repaying, "borrowing openly and averaging property secretly." All these naturally make people aware: "In these times, there's no benefit to being rich, just having enough to eat and drink is enough, since everything is heading towards averaging anyway!"

Villages adding burdens, cadres embezzling, and township cadres arbitrarily imposing fines are quite serious. Unreasonable loans also cause farmers to suffer. In Zhuxiao District, Xiangyang County, 200,000 jin of rice were almost rotting last year, and the cadres said not to lend it out with interest. But later, when collecting grain, they charged 10% interest and raised the price from 600 yuan per jin to 800 yuan, causing serious dissatisfaction among the masses. Last year, when the wheat was about to ripen, the bank offered loans for digging wells; the masses in a certain township didn't want it, but the bank cadres insisted that everyone take out loans; the masses were busy harvesting wheat and couldn't repair the wells, so the township cadres were forced to deposit the loan back into the bank at the original amount, and the bank demanded that the township cadres pay interest (the deposit interest rate was lower than the loan interest rate).

Demands for Building Water Conservancy Projects are Too Urgent and Too High, and the Use of

Civilian Labor is Unreasonable

There are many serious waste phenomena in the use of farmers' labor.

Mobilizing civilian labor for road construction and water conservancy projects is unreasonable: For a section of road work in Panggong Township, Xiangyang County, which could have been completed by 20-odd people in a day, 300-odd people were mobilized. The masses calculated: "Each person can chop a load of firewood each day and sell it for over 10,000 yuan; how much money could 300-odd people earn!" The Zhuxiao District in Xiangyang County mobilized 800-odd people from the Chunfang, Yuanying, and Dongying townships to repair the Heilong Ditch, but the district government didn't send anyone to lead them; after the masses finished digging on their own, the district cadres went to inspect and said it didn't meet the standards, and ordered a "redo." Digging the Grape Ditch used 400-odd people from Songgui Township, but because the work was started at an inappropriate time (during the autumn harvest and planting) and there was no good organization or leadership, five days of work were done in one day, wasting more than 1,000 workdays. In Panggong Township, Xiangyang County, agricultural income can only sustain half of the year's living expenses, and the other half relies on various sideline incomes; but before the Spring Festival, when sideline businesses were booming, the district government issued a notice requiring 60% of the township's labor force to go to Shuiya to repair reservoirs, and the rest to go to Taipingdian and Nijugou districts to repair water conservancy. Xiangyang County also arranged that in 1953, each district should calculate labor force based on one-fourth of the total population, and each labor force should bear 50 cubic meters of water conservancy tasks. Yicheng County mobilized civilian labor from several districts to repair the Changqu Canal, and many villages spent a lot of money on this, requesting the government to approve the apportionment. This situation is worth noting.

Some village cadres assign work for their own benefit: The township head of Panggong Township didn't hoe his own land when he was idle at home, but took the opportunity to go to the district for a meeting and ordered militiamen to hoe his land for him; when the whole township, old and young, men and women, were fully engaged in catching locusts, the chairman of the farmers' association was a little sick, and his whole family didn't go to catch locusts, and he even called several youth league members to hoe his land for him. The masses are very dissatisfied with these unreasonable uses of other people's labor.

Too Many and Too Long Meetings, Random Demands for Statistical Figures

Too many and too long meetings also waste a lot of manpower; this is especially serious in "key work areas." The masses in Tanzhuang, Xiangyang County, reflected: "Our township has two major diseases this year, one is drought, and the other is 'key work'." The masses in Panggong Township criticized township cadres: "We have meetings every night, and everyone is exhausted. The cooperative committee member goes up and talks about cooperation, the cultural and education committee member talks about cultural and education, the propaganda committee member adds to it, and finally the chairman summarizes, and it takes half the night!" "The district also has meetings all the time, for several days at a time. We really can't afford such meetings!" The chairman of the farmers' association in Kangwan Township, Niumiao District, Baokang County, only did seven days of work in four months.

The higher-ups' random demands for statistical figures also waste a lot of manpower. Last year, when catching locusts in Zhuxiao District, Xiangyang County, in order to count the achievements, they ordered each township to collect the caught locusts and send them to the district for weighing, and some even had to count them one by one. The county leadership called for rushing to plant wheat, and in order to count the achievements, they asked each district to report the number of mu rushed to plant every day; therefore, the districts urged the township cadres to report every day, which increased some unnecessary burdens.

The root of these problems, I believe, is that the vast majority of cadres still use the perspective of social reform to lead production, and do not have a correct understanding of socialism; at the same time, there is subjectivism and commandism that do not proceed from reality at play.

How to Solve These Problems

How to solve these problems? According to Xiangyang's experience: First, county and district cadres must specifically know the production and ideological situation of each class and township cadre, find out the difficulties, clarify the concerns, criticize the misunderstandings of social reform and socialism, as well as subjectivism and commandism, and establish the idea that all work should start from stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for production. Second, start by summarizing the experiences and lessons of organizing mutual aid teams locally, so that cadres understand that leading mutual aid must resolutely abide by the principles of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and master the knowledge of the laws of developing mutual aid. Then, compare the differences between the situations before and after land reform, so that cadres understand how to lead work after the transition from land reform to production construction.

The vast majority of cadres must fully understand that the key to the good or bad relationship between cadres and the masses in rural areas now lies in whether the cadres can lead production well and make farmers change from poor to rich. In democratic state-building work, we must closely focus on the central task of doing a good job in production, use democratic methods to correct and implement production policies, help the masses overcome difficulties, break down concerns, clarify the direction, and fully stimulate their enthusiasm for production.

In some townships in Xiangyang County, during democratic state-building, the ten major policies of the Central South Region on agricultural production were publicized in a big way, and district and township cadres conducted criticism and self-criticism in connection with reality; at the mass meeting, the township cadres summarized and reviewed the past work, made reasonable handling of the infringement of private property rights, and announced the abolition of the "rules" that hindered production. This is the most practical approach. Wherever this has been done, the production morale of the people of all classes has generally risen.

In addition, although the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee's several disciplinary regulations are not complete, they also have a certain role in solving the above problems, such as: (1) It is forbidden to convene township cadres and mass meetings casually, township cadres' meetings in the whole district are subject to county approval, and mass meetings in the whole township are subject to district approval; (2) Meetings should be planned and prepared, and should be kept as short as possible; (3) The masses should not be allowed to deliver letters casually, and the district's messengers should be responsible for delivering letters; (4) Civilian laborers should be paid wages; (5) Substitute plowing should be approved by the representative assembly, and cadres are not allowed to casually assign work to themselves; (6) The forms required by various departments should be unified, combined where they should be, simplified where they should be, and removed where they should be, to reduce the energy burden of cadres and the masses; (7) It is forbidden to beat, scold, fine, or detain the masses at will; (8) The branch must frequently study the reflections of the masses and continuously improve the leadership of the township according to the opinions of the masses.

    从湖北襄阳专区的情况看当前新区农村发展生产的一些障碍
    中共湖北省委副秘书长  张超
    我到襄阳专区先后考察了三个乡，听取了几次汇报，又参加了各县委书记联席会。从接触到的情况看，我认为当前农村中有几个主要问题。
    私有财产权时常被侵犯
    对社会主义前途有很多误解
    土地改革确实解放了农村生产力，发挥了农民生产积极性；但这种积极性的进一步发挥，还受着限制。因为土地改革工作结束不久，农民生产情绪还不安定，中农怕露富，某些贫雇农有“以贫为荣”的思想，地主怕再没收，富农怕提升成分，因此，农村中相当普遍地存在着“生产不发家”的思想。襄阳县谭庄贫农翟金章说：“现在也不兴买地，吃点喝点算啦！”中农陈玉海坏了五间房子，不修补，说没钱；但他今年杀了一个一百五十斤的大猪，一斤没卖，并烧了一石二斗高粱的酒，大吃大喝。
    基层干部和群众相当普遍地对社会主义前途有误解。保康县六区区干部晁文道的父亲，把家里的三条牛卖了两条，买成羊慢慢杀着吃。襄阳县张壪区区委副书记给家里写信叫卖织布机；家里没卖，他还将他父亲批评了一顿。襄阳县党校中一百七十个区干部，有七十四个给家里写信或口头告诉家里说：“快社会主义了，不要置买东西，吃点喝点算啦！”谭庄贫农苏培坤把今年贷到的三百八十斤大米、一百斤苞谷都吃光了；近来又把房子上的青瓦卖了，换上土瓦，抽出钱来吃喝。他说：“早晚到社会主义，那时啥没有呢！”刘杨氏过去每年纺三、四十斤线子，今年只纺了五斤。问她为什么纺少了，她说：“我现在进步了，看得远了。”
    私人财产权受着多种形式的侵犯。首先是“揩油”。仅我听得的就有八种形式：（一）贫雇农开会，中农出灯油；（二）抗旱抽水，中农管饭；（三）修堤，中农、富农管水喝；（四）乡干部请唱戏，富农出钱管饭管烟。（五）区上规定，忙时租牛一犋每天不能超过五千元；（六）互助组中牛工不计分，或少计分；还有的则是“见闲地就种，见闲牛就用”。保康一个中农的牛，拉走轮用一个半月未回家；（七）派互助组包耕孤寡户的土地；
    （八）有借无还，“明借暗均产”。这些都自然而然地使人们意识着：“这年头，富了没好处、有吃有喝就行啦，反正是朝着平均办咧！”
    村里加派负担，干部贪污，乡干部随便罚款的现象相当严重。贷款不合理，也使农民吃亏。襄阳县竹筱区去年二十万斤大米快烂了，干部说不要利贷出去。但以后收粮时要一分利，并在价钱上由一斤六百元涨到八百元，惹起群众严重不满。去年麦子将熟的时候，银行贷款打井；某乡群众不要，银行干部硬要大家贷；群众忙着收麦，不能修井，乡干部被迫把贷款原数存到银行，银行反要乡干部补利息（存款利息比贷款利息低）。
    兴修水利要求过急过高，使用
        民工不合理
    在使用农民的劳动力上存在着很多严重浪费现象。
    修公路、修水利动员民工不合理：襄阳县庞公乡的一段路工，本来动员二十几个人一天就可以作完，却调了三百来人。群众是这样算账的：“每人每天砍一担柴，卖一万多元；三百来人，看能进多少钱啦！”襄阳县竹筱区调用春芳、袁营、董营三个乡八百来人修黑龙沟，区政府不去人领导；群众自己在那里挖完了，区干部去检查，说不合标准，又下令“返工”。挖葡萄沟用松桂乡四百来人，因动工不适时（正值秋收秋种），又没有很好地组织领导，结果一天的工做了五天，浪费了一千多个工。襄阳县庞公乡农业收入只能维持全年生活的一半，另一半要靠各种副业收入；但在春节以前，副业旺盛的时候，区政府下通知要全乡劳动力的百分之六十到水涯修水库，其余分赴太平店、泥咀沟区去修水利。襄阳县又布置一九五三年每区按总人口的四分之一计算劳动力，每个劳动力要负担五十方土的水利任务。宜城县修长渠动员了几个区的民工，许多村子为此用款很多，要求政府批准摊派。这情况是值得注意的。
    有些乡村干部为私派工：庞公乡的乡长在家闲着的时候不锄地，却趁着去区里开会的机会，派民兵给他锄地；全乡男女老少正在全力捕蝗的时候，农会主席有点小病，全家不去捕蝗，还叫几个青年团员给自己锄地。对于这些无理动用别人劳动力的现象，群众非常不满。
    会议太多太长，乱要统计数字
    会议太多、太长，也浪费了许多人力；特别是工作“重点地区”更为严重。襄阳县谭庄群众反映：“我们乡今年有两大病，一是天旱，一是‘重点’。”庞公乡群众批评乡干部：“每天晚上开会，大家累得不得了。合作委员上去讲了一套合作，文教委员讲了一套文教，宣传委员又作补充，最后主席总结，一弄大半夜！”“区上也是老开会，一开就是几天。这样的会我们真开不起！”保康县燕壪乡四个部门同时开四个会，各部门各自布置自己的部门工作；每个部门开了乡干部会后，又都召开了个群众大会。牛庙区康壪乡农会主席四个月只做了七天活。
    上面乱要统计数字也浪费了许多人力。襄阳县竹筱区去年捕蝗，为了统计成绩，命令每乡把捕的蝗收集送区过秤，有的还要让一个个地计数。县领导机关号召抢种麦子，为了统计成绩，让每区每天把抢种亩数上报；因此，区里就催乡干部每天报告，这样就加重了一些不必要的负担。
    这些问题的根源，我认为主要是广大干部仍然用社会改革的观点来领导生产，对于社会主义也没有正确的认识；同时，有不从实际出发的主观主义和强迫命令作风在作怪。
    怎样解决这些问题
    怎样解决这些问题呢？根据襄阳的经验：首先要使县区干部具体地知道各阶层和乡干部的生产情况和思想情况，查明困难，摸清顾虑，批判对社会改革、社会主义的误解和主观主义、强迫命令作风，确立一切工作从发挥农民生产积极性着眼的思想。其次要从总结当地组织互助组的经验教训入手，使干部懂得领导互助必须坚决遵守自愿两利的原则，掌握发展互助的规律性的知识。然后对比土地改革前后的情况的不同，使干部认识从土地改革转入生产建设以后应该怎样做领导工作。
    必须使广大干部完全了解，现在农村中干部和群众的关系好坏的关键，在于干部是否能把生产领导好，使农民由贫困变成富裕。在民主建政工作中，必须紧紧地围绕着搞好生产的中心任务，用民主的方法，端正和贯彻生产政策，帮助群众克服困难，打破顾虑，明确方向，充分发挥生产积极性。
    襄阳县有些乡在民主建政中，大张旗鼓地宣传了中南区关于农业生产的十大政策，区乡干部联系实际进行了批评和自我批评；在群众大会上，乡干部对过去的工作作了总结和检讨，对侵犯私有权的事情作了合理的处理，把妨碍生产的“规矩”宣布废除。这是一个最实际的办法。凡是这样做了的地方，各阶层人民的生产情绪就普遍高涨起来。
    此外，襄阳地委的几项纪律性的规定，虽然不完整，但对解决上述问题也有其一定的作用，如：（一）不准随便召开乡干部、群众大会，全区乡干部会经县批准，全乡群众大会经区批准；（二）开会要有计划，有准备，尽量开短；（三）不能随便让群众送信，区里通讯员应担负送信任务；（四）用民工要出工资；（五）代耕要经代表会批准，干部不准随便派工给自己做活；（六）各部门所需表格要统一，该并的并，该简的简，该去掉的去掉，以减少干部与群众的精力负担；（七）禁止对群众随便打骂、罚款、管扣；（八）支部必须经常研究群众反映，不断根据群众意见改进乡的领导。
