(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 28) The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communique on April 28:

The two negotiating delegations continued their meeting on April 28. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, gave a detailed explanation of our proposal at the meeting, and pointed out that our proposal was put forward as a basis for consultation and discussion between the two sides after considering the opinions in the other side's letter of April 16. However, since the resumption of the meeting, the other side has refused to engage in concrete discussions at the meeting and has adopted an attitude of obliterating and negating everything, which is obviously not conducive to the progress of the meeting. General Nam Il asked the other side to put forward positive opinions sufficient to promote the progress of the meeting. General Nam Il's speech said:

"It is a matter of course that both sides should repatriate all prisoners of war they have received to the side to which they belong after the armistice. The so-called 'forced repatriation' is completely untenable. Only in order to eliminate the differences between the two sides on this issue and quickly achieve an armistice in Korea, our side has made concessions in the steps, time, and procedures of repatriation, and suggested that the repatriation of prisoners of war be carried out in two steps. All prisoners of war who insist on repatriation should be directly repatriated immediately after the armistice, and the remaining prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated should be sent to a neutral country so that a fair solution can be obtained for their repatriation issue. The specific implementation plan proposed by our side based on this principle and considering the three suggestions in your letter of April 16 is the most reasonable and practical plan.

Our side advocates that the two sides negotiate and determine a neutral country to which to send those prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated. The neutral country we are now discussing is a neutral country that is prepared to receive the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated into its own territory and provide temporary custody, not a neutral country that sends representatives to Korea to supervise the Korean armistice and participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. A neutral country unilaterally nominated as a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission cannot be the only neutral country to take custody of prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated. Our side firmly believes that it is absolutely necessary and our firm position that the neutral country taking custody of prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated must be agreed upon by both parties. On the premise of sending prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country, our side does not intend to nominate such a neutral country from among the member countries of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

We advocate that within one month after the completion of the direct repatriation of prisoners of war two months after the armistice, the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated who are suspicious and dare not return home should be sent to this neutral country agreed upon by both parties, so that they can be completely free from the influence of the detaining party, so that people from their home country can explain to them and eliminate their fears, so that they can happily return to their motherland. If the detaining party has no intention of using the influence of its long-term detention on the prisoners of war to prevent them from returning to their motherland, there is no reason to oppose sending them to a neutral country.

In order to eliminate the fears accumulated by prisoners of war during long-term detention, there is no reason to impose any restrictions on the time for the prisoners of war's home country to explain. However, considering the opinions put forward in your letter of April 16, our side proposes that within a six-month period after the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated arrive in the neutral country, their home country should explain to them. In view of the fears accumulated by the prisoners of war during the long-term torture by the detaining party, it is absolutely necessary for them to stay in a neutral country for an appropriate period and for representatives of the prisoners of war's home country to explain to them during this period to eliminate their fears so that they can happily return to their motherland.

According to our plan, the war of bloodshed constantly created by the prisoners of war can be quickly stopped, the prisoners of war who insist on repatriation can immediately go home, and the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated because of fear can also eliminate their fears and quickly go home. There is no basis for distorting our plan to allow prisoners of war to go home into a plan for indefinite detention. Our plan states very clearly that prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated who request to go home after being explained to by their home country in a neutral country can quickly go home. Our side believes that no one has any reason to be unwilling to see prisoners of war happily return to their motherland and families.

We do not believe that prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated will still have fears and dare not return home after being explained to by their home country in a neutral environment.

However, since your side raised this issue in your letter of April 16, in order to quickly reach an agreement and achieve an armistice, we still propose that, under this hypothetical situation, the handling of such prisoners of war should be negotiated and decided by a higher-level political conference. The higher-level political conference should undoubtedly be able to resolve this hypothetical issue. Once the principle that this issue should be resolved through consultation by a political conference is determined, the technical issues of how to submit it to the political conference are not difficult to arrange.

It can be seen that the reasonableness and constructiveness of our plan cannot be obliterated by any distortion.

In order to eliminate the only differences between the two sides and quickly achieve an armistice in Korea, our side has considered your three opinions and put forward a specific implementation plan for resolving the entire prisoner of war issue as a basis for consultation and discussion between the two sides. Your side's attitude of refusing to engage in concrete discussions for the past two days is obviously not conducive to the progress of the meeting. Our side is still prepared to conduct discussions in the spirit of mutual consultation in order to seek a solution to the problem. We believe that both parties in the negotiations should carefully consider each other's suggestions and should not obliterate everything and completely deny them, because this is detrimental to the hope of promoting an armistice in Korea in the spirit of consultation. Our side is willing to listen to any positive opinions from your side that are sufficient to promote the progress of the meeting."

The two sides are scheduled to continue the plenary session of the two delegations at 11:00 a.m. on April 29.

    南日大将在双方谈判代表团会议上
    说明我方方案的合理性与建设性
    并驳斥对方拒绝进行具体讨论的态度
    【新华社开城二十八日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十八日发表公报如下：
    四月二十八日双方谈判代表团继续举行会议。我方首席代表南日大将在会上就我方方案做了详细的说明，并指出我方方案是在考虑了对方四月十六日来信中的意见后，提出作为双方协商讨论的基础的。而对方自复会以来，在会上拒绝进行具体讨论，并采取了抹煞与否定一切的态度，显然是无助于会议的进展的。南日大将要求对方提出足以促进会议进展的积极性的意见。南日大将的发言说：
    “停战后双方将所收容的全部战俘遣返到他们所属的一方，本来是天经地义的事，所谓‘强迫遣返’之说是根本不能成立的。只是为了消除双方在这个问题上的分歧，迅速获致朝鲜的停战，我方在遣返的步骤、时间和程序上作了让步，建议把战俘的遣返分成两个步骤来进行。一切坚持遣返的战俘在停战后立即直接遣返，其余未被直接遣返的战俘则送交一个中立国，以便对他们的遣返问题取得公正的解决。我方根据这一原则并考虑了你方四月十六日来信中的三点建议而提出的具体实施方案，是最合理和实际的方案。
    我方主张双方协商确定一个中立国家，以便将那些未被直接遣返的战俘送去，我们现在所要讨论的中立国是准备将未被直接遣返的战俘接收到它自己的领土上去，并予以临时看管的一个中立国，而不是派代表前来朝鲜监督朝鲜停战，参加中立国监察委员会的中立国。一方单独提名作为中立国监察委员会一员的中立国，不可能作为收管未被直接遣返的战俘的唯一的一个中立国家。我方坚决认为收管未被直接遣返的战俘的中立国必须由双方协议商定，这是完全必要的，也是我方的坚定的立场。在将未被直接遣返的战俘送交一个中立国的前提下，我方不打算从组成中立国监察委员会的成员国家中提名这样的中立国家。
    我们主张在停战后两个月完成了战俘的直接遣返之后的一个月内，将心怀疑惧不敢回家的未被直接遣返的战俘送到这个双方同意的中立国去，使他们完全脱离拘留一方的影响，以便他们的所属国家派人对他们进行解释消除他们的疑惧，使他们得以欣然返回祖国。如果拘留一方无意利用其长期拘留对战俘们的影响来阻止他们返回祖国，就没有任何理由来反对将他们送到中立国去。
    为了消除战俘在长期拘留中所积累起来的疑惧，本来就没有理由对战俘所属一方进行解释的时间加以任何的限制。但考虑了你方四月十六日来信中所提出的意见，我方主张在未被直接遣返的战俘到达中立国后的六个月期限内，由他们的所属一方向他们进行解释。鉴于战俘们在拘留一方长期折磨中所积累起来的疑惧，他们在中立国一个适当时期的停留和战俘所属国的代表在这个时期内向他们进行解释，以消除他们的疑惧，使他们得以欣然返回祖国，是完全必要的。
    根据我方方案，不断制造战俘的流血的战争迅速可以停止，坚持遣返的战俘立即可以回家，因心怀疑惧而未被直接遣返的战俘也得以消除疑惧而迅速回家。没有任何根据将我方这个使战俘回家的方案歪曲成为无限期拘留的方案。我们的方案说得很清楚，未被直接遣返的战俘在中立国经过所属一方的解释后要求回家者即可迅速回家。我方认为任何人都没有理由不愿看到战俘欣然回到他们的祖国和家庭。
    我们不相信未被直接遣返的战俘在中立国的环境下经过他们所属一方的解释还有疑惧未消，不敢回家者。
    但由于你方在四月十六日来信中提出这一问题，我们为了迅速达成协议，实现停战，仍然提出建议，即在这种假设的情况下对这种战俘的处理应该由高一级的政治会议协商决定，高一级的政治会议无疑地是应该并且能够解决这个假设的问题的。而只要这个问题由政治会议协商解决的原则一经确定，如何提交政治会议的技术问题是不难安排的。
    由此可见，我方方案的合理性与建设性不是任何歪曲所可抹煞的。
    为了消除双方之间仅有的分歧，迅速实现朝鲜停战，我方已经考虑了你方三点意见，提出了解决整个战俘问题的具体实施方案作为双方协商讨论的基础。你方两天来拒绝进行具体讨论的态度，显然是无助于会议的进展的。我方仍然准备本着互相协商的精神进行讨论，以求得问题的解决。我们认为双方在谈判中对于对方的建议应该仔细考虑而不应该抹煞一切，完全否定，因为这是对于以协商精神促成朝鲜停战的希望不利的。我方愿意听取你方任何足以促进会议进展的积极性的意见。”
    双方定于四月二十九日上午十一时继续举行双方代表团大会。
