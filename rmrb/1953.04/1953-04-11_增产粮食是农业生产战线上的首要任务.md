Increasing Grain Production is the Primary Task on the Agricultural Production Front

For three years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Chinese farmers have made tremendous efforts to increase grain production. China's grain production has not only recovered to the level before the Anti-Japanese War, but in some areas has even surpassed it. China has changed from a grain importing country to a grain exporting country. The lives of people in urban and rural areas have improved considerably due to increased grain production. However, it would be completely wrong to think that China's grain problem has been completely and finally solved. First, the so-called level before the Anti-Japanese War was originally a very pitiful level, the level of agricultural production in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. We certainly have no reason to be satisfied with a slight excess of this level. Second, in the past, the vast majority of Chinese farmers lived in poverty with "bran and vegetables for half the year," but now the vast majority of Chinese farmers have improved living conditions, and the demand for grain has increased; with the development of agricultural production, the demand for livestock feed and commercial fertilizers has also increased; with the rapid increase in the urban population and industrial population, more grain is needed. However, the area of cultivated land in China cannot be rapidly expanded in a few years to meet this demand. Third, in connection with this, after the land reform, due to the decentralization of management, the self-sufficient small-peasant economy has relatively increased, while the national commodity grain may be relatively reduced, thus affecting the grain supply to cities. Fourth, our agricultural production is still greatly restricted by natural conditions. Although after three years of bumper harvests, farmers have begun to have some strength to resist natural disasters, the reserves sufficient to overcome any disaster have not yet been accumulated, and such reserves are extremely necessary during the period of economic construction, otherwise it will affect the balance between the various sectors of the national economy and put our economic construction in new difficulties. All this fully shows that the grain problem is still an urgent problem that has not been finally solved, but must be solved. If we ignore this issue, it will create a political error.

In order to solve the grain problem, we must make long-term plans and strive to increase production. We must determine a policy to regard increasing grain production as the primary task on the agricultural production front in the next few years, and we must make everyone understand the great importance of mastering more and better grain. In recent years, many leading organs, rural work cadres and farmers have developed a mindset that increasing the production of cash crops is the top priority, believing that only by developing cash crops can we support industry and increase farmers' income. This is obviously a one-sided idea. Of course, we need to increase the production of more cash crops, not only because industry needs it, but also because agriculture itself needs it. However, this task can only be solved by increasing the yield per unit area, and cannot be solved by expanding the area of cash crop cultivation and reducing the area of grain crop cultivation without limit. It should be pointed out that the main task on China's agricultural production front, in the past, now and for many years to come, should be to increase grain production. In a country with such a large population as China, and before the realization of agricultural mechanization, it will take many years of effort to eliminate the gap between actual grain production and demand. During this period, the grain problem is likely to continue to manifest itself as a tense issue. Comrade Stalin said in the "Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" at the beginning of the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union: "In the rural economy, the following problems are facing us: (1) The problem of consolidating the status of raw material plants, the method is to ensure that there is a sufficient amount of cheap grain products in those areas. (2) To improve animal husbandry and solve the meat problem, the method is to ensure that there are sufficient grain products and forage in those areas. (3) Completely solve the grain problem, which is now the main problem in the rural economy. In this way, the grain problem is the basic problem in the rural economy, the key to solving all other problems." If we relax grain production and use the main force to produce cash crops at the very beginning of the country's planned economic construction, it is obviously incorrect.

Of course, since China's current rural economy is still dominated by the small-peasant economy, we must absolutely not adopt the method of direct planning and command execution to force farmers to increase grain production, but can only adopt economic methods through market activities and political methods acceptable to farmers to achieve it. In recent years, the People's Government has adopted a policy of rewarding cash crops, which has enabled farmers to obtain great benefits from planting cash crops, which has aroused farmers' interest in continuing to plant large amounts of cash crops. Now, under the new conditions that the People's Government has guaranteed the current needs of the cotton textile industry and civilian wadding in the national cotton production, in order to encourage the planting of grain crops, it has stipulated a reasonable ratio of cotton and grain and normal seasonal price differences in 1953, and appropriately increased the price of grain, which may guide farmers to grow more grain crops. Cadres at all levels should take the new cotton-grain ratio stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council as the standard, conduct correct publicity to farmers, explaining that increasing grain production is beneficial to the country's economic construction and to farmers, and mobilize farmers to stabilize the cotton field planting area at the 1952 level, neither increasing nor decreasing excessively. Instead, focus on increasing yield per unit area. This publicity work must be completed before the spring plowing and sowing. At the same time, we should concentrate all our efforts to strengthen the leadership of grain production, strictly prevent the reduction of the planting area of grain crops, ensure the 100% completion of the grain sowing plan, and adopt various methods to help farmers increase the yield per unit area of grain in terms of agricultural loans, technical guidance, etc. By adopting correct price policies, appropriate economic assistance and persuasion and education methods, we can lead farmers to complete the major task of increasing grain production. According to the current situation, China's grain is sufficient. Continuing to increase grain production can further solve the problem of reserves, so as to smoothly guarantee the country's industrialization construction plan without unexpected difficulties.

In order to cooperate with the task of increasing grain production, we must also rationally use the existing commodity grain. Grain work departments should concentrate all their efforts to do a good job in the transportation and supply of commodity grain. At present, the commodity grain controlled by our country is sufficient to supply the needs of the market, but the storage areas are scattered, and the grain types and distribution areas are unbalanced. If the transportation and adjustment work is not done well, things will become tense. Therefore, the grain department must concentrate the necessary commodity grain in a convenient position for maneuver, first ensuring the needs of large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, and planning to adjust the grain needed in cash crop areas and grain-deficient areas. We have enough strength to solve the seasonal grain shortage phenomenon in these areas. The idea of selling at a high price is wrong. The problem lies in whether grain workers can understand and grasp the market needs for grain in various places, can formulate and implement reasonable transportation plans, and can appropriately grasp regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences, and sell grain in a timely manner. As long as we do these tasks well, and at the same time strengthen market management and prevent illegal merchants from speculating and making trouble during the peak season of grain sales, we can completely stabilize the grain market.

In coordination with the task of increasing grain production and increasing reserves, advocating saving grain among the vast consumers, especially urban residents, is also a feasible and beneficial measure. In the past year or two, residents of many cities have developed a trend of excessive demand for eating fine rice and fine flour, and the amount of grain consumption has gradually increased. It is perfectly right for citizens to ask for better food. But it is even more perfectly right for the state to reserve an appropriate amount of grain. Grain consumers must not only consider daily consumption, but should also consider the needs of the whole year; moreover, rice and flour are too finely manufactured, which will inevitably reduce the nutrition of grain. According to statistics, if every 100 catties of rice and wheat produced last year can increase by two catties of rice and flour, it is enough for 6 million people to eat for a year, which is a very huge number. Therefore, according to the actual situation of existing machine-made rice and flour, the processing accuracy should be appropriately reduced to save raw grain, increase finished products, and expand social reserves. Of course, since the quality of grain varies from place to place, it is currently difficult to stipulate a unified national processing standard; however, it is necessary and possible to stipulate regional processing standards based on the principles of saving consumption, increasing nutrition, and taking care of residents' living habits.

In the past three years, we have strived for continuous bumper harvests, which have brought about extremely favorable changes in the country's grain situation. This year, we must make greater efforts to strive for another bumper harvest year and complete and overfulfill the state's plan to increase grain production. As long as we continue to win victories on the agricultural front, we can provide a reliable material guarantee for the country's large-scale economic construction.

    增产粮食是农业生产战线上的首要任务
    三年以来，我国农民在共产党和人民政府领导下，为着增产粮食，进行了巨大的努力。我国的粮食生产不仅已经恢复到抗日战争以前的水平，有些地方并且已经超过了这个水平。我国已由粮食的输入国变为粮食的输出国。城乡人民的生活由于粮食的增产获得了相当的改善。但是，如果以为我国的粮食问题已经获得完全的最后的解决，那就完全错了。第一、所谓抗日战争以前的水平，原是一种十分可怜的水平，是半殖民地半封建社会的农业生产水平，我们当然没有任何理由满足于稍稍超过这个水平的成绩。第二、过去中国农民绝大多数是处在“糠菜半年粮”的贫困生活中，而现在我国广大农民由于获得了改善生活的条件，对于粮食的需要量增多了；随着农业生产的发展，牲畜饲料和商品肥料的需要量也增多了；随着城市人口和工业人口的迅速增加，更需要大批粮食。但我国的耕地面积在几年内还不能迅速扩大，不能适应这种要求。第三、与此相联的，在土地改革以后，由于经营分散，自给自足的小农经济相对增加，而全国的商品粮则可能相对减少，因此影响了对于城市的粮食供应。第四、我们的农业生产还受着自然条件的极大限制，虽然经过三年的丰收，农民开始有了一些抵抗天灾的力量，但是，足以战胜任何灾害的储备，却还没有来得及积蓄起来，而这种储备在经济建设时期却是万分必要的，否则就会影响国民经济各部门之间的平衡，使我们的经济建设陷于新的困难当中。这一切，都充分地说明了粮食问题还是一个紧迫的、尚未最终解决、但必须加以解决的问题。我们如果忽视了这一问题，就会造成一种政治上的错误。
    为了解决粮食问题，必须作长期打算，努力增产。要确定一个方针，把增产粮食当作今后几年以内农业生产战线上第一位的任务，要使大家懂得掌握更多、更好的粮食的极大重要性。几年以来，许多领导机关、农村工作干部和农民，产生了一种增产经济作物第一的思想，以为只有发展经济作物，才算支援工业，才能增加农民收入。这显然是一种带有片面性的想法。当然，我们需要增产更多的经济作物，这不仅因为工业需要它，而且农业本身也需要它。但这个任务只能由提高单位面积产量来解决，而不能漫无限制地用扩大经济作物耕地面积、缩小粮食耕地面积的办法来增产经济作物。应该指出：我国农业生产战线上的主要任务，过去、现在和今后若干年，都应该是增产粮食。在我国这样人口众多的国家，在农业机械化尚未实现的情况下，要想消灭粮食实产量和需要量二者之间的差额，还必须进行好多年的努力。在这期间以内，粮食问题，很可能不断地表现为一个紧张的问题。斯大林同志在苏联第一个五年计划开始的时候，在“联共（布）第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论”中说：“在乡村经济上在我们面前摆着下列的问题：（一）巩固原料植物的地位底问题，其方法就是保证在那些区内有足量的贱价的粮食生产品。（二）提高畜牧业和解决肉类问题，其方法就是保证那些区内有充分的五谷产品和草料。（三）彻底解决五谷问题，这是现在乡村经济的主要问题。这样看来，五谷问题是乡村经济中的基本问题，是解决一切其他问题的钥匙。”我们在国家有计划进行经济建设刚刚开始的时候，如果放松粮食生产而用主要力量去生产经济作物，显然就是不正确的了。
    当然，由于我国现在的农村经济还是以小农经济为主体的，这就绝对不能采用直接计划、命令执行的方法，强使农民增产粮食，而只能采取通过市场活动的经济工作方法和农民所能接受的政治工作方法来实现它。几年以来，人民政府采取了奖励经济作物的政策，曾使农民由于种植经济作物而获得了莫大的利益，引起农民继续大量种植经济作物的兴趣。现在，人民政府在全国棉花生产已能保证目前棉纺织业和民用絮棉需要的新条件下，为了奖励种植粮食作物，又规定了一九五三年棉粮的合理比价和正常的季节差价，适当地提高了粮食的价格，这样就可能引导农民多种粮食作物。各级干部应该以政务院财政经济委员会规定的新的棉粮比价为标准，向农民普遍地进行正确的宣传，说明增产粮食对于国家的经济建设和对于农民都有好处，动员农民把棉田种植面积稳定在一九五二年的水平，既不要再增加也不要过分减少。而要把注意力集中在提高单位面积产量上。这一宣传工作必须在春耕播种以前做完做好。同时我们应该集中全部力量，加强对于粮食生产的领导，严防粮食作物种植面积的缩小，保证百分之百地完成粮食播种计划，并且采用各种方法，在农业贷款、技术指导等方面，帮助农民提高粮食单位面积产量。采用正确的价格政策、妥善的经济帮助和说服教育的方法，我们是可以领导农民完成增产粮食的重大任务的。按现在情况看来，我国的粮食是可以够用的。继续增产粮食，可以进而解决储备问题，以便顺利地保证国家工业化的建设计划，不致发生意外困难。
    为了配合粮食增产任务，我们还必须合理地运用现有的商品粮食。粮食工作部门应该集中一切力量，作好商品粮食的调运、供应工作。现在我们国家掌握的商品粮食足够供应市场的需要，但储存地区分散，粮种和分布地区不平衡，如果调运、调剂工作做得不好，也会把事情弄得紧张起来。因此，粮食部门必须把必要的商品粮食集中在便于机动的位置上，首先保证大、中城市和工矿地区的需要，并有计划地调剂经济作物区和缺粮区所需要的粮食。我们有足够力量解决这些地区的季节性的缺粮现象。惜售思想是错误的。问题在于粮食工作者能否了解和掌握各地市场需要粮食的情况，能否定出和实行合理的调运计划，能否适当地掌握地区差价和批发、零售差价，及时收售粮食。我们只要作好了这些工作，同时加强市场管理，防止不法商人乘着粮食旺销季节进行投机捣乱，就完全可以稳定粮食市场。
    配合增产粮食和增加储备的任务，在广大消费者，特别是城市居民中间提倡节约粮食，也是可行的有益的措施。一两年以来，许多城市的居民产生了一种过分要求吃精米精面的风气，粮食消耗量日渐增多。市民要求吃得好一点，这是完全应该的。但国家储备适当数量的粮食，更是完全应该的。粮食消费者决不能只顾每天的消耗，而应该考虑全年的需要；而且米面制造过精，必然减少粮食的营养。据统计，去年生产的稻谷和小麦，每百斤如果能够增出两斤大米和面粉，足够六百万人吃一年，这是一个十分巨大的数字。因此，根据现有机制米面的实际情况，应该适当降低加工精度，以节省原粮、增加成品、扩大社会储备。当然，由于各地粮食的质量不尽相同，目前很难规定全国统一的加工标准；但根据节约消耗、增加营养、照顾居民生活习惯等原则，规定地区性的加工标准，却是必要和可能的。
    过去三年以来，我们争取了连续的丰收，使国家的粮食情况发生了极为有利的变化。今年我们必须以更大的努力，争取再一个丰收年，完成和超额完成国家增产粮食的计划。我们只要在农业战线上不断获得胜利，就可以给国家大规模经济建设提供可靠的物质保证。
