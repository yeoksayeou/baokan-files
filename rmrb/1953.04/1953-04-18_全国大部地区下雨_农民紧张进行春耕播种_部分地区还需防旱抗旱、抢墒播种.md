Xinhua News Agency, 17th. From late March to early April, during the tense period of spring plowing and sowing, most parts of the country had rain. At present, spring wheat in the Northeast and Northwest regions has basically been sown, winter wheat in the Yangtze River basin is bolting and heading, rice fields in the South are soaking seeds and raising seedlings, and early rice fields in Hainan Island, Guangdong, Fujian and other places have begun transplanting seedlings. Most of the cultivated land for autumn crops in the North has been plowed and harrowed and sowing has begun.

The widest rainfall occurred in the Yangtze River basin. The rainfall in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces was relatively concentrated. From April 1st to 10th, Linchuan County in Jiangxi Province, which had the largest rainfall, received a total of 119.7 mm, while Fuliang County, which had relatively poor rainfall, also received 38.8 mm. From April 5th to 10th, the entire Hunan Province had rain. In Jiangsu Province, located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from March 25th to April 9th, Liyang, Suzhou, Nantong, Taizhou, Huaiyin and other places had rainfall of 40 mm to 70 mm. After the winter wheat received rain, the seedlings turned healthy. In Sichuan Province, located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the average rainfall in the past half month was 31.4 mm. The mountainous areas, which were originally arid, now have flourishing spring crops of wheat, peas, and broad beans. Farmers are taking advantage of the rain to plow and turn the soil to sow rice, corn, and peanuts. The next highest rainfall occurred in Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces. These provinces all received rain successively from late March to early April. The average rainfall in 21 counties in Guangxi Province reached 33.1 mm. Guizhou Province generally has sufficient rainfall. Guangdong Province generally has uniform rainfall, and the seedlings are growing lushly. Yunnan Province has extremely minimal rainfall in various places. Because of the lack of rain and snow last winter in the Yellow River basin, this spring rain is even more valuable. In March, Shandong Province received rain, and generally areas can sow in a timely manner. Henan Province, Shanxi Province in late March, northern Hebei Province, eastern Suiyuan Province and southwestern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region from April 3rd to 4th, also had a spring rain. Anyang, Linxian, Yexian and other places in Henan Province, which have been experiencing drought, can now sow cotton because of the spring rain. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, rainfall of 7 mm to 9 mm occurred on the 10th and 11th. After the rain, the farmers are busy tidying up the cotton fields, harrowing and preserving soil moisture, and preparing for sowing. In early April, most areas of Northeast China also had rain.

However, the rainfall was uneven in various places. In Hunan, Fujian, Guangxi and other places, the rain lasted too long, and some small seedlings became rotten. In some areas of Anhui and Henan provinces, spring snow, hail, and frost fell in late March, which had some impact on wheat and spring crops. In most areas of Hebei Province in North China, northern Shanxi Province, southeastern Suiyuan Province, the Hexi Corridor in Northwest Gansu Province, and parts of Rehe Province, Jilin Province, western Liaoning Province, and Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China, due to the particularly little rain and snow last winter, the drought has not been fundamentally relieved after this rain, and efforts are still needed to prevent and combat drought and seize the opportunity to sow.

    全国大部地区下雨
    农民紧张进行春耕播种
    部分地区还需防旱抗旱、抢墒播种
    【新华社十七日讯】三月下旬到四月上旬正当春耕播种的紧张期间，全国大部分地区都下了雨。现在，东北、西北地区的春小麦已基本播种完毕，长江流域的小麦正在拔节孕穗，南方的稻田正在浸种下秧，海南岛、广东、福建等地的早稻田已开始插秧，北方大部分秋季作物的耕地都已耕耙，开始播种。
    这场春雨下得最广的是长江流域。湖北、江西、湖南三省雨量都较集中。四月一日到十日，江西省降雨量最大的临川县，共落了一百一十九点七公厘，较差的浮梁县也下了三十八点八公厘。四月五日到十日，湖南全省都有雨。地处长江下游的江苏省，从三月二十五日到四月九日，溧阳、苏州、南通、泰州、淮阴等地降雨四十公厘到七十公厘，冬小麦得雨后，麦苗都转健旺。长江上游的四川省，最近半月内平均降雨三十一点四公厘，原呈旱象的山区，现在小春作物小麦、豌豆、蚕豆都生长得茂盛，农民正趁雨后犁田翻土，播种水稻、玉米、花生。其次是广东、广西、贵州、云南等省。这些省份在三月下旬到四月上旬都先后得雨。广西省二十一个县平均降雨量达三十三点一公厘。贵州省一般雨水充足。广东省一般雨量均匀，秧苗都长得油绿。云南省各地降雨量极微。黄河流域因去年冬季雨雪稀少，所以这场春雨更加可贵。三月份，山东省已得雨，一般地区可适时播种。河南省、山西省在三月下旬，河北省北部、绥远省东部和内蒙古自治区西南部在四月三日到四日，也都下过一场春雨。河南省已有旱情的安阳、林县、邺县等地，因为得了春雨，棉花就可以下种。陕西省关中地区，十日、十一日降雨七公厘到九公厘。雨后，农民们都紧张整理棉田，耙耱保墒，准备播种。四月上旬，东北大部地区也都有雨。
    但是，这次春雨各地的雨量是不均匀的。湖南、福建、广西等地，因雨下的时间太长，有的小秧发生糜烂。安徽、河南等省部分地区，在三月下旬还下了春雪、冰雹和霜，小麦和小春作物受到一些影响。在华北的河北省大部地区、山西省北部、绥远省东南部、西北的甘肃河西走廊一带和东北的热河省、吉林省、辽西省、黑龙江省部分地区，因去冬雨雪特少，所以这次雨后，旱象仍未基本解除，还需作防旱抗旱、抢墒播种的努力。
