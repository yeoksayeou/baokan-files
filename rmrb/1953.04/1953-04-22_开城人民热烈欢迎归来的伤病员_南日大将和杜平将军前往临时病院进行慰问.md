Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 21st: The first group of sick and wounded captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side who have returned to the embrace of the motherland have received a warm welcome and been properly resettled.

On the afternoon of the 20th, General Nam Il, representing the Korean People's Army, and General Du Ping, representing the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, went to the temporary hospital to express their concern and sympathy to the returning sick and wounded comrades.

The people of Kaesong warmly welcomed their sons and brothers who had returned to the embrace of the motherland. At eight o'clock in the morning on the 20th, many citizens from the city and farmers from the suburbs, wearing new clothes and waving the national flags of China and Korea, rushed to the roadside near the temporary hospital to wait for the wounded and sick soldiers returning from Panmunjom. A pine branch archway was erected in front of the temporary hospital, with the solemn and beautiful national flags of China and Korea flying on the archway, as well as slogans written in Chinese and Korean: "Welcome Returning Comrades Back to the Embrace of the Motherland!"

The ambulances carrying the sick and wounded captured personnel arrived. Teenagers, young women, and elderly people in the welcoming crowd waved national flags, waved their hands, shouted welcoming slogans, and sang welcoming songs. The returning wounded and sick soldiers were moved to tears and waved to the welcoming crowd.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army cultural troupe also sent a慰问小组(comfort group) to visit the sickrooms and bring comfort bags shipped from China.

After disinfection, haircuts, and bathing, the returning wounded and sick soldiers excitedly put on brand-new clothes from their own country. They were quickly settled into warm and comfortable wards. Many people were still moved to tears. Several wounded and sick soldiers said: The motherland's concern for us makes us too moved. The strength of the motherland makes us too excited. It is precisely because the motherland is strong that the enemy released us.

The wounded and sick soldiers were also eager to pour out the torture they had suffered in the enemy's detention camps. A People's Army soldier who was missing his right arm said that in May 1952, he and other comrades on Geoje Island refused to sign the so-called "voluntary repatriation" "petition," and the enemy threw grenades at them. His right-hand fingers were blown off. It wasn't until a week later that the enemy treated him carelessly, resulting in the wound festering, and the enemy cut off his right arm.

Under the careful care of Korean medical personnel, the returning sick and wounded soldiers have begun to rest quietly. Open smiles gradually appeared on their emaciated faces.

    开城人民热烈欢迎归来的伤病员
    南日大将和杜平将军前往临时病院进行慰问
    【新华社开城二十一日电】重回祖国怀抱的第一批朝中病伤被俘人员得到了热情的欢迎和妥善的安置。
    二十日下午，南日大将代表朝鲜人民军，杜平将军代表中国人民志愿军，前往临时病院对归来的病伤同志表示关切和慰问。
    开城市人民热烈欢迎重新回到祖国怀抱的子弟们。二十日早晨八点钟，许多城内的市民和市郊的农民就穿着新衣，打着中朝两国国旗，赶到临时医院附近的公路旁，等待从板门店归来的伤病员。临时医院前搭着松枝牌楼，牌楼上飘扬着庄严美丽的中朝两国国旗，还有用中朝两国文字写的标语：“欢迎归来同志重回祖国怀抱！”
    载着病伤被俘人员的救护车开来了。欢迎队伍里的十几岁的孩子们，年青的妇女们，年迈的老人们，都摇着国旗，挥着手，喊起欢迎的口号，唱着欢迎的歌曲。归来的伤病员被感动得眼里含着泪花，连向欢迎群众挥手。
    中国人民志愿军文工团也派出慰问小组到各病室慰问，并带去从中国运来的慰问袋。
    在消毒、理发、沐浴以后，归来的伤病员都兴奋地换上了崭新的自己祖国的衣服。他们迅速地被安置到温暖舒适的病房中去。许多人仍然激动得流泪。好几个伤病员都说：祖国对我们的关心使我们太感动了。祖国的强大使我们太兴奋了。正是因为祖国强大，才使敌人把我们放了回来。
    伤病员们也急切地想倾诉他们在敌人拘留下所受的折磨。一个缺了右臂的人民军战士说，一九五二年五月，他在巨济岛和其他同志们拒绝在所谓“自愿遣返”的“请愿书”上签名，敌人就对他们投掷手榴弹。他被炸去右手手指。一直到一个星期以后，敌人才马马虎虎地给他治疗了一下，结果伤口溃烂，敌人就把他的右臂割掉了。
    在朝中医务人员的细心照顾下，归来的伤病员已经开始安静地休息。他们消瘦的脸上逐渐出现了开朗的笑容。
