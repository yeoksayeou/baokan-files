Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The London "Daily Worker" reported on the 20th that over eighty representatives from fifty organizations and groups in the English Midlands held a meeting on Sunday, demanding peace in Korea and the lifting of trade restrictions against China. The meeting was convened by the Nottingham City and Nottingham District Committee and called for an end to the Korean War.

Organizations from the following regions participated in the meeting: Derby, Leicester, Mansfield, Chesterfield, and Nottingham. Trade unions participating in the meeting included the Derby County Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, other branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and two branches of the National Union of Mineworkers. In addition, five peace committees also sent representatives to the meeting.

Dixon, Chairman of the Coventry Trades Council and a member of the municipal council, said that the whole world was rejoicing over the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war in Korea. Dixon called for the lifting of trade restrictions against China. He pointed out that the workers were very dissatisfied that Coventry workers could not export the tractors they manufactured to China, which was in need of them, due to "export obstacles."

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Singapore News: As the economic situation in Malaya further deteriorates, the "embargo" policy pursued by the British colonial government is arousing increasingly widespread opposition from all levels of Malayan society.

For two years, the prices of Malaya's main exports, rubber and tin, have plummeted under the impact of the "embargo" policy and the US policy of driving down prices. In early April of this year, the price of rubber even fell to a miserable six and a half Malayan cents per pound, only 27% of the peak price in 1951. Following a trade deficit of over 53 million Malayan dollars last year, foreign trade continued to show a deficit in January and February of this year, with the deficit for the two months nearing 10 million dollars. The value of imports and exports in February decreased by more than 30 million dollars compared to January. As a result of the widespread shrinking of industry and commerce, the number of unemployed is constantly increasing. More than 1,300 people per month are registered with the British colonial government's labor department in Singapore seeking employment. In addition, about 1,100 people are registered at the employment office at the British naval base, and about 800 people are registered at the seafarers' registration bureau seeking employment. According to newspaper reports, 2,500 female rubber factory workers in Singapore were laid off at the end of March; on April 6th alone, 450 Singapore workers were laid off; and some coconut factories also shortened their working hours.

The British colonial government also recognizes the seriousness of the economic crisis in Malaya. Hemsworth, the Financial Secretary of the Federation of Malaya, said on April 6th that if the prices of rubber and tin "continue to decline at the current rate, Malaya will face a financial crisis within six months."

This situation has made people from all walks of life in Malaya more acutely aware of the damage the "embargo" policy is causing them. According to a report in the Singapore "Straits Times" on the 23rd, "the Singapore business community is increasingly dissatisfied with the embargo" and is demanding trade with the People's Republic of China. The Malayan business community believes that trade with China "is an important step in solving Malaya's current economic crisis."

    英国和马来亚人民反对美国的“禁运”政策
    【新华社布拉格电】二十日伦敦“工人日报”报道，英格兰中部五十个组织与团体的八十多位代表在星期日举行了一次会议，要求在朝鲜实现和平与解除对中国的贸易限制。这次会议是由诺定昂市与诺定昂区委员会召集的，会议要求停止朝鲜战争。
    参加会议的有下面各地区的组织：德尔柏、雷斯忒、曼斯菲尔德、彻斯特菲尔德与诺定昂。参加会议的工会有：混合机器工会德尔柏郡委员会、混合机器工会的其他分会与全国矿工联盟的两个分会。另外还有五个和平委员会也派代表参加了这次会议。
    考文垂工会理事会主席、市政委员会委员狄克逊说，全世界对在朝鲜交换病伤战俘一事都表示欢欣。狄克逊要求解除对中国的贸易限制。他指出，正当中国需要考文垂的工人们所制造的拖拉机的时候，由于“输出障碍”而不能输出这些东西，工人们是非常不满的。
    【新华社二十六日讯】新加坡消息：由于马来亚经济情况进一步恶化，英国殖民政府奉行的“禁运”政策正激起马来亚各阶层人民越来越广泛的反对。
    两年来，马来亚的主要输出品橡胶和锡的价格，在“禁运”政策和美国压低价格政策的打击下直线跌落，到了今年四月初，橡胶价格更惨跌到每磅马来亚币六角五分，只等于一九五一年最高峰价格的百分之二十七。对外贸易继去年入超马来亚币五千三百多万元之后，今年一、二月份继续入超，两个月的逆差数字已近一千万元。二月份的出入口价值都比一月份减少三千多万元。工商业普遍萎缩的结果，失业人数不断增加。在新加坡英国殖民政府劳工署登记寻求职业的，每月有一千三百多人。另外，在英国海军基地职业介绍所登记的，约有一千一百人，在海员登记局登记寻求职业的约有八百人。据报纸报道，在三月底，新加坡共有二千五百名橡胶工厂女工被解雇；单在四月六日那一天，被解雇的新加坡工人就有四百五十人；一些椰干工厂也缩短了开工时间。
    英国殖民政府也承认马来亚经济危机的严重。马来亚联合邦财政司的希姆斯渥斯在四月六日说，如果橡胶和锡的价格“照目前比率继续下降的话，那么马来亚在六个月以内就会遇到财政危机”。
    这种情况使马来亚各阶层人民更加痛切地认识到“禁运”政策对他们的损害。据新加坡“海峡时报”二十三日消息说，“新加坡贸易界对于禁运日感不满”，并要求和中华人民共和国进行贸易。马来亚实业界认为：和中国贸易“是解决马来亚目前经济危机的一个重要步骤”。
