Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th: The decision of the Vienna meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation to hold the Third World Women's Congress has aroused widespread response in various countries. The issues on the agenda of the Congress, such as defending peace and women's rights, protecting women, families, and children, have attracted a large number of women from various professions, political views, and religions in various countries to participate in the preparatory work and the struggle for peace.

The news that the World Women's Congress will be held in Copenhagen has greatly encouraged Danish women. Now, welcoming the World Women's Congress has become a mass movement with broad participation. The Danish Democratic Women's Federation has convened meetings of heads of local women's federations, members of women's federations, and women from all walks of life, inviting prominent figures in the women's community to hold meetings in Copenhagen to discuss the significance and agenda of the World Women's Congress, and how to carry out preparatory work. The Danish Democratic Women's Federation has printed 100,000 copies of the "Appeal to the Women of the World" from the Vienna meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and issued questionnaires to understand the most pressing issues for female workers and farmers, preparing to raise them for discussion at the World Women's Congress. Now, various forms of gatherings are being held in various parts of Denmark and in many factories to make the significance and agenda of the World Women's Congress penetrate the masses, and mobilize them to fight for peace and women's rights.

Italian women are actively preparing for the Italian Women's Congress to be held in April to welcome the World Women's Congress. "For the happiness of wives and mothers," "For the dignity and progress of the motherland," and "For world peace" are the slogans put forward on the agenda of the Italian Women's Congress. Three million copies of promotional materials about the Italian Women's Congress have been printed. A characteristic of the work of preparing for the World Women's Congress in Italy is that it has absorbed many women's groups and individuals who have not participated in the Italian Women's Alliance, strengthening the ranks of Italian women fighting for peace. In order to welcome the World Women's Congress, a national conference of miners' families and a conference of female workers are being prepared, and a delegation of women will be elected at the Second Italian National Conference on the Protection of Children to submit suggestions on children's issues to the World Women's Congress. In small family gatherings, street gatherings, and female worker conferences in various industries that are widely held, special issues related to women of all strata are being discussed, so that they realize that striving for family happiness and peace depends on everyone's efforts. At the call of the Italian Women's Alliance, 200,000 women have prepared 25,000 peace flags to take to the World Women's Congress.

In Iran in the Middle East and Finland in Northern Europe, preparations for the World Women's Congress are being widely carried out. In Iran, the preparatory work is being carried out under the slogan of "Striving to defend national independence and get rid of the colonial system." The Iranian Women's Congress will be held in April to elect representatives to attend the World Women's Congress. According to the specific requirements of women from all walks of life, Iran will also hold female worker conferences, local women's conferences, and mother conferences on children's issues. In order to raise funds for the congress and travel expenses for representatives, Iran will hold fundraising, charity sales, and charity performances. Finnish women are combining the movements of "fighting for women's rights," "defending children," and "protecting Finnish national culture against American invasion" to prepare for the World Women's Congress. On March 8th, Finland held a conference on fighting for women's rights and organized more than 100 gatherings, celebrations, and parades. Various women's groups launched competitions in the preparatory work, and the best group will receive a flag for fighting for women's rights.

In Asia, India, Japan, and Indonesia, preparations for the World Women's Congress have made considerable progress. Many newspapers in India published the "Appeal to the Women of the World," and the All-India Peace Council has passed a resolution supporting the World Women's Congress. The reports on the World Women's Congress delivered by Indian women leaders Hezeina Begum and Chakravartti at women's conferences in various places have been warmly welcomed and supported. Indian women have also elected fourteen representatives to participate in the World Women's Congress. The Preparatory Committee of the World Women's Congress in Japan held a meeting on March 19 and decided to cooperate with trade union organizations and other groups preparing to celebrate "May Day" to launch a peace movement to welcome the World Women's Congress among Japanese women. The Indonesian Women's Awakening Association has jointly formed a preparatory committee with other women's groups and has elected four representatives. Women's rights committees will be established throughout Indonesia, and the Indonesian Women's Awakening Association will hold a representative meeting in April to discuss preparations for the World Women's Congress.
