    Further Develop the Fraternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Mongolian Peoples
    Ye Shangzhi
    The Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic, invited to visit our country and led by团长占巴乐道尔基, has arrived in our capital. The Chinese people have always been concerned about the remarkable achievements of our close ally, the Mongolian People's Republic, in the great cause of building their own country, and love the vigorously developing national art of the Mongolian people. Through this visit and artistic performances of the Art Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic in our country, we can even more clearly see the glorious image of the Mongolian people bravely fighting to defend the cause of peace, as well as their happy life and joyous atmosphere of labor construction in the construction of their own country.
    I have personally seen many scenes in the Mongolian People's Republic that have made me deeply feel the brilliant achievements of Mongolian national art. At the same time, many examples convincingly prove that the Chinese and Mongolian peoples have a long history of close cultural, economic exchanges, and friendly interactions.
    However, both the Chinese and Mongolian peoples suffered from the oppression of Chinese reactionary rulers and foreign imperialists in the past. These reactionary rulers and foreign imperialists also sowed discord between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, setting up artificial obstacles to prevent free exchanges between our two peoples. Only after the Chinese and Mongolian peoples achieved revolutionary victories and became the masters of their own countries did they permanently eliminate the obstacles set up by reactionary rulers, allowing the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples to develop smoothly and limitlessly.
    The Mongolian People's Republic, directly influenced by the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, was one of the first countries to be born where the people are their own masters. For more than thirty-one years, the Mongolian people, in the victorious struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, have consolidated the people's regime and national independence, and, with the selfless and decisive assistance of the Soviet Union, have developed economic and cultural construction, transforming a previously backward nomadic country into today's happy paradise. Before the revolution, Mongolia had no industry, but now large-scale factories for machinery, electricity, oil, wool, and food manufacturing have successively appeared on the vast Mongolian territory. Between 1940 and 1945, the total output value of Mongolian state-owned industry increased by 280 percent. The transportation industry has also developed with the development of industry. Now Mongolia has one thousand kilometers of highways, and the number of trucks has increased by two and a half times in ten years. In the past, Mongolia's agricultural production was also very small, but now there are more than ten state-owned mechanized farms throughout the country. The Mongolian people's main wealth—livestock—has greatly increased in number. As of 1951, the number of livestock in the country was two and a half times higher than before the revolution, with the average number of livestock per resident ranking first in the world. Along with the rapid development of the national economy, the Mongolian people's cultural construction has also made great achievements. New intellectuals and talents for national construction are growing and increasing day by day. Now the Mongolian people are confidently marching towards the great road of socialist construction.
    The achievements of the Mongolian people are a shining example of the victory of Lenin-Stalinism in backward countries. The establishment and development of the Mongolian People's Republic cannot but have a great impact on the world—especially on the people of Asian countries oppressed by imperialism.
    Under the leadership of the late leader Marshal Choibalsan, the Mongolian people have always cared about and sympathized with the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. In particular, the joint dispatch of troops by the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union finally defeated Japanese imperialism, making an important contribution and help to the Chinese people's struggle.
    When the Chinese people won victory and established the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian people felt particularly joyful. Marshal Choibalsan once said: "The historic victory of the Chinese revolution has further consolidated the international position of the Mongolian People's Republic... opening a new era in the relations between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples." Comrade Tsedenbal, Marshal Choibalsan's successor, said when he came to our country last year: "This great victory won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong has powerfully struck at the entire world imperialist system and immeasurably strengthened the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by our common sincere friend, the holy land of the Great October Revolution, the birthplace of Leninism—the indestructible Soviet Union." This victory "has opened a new era in the relationship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples... an era of truly fraternal and sincere friendship."
    Soon after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic established friendly diplomatic relations with our country and exchanged ambassadors. Since then, the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples has developed more rapidly. On July 11, 1951, when the Mongolian People's Republic celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution, our country sent a delegation headed by Comrade Wang Zaitian, member of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, deputy commander of the Inner Mongolia Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, member of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and minister of public security, to Ulaanbaatar to participate in the celebration ceremony and visit the construction of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Chinese delegation was warmly welcomed during its stay in Mongolia. On the day of the celebration ceremony, we saw the Mongolian people holding up huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of our people, in the parade. When they passed the reviewing stand, they waved and cheered enthusiastically to the Chinese representatives. When the Chinese expatriates living in Mongolia passed the reviewing stand, the respected chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural, Bumtsend, led everyone in enthusiastically shouting "Long live the Mongolian People's Republic!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live the victorious liberation of the Chinese people!" This moving scene clearly showed the Mongolian people's love and respect for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.
    On January 26 last year, the Mongolian people's leader Marshal Choibalsan unfortunately passed away. The Chinese people mourned in unison upon hearing this sad news. Our government specially sent a delegation headed by Comrade Nie Rongzhen, member of the Central People's Government Committee and acting chief of the general staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, to Ulaanbaatar to attend Marshal Choibalsan's funeral to express the Chinese people's deep mourning for the death of such an outstanding leader of the Mongolian people.
    In the past three years, cultural exchanges between China and Mongolia have been developing day by day. Many works by Chairman Mao Zedong and many famous modern and classical literary works of our country have been translated into Mongolian by the Mongolian People's Republic and are warmly loved by the Mongolian people. In order to cultivate construction talents for our Mongolian people, our government selected five Mongolian youths last June to go to the Mongolian People's Republic to study veterinary medicine, New Mongolian, and other subjects. Our Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government specially hired Mongolian professors to teach at Peking University. In recent years, our publishing institutions have published many books introducing the Mongolian People's Republic, and have also published many articles in newspapers and periodicals to help our people further understand the history, political, economic, and cultural development, and brilliant achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic.
    In order to further enhance the friendship between China and Mongolia, the Mongolian People's Republic held a "Mongolia-China Friendship Fortnight" in Ulaanbaatar from October 1, our third National Day, to October 10. During this period, various reports were held throughout Mongolia to introduce the great achievements of the People's Republic of China in the past three years, and propaganda was carried out in various ways to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between Mongolia and China. Our government also sent a cultural delegation headed by Zhou Libo to Mongolia to participate in the "Mongolia-China Friendship Fortnight." A Chinese industrial exhibition, aimed at introducing our economic and cultural construction, was held in Ulaanbaatar.
    In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our people have repeatedly welcomed Mongolian guests to our country with great enthusiasm. And on September 28 last year, when the government delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, headed by Premier Tsedenbal, arrived in Beijing, this enthusiasm reached its peak. After friendly and harmonious negotiations between Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of our Central People's Government and Premier Tsedenbal of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the People's Republic

    进一步发展中蒙两国人民的兄弟友谊
    叶尚志
    应邀来我国访问的蒙古人民共和国艺术团在团长占巴乐道尔基率领下，已经到达我国首都。中国人民一直关心我们亲密的友邦蒙古人民共和国在建设自己祖国的伟大事业上的卓越成就，并且热爱蒙古人民蓬勃发展的民族艺术。通过这次蒙古人民共和国艺术团在我国的访问和艺术表演，我们更可以亲眼看到蒙古人民为保卫和平事业英勇斗争的光辉形象，以及他们在自己祖国的建设事业中的幸福生活和劳动建设的欢乐气象。
    我曾在蒙古人民共和国亲眼看到许多情景，使我深深地感到蒙古民族艺术的光辉成就，同时，许多事例令人信服地证明：中蒙两国人民是有着悠久和亲密的文化、经济交流与友好往来的历史关系的。
    但是，中国人民和蒙古人民过去都蒙受过中国反动统治者和外国帝国主义的压迫。这些反动的统治者和外国帝国主义并在中蒙人民之间挑拨离间，设下人为的障碍，使我们两国人民不能自由地交往。只有在中蒙两国人民取得了革命的胜利，做了自己国家的主人以后，才永远地扫除了反动统治者所设置的障碍，使中蒙两国人民的友谊得以顺利地和无限地发展。
    蒙古人民共和国是在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的直接影响下，最早诞生的一个人民自己作主人的国家。三十一年多来，蒙古人民在反对国内外敌人的胜利的斗争中，巩固了人民的政权和国家的独立，并在苏联大公无私的决定性的援助下，发展了经济和文化的建设，把一个原来是落后的游牧国家，变成了今天的幸福的乐园。在革命以前，蒙古是没有工业的，但现在，机器、电气、油料、羊毛和食品制造等大型工厂，已陆续出现在辽阔的蒙古国土上。在一九四○年到一九四五年间，蒙古国营工业的生产总值增加了百分之二百八十。运输业也随着工业的发展而日益发展，现在蒙古已有一千公里的公路，载重汽车的数量在十年间也增加了两倍半。蒙古过去农业生产也是很少的，但现在全国已有十余处国营机耕农场。蒙古人民的主要财富——牲畜，数量已大大地增加。截至一九五一年止，全国牲畜的头数已比革命前增加了两倍半，每个居民的牲畜平均头数占世界各国的第一位。随着国民经济的迅速发展，蒙古人民的文化建设也有了很大的成就。新的知识分子与国家建设的人材日益成长和增加着。现在蒙古人民正在满怀信心地向着社会主义建设大道迈进。
    蒙古人民的成就，是列宁—斯大林学说在落后的国家中获得胜利的光辉榜样。蒙古人民共和国的成立和发展，不能不在全世界——特别是在被帝国主义压迫下的亚洲各国人民中发生很大的影响。
    蒙古人民在已故的领袖乔巴山元帅的领导下，一向关怀和同情中国人民的革命斗争，特别是蒙古人民共和国与苏联共同出兵，最后击败了日本帝国主义，给中国人民的斗争作了重要的贡献和帮助。
    当中国人民获得了胜利并建立了中华人民共和国的时候，蒙古人民特别感到欢欣鼓舞。乔巴山元帅曾说过：“中国革命的历史性胜利更加巩固了蒙古人民共和国的国际地位………在中蒙两国人民的关系上开辟一个新的时代。”乔巴山元帅的继承人泽登巴尔同志去年来我国时曾说过：“中国人民在英勇的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导之下所获得的这一伟大胜利，强有力地打击了整个世界帝国主义体系，并且无可计量地加强了以我们共同的真挚的朋友、伟大十月革命的圣地、列宁主义的发源地—不可摧毁的苏联为首的和平民主和社会主义阵营。”这个胜利“在蒙古人民和中国人民的关系上已经开辟了新的纪元……真正兄弟般的真诚友谊的纪元。”
    中华人民共和国成立后不久，蒙古人民共和国即与我国建立了友好的邦交并互派了大使。自此以后，中蒙两国人民的友好合作就更加迅速地发展起来。一九五一年七月十一日蒙古人民共和国庆祝蒙古人民革命三十周年纪念的时候，我国曾派遣以中央人民政府民族事务委员会委员、中国人民解放军内蒙古军区副司令员、内蒙古自治区人民政府委员兼公安部长王再天同志为首的代表团前往乌兰巴托参加庆祝典礼，并参观了蒙古人民共和国的建设情形。中国代表团在蒙古期间受到了普遍热烈的欢迎。在举行庆祝典礼的那一天，我们看到蒙古人民在游行的行列中高举着我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的巨像，当他们走过检阅台时，特别热情地向中国代表挥手欢呼示意，而当旅居蒙古的中国侨民经过检阅台时，年高望重的蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团主席布曼增迪并领导大家热情地高呼“蒙古人民共和国万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”“中国人民解放胜利万岁！”这种令人感动的情景，清楚地表明了蒙古人民对于中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和中国人民的热爱和敬意。
    去年一月二十六日，蒙古人民领袖乔巴山元帅不幸逝世。中国人民闻悉这个噩耗之后同声痛悼。我国政府特派了以中央人民政府委员会委员、人民革命军事委员会代总参谋长聂荣臻同志为首的代表团，前往乌兰巴托参加乔巴山元帅的葬礼，以表示中国人民对于蒙古人民这样一位杰出领袖的逝世的沉痛哀悼。
    三年来，中蒙两国的文化交流在日益发展着。我国毛泽东主席的许多著作与我国许多现代的和古典的著名文学作品，已被蒙古人民共和国译成蒙文，并受到蒙古人民的热烈喜爱。为了培养我国蒙族人民的建设人材，我国政府曾在去年六月选拔了五名蒙族青年，前往蒙古人民共和国学习兽医、新蒙文和其他学科。我中央人民政府教育部并特聘蒙古教授在北京大学任教。我国出版机构近年来出版了不少介绍蒙古人民共和国的书籍，在报刊上也登了不少的文章，以帮助我国人民进一步了解蒙古人民共和国的历史及其政治、经济与文化的发展情形和辉煌成就。
    为了进一步增进中蒙两国之间的友谊，蒙古人民共和国从去年十月一日我国第三届国庆节起至十月十日，在乌兰巴托举行“蒙中友好旬”。在此期间，蒙古全国各地举行各种报告会，介绍中华人民共和国三年来的伟大成就，并以多样的方式进行宣传，以加强蒙中两国的友谊与合作。我国政府也派遣了以周立波为首的文艺代表团前往蒙古参加“蒙中友好旬”。以介绍我国经济与文化建设为目的的中国工业展览会，曾在乌兰巴托举行。
    在中华人民共和国成立后的三年中，我国人民曾以极大的热情多次欢迎过蒙古的贵宾们光临我们的祖国。而在去年九月二十八日，以泽登巴尔总理为首的蒙古人民共和国政府代表团抵达北京时，这种欢迎的热忱达到了最高峰。我中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理与蒙古人民共和国政府总理泽登巴尔经过友好与融洽的谈判后，于去年十月四日签订中华人民共和国与蒙古人民共和国的经济及文化合作协定。周恩来总理在签订协定之后的致词中，指出了这个协定的重大意义，他说：“这个文件在中蒙两国关系的历史上写下了新的一页。……这个协定不仅加强了中蒙两国的深厚友谊与永久合作，而且也加强了两国人民的共同和平事业，加强了以苏联为首的反对帝国主义的和平民主阵营。因而，这个协定对于保卫和平与民主的事业是一个重大的贡献。”
    在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营中，亲如兄弟紧密团结的中蒙两国人民，是保卫远东与世界和平的重要力量。
