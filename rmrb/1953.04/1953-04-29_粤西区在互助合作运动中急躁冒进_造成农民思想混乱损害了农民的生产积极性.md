The Yuexi area of Guangdong Province, in the winter of last year and the spring of this year, blindly promoted the "experience" of Liu Huikang's mutual aid team, causing a hasty and impetuous tendency in the area's mutual aid and cooperation movement. Currently, the area has organized 4,514 permanent mutual aid teams and 18,300 temporary mutual aid teams. Many mutual aid teams were formed in a rush, learning the advanced forms of Liu Huikang's mutual aid team. The phenomenon of "eating from the big pot" has also occurred frequently in various counties, which has damaged the farmers' enthusiasm for production.

Liu Huikang's mutual aid team was originally a mutual aid team in Dapi Village, Fifth District, Dianbai County, Yuexi Area. In early 1952, the land reform work team adopted the method of grouping according to household registration and formed three mutual aid teams from the farmers of Dapi Village. At that time, many farmers in the village were unwilling to join the mutual aid team, but they were afraid that others would say they were backward and afraid of not being able to borrow cattle and farm tools. Therefore, all the farmers in the village joined the team, and even landlords and rich peasants mixed in. At the beginning, Liu Huikang led the first team. He had been a peddler in the past and had some experience in sideline occupations. He borrowed some money from the bank and led the team members to engage in making tofu and grinding rice for the cooperative, earning some money. At this time, the members of the other two teams saw that Liu Huikang's team made money from sideline occupations and also wanted to engage in sideline occupations. They merged the three teams into one large team, with a total of 42 households and 184 people, under the unified leadership of Liu Huikang. In the second half of 1952, this team jointly built water conservancy projects, eliminating floods; they also made money from sideline occupations, solving the food shortage problem for some farmers. Therefore, it was rated as a model mutual aid team in Dianbai County. Afterwards, several core members of the mutual aid team wanted to make it even more "decent" and formulated a set of complex systems that were not realistic. From a formal point of view, these systems seemed very good, for example: women were allowed two days of leave per month, work was reduced seven months after conception, and a one-month recuperation period before and after childbirth, with work points still calculated; team members were given half points when sick, etc., but in practice, none of them worked. The leading cadres of Dianbai County blindly believed that this team was a good example without investigation or research. At the First Model Laborers Conference in the Yuexi Area, Liu Huikang was rated as a first-class model. In reality, Liu Huikang's mutual aid team was large in scale, the core members had low awareness, and Liu Huikang himself was only relatively capable in leading sideline occupations, but his leadership in agricultural production was poor, and there were many problems within the team. At that time, the Yuexi District Committee of the Communist Party of China suggested that the Yuexi Administrative Office send capable cadres to investigate in order to clarify the situation. The Yuexi Administrative Office then appointed the Dianbai County Head to check. However, the Dianbai County Head only sent a section chief, who still believed that this team was a good example. The Dianbai County Head also made a typical report at the Yuexi Area's Mutual Aid Team Leaders Conference based on the section chief's report. The Yuexi Administrative Office also printed the "experience" of Liu Huikang's mutual aid team into a booklet and distributed it to the people attending the meeting. The Yuexi Farmers' Daily also vigorously publicized it. At this time, the Yuexi District Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that in-depth investigation was needed before the experience of Liu Huikang's mutual aid team could be affirmed, and again suggested that the Yuexi Administrative Office send responsible cadres to clarify the situation. At that time, Qu Chu, the director of the Yuexi Administrative Office, was going to the countryside to inspect work, so he decided to go and find out the bottom line. However, when Qu Chu arrived in Dianbai County, he heard that Dapi Village was dozens of miles away from the city and the car could not pass, so he did not go down at all. At the Yuexi Area's County Heads Conference, the leading cadres of the Yuexi Area still blindly introduced and promoted the "experience" of Liu Huikang's mutual aid team. In the process of learning from Liu Huikang's mutual aid team's "experience," various places in Yuexi disregarded the specific conditions of the local area, blindly copied and applied rigidly, pursued numbers, and pursued advanced forms. As a result, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places was launched in a rush. In Donghai County, the farmers organized in a rush accounted for 60 percent of the county's agricultural households. In five townships in the Sixth District of Enping County, 152 mutual aid teams were established in less than a month because of learning from Liu Huikang's mutual aid team's "experience." From January to now this year, Dianbai County has newly established 2,601 mutual aid teams, and many teams began by learning a set of unrealistic systems from Liu Huikang's mutual aid team. In Gaozi Township, Second District of the county, 58 teams were formed in a rush in order to request government loans for sideline occupations. The phenomenon of "eating from the big pot" also continued to appear in various counties. The Deng Chuankun mutual aid team in Yangjiang County formulated 21 covenants, concentrating farm tools, fields, houses, and even pigs and dogs, and turning a poor peasant's house into a large dining hall, completely "collectivized." Some of the farmers who went to visit said: "It's really socialism, let's do it soon too!" Some said: "Sooner or later it will be socialism anyway, sooner is better than later." This caused ideological confusion among farmers and damaged their interests.

On March 28, the Yuexi District Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an emergency meeting to examine and criticize the two deviations of rash advance and laissez-faire in "organizing," and organized a 150-person inspection team to inspect various places separately. At the same time, instructions were issued, calling on leaders and work cadres at all levels to intensify their study of the Central Committee's resolution on mutual aid and cooperation and the instructions on spring plowing and production, and to effectively lead the work of agricultural production.

### 粤西区在互助合作运动中急躁冒进  造成农民思想混乱损害了农民的生产积极性

    粤西区在互助合作运动中急躁冒进
    造成农民思想混乱损害了农民的生产积极性
    广东省粤西区在去年冬季和今年春季，盲目推广刘惠康互助组的“经验”，使全区互助合作运动发生了急躁冒进倾向。目前该区组织起来的常年互助组有四千五百一十四个，临时互助组有一万八千三百个，许多互助组都是一轰而起，学习刘惠康互助组的高级互助形式；各县还不断发生“吃大锅饭”的现象，这就损害了农民的生产积极性。
    刘惠康互助组原是粤西区电白县五区大陂村的一个互助组。一九五二年初，土地改革工作队采取按户口编组的办法，把大陂村的农民编成了三个互助组。当时该村许多农民都不愿参加互助组，但害怕别人说他们是落后分子，又怕借不到耕牛和农具，因此全村农民都入了组，连地主富农也混了进去。开始时刘惠康领导第一组。他过去做过小贩，搞副业有些办法，他向银行借了些钱，领导组员从事磨豆腐及替合作社磨米等工作，赚了一些钱。这时其他两个组的组员看见刘惠康组搞副业赚了钱，也想搞副业，他们就把三个组合为一个大组，共四十二户，一百八十四人，由刘惠康统一领导。一九五二年下半年，这个组共同修水利，免除了水灾；搞副业也赚了钱，解决了部分缺粮农民的口粮困难，因此被评为电白县的模范互助组。之后，互助组的几个骨干想搞得更“像样一些”，订出了一套不合实际的复杂制度，从形式上看这些制度好像很不错，例如：妇女每月准假二天，受孕七个月后减轻工作，分娩前后一个月休养期，照样计工分；组员有病折半计分等，但实际上都行不通。电白县的领导干部没有经过调查研究，就盲目地认为这个组是个好典型。在粤西区第一届选举劳动模范会议上，刘惠康被评为一等模范。实际上刘惠康互助组组织庞大，骨干觉悟低，刘惠康本人只是领导搞副业比较有办法，对农业生产领导差，组内问题很多。当时中共粤西区党委为了摸清情况，曾建议粤西行署派得力干部下去调查。粤西行署随即指定电白县长前往检查。但电白县长只派了一个科长下去，结果仍认为这个组是个好典型。电白县长并根据这个科长的报告，在粤西区全区互助组长会议上作了典型报告。粤西行署也把刘惠康互助组的“经验”印成小册子，散发给参加会议的人，粤西农民报也大力宣传。这时中共粤西区党委认为需要深入调查，始能肯定刘惠康互助组的经验，又建议粤西行署派负责干部去摸清情况。当时粤西行署办公室主任区初正要下乡检查工作，就决定由他顺便前往摸底。但区初到了电白县城，听说大陂村距城数十里，汽车不通，就根本没有下去。在全粤西区县长会议上，粤西区领导干部仍盲目地把刘惠康互助组的“经验”加以介绍推广。粤西各地在学习刘惠康互助组的“经验”中，不顾当地的具体条件，盲目地硬搬硬套，追求数字，追求高级形式。结果影响所及，各地的互助合作运动一轰而起。东海县一轰而组织起来的农民，占全县农业户口百分之六十。恩平县六区五个乡，因为学习刘惠康互助组“经验”，不到一个月就搞起一百五十二个互助组。电白县从今年一月到现在，全县新成立了二千六百零一个互助组，而且不少组一开始就学习刘惠康互助组一套不合实际的制度。该县二区高梓乡，为了请求政府贷款搞副业，一下轰起五十八个组。“吃大锅饭”的现象，各县也不断出现。阳江县邓传琨互助组，订出了二十一条公约，把农具、田地、房屋，甚至连猪狗都集中起来，并把一户贫农的房子修成大饭厅，完全“集体化”了。前往参观的农民有的说：“真是社会主义了，我们也快搞吧！”有的说：“迟早总是社会主义，迟不如早好。”这就造成农民思想混乱，损害了农民的利益。
    三月二十八日中共粤西区党委召开紧急会议，检查批判了“组织起来”中的急躁冒进和放任自流的两种偏向，并组织了一个一百五十人的检查组，分别到各地检查。同时并发出指示，号召各级领导和工作干部加紧学习中央关于互助合作的决议和春耕生产的指示，切实领导好农业生产工作。
