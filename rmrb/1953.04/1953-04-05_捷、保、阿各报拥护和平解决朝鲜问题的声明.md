Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 4th: Czechoslovak, Bulgarian, and Albanian newspapers published commentaries on the 3rd, endorsing the statements by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Korean Premier Kim Il Sung, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

    The editorial in the Czechoslovak newspaper "Rude Pravo" stated: The statements made by the Premier of the People's Republic of China and the Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on March 30th and 31st respectively, are noble peace proposals from the Chinese and Korean peoples. These clear statements have received the full support of the Soviet Union. The joint proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides allow for a just solution to the prisoner of war repatriation issue. The editorial emphasized that this is a historically significant contribution to safeguarding the peace and security of freedom-loving countries in the Far East, and also a contribution to consolidating world peace.
    The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial titled "A New Proof of the Desire for Peace," saying: The Bulgarian people wholeheartedly welcome the peace proposals put forward by the Chinese and Korean sides. They earnestly hope that the Korean War launched by the imperialists can be ended, and that peace can be achieved in the Far East and throughout the world. The Bulgarian people, along with billions of honest people around the world, insist that the new peace proposals put forward by the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should be accepted. The editorial in the Bulgarian "Otechestven Front" pointed out that the Bulgarian people wholeheartedly support the three statements from China, Korea, and the Soviet Union.
    The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" wrote: The new proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides once again demonstrate their willingness to reach a ceasefire in a spirit of mutual compromise. Currently, if the U.S. side also expresses the same desire, then all the conditions for reaching a ceasefire will be in place. A ceasefire is the demand of all peace-loving people. The Albanian people, like all peace-loving people around the world, resolutely support the new proposals from the Chinese and Korean sides and support the Soviet Union's position. "Zeri i Popullit" also emphasized that Foreign Minister Molotov's statement once again proves to the world the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful policy of striving for a just and peaceful solution to the Korean question.
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The London "Daily Worker" on April 1st published many representative conversations illustrating how British mothers are responding to Premier Zhou Enlai's proposals regarding the Korean armistice negotiations. Mrs. Theresa Campbell of Liverpool, whose son was captured in Korea, said: "...I personally think that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai has done a wonderful thing. In any case, the United States will no longer have any excuses this time."
    Mrs. Richards of Hammersmith, whose son-in-law was said to have been captured in March 1951, said: "I think this is a very good suggestion. We all want our children back quickly. The sooner an agreement is reached, the better for everyone."

    捷、保、阿各报拥护和平解决朝鲜问题的声明
    【新华社布拉格四日电】捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚各报三日发表评论，拥护我国周恩来总理、朝鲜金日成首相和苏联莫洛托夫外长关于和平解决朝鲜问题的声明。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论说：中华人民共和国总理和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相在三月三十日和三十一日分别发表的声明是中国人民和朝鲜人民崇高的和平建议。这些明确的声明得到了苏联的全力支持。中朝方面的联合建议使战俘遣返问题可以得到公正的解决。社论着重指出：这对于保卫远东爱好自由的国家的和平和安全是一个有历史意义的贡献，对于巩固世界和平也是一个贡献。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”以“争取和平愿望的一个新证明”为题发表社论说：保加利亚人民衷心地欢迎中朝方面所提出的和平建议。他们热烈地希望帝国主义者所发动的朝鲜战争能够结束，远东和全世界能够得到和平。保加利亚人民和全世界亿万正直的人一起，坚持应接受中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所提出的新的和平建议。保加利亚“祖国阵线报”的社论指出：保加利亚人民衷心地拥护中、朝、苏的三个声明。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”写道：中朝方面新的建议再一次表示了它们愿意在互相让步的精神下达成停战。目前，假使美方也表示同样的愿望，那末达成停战的一切条件都齐备了。停战，这是全体爱好和平人民的要求。阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民一样，坚决地拥护中朝方面的新建议，拥护苏联的立场。阿尔巴尼亚人民希望尽速结束朝鲜战争和保证中朝人民在联合国的合法代表权。“人民之声报”并强调指出：莫洛托夫外长的声明又一次向全世界证明了苏联一贯为公正与和平地解决朝鲜问题而努力的和平政策。
    据新华社讯：四月一日伦敦“工人日报”刊载了许多说明英国母亲们如何响应周恩来总理关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的建议的有代表性的谈话。利物浦的特利莎·康贝尔太太的儿子在朝鲜被俘，她说：“……我个人认为，中国周恩来总理做了一件顶好的事。无论如何，美国这一次再也不能有什么借口了。”
    汉麦斯密斯的理查兹太太的女婿据说曾于一九五一年三月被俘，她说：“我认为这是非常好的建议。我们都要孩子们赶快回来。协议愈快达成，对大家就愈好。”
