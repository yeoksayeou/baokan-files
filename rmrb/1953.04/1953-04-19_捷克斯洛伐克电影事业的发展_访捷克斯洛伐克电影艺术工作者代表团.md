    The Development of Czechoslovakian Cinema
    —An Interview with the Delegation of Czechoslovakian Film Artists
    Yè Yáo
    Miroslav Fábera, the head of the Czechoslovakian Film Artists Delegation who was invited to China to participate in the "Czechoslovak Republic Film Week," is the Vice Chairman of the Feature Film Committee of the Barrandov National Film Studio in Czechoslovakia and a well-known screenwriter. He introduced the development of Czechoslovakian cinema to the reporter. From 1946 to 1952, Czechoslovakia produced a total of 140 feature films and documentaries, which played a significant educational role for the Czechoslovakian people. He said that the development of Czechoslovakian cinema is divided into two periods: the first period before April 1950, and the second period after April 1950. The turning point between these two periods was the promulgation of the "Decision of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party on the Creative Tasks of Czechoslovakian Cinema" in 1950. This decision established the basic direction for Czechoslovakian cinema and put forward important tasks for Czechoslovakian filmmakers. Through arduous efforts, Czechoslovakian film artists mastered the creative method of socialist realism and overcame the tendencies of formalism and dogmatism that existed in past film creations. Now, they are still striving to thoroughly implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Several films produced in 1952, such as "Tomorrow Everywhere is Joyful Song and Dance" and "Proletarian Anna," have been praised by the Party. This year, they will produce twenty-two films, fifteen of which are in color. Fábera said: "This year is the year we transition from black and white films to color films."
    Regarding the issue of screenwriting, they have already prepared eleven screenplays for next year in March of this year. In the past, the biggest problem in their film industry was the "screenplay famine." Fábera said: "According to our experience, what kind of script produces what kind of film. A good film cannot be produced from a bad script." Therefore, they not only put great effort into creating screenplays, but also specifically stipulate that the screenplay must be prepared six months before the film is shot, so that these screenplays have the possibility of gradually achieving perfection. The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party instructed the Czechoslovak Writers' Union to establish a film scriptwriting committee to attract outstanding writers and playwrights to participate in film creation. This film scriptwriting committee has played a significant role in improving film scriptwriting. Seventy percent of the film scripts in 1953 were written by famous Czechoslovak playwrights. These valuable experiences are worth learning from by our Chinese filmmakers.
    Another representative, Iman Kanela, is the director of the Czechoslovak Military Film Studio. He introduced the production of Czechoslovak military films. He said that the task of their military film studio is to fully utilize the tool of film to reflect the life of the troops and exchange advanced experience in military science. They have not only filmed many good documentaries, but also distributed news briefs for the troops, and are preparing to write scripts for feature films. The excellent documentaries they have filmed include: "The Military Parade on Czechoslovak Army Day in 1951" (the director of this film won the National Prize), "Victorious Advance," "Great Day," and "They Shall Not Pass." These films are not only enthusiastically welcomed by the troops, but also loved by the people of Czechoslovakia.
    The famous Czechoslovak actor, Julius Bangik, won the National Prize for playing Baro in the film "Water Dam." He said that Slovakia used to be a relatively backward agricultural area, but now it has been built into a very advanced industrial area. Before 1945, there were only two theaters and no film studio. Now, fourteen theaters have been established and a well-equipped film studio has been built. The actors of the theater not only perform in the city, but also tour the countryside. The film studio not only produces newsreels and documentaries, but also shoots many feature films. The Slovak Film Studio's "Katya" and "Water Dam" have been greatly welcomed at home and abroad. Because these two films raised two important issues in the life of the Slovak people: women's participation in production and farmers' struggle to build their new life. They are not only loved by the Slovak people, but also by audiences in fraternal countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. He said: "We are very happy that these two films are sent to China this time to meet with Chinese audiences."
    Antonia Hegerlikova has worked as an actress in many theaters in Czechoslovakia, and has played more than twenty roles. She has played ordinary Czechoslovak women in the films "Longing" and "Two Piles of Fire," and played the wife of the Social Democrat Budchesky in the film "The New Warriors Stand Up." She won the first prize of the National Prize for the success of playing this role. She said: "We understand that the work of actors is a work that inspires people's hearts and elevates people's sentiments, so we pay great attention to improving our ideological level and artistic level." They often study and discuss issues, read literary works, and maintain close contact with writers and the masses of people. They often lead and help the amateur artistic activities of workers and peasants, participate in writers' discussions of works, improve themselves ideologically and theoretically, and absorb the essence of mass artistic creation to enrich their own creations. They also often go to the workers and peasants to understand their lives, in order to create authentic and vivid worker and peasant characters.
    Several representatives mentioned the help of Soviet filmmakers to them. Group leader Fábera said: "The development of our film art is inseparable from the specific help of Soviet film art masters." They often discuss and study issues with Soviet film artists. Soviet film artists often encourage Czechoslovak film creation and offer well-intentioned and sharp criticisms, which play a great role in improving Czechoslovak film creation. Recently, Czechoslovak filmmakers are learning from the advanced Soviet literary and artistic theories: opposing the theory of no conflict and opposing cosmopolitan tendencies in literature. In 1953, Czechoslovakia further sent their film scripts to Moscow to discuss and analyze the ideology and artistry of the scripts with Soviet film masters, so as to further improve the quality of the scripts. The famous Soviet screenwriter Smirnova is writing a film script for the famous Czechoslovak film director (one of the representatives of the film delegation to China this time) Vladimir Volchick, preparing to be made into a film in the future. Volchick directed the feature film "Tomorrow Everywhere is Joyful Song and Dance" (this film won the "International Friendship Award" at the 7th International Film Festival), and co-produced the color documentaries "New Czechoslovakia" and "Liberated Czechoslovakia" with Soviet filmmakers. He won the Stalin Prize for directing "Liberated Czechoslovakia." He said that Soviet films had a great influence and education on Czechoslovak audiences before the war. Now, not only can the Czechoslovak people see a large number of Soviet films, but the Soviet Union also helped them establish schools and film studios to train film art cadres. He himself received great help when co-producing films with Soviet filmmakers.

    捷克斯洛伐克电影事业的发展
    ——访捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术工作者代表团
    叶遥
    应邀前来我国参加“捷克斯洛伐克共和国电影周”的捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术工作者代表团团长米罗斯拉夫·法贝拉，是捷克斯洛伐克巴兰道夫国家制片厂故事片委员会的副主席、著名的电影剧作家。他向记者介绍了捷克斯洛伐克电影事业的发展情况。捷克斯洛伐克从一九四六年到一九五二年一共摄制了一百四十部故事片和纪录片，这些影片对捷克斯洛伐克人民发挥了很大教育作用。他说捷克斯洛伐克电影事业的发展分为两个时期，一九五○年四月以前是第一个时期；一九五○年四月以后是第二个时期，这两个时期的划分是以一九五○年“捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团关于捷克斯洛伐克电影事业的诸创作任务的决定”的颁布为转折点。这个决定给捷克斯洛伐克的电影事业确定了基本路线，给捷克斯洛伐克的电影工作者提出了重要的任务。捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术工作者经过艰苦的努力，才掌握了社会主义现实主义的创作方法，克服了过去电影创作中所存在的形式主义和公式主义的倾向。现在，他们仍为彻底实现捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央的决定而奋斗着。一九五二年所生产的几部影片，像“明天处处欢乐歌舞”“无产者安娜”等都得到了党的赞许。今年，他们将摄制二十二部影片，其中十五部是彩色的。法贝拉说：“今年是我们由黑白影片转到彩色影片的一年。”
    关于电影剧作问题，他们今年三月已经为明年准备好了十一部电影剧本。过去他们电影事业中的最大问题是闹“电影剧本荒”。法贝拉说：“根据我们的经验，什么样的剧本产生什么样的影片，没有坏的电影剧本可以产生好的影片的。”因此他们不但用很大的力量创作电影剧本，而且具体规定在影片拍摄前六个月一定准备好电影剧本，使这些电影剧本有逐渐求得完美的可能。捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央曾指示捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟建立了电影编剧委员会，吸引优秀的作家和剧作家参加电影创作。这个电影编剧委员会对改进电影编剧工作起了很大作用。一九五三年的电影剧本，百分之七十是捷克斯洛伐克著名的剧作家写的。这些宝贵的经验很值得我们中国电影工作者吸取。
    另一位代表伊曼·卡涅拉是捷克斯洛伐克军事电影制片厂的厂长，他介绍了捷克斯洛伐克军事影片的制作情况。他说，我们军事制片厂的任务，就是要充分运用电影这一工具来反映部队的生活，交流军事科学的先进经验。他们不但拍摄了许多很好的纪录片，而且还发行了部队的新闻简报，并正准备编写故事片的剧本。他们拍摄的优秀的纪录影片有：“一九五一年捷克斯洛伐克建军节的阅兵”（此片导演获国家奖金）、“胜利的进军”“伟大的一天”“不许他们进入”等。这些影片不但受到部队的热烈欢迎，而且为捷克斯洛伐克全国人民所喜爱。
    捷克斯洛伐克的著名演员尤利斯·班吉克因扮演影片“水堤”中的巴罗，荣获国家奖金。他说斯洛伐克原来是比较落后的农业区，现在已建设成很先进的工业区。一九四五年以前，那里只有两个剧院，没有电影制片厂，现在已建立了十四个剧院和有了设备完好的电影制片厂。剧院的演员不但在城市演出，而且到农村巡回演出。电影制片厂不仅出产新闻纪录片，而且还拍了很多故事影片。斯洛伐克电影制片厂拍制的“卡嘉”和“水堤”在国内外获得很大欢迎。因为这两部影片提出了斯洛伐克人民生活中的两个重要问题：妇女参加生产和农民为建设自己的新生活而斗争。它们不但为斯洛伐克人民所热爱，而且为波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚等兄弟国家的观众所热爱。他说：“这两部影片，这次送到中国来和中国观众见面，我们是很高兴的。”
    安东尼·赫格里柯娃曾在捷克斯洛伐克很多戏院作演员，曾扮演过二十多个角色。她在影片“热望”“两堆火”中扮演过普通的捷克斯洛伐克妇女，在“新战士站起来”一片中扮演社会民主党人布德查斯基的妻子。她因扮演这一角色的成功，荣获国家奖金一等奖。她说：“我们了解演员的工作是一种激动人的心灵、提高人的情操的工作，因此我们很注意提高自己的思想水平和艺术水平。”他们经常研究、讨论问题，阅读文艺作品，与作家、人民群众保持密切的联系。他们经常领导和帮助工农群众的业余文艺活动，参加作家讨论作品的会议，在思想上、理论上提高自己，并吸取群众文艺创作的精华，丰富自己的创作。他们还经常到工农中去了解他们的生活，以便创造真实、生动的工农角色。
    几位代表都谈到苏联电影工作者对他们的帮助。团长法贝拉说：“我们的电影艺术的发展是和苏联电影艺术大师们对我们具体的帮助分不开的。”他们经常和苏联的电影艺术家们在一起讨论、研究问题，苏联电影艺术工作者经常给捷克斯洛伐克的电影创作以鼓励，提出善意的尖锐批评，这对提高捷克斯洛伐克的电影创作起很大作用。最近捷克斯洛伐克电影工作者正在学习苏联先进的文艺理论：反对无冲突论，反对文学中的世界主义倾向。一九五三年捷克斯洛伐克更进一步把他们的电影剧本送到莫斯科，和苏联电影大师们共同讨论、分析剧本的思想性和艺术性，使剧本的质量更加提高。苏联著名的电影剧作家斯米尔诺娃正在为捷克斯洛伐克的著名电影导演（这次来我国的电影代表团代表之一）符拉基米尔·伏尔契克写作电影剧本，准备将来拍制成影片。伏尔契克曾导演故事片“明天处处欢乐歌舞”（此片在第七届国际电影节荣获“国际友谊奖”），并与苏联电影工作者合制彩色纪录片“新捷克斯洛伐克”和“解放了的捷克斯洛伐克”。他因导演“解放了的捷克斯洛伐克”荣获斯大林奖金。他说苏联影片在战前便给捷克斯洛伐克观众以很大影响和教育，现在不但捷克斯洛伐克人民可以看到大量的苏联影片，而且苏联还帮助他们建立了培养电影艺术干部的学校和制片厂。他自己与苏联电影工作者合制影片时，也得到了很大帮助。
