    Good News
    Wang Qi
    At midnight, Cheng Gongjin, the captain of drilling rig number 28, climbed the over 300-meter-high Jianlin Mountain. Through the night fog, he saw the lights of his drilling rig. The rhythmic rumble of the rig turning, cut through the night sky and entered his ears. All of this was so familiar, so dear to Cheng Gongjin.
    For several days, Cheng Gongjin had been feeling restless, wishing he could stay by the drilling rig day and night. He thought to himself, taking three steps at a time, he arrived at the drilling rig house. Before he could speak, many voices told him at once: "Captain! We've struck ore!"
    Report the Good News to the Geology Team First
    As soon as Cheng Gongjin heard the news, he picked up the telephone to call the geology team. It was almost one o'clock in the morning, and everyone had already left work; the phone didn't connect. He waited, feeling that the night had never been so long. Finally, day broke, and at six o'clock in the morning, he called the geology team, the first thing he said was: "I have great news to tell you." Before he could finish, the other party happily asked: "Have you struck ore?" Cheng Gongjin raised his voice and said: "Exactly."
    Why did Cheng Gongjin want to tell the geology team the good news first? There is a rather tortuous story behind it.
    New Geology Brings New Problems
    Jianlin Mountain stretches for more than 900 meters, with its peak rising more than 335 meters above sea level. The mountain is very steep, and among the peaks in the Tieshan mining area, Jianlin Mountain is very prominent. It can be seen from several miles away. Ore bodies have been discovered to some extent on all the brother mountains in the Tieshan mining area, but Jianlin Mountain remains a mystery. Decades ago, many Chinese and foreign geologists came to Jianlin Mountain, wanting to determine its fate, but none of them achieved any results. The traces left by geologists on Jianlin Mountain are just a dotted line. In the past, some people had also wanted to use drilling rigs to find underground ore veins. In 1946, a drill hole was made in Jianlin Mountain. At that time, the one who drilled this hole was Cheng Gongjin.
    Cheng Gongjin is an old worker with more than ten years of drilling experience. From the forever-faded tan on his face and hands, you can see that he has been fighting against nature for many years. In the old society, Cheng Gongjin was done once he finished drilling, regardless of whether ore was found or not. After so many years of drilling work, he didn't know what drilling was all about, and no one had ever told him. After liberation, Cheng Gongjin was completely different, he truly stood up. The country wants to build, and everyone enjoys happiness, which is exactly what he had hoped for. He regarded drilling as more important than his own affairs. He was happy when ore was found, and worried when no ore was found. He said: "Drilling is not like other work, one drill is several hundred meters deep. If no ore is found, one meter costs tens of thousands of yuan, how much of the state's property will be wasted! If ore is found, that's several million tons of iron, how much benefit will it bring to the country!"
    When the 429 Team's geology team gave Cheng Gongjin the task of drilling the Jianlin Mountain ore vein, he readily agreed. Drilling 500 meters deep was a first for the 429 Team, and Cheng Gongjin had never seen it after drilling for more than ten years. But he didn't consider these things, he just wanted to find more ore for the country. He told the task to all the comrades on the drilling rig, and everyone was happy. Everyone proposed: Drill deep, find more ore, learn technology. The comrades wrote in big red characters on their favorite core boxes: "Towards industrialization, towards the happiest future." Cheng Gongjin was secretly happy: The comrades on our drilling rig are truly capable. The comrades used their hands to open up a piece of flat land in Jianlin Mountain, the drilling rig was installed, and the machine room was built. The comrades went up and down the mountain countless times to transport machines and materials, and the steep and narrow path was turned into a flat road. In a few days, the frame of the drilling rig towered high, and the huge turning sound began to vibrate in the valley.
    Drilling rig number 28 first drilled into the syenite with a hardness of more than six degrees. It hadn't finished turning the syenite, and it was already more than 100 meters deep. At this time, the syenite suddenly softened, and it turned out that the drill bit had entered the marble. Cheng Gongjin began to have doubts: "If we can't find ore, but find marble, I'm afraid there's no hope of finding ore!" He walked to the geology team in a depressed mood, only asking when the ore would be found and whether the second hole position had been determined. The comrades of the geology team told him: "When you hit the marble, you will soon find ore." But Cheng Gongjin didn't believe it, he thought, "In any case, we won't find ore." So, he left helplessly.
    Although Cheng Gongjin is an old driller who has turned himself around, he doesn't understand the geology of the turned-around society. The Tieshan Geology Team of the 429 Team went through a struggle to find the Jianlin Mountain ore vein. The mountain is very high, the ore body is buried very deep, and they spent nearly a month trekking through the entire Jianlin Mountain to understand the geological phenomena. They obtained the powerful cooperation of physical prospecting and carefully analyzed the specimens of magnetic prospecting. Last July, Soviet experts came to Tieshan, studied the data, and personally inspected the various mountains. Finally, they affirmed that Jianlin Mountain must be drilled deep. Although the comrades of the geology team arranged the position of the boreholes, they were, after all, doing it for the first time and did not have full confidence, estimating that the possibility of finding ore was only 51%. Cheng Gongjin knew this. He didn't have any confidence himself, and he knew that the comrades of the geology team didn't have much confidence either, so he was even more unsure and felt that drilling was a waste! No matter what the comrades of the geology team said, he didn't believe it.
    Cheng Gongjin had drilled dozens of boreholes in the past, and the deepest was only more than 300 meters. He had seen a lot of changes in the rock formation, but he had never seen iron ore come out of marble. In 1946, he had also drilled in Jianlin Mountain, but stopped without seeing anything. Now, after drilling so deep without seeing ore, can we find ore if we continue to drill? The old geology blocked his vision, and the more he thought about it, the more helpless he became, and the more troubled he became.
    Whose Credit Is It
    The geology of a turned-around society must reap a great harvest, and Jianlin Mountain finally found ore. Two days after Cheng Gongjin went to the geology team, pyrite, diopside and other minerals began to appear in the marble that was drilled out. Cheng Gongjin was overjoyed when he saw these minerals. Not long ago, he had drilled out such rocks, which were the heralds of finding ore. He told every comrade to pay attention, and that ore would be found soon. As soon as the comrades heard the news, it was as if a great joy was about to come, and everyone was in high spirits. They carefully took out the more than 200-meter-long iron pipe section by section from the rock formation to see if the core had turned into iron. The comrades guarded the window to see if the water flowing out of the borehole had changed color. The young comrades took water from the mouth of the water pipe bowl by bowl and took it to the light to examine it carefully. Finally, the water turned black, proving that the drill bit had entered the iron ore layer, and everyone cheered. Cheng Gongjin came to drilling rig number 28 not long after that. His heart, which had been waiting for the birth of a newborn, fell down at once. The first thing he thought of was to tell the good news to the comrades of the geology team. He told me with a mixture of shame and joy: "All the credit goes to the comrades of the geology team. I have been drilling for more than ten years, and I don't understand geology at all. This time, I began to understand: in the past, we were looking for ore in mines, but now we are finding ore where there is no mine. Only in the new society can we do this." The day before, I visited the comrades of the geology team, and they said the same thing: "Without the cooperation of physical prospecting and drilling, without the guidance of Soviet experience, and without the leadership of Chairman Mao, such great power could not have been generated, and today's results could not have been achieved!"
    The good news of finding ore in Jianlin Mountain spread throughout the 429 Team. It brought courage, new strength, and unlimited enthusiasm for building the motherland. Cheng Gongjin encouraged the comrades of his drilling rig: "We must study technology well so that we can drill 1,000 meters in the future and serve the country more!" He is leading the comrades to further reinforce the iron frame, preparing to drill for a long time, 400 meters, 1,000 meters... the deeper the ore layer, the better, the more iron, the better. Cheng Gongjin and all the comrades of drilling rig number 28 are immersed in tense and happy labor.

    喜讯
    汪琦
    深夜十二点钟，二十八号钻机机长程功金爬上了三百多公尺高的尖林山。透过夜雾，他看见了自己钻机上的灯光。钻机转动时有规律的轰隆隆的声音，划破夜空，送进他的耳鼓。这一切对程功金是这样熟悉，这样亲切。
    几天来，程功金心里很不平静，恨不得日日夜夜守着钻机。他心里想着，三脚两步就走到了钻机房。不等他开口，一下子许多张嘴都告诉他：“机长！打出矿来了。”
    把喜讯先报给地质组
    程功金一听到这个消息，拿起电话机就要给地质组摇电话。已经是午夜快一点钟了，大家早已下班，电话不通。他等着，觉得夜从来没有这样长过。好容易盼到了天亮，一早六点钟，他就打电话到地质组，开头第一句话就是：“我把大喜事告诉你们。”对方没等他说完，就高兴地问：“见矿了吗？”程功金放大了声音说：“正是。”
    程功金为什么要把喜讯先告诉地质组的同志呢？这里面有一个很曲折的故事。
    新地质学带来新问题
    尖林山绵延九百多公尺，顶峰拔海三百三十五公尺以上。山势很陡，在铁山矿区内的群峰中，尖林山是非常突出的，好几里路以外，就可以看到它的尖尖的山峰。在铁山矿区所有的兄弟山上，都多少发现了矿体，惟有尖林山还是一个谜。在几十年以前，许多中外地质学者到过尖林山，想判定尖林山的命运，但是，都没有得到什么结果，地质工作者在尖林山留下的痕迹，只是虚线一条。过去，也曾有人想用钻机来寻找地下的矿脉，一九四六年，在尖林山打了一个钻眼。当时，钻这个眼的就是程功金。
    程功金是一个有十多年钻探经验的老工人，从他脸上和手上被日晒雨淋得永不消退的焦黑的颜色，就可以看出来他是长年累月和大自然搏斗的人。在旧社会里，程功金打完了钻就算了，不管见矿不见矿。干了多少年的钻探工作，他不知道打钻是怎样一回事，也没有人告诉过他。解放以后，程功金完全不同了，他真正翻了身。国家要建设，大家享幸福，这正是他所想望的日子。他把钻探看得比自己的事还重。打钻见着矿了，他就高兴；见不着矿，他就发愁。他说：“钻探不比别的工作，一打就是几百公尺，要是见不着矿，一公尺要几十万元，要浪费国家多少财产呢！见着了矿就是好几百万吨铁，对国家有多大利益！”
    当四二九队地质组把钻探尖林山矿脉的任务交给程功金的时候，他欣然同意了。打五百公尺深的钻，是四二九队破题儿第一遭，程功金打了十几年钻也没见过。但是，他没有考虑到这些，他只想为国家多找矿。他把这个任务告诉了钻机上所有的同志，没有一个人不高兴。大家提出：打深钻，多找矿，学技术。同志们在他们最喜爱的岩心盒里写上了红红的大字：“走向工业化，走向最幸福的前程。”程功金心里暗暗高兴：我们钻机上的同志真是个个能。同志们用双手在尖林山里开了一块平地，钻机安了起来，机房盖了起来。同志们无数次地上山下山运机器、运材料，陡峻的羊肠小道被踏成了一条平平的大路。不几天，钻机的架子高高地耸起，巨大的转声开始在山谷里震动起来。
    二十八号机先在六度多硬的闪长岩里钻进。还没有把闪长岩转完，已经一百多公尺了。这时，闪长岩突然变软了，原来是钻头进入了大理岩。程功金心里开始发生了疑虑：“见不着矿，倒见着了大理石，恐怕找矿没有什么希望了吧！”他闷沉沉地跑到地质组去，只问什么时候见矿，第二个孔位定了没有。地质组的同志告诉他：“打到大理岩，就快见矿了。”但程功金还不相信，他想“无论如何见不着矿了”。就这样，无可奈何地走了。
    程功金虽然是一个翻了身的老钻工，但是，他却不懂翻了身的地质学。四二九队铁山地质组为了寻找尖林山的矿脉，经过了一番斗争。山很高，矿体埋藏很深，他们花了将近一个月的时间，踏遍了整个尖林山，了解地质现象。他们取得了物理探矿的有力配合，仔细分析了磁力探矿的标本。去年七月，苏联专家来到铁山，研究了资料，又亲自察看过各个山脉，最后肯定了尖林山必须打深钻。地质组的同志虽然布置了钻孔的位置，但是，毕竟是初次，没有十分的把握，估计见矿的可能性只有百分之五十一。这一点，程功金是知道的。他自己没有把握，又知道地质组的同志也没有很大把握，他更没有底了，只觉得钻打下去是白费！不管地质组的同志怎样说，他也不相信。
    程功金过去打过数十个钻孔，最多只打到三百公尺以上。岩层变化，他看见了不少，从没有看见过大理岩里能出来铁矿。一九四六年，他也曾在尖林山钻探过，什么都没有见就停下了，现在，打到这样深都没有见矿，难道继续打下去就能见矿吗？旧的地质学挡住了他的视野，他越想越没有办法，越想越苦恼。
    谁的功劳
    翻了身的地质学一定要丰收，尖林山终于见矿了。在程功金到地质组去后的两天，打出来的大理岩里开始出现了黄铁矿、透辉石等矿物。程功金一看见这些矿物，喜出望外。在不久以前，他曾打出过这样的岩石，它们是见矿的先声。他嘱咐每个同志要好好注意，就要见矿了。同志们一听这个消息，就像有什么大喜事马上要降临，个个精神百倍。他们小心翼翼地把二百多公尺长的大铁管一节一节地从岩层中取出来，看岩心是不是变成铁了。同志们守住窗口看从钻孔中流出来的水变了颜色没有。年青的同志一碗一碗地从水管的口上接水，拿到电灯光下来仔细地查看。终于，水变黑了，证明钻头进到了铁矿层，大家都欢呼起来。程功金就在这之后不久来到了二十八号钻机。他的一颗像等待着初生婴儿降生的心一下落下来了。他最先想到的就是要把喜讯告诉地质组的同志。他带着惭愧和喜悦交加的感情告诉我：“功劳全归地质组的同志。我打了十几年的钻，对地质完全不懂。这次，我才开始懂得：过去是在矿里找矿，现在是没有矿找出矿来。只有在新社会里，我们才能做到这样。”在前一天，我访问了地质组的同志，他们说了同样的话：“没有物理探矿和钻探的配合，没有苏联经验的指导，没有毛主席的领导，是不能产生这样巨大的力量，不能得到今天的成果的！”
    尖林山见矿的喜讯传遍了四二九队。它带来了勇气，带来了新的力量，带来了无限的建设祖国的热情。程功金鼓舞着他的钻机的同志们：“我们要好好学技术，将来好打一千公尺的钻，更多地为国家服务！”他带领着同志们正在把铁架子更加固起来，准备长久地打下去，四百公尺，一千公尺……矿层越深越好，铁越多越好。程功金和二十八号钻机的全体同志沉浸在紧张而幸福的劳动中。
