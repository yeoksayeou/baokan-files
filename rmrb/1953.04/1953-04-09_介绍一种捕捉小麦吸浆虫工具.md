    Introducing a Tool for Catching Wheat Sucking Bugs
    Zhi Guangqing, a farmer from Xingyuan Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province, created a tool for catching wheat sucking bugs in 1952. This bug-catching tool has been tested by the local people and has proven to be not only very efficient at catching bugs, but also able to overcome the difficulties of catching this pest in windy conditions and under the midday sun.
    The method of making this bug-catching tool is as follows: Use two wooden sticks (or bamboo poles) each measuring three feet six inches long and one foot six inches long to make a rectangular flat frame. Tie four legs similar to those of a seed drill to the bottom of the frame (the legs can be made of three sorghum stalks or bamboo poles tied into a triangular shape). The spacing between the legs should be based on the width of the local wheat ridges. The length should be based on the height of the wheat plants (usually about two feet), and the width of the legs should be based on the width of the ridge back. The frame and legs are covered with tough paper, and the paper is coated with sticky oil made from seven parts tung oil and three parts cottonseed oil (in areas where this oil is not available, elm bark soaked in sticky liquid, or sugar syrup, noodle soup, rice soup, etc. can be tried). The amount of sticky oil applied is about three taels each time, and each application can be used for three days. When using it, put the rope attached to the frame (see picture) around your neck, hold the two ends of the lower horizontal wooden stick of the frame, and push it forward along the wheat ridge. In this way, the sucking bugs on the wheat ears can be stuck to the frame surface, and the sucking bugs hidden in the wheat plants can be stuck to the legs of the bug catcher. After the frame and legs are covered with bugs, the bugs can be brushed off and used again.
    This bug catcher has the advantages of low cost, simple construction, easy to make, and high efficiency (it can be pushed through about twenty mu per day).
    In order to encourage Zhi Guangqing's creation, the Yanshi County People's Government commended him throughout the county last year, and also awarded him a banner and a sprayer. In order to maximize the efficiency of this bug catcher, the County People's Government also put forward three suggestions: (1) The legs of the bug catcher should preferably be retractable and movable to adapt to wheat plants of different heights. (2) The legs should be changed to an arc shape (curved inward) to reduce damage to the wheat plants. (3) A piece of thin cloth (or oily tassels) coated with sticky oil should be attached to the joint between the legs and the frame to catch sucking bugs trying to escape. These improvements can be tested in the course of popularization in various regions.

    介绍一种捕捉小麦吸浆虫工具
    河南省偃师县杏元乡农民智光庆，在一九五二年创造了一种捕捉小麦吸浆虫的工具。这种捕虫工具经过当地群众试验，不仅捕虫效率很大，并且可以克服在有风和中午日烈时不易捕捉这种害虫的困难。
    这种捕虫工具的制法是：用长三尺六寸和长一尺六寸的木棍（或竹杆）各两根，做成一个长方形的平面框子。框子下面绑上四条类似耧腿一样的腿（腿可用三根高粱秆或竹杆绑成三棱状），腿和腿之间的间隔，以当地麦垅背宽窄为准。长度以麦棵的高矮为准（普通二尺左右），腿的宽度以垅背宽窄为准。框和腿都糊上有韧性的纸，纸上涂抹用七分桐油，三分棉油混合熬成的黏油（没有这种油的地区可以试用榆皮泡成的黏液或糖稀、面汤、米汤等）。黏油的涂量每次约三两，每涂一次可用三天。使用时把框上所系的绳索（见图）套在脖颈上，手持框的下端横木棍的两端，顺着麦垅向前推进。这样就可以把麦穗上的吸浆虫黏死在框面上，把潜藏在麦棵上的吸浆虫粘死在捕虫器的腿上。框和腿上黏满了虫以后，可以把虫子刷去再用。
    这种捕虫器具有成本低、构造简单易制、效率大（每天可推二十亩左右）等优点。
    偃师县人民政府为了鼓励智光庆的这一创造，曾在去年通报全县表扬，还奖给他奖旗一面和喷雾器一架。该县人民政府为了发挥这种捕虫器的效率并且提出了三点意见：（一）捕虫器的腿最好可以伸缩活动，以适应高低不同的麦棵。（二）腿改成弓形（向里弯），以减少对麦棵的损害。（三）腿和框的衔接处缀块涂了黏油的稀布（或涂过黏油的线穗），以捕住企图逃脱的吸浆虫。这些改进办法，各地可以在推广中加以试验。
