    Overcoming Conservative Thinking in Fertilizer Management to Achieve the Cooperative's Fertilizer Supply Plan for This Year
    Zhu Hua, Chief of the Finance and Accounting Department, Second Wholesale Management Bureau, All-China Federation of Cooperatives

    Cooperatives across the country are actively supplying commercial fertilizers in coordination with spring plowing. As of the end of February, the cooperative system in the five major administrative regions within the customs had supplied more than 231,000 tons of cake fertilizer and more than 17,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to farmers, and is actively allocating and purchasing raw materials in preparation for continuous processing and supply.

    Among the commercial fertilizers managed by cooperatives, bean cake accounts for a large proportion. Over the past three years, cooperatives have organized the processing of bean cake to supply farmers, which has played a significant role in increasing agricultural production. It is appropriate for cooperatives in various regions to strive to control bean cake this year, but simply relying on bean cake or blindly competing to purchase soybeans, without actively managing various oil cakes and other fertilizers, will result in a situation where bean cake is in short supply on the one hand, and other fertilizers are not fully utilized on the other. In order to change this situation, cooperatives in various regions should gradually reverse the policy of simply focusing on soybeans in the management of commercial fertilizers, and should open up various sources of fertilizer in many ways to better meet the needs of farmers.

    According to the All-China Federation of Cooperatives' cotton purchase figures, it is estimated that more than 77 million dan of seed cotton were produced nationwide in 1952, yielding more than 51 million dan of cottonseed; the Yangtze River basin produces more than 1 million tons of rapeseed annually, and Henan, Hubei and other places produce more than 300,000 tons of sesame annually; if these raw materials can be fully utilized and processed into oil cake, the supply of commercial fertilizers can be greatly increased, further meeting farmers' requirements for increasing fertilizer application. In addition, if local cooperatives can actively organize the promotion and sale of dried manure, bird manure, silkworm pupae residue, lime, gypsum, bone meal, fish scales, and shrimp bran, etc., they can also solve many problems. The Changde Special District Cooperative in Hunan Province purchased cottonseed cake, which was burned as firewood by local farmers, as fertilizer, which greatly enriched the source of fertilizer. Now the special district cooperative has completed 95.8 percent of the fertilizer supply plan. The Liuyang County Cooperative in Hunan Province organized local lime kilns to burn lime as fertilizer, which also solved the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. These facts all show that as long as cooperatives earnestly study the situation and actively open up various sources of fertilizer, they can do a better job in fertilizer supply. But there are also situations to the contrary. Jiangxi Province could produce 70,000 tons of various fertilizer raw materials last year, but the Provincial Cooperative did not fully organize the processing of these raw materials, but instead transferred 14,800 tons of bean cake from other regions, which not only increased the cost of bean cake due to procurement in remote areas, but also failed to solve the fertilizer supply problem in the region in a timely manner. Similar situations exist in many regional cooperatives, and if they are not changed quickly, they may put themselves in a passive position.

    In contrast to the situation of managing bean cake, cooperatives in various regions lack confidence in managing chemical fertilizers. Many cooperatives had a purely task-oriented view in the promotion of chemical fertilizers last year, blindly pursuing sales figures, and did not clearly explain the policies, practices, and technologies, or even did not explain them at all, resulting in serious coercion and commandism, turning good things into bad things, and causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. This year, in the examination of bureaucracy and coercion and commandism, the above-mentioned mistakes were exposed, and then they were tied up. Eleven provinces have now requested a reduction in the plan. Among them, the Fujian Provincial Cooperative requested a reduction of 38 percent of the original plan, and the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative requested a reduction of 28 percent of the original plan. This is clearly very blind. Is the task of promoting chemical fertilizers too large? It can be said with certainty that it is not too large. Because the supply of commercial fertilizers is basically insufficient at present. Some cadres believe that "farmers do not accept chemical fertilizers and cannot promote them." Of course, farmers will not accept chemical fertilizers until they have seen their effectiveness; but when they have indeed learned the use techniques and know that using chemical fertilizers has advantages and no disadvantages, and is beneficial and harmless, the situation is completely different. The Fangkuangzi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huaide County, Jilin Province, managed 5,000 jin of chemical fertilizers last year. At the beginning, because the farmers did not accept it, the cooperative did not sell even one jin of chemical fertilizers. After the director of the cooperative studied the ideological situation of the masses, he first encouraged a farmer to conduct an experiment. In a few days, it could be seen that the crops fertilized with chemical fertilizers grew better and faster. This living fact educated the surrounding farmers, and in less than five days, the cooperative's 5,000 jin of chemical fertilizers were sold out. According to the requirements of the farmers, the supply and marketing cooperative has increased the plan for supplying chemical fertilizers this year by ten times.

    Of course, there are certain objective difficulties in managing chemical fertilizers, such as the lack of technical knowledge among cooperative cadres is a major difficulty. But this difficulty can be overcome, and it must be overcome. Last year, cooperatives in many regions combined with agricultural technology departments to hold short-term technical training classes, or used forums to impart the technology of using chemical fertilizers, which achieved good results. It must be seen that with the development of China's industry, the production of chemical fertilizers will gradually increase. For this reason, cooperative cadres should first get rid of negative emotions, replace them with patiently publicizing and educating farmers, strengthen technical guidance, and actively promote sales, so as to lay a good foundation for the large-scale promotion and use of chemical fertilizers.

    Cooperatives in various regions should, in accordance with the instructions of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, resolutely overcome conservative thinking, reverse the one-sided practice of only managing bean cake, open up sources of goods in many ways, and implement the policy of focusing on the management of various oil cakes and chemical fertilizers. We must be careful and precise in our calculations, and achieve a planned and focused approach to using bean cake in economic crop areas during the topdressing season. We must continue to implement the management principle of "local procurement, short-distance transportation, supplemented by long-distance allocation," and implement direct allocation in order to reduce losses and reduce costs. In the management of fertilizers, we must criticize the purely profit-making view and the supply system mentality, which is the key to whether the fertilizer price policy can be correctly implemented.

    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has decided this year not to handle the business of selling fertilizers on credit, but instead to provide unified loans to farmers who have real difficulties in purchasing fertilizers through the People's Bank of China. This change is beneficial to promoting cooperatives to speed up capital turnover and manage more fertilizers, and it is also completely consistent with the interests of farmers. However, cooperatives must pay attention to close cooperation with the local People's Bank of China, and conduct publicity to farmers to prevent the phenomenon of having fertilizer but no money, having money but no fertilizer, or farmers misappropriating fertilizer loans. This year, the No. 3 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, sent cadres deep into the countryside to help local farmers formulate fertilizer purchase plans. Then, the cooperative and the business office of the People's Bank of China signed a triangular contract with the loan farmers in each township, that is: the cooperative guarantees the supply of fertilizer according to the plan; the business office of the People's Bank of China guarantees the timely issuance of loans; and the loan farmers in each township guarantee to purchase fertilizer according to the plan. The farmers were very satisfied. This method is worth studying and promoting in various places.

### 克服经营肥料中的保守思想，实现合作社今年的供肥计划

    克服经营肥料中的保守思想，实现合作社今年的供肥计划
    全国合作总社供应业务第二批发管理局财会处处长　朱华
    全国各地合作社正在配合春耕生产，积极供应商品肥料。到二月底为止，关内五大行政区的合作社系统已经把二十三万一千多吨饼肥和一万七千多吨化学肥料供应到农民手中，并且正在积极调拨和采购原料，准备陆续加工供应。
    在合作社经营的商品肥料中，豆饼占着很大的比重。三年来合作社组织加工豆饼供应农民，对农业增产起了很大的作用。今年各地合作社努力掌握豆饼也是应该的，但单纯依赖豆饼或盲目争购大豆，而不积极经营各种油饼和其他肥料，其结果就会造成一方面是豆饼供不应求，另方面则是其他肥料未被充分利用。为了改变这种状况，各地合作社应该逐渐扭转在经营商品肥料中的单纯以大豆为主的方针，要多方面开辟各种肥料的来源，以便更多地满足农民的需要。
    根据全国合作总社收购棉花数字估计，一九五二年全国产籽棉七千七百多万担，可得棉籽五千一百多万担；长江流域年产菜籽一百多万吨，河南、湖北等地年产芝麻三十多万吨；这些原料如能充分利用，加工成为油饼，就可大大增加商品肥料的供应量，进一步满足农民对增施肥料的要求。此外如大粪干、鸟粪、蚕渣、石灰、石膏、骨粉以及鱼鳞、虾糠等等，当地合作社如能积极组织推销，也可以解决不少问题。湖南常德专区合作社收购了当地农民当柴烧的棉籽饼做肥料，大大丰富了肥料来源，现该专区合作社已完成供肥计划百分之九十五点八。湖南浏阳县合作社组织当地石灰窑烧石灰作肥料，也解决了肥料不足的困难。这些事实都说明只要合作社认真研究情况，积极开辟各种肥料的来源，是可以把供肥工作做得更好的。但是也有与此相反的情况。江西省全省去年可产七万吨各种肥料的原料，但省合作总社没有充分组织这些原料加工，却从外区调进一万四千八百吨豆饼，结果不仅因在远地采购增高了豆饼成本，而且也没有及时解决本区的供肥问题。类似情况在不少地区合作社都存在着，不迅速改变，就可能使自己陷于被动。
    和经营豆饼的情况相反，各地合作社对经营化学肥料却缺乏信心。不少合作社在去年推销化学肥料当中存在着单纯任务观点，盲目追求销售数字，而对政策、做法、技术交代不清甚至根本没有交代，以致产生严重的强迫命令，把好事办成坏事，引起群众很大不满。今年在检查官僚主义和强迫命令中，揭发了上述错误，于是又束手束脚。现已有十一个省要求削减计划。其中福建省合作总社要求削减原计划的百分之三十八，广东省合作总社要求削减原计划的百分之二十八。这显然带有很大盲目性。是不是推销化学肥料的任务过大了？可以肯定地说并不过大。因为商品肥料在目前基本上是不足的。有的干部认为：“农民不接受化学肥料，不能推销。”农民在没有看见化学肥料的效用以前当然是不接受的；但当他们确实学会使用技术，知道了用化学肥料有得无失，有利无害的时候，情形就完全不同了。吉林省怀德县房框子供销合作社去年经营了五千斤化学肥料，开始时因农民不接受，合作社连一斤化学肥料也没卖出去。合作社主任研究了群众的思想情况以后，就先鼓励一个农民进行了试验。不几天就看出施用化学肥料的庄稼长得又好又快。这一活的事实教育了周围的农民，这以后不到五天，合作社的五千斤化学肥料就被买光了。这个供销社根据农民的要求已经把今年供应化学肥料的计划提高十倍。
    当然，经营化学肥料有一定的客观困难，如合作社干部不懂技术就是一个很大的困难。但这困难是可以克服的，而且也是必须克服的。去年就有不少地区的合作社和农业技术部门结合起来召开短期的技术训练班，或利用座谈会形式传授使用化学肥料的技术，收到了很好的效果。必须看到：随着我国工业的发展，化学肥料的生产必将日渐增多，为此，合作社干部首先应当去掉消极情绪，代之以耐心向农民宣传教育，加强技术指导和积极推销，为大规模推广使用化学肥料打下良好基础。
    各地合作社应按照全国合作总社的指示，坚决克服保守思想，扭转只经营豆饼的单打一的作法，多方面开辟货源，实行以经营各种油饼和化学肥料为主的方针。必须要精打细算，做到有计划地有重点地适应追肥季节把豆饼用于经济作物区。要继续贯彻“就地取给，短距离运输，辅以远地调拨”的经营原则，并实行直线调拨，以达到减少损耗降低成本的目的。在经营肥料当中，必须批判单纯赢利观点和供给制思想，这是能否正确执行肥料价格政策的关键。
    全国合作社今年已决定不再办理赊销肥料业务，而由人民银行统一贷款给购买肥料确有困难的农民。这种改变对促进合作社加速资金周转、经营更多的肥料是有好处的，它和农民的利益也是完全一致的。但是合作社必须注意和当地人民银行密切配合，并向农民进行宣传，以防止有肥无款、有款无肥或农民挪用肥料贷款的现象。今年湖南平江县第三区供销合作社派出干部深入农村，帮助当地农民制定购肥计划，然后由合作社会同人民银行营业所与各乡贷款农民订立三角合同，即：合作社根据计划保证供应肥料；人民银行营业所保证及时发放贷款；各乡贷款农民保证按照计划购买肥料。农民非常满意。这种办法值得各地研究推行。
