    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 26th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation of the Korean and Chinese side issued the following communique on April 26th: On April 26th, our side repatriated a total of 84 sick and wounded POWs to the other side at Panmunjom, including 71 Korean POWs and 13 American POWs. As of this point, our side has, in accordance with Article 109 of the 1949 Geneva Convention regarding the repatriation of sick and wounded POWs during wartime, and the "Agreement on the Repatriation of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War" signed by our side and the other side at Panmunjom on April 11, 1953, completed the repatriation of all 684 sick and wounded POWs held in our POW camps and front-line hospitals. This total included 471 Koreans, 149 Americans, 32 British, 15 Turks, 6 Colombians, 5 Australians, 2 Canadians, and 1 each from the Union of South Africa, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Greece.
    On the same day, the other side repatriated 497 sick and wounded captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side at Panmunjom.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 26th: On the 26th, our side repatriated another group of sick and wounded POWs, including 13 American sick and wounded POWs and 71 Korean sick and wounded POWs. In seven days, our side has repatriated a total of 471 Korean sick and wounded POWs, which is more than 20 more than originally estimated, and 213 non-Korean sick and wounded POWs, which is more than 60 more than originally estimated.
    On the 26th, the U.S. side temporarily notified a reduction of three persons from the scheduled number of repatriates, so the U.S. side actually only repatriated 497 sick and wounded personnel of the Korean People's Army today. It is worth noting that, according to the list of repatriated personnel provided by the U.S. side, not a single officer has been repatriated so far. Among the 497 people who returned today, there were another 50 mental patients. As of now, our side has received 75 Korean People's Army personnel formally listed as mentally ill by the U.S. side. According to the U.S. side's notification, there will be another 50 mental patients on the 27th. Among the sick and wounded POWs repatriated by our side, there is not a single mental patient. From the ravings of many mentally ill patients, the reasons for their mental derangement can be found. Many people shout only one sentence all day long: "I want to return to my motherland! Let me go back!" Now, our side is patiently giving them kind comfort and care, gradually eliminating their feelings of terror, and at the same time decorating the hospital beautifully and freshly, showing them movies and plays, and trying to make them mentally happy. After a short period of treatment in the temporary hospital in Kaesong, they will be sent to the rear for specialized treatment and recuperation.

    我方收容的病伤战俘遣返完毕
    【新华社开城二十六日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十六日发表公报如下：四月二十六日，我方在板门店遣返给对方朝鲜籍病伤战俘七十一人，美籍病伤战俘十三人总共八十四人。至此，我方已根据一九四九年日内瓦公约第一零九条关于战事期间遣返病伤战俘的规定及一九五三年四月十一日我方与对方在板门店所签订的“遣返病伤被俘人员协定”，把我方战俘营及前线病院中所收容的病伤战俘六百八十四人全部遣返完毕，其中包括朝鲜籍四百七十一人，美籍一百四十九人，英籍三十二人，土耳其籍十五人，哥伦比亚籍六人，澳大利亚籍五人，加拿大籍二人，南非联邦籍、荷兰籍、菲律宾籍和希腊籍各一人。
    同日对方在板门店遣返给我方朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员四百九十七人。
    【新华社开城二十六日电】二十六日，我方遣送了又一批病伤战俘，包括美国籍病伤战俘十三人，朝鲜籍病伤战俘七十一人。七天中我方共遣返朝鲜籍病伤战俘四百七十一人，较原估计数字多二十余人，遣返的非朝鲜籍病伤战俘二百一十三人，较原估计数字多六十余人。
    二十六日美方又临时通知在预定遣返的人数中减少三人，所以美方今天实际只遣返朝鲜人民军病伤人员四百九十七人。值得注意的是根据美方交来的被遣返人员名单，迄今尚无一个军官被遣返。今天回来的四百九十七人中又有五十个精神病患者，至此，我方已收到美方正式列为精神病的朝鲜人民军人员七十五人。据美方通知，二十七日还有精神病患者五十人。在我方遣返的病伤战俘中，则无一精神病患者，从许多精神病病人的呓语可以找到他们精神失常的原因，许多人整天只喊一句话：“我要回祖国！让我回去吧！”现在我方对这些精神病病人正耐心给予亲切的安慰、照料，逐渐消除他们的恐怖心理，同时把医院布置得美丽、清新，给他们放电影和演戏，尽量使他们精神愉快。他们在开城的临时医院经过短期治疗后，将被送到后方进行专门的治疗和休养。
