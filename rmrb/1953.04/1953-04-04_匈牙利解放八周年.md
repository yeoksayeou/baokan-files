    On April 4th, the Hungarian people celebrate their liberation day. Eight years ago, on April 4th, the glorious Soviet army defeated the German fascist bandits and their ally, the Horthy gang, and completely liberated our motherland. On this joyous holiday of liberation for the Hungarian people – April 4th – they think of the great Soviet people with boundless love and gratitude. They shed their blood to win freedom for the Hungarian people and opened the way for our prosperity and development.
    The Hungarian working people, liberated thanks to the Soviet Union, under the leadership of our Party and our beloved leader Comrade Rakosi, with high enthusiasm and selfless spirit, eliminated the remnants of the feudal and capitalist systems, cleared the ruins of war, and are building a new, free, and socialist Hungary.
    Thanks to the multifaceted and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian working people, led by the working class, rebuilt our country in a very short period and began the construction of socialism. As a result, Hungary has become a country belonging to the working people. As our beloved leader Comrade Rakosi said, "We have established a new country, where a new nation, a socialist Hungary, is being formed." In the land reform movement, we liquidated the landlords and distributed more than 1.8 million hectares of land to more than 642,000 working peasant households. Due to the nationalization of banks and factories, we developed the national economy according to socialist principles; eight years after liberation, 86.6 percent of our national income comes from the socialist economy, 11.7 percent from handicrafts, totaling 98.3 percent, and only 1.7 percent from the capitalist economy. Hungary has become a country of working people. Here, all power belongs to the working people; here, all exploitation of man by man has been almost completely abolished; here, all cultural and economic resources serve the working people.
    Since liberation eight years ago, the economic, political, and cultural structure of Hungary has undergone fundamental changes. Under the wise leadership of our Party and our beloved leader Comrade Rakosi, with the selfless assistance and support of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian working people have eliminated the backwardness left over by the feudal and capitalist ruling systems. The Three-Year Plan and the Five-Year Plan have successfully transformed Hungary from a backward agricultural country into an industrial country, while agriculture has also been highly developed. After the completion of the Three-Year Plan for the restoration of the country (1947-1949), industrial production exceeded the pre-war level of 1938 by 53.4 percent. The expanded Five-Year Plan (1950-1954) will build 341 new large factories, equipped with the latest Soviet machines, and greatly expand the existing factories, so that industrial production will exceed the 1949 level by 310 percent by 1954. In the third year of the Five-Year Plan, 1952, our industrial production increased to three times that of 1939. In addition, in 1953, the ratio of industries producing means of production to industries producing consumer goods will be 60 to 40, according to the principles of socialist industrialization. Our coal production per capita has exceeded that of France, Italy, and Austria, and the production of milled iron and steel per capita has exceeded that of Japan and Italy. These facts are sufficient to illustrate the achievements of our socialist industrialization.
    As a result of socialist industrialization, our country has established new industrial sectors and is manufacturing many machines that were previously imported from foreign countries. In the past, Hungary did not produce automobiles, mining machines, and construction industry machines. Today, these things are being produced in large quantities. Our machine tool industry, precision instrument industry, chemical industry, and the manufacture of other important industrial equipment are developing vigorously. The characteristics of the development of heavy industry and its most important sector—the machine-building industry—are as follows: in 1952, our industrial output exceeded the 1941 level by 23.6 percent, the output of heavy industry increased by 33.3 percent, of which the output of the machine-building industry increased by 35 percent, and the output of light industry increased by 10.5 percent. From this, it can be seen that our industrialization is socialist industrialization, and we are laying the foundation for further economic development. According to the tasks pointed out in the Five-Year Plan, our country should become a country of steel and machinery.
    The development of our machine-building industry has greatly promoted the progress of agriculture in all aspects. Socialist industry has reduced the work of our working peasants and increased the yield per unit area. Now there are almost 400 state-owned agricultural machinery stations across the country, with tens of thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, seeders, harvesters, etc., enabling the working peasants to do their farming work better and more easily. With the help of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian agricultural machinery industry is developing rapidly. Tracked diesel tractors, potato planters, harvester threshers, combine harvesters, and various other agricultural machines manufactured in large quantities ensure large-scale mechanized socialist farming. In the Five-Year Plan, the agricultural machinery industry will manufacture 26,100 tractors, 9,060 sheaf binders and harvesters, 2,600 combine harvesters, and tens of thousands of other machines for Hungarian agriculture. By the last year of the Five-Year Plan, 1954, 90 percent of deep plowing and 50 percent of harvesting will be mechanized. In addition, the state has taken many other measures to help farmers. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the irrigated area will be increased by 180,000 hectares, which will reduce the threat of drought. Every rural area will be supplied with electricity, so that agricultural work can use electricity, and at the same time, the culture of rural areas will also be unprecedentedly developed, with cinemas and radios.
    Under the leadership of the Party and the working class, with the help of the Soviet Union, Hungarian peasants are widely participating in the agricultural cooperative movement and are moving towards socialism by leaps and bounds. Believing that collective farming is superior to individual farming, farmers voluntarily join cooperatives. In this regard, the Soviet government has given us a lot of help. Several Hungarian peasant delegations have visited the Soviet Union to study the advanced working methods of Soviet collective farmers on the spot and have gained experience in the comparative superiority of collective farming. The visit of Soviet collective farmers to Hungary has also made a great contribution to the development of the agricultural cooperative movement in Hungary. Now, the yield per unit area of cooperative land is much higher than that of individual farmers, and the Hungarian government provides cooperative members with various support. These facts have convinced more and more farmers, making them believe in the superiority of agricultural cooperatives and collective farming. As a result, in 1952, 90,000 farm households joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the land of cooperatives increased to 1,254,000 hectares. In 1952, 37 percent of arable land belonged to state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives.
    We have also made great achievements in trade. Ninety-nine percent of the growing retail trade is operated by socialist state-owned enterprises and cooperatives.
    In order to improve the cultural and educational level of the working people in accordance with the principles of building socialism, the Hungarian people's government has done everything it should do. The achievements in this area are also great. For example, one of our decisive achievements is the expansion of the eight-year school system so that every child receives compulsory education. In addition to general education, we have also established many secondary technical schools, and universities have also undergone thorough reforms. In the 1952-1953 academic year, 99 percent of school-age children have been enrolled, and the number of students who have completed the eighth grade of ordinary school is rapidly increasing. This year, there are 119,000 middle school students and 46,000 university and college students. In Hungary with a population of 9.5 million, the number of people enrolled in schools is nearly 1.4 million. In addition, the social origin of students has also fundamentally changed. In the past, knowledge and culture were the privilege of the rich, but now 67.7 percent of middle school students and 58 percent of university and college students are from working-class and peasant backgrounds. In feudal and capitalist Hungary, there were only sixteen college students for every 10,000 people. This year, this number has increased to fifty-one, that is, more than tripled. In this regard, many advanced countries in the past, such as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, or Austria, have now fallen behind us.
    Our working people are following the example of the Soviet working people.
    In 1952, theaters had 4.7 million viewers, operas and dances had 1.1 million viewers, cinemas had nearly 100 million viewers, and 830,000 people had radios (by the end of this year, it will increase to 1 million). Last year, a total of 34 million books were published. In 1952, there were a total of 1,460 regional cultural centers and 2,425 local cinemas regularly showing movies across the country. There are a total of 17,000 libraries across the country, that is, one library for every 600 people. Folk art is developing unprecedentedly and has reached a very high level. The Chinese working people can also estimate the development of Hungarian song, dance, music and other arts from the performances of the Hungarian National People's Cultural Troupe in China last year.
    In terms of sports, the Hungarian People's Republic has also achieved great results. At the Helsinki International Olympic Games, Hungarian athletes won great victories for their socialist motherland. They won sixteen world championships and forty-two gold medals.
    With the development of the national economy, politics, and culture, the living standards of the working people have greatly improved. In 1949, when the plan to revitalize the country was completed, the living standards of the Hungarian people increased by 40 percent compared with 1938, and will increase by another 50 percent by the completion of the Five-Year Plan.
    In 1952 alone, workers' incomes increased by 23.5 percent. The increase in people's welfare can be seen from the following facts: compared with 1950, the percentage increase in various consumer goods in 1952 is as follows: meat - 17.9, candy - 27.3, bread - 24, men's leather shoes - 8.6, women's leather shoes - 13.1, children's leather shoes - 28, furniture - 35.8, radios - 35.4, motorcycles - 59.6.
    The above figures can only partially explain the improvement of the living standards of the working people. The measures taken by the government of the Hungarian People's Republic in all aspects for the social welfare of the working people have also greatly contributed to the improvement of living standards and made people's lives better and better. In order to meet the needs of the working people, we are building thousands of new houses. Hundreds of thousands of working people enjoy free vacations in the summer. Measures to protect women and infants are constantly being improved. In 1952, 60 percent of the total population enjoyed the social insurance of the trade union. Our people's government, in accordance with socialist principles, believes that people are the most precious property, and therefore it does everything possible to protect the health of the working people. Thanks to the health measures taken by our government, the mortality rate of tuberculosis, a disease that was considered unique to Hungary before liberation, has decreased by 57 percent compared with 1938. Infant mortality has been halved. Due to the government's health work, the population growth per thousand people in 1952 increased by 47 percent compared with 1938. The number of marriages per thousand people increased by 20 percent compared with 1938. In Hungary, the number of hospital beds per 10,000 people is more than that in France and Belgium. The mortality rate is lower than that in the United Kingdom and Austria.
    When summarizing the achievements made by the Hungarian working people in building socialism in the eight years after liberation, we have never forgotten for a moment that all these achievements should be attributed to the constant selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. We know that our ability to defend the achievements of the Hungarian People's Republic and ensure further development, and to resist imperialist aggression, is inseparable from the friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union. We also know that if we want to defend peace and ensure the prosperity and happiness of the people, we must unite with the great peace camp led by the Soviet Union with a population of 800 million. In the spirit of proletarian internationalism, we are firmly strengthening the friendship with our liberator, the most powerful defender, and the great Soviet people. We must follow the teachings of our liberator Comrade Stalin, and we must always tirelessly increase our loyalty and gratitude to the Soviet people. In the spirit of the great Stalinist doctrine, we will continue to strengthen the close friendship with the Chinese people, who have a population of 500 million, and the people of other people's democratic countries. Following the teachings of the great Stalin, in order to defend peace, freedom, and socialism, and against the imperialist war instigators, we must further strengthen the friendly relations with the great peace camp of 800 million people led by the Soviet Union, just as our beloved leader Comrade Rakosi said: "For the great cause of peace, wherever there is a need to struggle and sacrifice, the Hungarian working people will definitely go there."

    匈牙利解放八周年
    匈牙利人民共和国驻华特命全权大使　夏法朗柯
    四月四日，匈牙利人民庆祝自己的解放日。八年以前的四月四日，光荣的苏联军队击败了德国法西斯匪军及其同盟者霍尔梯匪帮，完全解放了我们的祖国。匈牙利人民在自己获得解放的这一个欢庆的节日——四月四日，怀着无限的爱戴和感激，想念着伟大的苏联人民。他们用自己的血为匈牙利人民取得了自由，并且为我们打开了繁荣发展的道路。
    由于苏联而获得了自由的匈牙利劳动人民，在我们的党和敬爱的领袖拉科西同志的领导下，用高度的热诚和忘我精神扫除了封建主义和资本主义制度遗留下来的残余，清除了战争的废墟，建设着新的、自由的、社会主义的匈牙利。
    由于苏联多方面的无私的援助，以工人阶级为领导的匈牙利劳动人民在很短的时期内重建了我国，并且开始了社会主义的建设。结果，匈牙利成为一个属于劳动人民的国家。正如我们敬爱的领袖拉科西同志所说：“我们已建立了一个新的国家，在这里，一个新的民族，一个社会主义的匈牙利正在形成着。”在土地改革运动中，我们清算了地主，把一百八十多万公顷土地分给六十四万二千多户劳动农民。由于银行和工厂国有化，我们根据社会主义的原则发展了国民经济；在解放八年以后，我国国民收入的百分之八十六点六来自社会主义经济，百分之十一点七来自手工业，两项共计百分之九十八点三，仅有百分之一点七是来自资本主义经济。匈牙利已变成一个劳动人民的国家。在这里，一切权力都是属于劳动人民的；在这里，一切人对人的剥削差不多完全废除了；在这里，一切文化的和经济的资源都是为劳动人民服务。
    自从解放八年以来，匈牙利经济的、政治的和文化的结构都起了根本的变化。在我们党和敬爱的领袖拉科西同志英明的领导之下，在苏联无私的援助和支持下，匈牙利劳动人民扫除了封建主义和资本主义统治制度遗留下来的落后现象。三年计划和五年计划成功地把匈牙利从一个落后的农业国变成一个工业国，同时农业也有了高度的发展。恢复国家的三年计划（一九四七——一九四九年）完成后，工业生产超过了战前一九三八年水平的百分之五十三点四。扩大了的五年计划（一九五○——一九五四年）中，要兴建三百四十一所新的大工厂，装备着最新式的苏联机器，并且要大大地扩充原有的工厂，因而要使工业生产到一九五四年时超过一九四九年水平的百分之三百一十。在五年计划的第三年即一九五二年，我们的工业生产增加到一九三九年的三倍。此外，在一九五三年，制造生产资料的工业和制造消费品的工业的比例，按照社会主义工业化的原则，将为六十比四十。我国按人口计算的产煤量已超过了法国、意大利和奥地利，按人口计算的铣铁和钢的产量已超过了日本和意大利，这些事实都足以说明我国社会主义工业化的成就。
    由于社会主义工业化的结果，我国建立了新的工业部门，并且正在制造许多从前自外国输入的机器。过去匈牙利不生产汽车、采矿机器和建筑工业的机器。今天这些东西都在大量生产着。我国的母机工业、精密器械工业、化学工业以及其他重要工业装备的制造正在蓬勃地发展着。重工业及其最重要部门——机器制造工业发展的特征是这样的：一九五二年我国的工业产量超过一九四一年水平的百分之二十三点六，重工业的产量提高了百分之三十三点三，其中机器制造工业的产量提高百分之三十五，轻工业产量提高了百分之十点五。由此可知，我国的工业化是社会主义的工业化，我们正在奠定进一步发展经济的基础。按照五年计划所指出的任务，我们国家应成为一个钢铁和机器的国家。
    我国机器制造业的发展在各方面大大地促进了农业的进步。社会主义工业使我们劳动农民的工作减轻了，并且提高了单位面积的产量。现在全国已差不多有四百个国营农业机器站，有着几万架拖拉机、康拜因机、播种机、收割机等，使劳动农民的耕种工作能够作得更好而且更加容易。由于苏联的帮助，匈牙利农业机器工业正在大步地发展。履带式柴油拖拉机、马铃薯播种机、收割打谷机、康拜因机及其他各种大量制造的农业机器保证了大规模机械化的社会主义耕种。在五年计划中，农业机器工业为匈牙利农业制造二万六千一百架拖拉机、九千零六十架束禾机和收割机，二千六百架康拜因机及几万架其他的机器。到五年计划最后的一年，即一九五四年，百分之九十的深耕工作及百分之五十的收割工作都要机械化。此外，国家还采取了许多别的帮助农民的措施。五年计划规定将增加灌溉面积十八万公顷，这就减轻了旱灾的威胁。每个农村都将得到电源的供应，这样，农业工作可以采用电力，同时农村的文化也将有空前的发展，将有电影院和收音机。
    在党和工人阶级的领导下，在苏联的帮助下，匈牙利农民正广泛地参加农业合作运动，大步地走向社会主义。由于相信集体耕种比个别耕种优越，农民都自愿加入合作社。在这一方面，苏联政府给我们许多帮助。好几个匈牙利农民代表团曾经访问了苏联，到现场去研究苏联集体农民的先进工作法，获得了集体耕种比较优越的经验。苏联集体农民到匈牙利来访问，对于匈牙利农业合作运动的发展也有很大的贡献。现在，合作社土地的单位面积产量比单干农民的高得多，匈牙利政府给予合作社社员多方面的支持，这些事实都说服了愈来愈多的农民，使他们相信农业合作社和集体耕种的优越性。结果，在一九五二年就有九万农户加入了农业生产合作社，合作社的土地增加到一百二十五万四千公顷。一九五二年有百分之三十七的可耕地属于国营农场和农业合作社。
    在贸易方面我们也获得了很大的成就。日益增长的零售贸易的百分之九十九都是社会主义性质的国营企业和合作社所经营。
    为了按照建设社会主义的原则，提高劳动人民的文化教育水平，匈牙利人民的政府作了一切应做的工作。这方面的成就也是很大的。例如，我们的决定性的成就之一，是八年制学校的扩展，以便使每
    一个儿童都受到义务教育。除了普通教育，我们还建立了许多中等技术学校，大学也经过了彻底改革。在一九五二——一九五三年度，百分之九十九的学龄儿童都已入学，修完普通学校八年级的学生人数正迅速地增加着。今年中学学生人数是十一万九千，大学及高等学校学生人数是四万六千人。在九百五十万人口的匈牙利，入学的人数将近一百四十万。此外，学生的社会出身也根本改变了。在过去，知识和文化是富人的特权，现在百分之六十七点七的中学生及百分之五十八的大学及高等学校学生都是工农出身。在封建的和资本主义的匈牙利，每一万人中只有十六个高等学校的学生，今年这个数目增加到五十一个，就是说增加到三倍多。在这一方面，过去许多占先的国家如英国、法国、荷兰、瑞士或奥地利，现在都落到我们后面去了。
    我国劳动人民正在遵循着苏联劳动人民的范例。
    一九五二年，剧院有四百七十万观众，歌舞剧有一百一十万观众，电影院有将近一亿观众，八十三万人有了收音机（到今年年底，将增至一百万人）。去年共出版了三千四百万本书。一九五二年全国共有一千四百六十个地区文化馆，有二千四百二十五个地方经常放映电影。全国共有一万七千个图书馆，即是每六百人就有一个图书馆。民间艺术空前地发展着，并已达到很高的水平。中国劳动人民也可以从匈牙利国家人民文工团去年在中国的表演来估量匈牙利歌舞音乐等艺术的发展。
    在运动方面，匈牙利人民共和国也获得了巨大的成绩。在赫尔辛基国际奥林匹克运动会上，匈牙利运动员为自己社会主义的祖国赢得了伟大的胜利，他们获得了十六个世界冠军及四十二个金质奖章。
    随着国家经济、政治和文化的发展，劳动人民的生活水平大大地提高了。一九四九年，当复兴国家的计划完成时，匈牙利人民的生活水平比一九三八年提高了百分之四十，到五年计划完成时，将再提高百分之五十。
    一九五二年一年中，工人的收入增加了百分之二十三点五。人民福利的增加可从下面的事实看出来：和一九五○年比较，一九五二年各种消费品的增加的百分数如下：肉类——十七点九，糖果——二十七点三，面包——二十四，男人皮鞋——八点六，女人皮鞋——十三点一，小孩皮鞋——二十八，家具——三十五点八，收音机——三十五点四，摩托车——五十九点六。
    上述数目字仅能部分地说明劳动人民生活水平的提高。匈牙利人民共和国政府在各方面采取的对于劳动人民社会福利的措施也大大地有助于生活水平的提高，使人民的生活日益美好。为了满足劳动人民的需要，我们正在修建几千幢新住宅。成千上万的劳动人民在夏天享受到免费的休养。保护妇婴的措施不断地改进着。一九五二年全人口的百分之六十都享受到工会的社会保险。我们人民的政府遵照社会主义的原则，认为人是最宝贵的财产，因此，它竭尽一切力量来保障劳动人民的健康。由于我们政府所采取的保健措施，解放前被认为是匈牙利特有的病——肺结核的死亡率比一九三八年减少了百分之五十七。婴儿死亡率降低了一半。由于政府的保健工作，一九五二年每一千人口中人数的增长比一九三八年提高了百分之四十七。每一千人口中，结婚的数目比一九三八年提高了百分之二十。在匈牙利，每一万人所有的病床数目比法国和比利时的还多。死亡率比英国和奥地利还低。
    在总结解放后八年来匈牙利劳动人民在建设社会主义方面所获得的成果的时候，我们从未片刻忘记自己这一切成就都应当感谢苏联经常的无私的援助。我们知道我们之所以能够保卫匈牙利人民共和国的成就，并能确保进一步的发展，抵抗帝国主义的侵略，这都是和苏联的友谊和援助分不开的。我们也知道我们如要保卫和平，保障人民的繁荣幸福，就必须和苏联领导的拥有八亿人口的伟大和平阵营团结一致。本着无产阶级国际主义的精神，我们坚决不移地加强和我们的解放者、最强大的保卫者、伟大的苏联人民的友谊。我们要遵循我们的解放者斯大林同志的遗训，要永远不倦地增进我们对于苏联人民的忠诚和感激。本着伟大的斯大林学说的精神，我们要继续加强和拥有五亿人口的中国人民，和其他各人民民主国家人民的亲密友谊。遵循着伟大的斯大林的遗训，为了保卫和平、自由及社会主义，反对帝国主义战争挑拨者，我们要更加密切和苏联领导的八亿人口的伟大和平阵营的友好关系，正如我们敬爱的领袖拉科西同志所说：“为了伟大的和平事业，无论什么地方需要从事斗争和牺牲，匈牙利劳动人民就一定到那里去。”
