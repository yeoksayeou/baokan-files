    Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau Should Not Disperse Design Forces
    Technician Li Puqing of the Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau wrote a letter exposing the serious departmentalism of leading cadres in the Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau and the unreasonable dispersal of design forces. The following is a summary of the original letter:

    On February 10, 1952, at the beginning of the establishment of the Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau, 89 technical personnel were concentrated to form two design teams to carry out the design work of key projects in 1953. Recently, the bureau decided to disperse these already concentrated design personnel to various factories and also planned to transfer 39 design personnel to production. The bureau chief said: This is to make the design work "more closely integrated with the site and reality, and lay a good foundation for construction."

    I think that dispersing design forces in this way is wrong, whether from the perspective of completing this year's design tasks or from the long-term plan of training design personnel. Because now the total number of design personnel concentrated in various factories (excluding those in the divisions) is only 147, which can only basically complete this year's tasks. If the design personnel are dispersed to various factories to participate in production, there is no certainty that this year's tasks will be completed. At present, because various factories control the design forces, the design division can only stare blankly at the tasks. Recently, we borrowed two tracers from the Second Factory, but the factory director said no, and asked the personnel division to issue a document. Therefore, the work within the division cannot be carried out, and only some piecemeal work can be done.

    Why is the Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau doing this? This is mainly because the leading cadres have departmentalism. Several bureau chiefs are very good in other aspects, but they cannot understand this issue, and they have concerns in their minds. They are afraid that the central government will not pay attention to the synthetic petroleum industry and believe that it is necessary to retain some forces. In February of this year, the director of the General Bureau asked several bureau chiefs of our bureau whether it was possible to concentrate the design personnel within the scope of the Northeast. The bureau chiefs of our bureau unanimously believed that it was not feasible. Comrade Chu Zhiyuan, the second deputy bureau chief (responsible for capital construction and design work), regarded the design personnel of the Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau system as his little family property. He had long opposed concentrating the design personnel to the central government. When he went to the General Bureau in Beijing last October, the comrade of the design division who went with him handed over the list of design personnel of the Northeast Petroleum system to the General Bureau. He flew into a rage and said: "Aren't we exposing all our cards!" Recently, the General Bureau issued an order requiring the design personnel of the Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau system to be concentrated in Beijing before April 30. After the order from the General Bureau arrived, the bureau still did not change its original decision. After receiving the order, Deputy Bureau Chief Chu asked Director Yang of the design division to organize a discussion, but he did not express his opinion. At the meeting, Director Yang said that he was in favor of concentration, but he had concerns about concentrating in the central government. He also said that the three bureau chiefs believed that the design personnel of the Northeast Petroleum Administration Bureau should be dispersed in various factories so that they could be "better trained."

    I think this issue is serious and should be corrected quickly.

### 东北石油管理局不该分散设计力量

    东北石油管理局不该分散设计力量
    东北石油管理局技术员李普庆来信揭发东北石油管理局领导干部本位主义思想严重，不合理地分散设计力量。现将原信摘要发表于下：
    一九五二年二月十日，东北石油管理局成立之初，曾集中了八十九名技术人员，组织了两个设计组，进行一九五三年重点工程的设计工作。最近，局里又决定把这些已经集中的设计人员分散到各厂去，同时还准备把三十九名设计人员转到生产方面去。局长说：这样做是为使设计工作“更密切结合现场，结合实际，给施工打下良好基础。”
    我认为这样分散设计力量的作法，无论是从完成今年设计任务来看，或是从培养设计人员的长远打算看，都是错误的。因为现在把各厂设计人员全部集中（不包括处内人员），才有一百四十七人，只能基本上完成今年任务。如果把设计人员分散到各厂去参加生产，那完成今年任务是一点把握都没有的。目前因为各厂把持设计力量，所以设计处是看着任务干瞪眼，最近我们向二厂借用两个描图工，该厂厂长说不给，要人事处来文。因此，处内工作展不开，只找些零星工作做。
    东北石油管理局为什么这样作呢？这主要是领导干部存在着本位主义思想。几个局长在别的方面都很好，只是对这个问题想不通，思想上有顾虑，怕中央不重视人造石油工业，认为有必要保留一部分力量。今年二月总局局长曾问我局几位局长是否可将设计人员在东北范围内集中。我局几位局长一致认为不行。第二副局长褚志远同志（负责基本建设与设计工作），把东北石油管理局系统的设计人员看成他的小家底，他很早以前就反对把设计人员集中到中央去。去年十月他去北京总局时，随去的设计处同志把东北石油系统设计人员名单交给了总局，他大发脾气说：“岂不把底都露了吗！”最近，总局来命令，要东北石油管理局系统设计人员在四月三十日前集中到北京。总局的命令来到后，局里仍然没有改变原来的决定。褚副局长接到命令后，让设计处杨处长组织讨论，自己未提出意见。会上，杨处长说：他是赞成集中的，但集中到中央去则有顾虑。同时还说三位局长都认为东北石油管理局的设计人员应分散在各厂，只有这样才能“更好地培养他们”。
    我认为这一问题是严重的，应该迅速纠正。
