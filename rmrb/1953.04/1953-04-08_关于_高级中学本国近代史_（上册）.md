    Regarding "Advanced Middle School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1)
    Qi Xia
    The "Advanced Middle School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1) edited by Song Yunbin has many problems, the most important of which is the lack of specific analysis of specific situations.

    The theme of modern Chinese history is "the process of imperialism and Chinese feudalism combining to turn China into a semi-colony and colony, which is also the process of the Chinese people resisting imperialism and its running dogs." Therefore, compiling modern Chinese history must focus on this theme, and provide a systematic, profound, and essential explanation of each important event, so that students can have a clear understanding of this rich and struggle-filled history, thereby recognizing the development and direction of the Chinese revolution.

    Although Song Yunbin's "Advanced Middle School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1) presents the theme of the past century, it fails to highlight it prominently. Taking the section "The Great Combination of Anti-Manchu Forces" in the chapter "The Revolution of 1911" in this book as an example, a full explanation can be obtained.

    The theme of this section is to explain the situation of the revolutionaries during the Revolution of 1911. It should point out the class power, political propositions, and characteristics of the main leaders of the revolutionaries, and under what circumstances the various factions converged into a revolutionary torrent. However, the editor did not explain the theme around this key point: First, regarding Sun Yat-sen, the most important leader of this revolution, the editor only made a comparison with Kang Youwei that was neither sharp nor correct, saying that the two "shared the great ambition of saving the country," but did not talk about his political thought; Second, Zhang Binglin's name, origin, and whether he had "fame" were all mentioned, and he was also compared with Kang Youwei,... but Zhang Binglin's political propositions during this period were not discussed much; Third, the oath-taking ceremony and the number of meetings of the Tongmenghui were all discussed, but the circumstances under which the factions with different propositions united were not discussed. Therefore, according to the textbook's narration, we cannot see that Sun Yat-sen and others represent the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, nor can we see the contradictions between the revolutionary factions and the size of the revolutionary forces. Therefore, we also feel that the conclusion of this chapter, stating that the Tongmenghui itself was a contradictory organization and that the Revolution of 1911 was a bourgeois revolution, etc., lacks practical content.

    From this, it can be seen that this textbook is: accumulating materials, listing phenomena; unclear key points; unclear themes.

    From this, it can be seen that the basic problem with this textbook lies in the lack of "the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism: specifically analyzing specific situations."

    In terms of the characters presented in the textbook: due to the lack of class content, the activities of these characters become isolated individual activities, and it is impossible to see that they are carrying out activities on behalf of what class or group; due to the lack of analysis, the role of these characters cannot be correctly estimated. For example, regarding Lin Zexu, he is only called "a pioneer and radical in the anti-smoking movement," without pointing out that he was a representative of a few progressive elements in the landlord class, a patriot who united the people and resolutely resisted the British robbers; regarding Emperor Daoguang, it only says "Emperor Daoguang was greatly angered, and his attitude became tougher," without indicating that he was such a representative figure, a figure representing the corrupt feudal landlord class that occupied the ruling position, suppressing domestically and compromising and surrendering externally.

    Under these circumstances, the textbook cannot explain the changes in various classes and groups in the process of many important historical events, thereby clarifying the characteristics and distinctions of various classes and groups.

    For example, in the "Westernization Movement," the textbook does not point out this major change: in the Westernization Movement, warlords and bureaucrats representing the reactionary landlord class, in order to strengthen their feudal rule and feudal separatism, adopted new machines and opened factories, subjectively attempting to prevent the development of capitalism in China, but objectively unable to prevent the emergence of the most revolutionary and promising proletariat.

    For example, regarding the Hundred Days' Reform, it did not point out that it was the high tide of the reformist movement, nor did it correctly point out the class attributes of the sponsors of the reform movement. As early as one or two decades before the Sino-Japanese War, reformist ideas had been brewing among the upper-level scholar-officials. After the Sino-Japanese War, due to the stimulation of the war's failure, this idea became more and more developed. Kang Youwei summarized this idea and made it further developed, thus setting off the high tide of the Reform Movement. The textbook does not point out the previous course of the Hundred Days' Reform, so this movement becomes a sudden movement lacking historical roots. Without seeing this historical root, one cannot accurately point out that the Hundred Days' Reform was sponsored by a part of the landlord class transformed into the bourgeoisie.

    For example, regarding the constitutionalists such as Kang Youwei and the revolutionaries represented by Sun Yat-sen, there is no sharp and correct distinction. Due to the class characteristics of Kang Youwei and others, they have a capitalist side, but also a considerable feudal color. After the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform, they still stubbornly adhere to their original political propositions and oppose the revolutionary faction headed by Sun Yat-sen, whose purpose is to overthrow the Qing feudal rule and establish a republic. Therefore, Kang Youwei's group, which was regarded as a progressive force during the Hundred Days' Reform, should be referred to as a backward, reactionary political group that hinders the development of revolutionary forces in the period after the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform. The textbook not only does not make such an explanation, but also compares Kang Youwei and Sun Yat-sen in this way, saying that they "shared the great ambition of saving the country," not knowing that the country (national power) that Kang Youwei wanted to save was exactly what Sun Yat-sen wanted to overthrow; and the mission given to people by history was to overthrow the Qing feudal regime. This mistake in the textbook is extremely serious.

    In short, because the editors lack specific analysis of specific situations, this textbook does not clearly show the historical waves and profound and drastic historical changes, and becomes an accumulation of many trivial materials and a list of phenomena without internal connections. It is obvious that this textbook is far from being able to "enable students to recognize the historical direction of Marxism" and is far from meeting the needs of current teaching. It is hoped that the relevant publishing agencies will pay close attention to this issue.

    关于“高级中学本国近代史”（上册）
    漆侠
    宋云彬编著的“高级中学本国近代史”（上册），是存在着很多问题的，而最主要的问题则在于：对于具体的情况缺乏具体的分析。
    中国近代史的主题，乃是“帝国主义和中国封建主义相结合，把中国变为半殖民地和殖民地的过程，也就是中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程”。因此，编写中国近代史就必须抓紧这个主题，把其中每个重要事件，给以系统的深刻的本质的说明，才能使学生对于这富于内容的和充满了斗争的历史，有一个明确的概念，从而体认到中国革命的发展和方向。
    宋云彬的“高级中学本国近代史”（上册），虽然把近百年史的主题提示出来，但却没有能够将其突出显现。试以本书“辛亥革命”章中的“反满势力大结合”一节为例，就可得到充分的说明。
    这节的主题在于说明辛亥革命时期革命派的情况，应当指出革命派的阶级力量、政治主张、主要领导者的特点，以及在何种情况下，各个不同的派别汇成一个革命巨流。可是编者却没有围绕着这个重点来说明主题：一、对这次革命的最主要的领导者孙中山，编者只把他和康有为做了一个既不尖锐又不正确的对比，竟说两人“同抱救国宏愿”，而对他的政治思想却没有谈到；二、把章炳麟的姓名、籍贯、有没有“功名”都谈到了，也把他和康有为做了对比，……但对章炳麟这一时期的政治主张却没有多谈；三、把同盟会的入盟仪式、开会的次数都谈过了，但对于主张有所不同的各派别是在什么情况下结合起来，却没有谈到。因此，根据课本的叙述，我们看不出孙中山等代表着资产阶级、小资产阶级，也看不出革命派别之间的矛盾和革命力量的大小。因此，我们也就觉得，这章的结论称同盟会本身是一个矛盾组织、辛亥革命是资产阶级革命等等，都是缺乏实际内容的。
    由此可见，这个课本是：堆积材料，罗列现象；重点不明；主题不清。
    由此可见，这个课本所存在的基本问题，在于缺乏“马克思主义的最本质的东西、马克思主义的活的灵魂：具体地分析具体的情况”。
    以课本上所表现的人物来说：由于缺乏阶级的内容，这些人物的活动，就成为孤零零的个人的活动，看不出他们是代表着什么阶级什么集团来进行活动；由于缺乏分析，对这些人物的作用也就不能够给以正确的估计。例如对林则徐，只称他是“禁烟运动中的一位先觉急进者”，没有指出他是地主阶级中少数进步分子的代表，是结合人民群众、坚决抵抗英国强盗的爱国主义者；对道光帝，只说“道光帝大为震怒，态度又强硬起来”，并没表明他是这样一个代表人物，是代表着占有统治地位的腐朽的封建地主阶级、对内进行镇压、对外妥协投降的一个人物。
    在这种情况下，课本也就不能够在许多重要历史事件的进程中，说明社会各阶级各集团的变化，从而阐明各阶级各集团的特性及其区分。
    例如在“洋务运动”中，课本竟没有指出这一重大变化：在洋务运动中，代表着反动地主阶级的军阀和官僚，为加强其封建统治和封建割据，采用新式机器，开设工厂，主观上企图阻遏资本主义在中国的发展，客观上却无法阻遏革命性最彻底的最有前途的无产阶级的产生。
    例如对于戊戌变法，没有指出它是改良主义运动的高潮，也没有正确指出变法运动的主持者的阶级属性。早在甲午战争之前的一二十年间，上层士大夫间已经酝酿着改良主义的思想，到甲午战争之后，由于战争失败的刺激，这种思想就愈加发展。康有为总结了这种思想，并使之做更进一步的发展，遂掀起维新运动的高潮。课本没有指出戊戌变法的前此历程，因此这个运动就成为突如其来的、缺乏历史根源的运动了。没有看出这种历史根源，也就不能确指戊戌变法乃是由一部分地主转化过来的资产阶级主持的。
    例如对康有为等立宪派和以孙中山为代表的革命派，就没有尖锐的正确的区分。由于康有为等所具有的阶级特性，有其资本主义的一面，也有其相当浓厚的封建主义的色彩，在戊戌变法失败之后，仍然固执原有的政治主张，反对以孙中山为首的以推翻满清封建统治、建立共和国为宗旨的革命派；因此在戊戌变法时期被视为进步力量的康有为集团，到戊戌变法失败之后的时期里，就应当指为落后的、反动的、阻碍革命势力发展的政治集团了。课本不仅没有作这样的说明，而且把康有为和孙中山这样来对比，竟说他们“同抱救国宏愿”，不知道康有为所要救的国（国家政权）正是孙中山所要推倒的；而历史赋予人们的使命，正是要推倒满清封建政权。课本的这种错误，是极其严重的。
    总之，由于编者对于具体情况缺乏具体分析，这个课本就没有清楚地表现出历史波浪和深刻而剧烈的历史变化，而成为许多琐碎材料的堆积和没有内在联系的现象的罗列了。显然可见，这个课本是远远不能“使学生对历史走向马克思主义的认识”的，是远远不能满足当前教学中的需要的，深望有关出版机关密切注意这个问题。
