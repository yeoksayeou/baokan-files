    Xinhua Bookstore Has Published a Large Number of Books to Cooperate with the Publicity and Implementation of the Marriage Law Movement
    Letter from the General Store of Xinhua Bookstore: The suggestion made by the reader Lin E’sheng published in the People's Daily on strengthening the distribution of popular books and pictures publicizing the Marriage Law is correct. According to the instructions of the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government, the Xinhua Bookstore General Store began preparations for the distribution of books to cooperate with the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law movement in late December last year, and listed this as the central task for the first quarter of this year. After conducting investigations among the masses and contacting local party committees, offices for implementing the Marriage Law, democratic women's federations, and local publishing administrative agencies, we decided to plan to distribute 12.6 million books (including picture albums and pictures, excluding magazines) nationwide to cooperate with the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law. Among them, five types of books are planned to be distributed as a priority, totaling 8.5 million copies, of which more than 94 percent are popular reading materials for workers, peasants, and general grassroots cadres of workers and peasants. At present, most of the books, picture albums, etc. related to the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law in various places have been published and distributed to various places. A small number of books have not been fully distributed due to the late publication time.

    新华书店已出版大量配合宣传贯彻婚姻法运动的书籍
    新华书店总店来信：人民日报上发表的读者林蕚生对加强宣传婚姻法的通俗书刊、图画的发行工作的建议是正确的。新华书店总店根据中央人民政府出版总署的指示，从去年十二月下旬即已对配合宣传贯彻婚姻法运动进行了书籍发行的准备工作，并将此列为今年第一季度的中心工作。我们在群众中进行了调查并和各地党委、贯彻婚姻法办公室、民主妇联及地方出版行政机关等联系后，决定在全国计划发行配合宣传贯彻婚姻法的书籍（包括画册、图片，杂志除外）一千二百六十万册。其中作为重点发行的书籍计五种八五○万册，百分之九十四以上为工农群众及一般工农基层干部的通俗读物。目前各地有关宣传贯彻婚姻法的书籍、画册等大部分均已出版并分发到各地。还有少数书籍因出版时间较迟，未能全部发出。
