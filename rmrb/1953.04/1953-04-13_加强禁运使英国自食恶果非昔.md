Following the Anglo-American talks in Washington, Eden himself and some of the British bourgeois newspapers boasted about the so-called "cooperation" between Britain and the United States. This self-deceiving argument is quite astonishing. Eden and Butler took a series of begging-style proposals to Washington—in Butler's words, things like "generous grants and open trade"—none of which received "cooperation" from the United States. Only a robber-like transaction outside the topic of the talks was "agreed" upon, namely, Britain would succumb to the American policy of strengthening the embargo against China in exchange for American support for it to extort "compensation" from Iran for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. However, even this so-called "support" is just the United States attempting to force Iran to give Britain "compensation," and then the United States will seize Iranian oil from Britain's hands.

Not only that, the British government's strengthening of embargo measures against China, whether it is, as the *Manchester Guardian* said, "perhaps a substitute for the naval blockade of China that Washington casually talked about," or, as the *Economist* magazine said, a "compromise," is always another shameful act by the British government of being hostile to the Chinese people, succumbing to American plunder policies, and war policies. This action cannot harm China, but only strengthens the plunder of the British Empire by American "friends," causing Britain to suffer even greater damage. Because Britain should have already learned enough lessons from the damage it suffered from participating in the embargo against China for almost two years.

First, the British cannot fail to recall the traditional interests of trade with China. Sino-British trade relations have a history of more than 270 years, and the highest period of import and export volume between the two countries reached 200 million U.S. dollars per year. After October 1949, there was once a great recovery and development, but as a result of the British government's participation in the American embargo against China, Sino-British trade has now decreased by more than 90 percent in quantity. As for Hong Kong's trade with mainland China, according to statistics published by the Hong Kong government, the total value of Hong Kong's import and export trade with mainland China in 1952 decreased by 45.1 percent compared with 1951. Among them, the value of goods imported from mainland China in 1952 was 830,220,000 Hong Kong dollars, a decrease of only 3.8 percent; but the value of exported goods decreased by more than 1.08 billion Hong Kong dollars, a huge decrease of 67.5 percent. This is as the British *Economist* loudly exclaimed: "In 1952, one-fifth of Hong Kong's total trade of more than one billion U.S. dollars was with China," but due to "silently enduring" the "great difficulties suffered" by participating in the embargo against China, "Hong Kong lost about 70 percent of its exports to China in 1952, worth about 200 million U.S. dollars." Therefore, even Eden himself had to sadly say to the American master after the Washington talks: "Due to the embargo of strategic materials to China, Hong Kong has lost its role in the normal economy. I believe you (referring to the American master) also recognize the fact that Hong Kong must survive." Butler also said helplessly: "It would be dishonest to say that Britain's trade with communist countries is unimportant."

At the same time, the British see very clearly that the United States is forcing the British government not to allow British ships to carry so-called strategic materials to mainland China, and trying not to give any country's ships carrying such materials coal in British ports. This will also please the United States in its calculations to strike at the shipping of Britain and other capitalist countries. People know that before the Second World War, the British shipping industry dominated the world, but in recent years it has fallen far behind the United States. The embargo forcibly implemented by the United States further hit the British shipping industry. Taking the Hong Kong shipping industry as an example, with the decline of Hong Kong's trade with mainland China, the total tonnage of import and export cargo transported by sea and river vessels throughout 1952 decreased by another 10.1 percent compared with 1951, of which the tonnage of export cargo decreased by 20 percent. Anderson, chairman of the United Kingdom Shipping Association, had already loudly exclaimed on February 27 that the British shipping industry was shrinking due to being hit. He said: "The tonnage of British tramp freighters was 3.5 million tons in 1939, reduced to 3.1 million tons in 1950, and further reduced to 2.4 million tons in 1952." The *Times* also called for "the decline of tramp freighter shipping must be stopped, and the maintenance of the entire British shipping industry must be ensured."

An American senator, Alexander Smith, who is known as "influential in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee," hypocritically said: "In order to compensate for Britain's reduction of trade with communist China, we can adjust tariff rates and relax customs restrictions so that British goods can be sold more easily in the American market." (United Press) However, even this Smith, who seems to have a good heart, could not hide the crocodile tears he was shedding, and he hurriedly declared that he was "still in the research stage" and "cannot put it forward as a definite suggestion yet." In fact, Eden and Butler's rebuff in Washington this time was a test of this "goodwill" of the American "friend."

The facts of the past two years have thoroughly exposed that the notorious American blockade and embargo policy has become a useful weapon for American monopoly capitalists to expand. It has facilitated the United States to intensify its control and plunder of Asian and Far Eastern countries, and to squeeze out its competitors, especially Britain's traditional forces in this region. Therefore, this policy has made the struggle between British and American imperialism for the source of raw materials and sales markets in Asia and the Far East even more acute.

People know that the vast colonies and spheres of influence possessed by Britain are the largest producers of many important industrial raw materials. For example, in Southeast Asia, natural rubber production accounts for more than 90 percent of the world's total production, and tin accounts for more than 60 percent of the world's total production. Among them, jute produced in Pakistan accounts for 60 percent of the world's production. Manganese produced in India accounts for 30 percent of the world's production, and mica accounts for about 75 percent. And all these important raw materials happen to be the major commodities that the United States needs to import every year. After the Second World War, although American monopoly capital extensively invaded Southeast Asian countries, British monopoly capitalists still maintained a dominant position in these raw material markets. Since 1950, the United States has massively purchased strategic raw materials and caused the price of these raw materials to rise, allowing the British Empire to earn a large amount of U.S. dollar foreign exchange. For example, in 1951, the income from the sale of rubber, tin, wool, jute, cocoa, and other products by the United Kingdom was twice the output of British industrial products, of which the U.S. dollars earned from the sale of rubber alone were about equal to the total value of all British exports to the United States.

However, since 1951, especially after the United States forced countries to implement an embargo, the United States has used this weapon and the large amount of raw material stockpiles it has already acquired to give the sales of raw materials in many countries in Southeast Asia and the interests of the British Empire a heavy blow through the methods of price reduction, suspension of purchases, reduction of purchases, increased production of substitutes, and defeating them one by one, creating more favorable conditions for American monopoly capital to further control the Southeast Asian market. For example, after the United States stored tin in 1951, it began not to be a buyer of tin, but instead sold tin in the United Kingdom, causing the price of tin to fall from 1,620 pounds per ton in February to 850 pounds in August. The price of rubber in Malaya also fell from 2.4 Malayan dollars per pound in the second half of 1951 to 0.74 Malayan dollars per pound in July 1952. In this way, the United States made a fortune. The Tin Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate admitted on July 16, 1952, that the United States had earned 500 million U.S. dollars in profit just from lowering the price of tin; while for the British Empire, it meant that the U.S. dollar income from the sale of these raw materials had suffered a great loss.

Moreover, this situation is greatly conducive to the large-scale offensive of American commodity sales markets in Southeast Asian countries. After the United States reduced the number of orders for rubber, tin, and other raw materials in Southeast Asia, its exports to Southeast Asia greatly increased, resulting in a large amount of trade deficits and a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves in many countries in Southeast Asia, making it more favorable for the United States to strengthen its monopoly position in the markets of these countries and forcefully strike at British forces in this traditional British market. For example, in India—a country that has always been one of the largest markets for British goods—the proportion of American goods in India's total imports has increased from 7.3 percent in 1938 to 33.47 percent in 1951; while the United Kingdom has decreased from 30.6 percent to 18.4 percent in the same period. In Malaya, a colony directly ruled by the United Kingdom, the number of commodities imported from the United States has also increased rapidly by a larger multiple than that of the United Kingdom. In Indonesia and Thailand, American export trade is increasingly gaining the upper hand over Britain; especially in Thailand, various major industrial raw materials in Thailand such as rubber, tin, and tungsten have been monopolized by American companies, and Britain has in fact been driven out of Thailand's economic sphere. It is estimated that from 1937 to 1951, the United States' exports to Southeast Asia and Australia increased by 360 percent, while the United Kingdom only increased by 260 percent; however, in 1951, the United Kingdom's exports to Southeast Asia and Australia still far exceeded those of the United States, and the share of these countries in the United States' exports remained at the 1937 level in 1951, while the share of these countries in the United Kingdom's exports increased by nearly half during the same period.

At the same time, after the United States forced Japan to participate in the embargo against China, Japan was unable to restore its favorable trade with China, and also expanded into Southeast Asia and other British Empire markets, making British trade face competition from this powerful rival again. For example, in 1951-52, although the total value of Japan's export trade has sharply declined, its exports to India have increased by 2.4 times, and it has replaced the United Kingdom as the main supplier of textiles to Pakistan. *U.S. News & World Report* said: "Japan has not only seized part of the British Asian market, but has also invaded the sterling area—the traditional British region—to a considerable extent."

Finally, it must also be pointed out that Britain's strengthening of the embargo against China and North Korea is part of its succumbing to the American policy of restricting the entire East-West trade. People know that Britain's past restrictions on favorable trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have caused it to suffer increasingly serious invasions by American capital into the British mainland and the British Empire market, resulting in a worsening dollar shortage and the increasing disintegration of the British Empire market; therefore, any measures taken by the British government to strengthen the embargo will only make its foreign trade situation worse and suffer greater blows from American capital. For example, although Britain adopted a large number of measures to reduce imports and vigorously implement "starvation exports" and other measures to resist the invasion of American capital last year, the overall foreign trade situation continued to deteriorate, and the trade deficit for the whole year still reached 788 million pounds. Since the beginning of this year, the British foreign trade crisis has continued to deepen. Therefore, more and more British industrialists and businessmen cannot but see more and more clearly that strengthening the so-called embargo is contrary to the interests of the British Empire, and the current policy of restricting East-West trade cannot continue. The report published by the British International Trade Promotion Committee at the end of February criticized the British government for being "too enthusiastic" about the so-called embargo, pointing out that this is "both unreasonable and harmful to Britain." Therefore, the opposition of the two world markets, and the result of the United States and Britain strengthening the implementation of the embargo will inevitably further shrink the capitalist world market, deepen the periodic crisis of capitalism, and make the backward countries in Asia and other regions suffer more cruel plunder and enslavement. This will not only arouse the opposition of countries in Asia and other regions to the American and British embargo policy, but will inevitably make the contradictions between American and British imperialism, and the contradictions between imperialism and colonies and dependencies more profound and intense. It is unbelievable to think that Britain will endure the constraints and blows of the American embargo and restrictions on East-West trade for a long time.

### 加强禁运使英国自食恶果非昔

    加强禁运使英国自食恶果非昔
    英美华盛顿会谈后，艾登本人和英国的一些资产阶级报刊，吹嘘了一番所谓英美的“合作”。这种自欺欺人的论调，是十分叫人吃惊的。艾登和巴特勒带到华盛顿去的一连串乞求式的建议——拿巴特勒的话说就是“慷慨的赠款援助和开放贸易”之类，没有任何一点得到了美国的“合作”。只有会谈主题以外的一件强盗交易，倒是“协议”了的，即英国以屈从美国加强对中国禁运的政策，来换取美国支持它向伊朗勒索一笔英伊石油公司的“赔偿”。但是，就是这个所谓“支持”，也不过是美国企图强迫伊朗给英国一笔“赔偿”，然后由美国把伊朗石油从英国手里抢夺过来。
    不仅这样。英国政府加强对中国的禁运措施，不管是像“曼彻斯特卫报”所说“可能算是华盛顿曾随意谈论的海军封锁中国措施的一种代替办法”，还是像“经济学者”杂志所说的“折衷办法”，这总是英国政府又一次敌视中国人民、屈从美国掠夺政策和战争政策的可耻行为。这种行为，损害不了中国，而只是加强了美国“朋友”对英帝国的劫夺，使英国自己遭受到更大的损害。因为，英国从过去差不多两年参加对中国禁运所受到的损害中，就已不难领取足够的教训了。
    首先，英国人不能不联想到与中国贸易的传统利益。中英贸易关系已有二百七十余年的历史，两国输出入额最高时期曾年达两亿美元。一九四九年十月以后，曾一度有很大的恢复和发展，但由于英国政府参加美国对中国禁运的结果，到现在中英贸易在数量上已减少了百分之九十以上。至于香港对中国大陆的贸易，据香港政府发表的统计，一九五二年香港对中国大陆的进出口贸易总值比一九五一年减少了百分之四十五点一，其中一九五二年从中国大陆进口货值为八三、○二二万港元，仅减少了百分之三点八；但出口货值却减少了十亿八千多万港元，即减少了百分之六十七点五之巨。这正如英国“经济学者”所大声疾呼的：“在一九五二年，香港十亿多美元的贸易总额中，五分之一是与中国进行的贸易”，但由于“默默地忍受了”参加对中国禁运所“遭受的极大困难”，“香港在一九五二年中损失了对中国的输出贸易百分之七十，共值约两亿美元。”因此，连艾登本人在华盛顿会谈结束后，也不得不悲哀地对着美国主人说：“由于禁运战略物资给中国，香港已消失了它在正常经济上的作用。我相信你们（指美国主人）也承认这一事实，即香港必须生存下去”。巴特勒也无可奈何地说：“如果说英国和共产党国家的贸易无关轻重，那是不老实的。”
    同时，英国人看得很清楚：美国强迫英国政府不让英国船只载运所谓战略物资到中国大陆，并设法不给任何国家载运这种物资的船只在英国港口加煤，这也将使美国在打击英国及其他资本主义国家航运的盘算上，感到称心。人们知道，在第二次世界大战前英国航运业是称雄于世界的，但近年来已远远落在美国的后面了。美国强迫英国实行的禁运，又进一步打击了英国的航运业。就以香港航运业而论，随着香港对中国大陆贸易的衰退，一九五二年全年经由海洋和内河轮船载运进出口货运总吨数，较一九五一年再度减少了百分之十点一，其中出口货运吨数减少了百分之二十。联合王国航运会主席安德生，在二月二十七日就已大声疾呼英国航运业因遭受打击而日益萎缩。他说：“英国不定期货船的吨数在一九三九年为三百五十万吨，在一九五○年减为三百一十万吨，在一九五二年更减为二百四十万吨。”“泰晤士报”也因此呼吁“必须制止这种不定期货船航运的衰萎现象，并保证维持整个的英国航运业”。
    美国有一位被称为“参院外交委员会里有势力”的参议员亚历山大·史密斯，假惺惺地说：“为了作为英国削减与共产党中国的贸易的补偿，我们可以调整关税率，放宽海关限制，以便使英国货能更容易在美国市场上销售。”（合众社）但是，就是这个看来是好心肠的史密斯自己，也不能掩饰他是流的鳄鱼眼泪，他接着就赶忙申明他“还在研究阶段”，“现在还不能把它作为一个肯定的建议提出来”。其实，艾登和巴特勒这次在华盛顿碰了一鼻子灰，正是美国“朋友”这种“善意”的一次测验。
    过去两年来的事实已彻底暴露了臭名远扬的美国封锁禁运政策，已经成了美国垄断资本家进行扩张的有用武器，它便利了美国加紧对亚洲和远东各国的控制和掠夺，并排挤它的竞争者特别是英国在这一地区的传统势力。因此，这个政策，也就使得英美帝国主义争夺亚洲和远东的原料来源和销售市场的斗争，更加尖锐起来。
    人们知道，英国所拥有的广大殖民地和势力范围，是许多种重要工业原料的最大出产地。如在东南亚，天然橡胶产量就占世界总产量的百分之九十以上，锡占世界总产量的百分之六十以上。其中巴基斯坦出产的黄麻占世界产量的百分之六十。印度所产的锰占世界产量的百分之三十，云母约占百分之七十五。而所有这些重要原料，又恰恰是美国每年需要输入的大宗。第二次世界大战后，美国垄断资本虽然大举侵入了东南亚各国，但英国垄断资本家仍在这些原料市场上保持着支配的地位。一九五○年起，美国大量搜购战略原料，并造成这些原料价格的上涨，使英帝国赚取了一大笔的美元外汇。如一九五一年英国出售橡胶、锡、羊毛、黄麻、可可等产品的所得，为英国工业品输出的两倍，其中单靠出售橡胶一项所得的美元，就约等于英国对美国全部出口的总值。
    但是，自从一九五一年起，特别是美国强制各国实行禁运后，美国就利用这个武器和它已经获得的大量原料囤积，以压价、停购、减购、增产代用品和各个击破的手法，给了东南亚许多国家的原料销售和英帝国的利益以惨重的打击，为美国垄断资本进一步控制东南亚市场创造了更有利的条件。比如一九五一年美国储存了锡以后，就开始不再为锡的买主，而却在英国本部出售锡了，使得锡价由二月的每吨一、六二○英镑，跌到八月的八五○英镑。马来亚的橡胶价格，也从一九五一年下半年的每磅二元四角叻币，跌落到一九五二年七月的每磅七角四分叻币。这样，就使美国大发横财。一九五二年七月十六日美国参议院的锡小组委员会承认，美国单是压低锡价的结果，就挣来了五亿美元的利润；而对英帝国来说，那却是意味着在出售这些原料时的美元收入，受到了极大的损失。
    并且，这种情况大大有利于美国对东南亚国家商品销售市场的大举进攻。美国减少在东南亚定购橡胶、锡和其他原料的数量后，对东南亚的输出却大为增加，造成了东南亚许多国家的大量入超和外汇储备激减的现象，使美国更有利地加强在这些国家市场的垄断地位，并有力地在这个英国传统市场里打击英国的势力。如在印度——这个一贯是英国商品的最大市场之一的国家，美国商品在印度总输入额中的比重已从一九三八年的百分之七点三增加到一九五一年的百分之三十三点四七；而英国在同时期却从百分之三十点六降到百分之十八点四。在英国直接统治下的殖民地马来亚，美国输入的商品也以比英国更大的倍数迅速增加着。在印尼和泰国，美国的输出贸易更是日益占居英国的上风；特别是在泰国，泰国的各种主要工业原料如橡胶、锡和钨等已被美国公司所垄断，英国事实上已被赶出了泰国的经济范围。据估计，从一九三七年至一九五一年这一时期内，美国对东南亚和澳洲各国的输出，先后增加了百分之三百六十，而英国只增加了二百六十；不过，一九五一年英国对东南亚和澳洲各国的输出，仍远超过美国，东南亚和澳洲各国在美国输出额中所占的份额，一九五一年仍停留在一九三七年的水平上，而这些国家在英国输出额中的份额，同期内却增大了几近一半。
    同时，美国强迫日本参加对中国禁运后，日本不能恢复与中国的有利贸易，也向东南亚及其他英帝国市场进行扩张，使英国贸易重新受到这个有力的劲敌的竞争。如一九五一——五二年，日本的输出贸易总值虽已锐落，但对印度的输出却增加了二点四倍，并代替英国而成为巴基斯坦的织物主要供应者。“美国新闻与世界报道”说：“日本不仅夺取了英国亚洲市场的一部分，并且在相当程度上侵入了英镑区——传统上的英国地区。”
    最后，还必须指出，英国加强对中朝两国的禁运，是它屈从美国限制整个东西方贸易的政策的一部分。人们知道，英国过去限制和苏联及各人民民主国家的有利贸易，已使它遭受了美国资本对英国本部和英帝国市场的日益严重的侵袭，弄得美元慌有加无已，英帝国市场日益瓦解；因此，英国政府任何加强禁运的措施，都只有使它的对外贸易状况更加恶化，受到美国资本更大的打击。例如，去年英国虽然采取了大量削减入口并大力实行“饥饿输出”以及其他抵制美国资本侵袭的措施，但整个对外贸易情况仍继续恶化，全年进出口逆差仍达七亿八千八百万镑。今年开年以后，英国对外贸易危机仍有进一步加深的趋势。因此，英国工商业家中已有更多的人不能不日益清醒地看到，加强所谓禁运是违反英帝国的利益的，目前的限制东西方贸易的政策，不能继续下去了。英国国际贸易促进委员会在二月底发表的报告，就批评英国政府“过于热心”于所谓禁运，指出这是“既不合理，又是有害于英国的”。因此，两个世界市场的对立，美英加强实行禁运的结果，势必更加缩小了资本主义世界市场，加深资本主义的周期危机，并使亚洲及其他地区的落后国家受到更加残酷的掠夺和奴役，这除了引起亚洲及其他地区国家对美英禁运政策的反对外，不可避免地要使美英帝国主义之间的矛盾、和帝国主义与殖民地和附属国之间的矛盾更趋深刻化和剧烈化。如果认为英国会长此忍受美国禁运和限制东西方贸易政策的束缚和打击，那是不可相信的。
