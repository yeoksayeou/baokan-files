The Working People in Capitalist Countries Face Increasing Hardship
Prices Rise and Living Standards Fall in the United States, Britain, Japan and Other Countries

    **Living Expenses of American Workers Continue to Rise**
    The Soviet "Pravda" published an article on the 9th by its New York correspondent, Litoshenko, commenting on the continuous rise in living expenses in the United States.
    He said that American workers have lost tens of billions of dollars due to rising prices since the war.
    The endless increase in food prices has severely impacted the economic situation of American worker families. Compared to the pre-war period, the food price index increased by 2.3 times by the end of last year. Prices for meat, milk, vegetables, fruits, and other foods have risen particularly sharply.
    Litoshenko further pointed out that even according to official figures, per capita consumption of major foods in early 1952 was significantly lower than in 1946. For example, butter decreased by 7.6 percent, meat by 10 percent, fresh fruits by 13.9 percent, flour by 14.7 percent, and coffee by 17.6 percent. People cannot afford nutritious food and are replacing it with food of lower nutritional value.
    Litoshenko said that it should be pointed out that although consumption in the United States is decreasing, this does not affect the profits of the monopoly capitalists who do food business and open chain stores. On the contrary, their profits are constantly increasing. Monopoly capitalists maintain high monopoly prices for food, thereby obtaining huge profits.
    The living standards of American workers are affected not only by the rising prices of food and general consumer goods. After the rent control laws are abolished on April 30, their living standards will be similarly severely hit. According to newspaper reports, this will mean a further increase of about 40 percent in rent for 30 million tenants.
    The New York State authorities recently decided to increase New York rents by 15 percent starting May 1, although rent already accounts for more than one-third of workers' income. But the plight of New York residents is not limited to these. Soon the subway fare will increase by 50 percent, and there are reports that the fare will increase by 100 to 200 percent. Municipal taxes levied on employees will also increase, and consumption taxes will also increase, and these taxes are mainly to be taken from the working people. New York workers estimate that these measures by the state and municipal authorities will squeeze another $150 from each worker this year.
    Ordinary American people are forced to buy on credit to cope with life. In 1953, consumer debt was more than eight times greater than in 1945.
    Litoshenko concluded by saying that the above facts illustrate how millions of American workers worry and struggle for a living every day.

    **The Living Standards of the Japanese People Are Getting Lower and Lower**
    The adverse effects of the policy of reviving Japanese militarism on the lives of the Japanese people are becoming increasingly apparent. Millions of Japanese workers are living in a difficult life where income does not cover expenditure.
    The cost of living is rising day by day. From the end of 1952, the prices of necessities and public utilities were the first to rise again. Rents rose by 56.4 percent, and rice rose by 9.7 percent. Freight rates on state-owned railways rose by 10 percent, passenger fares rose by 13.5 percent, and gas fees rose by 14.5 percent. According to official, scaled-down figures alone, Japanese retail prices in 1952 had already risen to more than 300 times the pre-war average level of 1934-1936. According to Kyodo News, the prices of consumer goods in Japan will continue to rise by 4 to 5 percent in 1953. The threat of exorbitant taxes and levies on the lives of the Japanese people is also increasing day by day. According to recently published figures from the Ministry of Finance, which have been reduced, the average tax burden per person in Japan in 1953 will be 20.4 percent of income, an increase of 7.6 percent compared to the pre-war period of 1934-1936.
    Under the influence of rising living costs and increased taxes, the real income of the working people is decreasing day by day, and their living standards are getting lower and lower. Their families are living a hard life with monthly expenditures exceeding income. In particular, the lives of semi-unemployed workers across the country are even more difficult. Taking the families of day laborers in Nagano Prefecture as an example, according to a survey of many day laborer families by the Nagano Branch of the All-Japan Civil Engineering and General Workers' Union, the average minimum living expenditure for a day laborer family with four or five members is 9,310 yen per month, but the actual average monthly wage income of a day laborer, including allowances, is only 5,610 yen. Out of such a small income, the cost of staple food and non-staple food alone is 5,480 yen per month, accounting for more than 97 percent of the total income.
    In order to make up for the lack of wages, many day laborers have to take on various odd jobs after a full day of heavy labor. Many families also have to rely on borrowing, selling things, and engaging in various side businesses, or even painfully selling their children, in order to temporarily maintain the lives of the whole family.

    **Living Conditions of the British People Deteriorate**
    As a result of the British government's pursuit of war policies, inflation has occurred, and the living conditions of the people have deteriorated.
    Military expenditure accounts for a large part of the British government's expenditure. In the 1952-1953 fiscal year, direct military expenditure exceeded 1.5 billion pounds, accounting for approximately 35 percent of total expenditure. If other indirect military expenditures and the amount of war debt repayments are added together, they total more than 2.1 billion pounds, approximately 22 percent of the national income in 1951. Huge military expenditures have created a huge fiscal deficit. In the 1952-1953 fiscal year, the deficit exceeded 400 million pounds.
    The British government has adopted measures to increase taxes and issue more banknotes. Since the end of World War II, British taxes have doubled, accounting for 34 percent of total national income. The amount of currency in circulation is currently nearly one-fifth higher than before the Korean War, and three times that before the war. As a result of the excessive issuance of banknotes, the purchasing power of the pound is constantly falling. Currently, one pound is only worth nine shillings before the war, a devaluation of more than half.
    Increased taxes, inflation, and reduced food subsidies have greatly stimulated the rise in prices. In 1952, the retail price index averaged 26 percent higher than the level of 1948. The actual price increase is far more dramatic than the official statistics. According to materials presented by Labor MP Lewis in the House of Commons in January, the prices of several major foods, such as flour, bread, butter, and meat, rose by 20 to 86 percent in 1952 alone. During this year, the cost of living in Britain rose by an average of 11 percent.
    Due to the high cost of living, workers' real wages have decreased by 20 percent compared to pre-war levels. More and more Britons complain that life is much worse than before the war. Britain's population has increased by nearly 6 percent compared to pre-war levels, but the total national consumption of butter last year decreased by nearly 52 percent compared to pre-war levels. Because a large amount of expenses has continued to be used to maintain a large army and expand armaments after the war, the lives of the British people have been restricted by the rationing system implemented during the war; moreover, with the continuous rise in prices and the large reduction in the import of essential civilian goods, the rationing amount is getting smaller and smaller. The "Tribune" biweekly said that in 1952, the weekly butter ration was two to three ounces, the lowest ration in the past five years. Even so, this year's ration is still decreasing. For example, the bacon ration was already very small, and it was reduced by another 20 percent from January 25. Currently, the volume of weekly meat ration is not much bigger than a matchbox. The high prices have made the so-called rationing nominal for many working families, and more and more families cannot afford even this meager ration. According to statistics from the "Daily Herald," in August last year, 1,848,000 people did not buy their meat ration, and by December, this number had increased to 2,318,000 people.
    The housing shortage, which has become a national disaster in Britain, is another direct consequence of the expansion of armaments. The British government has spent billions of pounds on expanding armaments, but the appropriations for building houses urgently needed by the people are negligible. According to official British figures, the amount spent on war preparations is equivalent to 22 times the amount spent on housing construction. It is estimated that there is currently a shortage of 6 million houses in the UK, and in London alone, there are more than 200,000 families in need of housing. In cities, tens of thousands of families have no houses to live in. The rise in rents caused by the housing shortage has further increased the burden on the lives of ordinary people.
    Another disaster befalling the British people is the increase in unemployment. In 1951 and 1952, unemployment continued to increase. Currently, there are nearly 500,000 fully unemployed workers in the UK, an increase of more than one-third compared to the end of 1950. In addition, there are at least the same number of partially unemployed workers. The living conditions of these unemployed workers are even worse.
    In order to seize more profits, British monopoly capitalists, disregarding the plight of the British people, have increased this year's direct military expenditure again from April 1 to 1,636,760,000 pounds, an increase of 8 percent compared to the 1952-1953 fiscal year. However, the repeatedly reduced food subsidies and social welfare expenses are still restricted to a very low level. Due to the continuous decline in the purchasing power of the pound, these expenses are actually further reduced.
    In the past year, the British working people have held thousands of meetings, strikes, protests and demonstrations in order to oppose the British government's policy of following the United States in expanding its arms race, and in order to fight for wage increases and improved living conditions.

    **Prices Soar in Latin American Countries, Making Life Unbearable**
    In Latin American countries, the real wages and purchasing power of the working people are constantly declining, while the prices of food and consumer goods are soaring.
    According to official materials, in Brazil, the food price index in 1952 reached 586.8 (with 1939 as 100). The "Economic and Financial Observer" pointed out that food prices in the Federal District rose by 30 percent in 1952, and in Sao Paulo by 27 percent.
    The "Morning Post" pointed out that the prices of essential necessities are rising rapidly. Not only is famine rampant in eastern Brazil and the drought-stricken northeastern states, but even in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, famines have occurred repeatedly.
    Rising living costs and reduced real wages are impoverishing the working masses of Brazil. The "People's Daily" pointed out that according to underestimated official figures, there were 63,000 beggars in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1950, and the number has increased since then. Exhausted, ragged men, women and children wander around the city's squares and streets, searching for food everywhere.
    The "People's Daily" said that the Brazilian people have never suffered like they do today. "1952 was a terrible year for our people. It was a year of soaring prices." (Xinhua News Agency)

    资本主义国家劳动人民生活越来越困难
    美英日等国物价上涨人民生活水平降低
    美国劳动人民生活费用不断上涨
    苏联“真理报”九日发表驻纽约记者利托希科的文章，评述美国生活费用不断上涨的情况。
    他说：美国劳动人民在战后由于物价上涨已损失数百亿美元。
    粮食价格无穷尽的上涨，使美国工人家庭的经济情况遭到沉重打击。与战前比较起来，粮食价格的指数在去年年底增加了二点三倍。肉类、牛奶、蔬菜、水果和其他食物的价格上涨得特别厉害。
    利托希科进一步指出：即使按照官方数字计算，主要食品的每人消费量在一九五二年初也比一九四六年减少了很多，例如：牛油减少了百分之七点六，肉类百分之十，新鲜水果百分之十三点九，面粉百分之十四点七，咖啡百分之十七点六。人民买不起富于营养的食物，用营养价值较差的食物来代替。
    利托希科说：应该指出，虽然美国消费量越来越减缩，这却毫不影响做食物生意及开设联号商店的垄断资本家的利润。相反地，他们的利润正不断增加。垄断资本家使粮食保持很高的垄断价格，从而取得庞大的利润。
    美国劳动人民的生活程度不仅由于粮食价格和一般消费品价格日益上涨而受到影响。到四月三十日房租管制法律废除之后，他们的生活程度将受到同样沉重的打击。据报纸消息透露：对于三千万房客来说，这将是房租再提高约百分之四十。
    纽约州当局最近决定，从五月一日开始，纽约房租将提高百分之十五，虽然现在房租已占工人收入的三分之一以上。但是纽约居民的苦处还不仅是这样一些。不久地下电车的票价将增加百分之五十，还有消息说票价将增加百分之一百到百分之二百。向职工征收的市政捐税还要增加，消费税也将增加，而这些捐税主要又是要取自劳动人民。纽约工人估计，州、市政府当局的这些措施，今年从每一个工人将再多搜括一百五十美元。
    普通的美国人民为了对付生活，照例被迫赊账。在一九五三年，消费者的负债已比一九四五年大八倍以上。
    利托希科最后写道：以上这些事实说明，美国千百万劳动人民每天怎样为着生活而担忧奔忙。
    日本人民的生活水平愈来愈低
    复活日本军国主义政策对日本人民生活所造成的恶劣影响，愈来愈显著了。千百万日本劳动人民正过着入不敷出的困苦生活。
    生活费用一天天在高涨。从一九五二年年底起，首先再度涨价的是生活必需品和公用事业。房租涨了百分之五十六点四，大米涨了百分之九点七。国营铁道的货运费涨了百分之十、客运费涨了百分之十三点五，煤气费涨了百分之十四点五。仅仅根据官方缩小了的数字，日本零售物价在一九五二年已经涨到战前一九三四—一九三六年平均水平的三百多倍。据共同社估计，一九五三年日本国内消费品的价格将继续上涨百分之四到百分之五。苛捐杂税对日本人民生活的威胁也在一天天增加。据大藏省最近发表的经过缩小的数字，在一九五三年，日本人民每人平均负担的捐税将为收入的百分之二十点四，比战前一九三四—一九三六年增加百分之七点六。
    在生活费用上涨和捐税增加的影响下，劳动人民的实际收入一天天地减少，生活水平愈来愈下降。他们的家庭每月都在入不敷出的情况下过着艰苦的生活。特别是遍布全国的半失业工人生活更苦。以长野县散工的家庭为例，据全日本土建一般工会长野分会就许多散工家庭调查的结果表明：一个有家属四五口人的散工家庭，每月平均最低的生活支出也要九千三百一十日元，但实际上一个散工每月所得的工资收入包括津贴在内平均只有五千六百一十日元。在这样少的收入中，每月仅付出主食和副食的费用就要五千四百八十日元，占全部收入的百分之九十七以上。
    为了弥补工资的不足，许多散工不得不在整日繁重的劳动之后，兼作各种的零活。还有许多家庭为了弥补家计的开销，不得不依靠借贷、变卖东西和兼营各种副业以至忍痛出卖子女等方法来暂时维持全家的生活。
    英国人民生活条件恶化
    英国政府推行战争政策的结果，通货膨胀，人民生活条件恶化。
    军事开支在英国政府的开支中占着很大的一部分。一九五二—一九五三年度，直接军事费用超过十五亿英镑，占全部开支的约百分之三十五。如把其他间接用于军事的费用和偿付战争债款的数目加在一起，共达二十一亿余英镑，约为一九五一年国民收入的百分之二十二。巨大的军费开支造成巨大的财政赤字。一九五二—一九五三年度，赤字达四亿英镑以上。
    英国政府采取了加重捐税和增发纸币的办法。自二次大战结束以来，英国捐税已增加了一倍，占全部国民收入的百分之三十四。通货流通额目前比朝鲜战争前增加了将近五分之一，为大战前的三倍。滥发纸币的结果，使得英镑购买力不断跌落，目前一英镑已只值大战前的九个先令，贬值一半以上。
    捐税增加、通货膨胀和削减粮食津贴大大地刺激了物价的上涨。一九五二年零售物价指数平均比一九四八年的水平上升了百分之二十六。实际涨价的情况远比官方统计的为剧。据工党议员刘易斯一月间在下院举出的材料，几种主要食品如面粉、面包、牛油、肉等的价格，单单在一九五二年就上涨了百分之二十到八十六不等。在这一年内，英国生活费用平均上涨了百分之十一。
    由于生活费用高涨，工人实际工资较大战前减少了百分之二十。越来越多的英国人抱怨生活比战前坏多了，英国的人口比战前增加了将近百分之六，可是去年全国牛油的总消费量比战前减少了近百分之五十二。由于在战后继续把大量经费用在维持大量军队和扩充军备方面，英国人民生活一直还受着战时实施的配给制的限制；而且，随着物价的不断上涨，以及大量削减民用必需品的入口，配给量越来越少了。“论坛”双周刊说，一九五二年每星期的牛油配给量是两盎司到三盎司，这是过去五年来最低的配给量。虽然如此，今年的配给量依然是有减无增。例如咸肉配给量本来就很少，自一月二十五日起又削减了百分之二十。目前，每星期肉类配给的体积比一个火柴盒大不了多少。高昂的价格使得所谓配给对许多工人家庭也变成有名无实，愈来愈多的家庭连这点稀少的配给也买不起。据“每日先驱报”统计，去年八月份，有一百八十四万八千人没有买他们的肉类配给，到十二月份，这个数目增加到了二百三十一万八千人。
    目前已成为英国全国性的灾难的房荒是扩张军备的另一个直接恶果。英国政府拿出上十亿英镑的巨款从事扩充军备，但在建筑人民迫切需要的房屋上的拨款却微不足道。根据英国官方的数字，用在战争准备上的款项相等于用在房屋建筑上的款项的二十二倍。据估计，现在英国全国缺少民房六百万所，仅伦敦一地，需要住房的就有二十多万家。在各城市里，成千上万的家庭没有房子住。由于房荒所引起的房租涨价，更加重了一般人民的生活负担。
    落在英国人民身上的另一个灾难是失业的增加。一九五一、一九五二两年，失业连续增加。目前在英国，有近五十万全部失业的工人，较一九五○年底时增加了三分之一以上。除此之外，至少还有同样数目的半失业工人。这些失业工人的生活条件更加恶劣。
    英国垄断资本家为了攫取更多的利润，不顾英国人民的困苦处境，把从四月一日起本年度的直接军事费用再增加到十六亿三千六百七十六万英镑，比一九五二—一九五三年度又增加了百分之八，但是经过一再削减的粮食补贴及社会福利事业费用却仍旧限制在极低的水平。由于英镑购买力的不断下降，这些费用实际上是更缩小了。
    英国劳动人民在过去一年间，为了反对英国政府追随美国的扩军备战政策，为了争取提高工资和改善生活条件，他们曾举行了千百次的集会、罢工、抗议和游行示威。
    拉丁美洲国家物价飞涨民不聊生
    在拉丁美洲国家，一方面劳动人民的实际工资和购买力不断下降，另一方面食品和消费品的价格正飞跃上涨。
    据官方材料，在巴西，一九五二年食品价格指数达到五八六·八（以一九三九年为一百）。”经济与财政观察家报”指出，一九五二年联邦区食品价格上涨了百分之三十，在圣保罗上涨了百分之二十七。
    “晨邮报”指出，主要生活必需品的价格正迅速上涨。不只在巴西东部和闹旱灾的东北部各州饥馑成灾，即使在巴西首都里约热内卢也屡屡发生饥荒。
    生活费用上涨和实际工资降低使巴西劳动群众日益贫穷化。“人民报”指出，据官方低估了的数字，一九五○年里约热内卢市共有六万三千名乞丐，从那时以后数目还有增加。精神疲怠、衣衫褴褛的男人、妇女和儿童在市内的广场和大街上彷徨，到处寻找食物。
    “人民报”说，巴西人民从来没像今日这样受罪。“一九五二年对我国人民来说是可怕的一年。它是物价飞涨的一年。”（据新华社讯）
