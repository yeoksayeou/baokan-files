Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 2nd—According to TASS, New York, April 1st: The American people's living standards are suffering a new blow: food prices are rising, rents are constantly increasing, federal and local taxes continue to increase, and the costs of lighting, heating, telephones, and even medical care are also becoming more expensive.

Even the official statistics, which intentionally conceal the true situation of rising living costs, show that the burden of living expenses is constantly increasing.

According to the Labor Department's figures, food prices have risen by about 65 percent since the war.

According to the Department of Agriculture's statistics, the average annual consumption of meat per person decreased by 13 pounds from 1947 to 1952, milk and cheese decreased by 35 pounds, and vegetables decreased by 31 pounds.

The government's recent lifting of price controls has already caused a sharp rise in the retail prices of coffee, beer, and cigarettes. In some areas, the prices of basic necessities such as bread and milk have also increased.

Along with the rise in the prices of consumer goods, rents have also risen sharply. On March 30, New York Governor Dewey signed a bill allowing rents to be increased by 15 percent.

The Labor Research Association's "Economic Review" reported that rents in Milwaukee have risen by 42 percent in the past three years. In Battle Creek (Michigan), rents have risen by 39 percent in the past twenty-one months. In the working-class residential areas of the industrial center of Toledo (Ohio), rents have risen by 55 percent.

In addition to rents and retail prices, subway and bus fares in New York are also in danger of being increased.

    美人民生活水平下降
    食物价格上涨，捐税继续增加
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约一日讯：美国人民生活遭到新的打击：食物价格上涨，房租不断提高，联邦和地方捐税续增，照明、取暖、电话以至医药费用也更贵了。
    即使官方的有意掩盖生活费用上升的真实情况的统计，也说明生活费用负担不断增加。
    根据劳工部的数字，食物价格战后涨了约百分之六十五。
    据农业部的统计，每人每年肉类平均消费量从一九四七年到一九五二年减少了十三磅，牛乳和乳酪减少了三十五磅，蔬菜减少了三十一磅。
    政府新近取消物价管制，已经引起咖啡、啤酒和纸烟的零售价格急剧上涨。在某些地区，像面包和牛乳这样的基本必需品也涨了价。
    随着消费品的涨价，房租也急剧上升。三月三十日，纽约州州长杜威签署了一项法案，准许房租提高百分之十五。
    劳工研究协会的“经济评论”报道，在过去三年内，密尔窝基城的房租涨了百分之四十二。过去二十一个月内，贝特尔溪（密执安州）的房租涨了百分之三十九。在工业中心多勒多（俄亥俄州）的工人居住区，房租涨了百分之五十五。
    除了房租和零售价格，纽约的地下电车和公共汽车票价也有加价的危险。
