The study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union by cadres throughout the North China region concluded successively by mid-January of this year. The scale of this study was very large, with almost all cadres studying theory at the high, middle, and primary levels participating. In Hebei Province alone, more than 39,600 cadres from government agencies, enterprises, and middle school teachers and staff members studied theory, while in the directly subordinate leagues and cities of Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan and directly subordinate agencies, the number was 19,396. At the beginning of the study, responsible comrades in various localities generally made mobilization reports and called on responsible comrades at all levels to take the lead and guide the study of their subordinate units. During the study of the second and third parts of Malenkov's report, emphasis was placed on linking with reality and conducting self-examination of work and thought in conjunction with the study. At the end of the study, many units held tests, and many people wrote study心得 [xinde: reflections/notes on what they have learned]. Shanxi also specially organized responsible comrades from various departments of the Provincial People's Government to make special reports on their study心得 in connection with their departmental work. This study was led from beginning to end, so the gains were great. The main gains are as follows:

First, a clear and systematic understanding of the current international situation has been achieved, reversing many comrades' erroneous views on the world situation; the nature and significance of the peace movement have been recognized, and confidence in the world peace and democracy movement has been enhanced. In the past, many cadres lacked international knowledge and had a one-sided understanding of the world situation, generally only understanding the international contradictions between the two major camps, and failing to see the development and intensification of contradictions between imperialists. By studying the different situations of the two opposing camps with two different futures, as well as the struggle between imperialists, and analyzing the characteristics of imperialism, it became clear that the contradictions between imperialists are deepening and intensifying. In the past, some cadres also had ideas of worshipping and fearing the United States, lacking confidence in the struggle against imperialism; some cadres underestimated the role of peaceful struggle and had rash and impetuous emotions, thinking that "demanding peace is a sign of weakness," etc. These erroneous understandings have been basically corrected in the study. In studying the Soviet Union's policy of consolidating and safeguarding peace, the strength of the peace and democracy camp and the great significance of the peace and democracy movement were recognized, thus increasing hatred for imperialist warmongers and determination to do a good job in the peace movement and national defense construction, changing some people's reluctance to study international issues. This study of the international situation not only broadened the minds of cadres, but also laid the foundation for future study of political current events.

Second, a further deep understanding has been gained of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, the correct road to industrialization in socialist countries, and the significance of industrialization in national construction. Generally, cadres have specifically recognized the greatness of the Soviet Union from some rich, vivid, and persuasive examples and figures in the second part of Malenkov's report. Therefore, the confidence and determination to learn from the Soviet Union and build the motherland have been strengthened, and the idea of "leaning to one side" has been further solidified. Some more responsible veteran cadres, in studying the Soviet Union's construction experience, have gained a deeper understanding of the principles and policies of first developing heavy industry in our country's economic construction by linking it with their own work and self-examination. For example, after studying the Soviet Union's policy of first developing heavy industry in industrial construction, the leading comrades of the Cangxian Special District Enterprise Company clarified the idea of focusing on key construction. And they examined the past egalitarianism in leadership and investment, which did not distinguish between the importance of different sectors, and clearly recognized the decisive significance of heavy industry in transforming the national economy. Cadres in general departments, combined with the study of relevant parts of the documents, examined their thoughts and work, and their ideological and professional levels have also been improved. The cadres of the Guisui Flour Mill said: "Only after studying the internal situation of the Soviet Union can we better appreciate the significance of what Chairman Mao said about the first step of the Long March being completed." In the past, many departments had insufficient understanding of national construction plans: when preparing plans, there was insufficient communication between departments, and inspection of the implementation of plans was also insufficient, and plans often became a mere formality. After study, discussion, and examination, the leadership in various localities has paid attention to this. For example, the Shijiazhuang Special District Cooperative examined the problem of fertilizer reserves. In 1951, 3 million catties were reserved but not sold, and in 1952, 5 million catties were reserved but there was still insufficient supply. As a result, funds were tied up and production improvement was affected, all of which were the result of not paying attention to planning. In addition, some regions also combined study with examination of issues such as conservation, cost reduction, capital accumulation, and improvement of labor organization, and on this basis, improved their thinking and improved their work.

Third, the importance of criticism and self-criticism and the party's political and ideological leadership has also been enhanced in understanding. After the study, the majority of technicians and some new cadres criticized the erroneous ideas that "criticism is just fault-finding" and "criticism will cause disunity"; some old cadres also recognized the errors of vulgarizing criticism and self-criticism, neglecting and suppressing opinions from below, and being unwilling to accept criticism, and recognized that criticism and self-criticism are important methods for continuously improving the party's work, strengthening the party's ties with the people, and fully leveraging their enthusiasm and creativity. On this basis, some units in Hebei Province launched a bottom-up criticism movement at the end of the study. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee exposed and criticized a large number of phenomena of suppressing democracy and not accepting criticism in the organs. Leading cadres in some agencies in Shanxi Province realized that criticism and self-criticism should be institutionalized and become a habit, especially promoting criticism and suggestions from the lower levels and the broad masses, which should form a trend and run through daily work and life. Regarding strengthening the party's political and ideological leadership, some regions combined study with inspection of branch work. During the inspection, everyone deeply realized that the party's political and ideological work should be regularized, and the main tasks of the party branch were recognized, so the idea that administrative work and party work are contradictory, which some party members held, was also eliminated. In addition, there was further clear understanding of organization, discipline, unity and centralization, and the phenomenon of disunity among some cadres has also changed greatly.

The following three experiences were gained in this study:

First, the combination of responsible cadres and general cadres in learning has a great role in guiding and promoting the learning of general cadres. Leading by example and paying attention to learning is the key to the in-depth development of this study. Responsible cadres participating in the learning leadership, making enlightening reports in connection with reality, and answering difficult questions can easily create a learning upsurge. The Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Branch Bureau adopted the method of "leadership promotion, branch initiative" to promote leaders at all levels, which shows that as long as the branch takes the initiative, the leadership promotes it, plus timely inspection, criticism, and commendation, the study can be carried out.

Second, linking with reality in the study should have a clear purpose, and the leadership should be aware of it, which can not only deepen the study, but also consolidate the learning results. First of all, we must guide everyone to carefully study the spirit and essence of the documents, so that everyone clearly understands the basic tasks of their department and the current overall tasks. Then, we should examine past work and thoughts in connection. Whether the tasks have been completed in the past, whether they have been completed well, and where the key lies, after examination, we can formulate improvement measures, and the study can achieve practical results. Otherwise, a general connection, a general examination, not grasping the main problems, not grasping the central link, no matter how many trivial problems are examined, it is difficult to change the work, and the learning results cannot be consolidated.

Third, grasp key areas and key departments, conduct key leadership, and exchange experiences in a timely manner to promote the general. Only typical demonstration leadership is specific and practical leadership, which can make the study progress. Study without organizational leadership is not possible, but only carrying out organizational leadership and neglecting ideological leadership will also affect the effect of the study.

    华北区全区干部学习马林科夫报告的收获和经验
    华北区全区干部学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件，到今年一月中旬已先后结束。这次的学习规模很大，所有高、中、初级学习理论的干部，几乎都参加了这一学习。仅河北省学习理论的机关、企业干部和中等学校教职员即达三万九千六百多人，蒙绥直属盟、市及直属机关干部一万九千三百九十六人。学习开始时，各地负责同志一般都做了动员报告，并号召各级负责同志带头，将所属单位的学习领导好。在学习马林科夫报告的第二、三部分时，强调了联系实际，结合学习对工作和思想进行了检查。学习结束时，许多单位举行了测验，不少人写了学习心得。山西还专门组织了省人民政府各厅负责同志结合本部门业务做了学习心得的专题报告。这次学习领导有始有终，因此收获很大。主要的收获有以下几点：
    一、对当前国际形势有了明确系统的认识，扭转了很多同志对世界形势的某些错误观点；认识了和平运动的性质与意义，增强了对世界和平民主运动的信心。过去不少干部对国际知识缺乏，对世界形势认识得片面，一般只了解国际矛盾在两大阵营之间，看不到帝国主义之间矛盾的发展和尖锐。由于学习了两个对立营垒两个发展前途的不同情况，以及帝国主义之间的斗争，分析了帝国主义的特点，就清楚地认识到帝国主义之间的矛盾是日益加深和剧烈起来。过去有些干部还存在着崇美、恐美思想，缺乏与帝国主义斗争的信心；一部分干部轻视和平斗争的作用，存在着轻率急躁情绪，认为“要求和平是表示软弱”等，这些错误认识，在学习中基本上得到纠正。在学习苏联巩固和保卫和平的政策中，认识到和平民主阵营的强大、和平民主运动的伟大意义，因而对帝国主义战争贩子更加仇恨，决心搞好和平运动，搞好国防建设，改变了某些人不愿学习国际问题的态度。这次国际形势的学习，不但使干部开阔了思想，同时也给今后学习政治时事打下了基础。
    二、对社会主义制度无比的优越性，对社会主义国家工业化的正确道路和工业化在国家建设中的意义，有了进一步的深刻了解。一般干部从马林科夫报告第二部分中的一些丰富生动具有说服力的事例和数字中，具体地认识到苏联的伟大。因而加强了学习苏联、建设祖国的信心和决心，更坚定了“一边倒”的思想。一部分比较负责的老干部，在学习苏联的建设经验中，由于联系检查了自己的工作，对我国经济建设首先发展重工业的方针和原则体会得更加深刻。如沧县专区企业公司的领导同志，学习了苏联在工业建设中首先发展重工业的方针以后，重点建设的思想是明确了。并且检查了过去在领导上和投资上轻重不分的平均主义思想，清楚地认识了在改造国家经济中重工业的决定意义。一般部门的干部，结合学习文件有关部分，检查了思想和工作，思想水平和业务水平也提高了。归绥面粉厂的干部说：“学习了苏联的内部情况，才更体会到毛主席所说的万里长征走完了第一步的意义。”对于国家建设计划过去许多部门是认识不足的：编制计划时，部门之间联系不够，对计划执行的检查也不够，往往计划流于形式。经过学习、讨论和检查，各地领导方面已都予以重视。如石家庄专区合作社，检查了备肥问题，一九五一年备了三百万斤没销出去，一九五二年备了五百万斤又供不应求，因而积压资金又影响生产的提高，这都是不重视计划的结果。另外有些地区对节约问题、降低成本问题、积累资金问题、改善劳动组织问题，也都结合学习进行了检查，并在这基础上提高了思想，改进了工作。
    三、对批评与自我批评和党的政治思想领导的重要性，在认识上也提高了。经过学习，多数技术人员及部分新干部批判了认为“批评就是找岔子”和“批评会造成不团结”等错误思想；部分老干部也认识到把批评与自我批评庸俗化以及忽视和抑制下面意见、不愿接受批评的错误，认识到批评与自我批评是不断提高党的工作、加强党与人民群众的联系，充分发挥其积极性和创造力的重要方法。在这基础上，河北省有些单位，在学习终了时，都开展了一次自下而上的批评运动。石家庄地委大量揭发和批判了机关中存在的压制民主和不接受批评的现象。山西省有些机关的领导干部认识到应该把批评与自我批评形成制度和习惯，特别是发扬来自下层和广大群众的批评建议，应该形成风气，并贯串到日常工作和生活中去。对加强党的政治思想领导，有些地区结合学习检查了支部工作。在检查中，大家深刻体会到应把党的政治思想工作经常化起来，认识了党的支部的主要任务，因之一部分党员认为行政工作和党的工作有抵触的思想也消除了。另外对组织性、纪律性、统一与集中等也都有了进一步明确的认识，某些干部之间的不团结现象，也大有改变。
    这次学习中获得了下面三点经验：
    一、负责干部与一般干部学习相结合，对指导和推动一般干部的学习作用很大。首长带头和重视学习，是这次学习深入开展起来的关键。负责干部参加学习领导，联系实际作启发报告，解答疑难问题，就容易造成学习热潮。蒙绥分局关于推动各级领导，采取了“领导推动，支部主动”的办法，说明只要支部主动，领导推动，再加上及时检查，进行批评和表扬，学习就能搞起来。
    二、在学习中联系实际要有明确目的，领导方面要心中有数，这不仅能使学习深入，而且也能巩固学习成果。首先要指导大家认真钻研文件的精神和实质，使大家明确认识自己部门的基本任务和当前总任务。然后再联系检查过去的工作和思想。过去是否完成了任务，完成得好不好，关键在那里，经过检查，订出改进办法，学习才能收到实效。否则泛泛地联系，泛泛地检查，不抓主要问题，不抓中心环节，琐碎问题检查得再多，工作也很难转变，学习成果也不能巩固。
    三、掌握重点地区，重点部门，进行重点领导，及时交流经验，推动一般。只有典型示范的领导，才是具体实际的领导，才能使学习前进。学习没有组织领导是不行的，但只进行组织领导，忽视思想领导，也会影响到学习的效果。
