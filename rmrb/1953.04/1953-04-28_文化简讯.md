	PLA Units to Hold Cultural and Educational Examinations in May

	To assess the actual results of the troops' cultural and educational work over the past year, and to further consolidate and improve the cultural level of the troops, the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will hold a large-scale cultural and educational examination in May this year.

	After a year of intense cultural learning movement, the cultural level of the troops participating in cultural learning has significantly improved. The units participating in cultural learning have basically eliminated illiteracy, laying a solid foundation for completing the task of building a regularized and modernized army. This May examination will be a major review of the troops' cultural learning and a major mobilization for future regular cultural learning.

	Currently, leading cadres, all teachers, and all students in various units are conducting a comprehensive review of teaching methods, teaching leadership, and other issues. The broad masses of commanders and fighters are intensifying their studies to strive for excellent results in the examination. Many units have launched a new upsurge in cultural learning.

	Through the preparations for the May examination, various units have generally improved their teaching effectiveness. In an arithmetic test in a certain unit of the Northwest Military Region, the overall average score was 91.7, an increase of 10.1 points compared to the past. Due to the active efforts of all teachers and students in the Logistics Department of the Southwest Military Region, 80% of the students achieved scores of 4 or 5 in the recent semester examination. The Gu Hongji group of Senior Elementary Level A achieved full marks in both language and arithmetic. For the natural science unit "Astronomy," which is generally considered difficult to understand and teach, Li Yongming, a student from the Jiangjin Military Sub-district of the Sichuan Military Region, actively studied it, made a globe with oranges, and worked with his group members. One person read the textbook, and everyone else did the experiments, quickly learning the principles of the sun, moon, and stars, day and night, seasons, solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, and so on.
