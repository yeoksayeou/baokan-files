    中国人民志愿军某部高级指挥机关通令表扬
    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】中国人民志愿军某部高级指挥机关通令表扬金城前线某炮兵连队的战斗。这个连队以八分钟的炮击消灭了敌军两个炮兵连。
    三月三十日清晨，金城前线九岘里东沟的敌军炮火不断地向我军阵地轰击。十一时十五分以后，我军观察员发现敌军卡车十九辆，吉普车五辆开到九岘里东沟集结。
    我军炮兵指挥员接到敌军集结的报告后，立即命令炮兵部队向九岘里东沟进行猛烈地轰击。炮兵们第一次排射，就打毁了敌人许多卡车和大炮；第二和第三次排射，冰雹一样的炮弹在敌军阵地上炸起六处大火，并炸中敌军弹药库一处。此后该处敌军再未发出一炮，大火一直烧了三小时。
    据清查战果的报告，我军炮兵连在八分钟的轰击中，共计歼灭了敌军两个炮兵连（十二门榴弹炮）；炸毁敌军十九辆卡车、五辆吉普车及弹药、汽油等军用物资一部。
