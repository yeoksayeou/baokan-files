Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations has been universally welcomed in Japan.

According to the "Akahata" newspaper, Ii Yashiro, the Secretary-General of the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace, stated: "Premier Zhou Enlai's statement is like seeing the sun after the clouds have parted for our people. We hope that the United States will sincerely accept this proposal."

Many trade union organizations have also expressed their welcoming sentiments. The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions issued a statement expressing full support for Premier Zhou Enlai's statement. Takano Minoru, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, also issued a statement welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, saying: "For the sake of world peace, we hope to end the Korean War as soon as possible." Kominami Hirohisa, Chairman of the National Federation of Financial Institutions Workers' Unions, believes that if peace comes, although the military industry will suffer, the peace industry will improve; at the same time, the possibility of trade between Japan and its neighbors China and the Soviet Union, which have vast markets, will also increase. He also said: Now is the time for Japanese workers to muster their courage, unite the forces of peace, and move forward on the road to happiness.

Lee Ho-ran, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic United Front of Korean Residents in Japan, in his statement welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, emphasized the need to realize the Korean armistice.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th: According to a report in London's "Daily Worker": At a meeting convened in Glasgow last week by the "Daily Worker" to discuss "British Labor Problems," many people in their speeches supported the proposals of the Korean and Chinese sides on the Korean armistice negotiations and called for a swift realization of peace. One hundred and seventy-one delegates attended the meeting, more than half of whom were trade union representatives.

John Gollan, Deputy Editor of the "Daily Worker," chaired the meeting, and he believed that the extraordinary development of the past three weeks was the great action for peace taken by the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. However, he also said that both sides must show good faith.

N. Milligan, a representative of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, said that when he collected signatures for a petition supporting the Chinese and Korean plan, not a single person refused to sign the petition.

The British Trades Union Congress also welcomed the new proposals from the Soviet Union and China last weekend and urged that all means be used to end the war.

The "Daily Worker" published an editorial, pointing out that the United States, facing the Korean and Chinese proposals supported by the Soviet Union, will quibble for months over the issue of neutral nations. The editorial called on the British people to put pressure on the Conservative government to do its best to facilitate the resolution of the prisoner of war repatriation issue in order to achieve peace.
