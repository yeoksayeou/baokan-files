According to a letter from Comrade Yu Xiang of the Tangshan Municipal People's Government Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry indiscriminately issues official forms without understanding the situation. The suburban work committee of Tangshan City was established in June of last year and officially began operations in July. By the end of the year, it had received a total of seventy-six instructions and notices from the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry (not including telegram instructions and written circulars). In September alone, it received five instructions and fourteen notices. In October, it received another five instructions and twelve notices,代电(dai dian - telegraphs to be replied to) and forms. These documents mostly concern requests for model experiences, surveys and form-filling, launching campaigns, and summarizing work. This work must be done through district cadres. However, the agriculture and construction sections in the suburbs of Tangshan City have at most four cadres and at least one. Not only are there few people, but their education level is low, and they are also doing both agricultural and construction work. In addition to the instructions from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, other agencies and departments inevitably assign work to various districts and villages. Village cadres are not only unable to do this work well, but sometimes they do not even have enough time to read the documents. Many village cadres often delay production because they cannot finish their work, and they often cannot sleep until late at night. Because district cadres have not yet studied the documents well themselves, they let village cadres do the work, so deviations often occur in the implementation of policies, causing unnecessary losses. Many village cadres are "battered from all sides" by superiors, the masses, and their families, and they cannot stand it and leave the village to work in factories. This situation is very serious.

Many of the notices and instructions from the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry are issued generally without understanding the situation. During the evaluation and election of agricultural labor models last year, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry initially notified Tangshan City and Qinhuangdao City to send two provincial labor models; however, Qinhuangdao City has very few villages, while Tangshan City has more than three hundred villages. Tangshan City considered this unreasonable and called the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry for instructions, requesting to speak to a more responsible comrade. At that time, it was agreed that two labor models and two preferential treatment models could be sent. Later, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry did not acknowledge the telephone reply. Soon, a second notice was received, asking Tangshan City to send four labor models. Soon after, a third notice was received, asking Tangshan City to send six labor models. Three times, three different numbers, making it unclear which one to follow. Tangshan City called the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry again for instructions, and the final answer was that nine could be sent. In February of this year, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry stipulated that Tangshan City should have three agricultural technicians, the same as Fengfeng Mining District and other places. After the director of the Tangshan Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau raised his opinion, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry realized that Tangshan City had more than three hundred villages, and as a result, it agreed to set up twenty positions. There are even more ridiculous things: when evaluating labor models last year, the instructions from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry required the evaluation to be completed by the end of September, and also said to "thresh in the fields, inspect in the fields, clear the measures, and weigh clearly." However, at the end of September, Tangshan City's sorghum, corn, cotton, sweet potatoes, etc., were not yet ripe!

The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's carelessness in assigning work also causes errors at the lower levels, which has a very bad impact on the masses. Last December, Comrade Guo Jingchun from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry came to Tangshan City to convey the bonus and award methods for increased production. Because there were errors in the mimeographed text of the Agricultural Policy Section of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Guo Jingchun omitted one of the seven conditions for applying for an award when conveying the message (namely, for areas affected by disasters in 1951, the increased production figures for 1952 should be compared with the past normal annual output, not based on the output of 1951). The award method stipulated that an increase of 30 percent over 1951 would be eligible for an award. Because Tangshan City's suburbs suffered disasters in 1951 and the output was low, if compared with the output of 1951, there would be too many in Tangshan City who would be eligible for an award. As a result, it was impossible to implement, and it was changed twice, causing a very bad impact on the masses. When it was impossible to implement, the Tangshan Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau reported it to the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry asked the Tangshan Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau to send someone to the department. The head of the Agricultural Policy Section of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry knew that Guo Jingchun had conveyed the wrong information and called Guo Jingchun to reprimand him. Guo Jingchun took out the mimeographed text of the Agricultural Policy Section as a basis. The head of the Agricultural Policy Section had nothing to say.

In his letter, Comrade Yu Xiang suggests that higher-level agencies should understand the situation when issuing instructions and notices, estimate the strength of district and village cadres, consider the different conditions of each region, and consider what other work is being carried out at the same time. The work of each department of the Provincial People's Government each quarter should be rationally arranged in a unified manner. When higher levels assign work, they should clearly highlight what is the current central task to avoid the error of not distinguishing between the importance and urgency.

### 唐山市人民政府农林局工作人员反映  河北省农林厅不了解下情滥发公文

    唐山市人民政府农林局工作人员反映
    河北省农林厅不了解下情滥发公文
    据唐山市人民政府农林局于祥同志来信谈，河北省农林厅滥发公文表格，不了解下情。唐山市自去年六月成立了郊区工作委员会，七月正式办公；到年底就收到河北省农林厅的指示、通知等共七十六件（电讯指示及文字通报不在内），仅在九月份就收到指示五件、通知十四件；十月份又收到指示五件，通知、代电、表格共十二件。这些文件，多是要典型经验、调查填表、开展运动、总结工作等事情。这些工作都必须通过区干部去做。但唐山市各郊区农业建设股最多的才有四个干部，少的只有一个干部。不但人少，而且文化水平低，又是兼做农业和建设工作的。除了农林厅的指示之外，其他机关部门也少不了要向各区村布置工作。这些工作各区村干部不但无法做好，而且有时连看文件的时间都感到不足。很多村干部因为工作做不过来，时常耽误生产，晚上经常深夜才能睡觉。因为区干部自己还没有很好地学习文件就让村干部去做，所以在政策的执行上常出偏差，造成不应有的损失。很多村干部在上级机关、群众、家庭之间“三面受气”，受不了就离开村子做工去了。这情况是很严重的。
    河北省农林厅的许多通知、指示是并不了解下情而一般地布置下去的。在去年评比选举农业劳动模范的时候，农林厅第一次通知唐山市及秦皇岛市去省劳动模范两名；但秦皇岛市村庄很少，唐山市则有三百多个村。唐山市认为不合理，给省农林厅去电话请示，并要求找比较负责的同志接电话；当时答应可去劳动模范二名、优抚模范二名。以后农林厅却不承认电话上的答复了。不久又接到第二次通知，让唐山市去四名劳动模范。不久却又接到第三次通知，让唐山市去六名劳动模范。三次三样，使人不知道以那个为准，唐山市就又给省农林厅去电话请示，最后的答复是可以去九名。今年二月，河北省农林厅规定唐山市设农业技术员三名，和峰峰矿区等地一样。经唐山市农林局局长提出意见以后，省农林厅才知道唐山市有三百多个村子，结果才答应设二十名。还有更滑稽的事情：去年评选劳动模范的时候，省农林厅的指示中要求在九月底评选完毕，又说要“场里打、地里验、清过斗，明过秤”。可是，九月底唐山市的高粱、玉米、棉花、甘薯等都还没有熟呢！
    河北省农林厅在布置工作时粗枝大叶，也使下级造成错误，在群众中影响极坏。去年十二月，省农林厅派郭景春同志到唐山市，传达了增产报奖办法。因为省农林厅农政科油印文字有错误，郭景春在传达时把七条报奖条件丢掉了一条（即一九五一年受灾的地区，一九五二年的增产数字应是和过去的常年产量相比较，不以一九五一年的产量为准）。奖励办法上规定较一九五一年增产百分之三十就可以报奖，因唐山市郊区一九五一年是灾年，产量低，如果和一九五一年的产量比较，唐山市够报奖条件的就太多了。结果，执行不通，又两次更改，在群众中造成了很不好的影响。当执行不通时，唐山市农林局就向省农林厅作了报告。省农林厅就要唐山市农林局派人到厅里去。省农林厅农政科科长知道是郭景春传达错了，就把郭景春叫来责备。郭景春就把农政科油印的文字拿出来作根据。农政科长这才无话可说了。
    于祥同志的来信中建议：上级机关发指示、通知应当了解下情，估计到区村干部的力量，顾及各地区不同的条件，顾及同时进行的还有些什么工作。省人民政府各厅各个季度的工作，应统一地作出合理的安排。上级布置工作时，要把什么是当前的中心任务明确地突出出来，以免发生轻重缓急不分的错误。
