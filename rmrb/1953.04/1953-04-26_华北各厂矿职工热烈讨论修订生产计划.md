    North China Factories and Mines Workers Enthusiastically Discuss Revising Production Plans
    In order to ensure the balanced implementation of production according to the national plan, workers in factories and mines in the North China region are enthusiastically discussing the revision of the 1953 industrial production plan. In Hebei Province alone, 589 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines have mobilized workers to discuss the plan. In Tianjin and Beijing, one-third of the factories and mines have already completed the discussions. All localities attach great importance to the leadership of the plan revision. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee and the First and Second District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party sent 20 work groups to key factories to assist in the work.
    In this discussion of the plan, all factories and mines have emphasized the scientific and advanced nature of the plan. When discussing coal consumption at the Tangshan Power Plant, the final advanced figure was determined based on three different opinions. The plant's 1953 output targets, which had been seriously mobilized for discussion and revision by the workers, were on average 10 to 20 percent higher than the original targets.
    In order to ensure the complete realization of the revised production plan, factories and mines in various localities have also formulated labor plans, cost plans, and organizational measures plans. In the discussion of the plan at the Tianjin Water Company, technicians and veteran workers established seven professional and technical research associations, and integrated 390 tips proposed by the masses into 30 technical measures to ensure the realization of the plan.
    State-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the North China region had prepared the 1953 plan before the new year, but most of them were based on statistics or estimated quotas. The quotas after verification have generally exceeded the quotas at the time of the original plan preparation. For this reason, it is necessary to properly review and revise the original plan to make it more in line with reality and play an active role in organizing and promoting production development. This is a necessary measure to strengthen planning management.

    华北各厂矿职工热烈讨论修订生产计划
    为保证按国家计划均衡地进行生产，华北区各工厂矿山职工正在热烈地讨论修订一九五三年工业生产计划。只河北省国营与地方国营发动职工讨论计划的厂矿就有五百八十九个。天津、北京两市已有三分之一的厂矿已经讨论完毕。各地对修订计划的领导都很重视，中共太原市委员会和一、二区委员会曾派出二十个工作组到各重点厂去协助工作。
    各厂矿在这次讨论计划中都很强调计划的科学性和先进性。唐山发电厂在讨论煤耗量时，根据三种不同意见的数字，最后确定了先进的数字。该厂凡是经过认真发动职工群众讨论、修订的计划，比原订的一九五三年产量指标平均提高了百分之十到二十。
    为了保证所修订的生产计划彻底实现，各地厂矿还订立了劳动计划、成本计划和组织措施计划。天津自来水公司在讨论计划中，技术人员和老工人成立了七个专业技术研究会，把群众提出的三百九十个窍门，综合为三十个技术措施，来保证计划的实现。
    华北全区国营与地方国营工厂矿山，曾在年前编制了一九五三年计划，但多是根据统计或估计定额制订的。经过查定后的定额一般已超过原编制计划时的定额。为此，有必要把原订计划进行适当的审查与修正，使之更加符合实际，起积极组织推动生产发展的作用。这对加强计划管理工作是一个必要的措施。
