Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: To commemorate Comrade Stalin, welcome "May Day" International Labor Day, and strive to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule, the working people of Poland are enthusiastically launching regular production competitions. According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: As early as the days of mourning Comrade Stalin's passing, the workers of the Starachowice Automobile Factory transformed grief into strength and took the lead in launching a long-term production competition. They called on workers across the country to combine shock-work competitions with regular production movements, and put forward a series of production guarantees to be completed in a planned manner. After this suggestion was disseminated, workers in factories across the country responded enthusiastically and put forward production guarantees ranging from three months to one year. Workers at the Baildon Steel Factory guaranteed to complete the 1953 production plan for all departments of the factory before December 21st (Comrade Stalin's birthday); many production teams within the factory further guaranteed to complete their annual production tasks by December 15th. Workers at the Doles coal mine have decided to overfulfill the April plan by 3,745 tons to celebrate "May Day" and launch a regular production competition from this. Workers at one of Poland's important coal mines, the Gotwald Coal Mine, guaranteed to overproduce 84,570 tons of coal over the plan by the end of this year. Workers at the Gdansk Shipyard on the Baltic coast decided to complete two new ships before June 29th—Polish Shipbuilding Workers' Day—one ship being completed one month ahead of schedule and the other 21 days ahead of schedule. Workers at the Warsaw Automobile Factory also guaranteed to complete the annual production plan before December 21st and reduce the cost of each car by 1,250 zlotys (Polish currency). Currently, the production guarantees of workers in various industries are being successfully implemented.

Polish agricultural workers and cooperative farmers are also enthusiastically participating in long-term competitions. The production guarantees they made during the mourning for Comrade Stalin's passing are being successfully implemented. In the Szczecin Province alone, more than 20 cooperative farms have completed spring plowing. Agricultural workers at the Bwarua State Farm stipulated in their long-term production guarantees that this year's grain yield per unit area should exceed the original plan by 10 percent; sugar beets by 14 percent; and potatoes by 120 percent. Under the influence and leadership of agricultural workers and cooperative farmers, many individual farmers have joined the competition to accelerate the completion of spring plowing.

Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The laboring people of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania are enthusiastically launching production competitions to welcome "May Day" Labor Day.

As early as the beginning of this year, "Red Right," the organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, called on the laboring people of the country to launch a "May Day" production competition to strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) ahead of schedule this year. The January 18th editorial of "Red Right" pointed out: This competition will enable the laboring people of the country to complete the annual production tasks more evenly, avoiding the phenomenon of completing tasks by shock work at the end of the year in the past. Since January, the laboring people of the country have enthusiastically responded to this call and have achieved significant results. In Czechoslovakia's largest steel plant, the K. Gotwald Steel Factory, a steelmaking team had failed to complete its monthly tasks for the past year and a half, but after launching the "May Day" labor competition, it completed 100.4 percent of its production guarantee in February this year. The Molotov Steel Plant in the Tesinec district not only completed the plan on a monthly basis for the entire plant, but also overfulfilled the plan in every workshop. In March, miners at the Orlova and Ostrava-Jug coal mines in Czechoslovakia's largest coal region, the Ostrava-Karvina coal region, overproduced 25,000 tons of coal above the plan. Miners in Slovakia completed 104.2 percent of their plan in March. Workers in other industries in Czechoslovakia are also evenly completing or overfulfilling production plans and the production guarantees they have made.

Enterprises, factories, and construction sites in Bulgaria are launching socialist competitions to welcome "May Day." Miners are at the forefront of the competition. Miners at the "Chumerna" coal mine in the Sliven district have overfulfilled the March plan due to the successful adoption of advanced Soviet work methods. They guarantee to create even greater achievements before May 1st. Many production teams at Bulgaria's largest textile factory, the Telman Textile Factory, have overfulfilled their production guarantees. One team overfulfilled the first quarter plan by 16.3 percent, and shock worker V. Chalkchutova completed 145 percent of the quota. Workers at the G. Dimitrov Agricultural Machinery Factory have put forward 1,750 collective and individual guarantees to welcome "May Day" and are successfully completing these guarantees. Dockworkers at the port of Rom applied advanced Soviet rapid unloading methods, reducing the berthing time of a ship by 26 hours in early April.

Romanian workers are also welcoming "May Day" Labor Day with production competitions. The "Suro Tractor Factory" in Stalin City held a production meeting on the 7th and decided to launch a production competition to welcome "May Day" based on the great achievements in the first quarter. In the first quarter, more than 91 percent of the workers in the factory participated in the socialist competition, and they also put forward 413 rationalization proposals on technology and labor organization. As a result, the factory completed 120 percent of the first quarter production plan, and labor productivity exceeded the plan by 10 percent. In order to expand the first quarter production results and celebrate the festival of the working people of the world, the factory's production meeting guaranteed that it would start producing the quota for May 12th on April 30th; and increase production efficiency by 7 percent and reduce production costs by 2 percent above the plan in April.

    迎接“五一”劳动节争取提前完成生产计划
    波捷保罗等国劳动人民展开竞赛
    【新华社九日讯】波兰劳动人民为纪念斯大林同志，迎接“五一”国际劳动节和争取提前完成今年计划，正在热烈地展开经常性的生产竞赛。据波兰通讯社华沙消息：早在追悼斯大林同志逝世的日子里，斯塔拉霍维茨汽车工厂的工人们，就化悲痛为力量，首先展开了长期的生产竞赛。他们号召全国工人把突击性的竞赛和经常性的生产运动结合起来，并提出一连串的生产保证，有计划地加以完成。这个建议传出后，全国各地工厂的工人们纷纷响应，提出了三个月到一年的生产保证。拜尔顿钢铁工厂的工人保证要在十二月二十一日（斯大林同志的生日）以前完成全厂各部门一九五三年生产计划；厂内的许多生产队更保证在十二月十五日就完成他们的全年生产任务。多列士煤场的工人已决定超过四月份计划多采三千七百四十五吨，来庆祝“五一”节，并由此展开经常性的生产竞赛。波兰重要煤场之一——哥特瓦尔德煤场的工人，保证在今年年底超计划采煤八万四千五百七十吨。波罗的海海岸革但斯克造船厂的工人决定，在六月二十九日——波兰造船工人节以前，要完成两艘新船，一艘比原计划提前一个月完成，另一艘提前二十一天完成。华沙汽车工厂的工人也保证在十二月二十一日前完成全年生产计划、每辆汽车减低成本一千二百五十兹罗提（波币）。现在，各业工人的生产保证正在胜利地执行中。
    波兰的农业工人和合作社农民也踊跃地参加长期竞赛。他们在哀悼斯大林同志逝世时提出的生产保证，正在胜利地执行着，仅斯才新省就有二十多个合作社农场完成了春耕。布瓦华国营农场的农业工人在他们的长期生产保证中规定，今年谷物的单位面积产量要超过原定计划百分之十；甜菜超过百分之十四；马铃薯超过百分之一百二十。在农业工人和合作社农民的影响和带领下，许多个体农民参加了加速完成春耕的竞赛运动。
    【新华社九日讯】捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚三国劳动人民正在热烈展开迎接“五一”劳动节的生产竞赛。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”早在今年年初就号召全国劳动人民展开迎接“五一”节生产竞赛，来争取在今年内提前完成第一个五年计划（一九四九年—一九五三年）。“红色权利报”一月十八日社论中指出：这个竞赛将使全国劳动人民可以更均衡地完成全年度的生产任务，而避免过去在年底用突击的办法来完成任务的现象。全国劳动人民自一月起就热烈响应了这个号召，并且已获得了显著的成就。在捷克斯洛伐克最大的钢铁厂——克·哥特瓦尔德钢铁工厂，有一个炼钢小组在过去一年半中一直没有按月完成任务，但在展开“五一”节劳动竞赛以后，今年二月就完成了生产保证百分之一百点四。特息涅茨区的莫洛托夫钢铁厂不但全厂按月完成了计划，而且厂内每一个车间都超额完成了计划。在三月间，捷克斯洛伐克最大的煤区俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那煤区的奥尔洛瓦和俄斯特拉发—尤格煤场的矿工超计划开采了二万五千吨煤。斯洛伐克的矿工们在三月份完成计划百分之一百零四点二。捷克斯洛伐克其他各业工人也正在均衡地完成或超额完成生产计划和他们所提出的生产保证。
    保加利亚各企业、工厂、建筑工地正在展开迎接“五一”节的社会主义竞赛。矿工们走在竞赛的最前列。斯利文区“楚梅尔纳”煤场的矿工由于成功地采用了苏联的先进工作方法，已超额完成了三月份的计划。他们保证在五月一日前要创造出更大的成绩。保加利亚最大的纺织厂——台尔曼纺织厂的许多生产小组已超额完成了自己的生产保证。有一个组超额完成第一季度计划百分之十六点三，突击工人维·恰尔克楚娃完成定额百分之一百四十五。格·季米特洛夫农业机器工厂的工人为了迎接“五一”节提出了一七五○件集体的和个人的保证，并且正在顺利地完成这些保证。罗姆城的港口码头工人由于应用了苏联先进的快速卸货工作法，在四月初把一艘轮船停泊港口的时间缩短了二十六小时。
    罗马尼亚工人也在以生产竞赛迎接“五一”劳动节。斯大林城“苏罗拖拉机工厂”七日举行生产会议，决定在第一季生产巨大成就的基础上，开展迎接“五一”节生产竞赛运动。该厂在第一季中，有百分之九十一以上的工人都参加了社会主义竞赛，而且还提出了四百一十三项关于技术和劳动组织的合理化建议。结果该厂第一季生产计划完成了百分之一百二十，劳动生产率超过计划百分之十。为了扩大第一季生产成果和庆祝全世界劳动人民的节日，该厂的生产会议保证要在四月三十日就开始生产五月十二日的定额；并在四月份超计划提高生产效率百分之七，减低生产成本百分之二。
