Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 17th: The twenty-fifth group of 511 refugees, unreasonably deported from Malaya by the British colonial authorities, arrived in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 16th. Wu Feng, Deputy Director of the Production Relief Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Chen Jingzhen, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Repatriated Refugee Processing Committee, went to the pier to welcome and express their sympathy.

This group of refugees was detained in concentration camps in Ipoh, Singapore, Klang, Johor, Malacca, and other places before returning to China. Most of them were elderly, weak, women, and children who suffered humiliation and abuse from the British imperialists in the concentration camps. As soon as they set foot on the soil of their motherland, they received the cordial care and attention of the people of the motherland.

    马来亚难侨又一批被迫返国
    【新华社广州十七日电】被马来亚英国殖民当局无理驱逐回国的第二十五批难侨五百一十一人，已在十六日下午到达广州。中央人民政府华侨事务委员会生产救济司副司长吴风、归国难侨处理委员会广州办事处副处长陈经镇都曾往码头欢迎和慰问。
    这批难侨在归国前曾被拘禁在怡保、星洲、巴生、柔佛、麻六甲等地的集中营，大部分为老弱妇孺，在集中营受尽了英帝国主义者的侮辱和虐待。他们一踏上祖国的土地，就受到祖国人民的亲切关怀和照顾。
