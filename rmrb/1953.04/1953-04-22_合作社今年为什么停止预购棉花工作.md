Why Cooperatives Have Stopped Pre-Purchasing Cotton This Year
		Ma Jianwen

The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has issued instructions to cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas to stop pre-purchasing cotton in 1953. This measure is in line with the country's current economic construction situation and is also conducive to improving the business operations of the cooperatives.

Since the spring of 1951, cooperatives across the country, entrusted by the state, have been engaging in the work of signing cotton pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas. At that time, the national economy was in the early stages of recovery, and cotton production, as an important industrial raw material and a necessary commodity for the lives of the vast majority of people, could not meet actual needs. At that time, state-owned textile companies, cooperatives, and private merchants often competed to purchase cotton on the market, causing fluctuations in cotton prices, and speculative merchants took the opportunity to hoard and speculate, which fueled the psychology of many cotton farmers to wait for higher prices. This situation seriously affected the state's cotton procurement plan, which could not be completed on time, and affected the production of yarn mills. In order to help the state control industrial raw materials and safeguard the interests of cotton farmers, cooperatives widely carried out the work of signing pre-purchase cotton contracts with cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas. The facts of the past two years have proved that signing pre-purchase cotton contracts has played a positive role in relieving cotton farmers' concerns about production and sales, strengthening the ties between cooperatives and their members, expanding cotton acreage, increasing cotton yield per unit area, and helping the state control industrial raw materials.

However, the pre-purchase contract system is a way for the state to purchase agricultural and sideline products through cooperatives. It is adapted to the country's economic situation and must serve the country's economic plan. In the past two years, thanks to a series of measures taken by the state that are beneficial to cotton farmers, the production, purchase, and demand of cotton have undergone fundamental changes, and the necessity of the pre-purchase contract system has been relatively reduced.

First of all, one of the main purposes of signing pre-purchase cotton contracts is to stabilize the production sentiment of cotton farmers and help them solve difficulties in production, in order to expand cotton planting area and increase cotton production. Over the past three years, all cotton purchasing departments have resolutely implemented the cotton-grain price parity policy and the "premium price for premium cotton" policy, ensuring the interests of cotton farmers. Cotton farmers are deeply convinced of the cotton price policy. On the other hand, the area of cotton fields and the output of cotton throughout the country have expanded and increased rapidly in recent years. Cotton production can already meet the needs of the national textile industry. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to expand cotton fields through pre-purchase contracts.

Secondly, another main purpose of carrying out pre-purchase cotton contracts is to control the free cotton market through the signing of contracts, so as to facilitate the state's control of industrial raw materials and close the link between industrial and agricultural production. Since cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas across the country implemented the unified method of purchasing cotton from farmers in 1952, this problem has been basically resolved. In addition, the operating strength of the cooperatives has grown increasingly strong, and it is fully possible for the cooperatives to control all the industrial cotton and civilian cotton needed by the state. Last year, cotton farmers had the reflection that "whether or not to sign a pre-purchase contract, the cotton must be sold to the cooperative anyway." Judging from the situation of cotton purchases in the months from September to December 1952, the mentality of cotton farmers "waiting for higher prices" has gradually been eliminated. Therefore, pre-purchase cotton contracts have lost the necessity of continuing to exist.

Third, in the past two years, cooperatives have provided materials to cotton farmers with production difficulties as "pre-purchase deposits" when signing pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers, which has played a great role in helping cotton farmers solve production difficulties and has been welcomed by cotton farmers. In the past two years, among the materials sold on credit to cotton farmers under the pre-purchase of cotton, fertilizers accounted for about 50% to 70% of the total value of prepaid materials. However, the past method of selling fertilizers on credit often caused complicated accounting procedures, which could not be settled in time, affecting the capital turnover of the cooperatives and the timely supply of fertilizers. This year, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has decided not to handle the business of selling fertilizers on credit, but instead to have the People's Bank of China uniformly provide loans to farmers who have real difficulties in purchasing fertilizers. This method can still solve the production difficulties of cotton farmers. As a result of the preferential treatment given to cotton farmers by the state in cotton price policies and agricultural taxes in the past three years and their efforts to increase yield per unit area, the income of cotton farmers in general cotton-producing areas has increased significantly, and the strength of production investment has also gradually expanded. Therefore, the method of selling materials on credit to cotton farmers as "pre-purchase deposits" through pre-purchase contracts can no longer adapt to the cooperatives' improvement of business operations, acceleration of capital turnover, and continued satisfaction of farmers' production needs.

However, it must be recognized that after the pre-purchase of cotton is stopped, cooperatives in cotton-producing areas should conduct more in-depth and meticulous publicity, education, and business organization work when purchasing cotton in the fall, and the relationship between cooperatives and their members must be closer. The idea that stopping pre-purchase of cotton can relax the education and organizational work on cotton production and purchase for cotton farmers is wrong. Qingming has passed, and various places will soon begin planting cotton. In order to dispel cotton farmers' doubts about the cooperative's cessation of pre-purchase of cotton and better complete the task of purchasing new cotton in the fall, cooperative cadres in various cotton-producing areas must do the following:

First, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and in conjunction with the central task of spring plowing production, conduct in-depth and universal publicity and education for cotton farmers to stabilize their production sentiment. When conducting publicity for cotton farmers, they should first explain the reason for stopping the pre-purchase of cotton, stating that although the cooperative will not conduct pre-purchase this year, after the new cotton is on the market, the cooperative will still purchase it in accordance with the cotton-grain price parity policy of the People's Government. When publicizing the cessation of pre-purchase, it should be combined with the explanation of the cotton-grain price parity policy and the tax collection policy for cotton in 1953. According to local conditions, the method of calculating detailed accounts and comparisons can be used to show that planting cotton this year still has appropriate benefits. Taking the lowest price ratio of 0.87 intermediate-grade fine-lint cotton to 6.62 pounds of rice, it still exceeds the pre-war level. In terms of tax collection on cotton, in 1952, the People's Government implemented the method of levying additional taxes on cotton fields in the major cotton-producing areas across the country. In North China, for example, about 8 to 9 pounds of millet were added per standard mu of cotton field. This year, the tax will be levied according to the 1951 method. Under normal circumstances, the public grain burden on cotton fields will be reduced by about 10% to 15%. Therefore, although the price of cotton in 1953 was slightly lower than in 1952, the burden of public grain on cotton fields in major cotton-producing areas was also relatively reduced. This is also beneficial to cotton farmers. Of course, attention should also be paid to preventing the tendency to blindly expand cotton fields in publicity.

Second, we should strengthen the planning and organization of cooperatives in purchasing cotton, and do a good job in preparing for the purchase of new cotton. At present, some cooperative cadres have the mistaken understanding that "without pre-purchase, we cannot grasp the purchase" or "without pre-purchase, we cannot plan and organize the purchase." This should be overcome. This year, the cooperative will not conduct pre-purchase, but the planning and organization of cotton purchase can still be strengthened and must be strengthened. Cooperatives at all levels should work with agricultural departments to carefully investigate the cotton planting area and cotton production, study the varieties, specifications, time, and habits of the commodities needed by cotton farmers after selling cotton last year, and formulate purchase plans and material supply plans based on the results of the survey. At the same time, they should also organize processing forces and train cotton inspectors and accountants in accordance with the purchase plan, and strive to do a good job in preparing for this year's cotton purchase.

    合作社今年为什么停止预购棉花工作
    马建文
    全国合作总社已对全国各产棉区合作社发出关于一九五三年停止预购棉花工作的指示。这种措施是适合国家当前的经济建设情况，同时也是有利于合作社改进业务经营的。
    自一九五一年春，全国各地合作社接受国家委托，在产棉区开展了与棉农订立预购棉花合同的工作。当时国家经济正处于恢复阶段的初期，作为重要工业原料和广大人民生活必需物资之一的棉花生产，还不能满足实际的需要。当时国营花纱布公司、合作社、私商三种经济力量，往往在市场上争购棉花，以致引起棉花价格波动，投机商人乘机囤积居奇，这就助长了许多棉农待价惜售的心理。这种情况曾严重地影响了国家收棉计划不能按时完成，影响了纱厂的生产。为了帮助国家掌握工业原料，维护棉农的利益，合作社在产棉区广泛开展了与棉农签订预购棉花合同工作。两年来的事实证明，通过签订预购棉花合同，对解除棉农在生产和销售棉花上的顾虑，密切合作社与社员群众的联系，扩大棉田面积，提高棉花单位面积产量和替国家掌握工业原料方面，都起了积极的作用。
    但是，预购合同制是国家通过合作社收购农产品和副业产品的一种方式，它是与国家的经济情况相适应，而且必然要为国家经济计划服务的。近两年来，由于国家采取了一系列有利于棉农的措施，已使棉花的生产、收购和需要情况起了基本变化，预购合同制的必要性已相对减少了。
    首先，签订预购棉花合同的主要目的之一，是通过签订合同安定棉农生产情绪，帮助他们解决生产上的困难，以扩大棉田种植面积，增加棉花生产。三年来，由于各收购棉花部门坚决地贯彻了棉粮比价政策和“优棉优价”政策，保证了棉农的利益，棉农对棉价政策已深信不疑。另一方面，全国棉田面积和棉花的产量，几年来已有迅速的扩大和增加。棉花产量已能满足全国纺织工业的需要。因此，通过预购合同来扩大棉田的作法已不必要了。
    其次，开展预购棉花合同的另一主要目的，是通过签订合同来控制棉花自由市场，以便于国家掌握工业原料，密切工业和农业生产之间的联系。自一九五二年全国各产棉区合作社实行了统一向农民收购棉花的办法以后，这个问题基本上已解决了。加以合作社经营力量日益壮大，国家需要的工业用棉和民用絮棉已有充分可能通过合作社全部掌握起来。去年棉农已有“订不订预购合同，反正棉花要卖给合作社”的反映。从一九五二年九月到十二月各月份收购棉花的情况来看，棉农“待价惜售”的思想已逐步消除。因此，预购棉花合同已经失去了继续存在的必要。
    第三，两年来合作社在与棉农签订预购合同时，曾赊销物资给生产上有困难的棉农，作为“预购定金”，对帮助棉农解决生产困难起了很大作用，并受到棉农的欢迎。过去两年来预购棉花赊销给棉农的物资中，肥料一项约占预付物资总值的百分之五十到七十。但过去赊销肥料的办法，往往因账目手续繁杂，不能及时清结，影响合作社的资金周转和肥料的及时供应。今年全国合作总社已决定不再办理赊销肥料业务，而改由人民银行统一贷款给购买肥料确有困难的农民，这种办法仍然可以解决棉农生产上的困难。由于近三年来国家在棉价政策和农业税收上给予棉农的优惠和他们努力提高单位面积产量的结果，一般产棉区棉农的收入都在显著增加，生产投资的力量亦逐渐扩大。因此，通过预购合同赊销给棉农物资作为“预购定金”的办法，已不能适应合作社改进业务经营，加速资金周转和继续满足农民生产上的要求了。
    但是必须认识：预购棉花工作停止以后，产棉区合作社在秋后收棉时应该进行更加深入、细致的宣传教育和业务组织工作，合作社与社员群众之间的关系必须更加密切起来。那种认为停止预购棉花即可放松对棉农进行棉花生产与收购方面的教育工作和组织工作的想法是错误的。目前清明已过，各地即将开始种棉。为了解除棉农对合作社停止预购棉花的疑虑，更好地完成秋后收购新棉的任务，各产棉区合作社干部必须做好下面几点工作。
    第一，在党、人民政府领导下，结合春耕生产这一中心工作，深入普遍地向棉农进行宣传教育，以稳定棉农的生产情绪。在向棉农进行宣传时，首先应讲清停止预购棉花的道理，说明合作社今年虽不进行预购，但新花上市后，合作社仍然要依照人民政府的棉粮比价政策进行收购。在宣传停止预购时，并应与解释一九五三年的棉粮比价政策和赋棉征收政策相结合。可以根据当地情况，用算细账和对比等方法，说明今年植棉仍然有适当利益。以最低比价八分之七中级细绒皮棉换六斤十二两米来说，亦还超过战前水平。在赋棉征收方面，一九五二年人民政府在全国各主要棉区曾施行棉田加征的办法，以华北区来说，每棉田标准亩即约加征小米八斤至九斤左右。今年改按一九五一年征收办法计征，棉田公粮负担在一般情况下，约降低百分之十到十五左右。因此，一九五三年棉花价格虽较一九五二年降低了一些，但各主要棉区的棉田公粮负担亦相对降低。这也是对棉农有利的。当然，在宣传中还要注意防止发生盲目扩大棉田的偏向。
    第二，应加强合作社收购棉花的计划性、组织性，做好收购新棉的准备工作。目前有些合作社干部存在着“不预购不能掌握收购”或“不预购就不能有计划组织收购”的错误认识，这是应该加以克服的。今年合作社不进行预购，棉花收购的计划性和组织性仍是可以加强也是必须加强的。各级合作社应该协同农业部门认真调查棉田播种面积和棉花生产情况，研究去年棉农出售棉花后需要商品的品种、规格、时间和习惯，并根据调查的结果，制订收购计划和物资供应计划。同时并应根据收购计划，组织加工力量，训练棉花检验人员和会计人员，为做好今年的收棉准备工作而努力。
