    Eliminate the enemy wherever they attack!
    Xue Ye, Tian Guoqing, Tian Zhuang
    On the snow-covered Korean battlefield, the volunteer soldiers, under the slogan of "Building tunnels is victory," are fighting against the severe cold and against nature. With astonishing labor, they are building the "Underground Great Wall" and, together with the heroic People's Army, are preparing to deliver a crushing blow to any military adventure by Eisenhower in Korea.
    
    I
    
    In a certain area of the Korean front, the majestic songs of the volunteer soldiers resound throughout the mountains and fields:
    
    "Thousands of cannons are set up,
    Thousands of tanks are lined up...
    If Eisenhower dares to invade,
    We will resolutely eliminate him at sea..."
    
    The soldiers are carrying out tunnel operations intensely amidst the singing. The ground is frozen like iron, and the stones are numerous and hard. When the pickaxe falls, sometimes not even a small piece of stone can be chipped off. In one platoon of a certain unit, all twenty-five soldiers had their hands injured by the vibrations. The blood of soldier Huang Changding's arm was broken and bleeding, and his blood stained half of his arm red, but he endured the pain and said to everyone, "Comrades, the stones are hard, but our determination is harder. We are determined to fight the stones."
    
    Qiao Sheng, the deputy of the third squad of the third company, had his hand injured by a soldier's misdirected hammer while digging a tunnel. The blood stained a meter-long drill red. He immediately ran to the shelter, bandaged it with gauze, and in less than five minutes, he came back scrambling to hold the drill again, and no one could stop him. It wasn't until his wrist swelled up that the instructor ordered him to go back to rest, and then he went down the mountain. But in less than three hours, he ran back again. The instructor asked him why he didn't obey the order, but he said with good reason, "On the battlefield, minor injuries are not considered disobedience if you don't leave the line of fire. The comrades are all working, I am the platoon deputy, and a Communist Party member, can I rest peacefully?"
    
    A month later, this unit was transferred to the front line again. They not only dug tunnels, but also actively studied. The study group leader read the topic: "Why do we say that our current task is the most important and glorious task?" So everyone discussed it enthusiastically. Some said that American imperialism is a wolf with ambition, and it wants to take our victory and our plate. Some said that the enemy intends to cut off our transport lines. Some said that it wants to undermine our country's economic construction. Some said that it wants to take a chance and attack to find a bargain to ease the contradiction between it and its lackey countries...
    
    One day, the sky was clear with not even a cloud in the sky. The soldiers were working hard when suddenly four enemy planes flew over. The enemy planes were about to dive when our "Silver Swallows" met them head-on and drove them away. The soldiers were so happy that they jumped straight up. So, the pickaxes were raised higher and fell faster.

    In another place, volunteer soldiers are also conquering the severe cold of minus thirty-five degrees on the snow-covered high mountains, and are launching a vigorous movement to dig fortifications.
    
    The gongs and drums on Dongshan Head are ringing, and that is the fifth company sending a red flag to the third squad. The third squad has excellent achievements in the whole camp. They have repeatedly asked the superiors to give them the task of digging a tunnel. Their request was finally approved, and everyone was in a very high mood. Deputy squad leader and probationary party member Liu Wenchao said, "Let the Party test me during this tunnel digging!" Soldier Chen Qi'ai usually did not do well in cultural studies. This time, he also expressed that he must study culture well, and guaranteed to strive for meritorious service.
    
    During the half-month of building fortifications, Chen Qi'ai's performance was indeed very good and was praised. Liu Wenchao came to work even when he was not supposed to, unwilling to rest. Soldier Ye Xinheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, was very capable at work, and took the lead in carrying out recreational activities, singing for a while, telling clapper tales for a while, making the tunnel very lively. They worked so happily and selflessly, building "homes of positions" in the mountains and forests covered with deep snow. They also wrote a song on red paper and pasted it in the tunnel: "Steel positions are on the hilltop, the heroic will is stronger than steel, heroes guard the heroic positions, the underground Great Wall defends the coast." Digging tunnels is an arduous project, especially in the severe cold weather of minus thirty or forty degrees. The mountain surface is frozen soil, and under the frozen soil is a rocky cliff. Here, there are no tunnel boring machines, nor a lot of explosives. The volunteer soldiers can only use their labor and wisdom to overcome difficulties and complete the task.
    
    The soldiers of the Third Battalion of a certain unit adopted the "three-eight system" in the tunnel operations of a certain high ground, and fought against stubborn rocks with hammers and picks day and night. Eight-pound hammers were broken in a few days; a meter and two-long drill was only one meter long after three days; hammer and pick handles had to be replaced almost every day. The first problem facing everyone was the lack of tools. But what does this matter! The soldiers have proposed: "I can blacksmith," "I have been a carpenter,"... so "ironwork group" and "carpentry group" were immediately formed. The ironwork group needed coal, everyone said: "We have coal for fire." The carpentry group needed wood, so everyone went to the gullies more than ten miles away to carry wood..., soon, new tools were continuously transported from the "factory" to the mountain.
    
    Digging only with hammers and picks was too slow to progress. Using explosives to blast, explosives were not enough. Burning stones with fire also took three or four hours at a time. How to make the project progress faster became the second problem facing everyone.
    
    Wang Jinxi, the company commander of the Eleventh Company and special-class hero, thought to himself that there must be a large number of explosives. He suddenly thought that there were still many timed bombs dropped by enemy planes lying on the nearby mountains. He decided to use a small amount of explosives to blow up these monsters and take out the explosives. So he took two soldiers to the hillside and found a thousand-pound timed bomb, but after three explosions, he didn't blast a small crack, only blasted a pit in the belly of the huge monster. He failed the first day. Company Commander Wang went back and thought for a night, and finally, the next day, he blasted an opening in the belly of the monster and took out more than three hundred pounds of explosives, not counting those that flew away. Everyone calculated that if they could turn the dozen or so monsters of all sizes nearby into two or three thousand pounds of explosives, they could reduce at least ten thousand man-hours, then they would be able to complete the tunnel work of the whole camp ahead of schedule. Company Commander Wang smiled and said, "Eisenhower has reduced our burden!"
    
    The volunteer heroes are overcoming all difficulties in this way, and are executing their glorious tasks with full confidence. A volunteer soldier wrote the following oath in his notebook:
    
    "Dear Chairman Mao: In order to defend peace and defend the construction of the motherland, we have turned the mountains of Korea into tunnels and the coasts of Korea into copper walls and iron walls. Wherever the enemy attacks, we will eliminate them there!"

### 敌人从哪里进攻，就把它消灭在哪里！

    敌人从哪里进攻，就把它消灭在哪里！
    雪野  田国庆  田庄
    在冰天雪地的朝鲜战场上，志愿军战士们在“筑好坑道就是胜利”的口号下，正和严寒搏斗，和自然搏斗，用惊人的劳动建筑着“地下长城”，和英雄的人民军一起，准备给艾森豪威尔在朝鲜的任何军事冒险以粉碎性的打击。
    一
    在朝鲜前线某地，满山遍野响起志愿军战士们雄壮的歌声：
    “千百门大炮架起来，
    千百辆坦克排起来……
    艾森豪威尔胆敢来进犯，
    就坚决消灭他在海上……”
    战士们在歌声中紧张地进行着坑道作业；地冻得像铁板一样，石头又多又硬，镐头落下去，有时连一片小石头也啃不下来。某部的一个排全排二十五个人，没有一个人的手不被震坏的。战士黄长定的手臂被震破流了血，鲜血染红了半个手臂，他却忍着痛对大家说：“同志们，石头硬没有我们的决心硬，我们坚决和石头作斗争。”
    三连三排副乔盛在打坑道时被一个战士失锤打坏了手，鲜血染红了一公尺长的钎子，他立刻跑到掩蔽部用纱布包上，不到五分钟，又回来抢着要扶钎子，拦也拦不住。直到他手腕肿起来了，指导员命令他回去休息，他才下山去。可是不到三个钟头，他又跑回来了。指导员问他为什么不服从命令，他却满有理由地说：“在战场上轻伤不下火线不算违抗命令。同志们都在工作，我是排副，又是一个共产党员，我能安心躺着吗？”
    一个月后，这支部队又被调到前沿去了。他们一面打坑道，还一面积极地学习。学习组长念着题目：“为什么说目前我们的任务是最重要的最光荣的任务？”于是大家就热烈地讨论起来。有的说，美帝国主义是个野心狼，它想把我们的胜利果实连盘子端。有的说，敌人打算切断我们的运输线。有的说，它想破坏我们祖国的经济建设。有的说，它想冒险进攻找便宜，缓和一下它和它的喽囉国家中间的矛盾……
    一天，天晴得连一片云彩也没有。战士们正在紧张地工作着，突然飞来四架敌机，敌机飞到他们头上刚要俯冲，就被我们的“银燕儿”迎头打跑了。战士们乐得直跳。于是，镐头也举得更高，落得更快了。
    二
    在另一个地方，志愿军战士们也在积雪的高山上，征服零下三十五度的严寒，掀起热火朝天的挖工事运动。
    东山头上锣鼓响起了，那是五连给三班送红旗的。三班在全营里是成绩优良的。他们三番两次地要求上级给他们打通一条坑道的任务。他们的要求终于被批准了，大家的情绪非常高。副班长、候补党员刘文潮说：“在这次打坑道时，让党考验我吧！”战士陈启爱平常学习文化成绩不好，这次他也表示一定要把文化学好，并保证争取立功。
    在筑工事的半个月期间，陈启爱果然成绩很好，受到了表扬。刘文潮是不该上班也来上班，不愿休息。战士叶新恒是个青年团员，做起工来挺能干，而且带头展开文娱活动，一会儿唱歌，一会儿说快板，把坑道里搞得热闹极了。他们这样愉快地忘我地劳动着，在覆盖着深雪的山林中筑起“阵地之家”。他们还用红纸写着一首歌贴在坑道里：“钢铁阵地在山岗，英雄意志比钢强，英雄阵地英雄守，地下长城卫海防。”三挖坑道是一种艰巨工程，尤其是在零下三、四十度的严寒天气里，山面上是冻土，冻土下是石崖。这里既无穿山机，又无很多的炸药，志愿军战士们只有运用自己的劳动和智慧，去克服困难，完成任务。
    某部三营的战士们，在某高地的坑道作业中，采取了“三八制”，不分昼夜地一锤一镐地向顽石作斗争。八磅重的铁锤几天就打碎了；一公尺二长的钎子三天后就只剩下一公尺了；铁锤、十字镐把子几乎每天要换一根新的。摆在大家面前的第一个问题是工具不够用。可是这算得什么呢！战士们纷纷提出：“我会打铁”，“我当过木匠”，……于是“铁工组”和“木工组”马上就组成了。铁工组需要煤，大家说：“我们有烤火煤。”木工组需要木料，大家就往十多里外的山沟里去扛木料……，不久，新的工具就源源不绝地从“工厂”里运往山头去了。
    光是一锤一镐地挖，工程进展得太慢了。用炸药炸，炸药又不够用。用火烧石头，烧一次也要三、四个钟头。如何使工程进展得快，就成了摆在大家面前的第二个问题。
    十一连连长、特等功臣王进喜心里想，必须有大量的炸药才行。他忽然想到附近山地上还躺着不少的敌机投下的定时弹。他决定用少许炸药把这些怪物爆破，取出炸药来。于是他就带了两个战士一起到了山坡上，找到一个一千磅重的定时弹，可是连爆三次，也没爆破一个小裂口，仅仅把那个庞大的怪物的肚子炸了个坑。头一天失败了。王连长回去想了一夜，第二天终于把这个怪物的肚子爆裂了口，从里面取出了三百多斤炸药，飞了的还不算。大家计算了一下，如果能把附近大大小小的十几个怪物变成二三千斤炸药，至少能减轻一万个人工，那就准可使全营的坑道作业提前完成。王连长笑着说：“这是艾森豪威尔给我们减轻了担子！”
    志愿军的英雄们就是这样克服着一切困难，信心百倍地执行着他们的光荣任务。一个志愿军战士的笔记本上写着这样的誓言：
        “亲爱的毛主席：为了保卫和平、保卫祖国建设，我们已把朝鲜的山变成了坑道，把朝鲜的海岸变成了铜墙铁壁。敌人从哪里进攻，我们就把它消灭在哪里！”
