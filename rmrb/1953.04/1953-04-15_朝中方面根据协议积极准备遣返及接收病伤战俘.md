Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 14th: According to the agreement reached, enemy sick and wounded prisoners of war to be repatriated by the Korean-Chinese side will depart from their concentration points in batches starting from the 14th, and will arrive in Kaesong successively from the 16th. After rest and medical care, they will cross the Panmunjom exchange zone between the two sides on the 20th, becoming the lucky, first repatriated prisoners of war in this war. The first batch of sick and wounded prisoners of war to be repatriated by our side departed from Tianmo at 6:00 am on the 14th in 20 vehicles and is expected to arrive in Kaesong on the 16th. Another two batches, totaling 45 vehicles, departed from Manpo and Bitton respectively at 6:00 am this morning and are expected to arrive in Kaesong on the 17th. These convoys are moving rapidly southward along the highway, which has been constantly bombed by the US side but remains unimpeded. Each vehicle has a conspicuous red cloth of one square meter covering the front, according to the agreement between the two sides, and a red flag of one square meter is hung on the vehicle. Each campsite along the way also has clear Red Cross signs, four meters long and eighty centimeters wide, according to the agreement. Our side has also marked the location of the highway and intermediate campsites used by these convoys in detail on the map and handed them over to the US side in advance. At the same time, in the ruins of Kaesong caused by the indiscriminate bombing of the US aircraft, the Korean-Chinese side has chosen the most solid remaining public buildings and is actively making thorough preparations for the repatriation and reception of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Reporters today visited several huge temporary hospitals. The hospital for non-Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war is located in the tall building of the original museum, where the interior of the building is being repaired. The hospital for Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war is located in the original Goryeo Union, where clean beds have been arranged. In addition, medical staff and medical equipment have been prepared, and food has also been transported. Those who are to be repatriated will be bathed after arriving in Kaesong, and their clothing will be disinfected for the last time, and then given supplementary treatment. They will be placed in different wards according to their illnesses, where they will receive good rest and food. At the same time, the Korean-Chinese side is also actively preparing to receive its own repatriated sick and wounded prisoners of war.
