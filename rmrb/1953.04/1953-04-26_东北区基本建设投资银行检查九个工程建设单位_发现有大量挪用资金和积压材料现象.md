The basic construction task in the Northeast region this year is very heavy, with the engineering workload increasing by 84% compared to last year. In order to implement the economic accounting system in this year's basic construction projects and meet the requirements of "good, fast, and economical," the Northeast District Basic Construction Investment Bank has strengthened its supervision of basic construction appropriations and on-site inspections. According to the bank's materials from the first quarter of this year, after inspecting nine engineering construction units, it was proven that most engineering construction units misappropriated advance appropriations for basic construction. For example, the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration misappropriated 20 billion yuan of basic construction advance payments to repay the People's Bank of China. The Dalian Chemical Factory repaid the People's Bank of China 6 billion yuan and also used 700 million yuan for production loans. The Northeast Coal Mining Administration misappropriated basic construction funds to cover 25.6 billion yuan for last year's over-schedule projects and 25.3 billion yuan for material price differences, and purchased more than 110 billion yuan of materials stockpiled last year. Some engineering construction units did not make purchases after pre-acquiring material purchase funds, resulting in long-term stockpiling of funds. Qingchengzi Mine stockpiled 7.4 billion yuan in material purchase funds, and the Huatonggou Mine's purchasing group stockpiled 2.6 billion yuan for a long time. The Northeast Coal Mining Administration advanced more than 80 billion yuan for equipment purchase funds to its affiliated mines, which have not been recovered for a long time, causing the administration's capital turnover to be difficult.

The stockpiling of materials purchased by various engineering units this year is also very serious (referring to materials not needed in 1953). The Fushun Coal Mining Administration stockpiled materials with a depreciated value of 13.4 billion yuan, the Benxi Coal Mining Administration stockpiled materials with a depreciated value of 30 billion yuan, and the Northeast Machine Factory No. 11 stockpiled materials with a depreciated value of 1.5 billion yuan. The Dalian Railway Factory stockpiled 367 tons of lime and 1.66 million red bricks; the Jinzhou Textile Factory stockpiled 147 tons of cement and 43 cubic meters of wood.

The main reasons for the misappropriation of funds and stockpiling of materials are: the annual basic construction plans and engineering projects of various engineering construction units in the Northeast have not been determined for a long time, and the working capital of various contracting enterprises has not been allocated; the financial management of some engineering units is unsound, and the use of funds for material reserves by construction units is very urgent and chaotic; the supervision of the Basic Construction Investment Bank is not strict enough, resulting in the unreasonable use of basic construction funds. In order to change this situation, the Northeast District Basic Construction Investment Bank will strengthen the strict review of appropriations and material purchases in the second quarter to avoid the stockpiling and waste of funds and materials.

    东北区基本建设投资银行检查九个工程建设单位
    发现有大量挪用资金和积压材料现象
    今年东北全区基本建设任务很重，工程工作量较去年增加百分之八十四。为了使今年基本建设工程贯彻经济核算制，合乎“好、快、省”的要求，东北区基本建设投资银行加强了基本建设拨款监督和现场检查工作。根据该行今年第一季度检查九个工程建设单位的材料后证明：各工程建设单位大都挪用基本建设的预付拨款。如东北有色金属工业管理局挪用了基本建设预付款二百亿元偿付给中国人民银行。大连化学工厂偿还中国人民银行六十亿元，还用七亿元作了生产贷款。东北煤矿管理局挪用基本建设款垫付去年该矿超进度工程二百五十六亿元，垫付材料差价二百五十三亿元，并购买去年积压材料一千一百余亿元。有些工程建设单位在预收购料款后未进行采购，长期积压资金。青城子矿积压购料款七十四亿元，华铜沟矿的采购组手里长期积压二十六亿元。东北煤矿管理局给所属各矿垫付的采购器材款八百多亿元，长期未收回，造成该局资金周转困难。
    各工程单位今年所采购的材料积压也很严重（指一九五三年用不着的材料）。抚顺煤矿管理局积压材料折价一百三十四亿元，本溪煤矿管理局积压材料折价三百亿元，东北机器十一厂积压材料折款十五亿元。大连铁路工厂积压白灰三百六十七吨，红砖一百六十六万个；锦州纺织厂积压水泥一百四十七吨，木材四十三立方公尺。
    造成挪用资金、材料积压的主要原因是：东北各工程建设单位的年度基本建设计划、工程项目均迟迟未确定，各包工企业的流动资金未下达；有些工程单位的财务管理工作不健全，建设单位储备材料用款很急很乱；基本建设投资银行监督不够严格，因而造成了基本建设资金使用的不合理。东北区基本建设投资银行为改变这种状况，在第二季度要加强拨款和采购材料的严格审核，以避免资金和材料的积压和浪费。
