Tsering Drolma, a representative of the Tibetan delegation, broadcast her impressions of attending the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna last December to the Tibetan monks and laypeople via the Central People's Broadcasting Station on April 8th.

Tsering Drolma said, "Coming to the capital with the Tibetan delegation to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and to visit and study in various parts of the country is the greatest happiness of my life. I am even more fortunate to be able to attend the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna as one of the Chinese representatives."

Tsering Drolma said, "At this conference, I personally witnessed the strength of the world peace and democracy camp. More than a thousand delegates expressed the peaceful voice of hundreds of millions of people around the world. I saw the significant role our China plays in the struggle for world peace. Peace representatives from various countries were very willing to listen to the reports of the Chinese representatives, and people were eager to shake hands and embrace Head of Delegation Soong Ching Ling."

Tsering Drolma said, "After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, imperialists spread many inexplicable rumors in various countries. In Vienna, many foreigners heard that I was a relative of the Dalai Lama and asked, 'Is the Dalai Lama the same as before?' They knew nothing about the situation in Tibet. I told them at the time that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni were very united, and their inherent status and powers had not been lost at all. They are respected by the people as before. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been of great help to our Tibetan people, and the unity between the Tibetan and other fraternal ethnic groups of China is very consolidated."

Tsering Drolma described her impression of Vienna, saying, "The welcome of the Viennese people to our Chinese representatives is really hard to describe in words. As soon as we got off the train, a tide of people ran to offer us flowers. They all said: The Chinese people are the most peace-loving people and the bravest heroes in the world. But the people of Vienna are still living in misery. Everywhere there are traces of destruction from World War II. In the areas occupied by the United States, Britain, and France, the destroyed tall buildings have not been repaired. Therefore, people who come to Vienna are even more disgusted with war. We Buddhists are extremely opposed to the killing of human beings. But today, there are still war lovers in the world who provoke and create the massacre of human beings. At the World Peace Congress, representatives of people from all countries unanimously rebuked these insane people."

Tsering Drolma enthusiastically introduced her impressions of passing through the Soviet Union and visiting the area near Moscow. She said, "I truly realized that the Soviet Union is a great country, and the Soviet people are truly happy people. I saw men, women, old and young in the Soviet Union dressed very beautifully. Department stores were crowded with people, and it was as lively as a festival every day. In Moscow, we were invited to visit the Soviet National Peace Congress. There were so many people in the venue, and their clothes were different, representing delegates from various ethnic regions. The Soviet Union, like our China, is also a multi-ethnic country, and all ethnic groups are equal and closely united like one person. What particularly caught my attention was that there were also religious representatives in the venue, and they, like other representatives, expressed their opinions on the world peace movement. In the past, I heard that there was no freedom of religion in the Soviet Union and that religion had been eliminated. Now the facts I have seen with my own eyes have shattered the imperialists' lies."

Tsering Drolma said, "When the Soviet people heard that I was from Tibet and was the Dalai Lama's sister, they were extraordinarily warm to me and took special care of me. People scrambled to take pictures with me, and many women were very curious about my clothes, looking at them again and again. I cannot forget those very innocent children who also held small notebooks and asked me to sign them as a souvenir."

Tsering Drolma finally said, "Returning from Vienna, I felt even more the strength of the world peace and democracy camp, the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, and realized the decisive role our country plays in safeguarding world peace.
The 'Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet' and Chairman Mao's recent instructions on Tibetan work have pointed out a bright path towards happiness and prosperity for the monks and laypeople of Tibet. We Tibetan people have begun to develop our new life under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and with the help of the Tibetan Military Region troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Tibetan people, like all ethnic groups in the motherland, are forever peace-loving, and for the cause of peace, we are willing to contribute all our strength." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 西藏致敬团代表泽仁卓玛向西藏人民广播出席世界人民和平大会的观感

    西藏致敬团代表泽仁卓玛向西藏人民广播出席世界人民和平大会的观感
    西藏致敬团代表泽仁卓玛四月八日在中央人民广播电台，向西藏僧俗人民广播她去年十二月到维也纳参加世界人民和平大会的观感。
    泽仁卓玛说：“我随西藏致敬团到首都来向毛主席致敬，又到全国各地参观学习，就是一生中最大的幸福了，我更幸运的是能作为中国代表之一到维也纳出席世界人民和平大会。”
    泽仁卓玛说：“在这次会上我亲眼看到世界和平民主阵营力量的强大，到会的一千多个代表，表达了全世界亿万人类的和平呼声。我看到了我们中国在争取世界和平运动中的重大作用，各国和平代表都十分愿听中国代表的报告，人们都争着和宋庆龄团长握手和拥抱。”
    泽仁卓玛说：“西藏和平解放以后，帝国主义在各国散布许多莫名其妙的谣言。在维也纳许多外国人听说我是达赖喇嘛的亲族，就问：‘达赖喇嘛和过去一样吗？’他们对西藏情况一无所知。我当时就告诉他们达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼团结得很好，他们的固有地位和职权一点都没有损失，他们和过去一样受到人民的尊敬。中国人民解放军对我们藏族人民的帮助很大，藏族和中国各兄弟民族的团结非常巩固。”
    泽仁卓玛讲述了对维也纳的印象说：“维也纳人民对我们中国代表的欢迎，实在难以用言语形容。我们一下火车，潮水一样的人群跑来向我们献花，他们都说：中国人民是最爱好和平的人民，是世界上最勇敢的英雄。但是维也纳的人民现在还生活在苦难中，那里到处都是第二次世界大战破坏的痕迹，在美、英、法国占领下的地区，被毁坏的高楼大厦还没有修复。因此，到维也纳的人都更加憎恶战争。我们信奉佛教的人，极反对人类间的残杀。但是今天世界上却还有战争的爱好者，挑拨和制造人类的屠杀。在世界和平大会上，各国人民代表都毫无例外地对这些发了疯的人予以申斥。”
    泽仁卓玛热情地介绍了自己路过苏联、并在莫斯科附近参观时的观感。她说：“我真正认识了苏联是一个伟大的国家，苏联人民是真正幸福的人。我在苏联看到的男女老幼都穿得很漂亮，百货公司挤满了人，天天像过节一样热闹。我们在莫斯科被邀去参观苏联全国和平大会。会场里那么多的人，他们的服装各不相同，是从各民族地区来的代表。苏联和我们中国一样，也是一个多民族的国家，各民族一律平等，亲密团结得像一个人。特别令我注意的是会场上还有宗教界的代表，他们和其他代表一样发表了对世界和平运动的意见。过去听说苏联没有信教自由，已经消灭了宗教，现在我亲眼见到的事实，已粉碎了帝国主义的鬼话了。”
    泽仁卓玛说：“苏联人民听说我是从西藏来的，而且又正是达赖喇嘛的姐姐，他们对我异常的亲热，照顾得特别周到。人们争着和我一同照像，有许多妇女对我的服装非常好奇，看了又看。我不能忘记那些很天真的孩子们，他们还拿着小本子请我在上面签名留作纪念。”
    泽仁卓玛最后说：“我从维也纳回来，更加感到世界和平民主阵营的强大，我们祖国的伟大可爱，认识到我们国家在保卫世界和平中的决定性作用。
  ‘和平解放西藏办法的协议’和毛主席最近对西藏工作的指示，给西藏僧俗人民指出了一条走向幸福繁荣的光明道路。我们西藏人民开始在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，和中国人民解放军西藏军区部队的帮助下发展自己的新生活，西藏人民和祖国各族人民一样，永远是爱和平的，为了和平事业，我们愿贡献出一切力量。”（新华社）
