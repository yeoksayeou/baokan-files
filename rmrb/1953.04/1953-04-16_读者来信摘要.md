Reader Letters Summary

    Over 1,600 Tons of Soybean Cake Payment Delayed for Over a Year
    Guo Huaying from the Northeast Grain Administration writes: The soybean cake originally sent from the Northeast Region Grain Company to the interior in December 1951 was received and managed by the China Native Produce Company. Later, with the approval of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, this business was transferred to the Grain Management Department of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in 1952. At that time, because the China Native Produce Company and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives had not yet completed the handover, the original Northeast Region Grain Company still shipped the soybean cake according to the China Native Produce Company's December plan. In December, the grain companies in various parts of Northeast China shipped a total of 1,627 tons of soybean cake to the native produce companies in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and other places in Zhejiang Province. Because the local native produce companies had received instructions from their superiors, they let the local cooperatives receive the goods. The cooperatives mistakenly believed that the cake had been allocated by the head office and reported the received quantity to the East China Region Federation of Cooperatives. The East China Region Federation of Cooperatives also believed that the cake had been allocated by the head office. It wasn't until the third quarter of 1952 when the Grain Management Department of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives sent someone to inspect the work in the East China Region that they discovered that this batch of soybean cake had not been allocated by the head office; however, the source of this batch of soybean cake was also unclear. In January 1953, the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Cooperatives transferred the soybean cake payment to the Grain Management Department of the head office for temporary storage, pending clarification of the issue. However, on the other hand, the original Northeast Region Grain Company had wanted to settle accounts with the China Native Produce Company, but the China Native Produce Company did not acknowledge receiving this batch of soybean cake. In short, the original Northeast Region Grain Company, the China Native Produce Company, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives did not coordinate well in their work, resulting in the accumulation of over 1,600 tons of soybean cake payment in the grassroots units for more than a year, and it has not yet been finally settled. It is hoped that the above three units will quickly investigate the cause of the backlog as a lesson for future work.
    Small Trees Growing on Machines Left in the Open
    Three workers from the Tangshan Power Plant write: The original Power Industry Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department is not properly managing a large number of machines, components, and accessories (estimated to be worth over 30 billion yuan) stored at the Tangshan Power Plant. Except for the generators and some components that have mat sheds for cover, most of the machines are thrown in the grass, exposed to wind, rain, and sun. Many have rusted and are unusable. Many workers have repeatedly raised this issue with the original Power Industry Management Bureau, but it has not been taken seriously by the bureau.
    Speaking of these machines, it's a long story. During the Japanese occupation in 1945, when the second power plant was to be built in Tangshan, large generators – turbine machines, cranes, boilers, cement mixers, and many other components and accessories were transported here. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang left these materials untouched on the grass. At the end of 1948, Tangshan was liberated, and the workers became the masters of the country. They were very concerned about these materials and hoped that they could be used in the country's large-scale construction in the future. The original Power Industry Management Bureau took over these materials and, although they instructed that no one was allowed to use them, they did not manage them well themselves. In 1949, these things were flooded, and we workers suggested to the bureau that they protect these materials and proposed specific measures; however, they were not adopted. At the end of the same year, the workers again proposed building two mat sheds to protect these machines, but the bureau only built one shed to store generators, etc., and most of the materials were still exposed to rain and sun. In 1950, when the bureau sent someone to inventory the machines, we workers again suggested in person that the machines be moved or repaired and preserved; but they said nothing and left after the inventory. In 1951, we workers again suggested that the bureau transfer the machines or build another mat shed and apply oil to the machines for storage; but the bureau only repaired the original shed. In 1952, when Comrade Kong from the Materials Section of the bureau came to inspect these machines, we again raised our opinions with him, and he promised to bring our opinions back; but there was still no response. Later, the bureau was going to transfer the machines, and the workers were very excited; but in the end, only one cement mixer was transferred to the Civil Engineering Construction Company of the Power Industry Management Bureau. The other machines are still there.
    This matter is not only raised by us workers, but also by the administrative side of the Tangshan Power Plant and the Tangshan Power Bureau many times. Every year when the bureau sends people to take inventory, they clearly know that the machines are rusting, but they don't care, they only know to reduce the depreciation rate every year. Now some of the components have been "depreciated" to only 40%. Many machines left in the open have rusted into scrap. Small trees have grown on some large components. The large I-beams have oxidized. When the welders in our factory's repair shop need iron oxide when electric welding, they don't need to buy it, they just go to the machine pile to get it. Therefore, the workers call the place where the machines are piled up the "iron oxide field." We workers feel heartbroken, and many comrades who come to our factory to visit also feel sorry.
    It is said that these machines were allocated to the North China Power Industry Management Bureau at the end of 1952. We believe that no matter who manages them, they should quickly sort out these machines, apply oil to them, and store them well, so that they can be used for the construction of power plants in the country in the future. The original Power Industry Management Bureau should deeply examine this behavior of not cherishing state property.
    The Fujian Provincial Department of Finance Should Not Shelter
    Acts of Violating Financial Discipline
    Huang Wenyan from the Administrative Finance Section of the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance writes: The Fujian Provincial Department of Finance allocated a large amount of construction funds after October 1952, of which 24.8 billion yuan was allocated to directly affiliated一级机关 organs of the province (excluding public institutions). These funds were allocated too late, and most of the basic construction projects could not be handled in accordance with the necessary conditions for basic construction. After receiving the funds, the various organs universally抢购 grabbed houses and land in Fuzhou, driving up land prices. For example, Fuzhou University, the Fujian Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Fujian Provincial Insurance Company, among other organs,抢购 grabbed a civilian house, gradually increasing the price by one time. More seriously, many ordinary people were forced to move, causing a housing shortage, which the local residents and government were very dissatisfied with.
    Because a large amount of money was allocated very late, most of the projects could not be completed as scheduled at the end of 1952. According to regulations, money not used by the end of the year should be turned over to the state treasury, but many organs paid out and reimbursed according to the budget amount, regardless of the progress of their basic construction projects, in order to avoid freezing. For example, of the 6 billion yuan reimbursed by the Provincial People's Government Guest House for building houses, 1 billion yuan of the project has not yet officially started construction. The Industry Department's self-managed project of 565.5 million yuan had 25 million yuan left unused by the end of the year, so they obtained the consent of the Provincial Construction Company, falsely claiming that the project was contracted by the construction company, and transferred the money to the construction company's account. In fact, the project was still being built by the Industry Department itself. This phenomenon is universal. The Provincial Financial and Economic Committee and the Department of Finance were aware of the units' violations of financial discipline of "avoiding the freezing of funds" and "turning public funds into small public funds," but took a protective attitude. These consciously transferred funds were also reimbursed in the 1952 final accounts. The Zhengyang County Grain Bureau's irresponsible work caused more than 600 disaster victims transporting grain to be disappointed.
    Chu Huacheng from the Third District People's Government of Zhengyang County, Henan Province, writes: On February 27, the Zhengyang County Grain Bureau specially sent four cadres, including Guo Qiwen, with urgent instructions to our third district, asking our district people's government to quickly mobilize 750 disaster victims to go to the Queshan County Grain Depot on February 28 to transport 40,000 jin of grain to Hanzhen Town in the third district of Zhengyang (120 li apart), and the wage for transporting grain was also stipulated. Our district people's government notified the seven townships under its jurisdiction overnight to mobilize disaster victims to transport grain. As a result, 620 disaster victims were organized, with 69 donkeys and 12 carts, and set off early on February 28, arriving at the Queshan Grain Depot that night. Unexpectedly, the responsible comrade of the grain depot said: "The grain that your county should transfer from here has been transported!" The disaster victims raised objections, but the responsible comrade of the Queshan County Grain Depot and Comrade Guo Qiwen did not care and only let the disaster victims go back. Although the more than 600 disaster victims were very dissatisfied, they had to return overnight. The Zhengyang County Grain Bureau's practice of issuing instructions乱发指示, wasting manpower and resources is wrong. They should find out the reason, make a public检讨 criticism in the newspaper, and appropriately compensate the masses for their losses. The Lack of Planning by the Hunan Provincial Department of Education
    Has Caused Difficulties in the Supply of Textbooks
    Lei Fang, Sun Fuqing, and five others from the Xinhua Bookstore Hunan Branch write: The Hunan Provincial Department of Education lacks planning for setting up classes and enrolling students in primary schools, which has caused difficulties for the Xinhua Bookstore in supplying primary school textbooks and has caused undue losses to people's property. In the spring of 1952, the department originally said that it would enroll 700,000 new students in junior primary schools and notified the Xinhua Bookstore Hunan Branch to prepare textbooks. Our store purchased and transported 700,000 sets of the first volume of junior primary school textbooks (valued at more than 1.5 billion yuan) from the East China General Branch. However, after this batch of textbooks was transported from Shanghai to our province, the Department of Education said that it would not enroll students. We had to transfer the textbooks to Fujian, Xinjiang, North China, and other places, wasting more than 40 million yuan in transportation costs (not including the transportation costs from Shanghai to various counties in our province). This spring, the Department of Education notified us to prepare 135,000 sets of the first volume of senior primary school fifth-grade textbooks. The books have been sent from Hankou to our province's branches, but the Department of Education said that they don't need these books. After the above problems occurred, we raised our opinions with the Department of Education and asked to investigate the responsibility, but the department did not humbly examine its work. We believe that the Hunan Provincial Department of Education should use a serious spirit of self-criticism to examine and correct this lack of planning in its work.
    Handling of Reader Letters in Two Weeks
    From March 30 to April 12, the reader letters group of this newspaper received a total of 3,908 reader letters, and various agencies replied to 685 reader letters. Among them, 1,851 letters were related to political and legal issues, 1,475 letters were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 1,206 letters were related to cultural and educational issues, and 61 letters were of other natures. Eighty-seven were published in this newspaper, 990 were answered individually to readers, 1,831 were forwarded to relevant agencies for investigation, handling, reply, or reference, 1,443 were kept by this newspaper for reference and did not require further processing, and the rest are being studied and processed. During this period, the reader letters group of this newspaper issued 4,149 replies to readers, forwarded letters to relevant agencies for investigation and handling, and expedited letters. In addition, there were 896 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers looking for revolutionary soldiers, which were not included in the statistics.
    In the letters related to basic construction, readers reported on the serious delays in construction caused by large changes in plans and insufficient design capabilities in some projects, as well as the inability to carry out material storage and purchase and construction personnel allocation in a planned manner; reported on the serious chaos in some basic construction projects that were already under construction and had no one responsible; and put forward suggestions for further promoting standard designs. We are studying these letters and plan to select some for publication. In addition, we continue to receive many letters reporting mines, and some readers have sent mineral samples; we have forwarded these letters to the Ministry of Geology for unified processing and direct contact with readers.
    In the letters related to spring plowing production, readers reported on the situation of leading cadres of people's governments in some areas going deep into the masses to inspect and lead spring plowing production; reflected the situation of party and government leading organs in some areas carrying out the struggle against bureaucratism in conjunction with spring plowing production; exposed the bureaucratic style of some local people's governments in leading spring plowing production; reflected the impact of the lack of new agricultural machinery parts on production in some areas; and also put forward suggestions for inspecting the work of代耕 plowing on behalf of others in conjunction with spring plowing production. We have already published some of the above letters and will continue to select a batch, and the rest will be kept for reference or forwarded to the relevant agencies for processing.
    In the letters of these two weeks, readers also reported that some counties have checked bureaucratic and illegal乱纪 behavior by convening people's representatives meetings, party representatives meetings or in combination with party rectification, and that people's governments in some places have strengthened the handling of people's letters and visits after the anti-bureaucratic struggle; reported new atmosphere after the implementation of the Marriage Law; exposed some grain spoilage incidents and confusion in grain allocation, and also reflected some confusion after the merger of grain bureau and grain company organizations. We will select some of the above letters for public publication, and the rest will be forwarded to the relevant agencies for processing and kept for reference. Some letters also reflected the imbalance of grain supply in some cotton-producing areas and the request to continue purchasing stored cotton; reflected the lack of uniformity in the forms of commercial departments, causing waste of manpower and material resources and difficulties for lower-level agencies; reflected the large-scale transfer of cadres to engage in central work in some areas, which affected the business work of some departments; reflected some industrial and mining units randomly recruiting on-the-job cadres, which affected the production of other industrial and mining units; reflected the unreasonable working hours of some organ cadres. The above issues are very important, and we are studying them for processing.
    In addition, the "Answers to Several Questions on Voter Qualifications by the Central Election Committee" published in this newspaper on April 6 and the "Questions and Answers to Readers" in this newspaper on April 8 on "Several Questions on People's Congresses" have already made public answers to the questions raised on convening people's congresses and voter qualifications; we have forwarded some questions related to the repayment of public debt to the People's Bank of China for direct processing; after we forwarded the opinions reflecting that the postal remittance fee is too high and the procedures are too complicated to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the ministry is studying ways to improve the situation; readers can raise opinions about periodicals being sent incorrectly, late, or lost to the local post and telecommunications bureau that directly manages the distribution of periodicals. We will no longer make individual replies to letters concerning the above issues.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    一千六百多吨豆饼款积压一年多没有结清
    东北粮食管理局郭化英来信：一九五一年十二月份原东北区粮食公司发往关内的豆饼是由中国土产公司接收经营的。后经中央财经委员会批准，这个业务在一九五二年转给中华全国合作总社粮食经理部经营。当时因中国土产公司和中华全国合作总社尚未办理移交，原东北区粮食公司仍按中国土产公司十二月份计划发运豆饼。十二月份东北各地粮食公司发往浙江省杭州、嘉兴、宁波等地土产公司豆饼共计一千六百二十七吨，因各地土产公司已接到上级指示，就让当地合作社接收。合作社误认为是总社下拨的，即将接收数量呈报华东区合作总社，而华东区合作总社当时也认为这是总社下拨豆饼。一直到一九五二年第三季度中华全国合作总社粮食经理部派人检查华东区工作时，才发觉这批豆饼不是总社下拨的；但对这批豆饼的来源也不清楚。到一九五三年一月，浙江省合作总社才将该项豆饼款解给总社粮食经理部暂存，待问题查清后再行处理。但另方面的情况是：原东北区粮食公司曾要和中国土产公司结账，但中国土产公司不承认接收了这批豆饼。总之，原东北区粮食公司、中国土产公司和中华全国合作总社在工作上不够衔接，致使一千六百多吨豆饼款在基层单位积压一年多，至今尚未最后结清。希望上述三单位迅速查清积压的原因，以作为今后工作的教训。
    放在露天的机器上长了小树
    唐山发电厂三个工人来信：中央燃料工业部原电业管理总局对存放在唐山发电厂的大批机器、机件和配件（估计价值在三百亿元以上）不好好保管。这些机器中除了发电机和一些机件还有席棚遮蔽外，大部都抛在草堆中，任凭风吹雨淋日晒，有很多已锈得不能用了。不少工人曾多次向原电业管理总局提出意见，但始终没引起该局重视。
    提起这些机器，说来话长。一九四五年日本鬼子统治时期，要在唐山修建第二发电厂，就运来大型发电机——透平机、起重机、锅炉、洋灰混合机以及其它很多机件、配件。抗日战争胜利后，蒋介石匪帮就任这些物资原封不动地掷在草地上。一九四八年底唐山解放了，工人做了国家的主人，对这些物资十分关心，希望以后能把它用到祖国大规模建设中去。原电业管理总局接收了这些物资，虽曾指示任何人也不准动用，但他们自己并没好好管。一九四九年这些东西被水淹了，我们工人向总局建议保护这批物资，并提出了具体办法；结果却没被采纳。同年年底，工人又提议盖两个席棚来保护这批机器，结果总局只盖了一个席棚放发电机等，大部物资还是雨淋日晒着。一九五○年，总局派人来清点时，我们工人又当面建议把机器运走或修理保留；但他们什么也没说，清点完就走了。一九五一年，我们工人又建议总局把机器调走，或再盖一个席棚，把机器擦上油保管起来；但总局只把原来的一个棚修补了一下。一九五二年总局材料科派一位姓孔的同志来检查这批机器时，我们又向他提意见，他答应一定把我们的意见带回去；结果还是没下文。后来总局要来调机器了，工人们都很兴奋；但结果只调了一个洋灰混合机给电业管理总局土木建筑公司。其它机器至今还放着。
    这件事不单我们工人提意见，唐山发电厂行政方面和唐山电业局也提过不少次意见。每年总局派人来清点时，明明知道机器锈坏了，也不管，只知道每年降折旧率，现在有的机件已“折”得只剩百分之四十了。不少放在露天的机器已锈成废品。有些大的机件上已长上小树。大工字铁氧化了，我厂修配车间焊工作电焊条时需要氧化铁不用去买，就到机器堆去取。因此，工人把堆机器的地方叫做“氧化铁场”。我们工人们感到痛心，很多到我厂来参观的同志也感到可惜。
    听说这批机器在一九五二年底已拨归华北电业管理总局了。我们认为：不论谁管，都应该迅速把这批机器整理、上油，很好保管，以后好供祖国修建发电厂用。原电业管理总局应该深刻检查这种不爱护国家物资的行为。
    福建省财政厅不应该包庇
    违犯财政纪律的行为
    福建省财政厅行政财务科黄文彦来信：福建省财政厅在一九五二年十月份以后，拨付了大批的修建费，其中拨给省直属一级机关就占二百四十八亿元
    （事业单位除外）。这些款拨出时间太晚，大部分基本建设工程都未能按照基本建设应有的条件来办理。而各机关拿到款后普遍在福州市抢购房屋地基，乱抬地价。如福州大学、福建省总工会和福建省保险公司等机关抢购一处民房，把房价逐步提高了一倍。更严重的是，很多老百姓被赶搬家，造成房荒，当地居民和政府都很不满意。
    因为大批款子拨得很迟，大部分工程不能如期在一九五二年年底完工。按规定年终没有用完的钱应上缴国库，但不少机关不论其基本建设工程进度如何，就按照预算数全部付出和报销，以逃避冻结。如省人民政府招待所盖房子报销的六十亿元中，就有十亿元的工程到目前还未正式开始动工。工业厅自办工程五亿六千五百万元到年底还有二千五百万元没用掉，他们就取得省建筑公司的同意，假称这个工程由建筑公司承包，把钱转移到建筑公司账内，事实上工程还是由工业厅自己兴修。这样的现象是普遍的。省财经委员会和财政厅明知各单位有“逃避资金的冻结”和“化大公为小公”的违犯财政纪律的行为，但却采取庇护的态度。这些有意识地被转移的钱，在一九五二年的决算内也报销了。正阳县粮食局工作太不负责使六百多名运粮灾民扑了个空
    河南省正阳县第三区人民政府楚华成来信：正阳县粮食局在二月二十七日专派郭其文等四个干部随带紧急指示到我们第三区，让我区人民政府迅速动员七百五十名灾民在二月二十八日前往确山县粮库把四万斤粮食运到正阳三区寒冻镇（两地相距一百二十里地），运粮工资也作了规定。我区人民政府连夜通知所属七个乡动员灾民去调运粮食。结果组织了灾民六百二十名，带驴六十九头，小车子十二辆，在二月二十八日清早启程，当夜赶到了确山粮库。不料，该粮库负责同志说：“你县该从这里调运的粮食已运完了！”灾民提出意见，但确山县粮库负责同志和郭其文同志都不管，只是让灾民回去。六百多灾民虽然十分不满，也只得连夜返回。正阳县粮食局乱发指示、浪费民力的做法是错误的，他们应该查明原因，在报纸上作公开检讨，并适当补偿群众损失。湖南省教育厅工作缺乏计划
    使教科书供应工作发生困难
    新华书店湖南分店雷芳、孙富卿等五人来信：湖南省教育厅对小学设班招生缺乏计划性，致使新华书店供应小学课本的工作发生困难，并使人民财产遭受不应有的损失。一九五二年春季，该厅原说要招收初小新生七十万名，通知新华书店湖南分店准备课本。我店就从华东总分店购运了初小第一册课本七十万套（计值人民币十五亿余元）。但这批课本由上海运到我省后，教育厅又说不招生了。我们只好将课本调往福建、新疆、华北等地，浪费运费四千多万元（由上海发到我省各县的运费还不包括在内）。今年春季教育厅通知我们备高小五年级一册课本十三万五千套，书已由汉口发到我省各支店，教育厅又说不需要这些书了。以上问题发生后，我们向教育厅提出意见，要求追查责任，但该厅却不虚心地检查自己的工作。我们认为湖南省教育厅应该用严肃的自我批评精神来检查并纠正这种工作缺乏计划性的情况。
