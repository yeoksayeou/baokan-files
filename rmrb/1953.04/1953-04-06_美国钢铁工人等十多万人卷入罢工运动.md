Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: The American workers' strike movement continues to develop. According to a Reuters report on the 3rd, more than 100,000 American workers are participating in or affected by strikes.

1,500 railway workers of the Union Railroad Company, a subsidiary of United States Steel Corporation in Pittsburgh, held a spontaneous strike on March 31 to protest the unreasonable dismissal of two worker leaders by the capitalists. The strike has severely affected the supply of raw materials to many steel factories. United States Steel Corporation has been forced to order the shutdown of steelmaking at its four major factories. The jobs of 50,000 steelworkers and workers in related departments have been suspended. The strike is costing United States Steel Corporation 25,000 tons of steel per day.

35,000 rubber workers of the United Rubber Company (belonging to the CIO United Rubber Workers Union) began a strike on the 2nd, demanding improved working conditions and workers' welfare. Another 35,000 non-union rubber workers at the company have also refused to cross the picket lines. The strike has completely paralyzed nineteen factories of the United Rubber Company from New England to California, which manufacture chemicals, automobile tires, and other materials.

The strike of American electrical workers is also expanding. Following the strike of 5,600 workers at the General Electric Company in Evendale, Ohio, 10,000 workers at the General Electric Company in Syracuse, New York, also went on strike on the 3rd, demanding a wage increase of 16 cents per hour. The production of jet aircraft engines at the General Electric Company's Evendale plant has been completely interrupted, and the production of other war materials has also been greatly affected.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet Komsomolskaya Pravda published an article by Dosoteev, commenting on the increasingly impoverished lives of the American people.

The author wrote: Since the United States launched its war of aggression in Korea, prices of necessities in the United States have continued to rise. During this period, food prices have risen by 29 percent. This is not due to a shortage of food, but because American monopoly capitalists would rather destroy "surplus" grain to maintain high prices than lower food prices.

The author continued: The lives of Black people are particularly difficult. Their wages are about half that of white workers. Women workers' wages are also very meager, accounting for only 40 percent of men's wages. Hunger has driven millions of children to seek employment. According to incomplete statistics, American factories employed 2.3 million child laborers in October 1951.

The author pointed out: Eighty percent of the American population, or 120 million people, earn wages that do not reach the meager wages that the government considers the "minimum level." Among them, 30 million people earn only one-quarter of the minimum wage, and 24 million earn one-eighth. If this is the situation for employed workers, then the degree of poverty of unemployed and partially employed workers is not difficult to imagine. There are currently 13 million such workers in the United States.

Dosoteev continued: Poor living conditions have deepened the poverty and suffering of the American working people. Millions of American citizens live in slums, but they have to pay high rents. These rents account for one-third of their income, and in many cases, even one-half of their income. In New York, 500,000 people urgently need housing. The situation of World War II veterans is extremely difficult.

American farmers are also increasingly falling into the abyss of poverty. American monopoly capital is adopting a policy of deliberately bankrupting middle and small farmers in order to seize their land. Precisely because of this policy, the number of farms in the United States has decreased by almost 500,000 since World War II.

Dosoteev concluded: The continuous impoverishment of all strata of the American people is the main feature of the so-called "American way of life."

    美国钢铁工人等十多万人卷入罢工运动
    【新华社四日讯】美国工人罢工运动继续发展。据路透社三日消息，参加罢工与受到罢工影响的美国工人达十多万人。
    匹兹堡美国钢铁公司所属联合铁路公司一千五百名铁路工人，在三月三十一日举行自发罢工，抗议资方无理撤销两名工人领袖的职务。罢工使许多钢铁工厂的原料供应工作受到严重的影响。美国钢铁公司已被迫下令它的四家大工厂停止炼钢。五万名钢铁工人及有关部门的工人的工作已告停顿。罢工使美国钢铁公司每天损失二万五千吨钢。
    美国联合橡胶公司三万五千名橡胶工人（属于产联联合橡胶工人工会）从二日开始举行罢工，要求改善工作条件与工人生活福利。该公司另外三万五千名不属于工会的橡胶工人也拒绝越过罢工纠察线。罢工已经使美国联合橡胶公司从新英格兰到加利福尼亚州的十九家制造化学品、汽车轮胎等物资的工厂完全瘫痪。
    美国电气工人的罢工也正在扩大中。继俄亥俄州伊凡达尔的通用电气公司五千六百名工人开始罢工以后，纽约州西拉克斯镇通用电气公司一万工人也在三日举行罢工，要求每小时工资提高一角六分。通用电气公司伊凡达尔工厂的喷气飞机引擎的生产已完全中断，该公司其他战争物资的生产也受到很大的影响。
    据新华社讯：苏联青年团真理报发表了多索特塞夫的一篇文章，评论美国人民日益贫困的生活。
    作者写道：自从美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争以来，美国必需品价格不断高涨。在这一个时期内，粮食价格上涨了百分之二十九。这并不是由于缺乏粮食。而是由于美国的垄断资本家宁愿毁坏“过剩”的粮食来维持高昂的价格，而不肯降低粮价。
    作者接着说：黑人的生活特别困难。他们的工资约比白种工人少一半。女工的工资也十分菲薄，只占男工工资百分之四十。饥饿已经驱使数百万儿童去找寻职业。根据不完全的统计，美国工厂在一九五一年十月雇用了二百三十万童工。
    作者指出：美国人口百分之八十，即一亿二千万人的工资，都达不到政府认为是“最低水平”的少得可怜的工资。其中三千万人的工资只是最低工资的四分之一，二千四百万人赚得八分之一。如果这就是就业工人的情况，那么失业与部分就业的工人的贫困程度就不难想像了。这一类工人目前在美国有一千三百万人。
    多索特塞夫继续写道：居住条件的恶劣加深了美国劳动人民的贫困与痛苦。美国千百万公民住在贫民窟里，但他们却要交很高的租金。这些租金占了他们收入三分之一，在许多情形下，甚至占到他们收入的二分之一。在纽约有五十万人迫切需要住房。第二次世界大战的退伍军人的处境极端困难。
    美国农民也日益陷入贫困的深渊。美国的垄断资本正在采取一种故意使中农与小农破产的政策，以便夺取他们的土地。正由于这一个政策，美国的农场在第二次世界大战后差不多减少了五十万个。
    多索特塞夫最后写道：美国人民各阶层的不断贫困化正是所谓“美国生活方式”的主要特色。
