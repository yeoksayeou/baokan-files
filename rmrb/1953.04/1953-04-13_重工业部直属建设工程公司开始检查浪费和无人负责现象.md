The Construction Engineering Company Directly Under the Ministry of Heavy Industry Begins to Inspect Waste and Lack of Accountability

[This newspaper dispatch] The Construction Engineering Company directly under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has launched a campaign against waste and to establish a responsibility system. On March 31st, the company held an enlarged meeting of cadres, conveyed the instructions of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry regarding the work for the entire year of 1953, and decided to launch a campaign in April focused on opposing waste and the phenomenon of lack of accountability, in order to establish a responsibility system through this inspection.

At the beginning of the campaign, Li Wanjie, the manager of the company, examined the shortcomings in the leadership's work. He said that in the past, emphasis was only placed on completing tasks, without paying attention to project quality and precise cost calculation; it was thought that "catching up with the progress is 'good,'" completely failing to establish the view of "good, fast, and economical." This simple task-oriented viewpoint, coupled with the failure to establish a responsibility system, is the main reason for the waste phenomenon.

Although the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry completed its engineering tasks last year, it also seriously wasted national resources. The waste caused by poor project quality is very serious. Some projects have foundation subsidence and wall cracks. Some repaired sewers need to be reworked. The 400-meter-long sewer at the Beiling construction site needs to be rebuilt, wasting more than 90 million yuan. Some of the concrete floors in the student dormitory of the Northeast Institute of Technology have cracked or peeled off. The cement floors at the Nantai, Beitai, and Beiling construction sites need to be reworked due to their poor quality, wasting 500 tons of cement, and the rework cost will reach more than 440 million yuan. Some repaired corrugated iron roofs were blown away by the wind. The reason for this low quality is that the construction units simply pursued progress and did not carefully follow the design requirements and operating procedures for construction. Many construction workers do not even look at the construction drawings. No one inspects the quality of the project. Cadres on the construction site mistakenly thought: "As long as the progress is guaranteed, a little bit of poor quality doesn't matter."

Due to simply pursuing progress, the lack of economic accounting in the use of machinery, equipment, materials, and tools has also seriously wasted national resources. The utilization rate of concrete mixers is only 30%. The utilization rate of tank-type cranes is only 8.4%. The average utilization rate of equipment last year was only 22.5%. Some equipment, such as mortar mixers and clean water pumps, were not used at all. Failure to pay attention to improving equipment utilization and neglecting equipment maintenance has become a common phenomenon. Workers said: "Our mixers are used one day and stopped one day, and no one cares." In the material supply work, there is no realistic plan as a basis, and materials are purchased blindly based on what the site needs. Construction units always want to ask for more materials. In this way, the phenomenon of material backlog continues to occur. Last year, the company had a backlog of 25 billion yuan worth of materials, and this year it has a backlog of 3 billion yuan worth of materials. The Northeast Institute of Technology blindly purchased 2,700 cubic meters of rubble and more than 1,300 tons of round steel, regardless of the project's needs, and had to leave them unused. In the use of funds, control is not strict, and supervision is insufficient. The finance department has become a simple "fund supply station." The company's management fees, material costs, depreciation costs, and temporary project costs for last year have not yet been correctly finalized. In construction management, there is no detailed plan and no specialized system is established, which inevitably leads to waste. Before the start of construction last year, construction was carried out blindly without adequate preparation. Therefore, from March to July last year, only 27.29% of the total project tasks were completed. In August, September, and October, however, 61.49% of the total project tasks had to be rushed. The result of this failure to complete the plan in a balanced manner is the waste of manpower, overtime work, and neglect of quality. Before July last year, because many preparatory works were not done well, many workers waited for tools and materials, and an average of 500 workers were out of work every day. After July, in order to rush the task, it was necessary to rush day and night, neglecting the quality of the project. Because a system of designated personnel and responsibilities has not been established and improved, many wasteful phenomena have also occurred. Materials are not managed by designated personnel and are thrown around everywhere. On the one hand, materials are backlogged, and on the other hand, work is suspended due to waiting for materials. A large amount of dolomite is backlogged at the Beiling construction site, while the Nanhai construction site is suspended due to lack of dolomite. Some workers have many tools at hand, while some workers are suspended waiting for tools. Some workers who were transferred to the Northeast Institute of Technology from other places had no work to do and no houses to live in when they arrived at the site. This phenomenon of lack of accountability has caused great losses to the country.

After holding an enlarged meeting of cadres and examining the mistakes and shortcomings in the past work, the leading cadres of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Construction Engineering Company have begun to mobilize all employees to discuss the construction work last year, boldly expose the waste and lack of accountability in the construction. At present, the company's departments and teams have held meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism, examine the waste and lack of accountability, and the reasons for these phenomena. While combating waste and establishing a responsibility system, the current preparatory work is also being examined. Many technicians have learned from past lessons and have begun to formulate construction organization designs to strengthen the planning and organization of this year's construction and overcome the phenomena of waste and lack of accountability.

### 重工业部直属建设工程公司开始检查浪费和无人负责现象

    重工业部直属建设工程公司开始检查浪费和无人负责现象
    【本报讯】中央重工业部直属建设工程公司已经展开反对浪费和建立责任制运动。三月三十一日，该公司召开干部扩大会议，传达了中央重工业部关于一九五三年全年工作的指示，同时决定在四月份内开展一个以反对浪费和无人负责现象为中心内容的运动，以便通过这次检查，建立起责任制度。
    运动开始时，该公司经理李万杰检查了领导工作中的缺点。他说，过去只强调完成任务，而没有重视工程质量和精确计算成本；认为“赶上了进度，就是‘好样的’”，完全没有确立“又好、又快、又省”的观点。这种单纯任务观点，加上责任制度没有建立，是产生浪费现象的主要原因。
    去年中央重工业部直属建设工程公司虽然完成了工程任务，但也严重地浪费了国家的资材。由于工程质量不好而产生的浪费现象是很严重的。有些工程的基础下沉，墙身裂缝。有些修好了的下水道，需要返工。北陵工地的四百公尺长的下水道，要重新修筑，浪费九千多万元。东北工学院的学生宿舍里的混凝土地板，有些已经裂开，有些已经脱落。南塔、北塔和北陵的工地的水泥地面，因为质量低劣而要返工，浪费水泥五百吨，返工费用将达四亿四千多万元。有些修好的洋铁瓦房盖，被风吹跑了。这种质量低劣的情况所以产生，是因为各施工单位单纯地追求进度，没有认真按着设计的要求和操作规范进行施工。许多施工员都不看施工图。工程质量也无人检查。工地上的干部错误地以为：“只要保证进度，质量差一点没有啥。”
    由于单纯追求进度，在机械设备和材料工具的使用上，缺乏经济核算观点，也严重地浪费了国家资材。混凝土搅拌机的利用率，只有百分之三十。坦克式吊车的利用率，只有百分之八点四。去年使用设备的平均利用率，仅仅达到百分之二十二点五。有些设备如灰浆搅拌机、清水泵等，根本就没有利用。不重视设备利用率的提高，忽视设备的检修工作，成了普遍的现象。工人们说：“我们的搅拌机，用一天，停一天，就没人过问。”在材料供应工作中，没有切合实际的计划作为根据，现场要什么，就给什么，盲目采购材料。施工单位总想多要一些材料。这样，材料的积压现象，就不断发生。去年该公司积压了二百五十亿元的材料，今年也积压了三十亿元的材料。东北工学院不根据工程的需要，盲目购买了二千七百立方公尺的块石、一千三百多吨的元钢，只好留下不用。在资金运用上，控制不严，监督不够。财务部门成了单纯的“资金供应站”。去年该公司的管理费、材料费、折旧费和临时工程费，一直到现在还不能做出正确的决算来。在施工管理上，没有周密的计划，没有建立专职制度，这样就必然产生浪费现象。在去年开工前，没有做好准备工作，就盲目施工。因此从去年三月到七月，只完成了全部工程任务的百分之二十七点二九。在八、九、十三个月中，却要突击完成全部工程任务的百分之六十一点四九。这种不能均衡地完成计划的结果是浪费人工、加班加点、忽视质量。在去年七月份以前，因为很多准备工作没做好，许多工人等待工具、材料，每天平均有五百个工人没有工作。在七月份以后，为了突击任务，只好日夜赶工，忽视了工程的质量。由于没有建立和健全专人专责制度，因而也产生许多浪费的现象。材料没有专人管理，到处乱丢。一方面积压材料，另一方面又停工待料。北陵工地积压大批白云灰，南湖工地因为没有白云灰而停工。有些工人手边有着很多工具，有些工人却停工等待工具。有些从别处调到东北工学院工作的工人，到了现场，没有活干，没有房子住。这种无人负责的现象，使得国家遭受了很大的损失。
    中央重工业部直属建设工程公司的领导干部在召开了干部扩大会议，检查了过去工作中的错误和缺点之后，已开始发动全体职工讨论去年施工工作，大胆揭发施工中的浪费和无人负责的现象。现在该公司各科、队已纷纷召开会议，展开批评与自我批评，检查浪费和无人负责的情况和产生这些现象的原因。在反浪费和建立责任制的同时，又检查目前的准备工作，许多技术人员接受过去的教训，开始制订施工组织设计，以加强今年施工中的计划性和组织性，克服浪费现象和无人负责现象。
