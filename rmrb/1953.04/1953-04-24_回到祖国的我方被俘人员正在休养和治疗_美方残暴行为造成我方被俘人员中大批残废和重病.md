Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd – Sick and wounded Korean and Chinese personnel repatriated to the embrace of the motherland are recuperating and undergoing preliminary diagnosis and treatment in various temporary hospitals. The hospitals are adorned with the national flags of both Korea and China, and planted with flowers everywhere, making them as beautiful and tranquil as parks. In a certain hospital, formerly a biological research institute, the sick and wounded personnel of the Korean People's Army sit on benches specially set up for them on the lawn. They lean their crutches against the trees, singing "Song of General Kim Il-sung" and "March of the People's Army" with abandon. After a short break, they participate in a welcoming ceremony, where the hospital director, representatives of the Kaesong City government and people, and representatives of the Korean and Chinese forces stationed in the Kaesong area all give speeches. Sick and wounded personnel returning each day receive such a welcome. In another hospital, the sick and wounded personnel of the Korean People's Army are reading newspapers in tents. At the eastern end of this hospital area is a small "Cultural Recreation Park," with many flowers transplanted inside green fences, and specially made benches placed among the flowers. There are five tents here, two of which are reading rooms, filled with various books, newspapers and pictorials; the other three tents are for playing chess and poker. Each tent is filled with people playing and reading.

After returning to the embrace of the motherland, each of these sick and wounded personnel is eager to recount their deepest feelings: some say they couldn't hold back their tears when they heard our receiving personnel say "Comrades, get off the vehicle!" as the other side's ambulance doors opened; some felt the warmth of the motherland upon seeing the enthusiasm of the welcoming crowds; some were delighted to see the Korean and Chinese nurses working closely together in the hospital; and they all felt the unparalleled strength of the forces defending peace upon seeing the grand scale of their reception, the thoroughness of the preparations, and the abundance of supplies.

In the hospital where the sick and wounded personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are staying, as soon as breakfast is over, the loudspeakers broadcast songs of the motherland, and the sick and wounded personnel gather around to read "People's Pictorial," constantly cheering upon seeing the prosperity of the motherland. Many people say: The motherland has changed so quickly in the two years we've been away! It is the prosperity of the motherland that has enabled us to escape from the hell on earth today! On the evening of the 21st, they watched the movie "Long Live Peace," and the improvement of the motherland's international status and the strength of the forces defending peace further inspired them. One wounded soldier said: "How many people came to Beijing for the meeting, how many people support peace!" On the 22nd, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Cultural Troupe gave a慰问performance for them. Many critically ill or seriously wounded people who could not move were carried or carried on people's backs to the square. Before the performance, they sang loudly "The East is Red," "Song of General Kim Il-sung" and "October Red Flag Song," which they composed themselves in the POW camp. In the POW camp, many comrades shed blood and even gave their lives in order to sing these songs.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd – Judging from the sick and wounded POWs received by our side up to the 22nd, the proportion of disabled and chronically ill people is shockingly high. Among the 550 POWs received in a certain hospital, preliminary diagnosis revealed a total of 221 disabled individuals. Some of the disabilities were caused by enemy beatings in the POW camps. On October 1st last year, when Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs in the Jeju Island POW camp raised the flag to celebrate National Day, the U.S. side used tanks to cover infantry and rushed into the camp, carrying out a large-scale massacre, resulting in many POWs being killed and injured. One of the wounded repatriated personnel was shot in the buttocks at that time. The U.S. side only applied a little iodine to the wound and did not provide any treatment at all, causing his left leg to cramp, unable to straighten, and become disabled. He is still unable to sit up.

According to the preliminary diagnosis results of the same hospital, 189 of the 221 disabled personnel received by the hospital were disabled due to lack of treatment or improper treatment in U.S. POW camps. One repatriated person was merely suffering from frostbite on his hands and feet, but the U.S. side delayed treatment for a long time, causing his feet to swell and bleed. Later, he was sent to Busan, where the "treatment" he received was merely a dab of iodine. A week later, the wound festered, and the enemy did not provide treatment, but instead sawed off both legs at the knees. After a week, both hands were sawed off from the palms. In this way, he became disabled due to a mere case of frostbite.

The internal medicine department of this hospital received a total of 193 patients, and preliminary diagnosis revealed that 109 of them had tuberculosis. According to doctors' examinations, this was due to malnutrition, poor environment and excessive labor. One repatriated person was severely tortured by the enemy in the Geoje Island POW camp on February 25th last year, and interrogated as to whether he was a Communist. He was beaten so badly that he vomited blood, and his ears were also deafened. For one week, he only drank thin porridge twice. Now, this person, who was originally very strong before being captured, has suffered from long-term malnutrition, sleeping on damp ground, unable to change his clothes when they were wet, and living in a tent with many people in the U.S. POW camp, often engaging in heavy labor, so in addition to being deaf in one ear, he also contracted tuberculosis, which has now reached the second stage.

    回到祖国的我方被俘人员正在休养和治疗
    美方残暴行为造成我方被俘人员中大批残废和重病
    【新华社开城二十三日电】回到祖国怀抱的朝中病伤被俘人员正在各临时医院里休养和进行初步的诊断、治疗。各医院都飘扬着朝中两国国旗，到处都栽植了鲜花，像公园一样地美丽和幽静。在原来是生物研究所的某医院里，朝鲜人民军的病伤人员们坐在草坪上为他们特别设置的凳子上。他们把拐棍靠在树上，纵情地唱着“金日成将军之歌”、“人民军进行曲”。停了一会，他们参加了一个欢迎会，会上，医院的院长、开城市政府和人民的代表、驻开城地区朝中部队的代表都讲了话。每一天回来的病伤人员都受到这样的欢迎。在另一个医院里，朝鲜人民军病伤人员正在帐篷里读报。在这个医院区的东头有一个小小的“文化休息公园”，绿色的篱笆里面移植了很多鲜花，鲜花间摆着特制的凳子。这里有五个帐篷，两个是阅览室，里面摆了各种书籍、报纸和画报；另外三个帐篷是下棋和玩朴克的地方。每个帐篷里都有很多人在玩着和阅读着。
    这些病伤人员回到祖国的怀抱以后，每个人都急于叙述自己感触最深的事：有的说在对方救护车门被打开时，听到我方接收人员说“同志们下车吧！”就抑止不住眼泪；有的看到欢迎群众的热情而感到祖国的温暖；有的看到医院里朝中护士们在一起亲密工作而喜悦；他们看到接待他们的规模这样宏大，准备这样周到，物资这样丰富而感到保卫和平的力量的无比强大。
    在中国人民志愿军病伤人员住的医院里，刚吃过早饭，扩音器里就播送出祖国的歌曲，病伤人员们围在一起看“人民画报”，看到祖国的富强，不断地欢呼。许多人都说：离开祖国两年，祖国变得多快啊！是祖国的富强才使我们今天能脱离人间地狱！在二十一日晚上，他们看了“和平万岁”的电影，祖国国际地位的提高和保卫和平力量的强大，更使他们鼓舞。一个伤员说：“有多少人到北京开会，有多少人拥护和平啊！”二十二日，中国人民志愿军文工团又向他们作了慰问演出，许多不能行动的重病或重伤的人都被抬到或背到广场上来。在演出以前，他们大声唱了“东方红”、“金日成将军之歌”和他们在战俘营自编的“十月红旗歌”。在战俘营里，为了唱这些歌曲，曾有许多同志流了血，甚至献出了生命。
    【新华社开城二十三日电】从到二十二日为止我方所接收的病伤被俘人员看来，残废的和患严重慢性病的人所占的比例大得惊人。在某医院所收容的五百五十名被俘人员中，初诊的结果共有残废二百二十一人。在残废者中有一些是在战俘营中被敌人打伤而造成的。去年十月一日，济州岛战俘营中的中国人民志愿军被俘人员升旗庆祝国庆，美方就用坦克掩护步兵冲进营场，大肆屠杀，战俘死亡和受伤的很多。遣返回来的伤员中有一个人当时被枪弹打伤臀部，美方除了在伤口涂了一点碘酒以外，根本不予治疗，以致他的左腿抽筋，不能伸直，变成残废，至今还不能坐起来。
    据同一医院初诊的结果，在该院收容的二百二十一个残废人员中，有一百八十九人是因为在美国战俘营中没有得到治疗或治疗不当而残废的。有一个遣返人员，本来仅仅是手脚冻伤，但美方拖延很久，不给医治，以致两脚发肿，流血水。后来他被送到釜山，得到的“治疗”也仅仅是涂点碘酒。一星期后伤口腐烂，敌人不给医治，反将两腿齐膝锯掉，经过一个星期后，又将两手从手心处锯掉。这样，他就仅仅因为一点冻伤而成为残废。
    这个医院的内科共收容了一百九十三个病人，初诊结果其中就有一百零九人患肺结核。据医生检查，这是由于营养不良、环境恶劣和过度的劳动所致。有一个遣返人员曾在去年二月二十五日在巨济岛战俘营被敌人严刑拷打，审问他是不是共产党员。他当时被打得吐血，耳朵也被打聋了，有一个星期只喝过两次稀饭。现在，这个在被俘前身体原是很强壮的人，因为在美方战俘营中长期营养不良，睡湿地，衣服淋湿了也不能换，和很多人挤住一个帐篷，经常从事沉重的劳动，所以除了聋了一个耳朵以外，还害了肺结核病，现在已经到了第二期。
