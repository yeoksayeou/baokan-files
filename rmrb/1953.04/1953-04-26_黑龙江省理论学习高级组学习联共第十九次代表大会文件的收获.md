    The senior theoretical study group in Heilongjiang Province, comprising 545 people (including 422 cadres at the department level), has achieved significant gains in studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, thanks to the provincial Party committee's treatment of leading the study as an important task.
    A. The main gains from studying the first unit, "The International Environment of the Soviet Union," are: Firstly, they learned the basic methods of analyzing the international situation and gained a new understanding of the basic characteristics of the post-war international situation, truly broadening their horizons. Many comrades previously had incorrect understandings of the contradictions between imperialists and the inevitability of war between them, which were corrected during this study. Everyone also gained a new understanding of the nature, significance, and role of the current world peace movement. This laid a theoretical foundation for future current affairs studies and increased enthusiasm for studying international issues.
    B. The main gains from studying the second unit, "The Internal Situation of the Soviet Union," are: A concrete and profound understanding of the unparalleled superiority of the Soviet socialist system over capitalism, thus further strengthening the enthusiasm and initiative to learn from the Soviet Union, specifically manifested in the following aspects:
    I. The Soviet Union's policy of prioritizing heavy industry in national industrialization is also the guiding principle for China's current large-scale construction, thereby deepening the understanding of our country's economic construction policies. For example, the Heilongjiang Match Factory built a new large workshop, but later, because match production did not need to be expanded, and there were more important factories that needed the space, it was decided that the match factory would remain at its old site. At that time, the factory's leaders were dissatisfied. During this study, the factory leaders reviewed their thinking and said: This time, they realized it was serious departmentalism, lacking an overall perspective. A comrade from the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Industry Department complained during this study that the Finance Department had invested too little in local areas in the past. After discussion, the ideological problem was resolved. In the past, Factory 127 was always unwilling to give up cadres when the higher authorities came to transfer them. After the study, they transferred more than 100 cadres this time, and the leadership was very satisfied. Moreover, the transfer of cadres not only did not affect the work, but also improved the work efficiency of the existing cadres. Many factories and state-owned farms also automatically reduced their budgets after this study, as they had previously over-reported them. The erroneous idea that "everything should be done on a large scale everywhere" was criticized and resolved during this study.
    II. The question of how to learn from the Soviet Union in various business departments has also been resolved better. When starting to study the second part of Comrade Malenkov's report, the Provincial Party Committee proposed that each department should examine the problems in its work, study ways to improve, and especially solve the problem of generalized leadership. For example, the industrial sector generally found that product quality was low, production was unbalanced, the technical level was low, the utilization of machinery and equipment was insufficient, and production competitions were not frequent. Therefore, special attention was paid to learning how to formulate scientific production plans, improve labor productivity, maximize the utilization rate of existing equipment, rationally organize labor competitions, and specifically promote advanced Soviet technology and experience. In the agricultural sector, it was found that our agricultural development was unbalanced, and there were phenomena such as neglecting production, engaging in handicraft workshops, and being greedy and rash in agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms. In addition, there were also problems such as the spontaneous development of animal husbandry and the lagging of technical yield increases behind needs. According to Malenkov's report, special studies were made on raising the harvest yield as the main task of agricultural production, emphasizing the importance of increasing the yield per unit area and producing more grain; learning from Soviet mechanized production, and studying how to promote new agricultural tools; and proposing to strengthen technical yield increases. In the area of animal husbandry, it was believed that the spirit of Soviet development of animal husbandry was to solve the problem of raw materials for light industry and the needs of the people, while the main goal of developing animal husbandry in this province was to solve the problem of production power. Finally, it was specially proposed to oppose generalized leadership, strengthen leadership over backward villages and settlements, and summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner. In the commercial field, the main focus was on learning how to serve production and the needs of the people. In other departments as well, they examined their work and how to learn from the Soviet Union in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.
    C. In studying the "Party" section, it was clearly recognized that the strength of the Soviet Communist Party lies in the unity and solidarity of the Party ranks and its close ties with the masses of the people. This led to the understanding of the decisive significance of improving the level of our Party and strengthening the Party's leadership for the current large-scale construction. It was also recognized that improving the Party must first improve the quality of Party members. Therefore, the importance of study by leading cadres and the importance of strengthening the leadership of the study of general cadres and doing a good job in Party consolidation work were particularly felt. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's role in national economic activities, because this is of decisive significance for the completion of the country's first five-year plan; thirdly, the correct selection of cadres is the key to whether the Party's work can be realized, thus improving the understanding of everyone's participation in cultivating cadres from the inspection of work. Fourthly, a deep understanding was gained that carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, is the driving force for our Party's progress and a concrete manifestation of the masses' active participation in national construction. Finally, the importance of ideological work for various tasks was deeply appreciated, and therefore the shortcomings existing in the above aspects were exposed.
    Many departments have enriched the content of the Party congress or the general membership meeting with the main problems that have been deeply recognized and checked in this study. For example, units such as the Eleventh Factory, the Fifteenth Factory, and the One-Two-Seven Factory prominently implemented the issues of improving quality and improving labor productivity. The Provincial People's Government focused on resolving the issues of strengthening learning and carrying out criticism. The Provincial Machinery Plant also plans to convene a special cadre meeting to resolve the issue of not paying attention to improving labor productivity in the past, which was examined in this study.
    After this study, many comrades wrote study心得 (xin de - insights) and papers to consolidate the gains from the study.

    黑龙江省理论学习高级组学习联共第十九次代表大会文件的收获
    黑龙江省理论学习高级组共五百四十五人（其中处长级干部四百二十二人），在学习联共第十九次代表大会文件中，由于省委把领导学习当作一项重要的工作来做，所以有显著的收获。
    甲、在学习第一单元“苏联的国际环境”时的主要收获：首先是学会了分析国际形势的基本方法，对战后国际形势的基本特点有了新的认识，真正扩大了眼界。对帝国主义之间的矛盾及关于帝国主义之间战争不可避免问题，很多同志过去有错误的认识，在这次学习中都得到了纠正。大家对于当前世界和平运动的性质、意义与作用，也有了新的认识。这给今后的时事学习打下了理论基础，提高了对国际问题学习的热情。
    乙、在学习第二单元“苏联的内部情况”时的主要收获是：对苏联社会主义制度对资本主义无可比拟的优越性，有了具体深刻的认识，因而进一步加强了学习苏联的热情与积极性，具体表现在以下几方面：
    一、苏联以重工业为重点的国家工业化方针，同样也是当前中国大规模建设的指导原则，从而更深刻地体会了我国经济建设的方针、政策。如省火柴厂新修了一所大厂坊，后因火柴生产不需扩大，而且有更重要的工厂需用，决定火柴厂仍在旧址不动，当时该厂领导干部不满；在这次学习中该厂领导干部检讨说：这回认识到这是严重的本位主义，缺乏整体观念。省人民政府工业厅某同志在这次学习中埋怨财政厅过去对地方投资少，经大家讨论解决了思想问题。一二七厂过去遇到上级来调干部总是不愿给。经过学习，这次抽调了一百多名干部，领导方面都很满意；而且干部抽调之后，不但未影响工作，反而使现有干部工作效率提高了。很多工厂和国营农场，过去多报预算，经这次学习也都自动减少。过去认为“处处样样都要大规模”的错误思想，这次都被批判，并得到了解决。
    二、怎样在各个不同业务部门学习苏联的问题也解决得较好。省委在学习马林科夫同志的报告第二部分开始时，即提出要各部门检查工作中的问题，研究改进办法，特别要解决领导一般化的问题。比如在工业部门普遍检查出产品质量低、生产不平衡、技术水平低、机器设备力运用不够和生产竞赛不经常等。因而就特别注意学习了如何制订科学的生产计划，提高劳动生产率，发挥现有设备的运用率，合理组织劳动竞赛，具体地推广苏联先进技术与经验等。在农业部门，检查出我们的农业发展不平衡，在农业生产合作社和国营农场中存在忽视生产、搞手工作坊和贪多冒进的现象，另外还存在：牧畜业自流、技术增产落后于需要等问题。根据马林科夫的报告，特别研究了提高收获量是农业生产的主要任务，强调了提高单位面积产量多打粮食的重要意义；学习苏联机械化生产，研究了我们如何推广新式农具的问题，并提出加强技术增产。在牧畜业方面，认为苏联发展牧畜业的精神是解决轻工业原料和人民需要，而本省发展牧畜业主要是解决生产动力问题。最后特别提出反对领导一般化，加强对落后村、屯的领导，并及时总结与推广先进经验。在商业方面主要是学习如何为生产与人民需要服务的问题。在其他各个部门，也都用批评与自我批评的精神检查了自己工作和如何学习苏联的问题。
    丙、在学习“党”的部分时，明确地认识了苏联共产党之所以有力量是因为党的队伍的团结、统一和它与人民群众的血肉联系。从而体会到提高我们党的水平、加强党的领导，对当前大规模建设的决定意义。并认识到提高党必须首先提高党员的质量。因此也就特别感到领导干部学习的重要性和加强对一般干部学习的领导、搞好整党工作的重要意义。其次是要加强党在国家经济活动中的作用，因为这对国家第一个五年计划的完成是有决定意义的；其三，正确挑选干部是党的工作能否实现的关键，因而提高了对大家动手、从检查工作中培养干部的认识。其四，对开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，是我党前进的动力，又是群众积极参加国家建设的具体表现，有了深刻的认识。最后，深刻地体会了思想工作对于各种工作的重要意义，因而对上述各方面所存在的缺点，都进行了揭发。
    很多部门都把在这次学习中所深刻认识到的和检查出的主要问题，充实到党代表会或党员大会的内容中去了。如十一厂、十五厂、一二七厂等单位，就突出地贯彻了提高质量和提高劳动生产率的问题。省人民政府集中地解决了加强学习和开展批评的问题。省机械场还准备专门召开干部大会解决这次学习中所检查出的过去没有注意提高劳动生产率的问题。
    这次学习以后，有许多同志都写了学习心得和论文，把学习中的收获更加巩固下来。
