    A Record of the Japanese People's Congress for Peace
    After a long period of preparation, the "Japanese People's Congress for Peace" opened on March 21st at the Kyobashi Public Hall in Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, and concluded victoriously on the 22nd. Through this Congress for Peace, the Japanese people's peace movement has taken a big step forward.
    Six hundred delegates attended this congress, coming from thirty-nine different prefectures and districts; Hokkaido alone sent forty delegates. These delegates represented peace-loving Japanese people from various regions, different classes, different occupations, different faiths, and different political views.
    The venue was decorated solemnly and simply. Behind the rostrum was a huge Picasso "Dove of Peace," with the slogan "Negotiate Peace" hanging above it, flanked by "Peace" cutouts in various languages. The atmosphere was filled with peace.
    At the start of the congress, the delegates elected the Chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, Ikuo Oyama, committee member Kenjiro Yanagida, Sadako Ogasawara from Hokkaido, Yoshioka from Okayama Prefecture, Yoshida from Kyushu, and Tamura from the Private Railway Workers' Union as the presidium. (During the congress, Shoji Ogata of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, Fuki Kushida of the Democratic Women's Association, and Professor Kazuo Matsuura, a famous scholar, were added to the presidium). The congress then began its agenda.
    First, Hideo Sakurai, a Japanese delegate who attended the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing, reported on his experiences in China. He excitedly described the new atmosphere in the New China, especially emphasizing the Chinese people's enthusiasm for peace. His report was warmly welcomed by all the delegates.
    Next, Yoshitaro Hirano, who had been to China to discuss the repatriation of Japanese nationals, gave a report on the issue of the return of Japanese nationals from China. He accused the Yoshida government of being hostile to the People's China in every way and of not caring about the postwar rehabilitation work. When the representatives of the Japanese people took on the task of assisting the repatriation of overseas Chinese, the Yoshida government obstructed them in every way, and even attempted to carry out ideological investigations and ask for intelligence from the returnees, persecuting them. He then recounted the meticulous care and assistance given by the Chinese government and people's organizations to the repatriation of Japanese nationals, which was deeply moving.
    Masaharu Hatanaka, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, made a supplementary report. He loudly appealed: "Now is the time for the Japanese people to stand up themselves, only peace-loving people can gain the trust of the Chinese people." He concluded by saying: "This autumn we must welcome the representatives of the Chinese Red Cross to Japan, and next year we will send a delegation for peace negotiations to China." His words were met with applause from the entire audience.
    Seimin Miyazaki, representative of the "Association for Assisting the Repatriation of Compatriots in China," said that the Yoshida government had forbidden the Japan Peace Liaison Committee and other three groups from setting up offices in Maizuru to handle repatriation matters. We must use the power of the people to implement this demand.
    At this time, Ikuo Oyama, a Japanese peace leader who was late due to business, arrived at the venue and received a warm welcome from all the delegates. Amid thunderous applause, he took to the stage and said: "I am very happy to be able to meet with peace representatives from all over the country. No matter what gathering it is, we must not forget the broad masses behind us. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has the support of more than one billion people, and the World People's Congress for Peace held in Vienna last December has the support of two billion people. You are here representing millions of people. Regardless of political views and beliefs, we welcome all those who support peace to participate." He pointed out the important position of the Japanese peace movement in the entire world peace movement, saying: "We should transform Japan, which is important military base for the United States, into a peace base for mankind. The people of the whole world have such hopes for us, and we must give them a satisfactory answer." The whole audience responded to his call with enthusiastic applause. Finally, he pointed out that the upcoming general election is an opportunity for the Japanese people to carry out the struggle for peace, and we should call on peace-loving people to thoroughly defeat Yoshida and Hatoyama and Shigemitsu, who are attempting to replace Yoshida and openly carry out rearmament. He also said: "I will fight to the end with everyone for this." The applause lasted for a long time.
    The monk Riri Nakayama, wearing a cassock, reported on the "Hanaoka Incident" on behalf of the Japan Buddhist Federation. He recounted the bloody atrocities committed by Japanese militarists during the war at the Hanaoka mine in Akita Prefecture, Japan, where they massacred large numbers of captured Chinese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese laborers, and explained that Japanese people's organizations were preparing to jointly commemorate the Chinese martyrs who died on April 1st. He requested the people to assist in transporting the ashes back to China. His speech deeply moved the delegates.
    Following this, the representative of Tachikawa City reported on the suffering of the local people due to the construction of a US military base. When he said that the local residents had no water to drink because gasoline had flowed into the wells and rivers, he took out a spoonful of well water brought from Tachikawa and set it on fire in public. This illustrates the tragic situation of the Japanese people today who are suffering from the disasters of militarization. He called on everyone to strengthen the struggle against the construction of military bases.
    The meeting continued in the afternoon. Kei Hozumi spoke freely about his impressions of visiting the Soviet Union. Based on the concrete facts he saw in the Soviet Union, a great peace-loving country, he exposed the lies spread by the Japanese reactionaries to slander the Soviet Union. Kisuke Miyakoshi, who had been to China to discuss Sino-Japanese trade issues, reported on "Trade Issues," criticizing the Yoshida government's war policies for causing Japan's trade to fall into an extremely tragic situation; pointing out that the Japanese people are eager to conduct Sino-Japanese trade, and the Japanese government cannot violate the will of the people. Santaro Awata, a delegate to the World People's Congress for Peace in Vienna, thoroughly conveyed the resolutions of the World People's Congress for Peace, pointing out the clear direction of the Japanese peace movement.
    After the congress read out congratulatory messages from peace organizations from various countries, representatives from various Japanese democratic groups gave speeches. Makoto Hori, representative of the Labor-Farmer Party, said: "We must wage a resolute struggle against the conspiracy to rearm Japan." Masamoto Ozawa, representative of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said: "The 30,000 repatriated compatriots have strengthened our peace forces." Shinichi Horie, representative of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, said: "We must fight to crush anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda!" Masao Iwama, representative of the Japanese Communist Party, said: "Waging a resolute struggle to remove the military bases in Japan is in line with the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people." Kiyoshi Takahashi, representative of the Central Federation of Disabled Veterans Groups, said: "The disabled veterans injured in World War II resolutely support the struggle for peace." Li Haoran, representative of the Korean Democratic Front, said: "We must stop the Japanese army from participating in the Korean War." In his speech, Zenjiro Yamada, representative of the Kazuo Luchi Rescue Association, reported on the atrocities of American agents kidnapping Kazuo Luchi, and exposed the conspiracy of the American invaders to transport captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to Japan for special training, preparing to force them to serve as special agents and spies in northern Korea. This shocking revelation aroused great anger among all the delegates. The congress passed a resolution to protest to the United States and expose the truth of the matter to the people of the world. Representatives from groups such as the Preparatory Committee for the World Women's Peace Congress, the National Relief Association, and the Socialist Party Reconstruction Liaison Council also spoke in succession.
    At this point, the congress entered the reports of peace movements in various regions. The first to report was Toyota of the Hokkaido University Faculty and Staff Union, who reported on the recent developments in the Hokkaido peace movement, pointing out that the Hokkaido peace movement is gradually moving from dispersion to unity, and the peace organizations in various places are not only increasing their mutual connections, but also have the demand to establish a regional peace movement liaison organization. More than 300 representatives from various places participated in the Regional Peace Conference held on February 28th; more than 600 representatives attended the Hokkaido People's Congress for Peace held in Sapporo on March 15th. At that congress, important resolutions were made, such as immediately stopping the Korean War and Asians never fighting Asians.
    The first day of the congress was then adjourned. After the meeting, all the delegates watched the films "The Road to Peace" and "Bacterial Warfare."
    Before continuing the regional reports on the second day, a congratulatory message from Shigeharu Yoshida, Chairman of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, was read. In his congratulatory message, he described the tasks of the workers in the peace movement, and expressed his regret that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan did not participate in this congress.
    Matsumoto, the representative of the Kyushu Regional Peace Liaison Conference, pointed out in his report that Kyushu is the closest to the Korean battlefield and has the most military bases, so the people's desire for peace is also the strongest. He said that in Fukuoka, there is a huge military base network centered on Itazuke Airport, and the roar of aircraft continues day and night, making it impossible for schools to hold classes. A junior high school student was injured by a bullet fired from an aircraft, and the government only paid 600 yen in compensation. Currently, the people of Kyushu are launching a movement to demand the removal of all military bases in Kyushu. Since the All Kyushu Regional Peace Conference was held in Aso last November, the Kyushu peace movement has been rising day by day. Representatives from Nagasaki, Oita, Moribara and other cities and prefectures also made supplementary reports.
    Following this, peace representatives from Shikoku, Chugoku, Kansai, Chubu, Hokuriku, Kanto, and Tohoku reported on the peace movements in their respective regions. From these reports, it can be seen that the Japanese people's movement for peace is rapidly expanding and developing.
    After all the reports were completed, the congress proceeded to discussions. Before starting the discussions, the congress unanimously adopted the three discussion principles proposed by Chairman Kenjiro Yanagida: do not discuss political and ideological issues that are not directly related to the peace movement; everyone has full freedom of speech, and the voting must be unanimous, and no resolution will be made if there is one dissenting vote; fully listen to opposing views. After detailed democratic discussions, the congress finally unanimously adopted eight important resolutions, including demanding the immediate cessation of the Korean War and Asians never fighting Asians, as well as two documents: "Letter to the People of All Countries" and "Letter to All the Japanese People."
    Chairman Kazuo Matsuura summarized two directions for effort: (1) We should use persuasion to strive for a wider range of Japanese people to participate in the struggle to defend peace; (2) The peace movement is an arduous task, and every peace advocate must fully take on this great task; peace organizations in various places should strengthen cooperation and strive for common goals.
    Ikuo Oyama said with great excitement: "Thirty years ago, when we fought against imperialism, we were still a minority, and almost in a state of despair; but today, the forces striving for peace have become the majority and a movement of the whole people. This shows that the blood of the martyrs starting with Seiji Yamamoto has not been shed in vain. We are here today to meet victoriously and should express our gratitude to hundreds and thousands of martyrs. The two days of discussion were full of the spirit of democracy. I hope everyone will fight to the end for the realization of this resolution. I am also determined to fight to the end together with everyone." All the delegates responded to his call with lasting applause.
    After Chaoya Ito, the representative of the Kyoto Peace Conference, delivered the closing remarks, Ikuo Oyama led all the delegates in chanting "Long live peace!" three times. This historically significant congress was declared a victorious end amidst deafening cheers.

    日本人民争取和平大会纪实
    经过长时间的筹备，“日本人民争取和平大会”于三月二十一日在东京中央区筑地的“京桥公会堂”开幕，二十二日胜利结束。经过这次和平大会，日本人民的和平运动向前大大迈进了一步。
    这次大会有六百位代表出席，他们来自三十九个不同的都、道、府、县；仅北海道一地即有四十位代表参加。这些代表们代表着各地区不同阶层、不同职业、不同信仰、不同政治见解的爱好和平的日本人民。
    会场布置庄严朴素。主席台的背后是一巨幅毕加索的“和平鸽”，上面悬着大会的口号“商谈和平”，两旁排列着各种文字的“和平”剪贴字。充满着和平的气氛。
    大会开始，选出了日本拥护和平委员会主席大山郁夫、委员柳田谦十郎、北海道的小笠原贞子、冈山县的吉冈、九州的吉田和私营铁路工会联合会的田村为主席团（大会进行中又补选了日苏亲善协会的尾形昭二、民主妇女协议会的栉田吹和著名学者松浦一教授三人为主席团），便开始进行大会的议程。
    首先由曾到北京出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表樱井英雄报告他在中国的见闻，他令人兴奋地叙述了新中国的各种新气象，特别强调中国人民爱好和平的热情。他的报告受到全体代表热烈的欢迎。
    接着是曾到中国洽商日侨归国问题的平野义太郎作了关于中国的日本侨民归国问题的报告。他指责吉田政府处处与人民中国为敌，而不关心这种战后的善后工作，当日本人民的代表担当起协助侨民归国的任务的时候，吉田政府却多方阻挠，而且企图对归国侨胞进行思想调查和追问情报等迫害。接着他历述中国政府和人民团体对日侨归国所给予的无微不至的关怀与援助，使人深深感动。
    日本和平联络委员会事务局局长畑中政春并作了补充的报告。他大声疾呼：“现在是日本人民必须自己起来的时候了，只有爱好和平的人民才能得到中国人民的信任。”他最后说：“今年秋天我们一定要迎接中国红十字会代表来日本，明年我们要派遣媾和的代表团到中国去。”他的话博得全场的鼓掌。
    “在华同胞归国协力会”的代表宫崎世民讲话，他说，吉田政府已禁止日本和平联络委员会等三团体在舞鹤设立办事处办理归侨事宜，我们必须用人民的力量来贯彻这一要求。
    这时候因事来迟的日本和平领袖大山郁夫到场，他获得全体代表的热烈欢迎。他在如雷的掌声中走上讲台说：“我很高兴能够和来自全国各地的和平代表见面。不管是那一次集会，我们都不能忘怀在我们背后的广大群众。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议有十亿以上人民的支持，去年十二月在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会有二十亿人民支持。你们是代表了几百万群众而来的。不管政治见解和信仰，只要是赞成和平的，我们都欢迎参加。”他指出日本和平运动在整个世界和平运动中所占的重要地位，他说：“我们应该把对于美国是重要的日本军事基地变成为人类的和平基地。全世界的人民都对我们怀着这样的希望，我们必须给予他们满意的回答。”全场以热烈的鼓掌表示响应他的号召。最后他并指出，即将举行的大选是日本人民进行争取和平斗争的一个机会，应当号召爱好和平的人民彻底击败吉田及企图代替吉田上台公开进行重新武装的鸠山和重光。他并表示：“我将和大家一道为此斗争到底。”掌声历久不息。
    披着袈裟的中山理理法师代表日本佛教联合会报告“花冈事件”的经过。他叙述了日本军国主义分子战时在日本秋田县花冈矿山大批虐杀被俘的中国士兵和被强征的中国工人的血腥暴行，并说明日本各人民团体准备联合于四月一日追悼殉难的中国烈士。他要求人民协助把骨灰运送回中国。他的发言使代表们深受感动。
    继由立川市的代表报告该地人民由于美国修筑军事基地而遭受的苦难。当他说到当地居民因为汽油流进水井和河川而弄得无水可吃的时候，他拿出了从立川带来的一勺井水，当众点火燃烧。这说明了今天的日本人民受到军事基地化的灾害的惨状。他号召大家加强反对建筑军事基地的斗争。
    下午继续开会。帆足计畅谈他访问苏联的印象，他以在苏联这一个伟大的爱好和平的国家里看到的具体事实，揭穿了日本反动派所散布的诬蔑苏联的谎言。曾到中国洽商中日贸易问题的宫腰喜助报告“贸易问题”，斥责吉田政府的战争政策使得日本的贸易陷于极悲惨的状况；指出日本人民是渴望进行中日贸易的，日本政府不能违反人民的意志。出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的代表淡德三郎详尽地传达了世界人民和平大会的决议，指出日本和平运动的明确方向。
    大会在宣读了各国和平组织给大会的贺电之后，由日本各民主团体代表致词。劳农党的代表堀真琴说：“我们要与重新武装日本的阴谋进行坚决的斗争。”日中友好协会的代表小泽正元说：“三万归国的同胞加强了我们的和平力量。”日苏亲善协会的代表堀江品一说：“我们必须为粉碎反苏反共的宣传而斗争！”日本共产党的代表岩间政男说：“为争取撤除日本的军事基地而进行坚决斗争，是符合广大日本人民的愿望的。”残废军人团体中央联合会的代表高桥清刚说：“在第二次世界大战中受伤的残废军人坚决支持争取和平的斗争。”朝鲜民主战线的代表李浩然说：“必须制止日本军队参加朝鲜战争。”鹿地山田救援会的代表山田善二郎在致词中除了报告美国特务绑架鹿地亘的暴行之外，并揭露了美国侵略者把朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员押运到日本进行特务训练，准备强迫他们到朝鲜北部充当特务间谍的阴谋活动。他的这一惊人的揭发，激起了全体代表的极大愤怒，大会通过决定，对美国提出抗议，并将此事真相向全世界人民揭露。相继致词的还有参加世界妇女和平大会筹备会、国民救援会、社会党再建联络会等团体的代表。
    至此，大会进入了各地区和平运动的报告。第一个作报告的是北海道大学教职员工会的丰田，他报告了北海道和平运动发展的近况，指出北海道的和平运动正逐渐从分散走向统一，各地方的和平组织不仅相互间的联系日趋密切，而且都有成立全道的和平运动联络组织的要求。二月二十八日举行的全道和平会议，各地有三百多名代表参加；三月十五日在札幌举行的全道人民和平大会，出席的代表达六百多人。在那次大会中作出了立即停止朝鲜战争、亚洲人绝对不和亚洲人作战等重要决议。
    第一天的大会至此宣告休会。会后，全体代表看了“和平之路”和“细菌战”两个影片。
    第二天在继续进行地方报告之前，宣读了全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治的祝词，他在祝词中叙述了工人在和平运动中的任务，并对日本工会总评议会没有参加本次大会表示遗憾。
    九州地方的和平联络会议代表松本在报告中指出：九州离朝鲜战场最近，军事基地最多，因此人民对于要求和平的愿望也最强烈。他说，在福冈有以板付机场为中心的庞大军事基地网，飞机吼叫之声昼夜不停，学校也无法上课。中学生被飞机打出来的枪弹打伤了，政府只付了六百元赔偿费了事。目前九州的人民正展开要求撤除九州所有军事基地的运动。自从去年十一月在阿苏召开的全九州地方和平大会以后，九州的和平运动正日益高涨。长崎、大分、森原等市、县的代表并作了补充的报告。
    接着，四国地方、中国地方、关西地方、中部地方、北陆地方、关东地方、东北地方的和平代表相继报告了各地和平运动的情况，从这些报告中可以知道日本人民争取和平的运动正在迅速扩大和发展。
    各项报告完毕后，大会进行讨论。开始讨论之前，全场一致通过了主席柳田谦十郎提出的三项讨论原则：不讨论与和平运动无直接关系的政治思想问题；每人有充分发言的自由，表决必须是一致通过，有一票反对的均不作决议；充分听取反对的意见。经过详细的民主讨论，大会最后一致通过了要求立即停止朝鲜战争、亚洲人绝对不和亚洲人作战等八项重要决议，以及“告世界各国人民书”与“告全体日本人民书”两个文件。
    主席松浦一总结出两点努力的方向：（一）应该以说服的方式，争取更广泛的日本人民参加到保卫和平的斗争里来；（二）和平运动是一项艰巨的任务，每一个和平拥护者必须全力把这伟大的任务担当起来；各地和平组织要加强合作，为共同的目标而奋斗。
    大山郁夫无限兴奋地致词说：“三十年前，我们进行反对帝国主义的斗争的时候，还是少数派，而且几乎处于绝望的境地；而今天争取和平的力量已成为多数派，成为全民的运动。这说明了以山本宣治开始的牺牲者的血并没有白流。我们今天在此胜利地会合，应对成百成千的牺牲者表示感激。两天的讨论充满了民主的精神，希望大家为这个决议的实现而斗争到底。我也有和大家共同斗争到底的决心。”全体代表以经久不息的掌声回答他的号召。
    在京都和平会议的代表伊藤今朝弥致闭幕词后，大山郁夫领导全体代表三呼“和平万岁！”有历史意义的这一次大会在响彻云霄的欢呼声中宣告胜利结束。
