    The Growth of a Miao Female Deputy County Head
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Peng Fengye
    Xiang Biying, a Miao woman who lived in the high mountains for thirty years and endured a long period of enslaved poverty, is now the Deputy County Head of the Bijie County People's Government in Guizhou Province. Her three-year journey of growth fully demonstrates that, under the cultivation and education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, women of ethnic minorities, like cadres of other ethnicities, can fully utilize their wisdom and talents to serve the people of all ethnic groups.
    Xiang Biying grew up on Gaojia Mountain in Zhonggou Village, Bijie County. Zhonggou Village has more mountains than farmland, and Gaojia Mountain is particularly cold. The six Miao families living on the mountain were even poorer than other families in the village. Xiang Biying's father died of illness when she was only six months old, and her mother supported the frail infant by working as a hired hand. From the age of eight, she herded more than thirty goats for a Han landlord in the village. At the age of seventeen, she married a fellow ethnic tenant farmer, and they continued to live on "buckwheat cakes mixed with fern roots." However, the Kuomintang reactionary rulers' cruel oppression did not spare this remote mountainous area. Xiang Biying's family had to pay extra burdens such as "military conscription fees" and "household money" every month, and her husband was even conscripted into the Kuomintang army once. Local bullies and bandits sometimes came to the mountains to plunder and rob, and in order to save the only two sheng of corn seeds in her home, she had to hide in the mountains day and night, "unable to return home even when there was one." Xiang Biying endured such hardship for thirty years.
    In the early days of Guizhou's liberation, local bullies and bandits in Zhonggou Village, such as Shao Zhangliang, infiltrated the village government and farmers' association at the time and continued to oppress the people. The Miao people of Gaojia Mountain, where Xiang Biying lived, were excluded from the household registration, and they had not yet been liberated. It was not until the work team arrived in the village that they saw the light of day. From then on, the village launched a "suppression of bandits and elimination of bullies" campaign. With the enlightenment and help of the work team, the Miao people began to understand the Communist Party's policy of ethnic equality. Xiang Biying had personally suffered exploitation and oppression by bandits like Shao Zhangliang. For the sake of her own happy life, she joined the people of all ethnic groups in the village to persist in the struggle and dug out the stolen goods that the bandits had robbed from the people of all ethnic groups. In this way, the bandits Shao Zhangliang and others were purged from the village government and punished by the people. Due to her active work, Xiang Biying was elected as the women's affairs committee member by the villagers.
    On "March 8th" International Women's Day in 1951, Xiang Biying met the people's district head at the commemoration meeting. Encouraged by the district head, she stepped onto the stage for the first time and spoke of the joy of the Miao women in the year since liberation. Xiang Biying recalled the situation at the time: "I was a Miao woman who had suffered oppression for a long time, illiterate, and had never spoken in public before. However, thanks to the district head's respect and encouragement for us women, I had a lot to say."
    Under the cultivation of the People's Government, Xiang Biying grew day by day in her practical work. She once represented the women of the village to attend the Bijie County Congress of People from All Ethnic Groups. Using the respect she personally received, she helped the Miao people improve their understanding, persuaded many ethnic minorities who were afraid to attend meetings to participate in political activities regularly.
    When the Bijie County Ethnic Minority Democratic United Government was established, Xiang Biying was elected as a government member. At this time, the county was carrying out land reform. Xiang Biying went to work in Dadu Village, where the ethnic situation was more complex. Like Zhonggou Village a year ago, the people of all ethnic groups could not be mobilized under the rule of local bullies and landlords. Xiang Biying went deep among the people and introduced the situation of Zhonggou Village and her own personal experience to the people of all ethnic groups; at the same time, with the help and leadership of the Bijie County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, she purged the bad people in power, and the people of all ethnic groups were thus educated, and the work proceeded smoothly.
    Last year, when the Southwest Ethnic Minority Visiting Group came to the capital of the motherland to visit, Xiang Biying represented the Miao women of Guizhou and came to Beijing from the remote mountains. This visit was truly fruitful. In Xiang Biying's words: "Listening to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions and Chairman Ulanhu's report of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the capital made me further realize the equal rights of ethnic minorities to be masters of their own affairs and the importance of ethnic work." After returning to Bijie, she used practical actions to convey the gains of the visit.
    After Xiang Biying returned to the district, she went from one village to another, talking about mutual aid and cooperation, machine production, and the equal unity and happy prospects of the people of all ethnic groups. However, improving production must start from the current environment and conditions. In her hometown of Zhonggou Village, the most difficult and needed problem was water conservancy. Under her leadership, the people of all ethnic groups actively dug and repaired canals, allowing many mountainous areas that originally grew corn to be irrigated and planted with rice.
    Xiang Biying cares about the vital interests of the poor people and is loved by the people of all ethnic groups. In September of last year, she was promoted to Deputy County Head of the Bijie County People's Government. Later, she and the secretary of the Bijie County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party jointly ran five training classes for peasant activists, and these people became the backbone of developing production. Xiang Biying also became more robust in her work.
    Now, Xiang Biying represents the women of all ethnic groups in Bijie County for the second time to participate in the Second National Women's Congress of China in Beijing. In the "Peace Hotel" building, she told me about her past experiences. She said excitedly: "It is truly unimaginable that a Miao woman like me, who has lived in a remote mountainous area for a long time, can now do things for the people of all ethnic groups and represent the Miao women to say what they want to say. However, under the education and leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have indeed become the masters of our own affairs. I am still very naive and need the cultivation of the Communist Party."
    Xiang Biying wrote an application to join the Party in November of last year and made a plan to join the Party. She said: She wants to temper herself in work and strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.

    一个苗族女副县长的成长
    新华社记者  彭逢烨
    三十年来，住在高山上，过着长期的被奴役的贫困生活的苗族妇女项毕英，现在已是贵州省毕节县人民政府的副县长了。她三年来成长的历程，充分说明了少数民族妇女在中国共产党和人民政府的培养教育下，也像其他的民族干部一样，完全可以发挥她们的智慧和才能，为各族人民服务。
    项毕英生长在毕节县中沟村的高家山上。中沟村山多田少，高家山尤其寒冷，住在山上的六家苗族人民，比村里其他人家的生活还要贫苦。项毕英出生才六个月，父亲就在贫病中死去，母亲背着孱弱的婴儿，佣工度日。从八岁开始，她就替村里的汉族地主放牧三十几只山羊了。十七岁那年，她和同族的一个雇农结了婚，过的日子仍旧是“荞麦粑粑拌蕨草根”。但是，国民党反动统治者的残酷压迫，对这一个边远的山区并不例外，项毕英家里每月都有“送兵费”、“门户钱”等额外负担，她的丈夫还给国民党拉了一次兵。恶霸、土匪有时还要到山上搜刮、抢劫，她为了保存家里仅有的两升玉米种，只好白天夜里往山林中躲，“有家也归不得”。项毕英就是在这样苦难的日子中，一天天地挨过了三十年。
    贵州解放初期，中沟村的恶霸、土匪邵章亮等潜入了当时的村政权和农会组织中，仍旧欺压人民。项毕英所住的高家山的苗族人民，被列在户口之外，他们还没有得到解放。直到工作队到村后，他们才得见了天日。从那以后，村里开展“清匪反霸”的斗争，苗族人民在工作队的启发帮助下，开始明白共产党的民族平等政策。项毕英曾亲身遭受土匪邵章亮等的剥削压迫，为了自己的幸福生活，她和全村的各族人民一道，坚持斗争，把土匪抢劫各族人民的脏物，从地里挖掘出来。土匪邵章亮等就这样从村政权中清洗了出去，并受到人民的惩罚。项毕英由于工作积极，被全村人民选为妇女委员。
    一九五一年“三八”节，项毕英在纪念会上遇见人民的区长，在区长的鼓舞下，她第一次走上讲台，说出解放一年来苗族妇女的喜悦。项毕英回忆当时的情境说：“我一个长期遭受压迫的苗族妇女，不识字，也没有讲过话，但是，就凭区长对我们妇女的尊重和鼓励，我就有许多话要说。”
    项毕英在人民政府的培养下，在实际工作中一天天成长起来。她曾经代表过村里的妇女出席了毕节县的各族各界代表会议，用她亲身受到的尊重，帮助苗族人民提高了认识，说服了许多不敢出来开会的少数民族人民，经常参加政治活动。
    毕节县民族民主联合政府成立时，项毕英被选为政府委员。这时，全县正开展土地改革。项毕英到民族情况比较复杂的大渡村去工作。大渡村像一年前的中沟村一样，各族人民在恶霸地主的统治下，发动不起来。项毕英深入到人民中，把中沟村的情况和她自己的切身体验，介绍给各族人民；同时，在中共毕节县委员会的帮助领导下，把当权的坏人清洗了，各族人民因此受到教育，工作顺利地展开了。
    去年西南少数民族参观团到祖国的首都来参观时，项毕英代表贵州苗族妇女，从遥远的山区，来到了北京。这一次参观的收获真不小。用项毕英的话说：“在首都听到了朱总司令的指示和内蒙古自治区乌兰夫主席的报告，使我进一步认识了少数民族当家做主的平等权利，和民族工作的重要。”在回到毕节以后，她用实际行动传达了参观的收获。
    项毕英回到区上，从一个村到另一个村，讲互助合作，讲机器生产，讲各族人民的平等团结和幸福远景。但是，改进生产必须从眼前的环境和条件出发。在她的家乡中沟村最感困难和需要的问题是水利，在她的带动下，各族人民积极挖修水渠，使许多原来种玉米的山地，得到水的灌溉，种上了稻谷。
    项毕英关心贫苦人民的切身利益，受到各族人民的爱护。去年九月间，她被提拔为毕节县人民政府的副县长。以后，她和中共毕节县委会的秘书共同负责，开办了五期农民积极分子训练班，这些人都成为发展生产中的骨干，项毕英在工作中也更锻炼得结实了。
    现在，项毕英代表毕节县的各族妇女第二次到北京来参加中国第二次全国妇女代表大会，在“和平宾馆”的大楼里，她对我讲述了过往的经历。她兴奋地说：“像我这样一个长期住在边远山区里的苗族妇女，今天竟能够为各族人民做事，代表苗族妇女说自己要说的话，真是不能想像的事。但是，在共产党和毛主席的教育、领导下，我们确实是当了家、做了主。我还很幼稚，还需要共产党的培育。”
    项毕英在去年十一月写了入党申请书，并订出入党的计划，她说：要在工作中锻炼，争取做一个光荣的共产党员。
