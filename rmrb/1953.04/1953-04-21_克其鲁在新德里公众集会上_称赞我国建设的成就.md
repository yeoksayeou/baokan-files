    克其鲁在新德里公众集会上
    称赞我国建设的成就
    【新华社新德里二十日电】德里印中友好协会十六日晚在新德里市政厅召开公众集会。全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁博士在会上发表演说，谈他访问新中国的观感。克其鲁曾率领印度代表团出席一九五二年十月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，会后并在中国进行了访问。
    克其鲁对新中国的伟大成就备加称赞。他说：“在中国发生了一个奇迹。看来这好像是梦一样。”他说：“在任何地方，我所遇见的中国人民都以极大的热情和忘我的劳动，忙于建设他们自己的国家。”克其鲁强调说：“所有这些，使我受到很大的感动。中国确实要和平，中国要实行它的建设计划，中国不要战争。”
    谈到信仰宗教自由的问题时，克其鲁博士对听众说：他曾在中国会晤过回教徒。他们对他说，他们在目前的人民政府领导下，感到心满意足。他们得到人民政府的充分保护和支持，他们在各种事务上都享有完全平等的权利。
    克其鲁还谈到中印两国人民的历史悠久的友好关系。他指出：这种友谊在今天更加需要，因为它对维护和平是有帮助的。
