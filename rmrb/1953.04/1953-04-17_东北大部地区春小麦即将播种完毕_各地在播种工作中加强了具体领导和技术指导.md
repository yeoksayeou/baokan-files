According to reports from our reporter Fang Qing and correspondents from various parts of Northeast China: Farmers in various parts of Northeast China are intensively sowing wheat. Most areas of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe had basically completed sowing around Qingming (April 5th); Jilin and Heilongjiang will be able to finish sowing by April 15th; and Songjiang Province will be able to finish sowing around April 20th. The province with the largest wheat acreage is Heilongjiang, which plans to sow a total of 580,000 hectares this year (including the sown area of state-owned farms).

This year, various localities in Northeast China have generally strengthened specific leadership for wheat sowing. Based on the specific situation of the spring drought, they actively mobilized advanced mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to take the lead in plowing, promoting the majority of farmers to start plowing and sowing early. The southern provinces generally started plowing in mid-March, and the northern provinces generally started plowing in late March, both more than ten days earlier than in previous years. As early as around March 20th, when the ground had just thawed, state-owned mechanized farms, demonstration farms, and some rural areas in Keshan, Longjiang, and other counties in Heilongjiang Province had already begun sowing. If it didn't thaw in the morning, they would sow in the afternoon; if the backslope land didn't thaw, they would sow on the sunny slope land first; they tried every means to gain time. By the beginning of April, more than 200 tractors and 1,500 horse-drawn ten-row seeders, as well as old-fashioned wooden plows scattered throughout the vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, had all been put into operation, forming a high tide of wheat sowing.

This year, various localities in Northeast China have generally paid attention to improving cultivation techniques and promoting the method of uniform dense sowing in wheat sowing. The Chahayang Mechanized Farm and some demonstration farms adopted a sowing method with a row spacing of 7.5 centimeters (connecting the front and rear of a seeder with a row spacing of 15 centimeters for re-sowing). The row spacing of horse-drawn ten-row seeders is still 15 centimeters, but most have increased the seeds to 180 kg to 200 kg per hectare, which is one-third higher than the density of sowing with old farm tools in the past. Various localities have also studied methods for implementing dense sowing on the basis of using old farm tools. When promoting dense planting, many areas paid attention to finding examples of increased production through dense planting in the past to carry out publicity, and gradually promoted it by organizing field demonstrations and visits. Cadres from the Agricultural Section of the Tai'an County People's Government observed the changes in temperature every day from March 7th, organized advanced mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to check and inspect the soil moisture, check the depth of soil thawing, and carry out sowing in a timely manner; at the same time, they organized nearby farmers to visit, introducing experience while leading them to watch, so that they dispelled incorrect ideas such as "widening the sowing width will not seal the ridges" and "dense sowing is labor-intensive." In the process of sowing wheat, demonstration farms in Dehui and other counties, agricultural technical guidance stations in Hailun, Suihua, and the suburbs of Shenyang, and other places have played a technical guidance role, and timely taught the masses of farmers the methods of dense planting and seed disinfection. More than one-quarter of the sown wheat in Yushu County was leveled with new farm tools; more than one-quarter was sown using the more advanced method of planting five seedlings in three ridges; and more than one-fifth was mixed with Seresan for sowing.

    东北大部地区春小麦即将播种完毕
    各地在播种工作中加强了具体领导和技术指导
    据本报记者方青和东北各地通讯员报道：东北各地农民正在紧张地播种小麦。辽东、辽西、热河大部分地方在清明（四月五日）前后已经基本上播种完毕；吉林、黑龙江在四月十五日可以种完；松江省在四月二十日左右可以种完。种麦面积较大的是黑龙江省，今年计划种麦共五十八万公顷（国营农场播种面积计算在内）。
    今年东北各地对于种麦一般地都加强了具体领导，根据春旱的具体情况，积极动员先进的互助组、农业生产合作社带头开犁，推动了广大农民提早开犁播种。南部各省在三月中旬普遍开犁，北部各省在三月下旬普遍开犁，都比往年提早了十几天。早在三月二十日前后，大地刚刚解冻，黑龙江省的国营机械农场、示范农场以及克山、龙江等县的部分农村就已经开始播种了。上午不解冻，就下午种；背坡地不解冻，就先在阳坡地种；想尽一切办法赢得时间。到四月初，黑龙江省境内的二百多台拖拉机和散布在广大农村的一千五百台马拉十行播种机以及旧式木犁，就已经全部出动，形成了种麦的高潮。
    今年东北各地在种麦中一般都注意了改进耕作技术，推广了均匀密播的方法。查哈阳机械农场和一部分示范农场采用了行距七点五公分的播法（把行距十五公分的播种机前后连结重播）。马拉十行播种机播种的行距仍为十五公分，但大都把籽种增加到每公顷一百八十公斤到二百公斤，比以前用旧农具播种的密度增加了三分之一。各地还研究了在使用旧农具的基础上实行密播的办法。在推行密植时，许多地区注意了寻找当地过去密植增产的实例进行宣传，用田间表演组织参观的方法逐步推广。台安县人民政府农业科的干部，从三月七日起就逐日观察气温变化情形，组织先进的互助组、农业生产合作社查墒、验墒，检查土地解冻的深度，及时进行播种；同时组织附近农民参观，一边领着他们看一边介绍经验，使他们打消了“加宽播幅就封不上垄”“密播费工”等不正确思想。在播种小麦的过程中，德惠等县的示范农场，海伦、绥化和沈阳市郊等地的农业技术指导站，都发挥了技术指导作用，及时教给了农民群众密植和种籽消毒的方法。榆树县已播的小麦，有四分之一以上是用新农具平作的；有四分之一以上是用三条垄种五个苗眼的较先进的办法播种的；有五分之一以上用赛力散拌了种。
