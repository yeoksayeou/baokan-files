    On the First Volume of the Junior Middle School Textbook "Chinese History"
    Qi Xia
    The current "Chinese History" (Volume 1) textbook used in junior middle schools was compiled by Comrades Li Gengxu and Wang Zhibai. According to feedback from teachers, this textbook is much better than the ones used previously; however, it still has many shortcomings that must be vigorously improved.
    It is necessary for the textbook to have a clear arrangement and narrative of the social economy, politics, and culture of each period. However, because the textbook lacks in-depth analysis of many important issues, the social economy, politics, and culture become a mere list of phenomena without organic connections. Here, we will cite three types of examples to illustrate.
    I. The textbook does not sufficiently explain how the base determines the superstructure. As everyone knows, in the early Western Zhou feudal society, land was occupied by the large and small nobles, such as the Zhou king, the dukes, and the senior officials, after repeated divisions. On this economic basis of land ownership, feudal states of varying sizes were established. Besides tributes (which the textbook calls "contributions"), the Zhou king and the dukes, and the dukes and the senior officials maintained their respective independent situations in terms of economy and politics. The textbook not only fails to comprehensively present these characteristics but also fails to explain the repeated division of political power with the characteristics of this economic base. It does not point out that tribute, as one of the basic feudal relations of this period, was an important source of internal conflicts within each state and wars between them. In this way, it is impossible for people to clearly understand the difference between the feudal separatist system and the later feudal centralized system, and the essence of the great powers vying for hegemony during the Spring and Autumn Period.
    II. The textbook does not sufficiently explain the reaction of the superstructure on the base. Although the textbook points out the development of social productive forces and the emergence of the new landlord class during the Spring and Autumn Period, it does not point out the important significance of the reforms of Marquis Wen of Wei and the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the section "The Chaos of the Seven Kingdoms and the Unification of Qin." These changes cleared the obstacles for the advancement of the emerging landlord class. They were a significant sign of the rise and fall of the old feudal lords and the emerging landlord forces. They were a sign that the emerging landlord class began to use the power of the superstructure to consolidate its economic base. Without this narrative, people would have no way of knowing how the emerging landlord class replaced the old feudal lords and stepped onto the political stage.
    III. The textbook does not sufficiently explain the relationship between productive forces and relations of production. Looking at the old lord ownership system, the peasant (i.e., serf) had to use his own tools and spend a lot of time working on the lord's "public land" before he could cultivate the "private land" designated by the lord for his own use. This inevitably created this contradiction: the peasant was not very interested in cultivating the "public land," but he was very interested in cultivating the "private land," and at the same time, he felt that the "private land" was not enough to use. Therefore, in the late Western Zhou period, the phenomenon of "weeds growing luxuriantly" and neglecting weeding occurred on the public land. After the development of productive forces in the Spring and Autumn Period, this contradiction became increasingly large, and the peasant's demand for insufficient "private land" became increasingly urgent. This is how the relations of production became unsuitable for the nature of the productive forces, and this situation was in urgent need of change.
    The contradiction between the peasants and the lords under this circumstance shook the foundation of the lords' rule, and the frequent wars of annexation between the lords further accelerated the collapse of this foundation. Therefore, in this historical process, the lower strata of the aristocracy—the scholars, some commoners, and merchants—gained economic and political status that they did not have before. In order to consolidate their positions and expand their positions, these people had to make concessions to the peasants and meet some of their demands. Therefore, they abandoned labor rent and adopted rent in kind. Under this transformation of the form of exploitation (which is still feudal in essence),
    "The direct producer has some control over all of his own labor time, although a part of this labor time (formerly the entirety of the surplus) now belongs without compensation, as before, to the landowner" (Capital, Volume 3, page 679). But it solved the previous basic contradiction to some extent. In this way, the former serf transformed into a farmer, and these new landowners were the emerging landlords. From the opening up of forests into fields in the Spring and Autumn Period to Li Kui's teaching of "exhausting the land's power" and Shang Yang's "opening up the paths between fields," it was because the relations of production of this land ownership system were suitable for the nature of the productive forces that the social economy developed.
    In addition, some lords also transformed into emerging landlords due to the development of the new situation. The announcement of the "initial tax on fields" by the State of Lu in 594 BC is an example.
    According to the textbook, the lords' land was transferred to new figures, and these figures were the emerging landlords. This is not looking at the issue from the perspective of changes in the content of the relations of production. According to the textbook, "the lords and the emerging landlords, in order to extract more harvests from the serfs and peasants and prevent the serfs from slacking off on the public land, simply stopped dividing public land and private land, rented all the land to the peasants for cultivation, and collected a certain amount of harvest as rent." The lords and the emerging landlords are no different, and the changes of the two classes of serfs and peasants are nowhere to be found.
    Because the textbook does not clearly understand many basic issues, the analysis and criticism of historical figures cannot be correct and appropriate. This issue can also be discussed in the following two situations.
    First: The textbook does not praise the figures who used violent means and carried out many wars, such as Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han. The textbook narrates some of the deeds of Qin Shi Huang, saying before his deeds: "He (referring to Qin Shi Huang) used force to end the chaos of more than 500 years and established the first centralized feudal empire in the history of our country." After his deeds, it says: "After Qin Shi Huang ended the situation of the Warring States, he used autocratic and tyrannical means to establish a unified centralized feudal empire." However, it does not go on to affirm Qin Shi Huang's great role in unifying China and call him a meritorious figure. It also said a lot about the deeds of Emperor Wu of Han, but it did not say that he was a heroic figure based on the actual situation of Emperor Wu of Han. Based on this situation, and looking at the textbook's statement on the wars of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods—that they were "wars of annexation and plunder"—it can be said that the textbook is afraid that affirming such figures is affirming violence and war. Obviously, the textbook's understanding of violence and war in history is also not thorough enough.
    It should be pointed out that Marxism acknowledges that violence has a certain role in history. Marxism does not oppose all wars. For violence and war, Marxism examines them within their certain historical scope and the consequences they produce. Lenin said: "The difference between us Marxists and the pacifists and anarchists is that we advocate the need to historically (['historically' is viewed from the Marxist dialectical materialist viewpoint]) analyze the nature of each war. Historically, there are some wars that, despite all their horrors, cruelty, poverty, and suffering—these are inevitably linked to every war—are still progressive, that is, beneficial to human evolution..." ("Socialism and War")
    The wars of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were indeed "wars of annexation and plunder," which brought great suffering to the people. However, the transition from the fragmented separatist rule of the dukes to a unified centralized state could only be accomplished through war. Engels once said that feudal warfare is "a necessary and legitimate stage" in the formation of a centralized state. Therefore, for these wars, it is necessary to estimate the consequences they produced and affirm their role in this regard.
    Solving this problem, for figures like Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han who have used violence and carried out many wars, it is necessary to give them a certain historical status based on their main contributions.
    Second: The textbook's criticism of the rulers who established unified feudal states after peasant wars, such as Liu Bang and Liu Xiu, is also not pertinent enough.
    According to the textbook: "Liu Bang was from a hooligan background. He understood the people's desire for peace and also understood the landlord class's demand for maintaining order." Just imagine, how could a wandering hooligan understand the people's desire for peace? And how could he understand the landlord class's demand for maintaining order? It should be said that Liu Bang was the leader of the peasant uprising. He understood the people's desire for peace. But in the process of the peasant war achieving victory, Liu Bang transformed into a landlord, so he understood the landlord class's demand for maintaining order.
    The textbook calls Liu Xiu a big landlord who organized landlord armed forces and "took the opportunity to mix into the ranks of the uprising peasants." That's right, Liu Xiu was indeed a big landlord. But the armed forces he organized were used to resist Wang Mang. He and the other peasant armies were completely united in the single goal of opposing the Wang Mang regime. His and his armed forces' joining the peasant army was beneficial to the peasant army. History proves that Liu Xiu played an important role in the "Battle of Kunyang" in the New Han Dynasty, enabling the peasant war to achieve a decisive victory. Since this is the case, Liu Xiu did not undermine the peasant war against the Wang Mang regime, so there is obviously no need to say that he "took the opportunity to mix into the ranks of the uprising peasants."
    From these two examples, it can be seen that the textbook is afraid of making mistakes by speaking too well of Liu Bang and Liu Xiu because they are emperors, so it criticizes them with some vulgar arguments. This is completely unnecessary. The unified feudal regime established after the peasant war can be said to be a product of the victory of the peasant war. Therefore, for the founders of such unified regimes, whether they were from a landlord background or some figures who were from a peasant background and transformed into landlords, the focus of our criticism should be placed on this aspect, to see whether they made concessions to the peasants and whether they played a role in promoting social development. Without starting from these arguments, it is impossible to reach correct conclusions.
    These are the basic problems of the textbook, and errors in the use and interpretation of historical materials are not included. In addition, the textbook should also supplement some content, such as population figures that are sufficient to illustrate the economic development and contraction of a certain period. Sufficient space should be given to Wang Chong, a great philosopher of the Eastern Han Dynasty who had a simple materialist thought.
    As for the future improvement of the textbook, first of all, the editors should redouble their efforts to improve their theory and master their profession. They should also carefully listen to the opinions of some experienced teachers in order to learn about the specific circumstances such as the size of the textbook, the depth of the content, and the problems encountered in the implementation of teaching, as a reference for improving the textbook.

    关于初级中学课本“中国历史”（第一册）
    漆侠
    目前初级中学所采用的“中国历史”（第一册）课本，是由李赓序、王芝九两位同志编写的。据一般教师反应，这个课本较前此所使用的是好了许多的；不过其中还存着不少的缺点，必须大力加以改进。
    课本对每一个时期的社会经济、政治和文化的排列、叙述，层次清楚，这是必要的。但是由于课本对许多重要问题缺乏深刻的分析，于是社会经济、政治和文化就成为失去有机联系的现象之罗列了。这里，我们举出三类的例子加以说明。
    一、课本对于基础决定上层建筑说明得不够充分。如大家所知道的，在西周初期封建社会中，土地是为周王、诸侯、卿大夫等大小贵族一再分割之下占有的，并在这种土地所有制的经济基础上，建立了大小不等的封建国家。周王和诸侯、诸侯和大夫之间，除去贡赋（课本作“贡献”）之外，无论是在经济上或在政治上，都保持其各自独立的局面，课本不但没有全面提出这些特点，而且没有以这种经济基础的特点说明政权的一再分割，没有指出作为这一时期的封建基本关系之一的贡赋，乃是各国内部冲突、及其相互之间战争的重要根源。这样就不能使人清楚地了解封建割据制和后来的封建集权制存在何种差别，以及春秋时期大国争霸的实质何在。
    二、课本对于上层建筑影响基础的反作用的说明不够。课本虽然指出了春秋时期社会生产力的发展，新兴地主阶级的出现，但在“七国混乱和秦的统一”一节中，却没有指出魏文侯的改革和商鞅变法的重要意义：这些变革为新兴地主阶级扫清前进的障碍，它是旧的封建领主和新兴地主势力消长的显著标志，它是新兴地主阶级开始以上层建筑的力量来巩固其经济基础的标志。没有这一叙述，就使人无从知道新兴地主阶级是怎样代替了旧的封建领主而走上政治舞台的。
    三、课本对于生产力和生产关系的相互关系说明不够。就旧的领主所有制来看，农夫（即农奴）以自己的工具并花费了大量的时间，去到领主的“公田”上耕作，然后才能耕作领主所指定的、为自己所使用的“私田”。这就必然产生了这个矛盾：农夫耕作“公田”的兴趣不大，耕作“私田”的兴趣就大，同时还感觉“私田”的不够使用。所以在西周晚期公田上就发生了“维莠骄骄”、草莱不除的现象。等到春秋时期生产力发展之后，这种矛盾愈形扩大，农夫对“私田”不足的要求愈形迫切。生产关系之不适合于生产力性质的情况就是如此，这种情况迫待变革。
    在这种情况下所产生的农夫和领主的矛盾，就动摇了领主的统治基础，而领主和领主之间的频繁的兼并战争，愈益加速了这种基础的崩溃。因此，在这一个历史进程中，贵族中的下层——士、一部分庶民以及商人，就取得了前此所没有的经济的和政治的地位。这些人为着巩固自己的阵地，扩大自己的阵地，就不得不对农夫让步，满足农夫的一部分要求，因此就抛弃了力役地租而采用现物地租。而在这种剥削形式（仍然是封建的实质）转变下，
    “直接生产者对于他自己的劳动时间全部的利润，已经多少可以自行支配了，虽然这个劳动时间的一部分（原来是剩余部分的全部），现在和以前一样，要无代价的，属于土地所有者”（资本论第三卷、六七九页），但多少解决了前此的基本矛盾。这样，前此的农奴就转化为农民，而这般新的土地所有者就是新兴地主。从春秋时期的开辟树林为田地，到李悝“尽地力”之教、商鞅“开阡陌”，就是因这种土地所有制的生产关系适合了生产力性质，而使社会经济发展起来。
    另外，一部分领主也因新的形势的发展，转化为新兴地主，前五九四年鲁国宣布“初税亩”就是一个例子。
    照课本的说法，领主的土地转移给新的人物，这些人物就是新兴地主了，这并不是从生产关系内容的变化来看问题的；照课本的说法，“领主和新兴的地主为了从农奴和农民身上榨取更多的收获物，防止农奴对公田怠工，就干脆不再分公田和私田，把全部土地租给农民耕种，向他们征收一定量的收获物作为地租”，领主和新兴地主是无什么分别的了，农奴农民这两个阶级的变化也就无着落了。
    由于课本对于许多基本问题认识得不够清楚，对于历史人物的分析批判也就不能够正确适当了。关于这一问题，也可以分下列两种情况来谈。
    第一种：课本对于使用暴力手段的、进行过多次战争的人物，像秦始皇、汉武帝是没有称赞一词的。课本叙述了秦始皇的一些事迹，在他的事迹之前说：“他（指秦始皇）用武力结束了五百多年的混乱局面，建立了我国历史上第一个中央集权的封建帝国”，在他的事迹之后又说：“秦始皇在结束了七国混战的局面以后，用专制横暴的手段，建立了统一的中央集权的封建帝国”，但没有进而肯定秦始皇这种统一中国的巨大作用，称他是一个有功的人物。对汉武帝的事迹也说了不少，但也没有根据汉武帝的实际情况，说他是一个英雄人物。根据这种情况，再就课本对春秋战国时期的战争——是“吞并和掠夺的战争”——的说法来看，可以说课本怕肯定这类人物就是肯定了暴力和战争的。显而易见，课本对于历史上的暴力和战争的认识也是不够透彻的。
    应当指出，马克思主义承认暴力在历史上有其一定的作用，马克思主义并不反对所有的战争，对于暴力和战争，马克思主义乃是就其一定的历史范围及其产生的后果来进行考察的。列宁说过：“我们马克思主义者与和平主义者以及无政府主义者的区别是，我们主张必须历史地（‘历史地’是从马克思辩证唯物论底观点上看）分析每个战争的特质。历史上有一些战争，虽然有它的一切恐怖性、残忍性、贫困和痛苦——这些是不可免地与每个战争联系着——，亦还是进步的，这是说有益于人类底进化……”（“社会主义与战争”）
    春秋战国时期的战争，确实是“吞并和掠夺的战争”，给人民带来很大痛苦，但是从分散的诸侯割据到统一的中央集权国家，只有通过战争的手段才能完成。恩格斯曾说，封建战争是集权国家形成过程中“一种必然的合法的阶段”。因此，对于这些战争，也就必须估计到它产生的这一后果，肯定它在这一方面的作用。
    解决了这个问题，对于秦始皇、汉武帝这类使用过暴力、进行过多次战争的人物，就要根据他们的主要贡献，给以一定的历史地位了。
    第二种：课本对于农民战争后建立统一的封建国家的统治者，像刘邦、刘秀这类人物，批判得也不够中肯。
    照课本的说法：“刘邦是流氓出身，他懂得人民希望太平的心理，更懂得地主阶级要求维持秩序的心理。”试想，一个游手好闲的流氓，他如何懂得人民希望太平的心理？又如何懂得地主阶级要求维持秩序的心理？应当说，刘邦是农民起义的领袖，他懂得人民希望太平的心理，但在农民战争取得胜利的过程中，刘邦转化为地主，所以懂得地主阶级要求维持秩序的心理。
    课本称刘秀是个大地主，组织地主武装，“乘机混进起义农民的队伍”。不错，刘秀的确是个大地主。但是他所组织的武装，是用来反抗王莽的。在反对王莽政权这个唯一的目标上，他和其他的农民军完全一致。他和他的武装加入到农民军中，对农民军是有利的。历史证明：刘秀在新汉“昆阳之战”中，曾起了重要作用，使农民战争获得决定性的胜利。既然如此，刘秀没有破坏反抗王莽政权的农民战争，显然就用不着说他“乘机混进起义农民的队伍”。
    从这两个例子可以看出来，课本因为刘邦、刘秀是皇帝，恐怕把他们说得好些会犯错误，于是就以一些庸俗的论点将他们批评一番。这完全是不必要的事。继农民战争之后建立起来的统一的封建政权，可以说是农民战争的胜利的产物。因此对于这类统一政权的建立者，无论是地主出身或是农民出身而转化为地主的一些人物，我们的批评的重点应当放置在这一方面，看他们是否对农民让步，是否对社会发展起了推进作用。不从这些论点出发，是不可能得到正确结论的。
    课本的基本问题就是如此，而有关史料运用上和解释上的错误还不在内。另外，课本还应补充一些内容，例如足以说明某一时期的经济发展和萎缩的人口数字，是要增添的；对于东汉一代具有朴素唯物主义思想的大哲学家王充，是应该给以足够的篇幅的。
    至于课本今后的改进方面，首先编者要加倍提高理论和精通业务，还要仔细地听取一些富有教学经验的教师的意见，以便由此获悉课本的篇幅大小、内容的深浅，教学实施中遇到的问题等具体情况，作为课本改进的参考。
