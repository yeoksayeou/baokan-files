    Another Shackle Placed on the Japanese People by the United States
    Signing of the "U.S.-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 4] News: With the Yoshida government in Japan urgently needing the support of the U.S. government in the Japanese general election, the "U.S.-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty," which damages Japan's economic interests, was signed in Tokyo on the 2nd.
    The "U.S.-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty" is another shackle that the United States has placed on the Japanese people in terms of economic enslavement, following unequal treaties such as the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The treaty guarantees the interests that American capital has obtained in Japan after the war, allows American investment to move freely in Japan, and places Japan's economy and trade under the tight control of American capital.
    At the beginning of the treaty's negotiation, it aroused suspicion and protest even among Japanese bourgeois figures, which caused the treaty's negotiation to be delayed for a long time. After the treaty was concluded, it immediately aroused accusations among the Japanese bourgeoisie. Japanese "economic figures" believe that the result of signing this treaty is that "the United States will economically rule Japan." The "Asahi Shimbun" on the 3rd stated that this treaty is very unsatisfactory in both its form and content. The newspaper believes that the treaty's provisions regarding American capitalists' investment and business activities in Japan "do not give full consideration to the position of the Japanese economy." Due to the particularly large disparity in economic power between the United States and Japan, "in reality, extremely unequal consequences will inevitably be brought about." Katsu Nozoe, Secretary-General of the left-wing Socialist Party, accused the Yoshida government of signing this treaty as a "farewell gift" to U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Murphy, who is about to be transferred.

    美国加在日本人民身上的又一道枷锁
    “美日通商航海条约”签字
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：在日本吉田政府极需取得美国政府在日本大选中对它加以支持的情况下，损害日本经济权益的“美日通商航海条约”已经于二日在东京签订。
    “美日通商航海条约”是继旧金山和约等不平等条约之后，美国在经济奴役方面加在日本人民身上的又一道枷锁。条约保证了美国资本战后在日本取得的利益，允许美国投资在日本自由活动，使日本的经济和贸易处于美国资本的紧紧控制之下。
    这个条约在谈判之初，甚至在日本资产阶级人士中也引起了疑惧和抗议，因此曾使条约的谈判长期拖延。在条约缔结之后，立即在日本资产阶级中激起了责难。日本“经济界人士”认为，签订这个条约的结果，“美国会在经济上统治日本”。三日的“朝日新闻”说，这个条约在它的形式和内容方面都令人非常不满意。该报认为条约关于美国资本家对日本的投资和事业活动的规定，“对于日本经济的立场，并未给予充分考虑”。由于美国和日本的经济力量特别悬殊，“实际上将不能不招致极不平等的后果”。左派社会党总书记野沟胜指责吉田政府签订这个条约是给即将调任的美国驻日大使墨菲的“离别礼物”。
