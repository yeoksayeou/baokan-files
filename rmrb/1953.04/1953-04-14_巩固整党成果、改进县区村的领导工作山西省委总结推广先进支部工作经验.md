    To consolidate and expand the achievements of rural Party rectification and to improve the leadership work in counties, districts, and villages, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee is promoting the work experience of the Party branch of Quzhai Village in Changzhi County throughout the province. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee pointed out to its subordinate party committees: Due to the lack of regular and specific leadership from higher-level party committees for the Party's rural grassroots organizations, coupled with the inability of the leading cadres of grassroots organizations to understand how to conduct the ideological and organizational work of the branch, many branches have long been in a state of varying degrees of drift. Many Party members, because they do not receive regular Party education and specific leadership, have gradually become passive and sluggish, leading to unhealthy ideological styles. This has gradually weakened the Party's grassroots organizations' connection with the broad masses of the people, and gradually lost their ability to fight against commandism, violations of law and discipline, and other bad people and deeds. This weakening of the Party's strength means the weakening of the leadership power of the national construction cause. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels must resolutely correct the current tendency of "the Party not managing the Party," and make the greatest efforts to improve the leadership level and work level of the Party's grassroots organizations, and consolidate the Party's connection with the people. This is an extremely important political task for a long time to come. To this end, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee has promoted the leadership work experience of the Quzhai Village Party Branch in Changzhi County to the entire province, and put forward the following four specific requirements: First, in April, use one week to earnestly lead and organize party work cadres at the district level and above to study the leadership work experience of the Quzhai Party Branch in Changzhi. The method of study is to first convey and read the leadership work experience of the Quzhai Party Branch, and then conduct discussions in connection with reality, carry out criticism and self-criticism, seek unified understanding, find out the key to the work of the Party branch in their respective regions, and then, on this basis, formulate specific plans, steps, and methods for promoting the leadership work experience of the Quzhai Party Branch. Second, local prefectural committees, county committees, and suburban party committees should first experiment with promoting the leadership work experience of the Quzhai branch in the rural Party branches they directly contact, earnestly summarize the experience, and promote it. Third, in order to generally improve and enhance the leadership level and work level of rural Party branches, without affecting production, short-term rotational training can be adopted at the district or key point level to train the secretaries and deputy secretaries of Party branches to learn from the leadership methods and work experience of Comrade Gou Peifang, secretary of the Quzhai Party Branch. It should be recognized that cultivating an excellent Party branch secretary is of decisive significance to the quality of branch work. Fourth, in order to overcome the bad tendency of "the Party not managing the Party," county committees and district committees must establish a system of division of labor and responsibility, and regular guidance for the work of each Party branch. Each member of the county committee and district committee must regularly contact one to three Party branches. The organizers and propagandists of the district committee should regularly contact three to five Party branches according to the actual situation in various places. The contact here means that it is necessary to regularly go deep into the Party branch to conduct inspection and assistance work. The Party committee must regularly inspect this system of contacting branches to ensure its implementation.

    巩固整党成果、改进县区村的领导工作山西省委总结推广先进支部工作经验
    中共山西省委为巩固与扩大农村整党成果，改进县、区、村的领导工作，在全省推广长治县璩寨村支部工作经验。山西省委向所属各党委指出：党的农村基层组织，由于得不到上级党委经常的具体的领导，再加上基层组织的领导干部，不懂得怎样进行支部的思想工作与组织工作，因而很多支部长期处于不同程度的自流状态中，有不少党员因为受不到党的经常教育与具体领导而逐渐消极疲塌，以至产生了不健康的思想作风。这样就使党的基层组织逐渐地削弱了同广大人民群众的联系，逐渐地丧失了向命令主义、违法乱纪等坏人坏事作斗争的能力。党的这种力量的削弱，就意味着国家建设事业的领导力量的削弱。因此各级党组织要坚决纠正目前依然存在着的党不管党的倾向，并以最大的努力去提高党的基层组织的领导水平和工作水平，巩固党与人民群众的联系，乃是今后长时期的极为重要的政治任务。为此，山西省委即向全省推广了长治县璩寨村党支部领导工作经验，并提出了以下四项具体要求。第一、在四月份内用一个星期的时间认真地领导与组织区级以上的党的工作干部，学习长治璩寨党支部的领导工作经验。学习方法，首先传达与阅读璩寨党支部的领导工作经验，然后联系实际进行讨论，开展批评与自我批评，求得统一的认识，找出自己所在地区党支部工作的关键所在，然后在此基础上拟订出推广璩寨党支部领导工作经验的具体计划、步骤和方法。第二、各地委、县委及城市郊区党委应在自己所直接联系的农村党支部中，首先试验推广璩寨支部的领导工作经验，认真地总结经验，并加以推广。第三、为了普遍地改进与提高农村党支部的领导水平与工作水平，在不影响生产的前提下，可以区或基点为单位，采取短期轮训的方式，训练党支部的书记和副书记，学习璩寨党支部书记苟佩芳同志的领导方法和工作经验。应当认识，培养一个优秀的党支部书记，对支部工作的好坏是有决定意义的。第四、为了克服党不管党的恶劣倾向，县委和区委必须建立分工负责、经常指导每个党支部工作的制度。每个县委委员和区委委员，均须经常地联系一个至三个党支部。区委的组织员和宣传员则应根据各地实际情况，经常联系三个至五个党支部。这里所指的联系，就是必须经常地深入党支部进行检查与帮助工作。这种联系支部的制度，党委必须经常检查，保证贯彻执行。
