Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 19th: According to TASS, New York, April 18th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the Burmese government's accusation of aggression against Burma by Kuomintang troops under the command of Taiwan on the 17th.

The Burmese representative, U Myint Thein, in his speech, first pointed out that the Burmese government recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. He emphasized that the Burmese government does not recognize the Chiang Kai-shek "government," and said that Burma's accusation is "directed against those small groups occupying Taiwan today..."

U Myint Thein then recounted the entry of the Kuomintang into Burma, presenting many documents to prove the responsibility of Kuomintang elements. He pointed out that the Kuomintang troops invading Burma initially numbered approximately 1,700, but have since increased to approximately 12,000.

U Myint Thein revealed that Chiang Kai-shek's claim that the Kuomintang troops in Burma were not under his control was absurd. He cited many documents, including Kuomintang documents, proving that the Kuomintang troops in Burma were under Chiang Kai-shek's jurisdiction. He further emphasized that the Kuomintang elements active in Burma were almost entirely armed with American weapons: Carbines No. 2 and No. 3, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, mortars, grenades, large-caliber machine guns, and 81 mm mortars. U Myint Thein also said that these weapons could only be supplied by external forces, and it was clear that these weapons came from Taiwan.

He then explained the Burmese government's motivation for submitting the proposal. This proposal requests the General Assembly to recommend that the Security Council condemn the "Taiwan Kuomintang government's" acts of aggression, and recommends that the Security Council take all necessary steps to immediately stop these acts of aggression.

The Indian representative, Menon, who spoke next, fully supported Burma's accusation in a brief statement.

The Czechoslovak representative, Keisler, said that he would vote in favor of the Burmese government's proposal. He called on the United Nations to take effective action to stop the Kuomintang's criminal aggression against Burma.

The Political Committee then adjourned, and the next meeting will be held on the 20th.

    联大政委会开始讨论控诉台湾残匪侵略缅甸案
    缅甸代表揭露美国用武器支助在缅匪军
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：联合国大会政治委员会十七日开始讨论缅甸政府控诉台湾指挥下的国民党军队侵略缅甸案。
    缅甸代表吴敏登在发言中首先指出：缅甸政府承认中华人民共和国政府是中国唯一的合法政府。他强调缅甸政府不承认蒋介石“政府”，并说，缅甸的控诉是“针对着那些今天占据着台湾的一小撮人……”。
    吴敏登然后追述国民党侵入缅甸的经过，提出许多文件来证明国民党分子的责任。他指出，侵入缅甸的国民党军队起初大约有一千七百人，后已增加至一万二千人左右。
    吴敏登揭露了蒋介石所谓缅甸境内的国民党军队不在他控制之下的说法是荒唐的。他引证了许多文件，其中包括国民党文件，证明缅甸境内的国民党军队是在蒋介石管辖之下。他进一步强调指出，在缅甸活动的国民党分子几乎完全是用美国武器武装起来的：二号和三号卡宾枪、轻机关枪、重机关枪、迫击炮、手榴弹、大口径的机关枪与八十一公厘的迫击炮。吴敏登又说，这些武器只有外界的力量才能供给，而显然的，这些武器是来自台湾。
    他然后说明缅甸政府提出提案的动机。这个提案要求大会建议安全理事会谴责“台湾国民党政府”的侵略行为，并建议安全理事会采取一切必要步骤使这些侵略行为立即停止。
    接着发言的印度代表梅农在一篇简短的声明中，全力支持缅甸的控诉。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表凯斯尔说，他将投票赞成缅甸政府的提案。他要求联合国采取有效行动，来制止国民党对缅甸进行的罪恶侵略。
    政治委员会至此休会，下次会议将在二十日举行。
