Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 11th: Pravda published an editorial on April 11th commenting on achieving a Korean armistice and ending the Korean War.

	Pravda, in reviewing the history, said the history of the Korean negotiations began as early as July 1950 with the Soviet government leader J.V. Stalin's response to Indian Prime Minister Nehru's appeal; achieving an armistice is in the interest of the people of all countries who have children fighting on both sides of the front, and also in the fundamental interest of all countries.

	But the facts show that it would be wrong to close our eyes and not see the environment. This environment is that even today, there are not only open enemies but also hidden enemies to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. They are indignant about the prospect of peace in Korea and are doing everything possible to complicate the Korean issue in order to prolong the Korean War.

	For example, Washington correspondents of American newspapers are tirelessly spreading rumors that General Clark has been instructed to involve the Korean issue with other completely unrelated issues (such as the Indochina issue). This kind of attempt is now beginning. The absurdity of this plan is obvious.

	Pravda continued: Some newspapers even said that when negotiating a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the United States would try to push the border of South Korea north of the current front line.

	But the Washington Post, which is close to American officials, rightly ridiculed this meaningless and useless attempt. The newspaper pointed out that it might insist on a new ceasefire line for bargaining purposes, but if so, people could easily accuse the United States of being unwilling to reach a solution.

	Needless to say, all such attempts are doomed to complete failure. Neither the open nor the hidden enemies of peace, neither the open nor the hidden enemies of ending the Korean War, can further their goals, no matter how hard they try to hinder the reopened Panmunjom negotiations.

	Pravda concluded: Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai's positive response to General Clark regarding the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war made it possible to resume negotiations in Panmunjom. Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to resolve the entire issue of repatriation of prisoners of war has laid a solid foundation for achieving an armistice and ending the Korean War. The progress of the Panmunjom negotiations shows that initial results have been achieved in the fair resolution of the Korean issue.

    苏联真理报发表社论评论获致朝鲜停战和结束朝鲜战争问题
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：真理报四月十一日发表社论评论获致朝鲜停战和结束朝鲜战争问题。
    朝鲜谈判的历史是早在一九五○年七月由苏联政府元首约·维·斯大林对印度总理尼赫鲁的呼吁的答复开始的；真理报回顾这段历史说：获致停战符合于有儿女在战线的两边作战的各国人民的利益，也符合所有各国人民的根本利益。
    但是事实表明，如果闭起眼睛，不看到环境，那就错误了。这环境就是：甚至到今天，对于朝鲜问题的和平解决，也还不仅有公开的敌人，而且也有暗藏的敌人。他们对于朝鲜和平的远景愤愤不满，尽一切努力把朝鲜问题复杂化，藉以把朝鲜战争拖下去。
    举例说，美国报纸的华盛顿记者们就在孜孜不倦地散播谣言，说是克拉克将军已经受命把朝鲜问题与其他根本无关的问题（例如印度支那问题）牵涉在一起。这一类的试图现在正在开始。这种打算的荒谬是显然的。
    真理报继续说：某些报纸甚至竟说，在谈判朝鲜问题的和平解决的时候，美国将试图把南朝鲜的边境推到目前战线以北。
    但是接近美国官方的华盛顿邮报很正确地嘲笑了这种无意义和没有用的企图。该报指出，也许会坚持新的停战线以便讨价还价，但是如果这样，人们就可以很容易地斥责美国不愿意获致解决。
    用不着说，所有这一类的企图都是要完全失败的。不管是和平的公开的或暗藏的敌人，不管是结束朝鲜战争的公开的或暗藏的敌人，都不能把他们的目的促进一步，不管他们用多大力气来阻挠重开了的板门店谈判。
    真理报最后说：金日成和彭德怀给克拉克将军关于交换病伤战俘的积极的答复，使得恢复板门店的谈判有了可能。周恩来总理提出的解决整个遣返战俘问题的方案，已经使得获致停战和结束朝鲜战争有了坚实的基础。板门店谈判的进展表明，公正解决朝鲜问题方面的最初的成果已经取得。
