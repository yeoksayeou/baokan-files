    Ningxia builds Yellow River Bank Protection Forest Belt
    Ningxia Province has begun to construct a Yellow River bank protection forest belt. This forest belt stretches from Zhongwei County in Ningxia Province to Dengkou County, a total length of one thousand li. The construction of this forest belt will preserve the soil and water along the Yellow River, greatly reduce the sediment content of the Yellow River, and create favorable conditions for the fundamental control of the Yellow River.
    The Yellow River banks within Ningxia Province are mostly sandy beaches, without fixed embankments, and have suffered severely from wind and sand erosion and river scouring over the years, resulting in a large loss of soil and water. In order to protect farmland and the Yellow River banks, and to gradually clarify the Yellow River water, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government mobilized farmers of all ethnic groups last year to build 3,850 mu of bank protection forests in Zhongning, Dengkou and other places. This year, it was decided to build another 10,218 mu of bank protection forests in the counties along the Yellow River in Jinji, Lingwu, Ningshuo, and Yongning. The plan is to gradually connect points into lines, and finally create a Yellow River bank protection forest belt.

    宁夏造黄河护岸林带
    宁夏省已开始营造黄河护岸林带。这条林带自宁夏省中卫县起到磴口县止，共长一千华里。这条林带的营造，将使黄河沿岸水土得以保持，使黄河河水的含沙量大大减少，为根治黄河创造良好条件。
    宁夏境内黄河沿岸多为泥沙滩地，无固定河堤，历年来受风沙侵袭和河水冲蚀很厉害，水土大量流失。为了保护农田和黄河堤岸，使黄河河水逐年澄清，宁夏省人民政府去年便动员各族农民在中宁、磴口等地营造了三千八百五十亩护岸林。今年又决定在金积、灵武、宁朔、永宁黄河沿岸各县营造一万零二百一十八亩护岸林。计划逐步从点连接成线，最后造成一条黄河护岸林带。
