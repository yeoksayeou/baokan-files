Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch: West German Bonn "government" Premier Adenauer and Eisenhower and Dulles yesterday concluded three days of talks, completing a negotiation of conspiracy to sell out the interests of the German nation and undermine peace.

A lengthy communique issued after the talks and information from outside the talks indicate that the discussions focused on accelerating the rearmament of West Germany through the so-called "European Defense Community" as a preparation for a new war.

The communique emphasized: "During the talks, it was unanimously believed that all parties concerned should unswervingly promote and ensure the early ratification of the treaty establishing the European Defense Community in order to achieve European unification." Adenauer expressed "willingness to cooperate" in this regard. According to sources outside the talks, this cooperation includes the rapid ratification of the Paris and Bonn war treaties by the West German Federal Senate, with West Germany using substantial funds to build up armaments and provide cannon fodder.

On the American side, Eisenhower pledged to "help equip German troops" once the war treaties are ratified and also promised to "re-examine" the status of Nazi war criminals currently in custody, and agreed to "return" more than 300 former Nazi naval vessels that were seized by the United States at the end of the war for reparations. Eisenhower also promised to increase the amount of armaments ordered by the United States from West Germany in the future, conditional upon the implementation of the Paris and Bonn treaties.

The communique also mentioned that Adenauer had agreed to negotiate and conclude a "treaty of commerce and navigation" with the United States as soon as possible, similar to the past "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" and the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" recently signed by the Yoshida government, which betrayed Japan.

The thorny Saar issue was raised during the talks, and the communique only stated that this issue "should be resolved as soon as possible."

The American bourgeois propaganda machine touted the "friendly" atmosphere of the talks and meaningfully called Adenauer "almost the only true American candidate" in the upcoming West German elections.

    美国与西德的会谈已经结束
    艾森豪威尔答应尽速重新武装西德
    据新华社讯：华盛顿消息：西德波恩“政府”总理阿登纳和艾森豪威尔及杜勒斯昨日结束了历时三天的会谈，完成了一场阴谋出卖德国民族利益和破坏和平的谈判。
    会谈后发表的一个长篇公报和会外的消息说明，会谈主要集中在加紧通过所谓“欧洲防务集团”来重新武装西德作为新战争准备的问题。
    公报着重地说：“会谈中一致深信，一切有关方面应毫不动摇地推进，务使早日批准建立欧洲防务集团的条约，以达到欧洲的统一。”阿登纳表示在这方面“愿意合作”。据会外消息，这种合作包括由西德联邦参议院从速批准巴黎和波恩战争条约，西德以大量经费用于建立军备以及提供炮灰。
    在美国方面，艾森豪威尔保证当战争条约一得到批准就“帮助装备德国部队”，还答应“重新研究”现在仍在拘押中的纳粹战犯的地位问题，并答应将把大战结束时由美国负责扣留供赔偿之用的前纳粹海军船只三百余艘“归还”。艾森豪威尔并同样以实施巴黎及波恩条约为条件答应将来增加美国向西德定购的军火数量。
    公报还提到阿登纳已答应尽速与美国谈判订立类似过去“中美商约”和日本吉田卖国政府新近签订的“美日通商航海条约”的“商务和航运的条约”。
    会谈中提出了使美国棘手的萨尔问题，公报只说这个问题“应求得早日的解决”。
    美国资产阶级宣传机器吹嘘会谈的“友好”空气，并意味深长地把阿登纳称为西德即将举行的选举中
    “差不多唯一真正的美国候选人”。
