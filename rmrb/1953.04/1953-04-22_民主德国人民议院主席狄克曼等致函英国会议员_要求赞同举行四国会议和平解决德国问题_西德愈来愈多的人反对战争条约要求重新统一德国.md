Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 21st: According to the German News Agency on April 20th, Chairman Dieckmann, Vice-Chairmen Materne, Goldenbaum, Homann, and Gotting of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic delivered a jointly signed letter to Major General Coleman, the British Commander in Berlin, on April 11th. They requested him to forward the letter to the Speaker of the British House of Commons. In the letter, they represented the People's Chamber in asking that the letter be sent to British parliamentarians, urging them to join the German people in demanding a Four-Power conference to peacefully resolve the German question.

The letter pointed out: The forces that brought such immense misfortune to the peoples of all nations twice in this century are now gaining increasing influence in West Germany. The arms magnate Krupp has already regained his position. Schacht, the organizer of Hitler's arms policy, is traveling in Africa and Asia for the benefit of West German capital groups, in order to restart a new commercial and political conspiracy against other countries. The Bonn government is reorganizing Hitler's old army. Hitler's generals are being reappointed to command an aggressive military institution.

As a result, peace and the security of all people are threatened.

After mentioning the painful lessons of the revival of German militarism after the First World War, the letter emphasized: The best guarantee of lasting peace in Europe is a Germany that is truly free from imperialism and militarism, and that devotes its strength entirely to peaceful construction; a Germany that obtains raw materials through peaceful economic relations with all countries, rather than through dumping and wage reductions to compete, or even through new colonial policies.

The best way to peacefully resolve the German question in accordance with the interests of all nations is to convene a conference of the four powers of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France as soon as possible. Holding a Four-Power conference will be an effective contribution to the reconstruction of German unity and the democratization of German organization, and will effectively help the German people.

The letter concluded: The German and British people are already linked together by the common and significant interests of defending peace. The Bonn and Paris war treaties are in direct violation of these interests. Therefore, we express the hope that the members of the British House of Commons will unite with us, in order to take the path of peaceful understanding between nations, and demand the speedy convening of a Four-Power conference to achieve this goal.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 21st: News from Berlin: More and more people from all walks of life in West Germany are joining the struggle against the Bonn and Paris war treaties and demanding the reunification of Germany.

In Hamburg, six thousand workers from the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and non-party individuals gathered on April 16th to hold a meeting commemorating the 67th anniversary of the birth of Ernst Thälmann, the outstanding leader of the German working class. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Bonn and Paris war treaties and called on the people of West Germany to fight for the unification of Germany.

In Mannheim, representatives of many organizations representing eight million returnees held a meeting to express their opposition to the implementation of the Bonn and Paris war treaties. The resolution passed at the meeting stated: These treaties will deepen the division of Germany, increase the danger of new wars, and make it virtually impossible to solve social welfare problems due to the burden of huge war expenses. The representatives called on all returnees to help reach an understanding between Germans, so that an all-German delegation could participate in the Four-Power conference.

People in Hamburg, Oberramstadt, Mannheim, Schönau, and many other cities have held numerous demonstrations and rallies, endorsing the program of the "All-German Congress" movement, demanding immediate talks between East and West Germany, the convening of a Four-Power conference to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and the holding of elections to establish an independent, democratic, and peace-loving all-German government.

    民主德国人民议院主席狄克曼等致函英国会议员
    要求赞同举行四国会议和平解决德国问题
    西德愈来愈多的人反对战争条约要求重新统一德国
    【新华社二十一日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林二十日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼、副主席马特恩、戈登堡姆、霍曼、戈丁在四月十一日将一封联合署名的信递交给了柏林英军司令科尔曼少将，要他将这封信转交给英国下院议长，他们在信中代表人民议院要求把信发给英国国会议员，要他们与德国人民共同要求举行四大国会议以和平解决德国问题。
    信中指出：在本世纪中两次带给各民族人民以这样巨大的不幸的力量现在在西德又愈来愈得势了。军火大王克虏伯已经又恢复了他的地位，希特勒军备政策的组织者沙赫特为了西德资本集团的利益，正在非洲和亚洲旅行，以便再开始一个反对其他国家的、商业的和政治的新阴谋。波恩政府正在重新组织希特勒的旧军队。希特勒将领们正在重新被任命指挥一个侵略性的军事机构。
    结果，和平和一切人民的安全已受到威胁。
    信中提到第一次大战后复活德国军国主义的惨痛教训后强调说：欧洲持久和平的最好的保证就是一个真正摆脱了帝国主义与军国主义、把它的力量完全用于和平建设的德国，一个通过与所有国家保持和平的经济关系，而不是靠以倾销和减低工资进行竞争甚至靠新的殖民政策来取得原料的德国。
    合乎各国人民利益的和平解决德国问题的最好方法就是尽可能快地召集一次英、苏、美、法四国的会议。举行四大国会议对于重建德国的统一、使德国的组织民主化将是一个有效的贡献，并将有效地帮助德国人民。
    信件最后说：德国与英国人民已经因为保卫和平的共同的重大利益而联系在一起。波恩与巴黎战争条约是直接违反这种利益的。因此我们表示希望英国下院的议员们与我们团结起来，为了采取各国人民间和平谅解的道路，要求迅速举行四大国会议以达到这个目标。
    【新华社二十一日讯】柏林消息：愈来愈多的西德各阶层人民正在参加到反对波恩和巴黎战争条约、要求重新统一德国的斗争中来。
    在汉堡，六千名共产党、社会民主党和无党派的工人四月十六日在一起举行了一次纪念德国工人阶级卓越的领袖恩斯特·台尔曼诞生六十七周年的集会，会上一致通过决议，反对波恩与巴黎战争条约，并号召西德人民为争取德国的统一而斗争。
    在曼海姆，代表着八百万归国侨民的许多组织的代表举行集会，表示反对实行波恩和巴黎战争条约。会上通过的决议说：这些条约将使德国的分裂加深。增加新战争的危险，并且由于负担庞大的战争费用而使解决社会福利问题在实际上成为不可能。代表们号召一切归国侨民帮助使德国人之间达成谅解，从而使一个全德国的代表团有可能参加四大国会议。
    汉堡、奥伯拉姆斯塔特、曼海姆、绍瑙和其他许多城市的人民举行了许多次的示威和集会，赞同“全德大会”运动的纲领，要求立即举行东西德会谈、召开四国会议以缔结对德和约和举行选举，成立一个独立的、民主的、爱好和平的全德政府。
