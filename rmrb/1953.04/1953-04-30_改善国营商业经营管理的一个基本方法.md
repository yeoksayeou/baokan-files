For several months, the state-owned commercial system has begun to implement the economic accounting system in many grassroots enterprises. Units that have implemented it well have shown many new features, changing the past practice of relying solely on asking superiors for money and goods without actively turning them over or considering profits and losses. They have begun to pay attention to the investigation and research of production and sales situations and market needs; they have improved organization and systems, cleared up property, and actively tried to expand and accelerate circulation and reduce costs. Some units have completed their purchase and sales plans, some are close to completion, and some have begun to turn from losing money to breaking even or making a slight profit. This shows that the correct implementation of the economic accounting system is a fundamental method for improving the operation and management of state-owned commerce. We can believe that conscientiously and correctly implementing the economic accounting system will improve the quality of state-owned commercial work and better serve industrial and agricultural production and consumers.

However, at the same time, a few units have experienced some shortcomings in the process of implementing the economic accounting system. The main problem is setting the implementation of the economic accounting system against the implementation of policies and the completion of plans. This is reflected in either being hesitant in management, or understanding socialist economic accounting as only calculating profits like private merchants, while ignoring the purchase of goods, replenishing necessary inventory, and ensuring market supply. These units have shown an extremely irresponsible attitude towards production and people's needs. As a result, some commodities have been out of stock, production has been affected, and circulation and financial plans have not been completed. The basic reasons for the above shortcomings are, on the one hand, the failure to completely overcome the supply system management thinking, the serious existence of bureaucracy, and, more importantly, the failure to establish a comprehensive economic accounting ideology.

The commodity circulation plan of state-owned commerce should fully reflect the policy requirements of the Party and the state. The Party and the state require state-owned commerce to regularly understand the needs of the country and the people, and through procurement and sales, stabilize prices reasonably, consolidate and develop cooperatives; expand material exchanges under the leadership of the state-owned economy, promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, and gradually enhance planning to protect the interests of producers and consumers. Each enterprise unit of state-owned commerce should formulate a correct commodity circulation plan in accordance with the requirements of the Party and the state and in combination with the specific conditions of the region, and actively strive to complete and over fulfill it. Therefore, the idea and practice that implementing economic accounting means not following policy requirements to formulate and complete commodity circulation plans is wrong. At present, some incorrect phenomena have occurred in the work of formulating and completing commodity circulation plans in some units, such as unilaterally compressing inventory without actively purchasing goods; only selling good, branded goods that can make more money, without paying attention to operating local goods needed by the people; not operating commodities with lower profits; in order to accelerate capital turnover, disregarding the necessary reasonable inventory, wholesale stations not making necessary seasonal reasonable reserves, and not actively expanding commodity circulation, etc. The result of this practice will inevitably hinder production development and market supply, weaken the leading position of state-owned commerce in the market, which is of course not in line with policy requirements, and will inevitably reduce sales and fail to expand commodity circulation, which is also not in line with the requirements of the economic accounting system.

The financial plan of state-owned commerce is based on a correct commodity circulation plan and a correct price policy. This can accelerate capital turnover, reduce costs, ensure reasonable profits, and accumulate funds for national economic construction. The requirement of our price policy is to guide production, take care of the interests of consumers and transporters, and give play to the leading role of the state-owned economy in the market. The profit policy of state-owned commerce must conform to this requirement to be correct and feasible. Under a correct and feasible price policy, the profits of state-owned commerce can only be obtained by accelerating turnover and reducing costs. At present, the prices of some commodities are not very reasonable in some areas. This can easily affect the correct formulation of financial plans and the correct implementation of commodity circulation plans. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate and study, make careful calculations, and gradually adjust prices through certain procedures. However, the calculation of prices must be under the principle of conforming to policy requirements, implementing the idea of accelerating turnover, reducing costs, and completing the delivery of profits. Relying on the method of setting prices too high to complete the delivery of profits, rather than relying on the methods of accelerating turnover and reducing costs, is not only a violation of policy, but also because the price is too high, it will reduce sales, and the result will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of the commodity circulation plan and financial plan. Of course, setting the price too low will affect production and the market, which is also not in line with policy and does not meet the requirements of the economic accounting system. Of course, the implementation of the economic accounting system by grassroots enterprises of state-owned commerce is just beginning, and we cannot make an accurate financial plan all at once, which requires relying on all employees to improve their policy level and make careful calculations so that the financial plan gradually improves its accuracy.

It should be affirmed that the implementation of the economic accounting system can improve the operation and management of state-owned commerce and better formulate and complete commodity circulation plans and financial plans. Because the economic accounting system is the basic method of operation and management of socialist enterprises. The implementation of the economic accounting system, the verification of funds, the independent calculation of profits and losses, and the implementation of reward measures are conducive to each enterprise unit giving full play to its independent management initiative and creativity under the unified plan of the state. The requirements for the implementation of the economic accounting system in the state-owned commercial system are to expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce costs. In order to achieve these, it is necessary to rely on all employees, make careful calculations, implement scientific management, have regular understanding of production and people's needs and the operating costs of various economies, and know our own property clearly, so as to formulate correct commodity circulation plans and financial plans. It is not possible to meet the requirements of economic accounting without improving the accuracy of the plan. Only by constantly improving the connection of various internal links, clarifying responsibilities, gradually reducing the commodity circulation links, tightening the connection between each other, making transportation more reasonable, improving warehouse work, and implementing personnel quotas can we meet the requirements of economic accounting and ensure better completion of commodity circulation plans and financial plans.

For the state-owned commercial system, the implementation of the economic accounting system is a major reform in ideology, organization, and system. It is necessary to overcome the supply system management thinking of not calculating profits and losses and not being responsible among all employees, especially to establish a comprehensive economic accounting ideology, so that this advanced working method can be correctly implemented. The idea that economic accounting can be implemented as long as funds are verified from top to bottom and wholesale stations are established without improving the thinking of the masses of employees is wrong. The economic accounting system can only be done well by relying on the awareness and enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees. At present, we should strengthen political work in state-owned commerce, continuously publicize the comprehensive economic accounting ideology, so that all employees fully understand the purpose, requirements, methods, and significance of implementing the economic accounting system in economic construction; combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, carry out self-criticism from bottom to top combined with inspections from top to bottom to improve the class consciousness of the broad masses of employees and improve work. Experience has shown that the higher the class consciousness of state-owned commercial employees, the more profoundly they understand the status and role of state-owned commerce, the higher their enthusiasm; the more specifically and profoundly they understand their status and role in state-owned commercial work, the easier it is for their creativity to be brought into play. Party committees at all levels and leading organs of state-owned commerce at all levels should strengthen the ideological leadership of state-owned commercial employees, establish a comprehensive economic accounting ideology, correctly implement the economic accounting system, strive to complete commodity circulation plans and financial plans, and better serve the needs of production and the people.

### 改善国营商业经营管理的一个基本方法

    改善国营商业经营管理的一个基本方法
    国营商业系统几个月来在很多基层企业中开始实行了经济核算制。实行得较好的单位，已出现了许多新的气象，改变了过去那种单靠向上级要钱要货而不积极周转、不计盈亏的做法；开始注意了产销情况和市场需要的调查研究；改进了组织和制度，清理了财产，积极设法扩大和加速流转，降低费用。有些单位已完成了购销计划，有些接近完成，有些已开始从赔钱转到保本或稍有盈利。这可以看出：正确实行经济核算制是改善国营商业经营管理的一个基本方法。我们可以相信，认真地正确地贯彻经济核算制，就会使国营商业工作质量提高，更好地为工农业生产服务，为消费者服务。
    但同时也有少数单位，在贯彻经济核算制过程中，发生了若干缺点。这主要是：把实行经济核算制和贯彻政策、完成计划对立起来。这表现在经营上不是缩手缩脚，就是把社会主义经济核算了解成像私商一样只计算赚钱，而忽视了进货、充实必需的库存和保证市场供应。这些单位对生产和人民需要表现出极不负责的态度。结果造成若干商品脱销，生产遭到影响，流转计划和财务计划都未完成。造成以上缺点的基本原因，一方面是供给制经营思想未能彻底克服，官僚主义作风仍严重存在，更重要的是全面的经济核算思想没有树立起来。
    国营商业的商品流转计划，应该是充分体现党和国家的政策要求的。党和国家要求国营商业经常了解国家和人民的需要，通过收购和推销，使物价稳定、合理，使合作社巩固、发展；使各种经济成份在国营经济领导下，扩大物资交流，促进工农业生产的发展，逐步增强计划性，来保护生产者和消费者的利益。国营商业的每个企业单位都应该根据党和国家的要求，结合地区的具体情况，制定出正确的商品流转计划，并积极争取完成和超额完成。因此，以为实行经济核算，就可以不按政策要求来制定和完成商品流转计划的想法和做法是错误的。目前若干单位在制订和完成商品流转计划工作中发生了一些不正确的现象，如片面压缩库存而不积极进货；只卖好的，只卖能多赚钱的名牌货，而不注意经营人民需要的本地货；对于利润较低的商品便不经营；为了加速资金周转，便不顾应有的合理库存，批发站不作必要的季节性的合理储备，不积极扩大商品流通等等。这种做法的结果，必然妨害生产发展和市场供应，削弱国营商业对市场上的领导地位，这当然是不符合政策要求的，同时也必然会缩小卖钱额，不能扩大商品流通，也就和经济核算制的要求不相符合。
    国营商业的财务计划，是建立在正确的商品流转计划和正确的价格政策的基础上的。这才能加速资金周转，降低费用，保证合理利润，为国家经济建设积累资金。我们价格政策的要求，是要指导生产、照顾消费者和贩运者的利益，发挥国营经济对市场的领导作用。国营商业的利润政策必须服从这一要求才是正确的，可行的。在正确、可行的价格政策之下，国营商业利润只有靠加速周转、降低费用的办法才能取得。目前若干商品的价格，在若干地区尚不十分合理。这就容易影响财务计划的正确制订和商品流转计划的正确执行。因此，就必须调查研究、精打细算，经过一定的手续，逐步调整价格。但在计算价格时必须是在服从政策要求的原则之下，贯彻加速周转、降低费用、完成上缴利润的思想。不依靠加速周转、降低费用的方法，而依靠定价过高的方法来完成上缴利润，不只是违反政策，而且由于价格过高，会缩小卖钱额，结果必然会使商品流转计划和财务计划破产。当然价格定的过低，会影响生产和市场，也是不符合政策，同时也不符合经济核算制的要求的。当然国营商业基层企业实行经济核算制正在开始，我们还不能一下子作出准确的财务计划，这就需要依靠全体职工，提高政策水平，精打细算，使财务计划逐步提高它的准确程度。
    应该肯定实行经济核算制，是能够改善国营商业的经营管理，更好地制定和完成商品流转计划和财务计划的。因为经济核算制是社会主义企业经营管理的基本方法。实行经济核算制，核定资金，独立计算盈亏，实行奖励办法，这就有利于每一个企业单位在国家统一计划之下，充分发挥其独立经营的积极性和创造性。国营商业系统实行经济核算制的要求，就是扩大商品流通、加速资金周转、降低费用。为着做到这些，就必须依靠全体职工，精打细算，实行科学管理，对生产和人民需要及各种经济的经营成本要有经常的了解，对自己的财产要知道清楚，这才能制定出正确的商品流转计划和财务计划。不提高计划的准确性是不能够达到经济核算的要求的。只有不断地改善内部各个环节的联系，明确责任，使商品流转环节逐渐减少，相互间联系紧密，运输更趋合理，仓库工作改善，实行人员定额，这样才能符合经济核算的要求，才能保证更好地完成商品流转计划和财务计划。
    对于国营商业系统说来，实行经济核算制是一个思想上、组织上、制度上的重大改革。必须在全体职工中，克服不计盈亏、不负责任的供给制经营思想，特别是要树立全面的经济核算思想，才能使这个先进的工作方法能够正确地贯彻。以为只要自上而下核定资金、建立批发站，而不提高职工群众的思想便可以实行经济核算制的想法是错误的。经济核算制是依靠广大职工的觉悟和积极性的提高才能做好的。当前应该加强国营商业中的政治工作，不断地宣传全面的经济核算思想，使全体职工全面地了解经济核算制的目的、要求、方法以及实行经济核算制在经济建设中的意义；结合反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，开展与自上而下的检查相结合的自下而上的批评，以提高广大职工的阶级觉悟，改善工作。经验证明：国营商业职工们的阶级觉悟越提高，他们对于国营商业的地位和作用也越了解得深刻，他们的积极性便越高；他们对自己在国营商业工作中的地位和作用越了解得具体深刻，他们的创造性便越容易发挥。各级党委，各级国营商业领导机关，应该加强对国营商业职工的思想领导，树立全面的经济核算思想，正确地贯彻经济核算制，努力完成商品流转计划和财务计划，更好地为生产和人民的需要服务。
