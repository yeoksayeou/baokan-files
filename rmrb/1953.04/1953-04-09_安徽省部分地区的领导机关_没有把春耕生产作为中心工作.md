Leadership organs in parts of Anhui Province have not earnestly implemented the spirit of "taking spring plowing and production as the overriding central task in the countryside," resulting in a chaotic pace of rural work and severely affecting spring plowing and production.

In the eastern suburban district of Hefei City, the "single-minded" promotion of the Marriage Law is severely divorced from current production work. Chen Aimei, a cadre in the work team, said: "The municipal party committee sent us here to work on the Marriage Law; we don't care about spring plowing and production." When Zhangwa Township held a cadre meeting to promote and implement the Marriage Law, Yin Dianhai, a construction clerk, asked to talk about spring repair work at the meeting, but was refused. Because everyone was fully implementing the Marriage Law and abandoning production work, even the agricultural loan that the People's Bank was going to issue in the township could not be distributed. In Dongwai Township, more than 160 grassroots cadres were gathered for large lectures every day from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM to study the Marriage Law. Santang Township required farmers to complete the entire text of the "Marriage Law," the "Outline for Propaganda of the Marriage Law," and "Reference Materials" for implementing the Marriage Law within three days, which exhausted the masses. Leading cadres in the district have not studied production since the Spring Festival. As of now, the district committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the district people's government have not yet formulated a plan to carry out spring plowing and production. They are completely unaware of the serious shortage of fertilizer, cattle, farm tools, and food among farmers in spring plowing and production.

Mengcheng, Yingshang, Fengtai, and Guoyang counties in the Fuyang Special District have all listed the implementation of the Marriage Law and "withdrawing from the Tao" (withdrawing from reactionary Taoist sects) as central tasks. Therefore, some district and township cadres mistakenly believe that "withdrawing from the Tao is first, production is second." This approach is severely divorced from the masses. The masses in Liulin District generally expressed dissatisfaction, saying: The People's Government is good, but it has put the "head" of work in the wrong place. At a meeting of township cadres in Banqiao District, four members of the district committee of the Chinese Communist Party (a district party secretary, a district head, a deputy district head, and a district committee member) each arranged a set of tasks, each emphasizing the importance of "their own" work and the need to complete the task. After the meeting, the township cadres all stared blankly and said: So many tasks have been arranged, which one is the head?

### 安徽省部分地区的领导机关  没有把春耕生产作为中心工作

    安徽省部分地区的领导机关
    没有把春耕生产作为中心工作
    安徽省部分地区的领导机关，没有认真贯彻“春耕生产为当前农村中压倒一切的中心任务”的精神，农村工作步调紊乱，严重地影响了春耕生产。
    合肥市东郊区“单打一”地宣传婚姻法，严重地脱离了当前的生产工作。工作组的干部陈爱美说：“市委是叫我们来搞婚姻法的，春耕生产我们不管。”张洼乡开干部大会宣传贯彻婚姻法时，建设科员尹殿海要求在会上谈谈春修工作，但被拒绝了。由于大家全力贯彻婚姻法，放下生产工作，以致人民银行要在该乡发放的耕牛贷款都无法发放下去。东外乡每天下午二时到五时集合一百六十多个基层干部上大课，学习婚姻法。三塘乡要农民在三天内学完“婚姻法”全文、“婚姻法宣传提纲”以及贯彻婚姻法的“参考资料”，使得群众疲惫不堪。该区领导干部自春节以来，没有研究过生产。直到目前，中共区委会和区人民政府还没有订出开展春耕生产的计划。他们对农民在春耕生产中存在的缺肥料、缺牛、缺农具和口粮的严重情况，一无所知。
    阜阳专区蒙城、颍上、凤台、涡阳等县都把贯彻婚姻法和“退道”（退出反动道门）工作列为中心。因此，有些区乡干部便错误地认为“退道第一，生产第二”。这样的做法，严重地脱离群众。柳林区群众普遍表示不满，说：人民政府好是好，就是把工作的“头”摆错了。板桥区召开乡干部会议，中共区委会四个委员（一个区委书记、一个区长、一个副区长、一个区委委员）在会上各布置一套，各人都强调“自己的”工作重要，都必须完成任务。会后，乡干部都瞪着眼说：布置了这么些工作，那一个是头呢？
