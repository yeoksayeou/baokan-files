Party Propaganda Departments Must Strengthen Leadership Over Rural Primary School Education

The error of the Gengjiazhuang Primary School teacher in Wuqiang County, Hebei Province, who fantasized about running a so-called "collectivized school," is a principled error that violates the New Democratic education policy. This practice not only damaged the correct relationship between the school and the students' families, leading children down a wrong path, but also blurred the peasants' understanding of the future development of society.

In essence, the idea of this so-called "collectivized school" is a replica of the "eating from the same pot" mentality. Although this matter is isolated, it exposes several issues that deserve serious attention.

First, this shows that the political study situation of some primary school teachers is still very poor. They not only do not understand what kind of process is required to transition from a New Democratic society to a socialist society, but they are also unclear about the current education policies. Secondly, this also shows that among some district and township cadres, even cadres at the section chief level in Wuqiang County, some people still do not understand the direction of rural economic development, the policies of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the principles of school education. The head of the Culture and Education Section of Wuqiang County is a cadre who is directly responsible for the school education work in the county. Since he does not understand many policies, he should be cautious in everything, study diligently, and report to his superiors when encountering important issues. However, instead of doing this, he pretended to know when he did not, and blindly nodded "yes" to wrong ideas and practices. This is very wrong. All of these powerfully illustrate that the leadership of some Party propaganda departments over school education is still very weak. For example, the Propaganda Department of the Wuqiang County Party Committee remains deaf to the extremely bad impact that the so-called "collectivized school" incident has already caused among the masses. From this, it can be seen that some Party propaganda departments have long neglected educational work, relaxed, or even abandoned their leadership over school education work, which has caused very serious consequences.

We must learn from this incident. Party propaganda departments at all levels must strengthen the political leadership of primary school teachers and cultural and educational cadres, and in particular, strengthen their education on cultural and educational policies. The facts have eloquently shown that if the Party relaxes its leadership over a certain task, then problems are bound to occur in that task. Therefore, strengthening the Party's leadership over rural primary school education is the fundamental key to rectifying primary school education and running rural primary schools well.

### 党委宣传部门必须加强对农村小学教育工作的领导

    党委宣传部门必须加强对农村小学教育工作的领导
    河北武强县耿家庄小学教师幻想办所谓“集体化学校”的错误，是违背新民主主义教育方针的一个带有原则性质的错误。这种做法，不但破坏了学校和学生家庭的正确关系，把儿童引上邪路；同时，也模糊了农民对社会发展前途的认识。
    这种所谓“集体化学校”的思想，在实质上，正是“吃大锅饭”思想的翻版。这件事情虽然是个别的，但它暴露了若干值得严重注意的问题。
    首先，这说明了某些小学教师的政治学习情况还很糟糕。他们不仅不了解从新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会要经过怎样的一个过程，就是对于当前的教育方针、政策，也是不清楚的。其次，这也说明了在某些区乡干部当中，甚至像武强县的科长一级的干部当中，也有些人对农村经济的发展方向、对互助合作运动政策、对学校教育方针等等，也还是不了解的。武强县文教科长是对本县学校教育工作负有直接领导责任的干部，他既然对很多政策都不了解，就应当凡事谨慎，认真学习，遇到重要问题便向上级请示报告；但他不但不这样，反而强不知以为知，对错误的想法和做法盲目地点头说“行”。这是很不应该的。所有这些，都有力地说明了某些党委宣传部门对学校教育工作的领导，还十分薄弱。如中共武强县委宣传部，对于所谓“集体化学校”的事件已经在群众当中造成的极坏的影响，仍然充耳不闻。由此可见，有些党委宣传部门长期忽视教育工作、放松甚至放弃对学校教育工作的领导，已经造成了十分严重的恶果。
    我们必须从这件事情中吸取教训。各级党委宣传部门，必须加强对小学教师、文教干部的政治领导，特别要对他们加强文教政策的教育。事实已雄辩地说明了，如果党委对某项工作放松了领导，那末，这项工作便势必发生问题。因此加强党委对农村小学教育工作的领导，这是整顿小学教育、办好农村小学的根本关键。
