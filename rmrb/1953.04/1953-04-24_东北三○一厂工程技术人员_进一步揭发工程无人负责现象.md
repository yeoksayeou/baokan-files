Northeast Factory 301 Engineering Technicians
Further Expose the Phenomenon of No One Being Responsible for the Project

Serious waste occurred during the construction of the Northeast Factory 301 project (see the second page of this newspaper on April 18). Recently, relevant personnel from the factory and the construction unit held a symposium, using the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, to further expose the chaotic situation of no one being responsible during construction and the serious bureaucratic work style of the project负责人. They examined the mistakes in their own work and pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in the current work, which urgently need to be greatly improved in the movement against construction waste and against no one being responsible.

At the meeting, everyone agreed that the serious chaotic situation of no one being responsible in the work is the main reason for the low quality of the project and a large amount of waste. Deputy Engineer Li Dusheng said: Such an important project has never had a systematic plan, and it has been changed eleven times in the middle. We don't know what to do tomorrow, and we don't know what to do next month. The organizational structure and personnel are also constantly changing. Every time a person in charge is replaced, the organizational form changes once. None of the technical personnel is responsible for a job from beginning to end. I have changed jobs six times, and technician Li Jie has been transferred eight times. Almost all the staff have changed jobs seven or eight times. Therefore, if the project is done badly, no one can be held responsible. Technician Li Jie pointed out: No one is responsible and there is a lack of planning, which makes everyone work blindly. The project only officially started in the third quarter of last year, but the preparation work was very poor. The project goals were vague, the workers were not well trained, and the construction organization was not studied. They just started working without thinking. The construction of a workshop was only decided to be carried out in winter in December. At that time, there was insufficient understanding of the complexity of winter construction, and no preparations were made. So, they started working in a muddled way, which often led to shutdowns and caused serious losses.

The idea of simply pursuing progress and neglecting quality is also an important reason for the waste. Huang Rongshu, a technician from the electrical workshop, said: At that time, the leaders' idea was "progress first, quality second." There was never a meeting to discuss how to ensure project quality, and no technical personnel were responsible for project quality inspection. The workers who poured concrete did not follow the specifications and did whatever they wanted, and even put wood and steel plates in it. At this time, the leaders insisted on implementing piece-rate wages regardless of the conditions. Because the operating procedures were not sound and there was no quality inspection system, the piece-rate wage system only promoted the phenomenon of everyone working hard to catch up with the work. As a result, the quality of the project became worse and worse, and the rework was also paid by the piece. Some projects were reworked five times, and the workers received piece-rate wages five times in a row.

Ignoring political work and ideological work is a fatal flaw in construction. Deputy Engineer Li Dusheng said: The political leadership on the construction site is too weak, the staff is ideologically confused, and the technical personnel are not united. The leaders did not pay attention to solving these problems in time. The political study on the construction site was extremely poor (and was simply canceled later), and criticism and self-criticism were not often carried out on the fixed meeting system. They just relied on administrative orders to do things. Technician Li Jie also pointed out: The workers were hastily gathered together, their composition was complex, and their thoughts were chaotic, but the leaders did not strengthen political and ideological education for the workers, which resulted in extremely poor labor discipline.

At the symposium, everyone pointed out that the root cause of the above-mentioned chaotic situation is that the project leaders have serious bureaucracy. The leading cadres never went deep into the construction site to understand the situation and solve problems. Sometimes, when the problems were reported from below, they were delayed in being solved. Fu Changling, the section chief of the Engineering Management Section of Factory 301, said that he had repeatedly reported the poor quality of the project to the leaders and wrote three written reports, which were sent to the factory director, the Party committee, and the construction site director, but the leaders had been ignoring them. What is more serious is that the leading cadres have been disunited for a long time and have been engaged in unprincipled disputes, which has had a very serious impact on the work. At that time, Zhang Ge, the construction site director (director of Factory 301), also did not take the responsibility of unified leadership. The Party Committee of Factory 301 knew about this serious situation, but did not resolutely launch an ideological struggle.

While criticizing the leadership's work, the relevant personnel attending the meeting also examined their own shortcomings and mistakes. Deputy Engineer Li Dusheng examined that he was not responsible enough for the national construction cause. Because he had a bad relationship with the deputy director of the construction site, Lan Fulie, he became emotional and asked for leave to go to Shenyang when the project was very tight, and he was unwilling to take more responsibility. When the superior came to inspect, he was afraid of being punished, and several times he requested to be transferred, thinking that "this project is too risky and I can't stand it." Finally, he expressed his determination to correct his shortcomings, work with peace of mind, and do a good job in the construction work entrusted to him by the country.

At the symposium, everyone also pointed out that although there have been some improvements after the superior inspected the project of Factory 301, the chaotic situation is still quite serious, and the attention of relevant leaders must be paid. For example, the installation company currently has 2,500 workers, but only 600 to 700 are enough for the whole year, and most workers will have no work to do throughout the year. Last year, more than 30,000 workers were idle in one quarter, and this year it will be even more serious. This year's tasks have not been well arranged, and the drawings are still in the office, and have not been taken to the technical personnel and workers for research and discussion. Various necessary systems in the construction have not been established or are very unsound. Quality standards, technical responsibility system, operating procedures, construction general records, independent quality inspection system and institutions must be quickly established or improved to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible and ensure the victorious completion of this year's project tasks.

### 东北三○一厂工程技术人员  进一步揭发工程无人负责现象

    东北三○一厂工程技术人员
    进一步揭发工程无人负责现象
    东北三○一厂工程施工中发生严重浪费现象（见本报四月十八日第二版）。最近该厂厂方和施工单位有关人员举行了一次座谈会，以批评与自我批评精神，进一步揭发了施工中无人负责的混乱状况与工程负责人的严重官僚主义作风，检讨了自己工作中的错误，并指出目前工作中仍然存在着很多缺点，亟需在反对施工浪费及反对无人负责的运动中大力改进。
    会上大家一致认为：工作中严重的无人负责的混乱状况，是造成工程质量低劣和大量浪费的主要原因。副工程师李笃生说：这样重要的工程始终没有一个系统的计划，中途变动了十一次，今天不知道明天做什么，这个月不知道下个月做什么。组织机构和人事也不断变动，换一个负责人，就变一次组织形式，技术人员没有一个自始到终负责一项工作的。我曾先后换了六次工作，技术员李杰曾调动了八次。工作人员几乎都曾调换七、八次工作。因此，工程做坏了，找不到负责任的人。技术员李杰指出：无人负责和缺乏计划，就使大家都盲目地进行工作，工程到去年第三季度才正式开始，可是准备工作却作得很差，工程目标模糊，工人队伍没有很好训练，施工组织没有研究，说干就干。某车间工程到十二月份才决定进行冬季施工，当时对冬季施工的复杂性认识不足，未作什么准备，就稀里糊涂地干了起来，以致经常停工，造成严重损失。
    单纯追求进度忽视质量的思想，也是造成浪费的重要原因。电气车间技术员黄荣书说：当时领导思想是“进度第一，质量第二”，从没有开会研究如何保证工程质量，也没有技术人员负责工程质量检查。打混凝土的工人也不按规格，随意乱干，甚至把木板、钢板都打了进去。这时，领导上又不顾条件硬性地规定推行计件工资，由于操作规程不健全，没有质量检查制度，计件工资制只促成了大家拚命赶工的现象，结果工程质量愈做愈坏，返工活也计件拿钱，有的工程返工五次，工人就连续领了五次计件工资。
    忽视政治工作和思想工作，是施工中的致命缺点。副工程师李笃生说：工地政治领导太薄弱，工作人员中思想混乱，技术人员闹不团结，领导上都未及时注意解决。工地上政治学习极差（后来干脆取消了），也没有在固定的会议制度上经常展开批评与自我批评，只是单纯依靠行政命令办事。技术员李杰也指出：工人队伍是仓促集中起来的，成份复杂，思想纷乱，但领导上却不加强对工人的政治思想教育，以致劳动纪律极坏。
    座谈会上大家指出：造成以上种种混乱状况的根源，是工程领导人有严重的官僚主义。领导干部从来没有深入工地去了解情况，解决问题，下边把问题反映上来，有时也拖着不解决。三○一厂工程管理科股长富常龄说，他曾数次把工程质量不好的情况反映给领导上，并写了三份书面报告，送给厂长、党委和工地主任，可是领导上一直不理。更严重的是领导干部长期的不团结，闹无原则纠纷，使工作受到极严重影响。当时工地主任（三○一厂厂长）张戈也没有负起统一领导的责任，三○一厂党委知道这种严重情况，也没有坚决地展开思想斗争。
    在批评领导工作的同时，出席会议的有关人员也检讨了自己的缺点和错误。副工程师李笃生检讨了自己对国家建设事业不够负责，由于和工地副主任蓝伏枥关系搞不好，便闹情绪，在工程十分紧张时请假去沈阳，不愿多负责任。当上级来检查时又害怕受处分，几次要求调动工作，认为“这个工程风险太大，吃不消”。最后他表示决心改正缺点，安心工作，把国家交给自己的建设工作做好。
    座谈会上大家还提出：三○一厂工程经上级检查后虽有某些改进，但混乱状况还相当严重，必须引起有关领导上的注意。例如安装公司现有工人二千五百人，可是全年只要六、七百人足够，大部分工人今年全年将没工作可做。去年一个季度窝工三万多个，今年将更严重。今年的任务也还没有好好排队，图纸至今还搁在办公室里，没有拿到技术人员和工人中去研究讨论，施工中各种必要的制度还没有建立或很不健全。质量标准、技术责任制、操作规程、施工总记录、独立的质量检查制度和机构，都必须迅速设法建立或健全起来，以消灭无人负责现象，确保今年工程任务的胜利完成。
