How to Ensure the Marriage Law Propaganda Work Does Not Hinder Production
    Wang Quansun

Hangkou Township, a key agricultural production township in Tunxi City, Anhui Province, implemented the spirit of "production is the overriding central task" in the Marriage Law implementation movement, achieving a great success of not hindering production while implementing the Marriage Law.

Hangkou Township's working method began by addressing the ideology of the cadres. When the Marriage Law propaganda began, the township's production tasks were quite heavy: spring plowing, spring repair, spring planting, prevention of animal plague..., cadres and masses were generally afraid that implementing the Marriage Law would affect production. The work team, at village cadre meetings, mutual aid team leader meetings, and meetings of production cooperatives, water conservancy, preferential treatment, health, etc., emphasized the importance of production work, and explained that implementing the Marriage Law would not only not hinder production, but would further promote production and work, breaking through the cadres' ideology. Then, a working method was studied. Under the principle of not disrupting the original work plan and steps, the importance and urgency of various tasks were distinguished, cadres were rationally divided, and various work teams were merged into a large group, putting forward the slogan "Propagating the Marriage Law while focusing on production tasks," unifying the cadres' thinking and work steps. Through this series of meetings and specific deployments, the cadres realized that production work and the implementation of the Marriage Law could be combined, stabilizing their emotions.

Training of cadres was also combined with production. The slogan put forward was "Learning cannot affect production," and "Learning while working." Township cadres who were detached from production used the time in the morning and evening to collectively study documents, and conducted inspections based on the contents of the Supplementary Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. For the study of other cadres, the work team gave reports at various meetings. They used morning and evening rest time to study documents and organized informal talks. During the study period, an enlarged cadre meeting, a propagandist, and a Communist Youth League member meeting were convened to explain the Marriage Law policy and the relationship between the Marriage Law and production. After study, the cadres' ideology was improved, and the past erroneous understandings and vague viewpoints were criticized. In addition, the Communist Youth League members were organized to study. There were twenty-three Communist Youth League members in the township, who often read the Marriage Law documents, and the work team used the League class time on Fridays to explain the Marriage Law. They played a great role in the study and later in the propaganda to the masses.

Propaganda to the masses was also closely combined with production. When propagandizing to the masses, production was discussed first, followed by the Marriage Law. For organized farmers, such as farmers in mutual aid teams and production cooperatives, the method of "adding a lesson" was adopted during evening work evaluation and point recording to promote the Marriage Law. The propaganda to the general public was carried out by grassroots cadres, Communist Youth League members, and propagandists as the backbone, distributed to various natural villages, using the time when the masses were producing and resting to explain the Marriage Law propaganda outline. The work team propagandized to the elderly who did not participate in production, and also held photo exhibitions and showed slides. In addition, mass meetings were held in sections during production gaps, using local actual examples to illustrate the disadvantages of old marriages and the advantages of new marriages. After the meetings, small-scale informal talks were organized during the masses' rest time to further educate the masses. After such propaganda, the general public distinguished the boundaries between the old and new marriage systems and realized the benefits of the Marriage Law. Fang Guixiang's mother from Youxi Village arranged her daughter's marriage, and when her daughter refused, she threatened to die; after being educated, she knew that arranged marriages were wrong, and she firmly stated that she would no longer interfere with her daughter's marriage. Some women who were persecuted by feudal marriages also gained the courage to fight against unreasonable feudal marriage systems after being educated by the Marriage Law. For example, Wang Shundi's stepfather wanted to marry her to Xu Dongjiu, which she was unwilling to do, but did not dare to mention in the past. Now that she understood the principles, she said: "The Marriage Law is really good, I can be independent."

Because Hangkou Township's propaganda of the Marriage Law was well combined with production, not only were the masses educated by the Marriage Law and their awareness improved, but also production was promoted. During the propaganda of the Marriage Law, spring repair, spring plowing, and spring planting were carried out as usual. During this period, more than thirty-four mu of rice seedlings were transplanted, six hundred and forty-four mu of wheat fields were weeded, one hundred and ten mu of soybeans were planted, a pond was repaired, and fourteen mutual aid teams were rectified. Because the principle of equality between men and women was propagandized in the implementation of the Marriage Law, women were able to achieve equal pay for equal work in mutual aid teams. In the past, some women did not like to work, but now they have become active. Woman Fan Guixian used to think it was ugly to carry manure and accumulate fertilizer, but now she actively accumulates fertilizer. Woman Wu Langxian used to not work and completely depended on her husband; after being educated by the Marriage Law, she joined the mutual aid team, actively worked, and was rated "eight points" (the highest being ten points). The elderly reflected: In the past, men and women were not equal, and women did not go to the fields, but now women go to the fields and can get points, and production will definitely increase. The Marriage Law is really good! Now Hangkou Township is further eliminating the "blank spots" and "blank people" in the propaganda, so that the Marriage Law will be known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

    怎样才能使宣传贯彻婚姻法工作不妨碍生产
    王权荪
    安徽省屯溪市农业生产重点乡杭口乡，在贯彻婚姻法运动中，贯彻了“生产是压倒一切的中心任务”的精神，做到贯彻婚姻法与生产两不误，取得了很大成绩。
    杭口乡的工作方法首先是从解决干部思想入手。宣传婚姻法开始时，该乡生产任务相当繁重：春耕，春修，春种，预防兽瘟……，干部、群众普遍害怕贯彻婚姻法会影响生产。工作组在乡村干部会议、互助组长会议及生产合作社、水利、优抚、卫生等会议上，强调指出生产工作的重要，并说明贯彻婚姻法不但不会妨碍生产，且会进一步推动生产与工作，打通干部思想。然后研究工作办法，在不打乱原来工作计划与步骤的原则下，分别各种工作的轻重缓急，干部作合理分工，把各种工作队合并成一大组，提出“在围绕生产任务下宣传婚姻法”的口号，统一了干部的思想和工作步骤。通过这一系列的会议及具体部署，使干部认识到生产工作与贯彻婚姻法可以结合进行，稳定了情绪。
    训练干部也是结合生产进行的。提出的口号是“学习不能影响生产”，“边学习边做活”。一般不集中学习。脱离生产的乡干部利用早晚时间集体学习文件，并根据中共中央补充指示的内容进行检查。其他干部的学习，由工作组在各种会上作报告。利用早晚休息时间学习文件，组织漫谈。在学习期间，召开了干部扩大会议，宣传员、青年团员会议，讲解婚姻政策，说明婚姻法与生产的关系。经过学习，干部思想得到提高，批判了过去的错误认识和模糊观点。此外又组织了青年团员的学习。该乡共有青年团员二十三人，经常阅读婚姻法文件，工作组并利用星期五的团课时间讲解婚姻法。他们在学习中和后来向群众宣传中都起了很大作用。
    向群众宣传，也是紧密结合生产进行的。向群众宣传先讲生产，后讲婚姻法。对组织起来的农民，如互助组、生产合作社的农民，利用晚上评工记分时间采用“加上一课”的办法，宣传婚姻法。对一般群众的宣传，是以基层干部、青年团员、宣传员为骨干，分布到各自然村，利用群众生产及休息时间，讲解婚姻法宣传提纲。工作组向不参加生产的老年人宣传，并举办了图片展览，放映了幻灯。另外，在生产空隙，还分段召开了群众大会，用当地实际事例说明旧婚姻的坏处和新婚姻的好处。会后又利用群众休息时间，组织小型漫谈会，进一步教育群众。经过这样的宣传一般群众都分清了新旧婚姻制度的界限，认识到婚姻法的好处。尤溪村方桂香的母亲包办女儿的婚姻，女儿不肯，她便以死来威胁；受到教育后，知道包办婚姻是不对的，她坚决表示再也不干涉女儿的婚姻了。有些受封建婚姻迫害的妇女受到婚姻法的教育后也增加了向不合理的封建婚姻制度进行斗争的勇气。如汪顺娣的继父要把她嫁给徐冬九，她心里不愿，过去不敢提出来，现在懂得了道理，说：“婚姻法真好，我可以自主了。”
    由于杭口乡的宣传婚姻法与生产结合得好，不但群众受到婚姻法的教育，提高了觉悟，而且推动了生产。在宣传婚姻法中，春修春耕春种工作照常紧张进行。这期间共插秧三十四亩多，锄麦田草六百四十四亩，种大豆一百一十亩，修好一口塘，并整顿好十四个互助组。由于在贯彻婚姻法中宣传了男女平等的道理，使妇女在互助组里做到同工同酬。过去有些妇女不爱劳动，现在也积极起来了。妇女樊桂仙过去觉得挑大粪积肥很丑，现在她积极积肥。妇女吴琅仙过去不劳动，完全依赖丈夫；受到婚姻法的教育后，参加了互助组，积极劳动，评得“八分”（最高的十分）。老年人都反映：过去男女不平等，女人不下田，现在女的下田又能评分，生产一定能提高。婚姻法真是好！现在杭口乡正进一步消灭宣传中的“空白点”，“空白人”，要使婚姻法达到家喻户晓，深入人心。
