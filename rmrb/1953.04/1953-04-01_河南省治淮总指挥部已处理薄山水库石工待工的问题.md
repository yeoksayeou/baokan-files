    Henan Province's Huai River Harnessing Headquarters Has Addressed the Issue of Stone Workers' Idle Time at Boshan Reservoir
    Letter from Henan Province's Huai River Harnessing Headquarters: "The People's Daily published on February 20th a reader's criticism about the chaotic work at the Boshan Reservoir construction site, which resulted in over a hundred workers being idle for twenty-seven days. After seeing the newspaper, we immediately instructed the Boshan Reservoir Command to conduct a swift investigation and deal with the matter. They have now made a self-criticism. The main reason for the stone workers' idleness was that the Boshan Reservoir's work plan was not thorough, the preparatory work was not done well, and the tools were not transferred from the Baisha Reservoir in a timely manner. With the consent of the Provincial Labor Bureau and the Trade Union, our department has decided to pay the workers during their idle time 75% of the average daily work equivalent of the stone workers' actual wages (deducting gunpowder, wage fees, etc.). After the formal work begins, everything will be carried out according to the contract. According to the report from Boshan Reservoir, this has already been implemented."

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    河南省治淮总指挥部已处理薄山水库石工待工的问题
    河南省治淮总指挥部来信：二月二十日人民日报刊载了读者对薄山水库施工处工作混乱，使百余工人待工二十七天的批评。我们看到报纸后当即让薄山水库指挥部迅速检查处理。现在他们已作出检讨。该批石工待工的主要原因是薄山水库工作计划不周，准备工作做得不好，工具未能及时由白沙水库调来。我部已征求省劳动局、工会同意，决定工人待工时的工资按石工每日平均工效应实得工资
    （扣除火药、工资费等）的百分之七十五发给。正式工作开始后，一切照合同执行。据薄山水库报告已照此执行。
