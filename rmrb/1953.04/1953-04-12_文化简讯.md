    Wuhan Basic Construction Workers' Cultural Service Team Deeply Engages in Various Recreational Activities on Construction Sites

    The Basic Construction Workers' Cultural Service Team organized by Wuhan City has been deeply engaged in assisting workers in carrying out various recreational activities on construction sites. For example, the Third Work Zone of the Municipal Engineering Company, under the guidance of the service team, established a club and organized a workers' cultural troupe, which performed its own creations - "Apprentice Contract," "Marriage Law Crosstalk," and other programs. The three film teams dispatched by the service team screened eighteen films including "Be Sure to Harness the Huai River," "A Spring in Two Families," and "The Great Battle of Stalingrad" for a total of one hundred and four screenings on twenty-four construction sites such as the Hankou Chenjiaji Petroleum Company, the Hanyang Sleeper Preservative Factory, and the Wuchang East Lake Postal and Telecommunications Water Conservancy School, with over 84,000 viewers from February 20th to the end of March. The team has a mobile library group that circulates to various construction sites and has arranged for Xinhua Bookstore and China Book Distribution Company to set up book supply groups on construction sites, successively supplying books to various sites. The Wuhan Science Popularization Association and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also supplied the service team with twelve sets of pictures such as "Huai River Harnessing Project" and "Moscow High-Rise Buildings" for exhibitions on various construction sites.

    In the future, the team plans to do the following work: 1. Collect advanced working methods and deeds of model figures on construction sites to make into pictures and slides; 2. Organize existing basic construction worker troupes to tour larger construction sites; 3. Strive to ensure that workers on construction sites with more than 500 people watch a movie once a week, a drama every two weeks, and attend a science lecture once every two weeks. In addition, the team also plans to help various construction sites universally establish clubs so that basic construction workers can participate in mass recreational activities.

    "Uyghur-Chinese-Russian Dictionary" Published

    China's first Uyghur, Chinese, and Russian trilingual "Uyghur-Chinese-Russian Dictionary" has recently been published by the Nationalities Publishing House. This dictionary was compiled by Uyghur linguist Burhan in 1942 based on the "Uyghur-Russian Dictionary" compiled by Baskakov of the Soviet Union. The book has more than 800 pages, including more than 12,000 vocabulary words in politics, economics, military affairs, culture, art, science, medicine, and other fields. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the culture of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang was discriminated against and devastated, and the original manuscript of this dictionary could not be printed. Now, under the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong's ethnic policy, this dust-laden manuscript has become a beautifully bound book. Uyghur is a relatively common language among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In the past, people who studied Uyghur relied on their own long-term accumulation, classification, and transcription of various vocabulary words because there was no relatively complete dictionary, which took a lot of time. The publication of this dictionary provides a tool for the Uyghur people to learn their own language and also provides favorable conditions for cultural exchange among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    Correction

    Notice from the Central Election Committee Office: In the "Population Survey Registration Form (Form A)," "City (County)" in the second line on the left should be changed to "County (City)"; in the "Population Survey Registration Form (Form B)," the word "No." should be added under "House Number" in the third line on the left; in the "Instructions for Filling Out the Population Survey Registration Form," item 18, section 3, "'Household Number'," should be deleted.

    武汉市基本建设工人文化服务队深入工地开展各种文娱活动
    武汉市组织的基本建设工人文化服务队已深入工地协助工人开展各种文娱活动。如市工程公司第三工区在服务队的辅导下建立了俱乐部，并组织了工人文工队，演出了自己的创作——“师徒合同”、
    “婚姻法相声”等节目。服务队派出的三个电影队，从二月二十日到三月底在汉口谌家矶石油公司、汉阳枕木防腐厂、武昌东湖邮电水利学校等二十四个工地上放映了“一定要把淮河修好”、“两家春”、“斯大林格勒大血战”等十八部影片共一百零四场，观众八万四千多人。该队有流动图书组在各工地流动，并约新华书店和中国图书发行公司设立工地图书供应组，先后到各工地供应图书。武汉市科学普及协会、中苏友好协会并供给服务队以“治淮工程”、“莫斯科高楼房”等十二套图片在各工地展览。
    今后，该队还计划作以下一些工作：一、收集工地先进工作法及模范人物事迹等制成图片及幻灯片；二、组织现有基本建设工人剧团到较大工地巡回演出；三、争取在五百人以上的工地，工人每周看一次电影，每两周看一次戏剧、听一次科学讲座。此外，该队还计划帮助各工地普遍建立俱乐部，使基本建设工人都能参加群众性的文娱活动。“维汉俄辞典”出版
    我国第一本维吾尔文、汉文、俄罗斯文对照的“维汉俄辞典”，最近由民族出版社出版了。这部辞典是由维吾尔族语文学者鲍尔汉，在一九四二年根据苏联巴斯卡科夫所编的“维俄辞典”编译而成。全书共八百多页，包括政治、经济、军事、文化、艺术、科学、医药等各种词汇一万二千多个。在国民党反动统治时期，新疆各民族的文化受到歧视和摧残，这部辞典的原稿一直不能付印。现在，在毛泽东民族政策光辉的照耀下，这本落满灰尘的原稿变成了装帧精美的书。维吾尔文是新疆各民族间比较通行的文字，过去学习维吾尔文的人，因为没有比较完善的辞典，各种词汇全靠自己长期积累、分类编抄，费时很多。这部辞典的出版，使得维吾尔族人民学习本民族文字有了工具，对新疆各民族文化的交流也提供了有利条件。更正中央选举委员会办公室通知：“人口调查登记表（甲式）”左旁第二行内“市（县）”应改为“县（市）”；“人口调查登记表（乙式）”左旁第三行内“门牌”下应加“第”字；“人口调查登记表填写说明”第十八条第三款“‘户号’、”应删去。（以上见本报四月六日第二版）
