Editor's Note: The author of this article analyzes the production situation in various enterprises in Northeast China, especially the machinery industry, and emphatically proposes the necessity of organizing balanced production. This opinion is correct. Organizing balanced production should be the central requirement for all factories and mines across the country in improving production management in the coming period. In order to achieve rhythmic and balanced production, the production preparation work mentioned in this article, such as improving technical management, strengthening machinery maintenance and repair, and strengthening material supply, are indispensable. However, it is impossible for us to carry out so many tasks simultaneously in one period, let alone do all these tasks well. Therefore, we must grasp the main links and proceed step by step. The fundamental link that all factories and mines must grasp at present is the formulation of work plans. Factories and mines with a good foundation can gradually improve their existing work plans to make them more accurate and complete. Factories and mines with a poor foundation can first try to formulate a work plan for one workshop, and then gradually extend it to the entire factory. Although the foundations of all factories and mines across the country are different, the need to strengthen planning management is the same. We are publishing this article here for the reference of leading comrades of all factories and mines.

The Serious Imbalance in Production

    In 1952, Northeast China's industrial production completed 110.7 percent of the state plan and 176.4 percent of the increased production and conservation plan. The total output value of various major products exceeded the 1943 level by 23.2 percent.

    However, this does not mean that the management of all enterprises has been done well. Taking the factories and mines under the former Northeast Industrial Department system as an example, an average of 43 percent of the factories and mines failed to complete their monthly plans each month. In particular, in the first month of each quarter, more than half of the factories and mines failed to complete their monthly plans. This situation is even more serious in local state-owned enterprises, with an average of 70 percent of factories and mines failing to complete their monthly plans each month.

    One of the main reasons why these enterprises failed to complete the state plan is that their production is uneven: First, loose at the beginning of the year and tight at the end of the year. For example, taking the total output value of the fourth quarter of 1951 as 100, the total output value of the first quarter of 1952 decreased to 94.6 percent. Taking the total output value of the first quarter as 100, the total output value of the fourth quarter rose to 135.1 percent. Second, loose at the beginning of the quarter and tight at the end of the quarter. For example, taking the average total output value of the first month of each quarter (January, April, July, and October) as 100, the total output value of the last month of the quarter (March, June, September, and December) is 117 percent. Some of the third months of each quarter even increased by 25 percent compared to the first month. Third, loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month. The output in the last ten days of each month often exceeds the output in the first ten days by one to four or five times, and some even exceed it by more than ten times. Taking the output of machine tools in Northeast China as an example, if the average output in the first ten days of each month is 100, the output in the last ten days is 413.9; for electric motors, the average in the first ten days is 100, and the output in the last ten days is 587.2; for hoists, the average in the first ten days is 100, and the output in the last ten days is 1010.

    Due to the "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" nature of production, downtime generally accounts for about 10 percent of the total production time, and some even reach more than 20 percent. The equipment utilization rate can only reach 60 to 70 percent, and some only reach 40 percent. Many enterprise leaders have not made efforts to change this uneven production phenomenon. In order to complete the task, they only know how to increase labor intensity by working overtime, and some even violate the state's labor policies to unilaterally complete the state's output targets. In the fourth quarter of last year, some workshops in Liaoxi Province continuously worked for more than 16 hours a day for half a month, and some workers worked 24 hours a day. As a result, the injury and illness rate of workers increased, the machine repair rate increased, and product quality declined. The scrap rate of one factory in April was 2 percent, but it rose to 3.7 percent in June. In one factory, the number of reworked products in September reached 60 to 75 percent. This increased costs, affected the completion of output tasks, and caused huge losses to the state.

Several Main Reasons for Unbalanced Production

    1. Inaccurate work plans. Work plans are the main condition for ensuring the rhythmic completion and over-completion of state production, technology, and financial plans. However, the work plans of many of our enterprises are not realistic; not only can they not guide production, but they also prevent production from proceeding smoothly. The main reason for the inaccuracy of work plans is, first of all, the inaccuracy of quotas. Instead of formulating average advanced quotas based on the actual working hours of workers, they are estimated statistical quotas. Therefore, the production schedule is out of touch with the actual operating time of workers. One factory planned to process a certain component in one month, but completed it in half a month. Due to the uneven length of working hours, some parts were backlogged, and some processes were stopped due to lack of materials. If the working hour quota is inaccurate, it is impossible to accurately calculate the machine-hour rate. Therefore, in the use of equipment, some put small jobs on large machines, and some put large jobs on small machines; some jobs that should be done by three lathes are assigned to only two or even four lathes. This not only fails to fully utilize the efficiency of the equipment, but also causes extreme imbalances in production. If the machine-hour rate is inaccurate, there is no correct machine repair plan, or even no plan at all. They just blindly rush to complete tasks, resulting in increased downtime due to machine accidents, which cannot but break the established processing time. If the working hour quota is inaccurate, the use of labor is also incorrect. There are too many or too few workers in various types of work. Low-level workers do high-level work, and high-level workers do low-level work. This wastes labor, and the phenomenon of imbalance in production occurs at any time. Secondly, the work plan is not timely. The monthly production plan of our enterprise management generally arrives at the workshop at the end of the previous month or the beginning of the current month, which seriously affects the preparation of materials and tools. In addition, the lack of tools and raw materials, or even the lack of a correct quota management system, causes the phenomenon of waiting for materials and tools in the workshop. In October, one factory wasted 7,686 working hours just waiting for tools, another factory waited 1,681 working hours for materials, and some workers spent eight working hours just looking for tools in one working day. This further promoted the confusion in production and made it impossible to complete the scheduled plan according to the scheduled working hours.

    2. Unreasonable production organization. There are two types of production organization in the workshop. One is backward, which organizes similar machines into workshops or sections according to their production purpose and usage, such as forging sections, turning sections, and milling sections. The other is advanced, which comprehensively organizes sections or groups according to the types and quantities of machinery required to manufacture a certain type of product.

    At present, the production organization of many of our enterprises still follows the old form, so there are many unreasonable phenomena: First, the production relationship is not close at all. Each process can only be responsible for each process. There is no relationship between processes. It is not possible and impossible to be fully responsible for the entire part or component. For example, if the lathe worker scraps it, the milling worker does not consider it, and there is no possibility of considering it. Second, the turnover of parts or components is very complicated, and there is a serious waste of time and space. For example, a factory processed 20 drill rods, a part of a drilling machine, with a total of eight processes. What is their turnover? Sixteen round trips to the engineering management team, taking 29 days, 13 inspections, taking 7 and a half days, plus operating time, a total of about 60 days, but the actual manufacturing time only takes 23 days. For each type of part, from the time the material is put in, no one can control where it flows to during the entire production process. It is not until the end of the month that the approximate output can be known, and the uncompleted parts still cannot be known when they will be completed. The leadership is clueless. Third, under such an organization, in order to achieve balance in production, some factories have to take the method of putting in more materials and asking for fewer tasks to cope with the next production link. Therefore, on the one hand, the amount of production occupied is large and funds are backlogged, and on the other hand, the phenomenon of imbalance in production is more prominent.

    3. Poor technical management. The quality of technical management is related to the quality of products and is also an important factor in balanced production. Because each link in production is interdependent, if a defective product occurs in one process, the next process will be stopped. However, we not only often have defective products, but the number of defective products fluctuates greatly. This makes it impossible for the work plan to accurately grasp its laws and formulate an accurate production schedule, and production interruptions become inevitable. There are several main problems in technical management: First, the quality standards are not clear, the design is not accurate, and there are even more errors in the drawings. One factory had more than 900 errors in three drawings. As a result, the drawings are often modified and defective products are often produced. Second, there is no implementation or no operating procedures at all. Therefore, the quality of many important components cannot be guaranteed. Third, the inspection system is lax. The inspection of many components does not start from the first one, but is carried out or sampled after the entire batch is backlogged, which prolongs the time and causes downtime due to lack of materials; or the inspection is not strict, and defective products are discovered only during processing, causing intermediate downtime.

Several Suggestions on Promoting Balanced Production

    1. Strengthen work planning. The key to whether the work plan is accurate is whether the working hour quota is accurate. In order to correctly formulate advanced quotas, on the one hand, we must strengthen original records and conduct in-depth education among workers, and launch in-depth discussions. On the basis of the workers' conscious awareness, we must turn advanced quotas into the workers' own quotas. At the same time, planning working hours must always pay attention to the advanced experience of workers and revise them in a timely manner to make them consistent with the actual operations of workers.

    2. Improve production organization and change the old organizational form in a planned way. Taking a mechanical factory as an example, the same types of parts in the processing process can be classified and divided into sections, such as large parts, shaft-shaped parts, wheel-shaped parts, standard parts, and miscellaneous parts. In each section, the groups are divided by product unit. After the advanced plan is determined, a certain number of workers of different types of work are assigned according to the different types of work and working hours required for various parts; a certain number of different machines are equipped according to the different machine tools and machine hours required for various parts; the machine positions are appropriately adjusted according to the processing sequence of various parts to match the process. Of course, the attendance rate and technical proficiency of workers, the machine repair rate and its accuracy, as well as the product scrap rate and reserves, must also be fully and accurately statistically. Experience has proved that this organizational form has the following advantages: First, because the processes are closely linked, the product turnaround route is shortened, and the production cycle and process occupancy are reduced, which can reduce the working capital of the workshop. For example, in the first month of implementing the reform in one section of a factory, the gear cycle was reduced from 67 days to 36 days, the process occupancy was reduced from 140 units to 100 units in the past, and the working capital was reduced from more than 559 million yuan to 300 million yuan in the past. Second, the production relationship between sections or groups and workers, which is based on the completion of products, is strengthened, which also enhances their sense of responsibility for completing tasks and mutual supervision. Third, because of fixed people, fixed machines, and fixed work, each worker has increased the sense of responsibility for machine maintenance, downtime is reduced, and the equipment utilization rate is improved. Fourth, the cadres are well aware of the situation and can grasp the situation in time to promote production. Fifth, it is convenient to implement workshop economic accounting. In the past, the sections or groups did not complete the products independently. Therefore, the workshop cost accounting did not know which process the materials and auxiliary materials were added to, and which process or group the cost increase or decrease was in. Therefore, it was impossible to find out the weak links that affected the cost and overcome them. After changing the production organization, the cost of each product can be calculated more accurately from the section to the group. Some factories have been successfully carrying out cost accounting that the workshop could not carry out for several years after organizing independent product sections and groups.

    3. Strengthen technical management. Strengthening technical management and improving product quality are of special significance to ensure balanced production, especially in the case of mass production of new products. Therefore, first, we must strengthen quality standards, especially the responsibility system for design and drawings. There must be a clear division of labor among technical personnel, and a clear reward and punishment system must be established. Second, operating procedures must be conscientiously implemented among workers. Incorrect operating procedures must be revised in a timely manner, and advanced operating methods must be summarized in a timely manner and conscientiously promoted. Third, the inspection system must be effectively implemented. Unreasonable fixed inspection positions and a large number of inspection methods must be changed to mobile and piece-by-piece inspection systems. Not only is it a passive inspection, but it is also necessary to study the causes of defective products and propose corrective opinions.

    4. Do a good job in production preparation. In addition to making timely supply and repair plans according to the needs of production, especially materials, tools, and machine repairs, we must carefully check the specifications and quality of materials. Substandard materials not only affect product quality, but also often change production time and affect rhythmic production. We must do a good job in the consumption quota and usage system of tools, organize the balanced production of tool workshops, learn from the Soviet machine repair method of fixing machines and people, and implement a progressive reward system to reduce or eliminate downtime.

    5. Promote advanced production experience. So-called balanced production can only be relatively balanced, not absolutely balanced. In the process of continuous production, due to the gradual improvement of workers' skills and the continuous emergence of tricks, the phenomenon of imbalance will continue to occur, which is inevitable. Therefore, balanced production must be closely coordinated with the promotion of advanced production experience to continuously improve backward links and promote production progress.

    6. Strengthen the political work of the departments and overcome bureaucracy in leadership. The work of our departments is very weak, and the phenomenon of shirk responsibility and not being responsible to each other is everywhere. When one factory approved a certain construction fund, the factory director approved it to the material section, the material section transferred it to the marketing and sales section, and the marketing and sales section pushed it to the administrative section. This shows the need to strengthen political education for the staff of the departments, so that they can establish a working attitude of relying on the conscious and voluntary service of workers for the people.

    In order to educate employees, enterprise leaders must overcome the style of focusing on routine work and bureaucracy. The current problems in leadership work are too many meetings and too few solutions, and a lack of in-depth and systematic inspection work. Only by linking the inspection of plans with the execution of plans can our work be continuously improved.

    对组织均衡生产的几点意见
    黄琦
    编者按：本文作者分析了东北各企业，特别是机械工业的生产情况，强调地提出了必须组织均衡生产。这个意见是正确的。组织均衡生产，应该是今后一个时期中全国各厂矿在改进生产管理方面的中心要求。为了实现有节奏的均衡的生产，本文中所提的，诸如改善技术管理、加强机械保养和检修、加强材料供应等生产准备工作等等，都是不可缺少的。但是，我们不可能在一个时期内同时进行这许多工作，更不可能把这许多工作都做好。因此，必须抓住其中的主要环节，有步骤地进行。目前各厂矿必须抓住的根本环节就是制订作业计划。基础好的厂矿，可以逐步改善已有的作业计划，使之更加准确和完备。基础差的厂矿，则可以先试订一个车间的作业计划，然后逐步推及全厂。目前全国各厂矿基础虽有所不同，但需要加强计划管理则是相同的。我们特将这篇文章发表在这里，供各厂矿领导同志参考。生产上的严重不均衡
    一九五二年东北工业生产，完成了国家计划百分之一百一十点七，完成了增产节约计划百分之一百七十六点四，各种主要产品的总产值超过一九四三年水平百分之二十三点二。
    但是这并不是说所有的企业的管理工作都作得很好了。以原东北工业部系统的厂矿来看，每月平均有百分之四十三的厂矿不能完成月计划，特别是每季之初的第一个月，竟有半数以上的厂矿不能完成月计划。这种情况在地方国营企业更为严重，平均每月有百分之七十的厂矿不能完成月计划。
    这些企业所以没有能完成国家计划的主要原因之一，是它们的生产不均匀：第一、年初松，年末紧。如以一九五一年第四季度总产值为一百，一九五二年第一季度总产值则降低为百分之九十四点六。如以第一季度总产值为一百，第四季度总产值则上升为百分之一百三十五点一。第二、季初松、季末紧。如以每季第一个月（一、四、七、十月）的总产值平均为一百，季末一月（三、六、九、十二月）的总产值则为百分之一百一十七，有的每季的第三个月份竟比第一个月份增高百分之二十五。第三、月初松月末紧。每月的下旬产量往往比上旬超过一倍至四、五倍不等，有的乃至超过十倍以上。东北工作母机的产量，如以每月上旬平均为一百，则下旬为四百一十三点九；电动机上旬平均为一百，则下旬为五百八十七点二；卷扬机上旬平均为一百，则下旬为一千零一十。
    由于生产上的前松后紧，生产的中断时间一般地占总生产时间的百分之十上下，有的则达到百分之二十以上，设备运用率只能发挥百分之六十到七十，有的只达到百分之四十。不少的企业领导者，他们没有努力去改变这种生产不均匀的现象，为了完成任务，只知采取加班加点增加劳动强度的办法，有的甚至违反国家劳动政策，片面地完成国家的产量指标。辽西省去年第四季度有的车间在半月之内每天连续作业十六小时以上，有的工人每天工作二十四小时。结果工人的伤病率提高，机修率增加，产品质量下降。有的工厂四月份的废品率是百分之二，到六月份便上升为百分之三点七。有的工厂，九月份的返修品竟达百分之六十到七十五。这就提高了成本，影响产量任务的完成，并给国家造成了巨大损失。
    生产不均衡的几个主要原因
    一、作业计划不准确。作业计划是保证有节奏地完成和超额完成国家生产、技术、财务计划的主要条件。但是我们许多企业的作业计划是不切合实际的；不仅不能指导生产，反使生产不能顺利进行。作业计划不准确的主要原因，首先是定额不准确，不是根据工人的实动工时制订平均先进定额，而是估计的统计定额，因此生产进度计划就和工人的实际操作时间脱节。有的工厂一个月加工一种部件的计划，半个月就完成了，由于工时长短不齐，就形成有的零件在积压，有的工序在停工待料。工时定额不准确，也就无法正确地计算工作台时，因而在设备的运用上，有的把小活放到大床上作，把大活反放到小床上作；有的该是三台车床的活，却只派二台或竟派四台车床加工，这不仅不能充分发挥设备的效能，而且也造成生产上的极不平衡。而台时计算不准确，就没有正确的机器检修计划，有的甚至就没有计划，只是盲目地赶任务，以致因机器事故而造成的停工现象增多，这就不能不打破既定的加工时间。工时定额不准确，劳动力的使用也不正确，在各个工种的配备上有多有少，低级工干高级活，高级工反干低级活，既浪费了劳动力，而且生产上的不均衡的现象就随时出现。其次是作业计划不及时，我们的企业管理，每月的生产计划一般是在上月之末或本月之初才到达车间，因而就严重影响材料与工具的准备工作，再加工具与原料缺乏甚至没有正确的定额管理制度，就造成了车间待料待工具现象。有的厂十月份单等工具就浪费了七千六百八十六个工时，有的厂待料一千六百八十一个工时，有的工人一个工作日单找工具就花了八个工时，这就更促成了生产上的混乱，不能按预定工时完成预定计划。
    二、生产组织不合理。车间的生产组织，一种是落后的，把同类的机器按其生产目的及使用方法组成车间或工段，如锻工段、镟工段、铣工段等。一种是先进的，按制造一定类型的产品所需要的机械种类和数量综合组成工段或小组。
    目前我们许多企业的生产组织仍然是因袭旧的形式，因此有许多不合理的现象：第一、生产上的关系极不密切，每个工序只能对每个工序负责，工序之间不发生关系，不是而且也不可能对整个的部件与零件完全负责。如车工废了，铣工不考虑，而且也无考虑可能。第二、部件或零件的周转是非常繁杂的，在时间和空间上都存在着严重的浪费现象。如有一个工厂加工钻床部件钻杆二十个，共有八道工序，它们周转是怎样呢？往返工程管理组十六次，占二十九天，检查十三次，七天半，加上操作时间，共约六十天，可是实际在制时间只需二十三天。而每一种零件，从投入材料时起，在整个生产过程中谁也掌握不住它流到哪里去了，直到月终才能大约地知道出产多少，而没有完成的部分，仍然不能知道会在什么时候完成，领导上是心中无数的。第三、在这样的组织下，有的工厂为了达到生产上的均衡，就不得不采取多投料少要任务的办法以应付下一个生产环节，因而一方面生产上的占用量大、积压了资金，另方面生产上的不均衡现象就更加突出。
    三、技术管理不善。技术管理的好坏与产品质量的好坏有关，也是均衡生产的重要因素。因为生产上的各个环节是互相依存的，一道工序出了废品，下道工序就会停工。可是我们不仅经常地出现废品，而且废品的数量是忽多忽少。就使作业计划不能准确地掌握其规律而制订准确的生产进度，生产上的中断就成为不可避免的事情。技术管理上的问题主要有以下几个方面：第一、质量标准不明确，设计不准确，特别是图纸错误更多，有一个工厂三张图纸竟有九百多处错误。于是图纸经常修改，废品经常产生。第二、没有贯彻或者根本没有操作规程。因此许多重要部件的质量就无法保证。第三、检查制度松弛，许多部件的检查，不是从第一个开始，而是整批地积压之后才进行检查或者抽查，因此拖长了时间，致停工待料；或者检查不严，直到加工时才发现废品，造成中间停工。
    关于推行均衡生产的几点意见
    一、加强作业计划工作。作业计划是否准确，其关键在于工时定额是否准确。为要正确地制定先进的定额，一方面要加强原始记录，并在工人中深入地进行教育，展开深入的讨论，在工人自觉的基础上把先进定额变为工人自己的定额。同时计划工时必须经常注意工人的先进经验，及时修正，使与工人实际操作相符合。
    二、改进生产组织，有计划地改变旧的组织形式。如以机械工厂为例，可将在加工过程中各种相同类型的零件，分别归类而划分工段，如大件、轴型、轮型、标准件、杂件等工段。在每工段中，再以产品为单位划分小组。在先进的计划确定之后，根据各种零件所需的不同的工种和工时，分配一定数量的不同工种的工人；根据各种零件所需的不同机床与台时，配备一定数量的不同机器；根据各种零件的加工的顺序，适当地调整机器位置，使与工序相称。当然工人的出勤率和技术熟练程度，机器检修率和它的精密度，以及产品的废品率和储备量等，也都要作充分的准确统计。经验证明这样的组织形式有以下几项优点：第一、由于工序紧密衔接，产品运转路程缩减，生产循环期和工序占用量都将减少，因而就可以减少车间的流动资金。如某工厂在一个工段实行改革的第一个月中，齿轮的循环期由六十七天降为三十六天，工序占用量由过去一百四十台降为一百台，流动资金由过去五亿五千九百多万元减少为三亿元。第二、由于以完成产品为单位的工段或小组之间及工人之间的生产关系加强了，同时也就增强了他们对完成任务和互相监督的责任心。第三、由于定人定机定活，每个工人都增加了对机器保养的责任心，中断时间减少，设备运用率提高。第四、干部心中有数，能及时掌握情况以推动生产。第五、便于实行车间经济核算。过去工段或小组不是单独地完成产品，因而车间的成本核算，不知道材料和辅助材料等加到哪道工序上，成本的提高或降低是在哪个工序或哪个小组里，因而也就找不出影响成本的薄弱环节而加以克服。改变了生产组织，从工段到小组都可以把每种产品的成本比较准确地计算出来，有的工厂从组织独立产品工段与小组后，已在顺利地进行几年来车间所不能进行的成本核算。
    三、加强技术管理。加强技术管理，提高产品质量，这对保证均衡生产，特别是在大量生产新产品的情况下，具有特殊意义。因此，第一、要加强质量标准，特别是加强设计与图纸的责任制。在技术人员当中，要有明确的分工，要建立明确的奖惩制度。第二、在工人中必须认真地贯彻操作规程，不正确的操作规程必须及时修正，先进的操作方法要及时总结，并认真地推广。第三、检查制度要切实执行。不合理的固定检查岗位和大量的检查方法，要改变为流动的和逐件的检查制度。不仅是消极的检查，而且要研究废品的原因，提出改正的意见。
    四、作好生产准备工作。生产上的准备工作，特别是材料、工具与机器检修，除根据生产的需要作好及时供应与检修计划外，必须认真检查材料的规格与质量，不合格的材料不仅影响产品质量，而且往往是改变生产时间影响节奏生产的重要因素。要作好工具的消耗定额与使用制度，组织工具车间的均衡生产，要学习苏联定机定人的机器检修法，实行减少或消灭中断时间的累进奖励制度。
    五、推广先进生产经验。所谓均衡生产，只能是相对的均衡，而不是绝对的均衡。在不断生产的过程中，由于工人的技术逐步提高和窍门不断出现，不均衡的现象就会不断地产生，这是必然的。因此，均衡生产必须与推广先进生产经验密切配合，不断地提高落后环节推动生产前进。
    六、加强科室的政治工作，克服领导上的官僚主义。我们的科室工作是非常薄弱的，工作互相推诿，互不负责的现象到处都有。有一个工厂在批领某项修建用款时，厂长批到材料科，材料科又批转供销科，供销科又推到行政科。这说明了需要对科室的工作人员加强政治教育，使他们树立依靠工人自觉自愿地为人民服务的劳动态度。
    为要教育职工，企业领导者必须克服事务主义和官僚主义作风，目前领导工作上的问题是会议多，解决问题少，缺乏深入而系统的检查工作。只有把计划与执行情况的检查联系起来，才会使我们的工作获得不断的改进。
