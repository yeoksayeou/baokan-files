Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: On April 9th, the U.S. side murdered another captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp, and beat to death a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp.

According to the U.S. side, the incident on Jeju Island occurred in the prisoner-of-war camp where so-called "unwilling to be repatriated" prisoners of war were detained, and the murdered prisoner of war was "possibly a Communist fanatic." The U.S. side did not provide an answer as to how this "Communist fanatic" became a prisoner of war "unwilling to be repatriated." This incident reveals the truth of the U.S. side's forced coercion of prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation," proving that the claim that three-quarters of the captured soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army "refused repatriation" is completely untrue.

    美方又谋害和打死战俘二名
    【新华社十三日讯】四月九日美方在济州岛战俘营中又谋害中国人民志愿军被俘人员一名，并且在蜂岩岛战俘营中打死朝鲜人民军被俘人员一名。
    据美方宣布，济州岛上的事件发生在拘留所谓“不愿遣返”的战俘的战俘营中，而这名被谋害的战俘却“可能是共产党狂热分子”。对这名“共产党狂热分子”怎么会成为“不愿遣返”的战俘的问题，美方却未提出答复。这个事件透露了美方强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”的真相，证明所谓有四分之三的中国人民志愿军被俘人员“拒绝遣返”的说法完全不合乎事实。
