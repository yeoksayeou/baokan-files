Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The broad masses of staff and workers at the Yongding River Guanting Reservoir construction site have greatly increased their enthusiasm for labor after participating in the anti-bureaucracy movement. The leadership structure of the Guanting Reservoir project has now been adjusted. More than 20,000 civilian laborers from Tongxian and Baoding Special Districts in Hebei Province have arrived at the construction site one after another and large-scale construction will begin soon.

This spring, an anti-bureaucracy movement was launched at the Guanting Reservoir construction site. After the broad masses of staff and workers exposed serious incidents such as delays and waste in the project, the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau resolved to improve. In mid-March, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government transferred Hao Zhizhai, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry, to serve as Director of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also sent Li Ziguang, a member of the Provincial Committee, to assist the work of the Guanting Reservoir Party Committee. In mid-March, Li Baohua, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, personally went to the Guanting Reservoir construction site for an in-depth inspection. Based on the instructions of Vice Minister Li Baohua and the opinions of the broad masses of staff and workers, the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau first made clear divisions of labor among the leading cadres, who respectively went deep into the work of leading the engineering, political, civilian labor, transportation equipment and other departments, and promptly concentrated efforts to solve key problems in the project leadership. For example, in the river-blocking dam project, which is currently under intense construction, after the dam foundation was excavated, there was excessive underground seepage, making it difficult to pour concrete. Many people were at a loss. Yuan Zijun, Deputy Director of the Engineering Bureau, and Chen Gengyi, Director of the Office, both went deep into the site, mobilized the broad masses of staff and workers to actively find solutions, and persisted for twenty-nine days, finally completing the pouring of the eight-and-a-half-meter-high concrete cut-off wall. The working enthusiasm of the leading cadres greatly encouraged the broad masses of staff and workers. Now, a responsibility system has been established in all sections, offices and construction units under the leadership of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau. The original "small warehouses" and "small finance departments" of each construction unit have been uniformly placed under the leadership of the Engineering Bureau, correcting the phenomenon of ineffective command in the past, so that engineers can free themselves from administrative affairs and concentrate their energy on leading and organizing construction. The safety work at the construction site has also been strengthened with concrete leadership. Starting from March 25th, a safety and accident-free month has been launched at the construction site, striving to completely eliminate casualties.

Currently, the broad masses of staff and workers participating in the construction of the Guanting Reservoir have an unprecedentedly high level of enthusiasm for labor. The mechanics team and electricians team under the Machine and Electrical Section have launched a red flag competition.

    永定河官厅水库广大员工积极迎接施工
    【新华社七日讯】永定河官厅水库工地上的广大员工，参加了反官僚主义运动后，劳动积极性大大提高。现在官厅水库工程领导机构已作调整，河北省通县、保定两专区二万多民工已陆续到达工地，不日就要大规模地施工。
    今年春天，官厅水库工地上展开了反官僚主义运动，广大员工揭露了工程上的拖延浪费等严重事件后，官厅水库工程局便决心改进。三月中旬，中央人民政府水利部便调派该部办公厅副主任郝执斋任官厅水库工程局局长。中共河北省委会也派省委委员李子光来协助中共官厅水库党委会工作。中央人民政府水利部副部长李葆华在三月中旬又亲自到官厅水库工地深入检查。官厅水库工程局依据李葆华副部长的指示和广大员工的意见，首先在领导干部中作了明确分工，分别深入领导工务、政治、民工、运输器材等部门，遇到工程领导当中的关键性问题，及时集中力量加以解决。如最近在紧张施工的拦河坝工程，坝基开挖后，地下渗水过多，浇筑混凝土困难，许多人束手无策，工程局副局长袁子钧和办公室主任陈赓仪都深入现场，发动广大员工积极想办法，一直坚持了二十九天，终于完成了八公尺半高的混凝土隔水墙的浇灌工程。领导干部的工作热情，大大鼓舞了广大员工。现在，官厅水库工程局领导下的各科、各室和各个施工单位都建立起责任制。各施工单位原有的“小仓库”、“小财务”，都已统一归工程局领导，纠正了以往指挥不灵的现象，使工程师摆脱行政事务的纠缠，能集中精力领导和组织施工。工地的安全工作也加强了具体领导。三月二十五日起，工地上展开了安全无事故月，争取彻底消灭伤亡事故。
    现在，参加官厅水库施工的广大员工，劳动热情空前高涨。机电科所属机工队、电工队已展开红旗竞赛。
