Hebei Wuqiang County Gengjiazhuang Elementary School teachers Fu Shulai and Wang Like, in violation of the New Democratic education policy, divorced from reality, fantasized about organizing a so-called "collectivized school," creating a very bad influence among the masses.

Fu Shulai and Wang Like, after seeing the article "The Hungarian Juvenile Republic" in the eighth volume of "Elementary National Language," mistakenly understood "The Hungarian Juvenile Republic" as "children's collectivization." Therefore, after the start of the autumn semester in 1952, they came up with a unique idea to fantasize about organizing a so-called "collectivized school." Their plan: all students participating in the "collective elementary school" would bring three mu of land each to the school for cultivation, build new classrooms and student dormitories in the fields, and the students' living, learning, and all expenses would be provided by the school. Teachers and students would jointly participate in production, implementing a "three-eight system" (i.e., eight hours each for learning, production, and rest). They also wanted to ask the government to build houses, buy livestock, make new-style farm tools, dig wells, provide technical guidance, allocate start-up funds, and increase the number of teachers. In their view, organizing a "collectivized school" to take children away from their families, learning and producing at the same time, and living collectively, would not only "better cultivate children's collectivism and patriotism" but also "drive the masses of the whole village to organize." In their view, "the countryside is about to be collectivized." In their view, the "collectivized school" is well-suited to the current "path of mutual assistance and cooperation" in the countryside and is the "direction of social development." Based on these erroneous understandings, they began to promote, saying: "After the collectivized school is organized, with the strong help of the government, we will be able to eat well, live well, study well, and make rapid progress." "Wear the same uniform, wear the same hat, live a very happy life, and serve the motherland." They even insisted that "if we don't do this now, we will have to take this path in the future."

Sun Zhihe, the secretary of the Gengjiazhuang branch of the Chinese Communist Party, after hearing this erroneous propaganda, also blindly expressed his willingness to help. In mid-December of last year, Sun Zhihe talked to Zhang Guojie, the section chief of the Industry and Commerce Section of the County People's Government, about their plan to organize a "collectivized school," asking if it was feasible. This Section Chief Zhang, without thinking it over, said: "It is feasible, the higher-ups will definitely have no objection, I'm just afraid your strength won't be enough!" So Sun Zhihe also talked to Xu Linbo, the director of the County People's Procuratorate, who also thought it was "feasible." And said: "You organize it! But you have to put in some effort, relying solely on teachers is not enough." On January 10th of this year, Gao Rongchun, the cultural and educational assistant of the district, also said to Fu Shulai and Wang Like: "This is a direction of development." He also suggested that several farmers be called to the school to help with the work. Sun Zhihe, Fu Shulai, and Wang Like, after receiving these blind support, decided to go to the county on January 17th to ask for approval. But at the district office, they met Song Ziyu, the head of the County Culture and Education Section, who also did not conduct research, but blurted out: "This is a direction of development! If other countries can do it, we can do it too." He also said that he wanted to "ask the province for instructions" and asked them to "brew on it first." However, Song Ziyu did not ask the province for instructions, and this erroneous proposition was brewing among the masses in Gengjiazhuang. After three months of "propaganda and brewing," thirty-one students have already registered to enter the "collective elementary school" (including twelve boys and nineteen girls; among these thirty-one students, eleven are under ten years old, thirteen are between eleven and fifteen years old, and seven are between sixteen and eighteen years old). The two teachers also planned to take action at the start of school this spring and planned to exchange scattered plots of land with the masses to connect the land of this "collectivized school" into one piece.

The fantasy of organizing a "collectivized school" has caused ideological confusion among the masses and created a very bad influence. In the process of "propaganda and brewing," children argued with their parents every day for land: "Give me three mu of land, this is my share, and I won't need you to take care of me anymore. After I study, I will serve the motherland." This damaged the normal relationship between children and their families. An old woman in her sixties said painfully: "We two old people only have one daughter, who cries every day for land. Let her go, we are old anyway, useless, no one cares anymore!" Many students' parents think: "If we raise children, they won't take care of the elderly, so give them three mu of land and let them go!" In addition, the organization of the "collectivized school" also caused some farmers to worry about "eating from the same pot," blurring their understanding of the future development of society and making them afraid of future agricultural collectivization.

After this incident occurred, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee discovered it and immediately instructed the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the CPC to send people to Gengjiazhuang in coordination with the Wuqiang County Committee of the CPC to conduct inspections and corrections, so the organization of the "collectivized school" did not become a reality. On March 5, the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC issued a circular, pointing out that there are still serious chaotic phenomena in the school work in various parts of Hebei Province. The propaganda departments of party committees at all levels must strengthen the education of primary school teachers and cultural and educational cadres and strengthen their leadership. The circular also emphasized that if the situation where the propaganda departments of party committees at all levels do not manage schools and abandon leadership over school work is not quickly changed, it will bring greater losses to our education work.

    河北武强耿家庄小学教师幻想组织所谓“集体化学校”
    河北武强县耿家庄小学教师傅书来、王立科，违背新民主主义教育方针，脱离实际，幻想组织“集体化学校”，在群众中造成极坏影响。
    傅书来和王立科因为在“初级国语”第八册上见有“匈牙利的少年共和国”一文，错误地把“匈牙利的少年共和国”了解成“儿童集体化”，于是在一九五二年秋季开学后，独出心裁，幻想组织所谓“集体化学校”。他们计划：凡参加“集体小学”的学生，每人带三亩地归学校耕种，在野外新建课堂和学生宿舍，学生的生活、学习及一切费用都由学校供给，师生共同参加生产，实行“三八制”（即学习、生产、休息各八小时）。他们并想要求政府给盖房子、买牲口、制新式农具、打井、进行技术指导、拨给开办费用和增加教师等。在他们看来，组织“集体化学校”叫儿童们脱离家庭，
    一面学习，一面生产，过集体生活，不仅会“更好地培养儿童们的集体主义和爱国主义思想”，而且能
    “带动全村群众组织起来”。在他们看来，“农村就要集体化了”。在他们看来，“集体化学校”正适合当前农村中“互助合作的道路”，是“社会的发展方向”。根据这些错误的认识，他们便开始宣传说：“集体化学校组织起来以后，再得到政府的大力帮助，我们就能吃的好、住的好、学习好、进步快。”“穿一样的制服，戴一样的帽子，过非常幸福的生活，为祖国服务。”还硬说“现在不这样做，将来也得走这条路”。
    中共耿家庄支部书记孙志和在听了这种错误的宣传后，也盲目地表示愿意帮助。去年十二月中旬，孙志和向县人民政府工商科科长张国杰谈了他们要组织“集体化学校”的事，问行不行，这位张科长未加考虑，便说：“行是行，上级准没意见，就怕你们的力量达不到！”于是孙志和又向县人民检察署主任徐林波谈，徐主任也认为“行”。并说：“你们组织罢！但你得上点劲，光靠教员可不行。”今年一月十日，该区文教助理员高荣春又对傅书来、王立科讲：“这是个发展方向。”还提议叫几个农民到学校帮助干活。孙志和、傅书来、王立科在得到这些盲目的支持后，便决定在一月十七日到县里去请示批准。但在区公所遇到了县文教科长宋子玉，宋子玉也未进行研究，便信口开河地说：“这是个发展方向！别的国能行，咱们也能行。”他还说，要“向省里请示”，叫他们“先酝酿着”。可是宋子玉并没有向省里请示，这个错误的主张就在耿家庄群众当中酝酿起来了。经过三个月的“宣传酝酿”，已有三十一个学生登记入“集体小学”（其中男生十二人、女生十九人，在这三十一个学生当中，十岁以下的十一人，十一岁到十五岁的十三人，十六岁到十八岁的七人）。这两个教师还打算在今春开学时便行动起来，并计划把零星的土地和群众交换一下，把这“集体化学校”的土地连成一片。
    幻想组织“集体化学校”的事，在群众中引起了思想上的混乱，造成极坏的影响。在“宣传酝酿”过程中，儿童们每天和家长吵着要地：“你给我三亩地，这是我那一份，以后什么也不用你管了。我念了书就去为祖国服务。”这样就损害了儿童和家庭的正常关系。一个六十多岁的老大娘痛心地说：“我们老俩口子，只有一个女儿，天天哭着要地。去罢，反正我们也老了，没用了，没人管啦！”很多学生家长则认为：“把孩子养大了也不会管老人的，给他们三亩地叫他们去罢！”另外，组织“集体化学校”的事情，也使某些农民产生了“怕吃大锅饭”的顾虑，使他们模糊了对社会发展前途的认识，对将来的农业集体化也害怕起来。
    这件事情发生后，经中共中央华北局宣传部发觉，当即指示中共石家庄地委派人协同中共武强县委到耿家庄进行检查纠正，所以组织“集体化学校”的事才没有成为事实。三月五日，中共河北省委宣传部发出通报，指出：河北省各地学校工作中还存有严重的混乱现象，各级党委宣传部必须加强对小学教师和文教干部的教育，加强对他们的领导。通报并着重指出：各级党委宣传部不管学校、放弃对学校工作领导的状况如不迅速转变，必将给我们的教育工作带来更大损失。
