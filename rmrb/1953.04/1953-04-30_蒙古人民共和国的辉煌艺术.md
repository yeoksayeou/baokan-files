The performances of the Mongolian People's Republic Art Troupe in Beijing left a deep and unforgettable impression on the Chinese audience. This was not only because the outstanding Mongolian People's Artists’ diverse artistic forms and excellent performances vividly reflected the happy and joyful lives of the Mongolian people in building a socialist country; nor was it only because the warm cheers from the venue expressed the brotherly and close friendship between China and Mongolia, but also because the talented and creative artistic practice of the Mongolian People's Artists provided many beneficial experiences for our Chinese literary and art workers, which are worth learning from.

This performance included 21 programs such as solo singing, chorus, folk instrumental and orchestral ensemble, solo, dance, ballet, opera, soft dance, fitness performance and acrobatics. From the wonderful performances of these 127 outstanding Mongolian People's Artists, it can be seen that their forms are so rich and their styles are so gorgeous and colorful, possessing national character and fresh life atmosphere, which fully demonstrates that the Mongolian people have made great achievements in promoting national art and learning from the advanced art experience of the Soviet Union since the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution. Comrade Oyun, the head of the Mongolian Art Troupe, told us: "Only when ordinary herders and laborers become masters of their own destiny can our culture and art have broad development and a bright future." This sentence is completely proven by the facts before us. After the victory of the revolution, the development of Mongolian people's art inherited the profound Mongolian national art tradition. On this basis, with the help of the advanced art experience of the Soviet Union and the long-term practice of artists for more than 30 years, it has gained new blood and has more abundant vitality.

Among them, the matouqin solo by meritorious actor Jimi Yan is a remarkable example. The matouqin is a folk instrument of the Mongolian nation with mythical and poetic charm. For thousands of years, its unique lyrical tone has softly resonated throughout the Mongolian grasslands. Because this instrument has always been loved by the Mongolian people, it has received attention and has greatly developed after the revolution. Mongolian People's Artists, based on the experience of the Soviet Union in reforming national musical instruments, not only first reformed the musical instrument itself, but also enriched and developed it in terms of composition and performance. Composers composed for it, and performers boldly used the performance techniques of Soviet stringed instruments to improve their bowing and fingering, so that the performance of the matouqin has reached a higher level. The "Cheers," performed by Jimi Yan this time, is a concentrated expression of these three aspects of reform. Bo. Damdingsuren's composition is full of folk melodies; and Jimi Yan's skillful bowing and accurate fingering have enabled the improved matouqin to exert its higher performance. The timbre of the improved matouqin is still so soft, but the volume is so grand. Whether it is playing national tunes or the melodies of other nations, it shows the temperament of the people on the deep and vast grassland. The reform experience of the matouqin is worth studying carefully.

Composers have also made great achievements in exploring and absorbing folk tunes to enrich their own creations. Many ancient folk songs have been made more complete and touching after being sorted out and processed by composers and singers. For example, the folk songs "Duman," "Gangdimot," and Chakqin folk song "Zebra" vividly show the Mongolian people's pursuit of a better life and the unique style of the grassland. Mongolian composers have also successfully used the Mongolian national musical language in their own creations, singing the happiness of the socialist motherland and fraternal countries from various angles. This time, composer Daoyud Dao Rijji's two songs praising the motherland and composer Fakaiman and composer Daoerji's two songs praising China and Sino-Mongolian friendship are full of Mongolian national style, and it is difficult to distinguish which one is a folk song and which one is a creation. It can be seen that the folk song factors have been fully used and absorbed in the created songs, and they are successfully combined.

Developing and inheriting the style of folk art traditions, vocalists have also done a lot of work in this regard. The solo singing of meritorious actor Chaoge Jilema is a brilliant example. Her specialized vocal training has greatly developed her expressive methods while maintaining her national temperament. Her singing has a unique appeal. When she sings "My Beloved Motherland," the Mongolian people's love for the motherland is stirring in her heart; and when she sings "People of the world unite tightly," we are surprised that she accurately sang the feelings of the Chinese people, which caused the audience to cheer for her again and again!

Zhagdasleng's female solo also has deep Mongolian national feelings. The three Mongolian songs she sang made people feel admiration and yearning for the happy life of the Mongolian People's Republic. Her singing method is purely based on the national singing method, and the transition of the vocal range is so natural, and the volume always maintains the same thickness. Another soloist, Ceebuge Mide's folk song solo also has the same natural and kind national temperament and rich artistic image.

From the performance of the three national collective dances in this performance, we can also see that they have strongly retained the style of the original national dance, and boldly and correctly absorbed the technology of Soviet classical dance to enrich their expressive methods. From the footwork of the "Duerbide Folk Dance" and the "Mongolian Dance," it can be seen that the actors have received strict classical dance training, and the style of the entire dance is national. This mature experience is of great enlightenment to us.

The development of national dance and the reform of music accompaniment also occupy a large position. We cannot ignore the role of the Mongolian Art Troupe's bold use of orchestras to accompany national dances. Bo. The orchestral accompaniment music composed by Damdingsuren for the "Mongolian Dance" speaks the same language as the dance, with harmonious and coordinated tones, effectively controlling the performance of the orchestra to serve and enrich the emotions of the dance. He provided the possibility of developing and reforming the accompaniment music of national dance, adjusting and using the orchestra to express a certain national style for the accompaniment of national dance.

From these performances, we fully realize that the style of Mongolian national art is constantly moving forward. Many of these brilliant national arts are developed on the basis of improved folk art, and socialist content is the basic key to the continued development and enrichment of national forms.

In addition, we can further appreciate that the art of the Mongolian People's Republic, due to its continuous influence from the surrounding new life—socialist reality—and the close and friendly exchanges between the national cultures of its neighboring countries, especially the socialist culture of the Soviet Union, has enabled Mongolian art to not only greatly develop folk art to enrich the field of national art, but also boldly absorb some new art forms to meet the diverse needs of the masses' lives. For example, the use of modern orchestras and the establishment of new operas have all been developed after the revolution under the direct influence of the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and classical art from all over the world. They have also become an important part of Mongolian people's art.

The acrobatics performance of the Mongolian National Grand Circus, although only eleven or twelve years old, has also achieved great success. Their wonderful performances, such as Shen Dayouxi's "Climbing the Ladder," the actresses Ceren Daolima, Majik Surong and Minjin's "Holding the Ladder," especially Majik Surong's soft dance, outstandingly show the Mongolian people's strong, brave and witty character. Seeing these performances with highly complex skills and at the same time with the characteristics of the Mongolian nation can help us further understand and love this simple, strong and witty nation.

The wonderful performances of the Mongolian People's Republic Art Troupe provide extremely valuable experience and achievements in boldly learning from the advanced artistic experience of Soviet socialist realism to develop their own national art. The Mongolian People's Artists are remembering the teachings of their leader Choibalsan: "All the achievements of the Soviet Union in art are our example. We must constantly learn from the Soviet Union!" and are following this path forward. Learning from their experience will be very beneficial to the development of our great motherland's national art.

    蒙古人民共和国的辉煌艺术
    叶林
    蒙古人民共和国艺术团在北京的演出给了中国观众以深刻难忘的印象。这不但是因为杰出的蒙古人民艺术家们的多种多样艺术形式的卓越表演，显明地反映了蒙古人民在建设社会主义国家中的幸福愉快的生活；也不但是由于从会场上热烈的欢呼声表现了中蒙两国兄弟般的亲密友谊，而且，由于蒙古人民艺术家的天才的创造性的艺术实践，对我们中国的文艺工作者来说，还提供了许多有益的经验，值得我们学习。
    这次演出包括了独唱、合唱，民间器乐和管弦乐合奏、独奏，舞蹈，舞剧，歌剧，柔软舞，健身表演和杂技等二十一个节目。从这一百二十七位杰出的蒙古人民艺术家的精彩表演中，可以看出，它们在形式上是如此丰富，在风格上又是如此瑰丽多采，具有民族的性格与新鲜的生活气息，充分地说明了蒙古人民革命胜利以后，在发扬民族艺术和学习苏联先进艺术经验方面是有着巨大的成就的。蒙古艺术团团长奥云同志告诉我们：“只有在普通的牧民与劳动者成了自己命运的主人以后，我国的文化与艺术才有了广阔发展与繁荣的前途。”这句话是完全被摆在面前的事实所证明了。革命胜利以后，蒙古人民艺术的发展，是继承了有着深厚的蒙古民族艺术传统的，在这样的基础上，由于苏联先进艺术经验的帮助与艺术家们三十多年来的长期实践，它获得了新的血液，具有更充沛的生命力。
    其中功勋演员吉木彦的马头琴独奏就是一个显著的例子。马头琴是蒙古民族富有神话色彩的、诗一般迷人的民间乐器，千百年来，它底特有的抒情的音色柔和地响遍了蒙古草原。这个乐器因为一贯为蒙古人民所喜爱，所以在革命后便首先受到了重视，有着很大的发展。蒙古人民艺术家们根据苏联改革民族乐器的经验，不仅首先从乐器本身进行改革，而且也从作曲与演奏上加以丰富和发展。作曲家们为它作曲，演奏家们大胆地运用了苏联弦乐器的演奏技巧，改进他们的弓法和指法，使马头琴的演奏具有了更高的水平。这次吉木彦所演奏的“干杯”，是这三方面改革的集中表现。博·达木丁苏伦的作曲充满了民间情调；而吉木彦用弓的技巧与指法的准确，更使已经改良过的马头琴发挥了更高度的性能。改良过的马头琴音色依然是那样地柔和而音量却又那样地宽宏，无论是演奏民族的曲调还是其他民族的旋律，都表现了深沉而广阔的草原上的人民的气质。马头琴的改革经验，是值得我们细心研究的。
    作曲家们在发掘与吸收民间曲调以丰富自己创作的工作上，也有着很大的成绩。许多古老的民歌经过作曲家与演唱家的整理和加工，显得更完整、更感人了，像民歌“杜曼”、“冈迪莫特”与查克琴民歌“斑马”，都非常生动地显示了蒙古人民追求美好生活的思想与草原的特有风格。蒙古作曲家们在自己的创作上，也成功地运用了蒙古民族的音乐语言，从各个角度上来歌唱社会主义的祖国与兄弟国家的幸福。这次演出的作曲家道尤德道日吉的两首歌颂祖国的歌曲和作曲家法开耳曼、作曲家道尔基的两首歌颂中国和中蒙友谊的歌曲，都洋溢着蒙古民族的风格，很难令人区别出那一首是民歌，那一首是创作。可见创作歌曲中已充分地运用和吸收了民歌的因素，它们是成功地结合了。
    发展和继承民间艺术传统的风格，声乐家们在这方面也做了许多工作。功勋演员朝格吉勒玛的独唱就是其中的一个光辉的例子。她的专门的声乐训练大大地发展了她的表现方法而同时又保持了她的民族气质。她的歌唱有着一种特有的感染力，当她唱着“我的可爱的祖国”时，蒙古人民热爱祖国的情绪在她心胸激荡着；而在她歌唱“全世界人民团结紧”的时候，我们却又惊奇于她是那样准确地唱出了中国人民的感情，以至引起了听众为她再三欢呼！
    札格达斯楞的女声独唱也有着深厚的蒙古民族感情，她唱的三首蒙古歌曲使人产生了对蒙古人民共和国幸福生活的崇慕与向往之情。她的唱法纯粹是在民族的基础上提高了的唱法，声区的转换是那样地自然，而音量则始终保持着一样的厚度。另一个独唱家策布格米德的民歌独唱，也有着同样自然而亲切的民族气质与丰富的艺术形象。
    从这次演出的三个民族集体舞蹈的表演中，我们也同样看出它们既是强烈地保留了原有民族舞蹈的风格，又那样大胆而正确地吸收了苏联古典舞的技术来丰富了自己的表现方法。从“都尔别德民间舞蹈”与“蒙古舞”的步法中，可以看出演员们都受过严格的古典舞的训练，而整个舞蹈的风格则是民族的。这种成熟的经验对我们说来，是有着很大的启发意义的。
    民族舞蹈的发展，音乐伴奏方面的改革也占有很大的位置。我们不能忽视蒙古艺术团大胆地运用管弦乐队来伴奏民族舞蹈方面的作用。博·达木丁苏伦为“蒙古舞”所编的乐队伴奏音乐，它和舞蹈说着同一的语言，格调合拍而调和，有效地控制管弦乐队的性能来服役并丰富了舞蹈的情绪。他提供了发展并改革民族舞蹈的伴奏音乐，调整与运用管弦乐队，使它表现一定的民族风格为民族舞蹈伴奏的可能性。
    从这些演出中，我们充分地认识了蒙古民族艺术的风格是在不断地向前发展，这些光辉的民族艺术有许多都是在提高了的民间艺术的基础上发展起来的，而社会主义的内容，则是使民族形式继续发展和丰富的基本关键。
    此外，我们还可以进一步地体会到蒙古人民共和国的艺术，由于它受到周围新的生活——社会主义现实的不断影响，与各邻邦民族文化特别是苏联社会主义文化之间亲密的友好的交流，使蒙古艺术除了大量发展民间艺术以丰富民族艺术的领域以外，还大胆地吸收了一些新的艺术形式，以满足群众生活多方面的需要。如现代化管弦乐队的使用与新歌剧的建立等，都是革命以后直接受苏联、各人民民主国家和世界各国古典艺术的影响而发展起来的。它们也已成为蒙古人民艺术中重要的组成部分。
    蒙古国家大马戏团的杂技表演，虽然只有十一、二年的历史，但同样地有极大的成就。他们的精彩表演，如沈达由希表演的“登梯”，女演员策仁道利玛，马吉克素荣和敏金的“顶梯”，特别是马吉克素荣的柔软舞，都杰出地显示了蒙古人民强壮、勇敢、机智的性格。看了这些具有高度复杂技巧而又同时具有蒙古民族性格特质的演出，可以帮助我们进一步理解并热爱这个朴素、强壮而又机智的民族。
    蒙古人民共和国艺术团的精彩演出，在大胆学习苏联社会主义现实主义的先进艺术经验以发展自己民族艺术方面，提供了极为可贵的经验与成绩，蒙古人民艺术家们正记取着自己领袖乔巴山的教导：“苏联在艺术上的一切成就都是我们的榜样。我们要不断地向苏联学习！”并遵循着这样的道路向前迈进。学习他们的经验，对发展我们伟大祖国的民族艺术，将是非常有益的。
