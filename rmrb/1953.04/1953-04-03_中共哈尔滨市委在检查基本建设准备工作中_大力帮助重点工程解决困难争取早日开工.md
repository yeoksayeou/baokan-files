    The CCP Harbin Municipal Committee Inspects Basic Construction Preparations, Vigorously Helping Key Projects Solve Difficulties to Strive for Early Commencement
    In its in-depth inspection of basic construction preparations, the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee gave play to the proactive and initiative spirit of the local Party committee, concentrating efforts to help key national projects solve specific difficulties, striving to quickly complete preparatory work, and aiming for early commencement.
    According to the recent inspection in Harbin, although various basic construction units in the city have done a lot of preparatory work, there are still serious problems. Projects likely to commence in the first phase (April to June) only account for slightly more than 40% of all projects, with the majority of projects commencing successively after June. Furthermore, the most serious problems are mainly in key projects. For example, one electrical engineering factory, due to the inability to submit design drawings on schedule, seriously affected material preparation work. The factory's large-scale buildings require more than 3,000 tons of steel, but only 275 tons are currently available, less than one-tenth. It needs 180 tons of rivets, but none have been stockpiled. The steel frame project was originally scheduled to commence on March 10th, and the civil engineering project on April 1st, but both cannot be realized now.
    The design drawings for one machinery factory have not yet arrived, and the main steel specifications are unknown, making it impossible to start preparations. In addition, there is a general shortage of red bricks in Harbin, which has become a serious problem. This year, all units plan to increase the proportion of factory and mechanized construction, but most of the processing plants have not yet been established, and very few construction machinery and equipment have arrived.
    Based on this situation, it is now urgent to concentrate efforts to solve the problems of key projects so that key projects related to the destiny of national construction can be affected as little as possible. To this end, the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee clearly stated: It is necessary to criticize the phenomenon of leaders at all levels neglecting key projects, and it must be recognized that serving basic construction means first and foremost serving key projects. Therefore, it was decided that the city's leading cadres would personally take charge of key projects individually. The city will also conduct a project ranking to concentrate manpower and material resources to first support key projects. Wang Hefeng, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Guo Linjun, Deputy Mayor, have successively held professional meetings to clarify the situation, define responsibilities, and make decisions, so that the problems of some projects have been preliminarily resolved quickly. Preparations are now underway to continue holding such professional meetings to help key projects solve some difficulties in a more in-depth and specific way.
    At the same time, to give play to the initiative and proactive spirit of various units, it is also necessary to eliminate ideological obstacles for leading cadres in various units. The main ideological obstacles currently existing are: varying degrees of blind optimism, complacency, believing that there are too many difficulties in basic construction and that all failures are due to "objective reasons," insufficient awareness of the serious situation, and a lack of the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties. For example, the leading cadres of the Second Engineering Company of the Electrical Engineering Bureau, when someone said, "The spring came early this year, and preparations should be stepped up," he said, "This is a psychological effect." When someone said, "Your financial management is very chaotic," he said, "To complete the construction task, we have to break the financial system." In fact, the company's preparatory work was done very poorly. For example, winter technical education was done very badly, and not a single specialized worker was trained. There is currently a shortage of 300 specialized workers, and there is not a single specialized worker construction worker. Some purchase orders were signed too carelessly, with the risk of failing. For example, the keystones ordered in a certain county did not take into account the other party's transportation capacity and actual situation. To transport the stones, one has to cross three rivers. After the rivers thaw, it will be impossible to transport them. Even without the rivers, it would be impossible to mobilize the entire county's population and vehicles to deliver them to the station on time. The leadership did not pay attention when this situation was discovered. In response to this situation, the CCP Harbin Municipal Committee has adopted various methods, such as conducting individual talks to break through thoughts, holding meetings to clarify right and wrong, and conducting public criticisms, to urge and help various units to seize the time to do a good job in preparation.
    The Municipal Party Committee has also taken effective measures to address the issue of local material supply. Currently, engineering units have stockpiled about 80% of the materials supplied locally, such as stones, sand, river stones, and lime. The difficult issue is red bricks, which are estimated to be one-third short for the whole year (about 100 million bricks), which has the greatest impact on the first phase of the project. The city has held professional meetings to strengthen the leadership of brick kilns, equip brick kilns with cadres, and the Municipal Party Committee has also organized joint working groups to help stationed in factories. It has been decided to start work one month in advance, and organize technical training classes to learn the method of mechanized brick making, study and promote the advanced Soviet method of rapid firing, and try to accelerate the kiln turnover rate, to partially solve the problem of insufficient red bricks by increasing the output and quality of bricks.
    Regarding the solution of the idleness problem, due to the late start of many projects and the blindness in the work of fixed workers, there are too many fixed workers (accounting for two-thirds of all workers). In the first phase of the project, except for temporary workers, 10,000 fixed workers will be idle. It has now been decided that the Municipal Labor Bureau will uniformly allocate and balance labor based on project tasks and construction time. A meeting is currently being held to study the plan.
    In addition, efforts are being made to solve the transportation problem. For some issues that must be resolved by higher-level leaders, such as the supply of steel and wood, and design and technical strength issues, the units should promptly make suggestions to the higher levels. The Municipal Party Committee has submitted a special report on the preparation of the city's three key projects.
    While strengthening preparatory work, in order to prevent the bias of hasty commencement and serious confusion and poor quality caused by hasty commencement, the Municipal Party Committee specially proposes: 1. Before entering the construction site, we must formulate a construction plan, mobilize the masses to discuss it, and sign a contact contract to prevent the serious idleness caused by the lack of a plan after commencement. 2. We must pay attention to quality, especially in the early stages of commencement, we must lay a good foundation, and we must not be negligent, otherwise it will cause serious consequences. 3. Before and after commencement, we must pay attention to the workers' welfare and security issues, and conduct key inspections. 4. All units that cannot start work at present must continue to carry out technical education to improve the technical level of workers.

    中共哈尔滨市委在检查基本建设准备工作中
    大力帮助重点工程解决困难争取早日开工
    中共哈尔滨市委在深入检查基本建设准备工作中，发挥了地方党委的积极主动精神，集中力量帮助国家重点工程解决具体困难，设法迅速完成准备工作，争取早日开工。
    从哈尔滨市最近检查情况来看，该市各基本建设单位虽作了不少准备工作，但仍存在着严重问题。第一期（四月到六月）可能开工的工程仅占全部工程的百分之四十多，大部工程要在六月后陆续开工。而且问题严重的主要是重点工程，如一座电工工厂，由于设计图纸不能按期提出，严重影响材料准备工作。该厂大型厂房需要钢材三千多吨，现在只有二百七十五吨，不到十分之一，需要一百八十吨铆钉，一点也未储备。原准备钢架工程三月十日开工，土木工程四月一日开工，现均无法实现。
    一座机械厂设计图纸至今未到，主要钢料规格不明，无法着手准备。此外，哈尔滨市红砖普遍缺少，已成严重问题。今年各单位工厂化和机械化施工的
    比重都准备增大，但目前加工厂还大部没有建立，施工机械设备到货很少。
    根据这一情况，目前急需集中力量解决重点工程问题，才能使关系国家建设命运的重点工程尽可能的少受影响。为此，中共哈尔滨市委明确提出：必须批判各级领导忽视重点工程的现象，一定要认识为基本建设服务，首先要为重点工程服务，因此决定市的领导干部亲自分头具体掌握重点工程。并在全市进行工程排队，以便集中人力、物力首先支援重点工程。市委副书记王鹤峰和副市长郭林军，连续召开专业会议，弄清情况、明确责任、作出决定，使部分工程的问题迅速得到初步解决。现正准备继续召开这样的专业会议，以深入具体帮助重点工程解决部分困难。
    同时，为要发挥各单位的主动积极精神，还要扫除各单位领导干部思想障碍。目前存在的主要思想障碍是：不同程度的盲目乐观、骄傲自满的情绪，认为基本建设困难太多，做不好全是“客观原因”，对目前存在的严重情况认识不足，缺乏主动克服困难的精神。如担负电工局第二工程公司的领导干部，人家说：“今年开春早，准备工作要抓紧。”他说：“这是心理作用。”人家说：“你的财务管理很混乱。”他说：“要完成施工任务，那就得破坏财政制度。”事实上该公司的准备工作做得很差，如冬训技术教育搞得很糟，特种工人一个都没有训练，现尚缺三百多特种工人，特种工的施工员一个也没有。有些订货合同订得太马虎，有落空的危险。如在某县订妥的基石，没有考虑对方的运输能力与实际情况，运石时要过三道河，开河后无法搬运；即使没有河，要动员全县人口和车马也无法按时送至车站。发现了这种情况也未引起领导上的注意。针对这种情况，中共哈尔滨市委已采取各种方式，如进行个别谈话打通思想，召开会议弄清是非，以及进行大会批评等，从而督促帮助各单位抓紧做好准备工作。
    对地方材料供应问题，市委也采取了有效措施。目前由地方供应的材料，如石头、砂子、河流石、石灰，工程单位都已储备了百分之八十左右；困难的是红砖问题，估计全年尚缺三分之一（约一亿多块），对第一期工程影响最大。该市已召开专业会议，加强砖窑领导，配备砖窑干部，市委也组织了联合工作组驻厂帮助，决定提前一个月开工，同时组织技术训练班学习机械制砖法，研究推广苏联稀码快烧先进经验，设法加速窑的运转率，从提高砖的产量、质量来部分解决红砖不足的问题。
    关于解决窝工问题，由于许多工程开工很晚，以及在固定工人工作上的盲目性，固定工人过多（占全部工人的三分之二），在第一期工程中除临时工外将有一万固定工人窝工。现已决定根据工程任务与施工时间，由市劳动局统一调配，平衡劳动力，现正在召开会议研究方案。
    此外，正着手解决运输问题。有些必须上级领导解决的，如钢材与木材的供应，设计与技术力量问题等，要各单位及时向上级提出建议。市委已将该市三个重点工程的准备情况作了专题报告。
    与加强准备工作的同时，为防止各单位因仓促开工而造成严重混乱与质量低劣的偏向，市委特提出：一、在进入工地前，一定要制订施工计划，发动群众讨论，并订立联系合同，以防止开工后因缺乏计划而产生的严重窝工现象。二、一定要重视质量，特别开工初期要打好地基，不能稍有疏忽，不然就要造成严重后果。三、开工前后要注意工人生活福利与保安问题，要有重点进行检查。四、凡目前尚不能开工的单位，必须继续进行技术教育，提高工人技术水平。
