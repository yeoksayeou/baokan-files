    I Care About the Workers' Health
    Wang Baoshu, Physician at the Yunnan Textile Factory Health Clinic
    I was transferred to the Yunnan Textile Factory as a doctor in May 1951. When the leadership wanted me to come here, I had many concerns. I always felt that factory health work was difficult and I was afraid of not doing it well. Many comrades helped me and encouraged me, but they did not completely dispel my concerns. So I came to the factory with a "give it a try" attitude. In the beginning, I just sat in the health clinic waiting for patients, without considering how to do a good job.

    In the past two years, the new environment and new things have influenced and educated me, changing my incorrect understanding of factory health work. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, a production competition campaign was launched throughout the factory. The workers' enthusiasm for labor deeply moved me. I realized the greatness of the working class.

    During the production competition campaign, due to poor health care work and other reasons, the number of workers getting sick gradually increased. As soon as the clinic opened, many worker comrades came to the clinic to see a doctor. At that time, the health clinic had only five doctors, and we were simply overwhelmed. Everyone felt distressed about this. I was even more anxious: with so many patients, the health clinic should bear the greatest responsibility, because we had not done a good job in daily preventive work.

    In order to ensure the health of the workers and consolidate the achievements of the labor competition, the comrades in the health clinic had an in-depth discussion and decided to change the past working methods, go deep into the workshops, and study the causes of worker illnesses.

    We first discovered that poor sleep among worker comrades was the basic cause of headaches. Because workers on the night shift sleep during the day, but their dormitories are bright, making it difficult to fall asleep. As a result, workers often feel sleep-deprived, dizzy, and have headaches. Secondly, we also found that the temperature in the workshop and the outside temperature varied greatly, and workers often went in and out wearing thin clothes, so workers often suffered from colds, chronic rhinitis, and chronic bronchitis. In addition, we also found the reason for the increase in gynecological infectious diseases, mainly because female workers did not pay attention to public hygiene.

    The causes of some diseases were found, but immediately improving dormitory hygiene and lowering the temperature in the workshop could not be done overnight, because it required a large amount of funding. What to do? It is currently impossible for the factory to spend a lot of money on worker health work, so we can only solve this problem with revolutionary methods. We suggested that the factory leadership hang black curtains on the windows of the dormitories to make the light in the room darker, making it easier for workers to fall asleep; changing rooms were set up in the workshop to allow workers to wear more clothes when leaving the workshop, in order to avoid frequent colds. At the same time, our five doctors took turns using their spare time to give workers lectures on basic health knowledge, telling them how to prevent diseases and why they should pay attention to public and personal hygiene.

    As a result, the daily common diseases have decreased; but how to prevent and treat appendicitis is still a big problem in our factory. I remember that in 1951, there were particularly many workers in the factory suffering from appendicitis, almost more than ten people developing appendicitis every month, and as many as thirty people at most. And the surgical treatment of appendicitis is relatively troublesome, especially in the factory health clinic with relatively simple equipment, the doctors feel even more difficult. To solve this difficult problem, we can only try to prevent the occurrence of appendicitis. So I began to pay attention to the lives of the workers and conduct investigations and research on the patients. Finally, I discovered two main causes of appendicitis: one reason was that female workers did not like to drink water, so the stool formed constipation; the other reason was that most people's intestines had parasitic roundworms. So I made a suggestion to the leadership, calling on workers to drink more boiled water and use "Quisqualis indica" to expel roundworms. After these two methods were implemented, significant results were achieved. Few patients with appendicitis were found in the factory in 1952.

    In addition to carefully studying the causes of various diseases and carrying out prevention and treatment, we also care about the lives of patients at all times and try our best to reduce their suffering. For example, after some workers get sick, they are always concerned about production and cannot rest in peace. I patiently comforted them and persuaded them, making them feel as warm in the ward as they were at home. We also regularly check on people with chronic diseases, and always understand their ideological situation and difficulties, and help them eliminate doubts and overcome difficulties. For example, when chronic patients are worried about their illness, we explain to them that as long as they rest quietly, there is hope for recovery from general chronic diseases. When some patients cannot rest in peace because of heavy family financial burdens, we promptly report the situation to the trade union, and the trade union finds ways to solve their difficulties.

    We are very careful in the use of medicines. For example, many female workers in the Second Workshop suffer from neurasthenia and irregular menstruation, so we try to treat them with egg yolk injection. But for us, this is a new attempt. Before promoting this treatment, we conducted several experiments. The experimental results were very good, and no bad reactions were found.

    Experience has proved that to do a good job in factory health work, doctors must not adopt the method of sitting in the health clinic and waiting for patients, but must care about the daily lives of the workers and implement the policy of "prevention first."

### 我关心着工人的健康

    我关心着工人的健康
    云南纺织厂卫生室医师  王宝书
    我是在一九五一年五月间调到云南纺织厂当医生的。当领导方面要我到这里来的时候，我有很多的顾虑，我总觉得工厂卫生工作难搞，怕搞不好。许多同志帮助我、鼓励我，但并没有完全解除我的顾虑。于是我抱着“试一试”的态度到工厂里来了。开始，我只是坐在卫生室里等病人，并没有考虑到如何做好工作。
    二年来，新的环境、新的事物影响和教育了我，使我改变了对工厂卫生工作的不正确的认识。在抗美援朝运动中，全厂开展了生产竞赛运动。工人的劳动热情深深地感动了我。我体会到了工人阶级的伟大。
    在生产竞赛运动中，由于卫生保健工作作得不好以及其他原因，工人生病的人数渐渐增加起来了。一到开诊时间，就有很多工人同志来门诊部看病。当时，卫生室只有五个医生，简直忙不过来。大家都为此感到苦恼。我心里更是着急：病人这么多，卫生室应该负最大的责任，因为我们没有做好日常的预防工作。
    为了保证工人的健康，巩固劳动竞赛的成绩，卫生室的几位同志深入地进行了讨论，决定改变过去的工作方法，深入车间，去研究工人发生疾病的原因。
    我们首先发现了工人同志睡眠不好是发生头痛病的基本原因。因为夜班的工人都在白天睡觉，可是他们的宿舍是透亮的，往往很难睡熟。这样，工人就时常感到睡眠不足，头昏脑胀。其次，我们又发现车间的温度和室外的气温悬殊，而工人又时常穿着薄薄的衣服进进出出，因此工人多患感冒、慢性鼻炎和慢性气管炎。此外，我们又发现了妇科传染病增加的原因，主要是女工不注意公共卫生。
    某些疾病的原因是找到了，但要立即改善宿舍卫生、降低车间内的温度却不是一下就能办到的，因为这需要很大一笔经费。怎么办呢？要工厂里拿出很多的钱来做工人卫生工作，目前是不可能的，只能用革命的办法来解决这问题。我们便建议工厂领导方面在宿舍的窗子上挂上黑色窗帘，使室内的光线变得暗一些，这样工人也就容易睡熟了；车间内设更衣室，让工人在离开车间时多穿一些衣服，免得经常发生感冒。同时，我们五个医生轮流利用业余时间给工人讲日常卫生常识，告诉他们怎样预防疾病，为什么要注意公共卫生和个人卫生。
    这样一来，日常的普通疾病是减少了；但是如何防治盲肠炎，在我们厂里还是一个很大的问题。记得在一九五一年那年，厂里患盲肠炎的工人特别多，几乎每个月有十多个人发生盲肠炎，最多时竟达到三十多个人。而盲肠炎的割治是比较麻烦的，尤其是在设备比较简陋的工厂卫生室，医生更是感到困难。要解决这个困难问题只有设法防止盲肠炎的发生。于是我又开始注意工人们的生活，并对病人进行调查研究，终于发现了引起盲肠炎的两个主要原因，一个原因是女工不喜欢喝水，因此大便形成秘结；另一个原因是多数人的肠子里有寄生蛔虫。于是我向领导方面提出建议，号召工人多喝开水，用“使君子”驱除蛔虫。这两个办法实行以后，收到了很显著的效果，一九五二年内厂里很少发现患盲肠炎的病人。
    我们除了细心研究各种疾病的发生原因，进行防治以外，还时时关心病人的生活，尽量设法减少病人的痛苦。例如有些工人病倒以后，心里总是牵挂着生产，不能安心养病。我便耐心地安慰他们，说服他们，使他们在病房里，就像在自己家里一样的温暖。对于有慢性病的人，我们也经常进行检查，并随时了解他们的思想情况和困难，帮助他们扫除疑虑，克服困难。例如当慢性病人对自己的病有忧虑时，我们就向他们解释，只要安静休养，一般慢性病总有痊愈的希望。有的病人因为家庭经济负担重，不能安心养病时，我们便及时向工会反映情况，由工会方面设法给他们解决困难问题。
    在使用药品方面，我们非常小心谨慎。例如二场有许多女工神经衰弱，月经不调，我们即设法用鸡蛋黄注射液给她们治疗。但对于我们说来，这是个新的尝试，在推广这一治疗法以前，我们曾进行了若干次的试验。试验结果极为良好，没有发现坏的反应。
    经验证明，要做好工厂卫生工作，医生决不能采取坐在卫生室里，等待病人的办法，必须关心工人的日常生活，贯彻“预防为主”的方针。
