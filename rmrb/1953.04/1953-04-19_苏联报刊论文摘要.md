Several Problems in the Work of the Soviet Writers' Union

Recently, Grossman's novel "For a Just Cause" has been criticized in Soviet newspapers. In his article "Several Problems in the Work of the Soviet Writers' Union," published in the "Literary Gazette" on March 28, Fadeyev criticized Grossman's novel "For a Just Cause," pointing out that Grossman distorted the image of the Soviet people in this novel, especially the image of the Soviet people during the defense of Stalingrad. Fadeyev pointed out that this novel neither showed the heroism of the Soviet army, nor the heroic labor of the Soviet working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals. At the same time, he pointed out that the ideological basis of Grossman's work is an anti-Marxist-Leninist "theory of cycles."

Fadeyev's article includes three parts: the first part reviews Grossman's novel "For a Just Cause," the second part discusses the errors of the editorial department of the "New World" magazine, and the third part talks about the struggle to strive for the high quality of Soviet literature and its ideological enemies. The third part is summarized as follows:

　　The 19th Congress of the Party gave us some wise instructions directly related to literary tasks.

　　The entire work of the 19th Congress of the Party, all its resolutions, are directly related to the work of writers. The new five-year plan is a great movement forward in our country's communist construction. The enthusiasm for communist construction is the enthusiasm of our Soviet writers. The five-year plan largely defines our themes, it points us to the direction in life to which we should pay major attention.

　　We have before us the task of creating excellent artistic works of our Soviet era. This requires us to conduct unremitting struggles to strive for the high ideological and artistic quality of Soviet literature, to educate literary activists to have the profound and all-encompassing worldview of our teachers Lenin and Stalin, to cultivate genuine skills and related work habits, to learn from classical writers, and to improve general knowledge. Our task is first and foremost a task of education. However, there can be no true education if we do not unfold unreserved criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. If we do not expose alien and anti-Leninist views in front of writers, and if we do not cultivate the habit of high vigilance among writers, then we cannot correctly educate writers.

　　A clear path has been opened up in front of Soviet literature. But in realizing our tasks, we will, as before, encounter stubborn resistance from our domestic and foreign enemies and ideological enemies.

　　In order to comply with the Party's clear instructions in the field of literature and to use these instructions for our own benefit, we should study clearly what methods our ideological enemies are using.

　　In recent years, we have ideologically defeated many anti-Leninist tendencies in literature, which have seriously damaged and can still damage the development of our literature.

　　We have crushed the anti-patriotic group of rootless and obsequious cosmopolitans. Our Party's newspapers and periodicals have taught us to correctly understand this tendency as an anti-patriotic tendency, and pointed out the connection between these people and Western cosmopolitan thinkers.

　　We have carried out and are carrying out a struggle against bourgeois nationalism. In our time, bourgeois nationalists are essentially little different from cosmopolitans, because nationalists and cosmopolitans are both servants of foreign capital and work for it, and bourgeois nationalists are only doing this under the banner of nationalism.

　　We have crushed the tendency of formalism in literature. The tendency of formalism is not harmless either. First, it is a characteristic of thinkers with the above tendencies. Second, in its essence and nature, this tendency of formalism is to castrate our ideology and the communist content of our literature under the guise of striving for "pure art" and striving for pure form.

　　In our time, the political harm of the formalist tendency is particularly evident in the "no conflict" theory in dramatic creation theory. In fact, how "harmless" does it seem at first glance! They say that the plots of previous dramatic creations were built on conflicts, while the form of Soviet dramatic creations will be without conflicts. The basis of this "theory" is that there was a class society at that time, but now it is a classless society. This even has a formalistic appearance of "innovation."

　　This completely hostile theory is, in fact, a reflection of the theory of "eliminating class struggle" in literature.

　　We also gave a very heavy blow to the tendency that was characterized by "New Rappism" at that time ("RAPP" is the abbreviation of "Russian Association of Proletarian Writers" - editor's note). Some of us still have this view, thinking that among all kinds of anti-Leninist tendencies, this "New Rappist" tendency is less dangerous than other tendencies hostile to the Leninist-Stalinist worldview. This is very absurd! This anti-Leninist subjectivism in literature is accompanied by unwillingness to learn, a nihilistic attitude of contempt for classical heritage, and the view that socialist realism itself can make a writer's work a work of high artistic quality. The most dangerous thing in this New Rappist tendency is its sectarianism, the opposition between party members and non-party members, replacing the task of educating writers with yelling and commanding, and opposing the method of critical attack to educational criticism.

　　"New Rappists" distorted Lenin's principle of literary party spirit. They believe that party spirit in literature can only be achieved by party members and communists, as if only party members can master the method of socialist realism.

　　This does not conform to the real situation in the literary world, and its purpose is to attack non-Party literary cadres and make them leave the Party.

　　The various colors of these tendencies, in our time, often sing the same tune, exchange methods, tirelessly "work" in the literary and artistic circles and at meetings, disguise themselves, flatter, and actually try to distort and slander the Party's correct instructions as much as possible.

　　Yes, we must not only justly and thoroughly expose the ideological shortcomings in our works, but also expose the artistic shortcomings. We must think of excellent Soviet writers, we must think of the artistic quality of communist literature that is unprecedented in history. For this reason, we must unfold criticism and self-criticism in our ranks, and will continue to unfold it, no matter how these or those writers complain.

　　But our criticism is different from the criticism of our enemies, it is just criticism, it points out both the achievements in the works and exposes its shortcomings. It should try to determine the benefits or harms a work brings to society, and if there are benefits, then point out what kind of benefits, and also point out what is hindering the work from becoming a more precious spiritual treasure of the people.

Improving the Cultural and Technical Level of Workers

The "Labor Daily" published an editorial on March 20, discussing that leaders and trade union organizations in enterprises should actively support workers' cultural learning, summarized as follows:

　　Raising the cultural and technical level of workers to the level of engineers and technicians is one of the most important tasks of communist construction.

　　The interests of communist construction, the further improvement and perfection of socialist production, all require us to tirelessly care about the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working people. In completing this important task, enterprise leaders and trade unions play a major role. It is they who should create all conditions so that people can combine their studies in schools, training classes, and technical schools well with their production work.

　　However, there are still short-sighted leaders who do not care about the improvement of workers' knowledge, and think that this is a secondary matter. In many enterprises, there are still a large number of students being eliminated in night schools. The reason for this phenomenon is that the necessary conditions have not been created for the effective learning of young people, that is, their production work drags them down during class time, or they are burdened with too many social activities.

　　Trade unions should regard the general learning and production technology learning of workers as the object of their constant attention. The responsibility of trade unions is to constantly supervise so that all students in youth worker schools, technical schools, advanced correspondence schools, and secondary technical schools obtain the conditions for smooth learning. What does it mean to create such smooth learning conditions? This first means that production work should not encroach on students' class time, that they can obtain the necessary textbooks, and that they should create an environment in the dormitory that facilitates the completion of homework.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联作家协会工作中的几个问题
    最近在苏联的报刊上对格罗斯曼的小说“拥护正义事业”展开了批评。法捷耶夫在三月二十八日的“文学”报上发表的以“苏联作家协会工作中的几个问题”为题的论文中，即批评了格罗斯曼的小说“拥护正义事业”，指出格罗斯曼在这部小说中歪曲了苏联人民的形象，特别是保卫斯大林格勒时代的苏联人民的形象。法捷耶夫指出这部小说既没有表现出苏联军队的英勇，也没有表现出苏联工人阶级、集体农民和知识分子的英雄劳动。同时还指出，格罗斯曼这部著作的思想基础，是一种反马克思列宁主义的“循环论”。
    法捷耶夫的这篇文章包括三部分：第一部分评格罗斯曼的小说“拥护正义事业”，第二部分论“新世界”杂志编辑部的错误，第三部分谈到争取苏联文学的高度质量的斗争及其思想上的敌人。现在把第三部分摘要如下：
    党的第十九次代表大会给予了我们一些直接有关于文学的任务的英明指示。
    党的第十九次代表大会的全部工作、它的一切决议，都和作家的工作有着直接的关系。新的五年计划，就是我国共产主义建设事业中一个前进的伟大运动。共产主义建设的热情，就是我们苏维埃作家的热情。五年计划在颇大程度上规定了我们的题材，它指给我们：我们应当把主要的注意转向生活的那一方向。
    在我们面前有一个创造我们苏维埃的优秀艺术作品的任务。这就要求我们进行不倦的斗争以争取苏维埃文学的高度思想艺术的质量，要求我们教育文学活动家具有我们导师列宁和斯大林的深刻的、包罗万象的世界观，培养真正的技巧和与此有关的劳动习惯、向古典作家学习和提高一般知识的水平。我们的任务，首先就是教育的任务。可是，如果不展开不顾情面的批评与自我批评，首先是自下而上的批评，那就不可能有真正的教育。如果不在文学家的面前揭露那些异己的、反列宁主义的观点，如果不使文学家养成高度警惕性的习惯，那也就不能正确地教育文学家。
    苏维埃文学的前面开辟了一条明豁的道路。但是在实现我们的任务的时候，我们也将会像从前一样遇到我们国内和国外的敌人和思想上的敌人的顽强抵抗。
    为了符合党在文学领域中的明确指示和为了自己的利益而运用这些指示，我们就应当研究清楚我们思想上的敌人采用着什么样的方法。
    近些年来，我们在思想上击溃了文学中许多反列宁主义的倾向，它们曾经而且现在还能使我们文学的发展遭受严重的损害。
    我们粉碎了孤寡无亲的卑躬屈节的世界主义者的反爱国主义的集团。我们党的报刊教导了我们把这种倾向正确地理解为反爱国主义的倾向，并指出了这些人与西方世界主义思想家的联系。
    我们进行了并且进行着反对资产阶级民族主义的斗争。在我们今天，资产阶级民族主义者本质上和世界主义者很少区别，因为民族主义者和世界主义者都是外国资本的佣仆并为其工作，资产阶级民族主义者只不过是在民族主义的旗帜下做这件事而已。
    我们粉碎了文学中的形式主义的倾向。形式主义的倾向也不是无害的。第一，它是有上述倾向的思想家的特征。第二，按其本质和本性来说，这种形式主义的倾向是要在争取“纯艺术”、争取纯形式的斗争旗帜掩饰下，来阉割我们的思想体系和我们文学的共产主义的内容。
    在我们今天，形式主义倾向的政治上的危害，特别明显地表现在戏剧创作理论中的“没有冲突”的理论方面。事实上，骤然看来是多么“无害”的理论呢！他们说，从前的戏剧创作的情节是建筑在冲突上面的，而苏维埃的戏剧创作，它的形式将是没有冲突的。这种“理论”的基础就是当时是阶级社会，而现在已是没有阶级的社会了。这甚至带有一种形式主义的“革新”外貌。
    这种完全敌对的理论，事实上就是文学中“消灭阶级斗争”理论的反映。
    我们对于当时曾以“新拉普派”说明其特点的那种倾向，也给与了十分沉重的打击（“拉普”是“俄国无产阶级作家协会”的简称——编者注）。我们之间有些人还是有这种看法的，他们认为好像在各种反列宁主义的倾向中，这种“新拉普派”的倾向比其他与列宁斯大林的世界观敌对的倾向的危险性少一些。这是非常荒谬的！文学中的这种反列宁主义的主观主义思想，伴随着不愿学习，对待古典遗产的轻蔑的虚无主义者的态度，以及认为社会主义的现实主义本身就能使作家的作品成为具有高度艺术水准的作品的看法。这种新拉普派倾向中的最危险的东西，就是它的宗派主义，党员和非党员的对立，以吆喝和命令代替教育作家的任务，使打击性的批评方法和教育性的批评相对立。
    “新拉普派分子”歪曲了列宁的文学党性的原则。他们认为文学中的党性，只有党员、共产党人才能做到，好像只有党员才能掌握社会主义现实主义的方法。
    这并不符合文学界的真实情况，其目的就是要打击非党的文学干部，使他们离开党。
    这些倾向的各种各样的色彩，在我们今天它们时常是吹着一个调子，互相换用方法，在文艺界、在会议上不倦地“工作”，伪装着，奉承着，而实际上是企图尽力歪曲和污蔑党的正确的指示。
    是的，我们不仅要公正地和彻底地揭露我们作品中思想上的缺点，而且也应当揭露艺术上的缺点。我们要想到苏维埃的优秀作家，我们要想到历史上空前未有的共产主义文学的艺术质量。正因如此，我们要在我们的队伍中展开批评与自我批评，并且将继续不断地展开，无论是这些或那些作家怎样抱怨。
    但是我们的批评是不同于我们敌人的批评的，它是公正的批评，它既指出作品中的成绩，也揭露出它的缺点。它要尽力确定某一作品给社会带来的好处或害处，如果有好处的话，那末要指出是怎样的好处，而且指出什么东西在阻碍该作品成为人民的更珍贵的精神上的宝物。
    提高工人的文化技术水平
    “劳动报”三月二十日发表社论，论述企业中的领
    导人和工会组织应当积极支持工人的文化学习，摘要
    如下：
    把工人的文化技术水平提高到工程师、技术人员的水平是共产主义建设的最重要任务之一。
    共产主义建设的利益、社会主义生产的进一步提高和完善化，都要求我们不倦地关怀劳动人民文化技术水平的提高。在完成这个重要任务方面，企业领导人和工会起着重大的作用。正是他们应当创造一切条件，以便人们能够把在学校、训练班和技术专科学校中的学习同生产工作很好地结合起来。
    但是，现在还有这样眼光短浅的领导人，他们不关心工人知识的提高，认为这是次要的事。在许多企业中，在夜校中，还有大量学生被淘汰的事实。造成这种现象的原因，是没有为青年的有成效的学习创造必要条件，这就是说，在上课的时间中，使生产工作拖住他们，或者使他们担负过多的社会活动。
    工会应当把工人的一般学习和生产技术学习作为自己经常注意的对象。工会的责任是经常监督着使青年工人学校、技术学校、高级函授学校和中级技术专科学校的所有学生，都获得顺利学习的条件。所谓创造这种顺利的学习条件是指什么呢？这首先就是指要使生产工作不侵占学生的上课时间，使他们能获得必需的教科书，而且要在宿舍里为他们创立便于完成课外作业所需的环境。
