Our Great Motherland
    While construction projects are proceeding in various locations, the project of turning wasteland into a lake in the western suburbs of Beijing has also begun. In the future, people will see a large lake, two small islands, and a ring road around the lake appear on this wasteland, becoming a scenic tourist area. From here, water can also be supplied to flush the capital's sewers, further improving the capital's environmental sanitation.
