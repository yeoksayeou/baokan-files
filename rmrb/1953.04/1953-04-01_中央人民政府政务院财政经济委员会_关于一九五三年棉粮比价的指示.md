The cotton planting area nationwide has increased year by year for the past three years, and the yield per unit area has also increased year by year. By 1952, the national cotton production could guarantee the needs of China's current textile industry and civilian cotton wadding, changing the past situation of relying on foreign cotton imports to supplement the insufficient domestic cotton. This is the result of the country's reasonable price policy and the guidance of governments at all levels and the hard work of cotton farmers. This year, the national cotton planting area should be stabilized at the 1952 level, without further expansion or reduction. Efforts should be made to actively increase the yield per unit area to complete this year's great task of cotton production. The state's purchase price for cotton in the past three years has been reasonable, ensuring the development of cotton production and the interests of cotton farmers. However, under the new conditions where national cotton production can guarantee the current needs of the textile industry and civilian cotton wadding, the past cotton-grain price ratio has revealed new shortcomings: first, the cotton-grain price difference is not entirely reasonable, and the cotton price is too high; second, there is no reasonable seasonal price difference. These shortcomings affect the normal development of cotton fields and the normal state of cotton sales, and if this continues, it will be very unfavorable. In order to stipulate a reasonable price ratio between cotton and grain and a normal seasonal price difference in 1953, to ensure that the cotton planting area does not continue to expand or decrease but remains stable at the 1952 planting area level, and to encourage cotton farmers to actively increase the yield per unit area, the following decisions are made:

(1) Cotton-grain price ratio in 1953:
	Area		Grain		Quantity of ginned cotton exchanged for grain per catty of 7/8 grade medium-staple cotton
	Hebei, Shandong	Millet		6.62 - 8 catties
	Shanxi		Millet		6.62 - 8 catties
			Wheat		6.25 - 7.5 catties
	Shaanxi Central, Henan	Wheat		6.25 - 7.5 catties
	Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan	Second-grade rice	6.62 - 8 catties
	Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui	Medium indica rice	6.62 - 8 catties
	Northeast		Red sorghum	16 - 18 catties
	Sichuan, Southern Shaanxi	To be determined by the province with reference to the above price ratio principles.

Note: Rice prices in millet areas are calculated based on local rice prices, and will be calculated based on the new rice price starting from December 1, 1953.

(2) The above cotton-grain price ratio is the price at which state-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth companies, grain companies, and cooperatives purchase cotton and sell grain to farmers. The actual price obtained by farmers for selling cotton should be maintained within this range regardless of the season. During each purchase season after the new cotton is available in 1953, a reasonable seasonal price difference should be maintained, that is, the purchase price should be slightly lower when the new cotton is available, and then gradually increased appropriately to compensate for the losses caused by moisture drying and reasonable capital interest and storage costs for farmers who store cotton. As for the grain prices in the border areas of various provinces, the commercial departments of the two provinces can negotiate according to the provisions of this instruction and report to the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government for approval, and adjust them at any time to ensure a reasonable level of the cotton-grain price ratio.

(3) Continue to implement the policy of "higher price for higher grade, lower price for lower grade" to encourage cotton farmers to develop the planting of fine cotton. In the purchase work, grading and inspection technology should be improved, and prices should be given fairly and reasonably according to grade. It is strictly forbidden to suppress grades and prices.

(4) It was previously stipulated for the public grain burden of cotton fields in 1952: In areas where the average proportion of public grain burden in cotton fields to the yield of cotton fields in the past is above 11% (for example, each mu of cotton field should produce 30 catties of ginned cotton and bear 3.3 catties), the burden method remains unchanged; in areas where the average proportion of public grain burden in cotton fields in the past is less than 11%, the average proportion of public grain burden in local cotton fields should be increased to 11%. In 1953, due to the decrease in the cotton-grain price ratio compared to 1952, agricultural tax will no longer be levied on cotton fields according to the 1952 cotton field public grain burden method, but will still be levied according to the 1951 method, that is, levied at the rate based on the normal yield (grain yield).

    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会
    关于一九五三年棉粮比价的指示
    三年来，全国棉花种植面积逐年增加，单位面积产量逐年提高，至一九五二年，全国棉花生产已能保证我国目前纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要，改变了过去依靠外棉进口补助国棉不足的情况，这是国家合理的价格政策以及各级人民政府的指导和棉农努力生产的结果。今年全国棉田种植面积应稳定在一九五二年的水平上，不再扩大但亦不降低，应积极提高单位面积产量，以完成今年棉花生产的伟大任务。三年来国家对棉花的收购价格，是合理的，保证了棉产的发展及棉农的利益。但在全国棉花生产已能保证目前纺织工业和民用絮棉需要的新条件下，过去的棉粮比价就显现出了新的缺点：一是棉粮差价不尽合理，棉价偏高；二是没有合理的季节差价。这种缺点影响了棉田的正常发展和售棉的正常状态，如果发展下去，是很不利的。为了规定一九五三年棉花和粮食的合理比价及正常的季节差价，以保证棉田种植面积不继续扩大亦不降低而稳定在一九五二年植棉面积的水平上，奖励棉农积极提高单位面积产量，特作以下的决定：
    （一）一九五三年棉粮比价：地区粮食　每斤7／8中级细绒种类　皮棉换粮数量河北　山东　小米　六斤十二两—八斤山西小米　六斤十二两—八斤小麦　六斤四两—七斤半陕中　河南　小麦六斤四两—七斤半湖北　江西　湖南　二级米六斤十二两—八斤江苏　浙江　安徽　中籼米六斤十二两—八斤东北　红粮十六斤—十八斤四川　陕南　由省参照上述比价原则自行规定。
    附注：小米区米价系按当地米价计算，自一九五三年十二月一日起按新米计算。
    （二）上述棉粮比价是国营花纱布公司、粮食公司和合作社向农民收购棉花出售粮食的价格，即农民售棉所得实价不论任何季节均应保持在此幅度以内。在一九五三年新棉上市后各收购季节中，应保持合理的季节差价，即在新棉上市时收价应稍低，以后适当的逐渐提高，以补偿存棉农民因水份干燥损耗的损失及合理的资金利息和储存费用。至于各省接壤地区粮价，可根据本指示规定由两省商业厅进行协商，报中央人民政府商业部批准，随时调整，以保证棉粮比价的合理水平。
    （三）继续实行“优级优价、低级低价”的政策，鼓励棉农发展良棉种植，在收购工作中应提高分级检验技术，公平合理按级给价，严禁压级压价。
    （四）一九五二年棉田公粮负担曾经规定：凡过去棉田的公粮负担占棉田应产量的平均比例在百分之十一（例如每亩棉田应产皮棉三十斤负担三点三斤）以上的地区，其负担办法照旧不变；过去棉田的公粮负担占棉田应产量的平均比例不及百分之十一的地区，应把当地棉田的公粮负担的平均比例提高到百分之十一。一九五三年由于棉粮比价较一九五二年降低，棉田不再按一九五二年棉田公粮负担办法征收农业税，仍照一九五一年办法征收，即按常年产量（粮食产量）依率计征。
                                主任　陈　云
                            一九五三年四月一日
