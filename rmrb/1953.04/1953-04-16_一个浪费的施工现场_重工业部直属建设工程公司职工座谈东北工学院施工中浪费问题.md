    A Wasteful Construction Site
    -- Employee Symposium of the Construction Engineering Company Directly Under the Ministry of Heavy Industry on Waste Problems During the Construction of Northeast Institute of Technology
    In the movement to oppose waste and establish a responsibility system, the employees of the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry held three consecutive symposiums to examine the errors and shortcomings in the Northeast Institute of Technology project in Shenyang. More than 30 people attended the symposium, including workers, engineers, section chiefs, construction workers, technicians, site directors, material personnel, financial personnel, transportation personnel, and engineering team leaders, all of whom participated in the construction of the Northeast Institute of Technology project in Shenyang last year. Judging from the facts they reflected, there were many shortcomings in the construction of the Northeast Institute of Technology project in Shenyang. Waste occurred commonly in materials, equipment, transportation, and labor. There were many reasons for the waste, but the main reasons were the lack of economic accounting concepts and the phenomenon of no one being responsible for construction management.
    Prioritizing Progress, Forgetting Costs
    At the symposium, everyone agreed that "only focusing on progress and not considering costs" was an important reason for the waste. Wan Nai, the former site director, said, "When we built the Institute of Technology, in order to rush the progress, we blindly asked for more materials and labor without considering economic accounting at all. We did not rationally organize the labor force. People were packed into a ten-square-meter area, bumping into each other, which affected the work. The workers said that the area was too small, and we then realized that we should allocate fifteen square meters for the workers to work on. We threw materials around randomly, and the construction site was covered with sand and stones." In late April of last year, without proper preparation, people were requested everywhere. Five hundred bricklayers were blindly transferred from Beiguan District, Shenyang. These bricklayers arrived at the Institute of Technology construction site and had nothing to do every day. They lived there for two months in vain before officially starting work. Bricklayer Zhao Liankui said, "At that time, we were really anxious. We went everywhere to ask the cadres for work to do, but the cadres just shook their heads and told us to wait. We really couldn't wait any longer! We thought, how can we be worthy of the country if we don't work? We had no choice but to pick stones and dig ditches." When using mechanical equipment, they always thought, "More machines will allow us to work faster." Technician Li Zhiran said, "When building the metallurgical hall of the Institute of Technology, three cement mixers were requested, but only two were used each day, and one was stopped. Moreover, the utilization rate of these two was only 50%." In the construction of the Institute of Technology project, there were only progress plans, but no material consumption quotas or cost reduction plans. Therefore, the construction units requested materials randomly. The people in the construction department thought, "We can ask for as many materials as we want, and the materials department must provide them; otherwise, if there is a shortage of materials in the future and the work stops, the materials department will be responsible for the downtime." Material staff member Xin Xing said, "We were afraid of taking this responsibility, so we had no choice but to provide whatever they asked for on the spot immediately. We didn't go to the site, didn't know the situation there, and didn't have a reliable material supply plan, so we couldn't stop the phenomenon of random material requests from below. We received material requests for additional budgets every day. One day, we received eighteen budgets and desperately purchased materials outside based on these budgets. After purchasing some rubble, wood, and yellow sand, the site didn't need them anymore. This inevitably led to the accumulation of materials. Last year, the Northeast Institute of Technology project accumulated 13 billion yuan worth of materials, which was the reason. Some of the accumulated materials cannot be used this year."
    Many tasks, No One Specifically Responsible
    At the symposium, everyone also pointed out that the phenomenon of no one being responsible for construction management was also a cause of waste. In the construction of the Institute of Technology project, a system of specific responsibility for specific people was not established. Many tasks were not the responsibility of anyone. Site director Wan Nai said, "We bought a lot of prefabricated concrete slabs, but no one was in charge when they were stacked, and more than a dozen were crushed at one time; no one was in charge during transportation, and more than twenty were damaged during the journey; no one was responsible for installing the concrete slabs, and many were also damaged." Although some tasks were the responsibility of someone, one person was in charge of many things, and as a result, they couldn't manage anything. There was only one construction worker in the electrical engineering team. He was responsible for checking quality, managing materials, tools, plans, and wages. He had so many responsibilities, how could he really be responsible? There was only one tool keeper in the plumbing engineering team. He was responsible for the supply and storage of tools for a 200,000-square-meter project. He was extremely busy every day, and his pockets were filled with receipts. How many tools were received? How many were damaged? He didn't know anything. Construction worker Ma Liangcheng said, "On the construction site of the Institute of Technology, it was covered with yellow ash, wood, and nails. Workers walked over it, and the nails pierced their feet. More than a dozen people were injured every day, but no one cleaned up these things." When moving red bricks, no one cared, and the lost bricks filled the road. The residents of the Tiexi Workers' Village collected these lost bricks and built a house. When the workers saw this house, they said angrily, "This is simply a joke. If we don't oppose waste, our construction will not be successful."
    Concrete Engineering of Metallurgical Hall Has Dog Holes
    During the construction of the Northeast Institute of Technology, the workers said, "We don't pay attention to quality." Construction worker Ma Liangcheng believed that the lack of attention to quality was related to the simplistic task view of the leading cadres. He remembered, "In September and October of last year, we only heard the leading cadres say, 'Hurry up! Hurry up! If you don't complete the task, you will be criticized!'" At that time, the leading cadres only focused on progress and blindly praised those who rushed the progress, saying "Those who rush the progress are heroes," but they didn't care whether the quality was good or not. Ma Liangcheng said, "I was influenced by this thought when I built the open ditch of the Northeast Institute of Technology, and I didn't care about the quality at all!" Worker Deng Yucai said, "The higher-ups urged us so tightly that we didn't follow the operating specifications. We didn't even think about the ratio of mortar." Therefore, the workers did not follow the specifications and arbitrarily increased the thickness of the plastering. The thickness of the plastering on many brick walls exceeded the standard by more than double. When the workers were plastering, they only sought speed. The mortar that fell on the ground was more than ten centimeters thick. Technician Zhang Tongfang cited the example of the concrete project of the metallurgical hall of the Institute of Technology to illustrate the seriousness of the low quality. On this concrete house, the surface was pockmarked, with dense honeycombs and numerous dog holes. Some of the largest dog holes were so large that even dogs could walk in. None of the thirty-six concrete columns met the quality standards. Some columns had to be repaired. Construction worker Li Jingyun believed that "to eliminate this phenomenon, we must oppose the simplistic task view, implement the policy of emphasizing progress, quality, and cost equally, and strictly follow the construction specifications. In the past, we did not tell the workers the quality requirements and did not let the workers learn the operating procedures. This was not right." He said, "Not improving quality is the greatest waste."
    Conflict Events Between Various Types of Work
    Due to poor construction management, lack of communication between departments, and each acting on its own, many rework and waste phenomena also occurred. In the construction process of the Northeast Institute of Technology, there were many "conflict events" between various types of work. After the bricklaying team built the walls, the plumbing team said, "Why didn't you leave us a place? Where do we install our plumbing pipes from?" Some of the repaired walls had to be dug up and rebuilt. Jin Rongxian, the captain of the electrical engineering team, said, "When we were working in the metallurgical hall, we didn't know the situation of civil engineering. We installed the closing boxes of the metallurgical hall, but the civil construction department wanted to raise the ground by twenty centimeters. We had no choice but to remove the closing boxes and reinstall them. When we installed the electrical pipes on the second floor, we found that these pipes were more than ten centimeters away from the wall, so we had to remove them and reinstall them. This kind of rework phenomenon was very common." The plumbing team installed the pipes for the washbasin water in the student dormitory, but later they found out that these pipes were lower than the washbasin and could not flow water. Therefore, they had to rework. Sometimes, the electrical engineering team installed electrical pipes, and the plumbing team said, "Your pipes and my pipes are in the way, you should give way." The workers were most afraid of this kind of fighting between each other. They said, "We worked for a long time, but we have to start all over again." Jin Rongxian believed that the reason for this phenomenon was partly because of errors in the design drawings and partly because of a lack of coordination in construction management. He said, "To do a good job in complex projects, we must organize all types of work well. Otherwise, this kind of rework will still occur."
    At the symposium, everyone agreed that the errors and shortcomings in the construction of the Northeast Institute of Technology project were serious. They were determined to strictly criticize the thinking of "only focusing on progress, neglecting quality, and disregarding costs" and resolutely oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible in this movement to oppose waste and establish a responsibility system. They said that they would learn from the lessons of the Northeast Institute of Technology, establish an economic accounting perspective, establish a responsibility system, and overcome waste in this year's construction.

    一个浪费的施工现场
    ——重工业部直属建设工程公司职工座谈东北工学院施工中浪费问题
    中央重工业部直属建设工程公司职工在反对浪费和建立责任制运动中，连续召开三次座谈会，检查沈阳东北工学院工程中的错误和缺点。参加座谈会的有工人、工程师、科长、施工员、技术员、工地主任、材料人员、财务人员、运输人员和工程队长等三十多人，他们在去年都参加了沈阳东北工学院工程的修建工作。从他们反映的事实来看，在修建沈阳东北工学院工程中有着很多的缺点，在材料、设备、运输和劳动力等方面，都普遍地发生浪费现象。发生浪费的原因是多方面的，而主要的原因，则是缺乏经济核算的观点和施工管理上存在着无人负责的现象。
    抢了进度，忘了成本
    在座谈会上，大家一致认为：“只顾进度，不计成本”是发生浪费的一个重要原因。原工地主任万耐说：“我们修筑工学院时，为了抢进度，盲目多要材料和劳动力，根本没有考虑经济核算的问题。我们没有合理地组织劳动力，在一块十平方公尺的地方，站满了人，屁股碰屁股，影响了工作。工人说这样的地方太小了，我们才发现应该划出十五平方公尺的地方，工人才能在上面工作。我们乱丢材料，工地上到处是砂石。”去年四月底，还没有做好准备工作，就到处要人，盲目地从沈阳北关区调来五百瓦工。这些瓦工到了工学院工地，天天没有事干，白白地住了两个月，才正式上班。瓦工赵连魁说：“那时候，我们心里真着急，到处找干部讨工作做，干部只摇头，要我们等等再说。我们实在等不下去呀！我们想：不工作，怎么对得起国家呢？我们只好挑石子、挖地沟。”在使用机械设备时，总以为：“多要几部机器，干起活来，快一些。”技术员李秩然说：“修筑工学院的冶金馆，要了三部洋灰搅拌机，每天只用两部，停一部，而且这两部的利用率只有百分之五十。”在修建工学院工程中，只有进度计划，没有材料消费定额和降低成本的计划，所以施工单位就乱要材料。施工部门的人以为：“我们要多少材料，材料部门就要给多少；要不然，将来缺少材料，停了工，材料部门就要负停工待料的责任。”材料员辛幸说：“我们害怕负这个责任，就只好现场要什么，马上给什么。我们没有下现场，不知道现场的情况，又没有可靠的材料供应的计划，所以也不能制止下面乱要材料的现象。我们天天接到追加材料的预算，有一天曾接到十八份预算，根据这些预算，拼命在外面购买材料。有些块石、木料、黄砂买到手之后，现场又不要了。这就不得不积压材料。去年东北工学院工程积压了价值一百三十亿元的材料，就是这个原因。有些积压的材料，今年还使用不了。”
    很多工作，无专人负责
    大家在座谈会上，还指出在施工管理上的无人负责现象，也是造成浪费的一个原因。在修建工学院工程中，没有建立专人专责的制度。许多工作，没有人负责。工地主任万耐说：“我们购买了很多预制混凝土板，但堆置时没有人管，一次压坏了十多块；运送时也没有人管，中途震坏了二十多块；安装混凝土板也没有人负责，也弄坏了好多。”有些工作，虽然有人负责，但一个人管了很多事，结果什么事也管不了。电气工程队里只有一个施工员，他要负责检查质量，管理材料、工具、计划和工薪等工作。他一个人负了这么多责任，那能真正负责呢？水暖工程队只有一个工具员，他要负责二十万平方公尺工程上的工具供应和保管的工作。每天忙得要命，口袋里塞满了收据。领了多少工具？损坏了多少？他一点也不知道。施工员马良城说：“在工学院工地上，铺满了黄灰、木料和钉子，工人们从上面走过，钉子刺坏了脚，一天总有十多个人受伤，但是就没有人去收拾这些东西。”在搬运红砖时，也没有人过问，丢失的砖头把路都填高了。铁西工人村的居民，把这些丢失的砖头收集起来，盖了一栋房子。工人们看到这个房子，就气愤地说道：“这简直是个笑话。再不反掉浪费现象，我们的建设就搞不好。”
    冶金馆的混凝土工程有狗洞
    在修筑东北工学院时，工人们说：“我们是不重视质量的。”施工员马良城认为：不重视质量，是和领导干部的单纯任务观点有关系。他记得：“在去年九、十月的时候，只听见领导干部说：快呀！快呀！完不成任务，要挨批评呀！”那时候，领导干部只抓进度，盲目表扬抢进度的人，说“抢了进度的人，就是英雄”，但不管质量好不好。马良城说：“我修筑东北工学院的明沟，就受了这个思想的影响，还管它什么质量问题哩！”工人邓玉才说：“上级催得我们紧，我们也不照着操作规范办事了。什么灰浆的比例，连想都不想了。”因此工人们不按着规范，任意增加抹灰的厚度。许多砖墙抹灰的厚度，超过标准一倍多。工人在抹灰时，只求快，灰浆掉在地上，有十多公分厚。技术员张同方举出工学院冶金馆混凝土工程的例子，说明质量低劣的严重性。在这个混凝土的房子上，麻面鳞鳞，蜂窝密密，狗洞众多。有些最大的狗洞，真是连狗都可以走进去。三十六根混凝土柱子，没有一根合乎质量标准。有些柱子，要重新修理。施工员李景云认为：“要消除这种现象，必须反对单纯任务观点，贯彻进度、质量成本并重的方针，严格按照施工规范，进行施工。过去我们没有告诉工人质量的要求，没有让工人学习操作规程。这是不应该的。”他说：“不提高质量，就是最大的浪费。”
    各个工种间的冲突事件
    由于施工管理不好，各部门互不联系，各自为政，因而也发生许多返工的浪费现象。在东北工学院的施工过程中，各个工种之间发生“冲突的事件”是很多的。瓦工队砌好了墙壁，水暖队说：“你们怎么不给我们留下位置？我们的水暖管子从那里安呀？”有些修好了的墙壁，又只好挖掉重修。电气工程队队长金荣显说：“我们在冶金馆工作时，不知道土木建筑方面的情况。我们安好了冶金馆的关闭盒子，土建方面却要把地面提高二十公分，我们只好拆掉关闭盒子，重新安装。我们安好了二楼的电气管道时，才发现这些管子离墙十多公分远，只好拆了重安。这种返工的现象是很多的。”水暖工程队把学生宿舍的洗面用水的管子安好了，但后来才知道这些管子都低于洗面台，不能流水。所以不得不返工。有时候，电气工程队安好电气管子，水暖工程队说：“你的管子和我的管子碰头了，你该让一让。”工人们最害怕这种互相打架的事情。他们说：“干了很久，结果又要重来过。”金荣显认为：发生这种现象的原因，一方面是因为设计图纸错误，另一方面是因为在施工管理上互不配合。他说：“搞好复杂的工程，就必须把各个工种很好地组织起来。否则，这种返工的事情，还会出现。”
    在座谈会上，大家一致认为：在修建东北工学院工程中所发生的错误和缺点是严重的。他们决心在这次反对浪费和建立责任制运动中，严格批判“只顾进度，忽视质量，不计成本”的思想，坚决反对无人负责的现象。他们说，要接受东北工学院的教训，树立起经济核算的观点，建立起责任制度，要在今年施工中克服浪费现象。
