Lüda City Begins Construction of New Soviet Martyrs Memorial Tower

[This Newspaper Reported] Construction has begun on a new, grand, and solemn Soviet Martyrs Memorial Tower in Stalin Square, Lüda City.

After the liberation of Lüda City, the people of Lüda built a memorial tower in Stalin Square (then called Victory Tower). Now, with the ever-growing friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and with the deepening love of the people of Lüda for the Soviet Union, the people are requesting the reconstruction of a grand Soviet Memorial Tower. The Lüda City People's Government, in accordance with the wishes of the people, formed a construction committee, made construction plans, and began preparations, design, and construction preparation work.

At present, all preparations are in place: the design drawings of the memorial tower have been completed, and various kinds of granite have been transported from Qingdao, Jinan, and Xiong Yue stone mines. The news of recruiting workers to build the memorial tower was immediately met with enthusiastic response from thousands of construction workers, who, with immense gratitude to the Soviet army, came to engage in the construction work of the memorial tower. In stone processing, everyone achieved maximum savings, and not a single one of the one thousand seven hundred and eighty pieces of stone was wasted. The slogan put forward by the construction workers is: "Guarantee completion before 'September 3rd'!"

This memorial tower will be entirely built of solid and durable granite. The completed tower will be 30.08 meters high, and the base of the tower will be 53 meters long and 17.4 meters wide. In the central reviewing stand of the tower, there will be a rostrum and guest room that can accommodate more than 300 people; the basement will have a rest room, office, etc. On the base of the tower, it will be decorated with bronze statues of Soviet soldiers and two bronze reliefs: one depicting the scene of people warmly welcoming the Soviet army when the Soviet army liberated Lüda; the other showing the strong will of the Chinese and Soviet people to unite closely to defend the Far East and world peace. On top of this, a large stone monument nearly ten meters high will be erected.

    旅大市开始修建一座新的苏军烈士纪念塔
    【本报讯】旅大市斯大林广场开始修建一座新的宏大而庄严的苏军烈士纪念塔。
    旅大市解放后，旅大人民曾在斯大林广场修建过一座纪念塔（当时名胜利塔）。如今，随着中苏两国人民友谊的日益增长，随着旅大人民对苏联热爱的加深，人民要求重建一座规模宏大的苏军纪念塔。旅大市人民政府根据人民的心愿，组成了修建委员会，作出了修建计划，着手进行筹备、设计和施工准备工作。
    目前，一切准备工作已经就绪：纪念塔的图纸设计出来了，各色各样的花岗石，从青岛、济南、熊岳石矿运来了。招工修建纪念塔的消息传出后，立刻得到千百个建筑工人的热烈响应，他们怀着无比感谢苏军的心情，来从事纪念塔的建筑工作。在石料加工中，大家都做到了最大的节约，一千七百八十块石料，一块也没有废。建筑工人们提出的口号是：“保证在‘九三’之前竣工！”
    这座纪念塔将全部用坚固耐久的花岗石砌成。落成后的塔身将高达三十点零八公尺，塔的底座长五十三公尺、宽十七点四公尺。在塔的中央检阅台上，设有能容纳三百多人的主席台和来宾室；地下室内设有休息室、办公室等。在塔的底座上，将饰以苏军战士铜像和两幅铜浮雕：一幅是当苏军解放旅大时，人们热烈欢迎苏军的场面；一幅则表现中苏两国人民紧密团结起来，保卫远东及世界和平的坚强意志。在这上面，将竖立近十公尺高的大碑石。
