　　Chongqing University Teachers Achieve Good Results in Intensive Russian Language Learning During Winter Vacation

　　Chongqing area universities organized intensive Russian language learning for teachers during the winter vacation, achieving good results. More than 200 people participated in the learning, of which 75% were professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from Chongqing area universities. The learning was divided into six groups: mathematics, physics, machinery, and "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)". After 212 hours of study, they basically mastered the grammatical knowledge needed to read Russian books in their respective fields and memorized 1,400 to 1,800 new words within their professional scope. Among the participants, 99% had either never recognized Russian letters or had only learned a little basic Russian. They improved to the level of being able to independently read Russian books in their fields with the help of a dictionary. During the learning process, the teachers adopted the "cyclic memorization method," emphasizing the combination of intensive learning and consolidation, with a certain amount of review time in each learning stage. The teachers generally achieved good results. In the first exam, the average score of the whole class was 92.3, with 39 people scoring 100; in the third exam, the average rose to 96.2, with the number of people scoring 100 increasing to 72, and the lowest score in the class was above 70.

　　General Logistics Department of the Military Commission Translates the Film "The Nervous System"

　　In order to cooperate with the study of Pavlov's theory, the Health Department of the General Logistics Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission translated a Soviet scientific educational film "The Nervous System" at the end of 1952, which was produced by the "August First Film Studio." The content of this film mainly explains the structure and function of the nervous system based on the principles of scientific evolution and Pavlov's theory of nerves. Forty copies of this film have now been reproduced and distributed to major military regions, military medical universities, and other units for screening when studying Pavlov's theory.

　　Central Film Bureau Publishes Djoleto's "Blacks in Hollywood Films" in Chinese Translation

　　The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government published the Chinese translation of "Blacks in Hollywood Films" by Djoleto, Chairman of the National Cultural Committee of the American Communist Party and a famous American writer, in early April. This is a book that profoundly exposes how American imperialism uses films to carry out reactionary racist propaganda. In this book, Djoleto sharply pointed out that the so-called "for the benefit of black people" films produced by Hollywood in recent years are a more despicable and vicious new tactic used by American imperialism to try to ease the increasingly high tide of the black liberation movement. In this book, Djoleto called on the American people to rise up and more bravely oppose American imperialism's racial discrimination and war cries, and strive to faithfully reflect the lives of black people on the screen. Djoleto's active dedication to the cause of the working people aroused the hatred of American imperialists. Djoleto, along with sixteen other prominent activists of the American Communist Party, was arrested and imprisoned in June 1951. To protest against the illegal actions of the American government, the American people established the "Committee to Defend Djoleto" and held a mass rally in New York City on March 19 this year to defend Djoleto.

　　"Liberation" Building of Xinjiang Nationalities Institute Completed

　　The "Liberation" Building, built by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Dihua to help the Xinjiang Nationalities Institute, has been completed. This T-shaped new building is very large, with more than 260 rooms. The classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and teaching and research offices of the eight departments and thirty classes of the entire institute are located here. There is also an auditorium that can accommodate more than 1,000 people. Students of all ethnic groups from all over the province have begun to happily conduct physics and chemistry experiments in the new laboratories and read their favorite social science and natural science books in the library.

　　The construction area of this new building is 5,400 square meters, which is approximately equal to the total construction area of the institute's predecessor, Xinjiang College, over the past ten years. All rooms are equipped with heating and electric lights, and the light is also sufficient. This was built by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Dihua as a voluntary labor project for the institute. In order to commemorate the sincere and selfless assistance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, students of all ethnic groups named it the "Liberation" Building.
