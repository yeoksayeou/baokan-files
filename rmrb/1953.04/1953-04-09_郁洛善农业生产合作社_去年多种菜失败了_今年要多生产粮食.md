    Yuluoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Last Year's Extensive Vegetable Planting Failed; This Year, Increase Grain Production

    The Yuluoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishagedan Village, Ji County, Hebei Province, learned from last year's lessons and reversed the idea of blindly planting various melons and vegetables. This year, its 80 mu of paddy fields are planned to focus on grain production.

    In the winter of 1951, the Yuluoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative drilled a new-style well. The following year, 18 mu of dry land became irrigated land. When drawing up the production plan, many members believed that "one mu of garden is worth ten mu of field" and "planting gardens is more profitable than growing crops." Feeling that they had not planted irrigated land for many years, and now that they had a "foreign well," they should "make a killing." In April 1952, out of these 18 mu of paddy fields, besides planting 5 mu of high-yield cotton, 5.4 mu of millet (including 4.4 mu of high-yield millet), and 1 mu of corn, the rest were planted with watermelons, winter melons, tobacco, and vegetables. At that time, they calculated that planting melons and vegetables could yield two or three harvests a year, with a minimum yield equivalent to more than 1,000 jin of millet per mu. However, in the end, the income from melons and vegetables was not as high as that from high-yield millet and high-yield cotton.

    The Yuluoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to drill three more wells this year, so that a total of 80 mu of dry land will become paddy fields (including the original 18 mu). When discussing this year's production plan, many members still wanted to "plant more melons and vegetables and less crops." Yuluoshan used the fact that the income from planting melons and vegetables last year was not much to explain to everyone. Take the 2.2 mu of watermelons and 1 mu of winter melons planted last year as an example. The total income was equivalent to 3,978 jin of millet. Without counting the extra application of coarse fertilizer and the extra labor, the soybean cake investment alone was equivalent to 2,880 jin of grain, which left only 1,098 jin of millet, averaging only 343 jin per mu. A total of 256 laborers were used for planting and selling melons, averaging 80 laborers per mu. Their 4.4 mu of high-yield millet used a total of 1,232 jin of fine fertilizer and 110 laborers (averaging 25 laborers per mu), and yielded a total of 2,663 jin of grain, averaging 605 jin per mu, which was 262 jin more per mu than watermelons and winter melons. High-yield millet also used an average of 55 fewer laborers per mu than watermelons and winter melons. Yuluoshan said: If we add the loss of reduced grain harvest due to the reduced irrigation area because of planting more vegetables (planting vegetables requires more water), the loss would be even greater. After this detailed calculation, the members all agreed to focus on increasing grain production. This year, their 80 mu of paddy fields are planned to plant 3.5 mu of vegetables, which is enough for the members to eat. The rest of the paddy fields will be planted with 26 mu of millet, with a planned average yield of 954 jin per mu. Among them, there are 20 mu of high-yield millet, which are required to yield 1,000 to 1,200 jin per mu. The rest of the paddy fields have been planted with 10 mu of wheat, and it is planned to plant spring wheat and other early-maturing crops to help the members get through the spring famine.

### 郁洛善农业生产合作社  去年多种菜失败了  今年要多生产粮食

    郁洛善农业生产合作社
    去年多种菜失败了  今年要多生产粮食
    河北省冀县西沙疙疸村郁洛善农业生产合作社接受了去年的教训，扭转了盲目多种瓜菜的思想，今年八十亩水田计划以生产粮食为主。
    一九五一年冬天，郁洛善农业生产合作社里，锥了一眼新式井，第二年就有十八亩旱田变成了水浇地。订生产计划时，有好多社员认为“一亩园、十亩田”、“种园子比庄稼收入多”，觉着多年没有种过水浇地，这一回有了“洋井”，可该“捞一把”了。一九五二年四月里，这十八亩水田，除去种了五亩丰产棉花、五亩四分谷子（内有四亩四分丰产谷）、一亩玉米以外，其余的都种了西瓜、北瓜、烟和蔬菜。当时他们盘算着种瓜菜一年能收两三季，最少每亩收成能折合谷子一千多斤。可是，结果，瓜菜还没有丰产谷和丰产棉花的收入多。
    郁洛善农业生产合作社计划今年再打三眼井，共有八十亩旱田变成水田（连原来十八亩地在内）。在讨论今年生产计划时，好多社员还是愿“多种瓜菜，少种庄稼”。郁洛善用去年种瓜菜收入并不多的事实，向大家作了解释。单拿去年种的二亩二分西瓜和一亩北瓜来说吧，总共收入折合谷子三千九百七十八斤，不算多施的粗肥和多用的人工，光是豆饼投资折谷就是二千八百八十斤；这就只剩了一千零九十八斤谷子，平均每亩才合三百四十三斤。连种地带卖瓜共用人工二百五十六个，平均每亩用工八十个。他们那四亩四分丰产谷，共用细肥一千二百三十二斤，共用人工一百一十个（平均每亩用工二十五个），共收谷二千六百六十三斤，平均每亩合六百零五斤。比西瓜、北瓜每亩多收二百六十二斤。丰产谷比西瓜、北瓜平均每亩还少用人工五十五个。郁洛善说：如果再加上因为多种菜缩小了浇地面积（种菜费水多），少收粮食的损失就更大了。这样算细账以后，社员们就都赞成以增产粮食为主了。今年他们的八十亩水田，计划种三亩半蔬菜，够社员吃的就算了。其余的水田，种二十六亩谷子，计划平均每亩产九百五十四斤。其中有二十亩丰产谷，要求每亩产一千斤到一千二百斤。其余水田已种了十亩小麦，并计划种春麦和其他早熟庄稼，来支持社员度过春荒。（耿彦龄）
