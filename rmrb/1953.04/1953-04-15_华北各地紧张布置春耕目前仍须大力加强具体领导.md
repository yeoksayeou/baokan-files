    [From Our Newspaper] Leading organs in various provinces of North China have successively issued instructions on spring ploughing production, convened meetings of cadres at all levels to mobilize for spring ploughing, and dispatched inspection teams and groups to rural areas to inspect spring work. Some counties that had not established production offices have now done so, and those with production offices that had become empty shells have been replenished. However, as of early April, spring ploughing production in many parts of North China remains in a very inactive state. From the perspective of leadership at the county level and above, spring ploughing production work is being arranged intensely, and the concept of "spring ploughing production being the overriding central task in rural areas" has been established. However, much of the work done in many places basically remains only "convening meetings, arranging at each level, and implementing layer by layer," with slogans being shouted loudly, but concrete problems being resolved insufficiently. The mass manure accumulation movement has generally only completed slightly more than 60% of the plan; in Hebei Province, the sale of fine fertilizer has only completed one-quarter of the task, and in Shanxi only one-tenth; the rural "plan-making movement" has also mostly degenerated into formalism. Natural disasters, especially drought and insect pests, are gradually becoming more serious threats to agriculture, but leading cadres in many counties and districts still do not clearly understand the disaster situation and soil moisture conditions, or have not taken urgent and effective measures to help and lead the masses to fight against disasters. It is estimated that more than 12 million mu of land in Hebei cannot be sown due to drought, and the area along the Yellow River in Shanxi and the Yimeng area of Suiyuan are also too dry to sow. Although wheat aphids and red spiders have been vigorously controlled in some areas, they are still spreading, with more than 20 counties in Hebei and Shanxi provinces having been affected. These are the most pressing and serious problems in current agricultural production in various parts of North China.
    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on spring ploughing production, the phenomenon of neglecting spring ploughing production in various parts of North China has greatly changed. However, even now, "spring ploughing production being the overriding central task" has still not been achieved in districts and villages. Most county-level leading cadres only have an empty concept of "attaching importance to spring ploughing production" and lack concrete methods to achieve this requirement. There are still not many county party secretaries and county heads who go deep into the countryside, deep into the masses, and study production policies and technologies. As of early April, Hongdong in Shanxi was still conducting twelve tasks simultaneously, and spring ploughing production had not become the central task. The responsible cadres of the county are anxious but helpless because the other tasks imposed by the higher authorities are too heavy and must be completed. Most districts also only have three or five cadres who can go to the countryside to work. Even the cadres stationed in villages by various departments and the "work teams" sent to rural areas by various counties often have their own separate agendas and do not cooperate with each other. In Yuancheng Village, Xincheng County, Hebei, six cadres went there in one day, convened six meetings, and arranged six tasks; in Shicao Village, Changzhi, Shanxi, none of the ten cadres stationed in the village inquired about agricultural production. How provinces and counties can help cadres at all levels rationally arrange various tasks and resolutely suspend or postpone tasks that hinder current spring ploughing production is still a problem that urgently needs to be solved.
    Another obstacle to spring ploughing production in various parts of North China is that some district and village cadres have an incorrect understanding of the struggle to rectify the Party and oppose bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, and therefore show negative and withdrawn emotions. Some cadres say: "If you are not active in your work, you will at most be criticized, but if you commit commandism, you will be punished. Let's choose the lighter task!" They often show a lack of boldness when accepting tasks. Last year, tasks were blindly "added level by level," and this year, tasks are blindly "lowered level by level." In addition, many rural work cadres are not at ease with rural work, lack a correct understanding of the relationship between industry and agriculture, and always want to work in cities and factories. How to conduct propaganda and education on the correct relationship between industry and agriculture and propaganda and education on the policy of opposing bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline is also a problem that urgently needs to be solved.
    In the past, some areas of North China made hasty and rash mistakes in developing agricultural production cooperatives, which harmed the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses; rectification has been carried out in various places and has achieved results. However, the thinking of many county, district, and village cadres has still not been clarified, and there is still "emphasis on cooperatives and neglect of mutual aid teams" in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The fifteen cadres in Yuci, Shanxi, who were doing cooperative building work, neither built cooperatives on the basis of consolidating mutual aid teams, nor improved mutual aid teams through building cooperatives, causing the mutual aid teams in the fifteen villages to be in a state of spontaneity. Due to the lack of leadership, 284 mutual aid teams in Xinjiang County collapsed. There are still forty villages in Youyu County without mutual aid teams. In correcting the hasty and rash deviations in running cooperatives, there are still many outstanding issues (such as the handling of livestock, fertilizers, and public property) that have not been resolved. This is also an obstacle to spring ploughing production.

### 华北各地紧张布置春耕目前仍须大力加强具体领导

    华北各地紧张布置春耕目前仍须大力加强具体领导
    【本报讯】华北各省领导机关先后发出了关于春耕生产的指示，并召开了各级干部会议进行了春耕动员，还派了检查团、检查组到各地农村检查春季工作，有些县未成立生产办公室的成立了起来，有生产办公室但已成为空壳的也充实了起来。但是，从四月初的情况来看，华北许多地区的春耕生产仍然处于很不活跃的状态。从县级以上的领导方面来说，是紧张地布置着春耕生产工作，并树立了“春耕生产是当前农村压倒一切的中心任务”的观念。可是，许多地方所做的工作基本上仍然只是“召开会议，逐级布置，层层贯彻”，口号喊得很响，具体问题解决得不多。群众的积肥运动，一般只完成计划百分之六十强；河北省推销细肥只完成任务四分之一，山西只完成任务十分之一；农村的“订计划运动”也大多流于形式主义。自然灾害，特别是干旱和虫害，对于农业的威胁正在逐渐严重起来，可是许多县区的领导干部对于灾情、墒情仍然了解不清楚，或者没有采取紧急的有效的措施，帮助和领导群众与灾害作斗争。据估计，河北因干旱不能播种的土地已达一千二百多万亩，山西沿黄河一带和绥远的伊盟地区也干旱得不能播种。小麦蚜虫和红蜘蛛虽有部分地区已经大力除治，但却仍在蔓延，河北、山西两省已先后有二十多县发生。这是华北各地当前农业生产中最迫切最严重的问题。
    中共中央发出关于春耕生产的指示以后，华北各地不重视春耕生产的现象已有了很大转变。但是，直到现在，“春耕生产是压倒一切的中心任务”在区、村仍然没有能够做到。县级领导干部大多只有一个“重视春耕生产”的空洞的观念，而缺少实现这个要求的具体办法。县委书记和县长深入农村、深入群众、钻研生产政策和技术的仍然不多。到四月初，山西洪洞仍然同时进行着十二项工作，春耕生产没有成为中心。县的负责干部干着急没有办法，因为上边压下来的其他任务太重，不完成不行。大多数区也只有三几个干部能下乡工作。就是各部门的驻村干部和各县派到农村的“工作组”，也有很多是各来一套，不相配合。河北新城县袁家庄一天就去了六个干部，召开了六次会议，布置了六项工作；山西长治石曹村驻村十个干部，无一人过问农业生产。各省县如何帮助各级干部合理地安排各种工作，把妨碍当前春耕生产的工作坚决停办或缓办，还是一个急应注意解决的问题。
    华北各地春耕生产中的另一个障碍是有些区、村干部对于整党和反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪的斗争有不正确的认识，因之表现出消极退缩的情绪。有的干部说：“工作不积极顶多受批评，犯了强迫命令要受处分，拣着轻的干吧！”他们在接受任务时多表现出不大胆。去年是盲目地“逐级追加”任务，今年是盲目地“逐级压低”任务。此外，还有许多农村工作干部不安心于农村工作，对于工业、农业的关系缺乏正确的认识，总想到城市、工厂里去工作。如何进行关于工业农业的正确关系的宣传教育和反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的政策的宣传教育，也是当前急应注意解决的问题。
    华北有些地区过去在发展农业生产合作社中犯了急躁冒进的错误，伤害了农民群众的生产积极性；目前各地已经进行纠正，取得了成效。但是，许多县区村干部思想仍然没有搞通，在互助合作运动中仍然有“重社轻组”思想。山西榆次十五个做建社工作的干部，既没有在整顿互助组的基础上进行建社，也没有通过建社去提高互助组，使十五个村的互助组都处于自流状态。新绛县的互助组由于缺乏领导，有二百八十四个组垮了台。右玉全县还有四十个村没有互助组。在纠正办社的急躁冒进偏向中，也还有不少遗留问题（如牲口、肥料、公共财产的处理等）没有解决。这也是春耕生产中的一个障碍。
