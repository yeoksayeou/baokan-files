    Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and Luojia Township, Nanchong County,
    Establish Various Systems to Regularize the Work of Implementing the Marriage Law
    In the concluding stage of the movement to implement the Marriage Law in Chengdu, the city has earnestly established various systems to regularize the work of implementing the Marriage Law.

    The movement to implement the Marriage Law in Chengdu concluded in early April. The offices of the city and district committees for the implementation of the Marriage Law held various meetings from the bottom up before the end of the movement to summarize the achievements of the movement, deal with remaining issues, and point out the direction and methods for regularizing the work of implementing the Marriage Law in the future, so that the masses can be regularly educated on the Marriage Law.

    All districts in the city carried out the work of improving grassroots mediation organizations. More than 800 activists who had practically handled family and marriage issues during the movement, basically mastered the policies, and began to establish prestige among the masses have been developed into mediators. The mediation groups of each police station in the First District have also established a rotation system to promptly mediate family disputes among the masses.

    Each district has also established a system for regularly inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law. Generally, the Civil Affairs Section, the Judicial Section, the Communist Youth League Working Committee, and the Democratic Women's Federation jointly form an inspection team to inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law in the jurisdiction of the police station or township once a month, promptly handle marriage and family disputes among the masses, and assist the mediation group in its work. The Sixth District also stipulates that each police station and grassroots unit in the countryside should hold a meeting once a month to check the implementation of the Marriage Law in conjunction with the central work, and cooperate with the district judicial section and mediation group to promptly handle marriage disputes. The Fourth District also stipulates that propaganda materials related to the implementation of the Marriage Law should be regularly provided to propagandists throughout the district. The First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Chengdu has also decided that a district committee member will be specifically responsible for leading this work.

    The Chengdu Municipal People's Government and the Chengdu Municipal Democratic Women's Federation plan to strengthen the leadership of areas where the Marriage Law has been implemented well during the movement, so that they can play a demonstration role; and summarize some of the successful publicity methods and experiences in the movement and promote them throughout the city.

    Luojia Township in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, has established a system for regularly implementing the Marriage Law. After the end of the movement to implement the Marriage Law in Luojia Township, village and township cadres and the masses generally had the idea of "getting things done," thinking that the task had been completed. Some cadres said: "The Marriage Law is known to the masses, so what else is there to do?" In response to the above situation, the township leadership, in conjunction with the spring plowing production conference, convened a meeting of cadres above the level of village team leaders, criticized the above-mentioned idea of "getting things done" and complacency, and pointed out that although the implementation of the Marriage Law has achieved certain results, this is only the beginning. Continuing to implement the Marriage Law, continuing to mobilize women to participate in social activities and labor production, and realizing equality between men and women in all aspects are still arduous and long-term tasks in the future. Then, a meeting of the township's main cadres was convened to study how to regularly implement the Marriage Law in conjunction with production, and it was stipulated that the township's main cadres, the secretaries of the Chinese Communist Party branch and the Communist Youth League branch, and all members of the women's representative meeting should meet once a month to check and study solutions to issues related to the implementation of the Marriage Law. In addition, the township's women's representative committee also formulated a plan, deciding to hold a township women's representative meeting every two months and a township women's committee meeting every fifteen days, with the aim of collecting information, making suggestions, and reporting to the township people's government for resolution; women representatives from each village and group are responsible for taking the lead in implementation, earnestly studying the Marriage Law, and mobilizing women to actively participate in production and social activities, especially paying attention to maternal and child health care.

    The Luojia District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has introduced the experience of Luojia Township to all townships in the district, instructing each township to regularly implement the Marriage Law through various meetings in conjunction with production, and to establish various systems for implementing the Marriage Law organizationally.

    四川省成都市和南充县罗家乡
    建立各种制度使贯彻婚姻法工作经常化
    成都市在贯彻婚姻法运动结束阶段，为使贯彻婚姻法工作经常化，认真订立了各种制度。
    成都市贯彻婚姻法运动已在四月上旬结束。市、区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室在运动结束前曾由下而上地分别举行了各种会议，总结运动的成果，处理遗留问题，并指出了今后贯彻婚姻法工作经常化的方向和方法，以便使群众经常受到婚姻法的教育。
    全市各区分别进行了健全基层调解组织的工作。在运动中实际地处理过家庭、婚姻问题，基本上能掌握政策，并在群众中开始树立了威信的八百多名积极分子，已被发展为调解员。第一区各派出所的调解小组，还建立了轮流办公制度，以便及时调解群众中的家庭纠纷。
    各区还建立了经常检查贯彻婚姻法工作的制度。一般的是以区民政科、司法科、青年团工作委员会、民主妇女联合会等单位，共同组成检查小组，每月到派出所辖区或乡检查一次婚姻法的执行情况，及时处理群众中发生的有关婚姻及家庭纠纷问题，并帮助调解组进行工作。第六区并规定各派出所和乡村基层单位每月要召开一次会议，结合中心工作检查一次贯彻执行婚姻法的情况，并配合区司法科、调解组及时处理婚姻纠纷。第四区还规定了经常供给全区宣传员有关贯彻婚姻法的宣传材料。中共成都市第一区委员会还决定由一个区委会委员专门负责领导这一工作。
    成都市人民政府和成都市民主妇女联合会计划对在运动中贯彻婚姻法较好的地区，加强领导，使其起到示范作用；并总结运动中的一些成功的宣传方式和经验，推广全市。    （新华社）
    四川省南充县罗家乡建立了经常贯彻婚姻法的制度。罗家乡在贯彻婚姻法运动结束后，乡村干部和群众普遍存在着“了事”思想，认为任务已经完成。有些干部说：“婚姻法群众都知道了，还有啥子搞头。”针对以上情况，乡领导方面结合春耕生产大会召开了各村小组长以上干部会议，批判了上述“了事”思想和自满情绪，指出贯彻婚姻法虽有一定成绩，但这仅是一个开端。继续贯彻婚姻法，继续发动妇女参加社会活动，参加劳动生产，在各方面实现男女平等，还是今后艰巨的长期工作。接着又召开了乡的主要干部会议，研究如何结合生产经常贯彻婚姻法，并规定每月召开一次乡的主要干部、中共支部和青年团支部书记、妇女代表全体委员会议，检查和研究解决有关贯彻婚姻法的问题。此外，乡的妇女代表委员会也订出计划，决定两个月开一次乡的妇女代表会，十五天开一次乡的妇女委员会，目的是搜集情况，提出意见，向乡人民政府汇报解决；各村、组妇女代表包干负责带头执行，认真学习婚姻法，发动妇女积极参加生产和社会活动，特别是重视妇婴保健工作。
    中共罗家区委员会已将罗家乡的经验介绍给全区各乡，指示各乡结合生产运用各种会议经常贯彻婚姻法，并从组织上建立各种贯彻婚姻法的制度。
