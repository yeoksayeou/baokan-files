Famous French Peace Warrior Yves Farge

Yves Farge, a dear friend of the Chinese people, a famous leader of the French peace movement, and winner of the Stalin Prize "For Strengthening International Peace," unfortunately passed away on March 30th.

He was an ardent French patriot who dedicated his life to the cause of defending France's honor and freedom. During the years when France was ravaged by the Hitlerite bandits, he founded the first guerrilla unit of French patriots, conducting heroic struggles against the Nazi occupiers and the Vichy traitors. The surging development of France's National Front and national liberation movement is inseparable from his contributions.

After the end of World War II, Farge was elected chairman of the National Peace Council of France, becoming the leader of a nationwide organization of French peace warriors. At the same time, he was an active organizer and participant in various international peace conferences. Together with the French people, he waged persistent struggles for France's national independence, for ending the US imperialist occupation, for France's withdrawal from the shameful North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and for cooperation with peace-loving countries.

In May 1952, when our country held a commemorative conference for four world-renowned cultural figures, Farge was invited to China. At that time, it was when the American aggressors' heinous bacteriological warfare in China and Korea was being exposed and was being angrily condemned by people all over the world. He personally went to Northeast China and Korea to conduct on-the-spot investigations and wrote the book "Evidence Seen in China and Korea." He used the evidence he personally saw, heard, and even touched to accuse the American imperialists of their bloody crimes to the whole world.

Farge loved the people's just cause. When he visited China, he was infinitely excited by the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. He once said: "I have a deep feeling of trust in the Chinese people. The Chinese people have achieved great national unity...I deeply appreciate the superiority of your New Democratic politics."

The cause of defending national independence and defending peace, for which Farge fought all his life, will be inherited and persisted in by the French people. Farge's friends all over the world will also always remember him and his spirit of loyal struggle for the cause of peace.

    法国著名和平战士伊夫·法奇
    中国人民的亲爱的朋友、法国和平运动著名领袖、“加强国际和平”斯大林奖金得奖人伊夫·法奇，不幸于三月三十日逝世。
    他是法国的热情的爱国者，他将他的一生贡献给保卫法国的荣誉和自由的事业。在法国遭受希特勒匪徒蹂躏的年代，他创立了第一支法国爱国者的游击队，对纳粹占领者及维希投敌分子进行了英勇的斗争，法国的民族阵线和民族解放运动的澎湃发展是与他的功绩分不开的。
    第二次世界大战结束后，法奇被选为全法和平理事会的主席，成为法国和平战士全国性组织的领袖。同时，他又是历次国际和平大会的积极的组织者和参加者，他和法国人民一起，为法国的民族独立，为结束美帝国主义的占领，为法国退出可耻的北大西洋公约联盟，为与爱好和平的各国进行合作，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。
    一九五二年五月，当我国举行世界四大文化名人纪念大会时，法奇应邀到我国来。那时正是美国侵略者在我国和朝鲜进行罪恶的细菌战被揭发并遭到全世界人民愤怒谴责的时候，他曾亲自到我国东北和朝鲜进行了实地调查，并写出了“在中国和朝鲜看到的证据”一书，他用他的亲自看到的听到的甚至抚摸过的证据向全世界控诉了美国帝国主义者血腥的罪行。
    法奇热爱人民的正义的事业。当他访问我国时，他对我国人民在毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下所获得的辉煌成就，无限兴奋。他曾说过：“我对中国人民怀有一种深深信任的感情。中国人民已实现了全国的大团结，……我深深体会到你们新民主主义政治的优越性。”
    法奇毕生为之奋斗的保卫民族独立和保卫和平的事业，法国人民会继承起来坚持下去的。法奇的遍布全世界的友人也将永远怀念着他和他对和平事业忠诚奋斗的精神。
