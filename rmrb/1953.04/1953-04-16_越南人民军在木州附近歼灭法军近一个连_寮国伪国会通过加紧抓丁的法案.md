Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: According to Vietnam News Agency on April 13th: On March 28th, the French troops besieged in Na San ventured out to the southeast, scurrying towards the vicinity of Zhan Tun and Gu Rui. The People's Army intercepted these restless French troops 24 kilometers northwest of Muang Xua, annihilating nearly a company of French troops belonging to the French 6th Parachute Battalion. The French troops were forced to retreat.

On the night of April 4th, the People's Army eliminated the French strongholds of De Xi and Wen Zhu northwest of Phu Ly, south of Hanoi. They also captured the French stronghold of Qiong Lang, 23 kilometers north of Thai Binh. In the battle to capture the Qiong Lang stronghold, the People's Army annihilated 144 enemy soldiers, including 125 who surrendered or were captured. The People's Army captured one 60mm mortar, nine automatic weapons, 150 rifles, and a large amount of food and equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: Saigon dispatch: Under the orders of US and French imperialists, the Laotian puppet regime is taking measures to intensify the expansion of the Laotian puppet army, implementing the US policy of "using Asians to fight Asians."

The Laotian puppet National Assembly passed the so-called "General Mobilization Act" on April 6th, conscripting men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five and reservists throughout the country into the puppet army to serve as cannon fodder. It is revealed that, according to the US-French plan to expand the puppet army, the number of Laotian puppet troops will increase from the current 13,000 to 50,000 or 60,000.

In order to urge the Laotian puppet regime to speed up the implementation of this law, General Salan, commander-in-chief of the French invading Indochina army, personally flew to Luang Prabang on the 10th to hold "talks" with the puppet king of Laos.

    寮国伪国会通过加紧抓丁的法案
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社十三日讯：三月二十八日，被围困在那岑的法军冒险向东南出击，窜到沾屯、固锐附近。人民军在木州西北二十四公里处截击了这支蠢动的法军，歼灭属于法军第六伞兵营的法军近一个连。法军被迫退了回去。
    四月四日夜里，人民军在河内以南的府里西北地方拔除了德溪、文朱的法军据点，又在太平以北二十三公里处攻克法军据点琼朗。在攻克琼朗据点的战斗中，人民军歼敌军一百四十四人，其中投降和被俘的有一百二十五人。人民军缴获六○公厘迫击炮一门、自动武器九挺、步枪一百五十支和许多粮食、装备。
    【新华社十四日讯】西贡消息：在美、法帝国主义命令下，寮国伪政权正在采取措施加紧扩充寮国伪军，实行美国的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。
    寮国伪国会在四月六日通过了在全国各地抓丁的所谓“总动员法案”。根据这个法案，寮国伪政权将把十八岁到三十五岁的男子和后备队强征到伪军里去，充当炮灰。据透露，按照美法的扩充伪军计划，寮国伪军的数目将从目前的一万三千人增加到五、六万人。
    为了督促寮国伪政权加紧实施这个法案，法国侵略印度支那军总司令萨兰曾在十日亲自飞到琅勃刺邦去，和寮国的傀儡国王进行了“会谈”。
