Reader's Letters Summary

    Cadres Leading Agricultural Production
    Should Study Agricultural Science and Technology
    Huang Deyu of the Songjiang County Agricultural and Forestry Section writes: Recently, the Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Jiangsu Province held a meeting to study the 1953 production increase plan. When everyone was enthusiastically discussing how to promote the advanced experience of "small-seedling square close planting," Comrade Guo Yuhan, Secretary of the County Party Committee, asked Comrade Zhang Shuming, Secretary of the Caojing District Party Committee: "What is small-seedling square close planting?" Comrade Zhang Shuming could not answer, and many other responsible comrades engaged in rural work were also unclear. At another meeting, Comrade Guo Yuhan asked Wu Meiyu, head of the County Agricultural and Forestry Section, to answer this question, but Wu Meiyu also said he didn't know. This is indeed a noteworthy issue. The "small-seedling square close planting" of rice is the advanced experience of Chen Yongkang, a labor model in this county, and has been proven to be in line with scientific principles in many places across the country. Our District Party Secretary and head of the Agricultural and Forestry Section, as well as many cadres engaged in rural work, do not understand it. How will they promote it? The reason for this situation is mainly that these comrades have not recognized the significance of learning "technology" for leading agricultural production, and therefore do not pay attention to agricultural production technology. Obviously, without understanding technology, one cannot lead production well. It is recommended that every cadre leading agricultural production should study agricultural science and technology well.

    Feng Yingxiang, Secretary of the Cixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Goes Deep into the Fields to Inspect Spring Plowing and Soil Moisture Conservation Work
    Readers Wang Datian, Wang Tingyu, and Zhang Youyu write: On March 20th, Comrade Feng Yingxiang, Secretary of the Cixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hebei Province, went to Qugou, Daying, and other villages in the first district to deeply inspect the spring plowing and soil moisture conservation work of the masses. He personally went to the fields to check the soil moisture. After inspecting the Xigang Slope in Daying Village, he found that most of the forty-odd plots of land (about 120 mu) had been plowed last year, but had not yet been harrowed, and the soil moisture had evaporated two or three fingers deep. Continuing like this will inevitably affect the sowing work. Comrade Feng Yingxiang took the opportunity of the district holding a meeting of village cadres to immediately mobilize the district and village cadres to pay attention to this issue, and to deeply educate the masses to do a good job in spring plowing and soil moisture conservation. County and district leaders going deep into the masses to inspect production is indeed an important method of leading production.

    Deputy Director of Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, etc.
    Go Down to the Countryside to Publicize Advanced Agricultural Production Experience
    Reader Lin Qirong writes: On March 9th, the Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Chief of the Minhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Construction (Note: the names were not specified in the letter), along with more than ten cadres, went to Huyuzhen in the fourth district of Minhou County to understand the spring plowing production situation and promote advanced agricultural production technology. They spent three evenings training mutual aid team leaders, production committee members, and other cadres in the town, introducing many advanced agricultural technologies. On the evening of March 24th, after the village staged a short play promoting the Marriage Law, they compiled advanced production experiences such as deep plowing and multiple harrowing, selecting good seeds, appropriate seedling beds, sparse sowing, pest control, small-seedling close planting, applying fertilizer in stages and rationally, and shallow water irrigation into a allegro performance, which enabled more than 3,000 theatergoers to receive publicity and education on advanced agricultural technology.

    At present, spring plowing production is the overriding central task in rural areas. Responsible cadres personally going down to the countryside to understand the spring plowing situation, and using all possible opportunities to carry out publicity and education on advanced agricultural technologies, is of great help in boosting the masses' confidence in increasing production.

    Farmers in Zhao Jiatun Have Built an Irrigation Canal
    Reader Lu Tianhong writes: Zhao Jiatun in Hesha Township, Eighth District, Lingchuan County, Guangxi, recently built a five-li-long irrigation canal. It was really not easy to build this canal!

    Zhao Jiatun and Wu Jiacun are both located in the Damendabei area. Many years ago, the farmers of Zhao Jiatun wanted to build a canal here. However, Wu Bangyan, a landlord in Wu Jiacun, was a power holder. He occupied this area and stubbornly refused to allow the construction. The two villages had many disputes, but in the old society, "reason" belonged to the landlords. The farmers of Zhao Jiatun could not afford to build a canal, so they had to raise 10,000 jin of grain every year to repair waterwheels, which could only save some of the rice seedlings. For a long time, the farmers of Zhao Jiatun lost a lot of grain!

    In 1949, the local area was liberated. In the spring of 1950, the People's Government called on farmers to build water conservancy projects. The farmers of Zhao Jiatun immediately proposed to build a canal, and the County People's Government approved it. However, at that time, the land reform had not yet been carried out, and the landlord Wu Bangyan provoked the farmers of Wu Jiacun to stop it. The two villages had another dispute. The County People's Government learned of Wu Bangyan's crimes and arrested him; however, the canal construction was eventually shelved due to the dispute between the two villages.

    After land reform and various political movements, the farmers' awareness has been raised. They realized that to increase production, they must build water conservancy projects. At the end of January this year, the Wu Camp, Hesha, and Beitang townships established a water conservancy construction committee to jointly build the Damendabei water conservancy project, which is of great benefit to the three townships. The local farmers are very happy!

    Speaking only of the branch canal in Zhao Jiatun, the farmers calculated that the cost of the canal construction materials was only equivalent to the grain used to repair waterwheels in the past year; after the canal was built, only more than 200 mu of the village's more than 1,200 mu of land would not benefit. The village's mass meeting decided: free labor, no compulsion, and a wage of seven jin of grain per work unit; and each mu of land benefiting would contribute ten jin of grain. The People's Government also loaned 2.5 million yuan for water conservancy. Construction began on February 21st. Out of 107 households in the village, an average of more than 150 people worked every day; regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, everyone worked hard. The original 13-day project was completed in 10 days. The winding canal water slowly flows, adding a lot of happiness to the farmers of Zhao Jiatun, and their production enthusiasm is even higher.

    Farmers in Beiliugu Village and Yao Village, Yongnian County
    Plant Windbreaks to Improve Agricultural Production
    Reader Zhao Mingjie writes: Beiliugu Village and Yao Village in the Fifth District of Yongnian County, Hebei, are very close to the Shahe River. In the past, every spring, the wind and sand would bury the crops, and farmers along the river suffered great losses. From 1950 to 1952, the farmers of Beiliugu Village and Yao Village planted 5.7 hectares of windbreaks, which have now grown into dense small forests. The land along the river has been protected by the forests and has been able to harvest good yields. For example, Zhao Laisuo's seven mu of land along the river in Yao Village always only saw sowing but no seedlings before the afforestation; since the afforestation, the peanuts planted in 1951 yielded 24 jin per mu, and last year the cotton harvested a total of 1,030 jin. Therefore, the farmers along the river have a high enthusiasm for afforestation. Last winter, the farmers of the two villages planted another 2.45 hectares of windbreaks, and this year they planted another 38,000 large white poplars. The farmers of the two villages have also jointly formulated forest protection regulations to protect the windbreak belt; under the protection of men, women, old, and young in the two villages, all the trees are well protected. It is hoped that rural areas with wind and sand disasters will learn from Beiliugu Village and Yao Village.

    Yao Women in the Eighth District of Jianghua County
    Actively Participate in Afforestation Work
    Li Zhiying of the Xiangnan District Democratic Women's Federation writes: Yao women in the Eighth District of Jianghua County, Xiangnan, actively participate in afforestation work. During the afforestation campaign in the winter of 1952, Pan Manmei, a Yao woman from Pingchongyuan Village in Zhangmu Township, and 20 other women in the village planted a total of 1,500 seedlings and sowed more than 10,000 seedlings. Zheng Youmei in the township is busy with housework every day, but she also planted 1,500 trees and led 18 people to plant trees and sow tree seeds, totaling 40,000. During this year's spring afforestation campaign, Feng Li Ying, the 64-year-old grandmother of Feng Chongkun, a representative of the Yao people in Popowan, Miaozi Township, got up early every morning and went barefoot to collect tree seeds. On the 24th day of the first lunar month, she collected more than 600 fir seedlings. She said, "I am old, but my mind (referring to thought) is not old. I remember Chairman Mao, and I want to respond to his call, work harder on afforestation, and seek happiness for future generations." Her actions have motivated many people in Miaozi Township to participate in afforestation work.

    According to incomplete statistics, in the spring afforestation work, the Eighth District of Jianghua County has planted more than 1.11 million fir trees, about 300,000 pine trees, 685 fruit trees, more than 4,000 oak trees, 440 jujube trees, and more than 4,500 bamboo trees. A total of 1,392 Yao women from 13 townships participated in afforestation.

    Several Issues to Note in Willow Cutting and Barren Hill Sowing
    Letters from Hao Jingsheng, Researcher of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wang Jinmao, Director of the Forestry Department of the North China Administrative Committee, and Yu Linrui, Deputy Director of the Forestry Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture: We have found that there are some technical problems in willow cutting and barren hill sowing in rural areas of Shanxi, which will prevent the inserted willow cuttings and sown tree seeds from surviving. This is a major issue that needs to be resolved in a timely manner, otherwise, the spring afforestation work will suffer greater losses. Now we will tell you about the situation we have discovered and our opinions, hoping to attract the attention of local and agricultural and forestry departments in areas with similar situations.

    In terms of willow cutting, there are four issues that need attention: (1) In some places, the cuttings are too sparse, so the willow cuttings will not grow tall, fast, straight, or into timber. One plant should be inserted every two or three feet away; if the distance is further apart, it will not be good. Second, some places use willow cuttings that are too long. Willow cuttings longer than four feet are not easy to sprout, not easy to take root, and the groundwater is not easy to reach the branches and leaves, so they are not easy to survive. Cuttings one and a half to two feet long should be used, with one or two inches exposed and more than one foot buried underground. After survival, leave a strong branch to grow into a tree. Third, the cuttings are buried too shallow. In some places, the willow cuttings are only buried half a foot deep underground, which is not acceptable. It is necessary to bury them deeper, it is better to bury them deeper than shallower. Fourth, the time for willow cutting is too late. In some places, the willows have already bloomed, and it is not easy to plant willows again. It is advisable to plant them during the early and middle "Fu" periods of the rainy season or after autumn, seizing the season for planting.

    In terms of barren hill sowing, there are the following four issues that need attention:
    First, "seize the water." It is not permissible to sow seeds in dry places, especially southwest-facing slopes and south-facing slopes; north-facing slopes, shady slopes, semi-shady slopes, and places with thick soil and a lot of grass are better. There is a simple and easy way to determine whether there is a lack of water: take eight ounces of soil from the mountain from a depth of about seven inches to one foot (more is okay), and weigh it again after drying it at home; if it is six ounces, it can be calculated that the water content is two ounces, which is 25%. It is known from the facts of many places that have failed that if seeds are sown on hillsides with less than 20% water content in the soil, most of them will die of drought in the spring; it is difficult for seedlings to emerge and survive in places with less than 10% water content. Second, "seize the soil." Covering the soil too thinly, too thickly, or having deep pits with loose soil will not easily preserve the seedlings. The thickness of the soil cover should be equivalent to two to four times the maximum diameter of the seed, shallower when the soil is wet and deeper when it is dry. In places with a lot of grass and dense shrubs, it is necessary to cut off the dense roots of the grass and trees to prevent the tree species from being invaded and killed. Third, "seize the light." When the light is too strong, the seedlings will be scorched to death, and when it is too weak (such as when the grass and trees are too dense), the seedlings will be stunted to death. Therefore, it is necessary to plant shade plants in places without grass; in places with less grass, the grass can be used for shade. Fourth, "seize the time." It is best after autumn, or before spring, and it is also possible to sow the seeds during the continuous rainy days in "Fu" days, and the seeds should be sown in time. Large seeds will not germinate if they are too dry, and small seeds will only be able to germinate if they are released.

    Leading Cadres of the Genghis Khan Grain Depot
    Do Not Pay Attention to Grain Storage Work
    Zhou Wenxun writes: The leading cadres of the Genghis Khan Grain Depot in Huna League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, do not pay attention to grain storage work, resulting in a large number of grains deteriorating and becoming moldy. During the Spring Festival, the leading cadres of the depot insisted that the employees participate in the performance of dramas, and arranged for Zhu Deming, the head of the storage and transportation section, to play a major role. Therefore, the employees had to rehearse the dramas at night, and doze off or memorize the scripts during the day, and few people cared about the grain storage work. Zhu Deming, the head of the storage and transportation section, even memorized the scripts every day when he went to the district grain bureau for meetings, for fear of delaying the performance. When some employees asked him what the content of the meeting was when he returned from the meeting in the district, he said: "I didn't pay attention to the meeting, I was memorizing the scripts every day!" At this time, some workers found that the grain in the warehouse was damp and told Zhu Deming that it must be dealt with quickly, but Zhu Deming ignored it. It was not until the Huna League investigation team went to check in mid-March this year that they found that the grain was damp and hot, and the grain depot only then dealt with it. It was found that more than 1,700 jin of grain was completely moldy and inedible, and more than 3,700 jin was damp and expanded. More seriously, when it was discovered that the grain had deteriorated and become moldy, the manager of the grain depot even said: "There is no way to fix the damaged grain, punish me however you want!"

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    领导农业生产的干部
    应该学习农业科学技术
    松江县农林科黄德裕来信：最近中共江苏省松江县委召开了一次会议，研究一九五三年增产计划。当大家热烈讨论怎样推广“小株方形密植”的先进经验时，县委书记郭玉汉同志问漕泾区区委书记张书铭同志：“什么叫小株方形密植？”张书铭同志回答不出来，其他不少搞农村工作的负责同志也回答不清楚。在另一次会议上，郭玉汉同志又让县农林科长吴美玉同志回答这个问题，吴美玉同志竟也说不知道。这实在是一个值得注意的问题。水稻的“小株方形密植”就是本县劳动模范陈永康的先进经验，并且已经被全国好多地方证明是合乎科学原理的。我们的区委书记和农林科长以及不少搞农村工作的干部竟不懂得，他们将怎样去推广呢？出现这种情况的原因：主要是这些同志没有认识学习“技术”对领导农业生产的意义，就对农业生产技术不加注意。很显然，不懂得技术，就不能很好领导生产。建议每一个领导农业生产的干部，都应该很好学习农业科学技术。中共磁县县委书记冯迎祥
    深入田间检查春耕保墒工作
    读者王大田、王廷玉、张有余来信：三月二十日中共河北省磁县县委书记冯迎祥同志前往一区曲沟、大营等村，深入检查群众春耕保墒工作。他亲自到地里检查墒土。他在大营村西岗坡上检查之后，发现有四十多块地（约一百二十余亩）大部分是去年犁过的，至今尚未耙耢，墒土已跑了二、三指，这样继续下去，势必影响播种工作。冯迎祥同志趁着该区召开村干部会议的机会，立刻动员区、村干部重视这个问题，并深入教育群众做好春耕保墒工作。县区领导干部深入群众检查生产，确是领导生产的一个重要方法。福建省农林厅副厅长等
    下
    乡宣传先进农业生产经验
    读者林启荣来信：三月九日，福建省农林厅副厅长和闽侯专署建设科科长（按：来信都未写明姓名）带同干部十余人到闽侯县四区扈屿镇了解春耕生产情况，并推广先进农业生产技术。他们抽出三个晚上，对全镇互助组长、生产委员及其它干部等进行技术训练，介绍许多先进农业技术。三月二十四日晚上，该村上演宣传婚姻法的短剧后，他们又把深耕多耙、选好种、合式秧田、稀播种、防治螟虫、小株密植、分期合理施肥、浅水灌溉等先进生产经验编成快板演出，使全场三千多个看戏群众受到了先进农业技术的宣传教育。
    目前春耕生产是农村压倒一切的中心任务。负责干部亲自下乡重点了解春耕情况，利用一切可能的机会，进行先进农业技术的宣传教育，对于鼓舞群众增产信心是有很大作用的。
    赵家屯农民修起了灌溉渠
    读者卢天鸿来信：广西灵川县八区河沙乡赵家屯最近修起一条五里长的灌溉渠。修起这条渠，真是好不容易啊！
    赵家屯和伍家村同在搭门大碑这块地方。多少年以前，赵家屯的农民就想在这里修渠。但伍家村地主伍邦彦是个当权派，他霸住这块地方硬不让修。两村闹了多少纠纷，但旧社会“理”是地主的。赵家屯农民修不起渠，只得平均每年凑一万斤谷子修制水车，还只能抢救一部分田的禾苗。好长的年月，赵家屯农民丢了多少谷子呀！
    一九四九年当地解放了。一九五○年春，人民政府号召农民兴修水利。赵家屯的农民，马上提出要修渠，县人民政府也批准了。但当时还没土地改革，地主伍邦彦就挑拨伍家村的农民来阻止。两村又起了纠纷。县人民政府了解了伍邦彦的罪恶，就把他逮捕了；但修渠的事终因两村起纠纷而搁下了。
    经过土地改革和各种政治运动，农民觉悟提高了。他们认识到要提高生产，就得兴修水利。今年一月底，伍营、河沙、北塘三乡成立了兴修水利委员会，共同兴修对三乡都有很大好处的搭门大碑的水利。当地农民好高兴啊！
    单讲赵家屯这条支渠，农民一盘算，修渠材料费只要过去一年修制水车的谷就行了；渠修好后，全村一千二百多亩田只有二百多亩不能受益。全村群众大会决定：自由出工、不讲强迫，每工付工资七斤谷；受益田每亩出十斤谷。人民政府还贷下二百五十万元水利贷款。二月二十一日动工了，全村一百零七户，每天平均有一百五十多人出工；不管天晴下雨，大家都努力干。原定十三天的工程，十天就完成了。弯弯的渠道水慢慢流，给赵家屯农民添上了不少快乐，他们的生产热情更高了。永年县北刘固村和姚村农民
    植造防风林提高了农业生产
    读者赵铭杰来信：河北永年县五区北刘固村和姚村距沙河很近，过去每到春季风沙就埋没田苗，沿河农民受到很大损失。一九五○年到一九五二年间，北刘固村和姚村的农民植造了防风林五顷七十亩，现在已长成了黑压压的小树林了。沿河的土地得到森林的保护，都能丰收了。像姚村赵来鎻的沿河七亩地，在未造林前总是光见播种不见苗；自从造林以后，一九五一年种的花生每亩产二十四斤，去年种棉花共收一千零三十斤。因此，沿河农民造林热情很高。去年冬季该两村农民又造了两顷四十五亩防风林，今年又植了三万八千棵大白杨。两村农民为了保护防风林带，还共同议订护林公约；在两村男女老幼的保护下，所有树木一棵棵都保护得很好。希望有风沙灾害地区的农村向北刘固村和姚村看齐。
    江华县八区瑶族妇女
    积极参加造林工作
    湘南区民主妇女联合会李志英来信：湘南江华县八区瑶族妇女积极参加造林工作。一九五二年冬季造林运动中，樟木乡坪冲沅村瑶族妇女盘满妹和该村妇女群众二十人共植苗一千五百株，播种一万多株。该乡郑友妹每天忙着家务，还植树一千五百株，并且带动群众十八人植树和播树种共四万株。今年春季造林运动中，庙子乡婆婆湾瑶族人民代表冯崇坤的六十四岁祖母冯李英，每天大清早起来就光着脚去采集树种，农历正月二十四那一天，她就采集了六百多株杉树苗。她说：“人老，脑壳（指思想）没有老。我记得毛主席，我要响应他老人家的号召，加劲造林，为后代子孙谋幸福。”她这种行动带动了庙子乡不少群众参加造林工作。
    据不完全统计，江华县八区在春季造林工作中已种杉树一百十一万余株，松树约三十万株，果树六百八十五株，栎树四千多株，酸枣树四百四十株，竹子四千五百多株。十三个乡参加造林的瑶族妇女共一千三百九十二人。
    在杨柳插木和荒山播种中
    应该注意的几个问题
    中国科学院研究员郝景盛、华北行政委员会林业处处长王金茂、山西省农业厅林业局副局长于霖瑞来信：我们在山西农村发现有些地方杨柳插木和荒山播种的技术有问题，这样会使所插柳干和所播树种不能成活。这是一个大问题，需要及时解决，不然将使春季造林工作遭到更大的损失。现在我们把发现的情况和我们的意见告诉你们，希望引起当地和有类似情况地区的农林部门注意。
    在杨柳插木方面，有四个问题需要注意：（一）有些地方插干太稀，这样柳干就会长不高，长不快，长不直，长不成材。应该每隔二三尺远插一株，相隔再远就不好了。第二，有些地方所用柳干太长。四尺以上的柳干不易生芽，不易生根，且地下水分不易达到枝叶，故不易成活。应该用一尺半到二尺长的栽子，外露一二寸，地下埋一尺多，成活后再留一根粗壮枝条长成树。第三，埋得太浅，有些地方的柳干地下仅埋半尺深，这不成。要多埋，宁深勿浅。第四，杨柳插木时间太晚，现在有些地方杨柳已开花，再栽杨柳就不易活。宜在雨季头伏、二伏或秋后抓住季节栽植。
    在荒山播种方面，有以下四个问题需要注意：第
    一，“抓水”。天干、地干处所，尤其西南向山坡及南向山坡不可播种；北坡、荫坡、半荫坡、土厚多草地方比较好些。断定缺水不缺水有个简单易行的好办法：把山上的土由深约七寸到一尺处取出八两（可多不可少），到家晒干后再秤一下；如是六两，可以算出含水量是二两，即百分之二十五。由很多地方失败事实推知，凡在土中含水不足百分之二十的山坡播种，春季多半被旱死；在含水百分之十以下的地方，出苗也难成活。第二，“抓土”。覆土太薄、太厚或坑深土松，都不易保苗。覆土厚度宜相当于种子最大直径的二倍到四倍，土湿时浅些，干时深些。草多灌木丛生之地，需切断草木密根，以免树种遭侵死。第三，“抓光”。光太强时树苗会被晒死，太弱（如草木太密时）时树苗会被蹩死，故无草之地需种遮荫植物；草少之地可利用草丛庇荫。第四，“抓时”。秋后最好，春前也好，伏天连阴雨也可以，种子要及时下种。大粒种过干不发芽，小粒种只放不出苗。
    成吉思汗粮栈领导干部
    不重视粮食保管工作
    周文勋来信：内蒙古自治区呼纳盟成吉思汗粮栈领导干部不重视粮食保管工作，致使大批粮食变质、霉烂。春节时，该栈领导干部硬要职工们参加演剧，并把储运股长朱德明排成主要角色。因此，职工们晚上要排剧，白天就打盹或背戏文，对粮食保管工作很少人过问。储运股股长朱德明，甚至到区粮食局开会时每天还背剧本，恐怕耽误了演出。他由区里开会回来，有的职工问他开会的内容怎样时，他却说：“我那注意开会，每天在背剧本啦！”正在这时，有的工人发现仓库粮食发潮，告诉朱德明必须赶快处理，但朱德明却不理睬。直到今年三月中旬呼纳盟清查组去检查时，发现粮食受潮发热，粮栈才作了处理。计检查出完全霉坏不能食用的粮食有一千七百多斤，受潮膨胀的有三千七百多斤。更严重的是，当发现粮食变质、霉烂后，该粮栈经理还说：“粮食坏了也没办法，愿意怎么处分就怎么处分呗！”
