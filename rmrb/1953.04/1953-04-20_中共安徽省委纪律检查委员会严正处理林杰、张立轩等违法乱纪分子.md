Since this newspaper successively exposed the three cases of Lin Jie, the Propaganda Minister of the Wuhu Prefectural Committee of the CCP in Anhui, seriously resisting criticism and scolding the Party newspaper, Jia Xinkui, a farmer from Shou County, Anhui, being forced to commit suicide due to the obstruction of bureaucratic officials at all levels after reporting illegal elements, and Zhang Lixuan, the Director of the Bengbu Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, illegally forcing marriage and framing cadre Xue Zuyun, on February 1st, February 2nd, and February 8th, it has received more than 40 letters from readers and volunteer soldiers from various places. These letters unanimously expressed the request to give strict punishments to illegal and discipline-violating elements such as Lin Jie and Zhang Lixuan. The Anhui Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection of the CCP and the Provincial Government's Judicial Supervision organs have conducted in-depth investigations and studies on these three cases, repeatedly verifying them. Now the details of the cases have been completely clarified, and the relevant illegal and discipline-violating elements and derelict personnel have been dealt with accordingly. A summary of the handling situation is as follows:

I. The Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection has made a decision to expel the anti-Party element Lin Jie from the Party. The decision pointed out that Lin Jie had committed a series of extremely serious errors. In July 1950, the former Wanbei Daily had exposed and criticized Lin Jie for playing with women and beating his wife. At that time, Lin Jie, as the Second Secretary of the Lu'an County Party Committee, not only refused to make a review of this criticism but instead hated the Party newspaper and repeatedly scolded the Party newspaper, saying, "Wanbei Daily is a Kuomintang newspaper." Lin Jie believed that the Party newspaper's criticism of him was "attacking" his "prestige." Therefore, he did not "take a warm welcome attitude" to the criticism from the masses in accordance with the central instructions, but instead adopted an attitude of resisting criticism and suppressing criticism. Last year, during the "Three-Anti" campaign, Lin Jie quarreled with Comrade Zhang Yun, the Minister of People's Armed Forces of Wuwei County, at a meeting. After the meeting, when other comrades suggested that he ask the prefectural committee to send someone to deal with it, Lin Jie scolded the prefectural committee, saying, "No matter which bastard the prefectural committee sends to deal with it, they must follow my opinion, otherwise it won't work." When Lin Jie served as the Secretary of the Wuwei County Party Committee, he often scolded cadres. Once, Lin Jie called Comrade He Jizhou (clerk of the County Committee Secretariat), and when He did not hear him, Lin immediately scolded him, causing Comrade He Jizhou to cry. In August 1951, Lin Jie and other comrades went to the prefectural committee for a meeting. The boat was very crowded. When the head of a processing section of the prefectural administration's grain bureau touched him while boarding the boat, he became furious and ordered his guards to illegally detain the section chief. In 1952, when Lin Jie led the "Three-Anti" movement in Wuwei County, because Youth League member Liu Lanbo had criticized him for taking valuable tonics from the county hospital at will, he harbored resentment. Later, he even used the excuse that Liu was in love with a female comrade to order him to make a review at the Youth League group meeting and arbitrarily suspended Liu's Youth League membership for three months.

The above facts prove that Lin Jie's character and style are extremely bad and his mistakes are very serious. He has become an incurable anti-Party element. In order to maintain Party discipline and purify the Party organization, the Anhui Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection of the CCP has decided, and with the approval of the East China Bureau for Discipline Inspection of the CCP Central Committee, to expel Lin Jie from the Party.

II. Zhang Lixuan, Yang Zhenzhong, and Zhu Kang, the illegal and discipline-violating elements who framed Xue Zuyun, have been expelled from the Party. The case of Zhang Lixuan, the former Director of the Bengbu Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Yang Zhenzhong, the Chief of the Commercial Section (and Security Committee member of the Branch), and Zhu Kang, the Chief of the Industrial Section (and Secretary of the Branch), framing Xue Zuyun (Youth League member), an accountant of the bureau, in April 1951 (detailed in this newspaper on February 2nd), has been fully confirmed after more than four months of investigation by the Anhui Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection. Zhang Lixuan, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhu Kang, and others, for shameful personal purposes, used their powers to deceive superiors and suppress subordinates, and took the opportunity to retaliate by framing Xue Zuyun with "political issues" in April 1951, and arresting and detaining him for a year and two months. After this case was exposed, the Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection immediately sent people to investigate. During the inspection, Zhang Lixuan, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhu Kang, and others still avoided the important and took the light, resisted inspection, and shirked responsibility. They also used their administrative, branch, and security work powers to retaliate against Xue Zuyun. This kind of anti-Party and anti-people criminal act of violating human rights, violating laws, and violating discipline is very serious and very bad. In order to maintain Party discipline, purify the Party organization, and educate all Party members, the Anhui Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection has decided to give Zhang Lixuan, Yang Zhenzhong, and Zhu Kang the punishment of expulsion from the Party. Tang Yixi, the former Secretary of the Bengbu Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce Party Branch, and Liu Donger, the Secretary of the Youth League Branch, who were derelict in their duties related to this case, were given the punishment of removal from their positions within the Party.

III. Handling of the case of Jia Xinkui, a farmer from Shou County, being forced to commit suicide due to the obstruction of bureaucratic officials after reporting bad people and bad deeds. Jia Xinkui, a liberated farmer from Daying Village, Yaogao Township, Sanhe District, Shou County, Anhui, ran to fifteen organs and traveled more than 7,000 li back and forth for a year because he reported the illegal and discipline-violating behavior of village cadres Shen Hongjie and Yao Ruxue. However, because he was obstructed by bureaucratic officials at all levels, the problem had not been resolved. Finally, under the sarcasm, attacks, and threats of the reported persons, he was forced to commit suicide (detailed in this newspaper on February 8th). This incident proves that the People's Court of Shou County and other organs have serious bureaucratic work styles that disregard people's accusations, disregard people's lives, and listen to and believe in cadres one-sidedly. It also proves that these organs have a serious lack of organization and discipline in not paying attention to the instructions of superiors, failing to implement them, or not implementing them at all. Now, the Anhui Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection of the CCP and the Provincial Government's Judicial Supervision organs have taken the following actions against the personnel involved in this incident:

(1) Shen Hongjie, the militia squad leader of Daying Village, was greedy and violated the law. After being reported, he dared to retaliate against the reporter and threatened Jia Xinkui to death. He should bear the main responsibility for this incident and has been decided to be arrested and prosecuted.

(2) Yao Ruxue, the administrative team leader of Daying Village, harbored landlords, lost his position, and retaliated against the reporter. It has been decided to expel him from the Party.

(3) Shen Songjiang, the Secretary of the Yaogao Township Branch, failed to implement the instructions of his superiors and seriously handle Jia's accusations. He listened to the one-sided opinions of the accused and ignored Jia's accusations, causing serious consequences. It has been decided to expel him from the Party.

(4) Liu Mengping, the Civil Affairs Administrator of Sanhe District, suppressed democracy and unreasonably accused the reporter. When he was responsible for handling Jia's accusations in Yaogao Township, he did not conduct an in-depth investigation and issued a summons casually, allowing Shen Hongjie to threaten Jia Xinkui under the pretext of the summons. He should bear the main responsibility for Jia's suicide incident and has been decided to be removed from his post and prosecuted.

(5) Ye Mengmei, the former Vice President of the Shou County People's Court, had a serious bureaucratic work style and was consistently irresponsible in her work. When Jia Xinkui first filed a complaint with the court, the court refused to accept it on the "grounds" that he "did not have a letter of introduction from the district and township government." When the instructions of the Supreme People's Court were handed over to the County People's Court for handling, Jia came to the court again, but Ye only cared about playing Kang Le ball and still ignored him. This bad work style has caused great losses to the work and has been decided to be expelled from the Party, removed from his post, and investigated.

    中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会严正处理林杰、张立轩等违法乱纪分子
    本报自二月一日、二月二日和二月八日，连续揭发了安徽中共芜湖地委宣传部长林杰严重抗拒批评辱骂党报、安徽寿县农民贾新奎因检举违法分子，遭官僚主义者层层阻碍而被迫自杀和蚌埠市工商局长张立轩非法逼婚陷害干部薛祖云三个案件以后，曾先后接到各地读者和志愿军战士的来信四十多件，这些来信一致表示，要求给予林杰、张立轩等违法乱纪分子以严格处分。中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会和省府司法监察机关，对此三案，曾进行了深入的调查研究，反复对证，现在案情已全部弄清，并对有关的违法乱纪分子和失职人员，分别进行了处理。处理情况摘要如下：
    一、省委纪律检查委员会已作出关于开除反党分子林杰的党籍的决定，决定中指出，林杰曾犯了一系列的极严重的错误。一九五○年七月，前皖北日报曾揭发和批评林杰玩弄女性、打骂妻子的错误，当时林杰身为六安县委第二书记，不仅对这个批评拒不检讨，反而因此仇视党报，一再辱骂党报。说：“皖北日报是国民党报纸。”林杰认为党报对他的批评是“打击”他的“威信”，因此他对来自群众的批评非但不遵照中央指示“采取热烈欢迎的态度”，相反地却采取了抗拒批评、压制批评的态度。去年在“三反”期间，林杰与无为县人民武装部长张云同志在会议上争吵，会后，当别的同志建议他请地委派人来处理时，林杰竟骂地委说：“不管地委派那个王八蛋来处理，都得依我的意见，不然就不行。”林杰在任职无为县委书记时，常破口大骂干部。有一次林杰喊何济舟同志（县委会秘书室干事），何没有听见，林即破口大骂，骂得何济舟同志大哭。一九五一年八月，林杰和其他同志们去地委开会，船上很挤，专署粮食局有一加工科科长在上船时碰了他一下，他就大发脾气，并令其警卫员把这个科长非法看管起来。一九五二年林杰在无为县领导“三反”运动时，因为青年团员刘澜波同志曾对他随便在县卫生院拿贵重补品提出批评，他怀恨在心，后来竟然借口刘与某女同志谈恋爱令其在团小组会上检讨，并擅自停止刘三个月团籍。
    上述事实证明：林杰的品质与作风极为恶劣，错误非常严重，已成为不可救药的反党分子。为了维护党的纪律，纯洁党的组织，中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会决定并经中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会批准，开除林杰的党籍。
    二、陷害薛祖云的违法乱纪分子张立轩、杨振中、朱抗三人已被开除党籍。蚌埠市人民政府前工商局局长张立轩、商业科科长（支部保卫委员）杨振中、工业科科长（支部书记）朱抗等人，于一九五一年四月，陷害该局会计薛祖云（青年团员）一案（详见二月二日本报），经安徽省委纪律检查委员会四个多月调查，已完全证实。张立轩、杨振中、朱抗等人，为了可耻的个人目的，竟然利用职权，欺上压下，借端报复，于一九五一年四月间，以“政治问题”陷害薛祖云，并将其逮捕，关押达一年零两个月之久。此案被揭发后，省委纪律检查委员会即派人进行调查，在检查期间，张立轩、杨振中、朱抗等仍然避重就轻，抗拒检查，推卸责任。并利用行政、支部、和保卫工作的职权，向薛祖云进行报复陷害。这种侵犯人权、违法乱纪的反党反人民的罪恶行为，是十分严重，十分恶劣的。为了维护党的纪律，纯洁党的组织，教育全体党员，安徽省委纪律检查委员会已决定予张立轩、杨振中、朱抗三人以开除党籍的处分。并对与本案有关的前蚌埠市工商局党支部书记唐颐谿，团支部书记柳东二失职人员，分别给予党内撤销工作的处分。
    三、关于寿县农民贾新奎因检举坏人坏事，遭受官僚主义者重重阻碍被迫自杀一案的处理情况。安徽寿县三和区姚皋乡大郢村翻身农民贾新奎，因为检举村干部沈宏杰、姚如学的违法乱纪行为，先后跑了十五个机关，往返七千余里，历时一年，但因受到层层官僚主义者的阻挠，问题一直未得到解决，最后在被检举人的讽刺、打击和威胁下，终于被逼自杀（详见二月八日本报）。这一事件证明安徽寿县人民法院等机关，存在着严重的漠视人民控告，漠视人民生命，对干部偏听偏信的官僚主义作风，同时也证明了这些机关存在着对上级的指示极不重视，执行不力或根本不执行的严重无组织无纪律现象。现在中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会和省府司法监察机关，已对与此事件有关的人员进行了如下的处理：
    （一）大郢村民兵班长沈宏杰贪污违法，经检举后，竟敢打击报复检举人，威胁逼死贾新奎，对这一事件应负主要责任，已决定逮捕法办。
    （二）大郢村行政组长姚如学，包庇地主，丧失立场，打击报复检举人，决定予以开除党籍的处分。
    （三）姚皋乡支部书记沈颂江，不执行上级指示，认真处理贾的控告，偏听被检举人片面意见，不理睬贾的控告，造成严重后果，已决定开除其党籍。
    （四）三和区民政管理员刘孟平，压制民主，无理指责检举人。负责到姚皋乡处理贾的控告时，不深入调查，竟随便发传票，使沈宏杰得以假借传票威胁贾新奎。对贾自杀事件，应负主要责任，已决定撤职法办。
    （五）寿县人民法院前副院长叶梦梅，存在着严重的官僚主义作风，一贯工作不负责任，当贾新奎第一次控告到该院时，该院竟以“没有区乡政府介绍信”为“理由”，拒不受理。当最高人民法院的指示交县人民法院办理时，贾又来该院，叶只顾打康乐球，仍置之不理。这种恶劣作风，使工作受到很大损失，已决定开除党籍，撤职查办。
