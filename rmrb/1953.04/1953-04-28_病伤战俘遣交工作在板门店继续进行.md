Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 27th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation of China and Korea issued the following communique on April 27th:

　　On April 27th, the other side repatriated 499 sick and wounded captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side at Panmunjom.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 27th: On the 27th, the U.S. side temporarily notified us for the third time that the number of people to be repatriated on this day would be reduced by one. Therefore, the actual number of sick and wounded captured personnel of the People's Army repatriated on the 27th was 499. According to the prior notification from the U.S. side, there were no patients needing stretchers today, but several people could not move at all and were carried down from the U.S. ambulances and onto our ambulances by staff. Among the captured personnel repatriated today, there were also 50 mental patients.

　　The returning wounded and sick continued to vividly demonstrate the determination of our captured personnel to return to their motherland. As soon as many people got out of the U.S. vehicles, they took out the national flags they had made in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps at the risk of their lives. Wiping away tears of joy and sorrow, they waved the flags and shouted slogans, singing "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and "The People's Army March." Under the kind care of our receiving personnel, they quickly boarded ambulances and drove towards the welcoming crowd of citizens waiting for them in Kaesong.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 27th: The Korean Central News Agency reported on the lives of the sick and wounded captured personnel of the Korean People's Army living in the Third Hospital in Kaesong after being repatriated, saying: "In the morning, the soft sunlight shone on the glass windows of the hospital, and the wounded and sick soldiers of the People's Army who had returned to their motherland got out of bed. At this time, light and pleasant music came from the loudspeakers. Some nurses helped the wounded and sick to wash their faces; other nurses opened the windows to let in fresh air and made the beds of the wounded and sick. After checking their temperatures, the wounded and sick went to eat breakfast, eating according to their individual health needs and appetite. After the doctors had administered the day's treatment, actors from the National Art Theater and the People's Army Art Troupe, who had specially come to Kaesong to express their condolences, gave them a performance to express their sympathy.

　　The doctors and nurses in the hospital all said that it was too difficult to get the wounded and sick to take a good nap. This is because, although they were lying in bed, they always had newspapers and magazines in their hands. Every piece of news about the victories in the front and rear of the motherland published in the newspapers and magazines made them feel happy and encouraged. After the wounded and sick had taken a nap, the nurses accompanied them for walks inside and outside the hospital, went to the small park next to the hospital for cultural and recreational activities, or went to the library to read newspapers and books. In the evening, the wounded and sick slept peacefully, and the nurses and health workers took care of them all night.

　　Several people's delegations composed of representatives from all walks of life in Kaesong City, Kaepung County, and Panmun County (newly established county) and representatives of families of the People's Army have visited the Third Hospital and other hospitals in succession since April 21st to express their warm condolences to the wounded and sick. The farmers' band organized by the farmers of Panmun County and the literary and art groups of various schools also went to the hospital to perform condolences. The representatives also brought a large number of beautiful flowers of various kinds that were blooming in the mountains and fields of Korea to offer to the wounded and sick. The representatives and the families of the People's Army told the wounded and sick about the efforts and victories of the people in the rear, which made them feel extremely happy and encouraged."

    病伤战俘遣交工作在板门店继续进行
    【新华社开城二十七日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月二十七日发表公报如下：
    四月二十七日对方在板门店遣交给我方朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员四百九十九人。
    【新华社开城二十七日电】二十七日美方第三次临时通知在这一天应遣返的人数中减少一人，因而二十七日实际被遣返的是人民军病伤被俘人员四百九十九人。按照美方事先的通知，今天没有需用担架的病人，但却有好几个人根本不能行动，是由工作人员把他们背下美方救护车和背上我方救护车的。在今天被遣返的被俘人员中又有五十名精神病患者。
    归来的伤病员继续生动地表现出我方被俘人员要求重返祖国的决心。许多人一下美方车辆，就拿出他们冒着生命危险在美方战俘营中做的国旗。他们一面揩拭悲喜交集的眼泪，挥动着一面旗子，呼着口号。唱着“金日成将军之歌”和“人民军进行曲”。在我方接收人员的亲切照顾下，他们迅速地乘上救护车驶向在开城等待着他们的市民的欢迎行列。
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜中央通讯社报道被遣返后住在开城第三号病院里的朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员的生活说：早晨，柔和的阳光照到了病院的玻璃窗上，返回祖国的人民军伤病员们从床上起来了。这时，从扩音器中传出了轻松愉快的音乐。有的护士们扶着伤病员们去洗脸；有的护士们打开窗户，让新鲜的空气进来，并把伤病员们的床铺整理好。在检查体温以后，伤病员们去吃早饭，按每个人的健康需要和饭量进食。在医生对他们施行了当天的治疗以后，特别赶到开城慰问他们的国立艺术剧场和人民军艺术团的演员们就给他们作慰问演出。
    病院里的医生和护士们都说，要伤病员们好好睡午觉，真是太困难了。因为他们虽然在床上躺着，但手里总放不下书报杂志。书报杂志上刊载的祖国前后方的每一个胜利消息都使他们感到高兴和鼓舞。在伤病员们睡过午觉之后，护士们便陪着他们在院内院外散步，上病院旁边的小公园里去作文化娱乐活动，或者去图书室看书报。晚上，伤病员们安静地睡着好觉，护士和卫生员们整夜看护着他们。
    开城市、开丰郡和板门郡（新设郡）各界人民的代表和人民军家属的代表所组成的几个人民代表团，从四月二十一日起接连访问了第三号病院和其他各病院，向伤病员们表示热情的慰问。板门郡的农民们组织的农民乐队和各学校的文艺小组，也到病院进行了慰问表演。代表们并携带大批正在朝鲜的山野里盛开的各种美丽的鲜花献给伤病员们。代表们和人民军家属们对伤病员讲述了后方人民的努力和胜利，使他们感到极大的欢欣和鼓舞。
