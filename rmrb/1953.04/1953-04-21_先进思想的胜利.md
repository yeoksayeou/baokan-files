The news that the nation was embarking on large-scale economic construction reached the employees of the Shenyang State-Owned Machine Tool Plant No. 1, and everyone was filled with joy and excitement. They all said, "Large-scale economic construction means building our country into an industrialized nation. The Soviet Union was able to complete its five-year plan in four years. This time, we must work even harder to learn from the advanced experiences of our elder brother, and also complete the national production plan ahead of schedule!" However, Wang Wenshan, the director of the Second Workshop, a worker-cadre who had always been a positive leader in previous production competitions and had been repeatedly named an industrial labor model in Shenyang, was troubled by an unpleasant matter despite his excitement.

The unpleasant matter was the conservative production plan proposed by the factory director to the higher-level leading authorities. Comrade Wang Hongwen, the factory director, had achieved success in transitioning Factory No. 1 from chaotic management to planned management, but he lacked sensitivity to the factory's rapidly developing production and had no clear understanding of the factory's potential, nor did he believe in the workers' wisdom and strength. When formulating this year's production plan, he neither deeply mobilized the masses for discussion nor discussed it with the Party General Branch Committee. Instead, he sent the plan, which was formulated by several section chiefs based on old production indicators, to the higher-level leading authorities. This plan was extremely conservative. For example, the labor-hour quota for the main product to be produced from the second quarter onwards—the Soviet-style 1Д63 lathe—was 7,121 actual working hours during last year's trial production, but this year's plan still set it at over 7,000 hours. According to the production efficiency calculated based on this backward plan, the cost of producing the 1Д63 lathe this year would be about the same as during last year's trial production. Not only would it fail to accumulate wealth for the country, but, on the contrary, because workers' wages and welfare funds had increased this year, the state would have to compensate more than 700 million yuan. Wang Wenshan was very dissatisfied with this plan, which workers called a "strange plan." He thought: Although the actual working hours for last year's trial production of the 1Д63 lathe were 7,121 hours, interrupted working hours accounted for 501.6 hours, defective-product working hours accounted for 204.45 hours, and intermittent working hours accounted for 427.78 hours. This year, with mass production, the supply of tools, fixtures, and raw materials would definitely be timely, and, after summarizing last year's trial production experience, the workers' technical skills and proficiency would continuously improve, and defective-product and intermittent working hours would be greatly reduced. Taking the Second Workshop as an example, it took 1,700 hours to process a lathe component during trial production. According to the actual situation in the workshop, this year only 1,000 hours would be enough. Why not formulate an advanced plan based on this year's actual situation? This question had been bothering Wang Wenshan.

One day at noon, Wang Wenshan went to the office of the Party General Branch Committee. Comrade Bi Keyi, the secretary of the General Branch, greeted him and asked, "Comrade Wang Wenshan, will your workshop be able to complete the plan to process 280 lathe components this year?" Wang Wenshan replied without hesitation, "No problem, we will increase it by another 100 units!" He then told Secretary Bi all the opinions he had been holding back. Secretary Bi agreed with his opinions and expressed support for him in formulating an advanced plan.

The next day, with the help of the workshop's Party branch, the trade union, and the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee's work team, Wang Wenshan launched a survey of the entire workshop's production capacity and summarized the workshop's production experience over the past few years, analyzing in detail the favorable conditions for future production. According to the survey results and the tips found by the workshop, the equipment utilization rate this year could be increased by 85%, and the defect rate could be reduced by 4%. At the same time, through the "Three-Anti" and increase production and practice economy movements, the political consciousness of the employees had been unprecedentedly raised. In 1952, the workshop had 20 Party members and 50 Youth League members, while this year the number of Party members had increased to 61 and the number of Youth League members to 150. These backbone forces were a powerful guarantee for completing and overfulfilling this year's national plan. Also, changing from machine tool piece-rate to individual piece-rate would increase production efficiency by 30%; changing the original daily production records to hourly records would increase it by another 20%. This year, with the strengthening of department work, the supply of raw materials, tools, and fixtures would definitely be timely. Technicians going down to the workshops would greatly help improve workers' technical skills and solve key production problems. If these favorable conditions were fully utilized, increasing the plan by another 100 lathe components would be entirely possible. Wang Wenshan's thorough and meticulous analysis immediately received the support of all the employees in the workshop. They unanimously approved the plan proposed by Wang Wenshan.

The Second Workshop's advanced plan to increase the processing of lathe components by another 100 units was well-founded. However, when Wang Wenshan submitted this advanced plan to the factory management, it was suppressed by the conservative thinking of the factory director, the production section chief, and others. At a cadre meeting, they criticized Wang Wenshan's plan as an "adventurous plan" and a "baseless plan." Factory Director Wang Hongwen did not investigate the reasons for not completing the plan last year, but believed that "Since the plan was not completed last year, this year's plan cannot be higher than last year's, otherwise it would be 'adventurous'."

In order to refute Wang Wenshan's advanced plan, the conservatives sent personnel from the production section and planning section to the Second Workshop for a "survey." During the survey, they did not see the favorable conditions and advanced work sections of the Second Workshop, but only focused on the two weak links in the first and third work sections—the large lead screw and the headstock—and used the weak links as the basis for criticizing Wang Wenshan's plan as "not realistic" and "tending to be greedy and rash." Wang Wenshan raised objections to them at the time, pointing out that the backward work sections should be made to learn from the advanced work sections, and not the other way around. However, Wang Wenshan had new concerns at this time. He thought: What if the factory's supply of raw materials and tools and fixtures is not timely, and interrupted working hours and waiting for materials occur later? Therefore, he did not persist in the struggle at that time. People headed by Factory Director Wang Hongwen took the opportunity to use the results of their "survey" as the basis for passing a conservative plan that only increased production by seventeen units.

Wang Wenshan was very distressed. He thought that the country had begun large-scale economic construction, and a backward plan must not be made just because there are two backward work sections in the workshop. At this time, the secretary of the Party General Branch encouraged him again, hoping that he would show the spirit that a Communist Party member should have and persist in the struggle. With the support of the workshop Party branch and the municipal Party committee work team, and with the specific help of the technical personnel in the construction room, Wang Wenshan re-mobilized the masses to discuss the plan. This time, with the help of the technical personnel, the two weak links in the first and third work sections were broken through, shortening the labor-hour quota for manufacturing large lead screws from 80 hours to 18 hours; shortening the manufacturing of headstocks from 70 hours to 35 hours. The confidence of all the employees in the workshop was even higher, and they decided to increase the original increase of 100 units by another 20 units, and solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait; guaranteeing the completion of the task. However, when the factory management committee discussed this plan, the production section chief still said: "At most, we can increase by seventeen units, otherwise balanced production will not be achieved, who will be responsible?" At this time, no one paid attention to such stubborn conservative ideas as the production section chief's, and the Second Workshop's plan was unanimously approved by everyone.

The victory of Wang Wenshan's struggle against conservative ideas affected the entire factory. The Second Workshop increased its original plan to produce 280 lathe components to 387 units. This news encouraged the employees of other workshops. The First Workshop also changed its original plan to assemble 195 lathes to assemble 311 units. Therefore, Machine Tool Plant No. 1 is not going to cause the country to lose 700 million yuan this year, but to create more than 26 billion yuan of wealth for the country. Now, the production section chief and the planning section chief are all convinced, saying: "Next time, we can't just sit in the office and make production plans!" Factory Director Wang also made a self-criticism in front of all the employees of the factory. At present, the employees of Machine Tool Plant No. 1 are launching a high-speed cutting competition to welcome Red May and the Seventh National Labor Congress, and are actively and enthusiastically working to complete the advanced plan they have formulated.

    先进思想的胜利
    丛木生  李水相
    国家开始大规模经济建设的消息传到沈阳国营机械一厂以后，厂里的职工莫不欢腾鼓舞，都说：“大规模经济建设，就是要把祖国建设成工业化国家。苏联能四年完成五年计划，咱这回得更加努力学习老大哥的先进经验，也提前完成国家生产计划！”但是，第二车间主任王文山，这位在历次的生产竞赛中，总是积极带头，曾几度被评为沈阳市工业劳动模范的工人干部，在兴奋之余，却被一件不愉快的事情烦恼着。
    这件令人不愉快的事情，就是厂长向上级领导机关提出的那个保守的生产计划。厂长汪洪文同志，在把一厂从管理混乱转到计划管理这个工作中是有成绩的，但以后对工厂生产日新月异的发展却缺乏敏感，对本厂的潜力心中无数，不相信工人的智慧和力量。在制订今年的生产计划时，他既不深入发动群众讨论，也不经过党总支委员会讨论，就把由几个科长根据过去旧的生产指标制订的计划送到上级领导机关去了。这个计划十分保守。比如从第二季度就开始生产的主要产品——苏联式一Д六三车床的工时定额，在去年试制时，实动工时为七千一百二十一小时，今年的计划仍订为七千多小时。根据这个落后计划的生产效率计算，今年生产出来的一Д六三车床的成本，将与去年试制时的差不多。不但不能给国家积累财富，相反的，因为今年工人工资、福利基金增加了，国家还要赔上七亿多元。王文山很不满意这个被工人称为“奇怪的计划”的计划，他想：去年试制一Д六三车床的实动工时虽然是七千一百二十一小时，但其中中断工时占五百零一点六小时，废品工时占二百零四点四五小时，间断工时占四百二十七点七八小时；今年要大批生产，工具、卡具和原料的供应一定会及时，而且经过总结去年的试制经验，工人的技术水平和熟练程度将不断地提高，废品和间断工时将会大大缩减。就以第二车间来说吧，在试制时，加工一台车床部件需要一千七百小时，根据车间里的实际情况，今年只要一千小时就足够了。为什么不根据今年的实际情况订出一个先进的计划呢？这个问题一直烦恼着王文山。
    有一天中午，王文山到党总支委员会办公室去。总支书记毕可怡同志迎头就问他：“王文山同志，今年你们车间要完成二百八十台车床加工部件的计划，成吗？”王文山毫不犹豫地回答说：“没问题，我们还要多增加一百台呢！”他当时就把别在心里的意见统统向毕书记说了，毕书记同意他的意见，并表示支持他制订先进的计划。
    第二天，在车间党支部、工会和中共沈阳市委工作组的帮助下，王文山发动了全车间的生产能力查定，并总结了车间过去几年来的生产经验，详尽地分析出今后生产上的有利条件。根据查定的结果和车间找出的窍门计算，今年的设备运用率可以提高百分之八十五，废品率可以降低百分之四；同时，经过“三反”和增产节约运动，职工的政治觉悟已空前提高，一九五二年车间有党员二十人，团员五十人，而今年党员增加到六十一人，团员增加到一百五十人。这些骨干力量是完成和超额完成今年国家计划的有力保证。另如由机床计件改为个人计件，也将提高生产效率百分之三十；将原来的生产日纪录改为小时纪录，又将提高百分之二十；今年加强科室工作以后，原料和工具、卡具的供应一定会及时。技术人员下车间，对提高工人技术水平、解决车间生产关键问题，定会大有帮助。如果充分发挥这些有利条件，再增加一百台车床的计划是完全可能的。王文山这样周密细致的分析，马上得到了全车间职工的支持。他们一致通过了王文山提出的计划。
    第二车间再增加一百台车床加工部件的先进计划是有充分根据的。但当王文山把这个先进计划提到厂部时，却遭到了厂长、生产科长等保守思想的压抑。他们在一次干部会上，批评王文山的计划是
    “冒险计划”、“无根据的计划”。厂长汪洪文不研究去年没完成计划的原因，就认为：“既然去年没完成计划，今年的计划就不能比去年提高，否则就是‘冒险’”。
    保守主义者为了批驳王文山的先进计划，就派生产科和计划科的人员到第二车间去“查定”。查定时，他们没有看到二车间的有利条件和先进工段，只注意了一、三工段大丝杠和床头箱两个薄弱环节，并以薄弱环节为依据，批评王文山的计划“不切合实际”，“有贪大冒进的倾向”。王文山当时向他们提出反驳意见，指出应该让落后工段向先进工段看齐，而不该让先进工段向落后工段看齐。但是，这时王文山又产生了新的顾虑，他想：万一厂部的原材料和工具、卡具供给不及时，以后发生了间断工时和停工待料，可就糟啦！因此，他当时没有坚持斗争下去。以厂长汪洪文同志为首的人们，就趁机以他们所作的“查定”结果为根据，通过了只增加生产十七台的保守计划。
    王文山非常苦恼。他想，国家开始了大规模经济建设，决不能因为车间里有两个落后工段，就订个落后的计划。这时候，党的总支书记又鼓励他，希望他拿出共产党员应有的气魄，坚持斗争下去。王文山在车间党支部和市委工作组的支持下，在施工室技术人员的具体帮助下，重新发动群众讨论计划。这一次，由于技术人员的帮助，突破了一、三工段这两个薄弱环节，使制造大丝杠工时定额由八十小时缩短到十八小时；制造床头箱从七十小时缩短到三十五小时。全车间职工的信心更高了，决定在原来增加一百台的基础上，再增加二十台，并在毛主席像前庄严地宣誓；保证完成任务。但是工厂管理委员会讨论这个计划时，生产科长还说：“要增加顶多能增加十七台，否则达不到均衡生产，谁负责？”这时，像生产科长这样顽固的保守思想，已经没人去理睬他了，二车间的计划，被大家一致通过了。
    王文山与保守思想斗争的胜利影响了全厂。二车间从原来计划生产二百八十台车床部件，增加到三百八十七台。这个消息鼓舞了其他车间的职工。第一车间也把原来计划装配一百九十五台车床改为装配三百一十一台。因此，机械一厂今年不是要国家赔本七亿元，而是要给国家创造二百六十多亿元的财富了。现在，生产科长和计划科长都服了劲，说：“下回可别坐在办公室里做生产计划啦！”汪厂长也在全厂职工面前做了检讨。目前，机械一厂职工正为迎接红五月和全国七次劳动大会，开展了高速切削竞赛，为完成自己制订的先进计划而积极热情地劳动着。
