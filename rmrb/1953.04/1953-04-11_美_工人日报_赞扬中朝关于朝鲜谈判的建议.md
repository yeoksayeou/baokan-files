Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 10th: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on April 1st regarding the Sino-North Korean side's peace proposal for the Korean armistice negotiations, stating, "There is no longer any reason for American soldiers to die in Korea." The editorial pointed out that the Sino-North Korean side made this decision not out of weakness but because of strength. The editorial said, "They have proactively taken great diplomatic actions to seek a complete armistice and end this accursed war. This action will be heartily welcomed by the majority of people in the world." The editorial called on the American people to pay attention to "those war-mongering figures who are profiting from our blood" and to prevent them from closing the door to peace opened by the initiative of China and North Korea. The editorial also said that peace in Korea would make it possible for the United States to conduct peaceful trade with the 800 million people of socialist countries, and would turn the $70 billion now wasted on "defense" into housing, schools, roads, and hospitals for the American people. The editorial concluded by calling on the American people to "take immediate action to strive for peace in Korea."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Prague: The New York "Daily Worker" reported that Vito Marcantonio, chairman of the American Labor Party and former U.S. Congressman, sent a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower on April 2nd, requesting that Eisenhower immediately realize an armistice in Korea. The letter was passed by 400 delegates attending the American Labor Party's monthly meeting. Marcantonio pointed out that the issue now is for Eisenhower to fulfill the promise he made during last year's election campaign to end the Korean War. He said, "Our people, and people everywhere, are devoutly praying that this result will be achieved." Marcantonio said that Zhou Enlai's proposal meets all the requirements for this goal. Marcantonio concluded, "In the name of the chairman of the American Labor Party, on behalf of my party's 58,000 members, I urge you to take all steps to ensure that an armistice is immediately achieved."

    美“工人日报”赞扬中朝关于朝鲜谈判的建议
    【新华社布拉格十日电】纽约“工人日报”四月一日就中朝方面关于朝鲜停战谈判的和平建议发表社论说：“再没有任何理由要美国士兵死在朝鲜了。”社论指出：中朝方面作出这个决定，不是由于软弱而是由于力量强大。社论说：“他们主动地在外交上采取伟大的行动来设法达成全部停战并结束这场可诅咒的战争。他们这个行动将获得世界大多数人民的衷心的欢迎。”社论要求美国人民注意“现在那帮从我们的鲜血中汲取利润的渴望战争的人物”，防止他们把朝中两国的主动行动所打开的和平大门关闭起来。社论又说：朝鲜和平使美国将来有可能与社会主义国家的八亿人民进行和平的贸易，并使现在白白耗费在“防务”上面的七百亿美元变成供美国人民享用的住房、学校、公路和医院。社论最后要求美国人民“为争取朝鲜和平而立即行动起来。”据新华社布拉格讯：纽约“工人日报”报道：美国劳工党主席、前美国国会议员维托·马肯托尼奥在四月二日给美国总统艾森豪威尔一封信，要求艾森豪威尔立即实现朝鲜停战。这封信是参加美国劳工党每月召开的会议的四百名代表所通过的。马肯托尼奥指出：现在的问题就在艾森豪威尔实践他去年竞选时所作的结束朝鲜战争的诺言。他说：“我们的人民以及每一个地方的人民都在虔诚地祈求这种结果会实现。”马肯托尼奥说：周恩来的建议满足了这个目标的一切要求。马肯托尼奥最后说：“我以美国劳工党主席的名义，代表我党五万八千个党员，吁请你采取一切步骤使停战立即实现。”
