Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: The Second National Women's Congress of China continued its plenary session on the 20th. Lu Cui, Director of the International Work Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Wang Ziru, Director of the Urban Work Department, respectively delivered speeches to the Congress on "Speech on the Copenhagen World Women's Congress" and "Explanation on the Revision of the Charter of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation." Lu Cui first reported to the Congress on the significance of the World Women's Congress, which will be held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, in June this year. She said: "Chinese women, under the patriotic and internationalist education of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, deeply understand that building the motherland and defending world peace are two inseparable and glorious tasks. Chinese women have long suffered from the hardships of wars of aggression, so we deeply know the value of peace. Now that the revolution has triumphed, in order to build our prosperous motherland and create our happy life, we need a peaceful environment to engage in peaceful construction. Therefore, we love peace and wholeheartedly support the cause of world people in defending peace. The convening of the World Women's Congress is conducive to the cause of defending world peace, and we should warmly support it." Lu Cui then cited facts to illustrate that the Chinese women's movement is closely linked with the entire international women's democratic movement. The struggle and victory of women in any country for peace, independence, and a happy life are a major assistance to the Chinese people; and every achievement of our victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the construction of our motherland has also supported them. She pointed out: "Our task is to expose all the lies of the war instigators, develop mutual understanding and mutual support between people and people, women and women, unite the strength of the people and women of all countries, and fight for defending world peace, for friendship between the people of all countries, and for the happy life of women and children." She asked the representatives present to publicize the significance of convening the World Women's Congress to the broad masses of Chinese women.

After listening to the two reports, the representatives held group discussions on issues related to the World Women's Congress and the draft revision of the Democratic Women's Federation Charter. The representatives expressed the wishes of Chinese women who have made important contributions to defending world peace, and unanimously expressed their determination and will to defend peace and defend the rights of women and children. Deng Fangzhi, the mother of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army martyr Huang Jiguang, sacrificed her beloved son to support Korea and defend world peace. Today she said: "How difficult it is for a mother to raise a child! Raising a child with urine and feces, how can I not be sad about Jiguang's sacrifice? But he died to help Korea and to protect the peaceful life of millions of mothers and children in the world, and I feel very honored. Now, I don't want to see mothers shed tears for losing their children in the war, and I want to fight for peace to the end! If it is needed to strive for peace, I am willing to dedicate another child—Huang Jishu." He Xianglian, a women's representative from Andong City, Northeast China, standing on the front line of national defense, said: "We are often threatened by war, bombarded and strafed by American planes, and harmed by germ warfare. We must use the power of peace to stop it." Female representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, female labor models in industry and agriculture, and female representatives from other social strata unanimously guaranteed that they would lead the broad masses of Chinese women with their practical actions to actively fight for supporting Korea, defending the motherland, and defending world peace, and actively prepare to participate in the upcoming World Women's Congress.

Also speaking at the meeting today were Hu Xinhua, representative from the Northwest Region, Sun Ruizhi, representative from the North China Region, Tan Kexing and Shamasishi (Yi ethnicity), representatives from the Southwest Region, and Liu Wang Liming, representative of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association. They introduced the experience of women's work in various regions and the work of the Women's Temperance Association.

The Congress will be adjourned for one day on the 21st. The plenary session will continue on the 22nd.

    讨论世界妇女大会问题和修改民主妇联章程
    【新华社二十日讯】中国第二次全国妇女代表大会二十日继续举行全体会议。中华全国民主妇女联合会国际工作部部长陆璀、城市工作部部长王子如，分别向大会作了“关于哥本哈根世界妇女大会的发言”和“修改中华全国民主妇女联合会章程的说明”。陆璀首先向大会报告世界妇女大会召开的意义，这个大会将于今年六月在丹麦首都哥本哈根举行。她说：“我们中国妇女在毛主席和中国共产党的爱国主义与国际主义教育下，深深懂得建设祖国和保卫世界和平是不可分割的两大光荣任务。中国妇女曾长期遭受过侵略战争的苦难，因此，我们深刻地知道和平的可贵。现在革命胜利了，为了建设我们繁荣的祖国，为了创造我们的幸福生活，我们更需要一个和平的环境来从事和平建设。因此，我们热爱和平，并衷心拥护世界人民保卫和平的事业。世界妇女大会的召开是有利于保卫世界和平事业的，我们应该热烈地拥护它。”陆璀接着又列举事实说明：中国的妇女运动是和整个国际妇女民主运动紧密联系在一起的。任何一个国家中的妇女为和平、独立和幸福生活而进行的斗争和取得的胜利，对中国人民都是重大的援助；而我们抗美援朝斗争的胜利和建设祖国事业上的每一项成就，也都支援了她们。她指出：“我们的任务就是要揭露战争挑拨者的一切谎话，发展人民和人民、妇女和妇女之间的相互了解和相互支持，团结各国人民和妇女的力量，为保卫世界和平，为各国人民之间的友好和妇女儿童的幸福生活而斗争。”她要求到会代表们向中国广大妇女宣传召开世界妇女大会的意义。
    代表们在听取了两个报告后，分组讨论了有关世界妇女大会的问题和民主妇联章程修改草案。代表们表达了对保卫世界和平有过重要贡献的中国妇女的心愿，一致表示了她们保卫和平、保卫妇女儿童权利的决心和意志。中国人民志愿军烈士黄继光的母亲邓芳芝，为了支援朝鲜，保卫世界和平，献出了自己的心爱的儿子。她今天说：“母亲扶养一个孩子多么不容易呵！尿里来屎里去把孩子养大，继光的牺牲，怎能叫我不难过呢？但他是为了帮助朝鲜，为了保护世界千千万万母亲和孩子的和平生活而死的，我觉得非常光荣。现在，我不愿再看到母亲为在战争中失掉孩子而流泪，我要为和平而斗争到底！如果为了争取和平的需要，我愿意再献出另一个孩子——黄继淑。”站在祖国国防最前线——东北安东市妇女代表何香莲说：“我们经常受到战争的威胁，受到美国飞机的轰炸、扫射和细菌战的祸害，我们一定要用和平的力量来制止。”中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的女代表，工业和农业的女劳动模范以及其他阶层的女代表们，一致保证要以自己的实际行动，带领中国广大妇女，积极为支援朝鲜、保卫祖国和保卫世界和平而奋斗，并积极准备参加即将召开的世界妇女大会。
    今天在大会上发言的还有西北区代表胡新华，华北区代表孙瑞芝，西南区代表谭克兴、沙马使且（彝族）和中华妇女节制协会代表刘王立明。她们介绍了各地区妇女工作的经验和妇女节制协会的工作情况。
