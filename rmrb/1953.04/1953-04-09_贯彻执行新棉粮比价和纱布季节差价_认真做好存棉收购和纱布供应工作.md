The recent directive of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council regarding the 1953 cotton-grain price ratio is a correct measure conducive to guiding the more normal and healthier development of industrial and agricultural production and the market in our country. Comrades in all regions should, in accordance with the spirit of this directive and in conjunction with local specific conditions, under the leadership of the local Party and government, correctly explain it to cotton farmers where necessary, and conscientiously ensure that this correct policy and important measure is implemented.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, China was the largest market for the "cheap dumping" of surplus cotton by American imperialism. American cotton imports reached a peak of 5,679,000 dan in 1946, forcing domestic cotton to have no market. At that time, the ratio of domestic cotton to grain, in wheat areas, was often below one to five jin, and in rice and millet areas, it was below one to five and a half jin. As a result, national cotton production shrank, and the total cotton output in 1949 was far from meeting the needs of the national cotton textile industry.

In the three years since liberation, in order to meet the requirements of self-sufficiency for cotton spinning mills and civilian cotton wadding, the People's Government has taken a series of measures to increase cotton production. For example, in 1949, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council convened a national cotton conference, proposing the policy of developing cotton production and supplying the needs of the textile industry, and immediately organized state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies, cooperatives, and private merchants to purchase raw cotton, fully guaranteeing the interests of cotton farmers in terms of price. In the spring of 1950, under the leadership of the Party and government, a cotton production increase campaign was launched in cotton-producing areas throughout the country, specifically helping cotton farmers solve difficulties such as funds and seeds, fertilizers, etc. A major measure was to raise and guarantee the cotton-grain price ratio, making it more profitable for farmers to grow cotton than grain, and enabling cotton farmers to obtain the actual benefits of increased cotton prices, increasing cotton farmers' confidence in planting cotton, and providing favorable conditions for the rapid development of cotton production.

In the spring of 1950, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council began to stipulate the cotton-grain price ratio. State-owned trade controlled the purchase price at no less than eight jin in wheat and rice areas and no less than eight and a half jin in millet areas. The cotton-grain price ratio announced in 1951 was: one to eight jin in wheat areas, and one to eight and a half jin in millet and rice areas. The price ratio announced in 1952 was: one to seven and a half to eight and a half jin in wheat areas, and one to eight to nine jin in millet and rice areas. As a result of the state's formulation of an extremely favorable cotton-grain price ratio for the development of cotton production over the past three years, the area planted with cotton and the output nationwide have developed and increased rapidly. For example, if the cotton output in 1949 is taken as 100, then 1950 was 183, 1951 was 286, and 1952 was 334, far exceeding the highest pre-war annual output.

Due to the rapid development of cotton production, the amount of raw cotton and textiles stored by the state this year has also greatly increased. Therefore, if cotton fields continue to increase without limit in the future, the cotton produced will greatly exceed the current needs of the cotton textile industry and civilian cotton wadding, which will not only be unfavorable to cotton farmers but also cause the state to accumulate capital in this area. In order to increase grain production, promote the normal development of cotton production, and for the long-term interests of cotton farmers, it is entirely necessary and timely to appropriately lower the cotton-grain price ratio this year.

This new cotton-grain price ratio is still slightly higher than the pre-war level. Due to the increased enthusiasm of the vast number of cotton farmers for production, the continuous improvement of farming techniques, the work of the government's agricultural departments in improving cotton production, and the policy of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of paying higher prices for superior cotton, such as the price increases for improved varieties and grade differences announced successively since 1950, have all played a significant role in improving cotton production and increasing yields per unit area. In addition, with the promotion of excellent seeds over the years, the average yield of cotton per mu nationwide has increased from an average of 18.2 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1949 to an average of 31.1 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1952 (the highest-yielding areas, such as Shanxi Province, have an average yield of 48.8 jin), and will continue to increase in the future. Therefore, after the new cotton is put on the market this autumn, according to the new cotton-grain price ratio recently announced by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, although it will be slightly reduced, the actual income of cotton farmers will still be favorable.

Due to the continuous improvement of cotton production, in addition to the increase in output, the length of cotton is also continuously increasing. Although the state's current purchase of cotton is still temporarily based on 7/8 inch as the pricing standard, in fact, more than 70% of the cotton produced in 1952 has a length exceeding 7/8 inch. In the future, continuing to carry out cotton production improvement and continuously correcting the tendency of downgrading in purchasing technology, the length of raw cotton will soon all or mostly exceed 7/8 inch. For cotton farmers, the income difference between the actual length of cotton they produce and the length of the national pricing standard is also something they have not had in the past.

In terms of the management of domestic cotton, there have also been tremendous changes in the past three years. State-owned economy now accounts for a large proportion. At present, the cotton used by all public and private cotton spinning mills in the country is supplied through the state-owned trade system, and most of the civilian cotton wadding is also regulated by the state-owned trade system. Due to the close combination of the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy, the market is controlled, and purchases are made according to national listed prices. Cotton farmers have been able to get rid of all unreasonable price suppression losses. In the past, because cotton production had not fully met the needs of increased yarn and cloth production and the vast number of people's cotton wadding needs, the state had not stipulated seasonal price differences for a long time in order to reduce the hoarding of cotton in the free market and enable cotton farmers to sell in a timely manner.

In 1952, the state's purchase of cotton exceeded the plan by a large margin, and this once affected the deployment of state-owned trade funds, affecting cotton farmers' timely and large-scale resale of cotton to cooperatives. In order to improve this situation in the future, the national listed price of cotton in various regions must be stipulated according to reasonable seasonal price differences for new cotton after autumn, which will enable cotton farmers to sell their stored cotton successively according to national needs, without causing disconnections. At present, cotton farmers still have some stored cotton in their hands, which will all be sold before autumn. Therefore, state-owned companies and cooperatives must overcome the shortcomings existing in the purchasing work, further strengthen the timely deployment of grain and other materials to cotton-producing areas, ensure that cotton farmers receive various conveniences when selling their stored cotton, and ensure that cotton prices are completely stable.

The Central Ministry of Commerce also adjusted the seasonal price differences for yarn and cloth nationwide on April 1. This measure of reasonably adjusting prices is not only beneficial to the interests of production, transportation, and sales, but also provides a new example of maintaining necessary and reasonable "seasonal price differences" for certain industrial products under the actual economic conditions of our country today. We must earnestly understand this new content of "seasonal price differences," which is different from the old China, and correctly implement it.

Before liberation, under the conditions of inflation, yarn and cloth were often used as leading commodities driving price increases. Now, with the strengthening of state-owned trade and cooperative forces and the increase in the proportion of yarn and cloth management, the urban yarn and cloth market has completely changed its past speculative nature and become an operation facing actual sales and facing the countryside. The period when we were forced to rely on price increases and decreases and rigidly compress consumption to stabilize prices due to insufficient production has also ended due to the complete stabilization of prices and the large increase in yarn and cloth production last year. However, due to the existence of the current decentralized free market and the very poor understanding of the actual needs of the people by state-owned enterprises, production and sales are still highly blind. In the future, we should combine the continuous improvement of planning and, through this reasonable adjustment of "seasonal price differences" of industrial products, further use it to guide production, guide consumption, regulate supply and demand, and give full play to its positive role in the important commodity circulation link of yarn and cloth through the correct control of listed prices by state-owned commerce. At present, there are still many problems in our yarn and cloth varieties and regional price differences. According to the spirit of the instructions of the Central Ministry of Commerce, we should promptly conduct inspections based on the specific conditions of various regions, put forward reasonable adjustment opinions for research and handling, and improve and improve our price work.

Due to the improvement of people's living standards and the increase in purchasing power, the requirements for the quality of yarn and cloth are obviously different from the past. Therefore, in order to fully supply the needs of the people, improving the work of variety regulation has become our current primary task and is also the central content of improving operations.

    贯彻执行新棉粮比价和纱布季节差价
    认真做好存棉收购和纱布供应工作
    中央商业部工业商品贸易局局长  陈其襄
    政务院财政经济委员会最近公布的一九五三年棉粮比价指示，是有利于引导我国工农业生产与市场更正常地更健康地发展的正确措施，各地工作同志应遵照这个指示的精神，结合各地具体情况，在当地党政领导下，正确地向棉农进行必要的解释，并认真地使这个正确的政策和重要措施得到贯彻。
    在国民党反动统治时期，中国是美帝国主义剩余棉花“廉价倾销”的最大市场，美棉入口最高额在一九四六年达五百六十七万九千市担，迫使国产棉花没有销路。当时国内棉花与粮食的比价，小麦地区，往往在一比五斤以下，大米及小米地区则在一比五斤半以下，因此全国棉产萎缩，一九四九年全部棉产量远不足全国棉纺织业的需要。
    解放三年以来，为了达到我国棉纺厂及民用絮棉能够自给的要求，人民政府在棉花增产方面，曾采取了一系列措施，如一九四九年，政务院财政经济委员会召开全国棉花会议，提出发展棉产、供应纺织工业需要的方针，并立即组织国营花纱布公司、合作社和私商收购原棉；在价格上充分保证了棉农利益。一九五○年春，在党政领导下，在全国棉产区发动增产棉花运动，具体帮助棉农解决资金与种籽、肥料等困难。其中主要的一项措施，即提高与保证棉粮比价，使农民种植棉花比种粮有利，并使棉农获得棉价提高後的实际利益，增加棉农植棉信心，为棉花生产迅速发展提供了有利条件。
        一九五○年春，政务院财政经济委员会开始规定棉粮比价，国营贸易在收购价格上，掌握小麦与大米地区不低于八斤，小米地区不低于八斤半。一九五一年公布的棉粮比价为：小麦地区一比八斤，小米及大米地区一比八斤半。一九五二年公布的比价为：小麦地区一比七斤半至八斤半，小米及大米地区一比八斤至九斤。由于三年来国家制定了对于发展棉花生产极为有利的棉粮比价的结果，从而全国植棉面积及产量均有迅速发展与增加，如以一九四九年的棉产量为一○○，则一九五○年为一八三，一九五一年为二八六，一九五二年为三三四，已远超过战前最高年产量。
    由于棉花生产迅速发展，今年国家储存的原棉及纺织品的数量，亦大大增加，因之今后如继续使棉田无限制地增加，则所产的棉花将大大超过目前棉纺织业及民用絮棉的需要，非但对棉农不利，且将造成国家对这方面的资金积压。为了使粮食增产，使棉产正常发展，为了棉农的长远利益，把今年棉粮比价予以适当调低是完全必要与适时的。
    这一新的棉粮比价，还稍高于战前的水平。由于广大棉农生产积极性提高，耕作技术的不断改进，人民政府农业部门改良棉产的工作，政务院财经委员会规定的优棉优价的政策，如一九五○年起先后公布的良种加价及等级差价，对改进棉产提高单位面积产量都起了很大作用，加上历年优良种籽的推广，全国棉花每亩单位面积的产量，业已由一九四九年平均每亩产皮棉一八点二斤，提高至一九五二年的平均每亩产皮棉三一点一斤（最高产区如山西省平均产量已达四八点八斤），今后还将继续提高。因此，今年新棉上市后，根据政务院财经委员会最近公布的新棉粮比价，虽稍见降低，但棉农的实际所得，仍将是有利的。
    由于棉产不断改进，除产量增加外，棉花长度亦在不断提高。目前国家收购棉花虽仍暂以八分之七吋为定价标准，事实上，一九五二年生产的棉花，已有百分之七十以上的长度超过八分之七吋；今后继续进行棉产改良和不断纠正收购技术中的压级偏向，原棉长度很快将全部或绝大部分超过八分之七吋。这对于棉农来说，其实际生产棉花的长度，超过国家定价标准的长度间的差额收益，也是过去所没有的。
    国产棉花的经营方面，三年来也有了巨大的变化。现在国营经济已经占很大比重，目前全国公私营棉纺厂用棉，已全部通过国营贸易系统供应，民用絮棉也大部分由国营贸易系统调剂。由于国营经济与合作社经济密切结合，掌握市场，按国家牌价进行收购，棉农已能摆脱一切不合理的压价损失。过去，因棉产量尚未完全满足纱布增产及广大人民絮棉需要，为了减少棉花在自由市场囤留，并使棉农及时出售起见，国家长期未曾规定季节性差价。
    一九五二年的棉花，国家收购已超过计划甚多，并曾因此一度影响国营贸易资金调度，影响棉农及时向合作社大量续售棉花。今后为了改进此种情况，秋后新棉，须按合理季节差价规定各地棉花牌价，这就更能使棉农根据国家需要，陆续出售存棉，不致发生脱节现象。目前棉农手里尚有部分存棉，在秋前将全部出售，因此国营公司及合作社必须克服收购工作中存在的缺点，进一步对棉产区粮食及其他物资供应加以及时调度，务使棉农出售存棉时得到各种便利，并保证棉价完全稳定。
    中央商业部同时于四月一日调整全国纱布季节差价，这一合理调整价格的措施，既有利于产运消三方面利益，同时更提供了某些工业品在今天我国实际经济情况下，保持必要的合理“季节差价”的新范例。我们对这一不同于旧中国的“季节差价”的新内容，必须认真领会，并正确贯彻执行。
    在解放前通货膨胀的情况下，纱布经常被作为领导物价飞涨的带头商品。现在国营贸易、合作社力量壮大，掌握纱布经营比重提高，已使城市纱布市场彻底改变了过去投机的性质，成为面向实销、面向农村的经营。在生产不足时被迫依靠价格升降、硬性压缩消费、平稳物价的时期，也已因去年物价完全稳定，纱布大量增产而告结束。但由于目前分散的自由市场存在，国营企业对人民实际需要情况了解还很差，因之生产与销售尚带有极大盲目性，今后应结合计划性的不断提高，通过这次工业品“季节差价”的合理调整，进一步运用它指导生产、指导消费、调剂供求，并通过国营商业正确掌握牌价，在纱布这项重要商品流转环节中，发挥其积极作用。目前我们在纱布品种、地区差价中，均存在很多问题，根据此次中央商业部指示精神，应就各地具体情况及时进行检查，提出合理调整意见，以便研究处理，并提高和改进我们的物价工作。
    由于人民生活水平提高，购买力增长，对纱布品质要求，已显然与过去不同。因之，为了充分供应人民需要，对于改善品种调剂工作，已成为我们当前首要任务，也是改善经营的中心内容。
