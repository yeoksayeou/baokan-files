Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th – The Korean and Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations released the following communique on April 7th: The second meeting of the liaison groups from both sides was held at Panmunjom at 11:00 a.m. on April 7th.

General Li Sang-cho, head of our liaison group, proposed at the meeting on April 6th that we are not only prepared to repatriate all seriously ill and seriously wounded prisoners of war, but also prepared to repatriate all sick and wounded prisoners of war. The other side expressed agreement with our opinion at the meeting on April 7th, but attached a condition, namely: the repatriation of all these sick and wounded prisoners of war must be in accordance with the provisions of Article 109, paragraph 3 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.

Article 109, paragraph 3 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War stipulates that seriously ill and seriously wounded prisoners of war shall not be repatriated against their will during hostilities. General Li Sang-cho pointed out that this provision must not be used as an excuse to obstruct the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war who wish to be repatriated during hostilities. General Li Sang-cho reiterated that we are prepared to immediately directly repatriate all sick and wounded prisoners of war in our custody to the other side, but we reserve the right to demand that prisoners of war held by the other side who are not directly repatriated be interned in neutral countries.

After both sides had a mutual understanding of the scope of the direct repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, we suggested that both sides immediately enter into discussions on the detailed arrangements for the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. The other side proposed a draft agreement in this regard at the meeting on April 6th. Our side stated at the meeting on April 7th that, after preliminary study, we believe that this draft can be used as the basis for both sides to discuss the details of the arrangement, and we immediately expressed our agreement with the clauses such as using the Panmunjom conference area as the exchange location for sick and wounded prisoners of war.

At the same meeting, our side also notified the other side that we are actively verifying the number of all sick and wounded prisoners of war in our custody, and we estimate that we can notify the other side of the verification results in one or two days.

The third meeting of the liaison groups of both sides is scheduled to be held at 11:00 a.m. on April 8th.

    朝鲜谈判双方联络组第二次会议
    双方已相互了解直接遣返病伤战俘的范围我建议立即讨论遣返病伤战俘的细节安排
    【新华社开城七日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月七日发表公报如下：双方联络组第二次会议于四月七日上午十一时在板门店举行。
    我方联络组组长李相朝将军，在四月六日的会上曾提出我方不但准备遣返所有重病重伤战俘，而且准备遣返所有病伤战俘。对方在四月七日会上，对我方这一意见表示同意。但附以条件，即：遣返所有这些病伤战俘时都必须参照日内瓦战俘公约第一零九条第三项的规定。
    日内瓦战俘公约第一零九条第三项规定在战事期间不得违反重病重伤战俘的意志而将其遣返。李相朝将军指出这一项规定决不能被用作借口来阻挠愿在战事期间遣返的病伤战俘。李相朝将军并再一次表示：我们准备立即将所有我方收容下的病伤战俘直接遣返给对方，但我方保留权利提出要求将未被直接遣返的对方收容下的战俘收容于中立国。
    在双方对于此次直接遣返的病伤战俘的范围相互有所了解以后，我方建议双方立即进入遣返病伤战俘的细节安排的讨论。对方在四月六日会上曾在这一方面提出一协定草案，我方在四月七日会上表示：经初步研究后，我方认为这一草案可以作为双方讨论细节安排问题的基础，对于其中以板门店会场区为交换病伤战俘地点等条款，我方并当即表示同意。
    同日会上，我方并通知对方：我方正在积极清查在我方收容下的所有病伤战俘的数目，估计在一、二日内即可将清查结果通知对方。
    双方联络组第三次会议定于四月八日上午十一时举行。
