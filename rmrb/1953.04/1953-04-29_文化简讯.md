        Significant Achievements in Rural Health Construction in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of Jiangxi
    The rural health construction in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province has made great achievements. More than 500 health centers (stations) have been established in various places, with more than 2,700 medical and health personnel. Some key areas' health centers are also equipped with beds and necessary equipment for performing various important surgeries. Some areas have also established specialized health treatment institutions such as maternal and child health centers and malaria prevention stations. In order to solve the medical needs of farmers living in areas with inconvenient transportation and far from health clinics, medical workers in various parts of Jiangxi Province also frequently organize rural mobile medical teams to go deep into remote mountainous areas to treat farmers. In the past year, these medical institutions have provided free medical care to hundreds of thousands of farmers in the old revolutionary base areas, including more than 200,000 family members of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. Now, the health conditions in the rural areas of the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province have been greatly improved, the number of farmers getting sick is decreasing day by day, and the health of mothers and infants, in particular, has been greatly guaranteed.

        Dihua City Holds Grand Sports Competitions
    The grand sports competitions held by people of all ethnic groups in Dihua City to celebrate "May 1st" International Labor Day and "May 4th" Youth Day began on the 26th in People's Square. Workers and young students of all ethnic groups actively participated in the competition. There were 101 teams in the workers' and general groups participating in ball games, 47 teams participating in tug-of-war, and 10 teams participating in rope skipping, with a total of 1,800 participants.
    The most eye-catching program in the competition activities was the model airplane flight performance hosted by the Xinjiang Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The model airplanes were made by the teenagers of all ethnic groups in Dihua City with their own wisdom and labor, and 70 have now been made.

    The Central Academy of Drama's Affiliated Song and Dance Theater's Performances in Factories and Mines Around Beijing Are Well Received
    The newly arranged opera "Xiao Erhei Gets Married" by the Central Academy of Drama's Affiliated Song and Dance Theater has embarked on a two-month tour of factories and mines near Beijing starting from April 9th. The scheduled plan is to perform for the Changxindian Railway Factory and the 11th Factory, Liulihe Cement Plant, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, Qinghe Woolen Mill, and construction workers in the suburbs of Beijing from April 9th to the end of the month. Starting from the beginning of May, they will perform for workers in the city, the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Steel Plant, and the Mentougou Coal Mine, and will also provide some guest performances for the nearby troops as much as possible.
    Workers in the suburbs of Beijing rarely have the opportunity to see Beijing operas, and they expressed their gratitude to the Song and Dance Theater for coming to the factories this time. Because the opera closely cooperated with the Marriage Law implementation movement, it greatly helped and inspired the worker comrades and their families in learning about the Marriage Law, and it was generally welcomed by the worker comrades and the troops. They are determined to respond by increasing production and completing the production plan ahead of schedule. They eagerly hope that professional art troupes in Beijing can often come to the factories to perform. The enthusiasm of the worker comrades has also greatly encouraged the comrades who went down this time. They expressed that they must often go down to the factories in the future to perform for the worker comrades to strengthen the connection between professional art troupes and workers.

        江西老根据地农村卫生建设有成绩
    江西省老革命根据地的农村卫生建设有很大成绩。各地已经设立了五百多所卫生院（所），有二千七百多个医疗卫生人员，部分重点地区的卫生院中还备有病床和施行各项重要手术的必要器材。有些地区还设立了妇幼保健所、疟疾防治站等专业卫生治疗机构。为了解决居住在交通不便、距离卫生所较远地带的农民的医药问题，江西省各地医务工作者还经常组织乡村巡回医疗队，深入偏僻山区为农民治病。近一年来，由这些医疗机构免费医疗的老区农民有数十万人，其中革命烈士家属和革命军人家属有二十多万人。现在，江西省老根据地农村中的卫生面貌已经大大改观，农民生病的人数日益减少，特别是产妇和婴儿的健康有了很大的保障。

    中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院新排歌剧“小二黑结婚”，已从四月九日起赴京郊附近各厂矿作为期两月的巡回演出。预定计划从四月九日起至月底为长辛店铁路工厂及十一厂、琉璃河水泥厂、华北农业机械总厂，清河制呢厂及京郊建筑工人演出，五月初起为市内工人、石景山发电厂、钢铁厂和门头沟煤矿工人演出，并对附近驻军也尽可能作部分招待演出。
