    Defending the Eternal Spring of the Motherland
    Wang Ming
    Spring arrives in Korea. A company of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is guarding a large river on the Korean front. The river has thawed, and ice floes crash down, making a rushing sound. This scene reminds our soldiers of the spring in their motherland: when the Songhua River thaws, when the Mudan River thaws, when any river in the motherland thaws, isn't it just like this?
    "Spring is here!"
    "In our hometown, rape flowers are blooming at this time! Fields of gold!"
    "That's right, in our hometown, the pea seedlings are sprouting!"
    The soldiers digging fortifications are all talking about spring, talking about the alluring scenes of spring in the motherland. When they get to the most excited parts, they jump up like children and start singing.
    Not long ago, soldier Zhang Shaowu received a letter from his mother, which said: "The weather is cold now, but when spring comes, I will definitely take a picture with little Suqin and send it to you. I hope you bravely kill the enemy in Korea and perform meritorious service for the people!" This is a very ordinary family letter, but it brings a particularly strong sense of warmth and belonging to those far away from their motherland.
    "Zhang Shaowu's mother wrote, saying she'll send a photo in the spring, and she's taking his little daughter Suqin to have her picture taken too!" On the day he received the letter, squad leader Sun Liqing happily shouted loudly, holding the letter high. The soldiers looked up at the letter, then at Zhang Shaowu, and everyone laughed. It seemed as if this letter was not just for Zhang Shaowu alone, but that everyone had a share in it.
    Now that spring is here, his mother should be taking the picture – thinking of this, Zhang Shaowu worked even harder, his eyes shining with joy.
    One soldier, while swinging his pickaxe, said, "Digging this stuff, it's not tiring or difficult, that's a lie; but the significance is great! Don't underestimate this pickaxe, this drill, this hammer; they are changing the world situation. The pickaxe may be small, but its impact is huge. Precisely because of this, no one dares to touch our motherland! We are digging tunnels and building fortifications here, so that the motherland can carry out large-scale construction, and Zhang Shaowu's mother can take his granddaughter to have her picture taken. The motherland is like that. Look, the Fushun coal that was transported a few days ago, the large timber from Jilin that was transported yesterday, all came from the motherland, truckload after truckload! What we eat, wear, and use, which of it doesn't come from the motherland? It all does. If we didn't have a strong motherland behind us, could we do it? We couldn't, definitely couldn't!" He talked on and on, and no other soldier could get a word in edgewise. Everyone listened as he continued, "We fight a few beautiful battles for the motherland, earn a special-class merit or a first-class merit, and return victoriously to the motherland. The children of the motherland shout 'Volunteer Army Uncle,' 'Most Beloved Person,' then you'll feel really comfortable!" He got more and more excited, and with a mighty swing of his pickaxe, with a "kaboom" sound, a large piece of green stone fell off...
    This company has two honorary titles – "Iron Company" and "Heroic Company that Broke Through the Imjin River." Since entering Korea, the battles of War Cloud Mountain, breaking through the Imjin River, capturing Pyongyang, and seizing Seoul, so many glorious victories have been linked to the name of this heroic company. The company commanders are all either heroes or merit holders. Therefore, every soldier in the company has a strong desire: "Learn from the company commanders, perform meritorious service for the motherland, and become a hero who goes to Beijing!" Among the heroes of this company, the name of Zheng Qi is sure to be known by the people of the motherland. He is a special-class merit holder and second-class combat hero from the Battle of Bugok-ri, and is now the deputy instructor of the Iron Company. In that battle, he was still a bugler. When the company officers were sacrificed, he took over command and, together with his comrades, defended a small hill. His resounding bugle call encouraged his comrades to repel the enemy's frenzied counterattacks time and time again, and finally, in coordination with friendly units, they won the victory.
    "That sound of the charge bugle was truly the sound of the motherland!" Zheng Qi recalled the scene at the time, "We all felt that to be a Chinese, to be a soldier of the Iron Company, you had to be tough as iron."
    Once, I chatted with Shen Ming, the battalion commander of the Iron Company, about everything under the sun. The battalion commander is a young man of twenty-three. His mother recently sent him a letter from the Northeast, also an ordinary letter, also revealing deep maternal love and a strong sense of belonging. His mother told him: This year, the family made two new quilts and a new cotton-padded coat; a production plan was made: raise two pigs, and when the pigs are fattened, sell one and buy four more piglets and twenty chicks. His mother also said to him: "Fight the devils well, and send back a notice of victory when you perform meritorious service!" This is his mother's earnest wish. The son replied: "In the next battle, you watch, our battalion will definitely fight its way to becoming a heroic battalion, and I will personally lead the Iron Company to fight! We will thoroughly defeat any kind of adventurous offensive by the enemy, we are definitely confident! Only in this way can we be worthy of being the most beloved people of the motherland!" This is a commander's determination, and also a son's oath to his mother.
    Here, you can feel everywhere how the soldiers' hearts are interconnected with the motherland. Not long ago, the soldiers built several new houses, and each house can be connected to the front line. A small signalman said to me with a smile, "You won't believe it, the path next to these new houses can even lead to the motherland!" He also said, "If there could be a radio in the house, how wonderful it would be, we could hear the motherland speak every day!" Yes, how much the soldiers long to hear the voice of the motherland! Sometimes, by a fortunate chance, the soldiers are able to sit around a radio, they will instinctively tune the wavelength to Beijing, and someone will say in a deep tone: "Listen, the motherland..." Then everyone will immediately fall silent, prick up their ears, widen their eyes, and listen attentively. At this time, every pair of eyes of the soldiers are filled with a peaceful, joyful, and innocent expression, as if snuggling in their mother's arms, listening to a touching story like naive children.
    I remember that on the Spring Festival day, the motherland transported sixty-proof liquor. Several signalmen sat around the table. They were all clever, lively, and mischievous young men. They drank, sang, and talked and laughed loudly. Suddenly, one of them became quiet, solemnly lit the liquor in his glass, and watched the jumping blue flame with his chin in his hands and his eyes narrowed. Everyone shouted at him, protesting his waste, but he didn't say a word. After the fire went out and the alcohol burned off, he picked up the glass, drank the remaining water in one gulp, stood up, and waved his hand and shouted, "Comrades, it's so sweet! I've been abroad for more than two years, and today I tasted the water of our Northeast!"
    Also on the Spring Festival day, the comrades of the Iron Company put out the most beloved things sent by the motherland, letters, photos, a large stack of them. There were those sent from Beijing, those sent from the Northeast, and those sent from other parts of the motherland. The most endearing of them was a bright and dazzling red scarf, sent to Zheng Qi by Li Xiuqin, a student at Beijing "August 1st" Elementary School. When the red scarf was taken out for display, Zheng Qi excitedly said: "The children put the red scarf around my neck, called me uncle, and I picked her up... just for this child, we have to fight a few beautiful battles!" I gave Zheng Qi the poster "Peace Representative, Welcome You!" which I had photographed. The author of this painting asked me to bring it when I left Beijing and asked me to give it to the peace defenders on the Korean front on her behalf. Everyone passed it around with great affection, looking at the lovely child running towards them with flowers in their hands, and they all smiled. They felt that this lovely child was welcoming them in the name of the motherland, offering them the flowers of the motherland. We also put the Chairman Mao badge that the friends of the motherland entrusted us to bring, on the bodies of the merit holders of the company. Instructor Su Jingchun said with infinite gratitude: "Motherland, you are really even more dear than our own mother!"
    Writing this, it's nearly midnight, and the hour hand is pointing at eleven o'clock. The enemy planes dropped more than a hundred flares on the opposite bank of our army's position, but the huge roar of our anti-aircraft guns drowned out the enemy planes' whine. The soldiers all know: behind them, across countless rivers and hills, there, enveloping the motherland, is a tranquil and beautiful early spring night. The babies lying in their mothers' arms are sleeping sweetly, and no one has the right to disturb them; the people who have worked hard all day are either asleep or still planning tomorrow's work, and no one has the right to disturb them.
    Now, the footsteps of spring have once again stepped onto this heroic land, and on the fire-scorched mountainsides, saplings have begun to develop. In the peaceful land of the motherland, spring will become even more beautiful. The soldiers of the Iron Company who are guarding here are defending the heroic land of Korea, defending the eternal spring of the motherland.

    保卫祖国永恒的春天
    汪明
    春到朝鲜。志愿军的一个连队正守卫在朝鲜前线的一条大江边上。江河已经开冻，冰块冲击下来，发出哗哗的巨响。这种情景，使我们的战士们怀想起祖国的春天来：松花江开冻的时候，牡丹江开冻的时候，祖国任何一条江河开冻的时候，不也是这样吗？
    “春天到啦！”
    “在我们家乡，这时节油菜开花啦！遍地金黄！”
    “可不是，我们家乡，豌豆苗拔尖哪！”
    正在挖工事的战士们都在谈着春天，谈着祖国春天的诱人的情景。谈到最兴奋的时候，就像孩子似地跳起来，唱起来。
    不久以前战士张绍武收到他母亲的来信，信上说：“现在天气冷，等春天了，我一定带着小素琴照一张像片给你寄来。希望你在朝鲜勇敢杀敌，为人民立功！”这是一封很平常的家信，但是却给远离祖国的人们带来了特别浓厚的温暖的乡土感情。
    “张绍武的妈来信啦，说春天给他捎照片来，还带他的小女儿素琴去照像呢！”收到信的那天，班长孙立清快乐地大声喊着，把信举得高高的。战士们抬起头来，看看这封信，又看看张绍武，大家笑了。好像这封信不是给张绍武一个人写的，而是大家都有份一样。
    现在，春天来了，母亲该去照像了——张绍武想到这里，劳动得更加起劲了，眼睛闪着愉快的光芒。
    一位战士一边挥着镐头一边说：“刨这玩意儿，你说不累，不艰苦，那是假的；但是意义可大哪！别看我们这一镐头，一钻子，一锤子的，可就改变了世界形势。镐头虽小，来头可大，正是这样，咱们祖国就没人敢碰一碰！咱们在这里挖坑道，修坑道，祖国就能进行大规模的建设，张绍武他娘就能带着孙女儿去照像。祖国就是那样的。你看看，前几天运来的抚顺煤，昨天运来的吉林大木料，都是从祖国一车一车运来的呀！我们吃的、穿的、用的，哪样不是祖国来的呢？都是的。我们后边没有个强大的祖国，能办得到吗？办不到，肯定办不到！”他滔滔不绝地谈着，别的战士谁也插不上嘴，大家听着他继续说下去：“我们为祖国打几个漂亮仗，立个特等功，或者一等功，胜利回祖国，祖国的娃娃们喊你一声‘志愿军叔叔’，‘最可爱的人’，那你心里才舒坦呢！”他越说越起劲，使劲一镐头，“卡巴”一声，一大块青石掉了下来……
    这个连队有两个荣誉的称号——“钢铁连”，“突破临津江英雄连”。入朝以来，战云山、破临津、克平壤、下汉城，多少辉煌的胜利，都是和这个英雄连的名字联系着。连队首长们不是英雄就是功臣。因此，连队中的每个战士，都有一种强烈的愿望：“学习连队首长，为祖国立功，当上英雄上北京！”在这个连队的英雄中间，郑起的名字，祖国人民一定是知道的。他是釜谷里战斗中的特等功臣、二级战斗英雄，现在是钢铁连的副指导员。在那次战斗中，他还是司号员，连的干部牺牲了，他就代替指挥，和战友们一起，坚守一个小山头，他的响亮的号声，鼓舞着战友们打退敌人一次又一次的疯狂反扑，最后配合友邻部队，终于获得了胜利。
    “那冲锋号的声音，真是祖国的声音啊！”郑起回忆当时的情景说，“我们都觉得，做一个中国人，做一个钢铁连的战士，就必须是硬梆梆的。”
    有一回，我和钢铁连的营长申明和天南地北地聊起来。营长是个二十三岁的小伙子。他母亲最近从东北来了信，也是一封平常的信，也同样地流露着深沉的慈母的爱和浓厚的乡土感情。母亲告诉他：今年家里做了两床新被子和一身新棉袄；订了生产计划：养两口猪，等猪长肥了，就卖出去一口，再买四口小猪和二十只小鸡。母亲又对他说：“好好打鬼子，立功时捎张喜报回来！”这是母亲的殷切的愿望。儿子回答说：“在下次战斗里，你们看着吧，咱们的营，非得打出个英雄营不可，我要亲自带着钢铁连去打！我们要彻底打垮敌人任何一种冒险进攻，肯定有把握！这样，才不愧是祖国最可爱的人哪！”这是一个指挥员的决心，也是儿子对母亲的宣誓。
    在这里，你随处都感到战士们的心是如何地和祖国息息相通着。不久前，战士们盖起了几栋新房子，每间房子都可以通到阵地。一个小通讯员笑眯眯地对我说：“这新房子旁边的小路，你不信，还可以通到祖国去呢！”他又说：“如果房子里能有一架收音机，多漂亮，天天可以听到祖国讲话！”是的，战士们是如何渴望着听到祖国的声音啊！有时，在一个凑巧的机缘里，战士们能够围坐在一架收音机前，他们就会本能地把波长拨到北京，有人就会用深沉的语调说上一声：“听，祖国……”于是大家就立刻鸦雀无声，竖起耳朵，睁大眼睛，凝神谛听。这时，战士们的每一双眼睛都充满了安谧的愉快的天真的神情，好像偎依在母亲的怀里，听讲一个动人故事的稚气的孩子一样。
    记得春节那天，祖国运来了六十度的烧酒。几个通讯员围着桌子坐下来。他们都是机灵、活泼、爱闹的小伙子，他们喝酒，唱歌，大声谈笑。忽然其中的一个静了下来，把杯子里的酒郑重地点燃，两手托着下巴，眯着眼看着跳动的蓝色的火苗。大家对他叫喊，抗议他的这种浪费，可是他却一声不响。等火熄了，酒精烧掉了，他端起杯子来，把里面剩下的水一口喝掉，站起来，挥着手喊道：“同志们哪，好甜啊！出国两年多，我今天喝到咱们东北的水啦！”
    也是春节那天，钢铁连的同志们把祖国送来的最心爱的东西摆出来，有信，有照片，一大叠一大叠的。有从北京寄来的，有从东北寄来的，还有从祖国其他地方寄来的，其中最逗人爱的，是一条鲜艳耀目的红领巾，这是北京“八一”小学学生李秀琴送给郑起的。当这条红领巾拿出来展览的时候，郑起兴奋地说：“孩子们把红领巾戴在我的脖子上，喊我叔叔，我把她抱起来……就为了这个孩子，我们也得打上几次漂亮仗呀！”我把拍成照片的招贴画“和平代表，欢迎你！”送给了郑起，这是我离开北京时这幅画的作者托我带来的，要我代她送给朝鲜前线的和平保卫者。大家爱不释手地传看着，看着那个举着鲜花的可爱的孩子向着自己奔来，都笑了。他们感到，这个可爱的孩子是以祖国的名义来欢迎他们，把祖国的鲜花献给他们的。我们又把祖国的朋友们托我们带来的毛主席像纪念章，戴在连队功臣们的身上。指导员苏景春无限感激地说：“祖国啊，你真是比亲娘还亲！”
    写到这里，已近午夜，时针正指着十一点。敌机在我军阵地对岸投下一百多颗照明弹，可是我们的高射炮的巨大轰响，盖过了敌机的啸声。战士们都知道：在自己的背后，越过无数的河流和山岗，在那里，笼罩着祖国的是恬静而优美的早春之夜。那躺在母亲怀里的婴儿睡得正甜，谁也没有权利去干扰他们；那辛勤了一天的人们，或者已经入睡，或者还在计划着明天的工作，谁也没有权利去干扰他们。
    现在，春天的脚步又踏上了这英雄的土地，在被战火灼伤的山腰上，小树已开始灌浆了。在祖国和平的土地上，春天将变得更加美丽。守卫在这里的钢铁连的战士们，正在保卫着朝鲜英雄的土地，保卫着祖国永恒的春天。
