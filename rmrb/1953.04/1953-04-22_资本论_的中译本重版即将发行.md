Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The Chinese translation of Marx's great work "Das Kapital" will soon be republished by People's Publishing House and distributed by Xinhua Bookstore. The translation will be in a 25-open format, finely bound in blue silk. The entire book consists of more than 3,000 pages, divided into three volumes, to be published in three installments this year. Due to printing limitations, the first volume will be published in two batches, in May and July. Xinhua Bookstore has decided to take pre-orders in major cities across the country from May 2nd to 10th. Before 1938, there were some individually translated chapters and sections of the Chinese translation of "Das Kapital." These partial translations were selected and translated by many people, and they were not complete. The writing style and the translation of terms were also inconsistent. In 1938, the complete three-volume translation co-translated by Guo Dali and Wang Yanan was published by Dushu Shenghuo Publishing House, and this great work was then completely introduced to China. Since 1938, this translation has been reprinted six or seven times, totaling approximately 30,000 copies. This republication has been revised by the original translators to correct some errors in the translation, re-translate some terms, and completely re-translate certain paragraphs.

    “资本论”的中译本重版即将发行
    【新华社二十一日讯】马克思的伟大著作“资本论”的中译本，最近将由人民出版社重版，由新华书店发行。译本为二十五开本，以蓝色绢面精装。全书共三千多页，分三大卷，在今年年内分三次出齐。第一卷因印刷条件的限制，在五月和七月分两批出版。新华书店决定在五月二日到十日在全国各大城市办理预订。“资本论”的中译本，在一九三八年以前曾有过一些单章单节的分译本。这些分译本是由很多人选译的，并不完全，在译笔的格调和名词的翻译上也不统一。到一九三八年，郭大力和王亚南合译的三卷全译本由读书生活出版社出版后，这一巨著才被完整地介绍到中国来。自一九三八年以后，该译本曾陆续再版了六、七次，共约三万部左右。这次重版，由原译者改正了一些译文上的错误，改译了一些名词，并整段重译了某些段落。
