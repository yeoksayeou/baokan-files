Xinhua News Agency, April 14th dispatch:
    Moscow News: Soviet agricultural workers continue to actively engage in spring plowing. This year's spring planting in the Soviet Union is proceeding particularly quickly, due to the increased level of agricultural mechanization and the greater enthusiasm of agricultural workers in the competition. The new "Stalin-80" tractor, widely used this year for spring planting, has 93 horsepower and can pull five seeders simultaneously, sowing seeds on a 20-meter (6 Chinese 'zhang') wide strip of land in one pass. Currently, Soviet spring planting has expanded from the southern regions to the White Russian and Baltic Republics, Siberia, and the central European region of the Soviet Union. The Moldavian Republic and the Crimean and North Caucasus states have all completed their sowing plans for wheat and rye. In Kuban, the famous Soviet grain-producing region, many collective farms completed their grain spring planting plans in just three or four days in a competition to welcome "May Day." This spring, the number of tractor teams in Kuban that completed their grain sowing plans within two working days has increased by two hundred compared to last spring. The "May Day" competition is also enthusiastically unfolding among agricultural workers in the famous granary of the Ukrainian Republic. The Genichesk District of Kherson Oblast completed the district's grain spring planting in just two and a half days; the Natieyev tractor team of the Dzhurubinsk District completes one and a half work quotas every day.
    Many Soviet collective farms and state farms are planting industrial crops such as sugar beets, flax, sunflowers, and cotton. In the planting of sugar beets and flax, this year will not only greatly expand the planting area but will also pay special attention to selecting superior varieties. More than three-quarters of the already sown flax fields are planted with high-yielding new varieties. Soviet agricultural workers have put forward many guarantees for a bumper harvest of industrial crops in the "May Day" competition. In Ukraine, the Sharikova team of the "Red Guards" State Farm in Chkalov Oblast guarantees to adopt the most advanced agricultural techniques to make the yield of sugar beets exceed 100,000 kilograms per hectare.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th dispatch: According to the Polish News Agency in Warsaw: Poland's spring plowing work has already achieved great success. Many state farms and cooperative farms in the southwestern provinces, as well as many villages, have completed the sowing of the main grains, and the spring plowing work in the central and southern provinces is vigorously underway. This year's spring plowing in all provinces started earlier than last year, and the climatic conditions are also better than last year. It is expected that the sowing of the main spring crops nationwide will be completed earlier than last year.
    In the spring plowing in various provinces of Poland, state farms and cooperative farms are playing a leading and exemplary role. Under the leadership of agricultural workers and cooperative farmers, thousands of farmers are participating in the labor competition to strive for rapid, timely, and correct spring plowing, to strive for the full realization of production potential, and to strive for increased productivity.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th dispatch: According to TASS in Budapest: Spring plowing work is being carried out enthusiastically throughout Hungary. The Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture announced that the spring wheat sowing plan had been completed before March 20th. The sowing area of spring wheat has increased eightfold compared to the past few years. Fertilization plans have also been completed throughout the country. This year, the fertilized area has doubled compared to last year. The work of planting sugar beets (raw materials for sugar production) is nearing completion. Cotton planting has begun in various regions. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a circular to the staff of agricultural production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and individual farmers, calling on them to complete the planting of sugar beets and cotton before April 15th.
    In carrying out spring plowing work, machine tractor stations are vigorously helping agricultural production cooperatives. Two hundred and sixty-one machine tractor stations, hundreds of work teams, and thousands of tractor drivers are working hard to fulfill their production guarantees to agricultural production cooperatives. By the 7th, one hundred and forty-five machine tractor stations had completed and exceeded their plans.

    农业机械化水平日益提高，农业劳动者展开竞赛
    苏联今年春季播种进行得很快
    波兰匈牙利春耕工作都已获得很大成就
    【新华社十四日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联农业劳动者继续积极进行春耕。今年苏联春播进行得特别快，这是由于农业机械化水平更加提高和农业劳动者在竞赛中发挥了更大的积极性。今年春播大批使用的“斯大林—八十号”新式拖拉机，拥有九十三匹马力，能同时曳引五台播种机，每走一趟就使二十公尺（合六市丈）宽的土地播了种。现在，苏联春播已由南部地区扩展到白俄罗斯和波罗的海区各加盟共和国、西伯利亚和苏联欧洲中部地区。摩尔达维亚共和国和克里米亚、北高加索各州都已完成了小麦和裸麦播种计划。在苏联著名的产谷区库班，许多集体农庄在迎接“五一”节的竞赛中只用三、四天就完成了谷物春播计划。今年春天，库班在两个工作日以内完成谷物播种计划的拖拉机工作队，比去年春天增加了二百队。“五一”竞赛也在苏联著名谷仓乌克兰共和国的农业劳动者中间热烈展开。刻松州格尼契斯克区仅仅用了两天半便完成了全区的谷物春播；久鲁宾斯克区的纳捷耶夫拖拉机工作队每天完成一个半工作定额。
    苏联许多集体农庄和国营农场正在播种甜菜、亚麻、向日葵、棉花等工业作物。在甜菜和亚麻种植方面，今年不仅要大大扩展其种植面积而且特别注意选用优良品种。在已播种的亚麻田中，有四分之三以上播的是产量很高的新品种。苏联农业劳动者在“五一”竞赛中提出了许多使工业作物丰收的保证。在乌克兰，契卡洛夫州“赤卫队”国营农场沙里科娃小组保证采用最先进的农业技术，使每公顷甜菜产量超过十万公斤。
    【新华社十四日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰今年的春耕工作已经获得很大成就。西南各省的许多国营农场和合作社农场以及许多乡村已经完成了主要谷物的播种工作，中部和南部各省的春耕工作正在大力进行中。今年各省春耕都比去年开始得早，而且气候条件也比去年好，预料全国主要春季作物的播种工作将比去年提前完成。
    在波兰各省的春耕中，国营农场和合作社农场起着带头和榜样的作用。在农业工人和合作社农民的带领下，千千万万的农民参加了争取迅速、及时和正确地进行春耕、争取充分发挥生产潜力和争取提高生产率的劳动竞赛。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利全国各地正在热烈地进行春耕工作。匈牙利农业部宣布，春小麦播种计划已在三月二十日以前完成。春小麦的播种面积和过去几年相比已增加到八倍。全国各地并已完成了施肥计划，今年，施肥的面积比去年增加了一倍。种植甜菜（制糖原料）的工作即将结束。各地区已开始种植棉花。农业部向农业生产合作社、机器拖拉机站的工作人员和个体农民发出通告，号召他们在四月十五日以前完成甜菜和棉花的种植工作。
    在进行春耕工作中，机器拖拉机站大力帮助农业生产合作社。二百六十一个机器拖拉机站，几百个工作小组和几千个拖拉机手正在为实行他们对农业生产合作社的生产保证而努力。到七日，完成和超额完成计划的机器拖拉机站已有一百四十五个。
