    Neglecting Production Will Cause Serious Mistakes
    The leading cadres of the Datong Mining Bureau have relaxed their leadership over production. None of the five directors and deputy directors is specifically responsible for leading production. Cadres remaining in production posts, seeing others being transferred to capital construction, have also become emotionally unstable. Consequently, production problems are not being addressed and resolved seriously, leading to the failure to complete production tasks. This is a very harmful tendency.
    The state's call to place capital construction in a primary position does not mean that production can be relaxed or that production tasks do not need to be completed. On the contrary, with the commencement of large-scale economic construction, the responsibilities borne by industrial production are even greater. This is because: first, if production tasks are not completed, capital construction tasks will be directly affected. Capital construction cannot be started from scratch; it needs to rely on existing factories and mines to supply machinery, equipment, power, and raw materials. If raw materials, power, and machinery are not supplied, capital construction tasks simply cannot be completed.
    Second, the main source of our country's construction funds relies on internal accumulation, and existing factories and mines bear a significant responsibility in this regard. If the leading cadres and workers of existing factories and mines relax production tasks, fail to complete production plans, resulting in high product costs, low quality, and serious waste, they will not be able to complete the task of accumulating funds for the state.
    Third, we have now built many new factories and mines. The management personnel and technicians of these new factories and mines after they start production will mainly rely on existing factories and mines to train and transfer them. In order to manage those newer, more modern factories and mines well in the future, it is even more necessary to consciously and unremittingly improve our management and technical levels from now on. Taking Datong Coal Mine as an example, if the current combined mining machine working face is not well managed, and regular cyclic operations are not implemented according to the indicated charts, what will happen when the new mine is successfully built in the future? Can our new mines still remain at a backward technical level, and can production still be carried out blindly and without a plan?
    Fourth, with the development of the national economy, the people's living requirements will increase day by day. In order to meet the people's growing needs as much as possible, it is even more important for light industry and local industries to do a good job in current production work. We must not only increase output but also improve quality and reduce costs. Therefore, all enterprise leading cadres should promptly correct and prevent the tendency to neglect production, immediately clear their minds, and earnestly strengthen their leadership over production.

### 忽视生产将造成严重的错误

    忽视生产将造成严重的错误
    大同矿务局领导干部放松对生产的领导，五位正副局长中没有一个人专门负责领导生产；留在生产岗位上的干部看到别人被抽调到基本建设方面去，情绪也波动起来，于是，生产中的问题无人负责认真解决，以致生产任务完不成。这是一种十分有害的倾向。
    国家号召把基本建设放在首要地位，并不是说就可以放松生产，就可以不完成生产任务了。相反地，大规模的经济建设开始以后，工业生产方面所担负的责任更重了。因为：第一，生产任务完不成，基本建设任务就会直接受到影响。搞基本建设不是可以白手起家的，它需要依靠现有的生产厂矿供应机械设备、动力和原材料。原材料、动力、机械设备供应不上，基本建设任务就根本无法完成。
    第二，我们国家建设资金的主要来源要靠内部积累，而现有的生产厂矿在这方面担有重大的任务。现有生产厂矿的领导干部和职工，如果放松了生产任务，使生产计划完不成，产品的成本很高，质量很低，造成严重浪费，就不能完成为国家积累资金的任务。
    第三，我们现在新建了很多厂矿，这些新建厂矿开始生产后的管理人员和技术工人，将主要的要依靠现有厂矿培养输送。为了将来管理好那些更新的、现代化的工厂矿山，就更需要从现在起就自觉地不懈地提高自己的管理水平和技术水平。就以大同煤矿来说，现在的康拜因机工作面搞不好，不能按指示图表实行正规循环作业，将来新的矿井建设成功以后怎么办呢？难道我们的新矿井还能够停留在落后的技术水平，生产还能够盲目无计划地进行吗？
    第四，随着国家经济的发展，群众的生活要求将日益提高。为着要尽可能地满足群众这个日益增长的需要，对于轻工业和地方工业来说，搞好目前的生产工作，就更为重要，我们不但要增加产量，还要提高质量，降低成本。因此，所有的企业领导干部都应该及时纠正和防止忽视生产的倾向，立即使自己的头脑清醒起来，切实加强对生产的领导。
