Zhaizhuang Township, 14th District, Laixi County, Shandong Province, handled a letter of complaint from military personnel Zhou Kuiyun and Li Mingzhi of Dongzhaizhuang against Party member Zhou Zhenggang through the People's Representative Meeting. This raised ideological awareness within and outside the Party, promoted democracy, improved relations between the Party and the masses, consolidated the people's democratic government, and powerfully promoted spring ploughing production.

After the liberation of Dongzhaizhuang, Zhaizhuang Township, in 1945, the masses, under the leadership of the Party, overthrew feudal forces, obtained land, and raised their awareness. However, the Party members of the village branch were not highly aware, and the class boundaries were unclear. They rashly listened to the opinions of a few people and wrongly struggled against and wrongly controlled family members of military personnel. Moreover, they had a purely task-oriented viewpoint and commandism in their work, seriously alienating themselves from family members of military personnel and the masses. Zhou Zhengsu (a poor peasant who had been a bandit in the old society, and the masses were dissatisfied with him), a family member of military personnel, had been struggled against and beaten by village cadre Zhou Zhenggang and others in 1947, so he held a grudge against Zhou Zhenggang; and said in front of Zhou Zhenggang: "It has to be white knives in and red knives out with you." In 1949, when the call to join the army was issued, the District Committee forcibly assigned the village the task of mobilizing twenty new soldiers. Therefore, the village cadres spread the word among the masses: "You have to go, and if you don't go, we'll use poles to knock you." As a result, although the task was completed, it caused great dissatisfaction among the family members of military personnel. Zhou Zhengsu took the opportunity to hold five meetings of family members of military personnel, launching an attack on the cadres and preparing to kill Zhou Zhenggang. Among the 29 families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers in the village, 20 had opinions about the cadres. Zhou Zhenggang and others, seeing that Zhou Zhengsu was privately holding meetings of family members of military personnel to deal with the cadres, became even more hostile to him and wanted to find a way to retaliate. The District Committee was seriously bureaucratic and mistakenly supported the village cadres. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Zhou Zhengsu and his wife, daughter, and son were placed under control. At that time, Zhou Zhengsu felt that there was no way out, bought half a catty of arsenic, and prepared to poison his entire family of eight. Fortunately, the People's Government discovered this, immediately announced the lifting of his control, and saved them. However, the village cadres' hatred for Zhou Zhengsu deepened. A family member of military personnel, because his son died of illness in the army, went to Zhou Zhenggang to fight, saying: "My son was forced out by you and died outside. Today I will fight you to the death!" and slapped Zhou Zhenggang twice. The morale of the village cadres was generally low. They said: "Work is impossible to do, it's thankless, we only get dirty gas, scolded and beaten." Some people, dissatisfied with the cadres' coercive orders, said when they saw the family members of military personnel beat the cadres: "Hitting them twice isn't much, it really relieves my hatred." Some people felt that this was wrong, and that they shouldn't hit the cadres no matter what. Most people reflected: "Chairman Mao led us to turn over and have food and clothing, but we are still not harmonious. If we can be harmonious and discuss things together, production will be more vigorous and life will be better." The above-mentioned disputes directly affected the consolidation of the people's democratic government in the village and became an obstacle to the development of production. After several movements and Party rectification, they had not been completely resolved.

In order to correctly handle the complaint of military personnel Zhou Kuiyun and others, solve the above-mentioned problems in the village, and promote production, the leading organs of Laixi County sent an inspection team to work in the village. As soon as the inspection team arrived in the village, they saw that the masses' enthusiasm for production was not high, and the cadres' enthusiasm for work was not high. After discussions and visits, they found that the key to hindering production development was the disunity between cadres and family members of military personnel and the commandist style of the cadres, and found that solving this problem was the urgent requirement of cadres and family members of military personnel as well as the broad masses. The inspection team seized this key issue, conducted further visits among the masses, and separately convened cadres and family members of military personnel for discussions, found the root causes of their disunity, and enlightened them to solve the problem with the correct attitude, clarify the case, and distinguish the nature. Zhou Zhengsu said: "If the problem is not solved, I will not be able to work with peace of mind; as long as we can exchange opinions, I hope that the cadres will not hate me in the future." Zhou Zhenggang said: "If the family members of military personnel cannot be united, the work will be awkward, thankless, scolded and beaten. If everyone can unite, the work will be easy to do, and we can have the energy to lead production."

The inspection team then seized the key, prescribed the right medicine, carried out class education and unity production education, and used the method of criticism and self-criticism to enlighten everyone to automatically untie the "knots." The specific approach was to enlighten people with the question of "why is there no enthusiasm for production," to educate the cadres on the people's democratic dictatorship and serving the masses, to calculate the pros and cons of disunity among family members, and to explain the principle that "if the family members of military personnel do not live in peace, the soldiers will not be at ease in the army." For family members of military personnel, they compared and explained the relationship between unity or disagreement and production and life, so that they could understand the harm of disunity among family members and the benefits of unity and production. Through education, the ideological awareness of the cadres was raised, so that everyone realized their mistakes, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out at the Party branch meeting. At the same time, family members of military personnel such as Zhou Zhengsu were comforted and educated, explaining that disunity between cadres and family members of military personnel was beneficial to the enemy and harmful to the revolution. On the basis of jointly raising awareness, Zhou Zhenggang and others personally apologized to Zhou Zhengsu, exchanged opinions with each other, initially broke the estrangement, and expressed that they would definitely unite in the future. In the exchange of opinions, Zhou Zhenggang reviewed and said: "In the past, I didn't know who was revolutionary, whose revolution to make, the more opinions you had of me, the more I hated you, one family did not recognize another family, this is not right, this is beneficial to the evil landlords, in the future we must unite the family members of military personnel well." Zhou Zhengsu said: "Since you beat me in 1947, coupled with the villains picking on us, I have remembered the hatred with you. The more you hate me, the more I hate you, this is what the villains want. Cadres are revolutionary, and my son is also revolutionary outside. In the past, we didn't have common language; now that the words are spoken and the water is cleared, there is nothing. I cannot be an enemy of my own children. Let's write off the past and start over. In the future, if I have problems, you will give me advice, if you have problems, I will give you advice, our own brothers and fathers will unite and live a good life."

In order to further consolidate unity, thoroughly solve the problem, further educate Party members and cadres, raise mass awareness, and closely connect the Party with the masses, and powerfully implement spring ploughing production, the inspection team helped the township convene a township People's Representative Meeting with leadership and preparation. Representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, labor models, and activists were invited to participate in the meeting. Party members and cadres who were not representatives also attended, totaling more than 70 people. The meeting widely promoted democracy and carried out criticism and self-criticism. First, it explained the importance of the people's letters, made a report on the investigation of the case, analyzed the nature of the problem and its harmfulness, and explained that this was the key to insufficient enthusiasm for production and lack of confidence in leading production. Then, Zhou Zhenggang made a public review. Wang Renshou, the District Head of the district, also checked the bureaucratic and commandist mistakes of the District Committee and their evil consequences on behalf of the District Committee. Then, the representatives were asked to discuss separately and put forward opinions on how to deal with the matter. When speaking at the conference, Zhou Zhenggang said: "The representatives helped to improve me, so that I further realized who is revolutionary, whose revolution to make, and realized that it is wrong to attack the families of military personnel. The power of the people is great, and they helped me solve the old problem of several years. I will definitely do a good job in the future." Zhou Piling, a member of the branch committee, said: "This meeting educated me, and I know that the revolution must distinguish between family members and outsiders. Today's good life was won by the troops, and cadres should lead the masses to solve difficulties for the families of military personnel. It is very wrong to hate each other." Zhou Zhengsu said: "In the past, I had opinions on the cadres and only thought of ways to deal with the cadres, which was wrong. I am really happy to have this meeting, and I am determined to respond to the call of the Communist Party in the future and follow Chairman Mao." Representative Zhang Weiyi said: "It is really the world of the people, and we discuss our own problems ourselves. The problems of Zhou Zhenggang and Zhou Zhengsu are our own internal affairs, as long as we realize that the past was wrong and make a review, it will be fine." Some representatives said: "In the past, some people secretly laughed when they saw the families of military personnel beating cadres, which was their own people laughing at their own people's jokes; in the future, we must unite everyone and discuss things together." Finally, the leadership summarized according to the opinions of the representatives, unified everyone's understanding and handling opinions (no punishment was given). On this basis, the spring ploughing production work was specifically arranged, and the representatives were called upon to cooperate with the cadres to mobilize the masses and use the new strength of unity to spring ploughing production.

After the problem was resolved, the masses' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and the cadres' enthusiasm for leading production was also improved. The masses generally reflected that "Dongzhaizhuang has changed." Everyone was very grateful to the inspection team, and some wanted to invite the comrades of the inspection team to their homes for dinner. The village has a total of 146 households and 650 mu of spring land, which has now been completely raked. More than 8,000 truckloads of soil have been pushed. Female Party member Liu Meixiang and three members of the Communist Youth League led 34 women to hoe in the paddy fields. The village has now hoed 310 mu of wheat, which is unprecedented. After the problem was solved, Zhou Zhengsu no longer frowned, was in high spirits, and said to everyone he met: "I peel flax until midnight every night, and I go to the mountains early the next morning. It's really a pleasure to work, and it feels like a big rock has been removed from my body." He wrote a letter to his son, saying that he and the cadres had reconciled, and told his son to study with peace of mind at the front and be determined to defend the country; at the same time, he voluntarily withdrew 5 mu of land cultivated on his behalf and cultivated it himself, reducing the burden on the masses.

Through the handling of this incident, everyone realized the following points:

1. The handling of the people's letters must be combined with the central work, especially since the current period is the tense period of spring ploughing and spring planting. If it cannot be handled through production and does not help production, then the practical significance of handling the people's letters will be lost. Zhaizhuang Township has always grasped this point from the beginning to the end, so it has received good results.

2. The handling of the people's letters must adopt an objective, calm, and realistic attitude and a thorough and meticulous working style. Through work, we must conduct in-depth investigations, clarify the facts of the case, and distinguish the nature; we must strictly distinguish between the rule of the masses by bad elements and the internal disputes of the people, and we must never set fires everywhere and attack people indiscriminately. In addition to severely punishing lawless elements who have personal purposes, extort and blackmail, rape women, frame the masses, and commit all kinds of evil, cadres who have committed general errors of coercion and policy errors due to work should be treated with the attitude of curing diseases and saving people, and given education and transformation.

3. Using the working method of the mass line, handling the internal problems of the people through the People's Representative Meeting can not only clear production obstacles, implement the central work, correctly handle the people's reflections and demands, consolidate the people's democratic system, expand political influence, and further gain the people's trust; at the same time, it is also a new method of handling the current people's letters and solving the problem of "few people and many things." However, this kind of meeting should not be convened alone, but must be combined with the representative meeting for implementing work. Before the meeting, we must conduct a good investigation of the case, widely promote democracy and carry out criticism and self-criticism during the meeting, and after the meeting, we must be good at giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses and organize forces to do a good job in spring ploughing production.

    山东莱西县寨庄乡通过人民代表会议处理人民来信
    增强了人民内部团结推动了春耕生产
    山东省莱西县十四区寨庄乡通过人民代表会议，处理了“东寨庄军人周魁云、李铭志控诉该村党员干部周正岗”的来信，提高了党内外的思想觉悟，发扬了民主，改善了党与群众的关系，巩固了人民民主政权，有力地推动了春耕生产工作。
    寨庄乡东寨庄于一九四五年解放后，群众在党的领导下，打倒了封建势力，得到了土地，提高了觉悟。但该村支部的党员觉悟不高，阶级界限不清，曾轻率地听信了少数群众的意见，错斗争、错管制了军属，而且在工作中有单纯的任务观点、命令主义，严重地脱离了军属和群众。军属周正素（贫农，在旧社会里曾当过土匪，群众对他不满）在一九四七年曾被村干部周正岗等带领群众斗争过，遭到毒打，故对周正岗怀恨在心；并在周正岗面前讲：“非和你白刀子进去红刀子出来不可。”一九四九年号召参军时，该区区委会硬性派给该村动员二十名新兵的任务。因此，村干部就在群众中扬风：“去也得去，不去使杠子敲去。”结果虽将任务完成，但造成军属很大不满。周正素并乘机召开五次军属会，发动军属向干部进攻，准备打死周正岗。全村二十九户烈属军属工属中，有二十户对干部有意见。周正岗等见周正素私开军属会对付干部，更加对其仇视，要想办法进行报复。该区区委会官僚主义严重，错误地支持村干部，在镇压反革命时，将周正素和其妻、女、子等人管制起来。当时周正素感到无路可走，买了半斤砷石，准备全家八口服毒自杀。幸被人民政府发觉，立即宣布解除其管制，始得救。但村干部对周正素的仇恨就更加深了。有个军属因自己儿子在部队里病死了，便去找周正岗拚命，说：“俺儿硬叫你逼出去，死在外面，今天非和你拚不可。”并打了周正岗两个耳光。村干部情绪普遍低落，他们说：“工作没法干，出力不讨好，净受肮脏气，挨骂还挨打。”有些人因对干部的强迫命令作风不满，见军属打了干部，还说：“打两下不多，真给我解恨。”也有人觉得这事不对，认为无论如何不该动手打干部。多数人反映：“毛主席领导咱翻身有了吃穿，就是咱还不和顺，如果能和和顺顺有事大家商量着办，生产会更起劲，日子会过得更好。”上述纠纷直接影响到该村人民民主政权的巩固，成为发展生产的障碍。经过多次运动和整党，都未能彻底解决。
    莱西县领导机关为正确处理军人周魁云等的控告，解决该村上述问题，推进生产，特派检查组到村工作。检查组一到该村，就看到群众生产劲头不大，干部工作积极性不高。经过座谈和访问，发现了妨碍生产发展的关键在于干部和军属不团结以及干部有命令主义作风，并发现解决这一问题是干部和军属以及广大群众的迫切要求。检查组抓住这一关键性的问题，在群众中作进一步的访问，同时分头召集干部与军属座谈，找到他们闹不团结的病根，即启发他们以正确的态度解决问题，将案情弄清，性质分清。周正素说：“问题不解决，干活不安心；只要能交换开意见，往后干部再不仇视俺就行了。”周正岗说：“军属团结不了，工作就蹩扭，出力不讨好，挨骂还挨打。大家若能团结起来，工作就好干了，领导生产才能有劲头。”
    检查组接着就抓住关键，对症下药，进行阶级教育与团结生产的教育，运用批评与自我批评的方法，启发大家自动解“疙瘩”。具体的做法是以“生产为什么没劲头”的问题进行启发，对干部进行人民民主专政与为群众服务的教育，算自家人闹不团结的利害账，说明“军属的日子过不安，战士在部队也不坦然”的道理。对军属则对比着说明团结或闹意见对生产与过日子的关系，使其了解自家人不团结的害处和团结生产的好处。通过教育，提高了干部的思想觉悟，使大家认识了错误，在党支部大会上展开批评与自我批评。同时对周正素等军属进行安慰和教育，说明干部和军属不团结，是对敌人有利，对革命有害的。在共同提高觉悟的基础上，周正岗等亲自到周正素面前道歉，互相交换了意见，初步打破了隔阂，表示今后定要团结。在交换意见中，周正岗检讨说：“过去不认识谁革命，革谁的命，您越对我有意见，我就越仇视您，一家人不认一家人，这是不对的，这样对恶霸地主有利，往后一定好好团结军属。”周正素说：“自从一九四七年你打了我，加上坏蛋从中给咱挑拨，我就和你记下了仇。你越仇视我，我就越恨你，这样就称了坏蛋们的心。干部是革命，我儿在外也是革命。过去都是话不投机；如今话说开，水拨开，就没有什么啦。我不能和俺自己的孩子为敌。过去的事一笔勾销，咱从头另来。以后我有了毛病你给我提，你有了毛病我就给你提，自己弟兄爷们好好团结过日子。”
    为了进一步巩固团结，彻底解决问题，进一步教育党员干部，提高群众认识，密切党与群众的联系，有力地贯彻春耕生产，检查组有领导有准备地帮助乡上召开了乡人民代表会议。会议吸收烈属军属代表、劳动模范、积极分子等参加。不是代表的党员干部也都列席，共七十多人。会议广泛发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评。首先讲明了人民来信的重要意义，作了案情调查报告，分析了问题的性质及其危害性，说明这就是生产劲头不足和领导生产无信心的关键所在。继由周正岗作了公开检讨。该区区长王仁寿也代表区委会检查了官僚主义、命令主义的错误及其恶果。然后让代表分头讨论，提出处理意见。在大会发言时，周正岗说：“代表帮助提高了我，使我更进一步认识到谁是革命的，革谁的命，认识到打击军属是不对的。人民的力量大，帮助我把好几年的老问题解决了，今后一定好好干。”支部委员周丕令说：“这次会议教育了我，我知道革命要分清家里人和家外人。今天的好日子是部队给打下的，当干部的应该领导群众给军属解决困难，互相仇视是很不对的。”周正素说：“过去对干部有意见，光想办法对付干部，这是不对的。开这次会我心里真高兴，今后坚决响应共产党的号召，决心跟毛主席走。”代表张维义说：“真是人民的天下，自己的问题自己商量着办，周正岗和周正素的问题是咱自己内部的事，只要认识了过去不对，作了检讨就行了。”有的代表说：“过去有些人见军属打干部，偷着笑，这是自己人看自己人的笑话；今后要大家团结，有事大家商量着办。”最后领导方面根据代表的意见，进行总结，统一了大家的认识和处理意见（不给处分）。在此基础上，具体布置了春耕生产工作，号召代表协同干部发动群众，把团结的新力量用到春耕生产上去。
    问题处理以后，群众生产情绪空前高涨，干部领导生产的积极性也提高了。群众普遍反映“东寨庄变了样”。大家对检查组非常感谢，有的要请检查组同志到他家去吃饭。全村一百四十六户，共有春地六百五十亩，现已全部耙耢完。共推土八千余车。女党员刘美香和三个青年团员带领三十四名妇女下泊锄地，现全村已锄小麦三百一十亩，这是从来未有的事情。周正素在问题解决后，眉头上再不结“疙瘩”了，情绪很高，一见人就说：“我每晚扒麻到半夜，第二天一早就上山，干起活来真痛快，身上好像掀去块大石头。”他一面写信给儿子，说他和干部已经和好了，嘱咐儿子在前方安心学习，决心保家卫国；一面又主动抽回五亩代耕地自己耕种，减轻群众负担。
    经过这一事件的处理，大家体会到以下几点：
    一、处理人民来信必须与中心工作结合，特别是当前正值春耕春种的紧张时期，如不能通过生产进行处理，并有助于生产，那便失掉了处理人民来信的现实意义。寨庄乡从开始到最后，始终掌握了这一点，因而收到了良好的效果。
    二、处理人民来信必须采取客观、冷静、实事求是的态度和深入细致的工作作风。要通过工作深入调查，弄清案情，分清性质；要把坏分子统治群众和人民内部的纠纷严格区分开，决不可到处点火，乱打击人。除对怀有个人目的、敲诈勒索、强奸妇女、陷害群众、无恶不作的违法乱纪分子应予严惩外，对于因工作而犯有一般强迫命令错误和政策错误的干部，应抱治病救人的态度，予以教育改造。
    三、运用群众路线的工作方法，通过人民代表会议处理人民内部问题，不仅能扫清生产障碍，贯彻中心工作，正确处理人民的反映与要求，巩固人民民主制度，扩大政治影响，进一步取得人民信任；同时也是处理当前人民来信、解决“人少事繁”的新方法。但这种会议不应单独召开，而必须与贯彻工作的代表会议相结合。会前要作好案情调查，会议中要广泛发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，会后要善于发挥群众的积极性，组织力量搞好春耕生产。
