Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 11th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Armistice Talks issued the following communiqué on April 11th:

    The agreement between both sides on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war was signed at the sixth meeting of the liaison groups of both sides at Panmunjom on April 11th.

    Prior to the signing, General Li Sang-cho, chief member of our side's liaison group, emphasized: Our side has consistently advocated and will implement the full repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war under our custody, but the other side has stated that they will invoke Article 109, paragraph 3, of the Geneva Convention and only repatriate a portion of the sick and wounded prisoners of war under their custody. Regarding this, our side believes it must be stated that, concerning any of our sick and wounded prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated this time, our side reserves the right to demand that they be handed over to a neutral country so that a fair resolution can be obtained on the issue of their repatriation after the armistice.

    After the signing, General Li Sang-cho suggested that the liaison groups of both sides should immediately begin discussions on the date for the resumption of meetings of the delegations of both sides. General Li Sang-cho pointed out that our commander had stated in his letter to the other side's commander on March 28th that a reasonable solution to the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war between both sides during the war should lead to a smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue. This view has also been agreed to by the other side's commander. Now that both sides have signed an agreement on the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, our side has further put forward a new proposal for resolving the entire prisoner of war issue and has fully explained it. Our side believes that the plenary session of the delegations of both sides should resume immediately to discuss and resolve the entire prisoner of war issue in order to achieve an armistice in Korea. The other side stated that they would consider the issue of resuming the delegation meeting and respond later.

    General Li Sang-cho reiterated his hope that the liaison groups of both sides would reconvene in one or two days to make a decision on this issue. The other side agreed.

    At the meeting of officers from the liaison groups of both sides on the afternoon of April 11th, our side stated that it could basically agree to the draft of the mutual understanding on the administrative details regarding the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war proposed by the other side on April 10th, but proposed necessary amendments and additions to certain specific matters stipulated therein. The other side stated that they would study our side's amendments.

    朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团发表公报遣返病伤战俘协定签字
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月十一日发表公报如下：
    双方关于遣返病伤被俘人员协定已于四月十一日在板门店双方联络组第六次会议上签字。
    签字前我方联络组首席组员李相朝将军着重指出：我方一贯主张并即将实行全部遣返我方收容下的病伤战俘，但对方则声明对方将援引日内瓦公约第一零九条第三项的规定，只遣返对方所收容的一部分病伤战俘。对此我方认为必须声明：关于凡此次未被直接遣返的我方病伤被俘人员，我方保留权利提出将他们交给中立国的要求，以便对他们在停战后的遣返问题取得公正的解决。
    签字后，李相朝将军建议双方联络组应立即进入双方代表团复会日期的讨论。李相朝将军指出，我方司令官在三月二十八日给对方司令官的信中即已表示在战争期间交换双方病伤战俘的问题的合理解决，应该使之引导到全部战俘问题的顺利解决。这一意见并已得到对方司令官的同意。现在双方既已签订了遣返病伤战俘的协定，我方更提出了解决整个战俘问题的新的建议，并对此作了完全的说明。我方认为双方代表团大会应立即复会，讨论并解决全部战俘问题以实现朝鲜停战。对方表示对代表团大会的复会问题将于考虑后再作答复。
    李相朝将军再次表示希望双方联络组在一、两天内复会，就这一问题作出决定。对方表示同意。
    在四月十一日下午的双方联络组军官会议上，我方表示对方四月十日提出的双方关于遣返病伤被俘人员的行政细节之谅解的草案，基本上可以同意，但对其中所规定的若干具体事项提出必要的修改和补充。对方表示将对我方的修正案加以研究。
