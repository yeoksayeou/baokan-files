Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: The motorcade carrying the first batch of Korean POWs who are sick and wounded and will be repatriated by the Korean-Chinese side arrived in Kaesong on the afternoon of the 16th. Our side will begin repatriating sick and wounded POWs to the US side on the 20th. On the first day of repatriation, 50 percent of the repatriated will be Korean POWs, and 50 percent will be non-Korean POWs.

Although these sick and wounded POWs who arrived today had traveled a long distance of more than 500 kilometers, they did not appear tired because they were well taken care of along the way.

Before the arrival of these sick and wounded POWs, the temporary hospital prepared by the Goryeo School to accommodate them was fully ready. Medical personnel in spotless white coats could be seen everywhere in the hospital. The consulting rooms were clean and tidy and had been strictly disinfected. Each ward was decorated with yellow forsythia and light purple azaleas. If it weren't for the surrounding ruins and bullet marks on the walls, this would truly be a comfortable and peaceful hospital.

However, the US side's treatment of our sick and wounded captured personnel to be repatriated is in stark contrast to our side's humanitarian treatment of POWs. Yesterday, British and American news agencies revealed that seven hundred sick and wounded captured volunteers requested "better treatment from UN guards" en route from Jeju Island to Busan. The American army even resorted to the old tactics of Geoje Island and Jeju Island, using bayonets and poison gas to threaten and oppress our captured personnel.

### 我方准备首批遣返的病伤战俘已到达开城

    我方准备首批遣返的病伤战俘已到达开城
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝中方面载运第一批将予遣返的朝鲜籍病伤战俘的车队，十六日下午到达开城。二十日我方就将开始遣送病伤战俘给美方。第一天遣返的有百分之五十为朝鲜籍战俘，百分之五十为非朝鲜籍战俘。
    今日到达的这些病伤战俘虽然经过了五百多公里的长途旅行，但因为一路上受到妥善的照顾、都不显得劳顿。
    在这些病伤战俘到达之前，高丽学校准备收容他们的临时医院已经全部准备停当，院内随处都可以看到穿着洁白外套的医务人员，诊疗室收拾得干干净净，并经过严格的消毒。每个病室里还都插着黄色的迎春花和淡紫色的金达莱花，如果没有周围被破坏的遗迹和墙壁上的弹痕，这里真是一所舒适的和平医院。
    但是美方对于将予遣返的我方病伤被俘人员的待遇与我方对战俘的人道待遇形成了尖锐的对比，美英通讯社昨天透露七百志愿军病伤被俘人员在自济州岛至釜山途中要求“联合国警卫给予较好的待遇”，而美国军队竟又采用了巨济岛和济州岛的老办法，用刺刀和毒气对我方被俘人员进行威胁和压迫。
