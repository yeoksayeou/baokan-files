    How We Organize Technical Personnel to Learn Russian
    Office of the First Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building
    Over the past three years, with the help of the Soviet Union, China's machine industry has rapidly recovered and developed. However, due to the shortage of translators, and the fact that most of the existing translators do not understand technology, we have encountered many difficulties in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In order to enable technical personnel to quickly acquire the ability to read Russian professional books, we selected a group of technical cadres to participate in the intensive Russian professional book study class in February of this year. After 22 days of intensive study, they achieved remarkable results, with 84% of the students achieving an average score of 80 or more in the exams. Now, the vast majority of students have initially mastered Russian grammar and learned 1,400 to 1,500 words. They have generally reached the point where they can largely read and translate the text in Soviet machine drawings, manuals, and professional books. This has created extremely favorable conditions for further learning of advanced Soviet science and technology.

            Composition of the Intensive Russian Study Class
    Based on the needs of our work, we selected seven engineers and 23 technicians to form the intensive Russian professional book reading class. We also selected six translators to serve as teachers. Subsequently, the leadership organization of the study class was established - the Russian Professional Book Reading Intensive Study Class Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Class Committee), which consisted of three people, one responsible for ideological leadership, one responsible for administrative affairs, and the other responsible for leading teaching. The Class Committee has two groups: administrative and teaching research. The administrative group is divided into five mutual aid groups, each with five to seven students, with one tutor (taught by the teachers). The teaching and research group consists of all teachers and three student representatives.
    The first feature of this organizational method is: clear division of labor. Ideological leadership, administrative affairs, and teaching work are all the responsibility of specific personnel. Another feature is: close integration of teaching and learning. The opinions of students on teaching work are often collected through mutual aid groups, and after research by the Class Committee and the Teaching and Research Group, it is used as the basis for improving teaching. This closely coordinates the lectures of the teachers and the requirements of the students.

    Formulation of the Teaching Plan
    Based on the principle that "intensive learning must be gradual" and the level of the students (most of them have specialized technical knowledge and understand one or more foreign languages), we determined that the duration of intensive learning was 22 days.
    The first phase of study lasted 11 days, during which the focus was on learning grammar. The textbooks used were the grammar lecture notes compiled by Tsinghua University. Students studied twice a day, morning and afternoon, with lectures lasting one hour or one and a half hours, and self-study for three hours (with special tutoring). A total of 600 new words were crammed in 11 days. Two exams were conducted in this phase (one after the verb lectures and a final exam at the end).
    The second phase of study lasted nine days. In this phase, on the one hand, we continued to learn grammar, and on the other hand, we learned short articles related to machinery (a total of seven articles). The progress of teaching was arranged according to the depth and length of the textbook content. The study time for each short article was eight hours: two hours of cramming new words, two hours of previewing, two hours of lecturing, and two hours of self-study tutoring. A total of seven days were spent studying seven short articles. The remaining two days were for reviewing, consolidating existing results, and preparing for the exam.
    The third phase (the internship phase) lasted two days. The two days were allocated as follows: the first day was for translating the text in machine design drawings. In the morning, the commonly used words in drawings and manuals were crammed, and in the afternoon, the text part in the drawings was read to familiarize with the usage on the drawings, and the method of looking up dictionaries was taught. The second day was for translating manuals. The selected materials were related to excavator manufacturing and assembly technology. Each article was very short and could be read as an independent short article, thus avoiding the shortcomings of incoherence in translation.

            Teaching Methods of the Intensive Study Class
    In order to enable the students to learn well in a short period of time, we paid attention to the following points in teaching:
    First, grasp the key points. That is, explain each key point in Russian grammar clearly and analyze words and sentences in detail. Second, establish a pre-lecture system: before the formal lecture, the main lecturer should conduct a pre-lecture in the teaching and research group to solicit the opinions of each teacher and student representative (such as whether there are any errors in the explanation, whether the content should be increased or decreased, etc.). Third, strengthen the guidance of students' self-study. Tutoring should be based on the content being taught and should not involve issues outside the textbook to avoid losing focus. In addition, according to the learning situation, students with poor performance were extracted from each mutual aid group for key tutoring.
    We carried out teaching in this way in three stages:
    First stage: When explaining Russian parts of speech, clarify the concept of each part of speech, focus on explaining the text part in the lecture notes, and give extensive examples. At the same time, explain the functions of attributes, predicates, participles, gerunds, etc., so that students clearly understand each part of speech.
    Second stage: At the beginning, we linked the new words learned in the first stage, first analyzed each word, and then analyzed the entire sentence. When the students reached a certain level of understanding of the text, we focused on the "analysis of words."
    In this stage, two hours of previewing time were stipulated every day, which proved to be very necessary. During the previewing time, the students were required to memorize all the words in the text (that is, to re-consolidate the words that had been crammed), analyze the changes of each word, the relationship between words, and analyze the sentences that could be analyzed. Through this preview, the students reviewed the grammar they had learned before, and memorized the things they did not understand, laying the foundation for the next internship.
    Third stage: This stage was mainly for translation exercises, and the selected textbooks were practical and simple in content. After the students translated, the teachers quickly corrected them, pointed out their mistakes and told them how to correct them, and the tutors tried to help solve the difficulties encountered by the students in the actual process.

            Several Experiences
    From this intensive teaching, we have gained the following experiences:
    First of all, we must focus on the ideological leadership of the students, and require them to take learning Russian as their own task. Before the start of the study, we must conduct full ideological mobilization among the students to keep them in a full learning mood at all times. Then mobilize everyone to formulate a learning agreement. During the study period, we must keep abreast of everyone's ideological situation and help them solve the difficulties encountered in learning in a timely manner; organize everyone to learn advanced learning methods (such as the "cyclic memory method" of Russian new words) and give full play to everyone's creativity.
    Secondly, we must constantly improve the teaching content and teaching methods. To achieve this goal, we must pay attention to the following two points:
    First, the teaching plan must be carefully considered when it is formulated. In teaching, teachers must strictly abide by the teaching plan and finish the prescribed courses within a certain period of time, so as not to affect the students' self-study.
    Second, the teaching and research group should often understand the students' learning situation and often study teaching methods and tutoring methods. The tutors must participate in the pre-lectures of the main lecturers, so that there will be no separation between teaching and tutoring.

    我们是怎样组织技术人员学习俄文的
    中央第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局办公室
    三年来，我国机器工业在苏联的帮助下，迅速恢复、发展。但是由于翻译人员不足，而且原有的翻译人员大多不懂得技术，致使我们在学习苏联先进经验方面遇到了不少的困难。为了使技术人员迅速地取得俄文专业书籍的阅读能力，我们曾在今年二月间抽调一批技术干部，参加俄文专业书籍速成学习班。他们经过二十二天的紧张学习，成绩显著，百分之八十四的学员考试成绩平均在八十分以上。现在，绝大部分学员都已初步掌握了俄文语法，学会了一千四百个到一千五百个单字。他们一般都达到了大体上能阅读和翻译苏联机器图样中的文字、说明书和专业书籍的程度。这为进一步学习苏联先进的科学技术创造了极其有利的条件。
            俄文速成学习班的组成
    我们根据工作的需要，抽调了工程师七人、技术人员二十三人，组织成俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习班。并抽调了六位翻译人员来担任教学工作。随后就成立了学习班的领导机构——俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习班委员会（以下简称班委会），它由三人组成，其中一人负责思想领导，一人负责行政事务，另一人负责领导教学。班委会下设行政和教学研究两个组。行政组下分五个互助组，每组有五个到七个学员，有一个辅导员（由教员担任）。教研组由全体教员和学员代表三人组成。
    这种组织方法的第一个特点是：分工明确。思想领导、行政事务、教学工作，都有专人负责。另一特点是：教和学密切结合。经常通过互助小组收集学员对教学工作方面的意见，经班委会和教研组研究后，把它作为改进教学的依据。这样就使教员的讲授和学员的要求密切地配合起来。教学计划的制订
    根据“速成学习必须循序渐进”的原则和学员的程度（他们大部分具有专门技术知识，并懂得一种以上的外国文），我们确定了速成学习的时间为二十二天。
    第一阶段的学习时间为十一天，在这期间集中力量学习语法。教材采用清华大学编的语法讲义。每天上下午分两次进行学习，讲课一小时或一小时半，自学三小时（有专人辅导）。十一天中共突击生词六百个。这一阶段共进行两次考试（动词讲完后进行了一次，最后进行了一次总考试）。
    第二阶段的学习时间共九天。在这个阶段中，一方面继续学习语法，另一方面学习有关机械方面的短文（共七篇）。教学的进程是根据教材内容的深浅、篇幅的长短来排定的。每篇短文的学习时间为八小时：两小时突击单字，两小时预习，两小时讲课，两小时自学辅导。七篇短文共计学习七天。最后剩下的两天是复习、巩固已有成绩和准备考试的时间。
    第三阶段（即实习阶段）的学习时间共二天。二天的时间是这样分配的：第一天翻译机器设计图样中的文字。上午突击图样和说明书中的常用单字，下午看图样中的文字部分，以熟悉图上的用语，并讲授查字典的方法。第二天翻译说明书。所选材料都是有关挖掘机制造和装配技术的。每篇文章都很短，可以把它当作独立的短文来读，这样就避免了翻译时前后不相衔接的缺点。
            速成学习班的教学方法
    为了在短促的时间内使学员学好，在教学中我们注意了以下几点：
    第一，抓住重点。就是说，讲清俄文语法中的每个要点，详细分析单字和句子。第二，建立预讲制度：在正式讲课以前，先由主讲教员在教研组中进行一次预讲，征求各个教员和学员代表的意见（如讲解有没有错误，内容是否要增减等）。第三，加强对学员自学的辅导。根据所讲授的内容进行辅导，不牵涉课本以外的问题，以免失去重点。另外，根据学习情况，将程度较差的学员从各互助组中抽出，进行重点辅导。
    我们在三个阶段中是这样进行教学的：
    第一阶段：在讲俄文词类时，把每个词类的概念讲清楚，并按照讲义中的文字部分进行重点讲解，广泛地举例说明。同时说明定语、谓语、形动词、副动词等的作用，使学员清楚地了解各个词类。
    第二阶段：开始时，我们联系第一阶段所学的生词，先对每个单词进行分析，然后对整个句子进行分析。当学员对课文的了解达到一定程度时，就有重点地进行“字的分析”。
    在这一阶段内，每天规定了两小时的预习时间，这证明是非常必要的。在预习时间内，要求学员记住课文内所有的单词（即将突击过的单词重新巩固一次），分析各字的变化，字和字之间的关系，并分析其所能分析的句子。通过这一预习，使学员复习了以前学过的文法，并记住了不懂的东西，为下一步的实习打下基础。
    第三阶段：这一阶段主要是进行翻译练习，所选教材是切合实际和内容浅显的。在学员翻译后，教员即迅速批改，指出其错误并告诉他们改正错误的方法，学员在实际过程中遇到的困难，辅导员就设法帮助解决。
            几点经验
    从这次速成教学中，我们得到了以下几点经验：
    首先，必须抓紧对学员的思想领导，要求他们将学好俄文作为自己的任务。学习开始前，要在学员中进行充分的思想动员，使他们始终保持饱满的学习情绪。然后发动大家订立学习公约。在学习期间，要随时了解大家的思想情况，及时地帮助他们解决在学习中所遇到的困难；组织大家学习先进的学习方法（如俄文生词“循环记忆法”），发挥每个人的创造性。
    其次，必须随时改进教学内容和教学方法。要达到这个目的，须注意以下两点：
    第一，订立教学计划时，必须经过周密的考虑。在教学中，教员要严格遵守教学计划，在一定的时间内讲完所规定的课程，以免影响学员的自习。
    第二，教研组应经常了解学员的学习情况，经常研究教学方法和辅导方法。主讲教员进行预讲时，辅导员一定要参加，这样才不致发生教学和辅导相脱节的现象。
