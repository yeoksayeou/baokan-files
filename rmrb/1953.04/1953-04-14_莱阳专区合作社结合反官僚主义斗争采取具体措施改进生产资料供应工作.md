Laiyang Special District Cooperatives in Shandong Province, in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, conducted self-criticism and criticism from top to bottom through inspection and work summaries, and finally determined specific methods for improving the supply of production materials.

The Laiyang Special District Cooperative convened six production materials supply meetings last year, but none of them formulated work plans based on the actual situation below, instead simply pressing tasks down. For example, when assigning sales targets for production materials at the second meeting, if anyone reported a lower number, leading cadres would say that he had "problems in the 'Three-Anti' campaign that he hadn't confessed, and that his thinking was problematic." The lower-level comrades reported once, and they thought it was too little, and wanted to increase it again; some reported four or five times, and were forced to increase it to the number of the plan assigned by the Special District Cooperative. The Special District Cooperative also emphasized that "whoever fails to complete the task will be dealt with for violating Party discipline and state law." This bureaucratic way of assigning work divorced the work from the actual situation below. For example, last year the higher authorities allocated 642 sprayers and 10,000 catties of sulfur powder to the Special District Cooperative. The cooperative didn't conduct investigations or research, but distributed them evenly to each county, while the cotton-producing areas only received 120 sprayers and 2,000 catties of sulfur powder. When insect pests occurred in the cotton areas, they hurriedly transferred them back from non-cotton producing areas, which affected timely pest control. The Special District Cooperative always emphasized in its instructions "the task is arduous, the season is pressing, and we must vigorously promote sales," but rarely gave specific methods or introduced experiences, thus fostering the bad habit of forced distribution below. For example, the instruction to loan waterwheels during last year's autumn harvest stated: "Rather push the waterwheels into the hands of the masses to store, than keep them in the cooperative." According to preliminary statistics, 44 percent of the waterwheels loaned last year were not used by farmers. The Fourth District Cooperative of Pingdong County allocated two waterwheels to Lanxi Village. The village cadres collected money according to the average acreage of land and divided the waterwheels into parts and distributed them to each household, causing great dissatisfaction among the farmers. Even more farmers did not use the forced-sale walking plows. These facts all show that the forced distribution below is directly related to the bureaucracy and commandism above.

After exposing and criticizing the above errors, the Laiyang Special District Cooperative further introduced the experiences of Pingdu and Zhaoyuan counties in promoting new-style farm tools and chemical fertilizers, greatly increasing the confidence of cooperative cadres in doing a good job. Based on the opinions of the lower-level cooperatives, the Special District Cooperative re-arranged the production materials supply work for this year:

First, deal with the waterwheels and walking plows supplied last year that have not yet been used. In areas where forced distribution occurred last year, the cooperative should earnestly conduct self-criticism to the farmers to obtain the understanding of the masses. All waterwheels and walking plows that were distributed to the districts and townships as units last year but not loaned to the farmers should be promoted to the farmers on the spot on a voluntary basis in conjunction with mobilizing spring plowing production, on the condition that they guarantee teaching the techniques and are responsible for repairing them if they are damaged. For farmers who have genuine difficulties in repaying the loan, the payment may be postponed or negotiated for a loan from the bank according to the actual situation, and no debt collection is allowed. On the basis of solving the above problems, steadily promote new-style walking plows and waterwheels according to the principle of farmers' voluntariness.

Second, when promoting new-style farm tools, strengthen technical guidance so that each promotion will play a role and each supply will have an effect. The method is to constantly summarize the experiences of farmers in using waterwheels, new-style walking plows, and chemical fertilizers to obtain bumper harvests, and use examples to compare and illustrate the effectiveness of new-style farm tools and chemical fertilizers. Within the cadres, establish role models for relying on the masses to do a good job, and mobilize everyone to learn and teach technology. The county cooperative shall be responsible for training cadres of grassroots cooperatives who manage production materials so that they know what they are doing when they manage something. To this end, the county cooperative shall organize possible forces, in conjunction with agricultural departments and handicraft production cooperatives, to pilot several farm tool assembly and repair stations to solve the difficulties for farmers in installing and repairing new-style farm tools and replacing parts.

Third, strengthen the leadership of production materials supply work at all levels, reduce unnecessary official documents and instructions, and the higher-level cooperatives should organize various forces to form work teams, go deep into the counties and grassroots cooperatives, and specifically inspect and help with the work.

    莱阳专区合作社结合反官僚主义斗争采取具体措施改进生产资料供应工作
    山东省莱阳专区合作社在反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪斗争中，通过检查和总结工作，自上而下地进行了检讨和批评，最后定出改进生产资料供应工作的具体办法。
    莱阳专区合作社去年曾经召开过六次生产资料供应会议，但没有一次是根据下面的实际情况，制订工作计划，而只是向下面压任务。如第二次会议布置推销生产资料数字时，谁报的少了，领导干部就说他“‘三反’中有问题没交代，思想有毛病”。下面同志报一次，他们嫌少，要再增加；有的报了四、五次，被迫增加到专区社布置的计划数字。专区社并强调“谁完不成任务，以违犯党纪国法论处”。这样官僚主义的布置工作，就脱离了下面的实际情况。如去年上级拨给专区合作社六百四十二部喷雾器和一万斤硫磺粉，该社不调查研究，就平均分配给各县，而产棉区只分配到一百二十部喷雾器和二千斤硫磺粉。等到棉区发生虫灾时，又急忙从非产棉区往回调拨，影响了及时治虫。专区社下达指示总是强调“任务重大，季节紧迫，要大力推销”，但很少具体交代办法和介绍经验，因而助长了下面强迫摊派的恶劣作风。如去年秋收下达贷水车的指示中就提出：“宁肯把水车推到群众手里存着，也不能压在合作社”。据初步材料统计，去年贷出的水车有百分之四十四农民没有使用。平东县四区合作社摊派给兰西村两部水车，村干部按地亩平均收了钱，把水车拆成零件按户分了，引起农民极大不满。强迫推销的步犁，农民没有使用的更多。这些事实都说明下面的强迫摊派和上面的官僚主义、命令主义直接有关。
    莱阳专区合作社在揭发与批判了上述错误以后，进一步介绍了平度、招远两县推广新式农具和化学肥料的经验，大大提高了合作社干部搞好工作的信心。专区社根据下级社的意见对今年生产资料供应工作重新作了具体布置：
    一、首先将去年供应下去但尚未使用的水车、步犁加以处理。在去年发生强迫摊派的地区，合作社要认真地向农民进行检讨，以取得群众的谅解。凡是去年以区、乡为单位进行摊派而没贷到农民手里的水车、步犁，在保证教会技术、坏了负责修理的条件下，结合动员春耕生产，在自愿原则下就地推销到农民手中。对还款确有困难的农民，可根据实际情况延期付款或商量由银行转贷，不得逼债。在解决上述问题的基础上，根据农民自愿的原则稳步推广新式步犁和水车。
    二、在推销新式农具的时候，加强技术指导，使今后推广一部就起一部的作用，供应一点就发挥一点的效果。作法是不断地总结农民使用水车、新式步犁、化学肥料获得丰收的经验，用实例对比说明新式农具、化学肥料的效能。在干部中要树立依靠群众做好工作的榜样，并动员大家学技术、教技术。县社要负责训练基层社经营生产资料的干部，做到经营什么懂得什么。为此，县社要组织可能的力量，结合农业部门和手工业生产合作社，试办几个农具装配修理站，以解决农民安装、修理新式农具及配换零件的困难。
    三、逐级加强对生产资料供应工作的领导，减少不必要的公文、指示，上级社并应组织各种力量，成立工作组，深入各县和基层合作社，具体检查和帮助工作。
