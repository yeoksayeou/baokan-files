    Central Water Conservancy Ministry Cadres Study Malenkov's Report, Diligently Examine Bureaucracy in Connection with Document Spirit
    The entire staff of the Central Water Conservancy Ministry, while studying Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, conducted a conscientious examination of bureaucracy in various aspects of their work, connecting it with the spirit of relevant documents.

    When the study began, discussions often became stagnant due to insufficient connection with reality. To reverse this situation, the leadership mobilized all cadres to examine their work in connection with reality and promoted the experiences of groups that were better at connecting with reality. Responsible cadres from various departments, bureaus, and sections, connected the study with their main duties and, combined with the study of Comrade Bo Yibo's report at the Central Financial and Economic Commission's meeting of ministerial-level cadres, conducted discussions. In this way, many shortcomings were revealed in key tasks, achieving the goal of improving work through study.

    In examining the handling of letters and visits from the masses, serious bureaucratic practices were discovered. Some people rudely demanded that suggestions from the masses be "completely correct," and instead of welcoming the enthusiastic letters from the masses, they expressed annoyance, even giving arbitrary refutations and criticisms in their replies. However, facts have proven that many suggestions from the masses are valuable. For example, letters from the masses suggested that building a reservoir in Wuzhi, Henan, could reduce the Yellow River floods. At that time, the ministry's technical personnel only focused on finding reservoir sites in mountainous areas, mistakenly believing that the Wuzhi area was a plain and unsuitable for building reservoirs, so they refuted the opinions of the masses. However, after investigation, research, and summarizing three years of work experience, it has been proven that the opinions of the masses were correct. Not only can reservoirs be built in mountainous areas, but they can also be built in plains. In fact, the ministry is considering building reservoirs in the Wuzhi area.

    Criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, has not been fully developed in many units. First of all, the leadership does not pay enough attention to criticism from the masses. For example, the masses have criticized the slow work style of the leadership in several movements, but it has not been improved for a long time, which has damaged the enthusiasm of the masses to offer opinions. Some comrades have also examined their incorrect views on criticism, such as being afraid to offer opinions to leading comrades, preferring to be a "pleasant and agreeable" person; some section-level leading cadres can only accept the opinions of leading comrades and cannot accept opinions from below. As a result, comrades are either on overly friendly terms or are disunited.

    Many cadres also examined their lax discipline and perfunctory work attitude. For example, some comrades were afraid to take responsibility, and when approving engineering plans from below, they wrote ambiguous opinions such as "should be approved" or "seems feasible." For example, the former Planning Department did not carefully review the Han Chuan Sluice plan submitted by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and replied by telegram: "You can do it if you think it is economically beneficial." Sixteen culverts were to be built in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, but only one drawing was submitted for approval. As a result, fifteen of them were damaged after completion. The Hydrology Bureau approved plans most loosely, and lower-level agencies reflected that the Hydrology Bureau was "the easiest to talk to." The former Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau approved most of the submitted plans, but many of the approved irrigation plans were not completed. In reviewing budgets, some only proofread the technical design and not the engineering unit price, believing that it was acceptable as long as it did not exceed the control figure. In addition, the phenomena of being fond of boasting and having an unrealistic work style were also very serious. For example, the Hydrology Bureau once planned to establish 20,000 rain gauge stations across the country in 1952, which is almost nine times more than the number of counties in the country. This is completely impossible in the current situation, and it is also unnecessary in practice. The former Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau felt that the plan to dig one million wells in Shandong was too large when reviewing it, but it did not raise any objections. As a result, half of the wells dug were unusable.

    The bureaucratic practice of layer-by-layer signing of documents is also very serious in some units. For example, the former Surveying and Mapping Department sent two documents to one unit on the same day for the same matter, and they were mutually contradictory. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission submitted a drilling work plan, which was transferred back and forth for more than a month without approval, and was eventually mistakenly filed; while the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission was anxiously waiting for the plan to be approved so that it could start work. These situations are not isolated.

    The selection of talents and the examination of implementation in the past have also not been satisfactory. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report, the leadership has a very poor understanding of the staffing of directly subordinate agencies, and some only sign and approve based on official resumes, inevitably causing some cadres to be incompetent and unable to complete their tasks well; and they were not adjusted in time after they were discovered. Some cadres in the ministry are irresponsible in their work and do not care about political study, and the personnel department does not fully understand these situations.

    The phenomenon of only assigning work tasks and lacking inspection is also very serious. For example, the former Surveying and Mapping Department formulated more than a dozen systems, but none of them were ever inspected. The measurement inspection system that was formulated was basically not implemented below, and the reasons for this were not studied; some outdated or ineffective systems were not abolished or revised in time. For example, the 1950 regulation stipulated that topographic surveys in mountainous areas should be carried out at a rate of 0.5 to 1.5 square kilometers per day, which has long been overturned by facts, but Sichuan Province still considers it a standard. In fact, the average rate of topographic surveys in mountainous areas in some places has now increased to 3 square kilometers per day, with a maximum of 4 or 5 square kilometers.

    Due to insufficient ideological and political education for cadres, many ideological problems cannot be resolved in a timely manner. For example, in the study of advanced Soviet experience, many technical personnel still have serious pro-American views and remnants of bourgeois ideology, and they are skeptical about advanced Soviet science and technology. For example, when the Soviet's pileless foundation was promoted in Runheji, many technical personnel had many different opinions.

    After this study and in-depth examination of work, many comrades made self-criticisms and put forward some suggestions for improving work, which has changed the face of work. For example, various units have been much more thorough and careful in reviewing the 1953 budget than in the past, and many budgets have been reduced. The former Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau realized the significance of a plan once approved becoming law, and thus established a responsible attitude, stipulating the ratio of irrigated area to funding, and reducing funding that was too large. Criticism and self-criticism among comrades has also become more normal than in the past. Relations that were not good have also begun to improve. Comrades who did not have enough trust in Soviet experts began to realize their erroneous thinking and expressed their determination to learn from advanced Soviet experience.

    Through the inspection of the senior cadres' study group, the leadership accepted the opinions of the masses and strengthened ideological leadership over cadres. The theoretical study of senior cadres has been maintained and consolidated; a study committee office has been established to strengthen the leadership of the theoretical study of general cadres. Responsible cadres of various departments, bureaus, and sections have also focused on the study of cadres in their units, and the political atmosphere in the organs has become stronger than before. Everyone has realized the importance of political theory study and has become interested in theoretical study. The planning of the work of the organs has also gradually strengthened, and various units have paid attention to establishing work plans and checking the implementation.

    中央水利部干部在学习马林科夫报告中
    联系文件精神认真检查官僚主义
    中央水利部全体在职干部在学习马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中，联系文件精神，对各项工作中的官僚主义进行了一次认真的检查。
    当学习开始时，由于联系实际不够，讨论会上常常冷场。领导方面为了扭转这一情况，发动全体干部联系实际检查工作，并推广联系实际较好的小组的经验。各厅、司、局、处负责干部都联系主要业务，并结合学习薄一波同志在中央财政经济委员会部长级干部会议上的报告，进行讨论。这样，就在主要工作中揭发出了不少缺点，使学习达到了改进工作的目的。
    在检查处理群众来信、来访工作中发现有严重的官僚主义作风。有的人粗暴地要求群众所提建议必须“完全正确”，对群众各种热情洋溢的来信不是表示欢迎，而是表示厌烦，甚至在回信中给以随意的批驳和打击。但事实证明，许多群众的建议是有价值的。如群众来信中曾建议在河南武陟修水库可以减除黄河洪灾。但那时该部的技术人员只注意在山谷地区寻找水库库地，错误地认为武陟一带是平原，不能兴修水库，所以便对群众的意见加以批驳。但经过调查研究和总结三年来工作经验证明：群众的意见是对的，不仅山谷地区，可以修建水库；而且在平原地区也可以兴修水库，事实上该部也正考虑在武陟一带地区修建水库。
    批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评在许多单位还远没有充分展开。首先是领导方面对群众的批评重视不够。如对领导方面工作作风拖拉问题，群众在几次运动中都提出了批评，但长期没有得到改进，这样就伤害了群众提意见的积极性。有的同志也检查了对批评的不正确观点，如不敢对领导同志提意见，宁可做一个“随和可喜”的人；有的科级领导干部只能接受领导同志的意见，不能接受来自下面的意见。因而同志之间不是一团和气就是闹不团结。
    不少干部还检查了纪律松弛、敷衍了事的工作态度。如有的同志怕负责任，在批覆下面的工程计划时，竟批些“似应批准”“尚属可行”等模棱两可的意见。如前规划司对长江水利委员会所报送之汉川闸的计划，未详细审查即电覆道：“你们认为合于经济效益就可以做”。长江下游要做十六个涵洞，只送来一张图就批准了，结果做成以后坏了十五个。水文局批覆计划最松，下级机关反映水文局
    “最好说话”。前农田水利局对报送的计划绝大部分都批准了，但批准的灌溉计划很多完不成。在审核预算中有的只校对技术设计，不校算工程单价，竟认为不超过控制数字就可以。此外，好大喜功，作风不踏实的现象也很严重。如水文局曾计划一九五二年在全国设立两万个雨量站，这个数目比全国所有县治几乎多了九倍，在目前情况下是完全做不到的，而且实际上也是不必要的。前农田水利局对山东打井一百万眼的计划，审核时已感到计划过大，但也未提出意见，结果打出的井有一半不能用。
    层层签署的文牍主义作风在某些单位也很严重。如前测验司在同一天对一件事情就发给一个单位两纸公文，且前后自相矛盾。长江水利委员会报来一份钻探工作计划，一个多月转来转去未批，最后被错误地存入档案；而长江水利委员会却急待批准计划后好动手工作。这些情况并不是个别的。
    关于正确挑选人材和检查执行的情形，过去也做得不能令人满意。正如马林科夫同志报告中所指出的一样，领导上由于对直属机关干部的配置状况了解很差，有的只凭公文履历表签署批准，因而不可避免地使有些干部不称职，不能很好地完成任务；发现后又未及时加以调整。部内有些干部工作不负责任，政治学习不关心，人事处对这些情况也不十分了解。
    工作任务只有布置、缺乏检查的现象也很严重。如前测验司曾制定过十几种制度，但都未检查过。所订测量检查制度下面基本上没有执行，也未研究其原因；有些过时或不起作用的制度，也没有及时废除或修改。如一九五○年规定山区地形测量每日进行零点五至一点五平方公里，已经早被事实所推翻，但至今仍被四川省认为是个标准。实际上现在有些地方的山区地形测量已提高到每日平均进行三平方公里，最高达到四或五平方公里。
    由于平时对干部的思想政治教育不够，因此许多思想问题不能及时解决。如对苏联先进经验的学习，有许多技术人员仍存有严重的崇美观点和资产阶级思想的残余，对苏联的先进科学技术抱怀疑态度。如苏联的无桩基础在润河集推行时，许多技术人员就意见纷纷。
    通过这次学习和深入检查工作之后，许多同志作了检讨，并提出了一些改进工作的意见，使工作的面貌为之一变。如各单位在审核一九五三年预算时，就比过去周密仔细得多，许多预算核减了。前农田水利局体会到计划一经批准即形成法律的意义，因而树立了认真负责的态度，规定了灌溉面积与经费的比例，使经费太大的都予以核减。同志间的批评与自我批评也比过去正常了。关系不好的也开始改善。对苏联专家信任不足的同志开始认识了自己的错误思想，表示决心学习苏联先进经验。
    领导上经过高级干部学习小组的检查，接受了群众的意见，加强了对干部的思想领导。高级干部的理论学习已坚持并巩固下来；成立了学委办公室，加强对一般干部理论学习的领导。各司、局、处负责干部对本单位干部学习也抓紧了，机关中政治空气较前浓厚，大家都认识了政治理论学习的重要性，对理论学习发生了兴趣。机关工作的计划性也逐渐加强，各单位已注意订立工作计划和检查执行情况。
