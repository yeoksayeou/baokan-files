Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: American bourgeois commentators have recently had to admit that, because the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union persists in a peaceful policy of resolving international disputes through negotiation, which conforms to the unanimous wishes of peace-loving people all over the world, the US government has fallen into a very difficult diplomatic situation.

The official United States Information Service, in a telegram from Washington on the 27th, summarized a commentary by Joseph Harsch published in the "Christian Science Monitor," which emphasized that the Soviet Union's recent repeated reaffirmation of its sincerity in peacefully resolving international problems has put the Eisenhower government in a "dilemma." Harsch pointed out that the United States' problem is that if it makes a public response to expressions of peace, it will bankrupt the current US policy based on war, which will "undermine the entire European unification movement and make it impossible for the United States to reduce armaments," which the US capitalists are extremely unwilling to do. But on the other hand, if it "makes no response," the United States will find it difficult to evade the responsibility of deliberately creating war.

The same anxiety is expressed even more clearly in a commentary by "Washington Star" columnist Dorothy Thompson. In an article published on March 14, Thompson believed that the Soviet Union's peace proposals would inevitably be supported. In this situation, if the United States refuses peace proposals, then the United States cannot escape the "responsibility for the continuation of tension and danger." He concluded that if the United States "continues to adopt a rigid policy, it will increase the current hostility and fear (of various countries) towards the United States, and will divide public opinion within France and Germany even more severely." He said that if the United States rashly rejects peace proposals, there is a greater possibility of conflict occurring among Western countries.

### 美评论家承认  美政府在外交上处境困难

    美评论家承认
    美政府在外交上处境困难
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国资产阶级评论家最近不得不承认：由于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营坚持通过谈判来解决国际争端的和平政策符合全世界爱好和平人民的一致愿望，美国政府在外交上已陷入十分困难的境地。
    官方的美国新闻处在二十七日从华盛顿发出的一条电讯里摘要报道了“基督教科学箴言报”刊载的约瑟夫·哈希的评论，其中着重指出，苏联最近一再重申和平解决国际问题的诚意已使艾森豪威尔政府处于“进退两难的境地”。哈希指出，美国的难题在于：如果对于和平的表示作公开的回答，就会使目前以战争为基础的美国政策破产，这会“破坏整个欧洲统一运动，并且会使美国不能不裁减军备”，而这是美国的资本家所极不愿意的。但另一方面，如果“不作任何回答”，美国就会难以推卸蓄意制造战争的责任。
    同样的焦虑在“华盛顿明星报”专栏作家桃乐赛·汤普生的评论中表现得更明显。汤普生在三月十四日发表的文章中认为苏联的和平表示必定受到拥护。在这种情况下，如果美国拒绝和平的表示，那么，美国就逃避不了使“紧张局势和危险之继续存在的责任”。他断定，美国如果“继续采取死板不变的政策，将会增加目前（各国）对美国的敌意和惧怕，并且将使法国和德国内部的舆论分歧得甚至更为厉害。”他说，如果美国贸然拒绝和平的建议，在西方国家之间便有更大的可能会发生冲突。
