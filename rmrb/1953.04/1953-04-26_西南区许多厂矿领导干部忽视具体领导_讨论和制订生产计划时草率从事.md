Many Factory and Mine Leading Cadres in the Southwest Region Neglect Specific Leadership; Hasty Discussions and Formulations of Production Plans

The state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region generally formulated and discussed their production plans for the second quarter and April from the end of March to the beginning of April. According to statistics from forty-five major factories and mines, as of April 10th, thirty-five factories and mines had discussed their second-quarter plans, and forty-four factories and mines had discussed their April plans. However, in many factories and mines, leading cadres did not pay enough attention to the issue of planning, so the discussions of the plans were relatively hasty. Some simply submitted the plans to the masses for approval, lacking both an in-depth examination of the chaotic phenomena that existed in past plan management and specific and effective measures to ensure the completion of state plans in the future.

The discussions of plans at State-owned Steel Plants 102 and 101, and Cotton Mill 610 were relatively good. In these factories, leading cadres personally participated in the discussion and formulation of plans, and the workers discussed the plans three to five times. Some places have already effectively corrected the conservative thinking of some leading cadres. The original April plan for a workshop in Plant 102 was to produce 780 tons, but after discussions by workers and technicians based on existing production efficiency, it was discovered that more than 910 tons could be produced in the entire month. The original quota for rolling a certain type of steel bar in this workshop was 559 bars per 8-hour shift, but after discussion by the workers, it was changed to 700 bars. However, in just a few days, the first shift created a new record of 800 bars. After the employees of Plant 101 discussed the plan, the plans for each field were improved compared to the original. In steel rail production, workers discussed and came up with a method to increase the output per unit hour by 23 percent, and the effective working hours per shift increased from 5 hours and 44 minutes to 6 hours and 30 minutes. During the few days of discussion, the employees of Plant 101 submitted more than 500 rationalization proposals. Because the workshop cadres first analyzed the production situation in their workshops and pointed out the key issues and weak links to the workers, many suggestions and specific methods revolved around the major issues of the workshops. For example, the workers in Field 2 proposed to install cranes themselves, the workers in Field 3, Du Zhiqing, proposed an operating method for heat-treating the steel furnace bottom, and the workers in Field 6 proposed to shorten the time for changing track spike molds and improve the quality of track spikes. These were all problems that had not been resolved for a long time, but they were resolved after this plan discussion. The first-quarter products of Cotton Mill 610 were of poor quality, making it difficult for the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company to sell them, resulting in a loss of more than 600 million yuan for the factory. The factory leadership conducted an in-depth examination of this issue, educated all employees, and then convened technical personnel and veteran workers to study and discuss it. A preliminary plan of technical measures to improve quality was drafted, and then the workers were mobilized to discuss it. During the discussion, trade union cadres went deep into the workshops and first helped a group or a worker to draw up a plan as an example, and then used this to promote workers in various groups in the workshop to analyze each other's operational shortcomings, find ways to improve, and specifically draw up specific measures plans for each person and each group. Because the discussion of the plan was more in-depth in this factory, and the methods for each person and each group to ensure the completion of the state plan were more specific, the production in April has improved significantly.

However, in the above-mentioned factories with relatively good plan discussions, there are still several major shortcomings in the discussion of the plan: (1) The discussion of the plan is not universal in various units within the factory. The production workshop has discussed it, but the management departments such as various sections and offices, as well as auxiliary departments such as material supply, maintenance, and transportation, rarely discuss it. According to the situation of factories and mines in the Southwest region, although these departments cannot formulate comprehensive plans at present, they should still formulate partial and feasible plans around the product plan. In particular, material supply, maintenance, transportation and other departments should at least examine the shortcomings and various chaotic phenomena that existed in past work, and formulate effective improvement measures. Otherwise, it is often difficult to ensure that the workshop can carry out production in a planned manner. (2) The discussion of the plan failed to combine with the anti-bureaucracy struggle in factories and mines. When many factories discussed the plan, the employees were very dissatisfied because the leaders had delayed solving many problems for a long time, and they demanded exposure and correction. For example, a workshop in Plant 102 often affected work due to untimely spare parts in the past. However, many factories did not promptly guide the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up to overcome the shortcomings of the leadership, but believed that the workers' opinions were emphasizing objective difficulties. (3) When mobilizing employees to discuss the plan, there was a lack of political education and propaganda mobilization work, and the great significance of improving production to fight against U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the country's first five-year plan was not well publicized. Therefore, the enthusiasm of employees could not be improved ideologically and politically.

The reason why the discussion of plans in many state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region is so hasty and not in-depth is mainly because the enterprise leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of this discussion of the national plan. The situation of completing the national plan in the first quarter in many factories and mines in the Southwest region is not good. This is mainly because the factory and mine leading cadres lack the concept of resolutely completing the national plan; in the production reform, they isolatedly grasped the key points, solved certain technical key problems, and ignored the comprehensive plan management. The Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee began to correct the above shortcomings in March, emphasizing to the leading cadres of various factories and mines that it is necessary to attach importance to the completion of the national plan, attach importance to plan management, and continue to carry out production reform in depth on the track of strengthening plan management. Judging from the current situation, the spirit of this instruction has not yet been implemented in many factories and mines in the Southwest region. First of all, some leading cadres of the Industrial Bureau under the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee still do not pay enough attention to the issue of planning. For example, the second quarter and April plans of various factories and mines have been mostly discussed this time, but many leading cadres of the Industrial Bureau have not gone deep into the factories and mines to conduct specific leadership and assistance, and they know very little about the discussion situation and existing problems in the factories and mines.

    西南区许多厂矿领导干部忽视具体领导
    讨论和制订生产计划时草率从事
    西南区国营及地方国营厂矿，在三月底到四月初普遍制订和讨论了第二季度及四月份的生产计划。根据四十五个主要厂矿统计，到四月十日为止，有三十五个厂矿已讨论了第二季度的计划，四十四个厂矿讨论了四月份的计划。但有许多厂矿，由于领导干部对计划问题不够重视，因此计划就讨论比较草率，有的只是把计划交群众通过了事，对过去计划管理上存在的混乱现象既缺乏深入的检查，今后如何保证国家计划的完成也缺乏具体有效的措施。
    讨论计划比较好的是国营一零二及一零一钢铁厂、六一零纱厂等。在这些厂里，领导干部亲自参加讨论制订计划，工人对计划都进行了三次到五次的讨论。有些地方已经有力地纠正了某些领导干部的保守思想。一零二厂某车间四月份原计划生产七百八十吨，但经过工人、技术人员根据现有生产效力，进行讨论的结果，发现全月可以生产九百一十多吨。该车间轧制某种钢条，原来每班八小时的定额是五百五十九条，经工人讨论后改为七百条，但过不几天，第一班就创造了八百条的新纪录。一零一厂的计划经职工讨论后，各场的计划都较原来提高了。一场钢轨生产，经工人讨论出办法，单位小时产量可增加百分之二十三，每班有效工时由五时四十四分增加到六点三十分。在几天的讨论中，一零一厂全厂职工提出了五百多条合理化建议。由于车间干部首先分析了本车间的生产情况，向工人指出了关键问题及薄弱环节，所以，不少建议和具体办法都是围绕着车间的重大问题提出来的。如二场工人提出自己安装吊车，三场工人杜志清提出热修炼钢炉底的操作方法，六场工人提出缩短换道钉模的时间，并提高道钉质量，这些都是长期未能解决的问题，经过这次讨论计划都解决了。六一零纱厂第一季度产品因质量低劣，使花纱布公司很难推销，给工厂造成六亿多元的损失。该厂领导上对这个问题深入进行检查，教育全体职工，然后召集技术人员、老工人研究讨论，初步拟定出提高质量的技术措施计划，再发动工人讨论。讨论时，工会干部深入车间，先帮助一个小组、一个工人订出计划作例子，然后以此推动车间各个小组的工人互相分析操作上的缺点，找出改进办法，具体订出每人及每组的具体措施计划。该厂因讨论计划比较深入，每人、每组保证完成国家计划的办法比较具体，四月份的生产已有显著改进。
    但是，在上述几个讨论计划比较好的工厂里，对计划的讨论还有几个重大缺点：（一）厂内各单位讨论计划不普遍。生产车间讨论了，厂内各科、室等管理部门及材料供应、检修、运输等辅助部门却很少讨论。根据西南厂矿的情况，这些部门目前虽然尚不能制订全面的计划，但仍应围绕着产品计划，订出部分的切实可行的计划，特别是材料供应、检修、运输等部门，最低限度也应该检查过去工作中存在的缺点及各种混乱现象，订出有效的改进办法。不然，就往往难以保证车间有计划地进行生产。（二）讨论计划未能结合厂矿的反官僚主义斗争。很多厂在讨论计划时，职工因过去领导上对很多问题长期拖延不予解决，十分不满，要求揭发和纠正。如一零二厂某车间过去常因备品不及时，影响工作。但很多厂并没有及时引导群众开展自下而上的批评和自我批评，以克服领导方面的缺点，却认为工人提意见是强调客观困难。（三）在发动职工讨论计划时，缺乏进行政治教育和宣传鼓动工作，没有很好宣传提高生产对抗美援朝斗争，和国家第一个五年计划的伟大意义，因此，就不能从思想上、政治上来提高职工的积极性。
    西南区许多国营厂矿对计划讨论的所以草率、不深入，主要是因为企业领导干部对此次讨论国家计划的重要性认识不足。西南区许多厂矿第一季完成国家计划的情况是不好的。这主要是厂矿领导干部缺乏坚决完成国家计划的观念；在生产改革中孤立地抓关键，解决某些技术上的关键问题，而忽视全面的计划管理。中共中央西南局及西南财政经济委员会在三月份开始纠正上述缺点，向各厂矿领导干部强调指出：要重视国家计划的完成，重视计划管理，在加强计划管理的轨道上继续深入进行生产改革。就目前情况看，西南区许多厂矿对这一指示的精神尚未贯彻执行。首先是西南财政经济委员会所属工业局的某些领导干部对计划问题仍不够重视。如此次各厂矿第二季度及四月份计划大部已讨论完毕，而不少工业局的领导干部却没有深入厂矿进行具体的领导和帮助，对厂矿中讨论的情况和存在的问题却很少了解。                    （林沫）
