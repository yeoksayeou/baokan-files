    Basic Summary and Future Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement Over the Past Four Years
    —Excerpts from a Report at the Second National Women's Congress of China
    Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

    Since the First National Women's Congress of China convened in March 1949, the organizations at all levels of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, have implemented the resolutions of the First National Women's Congress of China, mobilized and organized women of all ethnic groups to, together with the people of the whole country, first carry the revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to the end, actively supported the Chinese People's Liberation War, liberated the mainland of the whole country, and established the independent and unified People's Republic of China. Subsequently, they actively participated in the great movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, various social reform works, and various construction undertakings of the country. In these movements and this work, the organizations at all levels of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation paid special attention to implementing the policy of focusing on mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production.

    Over the past four years, China's women's movement has achieved great results, the awareness of the broad masses of women has been generally raised, solidarity has been strengthened, and organizations have been expanded. Democratic Women's Federations have been established in all provinces and cities across the country, as well as in the vast majority of counties. Women's organizations are being established in various fraternal ethnic minority areas. The Democratic Women's Federations of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Province have already cultivated a group of women cadres from various ethnic groups; Tibet also established the Preparatory Committee of the Tibetan Patriotic Women's Association in March of this year.

    With the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the development of the motherland's construction, the common efforts of the broad masses of women and women cadres have enabled women to achieve equal status and rights with men.

    Over the past four years, Chinese women's enthusiasm for participating in agricultural production has greatly increased, the number of participants has increased year by year, and a considerable number of rural working women have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, enabling women to participate in production as laborers, with men and women dividing the work and cooperating. This has enabled women to undertake labor that is more suitable for their physical strength, and to learn from male farmers, continuously improving their skills and increasing the role of women in production. This has gradually helped women solve the contradiction between participating in production and raising children, protect women's health, and gradually improve the status of women.

    Over the past four years, due to the recovery and development of China's national economy, a broad path has been opened up for women to participate in economic construction, and the number of female workers participating in industrial construction has increased year by year. With great enthusiasm, they participated in the patriotic production competition, learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and demonstrated a high degree of creativity, proving that female workers are an important force in the industrial construction of New China. In the textile industry, the number of female workers accounts for more than 60% of the total number of workers. The creation and promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method is an important event in the textile industry; last year, more than 20,000 outstanding Hao Jianxiu workers emerged, increasing the quantity and quality of textiles, reducing costs, and saving a large amount of wealth for the country. Many women have also participated in production departments that had never been participated in by women before. Through their hard work and dedicated efforts, many new people and new things have emerged. The number of female workers mastering heavy industrial technologies is increasing year by year.

    The people's democratic power of New China guarantees that women have equal political rights with men and creates various conditions for women to realize these rights. In government institutions at all levels, women have been elected as people's representatives and government workers. In the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a large number of female cadres and female soldiers are working hard and actively at the front and in the rear, making significant contributions. An even larger number of families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers are encouraging their loved ones to join the army, while they themselves are working hard in the rear, raising the young and supporting the old, enabling their loved ones in the army to be more courageous in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending the motherland.

    Chinese women have obtained the same educational opportunities as men. In particular, since the implementation of land reform and the democratic reform movement in factories and mines, the lives of workers and peasants have improved, and a large number of children of workers and peasants have entered schools, truly enabling women to have the same opportunity to enter school as men. At present, the number of female students in various schools is increasing, and a large number of women are engaged in glorious education work. Women have become an important force in medical and health undertakings and the patriotic health movement.

    After the founding of New China, feudal ideas and traditional customs that value men over women have lost their political and economic foundations for existence. In this year's movement to implement the Marriage Law, cadres of Party and government organs and women's organizations, especially cadres in charge of marriage affairs, as well as cadres in districts, townships, and villages, have generally studied the "Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China." They have made progress in their thinking and have begun to attach importance to the implementation of the Marriage Law, creating favorable conditions for the long-term implementation of the Marriage Law. From the work of implementing the Marriage Law carried out in rural areas, streets, and factories across the country, as well as the widespread publicity work carried out among the masses, it can be seen that in areas where the work has been done well, the awareness of the masses has been greatly raised, enabling them to recognize the harm of the feudal marriage system of forced arranged marriages and male supremacy, and the benefits of the new democratic marriage system of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women. Many families that were originally disharmonious between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have also improved their relations after mediation. However, it must be recognized that completely changing the traditional ideas and customs of valuing men over women can only be achieved through long-term, meticulous, and in-depth work.

    In our country, mothers and children have received the care and necessary protection of the state. The Labor Insurance Regulations stipulate that female workers have 56 days of maternity leave before and after childbirth, and their wages are paid as usual. Female workers and male workers' families can receive maternity subsidies when giving birth. Nearly 30,000 maternity stations, maternal and child health stations, and obstetrical hospitals have been established nationwide; more than 269,000 midwives have been trained and reformed, and new methods of childcare and universal vaccination against smallpox have been promoted. The childcare cause has made great progress in the past four years, and childcare organizations have developed greatly in factories, mines, enterprises, and in rural areas.

    Over the past four years, Chinese women have actively participated in the progressive activities of international women. In the great movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Chinese women actively supported the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army; and actively responded to all the calls of the World Peace Council and the Women's International Democratic Federation, enthusiastically participating in the signature campaign for the peace declaration and the demand for the five major powers to sign a peace treaty, and other activities to defend world peace and protect the rights of women and children. Chinese women have established contacts with women in 53 countries. Chinese women have become an important force in the world women's peace and democratic movement.

    The above-mentioned facts illustrate that China's women's movement has made great achievements in the past four years, proving that the broad masses of women can make great contributions to the cause of defending peace and building the motherland. As long as they are mobilized and organized in various practical works, through necessary steps that are adapted to their specific conditions and using various forms, they can gradually overcome difficulties like men, complete the various tasks assigned to them by the motherland, and improve their own status.

    Summarizing the Chinese women's movement over the past four years, there are the following four main experiences:

    First, the reason why the Chinese women's movement has been able to achieve the above-mentioned achievements is because it has combined the cause of women's liberation with the entire cause of the country and the people. We have mobilized and organized the masses of women to unite with men, work together, and strive to complete the central tasks put forward by the CCP Central Committee and the Central People's Government to the people of the whole country in various periods. Through various central tasks, we have raised women's awareness, trained women's abilities, united women's strength, and used this to practically educate those who discriminate against women and do not value women.

    Second, we have implemented the policy of focusing on mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production as the center of women's work, gradually making the broad masses of women builders of New China. Experience has proved that mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production is the basic key to promoting equal status between men and women and completely liberating women. We should repeatedly emphasize that this is the long-term and fundamental task of the women's liberation movement. Of course, in order to fully mobilize and organize women to participate in production, not only should they be mobilized to directly participate in industry, agriculture, and other various production undertakings, but they should also be mobilized to participate in cultural education, medical and health care, and childcare undertakings to serve the development of production.

    Third, when men and women are jointly mobilized to implement and complete the central tasks of the people of the whole country, and when a large number of women are organized to participate in industrial and agricultural production, special attention must be paid to helping and educating the masses of women to improve their awareness and ability; and starting from the actual situation of women's lives, take care of women's special difficulties, such as the difficulty of raising children and the burden of housework, as well as the difficulties arising from women's physiological particularities, and actively and appropriately help them overcome these difficulties according to the needs and possibilities of the time and place. And for the feudal remnant ideas and traditional customs that hinder women's participation in central work and production undertakings, they must be criticized by reasoning, so that women's problems can be gradually resolved.

    Fourth, because women's work is a complex work related to various aspects, this requires democratic women's federations at all levels to have appropriate working methods when carrying out their work. The first is to send capable cadres to participate in the working institutions established to complete the central tasks, so as to reflect the situation of the masses of women at any time, put forward opinions and experiences in carrying out work among women, and assist leading organs at all levels in unifying the deployment and implementation of women's work tasks. Democratic women's federations should also actively unite relevant organs and groups, divide labor and cooperate, and jointly solve a certain women's problem and complete the women's work tasks of a certain period.

    Thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the care and support of the Central and local People's Governments, the close unity of women of all ethnic groups and democratic classes, and the common efforts of the broad masses of women and cadres, rich experience has been created, enabling Chinese women's work to gradually move forward.

    Our great motherland has entered a new historical period, and national construction has begun. Vigorously mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of women, giving full play to potential forces, and participating in industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of the motherland's construction are the central tasks of the women's movement in the future.

    In order to realize this task, first, in cities, democratic women's federations must supervise and help trade unions do a good job in women's work, mobilize and organize female workers to actively participate in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to improve labor productivity, learn and master advanced technology, save raw materials, and improve product quality.

    In order to give full play to the labor production enthusiasm of female workers, under the current production conditions, democratic women's federations should supervise and help trade unions to strive for appropriate solutions to the safe production, labor protection, and other special problems of female workers that can be solved. Disregarding women's work, ignoring the special requirements and special circumstances of female workers, and failing to strive for solutions to problems that can be solved are detrimental to production and should be corrected.

    Educating and organizing intellectual women, all female scientists, technicians, cultural and educational workers, and medical and health workers, should actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, go deep into rural areas, factories and mines, deep into the masses, deep into reality, improve themselves, do a good job, and serve production.

    The work of staff and workers' families and housewives is an important aspect of urban women's work. Democratic women's federations should educate mothers to take good care of their children and teach their children well, so that they become children who are healthy in body and mind. This is the glorious duty of mothers. Democratic women's federations should educate the broad masses of housewives and staff and workers' families to do a good job in housework, strengthen their studies, improve their political and cultural level, and prepare themselves so that they can participate in the various construction works of the motherland at any time when the motherland needs them. In particular, staff and workers' families should regard protecting staff and workers and encouraging staff and workers to do a good job in production as their glorious task. For those active members of staff and workers' families and housewives who have already participated in social activities, attention should be paid to taking care of the necessary time for family labor.

    Second, in rural areas, women's work must be carried out around agricultural production and serve agricultural production, vigorously mobilize rural working women to actively participate in the patriotic production increase movement and participate in agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations on a voluntary basis; learn and improve agricultural technology, and make greater achievements in fertilizer accumulation, seed selection, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, so as to increase the yield per unit area and increase the production of grain and other crops. Rural sideline production and handicraft production, in the vast rural areas and some cities at the present stage, are in line with objective needs and have the conditions for existence and development. Democratic women's federations at all levels should cooperate with supply and marketing cooperatives and other relevant departments to provide assistance in terms of raw material sources and product sales, and provide guidance in terms of production technology and product specifications. In pastoral areas, it is necessary to mobilize and organize women to work together with men, divide the work and cooperate, and jointly develop animal husbandry.

    When mobilizing rural women to participate in agricultural production, attention must be paid to helping them implement division of labor and cooperation among family members, so that both production and housework can be done well. Under possible and completely voluntary conditions, organizing nurseries and mutual aid groups for childcare during busy farming seasons is feasible; however, it is obviously completely unworkable to try to make rural women completely get rid of housework all at once.

    Third, in order to mobilize women to participate in industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to eliminate the feudal shackles on women and enable women to actually obtain equal rights and status with men. The completion of this task will greatly increase the enthusiasm of women in labor production, strengthen the ranks of industrial and agricultural production, and tap the potential labor force and reserve force for the planned economic construction that is beginning in the motherland. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to continue to criticize the feudal remnant ideas and traditional customs of valuing men over women, strive for freedom of marriage for men and women, protect the legitimate interests of women, so as to realize equality between men and women and establish a new family that is democratic, harmonious, and united in production.

    In all production enterprises, it is necessary to gradually strive to achieve equal pay for equal work for men and women, and take care of the special difficulties of women. In coordination with the health departments of the People's Government, vigorously publicize and carry out childcare and maternal and child health work, train a large number of midwives and childcare workers, and continuously increase the welfare work for women and children with the continuous improvement of production, so as to protect the health of mothers and infants.

    Here, I want to repeatedly remind comrades that the construction period has begun, production construction is the central work that overrides everything, and the central task of the women's movement is to mobilize women to actively participate in industrial and agricultural production.

    Fourth, universally carry out education and learning movements among women to gradually eliminate illiteracy, improve culture, and learn the skills to participate in production and serve society. At the same time, combined with the learning of production technology and cultural learning, strengthen the ideological education of patriotism and internationalism, and improve the political awareness of the broad masses of women.

    Fifth, in order to adapt to the requirements of national construction, our country is preparing for general elections, and the Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and local people's congresses at all levels also stipulates that "women have the same rights to vote and to be elected as men." Women across the country should warmly support and correctly implement the Election Law, actively participate in the election movement, and work seriously and enthusiastically to victoriously complete the first general election in the country, and elect representatives who have contact with the masses and can truly work for the people, especially female representatives who can truly safeguard the interests of women, to the people's congresses at all levels.

    In addition, Chinese women should continue to work hard to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, unite under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation, actively participate in the international women's peace and democratic movement, further expand and strengthen contacts with women in various countries around the world, do a good job in uniting international friends, care for and support the struggle of all oppressed women to strive for freedom and equality, and actively strive for and defend world peace and the happy life of women and children.

    In multi-ethnic areas, it is necessary to implement the policy of equality and unity among ethnic groups, strengthen the unity of women of all ethnic groups, attach importance to the training of women cadres of ethnic groups, combine with the central work of each ethnic group according to the actual situation and characteristics of each ethnic group, and steadily advance women's work. Do not mechanically apply the experiences and methods of the Han nationality or other regions.

    In order to complete the above-mentioned tasks, democratic women's organizations across the country and all women workers must conscientiously improve their working methods and ideological style, face the masses, go deep into the grassroots, deep into factories and enterprises, deep into rural areas, and deep into streets, and further educate and organize the broad masses of urban and rural women. In terms of working methods, it is necessary to be good at obtaining the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels and the People's Governments at all levels, understand the complexity of women's work, and women's work is related to many aspects, which requires us to be good at coordinating with relevant departments and groups, cooperating, and obtaining assistance. We should often put forward specific work suggestions to the relevant parties in order to obtain conditions for comprehensively carrying out women's work. In carrying out central work and other various works, women's work should be carried out in combination, and all relevant departments should be promoted to strengthen women's work within their respective scopes, give full play to the strength of women, do a good job in the work of the department itself, and also do a good job in women's work. More importantly, we should maintain close contact with the broad masses of women, strengthen investigation and research, proceed steadily from the actual situation of women at the time and place, experience the requirements and creations of the masses, seize the typical, summarize experience, and promote the general. Criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, should be vigorously carried out, and the just criticism from the masses of women should be valued and supported, so as to overcome and prevent bureaucracy and commandism in work at any time.

    Over the past four years, China's women's movement has been successful and the experience created is rich, but we must face the serious shortcomings and errors that still exist in the work of democratic women's organizations, especially the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. There is a problem of bureaucracy that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. The guidance on the work of democratic women's federations at all levels only has general calls and lacks specific guidance, only has work deployment and lacks thorough inspection. In the future, we must overcome this bureaucratic problem and make women's work develop further and achieve greater achievements.

    In the future, we must work under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, consolidate existing achievements, fully utilize the experience we have gained, mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to unite with the people of the whole country, and strive to complete the tasks given to us by the motherland! Strive for greater achievements in the Chinese women's movement!

    四年来中国妇女运动的基本总结和今后任务
    ——在中国第二次全国妇女代表大会上的报告摘要
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席  邓颖超
    从一九四九年三月召开的中国第一次全国妇女代表大会到现在，中华全国民主妇女联合会的各级组织在毛泽东主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导之下，贯彻执行了中国第一次全国妇女代表大会的决议，发动和组织了各族妇女群众与全国人民一道，首先把反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命斗争进行到底，积极支援了中国人民解放战争，解放了全国大陆，建立了独立的统一的中华人民共和国。接着，又积极参加了伟大的抗美援朝运动、各种社会改革工作和国家的各项建设事业。在这些运动和这些工作中，中华全国民主妇女联合会的各级组织特别注意执行了以发动和组织妇女参加生产为中心的方针。
    四年来，我国妇女运动已经获得很大成绩，广大妇女群众的觉悟已经普遍提高，团结已经加强，组织已经扩大。全国各省、市以及绝大多数县份都已经成立了民主妇女联合会。各兄弟民族地区正在建立妇女组织。内蒙古自治区和新疆省的民主妇女联合会都已经培养了一批各民族的妇女干部；西藏也已在今年三月成立了西藏爱国妇女联谊会筹备委员会。
    随着我国人民革命的伟大胜利和祖国建设事业的发展，广大妇女群众和妇女干部的共同努力，妇女们取得了和男子平等的地位与权利。
    四年来，我国妇女参加农业生产的热情大大提高，参加的人数逐年增加，并有相当数量的农村劳动妇女参加了互助合作组织，使妇女能以劳动者的身份参加生产，男女分工合作，又使妇女能担任比较适合自己体力的劳动，并向男农民学习，不断提高技术，增进妇女在生产上的作用，因而能逐渐帮助妇女解决参加生产和抚育儿女的矛盾，保护妇女的健康，逐步提高妇女的地位。
    四年来，由于我国国民经济的恢复与发展，为妇女参加经济建设开辟了宽广的道路，参加工业建设的女职工逐年增加着。她们以极大的热情，参加爱国主义生产竞赛，学习苏联的先进经验，发挥高度的创造性，证明了妇女职工是新中国工业建设的一支重要的力量。在纺织业中，女工人数约占全体工人的百分之六十强，郝建秀工作方法的创造和推广，是纺织工业的一个重要事件；去年就出现了二万多名优秀的郝建秀工作者，提高了纺织品的数量和质量，降低了成本，为国家节省了大量财富。还有不少妇女参加了从来没有妇女参加过的生产部门。经过她们的努力学习，艰苦工作，出现了许多新人新事。掌握重工业技术的女职工，正在逐年的增加。
    新中国人民民主政权保障了妇女与男子有平等的政治权利，并创造了各种条件使妇女群众能实现这种权利，在各级政权机构中，都有妇女被选为人民代表与政府工作人员。在中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军中，有大批女干部和女战士正在前线和后方，艰苦奋斗，积极工作，努力学习，有了重大贡献。有更大量的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，她们鼓励亲人参军，而自己在后方努力生产，养老育小，使部队里的亲人更加英勇地抗美援朝保卫祖国。
    中国妇女获得了和男子同等受教育的机会，特别是由于实行了土地改革及工厂矿山企业民主改革运动以后，改善了工人农民的生活，工农劳动人民的儿女大批入学，真正使妇女获得了和男子同等入学的机会。目前，各种学校中女学生的人数都在增加，并有大批妇女担任光荣的教育工作。在医药卫生事业和爱国卫生运动中，妇女更成为一支重要力量。
    新中国成立以后，重男轻女的封建思想和传统习俗已经失掉了存在的政治经济基础。在今年的贯彻婚姻法运动中，党、政机关和妇女团体的干部，特别是掌管婚姻事务的干部以及区、乡、村的干部，普遍学习了“中华人民共和国婚姻法”；他们在思想上有了进步，开始重视了贯彻执行婚姻法工作，为长期贯彻婚姻法的工作创造了有利条件。从全国各地的农村、街道、工厂中所进行的贯彻婚姻法工作及在群众中普遍进行的宣传工作来看，凡是工作做得较好的地区，都大大提高了群众的觉悟，使他们认识了强迫包办、男尊女卑的封建主义婚姻制度的害处和婚姻自由、男女平等的新民主主义婚姻制度的好处。不少原来夫妻不和、婆媳不睦的家庭，经过调解，也改善了关系。但是必须认识完全改变重男轻女的传统思想和风俗习惯，只有经过长期的细致深入的工作才能达到。
    在我国，母亲和儿童得到了国家的关怀和必要的保护。在劳动保险条例上，规定了女工在产前产后休假五十六天，工资照发。女工及男工家属生育时，可以领到生育补助金。在全国范围内，现已设立的接生站、妇幼保健站及产科医院将近三万处；训练和改造了接生员二十六万九千余名，并提倡新法育儿及普遍接种牛痘等等。四年来儿童保育事业有很大的发展，在工厂矿山和企业机关中，在农村中，托儿组织都有了很大发展。
    四年来，中国妇女积极参加了国际妇女的进步活动。中国妇女在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，积极支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军；并积极响应了世界和平理事会及国际民主妇女联合会的一切号召，踊跃参加和平宣言和要求五大国签订和平公约的签名运动及其他各项保卫世界和平与保卫妇女儿童权利的活动。中国妇女与五十三个国家的妇女建立了联系。中国妇女已经成为世界妇女和平民主运动中的一支重要力量。
    上述各方面的事实，说明了四年来中国妇女运动已经有了伟大的成就，证明了广大妇女群众能够在保卫和平与建设祖国的事业中有伟大的贡献。只要在各种实际工作中，经过适应于她们的具体条件的必要的步骤并运用多种多样的形式，而把她们发动和组织起来，她们便能和男子一样地逐步克服困难，完成祖国交给她们的各种任务，并提高自身的地位。
    总结四年来中国妇女运动，有以下四点主要经验：
    第一，中国妇女运动所以能够获得上述的成就，是因为把妇女解放的事业与国家和人民的整个事业结合起来。我们发动和组织了妇女群众，与男子团结一致，共同努力，完成中共中央和中央人民政府在各个时期向全国人民提出的中心任务。通过各项中心工作，提高了妇女的觉悟，锻炼了妇女的能力，团结了妇女的力量，并以此来实际教育那些歧视妇女和不重视妇女的人们。
    第二，我们执行了以发动和组织妇女参加生产为妇女工作的中心的方针，逐步使广大妇女成为新中国的建设者。经验证明：动员和组织妇女群众参加生产，是促进男女平等地位、彻底解放妇女的基本关键。我们应该反复着重地说，这是妇女解放运动的长期的根本任务。当然，为了充分发动和组织妇女参加生产，不仅应当动员她们直接参加工业、农业及其他各种生产事业，而且也应当动员她们参加文化教育、医务卫生和儿童保育等事业，为发展生产服务。
    第三，在男女一齐发动执行和完成全国人民的中心任务时，在大量组织妇女参加工农业生产时，必须特别注意帮助和教育妇女群众，以提高她们的觉悟和能力；并从妇女生活的实际情况出发，照顾妇女的特殊困难，如抚育儿女和家务负担的困难以及因妇女生理上的特殊而来的困难，并根据当时当地的需要与可能，积极地适当地帮助她们克服这些困难。而对于阻碍妇女参加中心工作和生产事业的封建残余思想和传统习俗，必须用说理方法加以批评，从而使妇女问题能够逐步地得到解决。
    第四，因为妇女工作是一件复杂的关联到各个方面的工作，这就要求各级民主妇女联合会进行工作时，要有适当的工作方法。首先是必须派遣得力干部，参加为完成中心任务而设立的工作机构，以便随时反映妇女群众的情况，提出在妇女中进行工作的意见和经验，协助各级领导机关统一布置和贯彻妇女工作任务。民主妇女联合会更应主动地联合各有关机关和团体，分工合作，共同解决某一个妇女问题，完成一定时期的妇女工作任务。
    由于有了毛泽东主席和中国共产党的正确领导，有了中央和地方各级人民政府的关怀和支持，有了各民族各民主阶级妇女的亲密团结，有了广大妇女群众和干部的共同努力，创造了丰富的经验，使中国妇女工作逐步地向前推进。
    我们伟大的祖国已进入新的历史时期，国家建设已经开始。大力发动和组织广大妇女，充分发挥潜在力量，参加工农业生产和祖国各方面的建设，是今后妇女运动的中心任务。
    为实现这一个任务，第一，在城市中，民主妇女联合会必须督促并帮助工会做好女工工作，动员组织女工积极参加爱国增产节约运动，认真学习苏联先进经验，为提高劳动生产率，学习和掌握先进技术，节约原料，提高产品质量而努力。
    为充分发挥女工劳动生产积极性，在目前生产条件下，凡属可能解决的女工的安全生产、劳动保护及其他特殊问题，民主妇女联合会应督促并帮助工会争取得到适当解决。轻视女工工作，忽视女工的特殊要求和特殊情况，可能解决的问题也不去努力争取解决，是对生产不利的，应该加以纠正。
    教育和组织知识妇女、一切女的科学家、技术人员、文化教育工作者和医务卫生工作者，应该积极学习苏联先进经验，深入农村和工厂矿山，深入群众，深入实际，提高自己，做好工作，为生产服务。
    职工家属的工作和家庭妇女的工作，是城市妇女工作的一个重要方面。民主妇女联合会应该教育母亲们带好孩子、教好孩子，使之成为身心健康的儿童，这是母亲的光荣职责。民主妇女联合会应该教育广大家庭妇女和职工家属搞好家务，并加强学习，提高政治和文化水平，准备好条件，以备祖国需要时，随时参加祖国的各项建设工作。特别是对职工家属，尤应以爱护职工、鼓励职工搞好生产作为她们的光荣任务。对于那些已参加社会活动的职工家属及家庭妇女中的积极分子，要注意照顾家庭劳动的必要时间。
    第二，在农村中做妇女工作，必须围绕农业生产来进行，为农业生产服务，大力发动农村劳动妇女积极参加爱国增产运动和在自愿原则下参加农业互助合作组织；学习和提高农作技术，在积肥、选种、防治病虫害等方面，作出更大的成绩，以提高单位面积产量，增产粮食及其他作物。农村副业生产和手工业生产，在现阶段的广大农村中和一些城市中，是符合客观需要的，有条件存在和发展的。各级民主妇女联合会应协同供销合作社等有关部门在原料来源和产品销路方面予以帮助，在生产技术和产品规格方面予以指导。在牧畜区，要动员和组织妇女与男子一起，分工合作，共同发展畜牧事业。
    在动员农村妇女参加农业生产的时候，必须注意帮助她们在家庭成员间实行分工合作，既要搞好生产，又要搞好家务。在可能的和完全自愿的条件下，组织农忙托儿所和托儿互助组等办法是可行的；但是，企图使农村妇女一下子完全摆脱家务劳动，这显然是完全行不通的。
    第三，为动员妇女参加工农业生产，必须消除对妇女的封建束缚，使妇女在实际上取得与男子平等的权利和地位。这一任务的完成，将大大提高妇女劳动生产的积极性，壮大工农业生产的队伍，为祖国正在开始的计划经济建设发掘出潜在劳动力与后备力量。因此，今后要继续批判男尊女卑的封建残余思想和传统习俗，争取男女婚姻自由，保护妇女的合法利益，以实现男女平等，建立民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭。
    在一切生产企业中必须逐步争取实现男女同工同酬，并照顾妇女的特殊困难。配合人民政府卫生部门大力宣传和开展儿童保育和妇婴卫生工作，大批培养训练助产员和保育员，并随着生产的不断提高，而不断增长妇女儿童福利工作，以保护妇婴健康。
    在这里，我要重复的提醒同志们，建设时期开始了，生产建设是压倒一切的中心工作，妇女运动的中心任务也就是动员妇女积极参加工农业生产。
    第四，普遍开展妇女群众中的教育学习运动，以求逐步扫除文盲、提高文化，学会参加生产和服务社会的本领。同时，结合着生产技术的学习与文化的学习，加强爱国主义与国际主义的思想教育，提高广大妇女群众的政治觉悟。
    第五，为适应国家建设的要求，我们国家正准备普选，中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法又规定了“妇女有与男子同等的选举权和被选举权”。全国妇女应热烈拥护和正确执行选举法，积极参加选举运动，为胜利完成全国第一次普选而严肃热情地工作，选出与人民群众有联系的、真能为人民办事的代表，特别是真能维护妇女利益的女代表到各级人民代表大会中去。
    此外，我们中国妇女应该继续努力支援抗美援朝的斗争，并团结在国际民主妇女联合会的旗帜下，积极参加国际妇女和平民主运动，进一步扩大并加强与世界各国妇女的联系，做好团结国际友人的工作，关心并支援一切被压迫妇女争取自由与平等的斗争，积极地为争取与保卫世界和平与妇女儿童的幸福生活而努力。
    在多民族的地区，必须贯彻执行民族平等团结的政策，加强各族妇女的团结，重视培养民族的妇女干部，根据各族的实际情况、特点，与各民族的中心工作相结合，稳步推进妇女工作，不得机械搬用汉族或其他地区的经验与办法。
    为完成上述任务，全国的民主妇女组织及一切妇女工作者，必须认真地改进工作方法和思想作风，面向群众，深入基层，深入工厂企业，深入农村，深入街道，进一步教育和组织城乡广大妇女群众。在工作方法上，必须善于取得中国共产党各级组织和各级人民政府的领导，必须了解妇女工作的复杂性，妇女工作是与多方面有关联的，这就要求我们善于配合有关部门和团体，协同进行工作，取得帮助。应该经常对有关方面提出工作上的具体建议，以取得全面开展妇女工作的条件。在进行中心工作及其他各项工作中，应结合进行妇女工作，并推动各个有关部门加强其所属范围内的妇女工作，充分发挥妇女的力量，做好该部门的本身工作，也做好妇女工作。更重要的应密切与广大妇女群众的联系，加强调查研究，从当时当地妇女实际情况出发，稳步前进，体验群众的要求和创造，抓着典型，总结经验，推动一般。并应大力开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，重视和支持来自妇女群众的正义批评，以随时克服和防止工作上的官僚主义和命令主义。
    四年来，中国妇女运动是有成就的，创造的经验是丰富的，但是我们必须正视民主妇女组织中，首先是中华全国民主妇女联合会在工作中还存在着严重的缺点和错误，存在着脱离群众脱离实际的官僚主义的毛病，对各级民主妇女联合会的工作指导，只有一般号召，缺乏具体指导，只有工作部署，缺乏周密检查。今后必须克服这种官僚主义的毛病，使妇女工作更向前发展，获得更大的成就。
    今后我们一定要在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，巩固现有成绩，充分运用已得的经验，动员和组织广大妇女群众与全国人民团结一致，为争取完成祖国给与我们的任务而奋斗！为争取中国妇女运动更大的成就而奋斗！
