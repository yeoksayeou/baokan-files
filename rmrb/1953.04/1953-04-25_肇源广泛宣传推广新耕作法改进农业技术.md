Since the autumn harvest of 1952, the CPC Guo'erluosi Houqi (Zhaoyuan) Banner Committee, based on the principle of "general mobilization and focused promotion," has carried out a series of preparatory work to promote new farming methods. In the banner, 93% of villages used practical examples, model selections, and the establishment of technical exhibition rooms in the annual bumper harvest competition to conduct comparative education on new and old farming methods for farmers, and comprehensively promoted new farming methods. During the rural party consolidation, supplementary technical education on promoting mutual aid and cooperation and implementing new farming methods was carried out for party members. After entering the spring plowing preparation stage, all districts and villages adhered to the spirit of "speaking at every meeting and everywhere" to carry out publicity, holding a total of 442 various forums and reports. More than 46,800 people in the banner heard relatively systematic publicity, of which more than 41,900 received general technical instruction. Many people changed their vague and one-sided understanding of new farming methods and initially grasped technical operation knowledge. In addition, the banner and districts trained a large number of production backbones in batches. In the spring plowing preparation stage alone, according to statistics from ten districts, 3,972 male and female mutual aid team leaders, technicians, village cadres, and production activists were trained. The banner centrally trained 600 labor models, 320 village cadres, 440 advanced bumper harvest team leaders, and agricultural production cooperative cadres, and specially trained 234 agricultural technicians, preparing a large number of leaders, backbones, and technical guidance personnel with preliminary technical knowledge for the implementation of new farming methods. Various meetings and training courses widely used the method of "one point, multiple surfaces, and continuous visits" to organize on-site visits to rectified mutual aid groups, material preparation, and technical operation demonstrations, combined with mass thinking to organize forums, so that farmers further realized the superiority of new farming methods, learned new technologies, and greatly increased their enthusiasm for adopting new farming methods, showing a new atmosphere of the patriotic production increase movement.

During the general publicity, some farmers raised the issue that "thinning and topdressing cannot be done in time," believing that the comprehensive adoption of new farming methods and multiple planting were contradictory. The Banner Committee noticed this problem early on, and organized cadres to go deep into Menkeli Village in the Second District to find out the shortcomings and wasted efforts in the implementation of new farming methods last year by carefully calculating accounts, and studied how to tap potential forces from improving sowing work, improving agricultural tools, reasonably arranging the order of planting, widely mobilizing women, and reasonably solving internal problems of mutual aid groups, so that it is possible to comprehensively implement new farming methods on large areas of land. This experience was promoted at the banner rural cadre meeting, which further enhanced the confidence of cadres and masses in adopting new farming methods.

Due to the above series of work, the rectification of mutual aid groups was promoted and technology was further improved, which promoted the spring plowing preparation work of the whole banner. After rectification, 378 temporary mutual aid groups in the banner were upgraded to seasonal or year-round groups, and 272 seasonal groups were upgraded to year-round groups. The proportion of various types of mutual aid groups in the banner changed to: year-round groups accounted for more than 47%, three-season groups accounted for 42%, and temporary groups accounted for more than 10%. Except for 64 individual households, the entire banner was organized and actively carried out spring plowing preparation work. Now all the stubble of the banner has been completely dragged; 91% of the total cultivated area has been selected for seeds, and most of them have been tested for germination. More than 6,100 pieces of stubble cutting machines, pier rollers and seeders for implementing new farming methods have been prepared, and there are 368 sets of improved harrows; 112,600 catties of blood bubble fertilizer and 24.08 million catties of various fertilizers have been prepared, and the manure sent out accounts for more than 62% of the cultivated area. The whole banner has universally started plowing and sowing wheat, and more than 100 mutual aid groups have adopted new farming methods to plant millet.

The current problems in promoting new farming methods are: there is still insufficient manure fertilizer, farmers have not yet universally mastered the technology of operating improved agricultural tools, some internal problems of mutual aid groups have not been well resolved, and the work of mobilizing women has not been universally paid attention to. The Banner Committee is organizing forces to seize the time to solve these problems.

    肇源广泛宣传推广新耕作法改进农业技术
    从一九五二年秋收以来，中共郭尔罗斯后旗（肇源）旗委就根据“普遍号召，重点推广”的方针，进行了一系列的推广新耕作法的准备工作。全旗有百分之九十三的村，在全年丰产评比中用实际事例、评选模范、设立技术展览室等办法，向农民进行了新、旧耕作法的对比教育，全面地宣传了新耕作法。农村整党中，向党员补行了搞好互助合作和实行新耕作法的技术教育。进入备耕阶段后，各区、村坚持“会会讲，处处讲”的精神进行宣传，一共举行了四百四十二次各种座谈会、报告会，全旗有四万六千八百多人听到比较系统的宣传，其中受到一般技术传授的有四万一千九百多人，许多人转变了对新耕作法的模糊的、片面的认识，初步掌握了技术操作知识。此外，旗、区分工分批训练了大批生产骨干，仅在备耕阶段，据十个区统计就先后训练了三千九百七十二名男女互助组长、技术员、村干部和生产积极分子，旗集中训练了六百名劳动模范，三百二十名村干部、四百四十名先进丰产组长和农业生产合作社干部，并专门训练农业技术员二百三十四名，为推行新耕作法准备下大量初具技术知识的领导者、骨干和技术指导人材。各种会议、训练班，都广泛地运用了“一点多面，连环参观”的办法，组织实地参观整顿互助组、物质准备和技术操作表演，结合群众思想组织座谈，使农民进一步认识到新耕作法的优越性，学会新技术，采用新耕作法的积极性大大增涨，出现了爱国增产运动的新气象。
    普遍宣传中，有些地方农民提出“间苗、追肥干不过来”的问题，认为全面采用新耕作法和多种地有矛盾。旗委及早注意到了这个问题，组织干部深入二区孟克里村通过算细账，找出去年实行新耕作法中的缺点和浪费力量的地方，研究从改进播种工作、改良农具、种地合理排开次序、广泛发动妇女、合理解决互助组内部问题等方面，发挥潜在力量，是能够做到在大片土地上全面实行新耕作法的。在全旗农村干部会上推广了这一经验，更加提高了干部、群众采用新耕作法的信心。
    由于做了上述一系列工作，推进了整顿互助组和进一步改进技术，推动了全旗春耕准备工作。全旗的互助组，经过整顿有三百七十八个临时组提高为季节组或常年组，二百七十二个季节组提高为常年组，全旗各种类型互助组的比例改变为：常年组占百分之四十七强，三大季组占百分之四十二，临时组占百分之十强。全旗除了六十四个单干户外，全部组织起来，积极进行春耕准备工作。现在全旗槎子已全部拖完；占总耕地面积百分之九十一的种子选好了，并大部做了发芽试验。准备了实行新耕作法用的割槎子机、墩轱辘和点葫芦六千一百多件，并有三百六十八套改良耲耙；准备了十一万二千六百斤血泡和二千四百零八万斤各种肥料，已送出的粪占耕地面积的百分之六十二强。全旗已普遍开犁种麦，并有一百多个互助组采用新耕作法种谷子了。
    当前推行新耕作法中的问题是：粪肥还不足，农民还没有普遍掌握操作改良农具的技术，有些互助组内部问题没有很好解决，发动妇女工作还没有普遍注意。旗委正组织力量，抓紧解决这些问题。
