[Our Dispatch] The completion of production plans by Tianjin's state-owned and local state-owned factories improved in March compared to January and February. According to statistics, most of the city's forty-three major products have completed their plans. Among them, printed cloth and vulcanized green, which did not complete their plans at all in January and February, overfulfilled their plans in March. Twelve factories under the Local State-Owned Industry Bureau failed to complete their plans in January or February, but completed them in March. Six of these factories even made up for the output not completed in the January and February plans, completing or exceeding their first quarter production plans as scheduled.

The main reasons for the improved plan completion in March are, firstly, that under the supervision of higher-level leaders, many factory leaders began to be alert to the serious situation of not completing the plan in January and February, and promptly checked the implementation of the plan, solving some problems existing in production. Secondly, some factories, after the struggle against false reporting and concealment and against bureaucracy, the leadership began to pay attention to and adopt the rationalization proposals put forward by employees in the formulation of plans. For example, the leading cadres of the state-owned Tianjin Rubber Parts Factory identified the key problems in production and mobilized all employees to find tricks and tap potential. Workers in the rubber mixing group and the car inner tube group proposed methods to improve operations, which improved product quality and enabled the factory to overfulfill its first quarter production plan. Thirdly, some factories began to pay attention to implementing the organizational and technical measures plans made in the formulation of plans. For example, the state-owned Tianjin Dyestuff Factory tried out two organizational and technical measures proposed by employees when revising the plan in February, which shortened the production cycle of vulcanized green liquid and greatly reduced the number of unqualified products of vulcanized alkali. As a result, not only did it make up for the output not completed in the January and February plans, but the output of vulcanized green exceeded the plan for the entire quarter by 5.21%, and vulcanized alkali also exceeded the planned output by 6.62%.

Among the factories that overfulfilled the first quarter plan, such as the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, Bicycle Factory, Automobile Parts Factory, and some cotton textile factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau, basically achieved balanced monthly production. The main experience of these factories in balanced production is that the majority of employees carefully discussed the production plan, formulated organizational and technical measures plans, and gradually implemented them; at the same time, they formulated work plans, carried out scheduling work, and overcame the phenomenon of being lax at the beginning and tight at the end of production.

Although the plan completion situation of Tianjin's state-owned and local state-owned factories improved in March compared to January and February, because many products failed to complete their plans in January and February, the overall production completion situation in the first quarter is still not good enough. Looking at thirty-eight major products, only nineteen of them completed the national plan in the first quarter. The other nineteen have still not completed their plans, especially the completion of plans for machinery, electrical equipment and other products is the worst. For example, the steam boilers produced by the United Machine Factory only completed 40% of the plan, and the diesel engines produced by the Tianjin Machine Factory only completed 8.33%. As for the factories that completed the plan, there is also a common phenomenon of being lax at the beginning and tight at the end. At the same time, the completion of the plan is not comprehensive. For example, some factories completed the product plan, but failed to complete the quality plan; completed the quality plan, but failed to complete the cost plan, etc. The production of cotton textile factories in the first quarter generally did not meet the quality and cost targets. For example, the plan for the rate of first-class cotton cloth was 97.11%, but in reality, only 96.6% was completed.

The reasons why the first quarter plan was not completed well in various factories are that some factories were due to the untimely supply of certain raw materials, some were due to the late determination of tasks, lack of basis for making plans, and the failure to fully mobilize the masses when discussing the plans, resulting in the formulation of advanced plans. More importantly, the management work is weak, especially the plan management work. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen management work to ensure production in the second quarter.

### 天津国营和地方国营工厂三月份生产情况好转

    天津国营和地方国营工厂三月份生产情况好转
    【本报讯】天津市的国营及地方国营工厂三月份完成生产计划情况较一、二月份有好转。据统计全市四十三种主要产品，大部分都已完成计划，其中印花布、硫化青等一、二月份全未完成计划，三月份这些产品都超额完成了计划。地方国营工业局有十二个厂一月份或二月份未完成计划，三月份则完成了计划，其中并有六个厂弥补了一、二月份计划中未完成的产量，如期完成或超额完成了第一季度的生产计划。
    三月份各厂完成计划情况获得好转的主要原因，首先是在上级领导督促下，不少厂领导干部对一、二月份未完成计划的严重情况开始警惕起来，及时检查了执行计划的情况，解决了生产中所存在的一些问题。其次，部分工厂经过了反虚假隐瞒、反官僚主义斗争，领导方面开始注意并采纳了职工在制订计划中提出的合理化建议。如国营天津橡胶配件厂领导干部找出生产中的关键问题，发动全体职工找窍门、挖潜力。炼胶小组、汽车内胎等小组的工人提出改进操作的办法，提高了产品质量，使该厂超额完成了第一季度生产计划。第三，有些厂开始注意实现制订计划中做出的组织技术措施计划。如国营天津染料厂试行了二月份修订计划时职工提出的两项组织技术措施，使硫化青色液生产周期缩短，硫化碱的不合格产品大大减少，因而不但补上了一、二月份计划中未完成的产量，硫化青的产量并超过了全季计划的五点二一，硫化碱也超过计划产量的六点六二。
    在超额完成首季计划的工厂中，如国营天津钢厂、自行车厂、汽车制配厂和华北纺织管理局所属部分棉纺厂等，大体上做到了按月均衡生产。这些厂均衡生产的主要经验是广大职工认真地讨论了生产计划，制订出组织技术措施计划，逐步加以实施；同时制订了作业计划，进行了调度工作，克服了生产中的前松后紧的现象。
    天津市国营及地方国营工厂三月份计划完成情况较一、二月份虽有好转，但因一、二两月很多产品未完成计划，就第一季度整个的情况看来，生产完成的情况仍是不够好的。以三十八种主要产品看来，其中第一季度完成国家计划的只有十九种。另外十九种仍未完成计划，特别是机械、电工器材等产品完成计划情况最坏。如联合机器厂所产蒸汽锅炉仅完成计划的百分之四十，天津机器厂所产柴油机仅完成了百分之八点三三。至于完成计划的各厂也较普遍地存在前松后紧的现象。同时完成计划的情况也不是全面的，如有的厂完成了产品计划，却完不成质量计划，完成了质量计划，又完不成成本计划等。棉纺各厂第一季度的生产普遍未达到质量指标和成本指标，如棉布正布率计划为百分之九十七点一一，实际上只完成了百分之九十六点六。
    各厂第一季度计划完成情况不好的原因，有些工厂是因某些原材料供应不及时，有些是任务确定较晚，作计划缺乏依据，而在讨论计划时又未充分发动群众，制订先进的计划。更主要的，则是管理工作薄弱，特别是计划管理工作薄弱。因此必须加强管理工作，保证第二季度的生产。
