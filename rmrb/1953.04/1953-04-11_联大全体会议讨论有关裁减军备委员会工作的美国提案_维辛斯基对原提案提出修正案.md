Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 10th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on April 8 to discuss the proposal submitted by the United States and other countries and adopted by the Political Committee. One of the recommendations in this proposal is to commend the work of the Disarmament Commission.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky made a brief statement before the vote, saying: If the two paragraphs concerning commendation of the work of the Disarmament Commission and reaffirmation of the resolution adopted by the Sixth UN General Assembly on this issue are deleted from the Political Committee's recommendation, then this recommendation will be acceptable to the Soviet delegation. Vyshinsky urged the Assembly to adopt the Soviet amendment to delete these two paragraphs. He said that this would make it possible for the Assembly to reach an agreement on the most important substantive part of the resolution.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying: It is hoped that other delegations will make concessions to the Soviet representatives on such important issues, just as the Soviet delegation is making concessions to them. In this way, a path to agreement will be opened up for other outstanding issues. Indonesian representative Sudjarwo firmly supported the Soviet amendment. He said that if the Assembly accepts the Soviet amendment, it may provide a basis for agreement among the major powers, which could help eliminate mutual suspicion and enable real progress on the issue of disarmament.

The Czechoslovak delegation also supported the Soviet amendment.

British representative Jebb agreed to accept the Soviet amendment to delete the part commending the Disarmament Commission. However, Jebb opposed the amendment to delete the part concerning the Sixth General Assembly resolution.

US representative Gross rejected both amendments proposed by the Soviet Union.

Representatives of the Ukrainian Republic, India, Lebanon, Argentina, and Syria, who spoke successively, all expressed their agreement with the Soviet amendment, while Brazil, Peru, Australia, and Colombia supported the British proposal.

Lebanese representative Azkoul said: Passing the proposal as amended by the Soviet Union would not deprive the Disarmament Commission of its powers, as this is specifically stipulated in the second paragraph of the text of the proposal under consideration by the Assembly.

Vyshinsky spoke for a second time, saying that US representative Gross took that position out of misunderstanding. He said: Gross apparently believed that if the Sixth General Assembly resolution is no longer cited, the significance of this resolution would be diminished. But that is not the case. Vyshinsky said: The Soviet Union would not think that if the 1952 resolution is no longer reaffirmed, it means that the United States no longer supports this resolution. He once again urged the Assembly to support the Soviet amendment in order to improve the atmosphere of cooperation.

The Assembly then voted on the proposal. The Assembly agreed without opposition to include the first Soviet amendment in the proposal. However, the second amendment was rejected by a vote of 10 to 33, with 13 abstentions.

The motion to reaffirm the paragraph on the Sixth General Assembly resolution was passed by a vote of 38 to 6, with 16 abstentions. The overall vote on the proposal was 52 in favor, 5 against, and 3 abstentions.

    联大全体会议讨论有关裁减军备委员会工作的美国提案
    维辛斯基对原提案提出修正案
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会在四月八日举行全体会议，讨论了美国及其他国家提出并为政治委员会通过的提案，这个提案中的建议之一是表扬裁减军备委员会的工作。
    苏联代表维辛斯基在表决之前发表简短声明说：如果从政治委员会建议中删去关于表扬裁军委员会的工作以及重申联合国第六届大会在这个问题上通过的决议案的两段，那么这个建议将为苏联代表团所接受。维辛斯基敦促大会通过苏联的修正案，把这两段删去。他说，这样将使大会有可能在决议案的最重要的实质的部分达成协议。
    维辛斯基最后表示：希望其他代表团在这样重大的问题上对苏联代表有所让步，如同苏联代表团正在向他们让步一样。这样，将为其他悬而未决的问题打开一条取得协议的道路。印度尼西亚代表苏加沃坚决支持苏联的修正案。他说，如果大会接受苏联的修正案，可能为大国提供一个协议的基础，这样能有助于消除彼此的猜疑，并使裁军问题获得真正的进展。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团也支持苏联的修正案。
    英国代表杰伯同意接受苏联提出的删去对裁军委员会的表扬的那部分修正。但是杰伯反对删去关于第六届大会决议案的那部分修正。
    美国代表葛罗斯对苏联提出的两点修正都表示拒绝。
    继起发言的乌克兰共和国、印度、黎巴嫩、阿根廷和叙利亚的代表都表示同意苏联的修正案，而巴西、秘鲁、澳大利亚和哥伦比亚则赞成英国的主张。
    黎巴嫩代表阿兹考尔说：通过由苏联加以修正的提案，并不会剥夺裁军委员会的职权，因为大会正在审议的提案的正文第二段里面对此已有特别规定。
    维辛斯基第二次发言说：美国代表葛罗斯所以采取那种立场是出于误会。他说：葛罗斯显然以为：如果不再引述第六届大会的决议案，这个决议案的意义便会减弱了。但是事情并不是这样。维辛斯基说：苏联并不会认为：如果不再重申一九五二年的决议案就表示美国已不再支持这个决议案了。他再次敦促大会支持苏联的修正案，以便增进合作的空气。
    大会然后对这个提案进行表决。大会未经反对同意把苏联第一点修正案列入提案中。但是第二点修正案却以十票对三十三票、十三票弃权而被否决。
    主张重申第六届大会决议案一段，以三十八票对六票、十六票弃权而被通过。整个提案的表决结果是五十二票赞成、五票反对、三票弃权。
