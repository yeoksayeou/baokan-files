Jiangxi Province Establishes Election Committee
Provincial People's Government Summarizes Three Years of Democratic Governance Work
[This newspaper reports] The 14th meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Committee was held on April 1st. At the meeting, the committee listened to the report by Zhu Kaiquan, Director of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, relaying Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping's report on conducting general elections. Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, Fang Zhichun, also gave a summary report on the province's three years of democratic governance work. The meeting also approved the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Election Committee, with Fang Zhichun, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, serving as Chairman. The members of the Election Committee include representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and ethnic minorities.

In his summary report, Vice Chairman Fang Zhichun pointed out that Jiangxi Province has made considerable achievements in democratic governance over the past three years. Since the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government in June 1949, symposiums with representatives from all walks of life have been continuously convened. On August 27, 1950, the first session of the first Jiangxi Provincial People's Representative Conference was held, exercising the functions and powers of the Provincial People's Congress. All six cities in the province have convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life, with the most having convened eighteen times and the least five times, exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress, and electing the Municipal People's Government Committee, the Mayor, and the Municipal Consultative Committee. All 82 counties and the Lushan Special District in the province have also generally convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life, generally convening eight to ten times. Except for Wan'an, Dongxiang, Taihe, Xingan, Yushan, Wuning, Xingzi, Pengze, Anfu counties and the Lushan Special District, all have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, electing the County People's Government Committee, the County Head, and the County Standing Committee. All 9,994 townships in the province have generally convened township people's representative conferences, exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress. Townships generally convened meetings once per quarter. The majority of the townships directly elected representatives to convene the township People's Congress, electing the township People's Government Committee and the township head. In ethnic minority areas, people's representative conferences from all walks of life were convened, and ethnic minority autonomous township people's governments were established (such as the She ethnic group in Guixi, Qianshan, and Xingguo).

Initially, the representatives to the people's representative conferences from all walks of life were recommended by the people and invited by the government. Later, through the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and various social reform movements, as well as the restoration of industrial and agricultural production and the stabilization of finance and prices, the political awareness of the broad masses of the people was continuously raised, and various mass organizations became increasingly sound. Furthermore, after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the ideological remolding of intellectuals, the masses gained considerable experience in democratic elections, and the broad masses of the people gradually became familiar with and understood their political representatives. After this, the method of producing representatives to the people's representative conferences from all walks of life gradually transitioned from recommendation and invitation to direct and indirect elections by the people. On this basis, the people's representative conferences from all walks of life in various cities and counties gradually exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, electing government committees, consultative committees, and standing committees. The broad masses of the people not only enthusiastically participated in the elections, but also very seriously elected their representatives. Old men and women who usually only cared about production and rarely asked about things eagerly participated in the meetings when they heard about the election of representatives. They said, "This is our right to be masters of the country, and we cannot give it up no matter what." In the Houjin Township of the Fifth District of Gan County, when Li Guolin and Xu Aihua were nominated as representative candidates, the masses said, "Both of them are good, but Li Guolin can better represent the opinions of the entire masses, and can also convey the spirit and resolutions of the meeting upon his return." In the end, Li Guolin was elected. In Lichuan County, the street director of the Second Street in the urban area monopolized the election. The masses said on the spot, "We have the right to vote, you cannot monopolize and substitute for us." They brought this matter up for discussion at the meeting, and the meeting passed a resolution to remove the street director from his post. This shows that the broad masses of the people have further realized the importance of political power from their personal experience in the revolutionary struggle, and realized the truth that the basic issue of the revolution is the issue of political power. The representatives elected by the people not only carefully listened to the government's work reports at the people's representative conferences from all walks of life in the province and in various counties, cities, and townships exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress, but also conducted serious discussions and reviews. They unanimously praised the achievements in various tasks; and they put forward strict criticisms and accusations regarding the shortcomings and errors in various tasks; and resolutely struggled against certain elements of bureaucracy, commandism, violations of law and discipline, and bad people and bad deeds. For example, at the People's Representative Conference of Leping County, representatives exposed many illegal acts of Yu Guanghua, a work team member in the county, such as tying up and beating people, and the meeting unanimously passed a resolution to dismiss Yu Guanghua from his post. The people's representative conferences from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province and in various counties, cities, and townships exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress not only carefully reviewed the government's past work, but also particularly seriously determined the current work guidelines and tasks. For example, the People's Representative Conference of Pingxiang County convened last spring focused on the high-yield movement as the central agenda item of the meeting. After extensive discussion by the representatives, it was decided to put forward the slogan of "50,000 mu at 1,000 jin per mu, 5,000 households at 1,000 jin per household." This slogan immediately became a practical action slogan for the broad masses of the people throughout the county. As a result, the county became a high-yield model county in the province last year. Last autumn, the People's Representative Conference from all walks of life convened in Guangfeng County focused on discussing the issue of public grain. After the meeting, the task of over 20 million jin of public grain in the county was completed in its entirety in four and a half days. At the first People's Representative Conference from all walks of life exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress in Leping County last year, representatives criticized the serious compulsory and commanding style of certain cadres when mobilizing the masses to grow cotton: Insufficient publicity and guidance in advance, the masses intercropped beans in the cotton fields, and the cadres, fearing that it would affect the growth of cotton, forced the masses to pull out the beans. The masses were unwilling to pull them out, so the cadres went to pull them out themselves; when the cotton matured, the cooperatives and trade departments reduced the price of cotton during acquisition, causing the broad masses of people to suffer great losses and causing dissatisfaction. Therefore, the meeting took this issue as the central topic, and after discussion, widely unfolded criticism and self-criticism, and finally passed a resolution on the reasonable adjustment of cotton prices, which was unanimously supported by the masses, ensuring the continued planting of cotton and the completion of the tasks given by the state. The people's representative conferences from all walks of life in various counties and cities exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress were even more serious and cautious about elections. The representative of the Ninth District of Leping County nominated Cheng Zhengxu as a candidate for deputy county head, but some representatives believed that "Cheng Zhengxu is old and not very capable. It is better to elect Yang, the section chief of the county government, who is young and has a good style." After much debate, a representative was specially sent to Cheng Zhengxu's hometown to conduct an investigation. The representative returned and said, "Cheng Zhengxu led the revolutionary work in the county during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War; after the Red Army went north, he was imprisoned five times, suffered greatly, and after coming out, he has been working at home and often told the masses about the benefits of the Communist Party and the Red Army. He has a very strong backbone and is now the chairman of the peasant association and his work performance is good." As a result, it was unanimously passed that Cheng Zhengxu be the deputy county head. In addition, a representative nominated the director of the county hospital as a candidate for member of the county government, but one representative said, "The doctors in the hospital are very bureaucratic and look down on the working people." This caused a dispute among the representatives. One representative testified: "The director himself is a good cadre, very concerned about the working people, and sometimes he personally sees patients at night; it is true that some doctors in the hospital are not good, but he cannot be completely blamed. This is because he does not lead the doctors well and there are shortcomings in his work. We will bring this up to him, and if he does not change, we will not elect him next time." In the end, everyone agreed with this opinion. During the election of government committee members at the People's Representative Conference of Jiujiang County, one representative resolutely did not vote for Deputy County Head Gao. He said, "When Deputy County Head Gao was the Minister of Propaganda of the County Party Committee, he beat people in our township and his work style was not good. I do not agree to elect him."

Over the past three years, due to the establishment and gradual improvement of people's representative conferences from all walks of life, which represented the will and revolutionary interests of the broad masses of the people, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people has been brought into play, and the progress of work has been promoted. After three years of practical training, the broad masses of the people have considerable experience in democratic elections, which has prepared favorable conditions for the realization of the election law and the welcoming of the convocation of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels.

    江西省成立选举委员会
    省人民政府总结了三年来民主建政工作
    【本报讯】四月一日江西省人民政府委员会召开第十四次会议。会上听取了省民政厅厅长朱开铨传达邓小平副总理关于进行普选的报告，省人民政府方志纯副主席并作了关于全省三年来民主建政工作的总结报告。会议并通过成立江西省选举委员会，由省人民政府副主席方志纯担任主席。选举委员会的委员中包括各民主党派、各人民团体和少数民族的代表。
    方志纯副主席在总结报告中指出：过去三年来江西省的民主建政工作有不少成绩。江西省人民政府一九四九年六月成立后，即不断地召开各界人民代表座谈会。一九五○年八月二十七日，召开了全省第一届第一次各界人民代表会议，代行了省人民代表大会职权。全省六个市都已召开了各界人民代表会议，多的召开了十八次，最少的也召开了五次，并代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了市人民政府委员会、市长及市协商委员会。全省共计八十二个县，一个庐山特区，也普遍召开了各界人民代表会议，召开的次数，一般的是八次到十次。除了万安、东乡、泰和、新淦、玉山、武寗、星子、彭泽、安福等九县和庐山特区外，都代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了县人民政府委员会、县长及县常务委员会。全省共计九千九百九十四个乡，均普遍召开了乡人民代表会议，代行了人民代表大会的职权。各乡召开的次数一般是每季一次。其中大部分乡均由人民直接选举代表，召开了全乡人民代表大会，选举了乡人民政府委员会和乡长。在少数民族的地区，召开了少数民族各界人民代表会议，成立了少数民族自治乡人民政府（如贵溪、铅山、兴国之畬族）。
    起初，各界人民代表会议的代表是由各界人民群众推选和政府邀请的。以后经过抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命及各种社会改革运动，以及工农业生产的恢复，金融物价的稳定，广大人民政治觉悟日益提高，各种群众组织日益健全，更经过伟大的“三反”“五反”运动与知识分子的思想改造，群众对于民主选举有了相当经验，广大人民群众逐渐熟悉和了解他们中间的政治代表人物。此后各界人民代表会议的代表产生方法，也就逐渐由推选和邀请过渡到人民直接和间接选举。在这个基础上，各市、县各界人民代表会议便逐渐代行人民代表大会职权，选举了政府委员会、协商委员会和常务委员会。广大人民群众不仅踊跃参加选举，而且十分认真选举自己的代表。平时只顾生产、很少问事的老头子老太婆听到要选举代表，都踊跃地来参加会议。他们说：“这是我们做国家主人的权利，无论如何我也不能放弃。”赣县第五区后进乡群众选出李国麟、徐爱华为代表候选人，当时群众说：“两个人都行，但李国麟更能代表全体群众说话，回来又能传达会议的精神和决议。”最后是李国麟当选了。黎川县城区二街街长包办选举，群众当场说：“我们有选举权，你不能包办代替。”并把这件事提到会议上讨论，经会议通过，撤了这个街长的职。这就说明了广大群众已从革命斗争的切身经验中进一步认识到政权的重要性，认识到革命的基本问题就是政权问题这一真理。由人民选举出来的代表，在省及各县、市、乡代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议上，不仅认真听取政府的工作报告，而且进行了认真的讨论和审查。对于各项工作成绩，一致提出了表扬；对于各项工作中的缺点错误，则提出了严格的批评和指责；对某些官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的分子和坏人坏事，坚决进行了斗争。例如：在乐平县各界人民代表会议上，代表揭发了该县工作队员余光华捆人打人等许多违法行为，会议
    一致通过给余光华撤职处分。江西省及各县市乡代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议不仅认真检查了政府过去的工作，而且特别认真地决定了当前的工作方针和任务。例如：萍乡县去年春召开各界人民代表会议，以丰产运动为会议中心议程，经过代表们广泛讨论，决定提出“千斤五万亩、千斤五千户”的号召。这一号召马上变为全县广大群众实际行动的口号，结果该县去年成为全省的丰产模范县。广丰县去年秋在全县召开的各界人民代表会议上，以讨论公粮问题为中心。会后四天半全县两千多万斤公粮任务全部完成。乐平县去年第一次代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议上，代表批评了某些干部动员群众种棉花时的严重强迫命令作风：事先宣传指导不够，群众在棉花地里夹种了豆子，干部怕影响棉花的生长，就强迫群众拔豆子，群众不愿拔，干部就亲自去拔；到棉花成熟时，合作社与贸易部门收购，又将棉价降低，使广大群众亏了大本，引起不满。因此，这次会议就以这个问题为中心议题，经过了会议讨论，广泛地展开了批评与自我批评，最后通过了对棉价合理调整的决议，获得了群众一致的拥护，保证继续种棉花，完成国家给予的任务。代行人民代表大会职权的各县市各界人民代表会议，对于选举更为认真慎重。乐平县九区代表提出程正旭为副县长候选人，但有的代表认为：“程正旭年老，能力不强，不如选县府杨科长，既年青，作风又好。”彼此争论不下，最后专门派了代表去程正旭的家乡进行调查，代表回来说：“程正旭在第二次国内革命战争时期领导过全县革命工作；红军北上后，他坐了五次牢，吃尽了苦，出来后，一直在家劳动，并经常对群众说共产党和红军的好处，骨头很硬，现在是农协主席，工作表现不错。”结果一致通过程正旭为副县长。另外有一个代表提出了该县卫生院院长为该县县政府委员候选人，但有一个代表说：“卫生院的医生官僚气十足，瞧不起劳动人民。”当时引起了代表们的争论，有一个代表证明：“院长本人是一个好干部，很关心劳动人民，有时他亲自在夜晚给病人看病；院里某些医生不好是事实，但不能完全怪他，这是他对医生领导不够，工作上有缺点，我们给他提出来，如果不改，下次就不选他。”最后大家都同意了这个意见。九江县各界人民代表会议在选举政府委员时，有一个代表坚决不投高副县长的票，他说：“高副县长从前当县委宣传部长时，在我们乡里打过人，作风不好，我不同意选他。”
    三年多来，由于各界人民代表会议的建立和逐步健全，代表了广大人民的意志和革命的利益，因此发扬了广大人民的积极性，推动了工作的进展。经过三年来的实际锻炼，广大人民群众对民主选举已有相当的经验，这就为实现选举法，迎接全国及地方各级人民代表大会的召开，准备了有利条件。
