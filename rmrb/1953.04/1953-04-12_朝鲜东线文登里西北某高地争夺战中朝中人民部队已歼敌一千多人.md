Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 11th: The battle for a nameless high ground northwest of the 883.7 high ground near Bianyan-ri, northwest of Mundong-ri on the eastern Korean front, is still raging fiercely. From the night of April 1st to the morning of April 9th, our army has annihilated more than 1,000 soldiers of the Li Syngman army's 3rd Division.

　　At 11:20 PM on the night of April 1st, our army's powerful artillery group launched a fierce fire raid on this nameless high ground. Following this, our infantry charged up the smoke-filled mountain top. At this moment, the remaining enemy troops scurried into the tunnels. Our soldiers bravely braved the enemy's artillery fire and destroyed all of their tunnel entrances, wiping out most of an enemy platoon.

　　On the 2nd and 3rd, the enemy launched tentative counterattacks with a squad and two platoons respectively, but were repelled by our army. On the afternoons of the 4th and 5th, the enemy army launched group assaults with two companies and a battalion under the cover of artillery fire, but were also repelled by our army.

　　The enemy army took a breather on the 6th, preparing for new actions. Before dawn on the 7th, the enemy army launched an attack with five platoons, but were again repelled by our army. Afterwards, the enemy army concentrated its artillery fire on our positions, and at 2:00 PM, launched an attack in multiple directions with a battalion, but all three assaults were repelled by our army as they approached our positions. During the fourth assault, the enemy briefly broke into one of our forward fortifications, but our soldiers immediately launched a heroic counterattack on the position, driving the enemy back. The fierce fighting stopped at 5:00 PM, with the enemy suffering over 650 casualties, leaving over 250 bodies behind. On the 8th, the enemy army, with the cooperation of a large number of aircraft and eleven tanks, launched three fierce attacks, fighting fiercely for a whole day, but still could not climb the mountain top.

　　By the morning of the 9th, the total number of casualties for the Li Syngman army's 3rd Division had reached over 1,000, and it had even deployed its reserve force, the 22nd Regiment, into the battle. Our soldiers said: Let them send more, we have prepared enough shells and bullets!

    朝鲜东线文登里西北某高地争夺战中朝中人民部队已歼敌一千多人
    【新华社朝鲜前线十一日电】朝鲜东线文登里西北边岩里附近八八三点七高地西北一个无名高地的争夺战，仍在激烈进行。自四月一日夜到九日上午，我军已歼灭李伪军第三师一千多人。
    四月一日夜里十一时二十分，我军强大炮群对这个无名高地进行猛烈的火力急袭，接着，我军步兵冲上硝烟弥漫的山头。这时，残敌慌忙钻进坑道。我军战士勇敢地冒着敌人的炮火，炸毁了他们所有的坑道口，守敌一个排大部被歼灭。
    二日和三日，敌人先后以一个班和两个排的兵力进行试探性反扑，都被我军击退。四日和五日下午，敌军以两个连和一个营的兵力，在炮火掩护下发起集团冲锋，也被我军击退。
    敌军在六日喘息了一天，准备新的行动。七日天明前，敌军以五个排兵力发起攻击，又被我军击退。以后，敌军又集中炮火向我猛轰，并于下午二时，以一个营兵力分路发起攻击，三次冲锋都在接近阵地时被我军击退。敌军在第四次冲锋时，曾突入我一个前沿工事；我军战士立即以英勇的阵地反冲锋将敌人击退。激战在下午五时停止，敌军伤亡六百五十多名，弃尸二百五十多具。八日，敌军又以一个营的兵力在大批飞机和十一辆坦克的配合下，进行三次猛扑，激战一整天，仍然不能爬上山头。
    到九日上午，李伪军第三师死伤总数已达一千多人，把它的预备队——二十二团也调上来投入了战斗。我军战士们说：叫它再多来些吧，我们已经准备好了足够的炮弹和子弹！
