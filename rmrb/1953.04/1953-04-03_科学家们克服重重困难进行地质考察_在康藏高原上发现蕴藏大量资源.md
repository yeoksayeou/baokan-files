Scientists on the Kangzang Plateau, with the warm assistance of the Tibetan people, have discovered abundant resources. For over a year, they have traversed the Hengduan Mountains of Xikang to the lake regions of northern Tibet, from the southern foothills of the Tanggula Mountains to the Himalayas. They have worked in countless deep valleys, ridges, and grasslands, covering a total distance of twenty thousand li. Through preliminary geological surveys, they have discovered dozens of mining areas and more than thirty kinds of minerals on the Kangzang Plateau, including non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, refractory materials, building materials, fuels, and extremely valuable rare metals. For example, the graphite mine discovered in a certain location is a high-quality mine with a large reserve; a certain lake contains a large amount of borax, with very pure quality. The hydropower reserves on the Kangzang Plateau are unlimited. In just one section of the Yarlung Tsangpo River's tributary, about 380 kilometers long, it is possible to generate 600,000 horsepower of electricity. Large areas of forest have been found. One forest area, covering approximately 10,000 square kilometers, has trees with diameters mostly between one and three meters. If the trees were connected end to end, they could stretch approximately 1,800 rows from Chengdu to Lhasa. The scientists also analyzed the soil of the Kangzang Plateau, studied various crops growing in the river valleys, and discovered many excellent pasture grasses.

In order to discover the resources hidden in the motherland, scientists often grasp small trees in stone crevices and climb cliffs on makeshift log ladders. In deep mountains and narrow valleys, they use axes and iron picks to clear the way forward. Sometimes they sweep away snow to camp, and sometimes they sleep under rock ledges. Some gray-haired veteran scientists, like young people, climb rope bridges and slide across rapids. At the end of March last year, one team braved strong winds and waded through waist-deep snow to cross the Banggala Snow Mountain and enter Bomi. Their skin was chapped by the wind, and their hands and feet were frostbitten, but they persisted in their work.

The Tibetan people are very fond of these scientists sent by Chairman Mao. Many remote pastures and Tibetan people in barren valleys, upon hearing the news of their arrival, prepared firewood and erected tents several days in advance to welcome them. Once in Bomi, heavy snow blocked the mountains, and a dozen Tibetan men and women drove more than thirty yaks, breaking a path through the snow to help the scientific team cross the snow mountain. Another time, a scientific team went from Damxung in northern Tibet to Tengri Lake, a high and cold area. Local Tibetans prepared Tibetan clothing to keep them warm and used yaks to carry tents and dried yak dung, accompanying them for seven days until the work was completed before returning home. Many others brought minerals from far away to give to the scientists for analysis and research. An old herdsman in northern Tibet's Qiangtang requested the scientists to go to his hometown. He said: "Come to our place! We have butter tea and dried beef for you to eat. I am familiar with every mountain and every road! I will take you to see the 'treasures'. In the past, when foreigners came, I didn't tell them anything." The help of the Tibetan people has enabled the scientists to reduce and overcome many difficulties in their work and discover many resources. (Xinhua News Agency)

    科学家们克服重重困难进行地质考察
    在康藏高原上发现蕴藏大量资源
    在康藏高原上的科学家们，在西藏人民的亲切帮助下，已经发现了大量资源。一年多来，他们穿过西康的横断山脉，到西藏北部的湖群地带，从唐古拉山南麓到喜马拉雅山下，在无数的深谷、山岭和草地上工作，行程合起来有两万里。他们经过初步的地质考察，在康藏高原上发现了几十个矿区和三十多种矿产，其中包括有色金属、黑色金属、化工原料、耐火原料、建筑原料、燃料和极有价值的稀有金属。如在某地发现的石墨矿是一个贮藏量很大质量最好的矿区；某湖里含藏着多量的硼砂，质地很纯。康藏高原上水力的蕴藏是无限的，仅雅鲁藏布江的支流一段约三百八十公里的地区内，就可能发挥六十万匹马力的电力。大片的森林被找到了，有一个约一万方公里面积的森林区，树木的直径多在一至三公尺左右，如果株株相连，从成都到拉萨大约可以排成一千八百行。科学家们还分析了康藏高原的土壤，研究了生长在河谷地带的各种作物，并发现了多种优良牧草。
    科学家们为了发现祖国所蕴藏的资源，常常抓着石缝里的小树，架上独木梯攀登断崖绝壁，在深山窄谷里，用斧头、铁镐开路前进，有时扫开积雪宿营，有时睡在石岩下。有些头发花白的老科学家，也像年轻人一样攀着索桥，滑过激流。去年三月底，他们中的一队曾冒着疾风，踏着没腰的积雪，翻过邦加拉雪山进入波密，他们的皮肤被风吹裂了，手脚也冻肿了，仍然坚持工作。
    藏族人民十分喜爱这些毛主席派来的科学家。许多僻远的牧场和荒谷里的藏民，听到他们要来的消息，几天前就准备好了柴草，搭好帐篷欢迎。有一次在波密，大雪封了山，十几个男女藏族人民赶着三十多头牦牛，在积雪中冲开了一条路，送科学工作队翻过雪山。又有一次，某科学工作队从藏北的当雄到地势高寒的腾格里湖去，当地藏胞给他们准备了御寒的藏族服装，并用牦牛驮着帐篷和干牛粪，陪伴他们走了七天的路程，一直到工作完了才回家。还有很多人带着矿石从很远的地方赶来，送给科学家们化验研究。藏北羌塘一个老牧民请求科学家们到他的家乡去。他说：“到我们那里去吧！有酥油和干牛肉给你们吃，每一座山每一条路我都熟悉！我带你们去看‘宝贝’去，过去外国人来，我什么也不告诉他们。”藏族人民的帮助，使科学家们减少和克服了工作中的许多困难，发现了很多资源。　（新华社）
