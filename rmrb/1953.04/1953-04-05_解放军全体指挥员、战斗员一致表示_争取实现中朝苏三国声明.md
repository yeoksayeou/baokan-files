Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army unanimously and warmly support the statement on the Korean issue by Premier Zhou of our country, Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea, and Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union.

    Commanders and fighters of various units of the Central and South China Military Region are determined to strive with the people of the whole country to realize the three-nation statement. Chen Hao, political instructor of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army guarding an island in the South China Sea, said: "These statements not only conform to the wishes of the Chinese and Korean people and the American people, but also conform to the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world. Whether the American government accepts the new suggestions put forward by the Chinese and Korean sides will be another test it faces before the people of the world." Li Guoren, a special-class labor model from a machine gun company in a certain unit during the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, said: "I fully support the statement of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov. Our purpose in strengthening economic construction and national defense construction is all for peace. These statements express our determination to strive for peace, and also express our unity in the cause of peace. However, if the United States still wants to delay or even expand the war, we are not afraid of war. In order to defend world peace and defend the construction of the motherland, we will always stand at the forefront of the motherland's defense and eliminate any enemy who dares to infringe upon the sacred territory of the motherland!"

    Commanders and fighters of various agencies and units of the Southwest Military Region have written letters and called the Political Department of the Military Region to express their warm support for the statement of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov. The senior cadre study group of the Logistics Department of the Military Region held a discussion. They unanimously believed that these statements expressed the consistent position and attitude of the peace and democracy camp in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Gu Yongwu, regimental commander of a certain unit of the Yunnan Military Region, said: "If American imperialism still has a little sincerity for peace, it should quickly accept the suggestions of the Chinese and Korean sides in order to reach a fair and reasonable agreement on the issue of prisoners of war and realize the desire of the people of the world for an armistice in Korea." Liu Zilin, Wei Xiaotang, Qi Peiyuan, Wu Tiancai, and Liu Shangwu, combat heroes and work models guarding the southwestern border, unanimously stated: We firmly support the statement of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov. Our People's Liberation Army will always be a staunch defender of peace.

    Zhao Xiao'an, an A-class combat model of a naval unit, said: "I am a naval soldier, and my responsibility is to defend the security of the motherland and world peace. I wholeheartedly support the statement of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov. In the future, I will work harder to improve my military skills and more vigilantly defend the security of the motherland." Zhang Xiuliang, a first-class people's hero of East China, said: "Peace-loving people all over the world warmly support the statement on the Korean issue by Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov, which shows that these statements are completely in line with the common interests of the people all over the world. We must fight to the end to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

    Wu Zhenguo, a combat hero from a certain unit of the North China Military Region, stated: The statement of Premier Zhou, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov represents the desire of peace-loving people all over the world. As long as all peace-loving people strengthen unity and heighten vigilance, they will surely be able to realize this desire.
