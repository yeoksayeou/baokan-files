Due to slow design progress and a lack of proactive leadership measures from the Ministry of Railways, most of the new railway construction projects across the country in 1953 failed to start on schedule.

The Ministry of Railways planned to start construction on 1,053 kilometers of new railway lines and lay tracks over 610 kilometers in 1953. With the exception of lines built by the First, Second, Fourth, and Tenth Engineering Bureaus, which had partially commenced construction in 1952, all other new lines were slated to begin construction this year. In the first quarter of this year, among the four lines that had partially commenced construction last year, the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway, built by the Second Engineering Bureau, continued construction. However, workers building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway under the First Engineering Bureau had to extend their winter training by about a month due to the failure to deliver designs in a timely manner. In addition, from January to March 15, over 152,000 workdays were lost, resulting in a loss of 2.4 billion yuan (construction has now started). The Fourth Engineering Bureau was supposed to receive design documents for twenty projects before the end of March for the Shacheng-Fengtai new line, but none were delivered by the design unit. Construction in the first quarter was limited to the five tunnels that were unfinished from last year. The design for the workers' living quarters on this line was also delayed. Over 1,800 workers from the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway realignment project, originally scheduled to be transferred to this line, had to extend their winter training by a month, incurring an additional winter training expense of 1 billion yuan. Projects that were newly planned for construction this year were also forced to delay their start dates. Furthermore, the Chengdu Construction Plant Project Office and the Fengtai Bridge Factory also experienced work stoppages.

The main reason why most new railway construction projects failed to start on schedule was the slow progress of design. The Ministry of Railways Design Bureau had a significant workload in 1953. Although five design sub-bureaus and eighteen survey and design teams had been established under the Design Bureau, the late start of design work, the heavy workload, and the inadequate resources all contributed. The leadership of the Design Bureau did not sufficiently assess this situation and therefore failed to earnestly organize and lead the design work. As a result, despite the heavy workload, many people were idle and had nothing to do. The Twelfth Survey and Design Team received only one task after its establishment last October and had nothing to do after working on it for a month until the end of March this year. Among them, the second sub-team, with a total of fifty-three people, only had seventeen people assisting on a certain line for a period of time after its establishment, while the remaining thirty-six people remained idle. The Eighth Survey and Design Team had eight recent graduates from technical schools who were not assigned to technical positions. When the students raised concerns, they were criticized for being "too ambitious and unrealistic." The instruments and equipment required for surveying and design were also not provided in a timely manner. When the survey and design team requested the design sub-bureau to resolve this issue, the design sub-bureau said: "The sub-bureau has just been established, let the design bureau resolve it!" The design bureau said: "Now that there is a sub-bureau, let the sub-bureau resolve it." The survey and design team reported: "Having a sub-bureau makes it even slower to solve problems." In addition, the political and ideological leadership in the design department has not been earnestly strengthened for a long time. The thinking of the survey and design personnel is quite chaotic, their work is careless, and the quality of the design is low. Design documents reviewed by the Technical Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Railways require an average of about 30 percent to be reworked, which is also an important reason for the slow design progress. Due to the poor organization and leadership of design work, coupled with changes in design requirements for some projects, design schedules that were set for three days often changed after only two days, leading other departments to joke with the Design Bureau cadres: "Which version is your design schedule now?" Moreover, despite repeated changes to the design schedule, it was rarely completed on time. For example, for the Shacheng-Fengtai line, the capital construction department, construction department, and design department had already reached an agreement. According to the agreed design schedule, twenty design documents should have been submitted before the end of March, but not a single one was delivered.

The Ministry of Railways underestimated the extent to to which design could not keep up with the construction progress. For example, when estimating the start time at the end of last year, it did not anticipate that approximately 30 percent of the design documents would need to be revised or reworked. In January of this year, the leadership of the Ministry of Railways, seeing the risk of failing to start on schedule, also took some measures, such as phased design, phased approval, signing preliminary contracts or individual contracts before formal contracts, and improving the organization of the Technical Appraisal Committee to strengthen the review of designs. However, because the passive situation had already formed, it was impossible to fundamentally change the slow design progress, and the serious danger of work stoppages was not recognized at the time. It was not until mid-March, when cadres from the New Railway Line Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways wrote to Premier Zhou to report the serious work stoppage situation in the construction of new railway lines, that the leadership of the Ministry of Railways convened a special meeting. However, they were still unclear about whether there were any work stoppages, how many there were, and what the reasons were. This fully demonstrated the passivity of the leadership of the Ministry of Railways and their lack of understanding of the actual situation. After several studies, it was finally confirmed that the work stoppage situation was serious, and a new schedule was rearranged for the completion of technical designs and the start of construction of new railways in order to avoid new work stoppages.

Currently, the Design Bureau, the Capital Construction Bureau, and the New Railway Line Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have not reached a unified understanding of the key issues related to the failure of new line projects to start on schedule, and are even blaming each other. The leadership of the Ministry of Railways must pay attention to these issues, overcome bureaucratic practices, and strengthen leadership over new line projects, especially design work.

### 铁道部没有采取积极办法改变设计迟缓的现象  全国新建铁路大部没有按期开工

    铁道部没有采取积极办法改变设计迟缓的现象
    全国新建铁路大部没有按期开工
    一九五三年的铁路新线建设工程，因设计进度迟缓，铁道部领导上缺乏积极措施，大都未能按期开工。
    铁道部一九五三年新线工程计划开工里程一千零五十三公里，铺轨六百一十公里。其中除第一、第二、第四、第十工程局所建各线一九五二年已部分开工外，其他新线都是今年新开工的工程。今年第一季度里，去年已部分开工的四条线路内，除第二工程局所建天成铁路南段继续施工外，第一工程局修建兰新铁路的工人，因设计未能及时交出，只好把冬训时间延长了一个月左右，此外，从一月至三月十五日，还窝工十五万二千余工日，损失二十四亿元（现已开工）。第四工程局所建沙城至丰台新线，三月底以前应接到二十个工程的设计文件，但设计单位全部没有交出，第一季度施工的还只是去年未完成的五个隧道；这条线上的工棚设计也迟迟未能交出，原决定调往该线的石太线改线工程处一千八百余名工人，不得不把冬训时间延长一个月，多开支冬训费十亿元。今年新开工的工程也被迫延迟了开工日期。此外，成都建厂工程处、丰台桥梁厂也都发生了窝工情况。
    铁路新线工程大都未能按期开工的主要原因是设计进度迟缓。铁道部设计局一九五三年的任务很大，在设计局下面虽已建立了五个设计分局，十八个勘测设计总队，但由于设计动手得迟，任务重，力量还是不足。设计局领导上对这种情况没有足够的估计，因而没有认真地把设计工作组织和领导起来，以致任务虽重，还有许多人闲着没有事做。第十二勘测设计总队去年十月成立后，至今年三月底只接到一个任务，做了一个月就没有事做了。其中二分队共五十三人，自成立后只有十七人到某线帮助了
    一个时期，其余三十六人一直闲着无事。第八勘测设计总队有八个刚从学校毕业的技术人员没有派在技术岗位上，学生们提意见，反被批评为“好高骛远，不切实际”。勘测设计所需要的仪器等设备也没有及时配备，勘测设计总队提请设计分局解决，设计分局说：“分局机构刚成立，叫设计局解决吧！”设计局说：“有了分局，就由分局解决。”勘测设计总队反映：“有了分局，解决问题更慢。”此外，设计部门的政治思想领导长期未曾认真加强，勘测设计人员的思想相当混乱，工作马虎，设计质量不高，经铁道部技术鉴定委员会审核的设计文件，平均有百分之三十上下需要返工，这也是设计迟缓的一个重要原因。由于对设计工作的组织和领导不力，再加上有些工程的设计要求变更，订了三天的设计进度表，两天就要变，以致其他部门的干部一遇到设计局的干部就说：“你们的设计进度表出了第几版啦？”而且设计进度表虽然再三变更，也很少按进度完成过。如沙城至丰台线，基本建设部门、施工部门和设计部门已订有协议，按照协议的设计进度表，三月底前应交出二十个设计文件，一件没有交出。
    铁道部对设计赶不上施工的情况估计不足，如去年年底预计开工时间时，就没有估计到会有百分之三十上下的设计文件须修正、返工。今年一月，铁道部领导上看到有不能如期开工的危险，也采取了
    一些措施，如分段设计，分段批准，先订草合同或个别合同，后订正式合同等办法，又健全了技术鉴定委员会的组织，加强设计的审核工作，但由于被动的情况已经形成，无法根本改变设计迟缓的情况，而且当时还没有认识窝工的严重危险。直到三月中旬，铁道部铁路新线工程总局有干部写信给周总理反映铁路新线建设中有严重窝工情况，铁道部领导上才召开了专门会议，但也搞不清楚究竟有没有窝工、窝工多少、窝工的原因是什么。这充分表现了铁道部领导上的被动和对实际情况心中无数，经过几次研究，最后才肯定了窝工情况是严重的，重新排定了新建铁路技术设计完成时间和工程开工时间表，以避免新的窝工。
    目前铁道部设计局、基本建设局、铁路新线工程总局对新线工程未能按期开工的关键问题尚未取得统一认识，甚至互相埋怨，铁道部领导上必须重视这些问题，克服官僚主义作风，加强对新线工程，特别是设计工作的领导。
