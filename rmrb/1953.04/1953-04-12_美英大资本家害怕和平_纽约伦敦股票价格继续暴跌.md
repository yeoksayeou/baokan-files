    U.S. and British Big Capitalists Fear Peace
    New York and London Stock Prices Continue to Plummet
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 11th] Prices of important war industry materials on the New York and London stock markets have plummeted again this week.
    According to American news agencies, on Monday (the 6th) alone, the total value of stocks on the New York stock market fell by $2.5 billion. This was the most drastic drop since the first week of the Korean War. More than three million shares were sold off. During the entire trading week ending on the 10th, industrial stocks fell by 4.53 points. Combined with the previous week, the total drop was 11.83 points. Stocks that fell sharply included those of railway and airline companies that had profited handsomely from the Korean War. Several so-called "blue-chip stocks," including those of General Motors, General Electric, Bethlehem Steel, and Kennecott Copper, also fell considerably. American news agencies admitted that the massive sell-off and the resulting price plunge were due to the fear among American capitalists that a Korean armistice might be realized.
    Prices of raw materials on the London market also plummeted again on the 7th. According to the BBC, the price of tin fell by £70 per ton on that day, nearly 8%. The price of rubber fell by 5%, dropping to its lowest level since the Korean War.

    美英大资本家害怕和平
    纽约伦敦股票价格继续暴跌
    【新华社十一日讯】纽约股票和伦敦市场上的重要战争工业原料的价格本周再度猛跌。
    据美国通讯社消息，星期一（六日）一天，纽约股票市场上的牌价总共就跌了二十五亿美元。造成朝鲜战争开始的第一周以来最剧烈的一次下跌。股票抛出超过三百万股。到十日为止的整个交易周中，工业股票下跌了四·五三点。与前一周合计，共跌落了一一·八三点。跌得很凶的股票中包括因朝鲜战争而利市百倍的铁路和飞机公司的股票。几种所谓“王牌股票”，包括通用汽车公司、通用电气公司、伯利恒钢铁公司、肯奈柯特铜公司等的股票也跌了不少。美国的通讯社承认，股票大量抛出因而价格暴跌是因为美国资本家害怕朝鲜停战可能实现。
    伦敦市场上原料价格在七日也再度猛跌，据英国广播公司消息，那一天锡的售价每吨跌了七十英镑，将近百分之八。橡胶价格跌落百分之五，降至朝鲜战争以来最低水平。
