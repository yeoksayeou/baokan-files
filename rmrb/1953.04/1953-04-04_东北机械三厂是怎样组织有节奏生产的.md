How the Northeast Machinery Third Factory Organizes Rhythmic Production
Northeast Machinery Third Factory Director Sha Ping

Editor's Note: Organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts is an advanced Soviet method of production management. Comrade Sha Ping, director of the Northeast Machinery Third Factory, provides a relatively systematic introduction based on the factory's experience in implementing this management method. This is valuable for reference as various factories and mines are currently discussing production plans and establishing and improving planning management to overcome the chaotic state of production management.

Characteristics of Machine Tool Production

In factories that manufacture machine tools, production has the following characteristics:

I. Complex production. A machine tool consists of thousands of parts, with tens of thousands of processing steps. Ensuring good coordination and reasonable cooperation between each process is a complex and meticulous task in the organization of enterprise production. At the same time, the types of tools and fixtures required for machine tool production are extremely numerous, with very high precision requirements. The types of raw materials used are also very complex. Sometimes, the factory cannot process and produce them and needs other enterprises and production departments to supply them, which is another extremely complex organizational task. Therefore, without highly scientific management methods, work stoppages due to waiting for materials, tools, or components will often occur.

II. Imbalanced equipment, imbalanced production. Our enterprises were taken over from the enemy and puppet regimes. These factories had the production characteristics of a colony and semi-colony: incomplete equipment, few precision machine tools, and a lack of large-scale equipment; strong repair capabilities, but weak production capabilities. For example, the Northeast Machinery Third Factory was a repair shop during the Japanese occupation, only able to process some parts for other enterprises. After we took over, we converted it into a factory producing machine tools. During the four years of production recovery, we successively added many relatively new precision machine tool equipment from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. However, because the factory had not been designed and renovated, the added equipment was also very unplanned. Coupled with the fact that production tasks were not fixed enough, an imbalance was formed with some equipment being extremely scarce and some equipment being surplus, causing production imbalances. This is a very unfavorable condition for organizing production, often causing chaotic situations such as work stoppages waiting for materials, equipment shutdowns, and rush production.

III. High product quality requirements, old equipment, and low technical level. If the quality of machine tools is not good, the quality of the products they manufacture will be unqualified, causing inestimable losses to society. We now require the quality of machine tools to meet Soviet standards. However, most of the remaining equipment has very poor precision, especially lacking measuring tools and instruments; the technical level of engineering and technical personnel is not high, and they lack on-site technical experience; 62% of the skilled workers were newly trained after liberation, and their technical level is also very low, unable to keep up with the requirements of objective development. Therefore, how to ensure product quality is a very important issue.

IV. After democratic reform, workers' enthusiasm for labor has greatly increased, and new creations often emerge, increasing production efficiency several times or dozens of times, often breaking through the level of balanced production. However, our production management level has not been able to increase accordingly, so the phenomenon of "hundreds of skills, hundreds of meters of cutting speed, everyone gets awards, but the task is not completed" has appeared. Many valuable advanced experiences are also just fleeting and have not been well promoted and consolidated.

Before the fourth quarter of 1951, because we did not have scientific methods but used the concept of "roughly" and "almost" to manage production, we were very passive in the face of such a complex factory. In order to complete the task, we used all means, blindly worked overtime, and rushed production. As a result, the labor organization and production order were disrupted, causing work stoppages waiting for materials, equipment shutdowns, tight schedules at the end and loose schedules at the beginning, delayed trial manufacturing, neglect of quality, damage to machine tools, disregard for safety, impact on the health of employees, frequent failure to complete tasks, and monthly financial losses.

Later, we learned and promoted the management method of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," and the production outlook in 1952 was completely new. Output increased by 2.39 times compared with 1951; the total value of production increased by 90% compared with 1951; product quality was significantly improved, eliminating third-grade products in January and second-grade products in November; labor productivity increased by 89%; costs decreased by 5.75%, reversing the previous imbalance of income and expenditure.

Where to Start Organizing Rhythmic Production

Imbalanced equipment, extremely complex production, coupled with a lack of planning and organization, have caused a chaotic phenomenon in production, with intermittent and rushed periods: the assembly workshop is idle at the beginning of the month because there are no parts, and at the end of the month, when the parts are rushed out, it works overtime, adds workers, and rushes frantically. In order to rush parts for the assembly workshop, the machining workshop produces crudely, resulting in poor component quality, completely disrupting the plan, reducing production efficiency, and relatively weakening the strength, so that the machining workshop has become the weakest link. Based on this situation, we decided to take the production section as the center and focus on improving the production of the machining workshop to drive other workshops.

The specific approach is: with the production section as the center, establish instruction charts, grasp the production situation, and organize the complex production process, raw material supply, equipment, and labor. After clearing the warehouse and clarifying the production situation, detailed lists of raw material collection, parts collection, and component assembly were established. These three detailed lists are the basic data for organizing rhythmic production. Based on these data and the requirements of the task, an assembly plan table is compiled, and then, in reverse order, the number and time of machines packaged and put into storage are pushed forward: when to equip how many, when to need how many components, and when to need what raw materials. According to the requirements of the planned task, four types of progress charts are established - raw material collection progress chart, parts collection progress chart, partial assembly progress chart, and flow reserve chart (the construction section also has a tool collection progress chart, and the supply and marketing section also has a raw material collection progress chart). With these instruction charts, the entire factory's production situation is clear at a glance. From the comparison between the planned and actual situation, leading cadres can see where the problem is and who is responsible. Based on this discovery, they can conduct in-depth inspections of the work and promptly solve these key problems that affect the completion of the production plan. In this way, leading cadres have foresight, overcome blindness, and the work changes from passive to active. Preparations before production can be carried out more systematically than in the past, and the completion of the production plan is guaranteed. Losses due to management reasons are greatly reduced. The losses suffered by our factory due to shutdowns in 1952 were reduced by more than four-fifths compared with 1951.

In terms of rectifying and strengthening the machining workshop, we did the following:

First, improve the organization. Taking planning work as the center, appoint a dedicated person to make workshop operation plans, focusing on strengthening the workshop's original record work and statistical work, so that the operation plan gradually becomes practical and guides production. At the same time, establish a material warehouse and tool room, strengthen preparations before production, strengthen the connection with other workshops and sections, and supervise and inspect whether they have well fulfilled their responsibilities in completing the task in a balanced manner. In addition, set up a technical supervisor (preferably a technician) to uniformly manage technical work, responsible for leading foremen to solve workshop technical problems and implement technical management systems; supplement personnel, and delineate the scope of work responsibilities.

Second, establish workshop instruction charts to grasp the production situation. First, summarize the workshop's past production situation, find out the regularity of production, and then compile an operation plan according to the regularity of production, establish a parts process progress chart (for enforcement management), a partial parts progress chart (for the workshop director), a standard plan table, a machine tool load table (for the planner), and a group progress chart (for group workers). The main function of these charts is to make it easier for management cadres to accurately grasp the specific production situation of the workshop. According to these situations, the workshop planner clarifies the situation of machine tools, workpieces, and workers, and also clarifies the unbalanced situation of parts in production. Then, according to the priority of the assembly workshop's need for parts, a progress plan is compiled and issued to workers for production on a daily and ten-day basis. After one or two months, when production reaches a considerable balance, personnel are fixed, a standard plan table is made, and all factors affecting production (such as waste products, process turnover, and turnover volume) are taken into account. Then, different methods of feeding materials are adopted according to the different types of parts (large, medium, and small) - large parts are fed by flow method, medium parts are fed by batch method, and small parts are fed by alternating method, to fully exert production efficiency and rationally use working capital.

Third, through the compilation of operation plans, organize labor division specialization to improve labor productivity. When making operation plans, based on the actual production situation of the workshop, fix machine tools, fix operators, and fix workpieces according to the principle of not moving from the original place. After the workers' operations are specialized, tools and templates are saved, and technology is easy to master, so many skills appear, and labor productivity increases by about 30%. On this basis, organizational reforms are carried out, and similar specialized production groups in the workshop are organized to establish similar specialized workshops. After this reform, due to the separation of rough work and fine work, workers operate more specifically, and technicians are used more rationally. Because a workshop completes the entire process of parts according to the specialty of parts, the quality responsibility system for parts is clearer than in the past, and it is easier for foremen to lead and be responsible; at the same time, the connection of production processes is close, greatly shortening the time for round-trip transportation; the amount of reserves in the production process is reduced, thus saving working capital; rough work is concentrated in the preparation workshop, less precise machine tools are responsible for rough work tasks, precise machine tools are used for fine work tasks, the use of equipment is more rational, the protection of precise machine tools is better than in the past, and the workshop environment and hygiene are also improved.

Fourth, solve the problem of turnover volume of finished products, semi-finished products, and work-in-process in production to achieve rhythmic production. The turnover volume in production includes process occupancy, flow reserves, and insurance reserves. Process occupancy is required for the transfer between various processes in the production process. Like production requires working capital, the amount is determined by the length of the process and the length of the production cycle. Flow reserves are necessary to make the production cycles of semi-finished product warehouses, casting and forging warehouses, and raw material warehouses, as well as assembly workshops, machining workshops, and casting and forging workshops more connected. According to our factory's experience, the number of semi-finished product warehouses and casting and forging warehouses should be the amount of one month's production tasks, and the amount of raw materials can be handled according to the cycle prescribed by the state. Insurance reserves are prepared in advance to make up for accidents in production. The determination of the turnover volume in production must be reasonable and stipulate the minimum and maximum limits. Too much will accumulate working capital, and too little will affect production. The machinery factory consciously reduced the production turnover volume through operation plans, adopting the method of promoting advanced experience, and improving production efficiency. After the turnover volume problem is solved, it can enter rhythmic production. After the machining workshop solves these problems, the chaotic phenomenon of production is reduced, and then the piece-rate wage system is vigorously promoted and advanced production experience is promoted, and the production outlook is immediately changed.

After the machining workshop was rectified and strengthened, it became a stronger link in the whole factory. At this time, the assembly workshop and the casting and forging workshop became weak links. So, we established instruction charts in the assembly workshop and casting and forging workshop to manage production, organized labor division through operation plans, and promoted Yang Shouxun's sand casting experience and Liu Lifu's forging experience. Now the assembly capacity has risen to exceed the processing capacity; the strength of the casting and forging workshop has also been significantly improved. After organizing rhythmic production, it is necessary to constantly take a series of technical organization measures (including promoting advanced experience) according to the problems indicated in the charts, overcome weak links, and promote production forward. This is the key issue in organizing rhythmic production. In particular, promoting advanced experience in weak links with purpose, planning, and steps has a decisive effect on promoting the progress of rhythmic production. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen technical management, establish and strictly technical inspection systems, formulate and implement technical operating procedures based on workers' advanced operating methods, unify and strengthen tool management systems, and do a good job in technical preparations before production. Improve work from all aspects of technical management to overcome various factors affecting production, so that rhythmic production can be further strengthened and consolidated.

While organizing rhythmic production, it is necessary to organize red banner competition movements. Through the red banner competition, the masses are organized and the realization of the operation plan is turned into the masses' conscious action. At the end of each month, we distribute the progress plan for the next month and the quality requirements to the masses for discussion, and then check the implementation on a daily and ten-day basis. Those who complete the task are awarded red banners and praised; those who do not complete the task are urged to ensure the balanced completion of the state plan on a daily and ten-day basis. This competition strengthens workers' legal concept and spirit of mutual assistance in completing the state plan, strengthens workers' care and management of machine tools and tools, and also strengthens the administrative responsibility for preparing for production and solving specific problems.

    东北机械三厂是怎样组织有节奏生产的
    东北机械三厂厂长　沙平
    编者按：按指示图表组织有节奏生产是苏联先进的管理生产的方法。东北机械三厂厂长沙平同志根据该厂推行这一管理方法的经验，作了一个比较系统的介绍。这对于目前各厂矿正在讨论生产计划，建立与健全计划管理以克服生产管理上混乱状态是有参考价值的。
    机床生产的特点
    在制造机床的工厂里，生产上有这样几个特点：
    一、生产复杂。组成一台机床的零件多到几千种，加工程序达数万道，要使每道工序的生产衔接得好，配合得协调合理，是企业生产组织上复杂而细致的工作。同时机床生产所需用的工具卡具种类极其繁多，精密度要求又极高，所用的原材料的种类也很复杂，有时本厂不能加工生产，需要其他企业生产部门供应，这又是一件极其复杂的组织工作。因此，如果没有高度的科学的管理方法，停工待料、待工具、待部件的事情就会经常发生。
    二、设备不平衡，生产不平衡。我们的企业是从敌伪手中接收过来的，这些工厂带着一种殖民地、半殖民地的生产特性：设备残缺不全，精密机床少，大型设备缺乏；修配能力大，生产能力小。如东北机械三厂，在伪满时代是一个修配厂，只能给其他企业加工一些零件。我们接收以后，把它改为生产机床的工厂，在四年恢复生产的过程中，曾陆续增添了不少苏联的和人民民主国家的比较新的精密机床设备，但因为工厂未经过设计改造，增添的设备也十分缺乏计划性，加之生产任务不够固定，所以便形成某些设备奇缺，某些设备过剩，引起生产上的不平衡。这是组织生产时很不利的条件，经常因此造成停工待料、设备停歇、突击生产的混乱局面。
    三、产品要求质量高，设备旧，技术水平低。机床的质量不好，它所制造的产品的质量就不合格，将给社会造成不可估计的损失。我们现在要求机床的质量要达到苏联的标准。但是残留的设备却绝大部分是精密度很差的，特别是缺少量具仪器；工程技术人员的技术水平不高，又缺乏现场技术经验；百分之六十二的技术工人是解放后新培养的，技术水平也很低，跟不上客观的发展要求。因而如何保证产品质量便是一个很重要的问题。
    四、经过民主改革后，工人劳动情绪高涨，经常出现新的创造，生产效率数倍、十数倍地提高，经常突破均衡生产的水平。但是我们的生产管理水平却不能相应地提高，于是便出现了“窍门千百个，切（削）速（度）千百米，全体得了奖，任务没完成”的现象。很多宝贵的先进经验也只是昙花一现，没有很好地推广与巩固。
    一九五一年第四季度以前，由于我们没有科学方法，而是以“大概”“差不多”的观念来管理生产，因此，面对着这样一个复杂的工厂，领导上工作十分被动，为了完成任务，不择方法，盲目加班加点，突击生产。结果打乱了劳动组织和生产秩序，停工待料、设备停歇、前松后紧、拖延试造、忽视质量、损坏机床、不顾保安、影响职工健康、经常完不成任务、财务上月月亏损。
    后来，我们学习与推广了“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的管理方法，一九五二年的生产面貌为之一新。产量较一九五一年提高了二点三九倍；生产总值较一九五一年增长了百分之九十；产品质量显著提高，一月份消灭了三级品，十一月份消灭了二级品；劳动生产率提高了百分之八十九；成本降低了百分之五点七五，扭转了以往收支不平衡的状况。
    组织有节奏生产从哪里下手
    设备不平衡，生产异常复杂，加上工作缺乏计划性和组织性，便造成了生产上时而间断时而突击的混乱现象：装配车间月初因为没有零件空闲着，月末零件赶出来了，就加班加点、添工人、拚命突击。加工车间为了给装配车间赶零件，便粗制滥造，弄得部件质量低劣，计划完全被打乱，生产效率降低，相对地削弱了力量，结果使得加工车间成了最薄弱的环节。根据这样的情况，我们便决定了第一步以生产科为中心，以改进机械加工车间的生产为主，以此来带动其他车间。
    具体的做法是：以生产科为中心，建立指示图表、掌握生产情况，把复杂的生产过程、原材料供应和设备、劳动力等组织起来。经过清查仓库，弄清楚生产情况，建立了原材料搜集、零件搜集、部件装配等明细表。这三个明细表是组织节奏生产的基本资料。根据这些资料和任务的要求，编制出装配计划表，然后按反顺序方向，从包装入库的机器数目和时间向前推算：什么时候装备多少，什么时候需要多少部件，什么时候需要什么原材料。根据计划任务的要求，建立四种进度表——原材料搜集进度表、零件搜集进度表、部分装配进度表、流动储备量情况表（施工科还有工具搜集进度表，供销科还有原材料搜集进度表）。有了这些指示图表，对全厂的生产情况就一目了然了。从计划与实际情况的对比中，领导干部可以看出问题在哪里，是谁的责任。可以根据这个发现深入地检查工作，及时地解决这些影响生产计划完成的关键问题。这样，领导干部就有了预见性，克服了盲目性，工作由被动转为主动，生产前的准备工作可以比过去有计划地进行，生产计划的完成也就有了保证，由于管理上的原因引起的停工损失也就大为减少。我厂一九五二年因停工所受的损失就较一九五一年减少了五分之四以上。
    在整顿和加强加工车间方面，我们做了这几件工作：
    第一、健全组织。以计划工作为中心，设专人作车间作业计划，着重加强车间原始记录工作和统计工作，使作业计划逐渐做到切合实际，指导生产。同时建立材料库和工具室，加强生产前的准备工作，加强与其他车间和科股间的联系并督促、检查他们是否很好地实现了在均衡完成任务中应负的责任。此外设主管技术员（最好是技师）统一掌管技术工作，负责领导工长解决车间技术问题，贯彻技术管理制度；补充人员，划清工作的职责范围。
        第二、建立车间指示图表，以掌握生产情况。先总结车间过去的生产情况，找出生产的规律性，然后根据生产规律性编制作业计划，建立零件工序进度表（执令管理用）、部分零件进度表（车间主任用）、标准计划表、机床负荷表（计划员用）、小组进度表（小组工人用）。这些图表的主要作用是使管理干部便于确实掌握车间具体生产情况。车间计划员根据这些情况，把机床、工作物与工人的情况弄清楚，把生产中零件不平衡情况也弄明白之后，即根据装配车间需要零件的先后缓急，编制进度计划，发给工人按日按旬进行生产。经过一两个月，待生产达到相当平衡状态，即进行定员，作标准计划表，把一切影响生产的因素（如废品、工序周转及周转量等）都考虑进去，然后按大、中、小不同类型零件采取不同方式投料——大件采取流水方式投料，中件采取成批方式投料，小件采取轮番方式投料，以充分发挥生产效率和合理运用流动资金。
    第三、通过编制作业计划，组织劳动分工专业化，以提高劳动生产率。在做作业计划时，以车间生产实况，按原地不动的原则固定机床、固定操作者、固定工作物。工人们的操作专门化以后，节省了工具样板，技术也易于熟练，因之窍门出现很多，劳动生产率提高约百分之三十左右。在这个基础上再进行组织上的改革，将车间的同类型的专业生产小组组织起来，成立同类型的专业化工段、车间。经过这一改革，由于粗工和精工分开，工人操作更专门，技工使用得也更为合理。由于按零件专业，一个工段完成零件全部过程，因此零件的质量责任制较过去明确，工长更便于领导与负责；同时生产工序衔接密切，大大缩短了往返运输的时间；生产过程中的储备量减少了，因而也节约了流动资金；粗工集中在准备车间，不太精密的机床担负粗工任务，精密的机床作精工任务，设备运用得更合理，精密机床的保护也较过去好，车间环境卫生也改善了。
    第四、解决生产中成品、半制品、在制品等的周转量问题，以达到有节奏生产的目的。生产中的周转量，包括工序占用量、流动储备量及保险储备量。工序占用量是生产过程中各工序间转移所需要的，如同生产需要流动资金一样，量的多少视工序长短和生产循环期长短而确定。流动储备量是使半成品库、铸锻件库和原材料库，以及装配车间、加工车间、铸锻车间生产周期更相衔接所必需的。数量多少，根据我厂的经验，半成品库和铸锻件库以一个月的生产任务数量为宜，原材料多少可按国家规定的周期办理。保险储备量是为了弥补生产中发生事故而预先准备好的。生产中周转量的确定，一定要合理，并规定最低与最高的限额，过多要积压流动资金，过少要影响生产。机械厂是有意识地通过作业计划，采用推广先进经验，提高生产效率的办法而逐步缩小了生产周转量的。周转量问题解决之后，就可以步入有节奏的生产了。加工车间解决了这些问题之后，减少了生产混乱现象，再抓紧推行计件工资制度和推广先进生产经验，生产面貌便立刻改观了。
    加工车间经整顿与加强之后，变成了全厂较强的环节，这时，装配车间和铸锻车间又变成薄弱的环节了。于是我们就在装配车间和铸锻车间建立指示图表管理生产，通过作业计划组织劳动分工，推广了杨守训的翻砂经验和刘立富的锻造经验。现在装配能力又上升到超过了加工能力；铸锻车间的力量也显著地提高了。组织有节奏生产之后，必须经常不断地根据图表中所指示的问题，采取一系列的技术组织措施（包括推广先进经验），克服薄弱环节，推动生产前进。这是组织有节奏生产的关键问题。尤其是有目的、有计划、有步骤地在薄弱环节上推广先进经验，更对推动节奏生产前进有决定性的作用。此外，还必须加强技术管理，建立与严格技术检验制度，根据工人的先进操作方法，制订与贯彻技术操作规程，统一与加强工具管理制度，搞好生产前的技术准备工作，从技术管理的各个方面改进工作，以克服影响生产的各个因素，使有节奏生产进一步加强与巩固。
    在组织节奏生产的同时，必须组织红旗竞赛运动。通过红旗竞赛，把群众组织起来，把实现作业计划变为群众自觉的行动。我们在每月末将下月的进度计划和对质量的要求发给群众讨论，然后按日按旬检查执行情况，完成者插上红旗，予以表扬；未完成者，予以督促，以此保证按日按旬均衡地完成国家计划。这种竞赛加强了工人们完成国家计划的法律观念和互助精神，加强了工人们对机床、工具的爱护与保管，同时也加强了行政上对生产前的准备工作和具体解决问题的责任心。
