    Urgent Need to Solve the Problem of 300 Disaster-Stricken Households in Shifo Temple District, Shenyang City

    A letter from Wu Junting, Secretary of the CPC Shifo Temple District Committee in Shenyang City, and committee members Ma Junshan and Zhang Chengzhi: We are extremely anxious about the difficulties in the lives and production of the 300 disaster-stricken households in Dibei, Shifo Temple District, Shenyang City. This problem urgently needs to be solved.

    Shifo Temple District suffered a severe flood in August 1951. Under the leadership of the superior Party committee and government, and through active rescue efforts, nearly 30,000 people in the district escaped the flood. Subsequently, a series of relief and resettlement efforts were carried out, enabling most of the disaster victims to be properly resettled and rebuild their homes. For example, in the four administrative villages of Lujia Village, Dadingpao, Lamatai, and Wujianfang, with the support of the People's Government, more than 900 houses were built out of the more than 1,000 houses that were washed away by the flood. They have also initially restored their production capacity through self-reliance in production.

    However, the flood has destroyed the small dike of the Liao River, and the lives and property of the disaster victims living north of the dike are still threatened by the Liao River. In the spring of 1952, the head of Shifo Temple District proposed to the Municipal People's Government to move the disaster victims north of the dike. After approval, a formal notice was issued in February to more than 3,000 people in the four administrative villages of Lujia Village, Dadingpao, etc., north of the dike, to move. The disaster victims were reluctant to leave their homes and said painfully, "If you want us to move, why did you ask us to rebuild our homes?" When the relocation was first mobilized, the cadres of the district government emphasized persuasion. Later, when they saw that the disaster victims were slow to move, they implemented a compulsory order. They held mass meetings in the villages north of the dike, threatening the disaster victims, saying, "In the past, it was mobilization. Today, you have to move whether you want to or not. If you don't move, we will use shovels to grab [your belongings]!" They also mobilized fifty or sixty migrant workers from nearby villages to tear down the houses of the disaster victims who refused to move, and fifteen houses were torn down at that time. The disaster victims were forced to move in great dissatisfaction. Eight hundred and fifty-five newly built houses were torn down. According to incomplete information, more than ten people died from worry and illness due to the relocation. For example, Gui Ming of Qijia Village had just built three very sturdy houses after the flood, which were torn down. After moving, he returned to the original house site and cried bitterly. He went back and died of illness. Yang Shulin moved to Daziying, and died of illness after more than ten days without food, clothing, and anger. After forcing the disaster victims to move, they were not properly resettled. One hundred and nineteen households who moved to the south of the dike had no way to produce or live. The disaster victims who moved to other districts (districts within the suburbs) also did not have their production and living problems properly solved. The land given was at most one mu per person, which could not meet their living needs. Most of the houses were rented, and the landlords would take the houses back after four or six months. They could not afford to rent, so they had to move back to their original place. In addition, some people pretended to move at the time of forced relocation (sending away the women, but the men did not leave, tearing down the big houses and leaving the small houses, etc.), so from July and August of last year, the disaster victims began to return to their original places one after another. Their household registrations are outside, but people have returned to dig cellars and build shacks to live in, becoming scattered people. As of March 18 this year, nearly 300 households of disaster victims had moved back to their original places.

    In August 1952, when we discovered that the disaster victims north of the dike were moving back, we conducted a timely investigation and reported this situation to the Municipal Party Committee's Agricultural Committee on September 5. The District People's Government immediately reported to the Suburban Office of the Municipal People's Government, but neither received any reply. The disaster victims continued to move back, and the District Committee wrote a report to the Municipal Party Committee's Agricultural Committee on January 20 this year; at the same time, every time (eight times) we went to the Municipal Party Committee's Agricultural Committee for meetings, we raised this issue, but it still did not attract the attention of the Municipal Party Committee's Agricultural Committee, nor did it make any specific instructions. Until March 14, the city instructed: "Disaster victims who have moved back should be mobilized to move out again, otherwise no relief will be given." And it said: "Those who have moved back should still be persuaded to move out; otherwise, if the Liao River rises slightly, they will all be hit by the disaster, and relief will have to be carried out again. This will not solve the problem, but only accommodate them. Therefore, no funds are planned for relief." We believe that this is a bureaucratic approach. As early as the winter of 1951, when Shenyang City distributed clothes to disaster victims, there were many problems. At that time, there were cotton clothes, but only single clothes were issued; there were good shoes, but only unmatched bad shoes were issued; the good cloth donated by farmers in the suburbs of the city was not issued to the disaster victims at all. Last spring, when it was almost time to take off the cotton clothes, cotton was distributed, but the disaster victims did not want it and reflected, "Raincoats are sent after it rains, and cotton comes after the freezing is over." We cannot implement such instructions that do not care about the suffering of the masses and do not solve practical problems, so on March 18, we reported the bureaucratism in handling the relocation of disaster victims north of the dike to the Municipal Party Committee, but received no reply. At the same time, we also gave a report to the Municipal Party Committee's Agricultural Committee. We also did not receive any specific instructions.

    Regarding the problem of disaster victims north of the dike, it has been more than six months since we started raising opinions to the Municipal Party Committee's Agricultural Committee. Now, the Municipal People's Government is putting the disaster relief funds donated by people from all walks of life in Shenyang City in the bank and not distributing them to the disaster victims, but only asking us to mobilize the disaster victims to move. The disaster victims have repeatedly stated that they are unwilling to leave because they have no livelihood after moving out, while here they have already built shacks and cellars. Although they are eating tofu dregs, they are preparing for spring plowing. In the past, the Municipal People's Government treated disaster relief work and the relocation of disaster victims with bureaucracy, which has already created a very bad influence among the masses. If we do not promptly remedy this now, it will create an even worse influence. We urgently hope that the leadership will quickly send someone to the site to inspect and handle it properly, so as to avoid further misfortunes for the disaster victims.

### 沈阳市石佛寺区三百户灾民问题急待解决

    沈阳市石佛寺区三百户灾民问题急待解决
    中共沈阳市石佛寺区区委会书记吴俊廷、委员马俊山和张成志来信：我们对于沈阳市石佛寺区堤北三百户灾民的生活和生产的困难，焦急万分。这一问题急待解决。
    石佛寺区在一九五一年八月遭受了一次严重的水灾。在上级党委和政府领导下，经过积极抢救，全区近三万多人口脱出水险。以后又进行了一系列的救济与安置工作，使大部灾民得到妥善安置，重建了家园。如鲁家村、大丁泡、拉马台、五间房等四个行政村在人民政府扶持下，即将大水冲倒的千余间房屋，盖起了九百余间。他们并在生产自救中初步恢复了生产能力。
    但是洪水已把辽河小堤冲毁，在堤北居住的灾民的生命财产，仍受着辽河的威胁。一九五二年春天，石佛寺区区长向市人民政府提议把堤北灾民迁出去，经批准后于二月正式通知堤北鲁家村、大丁泡等四行政村三千余口人搬家。灾民们不愿背井离乡，非常痛心地说：“既要我们搬家，为什么又叫我们重建家园？”开始动员搬家时，区政府的干部还着重说服，后来他们见灾民迟迟不搬，就实行了强迫命令的办法。他们在堤北各村召开群众大会，威吓灾民说：“过去是动员，今天搬也得搬，不搬也得搬，再不搬就用铁锹抢！”他们并由附近村动员了五、六十个民工去给不搬家的灾民扒房子，当时扒了十五间。灾民在极大的不满中被迫搬家。把刚刚盖好的房子扒了八百五十五间。据不完全了解，为搬家而着急生病死的有十余人。如祁家屯桂明，水灾后，刚盖起三间很结实的房子，就扒掉了，搬家后他回到原房场处大哭一场，回去就病死了。杨树林搬到达子营，无吃无穿加气生病十几天就死了。强迫灾民搬家后，对灾民又没有进行妥善的安置。搬到堤南的一百十九户生产生活都无办法。搬到外区（郊区内各区）的灾民，生产生活问题也未得到适当解决。给的土地最多一人合一亩，满足不了生活需要，房子大部分是借住的，四个月、半年以后房东就要收房子，自己又租不起，只得搬回原地。再加上强迫搬家的当时有的人就是假搬（送走妇女，男人没走，扒了大房留下小房等等），因此从去年七、八月间，灾民就陆续回到原地。他们的户口在外边，人都回来挖地窖子和搭马架窝棚住，成为散民。至今年三月十八日，搬回原地的灾民已将近三百户。
    一九五二年八月，我们发现堤北灾民向回搬家时，就及时进行了调查，并于九月五日将这一情况报告市委农委，区人民政府即报告市人民政府郊区办事处，均未得到任何答复。灾民继续搬回来，区委又于今年一月二十日写报告给市委农委；同时每次（有八次）到市委农委开会都提出这问题，仍未引起市委农委重视，也未作过任何具体指示。直至三月十四日，市里指示说：“搬回之灾民，再动员搬出，否则不予救济。”并且说：“又迁回者，仍应说服迁出；否则辽河稍一涨水，即全部被灾，又要进行救济，如此下去，并未解决问题，只是迁就而已。因此，不拟拨款救济。”我们认为这是官僚主义的做法。早在一九五一年冬季，沈阳市发放灾民衣服时，就有许多问题，当时有棉衣却只发单衣；有好鞋却发不成双的坏鞋；市郊农民捐助的好布，一尺也没发给灾民。去年春，快脱棉衣了，才发放棉花，可是灾民不愿意要了，并反映：“下过雨送蓑衣，挨完冻棉花才来。”我们无法执行这样不关心群众疾苦、不解决实际问题的指示，即于三月十八日将处理堤北灾民搬家问题中的官僚主义报告给市委，未得答复，同时，我们又给市委农委一份报告。也未得到具体指示。
    关于堤北灾民的问题，从我们开始向市委农委提意见起，到现在已经六个多月了。现在，市人民政府把沈阳市各界人民捐助的救灾款放在银行里不发给灾民，只是叫我们动员灾民搬家。灾民再三表示不愿走，因为他们搬出后生活无着，而这里则已弄好了马架子、地窨子。虽然吃的是豆腐渣，但他们正在准备春耕。过去市人民政府由于以官僚主义对待救灾工作和处理灾民搬家问题，在群众中已经造成极不好的影响，现在如果再不及时挽救，将造成更坏的影响。我们急迫地希望领导上迅速派专人到现地检查，作妥善处理，以免灾民再发生不幸事件。
